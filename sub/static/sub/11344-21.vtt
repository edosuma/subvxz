In the criminal justice system,

00:06.974 --> 00:10.811
sexually based offenses are
considered especially heinous.

00:10.844 --> 00:13.514
In New York City,
the dedicated detectives

00:13.547 --> 00:15.549
who investigate
these vicious felonies

00:15.583 --> 00:16.817
are members
of an elite squad

00:16.850 --> 00:19.153
known as
the Special Victims Unit.

00:19.187 --> 00:21.089
These are their stories.

00:22.256 --> 00:24.125
How did you feel
when your mom's boyfriend

00:24.158 --> 00:25.259
touched you like that?

00:25.293 --> 00:27.195
I felt sad.

00:27.228 --> 00:28.462
I thought
it was my fault.

00:28.496 --> 00:29.463
But it wasn't.

00:29.497 --> 00:31.165
Whose fault was it?

00:31.199 --> 00:32.533
It was his fault.

00:32.566 --> 00:34.502
That's what a counselor
at my school said.

00:34.535 --> 00:35.836
She helped me

00:35.869 --> 00:37.071
when I told her
what happened.

00:37.105 --> 00:38.172
Good for you, Sabrina.

00:38.206 --> 00:39.207
Thanks.

00:39.240 --> 00:42.276
Now whenever Sabrina
gets touched in an unsafe way,

00:42.310 --> 00:44.478
she'll say no,
then go.

00:44.512 --> 00:47.848
And what will you do if you're
ever touched in an unsafe way?

00:47.881 --> 00:50.751
Say no,
then go!

00:50.784 --> 00:51.752
Right.

00:51.785 --> 00:53.187
Now listen up, guys.

00:53.221 --> 00:55.156
If you want
to share something today

00:55.189 --> 00:56.157
or have any questions,

00:56.190 --> 00:59.693
you can talk to us privately
in a few minutes.

00:59.727 --> 01:01.829
It's not okay to rub boogers
on your sister.

01:01.862 --> 01:03.597
Would you want boogers
rubbed on you?

01:03.631 --> 01:05.533
No.

01:05.566 --> 01:06.634
Bleh!

01:06.667 --> 01:08.536
Me neither.

01:08.569 --> 01:09.603
So next time
she pulls your hair,

01:09.637 --> 01:10.704
just tell
your mom, okay?

01:10.738 --> 01:11.872
Okay.

01:11.905 --> 01:13.141
Okay.

01:13.174 --> 01:14.575
Hi.

01:14.608 --> 01:18.512
Come on over.
What's your name?

01:18.546 --> 01:19.580
Colin.

01:19.613 --> 01:21.649
Hi, Colin.
I'm Jessie.

01:21.682 --> 01:24.585
My friend said rubbing weenies
feels good.

01:28.256 --> 01:29.523
Did your friend
touch you there?

01:29.557 --> 01:30.691
No.

01:30.724 --> 01:32.760
But he said he does it
and it's fun.

01:32.793 --> 01:34.362
What's your friend's name?

01:34.395 --> 01:36.197
Jake.

01:36.230 --> 01:37.865
That's him.

01:39.500 --> 01:41.202
Did you ask Colin if you could
touch his weenie?

01:41.235 --> 01:42.370
Yes.

01:44.505 --> 01:47.508
Does anybody
touch yours?

01:47.541 --> 01:48.709
Yes.

01:48.742 --> 01:51.812
Okay. Who touches you?

01:51.845 --> 01:53.147
I'm not allowed
to tell.

01:53.181 --> 01:55.183
How come?

01:55.216 --> 01:56.384
Because I'll get
in trouble.

01:56.417 --> 01:58.219
Come on, Jake.

01:58.252 --> 02:00.154
We're gonna be late
for my soccer game.

02:00.188 --> 02:01.289
Now hold on, Teddy.
What is going on?

02:01.322 --> 02:04.192
Are you Jake's mom?
Yes. And you are?

02:04.225 --> 02:06.160
Elliot Stabler
from the NYPD.

02:06.194 --> 02:07.795
But what happened?
Did somebody hurt Jake?

02:07.828 --> 02:10.130
He said someone's
been abusing him.

02:11.665 --> 02:13.267
Oh no.

02:13.301 --> 02:14.702
Not again.

03:14.262 --> 03:16.297
How could I have
missed this again?

03:16.330 --> 03:17.631
This isn't the first time
that Jacob's been abused?

03:17.665 --> 03:19.800
Not Jake, Teddy.

03:19.833 --> 03:21.635
His older brother.

03:21.669 --> 03:22.970
What happened?

03:23.003 --> 03:25.339
While I was...
pregnant with Jake,

03:25.373 --> 03:27.541
I caught my ex-husband
touching Teddy.

03:27.575 --> 03:29.377
While I was carrying
his child,

03:29.410 --> 03:30.844
he was raping our son.

03:30.878 --> 03:31.912
What's your ex's name?

03:31.945 --> 03:32.913
Gregory Hensal.

03:32.946 --> 03:34.948
But now the boy's have
your maiden name, Winnock?

03:34.982 --> 03:36.317
You're damn right.

03:36.350 --> 03:37.318
I don't want them
walking around

03:37.351 --> 03:38.519
with a daily reminder
of him.

03:38.552 --> 03:40.421
Did you report
the abuse?

03:40.454 --> 03:41.689
He pled guilty to sodomy.

03:41.722 --> 03:43.023
He got 10 years.

03:43.056 --> 03:43.991
He was out
in seven.

03:44.024 --> 03:44.992
It was a joke.

03:45.025 --> 03:46.960
Does Gregory have

03:46.994 --> 03:48.862
any contact
with the boys?

03:48.896 --> 03:49.963
Bastard filed
for visitation last year.

03:49.997 --> 03:50.998
Teddy refused
to see him,

03:51.031 --> 03:52.700
but Jake begged me
to let him go.

03:52.733 --> 03:53.734
And did you?

03:53.767 --> 03:55.269
No.

03:55.303 --> 03:57.505
Until the judge took it
out of my hands

03:57.538 --> 03:59.473
and awarded Greg
weekly supervised visits.

03:59.507 --> 04:00.908
How screwed-up
is that?

04:00.941 --> 04:02.510
Family court often approves

04:02.543 --> 04:04.378
supervised meetings
because it's therapeutic.

04:04.412 --> 04:06.314
For who? Huh?

04:06.347 --> 04:08.682
Not for my sons.

04:08.716 --> 04:09.817
Teddy was a happy,
loving child

04:09.850 --> 04:12.420
until his sick father
stuck his hand down his pants.

04:12.453 --> 04:13.621
He ruined Teddy's life.

04:13.654 --> 04:16.390
And now
he's gonna destroy Jake's.

04:16.424 --> 04:17.758
It doesn't have to be
that hopeless.

04:17.791 --> 04:20.328
Therapy could help Jake
cope with the trauma.

04:20.361 --> 04:23.397
Don't tell me therapy
is gonna save my little boy.

04:23.431 --> 04:26.500
It didn't help Teddy
seven years ago.

04:26.534 --> 04:27.668
I took him
to a shrink.

04:27.701 --> 04:28.669
They couldn't get him
to talk.

04:28.702 --> 04:31.038
So after a few weeks,

04:31.071 --> 04:31.905
we stopped going.

04:31.939 --> 04:33.941
What are you going to do
to protect Jake?

04:33.974 --> 04:35.709
The same thing I do
in every case like this--

04:35.743 --> 04:38.912
I'm gonna talk to the boys
and interview the ex-husband.

04:41.615 --> 04:42.716
Cool! You made it
to level 19!

04:42.750 --> 04:43.917
Shut up, butt brain.

04:43.951 --> 04:45.419
You're distracting me.

04:45.453 --> 04:46.954
Hi, Jake.

04:46.987 --> 04:49.323
Jake, my name
is George.

04:49.357 --> 04:50.891
We're gonna go talk downstairs
for a minute.

04:50.924 --> 04:53.661
Okay.

04:55.696 --> 04:56.697
Would you like
another soda?

04:56.730 --> 04:58.298
No, I'm good.

05:01.769 --> 05:03.771
Just talked
with your mom.

05:03.804 --> 05:05.339
So?

05:08.041 --> 05:09.677
She told me what your dad
did to you.

05:09.710 --> 05:11.078
It's no big deal.

05:11.111 --> 05:14.715
I think it is.

05:14.748 --> 05:16.016
And if he hurt
your little brother,

05:16.049 --> 05:17.351
it's a big deal
all over again.

05:17.385 --> 05:18.786
Whatever.

05:21.689 --> 05:22.723
What're you playing?

05:22.756 --> 05:23.857
It's called
a video game.

05:23.891 --> 05:25.393
You're not very smart,
are you?

05:25.426 --> 05:27.761
I have my moments.

05:32.700 --> 05:34.368
Does it bother you when Jake
visits your dad?

05:34.402 --> 05:35.969
Nope.

05:36.003 --> 05:37.571
I'd understand
if it did.

05:40.441 --> 05:43.377
Look, man. I've never gonna see
that ass wipe again.

05:43.411 --> 05:45.679
If Jake still wants to see him,
that's his business.

05:45.713 --> 05:48.115
If your father
molests him?

05:48.148 --> 05:50.150
That's not my problem.

05:50.183 --> 05:51.385
You're his big brother.

05:51.419 --> 05:52.820
That's right.

05:52.853 --> 05:55.088
That means I'm supposed to care,
doesn't it?

05:55.122 --> 05:59.393
That's right.
That's what that means.

06:01.529 --> 06:03.897
Tell me
what you know.

06:03.931 --> 06:05.399
I don't know anything.

06:05.433 --> 06:08.902
Why don't you ask him?

06:08.936 --> 06:10.170
What did you do
with your dad yesterday?

06:10.203 --> 06:11.405
Watched a movie.

06:11.439 --> 06:13.040
In a movie theatre?

06:13.073 --> 06:14.675
No, on TV.

06:17.010 --> 06:18.946
Did you do
anything else?

06:18.979 --> 06:20.047
Played a game.

06:20.080 --> 06:22.883
What game?

06:22.916 --> 06:24.718
Clue.

06:24.752 --> 06:27.855
That's the game that
you have to figure out

06:27.888 --> 06:29.423
who the bad guy is, right?

06:29.457 --> 06:33.494
It was Colonel Mustard
with the rope in the library.

06:33.527 --> 06:34.562
You know,
that's what I do.

06:34.595 --> 06:36.430
I catch the bad guys.

06:36.464 --> 06:37.965
Do you know any?

06:37.998 --> 06:40.067
Not in real life.

06:40.100 --> 06:41.134
What else do you do
with your dad?

06:41.168 --> 06:42.736
Play catch and stuff.

06:42.770 --> 06:44.972
He's afraid
to talk about it.

06:45.005 --> 06:46.206
Now what?

06:46.239 --> 06:48.509
We're gonna need to run
a rape kit.

06:48.542 --> 06:49.777
Yeah, I remember.

06:49.810 --> 06:51.679
The tests. The reports.

06:51.712 --> 06:54.648
I thought this was all
behind us.

06:54.682 --> 06:55.783
[door opening]

06:55.816 --> 06:56.884
Did Teddy say anything?

06:56.917 --> 06:59.920
Well, he's a tough nut
to crack.

06:59.953 --> 07:02.022
Yeah, I told you.

07:02.055 --> 07:03.190
He still won't even
talk to me.

07:03.223 --> 07:05.459
He'd rather lock himself
in his room

07:05.493 --> 07:06.627
and play those damn
computer games.

07:06.660 --> 07:08.195
He won't even eat
at the--

07:08.228 --> 07:09.897
at the table
with us.

07:09.930 --> 07:12.533
I--I can't go
through this again.

07:12.566 --> 07:13.767
We're gonna
help you out now.

07:13.801 --> 07:16.003
Breathe, breathe.

07:16.036 --> 07:18.105
Dr. Wong's gonna take you
to the hospital

07:18.138 --> 07:20.508
for Jake's exam.

07:20.541 --> 07:22.943
We're gonna talk
to your ex-husband.

07:22.976 --> 07:25.112
Okay?

07:30.283 --> 07:32.586
Hensal's enrolled
in a special pilot program.

07:32.620 --> 07:35.523
Registered sex offenders meet
regularly with a parole officer,

07:35.556 --> 07:37.157
a psyche counselor,
and a polygraph examiner.

07:37.190 --> 07:38.091
You think it works?

07:38.125 --> 07:39.993
Who the hell knows
with these dirt bags.

07:40.027 --> 07:43.631
Did you supervise
his visits with Jake?

07:43.664 --> 07:44.898
No, his sister does.

07:44.932 --> 07:46.567
He lives here with her.

07:49.302 --> 07:50.303
Mr. Barrett.

07:50.337 --> 07:52.740
I didn't think Greg
had an appointment today.

07:52.773 --> 07:55.175
Unscheduled visit.

07:55.208 --> 07:56.276
Greg!

07:56.309 --> 07:58.278
Your parole officer's here.

07:58.311 --> 07:59.913
Have you been giving
your brother

07:59.947 --> 08:00.981
time alone with Jake?

08:01.014 --> 08:02.249
Absolutely not.

08:02.282 --> 08:03.517
I know the rules.

08:03.551 --> 08:06.053
Hello, Officer Barrett.

08:06.086 --> 08:07.154
You brought back-up.

08:07.187 --> 08:08.889
I don't remember
robbing a bank.

08:08.922 --> 08:11.024
I'm Detective Stabler,
Special Victims.

08:11.058 --> 08:12.826
Let's you and I talk
in there.

08:16.129 --> 08:17.698
You saw your son
Jake yesterday.

08:17.731 --> 08:18.699
Yes.

08:18.732 --> 08:20.534
Were you alone
with him?

08:20.568 --> 08:21.635
No.

08:21.669 --> 08:23.003
Why?

08:23.036 --> 08:26.306
He says
he was abused.

08:26.339 --> 08:28.208
Well he--it wasn't me.

08:28.241 --> 08:30.277
I would never touch
my son.

08:30.310 --> 08:32.746
Well your rap sheet
says differently.

08:32.780 --> 08:33.781
I've changed.

08:33.814 --> 08:35.315
Why should
I believe that?

08:35.348 --> 08:37.284
The judge did.

08:37.317 --> 08:38.586
You think he'd let me
see my son

08:38.619 --> 08:39.987
if I wasn't cured?

08:40.020 --> 08:41.154
Probably wouldn't be
the first judge to get snowed

08:41.188 --> 08:42.723
by a pedophile
looking to get over.

08:42.756 --> 08:43.824
I did my time.

08:43.857 --> 08:46.226
I learned my lesson.

08:46.259 --> 08:47.961
I'm a grown man who lives
with his sister.

08:47.995 --> 08:50.230
I'm not allowed to be alone
with my own kid.

08:50.263 --> 08:52.032
That's my life
on parole.

08:52.065 --> 08:53.233
You think I'm gonna
take risks?

08:53.266 --> 08:54.702
If you think you can
get away with it, yeah.

08:54.735 --> 08:55.603
I can't get away
with anything.

08:55.636 --> 08:57.705
I take a lie detector test
every week.

09:00.040 --> 09:02.743
When's your
next appointment?

09:02.776 --> 09:03.777
Monday.

09:03.811 --> 09:05.779
Just got rescheduled.

09:09.182 --> 09:10.183
Is your name
Gregory Hensal?

09:10.217 --> 09:11.685
Yes.

09:15.689 --> 09:16.690
Are you
47 years old?

09:16.724 --> 09:18.025
Yes.

09:21.662 --> 09:23.597
Did you molest
your son Teddy?

09:23.631 --> 09:26.800
Yes, eight years ago.

09:26.834 --> 09:29.670
We've got our baseline.

09:29.703 --> 09:31.672
Have you ever touched
Jake's genitals?

09:31.705 --> 09:33.206
No.

09:38.411 --> 09:40.380
Has Jake ever touched
your genitals?

09:40.413 --> 09:42.182
No.

09:42.215 --> 09:44.117
Machine says
he's telling the truth.

09:44.151 --> 09:46.620
Guy takes a poly
once a week,

09:46.654 --> 09:48.689
practices enough,
he can beat the box.

09:48.722 --> 09:49.723
Were you alone

09:49.757 --> 09:52.225
with your son
Jake yesterday?

09:52.259 --> 09:54.594
No.

10:04.404 --> 10:07.074
Guess he needs
more practice.

10:13.914 --> 10:15.148
So you lied to us.

10:15.182 --> 10:16.817
No, I didn't.

10:16.850 --> 10:18.185
Polygraph says you did.

10:18.218 --> 10:20.153
You left Jake alone
with his father?

10:20.187 --> 10:21.755
It's wrong.
I gotta leave.

10:21.789 --> 10:23.090
I'm gonna miss
my shift.

10:23.123 --> 10:24.725
Lady, you're gonna miss life
in the free world

10:24.758 --> 10:26.860
when I charge you
as a co-conspirator.

10:26.894 --> 10:29.763
Talk.

10:34.234 --> 10:37.404
I had to take a shower
before work.

10:37.437 --> 10:40.941
I only left him alone
for 10 minutes.

10:40.974 --> 10:44.077
What can happen
in 10 minutes?

10:44.111 --> 10:45.212
Your sister
gave you up.

10:45.245 --> 10:46.680
You were alone
with Jake, right?

10:46.714 --> 10:48.048
All right, but I never
touched him.

10:48.081 --> 10:49.216
Well Jake is eight.

10:49.249 --> 10:50.684
Same age as Teddy
when you molested him.

10:50.718 --> 10:51.852
That's your type.

10:51.885 --> 10:53.420
I swear to you,
I didn't do anything wrong.

10:53.453 --> 10:56.790
The lie detector
proves it.

10:56.824 --> 10:57.791
You manipulate kids,
you can manipulate that machine.

10:57.825 --> 10:58.892
You're making
a mistake.

10:58.926 --> 11:00.994
I never hurt Jake.

11:01.028 --> 11:02.796
So he got the idea
to rub weenies all on his own?

11:02.830 --> 11:03.496
I don't think so.

11:03.530 --> 11:05.065
Did Jake say
I touched him?

11:05.098 --> 11:07.701
[cell phone]
No, he didn't, did he?

11:07.735 --> 11:08.836
He would never
say that.

11:08.869 --> 11:10.237
Threaten to kill him

11:10.270 --> 11:11.805
or you told him he'd never see
his mommy again?

11:11.839 --> 11:13.006
Usually works for while.

11:13.040 --> 11:14.775
Stabler.

11:14.808 --> 11:15.675
Please, you have
to believe me!

11:15.709 --> 11:17.144
We don't have to do
a damn thing for you.

11:17.177 --> 11:19.046
Warner needs us.

11:22.149 --> 11:23.851
The rape kit results
just came in.

11:23.884 --> 11:25.719
Got traces of saliva

11:25.753 --> 11:28.155
from the area surrounding
Jake's genitals.

11:28.188 --> 11:30.791
Just tell us we could put
his father away for good.

11:30.824 --> 11:32.092
Can't tell you that.

11:32.125 --> 11:34.194
But I will tell you we can
keep it in the family.

11:34.227 --> 11:37.798
This is Jake's
mitochondrial DNA.

11:38.866 --> 11:40.100
This is his abuser's.

11:43.436 --> 11:46.006
It's an exact match.

11:46.039 --> 11:50.443
Jake and his molester have
identical mitochondrial DNA.

11:50.477 --> 11:53.947
The mother passes that on
to the children.

11:53.981 --> 11:55.949
That means Teddy abused
his little brother.

11:55.983 --> 11:58.819
Like father, like son.

12:03.390 --> 12:05.793
Soccer coach said Teddy
showed up for practice.

12:05.826 --> 12:07.961
A kid said something and Teddy
took off like a shot.

12:07.995 --> 12:09.963
He's not at home.

12:09.997 --> 12:11.865
Mom hasn't seen him
since this morning.

12:18.571 --> 12:21.875
What the hell is this?

12:21.909 --> 12:23.510
It's shots
of Teddy Winnock.

12:23.543 --> 12:27.247
Like we've
never seen him before.

12:27.280 --> 12:29.416
Some of these
are hard core.

12:29.449 --> 12:31.785
Check this out.

12:31.819 --> 12:35.088
Teddy and his
little brother.

12:35.122 --> 12:36.156
Somebody must have heard
about what Teddy did

12:36.189 --> 12:37.557
and doctored up
some evidence.

12:37.590 --> 12:40.994
[children yelling]

12:41.028 --> 12:42.796
Break this freak's nose!
Come on!

12:42.830 --> 12:44.131
Kill him!
Kill him!

12:44.164 --> 12:45.165
Get him in the stomach!

12:45.198 --> 12:46.266
Do something!

12:46.299 --> 12:47.267
Kill this freak.
Hey--

12:47.300 --> 12:48.368
Come on!
That's enough.

12:48.401 --> 12:49.302
That's enough.
Come here.

12:51.905 --> 12:54.574
All you wrestlemaniacs
get out of here now.

12:54.607 --> 12:55.809
What's going on here?
Gordy did it!

12:55.843 --> 12:56.844
He hung those pictures!

12:56.877 --> 12:58.045
Up yours, fairy boy.

12:58.078 --> 12:59.312
I'll kill you!
Settle down.

12:59.346 --> 13:00.380
We're gonna talk.
Come here.

13:00.413 --> 13:01.815
Come here.

13:08.956 --> 13:10.557
That's some gut shot
you laid on that kid.

13:14.161 --> 13:15.362
Pictures must have
embarrassed you.

13:15.395 --> 13:16.897
You think?

13:16.930 --> 13:19.833
Why'd Gordy do it?

13:19.867 --> 13:20.868
I don't know.

13:23.270 --> 13:25.906
You have no idea why he'd want
to humiliate you.

13:29.176 --> 13:32.179
You know, if you don't talk,
I can't help.

13:33.180 --> 13:34.314
You wouldn't understand.

13:34.347 --> 13:35.949
Try me.

13:37.885 --> 13:40.888
Why are you
so interested in me?

13:40.921 --> 13:43.056
Those pictures
turn you on?

13:43.090 --> 13:46.526
The ones with your
little brother made me sick.

13:46.559 --> 13:47.627
Shut up.

13:47.660 --> 13:49.162
Did you screw around
with someone here

13:49.196 --> 13:50.931
like you did with Jake?

13:50.964 --> 13:52.365
'Cause the rape kit proves
you abused your little brother.

13:52.399 --> 13:54.968
No!

13:55.002 --> 13:55.969
No, I didn't hurt Jake.

13:56.003 --> 13:57.537
You molested him.

13:57.570 --> 13:59.139
So?

13:59.172 --> 14:02.142
My dad did stuff
to me.

14:02.175 --> 14:04.577
Didn't mess me up.

14:04.611 --> 14:07.480
Your dad screwed up
your head so bad

14:07.514 --> 14:09.849
you don't even know
what you've done.

14:14.021 --> 14:15.956
Come on.

14:15.989 --> 14:17.390
Hanging those pictures
is not a crime.

14:17.424 --> 14:18.558
I know my rights.

14:18.591 --> 14:20.160
I'm in journalism.
You're in puberty.

14:20.193 --> 14:21.561
Freedom of speech

14:21.594 --> 14:22.896
is the essence of democracy
in America.

14:22.930 --> 14:23.663
Oh, that's deep.

14:23.696 --> 14:25.999
Why'd you wallpaper
the hallway?

14:26.033 --> 14:27.500
'Cause Teddy's a freak
and everyone needs to know it.

14:27.534 --> 14:29.937
What, did he touch you?

14:29.970 --> 14:31.604
Dude, I'm not a fag.

14:31.638 --> 14:33.006
How'd you find out
about our investigation?

14:33.040 --> 14:34.341
What investigation?

14:34.374 --> 14:36.443
Is Teddy Winnock a suspect
in a crime, Detective?

14:36.476 --> 14:37.310
Gimme that.

14:37.344 --> 14:38.912
Fine, but the press
cannot be silenced.

14:38.946 --> 14:40.180
Why'd you make
these pictures?

14:40.213 --> 14:41.248
Make them?

14:41.281 --> 14:42.382
I found them.

14:42.415 --> 14:43.917
All this layout equipment,
you tell me

14:43.951 --> 14:45.018
you didn't Photoshop these?

14:45.052 --> 14:46.486
I couldn't dream up some of
the sick crap I saw there.

14:46.519 --> 14:47.654
Where?

14:47.687 --> 14:48.922
On the web.

14:48.956 --> 14:50.390
I followed a random link

14:50.423 --> 14:52.692
that got posted on Teddy's
Mysight page profile.

14:52.725 --> 14:53.693
Led me to his website and...

14:53.726 --> 14:55.595
freaky, freaky stuff, man.

14:55.628 --> 14:58.165
What site is that?

14:58.198 --> 15:01.368
Teddy's tree house dot com.

15:01.401 --> 15:04.371
All the photos from the school
came from this website.

15:04.404 --> 15:06.406
It's a child
porn superstore

15:06.439 --> 15:08.976
selling pictures and webcam
videos starring Teddy.

15:09.009 --> 15:10.944
And co-starring
his little brother.

15:10.978 --> 15:11.878
Well, who's running
the site?

15:11.911 --> 15:14.347
According to billing records,
Teddy is.

15:14.381 --> 15:16.950
How can a kid
run a business like this?

15:16.984 --> 15:19.719
All the money was deposited into
Teddy's online account.

15:19.752 --> 15:21.254
Pervs put the money in,

15:21.288 --> 15:23.523
Teddy can spend it
anywhere on the Net.

15:23.556 --> 15:24.591
Cash never changes hands.

15:24.624 --> 15:25.692
A minor
shooting kiddy porn.

15:25.725 --> 15:28.028
That's a new one.

15:28.061 --> 15:30.230
All you need is a webcam.

15:30.263 --> 15:33.033
And you can make videos
or chat live online.

15:33.066 --> 15:34.034
Smile.

15:34.067 --> 15:37.204
Yeah, well, Teddy did a lot more
than just chat.

15:37.237 --> 15:38.638
Well, that's right.

15:38.671 --> 15:42.009
He'd schedule times to appear
online for a live show.

15:42.042 --> 15:44.077
The webcam was a window
into his bedroom.

15:44.111 --> 15:46.046
And his pedophile subscribers

15:46.079 --> 15:48.015
paid for the privilege
of looking in.

15:48.048 --> 15:49.449
Subscribers?

15:49.482 --> 15:51.985
Creeps you pay to watch
and download Teddy's Tree house

15:52.019 --> 15:53.053
for 30 bucks a month.

15:53.086 --> 15:55.055
Times how many guys?

15:59.259 --> 16:01.528
Over a thousand.

16:05.098 --> 16:08.101
If Teddy Winnock
is doing this,

16:08.135 --> 16:09.736
how many other Teddys
are there?

16:09.769 --> 16:11.104
More than we know.

16:11.138 --> 16:12.372
These kids think
they're businessmen,

16:12.405 --> 16:13.473
when in reality, they're playing
right into pedophiles' hands.

16:13.506 --> 16:16.443
We used to think when kids
were at home they were safe.

16:16.476 --> 16:18.545
The web connects pedophiles
to each other.

16:18.578 --> 16:21.048
It gives them
easy access.

16:21.081 --> 16:23.216
One in five kids is
sexually solicited while online.

16:23.250 --> 16:24.751
Can we use the Internet
against these pervs

16:24.784 --> 16:27.087
to track down
Teddy's subscribers?

16:27.120 --> 16:28.021
No, I tried.
These guys are smart.

16:28.055 --> 16:29.789
They use offshore ISPs
that don't respond

16:29.822 --> 16:30.623
to our subpoenas.

16:30.657 --> 16:33.193
Get the kid
to give up some names.

16:33.226 --> 16:35.562
I'm gonna talk to
the little brother first.

16:35.595 --> 16:37.064
See if I can't get
any details

16:37.097 --> 16:39.299
to try and make Teddy
open up.

16:41.201 --> 16:43.136
Tell me about the pictures
you took with your brother.

16:43.170 --> 16:44.337
They're for his friends.

16:44.371 --> 16:45.738
Did you ever meet
these friends?

16:45.772 --> 16:46.739
No.

16:46.773 --> 16:50.277
They're on the computer.

16:50.310 --> 16:52.545
So Teddy took all
the pictures himself?

16:52.579 --> 16:54.481
And he made
the pretending movie.

16:54.514 --> 16:58.418
What's a pretending movie?

16:58.451 --> 17:00.353
Teddy's friends told us
to do stuff

17:00.387 --> 17:03.756
and we did it,
like acting in a movie.

17:03.790 --> 17:06.226
He said that they were
buying tickets to go see it.

17:08.228 --> 17:09.662
How many of these movies
did you do?

17:09.696 --> 17:10.730
One.

17:10.763 --> 17:11.831
Just one?

17:11.864 --> 17:14.167
He said we can
make more,

17:14.201 --> 17:15.635
but we've only done one
so far.

17:18.105 --> 17:19.339
Teddy abused his brother
in front of a camera

17:19.372 --> 17:20.607
for those perverts.

17:20.640 --> 17:22.742
Well, I don't want them
to watch any reruns.

17:22.775 --> 17:23.910
Shut down the website.

17:23.943 --> 17:26.813
What'd Teddy say when he first
told you about his friends?

17:26.846 --> 17:29.549
He said it was fun
to play pretend for them.

17:29.582 --> 17:31.684
Did you think
it was fun?

17:31.718 --> 17:32.585
I don't know.

17:32.619 --> 17:36.123
Did he say anything else
about his friends?

17:36.156 --> 17:37.724
If I did
what they wanted,

17:37.757 --> 17:40.227
they'd like me
and send him more presents.

17:40.260 --> 17:42.262
What kind of presents?

17:42.295 --> 17:44.664
Computer games
and comic books.

17:44.697 --> 17:47.300
And he said if I get
really good at pretending,

17:47.334 --> 17:49.702
they'll buy
me presents, too.

17:52.239 --> 17:54.107
Teddy's lawyer's here.

17:56.576 --> 17:58.445
Your brother told me
about the pretending movies.

17:58.478 --> 18:00.213
So?

18:00.247 --> 18:01.281
Those men
are using you.

18:01.314 --> 18:02.415
They pay me.

18:02.449 --> 18:04.317
It's my choice.

18:04.351 --> 18:06.119
Just like it was Jake's choice
to be molested by you?

18:06.153 --> 18:07.320
Go to hell.
Hey--

18:07.354 --> 18:08.521
Teddy, you calm down.

18:08.555 --> 18:09.722
Yeah, you may think
you're quite

18:09.756 --> 18:11.258
the little entrepreneur,
but you've committed

18:11.291 --> 18:12.492
some serious crimes
on your website.

18:12.525 --> 18:13.493
Would you
and the D.A.'s office

18:13.526 --> 18:15.295
consider a deal if Teddy names
his subscribers?

18:15.328 --> 18:16.296
No way.

18:16.329 --> 18:18.465
Those guys pay me
crazy loot.

18:18.498 --> 18:19.899
You think I'm gonna
give that up?

18:19.932 --> 18:21.501
You're gonna have to.
Why?

18:21.534 --> 18:22.702
It's my money.

18:22.735 --> 18:23.870
I earned it.

18:23.903 --> 18:25.472
It's obvious that Teddy
is the victim here.

18:25.505 --> 18:26.906
No, I'm not.

18:26.939 --> 18:28.208
He's being exploited.

18:28.241 --> 18:29.542
You arrest the men
who pay for this.

18:29.576 --> 18:30.577
They're the problem.

18:30.610 --> 18:32.279
He calls it a problem?

18:32.312 --> 18:34.447
I call it a business.

18:34.481 --> 18:37.550
Let's talk outside.

18:40.453 --> 18:45.858
Maybe after the arraignment
he'll realize this isn't a joke.

18:45.892 --> 18:47.694
If Teddy flips
on his customers,

18:47.727 --> 18:49.529
you can after hundreds
of real perps.

18:49.562 --> 18:50.863
You heard him.
He's not naming names.

18:50.897 --> 18:52.532
I just need
a little more time.

18:52.565 --> 18:53.600
Do you have
to arrest him today?

18:53.633 --> 18:54.634
You know the answer
to that.

18:54.667 --> 18:55.668
Well, wait--wait.

18:55.702 --> 18:56.703
You're arresting Teddy?

18:56.736 --> 18:57.870
I have to.

18:57.904 --> 18:58.871
He sexually abused
his little brother.

18:58.905 --> 19:00.440
He needs help, Detective.

19:00.473 --> 19:01.774
He's acting out
the abuse

19:01.808 --> 19:02.775
that he suffered
as a boy.

19:02.809 --> 19:04.177
I understand that.

19:04.211 --> 19:05.345
Let me talk to him.

19:05.378 --> 19:06.513
See if I can change
his mind.

19:06.546 --> 19:09.249
Send him home
for the night.

19:09.282 --> 19:10.850
My problem is I have
to consider Jake's safety.

19:10.883 --> 19:12.952
Jake will be safe.

19:12.985 --> 19:14.887
I'm sending him
to his grandmother.

19:14.921 --> 19:16.789
Just give me
a couple hours.

19:16.823 --> 19:18.291
If you send him
to jail tonight,

19:18.325 --> 19:18.991
he will shut down

19:19.025 --> 19:20.527
and we lose
that kid forever.

19:23.363 --> 19:25.932
Please, Detective.

19:25.965 --> 19:28.468
[clears throat]
Take your son home.

19:28.501 --> 19:30.303
I want him here 9:00
tomorrow morning

19:30.337 --> 19:31.738
ready to name names.

19:35.775 --> 19:36.809
Teddy.

19:36.843 --> 19:37.944
Go ahead.

19:37.977 --> 19:40.247
Come on.

19:46.286 --> 19:47.420
Thank you.

19:51.324 --> 19:52.392
It's a risky move, Elliot.

19:52.425 --> 19:54.261
I hope Langan can get Teddy
to flip on the pedophiles.

19:54.294 --> 19:57.230
Me, too. I'd rather bag
the predators than the prey.

19:58.331 --> 19:59.366
Detective Stabler.

19:59.399 --> 20:01.868
You saved me a trip.

20:01.901 --> 20:02.902
I was headed
to your squad next.

20:02.935 --> 20:05.305
Why? What're you
doing here, Donna?

20:05.338 --> 20:07.407
Putting you on notice that
the U.S. Attorney's Office

20:07.440 --> 20:08.875
is taking custody
of Teddy Winnock.

20:08.908 --> 20:11.244
For child pornography.

20:11.278 --> 20:13.746
He's a teenager
who was abused.

20:13.780 --> 20:14.981
That boy
is making child porn.

20:15.014 --> 20:17.417
Justice doesn't care
if he's 14 or 44.

20:17.450 --> 20:18.818
We've been building a case
against him

20:18.851 --> 20:20.820
for over a year now.

20:20.853 --> 20:22.322
And your guns step in
and rush our move.

20:22.355 --> 20:23.723
Excuse me?

20:23.756 --> 20:24.724
You heard what I said.

20:24.757 --> 20:26.025
When we got word
of the arrest,

20:26.058 --> 20:28.461
we voted out
the indictment this afternoon.

20:28.495 --> 20:29.729
Will you consider
a deal

20:29.762 --> 20:31.998
if Teddy flips
on his subscribers?

20:32.031 --> 20:33.500
They didn't make him
build that website.

20:33.533 --> 20:34.667
They paid for it.

20:34.701 --> 20:36.403
You want to lock up
one confused kid

20:36.436 --> 20:38.338
or a thousand guilty men?

20:40.707 --> 20:42.575
I came here
as a courtesy.

20:42.609 --> 20:43.943
You might show me
the same

20:43.976 --> 20:45.678
by not insulting
my intelligence.

20:45.712 --> 20:47.046
I know Teddy.
He's not a monster.

20:47.079 --> 20:48.014
He's a traumatized boy.

20:48.047 --> 20:50.049
He's a child pornographer.

20:50.082 --> 20:52.319
You know we have
a zero tolerance policy

20:52.352 --> 20:55.054
for online producers
of kiddy smut.

20:55.087 --> 20:55.855
There's a difference
between Teddy Winnock

20:55.888 --> 20:58.658
and a grown man
who exploits kids.

20:58.691 --> 21:00.327
He exploited
his little brother.

21:00.360 --> 21:02.495
He's a perp.

21:02.529 --> 21:04.030
Where is he?

21:04.063 --> 21:05.031
He's at his mother's house.

21:05.064 --> 21:06.933
He's surrendering
in the morning.

21:06.966 --> 21:08.401
We're not gonna wait
that long.

21:08.435 --> 21:09.502
If you don't want
to arrest Teddy,

21:09.536 --> 21:10.570
we'll do it for you.

21:10.603 --> 21:12.439
[dialing]

21:12.472 --> 21:13.473
Wait a minute.
I'll bring him in.

21:13.506 --> 21:17.344
I'll bring him in.

21:17.377 --> 21:20.313
I want Teddy Winnock
at my office in an hour.

21:23.049 --> 21:24.016
I talked to him.

21:24.050 --> 21:25.017
His lawyer talked to him.

21:25.051 --> 21:27.354
Teddy wouldn't reconsider.

21:27.387 --> 21:28.054
I'm sorry.

21:28.087 --> 21:32.392
Those men
poisoned his mind.

21:32.425 --> 21:34.561
[sighs]

21:34.594 --> 21:35.762
Teddy.

21:35.795 --> 21:37.730
What do you want?

21:37.764 --> 21:39.332
Detective Stabler's here.

21:43.570 --> 21:45.304
Teddy.

21:47.039 --> 21:48.908
Teddy, unlock this door!

21:48.941 --> 21:51.043
Teddy, come on out here.

21:55.848 --> 21:58.418
Teddy, what are
you doing?

22:32.419 --> 22:33.453
No sign of him.

22:33.486 --> 22:34.554
Units canvassed
the neighborhood.

22:34.587 --> 22:35.755
Teddy's in the wind.

22:35.788 --> 22:37.657
Airports and stations
are looking for him.

22:37.690 --> 22:38.725
He's not getting out
of the city.

22:38.758 --> 22:39.792
He will
if he has help.

22:39.826 --> 22:41.761
Printouts of recent
chat activity

22:41.794 --> 22:42.862
on the message board
at Teddy's Tree house.

22:42.895 --> 22:45.164
I've been monitoring it
all day.

22:45.197 --> 22:48.100
Look at the highlighted post
at the top of the first page.

22:48.134 --> 22:50.503
A user named
SunshineGuy9000 posted

22:50.537 --> 22:51.538
"Teddy at the nest.

22:51.571 --> 22:53.139
Help is on the way."

22:53.172 --> 22:54.140
The nest must be
his mother's house.

22:54.173 --> 22:55.141
Any leads on SunshineGuy?

22:55.174 --> 22:56.242
Not yet.

22:56.275 --> 22:58.177
Service providers are
still fighting our subpoena.

22:58.210 --> 22:59.412
Let me get
this straight--

22:59.446 --> 23:01.681
Teddy ran away
from home

23:01.714 --> 23:03.716
after pedophiles made plans
on his website

23:03.750 --> 23:04.917
to help him.

23:04.951 --> 23:06.185
Yes.

23:06.218 --> 23:07.687
A website I told you
to shut down.

23:07.720 --> 23:08.888
Captain--

23:08.921 --> 23:10.823
But you let these perverts
keep talking in that chat room

23:10.857 --> 23:12.492
after I gave you
a direct order

23:12.525 --> 23:13.693
to shut it down.

23:13.726 --> 23:16.563
The pedophiles--
Teddy is missing.

23:16.596 --> 23:18.197
Because you deliberately refused
to obey my order.

23:18.230 --> 23:21.668
The Feds are gonna want
somebody's head.

23:21.701 --> 23:23.570
Give me one reason
I shouldn't hand them yours.

23:23.603 --> 23:26.573
I've got a way
to make it right.

23:29.241 --> 23:31.110
Look at the post
right before SunshineGuy's.

23:34.614 --> 23:38.050
FunFella13 says,
"We've gotta help Teddy."

23:38.084 --> 23:39.686
SunshineGuy says,
"Help is on the way."

23:39.719 --> 23:41.721
They're working together.

23:41.754 --> 23:43.456
Is one of them
still online?

23:43.490 --> 23:44.824
SunshineGuy went dark
after the post,

23:44.857 --> 23:46.626
but FunFella's been all over
the web today,

23:46.659 --> 23:48.728
chit-chatting
on other teen sites.

23:48.761 --> 23:50.830
Let's use this.
We flirt with FunFella online.

23:50.863 --> 23:52.465
We set up a meet
and lure him out.

23:52.499 --> 23:53.533
Put him in the box.

23:53.566 --> 23:56.102
Sweat him for
an I.D. on Sunshine.

23:58.004 --> 23:59.706
Set it up.

24:03.142 --> 24:05.244
FunFella13 just entered
the Soccer Rulez chatroom.

24:05.277 --> 24:08.147
Okay, go in and post
as a 15 year-old boy.

24:08.180 --> 24:09.616
Hey, what's up?

24:09.649 --> 24:12.585
I'm Brad, 15, male, NYC.

24:12.619 --> 24:14.954
Sweeper on
the JV team.

24:16.989 --> 24:18.891
Should make contact
fairly soon.

24:18.925 --> 24:20.527
[computer tone]
Here we go.

24:20.560 --> 24:21.928
Just pinged me with a private
one-on-one instant message.

24:21.961 --> 24:23.596
Sweeper is
a hard position.

24:23.630 --> 24:25.798
I'm good at it though.

24:28.801 --> 24:31.504
Wants to know if you have
a girlfriend.

24:31.538 --> 24:32.739
Tell him
you don't like girls.

24:32.772 --> 24:35.241
Girls--yuck.

24:39.879 --> 24:41.047
Guy doesn't waste any time,
does he?

24:41.080 --> 24:42.615
All right, tell him
that you are a virgin,

24:42.649 --> 24:43.616
but, you know,
laugh it off.

24:43.650 --> 24:46.919
Laughing out loud. Yeah.

24:49.789 --> 24:52.224
Say you like
older guys,

24:52.258 --> 24:55.161
but you're afraid
it'll hurt.

25:01.167 --> 25:02.569
"I can
show you how

25:02.602 --> 25:06.305
so it doesn't hurt
and is great."

25:06.338 --> 25:08.575
Sicko thinks he's offering
to deflower a 15 year-old.

25:08.608 --> 25:10.610
Agree to it.

25:10.643 --> 25:12.278
Agree to it.

25:12.311 --> 25:14.647
Cool.

25:17.216 --> 25:19.819
Bait like that
he'll wanna meet.

25:19.852 --> 25:21.120
[computer tone]
"Let's hang out."

25:21.153 --> 25:23.790
(Stabler)
We got him.

25:25.725 --> 25:27.259
Fin, you in position?

25:27.293 --> 25:29.095
We're good to go.

25:29.128 --> 25:30.730
Ten-four.

25:33.666 --> 25:35.134
Hey, why'd you disobey
Cragen's order

25:35.167 --> 25:36.235
to shut down
Teddy's website?

25:36.268 --> 25:39.706
I shut it down, the pedophiles
just go somewhere else.

25:42.809 --> 25:44.176
So you risk
your career?

25:47.680 --> 25:49.015
I needed to get 'em.

25:51.884 --> 25:53.753
My sister's
a single mom.

25:53.786 --> 25:55.855
She works long hours.

25:55.888 --> 25:58.925
Her son Freddy is 12.

25:58.958 --> 26:00.126
Latchkey kid.

26:00.159 --> 26:03.630
Goes online
to make friends.

26:03.663 --> 26:07.834
A new buddy convinces him
to meet, go see a movie.

26:07.867 --> 26:10.369
Freddy goes.

26:10.402 --> 26:12.905
The guy's 43.

26:12.939 --> 26:15.207
Takes my nephew to a hotel
and rapes him.

26:16.976 --> 26:18.277
They find the guy?

26:18.310 --> 26:20.246
No.

26:24.416 --> 26:27.954
I gave Freddy
the computer.

26:33.793 --> 26:34.961
Look.

26:34.994 --> 26:38.130
Red jacket,
brown pants.

26:38.164 --> 26:39.632
Just what FunFella said
he'd be wearing.

26:39.666 --> 26:42.368
Fin, the target's
approaching you.

26:42.401 --> 26:45.371
White male, red jacket,
brown pants.

26:45.404 --> 26:46.873
Got it.

26:52.745 --> 26:53.746
Hey, FunFella.

26:53.780 --> 26:55.181
Who are you?

26:55.214 --> 26:56.716
I'm your blind date
from the Internet.

26:56.749 --> 26:58.718
I'm a little older
than 15,

26:58.751 --> 26:59.852
but maybe we can
still be friends.

26:59.886 --> 27:01.854
I just came
to get something to eat.

27:01.888 --> 27:03.956
Yeah, right. And I'm starting
goalie for the Rangers.

27:03.990 --> 27:04.991
What's your name?

27:05.024 --> 27:06.058
Ralph Zessner.

27:06.092 --> 27:07.660
What's in
the bag, Ralphie?

27:07.694 --> 27:08.594
Nothing.

27:08.627 --> 27:11.163
Four-pack of coolers
and a box of condoms.

27:11.197 --> 27:13.399
What, you plan on getting frisky
with the Hamburglar?

27:13.432 --> 27:14.801
I don't know
what you're talking about.

27:14.834 --> 27:16.402
You know
where Teddy is.

27:16.435 --> 27:18.404
Who's Teddy?

27:18.437 --> 27:19.672
Don't test me, pal.

27:19.706 --> 27:20.807
You're not gonna like
the results.

27:20.840 --> 27:23.075
We got your membership payments
from Teddy's Tree house.

27:23.109 --> 27:25.044
And your chat log with
a 15 year-old boy named Brad.

27:25.077 --> 27:27.446
Who's actually a cop.

27:27.479 --> 27:28.781
Oh, God.

27:28.815 --> 27:29.782
It's all coming back
to you know, huh?

27:29.816 --> 27:32.084
I'm a horrible person.

27:32.118 --> 27:33.419
Yeah, I'm down with you
on that thought.

27:33.452 --> 27:34.721
I'm trying
to get better.

27:34.754 --> 27:35.755
I'm seeing a shrink.

27:35.788 --> 27:36.823
Seven days a week
on a couch

27:36.856 --> 27:38.224
is not gonna help
a guy like you.

27:38.257 --> 27:39.391
What do you do, Ralph?

27:39.425 --> 27:41.794
I'm a teacher.

27:41.828 --> 27:42.461
No child left behind?
Is that it?

27:42.494 --> 27:43.996
It was just fantasy.

27:44.030 --> 27:46.933
Yeah, then why'd you show up
with a box of condoms?

27:46.966 --> 27:49.135
I've never done this before,
I swear.

27:49.168 --> 27:52.104
Save that
for your cell mate.

27:52.138 --> 27:53.372
Who's SunshineGuy?

27:53.405 --> 27:54.941
I don't know.

27:54.974 --> 27:56.042
Yeah, you do.
You're working with him.

27:56.075 --> 27:57.810
Posted online
right before him.

27:57.844 --> 28:00.179
He answered you,
"Help is on the way."

28:00.212 --> 28:01.781
And you both helped Teddy run
away from his mother's house,

28:01.814 --> 28:04.751
which you sickos
call the nest.

28:04.784 --> 28:06.118
His mother's house
isn't the nest.

28:06.152 --> 28:07.920
Then what is?

28:07.954 --> 28:11.290
If I tell you where the nest is,
will you let me go?

28:11.323 --> 28:12.725
I'm not here
to bargain with you.

28:12.759 --> 28:14.493
How about if I send
the transcript

28:14.526 --> 28:16.262
of your web chat
to your family,

28:16.295 --> 28:20.867
your neighbors, the parents
of the kids you teach, huh?

28:20.900 --> 28:22.869
Teddy called it
the nest

28:22.902 --> 28:25.905
because the building's
named Eagle Plaza.

28:25.938 --> 28:28.741
It's where Teddy
films his shows.

28:28.775 --> 28:30.743
He was going there
to hide out.

28:34.847 --> 28:37.716
[jangling keys]

28:40.920 --> 28:42.254
Pizza boxes.

28:42.288 --> 28:43.823
Soda cans.

28:43.856 --> 28:45.091
Old comic books.

28:45.124 --> 28:47.126
High-tech gear.

28:47.159 --> 28:49.195
It's a teenage boy's
fantasy crash pad.

28:49.228 --> 28:53.800
Homemade kiddy porn studio.

28:53.833 --> 28:55.501
Wonder who tipped off Teddy
we were coming.

28:58.537 --> 29:00.339
Check out
his last show.

29:03.242 --> 29:07.246
Well, everybody, this could be
the last you see me for awhile.

29:07.279 --> 29:08.514
Things are getting
pretty annoying here,

29:08.547 --> 29:13.886
so I'm leaving town to stay
with some friends in Oregon.

29:13.920 --> 29:15.221
I'm doing one last
cam show.

29:15.254 --> 29:18.557
So let's have
some fun.

29:18.590 --> 29:20.559
Someone's coming
to the tree house.

29:20.592 --> 29:21.828
Oh, hi.
[keys jingle]

29:21.861 --> 29:24.263
Surprise visitor.

29:24.296 --> 29:25.331
What's going on?

29:25.364 --> 29:27.934
Could be
an extra fun show today.

29:27.967 --> 29:30.970
[struggling]

29:43.482 --> 29:45.084
Guy had his own key.
Let himself in.

29:45.117 --> 29:46.485
Teddy knows the kidnapper.

29:46.518 --> 29:49.956
He's too young to rent
this place on his own.

29:49.989 --> 29:51.891
Lease was signed
four months ago

29:51.924 --> 29:53.492
by a guy named
Claude Henderson.

29:53.525 --> 29:55.327
Weirdo.

29:55.361 --> 29:58.831
Prior address--
1234 Happytown Lane?

29:58.865 --> 30:01.333
You got any info on this guy
that's not a fairy tale?

30:01.367 --> 30:03.435
Well he pays the rent
with an out-of-state check.

30:03.469 --> 30:04.871
One just came in.

30:07.273 --> 30:11.043
Drawn on a bank
in Garfield, New Jersey.

30:11.077 --> 30:11.844
It's an hour away.

30:11.878 --> 30:13.145
It's plenty of time
to get in here,

30:13.179 --> 30:16.048
grab Teddy,
and go back home.

30:16.082 --> 30:17.216
Hey, how you doing?

30:17.249 --> 30:18.450
We're looking
for Claude Henderson.

30:18.484 --> 30:19.886
You found him.

30:19.919 --> 30:21.620
That's Claude Henderson?

30:21.653 --> 30:23.422
Yes, sir.

30:23.455 --> 30:24.924
Anyone else
live in the house?

30:24.957 --> 30:25.858
No, sir.

30:25.892 --> 30:27.126
Just me and Mr. Claude.

30:27.159 --> 30:28.594
Doesn't look like he's
running around

30:28.627 --> 30:29.862
abusing little boys.

30:29.896 --> 30:31.263
Doesn't look like
he can breathe,

30:31.297 --> 30:32.398
let alone write
a check

30:32.431 --> 30:33.632
or rent a pad.

30:33.665 --> 30:37.203
Mr. Claude's been having all
sorts of trouble with the bank.

30:37.236 --> 30:39.638
They said someone stole
his identity.

30:39.671 --> 30:41.941
What now?

30:59.025 --> 31:00.993
What are you
doing here?

31:01.027 --> 31:03.629
We need your help.

31:08.667 --> 31:10.202
Morales couldn't track
these pedophiles.

31:10.236 --> 31:11.203
He doesn't have
the software.

31:11.237 --> 31:13.005
And you do?
Cutting edge.

31:13.039 --> 31:14.406
Hot off the press
from Homeland Security.

31:14.440 --> 31:17.009
Why doesn't every squad
get that?

31:17.043 --> 31:18.077
'Cause not every squad
that's fighting terrorists,

31:18.110 --> 31:19.578
who are going digital.

31:19.611 --> 31:21.580
Traces that used to take
an entire day

31:21.613 --> 31:22.915
now take 20 minutes.

31:22.949 --> 31:23.815
You're really into this.

31:23.849 --> 31:25.517
Computer scams.
Credit card frauds.

31:25.551 --> 31:27.486
I haven't seen blood or tears
in weeks.

31:27.519 --> 31:29.255
And you guys'll
benefit too.

31:29.288 --> 31:31.323
These programs
will change the way

31:31.357 --> 31:32.925
sexual predators
are hunted online.

31:32.959 --> 31:34.293
At least we can win
one war on terror.

31:34.326 --> 31:35.461
Take a look
at this.

31:35.494 --> 31:37.997
SunshineGuy posted
"Help is on the way"

31:38.030 --> 31:40.066
from a computer
at an encrypted IP address.

31:40.099 --> 31:43.102
Now this window is tracking
SunshineGuy's web activity...

31:43.135 --> 31:44.971
in real time.

31:45.004 --> 31:46.672
How will that lead us
to him?

31:46.705 --> 31:47.906
Well the next time he chats,
sends an email,

31:47.940 --> 31:51.043
or visits a web page, I can pull
up the encrypted IP address

31:51.077 --> 31:52.411
and trace it back
through the network

31:52.444 --> 31:54.446
and find
his exact location.

31:54.480 --> 31:55.481
Here we go.

31:55.514 --> 31:56.548
He's online again.

31:59.118 --> 32:01.053
Just a second now.

32:01.087 --> 32:02.388
Done.

32:02.421 --> 32:06.492
IP address routes from
an office at Mercy Hospital.

32:06.525 --> 32:07.526
First a teacher.

32:07.559 --> 32:08.527
Then a doctor.

32:08.560 --> 32:10.963
What are we gonna find next,
the vice president?

32:15.634 --> 32:16.635
See ya.

32:16.668 --> 32:18.670
Okay.

32:23.675 --> 32:25.077
Tell your mother
I'm listening to your heart.

32:25.111 --> 32:26.745
[in Spanish]

32:26.778 --> 32:29.015
You know, doc,
you should listen to this.

32:29.048 --> 32:30.249
Who are you?

32:30.282 --> 32:32.084
Who are you?
I'm Dr. Lucas.

32:32.118 --> 32:34.186
I'll just
call you SunshineGuy.

32:34.220 --> 32:35.521
Where's Teddy Winnock?

32:35.554 --> 32:37.189
I don't know
what you're talking about.

32:37.223 --> 32:39.191
Then come to the precinct
and we'll jog your memory.

32:39.225 --> 32:41.160
This is a mistake.
I'll be back soon.

32:41.193 --> 32:42.995
Don't bet on it.
I will.

32:43.029 --> 32:45.564
Teddy's gone,
and you'll never find him.

32:45.597 --> 32:48.500
You help us find Teddy, we help
you avoid a life sentence.

32:48.534 --> 32:49.601
Why should I help you?

32:49.635 --> 32:53.239
You want to put Teddy
in jail.

32:53.272 --> 32:54.440
Where is he?

32:54.473 --> 32:55.607
I don't know.
You're a liar.

32:55.641 --> 32:56.742
You posted
"Help is on the way."

32:56.775 --> 32:58.344
I was at the hospital
all day.

32:58.377 --> 32:59.511
You can check.

32:59.545 --> 33:01.413
Then who'd you send?

33:04.816 --> 33:08.387
You've got one chance
to save this boy's life

33:08.420 --> 33:09.755
and your own ass.

33:13.659 --> 33:16.495
It's obvious
you don't care about Teddy.

33:16.528 --> 33:18.130
We do.

33:19.631 --> 33:21.433
I'm not saying
another word.

33:26.205 --> 33:28.174
Lucas has deluded himself
into thinking

33:28.207 --> 33:29.775
he's protecting Teddy.

33:29.808 --> 33:31.777
Have you found
any of the other subscribers?

33:31.810 --> 33:32.811
I have spent hours online.

33:32.844 --> 33:35.314
They're hiding in all kinds
of corners in the web.

33:35.347 --> 33:37.116
They pop up in chat rooms
from time to time,

33:37.149 --> 33:38.784
but it's impossible
to monitor them all.

33:38.817 --> 33:41.053
No one's mentioning Teddy.

33:41.087 --> 33:42.121
Ruben, look--

33:42.154 --> 33:43.789
You've done
a great job.

33:43.822 --> 33:46.158
Tracking Teddy is a gig
for Computer Crimes, not TARU.

33:46.192 --> 33:47.159
I know, but if I--
Listen to me.

33:47.193 --> 33:48.694
Listen to me.

33:48.727 --> 33:49.828
You've gone as far
as you can.

33:49.861 --> 33:51.330
Go home
and get sleep.

33:53.432 --> 33:54.466
Go home.

33:54.500 --> 33:56.102
We'll find him.

33:57.136 --> 33:59.105
It's probably too late.

33:59.138 --> 34:01.140
Teddy's dead,
and it's my fault.

34:02.408 --> 34:06.178
[phone ringing]

34:06.212 --> 34:07.346
Stabler.

34:10.516 --> 34:12.318
I'll be right over.

34:12.351 --> 34:15.187
Pulled Dr. Lucas'
cell phone records.

34:15.221 --> 34:17.623
Here's a log of all his calls
and text messages.

34:17.656 --> 34:19.391
Without a warrant?

34:19.425 --> 34:21.393
Well, I didn't think
you'd want me to wait.

34:21.427 --> 34:22.794
What'd you get?

34:22.828 --> 34:25.097
Lucas sent a text message
yesterday morning at 9:15

34:25.131 --> 34:27.633
to somebody with
a screen name GoodFriend22--

34:27.666 --> 34:29.835
Meet me at Mercy Hospital
Cafeteria at 1:30.

34:29.868 --> 34:31.503
Who's this GoodFriend22?

34:31.537 --> 34:33.339
Another subscriber
to Teddy's website.

34:33.372 --> 34:35.141
Text message
was also sent

34:35.174 --> 34:37.109
through a disposable
cell phone.

34:37.143 --> 34:38.177
Uh, that's another
dead end.

34:38.210 --> 34:39.411
It's something.

34:39.445 --> 34:41.680
Look, Dr. Lucas met GoodFriend
face to face.

34:41.713 --> 34:44.216
Go back to Lucas and get me
GoodFriend's email address,

34:44.250 --> 34:45.851
other screen names--

34:45.884 --> 34:48.120
My problem is Dr. Lucas
isn't talking to us.

34:48.154 --> 34:49.188
At all.

34:51.290 --> 34:53.192
Look, you know
what you need.

34:53.225 --> 34:56.495
You want to take
a crack at him?

35:03.535 --> 35:06.205
I wasn't planning
on coming back.

35:06.238 --> 35:06.872
It's in your blood.

35:06.905 --> 35:09.175
That's the problem.

35:09.208 --> 35:12.211
[fight sounds]

35:13.679 --> 35:15.681
Where's Teddy?

35:15.714 --> 35:16.682
Where the hell
is Teddy?

35:16.715 --> 35:18.884
Wait.
Until Morales kills him?

35:22.188 --> 35:23.189
Enough.

35:23.222 --> 35:24.156
Enough!

35:24.190 --> 35:26.192
Hey, get out of here.
Olivia, I can explain.

35:26.225 --> 35:27.159
I don't want to hear it.
Get out.

35:27.193 --> 35:28.327
Are you gonna
turn me in?

35:28.360 --> 35:29.361
If I don't, he will.

35:29.395 --> 35:30.429
Go.

35:33.365 --> 35:35.801
Who's GoodFriend22?

35:41.773 --> 35:44.243
Huh?

35:44.276 --> 35:45.744
Who's GoodFriend22?

35:45.777 --> 35:47.746
You gonna beat me
if I won't talk?

35:47.779 --> 35:48.780
Tell me about
the kidnapping.

35:48.814 --> 35:49.781
Stop calling it that.

35:49.815 --> 35:50.816
It wasn't a kidnapping.

35:50.849 --> 35:53.619
Teddy went into hiding.

35:53.652 --> 35:55.921
Voluntarily.

35:55.954 --> 35:57.423
Voluntarily?

35:57.456 --> 35:59.791
Wrong.

35:59.825 --> 36:04.463
Does that look voluntary
to you?

36:09.968 --> 36:13.972
We wanted to protect him.

36:14.005 --> 36:16.242
I, uh...

36:16.275 --> 36:18.244
I love him.

36:18.277 --> 36:20.279
Kidnapping is a funny way
to show it.

36:20.312 --> 36:21.313
Who's the man
in the video?

36:21.347 --> 36:22.781
I don't know.

36:22.814 --> 36:24.316
If you want
to protect him,

36:24.350 --> 36:26.485
then tell us
who that man is.

36:26.518 --> 36:27.519
He doesn't love Teddy

36:27.553 --> 36:28.554
the way you do.

36:28.587 --> 36:30.522
I--I can't.

36:30.556 --> 36:32.224
Think of that boy
that you love.

36:32.258 --> 36:34.460
Think of his body--

36:34.493 --> 36:37.829
that young, thin,
perfect body.

36:37.863 --> 36:41.233
Now picture it bruised
and broken

36:41.267 --> 36:42.234
and covered with blood.

36:42.268 --> 36:43.302
Is that
what you want?

36:43.335 --> 36:44.736
Because, Lucas...

36:44.770 --> 36:48.006
if he dies,
this is gonna be on you.

36:48.039 --> 36:50.642
I don't believe you.

36:50.676 --> 36:52.244
We all love Teddy.

36:52.278 --> 36:54.313
None of us
would harm him.

36:54.346 --> 36:55.847
That tape is a fake.

37:04.323 --> 37:05.657
I guess he's not gonna
fall for it.

37:05.691 --> 37:07.693
I told you
he was sharp.

37:11.530 --> 37:13.031
You're free to go.

37:13.064 --> 37:15.267
What? Just like that?

37:15.301 --> 37:16.368
We've got nothing
to hold you on.

37:16.402 --> 37:17.703
Come on.

37:40.792 --> 37:42.661
It's just like
you thought, Liv.

37:42.694 --> 37:43.729
Lucas couldn't resist.

37:43.762 --> 37:46.031
He went straight
to an Internet cafe.

37:49.835 --> 37:52.871
It looks like
he's logging on right now.

37:52.904 --> 37:54.373
He is. I'm pulling up
his account.

37:56.442 --> 37:57.709
Okay, I'm in.

37:57.743 --> 37:59.745
I've got his activity
mirrored in real time.

37:59.778 --> 38:03.014
I can see everything
that he's doing.

38:03.048 --> 38:06.051
Just opened an IM chat window
with GoodFriend22.

38:06.084 --> 38:08.854
He wants to know
if Teddy's okay.

38:08.887 --> 38:10.756
You have a location
on GoodFriend?

38:10.789 --> 38:12.524
Just one second.
They're chatting now.

38:12.558 --> 38:16.362
GoodFriend's message says
"Teddy will be quiet.

38:16.395 --> 38:17.363
We are safe."

38:17.396 --> 38:19.465
IP address
is upper Manhattan.

38:22.133 --> 38:24.436
Router is
for Washington Heights.

38:24.470 --> 38:26.438
How long until
you have an address?

38:26.472 --> 38:27.806
Just hold on
one sec.

38:27.839 --> 38:29.007
I'm working on it.

38:36.147 --> 38:38.116
Got it.

38:38.149 --> 38:40.018
15 West 180th street.

38:43.455 --> 38:44.423
Police!

38:44.456 --> 38:46.792
Stay where you are.

38:46.825 --> 38:47.959
Find Teddy.

38:51.663 --> 38:54.666
[struggling]

39:25.997 --> 39:27.365
Teddy's not downstairs.

39:36.842 --> 39:39.411
Take that dirt bag
to the car.

39:48.554 --> 39:49.688
You're gonna be okay.

39:52.223 --> 39:54.025
[screaming]

39:57.095 --> 39:59.698
Listen to me.

39:59.731 --> 40:01.433
You're gonna be okay.

40:13.211 --> 40:14.212
You were right.

40:14.245 --> 40:16.748
About what?

40:21.252 --> 40:24.089
You said
they were using me.

40:24.122 --> 40:27.559
I thought those guys
were my friends.

40:27.593 --> 40:30.862
I thought
they loved me.

40:30.896 --> 40:31.897
They were my life.

40:31.930 --> 40:33.131
Now I'm alone.

40:33.164 --> 40:34.700
You have your family.

40:34.733 --> 40:36.868
They're the ones
who really love you.

40:36.902 --> 40:39.104
They'll never forgive me.

40:39.137 --> 40:41.039
They know what happened
isn't all your fault.

40:43.709 --> 40:45.176
I'm not sure
I believe you.

40:45.210 --> 40:47.613
Well, not yet, but...

40:47.646 --> 40:49.981
you will.

40:50.015 --> 40:50.982
Are you okay?

40:51.016 --> 40:54.185
No. No, I'm not.

40:54.219 --> 40:55.521
I'm sorry, mom.

40:55.554 --> 40:58.123
I know.

41:18.076 --> 41:20.245
[sighs]

41:20.278 --> 41:21.379
You got a lot of nerve
showing up here.

41:21.412 --> 41:26.552
Your conversation skills
are what I like best about you.

41:26.585 --> 41:27.485
So what are you
gonna do now,

41:27.519 --> 41:28.286
slap the cuffs
on him while he's asleep,

41:28.319 --> 41:29.788
maybe pull out
his IVs yourself?

41:29.821 --> 41:30.789
No.

41:30.822 --> 41:32.791
I'm going
to grant him immunity

41:32.824 --> 41:35.627
in exchange for his testimony
against the pedophiles.

41:35.661 --> 41:37.162
Good.

41:37.195 --> 41:38.196
No jail time.

41:38.229 --> 41:40.632
But he'll go to a residential
treatment facility.

41:40.666 --> 41:42.968
Teddy will get
the help he needs.

41:43.001 --> 41:46.037
Have a good day, Counselor.

41:49.608 --> 41:52.611
It was
a tough decision, Olivia.

41:52.644 --> 41:53.645
But you did
the right thing.

41:53.679 --> 41:55.681
Thank you, Captain.

41:59.150 --> 42:00.218
So you did it?

42:00.251 --> 42:02.588
I did.

42:02.621 --> 42:04.255
Why?

42:04.289 --> 42:06.124
I didn't have a choice.
There are always choices.

42:06.157 --> 42:07.593
Morales is a good man.

42:10.295 --> 42:11.797
You think
I ratted him out?

42:16.034 --> 42:18.536
No, no. I know that's not
your style.

42:20.772 --> 42:21.807
Thanks.

42:24.375 --> 42:25.911
What are
you doing here?

42:28.146 --> 42:29.948
I work here.

42:40.225 --> 42:40.291
