WEBVTT

00:02.526 --> 00:04.959
I like the people I work
with, but I've always believed

00:04.993 --> 00:07.030
it's important to
keep your personal life

00:07.064 --> 00:08.433
separate from your
work life. Otherwise...

00:08.699 --> 00:11.066
So did you have sex with
that girl last night?

00:11.100 --> 00:13.168
Gee, that's totally your business.

00:13.202 --> 00:16.137
- But I'm trying to keep my personal life
- much more accessible to all of us?

00:16.171 --> 00:19.175
- That's good because thats what makes work interesting.
- I think work makes work interesting.

00:19.210 --> 00:22.512
Oh, God. No wonder she
wouldn't have sex with you.

00:22.546 --> 00:25.214
That... that wasn't...

00:25.248 --> 00:27.181
I was the one...

00:27.216 --> 00:29.817
- We both felt...
- You shoulda shown her that flustered thing.

00:29.851 --> 00:31.418
It woulda totally sealed it.

00:31.452 --> 00:34.822
No, I... I wasn't... yeah, that.

00:36.323 --> 00:38.591
Good morning, Lem.

00:38.625 --> 00:40.091
Whoa.

00:40.126 --> 00:41.926
What's with the red lab coat?

00:41.961 --> 00:43.661
I don't know.

00:43.695 --> 00:45.595
When I went to my locker this morning,

00:45.630 --> 00:47.564
instead of a freshly
laundered white lab coat,

00:47.598 --> 00:50.134
which is what's been in
my locker every morning

00:50.169 --> 00:52.537
for the last 11 years, there was this.

00:52.571 --> 00:55.206
Are all our lab coats red?

00:55.240 --> 00:59.077
No. Mine is still white.

00:59.112 --> 01:02.447
Okay. I am not angry. I just
need to know what's happening.

01:02.482 --> 01:04.182
I don't know.

01:04.215 --> 01:06.918
Well, change doesn't always
have to be bad, right?

01:06.953 --> 01:10.088
Remember when I stopped
doing that finger gun thing?

01:10.123 --> 01:11.857
Everyone liked that.

01:11.891 --> 01:13.993
Oh, my God. It's true.

01:14.027 --> 01:15.928
It's even redder than I imagined.

01:15.962 --> 01:17.930
And I imagined it quite red.

01:17.964 --> 01:19.665
What does it mean?

01:19.699 --> 01:22.334
- We don't know.
- You're lying!

01:22.369 --> 01:24.203
I'm sorry. It's the coat.

01:24.238 --> 01:26.238
Its differentness is
making me say things.

01:26.273 --> 01:28.541
That's it. We need answers.

01:28.575 --> 01:31.544
I've spent my entire
life trying to blend in.

01:31.578 --> 01:35.315
When I shaved off my fu manchu,
I thought I was there. Now this?

01:35.349 --> 01:37.250
I miss that fu manchu.

01:37.284 --> 01:40.220
Talk about pizzazz.

01:40.255 --> 01:43.623
So the testing results
were inconclusive.

01:43.658 --> 01:46.059
Usually that's what people
say when something tests badly,

01:46.094 --> 01:47.928
and this is a good example of that.

01:47.962 --> 01:49.830
Turns out developing
cheese that never spoils

01:49.864 --> 01:51.798
is harder than we thought.

01:51.833 --> 01:53.833
Right now, it's more of
a cheddar-colored fabric

01:53.868 --> 01:56.002
that does spoil.

01:56.036 --> 01:57.870
So we need you to talk to Chet

01:57.905 --> 02:00.038
and get him to push the deadline.

02:03.876 --> 02:05.777
Are you purring?

02:07.780 --> 02:09.214
Or growling?

02:09.247 --> 02:12.050
Oh, man. Are you gonna start
growling now when you're mad?

02:12.085 --> 02:14.186
Because that's gonna
be hard to adjust to.

02:14.221 --> 02:16.055
Veronica?

02:19.626 --> 02:21.761
Veronica.

02:21.795 --> 02:24.430
What? What is so damn important?

02:24.465 --> 02:26.199
Uh, you fell asleep.

02:26.233 --> 02:28.667
Well, maybe you two are boring.
Did you ever think of that?

02:28.702 --> 02:32.004
Veronica has a very high-powered job.

02:32.039 --> 02:34.173
To blow off steam, she recently started

02:34.207 --> 02:36.041
a new, very exciting relationship

02:36.075 --> 02:38.510
with an extremely passionate
man with huge appetites

02:38.544 --> 02:40.011
named Mordor.

02:41.747 --> 02:44.215
He's also a world-class magician.

02:44.249 --> 02:46.217
Oh.

02:51.023 --> 02:52.490
Ahh.

02:52.524 --> 02:54.759
Unfortunately, this new relationship

02:54.793 --> 02:58.362
has made Veronica a
little distracted at work.

02:58.397 --> 03:00.531
Occupied.

03:03.135 --> 03:06.071
You know you're spreading
cream cheese on your iPhone?

03:06.105 --> 03:07.405
Oh.

03:07.440 --> 03:09.441
Then where's my bagel?

03:11.410 --> 03:13.578
The relationship is very intense.

03:13.612 --> 03:16.614
This weekend, Mordor and
I are going scuba diving.

03:16.649 --> 03:18.749
Last weekend, we raced
cars in the desert

03:18.784 --> 03:21.151
and ate a rattlesnake...

03:21.186 --> 03:23.153
And a go that wandered into our camp

03:23.188 --> 03:25.789
and then a light salad.

03:25.823 --> 03:29.727
But mostly, we have sex...
hours and hours of it.

03:29.761 --> 03:31.662
Last weekend, I helped my daughter

03:31.697 --> 03:33.631
build a house of Legos.

03:33.666 --> 03:36.134
I know I've been a
little distracted lately,

03:36.169 --> 03:37.669
but I'll be fine.

03:37.704 --> 03:39.604
I'm just living an
exciting and full life...

03:39.639 --> 03:41.573
burning the candle at both ends,

03:41.607 --> 03:43.842
the way my great-grandfather,
a misunderstood candle maker,

03:43.876 --> 03:45.711
insisted candles should be burned.

03:48.382 --> 03:51.283
Whenever I have sex, I have
to be alert the next day

03:51.318 --> 03:52.752
so I don't make mistakes.

03:52.786 --> 03:55.654
I have to be alert during
sex so I don't make mistakes.

03:55.689 --> 03:58.691
- Basically, I always have to be alert.
- Is it possible to make mistakes during sex,

03:58.725 --> 04:00.626
for a woman to make mistakes during sex?

04:00.660 --> 04:03.295
I'm on a very tight
deadline with this, Ted.

04:03.330 --> 04:05.498
I need Veronica to focus.
You know her boyfriend.

04:05.532 --> 04:07.432
You should tell him to dial it down

04:07.466 --> 04:10.368
- so Veronica can do her job.
- Well, let's see. Would a guy welcome another guy

04:10.403 --> 04:12.871
telling him to have less
sex with his girlfriend?

04:12.905 --> 04:16.774
Yeah. That a normal thing
guys tell each other to do.

04:16.809 --> 04:18.777
So you think it's
okay for a relationship

04:18.810 --> 04:20.812
to be completely on the man's terms?

04:20.846 --> 04:24.149
- God, you'd be hard to go out with.
- H... I am fantastic to go out with.

04:24.184 --> 04:26.152
I... I'm thoughtful as a man can be

04:26.186 --> 04:28.955
while still pillaging like
a viking in the bedroom.

04:28.989 --> 04:31.491
But I am not getting involved
in Veronica's personal life.

04:31.525 --> 04:34.394
So my boss gets to have all
the sex-fun of a relationship

04:34.428 --> 04:36.897
while all the stress of being exhausted

04:36.931 --> 04:41.016
trickles down to me?
Man, capitalism blows.

04:41.017 --> 04:48.017
Sync by yescool - corrected by chamallow35
www.addic7ed.com

04:47.518 --> 04:49.119
We have a problem.

04:49.153 --> 04:51.288
- What's with the red lab coat?
- Exactly.

04:51.322 --> 04:53.691
The company wants me to wear it.
- Why?

04:53.725 --> 04:55.993
- Exactly.
- I called the laundry people.

04:56.027 --> 04:58.562
They said it was assigned to
me, but they don't know why.

04:58.596 --> 05:01.832
- The laundry people useless.
- Well, they do do laundry.

05:01.866 --> 05:03.866
You love the laundry people.

05:03.901 --> 05:05.668
You take their side in everything.

05:05.702 --> 05:08.337
First of all, I do
love the laundry people.

05:08.372 --> 05:10.973
Secondly, I'll look into the coat.

05:11.007 --> 05:13.476
In the meantime, maybe
it's not a bad thing.

05:13.510 --> 05:16.479
Maybe the company is singling you
out because you did something good.

05:16.514 --> 05:20.518
Maybe it's an honor.

05:20.552 --> 05:22.920
I did finish the super-fast
spy pigeon project

05:22.955 --> 05:26.157
- ahead of schedule. - I worked on
the super-fast spy pigeon project.

05:26.191 --> 05:28.326
I'm the one that made it wireless.

05:28.330 --> 05:30.928
Before me, it could only spy
on people right next to it.

05:30.962 --> 05:33.731
- Why didn't I get a red lab coat?
- I did more work than you.

05:33.765 --> 05:36.734
I was late one day because
my wife was choking.

05:36.768 --> 05:38.736
It's not fair!

05:38.771 --> 05:40.571
I'm penalized because my
wife eats breakfast fast.

05:40.606 --> 05:42.707
- She's hungry in the morning.
- He's here.

05:42.741 --> 05:44.709
- Oh, thank God.
- Who?

05:44.743 --> 05:47.578
- I don't care. It gets me out of this.
- Mordor. Veronica's boyfriend.

05:47.613 --> 05:51.082
He says he's surprising her
and taking her to lunch and sex.

05:51.116 --> 05:53.918
The man is relentless and very candid.

05:53.952 --> 05:56.754
Wow. Can you imagine
how great it would be

05:56.788 --> 05:59.657
to just take Veronica out
in the middle of the day

05:59.691 --> 06:01.125
and have lunch with her?

06:01.159 --> 06:04.228
You should try to aim
higher with your fantasies.

06:04.262 --> 06:06.797
Veronica is supposed to
meet with Chet this afternoon

06:06.831 --> 06:08.800
and get us that extension.

06:08.834 --> 06:10.869
What if she comes back
exhausted and purring?

06:10.903 --> 06:12.737
You're right.

06:12.772 --> 06:15.073
All right. I'll go talk to Mordor.

06:15.108 --> 06:17.642
The man lives a life of excess.

06:17.677 --> 06:19.678
Maybe I can sell him on
the exciting adventure

06:19.712 --> 06:22.247
of having less sex with his
incredibly hot girlfriend.

06:22.281 --> 06:24.249
I may phrase it differently.

06:24.284 --> 06:26.952
Hey, Mordor.

06:27.020 --> 06:29.387
Hey, Ted.

06:29.422 --> 06:31.289
Um, I need to talk to you

06:31.324 --> 06:33.892
- about something that's a little awkward.
- You have a crush on me.

06:33.926 --> 06:37.728
- What? No. What?
- Men often do, Ted. I find it's best to just get it out there.

06:37.763 --> 06:40.297
No, no. Th... this is about Veronica.

06:40.332 --> 06:42.533
See, she has a very high-pressure job.

06:42.567 --> 06:44.534
And she does it with 100% focus.

06:44.569 --> 06:47.337
Oh, she's the same in bed
or when dismembering a goat.

06:47.371 --> 06:50.407
Right. So you and the
other animals have seen it.

06:50.442 --> 06:51.876
The thing is,

06:51.910 --> 06:55.046
lately, she hasn't been
getting enough sleep...

06:55.081 --> 06:57.883
Because she's with you...

06:57.917 --> 07:00.552
Doing things, things that are fun,

07:00.586 --> 07:03.189
but, you know, tire a gal out.

07:03.223 --> 07:05.058
Whoa. Wh...

07:05.092 --> 07:06.492
A... are you suggesting

07:06.527 --> 07:09.362
that sometimes when I'm with Veronica,

07:09.396 --> 07:12.097
- I should... just let her go to sleep?
- Exactly.

07:12.132 --> 07:14.199
And then have sex with her?

07:14.233 --> 07:16.134
I'm gonna start again.

07:16.168 --> 07:19.137
It would be good if you
had less sex with Veronica.

07:19.171 --> 07:20.838
The end.

07:33.619 --> 07:36.921
Hey. What did you say to Mordor?

07:36.956 --> 07:39.491
I did not tell him to
have sex with Veronica

07:39.525 --> 07:41.427
while she's sleeping.

07:41.461 --> 07:44.030
- Why? What did he do?
- I walked into the supply closet,

07:44.064 --> 07:46.733
and he was in there with
Ashley from accounting,

07:46.767 --> 07:48.768
and they were not looking for supplies

07:48.802 --> 07:51.237
unless she uses her ya-ha
to store office supplies

07:51.271 --> 07:53.273
and uses his Yang-doodle
to look for things.

07:53.307 --> 07:55.742
- That's what my mom calls it.
- All I said was maybe he should

07:55.776 --> 07:57.810
dial it down a little bit with Veronica.

07:57.845 --> 08:00.813
Well, he must have taken that
as a green light to fool around,

08:00.848 --> 08:02.948
because was going at
that accounting chick

08:02.983 --> 08:05.818
- like he wanted sparks to come out.
- Well, gee. Maybe it was a mistake

08:05.852 --> 08:07.820
to get involved in
Veronica's personal life.

08:07.854 --> 08:09.888
Oh, don't be that guy
who points fingers.

08:09.923 --> 08:11.456
No one likes a pointer.

08:11.491 --> 08:13.726
Even in the dog world,
they're seen as insufferable.

08:13.760 --> 08:16.796
- Veronica needs to know what's going on.
- Oh, no, no, no. She doesn't need to know.

08:16.830 --> 08:18.298
No one needs to know.

08:18.332 --> 08:20.533
In fact, you should forget.
And I... I will, too.

08:20.568 --> 08:23.667
- Forget what? - I don't even remember. - It's
happening in the office. She's gonna find out.

08:23.701 --> 08:26.302
Better from you than from office gossip.

08:26.337 --> 08:29.005
Me? You mean the... the person
who didn't want to get involved

08:29.039 --> 08:32.107
- in this in the first place?
- I can't believe you're still bringing that up.

08:32.142 --> 08:35.443
You've really got a stick up
your boodle-doodle about that.

08:39.981 --> 08:42.349
Veronica.

08:42.383 --> 08:44.717
We need to talk.

08:44.752 --> 08:46.185
Veronica.

08:46.220 --> 08:48.420
What? Oh, Ted.

08:48.455 --> 08:51.357
I was having the best
dream about Mordor.

08:51.391 --> 08:54.492
He makes me so happy.

08:54.527 --> 08:56.394
I feel free and untethered,

08:56.428 --> 08:59.030
like a spy pigeon without a wire.

08:59.064 --> 09:00.698
So what's up?

09:04.268 --> 09:06.369
The red lab coat.

09:06.404 --> 09:09.906
- The guys were wondering what it means.
- Well, you can't tell them,

09:09.940 --> 09:11.941
but it has no meaning whatsoever.

09:11.976 --> 09:14.343
- It was given out randomly.
- Why?

09:14.377 --> 09:16.778
The company commissioned a study
which showed that any change

09:16.813 --> 09:18.513
in the work environment
increases productivity.

09:18.548 --> 09:21.616
- Any change, it doesn't matter what.
- That's crazy.

09:21.650 --> 09:23.384
Giving one person a different lab coat

09:23.419 --> 09:25.486
can't possibly make
everybody work harder.

09:25.521 --> 09:28.723
- I am so going to win that coat tomorrow.
- Oh, no, you're not,

09:28.757 --> 09:31.125
because I'm working faster
and more efficiently than ever.

09:31.160 --> 09:33.060
So the painted stripe
that appeared suddenly

09:33.095 --> 09:36.163
- in the hallway last week?
- You mean two days before quarterly reports were due,

09:36.197 --> 09:38.732
all of which were turned in early?

09:38.766 --> 09:40.200
And the drinking fountain

09:40.234 --> 09:42.235
that just stopped working for no reason?

09:42.269 --> 09:45.071
That was broken, Ted. God,
you people are paranoid.

09:45.105 --> 09:47.574
No wonder the company has
to secretly manipulate you.

09:47.608 --> 09:50.276
So... is there anything else?

09:50.310 --> 09:51.377
Nope.

09:55.983 --> 09:59.552
- Mordor is having an affair with somebody in the office.
- What?

09:59.586 --> 10:02.154
Someone walked in on
them in the supply room,

10:02.188 --> 10:04.757
and I thought I should
tell you, Veronica.

10:04.791 --> 10:07.359
I'm sorry. But why?
Why would he do this?

10:07.393 --> 10:09.827
It's not like he's not
getting enough from me.

10:09.862 --> 10:13.130
Well, who knows why people
do what they do, you know?

10:13.165 --> 10:15.032
The important thing
is not to blame anyone

10:15.067 --> 10:16.901
or look for answers, really.

10:16.935 --> 10:19.136
Some things just shouldn't be probed.

10:19.204 --> 10:22.572
There's an unfortunate choice of words.

10:22.607 --> 10:25.008
I rambled on like that for ten minutes,

10:25.042 --> 10:26.442
somehow using the words

10:26.477 --> 10:29.045
"thrust," "prod," "rigid" and "impale."

10:29.079 --> 10:30.747
All comforting terms.

10:30.781 --> 10:33.417
Well, it's good she knows about Mordor.

10:33.451 --> 10:36.153
If it were me, I'd want
to know. Is she okay?

10:36.188 --> 10:38.690
I think so. They haven't
been together that long,

10:38.724 --> 10:40.292
and she's pretty tough.

10:40.326 --> 10:42.561
So I'm guessing they're gonna be okay.

10:42.596 --> 10:44.730
Hey, scuba girl. You ready to go?

10:44.764 --> 10:46.833
You shot me!

10:46.867 --> 10:48.902
I'm sorry. It was an accident.

10:49.471 --> 10:52.766
Although... who's Ashley?

10:54.844 --> 10:56.511
I don't know what happened.

10:56.546 --> 10:59.417
I was packing up the
speargun, and it just went off.

10:59.418 --> 11:01.981
- So it was an accident.
- Of course it was an accident.

11:02.352 --> 11:04.453
Although, the man was cheating on me,

11:04.487 --> 11:06.254
and my subconscious is very protective,

11:06.289 --> 11:08.490
and sometimes, kind of a douche.

11:08.524 --> 11:11.625
- I'm so angry, Ted.
- You have every right to be.

11:11.660 --> 11:14.796
- I'm angry at you.
- You have no right to be.

11:14.830 --> 11:17.098
Why did you tell me
Mordor was cheating on me?

11:17.132 --> 11:19.167
I... I thought you'd want to know.

11:19.201 --> 11:20.668
Linda would want to know.

11:20.703 --> 11:22.704
Well, of course I'd want to know,

11:22.738 --> 11:24.739
but not when there's a speargun

11:24.773 --> 11:26.841
sitting 3 feet away from me
and my douchey subconscious.

11:26.942 --> 11:28.742
- What were you thinking?
- Ms. Palmer?

11:28.777 --> 11:32.045
- Yes.
- He's out of surgery, and 'll fine.

11:34.182 --> 11:37.684
However, we could not save the spear.

11:37.719 --> 11:39.153
Old joke.

11:39.187 --> 11:41.689
I use it with all the family
of loved ones who survive.

11:41.723 --> 11:43.023
Don't anymore.

11:43.058 --> 11:45.759
Now I have to break up with him,

11:45.794 --> 11:48.462
which is gonna be that much harder

11:48.496 --> 11:50.497
since I just shot him.

11:50.531 --> 11:52.966
Look what you made me do.

11:54.735 --> 11:56.136
Sorry I'm late.

11:56.170 --> 11:59.172
I'm trying to get my wife
to eat slower in the morning.

11:59.206 --> 12:00.873
It's a project.

12:00.908 --> 12:04.343
- What happened to your red lab coat?
- Wasn't in my locker this morning.

12:04.377 --> 12:07.579
I don't get it. You
worked so hard yesterday.

12:07.614 --> 12:10.682
But then, so did I.

12:13.019 --> 12:14.920
Oh. Now I'm sad again.

12:14.954 --> 12:16.955
Morning, ladies.

12:17.023 --> 12:19.691
Notice anything redder about me?

12:19.726 --> 12:23.729
I am literally shaking
with jealousy. Get out!

12:23.764 --> 12:27.233
I don't want the coat to
see me like this. No, wait.

12:27.267 --> 12:29.268
Let me touch it. No, no.

12:29.303 --> 12:30.737
Wait.

12:32.540 --> 12:34.408
Your call.

12:37.512 --> 12:38.613
Ted.

12:38.647 --> 12:41.149
I've been thinking about
how I behaved last night,

12:41.183 --> 12:43.117
and I've realized, it wasn't your fault

12:43.152 --> 12:45.186
that Mordor somehow got himself sh.

12:45.221 --> 12:46.888
And so I'd like to apologize.

12:46.922 --> 12:48.323
Oh, that's okay.

12:48.357 --> 12:50.325
I'm just glad you're rid of him.

12:50.359 --> 12:52.093
Um, that guy was a
self-absorbed dill-hole.

12:52.127 --> 12:56.029
- Ted...
- "Ooh, I'm Mordor. I think all men are in love with me."

12:56.064 --> 12:58.131
I mean, seriously, what a doofus.

12:58.166 --> 13:00.400
We made up.

13:00.434 --> 13:01.868
Oh, good,

13:01.902 --> 13:05.371
'cause now I can stop
pretending I don't like him.

13:05.406 --> 13:07.874
He had an affair, and I shot him.

13:07.909 --> 13:10.077
So we decided to call it even.

13:10.111 --> 13:12.279
Plus, I found out why he did it.

13:12.314 --> 13:14.215
Apparently somebody
suggested that he ease up

13:14.250 --> 13:16.785
- on our relationship.
- Well, I didn't mean for him to...

13:16.819 --> 13:19.421
It was you?

13:20.824 --> 13:22.425
What was me?

13:22.459 --> 13:23.893
My God, Ted.

13:23.928 --> 13:26.863
You don't tell a man like
Mordor to be less passionate.

13:26.931 --> 13:28.831
It's like telling Gandhi to be less...

13:28.866 --> 13:31.935
- Whatever he was... thin.
- You weren't getting your job done.

13:31.969 --> 13:34.937
You... you were falling asleep
at work with your eyes open.

13:34.971 --> 13:36.939
What... what if they dried out?

13:36.974 --> 13:38.874
They would've lost their luster.

13:38.909 --> 13:40.943
I was worried about your luster.

13:40.977 --> 13:44.647
I don't need you or anyone
else interfering in my life.

13:44.681 --> 13:46.949
You're responsible for my boyfriend
screwing around. You're the one who shot him.

13:46.983 --> 13:50.151
In my mind.

13:50.186 --> 13:52.221
And then you call him a dill-hole

13:52.255 --> 13:54.156
right to his face.

13:54.190 --> 13:56.592
- No, I...
- In my mind.

13:56.626 --> 13:58.561
I think you and I need a
little distance from each other.

13:58.595 --> 14:01.463
That's a good idea.
I'll go to my office.

14:01.498 --> 14:04.767
Actually, I was thinking
a little more distance.

14:06.036 --> 14:10.906
And so Veronica sent me down
to the ridiculously tiny office.

14:18.815 --> 14:20.082
Ah.

14:33.162 --> 14:34.929
Whoa!

14:34.964 --> 14:37.165
Hi, Ted.

14:37.199 --> 14:38.900
Phil.

14:38.935 --> 14:40.902
Hi, Ted.

14:40.936 --> 14:42.704
Lem.

14:44.507 --> 14:46.575
This is not as bad as I imagined.

14:46.609 --> 14:49.444
It makes your chair and desk
look gigantic, which is cool.

14:49.478 --> 14:52.414
Plus, it would be impossible
to lose anything in here.

14:52.448 --> 14:55.784
No, it's all great.
So what's up, fellas?

14:55.818 --> 14:58.587
'Cause I'm pretty busy
getting into my chair.

14:58.621 --> 15:00.222
We're... unhappy about something.

15:00.256 --> 15:01.824
Is this about the coat?

15:01.858 --> 15:04.193
I worked my ass off
yesterday to get that thing.

15:04.228 --> 15:06.629
I can't tell you
exactly what's going on.

15:06.663 --> 15:09.465
I'm in enough trouble as it is with
Veronica. But the coat may not be

15:09.499 --> 15:11.400
something you want to
work extra hard to get.

15:11.434 --> 15:15.370
Yeah, but it's... it's so beautiful.

15:15.405 --> 15:17.239
Only because you think it means
something, which it may not.

15:17.273 --> 15:20.575
I think I know what's going on.

15:20.610 --> 15:23.679
- We're confused.
- That's exactly what's happening.

15:23.713 --> 15:26.114
Oh, Ted.

15:26.149 --> 15:28.617
I can't believe you trashed
Veronica's boyfriend.

15:28.651 --> 15:30.586
- Hey, guys.
- Hey, Linda.

15:30.620 --> 15:33.388
You never trash the boyfriend.
What if they get back together?

15:33.422 --> 15:36.158
I don't care anymore. I'm out.

15:36.192 --> 15:39.028
I am done getting in the middle
of Veronica's relationship.

15:39.062 --> 15:40.562
Because believe it or not,

15:40.597 --> 15:42.364
there's an office smaller than this,
and you have to share it with someone.

15:42.399 --> 15:44.934
Well, you should be out, because clearly
you don't know anything about relationships.

15:44.968 --> 15:48.471
I don't know anything
about relationships?

15:48.505 --> 15:51.174
It... what... it's because of
your relationship geniusness

15:51.209 --> 15:53.543
- that I'm stuck in Polly pocket's house.
- We should go.

15:53.578 --> 15:55.713
- We want to go.
- Thanks to me? I never told you

15:55.747 --> 15:59.250
- to tell Veronica that her boyfriend sucks.
- I wouldn't have kept talking about her sucky boyfriend

15:59.284 --> 16:03.088
- if you hadn't kept bringing him up.
- I had to bring it up, because you think

16:03.122 --> 16:05.958
relationships are all
about what the guy wants.

16:05.992 --> 16:07.493
And by the way, genius,

16:07.527 --> 16:10.095
Polly pockets doesn't live in a house.

16:10.130 --> 16:12.398
- She lives in a clamshell!
- I know where she lives.

16:12.432 --> 16:14.900
Oh, really? Because
I think you know less

16:14.935 --> 16:16.802
about Polly pockets than
you do about relationships.

16:16.837 --> 16:18.503
That's better.

16:18.538 --> 16:22.174
So if the coat's not a reward
for doing something good,

16:22.208 --> 16:25.177
then that must mean... it's a
punishment for doing something bad.

16:25.211 --> 16:27.112
It's like a Scarlet
letter. Only it's worse,

16:27.147 --> 16:29.915
because it covers the
whole body in shame.

16:29.950 --> 16:33.385
- So why'd the company give it to me?
- You did break

16:33.419 --> 16:35.687
the dieoxolater defibulation
splung manifold last week,

16:35.721 --> 16:39.390
- and that sucka is expensive.
- If only I hadn't tried to protect my eyes when it burst,

16:39.425 --> 16:41.959
I might have been able to save it.

16:41.994 --> 16:43.594
Stupid reflexes.

16:43.628 --> 16:45.262
The next morning,

16:45.296 --> 16:48.164
I checked in with Veronica
to see if I could come back.

16:48.199 --> 16:49.633
Good morning, sunshine.

16:49.667 --> 16:51.769
Not yet.

16:53.672 --> 16:55.640
And in the lab...

16:55.675 --> 16:57.876
Uh-oh.

16:57.910 --> 17:00.445
It was in my locker this morning.

17:00.480 --> 17:05.483
I worked so hard yesterday
to avoid this exact thing.

17:05.518 --> 17:07.819
All we can do is buckle down

17:07.854 --> 17:11.689
and push ourselves even harder.

17:11.723 --> 17:13.557
I hope Veronica forgives me soon,

17:13.590 --> 17:17.261
because I really like doing this...

17:17.329 --> 17:19.563
Which I totally took for granted before.

17:21.866 --> 17:23.733
What the hell?

17:23.768 --> 17:26.502
Ted, wh... I... I thought you
were working out of the basement.

17:26.537 --> 17:30.006
- Well, I'm getting some papers. What are you doing?
- Well, well, this is, um...

17:30.041 --> 17:32.275
Tiffany.

17:32.309 --> 17:34.878
Thank you. See, I figured it out.

17:34.912 --> 17:36.813
I hurt Veronica by fooling around,

17:36.848 --> 17:38.548
but then she hurt me
back with a speargun,

17:38.583 --> 17:40.817
and that reset the relationship.

17:40.851 --> 17:44.053
So I can fool around again
as long as I'm willing

17:44.088 --> 17:46.256
to let Veronica hurt
me again, which I am,

17:46.290 --> 17:49.393
'cause I like promiscuous sex
far more than I dislike pain.

17:49.427 --> 17:51.428
You know, I didn't want to get involved

17:51.463 --> 17:52.864
in Veronica's personal life,

17:52.898 --> 17:56.267
but now I'm glad I did,
because you don't deserve her.

17:56.301 --> 17:58.236
She is smart and... and
beautiful and confident...

17:58.270 --> 18:00.038
Wildly fun in bed...

18:00.072 --> 18:02.340
Yeah, I've been there.
She is the whole package.

18:02.375 --> 18:04.243
And you're just a jerk.

18:04.277 --> 18:06.212
And, yes, a mammoth dill-hole.

18:06.246 --> 18:08.581
All right, Ted. Let's go.

18:08.615 --> 18:10.216
You started this whole thing,

18:10.250 --> 18:12.518
and now you insult me
in front of Tiffany.

18:12.553 --> 18:15.354
- Let's get this over with.
- I'm not gonna fight you, you loon.

18:15.388 --> 18:19.425
Loon? Could a loon do this?

18:19.460 --> 18:21.094
Hmm?

18:24.632 --> 18:26.466
I think a loon would do exactly that.

18:26.500 --> 18:28.568
It's called
quad-dela-ron-sha.

18:30.070 --> 18:32.005
It's an ancient Peruvian martial art

18:32.039 --> 18:33.806
involving forceful
and repeated slapping.

18:33.840 --> 18:36.775
I'm not gonna fight you.

18:38.878 --> 18:40.879
Okay, wait. Yes, I'll fight you.

18:40.913 --> 18:42.847
Ouch! What the hell?

18:42.881 --> 18:45.349
It's like you have a hundred fingers.

18:47.352 --> 18:50.182
God, Tiffany, go get help!

18:59.270 --> 19:01.238
It's why Peru was never conquered.

19:01.272 --> 19:03.006
Didn't the Spanish conquer Peru?

19:03.041 --> 19:05.075
Yes, but then they left quickly.

19:05.110 --> 19:06.543
In fact,
quad-dela-ron-sha

19:06.578 --> 19:09.012
means "leave, or we'll
start with the slapping."

19:09.046 --> 19:11.848
Did Mordor tell you this?
'Cause it's not on Google.

19:11.882 --> 19:14.350
Maybe that was also a lie.

19:14.384 --> 19:16.686
Oh, I'm through with him, Ted.

19:16.720 --> 19:20.022
Listen, I'm sorry about everything.

19:20.057 --> 19:22.225
Ted, you stood up for me.

19:22.259 --> 19:25.362
No one's ever done that before.

19:26.898 --> 19:29.767
Thank you.

19:29.801 --> 19:32.871
Maybe it's impossible to
keep your personal life

19:32.905 --> 19:35.274
completely separate from work,

19:35.308 --> 19:38.510
especially when you care about
the people you work with...

19:38.544 --> 19:41.280
And they care about you.

19:41.347 --> 19:43.014
Is he all right?

19:43.049 --> 19:44.416
He's great.

19:44.450 --> 19:46.551
I can't believe he fought
to defend your honor.

19:46.586 --> 19:48.119
- That is so...
- Hot?

19:48.154 --> 19:51.557
- Actually, yeah.
- It kind of is.

19:51.591 --> 19:54.860
And I told him he didn't know
anything about relationships.

19:54.894 --> 19:58.731
He may not, but he'd
sure be good in one.

20:07.241 --> 20:11.111
What have I done?!

20:11.145 --> 20:14.114
And since I do care about
the people I work with,

20:14.148 --> 20:16.917
I decided to end their suffering.

20:18.753 --> 20:20.621
Since any change helps productivity,

20:20.655 --> 20:22.956
why not make it a positive change

20:22.991 --> 20:26.560
and do something people
can feel good about?

20:29.797 --> 20:31.798
What does it mean?

20:31.832 --> 20:33.800
