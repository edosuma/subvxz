00:08.666 --> 00:09.866
Rough day?

00:09.933 --> 00:12.033
I knew you were
gonna ask me that.

00:12.100 --> 00:13.066
What's wrong?

00:13.133 --> 00:15.266
I knew you were
gonna ask me that.

00:15.333 --> 00:18.200
And I'm not in the mood
for the flippant remark

00:18.266 --> 00:20.866
that you're about to make.

00:20.933 --> 00:23.200
Life is just too predictable.

00:23.266 --> 00:25.466
Well, life is is predictable
for me too.

00:25.533 --> 00:28.266
Once again, you're sitting
on the couch..

00:28.333 --> 00:30.300
...whining about yourself.

00:38.133 --> 00:43.100
Oh, I know that is not
my cruelty free, ozone friendly

00:43.166 --> 00:47.500
dolphin safe, condor egg
moisturizer.

00:48.466 --> 00:49.533
[knock on door]

00:49.600 --> 00:52.833
(Synclaire)
'Regine, Khadija, it's me!'

00:52.900 --> 00:54.800
She lost her keys again.

00:54.866 --> 00:59.266
'I lost my keys, again.'

00:59.333 --> 01:01.406
She's your cousin,
you let her in.

01:01.473 --> 01:04.506
I have condor egg
on my hands.

01:07.273 --> 01:08.773
Thanks, Max.

01:15.340 --> 01:17.440
You know I still do not
understand why

01:17.506 --> 01:20.140
this woman has keys
to our apart..

01:20.206 --> 01:21.506
You know what, here..

01:21.573 --> 01:24.040
Here you go, Synclaire.

01:24.106 --> 01:26.406
Fine with me,
I have spares.

01:28.240 --> 01:32.206
& We are living single &

01:32.273 --> 01:35.340
& Oh in a 90's kinda world &

01:35.406 --> 01:37.406
& I'm glad I got my girls &

01:37.473 --> 01:38.506
& Keep your head up
What &

01:38.573 --> 01:40.140
& Keep your head up
That's right &

01:40.206 --> 01:42.173
& Whenever this life gets tough
you gotta fight &

01:42.240 --> 01:44.473
& My home girl standing standing
to my left and my right &

01:44.540 --> 01:46.340
& True blue we tight like glue &

01:46.406 --> 01:51.106
& We are living single &&

02:01.113 --> 02:03.413
One of my clients referred
this business to me, right?

02:03.480 --> 02:05.213
I wanted to find
the appropriate way

02:05.280 --> 02:06.413
to thank her.

02:06.480 --> 02:07.513
How about flowers?

02:07.580 --> 02:09.113
Uh, she's a businesswoman.

02:09.180 --> 02:10.979
I don't wanna seem sexist,
you know?

02:11.045 --> 02:14.746
But Kyle, you are sexist.

02:14.813 --> 02:19.713
All the more reason
not to appear so.

02:19.779 --> 02:22.146
Max, if you were a woman..

02:27.746 --> 02:30.580
What would you want as a gift?

02:30.646 --> 02:32.646
A cattle prod.

02:32.713 --> 02:35.946
But, that's more for you
than me.

02:36.013 --> 02:39.246
Oh, wow. The Delia Devo show
want be back.

02:39.313 --> 02:40.680
Did they like your idea..

02:40.746 --> 02:44.480
"people who never gave up
their imaginary friends?"

02:44.546 --> 02:46.780
No, I suggested that
to the Ricky Leck Show.

02:46.846 --> 02:48.313
I wrote to Delia about being

02:48.380 --> 02:49.846
on singles who live together
segment.

02:49.913 --> 02:51.646
Oh, Delia is my favorite.

02:51.713 --> 02:54.480
I loved her book
I Cry, You Cry.

02:54.546 --> 02:58.780
Oh my god! Oh my god,
she wants us on the show.

02:58.846 --> 03:04.020
Hey ya'll, she wants us on
as roommates from heaven.

03:04.086 --> 03:05.453
Wait, wait, wait. Come on.

03:05.520 --> 03:07.720
Surely you are not
going to do it.

03:07.786 --> 03:09.786
Talk shows are just
sleazy entertainment

03:09.853 --> 03:12.986
for the truly desperate
so they can come for themselves

03:13.053 --> 03:15.453
by watching the pathetic.

03:17.686 --> 03:19.486
Well I beg to differ, Kyle.

03:19.553 --> 03:21.753
I think talk shows
are very informative.

03:21.820 --> 03:24.786
Did you know that there are
more adulterers per capita

03:24.853 --> 03:29.853
in Alabama than anywhere else
in the continent of U. S.?

03:29.920 --> 03:32.786
Hold up, yo. Roommates from
heaven, we are not.

03:32.853 --> 03:34.053
Now, that's not true.

03:34.120 --> 03:36.620
If you saw how I treat
people outside this house.

03:36.686 --> 03:41.253
You'd know how close
I feel to ya'll.

03:41.320 --> 03:43.586
Khadija, Delia thinks we're
roommates from heaven.

03:43.653 --> 03:45.553
I think she knows
more about relationships

03:45.620 --> 03:49.353
than you do, she's been married
six times, alright?

03:49.420 --> 03:53.686
Well, you two convince me.
I ain't going.

03:53.753 --> 03:56.586
Alright, look. Khadijah,
for the last few weeks

03:56.653 --> 03:58.520
I've been feeling like
something's been missing

03:58.586 --> 04:02.393
from my life, but now
I know what it is.

04:02.460 --> 04:06.093
Being on T. V!

04:06.160 --> 04:08.560
Regine, you are obsessed.

04:08.626 --> 04:13.393
I'm not obsessed. I'll just die
if I don't get on that show.

04:13.460 --> 04:15.426
Say you'll do it,
say it, say it!

04:15.493 --> 04:19.192
Alright. I'll do it.

04:21.060 --> 04:26.593
Oh, look at us.
Blissfully co‐existing.

04:26.660 --> 04:31.460
Khadijah, this is not the outfit
I laid out for you.

04:31.526 --> 04:33.093
Oh, that was you?

04:33.159 --> 04:35.393
I thought mother stopped
by to get me ready

04:35.459 --> 04:39.093
for the 3rd grade
class picture.

04:39.159 --> 04:41.893
If we're goin' to show
how our lives are in harmony

04:41.960 --> 04:43.493
our clothes have to be too.

04:43.560 --> 04:48.826
I'm wearing canary,
you cannot wear indigo.

04:48.893 --> 04:51.726
I'm wearing this, you could
change your outfit

04:51.793 --> 04:53.460
if you want to.

04:53.526 --> 04:58.060
I do not wear outfits,
I create looks.

04:58.126 --> 05:02.866
And the look I was going for
was chic happy roommmates.

05:02.933 --> 05:06.466
But, now it's chic
happy roommate and..

05:10.533 --> 05:12.900
And the two of you.

05:12.966 --> 05:14.266
Alright, listen Regine.

05:14.333 --> 05:16.300
The harmony's not gonna come
from our clothing

05:16.366 --> 05:17.833
it's gonna come from our auras.

05:17.900 --> 05:20.400
Let's all hold on
to this piece of rose quartz

05:20.466 --> 05:24.000
and channel positive energy?
Get some.

05:25.600 --> 05:28.500
Alright, forget it. Forget
talking about clothes, huh.

05:28.566 --> 05:30.566
Let's talk about what we're
going to say.

05:30.633 --> 05:32.866
Now, I have outlined
a few do's and don'ts.

05:32.933 --> 05:34.600
For example Khedijah.

05:34.666 --> 05:38.933
Keep your sarcasm and tedious
work stories to a minimum.

05:42.633 --> 05:43.800
Synclaire, honey.

05:43.866 --> 05:47.266
Try not to get that blank
look on your face.

05:51.400 --> 05:52.666
Never mind.

05:52.733 --> 05:57.466
So, Regine. Can we talk about
that APS carrier

05:57.533 --> 05:58.466
that dumped you?

05:58.533 --> 05:59.600
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

05:59.666 --> 06:03.006
I'm just trying to get
a little over the line.

06:03.073 --> 06:04.973
Khadijah, if you don't
take this seriously

06:05.040 --> 06:06.240
you'll blow
the whole thing.

06:06.306 --> 06:10.240
Blow the whole thing,
I tell ya.

06:10.306 --> 06:12.406
Stop that, that is your
nerves talking.

06:12.473 --> 06:14.973
As a veteran of the stage,
I can tell you

06:15.040 --> 06:17.040
that there is nothing
to worry about.

06:17.106 --> 06:21.573
Honey, you've been in one play.

06:21.640 --> 06:25.806
And the audience
at the Wheel of Fortune.

06:28.506 --> 06:29.773
Alright gang, here we go.

06:29.840 --> 06:34.273
Standing by,
in five, four, three, two..

06:37.406 --> 06:41.940
We're back, and if you're
just tuning in, you missed it.

06:42.006 --> 06:44.306
Look at them.

06:44.373 --> 06:48.640
The roommates
from hell..reconcile.

06:48.706 --> 06:51.440
I'm sorry I took a contract
out on you.

06:51.506 --> 06:55.673
I'm sorry I burned down
your mother's house.

06:55.740 --> 06:59.406
[audience applauding]

06:59.473 --> 07:02.880
Ow!

07:02.946 --> 07:08.646
Thank you God!
For letting me Delia.

07:08.713 --> 07:10.946
Bring these people together.

07:13.580 --> 07:17.813
And now, let's take a look
at the other side

07:17.880 --> 07:19.546
of our roommate coin.

07:19.613 --> 07:22.046
The roommates from heaven.

07:22.113 --> 07:23.346
Here they are.

07:23.413 --> 07:28.280
Khadijah James, Regine Hunter,
and Synclaire James.

07:28.346 --> 07:29.980
[audience applauding]

07:30.046 --> 07:32.213
Oh yeah.

07:32.280 --> 07:33.580
Welcome, ladies.

07:33.646 --> 07:35.780
Thank you.

07:35.846 --> 07:39.813
These women are here
because of a 27 page letter

07:39.880 --> 07:43.280
Synclaire sent our producers.

07:44.180 --> 07:45.846
And, here's a little taste.

07:45.913 --> 07:52.113
"Dear Delia, I want to tell you
about my roommates Regine

07:52.180 --> 07:57.346
"and my cousin Khadijah. when I
moved to New york from Minnesota

07:57.413 --> 08:01.253
"I knew right away I had found
two friendly worms

08:01.320 --> 08:03.486
"in the Big Apple.

08:03.553 --> 08:10.253
"Together, we share, we care,
we do each other's hair."

08:11.886 --> 08:16.353
They're more than roommates.
They're the sisters I never had.

08:16.420 --> 08:19.520
They are.

08:19.586 --> 08:23.753
This is really beautiful,
ladies.

08:23.820 --> 08:24.753
Or is it?

08:26.953 --> 08:31.586
Audience, can three women
share an apartment

08:31.653 --> 08:34.385
and truly live
in heavenly bliss?

08:34.453 --> 08:36.620
No, Delia, no!

08:39.385 --> 08:43.486
Why, I have to tell you, if I
did not live the miracle

08:43.553 --> 08:46.820
everyday myself, I wouldn't
believe it.

08:46.886 --> 08:50.653
‐ Delia, Delia!
‐ Okay.

08:52.853 --> 08:56.353
Are you the same Khadijah James
who publishes

08:56.420 --> 09:00.660
the hip urban, always
informative, Flavor magazine?

09:03.260 --> 09:06.326
Why, yes. I am.

09:07.293 --> 09:09.193
Flavor is my favorite.

09:09.260 --> 09:10.860
Please tell these
wonderful people

09:10.926 --> 09:14.860
how they too can
get the flavor.

09:14.926 --> 09:18.060
Well now, if you're done
with that shameless plug

09:18.126 --> 09:19.860
you wanna tell
us who you are?

09:19.926 --> 09:23.426
Maxine Shaw,
attorney at law.

09:23.493 --> 09:25.593
She practically lives with us.

09:25.660 --> 09:29.526
And is a welcomed guest
anytime, day or night.

09:32.026 --> 09:34.693
You got that on videotape,
right?

09:34.760 --> 09:37.026
Well Max, since you know
our roommates so well

09:37.093 --> 09:38.560
why don't you come on stage?

09:38.626 --> 09:39.826
I dunno if I should.

09:39.893 --> 09:41.993
[applauding]

09:46.726 --> 09:48.626
Alright, ha ha ha.

09:48.693 --> 09:51.793
Are there anymore friends
in the audience?

09:52.726 --> 09:54.560
Okay, okay.

09:54.626 --> 09:56.226
And..and you are?

09:56.293 --> 10:00.060
Uh, Overton Wakefield Jones,
I'm Synclaire's boyfriend

10:00.126 --> 10:02.666
or in T. V talk show terms,
her significant other

10:02.733 --> 10:06.466
non co habitant.

10:06.533 --> 10:09.000
And whose boyfriend are you?

10:09.066 --> 10:12.466
Many satisfied ladies in the
greater metropolitan area.

10:12.533 --> 10:13.633
[audience booing]

10:13.700 --> 10:16.700
Woah, woah. What I meant
to say was that uh

10:16.766 --> 10:20.466
women are the backbone
of this great country.

10:20.533 --> 10:22.366
[audience applauding]

10:22.433 --> 10:24.066
Alright.

10:24.133 --> 10:26.200
Alright ladies, why don't
we say

10:26.266 --> 10:29.233
let's get down
to the nitty gritty, huh?

10:29.300 --> 10:30.500
Khadijah!

10:30.566 --> 10:34.566
I can look into your eyes
and see that you

10:34.633 --> 10:37.966
got a story to tell.

10:38.033 --> 10:41.966
Not me. I tell all my stories
in Flavor.

10:42.033 --> 10:44.000
An award winning magazine
available

10:44.066 --> 10:47.100
at news stands everywhere.

10:47.166 --> 10:49.400
Khadijah, this is not about you
and your magazine.

10:49.466 --> 10:51.966
It's about me and us.

10:52.033 --> 10:56.633
Alright now, come on Khadija.
Now, nobody's perfect.

10:56.700 --> 10:58.266
Or..

10:58.333 --> 11:01.440
Just maybe my producer's made
a mistake in booking you girls.

11:01.506 --> 11:05.406
Oh, no, no, no!

11:05.473 --> 11:07.406
We have stories to tell.

11:07.473 --> 11:10.440
Alright then, let's make 'em
juicy.

11:10.506 --> 11:12.240
[audience cheering]

11:15.473 --> 11:20.040
Okay, okay, okay, um Khadijah,
why don't you tell Delia

11:20.106 --> 11:24.840
about one of our quirky moments
of friction.

11:28.706 --> 11:35.073
Well, if I had to say something
..and this is really small.

11:35.140 --> 11:37.940
Regine has a tendency
of holding on

11:38.006 --> 11:42.373
to her hand lotion, like a dog
with a bone.

11:42.440 --> 11:45.040
Alright, I see, I see.

11:45.106 --> 11:48.273
Ah, well. And, this is
even smaller

11:48.340 --> 11:52.140
but Khadijah
on very rare occasion.

11:52.206 --> 11:55.606
Act's as if someone
died and made her queen.

11:55.673 --> 11:56.673
(Delia)
'Queen.'

11:56.740 --> 11:58.940
[audience laughing]

11:59.006 --> 12:01.246
Oh, okay I've got
one, I've got one.

12:01.313 --> 12:04.346
Regine, sometimes has
a real cruel streak.

12:04.413 --> 12:07.046
[audience laughing]

12:07.113 --> 12:09.780
Regine! Girlfriend!

12:09.846 --> 12:13.580
Your room mates
don't seem too fond of you.

12:13.646 --> 12:17.546
Oh, no, no, now, Delia
you know how we are.

12:17.613 --> 12:21.213
Yes, I firmly do.
We heard something, didn't we?

12:21.280 --> 12:23.280
[audience]
Yes, Delia, Yes.

12:23.346 --> 12:29.246
Well, now you can't understand
their tentiest tinge of envy.

12:29.313 --> 12:31.280
Yeah, right.

12:31.346 --> 12:34.580
Well I am the glue that
holds this group together.

12:34.646 --> 12:36.146
[audience laughing]

12:36.213 --> 12:38.946
And you must have got
a few whiffs of that glue

12:39.013 --> 12:41.246
when you was putting
on mayo on the hair.

12:41.313 --> 12:42.946
[audience cheering]

12:45.680 --> 12:48.513
Well, I'm the steady paycheck.

12:48.580 --> 12:51.213
I mean Khadijah's always
putting every dime she has

12:51.280 --> 12:52.846
back into her magazine.

12:52.913 --> 12:55.913
She barley pays, Synlcaire
enough to cover her rent.

12:55.980 --> 12:59.013
Honey, it' no wonder you
begged me to move in with you.

12:59.080 --> 13:01.620
[audience laughing]

13:01.686 --> 13:03.420
I did what?

13:03.486 --> 13:05.420
She said, that you..

13:06.686 --> 13:09.186
...begged her
to move in with you.

13:11.453 --> 13:13.420
Yeah, you did.

13:13.486 --> 13:15.853
Khadijah, just shows up
on my doorstep one day

13:15.920 --> 13:21.086
with tears in her eyes
and she say, "I need your help."

13:21.153 --> 13:23.920
Well, me being
the charitable person that I am.

13:23.986 --> 13:27.686
I packed my bags
and I began my mission

13:27.753 --> 13:31.853
to bring a little sunshine
into Khadijah dreary life.

13:31.920 --> 13:33.586
[audience laughing]

13:33.653 --> 13:35.886
Alright, that's some
kind of speech, eh?

13:35.953 --> 13:38.320
[audience]
Yeah.

13:38.386 --> 13:39.620
Oh, Delia..

13:39.686 --> 13:41.553
Kha‐di‐jah.

13:41.620 --> 13:43.886
[audience laughing]

13:43.953 --> 13:45.486
Do you want the real deal?

13:45.553 --> 13:47.686
(Delia)
'Oh, we demand the deal.'

13:47.753 --> 13:50.386
[audience cheering]

13:51.086 --> 13:54.486
No, ah‐ah, no, no, no.

13:54.553 --> 13:56.886
I'm 'bout to tell
you the real deal.

13:56.953 --> 14:00.526
Regine could not keep a job
so she lived with her mother.

14:01.293 --> 14:02.593
Number one.

14:02.660 --> 14:05.726
So her mother, begged my mother

14:05.793 --> 14:08.193
to ask me, to let her move in.

14:08.260 --> 14:09.426
[audience gasping]

14:09.493 --> 14:10.493
Yes she did.

14:10.560 --> 14:12.193
[audience laughing]

14:14.793 --> 14:18.560
That's not
true. Is it?

14:18.626 --> 14:21.460
[audience]
Aww.

14:21.526 --> 14:23.126
[audience laughing]

14:27.260 --> 14:29.493
[audience cheering]

14:34.632 --> 14:36.799
Before we went
to commercial..

14:36.866 --> 14:38.966
Regine learned..

14:39.032 --> 14:42.499
...for the very first
time that Khadijah..

14:42.566 --> 14:45.232
...Really didn't want
her to move in at all.

14:45.299 --> 14:47.799
[all laughing]

14:47.866 --> 14:50.632
I thought you wanted
me to live with you.

14:52.166 --> 14:54.132
I did.

14:54.199 --> 14:56.699
As soon as my mother
suggested it the third time

14:56.766 --> 14:58.399
I jumped right on it.

14:58.466 --> 15:00.132
Regine, don't be upset.

15:00.199 --> 15:03.539
My mother arranged for me
to move in with Khadijah too.

15:03.606 --> 15:06.172
Yeah, but that's different
you need adult supervision.

15:06.239 --> 15:07.639
[audience]
Ooo.

15:07.706 --> 15:11.906
(Overton)
'Ah, no, no, no, ah.
Hold‐hold on, Ragine.'

15:11.972 --> 15:15.239
All Synlcaire did was write a
letter to get you on this show.

15:15.306 --> 15:18.039
I'd like to send a shout
out, to butch and poke

15:18.106 --> 15:21.672
all the boys at the bowling
ally, what's up how you..

15:23.806 --> 15:27.039
Khadija it's obvious..

15:27.106 --> 15:29.406
...that you had
some reservations..

15:29.472 --> 15:32.639
...about living with Regine.

15:32.706 --> 15:33.972
[hysterically]
Why?

15:34.039 --> 15:36.706
[audience laughing]

15:36.772 --> 15:39.006
Ain't it 'bout time
you brought out the farmer

15:39.072 --> 15:41.472
who that rooms
with his pig?

15:41.539 --> 15:44.006
Delia, Delia listen
it's no big deal.

15:44.072 --> 15:45.472
Khadijah's always complaining

15:45.539 --> 15:47.906
about how Regine
gets on her nerves.

15:47.972 --> 15:50.772
About everybody gets on her
nerves, I get on her nerves.

15:50.839 --> 15:53.339
Sometimes it's my goal.

15:53.406 --> 15:56.439
Alright, alright, Max
come on, you help us out here.

15:56.506 --> 15:59.106
What exactly are you saying?

15:59.172 --> 16:02.446
I don't know. I just thought
it was my turn to say something

16:02.512 --> 16:05.079
you got me up here
and your not using me.

16:06.546 --> 16:09.146
Delia, Delia,
darling come here.

16:09.212 --> 16:11.812
In defense of Regine
I'd like to say that..

16:11.879 --> 16:14.346
[audience booing]

16:14.412 --> 16:16.879
You people are
a bunch of mindless sheep

16:16.946 --> 16:19.812
[audience cheering]

16:20.846 --> 16:22.446
Alright look.

16:22.512 --> 16:25.979
If you think I'm so annoying,
why don't you just tell me?

16:26.046 --> 16:27.546
Ah, what are you saying?

16:27.612 --> 16:31.446
I am not gonna sit you down
everything to get on my nerves.

16:31.512 --> 16:33.446
Who has that kind of time.

16:33.512 --> 16:36.146
[audience cheering]

16:36.212 --> 16:39.812
Look, I have just learned
to accept you the way you are.

16:39.879 --> 16:42.946
Oh, well, accept this.

16:43.012 --> 16:45.679
[audience murmuring]

16:49.679 --> 16:50.946
I feel their pain.

16:51.012 --> 16:53.246

17:12.819 --> 17:14.152
Regine, Regine,
wait wait, baby.

17:14.219 --> 17:16.719
Why don't you try
my method of cooling down, huh?

17:16.786 --> 17:17.786
Wait, wait, come on.

17:17.852 --> 17:19.919
Just look
in the mirror and remember

17:19.986 --> 17:26.185
that you're better looking
than the people you're mad at.

17:26.252 --> 17:29.086
I can't believe that you
embarrassed me like that.

17:29.152 --> 17:33.052
Me? You're the one that started
it with all your grand standing.

17:33.119 --> 17:35.952
Come on, Regine nobody
we know saw the show.

17:36.019 --> 17:37.486
Everybody we know works.

17:37.552 --> 17:39.652
They might have
taped it like I did.

17:39.719 --> 17:42.119
[audience laughing]

17:42.186 --> 17:46.486
Well, they have TV's at work you

17:48.152 --> 17:51.319

'You weren't supposed
to find out about this'

17:53.519 --> 17:55.652
'until after I was dead.'

17:55.719 --> 17:57.186
'Way to keep
my secret, Khadijah.'

17:57.252 --> 17:59.052
[phone beeping]

17:59.119 --> 18:02.392
(Garth Ancier on phone)
'This is Garth Ancier
from the Ricki Lake show.'

18:02.459 --> 18:04.426
'We're doing a segment
on unwanted room mates'

18:04.492 --> 18:06.726
'and we were wondering
if Regine would be interested.'

18:08.759 --> 18:12.159
Thanks, thanks for making
this the worst day of my life.

18:12.226 --> 18:14.192
Regine you're
the one that begged me

18:14.259 --> 18:16.492
to go on the show
in the first place.

18:16.559 --> 18:19.392
I guess it's about time
for us to be going, Overton.

18:19.459 --> 18:23.059
This is gonna get ugly or they
gonna make up by turning on us.

18:25.992 --> 18:29.159
But a as your handy man,
let me just remind you

18:29.226 --> 18:30.992

18:31.059 --> 18:34.826

18:37.292 --> 18:39.526
Are you guys gonna
get into this right away?

18:39.592 --> 18:44.492
or do I have time to go get
me a snack? Alright I'll go.

18:44.559 --> 18:47.126
You know what the really
sad thing is, Khadijah?

18:47.192 --> 18:50.759
Finding out that our whole
friendship has been a big lie.

18:50.826 --> 18:54.026
Regine, it does not matter
how we came to be room mates.

18:54.092 --> 18:57.359
We've been living together for
years, and it's worked out fine.

18:57.426 --> 19:00.999
That's right. So now
it's time to forgive and forget.

19:01.066 --> 19:03.266
Woo‐wo‐wo.
Woo‐wo‐wo.

19:05.999 --> 19:08.717
No, 'cause see,
I don't think I can forget

19:08.783 --> 19:11.583
How Khadijah
humiliated me today.

19:11.650 --> 19:14.383
Hey, listen I say this
was a good thing, alright?

19:14.450 --> 19:17.050
You exposed some
ugly truth, you got loud.

19:17.117 --> 19:20.117
You got a free set
of still belted radios.

19:21.517 --> 19:24.550
And now it's time
to heal, group hug.

19:25.450 --> 19:27.217
I'm not hugging anybody.

19:27.283 --> 19:28.950
Especially not Khadijah.

19:29.017 --> 19:32.283
You know, I don't even wanna
be in the same room with her.

19:33.850 --> 19:37.050
In fact, I don't even
wanna live with you anymore.

19:37.117 --> 19:38.750
I'm moving out.

19:42.283 --> 19:44.550
Can I have her tires?

19:48.417 --> 19:49.950
Khadijah you
have to do something.

19:50.017 --> 19:51.850
Ragine just
offered me her room.

19:51.917 --> 19:55.250
She can't do that we're gonna
put the pool table there, right?

19:57.283 --> 19:59.250
Ragine is not going anywhere.

19:59.317 --> 20:00.857
She's just trying
to get attention.

20:00.923 --> 20:03.657
Yeah, well then what about
her suitcases by the door?

20:03.723 --> 20:07.390
Those are her stunt bags.

20:07.457 --> 20:08.957
Ah, Khadijah just so you know

20:09.023 --> 20:12.257
I put you as a credit reference
on my apartment application.

20:12.323 --> 20:14.223
Ah, no problem.

20:14.290 --> 20:17.723
Hey, I got some free time
if you need some help packing.

20:20.257 --> 20:22.723

it under control.

20:48.090 --> 20:51.190

a claim on the place, right?

20:51.257 --> 20:53.790
Cool , I'll take it.
No I‐I'll give you cash.
