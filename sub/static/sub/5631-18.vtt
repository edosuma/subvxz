00:01.102 --> 00:01.235
.

00:01.335 --> 00:02.170
- So you bust a sex party
and find a nun.

00:04.038 --> 00:07.608
- You saw who was there.
Politicians, police.

00:07.608 --> 00:09.677
- The johns, they must know
who threw the party.

00:09.677 --> 00:10.978
- They're not saying.

00:10.978 --> 00:13.013
Somebody knows how these girls
got caught up.

00:13.013 --> 00:16.584
- Is there someone at the school
we should be looking at?

00:16.584 --> 00:18.419
- What's the monsignor
doing here?

00:18.419 --> 00:20.554
- He has made some very serious
allegations against Tucker.

00:20.554 --> 00:22.556
- Sex trafficking,
corruption--

00:22.556 --> 00:24.258
- They really set me up good.
[cell phone buzzes]

00:24.258 --> 00:26.894
- 1PP wants to see me.

00:26.894 --> 00:28.496
- Lieutenant, what's going on?

00:28.496 --> 00:31.265
- I'm out,
effective immediately.

00:39.073 --> 00:41.041
male narrator:
In the criminal justice system,

00:41.041 --> 00:42.343
sexually based offenses

00:42.343 --> 00:44.745
are considered
especially heinous.

00:44.745 --> 00:47.014
In New York City,
the dedicated detectives

00:47.014 --> 00:48.782
who investigate
these vicious felonies

00:48.782 --> 00:50.351
are members of an elite squad

00:50.351 --> 00:52.520
known as
the Special Victims Unit.

00:52.520 --> 00:54.388
These are their stories.

00:55.923 --> 00:58.058
- I know having your lieutenant
transferred abruptly

00:58.058 --> 01:01.829
is unsettling,
but ours is not to reason why.

01:01.829 --> 01:04.365
- How long is Liv gonna be gone?

01:04.365 --> 01:05.833
- Best hope--temporarily.

01:05.833 --> 01:07.801
For now, keep doing your jobs.

01:07.801 --> 01:10.438
You're in good hands
with the sergeant here.

01:11.805 --> 01:15.209
- First off, I was as blindsided
by this as all of you,

01:15.209 --> 01:16.644
and second,

01:16.644 --> 01:19.980
I'm gonna need your help.

01:19.980 --> 01:22.483
- Copy that, Sergeant.
- What are we supposed to do?

01:22.483 --> 01:24.352
- Leads me to my third point.

01:24.352 --> 01:25.953
The lieutenant was recused

01:25.953 --> 01:27.721
because of the allegations
against Captain Tucker.

01:27.721 --> 01:29.490
- So what's that got
to do with Liv?

01:29.490 --> 01:32.660
- I can't speak to that,
and neither should any of you,

01:32.660 --> 01:34.228
but this is still our case,

01:34.228 --> 01:36.630
and since charges have been
made against Tucker,

01:36.630 --> 01:39.233
Barba's been pressuring us
to follow up on them,

01:39.233 --> 01:41.502
so start following up.

01:46.240 --> 01:48.376
- If Detectives
Russo and Jefferson

01:48.376 --> 01:51.645
claim they told me
about this ring, they're lying.

01:51.645 --> 01:54.515
I called them in
on a completely separate matter.

01:54.515 --> 01:55.916
- They're alleging
you blackmailed them

01:55.916 --> 01:57.518
into cutting you
in on the operation.

01:57.518 --> 01:58.819
- They're dirty.

01:58.819 --> 02:01.389
SVU busted them in the raid.

02:01.389 --> 02:04.458
Whosever running this thing
told them to blame me.

02:04.458 --> 02:07.195
- We have two priests, Captain,

02:07.195 --> 02:10.564
Father Eugene O'Hanigan
and Monsignor Patrick Mulregan,

02:10.564 --> 02:12.900
who confirm parts of the story.

02:12.900 --> 02:15.236
Are you saying they're in
on a conspiracy too?

02:15.236 --> 02:17.070
- I don't know.

02:17.070 --> 02:19.006
Father Eugene is my cousin,

02:19.006 --> 02:22.643
so...some of this
might be personal.

02:22.643 --> 02:25.346
There is a nun, though,
a Sister Nina Kelly.

02:25.346 --> 02:26.814
She suggested to me

02:26.814 --> 02:30.284
that Father Eugene
was somehow involved.

02:30.284 --> 02:32.253
Have you spoken to her yet?

02:32.253 --> 02:35.256
[tense music]

02:35.256 --> 02:43.397
*

02:53.874 --> 02:56.143
- Sister,
is anyone else coming?

02:56.143 --> 02:59.247
- Not today.
Just--just get in.

03:04.452 --> 03:05.853
- Barba.

03:05.853 --> 03:07.288
- We're not supposed
to be talking.

03:07.288 --> 03:08.622
- No?

03:08.622 --> 03:10.758
Did you know
that I was getting transferred?

03:10.758 --> 03:12.793
- 1PP doesn't keep
the DA's office apprised

03:12.793 --> 03:15.896
of its Byzantine maneuvers.
- No? Well, let me fill you in.

03:15.896 --> 03:18.266
You told them
about me and Tucker,

03:18.266 --> 03:20.634
and a few hours later
I'm getting pep talks

03:20.634 --> 03:22.303
about what a great asset
that I would be

03:22.303 --> 03:23.904
to women
in Community Affairs.

03:23.904 --> 03:25.306
- Liv, you're seeing someone
I'm investigating.

03:25.306 --> 03:26.740
1PP had to know.

03:26.740 --> 03:29.109
- Tucker is not
a sex trafficker.

03:29.109 --> 03:30.544
- Then the investigation
will clear him.

03:30.544 --> 03:32.413
Until it does,
just stay out of it.

03:32.413 --> 03:35.383
- Whoever's behind this
murdered Cara,

03:35.383 --> 03:39.487
and while you and 1PP
are chasing their Trojan horse,

03:39.487 --> 03:42.290
other girls are in danger.

03:42.290 --> 03:44.091
- We can't talk about this.

03:44.091 --> 03:45.459
- Wha--

03:46.760 --> 03:50.298
[cell phone rings]

03:50.298 --> 03:52.333
Hello?
- This is Nina.

03:52.333 --> 03:54.635
Did you tell them that
I'm not cooperating anymore?

03:54.635 --> 03:56.704
- Okay, Nina...
Nina, where are you?

03:56.704 --> 03:58.839
- Jus--just tell them
that I'm leaving town

03:58.839 --> 04:00.140
and that they don't have
to worry about me.

04:00.140 --> 04:02.310
- Wait, Nina, wait.
Listen to me--

04:02.310 --> 04:04.545
- I have to go.
- Nina, hold on--

04:04.545 --> 04:05.813
- Nina? Hello?

04:05.813 --> 04:08.816
[suspenseful music]

04:08.816 --> 04:16.857
*

04:39.413 --> 04:42.416
[dramatic music]

05:25.426 --> 05:25.559
.

05:27.795 --> 05:28.028
- Ed, hey.

05:30.297 --> 05:31.899
How are you holding up?

05:31.899 --> 05:33.901
- Group One's been grilling me
since 8:00 a.m.

05:33.901 --> 05:35.803
- They can't think
that you're in on this.

05:35.803 --> 05:38.205
- Oh, yeah, they can.
What do you got?

05:38.205 --> 05:39.973
- You need to be careful.

05:39.973 --> 05:43.411
Somebody's after Sister Nina,
and you might be next.

05:43.411 --> 05:44.645
- What are you talking about?

05:44.645 --> 05:46.847
- She called me this morning,
spooked,

05:46.847 --> 05:48.982
and now I can't reach her.

05:48.982 --> 05:50.851
Dodds is tracking her phone.

05:50.851 --> 05:54.021
- Great.
All right, keep me posted.

05:54.021 --> 05:56.023
Listen, I'm due back upstairs.

05:56.023 --> 05:59.860
More questions about
me and my cousin Eugene.

05:59.860 --> 06:01.662
*

06:01.662 --> 06:04.798
- Okay, I know
you can't violate any oaths,

06:04.798 --> 06:06.233
but when these girls
confessed to you--

06:06.233 --> 06:07.568
- I became concerned

06:07.568 --> 06:09.970
that the girls
were being preyed upon

06:09.970 --> 06:13.306
by the two vice cops,
and I suggested to the monsignor

06:13.306 --> 06:17.778
that he talk to my cousin
in Internal Affairs.

06:17.778 --> 06:19.513
- When was this?
- A year ago,

06:19.513 --> 06:21.615
March 14th--that's the date
of the letter

06:21.615 --> 06:24.017
I sent to Ed Tucker
outlining these crimes.

06:24.017 --> 06:26.019
- You still have that letter
on your computer?

06:26.019 --> 06:28.456
- I write by hand,
but I kept a photocopy

06:28.456 --> 06:30.491
if you'd like to see that.

06:30.491 --> 06:33.260
- Yeah, please.

06:33.260 --> 06:36.196
Yep, last March, hmm.

06:36.196 --> 06:38.198
And you--are you sure
he got this?

06:38.198 --> 06:40.668
I me--did you hear back
from Captain Tucker?

06:40.668 --> 06:43.203
- Tucker calls my partner
and I

06:43.203 --> 06:44.838
and says he wants to meet.

06:44.838 --> 06:47.808
- When was this?
- March 16th, last year.

06:47.808 --> 06:51.044
Here's a print out
of Detective Russo's calendar.

06:51.044 --> 06:53.280
- Was your lawyer or rep
with you?

06:53.280 --> 06:55.816
- No, Tucker said
that it was off the record,

06:55.816 --> 06:57.485
strictly for intel.

06:57.485 --> 07:00.287
So we go to--
- Wait just a minute.

07:00.287 --> 07:01.722
Let me make clear

07:01.722 --> 07:03.924
anything my client
says to implicate Tucker

07:03.924 --> 07:05.392
cannot be used against him.

07:05.392 --> 07:06.527
- Go on.

07:06.527 --> 07:07.928
- We go down.

07:07.928 --> 07:09.396
Tucker's there
without his partner,

07:09.396 --> 07:12.600
says he knows about us
and the girls

07:12.600 --> 07:15.102
and that it can go
one of two ways:

07:15.102 --> 07:18.906
We lose our badges
and we do some hard time,

07:18.906 --> 07:21.975
or we cut him in
on our action

07:21.975 --> 07:24.244
and he closes
this file out.

07:24.244 --> 07:26.279
- Do you have any way
to verify this?

07:26.279 --> 07:27.781
Were the meetings
with Tucker recorded?

07:27.781 --> 07:31.251
- No, it was Tucker,
my partner, and me.

07:31.251 --> 07:32.786
I told my captain
about it.

07:32.786 --> 07:34.955
[knocks on glass]

07:34.955 --> 07:37.758
- Yeah, give me a few minutes.

07:45.098 --> 07:46.934
That guy's got his story down.

07:46.934 --> 07:48.802
- Well, if Jefferson and Russo
met with Tucker,

07:48.802 --> 07:50.003
IAB is sure to have
a record of it.

07:50.003 --> 07:52.673
[door opens]
- Hey, Sergeant,

07:52.673 --> 07:55.075
this is a copy of the letter
the monsignor sent Tucker

07:55.075 --> 07:57.277
outing the vice cops.

07:57.277 --> 07:58.812
- Either Tucker's dirty

07:58.812 --> 08:00.548
or somebody's
setting him up good.

08:00.548 --> 08:02.215
- Okay, I'll give this
to Group One.

08:02.215 --> 08:04.017
Next problem,
the lieutenant called.

08:04.017 --> 08:05.753
Sister Nina might be in trouble,

08:05.753 --> 08:07.688
and her burner phone's
going straight to voicemail.

08:07.688 --> 08:09.156
- A burner--so no GPS.

08:09.156 --> 08:10.791
- TARU just triangulated.

08:10.791 --> 08:13.193
The last call came
from Saxon Woods.

08:13.193 --> 08:16.096
I got an emergency exception to
put a Triggerfish on her phone.

08:16.096 --> 08:18.098
If it's on, we'll find it.

08:18.098 --> 08:19.567
- Where was the last
call made from?

08:19.567 --> 08:21.902
- TARU said
less than a mile from here.

08:21.902 --> 08:23.571
- The minivan
is Nina Kelly's?

08:23.571 --> 08:25.873
- No, it belongs to
an Episcopal Church in Yonkers.

08:25.873 --> 08:27.174
I left word.

08:27.174 --> 08:30.043
- Can you call again?
- Sure.

08:30.043 --> 08:32.279
- Well, somebody
ran her off the road.

08:32.279 --> 08:35.448
- Yeah, and look.
You see these drag marks?

08:35.448 --> 08:37.450
Go over here
to the tire tracks.

08:37.450 --> 08:39.587
So they--they put her
in their vehicle

08:39.587 --> 08:41.221
and they took off.
- That's not good.

08:41.221 --> 08:43.924
- No.
- I got two suitcases.

08:47.394 --> 08:49.763
- It's women's clothes.

08:49.763 --> 08:51.832
This one is Nina's.

08:51.832 --> 08:55.402
[police radio chatter]

08:55.402 --> 08:58.639
And that one looks like
a teenage girl's, right?

08:58.639 --> 09:00.273
- So we got two vics.

09:00.273 --> 09:02.610
- Okay, church lady says
the van is usually driven

09:02.610 --> 09:05.613
by their reverend,
a Father Joseph Leahy.

09:05.613 --> 09:07.615
- Another priest?

09:07.615 --> 09:09.249
- You got to be kidding me.

09:12.185 --> 09:13.520
- Yes, that's our minivan.

09:13.520 --> 09:14.955
I loaned it to Nina
this morning.

09:14.955 --> 09:17.057
She said she was in trouble.
Is she okay?

09:17.057 --> 09:19.159
- Do you have any idea
where she was headed?

09:19.159 --> 09:21.795
- I gave her the keys to my
family's lake house in Vermont.

09:21.795 --> 09:23.697
- You did?

09:23.697 --> 09:25.833
All right, so you
two must be--must be close.

09:25.833 --> 09:27.400
Episcopalian reverend,
a Catholic nun.

09:27.400 --> 09:28.669
How'd you meet?

09:28.669 --> 09:30.470
- I used to be
a Catholic priest.

09:30.470 --> 09:33.506
That's when Nina and I, uh--

09:34.842 --> 09:37.310
- Became involved?

09:37.310 --> 09:39.146
- We were in love.

09:39.146 --> 09:41.548
I asked her to marry me,
to start a new life together.

09:41.548 --> 09:43.651
- But she turned you down?

09:43.651 --> 09:45.418
- She said she had
too much work to do.

09:45.418 --> 09:47.320
Girls were being abused.

09:47.320 --> 09:49.556
I asked her to stop,
but Nina's dogged.

09:49.556 --> 09:51.992
She never quits anything,
not even the Church.

09:51.992 --> 09:53.827
- When you gave her the keys
to the car,

09:53.827 --> 09:55.495
was she traveling alone?

09:55.495 --> 09:57.364
- She was very anxious
about the girls.

09:57.364 --> 09:59.532
I think she was trying
to get them out of town.

09:59.532 --> 10:01.434
- Okay, thank you.

10:01.434 --> 10:03.336
Margaret's at home.
Danielle is at the shelter.

10:03.336 --> 10:05.773
They said Nina called them,
but she wasn't making any sense.

10:05.773 --> 10:07.540
- Do you know which hospital
she went to?

10:07.540 --> 10:10.210
Okay, thank you.

10:10.210 --> 10:12.112
Natalia's foster mother
said Natalia left

10:12.112 --> 10:14.014
early this morning--
didn't say where she was going.

10:14.014 --> 10:17.517
- Now she's at the hospital?
- Yeah, she OD'd.

10:17.517 --> 10:20.187
- They should've just
let me die.

10:20.187 --> 10:22.055
I can't stop seeing her face.

10:22.055 --> 10:23.891
- Who, Sister Nina?

10:23.891 --> 10:26.593
- You're here
because you found her, right?

10:26.593 --> 10:29.797
- Right, but we need you
to tell us what happened.

10:29.797 --> 10:31.298
- No.

10:31.298 --> 10:33.133
He said he would do
the same thing to me.

10:33.133 --> 10:34.802
- "He"?
He who?

10:36.403 --> 10:40.040
Natalia, what we know--
that you were with Sister Nina

10:40.040 --> 10:41.541
when that van got rammed.

10:41.541 --> 10:43.243
- And you saw the driver.
- Right?

10:43.243 --> 10:45.045
What did he look like?

10:45.045 --> 10:47.280
- He was black.

10:47.280 --> 10:49.416
He was dressed like a priest.

10:49.416 --> 10:52.552
- Did he have an accent
when he talked to you?

10:52.552 --> 10:55.088
- African, I think.

10:55.088 --> 10:57.157
He forced Sister Nina and me
into his van,

10:57.157 --> 10:59.927
and he--he drove
into a dead end.

10:59.927 --> 11:03.964
- Mm-kay.
Go on.

11:03.964 --> 11:06.466
- He made us walk
into the woods,

11:06.466 --> 11:09.870
and, um, he said if I ran,

11:09.870 --> 11:12.339
he'd--he'd shoot her.

11:14.842 --> 11:17.644
Then he raped her.

11:17.644 --> 11:21.749
And when he was done,
he shot her anyway.

11:21.749 --> 11:23.550
He said I should tell
all the other girls that

11:23.550 --> 11:26.754
that's what would happen
to them if they talked.

11:26.754 --> 11:28.388
- And that's when you went
to score?

11:28.388 --> 11:30.657
- No, no, I didn't.

11:30.657 --> 11:33.393
He--he drove me
back to the Bronx,

11:33.393 --> 11:35.763
and he loaded that needle
in front of me,

11:35.763 --> 11:37.865
and he put it in my hand.

11:37.865 --> 11:41.101
He said,
"The Lord is my shepherd."

11:42.770 --> 11:45.773
Then I woke up here.

11:45.773 --> 11:46.774
[police radio chatter]

11:46.774 --> 11:48.108
- Tire tracks stop here.

11:48.108 --> 11:49.777
- Yeah, Natalia said
he pulled them both

11:49.777 --> 11:51.344
out of the car
and into the woods.

11:51.344 --> 11:53.246
- Can we get the dogs?

11:53.246 --> 11:56.249
[suspenseful music]

11:56.249 --> 12:04.357
*

12:11.364 --> 12:12.933
- Sergeant, they found her.

12:12.933 --> 12:14.334
Move.
Move!

12:14.334 --> 12:17.337
[somber music]

12:17.337 --> 12:23.343
*

12:23.343 --> 12:25.979
- All right, call it in.

12:28.816 --> 12:29.950
You know what?
Don't worry.

12:29.950 --> 12:31.551
I got it.

12:48.869 --> 12:49.002
.

12:50.470 --> 12:50.938
- I'm sorry, Lieutenant.

12:52.505 --> 12:54.707
- Sister Nina
wasn't paranoid at all.

12:54.707 --> 12:57.978
She was right.
What did the M.E. say?

12:57.978 --> 13:00.213
- She confirmed
what Natalia told us.

13:00.213 --> 13:02.515
Sister Nina was raped

13:02.515 --> 13:06.286
and shot point-blank.

13:06.286 --> 13:08.555
- And Natalia ID'd
Father Akintola?

13:08.555 --> 13:10.190
- Yeah, picked him
out of a photo array.

13:10.190 --> 13:11.724
Said he was wearing
his priest collar.

13:11.724 --> 13:13.326
- Where is he now?

13:13.326 --> 13:14.995
- Maybe in the wind,

13:14.995 --> 13:16.663
and nobody at St. Fabiola's
is returning our calls.

13:16.663 --> 13:18.298
- Of course they're not.

13:18.298 --> 13:20.633
Go and sit outside
their offices

13:20.633 --> 13:23.070
for as long as it takes.

13:23.070 --> 13:26.073
[dramatic music]

13:26.073 --> 13:30.710
*

13:30.710 --> 13:32.745
- Sister, any word?

13:32.745 --> 13:35.215
- I'm sorry.
It looks like the monsignor

13:35.215 --> 13:37.517
won't be coming in today
after all.

13:37.517 --> 13:39.652
- I-I thought you said
he was already here.

13:39.652 --> 13:41.088
I've been waiting
since 9:00.

13:41.088 --> 13:43.390
- Oh, you must have
misunderstood.

13:43.390 --> 13:46.559
He's in seclusion,
praying for Nina.

13:46.559 --> 13:48.395
- Monsignor Mulregan
finally called me back.

13:48.395 --> 13:50.697
He thinks Father Akintola's
out of the country.

13:50.697 --> 13:52.499
- Out of the country?

13:52.499 --> 13:54.434
- He believes the Father had
a family emergency in Cameroon

13:54.434 --> 13:56.336
three days ago.

13:56.336 --> 13:58.071
- What about Father Eugene?

13:58.071 --> 14:01.108
- Isn't he in school today?
- No, no, he's not.

14:01.108 --> 14:04.011
Sister, please, this is about
getting justice for Nina.

14:04.011 --> 14:05.946
- I understand,
but we've been told

14:05.946 --> 14:07.214
for the good of the church

14:07.214 --> 14:09.516
that it's best
not to answer any questions.

14:09.516 --> 14:11.919
- Well, who told you that?
- The monsignor.

14:11.919 --> 14:14.287
He reminded us that God's plan

14:14.287 --> 14:17.624
will be unveiled with time.

14:17.624 --> 14:19.159
- Does the monsignor

14:19.159 --> 14:21.794
know how to get
in touch with Father Akintola?

14:21.794 --> 14:25.632
- No, but Bishop Catalano
might know more.

14:25.632 --> 14:28.035
- I've been here all day.
No sign of the bishop.

14:28.035 --> 14:30.437
He's got to come in or out
at some point.

14:30.437 --> 14:32.973
Hold on--call you back.

14:37.044 --> 14:38.311
How you doing?

14:38.311 --> 14:40.480
I'm trying
to reach Bishop Catalano.

14:40.480 --> 14:42.682
- I'm sorry, Officer,
this is not a good time.

14:42.682 --> 14:44.284
- You're the bishop, aren't you?

14:44.284 --> 14:46.319
I'm looking for Father Akintola.

14:46.319 --> 14:48.655
- Call my secretary,
and she'll take care of you.

14:48.655 --> 14:50.457
- Can I please talk to you
for five minutes?

14:50.457 --> 14:53.860
- Please, we have a funeral mass
to attend to.

14:53.860 --> 15:01.501
*

15:01.501 --> 15:03.503
- Huh.
Horrifying.

15:03.503 --> 15:05.772
And no one in the church
knows where Akintola is?

15:05.772 --> 15:08.275
- Nah, they're in seclusion.
- On full lockdown.

15:08.275 --> 15:10.543
- Not available,
not returning calls.

15:10.543 --> 15:12.545
I assume you don't want us
to bust down the rectory door

15:12.545 --> 15:14.281
and haul 'em in.
- They assume that too.

15:14.281 --> 15:16.816
- Well, Monsignor did send word
through Sister Ida

15:16.816 --> 15:18.251
that he'd heard Akintola

15:18.251 --> 15:19.752
went back to Cameroon
three days ago.

15:19.752 --> 15:20.988
- Then when you met with him,
did he mention

15:20.988 --> 15:22.422
anything about a flight?

15:22.422 --> 15:23.991
- I'm not sure
he actually took one.

15:23.991 --> 15:25.825
ICE has no record
of him leaving the country

15:25.825 --> 15:27.727
on a commercial
or private flight.

15:27.727 --> 15:29.796
- Yeah, and there's no record
of him coming into the country.

15:29.796 --> 15:31.164
All right, we're out
to the FBI and Interpol,

15:31.164 --> 15:32.599
but this guy could be anywhere

15:32.599 --> 15:34.101
or anyone in the world
right now.

15:34.101 --> 15:36.469
- Okay, all right,
identity issues aside,

15:36.469 --> 15:39.739
he was the priest who met
with Cara right before she OD'd?

15:39.739 --> 15:42.775
- Yep, and Natalia told us,
after he drove her to the Bronx,

15:42.775 --> 15:44.811
he gave her the syringe
she OD'd with.

15:44.811 --> 15:46.679
- Whoever the players are
in this,

15:46.679 --> 15:48.748
they are closing ranks fast.

15:48.748 --> 15:51.684
- And killing Sister Nina like
that, they're sending a message.

15:51.684 --> 15:53.186
- All right,
where are you on the warrants

15:53.186 --> 15:54.854
for the priests' financials?

15:54.854 --> 15:56.489
- As of last count,
I have three judges

15:56.489 --> 15:58.358
not getting back to me.
- What do you expect?

15:58.358 --> 16:00.027
No judge wants to take
on the Church.

16:00.027 --> 16:01.694
- Well, hang on.

16:01.694 --> 16:04.264
What about this guy?
- Judge Wheeler?

16:04.264 --> 16:05.732
He still maintains
he thought the sex party

16:05.732 --> 16:07.334
was a fundraiser.
- Oh, yeah?

16:07.334 --> 16:08.935
Well, I still
have surveillance photos

16:08.935 --> 16:12.039
of this guy groping
a 16-year-old girl on his lap.

16:14.041 --> 16:15.542
- This is blackmail.

16:15.542 --> 16:17.510
- More like a courtesy call.
- Yeah.

16:17.510 --> 16:19.179
You see, Your Honor,
with the death of that nun,

16:19.179 --> 16:20.947
the press is all over us,

16:20.947 --> 16:23.883
so if photos like that were to,
God forbid, leak out--

16:23.883 --> 16:25.952
- I never had any contact
with a nun.

16:25.952 --> 16:28.121
- Yes, you did.

16:28.121 --> 16:29.622
That's her right there,
serving you a drink.

16:29.622 --> 16:31.191
- Yeah,
maybe you didn't notice her

16:31.191 --> 16:34.294
with that, uh, underage girl
sitting on your lap there.

16:34.294 --> 16:35.895
- I can't get you warrants

16:35.895 --> 16:38.065
for half the priests
in the Archdiocese.

16:38.065 --> 16:39.932
- All right, well,
start with these four:

16:39.932 --> 16:42.569
Akintola, Eugene O'Hanigan,
Monsignor Mulregan--

16:42.569 --> 16:43.703
- Bishop Catalano?
- Mm-hmm.

16:43.703 --> 16:47.074
- You must be joking.

16:47.074 --> 16:48.975
You know, it's my signature
on these warrants.

16:48.975 --> 16:51.878
- No, not yours.

16:51.878 --> 16:53.313
You're gonna get one
of your judge friends

16:53.313 --> 16:55.448
to do it for you.

16:55.448 --> 16:57.284
- No financials
at all for Father Akintola?

16:57.284 --> 16:58.585
- If he even is a priest.

16:58.585 --> 17:00.487
The Archdiocese
has no record of him.

17:00.487 --> 17:01.988
- What about Monsignor Mulregan?

17:01.988 --> 17:04.557
- No extra accounts,
no car leases, credit cards.

17:04.557 --> 17:06.826
This guy's good
at hiding his profits.

17:06.826 --> 17:08.795
- Yeah, or he's actually
just a good priest

17:08.795 --> 17:10.097
who has nothing to do
with this.

17:10.097 --> 17:11.464
- And Father Eugene?

17:11.464 --> 17:13.200
- I may have something.

17:13.200 --> 17:16.736
Father Eugene is paying $600
a month for a Bronx walk-up,

17:16.736 --> 17:18.538
and he's also renting a loft

17:18.538 --> 17:21.308
in Fort Greene for $3,500.
- $3,500?

17:21.308 --> 17:23.376
His salary's $2,500 a month.
That doesn't add up.

17:23.376 --> 17:25.412
- Does if he's part of
this ring.

17:25.412 --> 17:27.580
- Maybe this loft's
another party location.

17:27.580 --> 17:29.482
Rollins, keep digging
into his accounts.

17:29.482 --> 17:32.419
Fin and Carisi, go check out
Father Eugene's loft.

17:32.419 --> 17:35.021
*

17:35.021 --> 17:37.490
- E. O'Hanigan--number three.
- His name's on the door?

17:37.490 --> 17:38.658
That's brazen.

17:38.658 --> 17:41.494
[intercom rings]

17:41.494 --> 17:43.763
- Hello?
- Uh, yeah, this is UPS.

17:43.763 --> 17:46.633
We have a package here
for a Eugene O'Hanigan.

17:48.401 --> 17:50.002
[door buzzes]

17:54.374 --> 17:56.276
- Oh.

17:56.276 --> 17:58.611
Oh, you're not the UPS guy.

17:58.611 --> 18:00.580
- And you're not
Father Eugene.

18:00.580 --> 18:02.849
- What's your name, cowboy?

18:02.849 --> 18:05.685
- Lance...uh, Woodstone.

18:05.685 --> 18:07.154
Eugene's not here, though.

18:07.154 --> 18:08.655
- Mind if we come in, Lance?

18:08.655 --> 18:11.658
- Uh, yeah, yeah.

18:18.931 --> 18:22.369
- So you must be
Father Eugene's...

18:22.369 --> 18:24.337
- Personal trainer.
- Oh?

18:24.337 --> 18:26.673
- CrossFit, Pilates--

18:26.673 --> 18:28.575
- Use this ball gag
in Pilates?

18:28.575 --> 18:30.277
- We're gonna need
you to come down to the station

18:30.277 --> 18:31.544
with us, Lance.

18:31.544 --> 18:34.181
- Um, do I have to?

18:34.181 --> 18:36.549
- Well, most good citizens
like to cooperate

18:36.549 --> 18:40.220
when the police seek their help.

18:40.220 --> 18:43.290
- Yeah, I know he's a priest,
but he likes to stay in shape.

18:43.290 --> 18:45.192
- You been living
in that loft full-time?

18:45.192 --> 18:46.359
- Yeah.

18:46.359 --> 18:49.196
- Pay rent--expenses?

18:49.196 --> 18:51.331
- Yeah, I chip in.

18:51.331 --> 18:53.400
- Lance Woodstone, 25,

18:53.400 --> 18:55.202
has an outstanding
DUI warrant

18:55.202 --> 18:57.204
and claims to be
a personal trainer.

18:57.204 --> 18:59.539
- Any other clients?
- No, but he does seem

18:59.539 --> 19:02.309
to spend over $1,000 a month
in liquor deliveries,

19:02.309 --> 19:05.278
plus another $500 a month
on gift items

19:05.278 --> 19:09.048
from the, um,
the Pirate Booty Treasure Chest.

19:09.048 --> 19:10.983
- Huh.

19:10.983 --> 19:13.920
- Lance, how long
you been training Father Eugene?

19:13.920 --> 19:15.988
- On and off, a few years.

19:15.988 --> 19:18.725
- On and off?
Uh-huh.

19:18.725 --> 19:22.094
- Look,
can I call my girlfriend?

19:22.094 --> 19:24.931
Um, she's a lawyer.

19:28.235 --> 19:29.302
- You're Lance Woodstone's
attorney?

19:29.302 --> 19:30.737
I haven't met you before,
Counselor.

19:30.737 --> 19:33.406
- Heidi Aronson.
I'm a real estate attorney--

19:33.406 --> 19:35.808
well, broker, but I have
some legal experience.

19:35.808 --> 19:38.110
- And you're Lance's girlfriend?

19:38.110 --> 19:39.679
- I'm also married.

19:39.679 --> 19:41.348
What's relevant here
is he's my client,

19:41.348 --> 19:43.082
and I'd like to know
why you're holding him.

19:43.082 --> 19:45.785
- For questioning about
his dealings with the Church.

19:45.785 --> 19:47.287
- Is this about
Father Eugene?

19:47.287 --> 19:48.455
Lance hasn't had
anything to do

19:48.455 --> 19:49.856
with that priest
for over a year.

19:49.856 --> 19:51.658
- Are you sure about that?
- Yes.

19:51.658 --> 19:54.261
I told him if he kept up that
sick relationship, we were over.

19:54.261 --> 19:55.528
- You did?

19:55.528 --> 19:57.797
'Cause Lance has been
living in a loft

19:57.797 --> 19:59.532
that Father Eugene
pays the rent for.

19:59.532 --> 20:02.168
- That son of a bitch.

20:02.168 --> 20:04.471
I emailed the monsignor
about him two years ago.

20:04.471 --> 20:06.172
- Monsignor Mulregan?
- Yes.

20:06.172 --> 20:08.808
I told him Father Eugene was
stealing money from the church

20:08.808 --> 20:10.643
to fund his deviant lifestyle.

20:10.643 --> 20:12.345
- What do you mean by "deviant"?

20:12.345 --> 20:13.980
- Here.

20:13.980 --> 20:16.849
The good Father made
a whole series like this

20:16.849 --> 20:19.719
on the church altar.

20:31.398 --> 20:31.531
.

20:32.632 --> 20:33.433
- I knew Eugene was
hiding something.

20:34.834 --> 20:37.236
- This trainer--
Eugene is his sugar daddy?

20:37.236 --> 20:40.640
- Pays for his loft,
his credit cards, S&M purchases.

20:40.640 --> 20:42.174
- And he's getting the money
from the trafficking ring?

20:42.174 --> 20:43.343
- We haven't been able
to track the cash,

20:43.343 --> 20:44.711
but that's our working
theory.

20:44.711 --> 20:46.313
- You're sure
that the monsignor knew?

20:46.313 --> 20:47.914
- Yeah, we are.
Now, it turns out

20:47.914 --> 20:49.749
that Lance also had a sugar mama

20:49.749 --> 20:51.918
who found out
about him and Eugene.

20:51.918 --> 20:53.553
Here's a copy
of the outraged email

20:53.553 --> 20:55.054
that she sent
to Monsignor Mulregan

20:55.054 --> 20:56.689
two years ago.

20:56.689 --> 20:58.391
- Giving him leverage
over Eugene.

20:58.391 --> 21:01.961
- And the vice cops,
Jefferson and Russo.

21:01.961 --> 21:03.963
He knew that
they were raping his girls,

21:03.963 --> 21:06.633
so he gets them
and Eugene to frame you.

21:06.633 --> 21:08.234
- Now, the problem is,

21:08.234 --> 21:10.403
you actually met with Russo
and Jefferson last year.

21:10.403 --> 21:12.772
- I did, yeah, on a completely
unrelated matter.

21:12.772 --> 21:14.907
A pimp accused them of
shaking down his girls.

21:14.907 --> 21:16.743
- Did you record
the conversation?

21:16.743 --> 21:17.844
- No.

21:17.844 --> 21:19.512
This pimp had accused
half the NYPD.

21:19.512 --> 21:20.847
It was pro forma,

21:20.847 --> 21:22.915
and my partner
was out sick that day.

21:22.915 --> 21:24.517
- Then it's your word
against Vice

21:24.517 --> 21:27.854
and the Catholic Church.

21:27.854 --> 21:30.357
- At least we know why
my cousin is lying.

21:30.357 --> 21:32.091
You bring him in,
show him those pictures.

21:32.091 --> 21:33.693
- That's easier said than done.

21:33.693 --> 21:35.795
Everyone at St. Fabiola's
has gone to ground.

21:35.795 --> 21:37.830
- They have?

21:37.830 --> 21:40.667
Well, then I assume
that Eugene doesn't know

21:40.667 --> 21:43.703
that you have his trainer.

21:45.905 --> 21:47.607
- You're late.
- I'm sorry.

21:47.607 --> 21:49.609
I'm sorry.

21:49.609 --> 21:52.712
There's a lot going on.

21:52.712 --> 21:55.782
- On the floor,
you filthy bitch!

21:55.782 --> 21:58.885
You have some respect
for your master.

21:58.885 --> 22:00.953
- Forgive me, sir.
May--may I come closer?

22:00.953 --> 22:02.522
- Eugene, stand up.

22:06.526 --> 22:08.060
- They made me.

22:08.060 --> 22:10.229
They were gonna give me
a year on that DUI.

22:10.229 --> 22:13.566
- Lance, go put on
some clothes, now.

22:13.566 --> 22:15.968
- What are you doing here?

22:15.968 --> 22:17.404
This is a private residence.

22:17.404 --> 22:18.738
- Well,
there's been allegations

22:18.738 --> 22:20.640
that you've illegally
been using church funds

22:20.640 --> 22:22.208
to pay for this
private residence, Father.

22:22.208 --> 22:23.576
- Am I under arrest?

22:23.576 --> 22:25.578
- We have some questions
for you,

22:25.578 --> 22:26.879
or we could just
call your monsignor,

22:26.879 --> 22:28.781
let him know we caught you
in a honey trap.

22:28.781 --> 22:32.752
- No, don't...do that.

22:32.752 --> 22:35.121
*

22:35.121 --> 22:37.256
Those photos are from my past.

22:37.256 --> 22:38.758
- Really?

22:38.758 --> 22:41.494
Because we just caught you
getting dommed

22:41.494 --> 22:44.063
by, uh, Lance Woodstone.

22:44.063 --> 22:46.999
- If you did,
that would be a private matter.

22:46.999 --> 22:48.300
- Not if you're paying
for it with funds

22:48.300 --> 22:49.736
from a sex trafficking ring.

22:49.736 --> 22:51.504
- How could you even
think such a thing?

22:51.504 --> 22:52.905
- How?
I don't know.

22:52.905 --> 22:54.807
Loft rent we got here,

22:54.807 --> 22:57.910
cognac bills, sex toys,
Internet porn--

22:57.910 --> 22:59.178
- You--you went through
my personal finances.

22:59.178 --> 23:00.780
- Yeah.
- You want to tell us

23:00.780 --> 23:02.248
how you can afford
this double life

23:02.248 --> 23:03.450
on a priest's salary?

23:03.450 --> 23:04.551
- I didn't do anything illegal.

23:04.551 --> 23:06.753
I-I sold family heirlooms

23:06.753 --> 23:09.589
to pay for my sessions.

23:09.589 --> 23:11.724
I'm a good man struggling
with some demons.

23:11.724 --> 23:14.226
- Father, cut the crap.

23:14.226 --> 23:15.895
You know why you're here.

23:15.895 --> 23:18.230
Girls from your school
have been raped and murdered,

23:18.230 --> 23:20.767
and so has a nun.
Now, what happened?

23:20.767 --> 23:23.035
Did those vice cops find out
about your demons

23:23.035 --> 23:24.537
and get you to run
those girls for them?

23:24.537 --> 23:26.839
- No, no, I already told you,

23:26.839 --> 23:28.575
my cousin's behind that evil,

23:28.575 --> 23:30.543
and I was not involved
in any way,

23:30.543 --> 23:32.044
nor was anyone I know.

23:32.044 --> 23:34.013
- The girls attended
his school.

23:34.013 --> 23:37.183
He has an unexplained
cash flow...

23:37.183 --> 23:39.051
yet he still blames Tucker.

23:39.051 --> 23:41.688
He and the monsignor are
in on this up to their eyeballs.

23:41.688 --> 23:44.023
- Yeah, him, sure,
but the monsignor?

23:44.023 --> 23:47.393
- Carisi, the monsignor
came to me, unsolicited,

23:47.393 --> 23:49.128
to dirty Tucker up.

23:49.128 --> 23:50.963
He then handed you,
the good Catholic,

23:50.963 --> 23:52.765
a photocopy
of a handwritten letter.

23:52.765 --> 23:55.067
- Which, obviously,
anybody could've backdated

23:55.067 --> 23:56.969
and claimed they mailed--I mean,
I knew that was a possibility,

23:56.969 --> 23:59.238
but...

24:03.676 --> 24:07.046
But I guess I just wouldn't
let myself believe it.

24:07.046 --> 24:08.981
- He came to my office
full of righteous anger

24:08.981 --> 24:11.017
and lied to my face,

24:11.017 --> 24:13.285
and I doubted myself
for doubting him.

24:13.285 --> 24:15.522
I have no idea
how he sustains his act.

24:17.790 --> 24:20.527
- It's all for the good
of the church.

24:20.527 --> 24:22.529
- Excuse me?
- Sister Antonia told me

24:22.529 --> 24:25.532
the monsignor instructed
everybody to stonewall...

24:25.532 --> 24:27.634
- For the good
of the church.

24:27.634 --> 24:30.302
Okay, well, then, maybe
for the good of the church,

24:30.302 --> 24:31.904
we should give the monsignor
a heads-up

24:31.904 --> 24:35.842
that Fathers Eugene and Akintola
are about to be indicted.

24:37.677 --> 24:38.878
- How did you get this?

24:38.878 --> 24:40.112
- That's not the issue,
Monsignor.

24:40.112 --> 24:42.549
Did you receive that email
from Heidi Aronson?

24:42.549 --> 24:44.551
- Yes,
but it was over two years ago.

24:44.551 --> 24:46.553
- So you read the part
about Father Eugene

24:46.553 --> 24:48.921
skimming money
from the school uniform fund

24:48.921 --> 24:51.357
to pay for
his altar bondage play?

24:51.357 --> 24:54.694
- Yes, and I was
deeply disturbed by it.

24:54.694 --> 24:57.329
- Oh, you were?
Did you take any action?

24:57.329 --> 24:59.899
- I confronted Father Eugene
right away.

24:59.899 --> 25:02.468
He went on sabbatical
to deal with the sickness,

25:02.468 --> 25:03.836
and I asked the Archdiocese

25:03.836 --> 25:05.638
to investigate
Ms. Aronson's allegations

25:05.638 --> 25:07.106
that he'd misappropriated
funds,

25:07.106 --> 25:10.910
but that claim proved
to be baseless.

25:10.910 --> 25:12.912
- You sure about that?
- Yes.

25:12.912 --> 25:16.082
I even forwarded her email
to the Bronx D.A.'s office.

25:16.082 --> 25:18.417
He assured me that nothing
criminal had taken place.

25:18.417 --> 25:22.354
- And yet, you let Father Eugene
continue to guide students.

25:22.354 --> 25:24.490
- Well, why wouldn't I?

25:24.490 --> 25:27.794
Father Eugene
confessed his sins.

25:27.794 --> 25:29.996
He did a rigorous soul-search,
and he's--

25:29.996 --> 25:32.098
- And he's still
paying $5,000 a month

25:32.098 --> 25:34.601
to be disciplined
by his naked cowboy.

25:38.470 --> 25:40.306
- [stammering]
I'm at a loss for words.

25:40.306 --> 25:43.209
If-if this is true--
- It's true, and you knew it,

25:43.209 --> 25:44.811
and that's how you got him
to procure girls

25:44.811 --> 25:46.145
for you to traffic.

25:46.145 --> 25:47.947
To frame Tucker
for your crimes.

25:47.947 --> 25:50.282
- No.

25:50.282 --> 25:54.320
No, you've got this all wrong.

25:54.320 --> 25:56.789
I know what you think
of the Catholic Church,

25:56.789 --> 25:58.825
but it's NYPD officers

25:58.825 --> 26:02.261
who were trafficking
these girls.

26:02.261 --> 26:03.996
- Monsignor, please.

26:03.996 --> 26:07.033
These girls' lives
are being destroyed,

26:07.033 --> 26:09.135
and if you know something
about this, come clean.

26:09.135 --> 26:11.370
- Come clean?
How dare you say that to me.

26:11.370 --> 26:14.540
I have been
to a Bronx ADA, IAB, SVU,

26:14.540 --> 26:19.278
and the result: Sister Nina
and young Cara are dead.

26:19.278 --> 26:21.213
The cancer isn't in my church.

26:21.213 --> 26:24.784
It's within you...

26:24.784 --> 26:28.655
and I will not rest
until it's been excised.

26:31.557 --> 26:34.426
[door opens and closes]

26:35.394 --> 26:37.429
- [sighs]

26:39.398 --> 26:41.300
- Now what was the name
of that Bronx ADA

26:41.300 --> 26:42.902
Monsignor sent that email
to about Eugene?

26:42.902 --> 26:44.136
- Joel Winn.

26:44.136 --> 26:46.272
He was a regular
at the floating parties.

26:46.272 --> 26:49.575
He was--we picked him up
on the initial sting.

26:49.575 --> 26:51.277
- That's how the powers that be

26:51.277 --> 26:52.679
have survived
thousands of scandals

26:52.679 --> 26:54.146
over hundreds of years.
[cell phone buzzes]

26:54.146 --> 26:55.682
There's not a move
in the playbook

26:55.682 --> 26:57.016
they don't have
at least a dozen defenses for.

26:57.016 --> 26:58.250
- Hold on.
Here's another one.

26:58.250 --> 27:00.086
Excuse me.
Turn on the news, please.

27:03.022 --> 27:04.390
Thank you.
- It is with a heavy heart

27:04.390 --> 27:07.827
that we find ourselves
here today,

27:07.827 --> 27:09.996
to make public

27:09.996 --> 27:12.031
a deeply disturbing scandal

27:12.031 --> 27:14.066
that involves a member
of my own parish,

27:14.066 --> 27:16.402
Father Eugene O'Hanigan.

27:16.402 --> 27:18.170
We've learned
that Father O'Hanigan

27:18.170 --> 27:19.571
has betrayed his vows

27:19.571 --> 27:21.207
by committing sins
of the flesh.

27:21.207 --> 27:24.543
More troubling still,

27:24.543 --> 27:28.247
we believe that members
of the NYPD Vice Squad

27:28.247 --> 27:30.516
and Internal Affairs Bureau,

27:30.516 --> 27:33.786
after becoming aware
of his transgressions,

27:33.786 --> 27:36.388
blackmailed Father Eugene

27:36.388 --> 27:41.427
into helping them traffic
troubled girls from our school.

27:41.427 --> 27:45.131
- It's the scorched earth
defense.

27:45.131 --> 27:47.599
I almost feel sorry
for Eugene.

27:55.775 --> 27:55.908
.

27:56.743 --> 27:57.744
- We believe these police
officers are responsible

27:59.145 --> 28:01.113
for the death
of one of the girls,

28:01.113 --> 28:03.215
as well as Sister Nina Kelly.

28:03.215 --> 28:05.384
The ring's hooks run deep,

28:05.384 --> 28:07.186
not just into NYPD

28:07.186 --> 28:10.389
but the Bronx D.A.'s office,
the City Council,

28:10.389 --> 28:11.958
and the State Assembly as well.

28:11.958 --> 28:14.193
Bishop Catalano.

28:17.864 --> 28:20.532
- Today we ask the
federal government to step in

28:20.532 --> 28:22.969
and take this
investigation away

28:22.969 --> 28:26.138
from the city's corrupt
judicial system.

28:26.138 --> 28:29.976
We will fully cooperate
with complete transparency.

28:29.976 --> 28:33.412
Our goal is justice
for these girls.

28:33.412 --> 28:37.917
Words cannot express
my sorrow for the abuse

28:37.917 --> 28:40.820
our precious children of God

28:40.820 --> 28:43.522
have suffered.

28:43.522 --> 28:44.857
- You're lucky.

28:44.857 --> 28:46.859
As of now,
you're not bloodied up.

28:46.859 --> 28:48.795
Quit while you're ahead.

28:48.795 --> 28:51.530
- What, you mean stand down?

28:51.530 --> 28:53.432
The monsignor's the one
who was running this ring.

28:53.432 --> 28:56.803
He had his own priest
put a hit out on Sister Nina.

28:56.803 --> 28:58.037
- The one from West Africa?

28:58.037 --> 29:00.506
They'll claim
he was a rogue thug.

29:00.506 --> 29:01.808
- All right,

29:01.808 --> 29:03.810
what happens
to the Vice detectives?

29:03.810 --> 29:06.645
- No judge, cop,
or ADA's going to jail

29:06.645 --> 29:09.315
for seeing a hooker.
They'll plead out.

29:09.315 --> 29:12.451
Now, Father Eugene,
the Church will send him

29:12.451 --> 29:14.286
to some sanatorium
on the Isle of Skye

29:14.286 --> 29:16.322
to work on his
anxiety issues.

29:16.322 --> 29:19.959
- And Tucker?

29:19.959 --> 29:23.029
- Collateral damage.

29:23.029 --> 29:25.097
- You do know he's clean.

29:25.097 --> 29:27.333
- He went to see his cousin,
by himself,

29:27.333 --> 29:29.936
and told him the name
of the girl who was cooperating.

29:29.936 --> 29:32.604
She'd be alive
if he weren't so stupid.

29:32.604 --> 29:35.474
- So he's under the bus now too?

29:35.474 --> 29:37.676
The hierarchy calls,
everybody backs off,

29:37.676 --> 29:40.980
and it's all just taken care of.

29:40.980 --> 29:45.117
- Do you have any idea how much
heat there was even before this?

29:45.117 --> 29:47.719
It's a career-killer.

29:47.719 --> 29:50.322
Walk away.

29:51.690 --> 29:52.859
[knock on door]

29:54.560 --> 29:55.727
- Hi.

29:58.865 --> 30:02.068
- In the spirit of transparency,
my father has made it clear

30:02.068 --> 30:04.236
that he's willing
to throw you both under the bus.

30:04.236 --> 30:05.671
- Oh, yeah?
Are you driving it?

30:05.671 --> 30:07.306
- Ed, he called us.

30:07.306 --> 30:09.008
- He did say that you brought
this on yourself,

30:09.008 --> 30:10.242
meeting with the Vice cops

30:10.242 --> 30:12.211
and Father Eugene
without your partner.

30:12.211 --> 30:13.545
- Well, that's always been
your father's

30:13.545 --> 30:15.181
one great strength, you know?

30:15.181 --> 30:16.748
No one knows how to cover
their ass like he does.

30:16.748 --> 30:19.518
- How about we focus
on where we go from here?

30:21.820 --> 30:24.190
- I'm open to anything.

30:24.190 --> 30:25.757
- When we met with Eugene,

30:25.757 --> 30:29.661
I saw a man that was close
to his breaking point.

30:29.661 --> 30:33.399
- And that was before they outed
him at the press conference.

30:33.399 --> 30:35.367
Maybe he's ready
to save himself.

30:35.367 --> 30:37.169
- He'll never
turn on the Church.

30:37.169 --> 30:39.438
It's the only employer
he's ever had.

30:42.074 --> 30:43.442
- Then I don't know
what to tell you.

30:43.442 --> 30:46.312
Enjoy being on the rack
at Group One.

30:48.847 --> 30:52.051
- But you got to love
the irony, though, huh?

30:52.051 --> 30:54.220
All these years, telling cops
to put in their papers

30:54.220 --> 30:56.255
before charges get filed...

30:56.255 --> 30:58.925
now it's my turn.

31:00.759 --> 31:03.829
- Bottom line:
Tucker takes early retirement,

31:03.829 --> 31:06.933
the Vice cops take a misdemeanor
sexual misconduct plea,

31:06.933 --> 31:09.101
and, with any luck,
Benson gets her office back.

31:09.101 --> 31:11.503
- Okay, and what about
these priests, the monsignor?

31:11.503 --> 31:14.340
They just get away with it
and you're all right with that?

31:14.340 --> 31:16.342
- No, but the brass
says this is over,

31:16.342 --> 31:18.444
and so is SVU
if we keep looking into it.

31:18.444 --> 31:20.312
- And what about
Sister Nina's murder?

31:20.312 --> 31:22.814
We have an eyewitness
that saw her get shot.

31:22.814 --> 31:24.550
- Interpol is looking
for Akintola,

31:24.550 --> 31:25.985
and there's a warrant
out for his arrest.

31:25.985 --> 31:27.486
- And Father Eugene?

31:27.486 --> 31:31.123
- He is aware of the severity
of his wrongdoings.

31:31.123 --> 31:32.824
He's repentant,

31:32.824 --> 31:34.826
and they're making plans
to send him far away.

31:34.826 --> 31:38.030
- No, they hung this guy
out to dry, all right?

31:38.030 --> 31:39.465
The least we can do
for these girls

31:39.465 --> 31:41.400
is take one more run at him.

31:41.400 --> 31:43.669
- Tucker says there's no point.

31:43.669 --> 31:46.538
His cousin doesn't have
a soul to save.

31:57.116 --> 32:00.586
[bell tolls distantly]

32:09.228 --> 32:11.797
- Father?

32:11.797 --> 32:13.565
- What are you doing here?
Get out.

32:13.565 --> 32:14.900
- Wait, please.

32:14.900 --> 32:17.136
- I have nothing
to say to you or anyone.

32:17.136 --> 32:18.504
- Father, I'm a Catholic,

32:18.504 --> 32:21.773
and I have something
I need to say to you.

32:21.773 --> 32:25.811
Do you think you could
listen to me, please?

32:25.811 --> 32:28.814
I was born and raised
in the Church.

32:28.814 --> 32:32.184
I got two cousins
who, uh, who are priests.

32:32.184 --> 32:34.920
I even thought that
I'd become one myself.

32:34.920 --> 32:38.257
To me, there was
no higher calling.

32:38.257 --> 32:40.426
- Mm, mm.
Then I can imagine

32:40.426 --> 32:43.095
what you must think
of the Church and me.

32:43.095 --> 32:46.532
- No.
No, you can't.

32:46.532 --> 32:50.169
I still go to Mass
every Sunday.

32:50.169 --> 32:52.838
During this case,
I've been doing twice a week.

32:55.941 --> 32:57.443
- What is it you want?

32:57.443 --> 33:02.081
- I want you to think
about Eugene as a kid,

33:02.081 --> 33:04.883
about why you wanted
to become a priest

33:04.883 --> 33:07.586
in the first place.

33:07.586 --> 33:11.557
- Those memories...
[murmurs]

33:11.557 --> 33:13.225
they're lost to me.

33:13.225 --> 33:16.328
- No.
I saw you praying, Father.

33:18.764 --> 33:22.268
You still believe in God,
don't you?

33:22.268 --> 33:24.370
Well, He's here.

33:24.370 --> 33:25.771
I know that you feel Him.

33:25.771 --> 33:27.106
- If He is,

33:27.106 --> 33:31.077
He is damning me to Hell.

33:31.077 --> 33:33.412
*

33:33.412 --> 33:36.115
- "Forgive us our trespasses

33:36.115 --> 33:40.319
as we forgive those
who trespass against us."

33:40.319 --> 33:44.723
- "Confess and be absolved."

33:44.723 --> 33:48.760
You can't imagine--

33:48.760 --> 33:51.997
you can't imagine
how many times I have knelt

33:51.997 --> 33:53.765
and--and prayed

33:53.765 --> 33:56.735
to be relieved of this weakness.

33:56.735 --> 34:00.106
- Yes, I can,
and I'm sure you prayed more

34:00.106 --> 34:03.409
when the monsignor used
that weakness to blackmail you.

34:03.409 --> 34:06.112
- I knew--I knew what
they were doing to those girls,

34:06.112 --> 34:08.114
and I should've protected them,
and now it's too late.

34:08.114 --> 34:09.748
- No.
No, it's not.

34:09.748 --> 34:13.985
You are standing
right here in front of Him.

34:13.985 --> 34:16.255
- Am I?

34:16.255 --> 34:19.158
I can't see Him.
I can't--

34:19.158 --> 34:22.928
I'm--I'm so blind to Him.

34:22.928 --> 34:26.398
I've been blind to Him
since before you were even born.

34:26.398 --> 34:29.401
- Well, He's here now, Father,

34:29.401 --> 34:32.738
and He sees you.

34:32.738 --> 34:35.241
So look up,

34:35.241 --> 34:40.246
and you tell Him
how truly sorry you are,

34:40.246 --> 34:42.013
and you ask for His forgiveness,

34:42.013 --> 34:45.917
and He will look
into your heart,

34:45.917 --> 34:49.155
and He'll forgive you.

34:49.155 --> 34:52.158
[somber music]

34:52.158 --> 34:54.193
*

34:54.193 --> 34:59.465
- [crying]

34:59.465 --> 35:02.534
[suspenseful music]

35:02.534 --> 35:10.576
*

35:37.636 --> 35:39.405
- 20 years--
what are we looking at?

35:39.405 --> 35:41.207
- Girls
in compromising positions

35:41.207 --> 35:42.908
with priests, cops, and johns.

35:42.908 --> 35:44.676
- Photos of the johns
are good for blackmail,

35:44.676 --> 35:46.545
but why take
pictures of themselves?

35:46.545 --> 35:48.514
- They get off on it.
- I found Eugene's

35:48.514 --> 35:50.216
psychological profiles
of the girls they trafficked,

35:50.216 --> 35:51.650
a few other counselors' too.

35:51.650 --> 35:53.419
It's like a tip sheet
for predators.

35:53.419 --> 35:56.222
- And look--look, I've got
guest lists for every party,

35:56.222 --> 35:59.225
meticulous accounting records
of rental receipts,

35:59.225 --> 36:00.992
uh, alcohol purchases--
- How much are they making?

36:00.992 --> 36:02.394
- Nothing.

36:02.394 --> 36:04.095
Doesn't look
like they charge anyone.

36:04.095 --> 36:05.497
- Then what's the point?

36:05.497 --> 36:08.066
- They want to humiliate
the girls, control them,

36:08.066 --> 36:10.302
force them to service
their powerful friends,

36:10.302 --> 36:13.004
who, in turn, owe the church.

36:13.004 --> 36:16.408
- Why keep all this?
- 'Cause they're Catholics.

36:16.408 --> 36:20.246
They don't get rid of anything,
hey just bury it.

36:26.352 --> 36:26.485
.

36:26.552 --> 36:27.085
- My name is Deanna Walsh.

36:28.987 --> 36:30.689
15 years ago,
when I was a student

36:30.689 --> 36:32.524
at St. Fabiola's,
Bishop Catalano

36:32.524 --> 36:36.528
and Monsignor Mulregan would
call me into their offices.

36:36.528 --> 36:39.398
They did things...

36:39.398 --> 36:43.168
things I thought must be normal
because they were men of God.

36:43.168 --> 36:44.770
- What would they do?

36:44.770 --> 36:46.838
- They'd make us take
our clothes off,

36:46.838 --> 36:50.976
sit on their laps--you know,
penance for our sins.

36:50.976 --> 36:54.346
They'd touch us in what
they called a "Godly manner."

36:54.346 --> 36:56.715
- They also took photos?

36:56.715 --> 36:58.049
- Yes.

36:58.049 --> 37:01.587
They made us pose naked,

37:01.587 --> 37:03.289
touching them,

37:03.289 --> 37:06.091
performing sex acts.

37:06.091 --> 37:07.926
- Did you ever tell anyone?

37:07.926 --> 37:09.995
- Monsignor Mulregan
said that if we told

37:09.995 --> 37:11.497
they'd show the photos
to our parents

37:11.497 --> 37:15.301
and tell them
what dirty whores we all were.

37:15.301 --> 37:18.103
My parents were good Catholics.

37:18.103 --> 37:19.938
It would've broken their hearts.

37:19.938 --> 37:21.440
- These priests
also forced you to have sex

37:21.440 --> 37:23.342
with other men, didn't they?

37:23.342 --> 37:27.779
- At parties--cops,
lawyers, judges.

37:27.779 --> 37:29.147
- Who brought you?

37:29.147 --> 37:30.649
- The monsignor

37:30.649 --> 37:32.484
or Father Eugene,

37:32.484 --> 37:35.554
our school
psychological counselor.

37:35.554 --> 37:37.523
- When did these parties
begin?

37:37.523 --> 37:40.025
- Uh, my understanding is
that they'd been going on

37:40.025 --> 37:41.827
for over, uh, 20 years,

37:41.827 --> 37:44.330
from when Bishop Catalano
ran the school.

37:44.330 --> 37:48.834
- So wh--why did you agree
to facilitate them?

37:48.834 --> 37:52.371
- Once Monsignor Mulregan
found out about my relationship

37:52.371 --> 37:54.406
with Lance Woodstone,
he made it clear

37:54.406 --> 37:57.343
that my life
in the Church would be over

37:57.343 --> 38:00.879
unless I used my position
to find vulnerable girls

38:00.879 --> 38:03.349
and procure them for him.

38:03.349 --> 38:05.050
- In our capacity at Vice,

38:05.050 --> 38:07.218
we encountered
the trafficking ring.

38:07.218 --> 38:09.788
Rather than expose it,
we became involved.

38:09.788 --> 38:13.058
- Right.
Okay, what did that entail?

38:13.058 --> 38:14.893
- Inappropriate behavior,

38:14.893 --> 38:16.928
not reporting the parties
to our superiors,

38:16.928 --> 38:19.665
and getting other precincts
to look the other way

38:19.665 --> 38:21.600
when needed.

38:21.600 --> 38:23.134
- Anything else?

38:23.134 --> 38:24.670
- We were asked
by Monsignor Mulregan

38:24.670 --> 38:27.272
to testify that
we had been blackmailed

38:27.272 --> 38:29.941
by IAB Captain Ed Tucker

38:29.941 --> 38:33.244
into letting him run
the trafficking ring.

38:33.244 --> 38:36.515
- Was that true?
- No.

38:36.515 --> 38:38.584
Tucker didn't know anything
about it.

38:38.584 --> 38:41.620
- You ever meet a girl
named Cara Gutierrez?

38:41.620 --> 38:44.456
- Cara Gutierrez was rescued
from this ring

38:44.456 --> 38:46.257
by Sister Nina Kelly

38:46.257 --> 38:48.394
and brought to me
at St. Bernadine's.

38:48.394 --> 38:50.529
- Where she died
of a drug overdose.

38:50.529 --> 38:53.131
Who was the last person
to see her alive?

38:53.131 --> 38:55.534
- Father Victor Akintola.

38:55.534 --> 38:57.536
- Where is Mr. Akintola now?

38:57.536 --> 38:59.671
- I believe he's in Cameroon.

38:59.671 --> 39:01.773
I bought his ticket.

39:01.773 --> 39:05.210
- Who asked you to do that?
- Monsignor Mulregan.

39:05.210 --> 39:07.879
He also instructed me to buy it

39:07.879 --> 39:11.850
under a different name,
Father Boluwaji.

39:11.850 --> 39:15.421
*

39:15.421 --> 39:19.190
[indistinct P.A. announcement]

39:19.190 --> 39:21.059
- Victor Akintola,
you're under arrest.

39:21.059 --> 39:23.128
- There's been a mistake.
I am a Nigerian national.

39:23.128 --> 39:25.063
My name is Father Boluwaji.

39:25.063 --> 39:26.532
- You're no priest.

39:26.532 --> 39:28.434
- You're coming with us.

39:28.434 --> 39:36.442
*

39:38.243 --> 39:40.979
- Took a while to get in,
but we searched the whole place.

39:40.979 --> 39:44.450
Bishop's not here.
Call the airports.

39:47.052 --> 39:48.787
Liv's coming back?

39:48.787 --> 39:50.556
- First thing tomorrow morning.

39:50.556 --> 39:52.157
Your long nightmare is over.

39:52.157 --> 39:53.792
- Oh, it wasn't that bad.

39:53.792 --> 39:57.563
- I want to thank you all
for a job well done,

39:57.563 --> 40:00.131
but I'd be remiss
if I didn't also warn you.

40:00.131 --> 40:02.167
You went after some big guns.

40:02.167 --> 40:04.803
They've got long memories
and a lot of friends.

40:04.803 --> 40:07.072
Keep your noses clean.

40:08.474 --> 40:11.176
- Is your dad always
that supportive?

40:11.176 --> 40:13.945
- Has been my whole life.
- Hey, that was Barba.

40:13.945 --> 40:16.314
The grand jury's on a roll.
As of 5:00 p.m. today,

40:16.314 --> 40:19.084
they indicted three assemblymen,
a councilman, two judges--

40:19.084 --> 40:20.351
- What about Bishop Catalano?

40:20.351 --> 40:21.653
- That's the bad news.

40:21.653 --> 40:23.321
The Vatican recalled him
yesterday.

40:23.321 --> 40:25.323
Apparently he's en route
to a treatment center

40:25.323 --> 40:27.526
they run on an island
off the coast of Chile.

40:27.526 --> 40:28.860
- Wait, what?
- What?

40:28.860 --> 40:30.662
- So they knew
to get the bishop out,

40:30.662 --> 40:32.664
yet they let Akintola
fly back to JFK,

40:32.664 --> 40:34.466
even though we had a warrant
out for him?

40:34.466 --> 40:36.201
How does that happen?
- On purpose.

40:36.201 --> 40:37.936
Akintola was a hired gun.

40:37.936 --> 40:39.805
It was a trade.

40:39.805 --> 40:42.140
A pawn for a bishop.

40:45.944 --> 40:48.680
- So you get to keep your job.

40:48.680 --> 40:51.683
- And you get yours back.

40:51.683 --> 40:54.720
- Congratulations to us.

40:59.190 --> 41:01.960
[quietly]
Hi. Thank you.

41:06.097 --> 41:08.934
What?

41:08.934 --> 41:12.070
- Nothing.
It's--it's just I thought,

41:12.070 --> 41:15.440
you know--I know this has
been stressful and everything.

41:15.440 --> 41:17.543
Thought we could
take it easy tonight.

41:17.543 --> 41:19.578
- Oh, okay.

41:19.578 --> 41:20.879
I thought we were celebrating.

41:20.879 --> 41:22.948
- Oh, we are.

41:22.948 --> 41:24.583
It's just--

41:24.583 --> 41:27.052
- I get it.

41:27.052 --> 41:29.454
You're just looking out for me.

41:29.454 --> 41:31.657
- Always.

41:38.263 --> 41:41.266
[soft music]

41:41.266 --> 41:49.307
