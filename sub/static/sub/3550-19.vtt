WEBVTT

00:00.671 --> 00:02.103
PREVIOUSLY ON...

00:02.103 --> 00:04.175
GABY LEARNED A SECRET.

00:04.175 --> 00:07.208
LEE AND I ARE
TRYING TO ADOPT A BABY.

00:07.208 --> 00:10.741
MIKE MADE A COMMITMENT.
 I CAN BE A GUY
WHO TAKES CARE OF HIS FAMILY.

00:10.741 --> 00:13.044
LYNETTE WAS WARNED.

00:13.044 --> 00:17.188
I TOLD PRESTON I WANT TO
MOVE UP WEDDING TO NEXT WEEK.
 NEXT WEEK?

00:17.188 --> 00:20.221
A KILLER PUT EVERYONE ON EDGE.

00:20.221 --> 00:22.493
I CAN'T BELIEVE SHE'S DEAD.
 I GOTTA GO HOME.

00:22.493 --> 00:24.755
MY MOM'S SO FREAKED OUT
THIS COULD HAVE BEEN ME.

00:24.755 --> 00:27.027
SHE WANTS ME AROUND.
 SO YOU'RE MY BROTHER?

00:27.027 --> 00:30.261
HALF-BROTHER, TO BE PRECISE.
 SUSPICION WAS BORN.

00:30.261 --> 00:33.804
(Orson) WHAT DO
WE REALLY KNOW ABOUT SAM?
 (Andrew) I SHOULD FIND OUT
EVERYTHING I CAN.

00:33.804 --> 00:36.367
WHY SHOULDN'T YOU?
HE'S YOUR BROTHER.

00:36.367 --> 00:41.272
AND A VERY DANGEROUS MAN
ARRIVED ON WISTERIA LANE.

00:46.377 --> 00:49.350
(Mary Alice) GOOD NEIGHBORS--

00:49.350 --> 00:52.223
THEY LOAN YOU CUPS OF SUGAR...

00:52.223 --> 00:56.787
THEY TELL YOU WHY
YOUR CAR WON'T START...

00:56.787 --> 01:01.432
THEY EVEN HELP YOU
FIND YOUR LOST PETS.

01:01.432 --> 01:03.434
(Lee) I JUST WANNA KNOW
WHO THIS PERSON IS...

01:03.434 --> 01:05.436
GOOD NEIGHBORS ALSO COME OVER

01:05.436 --> 01:08.068
AT THE SLIGHTEST HINT
OF TROUBLE...

01:08.068 --> 01:10.141
(arguing indistinctly)

01:10.141 --> 01:12.203
WHETHER YOU WANT 'EM THERE
OR NOT.

01:12.203 --> 01:15.206
...BEING UNREASONABLE!
 YOU KNOW WHAT? I'M TIRED
OF FIGHTING ABOUT THIS.

01:15.206 --> 01:17.608
OKAY, FINE. WALK AWAY.
IT'S WHAT YOU ALWAYS DO.

01:19.710 --> 01:21.682
GABY, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

01:21.682 --> 01:23.454
UH...

01:23.454 --> 01:26.687
I CAME TO RETURN
THIS MAGAZINE LEE LENT ME,

01:26.687 --> 01:29.760
BUT YOU TWO WERE ARGUING,
SO...

01:29.760 --> 01:32.193
SO YOU DECIDED IT WOULD BE FUN
TO EAVESDROP?

01:32.193 --> 01:34.625
GOD, IT'S LIKE
YOU SEE INTO MY SOUL,

01:34.625 --> 01:36.627
AND YET YOU DON'T JUDGE.
THANK YOU.

01:38.199 --> 01:41.572
OH, COME ON.
TELL ME WHAT HAPPENED.

01:43.204 --> 01:45.206
OUR EGG DONOR BACKED OUT.

01:45.206 --> 01:46.807
NOT AGAIN.

01:46.807 --> 01:48.879
AND THE SURROGATE WE HIRED
WILL PULL OUT

01:48.879 --> 01:52.313
IF THE PROCEDURE ISN'T DONE
IN THE NEXT MONTH.
 WELL, CAN'T YOU FIND
ANOTHER EGG DONOR?

01:52.313 --> 01:56.387
WE COULD,
IF LEE WASN'T SO PICKY.
 WHY ARE YOU DISCUSSING THIS
WITH HER?

01:56.387 --> 01:58.619
(sighs) FOR GOD SAKES,
I WAS EAVESDROPPING. CATCH UP.

01:58.619 --> 02:00.191
OKAY, YEAH, I'M PICKY.

02:00.191 --> 02:02.193
WE SPENT TWO YEARS
CHOOSING A MATTRESS.

02:02.193 --> 02:05.125
I'M NOT JUST GOING TO GET
OUR CHILD'S D.N.A.

02:05.125 --> 02:07.358
OUT OF THE YELLOW PAGES.
 IF WE LOSE THE SURROGATE,

02:07.358 --> 02:12.203
IT COULD TAKE MONTHS
TO FIND ANOTHER ONE.
 YEAH, AND THEN SHE'LL DROP OUT
FOR SOME RIDICULOUS REASON,

02:12.203 --> 02:14.805
AND I CAN'T TAKE
ANY MORE OF THIS!

02:14.805 --> 02:17.808
YOU KNOW, MAYBE WE'RE NOT
SUPPOSED TO BE PARENTS.
 DON'T TALK LIKE THAT!

02:17.808 --> 02:20.511
COME ON!
DOESN'T IT SEEM LIKE

02:20.511 --> 02:24.315
THE UNIVERSE IS TRYING
TO TELL US SOMETHING?
 WHY NOT TAKE MINE?

02:24.315 --> 02:27.147
TAKE YOUR WHAT?
 MY EGGS.

02:28.779 --> 02:30.781
I MEAN, I'VE GOT PLENTY,

02:30.781 --> 02:33.384
AND I HATE TO SEE YOU GUYS
SO UNHAPPY.

02:33.384 --> 02:34.855
SO WHAT THE HECK?

02:34.855 --> 02:39.930
GOOD NEIGHBORS--THEY'RE PEOPLE
WHO TRY TO HELP OTHERS.

02:39.930 --> 02:41.332
OH!

02:41.332 --> 02:42.733
(laughs)

02:42.733 --> 02:45.236
BAD NEIGHBORS ARE PEOPLE
WHO MAKE PROMISES

02:45.236 --> 02:57.808
THEY CAN'T POSSIBLY KEEP.

02:57.808 --> 03:02.483
THE MORNING PAPER SAID
A YOUNG GIRL WAS MISSING.

03:02.483 --> 03:04.184
IT QUOTED HER FAMILY,

03:04.184 --> 03:07.918
WHO SAID SHE HAD VANISHED
ON HER WAY TO WORK.

03:07.918 --> 03:10.361
IT QUOTED HER FRIENDS,

03:10.361 --> 03:14.595
WHO SAID SHE WASN'T THE TYPE
TO RUN AWAY FROM HOME.

03:14.595 --> 03:16.897
IT QUOTED THE POLICE,

03:16.897 --> 03:20.901
WHO SAID THEY HAD
VERY LITTLE EVIDENCE TO GO ON.

03:20.901 --> 03:27.708
SADLY, PEOPLE DIDN'T PAY MUCH
ATTENTION TO THIS BIT OF NEWS.

03:30.681 --> 03:32.683
NO ONE THINKS ABOUT EVIL

03:32.683 --> 03:36.587
UNTIL IT SHOWS UP
ON THEIR DOORSTEP,

03:36.587 --> 03:40.220
WHICH IT SOON WOULD.

03:48.799 --> 03:51.402
OH, MY GOD. THIEF!

03:51.402 --> 03:54.265
HEY! YOU!

03:54.265 --> 03:56.807
FREEZE!
 WHOA! WHOA!
LADY, PUT THAT THING DOWN.

03:56.807 --> 03:59.810
OH, YEAH? WHILE I'M AT IT, WHY
DON'T I JUST HAND YOU THE KEYS?

03:59.810 --> 04:02.673
NOW HIT THE DIRT!
 RELAX.
I'M NOT STEALING ANYTHING.

04:02.673 --> 04:03.974
THIS IS A REPOSSESSION.

04:03.974 --> 04:07.778
DO I LOOK STUPID TO YOU?
FIRE! FIRE!

04:07.778 --> 04:10.851
WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING?
 PEOPLE COME QUICKER
WHEN YOU YELL "FIRE."

04:10.851 --> 04:14.655
NOW I BELIEVE I TOLD YOU
 TO HIT THE DIRT!

04:14.655 --> 04:16.026
WHERE'S THE FIRE?

04:16.026 --> 04:17.988
(Angie) SUSAN, YOU OKAY?

04:17.988 --> 04:20.531
(Susan)
I'M FINE. JUST CALL 9-1-1!

04:20.531 --> 04:24.635
HEY, WHAT'S GOING ON?
 THIS THIEF IS TRYING
TO STEAL YOUR TRUCK!

04:24.635 --> 04:28.299
HEY. YOU'RE THE GUY WHO'S FOUR
MONTHS BEHIND ON HIS PAYMENTS?

04:28.299 --> 04:30.371
YEAH.

04:30.371 --> 04:32.673
STOP, DROP AND ROLL!

04:32.673 --> 04:36.276
STOP, DROP AND ROLL!

04:38.709 --> 04:42.282
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME
YOU WERE HAVING MONEY PROBLEMS?

04:42.282 --> 04:44.985
I WAS HOPING BUSINESS WOULD PICK
UP BEFORE ANYBODY FOUND OUT.

04:44.985 --> 04:47.358
(truck horn honks)

04:49.360 --> 04:51.492
BUT I GUESS
THAT'S NO LONGER AN OPTION.

04:51.492 --> 04:53.494
MIKE, WE TALKED ABOUT THIS.

04:53.494 --> 04:55.366
I TOLD YOU,
I AM WILLING TO HELP.

04:55.366 --> 04:57.728
AND I TOLD YOU, I'M NOT
TAKING MY WIFE'S MONEY.

04:57.728 --> 04:59.900
WELL,
ENOUGH WITH THE MACHO PRIDE.

04:59.900 --> 05:01.902
I MAKE A STEADY PAYCHECK,

05:01.902 --> 05:05.376
AND I HAVE ALL THAT MONEY
FROM SELLING KARL'S STRIP CLUB.

05:05.376 --> 05:07.838
NO. I'M DEFINITELY NOT TAKING
YOUR EX-HUSBAND'S MONEY.

05:07.838 --> 05:10.911
ARE WE DONE HERE?
 SURE.
AS LONG AS YOU CAN EXPLAIN

05:10.911 --> 05:12.983
HOW YOU'RE GOING TO RUN
A PLUMBING BUSINESS

05:12.983 --> 05:14.985
WITHOUT A TRUCK.

05:14.985 --> 05:17.388
I DON'T KNOW.
I'LL FIGURE IT OUT.

05:20.451 --> 05:22.022
(Bree laughs)

05:22.022 --> 05:25.025
AND FOR THE COVER OF THE BOOK,
I SEE YOU IN AN EVENING GOWN,

05:25.025 --> 05:27.758
SITTING ON A BALE OF HAY,
RINGING A DINNER BELL.

05:27.758 --> 05:30.931
(laughs) I LOVE IT.
SUCH A SENSE OF WHIMSY.

05:30.931 --> 05:33.033
WELL, IF IT ISN'T
THE DYNAMIC DUO.

05:33.033 --> 05:35.035
HOW DID YOUR MEETING
WITH THE PUBLISHER GO?

05:35.035 --> 05:36.507
FANTASTIC.

05:36.507 --> 05:39.710
BRUCE LOVED THE IDEA
OF A NOUVELLE SOUTHERN COOKBOOK.

05:39.710 --> 05:41.712
AND YOUR BROTHER CAME UP

05:41.712 --> 05:45.976
WITH THE MARKETING SLOGAN
IN THE ROOM. TELL HIM, SAM.

05:45.976 --> 05:47.618
"MRS. VAN DE KAMP

05:47.618 --> 05:50.951
INTRODUCES YOU
TO UPSCALE DOWN-HOME CUISINE."

05:50.951 --> 05:54.124
CATCHY. I-I GUESS YOU KNOW
ALL ABOUT MARKETING,

05:54.124 --> 05:56.126
HAVING AN MBA AND ALL.

05:56.126 --> 05:58.058
I GUESS SO.

05:58.058 --> 06:03.734
EXCEPT, OF COURSE, YOU DON'T
ACTUALLY HAVE AN MBA.

06:03.734 --> 06:05.736
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

06:05.736 --> 06:08.639
I MADE A FEW CALLS,
CHECKED A FEW RECORDS.

06:08.639 --> 06:13.073
TURNS OUT THE GOLDEN CHILD
NEVER GOT HIS DEGREE.

06:13.073 --> 06:17.047
IS THIS TRUE?

06:17.047 --> 06:19.580
YES.
I'M A FEW CLASSES SHORT.

06:19.580 --> 06:21.682
IS ONE OF THEM ETHICS?

06:21.682 --> 06:24.014
ANDREW, PLEASE.

06:24.014 --> 06:28.118
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

06:28.118 --> 06:30.721
IT WAS THE FINAL SEMESTER.

06:30.721 --> 06:32.723
WE WERE ABOUT TWO MONTHS IN

06:32.723 --> 06:35.426
WHEN THE DOCTOR TOLD ME
MY MOTHER WAS TERMINAL.

06:35.426 --> 06:37.628
I LEFT SCHOOL
AND BROUGHT HER HOME

06:37.628 --> 06:40.571
SO SHE DIDN'T HAVE TO DIE
IN THE HOSPITAL.

06:40.571 --> 06:42.973
IF YOU LIKE,

06:42.973 --> 06:44.975
I CAN SAVE YOU A PHONE CALL

06:44.975 --> 06:47.508
AND BRING IN
HER DEATH CERTIFICATE.

06:49.980 --> 06:51.642
THAT'S OKAY. (clears throat)

06:53.043 --> 06:55.716
THE UNIVERSITY LET ME
GRADUATE WITH MY CLASS.

06:55.716 --> 06:58.549
I SHOULD FINISH MY COURSEWORK
NEXT MONTH.

06:58.549 --> 07:00.050
BUT I'M SORRY, BREE.

07:00.050 --> 07:03.824
I SHOULD NOT HAVE
MISREPRESENTED MYSELF.

07:03.824 --> 07:06.126
EVERYONE STEPS OVER THE LINE
NOW AND THEN.

07:06.126 --> 07:09.059
LET'S ALL MAKE AN EFFORT
NOT TO,

07:09.059 --> 07:10.601
SHALL WE?

07:13.734 --> 07:19.009
(speaks Russian)

07:19.009 --> 07:21.512
(speaks Russian)

07:21.512 --> 07:25.115
THIS WOMAN IS INCOMPETENT.
WHY YOU BRING ME HERE?

07:25.115 --> 07:28.048
HEY, YOU'RE THE ONE WHO HAD TO
COME TO A RUSSIAN BRIDAL SHOP.

07:28.048 --> 07:30.681
IT WAS MISTAKE.

07:30.681 --> 07:32.983
WELL... LOOK AT THE FUN
YOU'RE HAVING

07:32.983 --> 07:37.127
CHEWING PEOPLE OUT
IN YOUR NATIVE TONGUE.

07:37.127 --> 07:38.489
(lowered voice) HEY.

07:38.489 --> 07:41.932
SORRY FOR THE WAY
SHE'S BEEN TALKING TO YOU.

07:41.932 --> 07:43.934
DON'T WORRY.
YOU'RE NOT LOSING A SON.

07:43.934 --> 07:45.936
YOU ARE GAINING
A PAIN IN THE ASS.

07:45.936 --> 07:47.598
TELL ME ABOUT IT.

07:47.598 --> 07:50.100
MY SON IS MARRYING A WOMAN
HE BARELY KNOWS.

07:50.100 --> 07:52.102
HE'S MAKING THE BIGGEST MISTAKE
OF HIS LIFE,

07:52.102 --> 07:54.144
AND I AM POWERLESS
TO STOP HIM.

07:54.144 --> 07:55.846
IF YOU LIKE,

07:55.846 --> 07:58.048
MAYBE I GET A LITTLE SLOPPY
WITH THE PUSHPINS.

07:58.048 --> 08:00.010
AW, YOU'RE SWEET.

08:00.010 --> 08:02.212
(cell phone rings)

08:02.212 --> 08:04.715
(ring)
 IRINA? IT'S YOUR PHONE.

08:04.715 --> 08:05.716
(ring)

08:05.716 --> 08:08.158
IF IT'S PRESTON,
TELL HIM I BE HOME SOON.

08:08.158 --> 08:09.119
(ring)

08:09.119 --> 08:10.921
OKAY, YOUR HIGHNESS.

08:10.921 --> 08:13.163
BRIDE'S PHONE.

08:13.163 --> 08:15.165
(man) Irina...
(shouting in Russian)

08:15.165 --> 08:18.599
OKAY. SLOW DOWN.
I... I DON'T SPEAK RUSSIAN.

08:18.599 --> 08:22.002
IRINA, IT'S SOME RUSSIAN GUY,
AND HE DOESN'T SOUND HAPPY.

08:22.002 --> 08:23.904
(man continues shouting
in Russian)

08:23.904 --> 08:27.107
ALEXEI... (speaking Russian)

08:30.841 --> 08:31.842
(beep)

08:31.842 --> 08:33.143
WHO WAS THAT?

08:33.143 --> 08:34.715
WRONG NUMBER.

08:34.715 --> 08:37.688
WRONG NUMBER?
HE ASKED FOR YOU BY NAME.

08:37.688 --> 08:41.150
IF I WANTED YOU TO KNOW,
I WOULD SAY IT IN ENGLISH.

08:41.150 --> 08:43.123
MISSUS?

08:44.895 --> 08:48.599
I CAN SAY IT IN ENGLISH.

08:51.161 --> 08:53.163
(espresso machine whirring)

08:53.163 --> 08:55.806
HEY. DOUBLE CAPPUCCINO,
EXTRA HOT.

08:55.806 --> 08:57.267
(cup clinks)

08:57.267 --> 08:59.039
NEED ANYTHING ELSE?

08:59.039 --> 09:01.912
INSPIRATION.

09:01.912 --> 09:03.614
(chuckles)

09:03.614 --> 09:05.075
SORRY. WE JUST HAVE MUFFINS.

09:05.075 --> 09:07.077
(laughs)

09:07.077 --> 09:09.119
WHAT ARE YOU WORKING ON?

09:09.119 --> 09:11.752
A NOVEL.

09:11.752 --> 09:14.054
I KNOW--ANOTHER GUY IN
A COFFEE SHOP WRITING A NOVEL.

09:14.054 --> 09:16.627
JUST WHAT THE WORLD NEEDS.

09:16.627 --> 09:20.060
NO, I THINK IT'S COOL.
MIND IF I ASK WHAT IT'S ABOUT?

09:20.060 --> 09:22.132
YOU REALLY WANNA KNOW?

09:22.132 --> 09:23.764
I DO.

09:23.764 --> 09:27.137
IT STARTED OUT
AS A LOVE STORY,

09:27.137 --> 09:30.971
BUT IT'S GETTING
KIND OF DARK.

09:30.971 --> 09:33.203
THIS GUY MEETS THIS GIRL,

09:33.203 --> 09:35.776
TAKES HER FROM NOTHING,

09:35.776 --> 09:37.678
GIVES HER LIFE MEANING.

09:37.678 --> 09:40.010
BASICALLY CREATES HER.

09:40.010 --> 09:42.082
OKAY.

09:42.082 --> 09:44.184
THEN ONE DAY,

09:44.184 --> 09:46.617
SHE JUST DISAPPEARS...

09:46.617 --> 09:48.889
VANISHES...

09:48.889 --> 09:50.220
WITH ANOTHER MAN.

09:50.220 --> 09:52.262
(scoffs) SUCKS FOR THE GUY.

09:52.262 --> 09:54.965
AND SHE TAKES HIS BABY.

09:54.965 --> 09:58.168
DAMN. WELL, SHE SOUNDS
LIKE A BITCH.

09:58.168 --> 10:00.831
SURE DOES.

10:00.831 --> 10:03.033
ANYHOW, I'M UP TO THE POINT

10:03.033 --> 10:06.036
WHERE THE GUY WHO'S BEEN
LOOKING FOR HER FOR A LONG TIME

10:06.036 --> 10:08.038
FINALLY TRACKS HER DOWN.

10:10.380 --> 10:13.083
AND THAT'S WHERE
I'M KIND OF STUCK.

10:15.015 --> 10:17.788
WHAT DOES HE DO?

10:17.788 --> 10:21.051
WELL, I DON'T KNOW
ALL THE DETAILS,

10:21.051 --> 10:23.053
BUT YOU SAID IT WAS DARK,
RIGHT?

10:23.053 --> 10:24.254
YEAH.

10:27.157 --> 10:30.060
SEEMS TO ME
THE GUY WOULD KILL HER.

10:30.060 --> 10:33.934
FUNNY. THAT WAS EXACTLY
MY FIRST INSTINCT, TOO.

10:43.774 --> 10:45.315
NO.

10:45.315 --> 10:49.319
NO?
 YOU ASKED MY PERMISSION TO BE
AN EGG DONOR, AND I SAID "NO."

10:49.319 --> 10:52.082
OH, I WASN'T ASKING YOU.
I WAS TELLING YOU.

10:52.082 --> 10:54.084
SORRY. YOU CAN'T DO THIS
WITHOUT MY APPROVAL.

10:54.084 --> 10:55.886
THOSE EGGS ARE HALF MINE.

10:55.886 --> 10:57.888
HOW SO?
 I'M YOUR HUSBAND.

10:57.888 --> 11:00.961
I OWN 50% OF WHATEVER
COMES OUT OF THAT UTERUS.

11:00.961 --> 11:03.934
OH! SO YOU THINK
YOU OWN MY BODY.

11:03.934 --> 11:05.936
I PAY FOR THE CLOTHES
IT WEARS,

11:05.936 --> 11:07.397
THE MASSAGES IT RECEIVES

11:07.397 --> 11:09.369
AND THE IMPLANTS
IT WILL ONE DAY REQUIRE.

11:09.369 --> 11:11.902
IF I DON'T OWN IT, I'M AT LEAST
A MAJOR STOCKHOLDER.

11:11.902 --> 11:13.904
WHICH MEANS I CAN STOP YOU

11:13.904 --> 11:15.906
FROM HANDING OUT YOUR EGGS
LIKE PARTY FAVORS

11:15.906 --> 11:18.779
TO EVERY CHILDLESS GAY COUPLE
THAT WANDERS BY.

11:18.779 --> 11:21.782
YOU CANNOT STOP ME. I CAN DO
WHATEVER I WANT WITH MY EGGS.

11:21.782 --> 11:24.785
AND I CAN DO WHATEVER I WANT
WITH THE CREDIT CARDS I PAY FOR.

11:24.785 --> 11:26.787
FOR EXAMPLE,
I CAN CUT THEM UP.

11:26.787 --> 11:28.789
I DON'T CARE
ABOUT CREDIT CARDS.

11:28.789 --> 11:30.791
I AM TRYING TO DO
SOMETHING NOBLE HERE.

11:30.791 --> 11:33.924
I'M HELPING THESE PEOPLE
BECOME A FAMILY.

11:33.924 --> 11:35.926
YOU'VE HIDDEN THE CARDS,
HAVEN'T YOU?

11:35.926 --> 11:36.927
DAMN STRAIGHT.

11:36.927 --> 11:39.129
OKAY, I AM BEGGING YOU,

11:39.129 --> 11:40.801
AS YOUR HUSBAND,

11:40.801 --> 11:43.103
PLEASE DON'T DO THIS.

11:43.103 --> 11:45.375
IT'LL BE TOO WEIRD HAVING
YOUR D.N.A. LIVING NEXT DOOR.

11:45.375 --> 11:47.738
I DON'T CARE.
MY MIND IS MADE UP.

11:47.738 --> 11:50.240
I AM GOING TO HELP BOB AND LEE
HAVE A BABY

11:50.240 --> 11:52.242
SO THEY CAN EXPERIENCE
THE SAME LOVE AND JOY

11:52.242 --> 11:54.144
THAT WE OCCASIONALLY HAVE
WITH OUR CHILDREN.

11:56.887 --> 12:00.150
SO THE RUSSIAN SALESGIRL
TRANSLATED FOR ME,

12:00.150 --> 12:03.093
AND YOU'LL NEVER GUESS
WHAT IRINA SAID TO THE...

12:03.093 --> 12:05.325
ANGRY GUY ON THE PHONE.

12:05.325 --> 12:07.127
PLEASE DON'T MAKE ME GUESS.

12:07.127 --> 12:10.200
SHE SAID, "GO AHEAD
AND CALL THE POLICE."

12:10.200 --> 12:13.333
YOU'LL NEVER FIND ME."

12:13.333 --> 12:15.335
AND THAT'S IT?

12:15.335 --> 12:18.208
HOW MUCH MORE DO YOU NEED?

12:18.208 --> 12:21.511
SHE IS A FOREIGNER.
SHE'S DONE SOMETHING CRIMINAL.

12:21.511 --> 12:23.173
START YOUR DEPORTATION NOW.

12:23.173 --> 12:26.076
MA'AM, WITHOUT PROOF
OF CRIMINAL ACTIVITY,

12:26.076 --> 12:28.078
THERE'S NOTHING I CAN DO.

12:28.078 --> 12:31.151
CAN'T YOU AT LEAST...
INTERROGATE HER?

12:31.151 --> 12:34.154
YES, AND... IF YOU WANNA
SLAP HER AROUND A BIT,

12:34.154 --> 12:36.156
YOU'LL GET NO COMPLAINTS
FROM ME.

12:36.156 --> 12:38.188
LOOK, MRS. SCAVO,
WE ARE A GOVERNMENT AGENCY.

12:38.188 --> 12:40.230
WE CAN'T INVESTIGATE
YOUR FUTURE DAUGHTER-IN-LAW

12:40.230 --> 12:43.493
JUST BECAUSE YOU DON'T THINK
SHE'S GOOD FOR YOUR SON.

12:43.493 --> 12:46.136
(sighs)

12:46.136 --> 12:48.338
AH. IT ALL MAKES SENSE NOW.

12:48.338 --> 12:50.340
YOU'RE SINGLE, RIGHT?
NEVER HAD ANY KIDS?

12:50.340 --> 12:51.341
YEAH. SO?

12:51.341 --> 12:53.043
(sets down frame)

12:53.043 --> 12:55.505
YOU JUST DON'T GET IT.

12:55.505 --> 12:57.848
(telephone rings)

13:01.311 --> 13:03.113
(ring)

13:05.856 --> 13:09.259
HI. NICE-LOOKING FAMILY.
IS THAT YOUR DAUGHTER-IN-LAW?

13:09.259 --> 13:11.491
YEAH.

13:11.491 --> 13:13.193
YOU TWO GET ALONG?

13:13.193 --> 13:15.195
DON'T GET ME STARTED.

13:15.195 --> 13:19.169
GOT A MINUTE?

13:24.875 --> 13:28.208
M.J., WHAT ARE YOU DOIN'?
 CLOGGING THE SINK.

13:28.208 --> 13:29.379
WHAT?

13:29.379 --> 13:31.081
DADDY NEEDS WORK.

13:31.081 --> 13:32.382
OHH!
 (turns faucet off)

13:32.382 --> 13:35.215
HONEY, THAT'S SWEET,
BUT DADDY ONLY GETS PAID

13:35.215 --> 13:37.517
WHEN OTHER PEOPLE HAVE
PLUMBING PROBLEMS.

13:37.517 --> 13:41.221
SO I SHOULD DO THIS
TO SOMEBODY ELSE'S SINK?

13:41.221 --> 13:43.093
NO, HONEY. (laughs)

13:43.093 --> 13:45.095
THAT WOULD BE WRONG.

13:49.559 --> 13:51.831
(knock on door,
door creaks)

13:51.831 --> 13:55.035
HI. I'M HAVING A PROBLEM
WITH MIKE AND HIS MALE EGO.

13:55.035 --> 13:57.337
LONG STORY SHORT--
CAN I CLOG YOUR DRAIN?

14:01.411 --> 14:04.114
SO DON'T PHONE MIKE
UNTIL I GET HOME.

14:04.114 --> 14:07.177
UGH. OKAY, AND WHEN YOU
CALL HIM, SOUND DESPERATE.

14:07.177 --> 14:09.349
THAT WAY, HE'LL FEEL USEFUL.

14:09.349 --> 14:11.121
(metal clanks, water splashes)

14:11.121 --> 14:15.155
BUT DON'T CALL TILL SATURDAY.
HE GETS DOUBLE TIME ON WEEKENDS.

14:15.155 --> 14:16.186
(spoon clinks)

14:16.186 --> 14:19.089
(garbage disposal whirring)

14:20.860 --> 14:22.862
THERE'S ENOUGH THERE
FOR A TIP,

14:22.862 --> 14:24.864
BUT CAREFUL
WHEN YOU GIVE IT TO HIM.

14:24.864 --> 14:27.867
I DON'T WANT HIM THINKING
ANYONE'S DOING HIM A FAVOR.

14:27.867 --> 14:30.170
TRUST ME, BRUCE. AFTER THEY
TASTE THESE RECIPES,

14:30.170 --> 14:32.202
THEY WILL BE ONBOARD.

14:32.202 --> 14:34.504
JUST GIVE ME THE CHANCE
TO DAZZLE THEM.

14:34.504 --> 14:36.276
OKAY. BYE.

14:36.276 --> 14:37.908
(beep)
 PROBLEMS?

14:37.908 --> 14:40.911
BRUCE GOT A LITTLE RESISTANCE
WHEN HE MET WITH THE SALES TEAM.

14:40.911 --> 14:43.483
THEY FEAR SOUTHERN COOKBOOKS
ARE A TAD OVERDONE.

14:43.483 --> 14:46.156
SO I SUGGESTED
WE HAVE A LITTLE DINNER

14:46.156 --> 14:48.518
TO LET THEM SAMPLE
THE RECIPES THEMSELVES.
 EXCELLENT.

14:48.518 --> 14:50.520
WE HAVE TO
REALLY IMPRESS THEM.

14:50.520 --> 14:52.662
LET'S SEE IF WE CAN BOOK
THE PRIVATE DINING ROOM

14:52.662 --> 14:55.165
AT THE BRITANNIAN HOTEL.
 I'LL TAKE CARE OF IT.

14:55.165 --> 14:58.598
BUT BEFORE I DO, I HAVE
SOMETHING... DIFFICULT TO SAY.

14:58.598 --> 15:01.301
WELL, I HOPE IT'S NOT ABOUT
THAT SILLY MBA BUSINESS.

15:01.301 --> 15:05.105
I THINK I KNOW WHY ANDREW TRIED
TO DISCREDIT ME YESTERDAY.

15:05.105 --> 15:06.436
OH?

15:06.436 --> 15:09.139
HE KNEW YOU HAD ME
AUDITING THE BOOKS,

15:09.139 --> 15:12.212
AND HE KNEW
WHAT I WAS GONNA FIND.

15:12.212 --> 15:14.144
WHAT DID YOU FIND?

15:18.949 --> 15:22.452
DID YOU CHARGE THE DONELLYS
FOR FIVE CASES OF VODKA?

15:22.452 --> 15:24.294
YEAH. SO?

15:24.294 --> 15:25.956
ACCORDING TO OUR INVOICES,

15:25.956 --> 15:27.958
ONLY FOUR WERE DELIVERED
TO THEIR PARTY.

15:27.958 --> 15:31.361
AND THE ROTARY CLUB LUNCHEON WAS
CHARGED FOR SEVEN CASES OF WINE,

15:31.361 --> 15:34.304
AND ONLY SIX SHOWED UP.
 WHY ARE YOU EVEN LOOKING
AT THIS STUFF?

15:34.304 --> 15:37.267
AND I SEEM TO RECALL YOUR HAVING
A PARTY THAT SAME WEEKEND,

15:37.267 --> 15:39.209
WITH LOTS OF WINE
AND LOTS OF VODKA.

15:39.209 --> 15:41.611
OKAY, YEAH, I-I TOOK
SOME LEFTOVER BOOZE TO MY HOUSE

15:41.611 --> 15:43.613
FOR A PARTY.
WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL?

15:43.613 --> 15:47.117
IT WASN'T LEFTOVER. YOU CHARGED
THE CLIENT FOR THAT LIQUOR.

15:47.117 --> 15:49.579
THAT'S STEALING.
 IS SAM THE ONE
WHO TOLD YOU ABOUT THIS?

15:49.579 --> 15:52.722
WE ARE NOT TALKING ABOUT SAM
RIGHT NOW.
 BUT WE NEED TO.

15:52.722 --> 15:56.056
CAN'T YOU SEE
THE TYPE OF PERSON HE IS?

15:56.056 --> 15:58.358
YES, HE IS THE TYPE OF PERSON
WHO LEAVES COLLEGE

15:58.358 --> 16:00.430
TO CARE FOR HIS DYING MOTHER.

16:00.430 --> 16:04.364
YOU ARE THE TYPE OF PERSON
WHO STEALS FROM CLIENTS.

16:04.364 --> 16:06.366
BELIEVE WHAT
YOU WANNA BELIEVE,

16:06.366 --> 16:08.538
BUT I'M NOT GONNA LISTEN
TO THIS.

16:08.538 --> 16:10.240
ANDREW.
 (door opens)

16:11.601 --> 16:13.603
DON'T YOU WALK AWAY FROM ME!

16:13.603 --> 16:16.306
CAN'T YOU SEE HOW
HE'S MANIPULATING YOU?

16:16.306 --> 16:19.979
HOW STUPID CAN YOU BE?
 APPARENTLY I'M STUPID ENOUGH
TO HAVE TRUSTED YOU.

16:19.979 --> 16:24.284
WELL, IF I'M THE PROBLEM,
WHY NOT JUST FIRE ME?
 I'M TEMPTED. DON'T PUSH ME.

16:32.192 --> 16:35.325
(sighs) CLEAR YOUR THINGS OUT
AND TURN IN YOUR KEYS.

16:38.668 --> 16:42.102
(door slams)

16:55.345 --> 16:57.347
OH, HEY, TOM.
 (shifts gears)

16:57.347 --> 17:00.150
Did Irina and Preston say when
they'd be back from the mall?

17:00.150 --> 17:01.751
STOP!
 (brakes squeal)

17:01.751 --> 17:03.093
STOP WHAT?

17:03.093 --> 17:04.223
(sighs)

17:04.223 --> 17:08.228
NOT YOU.
I'M TEACHING PARKER TO DRIVE.

17:08.228 --> 17:11.601
OKAY. I'M PLANNING TO STEAL
IRINA'S PASSPORT NUMBER.

17:11.601 --> 17:13.633
OH, GOD.
WHAT ARE YOU UP TO NOW?

17:13.633 --> 17:16.106
I HAVE A NEW BEST FRIEND
AT IMMIGRATION

17:16.106 --> 17:18.238
who's got a friend
at the Russian embassy

17:18.238 --> 17:20.470
WHO'S AGREED TO INITIATE
A BACKGROUND SEARCH.

17:20.470 --> 17:22.512
LYNETTE, THIS IS GETTING
OUT OF HAND.

17:22.512 --> 17:25.714
THAT WOMAN IS HIDING SOMETHING,
AND I AM TAKING HER DOWN.

17:25.714 --> 17:27.477
(groans)

17:34.184 --> 17:35.485
DA!

17:40.330 --> 17:41.431
(mutters)

17:41.431 --> 17:44.063
(front door slams,
rapid footsteps approach)

17:44.063 --> 17:46.536
(giggling)

17:50.570 --> 17:54.174
(Irina) YOU BUY ME BEAUTIFUL
THINGS, AND NOW I THANK YOU.
 AHH!

17:55.375 --> 17:57.177
COME ON.

17:57.177 --> 18:00.310
(giggles)

18:00.310 --> 18:03.383
(Preston) WE SHOULDN'T BE
IN HERE WITH THE DOOR CLOSED.

18:03.383 --> 18:06.386
MY MOM GETS
A LITTLE FREAKED OUT.
 WELL, YOUR MOTHER IS A PRUDE.

18:06.386 --> 18:09.389
THAT IS WHAT HAPPENS TO WOMEN
WHEN THEY GROW OLD.

18:09.389 --> 18:10.690
NOW KISS ME.
 MMM.

18:10.690 --> 18:12.292
MMM! (giggles)
 OH, MY GOD.

18:12.292 --> 18:15.295
(Preston and Irina giggling)

18:19.199 --> 18:20.700
(beeps)
 WHO'S THAT?

18:20.700 --> 18:21.871
YOUR MOM.

18:21.871 --> 18:24.103
"GET HOME NOW.

18:24.103 --> 18:26.306
"TRAPPED BEHIND
THE CLOSET DOOR.

18:26.306 --> 18:29.739
PRESTON AND IRINA
ARE ABOUT TO--"

18:29.739 --> 18:32.212
PULL OVER.
I GOTTA GET HOME FAST.

18:32.212 --> 18:34.314
I CAN GO FAST.

18:37.787 --> 18:39.149
(giggles)

18:39.149 --> 18:41.891
SERIOUSLY, IRINA,
MY MOM'S IN THE HOUSE.

18:41.891 --> 18:44.724
I KNOW. IS WHAT MAKE IT FUN.
(laughs)

18:44.724 --> 18:46.256
(Preston laughs)

18:46.256 --> 18:49.259
(giggling)

18:56.366 --> 18:58.838
(thud)

19:08.518 --> 19:10.520
MMM.

19:10.520 --> 19:14.554
HONEY MAPLE SHORT RIBS DRIZZLED
WITH MANZANILLA SHERRY.

19:16.386 --> 19:17.687
THESE ARE AMAZING.

19:17.687 --> 19:20.360
BRUCE'S SALES TEAM
WILL BE POWERLESS TO RESIST.

19:20.360 --> 19:22.862
WELL, YOU ARE REALLY FOCUSED
ON THIS DINNER,

19:22.862 --> 19:25.395
WHICH IS AMAZING
CONSIDERING WHAT HAPPENED.

19:25.395 --> 19:29.299
I MEAN...
FIRING YOUR OWN SON.

19:29.299 --> 19:31.801
I'VE DONE WORSE THINGS
TO ANDREW.

19:31.801 --> 19:35.705
WE HAVE A...
VERY COMPLICATED RELATIONSHIP.

19:35.705 --> 19:39.279
YOU'LL SEE THAT THE LONGER
YOU'RE AT THE COMPANY.

19:39.279 --> 19:41.911
HOW? YOU FIRED HIM.

19:41.911 --> 19:43.913
NO, THAT'S JUST OUR PATTERN.

19:43.913 --> 19:46.416
HE PROVOKES ME,
AND I PUSH HIM AWAY,

19:46.416 --> 19:48.418
BUT WE ALWAYS COME BACK
TOGETHER.

19:48.418 --> 19:50.620
SO... YOU'RE GOING
TO BRING HIM BACK IN?

19:50.620 --> 19:51.891
EVENTUALLY.

19:51.891 --> 19:53.963
BUT THE STEALING...

19:53.963 --> 19:56.266
AND THE WAY
HE SPOKE TO YOU, I...

19:56.266 --> 19:58.268
SAM, HE'S MY SON.

20:05.405 --> 20:07.407
HEY. BUSY DAY, HUH?

20:07.407 --> 20:09.239
YEAH, BUSY WEEK.

20:09.239 --> 20:10.910
IT'S SO FUNNY.

20:10.910 --> 20:13.483
I'VE HAD ALL THIS WORK
RIGHT HERE ON THE LANE.

20:13.483 --> 20:15.345
WELL, THAT'S GOOD, RIGHT?

20:15.345 --> 20:17.647
ESPECIALLY SINCE
YOU DON'T HAVE YOUR TRUCK.

20:17.647 --> 20:20.290
UH-HUH. HEY.

20:20.290 --> 20:22.722
GUESS WHAT I FOUND?

20:22.722 --> 20:24.424
OH! MY EARRING.

20:24.424 --> 20:26.256
BEEN LOOKING ALL OVER FOR THAT.
WHERE'D YOU FIND IT?

20:26.256 --> 20:28.328
GABY'S BATHTUB DRAIN.

20:28.328 --> 20:29.429
OH.

20:33.363 --> 20:36.306
OHH, OF COURSE.

20:36.306 --> 20:38.638
GABY AND I WENT JOGGING,
AND, UH...

20:38.638 --> 20:40.640
AND THEN I HUGGED HER,

20:40.640 --> 20:45.275
SO MY EARRING PROBABLY
GOT CAUGHT IN--IN HER...

20:45.275 --> 20:48.378
SPORTS BRA, AND WHEN SHE WENT
TO TAKE A BATH--

20:48.378 --> 20:51.451
HEY, DO YOU, UH,
WANNA HAVE SEX? (chuckles)

20:51.451 --> 20:54.784
SO GABY'S DRAIN,
ANGIE'S GARBAGE DISPOSAL,

20:54.784 --> 20:56.326
LYNETTE'S TOILET--

20:56.326 --> 20:59.389
I MEAN,
THE REALLY DIRTY SEX.

21:00.990 --> 21:03.633
SO NOW I HAVE TO RETURN
ALL THAT MONEY.

21:03.633 --> 21:06.366
NO, YOU DON'T. (sighs)

21:06.366 --> 21:09.268
I...

21:09.268 --> 21:10.870
GAVE IT TO THEM.

21:10.870 --> 21:13.703
YOU'RE SAYING
EVERYONE ON THE STREET KNOWS

21:13.703 --> 21:15.705
I'M HAVING FINANCIAL TROUBLE?

21:15.705 --> 21:19.008
WELL... (sighs) I THINK
THEY ALREADY FIGURED THAT OUT

21:19.008 --> 21:21.010
WHEN THEY SAW YOUR TRUCK
GET REPOSSESSED

21:21.010 --> 21:23.353
OUT OF OUR DRIVEWAY.

21:23.353 --> 21:25.385
THIS IS HUMILIATING, SUSAN.

21:25.385 --> 21:27.687
I'M SORRY, BUT IT ALL
COULD'VE BEEN PREVENTED

21:27.687 --> 21:31.421
IF YOU'D JUST LET ME MAKE A FEW
STUPID PAYMENTS ON YOUR TRUCK.

21:31.421 --> 21:33.423
I TOLD YOU,
I DON'T WANT YOUR HELP.

21:33.423 --> 21:35.825
THIS IS MY BUSINESS,
 MY PROBLEM.

21:35.825 --> 21:38.328
YOU KNOW, I DON'T REMEMBER
ALL THOSE "MYs"

21:38.328 --> 21:39.699
IN OUR WEDDING VOWS.

21:39.699 --> 21:42.001
IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE
A PARTNERSHIP.

21:42.001 --> 21:44.003
IF YOU CAN'T LET ME HELP YOU,

21:44.003 --> 21:46.005
MAYBE THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG
WITH OUR MARRIAGE.

21:46.005 --> 21:48.478
I'M NOT GONNA LISTEN TO THIS,
ALL RIGHT? I'M TIRED.

21:48.478 --> 21:50.480
I HAD A BUSY DAY
WASTING MY TIME.

21:50.480 --> 21:52.542
I'LL SLEEP ON THE COUCH.

21:52.542 --> 21:54.544
(sighs) OH.

22:08.898 --> 22:10.400
(sighs)

22:13.633 --> 22:15.635
(clatter in distance)

22:25.014 --> 22:26.546
DANNY?

22:26.546 --> 22:28.378
YOU UP THERE?

22:34.353 --> 22:35.785
(thud)

22:56.646 --> 22:59.679
(telephone rings)

22:59.679 --> 23:01.911
(sighs)
 (sets down vase)

23:01.911 --> 23:03.883
(ring)

23:03.883 --> 23:05.515
(beep)

23:05.515 --> 23:07.016
HELLO?

23:07.016 --> 23:10.019
OH, JEEZ, NICK, YOU SCARED ME.

23:10.019 --> 23:12.021
NOTHING. I JUST--
I JUST GOT HOME,

23:12.021 --> 23:15.525
AND I-I THOUGHT I HEARD A NOISE.
IT--NO, IT'S FINE.

23:15.525 --> 23:17.827
JUST HURRY HOME, OKAY?

23:17.827 --> 23:19.829
(beep)

23:28.608 --> 23:30.910
TO GABRIELLE SOLIS,
THE BEST NEIGHBOR

23:30.910 --> 23:34.013
TWO CHILDLESS, UPWARDLY MOBILE
GAY GUYS COULD EVER HAVE.
 MM.

23:34.013 --> 23:35.184
AW.
 (clink)

23:35.184 --> 23:37.186
(chuckles) I GOT IT.
 HEY!

23:37.186 --> 23:40.149
NO, NO, NO.
THAT WAS PURELY CEREMONIAL.

23:40.149 --> 23:43.422
WE DON'T WANT YOU DRINKING.
 WHY? DOES IT AFFECT
MY FERTILITY?

23:43.422 --> 23:46.826
THAT, AND YOU'RE KIND OF
A SLOPPY DRUNK.
 (chuckles)

23:46.826 --> 23:49.729
FINE. LET'S TALK BABIES.

23:49.729 --> 23:52.662
SO... WHAT ARE YOU GUYS
HOPING FOR--A BOY OR A GIRL?

23:52.662 --> 23:54.163
I WANT A GIRL.

23:54.163 --> 23:56.906
THAT WAY, WE CAN PUT HER
IN BABY BEAUTY PAGEANTS.

23:56.906 --> 23:59.909
YEAH, THEY'RE SO CUTE IN THEIR
MAKEUP AND RHINESTONE DRESSES.
 RIGHT?

23:59.909 --> 24:01.941
REALLY?
YOU GUYS GONNA DO THAT?

24:01.941 --> 24:04.944
WHY NOT?
 WELL, IT'S JUST I KIND OF
DABBLED IN THAT WORLD,

24:04.944 --> 24:08.618
AND FOR ME,
IT WAS A BIT MUCH.
 WELL, DON'T PANIC.
50% CHANCE IT'S A BOY.

24:08.618 --> 24:12.121
THEN IT'S MAKEUP
AND RHINESTONE VESTS.
 WHAT?!

24:12.121 --> 24:13.953
HE'S KIDDING.

24:13.953 --> 24:17.456
OH! HE BETTER BE. THERE'S NO WAY
I'M ALLOWING THAT.

24:17.456 --> 24:18.628
(laughs)

24:18.628 --> 24:20.960
MM, NOW THAT I THINK
ABOUT IT,

24:20.960 --> 24:23.493
I DO HOPE WE HAVE A BOY.

24:23.493 --> 24:25.695
AND WHY IS THAT?

24:25.695 --> 24:29.068
I ALREADY HAVE TWO GIRLS.
I'M SO SICK OF BUYING DRESSES.

24:29.068 --> 24:30.570
WHEN HE'S OLD ENOUGH,

24:30.570 --> 24:33.573
I'M GONNA TAKE HIM ON
THE BIGGEST SHOPPING SPREE EVER.

24:33.573 --> 24:35.074
(under breath) RIGHT.

24:37.176 --> 24:40.109
I GUESS YOU CAN DO THAT
WHEN WE COME BACK TO VISIT.

24:40.109 --> 24:43.112
VISIT? WHERE ARE YOU GOING?
 MY MOTHER LIVES
IN UPSTATE NEW YORK.

24:43.112 --> 24:45.615
WE THOUGHT WE'D MOVE
CLOSER TO HER

24:45.615 --> 24:48.157
SO THE BABY
CAN BE AROUND FAMILY.

24:48.157 --> 24:50.019
REALLY?

24:50.019 --> 24:52.261
IS THAT A PROBLEM?

24:52.261 --> 24:54.263
IT JUST NEVER OCCURRED TO ME

24:54.263 --> 24:57.496
THAT YOU GUYS WOULD LEAVE
AND TAKE MY ONLY SON.

24:59.529 --> 25:02.932
GABY...

25:02.932 --> 25:05.204
THIS CHILD--
IT'LL HAVE YOUR GENES,

25:05.204 --> 25:07.707
BUT IT WON'T BE YOURS.

25:07.707 --> 25:09.178
YOU GET THAT, RIGHT?

25:17.516 --> 25:19.619
OF COURSE.

25:19.619 --> 25:23.292
I MEAN, IT'S THE ONLY WAY
IT CAN WORK, RIGHT? (chuckles)

25:27.056 --> 25:31.100
(chuckles)

25:31.100 --> 25:33.803
(laughs)
 (Carlos)
COME ON. YOU READY?

25:33.803 --> 25:35.304
OKAY, NO PEEKING.

25:35.304 --> 25:37.536
(Juanita and Celia laugh)

25:37.536 --> 25:40.239
YOU GONNA BEAT ME AGAIN
THIS TIME?

25:42.271 --> 25:44.914
HEY, GUYS.

25:44.914 --> 25:46.776
WHAT?

25:46.776 --> 25:51.280
MOMMY, WHY DO YOU LOOK
SO SAD?

25:51.280 --> 25:54.283
WELL, I WAS JUST THINKING
ABOUT WHAT IT WOULD BE LIKE

25:54.283 --> 25:56.786
IF I COULDN'T
SEE YOUR FACE EVERY DAY...

25:56.786 --> 25:59.659
(voice breaks)
AND IT MADE ME SAD.

25:59.659 --> 26:01.631
WHAT'S GOING ON?

26:03.763 --> 26:05.564
(indistinct conversations)

26:05.564 --> 26:07.566
COME OUT OF THE KITCHEN.

26:07.566 --> 26:09.869
I WANT YOU TO SPEND SOME TIME
WITH THESE PEOPLE.

26:09.869 --> 26:11.871
MINGLE. HAVE A DRINK.

26:11.871 --> 26:14.573
(singsongy) I DON'T DRINK,
BRUCE. I'M AN ALCOHOLIC.
 ONE DRINK.

26:14.573 --> 26:16.305
I'M NOT ASKING YOU TO
SWING FROM THE CHANDELIER.

26:16.305 --> 26:18.307
(normal voice)
WHY ARE YOU SO NERVOUS?

26:18.307 --> 26:20.880
(exhales deeply)

26:20.880 --> 26:24.984
I REALLY PUT MY NECK ON THE LINE
FOR THIS BOOK, BREE.

26:24.984 --> 26:28.287
NO ONE LIKES THE IDEA.
NO ONE.

26:28.287 --> 26:30.860
OH, I SHOULD'VE STOPPED
AT JUST ONE DRINK.

26:30.860 --> 26:33.362
LOOK, THEY ARE GONNA
LOVE THE FOOD.

26:33.362 --> 26:35.064
I HOPE SO,

26:35.064 --> 26:37.296
BECAUSE IF THEY DON'T,
I DON'T SEE

26:37.296 --> 26:40.269
HOW YOU'RE GOING TO PUBLISH
ANOTHER BOOK OF ANY KIND.

26:40.269 --> 26:43.272
(sighs deeply)

26:45.775 --> 26:47.276
(man) HERE YOU ARE.

26:47.276 --> 26:51.641
(man) JUST PUT 'EM
ON A LITTLE PLATE.
 YEAH, THAT'LL BE FINE.

26:51.641 --> 26:54.343
HOP TO, PEOPLE.
THIS IS A BIG ONE.

26:54.343 --> 26:56.285
SOMETHING WRONG?
 WHAT'S THIS?

26:56.285 --> 26:58.888
IT'S THE SHERRY
WE DRIZZLE ON THE RIBS.

26:58.888 --> 27:01.250
THIS ISN'T SHERRY.
THIS IS VINEGAR.

27:01.250 --> 27:04.323
VINEGAR?

27:04.323 --> 27:05.825
OH, MY GOD.

27:05.825 --> 27:08.357
OH, MY GOD.

27:10.930 --> 27:14.263
(spits) IT'S RUINED.

27:14.263 --> 27:17.837
(spits) THEY'RE ALL RUINED.
IT'S DISGUSTING!

27:17.837 --> 27:20.209
THE FLOOR'S NOT LOOKING
SO GREAT EITHER.

27:20.209 --> 27:23.913
STOP!
WE CAN'T SERVE THIS FOOD.
 WE'VE ALREADY TAKEN OUT
MOST OF THE PLATES.

27:23.913 --> 27:26.275
WELL, DON'T JUST STAND THERE.
GO GET THEM BACK.

27:26.275 --> 27:28.277
HOW CAN IT BE VINEGAR?

27:28.277 --> 27:31.250
WE TESTED THE RECIPE LAST NIGHT,
AND IT WAS PERFECT,

27:31.250 --> 27:34.253
AND THEN I LOCKED THE SHERRY
IN THE LIQUOR CABINET.
 WHO HAD ACCESS?

27:34.253 --> 27:38.187
DID YOU GIVE ANDREW'S KEYS
TO ANYONE AFTER YOU FIRED HIM?
 HE NEVER RETURNED HIS KEY.

27:38.187 --> 27:40.229
OH, BREE.

27:40.229 --> 27:42.231
THEY WON'T GIVE THE PLATES BACK.

27:42.231 --> 27:44.333
THE PUBLISHER GUY'S GIVING
A LITTLE SPEECH,

27:44.333 --> 27:46.335
AND THEN THEY'RE GONNA EAT.
 NO, NO, NO, NO.

27:46.335 --> 27:49.338
I AM NOT GONNA LOSE
MY COOKBOOK CAREER OVER THIS.

27:49.338 --> 27:51.901
(sighs deeply and whispers) GOD.

27:56.405 --> 28:00.309
(whirring)

28:00.309 --> 28:03.753
HAND ME THAT TORCH.

28:03.753 --> 28:07.156
BON APPéTIT, EVERYBODY.

28:07.156 --> 28:10.359
(indistinct conversations)

28:10.359 --> 28:12.291
(alarm bell ringing)

28:12.291 --> 28:14.323
(screaming)

28:14.323 --> 28:17.326
(indistinct shouting)

28:22.171 --> 28:27.807
WE'RE SERVING COBBLER
IN THE PARKING LOT!

28:37.947 --> 28:39.248
(clang)

28:42.291 --> 28:45.194
I JUST MADE YOU
REAL HOT CHOCOLATE.

28:45.194 --> 28:46.956
DON'T I GET A SMILE?

28:46.956 --> 28:51.230
MY SON TRIED
TO RUIN MY CAREER TONIGHT.

28:51.230 --> 28:53.332
I DON'T THINK
I'LL EVER SMILE AGAIN.

28:53.332 --> 28:55.765
HONESTLY,

28:55.765 --> 28:58.507
I DON'T THINK ANDREW HAD
ANYTHING TO DO WITH IT.

28:58.507 --> 29:00.309
YOU DON'T?

29:00.309 --> 29:03.312
MNH. LOOK AT THE PLANNING
THAT WENT INTO IT.

29:03.312 --> 29:07.146
THE VINEGAR HAD TO BE
SUBSTITUTED FOR THE SHERRY

29:07.146 --> 29:09.148
AFTER YOU'D SELECTED
THE BOTTLE

29:09.148 --> 29:11.280
BUT BEFORE YOU'D LEFT
FOR THE EVENT.

29:11.280 --> 29:14.884
AND THE INGREDIENT HAD TO BE
SOMETHING YOU WOULDN'T SAMPLE.

29:17.186 --> 29:20.189
COME ON. ANDREW'S NOT
CLEVER ENOUGH TO PULL THAT OFF.

29:20.189 --> 29:23.262
HE CAN'T EVEN STEAL A CASE
OF WINE WITHOUT GETTING CAUGHT.

29:23.262 --> 29:25.895
WELL, THEN
WHO DO YOU THINK DID IT?

29:25.895 --> 29:29.338
WELL, IT'D HAVE TO BE
SOMEBODY PRETTY SMART...

29:29.338 --> 29:32.371
AT LEAST SMART ENOUGH
TO GET AN MBA.

29:32.371 --> 29:34.373
SAM? THAT'S RIDICULOUS.

29:34.373 --> 29:36.375
WHY WOULD HE WANT
TO HURT ME?

29:36.375 --> 29:38.848
WHO SAID
HE WANTED TO HURT YOU?

29:38.848 --> 29:41.450
ANDREW'S THE ONE
TAKING THIS FALL.

29:41.450 --> 29:44.513
NO, THAT'S NOT POSSIBLE.

29:44.513 --> 29:46.515
WHAT DOES HE STAND TO GAIN?

29:46.515 --> 29:50.519
HMM. WHAT A GOOD QUESTION.

29:50.519 --> 29:53.022
ENJOY YOUR CHOCOLATE.

29:57.366 --> 29:59.368
EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE,

29:59.368 --> 30:01.931
I CATCH SUSAN LOOKING AT ME
THIS CERTAIN WAY.

30:01.931 --> 30:05.274
YOU KNOW, I'M PUTTING
ON MY SHIRT OR MOWING THE LAWN.

30:05.274 --> 30:06.575
I'LL TURN MY HEAD,

30:06.575 --> 30:09.578
AND I'LL CATCH HER
WITH THIS LOOK IN HER EYES,

30:09.578 --> 30:13.412
AND I KNOW SHE'S THINKING
THAT SHE'S LUCKY TO HAVE ME.

30:13.412 --> 30:17.016
(scoffs)

30:17.016 --> 30:19.588
SO HOW CAN I TELL HER
I'M DEAD BROKE?

30:21.320 --> 30:24.223
HOW CAN I SAY,
"I CAN'T TAKE YOUR MONEY,

30:24.223 --> 30:26.495
"BECAUSE IT WON'T BEGIN TO COVER

30:26.495 --> 30:30.359
THE DEBTS I'VE BEEN RACKING UP
FOR THE LAST YEAR"?

30:30.359 --> 30:33.933
SHE THINKS
IT'S A COUPLE OF TRUCK PAYMENTS.

30:33.933 --> 30:36.435
SHE'S GOT NO IDEA.

30:36.435 --> 30:39.508
THIS WOULD REALLY HURT HER.

30:39.508 --> 30:42.571
IF SHE FOUND OUT
I KEPT THIS FROM HER,

30:42.571 --> 30:45.574
I DON'T THINK I'D EVER SEE
THAT LOOK FROM HER AGAIN...

30:47.316 --> 30:50.149
AND I CAN'T LET THAT HAPPEN.

30:50.149 --> 30:52.381
TELL ME HOW MUCH YOU NEED.

30:52.381 --> 30:54.984
(clicks pen)

30:54.984 --> 30:57.386
(sighs)

30:57.386 --> 31:00.259
(door bells jingle)

31:00.259 --> 31:01.290
(indistinct conversations)

31:01.290 --> 31:04.463
DOUBLE CAPP, EXTRA HOT,
RIGHT?

31:04.463 --> 31:07.296
WOW. GOOD MEMORY.

31:07.296 --> 31:10.069
I HAVEN'T SEEN YOU FOR A WHILE.
I THOUGHT MAYBE YOU LEFT TOWN.

31:10.069 --> 31:13.342
OH, I'M NOT LEAVING
TILL I FINISH MY BOOK.

31:13.342 --> 31:16.475
OH, RIGHT, YEAH.
HOW'S THAT GOIN'?

31:16.475 --> 31:18.978
DID THE GUY KILL HER?

31:20.579 --> 31:23.352
I TRIED TO WRITE IT
THAT WAY.

31:23.352 --> 31:26.155
HE WENT OVER THERE.
SHE WAS ALONE.

31:28.287 --> 31:31.060
HE HAD THE CHANCE.

31:31.060 --> 31:33.092
AND WHAT HAPPENED?

31:35.124 --> 31:37.426
JUST SEEMED TOO EASY.

31:38.527 --> 31:42.171
(chuckles)
SO YOU STUCK AGAIN?

31:42.171 --> 31:43.973
NO.

31:43.973 --> 31:46.035
I'VE GOT A BETTER IDEA.

31:46.035 --> 31:48.477
IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT,

31:48.477 --> 31:52.141
THE WORST PART OF WHAT SHE DID
WAS TAKING THE KID, RIGHT?

31:54.183 --> 31:57.216
SO I FIGURE

31:57.216 --> 32:01.220
THE BEST WAY FOR HIM
TO GET REVENGE...
 (door bells jingle)

32:01.220 --> 32:03.522
IS TO TAKE SOMETHING
FROM HER.

32:03.522 --> 32:07.356
BUT WHAT COULD HE TAKE THAT'S
GONNA BE AS BAD AS WHAT SHE DID?

32:09.398 --> 32:11.700
THE KID.

32:11.700 --> 32:14.633
(chuckles) HE'S GONNA
TAKE THE KID, RIGHT?

32:14.633 --> 32:17.967
THAT'S WHAT I'M THINKING.

32:17.967 --> 32:20.970
(birds chirping)

32:24.943 --> 32:27.146
HEY.

32:27.146 --> 32:30.219
HEY.

32:30.219 --> 32:33.122
SO I GUESS CARLOS TALKED
TO YOU GUYS?

32:33.122 --> 32:36.425
HE DID.

32:36.425 --> 32:40.129
(sighs) I FEEL AWFUL.

32:40.129 --> 32:43.132
THE MORE HE THOUGHT ABOUT IT,
HE JUST COULDN'T LET ME DO THIS.

32:43.132 --> 32:45.234
AND LET'S FACE IT,
HE DOES HAVE A SAY.

32:45.234 --> 32:48.237
IT'S COMPLETELY UNDERSTANDABLE,
GABY. IT WAS A LOT TO ASK.

32:48.237 --> 32:50.539
SO WHERE'S LEE?

32:50.539 --> 32:52.541
I WANNA TALK TO HIM, TOO.

32:52.541 --> 32:55.444
HE LEFT.

32:55.444 --> 32:58.707
LEFT?

32:58.707 --> 33:00.409
AFTER CARLOS CAME OVER,

33:00.409 --> 33:03.352
LEE AND I GOT
INTO YET ANOTHER FIGHT,

33:03.352 --> 33:05.014
AND...

33:05.014 --> 33:06.515
WE BROKE UP.

33:10.359 --> 33:12.191
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

33:12.191 --> 33:15.464
LEE SAYS HE CAN'T
GO THROUGH IT AGAIN.

33:15.464 --> 33:17.626
I'M DETERMINED
TO HAVE A CHILD,

33:17.626 --> 33:21.400
SO... (sighs)

33:21.400 --> 33:24.503
IS THERE ANYTHING I CAN DO?

33:27.076 --> 33:29.478
OH, RIGHT.

33:29.478 --> 33:31.480
SORRY.

33:31.480 --> 33:35.544
IT'S OKAY, GABY. LIKE I SAID,
IT WAS A LOT TO ASK.

33:52.401 --> 33:55.204
MY LEFT SHOE IS MISSING.
 WE'LL FIND IT.

33:55.204 --> 33:59.408
I CAN'T GET MARRIED
IN ONE SHOE.
 JUST GET DRESSED. THE WEDDING
STARTS IN HALF AN HOUR.

33:59.408 --> 34:01.470
HEY, MAYBE HE SHOULD
WEAR SNEAKERS.

34:01.470 --> 34:04.443
IT'D BE WILD,
LIKE HE'S TOO COOL TO CARE.

34:04.443 --> 34:07.076
OR I COULD--
I JUST HELP HIM KEEP LOOKING.

34:07.076 --> 34:09.178
THERE YOU GO.

34:09.178 --> 34:13.522
LYNETTE! HELP ME LOOK
FOR PRESTON'S SHOE!

34:13.522 --> 34:15.384
LYNETTE?

34:21.460 --> 34:23.391
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

34:23.391 --> 34:26.395
I NEED YOUR HELP.
PRESTON CAN'T FIND HIS SHOE.

34:26.395 --> 34:28.367
I PUT IT IN THE OVEN.

34:28.367 --> 34:29.638
WHY?

34:29.638 --> 34:31.699
BECAUSE THAT WOMAN
AT IMMIGRATION

34:31.699 --> 34:33.472
NEVER CALLED ME BACK,

34:33.472 --> 34:35.143
AND I AM SCREWED.

34:35.143 --> 34:37.846
OH, HONEY. COME ON.

34:37.846 --> 34:41.310
HIDING A SHOE ISN'T GONNA
STOP THEM FROM GETTING MARRIED.

34:41.310 --> 34:43.411
I KNOW. I JUST WANTED
A FEW MORE MINUTES

34:43.411 --> 34:47.186
BEFORE I HAD TO TELL MY SON
I'M NOT GOING TO HIS WEDDING.

34:47.186 --> 34:48.357
LYNETTE--

34:48.357 --> 34:50.489
I WILL NOT BE A HYPOCRITE,
TOM.

34:50.489 --> 34:52.460
I KNOW HOW YOU FEEL.
 (scoffs)

34:52.460 --> 34:54.862
BUT IF YOU THINK
IRINA'S GOT POWER NOW,

34:54.862 --> 34:58.127
JUST YOU WAIT UNTIL YOU DON'T
SHOW UP TO YOUR SON'S WEDDING.

34:58.127 --> 35:00.869
OH, I WISH...

35:00.869 --> 35:04.173
I WISH...
I WENT TO CHURCH MORE OFTEN.

35:04.173 --> 35:07.176
I COULD REALLY USE A FAVOR
FROM THE MAN UPSTAIRS

35:07.176 --> 35:09.178
RIGHT ABOUT NOW.

35:10.839 --> 35:12.311
(gears shift)

35:12.311 --> 35:13.842
MRS. SCAVO?

35:13.842 --> 35:16.415
YOU'RE NOT GONNA BELIEVE
WHAT I FOUND.

35:16.415 --> 35:18.547
(car door closes)
 I'LL SEE YOU SUNDAY MORNING.

35:30.799 --> 35:32.561
YOU LOOK BEAUTIFUL.

35:32.561 --> 35:35.404
MM. THANK YOU.

35:35.404 --> 35:38.367
I AM GUESSING
THIS ONE'S MUCH NICER

35:38.367 --> 35:40.809
THAN YOUR FIRST WEDDING DRESS,
YOU KNOW,

35:40.809 --> 35:43.212
WHEN YOU GOT MARRIED
IN RUSSIA TO...

35:43.212 --> 35:45.914
ALEXEI KOSOKOV?

35:50.519 --> 35:51.820
HERE IN AMERICA

35:51.820 --> 35:54.523
WE ACTUALLY GET DIVORCED
BEFORE WE GET MARRIED AGAIN,

35:54.523 --> 35:56.785
OTHERWISE YOU SPEND
YOUR HONEYMOON IN JAIL.

35:59.258 --> 36:00.729
ALEXEI TOLD ME

36:00.729 --> 36:03.692
IF I MARRY HIM,
HE WILL GIVE ME GOOD LIFE.

36:03.692 --> 36:05.794
BUT HE DIDN'T.

36:05.794 --> 36:07.736
HE NEVER WORKED.

36:07.736 --> 36:09.568
HE TREAT ME BADLY.

36:09.568 --> 36:12.571
NOW HE WON'T SIGN
THE DIVORCE PAPERS

36:12.571 --> 36:15.404
UNLESS I GIVE HIM MONEY.

36:15.404 --> 36:17.606
UH-HUH.

36:17.606 --> 36:19.248
OKAY.

36:19.248 --> 36:21.850
THAT EXPLAINS ALEXEI.

36:24.283 --> 36:25.514
WHAT ABOUT...

36:25.514 --> 36:27.656
THE GUY IN ITALY...

36:27.656 --> 36:31.360
WHO PRESSED CHARGES AFTER YOU
CLEANED OUT HIS BANK ACCOUNT?

36:34.263 --> 36:36.365
THAT GUY WAS A PIG.

36:36.365 --> 36:39.598
BELIEVE ME,
I EARNED EVERY PENNY.

36:39.598 --> 36:43.472
WE HAVE A TERM IN AMERICA
FOR WOMEN WHO GET PAID FOR SEX,

36:43.472 --> 36:46.735
AND IT'S NOT
"DAUGHTER-IN-LAW."

36:48.577 --> 36:51.280
YOU KNOW WHY
IT DOESN'T BOTHER ME

36:51.280 --> 36:53.282
THAT YOU DON'T LIKE ME?

36:53.282 --> 36:55.584
CAN'T WAIT.

36:55.584 --> 36:57.716
BECAUSE IT REALLY
DOESN'T MATTER.

36:57.716 --> 37:00.519
ALL THAT MATTERS

37:00.519 --> 37:03.422
IS THAT ONE HOUR FROM NOW,

37:03.422 --> 37:06.795
I WILL HAVE A RING
ON THIS FINGER,

37:06.795 --> 37:08.997
AND I WILL BE

37:08.997 --> 37:11.860
THE MOST IMPORTANT PERSON
IN HIS LIFE.

37:11.860 --> 37:16.465
SO GIVE PRESTON
YOUR LITTLE FILE.

37:16.465 --> 37:19.808
I WILL EXPLAIN IT ALL AWAY,

37:19.808 --> 37:22.641
AND HE WILL BELIEVE
EVERY WORD.

37:22.641 --> 37:24.543
HE ALWAYS DOES.

37:30.018 --> 37:32.921
PRESTON.

37:35.384 --> 37:36.985
MOM, DO YOU MIND?

37:39.257 --> 37:41.930
I NEED TO TALK TO IRINA.

38:12.661 --> 38:14.493
HI.

38:21.330 --> 38:25.604
YOUR FATHER TOLD ME
YOU CALLED OFF THE WEDDING.

38:25.604 --> 38:28.637
OBVIOUSLY, I THINK
YOU ARE DOING THE RIGHT THING.

38:30.839 --> 38:34.082
(voice breaking)
I KNOW YOU HATE ME RIGHT NOW,

38:34.082 --> 38:37.686
AND I JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW
THAT I AM OKAY WITH THAT.

38:37.686 --> 38:39.618
(sniffles)

38:47.756 --> 38:49.898
I LOVE YOU SO MUCH.

38:49.898 --> 38:52.501
I WOULD RATHER
HAVE YOU RESENT ME

38:52.501 --> 38:55.103
OR EVEN CUT ME OFF
COMPLETELY

38:55.103 --> 38:57.105
THAN TO ALLOW YOU
TO MAKE A MISTAKE

38:57.105 --> 39:00.509
THAT COULD RUIN YOUR LIFE.
SO GO AHEAD.

39:02.471 --> 39:04.773
HATE ME
FOR AS LONG AS YOU WANT,

39:04.773 --> 39:08.577
AND WHEN YOU ARE DONE,
I WILL BE HERE WAITING.

39:18.727 --> 39:20.929
MWAH. (sniffles)

39:22.831 --> 39:26.064
TRY NOT TO TAKE TOO LONG,
'CAUSE I MISS YOU ALREADY.

39:35.874 --> 39:37.506
HEY.

39:37.506 --> 39:39.578
HEY. WHERE YOU GOING?

39:39.578 --> 39:41.510
MOTEL,

39:41.510 --> 39:44.583
TILL I GET FLIGHT
OUT OF THIS HORRIBLE PLACE.

39:44.583 --> 39:47.085
WHAT? THE SCAVOS COULDN'T
EVEN GIVE YOU A LIFT?

39:47.085 --> 39:49.558
THAT'S HARSH.

39:49.558 --> 39:51.560
I WANT NOTHING
FROM THE SCAVOS.

39:51.560 --> 39:52.861
THEY'RE DEAD TO ME.

39:52.861 --> 39:55.424
LUCKY FOR YOU,

39:55.424 --> 39:58.026
I AM NOT A SCAVO.

40:00.669 --> 40:03.572
(chuckles)

40:03.572 --> 40:05.073
(sighs)

40:07.936 --> 40:11.139
SORRY ABOUT THE WEDDING.

40:11.139 --> 40:12.841
IT'S PRESTON'S LOSS, MAN.

40:12.841 --> 40:15.844
I MEAN, HE'LL NEVER GET
SOMEONE AS HOT AS YOU AGAIN.

40:15.844 --> 40:18.547
I DON'T WANT
TO TALK ABOUT IT.

40:18.547 --> 40:20.589
SURE.
YOU KNOW, I GET THAT.

40:22.521 --> 40:24.823
YOU KNOW,
IF YOU WANNA SAVE MONEY,

40:24.823 --> 40:27.556
YOU COULD--YOU COULD
ALWAYS SKIP THE MOTEL

40:27.556 --> 40:29.598
AND STAY AT MY PLACE.

40:29.598 --> 40:31.730
I DON'T THINK SO.

40:31.730 --> 40:34.603
NO, I PROMISE,
NO--NO FUNNY BUSINESS.

40:34.603 --> 40:36.104
I MEAN...

40:36.104 --> 40:38.166
UNLESS YOU WANT SOME.

40:38.166 --> 40:39.638
(chuckles)

40:39.638 --> 40:42.541
YEAH, I-I MEAN,
THINK OF IT AS A--

40:42.541 --> 40:45.514
AS A TRANSITION RELATIONSHIP.

40:45.514 --> 40:47.546
IT'LL HELP YOU
GET OVER PRESTON.

40:47.546 --> 40:50.148
I-I HAVE NO PROBLEM
LETTING YOU USE ME--

40:50.148 --> 40:51.680
OKAY, ENOUGH.

40:51.680 --> 40:54.723
I'M A LITTLE OUT OF YOUR LEAGUE,
DON'T YOU THINK?

40:54.723 --> 40:58.627
(chuckles) I MEAN,
I DIDN'T COME TO AMERICA

40:58.627 --> 41:02.090
TO END UP WITH SOME
GREASY-HAIRED LITTLE BOY.

41:02.090 --> 41:03.862
(laughs)

41:12.601 --> 41:15.644
(tires screech)

41:15.644 --> 41:17.976
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!

41:20.549 --> 41:22.651
EDDIE?

41:31.660 --> 41:34.523
(Irina screams,
Eddie grunting)

41:34.523 --> 41:36.625
(Irina chokes)

41:45.173 --> 41:48.807
WE ALL KNOW THAT EVIL EXISTS.

41:48.807 --> 41:52.611
THE NEWSPAPERS ARE FILLED
WITH STORIES

41:52.611 --> 41:56.845
ABOUT YOUNG GIRLS
WHO SUDDENLY VANISH.

41:56.845 --> 41:59.718
(engine starts)
 BUT WE DON'T PAY ATTENTION

41:59.718 --> 42:03.692
BECAUSE WE'RE WORRIED
ABOUT OUR MARRIAGES...

42:06.194 --> 42:10.959
CONCERNED ABOUT
OUR FRIENDSHIPS...

42:14.102 --> 42:18.737
ANXIOUS ABOUT OUR EMPLOYEES.

42:21.539 --> 42:25.814
YES, WE DON'T PAY ATTENTION
TO EVIL

42:25.814 --> 42:30.078
BECAUSE WE THINK IT WILL NEVER
COME TO OUR HOUSE.

42:30.078 --> 42:32.080
BUT IT DOES.

42:32.080 --> 42:35.624
HEY, MRS. SCAVO. I'M HERE
TO PICK UP PORTER FOR SCHOOL.

42:35.624 --> 42:36.685
AND SOMETIMES...

42:36.685 --> 42:38.186
HOW YOU DOIN'?

42:38.186 --> 42:39.628
GOOD.

42:39.628 --> 42:41.960
WE LET IT IN.
