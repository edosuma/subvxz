00:01.000 --> 00:02.093
Previously:

00:02.168 --> 00:03.726
(in German)

00:03.969 --> 00:05.767
(in German)

00:09.242 --> 00:11.676
- Who are you?
- It's a pity you'll never know.

00:14.080 --> 00:15.638
- Sydney...
- Vaughn...

00:15.715 --> 00:17.740
How did you...?

00:17.817 --> 00:21.947
Sloane is part of this. He works with
Prophet Five. It's my chance to stop him.

00:22.689 --> 00:26.625
- We expected to hear from you sooner.
- I ran into a few complications.

00:26.693 --> 00:29.059
And Sydney?

00:29.129 --> 00:30.289
She's dead.

00:32.832 --> 00:36.268
Langley can't know what Sydney's doing.
Continue to assume

00:36.336 --> 00:39.032
that Prophet Five
has moles inside the ClA.

00:39.105 --> 00:42.006
Michael Linds in Berlin
will arrange transport of the body.

00:42.075 --> 00:45.203
- I'll get right on it.
- Come with me. Anna's dead.

00:45.278 --> 00:47.974
Sydney has infiltrated Prophet Five.

00:48.048 --> 00:50.881
Sydney's presenting herself as Anna?
Is that wise?

00:50.950 --> 00:55.387
- Her call. I wasn't consulted. Your status?
- Be up and running in a minute.

00:55.455 --> 00:59.983
Sydney embedded a tracker into the chip
Anna had to retrieve. We can follow her.

01:00.060 --> 01:04.997
We suspect Prophet Five intended for
Anna to do a task only Sydney could do.

01:05.065 --> 01:08.228
It's our opportunity
to determine their endgame.

01:08.301 --> 01:11.099
- That's ifthey believe Sydney is Anna.
- I know.

01:11.171 --> 01:13.366
Patching Vaughn through.

01:14.607 --> 01:17.201
- (Marshall) Vaughn. can you hear me?
- You're clear.

01:17.277 --> 01:19.404
- Where is he?
- Hamburg.

01:19.479 --> 01:21.879
He and Sydney uncovered
a storeroom of data -

01:21.948 --> 01:25.714
material he and Renee's father gathered
while investigating Prophet Five.

01:25.785 --> 01:29.448
You'll join Vaughn, transmit the
documentation back here for analysis.

01:29.522 --> 01:32.116
Vaughn, it's Dixon.
It's good to hear your voice.

01:32.192 --> 01:34.387
You too. I'll see you soon.

01:34.461 --> 01:39.421
- Marshall, how we doing?
- Triangulating the coordinates. One sec.

01:39.499 --> 01:42.195
You know, I cried at your funeral.

01:42.268 --> 01:44.361
Uh, yeah, uh, sorry about that.

01:44.437 --> 01:48.601
No, no... thank you.
I need a good cry now and again.

01:51.144 --> 01:53.135
OK, tracker's hot.

01:53.746 --> 01:55.646
Got her. There she is.

01:57.984 --> 02:00.782
She's on Tiergartenstrabe.

02:05.258 --> 02:08.056
(Peyton) I have the chip in hand.

02:08.127 --> 02:10.619
Of course. We're en route now.

02:12.999 --> 02:17.026
Our superiors were quite pleased
with your performance.

02:17.103 --> 02:20.368
- You seem surprised.
- Not at all.

02:20.440 --> 02:23.568
Your reputation's well-deserved.

02:23.643 --> 02:25.838
To the great Anna Espinosa.

02:26.613 --> 02:29.605
Great seems a little strong, doesn't it?

02:29.682 --> 02:33.948
- Don't tell me you're getting modest?
- Hm. It's this body.

02:34.020 --> 02:37.649
I have this uncontrollable urge now
to act like a girl scout all the time.

02:37.724 --> 02:43.993
Well, let's get you back to Zurich
before you start trying to sell me cookies.

02:44.831 --> 02:47.800
I'm sure our superiors are eager
to get their hands on that.

02:47.867 --> 02:49.835
This?

02:49.903 --> 02:52.963
This is an inconvenience.
Nothing more.

02:55.175 --> 02:59.441
- What just happened?
- I'm not sure. I think the tracker crashed.

02:59.512 --> 03:02.106
- Cra... What does that mean?
- We've lost Sydney.

03:02.182 --> 03:04.980
- Find her.
- I can't. It must have fritzed out.

03:05.051 --> 03:09.010
- Patch into a traffic cam, just find her!
- Don't worry. I'm on it.

03:11.000 --> 03:17.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:18.765 --> 03:20.289
OK, I got her.

03:21.134 --> 03:23.864
- They're headed south on A7.
- The airport.

03:23.937 --> 03:27.839
Marshall, I'm headed east.
I'm gonna need directions.

03:27.907 --> 03:30.740
OK, give me a sec.
Left at the next intersection.

03:35.081 --> 03:38.539
- You're closing in.
- I'm gonna need a green light in a hurry.

03:38.618 --> 03:40.848
- It's all in German.
- Marshall!

03:40.920 --> 03:42.820
- "Anschlag"?
- "Grun" - green.

03:44.857 --> 03:46.722
(brakes screech)

03:59.105 --> 04:01.903
(PA announcements in German)

04:15.588 --> 04:17.077
Shall we?

04:24.797 --> 04:27.630
You finished the translation of page 47.

04:28.234 --> 04:34.230
The circle will be complete when the
Chosen One finds the rose in San Cielo.

04:34.307 --> 04:37.743
Congratulations, Mr. Sloane.
Thanks to your work,

04:37.810 --> 04:41.576
we're closer than ever to comprehending
Rambaldi's greatest mystery.

04:41.648 --> 04:45.414
You understand the meaning
of the deciphered message?

04:45.485 --> 04:49.319
Enough to proceed.
However, I do have one concern.

04:49.756 --> 04:54.352
Rambaldi's prophecies have always
taken into account the smallest variables.

04:54.427 --> 04:58.090
This is a man who predicted events
hundreds of years before we were born.

04:58.164 --> 05:02.464
The rose in question is indeed unique,
as unique as Sydney herself.

05:02.535 --> 05:08.337
What is unclear, however, is whether
Anna Espinosa posing as Sydney

05:08.408 --> 05:10.638
is able to complete the task.

05:11.244 --> 05:15.806
Well, then I guess
you've got your work cut out for you.

05:20.219 --> 05:22.210
After you.

05:28.461 --> 05:31.294
- Sloane's here.
- Of course.

05:31.364 --> 05:34.424
You didn't think we'd dispose of him
this soon, did you?

05:34.500 --> 05:37.435
I hear your mission was a success.

05:38.671 --> 05:42.630
- I should offer you congratulations.
- Thank you.

05:43.276 --> 05:45.540
Did you encounter any complications?

05:46.312 --> 05:49.679
Just one, but I've dealt with her
once and for all.

05:51.017 --> 05:53.918
We should celebrate, Arvin.

05:53.986 --> 05:55.977
Sydney Bristow is dead.

06:31.424 --> 06:33.984
Remarkable likeness, isn't it?

06:35.027 --> 06:39.361
So this is why you needed her.
Or should I say me?

06:40.633 --> 06:44.933
In his prophecies Rambaldi
referred to Sydney as the Chosen One.

06:45.004 --> 06:48.269
He foretold that she would
bring forth his final works.

06:48.341 --> 06:50.366
And you really believe that?

06:50.443 --> 06:55.005
That a man who lived 500 years ago
had intentions for Sydney Bristow?

06:56.582 --> 06:59.346
Excuse me. I may be mistaken,

06:59.419 --> 07:04.356
but I always believed you to be
a follower of Rambaldi's works.

07:05.124 --> 07:08.184
Only when it suits my checkbook.

07:08.261 --> 07:12.698
I'm not someone who'd guide my life
by some perverted sense of faith.

07:15.935 --> 07:19.427
As long as I have to look like this,
I might as well make some use of it.

07:19.505 --> 07:21.769
What does Rambaldi want me to do?

07:25.678 --> 07:31.082
Retrieve an artifact from San Cielo,
a monastery outside Rome.

07:32.251 --> 07:36.711
Monastery? That sounds fun.
Do I get to wear a habit?

07:36.789 --> 07:39.883
I think I've told you
all you need to know for now.

07:39.959 --> 07:42.792
We leave within the hour.

07:42.862 --> 07:45.524
Does this mean
you're sending me to my room?

07:45.598 --> 07:50.126
There's a change of clothes for you
upstairs. Second door on the left.

07:58.744 --> 08:02.840
Sadly, he did, yeah. Can you imagine
what happened when they got home?

08:02.915 --> 08:07.284
Can I steal you a sec? The new encryption
module for the coms - my math is wrong.

08:07.353 --> 08:11.119
- Go ahead. I can handle this.
- She'll be back in a sec.

08:13.292 --> 08:16.193
Didn't Langley just convert
all of our coms?

08:16.262 --> 08:19.095
- This isn't about the coms.
- What's going on?

08:19.799 --> 08:25.328
Last week when Sloane infiltrated the
network, I built a bot to monitor the servers.

08:26.405 --> 08:29.670
This morning a message came through
this office with no lD tags,

08:29.742 --> 08:32.404
intended for Allen Korman.

08:32.477 --> 08:36.005
- Korman? You mean the guy that...
- Yeah, him.

08:36.082 --> 08:40.883
Why would Tom be contacting a guy
who killed his wife? So I did some digging.

08:40.953 --> 08:44.320
Travel itinerary.
Korman's flying into LA tonight.

08:44.390 --> 08:48.520
This doesn't make any sense.
I talked to Tom myself.

08:48.594 --> 08:52.792
He went to confront Korman, but saw him
with his family and changed his mind.

08:52.865 --> 08:57.234
Rachel, Korman doesn't have any family.
I checked.

08:58.938 --> 09:00.963
Tom's been lying to you.

09:01.040 --> 09:04.942
I wanted to tell you first,
but I have to tell Mr. Bristow about this.

09:05.011 --> 09:07.104
- No, you don't.
- Yes, we have to.

09:07.179 --> 09:10.148
The contact is anonymous.
Tom is not a bad guy.

09:10.216 --> 09:13.674
- We don't know anything about him.
- Because I know.

09:16.822 --> 09:21.987
Look, just let me check into it first.
Give me 24 hours.

09:22.061 --> 09:27.124
I promise, if we don't have an answer
by then, we'll go to Jack together.

09:27.199 --> 09:29.667
All right. 24 hours.

09:32.305 --> 09:34.296
(humming)

09:42.415 --> 09:44.406
(hissing)

09:58.898 --> 09:59.990
(phone rings)

10:00.066 --> 10:02.626
- Hello?
- (Sydney) It's me. I don't have much time.

10:02.702 --> 10:05.398
- Where are you?
- Zurich, an estate, highly secure.

10:05.471 --> 10:07.735
- Sloane is here.
- What is he telling you?

10:07.807 --> 10:14.212
That page 47 references San Cielo, a
monastery near Rome. We're going there.

10:14.280 --> 10:17.943
- Where are you?
- In your kitchen, playing with lsabelle.

10:18.017 --> 10:20.918
You are? How is she?

10:20.987 --> 10:23.421
- Happy.
- (giggles and gurgles)

10:24.390 --> 10:28.724
- Dad, did she just...
- Giggle? Yeah. Apparently I'm funny.

10:29.395 --> 10:31.761
She hasn't done that before.

10:31.831 --> 10:33.958
That was a first.

10:35.134 --> 10:38.297
- Of which there will be many.
- I know.

10:39.572 --> 10:42.370
I'll notify Vaughn and Dixon about Rome.
If you learn...

10:42.441 --> 10:45.899
- (knocking)
- I have to go. Tell lsabelle I love her.

10:45.978 --> 10:48.446
- You ready?
- Yeah.

10:56.288 --> 10:58.256
Hey.

11:00.826 --> 11:02.418
Hey.

11:02.495 --> 11:04.622
You're shorter than I remember.

11:07.800 --> 11:11.930
- This is all regarding Prophet Five?
- This entire bunker contains evidence

11:12.004 --> 11:15.701
of mysterious deaths,
assassinations, car bombings.

11:15.775 --> 11:19.905
All of them involving people
who were investigating Prophet Five.

11:19.979 --> 11:24.040
- They killed anyone who got too close.
- But they didn't get you?

11:24.750 --> 11:26.945
They might have if not for Jack.

11:27.386 --> 11:31.755
In hospital he convinced me that Prophet
Five wouldn't rest until they killed me,

11:31.824 --> 11:34.725
and that I was
in no condition to fight back.

11:34.794 --> 11:37.820
- How'd he manage it?
- Sodium morphate.

11:37.897 --> 11:41.993
It slowed down my body functions
to a point that mimicked death.

11:42.068 --> 11:44.832
Apparently I spent four hours
in a drawer at the morgue

11:44.904 --> 11:49.204
waiting for Jack's contact to reach me
to administer the antidote.

11:49.275 --> 11:52.870
Then a couple days of traveling
before I made it to Nepal.

11:53.779 --> 11:58.842
You know, it's funny. It's the first time
I ever felt Jack accepted me.

11:58.918 --> 12:03.548
Or he manufactured an elaborate scheme
to postpone your wedding to his daughter.

12:03.622 --> 12:05.055
(laughs)

12:05.891 --> 12:07.916
I have something for you.

12:13.399 --> 12:16.334
Fortunately,
she looks more like her mother.

12:16.402 --> 12:19.064
Yeah. Yeah, she does.

12:20.873 --> 12:22.363
Dixon, thank you.

12:26.512 --> 12:28.173
(phone rings)

12:31.684 --> 12:34.244
Yeah, Jack. Of course.

12:35.454 --> 12:40.187
We'll contact you when we arrive.
Jack's sending in a team to box all this up.

12:40.259 --> 12:43.387
Sydney's en route with Sloane.
We're gonna provide backup.

12:43.462 --> 12:45.953
- Where are they headed?
- Rome.

12:52.972 --> 12:54.633
Anna.

12:56.275 --> 12:57.765
Well...

13:01.113 --> 13:06.016
I made our arrangements. Your contact
will be meeting you on the ground.

13:06.085 --> 13:10.044
He'll provide you with
access to San Cielo.

13:10.122 --> 13:12.556
No more than I need to know.

13:13.726 --> 13:17.389
Well, I'm sure you have questions.

13:19.198 --> 13:21.359
So do l.

13:22.334 --> 13:24.700
Tell me...

13:24.770 --> 13:26.601
how did it happen?

13:28.007 --> 13:30.100
How did I kill Sydney?

13:30.176 --> 13:33.942
- Yeah.
- Why do you care?

13:35.147 --> 13:37.445
Well...

13:37.516 --> 13:40.212
Sydney was a remarkable agent.

13:40.286 --> 13:42.413
I imagine it wasn't easy.

13:45.090 --> 13:47.650
Sydney wasn't a martyr or a legend.

13:47.726 --> 13:50.058
She was just a person...

13:51.363 --> 13:55.595
who deserved nothing more
than to be shot in the back.

13:56.569 --> 13:58.594
And so she was.

14:00.606 --> 14:02.369
The Chosen One.

14:03.442 --> 14:06.707
She died just as easy as anyone.

14:08.647 --> 14:10.638
I see.

14:11.450 --> 14:13.611
Well, thank you.

14:16.355 --> 14:18.619
We'll be landing shortly.

14:32.638 --> 14:36.870
I know what you have planned for Anna
after this mission is over.

14:36.942 --> 14:38.807
You have reservations?

14:40.179 --> 14:42.170
Oh, no.

14:43.048 --> 14:45.778
I want to be the one who kills her.

15:15.648 --> 15:17.912
You smell nice.

15:19.184 --> 15:22.881
So we looked into the Monastery
San Cielo. You sure about that name?

15:22.955 --> 15:26.516
- Yeah. Why?
- Marshall couldn't find any record of it.

15:27.293 --> 15:31.730
I'm meeting someone inside the OTB.
He's supposed to brief me on the rest.

15:33.198 --> 15:35.496
I saw a picture of lsabelle.

15:36.435 --> 15:38.903
I don't know how we do this anymore.

15:39.638 --> 15:42.630
We do it the way we've always done it.

15:42.708 --> 15:45.142
It's the only way to keep her safe.

15:45.210 --> 15:47.201
We end this.

15:51.050 --> 15:52.711
OK.

15:54.586 --> 15:58.750
Dixon and I will have your back.
If anything happens, we'll pull you out.

15:58.824 --> 16:04.456
- So who is this contact?
- Sloane said I'd know him when I saw him.

16:04.530 --> 16:06.430
Syd, be careful.

16:12.771 --> 16:15.968
(sport announcements on TV in Italian)

16:29.922 --> 16:32.652
(Sark) I wouldn't do that if I were you.

16:32.725 --> 16:37.526
If you want my advice, I'd take Tokyo Rose
in the third. It's a sure bet.

16:37.596 --> 16:40.690
Julian. Last time
I saw you was Venice.

16:42.534 --> 16:46.470
Where, as I recall,
you betrayed me to the ClA.

16:46.538 --> 16:49.837
- They took me into custody.
- And yet, Anna,

16:49.908 --> 16:52.968
here you are,
looking better than ever.

16:56.415 --> 17:00.215
That's for a year spent in
a federal holding facility.

17:00.586 --> 17:02.816
(in Italian)

17:08.926 --> 17:11.020
What was that one for?

17:11.096 --> 17:13.223
I'll get back to you.

17:13.298 --> 17:14.959
Right.

17:15.968 --> 17:18.800
So, what are you drinking?

17:26.878 --> 17:29.347
- Did you find him?
- The Cardinal?

17:30.449 --> 17:33.316
I wouldn't be here if I didn't.

17:58.277 --> 18:00.609
I'm gonna give you to three
to start talking.

18:00.679 --> 18:03.842
Not here.
Somebody might be watching.

18:15.894 --> 18:19.227
I didn't lie to you.
Korman killed my wife.

18:19.298 --> 18:22.028
But the order
came from somebody else.

18:22.101 --> 18:24.899
Closest I've gotten is a name.
The Cardinal.

18:25.337 --> 18:28.397
Well, you two
seem to be pretty chummy.

18:28.474 --> 18:30.567
He works freelance.

18:30.642 --> 18:34.043
We did a job once - deep-cover op.

18:34.980 --> 18:37.471
He doesn't even know my real name.

18:37.549 --> 18:40.950
Look, I've gotta find out why, Rachel.

18:42.588 --> 18:44.681
She was a schoolteacher.

18:45.757 --> 18:48.123
She wasn't a part of this life.

18:49.027 --> 18:52.986
If somebody wanted to hurt me,
why didn't they just come after me?

18:53.932 --> 18:55.900
And Korman knows?

18:55.968 --> 18:58.061
He does now.

18:58.137 --> 18:59.832
He found the Cardinal.

18:59.905 --> 19:02.601
What does he want? Money?

19:02.674 --> 19:06.474
His car. It was seized
when he turned himself in to WlTSEC.

19:07.212 --> 19:10.147
You could have told me, Tom.
I would have kept it to myself.

19:10.215 --> 19:12.911
No. I couldn't have.

19:12.985 --> 19:18.082
I spent four years, and this is
as close as I've got to an answer.

19:19.024 --> 19:21.458
I couldn't trust anybody.

19:28.333 --> 19:32.463
If I hack into the federal database,
I should be able to find the car.

19:32.538 --> 19:35.234
I couldn't ask you to do that.

19:35.307 --> 19:37.002
You didn't.

19:50.489 --> 19:52.719
It's Sark.

19:52.791 --> 19:55.089
Her contact?

19:55.160 --> 19:56.855
Yep.

19:57.896 --> 20:00.763
Better the enemy you know.

20:00.832 --> 20:02.663
She can handle Sark.

20:07.773 --> 20:09.638
Another?

20:09.708 --> 20:12.677
Perhaps you shouldn't.
We're on the clock.

20:12.744 --> 20:17.238
We are? Here I thought
we were just catching up on old times.

20:18.283 --> 20:21.946
In that case, maybe it's time
you fill me in on the plan.

20:22.020 --> 20:25.751
- What has Sloane told you?
- Just that our target is San Cielo.

20:25.824 --> 20:28.054
That's not entirely true.

20:28.126 --> 20:31.823
The rose you're supposed to acquire,
if you're to believe page 47,

20:31.897 --> 20:35.298
is being held in a facility
known by Rambaldi as San Cielo.

20:35.367 --> 20:39.701
The rest of the world now refers to it
as La Fossa Maximum Security Prison.

20:39.771 --> 20:42.399
We're breaking into a prison?

20:42.474 --> 20:47.468
According to Sloane, Rambaldi, in the days
leading up to his execution, was held there.

20:47.546 --> 20:51.710
He believes he hid the rose
in the northwest isolation wing.

20:52.150 --> 20:56.587
The text specifies only the Chosen One
can obtain the item in question.

20:58.890 --> 21:01.688
I guess you'll have to do.

21:06.298 --> 21:08.095
(in Italian)

21:24.316 --> 21:26.307
An explosion?

21:28.720 --> 21:31.553
I suggest you take cover.

21:33.425 --> 21:35.222
(beeping)

21:45.203 --> 21:48.468
(in Italian)

22:01.386 --> 22:05.117
Wait, this is your plan
for getting us into La Fossa?!

22:05.190 --> 22:07.181
Yes. Grazie.

22:08.393 --> 22:10.861
Follow my lead, will you?

22:15.167 --> 22:17.465
(in Italian)

22:52.404 --> 22:55.168
- Have you accessed the prison's network?
- Not yet.

22:55.240 --> 22:57.538
Vaughn and Dixon
are in the sewers now.

22:57.609 --> 23:01.909
The prison internet connection runs
through a junction box. It'll be vulnerable.

23:03.048 --> 23:05.778
- Merlin, are you there?
- Yeah. Vaughn. go ahead.

23:05.851 --> 23:08.581
We're 70 meters in.
Still no sign of the junction box.

23:08.653 --> 23:11.383
You're almost under the switch room.
You're close.

23:11.456 --> 23:14.289
Got it. It's a standard lPX node.

23:14.359 --> 23:18.352
- You should be able to access the feeds.
- Doing that now.

23:18.430 --> 23:24.733
Do it quickly. I don't like the idea of Sydney
being in prison with Sark as her backup.

23:44.556 --> 23:46.717
(in Italian)

23:56.768 --> 23:59.293
Lucky for you
I won't be here for long,

23:59.371 --> 24:02.431
otherwise I'd pull out your tongue
and choke you with it.

24:06.111 --> 24:08.102
(coughs)

24:11.983 --> 24:14.383
(gasps for breath)

24:16.621 --> 24:18.714
(in Italian)

24:35.040 --> 24:38.168
Do you realize we just broke
about a half-dozen federal laws?

24:38.243 --> 24:42.009
Unless they moved it,
Korman's car should be down this aisle.

24:46.051 --> 24:49.680
Look, just stay low,
check for VlN numbers.

24:49.754 --> 24:52.188
You ready? Let's go.

24:57.762 --> 24:59.957
This is it.

25:02.667 --> 25:04.999
This shouldn't take long.

25:05.070 --> 25:08.267
- Can I help?
- Yeah, just keep an eye out for the guard.

25:19.584 --> 25:24.146
Is there any reason you're connecting
the carburetor to the intake tube?

25:24.222 --> 25:26.986
- Is this the carburetor?
- Yeah.

25:27.058 --> 25:30.653
Maybe I should keep an eye out
for the guard.

25:33.798 --> 25:39.134
- All right, you should be tied in now.
- Yeah, we're hot. Getting a picture?

25:39.204 --> 25:43.800
Copy. It's coming through.
See if you can isolate the women's block.

25:43.875 --> 25:47.003
Wait, was that...
Is that the women's showers?

25:47.078 --> 25:48.909
No, that's men. Definitely men.

25:50.849 --> 25:53.181
There she is.

25:54.185 --> 25:58.485
Wait a minute. She's in isolation.
You think that's part of her plan?

25:58.557 --> 26:00.491
We have to hope so.

26:00.926 --> 26:03.053
(man) Eccolo. Andiamo!

26:04.095 --> 26:05.892
Si. questo e bene.

26:06.031 --> 26:08.056
(in Italian)

26:26.751 --> 26:29.242
Marshall, what happened?
Did we lose the signal?

26:29.321 --> 26:34.020
I don't know. We've been kicked out.
Looks like somebody else tried to hack in.

26:34.092 --> 26:35.582
Sark.

26:35.660 --> 26:38.424
Any way to regain our tap?
We have to keep track of her.

26:38.496 --> 26:42.262
You could look for the alarm lines
and then try to cross-wind 'em.

26:42.334 --> 26:45.132
- Know what he's talking about?
- 50%.

26:47.606 --> 26:48.595
(beeping)

26:48.673 --> 26:50.664
(door unlocks)

27:08.927 --> 27:10.258
(weak moaning)

27:15.300 --> 27:17.564
(chatter)

27:25.276 --> 27:26.436
Sark, where are you?

28:27.505 --> 28:29.700
(gasps)

28:34.879 --> 28:40.078
I've been waiting for you
for a very long time.

28:45.824 --> 28:48.224
You have me confused
with someone else.

28:48.293 --> 28:49.954
Hm.

28:50.028 --> 28:54.863
I can't imagine confusing you
with anyone else.

28:56.267 --> 29:00.465
As difficult as this must be
for you to understand,

29:02.107 --> 29:04.098
I know you.

29:04.743 --> 29:06.404
We've never met.

29:06.478 --> 29:09.345
No, we haven't.

29:10.548 --> 29:13.142
We don't have much time.

29:13.218 --> 29:15.152
Come with me.

29:15.220 --> 29:19.088
I'm not going anywhere with you
unless you tell me who you are.

29:24.929 --> 29:28.421
The circle will be complete

29:28.500 --> 29:32.266
when the Chosen One finds the rose.

29:38.643 --> 29:41.305
I am the rose.

29:45.016 --> 29:46.950
Now,

29:47.018 --> 29:49.282
if you will come with me.

29:54.092 --> 29:57.493
And, Mr. Harvey,
how can I help you?

29:58.029 --> 30:02.659
You have two suspects in custody
who are wanted fugitives from my country,

30:02.734 --> 30:06.101
and we'd like to have them extradited,
with your permission.

30:06.171 --> 30:10.403
- Then I'm afraid we have a problem.
- Why is that, sir?

30:10.475 --> 30:14.707
These two have committed crimes
on ltalian land

30:14.779 --> 30:20.684
and I cannot possibly release them
before their first judicial hearing.

30:21.319 --> 30:25.085
But you could release them with
the permission of the general prosecutor,

30:25.156 --> 30:26.646
Adriana Macelli.

30:29.127 --> 30:32.995
Well, yes, of course.
But Signora Macelli...

30:33.064 --> 30:36.090
Mrs. Macelli is expecting your call.

30:47.312 --> 30:50.577
Pronto. Procuratrice Macelli.

30:50.648 --> 30:53.412
Signora Macelli. Buongiorno.

30:56.921 --> 31:00.288
Well, looks like we may be almost there.

31:03.294 --> 31:05.854
I was supposed to meet her.

31:05.930 --> 31:08.865
- Who?
- My wife.

31:10.702 --> 31:12.795
When she died.

31:15.707 --> 31:18.608
It was our half-year anniversary.

31:19.510 --> 31:22.968
I was gonna pick her up at work...

31:23.047 --> 31:25.538
take her out to dinner.

31:27.418 --> 31:29.750
But contact called.

31:31.890 --> 31:34.051
I never made it.

31:36.027 --> 31:41.932
I was working five investigations,
and maybe I screwed up,

31:42.000 --> 31:44.332
got my stories confused.

31:47.005 --> 31:49.838
Maybe somebody from my past...

31:51.743 --> 31:53.734
Revenge.

31:56.114 --> 31:58.241
I don't know.

31:59.150 --> 32:01.641
You'll find out soon enough.

32:04.522 --> 32:07.013
Thanks for doing this.

32:08.526 --> 32:14.863
Honestly, this is the closest thing I've had
to a night out since I joined the ClA.

32:20.271 --> 32:23.365
Wanna hop in
and give me some gas?

32:26.911 --> 32:29.243
(engine starts)

32:30.381 --> 32:32.372
Hey!

33:05.216 --> 33:07.150
Who did this?

33:07.218 --> 33:09.652
You don't need me to tell you.

33:12.323 --> 33:15.622
He told me you'd be coming.

33:15.693 --> 33:19.527
All! hadtodowaswait.

33:38.149 --> 33:41.516
This is yours for the time being.

33:53.297 --> 33:55.561
What is it?

33:55.633 --> 33:57.760
His greatest gift

33:57.835 --> 34:01.327
and also his greatest curse.

34:02.407 --> 34:05.171
- Meaning?
- What you hold in your hand

34:05.243 --> 34:09.043
is simply defiance
of the natural order.

34:14.985 --> 34:18.581
The end of nature itself.

34:19.157 --> 34:23.150
Some very bad people
want what's in this amulet.

34:23.226 --> 34:26.161
I can't stop them
if you don't tell me what it is.

34:26.731 --> 34:28.995
You don't understand.

34:29.067 --> 34:31.228
You can't stop them.

34:32.503 --> 34:34.766
You don't know me very well.

34:34.839 --> 34:37.103
Hm.

34:37.175 --> 34:41.440
You're more charming
than I could have imagined.

34:43.514 --> 34:49.453
I used to believe as you do
that there were decisions to be made.

34:49.520 --> 34:51.681
But in the end

34:51.755 --> 34:54.418
it's just fate.

34:56.159 --> 35:01.860
It's out of our hands,
and now it's just a matter of time.

35:02.967 --> 35:05.561
Amatteroftime untilwhat?

35:06.604 --> 35:09.596
Until the stars fall from the sky,

35:09.674 --> 35:12.370
until the end of light.

35:16.848 --> 35:19.510
You have gotten
what you came for.

35:19.584 --> 35:23.611
The guards will be making rounds soon.
You need to go.

35:24.789 --> 35:28.225
- Will you be all right?
- Hm...

35:28.292 --> 35:31.284
I'm not a part of the battle to come.

35:31.896 --> 35:33.625
Go!

35:41.606 --> 35:44.598
- Dixon, I got her!
- I'll call you back.

35:46.978 --> 35:49.105
She's heading to the women's block.

35:49.180 --> 35:52.741
She must have got what she came for.
Maybe she's headed for extraction.

35:57.889 --> 36:01.290
Good luck with this one.
He's all yours.

36:02.493 --> 36:04.484
Thank you.

36:07.331 --> 36:09.060
Where's Anna?

36:09.133 --> 36:11.260
Annawon'tbejoining us.

36:19.610 --> 36:21.544
Were you successful?

36:24.448 --> 36:26.780
Tell me, Anna,

36:27.652 --> 36:30.086
did you retrieve the rose?

36:30.154 --> 36:33.385
No. There was nothing there.

36:36.327 --> 36:38.625
I don't believe you.

36:38.696 --> 36:40.323
(moans)

36:51.576 --> 36:54.545
Sydney deserved better
than an anonymous bullet.

36:57.048 --> 37:00.814
You didn't even have the courage
to face her.

37:01.219 --> 37:03.483
At least I'll look you in the eye.

37:12.530 --> 37:15.624
- Marshall, talk to me!
- There's a grate into the iso ward.

37:15.700 --> 37:18.066
No time.
We need to distract Sloane.

37:22.306 --> 37:25.833
Their surveillance feed - can we use it
to get into security controls?

37:25.910 --> 37:27.207
Marshall, hurry!

37:29.647 --> 37:32.411
- Got it.
- (alarm)

37:36.387 --> 37:38.787
I don't die that easy.

37:42.126 --> 37:46.529
Sir? We've had a breach.
You better get out of here.

37:48.099 --> 37:50.533
Stay in your cell. Stay back!

37:55.473 --> 37:57.566
(gunshot)

37:59.810 --> 38:01.539
Sydney, you OK?

38:02.947 --> 38:05.347
Yeah. Let's get outta here.

38:21.032 --> 38:24.729
- Thank you.
- Why was the hit ordered on my wife?

38:25.369 --> 38:29.430
- If I tell you, you'd never let me walk away.
- You have my word.

38:30.541 --> 38:32.338
I don't believe you.

38:33.611 --> 38:35.841
Go ahead.

38:35.913 --> 38:38.074
Shoot me.

38:38.149 --> 38:40.743
First tell me why she had to die.

38:42.820 --> 38:46.950
Truth is she was just
in the wrong place at the wrong time.

38:47.024 --> 38:49.720
- I don't understand.
- My information said

38:49.794 --> 38:54.424
you were picking her up at her job.
I was waiting at the bottom of the stairs.

38:55.700 --> 38:58.794
You were supposed to be with her.

38:58.869 --> 39:01.167
It was a mistake.

39:01.238 --> 39:04.435
She died because
I thought she was you.

39:05.609 --> 39:09.705
I'm going to disappear now.
If you come after me I will know,

39:09.780 --> 39:13.944
and I'll do what I set out to do
four years ago.

39:24.995 --> 39:26.326
(beeping)

39:50.621 --> 39:55.354
- This is pretty amazing.
- Have you ever seen anything so perfect?

39:55.926 --> 39:57.985
No.

39:58.062 --> 40:00.326
You did good.

40:06.604 --> 40:08.162
Thanks.

40:09.407 --> 40:13.434
- You're gonna be just like your mom.
- Oh, I hope not.

40:13.511 --> 40:17.447
I hope she's
a doctor or a teacher,

40:17.515 --> 40:22.248
or just anything that does not involve
wearing a wig.

40:22.319 --> 40:26.551
I don't know. I think she'd look pretty cute
in a little pink wig.

40:27.458 --> 40:29.926
Maybe not.

40:34.932 --> 40:36.695
You OK?

40:36.767 --> 40:39.361
Yeah, it's just...

40:39.437 --> 40:41.871
I'm still a little sore, I guess.

40:46.877 --> 40:50.335
- We came so close, Vaughn.
- Sydney...

40:50.414 --> 40:54.851
Sloane, Prophet Five -
they're still out there.

40:54.919 --> 40:56.079
Hey.

40:56.153 --> 40:59.145
I thought we agreed
tonight it's just us, OK?

41:01.325 --> 41:03.589
(Isabelle snores)

41:03.661 --> 41:07.563
Oh, my God.
All right, the snoring, it kills me.

41:12.536 --> 41:14.527
(phone rings)

41:28.619 --> 41:30.985
- Hello?
- (Sloane) It was you. Sydney.

41:31.055 --> 41:34.456
Of course.
How could I have ever thought otherwise?

41:34.525 --> 41:39.053
I saw it in you the first time we met.
You're a survivor. just like me.

41:39.129 --> 41:43.293
And now. thanks to you.
I have everything I need.

42:20.604 --> 42:22.128
(children) Bad robot!

42:23.305 --> 42:29.180
