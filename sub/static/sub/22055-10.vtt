like two dishes.

00:28.649 --> 00:29.995
I'm at a disadvantage,
unfortunately.

00:30.099 --> 00:31.617
She puts herself

02:14.824 --> 02:16.998
Van left, that
was very unexpected.

02:17.102 --> 02:18.621
It really doesn't
make any sense.

02:18.724 --> 02:20.381
Barbie should have
definitely gone home.

02:20.485 --> 02:22.280
I want Barbie to go
home, but not bad enough

02:22.383 --> 02:23.350
to throw a dinner service.

02:23.453 --> 02:24.765
She'll do that to herself.

What?

03:01.077 --> 03:02.975
You don't think Barbie's nuts?

03:03.079 --> 03:04.114
That's not normal!

03:06.186 --> 03:07.946
ELISE: Especially
when you're like 50.

03:08.049 --> 03:09.154

04:57.469 --> 04:59.506
Like, I haven't tastedevery spice in the world.

04:59.609 --> 05:01.508
But Chef Ramsay
has loved my food,

05:01.611 --> 05:03.682
so I'm confident with my palate.

05:03.786 --> 05:05.374
GORDON RAMSAY: But
there is one more thing.

05:05.477 --> 05:06.720
Oh god.

05:21.459 --> 05:23.495
your teammate will stay clean.

05:23.599 --> 05:27.119
But if you fail,
and get two wrong,

05:27.223 --> 05:30.985
your teammate will beblasted with mashed potato.

05:31.089 --> 05:32.815

Gravy.

05:33.816 --> 05:34.817

So you have shovels, buckets,all your cleaning supplies

15:04.282 --> 15:05.525

15:05.628 --> 15:08.873
WOMAN: And, uh, we have acouple more tasks after that.

15:08.977 --> 15:10.254
WOMAN: Can we put
it in the middle?

15:10.357 --> 15:12.359
WOMAN: This is disgusting.

15:12.463 --> 15:13.671
Ew, why does it smells so bad?

15:13.774 --> 15:14.914
I don't know.

15:15.017 --> 15:18.607
I just took a shower, andnow I have to get, like,

15:18.710 --> 15:21.368
ankle deep in this gravy again.

15:21.472 --> 15:24.302
Mmm, dinner.

15:24.406 --> 15:27.340
ANNOUNCER: While the red teamis steeped in punishment--

15:27.443 --> 15:29.100
This is disgusting.

15:29.204 --> 15:32.586
ANNOUNCER: --the blue team isreaping their rewards at Roy's.

15:32.690 --> 15:33.760

15:33.863 --> 15:34.830
ROBYN: What?

15:34.934 --> 15:35.727

15:35.831 --> 15:37.177
MAN: Oh my god!

15:37.281 --> 15:38.144
Wow.

15:38.247 --> 15:40.422
WOMAN: Whoa!

15:48.982 --> 15:50.846
MILLY: I've never beentreated this good in my life.

15:50.950 --> 15:53.676
I missed out on a
Vitamix on season 14.

15:53.780 --> 15:55.333
I come back and I
win the Vitamix.

15:55.437 --> 15:57.197
I'm happy as shit.

15:57.301 --> 15:58.578

He dropped a crazyspread for the blue team.

WOMAN: Look at this asparagus.

16:10.762 --> 16:11.729
MAN: Oh my gosh.

16:11.832 --> 16:13.834
MILLY: It's lobster
stuffed with crab.

16:13.938 --> 16:16.699
It's sushi all over the
place, beef tenderloin.

16:16.803 --> 16:18.667
This is looking good.

16:18.770 --> 16:20.945
Oh, man, pina coladas.

16:21.049 --> 16:22.050
ROBYN: Yummy.

16:22.153 --> 16:23.361
I really love sea food.

16:23.465 --> 16:25.501
It is crazy, Roy.

16:25.605 --> 16:26.813
Roy's killed it.

16:26.916 --> 16:28.332
NICK: At least we canappreciate it because we know

16:28.435 --> 16:29.712
what food tastes like, right?
- Yeah.

16:29.816 --> 16:31.197
MILLY: Oh, man.
MAN: Burn.

16:31.300 --> 16:32.301
[laughing]

16:32.405 --> 16:34.131
ROBYN: Damn, it feels
really good to win.

16:34.234 --> 16:35.442
Again, four times in a row.

16:35.546 --> 16:37.651
MILLY: We crushed them bad.

16:37.755 --> 16:38.549
Mmm hmm.

16:38.652 --> 16:39.446
MILLY: Like bad, bad.

16:39.550 --> 16:40.344
Boop.

16:40.447 --> 16:41.345
[laughing]

16:41.448 --> 16:43.312
Robyn beat them,
just by herself.

16:43.416 --> 16:46.591
I'm going to make sure thatI rub it in their face good.

16:46.695 --> 16:48.145
Damn, red team, y'all suck.

16:48.248 --> 16:49.387
Let's have a great
service tonight.

16:49.491 --> 16:50.768
You guys are awesome.

16:50.871 --> 16:51.838
We can do it together.

16:51.941 --> 16:52.735
Yes.

16:52.839 --> 16:55.497
Cheers, guys.

16:55.600 --> 16:58.569
To the peppercorns.

16:58.672 --> 17:01.675
This is like picking aneedle out of a haystack.

17:01.779 --> 17:03.332
I think this is our
worst punishment yet.

17:03.436 --> 17:04.644
I think it is.

17:04.747 --> 17:05.541
How about Van yesterday?

17:05.645 --> 17:06.473
That was deep.

17:06.577 --> 17:07.371
That just goes to show you.

17:07.474 --> 17:08.544
It don't matter what you say.

17:08.648 --> 17:10.063
Chef Ramsay could pick anybody.

17:10.167 --> 17:11.892
DANA: He wasn't the one thatshould of went home though.

17:11.996 --> 17:13.204
Who do you think
should of went home?

17:13.308 --> 17:15.724
Barbie.

17:15.827 --> 17:18.658
BARBIE: Guess it's a goodthing chef didn't think that.

17:18.761 --> 17:20.039
Right.

17:20.142 --> 17:23.111
The red team doesn't have myfront, doesn't have my back.

17:23.214 --> 17:24.767
They don't have nothing for me.

17:24.871 --> 17:26.907
So I'm just going
to focus on me.

17:27.011 --> 17:29.358
Wasn't trying to open nocan of worms with that one.

17:29.462 --> 17:30.359
That's fine.

17:30.463 --> 17:31.671
I'm not scared to
state my opinion.

17:31.774 --> 17:33.155
And I'm not scared
to defend myself.

17:33.259 --> 17:34.053
Good for you.

17:34.156 --> 17:34.950
[scoffing]

17:35.951 --> 17:37.608
Holy fucking shit, Michelle.

17:37.711 --> 17:38.574
Like, damn!

17:38.678 --> 17:39.920
Barbie doesn't trust Michelle.

17:40.024 --> 17:41.646
Michelle doesn't trust Barbie.

17:41.750 --> 17:43.855
Unfortunately they need totrust each other in order to get

17:43.959 --> 17:45.271
through dinner service tonight.

17:45.374 --> 17:46.789
Well, yesterday is yesterday.

17:46.893 --> 17:47.756
Today is today.

17:47.859 --> 17:49.275
And we'll see what
happens tonight.

17:49.378 --> 17:50.207
Oh.

17:50.310 --> 17:51.070
All right.

17:52.519 --> 17:53.934
Who promises?

17:54.038 --> 17:55.246
Not Dana?

17:55.350 --> 17:57.214
DANA: I don't know
what's going to happen.

17:57.317 --> 17:59.216
I hope not.

17:59.319 --> 18:00.700
I don't want to make a
promise I can't keep.

18:03.668 --> 18:06.257
I didn't say that, Barbie.

18:06.361 --> 18:07.707
Say what?

18:07.810 --> 18:09.916
That I don't know what
to expect out of myself.

18:10.019 --> 18:11.435
That's not what I said.

18:11.538 --> 18:12.677
Well do you have
faith in yourself?

18:12.781 --> 18:13.540
Raise your hand.
- Yes.

18:13.644 --> 18:14.472
I don't have faith in you.

18:22.894 --> 18:24.241
WOMAN: Maybe we're
learning a new menu.

18:24.344 --> 18:25.794
WOMAN: Y'all ready?
MAN: We got this, Milly?

18:25.897 --> 18:28.452
MILLY: Yeah.

18:28.555 --> 18:30.316
Line up please, quickly.

18:30.419 --> 18:31.662
Listen carefully, all of you.

20:47.487 --> 20:48.937
I have all these
trays ready to go.

20:49.040 --> 20:51.250
You just have to season themwith salt. There's no way I

20:51.353 --> 20:54.183
can sear 60 scallops by myself.

20:54.287 --> 20:55.254
WOMAN: How long do you have?

21:00.293 --> 21:01.363
One of you bring me scallops.

21:01.467 --> 21:02.744
I need them now.

21:02.847 --> 21:04.918
We're down a person and I'mtaking on two courses tonight.

21:05.022 --> 21:06.092
And I'm feeling confident.

21:06.195 --> 21:07.611
I know that it's hard to
have a perfect service,

21:07.714 --> 21:08.715
but we're really
going to try tonight.

21:08.819 --> 21:10.061
It's for two awesome
charities and we don't

21:10.165 --> 21:11.408
want to let these people down.

21:11.511 --> 21:12.823
Ben, come here right now.

21:12.926 --> 21:15.135
Start putting garlic
chips inside the aioli.

21:15.239 --> 21:16.033
MICHELLE: Hey!

21:16.136 --> 21:17.690
I need three more scallops.

21:17.793 --> 21:20.244
Three more pieces ofscallops, down in the pan!

21:20.348 --> 21:21.728
Who fucked that up?

21:21.832 --> 21:22.626
I don't know, Chef.

21:22.729 --> 21:23.558
You don't know.

21:23.661 --> 21:24.869
Did everybody you
10 in their pan?

21:24.973 --> 21:26.146
- I had 10.
- Yes, Chef.

21:26.250 --> 21:27.251
I had 10.

21:27.355 --> 21:28.563
ELISE: Michelle, did
you forget how to count?

21:28.666 --> 21:32.601
I don't see how that happenswhen you weren't, I don't

21:32.705 --> 21:34.120
know, doing anything else.

21:34.223 --> 21:35.466
GORDON RAMSAY: How
long for the scallops?

21:35.570 --> 21:37.365
45 seconds, Chef.

21:37.468 --> 21:38.849
I need 'em as
soon as possible.

21:38.952 --> 21:40.264
Nick.

21:40.368 --> 21:41.886
So i got one plate here, thefirst plate, done peacefully.

21:41.990 --> 21:43.888

crispier and darker.

21:43.992 --> 21:45.994
Don't let these
get too dark, please.

21:46.097 --> 21:46.891
Yes, Chef.

21:46.995 --> 21:49.135
Oh my god.

21:49.238 --> 21:51.240
Is Milly trying to
sabotage me right

21:51.344 --> 21:53.001
now with overcooked scallops?

21:53.104 --> 21:54.313
Sear those scallops less.

21:54.416 --> 21:55.624
I need it cooked perfectly.

21:55.728 --> 21:56.832
No more of this shit.

21:56.936 --> 21:58.489
MILLY: I got perfect
scallops coming, Nick.

21:58.593 --> 21:59.835
GORDON RAMSAY: Come

21:59.939 --> 22:00.802

MICHELLE: Yes, Chef, I amhappy with these plates.

22:03.805 --> 22:05.116
Go, please.

22:05.220 --> 22:06.221
MICHELLE: You
know, I think we're

22:06.325 --> 22:07.740
really getting off
to a good start,

22:07.843 --> 22:09.362
minus the missing

22:20.960 --> 22:22.099

22:22.202 --> 22:22.996

NICK: Seriously, Robyn, can wefocus as a team on one course

22:29.865 --> 22:31.177

22:31.280 --> 22:32.074
One more garlic, Chef.

22:32.178 --> 22:33.248
OK.

35:40.172 --> 35:42.519
So can I explain whathappened on my course now?

35:42.623 --> 35:44.003
Oh!
Wow!

35:44.107 --> 35:44.935
BARBIE: Wait one second.

35:45.039 --> 35:46.040
ELISE: Let me tell
you why that's

35:46.144 --> 35:46.523
why all her shit was first.- It's my turn.

35:46.627 --> 35:47.697
[laughing]

35:47.800 --> 35:48.767
Let's hear this tall tale.

35:48.870 --> 35:49.664
This ought to be good.

35:49.768 --> 35:50.665
We need popcorn.

35:50.769 --> 35:52.046
Elise, let her talk.

35:52.150 --> 35:54.428
My dish had 15
things to plate on it.

35:54.531 --> 35:56.188
I think the main
issue with your dish

35:56.292 --> 35:57.879
was that the potatoeswere burnt, which it was.

35:57.983 --> 35:58.777
No.

35:58.880 --> 36:00.192
It was the distractions and--

36:00.296 --> 36:01.814
WOMAN: Who was distracted.

36:01.918 --> 36:04.023
ELISE: She's gonna try to paintlike she's better than me.

36:04.127 --> 36:05.370
But we all know that
that was the worst.

36:05.473 --> 36:06.267
WOMAN: Yeah.

36:06.371 --> 36:07.303
Hold up and wait a minute.

36:07.406 --> 36:08.718
OK.

36:08.821 --> 36:11.099
I'm voting for Barbie becauseyou needed to redeem yourself

36:11.203 --> 36:13.861
and you didn't Elise, I'mvoting for you because you would

36:13.964 --> 36:15.380
not let us help you, when--

36:15.483 --> 36:16.277
That's not true.

36:16.381 --> 36:18.348
You were very standoffish.

36:18.452 --> 36:19.246
I wasn't standoffish.

36:19.349 --> 36:20.143
You were.

36:20.247 --> 36:21.179
That's why I'm voting for you.

36:21.282 --> 36:22.870
My vote is for Barbie and you.

36:22.973 --> 36:23.974
WOMAN: Shocking.

36:24.078 --> 36:25.113
ELISE: Every time I
gave you directions,

36:25.217 --> 36:26.494
you came back with
something else to say.

36:26.598 --> 36:27.909
Barbie yelled at you
for all that stuff.

36:28.013 --> 36:29.739
And you weren't executingwhat I told you to do.

36:29.842 --> 36:31.085
And it's not the first time.

36:31.189 --> 36:32.776
It's all the time with you.

36:32.880 --> 36:35.089
You can sit there, cross yourarms and shake your head,

36:35.193 --> 36:37.022
but facts are facts.

36:37.125 --> 36:38.334
Elise and Michelle is my vote.

36:38.437 --> 36:39.507
And me?
BARBIE: Yes.

36:39.611 --> 36:40.439
Why are you voting for me?

36:40.543 --> 36:41.889
BARBIE: Michelle,
you come up with

36:41.992 --> 36:44.926
these snarky little commentsat the most inappropriate time.

36:45.030 --> 36:46.031
That's why you're
voting for me?

36:46.134 --> 36:48.136
That's the
example right there!

36:48.240 --> 36:51.036
Oh, I can work garnish for youwhen I said sure, that's great.

36:51.139 --> 36:52.831
But then when I
asked you for stuff,

36:52.934 --> 36:55.074
oh, you know what, I
just decided I quit.

36:55.178 --> 36:56.075
I did not say that.

36:56.179 --> 36:57.353
BARBIE: You said I
can't do because I

36:57.456 --> 36:58.768
have to cook the desserts now.MICHELLE: No I did not!

36:58.871 --> 37:00.114
Let her talk.

37:00.218 --> 37:01.495
I'm trying to tell you whathappened in the situation.

37:01.598 --> 37:02.427
Mmm mmm.

37:02.530 --> 37:03.669
Yes or no, Michelle?

37:03.773 --> 37:04.877
Yes or no?

37:04.981 --> 37:05.775
Did you say that or not?

37:05.878 --> 37:06.672
I did not.

37:06.776 --> 37:08.087
Oh!

37:08.191 --> 37:09.365
I did not say,
I'm not doing it.

37:09.468 --> 37:10.676
You liar!

37:10.780 --> 37:12.091
You did not come up to meand say, I can't do garnish?

37:12.195 --> 37:13.161
MICHELLE: No!

37:13.265 --> 37:14.335
She just came up to
me and said, can you

37:14.439 --> 37:15.854
have someone else do garnish?And you said, no.

37:15.957 --> 37:16.786
And I'm like, OK.

37:16.889 --> 37:17.856
What the fuck does that mean?

37:17.959 --> 37:18.753
[laughing]

37:18.857 --> 37:21.549
What does that mean?

37:21.653 --> 37:23.068
MICHELLE: No, I didn't
go up there and say,

37:23.171 --> 37:24.414
I can't do garnish.

37:24.518 --> 37:25.898
ELISE: She's like, um, Barbie,I can't do garnish for you

37:26.002 --> 37:26.796
because--

37:26.899 --> 37:27.935
I did not say that!

37:28.038 --> 37:29.281
BARBIE: Yes, you did!

37:29.385 --> 37:30.662
I just realized,
I'm supposed to be

37:30.765 --> 37:32.008
helping Dana with the dessert.

37:32.111 --> 37:34.044
Can you have Elise
do your garnish?

37:34.148 --> 37:35.322
Fuck this.

37:35.425 --> 37:39.187
ELISE: Y'all are not realwith y'all selves Period.

37:39.291 --> 37:40.154
Horseshit.

37:46.712 --> 37:48.058
So the answer to
that question was yes.

37:48.162 --> 37:49.439
WOMAN: What happened?
Who's going up.

37:49.543 --> 37:50.475
ELISE: They're full of shit!

37:50.578 --> 37:51.614
I'll tell you what happened.

37:51.717 --> 37:53.271
I cooked to perfection
for everybody's course.

37:53.374 --> 37:55.618
When it came to mine,everybody fucked my shit up.

37:55.721 --> 37:58.068
She's in there telling
lies about everything.

37:58.172 --> 37:59.967
The first tray of fish
came up, fucking first!

38:00.070 --> 38:00.864
Who cooked 'em?

38:00.968 --> 38:02.487
Jennifer.

38:02.590 --> 38:04.074
Elise knows what
she's dealing with.

38:04.178 --> 38:05.800
And to fucking play
this game right now.

38:05.904 --> 38:07.423
Pfft, please.

38:07.526 --> 38:10.495
I am from Massachusetts,
the Boston area.

38:10.598 --> 38:11.841
We don't fucking play.

38:11.944 --> 38:13.083
Yeah.

38:13.187 --> 38:14.464
JENNIFER: Don't talk aboutme like I'm not here.

38:14.568 --> 38:16.086
I'm talking about youlike you're fucking here.

38:16.190 --> 38:17.260
You ain't perfect.

38:17.364 --> 38:18.192
JENNIFER: I'm not perfect.

38:18.296 --> 38:19.193
But you know what?

38:19.297 --> 38:20.815
I grow from it and
I fucking know it.

38:20.919 --> 38:22.023
ELISE: That's why.

38:22.127 --> 38:23.439
And I cooked to perfectionfor all y'all shit.

38:23.542 --> 38:24.405
No wonder it went all--

38:24.509 --> 38:25.406
And what I say?

38:25.510 --> 38:26.752
And what did I get in return?

38:26.856 --> 38:28.029
Nothing!

38:28.133 --> 38:30.169
But that's per usual withthe red fucking team.

38:30.273 --> 38:31.067
I'm sorry.

38:31.170 --> 38:32.448
When did I fire fish?

38:32.551 --> 38:33.759
When you said to go.

38:33.863 --> 38:34.691
I'm sorry.

38:34.795 --> 38:35.623
I take that back.

38:35.727 --> 38:37.211
You mean, when
did you burn it?

38:37.315 --> 38:39.040
After Chef Ramsay told
me to fire the fish.

38:39.144 --> 38:39.938
ELISE: Bullshit.

38:40.041 --> 38:41.180
Y'all are fucking full of shit!

38:55.954 --> 38:57.576
GORDON RAMSAY: Jennifer,red team's first nomination

38:57.680 --> 38:58.508
and why, please.

38:58.612 --> 39:01.131
Our first nominee
is Barbie, Chef.

39:01.235 --> 39:02.857
The meat course
was a train wreck.

39:02.961 --> 39:04.618
The potatoes were
completely burnt.

39:04.721 --> 39:07.517
It was a cluster-fuck
in plain English.

39:07.621 --> 39:10.278
GORDON RAMSAY: The red team'ssecond nomination and why.

39:10.382 --> 39:13.523
The second nominee
is Elise, Chef.

39:13.627 --> 39:17.044
She seemed very disorganizedand frantic while we

39:17.147 --> 39:20.427
were trying to get direction.

39:20.530 --> 39:22.843
Barbie and Elise,
step forward.

39:27.641 --> 39:30.506
Barbie, your team-- have
they given up on you?

39:30.609 --> 39:32.887
Five minutes before it wastime for me to fire my course,

39:32.991 --> 39:34.889
Michelle ran over and said,hey, I can't do garnish.

39:34.993 --> 39:36.753
Then I said, no, yes you are.

39:36.857 --> 39:39.342
Yes you are going to do garnish,because I need you there.

39:39.446 --> 39:40.239
I cooked your garnish.

39:40.343 --> 39:41.620
BARBIE: Excuse me.

39:41.724 --> 39:43.519
And then I had to tell her thatshe was going to stay there

39:43.622 --> 39:45.624
and that I had to make herstop with the snippy comments.

39:45.728 --> 39:47.143
All of that stuff
is the stuff that

39:47.246 --> 39:49.179
interferes with the
red team, and keeps us

39:49.283 --> 39:50.491
from being cohesive.

39:50.595 --> 39:52.631
Holy shit.

39:52.735 --> 39:55.703
Elise, why do deserve to
stay in Hell's Kitchen?

39:55.807 --> 39:56.946
I deserve to stay
in Hell's Kitchen

39:57.049 --> 39:58.603
because I started off strong.

39:58.706 --> 40:01.019
I've had some great momentshere, and I'm not finished yet.

40:01.122 --> 40:02.607
Tonight there were a
few bumps in the road,

40:02.710 --> 40:04.574
but I didn't give up
and I bounced back.

40:04.678 --> 40:07.266
I kept repeating to me teamwhat I needed to do, like five,

40:07.370 --> 40:08.302
six times.

40:08.406 --> 40:09.752
It was a team effort.

40:09.855 --> 40:12.720
And I don't think that
they gave me 110%.

40:12.824 --> 40:16.034
GORDON RAMSAY: Ladies, I'mshocked at how fragmented

40:16.137 --> 40:17.967
you, as a team, have become.

40:18.070 --> 40:22.523
And all I get is thisfight and this bitch-fest.

40:22.627 --> 40:32.775
the person leavingHell's Kitchen is Barbie.

40:32.878 --> 40:33.672
Come here.

40:37.573 --> 40:41.128
Barbie, give me your
jacket, young lady.

40:41.231 --> 40:42.025
You've got a heart.

40:42.129 --> 40:43.061
You're determined.

40:43.164 --> 40:45.443
But you haven't
bounced back, Barbie.

40:45.546 --> 40:46.340
Good night.

40:46.444 --> 40:47.445
Good night, Chef.

40:48.446 --> 40:49.239
Thank you.

40:53.968 --> 40:56.592
BARBIE: Chef says
that I'm not ready.

40:56.695 --> 40:58.456
Am I the worst chef
in Hell's Kitchen?

40:58.559 --> 40:59.595
No.

40:59.698 --> 41:01.769
Was I the worst chef
on the red team?

41:01.873 --> 41:03.599
No.

41:03.702 --> 41:05.532
But it is what it fucking is.

41:05.635 --> 41:09.881
So now, what it is is, me,ready to go the fuck home.

41:09.984 --> 41:11.814
GORDON RAMSAY:
Elise, back in line.

41:11.917 --> 41:12.677
ELISE: Thank you, Chef.

41:15.645 --> 41:17.889
GORDON RAMSAY: Blue
team, you are on a roll.

41:17.992 --> 41:21.824
At this rate, you four
may be the final four.

41:21.927 --> 41:23.688
Red team, get it together.

41:23.791 --> 41:24.758
Yes, Chef.

41:24.861 --> 41:25.759
Now piss off.

41:25.862 --> 41:27.968
Yes, Chef.

41:28.071 --> 41:33.629
My wildest dreams have cometrue, and Barbie is gone.

41:33.732 --> 41:35.009
Farewell.

41:35.113 --> 41:37.218
The only thing that
would have been better

41:37.322 --> 41:39.600
is that Barbie and
Elise went home.

41:39.704 --> 41:42.672
But I'll take one out of two.

41:42.776 --> 41:44.916
MILLY: I'm loving what the redteam is doing to each other.

41:45.019 --> 41:46.538
All they've been
doing since day one

41:46.642 --> 41:48.160
is bringing each other down.

41:48.264 --> 41:50.093
And I really don't see
any of them staying

41:50.197 --> 41:52.406
at the helm of Hell's Kitchen.

41:52.510 --> 41:53.545
ELISE: We're at
the halfway point.

41:53.649 --> 41:54.788
There's nowhere to hide.

41:54.891 --> 41:57.584
Michelle and Dana are theweakest links on the team.

41:57.687 --> 41:59.655
I think they've been
skating through service.

41:59.758 --> 42:01.760
Hopefully the people whoaren't pulling their weight

42:01.864 --> 42:04.660
and are just coasting
by will be exposed.

42:04.763 --> 42:06.385
GORDON RAMSAY: Barbie'sperformance at charity night

42:06.489 --> 42:07.732
was a disaster.

42:07.835 --> 42:10.458
So I performed the
charity act for her team

42:10.562 --> 42:11.356
by sending her home.

42:17.949 --> 42:20.503
ANNOUNCER: Next time onHell's Kitchen All-Stars.

42:20.607 --> 42:23.748
It's a feud that began
eight seasons ago.

42:23.851 --> 42:24.749
No one else was--

42:24.852 --> 42:25.646
Shut up!

42:25.750 --> 42:27.268
It's my [bleep] turn!

42:27.372 --> 42:30.340
You know what, Elise,
sit and rotate.

42:30.444 --> 42:31.652
Oh.

42:31.756 --> 42:35.000
This is the last person onearth that I wanted to see.

42:35.104 --> 42:35.898
It's OK.

42:36.001 --> 42:37.175
You can hate me.

42:37.278 --> 42:39.108
ANNOUNCER: But with onlyeight All-Stars remaining--

42:39.211 --> 42:40.005
JENNIFER: Hey.

42:40.109 --> 42:41.110
Can you and I talk?

42:41.213 --> 42:42.421
I guess.

42:42.525 --> 42:44.838
ANNOUNCER: --Jennifer andElise do the unthinkable.

42:44.941 --> 42:47.772
We need to worktogether to get them out.

42:47.875 --> 42:49.981
Am I making a deal with
the devil right now?

42:50.084 --> 42:51.085
Absolutely.

42:51.189 --> 42:52.190
ANNOUNCER: It's all next time--

42:52.293 --> 42:53.778
We need to kick their asses.

42:53.881 --> 42:55.642
ANNOUNCER: --on a
devilish episode

42:55.745 --> 42:58.299
of "Hell's Kitchen All-Stars."
