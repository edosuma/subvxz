WEBVTT

00:08.389 --> 00:10.106
Don't do it.

00:10.134 --> 00:11.167
That one's overripe.

00:11.186 --> 00:12.887
Really? You can tell?

00:12.906 --> 00:14.373
Trust me.

00:14.407 --> 00:15.875
This is the one...

00:15.909 --> 00:17.910
Sweet and firm.

00:19.880 --> 00:21.313
I like sweet.

00:21.348 --> 00:23.248
And I like firm.

00:28.454 --> 00:29.821
What are you drinking,

00:29.856 --> 00:31.056
toxic waste?

00:31.090 --> 00:32.390
We're doing a cleanse.

00:32.424 --> 00:35.426
And he forgot his bottle,
so I came by to drop it off.

00:35.461 --> 00:37.129
He forgot it.
Are... are you sure?

00:38.330 --> 00:39.997
Actually,

00:40.031 --> 00:42.466
I've never felt better
in my entire life.

00:42.500 --> 00:45.502
Water, lime juice,
no solid food.

00:45.536 --> 00:48.005
Jenny and I are gonna start
our marriage perfectly cleansed.

00:48.039 --> 00:49.306
We've already made it a week.

00:49.340 --> 00:50.674
We only have three days to go.

00:50.708 --> 00:51.842
I can't even believe you guys

00:51.877 --> 00:53.010
are already getting married
on Sunday.

00:53.044 --> 00:54.344
I know. Isn't that crazy?

00:54.379 --> 00:56.647
I better run. My mom is
freaking out about place cards.

00:56.681 --> 00:58.181
See you there.

00:58.215 --> 00:59.683
Thanks, sweetie.
I love you.

00:59.717 --> 01:00.684
I love you more.

01:00.718 --> 01:01.785
No, that's not possible.

01:09.193 --> 01:10.494
I know.

01:10.528 --> 01:11.927
I know. I know.
We're nauseating.

01:11.961 --> 01:14.330
Well, I am looking forward

01:14.364 --> 01:16.632
to meeting some of
Jenny's sorority sisters.

01:16.667 --> 01:18.967
I'm about to show them
some of new York's finest.

01:19.002 --> 01:20.636
Good.
Then I guess you won't care

01:20.671 --> 01:22.338
that Lanie's bringing
a plus one.

01:25.975 --> 01:27.642
Who?

01:27.677 --> 01:29.811
I don't know.
She just RSVP'd plus one.

01:31.146 --> 01:32.781
How can... how can she
already have a boyfriend?

01:32.815 --> 01:34.683
We just broke up.

01:34.717 --> 01:36.184
Don't worry, Espo.
I'm going alone.

01:36.218 --> 01:37.686
So if the sorority girls
don't work out,

01:37.720 --> 01:39.153
I'll dance with ya.

01:41.624 --> 01:43.024
Esposito.

01:43.058 --> 01:45.659
Castle, Jenny tells me
that you RSVP'd plus one.

01:45.694 --> 01:47.361
You're bringing a date?

01:47.395 --> 01:48.662
I am.
Who?

01:48.697 --> 01:51.699
Well, she's beautiful,

01:51.733 --> 01:54.100
she's intelligent, she's funny,

01:54.135 --> 01:57.037
and the way she smiles at me
sometimes just melts my heart.

01:58.172 --> 01:59.405
It's Alexis.

01:59.440 --> 02:00.807
Guys.

02:00.841 --> 02:02.342
We got a fresh one.

02:04.745 --> 02:07.012
Hey, Lanie.
We got a jumper?

02:07.047 --> 02:08.514
Judging by the impact,
I'd say he came from

02:08.549 --> 02:10.782
one of those windows
above the seventh floor.

02:10.818 --> 02:12.652
Ryan and Esposito are already
into finding the room

02:12.686 --> 02:14.554
with the hotel staff.

02:14.588 --> 02:16.655
So...
He's naked.

02:16.689 --> 02:17.989
Perceptive.

02:18.023 --> 02:20.024
Well, it is pretty cold out.
If this was a suicide,

02:20.059 --> 02:21.493
wouldn't you rather be
warm and toasty

02:21.527 --> 02:24.663
on your way down to your
certain yet citrusy death?

02:24.697 --> 02:26.197
If it were a suicide,

02:26.232 --> 02:28.099
would you really have these...

02:29.569 --> 02:31.669
Fingernail marks,
only an hour old?

02:31.703 --> 02:34.338
Well, it looks like he did
the deed before taking the dive.

02:34.373 --> 02:35.506
Last item on your bucket list?

02:35.540 --> 02:36.774
Yo.

02:36.808 --> 02:39.309
Two hotel clerks saw
a white lady with long red hair

02:39.344 --> 02:42.680
hurrying out shortly after
birthday suit hit the fruit.

02:42.714 --> 02:43.848
All right, see if you can get

02:43.882 --> 02:45.015
a better description
from those clerks,

02:45.049 --> 02:46.183
and let's set up a canvass.

02:46.217 --> 02:47.584
We gotta find that woman.
Right.

02:47.618 --> 02:49.386
Antonio, can you refrigerate
these samples

02:49.420 --> 02:50.687
in the van, please?

02:50.721 --> 02:52.622
Is this the guy?

02:52.656 --> 02:54.424
Mr. plus one.

02:56.627 --> 02:59.396
Hey, Beckett!

02:59.430 --> 03:00.397
Found the room!

03:00.431 --> 03:01.765
Eighth floor!

03:01.799 --> 03:03.199
Okay!

03:10.306 --> 03:12.107
Music to set the mood by?

03:12.141 --> 03:13.609
Yeah.

03:13.643 --> 03:15.243
And then there's the lipstick
on the pillow.

03:15.278 --> 03:16.812
Looks like Lanie was right

03:16.846 --> 03:18.881
about our victim getting lucky
before he...

03:18.915 --> 03:20.448
Ran out of luck.

03:20.482 --> 03:23.083
So our vic's name
is Michael Bailey, 28,

03:23.118 --> 03:24.652
lives on West 93rd Street.

03:24.686 --> 03:26.320
And according to
his business card,

03:26.354 --> 03:28.088
he's a junior analyst
at Global 12 Consolidated

03:28.123 --> 03:29.390
in Midtown.

03:29.425 --> 03:30.558
Who booked the room?

03:30.592 --> 03:31.992
Booked under Jane Eyre.

03:32.027 --> 03:33.728
Paid with cash.
No credit card on file.

03:33.762 --> 03:35.396
Suggests premeditation.

03:35.430 --> 03:36.897
She knew
she was gonna kill him,

03:36.931 --> 03:38.398
so she booked
the room anonymously.

03:38.433 --> 03:39.900
Yeah, but then
why sleep with him?

03:39.934 --> 03:41.401
Why not just push him
out the window?

03:41.436 --> 03:43.770
Because she's a black widow...

03:45.473 --> 03:47.073
The coldest-hearted creature
on Earth.

03:47.107 --> 03:48.608
She lures an unsuspecting male,

03:48.643 --> 03:50.477
takes him into her web,

03:50.511 --> 03:52.077
and then the moment
they culminate,

03:52.111 --> 03:53.612
as soon as he feels the ecstasy

03:53.647 --> 03:57.015
of achieving
his biological destiny,

03:57.050 --> 04:00.218
she opens up her jaws
and eats him alive.

04:01.555 --> 04:03.188
I'm glad I'm in
a healthy relationship.

04:03.222 --> 04:04.657
Yeah.

04:04.691 --> 04:06.325
I bet male black widow spiders

04:06.359 --> 04:08.292
think they're in
healthy relationships, too.

04:08.327 --> 04:11.529
Well, black widow or not,

04:11.564 --> 04:13.030
I think...

04:13.065 --> 04:15.032
I figured out
how we can find her.

04:15.067 --> 04:16.200
Bingo.

04:17.470 --> 04:18.970
Do you have any idea who I am?

04:19.004 --> 04:22.239
I'm a founding partner
of Keller, Braun and Franklin.

04:22.274 --> 04:23.674
I'm Franklin.

04:23.708 --> 04:25.408
Okay. Well, I don't care
about your law firm.

04:25.443 --> 04:27.344
A man fell
to his death tonight,

04:27.378 --> 04:29.312
and fingerprints confirm

04:29.347 --> 04:30.681
that you were
at the crime scene.

04:30.715 --> 04:32.483
No, I had nothing to do
with it.

04:32.517 --> 04:33.784
Okay, maybe you can tell me
why people saw you

04:33.818 --> 04:34.985
fleeing the crime scene.

04:36.420 --> 04:38.388
Ms. Franklin,

04:38.422 --> 04:40.790
evidence suggests
that you and Michael...

04:40.824 --> 04:42.992
Michael?
Bailey were romantically involved.

04:43.026 --> 04:44.326
Michael who?

04:44.361 --> 04:45.795
This man.

04:47.330 --> 04:48.798
No, that's not Michael.

04:48.832 --> 04:50.867
That's Jake.
That's Jake Hendricks.

04:50.901 --> 04:52.234
No, that's Michael Bailey.

04:52.268 --> 04:54.504
I think I would know
who I was sleeping with.

04:54.538 --> 04:56.104
Well, apparently, you don't.

04:57.673 --> 04:58.624
You think I should pull
her phone records?

04:58.625 --> 04:59.574
Okay, look...

04:59.609 --> 05:00.842
Nah, what's the point?
I don't know anything about a fake name.

05:00.877 --> 05:02.777
We already have her
at the hotel with our victim.

05:02.812 --> 05:04.546
Not her.

05:04.580 --> 05:05.847
Lanie.

05:05.882 --> 05:07.181
What?

05:07.216 --> 05:08.650
I'm not gonna go
to your wedding

05:08.684 --> 05:10.552
without knowing
who this guy is.

05:10.586 --> 05:13.053
Jenny has to find out
for the place cards.

05:13.087 --> 05:15.022
I'll get you his name.

05:15.056 --> 05:16.189
Okay.

05:16.224 --> 05:17.391
Yes, he told me

05:17.425 --> 05:18.926
his name was Jake.

05:18.960 --> 05:21.829
He said that he
flies in from Chicago

05:21.863 --> 05:25.198
to make sales calls
for his family business?

05:25.233 --> 05:27.434
He was really sweet.

05:27.468 --> 05:29.302
I didn't kill him.

05:29.337 --> 05:31.405
I was
falling in love with him.

05:31.439 --> 05:33.340
Well, he fell pretty hard, too.

05:33.374 --> 05:35.008
So how long were
the two of you dating?

05:36.544 --> 05:39.846
Well, we, uh,
we actually just met tonight.

05:39.880 --> 05:43.783
At Wilmer's bar
at around 7:00.

05:43.817 --> 05:45.117
Tonight?

05:45.152 --> 05:47.719
And you were already
falling in love with him?

05:47.754 --> 05:49.721
Look, I-I know...
I know it sounds crazy,

05:49.756 --> 05:53.459
but it felt like one of
those magical connections

05:53.493 --> 05:55.261
that you read about, you know?

05:55.295 --> 05:57.763
After we...

05:57.797 --> 05:59.231
You know,

05:59.266 --> 06:01.899
he started to get dizzy

06:01.934 --> 06:03.734
and...  Sweaty.

06:03.769 --> 06:06.637
So he opened up a window
to get some fresh air,

06:06.672 --> 06:09.474
and he was leaning against
the windowsill

06:09.508 --> 06:11.109
when suddenly...

06:12.478 --> 06:14.912
He just...

06:19.684 --> 06:21.952
Okay.
So you're saying that...

06:23.421 --> 06:24.888
He fell out the window

06:24.922 --> 06:27.491
and your first instinct
wasn't to call 9-1-1,

06:27.525 --> 06:29.159
but to run away?

06:29.194 --> 06:31.328
I knew how it would look,
but I panicked

06:31.362 --> 06:32.996
and I made
a really bad decision.

06:33.030 --> 06:35.765
But I swear,
it was an accident.

06:35.800 --> 06:37.767
It was not an accident.

06:37.802 --> 06:39.268
You can tell he was pushed?

06:39.303 --> 06:40.436
I didn't say he was pushed.

06:40.471 --> 06:41.771
Michael Bailey was poisoned

06:41.806 --> 06:44.140
with a lethal dose
of colchicine.

06:44.174 --> 06:45.575
He was dead
before he hit the fruit.

06:45.610 --> 06:46.643
Colchicine?

06:46.711 --> 06:48.144
Isn't that a drug
for rheumatism?

06:48.178 --> 06:50.345
Yes, which Bailey
does not have,

06:50.379 --> 06:52.514
but he had 50 times the normal
dosage in his system.

06:52.548 --> 06:54.349
I'm putting
the time of ingestion

06:54.383 --> 06:56.151
between
4:00 and 6:00 P.M.

06:56.185 --> 06:57.786
Which is 45 minutes before

06:57.821 --> 06:59.588
Holly said she met him
at Wilmer's bar.

06:59.623 --> 07:01.991
Any idea how that drug
was delivered?

07:02.025 --> 07:03.325
It was in something he drank.

07:03.359 --> 07:05.960
I found lots of whey-protein
isolate in his stomach,

07:05.995 --> 07:07.361
along with chocolate.

07:07.395 --> 07:08.863
So a chocolate protein shake.

07:08.897 --> 07:11.099
It'd be sweet enough to mask
the taste of the drug.

07:11.133 --> 07:13.434
Speaking of sweet, who's
your date for Ryan's wedding?

07:14.737 --> 07:16.303
Took a shot.

07:16.338 --> 07:17.505
All right. Thanks, Lanie.

07:17.539 --> 07:18.673
One more thing.

07:18.707 --> 07:20.207
I ran a D.N.A. Test
just to confirm

07:20.242 --> 07:22.142
that superman here
had sex before dying...

07:22.176 --> 07:24.111
No, it's okay.
Our suspect... let me finish.

07:24.145 --> 07:26.246
The test shows
he had sex all right,

07:26.280 --> 07:28.849
with two different women

07:28.883 --> 07:31.351
within hours of his death.

07:31.385 --> 07:34.955
You dog.

07:34.989 --> 07:36.623
Ms. Franklin, I...

07:36.657 --> 07:40.192
It seems that you weren't
the only woman that...

07:40.226 --> 07:42.728
That Mr. Bailey was, uh...

07:42.763 --> 07:45.329
With in the hours
prior to his death.

07:45.364 --> 07:48.499
What do you mean, with?

07:48.534 --> 07:51.870
Was there another woman
in the hotel room with you?

07:51.904 --> 07:54.572
I didn't think this could get
any more humiliating.

07:54.606 --> 07:55.740
Was that a yes?

07:55.775 --> 07:56.841
No, detective.

07:56.876 --> 07:58.176
Thank you.

07:58.210 --> 08:00.311
And you should know
that our M.E.

08:00.345 --> 08:02.012
Has been able to determine
that Mr. Bailey

08:02.047 --> 08:03.814
was, uh... wearing a condom

08:03.848 --> 08:05.415
both times

08:05.449 --> 08:06.516
so that's...

08:06.551 --> 08:10.154
That makes it all better.

08:11.723 --> 08:14.257
Now I wish I pushed him!

08:14.292 --> 08:15.759
Hell hath no fury, all right.

08:15.794 --> 08:17.259
But I'm pretty sure
she's telling the truth.

08:17.294 --> 08:19.261
Yeah, maybe, but let's
just confirm her alibi

08:19.296 --> 08:20.596
before releasing her.

08:20.630 --> 08:22.098
In the meantime,
we need to figure out

08:22.132 --> 08:23.632
where Bailey was
and who he was with

08:23.667 --> 08:25.601
between 4:00 and 6:00 P.M.
When he was poisoned.

08:25.635 --> 08:26.769
Exactly.

08:26.804 --> 08:28.404
That is our kill zone.

08:28.438 --> 08:30.406
Hey.

08:30.440 --> 08:31.908
So I can't find
any next of kin on the guy.

08:31.942 --> 08:33.174
Parents died years ago.

08:33.208 --> 08:37.111
There's no siblings,
no nothing.

08:40.249 --> 08:41.282
You okay?

08:41.317 --> 08:42.450
Fine.

08:42.484 --> 08:43.784
So then everything Bailey

08:43.820 --> 08:46.054
told Holly about himself
was a lie.

08:46.089 --> 08:47.789
Mm. Maybe that was
his trick.

08:47.824 --> 08:49.523
In from out of time,
family guy, own business...

08:49.557 --> 08:51.291
That's how he got women in bed.

08:51.326 --> 08:52.893
Whatever his reason
for lying to Holly,

08:52.928 --> 08:54.895
I'm betting that our killer
is whoever Bailey slept with

08:54.930 --> 08:56.396
earlier in the day.

08:56.431 --> 08:58.232
She got on to his philandering
and got even.

08:58.266 --> 09:00.067
All right. Go through his
phone records.

09:00.102 --> 09:01.568
We gotta find that other woman.

09:06.774 --> 09:07.841
Good morning, dad.

09:07.875 --> 09:09.109
Good morning.

09:09.143 --> 09:11.377
Darling, where's your credit card?

09:11.411 --> 09:13.179
Mm.
Liked "good morning" better.

09:14.215 --> 09:15.615
Let me ask you two something.
Mm.

09:15.649 --> 09:19.052
If you found out a man
was cheating on you,

09:19.086 --> 09:20.886
how would you kill him?

09:20.920 --> 09:22.921
Knife... to the heart.

09:22.956 --> 09:24.790
All right. What if you don't
have the stomach for that?

09:24.824 --> 09:26.892
Shoot him. But you don't have
the stomach for that either.

09:26.926 --> 09:28.927
What's wrong with our stomachs?
There's always poison.

09:28.962 --> 09:31.163
True. Watch him writhe
and suffer.

09:31.197 --> 09:32.898
Die like the rodent he is.

09:34.100 --> 09:35.901
All these years
writing about murderers,

09:35.935 --> 09:38.402
I had no idea I was living among them.
Well...

09:38.436 --> 09:41.239
Speaking of murder,
what's the credit card for?

09:41.273 --> 09:42.940
We're going shopping
to pick out my dress

09:42.975 --> 09:44.776
to be your date
at Ryan's wedding.

09:44.810 --> 09:46.310
What's wrong
with the ones you have?

09:46.344 --> 09:47.478
Darling,

09:47.512 --> 09:50.148
beauty does not happen
by accident.

09:50.182 --> 09:52.849
And that's why, when it goes
unappreciated by cheating scum,

09:52.884 --> 09:54.550
we want revenge.

09:59.023 --> 10:01.391
Even their hypothetical fury
is unnerving.

10:01.425 --> 10:02.926
William congreve had it right

10:02.960 --> 10:04.394
when he talked about
scorned women.

10:04.428 --> 10:06.062
Yeah, well, you haven't heard
what I would do.

10:06.097 --> 10:07.563
Yeah, I don't think
I ever want to know.

10:07.598 --> 10:08.898
Hey, guys.

10:08.932 --> 10:11.466
 Any luck tracking
down Bailey's other woman?

10:11.501 --> 10:12.634
A lot of luck.

10:19.309 --> 10:21.343
It's like
the beginning of "the bachelor,"

10:21.377 --> 10:23.045
but without the appletinis.

10:23.079 --> 10:25.713
Bailey was
involved with all of them?

10:25.747 --> 10:27.515
Yeah.

10:27.549 --> 10:30.484
And each of them thought that
they were his one and only.

10:31.720 --> 10:34.588
That's a lot
of scorned women...

10:34.623 --> 10:36.624
And a lot of fury.

10:38.000 --> 10:44.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

10:46.875 --> 10:48.624
Yeah. Yeah, I don't get it.

10:48.677 --> 10:50.913
H-how does
an average looking guy

10:50.945 --> 10:52.378
with a dime-a-dozen analyst job

10:52.413 --> 10:54.413
end up dating
all of these gorgeous women?

10:54.447 --> 10:55.581
By lying to them.

10:55.615 --> 10:57.783
Actually, he wasn't lying
to these women.

10:57.817 --> 10:59.251
At least not about
who he was anyway.

10:59.286 --> 11:00.719
They all knew him
by his real name.

11:00.753 --> 11:03.389
Then why would he tell Holly
that he's Jake from Chicago?

11:03.423 --> 11:04.723
Was Bailey with
any of those women

11:04.757 --> 11:06.225
between 4:00 and 6:00
yesterday?

11:06.259 --> 11:07.560
So far, no.

11:07.594 --> 11:09.394
But they all deny knowing
that he was even in the city.

11:09.428 --> 11:10.961
A month ago,
he told every one of 'em

11:10.996 --> 11:12.497
he was going to Europe
for six weeks.

11:12.531 --> 11:13.698
A month ago?

11:13.732 --> 11:15.266
So why'd he come back early?

11:15.301 --> 11:16.501
He never went.

11:16.535 --> 11:18.002
And as far as I can tell
from his credit card use,

11:18.036 --> 11:19.837
he never even left new York.

11:19.871 --> 11:21.339
So why tell them
that he was leaving?

11:21.373 --> 11:24.075
I mean, was that just a cowardly
way of breaking up with them?

11:24.109 --> 11:25.943
I think there's
something else going on.

11:25.977 --> 11:27.111
I called
the personnel department

11:27.145 --> 11:28.445
at Global 12 Consolidated.

11:28.479 --> 11:29.613
And they said that he's been
on a leave of absence

11:29.647 --> 11:30.614
for the last month.

11:30.648 --> 11:32.349
That's a big month...

11:32.383 --> 11:34.752
Taking a leave from work
and your girlfriends.

11:34.786 --> 11:37.387
And his apartment.

11:37.422 --> 11:39.456
The doorman at Bailey's building
said that for the past month,

11:39.490 --> 11:41.791
he's only spent
a couple nights a week there.

11:41.826 --> 11:42.959
Past month.

11:42.993 --> 11:44.160
Yeah.

11:44.195 --> 11:45.328
He wasn't there
at all yesterday,

11:45.362 --> 11:46.796
so that's not
where he was poisoned.

11:46.831 --> 11:49.365
And I looked in his dresser

11:49.399 --> 11:51.201
and I found this.

11:51.235 --> 11:53.369
Illinois driver's license.

11:53.403 --> 11:54.604
Jake Hendricks, Chicago.

11:54.638 --> 11:56.472
That's the name
that he gave Holly.

11:56.506 --> 11:58.140
So he is Jake Hendricks?

11:58.174 --> 12:00.475
No, he's Mike Bailey.
That's a fake.

12:00.509 --> 12:01.977
He did not buy this
on some street corner.

12:02.011 --> 12:03.345
This is government grade.

12:03.379 --> 12:05.647
Yeah, right down to
the security hologram.

12:05.681 --> 12:07.315
It's like he was
living undercover.

12:07.350 --> 12:08.650
And I found this.

12:08.684 --> 12:10.018
That's a lot of cake.

12:10.053 --> 12:11.754
Why do you have to
call it cake? It's money.

12:11.788 --> 12:13.654
It's a lot of money.
It's about 60 grand.

12:13.688 --> 12:15.356
Cash, fake I.D...

12:15.390 --> 12:17.191
What the hell was Bailey into?

12:17.226 --> 12:19.660
Something bigger than
lying about who he was

12:19.694 --> 12:20.995
just to get laid.

12:21.029 --> 12:24.832
Jake Hendricks
has fake web search hits.

12:24.867 --> 12:26.667
Lives in Chicago,
works for the family business.

12:26.701 --> 12:28.002
Just like he told
Holly Franklin.

12:29.270 --> 12:31.071
Family business
has a fake web site.

12:31.105 --> 12:32.873
That's a pretty deep cover.

12:32.907 --> 12:35.508
Yeah. Our don Juan's starting
to look more like Jason bourne.

12:35.542 --> 12:37.377
All right, you guys get ahold
of FBI and CIA

12:37.411 --> 12:39.045
and any other
intelligence agency,

12:39.080 --> 12:40.413
see if he's one of theirs.

12:40.447 --> 12:42.182
Come on, Castle.
Let's talk to Bailey's boss

12:42.216 --> 12:43.683
at Global 12 Consolidated,

12:43.717 --> 12:47.552
find out why our vic took
that leave of absence.

12:47.587 --> 12:49.655
We still need the estimates
on thorium in India.

12:49.689 --> 12:50.823
And I would appreciate...

12:50.857 --> 12:52.258
Excuse me, Mr. Harris.

12:52.776 --> 12:54.510
Those detectives
are here for you.

12:57.530 --> 12:58.897
You guys mind
if we take a few minutes?

12:58.931 --> 13:00.165
No problem.

13:00.200 --> 13:01.499
We're still working up
the financing terms

13:01.533 --> 13:02.866
on subordinated debt anyway.

13:02.901 --> 13:04.435
Sure.

13:04.470 --> 13:07.505
It's not like these negotiations
are going anywhere.

13:07.539 --> 13:10.475
Mike was a junior analyst
in our acquisition department.

13:10.509 --> 13:13.478
He was a good kid,
bright future.

13:13.512 --> 13:16.314
I understand that he took
a leave of absence a month ago.

13:16.348 --> 13:18.047
Did he give you a reason why?

13:18.082 --> 13:19.516
Personal issues.

13:19.550 --> 13:22.486
He didn't say why, but I
could tell it was serious.

13:22.520 --> 13:23.753
So you have no idea why

13:23.787 --> 13:26.823
he would have a fake I.D.
And $60,000 cash?

13:26.857 --> 13:29.292
No.

13:29.327 --> 13:31.228
But maybe it had something
to do with that woman

13:31.262 --> 13:33.329
that tried to break in
his office yesterday.

13:33.363 --> 13:34.997
Who was that?
I don't know.

13:35.031 --> 13:36.232
She was gone
before security got there.

13:36.266 --> 13:37.600
And who reported it?

13:37.634 --> 13:38.934
I had stepped out
of negotiations

13:38.968 --> 13:40.536
to go to the restroom.

13:40.570 --> 13:43.205
And in the hallway,
I noticed a woman was trying

13:43.240 --> 13:44.540
to pick an office door lock

13:44.574 --> 13:46.742
using a wrench
and an opened-up paper clip.

13:46.776 --> 13:49.544
I assumed she had just locked
herself out of her office

13:49.578 --> 13:51.712
and joked that a key
would work better.

13:51.747 --> 13:53.080
Well, she was startled

13:53.115 --> 13:56.317
and shoved me over and made
a dash for the stairwell.

13:56.352 --> 13:57.452
Did you get a good look at her?

13:57.486 --> 13:59.454
Yeah, and I told security.

13:59.488 --> 14:02.524
She was exotic, 30-ish,
dark, wavy hair.

14:02.558 --> 14:04.759
She had on an overcoat,
but it was open,

14:04.793 --> 14:07.060
and she was wearing a pin
with the star of David on it.

14:07.094 --> 14:09.363
I'm pretty sure
it's the insignia

14:09.397 --> 14:11.031
from El Al airlines.

14:12.233 --> 14:13.933
Name's Colette roth.

14:13.968 --> 14:15.269
She's 27.

14:15.303 --> 14:16.736
She's been an El Al flight
attendant for three years,

14:16.771 --> 14:19.206
making the Tel Aviv-J. F.K. run
twice a week.

14:19.240 --> 14:21.207
Intel agencies used to use
flight attendants as spies,

14:21.241 --> 14:22.542
didn't they?

14:22.576 --> 14:24.644
Yeah, and get this,
she's former Israeli military.

14:24.678 --> 14:26.546
Mossad is
famous for poisoning.

14:26.580 --> 14:28.080
Yeah, big-time. Castle may not
be that far off...

14:28.114 --> 14:30.449
With his Jason bourne theory.

14:30.484 --> 14:32.151
Uniforms are tracking her down now.

14:32.186 --> 14:34.453
Jenny just texted me
Lanie's plus one.

14:34.488 --> 14:36.121
Name is Toby Lang.

14:36.156 --> 14:37.722
Wh...

14:37.756 --> 14:39.157
What? Toby.
All right.

14:40.660 --> 14:43.295
Let's check this punk out.

14:45.030 --> 14:47.131
Dr. Toby Lang?

14:47.166 --> 14:48.500
The guy's the
chief administrator

14:48.534 --> 14:50.268
at St. Samuel's hospital.

14:50.303 --> 14:51.603
Big job.

14:51.637 --> 14:53.937
Lanie did her residency
there, didn't she?

14:53.971 --> 14:54.971
Yeah.

14:55.006 --> 14:56.840
Good-looking guy.

14:56.874 --> 14:58.942
Played college hoops
at Kentucky?

14:58.976 --> 15:00.244
Groundbreaking
cancer researcher?

15:00.278 --> 15:01.478
Are you kidding me?

15:01.513 --> 15:02.779
Put me down for plus one.

15:02.814 --> 15:04.682
Jenny already did the tables.

15:04.716 --> 15:07.784
What about
her sorority sisters?

15:07.819 --> 15:09.586
Dude, I'm not showing up solo

15:09.620 --> 15:11.787
when she's bringing
captain America over here.

15:11.822 --> 15:13.590
Okay, I'll talk to Jenny,

15:13.624 --> 15:16.326
but her mom is gonna need a name for
that place card.

15:16.360 --> 15:19.595
Esposito.

15:19.629 --> 15:20.896
Copy that.

15:22.199 --> 15:24.700
Colette roth just checked in
for a flight at J.F.K.

15:24.735 --> 15:26.235
Unis are picking her up now.

15:26.269 --> 15:27.369
All right.

15:27.403 --> 15:28.938
I'm not a spy.

15:28.972 --> 15:30.973
I'm a flight attendant.

15:31.007 --> 15:32.507
Well, then maybe you could
explain your relationship

15:32.542 --> 15:34.008
with Michael Bailey.

15:34.043 --> 15:36.111
We were soul mates.

15:36.145 --> 15:38.479
Well, then I'm sure
you'll be able to tell us

15:38.513 --> 15:40.181
where the two of you
were yesterday

15:40.216 --> 15:42.316
between the hours
of 4:00 and 6:00 P.M.

15:42.351 --> 15:44.485
I was outside his apartment
waiting for him.

15:44.519 --> 15:45.686
But he never came.

15:45.721 --> 15:48.022
You had a very busy day
yesterday.

15:48.057 --> 15:50.891
You were seen trying
to break in to his office

15:50.925 --> 15:53.127
just hours before that.

15:53.161 --> 15:56.363
I was hoping to find
some kind of clue,

15:56.397 --> 15:58.698
something that might lead me
to his enemies.

15:58.733 --> 15:59.867
His enemies?

15:59.901 --> 16:01.802
Michael was a hunted man.

16:01.836 --> 16:03.904
Hunted, by who?

16:03.938 --> 16:05.239
I don't know.

16:05.273 --> 16:07.140
I just know he was in trouble.

16:07.174 --> 16:10.009
Four weeks ago, he said
he was going to Europe.

16:10.043 --> 16:12.211
But I kept seeing him
in the city,

16:12.246 --> 16:14.247
and he kept pretending
not to notice me.

16:14.282 --> 16:15.882
So I staked out his apartment.

16:15.916 --> 16:17.150
So you stalked him?

16:17.184 --> 16:18.652
Staked, stalked...
What's the difference?

16:18.686 --> 16:20.654
I was looking out for him!

16:20.688 --> 16:22.721
But he wasn't coming home.

16:22.756 --> 16:25.123
Then a few days ago,
I finally confronted him.

16:25.158 --> 16:26.625
He said he couldn't talk,

16:26.660 --> 16:28.661
but he told me
to meet him the next day

16:28.695 --> 16:30.429
and he'd explain everything.

16:30.463 --> 16:31.563
Let me guess.

16:31.598 --> 16:33.399
That was the last time
you saw him.

16:33.433 --> 16:35.267
No. We met the next day.

16:35.302 --> 16:37.269
But before he could tell me
what was going on,

16:37.303 --> 16:40.938
this car came out of nowhere,
and they were on us.

16:40.972 --> 16:42.106
Who?

16:42.140 --> 16:43.608
Ruffians in ski masks.

16:43.642 --> 16:45.943
They grabbed him
and threw him in the back.

16:45.977 --> 16:48.012
I fought
with all of my strength,

16:48.046 --> 16:49.347
but it was in vain.

16:49.381 --> 16:51.349
Bet you did.

16:51.383 --> 16:52.684
Did you report this?

16:52.718 --> 16:54.418
No.

16:54.452 --> 16:56.420
They said they'd kill him
if I did.

16:56.454 --> 16:58.555
That's why I was trying
to find him the next day,

16:58.589 --> 17:01.191
to see if they'd let him go.

17:01.225 --> 17:02.826
But they killed him.

17:02.860 --> 17:05.228
The ruffians killed him.

17:05.262 --> 17:08.263
And where
did this all happen?

17:08.299 --> 17:10.232
On the street for all to see.

17:10.266 --> 17:12.367
Okay.

17:12.402 --> 17:13.636
Corner of Washington and Greenwich,

17:13.670 --> 17:15.237
A.T.M. Cam.

17:15.271 --> 17:17.740
This is where Colette said the
abduction went down.

17:17.773 --> 17:19.541
But I've
been over it, and there's nothing.

17:19.576 --> 17:21.777
All right.
Unless you guys are enjoying

17:21.811 --> 17:23.479
the Warhol-Esque quality
of this,

17:23.512 --> 17:25.079
we can just shut it down.

17:25.114 --> 17:26.714
I'm gonna go and check on
Esposito, see where he's at

17:26.749 --> 17:28.082
with Colette's alibi.

17:28.116 --> 17:29.384
Wait.

17:29.418 --> 17:30.485
There's Bailey.

17:32.154 --> 17:34.789
And here comes Colette.

17:34.824 --> 17:36.624
Seriously?

17:37.965 --> 17:39.750
Whoa.

17:42.330 --> 17:44.631
Ruffians in ski masks.

17:44.666 --> 17:47.067
You gotta be kidding me.

17:49.003 --> 17:52.506
Looks like Colette just broke
that ruffian's nose.

17:52.540 --> 17:54.307
Fake I.D.,

17:54.342 --> 17:56.643
bricks of cash,

17:56.678 --> 17:59.445
brazen abduction...

17:59.480 --> 18:01.447
He really was
Jason Bourne.

18:01.482 --> 18:03.048
You gotta be kidding me.

18:05.901 --> 18:07.388
Can't you see it?

18:07.472 --> 18:09.665
Bailey is in covert ops.

18:09.699 --> 18:11.600
They placed him at a giant
multinational company,

18:11.634 --> 18:13.368
Global 12 Consolidated,
as a cover.

18:13.403 --> 18:16.270
Then a month ago,
they activate him.

18:16.305 --> 18:19.039
They give him an alias,
you know, a backstory.

18:19.074 --> 18:21.041
They give him
unlimited walking-around money,

18:21.076 --> 18:23.143
and then somehow

18:23.178 --> 18:24.812
the enemy gets to him.

18:24.846 --> 18:26.547
They grab him off the streets.

18:26.582 --> 18:28.082
He manages to escape,

18:28.116 --> 18:30.817
so they exploit
his Achilles' heel...

18:30.851 --> 18:32.452
His love of beautiful women.

18:32.486 --> 18:36.122
They send in
a super sexy secret agent.

18:36.156 --> 18:38.124
She seduces him,

18:38.158 --> 18:41.524
and then kills him by feeding
him a poisoned protein shake.

18:43.438 --> 18:45.232
I can't think
of anything better.

18:47.601 --> 18:49.235
Beckett.

18:50.537 --> 18:51.837
Really?

18:51.871 --> 18:54.440
Okay. Thank you.

18:55.642 --> 18:56.975
The CIA, the FBI,

18:57.009 --> 18:59.144
and the D.H.S. Have never
heard of Bailey

18:59.178 --> 19:00.512
or his alias.

19:00.547 --> 19:02.281
Do you really think
they'd tell you if they did?

19:03.950 --> 19:06.151
Tech just got the plate number
off the kidnappers' car.

19:06.185 --> 19:07.352
I thought that the plates
weren't visible

19:07.386 --> 19:08.620
on the A.T.M. Footage.

19:08.654 --> 19:10.088
They weren't, but I found

19:10.123 --> 19:12.090
a traffic cam up the block
where they were.

19:12.125 --> 19:13.091
Car is registered
to a Pablo Barnes,

19:13.126 --> 19:14.425
28, insurance salesman.

19:14.460 --> 19:15.693
That's probably a cover, too.

19:15.728 --> 19:17.195
Did you get an address?

19:17.230 --> 19:18.363
Sure did.

19:18.397 --> 19:21.165
All right. Let's go.
Where's Espo?

19:21.199 --> 19:23.267
In the break room
trying to score his plus one.

19:23.301 --> 19:24.969
Espo, let's go.

19:28.506 --> 19:30.274
Sorry. I gotta...

19:30.308 --> 19:31.675
I gotta go.

19:33.912 --> 19:35.879
I was this close
to getting my plus one.

19:35.913 --> 19:37.881
Hey, relax, man.
It happens to a lot of guys.

19:37.915 --> 19:41.184
You get a little excited,
lose control of your steamer.

19:44.021 --> 19:46.156
NYPD! Let me see
your hands right now!

19:46.190 --> 19:48.158
NYPD!

19:48.192 --> 19:49.793
- Don't move!
- Hey, police!

19:49.827 --> 19:51.160
What the hell, Pablo?!
Please don't shoot.

19:51.194 --> 19:52.327
Pablo Barnes?

19:52.361 --> 19:54.029
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Please don't shoot.

19:54.063 --> 19:55.563
I don't know what you're doing
here, but we didn't do anything.

19:55.598 --> 19:56.899
Broken nose.
Other masked man.

19:56.933 --> 19:58.834
Espo, get him, too.

19:58.868 --> 20:01.136
Turn around!

20:01.171 --> 20:02.637
All right, seriously,
I don't know why...

20:02.672 --> 20:03.972
You... you guys have
the wrong pe... ah.

20:04.007 --> 20:05.307
Officer, I-I... do
they have to be that tight?

20:05.341 --> 20:06.474
It's very... ow.

20:07.676 --> 20:09.743
Hey. "Bolero."

20:11.546 --> 20:13.314
Just like in the hotel.

20:13.348 --> 20:16.050
- See.
- I told you we were badass.

20:19.955 --> 20:21.755
That's your car, Pablo.

20:21.790 --> 20:23.256
What were you and Bailey up to,

20:23.291 --> 20:25.258
and why...
Did you kill him?

20:25.293 --> 20:27.360
Wait. Are... are you telling me
Mike's dead?

20:27.394 --> 20:28.594
Cut the act, Pablo.

20:28.629 --> 20:30.430
We know you kidnapped him
two days ago. Why?

20:30.464 --> 20:31.764
No, no, no. I-it's not
what it looks like.

20:31.799 --> 20:33.366
It's an ex-stalk-tion.

20:33.400 --> 20:35.368
Ex-stalk-a-what?

20:35.402 --> 20:36.536
Mike's our buddy.

20:36.603 --> 20:38.705
He got involved with
this crazy stalker chick...

20:38.739 --> 20:40.072
Colette something...

20:40.106 --> 20:42.308
So we staged an abduction
to scare her off.

20:42.342 --> 20:44.076
We call it an ex-stalk-tion.

20:44.110 --> 20:45.444
Are you saying,
Bailey was in on it?

20:45.478 --> 20:47.913
Yeah.
The three of us are a crew.

20:47.948 --> 20:49.014
What kind of crew?

20:49.049 --> 20:50.216
Special forces?

20:50.250 --> 20:51.717
Private military contractors?

20:51.751 --> 20:53.585
We're pickup artists.

20:53.619 --> 20:55.954
As in...
Picking up women?

20:55.988 --> 20:57.588
You?

20:57.622 --> 20:59.457
We dedicate our lives

20:59.491 --> 21:01.960
to picking up
as many hot women as possible.

21:01.994 --> 21:03.694
That would explain
all of Bailey's women.

21:03.729 --> 21:05.864
And those girls at the apartment
were pretty hot.

21:05.898 --> 21:07.866
Pfft. Yeah.

21:07.900 --> 21:09.767
That music that was playing,

21:09.801 --> 21:11.902
is that part of
your seduction strategy?

21:11.936 --> 21:13.403
Yeah.

21:13.437 --> 21:16.439
"Bolero" increases the chance
of closing the deal by 12%.

21:16.474 --> 21:17.908
Okay, assuming that you
are telling the truth,

21:17.942 --> 21:19.409
you were with Mike
the night before he was killed.

21:19.443 --> 21:20.744
Did he tell you
what he was up to?

21:20.778 --> 21:22.479
Nah. He was being
all secretive.

21:22.513 --> 21:25.215
I mean, he stopped hanging out
with us, like, a month ago.

21:25.250 --> 21:27.049
Really, a month?

21:27.084 --> 21:28.650
Yeah, when he called
about the ex-stalk-tion

21:28.685 --> 21:30.086
a couple of days ago,

21:30.120 --> 21:31.754
that was the first time we've
heard from him since then.

21:31.788 --> 21:33.722
So when he said he was going out
after the ex-stalk-tion,

21:33.757 --> 21:35.357
naturally, we followed him.

21:35.391 --> 21:36.758
Where'd he go?

21:36.792 --> 21:38.659
He went to this totally
lame bar... the magic bottle.

21:38.694 --> 21:41.329
I mean, not target-rich
at all.

21:41.364 --> 21:42.964
And when he found us there,

21:42.999 --> 21:44.900
he kinda freaked, but he agreed

21:44.934 --> 21:46.734
to let us stay
and be his wingmen,

21:46.769 --> 21:49.570
but only if we
referred to him as Jake,

21:49.605 --> 21:51.338
like he was undercover.

21:51.373 --> 21:53.307
Jake. That's the same identity
he gave to Holly Franklin

21:53.341 --> 21:54.474
the next day.

21:54.509 --> 21:56.843
So we do our usual
couple laps of recon.

21:56.878 --> 21:58.979
Actually,
some pretty decent milfs.

21:59.014 --> 22:00.915
And I think Mike's just
expanding his palate, right?

22:00.949 --> 22:04.084
But he wasn't interested
in any of them.

22:04.119 --> 22:06.420
No. Instead, he finds
this one mark,

22:06.454 --> 22:07.921
like, ugh, nothing special,

22:07.955 --> 22:09.856
and plants his flag.

22:09.891 --> 22:11.858
Then I see that she's got
a ring on her finger.

22:11.893 --> 22:13.727
She's a married chick.

22:13.761 --> 22:15.962
We stay away
from married chicks.

22:15.996 --> 22:17.764
'Cause you're so ethical.

22:17.799 --> 22:19.098
- No.
- They're just trouble.

22:19.133 --> 22:20.600
But he doesn't care.

22:20.635 --> 22:22.468
He's all in on her.

22:22.502 --> 22:24.870
So you think he went to this bar
for this particular woman,

22:24.905 --> 22:26.038
like he was targeting her?

22:26.072 --> 22:27.205
Exactly.

22:27.240 --> 22:28.641
Did he say why?

22:28.675 --> 22:31.877
No, but he was working her
like his life depended on it.

22:31.912 --> 22:33.345
I mean, it was like
he was on a mission.

22:33.379 --> 22:34.513
Did she go for him?

22:34.548 --> 22:35.815
Nah, total red light.

22:35.849 --> 22:37.149
Boop, boop, boop.

22:37.183 --> 22:38.883
Gate's down, train's coming,
time to move on.

22:38.918 --> 22:40.485
But not Mike.

22:40.519 --> 22:41.686
Not on this night.

22:41.720 --> 22:43.321
So what did he do?

22:43.355 --> 22:45.189
He counters
with some authorizing.

22:45.223 --> 22:46.624
Authorizing, huh?

22:46.659 --> 22:47.792
You know, making it seem like

22:47.827 --> 22:49.193
the last thing on his mind
is hooking up.

22:49.261 --> 22:52.296
Nah. He just finds her
interesting and wants to talk.

22:52.331 --> 22:54.298
But she doesn't bite,
so he tries an m-swig.

22:54.333 --> 22:56.533
Tells her he knows this girl
who's cheating on his friend.

22:56.568 --> 22:57.868
Should he tell his friend?

22:57.902 --> 22:59.402
'Cause women
love to give advice,

22:59.437 --> 23:01.237
but she's still
giving him the heisman,

23:01.272 --> 23:03.139
so he tries a butter job.

23:03.174 --> 23:04.842
A butter job, what's that?

23:04.876 --> 23:06.810
It's when you flirt
with the mark's friend.

23:06.845 --> 23:08.645
And that's when
he started getting traction.

23:08.680 --> 23:10.580
Immediately follows with
a yank-and-chain reversal,

23:10.614 --> 23:12.147
sees he's got her on the hook.

23:12.182 --> 23:14.183
So he goes right for
the Bailey ultimatum.

23:14.217 --> 23:15.985
Boom! Signature move.

23:16.019 --> 23:18.053
Says he has to leave,

23:18.088 --> 23:20.222
forcing the mark
to make a quick decision

23:20.256 --> 23:22.925
whether to go
with you or not.

23:22.960 --> 23:25.094
And what did she do?
Next thing you know,

23:25.128 --> 23:28.329
the two of them are walking
on their way outta there.

23:30.332 --> 23:32.834
You know, you have
some beautiful eyes.

23:32.869 --> 23:34.769
Seriously?

23:34.804 --> 23:36.104
What?
It's a numbers game.

23:36.138 --> 23:37.839
I strike out 90% of the time.

23:37.874 --> 23:39.908
Thus restoring
my faith in my gender.

23:39.942 --> 23:41.776
So this mark
that he was working,

23:41.811 --> 23:43.243
does she have a name?

23:43.277 --> 23:44.778
Lisa.

23:44.813 --> 23:48.916
The greatest pickup
I have ever seen.

23:48.950 --> 23:52.352
It's a damn shame she'll never
make it into Mike's ledger.

23:52.387 --> 23:54.221
What ledger?

23:54.255 --> 23:56.189
It's literally
hundreds of women

23:56.224 --> 23:57.525
that Bailey slept with.

23:57.559 --> 23:59.059
Or so he claims.

23:59.093 --> 24:00.527
It seems legit to me.

24:00.561 --> 24:02.795
Most of these shots
are pretty racy.

24:02.830 --> 24:05.098
All with nicknames and dates.

24:05.133 --> 24:07.134
June 9, 2010, "Carnal Carrie."

24:07.168 --> 24:09.602
June 12, 2010,

24:09.637 --> 24:10.737
"Mesmerizing Marjan."

24:10.771 --> 24:11.871
Mm.
Whoa.

24:11.906 --> 24:13.140
Sorry.

24:13.174 --> 24:14.707
Is there a Lisa in there
from two days ago?

24:14.742 --> 24:16.208
No. The last entry
was over a month ago.

24:16.243 --> 24:17.876
So Pablo was right,
she didn't make it in.

24:17.911 --> 24:19.545
We gotta find Lisa.

24:19.579 --> 24:21.213
She could be our other woman.

24:21.248 --> 24:24.083
Hey, so our friends Max
and Pablo just alibied out.

24:24.117 --> 24:26.218
They were both at work
when Mike was poisoned.

24:26.253 --> 24:27.619
"Limber Lucy."

24:27.654 --> 24:29.155
And, boy, is she ever.

24:29.189 --> 24:30.722
I don't know what
this dude Bailey was into,

24:30.757 --> 24:32.723
but whatever it is,
he had it going on.

24:32.758 --> 24:34.926
Really?
This impresses you?

24:34.960 --> 24:37.062
These women are pathetic
for falling for this guy.

24:37.096 --> 24:39.964
And Bailey, Bailey was just
a-a con man and a liar.

24:39.998 --> 24:43.768
Thank you. At least there is
one real man amongst us.

24:43.802 --> 24:44.936
Ryan, why don't you take
the situation

24:44.970 --> 24:46.104
down to the magic bottle

24:46.138 --> 24:48.004
and see if we can get
an I.D. On Lisa

24:48.039 --> 24:50.774
and find out why Bailey
might have been targeting her?

24:54.879 --> 24:57.981
Beckett, when exactly did
Ryan and Jenny start dating?

24:58.015 --> 25:00.684
Mm. I think it was
around 2009.

25:00.718 --> 25:02.852
She got him that ugly tie
for their 2-week anniversary,

25:02.887 --> 25:05.321
so, like, easter, April.

25:05.355 --> 25:07.690
Meaning, by may 2009,

25:07.724 --> 25:09.625
they had been dating a month.

25:09.659 --> 25:10.793
Yeah, why?

25:12.862 --> 25:15.931
Bailey's may 20, 2009 entry.

25:17.734 --> 25:19.367
My gosh.
That's Jenny.

25:19.402 --> 25:21.203
S
Not just Jenny.

25:21.724 --> 25:23.327
"Gyrating Jenny."

25:28.699 --> 25:30.293
Yeah, I recognize him.

25:30.373 --> 25:32.300
In here with a couple of friends
two nights ago.

25:32.346 --> 25:34.013
One of those friends told us
that he left with a woman.

25:34.048 --> 25:36.282
Lisa. Do you know her?
Yeah.

25:36.317 --> 25:38.217
She's a regular.
Does she have a last name?

25:38.252 --> 25:39.717
Give me a sec.

25:41.520 --> 25:44.022
I think I like
this place, partner.

25:44.057 --> 25:45.324
Dude, you're a cop.

25:45.358 --> 25:46.858
This is a midtown bar.

25:46.892 --> 25:50.528
Women here, they're looking
for lawyers and bankers.

25:50.563 --> 25:51.696
I bank.

25:51.730 --> 25:53.198
Well,
you are on your own.

25:53.232 --> 25:54.799
I'm getting married on Sunday.

25:54.834 --> 25:56.033
Exactly.

25:56.068 --> 25:57.668
So this is your last chance
to be my wingman.

25:57.702 --> 25:59.170
Help me get a plus one.

25:59.204 --> 26:02.373
I think I'm gonna try
an m-swig.

26:02.407 --> 26:05.142
Dude, you can't be serious.

26:05.177 --> 26:07.211
What are you thinking,
butter job?

26:07.245 --> 26:09.347
I checked credit card slips
from the other night.

26:09.381 --> 26:11.181
Her name's Lisa Hill.

26:11.215 --> 26:14.017
Lisa Hill.

26:14.051 --> 26:15.885
So not only
is Lisa Hill married,

26:15.919 --> 26:18.054
she is also an heiress...

26:18.089 --> 26:20.056
Daughter to Stephanie Dashby.

26:20.091 --> 26:22.058
Of Dashby Publishing?

26:22.093 --> 26:24.827
Which puts her
in Forbes top 400.

26:24.862 --> 26:27.162
Bailey was hunting
big game.

26:27.197 --> 26:29.731
He knew he couldn't close
the deal as a junior analyst,

26:29.765 --> 26:31.600
that's why he used
the alias with her,

26:31.634 --> 26:33.735
same way he used it with
big-shot lawyer Holly Franklin.

26:33.769 --> 26:35.104
Yeah, well,
according to her maid,

26:35.138 --> 26:36.938
Lisa Hill packed up
and left her apartment

26:36.973 --> 26:39.308
for her house in montauk
at 6:30 P.M.

26:39.342 --> 26:42.211
Half an hour
after our kill zone.

26:42.245 --> 26:44.212
Plus she also had easy access
to our poison.

26:44.246 --> 26:47.015
Her sister owns a drug company
that manufactures it.

26:47.049 --> 26:48.516
This is about the money.

26:48.550 --> 26:50.018
Bailey only used
the Jake identity

26:50.052 --> 26:52.053
with Holly and Lisa.
They're both rich.

26:52.087 --> 26:53.721
So what are you thinking,
an extortion plot?

26:53.755 --> 26:56.391
Bricks of cash... probably from
previous successes.

26:56.425 --> 26:58.026
He targets wealthy women,

26:58.060 --> 27:00.093
tries to put them
in compromising situations...

27:00.128 --> 27:01.395
And then makes them
pay their way out...

27:01.429 --> 27:02.529
Except Lisa Hill wouldn't pay.

27:02.563 --> 27:03.630
We need to get her in here.

27:03.664 --> 27:04.797
And we will...

27:04.832 --> 27:07.067
First thing in the morning.

27:07.101 --> 27:08.735
So...

27:08.769 --> 27:10.404
What are we gonna do?

27:10.438 --> 27:11.804
About what?

27:11.839 --> 27:13.573
Well, we have to tell Ryan
about Jenny.

27:13.607 --> 27:15.741
What? Why?

27:15.775 --> 27:17.476
Castle, if we were getting
married, would you want to know

27:17.511 --> 27:19.045
about all the guys
that I've slept with?

27:19.079 --> 27:20.312
All?

27:20.347 --> 27:21.647
Seriously?

27:21.681 --> 27:23.815
You sign women's chests
at book readings.

27:23.850 --> 27:25.651
You cannot be shocked
that I'm not a virgin.

27:25.685 --> 27:28.554
It's just the word... "All"

27:28.588 --> 27:30.122
suggests

27:30.157 --> 27:31.622
a lot.

27:31.657 --> 27:34.759
How many are we talkin'...
Exactly?

27:34.793 --> 27:37.395
Are you really asking
for my number?

27:37.430 --> 27:40.198
You show me yours,
I'll show you mine.

27:41.367 --> 27:42.567
Men.

27:42.601 --> 27:44.135
You all want to know,

27:44.170 --> 27:45.937
but you don't want to know.

27:45.971 --> 27:48.772
Listen, all women
have their secrets,

27:48.806 --> 27:50.740
including Jenny, and sometimes,

27:50.775 --> 27:52.276
for the sake of a relationship,

27:52.310 --> 27:54.511
it is better not to share.

28:03.487 --> 28:05.521
That is some dress.

28:05.556 --> 28:07.290
Isn't she stunning?

28:07.324 --> 28:09.024
After striking out all day,

28:09.059 --> 28:10.793
we finally tried J.D.F.'S
on Madison.

28:10.827 --> 28:12.828
- And, boy, did we score.

28:14.364 --> 28:16.499
Well, that sounds like it's
about more than just a dress.

28:16.533 --> 28:18.267
Well, not only did Alexis find

28:18.302 --> 28:19.934
this exquisite little number,

28:19.969 --> 28:21.836
we were completely charmed
by the proprietor...

28:21.870 --> 28:23.305
John Danton Farnesworth.

28:23.339 --> 28:24.672
J.D.F.

28:24.707 --> 28:26.174
So as we're paying,

28:26.209 --> 28:27.509
Mr. Farnesworth
is about to close up,

28:27.543 --> 28:30.979
when his grandson,
John Danton Farnesworth III,

28:31.013 --> 28:32.680
picked him up for dinner.

28:32.715 --> 28:34.216
Goes by J.D. So cute.

28:34.250 --> 28:36.517
He is a lovely young man...

28:36.585 --> 28:37.618
Freshman at Columbia.

28:37.652 --> 28:38.652
Which I'm applying to,

28:38.686 --> 28:40.554
so of course
I grilled him about it.

28:40.589 --> 28:41.722
And the next thing you know,

28:41.756 --> 28:44.458
they invite us
to join them for dinner.

28:44.493 --> 28:46.660
So who was the wingman,

28:46.694 --> 28:48.329
the grandpa or the kid?

28:48.363 --> 28:49.330
The what?

28:49.364 --> 28:50.731
Dad...

28:50.765 --> 28:52.365
They were total gentlemen.

28:52.399 --> 28:54.967
They even invited us to their
family's annual charity event...

28:55.002 --> 28:57.303
A private concert
with Lady Gaga.

28:58.506 --> 29:00.340
But it's the same time
as the wedding.

29:00.374 --> 29:02.308
I know, I promised,

29:02.343 --> 29:04.076
and of course I'll go
if you want me to, it's just...

29:04.111 --> 29:06.479
This is the first time I've
felt this way since Ashley,

29:06.514 --> 29:07.579
and...

29:07.614 --> 29:09.047
You don't have to go
to the wedding.

29:09.081 --> 29:10.416
You are released from
your plus one duties.

29:10.417 --> 29:11.750
Thanks, dad.

29:11.784 --> 29:13.185
Which I guess means
you don't need this dress.

29:13.219 --> 29:14.352
Don't be silly, darling.

29:14.386 --> 29:15.853
It is a black-tie benefit.
Yeah.

29:15.887 --> 29:17.588
And after dinner,

29:17.623 --> 29:19.257
- John opened...
- The shop...

29:19.291 --> 29:21.392
And I got one, too.

29:22.528 --> 29:24.094
So it's a win-win.

29:25.631 --> 29:27.131
I can't
believe you bailed on me.

29:27.166 --> 29:29.033
We were there till
2:30 in the morning.

29:29.067 --> 29:30.200
Yeah, I was five minutes
from sealing the deal

29:30.234 --> 29:31.635
with my plus one.

29:31.669 --> 29:32.969
You really think after
standing there for three hours,

29:33.003 --> 29:34.137
another five minutes
of me standing there

29:34.172 --> 29:35.338
would've made any difference?

29:35.373 --> 29:36.839
Yeah.
She was into me.

29:36.874 --> 29:39.643
She said that she thought
solving murders was "cute."

29:39.677 --> 29:40.810
Yeah, but you didn't have to
tell her friend

29:40.844 --> 29:41.978
you were engaged.

29:42.012 --> 29:43.180
No, no, you're right.

29:43.214 --> 29:44.481
I could've totally just...
Just lied to her

29:44.515 --> 29:45.882
and hooked up with her.

29:45.916 --> 29:48.116
And do you have to be
such a cliche?

29:48.151 --> 29:51.387
Stuffing your face with that...
That... that thing?

29:51.421 --> 29:53.088
Hey, don't touch my doughnut.

29:53.122 --> 29:55.491
Hey, Ryan... eat this in front of me.
I've had enough of you!

29:55.525 --> 29:56.725
Don't you... don't you...

29:56.759 --> 29:58.960
Hey, hey, hey!
Break it up.

29:58.995 --> 30:00.429
- Guys!
- What the hell is going on?

30:00.463 --> 30:01.630
Talk to hunger strike
over here.

30:01.665 --> 30:03.231
He was flaunting that doughnut.

30:03.265 --> 30:04.599
I was eating it.

30:04.633 --> 30:06.234
Ryan, you okay?

30:06.268 --> 30:07.602
A cleanse for nine days...

30:07.636 --> 30:09.103
Don't you think it's time
to let it go?

30:09.137 --> 30:10.605
No, no, no. I'm... I'm fine.

30:10.639 --> 30:13.140
I'm... I'm sorry, everybody.
Sorry, bro.

30:13.175 --> 30:15.643
So any luck finding Lisa Hill?

30:15.678 --> 30:18.045
Yeah, we tracked her down
at a Spa in Montauk.

30:18.080 --> 30:20.980
Yeah, she's going from
mud wrap to murder rap,

30:21.015 --> 30:23.383
exfoliation to interrogation,

30:23.418 --> 30:24.818
manicure to manacles,

30:24.852 --> 30:27.153
shiatsu to...

30:29.023 --> 30:32.158
Shiatsu...

30:32.193 --> 30:33.393
Shiatsu...

30:33.428 --> 30:35.461
Unis are on their way
to pick her up now.

30:35.495 --> 30:38.731
Do you recognize him,
Ms. Hill?

30:38.765 --> 30:40.999
Yes, it's Jake.

30:41.034 --> 30:42.535
Yes, Jake Hendricks.

30:42.569 --> 30:43.869
Or so you thought,

30:43.903 --> 30:46.372
until you found out his
real name was Michael Bailey

30:46.406 --> 30:49.174
and he was trying
to blackmail you.

30:49.209 --> 30:50.675
Isn't that right?

30:50.710 --> 30:52.644
Blackmail? I...

30:52.678 --> 30:54.512
Don't know
what you're talking about.

30:54.547 --> 30:55.714
I think you do.

30:55.748 --> 30:57.482
You realized
that you had been played,

30:57.516 --> 30:59.817
and you decided to take
your revenge.

30:59.852 --> 31:03.722
Your sister owns
a, a drug company?

31:03.756 --> 31:05.423
She must have given you
the colchicine you used

31:05.458 --> 31:06.690
to poison him, didn't she?

31:06.725 --> 31:08.259
No.

31:08.293 --> 31:09.993
Look, I didn't get revenge

31:10.027 --> 31:11.595
because I never knew
what he was up to.

31:11.630 --> 31:13.597
But he was up to something.

31:13.632 --> 31:14.898
I should've realized

31:14.932 --> 31:16.367
when he was hitting on me
so hard at the bar,

31:16.401 --> 31:17.534
but he was cute,

31:17.569 --> 31:19.303
and my husband
is more interested in work

31:19.337 --> 31:21.171
than actually living, so...

31:21.205 --> 31:23.606
I brought him home,
and it was nice.

31:23.641 --> 31:25.541
But then I came out
of the bathroom,

31:25.576 --> 31:27.076
and caught him on the computer.

31:27.110 --> 31:28.711
I figured he was trying
to steal credit cards

31:28.746 --> 31:30.246
banking info,

31:30.281 --> 31:31.714
so I kicked his ass out.

31:31.749 --> 31:35.318
But I swear, that was
the last time I saw him.

31:35.352 --> 31:37.387
Yeah.

31:37.421 --> 31:39.321
Bailey sent an e-mail,
all right, to himself.

31:39.355 --> 31:40.889
Why would he
e-mail himself?

31:40.923 --> 31:42.857
Because he attached several
documents from Hill's computer.

31:42.892 --> 31:44.192
What kind of documents?

31:44.226 --> 31:45.360
Confidential ones...

31:45.395 --> 31:48.563
Relating to
K.P.W.. Mining Corporation.

31:48.598 --> 31:50.098
Lisa Hill's husband Ron Hill

31:50.132 --> 31:52.200
is the investment banker
representing K.P.W..

31:52.234 --> 31:55.336
On the possible sale of the company.

31:55.370 --> 31:57.305
That's Lisa Hill's husband?

31:57.339 --> 31:58.639
We saw him
at the Global 12 offices.

31:58.674 --> 32:00.808
Yep, and Ron Hill
is representing K.P.W..

32:00.842 --> 32:02.410
It's
a multibillion-dollar deal.

32:02.444 --> 32:04.812
So Bailey
was engaged in covert ops.

32:04.846 --> 32:06.614
He targeted
Ron Hill's wife Lisa,

32:06.648 --> 32:09.917
slept with her in order to steal
K.P.W... Corporate secrets.

32:09.951 --> 32:11.484
That's espionage.

32:11.519 --> 32:13.720
More like sexpionage.

32:13.754 --> 32:15.455
More like motive.

32:21.123 --> 32:23.540
So Bailey was using
his pickup artist skills

32:23.575 --> 32:25.175
to sleep with Ron Hill's wife

32:25.210 --> 32:27.578
and steal corporate secrets.

32:27.613 --> 32:29.813
Man, there's a "penetrating
enemy lines" joke

32:29.847 --> 32:31.514
here somewhere.

32:31.548 --> 32:33.516
You know, Ron must have
hit the roof

32:33.550 --> 32:35.986
when he discovered that
those files were stolen.

32:36.020 --> 32:37.954
Sure. Ron got screwed
on the deal.

32:37.989 --> 32:39.522
And his wife got screwed.

32:39.556 --> 32:40.824
Boy, if anybody ever had

32:40.864 --> 32:42.157
a motive for murder,
it was Ron Hill.

32:42.192 --> 32:44.160
Yeah, except he was
in negotiations

32:44.194 --> 32:45.961
during
the poison-and-kill zone

32:45.996 --> 32:47.496
and his wife Lisa alibied, too.

32:47.530 --> 32:48.831
Anand I've been lookin'
at the K.P.W... Deal.

32:48.865 --> 32:50.499
Turns out
that they're represented

32:50.533 --> 32:51.900
by Keller, Braun and Franklin.

32:51.935 --> 32:53.602
Guess who their lead attorney is.
Holly Franklin?

32:53.670 --> 32:55.270
Yep, miss no-tell-hotel
herself.

32:55.304 --> 32:57.339
The only reason
you guys didn't run into her

32:57.373 --> 32:59.642
at Global 12 Consolidated is
that we were still holding her.

32:59.676 --> 33:01.776
That explains
the Lisa and Holly connection.

33:01.810 --> 33:03.778
Yeah, but it begs the question,

33:03.812 --> 33:05.647
how many other women
did Bailey target

33:05.681 --> 33:07.481
in this
little sexpionage scheme?

33:07.516 --> 33:09.517
All right, you guys get a list
of all the people at K.P.W...

33:09.551 --> 33:10.985
That were working the sale,

33:11.020 --> 33:13.821
including the banking
and legal teams. Right.

33:13.856 --> 33:16.190
There's no way that Bailey
was working this alone.

33:16.224 --> 33:18.459
He's too junior.

33:18.493 --> 33:20.294
And besides,

33:20.328 --> 33:22.796
he was on leave.

33:22.830 --> 33:25.633
And who authorized the leave?

33:25.667 --> 33:28.035
Yes, I authorized his leave.

33:28.069 --> 33:30.638
You gave him a fake I.D.
And cash bonuses, Mr. Harris.

33:30.672 --> 33:32.473
And I've already told you, I
don't know anything about that.

33:32.507 --> 33:33.974
Okay, well, how about this?

33:34.008 --> 33:36.676
Bailey slept with Holly Franklin
and Ron Hill's wife Lisa

33:36.710 --> 33:38.678
to steal K.P.W... Secrets
for your negotiation.

33:38.712 --> 33:41.080
Did you know about that?

33:41.114 --> 33:42.415
Come on, Harris.

33:42.449 --> 33:44.617
This couldn't be Bailey's idea.

33:44.652 --> 33:47.654
You're his boss, and you're
Global 12 Consolidated's

33:47.688 --> 33:49.822
lead negotiator
for the K.P.W... Deal.

33:49.856 --> 33:51.690
So...

33:51.724 --> 33:53.158
How did it start?

33:53.193 --> 33:55.694
Did you happen to see
Bailey out

33:55.728 --> 33:56.995
one night at some bar,

33:57.029 --> 33:59.164
working his magic,

33:59.199 --> 34:02.000
realized that you could use his
ability to your advantage?

34:02.034 --> 34:04.703
That is nothing
but wild speculation.

34:04.737 --> 34:07.572
You have no proof whatsoever
of any wrong doing on my part

34:07.606 --> 34:09.239
or Global 12.

34:09.274 --> 34:11.242
Look, I don't care about
corporate malfeasance.

34:11.275 --> 34:13.177
I want Michael Bailey's killer.

34:13.212 --> 34:14.745
And how do you think
I can help?

34:14.779 --> 34:16.614
You tell me me where he's been
staying for the past month,

34:16.648 --> 34:18.449
tell me who else was targeted,

34:18.483 --> 34:21.219
and who he was with the day
that he was killed.

34:22.920 --> 34:26.022
Unless you're actually gonna
charge me with something...

34:28.192 --> 34:30.594
I'm leaving.

34:34.297 --> 34:37.534
There are more than 300
female executives

34:37.568 --> 34:39.034
at K.P.W...

34:39.068 --> 34:40.969
Bailey could have targeted
any one of them.

34:41.003 --> 34:42.871
Not to mention all the women
at the law firm

34:42.905 --> 34:44.873
and the investment bank who are
also working on the deal.

34:44.907 --> 34:46.641
And we still have no idea
where he was poisoned.

34:46.676 --> 34:48.176
Any luck?

34:48.210 --> 34:50.246
Nope. There's too big
a pool of possible marks

34:50.280 --> 34:52.047
that Bailey
could've slept with.

34:52.081 --> 34:55.116
Yeah, uh, speaking of that,

34:55.150 --> 34:56.451
you know...

34:57.886 --> 34:59.587
Ryan's my boy,

34:59.622 --> 35:01.756
so I gotta tell him
about Jenny and Bailey.

35:03.191 --> 35:05.526
You only told me
I couldn't tell Ryan.

35:06.962 --> 35:09.564
Look, Espo, I appreciate
your point of view,

35:09.598 --> 35:12.098
but the guy hasn't eaten
in a week and a half.

35:12.133 --> 35:15.001
And teter that
doughnut incident, I don't...

35:19.874 --> 35:22.609
I'll just take this
back to my desk.

35:24.111 --> 35:25.912
Sit down, bro.

35:25.946 --> 35:27.813
What?

35:27.847 --> 35:29.248
What?

35:31.151 --> 35:32.585
Why do you guys
look so serious?

35:32.619 --> 35:34.620
You should...
Eat something.

35:34.655 --> 35:36.722
Yeah.
You look hungry.

35:36.757 --> 35:38.491
You've got the posture
of a feral cat.

35:38.525 --> 35:40.760
Guys, I made sacred vow
to the woman I love.

35:40.794 --> 35:42.360
- Is that Moo Shu pork?
- Yes.

35:42.395 --> 35:45.029
And it is delicious.
Come on, bro.

35:45.063 --> 35:46.998
Just eat.

35:49.067 --> 35:52.203
You weren't
kidding about this Moo Shu pork.

35:52.237 --> 35:53.538
Come on!
Right?

35:53.572 --> 35:55.039
Pass the spring rolls, please.

35:55.073 --> 35:56.608
Yeah.

35:56.642 --> 35:58.276
So...

35:58.310 --> 36:00.811
You know how
we all love Jenny, right?

36:00.812 --> 36:02.112
Yeah, what about her?

36:02.146 --> 36:03.480
Well, it's just that ...

36:03.515 --> 36:05.615
that ledger of Bailey's...

36:05.616 --> 36:07.149
Hey, is she in that?

36:08.719 --> 36:09.952
These... these... memory lapses...

36:09.986 --> 36:11.788
Could you pass
the fried rice?

36:11.789 --> 36:13.055
Yeah.

36:13.056 --> 36:14.990
So you've known all along?

36:14.991 --> 36:18.961
Nah. I was telling Jenny about
Javi's antics last night...

36:18.995 --> 36:21.297
And we got
to talking about the case.

36:21.331 --> 36:22.864
And she told me
that she met Bailey at a bar

36:22.898 --> 36:24.265
a month or so
after we started up.

36:24.300 --> 36:26.034
She told you about that?

36:26.068 --> 36:27.602
Yeah. She had no idea

36:27.637 --> 36:29.671
that he was some kind of
professional pickup artist.

36:29.706 --> 36:31.139
And you're not upset at all?

36:31.173 --> 36:33.975
Hey, it's not
like we were exclusive.

36:34.009 --> 36:36.545
Is that Mongolian beef?

36:36.579 --> 36:38.346
Man.

36:39.681 --> 36:41.515
Thanks, dot.

36:42.884 --> 36:44.752
Get this. So I've been
trying to figure out

36:44.786 --> 36:47.187
where else Bailey might have
been staying for the past month,

36:47.222 --> 36:49.156
and when we got on to
his corporate spying

36:49.190 --> 36:51.325
for Global 12 Consolidated,

36:51.360 --> 36:53.160
I looked into
their corporate housing.

36:53.194 --> 36:54.828
That's a great idea.

36:54.862 --> 36:56.496
Yeah. Why didn't I
think of that?

36:56.530 --> 36:57.964
Turns out Mike Bailey
has been checked in

36:57.998 --> 36:59.966
to the oaks on Park Avenue
for the last month

37:00.000 --> 37:02.201
under his alias Jake Hendricks.

37:02.236 --> 37:03.870
Well, what are you
sitting around for?

37:03.904 --> 37:06.740
Do you mind
if I take the spare rib?

37:06.774 --> 37:08.174
Okay.

37:08.208 --> 37:09.975
You're welcome to look.

37:10.009 --> 37:11.309
But we got the call yesterday,

37:11.344 --> 37:12.644
Mr. Hendricks
wasn't coming back.

37:12.679 --> 37:14.045
What'd you do
with all his stuff?

37:14.080 --> 37:16.047
Per his company's instructions,
we gave his clothes

37:16.082 --> 37:17.850
and personal belongings
to goodwill,

37:17.884 --> 37:20.151
and the place has been scrubbed,
bedding laundered.

37:31.988 --> 37:33.294
Hey, javier,

37:33.316 --> 37:34.565
check this out.

37:34.600 --> 37:36.333
Chocolate blast.

37:36.368 --> 37:38.703
It's a protein shake.

37:38.737 --> 37:41.471
"Made with
whey-protein isolate."

37:41.506 --> 37:43.407
You always stock this drink?

37:43.441 --> 37:44.941
Yeah.
It's all standard.

37:44.975 --> 37:46.777
It's exactly what Lanie said
that Bailey had in his system

37:46.811 --> 37:48.311
that delivered the colchicine.

37:48.345 --> 37:50.280
This is where
he was poisoned, bro.

37:53.168 --> 37:54.778
Looks like we found
the murder weapon.

37:54.825 --> 37:56.864
Lanie says that the chocolate
shake from the oaks

37:56.963 --> 37:59.230
is a perfect match
for the contents

37:59.265 --> 38:00.565
of Bailey's stomach.

38:00.599 --> 38:02.034
It's what delivered
the lethal dose of colchicine.

38:02.068 --> 38:03.201
Yo.

38:03.235 --> 38:04.703
So the doorman at the oaks
confirms

38:04.737 --> 38:07.038
that Bailey was there during
the whole poison time window.

38:07.072 --> 38:08.605
He asked not to be disturbed.

38:08.640 --> 38:10.675
Yeah, I bet, because sexpionage

38:10.709 --> 38:13.077
can be so much more demanding
than espionage.

38:13.111 --> 38:14.244
True.

38:14.279 --> 38:15.713
So I'm guessing
he had a visitor.

38:15.747 --> 38:17.748
Yep, someone who had been
there a few times before.

38:17.783 --> 38:19.383
Security cam photo capture.

38:20.752 --> 38:23.019
Look familiar?

38:24.855 --> 38:26.289
If we could focus
on the third quarter,

38:26.323 --> 38:28.624
I believe that would be the most
productive way to move forward.

38:30.661 --> 38:31.961
Excuse me.

38:31.996 --> 38:34.164
Sorry to interrupt again.

38:35.499 --> 38:36.800
What's up, Seth?

38:36.834 --> 38:39.068
Nothing.
Nothing at all.

38:39.102 --> 38:40.602
Look, detective,
I have already told you

38:40.636 --> 38:42.637
everything that I know
about Michael Bailey.

38:42.672 --> 38:44.740
Now please...

38:44.774 --> 38:46.374
Leave.

38:46.409 --> 38:49.044
Actually, we're not here
for you, Mr. Harris.

38:49.079 --> 38:51.914
That would be the S.E.C.,
soon.

38:51.948 --> 38:53.716
Today...

38:53.750 --> 38:55.783
We are here for a woman,

38:55.818 --> 38:58.319
someone who works for K.P.W...

38:58.353 --> 39:00.654
And also knew Michael Bailey...

39:00.689 --> 39:04.425
Your C.O.O., Amy Kemp.

39:04.459 --> 39:06.728
You're under arrest for
the murder of Michael Bailey.

39:06.762 --> 39:10.631
Pleasure doing business
with you, Seth.

39:10.665 --> 39:12.899
Let's go.

39:14.501 --> 39:16.737
She said "killing him
was just business."

39:16.771 --> 39:18.939
He had to die to protect
the corporate secrets.

39:18.973 --> 39:20.941
Yeah, I guess the fact that
he won't be around

39:20.975 --> 39:23.143
to dupe other women
was an added benefit.

39:23.177 --> 39:25.145
Bailey worked her
like all the other women...

39:25.179 --> 39:26.946
Made her feel special,

39:26.980 --> 39:29.081
got her to fall for him...
But somewhere along the way,

39:29.116 --> 39:31.016
she figured out
what he was up to.

39:31.051 --> 39:32.785
I'm just glad
I'm out of the game.

39:32.819 --> 39:36.421
The games are only
beginning for you, my friend.

39:36.456 --> 39:39.024
Hey. So what's up
with your plus one?

39:39.059 --> 39:41.660
It's on.

39:41.694 --> 39:44.028
That's all I'm sayin'.

39:47.967 --> 39:49.100
Lanie.

39:49.135 --> 39:50.668
Hey.

39:50.702 --> 39:52.603
Hello, Javier.

39:52.638 --> 39:53.805
This is Toby.

39:53.839 --> 39:55.173
Pleased to meet you.

39:55.207 --> 39:57.408
Yeah, you, too.

39:57.442 --> 39:58.876
This is Jody.

39:58.910 --> 40:00.010
Nice to meet you.

40:00.044 --> 40:01.678
Pleasure.

40:01.712 --> 40:03.446
Excuse me. I need to find
the ladies room.

40:03.481 --> 40:04.614
Okay.

40:06.651 --> 40:09.820
You two talk.
I'll get us seats.

40:09.854 --> 40:11.688
Thank you, Toby.

40:13.792 --> 40:15.057
Toby, huh?

40:15.092 --> 40:16.325
What do you mean,
"Toby, huh?"

40:16.359 --> 40:17.860
I don't know.
You tell me.

40:17.895 --> 40:19.595
You and I broke up
two months ago,

40:19.629 --> 40:21.630
so unless you thought
I joined a convent,

40:21.665 --> 40:23.232
you need to take a step back.

40:23.267 --> 40:25.401
So you two serious now?
Yeah, we're serious...

40:25.435 --> 40:27.303
About dancing.

40:27.337 --> 40:29.038
That's why his boyfriend
let me borrow him.

40:29.072 --> 40:31.539
Besides, I figured I'd need
somebody to keep me company

40:31.573 --> 40:34.009
while you flirted with all of
Jenny's sorority sisters.

40:34.043 --> 40:36.011
Toby's boyfriend?

40:36.045 --> 40:37.512
And I seem to recall you here

40:37.546 --> 40:40.148
with the center
for the new York liberty.

40:40.183 --> 40:41.683
She's my cousin.

40:41.717 --> 40:43.718
I heard you were coming
with a date,

40:43.752 --> 40:45.753
so I thought
I had to have somebody...

40:47.823 --> 40:50.324
You look great, you know?

40:50.358 --> 40:51.826
Yeah, I know.

40:53.862 --> 40:56.230
Can I show you to your seat?

40:56.264 --> 40:58.365
That would be nice.

41:04.471 --> 41:06.572
Hopefully, it... it...

41:06.606 --> 41:08.107
Castle.

41:08.142 --> 41:09.943
You look like a lost puppy.

41:09.977 --> 41:11.277
Where's your date?

41:11.312 --> 41:13.279
At a Lady Gaga concert
with a teenage boy.

41:13.314 --> 41:14.580
How do I compete with that?

41:14.614 --> 41:16.049
No. I'm sorry.

41:16.083 --> 41:18.684
Yeah, me, too. I hate
going to weddings alone.

41:18.719 --> 41:21.386
Well, maybe we could be
each other's plus one.

41:21.420 --> 41:23.355
Yeah, and then avoid the stigma

41:23.389 --> 41:24.857
of sitting
at the singles' table.

41:24.891 --> 41:26.658
Yes, that would be nice.
I would like...

41:26.692 --> 41:28.426
Okay. Good, good, good.

41:28.461 --> 41:29.895
Look at him.

41:29.929 --> 41:31.563
He looks so happy.

41:32.765 --> 41:34.499
Hey. I'm so glad
you're here.

41:34.533 --> 41:35.632
Where else
are we gonna be? Mwah.

41:35.667 --> 41:36.800
You look fantastic.

41:36.835 --> 41:39.036
Yeah, we clean up
pretty nice, huh?

41:41.506 --> 41:43.607
Jenny, you look amazing.

41:43.641 --> 41:45.476
Thank you, Rick.

41:45.510 --> 41:48.812
No. No, no, no, no, no.
You can't see her yet.

41:48.847 --> 41:51.214
Kevin...
You are a lucky man.

41:51.249 --> 41:53.750
Don't I know it?

41:53.784 --> 41:55.252
Ready, bro?

41:55.286 --> 41:56.652
I think so.

41:56.687 --> 41:58.088
Okay. We're gonna
see you in there.

41:58.122 --> 41:59.956
Okay.

42:01.658 --> 42:05.728
You know, I gotta say,
I kind of envy him.

42:05.763 --> 42:08.230
Well, who knows, Castle?
Maybe third time's the charm.

42:08.265 --> 42:09.598
Yeah.

42:09.632 --> 42:12.301
Could be.

42:12.335 --> 42:13.502
Shall we?

42:13.536 --> 42:15.137
Yeah.
