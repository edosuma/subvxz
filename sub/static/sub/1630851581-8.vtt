Yeah! Coming!

01:13.907 --> 01:16.243
Wow! 12:15!

01:16.243 --> 01:18.870
I think you just beat
your record for sleeping in!

01:18.870 --> 01:22.624
Yeah, I know, right?
Weekends are my chill time.

01:24.710 --> 01:27.796
‐ Where's Mom and Dad?
‐ Shooting their movie.

01:27.796 --> 01:29.464
Not without that camera battery.

01:34.553 --> 01:36.179
‐ Hey, Dad!
‐ Liv, we have a problem!

01:36.179 --> 01:38.056
‐ Your mom forgot ‐‐
‐ Correction.

01:38.056 --> 01:40.684
Your dad forgot
the camera battery!

01:40.684 --> 01:42.561
No problem, I'll bring it over.

01:42.561 --> 01:45.230
‐ Thanks, sweetie!
‐ Thanks!

01:49.026 --> 01:50.986
Let me guess, you're not coming?

01:50.986 --> 01:54.197
Like I said,
I'm in my chill zone.

01:57.701 --> 01:58.702
Dodged that one!

02:10.714 --> 02:11.715
Liv!

02:15.510 --> 02:17.304
‐ Hey! What's up, Mike?
‐ (Panting)

02:17.763 --> 02:21.016
Charlie just asked me to go for
a walk with her on her birthday.

02:21.016 --> 02:24.686
‐ Really? Cool!
‐ No, not cool!

02:24.686 --> 02:28.440
We're meeting in 15.5 minutes
and I haven't found a gift yet!

02:29.775 --> 02:33.028
‐ You gotta to help me!
‐ What? Me? You mean now?

02:33.028 --> 02:35.572
Yeah, you'll know
just the right thing to get her!

02:36.198 --> 02:40.327
‐ Well, I have to...
‐ Please!

02:40.327 --> 02:43.538
‐ OK, fine. I'll help you.
‐ Yeah!

02:44.373 --> 02:46.625
But we need to hurry!
Let's move!

02:46.625 --> 02:49.127
Totally agree. Our conversation
already lost us 26 seconds.

02:51.546 --> 02:55.801
Hello? When do we shoot?
I've been up here an hour

02:55.801 --> 02:59.554
and can already feel the sun
aging my supple skin!

03:00.389 --> 03:02.724
‐ Yoohoo!
‐ Solarman!

03:04.267 --> 03:06.269
<i>Don't sweat it.</i>
<i>It won't be long!</i>

03:06.269 --> 03:08.689
<i>Plus, sweat will ruin</i>
<i>your makeup.</i>

03:08.689 --> 03:10.482
Urgh! Why isn't Liv here yet?

03:11.817 --> 03:14.111
You know what?
We'll just have to improvise.

03:14.111 --> 03:15.153
Huh?

03:39.636 --> 03:40.303
Boo!

03:40.846 --> 03:42.931
(Screaming)

03:48.812 --> 03:50.522
Aaah!

03:51.231 --> 03:54.067
What would she like? A Bluetooth
headset? A smartwatch?

03:54.067 --> 03:56.027
VR goggles?

03:56.027 --> 03:58.363
How about something less geeky,
like flowers?

03:58.363 --> 04:01.032
Flowers?
Why would she wants that?

04:01.032 --> 04:03.201
We should get moving, Mike.

04:04.244 --> 04:06.246
(Phone rings)

04:06.246 --> 04:08.123
<i>Greetings, kiddos!</i>
<i>Wouldn't you know it?</i>

04:08.415 --> 04:12.043
<i>I was preparing a surprise for</i>
<i>you when... a ghost appeared!</i>

04:12.043 --> 04:14.171
<i>It's a level sixer</i>
<i>called Raijin.</i>

04:14.171 --> 04:16.840
I see its boo‐signature
on the Brooklyn Bridge.

04:16.840 --> 04:19.801
The Brooklyn Bridge?
That's where my parents are!

04:19.801 --> 04:21.887
I guess shopping
will have to wait.

04:21.887 --> 04:23.889
Let's go, Ghost Force!

04:24.806 --> 04:27.267
<i>Ghost Force!</i>
<i>Don't fear the glow!</i>

04:32.731 --> 04:34.024
Fury!

04:35.108 --> 04:36.318
Krush!

04:37.694 --> 04:39.362
Myst!

04:42.699 --> 04:43.784
Ghost Force!

04:50.957 --> 04:52.250
Aaah!

04:57.672 --> 04:58.924
Where's Mom and Dad?

05:02.010 --> 05:03.053
Phew! They're safe!

05:04.930 --> 05:07.474
Which means
we can go ghost hunting!

05:13.814 --> 05:15.232
‐ Aaah!
‐ (Chuckles)

05:15.232 --> 05:17.192
Huh?

05:19.903 --> 05:20.821
Huh?

05:27.994 --> 05:30.205
‐ Boo!
‐ Aaah!

05:30.205 --> 05:31.915
(Giggles)

05:43.176 --> 05:44.594
(Growls)

05:46.680 --> 05:48.390
Huh? Huh?

05:53.812 --> 05:57.190
Oh, we're sorry! We just
wanted to shoot our movie!

05:57.190 --> 06:00.986
Our daughter was late with our
battery, so we had to improvise!

06:00.986 --> 06:03.530
‐ Sorry. This is all my ‐‐
‐ Mission.

06:03.530 --> 06:05.949
It's our mission
to stop the ghost.

06:06.950 --> 06:08.952
Let's go, Ghost Force!

06:08.952 --> 06:09.911
Mmm‐hmm.

06:16.293 --> 06:18.670
Can somebody
get me down from here?

06:22.340 --> 06:25.594
Why not tell me you had to
get the battery to your folks?

06:25.594 --> 06:28.388
You needed a gift.
I figured I could do both.

06:28.388 --> 06:30.515
How? Do you have a twin
I don't know about?

06:39.190 --> 06:41.151
This is not looking good,
Ms Jones!

06:41.151 --> 06:43.320
<i>I have just the thing.</i>

06:43.320 --> 06:45.322
<i>I wanted to surprise you</i>
<i>in person,</i>

06:45.322 --> 06:46.990
<i>but I guess it can't wait!</i>

06:48.366 --> 06:50.201
Great. Our comm‐link's out!

06:50.952 --> 06:52.370
Aaah!

06:52.370 --> 06:53.288
BOTH: Fury!

07:01.921 --> 07:03.256
‐ You OK?
‐ I'm all right...

07:03.673 --> 07:06.468
But that strike drained
almost all my batteries!

07:11.723 --> 07:13.516
ALL: Woah!

07:19.314 --> 07:22.901
‐ Who is that?
‐ Ms Jones' surprise?

08:05.318 --> 08:07.612
(Gasps) Raijin's like a battery,

08:07.612 --> 08:09.698
and it's recharging
from the antenna!

08:09.698 --> 08:12.617
Give the new guy backup
while I take of the antenna.

08:12.617 --> 08:14.160
My arrows
might short‐circuit it.

08:16.204 --> 08:17.414
No, I've got your back.

08:17.414 --> 08:19.708
I've got this! Focus on Fury.

08:19.708 --> 08:21.584
His Boo energy
is running on empty!

08:21.584 --> 08:23.962
Get it together, Liv,
you can't do everything alone!

08:25.839 --> 08:28.425
Fine. Krush stays with me.
But be careful.

08:31.761 --> 08:32.846
When am I not?

08:47.444 --> 08:48.737
Flexy shield!

08:51.990 --> 08:54.492
Awkward timing, I know,
but who are you?

08:59.914 --> 09:02.417
‐ Who are you exactly?
‐ My name is Glowboo.

09:02.417 --> 09:04.627
Pleased to make
your acquaintance, Andy.

09:04.627 --> 09:07.255
Likewise! Wait,
how do you know my name?

09:07.255 --> 09:09.340
‐ Have we even met?
‐ Affirmative.

09:09.340 --> 09:11.092
We are meeting now.
I am Glowboo.

09:12.218 --> 09:14.054
Yeah, you said that.

09:14.054 --> 09:16.222
But underneath that armour,
who are you?

09:16.222 --> 09:18.683
Like do we have
homeroom together? (Barfs)

09:18.683 --> 09:21.561
‐ You're not Drake, are you?
‐ I am Glowboo.

09:27.400 --> 09:29.736
Spectral bow!

09:44.459 --> 09:46.211
No! It's too strong.

09:46.211 --> 09:48.129
We've gotta find a way
to distract it.

09:48.129 --> 09:50.423
I'm programmed
in the art of diversion.

10:07.941 --> 10:08.608
Teamwork!

10:21.037 --> 10:22.163
Octocat!

10:41.099 --> 10:43.351
(Squeals)

10:55.029 --> 10:57.490
(Cheering)

10:58.324 --> 11:01.119
‐ ALL: Boo‐yah!
‐ Objective neutralised.

11:01.119 --> 11:05.373
Returning to
labro... dot... lab... ratory.

11:05.373 --> 11:07.959
Uh... Ms Jones?

11:13.131 --> 11:16.217
I can't take the suspense,
Miss Jones. Who's the new dude?

11:16.217 --> 11:21.014
He's not a "dude". Glowboo's
an A.I. Artificial intelligence.

11:21.014 --> 11:26.311
‐ So, he's just a robot?
‐ No! It's not a robot, Mike.

11:26.311 --> 11:30.148
Glowboo runs on a computer
algorithm programmed to fulfil

11:30.148 --> 11:32.025
the same mission as you!

11:32.025 --> 11:34.652
But he's still a little glitchy.

11:34.652 --> 11:38.531
Whoa! And you made him
all by yourself, Ms Jones?

11:39.657 --> 11:43.244
Almost. I had a little help
from an old friend of mine.

11:43.703 --> 11:45.622
Cool!
Now that there's four of us,

11:45.622 --> 11:47.707
you won't have to
overbook yourself.

11:47.707 --> 11:50.376
‐ Mike! What about your date?
‐ Charlie texted me.

11:50.376 --> 11:54.380
She's putting it off till
tomorrow 'cause of the weather.

11:54.380 --> 11:56.466
Don't worry.
I'll bring the battery.

11:56.883 --> 11:58.676
Um... actually...

11:58.676 --> 12:01.012
Your dad also forgot
the memory card.

12:01.012 --> 12:03.056
We're postponing the shoot,

12:03.056 --> 12:05.016
so you don't have to come
after all.

12:06.476 --> 12:08.269
That movie's
never gonna get made.

12:31.251 --> 12:33.002
‐ Boo!
‐ Aaah!

12:34.921 --> 12:35.838
Ha, ha!

12:37.215 --> 12:39.008
‐ Boo!
‐ A Ghost?

12:55.024 --> 12:57.360
Hey, Mikey, guess what I've got?

12:57.360 --> 12:59.988
‐ A new MVP jersey?
‐ Er, no...

12:59.988 --> 13:02.156
‐ Your new sneaker line?
‐ No...

13:02.156 --> 13:03.741
Your latest magazine cover?

13:04.659 --> 13:06.786
‐ Ta‐dah!
‐ (Gasps)

13:08.538 --> 13:12.208
The new Clipit smartwatch?
It's not even been released yet!

13:12.208 --> 13:14.377
Let's just say
I pulled some strings,

13:14.377 --> 13:18.673
'cause you're looking at
the new face of Clipit Inc!

13:18.673 --> 13:21.426
You... you got this for me?

13:21.426 --> 13:24.595
Who else? It's the most advanced
smartwatch in the world,

13:24.595 --> 13:26.556
and I know
how much you love gadgets.

13:26.556 --> 13:29.600
And, bonus, it gives out tips
from yours truly!

13:29.600 --> 13:32.228
Now my fans can feel like
they're with me all the time.

13:32.812 --> 13:36.649
<i>Wanna sink some baskets?</i>
<i>Better eat a balanced breakfast</i>

13:36.649 --> 13:40.153
‐ Whoa! Thanks, Dad!
‐ Oh, you're welcome, son.

13:40.153 --> 13:43.239
Who knows? You might
even enjoy my pro tips.

13:52.415 --> 13:54.208
(Snoring)

13:54.208 --> 13:56.002
‐ (Chatter)
‐ Oh, he's so cute!

13:57.670 --> 13:59.589
Someone's looking happy.

13:59.589 --> 14:01.507
Beat your high score
on <i>Spookout?</i>

14:01.507 --> 14:04.135
Maybe it has
something to do with Charlie?

14:04.135 --> 14:06.179
<i>Class is about to start!</i>
<i>But after,</i>

14:06.179 --> 14:08.097
<i>why not shoot some hoops?</i>

14:08.097 --> 14:11.184
No way! Is that the latest ‐‐

14:11.184 --> 14:13.853
OMG! I love it!

14:13.853 --> 14:18.649
The new Michael Collins watch?
So cool!

14:18.649 --> 14:20.860
So what's the biometric
interface like?

14:20.860 --> 14:23.112
Can it really automate
your entire house?

14:23.112 --> 14:26.574
‐ Could I try it on?
‐ Sure thing!

14:27.283 --> 14:30.411
But be careful, my dad
just gave it to me this morning.

14:30.411 --> 14:31.496
I can see why.

14:32.413 --> 14:35.374
I mean, that watch
is made for basketball fans.

14:35.374 --> 14:37.960
He gave it to you 'cause he
hopes his tips will make you

14:37.960 --> 14:40.797
play b‐ball like him.
Fat chance that'll happen!

14:40.797 --> 14:43.466
Thanks for your expert analysis,
Doctor Drake,

14:43.466 --> 14:45.927
but the reason
Mike's dad gave him that watch

14:45.927 --> 14:48.763
‐ is 'cause Mike loves gadgets.
‐ Well, thank you

14:48.763 --> 14:51.057
for being Junior's guard dog!

14:53.476 --> 14:56.229
‐ What?
‐ Boo!

15:06.864 --> 15:08.491
Huh? What's happening?

15:11.327 --> 15:14.122
‐ Ah, Ms Jones! Perfect timing!
‐ <i>Sorry, kids,</i>

15:14.122 --> 15:16.415
<i>my mini nap</i>
<i>turned into a mega one.</i>

15:16.415 --> 15:20.586
Anyhoo, you're dealing with
Petrofear, a level‐five ghost

15:20.586 --> 15:22.839
that petrifies everyone
it passes through.

15:23.256 --> 15:25.258
<i>The crowd is roaring tonight.</i>

15:25.258 --> 15:27.093
My watch!

15:29.220 --> 15:30.263
Cool!

15:30.763 --> 15:32.431
<i>The crowd is roaring tonight.</i>

15:32.431 --> 15:34.851
<i>Have a great game, kiddos!</i>

15:38.354 --> 15:39.063
Oh, no!

15:46.362 --> 15:47.029
That's my watch!

15:50.950 --> 15:54.704
Uh, Ms Jones, is it bad
if Petrofear just merged

15:54.704 --> 15:57.039
‐ with Mike's watch?
‐ Hmm. Let's see...

15:57.039 --> 15:59.876
The power to freeze people
combined with a timepiece

15:59.876 --> 16:02.461
would mean that...
Move it or lose it!

16:02.962 --> 16:05.256
‐ Not without Mike!
‐ Go get him, Andy.

16:05.256 --> 16:06.841
I'll open a portal!

16:06.841 --> 16:07.800
Myst!

16:10.595 --> 16:11.637
Spectral Gate!

16:23.024 --> 16:25.526
Hurry, Glowboo,
they need your help.

16:25.526 --> 16:26.444
Aaah!

16:30.656 --> 16:33.284
Either someone blew
the world's biggest ball

16:33.284 --> 16:34.952
or half the city's trapped.

16:34.952 --> 16:37.413
It's got my watch!
My dad just gave it to me!

16:38.456 --> 16:41.584
We're clear, Ms Jones,
so what's this clock's weakness?

16:41.584 --> 16:43.252
Ms Jones?

16:44.295 --> 16:48.341
‐ Ms Jones isn't answering!
‐ Let's go, Ghost Force!

16:48.841 --> 16:51.135
<i>Ghost Force!</i>
<i>Don't fear the glow!</i>

16:56.224 --> 16:57.266
Fury!

16:58.476 --> 16:59.518
Krush!

17:01.771 --> 17:03.064
Ghost Force!

17:09.737 --> 17:12.740
‐ They didn't have time to flee.
‐ Time... that's it!

17:12.740 --> 17:16.077
Now it's merged with your watch,
not only can it freeze people,

17:16.077 --> 17:18.704
‐ it can freeze time too!
‐ I'll take a wild guess

17:18.704 --> 17:20.706
that's why Ms Jones
isn't answering.

17:20.706 --> 17:23.292
OK, let's think.
The watches' hands were lined up

17:23.292 --> 17:25.044
when it activated its power,

17:25.044 --> 17:26.462
so maybe
if we stopped the hands...

17:29.674 --> 17:32.301
Half‐time show's over,
players get back on the course!

17:36.847 --> 17:38.724
Krush!

17:41.811 --> 17:44.313
‐ Ow!
‐ (Groans)

17:45.481 --> 17:48.067
‐ What are you doing?
‐ Getting my watch back!

17:53.197 --> 17:56.450
‐ I've never seen him like this.
‐ He's making it too personal.

17:56.450 --> 17:58.119
We gotta get him to cool it
or we're doomed!

17:59.620 --> 18:00.997
(Citizens scream)

18:05.543 --> 18:06.711
Fractal Mace!

18:09.338 --> 18:10.881
Aaah!

18:12.425 --> 18:14.594
‐ You OK, dude?
‐ (Groans)

18:14.594 --> 18:16.762
You gotta take a step back.
We'll get your watch back...

18:16.762 --> 18:17.763
together, OK?

18:19.849 --> 18:22.643
‐ OK, what's the plan?
‐ Boo!

18:23.102 --> 18:26.105
We must keep the watch's hands
from lining up!

18:26.105 --> 18:28.482
You pin the ghost down
so I can get to its dial.

18:28.482 --> 18:30.109
Then you blast away, Fury.

18:31.902 --> 18:33.070
(Battle cry)

18:38.826 --> 18:39.785
Destroy.

18:41.662 --> 18:42.288
Spectral Bow!

18:46.834 --> 18:50.630
I've got it in my sights.
I'll glue those hands for good!

18:53.674 --> 18:55.676
Hurry! It's not working!

18:55.676 --> 18:58.971
Follow my tips and you'll be
like one of the Collins' family!

19:02.850 --> 19:04.518
Huh?

19:05.436 --> 19:07.104
Enjoy! (Evil laugh)

19:08.981 --> 19:11.025
Krush!

19:16.072 --> 19:19.992
What's the deal? We were this
close to boo‐capping that ghost!

19:19.992 --> 19:22.536
Sorry, but didn't you hear
what it said?

19:22.536 --> 19:25.164
‐ Drake was right.
‐ Dude, it's not your dad,

19:25.164 --> 19:26.666
it's a watch!

19:26.957 --> 19:28.709
And Drake
is never right about anything.

19:28.709 --> 19:29.710
Tell him, Myst!

19:30.586 --> 19:31.253
(Gasp)

19:32.630 --> 19:34.674
No!

19:34.674 --> 19:37.176
‐ She got caught!
‐ I'm sorry.

19:37.176 --> 19:40.179
This is all my fault.
I messed up bad.

19:40.179 --> 19:42.098
That ghost
is gonna pay big time.

19:42.515 --> 19:43.349
Fury, wait!

19:47.186 --> 19:49.855
Whose team are you on, Krush?

19:49.855 --> 19:53.067
I get that you want payback,
but you gotta take a step back

19:53.067 --> 19:55.569
or we'll make things
even worse!

19:55.569 --> 19:58.197
Please,
don't mess up like I did.

19:58.197 --> 20:01.325
‐ So, what do we do?
‐ We stick to Myst's plan.

20:12.253 --> 20:15.464
Let's hurry before it blasts
another time‐freeze!

20:15.464 --> 20:17.675
I'll pin it down.
You deal with the clock hand!

20:25.641 --> 20:27.685
Look like someone is stuck!
Krush!

20:28.728 --> 20:29.770
(Battle cry)

20:36.402 --> 20:38.612
‐ It's a gear!
‐ And it makes the hand turn!

20:46.287 --> 20:48.080
All right!
Let's block that mechanism!

20:50.708 --> 20:51.709
This is it!

20:52.418 --> 20:53.586
(Straining)

21:05.806 --> 21:06.974
Whoa!

21:13.898 --> 21:15.149
Whoa!

21:15.149 --> 21:16.817
A good rest helps an athlete

21:16.817 --> 21:18.903
bounce back even stronger!

21:19.236 --> 21:21.363
How about you give it a rest?

21:25.075 --> 21:27.203
‐ Krush! The gears!
‐ I'm on it, bro!

21:28.704 --> 21:29.789
Fractal Power!

21:41.050 --> 21:42.051
(Battle cry)

21:46.931 --> 21:48.015
It's nap time!

21:50.684 --> 21:51.769
Dragoyle!

22:10.788 --> 22:11.372
Aaah!

22:23.759 --> 22:24.552
Aw!

22:27.680 --> 22:31.267
Yippee!
My sis is no longer a statue!

22:31.267 --> 22:33.227
(Chuckles)
Good to see you too, Fury.

22:33.227 --> 22:35.229
I'm sorry, Myst.

22:35.229 --> 22:38.858
I should've kept my mind
on the mission instead of...

22:38.858 --> 22:40.484
Drake was spot on.

22:40.484 --> 22:42.820
Dad only gave me this
'cause he wants me to be

22:42.820 --> 22:45.322
‐ a basketball star like him.
‐ Either way,

22:45.322 --> 22:48.325
you'll always be
a star on our team.

22:48.325 --> 22:50.870
Glowboo is ready for action!

22:50.870 --> 22:53.163
<i>All right,</i>
<i>let's get this party started.</i>

22:53.581 --> 22:56.792
Hmm. Not seeing
any boo energy on my map.

22:56.792 --> 22:59.670
Where is
that pesky ghost hiding?

22:59.670 --> 23:04.008
‐ Safe in a boo‐cap?
‐ Mission accomplished, I guess.

23:04.008 --> 23:07.887
(Yawns) Now I can finally
get back to my nap.

23:13.142 --> 23:17.313
Yeah. Mike Collins, my son.
He must have been in class ‐‐

23:17.313 --> 23:19.982
‐ Hi, Dad!
‐ Mike! Are you OK?

23:19.982 --> 23:22.109
I heard you had
another scare at school!

23:22.109 --> 23:27.615
‐ I was so worried.
‐ It's all good, Dad, I'm fine.

23:27.615 --> 23:30.826
Er, Dad?
Your pro tips are great and all,

23:30.826 --> 23:33.954
but, you know,
I'm not really into basketball.

23:33.954 --> 23:36.957
I'm sorry,
those pro tips are for fans.

23:36.957 --> 23:39.293
I won't force you.

23:39.293 --> 23:41.128
I love you
just the way you are, Mickey.

23:42.671 --> 23:45.174
<i>Time to fuel up!</i>
<i>And there's nothing better</i>

23:45.174 --> 23:48.260
<i>than a bowl of healthy cereal</i>
<i>to boost your day!</i>

23:48.260 --> 23:50.512
I couldn't have said it
better myself.
