WEBVTT

00:01.215 --> 00:01.955
u're taking
advantage of me

00:01.975 --> 00:03.141
'cause I'm drunk,
aren't you?

00:03.142 --> 00:04.909
Yeah, I'm a bad girl.

00:05.341 --> 00:07.835
Lucky for both of
us, I don't judge.

00:08.975 --> 00:10.276
It 's not my fault!

00:10.342 --> 00:11.776
Then whose
fault is it?

00:11.843 --> 00:13.342
I told you.
Uncle Charlie.

00:13.409 --> 00:14.909
I thought you lived alone.

00:14.910 --> 00:16.109
I do.

00:16.175 --> 00:18.075
I leave the TV on
to deter criminals.

00:19.496 --> 00:19.676
Charlie,

00:19.743 --> 00:20.974
did you tell Jake
he could use your computer?

00:22.576 --> 00:25.176
Just take what you want
and don't hurt us.

00:25.242 --> 00:26.910
Go ahead and tell
him, Uncle Charlie.

00:26.975 --> 00:28.242
No one's talking to you.

00:28.309 --> 00:30.743
Can you explain to me
why I caught him watching

00:30.810 --> 00:32.843
<i>a Quicktime movie called
Vanessa Does Van Nuys?</i>

00:34.075 --> 00:35.643
Hey, meet Vanessa.

00:36.742 --> 00:38.208
Why don't you hop upstairs?

00:38.209 --> 00:39.542
I'll be right there.

00:39.609 --> 00:40.488
Okay.

00:40.489 --> 00:42.309
Hey, Dad, can we move
to Van Nuys?

00:42.375 --> 00:43.542
No.

00:43.609 --> 00:44.742
Hey,

00:44.809 --> 00:46.108
whose skateboard?
Mine.

00:46.109 --> 00:47.509
Wow. It's really rad.

00:47.576 --> 00:48.676
Thanks.

00:48.742 --> 00:50.309
So's your movie.

00:50.375 --> 00:51.476
Thanks.

00:51.542 --> 00:52.809
We're working on a sequel.

00:52.876 --> 00:55.309
Yeah, I'm gonna do
Woodland Hills next.

00:55.375 --> 00:58.375
Hop, hop,
hop, hop.

00:58.442 --> 01:00.975
Can we move to
Woodland Hills?

01:01.042 --> 01:02.409
Foet Woodland Hills.

01:02.476 --> 01:03.736
What the hell is your skateboard
doing on the stairs?

01:03.737 --> 01:04.494
Excuse me.
We were talking

01:04.769 --> 01:05.935
about the dirty movie
on your computer.

01:05.936 --> 01:08.269
I'm sorry. I forgot
it was on there.

01:08.336 --> 01:09.636
You can't forget things
like that

01:09.703 --> 01:10.936
when you have a child
in the house.

01:11.003 --> 01:11.970
I'm not a child.

01:12.036 --> 01:13.536
And I don't have him.

01:14.569 --> 01:15.636
No one's talking to you,

01:15.703 --> 01:16.703
and that's no excuse.

01:16.770 --> 01:18.003
Look, it's not hardcore.

01:18.070 --> 01:19.269
It's mostly her

01:19.336 --> 01:21.469
and a couple of friends
having a pajama party.

01:21.536 --> 01:23.203
I didn't see pajamas.

01:23.269 --> 01:24.669
Shut up. Go away.

01:27.070 --> 01:29.137
Again, I'm sorry.

01:29.203 --> 01:30.803
Mea culpa.

01:30.870 --> 01:35.003
Now, if you'll excuse me,
mea goin' upstairs.

01:35.070 --> 01:37.003
For a culpa hours.

01:37.070 --> 01:38.903
Hey, Charlie,

01:38.970 --> 01:40.469
who do I work
for-- you

01:40.536 --> 01:42.137
or this fastidious
parasite

01:42.203 --> 01:43.503
you call a brother?

01:43.569 --> 01:46.870
I get the feeling
you want me to say me.

01:47.936 --> 01:49.402
Me. Definitely me.

01:49.469 --> 01:51.170
She works for me.

01:51.237 --> 01:53.170
Well, then, tell her
when something

01:53.237 --> 01:55.503
is on the shopping
list, she should in
fact shop for it.

01:55.569 --> 01:57.536
I'm gonna slug him.
Can I slug him?

01:57.603 --> 02:00.170
Why are you making such
a big deal out of this?
Because it is a big deal.

02:00.237 --> 02:01.603
No, it's not.
The hell it isn't.

02:01.669 --> 02:02.803
Hey, what is going on here?

02:02.870 --> 02:04.336
It's very simple.

02:04.402 --> 02:06.402
I have decided to start drinking
acidophilus milk.

02:07.870 --> 02:11.170
It promotes intestinal flora
which aids in healthy digestion.

02:11.237 --> 02:13.003
Anyway, for
three weeks,

02:13.070 --> 02:15.336
I have been writing it
on the shopping list,

02:15.402 --> 02:18.070
yet Berta insists
on bringing home two percent.

02:18.137 --> 02:19.770
Slug him.

02:22.137 --> 02:24.070
This is my life.

02:24.137 --> 02:26.402
Milk and steboards.

02:31.603 --> 02:35.336
It's a good thing I'm drunk.

02:36.981 --> 02:39.680
www.1000fr.com present

02:39.681 --> 02:41.614
Capture:FRM@ÇòÇò  Sync:FRM@SEED0018

02:43.662 --> 02:46.294
Salted butr. Salted butter.

02:46.295 --> 02:48.629
Extra large eggs.

02:48.696 --> 02:50.162
Extra large eggs.

02:50.228 --> 02:52.629
Acidophilus milk.

02:52.696 --> 02:54.996
Two percent milk,
you whiny pinhead.

02:56.762 --> 02:58.095
Morning.

02:58.162 --> 02:59.462
Hey, how you feeling?

02:59.529 --> 03:01.562
Not too bad really.

03:01.629 --> 03:03.095
That was some fall you took.

03:03.162 --> 03:04.729
Yeah, if I hadn't
been plastered,

03:04.796 --> 03:06.529
it might have killed me.

03:06.596 --> 03:09.562
You'd think the liquor industry
would promote that.

03:09.629 --> 03:11.195
It is a selling point.

03:11.262 --> 03:14.228
Right up there with making
ugly people doable.

03:17.195 --> 03:19.996
Two percent--
the king of milk.

03:20.063 --> 03:22.295
He's got to go, Charlie.

03:22.362 --> 03:24.429
What am I going to do, Berta,
he's my borther.

03:24.495 --> 03:26.429
We could make it look
like an accident.

03:27.996 --> 03:30.862
No, no accidents.

03:30.896 --> 03:34.762
As long as my mother's alive
nothing happens to Fredo.

03:39.696 --> 03:42.429
Hi.

03:44.629 --> 03:48.228
I am sorry to bother you,
I'm just moving in next door.

03:48.295 --> 03:49.429
Really?

03:50.996 --> 03:51.996
You're my new neighbor?

03:53.095 --> 03:55.362
Thank you, God.

03:55.429 --> 03:58.395
Anyway, I just wanted
to stop by and introduce myself.

03:58.462 --> 03:59.462
Danielle Stewart.

03:59.529 --> 04:01.195
Charlie Harper.

04:01.262 --> 04:02.395
Nice to meet you, Danielle.

04:02.462 --> 04:04.295
Come on in.
Oh, thank you.

04:04.362 --> 04:06.662
We'll have a "welcome
to the neighborhood" drink.

04:06.729 --> 04:08.429
It's 9:00 a.m.

04:08.495 --> 04:12.095
You're right, who drinks
at 9:00 a.m.?

04:12.162 --> 04:14.529
I wouldn't mind
a cup of coffee.

04:14.596 --> 04:16.128
Great.

04:16.195 --> 04:18.928
Oh, Berta?
What?!

04:18.995 --> 04:23.162
My faithful housekeeper.

04:23.228 --> 04:24.762
Would you be so kind

04:24.829 --> 04:27.996
as to bring a cup of coffee
for our new neighbor?

04:28.063 --> 04:29.696
Sure.

04:29.762 --> 04:31.462
Luckiest S.O.B. on the planet.

04:31.529 --> 04:34.262
Please.
Thank you.

04:34.329 --> 04:36.796
So, Danielle,
what brings you

04:36.862 --> 04:39.529
to our little
stretch of paradise?

04:39.596 --> 04:43.462
Me? Well, I just got tired
of the cold winters in Chicago.

04:43.529 --> 04:45.128
Well, I don't want
to scare you away,

04:45.195 --> 04:48.362
but winters here the mercury
can dip down to the mid-60s.

04:48.429 --> 04:50.729
Oh, how will I stay warm?

04:50.796 --> 04:52.796
I recommend the buddy system.

04:52.862 --> 04:55.063
You're cute.

04:55.128 --> 04:56.195
I know.

04:57.228 --> 04:58.996
So, what did you do in Chicago?

04:59.063 --> 05:01.195
Well, for the last eight years

05:01.262 --> 05:02.596
I've had a full-time career

05:02.662 --> 05:03.996
trying to spend
my divorce settlement.

05:04.063 --> 05:05.929
Oh, a working woman.

05:07.562 --> 05:09.095
Well, buying a Malibu
beach house

05:09.162 --> 05:10.862
ought to take a big chunk
out of that settlement.

05:10.929 --> 05:12.696
Yeah, you'd think.

05:12.762 --> 05:15.729
Whoa

05:15.796 --> 05:17.862
Anyway, I've had my fun.

05:17.929 --> 05:20.862
I nt to settle down,
get serious with my life.

05:20.929 --> 05:22.262
Oh, yeah, me, too.

05:22.329 --> 05:24.762
No kidding.

05:24.829 --> 05:26.529
So, are you married?

05:26.596 --> 05:29.996
Me? Uh... no.

05:30.063 --> 05:32.696
Are you looking to get married?

05:32.762 --> 05:36.195
Uh... no.

05:36.262 --> 05:39.095
Do you like children?

05:39.162 --> 05:42.195
Uh... no.

05:42.262 --> 05:47.195
So how do you define getting
serious with your life?

05:47.262 --> 05:50.729
Well, I've stopped
drinking in the morning.

05:52.696 --> 05:54.762
Hey, Berta, where's that coffee?

05:54.829 --> 05:56.362
You men are all alike.

05:56.429 --> 05:58.862
Isn't there anyone left who just
wants to get married

05:58.929 --> 06:00.195
anraise a family?

06:00.262 --> 06:02.629
Yeah, but they're all gay.

06:04.195 --> 06:05.862
Here we go.

06:05.929 --> 06:07.729
Thank you.

06:07.796 --> 06:11.329
Oh, you wouldn't happen to have
an acidophilus milk, would you?

06:17.429 --> 06:19.462
Walk me through
this again.

06:19.529 --> 06:21.896
She's beautiful,
rich, divorced

06:21.963 --> 06:25.596
and you want to hand her off
to Zippy the Chimp?

06:27.262 --> 06:29.063
Follow my reasoning here.

06:29.128 --> 06:31.162
This is a woman looking
to settle down.

06:31.228 --> 06:34.562
If I sleep with her,
I'm happy for one night.

06:34.629 --> 06:36.862
But if I teach my brother
to sleep with her,

06:36.929 --> 06:39.596
he falls in love,
asks her to marry him,

06:39.662 --> 06:42.596
moves out and I'm happy
for the rest of my life.

06:42.662 --> 06:44.462
It's a nice plan,
but it'll never happen.

06:44.529 --> 06:45.996
Don't-don't-don't say that.

06:47.162 --> 06:48.862
Unjinx, unjinx, unjinx.

06:48.929 --> 06:50.963
Charlie, she is way
out of his league.

06:51.029 --> 06:54.095
I know that. Everybody
is out of his league.

06:54.162 --> 06:57.029
He doesn't even
have a league.

06:57.095 --> 07:00.329
He's just a kid with
a bat and a ball and
a foball helmet.

07:00.395 --> 07:03.295
But luckily he has me.

07:03.362 --> 07:05.029
Color me dubious.

07:05.095 --> 07:06.662
I'm home.

07:06.729 --> 07:09.195
Come on, I need you
to be with me on this one.

07:09.262 --> 07:10.329
It'll never work.

07:12.629 --> 07:13.629
Voila.

07:13.696 --> 07:14.796
This...

07:14.862 --> 07:17.128
is acidophilus milk.

07:17.195 --> 07:19.462
It's on the shelf below
the two percent

07:19.529 --> 07:21.796
right next to the low-fat
yogurt.

07:21.862 --> 07:25.128
Boy, does your brother have
a girl for you.

07:27.295 --> 07:28.662
What?

07:28.729 --> 07:30.128
She just moved next door.

07:30.195 --> 07:32.462
She's gorgeous,
divorced and loaded.

07:32.529 --> 07:34.529
Mm-hmm. What's wrong with her?

07:34.596 --> 07:36.829
Why does something have
to be wrong with her?

07:36.896 --> 07:40.128
Because there's only two reasons
you ever set me up with a woman.

07:40.195 --> 07:42.662
Either you need somebody to keep
the emotionally disturbed

07:42.729 --> 07:45.162
or cross-eyed or hermaphroditic
best friend busy

07:45.228 --> 07:46.662
while you do
the pretty girl,

07:46.729 --> 07:48.963
or...

07:49.029 --> 07:50.529
okay, I guess there's
just one reason.

07:52.362 --> 07:54.195
There is nothing wrong
with Danielle.

07:54.262 --> 07:56.195
Berta, is she or is
she not gorgeous?

07:56.262 --> 07:57.729
Hey, I'd do her.

08:00.495 --> 08:03.029
If she's so great, why
are you giving her to me?

08:03.095 --> 08:04.329
You want the truth?

08:04.395 --> 08:05.729
It'd be a nice
change of pace.

08:05.796 --> 08:09.929
All right, first of all,

08:09.996 --> 08:12.829
I am sorry about the
hermaphroditic incident.

08:12.896 --> 08:16.996
"I'm sorry" doesn't make up
for leaving me in a hotel room

08:17.063 --> 08:19.228
with a girl who had
a vestigial penis.

08:21.162 --> 08:22.429
I didn't know.

08:22.495 --> 08:24.063
I was as surprised as you were.

08:24.128 --> 08:27.063
Charlie, no one
was as surprised as I was.

08:28.128 --> 08:30.796
But let's move on.

08:30.862 --> 08:33.328
I'm not saying I didn't try
to hit on our new neighbor,

08:33.395 --> 08:34.395
because I did.

08:34.462 --> 08:36.063
And?
I got nowhere.

08:36.128 --> 08:40.294
She saw him for the mindless
meat-seeking missile that he is.

08:40.361 --> 08:44.696
Anyway... I just thought
you two might hit it off.

08:44.762 --> 08:46.796
I'm even making
a little welcome basket

08:46.862 --> 08:48.662
for you to give
to her, see?

08:48.729 --> 08:51.295
So, she's beautiful,
rich and single?

08:51.362 --> 08:52.162
Right.

08:53.862 --> 08:55.063
Why would she want me?

08:55.128 --> 08:56.063
What kind of thing
is that to say?

08:56.128 --> 08:57.395
Why wouldn't she want you?

08:57.462 --> 09:00.128
I'm broke, middle-aged,
twice divorced

09:00.195 --> 09:01.529
sleeping on your
on your hide-a-bed

09:01.596 --> 09:04.128
and sharing custody of a
flatulent, underachieving son.

09:07.577 --> 09:09.063
We're gonna need
a bigger basket.

09:09.128 --> 09:12.963
You're gonna need
chloroform and a rope.

09:17.629 --> 09:19.762
Just remember, the most
important thing

09:19.829 --> 09:21.495
is to project confidence.

09:21.562 --> 09:22.662
Got it.

09:22.729 --> 09:24.929
How do I look?

09:24.996 --> 09:27.662
Just project confidence.

09:30.862 --> 09:32.262
Here, you give her
the welcome basket.

09:32.329 --> 09:34.429
All right, what do I say?

09:34.495 --> 09:35.629
"Welcome."

09:35.696 --> 09:38.295
Good, that's good.

09:38.362 --> 09:40.362
Oh, hi.

09:40.429 --> 09:41.862
Welcome.

09:44.829 --> 09:46.095
Danielle, this is
my brother Alan.

09:46.162 --> 09:47.462
Alan, Danielle.

09:47.529 --> 09:49.862
Alan just wanted to welcome
you to the neighborhood.

09:49.929 --> 09:51.629
Welcome.

09:53.395 --> 09:54.796
Thank you.

09:54.862 --> 09:56.596
You're welcome.

09:56.662 --> 09:58.963
Would you like
to come in?

09:59.029 --> 10:01.329
I don't know, she seems
kind of busy.

10:01.395 --> 10:02.796
Maybe we should
come back...
Go, go, go.

10:02.862 --> 10:05.295
I am sorry that the
place is such a mess.

10:05.362 --> 10:06.896
Don't be silly.

10:06.963 --> 10:09.362
Moving takes time,
right, Alan?

10:09.429 --> 10:10.696
Oh, yes.

10:10.762 --> 10:12.529
I remember the last
time I moved,

10:12.596 --> 10:14.095
it was very time-consuming.

10:14.162 --> 10:15.963
I had to collect boxes
and those packing peanuts,

10:16.029 --> 10:18.128
and boy, those things
get everywhere.

10:18.195 --> 10:20.195
Hey, you know, that's summer
sausage, not salami.

10:20.262 --> 10:21.796
A lot of people
confuse the two.

10:21.862 --> 10:23.696
Interesting.

10:23.762 --> 10:25.996
So, why don't I

10:26.063 --> 10:27.295
open up this wine

10:27.362 --> 10:29.063
and we can toast
to my new home.

10:29.128 --> 10:30.495
Good idea.

10:30.562 --> 10:32.395
None for me. Red wine
makes me gassy.

10:35.729 --> 10:37.429
I'm sorry, I don't have
anything else to offer.

10:37.495 --> 10:38.996
I haven't had time to go
grocery shopping.

10:39.063 --> 10:41.362
Well, then you must
be starving.

10:41.429 --> 10:43.329
Alan, I think we should take
this young lady out to dinner.

10:43.395 --> 10:46.162
But I was planning on warming up
the pot roast from Sunday night.

10:46.228 --> 10:49.262
The pot roast will keep.

10:49.329 --> 10:51.662
I don't know,
it's right on the edge.

10:51.729 --> 10:54.495
Forget the pot roast.

10:54.562 --> 10:56.529
So what do you say?
We could walk up the beach

10:56.596 --> 10:57.896
to Georgio's and grab a bite.

10:57.963 --> 10:59.162
You know, that
sounds wonderful.

10:59.228 --> 11:00.996
Let me just throw on
some clean clothes.

11:01.063 --> 11:02.429
Terrific.

11:02.495 --> 11:04.029
Great. I will be right back.

11:06.796 --> 11:08.963
Huh? Huh?

11:09.029 --> 11:09.862
She's incredible.

11:09.929 --> 11:11.228
Incredible my ass,

11:11.295 --> 11:12.562
she's perfect.

11:12.629 --> 11:15.696
Okay, a couple of pointers.

11:15.762 --> 11:17.128
First off,

11:17.195 --> 11:19.596
you never open with "gassy."

11:19.662 --> 11:21.362
I know that.
It just came out.

11:21.429 --> 11:22.796
It's all right, it's all right.

11:22.862 --> 11:23.896
No, no permanent damage.

11:23.963 --> 11:25.562
Now what's going
to happen here

11:25.629 --> 11:26.996
is I'm going
to bail on dinner

11:27.063 --> 11:28.262
so you two
can be alone.

11:28.329 --> 11:29.429
Really?

11:29.495 --> 11:30.929
'Cause Georgia's
is kind of pricey.

11:30.996 --> 11:33.596
Oh, geez.

11:33.696 --> 11:37.029
Here, tip big.

11:37.128 --> 11:38.562
Don't agonize over the math.

11:38.629 --> 11:40.128
don't agonize.

11:40.195 --> 11:41.862
I just take the sales
tax and double it

11:41.929 --> 11:43.562
which is roughly 15%.

11:43.629 --> 11:45.162
Unless, of course, the service
is less than impeccable

11:45.228 --> 11:46.963
in which case I leave
a flat five dollars.

11:47.029 --> 11:50.896
Alan, it's my money, go crazy.

11:50.963 --> 11:53.896
Fine, 18% it is.

11:53.963 --> 11:57.729
Now, dinner conversation.

11:57.796 --> 11:59.796
Don't talk about your bong
job, your petty problems

11:59.862 --> 12:01.095
or your stupid hobbies.

12:01.162 --> 12:02.729
What else is there?

12:02.796 --> 12:05.662
<i>Her petty problems,
her stupid hobbies.</i>

12:05.729 --> 12:07.796
No woman ever came home
from a date complaining

12:07.862 --> 12:09.495
that all she did
was talk about herself.

12:09.562 --> 12:11.262
Oh, that's good.

12:11.329 --> 12:13.829
And that way,
I remain an enigma.

12:13.896 --> 12:17.495
Yeah, let's call you an enigma.

12:17.562 --> 12:21.128
All righty, do I look okay?

12:21.195 --> 12:23.662
You look beautiful
fantastic.

12:23.729 --> 12:25.495
Right, Alan?

12:25.562 --> 12:27.029
Welcome.

12:29.562 --> 12:30.963
Okay, let's go.

12:37.963 --> 12:39.462
Let me just lock up.

12:41.162 --> 12:42.262
Oh, no...

12:42.329 --> 12:44.629
What do you mean
you have to go?

12:49.063 --> 12:51.996
I mean, uh, what's wrong?

12:54.063 --> 12:56.295
I just remembered I have
some work I need to do.

12:56.362 --> 12:58.495
Oh, no!

12:58.562 --> 12:59.896
Oh, what a shame.

12:59.963 --> 13:01.562
Maybe we should
do this another time.

13:01.629 --> 13:03.562
No, no.

13:03.629 --> 13:05.295
You two go ahead,
enjoy yourselves.
Are you sure?

13:05.362 --> 13:07.295
He's sure. Let's go.
Okay.

13:07.362 --> 13:08.562
See you later,
Charlie.

13:08.629 --> 13:11.896
So, Danielle, you got any
hobbies or problems?

13:16.629 --> 13:19.262
Yes, I know she's hot.

13:23.562 --> 13:26.162
But I'm thinking long-term,
so shut up!

13:32.200 --> 13:33.213
Hey.
Hey.

13:33.687 --> 13:34.201
Where have you been?

13:34.687 --> 13:36.049
Stuck in traffic.

13:36.050 --> 13:37.098
Danielle's coming over
in a few minutes.

13:37.816 --> 13:38.916
Got to shower and change.

13:38.983 --> 13:40.746
Wow, you two
are going out again?

13:40.747 --> 13:41.367
What can I say, Charlie?

13:41.594 --> 13:42.501
The girl digs my mojo.

13:44.072 --> 13:45.227
When did you get mojo?

13:47.136 --> 13:47.499
Scoff if you like,

13:47.807 --> 13:49.227
but that woman is entranced
by the enigma

13:49.974 --> 13:51.441
that is Alan Jerome Harper.

13:53.707 --> 13:56.141
Unbelievable-- your
plan is working.

13:56.208 --> 13:57.444
Told ya.

13:57.445 --> 13:59.112
There must be something wrong
with that girl.

13:59.179 --> 14:01.879
There must be a lot wrong
with that girl.

14:01.946 --> 14:04.313
Well, then it's a match
made in heaven.

14:04.379 --> 14:05.645
There's something wrong with her

14:05.712 --> 14:07.212
and we know there's something
wrong with him.

14:08.612 --> 14:10.512
Yeah, and before you know it,
he'll move out,

14:10.578 --> 14:12.046
they'll get married

14:12.112 --> 14:14.046
and we'll be wondering
what's wrong with their kids.

14:17.112 --> 14:18.179
Hey, Charlie.

14:18.246 --> 14:19.179
Hey, Danielle.
Come on in.

14:19.246 --> 14:20.812
Thank you.
Oh, man.

14:20.879 --> 14:22.979
If the kid
wants to kill me

14:23.046 --> 14:25.346
why doesn't he just cut
my brake line?

14:27.046 --> 14:28.346
Alan's in the shower.

14:28.413 --> 14:29.912
Am I too early?

14:29.979 --> 14:32.445
No, no. No, he's been ving
here for three years.

14:32.512 --> 14:33.912
You want a drink?

14:33.979 --> 14:34.912
No, thank you.

14:34.979 --> 14:36.445
I'm trying to cut down.

14:36.512 --> 14:37.445
Really? Why?

14:37.512 --> 14:39.612
Long story.

14:39.679 --> 14:42.079
Alan takes long showers.

14:42.146 --> 14:44.346
Longer when
he's not dating.

14:44.413 --> 14:46.379
Thank you, Berta.

14:50.279 --> 14:52.313
So, tell me your story.

14:52.379 --> 14:54.112
It's a little embarrassing.

14:54.179 --> 14:56.346
Hey, all the good drinking
stories are.

14:57.413 --> 14:58.478
After a night of partying

14:58.545 --> 14:59.779
at the Pomona State Fair,

14:59.845 --> 15:01.712
I once woke up on tilt-a-whirl
wearing nothing

15:01.779 --> 15:04.079
but a grass skirt
and a tiny sombrero.

15:05.946 --> 15:07.445
No kidding?

15:07.512 --> 15:10.179
I've still got the sombrero.

15:10.246 --> 15:11.946
Okay, your turn.

15:12.012 --> 15:14.779
All right, um...

15:14.845 --> 15:18.979
the reason my marriage
didn't work out...

15:19.046 --> 15:22.146
the reason none of my
relationships work  out,

15:22.212 --> 15:25.679
is because I tend to drink
a little too much

15:25.745 --> 15:28.578
and then do things I regret.

15:28.645 --> 15:30.246
And by "things," you mean...?

15:30.313 --> 15:32.413
Men.

15:32.478 --> 15:34.179
Huh.

15:34.212 --> 15:36.545
And the occasional woman.

15:36.612 --> 15:39.379
Huh.

15:41.545 --> 15:44.979
Well, as stories go,
I'd say this is a good one.

15:45.046 --> 15:47.046
At least yours
doesn't end

15:47.112 --> 15:50.812
with a toothless carnie
offering you a churro.

15:50.879 --> 15:53.912
You know, I had a feeling
you'd understand.

15:55.413 --> 15:57.179
Alan is very sweet,

15:57.246 --> 16:01.779
but the guys I usually go for
are more like... well, you.

16:01.845 --> 16:04.346
Huh.

16:04.413 --> 16:10.379
Anyway, I think I am ready
for a nice normal relationship.

16:10.445 --> 16:13.179
No more getting blitzed
and falling into bed

16:13.246 --> 16:16.079
with the first guy who asks me.

16:16.146 --> 16:18.246
Or a girl.

16:18.313 --> 16:20.712
Or a couple.

16:20.779 --> 16:23.545
Huh.

16:26.779 --> 16:29.679
Huh-huh-huh-huh.

16:31.512 --> 16:33.246
Excuse me.

16:37.812 --> 16:39.612
Okay, new plan.

16:39.679 --> 16:40.745
I'm going to boink Danielle

16:40.812 --> 16:42.379
and Alan's going
to live here forever.

16:42.445 --> 16:44.645
<i>Quelle surprise.</i>

16:52.146 --> 16:53.379
Hello.

16:53.445 --> 16:55.212
It's not your night, Alan.

16:55.279 --> 16:56.679
What?

16:56.745 --> 16:58.346
Danielle, she's not right
for you.

16:58.413 --> 17:00.246
But you said
she was perfect for me.

17:00.313 --> 17:01.845
I was wrong.

17:01.912 --> 17:03.246
She's sick and twisted.

17:03.313 --> 17:04.512
That makes her perfect for me.

17:04.578 --> 17:07.512
I'm sorry, I'm not following.

17:07.578 --> 17:09.912
I was talking
to her out there

17:09.979 --> 17:12.444
and it turns out she's a
boozehound and a sex freak.

17:12.512 --> 17:13.779
What?

17:13.845 --> 17:15.578
I haven't seen that
in her at all.

17:15.645 --> 17:18.413
I mean, I got a od-night kiss,
but she was perfectly sober

17:18.478 --> 17:20.179
and her tongue
did nothing freaky.

17:20.246 --> 17:22.679
That's because she's trying
to hide who she really is.

17:22.744 --> 17:24.179
Who's that?
Me!

17:24.246 --> 17:26.046
She's me, Alan,
top to bottom,

17:26.112 --> 17:29.179
except, you know,
from here to here.

17:29.246 --> 17:31.578
So what is you want me to do,
step aside

17:31.645 --> 17:34.079
so you can lead her back
to a life of sordid degradation?

17:34.146 --> 17:36.545
If you wouldn't mind.

17:36.612 --> 17:37.745
No! No! No!

17:37.812 --> 17:38.845
You gave her to me.

17:38.912 --> 17:40.079
There's no takebacks.

17:40.146 --> 17:41.478
All right, fine.

17:41.545 --> 17:42.812
We'll just let her make
her own decision.

17:42.879 --> 17:44.679
All right, all right,
may the better man win.

17:49.179 --> 17:51.246
You would be rooting
for the shriveled man.

17:55.246 --> 17:56.478
Oh, now, just a little.

17:56.545 --> 17:57.979
You got it.

17:58.046 --> 18:01.512
That is a
beautiful dress.

18:01.578 --> 18:02.645
Whoops.

18:02.712 --> 18:04.645
Ooh.

18:04.712 --> 18:06.112
Sorry.

18:06.179 --> 18:08.478
That's okay.

18:10.179 --> 18:11.112
Mm...

18:11.179 --> 18:12.313
buttery...

18:12.379 --> 18:14.879
with a slight citrus finish.

18:14.946 --> 18:16.946
Hmm.

18:22.487 --> 18:23.084
Ah!

18:26.131 --> 18:27.022
You know wine.

18:29.238 --> 18:30.993
Okay, Danielle,
we'd better get going

18:31.234 --> 18:32.058
if we're gonna make
that reservation.

18:32.746 --> 18:34.247
You're right. Well, thanks
for the wine, Charlie.

18:34.579 --> 18:36.080
Whoa, whoa, what's the hurry?

18:36.147 --> 18:37.380
I was going to make
a pitcher of margaritas.

18:37.447 --> 18:39.213
Ooh, I love margaritas!

18:39.280 --> 18:41.514
Be right back.

18:41.579 --> 18:43.646
Gee, Danielle, do you really
want to sit here

18:43.713 --> 18:44.880
and drink with Charlie?

18:44.946 --> 18:48.347
Oh, yeah, you're right, Alan.

18:48.414 --> 18:49.713
You're a nice guy.

18:49.780 --> 18:51.347
You're good for me.

18:51.414 --> 18:52.980
Okay, Charlie, we're leaving!

18:53.047 --> 18:54.480
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

18:54.546 --> 18:55.980
If you don't have time
for margaritas,

18:56.047 --> 18:57.713
I could mix one up
in your mouth.

18:57.780 --> 18:58.813
Cut it out, Charlie.

18:58.880 --> 19:00.347
I know what you're trying to do?

19:00.414 --> 19:02.347
What are you talking about?
I'm being a good host.

19:02.414 --> 19:03.746
You're taking advantage
of Danielle.

19:03.813 --> 19:05.746
No, no, I respect
Danielle for who she is.

19:05.813 --> 19:07.579
So do I.
No, you respect
Daniel

19:07.646 --> 19:08.946
for who she's
pretending to be.

19:09.013 --> 19:10.239
I don't get you--
why did you bother

19:10.239 --> 19:11.834
putting us together
in the first place?

19:12.484 --> 19:14.741
Because I thought
she was dull and
boring like you.

19:15.193 --> 19:16.330
and I had hoped the two
of you would go

19:16.424 --> 19:17.961
and be dull and boring
at her house!

19:19.123 --> 19:20.689
That was really your plan?
That's insane!

19:21.025 --> 19:23.065
It would have worked if she
wasn't a drunken slut!

19:23.826 --> 19:25.948
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

19:27.660 --> 19:29.679
There is no need
to fight over me.

19:31.213 --> 19:34.000
Alan, you're a sweet gentle guy.

19:34.826 --> 19:36.726
Charlie, you're a pig.

19:38.328 --> 19:39.788
But I find you very attractive.

19:40.912 --> 19:43.644
There's only one
reasonable solution.

19:43.645 --> 19:45.047
I have to do you both.

19:52.429 --> 19:53.387
No crossing swords.

19:55.565 --> 19:56.479
Are you out of your mind?

19:56.536 --> 19:57.753
You're actually
considering this?

19:58.988 --> 19:59.543
Yeah, you're right.

19:59.988 --> 20:01.794
I don't even like eating
dinner next to you.

20:03.522 --> 20:04.888
Thank you

20:04.954 --> 20:06.485
for your generous offer,

20:06.486 --> 20:07.829
but I'm afraid
we must cline.

20:08.653 --> 20:09.734
But mostly he's afraid.

20:10.820 --> 20:13.186
I should have known.

20:13.253 --> 20:14.687
Not a pair between you.

20:15.992 --> 20:18.851
Well, if either of you
change your mind,

20:19.841 --> 20:20.725
you know where to find me.

20:27.941 --> 20:29.374
Okay, you can have her.

20:32.264 --> 20:33.503
"One pound salted butter...

20:35.379 --> 20:37.316
"one dozen extra-large eggs...

20:38.997 --> 20:42.334
one acidophilus milk
for the whiny pinhead."

20:43.750 --> 20:45.555
I thought I was
the only one who
drank this stuff.

20:45.837 --> 20:48.838
What? Are you kidding me?

20:49.341 --> 20:50.165
It's all I drink.

20:51.663 --> 20:54.329
You know,
for the intestinal... fauna.

20:54.962 --> 20:56.630
That all you drink?

20:56.696 --> 20:57.795
Well, I've been known

20:57.862 --> 21:00.263
to add a few fingers of vodka.

21:00.329 --> 21:03.929
Kind of a acidopha-tini.

21:05.296 --> 21:06.396
You're cute.

21:06.463 --> 21:08.429
So I've been told.

21:10.762 --> 21:15.096
I can't. I promised Berta
I'd get the groceries.

21:15.162 --> 21:19.770
All right. You're always right.

21:20.990 --> 21:24.347
