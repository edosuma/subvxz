WEBVTT

00:00.600 --> 00:02.240
previously on ghost whisperer...

00:02.340 --> 00:03.310
we're getting ready.

00:03.410 --> 00:05.710
For what?
- For what's coming.

00:06.420 --> 00:08.720
It's time for you
to know who you are.

00:08.990 --> 00:10.920
And to know who your brother is.

00:11.020 --> 00:12.890
Do you really think it was
your father in the light?

00:12.990 --> 00:15.290
If he's dead, I have to
find out what happened.

00:18.720 --> 00:21.060
You are so over your head.

00:21.210 --> 00:23.010
And I really wouldn't come back.

00:23.110 --> 00:25.410
Ever.

00:28.090 --> 00:30.210
All right, I get it.

00:30.310 --> 00:32.240
I understand.

00:32.340 --> 00:33.870
I'll make dinner.

00:33.970 --> 00:36.860
I'll do the dishes, but, uh,

00:37.190 --> 00:39.490
you just relax. Take it easy.

00:39.890 --> 00:41.970
Look, I offered to help.

00:42.070 --> 00:43.210
Did I miss that?

00:43.310 --> 00:45.900
Look at me. Doing my part,
going to get the door.

00:46.020 --> 00:48.320
Don't hurt your hand on
the doorknob. Take it easy.

00:51.640 --> 00:53.940
Mel, who is it?

01:00.660 --> 01:02.960
What the hell are you doing here?

01:04.340 --> 01:05.319
Wow.

01:05.420 --> 01:07.720
You're angry.

01:09.080 --> 01:10.620
I was there when you got hurt.

01:10.720 --> 01:11.663
You think it's my fault.

01:11.762 --> 01:14.960
You were there, smiling,
and she wasn't just hurt.

01:15.080 --> 01:17.880
For the longest minute
of my life, she was dead.

01:17.990 --> 01:19.280
Yeah.

01:19.380 --> 01:21.450
You know, a part of me didn't
mind seeing you like that.

01:21.550 --> 01:25.680
For a very long time I blamed my entire
family for leaving me locked up in that...

01:26.440 --> 01:28.320
where I grew up.
- Too bad.

01:28.420 --> 01:30.010
Go.
- I'm trying to find dad.

01:30.110 --> 01:31.390
Mine or yours?

01:31.490 --> 01:32.580
Ours.

01:32.680 --> 01:33.940
My father's dead.

01:34.040 --> 01:35.890
Why should that keep either
of us from looking for him?

01:35.990 --> 01:37.710
We both see ghosts.
- Are you done?

01:37.810 --> 01:40.110
Look, I...

01:42.180 --> 01:44.120
I figured you'd still be in denial.

01:44.220 --> 01:47.250
Who would want to admit that their old
man had an extra family on the side?

01:47.750 --> 01:50.050
But are you gonna tell
me you haven't seen him?

01:50.480 --> 01:52.780
He hasn't come to visit
you in your dreams?

01:54.660 --> 01:56.340
Yeah, I thought so.

01:56.440 --> 01:58.620
He's been haunting my dreams, too.

01:58.720 --> 02:00.250
How do you think I found
out you were my sister?

02:00.350 --> 02:02.340
Jim asked you to leave, nicely.

02:02.440 --> 02:04.140
What are you hiding from?

02:04.240 --> 02:05.470
We're both trying to find him.

02:05.570 --> 02:07.120
We both have unfinished
business with him.

02:07.220 --> 02:08.479
We... we should be
working together...

02:08.580 --> 02:10.539
that's enough! Go!

02:10.639 --> 02:12.030
Look.

02:12.130 --> 02:14.430
My mother gave this
to me when I was a kid.

02:14.990 --> 02:17.290
It belonged to my dad.

02:17.450 --> 02:19.770
It'll mean a lot more to
you than it ever did to me.

02:22.770 --> 02:24.670
Patient Personal Property

02:24.770 --> 02:26.540
For you, they were family.

02:26.640 --> 02:29.430
For me, they were just more
people he had to hide me from.

02:30.460 --> 02:32.270
Where was your mother for all this?

02:32.370 --> 02:33.960
She was always close by.

02:34.060 --> 02:36.360
In the next ward
the mental hospital

02:44.040 --> 02:46.860
This is my dad's parents
right after they got married.

02:49.050 --> 02:50.870
And, uh,

02:50.970 --> 02:52.915
my dad told me that
he got these cufflinks

02:53.015 --> 02:55.870
from his aunt and uncle right
after he graduated college.

02:55.980 --> 02:58.660
Honey, you know, gabriel could have
gotten this stuff from anywhere.

02:58.760 --> 03:00.160
I don't trust him either.

03:00.260 --> 03:01.440
But

03:01.540 --> 03:05.370
I just can't shake the feeling that he might
be telling the truth about being my brother.

03:05.620 --> 03:06.570
Why do you think that?

03:06.670 --> 03:08.720
Too many coincidences.

03:08.820 --> 03:12.160
Gabriel showed up right after
that dad told me I had brother.

03:13.440 --> 03:15.740
And let's face it... my dad was

03:16.030 --> 03:18.250
in and out of the house
for a lot of years,

03:18.350 --> 03:21.780
so he could have had kids,
and I wouldn't have known.

03:23.300 --> 03:27.220
Gabriel didn't get his gift from
dad, but he got other things.

03:28.920 --> 03:32.240
Well, he certainly got your dad's
gift for tying you up in knots.

03:36.170 --> 03:38.160
I left the lights on downstairs.
I'm going to turn 'em off.

03:38.260 --> 03:39.940
You need anything? Tea? Water?

03:40.040 --> 03:42.340
No.
- Ok.

03:44.000 --> 03:50.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:24.670 --> 04:26.220
So who do you think
the picture's of?

04:26.320 --> 04:28.220
It's gotta be some
relative of my dad'S.

04:28.320 --> 04:29.600
I mean, all these photos are his.

04:29.700 --> 04:31.240
Well, so gabriel says.

04:31.340 --> 04:34.130
Don't worry. I'm not taking
anything gabriel says on faith.

04:34.250 --> 04:36.458
I just faxed a request
for his medical records to

04:36.557 --> 04:38.698
that mental institution
he said he grew up in.

04:38.797 --> 04:40.190
"Trust, but verify. "

04:40.290 --> 04:42.990
Yeah, sounds good. Only my
motto is slightly different.

04:43.110 --> 04:45.420
Trust, but caffeinate.
What will it be?

04:45.550 --> 04:47.590
The usual. Twice the foam, please.

04:47.690 --> 04:49.990
Ok.

05:12.830 --> 05:15.130
Hello?

05:19.010 --> 05:21.860
Who's there?
- Shh!

05:22.000 --> 05:23.540
Who are you?

05:23.640 --> 05:26.750
Why are you here?
- Please. Quiet.

05:27.580 --> 05:29.880
They're everywhere.

05:31.080 --> 05:32.460
Who?

05:32.560 --> 05:34.860
They told me I was crazy.

05:35.390 --> 05:37.660
They took my baby.

05:37.760 --> 05:39.010
Who are you?

05:39.110 --> 05:41.410
What's your name?

05:46.300 --> 05:48.600
Wait a minute.

05:49.510 --> 05:51.810
Gabriel gave this to me, and he...

05:52.060 --> 05:55.420
he said that his mother was
in the same hospital he was.

05:57.260 --> 05:59.960
You're gabriel's
mother, aren't you?

06:08.760 --> 06:09.970
Help me!

06:10.070 --> 06:12.370
Help me!

06:47.320 --> 06:51.230
First it was ray billings, then there was
the stalker guy I saw get sucked under,

06:51.340 --> 06:53.280
and now this one, gabriel's mother.

06:53.380 --> 06:57.240
Well, if you're asking me to tell you that
there are no dark spirits under grandview,

06:57.350 --> 06:59.810
get comfortable,'cause
it's gonna be a long wait.

06:59.920 --> 07:02.980
You've taken all of the smug
certainty out of being a skeptic.

07:03.120 --> 07:05.120
I'm waiting for you to
tell me how they work.

07:05.220 --> 07:08.950
How can dark spirits trap other
ghosts, and why are they underground?

07:10.270 --> 07:11.150
Well?

07:11.250 --> 07:12.960
Oh, sorry, I thought
we were waiting.

07:13.060 --> 07:16.860
Look, the basic gist of it is that the
dark spirits feed on the darker emotions...

07:16.980 --> 07:19.700
hate, anger, fear, jealousy,
greed, all of that stuff.

07:19.820 --> 07:22.690
And it's very powerful emotion,
so it's hard to break their grip.

07:22.800 --> 07:23.980
Yeah, but not impossible?

07:24.080 --> 07:25.270
No, it's not impossible.

07:25.370 --> 07:27.670
The things that better them are the
same things that better them in life.

07:27.790 --> 07:28.670
All the good stuff...

07:28.770 --> 07:31.470
love, joy, happiness,
forgiveness, melted cheese,

07:34.710 --> 07:36.230
great. Thanks.
- Where are you going?

07:36.330 --> 07:38.740
You're not actually going to go through with this, are you?
- Why wouldn't I?

07:38.860 --> 07:40.150
You're going to take
a tip from this...

07:40.250 --> 07:43.540
this gabriel guy to go find
your untrustworthy deadbeat dad?

07:43.670 --> 07:45.560
Your untrustworthy
deadbeat dead dad?

07:45.660 --> 07:47.070
I'm simply following some leads.

07:47.170 --> 07:48.770
Leads? How? Think about this.

07:48.870 --> 07:51.170
I will. Don't worry.

07:52.960 --> 07:55.260
I'm worried.

08:01.960 --> 08:03.550
Hey.

08:03.650 --> 08:05.950
I got your call. What's up?

08:06.070 --> 08:09.010
I was trying to summon
gabriel's mother...

08:09.130 --> 08:10.940
if that's who she is...

08:11.040 --> 08:13.340
and while I was
waiting, I got this.

08:15.050 --> 08:17.660
It's the treatment records from
gabriel's institution, correct?

08:17.790 --> 08:21.660
Yeah, I asked the doctor for
copies,'cause I wanted to know the truth.

08:23.330 --> 08:25.600
Melinda, look, I'm sorry.

08:25.700 --> 08:28.400
I know that I can't imagine
what this feels like for you,

08:28.530 --> 08:31.410
but there's nothing in here
you didn't already know,

08:31.550 --> 08:34.580
outside of the fact that
he attacked other patients.

08:34.710 --> 08:37.010
He told them he could see ghosts.

08:37.919 --> 08:40.070
They thought he was crazy.

08:40.169 --> 08:42.470
It's why they put him in there.

08:43.460 --> 08:45.240
That could have been me.

08:45.340 --> 08:46.860
No, you have a gift.

08:46.960 --> 08:48.240
He is violent. He is mentally ill.

08:48.340 --> 08:50.640
He's my brother. We have
a lot of the same genes.

08:50.810 --> 08:52.290
You don't know that yet.

08:52.390 --> 08:54.690
Actually, I do.

08:56.250 --> 09:00.830
That's why dr. Lawrence wanted
to see my birth certificate.

09:00.950 --> 09:04.050
He needed proof that I
was family, and he got it.

09:05.090 --> 09:07.390
Gabriel's father was tom gordon.

09:08.650 --> 09:10.950
He's my half brother.

09:12.260 --> 09:14.300
And now you want to save him?

09:14.400 --> 09:15.920
After what he did?

09:16.020 --> 09:18.320
But this is what I do.

09:19.380 --> 09:22.980
I help people fix
their worst mistakes.

09:35.920 --> 09:36.795
Yes, hello.

09:36.895 --> 09:40.450
Um, you have a guest staying with
you under the name gabriel gordon?

09:42.160 --> 09:44.350
Well, could you check?

09:44.450 --> 09:46.750
Sure. Thanks.

09:59.920 --> 10:00.953
Hello?

10:01.052 --> 10:02.473
Mr. Gordon is not answering.

10:02.572 --> 10:03.628
would you like to leave a message?

10:03.727 --> 10:05.220
Yeah!

10:05.319 --> 10:06.743
No.

10:06.842 --> 10:10.300
You know what? I'll... I'll
call back later, thanks.

10:17.310 --> 10:21.058
So this wasn't a haunting,
it was more like a vision?

10:21.157 --> 10:22.303
Uh, yeah.

10:22.402 --> 10:26.018
Sometimes I get them, and
ghosts try to show me things,

10:26.117 --> 10:27.900
and I don't always know why.

10:27.999 --> 10:29.748
But it felt like it was real?

10:29.847 --> 10:30.663
Oh, very.

10:30.762 --> 10:33.213
My heart was still
pounding an hour later.

10:33.312 --> 10:35.528
And did you get a chance
to talk to gabriel about it?

10:35.627 --> 10:36.383
No.

10:36.482 --> 10:38.203
The thing is this... this vision,

10:38.302 --> 10:41.588
it was like... I think it's something
that happened to the ghost...

10:41.687 --> 10:43.333
gabriel's mother...
and I, you know,

10:43.432 --> 10:45.278
at first, I thought it maybe
was the moment that they

10:45.377 --> 10:47.328
took her to the hospital,
but that wasn't right.

10:47.427 --> 10:49.160
I mean, these guys
were rough, you know?

10:49.259 --> 10:50.923
They had a big axe
with blood on it.

10:51.022 --> 10:54.078
Right. Bloody axe doesn't
really say hospital, does it?

10:54.177 --> 10:55.993
I have to find out more
before I talk to gabriel,

10:56.092 --> 11:00.588
which is my roundabout way of
asking you to please watch the store.

11:00.687 --> 11:03.348
Only if you promise to
tell me everything you find.

11:03.447 --> 11:05.715
Deal.
- Ok.

11:07.270 --> 11:08.723
I'm not hurt.

11:08.822 --> 11:09.998
Uh, just so you know.

11:10.097 --> 11:11.238
I'm bigger than that.

11:11.337 --> 11:12.913
Ok. Good.

11:13.012 --> 11:14.343
I'm a talker. I know I talk a lot.

11:14.442 --> 11:17.093
I can't expect people to listen
to every single word I say,

11:17.192 --> 11:19.808
and that's why it didn't surprise
me you didn't listen to me.

11:19.907 --> 11:22.053
What do you mean? I listened.
- You listened?

11:22.152 --> 11:25.728
Then why are we down here with all of
these creepy, spooky ghosts where they live?

11:25.827 --> 11:29.298
Because you had some advice
from your evil twin half brother.

11:29.397 --> 11:30.683
Look, it was your idea.

11:30.782 --> 11:33.783
You said that we needed to
check all the town death records

11:33.882 --> 11:36.848
and that any place where there
was a dark spirit infestation

11:36.947 --> 11:38.510
would probably have
a lot of deaths.

11:38.609 --> 11:40.138
No, no, no. Not...
not a lot of deaths.

11:40.237 --> 11:41.860
A lot and lot of deaths.

11:41.959 --> 11:43.548
And grisly, awful deaths.

11:43.647 --> 11:44.473
And simultaneous.

11:44.572 --> 11:46.303
Like they all happened
at the same time.

11:46.402 --> 11:48.673
Ok, so shouldn't we check
the records like you said?

11:48.772 --> 11:51.008
All right, I don't like
being quoted back to myself.

11:51.107 --> 11:51.893
Especially when I'm right.

11:51.992 --> 11:54.348
While we are looking, why
don't you go that direction,

11:54.447 --> 11:55.628
and I will go this way?

11:55.727 --> 11:57.980
Ok.

11:58.080 --> 12:00.380
Let's see.

12:00.900 --> 12:02.638
I've been looking for
you. Where have you been?

12:02.737 --> 12:03.783
Quiet.

12:03.882 --> 12:05.153
They can hear you.

12:05.252 --> 12:06.223
Please tell me what happened.

12:06.322 --> 12:08.518
I can help you cross
over into the light.

12:08.617 --> 12:09.883
Oh, no, no.

12:09.982 --> 12:11.068
I... I can't do that.

12:11.167 --> 12:12.093
I can'T.

12:12.192 --> 12:14.518
I... I don't deserve to be free.

12:14.617 --> 12:16.773
Why?

12:16.872 --> 12:18.953
I lost my baby.

12:19.052 --> 12:21.063
It's all my fault.

12:21.162 --> 12:23.778
What do you mean? What happened?

12:23.877 --> 12:26.458
They all died because of me.

12:26.557 --> 12:28.820
Who?

12:28.919 --> 12:31.113
Give up.

12:31.212 --> 12:32.978
You won't find what
you're looking for.

12:33.077 --> 12:34.608
And what am I looking for?

12:34.707 --> 12:35.553
It doesn't matter.

12:35.652 --> 12:37.518
Whatever it is, you won't find it.

12:37.617 --> 12:38.773
That's my job.

12:38.872 --> 12:43.460
I make sure what's
buried stays that way.

12:53.040 --> 12:54.768
Oh, my god.

12:54.867 --> 12:56.850
What are these?

12:56.949 --> 12:59.217
These are teeth.

13:02.690 --> 13:04.003
"Clay 48"?What does that mean?

13:04.102 --> 13:08.868
I don't know, but whoever these belonged
to is going to have a hard time eating beef.

13:08.967 --> 13:10.858
She said they all
died because of me.

13:10.957 --> 13:12.050
Who?
- The ghost.

13:12.149 --> 13:13.266
Gabriel's mother.

13:13.365 --> 13:14.413
You think she... what?

13:14.512 --> 13:15.528
She killed all these people?

13:15.627 --> 13:16.493
I don't know.

13:16.592 --> 13:19.890
But what does she have to
do with all these deaths?

13:22.730 --> 13:24.823
You gave those things to find dad.

13:24.922 --> 13:28.628
Is it just about dad, or are you
looking for someone else, too?

13:28.727 --> 13:30.263
Like who?

13:30.362 --> 13:32.003
I spoke to your mother's ghost.

13:32.102 --> 13:34.668
She said,"they all
died because of me. "

13:34.767 --> 13:35.443
What does it mean?

13:35.542 --> 13:38.168
I don't know who you're talking
to, but that wasn't my mother.

13:38.267 --> 13:38.763
How do you know?

13:38.862 --> 13:40.698
To start with, my
mother's no ghost.

13:40.797 --> 13:42.043
She's alive. And insane.

13:42.142 --> 13:44.733
And living in some halfway
house in crested butte.

13:44.832 --> 13:47.353
Well, then, who is the
ghost that you led me to?

13:47.452 --> 13:49.543
I mean, I have followed all
the leads in the envelope,

13:49.642 --> 13:51.663
and that's the only ghost
I can make contact with.

13:51.762 --> 13:56.430
If there were any ghosts attached to dad's
stuff, it was something you did, not me.

13:57.410 --> 13:59.678
So who's this ghost you met?

13:59.777 --> 14:01.138
You know, I'll call you.

14:01.237 --> 14:04.360
If I find anything.

14:07.260 --> 14:08.618
Of course his mother
wasn't the ghost.

14:08.717 --> 14:09.818
I could have told you that.

14:09.917 --> 14:10.403
Then why didn't you?

14:10.502 --> 14:13.628
Ok, technically, I could not have told
you that until about a minute or two ago,

14:13.727 --> 14:14.263
but I would have told you.

14:14.362 --> 14:16.838
See, I have a friend that
teaches forensic pathology,

14:16.937 --> 14:18.173
and he's been looking
at these teeth.

14:18.272 --> 14:20.603
Did you know that these
teeth are over 150 years old?

14:20.702 --> 14:22.713
So then how are those teeth
connected to this ghost?

14:22.812 --> 14:24.793
He's going to run some
tests on the smoke stains

14:24.892 --> 14:26.803
and caraway seeds that are
stuck inside these teeth.

14:26.902 --> 14:29.808
But I'm pretty sure the message
is going to remain clear.

14:29.907 --> 14:31.783
Never underestimate
the power of floss.

14:31.882 --> 14:35.428
So then the mystery is, is who is this
ghost, and why did she lead us to that box?

14:35.527 --> 14:38.948
The real mystery is, who is this ghost,
and why did she lead us to that box?

14:39.047 --> 14:40.635
That is what I just said.

14:40.734 --> 14:42.253
Well, what did you mean?

14:42.352 --> 14:45.678
I mean, are you suggesting that possibly
all these deaths happened somewhere else,

14:45.777 --> 14:48.253
and that's why there's no recorded
history of them here in grandview?

14:48.352 --> 14:51.338
No, because ghosts usually have some
sort of attachment to where they died,

14:51.437 --> 14:55.158
which is weird, because these
ghosts seem to be stuck underground.

14:55.257 --> 15:00.350
Well, then, the real mystery
is, is, uh, is what you said.

15:16.530 --> 15:19.840
What is it about this thing?

15:22.420 --> 15:25.643
You remember it, don't you?

15:25.742 --> 15:29.840
People did terrible
things to each other.

15:32.390 --> 15:34.208
Do you remember your name?

15:34.307 --> 15:36.023
He called me tessa once.

15:36.122 --> 15:38.843
Tell me how all those people died.

15:38.942 --> 15:41.588
You made it sound
like it was your fault.

15:41.687 --> 15:43.413
I don't know anymore.

15:43.512 --> 15:45.518
So many ghosts tell the story.

15:45.617 --> 15:47.588
They each tell it differently.

15:47.687 --> 15:49.150
What's your version?

15:49.249 --> 15:50.716
I tried to warn them.

15:50.815 --> 15:52.213
But they wouldn't listen.

15:52.312 --> 15:55.348
What did you try
to warn them about?

15:55.447 --> 15:57.123
I saw a ghost.

15:57.222 --> 15:59.553
He was from weston.

15:59.652 --> 16:02.448
I gave them the
warning that he gave me.

16:02.547 --> 16:03.968
I don't understand.

16:04.067 --> 16:05.983
Were you dead?

16:06.082 --> 16:08.863
I was as alive as you.

16:08.962 --> 16:12.878
So you saw ghosts
when you were alive?

16:12.977 --> 16:16.058
Why are you so surprised?

16:16.157 --> 16:18.233
You see me.

16:18.332 --> 16:23.678
I guess maybe there were more of us
doing what we do than I ever knew.

16:23.777 --> 16:25.870
Until they find out.

16:25.969 --> 16:27.993
Then they kill us.

16:28.092 --> 16:30.503
Is that why they killed you?

16:30.602 --> 16:32.978
That doesn't matter anymore.

16:33.077 --> 16:35.250
All that matters is...

16:35.350 --> 16:36.888
Tessa, wait. Where are you going?

16:36.987 --> 16:38.123
I... I can help you.

16:38.222 --> 16:40.828
Find out what happened
to my baby, please.

16:40.927 --> 16:42.548
That's all that matters.

16:42.647 --> 16:45.050
Tessa, wait!

16:46.720 --> 16:49.088
I thought you said you
were going to the archives?

16:49.187 --> 16:50.453
I am.

16:50.552 --> 16:52.053
This isn't the archives.

16:52.152 --> 16:53.583
There's no dust, no cobwebs.

16:53.682 --> 16:55.778
Tessa said that she was
warned by a ghost from weston.

16:55.877 --> 16:57.098
These are the weston archives.

16:57.197 --> 16:58.433
They're all online.

16:58.532 --> 17:01.130
You're kidding me. Let me see.

17:01.680 --> 17:04.089
And here come my search results.

17:04.369 --> 17:05.272
Wait.

17:05.372 --> 17:06.532
Listen to this.

17:06.632 --> 17:10.818
"Rumors from grandview said residents
there became sick "with a strange fever.

17:10.916 --> 17:14.617
"The unknown disease killed dozens,"but
not before making them insane.

17:14.717 --> 17:18.050
The fever caused many to murder
their friends and family. "

17:21.920 --> 17:23.433
"The worst rumor
told of a preacher "

17:23.531 --> 17:27.420
who slaughtered his flock after
locking them up in his church. "

17:27.900 --> 17:28.863
What church is that?

17:28.962 --> 17:30.943
St. Agnes church on clay street.

17:31.042 --> 17:32.638
Well, that's why the
box said "clay 48."

17:32.737 --> 17:34.263
It was the name of the
street and the year.

17:34.362 --> 17:37.518
Yeah, but the weird thing is I've never
heard of a st. Agnes church or a clay street.

17:37.617 --> 17:38.323
That's what's weird to you?

17:38.422 --> 17:40.008
The slaughtered flock... nothing?

17:40.107 --> 17:41.223
All right, listen to this.

17:41.322 --> 17:43.683
"Weston doctor eustace
green wrote in his diary

17:43.782 --> 17:46.383
"that he treated patients with
symptoms "like those in grandview.

17:46.482 --> 17:49.048
"He mentions a theory that it
might be linked "to tainted bread.

17:49.147 --> 17:52.808
"No traces of the bread
survived to confirm his theory. "

17:52.907 --> 17:54.528
Ergot poisoning. Of
course. That's it.

17:54.627 --> 17:55.613
What's it?
- Ergot!

17:55.712 --> 18:00.158
It's a toxin that's found in a
fungus that grows on grain, even rye.

18:00.257 --> 18:01.918
The symptoms are everything
they're explaining here.

18:02.017 --> 18:02.983
Seizures, vomiting.

18:03.082 --> 18:04.703
The psychosis. Even gangrene.

18:04.802 --> 18:07.318
That explains why
they lost their minds.

18:07.417 --> 18:09.863
I think I found the
ghost who warned tessa.

18:09.962 --> 18:12.698
"Soon after writing this diary
entry,"dr. Greene died of exposure. "

18:12.797 --> 18:14.738
He was traveling through a
blizzard towards grandview,

18:14.837 --> 18:17.683
presumably to treat
victims there. "

18:17.782 --> 18:21.570
Tessa said that she was
warned by a ghost from weston.

18:23.840 --> 18:25.800
Hey.

18:25.900 --> 18:27.483
my girl.

18:27.582 --> 18:29.143
You look tired.

18:29.242 --> 18:31.583
Delia doesn't come
for another hour.

18:31.682 --> 18:34.598
You could take a nap
before dinner if you want.

18:34.697 --> 18:37.543
If I lay down, I will
sleep until next thursday.

18:37.642 --> 18:40.288
Any luck confirming some of that
stuff you found in the weston archive?

18:40.387 --> 18:43.508
I spent all afternoon
there, and I finally found

18:43.607 --> 18:45.173
one box of grandview papers from,

18:45.272 --> 18:49.438
like,1848, and not one of them mentioned
the deaths from the weston records.

18:49.537 --> 18:50.833
It's bizarre.

18:50.932 --> 18:52.188
Did gabriel ever call me back?

18:52.287 --> 18:54.555
No. Did you expect him to?

18:55.940 --> 18:58.623
Then I asked delia to check
her real estate sources.

18:58.722 --> 19:01.898
You know, hoping that maybe clay
street had been renamed or something.

19:01.997 --> 19:03.903
Came up dry there, too.

19:04.002 --> 19:06.408
You know, it's like the
whole thing was so shameful,

19:06.507 --> 19:09.170
the town just decided to bury it.

19:10.730 --> 19:12.803
Bury it?

19:12.902 --> 19:14.223
What do you mean?

19:14.322 --> 19:15.608
Well, you know.

19:15.707 --> 19:16.473
Hide it.

19:16.572 --> 19:19.420
Sweep it under the rug.
Put something heavy on it.

19:19.700 --> 19:22.438
I wonder if that's why they're
all trapped underground?

19:22.537 --> 19:25.658
It's maybe the why,
the who, or what?

19:25.757 --> 19:26.723
No. Wait a minute.

19:26.822 --> 19:27.848
Hey, delia's going
to be here at 8:00.

19:27.947 --> 19:29.093
No, no, no. Just keep cooking.

19:29.192 --> 19:30.663
Seriously. I'll be
back in. Like, an hour.

19:30.762 --> 19:34.720
I just... I want to find
out what else they buried.

19:39.910 --> 19:42.210
Hello?

19:44.220 --> 19:47.050
Tessa, are you here?

20:00.430 --> 20:03.520
St. Agnes church.

20:15.030 --> 20:18.350
Clay street, it's underneath.

20:28.860 --> 20:32.700
St. Agnes church, clay street.

22:35.210 --> 22:37.580
Sorry, jim.

24:14.470 --> 24:17.050
Oh, my god.

24:58.720 --> 25:01.020
Clay street.

25:02.420 --> 25:04.463
You startled me.

25:04.562 --> 25:06.830
He surprised us, too.

25:09.960 --> 25:12.920
"Us"?

25:14.960 --> 25:16.958
You lived here once, didn't you?

25:17.057 --> 25:18.313
And died here.

25:18.412 --> 25:21.373
Is that why you're
all trapped underneath?

25:21.472 --> 25:24.018
Because you died here,
and then you were buried?

25:24.117 --> 25:27.648
They didn't like the
story our bones told,

25:27.747 --> 25:31.260
so they pretended we never lived.

25:32.250 --> 25:36.180
Built your town
right on top of ours.

25:36.880 --> 25:40.360
If you hear anything from her,
please, give us a call, ok?

25:42.100 --> 25:43.988
Mel!

25:44.087 --> 25:45.908
Melinda!

25:46.007 --> 25:46.683
Oh.

25:46.782 --> 25:47.583
It's you.

25:47.682 --> 25:49.118
Is it that painful to see me?

25:49.217 --> 25:50.123
No, no, no. I'm sorry.

25:50.222 --> 25:51.768
We just thought you
might be melinda.

25:51.867 --> 25:52.903
Where is melinda actually?

25:53.002 --> 25:55.998
Because some test results came
back, confirming a theory, we...

25:56.097 --> 25:57.943
where is melinda?

25:58.042 --> 25:59.898
Look, I don't know.
It could be nothing.

25:59.997 --> 26:01.818
But she said she'd
be back in an hour.

26:01.917 --> 26:02.473
When?

26:02.572 --> 26:03.923
3 hours ago.

26:04.022 --> 26:04.868
This isn't like her. Ok?

26:04.967 --> 26:05.743
She doesn't disappear.

26:05.842 --> 26:07.283
She doesn't leave
her cell phone off.

26:07.382 --> 26:08.663
What was the last thing she said?

26:08.762 --> 26:10.008
We were talking about the ghost.

26:10.107 --> 26:11.163
Tessa.
- Right.

26:11.262 --> 26:12.753
And I said, you
know, something about

26:12.852 --> 26:15.638
how I felt like the whole town had
buried what had happened to her.

26:15.737 --> 26:18.488
She pops up and says,"I'm going to
go find out what else they buried. "

26:18.587 --> 26:21.240
The archives.

26:21.720 --> 26:25.448
Tessa, I know that you
don't remember it well,

26:25.547 --> 26:28.153
but I need you to try.

26:28.252 --> 26:31.368
I need you to make peace with
what happened and then move on.

26:31.467 --> 26:32.603
It won't work.

26:32.702 --> 26:35.878
There's too many others who
won't ever make peace with me.

26:35.977 --> 26:37.433
Ok, so talk to them.

26:37.532 --> 26:38.618
We'll make them understand.

26:38.717 --> 26:39.493
No.

26:39.592 --> 26:40.503
I can'T.

26:40.602 --> 26:41.443
Why not?

26:41.542 --> 26:43.748
They're not out here.

26:43.847 --> 26:46.115
They're in there.

26:50.170 --> 26:54.280
Tessa, please tell me what
happened in that church.

26:56.870 --> 26:59.223
Half the town was already sick.

26:59.322 --> 27:02.128
Brother davis, he thought he was
locking them in to protect them

27:02.227 --> 27:05.673
from the sickness and
everyone out here who had it.

27:05.772 --> 27:09.918
But all they brought in to
feed them was water and bread.

27:10.017 --> 27:14.283
Later, after they'd
all lost their minds,

27:14.382 --> 27:17.968
brother davis decided he
needed to destroy the evil.

27:18.067 --> 27:19.323
So he started the fire.

27:19.422 --> 27:21.513
With everyone locked inside.

27:21.612 --> 27:25.120
He killed them all... even himself.

27:27.870 --> 27:31.110
So what happened to
you and your baby?

27:32.530 --> 27:35.848
When I told them the fever
was coming before it came,

27:35.947 --> 27:39.828
and that I'd heard the
news from a ghost...

27:39.927 --> 27:43.058
what else could they think?

27:43.157 --> 27:44.983
I must be a witch.

27:45.082 --> 27:46.453
Yeah, but you knew it wasn't true.

27:46.552 --> 27:49.298
All I know is they locked
me up in that church,

27:49.397 --> 27:50.873
dragged me away from my baby,

27:50.972 --> 27:54.230
said I could spend the rest of my
days with the ones I had killed.

27:56.050 --> 27:58.990
No!

28:04.000 --> 28:06.433
It wasn't your fault.

28:06.532 --> 28:09.488
There was no magic that did this.

28:09.587 --> 28:11.073
It was just a disease.

28:11.172 --> 28:15.808
No, they... they've told me
again and again and again...

28:15.907 --> 28:17.633
well, they were wrong.

28:17.732 --> 28:21.238
You risked your life to give them
that warning, and you were right.

28:21.337 --> 28:24.580
Weren't you?

28:26.230 --> 28:27.988
I wish someone could tell them.

28:28.087 --> 28:29.953
I will.

28:30.052 --> 28:32.068
And you'll tell them with me.

28:32.167 --> 28:33.123
No!

28:33.222 --> 28:34.783
Wait, please! We can't!

28:34.882 --> 28:37.960
You don't know what lives in there.

28:38.650 --> 28:40.548
No, please! We can't go in!

28:40.647 --> 28:41.913
We have to.

28:42.012 --> 28:45.160
It's the only way
you can cross over.

28:58.710 --> 29:01.320
Hey, you guys. Look at this.

29:02.330 --> 29:03.938
That's melinda's handwriting.

29:04.037 --> 29:05.543
What does this mean?"S. A"?

29:05.642 --> 29:08.688
St. Agnes church. That's
what she was looking for.

29:08.787 --> 29:11.168
It's a map. That's
town square, right?

29:11.267 --> 29:13.535
Yeah.

29:13.890 --> 29:16.190
Hey...

29:18.710 --> 29:21.693
this is recent.

29:21.792 --> 29:22.928
Who would move these bookcases?

29:23.027 --> 29:25.710
Come on, give me a hand.

29:30.780 --> 29:33.320
One of them must have
gone through here.

29:40.330 --> 29:42.600
Damn it.

29:42.700 --> 29:43.953
Damn it.

29:44.052 --> 29:45.568
There's no way we
can go through there.

29:45.667 --> 29:47.333
Oh, my god. Jim!

29:47.432 --> 29:50.870
Wait, if melinda went in there...

29:52.530 --> 29:54.758
No, she's alive.

29:54.857 --> 29:56.573
I'd know.

29:56.672 --> 29:57.983
What is youe emergency?

29:58.082 --> 30:00.350
Yeah, I need driscoll
country rescue and recovery.

30:00.800 --> 30:02.783
Yes. I'll hold.

30:02.882 --> 30:04.873
Guys, it's melinda
we're talking about.

30:04.972 --> 30:09.220
If she wasn't alive, she'd
find a way to tell us.

30:12.780 --> 30:14.483
It won't work.

30:14.582 --> 30:17.830
What's done can't be undone.

30:59.430 --> 31:03.810
Why'd she do this to us?

31:04.750 --> 31:06.983
They're both witches.

31:07.082 --> 31:09.350
Witches did this to us.

31:11.940 --> 31:14.480
Witches...

31:21.190 --> 31:22.483
look, this is a map.

31:22.582 --> 31:24.448
I think it shows the
way she was headed.

31:24.547 --> 31:26.380
Sir, you want to find
your wife. I understand.

31:26.479 --> 31:28.243
But I've been in the
tunnels a hundred times.

31:28.342 --> 31:31.350
There are no branches
where this says there are.

31:31.570 --> 31:34.478
This is going to sound a little
strange, ok, but these lines...

31:34.577 --> 31:36.968
I don't think these are
tunnels that you've been in.

31:37.067 --> 31:37.793
They're something else, ok?

31:37.892 --> 31:41.258
They're what's leftover
of old roads, alleyways...

31:41.357 --> 31:44.688
they're what's leftover of
another town, underground.

31:44.787 --> 31:46.268
Another town underground?

31:46.367 --> 31:47.558
Actually, this town.

31:47.657 --> 31:49.153
The way it was.

31:49.252 --> 31:50.383
About 200 years ago.

31:50.482 --> 31:53.868
Actually, there's lots of cities that
have been built on top of entire towns.

31:53.967 --> 31:55.365
I mean, edinburgh, scotland...

31:55.464 --> 31:56.793
they covered the royal mile.

31:56.892 --> 32:00.348
Look, I'm sorry, but I've got to
go where I know the tunnels are.

32:00.447 --> 32:01.760
Right.

32:01.859 --> 32:04.127
Excuse me.

32:08.440 --> 32:10.760
Wait a minute.

32:15.970 --> 32:18.270
Come with me.

32:22.240 --> 32:24.558
I know you're all angry.

32:24.657 --> 32:27.620
I can feel that.

32:27.719 --> 32:30.613
And I understand.

32:30.712 --> 32:33.853
You died too soon and too horribly.

32:33.952 --> 32:36.518
Your hearts tell you there
has to be a reason for that.

32:36.617 --> 32:38.333
And there is.

32:38.432 --> 32:40.858
But it's not what you think.

32:40.957 --> 32:43.348
No evil killed you. Or witches.

32:43.447 --> 32:45.538
It was just a disease.

32:45.637 --> 32:46.675
What disease?

32:46.774 --> 32:47.743
Think back.

32:47.842 --> 32:50.868
The food brought into the
church... it was bread, wasn't it?

32:50.967 --> 32:53.098
Bread that was made of rye.

32:53.197 --> 32:54.428
How do you know that?

32:54.527 --> 32:56.253
They found some.

32:56.352 --> 33:00.458
After you died. And
that bread carried...

33:00.557 --> 33:02.003
a disease.

33:02.102 --> 33:05.248
And made people so ill
that they lost their minds.

33:05.347 --> 33:08.440
Is it true?

33:08.750 --> 33:12.398
A doctor was coming to warn
you, but he didn't make it.

33:12.497 --> 33:15.298
So he asked tessa to
give you the message.

33:15.397 --> 33:17.023
It couldn't be true. Could it?

33:17.122 --> 33:19.618
That's the only reason
that she knew before you.

33:19.717 --> 33:21.180
Could be true.

33:21.279 --> 33:22.708
It could be true.

33:22.807 --> 33:25.123
Lies.

33:25.222 --> 33:27.328
Lies from another witch.

33:27.427 --> 33:30.660
It's him.

33:31.980 --> 33:33.363
Melinda, go!

33:33.462 --> 33:35.818
What about the other
ghosts? They need help, too.

33:35.917 --> 33:38.388
You're not powerful enough. Run!

33:38.487 --> 33:41.430
Powerful...

33:42.310 --> 33:45.920
finally.

34:20.710 --> 34:22.918
my fault, it was my fault.

34:23.016 --> 34:25.284
Help!

34:26.540 --> 34:28.308
Don't waste your breath.

34:28.407 --> 34:30.243
You'll need it.

34:30.342 --> 34:32.908
You're not the first to come
down here and look for us.

34:33.007 --> 34:35.257
Others have come and
been trapped, too.

34:35.357 --> 34:36.533
I... I've watched them panic.

34:36.632 --> 34:40.197
Help comes, but they don't
last until it gets there.

34:40.297 --> 34:42.908
Is help coming for me?

34:43.007 --> 34:45.550
Yes.

34:47.130 --> 34:50.380
But it's too far away.

34:53.020 --> 34:55.163
Ok.

34:55.262 --> 34:59.100
Tessa, I have to cross
you over into the light.

34:59.440 --> 35:01.178
I told you...

35:01.277 --> 35:02.653
I can'T.

35:02.752 --> 35:04.428
What's done can't be undone.

35:04.527 --> 35:06.168
Yeah, but you didn't do anything.

35:06.267 --> 35:07.913
Yes, I did.

35:08.012 --> 35:10.653
I abandoned my baby.

35:10.752 --> 35:14.788
If I hadn't carried that message,
I never would have lost her.

35:14.887 --> 35:18.520
It's all my fault
she was left alone.

35:19.550 --> 35:22.053
You can't keep blaming yourself.

35:22.152 --> 35:24.553
You were just trying to save lives.

35:24.652 --> 35:27.768
That's a subject you
know something about.

35:27.867 --> 35:30.590
Don't you, melinda?

35:33.860 --> 35:36.590
Dad?

35:41.730 --> 35:45.563
Ok, if this is city hall,
and that's the old theater,

35:45.662 --> 35:50.550
then the closest building to the
alley that fed into church street is...

35:51.380 --> 35:52.603
right there.

35:52.702 --> 35:54.103
What a coincidence.

35:54.202 --> 35:57.618
I don't know about you, but I'm beginning
to think that there's no such thing.

35:57.717 --> 35:59.673
How did find me?

35:59.772 --> 36:01.188
Where have you been? Did you die?

36:01.287 --> 36:02.613
I don't understand.

36:02.712 --> 36:03.703
Melinda, there's no time.

36:03.802 --> 36:07.093
I can't be here for
long, and neither can you.

36:07.192 --> 36:10.448
I can't believe I let
myself walk into this.

36:10.547 --> 36:12.108
I... everybody told
me to stay away.

36:12.207 --> 36:13.958
You didn't walk into anything.

36:14.057 --> 36:15.650
You were led here.

36:15.749 --> 36:17.308
By who? Gabriel?

36:17.407 --> 36:18.975
By me.

36:19.074 --> 36:20.573
Why?

36:20.672 --> 36:22.303
Did you want me to die?

36:22.402 --> 36:24.193
You needed to know the truth.

36:24.292 --> 36:26.013
Why couldn't you just tell me?

36:26.112 --> 36:29.158
Would you have believed
any of this if I'd told you?

36:29.257 --> 36:30.860
Would you believe anything I sd?

36:30.959 --> 36:32.528
Ai I don't know if believe you now.

36:32.627 --> 36:35.223
I mean, what's going on?

36:35.322 --> 36:37.448
What is it that I need to know?

36:37.547 --> 36:38.423
Everything.

36:38.522 --> 36:41.018
The truth about
grandview, why you're here,

36:41.117 --> 36:42.373
the dangers you're facing,

36:42.472 --> 36:46.368
but also, the power that you
have and what you can do with it.

36:46.467 --> 36:49.380
Open your locket.

36:56.460 --> 36:58.993
My baby.

36:59.092 --> 37:00.503
I don't know what
your mother told you,

37:00.602 --> 37:04.178
but the real reason
why we split was... you.

37:04.277 --> 37:06.265
It was nothing you did.

37:06.364 --> 37:08.283
It's what you could do.

37:08.382 --> 37:12.448
I wanted you to revel in
your gift, not hide it.

37:12.547 --> 37:13.663
I don't understand.

37:13.762 --> 37:16.558
The locket is not from my side of
the family. It's from your mother'S.

37:16.657 --> 37:19.010
She wanted to bury
that part of your past,

37:19.109 --> 37:21.428
so she packed up the
photos and the keepsakes,

37:21.527 --> 37:22.980
and she threw them away.

37:23.079 --> 37:24.463
I found them and saved them.

37:24.562 --> 37:27.758
How do I know that
any of this is true?

37:27.857 --> 37:31.020
Tell melinda your baby's name.

37:32.730 --> 37:36.400
Julia lee lucas.

37:36.620 --> 37:39.640
Wait. I know that name.

37:40.250 --> 37:44.530
That's my great-great
grandmother's name.

37:45.800 --> 37:47.743
Your daughter...

37:47.842 --> 37:51.218
is my grandmother's grandmother?

37:51.317 --> 37:53.678
You're descended...

37:53.777 --> 37:57.230
from me?

37:57.960 --> 38:00.043
You see?

38:00.142 --> 38:03.003
Your baby was ok.

38:03.102 --> 38:07.018
I know because otherwise,
I wouldn't have this...

38:07.117 --> 38:10.240
beautiful daughter.

38:12.520 --> 38:14.643
I'm sorry. I'd like...

38:14.742 --> 38:18.378
to stay and help you
if I could, but...

38:18.477 --> 38:19.343
I have to leave now.

38:19.442 --> 38:20.758
But I have so many questions.

38:20.857 --> 38:21.583
I know.

38:21.682 --> 38:23.318
I'll come back and find you.

38:23.417 --> 38:25.685
Soon.

38:35.580 --> 38:36.253
Jim, have some water.

38:36.352 --> 38:37.898
You haven't taken a
break in over an hour.

38:37.997 --> 38:40.988
No. I'm almost
through. I can feel it.

38:41.087 --> 38:42.925
Thank you. Is there any ice?

38:43.024 --> 38:44.930
This is room temperature.

38:45.030 --> 38:46.743
Damn it!

38:46.842 --> 38:49.428
She was right. It's just
like on melinda's map.

38:49.527 --> 38:50.548
There's some kind
of tunnel in here.

38:50.647 --> 38:52.443
Come on. Back up. Look out.

38:52.542 --> 38:55.188
I'm going to make this
big enough to get through.

38:55.287 --> 38:57.095
The air's getting thin.

38:57.194 --> 38:58.933
Your friends are close.

38:59.032 --> 39:01.588
But they won't know where to
look if you don't make noise.

39:01.687 --> 39:02.763
Noise?

39:02.862 --> 39:04.023
Use your voice.

39:04.122 --> 39:06.218
You have to call out now.

39:06.317 --> 39:07.100
Quickly!

39:07.199 --> 39:08.226
Hello?

39:08.325 --> 39:09.283
Louder!

39:09.382 --> 39:11.168
They won't hear you like that.

39:11.267 --> 39:13.003
I can'T.

39:13.102 --> 39:15.068
There's no air. I just...

39:15.167 --> 39:17.480
can'T.

39:22.190 --> 39:23.113
Which way should we go?

39:23.212 --> 39:26.878
We're already way past where
the church is supposed to be.

39:26.977 --> 39:29.343
You have to try.

39:29.442 --> 39:33.380
I can't lose my baby again.

39:38.220 --> 39:39.733
Your baby?

39:39.832 --> 39:42.298
Don't you see?

39:42.397 --> 39:45.250
You came for me.

39:45.349 --> 39:48.200
You have to live.

39:49.430 --> 39:51.973
Hello?

39:52.072 --> 39:53.548
Can you hear me?

39:53.647 --> 39:55.940
That's good.

39:56.039 --> 39:58.330
Now louder.

39:58.550 --> 40:01.340
Hello?

40:03.960 --> 40:06.723
Did you feel that breeze? That way.

40:06.822 --> 40:10.248
I can't believe I'm about to
say this, but I feel something.

40:10.347 --> 40:11.843
Ok. It's not possible. I...

40:11.942 --> 40:13.493
look, no, hey.
Maybe it is possible.

40:13.592 --> 40:15.108
Maybe it's that ghost.
Her name is tessa.

40:15.207 --> 40:17.740
Melinda's that way.

40:18.590 --> 40:20.148
guys, I think we
should go that way.

40:20.247 --> 40:21.338
Wait, wait. I hear something.

40:21.437 --> 40:22.163
Down here!

40:22.262 --> 40:23.428
Can you hear that?

40:23.527 --> 40:26.253
Hello?

40:26.352 --> 40:28.203
I'm in here!

40:28.302 --> 40:30.680
That's melinda. Come on. Come on.

40:34.080 --> 40:36.573
I'm down here!

40:36.672 --> 40:39.640
Move back. They're almost here.

40:40.590 --> 40:41.853
Mel!

40:41.952 --> 40:44.220
Jim!

40:49.680 --> 40:52.930
I'm coming. almost there

41:07.030 --> 41:09.318
It's ok. Come here.

41:09.417 --> 41:11.685
That's ok.

41:16.100 --> 41:19.710
You know you're 12 hours late
for dinner. That is so not ok.

41:20.920 --> 41:23.900
I... I am so sorry.

41:24.150 --> 41:27.390
I am so sorry.

41:28.160 --> 41:32.100
As long as you're ok,
babe, nothing else matters.

41:43.220 --> 41:45.948
Your town is so beautiful.

41:46.047 --> 41:48.483
It's your town, too.

41:48.582 --> 41:51.478
I'm glad I was the one
that got to show it to you.

41:51.577 --> 41:54.138
I wish the other spirits
beneath could see.

41:54.237 --> 41:56.243
They will.

41:56.342 --> 41:59.360
I'll find a way.

41:59.790 --> 42:03.293
There it is.

42:03.392 --> 42:06.378
Hey, it's so bright.

42:06.477 --> 42:08.745
So beautiful.

42:09.270 --> 42:12.860
I... I didn't think I'd ever...
- you deserve it.

42:13.280 --> 42:15.428
Especially for what
you've done for me.

42:15.527 --> 42:18.265
And for this town.

42:18.364 --> 42:21.100
It's what we do.

42:21.450 --> 42:23.328
Yeah, I guess that's true.

42:23.427 --> 42:25.323
You and I, we...

42:25.422 --> 42:30.028
we've seen so many people
go into the light, but...

42:30.127 --> 42:32.988
until the end, we
never see it ourselves.

42:33.087 --> 42:34.853
That's ok.

42:34.952 --> 42:37.220
I think I'll wait.

42:37.540 --> 42:39.263
That's right.

42:39.362 --> 42:40.983
You wait.

42:41.082 --> 42:45.330
Wait a long, long time.

42:47.740 --> 42:51.720
Be careful, melinda.

42:52.930 --> 42:56.090
I will.

43:15.320 --> 43:19.398
next time I tell you to
help me with your sister...

43:19.497 --> 43:21.968
try not to kill her instead?

43:22.067 --> 43:24.760
So you saw her?

43:25.890 --> 43:29.370
Can't keep this up for much longer.

43:31.210 --> 43:33.543
I won't have to.

43:33.642 --> 43:35.403
It's already in motion.

43:35.502 --> 43:36.863
Soon she'll be with us.

43:36.962 --> 43:38.228
And what if she won't?

43:38.327 --> 43:39.523
She's a smart girl.

43:39.622 --> 43:42.493
She'll make the right choice.

43:42.592 --> 43:45.460
Because if she doesn't...

43:46.305 --> 43:52.827
