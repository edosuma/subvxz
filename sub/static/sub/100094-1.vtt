I know you haven't seen me,
but I'm here every week.

11:02.828 --> 11:05.164
[man] All I see
is you loitering on my stoop.

11:05.706 --> 11:08.417
My foot is off of the stoop.
I'm not loitering.

11:08.501 --> 11:10.336
Pat!

11:10.419 --> 11:12.463
Hey! There you are!

11:12.546 --> 11:14.173
[Pat grunts, laughs]

11:14.256 --> 11:15.299
How's it going, buddy?

11:15.383 --> 11:16.634
He your boyfriend?

11:17.426 --> 11:18.386
What? No.

11:18.469 --> 11:20.680
[man] Can't have people
hanging around out here,

11:20.763 --> 11:22.056
leaving their trash everywhere.

11:22.473 --> 11:23.724
What'd you do to your hair?

11:24.767 --> 11:25.643
Excuse me, George.

11:26.477 --> 11:27.520
Did I know you were coming?

11:27.603 --> 11:29.438
Dion invited me for dinner,

11:29.897 --> 11:31.982
but you don't have to, like, feed me.

11:32.066 --> 11:33.484
I could take him out for pizza.

11:33.567 --> 11:35.695
-No, Dion's not going anywhere.
-Mom!

11:35.778 --> 11:37.947
-You ran away from school.
-He what?

11:38.030 --> 11:41.200
Go upstairs, straight to your room.
No video games till I'm not mad anymore.

11:41.283 --> 11:42.368
-But--
-Now.

11:44.495 --> 11:46.414
[George] Don't make noise in the hall.

11:49.625 --> 11:52.837
There's a raccoon living in the dumpster.

11:53.170 --> 11:54.171
Mm-hmm.

11:55.881 --> 11:57.383
-[stammers] Can we...?
-Yeah.

11:57.466 --> 11:58.592
Just, uh... [mumbles]

11:59.301 --> 12:00.136
[George] Mm-hmm.

12:14.400 --> 12:15.276
Sorry for the...

12:16.235 --> 12:17.695
I wasn't expecting company.

12:18.821 --> 12:19.697
Oh, well...

12:19.989 --> 12:21.699
I mean, I don't--
I don't need to be company.

12:21.782 --> 12:23.617

-It's almost 6:00...
-[Nicole] Mm-hmm.

12:37.715 --> 12:39.467
...and the boy does need to eat.

12:39.550 --> 12:42.303
And I know he ran away from school,
and as his godfather,

12:42.386 --> 12:44.513
I will talk to him very sternly
about that...

12:44.597 --> 12:46.098
uh, over a pizza.

12:47.600 --> 12:48.517
Hey, Nicole.

12:50.227 --> 12:51.103
I...

12:51.187 --> 12:54.273
I found these amazing new comics
at Comic-Con,

12:54.356 --> 12:56.108
and I really want to show them off.

12:56.192 --> 12:58.569
I could go over them with you,
but I don't think you'd...

12:58.652 --> 12:59.528
Like, this one.

12:59.612 --> 13:02.615
It's a pretty cool backstory I think
you would particularly connect with,

13:02.698 --> 13:04.700
but I think Dion would like it more.

13:04.784 --> 13:07.203
And I didn't run away,
so please don't punish me.

13:07.578 --> 13:10.080
Let me get him out of your hair
for an hour.

13:10.790 --> 13:12.208
No soda, no dessert.

13:12.625 --> 13:15.044
Okay. That's a good...
Yeah, I think you're right.

13:15.127 --> 13:18.464
Dion! I got you an hour.
Let's go before your mom changes her mind.

13:19.006 --> 13:19.882

13:19.965 --> 13:21.258

Yes, of course he did,

18:45.666 --> 18:47.876
because he was better than me
at everything.

18:47.960 --> 18:50.462
And then, later,
he talked me into joining BIONA with him.

He was already a... a storm chaser,
and, uh...

18:53.882 --> 18:55.843

18:59.054 --> 19:00.806

19:25.122 --> 19:26.957

19:37.009 --> 19:40.345

about your father, is that he...

19:41.263 --> 19:42.723
loved to fish.

19:43.265 --> 19:45.434
His dad taught him
when he was a little kid,

19:45.517 --> 19:48.729
and, you know,
his dad built the lake cabin himself.

19:48.812 --> 19:51.815
So we would go up there,
fish anytime we got the chance.

19:51.899 --> 19:54.318
We had this rule
where we only ate what we caught,

19:54.401 --> 19:57.196
so if the fish weren't biting,
we didn't eat.

19:57.279 --> 19:58.655
Did he catch a lot of fish?

19:58.947 --> 20:01.158
Your dad? Yeah, tons.

20:01.241 --> 20:04.119

Can I see your phone?

34:07.628 --> 34:09.756
I want to look up Chris's YouTube channel.

34:10.339 --> 34:11.799
No, I didn't bring my phone out here.

34:11.883 --> 34:14.635
[groans] I need to like
Chris's YouTube account.

34:15.845 --> 34:17.764
-This never ends, you know?
-What?

34:18.931 --> 34:19.974
Wanting to fit in.

34:21.309 --> 34:26.105
And trying to figure out what to do, say,
wear, buy. I mean...

34:27.106 --> 34:27.982
What do you like?

34:30.401 --> 34:31.694
Comic books and Legos.

34:31.778 --> 34:33.362
Chris doesn't like comic books.

34:33.446 --> 34:34.864
But you do, right?

34:37.325 --> 34:39.160
If you show people the real you,

34:39.243 --> 34:42.663
you will not only make friends,
but you will make the right friends.

34:42.747 --> 34:43.748
[bird cawing]

34:48.294 --> 34:50.004
All right,
who's ready for macs and cheese?

34:50.088 --> 34:52.799
We only eat what we catch.
We gotta keep fishing.

34:52.882 --> 34:55.051
That's not gonna happen. Let go.

34:56.969 --> 34:57.970
I'm not giving up.

35:02.183 --> 35:03.392
Hey, Di. Stop that.

35:04.644 --> 35:06.813
-Hey, stop that, okay? That's cheating.
-[whooshing]

35:07.939 --> 35:08.773
What?

35:21.702 --> 35:22.703
[Nicole] Oh, no.

35:23.079 --> 35:24.038
No, no, no, no, no.

35:24.205 --> 35:26.624
Dion, they can't breathe up there.
They need water.

35:26.707 --> 35:27.667
[grunting]

35:27.750 --> 35:29.752
[water gurgling]

35:36.592 --> 35:39.595
[Nicole] Okay.
That's not exactly what I meant.

35:47.395 --> 35:48.896
[Nicole] Okay. Um...

35:49.522 --> 35:50.439
Uh, j--

35:51.566 --> 35:52.942
Just put... just put them down.

35:59.532 --> 36:01.659
Okay, good. Good job, buddy.

36:05.413 --> 36:07.540
Dion, are you doing something
to the trees?

36:08.082 --> 36:09.584
[Dion] Not on purpose.

36:11.794 --> 36:14.422
[Nicole] No, no, no, no.
Honey, let go of the trees.

36:14.589 --> 36:16.090
You're pulling the trees down.

36:16.841 --> 36:17.800
Di?

36:18.176 --> 36:20.178
[Dion] Abracadabra!

36:20.261 --> 36:21.554
[crashing]

36:22.638 --> 36:24.307
[Nicole] No, no, no,
that's making it worse.

36:24.390 --> 36:26.100
Just try to calm down, honey!

36:26.726 --> 36:30.855
-[Dion] I don't like this. It's scary.
-[screams] I know! I'm scared too, okay?

36:30.938 --> 36:31.772
[screams]

36:32.815 --> 36:34.358
-Try and focus!
-[screaming]

36:34.442 --> 36:36.360
[Dion] Abracadabra!

36:36.736 --> 36:38.154
[both scream]

36:38.237 --> 36:40.489
-[Dion] I can't!
-I don't think you're trying!

36:40.573 --> 36:42.283
[Dion] Abracadabra!

36:42.366 --> 36:43.784
[Nicole screams]

36:44.076 --> 36:45.453
-[Nicole screams]
-[Dion grunts]

36:46.412 --> 36:47.246
[cries out]

36:48.664 --> 36:49.498
Di?

36:51.834 --> 36:52.752
[Nicole, muffled] Dion?

36:53.544 --> 36:54.587
Dion!

37:08.684 --> 37:09.769
[gasps]

37:11.187 --> 37:12.438

37:15.858 --> 37:17.109

38:23.551 --> 38:25.136
[Nicole] <i>He saved a stranger...</i>

38:25.970 --> 38:27.596

-[Dion] <i>Mom!</i>

38:35.146 --> 38:36.272
[thunder crashes]

38:40.526 --> 38:42.528
Honey, what are you doing out of bed?

38:42.611 --> 38:44.530
Looking at the rain people.

38:44.739 --> 38:45.656
Looking at what?

38:50.286 --> 38:52.371
Baby, we really need to get back inside.

38:58.336 --> 38:59.545
[voices whispering]

39:09.055 --> 39:10.723
[voices continue whispering]

39:12.224 --> 39:13.267
[breathes heavily]

39:17.688 --> 39:19.815
[male voice] They don't know it,
but we got to do it.

39:22.443 --> 39:24.445
[Mark] Nicole! You shouldn't be here.

39:25.071 --> 39:26.364
-[Mark] Go.
-[Nicole gasps]

39:29.992 --> 39:31.702
You gotta take Dion and leave.

39:31.786 --> 39:32.745
[breathes heavily]

39:35.331 --> 39:37.792
You don't understand.
We don't have a lot of time.

39:39.126 --> 39:40.127
It's dangerous.

39:41.128 --> 39:42.088
Dad?

39:43.047 --> 39:43.881
You gotta--

39:50.012 --> 39:51.180
Was that my dad?

39:51.931 --> 39:52.973
Where'd he go?
