-All right?

Oh la la. Aren't we the hot shit now, hey?

Hmm.

I'll tell you what.
Why don't you draft it up,

08:25.087 --> 08:27.131
and maybe I'll send it
if you don't fuck it up.

08:27.673 --> 08:28.841
Yes, Chef. Thank you, Chef.

08:45.733 --> 08:47.109
[in Spanish] What a great idea, mijo.

08:47.860 --> 08:48.861
Just leave me there inside...

08:49.028 --> 08:51.197
so I can burn down with it all.

for Miramar Salvaje.

-[Casimiro] Chavala.
-You'd win an Emmy.

09:05.795 --> 09:09.840
Pops, look, a 50-cent increase on burritos
isn't gonna do shit.

09:09.924 --> 09:11.384
But if you keep letting me make changes,

09:11.467 --> 09:12.593
-I promise, I will--
-What do you think, mijo?

09:13.010 --> 09:13.844
What do you think?

Uh...

Well, have you asked my dad for help?

Your dad? If he's not helping you,
do you think he's going to help me?

Yeah, you're right.

Do you have a moment
to look over the books?

No, Pop, I gotta write this letter.

-Geo, for sure.

09:48.254 --> 09:49.755
What? Come on, man.

09:49.922 --> 09:51.090
Geo's family! What's wrong with you?

09:51.173 --> 09:52.675
-Chris, just stay out of this, please.
-[Chris] Oh, yeah.

09:52.758 --> 09:54.677
It's not like I have a business degree
or anything, so...

09:55.136 --> 09:55.970
-What do I know?
-[Casimiro] Okay.

09:56.053 --> 09:57.638
Okay, I'll think about it.

09:57.722 --> 09:58.556
I'll think about it.

09:59.181 --> 10:02.059
Pop,  I'll take a pay cut, all right?
I'll quit. I'll quit.

10:02.143 --> 10:05.313
-Come on, man. That's not necessary.
-And Lidia? Lidia. Lidia.

10:07.273 --> 10:08.399
Whatever you need, Pop.

10:09.191 --> 10:10.151
Family comes first.

10:13.696 --> 10:15.489
OK, well, this is getting depressing.

10:16.282 --> 10:17.491
OK, ah, I'm going to work.

10:17.742 --> 10:18.701
Anyone for miches?

10:21.579 --> 10:22.413
Yeah.

10:22.955 --> 10:24.206
Salud!

10:24.540 --> 10:25.416
Salud!

10:27.335 --> 10:29.003
-Mm!
-[grunts]

10:29.086 --> 10:31.881
-[Ana scoffs]
-[blows a raspberry] That is... stringent.

10:31.964 --> 10:33.633
Mm. Do you have any añejo back there?

10:33.716 --> 10:35.426
-[tsks] Come on.
-[Erik] Hey,

10:36.052 --> 10:38.220
-don't complain about free alcohol, bro.
-[Ana] Mm-hmm.

10:38.346 --> 10:41.182
Ana's risking her one steady job,
so we have drunk selfies on the ground.

10:42.058 --> 10:42.892
[Erik] I can't wait

10:42.975 --> 10:44.810
to shoot the shit with you
in the welfare line, cuz.

10:44.894 --> 10:45.936
[chuckles]

10:46.020 --> 10:46.937
I heard about the shop.

10:47.563 --> 10:48.397
Sorry.

10:49.231 --> 10:50.900
-You should hit me up though. We can--
-[exhale]

10:50.983 --> 10:52.693
Come on, I'm just fucking around,
we're good.

10:53.444 --> 10:54.362
Pops and I are golden.

10:55.655 --> 10:56.822
I got our business covered.

10:58.157 --> 10:59.367
All right, come on.

10:59.450 --> 11:00.326
Come on.

11:00.534 --> 11:01.410
-It's our turn.
-Nope.

11:01.494 --> 11:03.120
-No. No, I don't like...
-[Yessika] Yes!

11:03.204 --> 11:04.622
I don't like chunti Mexican music.

11:04.705 --> 11:06.499
-It's all the same.
-Get over yourself!

11:06.582 --> 11:08.292
-[Chris] It ends with "tan tan!"
-[Ana] Come on.

11:08.709 --> 11:10.711
-[Yessika laughs]
-[Ana sings in Spanish]

11:11.337 --> 11:13.881
[all singing in Spanish
on mariachi instrumental]

11:36.404 --> 11:37.279
Hey, beautiful.

11:38.739 --> 11:39.573
Hi.

11:40.032 --> 11:41.367
So, I'll pick you up Friday night?

11:42.118 --> 11:44.245
We'll get upstairs and we'll get
some of that sexy shrimp, hm?

11:44.328 --> 11:45.621
Get something yummy in that tum?

11:45.788 --> 11:46.706
Nope. I'm good.

11:47.081 --> 11:47.915
What's wrong?

11:48.249 --> 11:49.250
Are you under the weather?

11:49.667 --> 11:50.751
Working overtime? What's up?

11:51.335 --> 11:53.379
-Look, Erik, can we not do this?
-Do what?

11:54.964 --> 11:55.798
Hey,

11:56.298 --> 11:58.217
is this about the money I owe you? Huh?

11:58.384 --> 12:00.136
I just need a little time, all right?

12:00.636 --> 12:01.846
You remember we broke up right?

12:01.929 --> 12:03.723
Yeah. So Friday?

12:03.806 --> 12:06.142
No, for real.
Like really broke up this time.

12:06.225 --> 12:08.185
Don't worry about it.
I'm gonna pay you back.

12:08.811 --> 12:09.979
I'm a man of my word.

12:10.604 --> 12:13.566
Look, you can Snapchat these excuses.

12:13.649 --> 12:16.610
DM, text it, shit, TikTok it.
I don't care.

12:16.819 --> 12:18.070
Pop may have to close the shop.

12:20.239 --> 12:21.866
Yeah, of course.

12:23.534 --> 12:24.368
Wait, what?

12:25.453 --> 12:27.288
Nothing. Erik, is that all?

12:28.247 --> 12:29.415
What do you mean "of course"?

12:29.999 --> 12:30.833
Nothing.

12:31.125 --> 12:32.543
[indistinct chattering]

12:33.377 --> 12:35.880
Lidia, I'm doing everything I can
to take care of my baby.

12:35.963 --> 12:37.590
I'm not your baby, Erik.

12:38.090 --> 12:38.966
I meant the baby.

12:42.219 --> 12:43.345
[big exhale]

12:44.472 --> 12:45.306
I got to go.

12:46.432 --> 12:47.641
You should go take care of Pop.

12:48.225 --> 12:49.059
He needs you.

12:49.351 --> 12:51.353
["Adiós, Adiós" by El Poder playing]

12:57.193 --> 13:00.946
[Erik, chuckling] Hey. Tamales. Tamales.

13:01.113 --> 13:03.657
But in Idaho they call me by my full name.

13:03.741 --> 13:05.618
I was like that's not necessary,
but it's OK.

13:05.701 --> 13:06.619
Shh.

13:08.162 --> 13:09.121
[Ana] Mm.

13:09.288 --> 13:10.164
Slow down.

13:10.247 --> 13:11.540
What? They don't have tamales in Idaho?

13:11.624 --> 13:12.958
Mm-mm. No.

13:13.042 --> 13:14.251
They got cows and potatoes.

13:14.335 --> 13:15.836
No real Mexican anything.

13:15.920 --> 13:18.172
-Yeah, present company included.
-[Yessika, laughs]

13:18.255 --> 13:20.841
Are you sure that tamale's not going
to offend your classy taste buds?

13:20.925 --> 13:24.720
My buds? Oh, they've got a wide spectrum
of appreciation.

13:24.804 --> 13:28.182
That's why I can do Costco dogs
and gourmet tamales.

13:28.265 --> 13:29.225
There ain't no gourmet tamale food.

13:29.350 --> 13:30.976
-They're not, but they should be.
-[Erik and Ana, laugh]

13:31.477 --> 13:32.311
That's a good idea.

13:32.436 --> 13:34.271
-It could bring us some new clientele.
-Sure.

13:34.563 --> 13:36.857
'Cause white folks love
dropping money on authenticity.

13:37.316 --> 13:39.193
Tamales, serapes.

13:39.276 --> 13:41.946
-Nopales, Huaraches.
-Our hoods.

13:42.154 --> 13:44.740
Come on. Can't they just love something
'cause they think it's cool?

13:44.824 --> 13:47.618
Honey, they may love all our shit,
but they don't love us.

13:47.701 --> 13:50.120
Even whitewash motherfuckers
like Pop's landlord

13:50.204 --> 13:52.998
can do a Mexican hat dance,
all while kicking walk Pop to the curb.

13:53.123 --> 13:56.669
OK. All I'm saying is that maybe
if you fancied things up a bit,

13:56.752 --> 13:58.462
you could compete
with the changing economy.

13:58.546 --> 13:59.421
[Ana] OK, OK.

13:59.505 --> 14:02.925
Mr. Wall Street,
where's your two-piece suit, huh?

14:03.008 --> 14:04.552
It's in Idaho with my potatoes.

14:04.635 --> 14:06.554
I'm sorry, haven't you been gone
for a decade?

14:07.137 --> 14:08.764
-Why are you weighing in?
-You know what?

14:08.848 --> 14:10.391
I'm gonna take all your fucking advice.

14:11.058 --> 14:11.892
Right?

14:13.352 --> 14:15.938
I'm gonna get it, and I'm gonna put it
in my pocket for later.

14:16.021 --> 14:16.897
[Ana and Yessika laugh]

14:16.981 --> 14:18.941
Save it for later,
but you're gonna use it at least.

14:19.650 --> 14:20.901
-To wipe my ass.
-To wipe your ass?

14:20.985 --> 14:22.528
Got it. You know what? Whatever.

14:22.695 --> 14:24.321
At least, I'll have a job
six months from now.

14:24.446 --> 14:26.448
[rap music playing]

14:37.001 --> 14:39.003
Shush! Shit.

14:41.422 --> 14:42.590

15:54.620 --> 15:55.537
Mm?

15:56.538 --> 15:58.123
This is really hard for me to say, man.

16:01.335 --> 16:02.169
You know what? Hey.

16:03.837 --> 16:04.672
For the kids, huh?

16:04.755 --> 16:05.923
[in Spanish] Oh wow!

16:06.006 --> 16:09.051
[laughs] I'll tell them
Uncle Erik sent it to them!

16:09.468 --> 16:11.804
-Nah, we're not really related, man.
-Hombre,

16:11.887 --> 16:13.430
I mean they love el tío Erik.

16:13.514 --> 16:14.348
They always say,

16:14.431 --> 16:17.810
"Daddy! When I grow up
I want to be like Uncle Erik!"

16:17.893 --> 16:19.853
Will you just let me get this out, please.

16:20.604 --> 16:21.563
What?

16:23.899 --> 16:25.275
You know time's are rough, compa.

16:25.359 --> 16:26.402
I know.

16:28.237 --> 16:29.655
Geo, we're letting you go.

16:29.863 --> 16:30.948
Go where?

16:35.244 --> 16:36.078
Wait,

16:36.704 --> 16:37.538
am I fired?

16:37.913 --> 16:38.747
I'm sorry, Geo, it's just--

16:39.289 --> 16:40.749
there aren't enough cuts to make, bro.

16:40.833 --> 16:42.209
-Something's gotta give.
-Hombre,

16:42.292 --> 16:43.377
cut my hours,

16:43.585 --> 16:45.504
pero to fire me ¿así nomás?.

16:45.796 --> 16:48.590
No, and I told you last week
that I have gout in my big toe.

16:48.674 --> 16:49.675
Have you seen me limp?

16:49.758 --> 16:50.718
Yes, I know. I've seen you limp and--

16:50.801 --> 16:52.261
And I got a baby on the way, cabrón.

16:52.344 --> 16:54.138
Hey, we all got a family to take care of.

16:56.765 --> 16:57.766
You're fired, Geo.

17:07.609 --> 17:08.736
[in pain] Ay-ay-ay-ay.

17:08.819 --> 17:10.320
[sucks in breath] Ay-ay.

17:14.199 --> 17:15.242
I'm really sorry, Geo.

17:23.083 --> 17:24.501
[Ana] All right, go wash up, baby girl.

17:24.752 --> 17:26.795
Chris will make a snack
and you can do your homework.

17:27.171 --> 17:30.090
Don't be putting no smoked Gouda
in my grilled cheese, white boy.

17:30.382 --> 17:32.051
Hey, don't knock it 'til you try it.

17:32.134 --> 17:33.927
[Ana] Hey, I won't be
at the gallery too long.

17:34.178 --> 17:35.888
Ah, thank you so much for watching her.

17:35.971 --> 17:36.930
Yeah, sure thing.

17:37.014 --> 17:38.557
Hey, I'm working on my letter of rec.

17:39.016 --> 17:40.726
If I say "Chris's culinary skills

17:40.809 --> 17:42.144
are reminiscent of the great pope

17:42.227 --> 17:43.854
of gastronomy Paul Bocuse,"

17:44.271 --> 17:45.147
does that sound uppity?

17:45.230 --> 17:47.232
Why you gotta go all the way
to freaking Paris to be a chef?

17:47.357 --> 17:50.486
What? I'm gonna bag Michelin stars
in Boyle Heights? Please.

17:50.986 --> 17:52.446
Nevermind. I forgot.

17:52.529 --> 17:55.115
You and your daddy like to run off
to foreign lands to assimilate.

17:55.240 --> 17:56.700
Oh, no, no, no, baby girl,

17:56.784 --> 17:58.243
I don't think you know what foreign means.

17:58.911 --> 17:59.745
What do you care?

18:00.120 --> 18:01.830
I thought all y'all couldn't wait
to get rid of me.

18:01.914 --> 18:04.166
You, Erik, your girlfriend...

18:04.500 --> 18:07.669
She loved treating me
like yuppie trash the other night.

18:08.253 --> 18:09.755
You are a yuppie.

18:10.089 --> 18:11.090
[Ana chuckles]

18:11.381 --> 18:13.258
She wasn't treating you like trash.

18:13.592 --> 18:15.010
She was just stating the facts.

18:15.427 --> 18:16.887
Chris, Pop might lose everything,

18:16.970 --> 18:18.347
and you're over here
talking about economics.

18:18.430 --> 18:20.015
Yeah, that's just the free market,

18:20.099 --> 18:21.308
all right? I'm not trying to be a dick.

18:21.391 --> 18:23.018
Well, gold star for effort, fucker.

18:23.102 --> 18:23.977
You owe me a dollar.

18:24.144 --> 18:24.978
Girl, ssh--

18:25.062 --> 18:27.064
[cell phone rings]

18:30.234 --> 18:32.736
Oh. Ah. Work wants me to come in.

18:32.820 --> 18:35.572
But you're the only person
I can binge watch The Office with.

18:35.697 --> 18:38.826
I know, baby girl. I know,
but I gotta keep Chef Austin happy.

18:38.909 --> 18:40.327
Wait, are you seriously leaving?

18:40.410 --> 18:41.537
I don't want to piss him off.

18:41.620 --> 18:43.413
I mean, I want him to sign
my letter of rec.

18:44.039 --> 18:45.874
Great. Go on, punkass.

18:45.958 --> 18:47.543
You care all about job security,

18:47.626 --> 18:48.877
so whatever. Go.

18:49.795 --> 18:51.630
All right, forget it. [sighs]

18:51.713 --> 18:53.423
Yeah, eat Trump's culo.

19:24.079 --> 19:25.664
Oh, god, maybe
I should have worn my hoops.

19:25.747 --> 19:27.166
Fuck, I'm gonna look so basic.

19:27.249 --> 19:30.252
Baby, they don't care about your earrings.

19:30.335 --> 19:31.670
They care about your art.

19:31.920 --> 19:33.338
People are going to love you.

19:33.797 --> 19:35.215
You're a boss bitch.

19:35.549 --> 19:37.050
Now, give me your alpha pose.

19:37.467 --> 19:38.594
-[sharp exhale]
-Ooh.

19:38.802 --> 19:39.636
Too much alpha.

19:39.970 --> 19:41.221
Give me the winner pose.

19:42.014 --> 19:45.309
Mm-hm. Who's the baddest
motherfucking artist in East LA?

19:45.392 --> 19:46.685
I'm the baddest motherfucking artist
in East LA.

19:46.768 --> 19:48.312
Yes! [kisses]

19:48.687 --> 19:49.521
Danny's here.

19:49.605 --> 19:50.898
Gonna go play with him.

19:51.440 --> 19:52.357
Peace out, cub scout.

19:52.441 --> 19:53.901
Wait, stay where I can see you.

19:53.984 --> 19:54.818
She's fine.

19:55.360 --> 19:56.195
[giggling] Oh, wait.

19:56.320 --> 19:58.488
-Hola, mujer.
-Uh.

19:58.614 --> 20:00.324
-You must be beaming.
-[giggling]

20:00.407 --> 20:02.367
Tell everyone in Telelandia
your name, girl.

Hey, I'm Ana Morales.

20:04.369 --> 20:06.997
I am an artist from Boyle Heights.

20:07.122 --> 20:08.290
Oh, how cute.

20:08.665 --> 20:10.876
I didn't know Esteban's girlfriend
was an artist too.

20:11.877 --> 20:13.921
Is there a lot of friendly competition
with your man?

20:14.004 --> 20:16.256
After all, he is the star of the show.

20:16.673 --> 20:17.507
What?

20:17.841 --> 20:19.176
I ain't Esteban's girlfriend.

20:19.468 --> 20:21.970
I'm the artist who put up
that dope ass mosaic over there.

20:23.263 --> 20:24.806
Ah, perdón,

20:25.098 --> 20:26.141
I made a little boo-boo.

20:26.266 --> 20:27.517
-Let's start over. Yes?
-Yessika,

20:28.018 --> 20:28.977
where's Nayeli?

20:29.061 --> 20:30.187
Nayeli?

20:30.354 --> 20:32.356
[cell phone buzzing]

20:32.522 --> 20:34.524
THE BOOGEYMAN

20:39.363 --> 20:41.323
Are you fucking up my dish
with sage again?

20:41.406 --> 20:43.116
No, Chef, I'm fucking it up
the old-fashioned way.

20:43.200 --> 20:44.159
[chuckles]

20:44.785 --> 20:45.619
Here you go.

20:46.119 --> 20:46.954
What's this?

20:47.663 --> 20:49.122
A resignation letter?

20:49.498 --> 20:51.750
-I don't hate sage that much, kid.
-No, sir. It's the--

20:51.833 --> 20:53.919
it's a letter of rec, remember?
For cooking school?

20:54.920 --> 20:56.630
Well, why didn't you just email it to me?

20:57.547 --> 21:00.300
[stammers] It's nicer in paper.

21:02.302 --> 21:03.136
Well, luckily for you,

21:03.220 --> 21:04.304
you can write English,

21:04.972 --> 21:06.807
unlike these guys. Right?

21:11.478 --> 21:14.273
[woman from TV, speaking Spanish]

21:20.570 --> 21:22.030
[Beatriz, in Spanish] Where were you?

21:22.114 --> 21:23.073
-It's her fault.
-It's her fault.

21:23.615 --> 21:27.619
Oh, so you think you're staying
at a Motel 6 or something? Huh?

21:27.703 --> 21:30.831
Oh, please!
Let me check your bags, young lady.

21:30.914 --> 21:33.083
Stop. Look, it's Nayeli's fault.
She took off without telling me.

21:33.166 --> 21:34.167
Go to your room!

21:35.377 --> 21:36.503
Where were you?

21:36.628 --> 21:38.630
I'm sure you were
with your pesky girlfriend, right?

21:49.224 --> 21:50.434
Where are my paints, Amá?

21:50.517 --> 21:51.601
Oh, well who knows?

21:52.227 --> 21:53.979
Maybe they went on vacations.

21:54.354 --> 21:56.648
My, I wonder what it must feel like
to take a vacation.

21:56.940 --> 21:59.192
Tell them to send me a postcard.

21:59.401 --> 22:00.694
Because if you haven't noticed...

22:00.819 --> 22:03.113
I am stuck here killing myself
while you're out there playing artist!

22:03.196 --> 22:04.990
Why can't you just support me?

22:05.073 --> 22:06.658
Your grandfather can't pay
your rent anymore.

22:06.742 --> 22:08.118
Say goodbye
to your personal Don Francisco!

22:08.201 --> 22:10.620
It's time you get a real job, mijita.

22:10.704 --> 22:12.331
I have a job.

22:12.414 --> 22:13.582
A full-time job, Ana!

22:13.665 --> 22:15.667
I worked my ass off for those paints.

22:15.751 --> 22:16.835
Where are they?

22:16.918 --> 22:18.712
[sharp exhale] Hmm, let me see. [gasps]

22:19.755 --> 22:21.923
"We are on vacation in the trash.

22:22.007 --> 22:23.008
Wish you were here."

22:23.508 --> 22:24.468
[yells]

22:25.635 --> 22:27.637
Don't slam the door in my face, babosa!

22:37.981 --> 22:39.316
[big exhales]

22:43.737 --> 22:47.157
[in Spanish] I'm going to buy you
some brand new paints. You'll see! [sighs]

22:47.240 --> 22:48.367
[chuckles] Stop.

22:48.658 --> 22:49.534
-[beeps]
-A ver Whassa.

22:49.659 --> 22:52.371
What's that dumb "Amazonian" thing again?

22:52.454 --> 22:54.122
-Stop.
-No, help me!

22:54.206 --> 22:55.123
We're fucking poor, remember!

22:55.207 --> 22:58.752
Yeah, but poor people
with big dreams, chamaca!

22:58.960 --> 23:01.296
Abuelo, I can't always run
to you for everything.

23:01.380 --> 23:03.924
Why not? Who the hell says you can't? Eh?

23:04.132 --> 23:06.426
I won't let you stop painting, mija.

23:10.514 --> 23:12.349
I'll always be here for you, my love.

23:14.184 --> 23:17.270
But... I did want to talk
to you about money.

23:17.354 --> 23:19.648
No, no, it's okay. [sighs]

23:19.815 --> 23:20.732
Mom told me.

23:21.566 --> 23:22.526
I understand.

23:23.527 --> 23:24.569
I'm just trying to help and

23:25.070 --> 23:26.738
it means so much to me, but...

23:27.948 --> 23:29.991
[sighs] I just need to get a real job.

23:30.367 --> 23:31.201
[tsks]

23:32.577 --> 23:33.412
[kisses]

23:33.495 --> 23:35.497
[ranch music playing]

23:36.915 --> 23:37.749
One second, ma'am.

23:38.041 --> 23:39.334
Pop, we need you on the line!

23:43.922 --> 23:44.881
Where the hell is Geo?

23:46.633 --> 23:47.467
Geo's so late.

23:48.385 --> 23:49.928
I'm going to kill that guy!

23:55.851 --> 23:57.310
[big exhale]

23:58.520 --> 23:59.354
I let him go.

24:01.314 --> 24:02.691
Let who go where?

24:04.526 --> 24:05.986
We both know it needed to be done.

24:09.906 --> 24:10.782
You fired Geo, cabrón?

24:11.032 --> 24:12.451
-Look, I was trying to help.
-Help?

24:13.076 --> 24:14.619
Help? Huh?

24:15.287 --> 24:16.246
Help give me a heart attack, cabrón!?

24:17.998 --> 24:20.792
What in the hell were you thinking? Eh?

24:21.001 --> 24:22.711
This is my business! Not yours!

24:23.295 --> 24:24.504
I'm the boss!

24:25.046 --> 24:26.006
[customer clears throat]

24:28.175 --> 24:29.009
Get out of here!

24:31.678 --> 24:35.140
Ooh, mm-mm-mm. Mm-mm-mm.
Mm-mm-mm.

24:35.515 --> 24:36.433
Do it.

24:37.476 --> 24:38.351
I'm sorry.

24:38.602 --> 24:39.603
I'm sorry.

24:41.271 --> 24:42.105
Ooh.

24:46.318 --> 24:48.236
-[music fades out]
-All right, Pop. I got you a salad.

24:48.445 --> 24:50.405
I know you don't like it, but it's good.

24:50.864 --> 24:52.866
-I'm not hungry, mijo.
-Try it.

25:00.749 --> 25:02.542
So, why are you here, viejo?

25:03.126 --> 25:04.753
I need your help, mijo...

25:05.962 --> 25:06.796
with the business.

25:07.923 --> 25:08.840
Yeah, I'll give you money.

25:08.924 --> 25:11.384
No, no, no, no, no.
That's for cooking school.

25:11.927 --> 25:13.178
But you're very smart!

25:13.261 --> 25:15.639
You can help me improve the shop
so it pays for itself.

25:18.517 --> 25:19.976
Is Erik cool with that?

25:20.519 --> 25:21.353
Erik?

25:22.187 --> 25:24.356
Who cares what Erik thinks! Huh?

25:24.773 --> 25:26.775
Yo soy el jefe. I'm the boss. OK!

25:31.363 --> 25:32.656
I want my grandson's help.

25:33.365 --> 25:34.199
My güero's help.

25:35.867 --> 25:36.952
What do you think? Tell me.

25:39.120 --> 25:40.413
Only if you talk to Erik first.

25:45.460 --> 25:48.171
I didn't ask his permission when I offered
to let you live in my house.

25:51.007 --> 25:53.134
OK, and then you have to take the money.

25:54.886 --> 25:58.807
[stammers] Pop, I can't help you
with the changes if Mama Fina's closed.

26:05.522 --> 26:06.398
OK.

26:07.983 --> 26:08.817
[sighs]

26:09.401 --> 26:11.027
[breathes deeply]

26:12.070 --> 26:13.488
Thank you for the food, mijo.

26:23.081 --> 26:25.083
[indistinct chatter]

26:26.585 --> 26:28.545
Are you getting any viejas, Miro?

26:29.254 --> 26:30.338
Eh?

26:31.047 --> 26:33.341
[in Spanish] I don't have time to date,
dummy.

26:34.593 --> 26:37.470
At the very least
a little "cuchi-cuchi," no?

26:38.138 --> 26:39.055
[exhales]

26:39.389 --> 26:40.640
There was only one woman for me.

26:42.183 --> 26:43.018
She's gone.

26:44.311 --> 26:47.022
What does that have to do
with cuchi-cuchi?

26:48.940 --> 26:51.610
Hey, compadre,
you seem grumpier than usual.

26:51.901 --> 26:52.736
What happened?

26:55.113 --> 26:56.031
We fired Geo.

26:56.114 --> 26:58.783
-No manches.
-Geo has sciatica.

27:00.744 --> 27:03.622
-You understand, right?
-Of course, I understand!

27:03.955 --> 27:05.457
With all these greedy landlords

27:05.540 --> 27:07.667
wanting to replace us
all with ramen spots.

27:08.209 --> 27:09.044
De la chingada.

27:09.461 --> 27:10.295
But hey...

27:10.837 --> 27:13.465
didn't Geo have a glass eye?

27:13.840 --> 27:14.758
That's pretty fucked up, no?

27:16.801 --> 27:18.511
You know what's the most fucked up part?

27:20.305 --> 27:22.515
Spending your whole life
building a business,

27:22.599 --> 27:24.225
[bright guitar music playing]

27:24.309 --> 27:26.770
just so some idiot can take it away.

27:28.730 --> 27:31.775
Or that you can create a legacy
for your family...

27:32.817 --> 27:36.821
Only to discover it's not enough
to save them.

27:38.031 --> 27:41.493
Not enough to give them
a more secure future.

27:47.791 --> 27:49.918
Not even enough to help them get ahead.

27:51.169 --> 27:52.587
-Hey.
-[Chris' Dad] Why haven't you been

27:52.671 --> 27:53.546
answering my phone calls?

27:53.672 --> 27:55.799
Oh, I'm sorry, are you paying for me
to go to cooking school?

27:55.882 --> 27:57.175
Oh, so you could waste
my money on chingaderas?

27:57.258 --> 27:58.635
OK, well, fuck you too, Dad.

27:59.052 --> 28:00.595
-Love you. Bye.
-What--

28:01.221 --> 28:03.348
So they can pursue big dreams

28:03.431 --> 28:07.018
that  we could never
have imagined for ourselves.

28:09.020 --> 28:12.732
Instead... it can all get bulldozed.

28:14.192 --> 28:15.944
As if we're worthless.

28:17.946 --> 28:20.907
As if we don't exist.

28:25.829 --> 28:30.291
Fuck... your... development mother!

28:31.626 --> 28:32.502
But you know what?

28:34.045 --> 28:36.047
Everyone can go to hell.

28:37.006 --> 28:39.092
I'm in my hood and here...

28:39.718 --> 28:41.010
