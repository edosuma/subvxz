00:28.695 --> 00:30.778
<i>My father took pride in saying</i>

00:30.989 --> 00:33.072
<i>that he ran our house
like a tight ship.</i>

00:33.784 --> 00:35.491
<i>The ship got a lot looser when</i>

00:35.702 --> 00:38.365
<i>my meemaw came over to babysit.</i>

00:39.289 --> 00:40.871
I bet a nickel.

00:42.292 --> 00:43.908
Hang on there a minute,
moon pie.

00:44.127 --> 00:45.538
<i>I want to teach
you somethin'.</i>

00:45.754 --> 00:46.835
Look at your cards,

00:47.047 --> 00:48.663
<i>and then look
in the mirror.</i>

00:49.383 --> 00:50.499
Hey, I'm smiling.

00:50.884 --> 00:51.874
Uh-huh.

00:52.094 --> 00:52.709
<i>And what does that</i>

00:52.928 --> 00:54.590
tell me about your cards?

00:54.805 --> 00:55.966
That I like them?

00:56.181 --> 00:57.638
Attaboy. Now...

00:58.517 --> 00:59.553
look at my face.

00:59.851 --> 01:00.637
<i>Tell me</i>

01:00.852 --> 01:02.013
what you see.

01:02.646 --> 01:03.511
That you're old.

01:04.355 --> 01:05.688
It's a good thing I love you.

01:05.899 --> 01:08.141
<i>I'm
gonna look at my cards again.</i>

01:10.404 --> 01:11.394
You're unhappy.

01:11.780 --> 01:12.861
Which means...?

01:13.073 --> 01:14.439
You don't have good cards.

01:14.658 --> 01:16.524
Mm-hmm.

01:17.327 --> 01:18.033
So...

01:18.412 --> 01:20.369
I'm gonna see
your nickel...

01:20.956 --> 01:22.993
<i>- and raise you a quarter.</i>
- Quarter?

01:23.375 --> 01:24.616
You can fold.

01:25.085 --> 01:27.668
No. I have good cards;
you have bad cards.

01:27.879 --> 01:29.040
I'm in.

01:30.215 --> 01:32.252
- Nines and fives.
- Mm.

01:32.467 --> 01:33.878
That's too bad.

01:34.511 --> 01:36.047
Three queens. You lose!

01:36.263 --> 01:37.674
<i>What?</i>

01:37.889 --> 01:39.050
But you weren't happy.

01:39.266 --> 01:42.179
- I made you <i>think</i> I was unhappy.
- But that's lying.

01:42.394 --> 01:43.805
You lied to your moon pie.

01:44.021 --> 01:46.388
I bluffed my moon pie.

01:48.233 --> 01:50.395
- Do people know about this?
<i>- Sheldon,</i>

01:50.611 --> 01:52.022
what's on a person's face

01:52.237 --> 01:54.729
is not always
what's in their heart.

01:55.657 --> 01:57.068
Well, this changes everything.

01:57.284 --> 01:58.525
How do you know who to trust?

01:58.744 --> 01:59.825
You don't.

02:00.537 --> 02:03.029
That's what makes life
interesting.

02:03.457 --> 02:06.746
<i>Meemaw liked to teach
me things that kept me awake at night.</i>

02:06.960 --> 02:07.950
Mom, we're home!

02:08.169 --> 02:09.080
In here!

02:09.713 --> 02:10.874
What's he doing up?

02:11.089 --> 02:12.170
Losin'.

02:13.717 --> 02:14.878
Hell is that?

02:15.093 --> 02:16.550
I sent Georgie
on a beer run,

02:16.762 --> 02:18.879
and tipped him
with firecrackers.

02:19.264 --> 02:19.924
Oh, Mom.

02:20.140 --> 02:21.597
Was I supposed to stiff him?

02:22.643 --> 02:26.102
I ate so much candy!

02:28.065 --> 02:29.181
Okay.

02:30.525 --> 02:31.561
They're all yours.

02:58.387 --> 03:01.004
Sometimes people say to me,
"Pastor Jeff,

03:01.223 --> 03:02.634
how do you know there's a God?"

03:02.849 --> 03:05.387
And I say, "It's simple math.

03:05.602 --> 03:08.015
God either exists
or he doesn't."

03:08.230 --> 03:09.186
<i>So let's be cynical.</i>

03:09.398 --> 03:12.232
Worst-case scenario,
there's a 50-50 chance.

03:12.442 --> 03:14.104
And I like those odds.

03:14.820 --> 03:15.776
That's wrong.

03:16.113 --> 03:17.775
Shelly,
put your hand down.

03:18.240 --> 03:19.651
Sorry. Please continue.

03:20.158 --> 03:21.274
It's okay, Mary.

03:21.493 --> 03:22.734
I-It's Sheldon, right?

03:22.953 --> 03:24.785
- Yes, sir.
<i>- Well, Sheldon,</i>

03:24.996 --> 03:27.329
why don't you come on up here
and tell me how I'm wrong.

03:27.541 --> 03:28.873
- No.
- Okay.

03:29.334 --> 03:31.166
Let's give him
a hand, everybody.

03:31.753 --> 03:34.040
Mm. What's happening?

03:40.595 --> 03:42.757
Shelly's gonna eat him
alive.

03:43.014 --> 03:43.629
<i>So...</i>

03:43.890 --> 03:44.755
you were saying?

03:45.100 --> 03:47.888
You've confused possibilities
with probabilities.

03:48.103 --> 03:49.844
According to your analogy,
when I go home

03:50.063 --> 03:53.181
I might find a million dollars
on my bed or I might not.

03:53.400 --> 03:55.266
In what universe
is that 50-50?

03:56.987 --> 03:57.898
<i>So what do you think</i>

03:58.113 --> 04:00.196
the odds are
that God exists?

04:01.032 --> 04:01.897
I think they're zero.

04:02.117 --> 04:03.574
I believe in science.

04:05.662 --> 04:06.277
<i>So you don't think</i>

04:06.496 --> 04:08.863
science and religion
can go hand in hand?

04:09.249 --> 04:11.957
Science is facts,
religion is faith.

04:12.169 --> 04:13.626
- I prefer facts.
- Mm.

04:14.337 --> 04:15.544
I understand that.

04:15.756 --> 04:16.791
Here's a cool fact for ya.

04:17.007 --> 04:18.464
A lot of famous scientists

04:18.675 --> 04:20.132
believed in God.

04:20.927 --> 04:21.632
Isaac Newton.

04:21.845 --> 04:23.006
Albert Einstein.

04:23.221 --> 04:24.962
Even Charles Darwin.

04:27.058 --> 04:30.176
So Darwin's right about God
and wrong about evolution?

04:30.479 --> 04:31.390
Now you're gettin' it.

04:31.605 --> 04:33.187
Let's give it up
for Sheldon, everybody.

04:33.398 --> 04:35.560
What a good sport. Oh.

04:37.903 --> 04:39.690
<i>But I wasn't a good sport.</i>

04:39.905 --> 04:41.737
<i>At that moment,
I vowed to come back</i>

04:41.948 --> 04:45.567
<i>the following Sunday
and destroy Pastor Jeff.</i>

04:56.213 --> 04:57.420
Uh, hello, Mr. Cooper.

04:57.631 --> 04:58.872
Is Missy home?

04:59.174 --> 05:01.507
Hello, Billy.
No, she's at church.

05:03.094 --> 05:05.131
I brought her eggs
from my chickens.

05:05.972 --> 05:07.088
I see that.

05:08.016 --> 05:10.133
You can boil them
or scramble them.

05:11.394 --> 05:12.510
Okay.

05:14.397 --> 05:15.933
I like fried.

05:16.983 --> 05:18.440
Okay.

05:20.529 --> 05:22.191
I don't like poached.

05:23.657 --> 05:24.989
Okay.

05:27.452 --> 05:28.613
Thank you for your time.

05:33.917 --> 05:35.203
Okay.

05:36.920 --> 05:39.003
<i>You want me to cook
those eggs for you, baby?</i>

05:39.297 --> 05:40.913
No. They're a gift.

05:41.925 --> 05:42.631
Sorry.

05:42.843 --> 05:44.334
He even wrote me a note.

05:44.803 --> 05:48.467
"Eggs from your
secret admirer. Billy."

05:49.140 --> 05:50.176
<i>Mary, can you come in here?</i>

05:50.559 --> 05:51.845
I'm cookin'.

05:52.060 --> 05:53.892
<i>I really need you
to come in here.</i>

05:54.437 --> 05:55.769
What on earth?

05:57.607 --> 05:58.347
Uh-oh.

05:58.859 --> 05:59.599
What?

05:59.943 --> 06:00.979
Listen to this.

06:02.112 --> 06:03.148
"French philosopher,

06:03.363 --> 06:06.276
"mathematician and physicist,
Blaise Pascal,

06:06.491 --> 06:09.950
"argued a rational person
should believe God exists

06:10.161 --> 06:12.574
"because you have everything
to gain if you're right,

06:12.789 --> 06:14.781
and nothing to lose
if you're wrong."

06:15.500 --> 06:16.707
Sounds right.

06:19.212 --> 06:20.043
Meemaw is coming over

06:20.255 --> 06:21.666
to watch you... I gotta go.

06:22.090 --> 06:24.673
- Where?
- Daddy's not feeling good.

06:24.885 --> 06:26.376
We're gonna go see a doctor.

06:27.137 --> 06:28.423
- Is he okay?
<i>- He's gonna be fine.</i>

06:28.638 --> 06:29.503
You just sit right there.

06:29.723 --> 06:31.510
Meemaw's on her way over
to cook you dinner.

06:32.058 --> 06:32.923
Can we come with you?

06:33.143 --> 06:35.385
No. Just stay right there,
don't move.

06:35.979 --> 06:37.345
George, let's go.

06:50.577 --> 06:52.569
How long are we
supposed to sit here?

06:52.787 --> 06:53.868
I don't know.

06:54.247 --> 06:55.283
She said don't move.

06:55.498 --> 06:57.535
She was very clear.

06:59.169 --> 07:00.956
Hope I don't have
to go to the bathroom.

07:04.049 --> 07:04.914
<i>Don't worry!</i>

07:05.133 --> 07:06.374
<i>Meemaw's here!</i>

07:06.593 --> 07:08.710
Everything's under control!

07:09.137 --> 07:10.218
Oh.

07:10.430 --> 07:11.841
We haven't had dinner yet.

07:12.432 --> 07:13.092
Really?

07:16.019 --> 07:17.681
I don't feel like cookin'.

07:22.108 --> 07:23.849
I think my husband's having
a heart attack!

07:25.153 --> 07:27.145
<i>I need an RRT
and a crash cart.</i>

07:27.364 --> 07:28.354
Over here.

07:29.741 --> 07:32.609
Sir, are you having
chest pains right now?

07:32.869 --> 07:33.780
Yeah, a little bit.

07:33.995 --> 07:36.078
<i>Any numbness
or pain in your arms?</i>

07:36.373 --> 07:37.329
Maybe this one.

07:37.916 --> 07:38.576
Shortness of breath?

07:38.792 --> 07:39.498
Enough questions.

07:39.709 --> 07:41.325
He's a fat, middle-aged man
with chest pains.

07:41.544 --> 07:42.250
Do something!

07:42.462 --> 07:44.749
<i>- All right.</i>
- Sorry about the fat, honey.

07:45.131 --> 07:46.872
You said you liked me this way.

07:48.927 --> 07:50.543
Is Daddy gonna be okay?

07:50.762 --> 07:52.549
Oh, yeah.
Your Pop-Pop used to have

07:52.764 --> 07:54.721
little chest pains all the time.

07:55.058 --> 07:56.890
Didn't he die of a heart attack?

07:57.102 --> 07:59.594
Well,
for insurance purposes, yes.

08:02.774 --> 08:04.231
Hey. What's goin' on?

08:04.693 --> 08:06.059
Dad's in
the hospital.

08:06.361 --> 08:08.193
What? Why's Dad in the hospital?

08:08.405 --> 08:09.987
- He's gonna be fine.
- He had chest pains.

08:10.198 --> 08:11.439
He's gonna be fine.

08:11.825 --> 08:13.441
What are we doin'? Why
aren't we going to the hospital?

08:13.660 --> 08:15.151
Nobody's goin' nowhere.

08:15.662 --> 08:16.903
<i>We're just
gonna stay calm,</i>

08:17.122 --> 08:19.239
have a nice dinner,
and wait for your mama to call

08:19.457 --> 08:20.743
and tell us what's what.

08:21.459 --> 08:22.700
I'm not hungry.

08:26.089 --> 08:28.081
What did you mean
by "insurance purposes"?

08:28.299 --> 08:29.460
Just eat.

08:37.892 --> 08:40.851
What kind of Texan drinks
pink wine?

08:46.651 --> 08:47.391
Hello.

08:47.610 --> 08:49.101
Hi, Mom. Kids okay?

08:49.320 --> 08:51.061
Yeah, they're fine.
How's George?

08:51.448 --> 08:53.360
I don't know.
They're running tests.

08:54.117 --> 08:57.531
Well, don't you worry about us.

08:57.746 --> 09:00.079
Everything's under control here.

09:01.082 --> 09:01.993
Okay.

09:02.208 --> 09:03.949
I'll call you when I know more.

09:04.544 --> 09:05.785
How you holdin' up?

09:07.005 --> 09:08.212
I guess I'm okay.

09:08.423 --> 09:10.380
<i>Well, George is gonna pull
through this, honey.</i>

09:10.717 --> 09:12.583
I guarantee it.

09:13.678 --> 09:14.919
Thanks, Mom.

09:15.138 --> 09:16.219
Thanks for bein' there.

09:16.806 --> 09:17.887
You bet.

09:18.975 --> 09:19.840
I'll call you later.

09:20.060 --> 09:20.891
<i>Okay.</i>

09:21.186 --> 09:22.097
Bye.

09:24.064 --> 09:25.726
What'd she say?

09:26.066 --> 09:28.979
The doctors are doin' some
tests, but, dollars to donuts,

09:29.194 --> 09:31.732
your daddy's just got
a bad case of gas.

09:32.447 --> 09:34.063
Y'all two go
get ready for bed.

09:34.282 --> 09:36.023
I don't want to stay
around here.

09:36.242 --> 09:38.074
I want to go to the hospital
and see Dad.

09:38.286 --> 09:40.152
Well, I want to go to Las Vegas
and see Willie Nelson,

09:40.371 --> 09:42.203
but that ain't gonna happen
either.

09:42.665 --> 09:44.031
This is stupid.

09:44.417 --> 09:45.658
<i>You know
what's stupid?</i>

09:45.877 --> 09:47.834
I got to drink pink wine!

09:49.214 --> 09:49.874
Meemaw?

09:50.381 --> 09:50.996
What?

09:51.216 --> 09:52.832
Is Dad really okay?

09:54.177 --> 09:55.463
Yes.

09:56.179 --> 09:58.011
I hope you're
not bluffing.

10:07.690 --> 10:08.897
You asleep?

10:10.193 --> 10:11.149
No.

10:11.611 --> 10:12.818
Me neither.

10:13.613 --> 10:16.321
Every time the phone rings,
I get scared.

10:18.701 --> 10:20.033
Me, too.

10:22.747 --> 10:24.704
I'm goin' to see Dad.
You guys want to come?

10:24.916 --> 10:27.624
How? Meemaw said
we have to stay here.

10:27.919 --> 10:29.660
You want to go or not?

10:37.846 --> 10:38.757
Shh.

10:40.265 --> 10:41.301
Shh.

10:42.725 --> 10:43.715
Who do I shush?

10:43.935 --> 10:45.016
- Shh!
- Shh!

11:07.625 --> 11:08.866
What are you doing?

11:09.085 --> 11:10.371
I'm driving
to the hospital.

11:10.587 --> 11:12.920
You can come with me
or stay here... up to you.

11:13.173 --> 11:14.163
I'm comin'.

11:15.758 --> 11:16.464
Sheldon?

11:16.801 --> 11:17.416
You're 14.

11:17.635 --> 11:19.092
You don't know how to drive.

11:19.304 --> 11:20.761
I drove a tractor at 4-H camp.

11:20.972 --> 11:22.213
It's the same thing.

11:22.432 --> 11:24.594
But you sat on the farmer's lap.

11:24.809 --> 11:25.890
Then stay here.

11:26.102 --> 11:27.263
Come on, Missy.

11:39.490 --> 11:40.480
What are you doin'?

11:40.700 --> 11:42.157
Travelin' music.

11:42.660 --> 11:43.446
<i>Ugh.</i>

11:43.661 --> 11:45.118
I'm coming with you.

11:45.330 --> 11:46.912
Why are you wearin' my helmet?

11:47.123 --> 11:49.831
I don't expect this to end well.

11:50.084 --> 11:51.200
And the pillows?

11:51.419 --> 11:52.705
Same answer.

11:54.047 --> 11:55.504
Turn it off.
I've got to concentrate.

11:55.715 --> 11:57.001
Aw.

11:57.383 --> 11:58.965
<i>Okay,</i>

11:59.177 --> 12:00.384
seat belts, everybody.

12:01.304 --> 12:02.761
Please drive slowly.

12:02.972 --> 12:04.838
Relax. I know what I'm doin'.

12:05.892 --> 12:07.053
- Whoa!
- Whoa!

12:07.268 --> 12:08.475
<i>I've often been asked</i>

12:08.686 --> 12:10.973
<i>why I never learned
to drive a car.</i>

12:11.189 --> 12:12.145
<i>This night...</i>

12:13.942 --> 12:15.274
<i>is your answer.</i>

12:15.818 --> 12:17.150
Please slow down.

12:17.362 --> 12:18.478
I'm goin' eight
miles an hour.

12:18.780 --> 12:20.146
A cow just passed us.

12:20.365 --> 12:22.948
- Do you know how to get to the hospital?
- Yeah.

12:23.159 --> 12:24.946
It's right across the street
from the Dairy Queen.

12:25.161 --> 12:26.572
Which Dairy Queen?

12:26.788 --> 12:27.995
What are you talkin' about?

12:28.248 --> 12:29.238
There's two.

12:29.624 --> 12:30.239
Really?

12:30.458 --> 12:31.118
You're gonna hit it!

12:31.334 --> 12:32.450
Which is the one
Mom takes us to?

12:32.669 --> 12:33.580
You're gonna hit it!

12:36.839 --> 12:38.831
Ooh, you're in trouble now!

13:03.157 --> 13:03.988
Yeah?

13:04.617 --> 13:06.199
What took you so long to answer?

13:06.411 --> 13:08.528
Powdering my nose.
What's it to ya?

13:09.414 --> 13:11.747
Sorry I asked. Just wanted
to give you an update.

13:12.333 --> 13:14.120
Y... What's goin' on?

13:14.585 --> 13:16.042
They want to run
some more tests.

13:16.254 --> 13:17.836
They're gonna hold him
overnight.

13:18.047 --> 13:20.915
Oh. Oh, well, that's, that's
nothin' to worry about.

13:21.134 --> 13:22.545
That's just precautionary.

13:23.261 --> 13:24.217
How are the kids?

13:24.429 --> 13:26.216
Oh.
They were a little worried,

13:26.431 --> 13:28.593
but I handled it.

13:28.891 --> 13:29.881
They sleepin'?

13:30.143 --> 13:31.179
Um...

13:32.729 --> 13:34.095
Yeah, yeah.

13:34.355 --> 13:35.391
You bet.

13:36.399 --> 13:37.480
Thanks again for helpin'.

13:37.692 --> 13:38.603
<i>Oh, hey,</i>

13:38.818 --> 13:40.150
these are my grandchildren.

13:40.361 --> 13:42.102
They are my blood.

13:42.739 --> 13:43.729
Okay. I better go.

13:43.948 --> 13:46.611
<i>Okay. We'll talk later.</i>

13:59.881 --> 14:00.997
<i>Son of a bitch.</i>

14:03.509 --> 14:05.421
I hate those kids.

14:09.349 --> 14:11.056
<i>Just admit it, we're lost.</i>

14:11.309 --> 14:12.470
We're not lost.

14:12.685 --> 14:14.722
Well, I sure don't see
a hospital anywhere.

14:15.104 --> 14:17.187
Why don't we ask somebody
for directions?

14:17.398 --> 14:19.685
Because we're children
in a car, genius.

14:21.319 --> 14:22.059
<i>Dang it!</i>

14:22.278 --> 14:23.940
Are you aiming for them?

14:24.155 --> 14:25.942
Everybody just shut up.
I got this.

14:29.202 --> 14:31.945
Oh, no.
We're going to jail.

14:32.163 --> 14:33.574
Georgie's going to jail.

14:33.790 --> 14:35.281
I'm saying I was kidnapped.

14:35.875 --> 14:36.706
<i>That's a good plan.</i>

14:36.918 --> 14:38.454
You <i>and</i> I were kidnapped.

14:38.669 --> 14:41.002
If I'm going to jail,
we're all going to jail.

14:41.589 --> 14:44.206
Oh, you better pull over.

14:48.763 --> 14:50.129
<i>Oh, thank God.</i>

14:50.473 --> 14:52.715
- Well, don't just sit there... follow it.
- Why?

14:52.934 --> 14:55.176
It's an ambulance...
it's going to the hospital.

14:56.437 --> 14:57.473
Hang on.

15:00.983 --> 15:03.100
<i>How about I put
the radio on real low?</i>

15:03.319 --> 15:04.435
<i>Shut up.</i>

15:06.239 --> 15:06.899
Mary.

15:07.323 --> 15:07.938
Mom!

15:08.157 --> 15:09.944
- Where are they?
- Where's who?

15:10.868 --> 15:12.200
More importantly...

15:15.456 --> 15:16.947
- ...how is George?
<i>- Mom!</i>

15:17.417 --> 15:19.500
- Ah. There they are!
- Hey. Oh.

15:19.710 --> 15:20.951
<i>Ha! I lost
the little rascals</i>

15:21.170 --> 15:22.877
in the... hall.

15:23.589 --> 15:24.500
I want to see Dad.

15:24.715 --> 15:25.580
- Me, too.
- Me, too.

15:25.800 --> 15:26.961
The doctors are
with him now.

15:27.176 --> 15:28.292
I'll take you in a bit.

15:28.511 --> 15:29.718
Why are they here?

15:30.346 --> 15:31.757
I think it's obvious.

15:32.014 --> 15:33.255
They love their daddy.

15:33.516 --> 15:36.429
No, I get that.
Why aren't they home in bed?

15:41.482 --> 15:43.189
Well, nobody could sleep.

15:43.818 --> 15:45.434
I thought it was
the right thing.

15:48.114 --> 15:48.774
Good bluff.

15:48.990 --> 15:50.071
Shh.

15:50.867 --> 15:52.153
Okay, thank you.

15:52.410 --> 15:53.821
You all need anything?
You hungry?

15:54.036 --> 15:55.026
- No.
- No, thank you.

15:55.246 --> 15:56.953
Okay, everybody sit tight.

15:57.165 --> 15:59.077
I'm gonna go check
on your dad.

16:01.627 --> 16:02.287
Georgie.

16:04.005 --> 16:05.086
Give me my damn keys.

16:05.298 --> 16:07.665
Oh, yeah. Here.

16:08.634 --> 16:09.590
Thank you.

16:11.387 --> 16:12.798
How did I beat you here?

16:13.139 --> 16:15.051
We kept hitting
garbage cans.

16:15.266 --> 16:16.256
Oh, God.

16:16.851 --> 16:17.967
I need to wash
my hands.

16:18.186 --> 16:21.270
- There are germs here that can kill you.
- Hold up.

16:21.939 --> 16:24.306
Now, y'all like it
when your meemaw babysits.

16:24.525 --> 16:26.812
Poker, candy,
firecrackers.

16:27.069 --> 16:28.435
- Yes.
- Yeah. - Yeah.

16:28.654 --> 16:30.486
Well, if your mother
ever finds out

16:30.781 --> 16:32.192
what you did tonight,

16:32.408 --> 16:34.775
that is never
gonna happen again.

16:34.994 --> 16:36.405
I can't lie
to my mother.

16:36.621 --> 16:39.329
Sure you can.
Believe in yourself!

17:48.568 --> 17:50.104
<i>Despite what it looks like,</i>

17:50.319 --> 17:52.151
<i>I didn't pray to God
that night.</i>

17:52.363 --> 17:54.855
<i>I prayed to Blaise Pascal.</i>

17:55.199 --> 17:56.531
<i>My thinking was,</i>

17:56.742 --> 17:59.234
<i>if he was right
about the existence of God,</i>

17:59.453 --> 18:01.115
<i>then he could pass along
my request</i>

18:01.330 --> 18:02.912
<i>for my dad to get better.</i>

18:03.499 --> 18:05.081
<i>If he was wrong...</i>

18:05.793 --> 18:06.624
<i>well...</i>

18:07.253 --> 18:10.212
<i>in this moment,
I needed him to be right.</i>

18:16.262 --> 18:17.503
What's taking so long?

18:17.722 --> 18:18.382
Shh.

18:18.598 --> 18:20.681
Keep your voice down, car thief.

18:20.891 --> 18:23.258
I didn't steal your car,
I just borrowed it.

18:23.769 --> 18:26.182
You're gonna need
to make bail someday.

18:26.606 --> 18:29.724
Do not come to me.

18:30.276 --> 18:30.891
<i>Good news!</i>

18:31.110 --> 18:32.317
Your daddy's gonna be fine.

18:32.528 --> 18:34.736
- Should be home in a day or two.
- Oh!

18:34.947 --> 18:36.108
And was it a heart attack?

18:36.324 --> 18:37.656
Minor. No permanent damage.

18:37.908 --> 18:39.991
Oh! That's wonderful!

18:40.202 --> 18:41.818
Our prayers have been answered.

18:43.331 --> 18:43.946
<i>Come on,
everybody,</i>

18:44.165 --> 18:45.872
let's say hello to your old dad.

18:48.377 --> 18:49.208
Come on.

18:50.087 --> 18:51.077
<i>For a brief moment,</i>

18:51.297 --> 18:54.461
<i>I was filled with
the healing power of faith.</i>

18:55.551 --> 18:57.713
<i>Then the next day,
we all got violently ill</i>

18:57.928 --> 19:00.841
<i>from Billy Sparks' eggs,
and I was over it.</i>

19:05.269 --> 19:08.353
I thought I'd talk this morning
about how it all began.

19:08.689 --> 19:11.648
<i>Now, everybody knows how,
on the first day of creation,</i>

19:11.859 --> 19:14.101
<i>God said, "Let there be light."</i>

19:14.403 --> 19:15.689
<i>And there was light.</i>

19:15.905 --> 19:19.148
And when God saw that light,
he knew it was good.

19:20.701 --> 19:21.532
Oh, here we go.

19:22.370 --> 19:23.406
Yes, Sheldon.

19:23.621 --> 19:26.830
You said he didn't create
the sun until day four.

19:27.208 --> 19:27.868
Yeah.

19:28.084 --> 19:30.371
So how could there be light
the first three days?

19:30.628 --> 19:32.164
God is light.

19:32.380 --> 19:33.837
<i>So God's a photon?</i>

19:36.842 --> 19:38.208
God's what made photons
possible.

19:38.427 --> 19:40.168
And what day did he do that?

19:40.471 --> 19:41.803
I would think day one.

19:42.306 --> 19:44.639
If I grab my chest and keel over,
maybe we can get out of here.

19:44.850 --> 19:46.512
That's a terrible
thing to say.

19:46.727 --> 19:48.559
...because the first day
had just begun.

19:48.771 --> 19:50.182
So, before the Big Bang?

19:50.398 --> 19:51.605
There was no Big Bang.

19:51.816 --> 19:53.148
There was only the Word.

19:53.359 --> 19:55.146
Was the word "kaboom"?

19:55.403 --> 19:56.564
Okay, do it.

19:57.738 --> 19:58.603
We gotta go.

20:00.366 --> 20:01.447
<i>What's happening?</i>

20:01.659 --> 20:03.525
<i>- Is it over?</i>
- Y-Yes.
