* God bless America again

00:38.339 --> 00:43.744
* You see all the troubles
that she's in

00:46.814 --> 00:50.551
* Wash her pretty face

00:50.551 --> 00:54.722
* Dry her eyes and then... *

00:54.722 --> 00:58.259
She's a real beauty, huh?
Yep, a real beaut.

00:58.259 --> 01:01.295
This car is for you.
Now, let me guess.

01:01.295 --> 01:03.297
The man of the house
needs a second car

01:03.297 --> 01:05.533
so the little lady
can go to the garden club

01:05.533 --> 01:08.436
while he plays gin rummy
with the boys, huh?

01:08.436 --> 01:11.439
Oh. Actually, we need a car
so we can go rock climbing.

01:11.439 --> 01:14.074
Rock climbing?
Why would anybody
go climb a rock?

01:14.074 --> 01:15.509
Man, things are changing.

01:15.509 --> 01:18.646
I remember when men were men
and women were gals

01:18.646 --> 01:20.514
and we'd call coloreds,
coloreds.

01:20.514 --> 01:22.650
You know, actually,
I think we're gonna get going.

01:22.650 --> 01:24.452
Hey, come on,
sweetie, don't be a bitch.

01:24.452 --> 01:25.953
Let's talk some numbers here.

01:25.953 --> 01:28.156
Hey, hey, hey, don't talk
to my wife like that.

01:28.156 --> 01:33.127
Hey, boy, I fought
in the big war. I mean,
nobody tells me what to do.

01:33.127 --> 01:34.828
You understand?
Hold this.

01:36.297 --> 01:37.998
Oh, my God.

01:37.998 --> 01:40.301
Audie Murphy, motherfucker.

01:42.203 --> 01:44.472
Somebody get
Dick Lewiston
off the lot.

01:44.472 --> 01:47.375
What's it matter anyways,
Mr. Selleck?
No one's selling anything.

01:47.375 --> 01:48.742
It's a damn killing
field out there.

01:48.742 --> 01:51.812
Mr. Selleck,
I think I made a sale.

01:51.812 --> 01:54.047
Terrific. Good job, Teddy.

01:54.047 --> 01:55.416
And he wants to pay in cash,

01:55.416 --> 01:56.684
non-sequential unmarked bills

01:56.684 --> 01:58.152
neatly packed
in this canvas bag.

01:58.152 --> 01:59.887
Well, that's
a bank bag, Teddy.

01:59.887 --> 02:01.222
(SCREAMING)

02:02.323 --> 02:06.327
My eyes. My eyes. My LASIK.

02:06.327 --> 02:07.761
Oh, shit. Somebody
call the cops.

02:07.761 --> 02:09.797
TEDDY: It burns!
Teddy, go flush your eyes out.

02:09.797 --> 02:12.200
I feel like a Smurf
just jizzed in my face.

02:12.200 --> 02:14.168
We got to do something.

02:14.168 --> 02:15.769
I've had this lot 27 years,

02:15.769 --> 02:18.071
and it's dying
right before my eyes.

02:18.071 --> 02:20.941
We either do something
drastic, or we pull the plug.

02:20.941 --> 02:24.712
I'm thinking about
calling a hotshot,
a weekend warrior.

02:25.813 --> 02:27.815
I was thinking about
calling a mercenary.

02:27.815 --> 02:29.183
What?

02:30.718 --> 02:31.952
A mercenary?

02:31.952 --> 02:34.422
Hell, Zooha,
I got no choice.

02:34.422 --> 02:38.025
The bank's crawling up my ass
for back payments.

02:38.025 --> 02:40.461
If we don't turn this thing
around by August,

02:40.461 --> 02:42.630
this place is gonna be a TCBY.

02:42.630 --> 02:44.265
But a mercenary?

02:44.265 --> 02:45.733
All they do is sell cars
and move on.

02:45.733 --> 02:48.636
There's no connection
to the community, Ben.

02:48.636 --> 02:51.405
Don't do this.
It hasn't gotten
that bad, has it?

02:51.405 --> 02:55.309
Please, God, forgive me
for what I'm about to do.

03:05.419 --> 03:07.921
By the way, great sale.

03:07.921 --> 03:09.122
Hear, hear.

03:09.122 --> 03:10.758
Oh, very good.

03:12.059 --> 03:14.928
Thank you, darling.
I don't know why,

03:14.928 --> 03:16.597
but I can't enjoy breakfast
anywhere but a strip club.

03:16.597 --> 03:19.166
My mom used to always
cook bacon naked.

03:19.166 --> 03:21.034
She would cook bacon
all day long.

Yes. Yeah.

03:28.075 --> 03:29.410
Mmm-hmm.

03:29.410 --> 03:32.112
You want some cars sold.
We'll be there.

03:32.112 --> 03:36.317
Fourth of July weekend,
three-day sale. We got
a dealership in the ICU.

03:36.317 --> 03:39.119
Two hundred and eleven cars
getting suntans on the lot.

03:39.119 --> 03:42.923
Guess what, fellas?
We're going to Temecula.

03:42.923 --> 03:44.458
Oh, fuck, Don.

03:44.458 --> 03:46.894
Honey, we just finished
the last job three hours ago.

03:46.894 --> 03:48.296
I still smell like customer.

03:48.296 --> 03:49.930
Don, I don't mean to complain,

03:49.930 --> 03:53.100
but it's been a year and a half
since I've been home.

03:53.100 --> 03:56.036
And I'm 90% sure
I left my front door open.

03:56.036 --> 03:58.372
I don't know, Don.
I think we sit this one out.

03:58.372 --> 04:00.774
You've been pushing us
pretty hard since 'Querque.

04:00.774 --> 04:03.711
Forget about 'Querque,
all right?

04:03.711 --> 04:05.446
What do we do? We sell cars.

04:05.446 --> 04:08.048
What does a tiger do?
Hunts and kills prey.

04:08.048 --> 04:09.850
What else are we gonna do
in this life?

04:09.850 --> 04:11.752
I need every swinging dick
in that field.

04:11.752 --> 04:14.588
Babs, come on.
Let's do it.

04:23.431 --> 04:26.834
All right. We are headed
to Temecula, California.

04:26.834 --> 04:28.436
Population 98,000.

04:28.436 --> 04:32.740
It's a family business. Owner,
one Benjamin K. Selleck.

04:32.740 --> 04:35.309
Married 30 years
to wife, Tammy.

04:35.309 --> 04:38.312
One daughter, Ivy, age 29,
looks good in beat-up jeans.

04:38.312 --> 04:40.213
DON: Yes, she does.

04:40.213 --> 04:42.383
One son named Peter, age 10,

04:42.383 --> 04:44.952
loves robot dinosaurs
and pizza night.

04:44.952 --> 04:47.655
Looks like 10-year-old Peter
got a five o'clock shadow.

04:47.655 --> 04:49.790
Yeah, it must be the fax ink.

04:49.790 --> 04:53.661
God bless the Hacienda Court,
but their fax service...

04:53.661 --> 04:55.128
What are you doing, honey?

04:55.128 --> 04:56.464
Enjoying myself.

04:57.765 --> 05:00.468
Oh! Sir, there's no smoking
on airplanes.

05:00.468 --> 05:04.805
I know. It's ridiculous,
isn't it? Don't worry
about it, I'll be quick.

05:04.805 --> 05:07.908
Sir, if you light that,
I'll have to report you
to the FAA.

05:09.643 --> 05:12.580
Stacey, do you know when
the first commercial
flight went smokeless?

05:12.580 --> 05:15.315
No.
1973.

05:15.315 --> 05:16.950
And did you know that in 1969,

05:16.950 --> 05:19.487
when smoking was allowed
on all flights,

05:19.487 --> 05:21.489
we put a man on the moon?

05:21.489 --> 05:23.924
I had no idea.

05:23.924 --> 05:26.660
Look.

05:26.660 --> 05:28.529
You know what that is?

05:28.529 --> 05:33.467
That's a remnant
of a better time,
but they welded it shut.

05:33.467 --> 05:35.369
And it starts with ashtrays,

05:35.369 --> 05:40.874
and it ends with all of
our precious freedoms
being stripped away.

05:40.874 --> 05:43.877
Hmm. I remember
back in the day
when you got on a plane

05:43.877 --> 05:46.079
and you knew you were in
for a good time.

05:46.079 --> 05:47.681
A little smoking,
a little drinking.

05:47.681 --> 05:50.451
Yeah.
And the stewardesses.

05:50.451 --> 05:56.289
Stacey, you come
from a proud tradition
of blazing hot stewardesses.

05:56.289 --> 05:57.791
(CHUCKLES)

05:57.791 --> 06:00.394
And now you can't
do one damn thing

06:00.394 --> 06:04.398
without someone reporting you
to the Department of
Homeland Security.

06:04.398 --> 06:05.799
Am I right?
JIBBY: That's right.

06:05.799 --> 06:06.967
BRENT:
You listen to Don.

06:06.967 --> 06:08.569
DON:
I had to take my pants off

06:08.569 --> 06:10.704
and nibble my Old Spice
down to three ounces

06:10.704 --> 06:12.072
just to get on the plane,
Stacey.

06:12.072 --> 06:13.874
They made me throw out
my mouthwash.

06:13.874 --> 06:15.609
I had to give up
my bath jellies.

06:15.609 --> 06:17.611
They made me breastfeed
some old man.

06:17.611 --> 06:18.912
That's what I'm talking about.

06:18.912 --> 06:20.881
But we don't have
to take it, Stacey.

06:20.881 --> 06:22.916
Like Henry David Thoreau
and Rosa Parks

06:22.916 --> 06:25.385
and David Lee Roth
when he left Van Halen,

06:25.385 --> 06:28.055
we can say, "Enough.
Enough injustice."

06:28.055 --> 06:31.191
And when you and I
are old and gray,
we can look back on this

06:31.191 --> 06:34.695
and remember when
we were 30,000 feet
above God's green earth,

06:34.695 --> 06:39.299
and we smoked one,
we smoked one for America.

06:39.299 --> 06:40.834
(ALL CHEERING)
Yeah.

06:47.107 --> 06:48.942
You motherfucker.

06:49.877 --> 06:51.512
MAN: Nice work. Nice work.

06:52.480 --> 06:53.881
Who are you?

06:53.881 --> 06:58.085
I'm Don Ready,
and I got the goods.

07:03.356 --> 07:05.493
This is some killer kush.

07:09.329 --> 07:14.334
Nun pops her head out
and says, "Shit.
Guess I got to gargle."

07:14.334 --> 07:16.336
(ALL LAUGHING)

07:16.336 --> 07:20.874
Poor Don. It's like everything
he does is to make him
forget about 'Querque.

07:20.874 --> 07:24.812
Takes a lot of pain
to sell cars the way
that man does.

07:28.649 --> 07:31.652
(DIRTY RED PLAYING)

07:34.021 --> 07:38.759

what's your name?

* "I heard about you
and all your little
itty-bitty games" *

You're here from
Selleck Motors?

07:49.069 --> 07:50.738
No, but my dad is.

07:50.738 --> 07:53.040
You're supposed to put the name
of the party you're picking up,

07:53.040 --> 07:55.042
not your own.
I love the drawing, though.

07:55.042 --> 07:57.244
Yeah, I'm a really
good drawer.

07:57.244 --> 07:59.212
I like to draw stomach
muscles the most.

07:59.212 --> 08:02.983
I can also draw
Darth Vader's helmet.
I can also draw him.

08:02.983 --> 08:07.254
I can draw a saber,
a lightsaber or
a regular sword.

08:07.254 --> 08:08.722
It doesn't even matter.

08:08.722 --> 08:12.092
What the fuck is wrong
with you? Are you drunk?

08:12.092 --> 08:15.262
Are you retarded?
Because we're here
to help you.

08:15.262 --> 08:20.834
Don't move. Dad,
Amber Alert! Adult!

08:20.834 --> 08:24.838
Stranger danger!
Stranger danger! Dad!

08:24.838 --> 08:27.407
Here, relax, Peter,
okay? Take a swig.

08:27.407 --> 08:30.778
It looks like it
wasn't the fax ink.
He's some sort of man-child.

08:30.778 --> 08:32.746
It's a pituitary problem,
ma'am.

08:32.746 --> 08:36.449
He's 10, in the developing
body of an adult.

08:36.449 --> 08:40.520
I'm sorry, buddy.
I am totally sorry.
Put it up here. High five.

08:40.520 --> 08:43.256
Good effort there.
You must be Ben.
I'm Don Ready.

08:43.256 --> 08:45.458
BEN: That's me.
And this must be Ivy.

08:45.458 --> 08:50.898
Wow! Can I ask you a quick
question? How much does
a polar bear weigh?

08:50.898 --> 08:52.833
No idea.
Enough to break the ice.

08:52.833 --> 08:54.668
Don Ready. How are you?
Wow.

08:54.668 --> 08:56.503
Went old-school with you.
Impressive.

08:56.503 --> 09:00.841
I'm Babs. And, yes,
the rug matches the drapes.

is Jibby.

09:03.376 --> 09:04.712
Hi.
What's up?

09:04.712 --> 09:06.246
And who is this guy?

09:06.246 --> 09:08.448
Well, you are
a strapping young man.

09:08.448 --> 09:09.683
Brent Gage, sir.

09:09.683 --> 09:12.452
Brent Gage, now that
is a strong name.

09:12.452 --> 09:16.690
I don't know why,
but right off the bat,
I like you a lot.

09:17.557 --> 09:19.126
What's going on?

09:19.126 --> 09:21.595
Peter, let's help the crew
with their luggage.

09:29.703 --> 09:31.104
I'd fuck him.

09:31.104 --> 09:34.107
Hey, what is wrong with you,
lady? He is a child.

09:34.107 --> 09:35.743
We're only gonna be here
for three days,

09:35.743 --> 09:37.077
so try not to fall
in love with me.

09:37.077 --> 09:38.879
I'm sorry, has a girl
ever bought that?

09:38.879 --> 09:40.413
I'm just, you know,
buckshot approach.

09:40.413 --> 09:42.382
I'm just gonna keep firing
till I hit something.

09:42.382 --> 09:43.951
(LAUGHING)
Oh, that's delightful.

09:45.352 --> 09:48.856
So, there was a kid up
the street, Chris Bamberger,

09:48.856 --> 09:52.793
had one of those brand-new,
tricked out Krazy Kruisers.

09:52.793 --> 09:55.663
Side brakes, streamers off
the handle grips.

09:55.663 --> 09:57.464
In other words, fully loaded.

09:57.464 --> 09:59.466
What am I driving?

09:59.466 --> 10:01.869
A fucking Hoppity Hip.

10:01.869 --> 10:04.604
Basically a balloon
with a handle on it.

10:04.604 --> 10:06.907
It might as well have had
a bumper sticker on
the back that said,

10:06.907 --> 10:08.642
"My parents don't work."

10:08.642 --> 10:12.880
So I walk up to him,
hop up to him.
I introduce myself,

10:12.880 --> 10:15.215
and I say,
"You seem like a cool guy."

10:15.215 --> 10:17.017
"Why don't you
have a Hoppity Hip?"

10:17.017 --> 10:20.353
You know? I tell him
it's faster, it's cooler.

10:20.353 --> 10:24.658
It's got the finger-molded
hand grip, double-enforced
bouncing axis.

10:24.658 --> 10:28.729
I work this kid like
a pro. Walked him
through the brochures.

10:28.729 --> 10:30.630
Offered him
a bubble gum cigarette.

10:30.630 --> 10:34.101
Even threw in
some night crawlers
to sweeten the deal.

10:34.101 --> 10:36.136
Bottom line is,
this kid was actually happy

10:36.136 --> 10:38.105
to bounce around
on the balloon,

10:38.105 --> 10:43.043
while I rode away
on his brand-new,
tricked-out chopper.

10:44.211 --> 10:47.080
I like to think that
was my first sale.

11:02.129 --> 11:03.797
Right over there
is Selleck Motors.

11:03.797 --> 11:07.067
I thought you might
want to take a look.

11:10.237 --> 11:13.974
BRENT: Jesus, Ben,
looks like a refugee
camp for dirty men.

11:15.275 --> 11:17.978
Looks like the bus station
in Total Recall.

11:20.213 --> 11:21.949
We're gonna fix
your place up, Ben.

11:21.949 --> 11:23.917
We're gonna get you
a Creatable Inflatable,

11:23.917 --> 11:26.787
goddamn American flag,
balloons, all that shit.

11:26.787 --> 11:28.856
Plus, we need a radio
and TV blitz,

11:28.856 --> 11:31.925
and we're gonna need to
round up a celebrity to
make a lot appearance.

11:31.925 --> 11:33.293
I know just who to call.

11:33.293 --> 11:36.096
Now, let's hit
the Hacienda Courts,

11:36.096 --> 11:38.398
or as I like to call it, home.

11:56.616 --> 12:01.154
BRENT: I mean, I paid for it.
It'd be disrespectful
not to masturbate.

12:03.323 --> 12:07.594
BABS: All right, let's keep
this anonymous. Don't look
at me. Don't look at me.

12:07.594 --> 12:09.162
Don't even...
Don't you look at me.

12:10.730 --> 12:12.265
JIBBY: Yeah!

12:12.265 --> 12:13.533
Dawson's Creek.

12:13.533 --> 12:16.069
James Van Der Beek, my nigger.

12:16.970 --> 12:19.639
(PETER MAKING ROBOT SOUNDS)

12:19.639 --> 12:23.143
Okay, Peter,
it's time to go sit
in your big chair.

12:25.045 --> 12:27.614
Now, everybody dig in.
Don't be shy.

12:27.614 --> 12:29.082
DON: I'm sorry, Mrs. Selleck.

12:29.082 --> 12:31.051
I'm one of those rare birds
that prefers takeout

12:31.051 --> 12:32.786
over a home-cooked meal.

12:32.786 --> 12:35.155
Ah!
Well, I got to tell you, Don,

12:35.155 --> 12:37.357
that is flat-out
weird and rude.

12:37.357 --> 12:39.426
But you do what
you need to do.

12:39.426 --> 12:44.197
You know, Mr. Don Ready,
our Ivy here actually
left graduate school

12:44.197 --> 12:46.599
to come back and help us out
with little Peter.

12:46.599 --> 12:48.501
DON: Wow.
That's the kind of girl she is.

12:48.501 --> 12:51.571
You can take the girl
out of Temecula, but...

12:51.571 --> 12:53.606
Hey, Brent.

12:53.606 --> 12:56.143
You see my wife over there?

12:56.143 --> 12:58.045
Yeah.
(LAUGHING)

12:58.045 --> 13:01.148
It is a dead marriage.

13:01.148 --> 13:03.350
But, you know,
you learn to live with it.

13:03.350 --> 13:10.223
You drive around,
out at night,
windows down, music up.

13:11.158 --> 13:14.027
Some people call it cruising.

13:14.027 --> 13:18.065
Me, I call it looking
for a friend.

13:18.065 --> 13:19.566
Are you my friend, Brent?

13:19.566 --> 13:20.733
No.

13:20.733 --> 13:22.269
So tomorrow morning,

13:22.269 --> 13:24.171
our troops will rendezvous
with your troops at 0700,

13:24.171 --> 13:26.706
and then I'll hit the floor
for my intro speech,

13:26.706 --> 13:29.009
like a mountain lion pouncing
on an unsuspecting jogger.

13:29.009 --> 13:31.078
Ooh!
Make sure your underwear

13:31.078 --> 13:33.914
is tight tomorrow,
because you will have a boner.

13:33.914 --> 13:35.382
(EXCLAIMING)

13:37.184 --> 13:38.618
Amen.

13:38.618 --> 13:41.588
I like the sound of that.
Right, Brent?

13:41.588 --> 13:44.424
By Tuesday, my friend,
you are back in the black.

13:44.424 --> 13:45.893
Well, hear, hear.

13:45.893 --> 13:47.427
Okay, Mr. Ready,

13:47.427 --> 13:49.963
this business has been in
our family for 40 years,

13:49.963 --> 13:51.798
so no sleazy stuff, okay?

13:51.798 --> 13:53.500
Don't worry about it, darling.
We're not gonna break the rules.

13:53.500 --> 13:55.368
We're just gonna bend them
a little bit.

13:55.368 --> 13:57.938
Okay, okay. I just...
I know your type.

13:57.938 --> 14:01.208
You know, it's all the thrill
of the hunt. I get it.

14:01.208 --> 14:04.277
I mean, you crave it.
You corner it.

14:04.277 --> 14:06.546
But, Mr. Ready,
let me ask you a question.

14:06.546 --> 14:08.916
Do you know what to do
when you catch it?

14:13.220 --> 14:14.621
Are we talking about pussy?

14:14.621 --> 14:16.389
(COUGHING)
TAMMY: Oh, my stars. You didn't.

14:16.389 --> 14:18.458
That's what she was saying.
TAMMY: Oh, my goodness!

14:18.458 --> 14:20.827
I'm sorry, I apologize.
I'm a Christian man,

14:20.827 --> 14:23.296
or whatever religion dominates
the region that I'm selling in,

14:23.296 --> 14:24.797
but you have to admit,
it did sound like

14:24.797 --> 14:27.300
she was talking about
the big vajayjay, right?

14:27.300 --> 14:28.368
Didn't it?
JIBBY: Amen.

14:28.368 --> 14:30.270
I guess it kind of did. Yeah.

14:32.472 --> 14:33.706
Hey, come on, man.

14:33.706 --> 14:37.144
Jibby was a pro bowler
for two years on the tour.

14:37.144 --> 14:38.511
Got a lot of great stories.

14:38.511 --> 14:41.748
Well, what can I say?
It was the go-go '80s,

14:41.748 --> 14:47.454
the height of professional
bowling, girls, limos,
wristbands.

14:47.454 --> 14:51.258
Ivy, I think you got
the wrong impression
of me earlier.

14:51.258 --> 14:53.360
I'm a really sensitive
person, all right?

14:53.360 --> 14:56.663
For instance, I'm not
a texter. I'd rather
hear your voice, you know.

14:56.663 --> 14:58.798
Hey, everybody,
I'm Ivy's fiance.

14:58.798 --> 15:00.433
TAMMY: Look who's here.

15:00.433 --> 15:03.370
Paxton, such a weird thing to
say when you enter a room.

15:03.370 --> 15:05.705
Well, I'm just letting
everybody know the deal.

15:05.705 --> 15:09.242
Well, I am Paxton Harding
of Harding Imports.

15:09.242 --> 15:14.647
And you must be the guys
who are going to save
Ben Selleck Motors.

15:14.647 --> 15:16.249
Yeah. That's the idea.

15:16.249 --> 15:18.818
I didn't catch
your name, friend.

15:18.818 --> 15:21.321
That's because
I didn't give it
to you, friend.

15:21.321 --> 15:25.725
Mmm. Well, a couple of friends
ought to know each other's
names, right?

15:25.725 --> 15:28.028
My name's Don Ready.

15:28.028 --> 15:30.930
All right. I guess I won that
little exchange.

15:30.930 --> 15:32.665
You fell for it.

15:32.665 --> 15:35.168
In fact, let me be the first
to tell you guys, good luck.

15:35.168 --> 15:37.904
Everyone at Harding Imports
and every dealership
in this town

15:37.904 --> 15:39.372
is rooting for you guys.

15:39.372 --> 15:43.043
You got a Harding guarantee
on that. I swear to God.

15:43.043 --> 15:45.212
I'm off to rehearsal.

15:45.212 --> 15:48.215
All right? I want to give
my two ladies a kiss
on the cheek.

15:49.649 --> 15:51.084
You are so sweet.

15:51.084 --> 15:52.419
You know, Paxton here

15:52.419 --> 15:55.022
is in one of those popular bands
in Temecula,

15:55.022 --> 15:56.289
Balls Out.

15:56.289 --> 15:57.890
No, Big Ups.
Big Ups. Sorry.

15:57.890 --> 15:59.526
Either way.

15:59.526 --> 16:01.228
(ALL LAUGHING)

16:01.228 --> 16:02.629
Big Ups is the name
of the band.

16:02.629 --> 16:04.397
It's me and Ricky
and Jason, and we...

16:04.397 --> 16:06.299
You know, we sing about life
and love and passion,

16:06.299 --> 16:10.970
and I'm not gonna lie
to you, we have some
pretty sick dance moves.

16:10.970 --> 16:12.772
Are you in a boy band?

16:12.772 --> 16:14.474
No, I'm in a man band.

16:14.474 --> 16:16.276
We're all over 30,
we call it a man band.

16:16.276 --> 16:18.478
You're men in a boy band.

16:18.478 --> 16:21.081
We opened for O-Town,
right here in Temecula, okay?

16:21.081 --> 16:22.849
Google it.
No.

16:22.849 --> 16:24.617
Google it.
No.

16:24.617 --> 16:26.519
Why wouldn't you google it?
I just told you to google it.

16:26.519 --> 16:28.688
Google "Big Ups."
You know, I googled it.

16:28.688 --> 16:29.922
It said you fucking blow.

16:29.922 --> 16:31.324
(ALL LAUGHING)

16:31.324 --> 16:33.226
That was O-Town's website.

16:33.226 --> 16:36.763
You know what?
I'm rising above this.

16:36.763 --> 16:41.101
While you guys are yukking
it up, I'm gonna go
rehearse with Big Ups.

16:41.101 --> 16:43.403
Ricky and Jason are
in the car. Let's go.

16:43.403 --> 16:45.572
All right, bye-bye.
See you all tomorrow.

16:45.572 --> 16:47.074
JIBBY: Man, that dude
is garbage.

16:47.074 --> 16:49.442
(BRENT EXCLAIMS)
BRENT: What a jerk.

16:49.442 --> 16:51.511
Who wants a big
hunk of this meat, hmm?

16:56.149 --> 16:58.385
Hey, guys.

16:58.385 --> 17:00.587
A couple guys came in here
earlier looking for Vanessa,

17:00.587 --> 17:02.989
and I got a little bit
of bad news for you,
Vanessa is dead.

17:02.989 --> 17:04.824
Here's Radio Moscow.

17:04.824 --> 17:08.027
It's funny, I haven't been in
Temecula in, what, 23 years.

17:08.027 --> 17:09.696
Last time I was here,

17:09.696 --> 17:13.133
I spent two straight days
in a Hacienda Courts

17:13.133 --> 17:15.768
with the third runner-up
to Miss Temecula.

17:15.768 --> 17:17.137
Never saw her again.

17:17.137 --> 17:19.206
Hey, what do you make
of this Selleck guy?

17:19.206 --> 17:20.840
I got to be honest with you,

17:20.840 --> 17:23.610
have you noticed him saying
overtly sexual things to me?

17:23.610 --> 17:24.811
Touching me?

17:24.811 --> 17:26.179
I haven't.

17:27.147 --> 17:28.848
Oh! That is disgusting.

17:28.848 --> 17:31.751
But don't get me wrong,
I have an erection.

17:31.751 --> 17:33.153
Babs?
Mmm-hmm.

17:33.153 --> 17:36.256
Can I tell you a deep,
dark secret

17:36.256 --> 17:38.191
I ain't never
told anyone before?

17:38.191 --> 17:41.361
Baby, I really would rather
you not. I'm tired.

17:41.361 --> 17:43.430
I'm 42 years old,

17:44.831 --> 17:48.768
and I ain't never, ever
made love to a woman.

17:48.768 --> 17:49.969
You're a virgin?

17:49.969 --> 17:51.371
Hell, no.
Oh.

17:51.371 --> 17:53.106
No, I've been with hundreds
of women,

17:53.106 --> 17:54.707
maybe thousands.

17:54.707 --> 17:58.178
I just ain't never really
ever made love to a woman.

17:58.178 --> 18:01.281
You know, I've done
three ways, four ways,

18:01.281 --> 18:04.217
menage a trois,
menage cinq, six.

18:04.217 --> 18:09.422
I've 69ed, 89ed, 114ed.

18:09.422 --> 18:13.560
Golden, diamond and platinum
showers. I like that.

18:13.560 --> 18:16.463
I mean, I've ripped shit up.

18:17.764 --> 18:19.199
Done all that.

18:20.833 --> 18:24.137
But I ain't never, ever
made love to a woman.

18:24.137 --> 18:26.606
You will, Jibby.

18:26.606 --> 18:29.609
As long as we're being honest,

18:29.609 --> 18:31.978
I've something I want
to share with you.

18:31.978 --> 18:35.548
I think I want to make love
to a 10-year-old boy.

18:35.548 --> 18:37.317
What?

18:37.317 --> 18:38.951
But he's in the body
of a 30-year-old man,

18:38.951 --> 18:40.487
so who's to blame?

18:40.487 --> 18:42.989
You the adult.
Right.

18:42.989 --> 18:45.425
You'd be the one to blame.

18:47.927 --> 18:49.396
BRENT: Hey, Babs. Hey, Jibby.

18:49.396 --> 18:51.631
Hey, Don, there are three
hot dancers over there.

18:51.631 --> 18:53.466
I think they might
be good for the sale.

18:53.466 --> 18:56.369
Yeah, sign them up. Good energy,
make the customers happy.

18:56.369 --> 18:58.605
Hey, guys, get those food
orders in quickly,

18:58.605 --> 19:02.409
'cause in 25 minutes
the kitchen is rented
out for a porno shoot.

19:02.409 --> 19:05.111
Are you disgusted? I am.

19:05.111 --> 19:06.479
Book the DJ.

19:07.947 --> 19:10.116
You sure, Don? I just thought
after 'Querque...

19:10.116 --> 19:12.785
Hey. 'Querque was 'Querque.
This is this.

19:12.785 --> 19:15.922
It's time for all of us to move
on, all right?

19:15.922 --> 19:18.191
And it starts
with booking that DJ.

19:25.164 --> 19:28.268
Where is he? I even wore
my tight underwear
for the boner speech.

19:28.268 --> 19:30.370
Just relax, honey.
He's getting ready.

19:30.370 --> 19:33.139
As for the underwear,
I think it was
just an expression.

19:33.139 --> 19:34.507
Look, I may be old-fashioned,

19:34.507 --> 19:35.975
but the man says,
"Wear your boner pants,"

19:35.975 --> 19:37.610
I wear my boner pants.

19:39.178 --> 19:41.281
You can do this.
You are a winner.

19:41.281 --> 19:42.949
Don Ready has
the heart of a champion.

19:42.949 --> 19:44.484
I'm a fucking stallion.

19:44.484 --> 19:46.386
I should be owned by a
goddamn Middle Eastern sheikh.

19:46.386 --> 19:49.989
There's almost no doubt
you invented the phrase,
"It's all good."

19:49.989 --> 19:53.860
In the schoolyard, a Don Ready
is a euphemism for a hard-on.

19:53.860 --> 19:56.863
All right, fellas,
everybody gather around.

19:58.431 --> 20:00.867
Now, you all know the deal.
Over the next few days,

20:00.867 --> 20:03.836
Don Ready and his team
will be overseeing sales.

20:03.836 --> 20:07.006
Basically, they will be
your boss for the weekend.

20:07.006 --> 20:11.644
Now, I trust them.
And if you trust them,
together we will sell cars.

20:11.644 --> 20:14.347
You were the first person
to wear a Von Dutch trucker hat.

20:14.347 --> 20:15.848
I really regret that.

20:15.848 --> 20:17.183
As well you should.

20:17.183 --> 20:20.320
Mmm. Look at my husband.
Looks like he's got a Don Ready.

20:20.320 --> 20:22.221
Give me a minute.

20:28.561 --> 20:32.031
I'm Babs Merrick.
I'm gonna tell you
people a little story.

20:32.031 --> 20:36.369
A story about a girl who
grew up in the worst part
of the South Bronx.

20:36.369 --> 20:41.408
Well, one day,
this little girl fell in love
with a boxer named Winston.

20:41.408 --> 20:44.844
But their love was
too good to last,

20:46.045 --> 20:47.880
and one day, the Vice Lords
came a-calling,

20:47.880 --> 20:53.019
saying, "Winston,
it's time to take a dive."

20:53.019 --> 20:55.955
Coroner found two bullets
in his heart.

20:55.955 --> 20:59.025
One of them was meant
for this little girl.

20:59.025 --> 21:03.396
* It's a hard world, mama
You got to push on through

21:03.396 --> 21:05.197
* 'Cause life in the ghetto *

21:05.197 --> 21:09.135
Well, everyone told this
little girl to shut her
mouth and go away.

21:09.135 --> 21:11.604
But she didn't do that.

21:11.604 --> 21:14.273
She made sure every
single one of those
pieces of human trash

21:14.273 --> 21:15.975
looked her straight
in the eye

21:15.975 --> 21:19.412
before she pulled the trigger
on that platinum .357 Magnum.

21:19.412 --> 21:20.880
Jose!

21:20.880 --> 21:22.148
Pop!

21:22.148 --> 21:24.651
Ramon! Pop! Pop! Pop!

21:24.651 --> 21:27.320
* It ain't easy *

21:27.320 --> 21:30.790
I got to tell
you people, on TV,

21:30.790 --> 21:34.093
they don't show the dead man
when the poop leaves the butt.

21:34.093 --> 21:38.465
Make no mistake, gentlemen,

21:38.465 --> 21:43.603
when you die, poop
leaves your butt.

21:44.671 --> 21:47.740
Man. That is a dark story.

21:47.740 --> 21:51.444
I know. I made it up.
Have a great sale, everybody.

21:51.444 --> 21:52.712
SALESMAN: What?
Great sale.

21:52.712 --> 21:54.914
JIBBY: * It ain't easy *

21:54.914 --> 21:58.017
It ain't easy.
I'm Brent Gage.

21:58.017 --> 22:02.121
They call me The Magician.
I am a wizard with numbers.

22:02.121 --> 22:07.494
I have never, never lost
a sale to bad credit.

22:07.494 --> 22:10.530
Quick story.
A couple years ago,
MC Hammer, remember him?

22:10.530 --> 22:13.065
He was in bankruptcy,
living on the street,

22:13.065 --> 22:15.502
sleeping in the left leg
of his Hammer pants.

22:15.502 --> 22:17.704
The next day,

22:17.704 --> 22:20.840
I financed that man a car,
no questions asked.

22:20.840 --> 22:24.577
Hammer lived in that car
for the next year and a half.

22:24.577 --> 22:26.613
So you guys are
just taking over?

22:26.613 --> 22:30.483
With your cool nicknames
and your confidence?

22:30.483 --> 22:31.884
I mean, how are we
supposed to feel?

22:31.884 --> 22:34.521
Yeah, what about our sales?
Our commissions?

22:34.521 --> 22:35.888
DON: It's all good.

22:36.889 --> 22:38.591
I'm Don "The Goods" Ready.

22:38.591 --> 22:41.260
Everyone here told you
their story. Here's mine.

22:41.260 --> 22:46.466
I have hair on my balls
and I sell cars. The end.

22:46.466 --> 22:51.370
All right. Today,
tomorrow, Monday.

22:51.370 --> 22:56.075
It's July 4th weekend,
everybody, and we're
going to war, all right?

22:56.075 --> 22:58.645
When you guys are
deep in the shit,

22:58.645 --> 23:02.348
I want you to think
about the real heroes
of this Independence Day.

23:02.348 --> 23:06.819
The Revolutionary War soldier
who had his
gangrene foot sawed off,

23:06.819 --> 23:09.956
with nothing to numb the pain
except a shot of whiskey

23:09.956 --> 23:13.426
and that guy with
the weird headband
playing the flute.

23:13.426 --> 23:18.330
What about
Private Jones, huh?
Seventeen-year-old soldier.

23:18.330 --> 23:22.869
Got his guts shot out
in a 'Nam rice paddy.
All right?

23:22.869 --> 23:24.704
Dick here knows
what I'm talking about.

23:24.704 --> 23:28.441
He's talking about freedom,
you fucking queers!

23:30.176 --> 23:33.212
Don't even get me started
on Pearl Harbor.

23:33.212 --> 23:36.315
Our Navy boys out there
enjoying the bright
Hawaiian sun,

23:36.315 --> 23:41.420
when all of a sudden,
here comes the Japs
flying in low and fast.

23:41.420 --> 23:46.058
This dealership
is our battlefield.
Don't give up the fight.

23:46.058 --> 23:50.963
We are the Americans,
and they are the enemy.
Never again.

23:50.963 --> 23:52.999
Never again.

23:52.999 --> 23:54.734
Never again!

23:54.734 --> 23:58.037
ALL: Never again! Never again!

23:58.037 --> 24:01.307
Never again!
Let's get him!

SALESMAN: Eat my shit!

24:05.211 --> 24:07.279
(GROWLING)

24:07.279 --> 24:09.015
Dad, don't you think
you should step in?

24:09.015 --> 24:12.118
No, he can take it.
He's squirrelly.

24:12.118 --> 24:13.886
Stop! All right, stop!

24:13.886 --> 24:15.622
Everyone, calm down!
Put him down, Jibby.

24:15.622 --> 24:17.223
(WHIMPERING)

24:17.223 --> 24:19.291
Okay, we have all just

24:19.291 --> 24:21.661
participated in a hate crime.

24:21.661 --> 24:24.931
Was it a hate crime
or a freedom crime?

24:24.931 --> 24:27.133
All right, everyone, just calm
down. Bottom line,

24:27.133 --> 24:29.135
we have all just committed
a federal offense.

24:29.135 --> 24:33.506
Which means that G-men
are gonna be crawling
all over this lot.

24:33.506 --> 24:36.743
Let's get our story straight.

24:36.743 --> 24:40.012
Dang came at us
with a samurai sword,

24:40.012 --> 24:43.415
fire extinguisher,
and Chinese throwing stars.

24:43.415 --> 24:45.217
ALL: Yeah.
That seems plausible.

24:45.217 --> 24:47.019
No, I did not.
No, I did not. I...

24:47.019 --> 24:50.156
We got to get a sword
and get his prints on it.

24:50.156 --> 24:51.891
TEDDY: There was no weaponry
of any kind!

24:51.891 --> 24:53.793
Okay, Dang, how about this?

24:53.793 --> 24:55.728
You get first dibs
on customer ups.

24:55.728 --> 24:57.930
In return, you agree to forget
all about

24:57.930 --> 25:00.232
being the victim
of a hate crime.

25:01.534 --> 25:02.935
Okay.

25:02.935 --> 25:05.304
That's it, Dang.
That's the guy we love.

25:05.304 --> 25:08.207
Thank you, Mr. Selleck.
I'm really sorry.

25:08.207 --> 25:10.442
I'm not even Japanese.
I'm Korean.

25:10.442 --> 25:12.444
Korean? Why didn't you say so?

25:12.444 --> 25:16.549
On that note, let's man
those battle stations,
everybody, all right?

25:16.549 --> 25:18.084
Never again.

25:18.084 --> 25:20.386
We got one hour. Let's get this
place in shape.

25:20.386 --> 25:23.923
(STRAIGHT AHEAD PLAYING)

25:32.431 --> 25:36.135
Really simple, boys. If you
take this six, you flip it,
that's the price.

25:36.135 --> 25:38.004
You know what you
can do with this?

25:38.004 --> 25:41.373
You can take this
and turn it into
that if you want.

25:41.373 --> 25:45.912
You've taken $3,000 off
this car. It's back down
to your original price.

25:45.912 --> 25:48.480
Zooha, to sell you must...

25:48.480 --> 25:50.850
Confine, confuse, conflict.

25:50.850 --> 25:54.386
Nice! Teddy Dang,
to close, you must...

25:54.386 --> 25:57.223
Lie, loan, leave.

25:57.223 --> 26:00.526
Nice. Mr. Dick Lewiston?

26:00.526 --> 26:03.930
Go fuck yourself,
you bald-headed
son of a bitch.

26:03.930 --> 26:06.332
I've seen more hair on bacon.

26:06.332 --> 26:07.900
Good enough.

26:07.900 --> 26:10.102
DON: Wow, you must be
the girls from the strip club.

26:10.102 --> 26:11.904
Yes. Heather.
Hey, Heather. How are you?

26:11.904 --> 26:13.172
Your job is to greet people,

26:13.172 --> 26:14.707
get them in the buying mood,
okay?

26:14.707 --> 26:16.208
I have an idea.
Sure.

26:16.208 --> 26:17.944
Since it's July 4th,
I thought it'd be good

26:17.944 --> 26:20.079
to talk to the customers
about how this government

26:20.079 --> 26:21.981
has been cutting
benefits for veterans.

26:21.981 --> 26:24.250
Let me guess,
you are dancing to pay for

26:24.250 --> 26:25.885

in Political Science.

26:25.885 --> 26:28.087
Yes. How did you know?
I don't know.

26:28.087 --> 26:29.756
Stripper stories,
they usually come in three,

26:29.756 --> 26:31.523
college student,
single mom, cokehead.

26:31.523 --> 26:33.392
What's your son's name?

26:33.392 --> 26:35.695
I'm kidding. I don't even know
what I'm saying. I'm bananas.

You guys are
doing an amazing job.

26:37.964 --> 26:40.700
Sapphire, wipe
your nose. God.

26:40.700 --> 26:43.703
All right, we gonna be selling
some cars today.

26:43.703 --> 26:45.204
(LAUGHING)

26:45.204 --> 26:47.840
And tomorrow, you know who
we got coming in? I do.

26:47.840 --> 26:53.379
American Idol's very own Bo
Bice's brother is coming down.

26:53.379 --> 26:56.215
Yes. Eric Bice will be right
here, rocking the stage.

26:56.215 --> 26:58.951
Hey, DJ. This place
is about to pop.

26:58.951 --> 27:01.287
Why don't you throw on
some Charlie Daniels?

Good call.

* Tits
* You know I love it

let me touch it?

27:06.392 --> 27:08.861
* Tits
* Put 'em in my face

27:08.861 --> 27:10.262
* Bounce 'em to the bass *

27:10.262 --> 27:12.631
Nobody tells DJ Request
what to play.

27:12.631 --> 27:15.401
Let them tell you
what to play, they
lose respect for you.

27:15.401 --> 27:19.105
They lose respect for you,
you lose control.

27:19.105 --> 27:20.339
Not today.

27:22.775 --> 27:23.976
All right.

27:23.976 --> 27:25.778
You want to thumb wrestle?

27:25.778 --> 27:27.146
Yeah, I'm awesome.

27:28.580 --> 27:31.083
Oh! You won.
I totally beat you.

27:31.083 --> 27:32.618
Oh, what are you
gonna do to me now?

27:32.618 --> 27:33.853
What?

27:33.853 --> 27:36.388
You better spank
me or something.

27:36.388 --> 27:39.525
Babs! He's 10.

27:39.525 --> 27:40.760
Ten and a half.

27:40.760 --> 27:42.428
Do you hear that, Ready?
Ten and a half.

27:45.664 --> 27:47.633
Brent. Those are my kids.

27:47.633 --> 27:50.737
Yeah. And probably a good reason
you're not selling.

27:50.737 --> 27:52.338
What are you talking about?

27:52.338 --> 27:54.907
Zooha, let's face it.
You've got husky kids.

27:54.907 --> 27:56.508
I know it, you know it,

27:56.508 --> 27:59.078
and every Chuck E. Cheese
in a 50-mile radius knows it.

27:59.078 --> 28:01.113
You know who doesn't need
to know it? The customer.

28:01.113 --> 28:03.249
I don't understand.

28:03.249 --> 28:05.451
Look, you put up
a picture of skinny kids.

28:05.451 --> 28:09.088
Customer thinks, "Oh, my lord,
this guy needs the commission.

28:09.088 --> 28:10.823
"He's got to feed
those hungry mouths."

28:10.823 --> 28:13.760
Oh! Okay. I get it. I get it.

28:13.760 --> 28:15.094
Should I take down
the picture of my wife?

28:15.094 --> 28:17.129
No, that's your closer.

28:17.129 --> 28:22.034
Fat kids, customer
hates you. Fat wife,
customer pities you.

28:22.034 --> 28:26.605
Shit, Zooha. That's the best
fat wife I've seen
in four or five years.

28:26.605 --> 28:27.974
Can I have a copy of it?

28:30.409 --> 28:32.278
Nice balloons.

28:32.278 --> 28:34.847
Wow, that line must have
knocked them dead
in the frat house.

28:34.847 --> 28:36.215
Come on, I'm just trying
to have some fun.

28:36.215 --> 28:37.917
So, you pumped
for the big day?

28:37.917 --> 28:39.585
Yeah, it should be great.

28:39.585 --> 28:42.121
They say you sell some cars.
Let's see you sell some cars.

28:42.121 --> 28:44.523
No, no, I'm not talking about
the sale. I'm talking
about your wedding.

28:44.523 --> 28:49.161
Excited to spend
the next 60 years
of your life with...

28:51.030 --> 28:52.398

28:55.734 --> 28:58.170
Oh, now, now.

28:58.170 --> 29:01.240
All right, what about you?
You have any relationships

29:01.240 --> 29:03.209
that last longer
than a lap dance?

29:03.209 --> 29:05.444
Have you seen what these
girls do these days?

29:05.444 --> 29:09.281
I mean, we are living
in the golden age
of lap dances.

29:09.281 --> 29:11.050
Wow, that has got
to be tiring.

29:11.050 --> 29:12.919
No.
You don't want a home life?

29:12.919 --> 29:16.188
You don't want to
live for somebody
other than yourself?

29:16.188 --> 29:19.291
No time. I'm on the road
51.5 weeks a year,

29:19.291 --> 29:23.996
and I like myself a lot.
I'm having a blast.

29:26.065 --> 29:28.935
You know what?
I don't believe you.

29:41.914 --> 29:44.050
(PEOPLE CLAMORING)

29:44.050 --> 29:45.451
Look at them.

29:45.451 --> 29:49.321
They're like crazy
boat people. I love it.

29:53.926 --> 29:57.229
Give away free hot dogs
and put up
an inflatable gorilla,

29:57.229 --> 29:59.498

I feel exactly like I did
before I landed on Iwo Jima,
I swear to God.

leaving the body.

What did you say to her?

Shut the fuck up.

themselves on the line.

Capitalism, it's my high.

31:52.144 --> 31:55.414
I haven't seen the lot
like this since I brought
in the Bandit Car.

31:55.414 --> 31:57.449
You know, rumor is that
that car is one of the cars

31:57.449 --> 31:59.318
that was in
Smokey and the Bandit.

31:59.318 --> 32:01.687
That weekend this
place was hopping.

32:01.687 --> 32:03.822
I was thinking we should get
that out of here, you know.

32:03.822 --> 32:05.157
It's bad for business.

32:05.157 --> 32:06.993
No, that car
is a collector's car.

32:06.993 --> 32:09.795
That's worth $200,000,
won't take a cent less.

32:09.795 --> 32:14.967
But in this Auto Lister,
they have the same exact
car for $1,000 less.

32:14.967 --> 32:17.603
Wow. What a great deal.

32:17.603 --> 32:19.538
Excuse me, can I see that?
Sure.

32:20.572 --> 32:22.208
My, my.

32:22.208 --> 32:24.343
If you can get this
car for 1,000 less,

32:24.343 --> 32:26.212
you should definitely buy.

32:26.212 --> 32:28.847
In fact, let me call.

32:28.847 --> 32:30.382
Thank you.

32:31.517 --> 32:32.851
Here you go.

32:32.851 --> 32:34.320
Thanks.

32:34.320 --> 32:35.954
MAN WITH DEEP VOICE: Hello?

32:35.954 --> 32:38.657
Hi, I'm calling about the car
you have advertised.

32:38.657 --> 32:41.093
Can we get a drink?

32:41.093 --> 32:43.262
No, I don't want
to go for a drink.

32:43.262 --> 32:45.364
Yeah, I can put you in my truck.
We can drive around.

32:45.364 --> 32:46.832
You can see how it handles.

32:46.832 --> 32:48.267
Maybe go to the reservoir.

32:48.267 --> 32:51.437
Excuse me? I...
Put the lotion in the basket.

32:51.437 --> 32:53.539
Put the lotion in
the fucking basket.

32:53.539 --> 32:55.207
Oh, my God.

32:55.207 --> 32:57.476
See, I try to tell
women all the time.

32:57.476 --> 33:00.446
Auto Lister's like MySpace
for serial killers.

33:00.446 --> 33:04.416
I don't want to see another
one of these on this lot.

33:06.385 --> 33:09.621
I think I'll just take
this car right over here.

33:09.621 --> 33:10.989
(BELL RINGS)

33:10.989 --> 33:15.227
Okay, here's the deal, Gary.
I know the stereotype.

33:15.227 --> 33:18.097
I'm a woman, got a luscious
body, provocative clothes.

33:18.097 --> 33:19.765
I'm gonna use
sex to sell cars.

33:19.765 --> 33:22.368
You know what's gonna sell this
car? Price, nothing else.

33:22.368 --> 33:24.570
I mean, I like men.

33:24.570 --> 33:26.372
I like men a lot.

33:27.939 --> 33:31.177
I can't believe
I'm doing this.
Do you know what I love?

33:32.078 --> 33:34.546
I love women.

33:34.546 --> 33:36.982
Yeah?
Oh!

33:36.982 --> 33:41.553
I mean, I'm talking me,
an Asian chick, and
a schoolteacher in a shower.

33:41.553 --> 33:42.554
Oh, yeah.

33:42.554 --> 33:44.456
Get all soapy
together and so wet.

33:44.456 --> 33:48.127
And you know what? Maybe like
a construction lady comes in,

33:48.127 --> 33:50.329
like, you know,
like I can't even tell
if she's hot or not.

33:50.329 --> 33:51.763
Okay.
But then she says,

33:51.763 --> 33:53.832
"Looks like I could
do some work here."

33:53.832 --> 33:55.000
And she takes off her hat.

33:55.000 --> 33:56.702
It falls down. Sure.

33:56.702 --> 33:59.138
And then you guys come over and
all three of you undress her.

33:59.138 --> 34:00.872
Yeah. Hey, hey, guess what?
Yeah. What?

34:00.872 --> 34:03.242
I'm next door. Yeah, 'cause
I'm the superintendent,

34:03.242 --> 34:05.911
and I'm working on like
paperwork, like doing
people's checks, I'm like...

34:05.911 --> 34:08.414
Yeah. "What is that noise?"
Like, "That's weird.

34:08.414 --> 34:09.915
"There's not supposed
to be anybody next door."

34:09.915 --> 34:12.184
"Hey, who's in there?"
And I just hear, "Oh, oh."

34:12.184 --> 34:15.354
I listen by the door for
a while, then I open it up,
I'm like, "Hello?"

34:15.354 --> 34:16.622
I still can't see the steam.

34:16.622 --> 34:19.191
Ahhh! I'm so scared. Who is it?

34:19.191 --> 34:21.293
"Hey, you're not supposed
to be in here."

34:21.293 --> 34:22.928
Can I give you
something to say?

34:22.928 --> 34:24.463
Yeah.
Say this, say, say,

34:24.463 --> 34:26.898
"Hey, I knew something was
missing in this apartment,

34:26.898 --> 34:28.667
"a big cock."

34:28.667 --> 34:31.870
"I knew something was
missing in this apartment,
a big cock."

34:31.870 --> 34:34.140
And we're fucking,
and then someone else
goes, "Oh, yeah..."

34:34.140 --> 34:36.208
Fuck. I just thought
of something, man.

34:36.208 --> 34:38.009
What?
How are you gonna get there?

34:38.009 --> 34:40.212
I'm right next door, remember?
I'm just gonna walk over.

34:40.212 --> 34:42.047
No, man, this is miles
and miles away, man.

34:42.047 --> 34:43.415
You got to get there soon!

34:43.415 --> 34:44.350
I'm, like, managing
a bunch of properties?

34:44.350 --> 34:46.017
Yes!
Oh...

34:46.017 --> 34:48.019
How are you... It's across town.
How are you gonna get there?

34:48.019 --> 34:49.755
I don't know.
I don't have a car.
I gotta get a bus...

34:49.755 --> 34:51.823
No, man, you got to
fucking take this car.

34:51.823 --> 34:55.427
Yes. I am gonna buy this car.
It's a good car, right?

34:55.427 --> 34:57.463
No.
I don't give a shit.

34:57.463 --> 34:58.830
Go see the dudes in the back!

34:58.830 --> 35:00.899
Run, man! Run!
I'm gonna go buy this car.

35:00.899 --> 35:03.635
In your country, they would cut
your hands off

35:03.635 --> 35:05.671
because you're
stealing from us.

35:05.671 --> 35:08.674
You guys have got
an amazing deal,
I can't believe it.

35:08.674 --> 35:11.177
BOY: Mom! Mom!

35:11.177 --> 35:12.544
(LAUGHING) Yeah!

35:12.544 --> 35:13.812
(GRUNTS)

35:17.149 --> 35:18.484
(LAUGHING)

35:22.754 --> 35:24.523
(INDISTINCT CHATTERING)

35:28.059 --> 35:29.127
How we doing?

35:29.127 --> 35:30.696
Kicking ass.

35:30.696 --> 35:33.299
I was worried earlier, but we're
gonna have a great day.

35:33.299 --> 35:35.167
Check out that Blake kid.
He's on fire.

35:35.167 --> 35:36.268
Yeah, I noticed.

35:36.268 --> 35:37.803
Wasn't that your move?

35:37.803 --> 35:41.840
Well, mine ended with the
two-gun salute to heaven,

35:41.840 --> 35:43.575
but it's damn close.

35:43.575 --> 35:46.878
You remember when I told you
I partied with that beauty queen

35:46.878 --> 35:48.580
23 years ago in Temecula?

35:48.580 --> 35:51.183
I didn't put a hat
on my jimmy.

35:51.183 --> 35:56.188
Jesus, Don. You don't think
Blake's your son, do you?

36:01.727 --> 36:03.495
I'll tell you what,
why don't you guys go to finance

36:03.495 --> 36:04.763
and I'll meet you there,
all right?

36:04.763 --> 36:06.565
Okay.

36:06.565 --> 36:09.368
That's impressive, Blake.
You're a natural.

36:09.368 --> 36:11.036
Spend a lot of time growing up
around dealerships?

36:11.036 --> 36:14.105
No, but my mom always said
that I had it in my blood.

36:14.105 --> 36:15.674
I remember this
one time as a kid,

36:15.674 --> 36:17.876
I traded my crappy Huffy bike
to this kid down the block

36:17.876 --> 36:19.945
for his brand-new
shiny Schwinn.

36:19.945 --> 36:22.047
No shit.
No shit, Don.

36:22.047 --> 36:25.784
Hey, was your old man
around a lot when
you were growing up?

36:25.784 --> 36:29.521
No. He took off
before I was born.

36:29.521 --> 36:30.622
I'm gonna go back
to the sale, Don.

36:30.622 --> 36:32.724
Blake, how old are you?

36:32.724 --> 36:33.925
Twenty-two.

36:36.262 --> 36:37.863
Hey, kid. Don.

36:39.265 --> 36:40.399
Remember that guy that
wanted the Explorer?

36:40.399 --> 36:41.700
Here's what I got him to do.

36:41.700 --> 36:44.703
Buy his own house
from himself for $1,

36:44.703 --> 36:46.838
which means nothing,
but to the bank...

36:57.949 --> 36:59.451
BRENT: Don.

36:59.451 --> 37:01.119
Hey.
What's going on?

37:01.119 --> 37:03.589
Good job. Huh?

37:05.357 --> 37:07.259
What'd I do, Don?

37:09.428 --> 37:11.497
Fuck you, I don't need
your validation.

37:17.035 --> 37:20.306
Look at that number.
Seventy-one cars sold.

37:20.306 --> 37:23.675
I am looking at some real
salesmen out here. Good work.

37:23.675 --> 37:26.412
Yeah, we've actually sold 34%
of the inventory.

37:26.412 --> 37:28.414
DON: Wow! I'm proud of you.

37:28.414 --> 37:29.948
And, by the way,

37:29.948 --> 37:32.351
congrats, whoever pulled off
a Nigerian buyback,

37:32.351 --> 37:33.585
haven't seen that in years.

37:33.585 --> 37:35.687
That was me. You can suck it.

37:35.687 --> 37:37.689
What's a Nigerian buyback?

37:37.689 --> 37:41.660
Guy takes a customer's
trade-in, then 20 minutes later,

37:41.660 --> 37:45.797
sells it right back to said
customer at a mark-up.

37:45.797 --> 37:47.165
(ALL LAUGHING)

37:47.165 --> 37:48.934
And we're looking at
an even better day tomorrow.

37:48.934 --> 37:51.903
Bo Bice's brother coming
in here to sing some tunes.

37:51.903 --> 37:54.540
Shut up. Eric Bice?
The very same.

37:54.540 --> 37:56.542
So, I think we do
a little celebrating.

37:56.542 --> 38:00.512
And after a hot first day,
there's only one way to do it.
'Okie.

38:00.512 --> 38:02.213
What?
BLAKE: What's 'okie?

38:02.213 --> 38:03.582
Tell them about it, Dick.

38:03.582 --> 38:05.417
He's talking about karaoke,

38:05.417 --> 38:06.885
you fucking queers.

38:06.885 --> 38:09.287
God damn, Dick knows what
I'm talking about.

38:09.287 --> 38:11.623
Let's go. Let's get into it.

38:11.623 --> 38:12.958
Nice job, everybody.

38:14.793 --> 38:16.695
I've been watching
you out there, girl.

38:16.695 --> 38:19.531
Your moves are probably
responsible for 10 sales.

38:19.531 --> 38:24.269
Well, any individual
who pursues his or
her own self interest

38:24.269 --> 38:27.038
actually promotes
the interest of
society as a whole.

38:27.038 --> 38:32.478
It's all trade, baby.
That's what makes
the world go 'round.

38:32.478 --> 38:36.782
That's funny. I always
thought love made
the world go 'round.

38:37.916 --> 38:39.084
See you.

38:45.023 --> 38:46.592
Love.

38:46.592 --> 38:48.594
Boy, you should be proud.

38:48.594 --> 38:52.531
You took a rag-tag bunch
of losers and turned them
into first-rate salesmen.

38:52.531 --> 38:54.500
That's what I do, Ben.

38:54.500 --> 38:56.535
(I SWEAR PLAYING
ON CAR STEREO)

38:56.535 --> 38:57.903
(MUSIC STOPS)

39:01.440 --> 39:03.509
Hello, Ben.

39:03.509 --> 39:05.043
Hello, Stu.

39:05.043 --> 39:07.979
Looks like you guys
had a heck of a day.

39:07.979 --> 39:10.482
Hey, Paxton, Lance Bass
called. He said he...

39:10.482 --> 39:11.883
Fucking forget it.

39:11.883 --> 39:14.019
Yeah, like he would
have your number.

39:14.019 --> 39:16.722
Hey, Lance Bass never
opened for O-Town.

39:16.722 --> 39:18.590
My boy did.
You can google it.

39:18.590 --> 39:21.359
Yeah, I told them
that already, Dad.
They refused to google it.

39:21.359 --> 39:22.961
Huh.

39:22.961 --> 39:25.363
Well, let me cut to the chase
for you here, Ben.

39:25.363 --> 39:28.667
My boy Paxton's band,
Big Ups, they're really
starting to click,

39:28.667 --> 39:31.470
and we're running out
of rehearsal space over
at Harding Imports.

39:31.470 --> 39:32.971
So Paxton had a good idea.

39:32.971 --> 39:35.741
He said why not make
an offer on your lot,

39:35.741 --> 39:37.876
nice price, before
the bank gets it?

39:37.876 --> 39:39.911
That way, Paxton's out
front selling Beemers,

39:39.911 --> 39:42.113
then he runs around the back,
makes gold records.

39:42.113 --> 39:44.315
What do you think?
Oh, I don't know, Stu.

39:44.315 --> 39:45.517
We had a pretty
good day here.

39:45.517 --> 39:46.985
We had an outstanding day.

39:46.985 --> 39:48.520
Don't be all humble, Ben.
Come on.

39:48.520 --> 39:50.355
All right, hold it, Don.

39:50.355 --> 39:51.890
Give us a couple minutes
alone, will you?

39:51.890 --> 39:53.391
You got it, Ben.

39:53.391 --> 39:54.826
You too, Paxton.

39:56.027 --> 39:57.729
Hey, you know,
even if Ben doesn't sell,

39:57.729 --> 39:59.631
we're gonna get this place
for pennies on the dollar

39:59.631 --> 40:01.299
when he goes B-rupt.
Really?

40:01.299 --> 40:04.035
You're gonna screw over
your future father-in-law?

40:04.035 --> 40:05.804
It's called business,
Don. Okay?

40:05.804 --> 40:10.476
And besides, I would do anything
to take Big Ups worldwide.

40:10.476 --> 40:14.079
So, Ivy isn't enough for you?

40:14.079 --> 40:16.281
(LAUGHING)

40:16.281 --> 40:20.952
You have a crush on my fiancee.
That is rich!

40:20.952 --> 40:23.622
Here's the deal, old-timer.
Get over it.

40:23.622 --> 40:26.157
Here is why I'm not
threatened by that at all.

40:26.157 --> 40:27.793
A, I have a beautiful car.

40:27.793 --> 40:28.860
Yeah.

40:28.860 --> 40:31.597
B, I have a $44 haircut.

40:31.597 --> 40:32.864
Right.
Yeah, and C,

40:32.864 --> 40:35.901
I have slick threads. Yeah.

40:35.901 --> 40:37.769
Men's Wearhouse.
I like the way I look.

40:37.769 --> 40:41.339
Right.
I'm Temecula's newest hard-on.

40:41.339 --> 40:43.308
A, it looks like you just
snapped into a Slim Jim.

40:43.308 --> 40:44.743
B, your suit looks
like it was...

40:44.743 --> 40:46.144
I'm glad we could work
all this out, Ben.

40:46.144 --> 40:48.113
Work what out?

40:48.113 --> 40:51.817
Well, Don, it's time
I start thinking about
my future grandkids.

40:51.817 --> 40:53.418
(GROANS)
I sold the lot to Stu.

40:53.418 --> 40:56.588
He made me a real good offer.
Thank you for your support,

40:56.588 --> 40:59.525
and you'll be paid
for the whole four days.

40:59.525 --> 41:02.027
But we're pulling the plug.

41:02.027 --> 41:03.629
Can we get all of their stuff
out of here, pronto?

41:03.629 --> 41:05.030
We want to rehearse
here tonight.

41:05.030 --> 41:06.932
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hold on. Hold on a second.

41:06.932 --> 41:09.535
What about family?
What about history?

41:09.535 --> 41:11.369
(LAUGHING)

41:11.369 --> 41:12.904
What if we save this lot?

41:12.904 --> 41:14.272
What if I could guarantee you

41:14.272 --> 41:16.374
that I could sell
every car off this lot?

41:16.374 --> 41:18.877
Ben, that's foolish.
You don't even know this guy.

41:18.877 --> 41:22.147
Look at him.
He's a gun for hire, a tramp.

41:22.147 --> 41:25.416
Don, we're talking
about over 140 cars.

41:25.416 --> 41:27.886
Sure, it'd help the lot,
but that's impossible.

41:27.886 --> 41:30.388
All right.
Look, either I sell
every car on this lot,

41:30.388 --> 41:33.625
or I leave Temecula and get out
of the game for good.

41:33.625 --> 41:34.893
Doesn't move me at all.

41:34.893 --> 41:36.895
And you get Brent Gage
for the night.

41:36.895 --> 41:40.431
Sorry, Stu, but the deal's
off, at least till I see
how this thing pans out.

41:40.431 --> 41:42.100
Okay.

41:42.100 --> 41:44.069
You know, since you're
almost family, Ben,

41:44.069 --> 41:45.737
here's what I'm gonna do.

41:45.737 --> 41:47.706
I'm gonna save you a job
on my lot,

41:47.706 --> 41:51.009
after the bank
forecloses on yours.

41:51.009 --> 41:53.645
Damn it. Why are they
standing in the way of
my dreams, Daddy?

41:53.645 --> 41:54.780
Look it, here's the deal.

41:54.780 --> 41:56.181
Call your TV guy.

41:56.181 --> 41:58.149
Tell him we got to cut
some new spots right away.

41:58.149 --> 42:01.019
I have a script
for you, never fails.

42:02.287 --> 42:05.123
BOTH: * More than words

42:05.123 --> 42:12.097
* Is all you have to
do to make it real *

42:12.097 --> 42:14.099
Wait, now, so,

42:14.099 --> 42:17.502
he offered to pay us off
and we could leave town flush.

42:17.502 --> 42:18.937
And you said no.

42:18.937 --> 42:20.772
Yep.

42:20.772 --> 42:23.441
Motherfucker.
Hey, chill, chill!

42:23.441 --> 42:25.143
Come on, man, calm down.
It's Don.

42:25.143 --> 42:26.912
He wouldn't do it if he didn't
have a good reason.

42:26.912 --> 42:29.280
And then I told Ben that if we
don't sell all the cars

42:29.280 --> 42:31.449
that he could have
Brent for the night.

42:31.449 --> 42:33.051
Motherfucker...
BABS: All right. All right.

42:33.051 --> 42:36.087
Jibby, handle him.
Calm down. Calm down now.

42:36.087 --> 42:37.989
All right, here's
the scenario, all right?

42:37.989 --> 42:40.659
Tomorrow, I'm gonna sell
an assload of cars.

42:40.659 --> 42:44.830
And I suggest
you gentlemen do likewise.

42:47.933 --> 42:49.668
What the hell we gonna do?

42:49.668 --> 42:51.436
Why don't we chill
a little bit, Jibs?

42:51.436 --> 42:54.039
Just chill. Okay, it's cool.

42:54.039 --> 42:56.274
Don said we got TV spots
tomorrow, right?

42:56.274 --> 42:59.911
Bice is hitting town.
We're gonna pull this off.

43:03.682 --> 43:05.984
I'm gonna hit you
with a little Seger.

let's focus.

43:09.655 --> 43:11.489
This one goes out to Blake.

43:11.489 --> 43:14.760
It's about a boy,
the son of a man,
a mother's child.

43:14.760 --> 43:18.029
Let's get him a tissue,
'cause it's about to get raw.

43:18.029 --> 43:19.798
What the fuck is wrong
with that guy?

43:19.798 --> 43:23.735
* On a long and
lonesome highway

43:23.735 --> 43:25.170
* East of Omaha *

43:25.170 --> 43:26.705
Okay, I got to ask you
a question.

43:26.705 --> 43:28.073
Does Don
know what he's doing?

43:28.073 --> 43:30.208
I've seen that man
say a lot of crap

43:30.208 --> 43:33.078
just to sell cars
and move out of town.

43:33.078 --> 43:36.481
But this time,
he really means it.

43:36.481 --> 43:38.249
Truth be told,

43:39.818 --> 43:41.452
he ain't been the same
since 'Querque.

43:41.452 --> 43:42.688
'Querque?

43:42.688 --> 43:43.889

Oh!

Who calls it Captain Kirk?

43:52.330 --> 43:53.699
I don't know.

43:54.866 --> 43:56.467
We lost a good
man down there.

43:56.467 --> 43:58.569
Oh, he quit?
Died.

43:58.569 --> 44:01.039
From a car sale?
Hell, yes.

The rest of us come to terms.
Don's still fighting it.

44:06.644 --> 44:07.879
Wow.

44:07.879 --> 44:09.247
Only Jeff Robins wasn't
looking,

44:09.247 --> 44:10.581

him in the head.

tell your dad.

is really fun?

44:24.029 --> 44:25.697
Going to a motel
and wrestling.

44:25.697 --> 44:27.198
I love wrestling.

keeping secrets?

Absolutely.

'Cause I've got
a present for you.

44:42.948 --> 44:44.615
Secret present outside,
by the dumpster.

44:44.615 --> 44:45.683
Is it a baseball mitt?

44:45.683 --> 44:48.653
Fits you like a baseball mitt,

44:48.653 --> 44:50.388
like a glove, I hope.

44:50.388 --> 44:51.522
Is it new or is it old?

44:51.522 --> 44:53.191
It will be new for you.

44:53.191 --> 44:55.326
All right, that means
I'm gonna have to break it in.

44:55.326 --> 44:57.028
Yep.
I'm gonna have to break it in.

44:57.028 --> 44:59.798
I'll put a ball in there,
and I'll tie it off.

44:59.798 --> 45:01.132
Right.

45:01.132 --> 45:02.868
And then I'll put lotions
and oil on it,

No, I got to go home,
put my pajamas on,
and I got to shave.

I know, but, Peter, before
we do this, we'll just...

45:25.824 --> 45:27.558
We can wrestle later.

I got cancer of the nads.

to see one last big

So, my family and I are
asking you to come on
down to Selleck Motors

50:49.214 --> 50:50.615
Fuck you!

50:51.916 --> 50:54.152
Aren't you people tired
of being screwed over?

50:54.152 --> 50:55.420
(ALL AGREEING)

50:55.420 --> 50:58.123
Then let's fucking riot!

50:58.123 --> 51:00.658
Hold up a minute!

51:00.658 --> 51:01.992
WOMAN: Get him!

51:01.992 --> 51:03.027
DJ: Stop it!

51:03.027 --> 51:05.396
Hey... Hello! Hey, guys!

51:05.396 --> 51:07.798
Mr. Selleck, we got to get
you out of here. Come on.

51:07.798 --> 51:11.136
We got to hide, Brent.
We'll be safe in my room.

51:11.136 --> 51:13.971
Hold up a minute!

51:13.971 --> 51:16.407
Hold on! I got a big show!

51:18.676 --> 51:21.412
DJ: This does not look good
for you, Uncle Sam.

51:22.647 --> 51:23.848
Oh!

51:25.183 --> 51:27.084
And concussion.

51:32.089 --> 51:35.693
Don't mess with him!
That kid's got
retard strength!

51:35.693 --> 51:36.727
PETER: Dork!

51:36.727 --> 51:38.095
See.

51:38.095 --> 51:39.497
(SCREAMING)

51:43.768 --> 51:46.304
Who the fuck
brought alligators?

51:48.038 --> 51:52.009
I never thought I'd say
this, but thank God
the police are here.

51:52.009 --> 51:54.845
Welcome, police.

51:54.845 --> 51:57.982
Come on, let's lock up
some white people.

51:57.982 --> 52:00.851
Y'all are all retarded.

52:00.851 --> 52:02.187
Hello?

52:04.855 --> 52:07.292
IVY: This day
is completely shot.

52:08.393 --> 52:09.860
Can you believe
these animals?

52:09.860 --> 52:13.097
What the hell's happening
to this country?

52:13.097 --> 52:16.567
What are you talking about,
Dick? You started it.

52:16.567 --> 52:19.804
You remember? Cops gave you
a ticket for inciting a riot.

52:19.804 --> 52:21.172
You old goat.

52:21.172 --> 52:25.743
This is horrible.
Let's face it. It's over.

52:25.743 --> 52:27.912
Ow!
It's not over. Over?

52:27.912 --> 52:31.482
When is the last time that
there were that many cameras

52:31.482 --> 52:32.883
on this lot, huh?

52:32.883 --> 52:36.821
We got five hours left
in this day, okay?

52:36.821 --> 52:39.156
Now, I intend to sell
some cars, all right?

52:39.156 --> 52:41.526
Now, get in here.
Let's go over some
talking points. Come on.

RICKY: You know, look, guys,
the big problem here?

53:11.155 --> 53:12.457
We need a bigger
rehearsal space.

53:12.457 --> 53:14.292
Not a problem. Here's why.

53:14.292 --> 53:15.526
Huge riot down at
Selleck Motors.

53:15.526 --> 53:17.094
The place
is going down in flames.

53:17.094 --> 53:18.496
We're taking it over.

53:18.496 --> 53:20.365
It is the new Big Ups
rehearsal space.

53:20.365 --> 53:22.199
Are you serious?
Yeah.

53:22.199 --> 53:24.201
PAXTON: We're gonna...
We're gonna take it over.

53:24.201 --> 53:26.904
Pardon me, boys.

53:26.904 --> 53:29.574
Some bad news from
Selleck Motors.
Look at this.

53:29.574 --> 53:31.509
BEN ON TV: Listen, people get
excited over used cars,

53:31.509 --> 53:34.345
and, occasionally,
they'll punch and burn things.

53:34.345 --> 53:35.946
Now, some call that a riot.

53:35.946 --> 53:39.617
Me? I call it excitement
over the low, low prices

53:39.617 --> 53:41.719
down here at
Ben Selleck Motors.

53:41.719 --> 53:44.622
The police are
the real heroes.

53:44.622 --> 53:46.291
And because of that,
we're offering

53:46.291 --> 53:48.959
20% off and 0% financing

53:48.959 --> 53:52.730
to any police officer
that comes down,
anyone with a police hat,

53:52.730 --> 53:54.665
anyone that says
the word "police."

53:54.665 --> 53:59.937
This Don Ready
is like the rash
between my balls and thigh.

53:59.937 --> 54:05.175
And if you find an alligator
in your car, $500 off!

54:05.175 --> 54:07.912
Congratulations, Officer.

54:07.912 --> 54:10.881
You see that, Ben?
Just like that,
we're back in business.

54:20.425 --> 54:22.493
Motherfucker,
I ring the bell.

54:22.493 --> 54:23.994
HEATHER: The reason that
the Japanese outsell us

54:23.994 --> 54:26.531
is because they make
more fuel-efficient vehicles

54:26.531 --> 54:30.401
while Detroit insists on
pushing gas-guzzling SUVs.

54:30.401 --> 54:34.204
God damn, girl,
you turning me on.

54:34.204 --> 54:37.875
Would it be improper of me
to ask you out
for a drink tonight?

54:37.875 --> 54:41.879
I don't know, Jibby.
I've been hurt before.

54:41.879 --> 54:46.183
Well, my problem is
I ain't never allowed
myself to be hurt.

54:46.183 --> 54:48.353
I'm trying to be
more vulnerable.

54:48.353 --> 54:50.521
Well, you're an
honest man, Jibby,

54:50.521 --> 54:55.059
and honesty is the first step
to being vulnerable.

54:55.059 --> 54:57.362
You can pick me up at 9:00.

55:06.437 --> 55:08.706
JIBBY: Hey, Don.
Hey, Jibs.

55:08.706 --> 55:10.375
What's with
the shit-eating grin?

55:10.375 --> 55:12.843
For the first
time in my life,

55:12.843 --> 55:16.681
I have a chance
to make love to a woman.

55:19.384 --> 55:20.751
Love.

55:23.153 --> 55:24.522
(LAUGHING)

55:26.156 --> 55:28.693
I'm glad we found
the right car for you.

55:33.631 --> 55:36.133
Hey, Blake, you ready?

55:36.133 --> 55:37.368
For what?

55:37.368 --> 55:39.136
A little catch.

55:39.136 --> 55:41.806
You know, I'm starting to think
that maybe Ivy was right,

55:41.806 --> 55:43.508
maybe it's time
for old Don Ready

55:43.508 --> 55:48.045
to settle down
and plant some roots
in this crazy old world.

55:48.045 --> 55:49.447
Great.

55:49.447 --> 55:51.449
I mean, I've been on the move
for so long

55:51.449 --> 55:53.384
that I've
never taken time to stop

55:53.384 --> 55:56.654
and to hug the people that
are important in my life.

55:56.654 --> 56:01.492
And, Blake, don't ever think
that you're not important.
All right?

56:01.492 --> 56:03.861
Great.

56:03.861 --> 56:05.896
You ever think
about your daddy?

56:05.896 --> 56:07.865
(LAUGHING) No.

56:07.865 --> 56:10.067
I mean, who wants to think about
some piece of shit

56:10.067 --> 56:12.703
that gets a woman pregnant
and then takes off?

56:12.703 --> 56:16.741
You know, I'm not bitter.
I did fine without him.

56:18.075 --> 56:20.244
He's probably out
there with no family,

56:20.244 --> 56:21.679
nothing real to hold onto.

56:21.679 --> 56:24.148
Can you imagine how meaningless
life must be

56:24.148 --> 56:25.450
for a prick like that?

56:25.450 --> 56:26.851
What a douche.

56:36.427 --> 56:37.762
Hey.
Hey.

56:37.762 --> 56:41.265
I cannot believe this riot
actually helped.

56:41.265 --> 56:43.634
You are insane.

56:43.634 --> 56:45.570
You know, I'm gonna be
sorry to see you go.

56:45.570 --> 56:48.873
Well, Ivy, goodbyes are
an occupational hazard.

56:51.075 --> 56:52.577
Okay, wow.

56:52.577 --> 56:54.812
I don't know what's
going on with you.

56:54.812 --> 56:56.447
You are hot, you are cold.

56:56.447 --> 56:59.216
One minute you're happy,
then you're snapping at me.

56:59.216 --> 57:01.318
I mean...

57:01.318 --> 57:03.153
What happened in Albuquerque?

57:03.153 --> 57:05.289
You don't want to know what
happened in 'Querque.

57:05.289 --> 57:07.291
Actually, I do.

57:07.291 --> 57:11.128
Come on, what?
You can trust me.
Just let your guard down.

57:14.832 --> 57:17.401
McDermott was my best friend

57:17.401 --> 57:21.038
and the greatest car-sale DJ
anyone's ever seen.

57:21.038 --> 57:24.208
Damn it, it shouldn't have
gone down like that!

57:24.208 --> 57:27.444
(SIGHS) I was all wrapped
up with this woman.
It wasn't gonna work.

57:27.444 --> 57:30.280
I knew that.
Blah, blah, blah.
I was trying to impress her.

57:30.280 --> 57:32.483
We had already sold a bunch
of cars that weekend,

57:32.483 --> 57:34.218
but I wanted to
take it over the top.

57:34.218 --> 57:37.822
So, I thought, hey, let's put a
few bucks into it, you know?

57:37.822 --> 57:43.594
Get a good crowd in there.
We'd airdrop McDermott in,
dressed as Abe Lincoln.

57:43.594 --> 57:45.329
He would float in and say...

57:45.329 --> 57:47.632
I freed the slaves,
now I'm gonna free

57:47.632 --> 57:50.400
those cars from the slavery
of high prices!

57:50.400 --> 57:52.670
DON: We had a bunch of great
lines for him to say.

57:52.670 --> 57:54.304
Hey, just like
John Wilkes Booth,

57:54.304 --> 57:56.306
our prices are gonna sneak up
behind you

57:56.306 --> 57:57.908
and blow your brains out!

57:57.908 --> 58:00.778
When I asked him, he didn't even
blink. He just did it.

58:00.778 --> 58:04.114
Thanks, buddy. This is the
thrill of a lifetime!

58:04.114 --> 58:06.751
Drop zone! Drop zone!

58:06.751 --> 58:09.854
Me, I was on the ground
with Mrs. Talero.

58:09.854 --> 58:12.489
We planned to meet
in the back of a Taurus.

58:12.489 --> 58:15.693
That is so good. My husband
never does that to me anymore.
Oh, yes.

58:15.693 --> 58:18.328
She had me pack a bag
of sexual accoutrements.

58:18.328 --> 58:22.299
Basic shit, you know,
rubbers, lube, dildos.

58:22.299 --> 58:25.570
Weirder stuff.
Executioners' masks,
French ticklers.

58:25.570 --> 58:26.937
Yeah! Take me away!

58:26.937 --> 58:29.940
The only problem was
I took the wrong bag.

58:32.242 --> 58:33.477
Whoo!

58:33.477 --> 58:37.281
Fuck! Don gave me
the wrong bag!

58:37.281 --> 58:38.916
I can only imagine
what was going through

58:38.916 --> 58:42.553
McDermott's head as
he fell to his death.

58:42.553 --> 58:44.689
Got to try to get away
from this dildo!

58:44.689 --> 58:46.090
DON: The regrets
he must've had.

58:46.090 --> 58:48.358
Most people who are
in this situation,

58:48.358 --> 58:52.663
their life flashes before
their eyes and they go
through a list of regrets!

58:52.663 --> 58:58.102
For the next 45 seconds,
I want to go through the list
of things I've done right!

58:58.102 --> 59:03.574
Number one,
full-length back tattoo
of the Hawaiian Punch guy!

59:03.574 --> 59:06.176
10% real fruit juice,
motherfuckers!

59:06.176 --> 59:09.279
He had a huge heart,
but, my God, was he stupid.

59:09.279 --> 59:14.652
Number three,
had my wisdom teeth
put back into my skull!

59:17.588 --> 59:20.024
Christ, the dildo's back!

59:21.992 --> 59:26.563
I'm gonna get into an
aerodynamic tuck and use
the dildo to cushion my fall!

59:28.666 --> 59:31.268
I killed my best friend.

59:31.268 --> 59:35.439
I wish I could say
I didn't think it
would end this way!

59:35.439 --> 59:38.643
But I got to tell you,
I always knew it would!

59:38.643 --> 59:43.547
Falling to my death,
dressed as Abe Lincoln,
holding a big, purple dildo!

59:43.547 --> 59:45.950
This is how I drew it up.

59:47.852 --> 59:49.553
Huh?
Next thing I know,

59:49.553 --> 59:51.455
it's raining dildos.

59:51.455 --> 59:52.790
(CRASH)

59:54.792 --> 59:59.129
Had I just been focused on
the sale, it wouldn't have
gone down like that.

59:59.129 --> 1:00:02.266
Now it's all happening again,
with you and Blake.

1:00:02.266 --> 1:00:04.635
I'm losing who I am
and my focus.

1:00:04.635 --> 1:00:07.504
You think that riot
was an accident?
No, no, no.

1:00:07.504 --> 1:00:12.609
It happened
because I lost my focus.
That was damn good Seger.

1:00:12.609 --> 1:00:15.545
And now I'm falling for you.
Yeah, no, not again.
I'm not gonna do that.

1:00:15.545 --> 1:00:17.514
Wait, Don, come on, don't go.

1:00:17.514 --> 1:00:20.885
I'm gonna go sell some cars,
Mrs. Harding.

Hey, guys.
Brent.

1:00:30.795 --> 1:00:32.897
I have to say something.

1:00:32.897 --> 1:00:35.332
I think Don might
think I'm his son.

1:00:35.332 --> 1:00:37.534
Now, I've met my dad.
He lives in Louisiana.

1:00:37.534 --> 1:00:40.037
I just wasn't raised by him.

1:00:40.037 --> 1:00:43.073
Don's going through a lot
of big changes in his life,

1:00:43.073 --> 1:00:46.877
and right now you might be
the rock he's holding onto.

1:00:48.412 --> 1:00:50.314
Are you saying I should
pretend to be his son?

1:00:50.314 --> 1:00:51.782
Because, Brent,
that's fucked up.

1:00:51.782 --> 1:00:54.318
Is it? Or is it fucked down?

1:00:54.318 --> 1:00:56.453
Look, Don Ready would make
a damn good father to you,

1:00:56.453 --> 1:01:01.225
and right now,
I don't see a lot of guys
lining up for the job.

1:01:01.225 --> 1:01:05.129
Think about that.
And while you're at it,

1:01:05.129 --> 1:01:08.098
you think about why
your dad left you.

1:01:09.399 --> 1:01:13.370
Come in here and blame Don.
That's pathetic.

1:01:56.814 --> 1:02:00.017
You gonna turn
the lights off on me?
Like that's gonna scare me?

1:02:00.017 --> 1:02:01.986
I don't give a fuck!

1:02:01.986 --> 1:02:04.088
I'm homeless, motherfuckers!

1:02:09.593 --> 1:02:14.664
* It ain't no use to sit
and wonder why, babe

1:02:14.664 --> 1:02:17.768
* It don't matter, anyhow

1:02:17.768 --> 1:02:21.872
* It ain't no use to sit
and wonder why, babe *

1:02:22.739 --> 1:02:25.109
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

1:02:31.281 --> 1:02:33.150
Wow! Hey...

1:02:34.618 --> 1:02:36.053
Come on in.

1:02:36.053 --> 1:02:38.288
Shouldn't you be at home
with Bell Biv DeVoe

1:02:38.288 --> 1:02:40.024
writing personalized
vows or some shit?

1:02:40.024 --> 1:02:43.127
Don, I'm here.
Don't make me change my mind.

1:02:46.630 --> 1:02:49.766
PAXTON ON TV: Yo,
we're Temecula's
number-one pop sensation.

1:02:49.766 --> 1:02:51.101
* Big Ups! *
* Big Ups! *

1:02:51.101 --> 1:02:52.602
And we're gonna
be kicking it live,

1:02:52.602 --> 1:02:54.571
right here at Harding Imports
tomorrow,

1:02:54.571 --> 1:02:56.340
so come on down!
Congrats again on that. Yeah.

1:02:56.340 --> 1:02:58.042
Thanks.

1:02:58.042 --> 1:03:00.510
You want to turn it off?
He needs to see this.

1:03:00.510 --> 1:03:04.949
ALL: * With lease-to-own options
and a full-service garage *

1:03:04.949 --> 1:03:07.084
(SONG ECHOING)

1:03:14.658 --> 1:03:17.461
We're gonna make love.

1:03:17.461 --> 1:03:19.396
Love.

1:03:19.396 --> 1:03:21.631
Love.

1:03:21.631 --> 1:03:22.967
Love.

1:03:25.002 --> 1:03:26.570
Head & Shoulders?

1:03:26.570 --> 1:03:27.704
How'd you know?

1:03:27.704 --> 1:03:29.573
My uncle uses it.

1:03:33.710 --> 1:03:36.680
We're actually making love.

1:03:36.680 --> 1:03:39.716
I'm making love.

1:03:39.716 --> 1:03:41.551
We're making love.

1:03:41.551 --> 1:03:44.955
You know what
nobody ever told me
about making love?

1:03:44.955 --> 1:03:46.156
What?

1:03:46.156 --> 1:03:48.425
How boring it is.

1:03:48.425 --> 1:03:49.894
Yeah.

1:03:51.661 --> 1:03:55.232
You can do anything you want.
My safe word is
"blueberry pancakes."

1:03:55.232 --> 1:03:56.733
Okay.

1:03:56.733 --> 1:03:58.936
(GIVE IT TO ME PLAYING)

1:03:59.870 --> 1:04:01.471
(BOTH MOANING)

1:04:05.475 --> 1:04:07.878
Let's have sex in every
corner of this room.

1:04:07.878 --> 1:04:09.313
Okay.

1:04:13.617 --> 1:04:15.185
I fucked up.
I should've got
a bigger room.

1:04:15.185 --> 1:04:16.553
That's okay.

1:04:16.553 --> 1:04:18.956
I have points and
I didn't use them.

1:04:38.042 --> 1:04:40.510
Continental breakfast in bed.

1:04:40.510 --> 1:04:41.645
Hacienda Courts style.

1:04:41.645 --> 1:04:42.913
Wow.

1:04:42.913 --> 1:04:44.448
You know why this is
the best breakfast?

1:04:44.448 --> 1:04:46.816
Why?
Bear claws, crullers,

1:04:46.816 --> 1:04:50.154
prison-size orange juice.
Mmm!

1:04:50.154 --> 1:04:54.524
You know, I actually
feel bad for Paxton.

1:04:54.524 --> 1:04:57.694
I didn't mean to come in
and split you guys up,

1:04:57.694 --> 1:05:00.264
but engagements are
made to be broken.

1:05:00.264 --> 1:05:01.265
Um...

1:05:01.265 --> 1:05:04.234
Don, I'm not leaving Paxton.

1:05:05.635 --> 1:05:07.171
What?

1:05:07.171 --> 1:05:09.606
You don't love him.

1:05:09.606 --> 1:05:12.142
Well, now, that's
not necessarily true.

1:05:12.142 --> 1:05:15.545
And, you know,
I'm almost 30 years old.

1:05:15.545 --> 1:05:18.715
I mean, what am I supposed
to do, you know?

1:05:18.715 --> 1:05:20.517
I want things,

1:05:20.517 --> 1:05:24.221
and I want a family,
and Paxton wants
those things, too.

1:05:25.489 --> 1:05:26.656
(SIGHS)

1:05:28.692 --> 1:05:31.962
I mean, look, nobody
dreams of buying
an '88 Lynx station wagon,

1:05:31.962 --> 1:05:33.930
but we sold one
yesterday, right?

1:05:33.930 --> 1:05:35.299
And the people who
bought it, bought it

1:05:35.299 --> 1:05:37.267
because buying
a 2007 Land Rover

1:05:37.267 --> 1:05:38.735
wasn't an option for them.

1:05:38.735 --> 1:05:40.337
So, what are my options, Don?

1:05:40.337 --> 1:05:43.473
What about us? What about giving
us a chance? I mean...

1:05:43.473 --> 1:05:45.775
Where, in the Hacienda Courts
in Boise?

1:05:45.775 --> 1:05:47.511
Or how about the Hacienda
Courts in Wichita?

1:05:47.511 --> 1:05:49.279
'Cause if things
go really well,

1:05:49.279 --> 1:05:51.581
we could raise our kids in the
Hacienda Courts in Muskogee.

1:05:51.581 --> 1:05:54.318
What did you even
come here for?

1:05:55.819 --> 1:05:58.788
Because I wanted
one last fling.

1:05:58.788 --> 1:06:02.792
And I know you're not
gonna stick around.

1:06:02.792 --> 1:06:08.065
So, you're just gonna have sex
with me and then leave?

1:06:09.533 --> 1:06:11.268
This hurts!

1:06:11.268 --> 1:06:13.737
Guess this is what women
mean when they say,

1:06:13.737 --> 1:06:16.606
"So you're just gonna have sex
with me and leave? This hurts."

1:06:16.606 --> 1:06:18.008
(SCREAMS)

1:06:18.008 --> 1:06:19.509
I'm sorry.

1:06:19.509 --> 1:06:22.479
Something that I want is being
taken away from me,

1:06:22.479 --> 1:06:24.781
and I don't like it!
I don't like it!

1:06:24.781 --> 1:06:27.917
This is exactly how
I felt after 'Querque!

1:06:27.917 --> 1:06:29.553
Screw everybody!

1:06:29.553 --> 1:06:34.024
The only thing that I trust
in this world is cars!

1:06:49.139 --> 1:06:50.274
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

1:06:50.274 --> 1:06:52.409
BRENT: Come on, Don!

1:06:52.409 --> 1:06:53.877
Come on!

1:06:53.877 --> 1:06:55.445
What's going on?
Don!

1:06:55.445 --> 1:06:57.747
Don's never been late
for the last day of a sale.

1:06:59.449 --> 1:07:03.787
Don's gone, and you
did not see me here.

1:07:03.787 --> 1:07:05.422
Okay.

1:07:05.422 --> 1:07:06.890
Well, did he go
to the lot?

1:07:06.890 --> 1:07:10.494
I don't know. He kind of just
freaked out and left.

1:07:12.962 --> 1:07:15.099
'Querque all over again.

1:07:15.099 --> 1:07:16.800
Fucking 'Querque.

1:07:25.008 --> 1:07:26.710
He's gone.

1:07:26.710 --> 1:07:28.512
Looked everywhere,
called the cops.

1:07:28.512 --> 1:07:30.547
No one knows where he is.

1:07:31.915 --> 1:07:34.984
I'm sorry, fellas,
I apologize from all of us.

1:07:34.984 --> 1:07:37.154
No. Hold on.

1:07:37.154 --> 1:07:38.722
You guys did your best.

1:07:38.722 --> 1:07:41.758
I mean, it was an uphill battle
from the beginning, right?

1:07:41.758 --> 1:07:44.694
But, hey! We still
sold some cars, right?

1:07:44.694 --> 1:07:47.030
We still sold some cars!

1:07:47.030 --> 1:07:48.365
(LAUGHS)

1:07:48.365 --> 1:07:50.267
Might as well dust
off the old resume.

1:07:50.267 --> 1:07:52.936
(SOBBING)

1:07:52.936 --> 1:07:55.339
Hey, wait just a minute.

1:07:55.339 --> 1:07:58.108
I practically built
this dealership myself,

1:07:58.108 --> 1:08:01.145
and I remember a day when
we wouldn't hang our heads

1:08:01.145 --> 1:08:03.813
or talk about
closing the lot.

1:08:03.813 --> 1:08:07.751
A customer would walk in here
and this place would pop!

1:08:07.751 --> 1:08:09.486
There you go, Ben.

1:08:09.486 --> 1:08:12.088
And having Don "The Goods" Ready
here for three days

1:08:12.088 --> 1:08:16.293
made me remember why
I became a car salesman
in the first place.

1:08:16.293 --> 1:08:19.429
(ALL CHEERING)

1:08:19.429 --> 1:08:21.731
TEDDY: Mr. Selleck's right.

1:08:21.731 --> 1:08:25.502
We can do this. Don has taught
us all something.

1:08:25.502 --> 1:08:29.038
He knew more about us than
we knew about ourselves.

1:08:29.038 --> 1:08:30.340
Yeah.

1:08:30.340 --> 1:08:33.177
You know,
I never much cared for Jews,

1:08:33.177 --> 1:08:35.479
queers or fucking Eskimos,

1:08:35.479 --> 1:08:37.847
but that's just
the way I was brought up.

1:08:37.847 --> 1:08:39.916
Is that it?

1:08:39.916 --> 1:08:41.285
Yeah. That's it.

1:08:41.285 --> 1:08:43.187
I just wanted to
put that out there.

1:08:43.187 --> 1:08:46.290
I thought we were
opening up here!

1:08:46.290 --> 1:08:49.159
Guys. We can sell these cars.

1:08:49.159 --> 1:08:50.360
There you go!

1:08:50.360 --> 1:08:51.895
Ready has carried
us this far.

1:08:51.895 --> 1:08:55.299
Well, I say we start
carrying our own weight.

1:08:55.299 --> 1:08:58.368
So let's get out there
and sell the metal!
Who's with me?

1:08:58.368 --> 1:09:00.837
We are!
We are!

1:09:00.837 --> 1:09:02.772
I'm with you! Listen to him!
We are! We are!

1:09:02.772 --> 1:09:07.977
ALL: (CHANTING)
We are! We are! We are!

1:09:07.977 --> 1:09:10.714
We are! We are! We are!
We are! We are! We are!

1:09:12.482 --> 1:09:13.917
STU: You don't even
know this guy.

1:09:13.917 --> 1:09:17.287
Look at him.
He's a gun for hire, a tramp.

1:09:17.287 --> 1:09:21.825
BLAKE: He's probably out
there with no family,
nothing real to hold onto.

1:09:21.825 --> 1:09:24.828
IVY: And I know you're not
gonna stick around.

1:09:24.828 --> 1:09:27.831
JIBBY: James Van Der Beek,
my nigger.

1:09:31.301 --> 1:09:34.871
McDERMOTT: Well, if it isn't
Don goddamn fucking Ready.

1:09:34.871 --> 1:09:37.741
Holy fuck. McDermott?

1:09:38.675 --> 1:09:41.945
ANGELS: * He has returned

1:09:41.945 --> 1:09:44.881
* He is McDermott *

1:09:44.881 --> 1:09:46.115
Oh, my God!

1:09:46.115 --> 1:09:47.684
I been waiting a long time

1:09:47.684 --> 1:09:49.553
to set the record straight
with you, man.

1:09:49.553 --> 1:09:53.990
* He's setting the record
straight, motherfucker *

1:09:53.990 --> 1:09:58.127
I trusted you, Don. I trusted
that what we were doing
was bigger than all of us.

1:09:58.127 --> 1:10:02.031
But it turns out, all you
wanted to do was get your
ball sack played with

1:10:02.031 --> 1:10:03.500
by some woman
with bad credit.

1:10:03.500 --> 1:10:06.503
* It's an age-old tale

1:10:06.503 --> 1:10:10.039
* His trust was
betrayed by tang *

1:10:10.039 --> 1:10:11.508
Balls and wiener.

1:10:11.508 --> 1:10:13.843
They let angels out of heaven
to cuss at people?

1:10:13.843 --> 1:10:16.946
Yeah, of course. That's
what's going down, dipshit.

1:10:16.946 --> 1:10:20.450
* Fuck you, Don Ready,
fuck your family *

1:10:20.450 --> 1:10:24.254
I don't get it, McDermott.
Man, you used to be
so easygoing and...

1:10:24.254 --> 1:10:27.957
Yeah, I was.
I was easy breezy.
And then, guess what?

1:10:27.957 --> 1:10:32.095
I fell out of a plane
and hit the ground,
and I didn't bounce.

1:10:32.095 --> 1:10:35.399
But you know what did bounce?
My butthole through my face.

1:10:35.399 --> 1:10:39.303
* Geronimo, splat

1:10:39.303 --> 1:10:43.307
* Displaced anus *

1:10:44.341 --> 1:10:46.276
I'm so sorry, McDermott.

1:10:46.276 --> 1:10:49.346
I need your help, man.
I feel so empty.

1:10:49.346 --> 1:10:55.084
Don't you get it, Don?
This is where all the cars
we sell end up.

1:10:55.084 --> 1:10:58.121
It's not about the cars.
It's about the team

1:10:58.121 --> 1:11:00.524
and finding people
you love. That's it.

1:11:00.524 --> 1:11:02.091
What do I do?

1:11:02.091 --> 1:11:03.960
(SIGHS) You know what to do.

1:11:03.960 --> 1:11:08.398
Get off the road, man.
I mean, after 35,
it just looks pathetic.

1:11:08.398 --> 1:11:13.437
* While we're on the subject
You're too old
for a Facebook page *

1:11:13.437 --> 1:11:15.339
I'm sorry, McDermott.

1:11:15.339 --> 1:11:17.206
It's okay, man.

1:11:17.206 --> 1:11:21.044
I'll see you in 28 years.
That's when you're gonna die.

1:11:21.044 --> 1:11:24.481
* August 19, 2036 *

1:11:24.481 --> 1:11:25.849
How am I gonna die?

1:11:25.849 --> 1:11:29.085
Choking on a sausage patty
at a strip club.

1:11:29.085 --> 1:11:31.888
Is there any way
they could sing it?
'Cause it sounds sad.

1:11:31.888 --> 1:11:36.693
No, it's not very lyrical,
and it is sad. So, no.

1:11:36.693 --> 1:11:37.894
A little bit? A little...
No.

1:11:37.894 --> 1:11:39.095
We talked about it

1:11:39.095 --> 1:11:42.265
in the heaven spaceship
that brought us here.

1:11:42.265 --> 1:11:43.132
We got to jump.
Change your ways.

1:11:43.132 --> 1:11:44.568
No, no.

1:11:44.568 --> 1:11:46.403
See you, Don.

1:11:49.873 --> 1:11:52.609
Oh, my God, Ivy and the team,
they need me.

1:11:52.609 --> 1:11:55.144
They need me right now.
Need me.

1:11:55.144 --> 1:11:56.746
Thank you, McDermott!

1:12:08.057 --> 1:12:10.360
Get them out of the back lot
and into the front!

1:12:10.360 --> 1:12:12.729
(WHISTLES) Let's go, let's go!

1:12:14.564 --> 1:12:17.100
I think you guys are gonna
really like this car.
It's a good fit.

1:12:17.100 --> 1:12:19.536
Good news. My finance guy
says it's gonna work.

1:12:19.536 --> 1:12:20.670
Are you serious?

1:12:20.670 --> 1:12:22.439
(CHUCKLING) Zooha!

1:12:32.816 --> 1:12:35.819
It's all Don.
You understand?

1:12:35.819 --> 1:12:36.820
All of it.

1:12:36.820 --> 1:12:41.491
* You looked all right before

1:12:41.491 --> 1:12:44.093
* Fox on the run

1:12:44.093 --> 1:12:49.032

1:12:57.841 --> 1:12:58.942
Oh!

1:12:58.942 --> 1:13:00.644
Retard!

1:13:02.345 --> 1:13:03.713
I love you.

1:13:05.381 --> 1:13:08.251
I've got some things
I need to make right
on the ground!

1:13:08.251 --> 1:13:11.020
I'm doing this for
my friend McDermott!

1:13:11.020 --> 1:13:13.523
He died,
and I'm jumping for him!

1:13:13.523 --> 1:13:16.225
Makes all the sense
in the world!

1:13:16.225 --> 1:13:19.563
One, two, three! Jump!

a good deal there.

Pop the clutch!
Pop the clutch!

1:13:28.505 --> 1:13:32.809
We did it. We sold every
last car on the lot.

1:13:32.809 --> 1:13:35.945
Man, I wish Don
was here to see this.

1:13:38.114 --> 1:13:39.949

Hey, look, everyone!
It's Superman!

1:13:43.119 --> 1:13:45.555
I want to come down
right at Selleck Motors,
all right?

1:13:45.555 --> 1:13:47.123
Got it.
All right.

1:13:49.058 --> 1:13:50.894
Where are the cars?

1:13:50.894 --> 1:13:52.629
Wait a minute! Is that Don?

1:13:52.629 --> 1:13:54.664
Look out! Run! Run!

1:13:54.664 --> 1:13:57.767
Watch your head, team!
Coming in hot.

1:14:02.739 --> 1:14:04.808
Hey, Jibby,
where are all the cars?

1:14:04.808 --> 1:14:07.811
Don, we did it.
We sold every
single one of them.

1:14:07.811 --> 1:14:11.548
You're shitting me.
That's fantastic!

1:14:11.548 --> 1:14:13.182
They all stepped up.
DON: Unbelievable.

1:14:13.182 --> 1:14:15.051
I'm proud of you guys,
all of you!

1:14:15.051 --> 1:14:17.654
We couldn't have
done it without you,
Mr. Ready.

1:14:17.654 --> 1:14:19.689
You taught us all
to stand on our own.

1:14:19.689 --> 1:14:22.992
Your time here has been rich
and filled with wisdom.

1:14:22.992 --> 1:14:24.761
I don't know what to say.

1:14:24.761 --> 1:14:27.396
Why not start
with the truth, Don?

1:14:27.396 --> 1:14:31.434
Well, the truth is,
you sons of bitches
saved Selleck Motors!

1:14:31.434 --> 1:14:32.869
(ALL CHEERING)

1:14:34.270 --> 1:14:36.339
Fuck you, Don Ready!

1:14:36.339 --> 1:14:40.409
You didn't sell all the cars.
You lose. You're losers.

1:14:40.409 --> 1:14:44.447
What are you talking about?
All the cars are gone.
Lot stays with the Sellecks.

1:14:44.447 --> 1:14:47.717
Come on, Stu, a deal's a deal.
We sold all the cars
on the lot.

1:14:47.717 --> 1:14:52.455
Nobody sold the Bandit Car.
Rules are rules.
The lot's mine.

1:14:52.455 --> 1:14:53.623
The Bandit Car?

1:14:53.623 --> 1:14:56.325
Don said every
car on the lot.

1:14:56.325 --> 1:14:59.495
Bandit Car's a car
and it's on the lot.

1:14:59.495 --> 1:15:01.898
Hold on a second.
That thing is a prop.

1:15:01.898 --> 1:15:05.368
Don, that is not a prop.
That is a $200,000 automobile.

1:15:05.368 --> 1:15:06.670
This is good.

1:15:06.670 --> 1:15:08.437
Is this the great Don Ready

1:15:08.437 --> 1:15:11.240
complaining about how hard
it is to sell a car?

1:15:11.240 --> 1:15:13.309
Did you hear that, everybody?
Did you hear that?

1:15:13.309 --> 1:15:17.080
Maybe he's not so great.
Maybe he sucks!

1:15:18.582 --> 1:15:20.717
So, I guess you lose!

1:15:20.717 --> 1:15:24.854
Ben, you lose the lot.
Don, you have to skip town.

1:15:26.690 --> 1:15:28.792
Right, everybody?

1:15:36.666 --> 1:15:41.738
You know, Paxton, I been
doing a lot of thinking
these past few days.

1:15:43.673 --> 1:15:44.774
(CHUCKLING)

1:15:44.774 --> 1:15:47.243
About what, asshole?

1:15:47.243 --> 1:15:49.412
Dreams.

1:15:49.412 --> 1:15:51.447
About how we either,
you know...

1:15:51.447 --> 1:15:54.017
We either cherish them
or let them die on the vine.
Uh-huh.

1:15:54.017 --> 1:15:55.619
What'd you want to be
when you were a kid?

1:15:55.619 --> 1:15:58.254
Me, I wanted to be
a ref in the WNBA.

1:15:58.254 --> 1:16:00.156
You know, 'cause I like women
and I like basketball.

1:16:00.156 --> 1:16:01.625
Can you get off my back?

1:16:01.625 --> 1:16:03.860
You want to do
this one on your own?
Yeah, thanks, man.

1:16:03.860 --> 1:16:06.863
I get that. Okay,
you guys do your thing.
Uh-huh.

1:16:06.863 --> 1:16:08.965
What'd you dream
about, Paxton?

1:16:08.965 --> 1:16:10.934
Music. Music's been my passion

1:16:10.934 --> 1:16:12.368
ever since I fell in love
with the classics.

1:16:12.368 --> 1:16:14.503
Now, when you say classics,
what do you mean?

1:16:14.503 --> 1:16:19.809
Well, it's a pretty short
list. You got your 'N Sync.

1:16:19.809 --> 1:16:22.746
You got your 98 Degrees,
your Boyz II Men.

1:16:22.746 --> 1:16:24.380
And then pretty much
the Backstreet Boys

1:16:24.380 --> 1:16:26.650
came along and revolutionized
music as a whole.

1:16:26.650 --> 1:16:29.585
Hello!
What about O-Town?

1:16:29.585 --> 1:16:31.520
That was the best
night of my life.

1:16:31.520 --> 1:16:34.323
See, I haven't had the best
night of my life yet.

1:16:34.323 --> 1:16:36.025
Someday though, huh?

1:16:36.025 --> 1:16:38.895
All personal crap aside, I hear
Big Ups is pretty damn good.

1:16:38.895 --> 1:16:40.296
Come on, who said that?

1:16:40.296 --> 1:16:41.698
People talk.

1:16:41.698 --> 1:16:43.733
BABS: Is he doing
what I think he's doing?

1:16:43.733 --> 1:16:45.534
JIBBY: No way.

1:16:45.534 --> 1:16:50.106
If he moves that car,
I'll eat my own pussy.

1:16:50.106 --> 1:16:51.641

Thirty-two years
in the business

1:16:53.276 --> 1:16:56.345
and I've never seen this,
a dealer-to-dealer lot sale.

1:16:56.345 --> 1:16:57.681
This is suicide.

1:16:57.681 --> 1:17:00.016
Come on, Don,
stay focused.

1:17:00.016 --> 1:17:01.417
Let me ask you
something, man.

1:17:01.417 --> 1:17:02.585
You ever think about just
dropping everything

1:17:02.585 --> 1:17:04.053
and going for it?

1:17:04.053 --> 1:17:05.588
I'm not talking about
setting up some studio

1:17:05.588 --> 1:17:08.224
in the back of a car lot.
I'm talking about you,

1:17:08.224 --> 1:17:10.426
Ricky and Jason
living the life, man,

1:17:10.426 --> 1:17:14.497
and putting yourselves
on the line on a daily basis.

1:17:14.497 --> 1:17:15.832
Wait. What are you doing?

1:17:15.832 --> 1:17:18.301
Picture this, Paxton.

1:17:18.301 --> 1:17:22.505
Big Ups touring
the Florida Panhandle, right?

1:17:22.505 --> 1:17:24.908

1:17:25.809 --> 1:17:28.444

And now it's Panama Beach.

1:17:31.114 --> 1:17:32.648

1:17:32.648 --> 1:17:35.084
and all you can
hear is 7,500 girls

1:17:35.084 --> 1:17:38.121
screaming at the top
of their lungs, right?

1:17:38.121 --> 1:17:41.357
And the bass,
it starts pumping.

1:17:41.357 --> 1:17:44.060
Pump, pump, pump, pump.

1:17:44.060 --> 1:17:47.530
The girls start jumping.
Jump, jump, jump.

1:17:47.530 --> 1:17:52.068
Ricky and Jason, they hit
the stage. Dance,
dance, dance, dance, dance.

1:17:52.068 --> 1:17:53.636
What happens next, Paxton?

1:17:53.636 --> 1:17:55.705
I don't know. What?

1:17:55.705 --> 1:17:58.842
An engine roars to life.

1:17:58.842 --> 1:18:01.745
What?
I mean, just fucking roars!

it's one of only
five used in the movie.

1:18:24.667 --> 1:18:26.069
Yeah. 'Cause we're good.

you're good.

rock star in that car.

Holy shit.
He might have him.

a wonder of nature,

1:18:38.181 --> 1:18:40.116

Are you really sorry, Don?

I'm not sorry.

I've been doing
a lot of thinking
about friends and family,

1:20:23.953 --> 1:20:25.488
and I decided that
I can't care for them

1:20:25.488 --> 1:20:29.058

so I'm settling here.

the past, but I'll tell you

I can guarantee you I will
always be there for you
in the future, all right?
