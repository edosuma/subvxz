00:02.562 --> 00:04.275
Previously on "Castle"...

00:04.276 --> 00:06.447
That's Sara El-Masri.
She was abducted.

00:06.448 --> 00:08.628
I will pay anything.

00:08.629 --> 00:10.689
She's my only child.

00:10.690 --> 00:11.930
They took Alexis, too.

00:11.931 --> 00:13.968
She was just in the wrong
place at the wrong time.

00:13.969 --> 00:16.935
If there is a lead,
we are gonna find it.

00:16.936 --> 00:18.280
Go! Go!

00:18.281 --> 00:19.809
The farmhouse was empty.

00:19.810 --> 00:21.837
We searched top to bottom.
They're gone.

00:21.838 --> 00:23.947
Roger Henson-- he was
tortured at length

00:23.948 --> 00:25.649
by someone who knew
what they were doing.

00:25.650 --> 00:27.218
Henson was working
for the kidnappers.

00:27.219 --> 00:28.559
Why would they torture him?

00:28.560 --> 00:29.471
I got it.

00:29.472 --> 00:31.419
You're going to get out of here.

00:31.420 --> 00:31.996
Daddy!

00:31.997 --> 00:33.812
Alexis. Where are you?

00:33.813 --> 00:34.765
I don't know.

00:34.766 --> 00:35.947
They're coming.
They found out we're gone.

00:35.948 --> 00:37.512
Get out of there now.

00:38.827 --> 00:40.645
Can you tell where the
call is coming from?

00:41.142 --> 00:43.048
The call originated
from a cell tower

00:43.113 --> 00:44.349
in Paris, France.

00:50.823 --> 00:52.191
Help!

00:53.460 --> 00:54.945
No! No!

00:54.946 --> 00:56.012
Get off me!

00:56.013 --> 00:57.574
Aah!

01:00.148 --> 01:02.291
They're in another country.
How is that possible?

01:02.292 --> 01:03.374
We don't know, but clearly

01:03.375 --> 01:05.610
the kidnappers were working
for outside interests.

01:05.611 --> 01:08.308
The voices on the call have
been identified as Egyptian.

01:08.309 --> 01:10.472
This isn't a
kidnapping for ransom,

01:10.605 --> 01:12.016
is it?

01:12.293 --> 01:13.602
Why are they in Paris?

01:13.603 --> 01:14.511
I don't know.

01:14.512 --> 01:15.720
They took your daughter there,

01:15.721 --> 01:18.291
and my daughter along with her.
There must be a reason.

01:18.292 --> 01:19.573
I don't know!

01:19.574 --> 01:21.155
They are covering their tracks.
Why?

01:21.156 --> 01:22.573
Please.

01:23.311 --> 01:25.702
They have our daughter, too.

01:30.002 --> 01:31.163
Show them the sketch.

01:31.164 --> 01:32.410
A neighbor spotted this man

01:32.411 --> 01:34.592
coming out of the
farmhouse driveway

01:34.593 --> 01:36.474
after the girls were taken.

01:36.475 --> 01:38.432
Do either of you recognize him?

01:38.808 --> 01:40.637
No, he's not familiar.

01:43.763 --> 01:45.496
So what's our next step?

01:45.520 --> 01:48.231
The Skype call was made over
a cellular data network,

01:48.232 --> 01:49.738
so we have isolated the signal

01:49.739 --> 01:51.945
to a 30-square-kilometer area.

01:51.946 --> 01:53.814
30-square kilometers
is the whole city.

01:53.815 --> 01:54.442
I know.

01:54.443 --> 01:56.410
But hopefully, an
analysis of the video

01:56.411 --> 01:58.873
will give us a clue as to
where they're being held.

01:58.874 --> 02:01.135
In the meantime, we're reaching
out to the embassy to estab--

02:01.136 --> 02:03.052
Reaching out?
What does that mean?

02:03.334 --> 02:05.411
There are certain protocols
we have to follow

02:05.412 --> 02:08.612
before we can move forward,
permissions we have to get.

02:08.852 --> 02:10.496
And how long will that take?

02:10.497 --> 02:11.807
A day or two at the most.

02:11.808 --> 02:13.125
A day or...

02:13.919 --> 02:15.574
Our daughters are out
there right now.

02:15.575 --> 02:17.822
They need our help right now.

02:18.250 --> 02:19.846
If you want to help
your daughter,

02:19.847 --> 02:21.516
you're gonna have to be patient.

02:29.183 --> 02:30.170
Hey.

02:36.923 --> 02:38.776
She sounded so scared.

02:41.430 --> 02:42.350
I could hear it in her voice,

02:42.351 --> 02:44.404
just like when she
was a little girl.

02:45.886 --> 02:47.753
And there was
nothing I could do.

02:48.627 --> 02:50.197
She wasn't hurt, Castle.

02:50.198 --> 02:52.069
That's what matters.

02:53.101 --> 02:55.491
That's what we hold on to.

02:56.871 --> 02:58.658
I just want her home.

03:03.275 --> 03:05.199
We're not giving up yet.

03:05.813 --> 03:07.218
Hey.

03:07.652 --> 03:09.793
They just called
El-Masri with terms.

03:09.794 --> 03:12.009
It's too soon.
We can't be in position in time.

03:12.010 --> 03:13.689
I don't care.
I'm getting her back.

03:13.690 --> 03:15.617
- What did they say?
- It was a ransom demand.

03:15.618 --> 03:17.873
$15 million euro-- from
anti-Mubarak dissidents.

03:17.874 --> 03:19.964
They set an exchange
three hours from now.

03:19.965 --> 03:20.656
Where?

03:20.657 --> 03:22.237
In Paris down by The Seine.

03:22.238 --> 03:24.303
Mr. El-Masri, you have
to let me contact

03:24.304 --> 03:25.839
- the local authorities.
- No!

03:25.862 --> 03:26.727
They were clear.

03:26.728 --> 03:29.127
They see police,
my daughter dies.

03:29.128 --> 03:31.087
We'll pay to get her back.

03:31.088 --> 03:32.541
Did they...

03:32.838 --> 03:34.604
Did they say anything
about Alexis?

03:34.605 --> 03:36.675
Anwar insisted,

03:36.676 --> 03:39.855
and they've agreed to
release both our daughters.

03:44.738 --> 03:46.392
If there is anything I owe you...

03:46.393 --> 03:47.531
You owe me nothing.

03:49.377 --> 03:52.329
If the police aren't involved,
then who's making the drop?

03:52.330 --> 03:54.232
My wife has a sister
living in Paris.

03:54.233 --> 03:55.875
Her husband will
do the exchange.

03:55.876 --> 03:59.046
Now if you'll excuse us, we
have many calls to make.

03:59.761 --> 04:00.977
Thank you.

04:01.673 --> 04:03.577
Just pray these men
are honorable.

04:07.092 --> 04:08.743
There are security cameras

04:08.744 --> 04:10.415
covering that portion
of The Seine.

04:10.958 --> 04:12.790
At the very least, maybe
we can get a tap in,

04:12.791 --> 04:14.156
see who these guys are.

04:19.644 --> 04:21.069
Sir, we're live.

04:21.862 --> 04:22.899
Any activity?

04:22.900 --> 04:24.482
It looks deserted so far.

04:32.270 --> 04:33.368
There.

04:33.451 --> 04:34.957
Can you get any closer?

04:41.808 --> 04:43.803
That's him. That's Ahmed.

04:45.941 --> 04:48.043
This doesn't even seem real.

04:48.748 --> 04:50.486
It's like some kind of show.

04:52.000 --> 04:58.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:20.101 --> 05:20.725
Ahmed!

05:20.726 --> 05:22.328
Get the Paris police on the phone.
Now.

05:22.329 --> 05:24.417
No, no, no, no! Wait. Wait.

05:33.454 --> 05:35.169
No. No!

05:46.730 --> 05:48.510
Where--where are they?
Where are the girls?

05:59.264 --> 06:00.971
He has her. She's safe.

06:08.728 --> 06:10.406
Where's Alexis?

06:17.759 --> 06:19.969
Agent Harris just
spoke with Sara.

06:19.970 --> 06:23.959
She and Alexis were separated
after the escape attempt.

06:23.960 --> 06:26.169
And that was the last
time that she saw her.

06:27.742 --> 06:30.141
They got what they wanted.
She's of no value anymore.

06:30.142 --> 06:31.414
You don't know that.

06:31.415 --> 06:33.034
Yes, I do.

06:35.456 --> 06:36.463
Where you going?

06:36.464 --> 06:38.680
To tell my mother.
She doesn't know yet.

06:38.681 --> 06:39.592
I'll go with.

06:39.593 --> 06:40.631
No.

06:42.746 --> 06:44.323
I need to do this alone.

06:48.836 --> 06:50.404
Castle may be right.

06:50.450 --> 06:52.195
Sara was the objective.

06:52.196 --> 06:54.137
Alexis is just a liability now.

06:54.138 --> 06:55.875
Then why didn't they bring
her to the exchange?

06:55.876 --> 06:58.410
The same reason they took
her-- a bargaining chip,

06:58.411 --> 07:00.227
insurance in case
something went wrong.

07:00.228 --> 07:02.173
Insurance they don't
need anymore.

07:02.174 --> 07:04.111
We'll keep moving forward.

07:04.112 --> 07:06.065
But we have to manage
expectations now.

07:06.066 --> 07:08.716
Agent Harris, I'm not gonna
manage expectations.

07:08.717 --> 07:10.238
I'll be solving a murder.

07:10.239 --> 07:12.074
The girls' kidnapper
Roger Henson

07:12.075 --> 07:13.315
was tortured and killed,

07:13.316 --> 07:14.880
most likely be the
people that hired him.

07:14.881 --> 07:17.355
We find those people,
we will find Alexis.

07:21.034 --> 07:22.604
Castle, it's me again.

07:22.605 --> 07:25.021
Can you just call me
when you get this?

07:30.234 --> 07:31.311
He still not answering?

07:31.312 --> 07:32.517
No.

07:33.367 --> 07:34.526
Thanks.

07:34.977 --> 07:36.597
You're welcome.
Any luck on the dead guy?

07:36.598 --> 07:39.501
Henson's been...
completely off the grid.

07:39.502 --> 07:41.620
I can't even find
a known address.

07:41.982 --> 07:43.721
All right, here's
what I don't get--

07:43.797 --> 07:45.551
How does a mid-level
narcotics smuggler

07:45.552 --> 07:47.680
get hooked up with a bunch
of Middle-Eastern radicals?

07:47.681 --> 07:48.903
Espo, I can't find a connection

07:48.904 --> 07:51.121
if I don't even know
where to start.

07:53.613 --> 07:55.127
How are you guys
doing on the planes?

07:55.405 --> 07:57.079
Ryan and I have been
through every flight plan

07:57.080 --> 07:59.784
of every private jet that's
departed from here to Albany,

07:59.785 --> 08:02.856
and only a couple of 'em filed
flight plans for France.

08:02.857 --> 08:03.843
So far,

08:03.844 --> 08:05.125
they all seem legit.

08:05.126 --> 08:07.470
So Ryan and I are gonna expand
our search in the morning.

08:11.288 --> 08:12.296
Kate.

08:12.786 --> 08:13.865
What?

08:14.619 --> 08:16.161
You should go.

08:19.554 --> 08:20.768
He needs you.

08:22.222 --> 08:23.383
Kate.

08:23.384 --> 08:25.324
Thank God.
Is there any news?

08:25.325 --> 08:28.549
Uh, no, not yet, but we are
doing everything that we can.

08:28.550 --> 08:30.137
Well, where's Richard?

08:31.754 --> 08:33.128
I thought that he was with you.

08:33.129 --> 08:34.597
No. He told me he was
gonna be with you,

08:34.597 --> 08:36.010
working on the case.

08:36.011 --> 08:38.381
Martha, I haven't
seen him all day.

08:39.337 --> 08:40.193
Oh, no.

08:40.195 --> 08:40.756
What?

08:40.756 --> 08:41.587
No.

08:42.979 --> 08:44.243
It's gone.

08:44.244 --> 08:45.078
What's gone?

08:45.079 --> 08:48.362
Oh, it's so stupid.
It's just stupid.

08:48.363 --> 08:49.934
Martha, what's going on?

08:50.680 --> 08:52.180
Pick up. Pick up.
Pick up. Pick up.

08:52.181 --> 08:52.812
Castle.

08:52.813 --> 08:54.523
Richard, where are you?

08:54.524 --> 08:56.154
I'm at the precinct with Beckett.
Why?

08:56.155 --> 08:57.791
Don't lie to me, Richard.

08:57.792 --> 09:00.198
Beckett is here.
Your passport is gone.

09:00.199 --> 09:02.441
Now what the hell do you
think you're doing?

09:02.541 --> 09:03.895
Getting my daughter back.

09:08.300 --> 09:13.315
Sync by YYeTs.com
Corrections by Alex1969

09:19.499 --> 09:21.501
Paris? What the hell
is he doing in Paris?

09:21.502 --> 09:22.846
He thinks that he can find her.

09:22.847 --> 09:24.179
What, so he's Liam Neeson now?

09:24.180 --> 09:26.133
Liam Neeson?
The dude's barely Ashley Judd.

09:26.134 --> 09:26.892
Look, in the state that he's in,

09:26.893 --> 09:28.381
who knows what he's capable of?

09:28.382 --> 09:30.680
But he says that he knows
someone that can help.

09:30.838 --> 09:32.104
You gonna go after him?

09:32.105 --> 09:33.620
And a lose a day
flying out there

09:33.621 --> 09:35.017
and another one
tracking him down

09:35.018 --> 09:37.184
in a place that I don't have
jurisdiction or authority?

09:37.185 --> 09:38.195
No.

09:38.673 --> 09:39.688
Look, he's...

09:39.689 --> 09:40.892
He's acting like a father,

09:40.893 --> 09:44.421
and... I have to act like a cop.

09:45.757 --> 09:47.490
Can you circle back
with the feds?

09:47.491 --> 09:49.769
Have 'em widen the search
to any private jets

09:49.770 --> 09:51.992
flying out to
anywhere in Europe.

09:51.993 --> 09:54.099
And, Ryan, I'm hitting a
wall with Roger Henson.

09:54.100 --> 09:56.073
You think you can reach out
to your guys in Narcotics?

09:56.074 --> 09:57.394
Maybe they heard something
on the streets.

09:57.395 --> 09:58.311
Yeah.

09:58.560 --> 09:59.969
Look, you guys, I
don't know who Castle

09:59.970 --> 10:01.575
thinks he knows.

10:02.285 --> 10:04.572
But let's find his daughter
before he does something stupid

10:04.573 --> 10:06.042
and gets himself killed.

10:07.648 --> 10:09.281
Merci, Colette.

10:09.587 --> 10:12.729
Et si jamais vous quittez
votre petit ami...

10:13.529 --> 10:14.802
Richard?

10:14.803 --> 10:16.233
Hello, Gaston.

10:17.021 --> 10:19.467
Richard, I am so terribly sorry.

10:19.796 --> 10:21.372
If there's anything I can do...

10:21.685 --> 10:23.248
You're still working
as an advisor

10:23.249 --> 10:25.268
to the minister of
defense, right?

10:25.269 --> 10:27.397
Yes, but that gives
me very little pull

10:27.398 --> 10:29.125
with the police nationale.

10:29.357 --> 10:30.519
Uh, I could make
inquiries, though.

10:30.520 --> 10:32.250
No. Um... I appreciate it.

10:32.251 --> 10:34.623
I'm not really looking for
a bureaucratic runaround.

10:34.624 --> 10:35.819
When you were advising me

10:35.820 --> 10:37.894
on those last few
Derrick Storm novels,

10:37.895 --> 10:39.834
you mentioned a man that
the French government

10:39.835 --> 10:41.052
would sometimes hire

10:41.053 --> 10:44.263
when they couldn't afford
to take official action.

10:44.264 --> 10:46.109
Ricky, I told you
that in confidence.

10:46.110 --> 10:47.838
But he exists?

10:48.622 --> 10:50.477
It is one thing to write
about these characters

10:50.478 --> 10:52.412
from the safety
of your own desk.

10:52.460 --> 10:54.703
But men like this,

10:55.122 --> 10:59.075
they are not the kind of
people you ever want to know.

11:01.448 --> 11:03.710
Beatrice--she must
be, what, 14 now?

11:03.874 --> 11:05.721
Patrice going on 9?

11:06.828 --> 11:09.035
I want you to think
about how it feels

11:09.207 --> 11:11.106
when you hug them,

11:12.009 --> 11:14.763
the look in their eye
when you come home.

11:16.222 --> 11:18.686
And now imagine them gone.

11:22.118 --> 11:23.276
He's expensive.

11:23.277 --> 11:24.248
I don't care.

11:26.331 --> 11:27.737
Gaston, please.

11:31.855 --> 11:33.449
Stay close to your phone.

11:38.675 --> 11:39.984
Yo, Beckett.

11:39.985 --> 11:42.918
They didn't fly to Paris,
at least not at first.

11:44.124 --> 11:46.117
FAA shows a Dassault Falcon

11:46.118 --> 11:48.080
departing Teterboro to Brussels

11:48.081 --> 11:49.702
18 hours after the
girls were taken.

11:49.703 --> 11:52.806
The plane was then designated
a Medical Angel Flight,

11:52.807 --> 11:55.230
transporting two young women
awaiting organ transplant

11:55.231 --> 11:56.563
from Brussels to Paris.

11:56.564 --> 11:57.717
Alexis and Sara.

11:57.718 --> 11:59.915
French immigration met the
plane and processed the girls

11:59.916 --> 12:01.644
before they were loaded
onto an ambulance.

12:01.645 --> 12:03.275
They were both
unconscious at the time.

12:03.276 --> 12:04.322
That's how they did it.

12:04.323 --> 12:05.640
What do we know about the plane?

12:05.641 --> 12:07.369
It's owned by one of those
Russian oligarchs--

12:07.370 --> 12:09.146
Uh, Vladimir Abramovich.

12:09.147 --> 12:10.999
And how is he connected
to the El-Masris?

12:11.000 --> 12:11.841
He's not.

12:11.842 --> 12:13.436
In fact, it's possible
he's not even involved.

12:13.437 --> 12:15.860
His plane was in
Paris under repairs.

12:15.861 --> 12:17.452
And none of his people
even knew it was taken.

12:17.453 --> 12:18.939
These people stole a jet?

12:18.940 --> 12:21.112
For a simple hostage exchange?

12:21.113 --> 12:22.221
That doesn't add up.

12:22.222 --> 12:24.385
Hey, so I talked to
my guys in Narcotics.

12:24.386 --> 12:25.469
Now they didn't
seem to know much

12:25.470 --> 12:27.197
about what Henson had
been into recently

12:27.198 --> 12:28.406
or where he'd been living,

12:28.407 --> 12:30.309
but they did know
something that we didn't.

12:30.514 --> 12:31.739
Henson had a girlfriend.

13:27.372 --> 13:29.497
"'Vengeance is mine,'
sayeth the Lord.

13:29.498 --> 13:30.543
'I will repay.'"

13:33.116 --> 13:33.930
But sometimes,

13:33.931 --> 13:36.100
the Lord needs a
little help, huh?

13:38.297 --> 13:39.220
Thank you for coming.

13:39.221 --> 13:40.839
Don't thank me yet.

13:41.305 --> 13:42.614
My terms.

13:42.891 --> 13:45.008
Half now.
Half when I find her.

13:45.066 --> 13:46.787
Can you find her?

13:46.788 --> 13:48.073
Yes.

13:49.333 --> 13:51.860
But I don't promise
to find her alive.

13:52.542 --> 13:55.638
That, I'm afraid, is
out of my control.

13:57.264 --> 13:58.825
Where do we start?

13:59.647 --> 14:01.167
I understand there
is a recording

14:01.168 --> 14:02.788
of a call she made to you.

14:02.789 --> 14:03.984
How did you...

14:07.071 --> 14:08.197
Yeah, there's a recording.

14:08.198 --> 14:09.744
I'll need a copy.

14:10.018 --> 14:11.785
There's nothing on it that
indicates where she is.

14:11.786 --> 14:13.345
And who told you that?

14:13.523 --> 14:15.176
The FBI.

14:15.430 --> 14:18.121
Well, then you thank
God I'm not the FBI.

14:26.707 --> 14:27.731
Come.

14:34.686 --> 14:35.550
Where are we going?

14:35.551 --> 14:36.987
To see a friend.

14:46.322 --> 14:47.714
Bonjour, Henri.

14:47.715 --> 14:49.019
Bonjour.

14:50.251 --> 14:52.375
Monsieur Castle, I presume.

14:52.434 --> 14:53.548
Yeah.

14:53.649 --> 14:55.850
And--and you are?

14:56.186 --> 14:57.568
We call him Le Taupe.

14:57.569 --> 14:58.665
The mole.

14:59.075 --> 15:00.318
Il est tendu, huh?

15:00.319 --> 15:02.908
- Mm. Pas mal.
- What?

15:02.909 --> 15:05.491
He says you're nervous.
He can hear your heart?

15:08.826 --> 15:10.486
What's out-- what's
outside the window?

15:10.487 --> 15:11.709
Nothing. Nothing.
I can't see anything.

15:11.710 --> 15:13.256
The windows are covered up.

15:15.368 --> 15:18.051
They're coming. They're coming.
They found out we're gone.

15:18.052 --> 15:20.096
Baby, get of there.
Get out of there now.

15:22.078 --> 15:24.404
I told you, there's
nothing on there.

15:24.405 --> 15:25.676
Nothing to see or hear.

15:25.677 --> 15:29.601
Ah. You listen with your eyes.
Shh.

15:41.258 --> 15:42.936
There. Hear that?

15:43.962 --> 15:44.877
No.

15:45.829 --> 15:46.939
Right there.

15:51.926 --> 15:53.327
Church bells.

15:53.964 --> 15:56.327
St. George's, in the 16th.

15:58.572 --> 15:59.890
From the sound of it,

15:59.891 --> 16:02.613
she's, uh, six,

16:02.710 --> 16:04.851
maybe eight blocks away.

16:04.979 --> 16:07.664
And there's a restaurant
in the building she's in.

16:07.665 --> 16:08.906
How can you tell that?

16:08.907 --> 16:12.919
Sounds, Mr. Castle,
are like fingerprints.

16:13.061 --> 16:14.682
No two are alike.

16:15.196 --> 16:16.994
Ah, that hum?

16:17.370 --> 16:20.225
It's from a restaurant
ventilation system,

16:20.226 --> 16:21.822
commercial grade,

16:22.302 --> 16:23.875
and, uh...

16:25.956 --> 16:27.738
It needs servicing.

16:28.241 --> 16:29.877
When was the last
time you slept?

16:30.519 --> 16:32.123
I-I don't know. I'm good.

16:32.124 --> 16:33.999
No, this will take some time.

16:34.000 --> 16:36.367
I will wake you when we
find something, huh?

16:47.605 --> 16:47.936
What's out--

16:47.937 --> 16:49.315
What's outside the window?

16:49.316 --> 16:50.482
They're coming.

16:53.637 --> 16:55.142
They're coming.
They found out we're gone.

16:55.143 --> 16:57.033
Baby, get out of there.
Get out of there now.

17:00.392 --> 17:01.184
Ms. Degarmo,

17:01.185 --> 17:02.917
I'm gonna ask you again.

17:02.918 --> 17:06.732
What else can you tell me
about Roger Henson's murder?

17:06.733 --> 17:08.002
I don't have to
tell you nothing.

17:08.002 --> 17:10.829
I know my rights.
You can't keep me here.

17:11.851 --> 17:13.281
He's dead,

17:13.595 --> 17:15.088
tortured.

17:15.612 --> 17:17.784
I'm just trying to find the
people that did it to him.

17:17.785 --> 17:19.188
Listen, bitch,

17:19.189 --> 17:21.045
I don't talk to cops.

17:21.046 --> 17:23.840
Now go get me my lawyer
and then go to hell--

17:25.076 --> 17:27.561
Do you have any idea
what this is all about?!

17:27.563 --> 17:29.115
You think I'm some beat cop

17:29.116 --> 17:31.253
busting you on
possession charges?

17:31.283 --> 17:33.109
My partner's
daughter is missing,

17:33.110 --> 17:34.016
and you...

17:36.601 --> 17:38.234
are in my way.

17:39.198 --> 17:41.189
Now you don't talk to cops?

17:41.378 --> 17:43.359
I'm not a cop today, honey.

17:44.232 --> 17:45.507
Who was he working for?

17:45.508 --> 17:46.938
He didn't say.

17:47.337 --> 17:48.360
Who's this guy?

17:48.361 --> 17:49.017
I don't know.

17:49.018 --> 17:49.926
What?

17:49.927 --> 17:53.021
But Roger got strange calls
in the middle of the night.

17:53.022 --> 17:53.988
People with accents.

17:53.989 --> 17:55.094
What kind of accents?

17:55.095 --> 17:56.811
- Foreign.
- What phone did he use?

17:56.812 --> 17:58.464
He didn't give me the number!

17:58.939 --> 18:00.835
Good. I believe you.

18:01.112 --> 18:02.685
Now you're gonna
give me his address.

18:06.894 --> 18:08.656
Looks like somebody
got here first.

18:11.980 --> 18:15.116
These people hired him
to kidnap those girls.

18:15.174 --> 18:17.413
So why would they
torture and murder him?

18:17.414 --> 18:19.237
Why would they toss this place?

18:19.238 --> 18:20.607
Maybe it wasn't the same guys.

18:20.608 --> 18:22.229
Who else is it gonna be?

18:22.230 --> 18:24.164
Check with the neighbors.
See if they saw anything.

18:24.165 --> 18:25.088
Yeah.

18:25.748 --> 18:28.013
Beckett, computer.

18:30.076 --> 18:31.107
Get it to Tech.

18:31.108 --> 18:33.068
Have them tear it apart.
Find me something,

18:33.069 --> 18:33.986
anything.

18:39.866 --> 18:40.792
What's going on?

18:40.793 --> 18:41.946
You found something?

18:41.947 --> 18:43.264
Maybe.

18:43.265 --> 18:44.619
Acoustic tiles,

18:44.620 --> 18:46.742
office space, close
to a rooftop--

18:46.743 --> 18:47.501
might fill the bill.

18:47.502 --> 18:48.202
I'm coming.

18:48.203 --> 18:50.308
No, no, no.
It might not be the place.

18:50.309 --> 18:51.034
I don't care.

18:51.035 --> 18:53.402
It could be the place.

18:54.920 --> 18:57.297
My daughter, my money.

18:57.310 --> 18:58.466
I'm coming.

20:07.594 --> 20:09.307
They were here.

20:10.653 --> 20:12.284
Not anymore.

20:28.270 --> 20:30.896
This is not the work
of typical kidnappers.

20:33.616 --> 20:34.797
The place is clean.

20:35.314 --> 20:36.312
It's too clean.

20:36.554 --> 20:38.106
This is tradecraft.

20:38.232 --> 20:39.934
Tradecraft as in spies?

20:39.935 --> 20:42.652
Whoever is behind this has
intelligence training.

20:42.753 --> 20:44.646
They left no trace.

20:44.647 --> 20:45.984
So how do we find 'em?

20:48.166 --> 20:49.698
You said you could find them--

21:13.162 --> 21:14.194
They're listening.

21:15.302 --> 21:17.763
So if the cops find this place,

21:17.764 --> 21:19.815
they stay ahead of
the investigation.

21:20.569 --> 21:22.081
Who are these people?

21:25.097 --> 21:26.271
Let's find out.

21:29.363 --> 21:30.709
I know you're out there.

21:31.248 --> 21:33.199
I know you're listening,
so you know I'm not a cop.

21:33.200 --> 21:36.684
I'm not interested in you,
your cause, or the law.

21:36.685 --> 21:38.119
All we want is the girl.

21:38.803 --> 21:40.162
You got what you wanted.

21:40.905 --> 21:43.457
Now she's meaningless
to you, but not to me.

21:43.458 --> 21:47.109
So if you're smart, you call,

21:47.235 --> 21:48.967
we discuss terms.

21:49.753 --> 21:51.392
But if you are stupid,

21:52.511 --> 21:54.743
then I will come for you.

21:55.166 --> 21:57.732
I expect by now you have
run voice recognition,

21:57.733 --> 21:59.976
so you know who I am,
you know my reputation,

21:59.977 --> 22:02.789
and you know what I will
do when I find you.

22:03.554 --> 22:05.055
The choice is yours.

22:25.378 --> 22:26.126
Oui.

22:28.370 --> 22:29.517
Venez seul.

22:33.440 --> 22:34.663
"Sans le père"?

22:34.878 --> 22:35.735
Without the father?

22:35.736 --> 22:37.923
Don't you see?
This is good news.

22:38.459 --> 22:40.735
They want to negotiate.
It means she's safe.

22:40.736 --> 22:42.267
You're not having that
meeting without me.

22:42.268 --> 22:43.697
You are emotionally compromised.

22:43.698 --> 22:45.457
That makes you like
an animal to them--

22:45.848 --> 22:48.347
unpredictable and dangerous.

22:50.086 --> 22:51.337
Monsieur Castle...

22:52.154 --> 22:53.538
This is what I do.

22:53.970 --> 22:55.528
It's what you pay me for.

22:56.655 --> 22:58.053
Now let me meet with them.

22:58.054 --> 23:00.794
Let me negotiate the terms.

23:03.756 --> 23:06.625
Oh, and of course they
will ask for more money.

23:07.005 --> 23:08.208
I need to know...

23:08.782 --> 23:10.729
How much can you afford?

23:14.651 --> 23:15.590
Yo, Beckett.

23:15.802 --> 23:17.829
One of Henson's neighbors saw
someone leaving his apartment

23:17.830 --> 23:18.920
two days back.

23:18.921 --> 23:20.301
We just got the sketch.

23:21.230 --> 23:23.285
That's the same dude who was
spotted leaving the farmhouse

23:23.286 --> 23:24.856
where Henson's body was found.

23:25.769 --> 23:27.026
First he tortures Henson,

23:27.027 --> 23:29.717
and then he trashes his place.
Why?

23:29.881 --> 23:31.668
Where are you with
Henson's hard drive?

23:31.866 --> 23:32.837
It's been erased,

23:32.838 --> 23:34.266
and not with
commercial software.

23:34.267 --> 23:36.033
Were you able to pull
anything from it?

23:36.034 --> 23:36.965
I'll do what I can,

23:36.966 --> 23:38.425
but I wouldn't get
your hopes up.

23:38.426 --> 23:41.074
Do it. We gotta figure out
what he was looking for.

23:44.034 --> 23:45.086
Don't worry.

23:46.219 --> 23:47.972
Henri always comes through.

23:48.587 --> 23:50.113
Shouldn't he be back by now?

23:50.165 --> 23:51.241
He is.

23:58.207 --> 23:59.141
Was she there?

23:59.142 --> 24:01.833
Yes, and she is safe.

24:02.242 --> 24:04.527
This is today's paper.

24:04.815 --> 24:05.802
Why did they take her?

24:05.803 --> 24:08.415
It was convenient, but they've
agreed to let her go.

24:08.416 --> 24:09.021
When?

24:09.022 --> 24:11.899
Later today, in the
forest of Fontainebleau.

24:12.173 --> 24:14.356
It will give you time to
get the money together.

24:37.052 --> 24:37.945
Detective Beckett!

24:39.506 --> 24:41.845
Henson was looking at these.

24:43.157 --> 24:44.471
Surveillance photos.

24:45.073 --> 24:47.889
Oh, God. Alexis.

24:47.890 --> 24:49.638
She wasn't at the wrong
place at the wrong time.

24:49.639 --> 24:50.929
She was the target.

25:47.163 --> 25:48.712
Where's Alexis?
I don't see her.

25:55.123 --> 25:56.417
Stay calm.

26:08.818 --> 26:10.985
No, no, no.
This isn't right.

26:12.388 --> 26:13.416
It's not right.

26:14.377 --> 26:15.525
Don't move.

26:20.021 --> 26:21.747
You're selling me out?
Why?

26:21.748 --> 26:23.882
I value my life
more than my word.

26:24.243 --> 26:26.192
If I had known who was really
holding your daughter,

26:26.193 --> 26:28.380
who your daughter really is...

26:28.381 --> 26:30.247
Who she really is?
Look, I-I don't understand.

26:30.248 --> 26:31.939
I would never have
taken the job.

26:31.940 --> 26:33.340
She's nobody.

26:36.853 --> 26:38.262
Attendez.

26:40.219 --> 26:41.410
Mon paiement?

27:02.996 --> 27:03.871
Wait. Okay, wait.

27:03.872 --> 27:06.180
Just... what do you want?

27:46.071 --> 27:47.405
If I'd wanted you dead,

27:47.413 --> 27:48.596
you'd be dead.

27:49.665 --> 27:51.978
You're the guy in the sketch.
You were at the farmhouse.

27:52.004 --> 27:53.108
That's right.

27:53.654 --> 27:55.538
Your friend there
was pretty good,

27:55.948 --> 27:57.513
but a bit out of his league.

27:58.375 --> 28:01.915
I am not surprised that he
crossed to the other side.

28:02.655 --> 28:04.000
You know what's going on here?

28:04.001 --> 28:05.363
You--do you know where
my daughter is?

28:05.364 --> 28:07.584
Look, we're exposed here.
We gotta go now.

28:07.585 --> 28:09.435
Go? What are you talking about?
Go where?

28:09.436 --> 28:11.406
Somewhere safe. Get in the car.

28:11.407 --> 28:13.324
No, not until you tell
me what's going on.

28:16.446 --> 28:19.433
Beckett, I am so
glad you called.

28:19.434 --> 28:20.929
Castle, Alexis wasn't

28:20.930 --> 28:21.937
taken by accident.

28:21.938 --> 28:24.336
She was the target.
They wanted her.

28:24.717 --> 28:26.071
Listen, I--

28:29.763 --> 28:31.991
What are you doing?!
That was a $200 phone.

28:31.992 --> 28:33.624
And that's how they track you.

28:33.625 --> 28:34.885
Now get in the car.

28:35.329 --> 28:37.805
Hey, I am not
getting in the car.

28:37.806 --> 28:40.223
Oh, don't be an idiot.
I'm the good guy.

28:40.224 --> 28:41.717
Oh, you expect me to trust you?

28:41.718 --> 28:43.423
Well, you're still
alive, aren't you?

28:44.388 --> 28:45.142
What are you gonna do,

28:45.143 --> 28:47.634
stay out here in the woods
with all the dead guys?

28:49.797 --> 28:50.601
Fine.

28:50.602 --> 28:51.664
I'll get in the car.

28:53.431 --> 28:54.817
Given how you're feeling so bad

28:54.818 --> 28:56.299
about your 200-buck phone,

28:56.300 --> 28:59.471
you might want to pick up
that $3-million briefcase.

29:04.258 --> 29:05.494
Take it with you.

29:19.468 --> 29:20.789
At least tell me your name.

29:21.255 --> 29:23.258
Hunt. Jackson Hunt.

29:23.596 --> 29:24.737
That sounds made up.

29:25.405 --> 29:26.332
It is.

29:56.090 --> 29:56.911
Hey!

29:57.446 --> 30:00.384
Hey, could someone just please
tell me what's going on?

30:00.385 --> 30:01.607
Why am I here?

30:20.273 --> 30:21.966
We should be safe here for now.

30:25.601 --> 30:27.007
Where did you get these?

30:27.385 --> 30:28.634
That's not important.

30:29.012 --> 30:31.719
You know what's important,
is we get her back.

30:31.720 --> 30:33.738
Well, I don't even know you.
Why would you care?

30:34.386 --> 30:36.255
It's my job. I was sent.

30:36.265 --> 30:37.705
By whom, the El-Masris?

30:37.706 --> 30:38.611
What's the difference?

30:38.612 --> 30:40.032
You need to tell
me who hired you

30:40.033 --> 30:42.139
and why these people
took my daughter.

30:44.027 --> 30:45.132
That's yours.

30:45.766 --> 30:46.757
You want to get it?

30:46.758 --> 30:48.890
How is it mine?
You shot mine.

30:48.891 --> 30:51.327
It's a clone.
That's how I tracked you.

30:51.328 --> 30:53.365
The difference is that
that one's secure.

30:53.366 --> 30:54.734
It's probably Beckett.

30:55.606 --> 30:57.584
You ought to let her
know you're safe.

30:59.614 --> 31:02.010
It's not Beckett.
It's a local number.

31:02.869 --> 31:03.845
Alexis.

31:04.238 --> 31:05.282
Alexis?

31:05.283 --> 31:07.360
I'm afraid not, Mr. Castle.

31:07.563 --> 31:09.509
But I am the one holding her.

31:10.085 --> 31:11.735
If you value her life,

31:11.746 --> 31:14.611
you will give the phone to the
man standing next to you,

31:14.612 --> 31:15.916
the one responsible

31:15.917 --> 31:18.216
for all the bloodshed
in the woods.

31:23.903 --> 31:24.782
Yeah?

31:25.268 --> 31:26.387
It's you.

31:27.219 --> 31:31.192
After all these years,
it's finally you.

31:31.299 --> 31:33.153
Time to let her go, Volkov.

31:33.242 --> 31:35.221
The way you let Anna go?

31:35.809 --> 31:39.783
No.
It's time to end things.

31:39.945 --> 31:41.188
A life

31:41.578 --> 31:42.995
for a life.

31:44.729 --> 31:46.846
Tomorrow, 6:00 AM.

31:47.115 --> 31:49.263
Outside the Palais Bourbon.

31:49.452 --> 31:52.243
If you show, I'll spare her.

31:52.244 --> 31:53.476
But if you don't,

31:53.867 --> 31:57.720
I will put a bullet in her
brain instead of yours,

31:58.116 --> 31:59.938
and we start again.

32:05.320 --> 32:06.679
This is about you?

32:07.320 --> 32:08.356
Yeah.

32:09.056 --> 32:10.245
I don't understand.

32:10.246 --> 32:11.570
What does this have
to do with Alexis?

32:11.571 --> 32:12.730
Why would they take her?

32:12.731 --> 32:14.365
Because I was careless.

32:14.366 --> 32:17.717
Because somehow he found out
who she was, who you were,

32:17.718 --> 32:19.092
and he knew I'd come for her.

32:19.093 --> 32:20.682
Why?
Why would you come for her?

32:20.683 --> 32:22.482
Because she's my granddaughter.

32:24.983 --> 32:25.865
Richard,

32:26.621 --> 32:27.978
I'm your father.

32:38.024 --> 32:39.774
You're telling me you're a spy?

32:39.775 --> 32:42.436
"Intelligence asset"
is the term.

32:44.700 --> 32:46.101
My dad's a spy.

32:47.115 --> 32:48.395
Does my mom know?

32:50.647 --> 32:52.201
What did she tell you about me?

32:54.060 --> 32:56.348
Uh, that it was a special night.

32:56.349 --> 32:58.503
She was in love.

32:59.119 --> 33:00.747
She woke up the next
morning, you were gone.

33:00.748 --> 33:02.214
She never saw you again.

33:05.377 --> 33:06.483
Yeah, that night,

33:07.517 --> 33:09.401
I had just finished
a job at the UN.

33:09.402 --> 33:10.838
Least I thought I had.

33:11.001 --> 33:13.444
And the next day,
things went south.

33:13.846 --> 33:15.687
I had to get out
of the city fast.

33:15.688 --> 33:18.232
It was a year before I
was stateside again.

33:19.373 --> 33:21.429
That's when I found
out about you.

33:22.140 --> 33:23.642
You've known about me...

33:24.443 --> 33:26.054
about us, all these years,

33:26.055 --> 33:28.884
and you never once let us
know you were out there?

33:29.030 --> 33:31.952
What I do means
no communication,

33:31.953 --> 33:34.170
no relationships, to anyone.

33:34.486 --> 33:37.082
But... hey, I've been around.

33:37.121 --> 33:38.503
We've met before.

33:39.144 --> 33:40.243
Yeah.

33:40.287 --> 33:41.559
When you were about
10 years old,

33:41.560 --> 33:43.219
your mother took you
to the library,

33:43.220 --> 33:46.392
and you were looking
for a book and, uh,

33:46.502 --> 33:47.750
I gave you a copy of, uh--

33:47.751 --> 33:49.097
"Casino Royale."

33:50.578 --> 33:51.744
Yeah.

33:52.060 --> 33:53.325
That was you?

33:57.296 --> 33:59.244
That book made me want
to become a writer.

33:59.245 --> 34:01.873
I couldn't believe it when I
read your first spy novel.

34:01.874 --> 34:02.752
You read my books?

34:02.753 --> 34:04.756
Oh, yeah.
I greased some wheels at the CIA

34:04.757 --> 34:06.174
when you were trying
to get access

34:06.175 --> 34:08.487
to some information
for research.

34:09.063 --> 34:10.231
I know that's not much,

34:10.232 --> 34:11.870
but for a minute there...

34:12.668 --> 34:14.514
it made me feel like a father.

34:15.270 --> 34:18.520
No, I've been, uh, checking
on you and your mom

34:18.652 --> 34:19.928
and Alexis

34:20.197 --> 34:21.601
your whole lives.

34:23.003 --> 34:25.293
This man who has my
daughter, who is he?

34:25.295 --> 34:26.428
Gregor Volkov?

34:26.429 --> 34:28.379
The KGB's most feared agent.

34:28.380 --> 34:29.562
I killed his wife Anna,

34:29.563 --> 34:31.077
a counter-intelligence
operative,

34:31.078 --> 34:33.915
12 years ago in an
operation here in Paris.

34:33.983 --> 34:35.341
The first time he came after me,

34:35.342 --> 34:37.860
I put him away in a
Chechen prison for life.

34:37.862 --> 34:39.996
Then... he escaped.

34:39.996 --> 34:41.489
And he's been trying
to figure out a way

34:41.491 --> 34:43.270
to draw me out ever since.

34:43.527 --> 34:44.967
If this was about Alexis,

34:44.967 --> 34:46.476
why would he take
the other girl?

34:46.478 --> 34:48.235
Because if he just took Alexis,

34:48.237 --> 34:50.542
it wouldn't be
international news.

34:50.630 --> 34:54.000
He needed somebody high-profile.
He needed me to know.

34:54.429 --> 34:56.659
And now he's got me exactly
where he wants me.

34:56.661 --> 34:59.022
If I don't show up tomorrow,
he will kill her.

35:00.157 --> 35:01.344
And if you do show up?

35:01.345 --> 35:03.086
He'll kill us both just for fun.

35:06.798 --> 35:09.362
If you know me at all, you
know I'll do anything.

35:12.407 --> 35:13.847
Then our only advantage is

35:13.848 --> 35:15.865
Volkov doesn't know
I've found him.

35:16.703 --> 35:19.225
He may not be prepared
for a direct assault.

35:19.226 --> 35:20.949
If I can get inside
his compound,

35:20.950 --> 35:22.400
I can get Alexis out.

35:22.401 --> 35:23.643
A direct assault?

35:23.813 --> 35:26.004
This is our best
shot, her best shot.

35:26.005 --> 35:28.672
But we need a
tactical advantage.

35:29.246 --> 35:31.042
I can't do this alone.

35:34.355 --> 35:35.656
Tell me what you need.

35:37.700 --> 35:38.952
Where she's being held,

35:39.599 --> 35:41.087
there's a conduit supplying it

35:41.088 --> 35:42.903
that runs through the
old sewer system.

35:42.904 --> 35:44.941
You cut those cables,
you cut their power.

35:44.942 --> 35:47.502
Lights, alarm, security video--

35:47.503 --> 35:49.024
that conduit's the key.

35:50.583 --> 35:51.854
What do you say, kid?

35:52.785 --> 35:54.623
You been playing cop for years.

35:55.256 --> 35:56.863
You ready to play spy?

36:15.707 --> 36:16.801
How are we doing?

36:17.153 --> 36:18.518
Yeah, I'm almost there.

36:18.866 --> 36:20.185
You should see a junction box

36:20.186 --> 36:22.442
with six conduits
coming from it.

36:24.082 --> 36:25.179
I see it.

36:27.205 --> 36:30.066
The one you want is the
third one from the bottom.

36:30.641 --> 36:31.634
Got it.

36:33.172 --> 36:35.438
Wrap the charge around
it like I showed you

36:35.439 --> 36:37.347
and then attach the detonator.

36:41.029 --> 36:43.494
All right. I'm setting the
detonator for 30 seconds...

36:43.862 --> 36:44.995
Now.

36:51.157 --> 36:52.084
Hey.

36:52.362 --> 36:53.424
Don't move.

36:56.168 --> 36:57.702
We may have a problem.

37:09.564 --> 37:10.529
Dad?

37:11.269 --> 37:11.968
Dad.

37:11.969 --> 37:13.014
Alexis?

37:13.999 --> 37:14.543
Alexis.

37:14.544 --> 37:16.415
- Dad. Dad!
- Alexis.

37:17.213 --> 37:18.343
Alexis.

37:18.344 --> 37:19.266
Hey.

37:20.493 --> 37:21.501
You okay?

37:21.802 --> 37:24.825
Yeah, but...
what are you doing here?

37:25.306 --> 37:26.586
Did they kidnap you, too?

37:26.687 --> 37:28.627
Uh... yeah.

37:28.628 --> 37:31.211
Trying to... rescue you.

37:31.930 --> 37:32.953
You shouldn't be here.

37:32.954 --> 37:35.629
Shh. It's okay.
We're together now.

37:35.706 --> 37:36.975
It's gonna be okay.

37:38.692 --> 37:39.819
You--you look good.

37:41.869 --> 37:44.724
You are like your father,
Mr. Castle.

37:45.492 --> 37:48.386
Getting involved where
you don't belong.

37:51.153 --> 37:52.391
Did he really think

37:52.392 --> 37:54.821
I would not prepared
for an attack?

37:55.565 --> 37:57.345
Dad, what's he talking about?

37:58.039 --> 37:59.147
Tell her.

37:59.669 --> 38:02.892
Go on.
Tell her why she's here.

38:04.399 --> 38:05.610
You have me now.

38:06.247 --> 38:08.261
She's of no use to you.
Let her go.

38:08.312 --> 38:10.057
When a man doubles his wealth,

38:10.904 --> 38:12.780
why should he give
half of it away?

38:14.570 --> 38:15.957
He had this on him.

38:18.661 --> 38:20.025
Time to end this.

38:22.368 --> 38:23.920
I know that you are here.

38:24.914 --> 38:26.531
I know that you are close.

38:27.873 --> 38:29.355
And I want you to know

38:30.163 --> 38:31.641
that I have your son.

38:32.930 --> 38:35.794
You have ten seconds
to show yourself

38:35.795 --> 38:37.476
to my men out front.

38:37.599 --> 38:39.145
Give yourself up...

38:41.106 --> 38:42.503
or I will kill him.

38:42.938 --> 38:44.038
Dad.

38:44.104 --> 38:45.255
It's okay.

38:46.845 --> 38:47.988
Ten...

38:50.558 --> 38:51.580
Nine...

38:52.231 --> 38:53.178
Eight...

38:54.169 --> 38:55.591
- Seven...
- I'm sorry.

38:55.667 --> 38:56.956
- It's all right.
- Six...

38:57.829 --> 38:58.867
Five...

39:00.153 --> 39:01.278
Four...

39:02.123 --> 39:04.654
- Three... 
- You're not gonna kill my son, Volkov.

39:05.343 --> 39:06.556
No?

39:07.078 --> 39:08.456
And why is that?

39:09.033 --> 39:10.512
Because you'll be dead.

39:12.217 --> 39:13.286
Get down.

39:15.907 --> 39:17.308
Once the charge goes off,

39:17.309 --> 39:19.431
there'll be a moment when
it all hits the fan.

39:20.481 --> 39:21.914
Use this to get her out.

39:23.726 --> 39:24.898
Close your eyes, sweetheart.

39:26.411 --> 39:27.556
And then run.

39:28.389 --> 39:29.295
Go.

39:29.750 --> 39:30.692
Let's go.

39:32.441 --> 39:33.579
His men will move to the front

39:33.580 --> 39:35.054
to respond to my attack.

39:35.352 --> 39:36.415
You move to the back,

39:36.416 --> 39:37.204
through these doors

39:37.205 --> 39:38.972
and right down this corridor.

39:39.258 --> 39:40.183
And what about his men?

39:40.184 --> 39:41.199
What if they try to stop us?

39:41.200 --> 39:42.494
Don't let them.

39:43.720 --> 39:45.740
Just keep moving until
you hit the back door

39:45.741 --> 39:47.469
'cause I'll be
coming in the front.

39:47.666 --> 39:49.869
Don't stop running, ever...

39:53.083 --> 39:55.183
Not until you reach
the US embassy.

40:03.264 --> 40:04.874
And once you reach the embassy,

40:04.875 --> 40:08.028
ask for Deputy Chief of
Missions Jim Aldacott.

40:08.029 --> 40:11.169
And he'll provide you both
with an official cover story.

40:11.598 --> 40:14.531
One that credits Interpol
and the French police

40:14.532 --> 40:16.046
and doesn't include me.

40:16.152 --> 40:17.474
What happens to you after?

40:17.475 --> 40:19.381
Assuming...
we're both not killed,

40:19.382 --> 40:20.779
I-I disappear.

40:22.756 --> 40:23.859
No, but we just--

40:23.860 --> 40:26.612
That's the job.
That's my life.

40:26.613 --> 40:29.251
Yeah, but, uh... we just met.

40:29.252 --> 40:30.881
I mean, I got a
lot of questions,

40:31.132 --> 40:32.295
a lot of things I want to say.

40:32.296 --> 40:33.403
I don't--I don't...

40:34.588 --> 40:36.436
I-I need to have more time.

40:38.008 --> 40:40.393
Maybe we can do that sometime,

40:40.394 --> 40:41.765
you know, someday.

40:44.764 --> 40:46.071
How will I know if you made it?

40:46.072 --> 40:48.199
Oh, you won't.
Not officially at least.

40:50.841 --> 40:54.651
I know this has been tough
for you, Richard, and...

40:56.312 --> 40:58.314
I just want you to know, son,

40:58.961 --> 41:00.719
I've always been proud of you.

41:02.605 --> 41:03.791
Always.

41:20.244 --> 41:22.967
I have never in my life
been so happy to be home.

41:23.195 --> 41:24.228
Amen.

41:25.326 --> 41:26.931
I know we're not
supposed to talk about

41:26.932 --> 41:28.416
what really happened, but...

41:29.441 --> 41:31.427
Thank you for everything.

41:31.741 --> 41:34.666
Hey, it's what fathers do.

41:35.897 --> 41:37.172
You think he made it out?

41:38.835 --> 41:40.042
I wish I knew.

41:43.283 --> 41:44.431
You ready?

41:50.185 --> 41:51.866
You're back!

41:51.867 --> 41:54.751
- You're back! Ohh.
- It's great to be home.

41:54.752 --> 41:56.029
I'm so glad you're okay.

41:58.627 --> 42:01.144
Please don't do anything
like that again without me.

42:02.356 --> 42:03.580
I won't.

42:05.226 --> 42:07.122
It's okay, gram. I'm okay.

42:07.123 --> 42:08.070
Ohh.

42:09.391 --> 42:10.428
Honey, hi.

42:10.646 --> 42:11.474
Come here.

42:11.475 --> 42:13.070
You are brilliant.

42:13.071 --> 42:15.203
Just bril--everybody
must be starving.

42:15.204 --> 42:17.061
Come on. I've made breakfast.

42:17.062 --> 42:17.992
Ohh.

42:22.931 --> 42:23.849
Mother, what's this?

42:23.850 --> 42:25.523
Oh, it came for
you this morning.

42:25.524 --> 42:26.802
Why, is it important?

42:40.212 --> 42:41.227
Mom...

42:42.033 --> 42:44.034
There's something I
want to tell you.
