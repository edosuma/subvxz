00:12.887 --> 00:15.223
Hi, welcome to Bayview.

00:15.265 --> 00:18.059
I'm Keely,
your designated tour guide.

00:18.101 --> 00:19.352
- Nice to meet you.

00:19.394 --> 00:21.146
Um, but I thought someone
named Walt

00:21.187 --> 00:22.731
was supposed to show me around.

00:22.772 --> 00:25.025
- Oh, nobody told you?

00:25.066 --> 00:26.651
Walt's home sick.

00:26.693 --> 00:28.528
Pneumonia, I think.

00:28.570 --> 00:32.866
- But the officer said
that he was on his way.

00:32.907 --> 00:35.243
- Yeah, um...

00:35.285 --> 00:38.788
Walt's in Bio,
and I'm a terrible liar.

00:38.830 --> 00:41.166
I asked if I could
trade tours with him

00:41.207 --> 00:43.793
because I'm sort of a fan,
but...

00:43.835 --> 00:45.587
- So you're into baseball?

00:45.628 --> 00:48.923
- Well, I have
a lot of interests.

- No worries, Cooper.

01:03.438 --> 01:06.274
- Your reputation precedes you.

01:06.316 --> 01:08.026

about the baseball messiah

01:08.068 --> 01:10.195
from Mississippi.

01:11.446 --> 01:13.365
- Okay. Who is that?

01:13.406 --> 01:15.241
- That was Simon Kelleher,

Look, all I'm saying is,

02:06.710 --> 02:08.420
if you really wanted him
to listen,

02:08.461 --> 02:11.047
you could have at least spent
some time on your makeup.

02:11.089 --> 02:12.465
- Wow, Mom.

02:12.507 --> 02:14.884
- I'm telling you
'cause I love you.

I'm honestly worried about her.

I mean, he's obviously
gonna break up with her.

bad telenovelas?

04:08.081 --> 04:10.625

04:10.667 --> 04:14.504
- You laughed so hard,

04:14.546 --> 04:16.715
and went all over
Tony's carpet.

04:16.756 --> 04:18.299

I had a chance, dude.

10:03.812 --> 10:05.271
- I think she'd rather
I didn't tell you guys that.

10:05.313 --> 10:06.981
- Oh, sure.
You're a regular Boy Scout.

10:07.023 --> 10:08.733
- I was once, actually.
Sixth grade.

10:08.775 --> 10:10.151
- Oh, my God! Who cares?

10:10.193 --> 10:11.820
We have to figure out
who's posting the secrets.

10:11.861 --> 10:13.655
- Well, we know
it's not me or Nate.

10:13.697 --> 10:15.281
So that leaves the two of you,

10:15.323 --> 10:16.366
and one of you seems like

10:16.408 --> 10:17.826
she'd be a little better
at computers.

10:17.867 --> 10:19.285
No offense, Cooper.

10:19.327 --> 10:21.287
- Why are you assuming
it's one of us?

10:21.329 --> 10:23.123
It could literally be anyone
with the password.

10:23.164 --> 10:24.332
- Who would have the password?

10:24.374 --> 10:25.834
- What about Janae?

10:25.875 --> 10:27.502
She was Simon's best friend.

10:27.544 --> 10:29.838
Maybe she's taken over
as some sort of, I don't know,

10:29.879 --> 10:31.172

pointing the finger

10:32.257 --> 10:33.133
at other people?

10:33.174 --> 10:34.968
First Ms. Avery, now Janae.

10:35.010 --> 10:36.469
- Do you want me to point
the finger at someone here?

10:36.511 --> 10:37.595
Because I could.

10:37.637 --> 10:38.680
I could especially
point the finger

10:38.722 --> 10:39.889
at the mysterious guy

10:39.931 --> 10:41.141
who's only been here
for a year,

10:41.182 --> 10:42.851
who went
to the nurse's office alone

10:42.892 --> 10:44.352
and didn't find Simon's EpiPens

10:44.394 --> 10:46.396

to point the finger at me.

10:46.438 --> 10:47.731
You wanna play that game?

10:47.772 --> 10:49.691
- I just think it's likely
that whoever is doing it

10:49.733 --> 10:52.152
is posting from Simon's laptop,
and since the laptop

10:52.193 --> 10:53.695
was in detention
with the four of us,

10:53.737 --> 10:55.155
I know I didn't take it,
and these two

you came to me,

I didn't know
they were gonna suspend you.

19:54.944 --> 19:56.613

19:56.655 --> 19:58.490
Three weeks
of surf and smoke, right?

19:58.531 --> 19:59.741
You know what?
I actually probably

19:59.783 --> 20:00.742
didn't even want
to go to college,

20:00.784 --> 20:02.160
so really, it's totally cool

20:02.202 --> 20:04.412
that you lied
to protect your ex-boyfriend.

20:04.454 --> 20:06.998

- What?

20:07.040 --> 20:09.084
- He had a pretty good reason
to hit you.

20:09.125 --> 20:11.920
I mean, what we did hurt him
worse than he hurt you.

20:11.961 --> 20:13.797
And I need
to make it up to him.

see yourself like I see you...

the best you can do.

21:12.105 --> 21:13.314
You think I'm doping?

21:13.356 --> 21:15.025
- I didn't say that.

- You know I would never
do anything

21:17.110 --> 21:18.528

that we've worked so hard for.

for feeling like sometimes

I don't know you?

21:32.208 --> 21:34.169

44:18.658 --> 44:20.535
Whoo! Love you, bro.

44:20.577 --> 44:22.620
- You get it, bro.

44:22.662 --> 44:23.788

- Yes, man.

44:23.830 --> 44:25.915
You fuckin' brought it.
- Thank you, bro.

- Keely!

44:27.959 --> 44:31.212

- Aww! Thank you!

44:31.838 --> 44:34.382
Wait, I saw you talking
with the detective.

44:34.424 --> 44:35.550
What'd she want?

44:35.592 --> 44:36.885
- She was asking me
about your post.

44:36.926 --> 44:38.678
The steroids.

44:38.720 --> 44:40.680
And I told her you're taking
a test after this.

44:40.722 --> 44:42.223
So don't even worry about it.

44:42.265 --> 44:43.725

can I get a picture?

Kris, wait.

45:13.171 --> 45:14.923
Why'd you come?

45:14.964 --> 45:17.467
- Because you made such
a big deal about this thing.

45:17.509 --> 45:19.344
I wanted to come
and support you.

45:19.386 --> 45:22.055
I even came
in straight cosplay for you.

45:22.097 --> 45:23.139
I'm wearing plaid.

45:23.181 --> 45:25.433
- I have a plan, remember?

45:25.475 --> 45:27.102
- No, you have a girlfriend.

45:27.143 --> 45:28.645
- Yeah, and she's in on it too.

45:28.687 --> 45:30.855
Look, she helps me,
and I help her.

45:30.897 --> 45:32.023
I scared away her crazy ex.

45:32.065 --> 45:34.901
- And your dad knows too?

45:34.943 --> 45:37.779
- What? No. No, he doesn't.

45:37.821 --> 45:41.950
- You said you were only
in the closet for baseball.

45:41.992 --> 45:43.493
You lied.

45:43.535 --> 45:44.995

45:45.036 --> 45:46.538
- Cooper, you're better
at lying

45:46.579 --> 45:49.207

at throwing a ball.

45:50.375 --> 45:52.502
You're great
at being different people,

45:52.544 --> 45:54.587
and I don't know
what to do with that.

45:54.629 --> 45:55.964
I'm always me.

45:56.006 --> 45:57.590
I only know how to be myself.

46:00.635 --> 46:03.972
I'm sorry.
This is so stupid.

46:04.014 --> 46:05.557
I always fall
