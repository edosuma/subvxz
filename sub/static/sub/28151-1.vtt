00:51.708 --> 00:52.643
Can I come in?

01:10.093 --> 01:11.061
I really am sorry.

01:14.731 --> 01:16.601
I made an appointment
with a counselor

01:17.468 --> 01:19.436
and we can go when you get back.

01:25.209 --> 01:26.611
You are coming back?

02:43.887 --> 02:44.755
I gotta pee.

02:46.155 --> 02:48.223
Jesus Steve, how long
have we been driving?

02:48.225 --> 02:50.695
10 hours and 42 minutes.

02:51.929 --> 02:54.028
What, are we
going to the North Pole?

02:54.030 --> 02:57.198
Keep your dick in your
pants, we'll be there soon.

02:57.200 --> 02:58.766
Mac keep his
dick in his pants?

02:58.768 --> 02:59.634
Yeah right.

02:59.636 --> 03:01.069
Fuck off, Dave.

03:01.071 --> 03:03.137
He's
got a point there.

03:03.139 --> 03:04.041
Fuck you, too!

03:13.183 --> 03:16.083
Mm, alright, a man and
a woman are having sex

03:16.085 --> 03:17.586
in a really dark forest.

03:17.588 --> 03:19.020
Much like the
forest we're in now.

03:19.022 --> 03:21.058
Shut up, Josh, I'm
telling a joke here!

03:22.091 --> 03:24.759
Now after 15 minutes, the
guy steps up and says,

03:24.761 --> 03:27.228
shit, I wish I had a flashlight!

03:27.230 --> 03:29.931
Then the woman says, Yeah, I
wish I had a flashlight, too.

03:29.933 --> 03:32.801
You've been eating
grass for 10 minutes.

03:32.803 --> 03:34.939
Wait, why was he eating grass?

03:38.608 --> 03:40.241
Alright, three guys
go to this cabin,

03:40.243 --> 03:43.177
but there aren't enough rooms,
so they have to share a bed.

03:43.179 --> 03:44.178
Next morning, they wake up.

03:44.180 --> 03:46.213
Guy on the right says,
I had this great dream

03:46.215 --> 03:48.116
that I was getting a handjob.

03:48.118 --> 03:50.986
Guy on the left says,
crazy, I had the same dream.

03:50.988 --> 03:53.220
I was getting this
great handjob.

03:53.222 --> 03:55.790
The guy in the middle
wakes up bushy-eyed and says,

03:55.792 --> 03:58.360
guys, I had this great dream
that I went skiing last night.

04:00.130 --> 04:02.132
I don't want any of you
guys sleeping with me.

04:04.201 --> 04:05.634
Steve, I gotta pee.

04:05.636 --> 04:07.004
What are you, pregnant?

04:21.118 --> 04:22.219
Well howdy.

04:23.387 --> 04:25.589
Hey guys, what
can I get for you?

04:26.423 --> 04:27.291
Feels like I...

04:28.759 --> 04:30.127
Stepped into a movie.

04:32.262 --> 04:34.128
Did you come here
to decorate or drink?

04:34.130 --> 04:35.029
I vote for drinking.

04:35.031 --> 04:36.330
Oh, good choice.

04:36.332 --> 04:38.799
Jesus, can we get
a fucking drink?

04:38.801 --> 04:40.267
Four whiskeys, straight up.

04:40.269 --> 04:41.402
You got it.

04:41.404 --> 04:42.770
I gotta use the
bathroom, please.

04:42.772 --> 04:44.107
Shitter's in the back.

04:50.346 --> 04:52.681
So, where you all heading.

04:52.683 --> 04:54.181
Hunting trip.

04:54.183 --> 04:56.885
Two
legs or four legs?

04:58.187 --> 04:59.453
What do you guys
do around here?

04:59.455 --> 05:00.323
Drink.

05:01.158 --> 05:02.323
Fuck.

05:02.325 --> 05:04.027
Sounds like my kinda town.

05:37.226 --> 05:39.094
Nice song, faggot.

06:02.219 --> 06:05.022
Hm, guess she wasn't kidding.

06:06.089 --> 06:07.488
Couple of beers.

06:07.490 --> 06:08.358
Sure.

06:19.401 --> 06:23.238
Fucking Mac!

06:23.240 --> 06:25.175
I'm gonna go give,
um, Maggie a call.

06:26.877 --> 06:28.179
You keep an eye on him, okay?

06:29.378 --> 06:30.714
No problem Steve.

06:40.457 --> 06:43.060
You know the ladies
room is right next door?

06:55.839 --> 06:57.371
Hey, it's
Maggie, sorry I missed you.

06:57.373 --> 06:59.407
Leave me a message, though,
and I'll call you right back.

07:00.310 --> 07:02.379
Hey Maggie, it's me.

07:03.445 --> 07:08.451
I figured you wouldn't
answer.

07:12.022 --> 07:13.457
I just wanted to call
and say I'm sorry.

07:16.091 --> 07:18.459
So I, um, hear you
guys like to drink

07:18.461 --> 07:19.764
and fuck around here?

07:26.303 --> 07:28.335
You talk too much.

07:29.973 --> 07:32.106
What the fuck are
you doing with my lady?

07:32.108 --> 07:34.375
Oh Ed, calm down, we're
just having some fun.

07:34.377 --> 07:35.375
I'm not talking to you, bitch.

07:35.377 --> 07:39.414
Whoa, who you
calling a bitch, bitch?

07:39.416 --> 07:40.317
Well punch him, Ed!

07:41.450 --> 07:43.119
You gotta get in here, Steve!

07:44.486 --> 07:45.455
Right now, Steve!

07:49.491 --> 07:53.361
Hey, nobody's
punching anybody, Ed.

07:53.363 --> 07:55.029
Hey hey hey, whoa
whoa whoa, wait now.

07:55.031 --> 07:56.330
Just, hey, just, everyone
just take it easy.

07:58.067 --> 07:59.900
You fucking assholes!

07:59.902 --> 08:01.469
You take your shit outside

08:01.471 --> 08:04.505
before I fill you
full of lead holes!

08:04.507 --> 08:05.910
We just, we're going.

08:07.476 --> 08:09.479
Okay, we're just, we're leaving.

08:10.447 --> 08:12.447
Yeah, you're leaving.

08:14.017 --> 08:16.553
Thank you so much for
all of your hospitality.

08:24.526 --> 08:26.895
What the fuck?

09:16.680 --> 09:18.413
Ahhh!

09:18.415 --> 09:19.950
Where the hell are we?

09:21.251 --> 09:22.386
Where nobody can find us.

09:25.555 --> 09:28.358
Beautiful, great spot, Steve.

09:31.560 --> 09:33.363
Our palace for
the weekend, boys.

09:34.730 --> 09:36.566
Glad its to your
liking, gentlemen.

09:50.579 --> 09:52.746
Do we have to
play for real money?

09:52.748 --> 09:54.250
Oh, Jesus Christ, Josh.

09:55.618 --> 09:56.552
Don't be such a pussy.

09:57.653 --> 09:59.587
Well, how much is it?

09:59.589 --> 10:00.457
How much you bring?

10:03.759 --> 10:05.128
$500.

10:06.563 --> 10:07.431
That'll work!

10:15.604 --> 10:16.606
Ante up, ladies.

10:18.141 --> 10:19.774
This is, this is nice.

10:19.776 --> 10:22.443
This is cozy.

10:22.445 --> 10:24.345
Alright,
flip 'em over Steve.

10:24.347 --> 10:26.116
Texas Hold 'Em, bitches.

10:26.749 --> 10:30.650
Okay so, this is poker, right?

10:30.652 --> 10:32.020
Yeah, it's poker, Josh.

10:33.089 --> 10:35.188
It's what you haven't done
with your wife in years.

10:36.626 --> 10:37.692
Ha ha ha, how would you
know what I do with my wife?

10:37.694 --> 10:39.029
He's just fucking
with you, Josh.

10:39.695 --> 10:41.395
Alright, $100 ladies.

10:41.397 --> 10:43.297
A hundred dollars?

10:43.299 --> 10:44.168
Just bet.

10:48.805 --> 10:50.507
You're a fucking bluffer, Mac.

10:51.807 --> 10:53.673
It's too rich for my blood.

10:53.675 --> 10:55.345
How chickenshit.

10:57.213 --> 10:58.612
Seven of hearts.

10:58.614 --> 11:01.682
Seven of hearts,
alright, another hundred.

11:01.684 --> 11:03.351
You know, there
really should be a limit

11:03.353 --> 11:04.555
to how much we can bet.

11:06.790 --> 11:07.658
Alright.

11:14.263 --> 11:17.531
Last card, Jacky Jack.

11:17.533 --> 11:18.698
Pass.

11:18.700 --> 11:20.735
I knew it, you got dick, Matt.

11:22.272 --> 11:24.507
You are looking
at the big winner.

11:25.642 --> 11:27.341
200.

11:27.343 --> 11:30.280
What, just a second ago, you
said we should have a limit.

11:32.748 --> 11:37.253
Okay, I'll see your two
hundred and raise you a hundred.

11:41.690 --> 11:44.324
Two pair, Jacks and sevens.

11:43.358 --> 11:45.193
Josh, what the
fuck are you doing?

11:45.195 --> 11:46.760
Dave should throw down first.

11:46.762 --> 11:47.631
Oh, alright.

11:49.465 --> 11:50.334
Go ahead.

11:51.600 --> 11:53.603
Your hard-on
moment is over, Josh.

11:54.570 --> 11:57.704
Aces and 10s,
gents, come to papa!

11:57.706 --> 11:59.707
Keep the hard on
in your pants, Dave.

11:59.709 --> 12:02.709
We're not over yet,
because there's one, two,

12:02.711 --> 12:05.746
three little beauties,
three threes.

12:05.748 --> 12:06.713
Holy shit!

12:06.715 --> 12:08.749
That's what winning
looks like, fellas.

12:08.751 --> 12:10.784
Oh my God, oh my God!

12:10.786 --> 12:12.455
I just lost $500.

12:16.859 --> 12:18.327
Fuck this game!

12:19.728 --> 12:22.163
Welcome to poker!

12:22.165 --> 12:23.698
Oh my God, Oh my God.

12:23.700 --> 12:24.698
Give me your fucking cards.

12:25.868 --> 12:26.737
Oh!

12:37.479 --> 12:38.348
Hey man.

12:43.752 --> 12:45.656
How you doing, Steve?

12:49.459 --> 12:50.526
Not so good at home.

12:51.794 --> 12:52.663
Oh shit.

12:54.597 --> 12:55.566
I'm sorry to hear that.

12:58.667 --> 12:59.769
You ever talk to Maggie?

13:03.506 --> 13:05.805
You got nothing
to worry about.

13:05.807 --> 13:06.776
What do you mean?

13:08.177 --> 13:11.714
Well, the girl's
crazy about you.

13:22.224 --> 13:23.759
She ever fuck anybody, Mac?

13:25.961 --> 13:27.794
What am I
gonna tell Jenny?

13:27.796 --> 13:30.765
Jesus Christ, be
a fucking man, Josh.

13:30.767 --> 13:32.732
It's $500.

13:32.734 --> 13:34.367
I don't make your kind of money.

13:34.369 --> 13:38.206
I don't know, just tell
her to fuck off or something.

13:38.208 --> 13:39.740
What kind of talk is that?

13:39.742 --> 13:41.842
Okay, I'm just
playing with you.

13:41.844 --> 13:43.711
You make your own money, right?

13:43.713 --> 13:44.815
Okay, I get it.

13:53.823 --> 13:55.722
Sounds like a bear.

13:55.724 --> 13:56.692
I don't think so.

13:57.826 --> 13:58.695
Holy shit.

14:04.901 --> 14:06.266
I wonder.

14:06.268 --> 14:07.503
Wonder what?

14:10.339 --> 14:12.608
Let's just get some rest.

15:29.786 --> 15:32.520
What are you
laughing at?

15:32.522 --> 15:34.521
Drop your cocks and
grab your socks, boys!

15:34.523 --> 15:35.591
We got hunting to do!

16:15.931 --> 16:19.500
The only hunting that I do
is when I play video games.

16:19.502 --> 16:20.370
Ha!

16:21.137 --> 16:22.370
Here.

16:22.372 --> 16:23.040
Oh.

16:25.507 --> 16:26.376
Mm.

16:27.709 --> 16:29.876
You ever think about
getting married?

16:29.878 --> 16:32.011
You ever think about
getting divorced?

16:32.013 --> 16:32.880
No.

16:32.882 --> 16:33.747
Honestly?

16:33.749 --> 16:34.615
No.

16:34.617 --> 16:35.915
Bullshit.

16:35.917 --> 16:37.820
No, my wife is hot.

16:39.388 --> 16:41.121
Okay, but why would I
get married when I can do

16:41.123 --> 16:42.892
what I want when
I want to do it?

16:44.960 --> 16:45.992
Makes sense.

16:45.994 --> 16:46.961
Yeah.

16:46.963 --> 16:48.832
So here's to Josh and
his happy marriage.

16:50.132 --> 16:51.999
Hot wife.

16:53.136 --> 16:55.770
Hot wife.

16:55.772 --> 16:56.703
Mm.

16:56.705 --> 16:58.005
Whoa.

16:58.007 --> 16:59.740
Oh, ha ha, whew!

16:59.742 --> 17:00.673
Let's walk that off.

17:00.675 --> 17:01.875
What's in there?

17:01.877 --> 17:03.512
Is that, uh, Rumpelman's?

17:13.890 --> 17:14.958
This place is dead.

17:17.026 --> 17:17.893
Not even a squirrel.

17:30.038 --> 17:31.907
How are you and Shelly doing?

17:32.941 --> 17:34.009
Good, good.

17:37.712 --> 17:40.448
Maggie and I, we
ain't doing so good.

17:40.450 --> 17:42.084
Really, what's going on?

17:45.054 --> 17:45.921
You didn't know?

17:49.792 --> 17:51.057
You see that?

17:51.059 --> 17:51.927
See what?

17:55.998 --> 17:56.866
I don't know.

17:59.835 --> 18:01.067
Looked like people, but.

18:01.069 --> 18:01.937
What?

18:04.673 --> 18:06.475
All this fresh
air's getting to me.

19:00.997 --> 19:02.295
What the fuck?

19:02.297 --> 19:04.834
Oh no no, no, no.

19:10.972 --> 19:12.041
Holy shit!

19:22.151 --> 19:25.218
Dudes, we got a fucking
psychopath out here!

19:25.220 --> 19:26.088
Guys!

19:29.758 --> 19:30.826
This is not good.

19:31.861 --> 19:33.994
Who would do this?

19:33.996 --> 19:35.228
What are you doing?

19:35.230 --> 19:36.729
I'm gonna butter bread.

19:36.731 --> 19:38.064
What the fuck does it
look like I'm gonna do.

19:38.066 --> 19:40.199
Man, you just can't go
around killing people.

19:40.201 --> 19:42.169
Does anyone live around here?

19:42.171 --> 19:45.104
Yeah, what if there's
like a community of weirdos.

19:45.106 --> 19:48.007
Like that movie with the
banjo and the bridge.

19:48.009 --> 19:50.343
Just relax, nobody's
gonna fuck you in the ass.

19:50.345 --> 19:52.845
Seriously though, how are
we gonna get out of here.

19:52.847 --> 19:55.149
How far back was
it to the highway?

19:55.151 --> 19:56.119
A bit.

19:58.086 --> 19:59.221
Come on, let's go.

20:09.632 --> 20:11.230
It's probably
just some punk kids.

20:11.232 --> 20:12.101
What kids?

20:13.335 --> 20:15.034
Wait, did you
bring your phone?

20:15.036 --> 20:15.902
No.

20:15.904 --> 20:16.603
Fuck!

20:16.605 --> 20:17.839
Well how far is the highway?

20:17.841 --> 20:20.174
What does that matter if we
don't have a fucking phone?

20:20.176 --> 20:22.876
Look, I'm gonna go back to
the cabin and go grab mine.

20:22.878 --> 20:24.210
Keep your eyes out.

20:24.212 --> 20:25.080
Yeah.

20:48.237 --> 20:49.139
Holy shit!

20:59.280 --> 21:01.116
Have a drink, relax.

21:03.219 --> 21:04.853
Nah, it's too early for that.

21:07.323 --> 21:09.092
How we gonna get out of here.

21:11.259 --> 21:13.127
Here's how its gonna go.

21:13.129 --> 21:15.829
Steve and Dave are gonna
walk to the highway.

21:15.831 --> 21:18.966
From the highway,
they'll call for help.

21:18.968 --> 21:21.267
From the highway, their
cell phones will work.

21:21.269 --> 21:23.203
That's right!

21:23.205 --> 21:26.873
They'll tell the police where
we are and the cavalry arrives

21:26.875 --> 21:28.708
to save the day.

21:28.710 --> 21:30.944
That's good, that's good!

21:30.946 --> 21:31.881
It is good.

21:34.016 --> 21:36.719
Alright, thank you.

21:39.421 --> 21:40.954
What are you
doing, where's Dave?

21:40.956 --> 21:41.825
Forgot my phone.

21:45.161 --> 21:46.161
I was gonna call you, but.

21:54.335 --> 21:55.704
Steve, wait up.

21:57.238 --> 21:58.107
Where's Dave.

22:03.045 --> 22:04.277
Got a problem.

22:04.279 --> 22:04.978
Did you find who did it?

22:04.980 --> 22:07.346
We got a problem on our hands.

22:07.348 --> 22:08.283
What do you mean?

22:18.227 --> 22:20.263
That is not a bear print.

22:21.162 --> 22:23.362
A big fucking guy or a.

22:23.364 --> 22:26.365
I know what this is.

22:26.367 --> 22:28.904
This is a fucking Sasquatch.

22:33.209 --> 22:35.210
I say we track
this fucker down.

22:37.246 --> 22:38.411
Now you're talking.

22:38.413 --> 22:40.380
It fucked up our jeep.

22:40.382 --> 22:42.049
No, no no no no no.

22:42.051 --> 22:44.016
You guys are crazy.

22:44.018 --> 22:47.323
Well boys, looks like
we've found our big hunt.

23:06.508 --> 23:08.242
Can't we just get out of here?

23:08.244 --> 23:11.410
First we bag the motherfucker,
then we'll get some help.

23:11.412 --> 23:13.380
I'll drink to that.

23:13.382 --> 23:15.515
Is that all you do is drink?

23:15.517 --> 23:17.319
Is that all you do is whine?

23:18.353 --> 23:20.055
Here's to bagging Bigfoot.

23:36.471 --> 23:37.339
Give me one!

23:39.440 --> 23:40.442
Sure.

24:36.966 --> 24:38.334
Did you hear that?

24:50.345 --> 24:52.347
What the fuck is that?

24:56.352 --> 24:57.253
It's a kid.

24:59.520 --> 25:01.354
You killed a kid.

25:01.356 --> 25:02.555
Self-defense.

25:02.557 --> 25:03.492
He's right, Josh.

25:07.263 --> 25:09.496
Shouldn't we call
the cops or something?

25:09.498 --> 25:13.432
Yeah, you should
call the cops.

25:13.434 --> 25:15.534
Why don't you use
your cell phone.

25:15.536 --> 25:17.403
While you're at it,
see if the can give us

25:17.405 --> 25:19.406
a ride back into town.

25:29.384 --> 25:30.286
So now what?

25:31.452 --> 25:32.321
It ain't over.

25:33.488 --> 25:34.390
What do you mean?

25:36.091 --> 25:38.190
We killed a kid, now
we gotta deal with Daddy.

25:38.192 --> 25:40.427
Alright, just sit down,
we'll drink some beers,

25:40.429 --> 25:43.365
play some cards, and we'll
deal with it in the morning.

25:44.533 --> 25:46.365
I'm not gonna just
sit down and drink beers

25:46.367 --> 25:47.400
and play cards right now.

25:47.402 --> 25:48.371
Are you serious?

25:51.407 --> 25:52.408
He's looking for his kid.

25:53.508 --> 25:54.544
Oh fuck.

25:56.478 --> 25:57.546
We gotta take him out.

26:07.722 --> 26:08.490
Where they going?

26:10.625 --> 26:12.993
Guess they're
going to get Daddy.

26:12.995 --> 26:14.998
Well what the fuck
are we supposed to do.

26:16.131 --> 26:17.563
I brought some porn.

26:17.565 --> 26:19.401
Oh my God, I don't feel well.

26:20.436 --> 26:21.968
You okay?

26:21.970 --> 26:22.638
No!

26:38.554 --> 26:43.559
Okay, okay.

27:04.546 --> 27:08.151
We are never getting
out of this alive, Mac.

27:09.117 --> 27:11.051
Jesus, we've got guns.

27:11.053 --> 27:14.521
We don't have guns,
they have got guns.

27:14.523 --> 27:17.224
How does your wife
put up with you?

27:17.226 --> 27:20.494
Look, we'll bag the beast.

27:20.496 --> 27:21.531
We'll all go home.

27:22.698 --> 27:24.230
And then we'll wind
up on the cover

27:24.232 --> 27:26.632
of fucking National
Geographic Magazine.

27:26.634 --> 27:27.502
How's that?

27:30.671 --> 27:35.374
First off, I don't even think
they publish that anymore,

27:35.376 --> 27:36.578
and second...

27:38.646 --> 27:40.082
Fuck you, Mac!

28:07.508 --> 28:09.112
You probably think
I'm an asshole.

28:22.591 --> 28:24.724
Oh you're an asshole.

29:00.863 --> 29:03.466
You know he's watching us.

29:18.713 --> 29:21.747
You fucking crazy,
what's the matter with you?

29:23.619 --> 29:25.088
What the fuck, Steve?

29:27.655 --> 29:29.357
What the fuck are
you doing, Steve?

29:31.759 --> 29:33.192
Stop this shit, Steve,
or I'll put a bullet

29:33.194 --> 29:34.629
right in your fucking head!

29:58.386 --> 30:01.787
Mac, Mac, Mac, wake
up, wake up, Mac!

30:01.789 --> 30:03.689
You motherfucker, wake up!

30:03.691 --> 30:06.595
Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God.

30:07.796 --> 30:10.830
Okay, okay, what if,
what are they even doing?

30:10.832 --> 30:12.364
What if it got them?

30:12.366 --> 30:14.633
That means he'd be
coming back here, Mac,

30:14.635 --> 30:15.735
you motherfucker

30:15.737 --> 30:17.803
He's coming back here, and
I don't have any weapons.

30:17.805 --> 30:18.871
I don't have any weapons.

30:18.873 --> 30:20.640
I don't have any weapons.

30:20.642 --> 30:24.744
We, we have a fire, we
have a fucking fire,

30:24.746 --> 30:26.780
firewood, ax, ax in the
shed, ax in the shed!

30:26.782 --> 30:31.721
You got this, you got this,
motherfucker, you got this!

30:50.439 --> 30:54.407
Okay, okay, you
can do this, Josh.

30:54.409 --> 30:57.513
You've fucking got
this, Josh, okay, okay.

30:58.713 --> 31:00.715
Mac, you drunk motherfucker.

31:02.284 --> 31:06.789
If you can hear me, you tell
my wife that I love her.

31:09.557 --> 31:10.425
Mm.

31:11.759 --> 31:14.294
Okay, Josh has got this.

31:14.296 --> 31:16.362
Josh has got this.

31:16.364 --> 31:17.730
Josh has got this shit.

31:17.732 --> 31:19.467
Okay, okay, okay.

31:20.635 --> 31:22.738
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.

32:13.488 --> 32:14.356
Thank God!

32:23.899 --> 32:24.767
Where's Dave?

32:25.801 --> 32:26.736
What's wrong, Steve?

32:33.075 --> 32:33.942
Where's Dave?

32:41.783 --> 32:43.819
That shit came out of nowhere.

32:47.555 --> 32:49.325
Big ugly motherfucker.

32:55.029 --> 32:58.033
Oh my God, we gotta
get out of here.

33:10.879 --> 33:13.912
Steve, we have to get the
fuck outta here right now.

33:13.914 --> 33:14.980
My cell phone is gone.

33:14.982 --> 33:15.681
What?

33:15.683 --> 33:18.150
My fucking cell phone is gone!

33:18.152 --> 33:20.120
What are we gonna do, Steve?

33:20.122 --> 33:21.588
We need a plan, we
gotta get out of here.

33:21.590 --> 33:22.988
We need to get up
to the highway and...

33:22.990 --> 33:25.024
Just calm the fuck down!

33:29.564 --> 33:30.432
We got a firearm.

33:31.400 --> 33:33.835
You got a pitchfork, ax.

33:35.003 --> 33:36.002
Hey hey, hey hey, my
phone's in the jeep.

33:36.004 --> 33:36.872
I'm gonna grab it.

33:40.142 --> 33:41.677
What's the point?

33:43.778 --> 33:45.780
Guys, get the fuck
out here right now.

33:55.055 --> 33:56.956
You guys, you guys,
the body's gone.

33:56.958 --> 33:58.091
It's gone.

33:58.093 --> 33:59.929
Christ, he's been here.

34:01.962 --> 34:04.032
We're gonna kill
him, right Steve?

34:07.035 --> 34:07.902
Yeah.

34:10.739 --> 34:12.438
Guys, my fucking
cell phone is gone.

34:12.440 --> 34:14.009
Okay, well what do we do now?

34:16.076 --> 34:18.178
We'll let him come to us.

34:47.975 --> 34:50.078
I think this is gonna work.

34:51.110 --> 34:53.014
What if it doesn't?

34:55.081 --> 34:56.684
Then we put you
outside as bait.

34:59.087 --> 35:00.422
You got a better idea?

35:10.866 --> 35:11.967
This is weird without Dave.

35:18.873 --> 35:22.645
Yeah, well if this
doesn't work, we join him.

36:05.152 --> 36:07.922
How are you and
your wife doing?

36:10.725 --> 36:11.393
What?

36:13.895 --> 36:15.864
You and Jenny, how you doing?

36:19.167 --> 36:20.703
We're fine, we're fine.

36:25.172 --> 36:28.141
How do you make it
work, you and Jenny.

36:28.143 --> 36:30.109
I don't, I don't
know, do we have to talk

36:30.111 --> 36:31.080
about this right now?

36:35.884 --> 36:38.087
My wife and I, Maggie and I.

36:46.194 --> 36:47.529
I didn't know.

36:50.631 --> 36:52.066
You didn't know?

36:53.234 --> 36:54.103
No.

36:59.607 --> 37:01.107
Maggie, she wants me
to go to counseling.

37:01.109 --> 37:03.712
You believe that
shit?

37:10.618 --> 37:13.886
Jenny and I, we talk a lot.

37:13.888 --> 37:16.955
I mean, I mean, you know
me, I never shut up,

37:16.957 --> 37:18.126
I just, I tell her everything.

37:21.129 --> 37:22.096
That seems to work.

37:24.399 --> 37:25.267
Yeah.

37:27.636 --> 37:29.038
I should do more of that.

38:00.035 --> 38:01.270
He wants us to come outside.

38:02.803 --> 38:04.305
No, no!

38:06.808 --> 38:09.044
Let's give him what he wants.

38:36.471 --> 38:38.207
That's his shirt.

38:40.207 --> 38:42.975
That's it, I can't do this.

38:42.977 --> 38:44.143
I can't do this,
we gotta go back,

38:44.145 --> 38:46.011
we gotta go back, I can't...

38:46.013 --> 38:48.149
You wanna get the
fuck out of here or not?

38:51.453 --> 38:56.659
Yes.

39:16.210 --> 39:19.112
He's losing his fucking mind.

39:19.114 --> 39:22.214
I have to get him
back to the cabin.

39:22.216 --> 39:23.151
Be careful.

39:42.437 --> 39:44.105
Where are you,
you motherfucker?

39:48.276 --> 39:52.277
These are my kills.

39:52.279 --> 39:53.748
My kills, you understand me?

39:55.517 --> 39:56.719
You bastard!

40:02.256 --> 40:06.091
Josh, I need you
to snap out of it.

40:06.093 --> 40:06.961
Here, drink this.

40:07.895 --> 40:08.763
Josh.

40:11.399 --> 40:12.431
Josh!

40:12.433 --> 40:13.302
Snap out of it!

40:21.375 --> 40:22.276
Help me get him to bed.

40:56.844 --> 40:58.344
I'm sorry that
I have feelings,

40:58.346 --> 41:00.413
and that you're just this
fucking angel, I'm sorry.

41:00.415 --> 41:03.415
I don't want to
hear it anymore.

41:03.417 --> 41:04.417
I'm sorry that I failed...

41:04.419 --> 41:06.221
I don't want to hear anymore!

41:07.355 --> 41:08.487
Do you understand me?

41:08.489 --> 41:12.357
I don't want to fucking
hear it anymore.

41:12.359 --> 41:15.329
All your little fucking excuses,
you little fucking cunt!

41:17.966 --> 41:19.297
Why?

41:19.299 --> 41:20.301
Hands off me,
get your hands off!

41:27.375 --> 41:31.643
Oh, this is my kind of party,
Mac, drinking and fucking,

41:31.645 --> 41:36.449
drinking and fucking,
whew!

41:36.451 --> 41:41.456
Mmm, yahoo!

42:05.379 --> 42:07.348
What is it, what the fuck?

42:15.522 --> 42:17.425
Come on, you bastard!

42:24.498 --> 42:26.535
He's lost his fucking mind.

42:29.536 --> 42:34.343
I'll go get him.

42:42.482 --> 42:43.451
Where are you?

42:44.551 --> 42:45.553
Where are you?

42:46.587 --> 42:49.120
You fucker!

42:49.122 --> 42:50.291
Where are you?

43:03.103 --> 43:04.437
Where are you?

43:19.453 --> 43:20.455
Oh!

43:27.261 --> 43:31.333
What happened?

43:32.767 --> 43:34.169
You don't look so good.

43:38.473 --> 43:40.442
I am your friend.

43:43.578 --> 43:45.147
You are my friend.

43:48.649 --> 43:50.352
I am your friend.

43:53.353 --> 43:55.056
You didn't tell me.

43:59.493 --> 44:01.430
I wanted to tell you.

44:03.464 --> 44:04.596
You didn't tell me!

44:04.598 --> 44:06.531
I wanted to tell you.

44:06.533 --> 44:08.533
I did, I wanted to tell you.

44:08.535 --> 44:11.539
I'm sorry, I didn't
know what to do.

44:14.542 --> 44:17.179
It was eating me up, I
didn't know what to do.

44:17.812 --> 44:18.680
Get up.

44:20.681 --> 44:23.248
I'm sorry, Steve.

44:23.250 --> 44:24.118
Get up!

44:26.421 --> 44:29.457
You're gonna kill
me, aren't you.

44:31.658 --> 44:36.664
I'm sorry, Steve,
I don't want.

44:43.738 --> 44:44.605
Run!

44:47.642 --> 44:49.544
Fuck you, just do it!

44:50.578 --> 44:52.210
Fuck you, Steve!

44:52.212 --> 44:55.246
Run!

45:28.748 --> 45:32.154
What the fuck is
going on out there?

46:23.803 --> 46:25.773
What the fuck happened?

46:49.297 --> 46:51.864
I couldn't do anything.

46:51.866 --> 46:55.137
First
Dave, then Josh.

46:57.305 --> 47:00.741
Mac, I tried everything.

47:04.245 --> 47:06.815
I found this
outside, it's mine.

47:07.681 --> 47:09.484
It was fucking here, Steve.

47:11.785 --> 47:12.753
Here, drink this.

47:14.488 --> 47:15.656
We gotta get that arrow out.

47:18.225 --> 47:19.857
Bite down on this.

47:21.962 --> 47:23.330
This is gonna hurt.

47:41.881 --> 47:42.750
Alright.

47:55.863 --> 47:56.730
Alright.

47:57.732 --> 47:58.830
Alright.

47:58.832 --> 48:00.531
Alright.

48:00.533 --> 48:01.402
Alright.

48:07.875 --> 48:09.878
I am not fucking
dying out here, Steve.

48:11.645 --> 48:13.681
I am not fucking dying out here.

48:15.783 --> 48:16.685
Yes, you are.

48:35.935 --> 48:37.338
Can I come in?

48:54.855 --> 48:55.890
I really am sorry.

48:59.826 --> 49:02.828
I made an appointment
for us for a counselor,

49:02.830 --> 49:06.468
and we can go see her
when you get back.

49:09.937 --> 49:11.306
You are coming back?

50:40.027 --> 50:42.697
You had that this whole time.

50:49.069 --> 50:50.939
You fucked my wife.

50:56.109 --> 51:00.047
Big Mac, you always got
the chick, didn't you.

51:02.049 --> 51:04.085
I never said anything, I
was like, good for Mac.

51:09.022 --> 51:10.959
Until I met Maggie.

51:13.027 --> 51:16.564
But you couldn't let
just have one, could you?

51:19.065 --> 51:20.067
Just one.

51:23.069 --> 51:24.972
You've been a
shitty husband, Steve.

51:27.475 --> 51:30.975
What the fuck do you
know about being a husband?

51:32.980 --> 51:34.582
It's a good thing you
never got married,

51:36.082 --> 51:37.851
'cause you'd probably
fuck them over, too, huh?

51:41.955 --> 51:43.892
I've been a good friend.

51:46.960 --> 51:49.062
She came to me as a friend.

51:50.964 --> 51:53.934
'Cause you, you
were never around.

51:56.169 --> 52:00.541
If it wasn't me, it
would've been someone else.

52:04.111 --> 52:07.114
You, a friend?

52:10.017 --> 52:12.083
That's what friends do,
they fuck each other now?

52:12.085 --> 52:12.953
Is that it?

52:18.526 --> 52:21.094
I guess so 'cause that's
exactly what you did.

52:24.031 --> 52:28.002
My wife, you fucked Maggie.

52:29.069 --> 52:29.938
You fucked me.

52:32.906 --> 52:34.808
Now I'm gonna fuck you.

52:36.176 --> 52:37.045
You're right.

52:38.011 --> 52:39.046
Steve, you're fucking right.

52:41.281 --> 52:42.149
I'm the asshole.

52:44.018 --> 52:45.220
I'm the fucking asshole.

52:47.053 --> 52:48.856
But this, all of this.

52:57.730 --> 52:58.999
You are my friend.

53:01.701 --> 53:03.004
My best friend.

53:04.103 --> 53:05.006
My best man!

53:09.910 --> 53:11.513
I can't take back what I did.

53:14.181 --> 53:18.119
I can't undo what I did.

53:20.219 --> 53:24.221
And for that, I'm sorry.

53:24.223 --> 53:25.792
For that, I'm sorry.

53:40.140 --> 53:41.174
Me too, man.

53:46.113 --> 53:47.181
Me too.

55:31.984 --> 55:34.319
What was I supposed to do?

55:34.321 --> 55:38.323
What was I supposed
to do, Steve, huh?

55:38.325 --> 55:39.991
What did you want me to do?

55:39.993 --> 55:41.826
What did you want me to say?

55:41.828 --> 55:46.834
Hey Steve, what do
you think about them Seahawks?

55:48.368 --> 55:50.368
You think they're gonna
overcome those challenges

55:50.370 --> 55:53.237
with the offensive
line?

55:53.239 --> 55:58.346
Oh, by the way, Mac's been
fucking your wife?

56:04.917 --> 56:09.790
I have a fucking
spear in my chest.

56:20.234 --> 56:21.235
Oh!

56:56.402 --> 56:57.772
Sweaters, right?

56:59.071 --> 57:01.406
How cold do you
think it's gonna be?

57:01.408 --> 57:04.275
I don't know, Josh,
where you going?

57:04.277 --> 57:06.944
I don't know.

57:06.946 --> 57:09.413
Steve said something
about a cabin,

57:09.415 --> 57:14.087
but he also said to bring
cash, so I'm hoping it's Reno.

57:16.924 --> 57:18.793
How many sweaters
do you think I need?

57:19.493 --> 57:22.294
Reno?

57:22.296 --> 57:25.263
Umm, you really think you
should be going to Reno?

57:25.265 --> 57:26.964
I mean it's not
like we have money

57:26.966 --> 57:28.235
to be throwing around, huh?

57:29.937 --> 57:34.408
I know, I know,
but we go every year.

57:35.475 --> 57:37.310
You know, it's not
like I can just say no.

57:45.986 --> 57:46.988
That's nice.

57:51.457 --> 57:53.426
I wanted to go to Reno!

58:31.531 --> 58:34.936
Oh my God, oh my
God, oh my God, help!

58:38.906 --> 58:42.476
Help, help, help!

58:44.243 --> 58:45.446
Open the door!

58:46.480 --> 58:47.415
Hello, please!

58:49.515 --> 58:50.383
I need help.

58:51.484 --> 58:56.054
My friend, he tried to
kill me, and then there was

58:56.056 --> 59:00.461
this Sasquatch
spear-throwing monster thing.

59:03.596 --> 59:08.602
There was a very unfortunate
hunting accident.

59:12.406 --> 59:15.406
I need help, open the door.

59:15.408 --> 59:20.413
I just need a
fucking break.

59:32.091 --> 59:32.959
Hello?

59:53.413 --> 59:54.282
Hello?

01:00:56.609 --> 01:00:57.544
Fuck!

01:01:07.654 --> 01:01:11.522
I'm in his fucking house.

01:01:11.524 --> 01:01:14.327
You gotta be fucking kidding me.

01:01:20.332 --> 01:01:25.338
Oh.

01:04:56.649 --> 01:04:58.882
Come on, you fucker!

01:05:14.801 --> 01:05:15.669
Ah, no!

01:08:36.001 --> 01:08:37.133
Stop!

01:08:37.135 --> 01:08:38.004
Stop!

01:08:38.938 --> 01:08:39.973
Stop, stop, stop!

01:08:42.006 --> 01:08:44.140
Stop, stop!

01:08:44.143 --> 01:08:45.011
Stop!

01:08:48.081 --> 01:08:53.086
Oh, oh!

01:08:53.952 --> 01:08:54.888
Thank you, thank you!

01:08:56.555 --> 01:08:57.223
Thank you!

01:09:04.630 --> 01:09:06.966
I didn't think you
were gonna stop.

01:09:08.001 --> 01:09:09.470
Thank you for stopping.

01:09:13.572 --> 01:09:15.142
Oh, fuck me!

01:12:51.224 --> 01:12:52.959
Action!

01:12:56.929 --> 01:12:59.933
Honey, we didn't go to Reno.

01:13:04.940 --> 01:13:06.180
