00:13.314 --> 00:16.550
Lee:
I've been kinda
pissed off lately.

00:16.584 --> 00:18.386
And it's not just me.

00:18.419 --> 00:21.355
Everyone I know has been
pissed off lately--

00:21.389 --> 00:23.691
Bella, Monica, Allison.

00:23.724 --> 00:25.493
None of us knows why.

00:25.526 --> 00:27.695
It's not rage or fury.

00:27.728 --> 00:30.464
It's not malaise or ennui.

00:30.498 --> 00:33.267
I mean, hell, I wish
it was something specific,

00:33.301 --> 00:35.836
something I could just
point my finger at and say,

00:35.869 --> 00:39.240
"Doctor, look.
Here's where it hurts.

00:39.273 --> 00:41.242
Here is where
I'm bleeding."

00:41.275 --> 00:42.576
But it isn't.

00:42.610 --> 00:46.614
I mean, the only way that
I can describe it is this.

00:46.647 --> 00:49.183
I feel like an Israelite.

00:49.217 --> 00:50.718
You know,
I remember as a kid

00:50.751 --> 00:53.321
that story of the Israelites
in the desert

00:53.354 --> 00:55.589
and how they wandered
around for 40 years,

00:55.623 --> 00:59.560
being told about
this awesome place,
this promised land.

00:59.593 --> 01:01.729
And you know what they found
when they got there?

01:01.762 --> 01:03.664
A fucking desert.

01:03.697 --> 01:05.733
Oh, Bella,
this was a bad idea.

01:05.766 --> 01:07.568
Oh, come on.
It's worth a shot.

01:07.601 --> 01:10.104
- There's over
400 stores in here.
- ( Lee groans )

01:10.138 --> 01:12.640
Something in here
has to lift our spirits.

01:12.673 --> 01:15.509
- Retail therapy.
- Ugh. Retail therapy.

01:15.543 --> 01:17.745
You know who
retail therapy helps?

01:17.778 --> 01:20.681
- Retailers.
- I'm trying to help, Lee.

01:20.714 --> 01:22.316
You wanna spend
a hundred bucks

01:22.350 --> 01:24.718
bitching about your mother
to some shrink,

01:24.752 --> 01:28.356
or do you wanna
spend a hundred bucks
on some foxy cutoffs?

01:28.389 --> 01:30.691
No, no, no, no.

01:30.724 --> 01:33.361
Bella. Ugh.

01:34.628 --> 01:36.597
- ( whistles )
- Fuck.

01:36.630 --> 01:39.900
* If you're happy
and you know it,
clap your hands *

01:39.933 --> 01:42.603
* If you're happy and you
know it, clap your hands *

01:42.636 --> 01:45.439
* If you're
happy and you know it,
then motherfucking show it *

01:45.473 --> 01:48.276
* If you're happy
and you know it, clap your
motherfucking hands *

01:48.309 --> 01:51.745
* If you're happy
and you know it,
clap your hands! *

01:53.947 --> 01:55.283
- ( music playing )
- * Girl...

01:55.316 --> 01:57.618
Yes, yeah,
that-- that's hot.

01:57.651 --> 01:59.687
Very nice.
Very nice indeed.

01:59.720 --> 02:01.189
All right.
Can you go the other way?

02:01.222 --> 02:03.391
Very nice.
( laughs )

02:03.424 --> 02:06.260
Atomic Goldfarb.

02:06.294 --> 02:08.662
Is that a traditional
Jewish name, you think?

02:08.696 --> 02:09.730
Atomic?

02:09.763 --> 02:11.865
They say he's good.

02:11.899 --> 02:15.803
Please,
he's been brought in
to push me out.

02:15.836 --> 02:17.871
Probably, yes.

02:17.905 --> 02:21.609
( sighs )
I don't know why I'm doing
the Wonderbra thing, anyway.

02:21.642 --> 02:22.910
I'm buried
in my own accounts.

02:22.943 --> 02:25.746
Fuck you, Thom.
You should be thanking me.

02:25.779 --> 02:27.381
This is the only
account of Larry's

02:27.415 --> 02:30.318
that everyone's
been begging me for.

02:30.351 --> 02:33.387
( man laughs )
That's it. That's it.

02:33.421 --> 02:35.523
Look at that.

02:35.556 --> 02:38.459
I gotta tell ya,
this does nothing
for me anymore.

02:38.492 --> 02:43.264
Having sex with Dani
is just like a whole
different thing.

02:43.297 --> 02:45.833
Her body is like--

02:45.866 --> 02:48.202
it's like a map
of her life.

02:48.236 --> 02:48.902
Oh, God.

02:48.936 --> 02:50.538
I mean,
at first I'm like,

02:50.571 --> 02:54.442
"Hey, this is the oldest woman
I've ever had sex with,"

02:54.475 --> 02:56.877
but now I think she may be
the only real woman

02:56.910 --> 02:57.978
I've ever had sex with.

02:58.011 --> 03:00.581
Every female body
under 40

03:00.614 --> 03:02.650
looks like they bought it
from the same catalog,

03:02.683 --> 03:04.252
which they did.

03:04.285 --> 03:07.288
And women under 30
are like Ikea furniture.

03:07.321 --> 03:09.690
You know, it looks good,
but everyone's got it.

03:09.723 --> 03:12.793
By the time you get it home,
it's probably gonna be damaged.

03:12.826 --> 03:17.798
But I'm telling you,
when I cup Dani's breast
in my hand,

03:17.831 --> 03:23.737
there's-- there's life
in there, you know?

03:23.771 --> 03:25.239
You can't buy that.

03:25.273 --> 03:27.541
There's no surgery
you get for that.

03:27.575 --> 03:28.942
It's life.
It's a journey.

03:28.976 --> 03:31.779
And every dent, every scar,
every imperfection

03:31.812 --> 03:34.348
just makes a woman
all the more beautiful.

03:34.382 --> 03:38.352
Gravity does wonderful things
to the female body.

03:38.386 --> 03:39.520
Yep.

03:41.422 --> 03:43.391
Have you ever sucked
a saggy tit?

03:43.424 --> 03:44.592
Whoa.

03:49.830 --> 03:53.267
Can she take
that gum out?

04:07.481 --> 04:09.317
We have arrived!

04:10.618 --> 04:12.720
Wait.

04:12.753 --> 04:14.688
This is it?

04:14.722 --> 04:17.891
This is the promised land?

04:17.925 --> 04:20.661
Are you kidding me?
It's a shithole.

04:20.694 --> 04:23.397
Yes, but it's
our shithole.

04:23.431 --> 04:24.432
A shithole?

04:24.465 --> 04:26.367
It's not even
a fucking shithole.

04:26.400 --> 04:28.536
It's nothing.
A shithole would
be something.

04:28.569 --> 04:30.804
Nothing is
ever good enough
for you people.

04:30.838 --> 04:33.441
- No wonder God hates you.
- Barry: This is bullshit.

04:33.474 --> 04:35.476
I knew we shouldn't
have left Egypt.

04:35.509 --> 04:37.378
At least back in Egypt
we could have imagined
someplace better.

04:37.411 --> 04:38.946
Oh, fuck it.
Let's just go back.

04:38.979 --> 04:42.583
Oh, can't we please
just try to enjoy this?

04:42.616 --> 04:45.085
Lee:
He said that we would
find something here.

04:45.118 --> 04:47.087
He said there would
be something here.

04:47.120 --> 04:50.591
A reason, a purpose,
a meaning.

04:50.624 --> 04:51.992
He lied to us, Bells.

04:52.025 --> 04:53.794
Enjoy what?

04:53.827 --> 04:57.865
The scorpions,
the emptiness,
the sand?

04:57.898 --> 04:59.733
Yes! Sand.

04:59.767 --> 05:01.502
Sand is fun, okay?

05:01.535 --> 05:02.870
What do you got
against sand?

05:02.903 --> 05:04.738
Sand castles.
Sand boxes.

05:04.772 --> 05:06.840
- Sand crabs.
- Sand storms.

05:06.874 --> 05:09.009
Oh, can't we just play
in the sand, guys?

05:09.042 --> 05:11.445
Can't we just play
in the sand?

05:11.479 --> 05:16.584
'Cause I'm so sick
of wandering and walking
and waiting.

05:16.617 --> 05:20.954
And if we play in the sand,
it'll cheer us up, okay?

05:20.988 --> 05:22.390
Let's just play
in the sand.

05:22.423 --> 05:25.726
Look at me.
I'm just playing in the sand!

05:25.759 --> 05:28.696
- ( screaming )
- My eyes!

05:28.729 --> 05:30.798
Oh, my God.
My eyes.

05:30.831 --> 05:32.466
Bella, I think I'm gonna
have a seizure.

05:32.500 --> 05:33.834
Can we please
get out of here?

05:33.867 --> 05:34.935
Look at the picture
on this.

05:34.968 --> 05:36.103
It's amazing.

05:36.136 --> 05:38.071
Helen Keller
had the right idea.

05:38.105 --> 05:39.907
Blind and deaf.
That's the way to go.

05:39.940 --> 05:42.876
64-inch screen.
2,000 pixels.

05:42.910 --> 05:45.879
Did you ever hear
that Lenny Bruce thing
about fake vomit?

05:45.913 --> 05:47.481
No, and we don't want to.

05:47.515 --> 05:49.883
Mm. He said, "You know why
they make fake vomit?

05:49.917 --> 05:52.386
'Cause the fake shit
sold so well."

05:53.454 --> 05:55.589
$3,000, huh?
You sell a lot of these?

05:55.623 --> 05:57.558
Oh, can't keep them
in the store.

05:57.591 --> 05:59.760
I think I have
one more in stock
if you're interested.

05:59.793 --> 06:02.095
- Do you have any crack?
- Crack?

06:02.129 --> 06:05.466
Yeah. I'm looking
for something that's maybe
a little less addictive,

06:05.499 --> 06:07.067
maybe something
a little less bad
for my brain?

06:07.100 --> 06:08.736
Can you just
chill the fuck out?

06:08.769 --> 06:11.505
- I'll come back.
- All right, Rich.
Thank you.

06:11.539 --> 06:12.473
Bella...

06:13.707 --> 06:15.175
I'm just trying
to have a nice time.

06:15.208 --> 06:17.445
I just wanna have
a mindless day.

06:17.478 --> 06:20.881
One day without
the kid and the school
and the husband, okay?

06:20.914 --> 06:24.151
Go through the mall,
buy a few things,
get a manicure.

06:24.184 --> 06:26.053
Do you have to fuckin' piss
on everything?

06:26.086 --> 06:28.489
Whoa, wait.
I'm not pissing
on anything, Bella.

06:28.522 --> 06:30.190
I'm allowed
to have an opinion.

06:30.223 --> 06:33.060
And I'm allowed
not to have to hear it,
Lee, okay?

06:33.093 --> 06:35.529
Just today.
Just for once.

06:35.563 --> 06:38.966
Just humor me, all right?
I know it's stupid.

06:38.999 --> 06:41.502
That's the whole point,
you know?

06:41.535 --> 06:43.136
The whole thing
is fuckin' stupid.

06:43.170 --> 06:47.941
But sometimes I just
need stupid, okay?

06:47.975 --> 06:49.677
Don't yuck my yum.

06:49.710 --> 06:52.680
That's what they say
at Clarence's school.

06:52.713 --> 06:54.682
Don't yuck my yum.

06:54.715 --> 06:57.084
Okay, you're right.
I'm sorry.

06:57.117 --> 06:59.587
Okay? I won't fuck
with your bubble

06:59.620 --> 07:01.221
and you don't
yuck my yum.

07:01.254 --> 07:04.858
Okay, I won't
yuck your yum.

07:04.892 --> 07:07.995
- Thank you.
My yum appreciates it.
- Okay, good.

07:08.028 --> 07:10.564
Okay, speaking of yum,
let's get a fuckin' drink.

07:10.598 --> 07:12.032
Oh!

07:12.065 --> 07:13.634
Not a bad gig, huh?

07:13.667 --> 07:15.102
- ( music playing )
- Thom: Not a bad gig.

07:17.237 --> 07:18.872
You live in Woodstock?

07:18.906 --> 07:20.240
Yeah.

07:20.273 --> 07:22.476
That's where
that concert was, right?

07:22.510 --> 07:24.244
- That's right.
- When was that?

07:24.277 --> 07:27.481
Like, late '90s
or something, right?

07:27.515 --> 07:30.017
Uh, there was a second one
in the late '90s.

07:30.050 --> 07:32.119
The first was late '60s.

07:32.152 --> 07:36.123
Oh, two concerts.
Cool, cool.

07:38.291 --> 07:41.228
So you're doing,
like, a retro hippy
sort of thing, huh?

07:41.261 --> 07:43.497
Sort of like
a post-city, indie,

07:43.531 --> 07:46.567
nonmaterialistic,
anti-social media vibe?

07:46.600 --> 07:48.736
Cool, cool.
I dig that.

07:48.769 --> 07:50.137
You know, a buddy of mine
in Brooklyn's doing

07:50.170 --> 07:52.105
this whole
urban farm thing, man.

07:52.139 --> 07:53.140
Props to that.
Props to that.

07:53.173 --> 07:54.875
Just stop.
One s-- wait there.

07:54.908 --> 07:57.177
Yeah, cool, cool.
Do your thing, man.
Do your thing.

07:57.210 --> 07:59.880
I'll just be sitting here
watching some hotties.

07:59.913 --> 08:02.282
Jonathan says
he wants you to be
at the JP Morgan briefing.

08:02.315 --> 08:04.618
Well, tell him I'd love to,
but I can't

08:04.652 --> 08:06.286
because I'm babysitting
a fucking two-year-old

08:06.319 --> 08:08.155
and I have to run out
to buy some diapers.

08:08.188 --> 08:10.223
Uh, Jonathan,
Thom says he'd love to,

08:10.257 --> 08:12.626
but he and Atomic
are buried in Wonderbra.

08:12.660 --> 08:15.262
Lorna, tell Thom to stop
bullshitting a bullshitter.

08:15.295 --> 08:17.197
How long does it take
to pick a pair of tits?

08:17.230 --> 08:20.000
Jonathan's feeling
is that JP Morgan is
a priority right now.

08:20.033 --> 08:23.136
Well, tell him that
he shouldn't have put me
in a room with a fucking moron

08:23.170 --> 08:24.538
and given me
the unenviable task

08:24.572 --> 08:29.710
of having to choose
a pair of tits for the most
asinine product ever.

08:29.743 --> 08:30.911
Jonathan?

08:30.944 --> 08:32.880
Thom says he'll try.
Mm-hmm.

08:32.913 --> 08:34.181
- ( laughter )
- ( music playing )

08:34.214 --> 08:36.149
I told you
this was a good idea.

08:36.183 --> 08:37.585
No, this was
a good idea.

08:37.618 --> 08:39.653
Ugh, I just needed
a break, you know?

08:39.687 --> 08:42.656
Barry's just-- ugh.
I don't know.

08:42.690 --> 08:44.658
He's just so down
all the time, you know?

08:44.692 --> 08:46.159
Like, nothing
picks him up.

08:46.193 --> 08:47.728
He's yucking your yum.

08:47.761 --> 08:50.798
( both laughing )

08:50.831 --> 08:52.666
He says it's the job.

08:52.700 --> 08:54.902
I don't know, maybe it is.
I don't know.

08:54.935 --> 08:57.605
- Barry: Atomic?
- Thom: Atomic Goldfarb.

08:57.638 --> 08:59.840
The latest
underaged prophet

08:59.873 --> 09:03.811
sent to deliver
the lost 40-somethings
from the wilderness.

09:03.844 --> 09:05.646
Hey, at least you're
working on some titties.

09:05.679 --> 09:07.347
If I was working
on some titties,

09:07.380 --> 09:09.917
then maybe I wouldn't
be chasing every pair
that walked by.

09:09.950 --> 09:12.620
Hey, Bella is awesome.
Don't fuck it up.

09:12.653 --> 09:13.921
I know. I know.
She's great.

09:13.954 --> 09:15.222
It's just-- I don't know.

09:15.255 --> 09:16.824
You know, I mean,
you wouldn't want to read

09:16.857 --> 09:19.026
just one book
your whole life,
would you?

09:19.059 --> 09:21.194
What one book is enough
for a lifetime?

09:21.228 --> 09:23.997
- The Bible,
according to my mother.
- That's five books.

09:24.031 --> 09:25.633
32 if you count
the New Testament.

09:25.666 --> 09:26.967
That's a fucking lot
of books.

09:27.000 --> 09:29.336
Yeah, and none of them
are very good,
to be honest.

09:29.369 --> 09:31.371
Man, you know what?
I envy you.

09:31.404 --> 09:34.775
You think-- you think
Lee and I don't have issues?

09:34.808 --> 09:36.376
No, I didn't say
I envied your marriage.

09:36.409 --> 09:39.379
I envy your dream.
You still have a dream.

09:39.412 --> 09:42.883
See, you still believe
that if you just
had enough time

09:42.916 --> 09:44.184
to write a book or two,

09:44.217 --> 09:46.153
if you could just
become a writer,

09:46.186 --> 09:47.387
your life would be better.

09:47.420 --> 09:49.256
Me, I know
that's bullshit.

09:49.289 --> 09:51.625
I left
my corporate law gig,

09:51.659 --> 09:53.727
followed my heart,
moved to the country,

09:53.761 --> 09:55.929
became a family court
attorney.

09:55.963 --> 09:57.330
Something for my soul.

09:57.364 --> 09:58.732
And you know what?

09:58.766 --> 10:00.901
The work is shittier
than before.

10:00.934 --> 10:02.903
I've been
to the mountain top,
brother,

10:02.936 --> 10:05.873
and it's the same
miserable shit as
the mountain bottom.

10:05.906 --> 10:09.409
Barry was my beautiful
black knight in shining armor,

10:09.442 --> 10:11.244
you know,
leading me to freedom.

10:11.278 --> 10:14.047
- ( laughs )
- Just-- I don't know.

10:14.081 --> 10:15.783
We're not connecting lately.

10:15.816 --> 10:18.118
Same bed,
separate lives.

10:18.151 --> 10:19.853
I mean,
that's just reality, Bella.

10:19.887 --> 10:21.889
Honey, that's just--
that's just life.

10:21.922 --> 10:25.893
I mean, Thom and I don't
fuck like we used to,
but we laugh more.

10:25.926 --> 10:28.161
Yeah?

10:28.195 --> 10:31.198
Well, we don't
fuck or laugh.

10:32.833 --> 10:34.735
Maybe you should
talk to someone.

10:34.768 --> 10:36.770
- Maybe you should-- yeah.
- "Maybe." I'm talking to you.

10:36.804 --> 10:39.873
Yeah, I know.
You know, I mean,
someone you pay money to.

10:39.907 --> 10:42.409
No, or maybe depression
is not a disorder.

10:42.442 --> 10:43.911
Maybe life is the disorder.

10:43.944 --> 10:47.781
Maybe we're a smart virus
that has to adapt--

10:47.815 --> 10:49.349
God damn.
( laughs )

10:49.382 --> 10:51.785
Lost my train
of thought.

10:51.819 --> 10:53.153
Wow, there's
no conversation

10:53.186 --> 10:55.055
that won't stop
for, uh-- for ass.

10:55.088 --> 10:57.190
None.

10:57.224 --> 11:02.162
"Four score
and seven years ago,
a new-- holy crap!

11:02.195 --> 11:05.198
Look at the ass
on that bitch."

11:05.232 --> 11:10.203
"I have a dream
that one day this nation
will rise up and-- God damn.

11:10.237 --> 11:12.072
Look at the titties
in the front row.

11:12.105 --> 11:13.874
You're distracting
the King."

11:13.907 --> 11:15.208
Excuse me.

11:15.242 --> 11:16.476
Could we get
another round
of appletinis

11:16.509 --> 11:18.311
and some more
mozzarella sticks?

11:18.345 --> 11:20.047
- Sure.
- Oh, my God.

11:20.080 --> 11:22.916
( both laughing )

11:22.950 --> 11:25.485
I told you.
This was a good idea.

11:25.518 --> 11:30.290
Oh. No, mama,
this was a great idea.

11:30.323 --> 11:33.226
Larry:
My last day after 15 years.

11:33.260 --> 11:35.095
You know
what I'm proudest of?

11:35.128 --> 11:36.830
Wonderbra.
Supporting greatness.

11:36.864 --> 11:39.332
Hey, I inherited
that campaign.

11:39.366 --> 11:41.001
It's yours now, asshole.

11:41.034 --> 11:42.369
Yeah, don't remind me.

11:42.402 --> 11:45.338
Do you wanna
pick one last pair
before you leave?

11:45.372 --> 11:47.374
"We are going
to take this brand

11:47.407 --> 11:50.310
from hooters to heroines."

11:50.343 --> 11:52.279
( both laughing )

11:52.312 --> 11:54.347
Maya actually said that.

11:54.381 --> 11:56.483
And then she took us
through her slideshow

11:56.516 --> 11:58.819
of great women
with great racks.

11:58.852 --> 12:00.754
- I know.
- Eleanor Roosevelt.

12:00.788 --> 12:03.456
Golda Meir.
Barbara Bush.

12:03.490 --> 12:05.258
Hey, Babs had a rack
on her, man.

12:05.292 --> 12:07.294
Well, Bush '41
was a tit man.

12:07.327 --> 12:08.862
Yeah, well,
all presidents are tit men.

12:08.896 --> 12:12.032
Mm. Not Obama.
Obama's an ass man.

12:12.065 --> 12:13.834
( laughs )

12:13.867 --> 12:16.937
Yeah. Yeah, there's probably
a joke about the Oval Office,

12:16.970 --> 12:18.772
but I can't be bothered.

12:19.873 --> 12:21.909
Do you remember
when we first met?

12:21.942 --> 12:23.443
It's gotta be
15 years ago now.

12:23.476 --> 12:25.378
I came in here
and I said, "Hey...

12:25.412 --> 12:28.015
Larry Nash, love your work.
I just started here."

12:28.048 --> 12:30.117
- You know
what you said?
- What?

12:30.150 --> 12:32.219
"I'm sorry to hear that."

12:32.252 --> 12:34.121
( chuckles )

12:34.154 --> 12:35.422
Yeah.

12:35.455 --> 12:37.791
So what are you
most proud of?

12:40.060 --> 12:43.230
That in 15 years
in this fucking business

12:43.263 --> 12:46.333
I never once
stopped hating it.

12:50.337 --> 12:51.905
Good for you.

12:51.939 --> 12:53.974
I think that's what
bothers me the most

12:54.007 --> 12:56.176
about these
younger guys,
you know?

12:56.209 --> 12:57.477
That they think
it's cool.

12:57.510 --> 12:58.879
You know?
They like it.

12:58.912 --> 13:00.914
They don't mind
working for Satan.

13:00.948 --> 13:02.916
You know,
the pay is fantastic.

13:02.950 --> 13:05.318
But you can't forget
it's Satan.

13:05.352 --> 13:07.020
Did you call Dani?

13:07.054 --> 13:10.023
You know, I'm ashamed
I was ever good at it,
to be honest.

13:10.057 --> 13:12.926
You know, I think
it was the stuff that
made me happy back then.

13:12.960 --> 13:15.528
You know,
the brands and the things
when I was younger.

13:15.562 --> 13:18.198
The Nikes and the Levis
and the BMWs.

13:18.231 --> 13:19.466
It was fun
to be a part of.

13:19.499 --> 13:21.068
It was fun to get
involved with.

13:21.101 --> 13:22.936
Because the products
themselves

13:22.970 --> 13:25.472
actually made me
happy, you know?

13:25.505 --> 13:29.209
And then somewhere
around 35 or something,
something happens.

13:29.242 --> 13:30.510
It stopped making you happy.

13:30.543 --> 13:33.413
I remember looking around
my house a few months back,

13:33.446 --> 13:37.484
and it's just filled
with $5,000 couches

13:37.517 --> 13:40.287
and dead, soulless art,
and I just thought,

13:40.320 --> 13:43.223
"What the fuck
is all this shit?"

13:43.256 --> 13:44.491
My neighbor Ted was over,

13:44.524 --> 13:46.593
and I said, "Ted,
what is all this shit?"

13:46.626 --> 13:48.862
( chuckles )
What did he say?

13:48.896 --> 13:50.964
He offered me two grand
for the couch.

13:50.998 --> 13:52.599
( laughs )

13:53.600 --> 13:56.036
Did you call Dani?

13:56.069 --> 13:58.105
- Yeah.
- And?

13:58.138 --> 14:01.541
She said the average
employee age at Facebook is 26

14:01.574 --> 14:05.879
and at Google it's 31
and at Apple it's 33.

14:07.280 --> 14:11.451
I don't know what's worse,
your leaving or my staying.

14:17.257 --> 14:19.159
- ( music playing )
- Bella: This is sexy.

14:19.192 --> 14:21.428
What do you think?

14:21.461 --> 14:23.563
It would look good
on your daughter.

14:23.596 --> 14:27.100
Bella, look at this.

14:27.134 --> 14:29.669
This would look great--
you'd look awesome in this.

14:29.702 --> 14:33.173
This is really hot.

14:33.206 --> 14:34.674
That's not hot, Bella.

14:34.707 --> 14:37.044
That's ridiculous.

14:38.611 --> 14:41.114
- Is this about Barry?
- What?

14:41.148 --> 14:43.550
You do not need to dress
like a teenager

14:43.583 --> 14:45.552
to keep him
interested in you.

14:45.585 --> 14:48.588
Wow. Fuck you.

14:49.990 --> 14:51.691
He should be happy
to have you at all.

14:51.724 --> 14:53.193
That's all I'm saying.

14:56.029 --> 15:00.233
Oh. Look who's gonna
lecture me about happy.

15:00.267 --> 15:01.468
Look at you, Lee.

15:01.501 --> 15:03.570
You have a good marriage.

15:03.603 --> 15:05.172
You have
a beautiful child.

15:05.205 --> 15:07.707
You have a home.
You have a studio.

15:07.740 --> 15:10.510
And you are
still pissed off.

15:10.543 --> 15:13.346
You are still
dissatisfied.

15:13.380 --> 15:15.582
Why is that, Lee?
Huh?

15:15.615 --> 15:17.150
What's it gonna take?

15:17.184 --> 15:19.052
How perfect
does your shit
need to be

15:19.086 --> 15:22.589
before you let yourself
even feel an ounce of joy?

15:22.622 --> 15:25.725
Don't talk to me
about happy, okay?

15:25.758 --> 15:28.228
Don't talk to me
about anything.

15:37.504 --> 15:40.073
( music playing on TV )

15:40.107 --> 15:44.177
Listen, uh, Atomic,
I'm not sure I can take
much more of this.

15:44.211 --> 15:46.346
Yeah, I hear ya.

15:46.379 --> 15:49.582
Look, if you wanna choose
the model, that's fine by me.

15:49.616 --> 15:51.418
I don't even know why
they use a model anyway.

15:51.451 --> 15:54.221
It's not like anybody
doesn't know what they do.

15:54.254 --> 15:55.388
Or what tits look like.

15:55.422 --> 15:56.990
Exactly.

15:58.191 --> 15:59.326
All right.

15:59.359 --> 16:01.294
You know,
I was thinking...

16:01.328 --> 16:05.565
maybe they shouldn't even
have a Wonderbra model
anymore, you know?

16:05.598 --> 16:08.735
I mean, I don't--
you're the creative director.
You know better than me.

16:08.768 --> 16:11.338
But, like, maybe
all they need to do

16:11.371 --> 16:13.773
is own big.

16:13.806 --> 16:15.742
Well, this is my first day
on the account,

16:15.775 --> 16:18.378
so, you know, your guess
is as good as mine.

16:18.411 --> 16:22.249
I just think, like, all this
"supporting greatness" shit,
it's weak, man.

16:22.282 --> 16:24.551
It's like they're embarrassed
to be who they are.

16:24.584 --> 16:27.687
People like big tits.
All people.

16:27.720 --> 16:29.522
Except for the people
that don't, and fuck them.

16:29.556 --> 16:31.758
They're not buying
Wonderbras anyway.

16:31.791 --> 16:33.693
So let's just own big.

16:33.726 --> 16:35.462
Americans like big.

16:35.495 --> 16:38.398
Big burgers,
big trucks, big tits.

16:38.431 --> 16:41.134
- ( laughs )
- You don't even need to see
some chick, you know?

16:41.168 --> 16:42.635
You don't even need
to see the product.

16:42.669 --> 16:45.372
You just open up
on, uh-- on...

16:45.405 --> 16:48.141
I don't know, you open up on
the Great Wall of China, right?

16:48.175 --> 16:49.809
And you see
how huge it is, right?

16:49.842 --> 16:51.811
You know, it's gigantic.
Miles long, all that shit.

16:51.844 --> 16:53.513
And then the title
comes up.

16:53.546 --> 16:55.682
"Nobody travels
halfway around the world

16:55.715 --> 16:58.118
to see the Medium
Wall of China."

16:58.151 --> 16:59.152
Logo comes up.

16:59.186 --> 17:01.721
"Wonderbra.
Go big."

17:01.754 --> 17:05.258
Or, you know, whatever.

17:05.292 --> 17:06.726
Yeah, no, that's--

17:06.759 --> 17:09.262
yeah, I guess people don't
come back from Yosemite

17:09.296 --> 17:11.831
and claim to have seen
Littlefoot.

17:11.864 --> 17:13.700
( laughs )

17:13.733 --> 17:16.836
Lee:
Maybe Bella's right.

17:16.869 --> 17:19.572
Maybe there is
something wrong with me.

17:19.606 --> 17:20.640
There's nothing
wrong with you.

17:20.673 --> 17:22.542
I hate sand, too.

17:22.575 --> 17:23.776
Well, they don't.

17:23.810 --> 17:26.079
They all seem
really happy with it.

17:26.113 --> 17:28.481
Because they're insane.
It's just sand.

17:28.515 --> 17:30.550
The only reason
they like it is they
can't admit they hate it

17:30.583 --> 17:31.851
'cause they're
stuck in it.

17:31.884 --> 17:33.553
Because it's supposed
to be the promised land,

17:33.586 --> 17:35.255
and they can't admit
that it's not,

17:35.288 --> 17:36.022
that they were lied to.

17:36.055 --> 17:38.325
They were shortchanged,
you know?

17:38.358 --> 17:41.094
And, I don't know,
maybe there is
a promised land,

17:41.128 --> 17:43.596
maybe there isn't,
but this isn't it.

17:43.630 --> 17:46.599
This-- this can't be it,
I mean, you know,

17:46.633 --> 17:49.702
however much they need
to believe that it is.

17:50.837 --> 17:53.440
It's, like,
I wasn't happy in Egypt.

17:53.473 --> 17:56.143
I wasn't happy in the desert
and I'm not happy here.

17:56.176 --> 18:01.114
It's like--
it's like I'm broken.

18:01.148 --> 18:05.218
It's like I-- I--
I'm not happy anywhere.

18:05.252 --> 18:08.821
Baby, we'll--
we'll keep looking, okay?

18:08.855 --> 18:11.224
We're gonna find it.
I promise.

18:17.797 --> 18:21.401
( chattering )

18:22.902 --> 18:24.771
Oh, my God,
look at these!

18:24.804 --> 18:27.407
- These ones here.
- I know!

18:33.546 --> 18:37.250
( chattering )

18:44.291 --> 18:46.259
Oy.

18:46.293 --> 18:47.794
I'm lost.

18:47.827 --> 18:49.762
Who isn't?

18:49.796 --> 18:51.531
I gotta get out of here.

18:51.564 --> 18:53.666
Me, too.
Come on, let's go.

18:53.700 --> 18:55.635
Oh, you're gonna
show me the way out?

18:55.668 --> 18:56.803
I don't have
that kind of time.

18:56.836 --> 18:58.505
Hey, don't bust
my balls, Lee.

18:58.538 --> 19:02.209
Christ. You get lost once,
they never let you forget it.

19:02.242 --> 19:04.344
Trust me.
This way.

19:06.579 --> 19:08.415
Shit.

19:08.448 --> 19:10.483
Wait.

19:10.517 --> 19:12.585
No, no.

19:12.619 --> 19:14.687
No, this isn't right.

19:14.721 --> 19:16.656
So it's your fault.

19:16.689 --> 19:19.426
You started all this
"promised land" shit.

19:19.459 --> 19:24.264
Look, if I said
I was taking everybody
to "regular land,"

19:24.297 --> 19:27.434
or, uh-- or "land
that can't replace

19:27.467 --> 19:31.571
the gaping emotional
empty hole in your heart,"

19:31.604 --> 19:35.208
you think anybody
would have followed me?

19:35.242 --> 19:37.910
If I've learned one thing
in life, it's this.

19:37.944 --> 19:39.879
Promised land.

19:39.912 --> 19:41.948
Land of opportunity.

19:41.981 --> 19:44.551
Shining city on the hill.

19:46.619 --> 19:49.422
It's just sand.

19:52.559 --> 19:54.861
How the fuck
do you get out of here?

19:54.894 --> 19:56.463
( elevator dings )

19:56.496 --> 19:58.565
( sighs )

19:58.598 --> 20:02.502
So what do I do?
Do I fake it?

20:02.535 --> 20:04.471
Yes.

20:04.504 --> 20:07.874
You take joy wherever
you can find it,

20:07.907 --> 20:11.278
even if it's bullshit.

20:11.311 --> 20:14.347
You know,
Lee, I never made it
to the promised land.

20:14.381 --> 20:16.849
I died before we got in,
but my kids made it in.

20:16.883 --> 20:19.586
And that's all that's
important in the end.

20:19.619 --> 20:21.454
They made it in.

20:21.488 --> 20:24.524
They've been
happy there ever since.

20:24.557 --> 20:26.759
You don't follow
the news much, do you, Mo?

20:26.793 --> 20:28.861
( chuckles )

20:30.530 --> 20:31.964
We're here.

20:31.998 --> 20:33.800
Oh. I found it.

20:33.833 --> 20:36.903
( blows raspberry )
My ass.

20:36.936 --> 20:39.839
You know what?

20:39.872 --> 20:42.275
I'm gonna find
some bullshit.

20:43.410 --> 20:46.913
And I'm gonna hit
The Cheesecake Factory.

20:46.946 --> 20:48.781
Just purchasing
the one item today?

20:48.815 --> 20:51.318
Cashier:
Just returning
the one item today?

20:51.351 --> 20:52.685
What was wrong
with them?

20:52.719 --> 20:54.521
They're cheap
and slutty.

20:54.554 --> 20:56.055
That's why
I'm buying 'em.

20:56.088 --> 20:59.359
( cash registers beeping )

21:02.028 --> 21:04.564
I returned
all the shit
I bought.

21:04.597 --> 21:08.535
I'm buying all the shit
that you returned.

21:11.404 --> 21:12.939
What now?

21:12.972 --> 21:14.874
I can't drive.

21:14.907 --> 21:17.377
Ugh. I can't drive.

21:18.478 --> 21:20.046
Any ideas?

21:20.079 --> 21:24.684
Well, obviously we should
go have another round
of appletinis

21:24.717 --> 21:26.453
and ride the Ferris wheel.

21:26.486 --> 21:28.855
Obviously!

21:30.590 --> 21:34.026
Atomic:
Nobody would care much
for the Less Than Grand Canyon.

21:34.060 --> 21:36.663
Nobody claims
to have seen Mediumfoot.

21:36.696 --> 21:38.965
And nobody would travel
halfway around the world

21:38.998 --> 21:41.734
to see the Not-So-Great
Wall of China.

21:41.768 --> 21:44.471
Wonderbra.
Go big.

21:45.838 --> 21:48.541
( slow clap )

21:48.575 --> 21:50.042
Thom:
It's a great idea, guys.

21:50.076 --> 21:52.345
It's strong
and it's simple,

21:52.379 --> 21:54.914
and it gets away
from that crappy imagery
they've been stuck with.

21:54.947 --> 21:58.585
- It's not even close
to their strategy.
- Fuck the strategy.

21:58.618 --> 22:00.420
Lisa:
They wanna be seen
as supporting women.

22:00.453 --> 22:03.089
They wanna be human
and approachable.

22:03.122 --> 22:05.692
They don't support women.
They-- they do that.

22:05.725 --> 22:08.928
Andrea Dworkin
never wore a Wonderbra.

22:08.961 --> 22:10.863
Andrea Dworkin
never wore any bra.

22:10.897 --> 22:12.399
Maybe if it said
something like,

22:12.432 --> 22:14.133
"Hey, this is
the Great Wall of China,

22:14.166 --> 22:15.935
and you can
be great, too."

22:15.968 --> 22:18.471
If you had bigger tits.

22:18.505 --> 22:21.574
Look, they spent millions on
"supporting greatness," Thom.

22:21.608 --> 22:25.478
I get this
is a clever idea and all,
but there's just no way.

22:33.520 --> 22:35.021
Welcome to MGT.

22:35.054 --> 22:37.023
Oh, hey, no worries, man.

22:37.056 --> 22:39.592
I just started here.

22:39.626 --> 22:42.495
- I'm sorry to hear that.
- ( chuckles )

22:42.529 --> 22:46.065
Well, back to
watching titties.

22:46.098 --> 22:51.471
( Lee and Bella
cheering, laughing )

22:51.504 --> 22:54.407
Lee:
Welcome to
the promised land!

22:54.441 --> 22:57.610
Welcome to
the promised land!

22:57.644 --> 22:59.779
( laughs, snorts )

22:59.812 --> 23:01.013
- You know what?
- What?

23:01.047 --> 23:03.015
Honey...

23:03.049 --> 23:05.752
you were right.

23:05.785 --> 23:09.121
This was a great idea!

23:10.089 --> 23:11.958
Lee:
Hey, let us down!

23:11.991 --> 23:14.594
We have more
shopping to do!

23:14.627 --> 23:16.696
Let us go!

23:16.729 --> 23:19.766
Let my penis go!

23:19.799 --> 23:21.568
( laughs )

23:21.601 --> 23:25.071
Let my penis go!

23:25.104 --> 23:27.707
We need more stuff!

23:27.740 --> 23:32.679
Let my penis go!

23:32.712 --> 23:38.485
Lee:
And behold, Abraham arose
in the morning, and he left.

23:38.518 --> 23:41.654
Guess that's why
I always liked Abraham.

23:41.688 --> 23:43.823
At least he left.

23:43.856 --> 23:47.126
At least he kept trying
to find a better place.

23:48.661 --> 23:50.563
You should go back
to that store.

23:50.597 --> 23:53.232
- ( laughs )
- I'm serious.

23:53.265 --> 23:54.967
See if they have 'em
in your size?

23:55.001 --> 23:57.103
- Yeah.
- ( music playing )

23:59.071 --> 24:01.073
Come here.
Come here.

24:15.522 --> 24:16.789
Lee:
And also, I mean, come on.

24:16.823 --> 24:19.559
He fucked his wife
when she was 90.

24:19.592 --> 24:22.228
That's pretty
fuckin' awesome, guys.

24:24.664 --> 24:27.734
* If you're happy

24:27.767 --> 24:30.169
