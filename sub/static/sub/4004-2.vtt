11:56.041 --> 11:57.208
I CAN TOO.

12:15.166 --> 12:17.583
FOCUS ON THE KIDS.

12:17.583 --> 12:20.792
- WOW, I DIDN'T KNOW YOU
WERE GONNA BRING SO MUCH.

12:20.792 --> 12:22.041
YOU CAN JUST PUT THAT...

12:22.041 --> 12:23.041
- [grunts]

12:23.041 --> 12:24.000
- RIGHT THERE IS GREAT.

12:24.000 --> 12:25.458
- I EMPTIED THE REFRIGERATOR.

12:25.458 --> 12:27.667
SOMEONE LEFT
ANOTHER CAKE AT THE DOOR.

12:27.667 --> 12:29.208
- I JUST ATE
A WHOLE TUNA CASSEROLE

12:29.208 --> 12:31.041
TO MAKE ROOM IN THE APARTMENT.

12:31.041 --> 12:32.792
CODY, THIS IS A GOOD JOB
FOR YOU.

12:32.792 --> 12:34.166
WANNA HELP ME
UNLOAD THE FOOD?

12:34.166 --> 12:35.875
- OKAY.

12:37.792 --> 12:41.417
- WOW. YOU SURE DO HAVE
A LOT OF BEER, AUNT DEB.

12:41.417 --> 12:42.917
[Deb chuckles]

12:42.917 --> 12:44.250
- UH...

12:44.250 --> 12:46.834
PEOPLE JUST KEEP BRINGING IT.

12:46.834 --> 12:48.083
HEH.

12:48.083 --> 12:50.834
- THIS IS ALL YOU BROUGHT?

12:50.834 --> 12:53.500
- UH, WELL, WE'RE A LITTLE
SHORT ON SPACE.

12:53.500 --> 12:55.542
- YOU DIDN'T EVEN
BRING THE RIGHT CLOTHES.

12:55.542 --> 12:57.000
THIS WAS MY REJECT STUFF.

12:57.000 --> 12:58.417
I CAN'T WEAR
ANY OF THIS TO SCHOOL.

12:58.417 --> 13:01.417
- ASTOR, COME ON.
NO ONE'S GONNA NOTICE YOU.

13:01.417 --> 13:02.542
- [gasps]

13:04.834 --> 13:06.458
- UHH, OKAY.

13:06.458 --> 13:07.625
HONEY, WOULD YOU
HOLD THE BABY?

13:07.625 --> 13:09.875
- COME HERE.
- CODY.

13:09.875 --> 13:15.000
WHY DON'T YOU HELP US
CARRY THE LAST LOAD IN, HMM?

13:15.000 --> 13:17.750
- I LIKE IT HERE.
IT'S LIKE CAMPING.

13:19.166 --> 13:21.250
- EXACTLY.

13:21.250 --> 13:23.000
BOYS ARE EASIER.

13:32.166 --> 13:34.917
IT DOESN'T MATTER HOW MUCH
I LOVE MY CHILDREN,

13:34.917 --> 13:36.834
I'M STILL A CREATURE
OF THE NIGHT.

13:39.166 --> 13:42.083
[baby fussing]

13:45.125 --> 13:46.834
- CAN'T SLEEP EITHER?

13:50.250 --> 13:54.667
THE BLOOD
PROBABLY MEANS NOTHING.

13:54.667 --> 13:58.959
SOMEONE CUT THEIR FINGER
WHILE MOVING.

13:58.959 --> 14:00.792
BUT I WON'T BE ABLE
TO PUT IT OUT OF MY MIND

14:00.792 --> 14:04.208
UNTIL I KNOW FOR SURE.

14:04.208 --> 14:06.667
[truck door rattling]

14:09.000 --> 14:12.208
[spraying]

14:12.208 --> 14:13.583
- SOMEONE DID
A QUICK CLEANUP JOB,

14:13.583 --> 14:15.375
BUT FORGOT
TO WASH THE DOOR.

14:15.375 --> 14:17.041
[baby coos]

14:17.041 --> 14:18.291
[whispering]
YEAH, IT'S PRETTY.

14:18.291 --> 14:19.375
I KNOW.

14:21.709 --> 14:23.875
BUT NOT THE STORY
IT TELLS.

14:26.333 --> 14:28.250
ONCE UPON A TIME,

14:28.250 --> 14:29.500
AN EVIL GREEN OGRE

14:29.500 --> 14:33.041
LEFT A CIRCULAR SPATTER
AT THREE FEET HIGH,

14:33.041 --> 14:36.125
CONSISTENT WITH
BLUNT FORCE TRAUMA...

14:36.125 --> 14:39.667
WHICH SEEMS TO INDICATE
THE HANDSOME YOUNG PRINCE

14:39.667 --> 14:41.709
WAS HIT WHILE ON HIS KNEES,

14:41.709 --> 14:43.500
AT LEAST TWO OR THREE TIMES.

14:47.208 --> 14:50.375
OR THE PRINCESS
WAS ON HER KNEES.

14:50.375 --> 14:52.208
SMALL HANDS.

14:52.208 --> 14:54.041
FEMALE.

15:04.834 --> 15:08.417
- [sighs]

15:08.417 --> 15:11.583
- I THOUGHT THE KIDS WERE
YOUR NUMBER ONE RESPONSIBILITY.

15:11.583 --> 15:13.542
- THEY ARE.
- BUT HERE YOU ARE...

15:13.542 --> 15:14.709
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT.

15:14.709 --> 15:17.208
- IT'S NOT THAT SIMPLE.

15:17.208 --> 15:18.208
- IT NEVER IS.

15:19.792 --> 15:21.917
- IT'S LIKE WHEN
YOU GET ON A PLANE.

15:21.917 --> 15:24.417
THEY TELL YOU
IF THE OXYGEN MASKS COME DOWN

15:24.417 --> 15:25.959
TO PUT YOURS ON FIRST

15:25.959 --> 15:27.083
BEFORE HELPING THE KIDS.

15:27.083 --> 15:29.750
I HAVE TO TAKE CARE
OF MY OWN NEEDS TOO.

15:29.750 --> 15:33.583
OTHERWISE, I RISK
SPINNING OUT OF CONTROL.

15:33.583 --> 15:35.250
THAT'S NOT GOOD FOR ANYONE.

15:35.250 --> 15:37.500
- I'M NOT JUST SAYING THIS
FOR THE SAKE OF THE KIDS, DEX,

15:37.500 --> 15:39.083
BUT FOR YOU.

15:39.083 --> 15:42.417
THEY'RE NOT ONLY
YOUR RESPONSIBILITY.

15:42.417 --> 15:44.083
THEY'RE YOUR SALVATION.

15:51.750 --> 15:53.083
- I HAVE TO GIVE HIM
A BOTTLE.

16:11.875 --> 16:14.250
NO REASON
A TRUCK RENTAL AGENCY

16:14.250 --> 16:16.667
WOULD PUT ANY SERIOUS
SAFEGUARDS ON THEIR RECORDS.

16:19.375 --> 16:23.542
THE TRUCK WAS MOST RECENTLY
RENTED TO BOYD FOWLER.

16:23.542 --> 16:25.750
BOYD SEEMS TO HAVE
LISTED HIS ADDRESS

16:25.750 --> 16:28.417
AS THE DEPARTMENT
OF SANITATION.

16:28.417 --> 16:31.500
NO HOME ADDRESS.

16:31.500 --> 16:34.083
MIAMI-DADE COUNTY DEPARTMENT
OF SANITATION,

16:34.083 --> 16:36.667
DIVISION OF
DEAD ANIMAL PICKUP,

16:36.667 --> 16:38.917
MEANING THE BLOOD BELONGS
TO AN ANIMAL.

16:44.000 --> 16:46.458
BUT WHAT ABOUT THOSE
LITTLE HAND PRINTS?

17:01.834 --> 17:04.000
TWO LINES.

17:04.000 --> 17:05.125
HUMAN.

17:24.083 --> 17:26.542
- WELL, WELL, WELL.
WHAT DO WE GOT HERE?

17:26.542 --> 17:29.667
- RACCOON.

17:29.667 --> 17:31.417
- YOU CALL THIS IN?
- YEAH, I DID.

17:31.417 --> 17:32.583
I WAS DRIVING DOWN THE ROAD,

17:32.583 --> 17:34.542
AND...I SAW IT.

17:34.542 --> 17:36.333
KIND OF CREEPS ME OUT.

17:36.333 --> 17:38.959
YOU'RE PROBABLY USED TO
SEEING DEAD THINGS, THOUGH, HUH?

17:38.959 --> 17:40.917
- CAN'T SAY I EVER
GET USED TO IT.

17:40.917 --> 17:42.291
- I DON'T USUALLY
COME THIS WAY,

17:42.291 --> 17:43.875
BUT I'M IN THE MIDDLE
OF MOVING TO A NEW PLACE.

17:43.875 --> 17:46.166
IT'S A HASSLE, HUH?
MOVING?

17:46.166 --> 17:47.542
- I WOULDN'T KNOW.
- NO?

17:47.542 --> 17:50.583
- LIVED IN THE SAME HOUSE
FOR OVER 20 YEARS.

17:50.583 --> 17:52.041
- SO WHY DID YOU
RENT A MOVING VAN?

17:52.041 --> 17:54.000
- HELLO THERE, BANDIT.

17:56.667 --> 17:58.917
THIS DON'T LOOK RIGHT.

17:58.917 --> 18:00.375
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

18:00.375 --> 18:02.166
- WELL, USUALLY, YOU FIND A DEAD
ANIMAL IN THE ROAD,

18:02.166 --> 18:03.875
IT MEANS HE WAS
HIT BY A CAR.

18:03.875 --> 18:05.917
BUT THERE'S NO TIRE MARKS
OR BLOOD ON THE ASPHALT.

18:05.917 --> 18:08.834
THIS RACCOON WAS KILLED
SOMEPLACE ELSE AND DROPPED HERE.

18:08.834 --> 18:10.542
- HE'S C.S.I.-ing ME.

18:16.667 --> 18:18.917
- HE'S GOT
DEFENSIVE WOUNDS ON HIS PAWS.

18:18.917 --> 18:20.375
LITTLE GUY PUT UP
QUITE A STRUGGLE.

18:31.959 --> 18:34.291
ALRIGHTY THEN.

18:34.291 --> 18:36.542
[engine starts]

18:40.083 --> 18:42.083
- HE'S DEFINITELY PECULIAR.

18:42.083 --> 18:43.792
BUT I GUESS
THE BEST AND BRIGHTEST

18:43.792 --> 18:46.417
DON'T TYPICALLY GET INTO
DEAD ANIMAL PICKUP.

18:51.667 --> 18:55.542
[indistinct chatter]

18:55.542 --> 18:57.083
- JUST SO YOU KNOW, OKAY?

18:57.083 --> 18:59.625
- WHAT DO WE GOT?

18:59.625 --> 19:01.125
- WE GOT A FEMALE VICTIM.

19:01.125 --> 19:02.792
PART OF
A FEMALE VICTIM.

19:02.792 --> 19:04.291
- PART?
- WE GOT A HEAD.

19:04.291 --> 19:06.000
- JUST A HEAD?

19:06.000 --> 19:07.125
- YEAH.

19:07.125 --> 19:08.291
DECAPITATION.

19:08.291 --> 19:09.875
PROBABLY SOME KIND
OF DRUG KILLING.

19:09.875 --> 19:10.917
- NICE.

19:15.667 --> 19:18.959
LET ME ASK YOU A QUESTION,
HYPOTHETICAL.

19:18.959 --> 19:21.458
SAY A NEWLY-MARRIED PERSON...
- MM-HMM.

19:21.458 --> 19:24.208
- ACCIDENTALLY DISCOVERS
THAT HIS OR HER NEW SPOUSE

19:24.208 --> 19:26.417
HAS A SAVINGS ACCOUNT
WITH A LOT OF MONEY.

19:26.417 --> 19:30.083
IS THAT SOMETHING THAT ONE
SHOULD EXPECT TO SHARE?

19:30.083 --> 19:32.500
- FUCK, NO.
THAT'S YOUR MONEY.

19:32.500 --> 19:34.792
YOU TELL THE LIEUTENANT TO KEEP
HER FUCKIN' HANDS OFF IT.

19:37.834 --> 19:38.834
- TAKE ME TO THE HEAD.

19:38.834 --> 19:40.333
- ALL RIGHT.

19:40.333 --> 19:42.208
[indistinct atter]

19:46.667 --> 19:49.959
- SHE WAS STILL ALIVE
WHEN THEY CUT HER HEAD OFF.

19:49.959 --> 19:52.166
EXCISION OF EYES AND TONGUE
WAS DONE POST-MORTEM.

19:52.166 --> 19:53.667
- THAT'S CONSIDERATE OF THEM.

19:53.667 --> 19:55.667
- YOU WERE RIGHT.

19:55.667 --> 19:57.166
IT'S JUST A HEAD.

19:57.166 --> 19:59.500
- UNLESS THEY BURIED HER
STANDING UP.

20:03.291 --> 20:05.208
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

20:05.208 --> 20:07.458
- JUST TRYING TO HELP YOU.
LOOKING A LITTLE RAGGED.

20:07.458 --> 20:08.542
- I'M EXHAUSTED.

20:08.542 --> 20:10.208
THERE ARE FIVE PEOPLE
IN MY TINY APARTMENT.

20:10.208 --> 20:11.625
I SHARED A BED
WITH ASTOR LAST NIGHT,

20:11.625 --> 20:13.250
AND SHE KICKED ME
ALL NIGHT LONG.

20:13.250 --> 20:15.083
- YOU KNOW, YOU'RE WELCOME
TO CRASH AT MY PLACE,

20:15.083 --> 20:16.166
IF YOU WANT.

20:16.166 --> 20:18.500
- UH, NO THANKS, DETECTIVE.

20:18.500 --> 20:19.834
- OKAY.

20:22.041 --> 20:25.000
- IT LOOKS LIKE SANTA MUERTE.

20:25.000 --> 20:26.583
- WHAT?

20:26.583 --> 20:29.625
- SANTA MUERTE, THE CULT.
"SAINT DEATH."

20:29.625 --> 20:31.750
- YEAH, I KNOW WHAT IT IS,
BUT WHY DO YOU SAY THAT?

20:31.750 --> 20:33.917
- WELL, THE MISSING EYES
AND TONGUE

20:33.917 --> 20:35.500
WERE MEANT TO SEND A MESSAGE.

20:35.500 --> 20:38.083
YOU DIDN'T SEE ANYTHING,
YOU'RE NOT GONNA SAY ANYTHING.

20:38.083 --> 20:39.417
- WHO ARE YOU?

20:39.417 --> 20:42.000
- OFFICER MANZON.
CIRA.

20:42.000 --> 20:43.583
THE GOLDEN CANDLES MEAN MONEY.

20:43.583 --> 20:45.000
THE ICONS, I DON'T KNOW.

20:45.000 --> 20:46.875
THERE'S SO MANY NOW.

20:46.875 --> 20:48.041
MIGHT NEED AN EXPERT ON IT.

20:48.041 --> 20:49.542
- AND YOU KNOW
ALL OF THIS BECAUSE...

20:49.542 --> 20:50.542
IT'S MY NEIGHBORHOOD.

20:50.542 --> 20:53.583
AND IF IT IS
SANTA MUERTE...

20:53.583 --> 20:55.291
THEY USED A MACHETE ON HER.

20:55.291 --> 20:56.750
- OKAY, WELL,
WE'LL KEEP THAT IN MIND.

20:56.750 --> 20:59.041
BUT THIS PARK IS
A LOCAL DRUG HANGOUT,

20:59.041 --> 21:00.458
AND DRUG CARTELS LIKE
TO CUT HEADS OFF.

21:00.458 --> 21:01.875
SO WE MIGHT
FOLLOW THAT LEAD.

21:01.875 --> 21:03.709
- OF COURSE.

21:03.709 --> 21:05.458
- HEY...WE FOUND THE BODY

21:05.458 --> 21:09.166
ON THE OTHER END OF THE PARK,
UNDER THE BUSHES, NO I.D.

21:09.166 --> 21:12.625
GOTTA CANVASS THE NEIGHBORHOOD,
START ASKING QUESTIONS.

21:12.625 --> 21:14.750
- NO ONE WILL TALK.
THEY'RE TOO AFRAID.

21:14.750 --> 21:16.750
- WELL, WE STILL ASK,
OFFICER.

21:21.375 --> 21:24.417
- "HELPING YOUR CHILDREN
COPE WITH GRIEF."

21:27.000 --> 21:28.709
"GRANDPA'S GONE TO HEAVEN."

21:31.041 --> 21:32.750
"SAYING GOOD-BYE TO FLUFFY."

21:32.750 --> 21:36.417
BUT NOTHING ON
"MOMMY BLED OUT IN A BATHTUB."

21:49.000 --> 21:52.125
BOYD FOWLER,
YOU HAVE A PRISON RECORD.

21:52.125 --> 21:54.041
ASSAULT WITH A DEADLY WEAPON.

21:54.041 --> 21:56.333
18 MONTHS AT OKEECHOBEE.

21:59.583 --> 22:00.959
YOU SAID YOU LIVED IN A HOUSE,

22:00.959 --> 22:05.125
BUT THERE ARE NO MORTGAGE
RECORDS IN YOUR NAME.

22:05.125 --> 22:09.458
IN THE SAME HOUSE
FOR OVER 20 YEARS.

22:09.458 --> 22:12.792
YOU INHERITED IT
FROM YOUR PARENTS,

22:12.792 --> 22:15.875
RICH AND ELSIE FOWLER
IN OPA-LOCKA.

22:15.875 --> 22:17.291
[keys rattling in door]

22:20.750 --> 22:22.250
HEY.

22:22.250 --> 22:23.875
HOW WAS YOUR DAY?

22:23.875 --> 22:26.667
- A WHOLE AFTERNOON GETTING
DOORS SHUT IN MY FACE.

22:26.667 --> 22:28.917
- SORRY.

22:28.917 --> 22:32.000
- YOU?

22:32.000 --> 22:33.458
- OKAY.

22:33.458 --> 22:36.291
WE FINISHED LAGUERTA'S
CASEROLA DE CAMARONES

22:36.291 --> 22:37.709
AND MASUKA'S
CHOCOLATE LAVA CAKE,

22:37.709 --> 22:40.250
AND ASTOR TOLD ME
SHE HATED LIVING HERE.

22:40.250 --> 22:44.000
THEY'RE BOTH
ASLEEP IN THE BED.

22:44.000 --> 22:46.166
LOOKING AT APARTMENTS.

22:46.166 --> 22:50.291
- SO IT'S EVERYTHING
AS USUAL.

22:50.291 --> 22:51.583
- [sighs]

22:51.583 --> 22:54.000
THEY'RE SEEING
A GRIEF COUNSELOR TOMORROW.

22:54.000 --> 22:56.875
- MAYBE THAT'LL HELP.

22:56.875 --> 22:58.792
STILL, EVEN AFTER...

22:58.792 --> 23:01.250
- WHAT?

23:01.250 --> 23:03.083
- YOU'RE GONNA BE
A SINGLE DAD

23:03.083 --> 23:05.083
RAISING THREE KIDS.

23:05.083 --> 23:07.542
GONNA BE HARD.

23:07.542 --> 23:09.458
RITA WAS A GREAT MOM.

23:09.458 --> 23:11.333
- THERE'S NOTHING I CAN DO
TO MAKE UP FOR THAT.

23:11.333 --> 23:13.500
BUT I'M GONNA HAVE TO TRY.

23:16.375 --> 23:20.041
- WELL, I'LL BE HERE.

23:20.041 --> 23:20.917
YOU CAN COUNT ON ME.

23:23.000 --> 23:25.000
THE KIDS'LL BE OKAY.

23:31.959 --> 23:33.041
I KNOW THAT PLACE.

23:33.041 --> 23:36.000
IT'S NEAR THE STATION.

23:36.000 --> 23:37.250
THEY HAVE AN OPEN HOUSE
TOMORROW.

23:37.250 --> 23:38.208
MAYBE I'LL CHECK IT OUT
FOR YOU.

23:38.208 --> 23:41.083
- GREAT.

23:41.083 --> 23:42.834
YOU WANT THE COUCH TONIGHT?

23:42.834 --> 23:44.583
- NO, YOU TAKE IT.

24:07.583 --> 24:10.792
[dialing]

24:10.792 --> 24:12.625
[line ringing]

24:14.917 --> 24:16.083
- HEY.
- HI.

24:16.083 --> 24:17.583
- GLAD YOU CALLED.

24:17.583 --> 24:19.250
- HEY, FUCK PUDDLE.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

24:19.250 --> 24:20.375
- JUST GIVING YOU
A KISS HELLO.

24:20.375 --> 24:21.959
- I-I CAME OVER HERE
TO SLEEP,

24:21.959 --> 24:24.709
NOT TO HAVE YOUR FAT LITTLE
SAUSAGE FINGERS ALL OVER ME.

24:24.709 --> 24:26.083
- [chuckles]

24:29.208 --> 24:31.458
THERE'S NO ROOM FOR ME
AT MY OWN PLACE.

24:31.458 --> 24:36.083
UNLESS I WANT TO CURL UP INSIDE
A FUCKIN' TOASTER OVEN.

24:36.083 --> 24:37.458
[grunts]

24:37.458 --> 24:39.542
I'M TRYING SO HARD
TO BE A GOOD SISTER,

24:39.542 --> 24:41.709
'CAUSE FUCK KNOWS, DEXTER'S
ALWAYS BEEN THE BEST BROTHER.

24:41.709 --> 24:45.458
BUT...IT IS
FUCKING EXHAUSTING.

24:45.458 --> 24:46.625
- I'M SURE.

24:46.625 --> 24:47.792
WELL, LOOK,

24:47.792 --> 24:50.709
YOU'RE, UH,
WELCOME TO STAY HERE

24:50.709 --> 24:52.083
FOR AS LONG AS YOU WANT,

24:52.083 --> 24:53.709
WHENEVER YOU WANT.

24:53.709 --> 24:57.000
AND I PROMISE TO KEEP MY FAT
LITTLE SAUSAGE FINGERS OFF YOU.

24:57.000 --> 24:58.458
- YOU BETTER.

24:58.458 --> 25:00.542
- HOW'S YOUR BROTHER?
- YOU KNOW.

25:00.542 --> 25:02.208
- I HEARD THE FBI INTERVIEW
WENT WELL.

25:02.208 --> 25:03.417
I MEAN, THAT MUST
BE A LOAD OFF.

25:03.417 --> 25:04.583
- WHY WOULD
THAT BE A LOAD OFF?

25:04.583 --> 25:06.625
- [scoffs] NOTHIN'.
NEVER MIND.

25:06.625 --> 25:09.166
- THEY'RE LOOKING FOR SOMEONE
NAMED KYLE BUTLER

25:09.166 --> 25:10.667
WHO'S A FRIEND
OF ARTHUR MITCHELL'S.

25:10.667 --> 25:11.875
THEY THINK
IF THEY CAN FIND HIM,

25:11.875 --> 25:13.250
THEN HE CAN LEAD THEM
TO MITCHELL.

25:13.250 --> 25:14.083
- BUT THEY CAN'T FIND HIM?

25:14.083 --> 25:15.458
- WELL, NOT YET.

25:15.458 --> 25:16.583
THEY'RE HAVING SKETCHES DONE.

25:16.583 --> 25:18.166
THEY'RE TRYING TO GET
A POSITIVE I.D.

25:18.166 --> 25:19.542
KYLE BUTLER.

25:19.542 --> 25:21.000
WHY DOES THAT NAME
SOUND SO FAMILIAR?

25:21.000 --> 25:22.125
- WELL, THAT'S
THE WEIRD THING.

25:22.125 --> 25:23.667
WE WORKED THAT CASE,
REMEMBER?

25:23.667 --> 25:25.083
A DEAD KYLE BUTLER.

25:25.083 --> 25:27.000
- RIGHT, HE GOT HIS HEAD
SMASHED IN.

25:27.000 --> 25:29.583
WENT UNSOLVED.

25:29.583 --> 25:31.792
ANY CONNECTION?
- I DON'T KNOW.

25:31.792 --> 25:35.291
I'M SURE THE FBI WILL
FIND A WAY TO FUCK IT UP.

25:35.291 --> 25:37.625
WILL YOU GET THE LIGHTS?

25:37.625 --> 25:38.834
- YES, MA'AM.

25:44.417 --> 25:46.166
- WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO
FOR THE NEXT BATCH?

25:46.166 --> 25:47.959
MICKEY MOUSE, SILVER DOLLAR?

25:47.959 --> 25:50.041
GREAT BIG ONES?
- TRIANGLES.

25:50.041 --> 25:51.875
- A CHALLENGE.

25:51.875 --> 25:53.625
[sizzling]

25:53.625 --> 25:56.208
- DEXTER'S MAKING
TRIANGLE PANCAKES.

25:56.208 --> 25:58.750
- ACTUALLY,
THEY'RE MORE FREEFORM.

25:58.750 --> 26:00.917
WANNA SET THE TABLE
FOR US?

26:00.917 --> 26:02.333
- UH, SURE.

26:05.208 --> 26:07.166
THEY'RE JUST BLOBS.

26:07.166 --> 26:08.667
- HOW DARE YOU?

26:14.750 --> 26:15.917
- TRIANGLES.

26:15.917 --> 26:18.083
[laughing]

26:22.458 --> 26:25.083
I COUNTED TOO MANY PLATES.

26:26.542 --> 26:28.625
- MOM'S NOT HERE.

26:28.625 --> 26:30.417
- THAT'S OKAY.
- NO, IT'S NOT.

26:30.417 --> 26:33.125
SHE SHOULD BE HERE.
- I'M SORRY.

26:33.125 --> 26:34.709
- THAT DOESN'T
MAKE A DIFFERENCE.

26:34.709 --> 26:36.250
- ASTOR, I'M DOING
THE BEST I CAN HERE.

26:36.250 --> 26:38.667
LET'S JUST...SIT DOWN
AND HAVE SOME BREAKFAST.

26:38.667 --> 26:40.250
- I DON'T WANT TO!

26:40.250 --> 26:42.333
I WANNA GO BACK HOME!
- ASTOR--

26:42.333 --> 26:44.041
- STOP IT!
- YEAH, JUST STOP IT!

26:44.041 --> 26:46.250
- BOTH OF YOU JUST STOP
FIGHTING ALL THE TIME!

26:46.250 --> 26:47.709
I HATE IT!

26:56.625 --> 26:58.917
[door slams]

26:58.917 --> 27:00.834
- WHILE THEY'RE SEEING
THE GRIEF COUNSELOR,

27:00.834 --> 27:03.750
I'LL BE GETTING
MY OWN KIND OF THERAPY.

27:08.458 --> 27:11.083
- SO IS THIS, UH...

27:11.083 --> 27:12.709
SOMETHING WE SHOULD
TALK ABOUT?

27:12.709 --> 27:15.250
WHATEVER'S GOING ON
BETWEEN US?

27:15.250 --> 27:16.250
- NO.
- I MEAN...

27:16.250 --> 27:18.083
WE HAVE SEX ONE DAY,
AND THEN--

27:18.083 --> 27:19.333
- I'M SORRY,
I'M NOT THE KIND OF PERSON

27:19.333 --> 27:20.625
WHO WOULD EVER
HAVE SEX WITH YOU.

27:20.625 --> 27:21.709
- I DON'T KNOW
WHAT WE'RE DOING.

27:21.709 --> 27:22.917
- WE'RE NOT DOING ANYTHING.

27:22.917 --> 27:24.291
WE NEVER DID DO ANYTHING.

27:24.291 --> 27:25.417
WE NEVER WILL
DO ANYTHING.

27:25.417 --> 27:27.125
- SO WE NEVER HAD SEX?
- EXACTLY.

27:27.125 --> 27:28.125
- THAT'S REALLY WEIRD.

27:28.125 --> 27:29.125
'CAUSE I REMEMBER--

27:29.125 --> 27:31.333
- I GOTTA GO NOW.
I'M GONNA GO.

27:32.750 --> 27:34.000
- [scoffs]
[door closes]

27:41.125 --> 27:42.333
- HOW'S IT GOING?

27:42.333 --> 27:44.417
- I HATE THIS SHIT.

27:46.792 --> 27:48.125
[clatter]

27:48.125 --> 27:49.875
[grunts]

27:49.875 --> 27:51.500
THIS IS DEXTER'S JOB.

27:51.500 --> 27:53.166
BLOOD. IT'S GROSS.

27:54.959 --> 27:56.417
WELL, WHOEVER
CUT THE HEAD OFF

27:56.417 --> 27:58.709
USED THE SAME WEAPON TO CUT
THE EYES AND THE TONGUE OUT.

27:58.709 --> 28:00.834
BUT I CAN'T FIND
ANYTHING THAT FITS.

28:00.834 --> 28:03.041
I MEAN, I'VE TRIED TWO SWORDS,
THREE KNIVES.

28:03.041 --> 28:04.792
- HEY...TRY THE MACHETE.

28:09.083 --> 28:10.625
- YEAH.

28:24.375 --> 28:25.750
- HUH.

28:25.750 --> 28:27.542
I THINK WE HAVE A MATCH.

28:29.709 --> 28:31.959
- I'LL SEND SOMEBODY
OVER THERE RIGHT AWAY.

28:31.959 --> 28:32.875
OKAY, YEAH.

28:40.417 --> 28:42.291
HOW'S IT GOING IN THERE?

28:42.291 --> 28:45.417
- MASUKA SAID HE REALLY
LIKES WORKING WITH THE BLOOD.

28:45.417 --> 28:47.542
HE HOPES HE CAN GET
MORE ASSIGNMENTS LIKE THIS.

28:47.542 --> 28:48.542
- I'LL KEEP THAT IN MIND.

28:48.542 --> 28:50.417
LET ME ASK YOU A QUESTION.

28:50.417 --> 28:51.333
- IF YOU WERE MARRIED...

28:51.333 --> 28:52.542
AND YOU FOUND OUT

28:52.542 --> 28:54.125
THAT THE PERSON
YOU WERE MARRIED TO

28:54.125 --> 28:55.250
HAD A SECRET BANK ACCOUNT

28:55.250 --> 28:56.959
WITH A LOT OF MONEY,

28:56.959 --> 28:58.417
YOU THINK THAT PERSON
SHOULD SHARE IT?

28:58.417 --> 29:00.041
- JESUS, ANGEL.

29:00.041 --> 29:01.625
JUST BECAUSE YOU MARRIED HER
DOESN'T MEAN YOU OWN HER.

29:01.625 --> 29:04.667
IT'S HER MONEY.
END OF STORY.

29:04.667 --> 29:06.208
- WELL, YOU GOT A DEAD BODY
WAITING FOR YOU.

29:09.542 --> 29:13.291
[indistinct chatter]

29:14.792 --> 29:17.291
- OH, FUCK ME.

29:17.291 --> 29:18.417
WHY COULDN'T HE HAVE
JUST HANGED HIMSELF,

29:18.417 --> 29:19.583
TOOK SOME PILLS...

29:19.583 --> 29:21.166
STUCK HIS HEAD IN THE OVEN?

29:21.166 --> 29:23.250
PEOPLE ARE SO RUDE.
EXCUSE ME.

29:23.250 --> 29:24.417
- YOU AGAIN.

29:24.417 --> 29:25.917
- IT'S MY NEIGHBORHOOD.

29:25.917 --> 29:28.083
- YOU WERE RIGHT
ABOUT THE MACHETE.

29:28.083 --> 29:30.583
- GOOD...I GUESS.

29:30.583 --> 29:32.208
[camera shutter clicking]

29:32.208 --> 29:33.333
- SO WHAT DO WE HAVE HERE?

29:33.333 --> 29:34.709
- WELL, GOLLY GEE, DEB,

29:34.709 --> 29:36.500
I THINK WE GOT
A SHOTGUN WOUND TO THE HEAD.

29:36.500 --> 29:38.667
APPROXIMATELY 24 HOURS AGO.

29:38.667 --> 29:40.375
- MAKE SURE
YOU SWAB THE GUN.

29:40.375 --> 29:41.917
AND CHECK HIS HANDS FOR GSR.

29:41.917 --> 29:43.542
- I GOT IT, I GOT IT.
- I'M JUST CHECKING.

29:43.542 --> 29:45.083
DEXTER USUALLY
WORKS CASES LIKE THIS.

29:45.083 --> 29:46.125
WE HAVE AN I.D.?

29:46.125 --> 29:48.542
- ACCORDING TO THIS,
FRANCISCO ALFARO.

29:48.542 --> 29:49.709
HEY, CAN WE ROLL HIM OVER?

29:51.291 --> 29:53.834
- [sighs]

29:53.834 --> 29:56.125
OH, LOOKS LIKE HIS FACE
HAS CHANGED A LITTLE

29:56.125 --> 29:58.083
SINCE HIS DRIVER'S LICENSE
PICTURE WAS TAKEN.

30:01.458 --> 30:03.583
- LOOKS LIKE HIM.

30:03.583 --> 30:06.291
HEY...CHECK OUT THE GIRL.

30:06.291 --> 30:07.792
- WHAT?
- LOOK AT HER.

30:07.792 --> 30:09.917
IMAGINE SHE HAS NO EYES
AND NO TONGUE.

30:09.917 --> 30:11.750
- HOLY SHIT.
- IT'S HER, ISN'T IT?

30:11.750 --> 30:12.917
- THOSE ARE THE EXACT,
SAME EARRINGS.

30:12.917 --> 30:15.125
WE'VE GOT OUR HEAD.

30:15.125 --> 30:16.291
- UH-HUH.

30:16.291 --> 30:18.375
BINGO--LOOKS LIKE WE GOT
A MURDER-SUICIDE HERE.

30:18.375 --> 30:19.959
- HOW YOU FIGURE?
- WELL...

30:19.959 --> 30:21.959
GUY GETS PISSED AT HIS WIFE.
CUTS HER HEAD OFF.

30:21.959 --> 30:23.959
LEAVES IT IN THE PARK
FOR EVERYONE TO SEE.

30:23.959 --> 30:26.291
AND COMES HOME,
BLOWS HIS HEAD OFF.

30:26.291 --> 30:28.041
- MASUKA, WE GOT SOME
BRAIN GOO ON THE CEILING

30:28.041 --> 30:29.458
YOU NEED TO PHOTOGRAPH.

30:29.458 --> 30:31.000
- OH, FUCK ME
UP THE GOAT ASS.

30:31.000 --> 30:34.917
- WHAT ABOUT ALL THAT
SANTA MUERTE STUFF THEN?

30:34.917 --> 30:37.083
- YEAH...THERE IS
NO SANTA MUERTE STUFF.

30:37.083 --> 30:38.959
- THAT'S WHAT I'M SAYING.
THERE WAS AT THE PARK.

30:38.959 --> 30:40.458
THERE WAS, UH, MISSING EYES
AND A TONGUE

30:40.458 --> 30:42.000
AND THE GOLD CANDLES
AND THE ICONS.

30:42.000 --> 30:45.458
THERE'S NONE OF THAT HERE.
- NO.

30:45.458 --> 30:47.500
- WHAT DO YOU THINK?

30:47.500 --> 30:49.083
- I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT.

30:49.083 --> 30:50.458
- WHO'S SHE?

30:53.375 --> 30:55.333
- [sighs]

30:55.333 --> 30:57.709
HEY...WHEN IS DEXTER
COMING BACK?

31:03.542 --> 31:06.125
- BOYD FOWLER WORKS
THE 7:00 TO 4:00 SHIFT...

31:06.125 --> 31:08.542
WHICH GIVES ME TIME
TO CHECK OUT HIS HOUSE,

31:08.542 --> 31:13.250
SEE IF THERE'S ANYTHING
THAT'LL PUT HIM ON MY TABLE.

31:13.250 --> 31:15.250
- LET ME GUESS.

31:15.250 --> 31:19.542
THIS IS YOU PUTTING ON
YOUR OXYGEN MASK FIRST.

31:19.542 --> 31:21.375
- BEING ON THE HUNT
KEEPS ME SHARP.

31:21.375 --> 31:23.125
FOCUSED.

31:23.125 --> 31:24.500
THUS, THE BETTER
KILLER I AM,

31:24.500 --> 31:25.917
THE BETTER FATHER.

31:50.709 --> 31:52.917
[flies buzzing]

31:56.208 --> 31:58.125
- SO HE TAKES HIS WORK
HOME WITH HIM.

31:58.125 --> 31:59.208
NO CRIME IN THAT.

32:11.583 --> 32:13.125
A MAN OF SIMPLE TASTE.

32:16.750 --> 32:18.417
LOOKS LIKE
MY GRANDMOTHER'S HOUSE.

32:22.417 --> 32:23.625
A LOADED HAND GUN.

32:23.625 --> 32:25.375
A NO-NO
FOR A CONVICTED FELON.

32:25.375 --> 32:27.083
BUT EVEN SO,
NOT MUCH TO GO ON.

32:28.667 --> 32:31.583
BOYD, YOU ARE VERY BORING.

32:36.750 --> 32:38.041
[whispers] SHIT.

32:39.500 --> 32:41.750
BOYD COMES HOME FOR LUNCH.

32:44.625 --> 32:46.625
OKAY, THAT'S INTERESTING.

32:46.625 --> 32:48.250
[door latch clicks]

32:53.166 --> 32:55.959
- [voice on CD] DO YOU WANT
T?

32:57.792 --> 32:59.959
YOU HAVE THAT POWER.

32:59.959 --> 33:03.000
YOU JUST HAVE TO LEARN
HOW TO USE IT.

33:03.000 --> 33:05.375
YOU CAN MAKE UP
ALL THE EXCUSES YOU WANT.

33:05.375 --> 33:07.750
YOU'RE TOO TIRED.

33:07.750 --> 33:09.834
- WHO KEEPS THEIR ATTIC DOOR
LOCKED?

33:09.834 --> 33:13.625
- TOO OLD.
TOO FAT.

33:13.625 --> 33:15.250
TOO STUPID.

33:15.250 --> 33:17.166
[chuckles] YOU KNOW,
I'VE HEARD THEM ALL.

33:17.166 --> 33:18.959
- CHICKEN NOODLE,
CHICKEN NOODLE, CHICKEN NOODLE.

33:18.959 --> 33:20.709
WHERE'S THE TOMATO?

33:20.709 --> 33:21.792
BUT IF YOU WANT SOMETHING...

33:21.792 --> 33:24.834
both: TAKE IT!

33:24.834 --> 33:27.000
- YOU WANT THAT JOB?

33:27.000 --> 33:29.375
both: WELL, THEN, TAKE IT!

33:29.375 --> 33:31.875
- IT'S ENTIRELY UP TO YOU.

33:31.875 --> 33:34.834
THE WORLD DOES NOT PUT ONE...
[cans clattering]

33:34.834 --> 33:37.250
YOU WANT THAT NICE HOUSE
ON THE BEACH?

33:37.250 --> 33:39.834
both: TAKE IT!

33:39.834 --> 33:41.333
- THE WORLD
DOES NOT PUT LIMITATIONS

33:41.333 --> 33:42.834
ON WHAT YOU CAN HAVE.

33:42.834 --> 33:44.750
BUT IF YOU WANT SOMETHING...

33:44.750 --> 33:46.000
both: TAKE IT!

33:46.000 --> 33:47.667
- YOU HAVE THAT POWER.

33:47.667 --> 33:49.000
- I CAN SEE HAVING

33:49.000 --> 33:52.667
AN OLD GIRLFRIEND'S
LOCK OF HAIR...

33:52.667 --> 33:54.667
BUT IDENTIFIED
ONLY BY A NUMBER?

33:54.667 --> 33:57.792
- WE ARE OUR OWN WORST ENEMY.

33:57.792 --> 33:59.375
MAKE NO MISTAKE ABOUT IT.

33:59.375 --> 34:01.291
BUT WITH A FEW
SIMPLE STEPS,

34:01.291 --> 34:05.166
I CAN TEACH YOU HOW TO TAKE
CONTROL OF YOUR LIFE.

34:05.166 --> 34:06.542
TAKE IT!

34:06.542 --> 34:08.375
- ALL I'M SAYING...

34:08.375 --> 34:10.041
IF A WOMAN
PISSED ME OFF ENOUGH,

34:10.041 --> 34:11.834
YEAH, I'D WANNA
CUT HER HEAD OFF.

34:11.834 --> 34:12.959
- WELL, THAT'S
GREAT TO HEAR.

34:12.959 --> 34:14.875
- NO, I'M NOT SAYING
I WOULD DO IT.

34:14.875 --> 34:17.041
BUT I UNDERSTAND THE IMPULSE.

34:17.041 --> 34:18.375
WHAT ARE WE DOING HERE?

34:18.375 --> 34:20.750
- I TOLD DEXTER I'D
CHECK THIS PLACE OUT FOR HIM.

34:23.625 --> 34:25.667
- OH! COME IN, COME IN.

34:25.667 --> 34:26.709
- HEY.
- HI!

34:26.709 --> 34:28.291
UM, WE'VE JUST PAINTED

34:28.291 --> 34:30.709
AND INSTALLED NEW FLOORING
THROUGHOUT THE HOUSE.

34:30.709 --> 34:32.542
- LOOKS GREAT.
- [squeals]

34:32.542 --> 34:34.417

45:50.375 --> 45:52.375
DON'T WORRY, WE'LL STILL
SEE EACH OTHER ALL THE TIME.

45:52.375 --> 45:54.417
ORLANDO'S NOT SO FAR.

45:54.417 --> 45:56.000
- [sniffles]

45:56.000 --> 45:57.583
YES, IT IS.

45:57.583 --> 45:58.750
- ANY SHRINK COULD TELL YOU

45:58.750 --> 46:00.250
THAT'S WHY I'VE ALWAYS
LIKED CHILDREN.

46:00.250 --> 46:04.625
BECAUSE THEY CONNECT ME
TO WHAT I CAN NEVER GET BACK.

46:04.625 --> 46:07.041
- I DON'T WANT TO GO, DEXTER.

46:09.917 --> 46:11.375
- I DOT WANT YOU TO GO.

46:22.333 --> 46:25.083
ASTOR...

46:25.083 --> 46:27.041
- WHAT?

46:31.166 --> 46:35.542
- YOUR MOTHER LOVED YOU MORE
THAN YOU COULD EVER IMAGINE.

46:35.542 --> 46:37.417
AND I...

46:42.458 --> 46:44.917
ME TOO.

46:54.667 --> 46:56.917
[engine starts]

47:11.417 --> 47:12.875
- CODY AND ASTOR SHOWED ME

47:12.875 --> 47:16.166
THAT I CAN STILL CARE
ABOUT SOMETHING.

47:16.166 --> 47:18.959
THAT MAKES LETTING THEM GO
ALL THAT MUCH HARDER.

47:34.208 --> 47:36.166
AND IT'S LOSING THEM
THAT MAKES ME REALIZE

47:36.166 --> 47:38.834
THERE MUST BE SOME SMALL PART
OF THAT INNOCENT CHILD

47:38.834 --> 47:41.875
STILL INSIDE ME.

47:41.875 --> 47:43.291
[scissors snip]

47:49.250 --> 47:50.375
BECAUSE, JUST LIKE ASTOR,

47:50.375 --> 47:52.250
I WAS FOOLISH ENOUGH
TO THINK THAT THINGS

47:52.250 --> 47:55.250
WOULD ALWAYS BE GOOD.

47:55.250 --> 47:56.333
BUT THEY'RE NOT.

48:06.834 --> 48:09.041
THEY'RE WORSE.

48:15.375 --> 48:18.542
[sizzling]

48:18.542 --> 48:21.375
MUCH WORSE.

48:21.375 --> 48:24.875
NORMALLY, HAVING A TARGET
WOULD MAKE ME FEEL GOOD.

48:24.875 --> 48:26.500
GIVE ME DIRECTION.

48:26.500 --> 48:27.709
A SENSE OF PURPOSE.

48:27.709 --> 48:29.000
BUT NOW...

48:34.125 --> 48:36.333
IT MEANS NOTHING.

48:36.333 --> 48:41.583
AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S
GOING TO MAKE ME FEEL BETTER.

48:41.583 --> 48:44.875
- SHOULD WE GO HOME?

48:44.875 --> 48:47.417
- GIVE ME A MINUTE.

48:47.417 --> 48:51.583
