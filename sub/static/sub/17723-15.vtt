Dads <i>is recorded in front</i>
<i>of a live studio audience.</i>

00:19.987 --> 00:22.187
Somebody left an application
for <i>So You Think You Can Dance</i>

00:22.189 --> 00:23.555
on the printer?

00:23.557 --> 00:25.057
Not me.

00:25.059 --> 00:27.226
Mine.

00:27.228 --> 00:28.027
You can dance?

00:28.029 --> 00:31.196
I think I can.

00:31.198 --> 00:32.431
Show me.

00:40.707 --> 00:42.207
No, you can't.

00:42.209 --> 00:44.043
Surprise!

00:44.045 --> 00:45.244
Hey, honey!
What are you doing here?

00:45.246 --> 00:47.513
Uh, I've got some bad news.

00:47.515 --> 00:49.214
I just talked to my sister.

00:49.216 --> 00:51.050
And she's going
through a rough patch.

00:51.052 --> 00:52.851
Oh.
Oh, no!
What's happening?

00:52.853 --> 00:54.553
And tell him the long
version, thanks.

00:56.423 --> 00:59.425
Well, things are a little rocky
with Joaquin.

00:59.427 --> 01:00.692
Oh, why?

01:00.694 --> 01:04.163
Did she "Joaquin" on him
with another woman?

01:05.098 --> 01:07.533
And her

01:07.535 --> 01:10.269
ceramics business hit
just a bit of a snag.

01:10.271 --> 01:11.270
Aw, that's so weird.

01:11.272 --> 01:13.238
I heard she
was "kiln it."

01:13.240 --> 01:16.008
(laughing)

01:18.845 --> 01:21.513
Oh, I love when he does
that with words.

01:21.515 --> 01:23.182
Oh...

01:23.184 --> 01:24.850
your sister.

01:24.852 --> 01:27.119
Yes, my sister.
Yeah. Mm-hmm.

01:27.121 --> 01:29.254
Uh, she needs me right now,
so is it okay

01:29.256 --> 01:31.123
if I just go visit her
for a few days?

01:31.125 --> 01:32.291
Uh, and the kids are gonna be...

01:32.293 --> 01:33.625
They'll come with me.

01:33.627 --> 01:35.260
Is that okay?
Yeah, yeah.

01:35.262 --> 01:37.196
Well, you know, you need
to be there for your sister.

01:37.198 --> 01:38.864
As do the kids.

01:38.866 --> 01:40.299
Thanks for understanding.
Okay, yeah.

01:40.301 --> 01:42.101
I'll call you when I get there.
Yeah.

01:42.103 --> 01:45.204
All right.
BOTH:
Nubbins, nubbins,
nubbins, nubbins, nubbins

01:45.206 --> 01:46.638
I'll miss you.
All right, I'll miss you.

01:46.640 --> 01:48.073
I miss you already.

01:48.075 --> 01:49.308
All right, I love you.

01:49.310 --> 01:51.143
I love you.

01:51.145 --> 01:54.913
Yeah! Yeah!

01:54.915 --> 01:57.082
First time alone in five years!

01:57.084 --> 01:58.784
(whoops) Yeah!

01:58.786 --> 02:00.385
Yeah!

02:00.387 --> 02:02.855
Yeah!
Yeah!

02:04.591 --> 02:05.891
See that, n...
Yeah!

02:05.893 --> 02:07.226
Now he can dance!

02:07.228 --> 02:09.528
Yeah! Yeah!
Yeah! Yeah!

02:11.231 --> 02:14.333
¶ Daddy took me to the zoo

02:14.335 --> 02:16.135
¶ <i>Na, na, na, na</i> ¶

02:16.137 --> 02:20.172
¶ Just to see
something brand-new ¶

02:20.174 --> 02:22.241
¶ <i>Na, na, na</i> ¶

02:22.243 --> 02:26.311
¶ So many stars up in the sky

02:26.313 --> 02:31.016
¶ So many questions have I

02:31.018 --> 02:33.185
¶ <i>Na, na, na, na</i> ¶

02:33.187 --> 02:35.587
¶ Daddy took me for a ride.

02:38.758 --> 02:40.592
Yeah, no wife!

02:40.594 --> 02:42.027
No kids!

02:42.029 --> 02:44.496
Yeah, yeah!

02:44.498 --> 02:47.332
Oh, God, what do I do, Eli?
What do I do?

02:47.334 --> 02:49.134
First time
I'm home alone in-in years.

02:49.136 --> 02:50.335
I don't know what to do.

02:50.337 --> 02:51.436
Oh, my gosh.

02:51.438 --> 02:54.139
You can, you can, you can do
whatever you want.

02:54.141 --> 02:56.975
Yeah!
Alcohol, video games,
pornography.

02:56.977 --> 02:58.377
Pornography.

02:58.379 --> 02:59.778
Yeah.

02:59.780 --> 03:02.181
Yeah, you got
any DVDs I could borrow?

03:02.183 --> 03:05.350
DVDs?
Yeah.

03:05.352 --> 03:06.351
Here, uh, this flash drive

03:06.353 --> 03:07.986
has every porn ever made

03:07.988 --> 03:09.588
up until this morning.

03:12.358 --> 03:13.725
Hey, Warner?
Yeah.

03:13.727 --> 03:15.527
I heard Camila's gonna be
out of town.

03:15.529 --> 03:16.728
So I guess

03:16.730 --> 03:17.996
it's just the two of us, huh?

03:17.998 --> 03:20.299
When the cat's away.
(laughs)

03:20.301 --> 03:21.466
Uh-huh.

03:21.468 --> 03:24.736
By the way, the cat ran away
this morning.

03:24.738 --> 03:26.205
No.

03:26.207 --> 03:28.207
No, no, no, no, no, no.
You know what?

03:28.209 --> 03:30.042
You know, this is
my week home alone.

03:30.044 --> 03:31.376
So, you know,
you-you take this money.

03:31.378 --> 03:33.045
And you go to a hotel.

03:33.047 --> 03:34.680
Yeah!
All right.

03:34.682 --> 03:36.748
Okay.

03:38.251 --> 03:40.219
What? Wait a minute.
That works?

03:40.221 --> 03:42.254
Hold, hold... hey, hey,
uh, Dad, Dad, Dad ?

03:42.256 --> 03:45.657
You will go to a hotel.

03:48.394 --> 03:51.263
I will go to a hotel.

03:52.432 --> 03:56.235
And you will not come back.

03:56.237 --> 03:59.104
Oh, yes, I will.

03:59.106 --> 04:00.672
Mm-wah!
(groans)

04:02.375 --> 04:04.443
All right, listen up.

04:04.445 --> 04:06.111
We are going to act

04:06.113 --> 04:08.413
like a couple
of corporate hotshots

04:08.415 --> 04:10.249
and get a ton of free perks.

04:10.251 --> 04:11.416
Follow my lead.

04:11.418 --> 04:12.417
Hi.

04:12.419 --> 04:13.885
Hello.

04:13.887 --> 04:16.455
I am Crawford Whittemore.

04:16.457 --> 04:18.690
Vice president
of Whittemore Industries.

04:18.692 --> 04:22.227
And this is my longtime partner,

04:22.229 --> 04:25.230
David Sachs.

04:25.232 --> 04:27.232
Your partner?
Mm-hmm.

04:27.234 --> 04:29.301
We've known each
other 30 years.

04:29.303 --> 04:30.302
30 years?

04:30.304 --> 04:31.803
Wow!
Yup.

04:31.805 --> 04:33.405
You two are an inspiration.

04:33.407 --> 04:35.641
And I will bend over forward
to make sure

04:35.643 --> 04:38.310
you get everything you need.

04:38.312 --> 04:41.747
Don't you mean backward?

04:41.749 --> 04:44.283
No.

04:44.285 --> 04:47.319
Well, we just want to get on
up to the room,

04:47.321 --> 04:49.288
hang that "Do Not Disturb" sign
on the door,

04:49.290 --> 04:52.491
and get right down to business.

04:52.493 --> 04:54.459
Yes, sir.

04:59.399 --> 05:01.300
Wow! You believe
this place?

05:01.302 --> 05:03.135
A Jacuzzi tub,
a canopy bed.

05:03.137 --> 05:05.304
Where's your bed?

05:05.306 --> 05:07.272
It has a full wet bar.

05:07.274 --> 05:09.408
Where's your bed?

05:09.410 --> 05:12.177
Got a gift basket
of-of condoms.

05:12.179 --> 05:15.480
Where's your bed?

05:15.482 --> 05:17.349
"Jeb Rodrigo's

05:17.351 --> 05:20.252
Gentlemen's Lubricant."

05:22.455 --> 05:24.456
They think we're gay.

05:24.458 --> 05:27.959
What could possibly have
given them that idea?

05:27.961 --> 05:30.796
You told them we were longtime
partners who wanted
Yeah?

05:30.798 --> 05:34.166
to rush up to the room
and get down to business.

05:34.168 --> 05:36.001
MAN:
Knock, knock.

05:36.003 --> 05:38.370
Complimentary caviar
and champagne

05:38.372 --> 05:41.273
for our VIGPs.

05:42.809 --> 05:45.677
Oh, the "G" stands for "gay."

05:47.714 --> 05:50.716
Oh, my God.

05:50.718 --> 05:52.551
Ooh. (chuckles)

05:52.553 --> 05:55.287
This gay lifestyle really
melts in your mouth.

06:00.226 --> 06:01.360
Well, it is pretty nice.

06:01.362 --> 06:05.130
Well, what do
you say, partner?

06:05.132 --> 06:07.232
"Free couples massage."

06:07.234 --> 06:09.368
Well, as gay men must say a lot,

06:09.370 --> 06:11.103
I'm in.

06:12.572 --> 06:13.805
All right, well,
the first thing you do

06:13.807 --> 06:15.140
when your wife
is out of town,

06:15.142 --> 06:17.242
you look up
old girlfriends on Facebook.

06:19.846 --> 06:21.747
Why would I want to see what
old girlfriends are doing

06:21.749 --> 06:23.248
if I'm a happily married man?

06:23.250 --> 06:24.149
'Cause it's fun.

06:24.151 --> 06:25.550
You can see if they got fat.

06:25.552 --> 06:28.887
Or if they married
people that are fat.

06:30.556 --> 06:32.190
You know,
or if they had kids...

06:32.192 --> 06:34.192
that are fat.

06:34.194 --> 06:36.528
I don't care...
(groaning)

06:36.530 --> 06:37.929
I don't know, no.

06:37.931 --> 06:39.030
Come on, come on!

06:39.032 --> 06:42.000
Let's look up,
uh, Judy Stone.

06:42.002 --> 06:43.201
Oh, my God!

06:43.203 --> 06:45.270
She shot herself in 2008.

06:46.539 --> 06:48.607
(gasps)

06:48.609 --> 06:50.776
The chicken stew!

06:50.778 --> 06:53.245
It have message for Mr. Warner.

06:53.247 --> 06:55.280
No, Edna, no.

06:55.282 --> 06:57.249
Not this again.

06:57.251 --> 06:58.884
(laughing): What?

06:58.886 --> 07:01.787
Edna reads the chicken bones
in her stew.

07:01.789 --> 07:05.323
And she thinks that it can
predict the future.

07:07.093 --> 07:09.461
Well, has it ever been right?

07:09.463 --> 07:12.297
Chicken stew predict 9-11.

07:12.299 --> 07:15.934
No one listen
when I call Pentagon.

07:19.572 --> 07:22.441
Well, what does it say about me?

07:22.443 --> 07:25.477
This chicken stew say
three things.

07:25.479 --> 07:28.613
Oh, that is some
chatty stew.

07:28.615 --> 07:32.617
Number one--
you get something for nothing.

07:32.619 --> 07:36.421
Come on!
That is pretty generic.

07:36.423 --> 07:38.490
Number two--

07:38.492 --> 07:42.260
a redhead will ruin your life.

07:42.262 --> 07:46.264
Oh, my God,
it's already coming true.

07:46.266 --> 07:48.567
Sorry.

07:48.569 --> 07:52.204
You make baby
with your father's face.

07:58.077 --> 08:01.179
I'm gonna make a baby
with my father's face?

08:04.684 --> 08:07.452
What does that even mean?

08:07.454 --> 08:09.154
Chicken stew say,

08:09.156 --> 08:11.223
"This interview over."

08:20.333 --> 08:21.600
(gunfire on video game)

08:21.602 --> 08:23.335
Yeah! Yeah!

08:23.337 --> 08:24.870
I shot you in the throat!

08:24.872 --> 08:26.104
Yeah, why don't you cry

08:26.106 --> 08:27.639
about it, stupid bitch?

08:27.641 --> 08:30.509
Oh! Oh, why don't you get
your mommy?

08:30.511 --> 08:33.111
Ooh, yeah! Yeah.

08:33.113 --> 08:34.679
Oh, no, don't-don't-d-don't...

08:34.681 --> 08:35.847
Hi, ma'am.

08:37.350 --> 08:41.119
No, I'm s...
I-I-I didn't know he was eight.

08:41.121 --> 08:43.989
Well-well, I'm only nine.
(doorbell rings)

08:43.991 --> 08:45.490
It's open!

08:45.492 --> 08:46.992
BOTH: Hey, oh!
Hey!

08:46.994 --> 08:50.328
This place looks great!
This place looks disgusting.

08:50.330 --> 08:51.396
Warner, it's Tuesday.

08:51.398 --> 08:52.731
Even though
your family's gone,

08:52.733 --> 08:54.132
you still have
to come to work.

08:54.134 --> 08:56.134
Honestly, I forgot I had a job.
(Eli laughs)

08:56.136 --> 08:58.336
Here, this was in
the driveway.

08:58.338 --> 08:59.905
Oh, I don't subscribe
to the newspaper.

08:59.907 --> 09:01.172
(gasps)
Oh, my God!

09:01.174 --> 09:02.173
What?

09:02.175 --> 09:03.875
"You'll get
something for nothing."

09:03.877 --> 09:05.377
Edna's prediction came true.

09:05.379 --> 09:06.511
No...
Yes!

09:06.513 --> 09:09.147
What are you talking about?

09:09.149 --> 09:13.084
Edna has a chicken stew that she
thinks can predict the future.

09:13.086 --> 09:14.386
I know that stew.

09:14.388 --> 09:16.388
It once told me I was
gonna cause a car accident.

09:16.390 --> 09:17.656
And then I did.

09:19.025 --> 09:20.759
I don't think
your horrible driving

09:20.761 --> 09:22.761
has anything to do
with the stew.

09:22.763 --> 09:24.763
(computer dings)

09:24.765 --> 09:27.198
Oh, you got onto Facebook.
All right.

09:27.200 --> 09:28.600
Yeah, you know,
I had a question.

09:28.602 --> 09:31.603
Does everyone have to post
pictures of everything they eat?

09:31.605 --> 09:33.171
Yeah.

09:33.173 --> 09:34.172
(computer dings)

09:34.174 --> 09:35.240
Who's Maria?

09:35.242 --> 09:36.608
She keeps poking you.

09:36.610 --> 09:39.044
Oh, Maria?
Your crazy ex Maria?

09:39.046 --> 09:41.780
Yeah... she-she posted a picture
of a, of a cranberry muffin

09:41.782 --> 09:44.115
that looked good,
so, you know, I "liked" it.

09:44.117 --> 09:46.418
And then, uh, 14 pokes later,
here we are.

09:46.420 --> 09:50.188
By-by-by the way,
what does poke mean?

09:50.190 --> 09:52.257
Uh, how can
I explain that?

09:52.259 --> 09:54.759
If a guy pokes another
guy, then it's like,

09:54.761 --> 09:56.628
"Hey, how are you?"

09:56.630 --> 10:00.198
And if a girl pokes
a guy, it's like...

10:00.200 --> 10:02.200
(British accent):
"Oh, you fancy a cranberry
muffin, sir?"

10:05.237 --> 10:07.305
(both moaning)

10:10.142 --> 10:12.077
Forget about shiatsu.

10:12.079 --> 10:15.080
I'll take he-atsu any day.

10:15.082 --> 10:17.082
I've never been so relaxed.

10:17.084 --> 10:19.884
Sorry about those farts.

10:19.886 --> 10:22.587
Sir, that's a compliment.

10:22.589 --> 10:24.990
Like an Arab burping
after a meal.

10:24.992 --> 10:26.791
Speaking of which,
your complimentary breakfast

10:26.793 --> 10:28.159
will be here shortly.

10:28.161 --> 10:29.728
But we didn't order it.

10:29.730 --> 10:30.762
Oh, I did.

10:30.764 --> 10:31.997
Well, that's stupid.

10:31.999 --> 10:33.999
It'll be cold
by the time we're done.

10:34.001 --> 10:36.301
Why do you always find fault
with everything I do?

10:36.303 --> 10:39.170
Because you're wrong
all the time.

10:39.172 --> 10:40.839
Like when?

10:40.841 --> 10:42.407
Like the movie
you picked last night.

10:42.409 --> 10:44.676
I'm an adult staying at a hotel.

10:44.678 --> 10:47.779
I don't want to watch <i>Rango.</i>

10:47.781 --> 10:49.914
Marriage, huh?

10:49.916 --> 10:51.182
What?

10:51.184 --> 10:53.652
Married...? No, no, no.
We're not marr...

10:53.654 --> 10:54.753
(mumbling)
Uh...

10:54.755 --> 10:56.121
Oh, uh, sorry, honey.

10:56.123 --> 10:58.089
That's all right.

10:58.091 --> 10:59.691
(laughs)

10:59.693 --> 11:02.027
Hmm, well, look who's back.
I'm not back.

11:02.029 --> 11:04.095
I'm just getting
pretzel rods.

11:05.998 --> 11:07.432
Oh, hi.

11:07.434 --> 11:08.833
Can I help you?
I'm actually looking for...

11:08.835 --> 11:11.436
Warner! (laughs)

11:11.438 --> 11:12.871
Maria.

11:12.873 --> 11:15.106
Oh, my God, I thought
you lived in Boston.

11:15.108 --> 11:17.342
Why-why are you here?

11:17.344 --> 11:19.010
Uh, honestly, you.

11:19.012 --> 11:20.512
I was so excited
that you liked

11:20.514 --> 11:22.747
my cranberry muffin,
I thought I'd bring you one.

11:24.050 --> 11:28.019
You flew, you flew 3,000 miles
to give me a muffin?

11:28.021 --> 11:29.654
Actually, I flew 2,000.

11:29.656 --> 11:32.023
The last thousand I hitchhiked.

11:32.025 --> 11:34.859
God, that sounds dangerous.
(laughs)

11:34.861 --> 11:36.695
It... it is.

11:37.963 --> 11:40.965
So, are you free
for dinner tonight?

11:40.967 --> 11:43.501
Oh, no, uh...

11:43.503 --> 11:45.236
No, I-I can't, you know?

11:45.238 --> 11:47.572
I got the, uh, I got my house
to myself tonight.

11:47.574 --> 11:50.308
And I was gonna, I was gonna go
home and-and look at pictures

11:50.310 --> 11:51.976
of my beautiful wife

11:51.978 --> 11:53.845
and kids.

11:53.847 --> 11:57.248
And then turn in
at, like, 4:00 p.m.

11:57.250 --> 11:58.583
That's perfect.

11:58.585 --> 12:00.752
I know where you live.

12:01.987 --> 12:04.589
I'll come by and take pictures
of you eating my muffin.

12:04.591 --> 12:06.891
Then you'll post it on Facebook,
and I'll like it.

12:06.893 --> 12:10.161
Then I'll take a picture of you
liking it, I'll post that,

12:10.163 --> 12:11.896
we'll tag each other,
and then boom!

12:11.898 --> 12:15.500
60 likes, minimum!

12:15.502 --> 12:17.936
Oh, my God, it's' so amazing!

12:17.938 --> 12:19.537
(laughing nervously):
Oh, my God.

12:19.539 --> 12:21.272
Eli, help me.

12:21.274 --> 12:23.608
Uh, hey, hey, hey.

12:23.610 --> 12:24.909
Maria?
Huh?

12:24.911 --> 12:27.212
Hey, there's no need for
you to go to his house.

12:27.214 --> 12:29.280
Ever. (laughs)

12:30.549 --> 12:31.950
Yeah, maybe you should
go to a restaurant.

12:31.952 --> 12:35.854
Where there's witnesses
and security cameras.

12:35.856 --> 12:37.922
How's 8:00 sound?
Oh, great.

12:37.924 --> 12:38.790
Great!

12:38.792 --> 12:40.925
8:00.

12:40.927 --> 12:43.027
I don't want your muffin.
(laughs)

12:43.029 --> 12:45.864
Okay.

12:47.099 --> 12:50.368
I can't believe all
the free stuff we keep getting.

12:50.370 --> 12:52.403
I know. No wonder
so many people

12:52.405 --> 12:55.039
choose to be gay.

12:58.944 --> 13:00.645
Oh, wow.

13:00.647 --> 13:04.282
I'd like to bite down on that
and have it drag me to death.

13:06.819 --> 13:08.987
We have a problem.

13:08.989 --> 13:11.890
Those two aren't gay.

13:11.892 --> 13:13.825
Yeah, I think you're right.

13:13.827 --> 13:16.828
I used all my finger
powers on them.

13:16.830 --> 13:18.163
Even gave them

13:18.165 --> 13:22.000
my patented
inner thigh mash.

13:22.002 --> 13:24.869
Nothing.

13:25.805 --> 13:27.138
Bar's closed,

13:27.140 --> 13:29.207
faux-mos.

13:30.176 --> 13:32.443
We're not faux-mos.
Yeah.

13:32.445 --> 13:35.880
We're on
our homosexual honeymoon.

13:37.616 --> 13:40.151
Shh. Don't tell God.

13:41.987 --> 13:43.922
I can't wait for everyone
to see my coleslaw.

13:43.924 --> 13:46.658
It's gonna blow up.

13:46.660 --> 13:49.661
Do you guys mind if I have a
few minutes alone with Warner?

13:49.663 --> 13:51.162
Alone? No.

13:51.164 --> 13:53.598
I-I think we should cherish
this moment with friends.

13:53.600 --> 13:55.633
Oh sure, we can go
make out in the car, right?

13:55.635 --> 13:56.835
Yeah, if we're
in a closed garage

13:56.837 --> 13:58.169
and the engine is running.
Ooh.

13:58.171 --> 14:00.104
Wait, please stay?

14:00.106 --> 14:01.606
Be right back.

14:01.608 --> 14:03.875
Waiter, could I... uh,
would you like to join us?

14:03.877 --> 14:05.043
Warner?
Yeah, yeah.

14:05.045 --> 14:07.045
There's something
that I need

14:07.047 --> 14:09.047
to talk to you about.

14:09.049 --> 14:11.182
I didn't realize
when we were dating,

14:11.184 --> 14:13.218
but you were the best man
I'd ever meet.

14:13.220 --> 14:15.987
Life hasn't gone the way
that I thought it would.

14:15.989 --> 14:18.056
I'm almost 40, still single.

14:18.058 --> 14:19.524
All the guys I dated were jerks.

14:19.526 --> 14:21.626
Except for you.

14:21.628 --> 14:22.727
You are the kindest,

14:22.729 --> 14:24.295
most ethical person
I've ever met.

14:25.531 --> 14:27.232
Okay, I'm a, I'm a happily,

14:27.234 --> 14:30.034
happily, happily...

14:30.036 --> 14:31.002
Oh, I don't want you
to leave your wife.

14:31.004 --> 14:33.071
You don't? 'Cause phew.

14:33.073 --> 14:34.405
(laughs)

14:34.407 --> 14:38.076
I just want to have a baby,
and I need some of your sperm.

14:38.078 --> 14:39.677
What?

14:39.679 --> 14:43.014
What did she say, Howard?
I'm not wearing my hearing aid.

14:43.016 --> 14:45.083
Sperm!

14:47.920 --> 14:52.090
Maria, I'm not, I'm not gonna
have intercourse with you.

14:52.092 --> 14:53.324
Oh, no, no, no!
Nothing like that.

14:53.326 --> 14:55.426
I-I know how much
you love your family.

14:55.428 --> 14:57.061
And I just want
the same for myself.

14:57.063 --> 14:59.097
You'll never see the child.

14:59.099 --> 15:00.231
No one will ever find out.

15:00.233 --> 15:02.233
No, I-I can't. No.

15:02.235 --> 15:03.434
I am not leaving this city

15:03.436 --> 15:05.503
without drops of you
in my purse.

15:09.108 --> 15:11.042
You make baby

15:11.044 --> 15:13.311
with your father's face.

15:15.714 --> 15:19.083
Hey, nice restaurant!

15:26.525 --> 15:28.593
You said yes?!

15:31.130 --> 15:33.031
Well, what else
was I supposed to say?

15:33.033 --> 15:36.301
No!

15:36.303 --> 15:38.937
Eli, she's crazy and she was
doing the crazy person cry.

15:38.939 --> 15:40.104
With the eyes...

15:40.106 --> 15:42.273
Ew.

15:42.275 --> 15:44.108
Yeah, no, I just wanted
to end the conversation.

15:44.110 --> 15:47.412
Which is actually sort of the
same reason why I got engaged.

15:47.414 --> 15:50.715
Edna, what does
the chicken say?

15:50.717 --> 15:53.151
It say, "Cluck, cluck."

15:54.620 --> 15:56.988
Sometimes chicken

15:56.990 --> 15:59.090
just chicken.

15:59.092 --> 16:02.293
Eli, what am I gonna do?

16:02.295 --> 16:05.096
She said she's not leaving
town unless she has it.

16:05.098 --> 16:07.231
And she definitely
can't be here

16:07.233 --> 16:08.833
when my wife gets back.

16:08.835 --> 16:10.868
This is your fault.
You got to help me out.

16:12.438 --> 16:13.972
I got it!

16:13.974 --> 16:15.974
When is sperm

16:15.976 --> 16:19.010
not sperm?

16:25.517 --> 16:26.751
When?

16:26.753 --> 16:30.655
When it's not sperm.

16:30.657 --> 16:33.191
Okay, so why did you
pose the question

16:33.193 --> 16:36.160
like it's an exciting riddle?

16:36.162 --> 16:38.196
No, you're right. Let's just
say everything in life

16:38.198 --> 16:40.198
in the most boring way possible!

16:41.800 --> 16:43.634
Mr. Eli?

16:43.636 --> 16:47.171
What is a sperm?

16:47.173 --> 16:49.640
It's the, it's the liquid

16:49.642 --> 16:52.343
that made all your babies.

16:52.345 --> 16:53.444
Oh.

16:53.446 --> 16:55.513
Tequila.

17:03.355 --> 17:05.656
Oh, for Pete's sake.
Look at this!

17:05.658 --> 17:07.191
They're charging us
for all those perks.

17:07.193 --> 17:09.460
We can't pay this.

17:09.462 --> 17:11.829
How'd they figure out
we're straight?

17:11.831 --> 17:13.898
I can't believe
we were "inned."

17:15.801 --> 17:18.503
Okay, there is still
one thing we can do.

17:18.505 --> 17:21.005
What are you doing?
They're coming around

17:21.007 --> 17:22.573
with their turndown service...

17:22.575 --> 17:24.075
Yeah?

17:24.077 --> 17:26.377
...and we, my friend,
are gonna convince them

17:26.379 --> 17:27.678
that we are gay, okay?

17:27.680 --> 17:31.416
Follow my lead.
(clears throat)

17:31.418 --> 17:33.251
Oh! Look at that

17:33.253 --> 17:36.254
65-year-old penis!

17:36.256 --> 17:38.923
I am enjoying
your gay touch!

17:38.925 --> 17:41.192
Oh, yes!

17:41.194 --> 17:44.862
Your droopy butt
is my paradise!

17:44.864 --> 17:46.097
Oh, oh...

17:46.099 --> 17:47.598
Why aren't you
saying anything?

17:47.600 --> 17:49.500
This is what I do
during sex.

17:49.502 --> 17:51.102
Stare coldly in the distance

17:51.104 --> 17:53.104
and think of Wonder Woman.

17:53.106 --> 17:54.405
Look...

17:54.407 --> 17:57.308
do you want to pay
the 750 bucks?

17:58.410 --> 18:00.178
Touch my butt!

18:00.180 --> 18:02.113
Just a little bit
to the left.

18:02.115 --> 18:03.281
Oh, yes!
Yeah, let's keep having sex!

18:03.283 --> 18:04.916
That's just the way I like it!
No girls allowed!

18:04.918 --> 18:07.685
Penis style! Oh, oh!
Yes, yes, yes!

18:07.687 --> 18:10.054
Oh! Oh! Oh!
Yes! Yes! Yes!

18:10.056 --> 18:12.924
Yes! Yes...
Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh!

18:12.926 --> 18:15.259
Uh-oh!

18:20.566 --> 18:23.101
You really think
we can fool her

18:23.103 --> 18:25.269
by making fake sperm?

18:25.271 --> 18:27.105
Yeah, why not?

18:27.107 --> 18:28.639
Eli, this is stupid.

18:28.641 --> 18:30.074
I don't want to do this.

18:30.076 --> 18:32.310
Okay, well, in that case,

18:32.312 --> 18:33.778
then you can tell Camila
you agreed

18:33.780 --> 18:36.147
to give your ex-girlfriend
your sperm.

18:38.951 --> 18:41.152
We can make fake sperm, yeah.
We can make fake sperm.

18:41.154 --> 18:42.553
¶

18:42.555 --> 18:44.388
¶ Ooh

18:44.390 --> 18:47.125
¶ Weird science

18:47.127 --> 18:48.493
¶ Plastic tubes
and pots and pans ¶

18:48.495 --> 18:51.229
¶ Bits and pieces
and the magic from the hand ¶

18:51.231 --> 18:53.164
¶ We're making weird science

18:53.166 --> 18:56.234
¶ Things I've never
seen before ¶

18:56.236 --> 18:58.302
¶ Behind bolted doors, talent

18:58.304 --> 19:01.572
¶ And imagination,
weird science ¶

19:01.574 --> 19:04.142
¶ Not what teacher said to do

19:04.144 --> 19:07.011
¶ Making dreams come true,
living tissue, warm flesh ¶

19:07.013 --> 19:09.514
¶ Weird science, ooh

19:09.516 --> 19:12.150
¶ Plastic tubes and pots
and pans, bits and pieces ¶

19:12.152 --> 19:15.253
¶ And bits and pieces
and my creation ¶

19:15.255 --> 19:17.355
¶ Is it real?

19:17.357 --> 19:19.824
¶ It's my creation, ooh

19:19.826 --> 19:24.195
¶ My creation,
it's my creation ¶

19:28.367 --> 19:30.168

20:00.232 --> 20:01.732
Ah! Thank God you're here.
Hey.

20:01.734 --> 20:03.401
I was afraid you
changed your mind.

20:03.403 --> 20:05.203
Oh, no, I was just, uh,

20:05.205 --> 20:07.305
actually taking
extra time to pick out

20:07.307 --> 20:10.841
all the best little sperms.

20:10.843 --> 20:12.310
Why are you here?

20:12.312 --> 20:13.878
It's my cooler.

20:15.214 --> 20:16.814
This is so incredible of you.

20:16.816 --> 20:18.749
You're one of a kind, Warner.

20:18.751 --> 20:20.318
Yeah, they broke the mold.

20:20.320 --> 20:22.220
Broke that mold.
Ow.

20:22.222 --> 20:23.354
I want to use the mold!

20:23.356 --> 20:25.423
Well, you can't.
Too bad. It's broken.

20:25.425 --> 20:27.391
Thank you, Warner.

20:27.393 --> 20:30.228
I can't wait till this grows
into a beautiful man.

20:30.230 --> 20:31.729
Just like his papa.

20:33.232 --> 20:36.434
It'll be worth the painful and
expensive insemination process.

20:36.436 --> 20:38.502
And the horrible thing
that happened

20:38.504 --> 20:41.272
to me hitchhiking
on the way here.

20:42.274 --> 20:43.341
You know what?
I'm so...

20:43.343 --> 20:44.408
I'm-I'm so sorry.

20:44.410 --> 20:45.910
I'm so sorry. I-I-I...

20:45.912 --> 20:47.878
I can't let you do this.

20:47.880 --> 20:49.413
What? Why?

20:49.415 --> 20:50.715
No, just trust me.
Y-You need to give it back.

20:50.717 --> 20:52.216
No, you're
just having cold feet.

20:52.218 --> 20:53.284
Okay, I'm sorry,
I-I can't let you do this.

20:53.286 --> 20:54.585
You-you got to give it back.

20:54.587 --> 20:56.887
No seriously, give it back.
Give it back.
Stop. No, no!

20:56.889 --> 20:59.223
You know, it's flattering
that people even thought

20:59.225 --> 21:01.592
I could get a guy like you.

21:01.594 --> 21:04.028
Don't sell yourself short.

21:04.030 --> 21:07.431
You've got great legs and
gorgeous chestnut eyes.

21:07.433 --> 21:10.601
They're blue.

21:10.603 --> 21:12.703
Don't ruin the moment.

21:12.705 --> 21:14.305
(elevator bell dings)

21:14.307 --> 21:15.439
(both grunting)

21:15.441 --> 21:16.374
Oh!

21:34.926 --> 21:37.361
Bananas Foster?

21:38.563 --> 21:41.999
You will make a baby
with your father's face.

21:43.302 --> 21:45.169
I'm sorry I doubted you.

21:45.171 --> 21:47.405
This is the gayest thing
I've ever seen.
