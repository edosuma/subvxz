NOW, IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME,
I'M NEXT.

13:01.322 --> 13:05.909
ERIC, YOU'RE NOT EATING.
ARE YOU SICK?

13:06.076 --> 13:07.577
YEAH, ERIC.
YOU SEEM UPSET.

13:07.745 --> 13:11.331
DID SOMETHING HAPPEN
AT THE PHARMACY?

13:11.499 --> 13:13.625
WHAT HAPPENED
AT THE PHARMACY?

13:13.793 --> 13:16.878
NOTHING.
SHUT UP.

13:17.046 --> 13:19.422
ERIC, BE NICE
TO YOUR SISTER.

13:19.590 --> 13:24.177
KITTY, WHAT HAPPENED
TO THE MAIL?

13:25.054 --> 13:28.264
I CHECKED THE MAIL, DAD.
NOTHING, NO MAIL.

13:28.432 --> 13:30.308
YOU KNOW, THE MAIL
KEEPS DISAPPEARING.

13:30.476 --> 13:35.188
I THINK WE HAVE
A LITTLE MAIL THIEF.

13:35.356 --> 13:37.023
SPEAKING OF, LAURIE,
I COULD HAVE SWORN

13:37.191 --> 13:38.650
I SAW A UNIVERSITY OF
WISCONSIN ENVELOPE

13:38.818 --> 13:40.109
STICKING OUT OF YOUR BRA.

13:40.277 --> 13:42.654
WHAT'S THAT ALL ABOUT?

13:42.822 --> 13:45.824
WHAT?

13:45.991 --> 13:50.119
DONNA'S ON THE PILL.

13:55.209 --> 13:57.877
WHAT DID YOU DO?

13:58.045 --> 14:00.213
NOTHING.
NOTHING.

14:00.381 --> 14:03.883
DINNER'S OVER.
YOU... KITCHEN... NOW!

14:04.051 --> 14:06.344
I KNOW YOU'RE 17.

14:06.512 --> 14:10.682
AND, UM, WE CAN'T STOP YOU FROM
DOING WHAT YOU WANT TO DO.

14:10.850 --> 14:11.975
YES, WE CAN.

14:12.142 --> 14:14.310
RED.

14:14.478 --> 14:17.647
ALL I'M SAYING IS
HAVE RESPECT FOR HER.

14:17.815 --> 14:21.150
YOU RESPECT HER BY KEEPING
YOUR HANDS OFF HER.

14:22.027 --> 14:25.321
YOU ARE A DIRTY,
DIRTY BOY, ERIC.

14:26.574 --> 14:30.118
OKAY, NOW, UM, LET'S TALK
ABOUT BIRTH CONTROL.

14:30.286 --> 14:31.452
BIRTH CONTROL?

14:31.620 --> 14:34.455
DON'T DO IT.
THAT'S YOUR BIRTH CONTROL.

14:35.624 --> 14:38.877
I'M GOING TO PRAY
FOR YOU, ERIC.

14:39.837 --> 14:42.755
YOU'RE THE DEVIL.

14:43.549 --> 14:44.883
AND, DAD, DID YOU
KNOW THAT LAURIE'S

14:45.050 --> 14:46.175
FLUNKING OUT OF COLLEGE?

14:46.343 --> 14:47.677
DON'T CHANGE
THE SUBJECT.

14:47.845 --> 14:50.013
YOU'VE GOT STRANGE THOUGHTS
IN YOUR LITTLE HEAD, MISTER,

14:50.180 --> 14:52.515
AND THAT DONNA'S
A NICE GIRL.

14:52.683 --> 14:56.019
RED, YOU ARE GIVING HIM
THE WRONG IDEA ABOUT SEX.

14:56.186 --> 14:57.186
IT'S NOT DIRTY...

14:57.354 --> 15:00.523
BUT IT'S NOT CLEAN EITHER.

15:02.109 --> 15:04.485
OKAY, CLEANLINESS,
NOW THAT REMINDS ME.

15:04.653 --> 15:08.197
ALWAYS MAKE SURE YOUR NAILS
ARE TRIMMED AND CLEANED.

15:09.700 --> 15:14.329
OH, FOREPLAY
IS VERY IMPORTANT.

15:21.003 --> 15:23.880
NO, NO, IT'S NOT.

15:26.300 --> 15:30.094
YES, IT IS.

15:33.599 --> 15:35.558
PERSONALLY, I'M VERY PROUD
TO HAVE A DAUGHTER

15:35.726 --> 15:37.602
WHO ACTED SO MATURE
AND RESPONSIBLE.

15:37.770 --> 15:38.811
I'M HER FATHER.

15:38.979 --> 15:40.563
YOU SHOULD HAVE
TOLD ME, MIDGE.

15:40.731 --> 15:43.274
CAN YOU IMAGINE HOW I FELT
STANDING THERE WITH ERIC

15:43.442 --> 15:47.111
WHEN THE PHARMACIST HANDED
ME BIRTH CONTROL PILLS?

15:47.821 --> 15:51.115
ERIC KNOWS?
THANKS A LOT, DAD.

15:55.913 --> 15:57.664
YOU KNOW,
SHE AND ERIC ARE DATING.

15:57.831 --> 15:58.998
ALL THE MORE REASON.

15:59.166 --> 16:00.792
OH, JEEZ!

16:00.960 --> 16:02.460
YOU'D RATHER
SHE GOT PREGNANT?

16:02.628 --> 16:04.545
THAT IS NOT GOING
TO HAPPEN TO DONNA.

16:04.713 --> 16:07.048
IT HAPPENED TO US.

16:07.216 --> 16:10.301
OH, SURE, THROW THAT
IN MY FACE AGAIN.

16:12.638 --> 16:14.263
HEY, LAURIE.
IS ERIC AROUND?

16:14.431 --> 16:15.640
NO, HE'S AT THE HUB.

16:15.808 --> 16:18.434
HEY, WATCH THE DOOR.

16:20.312 --> 16:21.729
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

16:21.897 --> 16:22.981
MY GRADES.

16:23.148 --> 16:25.984
I'VE GOT TO MAKE SOME Fs INTO
Bs BEFORE RED SEES THEM.

16:27.611 --> 16:28.569
YOU'RE FINE.

16:28.737 --> 16:29.946
RED AND KITTY ARE
WATCHING BONANZA.

16:30.114 --> 16:31.072
I GOT TO GO.

16:31.240 --> 16:33.241
HEY, SMART MOVE
GOING ON THE PILL.

16:33.409 --> 16:35.326
THAT WAS THE BEST
THING I EVER DID.

16:35.494 --> 16:37.829
JUST WAIT 'TIL
YOU GET TO COLLEGE.

16:38.998 --> 16:41.374
BYE.

16:42.334 --> 16:45.545
DONNA, GUESS WHAT?

16:45.713 --> 16:47.547
YOU'RE HAVING TWINS?

16:47.715 --> 16:50.008
NO, I'M NOT PREGNANT.

16:50.175 --> 16:51.300
OH, MY GOD.

16:51.468 --> 16:52.969
OH MY GOD, JACKIE,
THANK GOD.

16:53.137 --> 16:54.178
OH MY GOD.

16:54.346 --> 16:55.805
I CAN FORGET ABOUT
THIS WHOLE UGLY THING.

16:55.973 --> 16:58.099
PUT IT BEHIND ME AND NEVER,
EVER THINK THAT EVER...

16:58.267 --> 17:01.519
JACKIE, I AM NOT GOING TO
LET YOU FORGET ABOUT THIS.

17:01.687 --> 17:02.729
ALL RIGHT?

17:02.896 --> 17:04.355
YOU GOT REALLY, REALLY
LUCKY, AND AS YOUR FRIEND,

17:04.523 --> 17:08.234
I AM NOT GOING TO LET YOU
BE STUPID ABOUT THIS.

17:10.612 --> 17:13.156
WE'RE FRIENDS?

17:13.323 --> 17:15.658
SHUT UP.

17:17.119 --> 17:19.746
JACKIE, I WENT
ON THE PILL.

17:19.913 --> 17:21.914
OH MY GOD.

17:22.082 --> 17:25.251
YOU ARE GOING
TO BE SO POPULAR.

17:27.671 --> 17:31.424
JACKIE, I DIDN'T
DO IT TO BE POPULAR.

17:31.592 --> 17:33.384
I DID IT BECAUSE I AM
NOT GOING TO GET STUCK

17:33.552 --> 17:35.053
IN THIS DINKY
LITTLE TOWN.

17:35.220 --> 17:36.512
OKAY, WELL, YOU KNOW,
THEY'RE BUILDING

17:36.680 --> 17:37.680
A K-MART ON FRANKLIN.

17:37.848 --> 17:40.099
JACKIE, WHEN
THIS E-R-A PASSES,

17:40.267 --> 17:43.227
I'M GOING TO BE ABLE
TO DO WHATEVER I WANT.

17:43.979 --> 17:47.148
AND SO WILL YOU IF YOU
DON'T SCREW IT UP NOW.

17:48.650 --> 17:50.359
HMM.

17:50.527 --> 17:53.613
SO, DONNA, TELL ME MORE
ABOUT THIS PILL.

17:53.781 --> 17:56.240
DOES IT DO ANYTHING WEIRD
TO YOUR HAIR?

17:57.201 --> 18:00.119
MMM, ONLY
ABOVE YOUR LIP.

18:01.914 --> 18:03.998
I STILL DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY
DONNA HAS TO TAKE THIS PILL.

18:04.166 --> 18:06.459
IS SHE SICK?

18:07.628 --> 18:08.878
NO, FEZ,
SHE TAKES THE PILLS

18:09.046 --> 18:10.630
SO THAT SHE CAN HAVE
ALL THE SEX SHE WANTS

18:10.798 --> 18:14.342
AND NOT GET PREGNANT.

18:14.510 --> 18:17.261
WITH SUCH A USEFUL
PRODUCT AVAILABLE...

18:17.429 --> 18:20.973
WHAT THE HELL WERE YOU
THINKING, YOU IDIOT?

18:23.936 --> 18:25.561
FORMAN, YOU KNOW
WHAT YOU SHOULD DO, MAN?

18:25.729 --> 18:27.688
YOU SHOULD PROBABLY
BREAK UP WITH DONNA.

18:27.856 --> 18:29.774
BECAUSE THE PRESSURE OF
THAT MUCH WORRY-FREE SEX,

18:29.942 --> 18:31.984
THAT COULD KILL YOU.

18:32.152 --> 18:35.488
YEAH, THAT WOULD BE
PLAN "B", HYDE.

18:36.406 --> 18:37.698
I WISH JACKIE WOULD HAVE
THOUGHT ABOUT GOING

18:37.866 --> 18:40.284
ON THE PILL.

18:40.452 --> 18:44.455
YOU KNOW, IF I HAD A CHANCE,
I'D DO IT ALL DIFFERENT.

18:44.623 --> 18:45.957
NO, YOU WOULDN'T.

18:46.125 --> 18:48.918
YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT,
I WOULDN'T.

18:49.086 --> 18:51.796
I SHOULD HAVE BROKEN UP WITH
HER WHEN I HAD THE CHANCE.

18:55.926 --> 18:58.427
OKAY, SO, UH, ERIC,
CAN I TALK TO YOU, ALONE?

18:58.595 --> 19:00.555
SURE.

19:04.977 --> 19:06.602
MICHAEL...

19:06.770 --> 19:08.855
I'M NOT PREGNANT.

19:09.022 --> 19:10.565
YES!

19:10.732 --> 19:11.858
YES!!

19:12.025 --> 19:14.110
YES!!!

19:15.612 --> 19:17.155
SO YOU FEEL
TONS BETTER, RIGHT?

19:17.322 --> 19:19.991
OH, YEAH!

19:20.159 --> 19:21.993
GOD, THAT'S SO GREAT
'CAUSE YOU KNOW WHAT?

19:22.161 --> 19:23.953
I'M BREAKING UP WITH YOU.

19:24.121 --> 19:26.706
[TOGETHER]
WHAT?

19:26.874 --> 19:28.416
LOOK, MICHAEL, THIS
WHOLE EXPERIENCE HAS

19:28.584 --> 19:30.168
OPENED MY EYES.

19:30.335 --> 19:33.087
AND NOTHING WILL STAND
IN THE WAY OF MY DREAM

19:33.255 --> 19:36.674
OF BECOMING
A DALLAS COWBOY CHEERLEADER.

19:42.514 --> 19:47.518
DID SHE JUST
BREAK UP WITH ME?

19:47.686 --> 19:50.521
YEP.

19:51.899 --> 19:56.194
I AM SO SAD FOR YOU.

19:56.361 --> 19:59.447
MAY I PLEASE HAVE
HER PHONE NUMBER?

20:03.994 --> 20:05.203
OH MY GOD, ERIC.

20:05.370 --> 20:07.038
SO YOUR PARENTS KNOW
I'M ON THE PILL TOO?

20:07.206 --> 20:09.373
YEAH.

20:09.541 --> 20:10.958
I HAD A NICE CONVERSATION
WITH RED AND KITTY

20:11.126 --> 20:13.794
ABOUT FOREPLAY.

20:15.714 --> 20:18.257
SORRY.

20:18.425 --> 20:21.636
YEAH, ME TOO.

20:23.055 --> 20:24.805
ERIC, I DON'T WANT YOU TO
THINK THIS CHANGES ANYTHING

20:24.973 --> 20:26.849
BETWEEN US.

20:27.017 --> 20:29.936
I DON'T.

20:31.563 --> 20:37.568
BUT IT COULD, RIGHT?

20:37.736 --> 20:39.237
I SUPPOSE.

20:39.404 --> 20:42.156
I MEAN, WHO KNOWS?
IT MIGHT EVEN BE YOU.

20:47.537 --> 20:49.080
MIGHT?

20:49.248 --> 20:52.124
ALL I'M SAYING IS WE HAVE
TO WAIT FOR THE RIGHT TIME.

20:52.292 --> 20:54.794
OKAY.

20:54.962 --> 20:58.506
HOW ABOUT NOW?

20:58.674 --> 21:00.800
MMM... NO.

21:00.968 --> 21:02.301
OKAY.

21:02.469 --> 21:03.552
HOW ABOUT NOW?

21:03.720 --> 21:05.638
NO.

21:05.806 --> 21:07.139
NOW?
YES.

21:07.307 --> 21:08.432
REALLY?
NO.

21:08.600 --> 21:11.602
OKAY.

21:11.770 --> 21:14.647
NOW RIGHT?

21:17.651 --> 21:19.860
I'LL BE WAITING.

21:20.028 --> 21:21.279
(DONNA)
SHUT UP.

21:21.446 --> 21:23.239
I GOT A BIRTHDAY
COMING UP, SO...

21:23.407 --> 21:25.199
CAPTIONING MADE POSSIBLE
