Harvard must see that
because they accepted me.

00:15.983 --> 00:18.285
What's better‐‐rich or richer?
‐ Richer is.

00:18.318 --> 00:20.454

00:20.487 --> 00:23.524

He is a doctor

‐ Being so happy
we finally found a home,

among such nice people.

00:34.601 --> 00:36.403
‐ What time is
Dan getting home?

00:36.436 --> 00:38.171
‐ He's probably with Martin.

00:38.205 --> 00:41.275

01:02.529 --> 01:03.664
I don't know him.

And if I don't know him,
I don't know what I know.

01:05.666 --> 01:06.967

01:07.000 --> 01:09.002
‐ You're so lucky, Betty.

01:11.071 --> 01:12.239
‐ In Frazier v. Cupp,

01:12.272 --> 01:15.075
the Supreme Court stated
the use of extrapolation

01:15.108 --> 01:18.011
and dissembling
is not coercion.

01:18.045 --> 01:21.248
Also, the court ruled
that police trickery on its own

01:21.281 --> 01:23.350
does not deem
a confession involuntary.

01:23.383 --> 01:24.651
‐ You're saying the police

01:24.685 --> 01:26.587
lying to defendants
has justification?

01:26.620 --> 01:29.156
‐ I'm not saying it, sir.
The Supreme Court has ruled it.

01:29.189 --> 01:30.691
‐ Noted.

01:30.724 --> 01:32.826
Does that strike you
as an ethical decision?

01:32.859 --> 01:35.395
‐ In a utopia where
the truth was told

01:35.429 --> 01:38.332
always be everyone, eh...

01:38.365 --> 01:41.435
but we don't live
in a utopia...

01:41.468 --> 01:44.104
where by definition
everyone's goals are the same,

01:44.137 --> 01:48.041
so I do agree
with the Supreme Court.

01:48.075 --> 01:53.013
In the right circumstances,
lying serves a greater good.

01:53.046 --> 01:54.414
‐ Big decision, chief.

01:54.448 --> 01:56.350
Probably the biggest one
you'll ever make.

01:56.383 --> 01:57.417
‐ Yes, sir.
You need to be sure.

01:57.451 --> 01:58.719
Not that you're not,
but if you're not,

01:58.752 --> 01:59.820

We really hardly
have anything in common.

02:04.858 --> 02:06.793
‐ Except the kids.
‐ Look, I don't care why.

02:06.827 --> 02:08.528
I'm just making sure
that you know why,

02:08.562 --> 02:10.330
making sure that there is
a why and you're not

02:10.364 --> 02:11.698
just pulling a rip cord
'cause it's there.

02:11.732 --> 02:12.799

02:12.833 --> 02:15.535
You cannot liquidate
a legal partnership on a whim.

02:15.569 --> 02:17.704
Am I right, Danny boy?

02:31.518 --> 02:33.553
‐ Not since Sunday,
but she said she was coming.

02:33.587 --> 02:35.722
‐ At least
she's calling you back.

02:35.756 --> 02:37.391
I'm not saying
that I don't understand

02:37.424 --> 02:38.558
why she's gone to ground.

02:38.592 --> 02:39.660
She's humiliated.

She thinks everyone's

02:42.095 --> 02:44.998
Well, all right,
but we are talking about it

02:45.032 --> 02:46.066
because we want to help.

02:46.099 --> 02:48.268

that way to her.

Anyway, she said she's coming.

in the last few years.
