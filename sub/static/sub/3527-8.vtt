WEBVTT

00:01.402 --> 00:02.903
Previously, on The Tudors.
- This plague that has come upon us

00:02.937 --> 00:05.439
is a punishment from God.
We're all sinners

00:05.506 --> 00:07.441
and God is displeased with us.

00:07.508 --> 00:10.678
Whether we live or die is
entirely in his hands.

00:10.745 --> 00:12.713
You've come back
from Paris.

00:12.780 --> 00:14.582
So we are once more allies
with the French.

00:14.615 --> 00:16.784
- And we are both officially
at war with the emperor.

00:16.851 --> 00:19.687
- Do I have my divorce?
- I have arranged

00:19.754 --> 00:23.257
to send 2 young lawyers to meet
the Pope at Orvieto near Rome.

00:23.290 --> 00:28.129
I am appointing Cardinal
Campeggio as my official legate.

00:28.195 --> 00:31.198
Once the sickness of your country
abates, you will travel to England

00:31.265 --> 00:34.135
and together with Cardinal
Wolsey, constitute a court

00:34.235 --> 00:37.371
to decide upon
the merits of the case.

00:37.438 --> 00:39.974
- Norfolk has sent me.
- But Norfolk hates me.

00:40.074 --> 00:43.210
- There is someone
he hates even more.

00:43.277 --> 00:45.980
- He wants you to
help us destroy Wolsey.

00:46.047 --> 00:48.282
More, if you are not for me
now then you are against me.

00:48.315 --> 00:52.820
The King now dines with Norfolk and
Boleyn. They are my bitter enemies

00:52.920 --> 00:55.723
and if you do not help me,
then you help them!

00:55.790 --> 00:58.159
Thomas Tallis,
we love your music.

00:58.225 --> 01:00.327
- Stay a moment.
- Why me?

01:00.428 --> 01:03.731
- When I looked at you and
saw a light around your head.

01:03.798 --> 01:06.667
- My sister!
- What's wrong?

01:06.734 --> 01:08.602
- I can't breathe,
stop the carriage.

01:08.669 --> 01:10.671
Stop the carriage!

01:10.771 --> 01:12.973
- Lady Anne is ill.
For the love of God.

01:13.007 --> 01:15.443
Save her life.

01:15.509 --> 01:19.313
- You know what you've done
child? You've risen from the dead.

01:19.347 --> 01:22.149
Now you can see the King again.
It could be just as before.

01:25.186 --> 01:28.756
- Thank you. Thank you God.

01:31.192 --> 01:33.160
<i>- You think you know a story. </i>

01:33.194 --> 01:35.696
<i>But you only know how it ends. </i>

01:35.763 --> 01:37.798
<i>To get to the heart
of the story,</i>

01:37.865 --> 01:40.801
<i>You have to go back
to the beginning. </i>

03:40.054 --> 03:45.126
- Your Grace... His Eminence,
Cardinal Campeggio.

03:54.402 --> 03:58.973
- Ah! Lorenzo, my old friend.

03:59.106 --> 04:02.143
- My dear Wolsey.

04:02.243 --> 04:04.311
- Come.

04:04.412 --> 04:07.715
- Your Grace must
forgive my incapacity.

04:07.782 --> 04:11.652
God has given me gout,
as a great trial.

04:20.894 --> 04:22.830
- Now...

04:22.897 --> 04:26.467
His Majesty is very keen

04:26.500 --> 04:29.003
that the legatine court
be set up straight away

04:29.070 --> 04:31.238
to determine the case
for his annulment.

04:31.339 --> 04:33.341
- Indeed, indeed.

04:33.441 --> 04:36.410
I have the Pope's written commission
to decide upon this matter.

04:36.477 --> 04:41.082
And from my decision,
there can be no appeal.

04:41.182 --> 04:43.684
And yet...

04:43.784 --> 04:46.487
If your Grace
had some water.

04:46.520 --> 04:48.356
- Water!

04:50.791 --> 04:52.693
- Mixed, perhaps,
with a little wine?

04:55.329 --> 04:57.264
- And yet?

04:57.331 --> 05:01.802
- You and I are
old friends.

05:01.869 --> 05:05.506
And we are both men of
the world, Cardinal Wolsey.

05:05.539 --> 05:07.875
I even have a son
who travels with me.

05:07.942 --> 05:09.944
- And so?

05:10.011 --> 05:13.714
- His Holiness wishes
to satisfy the King,

05:13.814 --> 05:16.217
however difficult
that might be.

05:16.350 --> 05:18.386
But for all our sakes

05:18.452 --> 05:20.388
would it not be better
if you and I were to try

05:20.454 --> 05:22.957
and persuade his Majesty
to give up his divorce?

05:23.024 --> 05:26.227
Surely his passion
for this...

05:26.293 --> 05:28.662
girl, will alter
and fade with time,

05:28.729 --> 05:31.665
as all such passions
inevitably do.

05:31.732 --> 05:34.635
- I fear your Eminence may have
proceeded here in ignorance.

05:34.702 --> 05:37.972
Let me make certain things
plain to you.

05:38.039 --> 05:41.575
If you do not grant
the King his divorce,

05:41.642 --> 05:46.147
papal authority in England
will be annihilated.

05:46.213 --> 05:49.817
Now you should remember that
the greater part of Germany

05:49.884 --> 05:52.753
has already become
estranged from Rome,

05:52.820 --> 05:55.856
the same thing
could happen here.

05:55.923 --> 05:59.827
It would mean the total
ruin of the Kingdom.

06:06.033 --> 06:07.935
- Is there any danger
that they could declare

06:08.035 --> 06:10.604
your marriage valid?

06:10.671 --> 06:14.542
- Wolsey has assured me that the
Pope has already decided in my favour.

06:14.608 --> 06:16.677
The trial is just for
the sake of appearances

06:16.744 --> 06:19.747
and a way of
appeasing the Emperor.

06:21.882 --> 06:24.652
- Then we can start
planning the wedding?

06:24.752 --> 06:27.221
- Yes.

06:27.288 --> 06:29.290
Yes, my love.

06:35.563 --> 06:38.265
Also for the sake of appearances
there is something else.

06:40.301 --> 06:44.305
For a while I shall have to
share Catherine's table.

06:44.372 --> 06:46.507
and sometimes her bed.

06:48.743 --> 06:50.644
- Her bed?!

06:50.745 --> 06:52.480
- It's nothing!

06:52.580 --> 06:54.582
My lawyers have
just advised me

06:54.648 --> 06:57.952
that to do otherwise
might risk countersuit.

06:57.985 --> 07:01.055
I could be seen to be acting
against her conjugal rights.

07:01.122 --> 07:04.125
- You think its nothing to go
back to bed with your wife?!

07:04.158 --> 07:06.761
- What do you think
is going to happen?

07:06.827 --> 07:08.996
- What usually happens!

07:11.032 --> 07:13.834
- How little you trust me!

07:13.901 --> 07:16.070
- I trust you!

07:16.170 --> 07:19.206
I love you!

07:28.516 --> 07:31.852
- Catherine is not to
blame for this. Nor am I.

07:31.952 --> 07:34.188
But the fact is, Excellence,
we broke God's law,

07:34.288 --> 07:36.323
for which there can be
no dispensation.

07:38.526 --> 07:43.130
You understand how deeply this
touches my conscience

07:43.197 --> 07:45.866
and how quickly
I need it to be resolved?

07:45.933 --> 07:49.136
- I do.
I sympathize

07:49.203 --> 07:51.672
as does his Holiness.
Naturally.

07:51.706 --> 07:54.542
But his Holiness also
suggests to your Majesty

07:54.608 --> 07:56.544
another possible solution.

08:00.014 --> 08:02.550
- I have already made it plain to
your Eminence that his Majesty...

08:02.650 --> 08:04.552
- No, no, no. Prego.
This is not the same, my friend.

08:04.652 --> 08:08.189
This is a solution, which should
very much please his Majesty.

08:08.222 --> 08:09.790
- What is it?

08:09.857 --> 08:13.227
- His Holiness is aware
of the Queen's great piety.

08:13.327 --> 08:18.399
She herself has spoken of it. Her love for
the Mother of God, for the saints and so on.

08:18.499 --> 08:20.968
And he wonders if
her Majesty might be persuaded,

08:21.035 --> 08:24.238
like Jeanne de Valois,
the sometime wife of Louis XII,

08:24.305 --> 08:27.708
to abdicate
her marriage

08:27.742 --> 08:30.578
and retreat to a nunnery.

08:33.080 --> 08:35.015
- What do you think,
Wolsey?

08:35.082 --> 08:39.086
- It would certainly
expedite matters.

08:39.186 --> 08:42.089
It would save us
the pain of a trial.

08:42.155 --> 08:44.358
And, since
it would be voluntary,

08:44.425 --> 08:46.861
it couldn't offend
her nephew the Emperor.

08:46.927 --> 08:49.163
And moreover,

08:49.230 --> 08:52.600
it would afford her Majesty
an honourable retirement.

08:55.569 --> 08:58.072
- You will put this
to her right away!

08:58.105 --> 09:01.742
- Majesty.

09:04.779 --> 09:08.382
Will your Majesty at least
consider the proposal?

09:08.449 --> 09:11.419
- I will give you
my answer in due course,

09:11.452 --> 09:14.955
after I have spoken with
the King, my husband.

09:17.091 --> 09:18.926
Father, will you hear
my confession later?

09:18.959 --> 09:20.961
- Yes, my child.

09:25.766 --> 09:28.803
- Your Majesty.
- Your Eminence.

09:28.869 --> 09:30.971
- Your Majesty.

09:33.307 --> 09:35.376
I beg that you yield
to the King's will.

09:35.443 --> 09:38.212
- And what is his will?
- As his Eminence proposes:

09:38.279 --> 09:41.148
that you join a religious
community of your choosing

09:41.215 --> 09:43.751
and take a vow
of perpetual chastity.

09:43.818 --> 09:45.820
- You speak to me of chastity?!

09:45.920 --> 09:49.757
Have you not a mistress
and 2 children, your Eminence?

09:49.824 --> 09:51.992
- Your Majesty is entering the
third period of your natural life.

09:52.059 --> 09:54.562
You have spent the first 2 setting
a good example to the world.

09:54.628 --> 09:57.965
With this single act, you could put
the seal on all your good actions.

09:57.998 --> 10:00.001
- Please rise, your Grace.

10:00.067 --> 10:02.303
It is not seemly
for a man of your dignity

10:02.336 --> 10:04.939
to be seen to beg in public,
whatever the cause.

10:08.342 --> 10:11.012
rts tgeup]

10:11.045 --> 10:13.047
¶

10:29.864 --> 10:32.233
- So. You talked to Campeggio?
- Yes.

10:32.299 --> 10:34.235
I told him I could
not give him an answer

10:34.301 --> 10:36.504
without your Majesty's
permission.

10:36.570 --> 10:41.175
- And what answer will you give him?
- I will tell him the truth.

10:41.242 --> 10:46.013
- Catherine! All the world now agrees
that your marriage to me was unjust.

10:46.080 --> 10:48.849
Even you must
acknowledge it!

10:48.916 --> 10:52.186
So unless you agree to take the
veil, I shall have to force you.

10:57.658 --> 10:59.593
- Do I have your permission
to talk to Campeggio?

11:02.430 --> 11:04.598
I will not speak to him
if you do not want me to.

11:22.249 --> 11:25.386
- My Lady.
- Lady Anne.

11:25.453 --> 11:27.621
- Master Cromwell.

11:27.688 --> 11:30.958
Do you... Do you have
a message from the King?

11:31.025 --> 11:33.961
- I think we understand
each other.

11:34.061 --> 11:38.299
A mutual friend, a Mr. Fish,

11:38.399 --> 11:41.302
now living in exile in Holland
has sent me a gift for you.

11:41.369 --> 11:44.805
- What is it, Master Cromwell?

11:44.872 --> 11:46.741
- "The Obedience
of the Christian Man,"

11:46.807 --> 11:48.943
by William Tyndale.

11:48.976 --> 11:52.446
It contains many good
criticisms of the papacy

11:52.480 --> 11:55.249
and of the arrogance
and abuses of priests.

11:55.316 --> 11:57.718
You'll find it
most illuminating.

11:57.785 --> 12:02.757
But always and ever be cautious
as to whom you show this.

12:02.857 --> 12:06.427
You must know it might be
accounted heresy even to possess it

12:06.494 --> 12:08.996
and Wolsey is still keen enough
to prosecute heretics...

12:09.096 --> 12:11.132
as we are called,

12:11.165 --> 12:13.234
who embrace the true religion.

12:13.300 --> 12:17.505
- I will

12:17.571 --> 12:19.607
and God bless you,
Master Cromwell.

12:22.677 --> 12:24.645
Wait.

12:29.784 --> 12:32.787
Please will you give this
to the King...

12:32.853 --> 12:34.755
with my love.

12:34.822 --> 12:37.792
- My Lady.

12:50.538 --> 12:52.473
Come here.

12:55.843 --> 12:57.678
Chicken...

12:57.712 --> 12:59.680
Ch...

13:01.716 --> 13:03.617
Good chicken.

13:03.684 --> 13:05.553
Shh... Shh...

13:11.292 --> 13:13.728
Don't run away!

13:18.199 --> 13:20.167
Got ya.

13:25.806 --> 13:27.708
- You never even
told me your name.

13:27.742 --> 13:29.410
- Jane.

13:29.477 --> 13:32.813
- Jane.

13:32.880 --> 13:35.049
Why did you leave the court?

13:37.585 --> 13:39.720
When your sister died...

13:41.822 --> 13:44.759
- My sister is still
here, Thomas Tallis.

13:44.825 --> 13:48.929
She hasn't left me.

13:48.996 --> 13:51.766
She can't leave me.

13:54.568 --> 13:56.771
¶

14:04.779 --> 14:07.715
You can see her
too, can't you?

14:12.687 --> 14:15.923
¶

14:15.956 --> 14:19.026
- I came all
the way from London.

14:19.093 --> 14:21.062
And I really want you
to come back to court.

14:21.128 --> 14:23.130
- Why?

14:23.230 --> 14:25.399
You liked my sister more
than me. I could tell.

14:28.469 --> 14:31.572
- I want to marry you, Jane.

14:48.222 --> 14:48.289
<i>- In nomine Patris et Filii
et Spiritus Sancti. Amen. </i>

14:52.993 --> 14:55.596
What is it you wish to confess?

14:55.663 --> 14:59.066
- Father, I wish to tell you
about my first marriage

14:59.133 --> 15:01.936
to Prince Arthur,
his Majesty's older brother.

15:02.003 --> 15:04.171
- I know of it. Go on.

15:04.238 --> 15:07.641
- He never knew me.

15:07.675 --> 15:10.778
I swear to you,
under the sacramental oath.

15:10.845 --> 15:15.016
<i>I was intatta e incorrotta da lui
come venne dal ventre di sue madre. </i>

15:15.082 --> 15:17.852
- I want to be clear:

15:17.918 --> 15:21.856
you say you were untouched and
unviolated by Prince Arthur,

15:21.922 --> 15:24.792
as when you came
from the womb of your mother?

15:24.859 --> 15:27.194
- Yes, Father.

15:27.294 --> 15:32.500
<i>- So you came to the King's bed
a virgin, intatta e incorrotta?</i>

15:32.533 --> 15:34.802
- Yes, Father.

15:34.869 --> 15:39.874
Father, I say in all humility,

15:39.940 --> 15:43.711
I cannot accede to your request.

15:43.811 --> 15:46.180
I am the true and legitimate
wife of his Majesty,

15:46.213 --> 15:48.149
therefore your proposal
is inadmissible.

15:48.215 --> 15:50.651
Come what may,

15:50.718 --> 15:53.654
I will live and die in that
vocation to matrimony

15:53.721 --> 15:55.656
to which God has called me.

15:55.723 --> 15:59.226
- I understand.

15:59.326 --> 16:02.563
- Furthermore,

16:02.663 --> 16:05.066
I give you permission to break
the seal of the confessional

16:05.166 --> 16:07.668
and tell the whole world
what I have told you!

16:07.735 --> 16:10.638
¶

16:26.787 --> 16:31.158
- Henry wants you
back at court.

16:31.225 --> 16:34.195
You are his sister
after all.

16:34.261 --> 16:37.698
- How can I return while he
flaunts himself with his slut?

16:37.765 --> 16:41.535
I would be seen to be approving
of his ridiculous liaison.

16:41.602 --> 16:45.072
- Margaret, you and I must stay in the
King's good graces or we are nothing.

16:45.139 --> 16:47.174
Let him marry
who he wishes.

16:47.241 --> 16:50.077
- That was always your
philosophy, wasn't it, Charles?

16:50.144 --> 16:53.214
So very cynical.

16:53.280 --> 16:56.717
Is that why you keep company
with that devil Boleyn?

16:56.784 --> 16:59.653
- You liked him enough once
when he helped us back to court.

16:59.720 --> 17:01.655
Or were you just
being cynical?

17:01.722 --> 17:03.724
- I didn't see
all of his game.

17:03.791 --> 17:07.728
Now I do. I despise him.
- So do I!

17:07.795 --> 17:10.263
But I hate
Wolsey more.

17:10.330 --> 17:12.233
It's a marriage
of expedience.

17:12.299 --> 17:14.902
- Rather like ours?

17:18.571 --> 17:21.175
- No. I loved you.

17:21.242 --> 17:23.210
- You don't know the
meaning of the word, Charles.

17:23.277 --> 17:25.646
You can love,

17:25.713 --> 17:29.250
perhaps, for a year
or a month, a day...

17:29.316 --> 17:33.020
even for an hour.

17:33.087 --> 17:36.023
And in that hour

17:36.090 --> 17:41.295
I do believe you love
as well and deeply...

17:41.362 --> 17:43.330
as any man.

17:45.633 --> 17:48.502
But after that hour,

17:48.569 --> 17:50.538
you love not.

17:53.140 --> 17:55.242
You love another

17:55.309 --> 17:58.379
and then another.

17:58.446 --> 18:00.381
Your love...

18:03.351 --> 18:07.121
is most generous
where it is most hurtful.

18:07.188 --> 18:10.024
- Margaret.

18:10.091 --> 18:12.893
- Don't play the fool, Charles.
It doesn't become you.

18:19.166 --> 18:21.168
¶

18:35.716 --> 18:37.785
- Eminence.

18:37.852 --> 18:39.920
- I need to see
Cardinal Campeggio.

18:39.987 --> 18:42.790
- Forgive me.
My father is indisposed.

18:46.594 --> 18:49.330
In any case, there is nothing
further he can do for the time being.

18:49.397 --> 18:51.332
He has sent some
reports to Rome

18:51.399 --> 18:53.334
and must await
the eplies from his Holiness.

18:55.369 --> 18:57.338
And in the meantime,

18:57.405 --> 19:00.007
my poor father
needs to rest

19:00.074 --> 19:02.910
and restore
his strength.

19:17.758 --> 19:21.262
- Lady Anne.
- Good evening, lady Anne.

19:23.497 --> 19:26.534
- There is the Mistress Boleyn?
- Yes. There she is.

19:26.600 --> 19:29.470
The girl for whom the King
would sacrifice his marriage to

19:29.537 --> 19:34.241
a most gracious & loving Queen.
- I have tried to argue him out of his course

19:34.308 --> 19:38.279
but I swear an angel descending
from heaven would not dissuade him.

19:38.346 --> 19:41.716
Do you think they have taken
things to the ultimate conjunction?

19:48.255 --> 19:51.225
I have received a petition from the Dukes
of Suffolk and Norfolk and Lord Boleyn,

19:51.292 --> 19:53.327
saying the divorce has

19:53.394 --> 19:56.030
the overwhelming support of
the people of England.

19:56.097 --> 19:57.898
- As your Eminence
would quickly discover,

19:57.965 --> 20:01.168
if you stepped outside
these doors and saw the people

20:01.235 --> 20:03.237
that is a manifest lie!

20:03.304 --> 20:06.574
On the contrary.
The people love their Queen

20:06.640 --> 20:09.276
and they have
every reason to do so.

20:16.317 --> 20:18.319
Do excuse me.

20:23.157 --> 20:25.326
Wolsey.

20:25.393 --> 20:27.695
- Her Majesty
has refused the offer.

20:28.896 --> 20:31.499
- Are you surprised?

20:31.565 --> 20:34.135
- However, Campeggio tells me
that the Pope is prepared

20:34.201 --> 20:37.171
to consider
legitimizing any children

20:37.238 --> 20:38.739
that you might have
with Mistress Boleyn,

20:38.806 --> 20:41.442
whether you are
married or not.

20:41.509 --> 20:43.844
- Are you mad?

20:43.911 --> 20:46.147
You're going to have
to do a lot better than that.

20:53.921 --> 20:55.790
- Forgive me,
Ambassador Mendoza.

21:02.129 --> 21:04.098
I am new
to this court.

21:04.165 --> 21:06.467
Who are these men
talking with the King?

21:06.534 --> 21:08.402
- Lord Rochford is
the father of Anne Boleyn

21:08.469 --> 21:11.238
and Norfolk is her uncle.

21:11.305 --> 21:13.808
Like the Duke of Suffolk,
they are Wolsey's sworn enemies

21:13.874 --> 21:16.210
and everyone at court knows it.

21:16.277 --> 21:18.079
They would stop at nothing
to bring him down.

21:18.145 --> 21:20.181
- Yet the King still loves him?

21:20.247 --> 21:22.083
- Not so much
as before, perhaps.

21:22.149 --> 21:26.520
But the Cardinal should
never be underestimated.

21:28.989 --> 21:31.125
- May I know what you think
of the King's matter?

21:31.192 --> 21:34.228
- It is no secret that
the Emperor is outraged

21:34.295 --> 21:36.931
at the King's behaviour
toward the Queen.

21:36.997 --> 21:39.600
And I can tell you,
in strict confidence,

21:39.667 --> 21:41.602
that he has written
to his Holiness

21:41.669 --> 21:44.805
demanding that the matter be
settled in Rome, not here.

21:44.872 --> 21:47.108
- He would not seek to interfere

21:47.174 --> 21:49.143
in any other way?

21:49.210 --> 21:51.178
- In what way?

21:51.245 --> 21:53.647
- Well, if the Queen
were to be renounced,

21:53.714 --> 21:56.984
might he consider military
intervention on her behalf?

21:57.051 --> 21:59.653
- He has not said so.

21:59.720 --> 22:02.223
- Has anyone asked him?
- No.

22:02.289 --> 22:03.791
¶

22:03.858 --> 22:06.027
Not yet.

22:06.093 --> 22:09.964
- Your Majesty.
- Margaret...

22:12.933 --> 22:16.370
- Not her!
She's not worth it!

22:16.437 --> 22:19.306
She's a cheap nothing.

22:19.373 --> 22:22.143
Open your eyes!
Look at her!

22:22.209 --> 22:24.211
Look at yourself!

22:24.278 --> 22:27.381
- Look to your own marriage.

22:35.322 --> 22:38.426
How are you?

22:38.492 --> 22:41.495
- Burning.

22:41.562 --> 22:43.698
Burning with
impatience.

23:35.916 --> 23:37.918
- My Lady, Archbishop Warham

23:37.985 --> 23:40.454
and Bishop Tunstall
are here to see you.

23:47.128 --> 23:49.230
- My lords,

23:49.296 --> 23:52.867
I understand that you are among
my council for the legatine court.

23:52.933 --> 23:55.002
As honourable men;

23:55.069 --> 23:58.472
whose first duty is to God and
your conscience, you are welcome.

23:58.539 --> 24:01.509
Has the King sent you?
- Yes, your Majesty.

24:01.575 --> 24:03.644
- We must discuss
your brief.

24:03.711 --> 24:07.948
I have nothing against his Majesty,
whom I love with all my being

24:08.015 --> 24:11.552
only against his advisers

24:11.619 --> 24:14.822
and a certain woman whose
ambition would ruin a kingdom.

24:14.889 --> 24:16.824
- Madam,

24:16.891 --> 24:20.294
we are not here to
discuss a brief, or any such.

24:20.361 --> 24:21.729
- But...

24:21.796 --> 24:23.931
- We came here
to report, Madam,

24:23.998 --> 24:26.901
that rumours of plots against
the life of his Majesty are abroad

24:26.967 --> 24:30.705
and plots against
Cardinal Campeggio.

24:30.771 --> 24:32.807
If any such plots
were to be successful,

24:32.873 --> 24:35.743
then clearly both you
and your daughter

24:35.810 --> 24:39.547
would be suspected
of involvement.

24:43.084 --> 24:46.420
- I cannot believe the King would
give credence to such rumours,

24:46.487 --> 24:51.025
since he knows, as you know,

24:51.092 --> 24:53.627
that I value my husband's life
even much more than my own.

24:53.694 --> 24:57.164
- Madam?
There is yet another complaint.

24:57.231 --> 25:01.402
That you are flippant and show
yourself too much to the people.

25:01.469 --> 25:05.606
That you rejoice in their acclaim,
smiling, nodding and waving at them.

25:05.673 --> 25:09.744
Therefore we suppose
that you hate the King.

25:09.810 --> 25:12.046
- Why should you suppose that?

25:12.113 --> 25:14.515
- Because Madam,
you don't accept

25:14.582 --> 25:16.684
that all this time you've
been living in sin with him.

25:16.751 --> 25:19.220
And even when the truth
has been revealed,

25:19.286 --> 25:21.555
you refuse to accept
the King's gracious offer

25:21.622 --> 25:24.091
to retire to
a religious house.

25:24.158 --> 25:26.694
- Ah, that again!

25:26.761 --> 25:29.163
I have answered
for that already:

25:29.230 --> 25:31.332
God never called me
to a nunnery.

25:31.399 --> 25:35.569
I am his Majesty's true
and legitimate wife.

25:35.636 --> 25:37.805
- Madam, for
the love of God...

25:37.872 --> 25:40.107
- Yes! For the love of God!

25:40.174 --> 25:42.743
As you yourself
once professed, Archbishop!

25:42.810 --> 25:44.912
You told people that
you knew my case to be true.

25:44.979 --> 25:46.847
So what changed your mind?

25:46.914 --> 25:50.084
Hmm?

25:50.151 --> 25:52.086
Was it Wolsey?

25:52.153 --> 25:55.122
Tell me, do you prefer
your place

25:55.189 --> 25:57.892
in this Earth rather
than your place in Heaven?

25:57.958 --> 26:01.262
- You have not answered
the charges.

26:01.328 --> 26:04.365
- Sir!

26:04.432 --> 26:06.333
I consider it hard indeed
to be charged

26:06.400 --> 26:09.070
and accused by my own lawyers!

26:09.136 --> 26:12.606
Where is the justice in that?

26:15.209 --> 26:19.146
I will speak to you no more but
you will not act for me.

26:32.259 --> 26:36.230
¶

27:09.530 --> 27:13.100
- Catherine,

27:13.167 --> 27:15.903
why do you go on
denying me justice?

27:15.970 --> 27:19.540
You're so heartless.

27:19.607 --> 27:22.576
So full of hatred.

27:25.713 --> 27:28.649
I can't persuade myself
any longer that you love me.

27:28.716 --> 27:30.918
- I do love you.

27:30.985 --> 27:34.088
I've never ceased to
love you. You know that.

27:34.155 --> 27:36.724
- I don't know it.

27:36.791 --> 27:39.527
Perhaps you should be kept
away from our daughter...

27:39.593 --> 27:43.164
in case you start
poisoning her mind against me.

27:43.230 --> 27:46.100
- How can you say
these things to me?

27:46.167 --> 27:48.469
After all this time. After all
that we have meant to each other.

27:52.006 --> 27:54.375
- I'm only asking you
to be reasonable.

27:54.442 --> 27:56.877
- I am being reasonable. It is
you who will not be reasonable.

28:12.860 --> 28:16.297
- What is it
you really want, Thomas?

28:16.364 --> 28:18.999
- Want?
- In life?

28:19.066 --> 28:21.802
What do you want?

28:21.869 --> 28:24.538
- I don't know.

28:24.605 --> 28:26.741
Travel, I suppose.

28:26.807 --> 28:29.577
Adventure. If I could.

28:29.643 --> 28:33.514
- Travel?! Where would you go?
- Have you not heard?

28:33.581 --> 28:37.551
Sea-discoverers to
new worlds have gone.

28:37.618 --> 28:39.787
Cabot to Newfoundland,

28:39.854 --> 28:43.290
others to America,
the Indies.

28:43.357 --> 28:45.893
Some speak of
China and Cathay,

28:45.960 --> 28:49.397
the fabled lands of Marco Polo.

28:49.463 --> 28:51.365
<i>But where would you go?</i>

28:59.840 --> 29:02.977
- I'd set out here...

29:03.044 --> 29:06.447
but the hair is a forest
of ambush and snares.

29:06.514 --> 29:09.617
But the brow
becalms us,

29:09.684 --> 29:14.121
when it's smooth
and plain,

29:14.188 --> 29:17.091
the dark pools of the eyes
are dangerous to our ship,

29:17.158 --> 29:20.861
for to be drawn into them
would be shipwreck.

29:20.928 --> 29:24.665
The nose like
the first meridian,

29:24.732 --> 29:29.403
directs us down to the Islands
Fortunate, the swelling lips.

29:29.470 --> 29:32.807
I would
anchor here

29:32.873 --> 29:37.144
and hear
the sirens' songs.

29:43.284 --> 29:45.353
Then sailing on,

29:45.419 --> 29:48.155
past the glorious
promontory of chin.

29:48.222 --> 29:51.492
We may encounter
some islands,

29:51.559 --> 29:55.963
as we travel down
towards your India.

29:56.030 --> 29:59.367
And we pause
at the Atlantic navel.

29:59.433 --> 30:01.736
Where the current
carries our pilot on.

30:01.802 --> 30:04.372
To another forest.

30:04.438 --> 30:07.575
Where many are shipwrecked.

30:07.641 --> 30:09.677
And no further ever get.

30:25.826 --> 30:28.062
- I have a new motto.

30:30.197 --> 30:32.166
- What is it?

30:35.136 --> 30:37.505
- You'll have to find it!

30:44.979 --> 30:47.915
- Where is it?

30:47.982 --> 30:49.984
- On a piece of ribbon

30:50.051 --> 30:52.586
hidden somewhere.

31:00.661 --> 31:02.563
- Is it...

31:02.630 --> 31:05.232
Here?

31:05.299 --> 31:07.301
- No!

31:14.308 --> 31:16.777
- Down there?
- No.

31:37.598 --> 31:39.533
- Is it down here?

31:39.600 --> 31:42.770
- I can't wait
much longer.

31:42.837 --> 31:45.339
- You won't have to.

31:49.543 --> 31:51.579
- Mmmm...

31:51.645 --> 31:54.715
- Your Majesty...
There are fresh delays!

31:54.782 --> 31:56.817
No one can see Campeggio!

31:56.884 --> 32:00.187
- Where is it?
Tell me!

32:00.254 --> 32:02.757
- What if someone
is deliberately stalling?

32:02.823 --> 32:06.260
Delaying things?
Making excuses?

32:06.327 --> 32:08.429
- Campeggio?

32:08.496 --> 32:10.464
- No. No someone else.

32:10.531 --> 32:12.466
Someone much
closer to you.

32:28.516 --> 32:30.685
- Ah! I'm touching it.

32:43.731 --> 32:45.700
<i>Ainsi sera,</i>

32:45.766 --> 32:49.003
<i>grogne qui grogne. </i>

32:53.441 --> 32:57.812
- That's how it's going to be!
Let them grumble.

33:06.721 --> 33:09.223
Someone much closer
to you.

33:13.394 --> 33:16.130
- I want to ask you,
frankly, about Campeggio.

33:16.197 --> 33:20.634
Do you trust him?

33:20.701 --> 33:23.504
Do you think
he's compromised?

33:23.571 --> 33:27.074
Who knows, perhaps he's getting
a pension from the Emperor.

33:27.141 --> 33:30.378
- As I know it, Lorenzo is
the least prejudicial of men.

33:30.444 --> 33:33.414
And he has suffered personally at
the hands of Charles's soldiers.

33:33.481 --> 33:35.850
When they entered Rome
they ransacked his house.

33:35.916 --> 33:37.752
I don't believe he has
any love for the Emperor.

33:37.852 --> 33:39.887
- Then why is he
delaying the trial?

33:39.920 --> 33:43.491
- There are some technical
matters that need to be resolved.

33:43.557 --> 33:45.593
That's all.

33:45.659 --> 33:47.561
There is nothing for your
Majesty to be concerned about.

33:47.595 --> 33:50.498
- God damn it! It's not
Campeggio at all! It's you!

33:50.564 --> 33:53.434
You're the one
delaying things!

33:53.534 --> 33:55.403
You've gone cold
on this divorce.

33:55.436 --> 33:57.405
Perhaps you never believed
in it in the first place!

33:57.438 --> 33:59.440
You lied to me.
Pretending to be on my side!

33:59.540 --> 34:03.344
- Majesty, I swear
before you and before God,

34:03.411 --> 34:06.247
on my honour I am
your most humble servant

34:06.280 --> 34:10.885
and there is nothing on Earth I covet
so much as advancing your divorce.

34:10.951 --> 34:13.754
To bring it to pass
is my continual study

34:13.788 --> 34:15.790
and my most ardent desire,

34:15.856 --> 34:17.792
for which I am ready
to expend my life,

34:17.858 --> 34:20.728
and my body, and my blood,
so help me God!

34:37.078 --> 34:40.081
- Come your Grace.
Don't be so dismayed.

34:43.317 --> 34:47.054
You understand
my impatience.

34:47.121 --> 34:50.091
I know
it's not you.

34:50.157 --> 34:53.427
I trust you.

34:53.494 --> 34:56.664
I've known you
a long time.

34:56.731 --> 35:00.901
Come, let's talk
of other things.

35:04.505 --> 35:07.908
- By God's body,
Master More.

35:07.975 --> 35:12.780
Indignatio
princeps mors est.

35:15.483 --> 35:18.519
- The anger of
the prince means death.

35:18.586 --> 35:21.122
¶

35:23.791 --> 35:25.726
- Majesty.

35:31.699 --> 35:34.235
- I want you to go
to Rome Mister Cromwell.

35:34.301 --> 35:37.171
I want you to force his fucking
Holiness into submission,

35:37.238 --> 35:38.506
if necessary by
telling him that

35:38.572 --> 35:40.574
if he does not grant me
my fucking annulment,

35:40.641 --> 35:42.743
then England will withdraw
its submission to Rome,

35:42.810 --> 35:44.979
and I will withdraw
my allegiance to him.

35:45.046 --> 35:48.616
And make sure he knows
this is no idle threat.

35:48.683 --> 35:52.286
I mean it! And I will do it
if he does not satisfy me.

35:57.124 --> 35:59.360
Send in the Duke of Suffolk!

35:59.393 --> 36:03.130
- My Lord Duke, the King summons you.
- Charles!

36:06.467 --> 36:08.436
I have a task
for you.

36:08.502 --> 36:10.771
I want you to go to Paris
and seek out King Francis.

36:10.838 --> 36:13.374
Question him closely
about Campeggio.

36:13.441 --> 36:15.609
Ask him what kind of
dealings he's had with him?

36:15.676 --> 36:17.545
What kind of man he is?
Is he honest?

36:17.611 --> 36:20.414
Does he have
any ambitions to be Pope?

36:20.481 --> 36:22.516
And does he have any secret
dealings with the Emperor?

36:22.583 --> 36:27.121
- I'll leave at once.
- And Charles!

36:30.725 --> 36:32.727
Ask him about Wolsey.

36:32.793 --> 36:37.031
I want to know everything
he knows about him.

36:37.098 --> 36:39.700
You understand?
- Mmm hmm.

36:39.767 --> 36:41.669
- I want to know whose
side Wolsey is on.

36:51.712 --> 36:53.681
- Sir Thomas?

36:58.386 --> 37:00.321
- Most gracious
sovereign lady.

37:00.388 --> 37:03.657
I have brought
Bishop Fisher to see you.

37:03.724 --> 37:07.194
I believe he can offer you
true and devoted counsel.

37:07.261 --> 37:09.163
- Thank you,
Sir Thomas.

37:12.666 --> 37:14.635
- Majesty.

37:16.671 --> 37:18.639
- Please.

37:24.278 --> 37:26.647
- Lord Bishop.

37:26.714 --> 37:29.083
Are you certain that
you wish to act for me?

37:29.150 --> 37:33.054
You must be aware of the dangers
and difficulties you may face.

37:33.120 --> 37:37.725
I would understand if you would
prefer peace and tranquility.

37:37.792 --> 37:40.928
- Gentle Madam, what peace
or tranquility can there be

37:40.995 --> 37:44.031
without justice
and the love of God?

37:46.067 --> 37:48.369
I have studied the case
against you very carefully.

37:48.436 --> 37:50.404
They will no doubt
press the fact

37:50.471 --> 37:53.474
that the Pope's dispensation to
allow you to marry the King

37:53.541 --> 37:57.078
was technically faulty
and therefore invalid.

37:57.144 --> 38:01.182
But the obvious way
of resolving

38:01.248 --> 38:03.484
any such technical deficiency

38:03.551 --> 38:06.220
is not to declare
the marriage null and void

38:06.287 --> 38:11.125
but to issue fresh and
more perfect dispensation.

38:11.192 --> 38:15.663
In any case,
the continuance of so long space

38:15.730 --> 38:17.598
has rendered
the marriage honest,

38:17.665 --> 38:20.334
<i>and the principle
of Supplet Ecclesia</i>

38:20.401 --> 38:22.403
"Let the Church provide"

38:22.470 --> 38:24.605
has itself made
good any defects

38:24.672 --> 38:27.074
in the Pope's
dispensation.

38:27.141 --> 38:29.377
- Then you suppose we may win?

38:29.443 --> 38:32.780
- We may win the argument, yes.

38:32.847 --> 38:35.349
But I cannot pretend
that it will avail us much.

38:37.385 --> 38:40.021
We shall still try.

38:40.087 --> 38:42.823
Be of good cheer, Madam.

38:42.890 --> 38:47.528
For we are on
the side of the angels.

38:50.031 --> 38:53.134
Hearts are trumps.

38:56.837 --> 38:58.739
- What is it?

38:58.806 --> 39:00.708
- I've heard from Cromwell.

39:00.775 --> 39:03.978
He was eventually allowed
access to the Pope,

39:04.045 --> 39:06.981
but wrote in desperation.
- Why?

39:07.048 --> 39:09.450
- He doesn't believe Clement
will do anything for me.

39:09.517 --> 39:12.687
<i>He said... "It might be
in his Pater Noster,</i>

39:12.753 --> 39:14.755
but it's nothing in his creed!"

39:14.822 --> 39:18.092
He means the Pope might pray
for me to solve my problems

39:18.159 --> 39:20.695
but he won't personally commit
to doing anything about it!

39:25.499 --> 39:28.803
Show.
¶

39:28.869 --> 39:30.571
Show me.

39:52.026 --> 39:55.229
- Yes. We entertained the Pope's
legate as he passed through France.

39:55.296 --> 39:57.832
And I spoke personally
to Campeggio.

39:57.898 --> 40:00.968
He was very careful.

40:01.035 --> 40:05.506
But even in the few words he spoke, I thought he dissembled.
- In what way dissembled?

40:05.573 --> 40:08.642
- I think he shows one face
but conceals another.

40:08.709 --> 40:12.279
He has been asked to deal with
a matter he secretly despises.

40:12.346 --> 40:14.382
So my advice

40:14.448 --> 40:16.851
to the King,
my brother

40:16.917 --> 40:19.220
is to not put
too much trust in any man,

40:19.286 --> 40:22.156
in case he should
be deceived.

40:22.223 --> 40:24.425
- And would you say
the same of Cardinal Wolsey?

40:29.363 --> 40:32.133
- I have nothing
against his Eminence.

40:32.199 --> 40:34.235
- Of course not.

40:34.301 --> 40:36.771
But what do you think his
attitude is towards the divorce?

40:38.906 --> 40:41.342
- As far as I could tell, he
wanted the divorce to go through

40:41.409 --> 40:44.945
because he has
no love for the Queen.

40:45.012 --> 40:48.149
At the same time...

40:48.215 --> 40:50.217
- At the same time?

40:50.284 --> 40:53.020
- It is also my impression that he has
marvelous intelligence with the Pope;

40:53.087 --> 40:55.089
they understand
each other.

40:55.156 --> 40:57.858
And also with
Cardinal Campeggio.

40:57.925 --> 41:01.395
Therefore, if he has such understanding
with them and they are not themselves minded

41:01.462 --> 41:03.431
to advance
the King's matter,

41:03.497 --> 41:05.499
then to speak frankly
to you, I think the King

41:05.566 --> 41:08.636
should take a closer
interest in it himself.

41:12.773 --> 41:15.643
That is my advice.

41:15.710 --> 41:19.580
<i>- Majesté. 
</i>

41:25.986 --> 41:27.788
- Where has he going?

41:27.855 --> 41:31.425
- I'm sure to service
his latest mistress.

41:31.492 --> 41:33.861
- Why would he have
to do that

41:33.928 --> 41:36.063
when he has such
a beautiful wife?

41:36.130 --> 41:38.466
- You should ask him,
Monsieur.

41:43.137 --> 41:45.306
- Don't you ever want to pay him back?
- Of course.

41:45.373 --> 41:48.342
Always.
I'm a woman.

41:48.409 --> 41:50.845
- Then go to
bed with me.

41:54.949 --> 41:56.884
- If you like.

41:56.951 --> 41:59.453
But tell me first.

41:59.520 --> 42:02.590
<i>How is your
beautiful wife?</i>

42:02.656 --> 42:05.626
- She...
- She's just like me, non?

42:05.693 --> 42:09.096
You have affairs
and she ignores it.

42:09.163 --> 42:13.467
To make love
for revenge or pain...

42:13.534 --> 42:17.004
What is that?

42:17.071 --> 42:19.440
It hurts the mind
and the soul.

42:19.507 --> 42:23.678
<i>It shrinks. Oui?
Vous comprenez ça, Monsieur?</i>

42:23.744 --> 42:25.980
The soul grows smaller

42:26.047 --> 42:28.683
and perhaps
it even dies.

42:43.264 --> 42:46.667
- Your Grace.
- Your Grace.

42:46.734 --> 42:47.568
- Leave us.

42:55.543 --> 42:57.411
The trial
is coming.

42:57.478 --> 43:00.648
- Indeed
your Grace.

43:16.497 --> 43:19.300
- I want to make it
plain to you again.

43:19.367 --> 43:22.236
If you refuse to
grant the divorce,

43:22.303 --> 43:27.074
you will provoke a marvelous
opinion against the Pope,

43:27.141 --> 43:30.845
against the papal courts
and against the papacy itself!

43:30.911 --> 43:33.347
- I am obliged to
the Holy Father,

43:33.414 --> 43:36.250
to seek truth
and justice in this matter.

43:36.317 --> 43:38.819
And that, your Grace,
I will attempt to do,

43:38.886 --> 43:41.288
as God is my witness.

43:41.355 --> 43:43.524
- You still don't
seem to understand.

43:43.591 --> 43:45.526
So let me spell
it out for you.

43:45.593 --> 43:48.062
If you fail to find
in favour of the King,

43:48.129 --> 43:50.998
you will lose the King

43:51.065 --> 43:54.702
and the devotion of
his Realm to Rome

43:54.769 --> 43:58.072
and you will also
utterly destroy me

43:58.139 --> 44:00.374
and that
I cannot allow!

44:00.441 --> 44:02.843
- I totally understand.

44:06.247 --> 44:09.717
You must have faith,
Cardinal Wolsey.

44:12.053 --> 44:13.988
- God help me.

44:23.230 --> 44:25.266
My Lords,

44:25.332 --> 44:29.270
it has become obvious that
Wolsey is severely compromised

44:29.337 --> 44:33.107
and he no longer enjoys the affinity
he used to share with his Majesty.

44:33.174 --> 44:36.444
The King is suspicious
of his first minister

44:36.510 --> 44:38.746
and we should encourage
those suspicions.

44:38.813 --> 44:42.983
- It is time to bring him down.
- Here is a pamphlet.

44:43.050 --> 44:47.755
You see it mocks his period in
office as a time of pride, waste,

44:47.822 --> 44:50.991
repression
and ineffectual policies.

44:51.058 --> 44:53.561
It's ready for distribution.

44:53.627 --> 44:56.664
- We shall call for the immediate
arrest of Wolsey and his agents,

44:56.731 --> 44:58.632
the impounding
of all their papers

44:58.699 --> 45:02.436
and a thorough examination
of his administration.

45:02.503 --> 45:07.041
His corruption will be exposed
and treason guaranteed.

45:07.108 --> 45:10.878
All that remains, Boleyn, is for
your daughter to prove to the King

45:10.945 --> 45:13.347
that all his suspicions
are justified.

45:13.414 --> 45:15.383
- And then...

45:15.449 --> 45:18.386
the Cardinal will be naked to
his enemies.

45:20.454 --> 45:22.623
- To England.
- To England.

45:24.658 --> 45:26.660
¶

45:52.953 --> 45:55.890
- Christ!
- Sorry. Sorry.

45:55.956 --> 45:58.492
I'm sorry.
- Dog!

46:43.170 --> 46:46.707
<i>- In nomine Patris
et Filii et Spiritus Sancti. </i>

46:46.774 --> 46:49.043
Amen.

46:49.143 --> 46:52.013
I declare this legatine court,

46:52.046 --> 46:54.882
commissioned by his Holiness,
Pope Clement,

46:54.949 --> 46:56.884
is now in session,

46:56.984 --> 47:00.388
and all that is said here
is said under oath

47:00.454 --> 47:03.024
and in the presence
of God Almighty.

47:03.057 --> 47:06.694
I call upon his Majesty
to speak first

47:06.727 --> 47:09.630
as to this matter.

47:19.407 --> 47:22.576
- Your Eminences know well
what cause I have to be here.

47:22.677 --> 47:26.313
It concerns some scruples
I have regarding my marriage,

47:26.380 --> 47:28.716
which prick my conscience.

47:28.749 --> 47:34.588
I have consulted widely to
discover the truth

47:34.689 --> 47:37.825
and I have read in Leviticus

47:37.892 --> 47:39.894
that it was against God's law,

47:39.927 --> 47:43.931
and a sin, for me to
marry my brother's wife.

47:44.031 --> 47:46.867
Your Eminences,

47:46.934 --> 47:51.105
I am not the only one who questions
the validity of my marriage.

47:51.205 --> 47:53.274
All of my bishops share my doubt

47:53.374 --> 47:57.945
and they have signed a petition
to put the matter to question.

47:58.012 --> 48:01.415
- My Lords, I tell you now,

48:01.449 --> 48:04.218
I never signed my name to
any such document.

48:04.285 --> 48:06.287
And if it appears there...

48:06.387 --> 48:08.856
- The court has not invited
you to speak, your Grace...

48:08.923 --> 48:11.792
- If it appears there
then Bishop Tunstall

48:11.892 --> 48:14.028
wrote it without my consent!

48:14.095 --> 48:17.098
- The King has the floor,
sit down sir. Sit!

48:17.131 --> 48:18.966
- Well, well. I'm not going
to argue with you now.

48:21.535 --> 48:23.471
After all you are but one man.

48:26.474 --> 48:30.311
As for the main issue,
if I am asked

48:30.411 --> 48:33.647
why I waited so long to bring
this question to trial,

48:33.714 --> 48:36.384
I shall answer truthfully

48:36.450 --> 48:40.321
that it was the great love that
I bore for her Majesty,

48:40.388 --> 48:42.823
which prevented me doing so.

48:42.890 --> 48:47.895
It is I myself who bare
all responsibility,

48:47.962 --> 48:52.333
for my conscience,
which troubles and doubts me.

48:52.400 --> 48:55.102
Gentlemen of the court,

48:55.169 --> 48:59.173
I ask for one thing and
one thing only.

49:01.442 --> 49:03.444
Justice.

49:10.584 --> 49:15.189
- In a moment the court will
call upon the Queen's Majesty

49:15.289 --> 49:16.824
to reply to
the King's statement.

49:16.857 --> 49:20.127
But first I must tell the court

49:20.194 --> 49:24.031
that the Queen has sought
through her advisers,

49:24.131 --> 49:29.370
to question the competence of
this court to try her case.

49:29.470 --> 49:34.108
Further she questions
the impartiality of her judges.

49:34.175 --> 49:36.711
And finally, she contends
that this matter is already

49:36.777 --> 49:38.879
in the hands of a higher
authority, namely the Pope

49:38.946 --> 49:41.215
and therefore can
only be tried in Rome.

49:43.017 --> 49:45.720
Now, as to the first matter,

49:45.820 --> 49:49.290
Cardinal Campeggio and I
can confirm that we have

49:49.357 --> 49:52.360
the necessary authorization
from his Holiness

49:52.393 --> 49:54.895
to try this matter here.

49:54.962 --> 49:58.866
Further, we reject
any notion of prejudice

49:58.899 --> 50:01.335
on our part

50:01.402 --> 50:03.571
and will continue to try
the case here

50:03.671 --> 50:06.240
as we have been appointed.

50:06.307 --> 50:09.744
So, I call upon her Majesty,
Queen Catherine,

50:09.810 --> 50:12.413
to address the court.

50:27.728 --> 50:29.663
- My Lord.

50:32.333 --> 50:34.368
Sir.

50:39.440 --> 50:42.543
I beseech you
for all the love

50:42.610 --> 50:44.779
that has been between us,

50:44.879 --> 50:47.882
let me have
justice and right,

50:47.948 --> 50:51.619
give me some pity and compassion,
for I am a poor woman, and a stranger,

50:51.686 --> 50:54.955
born out of
your dominion.

50:55.056 --> 50:58.025
I have no friend here
and little counsel.

50:58.092 --> 51:01.629
I flee to you as head
of justice in this realm.

51:01.729 --> 51:04.131
I call God

51:04.198 --> 51:06.934
and all the world to witness
that I have been to you a true,

51:06.967 --> 51:09.370
humble and obedient wife,

51:09.437 --> 51:12.807
ever comfortable
to your will and pleasure.

51:12.907 --> 51:15.476
I have loved all those whom
you have loved, for your sake,

51:15.543 --> 51:17.478
whether or not
I had cause,

51:17.578 --> 51:20.881
whether they be
my friends or enemies.

51:25.019 --> 51:28.255
By me you have
had many children,

51:28.322 --> 51:30.491
although it has pleased God
to call them from this world.

51:32.560 --> 51:34.495
But when you
had me at first,

51:34.595 --> 51:37.131
I take God
as my judge!

51:37.164 --> 51:42.670
I was a true maid,
without touch of man!

51:42.737 --> 51:46.173
And whether or not it be true,

51:46.240 --> 51:51.178
I put it to
your conscience.

51:51.245 --> 51:53.681
¶

52:10.431 --> 52:12.566
- Now what
is she doing?

52:18.739 --> 52:20.808
- Catherine, Queen of England!

52:20.875 --> 52:23.044
Come back into the court!

52:26.480 --> 52:28.382
Come back into the court!

52:31.218 --> 52:34.522
- Perhaps your Majesty should
turn back! You're being called.

52:34.588 --> 52:36.657
- This court has no meaning for
me. Therefore I will not stay here.

52:36.724 --> 52:39.994
- Catherine, Queen of England!

52:40.061 --> 52:43.097
Come back into the court!

53:05.519 --> 53:07.922
- She spits
in the face of papal law!

53:07.988 --> 53:09.990
She holds
this court in contempt!

53:41.989 --> 53:44.191
Your Majesty.
