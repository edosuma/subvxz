00:22.515 --> 00:25.585
<i>Come on, it's just a word.</i>

00:25.618 --> 00:27.419
<i>Say it, already.</i>

00:27.454 --> 00:28.555
Alright, you got this.

00:32.659 --> 00:37.996
I want your hot, throbbing...

00:38.030 --> 00:39.432
Ugh.

00:39.466 --> 00:42.100
Uh-uh. No. Gross.

00:42.134 --> 00:43.068
And painful.

00:43.101 --> 00:45.438
Who would ask for hot,
throbbing anything?

00:45.472 --> 00:47.139
Throbbing is what happens
to your finger

00:47.172 --> 00:48.741
when you slam it
in the car door.

00:50.275 --> 00:51.611
I want it now.

00:51.644 --> 00:55.113
Your hot, throbbing...

00:58.451 --> 01:00.787
Ok.

01:02.689 --> 01:03.823
Give it to me.

01:03.857 --> 01:09.762
And by "it", I mean I want
your hot, throbbing... nope!

01:09.796 --> 01:10.597
No!

01:10.630 --> 01:12.599
Not at all convincing!

01:12.632 --> 01:14.132
God, Luce, it's a word.

01:14.166 --> 01:16.201
It's a word,
just say it already.

01:16.736 --> 01:17.704
Alright.

01:22.842 --> 01:26.411
I want your hot, throbbing...

01:28.481 --> 01:29.549
For the love of god!

01:29.582 --> 01:32.351
Cock! Cock! Cock!

01:32.384 --> 01:33.486
Cock! Cock!

01:33.520 --> 01:35.020
Cock!

01:39.592 --> 01:45.498
Oh... um, my friend has this
farm and there's this rooster.

01:45.532 --> 01:46.799
Troublemaker.

01:51.103 --> 01:52.304
Alright.

01:52.337 --> 01:57.075
Well, that is a... sentence
that's just never gonna happen.

04:25.458 --> 04:27.560
<i>Wait, what's he doing
with his hand?</i>

04:27.593 --> 04:29.327
<i>That actually feels good.</i>

04:29.361 --> 04:31.229
<i>So that was an accident.</i>

04:31.263 --> 04:33.298
You're so... good to me.

04:36.602 --> 04:37.235
Hey.

04:37.269 --> 04:37.837
Hmm?

04:37.870 --> 04:38.705
Are we good?

04:38.738 --> 04:39.371
Yeah.

04:39.404 --> 04:39.906
You like that?

04:39.939 --> 04:40.440
Ok. Good.

04:40.473 --> 04:43.576
<i>Ok, sexy thoughts.</i>

04:43.609 --> 04:47.013
<i>A cabana on a hot,
tropical beach.</i>

04:47.046 --> 04:48.246
<i>I'm getting a massage,</i>

04:48.280 --> 04:53.619
<i>which suddenly turns into
spontaneous, unbridled sex.</i>

04:53.653 --> 04:54.954
<i>With Steve Carell.</i>

04:54.987 --> 04:57.957
<i>Only like in his newer movies,
with silver hair.</i>

04:57.990 --> 04:59.291
Yes!

04:59.324 --> 04:59.859
Yes!

04:59.892 --> 05:00.793
I'm coming!

05:00.827 --> 05:01.961
Yes!

05:01.994 --> 05:03.361
Wheat-free waffles!

05:03.395 --> 05:05.363
<i>Shit, did I just say
that out loud?</i>

05:05.397 --> 05:06.799
Huh?

05:06.833 --> 05:07.967
Sorry.

05:08.000 --> 05:08.868
Just a second.

05:10.402 --> 05:11.904
That was what I forgot
at the store.

05:11.938 --> 05:13.806
I couldn't remember all day.

05:15.475 --> 05:16.876
No, no, no, no.

05:16.909 --> 05:17.577
It's good.

05:17.610 --> 05:20.012
My mind is completely free.

05:20.312 --> 05:21.981
I'm ready now.

05:24.751 --> 05:27.987
Yeah... I don't think you are.

05:38.363 --> 05:40.566
We should get a ceiling fan.

05:41.834 --> 05:43.368
Hey, what're you doing?

05:43.970 --> 05:45.872
No-don't mess up my lists.

05:45.905 --> 05:46.839
Why?

05:46.873 --> 05:48.474
It's not like you ever finish
any of them.

05:48.508 --> 05:49.307
That is not true.

05:49.341 --> 05:50.710
Just because you're
angry, don't-

05:50.743 --> 05:51.544
Ok, look.

05:51.577 --> 05:53.446
Most women, during sex,
you know,

05:53.479 --> 05:55.615
they say things like...

05:55.648 --> 05:58.350
I don't-like, "yes, yes,
give it to me good".

05:58.383 --> 06:01.654
Who says that?

06:01.687 --> 06:02.522
People.

06:02.555 --> 06:04.056
People who you know?

06:04.090 --> 06:05.958
You honestly want me
to yell out,

06:05.992 --> 06:07.927
"Yes, yes, give it to me good"?

06:07.960 --> 06:11.363
Well, it would be better
than "wheat-free waffles".

06:11.396 --> 06:14.433
Why don't you just admit
that you're not into sex?

06:14.467 --> 06:16.903
I'm so not not into sex.

06:16.936 --> 06:19.038
You didn't even take off
your pyjamas!

06:19.071 --> 06:21.373
Yeah, well, they're comfortable!

06:21.941 --> 06:22.775
What're you doing?

06:22.809 --> 06:24.076
You gotta
be kidding me.

06:24.110 --> 06:27.046
I have work to do.

06:27.079 --> 06:27.747
I'm on a deadline.

06:27.780 --> 06:30.016
You work in the garage, alright?

06:30.049 --> 06:32.552
Testing video games!

06:35.855 --> 06:37.456
Don't judge me.

06:42.962 --> 06:44.530
Sorry, Mr. Bach.

06:44.564 --> 06:50.335
I need something with
a little more spirit.

06:54.941 --> 06:56.408
Great.

06:57.443 --> 06:58.744
Where is my cord?

07:23.035 --> 07:25.872
Oh my god, he's a regular.

07:30.042 --> 07:32.678
Don't stop!

07:32.712 --> 07:39.018
Oh my-oh my... that
is a lot of vagina.

07:39.051 --> 07:42.021
<i>Yes, yes, give it to me good!</i>

07:42.054 --> 07:45.925
Oh my god, did she really
just say that?

07:47.727 --> 07:49.428
Thank you, sweetie.

07:50.663 --> 07:51.564
I thought you were evolved.

07:51.597 --> 07:54.500
We met at a film festival,
for god's sake!

07:54.533 --> 07:55.635
What're you talking about?

07:55.668 --> 07:59.438
What I'm talking about is that.

07:59.472 --> 08:01.974
What is that?

08:02.008 --> 08:03.576
I don't know, a girl?

08:03.609 --> 08:04.477
No.

08:04.510 --> 08:05.478
I'm a girl.

08:05.511 --> 08:06.879
That is a vixen.

08:06.913 --> 08:08.514
Whatever.

08:08.547 --> 08:09.682
Excuse me?

08:09.715 --> 08:11.050
What, I'm not enough?

08:11.083 --> 08:12.051
Look, ok, yeah.

08:12.084 --> 08:15.154
I'm sorry you're upset,
but you kinda have this,

08:15.187 --> 08:19.558
like, irrational fear of
intimacy or anything

08:19.592 --> 08:21.193
that can't be put on a list.

08:21.227 --> 08:23.596
You are talking sensuality to me
as you are sitting there

08:23.629 --> 08:25.898
hacking heads off?

08:25.932 --> 08:26.999
Oh, is this funny to you?

08:27.033 --> 08:28.601
Really?

08:31.837 --> 08:33.940
Since when are you
a porn person?

08:33.972 --> 08:38.878
Well, I'm a guy,
so since always.

08:41.714 --> 08:43.149
Oh, see, that's bullshit.

08:43.182 --> 08:45.184
I just got killed
by crossfire again.

08:45.217 --> 08:47.053
How are you being so
nonchalant about this?

08:47.086 --> 08:47.987
In this day in age,

08:48.020 --> 08:49.689
when women are finally
standing up to men

08:49.722 --> 08:51.557
who use sex as a tool
of oppression, you're-

08:51.590 --> 08:53.926
Woah, woah,
woah, woah, woah!

08:53.960 --> 08:56.228
I'm not oppressing anyone, ok?

08:56.262 --> 09:00.066
They put it out there,
guys pay for it, and girls,

09:00.099 --> 09:02.001
everyone's happy.

09:02.034 --> 09:05.037
Have... have you ever watched
a porn film?

09:05.071 --> 09:06.706
I think I just saw plenty,

09:06.739 --> 09:09.041
and I hardly think
that the word film applies,

09:09.075 --> 09:11.978
not when it degrades
the entire female species.

09:12.011 --> 09:14.580
Yeah, see, I don't think so.

09:14.613 --> 09:16.649
I think it's just a business.

09:16.682 --> 09:17.683
Oh.

09:17.717 --> 09:18.784
Oh, ok. I see.

09:18.818 --> 09:21.587
So it's just a collection of
highly-skilled workers

09:21.620 --> 09:22.955
providing a service.

09:22.989 --> 09:24.056
Yeah, exactly.

09:24.090 --> 09:28.094
And the best are banking
millions and the rest are

09:28.127 --> 09:34.100
compensated really well
for their... artistry.

09:34.133 --> 09:35.534
Artistry?

09:35.568 --> 09:36.969
Yeah.

09:37.003 --> 09:38.604
Mmmhmm. Yeah. Yes.

09:38.637 --> 09:40.940
It's uh, it's kinda like you
with your violin.

09:40.973 --> 09:41.907
Right?

09:41.941 --> 09:43.042
Is it so hard for you
to understand that,

09:43.075 --> 09:47.546
you know, this is how some
people express themselves?

09:47.580 --> 09:49.982
What I can't believe is that
you are attempting

09:50.016 --> 09:54.954
to draw a parallel
between what I do and this.

09:54.987 --> 09:57.156
That's because
you're pornophobic.

09:57.189 --> 09:58.657
That's not even a word.

09:58.691 --> 10:00.593
You know, how uptight you are,

10:00.626 --> 10:03.162
it's kinda like your
whole life problem.

10:03.195 --> 10:04.964
No, even words are
too much for you.

10:04.997 --> 10:05.598
We're done.

10:05.631 --> 10:07.166
Wait, no, we're not done.

10:07.199 --> 10:08.100
Lucy.

10:08.134 --> 10:08.934
Come here.

10:08.968 --> 10:09.869
Ow, Jesus. Come on.

10:09.902 --> 10:10.603
Ugh.

10:10.636 --> 10:11.137
Lucy, come back.

10:11.170 --> 10:12.071
Hey! Wait!

10:12.104 --> 10:14.707
Just try saying something racy.

10:14.740 --> 10:15.509
Like what?

10:15.541 --> 10:18.177
Like, I don't know,
like... use

10:18.210 --> 10:21.213
"hot, throbbing cock"
convincingly in a sentence.

10:21.247 --> 10:22.815
Why would anyone do that?

10:22.848 --> 10:24.784
And by the way, since when
do we spy on each other?

10:24.817 --> 10:25.651
I mean, spying?

10:25.684 --> 10:26.185
That's not cool.

10:26.218 --> 10:28.020
I wasn't spying!

10:28.054 --> 10:29.989
And I don't know
who you are anymore.

10:30.022 --> 10:32.691
Yeah, well I don't know
you worse!

10:34.126 --> 10:36.896
Well, I'm not gonna compete
with all of that.

10:36.929 --> 10:39.665
So... so you need to decide.

10:39.698 --> 10:42.034
It's me or the porn!

10:44.904 --> 10:45.805
Really?

10:45.838 --> 10:48.140
That's what you consider
an essential item?

10:48.174 --> 10:50.309
He's autographed.

10:51.343 --> 10:52.845
Come on, bud.

10:52.878 --> 10:55.047
Don't-don't crease
and don't break.

10:55.081 --> 10:57.616
Alright, it's just
you and me now.

11:09.762 --> 11:11.697
I hope you get that stick
out of your ass!

11:11.730 --> 11:12.832
Why?

11:12.865 --> 11:15.034
So you can use it
on yourself?!

11:19.939 --> 11:20.739
Hi, Mr. Glassell.

11:20.773 --> 11:22.007
Good morning.

11:22.041 --> 11:23.943
It was.

11:30.149 --> 11:30.816
<i>Where are you?</i>

11:30.850 --> 11:31.350
<i>You're late.</i>

11:31.383 --> 11:32.351
<i>You're never late.</i>

11:32.384 --> 11:33.152
<i>I'm worried.</i>

11:33.185 --> 11:34.987
<i>Should I be worried?</i>

11:43.262 --> 11:43.929
I'm coming.

11:43.963 --> 11:45.064
Sorry.

11:48.367 --> 11:50.069
Ok, so sorry.

11:50.903 --> 11:52.104
Where have you been?

11:52.138 --> 11:53.706
The bride's about
to start trotting up.

11:53.739 --> 11:54.907
Sorry.

11:56.008 --> 11:56.775
A bride on a horse.

11:56.809 --> 11:57.977
What could go wrong?

11:58.744 --> 12:00.012
Play.

12:28.140 --> 12:29.909
Hello there, Mr. Best Man.

12:30.510 --> 12:31.977
Oh, no, that's actually
my friend Grant.

12:32.011 --> 12:33.946
I think he's just a groomsman.

12:37.049 --> 12:38.951
Matrimony.

12:40.520 --> 12:42.955
The commemoration of
an unshakable bond.

12:45.525 --> 12:47.293
Oh, dear me.

12:47.326 --> 12:50.029
Oh my-oh my god.

12:50.062 --> 12:51.163
Yeah, no, this wedding
is awesome.

12:51.197 --> 12:52.264
That could not
have been the plan.

12:54.467 --> 12:55.502
Oh gosh.

12:58.070 --> 12:59.271
<i>Is that horse poo?</i>

12:59.305 --> 13:00.706
<i>God, it smells.</i>

13:02.141 --> 13:03.309
Pretend it's not there.

13:03.842 --> 13:07.346
Oh, she's gonna remember
this day, isn't she?

13:07.379 --> 13:09.215
You wanted the horse, ok?

13:09.248 --> 13:11.784
Well, if she cancels she still
has to pay us, right?

13:11.817 --> 13:13.453
Yes, especially because it was
Grant who referred us

13:13.486 --> 13:14.720
for the job.

13:14.753 --> 13:17.156
I just-I'm sorry, I can't get
over how he is so good-looking

13:17.189 --> 13:18.891
and you never told me about him.

13:18.924 --> 13:20.192
You don't date actual adults.

13:20.226 --> 13:21.160
Kale?

13:21.193 --> 13:22.361
He's an adult.

13:22.394 --> 13:24.363
He picks you up on a skateboard.

13:24.396 --> 13:25.231
It's ok, everyone.

13:25.264 --> 13:26.265
I'm ok.

13:26.533 --> 13:28.100
Why are you giving my dude
such a hard

13:28.133 --> 13:29.034
time when this one over here,

13:29.068 --> 13:31.937
she's sleeping on Captain
America sheets.

13:33.072 --> 13:33.906
Lucy, are you alright?

13:33.939 --> 13:34.441
Are you crying?

13:34.474 --> 13:35.374
I was just kidding.

13:35.407 --> 13:38.277
Yeah, it was just a joke
about the sheets.

13:38.578 --> 13:40.079
Jeff left me.

13:40.913 --> 13:42.348
He moved out.

13:43.249 --> 13:45.050
<i>Are you ok?</i>

13:45.084 --> 13:47.019
I'm so sorry, Luce,
that's terrible.

13:55.027 --> 13:56.395
Ok, now.

13:56.429 --> 13:57.363
Where were we?

13:57.396 --> 13:59.031
We're going to get married now.

13:59.064 --> 14:00.866
Yeah.

14:09.174 --> 14:11.377
I don't know,
it's all such a blur.

14:11.410 --> 14:12.278
Actually, no.

14:12.311 --> 14:14.013
It started while
we were having sex, and-

14:14.046 --> 14:15.582
Ok.

14:15.615 --> 14:18.150
Is that why you guys fought?

14:18.183 --> 14:21.153
I remembered an item
off of my grocery list, so-

14:21.186 --> 14:22.821
Oh, honey.

14:22.855 --> 14:24.990
How do you expect to survive
marriage week after week,

14:25.024 --> 14:26.191
year after year?

14:26.225 --> 14:31.263
Sex with the same person in
the same order for 27 years.

14:31.297 --> 14:33.399
Well, until you find yourself
one day dressing up for the guy

14:33.433 --> 14:35.401
who sprays for bugs.

14:35.435 --> 14:37.269
Well, how do you expect
to survive all that

14:37.303 --> 14:38.471
if you can't focus now?

14:38.505 --> 14:43.208
I might have focus issues
but he is into porn, alright?

14:43.242 --> 14:44.176
It's disgusting!

14:44.209 --> 14:47.079
It was all over his computer,
he is totally-

14:47.112 --> 14:48.380
A man?

14:48.414 --> 14:51.116
All men look at dirty pictures,
married or not.

14:51.150 --> 14:53.118
It's-it's how they maintain
their vigour.

14:53.152 --> 14:53.952
Right, Paul?

14:53.986 --> 14:55.020
Well, it's-

14:55.054 --> 14:57.156
When men start declining
sexually by the age of 18.

14:57.189 --> 14:59.158
Once they hit 30
it's a ski slope.

14:59.191 --> 15:00.859
I beg your pardon.

15:00.893 --> 15:02.294
Except for Paul.

15:02.328 --> 15:03.996
Who is, I'm sure,
a sexual wonder.

15:04.029 --> 15:05.864
Didn't your girlfriend leave
you for a woman, though?

15:05.898 --> 15:06.700
Ok, easy.

15:06.733 --> 15:08.334
Wait, does this mean
you have porn?

15:08.367 --> 15:08.901
Hmm?

15:08.934 --> 15:10.169
And go to strip clubs?

15:10.202 --> 15:11.170
No, I do not go
to strip clubs.

15:11.203 --> 15:12.171
Ever?

15:12.204 --> 15:13.440
I have, but it's not like I do.

15:13.473 --> 15:15.040
Do you use the internet?

15:15.074 --> 15:15.608
Define "use".

15:15.642 --> 15:16.443
What about prostitutes?

15:16.476 --> 15:17.510
No, not the ones
who do it for crack.

15:17.544 --> 15:20.045
I mean like the ones you go
to that thing in Vegas

15:20.079 --> 15:21.080
that I've seen on HBO.

15:21.113 --> 15:22.014
Do you know what?
I'm out.

15:22.047 --> 15:22.881
I knew it.

15:22.915 --> 15:24.049
Hello.

15:24.083 --> 15:25.452
Ask me about sex.

15:25.485 --> 15:27.086
I'm right here.

15:27.119 --> 15:28.020
No.

15:28.053 --> 15:29.355
Your enthusiasm is really
un-relatable.

15:29.388 --> 15:30.222
Oh, come on.

15:30.255 --> 15:32.157
I got this whole library
of cliterature.

15:32.191 --> 15:32.891
You can just-

15:32.925 --> 15:34.126
What?

15:34.159 --> 15:36.929
Books you diddle to, babe.

15:36.962 --> 15:37.831
Please, girl.

15:37.863 --> 15:40.065
Tell me that you masturbate,
at least.

15:41.100 --> 15:42.101
No.

15:42.134 --> 15:43.936
This is not about me, alright?

15:43.969 --> 15:45.404
This is about my
boyfriend leaving

15:45.438 --> 15:48.575
because I think being a pervert
is really inappropriate.

15:48.608 --> 15:54.980
I also have blindfolds,
handcuffs, vibrators...

15:57.049 --> 15:58.150
Priscilla has them, too!

15:58.183 --> 16:00.219
Oh, the buzz buzz,
not the rest of it.

16:00.252 --> 16:01.153
You do?

16:01.186 --> 16:02.154
It's called a personal massager.

16:02.187 --> 16:03.490
I got it at Brookestone.

16:03.523 --> 16:05.324
Really?

16:05.357 --> 16:06.325
Oh.

16:06.358 --> 16:10.129
Well... but you have Stanley.

16:10.162 --> 16:12.432
Vibrators are necessary,
my dear.

16:12.465 --> 16:14.366
Because life is short

16:14.400 --> 16:17.637
and explaining things
to men is long.

16:38.458 --> 16:40.593
<i>Sex to do list.</i>

16:40.627 --> 16:44.096
<i>Number one.

16:44.129 --> 16:47.434

<i>Number 11.

17:06.050 --> 17:07.252
<i>Number 12...</i>

17:07.286 --> 17:11.156
<i>Use "hot, throbbing cock"
convincingly in a sentence.</i>

17:11.190 --> 17:12.525
There.

17:12.559 --> 17:17.095
And I can even check
the last one off right now.

17:23.367 --> 17:25.672
For the love of god, cock!

17:25.704 --> 17:28.173
<i>Cock! Cock! Cock!</i>

17:28.207 --> 17:29.609
<i>Cock! Cock.</i>

17:29.642 --> 17:31.210
I want your cock!

17:32.612 --> 17:34.112
Well done.

17:35.180 --> 17:36.281
Cock.

17:53.500 --> 17:55.000
God!

17:57.737 --> 17:58.538
Hey!

17:58.571 --> 18:00.072
Woah!

18:00.105 --> 18:02.809
Oh, Grant, you gotta go
check out the ballroom, man.

18:02.842 --> 18:04.544
The bridal party's twerkin'.

18:06.211 --> 18:06.646
Woah.

18:06.679 --> 18:07.279
You're kidding.

18:07.312 --> 18:08.515
Ah, ah!

18:10.850 --> 18:12.217
<i>Ugh!</i>

18:13.720 --> 18:15.420
<i>Oh my god,
are you serious?</i>

18:16.388 --> 18:17.356
Hello?

18:17.389 --> 18:19.224
<i>I can't believe you
would do this to me.</i>

18:19.258 --> 18:19.826
<i>What, Jeff?</i>

18:19.859 --> 18:21.628
<i>I'm not enough for you?</i>

18:21.661 --> 18:23.028
<i>Ugh!</i>

18:26.466 --> 18:27.800
Everything alright in there?

18:29.101 --> 18:30.637
<i>Coming in.</i>

18:38.811 --> 18:39.512
You alright, love?

18:39.546 --> 18:41.246
You want me to get the doctor?

18:42.314 --> 18:43.081
What?

18:43.115 --> 18:44.149
Why-no.

18:44.182 --> 18:45.150
What, because
I'm on the floor?

18:45.183 --> 18:46.084
No.

18:46.118 --> 18:47.085
No.

18:47.119 --> 18:48.120
No, no, no.

18:48.153 --> 18:49.154
I'm just medicating.

18:49.187 --> 18:50.122
Tating.

18:50.155 --> 18:52.525
Meditating.

18:52.559 --> 18:54.761
I just heard crying
or yelling.

18:54.794 --> 18:55.762
Chanting.

18:55.795 --> 18:56.529
Chanting?

18:56.563 --> 18:57.463
Yeah.

18:57.497 --> 18:59.499
Yeah?

18:59.532 --> 19:01.133
Just coming to check to make
sure everything's fine?

19:01.166 --> 19:02.401
Yeah.

19:02.435 --> 19:05.237
No, I always do like a little
chant for the gride and broom.

19:05.270 --> 19:08.140
Before the first dance.

19:08.173 --> 19:11.109
How do you mean?

19:11.143 --> 19:14.212
Oh, you know,
like a chant.

19:14.246 --> 19:16.516
Yeah, no, I don't.

19:16.549 --> 19:18.183
Yeah, just sort of...

19:19.018 --> 19:27.827
Close my eyes and go

19:27.860 --> 19:32.832
Chanting...

19:32.865 --> 19:34.701
Which obviously
means something.

19:34.734 --> 19:35.501
Unity.

19:35.535 --> 19:36.469
Yeah.

19:36.502 --> 19:41.273
Yeah. It means unity
in that they're now one.

19:41.306 --> 19:43.443
And yet they're two.

19:43.476 --> 19:47.145
So, really it's about being
strong enough

19:47.179 --> 19:51.517
to make one one
out of two ones.

19:51.551 --> 19:53.720
And yet still be two.

19:53.753 --> 19:54.554
Yeah.

19:54.587 --> 19:56.388
Makes sense.

19:56.421 --> 19:58.423
Totally get it.

19:58.458 --> 19:59.324
You do?

19:59.358 --> 20:00.593
Yeah.

20:00.627 --> 20:03.830
It's... like a building.

20:03.863 --> 20:05.698
It's only as strong
as its weakest pillar.

20:05.732 --> 20:07.667
Yeah, but is that true?

20:07.700 --> 20:10.268
Because it seems to me that
if you have enough pillars,

20:10.302 --> 20:12.204
like say you're the Acropolis,

20:12.237 --> 20:15.775
I think you could get away
with one crappy pillar.

20:15.808 --> 20:16.876
Sure.

20:16.909 --> 20:22.482
Except for earthquakes,
hurricanes, strong winds...

20:22.515 --> 20:23.315
Aliens.

20:23.348 --> 20:25.217
Well, we can't do much
about that.

20:25.250 --> 20:27.219
But you make a good point.

20:27.252 --> 20:29.421
One in which I happen
to believe in.

20:30.490 --> 20:32.925
Uh... what-what point
is that?

20:32.959 --> 20:36.194
Well, you can't be useful
in a two

20:36.228 --> 20:39.197
until you figure yourself
out as a one.

20:40.733 --> 20:41.734
Hmm.

20:42.969 --> 20:44.236
Cocktail?

20:44.269 --> 20:45.872
Oh, I'm fine, thanks.

20:45.905 --> 20:47.205
Well, here's to me.

20:47.239 --> 20:48.608
That was brilliant.

20:48.641 --> 20:49.509
But you're right.

20:49.542 --> 20:50.877
No time for cocktails.

20:50.910 --> 20:58.551
The two ones must waltz
so this one one must play.

20:58.584 --> 20:59.686
Ok.

21:03.990 --> 21:05.223
Alrighty.

21:05.257 --> 21:06.492
Hey.

21:06.526 --> 21:08.594
Don't you need this?

21:10.029 --> 21:12.665
Or you chant the waltz, too?

21:12.699 --> 21:14.500
Sometimes.

21:28.748 --> 21:30.282
I'm not pornophobic.

21:34.554 --> 21:36.022
<i>All men look at dirty pictures.</i>

21:36.055 --> 21:39.257
Oh, Jeff.

21:39.291 --> 21:41.627
Yes, yes, give it to me good.

21:41.661 --> 21:43.930
<i>You're pornophobic.</i>

21:43.963 --> 21:47.567
<i>I cannot drink her blood,
she's pornophobic.</i>

21:47.600 --> 21:48.801
<i>Am I not enough?</i>

21:48.835 --> 21:51.604
<i>Looks like she's suffering
from stage four pornophobia.</i>

21:51.637 --> 21:53.940
Say something racy.

21:53.973 --> 21:55.441
<i>It's a word.</i>

21:55.475 --> 21:56.809
Just say it already.

21:56.843 --> 21:58.044
Pornophobic.

21:58.077 --> 21:59.045
<i>Jeff left me.</i>

21:59.078 --> 22:00.780
<i>Pornophobic.</i>

22:00.813 --> 22:03.983
<i>Today we gather here
to remember Lucy Neal,</i>

22:04.016 --> 22:08.286
<i>who died alone from pornophobia.</i>

22:08.320 --> 22:11.691
<i>She died in the house she
inherited from her grandmother</i>

22:11.724 --> 22:15.895
<i>that she was only able to
fill with unfinished lists,</i>

22:15.928 --> 22:16.996
<i>not love.</i>

22:17.029 --> 22:18.931
You're pornophobic!

22:37.884 --> 22:38.885
Ok.

22:45.124 --> 22:47.460
<i>Sexpressions of Lust?</i>

22:47.493 --> 22:48.895
<i>Please.</i>

22:54.634 --> 22:57.570
<i>Madame Mischief's
Boudoir Secrets.</i>

22:57.603 --> 22:59.639
<i>Maybe it's a historical fiction?</i>

22:59.672 --> 23:01.841
<i>And who doesn't like secrets?</i>

23:02.508 --> 23:05.011
<i>Better get one more for back-up.</i>

23:06.145 --> 23:08.681
Bad Sally.

23:08.714 --> 23:10.583
That can't be right.

23:44.416 --> 23:45.718
Oh god.

24:03.135 --> 24:04.904
Faylene springs from the house

24:04.937 --> 24:07.573
as Michele passionately
gives chase.

24:07.607 --> 24:09.742
<i>Running for her life, Michele
grabs Faylene's wrist</i>

24:09.775 --> 24:15.014
<i>and twirls her until he backs
her into an erect pillar.</i>

24:15.047 --> 24:16.949
<i>He could almost taste
her ruby lips</i>

24:16.983 --> 24:21.988
<i>but Faylene thrusts her knee
into Michele, spins him around.</i>

24:22.021 --> 24:23.022
<i>Seizing the moment,</i>

24:23.055 --> 24:24.657
<i>Faylene pulls out a hidden
pistol sheathed</i>

24:24.690 --> 24:27.894
<i>on her thigh and pulls it
up to his chin.</i>

24:29.929 --> 24:31.564
<i>And then stops.</i>

24:38.905 --> 24:41.007
<i>Michele takes one strong finger</i>

24:41.040 --> 24:42.975
<i>and slowly drags
the pistol downwards.</i>

24:43.009 --> 24:44.944
<i>Faylene watches in wonder
as the cold steel surrenders</i>

24:44.977 --> 24:47.412
<i>to its final destination.</i>

24:47.880 --> 24:49.414
<i>Michele's manhood.</i>

24:50.483 --> 24:54.654
<i>Michele walks his finger across
the barrel and cocks the gun.</i>

24:54.687 --> 24:58.024
<i>Faylene knows what she wants
and she decides to take it.</i>

25:11.704 --> 25:13.472
Whew.

25:25.651 --> 25:27.019
<i>Salt shaker is done.</i>

25:27.053 --> 25:29.021
<i>I can check that off my list.</i>

25:39.966 --> 25:41.968
Hello.

25:42.001 --> 25:46.105
We have chocolate,
mimosas, tissues, sympathy.

25:46.138 --> 25:47.673
Wait, why do you look
so good?

25:47.707 --> 25:48.941
Where did you get
those jeans?

25:48.975 --> 25:49.575
No reason.

25:49.608 --> 25:50.242
Nowhere.

25:50.276 --> 25:52.144
And pity's not why I called.

25:52.178 --> 25:53.913
I told you we need
When Harry Met Sally.

25:53.946 --> 25:54.780
Mmmhmm.

25:54.814 --> 25:56.015
You do chocolates,
I'm on cocktails.

25:56.048 --> 25:57.083
No, really.

25:57.116 --> 25:58.584
I'm fine.

25:58.617 --> 25:59.552
I am.

25:59.585 --> 26:01.087
For, I have renewed life purpose
in the form

26:01.120 --> 26:03.823
of a research project
with which I need your help.

26:04.857 --> 26:05.725
She said research.

26:05.758 --> 26:07.093
She called me for research.

26:07.126 --> 26:07.893
You're losing it.

26:09.929 --> 26:13.099
We're doing number two and the
train is leaving in one minute.

26:15.601 --> 26:18.704
Guys, do you think
I'm gonna need this?

26:20.072 --> 26:21.674
Best break-up ever.

26:21.707 --> 26:23.209
Oh god.

26:32.918 --> 26:37.223
This is your Nissan Leaf,
this is your Mercedes C Class,

26:37.256 --> 26:43.295
and this is the Maserati
of vibrators.

26:43.329 --> 26:48.134
A serious piece of equipment for
only the most experienced user.

26:48.634 --> 26:49.702
Oh.

26:49.735 --> 26:51.570
Sold.

26:52.571 --> 26:55.975
<i>Using it could desensitize
you to men forever.</i>

26:56.275 --> 26:57.743
<i>I'll take one.</i>

27:05.284 --> 27:06.152
<i>Hey, Luce!</i>

27:06.185 --> 27:08.220
<i>I found something for ya.</i>

27:08.954 --> 27:11.057
He doesn't say
irritating things,

27:11.090 --> 27:14.760
he's a feminist, doesn't watch
football, or fart.

27:14.794 --> 27:17.063
Well, none of them do at first.

27:25.871 --> 27:29.775
Can I help you
with that cock ring?

27:29.809 --> 27:30.776
No.

27:30.810 --> 27:31.777
No, I got this.

27:31.811 --> 27:33.312
I was just checking...

27:34.213 --> 27:35.614
Sure.

27:42.288 --> 27:44.023
<i>Everything alright over there?</i>

27:44.491 --> 27:49.028
Sorry, just um...
looking for...

27:50.796 --> 27:52.264
for a Mother's Day gift.

27:52.298 --> 27:53.399
Oh.

27:53.433 --> 27:55.301
You know, I was wondering
what a nice girl like you

27:55.334 --> 27:57.103
was doing in a place
like this.

27:57.136 --> 27:59.738
I could ask you
the same thing.

27:59.772 --> 28:01.207
Go ahead.

28:03.443 --> 28:07.346
What's a nice girl like you
doing in a place like this?

28:08.013 --> 28:08.948
Oh...

28:12.051 --> 28:12.985
Oh!

28:13.018 --> 28:13.919
Busy day you got there.

28:13.953 --> 28:14.753
Oh-

28:14.787 --> 28:15.788
Uh, it's amazing
you have the time

28:15.821 --> 28:20.292
with all the violin playing
and the chanting.

28:20.326 --> 28:21.727
Of course you remember me.

28:21.760 --> 28:23.729
It's not every day I run
into a beautiful girl

28:23.762 --> 28:26.999
with such a propensity
for crouching.

28:27.900 --> 28:31.137
<i>Did he actually just use
the word "propensity"?</i>

28:33.706 --> 28:35.074
Oh hey.

28:35.875 --> 28:37.343
Adopted this puppy.

28:38.244 --> 28:40.045
And breakfast is ready.

28:41.213 --> 28:43.115
And the dishes are done.

28:44.451 --> 28:46.952
Hey, you're the best man
from the wedding

28:46.986 --> 28:48.287
with the pooping horse?

28:48.320 --> 28:50.856
Oh, yeah, I was just
a groomsman.

28:50.890 --> 28:52.825
Oh, well, I'm Nessa.

28:52.858 --> 28:54.293
I was a part of the quartet.

28:54.326 --> 28:56.128
Oh, yeah. You guys
were great.

28:56.162 --> 28:57.796
Thank you.

28:57.830 --> 28:59.432
I play the cello.

28:59.466 --> 29:00.467
Um, yeah.

29:00.500 --> 29:02.968
It's, you know, the big one
between your legs?

29:03.002 --> 29:05.871
Lucy over here,
she plays the violin.

29:05.905 --> 29:08.107
So it's Lucy, is it?

29:08.140 --> 29:10.309
So fancy meeting you here.

29:10.342 --> 29:12.811
What're you doing?

29:12.845 --> 29:14.947
Oh yeah, um, good question.

29:14.980 --> 29:16.715
I'm looking for a Mother's
Day gift.

29:16.749 --> 29:18.751
Oh, really?

29:18.784 --> 29:20.052
Me too.

29:20.085 --> 29:23.822
I mean, I would never be here
for myself.

29:25.024 --> 29:26.459
Or would I?

29:26.493 --> 29:27.726
Nessa.

29:27.760 --> 29:30.763
Uh, I'm actually
an architect.

29:30.796 --> 29:32.031
Paul Goodwin works at my firm.

29:32.064 --> 29:33.265
Right.

29:33.299 --> 29:37.136
Yeah, I vaguely remember him
mentioning something like that.

29:37.169 --> 29:39.038
I'm ah, working on
a job upstairs

29:39.071 --> 29:40.339
to reconfigure
the office space.

29:40.372 --> 29:41.575
Oh.

29:41.608 --> 29:43.342
Not nearly as interesting as
what's going on on that list.

29:43.375 --> 29:44.176
Oh, no.

29:44.210 --> 29:48.080
This is purely a
research project.

29:48.113 --> 29:48.948
Yeah, honestly
I can't help it.

29:48.981 --> 29:53.953
I went to Harvard
so I'm research-y.

29:53.986 --> 29:54.987
Actually, that's where
I met Paul.

29:55.020 --> 29:56.121
Really?

29:56.155 --> 29:59.058
You're using the H-bomb
on the best man?

29:59.091 --> 29:59.858
I just can't.

29:59.892 --> 30:00.859
I'm gonna go talk
to Priscilla.

30:00.893 --> 30:03.062
And wha the hell is up
with your lips, girl?

30:06.332 --> 30:08.167
I'm Grant.

30:08.200 --> 30:09.768
Who works here?

30:10.269 --> 30:11.971
Did I hear you say you
work here?

30:13.372 --> 30:15.374
Why, yes he does.

30:17.042 --> 30:19.111
So does she.

30:19.144 --> 30:21.514
I just wanna find out
if this works.

30:21.947 --> 30:26.085
Actually, sir, I am very
familiar with this product.

30:26.118 --> 30:28.020
It's one of my favourites.

30:28.053 --> 30:30.923
In fact, I've got it on
right now.

30:31.290 --> 30:33.058
What do you mean,
you're wearing it now?

30:33.092 --> 30:34.494
On what?

30:34.527 --> 30:36.161
On my lips.

30:36.195 --> 30:37.396
You put it on your lips?

30:37.430 --> 30:42.268
Uh, Luce, I don't think you put
erection cream on your lips.

30:42.968 --> 30:44.136
Oh my god.

30:45.838 --> 30:46.972
Oh.

30:47.507 --> 30:49.041
Excuse me?

30:49.074 --> 30:51.243
Do these come in extra large?

30:55.881 --> 30:58.884
Got you some ice
from the cafe.

30:58.917 --> 31:00.219
Thanks.

31:02.154 --> 31:08.027
Yeah, I thought your lips
looked a little...

31:08.060 --> 31:10.129
You got a chant for
this sort of thing?

31:11.297 --> 31:12.499
Woah.

31:15.635 --> 31:17.236
Can I have your number?

31:18.037 --> 31:19.138
You want my number?

31:19.171 --> 31:20.473
Yeah.

31:22.341 --> 31:23.576
Wait, really?

31:23.610 --> 31:26.145
I have a gig you might
be interested in playing.

31:26.945 --> 31:28.347
That's awesome.

31:29.014 --> 31:31.984
I'll um, I'll wait out here.

31:36.556 --> 31:37.590
Bye.

31:56.208 --> 31:59.211
So his dad co-chairs this annual
insurance commissioner's dinner

31:59.244 --> 32:01.146
and he wants you and me
to walk around

32:01.180 --> 32:03.082
and do the wandering
minstrel thing.

32:03.115 --> 32:04.484
First the wedding
and now this?

32:04.517 --> 32:05.984
Is he your new booking agent?

32:06.018 --> 32:07.953
Excuse me, why not all of us?

32:07.986 --> 32:10.956
Uh, I don't know, but you did
make it a point to tell him

32:10.989 --> 32:12.659
that your legs are pretty
occupied while you play.

32:13.593 --> 32:14.494
Will he be there?

32:14.527 --> 32:15.928
<i>He didn't say.</i>

32:15.961 --> 32:18.997
So, with the exception
of the H-bomb incident,

32:19.031 --> 32:20.999
and putting erection cream
on your lips,

32:21.033 --> 32:22.569
I'd say this was
very successful.

32:22.602 --> 32:25.137
You had a nice conversation
with a handsome man,

32:25.170 --> 32:29.676
we got a gig out of nowhere,
and you got Burt.

33:21.193 --> 33:22.495
Hmm.

33:29.134 --> 33:31.638
You know, after one week of
being broken up with Jeff

33:31.671 --> 33:37.009
after four years of dating and I
cannot believe how great I feel.

33:37.042 --> 33:40.312
Well, what I can't believe is
that we're actually doing this.

33:40.345 --> 33:43.315
Alright, Jersey, how we doin'?

33:43.348 --> 33:45.452
All six of you.

33:45.485 --> 33:46.619
Alright, first thing's first.

33:46.653 --> 33:47.587
I'm gonna go grab us
some drinks.

33:47.620 --> 33:51.023
Alright, now for the sexiest
identical twins

33:51.056 --> 33:53.158
with the hottest dance moves.

33:53.192 --> 33:56.195
Everybody give it up
for Cherry and

33:56.228 --> 33:58.997
♪ ...Dallas. ♪

33:59.298 --> 34:00.265
Dallas!

34:04.504 --> 34:06.639
<i>Hey Wes, can I trouble you
for two beers, mate?</i>

34:06.673 --> 34:07.674
<i>Pretend like you don't
know me.</i>

34:07.707 --> 34:09.107
Brilliant.

34:10.175 --> 34:11.444
Did he say Cherry and Dallas?

34:11.478 --> 34:14.045
You know, this is not
what I expected.

34:14.079 --> 34:14.481
Shh.

34:14.514 --> 34:15.380
Why?

34:15.414 --> 34:16.683
Are you afraid I'm gonna
wake them up?

34:16.716 --> 34:17.717
Oh, come on.

34:17.750 --> 34:19.719
They're performers and
you're talking over them.

34:19.752 --> 34:21.018
Don't be rude.

34:21.053 --> 34:22.087
It's disrespectful.

34:22.120 --> 34:22.688
I'm just saying.

34:22.722 --> 34:23.388
Hi, Cynthia.

34:23.422 --> 34:24.524
Loving the hair.

34:24.556 --> 34:25.625
How are you doing tonight?

34:25.658 --> 34:26.358
Hi.

34:26.391 --> 34:27.092
Thank you.

34:27.125 --> 34:28.293
Oh, it's a little cold
in here.

34:28.327 --> 34:28.994
Can I-

34:29.027 --> 34:29.696
Actually, we're totally fine.

34:29.728 --> 34:31.063
Why don't you keep the change?

34:31.096 --> 34:31.764
You know what?

34:31.797 --> 34:32.764
Throw that in for good measure.

34:32.799 --> 34:34.233
Don't embarrass me.

34:34.266 --> 34:36.368
Embarrassment's the least
of your problems.

34:36.400 --> 34:38.070
Ok, I need to level with you.

34:38.103 --> 34:39.338
It's not cold in here.

34:39.371 --> 34:40.405
It's optimal.

34:40.440 --> 34:42.139
Get with the program.

34:43.743 --> 34:45.110
Where are you going?

34:45.377 --> 34:46.612
Getting with the program.

34:46.646 --> 34:47.647
Don't do that!

34:47.679 --> 34:49.313
Lucy, come back, please.

34:50.248 --> 34:51.183
Hi.

34:51.216 --> 34:52.619
Your wife didn't send me here
to spy on you,

34:52.652 --> 34:53.820
I promise.

34:53.853 --> 34:55.152
Don't worry.

35:02.094 --> 35:06.031
<i>I wonder how these girls stay
in such good shape.</i>

35:07.132 --> 35:08.100
Quick question for you.

35:08.133 --> 35:12.472
Do you do pilates or...
oh, wow.

35:14.674 --> 35:17.276
Oh, nice, Luce.

35:17.309 --> 35:19.044
Thank you so much.

35:29.822 --> 35:31.123
<i>Wait a second.</i>

35:33.125 --> 35:35.762
<i>She is totally thinking
about her shopping list.</i>

35:35.795 --> 35:37.162
Ha!

35:39.899 --> 35:41.300
Woo!

36:10.295 --> 36:11.263
Oh.

36:13.833 --> 36:14.801
Ok.

36:23.810 --> 36:26.446
I'm just gonna
see what-

36:26.479 --> 36:27.379
She's trying to take my money!

36:27.412 --> 36:29.381
No, I can't make change?

36:30.248 --> 36:31.316
No, you did not.

36:31.350 --> 36:32.652
What were you thinking?

36:32.685 --> 36:34.887
As pleasing as her
vagina thrusts were,

36:34.921 --> 36:37.155
it just-it was not
a $20 kind of happy.

36:37.189 --> 36:39.525
Welcome to the Pleasure
Palace Party.

36:39.559 --> 36:42.294
We got the dildos,
we got the vibrators,

36:42.327 --> 36:45.665
so look around,
don't be shy.

36:45.698 --> 36:48.233
If you wanna get to the top
of the mountain

36:48.266 --> 36:49.869
you gotta go equipped.

36:49.902 --> 36:51.203
Oh.

36:52.204 --> 36:55.475
I did learn one very important
thing at the strip club.

36:55.508 --> 36:57.409
If naked enough it
doesn't matter

36:57.443 --> 36:58.878
if you can actually dance.

36:58.911 --> 37:01.179
Oh, I know what these are.

37:01.213 --> 37:02.849
People use these for meditating.

37:03.382 --> 37:05.885
No, those are Ben-Wa balls.

37:05.918 --> 37:07.520
50 Shades?

37:07.553 --> 37:08.521
Book two?

37:08.554 --> 37:10.188
Ben who?

37:10.723 --> 37:13.459
You take two of those,
you stick 'em up your lady,

37:13.493 --> 37:17.195
and just hold them for
a couple of hours, ok?

37:17.897 --> 37:19.398
Wait, what?

37:19.432 --> 37:20.099
Oh my god.

37:20.133 --> 37:21.901
Those are for Kegel exercises.

37:21.934 --> 37:24.202
You could do 'em in the car.

37:24.671 --> 37:26.873
Shit, I'm doing them right now.

37:26.906 --> 37:29.909
Experience intense natural
pleasure as each weighted ball

37:29.942 --> 37:31.711
rolls and moves with you
to give you

37:31.744 --> 37:35.448
a mind-blowing
internal massage.

37:35.481 --> 37:40.887
Now, you're gonna sculpt
a banana into a penis

37:40.920 --> 37:42.855
with your teeth.

37:46.358 --> 37:47.292
Catch that!

37:47.325 --> 37:49.394
Oh yeah, get that banana.

37:49.429 --> 37:52.397
<i>Well, I'll never look at a
banana the same way again.</i>

37:52.799 --> 37:54.399
<i>And neither will Paul.</i>

37:54.667 --> 37:55.935
<i>Sex toy party.</i>

37:55.968 --> 37:56.936
<i>Check.</i>

38:17.790 --> 38:18.958
Wait, why'd you stop?

38:18.991 --> 38:21.594
Uh, nothing.

38:21.627 --> 38:22.695
Nothing.

38:22.729 --> 38:25.965
I think I just... I really need
to go to the bathroom.

38:25.998 --> 38:26.866
Oh my, well go!

38:26.899 --> 38:28.735
It's right down there.

38:30.536 --> 38:33.973
I don't think I can
make it that far.

38:34.006 --> 38:34.941
Oh god.

38:34.974 --> 38:35.842
It's gonna come out.

38:35.875 --> 38:36.709
What is?

38:41.413 --> 38:42.347
Not a word.

38:42.615 --> 38:43.883
Not a word.

38:44.550 --> 38:46.351
Uh-uh.

38:47.419 --> 38:48.554
Ok.

38:48.588 --> 38:49.287
Oh.

38:49.321 --> 38:49.989
Oh!

38:50.022 --> 38:51.356
I don't think I can bend over.

38:51.389 --> 38:52.558
Because there's a second one?

38:52.592 --> 38:52.992
Three.

38:53.025 --> 38:53.960
Oh!

38:53.993 --> 38:54.727
There are three more.

38:54.761 --> 38:56.929
I bought two boxes.

38:57.563 --> 38:58.831
I see.

38:58.865 --> 38:59.832
For Kegels.

38:59.866 --> 39:01.366
Say no more.

39:03.970 --> 39:05.204
I need you to pick it up.

39:05.238 --> 39:07.372
You know, I didn't think there
were limits to our friendship.

39:07.405 --> 39:08.674
I realize it's just not true.

39:08.708 --> 39:09.942
Oh, this is not funny.

39:09.976 --> 39:10.810
It's not funny, ok?

39:10.843 --> 39:13.513
I only wore these
to a work function

39:13.546 --> 39:15.715
because I knew we would
be standing for three hours

39:15.748 --> 39:18.885
and, you know,
I wanted to tone.

39:20.987 --> 39:22.021
Stop!

39:22.054 --> 39:23.055
Stop, ok?

39:23.089 --> 39:25.057
If you make me laugh another
ball will pop out.

39:25.091 --> 39:26.793
Oh god, I'm so...

39:26.826 --> 39:27.927
I need help here. Please.

39:27.960 --> 39:29.495
Ok, ok. Let's go.

39:33.065 --> 39:33.800
What was that?

39:33.833 --> 39:35.001
I don't know.

39:35.034 --> 39:37.737
When I walk my legs just
sort of rub together

39:37.770 --> 39:39.038
and I'm already so, so-

39:39.071 --> 39:40.740
oh my god, I might-

39:40.773 --> 39:41.373
Hallelujah?

39:41.406 --> 39:42.108
Yeah.

39:42.141 --> 39:44.342
Ok, we're gonna
have to risk it.

39:44.376 --> 39:45.912
Lucy, if you do this
while holding my hand

39:45.945 --> 39:47.547
this friendship will
never be the same.

39:47.580 --> 39:49.381
Ladies, you look like
you're having a good night.

39:49.414 --> 39:50.917
Some of us more than others.

39:50.950 --> 39:51.918
Hi.

39:51.951 --> 39:52.952
What're you doing here?

39:52.985 --> 39:54.386
Oh, seeing my dad.

39:54.419 --> 39:56.589
He's on the board
with the trust.

39:56.989 --> 39:58.423
It's irrelevant.

39:58.457 --> 39:59.458
Now I'm seeing you.

39:59.492 --> 40:00.960
Have you met Priscilla?

40:00.993 --> 40:01.861
No, how are you?

40:01.894 --> 40:02.895
The leader of our quartet.

40:02.929 --> 40:05.898
My dear friend, who always
comes to my rescue.

40:05.932 --> 40:07.633
Oh, you need a lot of that?

40:07.667 --> 40:09.602
No, not at all,
but even still,

40:09.635 --> 40:12.038
she's just always waiting
for the other ball to drop.

40:12.071 --> 40:14.339
I mean shoe.

40:16.108 --> 40:17.610
Is it hot in here?

40:17.643 --> 40:18.578
Yeah, it is.

40:18.611 --> 40:19.779
Hmm.

40:19.812 --> 40:23.082
Um, I see someone that I...

40:23.115 --> 40:24.517
I don't see anyone.

40:24.550 --> 40:26.752
I'm just getting
out of the way.

40:29.455 --> 40:30.556
Are you tired?

40:30.590 --> 40:31.389
Am I tired?

40:31.423 --> 40:33.025
Yeah, you seem a bit
out of breath.

40:33.059 --> 40:34.026
Mmm-mmm.

40:34.060 --> 40:35.027
Mmm-mmm.

40:35.061 --> 40:38.064
No, I just sort of get
that way when I play.

40:38.097 --> 40:39.165
Oh, I get it.

40:39.198 --> 40:41.067
You're amazing.

40:42.735 --> 40:43.870
Sweet Jesus.

40:44.136 --> 40:45.504
Oh, what was that?

40:45.538 --> 40:46.038
Hmm?

40:46.072 --> 40:47.173
That.

40:47.206 --> 40:51.077
No, my back just gets that way
when I stand and play.

40:51.110 --> 40:52.377
Alright.

40:54.547 --> 40:55.648
Are you cold?

40:55.681 --> 40:56.414
Mmmhmm.

40:56.449 --> 40:57.049
Yeah.

40:57.083 --> 40:58.117
Oh, let's get you moving.

40:58.150 --> 40:58.918
Oh.

40:58.951 --> 41:00.019
Come on.

41:04.957 --> 41:06.492
Ah.

41:06.926 --> 41:07.960
You ok?

41:07.994 --> 41:09.028
Yeah.

41:09.061 --> 41:10.563
Yeah.

41:10.596 --> 41:12.131
Just warming up a little.

41:14.166 --> 41:15.835
If I didn't know better,

41:15.868 --> 41:17.203
your lips look beautifully
deflated this evening.

41:21.674 --> 41:24.010
Women don't usually
find me funny.

41:24.510 --> 41:26.746
It's my pleasure.

41:27.013 --> 41:28.014
Truly.

41:28.915 --> 41:29.682
Oh.

41:30.716 --> 41:31.784
Oh.

41:32.985 --> 41:34.453
Oh, what was that?

41:34.487 --> 41:35.154
What was what?

41:35.187 --> 41:36.489
Something just hit my foot.

41:36.522 --> 41:37.123
Is that a bird?

41:37.156 --> 41:38.124
There's a bird?

41:39.225 --> 41:41.060
Nope. Nope.

41:41.093 --> 41:42.194
Sorry, my mistake.

41:42.228 --> 41:42.929
Weird.

41:42.962 --> 41:43.996
Anyway.

41:44.030 --> 41:44.897
Hmm?

41:44.931 --> 41:45.898
I was thinking...

41:45.932 --> 41:46.465
Yeah?

41:46.499 --> 41:47.466
If you're not too busy-

41:47.500 --> 41:48.034
Never.

41:48.067 --> 41:48.834
Or too hot.

41:48.868 --> 41:49.468
Would you like to-

41:49.502 --> 41:50.169
Yes.

41:50.202 --> 41:50.937
Have dinner with me?

41:50.970 --> 41:52.238
Dear god, yes!

42:03.082 --> 42:04.884
So you call me up out of
the blue to ask me

42:04.917 --> 42:05.885
how good you were in bed?

42:05.918 --> 42:06.686
Mmmhmm.

42:06.719 --> 42:07.687
Out of a percentage
out of 100.

42:07.720 --> 42:11.824
But if you must, I will accept
a letter grade.

42:14.660 --> 42:16.028
Did you meet someone?

42:16.062 --> 42:16.896
What?

42:16.929 --> 42:17.830
No.

42:18.097 --> 42:18.898
No.

42:18.931 --> 42:19.699
I was just wondering-

42:19.732 --> 42:21.033
You did.

42:21.067 --> 42:24.103
You're seeing someone.

42:24.136 --> 42:25.237
Yeah, I am.

42:25.271 --> 42:26.038
I'm sorry.

42:26.072 --> 42:27.039
It's very new-

42:27.073 --> 42:27.673
No, no.

42:27.707 --> 42:29.208
It's a-I'm relieved, ok?

42:29.241 --> 42:34.947
'Cause I'm... I'm also seeing
someone else, too.

42:34.981 --> 42:35.815
You are?

42:35.848 --> 42:37.083
Yeah.

42:37.116 --> 42:37.750
Huh.

42:37.783 --> 42:39.018
Wow.

42:41.287 --> 42:42.221
Halloween.

42:42.254 --> 42:42.788
Yeah.

42:42.822 --> 42:44.623
Right after we broke up.

42:44.657 --> 42:48.227
Oh, or is that how she dresses
all the time?

42:48.260 --> 42:49.996
That's funny.

42:50.029 --> 42:52.064
I miss your sense of humour.

42:52.865 --> 42:54.767
Is that-I'm sorry, is that bad
for me to say

42:54.800 --> 42:56.902
that I miss something
about you?

42:59.138 --> 43:03.042
Uh... so, how are the-
how's your lists coming?

43:03.075 --> 43:05.077
Oh, very well, thank you.

43:05.111 --> 43:06.912
Yeah, after the porn thing

43:06.946 --> 43:09.615
I made a list that's
all about sex.

43:09.648 --> 43:15.621
And I recently went to both
a porn shop and a strip club.

43:18.124 --> 43:19.025
What?

43:19.058 --> 43:19.992
You-no, you're...

43:20.026 --> 43:21.327
you're hilarious.

43:21.360 --> 43:26.866
You see, this-you, us
being friends, this rocks.

43:26.899 --> 43:28.200
Yeah, it's great.

43:28.234 --> 43:31.003
Uh, but, sex with me.

43:31.037 --> 43:32.304
How was it?

43:32.338 --> 43:33.572
Oh, right.

43:33.606 --> 43:38.010
Um... it was fine.

43:38.044 --> 43:40.713
Jeff, literally choose
any letter.

43:40.746 --> 43:41.881
Ok, uh, geez.

43:41.914 --> 43:44.683
Uh... like A through F,
right?

43:44.717 --> 43:45.551
Yes.

43:46.185 --> 43:47.620
Ok.

43:47.653 --> 43:50.756
Uh, you are a...

43:54.994 --> 43:56.695
D.

43:56.729 --> 43:57.797
It's in room D.

43:57.830 --> 43:58.532
Are you sure?

43:58.564 --> 43:59.999
It doesn't say
"sex seminar".

44:00.032 --> 44:02.034
They're not gonna
call it that.

44:02.068 --> 44:03.002
It's this one.

44:03.035 --> 44:03.936
It has to be.

44:03.969 --> 44:05.237
Come on.

44:09.041 --> 44:13.746
Proficiency in sex is a must.

44:13.779 --> 44:18.751
It is the universal language
of humanity.

44:20.653 --> 44:21.687
You're tardy.

44:21.720 --> 44:22.354
Take a seat.

44:22.388 --> 44:23.389
Did you invite her?

44:23.422 --> 44:25.091
No.

44:25.124 --> 44:27.226
What could she have to learn?

44:28.528 --> 44:32.865
<i>To walk around speaking slang
is to be ignorant to one's self.</i>

44:32.898 --> 44:33.732
What're you doing here?

44:33.766 --> 44:35.301
I just came here to do research
for you.

44:35.334 --> 44:39.071
Number one miscommunication
slang speakers make

44:39.105 --> 44:42.975
is to think of it as a
male-centric activity.

44:43.008 --> 44:44.743
<i>That is, they think about
when men intercourse</i>

44:44.777 --> 44:47.413
with women that it's
all about the guy.

44:47.447 --> 44:48.314
Wrong!

44:48.347 --> 44:49.348
Wrong!!

44:49.381 --> 44:50.616
Wrong!

44:50.649 --> 44:53.953
From this moment on you will
refer to sexual communication

44:53.986 --> 44:59.091
as the gift that you will
give to only a worthy man,

44:59.125 --> 45:05.998
from you, the soon to be
supremely empowered woman!

45:13.973 --> 45:16.308
Oh, hit-oh wow,
you are tense.

45:16.342 --> 45:18.043
Yeah, I don't think
smacking it

45:18.077 --> 45:19.712
like that is part
of the technique.

45:19.745 --> 45:23.782
Kale, he left me for someone
his own age so I'm just-

45:23.816 --> 45:25.784
I can't deal with men right now.

45:25.818 --> 45:28.020
Oh, Nessa, I'm so sorry.

45:28.053 --> 45:29.989
Here.

45:30.022 --> 45:31.423
I'm gonna help you.

45:31.458 --> 45:33.259
Ok?

45:33.292 --> 45:37.163
It's like we're in Ghost
and you're my Patrick Swayze.

45:37.196 --> 45:41.000
Oh, of course you get
to be Demi Moore.

45:41.033 --> 45:43.068
It takes a village.

46:10.362 --> 46:13.232
Ok, so five weeks until my
audition for the Philharmonic-

46:13.265 --> 46:17.269
I'm not getting any better,
am I?

46:17.303 --> 46:19.872
No, you're really not.

46:19.905 --> 46:21.006
What?

46:21.040 --> 46:22.942
'Cause you're already a genius.

46:22.975 --> 46:24.977
Well, it's true,
and you know it.

46:25.010 --> 46:30.883
You just gotta get
out of there.

46:30.916 --> 46:33.953
Did you know that the female
ferret will die if she goes

46:33.986 --> 46:36.188
into heat and can't find
a mate?

46:36.222 --> 46:38.757
Jeff was the rodent,
not you.

46:38.791 --> 46:39.992
What about the best man?

46:40.025 --> 46:40.960
Groomsman.

46:40.993 --> 46:42.094
Hasn't he called?

46:42.127 --> 46:43.862
You really should ask Paul
what his story is because-

46:43.896 --> 46:46.098
No. No, he did.

46:46.131 --> 46:48.133
We're going out on Saturday.

46:48.167 --> 46:48.968
You are?!

46:49.001 --> 46:49.902
Oh.

46:49.935 --> 46:50.402
That's wonderful!

46:50.437 --> 46:51.270
Oh.

46:51.303 --> 46:53.072
You're at a ten.

46:53.105 --> 46:54.306
Well, what are your plans?

46:54.340 --> 46:56.809
I mean, you could do
a dinner cruise.

46:56.842 --> 46:58.877
Oh, a hot air balloon.

46:58.911 --> 47:00.913
What is with you today?

47:00.946 --> 47:02.449
Nothing, I'm just happy
for you.

47:02.482 --> 47:05.351
Oh... what are those?

47:05.384 --> 47:07.052
Stan got me diamonds.

47:07.086 --> 47:08.354
Oh my god.

47:08.387 --> 47:10.089
Was it the seminar?

47:10.122 --> 47:13.125
I have a sex life again
after 27 years.

47:13.158 --> 47:16.262
Stan and I are doing it like
high school kids on prom night.

47:16.295 --> 47:18.797
Oh, so meaning it's over
in five minutes

47:18.831 --> 47:19.965
and you get nothing out of it.

47:19.999 --> 47:22.968
Except a bad reputation.

47:23.002 --> 47:24.403
Anyway, enough about me.

47:24.437 --> 47:26.071
Why aren't you thrilled
about the best man?

47:26.105 --> 47:27.206
I am.

47:27.239 --> 47:30.976
I... don't you think he's
a little out of my league?

47:31.010 --> 47:33.245
I'm not even gonna dignify
that question.

47:33.279 --> 47:35.881
You're just afraid to get back
on the horse.

47:35.914 --> 47:37.816
Lucy, it's like riding a bike.

47:37.850 --> 47:41.387
Or maybe a pogo stick.

47:41.420 --> 47:43.556
I'm just freaking out
because in my effort to be

47:43.590 --> 47:47.594
supremely empowered I insisted
on planning the date.

47:47.627 --> 47:50.896
And I've got nothing.

47:50.929 --> 47:54.099
Well, if you're interested,
Stan got us two tickets

47:54.133 --> 47:56.603
to the Dr. Becker taping
on Saturday night.

47:56.636 --> 47:57.936
VIP seats.

47:57.970 --> 47:59.271
Which is...?

47:59.305 --> 48:01.441
She's a sex expert.

48:01.474 --> 48:03.275
I showed Stan the list.

48:03.309 --> 48:05.077
He got very inspired.

48:05.110 --> 48:07.313
Anyway, if I promised to make it
worth his while

48:07.346 --> 48:11.016
I'm sure I can get him
to stay at home.

48:11.050 --> 48:15.054
Ok, if I promise to take
the tickets

48:15.087 --> 48:16.855
do you promise to never talk
about you and Stan

48:16.889 --> 48:19.526
sexually communicating
ever again?

48:19.559 --> 48:20.259
Deal.

48:20.292 --> 48:21.193
Ok.

48:21.226 --> 48:22.328
Can I just tell you one thing?

48:22.361 --> 48:23.128
Alright, yes.

48:23.162 --> 48:24.897
I'm gonna get my labia
tightened.

48:33.038 --> 48:35.874
What do you think about
oyster shooters?

48:35.908 --> 48:40.946
Mmm, aren't oysters more
of a third date kind of food?

48:40.979 --> 48:43.282
Yes, good point.

48:43.315 --> 48:45.084
It's not like you're taking me
to a sex show.

48:45.117 --> 48:47.886
Lecture by a progressive,

48:47.920 --> 48:50.523
world renowned researcher
who went to Yale.

48:50.557 --> 48:54.093
Which is definitely
not Harvard.

48:54.126 --> 48:56.228
But she happens to be discussing
human sexuality and I-

48:56.261 --> 48:59.131
I know, I know, consult
an expert is on your list.

48:59.164 --> 49:00.933
I'm messing with you.

49:00.966 --> 49:04.169
And just because we're going
to a lecture like this

49:04.203 --> 49:07.206
doesn't make me a sure thing,
you know.

49:07.239 --> 49:08.675
Me neither.

49:08.708 --> 49:10.309
Good.

49:10.342 --> 49:13.613
Wouldn't want you getting
the wrong idea.

49:13.646 --> 49:16.415
What idea might that be?

49:16.449 --> 49:19.385
I don't know, I just wouldn't
want you misinterpreting

49:19.418 --> 49:25.658
my list, 'cause I'm really
not that kind of girl.

49:25.692 --> 49:29.128
And what kind of girl
are you?

49:29.161 --> 49:33.265
That's for me to know
and for you to wonder.

49:36.503 --> 49:38.605
Ok, well now I'm gonna ask you
a bunch of things

49:38.638 --> 49:41.173
so I can make a meaningful
snap judgement about you

49:41.206 --> 49:42.174
without being distracted

49:42.207 --> 49:46.345
by all your charming,
attractive... you-ness.

49:46.378 --> 49:48.947
Is this where you ask me
for my tax return?

49:48.981 --> 49:50.450
'Cause I didn't bring it.

49:50.483 --> 49:52.685
Uh, no.

49:52.719 --> 49:55.455
I was just gonna ask you what
your favourite book was.

49:55.488 --> 49:57.055
Um, sorry.

49:57.089 --> 49:59.258
My last girlfriend did that
on the first date.

49:59.291 --> 50:03.128
And you still ended up
dating her?

50:03.162 --> 50:04.664
Oh.

50:04.697 --> 50:05.732
Alright, yeah.

50:05.765 --> 50:08.300
Your last girlfriend must have
been a supermodel.

50:08.333 --> 50:10.637
She was a model, yes,
but super, no.

50:10.670 --> 50:11.571
Definitely not.

50:11.604 --> 50:13.138
And she's certainly not
Harvard material.

50:13.172 --> 50:15.040
Ah.

50:15.073 --> 50:19.178
Well, as an artist, I do not
require financial documentation.

50:19.211 --> 50:21.113
Being well kept doesn't really
apply to me.

50:21.146 --> 50:24.049
And yet you seem to be
kept very well.

50:26.519 --> 50:27.454
That is corny.

50:29.154 --> 50:30.989
Uh, let's do the books.

50:31.023 --> 50:32.024
I have two.

50:32.057 --> 50:33.058
I also have two favourites.

50:33.091 --> 50:33.760
Ladies first.

50:33.793 --> 50:34.661
Nope.

50:34.694 --> 50:35.227
Huh?

50:35.260 --> 50:37.095
No. I asked you first.

50:37.129 --> 50:39.164
Revealing book love is
a very personal thing.

50:39.198 --> 50:40.165
I know.

50:40.199 --> 50:44.002
That's why it's my stock first
date question.

50:44.036 --> 50:47.172
It's gonna tell me everything
I need to know about you.

50:47.206 --> 50:49.642
Are you sure you wanna know?

50:49.676 --> 50:51.611
Yeah, you're right.

50:51.644 --> 50:54.379
It could be the end of something
good before it even starts.

50:54.413 --> 50:57.617
Or it could be the start of
something good that doesn't end.

50:59.586 --> 51:01.253
What the hell's
in this drink?

51:03.656 --> 51:04.657
Ok, alright.

51:04.691 --> 51:06.325
Let's just state our books.

51:06.358 --> 51:07.192
Yep.

51:07.226 --> 51:09.061
And let's get this ship
to sinking, ok?

51:09.094 --> 51:10.162
Please.

51:10.195 --> 51:11.029
Alright.

51:11.063 --> 51:12.030
Yeah. At the same time,
count of three?

51:12.064 --> 51:12.465
Yes.

51:12.499 --> 51:13.098
Alright.

51:13.131 --> 51:13.666
Ok.

51:13.700 --> 51:15.502
One, two, three.

51:15.535 --> 51:16.569
"Everything That Rises
Must Converge",

51:16.603 --> 51:17.804
and "The Story of Your Life."

51:17.837 --> 51:18.738
"The Story of Your Life"

51:18.771 --> 51:21.373
and "Everything That Rises
Must Converge".

51:22.241 --> 51:24.042
Well, you like them in
the wrong order.

51:24.076 --> 51:26.044
Yeah. It's definitely
not gonna work.

51:36.723 --> 51:38.591
This is the Dr. Becker show?

51:38.625 --> 51:40.158
Yeah. Hi, welcome.

51:40.192 --> 51:41.326
Hi.

51:41.360 --> 51:45.698
Oh, uh, will Dr. Becker
be out soon?

51:45.732 --> 51:48.200
That is Dr. Becker.

51:48.233 --> 51:49.067
Alright, let's get everybody
in their seats now-

51:49.101 --> 51:53.205
Wait, she's a Magna Cum
Laude Yale PhD?

51:53.238 --> 51:54.607
Follow me.

51:54.641 --> 51:56.709
Alright, ladies and gentlemen,
please take your seats.

51:56.743 --> 51:58.778
The show is about to start.

51:58.811 --> 52:03.248
Dr. Becker, you're on
in three, two...

52:05.117 --> 52:07.119
Ok.

52:07.152 --> 52:09.221
I am so sorry.
I had no idea-

52:09.254 --> 52:10.322
Are you kidding me?

52:10.355 --> 52:13.593
This is the most interesting
date I have ever gone on

52:13.626 --> 52:14.627
in my entire life.

52:14.661 --> 52:15.628
Welcome.

52:15.662 --> 52:20.165
Tonight's guest is both
a true pleasure to have

52:20.198 --> 52:23.469
and a departure from my usual
science-based approach

52:23.503 --> 52:25.805
to sexual enlightenment.

52:25.838 --> 52:28.608
Science was nothing like
this where I went to school.

52:28.641 --> 52:29.876
Really?

52:29.909 --> 52:32.144
I thought boarding schools were
known for sexual enlightenment.

52:32.177 --> 52:35.113
<i>Please help me welcome
Madam Swarovska,</i>

52:35.147 --> 52:37.249
world-renowned sexual psychic.

52:39.151 --> 52:40.053
What's a sexual psychic?

52:40.085 --> 52:42.354
Someone who can do
the pull and pray method

52:42.387 --> 52:44.256
of birth control?

52:45.658 --> 52:46.659
You snorted.

52:46.693 --> 52:47.894
Ok, I'm leaving.

52:47.927 --> 52:49.862
That one.

52:49.896 --> 52:51.330
She suffers.

52:51.363 --> 52:52.364
Oh?

52:57.169 --> 52:58.403
Oh.

52:58.438 --> 52:59.672
Madame Swarovska,

52:59.706 --> 53:02.341
can you explain to our audience
what it is that you're doing?

53:02.374 --> 53:03.910
And me, would be nice.

53:03.943 --> 53:07.379
I am assessing the aura.

53:07.412 --> 53:11.183
Seeing what colours
surround her.

53:11.216 --> 53:13.318
Sounds lovely.
Thank you.

53:13.352 --> 53:16.623
For most people, yes.
For you, no.

53:16.656 --> 53:19.391
For you, is grey.

53:19.424 --> 53:20.793
Grey?

53:20.827 --> 53:22.895
Are you saying that
she's sexually...

53:22.929 --> 53:24.196
Grey!

53:24.229 --> 53:25.665
Yes.

53:25.698 --> 53:30.168
Well, lucky for me
neutrals are in for fall.

53:30.202 --> 53:32.170
You know, we can go
like five minutes ago.

53:32.204 --> 53:33.205
No, no, this is awesome.

53:33.238 --> 53:34.073
This is great.

53:34.107 --> 53:36.208
How about we get you on
stage, Miss...?

53:36.241 --> 53:37.644
Uh, Lu...

53:38.945 --> 53:40.480
Lulu-bell.

53:41.514 --> 53:43.950
<i>Well, come on up
here, Lulu-bell,</i>

53:43.983 --> 53:46.653
so Madame Swarovska
can read you.

53:46.686 --> 53:47.920
Come on.

53:48.921 --> 53:50.590
You're safe.

53:53.960 --> 53:59.732
Yes, the grey one is in deep
struggle with the sex.

53:59.766 --> 54:01.333
I often discuss a condition

54:01.366 --> 54:04.202
called sexual attention
deficit disorder.

54:04.236 --> 54:05.538
SADD.

54:05.571 --> 54:07.507
Sad, for short.

54:07.540 --> 54:09.742
Which involves frequent
mental wanderings

54:09.776 --> 54:13.311
of a non-sexual nature
during intercourse.

54:13.345 --> 54:14.480
Might that be what-

54:14.514 --> 54:17.917
Yes, but also lack
of experience.

54:19.485 --> 54:24.791
Oh, trust me, I-I have plenty
of experience.

54:27.493 --> 54:29.394
The cards say no.

54:29.429 --> 54:30.697
No, I assure you.

54:30.730 --> 54:32.397
I know what I'm doing.

54:32.432 --> 54:33.933
The cards say no.

54:37.302 --> 54:38.838
Oh, I see.

54:38.871 --> 54:42.909
You are very old when
you are first having sex.

54:42.942 --> 54:44.877
Surely you mean old enough.

54:44.911 --> 54:46.879
No, I mean old.

54:46.913 --> 54:48.548
Oh.

54:49.247 --> 54:53.453
Oh, old is why you are only
having sex with four people?

54:53.486 --> 54:55.287
Is that true?

54:55.320 --> 54:56.723
Four?

54:56.756 --> 54:57.657
No.

54:57.690 --> 54:58.491
No?

54:58.524 --> 54:59.158
Well, yeah.

54:59.192 --> 55:00.526
But what's wrong with that?

55:00.560 --> 55:02.862
Oh, one does not count.

55:02.895 --> 55:09.902
It ends uh, how you say...
prematurely.

55:13.906 --> 55:15.975
Oh, that one looks promising.

55:16.008 --> 55:19.979
Yeah, when is upright yes,
but for you is reverse.

55:20.012 --> 55:20.813
Oh.

55:20.847 --> 55:22.915
Oh.

55:22.949 --> 55:24.282
Grey one.

55:24.316 --> 55:25.084
Yeah?

55:25.118 --> 55:27.385
You're not having
the big booms?

55:27.419 --> 55:29.722
What?

55:29.756 --> 55:32.558
The big booms.

55:32.592 --> 55:34.994
The rolling thunder.

55:35.027 --> 55:37.530
The crotch magic,
you know?

55:37.563 --> 55:39.565
Like, oh yeah, baby.

55:39.599 --> 55:40.398
I love it!

55:40.433 --> 55:41.266
You know?

55:41.299 --> 55:42.969
Like, woah Nealy gets
really crazy,

55:43.002 --> 55:44.369
that kind of sex.

55:44.402 --> 55:46.973
Like uh, like magic time.

55:47.006 --> 55:48.306
Like crotch magic.

55:48.340 --> 55:49.809
Blast it off.

55:49.842 --> 55:51.644
Blast up inside, you know?

55:51.677 --> 55:53.045
I can't handle it anymore!

55:53.079 --> 55:54.680
Like... woo!

55:54.714 --> 55:55.681
This type of thing.

55:55.715 --> 55:56.916
What-how you call it?

55:56.949 --> 56:00.953
She sees... um,
you don't orgasm.

56:00.987 --> 56:02.889
I got it. Thanks.

56:02.922 --> 56:05.958
Oh, but you're giving booms
to yourself sometime,

56:05.992 --> 56:06.926
that's good.

56:06.959 --> 56:08.060
That's ok.

56:08.094 --> 56:09.028
That's something, huh?

56:12.364 --> 56:12.999
That's nice.

56:13.032 --> 56:14.934
You keep that going, ok?

56:15.701 --> 56:18.805
Now I'm going to see about
the one you come here with.

56:18.838 --> 56:19.672
This guy over here.

56:19.705 --> 56:20.540
Oh, oh.

56:20.573 --> 56:21.941
Hey, now.

56:27.613 --> 56:28.548
This is really lucky.

56:28.581 --> 56:30.917
The devil's card in reverse
is representing

56:30.950 --> 56:33.920
like breaking freedom
from restraint.

56:33.953 --> 56:37.690
This guy is going to give
you the big booms!

56:39.091 --> 56:40.459
Yes.

56:41.961 --> 56:45.965
Isn't that amazing how accurate
the Madame is?

56:59.111 --> 57:04.450
Well uh, thank you again
for a uh, revealing night.

57:04.483 --> 57:08.754
Once again, she was so not right
about anything she said.

57:08.788 --> 57:09.455
No.

57:09.488 --> 57:09.956
By the way.

57:09.989 --> 57:11.057
She's crazy.

57:11.090 --> 57:12.859
She said I rocked your world
when we barely even know

57:12.892 --> 57:14.927
each other, let alone have had,
you know, sex.

57:14.961 --> 57:16.062
Right?

57:16.095 --> 57:16.996
I know.

57:17.029 --> 57:18.264
Like, what was she even saying?

57:18.297 --> 57:23.669
That just me being close to you
I get like all... I don't know.

57:23.703 --> 57:24.503
Sorry, no.

57:24.537 --> 57:28.174
Look how in control I am
around you.

57:28.207 --> 57:30.142
Right.

57:31.177 --> 57:32.812
Anyway, yeah, she was wrong.

57:32.845 --> 57:34.747
She was crazy wrong.

57:35.081 --> 57:36.849
Who knows?

57:39.919 --> 57:42.989
Anyway, twice again,
for the official record,

57:43.022 --> 57:45.825
I had absolutely no idea
about tonight

57:45.858 --> 57:49.629
and I am so, so, so sorry.

57:49.662 --> 57:51.130
I'm really sorry.

57:51.163 --> 57:53.132
I'm not.

58:00.606 --> 58:01.474
Goodnight.

58:01.507 --> 58:02.842
Yeah.

58:02.875 --> 58:04.477
I swear you're going
to get me fired.

58:04.510 --> 58:07.013
Or even worse,
assigned to awful jobs.

58:07.046 --> 58:09.916
Grant's a pretty big deal
at the firm, you know.

58:09.949 --> 58:13.085
And you're a big deal to us,
Paul, but this isn't about you.

58:13.119 --> 58:14.620
Yet.

58:14.654 --> 58:16.923
The psychic didn't
say anything positive?

58:16.956 --> 58:18.758
Just that I wouldn't end
up alone.

58:18.791 --> 58:21.594
Well, that could just mean
she thinks you'll get a cat.

58:21.627 --> 58:22.395
What?

58:22.428 --> 58:23.663
Ok, let me paint a picture
for you.

58:23.696 --> 58:28.000
If Grant is the devil and not
even he can get lucky with her,

58:28.034 --> 58:30.703
then perhaps poor Luce
is destined to end up

58:30.736 --> 58:33.172
with a litter of cats.

58:33.205 --> 58:34.774
But seriously,
let's get back on point.

58:34.807 --> 58:36.042
How did you two leave things?

58:36.075 --> 58:37.777
Am I gonna have to avoid him
at the office?

58:37.810 --> 58:40.947
Can't hear you.
I'm shopping.

58:40.980 --> 58:43.549
Luce, quick question.

58:43.582 --> 58:45.785
Isn't this the section for girls
who do get kissed?

58:45.818 --> 58:46.585
Hey.

58:46.619 --> 58:47.720
Just so you know,

58:47.753 --> 58:49.055
he said he was gonna call this
weekend to make plans.

58:49.088 --> 58:50.056
And no, I'm in
the right section.

58:50.089 --> 58:50.890
Mmmhmm.

58:50.923 --> 58:54.193
Guys, I have to tell
you something.

58:54.226 --> 58:56.262
Good god, you're not preg-
how?

58:56.295 --> 58:57.096
What?

58:57.129 --> 58:57.730
No.

58:57.763 --> 58:58.965
The question would be who,

58:58.998 --> 59:01.934
since I can't even seem to get
a guy past the front porch.

59:01.968 --> 59:02.935
You know those jeans

59:02.969 --> 59:06.672
that make my ass look like
a sorority girl's?

59:08.307 --> 59:09.809
Here?

59:09.842 --> 59:10.910
We're going to
the women's section.

59:10.943 --> 59:12.278
Nope, not the women's.

59:12.311 --> 59:13.145
Men's?

59:13.179 --> 59:14.013
That's brilliant.

59:14.046 --> 59:15.014
Right here.

59:15.047 --> 59:16.849
In maternity.

59:17.516 --> 59:22.088
Look, they have this stretchy
stuff that goes over the stomach

59:22.121 --> 59:25.791
and just kinda smooths
everything out.

59:28.260 --> 59:30.229
I know, you think
I'm pathetic.

59:30.262 --> 59:31.330
No, no.

59:31.364 --> 59:33.733
I'm just trying to figure out
my size in women's.

59:49.682 --> 59:52.618
Who knew strings could accompany
threesome-type sex so well?

59:52.651 --> 59:54.120
I say we rehearse like this
all the time.

59:55.154 --> 59:57.089
I'm so surprised you're still
doing the list.

59:57.123 --> 59:58.157
I'm psyched.

59:58.190 --> 01:00:00.860
I've been labelled
sexually grey.

01:00:00.893 --> 01:00:02.328
It kinda solidified the mission.

01:00:02.361 --> 01:00:04.263
And I've been waiting for Grant
to call me all week

01:00:04.296 --> 01:00:07.800
so I figured I might as well
just watch my 25 films.

01:00:07.833 --> 01:00:09.035
Why are you waiting
for him to call?

01:00:09.068 --> 01:00:12.671
Why don't you call him?

01:00:12.705 --> 01:00:14.807
Anyway, so I had one of these
on when it came time

01:00:14.840 --> 01:00:16.942
to practise one day, so...

01:00:16.976 --> 01:00:17.877
Well, if it means anything,

01:00:17.910 --> 01:00:20.146
I've never heard you play
this good, girl.

01:00:20.179 --> 01:00:21.380
Don't be ridiculous.

01:00:21.414 --> 01:00:25.618
A month until the Philharmonic
auditions remember us when.

01:00:25.651 --> 01:00:26.652
Mmmhmm.

01:00:32.691 --> 01:00:34.627
Oh my god.
It's him.

01:00:34.660 --> 01:00:35.094
The best man?

01:00:35.127 --> 01:00:36.162
<i>Yeah.</i>

01:00:36.195 --> 01:00:37.129
Do I-what,
do I answer?

01:00:37.163 --> 01:00:37.763
No!

01:00:37.797 --> 01:00:39.665
No.

01:00:39.698 --> 01:00:41.000
Yes.

01:00:41.033 --> 01:00:42.802
I don't know.

01:00:42.835 --> 01:00:44.136
Ok, answer it or I will.

01:00:44.170 --> 01:00:45.971
I already suffered through
high school once.

01:00:46.005 --> 01:00:47.006
Ok.

01:00:47.740 --> 01:00:48.874
Ok.

01:00:50.209 --> 01:00:51.243
Hey.

01:00:51.277 --> 01:00:52.745
<i>Hey yourself.
It's Grant.</i>

01:00:52.778 --> 01:00:54.280
<i>Listen, sorry I haven't
called you...</i>

01:00:54.313 --> 01:00:56.148
"Hey"? The man of your dreams
calls and you say "hey"?

01:00:56.182 --> 01:00:57.783
Shh!

01:00:57.817 --> 01:00:59.652
Uh, me shush?

01:00:59.685 --> 01:01:01.053
No, sorry.
Not you.

01:01:01.087 --> 01:01:02.121
I'm with the quartet.

01:01:02.154 --> 01:01:03.856
Rehearsing some porn!

01:01:04.924 --> 01:01:05.991
Did she say you're
watching porn?

01:01:06.025 --> 01:01:06.692
<i>No.</i>

01:01:06.725 --> 01:01:07.326
<i>No, she did not.</i>

01:01:07.359 --> 01:01:09.161
She said "horn".

01:01:09.195 --> 01:01:11.897
Yeah, we're adding a French horn
to the group.

01:01:11.931 --> 01:01:14.100
Ah, well, I can't help you
with that.

01:01:14.133 --> 01:01:17.336
So um, you're working
on a Saturday?

01:01:17.369 --> 01:01:18.204
<i>Uh, listen.</i>

01:01:18.237 --> 01:01:19.338
<i>Sorry I haven't called
all week.</i>

01:01:19.371 --> 01:01:20.940
<i>I've been bloody busy
in non-stop meetings and-</i>

01:01:20.973 --> 01:01:22.041
He was out
of town all week.

01:01:22.074 --> 01:01:23.042
That's it.

01:01:23.075 --> 01:01:23.943
Woohoo!

01:01:23.976 --> 01:01:25.344
Oh, thank god.

01:01:25.377 --> 01:01:26.679
There it is.

01:01:27.079 --> 01:01:28.013
Oh!

01:01:29.449 --> 01:01:30.216
Oh, Paul, your ass.

01:01:30.249 --> 01:01:31.083
Turn it down!

01:01:31.117 --> 01:01:33.018
<i>Turn it down!</i>

01:01:34.153 --> 01:01:36.088
Sorry, Nessa just stubbed
her toe.

01:01:36.122 --> 01:01:37.022
Why me?

01:01:39.158 --> 01:01:40.092
Anyway, look.

01:01:40.126 --> 01:01:41.760
I know it's last minute
but I was thinking,

01:01:41.794 --> 01:01:43.095
if you wanted to go out-

01:01:43.129 --> 01:01:44.029
<i>I'd love to.</i>

01:01:44.063 --> 01:01:46.065
Yes. Whatever it is.

01:01:46.098 --> 01:01:46.966
So sorry!

01:01:48.200 --> 01:01:50.069
Not sorry.

01:02:30.209 --> 01:02:31.210
Ok. Ok.

01:02:31.243 --> 01:02:32.278
Here we go.

01:02:32.311 --> 01:02:33.846
Wait. Wait.

01:02:33.879 --> 01:02:35.080
What?

01:02:49.061 --> 01:02:49.496
Mmm-mmm.

01:02:49.529 --> 01:02:50.029
No?

01:02:50.062 --> 01:02:50.996
You want me to stop?

01:02:51.030 --> 01:02:52.432
What? No. Go.

01:02:52.465 --> 01:02:52.965
No?

01:02:52.998 --> 01:02:55.468
As in it's a no go?

01:02:55.502 --> 01:02:56.802
No. No. Keep going.

01:03:42.314 --> 01:03:44.451
The perfect pants
for you two.

01:03:57.930 --> 01:03:59.064
Hi.

01:03:59.098 --> 01:03:59.865
Hey.

01:03:59.898 --> 01:04:01.133
Sorry, I didn't mean
to wake you.

01:04:01.166 --> 01:04:03.135
Um, I was just gonna...

01:04:04.169 --> 01:04:06.105
Oh.

01:04:06.138 --> 01:04:06.939
Ok.

01:04:16.849 --> 01:04:18.017
I'll call you.

01:04:18.951 --> 01:04:20.185
Yeah.

01:04:34.534 --> 01:04:35.134
Oh my god.

01:04:35.167 --> 01:04:36.168
No! No!

01:04:36.201 --> 01:04:39.004
Grant! Wait!

01:04:39.038 --> 01:04:40.072
Shit.

01:04:41.106 --> 01:04:41.907
No. No.

01:04:41.940 --> 01:04:43.409
Grant! Wait!

01:04:44.176 --> 01:04:47.212
Grant? Grant!

01:04:47.246 --> 01:04:50.949
If it's about the porn
I can quit any time!

01:04:53.385 --> 01:04:54.186
What?

01:04:54.219 --> 01:04:57.122
So I watch porn.
Big fucking deal.

01:04:57.156 --> 01:04:58.424
As long as it's consensual.

01:04:58.458 --> 01:05:00.326
No judgement.

01:05:12.237 --> 01:05:14.106
Stupid.

01:05:14.139 --> 01:05:16.141
Useless!

01:05:17.677 --> 01:05:20.412
This tastes like crap!

01:05:22.147 --> 01:05:23.215
Disgusting!

01:05:23.248 --> 01:05:24.416
Ugh!

01:05:24.451 --> 01:05:25.618
Don't even work!

01:05:27.052 --> 01:05:28.455
Ugh!

01:05:33.392 --> 01:05:35.294
God, I can't believe this.

01:05:36.028 --> 01:05:37.162
And you.

01:06:38.056 --> 01:06:39.626
Stupid.

01:06:59.512 --> 01:07:02.615
Ugh, Phil's penthouse
is just so gorge.

01:07:02.649 --> 01:07:05.117
My boyfriend and I walked in
and he was all

01:07:05.150 --> 01:07:07.587
"this place owns the skyline".

01:07:07.620 --> 01:07:09.321
Well, it did take us about
a year to complete

01:07:09.354 --> 01:07:11.123
so you can imagine
what it cost.

01:07:11.156 --> 01:07:12.991
I don't do numbers.

01:07:13.025 --> 01:07:15.027
Me neither, but like how much?

01:07:15.060 --> 01:07:17.095
Anyway, if you thought
the penthouse is impressive

01:07:17.129 --> 01:07:20.399
you really ought to see
his place in the Hamptons.

01:07:20.433 --> 01:07:22.134
I can't wait to own multiple
homes in

01:07:22.167 --> 01:07:23.670
which I don't actually live.

01:07:23.703 --> 01:07:26.205
My boyfriend and I
love the Hams.

01:07:26.238 --> 01:07:28.173
The Hams?

01:07:28.207 --> 01:07:29.374
Is that what we're calling
it now?

01:07:29.408 --> 01:07:31.076
Only people who live there.

01:07:31.109 --> 01:07:33.378
Or people who know people,
like my boyfriend does.

01:07:33.412 --> 01:07:35.180
You guys need to meet him.

01:07:35.214 --> 01:07:36.148
He'll be here in a minute.

01:07:36.181 --> 01:07:37.015
Mmm.

01:07:37.049 --> 01:07:38.383
You know what? I want
some more wine.

01:07:38.417 --> 01:07:39.786
In fact, I'll take
an I.V. of it.

01:07:39.819 --> 01:07:40.520
Noted.

01:07:40.553 --> 01:07:41.386
Two I.V.'s.

01:07:41.420 --> 01:07:43.690
Nessa, you've gotta slow
your roll, love.

01:07:43.723 --> 01:07:46.158
Um, why are you guys here,
again?

01:07:46.191 --> 01:07:48.327
Paul, he's doing
the panel thing.

01:07:48.360 --> 01:07:52.732
Yeah, because he has actual
things to say.

01:07:52.765 --> 01:07:54.333
Sorry.

01:07:54.366 --> 01:07:57.135
Um, there is a designer
on the panel

01:07:57.169 --> 01:08:00.072
and Paul wants
to ask her out.

01:08:00.105 --> 01:08:02.107
He makes us act like
we're interested in him

01:08:02.140 --> 01:08:04.409
so he can, like,
get girls.

01:08:04.444 --> 01:08:06.746
Yeah, it's legitimizing.

01:08:06.779 --> 01:08:09.047
Once I make partner I probably
won't need it.

01:08:09.081 --> 01:08:10.215
He's right.

01:08:10.249 --> 01:08:11.484
My boyfriend's a partner.

01:08:11.518 --> 01:08:12.485
It's attractive.

01:08:12.519 --> 01:08:14.787
I mean, my boyfriend's
already attractive.

01:08:14.821 --> 01:08:16.054
My boyfriend.

01:08:16.087 --> 01:08:17.154
My boyfriend.

01:08:17.189 --> 01:08:18.055
My boyfriend.

01:08:18.090 --> 01:08:18.825
My boyfriend.

01:08:18.858 --> 01:08:20.158
My boyfriend.

01:08:20.192 --> 01:08:21.326
My boyfriend.

01:08:21.359 --> 01:08:22.462
My boyfriend.

01:08:22.495 --> 01:08:23.630
My boyfriend.

01:08:23.662 --> 01:08:25.063
Maybe you should get
a shirt that says

01:08:25.096 --> 01:08:26.265
"I have a boyfriend"

01:08:26.298 --> 01:08:29.134
and then you wouldn't have
to tell us every five seconds.

01:08:29.167 --> 01:08:29.736
Ok, refill.

01:08:29.769 --> 01:08:31.203
Coming right up.

01:08:31.236 --> 01:08:32.604
I didn't mean to make
you jealous.

01:08:32.639 --> 01:08:33.404
Of what?

01:08:33.439 --> 01:08:34.406
You know what?

01:08:34.439 --> 01:08:35.475
This is a good time to go.

01:08:35.508 --> 01:08:36.274
I'm good.

01:08:36.308 --> 01:08:38.210
Oh, there he is.

01:08:46.618 --> 01:08:48.787
Ugh.

01:09:37.737 --> 01:09:39.671
I'm all out of sausage.

01:09:39.706 --> 01:09:43.108
I hope you brought your hot,
throbbing co-

01:09:45.745 --> 01:09:48.180
What am I doing?

01:10:49.241 --> 01:10:50.510
Thank you.

01:10:50.543 --> 01:10:52.244
We'll be in touch.

01:10:53.846 --> 01:10:55.380
It's that way.

01:11:02.955 --> 01:11:04.457
<i>Hey, Priscilla, it's me.</i>

01:11:04.490 --> 01:11:06.592
<i>So the audition went great.</i>

01:11:06.626 --> 01:11:07.794
<i>I did it!</i>

01:11:07.827 --> 01:11:10.328
<i>I finally crossed something
big off one of my lists.</i>

01:11:10.362 --> 01:11:12.498
<i>Ah, I feel amazing.</i>

01:11:27.547 --> 01:11:29.314
Jeff's getting married?

01:11:29.347 --> 01:11:31.551
And he's inviting you?

01:11:31.584 --> 01:11:33.820
And this is his idea of
a wedding invitation?

01:11:33.853 --> 01:11:35.621
Talk about no taste.

01:11:35.655 --> 01:11:36.789
It gets worse.

01:11:36.823 --> 01:11:37.924
Don't even.

01:11:37.957 --> 01:11:39.391
He wants you to play
at the wedding.

01:11:39.424 --> 01:11:40.392
Us.

01:11:40.426 --> 01:11:40.960
Yeah.

01:11:40.993 --> 01:11:41.894
He wants the quartet.

01:11:41.928 --> 01:11:43.261
Well, we're not doing that.

01:11:43.295 --> 01:11:44.362
And I don't even understand,

01:11:44.396 --> 01:11:45.898
why would he want you to be
there at the wedding?

01:11:45.932 --> 01:11:47.133
Maybe he feels guilty.

01:11:47.166 --> 01:11:50.268
I don't know, maybe he feels
like he's doing me a big favour.

01:11:50.302 --> 01:11:51.403
How is this a favour?

01:11:51.437 --> 01:11:52.739
The girl's family is loaded.

01:11:52.772 --> 01:11:55.742
Ok, so we're absolutely
doing it.

01:11:55.775 --> 01:11:57.643
But Jeff is a tool.

01:11:57.677 --> 01:11:59.512
And not a sharp one.

01:12:00.680 --> 01:12:01.948
Do you know, Luce, when uh,

01:12:01.981 --> 01:12:05.818
when Sharon left me
for Jennifer...

01:12:05.852 --> 01:12:08.488
it was more the rejection
that hurt.

01:12:08.521 --> 01:12:09.889
Not necessarily her leaving.

01:12:09.922 --> 01:12:12.725
Honestly, I don't really care
about Jeff leaving.

01:12:12.759 --> 01:12:13.993
And who wants to have
super lame sex

01:12:14.026 --> 01:12:15.762
the rest of their life, anyway?

01:12:15.795 --> 01:12:16.863
Uh, I do.

01:12:16.896 --> 01:12:21.033
Lame sex, virtual sex,
the faint possibility of sex,

01:12:21.067 --> 01:12:23.069
any of which would be more
than I'm currently getting.

01:12:23.102 --> 01:12:24.904
I can't even get my hand
to have sex with me anymore.

01:12:24.937 --> 01:12:27.372
Yeah, well, maybe if you dressed
up your hand like a redhead

01:12:27.405 --> 01:12:29.909
who cooks, loves musicals,
and has a PhD...

01:12:29.942 --> 01:12:31.978
I'm sad to report
that my standards

01:12:32.011 --> 01:12:34.013
have dropped somewhat
significantly.

01:12:34.046 --> 01:12:34.847
Oh yeah?

01:12:34.881 --> 01:12:36.381
Well, what is your type
these days?

01:12:36.414 --> 01:12:37.884
Willing.

01:12:39.018 --> 01:12:39.886
And I've got to go to Vegas
for a bachelor party.

01:12:39.919 --> 01:12:42.555
I swear, all those boobs
I can't touch

01:12:42.588 --> 01:12:44.023
might just be the end of me.

01:12:44.056 --> 01:12:45.992
Yeah, I'm pretty sure
no one over the age of two

01:12:46.025 --> 01:12:48.961
has ever died
from lack of boob.

01:12:48.995 --> 01:12:49.796
That's a valid point.

01:12:49.829 --> 01:12:52.064
Wait a second,
when are you leaving?

01:12:52.098 --> 01:12:52.965
For Vegas?

01:12:52.999 --> 01:12:53.966
Yeah.

01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:56.035
Tomorrow, why?

01:12:56.068 --> 01:12:57.670
Because I need to finish
my list

01:12:57.703 --> 01:12:59.005
and there's this Vegas thing
on there.

01:12:59.038 --> 01:13:00.973
No, no, no, you need
to finish it

01:13:01.007 --> 01:13:02.374
because Jeff's getting married.

01:13:02.407 --> 01:13:03.341
No, I-

01:13:03.375 --> 01:13:04.577
Besides, Grant's
gonna be there.

01:13:04.610 --> 01:13:05.978
I don't care if Grant's
gonna be there.

01:13:06.012 --> 01:13:08.481
I just need to finish my list,
alright?

01:13:08.514 --> 01:13:10.683
And you're gonna help me.

01:13:10.716 --> 01:13:11.717
So just embarrassing me

01:13:11.751 --> 01:13:13.853
at the strip club wasn't enough
for you, was it?

01:13:13.886 --> 01:13:15.054
This'll be so much better.

01:13:15.087 --> 01:13:15.888
Will it be, though?

01:13:15.922 --> 01:13:16.923
Yeah.

01:13:17.790 --> 01:13:19.625
Could I get more needles
in here, please?

01:13:19.659 --> 01:13:20.960
Tensing up!

01:13:57.063 --> 01:13:58.731
You need to have sex.

01:13:58.764 --> 01:14:00.566
And I have to finish
my list.

01:14:00.600 --> 01:14:02.034
So it's a win-win.

01:14:02.068 --> 01:14:03.202
Um, for losers.

01:14:03.236 --> 01:14:05.938
So I'm not sure we come out
on the right side of this.

01:14:05.972 --> 01:14:07.106
Ok.

01:14:07.139 --> 01:14:09.709
Here is who's working today.

01:14:11.777 --> 01:14:12.678
Nope.

01:14:12.712 --> 01:14:13.713
Can't do it.

01:14:13.746 --> 01:14:14.412
Do you know what?

01:14:14.447 --> 01:14:15.648
They're probably all diseased.

01:14:15.681 --> 01:14:17.717
No, you're more likely to catch
something in a sorority house.

01:14:17.750 --> 01:14:18.951
See?

01:14:18.985 --> 01:14:21.554
Here is a whole information
sheet about their weekly tests,

01:14:21.587 --> 01:14:23.522
how they check each customer
for symptoms,

01:14:23.556 --> 01:14:26.993
and clean everyone's genitals
with anti-bacterial-

01:14:27.026 --> 01:14:28.661
How about we don't use
the word "genitals"?

01:14:28.694 --> 01:14:30.196
Will you please just go
in there and do the deed

01:14:30.229 --> 01:14:31.430
so you can report back?

01:14:31.464 --> 01:14:33.466
Why don't you just go inside
and do the deed and report back?

01:14:33.499 --> 01:14:35.434
Because they don't service
lesbians or straight girls

01:14:35.468 --> 01:14:36.802
who like sex with women.

01:14:36.836 --> 01:14:39.005
How do you know they
don't service women?

01:14:39.038 --> 01:14:41.807
Oh my god, you called
and asked for yourself.

01:14:41.841 --> 01:14:44.443
Wow, you really have
turned over a new leaf.

01:14:44.477 --> 01:14:47.847
Look, you buy women
nice dinners all the time

01:14:47.880 --> 01:14:49.115
hoping to get sex out of it,
correct?

01:14:49.148 --> 01:14:50.883
What?

01:14:50.917 --> 01:14:51.984
Pfff.

01:14:53.986 --> 01:14:54.654
I- I do.

01:14:54.687 --> 01:14:55.855
Yeah.

01:14:55.888 --> 01:14:59.025
So that's just a more honest
side of the exact same coin,

01:14:59.058 --> 01:15:01.761
and it's perfectly natural.

01:15:02.762 --> 01:15:04.897
I'm not going in there alone.

01:15:04.931 --> 01:15:07.566
Well, great, let's get
in there.

01:15:07.600 --> 01:15:09.936
Wow. Called my bluff.

01:15:12.271 --> 01:15:14.206
Oh boy, this is happening.

01:15:16.642 --> 01:15:18.144
Hey, sweetheart.

01:15:18.177 --> 01:15:19.745
You worry too much.

01:15:19.779 --> 01:15:22.581
I told you there'd be other
normal people here.

01:15:22.615 --> 01:15:23.716
Howdy, fellas.

01:15:23.749 --> 01:15:25.484
How y'all doin' today?

01:15:25.518 --> 01:15:28.187
We're here to get her some,
if you know what I mean.

01:15:28.220 --> 01:15:30.690
Ain't that right,
honey bunch?

01:15:30.723 --> 01:15:33.092
It's a perfectly natural thing.

01:15:33.125 --> 01:15:35.494
What dialect is that?

01:15:35.528 --> 01:15:36.662
Is it not southern?

01:15:36.696 --> 01:15:38.030
Not at all.

01:15:38.064 --> 01:15:40.232
And just to be clear,
this is already not worth it.

01:15:40.266 --> 01:15:43.035
Just so we are clear, am I to
share your girl or get my own?

01:15:43.069 --> 01:15:45.972
I mean, we've not really worked
out any of the details here.

01:15:47.640 --> 01:15:48.741
Oh.

01:15:50.309 --> 01:15:51.677
Interesting.

01:15:52.244 --> 01:15:55.247
Ladies? Please say hello.

01:15:56.148 --> 01:15:59.018
Just like that, here they come,
down the staircase.

01:15:59.051 --> 01:16:01.120
Oh, that's a nice dress.

01:16:02.088 --> 01:16:03.489
Thank you.

01:16:03.956 --> 01:16:05.558
I need to go to the bathroom.

01:16:05.591 --> 01:16:08.761
Uh... I can't do this.

01:16:08.794 --> 01:16:09.929
I'm so, so sorry.

01:16:09.962 --> 01:16:10.963
May I squeeze through?

01:16:10.997 --> 01:16:13.032
Good luck.

01:16:13.733 --> 01:16:15.868
What happened to your boyfriend?

01:16:15.901 --> 01:16:18.070
Oh, no, he's not
my boyfriend.

01:16:18.104 --> 01:16:22.041
He's more of a colleague.

01:16:22.074 --> 01:16:23.976
Excuse me, doll?

01:16:24.010 --> 01:16:26.779
We don't service
single women here.

01:16:26.812 --> 01:16:30.883
Actually, I want to apply
for a job.

01:16:31.917 --> 01:16:33.085
As...?

01:16:33.119 --> 01:16:35.087
As a... you know,

01:16:35.121 --> 01:16:37.790
what they are-do.

01:16:37.823 --> 01:16:38.991
Hi.

01:16:39.025 --> 01:16:41.694
You want to be a working girl.

01:16:41.727 --> 01:16:43.095
Yeah.

01:16:49.869 --> 01:16:51.003
Wow.

01:16:51.037 --> 01:16:52.304
How'd it go?

01:16:52.338 --> 01:16:55.875
Well, I applied to be
one of the girls.

01:16:55.908 --> 01:16:57.043
I'm sorry, what?

01:16:57.076 --> 01:16:59.712
Well, I didn't get the job,
obviously.

01:16:59.745 --> 01:17:00.946
So quick question.

01:17:00.980 --> 01:17:02.281
When I tell the story later,

01:17:02.314 --> 01:17:03.849
which do you think is going
to be better?

01:17:03.883 --> 01:17:05.618
The fact that you applied
to be a prostitute

01:17:05.651 --> 01:17:06.986
or that you didn't get
the job?

01:17:07.019 --> 01:17:08.654
Anyway, I'm really sorry

01:17:08.687 --> 01:17:10.022
that you're late for
your bachelor party.

01:17:10.056 --> 01:17:10.790
No, that's alright.

01:17:10.823 --> 01:17:11.724
I'll just tell them
the truth,

01:17:11.757 --> 01:17:13.826
that you got hung up
at a job interview.

01:17:13.859 --> 01:17:15.127
I'm just teasing.

01:17:15.161 --> 01:17:16.962
They'd be lucky
to have you.

01:17:16.996 --> 01:17:18.130
Thank you.

01:17:33.712 --> 01:17:34.814
Here we are, huh?

01:17:34.847 --> 01:17:37.249
Well, I mean, are you sure you
don't wanna come along?

01:17:37.283 --> 01:17:39.118
You can always be the
entertainment package.

01:17:39.151 --> 01:17:41.720
No, I'm just gonna
wander around.

01:17:41.754 --> 01:17:42.556
Alright.

01:17:42.588 --> 01:17:44.090
All I want right now
is a quiet bar

01:17:44.123 --> 01:17:46.625
and an artfully
crafted cocktail.

01:17:46.659 --> 01:17:47.226
Fair enough.

01:17:47.259 --> 01:17:47.893
Have fun!

01:17:47.927 --> 01:17:49.228
Alright, have a good night!

01:17:51.097 --> 01:17:53.032
Woooo!

01:17:57.069 --> 01:17:58.237
Yes!

01:17:59.038 --> 01:18:00.239
Ooh, that's strong.

01:18:00.272 --> 01:18:01.874
Let's take a picture.

01:18:02.074 --> 01:18:03.375
My new friends.

01:18:03.409 --> 01:18:05.911
One, two, three.

01:18:08.080 --> 01:18:09.348
Alright, Vegas.

01:18:09.381 --> 01:18:12.218
Welcome to karaoke night
at the Blue Saloon.

01:18:12.251 --> 01:18:14.220
Up next we've got...

01:18:16.288 --> 01:18:17.990
Lucy Neal.

01:18:18.023 --> 01:18:18.991
Come on up.

01:18:19.024 --> 01:18:19.992
What?

01:18:20.025 --> 01:18:21.026
Oh, no.

01:18:21.060 --> 01:18:22.795
No, I didn't sign up.

01:18:22.828 --> 01:18:24.997
Well, someone put your name
in there.

01:18:26.031 --> 01:18:29.702
Well... actually,
I don't sing.

01:18:29.735 --> 01:18:30.970
What do you do, then?

01:18:31.003 --> 01:18:35.442
Um... I'm a violinist?

01:18:35.475 --> 01:18:37.042
Oh.

01:18:38.344 --> 01:18:39.712
Well then why don't
you come down

01:18:39.745 --> 01:18:40.679
and play some violin for us?

01:18:40.713 --> 01:18:41.113
Oh, no, no, no.

01:18:41.147 --> 01:18:41.780
No, I'm good.

01:18:41.814 --> 01:18:42.815
Thank you.

01:18:42.848 --> 01:18:44.016
Come on, there's only like
five people in here.

01:18:44.049 --> 01:18:45.351
What've you got to lose?

01:18:45.384 --> 01:18:46.952
Get up here, have some fun.

01:18:47.454 --> 01:18:48.821
Crap.

01:18:49.054 --> 01:18:50.289
Ok.

01:18:51.824 --> 01:18:53.859
Not cool, guys.

01:18:54.727 --> 01:18:55.961
Give it up for Lucy.

01:18:59.231 --> 01:19:01.367
I play classical mostly.

01:19:01.400 --> 01:19:02.234
Don't worry about it.

01:19:02.268 --> 01:19:03.736
Just play along.
We're in the key of G.

01:19:03.769 --> 01:19:04.270
It's an original.

01:19:04.303 --> 01:19:05.738
There's your bow.

01:19:07.907 --> 01:19:09.175

01:21:21.106 --> 01:21:22.841
Yeah.

01:21:22.875 --> 01:21:25.044
Well done.

01:21:25.077 --> 01:21:27.146
<i>Alright, let's see
who's up next.</i>

01:21:27.179 --> 01:21:29.848
<i>Anyone else have any
hidden talents out there?</i>

01:21:32.184 --> 01:21:33.486
What're you doing here?

01:21:33.520 --> 01:21:37.189
Shouldn't you be at the bachelor
party with Paul?

01:21:37.222 --> 01:21:39.992
Paul showed me the picture
you texted him

01:21:40.025 --> 01:21:43.262
of you and the posse
of Harvard boys.

01:21:43.295 --> 01:21:44.464
I recognized the bar so-

01:21:44.497 --> 01:21:45.197
What, so you-

01:21:45.230 --> 01:21:47.099
Thought I'd come looking
for you.

01:21:47.132 --> 01:21:49.602
Please tell me you've got
better than that.

01:21:53.372 --> 01:21:55.307
How about I tell you how sorry
I am that I fell off

01:21:55.341 --> 01:21:57.376
the face of the earth?

01:21:59.078 --> 01:22:00.346
I was an idiot.

01:22:00.379 --> 01:22:03.115
Why didn't you call?

01:22:03.148 --> 01:22:05.351
A bunch of reasons.

01:22:05.384 --> 01:22:07.152
None of them good.

01:22:08.987 --> 01:22:10.055
Ok, look.

01:22:10.089 --> 01:22:11.491
This has been fun and thank you
for whatever this is

01:22:11.524 --> 01:22:12.191
but I am not-

01:22:12.224 --> 01:22:13.258
But-but wait.

01:22:13.292 --> 01:22:16.128
Can I just have one second?

01:22:16.161 --> 01:22:20.366
Meeting you was
a big surprise.

01:22:20.399 --> 01:22:25.204
And then I realized how much
I really liked you.

01:22:25.237 --> 01:22:26.238
But then I-I just-

01:22:26.271 --> 01:22:29.074
Decided to show your
considerable appreciation

01:22:29.108 --> 01:22:33.045
by sleeping with me
and then running out?

01:22:33.078 --> 01:22:35.515
It's just-it's a scary
proposition.

01:22:35.548 --> 01:22:36.382
What's scary?

01:22:36.415 --> 01:22:36.949
I'm scary?

01:22:36.982 --> 01:22:39.952
What is scary about me?

01:22:43.222 --> 01:22:48.026
For starters, you're
obsessed with sex.

01:22:52.632 --> 01:22:58.337
Look, you came around
at a really weird time.

01:22:58.370 --> 01:23:00.406
And I know the list is bizarre

01:23:00.440 --> 01:23:04.076
but I've got something
important to prove.

01:23:04.109 --> 01:23:05.277
Prove what? To who?

01:23:05.310 --> 01:23:07.079
To myself.

01:23:09.749 --> 01:23:16.321
I guess... I need to prove
to myself that I'm enough.

01:23:25.197 --> 01:23:27.366
Leaving like that
was a mistake.

01:23:27.399 --> 01:23:30.703
Not calling you
was a mistake.

01:23:30.737 --> 01:23:33.673
Will you please forgive me?

01:23:51.290 --> 01:23:52.459
Sorry.

01:23:57.730 --> 01:23:58.197
Woah, woah, woah.

01:23:58.230 --> 01:23:59.198
Wait. Wait. Stop.

01:23:59.231 --> 01:23:59.933
Stop?

01:23:59.965 --> 01:24:02.201
I don't wanna hurt
the baby.

01:24:02.234 --> 01:24:03.770
What?

01:24:03.803 --> 01:24:08.073
Um... I'm not pregnant.

01:24:08.106 --> 01:24:09.374
I beg your pardon?

01:24:09.408 --> 01:24:10.108
Wait-

01:24:10.142 --> 01:24:11.210
You're not?

01:24:11.243 --> 01:24:13.746
I know-I know
I've been emotional

01:24:13.780 --> 01:24:16.516
and like I'm craving some weird
stuff, but oh my-oh my god,

01:24:16.549 --> 01:24:17.149
do I look pregnant?

01:24:17.182 --> 01:24:18.116
No, no, no.

01:24:18.150 --> 01:24:18.918
You're not emotional.

01:24:18.952 --> 01:24:20.185
You look stunning
and beautiful.

01:24:20.219 --> 01:24:26.225
It's uh, at your house you had
maternity pants on the chair.

01:24:26.258 --> 01:24:28.728
Honestly, I saw the pants
and I freaked out

01:24:28.761 --> 01:24:31.029
and that's why I left.

01:24:31.063 --> 01:24:33.198
Oh my god.

01:24:33.232 --> 01:24:35.200
What?

01:24:35.234 --> 01:24:36.168
Oh my god.

01:24:36.201 --> 01:24:39.706
You left because you thought
I was pregnant?

01:24:39.739 --> 01:24:41.206
It's a scary proposition.

01:24:46.278 --> 01:24:47.412
Wow.

01:24:50.583 --> 01:24:52.084
Wait.

01:24:53.185 --> 01:24:56.556
You thought that and you
still wanted to be with me.

01:25:06.466 --> 01:25:07.834
We like the same books.

01:25:07.867 --> 01:25:09.334
Mmm.

01:25:09.368 --> 01:25:11.136
Not in the same order.

01:25:11.169 --> 01:25:12.237
You're right.

01:25:12.271 --> 01:25:14.406
It's never gonna work.

01:25:41.133 --> 01:25:42.100
<i>Luce, it's Paul.</i>

01:25:42.134 --> 01:25:42.802
<i>You're never gonna believe this.</i>

01:25:42.835 --> 01:25:43.903
<i>I've met the girl of my dreams.</i>

01:25:43.937 --> 01:25:46.405
<i>Her name is Destiny and yes,
she is a stripper.</i>

01:25:46.439 --> 01:25:48.106
<i>Let me tell you...</i>

01:25:51.209 --> 01:25:52.879
<i>Hi Lucy, Howard Gregson.</i>

01:25:52.912 --> 01:25:56.114
<i>Our committee loved
your audition but ultimately</i>

01:25:56.148 --> 01:25:58.585
<i>decided your playing
is too expansive.</i>

01:25:58.618 --> 01:26:01.320
<i>A hair uninhibited
for our conductor.</i>

01:26:01.353 --> 01:26:04.156
<i>But I think your skills
are just a bit misplaced.</i>

01:26:04.189 --> 01:26:06.158
<i>To that end I have an
opportunity coming up</i>

01:26:06.191 --> 01:26:07.827
<i>in a couple of weeks.</i>

01:26:33.553 --> 01:26:34.854
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:26:34.887 --> 01:26:35.888
You all ready
for the wedding?

01:26:35.922 --> 01:26:39.224
Yes, but there's something
we need to do first.

01:26:46.466 --> 01:26:48.200
Wow.

01:26:48.233 --> 01:26:49.902
Well, you've still got one
more thing on your list.

01:26:49.936 --> 01:26:51.403
Oh.

01:26:51.437 --> 01:26:52.572
Yes, I do.

01:26:52.605 --> 01:26:54.172
Let's go.

01:27:01.447 --> 01:27:01.981
There you go.

01:27:02.015 --> 01:27:02.949
Thank you guys so much.

01:27:02.982 --> 01:27:04.517
Thank you.

01:27:04.550 --> 01:27:05.417
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:27:05.451 --> 01:27:06.318
Hey.

01:27:06.351 --> 01:27:07.386
Who can I make it out to?

01:27:07.419 --> 01:27:08.286
Uh, Lucy.

01:27:08.320 --> 01:27:10.222
Yeah, she's a big fan.

01:27:10.255 --> 01:27:12.257
Um, how do I spell that?

01:27:13.960 --> 01:27:16.863
Actually, there's a much
bigger fan

01:27:16.896 --> 01:27:19.632
that you should make this
out to.

01:27:21.968 --> 01:27:25.337
I mean, this is just so Jeff.

01:27:26.839 --> 01:27:27.940
Care to dance?

01:27:27.974 --> 01:27:30.175
Yes, I would love to.

01:27:49.529 --> 01:27:51.497
Ok, Stan.

01:27:51.531 --> 01:27:52.932
Woo!

01:27:52.965 --> 01:27:53.533
Hey, there she is.

01:27:53.566 --> 01:27:55.400
Here, come on.
Switch.

01:27:55.435 --> 01:27:56.602
Oh.

01:27:57.537 --> 01:27:58.771
Hey, congratulations.

01:27:58.805 --> 01:27:59.505
Oh, thanks.

01:27:59.539 --> 01:28:01.306
And thanks for playing
for us.

01:28:01.339 --> 01:28:03.509
The force is strong
with you.

01:28:07.146 --> 01:28:08.481
Mind if I...?

01:28:09.515 --> 01:28:10.883
That's cool.

01:28:12.585 --> 01:28:14.554
Thanks for doing this.

01:28:14.587 --> 01:28:16.288
The price was right.

01:28:16.321 --> 01:28:17.190
Is that the only reason?

01:28:17.222 --> 01:28:21.427
No. Well, maybe.
Ok, yes. It was. But...

01:28:21.461 --> 01:28:22.360
Ok.

01:28:22.394 --> 01:28:23.930
I'm glad I did.

01:28:23.963 --> 01:28:24.897
I'm glad we're good.

01:28:24.931 --> 01:28:26.532
Me too.

01:28:26.566 --> 01:28:27.533
Uh, I gotta ask you.

01:28:27.567 --> 01:28:31.971
Um, whatever happened
to that list you had?

01:28:32.004 --> 01:28:33.973
The interesting one?

01:28:34.006 --> 01:28:36.843
Wait until you see the wedding
gift I got for you.

01:28:53.626 --> 01:28:55.928
I can't find it.

01:28:55.962 --> 01:28:59.532
That's because
it's right here.

01:29:01.333 --> 01:29:04.537
And I can't wait to give it
to you.

01:29:13.813 --> 01:29:15.047
I'm... married.

01:29:15.081 --> 01:29:16.916
I'm-I got married.

01:29:16.949 --> 01:29:19.585
I'm married today.

01:29:22.088 --> 01:29:24.090
Thank you so much
for doing this.

01:29:24.123 --> 01:29:25.658
What can I say?

01:29:25.691 --> 01:29:26.926
I believe in love.

01:29:26.959 --> 01:29:29.061
Hey, Luce, all the bridesmaids
are twerking

01:29:29.095 --> 01:29:30.530
on the dance floor...

01:29:30.563 --> 01:29:32.598
Hi.

01:29:32.632 --> 01:29:33.499
I'm Paul.

01:29:33.533 --> 01:29:36.035
I'm Honey.

01:29:36.068 --> 01:29:38.971
Delighted.

01:29:39.005 --> 01:29:40.473
Are you gonna ask me
to dance?

01:29:40.506 --> 01:29:41.474
Yes, yes I am.

01:29:41.507 --> 01:29:43.042
Right this way, please.

01:29:52.417 --> 01:29:53.719
<i>Alright, ladies and gentlemen,</i>

01:29:53.753 --> 01:29:56.421
<i>there's only a few songs left
so get out on the dance floor.</i>

01:29:56.455 --> 01:29:59.391
<i>Let's celebrate
Jeff and Anne tonight.</i>

01:29:59.424 --> 01:30:01.027
<i>Let's send them off
with style.</i>

01:30:01.060 --> 01:30:04.730
<i>Don't forget to tip
your bartender.</i>

01:30:20.813 --> 01:30:21.547
What?
