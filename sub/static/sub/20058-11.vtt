WEBVTT

00:05.000 --> 00:07.500
[Spyro laughing] Yes!

00:15.500 --> 00:17.000
[Spyro] It'll be okay, Crash.

00:17.083 --> 00:20.083
If anybody can figure out
how to get you back home, it's Master Eon.

00:20.167 --> 00:23.042
And he's kind of a rock star when it comes
to the whole wizarding thing.

00:23.125 --> 00:24.583
No pressure, big guy.

00:24.667 --> 00:27.208
I'm just worried about my friends.

00:27.292 --> 00:29.792
Dr. Cortex was about to begin
his takeover of our world

00:29.875 --> 00:33.167
at the very moment I got sucked away here
into Skylands.

00:33.250 --> 00:35.208
Then time is of the essence, Crash.

00:35.292 --> 00:37.292
It will take every ounce of my powers

00:37.375 --> 00:40.542
to open an interdimensional rift
to send you home.

00:40.625 --> 00:43.042
But I shall do my utmost to make it so.

00:43.125 --> 00:44.125
Stand back.

00:44.792 --> 00:47.042
[breathes deeply]

00:48.583 --> 00:51.625
[straining] By my beard...

00:51.708 --> 00:53.083
[grunting]

00:53.167 --> 00:54.625
-[all gasping]
-[Crash] Whoa!

00:54.708 --> 00:58.333
Hurry, Crash. I don't know
how long I can keep this up!

00:58.417 --> 01:01.458
See ya, Skylanders.
Extreme exit!

01:03.750 --> 01:05.250
[grunts]

01:06.750 --> 01:09.000
That dude was so cool.

01:09.083 --> 01:11.125
I wish we could have gotten
to know him better.

01:11.208 --> 01:14.042
Yes, Eruptor, Crash was quite
the aspirational hero

01:14.125 --> 01:17.417
whose whacky adventures would make
for addictive weekly viewing.

01:17.500 --> 01:22.625
But alas, for us, he will
just have to be cool in our memories.

01:22.708 --> 01:24.042
-[Crash] Or right behind you.
-[Spyro gasps]

01:24.125 --> 01:25.625
-[all gasping]
-[Eon] What? Crash!

01:25.708 --> 01:27.208
Where did you come from?

01:27.292 --> 01:30.958
That rift was just a continuous loop
'cause it brought me right back here.

01:31.042 --> 01:32.417
Oh, my.

01:32.500 --> 01:35.667
This will be much tougher than I thought.

-I'm not sure.

02:10.208 --> 02:13.792
But since you were brought to our world
via a giant ball of evil,

02:13.875 --> 02:17.208
I believe that dark magic is needed to
conjure the rift necessary

02:17.292 --> 02:18.292
to send you home.

02:18.375 --> 02:19.625
Oh, man.

02:19.708 --> 02:21.750
Does this mean we need to use
the evil-scope again?

02:21.833 --> 02:24.375
No, Spyro.
But I do need you all

02:24.458 --> 02:26.875
to find a dark relic with which
I can combine light

02:26.958 --> 02:29.958
and dark to create the pathway
to Crash's world.

02:30.042 --> 02:32.417
What qualifies as a dark relic?

02:32.500 --> 02:34.958
They come in many shapes and sizes.

02:35.042 --> 02:36.292
Sometimes it can be a sword.

02:36.375 --> 02:37.750
Sometimes a skull.

02:37.833 --> 02:40.208
Sometimes even a puppy.

02:40.292 --> 02:44.458
-No one likes an evil puppy.
-No, they do not, Eruptor.

02:44.542 --> 02:46.500
So, where do we find
one of these dark relic thingies?

02:46.583 --> 02:48.791
They can be found throughout our realm,

02:48.875 --> 02:52.750
but in the interest of time,
begin your search in the Falling Forest,

02:52.833 --> 02:55.291
in its deepest, darkest parts.

02:55.375 --> 02:58.250
The part where stuff
actually starts falling.

02:58.750 --> 02:59.750
That doesn't sound too tough.

02:59.833 --> 03:01.958
Oh, but it can be, Spyro.

03:02.042 --> 03:05.750
Not only does evil lurk
in the forest's deepest reaches,

03:05.833 --> 03:09.667
but odd occurrences have been known
to happen there, too.

03:09.750 --> 03:14.333
Many a Skylander have returned reporting
strange things that happened to them.

03:14.417 --> 03:19.042
You all must be more vigilant than ever,
and be ready for anything.

03:19.125 --> 03:21.750
What are we waiting for?
Let's do this, Skylanders.

03:21.833 --> 03:24.625
Crash, I'm not sure that's a good idea--

03:24.708 --> 03:27.542
Master Eon, if your team
is going to face danger

03:27.625 --> 03:30.750
in order to help me,
I'm not letting them do it alone.

03:30.833 --> 03:33.750
Besides,
I'll be way more useful by their side

03:33.833 --> 03:36.667
than staying here
and worrying the whole time.

03:36.750 --> 03:37.958
Very well, Crash.

03:38.042 --> 03:40.500
Skylanders, keep him safe.

03:40.583 --> 03:43.042
He's unfamiliar with the dangers
we face here in Skylands.

03:43.125 --> 03:46.375
[chuckles] I've seen plenty of danger
back in my world, too.

03:46.458 --> 03:49.917
If push comes to shove, I'll be able to
handle myself right proper.

03:50.750 --> 03:52.292
All righty then, shall we?

03:53.292 --> 03:54.708
[grunting]

03:57.000 --> 03:59.583
That guy really knows how to make an exit.

04:04.292 --> 04:08.583
So, that spring-action stuff you did
back in the library was pretty sweet.

04:08.667 --> 04:10.583
Uh, what other cool stuff
can you do, Crash?

04:10.667 --> 04:13.000
Well, since Dr. Cortex mutated me,

04:13.083 --> 04:15.958
pretty much all of my abilities
and senses are enhanced.

04:16.041 --> 04:19.208
-Enhanced strength, enhanced stamina--
-Enhanced taco consumption?

04:19.291 --> 04:21.291
Uh, how is that a superpower, mate?

04:21.375 --> 04:23.417
Uh, how is it not?

04:24.833 --> 04:26.167
What is it, Crash?

04:26.250 --> 04:28.167
There's someone just ahead
through the brush.

04:28.250 --> 04:30.083
[whispers] Everyone, behind the rock.

04:33.875 --> 04:37.250
Claire, I have an itch on my back.
Do you think you can get it?

04:37.333 --> 04:38.667
I don't know, Gary.

04:38.750 --> 04:41.458
[yelling] Do you think you can
go back in time and ask for directions?

04:42.708 --> 04:45.667
Hurry up!
I'm getting hangry.

04:45.750 --> 04:47.250
I know we're looking for a dark relic,

04:47.333 --> 04:49.625
but we can't let those Greebles
eat that Mabu couple.

04:49.708 --> 04:51.458
Even if they have
obvious marital dysfunction.

04:51.542 --> 04:53.625
You're right, Elf.
Should be a snap.

04:53.708 --> 04:56.333
I'll just set my vac-gun
to TNT disable and...

04:56.417 --> 04:58.958
What? My vac-gun.
It isn't working.

04:59.042 --> 05:00.958
I can throw a freezing potion on them.

05:01.875 --> 05:04.542
Hmm, I could've sworn
that's where I kept my potions.

05:04.625 --> 05:06.250
[wheezes]

05:06.333 --> 05:08.792
[gasps] My fire is gone, too.

05:08.875 --> 05:10.167
I got nothing.

05:11.917 --> 05:14.583
Oh, no.
All of our powers have been diminished.

05:14.667 --> 05:18.167
This must be what Eon meant by all that
"strange occurrences" business.

05:18.250 --> 05:20.167
Okay, this isn't usually my style,

05:20.250 --> 05:22.750
but we're gonna need a plan
to save the Mabu from those Greebles.

05:22.833 --> 05:23.958
Yes!

05:24.042 --> 05:25.500
Just thinking out loud here,

05:25.583 --> 05:28.875
but seeing as how
these Greebles are obviously evil,

05:28.958 --> 05:31.708
maybe they have one of those dark relics
we're looking for.

05:31.792 --> 05:34.375
So, this could be
one of those two-for-one dealies.

05:34.458 --> 05:38.083
Could be. But will we even recognize
a dark relic when we see it?

05:39.708 --> 05:42.875
All right, dummies,
it's time for my daily me-ditation.

05:42.958 --> 05:46.875
No one bother me for the next hour,
or I swear sheep's gonna get real.

05:46.958 --> 05:48.625
Do not test me!

05:53.167 --> 05:54.167
Hmm.

05:56.792 --> 05:57.792
[sighs]

06:00.625 --> 06:04.292
[chanting]

06:06.542 --> 06:09.917
[whispering] Mother's all-powerful book
of dark magic spells.

06:10.000 --> 06:13.667
If I can get my hands on that bad boy
and harness the power within,

06:13.750 --> 06:17.042
I'll be the most powerful villain
in the Skylands.

06:17.125 --> 06:18.958
A very big "if," for sure.

06:19.042 --> 06:21.125
I should probably stop
whispering to myself now,

06:21.208 --> 06:23.083
in a chamber with this much echo.

06:23.167 --> 06:25.625
[Jet-Vac] Okay,
this rock here, that's Eruptor.

06:25.708 --> 06:27.750
The anthill, that's Spyro and Pop.

06:27.833 --> 06:30.750
Now, I'm the acorn and Elf is that X.
Everyone follow?

06:30.833 --> 06:32.958
-Who's the stick?
-The...

06:33.042 --> 06:35.458
[sighs] No one is the stick, Eruptor.

06:35.542 --> 06:38.583
I'm making the plan with the stick.

06:38.667 --> 06:42.417
[sighs] Good grief.
Now, Crash, you see this ladybug here?

06:42.500 --> 06:45.333
-Crash? Crash? Where did he go?
-[all gasp]

06:46.542 --> 06:48.292
[grunting] Yah!

06:50.500 --> 06:53.333
[chuckles] Extreme rescue mission!

06:53.417 --> 06:54.500
-[grunts]
-[Crash] Ha-yah.

06:54.583 --> 06:56.875
Where's that theme song coming from?

06:56.958 --> 06:59.833
I mean, I'm not complaining.
It's super catchy.

06:59.917 --> 07:02.500
You set off our TNT.
Are you crazy?

07:02.583 --> 07:05.917
[chuckles] You could make a strong
argument in favor of that, sure. Ha-yah!

07:06.000 --> 07:07.750
[grunting]

07:10.583 --> 07:11.583
Gotcha!

07:13.958 --> 07:17.542
[both yelling] This is your fault!

07:17.625 --> 07:20.667
Mabu saved.
Oh, and we should all duck.

07:20.750 --> 07:21.750
[rapid beeping]

07:23.167 --> 07:25.417
[groans] Owie.

07:25.500 --> 07:27.417
[Eruptor] Holy wow!
[Stealth Elf] Amazing!

07:27.500 --> 07:29.458
That... was...

07:29.542 --> 07:33.333
the coolest thing I have ever seen!

07:33.417 --> 07:35.917
Teach me your ways, Crash Bandicoot.

07:36.000 --> 07:39.500
Way to man up, Gary.
Saved by a bandicoot.

07:39.583 --> 07:42.333
I don't even know
what a bandicoot is, Claire.

07:42.417 --> 07:43.708
But since you do...

07:43.792 --> 07:45.708
[yelling] why don't you marry it?

07:45.792 --> 07:49.667
Oh! That's your answer
for everything, isn't it, Gary?

07:51.208 --> 07:54.458
And did you see the way that
Crash sproinged off that tree?

07:54.542 --> 07:55.583
Uh, Spyro?

07:56.125 --> 07:57.792
[grunts]

07:57.875 --> 08:00.417
And then the way he splanged off
that Greeble's face?

08:00.500 --> 08:02.875
[grunts] Dude, I know, I was there, too.

08:03.875 --> 08:05.458
[grunts and groans]

08:05.542 --> 08:07.417
Might wanna watch your step
around here, Elf.

08:07.500 --> 08:08.667
Fallen trees and all.

08:08.750 --> 08:10.625
Look, Spyro,
it's cool how much you admire Crash,

08:10.708 --> 08:13.833
but I'm a little worried that
you're losing sight of our mission.

08:13.917 --> 08:16.875
Oh, no, no, no, no.
I'm good. I'm focused, I swear.

08:16.958 --> 08:19.583
I'm just, like, so inspired by that guy.

08:19.667 --> 08:23.792
I mean, why just be a hero when you
can be a cool hero, am I right?

08:23.875 --> 08:24.958
-I honestly don't think so.
-[gasps]

08:25.042 --> 08:27.792
Oh, Elf!
Look at the way Crash is tying his shoes.

08:27.875 --> 08:30.042
Come on,
let's catch up and get a better look.

08:32.000 --> 08:38.073
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

08:55.208 --> 08:56.208
[thudding]

09:05.208 --> 09:07.042
Let's go and get that dark relic.

09:08.292 --> 09:10.083
Yes, of course I'm gonna see the reboot.

09:10.167 --> 09:12.208
You know I'm already
"shut up and take my money"

09:12.292 --> 09:13.750
when it comes to that franchise.

09:13.833 --> 09:16.750
But how many times do we
have to see his parents die?

09:16.833 --> 09:19.625
And does the new costume
really need a double chin?

09:19.708 --> 09:21.333
[scatting and humming]

09:21.417 --> 09:22.458
[grunts]

09:22.542 --> 09:25.042
Gotta run, Lori.
Ah, somebody's in a good mood.

09:25.125 --> 09:26.958
Indeed I am, Glumshanks,

09:27.042 --> 09:31.583
for I have decided that it is time
to borrow Mother's all-powerful spell book

09:31.667 --> 09:33.708
from her me-ditation chamber.

09:33.792 --> 09:35.583
And so, that's what I did.

09:35.667 --> 09:37.625
Does she know about said borrowing, sir?

09:37.708 --> 09:39.833
Eh, not in technical terms, no.

09:39.917 --> 09:43.250
By the time she returns
to her me-ditation chamber,

09:43.333 --> 09:46.458
I'll be done with the book and it will be
right back where she left it.

09:46.542 --> 09:49.208
Next question that will surely have
an ill-conceived answer,

09:49.292 --> 09:50.958
what are you going to do with it?

09:51.042 --> 09:53.583
Hmm, hadn't thought that far ahead.

09:53.667 --> 09:56.083
-[sighs] Par for the course.
-I know.

09:56.167 --> 09:58.042
I'll open it.

09:58.125 --> 10:01.667
Finally. I'll have access
to all the glorious dark magic

10:01.750 --> 10:04.042
Mother has kept from me my whole life.

10:05.042 --> 10:07.500
[mumbling and straining]

10:07.583 --> 10:10.375
What? Open up! [grunting]

10:11.458 --> 10:14.250
Looks like your mother has put
a pretty powerful spell on that book

10:14.333 --> 10:16.042
to keep looky-loos from opening it.

10:16.125 --> 10:18.250
Or you.
Probably just you.

10:18.333 --> 10:20.292
[whining] No! This isn't fair!

10:20.375 --> 10:21.958
It's not fair!

10:22.042 --> 10:24.167
I don't wanna interrupt
a good petulant fit, sir,

10:24.250 --> 10:26.583
but we should probably get the book
back to the castle,

10:26.667 --> 10:28.250
before Kaossandra sees it's missing.

10:28.333 --> 10:29.417
[Kaos] No way!

10:29.500 --> 10:32.208
If Mother has used her magic
to keep me out of this book,

10:32.292 --> 10:35.583
that means it's probably
way more powerful than I thought.

10:35.667 --> 10:39.167
So, I just need to find someone else
who can undo her spell.

10:39.250 --> 10:43.333
Someone with powerful darkness
at their disposal.

10:44.875 --> 10:47.708
Something's different about you.

10:47.792 --> 10:49.958
-Were you always purple?
-[Jet-Vac] Everyone, look!

10:52.250 --> 10:55.792
Ew, this campsite is creepy.

10:55.875 --> 10:59.667
Creepy enough to be the kind of place
where one might find a dark relic.

10:59.750 --> 11:02.917
Top-shelf thinking, Eruptor.
Team, ransack.

11:05.625 --> 11:08.292
Crash, Crash. Crash, check it.
What do you think this is?

11:08.375 --> 11:11.625
Uh... [stammers] an evil cast-iron
face-smasher with a handle?

11:11.708 --> 11:13.917
Creative guess, but I'm gonna go with...

11:14.000 --> 11:15.667
frying pan?

11:15.750 --> 11:18.708
[chuckles] Oh, wow.
You kept it simple, and boom!

11:18.792 --> 11:20.583
Problem solved.

11:20.667 --> 11:21.833
Quick. Everyone, hide!

11:21.917 --> 11:23.083
[Skylanders gasp]

11:23.167 --> 11:25.375
Is Chompy Puppet ready
for some Chompy time?

11:25.458 --> 11:26.875
[laughs] Chomp-tastic!

11:26.958 --> 11:29.542
So this one's a little off, eh?

11:29.625 --> 11:31.333
What's his deal, Spyro?

11:31.417 --> 11:33.917
-Spyro?
-Oh, no.

11:34.000 --> 11:35.792
[grunting]

11:35.875 --> 11:38.292
Now how did Crash do the thing where he...
Uh-oh!

11:38.375 --> 11:39.667
[yells and grunts]

11:40.333 --> 11:43.250
[groans] Extreme accidental fall.

11:43.333 --> 11:46.167
Spyro?
What are you doing at my campsite?

11:46.250 --> 11:49.667
Taking you down in a super cool way.
Crash, watch this.

11:50.875 --> 11:52.250
[grunts]

11:54.625 --> 11:56.125
[straining]

11:58.083 --> 12:00.333
-[gasps]
-More Skylanders?

12:00.417 --> 12:03.125
And a fox wearing blue jeans?
Why... why is that?

12:03.208 --> 12:05.292
-I'm a bandicoot.
-A band of what?

12:05.375 --> 12:06.667
Just give Spyro back.

12:06.750 --> 12:09.833
Nah.
Gonna do the opposite of that!

12:09.917 --> 12:10.917
[grunts]

12:11.000 --> 12:12.500
-[all coughing]
-Stink!

12:13.500 --> 12:15.250
Chompy got away.

12:15.333 --> 12:17.750
Extreme shocked reaction.

12:17.833 --> 12:20.625
[coughing] I told Spyro
not to fanboy over you.

12:20.708 --> 12:22.750
But he wants to be like you so much,

12:22.833 --> 12:24.708
that he forgot
why we're in the Falling Forest...

12:24.792 --> 12:28.750
To find a way to send you home,
not screw up so you're stuck here forever.

12:28.833 --> 12:30.625
I mean, unless you want that.

12:30.708 --> 12:32.375
You seem like a pretty heroic dude.

12:32.458 --> 12:34.708
We can always use
more of those in Skylands.

12:34.792 --> 12:36.333
Well, as flattered as I am,

12:36.417 --> 12:39.583
I really do need to get home
and save my own world from evil.

12:39.667 --> 12:42.125
Seems like you lot got this place
under control.

12:42.208 --> 12:43.917
Eh, we do okay.

12:44.000 --> 12:47.042
Well, when we're not getting kidnapped
by the bad guys, that is.

12:47.125 --> 12:49.792
On that note, back to the task at hand.

12:49.875 --> 12:52.417
Finding creepy puppet man and Spyro.

12:55.083 --> 12:56.667
This way, Skylanders.

12:57.458 --> 12:59.917
[Spyro grunting]

13:01.375 --> 13:03.708
Let me go, Chompy!

13:03.792 --> 13:05.333
'Fraid not, dragon boy.

13:05.417 --> 13:08.458
You see, we're gonna use you
for our Chompy summoning spell.

13:08.542 --> 13:11.500
Ha!
We totally needed a dragon to sacrifice,

13:11.583 --> 13:13.917
and you fell right into our laps.

13:14.000 --> 13:17.083
[both laughing maniacally]

13:17.167 --> 13:18.708
-Quiet!
-Quiet. Okay.

13:18.792 --> 13:20.250
Sacrifice?

13:20.333 --> 13:23.250
Oh, man, I really screwed up this time.

13:24.167 --> 13:27.125
You know who wouldn't have been captured
by a guy who talks to a puppet?

13:27.208 --> 13:28.917
-Crash.
-[Chompy Mage] You know,

13:29.000 --> 13:30.458
as much as I'd love to hear
more about this fella

13:30.542 --> 13:32.167
you obviously have a man-crush on,

13:32.250 --> 13:33.833
spells don't cast themselves.

13:33.917 --> 13:36.875
So, first things first,
can't have you making a ruckus

13:36.958 --> 13:39.500
for your pals to find us, so...

13:39.583 --> 13:41.375
Chompy Puppet time!

13:41.458 --> 13:44.750
[laughing maniacally]
Chomp-solutely! Open wide!

13:44.833 --> 13:45.833
[blubbers]

13:45.917 --> 13:48.833
-[gags and coughs]
-Oh, Chompy Mage?

13:48.917 --> 13:51.125
Kaos! What are you doing here?

13:51.208 --> 13:53.667
Hello, old friend. How are you?
Me, I'm great.

13:53.750 --> 13:55.083
Now that we've got the niceties
out of the way,

13:55.167 --> 13:57.042
let's get to brass tacks, shall we?

13:57.125 --> 13:59.667
I need help opening my mother's book
of dark magic spells

13:59.750 --> 14:02.125
and I thought you would be
just the man for the... [gasps]

14:02.208 --> 14:03.458
Spyro?

14:03.542 --> 14:05.333
What's he doing here?

14:05.417 --> 14:08.458
Oh, sacrifice, Chompy summoning spell,
blah, blah, bliggity blah.

14:08.542 --> 14:10.167
Now back to the book.

14:10.250 --> 14:12.792
That's one powerful piece of prose
you got there.

14:12.875 --> 14:14.333
What do you want for it?

14:14.417 --> 14:15.792
[cackles]

14:15.875 --> 14:16.875
I would never...

14:16.958 --> 14:18.500
[gasps] Hold that thought, please.

14:18.583 --> 14:22.042
Glummy. I was just struck
by another ingenious idea.

14:22.125 --> 14:24.917
What if I bring home a Skylander
to impress Mother?

14:25.000 --> 14:28.292
Surely then she'll finally teach me
all the spells in this book.

14:28.375 --> 14:31.625
Right, I'm sure she'll just turn a blind
eye to your theft and disobedience.

14:31.708 --> 14:33.833
You know her so well, sir.

14:33.917 --> 14:35.625
Okay, Chompers, chew on this.

14:35.708 --> 14:38.375
You use one of your spells
to open this book for me,

14:38.458 --> 14:39.833
I'll give you a spell from within,

14:39.917 --> 14:42.958
and in exchange,
you give me the Skylander.

14:43.042 --> 14:44.167
Hmm.

14:44.250 --> 14:47.583
How about the whole book
for the whole dragon?

14:47.667 --> 14:49.792
-No way! Four spells!
-Eight!

14:49.875 --> 14:51.083
-Two!
-Twelve!

14:51.167 --> 14:54.542
[grunts] Look,
you need a Chompy summoning spell,

14:54.625 --> 14:56.833
and I know there's one in there.

14:56.917 --> 14:58.458
So are we gonna do this thing or not?

15:02.292 --> 15:03.500
Deal!

15:03.583 --> 15:06.083
But first I need my Chompy puppet,
then we'll get on with it.

15:06.167 --> 15:07.917
[spits and coughs]

15:08.000 --> 15:10.958
Dude, do you ever wash your puppet?
Or your hand?

15:11.042 --> 15:14.792
Now then, Glumshanks will hold the book
as you conjure it open. Ready?

15:14.875 --> 15:17.042
[chanting]

15:20.250 --> 15:21.750
[continues chanting]

15:22.958 --> 15:23.917
[grunting]

15:27.000 --> 15:28.208
Hmm. Okay. And?

15:28.292 --> 15:29.958
That's one serious curse

15:30.042 --> 15:32.208
your mum put on that book
to keep people out.

15:32.292 --> 15:38.042
Which means...
there must be serious evil inside.

15:38.125 --> 15:39.250
[Kaos] So what are you saying?

15:39.333 --> 15:41.000
Can you open it or not?

15:41.083 --> 15:42.792
I'm saying... gimme!

15:44.500 --> 15:45.750
[grunts]

15:45.833 --> 15:48.333
No one steals Mother's book but me.

15:48.417 --> 15:52.000
[groans] When did your magic get stronger?

15:52.917 --> 15:56.083
Yeah.
That hurt Chompy Mage bad.

15:56.167 --> 15:59.417
You and the Doom Raiders think
I'm not a force to be reckoned with,

15:59.500 --> 16:02.958
but maybe it's high time
I take one of you out...

16:03.042 --> 16:05.792
so no one makes that mistake ever again.

16:05.875 --> 16:07.958
Say good night, Chompies.

16:08.042 --> 16:09.583
[Crash grunting]

16:09.667 --> 16:11.417
Extreme takedown.

16:11.500 --> 16:12.708
Who are you?

16:12.792 --> 16:15.625
Crash Bandicoot.
And I brought some good mates with me.

16:15.708 --> 16:17.167
Guys! Help!

16:19.875 --> 16:22.208
Oh no, you don't.
Spyro's coming with me.

16:22.292 --> 16:24.042
[all grunting]

16:29.750 --> 16:31.833
[Kaos] Aw, what's the matter, Skydummies?

16:31.917 --> 16:33.333
Lose your powers?

16:33.417 --> 16:37.000
Works for me. I'll just take all five
of you back home to Mother then.

16:37.083 --> 16:38.250
Again with this?

16:38.333 --> 16:41.208
I can't cast dark magic
in two places at once.

16:41.292 --> 16:42.458
[grunts]

16:42.542 --> 16:43.792
Glummy! The book!

16:43.875 --> 16:46.833
You get Spyro, I'll handle baldy.
Crash dash!

16:48.250 --> 16:51.125
Give me that book
before I put a hurt on you, too.

16:51.208 --> 16:53.667
Sorry, mate, but I'm not from this world,

16:53.750 --> 16:56.125
which means my powers here are A-okay.

16:56.208 --> 16:57.792
[grunting]

16:57.875 --> 16:59.333
[Kaos grunts]

17:00.083 --> 17:01.417
[Eruptor] You okay, buddy?

17:01.500 --> 17:04.250
I am now that you guys are here.
How'd you find us?

17:04.333 --> 17:07.041
Chompy Mage left a trail of tent
through the forest.

17:07.125 --> 17:09.041
Plus,
Kaos was none-too-subtle with all his

17:09.125 --> 17:12.958
"Oh, I'm so powerful, I'm going to do
something stupid and evil now" nonsense.

17:13.041 --> 17:15.083
-[Stealth Elf] Chompy Mage's work?
-Yep.

17:15.166 --> 17:16.875
Don't worry,
we'll make him reverse the spell

17:16.958 --> 17:18.375
and you'll be out of there in no time.

17:18.458 --> 17:21.541
But until then, will you please
listen to me next time I tell you

17:21.625 --> 17:22.833
to stay focused on the mission?

17:22.916 --> 17:24.416
I know, I know.

17:24.500 --> 17:27.125
I just got so excited
by the way Crash does his thing

17:27.208 --> 17:29.208
that I wanted to be just like him.

17:29.292 --> 17:31.500
I'm sorry that I messed up, guys.

17:31.583 --> 17:34.250
Well, remember that
for the next time, pal.

17:34.333 --> 17:38.042
Crash ain't always gonna be here
to save our butts if we lose our powers.

17:38.125 --> 17:40.458
That's right.
We need to stick together.

17:40.542 --> 17:42.417
[Stealth Elf] And stick to the mission.

17:42.500 --> 17:43.875
Well, I'm still here, mate.

17:43.958 --> 17:47.458
So, how 'bout we make the "puppet man"
remove those chains already?

17:47.542 --> 17:48.750
Are you okay, sir?

17:48.833 --> 17:52.833
Anybody get the number of the jackhammer
that ran over my face?

17:52.917 --> 17:54.958
He's just over there, sir,
with the Skylanders.

17:55.042 --> 17:56.917
All right, Chompy Mage.

17:57.000 --> 18:00.417
Remove Spyro's chains
or I'll cyclone your teeth into next week.

18:00.500 --> 18:04.750
Uh, well, I totally got this thing
I need to be at, so I'll be, uh--

18:04.833 --> 18:07.000
Toodles! Ha!

18:10.333 --> 18:11.417
No sweat, Spyro.

18:11.500 --> 18:14.042
I'm sure Eon can make
those chains go poof.

18:15.083 --> 18:18.042
Guys, I just realized
we still need a dark relic.

18:18.125 --> 18:20.000
Without that,
we can't send Crash back home.

18:20.083 --> 18:21.583
What are we gonna do?

18:21.667 --> 18:24.167
Would this qualify as a dark relic?

18:25.375 --> 18:26.625
Oh, my.

18:26.708 --> 18:29.792
I haven't seen this in a very long time.

18:29.875 --> 18:32.625
I thought it had been destroyed
during the Great War.

18:33.792 --> 18:36.458
The fact that I'm holding it in my hands
at this very moment--

18:36.542 --> 18:39.667
But it's definitely a dark relic, right?

18:39.750 --> 18:41.958
Indeed.
One of the darkest.

18:42.833 --> 18:47.333
And just what I need to open the rift
to send Crash back home.

18:47.417 --> 18:51.417
I will now chant a spell that will combine
light and dark in this room,

18:51.500 --> 18:55.792
splitting a seam in reality long enough
for Crash to jump through...

18:55.875 --> 18:58.125
and finally return home.

18:58.208 --> 18:59.708
[inhales deeply]

18:59.792 --> 19:02.917
[chanting]

19:20.292 --> 19:22.208
Crash! It is time!

19:22.292 --> 19:25.083
I can't thank you enough
for all you've done to help me, guys.

19:25.167 --> 19:27.250
We'll meet again soon, buddy.

19:27.333 --> 19:29.083
And good luck defeating Dr. Cortex.

19:30.125 --> 19:32.292
Hey, thanks for saving my tail today.

19:32.375 --> 19:34.583
I can honestly say
I'll never forget you, man.

19:34.667 --> 19:36.708
I'm not sure if it was obvious,
but you are definitely

19:36.792 --> 19:38.083
the coolest dude I've ever met. [chuckles]

19:38.167 --> 19:40.583
Well, you are one cool dude yourself,
mate.

19:40.667 --> 19:42.375
-All of you are.
-Knew it.

19:42.458 --> 19:47.042
Just be yourselves. Me? I'm a lone wolf.
That's my thing.

19:47.125 --> 19:49.542
But the five of you together,
making up this amazing unit,

19:49.625 --> 19:51.417
is definitely your thing.

19:51.500 --> 19:53.875
Always remember that,
and you'll always win.

19:55.042 --> 19:56.625
[straining] Any time now, Crash!

19:56.708 --> 19:59.667
You rule, Skylanders.
See you on the flip side.

19:59.750 --> 20:01.833
Extreme goodbye!

20:03.500 --> 20:07.000
He... he... he called me cool.

20:07.083 --> 20:08.458
[grunts]

20:08.542 --> 20:09.875
[Pop Fizz] Are you okay?
[Spyro] Eon!

20:09.958 --> 20:12.000
[Jet-Vac] Get him some water!
[Eruptor] Ooh, what's happening?

20:12.083 --> 20:13.375
[Stealth Elf] Give his beard
some room to breathe.

20:13.458 --> 20:15.292
-[Eon moans]
-[gasps]

20:15.375 --> 20:18.167
That was most taxing, Skylanders.

20:19.167 --> 20:23.208
Combining my light magic
with the forces of darkness...

20:23.292 --> 20:26.583
was a bit more than... than I expected.

20:26.667 --> 20:30.083
-Are you okay?
-I... I shall be fine.

20:30.167 --> 20:32.333
I just need to rest, is all.

20:32.417 --> 20:34.667
And to study that spell book.

20:34.750 --> 20:38.792
It holds a power...
even I do not fully understand.

20:39.708 --> 20:42.125
[Kaossandra shouting]
You did what?

20:42.208 --> 20:44.875
Do you have any idea

20:44.958 --> 20:48.208
how much trouble losing that book
is going to cause?

20:48.292 --> 20:50.375
I know it's not the most ideal situation,

20:50.458 --> 20:54.000
having your powerful book be
in the possession of the Skylanders, but--

20:54.083 --> 20:56.542
I'm not worried
about the Skylanders, idiot!

20:56.625 --> 20:58.500
I'm worried about
all the other evil lunatics

20:58.583 --> 21:01.667
who want to get their hands on
such an all-powerful relic!

21:01.750 --> 21:03.917
And now I'm gonna have to go
to that stupid academy,

21:04.000 --> 21:08.000
sneak in, and get my book back
before the sheep really hits the fan.

21:08.083 --> 21:10.500
[stuttering] You didn't tell anyone else
about the book, did you?

21:10.583 --> 21:13.583
[stuttering] No!
I didn't tell a single soul!

21:25.500 --> 21:27.417
The Skylanders!

21:30.708 --> 21:32.542
