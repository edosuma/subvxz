00:01.035 --> 00:02.436
ADULT ADAM:
Ah, the school prank.

00:02.503 --> 00:05.239
Back in the day, it was a pure
and simple art form.

00:05.306 --> 00:07.308
You didn't care about posting
some video to go viral.

00:07.375 --> 00:09.910
No. You'd pull a prank
to become legend.

00:09.977 --> 00:11.912
Yes!
Seniors rule!

00:11.979 --> 00:14.915
In my school, the '80s was the
pinnacle of the pranking era,

00:14.982 --> 00:17.751
and our success was measured
by one thing,

00:17.818 --> 00:19.753
how much it pissed off
our principal.

00:19.820 --> 00:21.722
Oh, no.

00:21.789 --> 00:23.324
Darn seniors!

00:23.391 --> 00:25.226
I'm going down.

00:25.293 --> 00:28.129
Naturally, no one loved
a good prank more than
my brother, Barry.

00:28.196 --> 00:29.763
Good fountain.

00:29.830 --> 00:31.532
Trusted posse
of Jenkintown.

00:31.599 --> 00:33.367
TOGETHER: TPOJ!

00:33.434 --> 00:36.937
I think we can all agree
our senior year's been
a complete and utter bust.

00:37.004 --> 00:38.306
I actually had
a real nice year.

00:38.372 --> 00:39.673
I aced AP Bio,

00:39.740 --> 00:42.110
and I really got to know
my pen pal, Yoshi Takanabu.

00:42.176 --> 00:44.078
And I reconnected with
my grandma, Naked Nana.

00:44.145 --> 00:45.479
And even though Erica's
at college,

00:45.546 --> 00:47.115
our love has never been
more rock-solid.

00:47.181 --> 00:48.716
And I'm just happy
to be included.

00:48.782 --> 00:51.752
Ugh. Well,
my whole school year's
been a complete dook fest

00:51.819 --> 00:53.654
'cause my one true love,
Lainey, left me,

00:53.721 --> 00:55.789
and no one in this hellhole
even noticed me.

00:55.856 --> 00:57.558
Hey, Barry.
Everything cool?

00:57.625 --> 01:00.661
I'm talking to some friends,
Jamie Weisman.

01:00.728 --> 01:01.829
So rude.
Unreal.

01:01.895 --> 01:02.930
Agree.
Totally.

01:02.996 --> 01:05.833
Is it?
Lucky for me,
it's prank week.

01:05.899 --> 01:07.401
With my evil brain smarts,

01:07.468 --> 01:11.272
I will finally become
the school legend
I am in my mind.

01:11.339 --> 01:14.475
Couldn't help but overhear
you might be in the market
for a legendary prank.

01:14.542 --> 01:15.809
What's it to you,
douche box?

01:15.876 --> 01:18.112
It just so happens I have
the single best resource

01:18.179 --> 01:20.614
for school prankery
the world has ever seen.

01:20.681 --> 01:22.483
Real Genius.

01:22.550 --> 01:24.285
A filmic ode to shenanigans

01:24.352 --> 01:26.220
where brilliant dreamboat
Val Kilmer

01:26.287 --> 01:28.856
pulls a series of
the most epic pranks
ever seen.

01:28.922 --> 01:31.792
He is a dreamboat,
which is why I'm listening.

01:31.859 --> 01:33.227
Here's a good one.

01:33.294 --> 01:36.197
You take apart a car
and put it back together
in a tiny room.

01:36.264 --> 01:37.465
Unimpressive. Next.

01:37.531 --> 01:39.200
You ice the hallways
so the whole school

01:39.267 --> 01:40.368
becomes a giant
skating rink.

01:40.434 --> 01:41.835
Too easy. Next!

01:41.902 --> 01:43.671
Then go for
the ultimate prank

01:43.737 --> 01:46.874
and fire a NASA laser beam
at a 50-ton Jiffy Pop,

01:46.940 --> 01:48.776
causing
a popcorn avalanche.

01:48.842 --> 01:51.111
No! The good news
is your lame ideas

01:51.179 --> 01:52.813
have given me
an incredible one.

01:52.880 --> 01:54.114
Mother!
What is it, boopie?

01:54.182 --> 01:55.583
I'm in need of
your sewing skills.

01:55.649 --> 01:56.884
On it. What for?

01:56.950 --> 02:00.154
Something so brilliant,
so elaborate,

02:00.221 --> 02:02.556
that the school
will never be the same.

02:03.924 --> 02:08.162
Ha! You got khaki pants!
Khak attack!

02:08.229 --> 02:10.498
You like pranks, huh?
Up here.

02:10.564 --> 02:13.133
Honestly,
I don't even understand
what's comical about this.

02:13.201 --> 02:15.803
Goldberg does it again!
Give me some.

02:15.869 --> 02:17.671
* I'm twisted up inside

02:17.738 --> 02:21.141
* But nonetheless
I feel the need to say

02:23.744 --> 02:25.213
* I don't know the future

02:25.279 --> 02:28.416
* But the past keeps getting
clearer every day *

02:28.482 --> 02:30.418
ADULT ADAM: It was May 16th,
1980-something,

02:30.484 --> 02:32.853
and Erica had officially
dropped out of college.

02:32.920 --> 02:36.089
But for my mom, she was just
happy to have her baby home.

02:36.156 --> 02:38.226
In honor of my
schmoopie-poop's
arrival home

02:38.292 --> 02:39.860
and back into
my loving arms,

02:39.927 --> 02:43.030
I present the most tender
brisket ever brisketed.

02:43.096 --> 02:44.932
How can you brisket
at a time like this?

02:44.998 --> 02:46.900
Dad's about to come home
and lose his mind

02:46.967 --> 02:48.168
when he hears
I dropped out.

02:48.236 --> 02:49.403
That's the point.

02:49.470 --> 02:51.905
I know exactly how
to butter up your father.

02:51.972 --> 02:54.908
You do it with meat
and actual butter.

02:55.809 --> 02:57.110
MURRAY: I'm home!

02:57.177 --> 03:00.214
I hit a lot of personal
and professional lows today,

03:00.281 --> 03:02.283
so give me a wide berth.

03:02.350 --> 03:03.384
Go, go, go.

03:03.451 --> 03:05.319
Work your Mama magic.
I love you.

03:05.386 --> 03:09.089
ADULT ADAM: With that,
my mom lulled my dad
into a rare state of calmness.

03:09.156 --> 03:10.391
Here you go, honey.

03:10.458 --> 03:12.926
Little light brisket snack
to take the edge off.

03:12.993 --> 03:14.428
You just sit there
and enjoy.

03:14.495 --> 03:17.665
Little Mani-shev to help
the meat go down nice.

03:17.731 --> 03:20.268
There you go,
my big tiger.

03:20.334 --> 03:22.570
You just relax those big,
hardworking muscles.

03:22.636 --> 03:25.473
Backy-scratchies
for my man, hmm?

03:25.539 --> 03:27.541
I just pressed
these nails on fresh.

03:28.208 --> 03:29.443
Is he lulled yet?

03:29.510 --> 03:32.313
No!
What is the girl-moron
doing here?

03:32.380 --> 03:35.283
This better not be about
dropping out, so help me.

03:35.349 --> 03:37.050
ADULT ADAM: Yep,
few things were as
important to my dad

03:37.117 --> 03:38.652
as a college education.

03:38.719 --> 03:40.421
You're not skipping out
on college.

03:40.488 --> 03:42.623
You're studying and going
to a good school.

03:42.690 --> 03:44.692
Your whole damn future
depends on it!

03:44.758 --> 03:46.760
Here's a plan... College!

03:46.827 --> 03:48.896
College. College.
College. College.

03:48.962 --> 03:50.331
Don't think of it
as dropping out.

03:50.398 --> 03:52.766
Think of it as me transferring
to your house.

03:52.833 --> 03:55.102
This school rejects
your application.

03:55.168 --> 03:56.236
You go now.

03:56.304 --> 03:57.338
He doesn't mean it,
love bug.

03:57.405 --> 03:58.639
It's the Manischewitz
talking.

03:58.706 --> 03:59.907
Damn right I mean it!

03:59.973 --> 04:02.009
What makes her think she can
move back in here,

04:02.075 --> 04:04.545
eat our food,
sit on our furniture

04:04.612 --> 04:06.013
like she's one
of our children?

04:06.079 --> 04:08.349
She is one of our children,
Murray.

04:08.416 --> 04:09.783
Fine, the dummy can stay

04:09.850 --> 04:12.986
as long as she pays
for food and rent
like a normal person.

04:13.053 --> 04:14.522
I'm putting
my foot down on this.

04:14.588 --> 04:16.023
Come on!
This is my home!

04:16.089 --> 04:18.091
You can't make me pay
for goods and services.

04:18.158 --> 04:20.027
Plus rent.
The foot has spoken.

04:20.093 --> 04:21.395
**

04:22.363 --> 04:24.365
So, like, when exactly

04:24.432 --> 04:26.266
do you tell your dad
I'm living here, too?

04:26.334 --> 04:28.369
Yeah, he didn't
take my news so well,

04:28.436 --> 04:30.838
so I was thinking that
we never tell him

04:30.904 --> 04:33.106
and I sneak you snacks
like a pet turtle.

04:33.173 --> 04:34.342
This is a nightmare,

04:34.408 --> 04:36.344
but I have no options,
so I am a turtle.

04:36.410 --> 04:38.579
Hey! What are you guys
doing in my fart chamber?

04:38.646 --> 04:41.749
This is my room, and we left
college to start our band.

04:41.815 --> 04:43.150
Also, what?
Wait.

04:43.216 --> 04:44.217
Does this mean
Lainey's back

04:44.284 --> 04:45.586
and she threw away
her future, too?

04:45.653 --> 04:47.521
My God, is Lainey
all you care about?

04:47.588 --> 04:48.589
Yes!

04:48.656 --> 04:50.324
Other than losing
my fart chamber,

04:50.391 --> 04:52.326
things are finally
going my way!

04:52.393 --> 04:54.395
We should air
this place out.

04:54.462 --> 04:57.064
ADULT ADAM: And so Barry
raced off to win back
the love of his life

04:57.130 --> 04:59.400
in the most mature,
subtle way possible.

04:59.467 --> 05:02.703
Oh, no! No! No! No!

05:02.770 --> 05:04.905
Good to see you, too,
Mr. Lewis.

05:04.972 --> 05:06.574
I hear Lainey dropped out
of college.

05:06.640 --> 05:08.041
Horrible timing,
Barry!

05:08.108 --> 05:09.510
First you drop out
and break my heart,

05:09.577 --> 05:11.178
and now you bring this
back into my life?

05:11.244 --> 05:13.614
Dark cloud, silver lining...
I hear ya.

05:13.681 --> 05:15.616
Anyhoo, I'm here to ask
your daughter to prom

05:15.683 --> 05:17.184
'cause she just dropped out
of college and all.

05:17.250 --> 05:19.553
Please stop reminding him that
I dropped out of college!

05:19.620 --> 05:21.389
Is all of this
just to hurt me?

05:21.455 --> 05:23.757
Is that what this is?
Dad, go feed the fish.

05:23.824 --> 05:25.726
So good to see
his ol' mug again.

05:25.793 --> 05:27.327
Barry, my life
is in utter chaos,

05:27.395 --> 05:28.729
and you're here
for some dumb prom?

05:28.796 --> 05:31.399
And possibly marriage.
Just floating that out there.

05:31.465 --> 05:33.066
Is that a yes to both?
It's a no!

05:33.133 --> 05:34.234
Everything's
a mess right now.

05:34.301 --> 05:35.903
I'm not even sure my dad
will let me stay here.

05:35.969 --> 05:38.972
So, you really don't
wanna go to prom with me
or elope to Kokomo?

05:39.039 --> 05:41.074
I don't have time to deal
with this high-school drama.

05:41.141 --> 05:42.776
If you need a date so bad,
just go with that girl

05:42.843 --> 05:44.077
that always says "hey"
in the hall.

05:44.144 --> 05:45.879
I don't want to go
with Jamie Weisman!

05:45.946 --> 05:47.748
She was just a stall
until you came back.

05:47.815 --> 05:49.116
My life is stalling!

05:49.182 --> 05:50.918
I was gonna do
amazing things

05:50.984 --> 05:53.220
like take a pottery class
or talk to that lady

05:53.286 --> 05:54.555
that hoses down
the trucks at work.

05:54.622 --> 05:56.790
No one says you can't talk
to the hose woman, Dad!

05:56.857 --> 05:59.059
Keep feeding the fish.
I'm sorry, Bar.

05:59.126 --> 06:00.461
I just can't deal
with us right now.

06:00.528 --> 06:02.830
Take your time.
But before I go,

06:02.896 --> 06:06.099
tell me once and for all
if you're gonna be my
forever lady.

06:06.166 --> 06:08.201
I'll field this one.
Tell me.

06:08.268 --> 06:09.737
BILL: There we go.

06:09.803 --> 06:11.038
ADULT ADAM: While Barry's
romantic plan bit the dust,

06:11.104 --> 06:14.475
Erica was learning what it
meant to be a starving artist.

06:14.542 --> 06:16.309
**

06:16.376 --> 06:20.313
Whatcha working on there?
Black n' white cookie?
Looks fresh.

06:20.380 --> 06:22.416
Help yourself.
I... I got a dozen.

06:22.483 --> 06:23.817
Hold on!

06:23.884 --> 06:26.587
No black n' white cookies
unless you pay for it.

06:26.654 --> 06:29.256
I bet that chews up
real nice.

06:29.322 --> 06:31.625
This is hard to watch.

06:31.692 --> 06:33.961
I think it's delightful.

06:34.027 --> 06:38.866
Pet-store janitor, gas-station
attendant, fish scaler?

06:38.932 --> 06:41.101
ADULT ADAM: Yep,
back before you could
post a resume on LinkedIn,

06:41.168 --> 06:44.672
the only way to find a job
was in this crazy thing
called a newspaper.

06:44.738 --> 06:47.274
This one says
"Wanted: Lady."

06:47.340 --> 06:48.876
You don't wanna call
that number.

06:48.942 --> 06:51.011
I know!

06:51.078 --> 06:53.146
This whole situation
is poop.

06:53.213 --> 06:55.583
There is no world
where I am gonna sit by

06:55.649 --> 06:57.951
and watch my baby
become a fishmonger

06:58.018 --> 06:59.953
or take a job as a lady.

07:00.020 --> 07:02.456
Bevy, she's been at it
for two days.

07:02.523 --> 07:04.458
Erica will find her way.

07:04.525 --> 07:07.595
Or even better,
I find her way for her.

07:07.661 --> 07:09.897
Don't do that.
Murray put his foot down.

07:09.963 --> 07:12.165
Which was great,
and now it's my job

07:12.232 --> 07:14.134
to ever so gently
lift it up.

07:14.201 --> 07:17.037
Nothing about Murray
can be lifted gently.

07:17.104 --> 07:21.374
Believe me, Dad,
I can be very subtle
when I need to be.

07:21.441 --> 07:24.512
Earl. This will not be subtle.
You're helping me.

07:24.578 --> 07:25.913
Wait,
what's happening?

07:25.979 --> 07:27.347
You haven't stormed in here

07:27.414 --> 07:29.783
demanding unreasonable
treatment for your children
all year.

07:29.850 --> 07:31.184
I've been in a Bevolution,

07:31.251 --> 07:33.453
trying to figure out a life
without my kids.

07:33.521 --> 07:35.556
Please,
keep doing that and go.

07:35.623 --> 07:36.924
Forget the Bevolution.

07:36.990 --> 07:39.226
I'm here to make you
hire Erica's band
to play the prom.

07:40.928 --> 07:44.632
You want to pay me to pay
your daughter with your money?

07:44.698 --> 07:47.000
Oh, yeah.

07:47.067 --> 07:49.002
I've missed us,
you know?

07:49.069 --> 07:51.572
ADULT ADAM: As my mom
pulled some strings
to boost Erica's confidence,

07:51.639 --> 07:54.575
Barry's prom plans had
completely unraveled.

07:54.642 --> 07:55.743
It makes no sense.

07:55.809 --> 07:58.111
What 19-year-old
college dropout

07:58.178 --> 08:00.180
doesn't want to go back
to her high

08:00.247 --> 08:01.682
Why don't you just tag along
with me and Andy?

08:01.749 --> 08:04.251
Yeah, it's our second year
going stag as a couple.

08:04.317 --> 08:07.220
No. I'm not gonna be
the third wheel
on your stag date.

08:07.287 --> 08:09.489
Either I go with Lainey,
or I don't go at all.

08:09.557 --> 08:10.691
So, you're not going?

08:10.758 --> 08:12.826
If don't go,
I'll forever ruin my rep

08:12.893 --> 08:14.928
as one of Jenkintown's
top five party people.

08:14.995 --> 08:17.264
So, you are going?

08:17.330 --> 08:18.498
Without Lainey, never!

08:18.566 --> 08:19.767
So, you're not going?

08:19.833 --> 08:22.135
And be forever known
as a prom

08:22.202 --> 08:25.138
So, you're both going
and not going?

08:25.205 --> 08:26.239
Gah!

08:26.306 --> 08:28.408
Stop asking
dumb questions

08:28.475 --> 08:30.143
and provide
a solution for once!

08:32.613 --> 08:35.282
ADULT ADAM: But
instead of answers,
all Barry got was crickets.

08:35.348 --> 08:36.416
Literally.

08:36.483 --> 08:38.852
As you all are now
painfully aware,

08:38.919 --> 08:42.590
Mr. Atkins has released
a duffel bag full of
live crickets

08:42.656 --> 08:43.824
throughout the school.

08:43.891 --> 08:46.226
I am a legend!

08:46.293 --> 08:48.796
No! No! No!

08:48.862 --> 08:50.163
No!

08:50.230 --> 08:52.800
Hear this now.

08:52.866 --> 08:57.771
The next person to do
a senior prank will be
banned from prom.

09:00.007 --> 09:02.409
ADULT ADAM: In that moment,
Barry saw the perfect way
to avoid prom altogether.

09:02.475 --> 09:04.411
No one would call him
a dateless loser.

09:04.477 --> 09:06.647
They'd call him
a pranking legend.

09:06.714 --> 09:08.481
Hey, my thing!
Forget your thing!

09:08.548 --> 09:10.217
This is important.

09:10.283 --> 09:12.085
You know that movie
I introduced you to
when you told me about it?

09:12.152 --> 09:13.320
You mean Real Genius?

09:13.386 --> 09:15.155
The movie on my shirt
and poster?

09:15.222 --> 09:17.625
I think it's time we take
a page from their prank book,

09:17.691 --> 09:19.192
but I can't do it
without your help.

09:19.259 --> 09:20.961
Yes!
I'm essential now!

09:21.028 --> 09:22.896
Thank you for the opportunity
to live my dream.

09:22.963 --> 09:24.297
You don't know
how much this means.

09:24.364 --> 09:25.766
**

09:25.833 --> 09:27.434
Bar, wait up!

09:27.500 --> 09:31.905
Behold, our principal's
prized Suzuki Samurai!

09:31.972 --> 09:33.674
Over the next
9 to 12 minutes,

09:33.741 --> 09:35.909
we shall take it apart
piece by piece,

09:35.976 --> 09:37.811
then quickly reassemble it
in his office.

09:37.878 --> 09:39.747
Dude, we can't just
take a car apart.

09:39.813 --> 09:40.914
It's not made of Legos.

09:40.981 --> 09:43.617
Which is why I brought
this Allen wrench.

09:43.684 --> 09:45.218
Time to become a legend.

09:45.285 --> 09:47.087
ADULT ADAM: As much as
I loved Real Genius,

09:47.154 --> 09:49.256
my brother was not one.

09:51.558 --> 09:55.462
Erica had been a college
dropout for a whole week,
and nothing was going her way.

09:55.528 --> 09:57.530
That is,
until my mom stepped in.

09:57.597 --> 10:00.634
Holy crap and hell yes!
We'll be there!

10:00.701 --> 10:02.636
That was
Principal Earl J. Ball

10:02.703 --> 10:05.873
offering me a job
playing prom.
Yay!

10:05.939 --> 10:08.541
When I said, "Get a job,"
I meant get a real job.

10:08.608 --> 10:11.244
He's paying me $1,000.
Real enough, old man?

10:11.311 --> 10:12.545
Actually,
none of this seems real.

10:12.612 --> 10:14.982
You know, this is a classic
rock 'n' roll tale.

10:15.048 --> 10:16.750
Drop out of college,
start a band,

10:16.817 --> 10:19.987
and immediately get paid
too much for a gig
you didn't even look for.

10:20.053 --> 10:22.555
Oh, I can't believe my angel
got her first job.

10:22.622 --> 10:24.825
Oh-ho-ho,
I love you so much.

10:24.892 --> 10:26.827
Thank you so much
for believing in me.

10:26.894 --> 10:30.397
And thank you for this cookie
because I just got paid.

10:30.463 --> 10:34.167
We got paid!
Deal with it!
Who the hell is this?

10:34.234 --> 10:38.271
I'm in her band
and also live here now,
so start a tab for me, too.

10:38.338 --> 10:40.573
Take it all.
You deserve it.

10:40.640 --> 10:43.210
Oh, Murray,

10:43.276 --> 10:45.813
my baby
and her strange-sounding
friend really did it.

10:45.879 --> 10:47.614
They went out
and got a job.

10:47.681 --> 10:50.617
You did this.
Why did you go
behind my back?

10:50.684 --> 10:52.185
I put my foot down!

10:52.252 --> 10:53.754
Erica doesn't need
your foot, Murray.

10:53.821 --> 10:57.057
She needs loving mama arms to
hold her in her time of need.

10:57.124 --> 10:58.692
You can't ignore
the foot.

10:58.759 --> 11:01.862
If the foot has no power,
the whole system breaks down.

11:01.929 --> 11:04.564
I'm sorry I went behind
your back and foot, okay?

11:04.631 --> 11:05.933
But trust me.

11:05.999 --> 11:07.567
Getting Erica this job
is gonna give her

11:07.634 --> 11:09.269
the boost of confidence
she needs.

11:09.336 --> 11:12.740
Gonna hit the mall
and buy some new sexy boots
to wear on stage.

11:12.806 --> 11:14.708
Rock 'n' roll. So easy.

11:15.608 --> 11:17.677
See? She's...

11:18.812 --> 11:21.949
Very confident.
I did that.

11:22.015 --> 11:24.584
ADULT ADAM: As my mom
foolishly filled Erica
with confidence,

11:24.651 --> 11:28.856
one could say
Barry's big prank
didn't fully come together.

11:28.922 --> 11:30.557
You've done it now,
people!

11:30.623 --> 11:33.293
Until the perp is caught
or comes forward,

11:33.360 --> 11:35.495
prom is canceled.

11:36.830 --> 11:39.199
What? No. Don't let one
horrible human being

11:39.266 --> 11:40.734
ruin it for all of us!
BARRY: Yeah!

11:40.801 --> 11:45.105
I'm so angry at your harmless
prank gone wrong.
Me as well!

11:45.172 --> 11:48.041
Yeah, I've been doing
this a long time.

11:48.108 --> 11:50.243
And it's safe to say
this is the work

11:50.310 --> 11:53.981
of a true monster
who belongs behind bars.

11:54.047 --> 11:55.916
Whoever did this,
turn yourself in!

11:55.983 --> 11:58.451
Yeah, you big
prom-ruining jerk.

11:58.518 --> 12:02.089
We're now going to run away
to find some clues. Bye.

12:02.155 --> 12:03.791
We looked for nothing.

12:03.857 --> 12:06.059
Instead, we stupidly got ready
for a life on the lam.

12:06.126 --> 12:07.761
Lainey,
we got to talk.

12:07.828 --> 12:09.096
Thank God
you came back.

12:09.162 --> 12:11.231
I have so much awesome stuff
to tell you.
No time!

12:11.298 --> 12:12.800
I'm here to tell you
how I really feel

12:12.866 --> 12:14.334
just in case I never
see you again.

12:14.401 --> 12:17.537
There's the big man!
Hey, get in here.

12:17.604 --> 12:19.339
Let's flex those
huggin' muscles.

12:19.406 --> 12:21.508
What's happening?

12:21.574 --> 12:23.710
Why is everyone suddenly
so happy to see me?

12:23.777 --> 12:25.478
Things have really
turned around over here.

12:25.545 --> 12:26.847
I spoke to the hose lady.

12:26.914 --> 12:29.482
She is not interested,
but at least I have closure.

12:29.549 --> 12:31.418
We got our first gig.
That's why I wanted to talk.

12:31.484 --> 12:33.253
I... I'm sorry I was putting
all my stress on you.

12:33.320 --> 12:35.155
No! You were right!

12:35.222 --> 12:38.525
I'm not the same naive boy
who knocked on your door
yesterday.

12:38.591 --> 12:41.561
I'm a hardened man
with real grown-up problems.

12:41.628 --> 12:43.730
I mean, they canceled prom,
and I don't even care.

12:43.797 --> 12:45.165
What?
Prom was canceled?

12:45.232 --> 12:46.533
Oh, no!
What?

12:46.599 --> 12:48.168
What'd I say?
That's my gig!

12:48.235 --> 12:50.070
We were getting paid
a thousand bucks for it!

12:50.137 --> 12:52.973
I didn't know you were getting
wildly overpaid to play prom.
No one told me.

12:53.040 --> 12:55.542
Prom was the only
glimmer of hope I had.

12:55.608 --> 12:58.345
We have no glimmer.
We've lost our glimmer.

12:58.411 --> 13:01.548
Oh, no!
Thanks for nothing.

13:01.614 --> 13:04.651
ADULT ADAM: That day,
the news about prom
traveled like lightning,

13:04.717 --> 13:06.653
but my sister
would be struck the hardest.

13:06.719 --> 13:10.023
Hey, Mom, what do you think
about these bad boys?

13:10.090 --> 13:12.392
Gotta spend money
to make money, am I right?

13:12.459 --> 13:15.528
Um, baby, sit down. I've got
some bad news about prom.

13:15.595 --> 13:17.230
As much as it hurt,

13:17.297 --> 13:20.300
my mom had to tell the truth
and break her baby's heart.

13:20.367 --> 13:22.469
It was canceled.
No prom.

13:24.371 --> 13:26.073
So, no gig.

13:27.540 --> 13:29.609
**

13:29.676 --> 13:31.244
Eh, another school
will hire us.

13:31.611 --> 13:33.346
Um,

13:33.413 --> 13:36.716
those calls might not come in
as easily as you think.

13:36.783 --> 13:40.420
See, I might have paid
Principal Ball to hire you.

13:40.487 --> 13:41.855
I'm so sorry.

13:41.922 --> 13:43.857
Sorry? This is sweet.
What?

13:43.924 --> 13:46.426
All you gotta do is pay
another school to hire me.

13:46.493 --> 13:48.361
I'm not gonna do that.
You're right.

13:48.428 --> 13:50.697
Let's just cut out
the middle man.
Just pay me directly.

13:50.763 --> 13:52.065
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

13:52.132 --> 13:53.867
I see how that
would be easier

13:53.934 --> 13:56.703
than accepting every single
adult responsibility.

13:56.769 --> 13:58.505
I'm glad
we're on the same page.

13:58.571 --> 14:00.773
Anyway, I'm gonna go
take a nap in the bath.

14:00.840 --> 14:04.511
Or, instead of napping,
you could open a newspaper

14:04.577 --> 14:06.179
and see if there's
anything there for you.

14:06.246 --> 14:08.949
Why would I want help?
I got you, silly Mom.

14:09.016 --> 14:11.618
No, I'm putting
my foot down!

14:11.684 --> 14:14.354
I love you so much,
but I will throw your

14:14.421 --> 14:16.456
right out onto
our suburban street.

14:16.523 --> 14:17.958
Um, isn't that
Dad's thing?

14:18.025 --> 14:19.392
I've got a foot,
too, missy!

14:19.459 --> 14:22.095
Homegirl's gonna find out what
it means to work for a living.

14:22.162 --> 14:24.197
So, you better get ready
to sew some buttons

14:24.264 --> 14:27.300
and hot-tar some roofs
and tend to them chickens!

14:27.367 --> 14:29.102
What era do you have
me working in?

14:29.169 --> 14:30.303
What's with all
the yelling?

14:30.370 --> 14:31.671
Mom put her foot down.

14:31.738 --> 14:33.573
Really?
And that's not all!

14:33.640 --> 14:34.908
I want the boots.

14:34.975 --> 14:37.210
But I earned these boots
with my potential!

14:37.277 --> 14:38.578
You can go barefoot
until you learn

14:38.645 --> 14:40.580
how to make
an honest paycheck.

14:40.647 --> 14:43.150
So I'm gonna take all your
shoes, all your clothes,

14:43.216 --> 14:45.252
your pillows,
and your vitamins!

14:45.318 --> 14:48.788
Okay, she's new at this,
so it's not making sense,
but you... You get it.

14:48.855 --> 14:50.690
I am so angry,
and I can't stop yelling!

14:55.996 --> 14:58.831
ADULT ADAM: Barry knew
it was up to him
to make Lainey happy,

14:58.898 --> 15:00.333
even if it meant
going to jail.

15:00.400 --> 15:01.935
It was me.
I'm sorry?

15:02.002 --> 15:03.470
No, I am.

15:03.536 --> 15:06.573
In a childish effort
to avoid prom,
I Val Kilmered your car.

15:06.639 --> 15:09.776
I see. Well...

15:09.842 --> 15:12.980
Quite a surprise
and disappointment.

15:13.046 --> 15:14.781
We're good here.
What?

15:14.847 --> 15:16.049
Don't you have to
call the police?

15:16.116 --> 15:18.285
Do I?
Do I?

15:18.351 --> 15:19.987
'Cause that'd be a hard
phone call to make.

15:20.053 --> 15:22.555
Mr. Goldberg,
look out the window
and tell me what you see.

15:23.723 --> 15:25.858
A fly-ass
T

15:25.925 --> 15:28.628
And do you have any idea
who that car belongs to?

15:28.695 --> 15:29.997
That awesome dude Randy

15:30.063 --> 15:32.132
who always wears
the flip
No.

15:32.199 --> 15:34.767
That cool sub who's always
teaching with rap lyrics?
No.

15:34.834 --> 15:36.069
Charles Barkley?
No.

15:36.136 --> 15:38.471
Power couple Burt Reynolds
and Loni Anderson?

15:38.538 --> 15:40.540
No.
The lead singer of UB40?

15:40.607 --> 15:42.309
No.
The cast of Benson?

15:42.375 --> 15:45.145
No.
Bo Jackson's cousin Todd,
Todd Jackson?

15:45.212 --> 15:46.213
No.
Jermaine Jackson?

15:46.279 --> 15:47.614
No!
Bo knows Todd.

15:47.680 --> 15:50.383
No, me! Me, me!
It's my car!

15:50.450 --> 15:51.618
And you know
how I got it?

15:51.684 --> 15:53.620
Because the old aluminum can
I was driving

15:53.686 --> 15:55.822
was vandalized
by a "criminal"

15:55.888 --> 15:58.858
and insurance paid
for the Fiero,
no questions asked.

15:58.925 --> 16:00.693
But... I don't...
No questions asked.
No questions asked.

16:00.760 --> 16:02.729
Wha... I don't... The...
No questions. Zip. Zip!

16:02.795 --> 16:03.997
Eh...
Zip!

16:04.064 --> 16:05.632
So, does this mean
prom is back on?

16:05.698 --> 16:08.668
For everyone but you.
Consider it your punishment.

16:08.735 --> 16:12.472
But also, thank you
for the boss new ride.

16:14.607 --> 16:16.943
Good news, Quakers.
Prom is back on.

16:17.010 --> 16:19.912
(BOSTON'S MORE THAN
A FEELING PLAYS)

16:19.979 --> 16:22.649
ADULT ADAM: That day,
my brother really was a hero,

16:22.715 --> 16:24.217
even though no one would
ever know it.

16:24.284 --> 16:25.952
Guys, this is bad.

16:26.019 --> 16:28.355
My mom put her foot down,
which means I gotta move in
with Lainey.

16:28.421 --> 16:30.957
No. My dad kicked me out.
I came here to live with you.

16:31.024 --> 16:32.892
How did we blow this so bad?

16:32.959 --> 16:34.594
Hey, guess what.
Prom's back on.

16:34.661 --> 16:36.829
What?
How is that
even possible?

16:36.896 --> 16:40.267
You didn't hear it from me,
but Barry took the fall
so you could play prom.

16:40.333 --> 16:42.235
* I lost myself
in a familiar song

16:42.302 --> 16:43.870
Why would
he do that for me?

16:43.936 --> 16:46.739
'Cause the people who
care about you most

16:46.806 --> 16:49.076
would do anything
to make you happy.

16:49.142 --> 16:51.211
ADULT ADAM: That's
the crazy thing about life.

16:51.278 --> 16:52.745
Just when
you're at your lowest

16:52.812 --> 16:54.847
and think that things
can't get any worse,

16:54.914 --> 16:58.051
the people who truly love you
find a way to
get you back on top.

16:58.118 --> 17:00.019
I took away
her vitamins.

17:00.953 --> 17:04.324
Her Flintstones Chewables.

17:04.391 --> 17:08.261
Now she's a teeny-tiny bit
less nourished because of me.

17:08.328 --> 17:10.097
Okay, I think
you've had enough.

17:10.163 --> 17:14.000
Hey. I have some good news.
Prom's back on again.

17:14.067 --> 17:15.802
God, no.
No, no.

17:15.868 --> 17:18.004
This time we're just
getting paid $10,

17:18.071 --> 17:20.006
but you gotta start
somewhere, right?

17:20.073 --> 17:22.242
Can't buy a lot of
black n' white cookies
for that.

17:22.309 --> 17:25.778
That's why tomorrow
I'm gonna find a real job
and pay you rent.

17:26.946 --> 17:28.981
And I never said this,

17:29.048 --> 17:32.119
but thank you for getting us
our first paid gig.

17:32.185 --> 17:35.655
Oh, don't thank me.
Not after I tried to take
your boots and bedding.

17:35.722 --> 17:38.991
No, I deserved it.
It's just...

17:39.058 --> 17:44.797
All your support and hugs
and love made me feel so safe.

17:44.864 --> 17:46.099
Too safe.

17:46.166 --> 17:48.135
* So many people
have come and gone

17:48.201 --> 17:50.337
I just wanted to hide out here
with people who love me.

17:52.205 --> 17:54.274
But I can't do that anymore.

17:54.341 --> 17:56.509
* Yet I still recall
as I wander on

17:56.576 --> 17:58.845
No matter what happens,

17:58.911 --> 18:02.315
this house will always
be a safe place for you.

18:02.382 --> 18:03.416
You mean it?

18:04.151 --> 18:05.818
I do.

18:05.885 --> 18:08.355
I'm putting my foot down.

18:08.421 --> 18:11.791
ADULT ADAM: Truth is,
when you're surrounded
by your family and friends,

18:11.858 --> 18:13.660
it's much easier
to face the music.

18:13.726 --> 18:17.364
* It's more than a feeling

18:17.430 --> 18:21.534
* When I hear that old song
they used to play

18:21.601 --> 18:23.102
That's my prom date!
I swear!

18:23.170 --> 18:26.038
* And I begin dreaming

18:26.105 --> 18:29.041
* Till I see Marianne
walk away

18:29.108 --> 18:31.010
Oh.
Look at her, Mur.

18:31.077 --> 18:32.645
She's so grown up.

18:32.712 --> 18:34.581
God, everything's changed.

18:34.647 --> 18:36.115
Or not.

18:36.183 --> 18:37.850
We still got three kids
in the house.

18:37.917 --> 18:41.020
For now.
But I'll take it.

18:41.087 --> 18:42.889
ADULT ADAM: There's nothing
scarier than growing up,

18:42.955 --> 18:45.558
not just for us kids,
for our parents, too.

18:45.625 --> 18:47.327
But no matter how old you are,

18:47.394 --> 18:50.230
what gets you through is
knowing that you're not alone.

18:50.297 --> 18:52.199
Hey.
Hey.

18:54.100 --> 18:56.035
How did you know
I was here?

18:56.102 --> 18:59.439
Come on. This is where
you spent all your dances
before we got together.

18:59.506 --> 19:01.441
Wish I could be there
for your first gig.

19:01.508 --> 19:03.576
I know. And I wish I could
be your prom date.

19:03.643 --> 19:06.213
But you said that...
I know what I said.

19:06.279 --> 19:07.347
One dance.
Better make it fast.

19:07.414 --> 19:08.515
Erica needs me.

19:10.049 --> 19:11.384
* Their faces fade
as the years go by

19:11.451 --> 19:13.853
Did you ever think
we'd come back here again?

19:13.920 --> 19:16.689
I really didn't,
but I'm really happy we did.

19:18.325 --> 19:19.992
Happy enough to marry me?

19:23.830 --> 19:28.067
This is for you, girl.
I "pick" you.

19:29.001 --> 19:31.170
**

19:38.144 --> 19:39.446
For sure.

19:40.980 --> 19:42.449
Is that a "yes"?

19:42.515 --> 19:44.417
You never say yes.

19:44.484 --> 19:46.085
I'm saying it this time.

19:46.152 --> 19:48.555
Yes. I'll marry you,
you big dummy.

19:48.621 --> 19:52.024
I'm a high-school senior who's
gonna marry a college dropout!

19:52.091 --> 19:54.494
This year
turned out awesome!

19:54.561 --> 20:00.767
* More than a feeling
Till I see Marianne
walk away *

20:00.833 --> 20:02.335
We're getting married!

20:02.402 --> 20:03.803
Whoo!

20:03.870 --> 20:05.104
**

20:05.171 --> 20:06.439
Did he just say that...

20:06.506 --> 20:07.740
Tomorrow's problem.

20:08.541 --> 20:12.679
**

20:12.745 --> 20:16.416
ADULT ADAM: When I look back,
it really was a year
filled with so many changes.

20:16.483 --> 20:18.251
There was the Bevolution,

20:18.318 --> 20:21.321
my sister defied my dad
to follow her
rock 'n' roll dreams,

20:21.388 --> 20:25.925
and, of course, Barry's
misguided engagement
the day Lainey came back.

20:25.992 --> 20:29.529
Sure, all those details from
1980-something fade over time,

20:29.596 --> 20:32.064
but the love my family shares
was real

20:32.131 --> 20:33.833
and would last forever.

20:33.900 --> 20:35.702
And the crazy thing is,

20:35.768 --> 20:39.005
the biggest changes
were yet to come.

20:39.071 --> 20:40.307
**

20:44.176 --> 20:45.478
I look like Babs?

20:45.545 --> 20:47.013
MURRAY: Total Streisand.

20:47.079 --> 20:49.782
REESE: Welcome to the battle
of the JTPs!

20:49.849 --> 20:51.951
Eight ball, corner pocket.
Eight ball, corner pocket.

20:52.018 --> 20:53.620
Ugh!
Ugh!

20:53.686 --> 20:55.121
Hey, boopie.
It's Mama.

20:55.187 --> 20:57.123
Adam, this is the third time
I've called.

20:57.189 --> 20:58.491
Please pick up
the phone.

20:58.558 --> 21:01.193
If I don't hear from you soon,
I'm getting on the next plane.

21:01.260 --> 21:02.629
Call me!

21:07.767 --> 21:09.035
Hey, Ball.

21:09.101 --> 21:11.003
Sounds like you didn't
quite get all them crickets.

21:11.070 --> 21:12.305
Ha, you tried to fix it,

21:12.372 --> 21:14.206
but you didn't,
which is hilarious.

21:14.273 --> 21:15.508
Enjoy yourself, kids.

21:15.575 --> 21:18.210
After today, prank week
is officially over.

21:19.712 --> 21:22.682
Gotta admit, Atkins, that
cricket prank was pretty good.

21:22.749 --> 21:24.651
Face it, Goldberg,
I'm a legend.

21:24.717 --> 21:26.753
Well, let's not get
carried away, hmm?

21:28.421 --> 21:30.957
Oh, sweet God!
Not the Fiero!
