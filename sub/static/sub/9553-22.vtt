01:58.870 --> 02:00.870
You got to keep them closed
until Fonzie gets here.

02:00.870 --> 02:02.370
(sighing):
Oh.

02:02.370 --> 02:04.370
Hey, greet-amundo!

02:04.370 --> 02:05.380
Fonzie,
cover your eyes.

02:05.380 --> 02:06.960
Cover my eyes, all right.

02:06.960 --> 02:08.039
Sit down.

02:08.039 --> 02:10.550
How can I sit down if I
can't see where I'm going?

02:10.550 --> 02:12.550
Come on.
Easy does it.

02:13.050 --> 02:14.050
There you are.
Thanks.

02:14.050 --> 02:15.840
Okay, everybody
can open your eyes.

02:18.090 --> 02:20.590
Well, why did we have
our eyes closed?

02:20.590 --> 02:21.470
Look.

02:22.890 --> 02:25.900
On the counter,
there is a bag of garbage.

02:25.900 --> 02:27.430
How did that
get there?

02:27.430 --> 02:29.020
That's a good trick, Dad.

02:29.520 --> 02:31.020
Oh, yeah, listen, next
time tell me in advance,

02:31.020 --> 02:33.520
I'll bring all my friends over;
we'll laugh hysterically.

02:33.520 --> 02:35.770
All right, will everybody
just calm down please?
All right.

02:35.770 --> 02:38.360
Marion, would you bring
the garbage over here please?

02:38.360 --> 02:40.860
Howard, I'm not
having fun.

02:40.860 --> 02:42.530
Who is?

02:42.530 --> 02:43.610
That's it?

02:43.610 --> 02:45.620
That's-that's what we
all closed our eyes for?

02:45.620 --> 02:47.620
Look, will you just calm down
for a minute please?

02:47.620 --> 02:49.450
Marion, I want you to bring
the garbage over here.

02:49.450 --> 02:50.540
Right over here.

02:52.590 --> 02:54.340
Good!

02:54.340 --> 02:57.930
(laughter)

02:57.930 --> 03:01.430
Dad, I think maybe you better
go upstairs and take a rest.

03:01.430 --> 03:02.430
(laughter)

03:02.430 --> 03:03.930
It's not funny.

03:03.930 --> 03:05.940
Now look at this rug, and
I've got to pick it up.

03:05.940 --> 03:07.940
No, no, no, no, no!
Leave it alone,

03:07.940 --> 03:08.940
That's clean garbage.

03:08.940 --> 03:10.440
I just picked it fresh.

03:10.440 --> 03:11.520
Picked it fresh?

03:11.520 --> 03:13.530
Maybe I better go upstairs
and take a little rest.

03:13.530 --> 03:14.530
(laughs)

03:14.530 --> 03:16.030
I've been breaking
myself up all week.

03:16.030 --> 03:16.950
(laughter)

03:18.620 --> 03:20.700
All right, everybody come
over here and gather around.

03:20.700 --> 03:22.200
I want to show you
some plans.
Oh, come on, Dad.

03:22.200 --> 03:25.210
Come on,
right over here.

03:25.210 --> 03:28.210
Now then, it has always been

03:28.210 --> 03:31.290
my secret ambition
to be an inventor.

03:31.290 --> 03:32.830
You never told me that.

03:32.830 --> 03:33.910
It was a secret.

03:33.910 --> 03:35.500
Oh.

03:35.500 --> 03:36.750
Oh, I'm gonna
clean up that garbage.

03:36.750 --> 03:39.340
Now, just sit down,
Marion, please.

03:39.340 --> 03:42.340
Now, exactly two weeks ago,
the same thing happened to me

03:42.340 --> 03:43.890
that just happened to Mother.

03:43.890 --> 03:45.760
Is this your idea
of revenge?

03:48.060 --> 03:50.560
And I suddenly thought
to myself, I mean,

03:50.560 --> 03:53.070
in this day and age,
here we are in the '50s,

03:53.570 --> 03:56.070
that a person should not
have to carry the garbage out

03:56.070 --> 03:57.570
15 times a week.

03:57.570 --> 03:59.070
Hey, you know,
I totally agree.

03:59.070 --> 04:00.570
That's why I never
have the same chick

04:00.570 --> 04:03.440
pick up garbage, take
it out twice in a row.

04:04.990 --> 04:06.080
Oh, that's good, good.

04:06.080 --> 04:07.080
Thank you,
thank you.

04:07.080 --> 04:09.080
Well, anyway, I thought
that there should be

04:09.080 --> 04:11.580
some way to sort of keep it
in the kitchen, you know?

04:11.580 --> 04:13.590
Sort of push it
all together.

04:13.590 --> 04:15.090
And maybe only take it out
once or twice a week.

04:15.090 --> 04:16.459
You know what I mean?

04:16.459 --> 04:18.040
Sure.

04:18.040 --> 04:19.540
It's called piling
it up in the corner.

04:19.540 --> 04:21.130
(laughs)

04:21.130 --> 04:24.630
No, I mean putting it in
some kind of a special container

04:24.630 --> 04:26.770
and-and squeezing it
all together.

04:26.770 --> 04:28.550
Oh, yuck, Dad!

04:28.550 --> 04:31.140
I can't believe we're having
this conversation.

04:33.140 --> 04:34.140
I can't stand it.

04:34.140 --> 04:35.440
I've got to clean up
that garbage.

04:35.440 --> 04:37.030
Hey, I'll tell you
something, Mrs. C.,

04:37.030 --> 04:39.530
I think the Big H. here's
got the right idea.

04:39.530 --> 04:41.900
I think what you're
talking about, if I get it,

04:41.900 --> 04:43.980
is that you want to
squeeze it all together

04:43.980 --> 04:47.990
like they do with old cars
when they put them to rest.

04:47.990 --> 04:49.490
Exact-amundo!

04:49.490 --> 04:50.490
Whoa!

04:52.960 --> 04:54.960
Hey, hey, Dad, you know,
it's too bad you don't have

04:54.960 --> 04:57.880
some, uh, big corporation
behind this idea, you know?

04:57.880 --> 04:59.470
Why do I need a big corporation?

04:59.470 --> 05:01.970
Listen, all of the great
inventions in life

05:01.970 --> 05:02.970
have been by the little man.

05:02.970 --> 05:04.420
You know the Wright Brothers?

05:04.420 --> 05:06.970
They invented the airplane
in their own bicycle shop.

05:06.970 --> 05:08.470
Yeah, but they were
just trying to build

05:08.470 --> 05:11.890
a very wide bicycle
and it took off.

05:11.890 --> 05:13.480
And Jenny Piccolo,

05:13.480 --> 05:15.570
she invented the first
see-through nightie.

05:15.570 --> 05:17.150
Marion.

05:17.150 --> 05:21.150
I don't wear a
see-through nightie.

05:21.150 --> 05:23.160
Will you talk
to Joanie, please?

05:23.160 --> 05:25.580
Dear, I'm sure
you're wrong.

05:25.580 --> 05:28.160
It was a man named
Frederick in Hollywood.

05:30.500 --> 05:31.580
Well, Fonzie, what do
you think of the plans?

05:31.580 --> 05:33.080
Uh, I'll tell you, see,

05:33.080 --> 05:35.080
I think they're very good
for a start, Mr. C.

05:35.080 --> 05:36.090
What do you mean "for a start"?

05:36.090 --> 05:37.090
I'm all ready to build it.

05:37.590 --> 05:39.090
Oh, well,
you can build this, you know,

05:39.090 --> 05:40.090
but it ain't going
to work.

05:40.090 --> 05:42.130
What? Why
won't it work?

05:42.130 --> 05:43.210
Well, right here,
the spring action

05:43.210 --> 05:44.210
ain't going to make it,
you know?

05:44.210 --> 05:45.680
Well, what else
am I going to use?

05:45.680 --> 05:47.210
Hydraulic lifts.

05:47.210 --> 05:48.300
Really?

05:48.300 --> 05:50.300
Oh, yeah,
the cylinders right in there.

05:50.300 --> 05:52.390
You know, um, uh,
on, on a garage floor,

05:52.390 --> 05:54.390
you got
the hydraulic lift, right?

05:54.390 --> 05:56.860
You press a button,
it kind of raises the car up?

05:56.860 --> 06:01.190
Yeah.
Well, with garbage,
instead of raise, push.

06:01.190 --> 06:04.030
Hey, Dad, I think that's
your solution right there.

06:04.030 --> 06:07.120
Oh, boy, hydraulics-- I
don't know much about that.

06:07.120 --> 06:09.040
I'm not very good
with my hands.

06:09.040 --> 06:10.570
Oh, I wouldn't say that.
Marion.

06:13.710 --> 06:16.790
He's, uh, great at card tricks.

06:20.800 --> 06:23.800
Dad, why don't you just
get, uh, Fonzie to help you?

06:23.800 --> 06:25.300
He's great
with his hands.

06:25.300 --> 06:26.300
He's a mechanical genius.

06:26.300 --> 06:27.300
Heyyy.

06:27.300 --> 06:28.810

06:28.810 --> 06:29.760
Well, how about
it, Fonzie?

06:30.310 --> 06:31.310
You want to work
on this together?

06:31.310 --> 06:33.310
Look, gentlemen,
I am very busy.

06:33.310 --> 06:35.810
I don't think I
have the time, huh?

06:35.810 --> 06:37.310
Oh, Fonz?
Yeah?

06:37.310 --> 06:41.320
Uh, you know, you, you really
should go in on it with Dad.

06:41.320 --> 06:42.600
Why?

06:42.600 --> 06:45.190
Why, Dad?

06:45.190 --> 06:47.190
Talk.
Oh.

06:47.190 --> 06:49.360
Well, golly,
gee, Fonz.
Oh, for...

06:49.360 --> 06:50.780
I mean,

06:50.780 --> 06:53.360
it's the, uh, the thrill
of... of invention,

06:53.360 --> 06:57.170
the, the excitement of it, and,
uh, and you'd be great at it.

06:57.170 --> 06:58.250
Yeah.
Really...

06:58.250 --> 06:59.590
Really good.
...you could help Howard,

06:59.590 --> 07:01.090

face like that down?

what I can do, huh?

09:12.590 --> 09:14.050
Boys...

09:14.050 --> 09:16.590
Mr. C., this looks
perfect to me.

09:16.590 --> 09:17.590
Now what's
the problem?

09:17.590 --> 09:19.090
Now, listen, Fonzie.

09:19.090 --> 09:20.680
In just two days we've
got an appointment

09:20.680 --> 09:22.180
to demonstrate
this machine,

09:22.180 --> 09:24.180
and this part here that's
supposed to move,

09:24.180 --> 09:25.230
it doesn't move.

09:25.230 --> 09:26.820
Well, I see the problem--
it's not connected.

09:26.820 --> 09:28.100
I'll fix it for you.

09:28.100 --> 09:29.690
When?
When? I don't know.

09:29.690 --> 09:31.150
I got a date right now,
soon, huh?

09:31.150 --> 09:32.190
Send her home.

09:32.190 --> 09:34.190
Here, sweetheart,
you run along,

09:34.190 --> 09:35.190
Fonzie's gonna be
very busy now.

09:35.190 --> 09:36.160
Ho, ho, ho,
ho, ho.

09:36.160 --> 09:38.190
Hey! Now, excuse me,

09:38.190 --> 09:39.700
Mr. C., all right,
for one minute?

09:39.700 --> 09:42.200
(snaps fingers)
Richie... my office.

09:42.200 --> 09:44.700
Uh, do yourself a favor,
have a malted, okay?

09:44.700 --> 09:45.700
I don't want
a malted.

09:45.700 --> 09:47.700
Eileen, dance with him.

09:47.700 --> 09:49.120
I don't want to dance.

09:50.590 --> 09:52.680
♪ ♪

09:52.680 --> 09:55.180
♪ Dream ♪

09:55.180 --> 09:57.180
♪ Dream, dream, dream ♪

09:57.180 --> 09:58.880
♪ Dream... ♪

09:58.880 --> 10:01.470
Is it safe to leave
your chick alone with
my dad out there?

10:01.470 --> 10:02.470
Let me tell you
something, Red.

10:02.470 --> 10:04.470
I am not safe
with your father.

10:04.470 --> 10:06.970
He is going berserko
with his Garbage Gulper.

10:06.970 --> 10:08.470
Can you dig it?
Yeah, I know.

10:08.470 --> 10:10.480
He means well,
but he's really starting to,

10:10.480 --> 10:11.440
starting
to drive me crazy.

10:11.440 --> 10:12.530
Yeah, I gotta tell
you something,

10:12.530 --> 10:13.530
I don't care what he's
doing for you.

10:13.530 --> 10:14.780
You're the one that
got me into

10:14.780 --> 10:15.870
this mess, huh?

10:15.870 --> 10:19.370
(imitating Richie):
"Oh, golly gee, Fonz.

10:19.370 --> 10:22.370
"Oh come on,
be an inventor.

10:22.370 --> 10:24.370
"Oh golly, gee, Fonz.

10:24.370 --> 10:26.630
Oh, come on,
just-just be a partner."

10:26.630 --> 10:29.330
I only said one
"Golly, gee."

10:29.330 --> 10:31.410
Do you know that
he sent Eileen home?

10:31.410 --> 10:33.000
That's nothing.
That's nothing?

10:33.000 --> 10:34.970
He's got all kinds
of crazy ideas.

10:34.970 --> 10:36.500
He wants to start
a corporation.

10:36.500 --> 10:38.000
Can you believe that?
A corporation.

10:38.000 --> 10:40.010
And he wants me
to be the accountant.

10:40.010 --> 10:42.010
Wants me to wear
a green eyeshade.

10:42.010 --> 10:44.430
Now, you know how lousy
I look in hats.

10:44.430 --> 10:46.010
Hey, let me tell
you something,
that's nothing.

10:46.010 --> 10:47.930
I have to have lunch with
him every single day,

10:47.930 --> 10:50.150
and I have to have the
businessman's special.

10:50.150 --> 10:51.730
That's nothing--
he's sending Joanie

10:51.730 --> 10:53.740
to welding school.

10:53.740 --> 10:56.110
Hey, Red,
that is nothing.

10:56.110 --> 10:57.110
Do you know
that he meets girls

10:57.110 --> 10:58.690
at the bottom
of my stairway,

10:58.690 --> 10:59.690
and I have to--
and he sends them home

10:59.690 --> 11:01.530
I don't even get a chance
to look at 'em?

11:01.530 --> 11:02.610
Now, that's something.

11:02.610 --> 11:04.530
You're telling me,
that is something.

11:04.530 --> 11:06.120
(phone rings)

11:06.120 --> 11:08.750
I am busy!

11:08.750 --> 11:10.340
All right.

11:11.840 --> 11:13.840
Now, now get this, Fonz,
because this is serious.

11:13.840 --> 11:15.340
Yeah.

11:15.340 --> 11:17.340
He wants to set up factories
all over the world.
Factories.

11:17.340 --> 11:19.850
He's even got a name
for the corporation.

11:19.850 --> 11:21.300
Yeah, well, I want to
tell you something.

11:21.300 --> 11:22.350
You better do something
about your dad.

11:22.350 --> 11:23.850
Yeah.

11:23.850 --> 11:24.850
He wants to call it

11:24.850 --> 11:26.850
"Fonz-How,
Incorporated."

11:31.940 --> 11:34.030
Yeah.

11:34.030 --> 11:35.530
He wants to go
public with it,

11:35.530 --> 11:38.530
put it on the New York
Stock Exchange
and everything.

11:38.530 --> 11:41.950
Fonz-How, Inc.?

11:41.950 --> 11:43.540
Well, yeah.

11:43.540 --> 11:46.040
Yeah, well, you see, it's
Arthur Fonzarelli

11:46.040 --> 11:47.960
and Howard Cunningham.

11:47.960 --> 11:50.540
Oh, yeah, I got that in very,
very large lights.

11:50.540 --> 11:53.550
Fonz-How, Inc.

11:53.550 --> 11:56.050
I don't know what we're
gonna do about him.

11:56.550 --> 11:57.550
I do.
Good.

11:57.550 --> 11:59.050
You get a blimp.

11:59.050 --> 11:59.970
With very,
very large lights

12:00.550 --> 12:02.050
blinking all
over the world...

12:02.560 --> 12:06.060
Fonz-How, Inc.

12:06.060 --> 12:08.060
A blimp.

12:08.060 --> 12:10.060
Fonz-How...

12:10.060 --> 12:11.430
Whoa!

12:11.810 --> 12:13.730
Can we fix it?
Of course we can fix it.

12:13.730 --> 12:15.820
Let me see it.

12:15.820 --> 12:16.900
All right, now, I'll bet you

12:16.900 --> 12:19.410
that it is this arm right here
is too tight, you got--

12:19.410 --> 12:21.490
Let me have that knife, right
here, just for a minute,

12:21.490 --> 12:23.080
just for a minute.
All right, now look,

12:23.080 --> 12:25.580
if we take-- if we take this
lever right here, you see?

12:25.580 --> 12:27.080
Yeah.
All right,

12:27.080 --> 12:29.080
and we just tighten it.
Just...

12:29.080 --> 12:30.870
one couple...
right, just--

12:30.870 --> 12:32.450
All right,
I'll bet you now

12:32.450 --> 12:34.450
all we have to do is, uh--
There you go.

12:34.450 --> 12:37.340
You-you bent my knife.

12:37.340 --> 12:38.920
Oh, it's going to be
a very famous knife, Al.

12:38.920 --> 12:41.590
We'll just take this right
into the kitchen, right?

12:41.590 --> 12:44.380
My kitchen? You're going to take
that thing into my nice kitchen?

12:44.380 --> 12:45.970
Al, I don't think
you understand.

12:45.970 --> 12:48.470
This is a very important day
at Arnold's, you understand?

12:48.470 --> 12:49.600
Makes history here.

12:49.600 --> 12:51.600
This could be the start
of everything.

12:51.600 --> 12:53.520
You mean,
this could really be big?

12:53.520 --> 12:55.110
Sure, bigger than
hamburgers, Al.

12:55.110 --> 12:57.110
We're talking about
factories, franchises,

12:57.110 --> 12:58.610
New York
Stock Exchange.

12:58.610 --> 12:59.860
Blimps!

13:02.060 --> 13:04.450
What blimps?
We'll talk later.

13:04.450 --> 13:05.570
Could I ride in the blimp?

13:05.570 --> 13:07.150
Yeah, you can ride
in the blimp.

13:07.150 --> 13:08.150
Let me take this.

13:08.150 --> 13:11.660
Clarence, I'm going
to ride in a blimp!

13:11.660 --> 13:12.830
Come on, partner.

13:12.830 --> 13:14.880
RICHIE:
Okay, all right,
I got a solution.

13:14.880 --> 13:15.960
Now, obviously,
we're never going

13:15.960 --> 13:17.460
to be able to play
this song right.

13:17.460 --> 13:20.470
Yeah.
So, we got to gloss
over it with movement.

13:20.470 --> 13:22.050
Yeah? Well, I was made
for movement.

13:22.050 --> 13:24.050
Bo Diddly!

13:24.050 --> 13:25.840
(band playing bluesy melody)

13:39.100 --> 13:41.190
HOWARD:
All right,
put the garbage in, Fonz.

13:41.190 --> 13:42.690
FONZIE:
Hey, you got it, partner.

13:42.690 --> 13:44.690
AL:
That's my cucumber salad!

13:44.690 --> 13:46.690
HOWARD:
Okay, let it go, Fonz.

13:46.690 --> 13:48.490
(explosive rumbling)

13:54.030 --> 13:57.700
We must really be off.

13:57.700 --> 13:58.790
Yeah.

13:58.790 --> 14:01.960
That's the first time
people threw food at us.

14:01.960 --> 14:04.040
(melody resumes)

14:15.390 --> 14:18.390
Okay, so it's got
a few kinks in it.

14:18.390 --> 14:20.890
We'll work it out.

14:28.400 --> 14:30.700
HOWARD:
<i><font size="24"><font face="Arial">We did it{\r}!</font></font></i>

14:30.700 --> 14:32.290
We did it!

14:32.290 --> 14:35.240
Marion, Richie, Joanie,
come on down here!

14:35.240 --> 14:36.290
HOWARD (laughing):
It works! It works!

14:36.290 --> 14:37.410
We did it.
MARION:
Howard.

14:37.410 --> 14:38.490
Howard,
why the yelling?
It works.

14:38.490 --> 14:39.460
It's 3:00
in the morning.

14:39.460 --> 14:41.000
Come on, come
on, it works!
Really?

14:41.000 --> 14:42.500
Oh, this is exciting.

14:42.500 --> 14:43.500
Oh, now, this is fun.
Congratulations.

14:44.000 --> 14:45.500
Oh, that's
great, Dad.
That's great, Dad.

14:45.500 --> 14:47.250
Start it up.
Start it up.

14:47.250 --> 14:48.840
Well, all right, I'll
just, uh, press the button.

14:48.840 --> 14:51.220
Wait!
Are you going
to hug me again?

14:53.340 --> 14:55.930
You just can't
turn on a switch like this.

14:55.930 --> 14:59.150
Don't you realize that
this is an historical moment?

14:59.150 --> 15:01.070
I mean, the minute
that switch goes on,

15:01.070 --> 15:03.150
the world is never going
to be the same again.

15:03.150 --> 15:05.070
We're going to have
whatever we want.

15:05.070 --> 15:07.160
Can I drop out of
welding school, Dad?

15:07.160 --> 15:09.020
We'll see.

15:09.020 --> 15:10.110
Fonzie...

15:10.110 --> 15:11.490
Whoa.

15:11.490 --> 15:13.030
It's your honor.

15:18.450 --> 15:21.950
In the name of
Fonz-How, Inc.

15:23.170 --> 15:25.170
(machine hums)

15:26.710 --> 15:30.300
(machine clatters and stops)

15:30.300 --> 15:31.710
That was exciting.

15:34.050 --> 15:36.050
Doesn't work.

15:36.050 --> 15:37.550
It doesn't work!

15:38.050 --> 15:39.720
What happened?
It doesn't work!

15:39.720 --> 15:41.310
Oh, no!
That's all right,
all right.

15:41.310 --> 15:42.810
Mr. C, please!
Oh, Dad.

15:42.810 --> 15:45.310
Oh, gosh,
everyone go to bed.

15:45.310 --> 15:47.650
Oh, Howard, now it's going
to be all right.

15:47.650 --> 15:48.730
Come to bed, and you'll see.

15:49.230 --> 15:50.730
It'll be... It'll be all right
tomorrow, dear.

15:51.230 --> 15:53.740
Well, why don't you fix it
like you always do?

15:53.740 --> 15:55.240
Give it the old
Fonzie bang.

15:55.240 --> 15:56.320
That's an idea.

15:56.320 --> 15:57.870
Wait a minute. It's not an idea.

15:57.870 --> 15:59.910
See, this is not a simple toy.

15:59.910 --> 16:00.910
This is heavy machinery.

16:00.910 --> 16:02.580
We're talking
about hydraulics here.

16:02.580 --> 16:03.660
Oh, Fonzie's right.
It's useless.

16:03.660 --> 16:05.160
Go to bed, everyone.

16:05.160 --> 16:07.170
Oh, Howard, why don't you just
give it one...

16:07.170 --> 16:08.500
Marion, please!

16:08.500 --> 16:10.590
Yes, dear, we'll all
go to bed.

16:10.590 --> 16:13.090
Well, it was good
while it worked, Dad.

16:13.090 --> 16:15.090
Hey, uh, yeah, don't worry,
Dad, because, uh,

16:15.090 --> 16:17.090
first time out,

16:17.090 --> 16:19.510
Alexander Graham Bell
got a wrong number.

16:25.570 --> 16:27.650
Hey, Mr. C., don't
worry about it.

16:27.650 --> 16:29.820
We can have it
fixed in a jiffy.

16:29.820 --> 16:33.110
No, Fonzie, I am through.

16:33.110 --> 16:34.690
Finished.

16:34.690 --> 16:36.200
This Garbage Gulper
was a crazy idea.

16:36.200 --> 16:37.700
I quit.
Now, wait a minute.

16:37.700 --> 16:39.700
Wait a minute.
That is not right.

16:39.700 --> 16:41.200
This Garbage Gulper
was a great idea,

16:41.200 --> 16:43.200
and you can't just
quit like that.

16:43.200 --> 16:44.540
I just did.

16:44.540 --> 16:45.620
Well, what about

16:45.620 --> 16:48.120
if all the great men
in history quit, right?

16:48.120 --> 16:49.630
What about Edison
and the light bulb?

16:49.630 --> 16:52.460
Then I'd be quitting
in the dark.

16:52.460 --> 16:54.880
And what about Macaroni
and the radio?

16:54.880 --> 16:56.470
Marconi.
Whatever.

16:58.470 --> 17:00.770
Fonzie, I give up!

17:00.770 --> 17:02.860
All right. All right,
you can just sit there.

17:02.860 --> 17:05.359
If you want to let
the American housewife down,

17:05.359 --> 17:06.940
that's up to you.

17:06.940 --> 17:10.359
But this is one man
that would never let women down.

17:23.910 --> 17:27.910
Now, would you be so kind as
to hand me a screwdriver?

17:31.970 --> 17:34.970
Yeah, maybe if we just
adjust this lever, huh?

17:34.970 --> 17:36.970
All right, maybe
it's too tight.

17:36.970 --> 17:37.970
That's it.

17:37.970 --> 17:39.980
We're going to have
this fixed, Mr. C.,

17:39.980 --> 17:41.980
and then we can
show them, you know?

17:41.980 --> 17:44.930
Well, you just don't show it,
Fonzie, you got to sell it.

17:44.930 --> 17:46.480
You got to make a presentation.

17:46.480 --> 17:48.980
You know, I remember
when they sold the rake,

17:48.980 --> 17:50.490
they had a 20-minute film.

17:50.490 --> 17:51.740
Oh, it was so boring.

17:51.740 --> 17:53.770
We're gon... We're
gonna make a film?

17:53.770 --> 17:56.240
Maybe we can
use the blimp.

17:56.240 --> 17:58.830
We won't have time
for that,

17:58.830 --> 18:00.330
but we'll give them
a presentation

18:00.330 --> 18:02.160
they'll never forget.

18:07.920 --> 18:11.920
Gentlemen, this is
a Garbage Gulper.

18:11.920 --> 18:13.790
A catchy name, huh? Huh?

18:13.790 --> 18:14.880
Richard?

18:16.380 --> 18:19.380
Now, what this does is
take a week's garbage

18:19.380 --> 18:23.470
and compact it into one
small, tiny package.

18:23.470 --> 18:24.550
You're very dynamic,
Howard.

18:24.550 --> 18:25.470
Thank you.

18:27.690 --> 18:29.780
So what we have here is garbage,

18:29.780 --> 18:33.780
and the great need
for the How-Fonz Garbage Gulper.

18:34.280 --> 18:35.280
Oh, hey,
hey, hey.

18:35.280 --> 18:39.790
Oh, excuse me.
The Fonz-How Garbage Gulper.

18:39.790 --> 18:41.950
And now, I would like
to introduce you

18:41.950 --> 18:44.540
to the gentleman
who's in charge of
our marketing survey.

18:45.040 --> 18:47.040
And accounting.

18:47.040 --> 18:50.660
As you know, a housewife
has many responsibilities--

18:50.660 --> 18:53.830
raising the children,
shopping for food

18:53.830 --> 18:56.920
and taking care of her
family's many needs.

18:56.920 --> 18:57.920
Now I'd like
to introduce

18:57.920 --> 18:59.920
to you a typical
American housewife

18:59.920 --> 19:03.340
who will give you her
unbiased opinion of garbage.

19:03.340 --> 19:08.230
(Richie, Potsie and Ralph hum
"Stars and Stripes Forever")

19:08.230 --> 19:11.320
My many, numerous,
happy chores

19:11.320 --> 19:13.600
are interrupted
many times a day

19:13.600 --> 19:16.070
by taking out
the garbage.

19:16.070 --> 19:17.570
How many times
have I said

19:17.570 --> 19:21.160
to myself, "Golly, gee,
I wish I had a machine

19:21.160 --> 19:23.830
"that could compress
the garbage,

19:23.830 --> 19:26.920
and then I would just have
to make one trip a week?"

19:26.920 --> 19:28.870
Thank you, typical
American housewife.

19:28.870 --> 19:30.250
You know,

19:30.250 --> 19:33.340
I just realized that garbage
is a plague on this earth.

19:33.340 --> 19:35.840
It's... I just
spend time

19:35.840 --> 19:37.340
constantly taking
out the garbage.

19:37.340 --> 19:39.850
I mean, who would think
that a family of four

19:39.850 --> 19:41.930
could make so
much garbage?

19:41.930 --> 19:43.180
Uh, uh, thank you, Marion.

19:43.180 --> 19:44.270
This is my son.

19:44.270 --> 19:46.270
I have a
daughter, also.

19:46.270 --> 19:47.770
Well, I'm sorry your daughter
couldn't make it.

19:48.270 --> 19:49.270
They could use a soprano.

19:49.270 --> 19:51.560
She went to the movies
with Jenny Piccolo.

19:51.560 --> 19:54.530
Marion, can we get on... Boys!

19:54.530 --> 19:55.480
(one final hum)

20:01.480 --> 20:05.950
And now, Mr. Fonzarelli
will demonstrate the machine.

20:05.950 --> 20:08.990
All right. Potsie, let's-let's
put the garbage right in here.

20:08.990 --> 20:11.990
Right, uh, garbage in, Fonz.

20:11.990 --> 20:14.000
All right.

20:14.000 --> 20:16.500
I've just got
to turn this on.

20:16.500 --> 20:18.670
(whirring)

20:18.670 --> 20:20.250
Oh. Oh, my, my.

20:20.250 --> 20:21.750
That-That really seems
to be working.

20:21.750 --> 20:23.260
Oh, my, this is fun.

20:23.260 --> 20:24.810
Oh, give me all the garbage.

20:24.810 --> 20:25.890
Oh.
Especially
the liverwurst.

20:25.890 --> 20:26.890
Get the liverwurst in here.

20:26.890 --> 20:28.890
Oh, wow, look at all the garbage
going in there.

20:28.890 --> 20:30.400
Here we go.

20:30.400 --> 20:32.900
Oh, more trash,
come on, more trash.

20:32.900 --> 20:35.180
That's it.
Right in here.

20:35.180 --> 20:36.770
(clanks)

20:36.770 --> 20:37.770
(machine stops)
What happened?

20:37.770 --> 20:40.070
Uh, no sweat, no
sweat. Just overload.

20:40.070 --> 20:42.570
Just overload. Hey, any
of you guys in here got a broom?

20:42.570 --> 20:44.160
Uh, your walking
stick will do.

20:44.160 --> 20:46.160
No, no, no, that's
a very expensive walking stick.

20:46.160 --> 20:47.610
Leave that alone.

20:47.610 --> 20:49.830
Well, so is the Garbage Gulper.

20:49.830 --> 20:51.780
That is a solid silver tip.

20:51.780 --> 20:52.870
It's a beautiful
thing.

20:52.870 --> 20:54.370
Yeah, really.

20:54.370 --> 20:56.120
All right, here we go,
here we go.

20:57.840 --> 20:59.340
(crunching)
Oh, hold it,
hold it.

20:59.340 --> 21:00.930
Hold it. Big fella!
Hold it, big fella!

21:00.930 --> 21:02.430
(whirring)
This is... Hey,
Hold it! Hold it!

21:02.430 --> 21:04.510
Big fella,
wait a minute, hold it.

21:04.510 --> 21:05.850
Whoa!

21:05.850 --> 21:06.930
Whoa!

21:06.930 --> 21:08.430
Hey.
(machine whirring)

21:08.430 --> 21:09.940
Easy, easy does it.

21:09.940 --> 21:12.890
Well, at least I saved you
the most expensive part.

21:15.360 --> 21:17.980
What am I supposed
to do with that?

21:17.980 --> 21:19.950
Are you kidding?
It still works. I...

21:19.950 --> 21:22.530
I just suggest that you walk
very close to tables,

21:22.530 --> 21:24.030
that's all.

21:24.030 --> 21:26.030
Will you take that
out of here, all of you?

21:26.030 --> 21:27.540
I don't want to
see this knock-off.

Oh, Howard,

21:41.630 --> 21:43.640
they didn't
like it.

21:43.640 --> 21:46.140
No, they said
that America wasn't ready yet

21:46.140 --> 21:49.310
for the Garbage
Gulper.

21:49.310 --> 21:51.390
However...

21:51.390 --> 21:53.260
they did like
our hydraulic system.

21:54.900 --> 21:55.980
Yeah, as a
matter of fact,

21:55.980 --> 21:59.690
they paid us $300 for
our hydraulic system.

21:59.690 --> 22:00.940
(all talking at once)

22:00.940 --> 22:02.270
$300?

22:02.270 --> 22:03.360
Yeah, dig
this, dig this.

22:03.360 --> 22:05.360
We got our names
on a patent pending.

22:05.360 --> 22:07.410
That's pretty good, huh?

22:07.410 --> 22:08.910
(all talking
at once)
That's great!

22:08.910 --> 22:10.000
That's great.
That's great.

22:10.000 --> 22:11.500
I'm so
proud of you.

22:12.000 --> 22:13.000
Thank you,
sweetheart.

22:13.000 --> 22:15.950
You're-You're a man
ahead of your time, Dad.

22:15.950 --> 22:18.540
Yeah, well, I couldn't have
done it without you, Fonzie.

22:18.540 --> 22:20.040
I don't know how
to thank you.

22:20.040 --> 22:22.040
Well, you know, you
can give me the $300.

22:22.040 --> 22:25.210
Oh, I don't want
to do that.

22:25.210 --> 22:26.290
But I'll give you
a little hug.

22:26.290 --> 22:28.800
Yeah. Once.
Hmm?

22:28.800 --> 22:30.300
Okay, that's enough.

22:30.300 --> 22:31.300
Yeah, that's enough.

22:31.800 --> 22:32.850
Partner, huh?

22:32.850 --> 22:33.940
All right,
partner.

22:33.940 --> 22:35.440
Congratulations.

22:35.440 --> 22:36.810
All right,
look at this.

22:36.810 --> 22:37.890
My best friend and my dad.

22:37.890 --> 22:40.440
I want to just
give you something as a memento

22:40.440 --> 22:41.530
of this moment.

22:41.530 --> 22:43.030
Oh. Isn't that nice?

22:43.030 --> 22:45.360
Well, how come
you're giving me my own camera?

22:45.360 --> 22:46.950
Oh, no. No.

22:46.950 --> 22:49.870
I'm going to take a picture
of Fonzie and you.

22:49.870 --> 22:51.950
Oh.

22:53.960 --> 22:55.460
And your dream blimp.

23:00.460 --> 23:01.960
That's terrific, huh?

23:01.960 --> 23:03.470
Hey, let me ask
you a question.

23:03.470 --> 23:05.000
Does this blink?

23:05.000 --> 23:06.250
No, no, it's just a blimp.

23:06.250 --> 23:08.840
Oh.
Well, my partner and I
will fix that right away.

23:08.840 --> 23:10.390
Yeah.
Okay.

23:10.390 --> 23:11.510
Okay, get ready.

23:11.510 --> 23:13.590
Yeah, I'm-I'm ready.

23:40.950 --> 23:41.920
All right, bye-bye, dear.

23:43.370 --> 23:44.870
I just talked to Joanie,

23:44.870 --> 23:47.210
and she said
she's so happy for you.

23:47.210 --> 23:48.290
Oh, and she said
she wanted to know

23:48.290 --> 23:50.800
if she could quit
welding school.

23:50.800 --> 23:52.300
Well, we'll see.

23:52.800 --> 23:55.130
I guess maybe I got
carried away too much, huh?

23:55.130 --> 23:56.720
Oh, Arthur.

23:56.720 --> 23:58.720
I'm just so sorry
that you and Howard

23:58.720 --> 24:00.560
didn't become rich and famous.

24:00.560 --> 24:02.310
You know, Fonzie,

24:02.310 --> 24:04.280
you're amazing;
you never get depressed.

24:04.280 --> 24:06.360
Oh, that's only on the outside,

24:06.360 --> 24:09.360
but deep, deep, deep,
way deep down, I get depressed.

24:09.360 --> 24:14.570
But I got my own way
of, uh, drowning my sorrows.

24:14.570 --> 24:16.660
Excuse me.

24:17.660 --> 24:19.660
