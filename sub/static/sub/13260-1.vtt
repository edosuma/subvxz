WEBVTT

00:00.740 --> 00:03.907
(gentle bouncy music)

00:47.575 --> 00:50.623
- Okay, we'll do the plant
watering pointer first,

00:51.560 --> 00:54.570
are you almost ready
with the set up Nigel?

00:54.570 --> 00:55.557
- Seconds away.

00:55.557 --> 00:57.520
- And then we'll do the
bit about using mayonnaise

00:57.520 --> 01:00.790
as hair conditioner, and
we'll finish with the pointer

01:00.790 --> 01:02.440
on how to clean the cat.

01:02.440 --> 01:05.760
- About shampooing cats,
I tried it in the lab,

01:05.760 --> 01:06.860
it's not a good idea.

01:06.860 --> 01:07.803
- Ooh, clearly.

01:10.510 --> 01:12.868
- Kitty tray, powder, no cat, no cat.

01:12.868 --> 01:14.085
- Okay, how do I look?

01:14.085 --> 01:15.430
- Wunderbar.

01:15.430 --> 01:17.552
- Alright chaps, we'll try one.

01:17.552 --> 01:19.010
(bell ringing)

01:19.010 --> 01:20.433
- [Director] Okay here we go.

01:23.010 --> 01:26.800
- And now it's time for our
first Pru Pointer of the week,

01:26.800 --> 01:28.860
this question comes from
one of our big fans,

01:28.860 --> 01:30.960
Henrietta from Houston.

01:30.960 --> 01:33.250
Hey sweetie, tell Earl
that the crew just love

01:33.250 --> 01:34.550
the latest batch of chili.

01:35.440 --> 01:39.110
Henrietta writes, dear
Prudence, Earl and I are going

01:39.110 --> 01:41.710
bass fishing, the cats
can fend for themselves,

01:41.710 --> 01:43.290
but I don't know how my poor plants

01:43.290 --> 01:45.173
are going to get watered, help.

01:46.010 --> 01:48.463
Houston, we have a solution.

01:50.630 --> 01:54.710
Fill a bucket with water.
(water splashing)

01:54.710 --> 01:57.630
tie some cotton twine around a brick,

01:57.630 --> 01:59.253
put the brick in the water.

02:00.620 --> 02:03.970
Take the end of the twine
and put it in the soil

02:03.970 --> 02:04.940
of the plants.

02:04.940 --> 02:07.580
Now the cotton sucks up
the water like a straw

02:07.580 --> 02:09.940
and provides a steady supply of water

02:09.940 --> 02:10.889
to the (yawns) cut.

02:13.438 --> 02:15.912
(bell ringing)
- Cut.

02:15.912 --> 02:17.310
- Speaking of sucking is this segment,

02:17.310 --> 02:18.390
like totally tanking.

02:18.390 --> 02:20.110
- No, not at all I --

02:20.110 --> 02:22.350
- I agree, I think the
pointers fascinating.

02:22.350 --> 02:24.760
- Oh yeah, I get it, the
pointers fine, but I'm tanking.

02:24.760 --> 02:25.960
- That's not what I'm saying.

02:25.960 --> 02:28.570
- Oh no there's no
tankage, not at all, zero.

02:28.570 --> 02:30.200
- That's what you're thinking.

02:30.200 --> 02:32.570
And you know you're right,
I've just been off my game

02:32.570 --> 02:34.220
for a while.

02:34.220 --> 02:36.920
I'm just feeling a bit,
I don't know, a bit --

02:36.920 --> 02:38.650
- Distracted.
- Disconnected.

02:38.650 --> 02:39.513
- Exhausted.

02:40.520 --> 02:41.720
- It's that obvious.

02:41.720 --> 02:44.300
- You work too hard, your
mother was the same way

02:44.300 --> 02:46.470
when she wrote the Pru Pointers column.

02:46.470 --> 02:47.661
She lived to work.

02:47.661 --> 02:50.430
- (scoffs) My mother
worked to avoid living.

02:50.430 --> 02:51.700
- If the shoe fits sweetie.

02:51.700 --> 02:53.670
- I am not my mother Jeffrey.

02:53.670 --> 02:55.423
- You're getting there, it's why I'm going

02:55.423 --> 02:56.823
to have to fire you.

02:57.740 --> 02:58.730
- Fire me.

02:58.730 --> 03:00.210
- You're the cornerstone
of my empire Prudence,

03:00.210 --> 03:03.070
my cash cow, I can't afford
to have you burn out.

03:03.070 --> 03:05.223
Finish the segment and you're gone,

03:06.390 --> 03:07.790
for a week.

03:07.790 --> 03:09.280
- [Pru] Are you off your meds again?

03:09.280 --> 03:11.190
- You leave tomorrow,
take the company plane.

03:11.190 --> 03:12.023
- To where?

03:12.023 --> 03:13.233
- To my lodge in Wyoming.

03:14.430 --> 03:17.140
- I'm a New Yorker, what
am I gonna do in Wyoming,

03:17.140 --> 03:18.630
stare at the bloody mountains?

03:18.630 --> 03:21.790
- Why not, stare at the
mountains, sleep, read,

03:21.790 --> 03:23.173
start painting again.

03:24.194 --> 03:27.527
(plane engine rumbling)

03:29.561 --> 03:33.561
(muffled airport announcements)

03:41.617 --> 03:43.772
(people chattering)

03:43.772 --> 03:46.640
- Hello, I'm Prudence
McCoy, and you must be Ruth.

03:46.640 --> 03:48.900
- Yes I am, nice to meet you Miss. McCoy.

03:48.900 --> 03:50.870
- Oh no, please call me Prudence.

03:50.870 --> 03:52.522
- So, how was your flight?

03:52.522 --> 03:56.550
- Torture, four hours in that
plane felt like four days

03:56.550 --> 03:58.443
and I wanted to sleep
but I couldn't of course,

03:58.443 --> 04:00.710
I had no appetite, well
I never do when I fly,

04:00.710 --> 04:02.410
and I had seen the movie the night before.

04:02.410 --> 04:04.500
Coming down to land the
plane was shaking so badly

04:04.500 --> 04:07.130
I thought it was gonna
come apart at the seams.

04:07.130 --> 04:09.282
It's why I loathe vacations,
they're nerve wracking.

04:09.282 --> 04:10.780
(buzzer sounds)

04:10.780 --> 04:14.703
Bags already, in New York I
have to wait a week for these.

04:17.420 --> 04:19.910
- Were there other
passengers on the plane?

04:19.910 --> 04:21.320
- No, no, I was alone.

04:21.320 --> 04:22.940
- I know this is a
ridiculous amount of luggage,

04:22.940 --> 04:24.120
but I'm a terrible traveler,

04:24.120 --> 04:25.760
I always have to pack
everything so I can decide

04:25.760 --> 04:26.990
what not to wear.

04:26.990 --> 04:31.283
Hold on, those squeaky
wheels are driving me nuts.

04:31.283 --> 04:34.616
(gentle tinkling music)

04:36.189 --> 04:37.610
- What is that?

04:37.610 --> 04:40.920
- Olive oil, extra virgin,
good for rusty metal

04:40.920 --> 04:43.560
and sticky locks, low acidity,

04:43.560 --> 04:45.950
delicious on salads and vegetables.

04:45.950 --> 04:47.033
Now try it again.

04:49.860 --> 04:51.293
Pru Pointer number 86,

04:52.284 --> 04:54.134
I got it from an old Italian plumber.

04:56.477 --> 04:59.727
(gentle, bright music)

05:05.095 --> 05:07.900
The sky is just so amazing.

05:07.900 --> 05:10.140
Living in New York it's
easy to forget there is one.

05:10.140 --> 05:12.540
- Well you should take advantage
of it while you're here,

05:12.540 --> 05:14.900
especially the sunrise and sunset.

05:14.900 --> 05:16.240
I know a beautiful place to view that.

05:16.240 --> 05:18.170
- Would you take me out there sometime?

05:18.170 --> 05:20.240
- Well I'm meeting some
people out there later,

05:20.240 --> 05:23.040
I could rearrange it, then
we could stop on the way.

05:23.040 --> 05:25.801
- That seems like the
perfect antidote to jet lag.

05:25.801 --> 05:28.551
(birds chirping)

06:01.176 --> 06:03.370
- Tassajaro's been a
sacred ground to my people

06:03.370 --> 06:04.730
since time immemorial.

06:04.730 --> 06:06.910
- It's beautiful land.

06:06.910 --> 06:09.163
- We come here for ceremonies, fasting.

06:10.050 --> 06:12.790
- What's the fabric on the trees?

06:12.790 --> 06:14.273
- Those are prayer ties.

06:15.350 --> 06:18.450
We bundle our prayers in
an offering of tobacco

06:18.450 --> 06:21.043
to be carried to the
creator by the spirits.

06:26.123 --> 06:28.000
- Was Bart Andrews a member of your tribe?

06:28.000 --> 06:30.900
- Oh no, no the Andrews
family has owned Tassajaro

06:30.900 --> 06:33.230
for 140 years.

06:33.230 --> 06:35.190
- Isn't this your peoples land?

06:35.190 --> 06:36.937
- Well yeah that's the way we look at it,

06:36.937 --> 06:39.230
but the government
decided that they owned it

06:39.230 --> 06:42.910
and they sold most of it
off to farmers and ranchers.

06:42.910 --> 06:45.400
But when the Andrews
family bought Tassajaro

06:45.400 --> 06:47.980
they promised it would not be disturbed.

06:47.980 --> 06:51.210
- Hmm, looks like they kept their promise.

06:51.210 --> 06:53.443
- Yes they did, especially Bart.

06:54.430 --> 06:56.890
He was like family to
us, he loved Tassajaro

06:56.890 --> 07:00.570
as much as we do, in fact we're holding

07:00.570 --> 07:02.770
a commemoration of his
death here next week.

07:04.566 --> 07:07.483
(car horn beeping)

07:20.416 --> 07:22.620
Thanks for coming early.

07:22.620 --> 07:24.810
Jean Philippe Andrews, Doug Craig,

07:24.810 --> 07:26.820
this is Prudence McCoy,
she'll be staying at the lodge

07:26.820 --> 07:27.850
for a few days.

07:27.850 --> 07:29.460
- Hi, nice to meet you.

07:29.460 --> 07:31.080
- Jean Philippe is Bart's son,

07:31.080 --> 07:33.610
and Doug's the lawyer
for Andrew's Land Trust

07:33.610 --> 07:35.410
that takes care of Tassajaro,

07:35.410 --> 07:37.610
we're planning Bart's memorial together.

07:37.610 --> 07:39.710
- I've got some ideas about that Ruth,

07:39.710 --> 07:41.520
come and talk with me for a moment.

07:41.520 --> 07:42.570
- Do you mind?
- No.

07:44.214 --> 07:46.660
- Excuse us mademoiselle.

07:46.660 --> 07:47.493
- So if you're staying at the lodge,

07:47.493 --> 07:49.379
you must be the Prudence McCoy.

07:49.379 --> 07:50.890
- The only one I know.

07:50.890 --> 07:53.070
- I met Jeff Simcox when
I handled a zoning matter

07:53.070 --> 07:53.920
out here for him.

07:53.920 --> 07:55.900
You'd just taken over your mothers column,

07:55.900 --> 07:57.428
he said you'd be even better then her.

07:57.428 --> 08:00.680
- Oh, I'm not sure about
that, different I hope.

08:00.680 --> 08:03.280
- Ah, well my father was
a suspenders, cigars,

08:03.280 --> 08:04.570
single malt scotch kind of lawyer,

08:04.570 --> 08:05.787
I always wanted to be different too.

08:05.787 --> 08:07.560
- So you don't wear suspenders?

08:07.560 --> 08:09.100
- Or smoke cigars.

08:09.100 --> 08:12.390
I do however enjoy my scotch,
would you like to have

08:12.390 --> 08:14.250
a drink while your out here.

08:14.250 --> 08:15.190
- I'd love that.

08:15.190 --> 08:16.100
- Good.

08:16.100 --> 08:17.520
- If I can fit it in to my days

08:17.520 --> 08:19.128
of doing absolutely nothing.

08:19.128 --> 08:20.830
(phone ringing)

08:20.830 --> 08:24.220
- Excuse me, I should take this.

08:24.220 --> 08:25.613
Excuse me, hello.

08:29.830 --> 08:32.143
- So, Doug Craig.

08:34.240 --> 08:36.073
- He's a nice man, he grew up here.

08:37.130 --> 08:39.100
My son JR worked for him for a summer,

08:39.100 --> 08:42.440
he's a long time friend of Bart Andrews,

08:42.440 --> 08:45.373
like a son to him really,
very well liked, respected,

08:46.540 --> 08:48.160
divorced.

08:48.160 --> 08:49.390
(both laugh)

08:49.390 --> 08:50.543
- Was I that obvious?

08:52.270 --> 08:53.400
- We shouldn't have stayed so long,

08:53.400 --> 08:54.900
would you like to get something to drink?

08:54.900 --> 08:56.883
- Oh, I'd love that, I'm so thirsty.

08:58.210 --> 08:59.410
- Been coming to this place since the day

08:59.410 --> 09:03.193
I turned 21, met my husband Russell here.

09:05.859 --> 09:07.845
(diners murmuring and chattering)

09:07.845 --> 09:09.453
Hey Gord, Kathy, Eddie.

09:10.600 --> 09:12.010
- Hey Ruth.

09:12.010 --> 09:15.567
- Prudence McCoy, she's
staying at the lodge.

09:15.567 --> 09:16.743
This is Eddie, he's a detective

09:16.743 --> 09:18.393
with the police department.

09:19.530 --> 09:20.730
I'll get us some drinks.

09:27.760 --> 09:28.810
- Welcome to Wyoming.

09:30.690 --> 09:32.200
- You're a Red Sox fan?

09:32.200 --> 09:33.684
- Born in South El Paso.

09:33.684 --> 09:34.540
- I live in New York.

09:34.540 --> 09:35.942
- I won't even ask.

09:35.942 --> 09:37.350
- Hmm, you're a clever man.

09:37.350 --> 09:39.650
- Yeah, for a Red Sox fan.

09:39.650 --> 09:41.940
- What do you shave with
anyway, a chain saw?

09:41.940 --> 09:42.773
- What are you talkin' about?

09:42.773 --> 09:45.310
- You have a serious case of razor burn.

09:45.310 --> 09:46.752
- And?

09:46.752 --> 09:48.440
- Well I hate to see a man in pain.

09:48.440 --> 09:49.640
- Relax, I'm not in pain.

09:49.640 --> 09:52.040
- Oh right, and selling Babe Ruth

09:52.040 --> 09:53.270
wasn't the worst mistake in the history

09:53.270 --> 09:54.330
of professional sports.

09:54.330 --> 09:57.270
- That's history, the curse
of the Bambino is over.

09:57.270 --> 09:58.700
- You wish.

09:58.700 --> 09:59.760
- I don't have to wish, I've got

09:59.760 --> 10:03.750
the World Series 2004, got
the World Series in 2007.

10:03.750 --> 10:06.030
- Have you got some oatmeal at home?

10:06.030 --> 10:07.160
- I hate oatmeal.

10:07.160 --> 10:08.844
- You're not gonna eat it,

10:08.844 --> 10:10.070
you're gonna rub it on your face.

10:10.070 --> 10:11.400
- Rub it on my face?

10:11.400 --> 10:13.600
- That's right, three times a day,

10:13.600 --> 10:15.530
leave it on for about 15 minutes,

10:15.530 --> 10:17.070
razor burn will be gone in the morning.

10:17.070 --> 10:18.180
Oh, and one more thing --

10:18.180 --> 10:21.000
- No, that's okay, you've done enough.

10:21.000 --> 10:23.683
- Pop for a new razor
every three to four years.

10:25.668 --> 10:28.835
(gentle bouncy music)

10:29.740 --> 10:31.860
- I started working at the
lodge when I was in high school,

10:31.860 --> 10:34.140
it's the only real job I had,

10:34.140 --> 10:35.860
and then when my husband passed away

10:35.860 --> 10:37.223
I moved in full time.

10:41.620 --> 10:44.980
- This room makes
Carnegie Hall look small.

10:44.980 --> 10:46.900
- Yeah, we call it the great room,

10:46.900 --> 10:49.080
Mr Simcox designed it himself.

10:49.080 --> 10:53.370
- Oh, of course he did, Jeffrey loves big,

10:53.370 --> 10:54.963
and bigger, and biggest.

10:56.120 --> 10:58.513
- I'll show you your room,
it's right over here.

11:01.090 --> 11:03.360
Mr Simcox wanted you to stay in this room,

11:03.360 --> 11:05.798
he said it would be
perfect for your visit.

11:05.798 --> 11:08.610
- Well he's determined to see me relaxed.

11:08.610 --> 11:11.090
- This lodge is wonderful for that.

11:11.090 --> 11:12.880
- That's my mother.

11:12.880 --> 11:15.340
- Yes this was her favorite
room when she stayed here.

11:15.340 --> 11:16.480
- She stayed here?

11:16.480 --> 11:18.900
- Many times after your father
passed on, you didn't know?

11:18.900 --> 11:21.510
- No, but that's no surprise,

11:21.510 --> 11:22.790
my mother was always a bit of a mystery.

11:22.790 --> 11:24.410
I mean she never talked
to me about herself,

11:24.410 --> 11:27.320
or about anything really.

11:27.320 --> 11:29.170
- Yeah, I always used
to try to talk to my son

11:29.170 --> 11:31.683
but he hated hearing his
mother telling stories.

11:32.880 --> 11:35.663
- I would have loved to have
heard my mothers stories.

11:37.745 --> 11:38.578
(gong chiming)

11:38.578 --> 11:39.580
- Excuse me Prudence.

11:44.000 --> 11:45.893
- Who is this woman Jeffrey?

11:47.270 --> 11:50.530
Well I'm not sure that
she is my mother you twit.

11:50.530 --> 11:52.760
My mother didn't go on vacations.

11:52.760 --> 11:53.910
I mean she hardly ever smiled,

11:53.910 --> 11:55.660
and she definitely never had any fun,

11:55.660 --> 11:57.460
well at least not when I was around.

11:58.930 --> 12:00.870
And how come you never told me

12:00.870 --> 12:02.033
that she came out here.

12:03.390 --> 12:05.190
Well of course it's important to me.

12:07.210 --> 12:08.510
Because she never told me.

12:10.440 --> 12:13.530
Look forget the alien who's
pretending to be my mother,

12:13.530 --> 12:16.690
what do you know about
Douglas Craig Esquire?

12:16.690 --> 12:18.390
I just ran into him today in town.

12:19.785 --> 12:21.533
Well is there anything
I should know about him?

12:22.600 --> 12:24.853
Girlfriend, boyfriend, ax murderer?

12:26.760 --> 12:31.393
I don't know, I might
call him, if I get bored.

12:33.270 --> 12:35.443
Who are you, Yenta the matchmaker.

12:36.770 --> 12:37.743
Goodbye.

12:41.206 --> 12:44.289
(light bouncy music)

12:50.260 --> 12:51.610
Okay, I'm officially bored.

12:53.065 --> 12:55.732
(phone dialing)

12:57.300 --> 13:00.193
Doug, er yeah it's Prudence.

13:01.060 --> 13:03.943
Yes I got the flowers they're gorgeous.

13:06.030 --> 13:09.380
Well I thought that, I
mean if you want too,

13:09.380 --> 13:11.928
I would love to have dinner with you.

13:11.928 --> 13:14.030
- [JR On Phone] Mom, I need to talk to you

13:14.030 --> 13:18.330
as soon as possible, you've
got to stop what's going on

13:18.330 --> 13:20.070
before it's too late.

13:20.070 --> 13:23.040
Just remember, I'm doing this for you mom,

13:23.040 --> 13:25.400
for you, for all of us.

13:25.400 --> 13:26.233
I love you.

13:27.533 --> 13:32.533
(phone beeping)
(phone dialing)

13:35.230 --> 13:38.403
- [Ruth] JR it's mom, I'm
worried about you sweetie.

13:40.300 --> 13:43.243
I want to talk to you, even
if it's just for a minute,

13:44.568 --> 13:47.741
and I want to hear your
voice, just call me back,

13:47.741 --> 13:52.741
please.
(phone beeping)

13:57.801 --> 14:00.398
- Prudence it's none of your business,

14:00.398 --> 14:04.398
stare at the mountains,
read a book, get a life.

14:15.383 --> 14:16.633
Ruth, you okay?

14:19.130 --> 14:23.522
- Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.

14:23.522 --> 14:25.983
- Ruth you're not fine.

14:25.983 --> 14:27.203
- It's my son.

14:28.530 --> 14:31.670
- [JR On Phone] Mom, I'm working
on this magazine article,

14:31.670 --> 14:33.613
and it's turned into an amazing story.

14:34.720 --> 14:37.509
I need to talk to you as soon as possible,

14:37.509 --> 14:40.520
you've got to stop what's
going on before it's too late.

14:40.520 --> 14:43.260
Just remember, I'm doing this for you mom,

14:43.260 --> 14:45.803
for you, for all of us, I love you.

14:49.263 --> 14:51.970
- You know anything about
the article he was writing?

14:51.970 --> 14:54.223
- No he never talked to me about his work.

14:55.540 --> 14:59.563
Moved away to a cabin,
traveled a lot, wouldn't call.

15:00.920 --> 15:02.670
- You could drive out to his cabin,

15:02.670 --> 15:04.290
make sure he's alright.

15:04.290 --> 15:07.200
- No, I can't leave the
lodge and my guests.

15:07.200 --> 15:10.570
- Yes you can, I mean
this is about family.

15:10.570 --> 15:13.120
Besides your guests would
like to see some Wyoming.

15:13.960 --> 15:16.353
And don't worry about the
lodge, we'll just lock the door.

15:18.380 --> 15:19.921
- When he was younger,

15:19.921 --> 15:22.040
I thought I knew what was best for him

15:22.040 --> 15:23.390
we argued about everything.

15:30.850 --> 15:32.500
Could you come in for a moment,

15:32.500 --> 15:34.223
just to help me break the ice?

15:35.832 --> 15:36.665
- Of course.

15:46.303 --> 15:48.215
(knocking on door)

15:48.215 --> 15:49.856
- JR.

15:49.856 --> 15:51.096
(knocking on door)

15:51.096 --> 15:52.096
JR it's mom.

15:54.606 --> 15:55.439
JR.

15:58.300 --> 16:03.300
Chains on the door, cars
here, he must be home.

16:04.420 --> 16:05.420
- Maybe he's asleep.

16:06.440 --> 16:07.690
- Let's try the mud room.

16:18.965 --> 16:20.048
JR, it's mom.

17:32.270 --> 17:33.613
He's not here.

17:41.185 --> 17:42.018
- Would you like to wait?

17:42.018 --> 17:44.990
- No but I think I'll
straighten up his room,

17:44.990 --> 17:48.750
he's got a month of dirty
clothes up there, do you mind?

17:48.750 --> 17:49.750
- No, of course not.

18:37.200 --> 18:39.280
So there I was with this humongous blob

18:39.280 --> 18:41.670
of bubblegum stuck in my
hair and I was convinced

18:41.670 --> 18:43.790
I was going to have to get my head shaved.

18:43.790 --> 18:47.010
But my mother asked Mr Forsythe,
the man who ran her lab

18:47.010 --> 18:49.400
to see if he could find
a way to get the gum out,

18:49.400 --> 18:52.450
and he discovered peanut
butter did the trick.

18:52.450 --> 18:54.183
Smooth, not chunky mercifully.

18:56.741 --> 18:58.810
- You know Jeff Simcox was right.

18:58.810 --> 18:59.643
- About what?

18:59.643 --> 19:00.680
- About everything.

19:00.680 --> 19:03.930
He said you were charming,
you'd make me laugh.

19:03.930 --> 19:05.000
- When did you talk to Jeffrey?

19:05.000 --> 19:06.300
- As soon as I got back to the office.

19:06.300 --> 19:07.190
I hadn't talked to him for years,

19:07.190 --> 19:09.393
but he was kind enough to take my call.

19:09.393 --> 19:11.180
- Well that must have
been after I called him,

19:11.180 --> 19:12.540
and picked his brain about you.

19:12.540 --> 19:15.460
- Ah, and you decided to
have drinks with my anyway.

19:15.460 --> 19:16.717
- I like to live on the wild side.

19:16.717 --> 19:18.760
- Wyoming's a great place to do that.

19:18.760 --> 19:22.300
- This is incredible, I have
seen you twice in one day,

19:22.300 --> 19:24.460
I've become a very lucky man,

19:24.460 --> 19:26.300
but not as lucky as you mon ami.

19:26.300 --> 19:27.430
- Not even close.

19:27.430 --> 19:29.760
- My fiancee loves your
program mademoiselle.

19:29.760 --> 19:30.790
She threatened to call of the wedding

19:30.790 --> 19:33.520
if I didn't somehow get your autograph.

19:33.520 --> 19:35.540
I know it's tres gauche, but could you?

19:35.540 --> 19:36.643
- Of course.

19:41.580 --> 19:44.690
- You've made me a hero,
at least for tonight.

19:44.690 --> 19:45.523
Merci beaucoup.

19:51.370 --> 19:55.334
- When exactly did men stop
kissing women's hands, and why?

19:55.334 --> 19:57.620
I mean it's so perfectly civilized.

19:57.620 --> 19:59.440
- Well Jean Philippe is from France,

19:59.440 --> 20:01.860
he likes to be tres cosmopolitan,

20:01.860 --> 20:03.490
especially with beautiful women.

20:03.490 --> 20:05.200
- Bart's son was born in France?

20:05.200 --> 20:08.030
- Oh yes, see Jean
Philippe's mother, Jean Vieve

20:08.030 --> 20:09.950
was Bart's French mistress.

20:09.950 --> 20:12.390
When he broke off the affair,
rather badly I'm afraid,

20:12.390 --> 20:14.430
she didn't tell him she was pregnant.

20:14.430 --> 20:16.140
And even when Bart found out he had a son,

20:16.140 --> 20:17.390
she wouldn't let him see him.

20:17.390 --> 20:19.400
- That must have been very hard for him.

20:19.400 --> 20:21.450
- Yeah, Jean Philippe was his only child,

20:21.450 --> 20:24.700
it broke his heart, but
six months before Bart died

20:24.700 --> 20:26.980
of lung cancer, Jean Vieve
died in a car accident

20:26.980 --> 20:29.600
and he sent me over to
France to bring his boy home,

20:29.600 --> 20:31.810
and that, that meant everything to Bart.

20:31.810 --> 20:33.810
To have his son beside him when he died.

20:35.200 --> 20:39.250
- Speaking of sons, you
know Ruth's son don't you?

20:39.250 --> 20:41.140
- JR yeah, I've known him for years.

20:41.140 --> 20:42.320
- Nice kid?

20:42.320 --> 20:44.263
- Yeah, JR's got a good heart.

20:45.160 --> 20:47.600
He's made some stupid
choices that have landed him

20:47.600 --> 20:50.840
in hot water more then once,
but we kept his record clean.

20:50.840 --> 20:52.130
Why do you ask?

20:52.130 --> 20:53.730
- He's just dropped out of sight,

20:53.730 --> 20:56.050
he's not returning his mothers calls.

20:56.050 --> 20:57.520
- No idea where he is?

20:57.520 --> 20:58.353
- None.

20:59.810 --> 21:01.470
Is there anything you know that she should

21:01.470 --> 21:02.703
be concerned about?

21:03.750 --> 21:05.410
- I haven't spoken to JR in months,

21:05.410 --> 21:07.260
I was hoping he'd cleaned up his act.

21:08.140 --> 21:11.303
- That hot water you
mentioned, how hot was it?

21:16.270 --> 21:17.103
- Very.

21:19.093 --> 21:22.426
(gentle tinkling music)

21:49.646 --> 21:52.270
- Oh good this is the police station.

21:52.270 --> 21:53.230
- Ma'am.

21:53.230 --> 21:56.310
- In New York most police
stations look like bomb shelters.

21:56.310 --> 21:57.370
This building looked so quaint

21:57.370 --> 21:59.220
I thought it might be another
boutique or something.

21:59.220 --> 22:01.230
- How can I help you ma'am?

22:01.230 --> 22:04.580
- Sorry, right, I know it's late

22:05.690 --> 22:08.430
but I'm worried about the
son of a friend of mine.

22:08.430 --> 22:11.350
Well actually we just met today,

22:11.350 --> 22:14.000
but I feel connected on
a woman to woman level,

22:14.000 --> 22:15.200
if you know what I mean.

22:16.280 --> 22:19.280
Probably not, which is
probably a good thing.

22:19.280 --> 22:22.520
But what's important is that
she can't locate the boy.

22:22.520 --> 22:24.651
- Well if it's her son,
why isn't she here,

22:24.651 --> 22:25.484
instead of you?

22:25.484 --> 22:26.590
- Oh, she doesn't know that I came.

22:26.590 --> 22:28.650
- But a relative or a spouse has to file

22:28.650 --> 22:30.100
a missing person report.

22:30.100 --> 22:32.170
- Well here's the rub, we don't know

22:32.170 --> 22:33.370
if he really is missing.

22:34.600 --> 22:36.380
- Then why are you here?

22:36.380 --> 22:37.710
- Because he might be missing.

22:37.710 --> 22:42.480
- Ma'am I can't file a might
be missing person report.

22:42.480 --> 22:43.750
- Isn't there someone else here

22:43.750 --> 22:45.340
that I could talk too about this?

22:45.340 --> 22:46.580
- The only officer on duty is --

22:46.580 --> 22:48.560
- Saying sayonara.

22:48.560 --> 22:51.230
- It's you, you can't leave.

22:51.230 --> 22:52.164
- Watch me.

22:52.164 --> 22:53.913
- I, I need to talk to you.

22:54.860 --> 22:56.293
It's about Ruth's son JR,

22:57.550 --> 23:01.695
I don't know but I think he
might have been murdered.

23:01.695 --> 23:03.528
- Murdered?
- Murdered?

23:05.280 --> 23:06.197
- Murdered.

23:10.304 --> 23:12.730
At first I thought it was
a wine stain on the rug

23:12.730 --> 23:15.310
so I pulled out a can of shaving cream.

23:15.310 --> 23:16.740
- Shaving cream?

23:16.740 --> 23:19.490
- It's great for getting
stains out, magic.

23:19.490 --> 23:21.923
Sort of like oatmeal for razor burn.

23:22.770 --> 23:25.190
Anyway, when I was down there on the floor

23:25.190 --> 23:28.410
I noticed this on the table leg.

23:28.410 --> 23:29.930
- And this is?

23:29.930 --> 23:31.180
- Blood.

23:31.180 --> 23:32.050
- Alleged blood.

23:32.050 --> 23:33.093
- Oh it's blood.

23:34.150 --> 23:37.100
Which tells me that the stain
on the rug was blood as well.

23:41.710 --> 23:44.160
- I'll probably regret
this but okay I'll bite,

23:44.160 --> 23:45.740
who's blood do you think this is?

23:45.740 --> 23:48.118
- JR's, he's the only
one who lives there so.

23:48.118 --> 23:49.950
- Maybe he cut himself shaving.

23:49.950 --> 23:53.380
- No, somebody bashed him on
the head with a candlestick.

23:53.380 --> 23:54.550
- A candlestick.

23:54.550 --> 23:56.880
- I saw it at the house, it was wooden,

23:56.880 --> 24:00.186
heavy, sharp edges, I mean
it could do as much damage

24:00.186 --> 24:03.480
as falling off a motorcycle.

24:03.480 --> 24:05.540
You don't really ride those do you?

24:05.540 --> 24:06.373
- I really do.

24:07.230 --> 24:09.050
- You don't have children I hope.

24:09.050 --> 24:11.150
- Look, can we stay focused here.

24:11.150 --> 24:13.820
Who would this someone be?

24:13.820 --> 24:17.540
- The same person that rubbed shoe polish

24:17.540 --> 24:18.760
on the candlestick.

24:18.760 --> 24:21.770
When the candlestick hit JR's head,

24:21.770 --> 24:23.610
the impact made gouges in the candlestick.

24:23.610 --> 24:27.263
Someone used shoe polish
to conceal the gouges.

24:28.490 --> 24:31.060
- Why not just take the candlestick?

24:31.060 --> 24:32.790
- Because if someone
noticed it was missing,

24:32.790 --> 24:34.786
they might start asking why.

24:34.786 --> 24:35.900
Better to leave it in plain sight,

24:35.900 --> 24:37.820
so it looks like nothing ever happened.

24:37.820 --> 24:40.283
That's why the kitchen was neat as a pin.

24:41.200 --> 24:45.180
- The kitchen was neat,
and this is important?

24:45.180 --> 24:47.655
- The murderer didn't want it to look like

24:47.655 --> 24:48.650
someone had been killed there.

24:48.650 --> 24:52.250
- So the alleged murderer
cleared the table,

24:52.250 --> 24:55.280
and washed the dishes, after he allegedly

24:55.280 --> 24:56.540
killed the kid with the candlestick.

24:56.540 --> 24:58.130
- You're catching on.
(clicks fingers)

24:58.130 --> 25:01.400
Except for the alleged part,
but we'll work on that.

25:01.400 --> 25:03.750
- Why kill JR in the first place?

25:03.750 --> 25:07.120
- Oh, he had a little
trouble when he was younger,

25:07.120 --> 25:08.380
hot water.

25:08.380 --> 25:09.950
- What makes you think that?

25:09.950 --> 25:11.160
- I have a source.

25:11.160 --> 25:12.063
- A source.

25:13.450 --> 25:16.700
You've been here 12 hours,
and you have a source.

25:16.700 --> 25:18.643
- Fine, don't believe me.

25:19.488 --> 25:23.230
(gentle tinkling music)

25:23.230 --> 25:25.380
- Let's see what JR's
got on his rap sheet.

25:30.340 --> 25:33.230
At 10 he got busted for breaking

25:33.230 --> 25:34.963
Christmas lights at the YMCA.

25:36.319 --> 25:39.913
14, he pinched a kids bike
and took it for a joyride.

25:41.680 --> 25:46.540
16, he lit a bag of dog crap on fire

25:46.540 --> 25:48.073
on the principles front porch.

25:49.880 --> 25:52.530
Wow, public enemy number one.

25:52.530 --> 25:54.790
- Maybe he had a good lawyer,

25:54.790 --> 25:57.220
who kept the hot water off his record.

25:57.220 --> 25:59.060
- JR lives outside city limits,

25:59.060 --> 26:00.940
the County Sheriff handles
everything out there.

26:00.940 --> 26:03.430
- Well then why don't you
call the County Sheriff?

26:03.430 --> 26:04.950
- And what am I gonna say,

26:04.950 --> 26:07.160
yo, I got this kid, he doesn't call home,

26:07.160 --> 26:09.630
I'm think he got whacked by a candlestick.

26:09.630 --> 26:12.873
You got a body, evidence,
leads, motive, anything?

26:12.873 --> 26:14.820
Well I'm a little light on details,

26:14.820 --> 26:16.597
but I do know that the murderer

26:16.597 --> 26:18.790
was a heck of a house cleaner.

26:18.790 --> 26:20.600
I'm dyin' to make that call.

26:20.600 --> 26:22.222
- Fine I'll make it, I'm not shy.

26:22.222 --> 26:23.893
- Really, I hadn't noticed.

26:24.850 --> 26:26.260
Leave the red stuff.

26:26.260 --> 26:27.093
- The blood.

26:27.093 --> 26:28.430
- Whatever, I'll have
the lab check it out,

26:28.430 --> 26:31.360
if it is JR's blood,
maybe I'll have something

26:31.360 --> 26:33.140
to talk to the Sheriffs office about.

26:33.140 --> 26:33.973
- Hmm.

26:35.808 --> 26:39.433
Someone should be arrested
for making coffee this bad.

26:39.433 --> 26:41.673
- We had to fire our barista, budget cuts.

26:41.673 --> 26:43.380
- Just add some salt and some nutmeg

26:43.380 --> 26:46.120
before you brew the coffee,
take all the bitterness out.

26:46.120 --> 26:48.053
- We like bitter, it keeps us mean.

26:52.010 --> 26:54.520
You haven't mentioned
this to Ruth have you?

26:54.520 --> 26:57.020
- No I didn't want to upset her.

26:57.020 --> 27:00.950
- Me either, you're on
vacation up here, so vacation.

27:00.950 --> 27:03.159
Sleep, shop, work on your tan.

27:03.159 --> 27:06.490
- Should I get my nails
done as well, manipedi.

27:06.490 --> 27:09.850
- Yeah, that works, just
don't try to be a cop.

27:09.850 --> 27:12.090
- Oh, absolutely not,
wouldn't dream of it,

27:12.090 --> 27:12.963
not for a nano.

27:17.801 --> 27:22.801
(phone dialing)
(gentle tinkling music)

27:32.056 --> 27:34.723
(phone ringing)

27:36.110 --> 27:37.833
- Nigel Forsythe the third.

27:37.833 --> 27:39.163
- Nigel it's me.

27:40.060 --> 27:43.563
- Oh hey me, it's me too.

27:44.560 --> 27:46.660
Well actually it's me three isn't it,

27:46.660 --> 27:49.380
because I am the third after all.

27:49.380 --> 27:51.180
- It's the middle of the
night, what are you doing?

27:51.180 --> 27:53.550
- I'm working, you know me,

27:53.550 --> 27:56.160
nose to the old grindstone 24/7.

27:56.160 --> 27:57.313
- Working on what?

27:57.313 --> 28:00.533
- A Pru Pointer on vodka
that we talked about.

28:01.800 --> 28:03.730
I had no idea, it turns out,

28:03.730 --> 28:06.860
that vodka is one of the
wonders of the world.

28:06.860 --> 28:08.940
It's, it's, it's just
amazing what it can do.

28:08.940 --> 28:11.882
Did, did you know that it's
a great facial cleaner.

28:11.882 --> 28:13.760
You just, you just rub it on your face

28:13.760 --> 28:16.150
and squeaky clean pores bingo.

28:16.150 --> 28:17.890
- You silly twit, you're
absorbing the alcohol

28:17.890 --> 28:21.010
through your skin, you're
as drunk as a loon.

28:21.010 --> 28:22.260
- How drunk do loons get?

28:23.110 --> 28:25.610
- Never mind, look, I want
you to come to Wyoming.

28:26.740 --> 28:29.200
- You're on vacation,
what do you need me for?

28:29.200 --> 28:30.380
- I miss you.

28:30.380 --> 28:33.370
- Oh come on, you don't miss anyone.

28:33.370 --> 28:36.050
- Whatever, take three
aspirin, pack a bag,

28:36.050 --> 28:36.883
and get on a plane.

28:36.883 --> 28:37.716
- Do I have too?

28:37.716 --> 28:41.373
I'd hate to interrupt this
very, very important research.

28:43.640 --> 28:45.750
Oh, did you know that vodka is excellent

28:45.750 --> 28:47.650
for cleaning the hair off your tongue?

28:53.050 --> 28:54.340
- Good morning Prudence.

28:54.340 --> 28:55.500
- Good morning.

28:55.500 --> 28:56.800
- Ready for some breakfast?

28:56.800 --> 28:59.800
- Yes I am, did JR call?

28:59.800 --> 29:00.633
- No.

29:02.400 --> 29:06.140
- Ruth I'm curious, when
my mother came to stay here

29:06.140 --> 29:09.170
did you ever have a chance to talk to her?

29:09.170 --> 29:10.790
- A little, when she wasn't too busy.

29:10.790 --> 29:13.393
- Of course, her work.

29:14.300 --> 29:16.543
- No, she hardly worked when she was here.

29:17.870 --> 29:19.253
- Really, what did she do?

29:20.210 --> 29:21.720
- I think she enjoyed herself.

29:21.720 --> 29:22.683
- Enjoyed herself.

29:24.360 --> 29:27.150
All I ever remember is her working.

29:27.150 --> 29:29.834
I mean, I knew what she was, a columnist,

29:29.834 --> 29:34.313
a sort of celebrity but I
never really knew who she was,

29:35.650 --> 29:36.883
not as a woman really.

29:38.034 --> 29:41.370
- I didn't know her that
well, but I do remember this.

29:41.370 --> 29:44.793
When she was happy, everybody
around her was happy too.

29:46.500 --> 29:47.600
- What made her happy?

29:49.450 --> 29:50.793
- Just a moment.

29:59.890 --> 30:01.340
This belonged to your mother,

30:02.470 --> 30:04.010
she wanted it kept here at the lodge,

30:04.010 --> 30:06.055
even after she was gone.

30:06.055 --> 30:07.410
- Why?

30:07.410 --> 30:09.190
- I'm not sure, maybe
it's because the lodge

30:09.190 --> 30:10.993
held so many fond memories for her.

30:14.038 --> 30:16.621
(gentle music)

30:49.740 --> 30:52.160
- There are dozens of
letters in this box Ruth.

30:52.160 --> 30:54.660
Written by someone who had
to have been her lover.

30:55.934 --> 30:59.043
I mean they're so beautiful and romantic.

31:01.020 --> 31:04.853
My mother had a lover, my God.

31:06.260 --> 31:08.680
I mean, do you have any
idea who wrote these?

31:08.680 --> 31:12.305
- No, she didn't talk
to me about such things.

31:12.305 --> 31:13.703
(gong chiming)
Excuse me.

31:23.737 --> 31:26.487
(Ruth screaming)

31:30.455 --> 31:33.038
(somber music)

31:49.834 --> 31:50.667
- Ruth?

31:52.866 --> 31:53.699
- JR.

31:55.314 --> 31:57.673
- I'm detective Jilson,
County Sheriffs department.

31:58.640 --> 32:00.440
Some hikers found Mrs Vigil's son

32:00.440 --> 32:05.010
out at Diablo Canyon, he'd
er, fallen from a hiking trail

32:05.010 --> 32:06.150
near the summit.

32:07.771 --> 32:12.021
- (crying) He, he's dead Prudence.

32:13.871 --> 32:14.704
JR's dead.

32:30.267 --> 32:33.063
Hikers found this suicide
note on the mountain.

32:34.070 --> 32:34.983
- Oh my God.

32:36.230 --> 32:37.493
- Doesn't make sense.

32:38.750 --> 32:41.690
JR had his ups and downs
just like anybody else.

32:41.690 --> 32:43.990
He loved his life, he
wouldn't have wasted it,

32:45.450 --> 32:46.820
especially not like this.

32:47.844 --> 32:49.360
- What do you mean?

32:49.360 --> 32:52.370
- JR was terrified of
heights, he hated to fly,

32:52.370 --> 32:54.833
he wouldn't even ride in an elevator.

32:56.740 --> 32:59.250
Why would he climb a mountain too --

32:59.250 --> 33:01.350
- I have no clue.

33:01.350 --> 33:02.880
- Well aren't you suspicious?

33:02.880 --> 33:04.150
I mean this doesn't make sense.

33:04.150 --> 33:05.690
- Most of life doesn't make sense,

33:05.690 --> 33:07.270
starting with the big bang.

33:07.270 --> 33:08.930
- JR didn't jump.

33:08.930 --> 33:10.780
- A lot of people think he did.

33:10.780 --> 33:12.830
- Is the coroner going to do an autopsy?

33:12.830 --> 33:15.030
- Coroners don't usually
do autopsies on suicides,

33:15.030 --> 33:18.590
especially where the
cause of death is obvious.

33:18.590 --> 33:20.275
- Where is Diablo Canyon?

33:20.275 --> 33:21.653
- West of town, why?

33:22.560 --> 33:25.300
- We should start our investigation there.

33:25.300 --> 33:26.830
- What investigation?

33:26.830 --> 33:28.480
- Find out who murdered Ruth's son.

33:28.480 --> 33:29.890
- We went over this already.

33:29.890 --> 33:30.860
- We did.

33:30.860 --> 33:33.310
- We did, but read my lips again,

33:33.310 --> 33:34.860
this is out of my jurisdiction.

33:35.820 --> 33:37.440
- Guess what I don't have a jurisdiction,

33:37.440 --> 33:38.350
I'll go there myself.

33:38.350 --> 33:40.990
- No you won't you go
out there by yourself,

33:40.990 --> 33:43.597
you'll get lost, you'll die.

33:43.597 --> 33:45.840
Your bones will be
picked clean by vultures.

33:45.840 --> 33:49.660
- Hmm, sounds like an after
Christmas sale in New York.

33:49.660 --> 33:52.800
- Even worse, I'll have to
write the whole sordid mess up.

33:52.800 --> 33:55.753
- Why, the sordid mess won't
be in your jurisdiction?

33:57.113 --> 33:59.810
- (sighs) I'll get the Sheriffs
report off the internet

33:59.810 --> 34:00.643
and drive you.

34:01.800 --> 34:02.850
- Not on that I hope.

34:05.120 --> 34:06.520
- You ever been on a bike?

34:06.520 --> 34:09.763
- Never, I'm just not that
keen to be an organ donor.

34:10.739 --> 34:12.719
- Then you haven't lived.

34:12.719 --> 34:15.290
- If I rode a motorcycle I'd be living?

34:15.290 --> 34:17.090
- Well it would be a start.

34:17.090 --> 34:20.132
I'll get the car, you'll need
some decent hiking shoes.

34:21.219 --> 34:23.310
- Oh these are fine, I'm a New Yorker,

34:23.310 --> 34:24.159
we walk anywhere.

34:25.330 --> 34:28.090
Besides we need to be at
the airport in 20 minutes.

34:28.090 --> 34:28.922
- Why?

34:34.434 --> 34:38.966
- Come on.

34:38.966 --> 34:42.216
(equipment clattering)

34:48.312 --> 34:50.812
- Oh there he is, hello Nigel.

34:53.350 --> 34:55.460
- This is like a gag right?

34:55.460 --> 34:57.570
- No gag, that's Nigel.

34:57.570 --> 34:59.320
- Why is he rubbing his head with a lemon?

34:59.320 --> 35:00.653
- It cures headaches.

35:01.760 --> 35:04.313
I'm afraid he has a wicked hangover.

35:08.650 --> 35:09.483
- This guy actually works for you?

35:09.483 --> 35:11.320
- He runs my lab.

35:11.320 --> 35:13.493
He'll be a lot of help
in the investigation.

35:15.030 --> 35:15.993
He's very talented.

35:17.380 --> 35:18.213
- At what?

35:23.408 --> 35:26.575
(Pru panting heavily)

35:39.170 --> 35:42.330
- I feel like a bloody mountain goat,

35:42.330 --> 35:44.450
why can't we drive up here?

35:44.450 --> 35:46.540
- You need four wheel drive,

35:46.540 --> 35:48.090
and I thought New Yorkers like to walk.

35:48.090 --> 35:50.950
- This isn't a walk, it's a death march.

35:50.950 --> 35:52.000
- We're almost there.

35:52.950 --> 35:54.650
- You're enjoying this aren't you?

35:55.561 --> 35:58.710
(Pru grunting and panting)

35:58.710 --> 36:01.377
(river running)

36:05.543 --> 36:08.020
- This is where the hikers
found JR's suicide note.

36:08.020 --> 36:08.853
- Okay.

36:10.236 --> 36:12.236
- He came down the hillside right there,

36:14.750 --> 36:16.850
crossed to the edge, and jumped from here.

36:17.930 --> 36:20.370
Yellow police tape at
the bottom of the cliff

36:20.370 --> 36:22.603
is where the hikers found the body.

36:23.800 --> 36:25.400
- He was terrified of heights,

36:25.400 --> 36:26.880
he would never have
tried to commit suicide

36:26.880 --> 36:28.560
by jumping off a mountain.

36:28.560 --> 36:30.410
- He left a suicide note here,

36:30.410 --> 36:33.400
they found the body down
there, connect the dots.

36:33.400 --> 36:34.770
- Did you see the note?

36:34.770 --> 36:35.603
- No.

36:35.603 --> 36:37.180
- Well I did, it was typed.

36:37.180 --> 36:38.990
I mean who types a suicide note.

36:38.990 --> 36:41.330
- Methodical, organized people.

36:41.330 --> 36:42.620
- If that's where they found the body,

36:42.620 --> 36:43.870
he didn't jump from here.

36:44.710 --> 36:46.000
- How'd he get there, fly?

36:46.000 --> 36:48.470
- He was pushed, or he was unconscious,

36:48.470 --> 36:51.203
or you know worse he was
dropped over the edge.

36:52.200 --> 36:53.890
- What are you talkin' about?

36:53.890 --> 36:55.810
- If he'd jumped out from the cliff

36:55.810 --> 36:58.980
then he would have missed that
rock outcropping completely

36:58.980 --> 37:01.760
and he would have landed,
right there by that tree.

37:01.760 --> 37:04.440
But if he'd been pushed or dumped,

37:04.440 --> 37:05.750
then he would have hit the outcropping

37:05.750 --> 37:07.920
which would have altered
the trajectory of his fall,

37:07.920 --> 37:09.560
and he would have landed
you know, duh duh duh,

37:09.560 --> 37:11.900
right where they found the body.

37:11.900 --> 37:13.920
- Nigel you're brilliant,
didn't I tell you

37:13.920 --> 37:14.770
he was brilliant.

37:16.040 --> 37:16.923
- Too many times.

37:17.930 --> 37:20.373
Look, if the kid was afraid of heights,

37:21.500 --> 37:24.020
I'm guessing he didn't
just come take a swan dive

37:24.020 --> 37:25.660
from the cliff.

37:25.660 --> 37:29.060
He probably inched out to
the edge, took a deep breath,

37:29.060 --> 37:32.190
looked out, said a hail Mary and dropped.

37:32.190 --> 37:33.950
Hit the rock outcropping on the way down,

37:33.950 --> 37:36.023
and landed right where he was found.

37:37.300 --> 37:39.600
- Not bad, but wrong.

37:39.600 --> 37:43.010
- Wrong, I've been a
detective for, I don't know,

37:43.010 --> 37:46.310
25 years, you've been a
detective for lets see,

37:46.310 --> 37:47.193
for never.

37:48.580 --> 37:51.443
- Prudence, look at this.

38:01.033 --> 38:02.200
- What did you find?

38:02.200 --> 38:04.730
- Boot prints, someone came down this hill

38:04.730 --> 38:06.100
and then walked back up again,

38:06.100 --> 38:08.683
and it looks like they
were wearing cowboy boots.

38:10.070 --> 38:13.020
- Nigel found cowboy boot prints.

38:13.020 --> 38:16.290
- Cowboy boots in
Wyoming, wow the kids hot.

38:16.290 --> 38:17.850
- The prints coming down the hill

38:17.850 --> 38:22.180
are an average 57% deeper, and 33% wider

38:22.180 --> 38:24.170
than the boot prints
going back up the hill.

38:24.170 --> 38:25.560
- So someone was heavier
coming down the hill,

38:25.560 --> 38:27.850
then going back up, so what?

38:27.850 --> 38:29.680
- Well apart from the
incredible crash diet,

38:29.680 --> 38:31.560
how else would you explain
the sudden weight loss?

38:31.560 --> 38:34.070
- This is a camping
area, someone came down

38:34.070 --> 38:36.640
carrying something heavy like a backpack

38:36.640 --> 38:38.710
full of food, water, fishing gear --

38:38.710 --> 38:40.870
- Or a body that they pushed,

38:40.870 --> 38:42.440
or dumped off the cliff,

38:42.440 --> 38:44.010
and then they walked
right back up the hill.

38:44.010 --> 38:46.450
- Limped, the boot prints indicate a limp,

38:46.450 --> 38:47.710
favoring the right leg.

38:47.710 --> 38:49.590
- Those prints disappear way before

38:49.590 --> 38:50.650
you get to the cliff.

38:50.650 --> 38:52.520
- Because there's rock there, not mud.

38:52.520 --> 38:54.070
- Fine, but whoever came down the hill

38:54.070 --> 38:55.940
could have gone anywhere from there.

38:55.940 --> 38:59.716
- Not with a body, dead weight
is very difficult to carry.

38:59.716 --> 39:03.400
- (laughs) Whatever, we're done here.

39:03.400 --> 39:04.750
Go on up to the top of the hill,

39:04.750 --> 39:06.353
I'll get the car and meet yah.

39:06.353 --> 39:08.077
- The car, I thought you told me

39:08.077 --> 39:10.290
you couldn't drive up here.

39:10.290 --> 39:12.090
- I said we needed four wheel drive,

39:13.040 --> 39:14.634
I have four wheel drive.

39:14.634 --> 39:17.134
(phone rings)

39:18.069 --> 39:20.800
- I can't believe this, he made us walk

39:20.800 --> 39:22.250
all the way up here
just because I wouldn't

39:22.250 --> 39:23.510
follow his advice and change my shoes.

39:23.510 --> 39:25.993
I mean it's just so
bloody childish isn't it.

39:26.960 --> 39:28.020
- Your feet must be killing you,

39:28.020 --> 39:29.743
why didn't you just change your shoes?

39:29.743 --> 39:31.820
- Because I didn't want to, did I.

39:31.820 --> 39:35.040
- Wow, now that is totally childish.

39:35.040 --> 39:36.540
- Mind your own beeswax Nigel.

39:39.257 --> 39:41.790
- The lab results on your
blood sample came back.

39:41.790 --> 39:43.010
- And?

39:43.010 --> 39:44.330
- You were right, it's blood.

39:44.330 --> 39:46.010
- Yes, I knew it, I could feel it.

39:46.010 --> 39:48.082
I had this sixth sense,
you know what I mean.

39:48.082 --> 39:50.610
Detectives, the really good ones,

39:50.610 --> 39:52.780
they must have that sort
of feeling all the time.

39:52.780 --> 39:54.800
- It wasn't JR's blood type.

39:54.800 --> 39:58.573
His is AB negative, the blood
in his house is O positive.

39:59.540 --> 40:02.840
- The murderers, JR resisted, he got cut.

40:02.840 --> 40:04.920
- Assuming there is a murderer.

40:04.920 --> 40:08.410
Which means 35% of the entire population

40:08.410 --> 40:11.853
are now suspects, this
pig doesn't have wings.

40:13.070 --> 40:15.303
- Pardon.
- Doesn't fly.

40:21.938 --> 40:25.105
(gentle somber music)

40:44.440 --> 40:45.273
- I'm sorry.

41:03.620 --> 41:05.070
- I know how this sounds but,

41:07.077 --> 41:09.450
I don't think JR committed suicide.

41:09.450 --> 41:11.290
- What are you talking about?

41:11.290 --> 41:12.470
- I think somebody killed him,

41:12.470 --> 41:14.970
and tried to make it look like a suicide.

41:14.970 --> 41:16.640
- Who'd do that, why?

41:16.640 --> 41:17.473
- I don't know.

41:19.630 --> 41:21.465
- Have you told the police?

41:21.465 --> 41:24.683
- A detective here in town,
he doesn't take me seriously.

41:26.100 --> 41:28.450
- Do you have any proof, any evidence?

41:28.450 --> 41:31.803
- Some, but not enough to
convince the police, not yet.

41:32.640 --> 41:33.980
- You haven't told any
of this to Ruth have yah?

41:33.980 --> 41:35.830
- No, no, I didn't want to upset her.

41:36.760 --> 41:39.040
- Listen I have some contacts
at the Sheriffs office,

41:39.040 --> 41:41.861
I'll make a few calls discreetly
and see what I can find.

41:41.861 --> 41:42.787
- That's fantastic.

41:42.787 --> 41:44.687
- And if you find anything run it past me

41:44.687 --> 41:47.160
and I'll make sure those police
don't brush you off okay.

41:47.160 --> 41:48.653
- Absolutely.
- Alright.

41:50.340 --> 41:52.950
Listen you're very kind to be
concerned about Ruth and JR.

41:52.950 --> 41:55.120
- So are you, thank you.

41:57.638 --> 42:00.721
(car engine revving)

42:17.300 --> 42:20.130
- Is it really necessary that I'm here?

42:20.130 --> 42:23.760
- Of course, I'm working,
you're my assistant aren't you?

42:23.760 --> 42:26.910
- Well yeah, granted, but
work doesn't usually involve

42:26.910 --> 42:28.313
tryin' to solve murders.

42:34.049 --> 42:35.890
(he laughs)

42:35.890 --> 42:39.630
- Ah, shoe polish, my
grandfather developed

42:39.630 --> 42:40.950
that pointer for your mom.

42:40.950 --> 42:43.470
- Forsythe the first was brilliant.

42:43.470 --> 42:45.880
- The first solved household problems like

42:45.880 --> 42:49.150
Mozart wrote symphonies, I
stand humbly on the shoulders

42:49.150 --> 42:49.983
of that giant.

42:51.450 --> 42:54.320
Okay, okay, what are we looking for?

42:54.320 --> 42:57.630
- Something that might tell
us what happened to JR.

42:57.630 --> 42:59.722
- I'll check the bedroom.

42:59.722 --> 43:00.555
- Okay.

43:04.147 --> 43:07.480
(bouncy tinkling music)

44:01.809 --> 44:02.642
(laughs) Eureka.

44:07.520 --> 44:08.520
- What did you find?

44:13.310 --> 44:14.237
- It's in French.

44:15.567 --> 44:18.050
- I'm sorry I'm fluent in three languages,

44:18.050 --> 44:19.880
can read another four, but French is

44:20.928 --> 44:24.678
(speaking foreign language).

44:25.545 --> 44:26.550
- What?

44:26.550 --> 44:28.570
- It's German for, French
is a boring language

44:28.570 --> 44:29.983
spoken by arrogant fools.

44:32.040 --> 44:33.720
- The only French I know
should never be spoken

44:33.720 --> 44:34.870
outside of the bedroom.

44:36.300 --> 44:38.210
You know what petite moi means?

44:38.210 --> 44:41.763
- No, no and knowing you I
don't wanna know, not ever.

44:43.253 --> 44:44.240
- You're blushing.

44:44.240 --> 44:45.547
- No I'm not.

44:45.547 --> 44:47.410
- You're going red as a
beet, that's so adorable.

44:47.410 --> 44:49.470
- Can we move on please.

44:49.470 --> 44:52.610
Just look at these
pictures, there's photos

44:52.610 --> 44:53.573
of a county map.

44:55.470 --> 44:57.143
Maybe JR had an office somewhere.

45:02.407 --> 45:04.960
- Hey, check out the window
reflected in this mirror.

45:04.960 --> 45:07.793
You see the edge of that sign, TET.

45:08.900 --> 45:10.950
We find that sign and we find this room.

45:10.950 --> 45:12.329
- And you'll find it.

45:12.329 --> 45:13.162
- Yavol.

45:16.107 --> 45:19.200
- Tassajaro, that's strange.

45:19.200 --> 45:21.190
- Strange good, or strange bad?

45:21.190 --> 45:24.470
- I don't know, anyway we've got a map,

45:24.470 --> 45:27.260
we have a French document and
we have the lead on an office.

45:27.260 --> 45:28.830
We're on a roll Nigel.

45:28.830 --> 45:32.840
- Oh great, any idea what
direction we're rolling in?

45:32.840 --> 45:34.960
- We'll go to the Sheriffs office.

45:34.960 --> 45:37.750
- Drop me off at the lodge,
I've had my outing for the day.

45:37.750 --> 45:38.870
- What are you afraid off?

45:38.870 --> 45:41.883
- You arguing with the
Sheriff, me going to jail.

45:44.927 --> 45:48.177
(light dramatic music)

46:09.690 --> 46:11.460
- That's a candlestick Miss McCoy.

46:11.460 --> 46:13.003
- And a murder weapon.

46:14.030 --> 46:15.870
- JR Vigil wasn't murdered.

46:15.870 --> 46:17.207
- Well there's a growing body of evidence,

46:17.207 --> 46:18.950
that says that he was.

46:18.950 --> 46:19.900
- Body of evidence.

46:21.160 --> 46:23.363
- Well, maybe not a body but,

46:24.860 --> 46:27.630
there are a lot of people who
believe that he was murdered,

46:27.630 --> 46:28.463
professionals.

46:28.463 --> 46:30.530
- What sort of professionals?

46:30.530 --> 46:32.170
- Well a prominent lawyer in town,

46:32.170 --> 46:34.060
and Detective Duncan.

46:34.060 --> 46:36.490
- Duncan buys this candlestick idea?

46:36.490 --> 46:38.900
- Detective Duncan's very intrigued.

46:38.900 --> 46:40.163
See the gouges.

46:42.020 --> 46:42.853
- And?

46:44.300 --> 46:46.330
- I know Ruth Vigil asked that an autopsy

46:46.330 --> 46:48.100
be performed on her son.

46:48.100 --> 46:49.220
- Yes ma'am she did.

46:49.220 --> 46:52.190
- All you have to do is
examine the coroners report.

46:52.190 --> 46:53.780
If there was trauma to JR's head.

46:53.780 --> 46:57.500
- The boy fell 300 feet
down the side of a mountain.

46:57.500 --> 46:59.690
There's head trauma, a lot of it.

46:59.690 --> 47:02.240
- The forensic experts will
see that the head wounds

47:02.240 --> 47:05.360
could only have been
caused by this candlestick.

47:05.360 --> 47:07.156
- You seem pretty sure about this.

47:07.156 --> 47:07.989
- I am.

47:09.750 --> 47:13.160
If I'm wrong I'll give your wife Corki

47:13.160 --> 47:15.003
an autographed Pru Pointers t-shirt.

47:18.060 --> 47:20.877
- Pru Pointer, you're,
you're that Prudence.

47:20.877 --> 47:22.526
- That's right.

47:22.526 --> 47:23.359
(bangs desk)
(laughs)

47:23.359 --> 47:24.890
your wife's one of my biggest fans.

47:24.890 --> 47:26.360
- Yeah, yeah.

47:26.360 --> 47:28.330
- So how's the snoring problem?

47:28.330 --> 47:31.560
- My, (laughs) cured.

47:31.560 --> 47:34.690
That tennis ball you had
Corki sew into my pajamas,

47:34.690 --> 47:36.150
keeps me from rolling over.

47:36.150 --> 47:37.473
- Nigel my assistant
came up with that one.

47:37.473 --> 47:39.233
- Well he's a damn genius.

47:41.410 --> 47:45.664
Alright, I'll have forensics
check out the candlestick.

47:45.664 --> 47:46.730
- Fantastic.

47:46.730 --> 47:48.933
- But I've got one other little problem.

47:50.860 --> 47:52.853
My hunting dog, Rufus.

47:54.866 --> 47:57.820
- Ah.
- He's got gas,

47:57.820 --> 48:01.223
bad gas, we've had to
fumigate the house twice.

48:02.170 --> 48:03.487
We really need your help on this one,

48:03.487 --> 48:04.653
you got any ideas?

48:05.780 --> 48:09.200
- Put half a cup of plain
yogurt in Rufus' dog food,

48:09.200 --> 48:11.763
twice daily, it'll deflate him.

48:13.030 --> 48:14.330
- (laughs) Yogurt?
- Hmm.

48:15.830 --> 48:19.000
- That works, you might
have just saved my marriage.

48:19.000 --> 48:20.950
I thought I was gonna have
to choose between Corki

48:20.950 --> 48:21.783
and Rufus.

48:22.830 --> 48:24.460
- Would that have been hard to do?

48:24.460 --> 48:25.293
- Well,

48:28.690 --> 48:30.243
Rufus is a damn good bird dog.

48:32.299 --> 48:35.382
(light bouncy music)

48:41.510 --> 48:44.743
- I just faxed it to you,
a document of some kind.

48:45.870 --> 48:47.030
No, don't fly out Francoise,

48:47.030 --> 48:49.230
I just want you to
translate it and call me.

48:50.277 --> 48:53.003
Yeah, I miss you too, kiss kiss.

48:54.120 --> 48:55.873
Headache?
- A killer.

48:57.460 --> 49:00.933
Eddie was here, he talked
to Jilson about your visit,

49:00.933 --> 49:02.310
he's not a happy camper.

49:02.310 --> 49:05.450
- No, gee I'm so sorry about that.

49:05.450 --> 49:06.570
- He said he want's you to chill.

49:06.570 --> 49:09.180
- Chill, what am I a bottle of chardonnay,

49:09.180 --> 49:10.740
he has a bloody nerve.

49:10.740 --> 49:14.573
- Please, just don't start,
I think I found the room.

49:16.470 --> 49:20.310
Here, the lettering looked commercial

49:20.310 --> 49:22.690
So I searched local business names,

49:22.690 --> 49:25.463
all with the letters T, E
and T in them in that order.

49:26.364 --> 49:27.220
I turned up with like dozens of them,

49:27.220 --> 49:28.820
all with the word teton in them.

49:28.820 --> 49:30.310
- Why teton?

49:30.310 --> 49:34.680
- Oh because the Grand Tetons,
the mountains were named

49:34.680 --> 49:37.730
by the French explorers who
called the three highest peaks

49:37.730 --> 49:42.363
of the range le trois Teton,
the three breasts, or nipples.

49:43.940 --> 49:46.443
You know, depending on the translation.

49:47.440 --> 49:52.440
So I figured that if JR kept
some sort of secret hideaway

49:52.540 --> 49:55.613
that he wouldn't choose an auto
mechanic or a dry cleaners.

49:55.613 --> 49:56.584
- A motel.

49:56.584 --> 49:59.850
- Oh no, no actually I think
he would choose a motel.

49:59.850 --> 50:03.040
- That's what I mean, do
you have a name, address?

50:03.040 --> 50:05.320
- Naturally, there's only
one motel with the name

50:05.320 --> 50:07.100
that matches the letters in that photo,

50:07.100 --> 50:09.053
the Teton Chalet Motel.

50:10.790 --> 50:12.330
- Well it's definitely the same sign.

50:12.330 --> 50:15.410
- Hmm, okay, now we just find a window

50:15.410 --> 50:18.130
that looks out on the
sign at the same angle.

50:18.130 --> 50:19.830
There's only three, piece of cake.

50:26.850 --> 50:27.683
No.

50:31.280 --> 50:34.363
(car engine rumbles)

50:36.289 --> 50:39.456
(light, bouncy music)

50:54.319 --> 50:56.152
- I think that worked.

50:57.172 --> 50:58.643
We can't look suspicious.

50:58.643 --> 51:02.730
- (laughs) You don't
think that that, that,

51:02.730 --> 51:03.600
- It's called a kiss.

51:03.600 --> 51:06.930
- Moment, just made us
look totally suspicious.

51:06.930 --> 51:09.690
I mean what kind of people
just kiss each other like that

51:09.690 --> 51:10.610
in the middle of the day.

51:10.610 --> 51:12.223
- People who come to places like this.

51:12.223 --> 51:13.056
- Oh.

51:22.350 --> 51:23.640
This is the same window as in the picture.

51:23.640 --> 51:24.613
- Are you sure?

51:25.530 --> 51:29.360
- Yeah, absolutely, yeah it's
basic euclidean geometry,

51:29.360 --> 51:32.760
the cosine of the angle formed
by the sine in the window

51:32.760 --> 51:35.480
frame in conjunction with
the slope of the shadows

51:35.480 --> 51:37.110
cast by the setting sun and --

51:37.110 --> 51:38.810
- You're making all this up right?

51:40.075 --> 51:41.003
- Pretty much.

51:42.070 --> 51:44.170
- So how are you sure
this is the same window?

51:44.170 --> 51:45.803
- You can see the map on the wall.

51:56.500 --> 51:58.263
- Liquid dish washing detergent.

52:00.910 --> 52:03.333
Nigel, dish washing detergent.

52:06.563 --> 52:08.090
Hair pins.

52:08.090 --> 52:09.670
Pencil.

52:09.670 --> 52:11.763
Straw, now cover me.

52:19.504 --> 52:20.972
(lock clicks open)

52:20.972 --> 52:21.805
Bingo.

52:32.790 --> 52:34.463
Nigel, check out the laptop.

52:42.626 --> 52:46.070
There's the sign, and
the map to Tassajaro.

52:46.070 --> 52:48.880
- This is JR's computer,
the case has his name

52:48.880 --> 52:50.580
and address on it.

52:50.580 --> 52:53.610
- Why would JR have a map of Tassajaro?

52:53.610 --> 52:55.433
And I wonder what those
X's on the map mean.

53:05.564 --> 53:08.731
(car door slams shut)

53:12.750 --> 53:14.250
- JR flew to Paris last month.

53:15.690 --> 53:18.190
- Well that explains the French document,

53:18.190 --> 53:19.890
see what else you can
find, take the computer,

53:19.890 --> 53:21.033
I'll check upstairs.

53:30.253 --> 53:33.003
(dramatic music)

53:35.471 --> 53:39.730
(knocking on door)
(doorknob rattling)

53:39.730 --> 53:41.793
- No housekeeping, thanks.

53:42.905 --> 53:46.306
(muffled gunshot)

53:46.306 --> 53:47.843
Prudence.

53:47.843 --> 53:52.843
(banging on door)
- Go out the back.

53:53.180 --> 53:55.884
(muffled gunshot)

53:55.884 --> 53:57.634
- There's no way out!

53:59.392 --> 54:01.142
- Get the table lamp.

54:04.184 --> 54:06.529
(Nigel screams)

54:06.529 --> 54:07.362
Hit him.

54:11.156 --> 54:14.406
(Man groaning in pain)

54:16.116 --> 54:17.949
Stay down you plonker.

54:21.047 --> 54:26.047
(car engine revving)
(tires squealing)

54:34.795 --> 54:38.163
(both breathing heavily)

54:38.163 --> 54:39.690
Why can't I ever remember
that bloody mantra

54:39.690 --> 54:40.523
when I need it?

54:40.523 --> 54:42.560
- Just forget your mantra,
just call the police

54:42.560 --> 54:43.990
and report an attempted murder.

54:43.990 --> 54:46.420
- Are you daft Nigel, we
can't call the police.

54:46.420 --> 54:47.253
- Why not?

54:47.253 --> 54:48.620
- Because I'm not
interested in being arrested

54:48.620 --> 54:50.720
for the several serious
crimes we just committed.

54:50.720 --> 54:52.000
- Serious crimes, what are you --

54:52.000 --> 54:53.600
- Breaking and entering, larceny,

54:53.600 --> 54:54.689
assault and battery.

54:54.689 --> 54:55.920
- Oh God.

54:55.920 --> 54:57.160
- Although I'd certainly argue

54:57.160 --> 54:58.587
bashing that wanker was in self defense.

54:58.587 --> 55:00.460
- Of course it was self defense,

55:00.460 --> 55:02.260
he was trying to kill us.

55:02.260 --> 55:03.940
What makes you think
he won't try it again?

55:03.940 --> 55:05.705
- I don't, he could.

55:05.705 --> 55:09.020
(phone ringing)

55:09.020 --> 55:14.020
Hello, Jeffrey, oh, what are we doing?

55:14.690 --> 55:17.880
Well I mean a lot of things, relaxing,

55:17.880 --> 55:21.597
reading, meeting people,
having adventures.

55:21.597 --> 55:22.430
(Nigel groans)

55:22.430 --> 55:25.130
For example, someone just
tried to kill Nigel and me,

55:25.130 --> 55:26.730
there were bullets
flying, glass shattering.

55:26.730 --> 55:27.890
- [Jeffrey] What are you talking about,

55:27.890 --> 55:29.035
who tried to kill you?

55:29.035 --> 55:30.671
What in God's name are
you doing out there,

55:30.671 --> 55:31.668
you're supposed to be on vacation.

55:31.668 --> 55:32.923
(police siren wailing)

55:32.923 --> 55:33.756
You're supposed to rest
and relax, not get shot at.

55:33.756 --> 55:35.910
- Gotta run love, we're being
pulled over by the police.

55:35.910 --> 55:37.910
I'll call you if I need a solicitor.

55:37.910 --> 55:39.797
Just shove everything under the seat,

55:39.797 --> 55:41.113
and don't open your mouth.

55:51.357 --> 55:54.357
(suspenseful music)

55:58.940 --> 55:59.773
- Ma'am.

56:01.762 --> 56:04.603
- Hello detective, so
how are things at home?

56:04.603 --> 56:07.640
- Well Corki has loaded up on yogurt,

56:07.640 --> 56:09.880
so we'll keep our fingers crossed.

56:09.880 --> 56:12.210
But things aren't nearly as promising

56:12.210 --> 56:14.810
out at the Teton Chalet Motel.

56:14.810 --> 56:16.430
Someone shot up one of the units real bad.

56:16.430 --> 56:18.070
You wouldn't happen to know
anything about that, would yah?

56:18.070 --> 56:20.823
- Goodness no, no, I'm terrified of guns.

56:22.560 --> 56:24.610
- Maid saw a car leaving the scene,

56:24.610 --> 56:26.100
she didn't get a license
plate but your car

56:26.100 --> 56:27.270
matches her description.

56:27.270 --> 56:28.993
- Oh, that's impossible detective,

56:28.993 --> 56:33.160
we've been out admiring
your gorgeous mountains,

56:33.160 --> 56:34.010
haven't we Nigel?

56:35.040 --> 56:36.390
Bloody massive your Tetons.

56:37.560 --> 56:39.542
- I got the forensics
back on your candlestick.

56:39.542 --> 56:40.430
- And?

56:40.430 --> 56:42.880
- The gouges match the
head trauma on the victim,

56:42.880 --> 56:45.340
and the wood splinters that
we found in the head wounds

56:45.340 --> 56:46.460
match the candlestick.

56:46.460 --> 56:48.010
- So he was murdered?

56:48.010 --> 56:49.030
- It's a little early to say for sure,

56:49.030 --> 56:50.310
but it looks that way.

56:50.310 --> 56:51.640
Now if you have any information.

56:51.640 --> 56:52.473
- Actually --

56:52.473 --> 56:56.270
- We don't have a thing, but
if the candlestick helped

56:56.270 --> 56:57.940
we're delighted to have
made a contribution

56:57.940 --> 57:00.260
towards the preservation of
law and order in Wyoming.

57:00.260 --> 57:01.093
Aren't we Nigel.

57:01.093 --> 57:02.180
- Ah, yeah, we're thrilled.

57:03.209 --> 57:04.610
- When are you folks headin' home?

57:04.610 --> 57:06.520
- As soon as possible.

57:06.520 --> 57:08.620
- That's probably a real good idea, ma'am.

57:11.608 --> 57:15.800
- Ah, oh, that hurts so
much, why did you pinch me?

57:15.800 --> 57:17.890
- I told you not to talk,

57:17.890 --> 57:20.093
you're lucky I didn't cut your tongue out.

57:20.093 --> 57:23.577
(Nigel groans in pain)

57:23.577 --> 57:27.077
(light suspenseful music)

57:31.770 --> 57:34.210
- JR put those marking
on the map for a reason,

57:34.210 --> 57:36.313
call me crazy but I want to know why.

57:50.891 --> 57:52.350
(grunting in pain)

57:52.350 --> 57:54.690
- Oh no, look I'm really
flattered really I am,

57:54.690 --> 57:56.270
but
- Shut up.

57:56.270 --> 57:57.640
- I'd feel terrible if we did anything

57:57.640 --> 57:59.337
to jeopardize our
professional relationship.

57:59.337 --> 58:01.310
- How would you feel if we were killed?

58:01.310 --> 58:02.510
- Really bad, why?

58:02.510 --> 58:05.460
- There's two guys over there,
I don't want them to see us.

58:08.727 --> 58:11.060
You see that truck up there,

58:12.162 --> 58:13.530
I want to get a closer look at it.

58:13.530 --> 58:14.590
- I've got some binoculars.

58:14.590 --> 58:16.730
- No, not from up here, from down there.

58:18.090 --> 58:20.153
- How did I know you were gonna say that.

58:46.977 --> 58:49.540
We've broken so many laws
already I'm getting confused.

58:49.540 --> 58:51.350
Is this breaking and
entering, or trespassing?

58:51.350 --> 58:53.150
- It's being nosy, it's
not against the law,

58:53.150 --> 58:54.290
so watch my back.

59:00.179 --> 59:03.368
(metal clanking)

59:03.368 --> 59:06.763
- Okay leave it, leave it,
those guys are coming back.

59:06.763 --> 59:08.930
Come on, come on, come on.

59:15.670 --> 59:18.837
(car engine rumbling)

59:21.460 --> 59:24.127
(alarm beeping)

01:00:17.030 --> 01:00:17.930
- Nigel come here.

01:00:20.290 --> 01:00:23.240
These holes match the
markings on JR's map.

01:00:23.240 --> 01:00:25.220
Now for some reason they
were important to JR,

01:00:25.220 --> 01:00:26.610
and to those two guys.

01:00:26.610 --> 01:00:29.331
I mean they were trying
to hide every one of them.

01:00:29.331 --> 01:00:31.740
Here what do you think this is?

01:00:31.740 --> 01:00:33.540
- It's trip wire for dynamite,

01:00:33.540 --> 01:00:35.120
that's what caused all these holes.

01:00:35.120 --> 01:00:37.080
- Who'd want to explode dynamite out here?

01:00:37.080 --> 01:00:38.270
- Someone who's looking for oil.

01:00:38.270 --> 01:00:41.170
Look I went online, I
Googled Blacks International,

01:00:41.170 --> 01:00:44.100
it's an oil exploration
company, oil geologists.

01:00:44.100 --> 01:00:46.380
They drill shot holes,
stuff dynamite into them,

01:00:46.380 --> 01:00:48.870
blow it up and then use
the reflected sound waves

01:00:48.870 --> 01:00:50.870
to map the subterranean structure.

01:00:50.870 --> 01:00:52.340
- Okay is this real or
is this more of your

01:00:52.340 --> 01:00:53.890
euclidean cosine nonsense?

01:00:53.890 --> 01:00:57.860
- No, no, that's how
it's done, Google again.

01:00:57.860 --> 01:01:00.610
JR obviously knew someone
was looking for oil out here.

01:01:01.480 --> 01:01:03.670
- My guess is someone wasn't very happy

01:01:03.670 --> 01:01:05.233
that he knew about it.

01:01:08.991 --> 01:01:11.991
(keyboard clicking)

01:01:18.523 --> 01:01:21.310
- Alright fine, just play hard to get,

01:01:21.310 --> 01:01:24.600
it's just a matter of time,
can't keep me out forever.

01:01:24.600 --> 01:01:26.350
- Nigel you've gotta hear this one.

01:01:28.210 --> 01:01:31.940
I hated to see the night
end, I wanted to be with you

01:01:31.940 --> 01:01:35.593
warm and soft in my arms
until the end of time.

01:01:37.170 --> 01:01:39.700
Till the end of time, I mean who writes

01:01:39.700 --> 01:01:41.323
such pathetic poppycock.

01:01:42.280 --> 01:01:43.990
- Someone who adores your mother.

01:01:43.990 --> 01:01:45.010
How many letters are there?

01:01:45.010 --> 01:01:47.950
- Oh, dozens and dozens,
they're so saccharin,

01:01:47.950 --> 01:01:49.150
they make my teeth ache.

01:01:50.780 --> 01:01:51.613
- Are you okay?

01:01:53.241 --> 01:01:54.653
- I'm fine, splendid.

01:01:56.510 --> 01:01:58.590
- That's such a lie, you're crying.

01:01:58.590 --> 01:02:00.697
- Oh no, no, no, these are my allergies.

01:02:00.697 --> 01:02:02.563
- Allergies, what allergies.

01:02:03.622 --> 01:02:06.289
(phone ringing)

01:02:07.260 --> 01:02:10.673
- Hello, oh hello.

01:02:11.740 --> 01:02:16.740
Um, not much, just solving
the worlds hunger crisis

01:02:16.810 --> 01:02:18.210
and fighting global warming.

01:02:19.600 --> 01:02:24.533
Tonight, no, I'm booked up.

01:02:27.255 --> 01:02:32.255
Let me check, um, I'm sorry
that's tomorrow night,

01:02:33.090 --> 01:02:36.803
tonight I'm free, yes, yes, I can.

01:02:38.920 --> 01:02:40.203
I'll see you there.

01:02:41.430 --> 01:02:42.500
- Who was that?

01:02:42.500 --> 01:02:45.900
- Oh, what's his name, the detective.

01:02:45.900 --> 01:02:46.850
- Jilson?

01:02:46.850 --> 01:02:49.270
- No, no the other one, Eddie.

01:02:49.270 --> 01:02:50.370
- Eddie asked you out.

01:02:51.300 --> 01:02:53.220
- For a talk and a drink.

01:02:53.220 --> 01:02:55.651
- Oh so this is why
it's like a date right.

01:02:55.651 --> 01:02:58.509
- No, no this is not a date.

01:02:58.509 --> 01:03:02.270
- A drink and a talk, hello
that is totally a date.

01:03:02.270 --> 01:03:03.983
- He's a bloody detective Nigel.

01:03:05.558 --> 01:03:10.558
(crickets chirping)
(owl hooting)

01:03:16.180 --> 01:03:17.740
Any luck?

01:03:17.740 --> 01:03:20.423
- I'll be in JR's computer
by the time you get back.

01:03:21.430 --> 01:03:25.140
Meanwhile, I managed to hack
into the County land records.

01:03:25.140 --> 01:03:28.280
Now except for Tassajaro,
every parcel of land

01:03:28.280 --> 01:03:31.283
on JR's map has been sold
in the last five years.

01:03:32.187 --> 01:03:34.196
- In the middle of
nowhere, who bought them?

01:03:34.196 --> 01:03:37.310
- A dozen different companies,
but it gets interesting.

01:03:37.310 --> 01:03:39.630
Every single one of them is owned by

01:03:39.630 --> 01:03:41.880
a company called JDT Enterprises,

01:03:41.880 --> 01:03:44.260
incorporated in Gran Cayman's.

01:03:44.260 --> 01:03:46.510
- Sounds like some sort of shell company.

01:03:46.510 --> 01:03:48.063
- Aren't they all in the Cayman's.

01:03:49.460 --> 01:03:51.660
- See what you can find out about JDT.

01:03:51.660 --> 01:03:52.710
- I am already on it.

01:03:53.570 --> 01:03:54.660
- I've got to run.

01:03:54.660 --> 01:03:58.320
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
you can't go out like that.

01:03:59.490 --> 01:04:01.660
- The outfit, too dressy.

01:04:01.660 --> 01:04:04.313
- The eyes, they're too red, too puffy.

01:04:08.750 --> 01:04:11.470
- Oh God you're right, how horrible.

01:04:11.470 --> 01:04:13.820
What have you got for the lizard eyes?

01:04:13.820 --> 01:04:18.130
- Cold teaspoons, slices
of cucumbers, wet teabags.

01:04:18.130 --> 01:04:20.953
- All the old standards,
not a good look at a bar.

01:04:22.097 --> 01:04:23.643
Have you got something a bit more subtle?

01:04:25.090 --> 01:04:27.483
- You want subtle, I have got subtle.

01:04:28.610 --> 01:04:32.320
Here rub some of this on
your eyes, repeat as needed.

01:04:32.320 --> 01:04:34.650
Don't get any on your lips.

01:04:34.650 --> 01:04:35.830
- What is this stuff?

01:04:35.830 --> 01:04:36.993
- It's hemorrhoid cream.

01:04:39.379 --> 01:04:42.629
(romantic piano music)

01:05:24.649 --> 01:05:27.649
(audience applauds)

01:05:34.314 --> 01:05:36.690
- You're early, I wanted to finish my set

01:05:36.690 --> 01:05:38.240
before you got here.

01:05:38.240 --> 01:05:40.063
- I didn't know what
traffic would be like.

01:05:40.063 --> 01:05:42.710
- Good call, moose in
the middle of the road

01:05:42.710 --> 01:05:44.050
would hold up traffic for hours.

01:05:44.050 --> 01:05:46.610
- Exactly what I was worried about.

01:05:46.610 --> 01:05:48.943
- Look just so you know,
I tracked down the hikers

01:05:48.943 --> 01:05:50.980
that found JR's body.

01:05:50.980 --> 01:05:51.813
- Really?

01:05:51.813 --> 01:05:54.370
- They saw an old truck on
the bluff where JR jumped.

01:05:55.800 --> 01:05:56.633
- Allegedly.

01:05:59.460 --> 01:06:03.000
- They also saw a guy
walking to the truck,

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:04.590
he had a limp.

01:06:04.590 --> 01:06:05.840
- Told you.

01:06:05.840 --> 01:06:06.993
- Yes, you did.

01:06:08.890 --> 01:06:10.380
Hot sauce for silverware.

01:06:10.380 --> 01:06:12.623
- Hmm, takes the tarnish out.

01:06:16.084 --> 01:06:16.917
- Do you have a solution
for every single problem?

01:06:21.980 --> 01:06:24.093
- Well there are a few
I haven't figured out.

01:06:27.250 --> 01:06:29.700
Why did you want to finish
the set before I came?

01:06:31.600 --> 01:06:33.890
- I didn't think you'd be into jazz.

01:06:33.890 --> 01:06:37.040
- Well frankly, I never have been before,

01:06:37.040 --> 01:06:38.390
tonight was the first time.

01:06:39.430 --> 01:06:40.263
- Why tonight?

01:06:41.883 --> 01:06:43.253
- I like watching you play,

01:06:45.090 --> 01:06:48.503
and you looked like you were
totally absorbed in the music.

01:06:53.300 --> 01:06:54.850
I can see why people like jazz.

01:06:57.250 --> 01:06:58.687
- Well it sneaks up on yah.

01:06:59.957 --> 01:07:04.393
Before you realize it's
happening, it's got yah.

01:07:07.467 --> 01:07:10.800
(gentle romantic music)

01:07:16.417 --> 01:07:18.250
- I see what you mean.

01:07:28.483 --> 01:07:30.033
- Maybe I better finish my set.

01:07:34.590 --> 01:07:36.240
Want to stick around for a while?

01:07:37.251 --> 01:07:39.501
- Why not, I'm on vacation.

01:07:43.479 --> 01:07:48.479
(crickets chirping)
(wolf howling)

01:07:50.329 --> 01:07:53.148
(trash cans rattling outside)

01:07:53.148 --> 01:07:56.398
(light dramatic music)

01:08:03.935 --> 01:08:08.268
(slippers squeaking as Nigel walks)

01:08:10.379 --> 01:08:14.212
(trash cans rattling outside)

01:08:29.214 --> 01:08:34.214
(door knob rattling)
(Nigel gasps)

01:09:04.569 --> 01:09:07.210
(Nigel screams)

01:09:07.210 --> 01:09:08.160
What are you doing?

01:09:09.332 --> 01:09:12.557
- There was, there was
someone outside on the deck,

01:09:12.557 --> 01:09:14.710
tell me it was you please, please.

01:09:14.710 --> 01:09:15.609
- I just got here.

01:09:16.620 --> 01:09:19.149
- It was the guy from the
motel, he's trying to kill us,

01:09:19.149 --> 01:09:22.819
again, why you know, what
have we ever done to him.

01:09:22.819 --> 01:09:24.750
You know, we don't even know him.

01:09:24.750 --> 01:09:26.029
How does he know about us, you know,

01:09:26.029 --> 01:09:28.430
I mean who are we, you know,

01:09:28.430 --> 01:09:30.279
we're just two nosy
people that should just

01:09:30.279 --> 01:09:32.124
mind their own business and this,

01:09:32.124 --> 01:09:34.701
I can't, I can't die yet, you know,

01:09:34.701 --> 01:09:37.800
I haven't even lived, I
want to fly like an eagle.

01:09:37.800 --> 01:09:38.633
Did you see anything?

01:09:38.633 --> 01:09:41.350
- Yes, he's still out
there, it's frightening.

01:09:41.350 --> 01:09:42.220
- What's he doing?

01:09:42.220 --> 01:09:44.649
- He's going through the garbage.

01:09:44.649 --> 01:09:46.000
- Why?

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:49.100
- It's a raccoon, looking
for a midnight snack.

01:09:49.100 --> 01:09:51.009
Did I hear you say fly like an eagle?

01:09:51.009 --> 01:09:52.720
- I'm a huge Steve Miller fan.

01:09:52.720 --> 01:09:54.570
- Oh yes, of course you are.

01:09:54.570 --> 01:09:56.420
Any luck with the computer?

01:09:56.420 --> 01:10:00.453
- Oh yeah, of course,
that's not the problem.

01:10:01.390 --> 01:10:02.990
Each one of the files is encrypted.

01:10:02.990 --> 01:10:04.490
- Which means?

01:10:04.490 --> 01:10:05.323
- It won't be easy.

01:10:05.323 --> 01:10:07.520
- Damn.
- However,

01:10:07.520 --> 01:10:10.940
one of the biggest files was labeled JDT.

01:10:10.940 --> 01:10:13.600
- The company that bought
the land around Tassajaro.

01:10:13.600 --> 01:10:17.120
- With an office in town,
and yes I have an address.

01:10:17.120 --> 01:10:19.600
2020, Bison Boulevard.

01:10:19.600 --> 01:10:21.353
Bison Boulevard, only in Wyoming.

01:10:23.490 --> 01:10:25.558
- You're brilliant.

01:10:25.558 --> 01:10:26.640
First thing in the morning we'll go

01:10:26.640 --> 01:10:28.620
and check out that office.

01:10:28.620 --> 01:10:31.993
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
did you lock the door?

01:10:37.473 --> 01:10:39.525
(key clicks in the lock)

01:10:39.525 --> 01:10:40.358
- There.

01:10:41.264 --> 01:10:44.395
Do you want me to tuck you in too.

01:10:44.395 --> 01:10:47.839
(Nigel chuckles nervously)

01:10:47.839 --> 01:10:50.839
(suspenseful music)

01:11:00.483 --> 01:11:02.680
- Door to door, 17 minutes.

01:11:02.680 --> 01:11:03.770
- Oh my God.

01:11:03.770 --> 01:11:05.182
- I'm very good with directions.

01:11:05.182 --> 01:11:06.580
- Not you Nigel, that blue truck.

01:11:06.580 --> 01:11:08.630
It's the same truck I
saw outside the motel,

01:11:08.630 --> 01:11:10.164
I'm sure of it.

01:11:10.164 --> 01:11:12.010
- You know what, I think I did too.

01:11:12.010 --> 01:11:14.880
- Eddie told me the hikers
that found JR at Diablo Canyon,

01:11:14.880 --> 01:11:18.200
saw a truck parked there,
the driver had a limp.

01:11:18.200 --> 01:11:20.663
- The killers here, at JDT, why?

01:11:22.140 --> 01:11:23.633
- That's what I'd like to know.

01:11:55.600 --> 01:11:57.620
We need to see what's
going on inside there.

01:11:57.620 --> 01:11:59.920
- Are you crazy, he tried to kill us.

01:11:59.920 --> 01:12:01.850
He obviously knows what
Prudence McCoy looks like.

01:12:01.850 --> 01:12:04.250
- Maybe we can see something
inside one of those windows.

01:12:04.250 --> 01:12:07.810
- Bad idea, one more move and
we will be eating hot lead.

01:12:07.810 --> 01:12:08.790
- Eating hot lead?

01:12:09.920 --> 01:12:14.270
- Whatever, look, look, you
can't do this, I'll go in.

01:12:14.270 --> 01:12:16.670
- You?
- Yeah, me.

01:12:16.670 --> 01:12:19.270
When I'm with you, no one
ever pays any attention to me,

01:12:19.270 --> 01:12:20.520
he'll never recognize me.

01:12:22.940 --> 01:12:26.513
- Well, if you see anything
interesting, record it.

01:12:28.090 --> 01:12:30.095
You're very brave Nigel.

01:12:30.095 --> 01:12:32.993
- (chuckles) Brave, I'm
so scared I could vomit.

01:12:34.460 --> 01:12:36.570
- Well just to be on the safe side

01:12:36.570 --> 01:12:39.170
we need to get you a cover of some kind.

01:12:39.170 --> 01:12:42.215
- You're right a cover,
what kind of cover?

01:12:42.215 --> 01:12:45.298
(light bouncy music)

01:13:01.450 --> 01:13:02.300
- May I help you?

01:13:05.222 --> 01:13:07.639
- Oh, I'm delivering flowers.

01:13:09.460 --> 01:13:12.963
- I can see that, they're
awesome, who are they for?

01:13:13.970 --> 01:13:15.350
- Who are they for?

01:13:15.350 --> 01:13:19.890
That's a good question, who
do you think they're for?

01:13:19.890 --> 01:13:22.403
- Oh my gosh, he remembered my birthday.

01:13:23.330 --> 01:13:25.140
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, he
did, he did remember.

01:13:25.140 --> 01:13:28.140
- He totally acted like
he forgot this morning.

01:13:28.140 --> 01:13:29.787
- No, no, no, no, no,
no, he just you know,

01:13:29.787 --> 01:13:31.383
he wanted to surprise you.

01:13:32.700 --> 01:13:36.210
- He did, is there a card?

01:13:36.210 --> 01:13:38.750
- No, no, there's no card, none, notta,

01:13:38.750 --> 01:13:42.550
he said that he wants
to tell you in person.

01:13:42.550 --> 01:13:44.010
- He is so sweet.

01:13:44.010 --> 01:13:46.030
- Isn't he, totally.

01:13:46.030 --> 01:13:48.330
- Just, just a second
okay, don't go anywhere.

01:13:51.313 --> 01:13:53.980
(phone ringing)

01:13:57.788 --> 01:13:59.455
- They're beautiful.

01:14:01.539 --> 01:14:04.956
The flowers, would you stop, I'm serious.

01:14:06.097 --> 01:14:09.430
(muffled conversations)

01:14:28.150 --> 01:14:29.930
He so funny, he kept pretending

01:14:29.930 --> 01:14:31.587
like he didn't send anything.

01:14:31.587 --> 01:14:32.420
- (chuckles) Really.

01:14:32.420 --> 01:14:33.710
- But I so knew it was him.

01:14:33.710 --> 01:14:36.150
I hate it when he teases me like that,

01:14:36.150 --> 01:14:37.193
he's such a brat.

01:14:38.340 --> 01:14:41.973
- But a sweet brat, happy Birthday.

01:14:43.110 --> 01:14:45.643
- Wait, wait, wait, where are you going.

01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:04.833
You're hot.

01:15:06.220 --> 01:15:07.370
- I am?

01:15:07.370 --> 01:15:10.710
- Totally, call me,
maybe you could help me

01:15:10.710 --> 01:15:12.160
blow out my Birthday candles.

01:15:13.010 --> 01:15:15.830
- But what about the brat
that sent you the flowers?

01:15:15.830 --> 01:15:17.553
- My dad, what about him?

01:15:27.327 --> 01:15:30.410
(light bouncy music)

01:15:38.231 --> 01:15:40.645
- Well did you get anything?

01:15:40.645 --> 01:15:43.887
- I got a tip and a phone number.

01:15:43.887 --> 01:15:45.633
- I mean did you see anything?

01:15:49.512 --> 01:15:52.679
(car engine rumbling)

01:15:59.610 --> 01:16:00.820
That map on the wall, that's the same one

01:16:00.820 --> 01:16:01.800
JR had isn't it?

01:16:01.800 --> 01:16:03.350
- Yeah, I think it is.

01:16:03.350 --> 01:16:04.840
- [Male] They aren't dead.

01:16:04.840 --> 01:16:06.020
- [Male] That happens sometimes.

01:16:06.020 --> 01:16:07.346
- And there's that limper.

01:16:07.346 --> 01:16:09.309
Who's this other guy?

01:16:09.309 --> 01:16:10.890
- [Male] You're supposed to be the best.

01:16:10.890 --> 01:16:12.550
- [Male] I am.

01:16:12.550 --> 01:16:13.570
- [Male] You're wasting my time.

01:16:13.570 --> 01:16:15.080
- [Male] I'm paying for your time.

01:16:15.080 --> 01:16:16.960
- No way, turn around (gasps),

01:16:22.165 --> 01:16:24.915
Nigel it's Jean Philippe Andrews.

01:16:29.090 --> 01:16:31.463
I can't believe you two can
eat at a time like this.

01:16:31.463 --> 01:16:34.215
- This is lunch, this
is not a time like this,

01:16:34.215 --> 01:16:35.048
whatever that means.

01:16:35.048 --> 01:16:37.010
- What it means is we
know who's doing what,

01:16:37.010 --> 01:16:40.420
we know why, we have a
victim, we have a videotape.

01:16:40.420 --> 01:16:43.310
- And as I said before, we
can't prove anything, not yet.

01:16:43.310 --> 01:16:45.920
- There must be something we can do.

01:16:45.920 --> 01:16:47.990
- We can question the shooter,

01:16:47.990 --> 01:16:50.330
but if he's a pro he won't crack,

01:16:50.330 --> 01:16:52.440
and besides he's just a hired gun.

01:16:52.440 --> 01:16:54.040
- Why don't we go after Andrews?

01:16:55.480 --> 01:16:57.860
- What's his motive, he owns Tassajaro,

01:16:57.860 --> 01:16:59.337
he can do anything on
that land he wants to do

01:16:59.337 --> 01:17:02.513
that's not illegal,
including drilling for oil.

01:17:03.800 --> 01:17:07.930
- Why have JR killed, it makes no sense.

01:17:07.930 --> 01:17:08.763
The worse thing he could have done

01:17:08.763 --> 01:17:10.433
is write an embarrassing expose.

01:17:12.010 --> 01:17:14.110
- The Andrews name means a lot round here,

01:17:15.150 --> 01:17:19.003
maybe Jean Philippe just felt
he couldn't afford an expose.

01:17:21.580 --> 01:17:23.363
What can I say, people are weird.

01:17:24.330 --> 01:17:25.930
- Now we're missing something,

01:17:25.930 --> 01:17:28.283
there's a piece of the
puzzle we haven't found.

01:17:31.550 --> 01:17:33.300
- You haven't said a word, not one.

01:17:35.280 --> 01:17:37.530
I hate it when you're not talking,

01:17:37.530 --> 01:17:39.710
it means you're thinking,
which is never good

01:17:39.710 --> 01:17:41.470
because if you don't
figure out whatever it is

01:17:41.470 --> 01:17:42.970
you're trying to figure out then you just

01:17:42.970 --> 01:17:45.554
start obsessing and festering you know,

01:17:45.554 --> 01:17:48.230
and then the pressure, it
just builds and builds,

01:17:48.230 --> 01:17:52.040
and builds and builds and
then kaboom, you know.

01:17:52.040 --> 01:17:54.110
You're like Mount Vesuvius erupting

01:17:54.110 --> 01:17:56.482
and then blowing hot ash
and rock miles into the air

01:17:56.482 --> 01:17:58.620
and burying thousands of innocent people

01:17:58.620 --> 01:18:01.150
in your molten lava, like me for instance.

01:18:01.150 --> 01:18:02.827
- Nigel, if you keep distracting me

01:18:02.827 --> 01:18:04.673
I'm going to sew your lips together.

01:18:05.710 --> 01:18:08.660
- It could be 100 million
dollars, this isn't about money.

01:18:08.660 --> 01:18:11.783
Jean Philippe has broken
his families sacred oath.

01:18:12.800 --> 01:18:14.863
Start calling, the ceremonies tomorrow.

01:18:16.580 --> 01:18:19.350
- What's wrong, what's
Jean Philippe doing?

01:18:19.350 --> 01:18:21.910
- His office sent this
letter out to all the elders,

01:18:21.910 --> 01:18:23.343
he's selling Tassajaro.

01:18:25.542 --> 01:18:26.375
- To JDT.

01:18:27.500 --> 01:18:30.400
- But he is JDT, that
doesn't make any sense.

01:18:30.400 --> 01:18:33.130
- Why sell it, he should
give that land to us,

01:18:33.130 --> 01:18:35.373
that's what Bart had
always intended to do.

01:18:38.250 --> 01:18:41.610
- Until he found Jean
Philippe, his only heir.

01:18:44.160 --> 01:18:45.363
The missing piece Nigel.

01:18:47.752 --> 01:18:51.100
(phone dialing)

01:18:51.100 --> 01:18:56.100
Francoise, it's Prudence, that
document that I faxed to you,

01:18:57.349 --> 01:18:59.747
I need to know what it says right now.

01:19:01.857 --> 01:19:05.070
- Ladies and gentlemen,
thank you so much for coming.

01:19:05.070 --> 01:19:07.660
I'm Jean Philippe Andrews,
I've invited you here today

01:19:07.660 --> 01:19:10.610
to remember my father Harvey Andrews,

01:19:10.610 --> 01:19:12.893
and to celebrate the future of Tassajaro,

01:19:13.770 --> 01:19:15.950
a future that my father and generations

01:19:15.950 --> 01:19:18.310
of the Andrews family would embrace.

01:19:18.310 --> 01:19:21.790
Over the past 160 years,
the Andrews family has

01:19:21.790 --> 01:19:23.959
protected and preserved Tassajaro --

01:19:23.959 --> 01:19:28.959
(Jean Philippe continues
speaking in the distance)

01:19:32.573 --> 01:19:33.863
- I'll be right there.

01:19:41.592 --> 01:19:44.675
(knocking on window)

01:19:45.723 --> 01:19:48.020
- Yeah, I'll call you back.

01:19:48.020 --> 01:19:50.080
Well well, what a pleasant surprise.

01:19:50.080 --> 01:19:52.739
- Oh I'm sure it's a surprise
but it won't be pleasant.

01:19:52.739 --> 01:19:54.410
- Why what's happened?

01:19:54.410 --> 01:19:56.480
- Bart Andrews son died in the same crash

01:19:56.480 --> 01:19:58.250
that killed his mother.

01:19:58.250 --> 01:19:59.420
- What are you talking about?

01:19:59.420 --> 01:20:00.671
- Of course you learnt about this

01:20:00.671 --> 01:20:02.490
when you heard about Jean Vieve,

01:20:02.490 --> 01:20:04.750
but you didn't tell Bart
that when he sent you

01:20:04.750 --> 01:20:06.710
to try and find his son, did you?

01:20:06.710 --> 01:20:07.960
- That's ridiculous.

01:20:07.960 --> 01:20:10.768
- Is it, Bart was dying,

01:20:10.768 --> 01:20:11.810
and you weren't a member of the family,

01:20:11.810 --> 01:20:13.527
so you weren't going to get a penny.

01:20:13.527 --> 01:20:16.540
So you found a boy the same
age as Jean Philippe in France,

01:20:16.540 --> 01:20:19.220
you made a deal with him, and
you created a son for Bart

01:20:19.220 --> 01:20:21.918
that would be your key
to the family fortune.

01:20:21.918 --> 01:20:24.600
- You know what this is
Prudence, it's a sick fantasy.

01:20:24.600 --> 01:20:25.970
You need professional help.

01:20:25.970 --> 01:20:27.630
- Actually you're the one that needs help,

01:20:27.630 --> 01:20:31.023
a good defense lawyer,
and it's not a fantasy.

01:20:33.730 --> 01:20:34.853
It's the real thing.

01:20:37.566 --> 01:20:40.018
- How much do you want for it?

01:20:40.018 --> 01:20:42.553
- Er, how does a billion dollars sound?

01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:47.160
- Something tells me they're not gonna

01:20:47.160 --> 01:20:49.123
accept that offer Prudence.

01:20:51.017 --> 01:20:52.270
- Don't be stupid Doug, you really think

01:20:52.270 --> 01:20:54.320
we didn't tell the police
everything we know.

01:20:54.320 --> 01:20:55.290
- Oh, I know you didn't,

01:20:55.290 --> 01:20:57.443
otherwise they'd be
here instead of you two.

01:20:58.478 --> 01:21:00.395
- Freeze, drop the gun.

01:21:02.423 --> 01:21:03.473
Don't think, drop it.

01:21:06.070 --> 01:21:07.870
Hands behind your head, both of yah.

01:21:09.633 --> 01:21:10.763
Drop to your knees.

01:21:14.930 --> 01:21:15.830
Cross your ankles.

01:21:16.726 --> 01:21:18.586
(police siren wailing)

01:21:18.586 --> 01:21:20.030
- On behalf of the Andrews family

01:21:20.030 --> 01:21:21.930
I'm pleased to announce
that every penny of this

01:21:21.930 --> 01:21:23.780
five million dollars will be donated

01:21:23.780 --> 01:21:25.500
to the Native American Tribal Council.

01:21:25.500 --> 01:21:28.440
- We don't want money, you
won't destroy our history

01:21:28.440 --> 01:21:29.290
and heritage.

01:21:29.290 --> 01:21:31.710
- I assure you we're
not destroying anything.

01:21:31.710 --> 01:21:33.740
We're transferring
stewardship to a company

01:21:33.740 --> 01:21:36.450
that will continue the
tradition of my family.

01:21:36.450 --> 01:21:38.450
- You said your family.

01:21:38.450 --> 01:21:40.030
- Yes, we've owned this land since 140 --

01:21:40.030 --> 01:21:42.482
- No the Andrews have owned this land,

01:21:42.482 --> 01:21:44.649
and you're not a member of that family,

01:21:44.649 --> 01:21:48.820
you're a pretender, a liar and a fraud.

01:21:48.820 --> 01:21:51.160
Not only that he's
planning to drill for oil

01:21:51.160 --> 01:21:54.913
under Tassajaro, and
desecrate this sacred ground.

01:21:54.913 --> 01:21:55.746
- What do you think you're doing?

01:21:55.746 --> 01:21:57.430
- Yanking your cover.

01:21:57.430 --> 01:21:59.630
- Can we have security
up here please right now.

01:21:59.630 --> 01:22:01.973
- It's not necessary the
police are already here.

01:22:04.630 --> 01:22:08.100
This is a French death certificate,

01:22:08.100 --> 01:22:10.900
that's proof that Bart Andrews
son died three years ago

01:22:10.900 --> 01:22:15.900
in Paris, whoever he is,
he's not Bart's heir.

01:22:17.750 --> 01:22:20.570
He doesn't own Tassajaro,
and he's not selling anything

01:22:20.570 --> 01:22:21.403
but a lie.

01:22:22.979 --> 01:22:26.646
(crowd cheers and applauds)

01:22:30.435 --> 01:22:33.518
(light bright music)

01:22:37.170 --> 01:22:39.400
Jeffery it's Prudence.

01:22:39.400 --> 01:22:40.850
- [Jeffrey] How was your vacation?

01:22:40.850 --> 01:22:42.403
- Perfect, just what I needed.

01:22:43.410 --> 01:22:45.460
But that's not why I'm calling.

01:22:45.460 --> 01:22:47.323
- [Jeffrey] Is anything wrong?

01:22:47.323 --> 01:22:49.363
Please don't tell me you've been arrested.

01:22:49.363 --> 01:22:51.660
- Who was my mothers lover?

01:22:51.660 --> 01:22:53.590
- [Jeffrey] Oh you've read the letters.

01:22:53.590 --> 01:22:54.830
- You knew about those.

01:22:54.830 --> 01:22:56.820
- I've known about them for years,

01:22:56.820 --> 01:22:58.927
I asked Ruth to give them to you.

01:22:58.927 --> 01:23:00.050
- Why?

01:23:00.050 --> 01:23:02.610
- I wanted you to know how
much someone loved her,

01:23:02.610 --> 01:23:04.210
and how much she loved him back.

01:23:05.250 --> 01:23:09.090
- My God, Jeffrey you and my mother.

01:23:09.090 --> 01:23:11.283
- Were dear friends for 30 years,

01:23:12.220 --> 01:23:14.440
lovers after your father died.

01:23:14.440 --> 01:23:16.810
- Well why are you telling me this now?

01:23:16.810 --> 01:23:19.670
- Because I think you need
to know about this now.

01:23:19.670 --> 01:23:20.970
- About you and my mother.

01:23:21.900 --> 01:23:24.800
- No, about your mother,
she waited too long

01:23:24.800 --> 01:23:27.170
to start living the life that she wanted.

01:23:27.170 --> 01:23:29.433
I know she wouldn't want you
to make the same mistake.

01:23:31.920 --> 01:23:36.030
- Um, I've got to go, when
I get back to New York,

01:23:36.030 --> 01:23:37.480
we've got to talk.

01:23:37.480 --> 01:23:38.491
- Of course.

01:23:38.491 --> 01:23:41.574
(motorcycle roaring)

01:23:53.773 --> 01:23:55.993
- Cool motorcycle, thanks for the ride.

01:23:57.040 --> 01:23:59.610
- Take a cab next time,
hitch hiking is dangerous.

01:23:59.610 --> 01:24:03.523
- I know, I just wanted to
get here, like really quickly.

01:24:05.060 --> 01:24:06.790
Is Nigel here?

01:24:06.790 --> 01:24:08.670
- He's been up since dawn getting ready.

01:24:08.670 --> 01:24:09.870
- Oh he has not.

01:24:09.870 --> 01:24:11.680
- Oh yes he has, trust me.

01:24:11.680 --> 01:24:14.350
- (laughs) Oh my God, he's so adorable.

01:24:14.350 --> 01:24:16.420
- Well whatever threads
your needle sweetie,

01:24:16.420 --> 01:24:18.760
he's in the house, you'll probably have to

01:24:18.760 --> 01:24:20.110
scrape him off the ceiling.

01:24:20.110 --> 01:24:21.513
- Ooh, yummy.

01:24:27.150 --> 01:24:30.784
- I'm glad you called, surprised but glad.

01:24:30.784 --> 01:24:32.090
- Me too.

01:24:32.090 --> 01:24:33.780
- Surprised or glad?

01:24:33.780 --> 01:24:35.051
- Both.

01:24:35.051 --> 01:24:36.939
- You sure you're ready for this?

01:24:36.939 --> 01:24:39.533
- Well I'm not sure but I am ready.

01:24:43.936 --> 01:24:45.300
- Your first time right?

01:24:45.300 --> 01:24:48.133
- My first time, be gentle.

01:24:48.133 --> 01:24:50.183
- It's my middle name, hold on.

01:24:51.786 --> 01:24:53.583
- To what, where are the handles?

01:24:53.583 --> 01:24:55.083
- I'm the handles.

01:24:58.587 --> 01:24:59.420
Tighter.

01:25:02.376 --> 01:25:05.315
(motorcycle engine roaring)

01:25:05.315 --> 01:25:08.648
(bright cheerful music)

01:26:19.399 --> 01:26:22.649
(electronic whooshing)
