WEBVTT

00:01.919 --> 00:04.078
* Doo wah, doo wah *

00:04.080 --> 00:06.400
* Doo wah, doo wah... *

00:06.401 --> 00:07.881
Oh, God.

00:10.294 --> 00:12.127
- Tom.
- What are you doing?

00:12.128 --> 00:14.015
Pretending to help by
standing in various parts

00:14.016 --> 00:15.570
of the house, but you're not
actually doing anything.

00:15.571 --> 00:18.205
- I just saw Arnold pack his guitar.
- Oh, no.

00:18.206 --> 00:22.686
Uber is not my fault!

00:22.687 --> 00:24.687
- Happy birthday!
- Sorry I'm late.

00:24.688 --> 00:26.117
Someone called me fat in Year 3.

00:26.118 --> 00:29.169
Look what we did to the van! Oh.

00:30.450 --> 00:33.451
That's great. Great.

00:34.891 --> 00:37.732
* One, two One, two, three, four *

00:37.733 --> 00:39.412
* Ooh *

00:39.413 --> 00:42.694
- * Yeah, I'll be fine, yeah, yeah *
- * Ooh *

00:42.695 --> 00:45.695
- * Ooh *
- * Okay *

00:45.696 --> 00:48.092
- * Ooh *
- * Oh, the good Lord knows it *

00:48.093 --> 00:50.778
- * Ooh *
- * Oh, the good Lord knows it *

00:50.779 --> 00:53.018
- * Ooh *
- * I left better behind *

00:53.019 --> 00:56.696
* I'll be fine, yeah, yeah, yeah *

00:56.697 --> 00:59.701
* Make my mamma turn another blind eye *

00:59.702 --> 01:01.781
* Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah *

01:01.782 --> 01:04.504
* I left better behind I'll be fine... *

01:08.144 --> 01:09.744
Maybe we should call my mum.

01:10.534 --> 01:12.785
She'll still be pretending to be asleep.

01:12.786 --> 01:15.426
This is Rose. I can't come
to the phone right now.

01:15.427 --> 01:17.668
Please leave your message and
then press the, uh, hash key.

01:17.669 --> 01:19.228
Hi, Ma!

01:19.229 --> 01:22.110
Uh, we're just on our way
camping for Hannah's birthday.

01:22.111 --> 01:25.550
I would put her on, but she
is having too much fun.

01:25.551 --> 01:28.392
- Isn't that right, Hannah?
- Mm, fun.

01:28.393 --> 01:32.193
Uh, what else? Arnold's
here. Just miserable.

01:32.194 --> 01:33.674
- I'm not miserable.
- Just miserable.

01:33.675 --> 01:36.315
He just will not stop talking about
how much weight you've put on.

01:36.316 --> 01:38.355
- Not this again.
- Not in a mean way.

01:38.356 --> 01:40.309
In, like, a nice way. Like, he likes it.

01:40.310 --> 01:43.557
Mmm! Mm, delicious. Here,
I'll let him explain.

01:43.558 --> 01:45.479
Sorry. Hi, Rose.

01:45.480 --> 01:47.239
I don't have any opinions
about your figure.

01:47.240 --> 01:48.719
I think we both know this.

01:48.720 --> 01:50.640
Just give her a compliment.
She needs your support.

01:50.641 --> 01:53.921
You're very independent.
Like a Destiny's Child.

01:53.922 --> 01:55.402
I mean, that's a lie.

01:55.403 --> 01:57.283
Obviously that's a weird
lie that he's told me,

01:57.284 --> 01:59.204
because you are very needy.

01:59.205 --> 02:00.724
What else is happening?

02:00.725 --> 02:03.685
Ella's here. She's driving the
van 'cause she's a feminist.

02:03.686 --> 02:05.886
Hi, Rose! We wish you were here!

02:05.887 --> 02:08.126
Maybe you should drive
down when you wake up!

02:08.127 --> 02:10.928
Hmm... Uh, Tom's... Is
Tom wearing headphones?

02:10.929 --> 02:12.688
What a creep.

02:12.689 --> 02:14.930
Every time I think I can't
be more surprised by him,

02:14.931 --> 02:16.606
he goes and does something more weird.

02:16.607 --> 02:19.109
Arnold, maybe you can pretend to be Tom.

02:19.452 --> 02:21.052
Hi. I'm Tom.

02:21.053 --> 02:24.293
I think I'm interesting, but
actually I just have a beard.

02:24.294 --> 02:26.894
I don't call my dad enough.

02:26.895 --> 02:28.735
- What?
- Nothing, Tom.

02:28.736 --> 02:33.217
Uh, and... now I guess
we'll sing you a song.

02:33.218 --> 02:34.697
Um...

02:34.698 --> 02:39.539
* It's Friday, Friday,
gotta get down on Friday *

02:39.540 --> 02:43.140
* Everybody's looking
forward to the weekend *

02:43.141 --> 02:45.301
* Friday, Friday *

02:45.302 --> 02:47.582
* Gotta get down on Friday *

02:47.583 --> 02:51.704
* Everybody's looking forward
to the weekend, weekend *

02:51.705 --> 02:53.904
* Friday, Friday *

02:53.905 --> 02:56.386
* Gotta get down on Friday *

02:56.387 --> 03:00.347
* Everybody's looking
forward to the weekend *

03:00.348 --> 03:02.588
* Partyin', partyin', yeah! *

03:02.589 --> 03:04.549
* Partyin', partyin', yeah! *

03:04.550 --> 03:06.789
* Fun, fun, fun, fun *

03:06.790 --> 03:08.963
* Looking forward to the weekend *

03:08.964 --> 03:10.231
Um, babe, I think...

03:10.232 --> 03:12.672
I think the poles might
go through these holes.

03:12.673 --> 03:14.554
- I've set it up before.
- Yeah.

03:15.594 --> 03:17.433
It's just that I think it might not work

03:17.434 --> 03:19.675
if you don't put the right
poles in the right holes.

03:19.676 --> 03:23.076
I used to be a Scout, remember?
You know, I did Scouts for a bit.

03:23.077 --> 03:25.477
- You weren't patrol leader, though.
- No.

03:25.478 --> 03:28.158
You were just a regular Scout,
just a junk Scout, like a peasant.

03:28.159 --> 03:29.758
- Yeah.
- Hey, Ella?

03:29.759 --> 03:31.109
Yes, Thomas?

03:31.110 --> 03:33.200
Did you get that washing
out of the machine?

03:33.201 --> 03:35.631
- No, I did not.
- Mm, good.

03:35.632 --> 03:37.802
- I was hoping you wouldn't do that.
- Yeah.

03:37.803 --> 03:40.162
Yeah, I thought, "Do you know
what would be less predictable

03:40.163 --> 03:42.004
"than doing the thing
I said I would do?"

03:42.005 --> 03:44.004
- Doing the opposite.
- Yep! Yep, the opposite.

03:44.005 --> 03:47.605
And I thought, "If we're lucky,
by the time we get home,

03:47.606 --> 03:49.326
"your clothes will be
completely ruined."

03:49.327 --> 03:51.847
Perfect, yeah. Do you
know what I didn't do?

03:51.848 --> 03:54.728
Um... get the bag with
all my special food in?

03:54.729 --> 03:56.529
Yeah, all the food for
your special diet.

03:56.530 --> 03:57.730
Good, good.

03:59.812 --> 04:02.651
I think maybe we'll try the
poles in the other holes.

04:02.652 --> 04:03.648
Yeah.

04:05.134 --> 04:07.493
Got nothing to say about
how wrong you were?

04:07.494 --> 04:08.304
No.

04:09.002 --> 04:12.455
Hey, guys! I've got a surprise.

04:12.456 --> 04:14.256
Oh, my God!

04:14.257 --> 04:17.656
She has fireworks! She has fireworks!

04:17.658 --> 04:20.058
- How long have you had those?
- Oh, not long.

04:20.059 --> 04:22.098
They've been illegal for eight years.

04:22.099 --> 04:23.780
Oh. A while.

04:23.781 --> 04:27.581
We absolutely cannot light
8-year-old fireworks.

04:27.582 --> 04:29.702
- We just definitely can't.
- Yes, we can!

04:29.703 --> 04:31.502
- Yes, we can.
- They might explode.

04:31.503 --> 04:34.282
- Yeah.
- No. No, sorry.

04:34.283 --> 04:35.782
We just can't.

04:37.903 --> 04:40.343
Fine, we won't light the
fucking fireworks, then!

04:40.344 --> 04:43.584
Just gonna go over there
and sit on a log.

04:43.585 --> 04:46.907
- You seem upset.
- You seem observant.

04:52.789 --> 04:54.828
Hannah, we should set up your tent.

04:54.829 --> 04:58.110
Yeah, bit of a problem there.
I did not pack a tent.

04:58.111 --> 05:01.551
- I thought I said to bring a tent.
- Oh, you definitely did.

05:01.552 --> 05:03.472
I just definitely forgot to pack a tent.

05:03.473 --> 05:05.840
- When did you realise this?
- When we got here.

05:06.554 --> 05:09.956
- What was your plan?
- I'm still working on it.

05:10.556 --> 05:11.979
Why didn't you say anything?

05:11.980 --> 05:14.053
Oh, my plans never involve chitchat.

05:14.599 --> 05:16.637
And you thought, maybe with
a bit of time and thinking,

05:16.638 --> 05:18.157
you could materialise a tent?

05:18.158 --> 05:20.853
Thought I could sleep under the van.

05:23.359 --> 05:25.800
You did bring a big bag
of old fireworks, though.

05:25.801 --> 05:27.361
Yep.

05:27.362 --> 05:30.802
- But not a tent.
- No tent, just fireworks.

05:30.803 --> 05:32.523
You can sleep with us, Hannah.

05:32.524 --> 05:34.244
Oh, thanks. That's very
kind of you, Arnold.

05:34.608 --> 05:36.689
Just heard that you guys weren't
very good at threesomes.

05:38.366 --> 05:41.527
Hannah, you can sleep on the floor
of the van, like a sleepover.

05:41.528 --> 05:44.808
- Tom, can we braid your hair?
- Yeah.

05:45.569 --> 05:49.049
I've decided the fireworks are safe
and fine and actually very thrilling.

05:49.050 --> 05:50.091
Yes!

05:50.092 --> 05:52.491
I think Tom should film them,
so if something does go wrong,

05:52.492 --> 05:53.972
we become viral internet sensations.

05:56.974 --> 05:59.373
Hey, guys, um,
I brought my guitar

05:59.374 --> 06:01.975
and I thought maybe I
could sing Hannah a song.

06:01.976 --> 06:03.616
Okay.

06:08.298 --> 06:11.059
* Shine bright like a diamond *

06:13.780 --> 06:18.140
* Shine bright like a diamond *

06:18.141 --> 06:21.262
* Find light in the beautiful sea *

06:21.263 --> 06:23.663
* I choose to be happy *

06:23.664 --> 06:26.224
* You and I... you and I *

06:26.225 --> 06:29.225
* We're like diamonds in the sky *

06:29.226 --> 06:31.386
* You're a shooting star I see *

06:31.387 --> 06:33.547
* A vision of ecstasy *

06:33.548 --> 06:36.467
* When you hold me I'm alive *

06:36.468 --> 06:39.069
* We're like diamonds in the sky *

06:39.070 --> 06:43.431
* I know that we become one *

06:43.432 --> 06:45.591
* Right away *

06:45.592 --> 06:48.833
* One right away *

06:48.834 --> 06:55.275
* At first I felt the
energy of sun rays *

06:55.276 --> 06:57.996
* Light inside your heart *

06:57.997 --> 06:59.876
Okay, so I've invented a game.

06:59.877 --> 07:01.918
- Ugh!
- 'Ugh'? Why 'ugh'?

07:01.919 --> 07:03.518
I don't know.

07:03.519 --> 07:05.799
You've just started going 'ugh'
at the end of my sentences.

07:05.800 --> 07:07.560
- It's become habit.
- I'm so sorry.

07:07.561 --> 07:10.401
So the game is called 'Let's
All Compliment Hannah'.

07:10.402 --> 07:12.122
Oh, I don't like this game.

07:12.123 --> 07:14.923
No, yes, but if we designed all
activities around what you liked,

07:14.924 --> 07:17.283
we'd be in your bed eating
savoury snacks, okay?

07:17.284 --> 07:19.685
Was that an option? Why wasn't
I told that was an option?

07:19.686 --> 07:23.567
So, we all compliment Hannah and then
Hannah has to give us an insult.

07:23.568 --> 07:25.207
Okay, then. Fine.

07:25.208 --> 07:27.047
Yes! I will go first.

07:27.048 --> 07:32.049
Hannah, I think you have Hollywood
cheekbones, like Eddie Redmayne,

07:32.050 --> 07:36.571
or Johnny Depp, or like a
woman, any woman also.

07:36.572 --> 07:38.572
- Cate Blanchett.
- Yes!

07:38.573 --> 07:40.692
Ooh, I'm so jealous of her cheekbones.

07:40.693 --> 07:43.934
Okay, so now, Hannah, you
have to insult Josh.

07:43.935 --> 07:46.736
Josh, you are a bully to Tom.

07:47.339 --> 07:48.976
Is that an insult? I don't
know if that's an insult.

07:48.977 --> 07:52.017
- Tom likes being bullied.
- No, I don't!

07:52.018 --> 07:55.258
Okay, well... well, this is shocking.

07:56.940 --> 07:59.940
But fine, yes, I guess
that's an insult. Arnold?

07:59.941 --> 08:04.142
Uh, Hannah, I think you are really
strong-minded and independent.

08:04.143 --> 08:06.143
That's nice rephrasing for 'lonely'.

08:06.144 --> 08:08.384
No, Hannah, you're not allowed
to insult yourself, okay?

08:08.385 --> 08:10.426
You're only allowed to insult Arnold.

08:10.427 --> 08:13.986
Pretty sure that's exactly the same
compliment you gave Josh's mum.

08:13.987 --> 08:16.708
Okay, Arnold, I preferred it when
you were more scared of the world.

08:16.709 --> 08:18.668
Hey, I'm still scared! I don't mean it.

08:18.669 --> 08:21.029
- I hate this game.
- Thomas, your turn.

08:21.030 --> 08:23.711
Hannah, I feel like you and
I have a lot in common.

08:23.712 --> 08:25.951
Ugh, I feel like that's
an insult for both of us.

08:25.952 --> 08:26.952
I agree.

08:26.953 --> 08:29.513
Tom, how could you in any way
think that's a compliment?

08:29.514 --> 08:31.073
Bully! Bully!

08:31.074 --> 08:35.115
Hannah, I think that you are
fantastic and hilarious,

08:35.116 --> 08:37.235
and I think you're a really
good friend to Rose,

08:37.236 --> 08:39.198
and you're beautiful.

08:40.357 --> 08:43.558
I think you say things you don't
mean to make people like you.

08:43.558 --> 08:47.601
That is such a good insult.

08:49.801 --> 08:51.867
Oh, my God, do you think someone died?

08:51.868 --> 08:54.082
- Like in that movie?
- Maybe someone drowned.

08:54.083 --> 08:56.363
- Well, that's our night ruined.
- Ooh, I wanna go see.

08:56.364 --> 08:59.644
No, no, let's not use a potentially
dead man as entertainment.

08:59.645 --> 09:01.365
No, let's not be those guys.

09:01.366 --> 09:03.839
If I was dead, I would absolutely
not care if someone looked at me.

09:04.576 --> 09:06.941
- Yeah, I'm gonna take a look.
- No!

09:06.942 --> 09:08.648
What if they need our help?

09:08.649 --> 09:10.649
How could they possibly need our help?

09:10.650 --> 09:12.489
What if they've been
stung by a jellyfish

09:12.490 --> 09:15.531
and they need someone to pee on
them and none of them need to go?

09:15.532 --> 09:17.629
Josh could do it. He
always needs to pee.

09:18.226 --> 09:20.533
See ya later, sucker.

09:21.992 --> 09:23.651
No. No, no, no.

09:23.652 --> 09:26.735
- I would quite like to go see.
- You don't need to go and see, Josh.

09:26.736 --> 09:28.856
You see, because, like,
everyone else is going to see

09:28.857 --> 09:30.536
and I also would like to go see.

09:30.537 --> 09:32.217
Okay, fine, you go. I'll wait here.

09:32.218 --> 09:35.138
Yes? Is this a trick?

09:35.139 --> 09:37.178
It's not a trick. Go.

09:37.179 --> 09:38.860
Promise I'm not going to get in trouble?

09:38.861 --> 09:40.900
I mean, it's just disgusting, isn't it?

09:40.901 --> 09:42.581
It's not a fun Friday night.

09:42.582 --> 09:45.062
Correct. Can't you just stay
here and feel superior?

09:45.063 --> 09:47.223
- I'm going back to the tent.
- What? What?

09:47.224 --> 09:49.264
No, fine. Okay, fine. I'll stay here.

09:49.265 --> 09:52.225
They can all go see and I'll stay
here with Arnold, in trouble, again.

09:52.226 --> 09:55.226
I mean, I don't know why you don't
care if I'm involved or not.

09:55.227 --> 09:56.787
No, that's not a thing.

09:56.788 --> 09:59.227
That's not a thing, me caring...
I wanted you to come, okay?

09:59.228 --> 10:02.309
That's a thing you invented in
your head and then got sad about.

10:02.310 --> 10:04.509
No, it's like the boat all over again.

10:04.510 --> 10:06.150
- It is not the boat!
- Yes, it is!

10:06.151 --> 10:08.551
What are you talking about? You
go on with this boat thing.

10:08.552 --> 10:10.031
It's deranged!

10:10.032 --> 10:11.872
Nah, it's just you and your dad

10:11.873 --> 10:16.594
taking a lovely little boat ride out
on the seas and leaving me behind.

10:16.595 --> 10:20.236
It's absolutely not my
fault you get seasick.

10:20.237 --> 10:23.156
- I do not get seasick.
- 100%!

10:23.157 --> 10:25.718
100% you said you get seasick.

10:25.719 --> 10:28.118
I don't even know why we're
talking about the boat again.

10:28.119 --> 10:31.200
Hey, but you brought it up.
It is the stupidest...

10:31.201 --> 10:33.921
This is the stupidest, the stupidest...

10:33.922 --> 10:35.441
Fuck, I just don't even know.

10:35.442 --> 10:38.003
I just think probably
that you just hate me.

10:38.004 --> 10:39.563
No, you hate me.

10:39.564 --> 10:42.204
It's just so clear, every time you
have, like, a couple of drinks

10:42.205 --> 10:43.685
that you just hate me

10:43.686 --> 10:45.725
and I wish you would
just break up with me

10:45.726 --> 10:47.447
so we didn't have to bother anymore.

10:47.448 --> 10:50.287
Fine. We're broken up, then. Done.

10:50.288 --> 10:53.610
- Yeah? We're single?
- Yeah, single, ready to mingle.

10:56.306 --> 10:57.730
How was it?

10:57.731 --> 11:00.331
- I want to go back to the camp site.
- Why?

11:00.332 --> 11:04.212
Yeah, it was, um... it was pretty bad.

11:04.213 --> 11:07.694
The, um, policeman asked
us if we knew him,

11:07.695 --> 11:10.174
and when we said no,

11:10.175 --> 11:13.176
he asked us why we were there
and none of us could answer.

11:13.177 --> 11:15.817
- Him?
- The body.

11:15.818 --> 11:17.578
Oh.

11:17.579 --> 11:20.579
They kept trying to shut his
eyes but they wouldn't close.

11:20.580 --> 11:23.020
Just kept bouncing back open.

11:23.021 --> 11:27.341
He had a tattoo of a child on his body.

11:27.342 --> 11:28.863
Probably his child, I reckon.

11:28.864 --> 11:30.176
Jesus Christ.

11:30.177 --> 11:33.063
We just looked like the worst people.

11:33.064 --> 11:35.698
Arnold, you were absolutely right.

11:36.332 --> 11:40.027
Nuh, I've seen worse. This
guy still had a face.

11:40.816 --> 11:42.227
I feel a bit sick.

11:44.000 --> 11:50.074

12:09.279 --> 12:11.279
I'm sorry about last night.

12:11.280 --> 12:13.319
It's just sometimes when you're drunk

12:13.320 --> 12:16.001
it's fun to pretend to be
single for 20 minutes,

12:16.002 --> 12:19.361
but then you hate it and I'm sorry
and let's never fight again.

13:14.984 --> 13:17.105
Silly string fight!

13:19.906 --> 13:21.826
Fuck!

13:21.827 --> 13:24.186
Fuck! Fuck!

13:24.187 --> 13:27.028
I think I'm bleeding.

13:28.140 --> 13:29.749
I just don't understand
why you'd think

13:29.750 --> 13:32.030
I'd love an ambush for
a birthday present.

13:32.955 --> 13:34.471
You're doing so good, Arnold.

13:34.472 --> 13:36.992
Just like a big brave man,
a big brave strong man.

13:36.993 --> 13:38.633
So brave.

13:38.634 --> 13:41.193
I mean, I love being alone.

13:41.194 --> 13:43.515
Why would you 'un-alone' me by surprise

13:43.516 --> 13:45.875
and think that'd be fun for me?

13:46.778 --> 13:47.917
Good as new.

13:59.842 --> 14:01.293
- I'm gonna come.
- Yeah?

14:01.294 --> 14:02.317
You're gonna make me come.

14:13.327 --> 14:15.166
What can I... what can I do to help?

14:15.167 --> 14:18.288
Um, no, really, I'm fine.

14:18.289 --> 14:20.649
No, no, no, we can make this happen.

14:20.650 --> 14:22.770
- Really?
- Yeah.

14:26.532 --> 14:28.011
Uh...

14:28.012 --> 14:29.492
Maybe I'll just...

14:29.493 --> 14:31.454
- Yeah?
- Yeah, I'll do it. Okay.

14:39.937 --> 14:42.017
- What are you doing?
- I'm just...

14:42.018 --> 14:44.658
Okay. Pants.

14:44.659 --> 14:45.899
Okay.

14:47.860 --> 14:49.940
What's wrong?

14:49.941 --> 14:52.552
Your... Just your forehead.

14:52.553 --> 14:54.079
Have you got, like, a little tissue?

15:01.651 --> 15:03.331
- You okay?
- Yeah.

15:03.332 --> 15:05.293
Yeah, I had fun anyway.

15:34.075 --> 15:35.556
Excuse me. Sorry.

15:36.836 --> 15:40.597
* Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh... *

15:46.000 --> 15:48.199
I love corn chips.

15:48.200 --> 15:50.400
You staying up to watch
the tennis tonight?

15:50.401 --> 15:53.443
- No.
- You don't like the tennis?

15:55.683 --> 15:57.804
I... don't know.

15:58.904 --> 16:01.604
I'd love to watch the tennis,
except I'm stuck here.

16:01.605 --> 16:04.899
- Man's gotta eat!
- Yeah, okay.

16:12.904 --> 16:14.744
I have this memory
of just loving him

16:14.745 --> 16:17.274
and the more I try and get it
back, the more I strangle it.

16:17.275 --> 16:18.792
- And I just...
- Yes, I know!

16:18.793 --> 16:20.674
We've been having this same
conversation for six months.

16:20.675 --> 16:22.714
I just feel like the
amount of time I spend

16:22.715 --> 16:27.116
trying to massage this relationship,
I could have learnt the clarinet.

16:27.117 --> 16:30.162
Mm, and clarinets don't ruin
'Shine Bright Like a Diamond'.

16:30.163 --> 16:32.998
Mmm... They probably would, actually.

16:32.999 --> 16:35.960
Absolutely would. Sorry. Just
trying to be supportive.

16:37.441 --> 16:39.681
I mean, I just have to,
don't I? Just have to.

16:39.682 --> 16:41.201
I just have to break up with him.

16:42.002 --> 16:45.163
No, no, no, no, just
take a step back here.

16:45.164 --> 16:47.163
Try and get some perspective.

16:47.164 --> 16:50.165
Everything looks disgusting
from too close, like skin.

16:51.054 --> 16:53.087
No, it's been decided.

16:55.808 --> 16:58.088
I think maybe he just
doesn't like me anymore.

16:58.889 --> 17:01.089
I've been trying so hard
not to fight with him.

17:01.090 --> 17:02.650
And then what happens?

17:03.166 --> 17:05.450
Everything goes blank,
and when I come to,

17:05.451 --> 17:08.291
we're arguing about the
right way to chop an onion.

17:08.292 --> 17:12.012
Well, the good news is Josh
definitely does like you,

17:12.013 --> 17:13.733
so you can stop worrying about that.

17:13.734 --> 17:15.253
Does he, though?

17:15.255 --> 17:18.136
The thing is that you're assuming
he doesn't like you, you know?

17:18.137 --> 17:21.977
And I feel like maybe you assume
that a lot of people don't like you.

17:22.598 --> 17:25.699
So when Josh says to you you're
chopping the onion wrong,

17:25.700 --> 17:28.459
what you hear is, "You're
not the boyfriend I want,"

17:28.460 --> 17:31.261
when really all he's saying is,
"You're chopping the onion wrong."

17:31.262 --> 17:34.661
No, I just want him to say,
"You're doing a really great job.

17:34.662 --> 17:36.943
"I support your decisions."

17:36.944 --> 17:38.663
That doesn't sound like Josh.

17:38.664 --> 17:40.784
Don't know who that sounds
like, to be honest.

17:40.785 --> 17:43.546
Definitely not someone we
would become friends with.

17:53.591 --> 17:55.791
Hey. Hey!

17:56.791 --> 17:58.711
Excuse me.

17:59.072 --> 18:00.831
Hey, excuse me.

18:01.545 --> 18:02.385
Yes?

18:03.686 --> 18:05.367
Can I ask you something?

18:06.941 --> 18:09.395
- What?
- Are you married?

18:10.997 --> 18:13.637
Hey! Hey, wait!

18:13.638 --> 18:16.559
You don't have to be rude. I'm
just asking you a question.

18:16.560 --> 18:19.719
Hey, excuse... excuse me.

18:19.720 --> 18:21.320
You're being very rude, young lady!

18:21.321 --> 18:22.868
Fuck off!

18:22.869 --> 18:25.121
- Oh, fuck off! Leave me alone!
- All right!

18:25.122 --> 18:27.720
- Get lost! Leave me alone!
- All right, I'm sorry.

18:30.336 --> 18:31.617
Crazy bitch!

18:39.047 --> 18:40.808
Hi. I'm Josh. I'm not here.

18:40.809 --> 18:42.768
I'm sorry. Leave a message. Goodbye.

18:42.769 --> 18:45.169
Uh, hi, luvvie. I'm sorry I
missed your call before.

18:45.170 --> 18:47.050
I hope you're having a
really lovely time camping

18:47.051 --> 18:49.491
and I really hope that Hannah's
having a good time too.

18:49.492 --> 18:52.852
Um, uh, uh, goodbye. See you.

18:52.853 --> 18:55.973
Fireworks are ready! Are you ready?

18:55.974 --> 18:58.175
Josh just told me he's
breaking up with Arnold.

18:58.176 --> 19:00.455
What? No, no, no, no, no.

19:00.456 --> 19:03.857
I am in love with Hannah for doing this.

19:03.858 --> 19:05.337
- Yeah.
- I'm using them all!

19:05.338 --> 19:06.937
My whole stash!

19:06.938 --> 19:09.659
- Oh, shit, I really stuffed up.
- What do you mean?

19:09.660 --> 19:13.860
Thing is, once you light them, they
require your immediate attention!

19:13.861 --> 19:16.261
I just told Arnold that Josh
was still in love with him.

19:16.262 --> 19:18.822
- Why would you do that?
- Are you paying attention?!

19:18.823 --> 19:20.704
I was just trying to be helpful.

19:28.547 --> 19:30.027
Oh!

19:31.068 --> 19:33.588
Oh...

19:33.589 --> 19:35.589
Fuckin' light.

19:35.590 --> 19:37.190
Oh!

19:38.351 --> 19:40.151
Shit! Shit!

19:40.152 --> 19:42.511
Fuck!

19:46.234 --> 19:48.073
Yes.

19:49.956 --> 19:52.756
Oh! Ooh!

20:09.883 --> 20:11.642
I love you.

20:11.643 --> 20:13.485
I love you.

20:23.448 --> 20:25.688
Yes! That was great!

20:25.689 --> 20:27.449
- Yeah, it was.
- Yes, it was.

20:57.181 --> 20:59.461
Oh, no, what's wrong?

20:59.462 --> 21:01.382
Um...

21:01.383 --> 21:03.103
I think we have to break up.

21:05.545 --> 21:08.265
Oh, no. No, no, no.

21:08.266 --> 21:10.945
Yeah, no, I'm sorry. I just...

21:10.946 --> 21:12.947
You wanna throw me away?

21:12.948 --> 21:14.907
What? No. No, I just...

21:14.908 --> 21:16.907
No, I just...

21:16.908 --> 21:18.949
Oh, no, I really thought
you saw this coming.

21:18.950 --> 21:21.389
Honestly, I thought you'd be relieved.

21:21.390 --> 21:23.311
Why here?

21:23.312 --> 21:25.151
I just got overwhelmed.
We're always fighting.

21:25.152 --> 21:28.793
And... I mean, I did not
think this through.

21:29.650 --> 21:32.698
Morning! I'm making porridge.

21:34.596 --> 21:36.436
You had to do this here?

21:36.437 --> 21:40.438
Now? You couldn't pretend to
like me until we got home?

21:41.231 --> 21:44.838
I just got a bit overwhelmed
and, yeah, I made a mistake.

21:44.839 --> 21:47.520
Oh, my God, this is happening.

21:47.521 --> 21:50.522
I can't believe this
is actually happening!

21:50.523 --> 21:52.622
- Sorry.
- Fuck you!

21:52.623 --> 21:54.573
Seriously, stop crying.

21:54.574 --> 21:55.392
He's crying in there?

21:55.908 --> 21:58.778
Nuh, porridge is too
cheerful for this shit.

21:59.145 --> 22:02.575
Always worrying about
your fucking forehead.

22:02.576 --> 22:04.697
It's not even your worst feature.

22:04.698 --> 22:07.177
- Mole on lip.
- Tom, don't.

22:07.178 --> 22:09.178
You are incapable of being happy!

22:09.179 --> 22:14.500
Anytime everyone is happy and
calm, you say something mean.

22:14.501 --> 22:17.061
You're always trying to start a fight.

22:17.062 --> 22:20.302
A pathological quest for stimulus.

22:20.303 --> 22:22.464
Claire got out. She did it.

22:22.465 --> 22:25.304
I should have taken the hint
when your best friend left you

22:25.305 --> 22:27.266
that you're a shit guy.

22:27.267 --> 22:30.986
I wish I could have taken
the hint for myself. Fuck!

22:31.665 --> 22:35.028
You are never going to be happy, Josh.

22:38.791 --> 22:41.951
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

22:41.952 --> 22:45.553
I'm sorry, Josh. I didn't...
I didn't mean it, Josh.

22:45.554 --> 22:47.433
I'm sorry.

22:47.434 --> 22:49.794
Please. Please don't.

22:49.795 --> 22:51.876
You don't have to do this.

22:54.316 --> 22:55.916
He broke up with me.

22:55.917 --> 22:58.957
He's such a jerk.

23:09.563 --> 23:11.362
Ooh, I love this song.

23:11.363 --> 23:13.203
No, Ella, let's not turn
this song up, yeah?

23:22.848 --> 23:27.169
* For all the times that you
made me feel small *

23:27.170 --> 23:30.929
* I fell in love, now I
feel nothing at all... *

23:30.930 --> 23:32.691
Ooh-hoo! This really is not ideal.

23:32.692 --> 23:34.077
It's okay. It's fine.

23:34.078 --> 23:36.480
* And never felt so low
when I was vulnerable *

23:36.481 --> 23:41.334
* Was I a fool to let you
break down my walls? *

23:41.335 --> 23:46.616
* 'Cause if you like the
way you look that much *

23:46.617 --> 23:50.179
* Oh, baby, you should
go and love yourself *

23:51.339 --> 23:57.140
* And if you think that I'm
still holdin' onto something *

23:57.141 --> 24:00.262
* You should go and love yourself *

24:00.263 --> 24:05.743
* And if you like the way
you look that much *

24:05.744 --> 24:09.625
* Oh, baby, you should
go and love yourself *

24:09.626 --> 24:11.865
- * Yeah! *
- * And if you think *

24:11.866 --> 24:13.347
- * You think *
- * That I'm *

24:13.348 --> 24:16.347
- * That I'm *
- * Still holdin' onto something *

24:16.348 --> 24:19.151
* You should go and love yourself *
