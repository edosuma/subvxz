WEBVTT

00:01.192 --> 00:03.303
Previously on NYPD Blue.

00:03.374 --> 00:07.728
Adrianne has made a change
in terms of her... preferences.

00:07.801 --> 00:09.234
Yeah. Away from me.

00:09.309 --> 00:11.682
- And towards women.
- Get out of here!

00:11.748 --> 00:14.373
You tell Greg to tell me you're gay.
Then I hear rumors you're not gay.

00:14.443 --> 00:16.391
I don't know what I am.

00:16.465 --> 00:19.790
I said what I said to discourage you
because I didn't think we should go out.

00:19.866 --> 00:22.174
So today, you're gay or you're not?

00:22.240 --> 00:24.668
I like it when you smile,
like it a lot.

00:24.743 --> 00:28.715
- I'm gonna make you smile all the time.
- Come on inside, James.

00:28.786 --> 00:31.281
I thought you'd never ask.

00:49.097 --> 00:51.437
- Morning.
- Hi.

00:51.504 --> 00:53.418
- Hi, Donna.
- Hi.

00:53.492 --> 00:58.327
- So, uh, tonight's a pretty big night for me.
- Yeah?

00:58.401 --> 01:00.414
In what regards?

01:00.487 --> 01:03.944
In confidence, I've been seeing someone
we're both acquainted with.

01:04.016 --> 01:06.413
Oh, James Martinez.

01:06.488 --> 01:08.599
I thought we'd been so discreet.

01:08.670 --> 01:11.065
It's all this time
working around detectives.

01:11.140 --> 01:13.897
Anyway, tonight-
tonight will be kind of the last hurdle.

01:16.210 --> 01:18.102
You haven't made love yet?

01:18.167 --> 01:21.022
I wanted to wait, see if we were
compatible in other areas first.

01:21.087 --> 01:24.894
- Makes sense.
- Well, we wanted to wait two months.

01:24.969 --> 01:26.829
I decided. James went along.

01:26.895 --> 01:29.170
But he's really
been a doll about it.

01:29.237 --> 01:31.895
- So tonight's the night.
- Yeah.

01:31.964 --> 01:35.586
- I bought some things at Victoria's Secret.
- What'd you get?

01:35.654 --> 01:37.547
Stockings and a garter
and a teddy.

01:37.612 --> 01:41.397
- Don't try to fit into the teddy.
- What? You don't think?

01:41.462 --> 01:45.784
Mm. It'll interrupt the natural course of events.
Save the teddy for another time.

01:45.858 --> 01:47.838
Yeah, I see.

01:47.911 --> 01:52.331
- I hope it goes great for you.
- Yeah. Thanks a lot, Donna.

01:56.350 --> 01:59.008
- Good morning, James.
- Morning, Adrianne.

02:01.003 --> 02:04.110
- Hi.
- Mission Control, all systems are go.

02:04.179 --> 02:06.290
Cut it out, Greg, will you?

02:08.126 --> 02:11.550
Simone and Sipowicz,
homicide in the Village.

02:11.623 --> 02:16.174
Adrianne, work backup with James.
Medavoy, um, shooting on Fourth Street.

02:16.244 --> 02:20.029
- Take Russell.
- James is in the locker room, huh?

02:20.094 --> 02:24.033
Uh, yeah. I'll get him.

02:25.068 --> 02:27.048
Andy.

02:29.752 --> 02:32.214
- Hey, James.
- Yeah?

02:32.287 --> 02:34.912
We got a homicide. Uh, you and Adrianne,
you want to give us a hand?

02:34.982 --> 02:37.859
Yeah. All right.

02:37.934 --> 02:41.489
- How you feeling, man? You good?
- Yeah. What do you mean?

02:41.560 --> 02:44.152
No, I-I was just
asking how you felt.

02:45.635 --> 02:48.490
- You know too?
- I heard some things.

02:48.555 --> 02:50.567
That Greg's got such a mouth.

02:50.640 --> 02:52.718
You know,
I'm no Don Juan or nothing...

02:52.791 --> 02:55.219
but normally an event like this
wouldn't be such a big deal.

02:55.293 --> 02:59.297
Adrianne marking a day on her calendar,
thinking about it so long...

02:59.368 --> 03:01.228
it's like, uh, training
for the Golden Gloves.

03:01.293 --> 03:04.050
Going over my combinations, footwork.

03:04.117 --> 03:05.812
- You're the man, James.
- No, you're the man.

03:05.881 --> 03:08.157
- Bobby, uh, g-give me some advice.
- Yeah?

03:08.224 --> 03:12.709
- Sure.
- Well, usually I use this ultra-sensitive type thing...

03:12.780 --> 03:15.822
but, uh, tonight, I was thinking,
you know, I'd go ribbed.

03:15.893 --> 03:17.873
Show her I'm not just concerned
about me and...

03:17.946 --> 03:19.861
What do you think?

03:20.834 --> 03:22.684
Hmm.

04:49.349 --> 04:51.909
Look at this.
The creep's into late-night talk shows.

04:53.136 --> 04:54.996
Dave and Jay."

04:55.061 --> 04:58.234
Gutted like a fish. Guts and everything
are in the sink in there.

04:58.302 --> 05:02.624
Wallet's on the floor.
If she had any credit cards, they're gone.

05:02.698 --> 05:06.537
- Oh, man.
- Me and Adrianne will start canvassing.

05:06.612 --> 05:08.078
- All right.
- Victim's Felicia Akins, 26.

05:08.152 --> 05:10.427
Her mother called the super after
she couldn't reach her on the phone.

05:10.494 --> 05:13.251
The super came in,
found this and called 911.

05:13.318 --> 05:15.658
- Where's the super at?
- I'll go get him.

05:15.725 --> 05:18.865
The way I figure it, he dipped these panties in
the blood and used those to write on the wall.

05:18.933 --> 05:21.591
Then he must've come back,
left them in here.

05:21.661 --> 05:24.604
- Didn't you say something about a super?
- Yeah. I'm going go get him.

05:24.677 --> 05:26.886
Unless you caught this one.
Did you catch this case and I didn't realize?

05:26.955 --> 05:29.777
- Did somebody turn this on?
- No, sir. It was on when we arrived.

05:29.843 --> 05:33.267
I'm gonna go get the super.

05:33.340 --> 05:36.382
Black girl listening to country and western?
Does that make sense?

05:36.453 --> 05:39.363
Maybe the killer's a good ol' boy.

05:50.121 --> 05:52.299
This is the super, Mr. Chernik.

05:52.367 --> 05:54.609
I'm Detective Simone.
This is Detective Sipowicz.

05:54.678 --> 05:57.883
- You found Miss Akins?
- Yeah. Her, uh, mother called...

05:57.950 --> 06:01.221
said her daughter wasn't answering the phone,
wanted me to go up and check on her.

06:01.287 --> 06:04.164
- You live on the first floor?
- I got a room in the basement.

06:04.239 --> 06:05.902
Did you know the victim at all?

06:05.972 --> 06:07.952
- Not really.
- You notice the kind of guys she dated?

06:08.025 --> 06:10.683
- Mainly interracial.
- Oh, yeah?

06:10.753 --> 06:14.921
Anything particular about any of her dates?
Western type guys, anything like that?

06:14.988 --> 06:17.581
Like cowboy hats?
Not that I noticed.

06:17.651 --> 06:21.885
L- I can't believe what I saw in that apartment.
I mean, what he did to her.

06:21.951 --> 06:25.823
Yeah. Listen, thanks a lot.
We may have to talk to you again, all right?

06:25.898 --> 06:29.169
Newsstand guy down the block saw a guy with
a bloody hand crossing the street at 2:00 a.m.

06:29.235 --> 06:31.729
I got Crime Scene looking
for bloodstains on the pavement.

06:31.802 --> 06:35.554
And we'll check the emergency rooms for
cut hands they may have treated last night.

06:35.620 --> 06:39.427
- What a mess in there, huh?
- Yeah. Let's check out this D.O.A.

06:48.038 --> 06:50.313
I'm not gonna go in that ambulance.

06:50.379 --> 06:52.425
I don't want to go where
you are trying to take me.

06:52.498 --> 06:54.478
- Hey, Joe.
- Hey. Victim's Sidney Herman.

06:54.551 --> 06:57.013
Couple black guys
stuck him up on the street.

06:57.086 --> 06:59.328
Took one shot in the shoulder,
made it over here and collapsed.

06:59.396 --> 07:01.255
- Thanks.
- You better call a car service, Dale.

07:01.321 --> 07:02.951
I'll never get a cab in this neighborhood.

07:03.022 --> 07:05.297
Excuse me. I'm Detective Medavoy.
This is Detective Russell.

07:05.364 --> 07:06.994
We're from the 15th Squad.

07:07.065 --> 07:09.460
The hospital I have to get to
is the Hospital for Special Surgery.

07:09.535 --> 07:12.773
I'm in danger oflosing the use of my arm here.
They took my car. Can you drive me?

07:12.840 --> 07:14.951
- It's on 70th Street.
- Take it easy, sir.

07:15.022 --> 07:18.325
I told him we have to take him to the nearest
trauma hospital, which is Bellevue.

07:18.398 --> 07:21.823
No! I am a physician.
I am in danger of losing the use of my arm.

07:21.896 --> 07:24.806
I'm a surgeon. If there
is nerve damage in this arm, I can't work.

07:24.880 --> 07:27.921
Why don't you take him where he wants?
Professional courtesy, all right?

07:27.992 --> 07:30.004
- Yeah. Okay.
- Excuse me, Miss?

07:30.077 --> 07:34.847
- Miss, who are you?
- I'm Dr. Herman's office manager. My name is Dale Epton.

07:34.923 --> 07:37.965
Dale, call Ian Miller at Special Surgery.
Tell him I might need a procedure.

07:38.035 --> 07:40.529
- I want him to consult.
- I will, Sid.

07:40.602 --> 07:43.030
Tell him the feeling isn't returning.
There's no sensation in the arm.

07:43.105 --> 07:46.146
Do you have the phone number
and the address of this special hospital?

07:46.217 --> 07:49.937
- Dale, I need you there.
- As soon as I can, Siddy.

07:50.003 --> 07:52.946
- And I guess you better call Scarsdale.
- Oh, my, God.

07:53.019 --> 07:55.032
Wh-What's in Scarsdale?

07:55.105 --> 07:57.567
His wife.

07:57.640 --> 08:02.409
Miss Epton, please. Can you please
help us out with what happened here?

08:02.485 --> 08:06.073
Um, Dr. Herman called me from his car
when he was about a block away.

08:06.143 --> 08:08.998
- The buzzer is broken.
- The buzzer to where?

08:09.063 --> 08:11.207
- I live in this building.
- Uh-huh.

08:11.277 --> 08:15.762
The office is on 61 st, but we're closed today.
And Dr. Herman had to drop off some papers.

08:15.833 --> 08:19.137
- I see.
- So you weren't a witness to him being shot?

08:19.202 --> 08:21.543
No. L-I heard him shout
from the cellular phone.

08:21.608 --> 08:23.949
And I came downstairs,
and he'd made it to the sidewalk.

08:24.015 --> 08:26.958
He said two black guys
grabbed him and got his keys.

08:27.031 --> 08:29.306
He said he was trying to cooperate,
to give them the wallet...

08:29.374 --> 08:32.196
- but they shot him anyway.
- He said there were two black men?

08:32.260 --> 08:34.208
Did he mention anything
else about them?

08:34.283 --> 08:37.707
Yeah. He said, uh, the one
with the gun was tall...

08:37.780 --> 08:41.138
and he had a shaved head
and he had an earring.

08:41.212 --> 08:44.386
- What kind of car does Dr. Herman drive?
- A Mercedes 500 sedan.

08:44.454 --> 08:46.981
And the wallet they took
was black calfskin.

08:47.053 --> 08:52.020
And it had his initials embossed on the front
with sort of, like, fancy Roman lettering.

08:52.090 --> 08:55.197
- You gave him the wallet?
- Yeah.

08:55.268 --> 09:00.979
All right. Here's his service number
and mine underneath.

09:01.043 --> 09:04.795
Look, I really need to be with Siddy.
I'm his personal assistant.

09:04.861 --> 09:08.219
- Yeah, sure. All right, go ahead. Here.
- Taxi!

09:09.257 --> 09:13.841
- She needs to be with Siddy.
- Yeah. He was dropping off the papers.

09:22.413 --> 09:26.165
The woman's murdered
with a knife. Disemboweled.

09:26.231 --> 09:30.366
Satanic writing on the walls
in blood-Jay and Dave.

09:30.434 --> 09:33.159
- Hm, what's that about?
- I don't know. You tell me.

09:33.225 --> 09:35.818
Nobody in the building
heard any commotion.

09:35.889 --> 09:38.514
News vendor saw some guy running
from the building around 2:00 a.m.

09:38.584 --> 09:40.980
Looked like he was bleeding
from his hand or his arm.

09:41.055 --> 09:42.969
Martinez and Lesniak are
checking with the E.R.'s.

09:43.044 --> 09:46.151
We're looking into recent releases
from the psychiatric ward.

09:46.221 --> 09:49.229
- Any chance this psycho stuff's a misdirect?
- Sure.

09:49.301 --> 09:53.305
Bobby's in there with one of the D.O.A.'s
work friends. See what she knows.

09:53.376 --> 09:56.100
What happened to her?
I mean, what did he do to her?

09:56.168 --> 09:58.826
Let's not talk about that right now, Patty.
The way that you can really help us...

09:58.895 --> 10:01.006
is to let us know what your connection
with Felicia was.

10:01.077 --> 10:06.044
Okay, sure. Um, we worked together at
Feldman and Hawes. We're legal secretaries.

10:06.114 --> 10:08.356
Did she have any enemies?
Anyone that might have wanted to hurt her?

10:08.425 --> 10:10.405
No one I knew of.

10:10.478 --> 10:13.486
- Look, I actually feel awkward about this.
- Why?

10:13.558 --> 10:18.273
Because Felicia was really nice, and I don't
want to say anything bad about her.

10:18.339 --> 10:20.549
Uh-huh. Well, uh...

10:20.617 --> 10:22.794
Excuse me.

10:25.046 --> 10:28.283
- She's a deep thinker.
- We got a possible over at NYU.

10:28.350 --> 10:32.135
The infirmary treated a Gordon Puterbaugh
last night. His home address is bogus...

10:32.200 --> 10:34.443
but we got a employer address
off his health insurance.

10:34.511 --> 10:37.486
Some baby store.
Me and Adrianne are heading over there.

10:39.067 --> 10:41.725
Well, Patty...

10:41.794 --> 10:45.032
don't worry about what our impression
about what Felicia's gonna be, all right?

10:45.099 --> 10:47.790
We're trying to find her killers.

10:47.858 --> 10:53.110
Felicia had this plan,
I guess you would call it. Um...

10:53.185 --> 10:56.292
she wanted to marry
a rich guy, okay?

10:56.362 --> 10:58.987
I mean, who doesn't, right?
But she really wanted to.

10:59.057 --> 11:01.912
I mean, we work with these lawyers
that make tons of money.

11:01.977 --> 11:05.150
And their wives spend all day shopping and
getting facials, and that's what she wanted.

11:05.218 --> 11:10.152
And then I'd say about a month ago,
she started talking really different, you know...

11:10.223 --> 11:12.685
like, To hell with these
uptight jerks" and so on.

11:12.758 --> 11:17.210
And finally she asked
had I ever tired Ecstasy?

11:17.282 --> 11:20.007
- Do you know what I'm talking about?
- Ecstasy, the drug.

11:20.073 --> 11:21.933
Yeah. She said she
had gotten into Ecstasy...

11:21.998 --> 11:26.418
and that it had really opened doors for her
in terms of, um, you know...

11:26.491 --> 11:29.795
- Sex.
- Right.

11:29.860 --> 11:35.056
And that was what she was into now.
You know, partying with guys she'd meet at clubs.

11:35.122 --> 11:37.879
And I went out with her once.

11:37.946 --> 11:41.338
And, I mean,
she was into these guys...

11:41.411 --> 11:44.419
that she and I would never
have looked at before.

11:44.492 --> 11:46.865
And I was, like, shocked.

11:46.930 --> 11:48.975
And I wanted to believe
that it was a phase.

11:49.048 --> 11:52.571
- Now I see it got her killed.
- Do you know what clubs it was that she went to?

11:52.642 --> 11:56.263
Um, Double 'L,"
um, Streets of Laredo.

11:56.331 --> 11:58.191
These are still white guys
that she was interested in?

11:58.257 --> 12:00.335
Yeah. But a totally different type.

12:00.406 --> 12:02.868
Do you remember anyone specific from
that night that you went out with her?

12:02.941 --> 12:07.525
No. That's what I keep trying to think of.
And I can't come up with one specific face.

12:07.594 --> 12:10.734
- It's just this type.
- A non-lawyer?

12:10.802 --> 12:13.745
Yeah. And I got out of there
before she picked one up.

12:13.819 --> 12:17.823
How about the last few days?
Did she mention anybody she met recently?

12:17.893 --> 12:20.388
But I wasn't at work on Friday, so...

12:27.038 --> 12:28.931
He's not here right now.

12:29.990 --> 12:33.895
Yeah, I'll let him know.
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

12:33.969 --> 12:37.590
Okay. Well, I'll write
it down then. Okay.

12:37.659 --> 12:40.733
Will you put that person on hold?

12:41.991 --> 12:46.060
555-0199.

12:46.130 --> 12:50.199
Got it.
Don't smack your hand on my desk.

12:50.268 --> 12:53.146
Then do your job and stop
gabbing on the phone.

12:53.221 --> 12:55.398
I need to see
Detective Medavoy or Russell.

12:55.467 --> 12:57.327
Ma'am.

12:57.392 --> 13:01.626
- I'm Detective Medavoy.
- I'm Jessica Herman, Dr. Herman's wife.

13:01.692 --> 13:04.284
- How's your husband doing?
- Well, we won't know for a few hours.

13:04.354 --> 13:06.849
The doctors in Special Surgery
are not optimistic.

13:06.921 --> 13:09.645
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- Someone needs to pay for this, Detective.

13:09.713 --> 13:13.334
And I'm not talking about Sidney's
woefully inadequate disability insurance.

13:13.403 --> 13:16.478
- I want to file charges.
- Uh, ma'am.

13:16.547 --> 13:21.547
Uh, charges can't be filed until, uh,
until we know who the perpetrators are.

13:21.617 --> 13:25.522
I want to file charges against Dale Epton,
my husband's assistant.

13:25.596 --> 13:29.381
- Miss Epton isn't a suspect.
- She's the cause of this whole thing.

13:29.446 --> 13:32.104
She enticed Sidney into
that wretched neighborhood.

13:32.174 --> 13:35.281
She's as responsible as if she was the man
who pulled the trigger.

13:35.350 --> 13:40.219
Uh, no offense, ma'am, but what
you're saying sounds a little, uh, silly.

13:41.800 --> 13:45.289
- Who's your supervisor?
- That would be Lieutenant Fancy.

13:45.361 --> 13:47.921
Get Lieutenant Fancy.

13:51.233 --> 13:56.845
Lieu, this is Dr. Herman's wife.
She would like to speak with my supervisor.

13:56.913 --> 13:59.057
Yeah. I'm Detective Medavoy's supervisor.

13:59.126 --> 14:01.653
Detective Medavoy is being
completely uncooperative.

14:01.726 --> 14:04.066
I want to file charges
against Dale Epton.

14:04.132 --> 14:06.046
Dale Epton is the woman
the surgeon was visiting, Lieu.

14:06.121 --> 14:07.981
And what do you want to
charge her with?

14:08.046 --> 14:11.886
Contributing to the shooting of a citizen,
uh, accessory to a crime, I don't know.

14:11.961 --> 14:15.418
That's for you to figure out.
That's what my tax dollars are for.

14:15.490 --> 14:18.915
Actually, your tax dollars
pay for the Scarsdale police.

14:18.988 --> 14:20.716
I know this is an awkward
situation, Mrs. Herman...

14:20.785 --> 14:23.892
but having a personal relationship
with your boss isn't illegal.

14:23.961 --> 14:26.521
Do they train you people to be insensitive?

14:26.592 --> 14:29.797
Excuse me.

14:29.865 --> 14:32.720
You won't be so cavalier
when you're all dragged into court.

14:32.785 --> 14:37.850
Do you think that I haven't read about
your zero tolerance zone? No crimes allowed.

14:37.918 --> 14:41.376
- I bet that wretched neighborhood was a zero tolerance zone.
- Could be.

14:41.449 --> 14:44.009
Why don't you confer with your lawyer?

14:44.080 --> 14:48.247
I'm going to show that you knew that a shooting
was likely to occur and you did nothing.

14:48.315 --> 14:50.492
I want all your crime statistics.

14:50.561 --> 14:55.943
- Ma'am, you cannot order our personnel around like that.
- Why won't somebody help me?

14:56.015 --> 14:58.673
How can you expect people
to help you...

14:58.743 --> 15:01.116
when you talk to them like
they're something the cat dragged in?

15:01.181 --> 15:03.906
- Donna.
- I may not have a marriage.

15:03.973 --> 15:08.207
And if I do, my husband may not be
able to work. What am I supposed to do?

15:08.272 --> 15:10.865
Grow up.

15:13.887 --> 15:17.027
I'm going to have that bitch... fired.

15:18.829 --> 15:20.842
Shall I pack my desk, Detective?

15:44.594 --> 15:46.837
- Hey.
- Hi.

15:46.905 --> 15:49.947
I'm Detective Simone.
This is Detective Sipowicz.

15:50.017 --> 15:53.572
You, uh, recognize this girl
in this picture here?

15:53.643 --> 15:56.138
Yeah. I think she's
been in here a few times.

15:56.210 --> 15:58.070
Who does Felicia come in with?

15:58.135 --> 16:01.373
Uh...

16:01.440 --> 16:03.935
I think I remember her
being in here with, um...

16:04.007 --> 16:06.534
a blond-haired guy
and another girl.

16:06.606 --> 16:09.648
- She in trouble?
- She was murdered.

16:09.718 --> 16:11.862
- Wow.
- You know either of the people she was with?

16:11.933 --> 16:14.328
- Not really.
- What did the guy look like?

16:15.558 --> 16:17.986
I don't know.
That was three or four days ago.

16:18.061 --> 16:20.456
You dropped your coat here, man.

16:20.531 --> 16:24.316
- Nice coat.
- Thanks. Thanks.

16:24.382 --> 16:26.657
You worried about what I'm gonna find
if I look in this pocket here?

16:34.425 --> 16:38.112
He had, uh, short hair, long sideburns.

16:38.179 --> 16:42.446
His skin looked pretty bad and, uh,
the girls here were doing kamikazes.

16:42.511 --> 16:45.869
And the guy paid with a check.
That's right. I remember that.

16:45.944 --> 16:47.956
He didn't have his phone number on it,
so I had to give him a pen.

16:48.029 --> 16:51.421
- The check go to the bank yet?
- No. We don't take them in on Saturdays or Sundays.

16:51.495 --> 16:53.573
It might still be in the office.

16:53.644 --> 16:56.139
I'll go take a look?

17:04.906 --> 17:07.915
- James, I don't want to go out to dinner.
- No, huh?

17:07.987 --> 17:10.579
- Unless you really do.
- No. I ain't got no big thing for going out.

17:10.651 --> 17:14.940
- We could stop at the grocery. I could make some of that pasta.
- Great. Sure.

17:15.015 --> 17:18.439
I just want to be with you
as close as possible as soon as possible.

17:18.512 --> 17:20.426
Hey, I'll take a sick day right now.

17:20.501 --> 17:25.532
Excuse me. But my entire existence
has just been turned topsy-turvy...

17:25.603 --> 17:29.356
and you two are having a casual conversation
about your evening plans.

17:29.421 --> 17:31.631
We try not to get attached to people
we bring in for questioning.

17:31.699 --> 17:35.988
There's the detectives you're gonna be talking
to. Can I get you coffee or something?

17:36.063 --> 17:39.038
Yes. I would like that very much.
Cream and two sugars, please.

17:39.111 --> 17:41.256
- No problem.
- Thank you. I appreciate that.

17:42.288 --> 17:44.432
- Okay.
- Yeah, sure, I'll hold.

17:44.502 --> 17:49.666
Guy with the cut hand, uh, leaving
the D.O.A.'s apartment, Gordon Puterbaugh.

17:49.732 --> 17:52.193
Thanks, Adrianne. Can you do me a favor?
Can you pick up with B.C. I?

17:52.266 --> 17:55.341
We're running a Clyde Fulmer.
He bought the D.O.A. Some drinks.

17:55.411 --> 17:59.546
Oh, he wants a coffee with cream and
two sugars, if you want to make friends.

17:59.614 --> 18:02.174
- Yeah, I'm still holding.
- Hey, Bobby.

18:02.245 --> 18:05.833
Hi, James. Mr. Puterbaugh, I'm Detective
Simone. This is Detective Sipowicz.

18:05.903 --> 18:07.851
We'll be talking in there.

18:07.925 --> 18:10.265
- I guess I don't have much choice.
- Can I get you some coffee?

18:10.332 --> 18:14.499
- I think that female detective is getting me some.
- I'll be getting it for you.

18:14.567 --> 18:16.995
- How do you take it?
- Cream and two sugars.

18:17.070 --> 18:19.148
All right, this way.
Come on.

18:21.883 --> 18:23.797
Have a seat.

18:23.871 --> 18:28.226
- This is a living nightmare.
- I just need to ask you a few questions.

18:28.300 --> 18:32.719
- And then I can go home?
- Where were you last night?

18:32.792 --> 18:35.866
That's what you want to know? I could have
told the other detectives that in the car.

18:35.936 --> 18:38.496
Tell me.

18:38.567 --> 18:41.707
I closed the baby shop
where I work at 7:00.

18:41.776 --> 18:46.940
And then I went to the store to buy some things
and went to Mrs. Pattou's to make dinner.

18:47.006 --> 18:50.146
- Who's that?
- You're really frightening me with your tone!

18:52.525 --> 18:55.250
Well, then, let's try
to take it easy, Gordon.

19:09.242 --> 19:11.157
- Okay, I'm better now.
- Good.

19:11.232 --> 19:13.474
Who is Mrs. Pattou?

19:13.542 --> 19:17.513
An elderly shut-in.
I'm a volunteer at the community center.

19:17.584 --> 19:21.009
I prepare home-cooked meals
for old people in the neighborhood.

19:21.082 --> 19:23.357
Last night was
my first time with her.

19:23.424 --> 19:25.667
I made a vegetarian lasagna.

19:25.734 --> 19:27.627
Where's this Mrs. Pattou live?

19:27.692 --> 19:30.799
Uh, Barrow between, uh,
Greenwich and Hudson.

19:30.868 --> 19:33.539
- What time did you leave her place?
- About 2:00.

19:33.667 --> 19:36.642
2:00, huh? Boy, that was
a long dinner, huh?

19:36.715 --> 19:40.850
Well, after dinner, we- Mrs. Pattou and I
fell asleep watching television.

19:40.918 --> 19:44.091
Before I knew it, it was already past 1:00.
I still hadn't done the dishes.

19:44.159 --> 19:47.266
Do you like to go club at all?
You know, line dance?

19:47.336 --> 19:49.032
You ever go
to the Streets of Laredo? Double L"?

19:50.544 --> 19:53.039
No.

19:53.112 --> 19:55.322
What happened to your hand?

19:55.390 --> 19:57.501
Uh, I was washing
Mrs. Pattou's dishes...

19:57.572 --> 19:59.552
and put my hand
into the soapy water...

19:59.625 --> 20:02.633
and somehow cut myself
on a paring knife.

20:02.705 --> 20:05.396
There was a woman who was murdered at
the building that you were visiting last night.

20:05.465 --> 20:08.736
- She was cut up with a knife.
- Oh, my God.

20:10.149 --> 20:11.976
No, wait.
You don't think I...

20:13.423 --> 20:15.884
I- I would never harm
another person.

20:15.957 --> 20:19.677
- Then why did you give NYU Infirmary
a phony address? - L-I didn't!

20:19.743 --> 20:22.238
6820 Perry.

20:22.310 --> 20:24.520
That's the Hudson River.

20:24.588 --> 20:27.246
I put 682,
which is my address.

20:33.508 --> 20:35.586
It could be a piece of dirt
from the photocopier.

20:35.658 --> 20:38.481
Wha...

20:38.546 --> 20:41.106
Stand up for a second.

20:41.177 --> 20:43.255
Stand up.

20:43.326 --> 20:46.784
Look, you're still gonna have to stay here
until we talk to this Mrs. Pattou.

20:46.857 --> 20:49.996
What the hell kind of name is that?

20:50.065 --> 20:55.097
I didn't feel I knew her well enough to ask.
She'll verify everything I said, believe me.

20:56.290 --> 20:58.205
Finish your coffee.

21:00.461 --> 21:03.338
Where are you going?
Sit down.

21:06.044 --> 21:09.917
A guy named Puterbaugh probably didn't
figure Pattou for such a strange name.

21:09.991 --> 21:12.649
Sounds like somebody
working up a luggie.

21:12.718 --> 21:15.180
- What's open, Bobby?
- We got somebody in 2.

21:15.253 --> 21:18.010
- I think 3's open.
- You like this guy for the doc that got shot?

21:18.077 --> 21:21.119
Two uniforms picked him up
for shoplifting over at Paragon Sports.

21:21.189 --> 21:23.946
They're vouchering his possessions,
find the doctor's wallet.

21:26.740 --> 21:28.633
You think she heard
that luggie remark?

21:28.697 --> 21:33.631
Hey, Clyde Fulmer came with four collars
for drug possession, two for menacing...

21:33.703 --> 21:36.711
- and one for a bad check at Aqueduct.
- So Clyde Fulmer reads right.

21:36.783 --> 21:40.820
Nothing puts him at the scene. Puterbaugh's
running from the building, blood on his hands.

21:40.890 --> 21:45.277
- Comes up like a Sunday school teacher.
- Let's try this Mrs. Pattou.

21:45.350 --> 21:48.074
- Thanks, Adrianne.
- Good night.

21:52.827 --> 21:55.649
Medavoy says Martinez and Lesniak
are hitting the rack tonight.

21:55.714 --> 21:59.270
You know, if Greg would have known the plans
for D-day, we'd all be talking German.

22:09.575 --> 22:13.678
- I bought that wallet.
- I guess they accidentally put the wrong initials on it.

22:13.747 --> 22:16.722
Oh, that's-
th-that's for my street name.

22:16.795 --> 22:19.618
- Yeah? What's that?
- Sugar Bear.

22:21.352 --> 22:24.327
- Sugar House.
- Where were you 1:00 today?

22:24.399 --> 22:27.539
- Hanging out.
- You miss the joint, Sugar House?

22:27.608 --> 22:30.463
'Cause the man that owns that wallet
got shot and he's fighting for his life.

22:30.527 --> 22:32.605
- I found that wallet.
- Oh, now you found it.

22:32.678 --> 22:36.036
Th-That's the truth, man. There was nothing
in it. No cards or cash. So I thought it was cool.

22:36.111 --> 22:39.218
- Where'd you find it?
- Alley, over by the park.

22:39.288 --> 22:41.268
- Dude tossed it.
- Who tossed it?

22:41.341 --> 22:44.196
- Clarence.
- Do better, Kenny.

22:44.260 --> 22:46.273
That's all I know.

22:46.346 --> 22:49.486
I seen him around. I heard this other dude
say Clarence. Might not be his name.

22:49.555 --> 22:53.078
- What's Clarence look like?
- I didn't see him much. He's African-American.

22:53.149 --> 22:57.416
Let's say Clarence owed you $100,000,
and he's late.

22:57.480 --> 22:59.077
Where would you go looking?

22:59.149 --> 23:02.957
You saying, like, hypocritically"
if he really owed me this money?

23:03.032 --> 23:06.904
We're saying right now
you're our only suspect.

23:06.978 --> 23:10.982
I guess I'd check Leo's
up on 25th and Lex. Barbershop.

23:11.053 --> 23:15.342
They shoot dice in the back room.
Clarence hangs out, looks to roll the winners.

23:27.898 --> 23:30.076
I can't believe
I didn't bring a fresh change of clothes.

23:30.145 --> 23:32.223
You'll stop home in the morning.

23:32.294 --> 23:35.532
Yeah. It's just, you know,
as much as we planned this all out.

23:35.599 --> 23:38.509
- You know what I mean?
- Yeah, I know.

23:38.583 --> 23:41.011
- Adrianne?
- Yeah?

23:41.086 --> 23:44.324
You know you got me hooked on
that fresh pasta stuff now?

23:44.391 --> 23:48.111
- I eat the, uh, boxed stuff, it tastes like cardboard.
- Oh, it's so much better.

23:48.177 --> 23:53.309
- Yeah.
- Okay, we need two cooking pots and one skillet.

23:53.375 --> 23:56.230
- You real hungry?
- Not real.

23:56.295 --> 23:59.205
Me neither.

23:59.279 --> 24:01.587
You think we should hold off
cooking until we're hungry?

24:01.654 --> 24:03.513
Yeah, maybe we should,
you know?

24:03.579 --> 24:06.237
That's the beauty of eating at home.
You eat when you want to eat, right?

24:06.306 --> 24:09.698
Yeah. It's not like we can't
get a later reservation.

24:09.772 --> 24:12.561
That's right.
You know, no reservations, no bad tables.

24:12.627 --> 24:16.314
No tipping.

24:19.398 --> 24:22.723
- James, you want to do the other thing first?
- Do you?

24:23.825 --> 24:27.829
- Yeah.
- I do if you do.

24:29.087 --> 24:31.942
- Yeah.
- All right.

24:44.328 --> 24:47.336
- Mm.
- You want to come into the bedroom?

24:47.409 --> 24:50.767
Yeah, I do. It's just that, uh,
old Maurice is in there, right?

24:50.842 --> 24:52.855
I took the dog to my mom's house.

24:52.928 --> 24:54.941
Oh, that's why I don't
hear him yapping, huh?

24:55.014 --> 24:57.891
That's when he bumps into walls.

25:01.815 --> 25:05.020
Here we are.

25:29.827 --> 25:31.687
- James?
- Yeah?

25:31.752 --> 25:35.022
- Will you unhook my bra?
- Is that a front-loader or a back-loader?

25:56.491 --> 25:59.018
- Ow!
- Sorry. That's my belt buckle.

26:15.390 --> 26:17.534
- Hey, hey!
- Hey, James.

26:21.134 --> 26:23.474
- So what's new?
- We had a great time.

26:23.540 --> 26:26.034
Yeah, huh?

26:26.107 --> 26:28.930
- What do you say?
- This is some country, America, huh?

26:28.995 --> 26:30.723
- Good morning, James.
- Good morning.

26:30.791 --> 26:34.096
Bobby, we got a use on one of
the credit cards stolen from your D.O. A...

26:34.161 --> 26:36.174
in a casino in Atlantic City
about an hour ago.

26:36.246 --> 26:38.007
Andy's on standby at court right now.

26:38.075 --> 26:41.050
- You want to take a run down to the casinos with Bobby?
- Yeah, all right.

26:41.123 --> 26:44.198
B.C.I. Sent this photo over. I'll just fax it
ahead to the cops in Atlantic City, huh?

26:44.268 --> 26:46.510
Where are you
with your shot doctor?

26:46.578 --> 26:49.268
Oh. Uh, we're gonna go
up to that barber shop...

26:49.337 --> 26:51.832
see if we can locate this Clarence
supposed to have had the doctor's wallet.

26:51.904 --> 26:54.628
- You hear how the doctor's doing?
- His arm's gonna be all right.

26:54.696 --> 26:57.671
Yeah. Now his only problem
is that battle-ax he's got for a wife.

27:03.135 --> 27:04.995
- Hey, Bobby?
- Mm-hmm?

27:05.060 --> 27:09.064
If you, um, pass a roulette wheel,
would you put five bucks on 22?

27:09.135 --> 27:12.756
And if that wins, bet half back on eight.

27:19.852 --> 27:22.193
- Hi, Donna.
- Morning.

27:22.258 --> 27:24.720
- Morning, James. Morning, everyone.
- Morning.

27:24.793 --> 27:26.970
- Morning.
- Morning.

27:27.039 --> 27:29.730
Great day, huh?

27:34.676 --> 27:36.820
- Morning.
- Morning.

27:36.889 --> 27:40.762
- You're putting your coat on.
- Yeah. I'm going down to Atlantic City with Bobby.

27:40.836 --> 27:43.658
- Is that right?
- Yeah. We're going to look for this perp.

27:43.724 --> 27:48.111
- What time will you be back?
- Uh...

27:48.184 --> 27:51.673
We got to talk to all these people at the
casino. You know, pass this guy's picture around.

27:51.745 --> 27:54.371
We should be back
this afternoon sometime.

27:54.441 --> 27:58.478
- I'll see you later, all right?
- See you later.

27:58.548 --> 28:00.856
- I'll meet you outside.
- Yeah, Bobby.

28:22.998 --> 28:24.857
We'll see if this Clarence is inside.

28:24.923 --> 28:28.063
- You guys cover the rear exit.
- Okay.

28:37.276 --> 28:41.116
- All right.
- Come on.

28:44.400 --> 28:47.889
- Oh, thriving business.
- Here we go.

28:51.779 --> 28:54.787
- Detectives.
- Okay, just keep your hands where I can see them.

28:54.859 --> 28:57.802
We're just looking for our guy.
Nothing to get excited about.

28:57.876 --> 29:02.558
I don't see him. Kenny said Clarence was
about 25. And these guys are too old.

29:02.625 --> 29:05.633
Anybody know where
we can find Clarence?

29:08.272 --> 29:12.856
- What a surprise.
- We're Detectives Medavoy and Russell from the 15th Squad.

29:12.925 --> 29:15.233
There's something in it,
any help on a guy named Clarence.

29:20.047 --> 29:23.187
You come in here hassling people
and you expect them to cooperate back?

29:23.256 --> 29:26.331
- Well, that's an interesting point.
- We'll take it up with our boss.

29:26.401 --> 29:29.541
Hey. Hey, don't you have some
traffic tickets to pass out?

29:29.609 --> 29:33.514
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Yo, yo. Let me talk to you a minute.

29:33.588 --> 29:37.790
- Look, here, I'm Norval Stevens. I don't mean you no disrespect.
- Well, what's going on, Norval?

29:37.856 --> 29:41.795
Well, I didn't want to establish an atmosphere.
You know, those other people watching.

29:41.867 --> 29:44.427
- You know where Clarence is at?
- Well, I know where a lot of people are.

29:44.498 --> 29:49.245
- What are you looking for?
- Uh, I hold some bets once in a while...

29:49.311 --> 29:52.319
- a friendly thing, TV games only.
- Oh, you're a bookmaker.

29:52.391 --> 29:55.498
Vice took my car last week behind some
bet slips in the glove compartment...

29:55.567 --> 29:58.258
- and some cough medicine.
- Oh, it's a sad story, Norval.

29:58.327 --> 30:02.299
My ride's a '93 DeVille Concourse...

30:02.370 --> 30:04.832
sea mist green with the burnt
cappuccino leather.

30:04.905 --> 30:08.712
- Have the V.I.N. Number.
- So you want your car back, and we want Clarence.

30:08.787 --> 30:14.016
Clarence gets his, uh, methadone,
97 th and Amsterdam, 3:00 pickup.

30:14.082 --> 30:17.319
- We'll need you to come with us, pick him out.
- Anonymous, right?

30:17.386 --> 30:21.970
Yeah. Y-You walk after you point him out
and-and before we grab him up.

30:22.039 --> 30:26.043
- That's gonna get me my car?
- If the victims I.D. Him in a lineup, Norval...

30:26.114 --> 30:28.006
we'll try to get Vice
to give you your car back.

30:28.071 --> 30:31.113
That cough medicine, that's prescription.
I don't know how that label got scraped off.

30:31.183 --> 30:33.524
Yeah, come on.
Come on. This way.

30:38.980 --> 30:41.058
We're gonna take you upstairs
to the monitor room.

30:41.130 --> 30:43.526
Every square foot in the casino
is covered with cameras.

30:43.601 --> 30:46.905
- Yeah, we appreciate that.
- So that wasn't even close, huh? Lieu's play on the roulette?

30:46.970 --> 30:49.344
Nah. Stack, this buddy of mine,
he plays the Brooklyn number every day.

30:49.408 --> 30:51.870
Whatever came out, you know,
the number could've been 336...

30:51.943 --> 30:54.820
he's going like, Oh, I had 492,"
you know, like he just missed it.

30:54.895 --> 30:57.772
What's this?
What's that over there? Everywhere!

30:57.847 --> 30:59.992
That's our picture of Fulmer.
What's it doing out in public view?

31:00.061 --> 31:02.402
What? You figured it'd make it a fair fight?
Eliminate the element of surprise?

31:02.468 --> 31:05.061
- Jerry.
- Yes, sir?

31:05.131 --> 31:09.518
Eighty-six all these flyers. We specifically
instructed do not post in public access area.

31:09.591 --> 31:13.146
Hang on.
Northeast quadrant?

31:14.500 --> 31:17.322
May be able to make it up to you.
Got a possible sighting.

31:17.388 --> 31:19.761
All right.

31:27.527 --> 31:29.442
- Hey, there he is.
- How many doors in there?

31:29.517 --> 31:31.431
Just this one.

31:41.131 --> 31:43.309
- Police! Don't move, Clyde!
- Hey, stay away from me!

31:43.378 --> 31:45.238
- Don't shoot me.
- I'm out of here.

31:45.303 --> 31:47.676
- I'm out of here or this guy's dead!
- Drop that knife, Clyde!

31:47.742 --> 31:50.137
Stay away from me!
I'll slit his throat!

31:50.212 --> 31:52.707
- I've got a heart condition.
- Don't you hurt this man!

31:52.780 --> 31:54.640
- Come on.
- Hey!

31:54.705 --> 31:57.330
- We got a situation coming onto the floor.
- Hey, get out of the way!

31:57.399 --> 31:59.675
Police! Everybody out of the way!

31:59.742 --> 32:02.335
- Move!
- Don't take him out here!

32:02.406 --> 32:04.386
I got a lot of problems if you
take him out on the premises!

32:04.459 --> 32:07.248
This guy is not getting out of here!
Go, James!

32:07.315 --> 32:10.619
- Clyde, get down.
- Stay! Hey, man, stay back!

32:10.683 --> 32:14.370
- Hey, stay away from me! Hey!
- Right here. This is where it stops, Clyde.

32:14.438 --> 32:16.418
- Everything stops right here.
- Then this guy is dead.

32:16.492 --> 32:19.796
You're not getting out this door. You want to
see us whack you without whacking him?

32:19.860 --> 32:22.005
That's what we're gonna do.
But you will not get out ofhere.

32:22.074 --> 32:26.242
- You-You dare not shoot me!
- Oh, yeah, we dare, Clyde! Believe that!

32:26.310 --> 32:31.922
Honest to God! Clyde, listen to me. Drop
the knife, or I am gonna drop you right now.

32:37.604 --> 32:40.032
Jay! Jay and Dave
made me do this!

32:40.106 --> 32:43.793
- Talk show guys?
- Yeah! Her punishment was ordained!

32:43.861 --> 32:46.071
- Yeah?
- They ordained it!

32:46.139 --> 32:51.040
Yeah, babe. We'll see what's ordained
for you in New York. Thanks.

33:00.115 --> 33:02.992
Dave wanted his name on the wall.
And then Jay did too.

33:03.067 --> 33:05.245
Well, you know, Jay and Dave,
they always compete.

33:05.313 --> 33:08.835
- Yeah. They wanted it written in her blood.
- Hey, Clyde, shut up.

33:08.906 --> 33:11.597
James, put this guy in an interview room.
I'll run this through the lieutenant.

33:11.666 --> 33:15.321
- If you happen to see Adrianne, let her know we're back?
- Yeah. Right.

33:15.389 --> 33:17.369
What's that guy like?

33:17.442 --> 33:20.614
Well, he was acting pretty sane until
he couldn't escape from that casino.

33:20.683 --> 33:22.860
Then he started sounding
like he's from Mars.

33:22.929 --> 33:26.801
So you figure that psycho stuff, writing on
the wall with her blood, that was all bogus?

33:26.876 --> 33:29.851
- Oh, yeah. Hey, Andy.
- Those humps never got to my case.

33:29.924 --> 33:32.451
So you and Martinez
collared up on the guy?

33:32.522 --> 33:35.312
Yeah. He was using one
of the D.O.A.'s credit cards in the casino.

33:35.378 --> 33:37.774
- We go to grab him up, he starts coming on wacky.
- Why not? He makes it...

33:37.849 --> 33:40.956
into one of them minimum security houses,
some orderly leaves the door unlocked...

33:41.026 --> 33:45.096
he's back on the streets
getting high and filleting his dates.

33:45.165 --> 33:48.523
- Call Puterbaugh, apologize for the inconvenience.
- I gotta take a piss.

33:48.598 --> 33:51.540
See if I can move Clyde
on the bright side of going to the joint.

33:51.614 --> 33:55.399
- Oh, yeah, boss, 22 on the roulette?
- No good?

33:58.512 --> 34:02.100
- You want to work this with me?
- Eh, you already built a rapport.

34:03.839 --> 34:06.464
- Hey.
- Hi.

34:06.534 --> 34:09.061
- Is 1 open, Donna?
- Yeah.

34:09.134 --> 34:11.562
Right through here.

34:11.636 --> 34:13.813
That's Clarence Rutherford.
Might be our stickup guy.

34:13.882 --> 34:16.572
We're gonna get some fillers,
put him in a lineup for that doctor.

34:16.641 --> 34:20.646
You've gotten four phone calls from a Norval
Stevens about getting a car out of impound?

34:20.716 --> 34:23.178
He's a bookmaker gave us this guy.
Vice took his Caddy.

34:23.251 --> 34:25.264
- If the guy's right, we're gonna get it back.
- Okay.

34:27.743 --> 34:29.723
I know what Garth Brooks told me.

34:29.797 --> 34:32.652
It's channeled through Jay. Who's that?

34:32.717 --> 34:34.697
- Clyde-
- Clyde who?

34:34.771 --> 34:38.458
Hey! Look, I don't know
what you read in the papers...

34:38.525 --> 34:40.636
but this crazy man defense,
people aren't buying it anymore.

34:40.706 --> 34:42.752
I am not crazy!

34:42.824 --> 34:44.804
My devils told me it was preordained.

34:44.877 --> 34:48.532
- So your devils work through Jay and Dave?
- Yeah. Yeah.

34:48.600 --> 34:50.710
Actually, those are the cases
the prosecutors, they work harder on.

34:50.782 --> 34:53.659
'Cause none of'em wants to be the one
that loses to an insanity plea.

34:53.733 --> 34:55.777
That girl insulted Travis Tritt.

34:55.851 --> 34:59.057
Jay and Dave told me
to take her entrails to the well.

34:59.124 --> 35:03.806
Yeah, right.
See, here's the thing, Clyde.

35:03.873 --> 35:06.498
I don't see any psycho hospitalizations
here on your rap sheet.

35:06.568 --> 35:10.473
On the other hand, what I do see are four collars
for narcotics possession and one for menacing.

35:10.547 --> 35:13.851
Now, I make you for a guy
with some habits and a temper.

35:13.916 --> 35:17.340
Maybe he got the mix wrong
on a little coke, some Ecstasy...

35:17.413 --> 35:20.071
while he was out partying,
something happened he never meant.

35:20.140 --> 35:22.055
That's a manslaughter beef
that we're talking about.

35:22.130 --> 35:26.682
I gutted her
becauseJay ordered me to.

35:26.751 --> 35:30.591
All this crazy-man stuff,
you're still confessing to the crime.

35:30.665 --> 35:33.542
They throw out the craziness,
and all you are left with is a confession.

35:33.617 --> 35:37.304
My devils told me to kill her.

35:37.371 --> 35:41.890
I'd make a statement explaining the circumstances
there, Clyde. The drugs, they overcame me.

35:41.959 --> 35:45.996
Take a shot at five years in the joint
with guys who don't hear voices.

35:46.066 --> 35:48.790
Now, maybe that's just me.

35:48.858 --> 35:51.713
Jay, Dave...

35:54.120 --> 35:57.325
- and Ted Koppel.
- No Tom Snyder?

35:57.393 --> 35:59.373
No.

36:00.409 --> 36:02.006
Okay.

36:06.698 --> 36:08.558
- James, uh-
- Yeah?

36:08.623 --> 36:11.019
Let Andy know what's going on. Tell him
we're taking this phony down to holding.

36:11.094 --> 36:12.789
Okay.

36:12.859 --> 36:15.682
- Clyde, come on. We're gonna do it your way. Come on.
- In there?

36:15.747 --> 36:18.405
No. We're gonna print you
and take you downstairs.

36:20.527 --> 36:22.573
Which one's for transport to Bellevue?

36:22.645 --> 36:26.517
- Uh, the last one on the right.
- Down here, Clyde.

36:26.592 --> 36:30.115
- With who?
- Maybe Napoleon. Ask him.

36:30.186 --> 36:32.943
Get in.
Play nice.

36:41.800 --> 36:43.715
Oh, crap.

36:48.411 --> 36:52.415
Hi. Hello.
Who are you?

36:52.485 --> 36:54.345
I don't want to talk.

36:54.410 --> 36:56.488
- I'm Andy.
- Yeah, good.

36:56.561 --> 37:00.762
Can you honestly tell me the difference
between cow meat and man meat?

37:00.828 --> 37:03.585
Don't get stupid with me, man.

37:05.063 --> 37:07.788
- How many did you get?
- How many what?

37:07.855 --> 37:11.410
- I don't know. You tell me.
- Shut up, all right!

37:11.480 --> 37:15.200
You hit me in the face as hard as you can
and, uh, and I'll bite you with my teeth.

37:15.267 --> 37:18.822
You bite me with your teeth
and I'll knock your teeth down your throat!

37:18.893 --> 37:23.181
Hey, let's both dump on the floor, huh? Huh?

37:23.256 --> 37:26.079
- Guard!
- Come on. Give me a free shot in the face...

37:26.144 --> 37:29.929
- and I'll bite your arm off, huh?
- Hey! Hey!

37:29.995 --> 37:34.283
Now, here, okay, this is- this is
you hitting me. And now here comes me!

37:34.358 --> 37:37.716
Hey, get the hell
away from me! Hey! Hey!

37:37.792 --> 37:40.067
- Hey! Stop!
- Hey, back off!

37:40.134 --> 37:43.208
- Point that finger at me!
- You got a damn cannibal in here, man!

37:43.279 --> 37:45.652
Hey, back off!
Back off! Get down!

37:45.717 --> 37:50.301
Well, why don't you sickJay and Dave on him?
Huh? Bring on your boys!

37:50.370 --> 37:51.868
Look, can you get me a five-year bit?

37:51.942 --> 37:54.633
- I can get you a conversation with the D.A.
- Well, get me one!

37:54.701 --> 37:56.714
You better go! Back off!

37:56.787 --> 37:58.679
Hey!

38:07.665 --> 38:09.874
Hey, who's hungry?

38:12.541 --> 38:14.936
- Hey, James.
- Hey, Adrianne.

38:15.012 --> 38:16.871
I heard you guys giving
the straight story.

38:16.937 --> 38:20.361
Yeah. The D.A. Just finished up with him.
Me and Bobby are doing our fives.

38:20.434 --> 38:23.759
Mm. James, I hope I didn't convey
a wrong impression before...

38:23.835 --> 38:25.783
when you were leaving
for Atlantic City.

38:25.857 --> 38:30.244
- You sounded a little strict.
- Yeah, well, my act is when I'm feeling so happy...

38:30.317 --> 38:34.036
- I worry something's gonna reach out and take it away.
- You shouldn't worry like that.

38:34.104 --> 38:36.215
I worry about highway conditions,
everything else.

38:36.286 --> 38:39.644
And I could also sound like I'm wanting you
to account for your whereabouts.

38:39.719 --> 38:42.092
Anyways, uh, it was a misunderstanding.

38:42.157 --> 38:44.685
The worst thing I could do
if I start worrying about everything...

38:44.756 --> 38:49.023
is I could create exactly what I want to
avoid by making you feel claustrophobic.

38:49.088 --> 38:51.035
It's growing pains, that's all.

38:51.109 --> 38:54.731
I mean, it's a process of getting to
know each other, know what I mean?

38:54.799 --> 38:57.140
Yeah.

38:58.328 --> 39:01.785
So, what time do you feel
you'll be going home?

39:02.853 --> 39:04.745
L- I don't know. Um...

39:04.811 --> 39:08.235
Let me just find Bobby.
I'll go over those fives again. All right?

39:08.308 --> 39:10.223
Okay.

39:14.404 --> 39:17.992
- Number three.
And where do you recognize him from?

39:18.062 --> 39:21.683
He's one of the sons ofbitches
who nearly destroyed my life.

39:21.752 --> 39:25.307
Uh, you need to say the time and location
where he nearly did this.

39:25.378 --> 39:30.827
Yesterday morning, he yanked me out of my car
before the other one shot me in the shoulder...

39:30.897 --> 39:35.032
and nearly caused massive nerve damage
which could have deprived me of my livelihood.

39:35.100 --> 39:37.277
Which happened where?

39:37.346 --> 39:40.933
In front of Miss Epton's apartment.

39:41.004 --> 39:45.325
We've got a hit, Ray. Take him in
and start the paperwork. The others can relax.

39:45.399 --> 39:48.987
All right. This way.

39:50.694 --> 39:53.637
- Thanks for your cooperation, Doctor.
- Was he in there?

39:53.710 --> 39:56.980
One of the son of a bitches was. The
son of a bitch who yanked me from the car.

39:57.047 --> 40:00.919
- You son of a bitch!
- You scream like a little girl.

40:00.994 --> 40:03.871
Darnell shot you to get loose
from you begging at his ankle!

40:03.945 --> 40:06.603
Have a nice bus ride, Clarence.

40:06.672 --> 40:08.587
Will you be able to
capture the other one?

40:08.662 --> 40:12.054
- Yeah. Clarence isn't too shy about giving up his name.
- Clarence didn't have the gun?

40:12.128 --> 40:14.305
- No. It was the other S.O.B.
- All right, Siddy. Okay.

40:14.373 --> 40:16.288
We'll call you if we need
you for another lineup.

40:16.363 --> 40:21.198
Yeah. And, uh, we're glad your worst fears
weren't realized- losing the use of your hand.

40:21.272 --> 40:25.112
I would say that being shot, Detective,
was sufficiently traumatic.

40:25.187 --> 40:28.491
That and knowing that some S.O.B.
Is driving around in my Mercedes.

40:28.556 --> 40:30.864
Well, the woods are full of S.O.B.'s.

40:30.931 --> 40:34.420
If we need to reach you, it'd be easier if we
didn't have to go through your phone service.

40:34.492 --> 40:37.281
- You can use my number.
- Do you have my number in Scarsdale?

40:37.348 --> 40:40.487
- Uh, no. We'll need that.
- Why would they need the number in Scarsdale?

40:40.557 --> 40:43.182
Dale, we'll discuss
the logistics of this later.

40:43.251 --> 40:46.971
You know, you can call us and-and let us know
what number you want us to use.

40:47.038 --> 40:49.631
Oh, no, no, no.
We're gonna let you know right now.

40:49.701 --> 40:52.490
Why would they need the number
in Scarsdale, Sid, you son of a bitch?

40:52.557 --> 40:54.569
Detectives, thank you very much.
Appreciate it.

40:54.643 --> 40:56.721
- Our pleasure.
- Dale, I told you...

40:56.792 --> 40:59.220
You wouldn't believe
the barracuda this guy's going back to.

40:59.295 --> 41:02.150
The secretary might not know it yet,
but today's her lucky day.

41:02.214 --> 41:05.485
- Ow! Dale, now, sweetheart, come on.
- Who's having the party?

41:05.551 --> 41:08.559
Oh, our guy that got shot in a stickup,
you know, that doctor.

41:08.632 --> 41:12.505
His, uh, secretary just found out
they're not gonna be an item.

41:13.477 --> 41:17.032
- Oh! Hey!
- Hey.

41:17.102 --> 41:20.340
- Bobby says you should go up for the Oscar.
- Ah, the hungry inmate.

41:20.408 --> 41:23.033
- What?
- Andy moved our perp off of playing nuts.

41:23.103 --> 41:27.851
- Oh, yeah?
- Andy's in the cell with the guy playing a wacko cannibal.

41:27.916 --> 41:30.509
The guy is climbing the bars
to give up his loony act.

41:30.579 --> 41:33.620
- He's yelling to make a deal with the D.A.
- So, he's in with the D. A...

41:33.692 --> 41:36.481
- finding out what getting eaten alive is all about.
- Oh, yeah.

41:36.548 --> 41:40.333
L- I moved a guy once. He was conning
homely women. I'm in a cell with him.

41:40.398 --> 41:43.220
He makes me for another grifter.
Gives up his scam to me.

41:43.286 --> 41:47.290
I remember that. The guy
with the big thing on his head, right?

41:47.360 --> 41:49.701
- Yeah.
- Yeah. Remember, Adrianne?

41:49.767 --> 41:52.163
Yeah, the black box guy.

41:56.602 --> 41:59.577
- Anyways, yeah.
- Yeah.

42:02.826 --> 42:05.649
Uh. Andy, thank Sylvia
for that casserole, will you?

42:05.714 --> 42:08.591
Oh, yeah. She said drop off the dish
whenever you're done.

42:08.666 --> 42:10.526
Uh, you know, I could go up
and get it right now, if you want.

42:10.591 --> 42:14.016
Mm-mmm. No rush. You can
drop it off tomorrow in yourjammies.

42:14.089 --> 42:18.738
- Night, all.
- Greg, remember, we have to reach out to Vice tomorrow.

42:18.805 --> 42:21.200
Oh, yeah. Get that Norval
his car back. That's right.

42:21.276 --> 42:23.354
- Good night, Diane.
- Good night.

42:25.126 --> 42:26.986
- I didn't mean to hurry you.
- Oh, you didn't hurry me.

42:27.052 --> 42:29.480
Hey, uh, Bobby, the boss said
tomorrow's good for the fives, right?

42:29.554 --> 42:31.414
Oh, yeah. Definitely.

42:31.479 --> 42:33.394
See? I was all done.
