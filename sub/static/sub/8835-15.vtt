WEBVTT

01:25.128 --> 01:26.463
CAN I GALLOP HIM?

01:26.629 --> 01:28.715
Laura: No. YOU BE
CAREFUL, NELLIE OLESON.

01:28.882 --> 01:31.718
I DON'T WANT HIM
TO GET ALL WINDED.

01:31.885 --> 01:33.219
[PONY SNORTS]

01:42.020 --> 01:44.230
Charles: LAURA, COME ON.
TIME To Go.

01:44.397 --> 01:46.483
THAT'S ENOUGH.
PA'S READY TO GO.

01:46.649 --> 01:48.735
JUST ONE MORE TIME.

01:48.902 --> 01:51.112
Laura: No.
NOW, GET OFF.

01:52.155 --> 01:53.698
YOU OUGHT TO GET
A SADDLE FOR HIM.

01:53.865 --> 01:55.158
I DON'T NEED ONE.

01:55.325 --> 01:57.327
IF HE WAS MINE, I'D
GET HIM A SADDLE.

01:57.494 --> 01:58.745
WELL, HE ISN'T YOURS.

01:58.912 --> 02:00.914
I WISH HE WAS. WOULD
YOU LEND HIM TO ME?

02:01.080 --> 02:02.165
NO.

02:02.332 --> 02:03.416
WHY NOT?

02:03.583 --> 02:05.084
I'D LET YOU PLAY
WITH MY CHINA DOLL.

02:05.251 --> 02:06.628
LEND HIM TO ME
FOR A WEEK,

02:06.795 --> 02:07.962
AND I'LL LET
YOU PLAY

02:08.129 --> 02:09.506
WITH MY CHINA
DOLL ALL THAT TIME.

02:09.672 --> 02:10.673
NO!

02:10.840 --> 02:12.467
I'LL BUY HIM
FROM YOU.

02:12.634 --> 02:14.344
HE'S NOT FOR SALE.

02:14.511 --> 02:17.555
YOU'D BUY HIM FOR
ME, WOULDN'T YOU?

02:17.722 --> 02:18.848
THE PONY,

02:19.015 --> 02:20.600
IF I TOLD YOU HOW
MUCH I WANTED HIM?

02:20.767 --> 02:22.644
I DON'T KNOW.
NOW, I, UH...

02:22.811 --> 02:23.770
PLEASE.

02:23.937 --> 02:25.605
I PROMISE I WON'T
ASK FOR ANOTHER

02:25.772 --> 02:27.899
SINGLE, SOLITARY
THING FOR CHRISTMAS

02:28.066 --> 02:31.027
IF YOU BUY ME BUNNY.

02:31.194 --> 02:33.488
WELL, LAURA, WILL YOU
TAKE $5.00 FOR HIM?

02:33.655 --> 02:35.240
HE'S NOT FOR SALE.

02:35.406 --> 02:37.992
Nellie: YOU CAN'T SAY THAT.
ONLY YOUR PA CAN SAY THAT.

02:38.159 --> 02:41.412
HE'S FOR SALE,
ISN'T HE, MR. INGALLS?

02:41.579 --> 02:43.498
WELL, I'M AFRAID NOT,
NELLIE. THAT'S LAURA'S PONY.

02:43.665 --> 02:45.250
IF SHE DOESN'T WANT
TO SELL HIM,

02:45.416 --> 02:48.044
SHE DOESN'T
HAVE TO SELL HIM.

02:50.630 --> 02:52.841
YOU DON'T EVEN
HAVE A SADDLE.

02:59.472 --> 03:01.140
I HATE THAT
NELLIE OLESON.

03:01.307 --> 03:04.227
LAURA, DON'T SAY "HATE."
AND DON'T EVEN THINK HATE.

03:04.394 --> 03:06.354
NOW, YOU MAY BE ANGRY,
BUT TRY TO UNDERSTAND.

03:06.521 --> 03:09.899
I'M SURE NELLIE MUST HAVE
SOME FINE QUALITIES IN HER.

03:10.066 --> 03:11.442
YOUR MOTHER'S RIGHT.

03:11.609 --> 03:14.028
ON THE WAY HOME, WE'LL
TRY TO THINK OF ONE.

03:14.195 --> 03:16.656
HA HA!

03:21.119 --> 03:23.246
OOH! OOH! AGAIN!

03:23.413 --> 03:24.622
AGAIN.

03:24.789 --> 03:25.999
YEAH!

03:26.165 --> 03:28.585
IT'S A GOOD THING WE RAN
INTO NELLIE OLESON TODAY

03:28.751 --> 03:30.336
OR WE MIGHT HAVE FORGOTTEN
ABOUT CHRISTMAS ALTOGETHER.

03:30.503 --> 03:31.838
Laura: NOT ME.

03:32.005 --> 03:33.381
Mary:
NOR ME EITHER.

03:33.548 --> 03:34.883
NOT ME EITHER!

03:35.049 --> 03:36.843
OH. BUT WHAT IF WE
DID FORGET?

03:37.010 --> 03:38.845
YOU THINK SANTA CLAUS
WOULD COME ALL THE WAY DOWN

03:39.012 --> 03:41.180
FROM THE NORTH POLE
FOR CHRISTMAS ANYWAY?

03:41.347 --> 03:44.100
WHAT'S CHRISTMAS?

03:44.267 --> 03:45.727
"WHAT'S CHRISTMAS?"

03:45.894 --> 03:47.979
WELL, THAT'S
A VERY GOOD QUESTION.

03:48.146 --> 03:52.609
HERE. LET'S SEE
IF I CAN SHOW YOU.

03:52.775 --> 03:53.735
THERE.

03:53.902 --> 03:55.820
NOW, YOU SEE
THAT STAR UP THERE?

03:55.987 --> 03:57.280
THE REAL BIG ONE?

03:57.447 --> 04:00.325
WELL, A LONG, LONG TIME AGO,

04:00.491 --> 04:02.702
A STAR LIKE THAT
APPEARED IN THE SKY.

04:02.869 --> 04:06.331
EXCEPT IT WAS MUCH, MUCH
BIGGER AND MUCH BRIGHTER.

04:06.497 --> 04:08.249
NOW, LOTS
OF PEOPLE SAW IT,

04:08.416 --> 04:11.294
BUT ONLY A FEW PEOPLE
KNEW WHAT IT MEANT:

04:11.461 --> 04:15.214
SOME SHEPHERDS,
3 KINGS, 3 WISE MEN.

04:15.381 --> 04:18.760
AND THEY FOLLOWED THAT STAR
A LONG, LONG WAY.

04:18.927 --> 04:20.929
THEY FINALLY
CAME TO A MANGER.

04:21.095 --> 04:23.097
AND YOU KNOW
WHAT THEY FOUND?

04:23.264 --> 04:25.224
A BABY.

04:25.391 --> 04:26.893
BABY JESUS.

04:27.060 --> 04:28.353
AND HE WAS GOD'S SON.

04:28.519 --> 04:30.355
AND GOD GAVE HIM
TO THE WORLD

04:30.521 --> 04:32.523
BECAUSE HE LOVED US.

04:32.690 --> 04:36.694
SO, CHRISTMAS IS
THE BABY JESUS' BIRTHDAY.

04:36.861 --> 04:39.238
Caroline: AND NOW,
YOUNG LADY,

04:39.405 --> 04:40.865
IT'S TIME
FOR DREAM LAND.

04:41.032 --> 04:42.951
GIVE ME MY KISS.

04:44.744 --> 04:47.956
MMM...GOOD NIGHT,
DARLING.

04:57.131 --> 04:59.926
THIS IS OUR
FIRST CHRISTMAS HERE.

05:00.093 --> 05:01.761
I KNOW THAT.

05:01.928 --> 05:04.681
AND WE HAVE TO GET
SOMETHING SPECIAL

05:04.847 --> 05:06.933
FOR MA AND PA.

05:07.100 --> 05:09.936
I DON'T EVEN
KNOW WHAT THEY WANT.

05:10.103 --> 05:12.313
DO YOU?

05:12.480 --> 05:16.442
TOMORROW I'M GONNA
FIND OUT WHAT MA WANTS.

05:25.201 --> 05:26.786
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

05:26.953 --> 05:28.997
COUNTING.

05:36.462 --> 05:38.464
HOW MUCH
DO YOU HAVE?

05:38.631 --> 05:40.842
I'M NOT GONNA TELL.

05:41.009 --> 05:43.136
THEN I WON'T.

05:44.595 --> 05:46.472
I DON'T HAVE MUCH.

05:46.639 --> 05:49.017
NEITHER DO I.

06:04.907 --> 06:06.284
IT'S COLD TONIGHT.

06:06.451 --> 06:07.827
MMM, THAT IT IS.

06:07.994 --> 06:09.620
DO YOU MIND GETTING
SOME MORE WOOD?

06:09.787 --> 06:11.831
I'LL GET SOME RIGHT NOW.

06:43.654 --> 06:46.783
MA, WHAT CAN I GET
PA FOR CHRISTMAS?

06:46.949 --> 06:50.286
I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M
GONNA GIVE HIM MYSELF.

06:50.453 --> 06:51.871
I'M SURE THAT HE'LL LIKE

06:52.038 --> 06:53.831
WHATEVER YOU FINALLY
GIVE HIM.

06:53.998 --> 06:56.125
IT'S GOT TO BE SPECIAL.

06:56.292 --> 06:58.544
THIS IS OUR FIRST
CHRISTMAS HERE.

06:58.711 --> 07:00.713
WELL, ONE THING
IS CERTAIN.

07:00.880 --> 07:02.673
WE DON'T HAVE MONEY
TO BUY PRESENTS.

07:02.840 --> 07:04.509
IF IT'S GOING TO BE
SPECIAL, WE'RE GOING

07:04.675 --> 07:06.886
TO HAVE TO MAKE IT
THAT WAY OURSELVES.

07:23.319 --> 07:25.571
YOU MEAN YOU DON'T
HAVE ANY IDEAS AT ALL?

07:25.738 --> 07:27.865
I'M AFRAID NOT,
HALF-PINT.

07:28.032 --> 07:30.743
YOUR MA'S NOT ONE
FOR ASKING FOR THINGS.

07:30.910 --> 07:32.328
I'VE BEEN SCROUNGING
AROUND IN MY HEAD,

07:32.495 --> 07:33.746
TRYING TO COME UP
WITH SOMETHING.

07:33.913 --> 07:35.748
I JUST KEEP COMING UP
EMPTY-HANDED.

07:35.915 --> 07:39.168
BUT I WANT TO GIVE
HER SOMETHING.

07:39.335 --> 07:42.797
I KNOW YOU DO. SO DO I.

07:45.258 --> 07:47.593
HOW DID YOU LEARN TO
MAKE A FISH TRAP, PA?

07:47.760 --> 07:50.096
HMM, JUST KIND OF
PICKED IT UP.

07:50.263 --> 07:51.848
HAVING TO DO IT FOR
YOURSELF IS THE BEST

07:52.014 --> 07:53.349
TEACHER THERE IS.

07:53.516 --> 07:54.809
COME ON. DON'T FRET.

07:54.976 --> 07:56.686
WE'LL THINK OF
SOMETHING FOR MA.

07:56.853 --> 07:58.187
[WIND]

07:58.354 --> 08:00.940
OH! IT'S GETTING COLD!

08:31.137 --> 08:34.223
Caroline: LAURA,
DON'T TOUCH IT.

08:34.390 --> 08:36.058
Charles: OH...

08:36.225 --> 08:38.728
LOOKIT HERE, CARRIE.

08:42.231 --> 08:43.816
OH, I'LL BE
RIGHT WITH YOU

08:43.983 --> 08:45.484
IN JUST
A MINUTE, MRS. INGALLS.

08:45.651 --> 08:47.528
IT'S ALL RIGHT.
THERE'S NO HURRY.

08:47.695 --> 08:50.281
TWO DOZEN TODAY,
ALL CANDLED.

08:57.955 --> 08:59.081
OH!

08:59.248 --> 09:01.250
HEH. PARDON ME.

09:01.417 --> 09:03.794
MY LANDS.
PRICES ARE GOING UP.

09:03.961 --> 09:06.255
WELL, OF COURSE,
MR. INGALLS.

09:06.422 --> 09:08.132
IT IS
THE CHRISTMAS SEASON.

09:08.299 --> 09:10.676
I ALMOST FORGOT.

09:10.843 --> 09:13.554
NOW, UH, HOW MANY
DID YOU SAY?

09:13.721 --> 09:15.181
TWO DOZEN, I SAID.

09:15.348 --> 09:16.766
ALL RIGHT.
I'LL MARK IT DOWN.

09:16.933 --> 09:18.684
HAS THE PRICE
OF EGGS GONE UP?

09:18.851 --> 09:21.604
WELL, OF COURSE NOT.

09:23.272 --> 09:24.523
NOW WE KNOW WHAT

09:24.690 --> 09:25.900
CHARLES DICKENS
HAD IN MIND

09:26.067 --> 09:27.568
WHEN HE WROTE ABOUT
EBENEZER SCROOGE.

09:27.735 --> 09:28.736
CHARLES!

09:28.903 --> 09:30.279
Mr. Oleson:
BE RIGHT WITH YOU, INGALLS.

09:30.446 --> 09:32.240
[STIFLED CHUCKLE]
TAKE YOUR TIME.

11:44.955 --> 11:47.166
I KNOW WHAT MA
WANTS FOR CHRISTMAS,

11:47.333 --> 11:49.085
BUT I DON'T KNOW
HOW TO GET IT FOR HER.

11:49.251 --> 11:51.170
I KNOW WHAT
PA NEEDS.

11:51.337 --> 11:52.338
WHAT?

11:52.505 --> 11:53.881
I'M NOT GONNA TELL.

11:54.048 --> 11:55.841
WELL, I'M NOT
GONNA TELL YOU

11:56.008 --> 11:58.094
WHAT MA WANTS, EITHER.

12:01.514 --> 12:03.849
WELL, WHAT DID YOU HAVE
IN MIND FOR TODAY, INGALLS?

12:04.016 --> 12:05.434
I NEED A MEASURE
OF GUNPOWDER,

12:05.601 --> 12:06.727
3 BARS OF LEAD.

12:06.894 --> 12:07.895
RIGHT.

12:08.062 --> 12:09.438
MY MISSIS HAS GOT
A LIST, TOO.

12:09.605 --> 12:10.898
YOU'LL HAVE TO CHECK
WITH HER.

12:11.065 --> 12:12.441
SAY, YOU WOULDN'T HAPPEN
TO KNOW WHERE I COULD

12:12.608 --> 12:14.318
PUT MY HANDS ON A SET OF
BUCKBOARD WHEELS, WOULD YOU?

12:14.485 --> 12:15.986
I HAVE A CUSTOMER
WHO NEEDS A SET,

12:16.153 --> 12:18.030
AND THERE AIN'T A WHEELWRIGHT
IN THE WHOLE COUNTY.

12:18.197 --> 12:20.032
WOULD HE SETTLE
FOR USED?

12:20.199 --> 12:21.367
WELL, HOW USED?

12:21.534 --> 12:23.202
PRETTY BAD RIGHT NOW,
BUT I COULD FIX THEM UP.

12:23.369 --> 12:24.787
I KNOW WHERE THERE'S
A WRECKED WAGON.

12:24.954 --> 12:26.205
YOU AIN'T
NO WHEELWRIGHT.

12:26.372 --> 12:28.290
WELL, I DON'T KNOW
IF I AM OR I'M NOT.

12:28.457 --> 12:30.376
I NEVER TRIED. HOW MUCH
YOU WILLING TO PAY?

12:30.543 --> 12:33.546
WELL, I'LL GO
$6.00 FOR THE LOT.

12:33.712 --> 12:35.131
NO. MM-MM.

12:35.297 --> 12:37.049
FOR USED WHEELS
OUT OF A WRECK?

12:37.216 --> 12:40.594
NO. $9.00 FOR WHEELS
IN REAL GOOD SHAPE.

12:40.761 --> 12:42.721
7.00.

12:42.888 --> 12:44.682
$8.50.

12:44.849 --> 12:47.059
DELIVERED
BEFORE CHRISTMAS?

12:47.226 --> 12:48.727
BEFORE CHRISTMAS,
AND YOU DON'T

12:48.894 --> 12:50.729
HAVE TO BUY THEM IF
YOU DON'T LIKE THEM.

12:50.896 --> 12:52.565
8.00.

12:52.731 --> 12:54.066
DONE.

12:54.233 --> 12:55.818
GOOD ENOUGH.

13:03.242 --> 13:04.493
Charles: WHOA!

13:04.660 --> 13:06.745
Caroline:
WHAT ON EARTH...

13:06.912 --> 13:10.416
I GOT A LITTLE
REPAIR WORK TO DO.

13:10.583 --> 13:12.960
WHAT FOR? WHAT IS THIS?

13:13.127 --> 13:15.880
NOW, CAROLINE, YOU
KNOW THAT CHRISTMAS

13:16.046 --> 13:18.257
IS NOT A TIME
TO ASK QUESTIONS.

13:32.229 --> 13:33.397
Mary: YOU Go HOME.

13:33.564 --> 13:35.483
I'VE GOT SOMETHING
IMPORTANT TO DO.

13:35.649 --> 13:36.942
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

13:37.109 --> 13:38.694
IT'S A SECRET.

13:38.861 --> 13:41.447
IT'S ALL RIGHT.
MA SAID I COULD.

13:41.614 --> 13:43.240
SAID YOU COULD WHAT?

13:43.407 --> 13:47.203
THAT'S FOR ME TO KNOW
AND YOU TO FIND OUT.

14:13.020 --> 14:16.565
YOU'RE MIGHTY SOLEMN
FOR A MONDAY AFTERNOON.

14:16.732 --> 14:18.817
PA, DO YOU KNOW
WHERE I CAN MAKE

14:18.984 --> 14:20.486
A LOT OF MONEY?

14:20.653 --> 14:22.613
I'M AFRAID NOT,
HALF-PINT.

14:22.780 --> 14:23.739
THAT'S A RIDDLE

14:23.906 --> 14:25.324
I HAVEN'T SOLVED
FOR MYSELF YET.

14:25.491 --> 14:26.825
WOULDN'T KNOW WHERE
TO START

14:26.992 --> 14:29.036
FOR A PRETTY
YOUNG GIRL LIKE YOU.

14:35.459 --> 14:37.294
AH, AH. DON'T--
DON'T TOUCH THAT.

14:37.461 --> 14:38.671
WHAT IS IT?

14:38.837 --> 14:40.881
WELL, IT'S JUST SOMETHING.
THAT'S WHAT IT IS.

14:41.048 --> 14:43.384
CHRISTMAS IS NOT A TIME
FOR PRYING AND POKING AROUND,

14:43.551 --> 14:45.344
NOR FOR ASKING QUESTIONS.

14:45.511 --> 14:47.638
IT SURE IS A TIME
FOR SECRETS.

14:47.805 --> 14:49.223
OH, THAT IT IS.

14:49.390 --> 14:51.559
NOW, WHY DON'T YOU SCOOT?

15:02.403 --> 15:03.654
GUESS WHAT!

15:03.821 --> 15:05.114
YOU SWALLOWED
A MOUSE?

15:05.281 --> 15:06.532
NO, SHE
SWALLOWED A PIG.

15:06.699 --> 15:08.701
MA, I'M SERIOUS.
I BET YOU CAN'T GUESS.

15:08.867 --> 15:11.245
YOU'RE RIGHT, DEAR.
I CAN'T. WHAT IS IT?

15:11.412 --> 15:12.955
Mary: I WENT
To MRS. WHIPPLE'S, MA,

15:13.122 --> 15:14.707
AND SHOWED HER HOW
I COULD SEW A SEAM

15:14.873 --> 15:16.792
AND DO FRENCH KNOTS,
CHAIN STITCHES,

15:16.959 --> 15:18.919
RUNNING STITCHES,
CROSS STITCHES--

15:19.086 --> 15:20.588
Charles:
HI, EVERYBODY.

15:20.754 --> 15:22.172
WELL, THAT'S
QUITE A WELCOME.

15:22.339 --> 15:23.549
OH, PA, THE MOST
WONDERFUL THING

15:23.716 --> 15:24.633
HAS HAPPENED.

15:24.800 --> 15:25.884
YOU'VE JUST
GOT TO SAY YES.

15:26.051 --> 15:27.595
YOU'VE JUST GOT TO
GIVE ME PERMISSION.

15:27.761 --> 15:29.179
WELL, MAYBE I WILL GIVE
YOU PERMISSION

15:29.346 --> 15:30.723

I THINK THERE

40:46.237 --> 40:47.571
MIGHT BE SOMETHING UNDER
THAT TREE FOR HALF-PINT.

40:47.738 --> 40:49.490
LET'S TAKE A LOOK.

40:52.076 --> 40:53.953
THIS LOOKS LIKE
A HALF-PINT PRESENT.

40:54.120 --> 40:56.914
PRETTY BIG FOR
A HALF-PINT SIZE PRESENT.

41:30.322 --> 41:33.534
I KNEW HOW MUCH
YOU WANTED ONE.

41:33.701 --> 41:35.995
I HAD A HARD TIME KEEPING
IT HIDDEN FROM YOU, TOO.

41:36.162 --> 41:38.747
THAT'S WHY I DIDN'T WANT
YOU SNEAKING IN THE BARN.

41:48.799 --> 41:52.136
LOOKS LIKE SOMEBODY
REALLY LIKES HER PRESENT.

41:58.225 --> 41:59.894
MERRY CHRISTMAS.

42:00.060 --> 42:02.980
MERRY CHRISTMAS, PA.

42:03.147 --> 42:06.025
WELL, I DON'T KNOW ABOUT
THE REST OF YOU,

42:06.192 --> 42:07.776
BUT I'D LIKE TO FIND OUT

42:07.943 --> 42:09.361
WHO GAVE ME WHAT
IN THAT BIG BOX.

42:09.528 --> 42:11.697
Charles: WELL, THERE'S
ONLY ONE WAY TO FIND OUT.

42:11.864 --> 42:12.990
LET'S OPEN IT.

42:13.157 --> 42:15.201
Charles: HAMMER'S
ON THE MANTEL.

42:19.747 --> 42:21.373
YOU NEED SOME HELP?

42:21.540 --> 42:23.292
Caroline:
I CAN Do IT.

42:35.554 --> 42:38.849
OH, IT'S THE STOVE!

42:41.769 --> 42:44.605
I WONDER
WHO GAVE THAT TO YOU.

42:50.027 --> 42:52.655
LAURA?

43:02.665 --> 43:04.041
LET ME SEE.

43:16.887 --> 43:18.973
OH, OH.
CAREFUL THERE.

43:19.139 --> 43:20.933
HELLO, NELLIE.

43:21.100 --> 43:22.559
MERRY CHRISTMAS,
INGALLS.

43:22.726 --> 43:24.478
SAME TO YOU, OLESON.

43:26.897 --> 43:28.190
Mr. Oleson:
MERRY CHRISTMAS,

43:28.357 --> 43:29.400
EVERYBODY.

43:29.566 --> 43:32.152
WELL, MRS. INGALLS,
HOW DO YOU LIKE IT?

43:32.319 --> 43:33.362
OH, I...

43:33.529 --> 43:36.282
YOU SHOULD BE VERY PROUD
OF YOUR LITTLE GIRL.

43:36.448 --> 43:37.908
SHE'S QUITE
A SHARP TRADER.

43:38.075 --> 43:40.077
OF COURSE, SHE HAD
ME OVER A BARREL,

43:40.244 --> 43:41.745
KNOWING HOW MUCH
NELLIE WANTED

43:41.912 --> 43:43.414
THAT PONY. HA!

43:48.752 --> 43:51.338
Laura: COME ON, NELLIE.
LET'S GET BUNNY.

43:51.505 --> 43:52.506
I'M SORRY, INGALLS,

43:52.673 --> 43:54.091
THAT I HAD TO SPOIL
YOUR SURPRISE,

43:54.258 --> 43:55.676
BUT THERE'S NOTHING
I COULD SAY.

43:55.843 --> 43:56.844
I UNDERSTAND.

43:57.011 --> 43:58.178
MERRY CHRISTMAS TO YOU.

43:58.345 --> 44:00.097
MERRY CHRISTMAS
TO YOU.

44:05.185 --> 44:07.563
CHARLES, HER PONY,
WE CAN'T--

44:07.730 --> 44:09.982
CAROLINE,
SHE HAD THE RIGHT.

44:10.149 --> 44:13.110
BUT SHE LOVES BUNNY SO.

44:13.277 --> 44:15.404
I THINK SHE
LOVES YOU MORE.

44:15.571 --> 44:16.947
OH, I CAN'T...

44:17.114 --> 44:20.075
CAROLINE,
SHE WANTS TO DO THIS.

44:20.242 --> 44:22.536
SHE LOVES YOU.
DON'T SPOIL IT FOR HER.

44:22.703 --> 44:24.038
OH...

45:00.532 --> 45:03.619
I'LL BE GOOD TO HIM.
I PROMISE.

45:05.662 --> 45:08.123
YOU BETTER BE.

45:08.290 --> 45:10.167
COME ON.

45:19.760 --> 45:21.178
Mr. Oleson:
THANK YOU, LAURA.

45:21.345 --> 45:24.765

THAT'S A GIRL.

45:31.313 --> 45:34.691
THERE YOU GO. YOU GOT
A NEW HOME. YES, SIR.

45:34.858 --> 45:37.528
STEADY, BUNNY.

45:43.325 --> 45:45.536
OH, LAURA...

45:46.620 --> 45:50.290
OH...l JUST LOVE
MY STOVE.

45:50.457 --> 45:52.835
DON'T CRY.

45:53.001 --> 45:55.504
SOMEDAY WE'LL
HAVE ANOTHER PONY.

45:55.671 --> 45:57.423
IT'S NOT THE PONY.

46:00.217 --> 46:01.885
I'M SORRY ABOUT
ALL THE HARD WORK YOU

46:02.052 --> 46:04.221
HAD TO DO
ON THE SADDLE, PA.

46:17.734 --> 46:19.445
OH, SADDLE.

46:31.790 --> 46:35.043
PAPA, OPEN MINE.

46:40.757 --> 46:43.886

46:44.052 --> 46:47.264

46:47.431 --> 46:48.765
WELL, THAT'S QUITE
A PRESENT.

46:48.932 --> 46:50.100

46:50.267 --> 46:51.810

46:51.977 --> 46:53.645

46:55.731 --> 46:58.066
WELL, LET'S SEE.

47:09.077 --> 47:12.539

47:15.751 --> 47:19.296
