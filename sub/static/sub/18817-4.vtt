WEBVTT

00:08.425 --> 00:09.634
Uh...

00:10.677 --> 00:13.555
This is my third coat, Jerry.
What do we think?

00:13.638 --> 00:16.224
Over the top, or just Cuban?

00:17.892 --> 00:19.519
Lady, you look great.

00:19.602 --> 00:22.439
[squeals] You better stop flirting
with me, Jerry. [laughs]

00:22.522 --> 00:24.107
People don't hook up
with their Uber driver,

00:24.191 --> 00:27.527
unless they want to be part
of a very unfortunate story in the news.

00:27.610 --> 00:30.738
But you're not gonna murder me
and throw me in the trunk, right, Jer?

00:31.322 --> 00:32.323
Well, not now.

00:32.949 --> 00:35.660
[laughing] I needed that joke.

00:36.661 --> 00:38.913
I'm a little hyped up,
if you can't tell. [chuckles]

00:38.996 --> 00:41.208
[stammers] Take it easy.
It's just a first date.

00:41.291 --> 00:42.917
Just have fun. No pressure.

00:43.000 --> 00:44.711
[exclaims] No pressure, Jerry?

00:45.503 --> 00:50.425
Mira,  a first date
is two hearts parched in the desert,

00:50.508 --> 00:53.845
quenching forever their thirst for  amor.

00:55.388 --> 00:56.514
Wait, what?

00:57.432 --> 00:58.600
Hold on.

01:00.935 --> 01:01.936
[sighs]

01:02.019 --> 01:04.814
-[cell phone rings]
-Dígame.

01:04.897 --> 01:07.609
Mami,  the story of
when you and  Papi  first met.

01:07.692 --> 01:09.402
Cuba, 1958.

01:10.487 --> 01:11.904
You might wanna circle the block, Jerry.

01:11.988 --> 01:14.949
It was a hot, steamy night,

01:15.032 --> 01:17.910
and I had borrowed
my sister Maruchi's red dress.

01:17.994 --> 01:20.288
And I had snuck into the Havana Club.

01:20.371 --> 01:23.666
And the passion fell like rain drops.

01:23.750 --> 01:25.960
And I was about to enter the heart...

01:26.920 --> 01:28.296
of the hurricane.

01:29.589 --> 01:31.258
And I'm circling the block.

01:35.220 --> 01:37.680
[in Spanish] I am Berto.

01:38.640 --> 01:41.058
I was Lydia. Now...

01:41.143 --> 01:42.477
I am yours.

01:42.560 --> 01:44.812
[Latin music playing]

01:53.738 --> 01:56.241
You are the most beautiful woman
in the world.

01:57.200 --> 02:00.162
How could you know?
You've never left Cuba.

02:01.329 --> 02:03.831
And now... I never will.

02:18.180 --> 02:20.682
What is it like to be so loved?

02:21.641 --> 02:22.725
You tell me.

02:33.444 --> 02:34.821
[in English] I don't speak Spanish,

02:34.904 --> 02:36.739
but I know
your date's not gonna be that good.

02:36.823 --> 02:38.115
[grunts]

02:38.199 --> 02:39.951
I know, Jerry!

02:40.952 --> 02:41.911
Thanks,  Mami.

02:41.994 --> 02:44.997
Claro,  but I have to go.
Schneider's a wreck.

02:45.998 --> 02:47.625
[sniffles] Tell it again.

02:49.711 --> 02:51.045
[theme song playing]

03:39.261 --> 03:44.224
Then my mom says,  "Niña,  your  papi
and I have a love that goes beyond death."

03:44.307 --> 03:46.058
You know, she still talks to him out loud.

03:47.059 --> 03:48.311
He's dead, Jerry.

03:50.939 --> 03:52.357
I'm kinda jealous of him.

03:52.857 --> 03:55.943
[chuckles] Oh, Jerry, I'm sorry.

03:56.027 --> 03:59.155
Okay, I'm out. You have a good night.

03:59.239 --> 04:01.824
-And I'mma give you five stars.
-Thank you.

04:03.285 --> 04:06.454
But I should give myself five stars
for making it out of the house tonight.

04:06.538 --> 04:09.291
I can't tell you what it took
just to get to this moment.

04:09.374 --> 04:10.875
But you're gonna, huh?

04:12.084 --> 04:14.170
Yesterday, I was in my office...
I'm a nurse.

04:14.254 --> 04:16.088
I used to be in the Army,
but I don't wanna get off track.

04:16.172 --> 04:17.382
I'll tell you about that later.

04:17.465 --> 04:19.759
Anyway, they start all this stuff
about me being...

04:20.760 --> 04:24.180
So, what's everybody got going on tonight?
Any fun plans?

04:24.264 --> 04:26.933
[chomping] I was thinking
of walking the aisles at Target

04:27.016 --> 04:29.394
to see if I can make
any new friends. [chuckles]

04:32.480 --> 04:33.648
You wanna make new friends,

04:33.731 --> 04:36.943
you ought to come to the bowling alley,
and watch me crush some pins.

04:37.026 --> 04:39.987
[laughs] That's a good...
Oh, you're serious?

04:41.614 --> 04:43.283
Well, what about you, Penelope?

04:43.366 --> 04:45.535
Oh, you know, Mama got a big pile of bills
with her name on it.

04:45.618 --> 04:48.830
-[chuckles]
-No, literally my name is on every bill.

04:48.913 --> 04:51.207
Anyway, I'm just, you know, flying solo.

04:52.417 --> 04:53.251
Penelope...

04:55.503 --> 04:57.839
you are so brave.

04:59.215 --> 05:00.842
What's happening?

05:01.968 --> 05:05.763
I mean, casting your man aside
and striking out on your own.

05:05.847 --> 05:08.433
At your age,
I would literally kill myself.

05:08.516 --> 05:09.350
Hmm...

05:10.685 --> 05:12.812
I get why you'd wanna kill you.

05:14.439 --> 05:19.193
It's not so bad out there
for older singles like Penelope and me.

05:19.276 --> 05:22.154
Ugh! I felt that one in the gut.

05:23.406 --> 05:25.617
-[sighs]
-For starters, there are so many

05:25.700 --> 05:28.453
microwave meals now,
and I dig 'em.

05:30.830 --> 05:34.917
Sometimes when I wanna splurge,
I get the Betty Crocker omelet for two,

05:35.001 --> 05:36.919
for one. [laughs]

05:37.879 --> 05:39.255
[sighs]

05:40.673 --> 05:43.009
Doc, you're forgetting about
the best part about being single.

05:43.092 --> 05:46.888
Dating apps. Oh, they're great.
There's guys like me out there.

05:46.971 --> 05:50.266
Oh, I didn't know there was an app
called "Disappointment." [laughs]

05:54.604 --> 05:56.814
You gotta start dating again, Penelope.

05:56.898 --> 05:59.275
Right now,
while there's still barely time.

05:59.358 --> 06:01.318
-I'm 38.
-I know.

06:01.403 --> 06:02.570
Okay, okay!

06:03.529 --> 06:06.616
Everybody,
I really appreciate all the advice but...

06:07.325 --> 06:08.910
I'm good. I don't need a date.

06:08.993 --> 06:13.122
I was married to Victor for 17 years,
and I'm loving not having a dude around.

06:13.205 --> 06:14.791
-[knocking on door]
-Excuse me.

06:16.876 --> 06:18.961
I guess there are some things I miss.

06:20.630 --> 06:22.590
I have a package for Penelope Alvarez.

06:22.674 --> 06:24.258
[Lori and Scott chuckle]

06:25.468 --> 06:27.762
What? Why...
why is everybody laughing?

06:28.846 --> 06:30.223
That's me.

06:30.723 --> 06:31.849
[softly] Sign here.

06:31.933 --> 06:33.100
Okay.

06:35.478 --> 06:37.439
-Penelope.
-That's my name.

06:37.522 --> 06:38.856
I'll remember now.

06:39.440 --> 06:40.358
Thank you.

06:44.278 --> 06:45.321
Oh, my God! You saw that?

06:45.404 --> 06:46.448
-You saw that! [laughs]
-[Lori squeals]

06:46.531 --> 06:48.533
[laughs] I still got it!

06:48.616 --> 06:51.077
[sing-song] I still got it. [normal] Yes!

06:51.160 --> 06:53.162
And there are hot men out there
with big packages

06:53.245 --> 06:55.247
and you know whose name
is on those big packages?

06:55.331 --> 06:56.749
Mine. [laughing]

06:58.960 --> 07:01.504
So, yeah, I still got it, Michelle,
but for how long?

07:01.588 --> 07:03.422
Because let's face it, Lori's right,

07:03.506 --> 07:06.551
when it comes to dating,
38 is basically...

07:06.634 --> 07:07.927
sixty in lady years.

07:10.137 --> 07:12.139
I'm the Dr. Berkowitz of women.

07:13.975 --> 07:16.728
I don't know what that means,
but it sounds sad.

07:18.438 --> 07:21.065
Dr. Berkowitz is my boss,
remember, Michelle?

07:21.148 --> 07:22.734
I'm about to have my first date
in 20 years,

07:22.817 --> 07:24.652
and right now you're my therapist,
so I need you to keep up.

07:25.737 --> 07:27.489
-Can I get a beer?
-No, she's busy.

07:28.865 --> 07:30.450
Let me explain what you're looking at.

07:32.118 --> 07:33.244
I'm a snowman.

07:37.457 --> 07:41.168
I don't wanna be racist,
but does that mean...

07:41.252 --> 07:42.712
coke dealer?

07:44.839 --> 07:48.342
Snowman means,
right now, I look good,

07:48.425 --> 07:52.221
because it's still winter and everything
is where it's supposed to be,

07:52.304 --> 07:54.181
but spring is a comin', girl.

07:54.265 --> 07:56.100
And all of this...

07:57.101 --> 07:58.645
is about to melt.

07:59.729 --> 08:01.523
That's silly. You look amazing!

08:01.606 --> 08:03.232
Right now, but not for long.

08:03.315 --> 08:05.652
I mean, I have one slight advantage,
'cause I got the Latina patina.

08:06.778 --> 08:08.195
Because there's something
about our skin, you know.

08:08.279 --> 08:10.281
A white girl like yourself's
gotta start worrying around 30.

08:10.364 --> 08:13.034
-How old are you?
-Thirty-three.

08:13.117 --> 08:14.285
I'm sorry, honey.

08:15.244 --> 08:18.956
But this is why I have to force myself
out there to meet Adam Bennett.

08:20.583 --> 08:23.127
-Gimme your vibe.
-Oh, hello.

08:23.210 --> 08:24.921
[laughs] He's cute, right?

08:25.004 --> 08:26.172
Yeah, yeah.

08:27.006 --> 08:29.425
Maybe he's too cute.
Maybe he won't think I'm cute.

08:29.509 --> 08:32.136
Maybe I'm not even a snowman anymore.
Maybe I've melted. Michelle!

08:33.304 --> 08:36.098
Am I just a puddle, a carrot,
and a magic hat?

08:37.266 --> 08:39.310
-Oh, no, I can't.
-It's not for you.

08:42.104 --> 08:45.066
I don't know
why I'm so freaked out! [chuckles]

08:45.149 --> 08:46.984
I was fine yesterday.

08:47.068 --> 08:48.444
How the hell do I do this?

08:48.528 --> 08:51.197
Do I like? Do I swipe?
Do I put someone in my cart?

08:52.031 --> 08:54.325
It's like watching a baby bird
learn to fly.

08:54.408 --> 08:56.536
[scoffs] Everybody I know
is either married

08:56.619 --> 08:58.287
or I'm too embarrassed to ask them.

08:58.371 --> 08:59.580
So, you were my only option.

09:00.081 --> 09:01.165
I hear ya.

09:01.248 --> 09:02.959
And I'm honored. [chuckles]

09:03.042 --> 09:07.004
-Help.
-All right, all right. [sighs]

09:07.088 --> 09:09.465
Are you sure
you wanna do the online thing?

09:09.549 --> 09:12.552
For you, I'd recommend
a more old-fashioned approach.

09:12.635 --> 09:14.261
Go to a coffee shop,

09:14.345 --> 09:16.639
make eye contact
with an appealing stranger,

09:16.723 --> 09:18.808
then, follow them home.

09:20.643 --> 09:23.395
-Follow them home?
-Yeah. Or to their car.

09:23.479 --> 09:25.732
You could try a bathroom stall,
but that's a little sketch.

09:26.816 --> 09:29.068
I mean, listen, you do you,
but you're a mother now.

09:29.860 --> 09:31.737
I'm not looking to have sex with someone.

09:31.821 --> 09:34.156
[chuckles] Yeah,
let's not put that in your profile.

09:35.950 --> 09:37.660
I get it, you mean a real date.

09:37.744 --> 09:39.662
Yes, it's been 20 years.

09:40.246 --> 09:42.081
You know, back then, online dating meant

09:42.164 --> 09:45.835
hooking up while waiting in line
to buy Boyz II Men tickets.

09:49.213 --> 09:51.799
I helped turn a couple of boys to men.
[chuckles]

09:53.551 --> 09:54.385
Okay.

09:54.468 --> 09:55.720
-[chuckles]
-Okay.

09:55.803 --> 09:58.514
Ooh, ooh, use this picture for my profile.
I look cute there.

09:58.598 --> 10:01.183
So do your kids.
No one wants to see your kids.

10:02.184 --> 10:06.480
That's, like, a second date revealer.
If you're good, a never reveal.

10:06.981 --> 10:09.150
Right, right, lie about everything.
This is good.

10:09.233 --> 10:11.235
Do you have some paper
so I could write this down?

10:11.318 --> 10:13.154
I'm just gonna do a little Photoshop,

10:13.237 --> 10:16.949
replace the kids with a bicycle,
so he thinks you exercise.

10:17.033 --> 10:19.451
And... we're live.

10:20.536 --> 10:22.538
Okay, what about this guy?
He went to Brown.

10:22.622 --> 10:24.248
Yeah, but he's posing with a tiger.

10:24.331 --> 10:27.084
Yeah, but he's holding nunchucks,
so he's awesome!

10:28.419 --> 10:31.047
But not for you. Okay. [clears throat]

10:31.130 --> 10:34.466
You might also want to avoid guys
who post their abs, but not their face.

10:34.550 --> 10:36.510
And anyone who says
they're an entrepreneur.

10:36.593 --> 10:37.679
What does your profile say?

10:37.762 --> 10:39.346
I am an entrepreneur.

10:40.431 --> 10:42.099
[sighs]

10:42.183 --> 10:44.560
Okay, what about this guy?
He's a cop.

10:45.853 --> 10:49.106
Okay, a guy in uniform.
I'm not uninterested.

10:50.066 --> 10:52.068
He has nice eyes.

10:52.276 --> 10:53.235
"Adam Bennett."

10:54.236 --> 10:55.487
And you have a date tonight.

10:55.571 --> 10:58.157
-No, wait, what? That was too fast.
-No, you're too slow.

10:58.240 --> 10:59.533
He's probably already forgotten
about your date

10:59.617 --> 11:02.912
and moved on to someone
whose bicycle isn't wearing sneakers.

11:03.579 --> 11:05.372
I'm really bad at Photoshop.

11:07.416 --> 11:09.210
Come on, Pen, you doing this or not?

11:10.169 --> 11:12.714
Okay, you know what?

11:14.423 --> 11:15.632
I realized I...

11:15.716 --> 11:17.677
I didn't think this through at all. I...

11:18.260 --> 11:19.887
I mean,
my mom still thinks I'm married,

11:19.971 --> 11:22.223
so, you know,
she's gonna lose her mind and...

11:23.515 --> 11:24.600
Elena might be okay,

11:24.683 --> 11:28.270
but Alex, he's still so young
and this could definitely mess with him.

11:30.690 --> 11:32.149
I don't think I should do it.

11:33.400 --> 11:35.444
If my family finds out,
it'll be a disaster.

11:36.695 --> 11:37.696
Maybe just don't tell 'em?

11:38.280 --> 11:39.949
Genius! Let's do this thing!

11:41.408 --> 11:44.078
Set it up for tomorrow, 7:30.
Both kids are busy.

11:44.161 --> 11:45.621
-And, Schneider?
-Yeah?

11:45.704 --> 11:46.748
-Schneider. Hey!
-Yeah.

11:46.831 --> 11:48.415
-All right.
-Look at me in the eye here.

11:48.499 --> 11:49.458
Okay?

11:50.459 --> 11:53.838
My mom, Elena, Alex...

11:54.755 --> 11:56.173
Nobody can know.

11:56.674 --> 12:00.177
Hey, don't worry,
I'll be way too busy to tell them.

12:00.677 --> 12:03.097
Just texted nunchucks guy
and I think we're gonna hang.

12:04.515 --> 12:07.518
[Penelope] So then I was like,
"Let's do this thing!" [chuckles]

12:07.601 --> 12:09.812
I went to Sephora,
and bought a tube of mascara,

12:09.896 --> 12:11.355
so I could get a free makeover.

12:11.438 --> 12:14.066
Hey, did you know
that mascara's, like, 14 bucks now?

12:14.150 --> 12:15.651
[Abby] Mine was 36.

12:16.944 --> 12:19.572
[Penelope] Shut your face,
my new best friend, Abby!

12:19.655 --> 12:22.742
[Abby] Hey, can I get that toilet paper
I asked for five minutes ago?

12:22.825 --> 12:25.202
[Penelope chuckling] Oh, yeah, I'm sorry.

12:27.913 --> 12:28.914
[sighs]

12:29.706 --> 12:32.668
Found a jumpsuit for 40 bucks
that shows off the...

12:32.751 --> 12:34.628
[sing-song] girls!

12:34.711 --> 12:36.755
[normal] Talking about my boobs, Abby!

12:38.174 --> 12:39.591
-[toilet flushing]
-Anyway...

12:42.719 --> 12:44.638
curled, sprayed, plucked.

12:44.721 --> 12:47.308
Abby, I am hairless.

12:47.391 --> 12:48.935
And I am here.

12:49.977 --> 12:50.936
Oh, man.

12:51.937 --> 12:54.106
I even shaved my lady 'stache.

12:54.190 --> 12:56.233
-[Abby] Wait, you can do that?
-Yes.

12:56.317 --> 12:59.445
It doesn't grow back thicker.
That's a myth started by Big Wax.

13:00.905 --> 13:03.324
[exhales sharply] Oh, look at me.

13:03.407 --> 13:04.992
[inhales deeply] Uh...

13:05.952 --> 13:08.079
when I met my ex,
I was wearing sneaks, jeans,

13:08.162 --> 13:10.039
a tit tank and a flannel.

13:10.122 --> 13:11.833
[Abby crying]

13:11.916 --> 13:13.209
I know, it was a better time.

13:14.210 --> 13:15.211
[Abby continues crying]

13:17.671 --> 13:19.048
Wait, are you okay?

13:19.131 --> 13:21.092
[Abby] I'm sorry,
I thought my boyfriend, Benji,

13:21.175 --> 13:23.719
was going to propose to me tonight
and he didn't.

13:23.802 --> 13:25.429
-All right, come on, Abby.
-[knocking]

13:25.512 --> 13:27.473
Open up.
We gotta hug this out.

13:27.556 --> 13:29.016
[Abby sniffles and sighs]

13:30.226 --> 13:31.560
[sniffles]

13:36.941 --> 13:39.568
[chuckles] Are you kidding me?

13:39.651 --> 13:40.945
What?

13:41.820 --> 13:44.781
Sweetheart, look at you!

13:46.075 --> 13:50.287
Don't take this the wrong way,
but your problems are nothing.

13:52.915 --> 13:54.375
Yeah, wow!

13:57.920 --> 13:59.796
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

13:59.881 --> 14:01.340
I just mean...

14:02.299 --> 14:04.676
that Benji is just a bump

14:04.760 --> 14:08.639
in what is obviously going to be a very
smooth and luxurious road. [chuckles]

14:09.556 --> 14:11.558
Whoever you marry, he'll be rich.

14:11.642 --> 14:14.061
And you'll probably end up being
one of those Real Housewives ladies.

14:14.145 --> 14:16.105
And anyway,
this is like 20 years from now

14:16.188 --> 14:17.523
because you're a child.

14:17.606 --> 14:21.152
A tall, hot child!

14:22.319 --> 14:25.489
Do you really think that I could be
one of the Real Housewives?

14:26.866 --> 14:28.159
I know you can.

14:29.118 --> 14:30.411
And now, I'm gonna say to you

14:30.494 --> 14:33.289
what I wish my mother would have
said to me before my date.

14:33.372 --> 14:34.206
Good luck.

14:34.290 --> 14:35.791
Thanks!

14:35.875 --> 14:38.585
Wait, I thought your family didn't know.

14:38.669 --> 14:41.505
[sighs] Oh, I didn't tell you
what my mother said?

14:43.173 --> 14:45.342
Red lipstick is for  putas.

14:50.890 --> 14:51.724
What?

14:51.807 --> 14:53.517
I'm just saying...

14:53.976 --> 14:58.314
you should wear red lipstick
for your encounter tonight.

15:00.107 --> 15:03.444
-Damn it, Schneider.
-No, Schneider didn't say anything.

15:03.527 --> 15:07.656
I know because you obviously
shaved your moustache.

15:09.366 --> 15:10.409
Was it that bad?

15:10.492 --> 15:13.245
Ay, niña,  I felt like braiding it.

15:14.830 --> 15:16.040
Anyway.

15:16.623 --> 15:20.002
I'm just having dinner, okay?
And I'm not being a  puta.

15:20.961 --> 15:22.880
No, you're a married woman,

15:23.047 --> 15:26.300
who is going out on a date with a man
who is not your husband.

15:26.383 --> 15:28.427
What is the right word? Let me see...

15:28.510 --> 15:30.554
[clicks tongue] Uh,  sucia?

15:30.637 --> 15:31.763
Tramp? No.

15:31.847 --> 15:34.516
Ah, of course, [chuckles] hoochie.

15:37.353 --> 15:38.479
I am separated.

15:38.562 --> 15:40.272
And I'm not having this conversation.

15:40.356 --> 15:42.608
And keep your voice down
because the kids can't know.

15:43.484 --> 15:45.361
Hey, you shaved your 'stache!

15:47.279 --> 15:48.948
What's going on? Do you have a date?

15:50.657 --> 15:52.743
How is everybody
figuring this out so fast?

15:54.286 --> 15:56.246
I didn't want you to worry,
so I didn't wanna tell you.

15:56.330 --> 15:57.164
It's just dinner.

15:57.248 --> 16:00.042
Mom, I'm fine!
I mean, I thought it was cool

16:00.126 --> 16:02.794
that you were blurring gender lines
with your upper lip...

16:03.879 --> 16:05.547
but this is great!

16:08.592 --> 16:11.553
Okay, mostly what I'm hearing
is I have to up my grooming game.

16:14.265 --> 16:16.100
But you're... you're really okay?

16:16.183 --> 16:17.309
Of course.

16:17.393 --> 16:20.562
I mean, it's well-documented
that women in their late 30s

16:20.646 --> 16:21.897
are in their sexual prime.

16:21.981 --> 16:24.441
-Ay,  Elena. Please.
-[grunts]

16:24.525 --> 16:27.027
You're too okay with it.
And don't tell Alex.

16:27.111 --> 16:28.904
-I mean it.
-[scoffs] Please.

16:28.988 --> 16:30.739
First of all, I'm not a gossip

16:30.823 --> 16:32.866
and if I were,
it wouldn't be to my little brother

16:32.950 --> 16:34.243
about my mom's love life.

16:34.326 --> 16:35.911
[shushes]

16:49.717 --> 16:50.592
Am I in trouble?

16:52.428 --> 16:53.262
No.

16:53.846 --> 16:56.015
We're... we're just thinking.

16:56.848 --> 16:58.100
[Elena sighs] Mmm.

17:01.353 --> 17:04.065
Well, when you're done thinking,
can I have $100?

17:04.148 --> 17:05.232
[scoffs] What?

17:05.816 --> 17:07.234
I don't know, I need money for tonight

17:07.317 --> 17:09.153
because me and my friends
are going bowling.

17:09.236 --> 17:11.738
Or miniature golfing. Or to the arcade.

17:11.822 --> 17:13.532
I don't know, just give me $100!

17:14.033 --> 17:15.451
Uh, okay. [chuckles]

17:15.534 --> 17:18.829
First of all, you need a plan.
Second of all, I need to approve the plan,

17:18.912 --> 17:20.581
and third of all, 100 bucks?

17:20.664 --> 17:22.624
[chuckles] That was funny.

17:23.751 --> 17:24.668
No...

17:26.337 --> 17:29.131
Stupid Finn keeps changing his mind.

17:29.215 --> 17:30.549
First he invites Joaquin.

17:30.632 --> 17:33.219
Then he has to invite Jade
because he invited Joaquin.

17:33.302 --> 17:35.679
Then she wants to bring JuJu
and Casey and Maddie.

17:35.763 --> 17:38.724
I don't know any of these people!
We need to talk more!

17:39.225 --> 17:40.392
Don't talk to him.

17:41.977 --> 17:43.854
-He cannot know about this date.
-Whoa!

17:43.937 --> 17:45.731
Okay, okay!  Dios mío.

17:46.940 --> 17:49.651
-So weird. I was dying to tell him.
-[sighs]

17:49.735 --> 17:52.196
I'm, like, buzzing.
Is this what gossip is?

17:53.364 --> 17:54.531
[scoffs] Who am I?

17:56.158 --> 17:57.868
[Lydia speaking Spanish]

17:58.869 --> 18:01.163
Abuelita  is talking
to ghost  Abuelito  again.

18:02.790 --> 18:05.542
[Lydia continues speaking Spanish]

18:05.626 --> 18:07.127
[laughing]

18:07.711 --> 18:08.921
I'm not talking to you.

18:13.258 --> 18:14.927
So, does  Papi  think I'm a  puta,  too?

18:15.010 --> 18:16.345
Ay, no seas ridícula,

18:16.428 --> 18:18.555
your  papi  would never say
those things about you.

18:18.639 --> 18:19.681
Only I think that.

18:21.142 --> 18:22.768
Also, you're sitting on him.

18:23.644 --> 18:25.187
I'm doing this.

18:25.271 --> 18:27.398
Come on,  Mami,
it would be nice to have your support.

18:31.610 --> 18:33.153
I suppose...

18:33.654 --> 18:38.367
there is nothing wrong
with having dinner with a friend...

18:39.034 --> 18:40.619
who is a man, so...

18:45.666 --> 18:46.500
Thank you.

18:47.668 --> 18:51.338
If you wanna have a second dinner,
wear the red lipstick.

18:52.881 --> 18:54.133
I actually don't own one.

18:55.592 --> 18:57.761
You can borrow mine.

19:00.472 --> 19:02.808
So, I finally forced myself
out of the house

19:02.891 --> 19:05.101
and overcame an expected,

19:05.186 --> 19:07.313
yet still surprisingly strong
anxiety attack.

19:08.397 --> 19:09.856
Now I'm here. [chuckles]

19:09.940 --> 19:12.859
[chuckles] Your waiter
will be with you in a minute.

19:12.943 --> 19:14.361
Thanks, Kristen.

19:14.445 --> 19:15.862
We didn't get a chance to talk much,
but...

19:15.946 --> 19:17.030
[snaps fingers] you seem cool.

19:24.205 --> 19:25.872
[indistinct chatter]

19:33.255 --> 19:35.757
Hi, I'm Tyler.
I'll be taking care of you tonight.

19:35.841 --> 19:38.969
I know you're waiting for one more,
but can I start you off with an appetizer?

19:39.052 --> 19:42.264
No, you can start me off with a drink.
[laughs]

19:42.348 --> 19:44.808
Because, Tyler,
I went through hell to get here tonight.

19:45.684 --> 19:48.520
Every aspect of this date has been
dissected by all the people in my life.

19:48.604 --> 19:52.774
My mom, my daughter, my landlord,
some giant, hot baby in the bathroom.

19:54.193 --> 19:57.446
Have you seen her, by the way?
Please tell me she's eating something.

19:57.654 --> 20:00.241
The point is,
everybody had an opinion about this.

20:01.367 --> 20:02.618
Okay.

20:03.869 --> 20:05.537
So, uh, do you know what you want?

20:12.211 --> 20:14.213
[scoffs] Of course.

20:14.296 --> 20:15.839
Why wouldn't you two be waiting for me?

20:16.924 --> 20:18.300
I thought you had a thing with Carmen.

20:18.383 --> 20:21.220
I came home early so we could all dish.

20:22.846 --> 20:25.057
Cuéntanos de todo.

20:25.766 --> 20:28.227
Did he have soulful eyes?

20:28.310 --> 20:30.979
Were his teeth white,
but not too white?

20:32.022 --> 20:34.275
Now the teeth are too white.
What is that?

20:36.318 --> 20:38.487
He was very nice. And I'm glad I did it.

20:38.570 --> 20:42.157
But, uh, wasn't two hearts in the desert
like you and  Papi.

20:42.241 --> 20:43.242
Aw!

20:43.325 --> 20:44.535
[blows raspberries]

20:48.622 --> 20:50.040
Yeah, I'm not gonna see him again.

20:50.541 --> 20:51.708
See who?

20:51.792 --> 20:54.044
You didn't wanna give me the heads-up
that he was here?

20:54.628 --> 20:55.963
Heads-up, Alex is here.

20:58.924 --> 21:01.134
Wait, why are you wearing
Abuelita's  lipstick?

21:01.217 --> 21:03.387
-Ay.
-Why do you know that?

21:03.470 --> 21:05.013
[imitates Lydia] It's Scarlet Sunrise.

21:05.096 --> 21:06.139
[normal] Duh!

21:09.142 --> 21:10.811
And why are you all dressed up?

21:10.894 --> 21:12.854
[sighs] All right,
everybody, get out of here,

21:12.938 --> 21:14.523
so I can talk to Alex.

21:16.107 --> 21:17.276
Sit down,  papito.

21:20.946 --> 21:23.156
-What happened to your face?
-What happened to  your  face?

21:27.452 --> 21:29.830
[stutters] I'm sorry.
I was hanging out with my friends.

21:29.913 --> 21:31.039
It's hard to turn it off.

21:39.631 --> 21:42.968
Anyway, stupid Finn pushed me
into a bush and I got scratched.

21:43.051 --> 21:45.679
[scoffs] Why do you like that kid again?
Because he seems like a--

21:45.762 --> 21:46.722
Like a dick?

21:48.890 --> 21:51.852
Yes, but that's not okay
that you said that.

21:55.981 --> 21:57.858
Anyway, I wanna be straight with you.

21:59.485 --> 22:01.111
Tonight I had a date.

22:01.194 --> 22:02.863
Wait, just listen.

22:04.823 --> 22:06.241
So, do you know what you want?

22:09.285 --> 22:11.580
-Let me give you a second.
-Thank you.

22:41.234 --> 22:42.819
-You walked out?
-[shushes]

22:42.903 --> 22:44.946
I don't want
those gossiping hens to hear.

22:45.864 --> 22:47.074
But yes...

22:48.867 --> 22:51.327
No one has asked me
what I wanted in a long time.

22:52.079 --> 22:54.539
And I realized
what I wanted wasn't a date.

22:55.624 --> 22:57.125
[chuckles lightly]
Then what did you want?

22:58.251 --> 23:00.629
A crappy chick flick by myself.

23:01.212 --> 23:04.800
And a fro-yo with three too many toppings.
The kind that I make you and Elena split.

23:04.883 --> 23:06.301
-Aw, man!
-[chuckles]

23:07.594 --> 23:09.888
Anyway, I sent the guy a text apologizing,

23:09.971 --> 23:12.307
but I want  Abuelita  to think
that I went out with him,

23:12.391 --> 23:14.184
so that next time
I don't get the third degree.

23:14.768 --> 23:15.685
Next time?

23:16.395 --> 23:17.229
Yeah.

23:18.063 --> 23:20.941
Because I'm pretty sure there's gonna be
a next time at some point.

23:23.110 --> 23:24.027
Are you okay with that?

23:25.612 --> 23:28.114
Yeah, I mean, I figured you would.

23:29.240 --> 23:32.368
After all, women in their late 30s
are in their sexual prime.

23:32.453 --> 23:34.037
Oh, God! What?

23:35.497 --> 23:37.583
Stop talking to your sister.

23:37.666 --> 23:39.668
Tell her to stop talking to me!

23:43.171 --> 23:44.465
[Penelope sighs]

23:45.048 --> 23:47.884
Anyway, dating is super weird.

23:47.968 --> 23:49.970
I know! I know...

23:50.971 --> 23:52.055
Why do you know?

23:52.639 --> 23:55.559
My dumb friends have been trying
to get me and this girl, Anna, together.

23:56.518 --> 23:58.854
Oh, I see. [chuckles]

23:59.354 --> 24:01.732
So, what happened tonight
was Finn made a plan.

24:01.815 --> 24:04.860
Then everybody bailed on purpose,
so Anna and I could be alone.

24:05.610 --> 24:06.528
Okay.

24:07.028 --> 24:09.531
I mean, I like Anna,
but I don't really want a girlfriend.

24:09.615 --> 24:12.367
It was like everyone had
something to say about it, but me.

24:12.450 --> 24:14.786
[chuckles] That's exactly how I felt.

24:16.246 --> 24:19.666
And you're right,
dating is super weird, until it's not.

24:24.588 --> 24:26.715
Something else you wanna talk to me about?

24:27.966 --> 24:30.719
Well, I kinda lied to you.

24:31.427 --> 24:32.846
Oh, God, what is it?

24:32.929 --> 24:35.306
Did you steal something?
Did you damage something?

24:35.390 --> 24:36.558
Did you pee on something
'cause you were mad

24:36.641 --> 24:38.977
and then later you were, like,
"I shouldn't have done that"?

24:39.728 --> 24:41.688
No! Who does that?

24:43.607 --> 24:45.692
These are just general examples.

24:47.110 --> 24:48.695
[sighs] What did you do?

24:49.321 --> 24:51.698
This isn't because Finn pushed me
into a bush.

24:52.824 --> 24:53.783
I tried to shave.

24:55.243 --> 24:56.244
Really?

24:57.621 --> 25:00.707
Oh, my God.
[chuckles] It's all happening.

25:00.791 --> 25:02.083
[Alex chuckles]

25:02.167 --> 25:06.922
So... you don't want a girlfriend,
but you did wanna look nice.

25:08.215 --> 25:09.132
I guess.

25:09.633 --> 25:12.177
I used one of your razors
and cut myself.

25:13.553 --> 25:15.388
I have no idea what I'm doing.

25:17.098 --> 25:19.142
I think I know someone
who can help you out. [chuckles]

25:24.230 --> 25:26.482
I am a Latina,
you are a 12-year-old boy,

25:26.566 --> 25:28.735
so we have
the same amount of facial fuzz.

25:29.069 --> 25:29.903
Okay.

25:30.821 --> 25:32.530
Watch and learn.

25:33.949 --> 25:34.866
You wanna go...

25:35.909 --> 25:38.369
with... the hair.

25:40.372 --> 25:41.289
Uh-huh.

25:41.373 --> 25:43.875
Now that I'm shaving,
it's gonna grow back thick, right?

25:43.959 --> 25:45.585
No, that's a myth.

25:45.669 --> 25:47.128
Aw, man!

26:00.058 --> 26:02.018
Hola, mi vida.

26:02.102 --> 26:06.773
Berto, you look  guapísimo  in that suit.

26:06.857 --> 26:09.067
Which is why you buried me in it.

26:09.150 --> 26:10.360
[chuckles]

26:11.444 --> 26:14.530
So, Lupe did not go on that date.

26:14.615 --> 26:16.366
-¿Qué?
-Mmm-hmm.

26:16.449 --> 26:18.409
-You told me she was going.
-Oh, she lied.

26:18.493 --> 26:20.286
Mentirosa.  She said she went,

26:20.370 --> 26:23.456
but when she got home,
she wasn't super happy,

26:23.540 --> 26:24.874
she wasn't super sad.

26:24.958 --> 26:26.752
And I know our Lupe.

26:27.335 --> 26:29.879
There was no date.

26:29.963 --> 26:32.173
What are we going to do
about our  niña?

26:32.257 --> 26:35.093
Dichoso tú , you don't have to do anything.

26:36.637 --> 26:38.096
Lo siento, mi amor.

26:38.179 --> 26:39.765
Yeah, you don't look that sorry.

26:39.848 --> 26:41.307
[moans]  ¿Qué puedo hacer?

26:41.391 --> 26:44.770
[laughs] Bertito...

26:44.853 --> 26:48.273
they broke the mold when they made you.

26:48.356 --> 26:50.191
Now you're just being nice.

26:51.192 --> 26:53.778
-I'm not that nice.
-[Berto chuckles]

26:54.655 --> 26:56.197
That's why I married you.

26:56.281 --> 26:58.199
[man singing in Spanish]

27:18.636 --> 27:21.431
Little aloe vera on your upper lip
and you're good to go.

27:21.514 --> 27:23.516
I can't wait
until I have more hair than you.

27:24.100 --> 27:25.060
Me neither!

27:26.186 --> 27:27.562
[Lydia laughs]

27:27.645 --> 27:30.148
-[Lydia speaking Spanish]
-[Latin music playing]

27:30.231 --> 27:31.524
What's  Abuelita  doing?

27:32.108 --> 27:33.151
She's on a date.

27:44.871 --> 27:46.790
[mouthing song in Spanish]

27:56.883 --> 27:59.427
