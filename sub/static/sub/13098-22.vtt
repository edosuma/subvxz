WEBVTT

00:01.750 --> 00:03.958
[instrumental music]

00:04.042 --> 00:06.917
These unprovoked attacks
must stop!

00:07.000 --> 00:09.417
The attacks will stop
when the Centauri government

00:09.500 --> 00:11.167
stops sending hostile ships

00:11.250 --> 00:13.042
across the border
into Narn space.

00:13.125 --> 00:15.750
(Londo)
'Quadrant 37 is neutral
territory!'

00:15.833 --> 00:17.750
The treaty makes that
perfectly clear.

00:17.833 --> 00:20.167
The Narn government no longer
recognize the treaty

00:20.250 --> 00:22.708
since it was imposed upon
our people by force.

00:22.792 --> 00:25.000
There! You see? I told you.

00:25.083 --> 00:27.583
They can't be trusted to abide
by their own agreements.

00:27.667 --> 00:29.333
An agreement signed under duress

00:29.417 --> 00:31.333
is no agreement at all, is it,
ambassador?

00:31.417 --> 00:34.375
Gentlemen, please,
this is getting us nowhere.

00:34.458 --> 00:36.875
Ambassador G'Kar,
your people have operated

00:36.958 --> 00:39.042
the military base on the border
of Centauri space

00:39.125 --> 00:41.917
for nearly five years
without incident.

00:42.042 --> 00:43.458
Why this sudden provocation?

00:43.542 --> 00:45.000
Our patrols are necessary

00:45.083 --> 00:47.000
for non-planetary security.

00:47.083 --> 00:48.375
Keep this up, G'Kar

00:48.458 --> 00:50.417
and soon you won't have
a planet to protect.

00:50.500 --> 00:53.333
I'll return when this council
is ready to discuss things

00:53.417 --> 00:55.750
in a civilized fashion.

00:57.917 --> 00:59.333
Ah!

01:00.375 --> 01:03.417
[instrumental music]

01:09.208 --> 01:11.292
[indistinct chatter]

01:15.792 --> 01:17.333
Sir.

01:17.417 --> 01:18.375
Alert Medbay.

01:18.458 --> 01:21.167
[gasping]

01:21.250 --> 01:24.542
Petrov! Petrov, what happened?

01:24.625 --> 01:27.333
You gotta stop 'em.

01:27.417 --> 01:29.458
They're gonna kill him.

01:30.958 --> 01:32.958
They're gonna kill..

01:33.042 --> 01:34.583
Gonna kill who?

01:34.667 --> 01:36.750
Petrov.

01:36.833 --> 01:38.208
Petrov!

01:41.542 --> 01:45.042
(male narrator)
It was the dawn
of the Third Age of mankind

01:45.125 --> 01:48.167
ten years after
the Earth-Minbari War.

01:48.250 --> 01:51.750
The Babylon Project
was a dream given form.

01:51.833 --> 01:53.833
Its goal,
to prevent another war

01:53.917 --> 01:56.583
by creating a place where
humans and aliens

01:56.667 --> 01:59.167
could work out their
differences peacefully.

01:59.250 --> 02:02.000
It's a port of call,
home away from home

02:02.083 --> 02:07.375
for diplomats, hustlers,
entrepreneurs and wanderers.

02:07.458 --> 02:09.167
Humans and aliens,
wrapped in

02:09.250 --> 02:11.792
two million five hundred
thousand tons

02:11.875 --> 02:13.625
of spinning metal

02:13.708 --> 02:15.792
all alone in the night.

02:17.208 --> 02:19.125
It can be a dangerous place.

02:19.208 --> 02:22.375
But it's our last,
best hope for peace.

02:22.458 --> 02:26.375
This is the story of the last
of the Babylon stations.

02:26.458 --> 02:28.667
The year is 2258.

02:28.750 --> 02:32.583
The name of the place
is Babylon 5.

02:34.875 --> 02:37.917
[theme music]

03:14.917 --> 03:18.042
'I picked him up about six
months ago on petty theft.'

03:18.125 --> 03:19.458
Not a bad guy,
just somebody who got

03:19.542 --> 03:21.583
in over his head
with the wrong people.

03:21.667 --> 03:23.583
I helped him out and he wanted
to repay the favor.

03:23.667 --> 03:24.667
Since then he's been
working for me

03:24.750 --> 03:26.042
as an informant in Downbelow.

03:26.125 --> 03:28.250
Was he working on anything
when he was attacked?

03:28.333 --> 03:30.833
No, I hadn't heard from him
in almost two weeks.

03:30.917 --> 03:33.000
[beeping]

03:33.083 --> 03:35.625
I'm sorry, by the time he got
here he lost so much blood

03:35.708 --> 03:37.292
there was nothing we could do.

03:37.375 --> 03:38.958
He's dead.

03:41.708 --> 03:43.958
Damn.

03:44.042 --> 03:45.458
He was just starting
to get it together.

03:45.542 --> 03:48.042
Straighten out his life,
and now he..

03:50.917 --> 03:53.083
It must've been something
really big to make him come

03:53.167 --> 03:55.292
all this way hurting like that.

03:55.375 --> 03:57.750
Last thing he said was,
"They're going to kill him."

03:57.833 --> 04:00.792
- Kill who?
- I don't know.

04:00.875 --> 04:03.042
But I'm gonna find out.

04:03.125 --> 04:06.333
(woman on TV)
'After which the president and
his escort left the Mars colony'

04:06.417 --> 04:10.000
'on a goodwill tour
of the outer planet colonies.'

04:10.083 --> 04:12.542
'Sources close to the president
have hinted'

04:12.625 --> 04:15.792
'that he'll give a major
policy speech New Year's Day'

04:15.875 --> 04:18.083
'from the jump point on Io.'

04:18.167 --> 04:21.167
'The speech is likely to
concern human/alien relations'

04:21.250 --> 04:24.375
over the remainder
of his five year term.

04:24.458 --> 04:26.500
We'll continue to bring you
more live updates

04:26.583 --> 04:28.500
on the five planet goodwill tour

04:28.583 --> 04:31.167
'here on the Interstellar
Network News.'

04:31.250 --> 04:32.833
Fade.

04:32.917 --> 04:35.167
You got any plans
for new year's Eve yet?

04:36.292 --> 04:38.000
Well, assuming I'm not
still up to my ears

04:38.083 --> 04:42.000
in this Narn situation,
no, no plans.

04:42.083 --> 04:45.292
Good. Because I made
a few arrangements.

04:45.375 --> 04:46.667
Such as?

04:46.750 --> 04:51.000
Well, let it be a surprise,
okay?

04:51.083 --> 04:55.458
Sure. Guess that makes two of us
with surprises.

04:55.958 --> 04:57.833
Oh?

05:01.375 --> 05:05.958
I was thinking the other day, uh

05:06.042 --> 05:08.792
12, almost 15 years

05:08.875 --> 05:11.375
that's a long time
to know someone.

05:11.458 --> 05:15.042
I mean, sure, we got together

05:15.125 --> 05:16.958
'split up,
gotten together again..'

05:17.042 --> 05:20.167
Yes, it's been
quite a pony ride.

05:20.250 --> 05:22.125
But even through
the worst of it

05:22.208 --> 05:26.333
the fights, the years apart

05:26.417 --> 05:28.583
I never stopped
thinking about you.

05:30.083 --> 05:32.250
Never stopped loving you.

05:32.333 --> 05:35.750
'I didn't know why sometimes,
I tried my best not to care'

05:35.833 --> 05:38.583
but it never went away.

05:38.667 --> 05:42.333
And this time I think
we finally got it right.

05:43.625 --> 05:46.750
So now with the new year coming

05:46.833 --> 05:49.167
I've been going over it
in my head and..

05:53.042 --> 05:55.750
Look, do you wanna get married
or don't you?

05:55.833 --> 05:57.208
Yes.

06:01.000 --> 06:02.333
Well, good.

06:05.500 --> 06:08.750
- How's April by you?
- July is better.

06:10.458 --> 06:12.167
Alright.

06:12.250 --> 06:14.458
- You want coffee?
- No.

06:16.792 --> 06:19.875
[instrumental music]

06:24.083 --> 06:27.250
Vir, how many Gods are there
in our Pantheon?

06:27.333 --> 06:29.250
I've lost count
since the last emperor

06:29.333 --> 06:31.042
was elevated to Godhood.

06:31.125 --> 06:32.917
Uh, 48. No, no, 49.

06:33.000 --> 06:35.292
Fifty, if you count Zoog,
but, you know, I never thought--

06:35.375 --> 06:37.583
- Alright, let's say 50.
- Fifty.

06:37.667 --> 06:40.875
Now, out of that 50,
how many Gods do you think

06:40.958 --> 06:43.292
I must've offended
to have ended up

06:43.375 --> 06:46.583
with G'Kar's teeth
buried so deeply in my throat

06:46.667 --> 06:48.708
that I can barely breathe?

06:48.792 --> 06:50.542
All of them?

06:50.625 --> 06:52.375
Sounds right.

06:53.875 --> 06:56.875
And now I-I have to go
back to the council

06:56.958 --> 07:00.500
and explain to them
that in the interest of peace

07:00.583 --> 07:03.333
the Centauri government
will agree to give

07:03.417 --> 07:06.208
Quadrant 37 to the Narn's.

07:07.333 --> 07:09.667
[sighs]
I think I'll stick my head

07:09.750 --> 07:12.167
in the station's fusion reactor.

07:12.250 --> 07:13.792
It would be quicker

07:13.875 --> 07:17.792
and I suspect after a while
I might even come to enjoy it.

07:17.875 --> 07:19.375
- Ambassador, why don't you--
- But this!

07:19.458 --> 07:22.000
Th-th-this is like being

07:22.083 --> 07:24.583
nibbled to death by, uh..

07:27.417 --> 07:29.000
What are those earth creatures
called?

07:29.083 --> 07:33.083
Feathers, long bill,
webbed feet, go quack?

07:33.167 --> 07:34.708
- Cats.
- Cats.

07:34.792 --> 07:37.917
Like being nibbled to death
by cats.

07:38.000 --> 07:40.250
[beeping]

07:40.333 --> 07:42.500
- Yes?
- 'Ambassador Mollari, please.'

07:42.583 --> 07:45.583
I'm sorry, he's very busy.
Perhaps I can take a message?

07:45.667 --> 07:47.917
Wait, Vir, let me see.

07:49.292 --> 07:51.417
'Yes, I thought it was you.'

07:51.500 --> 07:53.625
I trust the Eye is still safe.

07:53.708 --> 07:57.000
Yes, with your help.
What is it?

07:57.083 --> 07:58.875
You have a problem, ambassador.

07:58.958 --> 08:01.375
I believe I can help.
But I think we should meet.

08:01.458 --> 08:04.208
In the park, say, an hour?

08:04.292 --> 08:07.542
I'll be there. One more thing.

08:07.625 --> 08:10.875
- I never caught your name.
- Morden.

08:10.958 --> 08:12.833
See you in an hour.

08:15.125 --> 08:16.833
[dramatic music]

08:16.917 --> 08:18.542
Who was that?

08:18.625 --> 08:21.375
Someone who did me
a great favor.

08:21.458 --> 08:23.750
More than that
you don't need to know.

08:23.833 --> 08:25.583
You can go, Vir.

08:33.125 --> 08:36.458
- Did you see Ambassador Kosh?
- I did.

08:37.833 --> 08:41.583
Did you relay my question
precisely?

08:41.667 --> 08:43.833
Word for word?

08:43.917 --> 08:45.542
I did.

08:45.625 --> 08:49.583
- His reaction?
- Just one word.

08:49.667 --> 08:52.333
He said yes.

09:00.833 --> 09:02.458
Wait for me.

09:11.208 --> 09:13.292
[indistinct chatter]

09:16.667 --> 09:18.917
I'm looking for anybody who
might've known Stephen Petrov?

09:19.000 --> 09:21.000
He used to live around here,
so..

09:23.083 --> 09:26.917
How about you?
Any of you guys know Petrov?

09:27.000 --> 09:30.042
Come on, the guy is dead, don't
you wanna get whoever did it?

09:31.250 --> 09:33.792
Life's cheap down here, friend.

09:33.875 --> 09:35.958
Funny how the only time
you seem to care

09:36.042 --> 09:38.917
is when one of your weasels
gets it.

09:46.583 --> 09:48.292
(male #1)
'In here.'

10:03.583 --> 10:05.000
You got something for me?

10:05.083 --> 10:07.292
I knew Petrov. He was okay.

10:07.375 --> 10:09.792
Yeah, he was. And now he's dead.

10:11.583 --> 10:13.167
A lot of us we take
whatever work

10:13.250 --> 10:15.417
we can get around the station.

10:15.500 --> 10:16.792
So when the guys come down
they say

10:16.875 --> 10:18.333
"We need two or five
or seven of you."

10:18.417 --> 10:19.875
We go, and it's not easy work.

10:19.958 --> 10:22.500
And sometimes it's not what you
would think is nice

10:22.583 --> 10:24.542
but it beats scrounging.

10:27.542 --> 10:29.542
Last week, one of the guys
hired us

10:29.625 --> 10:32.208
to load cargo for transport.

10:32.292 --> 10:34.833
What kind of cargo?

10:34.917 --> 10:39.333
We don't ask. If it was legit,
they would use somebody else.

10:40.875 --> 10:42.542
'After we finished,
Petrov stayed on.'

10:42.625 --> 10:45.875
Seemed kinda funny at the time.

10:45.958 --> 10:48.500
'Cause I could tell
the guy was trouble.

10:48.583 --> 10:50.417
You got a name?

10:52.458 --> 10:54.375
Devereaux.

10:54.458 --> 10:56.667
That's all I know.

10:56.750 --> 10:58.917
He hangs out down in the casino.

11:00.542 --> 11:02.750
- Thanks.
- Oh, one thing.

11:04.292 --> 11:07.042
The last time I saw Petrov was..

11:07.125 --> 11:09.375
...just before
he went looking for you.

11:11.167 --> 11:14.208
Whatever he saw,
whatever he knew

11:14.292 --> 11:16.708
scared him half to death.

11:17.875 --> 11:20.917
[intense music]

11:40.667 --> 11:44.083
- Ambassador.
- Mr. Morden.

11:44.167 --> 11:46.417
You never gave me a chance
to thank you

11:46.500 --> 11:50.500
after you rescued the Eye
from those triple-damn raiders.

11:50.583 --> 11:54.125
Unnecessary. I'm here to be
of service, ambassador.

11:54.208 --> 11:55.750
My associates believe
that you're a person

11:55.833 --> 11:57.583
of great potential.

11:57.667 --> 11:59.583
Trapped in a position
where your skills are unseen

11:59.667 --> 12:01.292
and unappreciated.

12:01.375 --> 12:03.333
They'd like to change that.

12:03.417 --> 12:06.792
Yes, I've heard this before.

12:06.875 --> 12:09.125
And I have stopped listening.

12:09.208 --> 12:12.750
There's comes a time
when you look into the mirror

12:12.833 --> 12:14.750
and you realize
that what you see

12:14.833 --> 12:17.792
is all that you will ever be.

12:17.875 --> 12:22.833
Then you accept it,
or you kill yourself..

12:22.917 --> 12:26.125
...or you stop looking
into mirrors.

12:26.208 --> 12:29.583
No, nothing can be changed.

12:29.667 --> 12:32.625
Then nothing's lost by trying.

12:32.708 --> 12:35.000
'You have a problem,
Ambassador Mollari.'

12:35.083 --> 12:39.167
Quadrant 37. We can fix it
for you, if you let us.

12:39.250 --> 12:43.250
A heavily guarded
Narn military outpost

12:43.333 --> 12:48.208
and you and your associates
are going to fix it? For me?

12:48.292 --> 12:50.333
[Londo laughing]

12:52.792 --> 12:55.250
You have a very peculiar
sense of humor.

12:55.333 --> 12:56.917
Yes, I do.

12:58.750 --> 13:00.167
Tell your government

13:00.250 --> 13:02.708
that you will personally
take care of Quadrant 37.

13:02.792 --> 13:05.708
They'll think I'm drunk
or insane.

13:05.792 --> 13:06.667
Perhaps.

13:06.750 --> 13:08.333
And you don't want credit

13:08.417 --> 13:10.250
for this grand endeavor?

13:10.333 --> 13:13.667
No. We're simply here to help.

13:15.292 --> 13:17.083
Good day, ambassador.

13:18.125 --> 13:21.500
Mr. Morden, if I may ask.

13:22.958 --> 13:27.375
What is the price for this help?

13:27.458 --> 13:29.375
'No price, ambassador.'

13:29.458 --> 13:31.708
But at some point in the future

13:31.792 --> 13:33.833
if we deliver on our promises,
we may come to you

13:33.917 --> 13:36.708
and ask you for a favor.
That's all.

13:43.750 --> 13:45.792
[steam hissing]

13:47.458 --> 13:50.542
[instrumental music]

13:57.708 --> 14:01.042
I have come, as I said I would.

14:01.125 --> 14:03.625
[breathes deeply]

14:03.708 --> 14:06.833
Kosh, I have great doubts.

14:06.917 --> 14:09.250
I must know if it's true.

14:09.333 --> 14:12.000
I must see with my own eyes.

14:27.417 --> 14:28.958
Yes.

14:29.583 --> 14:31.750
Thank you.

14:31.833 --> 14:34.167
Now I will keep the promise.

14:35.292 --> 14:36.708
Goodbye.

14:36.792 --> 14:40.167
You will not see me again
as I am now.

14:50.833 --> 14:53.167
(male #2)
'Alright! A winner!'

14:54.875 --> 14:56.917
[indistinct chatter]

15:14.542 --> 15:15.958
Mr. Devereaux?

15:16.042 --> 15:18.333
Security Chief Garibaldi. I'd
like to ask you a few questions.

15:18.417 --> 15:21.167
Look, I'm busy right now.
Maybe later.

15:21.250 --> 15:23.250
I understand you hired
a lurker recently

15:23.333 --> 15:24.500
name of Stephen Petrov.

15:24.583 --> 15:25.958
I hire a lot of people.

15:26.042 --> 15:27.625
Names, faces,
I don't keep track.

15:27.708 --> 15:29.625
Fine, then you'll come down
to security

15:29.708 --> 15:32.375
and we'll show you a picture.
Maybe that'll jog your memory.

15:32.458 --> 15:35.083
- I don't have time for this.
- Make time.

15:36.917 --> 15:40.167
Alright. Fine, fine.

15:42.333 --> 15:44.167
Big mistake, hotshot.

15:44.250 --> 15:47.000
You shouldn't poke around
in things you don't understand.

15:47.083 --> 15:49.625
This is too big for you.

15:49.708 --> 15:52.875
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I'm shakin' in my boots.

15:54.000 --> 15:56.250
Now, move it.

16:01.250 --> 16:04.125
Uh, ambassador, we just had
a message from Centauri Prime.

16:04.208 --> 16:05.875
They wanna know if you've
relayed their decision

16:05.958 --> 16:07.458
to the advisory council.

16:07.542 --> 16:10.333
No. No, I haven't.

16:10.417 --> 16:12.333
And I'm not going to.

16:12.417 --> 16:14.792
Ah, that should go over well.

16:14.875 --> 16:17.042
Send a reply to Homeworld.

16:17.125 --> 16:18.792
Tell them..

16:19.917 --> 16:21.583
Tell them that I will
personally take care

16:21.667 --> 16:23.833
of the problem in Quadrant 37.

16:23.917 --> 16:25.208
Alright, I'll.. What?

16:25.292 --> 16:26.917
Is there something wrong
with your hearing?

16:27.000 --> 16:29.250
No, it's just for a moment
I thought I had

16:29.333 --> 16:31.417
entered an alternate universe
or something.

16:31.500 --> 16:34.042
Ambassador, are you sure
you're feeling alright?

16:34.125 --> 16:36.750
Vir, I am quite sober.

16:37.708 --> 16:39.625
Send the message.

16:39.708 --> 16:41.750
[intense music]

16:43.167 --> 16:45.167
[beeping]

16:47.958 --> 16:52.750
(computer)
'Opening communication channel
to Centauri Prime.'

16:52.833 --> 16:54.792
'Please stand by.'

16:54.875 --> 16:56.875
[beeping]

16:56.958 --> 16:58.458
Enter.

17:00.708 --> 17:02.917
'Commander, it's late.'

17:03.000 --> 17:05.083
I know,
I just thought I'd try once more

17:05.167 --> 17:07.417
to settle the Quadrant 37
situation.

17:07.500 --> 17:08.958
I'm afraid the ambassador
is resting.

17:09.042 --> 17:11.917
He's rather fatigued
from his heavy schedule.

17:12.000 --> 17:14.042
Perhaps if you came back.

17:23.875 --> 17:26.958
I believe the ambassador
can see you now.

17:35.208 --> 17:37.583
Ah, Sinclair,
what a joy to see you again.

17:37.667 --> 17:38.667
What can I do for you?

17:38.750 --> 17:40.250
You can start by giving
the Centauri

17:40.333 --> 17:41.458
some room to maneuver.

17:41.542 --> 17:43.375
Ah, back to that again, are we?

17:43.458 --> 17:46.333
As far as I'm concerned
this is a dead issue.

17:46.417 --> 17:47.917
We have to keep pushing forward.

17:48.000 --> 17:51.250
'G'Kar, you once told me
that before the Centauri came'

17:51.333 --> 17:54.958
Narn was an agrarian world,
a peaceful world.

17:55.042 --> 17:56.667
In order to be free,
you had to learn to fight.

17:56.750 --> 17:59.542
No one questions that.
But you've overcompensated.

17:59.625 --> 18:01.500
You're like abused children
who've grown big enough

18:01.583 --> 18:03.125
to do the same thing
to someone else.

18:03.208 --> 18:06.833
As if that'll somehow
balance the scales. It won't.

18:06.917 --> 18:08.667
If you let your anger
cloud your judgment

18:08.750 --> 18:10.542
it'll destroy you.

18:11.583 --> 18:13.750
We know what we're doing.

18:15.042 --> 18:17.750
Anything else, commander?

18:17.833 --> 18:20.333
Just that I've had
this feeling lately.

18:21.500 --> 18:24.542
That we're standing
at a crossroads.

18:24.625 --> 18:26.750
And I don't like
where we're going.

18:28.000 --> 18:31.083
But there's still time
to choose another path.

18:31.167 --> 18:34.125
'You can be part of that
process, G'Kar.'

18:34.208 --> 18:36.125
'Choose wisely.'

18:36.208 --> 18:37.958
Not just for the Centauri,
but for the good

18:38.042 --> 18:40.625
of your own people as well.

18:43.125 --> 18:45.958
We all do what we have to.

18:48.125 --> 18:50.875
It's late. Please go now.

18:52.917 --> 18:54.583
[door hissing]

18:55.833 --> 18:58.292
So, what's the occasion?

18:58.375 --> 18:59.708
Who says there has to be
an occasion

18:59.792 --> 19:01.375
to invite you to join us
for dinner?

19:01.458 --> 19:02.875
I didn't get to be
head of security

19:02.958 --> 19:05.042
because of my good looks.

19:05.125 --> 19:06.792
So? What's up?

19:10.083 --> 19:12.708
We need you to do a job for us.

19:12.792 --> 19:14.958
No problem, give me the guy's
name and I'll lean on him.

19:15.042 --> 19:16.958
Not that kind of job.

19:18.375 --> 19:20.458
I think the official title
is best man.

19:20.542 --> 19:22.667
Best.. You two?

19:22.750 --> 19:25.708
And I'll need a maid of honor.
I don't really know anyone here.

19:25.792 --> 19:29.125
- So, if you wouldn't mind.
- I'd be honored.

19:29.208 --> 19:31.292
Congratulations.

19:31.375 --> 19:33.583
This is great.
After all this time.

19:33.667 --> 19:36.792
I'm glad things
are working out for ya.

19:36.875 --> 19:38.292
It's funny,
I was thinking the other day

19:38.375 --> 19:40.583
about all the things
we've gone through.

19:40.667 --> 19:42.750
'Good times and bad and..'

19:42.833 --> 19:45.417
Look, you know me,
I'm not very good at this

19:45.500 --> 19:48.917
but I just wanted you to know

19:49.000 --> 19:51.833
I've always been proud
to be your friend, Jeff.

19:51.917 --> 19:54.833
And I'm honored
to be your best man.

19:54.917 --> 19:56.917
'Hell, I'm honored to be best
at anything.'

19:57.000 --> 19:59.042
[laughing]

20:00.500 --> 20:04.333
Never fails.
Garibaldi. What?

20:04.417 --> 20:06.250
(male #3)
'Chief, the prisoner
you brought in'

20:06.333 --> 20:08.917
'Edgar Devereaux,
he's missing.'

20:09.000 --> 20:10.875
Missing? What the hell do you
mean he's missing?

20:10.958 --> 20:12.292
(male #3)
'I don't know, sir,
he's just gone'

20:12.375 --> 20:13.958
'along with the two men
who were with him.'

20:14.042 --> 20:16.542
Alright, on my way.

20:18.333 --> 20:19.750
I knew there was more
to this Devereaux guy

20:19.833 --> 20:21.292
than meets the eye.

20:21.375 --> 20:23.542
I checked the weapon
I took off him.

20:23.625 --> 20:26.833
Every PPG has a serial number
stamped on the inner coil.

20:26.917 --> 20:29.458
The coils are Morbidium alloy,
harder than diamond

20:29.542 --> 20:31.417
so the number can't be removed.

20:31.500 --> 20:33.583
But his PPG
didn't have a number.

20:33.667 --> 20:35.167
You're saying he found a way
to remove it?

20:35.250 --> 20:36.833
(Garibaldi)
'I'm saying it was never there.'

20:36.917 --> 20:38.875
Only special agents
in EarthForce Security

20:38.958 --> 20:40.958
get unnumbered PPGs.

20:41.042 --> 20:43.333
But this guy's name
wasn't on file.

20:43.417 --> 20:45.125
And now he's gone.

20:45.208 --> 20:49.125
I don't like this, Jeff.
I don't like this a lot.

20:50.583 --> 20:53.708
[instrumental music]

21:04.375 --> 21:06.833
(male #4)
'Perimeter guard to base.
Nothing to report.'

21:06.917 --> 21:09.000
- Sector is clear.
- 'Acknowledged.'

21:09.083 --> 21:12.875
- Report to..
- Base? Repeat.

21:12.958 --> 21:14.042
[whirring]

21:14.125 --> 21:16.500
[intense music]

21:16.583 --> 21:18.625
[zapping]

21:22.417 --> 21:24.417
[explosion]

21:31.333 --> 21:33.417
[zapping]

21:40.667 --> 21:42.708
[whirring]

21:46.417 --> 21:48.042
Any more ships due in
for a while?

21:48.125 --> 21:50.375
Negative.

21:50.458 --> 21:52.208
(woman on TV)
'..at which time
the vice president'

21:52.292 --> 21:53.917
'disembarked EarthForce One.'

21:54.000 --> 21:56.042
'He is currently undergoing
medical tests'

21:56.125 --> 21:59.250
'while the president continues
en route to Jupiter.'

21:59.333 --> 22:01.375
Reports indicate
that the vice president

22:01.458 --> 22:03.708
is suffering from
a viral infection

22:03.792 --> 22:07.708
and hopes to catch up with the
tour as it returns from Io.

22:10.458 --> 22:12.250
Chief.

22:12.333 --> 22:13.833
I thought I left you
watching the store?

22:13.917 --> 22:15.875
You know how this place gets
on New Year's Eve.

22:15.958 --> 22:17.167
Ah, it's quiet up there.

22:17.250 --> 22:19.625
Figured I'd see if I could help.
What've we got?

22:19.708 --> 22:22.542
Devereaux hired Petrov
to load crates for transport.

22:22.625 --> 22:25.375
One shipment never made it out
due to engine problems.

22:25.458 --> 22:27.542
Thought I'd see
what was so important.

22:27.625 --> 22:29.250
What's the manifest say?

22:29.333 --> 22:33.417
Uh, medical supplies,
bandages, that sort of thing.

22:33.500 --> 22:35.583
Wouldn't it be better
to try and find Devereaux?

22:35.667 --> 22:38.500
We'll find him,
meanwhile with any luck

22:38.583 --> 22:41.542
this'll tell us what scared
Petrov like that.

22:44.708 --> 22:47.542
Medical supplies?
I don't think so.

22:56.125 --> 22:58.292
Look like some kind of
transmitters.

23:00.708 --> 23:03.292
That's weird.
They're set to broadcast static.

23:04.792 --> 23:06.792
They're powerful enough to flood
whatever channel they're using.

23:06.875 --> 23:09.708
Blank it out, sort of a poor
man's jamming device.

23:15.208 --> 23:17.333
What's that?

23:17.417 --> 23:19.875
Some kind of triangulation
system.

23:19.958 --> 23:22.792
Helps determine optimum
placement for the transmitters.

23:24.250 --> 23:25.750
Location is set for

23:25.833 --> 23:31.250
grid 0-0-1 by 5 by 9.

23:31.333 --> 23:33.875
That would put it just off
the transfer point on Io.

23:35.208 --> 23:37.292
What's the frequency
on that transmitter?

23:37.375 --> 23:41.417
Uh.. Can't make it out.

23:41.500 --> 23:43.542
Here, let me see that.

23:44.667 --> 23:48.583
1-0-1-0-1-0-5.

23:50.375 --> 23:54.083
That's the gold channel
frequency for EarthForce One.

23:54.167 --> 23:56.792
Why would someone want
to jam the president's..

23:58.292 --> 23:59.833
Oh, my God.

23:59.917 --> 24:01.958
- Garibaldi to Sinclair.
- 'Sinclair here.'

24:02.042 --> 24:03.833
Commander, we've got a problem.
Ultraviolet priority!

24:03.917 --> 24:05.458
Meet me in the briefing room
in 20 minutes.

24:05.542 --> 24:06.833
- 'What is it?'
- Not over the link.

24:06.917 --> 24:08.292
I'll tell you when I see you.

24:08.375 --> 24:09.583
Guard those boxes
with your life.

24:09.667 --> 24:11.000
Don't let anything
happen to them.

24:11.083 --> 24:12.708
'Will do.'

24:15.125 --> 24:18.042
This is Blue Alpha. Stand by.

24:19.375 --> 24:22.458
[dramatic music]

24:24.792 --> 24:26.625
I told you not to poke around

24:26.708 --> 24:28.542
in things that are
too big for you.

24:28.625 --> 24:30.292
Yeah, well, that's a little
late for that.

24:30.375 --> 24:33.667
- Now, up against the wall.
- I think not.

24:35.333 --> 24:36.792
[zapping]

24:48.750 --> 24:51.792
[intense music]

25:07.667 --> 25:09.625
- Sinclair to C&amp;C.
- 'On line.'

25:09.708 --> 25:12.417
I thought I'd check my quarters
incase Garibaldi doubled back.

25:12.500 --> 25:14.583
Still no sign of him.
I don't like it.

25:14.667 --> 25:16.625
(C&amp;C)
'Agreed, he wouldn't call
for an ultraviolet alert'

25:16.708 --> 25:17.917
'and then vanish, unless..'

25:18.000 --> 25:20.250
I know. Keep trying to raise him
on the link.

25:20.333 --> 25:22.042
Let me know
as soon as you hear anything.

25:22.125 --> 25:23.292
(C&amp;C)
'Confirmed.'

25:23.375 --> 25:25.667
[beeping]

25:25.750 --> 25:27.042
Come.

25:27.125 --> 25:29.583
Michael, where the hell..

25:32.375 --> 25:34.042
Hello.

25:36.708 --> 25:39.125
I believe you recognize this.

25:40.875 --> 25:44.000
[instrumental music]

25:49.250 --> 25:50.667
Yes.

25:52.875 --> 25:55.250
You remember what happened
at the Battle of the Line

25:55.333 --> 25:57.000
'don't you?'

25:57.083 --> 26:00.125
'You remember being taken
aboard our ship.'

26:00.208 --> 26:01.792
Only a little.

26:01.875 --> 26:04.583
Fragments. Images.

26:04.667 --> 26:06.500
I don't know what it all means.

26:06.583 --> 26:09.417
I suspected as much.

26:09.500 --> 26:12.250
We have a lot to discuss,
commander.

26:12.333 --> 26:16.083
By coming to you, I'm putting
both our lives at risk.

26:16.167 --> 26:18.292
But there are things
you should know.

26:19.458 --> 26:21.708
[sighs]
This isn't a good..

26:22.958 --> 26:25.042
We can't find Garibaldi.

26:25.125 --> 26:27.208
I understand.

26:27.292 --> 26:30.375
Come to my quarters
and I'll tell you..

26:30.458 --> 26:32.292
...as much as I can.

26:35.000 --> 26:37.792
But don't wait too long,
commander.

26:37.875 --> 26:41.500
Certain things
have been set in motion..

26:41.583 --> 26:44.292
...and I do not have much time.

26:46.917 --> 26:49.917
[intense music]

26:51.917 --> 26:53.917
[groaning]

27:28.708 --> 27:30.500
Ambassador?

27:31.792 --> 27:33.875
What is it, Na'Toth?

27:33.958 --> 27:36.833
The outpost in Quadrant 37
is gone.

27:36.917 --> 27:40.542
What do you mean, gone?
You can't establish contact?

27:40.625 --> 27:42.875
That's what we thought at first.

27:42.958 --> 27:46.042
So Homeworld sent out
a ship to investigate.

27:46.125 --> 27:49.083
'The entire outpost
has been destroyed'

27:49.167 --> 27:50.875
every building leveled.

27:50.958 --> 27:53.833
Three heavy cruisers
in near orbit, gone.

27:53.917 --> 27:57.167
- Fighters, gone.
- How?

27:57.250 --> 27:59.875
- The outpost records?
- 'Destroyed.'

28:03.000 --> 28:04.500
Survivors?

28:05.667 --> 28:07.042
None.

28:09.000 --> 28:12.125
Ten thousand of our best
warriors, dead.

28:12.208 --> 28:16.417
It's as if some great hand
reached out of space and..

28:16.500 --> 28:18.625
...just erased them.

28:18.708 --> 28:20.542
It wasn't the humans.

28:22.208 --> 28:25.000
The Centauri don't have
the will.

28:26.000 --> 28:28.750
The Vorlons don't care.

28:28.833 --> 28:31.208
'The Minbari wouldn't do it.'

28:32.417 --> 28:34.292
'The other worlds
aren't powerful enough'

28:34.375 --> 28:36.542
'for a strike like this.'

28:39.042 --> 28:42.125
[instrumental music]

28:45.208 --> 28:48.208
There's someone else out there,
Na'Toth.

28:50.750 --> 28:52.792
[groaning]

29:05.250 --> 29:08.125
(all)
Six, five, four

29:08.208 --> 29:11.208
three, two, one!

29:11.292 --> 29:13.417
[cheering]
Happy New Year!

29:21.417 --> 29:23.583
I remember last year,
it was great.

29:23.667 --> 29:24.833
Yeah.

29:24.917 --> 29:26.917
[screaming]

29:30.417 --> 29:33.167
Are you sure there's
no other way?

29:34.542 --> 29:37.083
What must happen will happen.

29:38.292 --> 29:40.833
Valen said this day would come.

29:42.167 --> 29:46.167
Who are we to stand
in the way of prophecy?

29:47.167 --> 29:49.833
But what if you're wrong?

29:57.083 --> 29:59.750
Then speak well of me
when I'm gone.

30:04.042 --> 30:07.125
[instrumental music]

30:18.792 --> 30:20.792
[whirring]

30:29.292 --> 30:32.042
If he comes, it must be soon.

30:33.042 --> 30:35.000
'We have little time.'

30:38.750 --> 30:42.625
Blood pressure 60 over 10,
respiration 30, pulse 120.

30:42.708 --> 30:44.792
Prep Isolab for surgery.
Let's get those patches here.

30:44.875 --> 30:46.500
- Stop the bleeding. Stat!
- How bad is it?

30:46.583 --> 30:48.583
It's bad. Extensive thermal
tissue damage.

30:48.667 --> 30:51.500
Massive damage to the kidney,
the pancreas and the spleen.

30:51.583 --> 30:53.125
You set?
Alright, let's turn him.

30:53.208 --> 30:55.292
One, two, three. Oh! Move.

30:55.375 --> 30:56.958
- Alright, hook him up.
- 'Will he make it?'

30:57.042 --> 30:58.583
I'm not sure.

31:00.208 --> 31:03.333
We can't operate
until we stabilize him.

31:03.417 --> 31:05.167
Command..

31:05.792 --> 31:07.583
Commander..

31:07.667 --> 31:09.792
It's alright, Michael. I'm here.
You'll be okay.

31:09.875 --> 31:11.792
- Got to..
- Lie still.

31:11.875 --> 31:15.042
No, they're going to..

31:15.125 --> 31:17.833
...going to kill
the president..

31:19.208 --> 31:22.500
...at the transfer point on Io.

31:22.583 --> 31:23.667
Warn.. Warn..

31:23.750 --> 31:26.083
We're losing him!
Stand by on morphozine!

31:26.167 --> 31:28.500
Let's get those injectors ready.
Let's go.

31:28.583 --> 31:31.792
- 'Move, move, move!'
- 'Comin' through.'

31:31.875 --> 31:33.792
(female #1)
As EarthForce One
moves into position

31:33.875 --> 31:36.458
silhouetted against
the surface of Jupiter.

31:36.542 --> 31:39.208
It's a sight guaranteed
to impress voters.

31:41.208 --> 31:42.500
Have you gotten through
to EarthForce One yet?

31:42.583 --> 31:44.000
Conventional channels
are being jammed.

31:44.083 --> 31:45.125
Started about five minutes ago.

31:45.208 --> 31:46.458
What about the gold channels?

31:46.542 --> 31:47.625
The same, they're jamming
all military

31:47.708 --> 31:48.917
transmission around Jupiter.

31:49.000 --> 31:50.208
- Re-route to civilian channels.
- Re-routing.

31:50.292 --> 31:51.542
Get Earth Central online.

31:51.625 --> 31:52.958
All I'm getting
is a recorded message from

31:53.042 --> 31:54.583
the Tachyon relay station
from Proxima.

31:54.667 --> 31:55.833
Are we still getting the ISN
feed?

31:55.917 --> 31:57.292
- Yes, sir.
- Put it on-screen.

31:57.375 --> 31:59.000
And keep working
on the civilian channels.

31:59.083 --> 32:00.667
If we can get through to ISN,
maybe they can warn them.

32:00.750 --> 32:01.792
There it is.

32:01.875 --> 32:03.542
It is our understanding
that the president

32:03.625 --> 32:06.042
was scheduled to begin
his New Year's day speech

32:06.125 --> 32:07.625
ten minutes ago.

32:07.708 --> 32:09.833
'So far there's been no word
from EarthForce One'

32:09.917 --> 32:12.333
'on the reason for the delay.'

32:12.417 --> 32:14.958
'According to ISN sources
in Earthdome'

32:15.042 --> 32:18.208
'the speech is expected
to contain..'

32:18.292 --> 32:19.750
Just a minute.

32:19.833 --> 32:21.917
We're picking up
an emergency signal now.

32:22.000 --> 32:24.042
[explosion]

32:29.333 --> 32:32.375
[dramatic music]

32:37.583 --> 32:39.667
(woman on TV)
'A-are we still on the air?'

32:42.792 --> 32:46.042
'Station Io is dispatching
hospital ships'

32:46.125 --> 32:47.500
'but it doesn't seem possible..'

32:47.583 --> 32:48.500
Shut it off.

32:48.583 --> 32:49.667
...anyone could've survived

32:49.750 --> 32:50.708
that kind of..

32:50.792 --> 32:52.167
Shut it off.

33:07.958 --> 33:10.125
(Sinclair)
'Dr. Franklin thinks
they can begin the operation'

33:10.208 --> 33:11.542
'in about five hours.'

33:11.625 --> 33:12.792
'Even under good conditions'

33:12.875 --> 33:15.083
'the odds of survival are
50/50.'

33:16.958 --> 33:20.000
Garibaldi mentioned a name.
Devereaux.

33:20.083 --> 33:22.833
Check all outgoing ships.
Find him.

33:22.917 --> 33:25.250
I want guards posted here
around the clock

33:25.333 --> 33:27.167
plus 24 hour a day
medical observation.

33:27.250 --> 33:29.417
There's always the chance that
whoever started this job

33:29.500 --> 33:31.000
will try to finish it.

33:31.083 --> 33:34.750
I won't allow that to happen.
Understood?

33:34.833 --> 33:36.625
Understood.

33:41.000 --> 33:44.042
[intense music]

33:45.667 --> 33:47.667
[whimpering]

34:03.000 --> 34:05.042
I was looking for the commander.

34:05.125 --> 34:08.625
- 'He's in Medlab.'
- Mr. Garibaldi?

34:08.708 --> 34:11.583
We won't know for a while yet.

34:11.667 --> 34:13.958
I came to tell him that there
seems little point

34:14.042 --> 34:17.458
to another council meeting
to discuss Quadrant 37.

34:17.542 --> 34:19.125
We imagine you've heard by now.

34:19.208 --> 34:20.792
Yes, a little while ago.

34:20.875 --> 34:22.458
Any clues yet as to who did it?

34:22.542 --> 34:24.792
No. None.

34:24.875 --> 34:28.500
My condolences
on the death of your president.

34:28.583 --> 34:30.667
This has been a black day
for both of us

34:30.750 --> 34:32.792
Lieutenant Commander Ivanova.

34:32.875 --> 34:34.500
'A black and terrible day.'

34:34.583 --> 34:36.417
We will find
whoever is responsible

34:36.500 --> 34:38.333
for the destruction of our base.

34:38.417 --> 34:40.917
And we will retaliate.

34:41.000 --> 34:44.542
Though our two races
have had our troubles..

34:44.625 --> 34:47.833
...I wish you luck
in your own quest for justice.

34:47.917 --> 34:50.833
May the guilty be found
and punished.

34:52.833 --> 34:54.333
Ambassador,
you wanted to see me?

34:54.417 --> 34:56.333
Yes. What have you done?

34:56.417 --> 34:58.000
Only what you asked me to do.

34:58.083 --> 35:00.667
You had a problem with Quadrant
37, we took care of it for you.

35:00.750 --> 35:03.542
Yes, but you killed
10,000 Narns.

35:03.625 --> 35:05.792
I didn't know you cared.

35:05.875 --> 35:07.125
Ten thousand,
a hundred thousand,

35:07.208 --> 35:09.250
a million,
what's the difference?

35:09.333 --> 35:12.208
They're Narns, ambassador,
your sworn enemy.

35:12.292 --> 35:15.083
Yes, I know,
but I didn't think..

35:15.167 --> 35:18.542
I thought that you might find
a way to protect our ships

35:18.625 --> 35:21.542
o-o-or cripple their forces,
not..

35:21.625 --> 35:23.667
[shushing]

35:29.125 --> 35:32.042
'Ambassador, your name
is being spoken'

35:32.125 --> 35:35.333
at the highest levels
of the Centauri government.

35:35.417 --> 35:37.833
They don't know how you did it,
they don't care.

35:37.917 --> 35:41.083
They credit you, with saving
them from another embarrassment

35:41.167 --> 35:44.333
'without creating a war
in the process.'

35:44.417 --> 35:46.542
They've noticed you, ambassador.

35:46.625 --> 35:49.208
Which was the point
of the exercise.

35:49.292 --> 35:51.875
'I hear they have
great plans for you.'

35:51.958 --> 35:55.333
Yes, but 10,000 in cold blood?

35:55.417 --> 35:59.708
Ambassador, you're a hero.
Enjoy it.

36:00.958 --> 36:02.708
I'll be around.

36:07.375 --> 36:10.208
I understand your concern,
but at the moment

36:10.292 --> 36:12.375
there's nothing to support
your theory.

36:12.458 --> 36:14.167
'Everything we've found
points to'

36:14.250 --> 36:17.583
a malfunction in EarthForce
One's fusion reactor.

36:17.667 --> 36:19.417
- It was an accident.
- Senator.

36:19.500 --> 36:21.000
My chief of security was shot

36:21.083 --> 36:22.375
on the course
of an investigation.

36:22.458 --> 36:24.375
'He's lying in the isolab
right now.'

36:24.458 --> 36:25.958
And it's even money
as to whether or not

36:26.042 --> 36:27.458
he ever walks out again.

36:27.542 --> 36:28.750
The last thing he said was that

36:28.833 --> 36:30.083
they were going to kill
the president.

36:30.167 --> 36:32.500
Commander,
I consider it very unlikely

36:32.583 --> 36:34.167
that your security chief
would just stumble

36:34.250 --> 36:36.583
across something our best agents
didn't know about.

36:36.667 --> 36:39.417
- You're not listening.
- I am listening, commander.

36:39.500 --> 36:42.667
You're just not saying anything
worth hearing.

36:42.750 --> 36:44.500
I won't have you
causing a panic

36:44.583 --> 36:46.833
by spreading
unsubstantiated rumors.

36:46.917 --> 36:48.917
'You are ordered
to maintain silence'

36:49.000 --> 36:50.708
'on this matter, commander.'

36:52.750 --> 36:54.000
What's up?

36:54.083 --> 36:56.167
I found those men the
commander's been looking for.

36:56.250 --> 36:58.458
Tried to take them in for
questioning, they resisted.

36:58.542 --> 37:02.292
'Lead guy took a shot at me.
I returned fire. Self-defense.'

37:03.750 --> 37:06.583
PPG's cold.

37:06.667 --> 37:08.958
If he'd fired,
it'd still be warm.

37:09.042 --> 37:11.125
You have a point to make?

37:13.875 --> 37:15.292
No.

37:16.750 --> 37:20.292
Everyone knows these things
cool off pretty fast down here.

37:20.375 --> 37:22.792
Get him into the freezer.

37:22.875 --> 37:26.083
- 'Blood pressure, respiration?'
- It's weak, but holding.

37:26.167 --> 37:28.833
This is as good
as we're ever going to get it.

37:30.875 --> 37:33.167
Let's proceed.

37:33.250 --> 37:34.833
Following confirmation
of the death

37:34.917 --> 37:38.125
of Earth Alliance President
Luis Santiago

37:38.208 --> 37:43.000
Vice President Morgan Clark
was sworn in as president.

37:43.083 --> 37:46.375
'The ceremony took place aboard
EarthForce Two'

37:46.458 --> 37:48.500
'now en route back to Earth.'

37:48.583 --> 37:51.000
I, Morgan William Clark,
do hereby swear

37:51.083 --> 37:53.917
to uphold the laws
of the Earth Alliance

37:54.000 --> 37:55.458
and to perform
the role of president

37:55.542 --> 37:57.167
to the best of my abilities.

37:57.250 --> 38:00.042
(woman on TV)
'In a later statement,
President Clark had this to say'

38:00.125 --> 38:02.167
'about the death
of President Santiago.'

38:02.250 --> 38:05.167
(Clark)
'It is important that we
move on to create the world'

38:05.250 --> 38:07.083
that Luis Santiago
would've wanted

38:07.167 --> 38:09.583
for his children, my children

38:09.667 --> 38:12.500
and for posterity yet to come.

38:12.583 --> 38:15.042
We will begin by focusing
more on the needs

38:15.125 --> 38:17.542
of our own people,
to sustain them

38:17.625 --> 38:19.375
through this difficult time

38:19.458 --> 38:22.125
'and to prepare them
for the tasks ahead.'

38:29.083 --> 38:32.083
And so it begins.

38:34.625 --> 38:38.167
You have forgotten something?

38:40.125 --> 38:41.750
Delenn.

38:47.792 --> 38:50.875
[instrumental music]

39:07.708 --> 39:09.250
Lennier?

39:09.333 --> 39:11.167
You're too late.

39:20.625 --> 39:23.667
[music continues]

39:31.667 --> 39:32.917
What..

39:36.167 --> 39:38.167
'What is it?'

39:38.250 --> 39:41.792
A chrysalis. She is changing.

39:42.958 --> 39:45.125
Into what?

39:45.208 --> 39:47.292
'I don't know.'

39:56.875 --> 39:58.458
Ambassador G'Kar?

39:58.542 --> 40:02.792
(computer)
Voice recognition pattern
Na'Toth recognized.

40:02.875 --> 40:05.958
Message delivery start.

40:06.042 --> 40:10.583
Na'Toth, by the time you get
this message I will be gone.

40:10.667 --> 40:14.458
I have certain suspicions about
the attack on Quadrant 37.

40:14.542 --> 40:17.917
I'm taking the first transport
back to Homeworld.

40:18.000 --> 40:21.875
You will not be able to contact
me. I will contact you.

40:21.958 --> 40:25.375
And, uh, one more thing.

40:25.458 --> 40:26.875
Tell the commander..

40:28.625 --> 40:30.375
...he was right.

40:30.458 --> 40:35.000
We were at a crossroads,
and there is no going back.

40:36.500 --> 40:39.583
Expect me when you see me.

40:51.917 --> 40:55.333
I just heard,
is the commander..

40:55.417 --> 40:59.167
I just relieved him. He'll be
back on watch in four hours.

40:59.250 --> 41:00.833
How is he?

41:00.917 --> 41:04.417
They're still operating. It's
taking longer than expected.

41:06.667 --> 41:11.292
Well, if you don't mind,
I would like to wait with you.

41:14.083 --> 41:15.500
He is an annoying man

41:15.583 --> 41:19.792
but I would miss him if he..

41:23.333 --> 41:26.417
[instrumental music]

41:36.500 --> 41:39.167
Yes. I think he's ready.

41:40.083 --> 41:42.292
He's perfect for our needs.

41:43.292 --> 41:45.125
No.

41:45.208 --> 41:47.333
No.

41:47.417 --> 41:50.458
He suspects nothing.

41:50.542 --> 41:52.875
When the time is right..

41:52.958 --> 41:56.542
...Ambassador Mollari
will do exactly as we wish.

41:58.542 --> 42:00.917
Destiny is on our side.

42:04.500 --> 42:07.542
[instrumental music]

42:20.083 --> 42:22.917
Nothing's the same anymore.

42:37.083 --> 42:40.167
[music continues]
