13:28.508 --> 13:30.008
I'm sorry.
Have we met?

13:30.010 --> 13:31.342
Yes.

13:31.344 --> 13:33.978
Long time ago.

13:33.980 --> 13:35.313
You're working here now?

13:35.315 --> 13:36.347
Mm-hmm.

13:36.349 --> 13:37.982
It is a teaching hospital.

13:37.984 --> 13:40.151
Would you like me
to teach you something?

13:40.153 --> 13:41.352
(chuckles)

13:41.354 --> 13:42.987
What would that be?

13:42.989 --> 13:44.789
Well, maybe something about

13:44.791 --> 13:48.459
how we practice medicine
here in Wayward Pines.

13:48.461 --> 13:51.529
You were forced to stay away.

13:51.531 --> 13:55.366
It's a difficult time
for everyone.

13:55.368 --> 13:57.202
You didn't know David.
You wouldn't understand.

13:57.204 --> 13:58.469
You weren't here.

13:58.471 --> 14:00.705
Well, you weren't awake yet.

14:00.707 --> 14:02.874
(chuckles)

14:02.876 --> 14:05.643
I hear you're, uh,
back together with your wife.

14:05.645 --> 14:08.713
Must be complicated
for you, hmm?

14:11.651 --> 14:15.220
Must make things interesting
in bed, though, huh?

14:15.222 --> 14:17.388
Sorry?

14:17.390 --> 14:19.524
Well, is it like the first time?

14:19.526 --> 14:21.759
After 2,000 years, I wonder?

14:24.831 --> 14:26.197
Oh!
(laughs)

14:26.199 --> 14:27.732
You haven't re-consummated yet.

14:27.734 --> 14:29.167
I'm so sorry.

14:29.169 --> 14:31.069
You're gonna be pretty
pointless around here

14:31.071 --> 14:32.337
if you don't...
(clicks tongue)

14:32.339 --> 14:34.372
...get to it, you know?

14:34.374 --> 14:36.875
So then, what is your point?

14:36.877 --> 14:38.243
Because I know that
I was not brought

14:38.245 --> 14:40.845
from Hawaii to strictly
service my wife.

14:40.847 --> 14:42.914
Ah, Hawaii.

14:42.916 --> 14:44.883
(chuckles)

14:44.885 --> 14:48.086
That bartender made
such a mean mai tai.

14:48.088 --> 14:49.754
And that's a skill.

14:49.756 --> 14:53.091
Sheriff Hope and I could barely
get up the next morning.

14:53.093 --> 14:55.760
Do you really think
Hawaii was all about you?

14:55.762 --> 14:57.262
(clicks tongue)

14:57.264 --> 15:00.732
Look, I've got a lot

15:00.734 --> 15:02.233
of tidying up to do here,
so maybe we can

15:02.235 --> 15:04.435
chitter-chat later on, hmm?

15:04.437 --> 15:05.904
Yes.

15:05.906 --> 15:08.273
We will.

15:08.275 --> 15:10.241
Have a report on my desk.

15:10.243 --> 15:12.243
Oh, aye, aye, Captain.

15:12.245 --> 15:15.213
(laughs)

15:15.215 --> 15:16.681
(door opens)

15:17.617 --> 15:20.151
(door closes)

15:38.805 --> 15:40.638
PAM:
<i> And so the boy grew.</i>

15:40.640 --> 15:43.775
<i> Exploring and studying,</i>

15:43.777 --> 15:46.711
<i> learning all he could.</i>

15:46.713 --> 15:49.647
<i> But as he grew,</i>

15:49.649 --> 15:52.784
<i> his world started</i>
<i> to feel smaller.</i>

15:52.786 --> 15:55.386
<i> The sky was closer.</i>

15:55.388 --> 15:58.723
<i> The trees seemed to shrink.</i>

15:59.559 --> 16:04.662
<i> The fence felt confining.</i>

16:04.664 --> 16:07.298
<i> He wanted to walk tall.</i>

16:07.300 --> 16:09.600
<i> He wanted to feel distance.</i>

16:09.602 --> 16:13.504
<i>He wanted to explore new lands.</i>

16:19.679 --> 16:22.981
Well, look at that hard work
you're doing.

16:22.983 --> 16:26.684
But the party's
back this way, buddy.

16:26.686 --> 16:28.519
They're not my friends.

16:28.521 --> 16:30.555
You made them come here.

16:31.791 --> 16:33.624
Well, of course,
they wanted to come.

16:33.626 --> 16:37.495
Who wouldn't want to celebrate
the day you were woken?

16:37.497 --> 16:39.163
They don't like me.

16:39.165 --> 16:41.032
Of course, they like you.

16:41.034 --> 16:42.533
Why would you say that?

16:44.504 --> 16:47.171
Jason, you get back
to that party right now!

16:47.173 --> 16:48.840
She's right.

16:48.842 --> 16:51.476
Everybody's waiting for you.

16:51.478 --> 16:53.644
That's just what
I was saying.

16:53.646 --> 16:56.381
You need some convincing,
buddy-- how's this?

16:56.383 --> 17:00.551
Sheriff Pope is bringing
a new ice cream flavor

17:00.553 --> 17:01.853
just for you.

17:01.855 --> 17:03.621
Sounds so yummy, hmm?

17:05.058 --> 17:06.824
Pam, why don't you go back,

17:06.826 --> 17:09.727
and, uh, get started and we'll
be there in just a minute.

17:09.729 --> 17:11.796
Oh, thank you.

17:15.001 --> 17:17.735
You're feeling sorry for
yourself on your birthday, huh?

17:17.737 --> 17:19.003
Yeah, I know how that is.

17:19.005 --> 17:21.439
I've had a few
of those myself.

17:24.077 --> 17:26.744
And I bet she won't take
a sad face as an answer,

17:26.746 --> 17:28.546
now will she?
No way.

17:28.548 --> 17:29.914
Well, you know what, Jason?

17:29.916 --> 17:32.083
Any time you want,
you can come to me.

17:32.085 --> 17:34.185
Okay?

17:34.187 --> 17:36.754
And you, you tell me
what you're thinking,

17:36.756 --> 17:38.256
what you're feeling.

17:38.258 --> 17:39.757
That's my gift to you.

17:39.759 --> 17:42.226
And there's no expiration date.

17:42.228 --> 17:45.263
I don't want anyone
to treat me special.

17:45.265 --> 17:46.898
Well, that's not special.

17:46.900 --> 17:50.535
That's your right
as a son of Wayward Pines.

17:50.537 --> 17:52.570
All of the First Generation
are of Wayward Pines.

17:52.572 --> 17:55.740
Well, but you are the first,
aren't you?

17:55.742 --> 17:58.276
And you're theirs.
Wait.

17:58.278 --> 18:00.411
They're my real parents, right?

18:00.413 --> 18:02.413
Pam and David?

18:02.415 --> 18:05.450
Um... sort of, yes.

18:05.452 --> 18:10.121
And, boy, do they have some
exciting plans for your future.

18:10.123 --> 18:13.624
Now, don't you worry
about those kids.

18:13.626 --> 18:16.461
They are your friends.
(laughing, cheering)

18:16.463 --> 18:18.262
And they know that
one day very soon they will

18:18.264 --> 18:20.264
be standing in line

18:20.266 --> 18:23.034
behind you.

18:25.271 --> 18:27.905
There are exploratory steps
being taken

18:27.907 --> 18:30.808
for our lives
outside Wayward Pines.

18:30.810 --> 18:33.811
Isn't that amazing?

18:33.813 --> 18:37.982
But in order for us to be
the strongest community

18:37.984 --> 18:42.920
that we can be, the most
important steps will be taken

18:42.922 --> 18:45.490
right here
by all of you.

18:45.492 --> 18:48.092
That's right.

18:48.094 --> 18:49.827
Let's put the "pro"

18:49.829 --> 18:52.497
back in "procreation."

18:52.499 --> 18:54.966
Evan, dear?
(children giggling)

18:54.968 --> 18:57.502
We will start

18:57.504 --> 19:00.004
with "K."

19:00.006 --> 19:03.508
(hinges creak)

19:05.311 --> 19:07.311
Lovely.

19:07.313 --> 19:08.946
Mm.

19:08.948 --> 19:10.448
Yes, dear?

19:10.450 --> 19:12.850
I thought we weren't
officially paired

19:12.852 --> 19:14.485
until graduation.

19:14.487 --> 19:17.021
Officially, yes, but,
well, some of your friends

19:17.023 --> 19:18.523
haven't waited that
long, have they?

19:18.525 --> 19:20.291
Right?
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

19:20.293 --> 19:22.360
Raise your hands if you're
already on your way.

19:22.362 --> 19:23.961
Raise your hand.

19:23.963 --> 19:26.297
Before we begin though,

19:26.299 --> 19:27.999
I'd like Dana McKinnie,

19:28.001 --> 19:30.635
Julie Jackson,

19:30.637 --> 19:32.637
Riley Ford and Lucy Armstrong

19:32.639 --> 19:36.007
to gather their things,

19:36.009 --> 19:38.009
and follow me into the hallway.

19:38.011 --> 19:39.911
(students murmuring)

19:41.147 --> 19:42.880
Now, if you four

19:42.882 --> 19:45.183
girls will go down
to the library,

19:45.185 --> 19:48.986
Mrs. Randolph has some special
reading materials for you.

19:48.988 --> 19:50.488
Are we in trouble or something?

19:50.490 --> 19:52.557
Oh, no, honey.

19:52.559 --> 19:56.027
You girls just haven't
experienced your blooming yet.

19:56.029 --> 19:59.063
When you do, you'll be
able to fully participate.

19:59.065 --> 20:01.866
Until then, you study up, okay?

20:01.868 --> 20:03.935
Okay.

20:12.579 --> 20:14.579
Very impressive.

20:14.581 --> 20:16.247
MARIO:
Pilcher would be proud.

20:16.249 --> 20:18.716
(chuckles)

20:18.718 --> 20:22.687
Oh, I'm not so sure
about clearance procedures.

20:22.689 --> 20:24.922
Given your situation,
um, I don't...

20:24.924 --> 20:26.557
You heard Jason.

20:26.559 --> 20:28.926
He wants me to be welcomed back.

20:28.928 --> 20:30.595
You wouldn't want to disobey
orders, would you?

20:30.597 --> 20:31.762
No.

20:31.764 --> 20:33.764
It'll be all right.
Yeah.

20:36.069 --> 20:38.302
(sighs)

21:03.263 --> 21:05.329
♪ ♪

21:26.819 --> 21:29.153
(machines powering up)

21:29.155 --> 21:30.821
(growling)

21:36.829 --> 21:40.064
(growling intensifies, roars)

21:55.148 --> 21:57.515
(sniffing)

21:57.517 --> 21:59.583
(Abbies growling)

22:02.422 --> 22:04.422
(growling continues)

22:05.692 --> 22:08.359
(growling)

22:16.369 --> 22:17.735
Pam?

22:23.843 --> 22:25.042
Oh.
(chuckles)

22:25.044 --> 22:26.544
Here you are.

22:26.546 --> 22:28.379
I wasn't aware

22:28.381 --> 22:30.648
that we had an appointment.
We don't.

22:30.650 --> 22:32.983
Oh.

22:32.985 --> 22:34.819
Are you sure
you're allowed up here?

22:34.821 --> 22:36.320
(laughs softly):
Oh.

22:36.322 --> 22:37.555
Don't be silly.

22:37.557 --> 22:39.523
I...

22:39.525 --> 22:42.493
I am completely impressed
with what you've done up here.

22:42.495 --> 22:45.029
Even in spite of your...

22:45.031 --> 22:47.365
difficulty.

22:47.367 --> 22:50.801
It-it's miraculous you survived.

22:51.738 --> 22:54.405
Yes, it is.

22:54.407 --> 22:55.673
Now I spend my time

22:55.675 --> 22:57.475
studying their habits.

22:58.878 --> 23:02.012
Looking for weak spots
in their genetic code.

23:02.014 --> 23:03.414
It's all very time consuming.

23:03.416 --> 23:04.682
It's very dangerous.

23:04.684 --> 23:05.916
Yes, of course.

23:05.918 --> 23:08.419
Difficult...
(Abby roars)

23:08.421 --> 23:10.888
for a hypnotherapist.

23:10.890 --> 23:12.156
Hmm?

23:14.026 --> 23:15.926
Jason seems to trust you.

23:15.928 --> 23:17.762
And you.

23:17.764 --> 23:19.130
Slim pickings all around.

23:21.033 --> 23:22.433
It's very difficult
to be a leader

23:22.435 --> 23:23.734
in a time of crisis.

23:23.736 --> 23:25.903
It's grueling.

23:25.905 --> 23:29.106
Megan, I know what
my brother meant to you,

23:29.108 --> 23:30.441
(crying):
and I am so sorry

23:30.443 --> 23:33.110
for what I had to do.

23:33.112 --> 23:35.913
I beg you to understand.

23:35.915 --> 23:39.116
I respect that.

23:39.118 --> 23:42.286
But I won't pretend
to welcome you home

23:42.288 --> 23:45.456
like you're some sort of hero.

23:45.458 --> 23:47.558
You think I want to be
congratulated

23:47.560 --> 23:49.960
for what I did?
Maybe you want forgiveness?

23:49.962 --> 23:51.462
Hmm?

23:51.464 --> 23:53.297
Well, you won't get that
from me.

23:53.299 --> 23:55.800
No.

23:55.802 --> 23:57.668
I guess you best be on your way.

24:00.306 --> 24:02.440
(Abbies growling)

24:02.442 --> 24:04.308
You take care, Megan.

24:04.310 --> 24:06.377
(growling intensifies)

24:07.814 --> 24:09.346
(screeching roar, growling)

24:15.922 --> 24:18.022
(roaring)

24:27.099 --> 24:28.532
(knocking on glass)

24:31.003 --> 24:34.004
Hey.

24:34.006 --> 24:35.339
Come on in.

24:41.681 --> 24:43.581
Let me clean you
up a little, Theo.

24:47.520 --> 24:50.020
Pam Pilcher.

24:50.022 --> 24:51.856
What about her?

24:51.858 --> 24:53.357
She said she was in Hawaii

24:53.359 --> 24:54.859
when they took us.

24:54.861 --> 24:58.629
Some of them came here
on their own, you know.

24:58.631 --> 25:01.031
People who believed.

25:01.033 --> 25:02.566
And what about the ones
who didn't?

25:07.039 --> 25:08.706
Where's your ring?

25:08.708 --> 25:10.541
What?

25:10.543 --> 25:12.676
Your wedding ring.

25:12.678 --> 25:14.044
Oh, um...

25:14.046 --> 25:15.746
They never gave it to me.

25:22.321 --> 25:25.222
She also said that...

25:25.224 --> 25:26.790
Hawaii wasn't just about me.

25:29.362 --> 25:30.995
(sighs)

25:30.997 --> 25:33.097
The past is full of holes
for me, too, Theo.

25:38.504 --> 25:40.504
(boys talking, laughing)

25:40.506 --> 25:42.573
(spray paint can hissing)

25:47.680 --> 25:49.213
BOY:
Oh, she's back!

25:49.215 --> 25:51.315
Come on!

25:52.818 --> 25:55.052
(Pam sighs heavily)

25:57.857 --> 25:59.423
(softly):
Well...

25:59.425 --> 26:00.891
that's that then.

26:00.893 --> 26:03.794
(inhales sharply)

26:37.897 --> 26:40.864
(inhales sharply,
shuddering exhale)

27:12.832 --> 27:14.064
(sighs heavily)

27:20.840 --> 27:22.640
I wasn't expecting you out here.

27:22.642 --> 27:24.942
Yeah, yeah, um...

27:24.944 --> 27:26.176
the hospital.

27:26.178 --> 27:29.480
We are perilously short
on staff.

27:29.482 --> 27:32.516
Oh, certainly we can discuss
this tomorrow at the hospital.

27:32.518 --> 27:33.817
(chuckles)

27:33.819 --> 27:36.520
Well, it's been quite a walk.

27:38.624 --> 27:40.024
(sighs)

27:40.026 --> 27:42.559
Hardly requires a
house call, Doctor.

27:43.863 --> 27:45.696
(screen closes)

27:45.698 --> 27:46.997
What was it like

27:46.999 --> 27:49.199
to have to...

27:49.201 --> 27:51.669
beg forgiveness from a child?

27:51.671 --> 27:54.204
(scoffs) 'Cause that's
how you got back, right?

27:54.206 --> 27:55.372
But whatever rule

27:55.374 --> 27:57.808
you broke,
it was a rule you made.

27:57.810 --> 27:59.043
I helped lay the groundwork.

27:59.045 --> 28:01.211
So you had your reasons
for what you did that day.

28:01.213 --> 28:02.646
Invasion Day, right?

28:02.648 --> 28:04.214
That's what you called it.

28:04.216 --> 28:05.649
It wasn't an invasion.

28:05.651 --> 28:09.887
David let them in
and his decision was...

28:09.889 --> 28:11.321
less than wise.

28:11.323 --> 28:12.556
As was mine.

28:12.558 --> 28:13.724
To shoot him in the chest?

28:13.726 --> 28:15.559
Your brother?

28:15.561 --> 28:17.327
Why did you do that?

28:17.329 --> 28:19.329
He'd given up.

28:19.331 --> 28:21.899
His mind had snapped, it...

28:21.901 --> 28:23.967
I-is there something else,
Doctor?

28:25.871 --> 28:28.172
Yes, uh, Hawaii.

28:28.174 --> 28:32.076
You said that...

28:32.078 --> 28:33.744
I wasn't the reason
you were there.

28:33.746 --> 28:35.412
Did I say that?

28:35.414 --> 28:38.215
Mm.

28:38.217 --> 28:41.919
That must've been one hell
of a selection process.

28:41.921 --> 28:47.024
I mean, all that time you
put in choosing people, and...

28:47.026 --> 28:49.393
then you just...

28:49.395 --> 28:50.928
took us.

28:50.930 --> 28:53.764
And here you are, alive.

28:53.766 --> 28:55.099
Well, there were guidelines
that you followed, right?

28:55.101 --> 28:56.066
There must've been.

28:56.068 --> 28:57.367
I mean, who you needed here,

28:57.369 --> 28:59.269
and for reasons why.

28:59.271 --> 29:00.571
Hundreds of doctors in Boston,

29:00.573 --> 29:02.039
yet...

29:02.041 --> 29:03.273
you chose me.

29:03.275 --> 29:06.076
Everyone was chosen
for a reason.

29:06.078 --> 29:08.178
A random doctor?

29:10.249 --> 29:11.849
And an architect?

29:13.385 --> 29:15.986
Thank you so much
for stopping by, Doctor.

29:34.907 --> 29:36.473
(sighs)

29:39.111 --> 29:40.544
(breathes heavily)

29:48.954 --> 29:51.021
(liquid squishing)

29:52.591 --> 29:54.658
(inhales sharply)

30:06.338 --> 30:07.871
Hmm.

30:10.976 --> 30:12.176
Did you find something?

30:12.178 --> 30:14.745
What's<i> Variola major?</i>

30:16.849 --> 30:18.148
Why, is it missing?

30:18.150 --> 30:20.350
Maybe one's missing, I...

30:20.352 --> 30:22.152
Count them again.

30:22.154 --> 30:23.987
I'm calling Dr. Yedlin.

30:23.989 --> 30:25.622
Now, as you know,
Pilcher's plans

30:25.624 --> 30:26.857
are very specific.

30:26.859 --> 30:29.359
He-he made notes about

30:29.361 --> 30:30.661
reclaiming the valley,

30:30.663 --> 30:32.529
going north
for more portable water,

30:32.531 --> 30:34.131
building a bigger perimeter,

30:34.133 --> 30:36.200
but his original intent
is important to me.

30:36.202 --> 30:38.202
We're lucky to have Pam
who can fill us in

30:38.204 --> 30:39.503
on some of the details.

30:39.505 --> 30:40.704
She'll be here soon.

30:40.706 --> 30:43.040
Why?

30:43.042 --> 30:46.210
'Cause I want her to be.

30:46.212 --> 30:48.545
And I want the first group
to go out next week.

30:48.547 --> 30:50.747
That's ambitious.

30:53.552 --> 30:54.885
JASON:
Pam.

30:54.887 --> 30:56.687
Please sit down.

30:56.689 --> 30:59.756
CJ, as far as the crops go,
how to the plans look to you?

31:04.496 --> 31:07.397
CJ: It took time to find the
fertile ground the first time.

31:07.399 --> 31:09.333
We'll cut a wider path,

31:09.335 --> 31:11.335
see if we can try
more variety this time.

31:11.337 --> 31:13.170
Good, good.

31:13.172 --> 31:15.205
Uh, Mario, is there anybody
on your team that...

31:16.342 --> 31:18.075
Dr. Yedlin,
this is a closed meeting.

31:18.077 --> 31:19.509
I want everyone
to get up very slowly

31:19.511 --> 31:20.744
and leave this room.

31:20.746 --> 31:22.646
Don't touch each other,
don't touch anything.

31:25.251 --> 31:26.917
You?

31:26.919 --> 31:28.285
You stay exactly where you are.

31:34.727 --> 31:36.727
JASON: And what is this about?
She got a hold of smallpox.

31:36.729 --> 31:37.895
She took it

31:37.897 --> 31:39.997
from the lab.

31:39.999 --> 31:42.199
THEO: You're so protective of
this town, that you don't want

31:42.201 --> 31:43.901
anything to happen to it?
Fine.

31:43.903 --> 31:45.769
We're gonna run some tests.

31:45.771 --> 31:47.504
I'll decide about tests.

31:47.506 --> 31:48.739
Just one, smallpox.

31:48.741 --> 31:49.907
What do you say?
(scoffs)

31:49.909 --> 31:51.942
We'll sedate you,

31:51.944 --> 31:53.243
and then quarantine you.

31:53.245 --> 31:54.511
That won't be necessary.

31:54.513 --> 31:55.913
THEO:
If she injected herself,

31:55.915 --> 31:57.414
she can infect everyone.

31:57.416 --> 31:58.515
She wants to kill all of us.

32:08.527 --> 32:11.361
Wayward Pines was supposed
to be the salvation

32:11.363 --> 32:12.763
of the human race.

32:12.765 --> 32:13.764
It is.

32:13.766 --> 32:15.933
No, no. It's over.

32:15.935 --> 32:17.167
You're sabotaging us.

32:18.137 --> 32:20.871
Because this is how
this story ends.

32:22.708 --> 32:24.374
Known it ever since
I lost my brother.

32:24.376 --> 32:25.642
You killed your brother.

32:25.644 --> 32:28.145
He killed Ben Burke,
and how many others?

32:30.749 --> 32:31.915
We're turning
against each other.

32:31.917 --> 32:34.551
All we seem to know
is hatred.

32:35.554 --> 32:37.287
CJ, you know this.

32:37.289 --> 32:38.722
Better than anyone.

32:38.724 --> 32:41.258
What you've seen,

32:41.260 --> 32:43.827
what we did.

32:44.797 --> 32:46.830
What happened to the dream?

32:49.134 --> 32:51.335
Sweetie,

32:51.337 --> 32:52.936
I am trying

32:52.938 --> 32:55.639
to give you a gift.

32:55.641 --> 32:58.342
I raised you to be a leader,

32:58.344 --> 33:02.646
and I am begging you
to lead your people

33:02.648 --> 33:04.081
to a peaceful end.

33:06.251 --> 33:07.517
(voice breaking):
I let you in.

33:07.519 --> 33:10.721
And now you have
to deal with me.

33:11.790 --> 33:13.991
Take her.

33:32.478 --> 33:34.478
(footsteps approaching)

33:34.480 --> 33:36.713
JASON:
The Abby threat is contained.

33:36.715 --> 33:38.615
Good.

33:38.617 --> 33:40.384
We won.
Won?

33:40.386 --> 33:42.219
Yes.

33:42.221 --> 33:43.286
The traitors, they're gone.

33:44.356 --> 33:46.690
Kate's toy bomber
and their minions,

33:46.692 --> 33:48.025
I took care of them.

33:48.027 --> 33:49.226
Where's Pilcher?

33:49.228 --> 33:50.660
I wanted to tell you both.

33:50.662 --> 33:52.396
(shuddering breath)

33:52.398 --> 33:54.364
Jason, he...

33:54.366 --> 33:56.333
No.

33:56.335 --> 33:59.870
No, no.
(sobbing)

33:59.872 --> 34:02.572
This is everything
you prepared me for.

34:02.574 --> 34:03.840
No.

34:03.842 --> 34:05.175
You were right.

34:05.177 --> 34:08.045
Their lives
are in my hands.

34:08.047 --> 34:09.413
They took that
for granted.

34:09.415 --> 34:12.182
I had to kill them.

34:12.184 --> 34:13.417
All of them.
No.

34:13.419 --> 34:15.519
In front of each other
on their knees.

34:15.521 --> 34:16.987
What I have done here,

34:16.989 --> 34:18.922
what we have done here,

34:18.924 --> 34:20.190
will be historic.

34:20.192 --> 34:23.527
No, no, no, no, no, no, no,
that's....

34:23.529 --> 34:25.429
that's not
what we want for you.

34:25.431 --> 34:26.863
What do you mean?

34:26.865 --> 34:28.765
How can this be a community

34:28.767 --> 34:30.200
without them standing
in line behind me?

34:30.202 --> 34:32.102
(whimpering groan)

34:32.104 --> 34:34.604
How dare you!
Ow!

34:34.606 --> 34:37.607
It's tragic
to lose any one

34:37.609 --> 34:39.843
of our small number.

34:39.845 --> 34:42.946
(stammers)
And you want to celebrate this?

34:42.948 --> 34:44.448
Become a legend?

34:44.450 --> 34:46.383
No.

34:46.385 --> 34:47.617
No,

34:47.619 --> 34:52.456
that is not the boy we raised.

34:52.458 --> 34:56.593
There is no humanity in murder.

35:01.266 --> 35:03.500
(sighs softly)

35:06.371 --> 35:08.638
Did you always know?

35:08.640 --> 35:10.474
What, baby?

35:10.476 --> 35:11.808
His plan.

35:11.810 --> 35:14.144
That it would fail,
that it would come to this.

35:14.146 --> 35:16.913
I never wanted to believe that.

35:16.915 --> 35:19.049
That's why you're here.

35:19.051 --> 35:21.651
You could still
make the right decision.

35:21.653 --> 35:24.554
What?

35:24.556 --> 35:26.156
Just let all these people die?

35:26.158 --> 35:28.892
You realize how insane
you sound?

35:28.894 --> 35:33.163
Killing us all with smallpox.

35:33.165 --> 35:34.431
You think
I'd let you do that?

35:34.433 --> 35:36.166
I'm a son
of Wayward Pines.

35:36.168 --> 35:39.002
You're not only
a son of Wayward Pines.

35:39.004 --> 35:41.304
What else would I be?

35:41.306 --> 35:43.773
You're mine.

35:43.775 --> 35:45.842
My son.

35:48.013 --> 35:52.682
And I raised you to be
as tenacious as I am.

35:52.684 --> 35:58.188
All that matters to me now
is we fix our mistake.

35:58.190 --> 35:59.956
I won't stop.

35:59.958 --> 36:01.992
I will find a way.

36:02.961 --> 36:05.395
So, baby...

36:06.365 --> 36:09.766
....you can let me die
of smallpox,

36:09.768 --> 36:11.535
or you can kill me.

36:27.052 --> 36:30.053
THEO:
She didn't infect anyone.

36:30.055 --> 36:31.354
She's still within
the incubation period.

36:35.060 --> 36:38.795
You saved the town,
Dr. Yedlin.

36:38.797 --> 36:40.864
You're a hero.

36:42.501 --> 36:46.036
Maybe they'll
appreciate you for it.

36:47.172 --> 36:50.574
We can administer
the antidote now.

36:50.576 --> 36:52.642
That's not your
decision to make.

37:08.093 --> 37:10.994
PAM: You remember the
story I used to tell you?

37:10.996 --> 37:13.230
JASON:
The story of Wayward Pines.

37:13.232 --> 37:15.498
PAM:
Your story.

37:15.500 --> 37:18.101
JASON:
You never told me the ending.

37:18.103 --> 37:20.270
Did you have one?

37:20.272 --> 37:22.038
PAM:
Doesn't matter.

37:22.040 --> 37:23.607
Fairy tales aren't real.

37:23.609 --> 37:26.576
It was just my fantasy
of what this place should be.

37:29.281 --> 37:32.616
I never told you
the reality of the horror.

37:35.220 --> 37:38.788
(softly):
Okay.

37:38.790 --> 37:40.957
All right.

37:40.959 --> 37:43.026
The boy was grown.

37:44.363 --> 37:46.896
And he looked at his town...

37:46.898 --> 37:50.700
and he knew it was his
to do with as he pleased.

37:53.639 --> 37:56.206
Then he wanted more,

37:56.208 --> 38:00.310
but the "more"
belonged to the creatures.

38:00.312 --> 38:02.479
When he realized this,

38:02.481 --> 38:04.314
he felt all alone.

38:04.316 --> 38:08.451
And became very, very sad.

38:09.421 --> 38:12.088
(crying):
And in his sorrow,

38:12.090 --> 38:15.225
he remembered
just how special he was.

38:17.262 --> 38:20.330
So he closed his eyes,

38:20.332 --> 38:23.767
and he wished...

38:23.769 --> 38:25.769
for grace.

38:25.771 --> 38:27.804
(Pam gasps)

38:46.191 --> 38:47.691
(sobs quietly)

39:02.040 --> 39:04.107
(door opens)

39:14.553 --> 39:17.053
Is it done?

39:17.055 --> 39:20.190
We should talk about who's
going out in the first group.

39:22.127 --> 39:24.227
I don't want to lose the most
valuable people here,

39:24.229 --> 39:27.564
but we need experts
in the field.

39:27.566 --> 39:30.400
CJ, he'll insist on going.

39:30.402 --> 39:32.235
An engineer would be good.

39:32.237 --> 39:33.503
And additional military.

39:33.505 --> 39:34.738
Jason.

39:36.742 --> 39:38.975
Do you want to talk
about what happened?

39:56.762 --> 39:58.428
REBECCA:
Hi.

39:58.430 --> 39:59.829
Hey.

40:05.337 --> 40:07.337
You okay?

40:07.339 --> 40:10.273
(soft chuckle)

40:10.275 --> 40:12.342
No.

40:16.782 --> 40:19.449
I keep looking
for my watch.

40:20.719 --> 40:22.685
As if time means
anything here.

40:27.359 --> 40:30.126
I never got a gift
from my father

40:30.128 --> 40:31.528
in my life.

40:31.530 --> 40:35.298
No presents for Christmas,
birthdays, nothing.

40:35.300 --> 40:39.469
Then when my mom died,

40:39.471 --> 40:41.304
after the service,

40:41.306 --> 40:44.407
went to shake his hand,

40:44.409 --> 40:47.744
and he took off his watch,

40:47.746 --> 40:50.113
his retirement watch
for 40 years on the dock.

40:52.651 --> 40:55.652
"O'Clancy's, 5:30."

40:58.256 --> 41:01.825
I'd never had a beer
with my dad in my life.

41:01.827 --> 41:03.092
So I...

41:03.094 --> 41:05.495
show up and there he is.

41:05.497 --> 41:08.731
Two beers there.

41:10.435 --> 41:11.668
So, every Thursday,

41:11.670 --> 41:14.504
5:30.

41:14.506 --> 41:16.840
That was our standing date.

41:16.842 --> 41:19.909
So I'd been wondering

41:19.911 --> 41:23.947
what happened
that first Thursday

41:23.949 --> 41:26.616
at 5:31,

41:26.618 --> 41:29.185
when he used the cell phone
that I gave him,

41:29.187 --> 41:31.087
which he hated so much,
to call me,

41:31.089 --> 41:33.823
(sniffles) and of course there
was no answer because...

41:36.361 --> 41:39.295
...I was gone.

41:39.297 --> 41:42.098
And when was it that
he called the police,

41:42.100 --> 41:45.034
or how long he waited?

41:45.036 --> 41:46.769
Did he go back
that next Thursday?

41:52.611 --> 41:54.043
I know you can't
think about that

41:54.045 --> 41:55.979
because if it consumes you,

41:55.981 --> 41:58.314
you would not be able
to go on with your day,

41:58.316 --> 42:01.551
but you need to
know that...

42:03.555 --> 42:06.155
...I'll never forget that.

42:06.157 --> 42:08.625
(sniffling)

42:22.807 --> 42:25.241
(classical music playing)

42:25.243 --> 42:27.310
