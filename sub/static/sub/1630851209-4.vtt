Nadja from Antipaxos! Hello!

07:53.451 --> 07:55.540

"Ring-a-ding-ding" a lot.

07:55.584 --> 07:57.803
-Ring-a-ding-ding!
-Which is one
of their catchphrases.

07:57.847 --> 07:59.805
It's Nadja! Do you remember?!

07:59.849 --> 08:01.154
All right.

08:01.198 --> 08:02.547
NADJA:

So, who do you guys

08:18.563 --> 08:20.652
-[clears throat]
-I understand

08:20.696 --> 08:22.611
you're indicating
that you want me to proceed.

08:22.654 --> 08:24.264
But I'm still assessing
my cards,

08:24.308 --> 08:25.788
which is within my right.

08:25.831 --> 08:28.834
Rodriguez, of course,
has that uppercut.

08:28.878 --> 08:32.142
But Jackson has the reach.
70 inches. That's no slouch.

like this, to be honest.

08:38.104 --> 08:39.279
Let's go. Come on.

08:39.323 --> 08:42.152
I am playing a game called

08:42.195 --> 08:43.632
The Big Bang Theorygame.

08:43.675 --> 08:45.547

a classic match.
