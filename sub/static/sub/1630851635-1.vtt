A lot can happen in two months.

07:41.294 --> 07:42.796
which she did not--

07:42.837 --> 07:44.631
she can't prove it's me.

08:43.106 --> 08:45.525
If you're looking for Phys Ed,
that's in the gym,

08:45.567 --> 08:47.402
and I recommend you leave now.

08:47.444 --> 08:48.987
Physics tells us
that the universe

08:49.029 --> 08:51.698
is governed by immutable laws--

08:51.740 --> 08:53.241
kind of like my classroom.

08:53.283 --> 08:54.909
If you break my laws,

08:54.951 --> 08:57.245
you'll find out that
for every boneheaded action,

08:57.287 --> 08:59.664
there is an equal
and opposite reaction.

08:59.706 --> 09:03.084
[phone ringing]

09:04.127 --> 09:05.462
- Bronwyn,

09:05.503 --> 09:08.048
how good of you to help me
demonstrate this concept.

09:08.089 --> 09:09.632
Is this yours?

09:09.674 --> 09:12.010
- Uh, yes, but my phone's
in my locker.

09:12.052 --> 09:13.845
- Open it.
[ringing continues]

09:19.934 --> 09:22.062
- This--this isn't my phone.
[ringing]

09:22.103 --> 09:25.899
- Your action was to bring
a cell phone into class.

09:25.940 --> 09:28.234
And my equal
and opposite reaction

09:28.276 --> 09:29.277
is to give you detention.

09:29.319 --> 09:30.528
- What?

09:30.570 --> 09:32.072
That's not fair because
that's not my phone.

09:32.113 --> 09:32.864
- It is fair.

09:32.906 --> 09:34.157
And it's final.

09:34.199 --> 09:36.034
You can have your phone back
after detention.

09:36.076 --> 09:38.620
- [muffled] Okay, people,
let's open our books now.

09:44.167 --> 09:45.752
You ready to school me

09:45.794 --> 09:47.003
- So ready.

09:47.045 --> 09:48.171
[inhales]

09:48.213 --> 09:50.090
I just have to make
a quick stop first.

09:50.131 --> 09:51.925
- Okay, cool.
- In detention.

09:53.510 --> 09:55.178
[signs]
- Bronwyn Rojas.

09:55.220 --> 09:56.763
Detention
on the first day of school?

09:56.805 --> 09:58.223
- It's a total
misunderstanding.

09:58.264 --> 10:00.058
Can you tell Ms. Fox
I'll be late?

10:00.100 --> 10:01.142
- Sure.

10:01.184 --> 10:02.811
Uh, I'm gonna stop by
the cafeteria.

10:02.852 --> 10:04.145
Lemon Snapple?

10:05.271 --> 10:06.398
- You're the best.

10:17.617 --> 10:18.743
- Bronwyn.

10:18.785 --> 10:20.120
I'm flattered.
I, uh--

10:20.161 --> 10:21.705
I didn't know you were a fan.

10:21.746 --> 10:23.790
- I'm not.
That was a hate read.

10:23.832 --> 10:25.417
- Oh, that's a shame.

10:25.458 --> 10:27.168
Out of everyone,
I thought you would get it.

10:27.210 --> 10:28.503
- Get what?

10:28.545 --> 10:30.130
- That I'm doing
a public service.

10:30.171 --> 10:31.798
You don't think girls
deserve to know

10:31.840 --> 10:33.466
that Reggie has a camera
hidden above his bed?

10:33.508 --> 10:35.343
- Oh, so it's a feminist app?

10:35.385 --> 10:37.470
You're like a teenage
Ronan Farrow?

10:37.512 --> 10:39.681
- Oh, so you do get it.

10:40.348 --> 10:42.517
- Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have somewhere to be.

10:42.559 --> 10:44.477
- Huh, small world.

10:44.519 --> 10:45.562
Me too.

10:45.603 --> 10:48.023
[bell rings]

10:50.275 --> 10:51.651
- Congratulations.

10:51.693 --> 10:53.945
You're the only five students
in this entire school

10:53.987 --> 10:56.531
who could still get detention
every day this year.

10:56.573 --> 10:57.741
In my experience,

10:57.782 --> 10:59.117
the students who get detention

10:59.159 --> 11:01.244
on the first day of school
end up here a lot.

11:01.286 --> 11:04.080
So we might as well
get to know each other.

11:04.122 --> 11:06.958
I want you to write an essay
introducing yourselves

11:07.000 --> 11:09.044
and reflecting
on what you did to get here.

11:09.085 --> 11:11.838
There will be no talking,
no passing notes,

11:11.880 --> 11:13.131
and no more doodling.

11:13.173 --> 11:14.215
- Ms. Avery,

11:14.257 --> 11:15.759
I know you didn't
believe me in class,

11:15.800 --> 11:17.177
but that phone you found
wasn't mine,

11:17.218 --> 11:19.596
so I technically
don't belong here.

11:20.722 --> 11:23.350
- Oh, no, Bronwyn would never
intentionally break the rules.

11:23.391 --> 11:24.434
- No, I wouldn't.

11:24.476 --> 11:25.727
And I didn't.

11:26.895 --> 11:28.438
See? My phone's right here.

11:28.480 --> 11:30.899
- Did you seriously bring
another phone into detention?

11:30.940 --> 11:32.400
Hand it over.
- I'm sorry, but

11:32.442 --> 11:34.444
doesn't the fact that you're
confiscating my phone twice

11:34.486 --> 11:35.612
seem weird to you?

11:35.653 --> 11:38.031
I mean, why would anyone
have two phones?

11:38.073 --> 11:40.200
- Well, I can think of
a few reasons.

11:41.409 --> 11:42.744
What about you, Nathan?

11:42.786 --> 11:43.870
- What's your problem, man?

11:43.912 --> 11:44.913
- With you?

11:44.954 --> 11:46.665
Oh, I think you know.
- Enough.

11:46.706 --> 11:48.667
Papers and pens out.

11:48.708 --> 11:50.710
- If I'm gonna
stay here unfairly,

11:50.752 --> 11:52.087
could I at least
use my computer?

11:52.128 --> 11:54.381
I try to avoid paper
for environmental reasons.

11:54.422 --> 11:56.758
- Oh, well,
I try to avoid devices

11:56.800 --> 11:58.259
that connect to the Internet

11:58.301 --> 12:00.387
for "making sure that you
actually do your work" reasons.

12:00.428 --> 12:02.180
- But I, uh--
- Oh, another word,

12:02.222 --> 12:03.682
and you'll have detention
again tomorrow.

12:03.723 --> 12:06.267
And I don't think either of us
really wants that, do you?

12:07.519 --> 12:09.187
How are there more questions,
Simon?

12:09.229 --> 12:10.980
This is
a very simple assignment.

12:11.022 --> 12:12.857
- I just need to go get
my water from my locker.

12:12.899 --> 12:15.902
- No, you can go 45 minutes
without water.

12:15.944 --> 12:17.237
- Well, actually, no, I can't.

12:17.278 --> 12:19.739
I have xerostomia.
It's a medical condition

12:19.781 --> 12:21.074
where my salivary glands
underperform.

12:21.116 --> 12:22.575
- Yeah,
I know what dry mouth is.

12:22.617 --> 12:25.120
You may get a cup of water
from the water cooler.

12:25.161 --> 12:26.496
- The cups have--
- And no,

12:26.538 --> 12:29.082
I don't care that the cups
are made out of paper,

12:29.124 --> 12:29.958
Bronwyn.

12:30.000 --> 12:31.626
What I do care about

12:31.668 --> 12:34.629
is that everybody is quiet
and doing their work.

12:34.671 --> 12:35.797
It's 1,000 words,

12:35.839 --> 12:37.507
so I recommend
that you start now.

have sex with jocks,

13:41.905 --> 13:44.157
- Well, it's not about them.

13:44.199 --> 13:45.992
It's about the principle
of the thing.

13:46.034 --> 13:47.619
- The principle.

25:04.212 --> 25:05.922

relationship with Simon.

25:05.964 --> 25:07.257
Were the two of you friendly?

25:07.298 --> 25:08.758

25:08.800 --> 25:10.510
I moved here last year
for baseball.

25:10.552 --> 25:12.929
- You went to
the nurse's office yesterday

25:12.971 --> 25:14.597
before Simon died.

25:14.639 --> 25:16.099
Why?
- I didn't.

- You have a probation officer.

25:21.813 --> 25:22.939
Why is that?

25:22.981 --> 25:24.691
- I'm pretty sure it says why

25:24.733 --> 25:25.775
in the file you're holding.

25:25.817 --> 25:27.235
- I'd like to hear
your version.

25:27.277 --> 25:29.362
- My version is that
I sold drugs to rich kids,

25:29.404 --> 25:30.488
and then I got caught.

25:30.530 --> 25:31.740
- I understand you and Simon

25:31.781 --> 25:33.325
were numbers one and two
in your class.

25:33.366 --> 25:34.451
Were you competitive?

25:34.492 --> 25:35.744
- Um, maybe a little.

25:35.785 --> 25:37.871
We both definitely wanted
valedictorian.

25:37.912 --> 25:39.956
- You transferred
from Mississippi.

25:39.998 --> 25:41.416
- Baseball the only reason
for the move?

25:41.458 --> 25:44.044
- Yeah, I want to be able
to play year-round.

25:44.085 --> 25:45.378
It's better
for getting recruited.

25:45.420 --> 25:46.504

anything to do

25:52.260 --> 25:53.970
A third would mean doing time.

25:54.012 --> 25:56.014

He didn't have

about the rest of us.

was his business.
