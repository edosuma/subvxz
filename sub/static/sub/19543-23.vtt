WEBVTT

00:02.419 --> 00:04.125
Using the Taiyo-ken technique,

00:04.213 --> 00:07.376
Kuririn and the others eluded Dodoria.

00:07.466 --> 00:11.425
Vegeta then appeared before Dodoria.

00:13.931 --> 00:19.676
His rebellion against Freeza and
his men grew even more vehement.

00:27.986 --> 00:30.898
Dokkan Dokkan We're in luck

00:30.989 --> 00:34.072
Dokkan Dokkan Paradise

00:34.159 --> 00:38.198
The Genki Dama bursts away

00:38.288 --> 00:41.621
Go Go Let's do it

00:42.835 --> 00:48.626
There's a wriggling, mysterious energy

00:48.716 --> 00:54.586
I won't hold back, just you watch

00:54.680 --> 01:00.550
l'll protect you with my life

01:00.644 --> 01:06.731
Turn your courage to love into strength

01:06.817 --> 01:12.733
We'll overcome crises with carry-through spirit

01:12.823 --> 01:19.991
The tougher your opponent is,
the greater the excitement

01:21.331 --> 01:24.198
Dokkan Dokkan We're in luck

01:24.293 --> 01:27.501
Dokkan Dokkan Now's our chance

01:27.588 --> 01:33.128
Whooshing along on the lucky wind

01:33.218 --> 01:36.085
Dokkan Dokkan We're in luck

01:36.180 --> 01:39.343
Dokkan Dokkan Tomorrow, as well

01:39.433 --> 01:46.475
Your soul already knows the answer

02:08.836 --> 02:10.622
I've killed Dodoria.

02:10.714 --> 02:15.674
For all the power that Dodoria
prided himself on, it was easy.

02:15.761 --> 02:19.504
I've improved so much, even I am surprised.

02:19.598 --> 02:23.682
That battle on Earth was
indeed good for something.

02:23.769 --> 02:27.637
Although I have to admit,
Dodoria did say something unusual.

02:27.731 --> 02:32.191
| get it! Those runts I was chasing
were earthlings, weren't they?

02:33.737 --> 02:37.275
True, I do sense two large powers
getting farther away from me.

02:37.366 --> 02:41.075
They couldn't possibly be
earthlings, but it does bother me.

02:41.161 --> 02:43.698
Maybe I should go check them out.

02:43.789 --> 02:46.826
Whoever they are, l have to eliminate
anyone who might get in my way,

02:46.917 --> 02:48.908
even the small fry.

02:55.926 --> 02:59.714
The cave where Bulma-san is hiding
is just a little farther that way.

02:59.805 --> 03:03.639
This is your first time on this planet.
I'm surprised you know it so well.

03:03.725 --> 03:07.013
What's that?! Something's
coming at incredible speed!

03:08.897 --> 03:10.228
Hide! Hurry!

03:10.315 --> 03:11.851
R-Right!

03:14.194 --> 03:17.106
They're going to find us, out here
in a place like this, aren't they?

03:17.197 --> 03:19.529
Never mind, just suppress your Ki, right now!

03:19.616 --> 03:21.902
We'll have to leave the rest up to fate.

03:23.036 --> 03:26.119
Is it that monstrous-looking bastard again?

03:26.206 --> 03:30.415
Damn it, how did he figure out where we are?

03:32.880 --> 03:35.496
Both of those powers have disappeared.

03:35.591 --> 03:37.547
What's going on?

03:37.634 --> 03:39.841
It happened right around there, abruptly.

03:48.020 --> 03:50.432
Kuririn-san! Up there!

03:56.987 --> 04:02.402
V-Vegeta! So he really is here on this planet.

04:04.578 --> 04:09.914
How can it be that he's here?
This is a complete disaster!

04:18.634 --> 04:20.464
He's still looking around.

04:20.552 --> 04:24.795
He wasn't wearing one of those Scouter devices.

04:24.890 --> 04:27.757
So how can he tell where we are?

04:29.102 --> 04:32.560
Y-You don't think he's gained
the ability to sense Ki, do you?

04:32.648 --> 04:35.936
If so, this is bad. Even with us suppressing our Ki,

04:36.026 --> 04:38.233
this kid still has his slight Ki...

04:41.073 --> 04:43.610
Damn, have I misread things?

04:43.700 --> 04:46.567
It might be because I'm not used to
this power-sensing technique yet.

04:46.662 --> 04:50.200
Maybe I shouldn't have destroyed that Scouter.

04:50.290 --> 04:53.202
Hmm? I sense a small power.

04:53.293 --> 04:57.127
This time, I'm not misreading it. Now to find it...

04:57.214 --> 04:58.704
He's coming this way!

04:58.799 --> 05:02.417
I-It's hopeless! He's gonna find us!

05:02.511 --> 05:05.753
Around that rock there.

05:05.847 --> 05:08.384
At this point, we have no choice but to fight.

05:22.906 --> 05:24.862
--Let's go!
--Right!

05:27.202 --> 05:28.738
Now!

05:40.215 --> 05:42.126
A fish, huh?

05:44.845 --> 05:45.960
Oh, well.

05:46.054 --> 05:48.670
Right now, getting my hands on
the two remaining Dragon Balls--

05:48.765 --> 05:52.883
no, even just one of them, comes first.

05:52.978 --> 05:55.139
If I can just hide one of them,

05:55.230 --> 05:59.269
Freeza will be unable to get
all seven of them together.

06:01.069 --> 06:03.105
Then I'll wait for Freeza and the
others to leave themselves open,

06:03.196 --> 06:06.108
and take their five from them.

06:07.409 --> 06:13.621
Having them lose their Scouters
means that luck is on my side!

06:21.590 --> 06:23.922
We're saved!

06:24.009 --> 06:26.625
I thought we'd had it for sure, there.

06:26.720 --> 06:30.963
We sure got lucky. I've gotta
hand it to that thing in the water.

06:32.893 --> 06:35.384
Anyhow, let's head back to where Bulma-san is,

06:35.479 --> 06:37.595
while keeping our presence
as masked as we can.

06:37.689 --> 06:40.021
--|t's right nearby, isn't it?
--Yes.

06:40.108 --> 06:42.690
We didn't even fight,
and I already feel exhausted.

06:42.778 --> 06:44.689
I want to get some rest.

06:55.290 --> 06:57.781
l'm
, uh

06:57.876 --> 07:03.337
l'm honestly beginning to wish
we hadn't come to this planet.

07:03.423 --> 07:06.540
I know that's not fair to the late
Yamucha-san and the others.

07:06.635 --> 07:09.251
But far from bringing everyone back to life,

07:09.346 --> 07:11.883
it looks like there are going
to be even more deaths.

07:11.973 --> 07:14.180
Do you mean us?

07:15.143 --> 07:16.883
Mm-hmm.

07:20.357 --> 07:23.724
Look, Kuririn-san! Over there!

07:23.819 --> 07:25.730
Oh, right, right.

07:25.821 --> 07:27.527
Bulma-san!

07:30.534 --> 07:31.819
Huh? She's not here.

07:31.910 --> 07:34.947
She must be hiding further inside the cave.

07:36.790 --> 07:38.746
Bulma-san!

07:38.834 --> 07:43.919
It's us! Where are you?! Bulma-san!

07:47.384 --> 07:49.375
A Capsule House!

07:54.724 --> 07:58.342
What have you been off gallivanting around for?!

07:58.436 --> 08:02.145
Leaving a young lady here, all by herself!

08:03.608 --> 08:05.690
Gallivanting, she says.

08:06.736 --> 08:09.694
Who's the small-sized
Piccolo-looking fellow there?

08:09.781 --> 08:12.944
By any chance, is that a Namekian?

08:13.034 --> 08:14.490
It's all right.

08:14.578 --> 08:17.536
Eh? Did something happen?

08:17.622 --> 08:20.034
Please, just let us come inside right now.

08:20.125 --> 08:22.366
We'll tell you everything that happened.

08:22.460 --> 08:23.916
Oh, right!

08:24.004 --> 08:27.337
| just got some welcome news from my dad!

08:27.424 --> 08:31.337
Son-kun has taken off, and is
headed here to Planet Namek!

08:31.428 --> 08:34.340
And get this, he'll arrive in just six days!

08:35.390 --> 08:37.381
You see, my dad took the spaceship

08:37.475 --> 08:41.844
that Son-kun rode in on when he was
a baby and completely rebuilt it!

08:41.938 --> 08:47.149
What's more, Son-kun is going to
undergo incredible training inside!

08:48.778 --> 08:51.030
F-Father is coming?

08:53.491 --> 08:56.358
--Hooray!
--Yahoo!

08:56.453 --> 08:59.115
Undergoing incredible training, you say?

08:59.206 --> 09:02.414
Great! Great! Now we have some hope!

09:07.547 --> 09:10.960
Next up, this, for 30 minutes!

09:23.563 --> 09:28.023
l'm sensing them! Large powers!
There are at least 20 of them!

09:28.109 --> 09:30.566
No doubt about it, there's a
Namekian village out there!

09:30.654 --> 09:34.112
And they probably have a Dragon Ball.

09:36.576 --> 09:39.192
Freeza and the others don't have Scouters.

09:39.287 --> 09:44.077
No matter what action I take now,
they won't know about it!

09:50.757 --> 09:54.625
I knew it. The folks in this village are still alive,

09:54.719 --> 09:57.961
which proves that Freeza and
the others haven't been here yet.

10:05.772 --> 10:08.514
--What's this?
--An alien.

10:08.608 --> 10:10.599
Is your elder here?

10:10.694 --> 10:13.731
l have come to get your Dragon Ball.

10:13.822 --> 10:16.108
W-What?!

10:17.867 --> 10:20.028
lam the elder.

10:20.120 --> 10:23.954
Would you mind telling me
why you want the Dragon Ball?

10:24.040 --> 10:27.157
Never mind, just hand it over,
right now! You do have it, right?

10:27.252 --> 10:31.291
Leave us. I cannot give it to you.

10:31.381 --> 10:34.498
I can sense evil coming from you.

10:35.927 --> 10:37.758
Then die.

10:41.474 --> 10:42.850
Bang!

10:42.934 --> 10:44.470
Elder!

11:17.135 --> 11:21.925
Eat up. Don't be so reserved.
It's not all that great, though.

11:24.726 --> 11:28.935
You can't blame him. Most of
his village just got killed, right?

11:29.022 --> 11:32.389
Oh, right. This isn't really the time to eat, huh?

11:32.484 --> 11:36.602
We don't eat this sort of thing.
We get by just drinking water.

11:36.696 --> 11:40.109
Get out of here! There were
fields around your village,

11:40.200 --> 11:42.532
and you were growing vegetables,
or something, weren't you?

11:42.619 --> 11:44.735
Those were Ajissa saplings.

11:44.829 --> 11:46.330
Ajissa saplings?

11:46.414 --> 11:50.657
Yes. Long ago, before the climatic anomaly,

11:50.752 --> 11:56.042
Namek was supposedly a pretty world,
dense with Ajissa trees.

11:56.132 --> 11:58.384
But then...

11:58.468 --> 12:01.175
...the Ajissa forests, along with us Namekians,

12:01.262 --> 12:03.878
almost completely died out.

12:05.141 --> 12:08.508
So now, we're increasing the
number of Ajissa trees there are,

12:08.603 --> 12:11.140
in an attempt to make Namek beautiful again.

12:11.231 --> 12:14.439
Say, what's your name?

12:14.526 --> 12:19.691
Dende. Um, who are you people, exactly?

12:22.200 --> 12:25.192
K-Kuririn-san, is that...?

12:30.834 --> 12:34.122
What's going on, all of a sudden?
ls someone coming again?

12:34.212 --> 12:37.625
N-No, it's not that.

12:41.386 --> 12:44.549
There are Ki out there,
diminishing, one after another.

12:44.639 --> 12:49.724
T-The Namekians are being killed once again.

12:49.811 --> 12:54.225
T-The one doing the killing is
someone we know quite well.

12:54.315 --> 12:58.149
Vegeta! He's attacking a different village now!

12:58.236 --> 13:01.319
W-What an awful bunch those guys are!

13:01.406 --> 13:06.116
S-Sure enough, Vegeta has
learned a technique to sense Ki.

13:06.202 --> 13:07.237
This is a problem!

13:07.328 --> 13:10.456
We'll have to watch how we move
around until Goku shows up.

13:10.540 --> 13:16.331
I'm not sure if Vegeta and that
Freeza fiend are working together,

13:16.421 --> 13:19.288
but if either one of them use the
Dragon Balls to gain eternal life,

13:19.382 --> 13:20.918
it would be the end of the world!

13:21.009 --> 13:25.048
If we were to find just one of
the Dragon Balls, and hide it,

13:25.138 --> 13:28.380
they won't be able to get
all seven of them together.

13:28.475 --> 13:30.636
We can't! If we did that,

13:30.727 --> 13:34.345
they would keep looking, until they
had killed all of the Namekians!

13:34.439 --> 13:36.725
O-Oh, no!

13:36.816 --> 13:40.354
This sucks, no matter what happens.

13:40.445 --> 13:46.736
E-Even once Goku gets here, there's
no guarantee that he can beat them.

13:46.826 --> 13:48.441
Damn!

13:50.747 --> 13:54.331
If only I'd finished off Vegeta when I could...

13:54.417 --> 13:58.660
P-Please tell me more about yourselves.

13:58.755 --> 14:02.964
Where did you come from? How do
you know about the Dragon Balls?

14:03.051 --> 14:06.964
P-Please save the people of my world!

14:15.438 --> 14:19.681
Why, you...! How could you do this?!

14:23.196 --> 14:27.405
You aren't going to hand over the
Dragon Ball, no matter what, huh?

14:27.492 --> 14:31.155
I'll be damned if I give it to you!

14:31.246 --> 14:33.953
You are one utterly stubborn old man.

14:34.040 --> 14:37.658
Okay, then, suit yourself. I'll find it on my own.

14:41.506 --> 14:43.167
Wait!

14:53.184 --> 14:55.800
Grate on me, will you?!

14:59.899 --> 15:04.188
Here I thought it would be hidden,
but there it is, on grand display.

15:05.905 --> 15:10.569
This Kami-sama guy was a
Namekian who had fled to Earth.

15:10.660 --> 15:13.652
We want to use the Dragon Balls here

15:13.746 --> 15:17.079
to bring our fallen friends back to life.

15:17.166 --> 15:18.827
If our wish is granted right,

15:18.918 --> 15:21.159
the Dragon Balls on Earth will return, as well.

15:21.254 --> 15:23.870
S-So that's what's going on, is it?

15:23.965 --> 15:28.584
I've finally unraveled the
mystery of who you are.

15:28.678 --> 15:35.345
Please, come with me!
I will show you to the Grand Elder!

15:36.728 --> 15:38.810
Grand Elder?

15:38.896 --> 15:40.602
Who's the Grand Elder?

15:40.690 --> 15:44.649
T-The one who gave birth
to all of us here on Namek.

15:44.736 --> 15:48.069
The sole survivor of the
climatic anomaly long ago,

15:48.156 --> 15:51.489
who has once again given vitality to Namek.

15:51.576 --> 15:55.410
I am the Grand Elder's 108th child.

15:55.496 --> 16:00.866
The sole survivor? How is it
that you folks have children?

16:00.960 --> 16:05.624
How? We lay eggs out of our mouths.

16:05.715 --> 16:08.878
Oh, is that right? That's unusual, huh?

16:08.968 --> 16:12.631
S-So then, the Grand Elder is a female, right?

16:12.722 --> 16:16.306
Female? What's a female?

16:16.392 --> 16:22.103
W-What is it? There are two kinds of
Namekians, right? Male and female.

16:22.190 --> 16:27.435
Let's see, for example... you have
your father, and then your mother.

16:27.528 --> 16:32.022
Two kinds? N-No...

16:32.116 --> 16:34.448
Did you hear that? They don't
have males and females.

16:34.535 --> 16:40.280
What a dull planet. I'm glad I'm not Namekian.

16:40.375 --> 16:42.832
Er, never mind that, tell us,

16:42.919 --> 16:46.457
why are we going to the Grand Elder's place?

16:46.547 --> 16:52.338
The people who attacked our village
already had four Dragon Balls.

16:52.428 --> 16:56.091
A-And you said a lot of people were just killed

16:56.182 --> 16:59.345
over in that direction, right?

16:59.435 --> 17:02.973
Y-Yeah, probably by a guy named Vegeta.

17:03.064 --> 17:05.680
There isn't a single Ki remaining there.

17:05.775 --> 17:08.686
They were probably completely wiped out.

17:08.778 --> 17:13.693
In that case, there aren't very many
Namekians left on this world.

17:13.782 --> 17:18.321
R-Right. If Vegeta found the
Dragon Ball in the village he attacked,

17:18.413 --> 17:21.701
that means there's only one left.

17:21.790 --> 17:25.282
By any chance, does the
Grand Elder have the last one?

17:25.377 --> 17:27.039
Y-Yes.

17:27.130 --> 17:28.586
Oh, no!

17:28.673 --> 17:30.914
Freeza may have lost his Scouters,

17:31.008 --> 17:34.045
but Vegeta has gained
the ability to search for Ki!

17:34.137 --> 17:35.377
If he searches for his Ki,

17:35.471 --> 17:37.962
he'll arrive at the Grand
Elder's place before long,

17:38.057 --> 17:40.639
and steal the seventh Dragon Ball from him!

17:40.727 --> 17:45.266
T-Then we have to let the
Grand Elder know at once!

17:45.356 --> 17:48.018
I beg you! I beg you!

17:48.109 --> 17:51.476
If either Freeza or Vegeta
are granted eternal life,

17:51.571 --> 17:54.233
it would be awful!

17:54.323 --> 17:58.236
All right. Let's hurry. Show me the way.

17:58.327 --> 17:59.703
Right!

17:59.787 --> 18:02.324
I'll go see the Grand Elder with Dende.

18:02.415 --> 18:05.373
Gohan, you and Bulma-san wait here for me.

18:05.460 --> 18:07.917
There's no point in all of us going, is there?!

18:08.004 --> 18:10.620
All right. Be careful.

18:11.841 --> 18:15.800
Remember, Gohan, you guys be careful, too!

18:15.887 --> 18:17.423
Right!

18:22.894 --> 18:24.805
Now then...

18:32.195 --> 18:36.939
If I submerge this Dragon Ball here,
no one will be able to find it.

18:37.033 --> 18:40.025
I'm the only one who knows it's here.

18:42.163 --> 18:46.657
Freeza and the others have five Dragon Balls.

18:46.751 --> 18:49.538
I guess I'll go look for the last one.

19:01.891 --> 19:05.179
Dodoria is far too late in returning.

19:05.269 --> 19:08.557
Could he still be pursuing those unusual runts?

19:08.648 --> 19:09.888
Never mind.

19:09.982 --> 19:13.941
If the fool cannot catch those
two kids, then leave him be.

19:14.028 --> 19:17.566
Never mind him, go and find
the last two Dragon Balls.

19:17.657 --> 19:20.524
Yes, sir, as you wish. If we
search the remaining villages,

19:20.618 --> 19:23.155
the Dragon Balls are sure to be there.

19:23.246 --> 19:24.827
With the two of us searching,

19:24.914 --> 19:27.621
we should at least be able to find their villages.

19:27.708 --> 19:30.085
Then, I shall take these five Dragon Balls,

19:30.169 --> 19:32.876
and wait for you back at the spaceship.

19:34.632 --> 19:36.497
I am counting on you.

19:36.592 --> 19:40.551
Once we have just two more of them,
I can have my wish granted.

19:40.638 --> 19:42.219
Yes, sir.

19:43.683 --> 19:45.469
You look over in that direction.

19:45.560 --> 19:48.973
If you find a village, do nothing,
and come let me know.

19:49.063 --> 19:52.772
If there are any strong Namekians,
you won't be able to handle them.

19:52.859 --> 19:55.976
We'll meet up again in three hours,
back at the spaceship.

19:56.070 --> 19:57.571
Yes, sir.

20:02.952 --> 20:08.618
It could be that Vegeta has already
located the two that remain.

20:08.708 --> 20:12.576
Even so, he will likely be
coming after our Dragon Balls.

20:12.670 --> 20:16.754
That could be good, and save us
the bother of having to find him.

20:16.841 --> 20:18.172
Once Vegeta comes after them,

20:18.259 --> 20:19.920
we will turn the tables,
and take his two from him.

20:20.011 --> 20:23.094
By doing so, we shall have
all seven of them together.

20:24.473 --> 20:28.466
And then I shall be given eternal life.

20:33.441 --> 20:34.556
Now then,

20:34.650 --> 20:38.142
to wait at my leisure in the spaceship.

20:45.494 --> 20:48.827
Vegeta seems to have grown
even stronger than before.

20:48.915 --> 20:52.783
And I sensed an even stronger
Ki from that Freeza guy.

20:52.877 --> 20:54.663
I don't know what kind of
training Goku is going through,

20:54.754 --> 20:56.915
but this time, even he might
not be able to handle them.

20:57.006 --> 21:00.999
In any case, let's get the Dragon
Ball that the Grand Elder has,

21:01.093 --> 21:05.006
and hide for the five and a half
days it will take for Goku to arrive.

21:05.097 --> 21:08.885
After that, all we can do is wait
for Goku to work a miracle.

21:08.976 --> 21:12.184
If I'm getting so I'm expecting
miracles, it's all over, huh?

21:12.271 --> 21:16.810
Tch, I didn't have any female
presence in my life at all.

21:16.901 --> 21:20.519
Planet Namek faces a worst-case scenario.

21:20.613 --> 21:25.778
Finally, Vegeta has also gone into
motion, seeking the Dragon Balls.

21:25.868 --> 21:30.157
Is their only hope to wait for Goku's arrival?

21:31.916 --> 21:34.828
Yeah! Break! Care! Break! As hard as you can

21:34.919 --> 21:39.413
Fly away into the boundless skies

21:39.507 --> 21:42.340
We'll hitch a ride on the jet stream,

21:42.426 --> 21:45.463
and zip away to wherever we want

21:45.554 --> 21:47.806
Being a daredevil is the best

21:47.890 --> 21:51.223
Let's go tip-top! All right?

21:51.310 --> 21:57.101
This eye-opening blue Earth of ours

21:57.191 --> 22:03.278
is our irreplaceable world,
and we're not giving it up

22:04.657 --> 22:07.615
Blast offa Kamehame-Ha

22:07.702 --> 22:10.865
You were born

22:10.955 --> 22:16.575
to protect the world in these uncertain times

22:16.669 --> 22:19.581
Yeah! Break! Care! Break! As hard as you can

22:19.672 --> 22:22.789
Go at it full power

22:22.883 --> 22:26.842
Hope is my weapon,

22:26.929 --> 22:30.171
so believe in the future

22:34.395 --> 22:35.976
Heya! I'm Goku!

22:36.063 --> 22:38.520
All right, I'm getting accustomed
to 20-times gravity.

22:38.607 --> 22:43.101
Hey, Goku, brace yourself.
I've had some visitors come by.

22:43.195 --> 22:46.562
Visitors? Kaio-sama, now ain't the right time.

22:46.657 --> 22:49.865
Now, just a second.
You know these four quite well.

22:49.952 --> 22:51.408
Four?

22:51.495 --> 22:53.360
Next time on Dragon Ball Z Kai,

22:53.456 --> 22:57.290
"Friends Reborn! The Beautiful Warrior
Zarbon's Devilish Transformation. "

22:57.376 --> 23:00.288
Piccolo-san, I can't wait to see you!
