FILM 9

01:08.680 --> 01:13.760
<i>No child has ever died</i>
<i>from a mother’s embrace.</i>

01:54.560 --> 01:56.200
We agreed we’d tolerate him

01:56.280 --> 01:59.880
as long as the negative effects
are balanced out by any good he brings.

02:00.720 --> 02:02.600
Now the scales have tipped.

02:03.840 --> 02:06.000
From the beginning,
we knew this wasn’t forever

02:06.080 --> 02:08.320
and that there won’t be a pension
for his years of service.

02:09.840 --> 02:11.720
But why have you decided it’s time?

02:13.240 --> 02:15.600
I’m his friend, as strange as that sounds.

02:16.280 --> 02:20.280
I want him out
before it’s too late for him and us.

02:21.600 --> 02:23.040
He’s out of control.

02:24.000 --> 02:26.000
Does your daughter think so too?

02:28.440 --> 02:29.560
Yes.

02:32.080 --> 02:33.680
Okay, I’ll think about it.

02:34.600 --> 02:37.520
When he flies off the handle,
can you imagine what’ll happen?

02:37.600 --> 02:39.080
Are you prepared to risk it?

04:13.760 --> 04:15.160
Did you like it?

04:15.840 --> 04:16.720
What?

04:18.519 --> 04:20.120
You know what I’m talking about.

04:23.160 --> 04:25.160
Are you asking if I’m a sadist?

04:25.920 --> 04:29.080
Just be honest… if you’re not afraid.

04:35.920 --> 04:38.120
Deep down inside, yes, I liked it.

04:40.440 --> 04:41.840
It scares me.

04:43.080 --> 04:44.360
Why?

04:48.480 --> 04:49.800
After all, isn’t it…

04:51.400 --> 04:52.600
terrible?

04:56.520 --> 04:58.120
Are you asking me?

05:05.600 --> 05:06.920
How was it?

05:13.280 --> 05:14.960
It was like I’d been electrified.

05:17.720 --> 05:19.720
It was like sex, but better.

05:24.120 --> 05:25.440
You poor thing.

05:27.360 --> 05:29.360
What kind of men have you run into?

06:05.240 --> 06:06.840
<i>Do you feel it?</i>

06:08.400 --> 06:09.600
<i>I love you.</i>

06:30.720 --> 06:32.360
A question about authority.

06:33.320 --> 06:36.000
How did Meglin act toward his superiors?

06:36.080 --> 06:39.360
I mean his character, his behavior.

06:39.440 --> 06:42.280
What did he think of us, the higher-ups?

06:44.560 --> 06:47.440
Do you really believe
that you’re superior to him?

06:58.800 --> 07:03.840
MOSCOW

07:17.560 --> 07:19.120
She was strangled.

07:19.640 --> 07:22.120
No signs of sexual assault.

07:22.200 --> 07:24.480
She was six, coming home from school.

07:27.120 --> 07:28.040
Excuse me, dear.

07:31.320 --> 07:33.880
I’ve been looking at this for 18 years.

07:34.480 --> 07:35.600
And you aren’t weary of it?

07:41.120 --> 07:42.920
The Chinese are great, aren’t they?

07:43.880 --> 07:45.080
They make everything--

07:45.680 --> 07:47.600
clothes, cars, computers.

07:48.160 --> 07:51.080
One of my friends
gave his son a Chinese robot.

07:51.160 --> 07:53.360
It runs, jumps, and does push-ups.

07:55.320 --> 08:00.560
We need to tell the Chinese that Russians
need a robot that can do two things:

08:00.640 --> 08:02.960
listen and drink.

08:03.640 --> 08:04.840
What do you see?

08:06.000 --> 08:07.960
The ring is in her hand,
not on her finger.

08:08.920 --> 08:10.600
He gave it to her.

08:11.800 --> 08:13.520
Is that how he lured her in?

08:13.600 --> 08:14.960
Keep going.

08:15.040 --> 08:16.280
No signs of struggle.

08:17.280 --> 08:18.880
Her clothes aren’t torn.

08:20.520 --> 08:24.200
She came here with him herself.
She didn’t resist.

08:25.080 --> 08:28.000
Why? Does she know him?

08:34.039 --> 08:35.360
Let’s go.

08:57.560 --> 09:02.080
Find out if the lock was broken or opened
with a key in the previous murder.

09:06.600 --> 09:07.800
POLICE

09:07.880 --> 09:09.640
-Long life to you!
-May I…

09:11.160 --> 09:13.000
-What’s your name?
-Gena.

09:13.080 --> 09:16.240
Go on, Gena, rack your troubled mind.

09:16.320 --> 09:19.720
Two girls were found dead in a basement. The locks to the basements aren’t damaged.
They were opened with a key.

09:23.280 --> 09:26.520
Only the locksmith has a key.
That means you.

09:26.800 --> 09:29.520
-Are you a pedophile?
-What are you talking about?

09:30.200 --> 09:32.000
You think I touched a kid?

09:32.680 --> 09:35.920
-I was born and raised on these streets.
-Born and raised. What else?

09:36.000 --> 09:38.360
Tell us how you lured the girls
to the basement.

09:38.440 --> 09:39.240
With rings!

09:39.320 --> 09:41.640
-What’s with you, pal?
-Who’s your pal here?

09:42.480 --> 09:44.360
What’s a roofie doing in your bag?

09:44.960 --> 09:46.440
Roofies. I get it.

09:46.520 --> 09:48.760
You need money,
and you’re too lazy to get laid.

09:48.840 --> 09:50.800
What’d you do--
put them in a first-grader’s ice cream? My mother is sick and can’t walk.

09:52.920 --> 09:55.800
The doctor wrote her a prescription.
I have it!

09:55.880 --> 09:58.160
-I’ll show you!
-Okay, we’ll verify that.

10:01.400 --> 10:03.160
Gen, do you drink?

10:04.200 --> 10:06.800
Yeah, your mother can’t walk.
Anyone would drink.

10:07.720 --> 10:09.680
I drink. It doesn’t matter if you know.

10:09.760 --> 10:11.600
There you go. That’s a dialogue.

10:11.680 --> 10:13.240
So you drink till you pass out?

10:13.720 --> 10:15.360
Don’t be shy. It takes one to know one.

10:16.400 --> 10:18.080
By day, you get an eyeful.

10:18.160 --> 10:20.280
Comes the evening,
you throw some coal in the furnace

10:20.360 --> 10:22.160
and you wake up
like last night never existed.

10:22.240 --> 10:23.560
It happens like that, right?

10:25.040 --> 10:29.080
Maybe you got drunk that morning and
don’t remember what you did to the girls.

10:29.160 --> 10:32.280
-If that’s true, then fucking kill me!
-Yeah.

10:32.360 --> 10:34.800
Then who’s going to sit with your mother,
me?

10:36.080 --> 10:38.560
Who’d you give the keys to
when you were drunk?

10:39.200 --> 10:40.200
Think.

10:40.280 --> 10:43.160
I didn’t give them to anyone.
They’re at my house.

10:43.240 --> 10:45.240
Who’d you take home?

10:45.320 --> 10:47.760
No one. I live with Mama in a one-bedroom.

10:47.840 --> 10:51.160
It’s not me, I’m telling you.
I’ll swear on anything!

10:51.680 --> 10:54.680
Understood.
Gennady doesn’t remember anything.

10:55.280 --> 10:57.920
Vodka has a lot of pluses,
but there’s one negative.

10:58.600 --> 10:59.880
You don’t remember, Gena!

11:00.440 --> 11:02.400
Although, in a way, that’s also a plus.

11:03.240 --> 11:04.400
Yes.

11:04.920 --> 11:07.080
He can’t talk. He’s busy.

11:10.160 --> 11:11.320
One second.

11:11.400 --> 11:14.880
They have a suspected serial killing.
They’re asking for a consultation.

11:19.280 --> 11:20.320
Shoot me the address.

11:28.160 --> 11:29.600
What do you have here?

11:31.200 --> 11:34.920
The investigator left.
He had to wash his car.

11:35.000 --> 11:36.480
He’ll be here soon.

11:36.560 --> 11:37.920
Where did he go?

11:38.000 --> 11:40.480
Well, he didn’t expect you to be so fast.

11:46.120 --> 11:47.120
CIRCUS

11:48.520 --> 11:51.560
-She was a magician’s assistant.
-My colleague.

11:54.040 --> 11:56.400
She lived alone, no relatives.

11:56.480 --> 12:01.120
She’d been here a couple of days.
Then the neighbor boy called the police.

12:01.760 --> 12:03.280
He bought groceries for her.

12:05.200 --> 12:06.600
We have a witness.

12:07.600 --> 12:10.320
-Probably expensive.
-A rare type of cockatoo.

12:10.400 --> 12:11.520
Really?

12:11.600 --> 12:13.760
It’s all clear.
She was murdered because of the bird.

12:13.840 --> 12:18.120
The thief offed grandma
and then washed her for unknown reasons.

12:18.200 --> 12:19.360
Correct?

12:19.440 --> 12:21.600
Do you know why
they hang the cage below eye level?

12:21.680 --> 12:22.480
Why?

12:22.560 --> 12:24.720
If you put it above, they’ll be scornful.

12:24.800 --> 12:26.920
-And if it’s below?
-They’ll be scared.

12:27.320 --> 12:30.040
Are you scared of me? Or scornful?

12:30.120 --> 12:33.240
Getting a parrot to say its first word
is the hardest part. Then it’s--

12:34.840 --> 12:35.960
easier.

12:36.040 --> 12:38.000
Like with people in interrogations.

12:38.080 --> 12:40.400
It can’t be!

12:40.880 --> 12:43.360
-It was you who called us?
-Well, yeah.

12:44.120 --> 12:45.640
It’s the second one already.

12:45.720 --> 12:48.360
Elderly women with no signs of violence.

12:48.880 --> 12:51.480
Both were by themselves,
so I made the connection.

12:51.560 --> 12:53.320
What did you do?

12:53.400 --> 12:54.840
I tied them into a serial killing.

12:56.360 --> 12:57.600
Zhenya, my classmate.

12:59.560 --> 13:02.000
Major Meglin Rodion.

13:03.080 --> 13:04.280
Hello.

13:05.040 --> 13:06.160
Nice to meet you.

13:06.760 --> 13:09.600
I’ve heard a lot about you.
It’s a huge honor.

13:09.680 --> 13:11.360
What’s with grandma-- taking a swim?

13:11.440 --> 13:15.520
You know, I applied to train with you,
but Esenya beat me out.

13:15.600 --> 13:18.360
What did you tie together there, Zhen?
Mittens?

13:18.440 --> 13:20.240
Well, Evgeny, shall we test you?

13:21.840 --> 13:23.600
What do you see?

13:23.680 --> 13:27.120
Yes, it was a competition. But how else
would you want it? Life is a battle.

13:28.520 --> 13:29.520
Well…

13:31.240 --> 13:33.160
-Well, what?
-Well…

13:33.240 --> 13:36.280
Like I told you. It’s the second one--
an elderly woman in a bathtub.

13:36.360 --> 13:39.840
They were bathing, fell asleep
doing old-people things and drowned.

13:41.200 --> 13:43.800
I’m not asking you what you think.
I’m asking you what you see.

13:46.760 --> 13:47.480
Tell me.

13:47.560 --> 13:49.440
I won’t discuss the pose.

13:49.520 --> 13:51.800
She wouldn’t have lain down like that.
It’s uncomfortable.

13:52.800 --> 13:54.880
And the slippers and the robe…

13:56.440 --> 13:58.640
There are no robe or slippers here.

13:58.720 --> 14:01.320
Exactly. How did she get here?

14:01.920 --> 14:03.720
She didn’t come here.
She was brought here.

14:03.800 --> 14:06.040
Oh! I’ve raised my replacement.

14:06.120 --> 14:09.000
In good spirit,
the seasoned veteran passes the torch.

14:09.600 --> 14:10.960
Everything’s much simpler.

14:21.880 --> 14:23.600
It’s cold. She wasn’t bathing.

14:25.360 --> 14:28.600
Who’s the notice on the door for?

14:29.280 --> 14:30.920
It’s for you.

14:31.000 --> 14:34.480
“Sorry,
the hot water will be cut off for a week.”

14:34.560 --> 14:36.440
So that’s to say I’m right.

14:36.520 --> 14:39.560
If they were drowned,
it means it’s a serial killing.

14:41.440 --> 14:44.760
-Of course it’s a serial, Evgeny.
-And the saucers by the bed.

14:47.400 --> 14:48.280
And the saucers.

14:48.360 --> 14:49.880
Registration.

14:50.480 --> 14:52.480
Registration.

14:52.560 --> 14:55.080
That means the doctor visited her
the day she died.

14:55.160 --> 14:57.240
There’s a plate for the ampoules.

14:57.320 --> 15:00.160
Find him and talk to him.
Maybe he remembers something.

15:00.240 --> 15:03.440
And find out if the same doctor
visited the first old woman.

15:03.520 --> 15:05.680
I need information on the first case.

15:06.280 --> 15:09.120
-Ho! What, are you giving me orders?
-Yes.

15:09.720 --> 15:10.920
How sexy.

15:11.520 --> 15:13.080
Do it right now. -I hear you, boss.
-Get to work.

15:14.800 --> 15:17.320
Comrade Major!
Do you need a second trainee?

15:18.360 --> 15:19.480
Or a first.

15:19.560 --> 15:22.720
I’d love to, but she says
she won’t share me with anyone.

15:22.800 --> 15:23.600
She’s possessive.

15:24.640 --> 15:27.040
-Yeah, she’s like that.
-Like what?

15:31.320 --> 15:33.040
Sergeant, can I take the witness?

15:33.120 --> 15:35.360
-Why?
-Why? To interrogate him.

15:36.680 --> 15:37.920
You want to take him?

15:38.000 --> 15:40.760
Who else will take care of the orphan?
Here you go, my pretty.

15:40.840 --> 15:43.520
Are you sure? He isn’t a cactus.
You have to feed him.

15:43.600 --> 15:45.600
That means I’ll give him to someone…

15:47.640 --> 15:49.320
who’s trustworthy.

15:51.280 --> 15:53.480
Here, sunshine.

15:53.560 --> 15:54.560
Yes.

15:58.040 --> 15:59.240
I understand.

16:00.640 --> 16:03.400
-They got Egorova sobered up.
-And who’s that?

16:03.920 --> 16:05.360
The girl’s mother.

16:16.760 --> 16:19.560
I don’t understand.
I told the police everything!

16:19.640 --> 16:21.240
Why are you questioning me?

16:22.280 --> 16:24.160
What kind of girl was she?

16:27.520 --> 16:29.440
An ordinary, good girl.

16:30.320 --> 16:33.080
I don’t understand. What’s it matter?
What do you need?

16:33.560 --> 16:35.080
Ordinary, huh?

16:35.160 --> 16:38.120
She wasn’t different… in any way?

16:38.200 --> 16:39.800
There wasn’t anything special about her?

16:41.200 --> 16:42.680
She was a normal child. She was a good student.

16:49.080 --> 16:50.680
I didn’t even help her.

16:51.720 --> 16:53.720
Well, she had some health problems.

16:53.800 --> 16:55.840
Who doesn’t have health problems?

16:55.920 --> 16:57.440
What was wrong with her?

17:12.079 --> 17:14.800
She had-- She had psychological issues.

17:15.920 --> 17:19.760
She’d get up at night
and walk around with her eyes open.

17:20.400 --> 17:23.560
She broke the lock.
I found her out on the street once.

17:26.839 --> 17:29.760
The doctor said it’s sleepwalking.
She’ll outgrow it.

17:30.320 --> 17:32.040
He prescribed some pills.

17:32.640 --> 17:35.760
At school, they teased her,
called her stupid. At the playground too.

17:36.840 --> 17:40.080
But she didn’t pay any attention to them.
She’d sit there,

17:40.760 --> 17:43.080
reading in a corner, oblivious.

17:43.960 --> 17:46.800
-What time did she get home from school?
-What?

17:47.800 --> 17:50.720
What time did your daughter come home?
It’s a simple question.

17:52.160 --> 17:54.960
-She came home after classes!
-At what time?

18:00.920 --> 18:02.800
Do you have other children?

18:03.560 --> 18:04.880
Nastya was my only child.

18:05.680 --> 18:06.880
Thank God!

18:08.400 --> 18:10.880
-Is that her drawing?
-Yes, hers!

18:10.960 --> 18:12.560
I’m taking it.

18:13.560 --> 18:14.600
Let’s go.

18:48.760 --> 18:51.040
-How much are the rings?
-100 rubles.

18:51.120 --> 18:53.880
-For one?
-No, for the whole thing. There are five.

18:55.760 --> 18:57.360
The Chinese are great.

18:58.520 --> 19:00.240
-Do you have 100 rubles?
-Get ready.

19:01.600 --> 19:04.000
-Come on, one more time.
-No.

19:10.960 --> 19:12.280
So, what now?

19:13.400 --> 19:16.320
Sit for now. Observe.

19:26.040 --> 19:28.240
WATCH REPAIR - CLOSED

19:33.960 --> 19:37.080
We’re not working, only returning.
We aren’t accepting repairs.

19:37.160 --> 19:39.360
Wait. Where’s the owner?

19:39.440 --> 19:40.520
What’s going on?

19:40.600 --> 19:42.680
We agreed to meet.
He won’t pick up the phone.

19:43.520 --> 19:44.520
The owner went missing.

19:46.320 --> 19:48.360
-How’d he go missing?
-He didn’t make it home.

19:48.440 --> 19:50.960
He won’t answer the phone.
We already told the police.

20:35.520 --> 20:36.840
Now pick someone.

20:37.440 --> 20:38.640
Who?

20:39.480 --> 20:41.360
Someone to give the ring to.

20:44.080 --> 20:46.480
-How should I choose?
-How does he choose?

20:47.240 --> 20:48.440
Like a hunter.

20:49.280 --> 20:50.680
Look for a victim.

21:05.720 --> 21:07.760
That girl there by the swing.

21:09.800 --> 21:11.000
Why?

21:12.480 --> 21:14.560
Because all the children are in groups,

21:15.160 --> 21:17.720
but she’s like a castaway,
alone, without a friend.

21:21.680 --> 21:24.800
You asked how not to be a victim.
Stay in a pack.

21:35.400 --> 21:36.920
He kills them by day.

21:37.000 --> 21:39.280
They went to the basement
without making a racket.

21:40.480 --> 21:42.480
-They believe in him.
-Do they know him?

21:42.560 --> 21:44.800
-More likely, he knows them.
-What do you mean?

21:46.680 --> 21:48.000
Hi!

21:48.080 --> 21:49.560
-Did you lose your ring?
-Where?

21:49.640 --> 21:51.560
It was hidden there behind your ear.

21:51.640 --> 21:53.000
-Thank you.
-You’re welcome.

21:53.080 --> 21:54.520
-Do you want one for your mama?
-Yes.

21:54.600 --> 21:56.560
-Where do you live, in Number 9?
-In Number 14.

21:56.640 --> 21:58.440
-Close by. What’s your name?
-Lera.

21:58.520 --> 21:59.960
Lera. Valeria.

22:00.040 --> 22:05.360
Lera, have you really not been taught
that you shouldn’t talk to strangers?

22:05.440 --> 22:07.400
-You learned that, didn’t you?
-Yes!

22:07.480 --> 22:11.360
So you’re not listening
when they try to teach you something, huh?

22:11.440 --> 22:13.720
-What?
-Why are you watching us?

22:13.800 --> 22:16.240
-Is that your child?
-It’s our child. Identify yourself.

22:17.560 --> 22:19.000
Have you been sitting here long?

22:19.080 --> 22:21.720
After the first girl,
we sat here for two months.

22:21.800 --> 22:23.720
-Now it’s happened again.
-Understood.

22:23.800 --> 22:26.640
Take the child home, okay?

22:26.720 --> 22:27.920
I’m at my post.

22:28.000 --> 22:29.840
You’re not at your post today.
He’s not coming.

22:29.920 --> 22:32.760
If something happens, blame me.
Here’s a ring for you, Valeria.

22:32.840 --> 22:34.240
And remember what I told you.

22:34.320 --> 22:37.520
This guy will take you home.
Understand? Go home.

22:45.200 --> 22:46.200
Stop!

22:48.520 --> 22:51.120
What about the houses around the park?
Quickly.

22:51.840 --> 22:55.760
Across the road, there are residences,
a trail, garages, and a health clinic.

22:56.400 --> 22:57.600
A health clinic.

22:58.360 --> 22:59.360
Thank you.

23:05.560 --> 23:06.720
A health clinic.

23:10.280 --> 23:13.000
You said he knows them
but they don’t know him.

23:13.080 --> 23:15.760
He’s not dumb enough
to take a risk with acquaintances.

23:16.240 --> 23:18.720
Does he follow them,
dig up information on them?

23:18.800 --> 23:20.120
It’s easier than that.

23:20.200 --> 23:23.520
“Nastenka, you’re bothered by nightmares.
Vasily Ivanich told me all about you.”

23:23.600 --> 23:27.120
Or “Lenochka, do you sleepwalk?
Do they call you stupid?

23:27.200 --> 23:29.280
They’re the stupid ones.
You’re my smart girl.”

23:29.360 --> 23:31.120
Do you want some coffee?

23:31.800 --> 23:32.800
It doesn’t work.

23:32.880 --> 23:37.200
“My smart girl, come with me.
I’ll help you.” Something like that.

23:38.120 --> 23:40.960
-Is it possible he’s a doctor?
-Why wouldn’t he be?

23:41.040 --> 23:44.400
Look how convenient it is to go
to the park from the clinic during lunch.

23:44.480 --> 23:48.080
Sandwich, yogurt. Sitting and watching
plainclothes men searching for him.

23:48.160 --> 23:49.320
Beautiful.

23:49.400 --> 23:52.640
Thus the long break
between the first and second murders.

23:53.720 --> 23:55.680
Not just that. He can show restraint.

23:55.760 --> 23:57.600
He doesn’t give in. He’s patient.

23:57.680 --> 23:59.680
He’s patient, and then he attacks.

24:01.480 --> 24:02.880
What’s with the coffee machine?

24:05.000 --> 24:08.480
He didn’t want to kill the girls.
He just stored them away.

24:10.120 --> 24:12.720
Because they weren’t the one
he’s looking for.

24:16.600 --> 24:19.280
-Where are you going?
-See you tomorrow!

24:24.000 --> 24:26.000
POLICE

24:31.960 --> 24:35.040
I checked.
No doctor officially visited the victims.

24:35.120 --> 24:38.240
This is interesting. Pictures of the first
victim’s apartment-- Grafko’s.

24:38.320 --> 24:39.840
Do you see the bedside table?

24:39.920 --> 24:41.120
I see. A saucer.

24:41.200 --> 24:45.920
I verified that both Grafko and Borisyuk
had been checked in at Municipal Clinic 3.

24:47.480 --> 24:49.120
Is that the one near the park?

24:50.120 --> 24:51.520
Give it here.

24:59.560 --> 25:01.120
When were the pictures taken?

25:01.840 --> 25:02.840
On the ninth.

25:04.360 --> 25:05.760
I’m taking them for now.

25:09.160 --> 25:10.640
What did you see in them?

25:12.240 --> 25:14.440
Comrade Major, will you tell me something?

25:31.400 --> 25:32.480
Hi.

25:34.280 --> 25:35.640
Select something.

25:35.720 --> 25:36.920
No thanks.

25:38.600 --> 25:39.760
Excuse us.

25:41.240 --> 25:43.040
Go ahead and tell me your news.

25:46.560 --> 25:49.880
I… don’t want to make any accusations,

25:49.960 --> 25:52.440
but, in my opinion, it’s really strange

25:52.520 --> 25:57.240
that he went missing
exactly the day after he agreed

25:57.320 --> 26:01.240
to work on the sketch of the guy
who visited Prazdnichny.

26:02.680 --> 26:05.840
That is, you want to say… he killed him?

26:05.920 --> 26:07.960
Well, that’s what I assume.

26:09.520 --> 26:12.280
Clearly. If this watchmaker isn’t found,

26:12.360 --> 26:14.120
then that’s it--
our last lead is a dead end.

26:14.200 --> 26:16.320
No, Esen. Well…

26:16.800 --> 26:18.400
These so-called cold cases--

26:18.480 --> 26:23.800
it’s just a matter of lack of time
or skill or manpower.

26:23.880 --> 26:25.280
Well, laziness. Understand?

26:25.360 --> 26:27.800
Criminal investigation is a science.

26:27.880 --> 26:31.240
If you’re good at it,
there won’t’ be any unsolved crimes.

26:31.760 --> 26:34.760
Sasha, why are you trying to convince me?

26:34.840 --> 26:36.480
I’m a legal professional, after all.

26:38.120 --> 26:41.960
He’s here. He exists. We know that now.

26:42.040 --> 26:43.080
He’s starting to panic.

26:43.160 --> 26:44.880
If he’s panicking, then I’ll find him.

26:44.960 --> 26:46.960
Who will you find, Sash?

26:49.280 --> 26:51.480
Anya’s real killer.

26:56.880 --> 26:58.880
What a good, sweet person you are.

27:21.400 --> 27:22.600
What do you think?

27:23.600 --> 27:25.400
What do you think?

27:28.000 --> 27:29.400
I’ll give you a minute.

27:34.240 --> 27:36.400
The photos were made on the ninth,

27:36.480 --> 27:38.920
so Grafko was killed on the sixth.

27:40.160 --> 27:41.640
Within about a month…

27:42.720 --> 27:45.080
Borisyuk was killed, also on the sixth.

27:47.960 --> 27:50.720
-The breaks between the murders--
-Which murders?

27:51.320 --> 27:54.120
-What do you mean which murders?
-Which murders?

27:56.560 --> 27:58.640
The first girl was killed on the seventh,

27:58.720 --> 28:01.880
and Nastya Egorova
was also killed on the seventh.

28:01.960 --> 28:04.200
-Think.
-Why are you talking about the girls?

28:05.520 --> 28:06.360
Wait.

28:09.160 --> 28:11.200
In the same district, on the next day…

28:11.280 --> 28:14.480
In the same district,
on the next day after the murder. Right?

28:15.800 --> 28:17.120
Wait, you mean to say…

28:17.200 --> 28:21.560
I mean to say he’s killing little girls
the day after he kills the old women.

28:21.640 --> 28:24.440
It’s one and the same person.

28:24.520 --> 28:26.280
Where are you going, huh?

28:53.760 --> 28:55.680
So, guys, come on.

28:59.120 --> 29:01.000
So, well…

29:01.640 --> 29:03.240
There are no signs of a break-in.

29:03.320 --> 29:06.240
And no signs of a struggle or a robbery.

29:06.800 --> 29:08.960
You were called here for nothing.

29:09.040 --> 29:11.360
She probably drowned
because she wasn’t careful.

29:11.440 --> 29:14.000
Postcards from three years ago.
She had no one.

29:14.080 --> 29:16.800
-She was afraid to die alone.
-She was afraid for no reason.

29:16.880 --> 29:18.080
In what way?

29:21.680 --> 29:22.440
What?

29:22.520 --> 29:24.600
-The old lady couldn’t move around well.
-Sit.

29:25.200 --> 29:26.240
What’s that?

29:26.320 --> 29:28.640
Yeah, some insignificant information.

29:28.720 --> 29:32.560
Basically, a neighbor said
that she couldn’t walk on her own.

29:32.640 --> 29:35.440
-A social worker helped her.
-Did you establish time of death?

29:36.160 --> 29:38.520
Yes. The experts say around yesterday.

29:38.600 --> 29:39.960
“Around yesterday” or yesterday?

29:41.000 --> 29:42.680
-Yesterday, yes.
-Yesterday?

29:42.760 --> 29:44.640
That means
a girl’s going to be killed today.

29:57.120 --> 29:58.440
The lock isn’t broken.

29:58.960 --> 30:01.360
If she couldn’t walk,
how could she open the door?

30:02.880 --> 30:04.200
Good question.

30:16.200 --> 30:18.360
That’s delicious tea, Gen.

30:19.160 --> 30:22.040
-All in all, you got lucky with your son.
-Yes.

30:22.120 --> 30:24.640
After all,
I’m raising this ungrateful youth now.

30:25.120 --> 30:28.200
We raise them, go without sleep,
get them on their feet.

30:28.280 --> 30:30.160
But what’ll happen to us?

30:30.240 --> 30:33.600
Who’ll bring us… a glass of water?
Who knows?

30:35.440 --> 30:37.800
So, tell me…

30:39.160 --> 30:41.200
when your son had a day off,

30:41.280 --> 30:44.280
when he went camping with his friends,
were you scared?

30:45.760 --> 30:47.480
What do you think, son?

30:47.560 --> 30:50.160
I had such cramping,
I thought, “That’s it.”

30:50.240 --> 30:51.880
I don’t want to call him.

30:51.960 --> 30:55.160
-He doesn’t have a life because of me.
-Calm down.

30:55.240 --> 30:58.920
And then I was thinking, as soon
as he comes, this will have passed.

30:59.360 --> 31:02.640
But I called Emergency, of course,
just in case.

31:03.520 --> 31:05.160
I gave the doctor 100 rubles.

31:05.760 --> 31:06.880
It’s not a lot, of course.

31:06.960 --> 31:10.040
After all, you can’t not give anything.
He’s just a poor fellow.

31:10.120 --> 31:12.600
Yes, the little Hippocratic Oath.

31:12.680 --> 31:14.320
But he gave me a shot.

31:14.920 --> 31:18.240
It relaxed me,
and I even fell asleep, thank God.

31:18.320 --> 31:24.160
But I told Gena.
How he scolded me for not calling him.

31:25.520 --> 31:27.400
It turns out you’re a good man.

31:27.840 --> 31:30.320
Forgive me
for not seeing that immediately.

31:31.040 --> 31:32.720
Well, really…

31:32.800 --> 31:34.520
It’s your job.

31:34.600 --> 31:37.000
Mom, they’re searching for a killer.

31:39.440 --> 31:40.640
Oh, Lord.

31:41.480 --> 31:42.360
My dear,

31:43.080 --> 31:45.440
what,
you couldn’t find yourself another job?

31:46.040 --> 31:48.000
She wanted to be closer to me.

31:48.080 --> 31:50.120
Love, you know, is a vice.

31:50.200 --> 31:51.200
That’s the truth.

31:51.280 --> 31:53.600
What was the doctor’s name?
Do you remember his last name?

31:55.520 --> 31:57.080
I have a bad memory.

31:57.640 --> 32:01.360
I’ve already forgotten both your names.

32:02.880 --> 32:05.120
But here, he left me a prescription.

32:05.960 --> 32:06.760
There you go.

32:07.040 --> 32:09.280
The receipt. Here you go.

32:13.400 --> 32:14.400
Gen.

32:15.280 --> 32:17.280
Are these your keys to the basements.

32:18.040 --> 32:21.120
Half are for the apartments,
half are for the basements.

32:22.480 --> 32:25.520
No, don’t think that.
They left them with me.

32:25.600 --> 32:28.480
Many of them are alone, sick, elderly.
Anything can happen.

32:28.560 --> 32:30.360
Do they always hang here?

32:30.440 --> 32:31.720
Of course.

32:33.160 --> 32:34.240
Uh-huh.

32:35.440 --> 32:36.480
Grach.

32:36.640 --> 32:39.200
V.S. GRACH

32:40.400 --> 32:42.400
MUNICIPAL CLINICAL HOSPITAL

32:42.480 --> 32:45.640
And when he goes on leave,
all the grannies cry.

32:45.720 --> 32:47.680
No way.

32:47.760 --> 32:50.600
He’s attentive
and doesn’t sit around even for a minute.

32:50.680 --> 32:52.880
His heart is in this.
It’s not for the money.

32:52.960 --> 32:56.640
He makes time for the grannies
and he paints, yeah?

32:58.040 --> 32:59.920
-How’d you know?
-Right there.

33:00.000 --> 33:02.160
His signature.
It’s the same as on the prescription.

33:02.240 --> 33:03.400
GRACH

33:03.480 --> 33:04.480
Well, yeah.

33:04.560 --> 33:06.840
How could we get in touch
with this miracle doctor?

33:06.920 --> 33:09.960
We have one sick granny here who said,

33:10.040 --> 33:12.280
“I only want him to treat me.”

33:12.360 --> 33:15.960
Unfortunately today won’t work.
It’s his day off.

33:16.040 --> 33:17.960
He works one day, then has three days off.

33:18.040 --> 33:20.400
Miss,
how can we find out his home address?

33:21.320 --> 33:23.200
One minute. I’ll look.

33:28.040 --> 33:29.600
-Kargusheva, Number 9.
-Yes.

33:29.680 --> 33:32.280
-It’s close by.
-Five, seven minutes away.

33:32.360 --> 33:35.480
-Do you live far from here?
-Well, relatively.

33:36.520 --> 33:37.920
-Yes.
-A girl went missing.

33:40.880 --> 33:42.040
Thanks.

33:48.000 --> 33:50.000
POLICE

33:54.360 --> 33:55.960
AMBULANCE

33:56.040 --> 33:57.480
I hate you!

34:00.320 --> 34:01.960
What could happen to her?

34:02.760 --> 34:05.360
I hate you. I’ll kill you!

34:05.440 --> 34:09.800
She dressed her daughter, went downstairs
and left her by the entrance.

34:09.880 --> 34:12.000
Then she went for her son.
He’s two years old.

34:12.080 --> 34:14.440
She went up to the second floor.
She was gone for a minute.

34:14.520 --> 34:16.239
She came back downstairs.
Her daughter was gone.

34:16.320 --> 34:18.639
She went to the house,
and she wasn’t there.

34:18.719 --> 34:22.159
They searched the basements
of the houses nearby, and nothing.

34:23.040 --> 34:25.719
I gave an order and I’m thinking,
“God forbid they find”--

34:25.800 --> 34:27.719
They won’t find a body. -Why not?
-Because.

34:29.800 --> 34:31.280
Get away from her! Get away!

34:32.480 --> 34:34.360
Was there anything special
about your daughter?

34:34.440 --> 34:35.840
I don’t understand. What was wrong with her?

34:38.000 --> 34:41.960
She was feebleminded. She was slow.

34:42.040 --> 34:44.639
She’s five years old and can’t talk.

34:45.280 --> 34:46.440
Almost.

34:46.719 --> 34:47.880
Almost.

34:47.960 --> 34:50.120
He won’t kill her. You hear me?
He won’t kill her.

34:50.199 --> 34:52.040
-Why would--
-He won’t kill her!

34:52.120 --> 34:53.600
She hasn’t done anything wrong.

34:53.679 --> 34:56.159
She’s exactly who he’s been searching for
for so long.

34:56.239 --> 34:58.320
He found her. She put on the ring.

34:58.400 --> 34:59.360
Let’s go.

34:59.440 --> 35:01.040
Where did he come from?

35:05.960 --> 35:07.920
Let’s go. Take a little walk.

35:18.320 --> 35:20.440
-Listen--
-When I was young,

35:21.000 --> 35:22.800
I loved to swing.

35:24.240 --> 35:25.960
I was preparing to be an astronaut.

35:27.600 --> 35:30.600
I underestimated my own strength
and pushed off on this stupid thing.

35:31.680 --> 35:36.280
It gave me such a whack
on the back of my head.

35:37.520 --> 35:38.920
It was painful.

35:44.520 --> 35:46.120
That didn’t teach you anything?

35:49.120 --> 35:50.520
It’s like this, Rodion.

35:52.320 --> 35:55.040
You find him, and that’s it.

35:56.680 --> 35:59.080
Your mission ends with that.

36:07.920 --> 36:08.920
Or?

36:19.040 --> 36:21.040
Or you’ll get hit over the head.

36:36.920 --> 36:39.600
APARTMENT OF V. GRACH

36:41.720 --> 36:43.560
He doesn’t live here anymore.

36:44.800 --> 36:46.240
Why are you shaking so much?

37:35.920 --> 37:37.560
Have you recovered?

37:41.120 --> 37:42.120
Is this Vasya?

37:43.600 --> 37:45.880
He wasn’t like that when he was born.

37:50.880 --> 37:52.560
He was barely over four pounds.

37:55.160 --> 37:56.600
We couldn’t bathe him.

37:56.680 --> 37:58.560
His skin would turn dark in the water.

38:02.800 --> 38:05.360
Then he got better. He was two years old.

38:06.640 --> 38:08.640
He started waking up at night.

38:10.480 --> 38:12.240
He’d walk around the apartment.

38:16.480 --> 38:18.360
<i>The doctors said he was a sleepwalker.</i>

38:24.080 --> 38:26.360
<i>We had a record player in the room.</i>

38:27.520 --> 38:29.680
<i>I taught him how to put on records.</i>

38:31.120 --> 38:34.080
<i>He’d awaken and get up while we slept.</i>

38:36.560 --> 38:39.080
<i>Then it’d be… Magomaev.</i>

38:41.000 --> 38:43.080
<i>“Wedding, Wedding.”</i>

38:43.160 --> 38:46.960
<i>It’s a wedding, wedding, wedding</i>

38:47.040 --> 38:50.000
<i>Singing and dancing</i>

38:50.080 --> 38:54.280
<i>And wings carried the wedding far away</i>

38:56.120 --> 38:57.920
Ulya couldn’t stand it.

39:00.920 --> 39:03.360
She jumped out of bed
and started beating him about the head…

39:05.000 --> 39:05.800
with a slipper.

39:11.040 --> 39:12.520
She was screaming,

39:12.600 --> 39:15.040
“It’d be better if you were never born!”

39:15.120 --> 39:16.400
How much can you yell?

39:16.480 --> 39:18.720
-How much can you yell?
-What are you doing?

39:18.800 --> 39:20.720
I hate you!

39:23.800 --> 39:27.360
<i>The wedding was huge</i>
<i>Places were scarce</i>

39:27.440 --> 39:30.040
<i>And heaven and earth</i>
<i>Were scarcely large enough…</i>

39:30.640 --> 39:32.320
And after that, his eyesight.

39:33.400 --> 39:35.000
They prescribed glasses.

39:36.200 --> 39:40.760
Then, so he wouldn’t wake her at night,
I started using an alarm.

39:41.040 --> 39:43.960
I put it in the kitchen myself.

39:44.480 --> 39:46.400
At a quarter to 3:00, I’d get up…

39:48.160 --> 39:50.160
and wait for him to wake up.

39:50.240 --> 39:55.880
<i>A trio marched past me</i>
<i>Vibrant and colorful</i>

39:56.480 --> 40:01.760
<i>And the breath of spring came from them</i>

40:02.640 --> 40:07.840
<i>And I walked around completely alone</i>

40:08.600 --> 40:13.320
<i>And wished that I was the groom</i>

40:17.280 --> 40:19.600
We walked around until he came out of it.

40:21.600 --> 40:24.280
Then Ulya and I divorced.

40:24.800 --> 40:27.400
She left, and he stayed with my mom.

40:29.720 --> 40:33.480
Mama would draw him a bubble bath.

40:35.440 --> 40:37.440
He’d sit there for hours.

40:39.640 --> 40:41.720
After that, he slept well.

40:47.720 --> 40:50.360
The bath was his favorite place.

40:53.360 --> 40:57.080
Then he started going to kindergarten
till he moved back in with me.

40:58.440 --> 41:02.120
Why’d he move back
if everything was so great there?

41:05.040 --> 41:06.040
So…

41:06.960 --> 41:08.840
It’s a stupid story.

41:10.440 --> 41:13.880
There a was a little girl
at the kindergarten.

41:15.720 --> 41:21.360
She somehow climbed into his bed
during quiet time.

41:25.480 --> 41:27.640
She said,
“Let’s sleep like Mama and Papa.”

41:33.160 --> 41:34.360
They hugged…

41:36.680 --> 41:38.160
and fell asleep.

41:38.760 --> 41:39.960
They were just kids.

41:40.680 --> 41:44.160
The parents of the girl found out
and caused a big stink.

42:30.160 --> 42:31.680
But my mother…

42:32.800 --> 42:34.080
she’s old school.

42:38.040 --> 42:43.080
She said, “I’ll cut your wee-wee off
for this disgrace.”

42:45.720 --> 42:47.600
Well, Vaska ran away.

42:51.600 --> 42:53.600
He came here to me.

42:55.920 --> 42:58.000
He was only six, after all.

43:01.800 --> 43:05.760
He didn’t have any ill will for Mother.
He looked after her till she died.

43:06.880 --> 43:08.440
And how did she die?

43:08.520 --> 43:09.600
Yeah.

43:10.160 --> 43:11.800
She drowned in the tub-- her heart.

43:14.640 --> 43:16.000
Three years ago.

43:16.840 --> 43:18.640
Vaska would still see me.

43:19.720 --> 43:21.120
Then I got sick.

43:21.760 --> 43:23.120
I’d say…

43:24.280 --> 43:26.280
“Heal me. You’re a doctor.”

43:28.040 --> 43:29.840
He was sitting at the table there.

43:31.600 --> 43:33.200
He drank a glass of vodka…

43:35.280 --> 43:36.480
and fell over… and left.

43:45.400 --> 43:48.160
Now he only calls me on my birthday.

43:51.320 --> 43:52.520
And that’s it.

44:04.400 --> 44:05.560
I was with him…

44:07.960 --> 44:09.360
every night. Where does he live now?

44:12.920 --> 44:15.280
At Mother’s.
She signed over the apartment to him.

44:45.600 --> 44:46.760
What do you have there?

44:46.840 --> 44:49.440
The door is Chinese.
We can take it down in a second.

44:49.520 --> 44:51.680
Only he has one of our kids in there.

44:52.280 --> 44:53.120
Get out of here.

44:53.200 --> 44:55.320
What if he panics
and does something to her?

44:55.400 --> 44:57.240
He won’t do anything.

44:57.320 --> 44:59.920
He’s lived his whole life
in a state of panic. He’s used to it.

45:01.480 --> 45:03.480
-Why are you standing around? Get out.
-Where?

45:05.880 --> 45:07.480
Get the fuck out of here, quickly.

45:09.040 --> 45:11.640
If I wasn’t on the job, I’d--

45:11.720 --> 45:15.400
There’s a psycho behind that door
with a little girl and nothing to lose.

45:15.480 --> 45:17.440
Are you prepared to accept that guilt?

45:17.520 --> 45:19.320
-No.
-I am.

45:19.920 --> 45:21.960
-Go on, leave. Go.
-Downstairs!

45:22.440 --> 45:24.440
SPECIAL FORCES

45:27.800 --> 45:29.720
It seems I gave you the right address.

45:29.800 --> 45:31.480
You didn’t go quite far enough.

45:32.320 --> 45:33.120
Move out.

45:35.280 --> 45:38.200
Put away your gun. Put your gun away.

45:43.320 --> 45:45.000
Everyone’s gone, Vasily.

45:48.920 --> 45:51.080
Are we going to talk through the door?

45:53.480 --> 45:54.680
Come on.

45:56.360 --> 45:58.960
Did you think of the Thorazine in college?

46:00.080 --> 46:01.200
Smart.

46:02.240 --> 46:05.000
Then you perfected it on granny.

46:10.400 --> 46:11.560
Get out of here.

46:16.760 --> 46:19.160
I’m not judging you.
What am I, a judge or something?

46:21.640 --> 46:23.760
But then everyday life started, yeah?

46:24.880 --> 46:28.200
You went on calls with a medical bag.

46:29.600 --> 46:31.400
<i>You saw them and thought,</i>

46:32.080 --> 46:35.480
<i>“What saintly creatures</i>
<i>these grannies are.”</i>

46:36.640 --> 46:38.840
<i>They’re saints,</i>
<i>but devil knows how they manage.</i>

46:40.000 --> 46:41.800
<i>Basically, it’s not a life but torture.</i>

46:43.040 --> 46:46.800
<i>You freed them from their suffering</i>
<i>as much as you could, yeah?</i>

46:48.360 --> 46:49.680
“Do you want a shot, Granny?”

46:50.400 --> 46:52.720
“Oh, my dear, give me a shot,

46:53.600 --> 46:55.440
lest the pain torture me.

46:58.080 --> 47:00.000
<i>Thank you. May God keep you well.”</i>

47:01.080 --> 47:05.760
<i>“Now, Granny, we’re moving on…</i>
<i>to an aquatic procedure.”</i>

47:06.360 --> 47:08.120
Well, who’d bury them there?

47:08.200 --> 47:09.400
Drowned and drowned.

47:10.080 --> 47:12.200
<i>Heart, blood pressure-- whatever fits.</i>

47:14.160 --> 47:17.880
Grandmother died,
and now you can think about yourself.

47:19.040 --> 47:22.880
Did you start dreaming about her--
that girl from your childhood?

47:24.680 --> 47:26.440
<i>You thought, “If only I could find her.</i>

47:27.680 --> 47:29.680
I’d give everything in the world
to find her.”

47:29.760 --> 47:31.600
You even drove to the playground.

47:31.680 --> 47:33.280
Time after time. I know.

47:33.840 --> 47:35.320
Only you didn’t find her.

47:38.520 --> 47:40.320
You started looking on the streets.

47:40.800 --> 47:43.080
And I can’t forgive you for that, Vasya.

48:08.920 --> 48:10.280
<i>You’re a doctor, Vas.</i>

48:11.040 --> 48:13.520
<i>You understand what hurts.</i>

48:13.600 --> 48:16.200
You started injecting Thorazine.
It helped for a while, right?

48:16.960 --> 48:18.880
Then you thought,
“Why is it that I’m sick?

48:18.960 --> 48:21.240
It’s everyone else who’s sick.”

48:21.320 --> 48:22.840
I understand, Vas.

48:22.920 --> 48:25.920
I’ve had these thoughts myself,
but not about children!

48:26.560 --> 48:28.280
They haven’t had a chance to--

48:28.720 --> 48:30.280
And you killed them in the basement.

48:30.360 --> 48:31.960
You can’t do that. Do you understand?

48:38.240 --> 48:42.680
I can’t forgive you, but I can promise,
if you release her, I’ll help you.

48:51.240 --> 48:53.160
Remember how it was when you were a child?

48:56.040 --> 48:57.440
A bubble bath.

48:59.480 --> 49:01.280
Everything was ahead of you.

49:02.280 --> 49:03.880
Everything was ahead of you.

49:52.280 --> 49:57.880
<i>But this is a</i>

49:57.960 --> 50:02.440
<i>Wedding, wedding, wedding</i>

50:02.520 --> 50:06.520
<i>Singing and dancing</i>

50:07.120 --> 50:11.480
<i>And wings carried the wedding far away</i>

50:11.560 --> 50:14.920
<i>The wedding was huge</i>
<i>Places were scarce</i>

50:15.000 --> 50:18.080
<i>And heaven and earth</i>
<i>Were scarcely large enough</i>

50:18.160 --> 50:21.200
<i>The wedding was huge</i>
<i>Places were scarce</i> <i>And heaven and earth</i>
<i>Were scarcely large enough</i>

50:29.920 --> 50:32.720
<i>The wedding was huge</i>
<i>Places were scarce</i>

50:33.560 --> 50:38.000
<i>And heaven and earth were scarcely</i>

50:38.080 --> 50:42.360
<i>Large enough</i>

50:48.520 --> 50:49.760
Let’s clear this up.

50:50.480 --> 50:52.920
Meglin intended to kill Grach,

50:53.000 --> 50:56.360
thus violating all instructions
in our protocol, and presented that to the psycho
as an act of kindness?

51:00.560 --> 51:02.320
Correct.

51:03.200 --> 51:04.840
And you justify that? I’ll rephrase my question.

51:07.880 --> 51:09.960
You would’ve done the same?

51:13.160 --> 51:14.800
Yes, of course.

51:29.280 --> 51:33.720
SERPUKHOV

51:44.040 --> 51:47.440
-Here. Let me help you.
-Oh, hi. Thank you.

51:53.920 --> 51:55.120
Thank you.

52:13.720 --> 52:15.360
Help!

52:20.840 --> 52:22.720
Help!

52:23.280 --> 52:24.720
People!
