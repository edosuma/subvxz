00:10.333 --> 00:12.083
- Aw, look at you kids.

00:12.125 --> 00:13.500
I can't believe

00:12.125 --> 00:13.500
you've been the face

00:13.542 --> 00:16.333
of Honest Abe's Tires

00:13.542 --> 00:16.333
for 12 years.

00:16.375 --> 00:19.834
Oh, you're growing up so fast.

00:19.875 --> 00:22.375
- She knows the beards

00:19.875 --> 00:22.375
are fake, right?

00:22.417 --> 00:24.417
- I just love when we shoot

00:22.417 --> 00:24.417
this commercial.

00:24.458 --> 00:26.083
all: Us too.

00:26.125 --> 00:27.875
- I hate it when we shoot

00:26.125 --> 00:27.875
this commercial.

00:27.917 --> 00:30.500
- My beard is itchy.

00:27.917 --> 00:30.500
- I'm a girl.

00:27.917 --> 00:30.500
I don't even get

00:30.542 --> 00:31.709
why I have a beard.

00:31.750 --> 00:33.125
- I don't get why we keep doing

00:33.166 --> 00:34.542
this dumb commercial.

00:34.583 --> 00:37.250
- Because Mom loves it,

00:34.583 --> 00:37.250
and Dad gets free tires.

00:37.291 --> 00:40.000
- But what's the connection

00:37.291 --> 00:40.000
between us and tires?

00:40.041 --> 00:41.750
- It's because...

00:41.792 --> 00:43.625
"We're the Harper Quadruplets.

00:43.667 --> 00:45.125
"And like the four of us,

00:45.166 --> 00:48.041
the tires of a car

00:45.166 --> 00:48.041

00:48.083 --> 00:52.500
all:

00:48.083 --> 00:52.500
"And work in perfect harmony."

00:52.542 --> 00:54.625
- It's the same lame script

00:52.542 --> 00:54.625
every year.

00:54.667 --> 00:57.458
- Have you guys seen

00:54.667 --> 00:57.458
this year's script? It's genius!

00:57.500 --> 00:59.125
You've done it again,

00:57.500 --> 00:59.125
Honest Abe.

00:59.166 --> 01:01.417
- These quads are the best thing

00:59.166 --> 01:01.417
that have ever happened

01:01.458 --> 01:02.834
to my tire business.

01:01.458 --> 01:02.834
- Aww.

01:02.875 --> 01:05.083
- I feel like

01:02.875 --> 01:05.083
we've become family.

01:05.125 --> 01:06.667
Nice to see you again,

01:05.125 --> 01:06.667
Girl Quad,

01:06.709 --> 01:10.417
Short Quad, Cute Quad,

01:06.709 --> 01:10.417
and You Quad.

01:10.458 --> 01:13.083
- Well, Mom and Dad Quad

01:10.458 --> 01:13.083
are gonna browse the tires.

01:13.125 --> 01:14.625
- Anything you want,

01:13.125 --> 01:14.625
and grab yourself

01:14.667 --> 01:16.083
an Honest Abe air freshener.

01:16.125 --> 01:17.333
Here, kids.

01:17.375 --> 01:18.959
You can have some too.

01:19.000 --> 01:20.834
The scent is in the beard.

01:22.208 --> 01:24.125
- Ah, I got ocean breeze.

01:24.166 --> 01:25.667
- Ah, I got icy mint.

01:25.709 --> 01:26.750
- I got autumn leaves.

01:26.792 --> 01:28.709
- I got middle-aged beard.

01:30.208 --> 01:31.834
- It's good to be a quad,

01:30.208 --> 01:31.834
isn't it?

01:33.291 --> 01:34.750
- Is it?

01:34.792 --> 01:37.792
Is this what being a quad

01:34.792 --> 01:37.792
has come to?

01:37.834 --> 01:40.875
Sniffing beards and being

01:37.834 --> 01:40.875
called "Girl Quad"?

01:40.917 --> 01:42.792
- It's better than "Short Quad."

01:42.834 --> 01:44.417
- I'm just "You Quad."

01:44.458 --> 01:46.500
- "Cute Quad" isn't so bad,

01:46.542 --> 01:49.250
but I'm offended for you guys.

01:49.291 --> 01:51.250
- The point is, he doesn't

01:49.291 --> 01:51.250
even know our names.

01:51.291 --> 01:53.291
He's just using us

01:51.291 --> 01:53.291
because we're quads.

01:53.333 --> 01:56.333
- Yeah, like we're some sort

01:53.333 --> 01:56.333
of freak show.

01:56.375 --> 01:58.458
Uh, Dawn,

01:56.375 --> 01:58.458
your lady beard's crooked.

01:58.500 --> 02:00.166
- Oh, thank you.

02:00.208 --> 02:01.959
Wait, what am I doing?

02:02.000 --> 02:04.458
Look, I am sick of doing

02:02.000 --> 02:04.458
this same commercial

02:04.500 --> 02:05.500
every year.

02:05.542 --> 02:06.583
- Yeah.

02:05.542 --> 02:06.583
- Me too.

02:06.625 --> 02:08.000
- I'm over it.

02:08.041 --> 02:09.458
- What's the matter, quads?

02:09.500 --> 02:11.375
- You know, we're not

02:09.500 --> 02:11.375
just quads.

02:11.417 --> 02:12.834
We have names.

02:12.875 --> 02:14.792
I'm Dawn.

02:12.875 --> 02:14.792
That's Nicky.

02:14.834 --> 02:18.125
That's Ricky; that's--

02:14.834 --> 02:18.125
- I'm good with Cute Quad.

02:18.166 --> 02:19.834
- Admit it.

02:18.166 --> 02:19.834
You're only using us

02:19.875 --> 02:21.333
because we're quads.

02:21.375 --> 02:22.333
- [laughing]

02:22.375 --> 02:24.750
Of course I am.

02:24.792 --> 02:26.625
- We're not even getting

02:24.792 --> 02:26.625
anything out of it.

02:26.667 --> 02:28.291
I mean, our dad gets tires,

02:28.333 --> 02:29.834
but what about us?

02:29.875 --> 02:33.375
- Yeah, it's not like we get

02:29.875 --> 02:33.375
to get cool outfits

02:33.417 --> 02:35.750
or go on tour as spokespeople.

02:35.792 --> 02:37.917
- Yeah, or get a limo

02:37.959 --> 02:39.750
with an ice-cream sundae bar.

02:39.792 --> 02:41.834
- Well, that's just crazy talk.

02:41.875 --> 02:43.375
Is this about

02:41.875 --> 02:43.375
the air fresheners?

02:43.417 --> 02:45.250
You Quad, swap with Girl Quad.

02:45.291 --> 02:47.625
- This is not about

02:45.291 --> 02:47.625
the air fresheners.

02:47.667 --> 02:50.125
This is about being more

02:47.667 --> 02:50.125
than just quads.

02:50.166 --> 02:51.667
- But you're

02:50.166 --> 02:51.667
the most famous quads

02:51.709 --> 02:52.709
in all of Boulder

02:52.750 --> 02:54.583

02:58.375 --> 02:59.875

02:59.917 --> 03:02.458
Our days as the Harper Quads...

03:02.500 --> 03:03.792
are over.

03:03.834 --> 03:05.917

- We're re-tire-ing.

03:09.291 --> 03:11.875

- Wait a minute.

03:13.959 --> 03:15.625
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

03:16.625 --> 03:17.917

03:19.750 --> 03:22.125
- We don't want to be

03:19.750 --> 03:22.125

03:22.166 --> 03:23.500
- Fine.

No commercial,

03:30.959 --> 03:32.834
- No tires!

03:30.959 --> 03:32.834
- Aww.

03:32.875 --> 03:34.500

03:32.875 --> 03:34.500
don't want to do it,

03:34.542 --> 03:35.500
they don't have to do it.

03:35.542 --> 03:36.625
- Honey, he already took

03:36.667 --> 03:38.625
last year's tires off our car.

03:38.667 --> 03:40.166
- Parenting, Tom.

03:40.208 --> 03:42.792
Hey, I am proud of you

03:40.208 --> 03:42.792

03:42.834 --> 03:43.834
all: Thanks, Mom.

03:43.875 --> 03:44.917

03:44.959 --> 03:46.208

03:46.250 --> 03:48.625
- It is Louis.

03:48.667 --> 03:51.041

The Harper family...

and we found out which one

20:59.542 --> 21:02.709
of you isn't related.

21:07.208 --> 21:08.166
- You know what?

21:08.208 --> 21:09.709
It doesn't matter anymore.

21:09.750 --> 21:11.458
- We don't want to know.

21:11.500 --> 21:16.417
- Because no matter what

21:11.500 --> 21:16.417
that stupid DNA test says...

21:16.458 --> 21:18.291
we are family.

21:18.333 --> 21:19.667
- Absolutely.

21:19.709 --> 21:22.291
But just out of curiosity.

21:22.333 --> 21:24.583
- It's the one

21:22.333 --> 21:24.583
who's part terrier.

21:24.625 --> 21:25.625
- Wait, what?

21:24.625 --> 21:25.625
- Huh?

21:25.667 --> 21:27.917
- One of us is a dog?

21:27.959 --> 21:29.750
- Well, I guess that explains

21:29.792 --> 21:32.208
my adorable puppy-dog eyes.

21:32.250 --> 21:34.667
- No, Dicky,

21:32.250 --> 21:34.667
you're not part dog.

21:34.709 --> 21:37.834
One of the samples

21:34.709 --> 21:37.834
must have been contaminated.

21:37.875 --> 21:40.208
- By Squishy!

21:40.250 --> 21:42.583
- He's been chewing

21:40.250 --> 21:42.583
on everything lately.

21:42.625 --> 21:45.291
- [barking]

21:47.625 --> 21:51.000
- See, you are all related,

21:47.625 --> 21:51.000
just like we said.

21:52.959 --> 21:54.583
- This is a real sweet

21:52.959 --> 21:54.583
family moment,

21:54.625 --> 21:55.834
but I got to be honest.

21:55.875 --> 21:56.917
You four are out.

21:56.959 --> 21:58.542
I'm going a whole new way.

21:58.583 --> 21:59.917
Whoo!
