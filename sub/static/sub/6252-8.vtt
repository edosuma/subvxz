of ignition?
There is none.

02:02.415 --> 02:06.954
Well, as an arson investigator,
you should know that every fire
has a point of ignition.

02:07.044 --> 02:08.705
Not if it was hit
by an asteroid.

Even an asteroid
with a diameter
as small as five meters...

02:12.216 --> 02:14.172

02:16.929 --> 02:18.794
- Is she serious?
- Always.

The whole asteroid thing
was a joke.

02:21.559 --> 02:23.470
- Oh!
- [Chuckles]

02:23.561 --> 02:27.395

it’s such an absurd theory.

Do you get it?

02:58.721 --> 03:00.336
It’s not retardant.

03:00.431 --> 03:03.389
By the time
the firefighters arrived on scene,
the blaze had burned itself out.

03:03.476 --> 03:05.933

Wow. This is a first.
Melted bones.

03:12.276 --> 03:14.938
No. Not possible.
Bones don’t melt.

03:15.029 --> 03:17.020
You know, usually I defer
all things bones to you,

03:17.114 --> 03:19.105
but, you know,
I’ve cooked with
a lot of cheese.

03:19.200 --> 03:20.781
That is melted.

03:29.126 --> 03:31.037
Whoa!
Look at that.

03:31.128 --> 03:33.210
You’re excited about
the decedent, Dr. Hodgins?

03:33.297 --> 03:36.881
Sure. They said
the dude melted
into the truck.

03:36.967 --> 03:39.458
Uh, at this point,
we haven’t been able
to determine gender.

03:39.553 --> 03:41.965
And bones don’t melt,
Dr. Hodgins.

03:42.056 --> 03:45.548
The melting process
represents a change of state
from a solid to a liquid.

03:45.643 --> 03:47.099
An impossibility with bones.

03:47.186 --> 03:50.223
I know. But they sure
appear to be melted.

03:50.314 --> 03:53.181
But how?
I haven’t seen a fire
hot enough to do this.

03:53.275 --> 03:56.483
Found at the scene.
A light dusting
over most of the wreckage.

03:56.570 --> 03:58.071
It could give us
cause of death.

03:58.155 --> 04:00.737
I think I found that.

Oh.

- [ Hodgins] Bullet.

died in a fire.

- And melted.

any other word for it.

[Whooshing ]

04:54.712 --> 04:56.202

04:56.297 --> 04:58.629
It was my idea to remove the bones
with liquid nitrogen.

04:58.716 --> 05:01.082
And the FBI. is giving me
the psych evaluation...

05:01.177 --> 05:03.634
so I can get security clearance
to work unsupervised.

05:03.721 --> 05:05.461
But you don’t have
that clearance yet,

05:05.556 --> 05:07.217

equipment...

05:07.308 --> 05:08.889

You just think it’s cool.

05:11.479 --> 05:13.015
Maybe.

05:14.190 --> 05:16.932
Careful not to saturate
any particular section.

05:17.026 --> 05:19.483
Too much nitric oxide can
cause the bones to fracture.

05:19.570 --> 05:21.026
I know, Ms. Wick.

05:21.113 --> 05:23.354
Is the psych evaluation
intimidating?

05:23.449 --> 05:25.440
I mean, was it difficult
for you to pass it?

05:25.534 --> 05:28.651
Perhaps you could focus
on how we’re going to
identify the victim.

05:28.746 --> 05:31.704
There’s no flesh,
so that rules out fingerprints.

05:31.790 --> 05:34.327
And since
the skull appears melted,

05:34.418 --> 05:37.751
we can discount
facial reconstruction
and dental comparisons.

05:37.838 --> 05:39.920
Maybe I could think
a little clearer...

05:40.007 --> 05:42.498
if I was using the equipment.

And he looks at me.
He goes, “Daddy, I hate
your new girlfriend.”

07:04.967 --> 07:07.128
Did you ask him why?
No, I didn’t.
It was awkward.

07:07.219 --> 07:08.834
He went back
to watching cartoons.

07:08.929 --> 07:10.635
The point is, they have
to meet sometime, right?

- Right. Because

- Bones don’t melt.

08:07.821 --> 08:11.313
Exactly. But magnesium
burns hot and fast.

08:11.408 --> 08:14.070
If the bones were exposed
to a magnesium fire...

08:14.161 --> 08:16.698

15 and 45 minutes...

of 500 degrees Celsius—

08:19.249 --> 08:21.865
The biogenic composition and
structure of the bone mineral...

08:21.960 --> 08:23.461
would have crystallized...

08:23.545 --> 08:25.672
and the bones would appear
as if they had melted.

08:25.798 --> 08:27.334
Yes.

08:27.424 --> 08:29.335
Although I thought of it first,

08:29.426 --> 08:31.883
if anyone from the FBI.
should ask.

08:31.970 --> 08:33.301
Really?

08:33.389 --> 08:35.675
But for magnesium to ignite,
it needs to be wet first.

So, last night,
when the mass spec
identified magnesium,

08:39.978 --> 08:42.310

11:04.665 --> 11:06.906
The bullet was not
cause of death.

11:07.000 --> 11:08.615
Your evidence, Ms. Wick?

11:08.710 --> 11:10.837
Well, on the X-ray,

11:10.921 --> 11:14.459
it appeared the bullet
was embedded quite deeply
into the sternum.

11:14.550 --> 11:17.041
But after my
excellent observation...

11:17.135 --> 11:19.717
that magnesium caused the bones
to crystallize...

11:19.805 --> 11:21.545
and thus only
appear to be melted,

11:21.640 --> 11:24.177
l reexamined
the point of entry.

11:24.268 --> 11:26.884
The bullet only penetrated
a few millimeters.

11:26.979 --> 11:29.846
Not enough to cause death
or even incapacitation.

11:29.982 --> 11:34.646
So the bone warped
around the bullet because of
the extreme heat of the magnesium fire.

11:34.778 --> 11:36.860
Very good.
I know.

11:36.947 --> 11:40.940
You’ll put in a good word for me
with the F.B.l., won’t you?
For my clearance?

11:41.034 --> 11:44.526
It’s a psych evaluation.
l’m of no value
when it comes to that.

11:44.621 --> 11:47.237
That’s true.

11:47.332 --> 11:50.324
So, if the bullet
didn’t kill him,
how did it get there?

11:50.419 --> 11:52.876
Perhaps it was shot
from a great distance...

11:52.963 --> 11:55.454
so the impact wasn’t
sufficient to be fatal.

11:55.549 --> 11:58.416
Booth talked to
the owner of the truck—
Jesse Wilson.

11:58.510 --> 12:01.843
Wilson |.D.’d the victim
as George Lyford.

12:01.930 --> 12:04.421
We’ll get Lyford’s
medical records and confirm.

12:04.516 --> 12:07.679
Wilson claims the victim
had been fighting with his wife
about money.

12:07.769 --> 12:10.932
One week ago, the wife
took out an insurance policy
on George’s life.

12:11.023 --> 12:14.936
Oh, my God.
The wife totally torched him.

12:16.486 --> 12:20.479
l was just trying
to go with my gut.
It’s an FBI. thing.

12:31.668 --> 12:34.250
She has detention duty
for another hour or so.

12:34.338 --> 12:38.001
l was once placed in detention
for calling my science teacher
a fool.

12:38.091 --> 12:41.379
- You can’t do that, Bones.
- Booth, he was trying to teach
quantum mechanics...

12:41.470 --> 12:44.303
without even
a rudimentary understanding
of Planck’s constant.

12:44.389 --> 12:45.970
What would you have called him?

12:46.058 --> 12:49.300
You have every right.
I didn’t know the details.
I’m sorry.

12:49.394 --> 12:53.512
F.B.l. I need to talk to you
for one second.

12:54.775 --> 12:57.187
Oh! Do you see that kid
right there in the red hat?

12:57.277 --> 13:01.520
I saw him at the chopper shop.
When I talk to Kathy out here,
you go in there and talk to him.

13:01.615 --> 13:05.153
No. Teenagers are dull-witted
and very difficult to talk to.

13:05.243 --> 13:06.858
Sorry, Bones,
but you’re all I got.

13:06.954 --> 13:10.196
Okay. I can’t go in there
and question him. I’d need
a parent or an advocate.

13:10.290 --> 13:14.078
But you’re not law enforcement,
so you can ask him anything
that you want.

13:14.211 --> 13:15.917
Can I help you guys?
Yeah, F.B.l.

13:16.004 --> 13:19.417
We just have to
ask you a few questions
if you don’t mind.

13:19.508 --> 13:20.964
Of course.

13:21.051 --> 13:22.791
Okay.

13:29.434 --> 13:30.935
- You the sub?
- No.

13:31.019 --> 13:33.226
I’m a forensic anthropologist.

13:33.313 --> 13:38.979
And, for the record, I’m totally
against detention as a form
ofjuvenile punishment.

13:39.069 --> 13:41.606
Yeah. If I wanna smoke,
it’s none of Big Brother’s business.

13:41.697 --> 13:43.779
Oh, your big brother
attends this school?

13:43.865 --> 13:48.154
I’m talking about the teachers.
We have rights. I take
American History, so I know.

13:48.245 --> 13:50.531
They try to control
everything we do.

13:50.622 --> 13:52.328
You know, like we’re
still kids or something.

13:52.416 --> 13:56.455
You are certainly not kids.
You’ve probably been
menstruating for several years.

13:56.545 --> 14:01.505
In many primitive cultures,
you’d be responsible for
children of your own by now.

14:01.591 --> 14:03.718
Hmm. You’re cool.

14:03.802 --> 14:06.544
- Uh, I am?
- Yeah. Maybe you can help
get me out of here.

14:06.638 --> 14:08.629
I don’t know why I’m here
in the first place.

14:08.724 --> 14:11.636
- You cheated on the chem test.
- I’m from a broken home.

14:11.727 --> 14:13.217
That’s gotta count
for something.

14:13.311 --> 14:16.678
- Well, what about you, sir?
Why are you here?
- [ Scoffs ]

14:16.773 --> 14:21.142
- Randy doesn’t talk much.
- The dude downloaded porn
on the library computer.

14:21.236 --> 14:23.192
You’re a little horn dog,
aren’t you?

14:23.280 --> 14:26.113
You know, I have a better way
to make you unzip your pants.

14:26.241 --> 14:27.947
[ Laughing ]
Damn it, Amber!

14:28.035 --> 14:30.276
[ Brennan ]
As adolescents,
your decision-making process...

14:30.370 --> 14:33.032
is compromised
by hormonal changes.

14:33.123 --> 14:35.830
You can hardly be held
accountable for your behavior.

14:36.918 --> 14:40.456
You work repairing
motorcycles, don’t you?

14:46.386 --> 14:48.342
Told you
he didn’t like to talk.

14:48.430 --> 14:49.840
[ Door Closes ]

14:49.973 --> 14:52.385
Are you sure it’s George?
Yeah, I’m sure.

14:52.476 --> 14:55.013
[ Sniffles ]
All right.
Okay. I gotta go.

14:55.103 --> 14:56.889
l— I should
call his parents.

14:56.980 --> 14:59.141
Kathy, uh, last week,

14:59.232 --> 15:01.974
you took out a real expensive
life insurance policy
on your husband.

15:02.069 --> 15:03.605
So?

15:03.695 --> 15:06.687
I think you know
what I’m suggesting here.

15:06.782 --> 15:10.400
Wait. That— That—
That policy
was George’s idea.

15:10.494 --> 15:12.234
Okay, we’ve been
trying to have a baby,

15:12.329 --> 15:15.287
and, if something happened
to him, he wanted to make sure
that we were okay.

15:15.373 --> 15:17.705
Your husband didn’t
come home last night.
You don’t find that odd?

15:17.793 --> 15:20.751
l was on a field trip with
my students in Mount Vernon.

15:20.837 --> 15:22.828
l-l-l wasn’t even gonna
see him until tonight.

15:22.923 --> 15:24.709
| see.

15:25.801 --> 15:27.917
I had no reason
to believe he was missing.

15:28.011 --> 15:31.174
Okay, I love my husband.
I will— I will do anything
to help your investigation.

15:31.264 --> 15:34.176
Good. I’d like you
to come along with me
for further questioning.

15:35.310 --> 15:37.426
Fine.

15:37.521 --> 15:40.183
l extracted the bullet
from the victim’s sternum.

15:40.315 --> 15:42.601
I assumed he was shot.
Logical assumption.

15:42.692 --> 15:45.069
But there are
no striations on it.

15:45.153 --> 15:47.109
Which means
it wasn’t fired from a gun.

15:47.197 --> 15:50.234
So how would it have wound up
embedded in his chest?

15:50.325 --> 15:52.156
Are you suggesting
| conduct an experiment?

15:52.244 --> 15:54.326
My idea. So you have
to let me help, right?

15:55.956 --> 15:57.036
Your Highness?

16:01.795 --> 16:03.285
Hey.

16:04.381 --> 16:06.497
I hope the frame’s okay.

16:06.591 --> 16:08.092
Look at that.
That’s great.

16:08.176 --> 16:09.882
You two look so much alike.

16:09.970 --> 16:11.835
And the world
is better for it.

16:11.930 --> 16:14.137
Hannah, I want you to meet him.

16:14.224 --> 16:15.680
- You sure?
- You don’t wanna meet him?

16:15.767 --> 16:17.303
Of course.

16:17.435 --> 16:18.595
But—
What?

16:20.021 --> 16:24.230
When I told you
I wasn’t very good
with kids, that’s true.

16:25.777 --> 16:28.234
I don’t want to mess anything up
between you and your son.

16:28.321 --> 16:30.983
Look, I love you, all right?
He’s gonna love you too.

16:31.074 --> 16:34.817
And don’t think of him as a kid.
Just think of him
as a short guy who—

16:34.911 --> 16:36.447
who’s not allowed to drink.

16:36.538 --> 16:40.531
- What if he hates me?
- Mmm, that’s impossible.

16:43.461 --> 16:47.670
[Sighs] Look,
I already told that Booth guy
that George and l were in debt.

16:47.757 --> 16:49.748
Why do I have to keep
going through this?

16:49.843 --> 16:52.585
Well, the F.B.l. feels
that I could provide
a different perspective.

16:52.679 --> 16:55.967
You’re a shrink.
You guys make things up.

16:59.186 --> 17:02.974
I know, but cooperating
would certainly help
your situation.

17:03.064 --> 17:06.477
30, you and your husband—
Y-you fought over money?

17:07.944 --> 17:09.650
[ Chuckles ]
Like any couple, sure.

17:09.738 --> 17:13.481
These are, uh,
credit card statements
from the past year.

17:13.575 --> 17:16.817
| see you liked
buying things
off infomercials.

17:16.912 --> 17:20.370
Well, you can get
good deals on TV
because they buy in bulk.

17:20.457 --> 17:22.163
Gotcha.

17:22.250 --> 17:24.866
You also like
online auctions.

17:24.961 --> 17:28.670
Oh. I see you bought
Star Wars trading cards.

17:28.757 --> 17:32.124
Yeah.
Growing up, me and my brothers
were all fans of the Force.

17:32.219 --> 17:35.586
I understand.
I’m a Star Warrior myself.

17:35.680 --> 17:37.261
[Clears Throat]

17:37.349 --> 17:40.933
“Don’t you call me
a mindless philosopher,
you ovenNeight glob of grease.”

17:42.103 --> 17:44.936
- Excuse me?
- C-3PO.
Sounded just like him.

17:45.023 --> 17:48.186
From Star Wars?
It’s, like, the most
quoted line in the movie.

17:48.276 --> 17:50.653
Yeah. Of course.

17:53.490 --> 17:56.482
Can you explain to me
why you spent $500...

17:56.576 --> 17:58.817
on a Jedi Knight trading card
with a red border...

17:58.912 --> 18:00.948
when its value
is less than a dollar?

18:01.039 --> 18:03.576
I don’t know.
I guess I made a mistake.

18:03.667 --> 18:06.409
What about the, uh,
Clone Wars card
you bought last month?

18:06.503 --> 18:11.839
Again, you spent $500,
but you could probably find it
right now online for 50 cents.

18:13.510 --> 18:15.842
Look, when | get stressed,
lshop.

18:15.929 --> 18:18.045
You don’t have to make it
into a big deal.

18:18.139 --> 18:21.006
I’m not making this
into anything it’s not.

18:21.101 --> 18:22.637
I assure you.

18:24.145 --> 18:25.885
Okay.

18:28.316 --> 18:30.181
[ Booth ]
So, Hannah’s gonna
meet Parker tomorrow.

18:30.318 --> 18:33.060
You don’t sound happy
about that.
No, I am. It’s gonna be great.

18:33.154 --> 18:35.531
It’s gonna be really good.
ljust— I’m a little worried.
Yeah.

18:35.615 --> 18:37.992
Because your loyalty
lies with Parker.

18:38.076 --> 18:41.568
And if he doesn’t
accept Hannah, you may
lose the woman you love.

18:41.663 --> 18:43.745
- It’s not that simple, Bones.
- I suppose not.

18:43.832 --> 18:46.323
You could send him off
to boarding school.

18:46.418 --> 18:48.249
That’s what the English
have done for many generations.

18:48.336 --> 18:51.043
- I’m not sending him
to boarding school.
- Then I wouldn’t worry.

18:51.172 --> 18:52.628
No?
It won’t do you
any good.

18:52.716 --> 18:55.173
If your relationship
falls apart, worrying
won’t salvage it.

18:55.302 --> 18:57.008
Oh, thanks, Bones.
Of course.

19:00.390 --> 19:03.553
So? I had an aunt
who spent every last dime
on old-fashioned cookie jars.

19:03.643 --> 19:05.258
What’s this have to do
with our case?

19:05.353 --> 19:08.311
There are hundreds
of online merchants that sell
Star Wars trading cards.

19:08.398 --> 19:11.811
Kathy bought all of her cards
from the same person
at grossly inflated prices.

19:11.943 --> 19:15.106
So you’re thinking that
she was somehow laundering money
through that online merchant?

19:15.196 --> 19:18.438
So she was paying
inflated prices for relatively
worthless merchandise.

19:18.533 --> 19:20.148
Yeah, that’s exactly
what I’m thinking.

19:20.243 --> 19:24.452
Kathy bought all of her cards
from a seller named,
uh, Vader649.

19:24.539 --> 19:27.326
I’ll tell you what.
I’ll get a subpoena for
the identity of this Vader649.

19:27.417 --> 19:29.123
Good work, Sweets.

19:29.210 --> 19:31.075
Yeah, it was, wasn’t it?

19:31.171 --> 19:33.708
Job well done.

19:33.798 --> 19:35.413
Well, you know.

19:38.428 --> 19:41.010
Nine-millimeter bullet
is on the magnesium.

19:41.097 --> 19:43.839
Now we could see if the fire
would be enough to set it off.

19:43.933 --> 19:46.515
Proving that
he was shot by ammunition
that was stored in the car.

19:46.603 --> 19:48.514
Yeah, which would explain
the lack of striations.

19:48.605 --> 19:50.095
A simple yet elegant thesis.

19:50.190 --> 19:53.774
Now, the mist
simulates a light rain.

19:53.860 --> 19:56.192
Because water is needed
to ignite the magnesium.

19:56.279 --> 20:00.898
And although the magnesium
can be ignited by heat
from the rising sun,

20:00.992 --> 20:02.948
I’ll use these burners
to save us some time.

20:03.036 --> 20:06.324
Here. Given the fluorescence
spectrometry of magnesium,
you’re gonna need those.

20:06.414 --> 20:07.699
All right.

20:07.791 --> 20:09.406
Any second now.

20:09.501 --> 20:11.787
[ Daisy]
Let’s crank these suckers up.

20:17.509 --> 20:18.999
[ Explodes ]
Ow!

20:19.094 --> 20:21.380
Oh! Oh, are you okay?
[ Groans ]

20:21.513 --> 20:23.754
You shot me!
Well, technically, no.

20:23.848 --> 20:25.759
The bullet
is in the backstop.

20:25.850 --> 20:27.465
You were struck by
the bullet casing,

20:27.560 --> 20:30.472
because we failed to account for
Newton’s third law of motion.

20:30.563 --> 20:32.144
For every action, there’s—

20:32.232 --> 20:34.223
An equal and opposite
reaction. I know.

20:34.317 --> 20:36.524
Now can you please
go get me a first aid kit?

20:36.611 --> 20:38.522
Oh, yes! Of course.

20:40.573 --> 20:43.110
Dr. Hodgins, our experiment
was a success, wasn’t it?

20:43.201 --> 20:44.657
Ow! Go!

20:46.413 --> 20:48.825
[Sighs]

20:53.002 --> 20:54.913
Paul, we know
that you’re Vader649.

20:55.004 --> 20:57.256
So? Is there a law against
using that screen name?

20:57.340 --> 21:01.379
I’m actually more interested
in the fact that you were
suspended for fighting, bullying.

21:01.469 --> 21:04.051
As his advocate,
l have to object, Dr. Sweets.

21:04.139 --> 21:07.723
Okay. I assure you
that I am as concerned
with Paul’s welfare as you are.

21:07.809 --> 21:09.424
If he’s in trouble,
he needs help.

21:09.519 --> 21:11.134
I didn’t do anything wrong.

21:11.229 --> 21:13.971
You’ve been
selling Star Wars cards
to your teacher, haven’t you?

21:14.065 --> 21:16.477
Yeah.
Capitalism is king, right?

21:16.568 --> 21:19.230
Well, she’s been paying you
a lot more than they were worth.

21:19.320 --> 21:20.856
A lot more.

21:22.198 --> 21:24.905
Over $3,000
on worthless cards.

21:24.993 --> 21:27.905
Miss Lyford was paying you
for something else, wasn’t she?

21:27.996 --> 21:31.989
-Don’t answer that.
-If he can offer an explanation,
it could help him.

21:32.083 --> 21:33.823
’Cause right now,
the F.B.l. thinks...

21:33.918 --> 21:37.001
that Miss Lyford paid you
to kill her husband.

21:37.088 --> 21:38.874
Paul, not another word.

21:49.267 --> 21:53.431
You were paying Paul Linoto
$500 a month for worthless
trading cards.

21:53.521 --> 21:55.307
I don’t want to
make this more than it is,

21:55.398 --> 21:57.810
but it looks pretty bad
without any help from me.

21:57.901 --> 22:01.314
Okay, look. I admit that
l was paying him for something.

22:01.404 --> 22:04.316
I couldn’t afford the cash,
and it was a way to charge it.

22:04.407 --> 22:08.992
The F.B.l. thinks that you
were charging $500 a month
on your credit card...

22:09.078 --> 22:11.490
as payment for Paul
to murder your husband...

22:11.581 --> 22:14.038
so you could get a nice payout
from his life insurance policy.

22:14.125 --> 22:16.411
God, no.
I wouldn’t do that. No.

22:16.503 --> 22:19.085
No? Okay.
Why were you paying him?

22:20.590 --> 22:22.581
l was having an affair. Okay?

22:22.675 --> 22:25.462
Paul caught us together,
and he was blackmailing me.

22:25.553 --> 22:28.966
He said I had to pay him
$500 a month, or he was
gonna tell my husband.

22:29.057 --> 22:32.220
It’s amazing how complicated
deceitful relationships
can get, isn’t it?

22:32.310 --> 22:34.676
I’ll need to know
who you were sleeping with.

22:34.771 --> 22:38.514
Is that really necessary?
I mean, it’sjust
gonna hurt more people.

22:38.608 --> 22:41.816
If you didn’t murder
yourhusband,yeah,
it’s very necessary.

22:44.697 --> 22:46.483
He’s one of my students.

22:47.784 --> 22:50.651
His name is Randy Siminoff.

22:50.745 --> 22:53.407
George got him a job
working at Jesse’s chopper shop.

22:53.498 --> 22:55.113
He’s a student.
How old is he?

22:56.209 --> 22:57.790
Seventeen.

23:01.047 --> 23:05.040
Look, I know... it was stupid.

23:07.637 --> 23:09.252
Are you gonna
file charges against me?

23:09.347 --> 23:11.133
That’s up to the DA.

23:11.224 --> 23:13.215

Dr. Sweets.

- I don’t know. I don’t—

23:27.407 --> 23:29.238
He’s young, Mrs. Lyford.

23:29.325 --> 23:31.657
Too young to deal with
the situation you put him in.

23:31.744 --> 23:34.702
You know,
it’s possible he thought
if he killed your husband,

24:04.652 --> 24:06.517
I’ll be quick.

24:06.613 --> 24:08.854
I’m having
my psych evaluation later.

24:08.948 --> 24:11.360
I know. I normally do them,
but I recused myself.

24:12.577 --> 24:15.068
Because we still
have feelings?
Yes.

24:15.204 --> 24:17.286
That’s nice.
I know.

24:17.373 --> 24:20.661
The feelings,
not the recusing.

24:21.919 --> 24:23.750
It’s only ethical for me
to recuse myself.

No. It’s hurtful too.

No, I can’t tell you that.

24:31.012 --> 24:33.173
But you know
I’m brilliant at my job.

24:33.264 --> 24:37.098
And you know that people have
a tendency to misjudge me.

24:37.226 --> 24:39.968
Yeah.
Because they don’t
know me like you do.

24:40.063 --> 24:44.181
And it wouldn’t be fair for me
to lose my security clearance
because of that.

24:52.659 --> 24:54.445
No. Of course not.

24:54.535 --> 24:57.902
But, you know, it wouldn’t
be ethical for me to help you.

Okay? Okay.

find anotherjob.

Oh, Lancelot!

25:16.265 --> 25:18.472
- [ Knocking]
- Oh, so thank you.

25:18.559 --> 25:22.427
Okay. That’ll be it for today.
I, uh— I will schedule
our next appointment soon.

25:22.522 --> 25:24.558
Yes, Doctor.
Thank you, Doctor.

25:24.649 --> 25:27.311
You’re welcome, patient.

25:28.194 --> 25:30.685
So, Agent Coors,
lhope,uh,

25:30.780 --> 25:34.648
the books I gave you
on multiple personality
disorder helped.

25:36.577 --> 25:37.487
Okay.

25:39.122 --> 25:44.333
So after
I scanned in all the bones,
I remembered Girolamo Cardano.

25:44.419 --> 25:48.207
The 16th-century Italian
mathematician and anatomist?

25:48.297 --> 25:50.003
Yeah. That’s the guy.

25:50.091 --> 25:54.209
He developed a series
of mathematical equations to
describe the skeletal system.

25:54.303 --> 25:56.430
So programming the equations
into the computer,

25:56.514 --> 25:59.677
I was able to reconstruct
the skeletal system...

25:59.767 --> 26:03.760
the same way a forensic
architect could reconstruct
a collapsed building.

26:03.855 --> 26:06.346
- You straightened out the bones?
- I sure did.

26:06.441 --> 26:08.147
Check this out.

26:22.331 --> 26:24.071
Amazing.

26:24.167 --> 26:26.374
Now, there are marks
on the victim’s ilium.

26:28.212 --> 26:32.706
I don’t believe an injury
at that location would be fatal.

26:32.800 --> 26:34.882
But a nicked mandible could be.

26:34.969 --> 26:38.132
Especially if the carotid
was transected.

26:38.222 --> 26:41.009
- The victim
would’ve bled out.
- And we’d have cause of death.

26:43.060 --> 26:48.271
Based on the wound track,
which narrows to a point,
we’re looking at a knife.

26:48.357 --> 26:52.225
- So he was stabbed?
- Daisy will need to find
the actual warped bone...

26:52.320 --> 26:55.562
so she can swab
the wound for trace
from the murder weapon.

26:55.656 --> 26:56.691
No problem.

27:05.708 --> 27:07.209
That’s the one.

Hey, Hannah here was in
a real live camel race.

Why don’t you
tell him all about it.
I almost won.

27:28.064 --> 27:31.682
But the camel stopped
right before the finish line.

27:31.776 --> 27:34.688
He decided to take a nap,
right there, on the race track.

27:34.779 --> 27:37.441
- That’s funny, isn’t it?
- Can I go shoot some baskets?

27:37.532 --> 27:39.397
No, you can’t shoot
some baskets right now.

- Yeah. Tell her about
the volcano you made.

- Seeley, can I talk to you

I’d adopt one of those kids.

33:31.385 --> 33:33.797
No. You don’t need to.
You’ll be fine.

33:33.888 --> 33:37.096
- But—
- Trust me, Miss Daisy.

33:37.766 --> 33:39.552
You’ll be fine.

33:43.564 --> 33:46.931
Yeah, I was having sex
with Mrs. Lyford, but it was—
it was no big deal.

33:47.026 --> 33:51.144
While your peers might think
that having sex with an adult
is a kind of a victory,

33:51.238 --> 33:54.480
it’s still abusive,
and the psychological damage
can be significant.

33:54.575 --> 33:56.486
Dr. Sweets,
where is this going?

33:56.577 --> 33:58.863
As his child advocate,
I think you would know,
Ms. Hanover.

33:58.954 --> 34:01.366
Studies show that
as the relationship fails,

34:01.457 --> 34:04.324
the student often
feels powerless and angry.

34:04.418 --> 34:07.125
Look, Agent Booth
found a knife
in your locker.

34:07.213 --> 34:08.953
George Lyford
was killed with a knife.

34:09.048 --> 34:13.041
I brought it to school
to pry open a dude’s locker
and shove in a dead trout.

34:13.135 --> 34:14.636
It was a prank.

34:14.720 --> 34:17.302
He started it when he put
pepper spray in my gym shorts.

34:17.389 --> 34:20.381
Okay. Okay, let’s get back
to you and your teacher.

34:20.476 --> 34:22.091
Now, you claim
it was just sex.

34:22.228 --> 34:25.516
You had no
deeper feelings for her?
That’s right.

34:25.606 --> 34:27.892
But we have your
cell phone records, Randy.

34:27.983 --> 34:31.942
You and Mrs. Lyford talked
an average of two hours a day
for the past three months.

34:32.029 --> 34:34.145
That doesn’t sound
like just sex.

34:35.616 --> 34:37.447
[ Exhales ]
Okay. So I love her.

34:37.534 --> 34:40.571
I mean, why is that so crazy?
She loves me too.

34:40.663 --> 34:43.154
I could feel it.
But I didn’t kill anyone.

34:43.249 --> 34:46.036
l— I didn’t have to.
She would’ve left him.

34:46.126 --> 34:47.741
Randy, stop talking.

34:47.836 --> 34:49.792
I understand that
you’re here to protect him.

34:49.880 --> 34:53.714
But we need to know where
Randy was two nights ago
when George Lyford was killed.

34:54.843 --> 34:56.799
Home. Like every night.

34:56.887 --> 34:58.548
All right.
Was anyone home with you?

34:58.639 --> 35:03.099
[ Sighs ]
I live with my aunt.
But she works nights.

35:03.185 --> 35:06.643
[Sighs]
She loves me.

35:06.730 --> 35:08.766
Okay, I— I know that.

35:08.857 --> 35:10.939
She would’ve left him.

35:14.280 --> 35:17.022
I got the swab results back.
S.E.M. analysis...

35:17.116 --> 35:20.574
says the murder weapon was
a knife made of carbon steel.

35:20.661 --> 35:23.903
Which means it was forged
prior to 1964.

35:23.998 --> 35:27.661
But also it means that the knife
you found in Randy’s locker
was not the murder weapon.

35:27.751 --> 35:30.914
The knife
that stabbed our victim
was laminated in silver.

35:31.005 --> 35:34.168
Why would you laminate
a blade in silver?
It’s a soft metal.

35:34.258 --> 35:37.091
That’s right.
No one uses silver
to laminate a blade,

35:37.177 --> 35:39.668
unless it’s
the Damascus blade.

35:39.763 --> 35:42.630
You said that with
a great dramatic flourish.
Please continue.

35:42.725 --> 35:46.183
Hitler had 30 Damascus blades
hand forged...

35:46.270 --> 35:48.761
as presents
for his top commanders.

35:48.856 --> 35:51.472
Now those knives were
coveted by American G.|.’s.

35:51.567 --> 35:55.606
Some of them were taken
as souvenirs by soldiers
in Patton’s Third Army.

35:55.696 --> 35:58.108
The owner of the chopper shop
had a grandfather...

35:58.240 --> 36:00.026
who served in Patton’s
Third Army.
Third Army.

36:00.117 --> 36:01.448
Yeah, I know.

36:01.535 --> 36:03.867
The murder weapon must’ve
belonged to Jesse Wilson.

36:09.752 --> 36:12.164
What’s this about?
I told you about George.
I helped.

36:12.254 --> 36:15.212
And I appreciate that.
Now maybe you can explain, uh,

36:15.299 --> 36:17.915
why George Lyford
was killed with your knife.

36:18.010 --> 36:21.173
Whoa. Slow down.
You said George was shot.
He was stabbed to death?

36:21.263 --> 36:24.300
Stabbed. That’s right.
Patton’s Third Army.

36:24.391 --> 36:27.383
Grandfather brought back a knife
from Nazi Germany, didn’t he?

36:27.478 --> 36:30.595
Yeah. It was awesome.
But it was stolen from my shop.

36:30.689 --> 36:34.022
That’s pretty valuable
to just, uh, leave
lying around here, huh?

36:34.109 --> 36:35.724
Valuable? I didn’t know.

36:35.819 --> 36:38.401
I left it with the other stuff—
the helmets, medals, badges.

36:38.489 --> 36:41.572
It’s all gone now.
The Nazi stuff,
a bunch of my tools...

36:41.658 --> 36:43.444
and some chopper parts
were all jacked from my shop.

36:43.535 --> 36:46.447
- When was that, yesterday?
- No. Six months ago.

36:46.538 --> 36:49.746
I filed a police report.
I always suspected
Randy’s girlfriend,

36:49.875 --> 36:51.866
but I didn’t have any proof.
Randy had a girlfriend?

36:51.960 --> 36:54.747
On again, off again.
She’s trouble.

36:54.838 --> 36:56.920
After the stuff was jacked,
she didn’t come around so much.

36:57.007 --> 36:58.963
Hmm.

36:59.051 --> 37:01.463

37:42.803 --> 37:46.011
I’ve been approved.
I passed my psychological
evaluation.

37:46.098 --> 37:48.339
An absurd
and useless requirement.

37:48.434 --> 37:50.971
I agree. But when seen
through Lance’s eyes,

37:51.061 --> 37:52.722
psychology can be fascinating.

37:52.813 --> 37:54.519
When asked
what my favorite color was,

37:54.606 --> 37:58.269
I responded,
“Something in the 520
to 570 nanometer range.”

37:58.360 --> 38:01.102
[ Chuckles ]
They were baffled. Fools.

38:01.196 --> 38:04.984
I agree. But I’m glad
I made the cut. I can be
working here forever now.

38:05.075 --> 38:08.567
Then be useful.
I’m examining
the right ilium,

38:08.662 --> 38:10.618
which, due to demineralization,

38:10.706 --> 38:14.119
is now located where
we’d normally find
the ischial tuberosity.

38:14.209 --> 38:15.665
Why are you
examining the ilium?

38:15.752 --> 38:19.119
Angela identified
some faint impressions
on the bone.

38:22.134 --> 38:24.170
Upon further investigation,

38:24.261 --> 38:28.675
I realized there is
a second sequence that
converges with the first.

38:28.765 --> 38:31.552
- You think those marks
are probative?
- Not sure.

38:35.814 --> 38:39.306
To the naked eye,
these marks appear to be random.

38:39.401 --> 38:43.440
But if I extrapolate like so—

38:43.530 --> 38:47.022
What could possibly
form this shape on the ilium?

38:47.159 --> 38:50.367
May I? I’m authorized
to work on my own now.
Of course.

38:53.707 --> 38:56.369
Dr, Brennan, it’s a zipper!

38:56.460 --> 38:59.418
An open zipper.
And the teeth are bent.

38:59.505 --> 39:02.997
It’s been ripped open.
I— I saw someone do this
just yesterday.

39:03.091 --> 39:04.956
Very good work, Ms. Wick.

39:05.052 --> 39:09.261
Well, that’s what happens
when you have the faith
of the F.B.l. behind you.

39:09.348 --> 39:11.634
Hi. I asked if I could
deliver your ID. card myself.

39:11.725 --> 39:13.511
Oh.

39:13.644 --> 39:16.101
Congratulations.
[ Gasps ]

39:17.981 --> 39:19.096
[ Moans]

39:19.191 --> 39:21.273
I’ll clean that up. Oh!

39:21.401 --> 39:22.902
Put it on.
Okay.

39:31.453 --> 39:33.068
What are we doing out here,
Agent Booth?

39:33.163 --> 39:36.121
Amber said she would do
anything in order to cooperate
with the investigation.

39:36.208 --> 39:39.575
So we thought we’d bring
her here to the crime scene so
she could explain some things.

39:39.670 --> 39:42.252
- Explain what?
- We know it was you, Amber.

39:42.339 --> 39:45.081
- We know you killed
George Lyford.
- That’s crazy.

39:45.175 --> 39:48.793
We also know that
you pawned some stolen tools
from Jesse’s chopper shop.

39:48.887 --> 39:50.673
You know, pawn shops—
they keep records too.

39:50.764 --> 39:53.722
Jesse cut Randy’s pay, so I figured out
a way to make up the difference.

39:53.809 --> 39:55.765
Because
he was your boyfriend?

39:55.852 --> 39:57.843
- So?
- You know.

39:57.938 --> 40:01.647
You didn’t pawn
everything though, because
we found this in your bedroom.

40:01.733 --> 40:04.145
- That’s the murder weapon, Amber.
- He tried to rape me.

40:04.236 --> 40:06.147
That’s why George
drove me out here.

40:06.280 --> 40:10.023
You had the knife on you because
you thought George would be
angry enough to kill his wife.

40:10.117 --> 40:12.699
That way,
you could have Randy back.
But George wouldn’t help you.

40:12.786 --> 40:15.778
You thought you could get
revenge on Mrs. Lyford by
having sex with her husband.

40:15.872 --> 40:20.036
His zipper was ripped open
the same way you ripped
Randy’s zipper in detention.

40:20.168 --> 40:23.035
[ Booth ]
George didn’t want to have
sex with you. Randy dumped you.

40:23.130 --> 40:25.542
George pushed you away.
So you just went bonkers...

40:25.632 --> 40:27.873
and stabbed him
with the knife.

40:28.802 --> 40:31.134
Even if you can prove it,

40:31.221 --> 40:33.758
I’ll be out in a year, tops.

40:33.849 --> 40:36.682
I’m just a kid
from a broken home.

40:53.702 --> 40:55.943
So what’s going to happen
with the teacher?

40:56.038 --> 40:58.450
D.A.’s gonna press charges.
She’ll do time.

40:58.582 --> 41:00.868
Really?
Yeah.

41:00.959 --> 41:03.336
And don’t start telling me how
natural it is what she did...

41:03.420 --> 41:07.379
because the women in
the Ramalamadingdong tribe
like to sleep with teenage boys.

41:07.466 --> 41:11.129
I wasn’t.
I— I think it’s just that
the teacher pay for her actions,

41:11.219 --> 41:13.301
no matter what other societies
may accept.

41:13.388 --> 41:17.757
Although I have no knowledge
of the Ramalamadingdong tribe.

41:17.851 --> 41:20.558
Chief Shoobop-Shoobop—
invented rock and roll.

41:20.646 --> 41:23.353
Oh. A joke.
Very funny.

41:23.440 --> 41:28.150
Perhaps your chief knows
Chief Polyphony
of the Gavotte tribe.

41:28.236 --> 41:32.980
He invented baroque music
that always starts
on the third beat of the bar.

41:33.075 --> 41:35.066
[ Brennan Laughing]

41:35.160 --> 41:37.196
There they are.
Come on, kid.

41:37.287 --> 41:40.245
Dad, we went to the zoo.
They had camel rides.

41:40.332 --> 41:43.165
I was sure
he’d ridden one before.
He could be a jockey.

41:43.251 --> 41:46.334
The zoo, huh?
What happened to just
goin’ to get ice cream?

41:46.421 --> 41:48.161
Yeah, yeah. At the zoo.

41:48.256 --> 41:50.793
- We saw a lion pee
for, like, 10 minutes.
- Wow.

41:50.884 --> 41:53.125
That would be
physically impossible.

41:53.220 --> 41:55.552
An adult lion’s bladder,
when full,

41:55.639 --> 41:59.052
can hold approximately
1,500 milliliters of urine.

41:59.142 --> 42:02.885
The bladder would completely
empty in 37.5 seconds.

42:02.979 --> 42:06.107
She says weird stuff like that
all the time. She’s cool.

42:07.317 --> 42:08.773
Yes. We’re friends actually.

42:08.860 --> 42:10.851
She knows everything.
Watch this.

42:10.946 --> 42:13.858
- What animal farts the most?
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.

42:13.949 --> 42:16.941
The termite.
Because of their diet
and digestive process,

42:17.035 --> 42:19.947
they produce
as much methane gas
as human industry.

42:20.038 --> 42:21.653
But you can’t hear them.

42:21.748 --> 42:24.160
- Isn’t she cool?
- Very.

42:24.251 --> 42:27.539
We can go to her house
and go swim.
She can do a cannonball.

42:27.629 --> 42:29.745
- Oh.
- Hannah can come, can’t she?

42:29.840 --> 42:31.956
Sure.

42:34.261 --> 42:37.298
Hey, kid. Hey,
a little chocolate ice cream
on the chin there, kid?

42:37.389 --> 42:39.254
Yeah.
It’s my new favorite flavor.

42:39.349 --> 42:40.805
Wow.

42:41.852 --> 42:43.467
You’re amazing.

42:43.562 --> 42:45.302
