WEBVTT

00:03.900 --> 00:04.900
- HI.

00:04.900 --> 00:06.400
- OH, HI.
- HEY, MA.

00:06.400 --> 00:07.767
SO WHERE WERE YOU
ALL WEEKEND?

00:07.767 --> 00:09.700
- WELL, YOU REMEMBER
OUR DEAR OLD FRIENDS

00:09.700 --> 00:10.967
THE SANTORELLIS?

00:10.967 --> 00:15.767
SHE WORE ALL THAT MAKEUP
AND HE HAD THAT BAD TOUPEE?

00:15.767 --> 00:17.433
- YES, YOUR DEAR FRIENDS.

00:18.800 --> 00:21.000
- THEY BOUGHT A CONDOMINIUM
IN NEW JERSEY--

00:21.000 --> 00:23.067
THE GARDEN STATE VILLAS,

00:23.067 --> 00:25.133
AND CLAUDIA INVITED US DOWN.

00:25.133 --> 00:26.833
- OH, YEAH, THAT'S NICE, MA.

00:26.833 --> 00:29.500
YOU CAN RAYMOND ALL ABOUT IT.
BYE, GUYS.

00:29.500 --> 00:31.367
- NO, NO, NO, NO.
COME ON.

00:31.367 --> 00:32.600
I WANT YOU TO SIT DOWN.

00:32.600 --> 00:35.433
WE WANT TO HAVE A TALK
WITH ALL OF YOU.

00:37.167 --> 00:38.533
- THE LAST TIME
WE HAD A SIT-DOWN TALK,

00:38.533 --> 00:42.233
YOU TOLD US YOU WERE
GIVING OUR DOG AWAY.

00:42.233 --> 00:43.933
- [mock crying]

00:43.933 --> 00:47.467
"YOU GAVE MY DOGGIE AWAY!"

00:50.767 --> 00:53.300
- ROBERT, NOW STOP IT
THIS INSTANT.

00:53.300 --> 00:56.600
OKAY, SO WE HAD
A WONDERFUL TIME.

00:56.600 --> 00:58.433
- NO DOGS THERE.

00:58.433 --> 01:01.000
- FRANK!

01:01.000 --> 01:04.600
AND THE CONDO
WAS JUST BEAUTIFUL.

01:04.600 --> 01:07.167
AND THE FOOD
WAS ESPECIALLY GOOD.

01:07.167 --> 01:12.467
- YEAH, I HAD A STEAK SO BIG
I ALMOST COULDN'T FINISH IT.

01:12.467 --> 01:15.467
AND THEN I DID.

01:15.467 --> 01:16.967
- GREAT, SEE,
THAT'S WHY YOU GUYS

01:16.967 --> 01:18.367
SHOULD HAVE A VIDEO CAMERA.

01:18.367 --> 01:19.367
- HEY!

01:19.367 --> 01:20.767
YOUR MOTHER'S TALKING.

01:20.767 --> 01:23.500
NO TV NOW.

01:29.067 --> 01:33.833
- SO ON THE DRIVE HOME,
WE STARTED TALKING,

01:33.833 --> 01:36.467
AND, WELL, WE...

01:37.333 --> 01:39.333
- WHAT IS IT, MARIE?

01:43.033 --> 01:45.600
- WE WANT TO MOVE THERE.

02:08.233 --> 02:10.667
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN

02:10.667 --> 02:14.367
MOVE THERE?

02:14.367 --> 02:17.267
- WE'RE JUST
THINKING ABOUT IT.

02:17.267 --> 02:19.733
- I WANT TO LIVE THERE.

02:21.333 --> 02:23.533
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN...

02:23.533 --> 02:27.000
LIVE THERE?

02:27.000 --> 02:28.867
- MARIE, THIS PLACE
IS SO GREAT,

02:28.867 --> 02:32.567
YOU'D REALLY CONSIDER MOVING
ALL THE WAY TO NEW JERSEY?

02:32.567 --> 02:36.033
- WE'RE JUST THINKING
ABOUT IT.

02:36.033 --> 02:38.600
BUT I HAVE TO SAY
THAT EVERYONE THERE

02:38.600 --> 02:40.533
SEEMED SO ACTIVE.

02:40.533 --> 02:43.200
'CAUSE USUALLY WHEN YOU THINK
ABOUT A RETIREMENT COMMUNITY,

02:43.200 --> 02:44.800
IT'S DEPRESSING.

02:44.800 --> 02:48.633
- YES, I GENERALLY DON'T CARE
FOR THE ELDERLY.

02:57.100 --> 02:59.133
- BUT THEIR DAYS ARE SO FULL.

02:59.133 --> 03:01.767
THEY'VE GOT GOLF
AND A HEALTH SPA

03:01.767 --> 03:05.100
AND THEME NIGHTS.

03:05.100 --> 03:09.067
MEANWHILE, FRANK AND I,
WE HAD A GOOD TIME.

03:09.067 --> 03:13.067
I HAVEN'T HAD THAT MUCH FUN
WITH YOUR FATHER IN A LONG TIME.

03:13.067 --> 03:15.233
[chuckles]

03:21.467 --> 03:23.333
WE LAUGHED,

03:23.333 --> 03:26.100
AND WE TOOK WALKS,

03:26.100 --> 03:28.433
AND WE HELD HANDS.

03:38.500 --> 03:40.233
- DAD?

03:40.233 --> 03:43.333
- THEY GOT
CHEAP BOOZE THERE.

03:45.033 --> 03:47.133
- NO, WHAT THIS WEEKEND
MADE ME REALIZE

03:47.133 --> 03:50.233
IS THAT ALLY
IS OLD ENOUGH TO BABY-SIT.

03:50.233 --> 03:53.367
AND, ROBERT,
I FINALLY GOT YOU MARRIED OFF.

03:55.167 --> 03:59.333
AND, DEBRA,
I'VE TAUGHT YOU ALL I CAN.

04:05.767 --> 04:09.367
BUT AT THE COMMUNITY--
THAT'S WHAT THEY CALL IT--

04:09.367 --> 04:12.100
THERE ARE SO MANY
OTHER WOMEN THERE JUST LIKE ME.

04:12.100 --> 04:16.000
- I KNOW THAT SOUNDS CHILLING,
BUT IT WASN'T SO BAD.

04:22.467 --> 04:25.633
- AND CLAUDIA
TOOK US TO THE REHEARSAL SPACE

04:25.633 --> 04:27.067
FOR THE DRAMA CLUB,

04:27.067 --> 04:28.600
AND, OH, SHE STARTED
TO GO ON AND ON

04:28.600 --> 04:32.033
ABOUT WHAT A LOVELY
SINGING VOICE I HAD

04:32.033 --> 04:33.900
IN CHURCH CHOIR.

04:33.900 --> 04:36.933
IT WAS EMBARRASSING.

04:36.933 --> 04:39.367
AND THEN SHE SAID

04:39.367 --> 04:41.867
THAT SHE THOUGHT
I WOULD BE PERFECT,

04:41.867 --> 04:45.467
PERFECT TO PLAY THE LEAD
IN THE FALL PRODUCTION

04:45.467 --> 04:49.300
OF "THE UNSINKABLE MOLLY BROWN"!

04:52.000 --> 04:55.100
- MIGHT HAVE TO CHANGE
THE TITLE.

04:57.333 --> 04:59.833
- SO YOU WANT TO MOVE AWAY?

04:59.833 --> 05:02.733
BUT WOULDN'T YOU MISS...

05:02.733 --> 05:04.233
RAYMOND?

05:05.500 --> 05:09.433
- OH, I'M NOT SAYING
THIS WOULD BE EASY.

05:09.433 --> 05:13.233
BUT EVERYONE THERE TOLD US

05:13.233 --> 05:15.100
THAT THEIR RELATIONSHIP
WITH THEIR CHILDREN

05:15.100 --> 05:18.700
AND THEIR GRANDCHILDREN
HAS NEVER BEEN BETTER.

05:22.733 --> 05:26.333
- I CAN'T BREATHE.

05:26.333 --> 05:28.767
- NOTHING IS SET, HONEY.

05:28.767 --> 05:30.733
THAT'S WHY WE WANTED
TO TALK IT OVER.

05:30.733 --> 05:32.900
AND IT WOULDN'T BE LIKE
WE WOULDN'T SEE YOU.

05:32.900 --> 05:35.500
WE'RE ONLY 85 MINUTES AWAY.

05:35.500 --> 05:40.200
- SPEAKING OF THAT,
I HAVEN'T EATEN FOR 85 MINUTES.

05:40.200 --> 05:43.767
- I'LL GET YOU SOMETHING, FRANK.

05:43.767 --> 05:47.233
- WAIT. I'LL HELP YOU.

05:54.000 --> 05:55.633
- WOW.

05:55.633 --> 05:56.833
- YEAH.

05:56.833 --> 05:58.200
WOW.

06:01.633 --> 06:04.733
- WOWEE!
- WOWEE!

06:07.467 --> 06:10.533
85 MINUTES!
85 MINUTES!

06:10.533 --> 06:12.867
- I KNOW. I KNOW.
85 MINUTES!

06:12.867 --> 06:15.533
IT'S MY NEW FAVORITE NUMBER.

06:15.533 --> 06:17.967
- NO, WAIT, IT COULD EVEN BE
MORE IF YOU COUNT TRAFFIC.

06:17.967 --> 06:19.267
- TRAFFIC!

06:19.267 --> 06:20.500
WE HAVE NEVER HAD TRAFFIC
BETWEEN US.

06:20.500 --> 06:22.267
TRAFFIC!

06:23.467 --> 06:25.633
- ALTHOUGH--
ALTHOUGH IT WOULD BE WEIRD.

06:25.633 --> 06:28.000
I MEAN, THEY'VE ALWAYS
BEEN RIGHT ACROSS THE STREET.

06:28.000 --> 06:30.833
I CAN'T IMAGINE THEM
NOT BEING THERE.

06:30.833 --> 06:33.167
ACTUALLY I CAN.
- ME TOO!

06:38.200 --> 06:39.600
- WAIT A MINUTE.

06:39.600 --> 06:41.533
YOU'RE ACTUALLY THINKING
ABOUT GIVING UP A HOUSE

06:41.533 --> 06:43.400
THAT YOU'VE LIVED IN
FOR ALMOST 50 YEARS?

06:43.400 --> 06:46.267
YOU'RE SURE YOU DON'T
WANT TO TRY TO JUST, YOU KNOW,

06:46.267 --> 06:48.733
FINISH THINGS UP HERE?

06:54.433 --> 06:59.833
- ACTUALLY, WE--WE DISCUSSED
WHAT TO DO WITH THE HOUSE TOO,

06:59.833 --> 07:01.033
DIDN'T WE, FRANK?

07:01.033 --> 07:02.767
- YEP.

07:03.867 --> 07:05.800
- IF WE DO MOVE, ROBERT,

07:05.800 --> 07:10.000
WE WANT YOU AND AMY
TO TAKE THE HOUSE.

07:13.867 --> 07:15.233
- WHAT?

07:15.233 --> 07:16.967
- HEY, TAKE IT EASY.

07:16.967 --> 07:19.267
WE WOULDN'T JUST GIVE IT AWAY.

07:19.267 --> 07:22.367
WE'D SELL IT TO YOU.

07:22.367 --> 07:25.533
- WE'D SELL IT FOR THE PRICE
THAT WE PAID:

07:25.533 --> 07:28.167
$26,000.

07:35.200 --> 07:38.267
- THAT IS AN AMAZING OFFER.

07:38.267 --> 07:41.267
- YES, IT--IT SURE IS.

07:41.267 --> 07:43.967
BUT AS MUCH
AS I LOVE THAT HOUSE,

07:43.967 --> 07:47.700
YOU KNOW, I WOULDN'T WANT IT
IF IT MEANS YOU GUYS LEAVING.

07:47.700 --> 07:52.400
- HE'S RIGHT.
I WOULDN'T WANT IT THAT WAY.

07:54.100 --> 07:55.367
- YOU KNOW WHAT?

07:55.367 --> 07:57.967
I THINK I NEED
A DRINK OR SOMETHING.

07:57.967 --> 07:59.300
EXCUSE ME.

08:02.800 --> 08:04.333
- GET ME SOMETHING TOO.

08:04.333 --> 08:06.767
AND WHERE'S MY SNACK?

08:21.733 --> 08:25.033
- WE'RE COMFORTING
EACH OTHER.

08:26.033 --> 08:28.033
IT'S OKAY.

08:29.800 --> 08:31.200
- THIS IS SOMETHING, HUH?

08:31.200 --> 08:34.200
- YEAH,
SOMETHING.

08:34.200 --> 08:37.333
- SOMETHING.

08:42.767 --> 08:47.167
- IT'S UNBELIEVABLE!

08:53.833 --> 08:55.700
THIS IS AMAZING!

08:57.033 --> 08:59.667
- TAKE IT EASY.
THEY'RE RIGHT IN THERE.

08:59.667 --> 09:02.767
- I'M A LITTLE EXCITED.
I'M A LITTLE EXCITED.

09:02.767 --> 09:05.067
I'M JUST A LITTLE EXCITED.

09:05.067 --> 09:07.400
- WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.
- SHHH.

09:07.400 --> 09:11.033
WAIT TILL YOU HEAR
THE BEST PART.

09:11.033 --> 09:12.500
- WE GET THE HOUSE.

09:12.500 --> 09:14.333
- WHAT?
-
OUR OWN HOUSE!

09:14.333 --> 09:15.933
- YOU GET THE HOUSE?

09:15.933 --> 09:19.000
- WE GET THE HOUSE.
$26,000.

09:19.000 --> 09:21.567
- WH-WHY DO YOU GET THAT?

09:21.567 --> 09:23.733
- WHAT DO YOU CARE, RAY?
- $26,000!

09:23.733 --> 09:26.800
- 85 MINUTES.
- YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT!

09:26.800 --> 09:29.733
[cheering]

09:50.600 --> 09:54.300
- THE KIDS SEEM
PRETTY SHAKEN UP.

10:01.100 --> 10:02.600
- YEAH.

10:02.600 --> 10:05.333
- I FEEL BAD.

10:05.333 --> 10:07.100
- HOW ARE WE GONNA
BREAK IT TO THEM

10:07.100 --> 10:11.600
THAT WE ALREADY SIGNED
THE LEASE?

10:11.600 --> 10:16.067
- I DON'T WANT IT TO FEEL
LIKE WE'RE RUNNING OUT ON THEM.

10:16.067 --> 10:18.100
I MEAN, THEY SHOULD
TELL US TO GO.

10:18.100 --> 10:20.333
IT SHOULD COME FROM THEM.

10:20.333 --> 10:22.267
- HOW ARE YOU GONNA
GET THEM TO DO THAT?

10:22.267 --> 10:25.000
- WELL, JUST LET ME
DO THE TALKING.

10:27.033 --> 10:31.167
- THAT SHOULD MAKE THEM
WANT US TO GO.

10:31.167 --> 10:32.567
- [chuckles]

10:32.567 --> 10:34.300
OH, YOU.

10:36.233 --> 10:38.533
IT'S EXCITING,
ISN'T IT, CHI-CHI?

10:38.533 --> 10:40.767
- [giggles]

10:51.633 --> 10:53.600
[all sigh]

11:02.767 --> 11:05.467
- IT'S--IT'S NOT EASY
TO THINK ABOUT.

11:05.467 --> 11:08.867
- YOU GOT THAT RIGHT, YEAH.

11:08.867 --> 11:11.467
- IT IS A PAINFUL TIME.

11:16.733 --> 11:19.333
- WE REALLY ENJOYED
THIS WEEKEND,

11:19.333 --> 11:21.733
MORE THAN WE HAVE
IN A LONG TIME.

11:23.633 --> 11:29.133
MAYBE IT'S NOT THE RIGHT TIME
TO MAKE SUCH A BIG CHANGE.

11:36.333 --> 11:39.300
- YOU KNOW, MOM...

11:39.300 --> 11:41.400
THERE'S NOTHING WRONG

11:41.400 --> 11:46.233
WITH YOU DOING SOMETHING
FOR YOURSELF ONCE IN A WHILE.

11:46.233 --> 11:50.500
- YES, YOU ARE ALWAYS
THINKING OF EVERYONE ELSE.

11:52.400 --> 11:57.367
- YOU GIVE, GIVE,
AND THEN YOU GIVE SOME MORE.

11:57.367 --> 12:00.767
- YES, AND YOU TOO, FRANK.

12:09.400 --> 12:12.600
- IT HAS ALWAYS BEEN
ABOUT OTHERS.

12:16.333 --> 12:19.167
- SO WHAT DO YOU THINK, MARIE?

12:21.500 --> 12:23.200
- [sighs]

12:26.200 --> 12:27.400
OKAY, LET'S DO IT.

12:27.400 --> 12:29.367
[restrained squeals]
GREAT!

12:47.067 --> 12:48.500
- HOW GREAT IS IT

12:48.500 --> 12:52.700
THAT MY PARENTS ARE MOVING
INTO A FURNISHED PLACE?

12:58.133 --> 12:59.800
- YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE IS GREAT?

12:59.800 --> 13:01.433
A YARD SALE.

13:03.733 --> 13:05.533
- HEY.

13:05.533 --> 13:09.067
- WOW, LOOK, HONEY,
OUR NEIGHBORS HAVE STOPPED BY.

13:09.067 --> 13:10.900
- HOWDY, NEIGHBOR.

13:10.900 --> 13:12.100
- HOWDY,
NEIGHBOR.

13:12.100 --> 13:14.767
[laughs]

13:14.767 --> 13:19.133
- WOW, LOOK AT THIS PLACE.

13:19.133 --> 13:21.033
- YEAH.
- [exhales]

13:21.033 --> 13:22.367
- YOU OKAY?

13:22.367 --> 13:25.833
- YEAH, I GUESS IT'S--IT'S--

13:25.833 --> 13:27.567
THIS IS ALL
JUST HITTING ME.

13:27.567 --> 13:29.500
IT'S REALLY HAPPENING, HUH?

13:29.500 --> 13:31.533
- OH, YEAH!
NO KIDDING IT'S HAPPENING.

13:31.533 --> 13:33.600
I GOT SOME PARTY HATS
AND NOISEMAKERS.

13:33.600 --> 13:35.100
HUH, SEE THAT?

13:35.100 --> 13:37.367
GOT THE CHAMPAGNE
IN THE FRIDGE.

13:37.367 --> 13:38.767
BUH, BUH, BUH--MY CHAIR!

13:38.767 --> 13:40.200
- OH!

13:45.900 --> 13:48.433
- WHAT'S WITH YOU?

13:48.433 --> 13:51.333
- I JUST HAVEN'T BEEN OVER HERE
SINCE THEY PACKED.

13:51.333 --> 13:54.433
WEIRD, ISN'T IT?

13:54.433 --> 13:56.033
- YEAH.

13:56.033 --> 13:59.733
CLOSING DAY
AT THE MENTAL INSTITUTION.

14:02.500 --> 14:05.200
- YEP, FINAL CLEARANCE.
ALL CRAZIES MUST GO.

14:05.200 --> 14:06.500
[laughing]

14:06.500 --> 14:10.033
- COME ON, COME ON.
- WHAT?

14:10.033 --> 14:11.667
- I DON'T KNOW.

14:11.667 --> 14:13.833
IT'S JUST THAT NOW
THAT IT'S ACTUALLY HAPPENING,

14:13.833 --> 14:17.000
I FEEL...

14:17.000 --> 14:20.367
- LIKE RUINING EVERYTHING?

14:22.500 --> 14:25.267
- SAD.

14:25.267 --> 14:28.300
I-I'M GONNA MISS THEM.

14:28.300 --> 14:30.633
THEY'RE MY FAMILY.

14:30.633 --> 14:33.967
- OH, WELL, OF COURSE.
WE ALL FEEL THAT.

14:33.967 --> 14:35.533
- YEAH, SURE.

14:35.533 --> 14:37.633
- NO, OF COURSE.
THEY'RE LIKE FAMILY, YEAH.

14:42.600 --> 14:47.200
- YOU KNOW, I MEAN,
I'VE SPENT MORE TIME WITH THEM

14:47.200 --> 14:48.833
THAN ANYONE
OVER THE LAST TEN YEARS.

14:48.833 --> 14:50.733
I MEAN, 'CAUSE RAY,
YOU GO TO WORK EVERY DAY,

14:50.733 --> 14:52.700
AND YOU GUYS SEE THEM, WHAT,
A COUPLE TIMES A WEEK.

14:52.700 --> 14:55.867
I'VE BEEN WITH THEM EVERY DAY--
MORNING, NOON, AND NIGHT.

14:55.867 --> 14:57.100
- THAT'S WHY YOU SHOULD BE

14:57.100 --> 14:59.833
DANCING AROUND NAKED
IN A FOUNTAIN.

14:59.833 --> 15:01.533
- [sighs]

15:05.167 --> 15:07.167
I KNOW, I KNOW.

15:07.167 --> 15:08.700
IT'S JUST--

15:08.700 --> 15:10.467
IT'S JUST ALL HAPPENING
SO QUICK, YOU KNOW?

15:10.467 --> 15:13.500
IT'S LIKE,
"BOOM, SEE YA, BYE."

15:13.500 --> 15:15.300
OH, GOSH.

15:15.300 --> 15:16.833
I DON'T KNOW.

15:16.833 --> 15:21.767
I'M ALWAYS LOOKING
FOR THE WORST IN MARIE, AND...

15:21.767 --> 15:23.533
I JUST SHOULDN'T.

15:25.400 --> 15:27.200
- OH!

15:27.200 --> 15:29.433
AH, WAIT, WAIT.

15:29.433 --> 15:31.067
DEB...

15:31.067 --> 15:33.267
IS THIS YOUR...

15:33.267 --> 15:35.800
YOU KNOW, LADIES TIME?

15:35.800 --> 15:38.967
- NO, RAY, THAT'S NOT IT.

15:38.967 --> 15:41.067
- ALL RIGHT. OKAY.

15:41.967 --> 15:43.667
I'M SORRY.

15:44.833 --> 15:46.167
BUT IT'S COMING SOON, RIGHT?

15:46.167 --> 15:49.133
- NO, RAY.
- OKAY, SORRY, SORRY.

15:49.133 --> 15:52.000
[whispers]
LADIES TIME.

15:55.067 --> 15:57.733
- NO, DEB,
I SEE WHAT YOU'RE SAYING.

15:57.733 --> 15:58.933
- NO, YOU DON'T.

15:58.933 --> 16:00.633
IT'S ONE THING
TO BE SAD, OKAY?

16:00.633 --> 16:01.933
I'M ALL FOR SAD...

16:01.933 --> 16:04.933
AFTER THEY'RE GONE

16:04.933 --> 16:07.733
AND AFTER THE PARTY,
ALL RIGHT?

16:07.733 --> 16:09.167
I'M SORRY, DEBRA,

16:09.167 --> 16:11.167
BUT MY MOM IS IN A VERY
EMOTIONAL STATE RIGHT NOW,

16:11.167 --> 16:14.467
AND YOUR SUDDEN INSANITY
JUST MIGHT MAKE HER STAY.

16:14.467 --> 16:16.333
ALL RIGHT, I BOUGHT THIS HOUSE
FAIR AND SQUARE.

16:16.333 --> 16:19.600
$26,000 FOR A HOUSE!

16:22.900 --> 16:25.033
- I'M JUST HAVING FEELINGS.

16:25.033 --> 16:27.100
- WELL, WE ALL HAVE THOSE,

16:27.100 --> 16:29.300
BUT THERE'S A TIME
TO EXPRESS THEM

16:29.300 --> 16:33.867
AND A TIME TO JUST
KEEP THAT CRAP INSIDE.

16:33.867 --> 16:35.067
- GOOD FOR YOU.

16:35.067 --> 16:37.500
GOOD FOR YOU. YES.

16:38.900 --> 16:41.600
- LOOK, IT'S JUST, I ALWAYS
THOUGHT THAT MARIE AND I

16:41.600 --> 16:46.200
WOULD ONE DAY LEARN TO,
YOU KNOW, GET ALONG.

16:46.200 --> 16:49.600
I CANNOT JUST LET HER LEAVE
AND SAY NOTHING.

16:49.600 --> 16:50.800
- GET HER.

16:50.800 --> 16:52.000
- STAY WHERE YOU ARE.

16:52.000 --> 16:53.233
- GET OUT OF MY WAY,
ROBERT.

16:53.233 --> 16:55.433
- ALL RIGHT.

16:55.433 --> 16:57.333
- WELL, I GUESS
THAT'S EVERYTHING.

16:57.333 --> 16:59.300
- MARIE, I WANT
TO SAY SOMETHING.

16:59.300 --> 17:02.433
- GOOD-BYE, WE LOVE YOU.

17:02.433 --> 17:03.733
I GUESS IT'S TIME TO GO.

17:03.733 --> 17:05.533
- YEAH, YEAH,
IS IT 4:00 ALREADY?

17:05.533 --> 17:08.167
REMEMBER THE TRAFFIC,
DAD, HUH?

17:08.167 --> 17:11.733
- HOLY CRAP, MARIE.
LET'S HIT IT.

17:11.733 --> 17:14.833
- MARIE, I HAVE SOME
UNRESOLVED FEELINGS.

17:14.833 --> 17:17.900
- OW!

17:17.900 --> 17:19.567
- OKAY.

17:19.567 --> 17:23.900
I KNOW I SHOULD HAVE
SAID THIS YEARS AGO, BUT...

17:23.900 --> 17:25.367
WE KIND OF--

17:25.367 --> 17:30.733
NO, WE HAVE BUTTED HEADS
A LOT OVER THE YEARS, AND...

17:30.733 --> 17:34.567
WE'VE SAID SOME
UNFORTUNATE THINGS

17:34.567 --> 17:36.833
TO EACH OTHER
AND ABOUT EACH OTHER,

17:36.833 --> 17:42.800
AND I GUESS WE'VE JUST
DECIDED THAT THAT'S HOW IT IS.

17:42.800 --> 17:47.933
BUT I KNOW THAT YOU AND I
ARE NOT OKAY

17:47.933 --> 17:51.433
WITH THE WAY THINGS
ARE BETWEEN US.

17:51.433 --> 17:54.333
YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU TOLD ME
THAT YOU WERE MOVING,

17:54.333 --> 17:56.200
I WAS HAPPY BECAUSE IT MEANT

17:56.200 --> 17:58.000
I WOULDN'T HAVE TO DEAL
WITH ALL THE FIGHTING

17:58.000 --> 18:00.333
AND THE TENSION.

18:00.333 --> 18:03.067
BUT I DON'T LIKE
FEELING THAT WAY.

18:03.067 --> 18:05.500
I FEEL LIKE
WE'RE JUST GIVING UP,

18:05.500 --> 18:06.900
AND I DON'T WANT TO DO THAT.

18:06.900 --> 18:08.333
I DON'T.

18:08.333 --> 18:10.867
I...

18:10.867 --> 18:15.767
I THINK THAT THERE COULD BE
SO MUCH MORE FOR US.

18:15.767 --> 18:17.967
AND I'M SORRY THAT
WE HAVEN'T GOTTEN THERE YET,

18:17.967 --> 18:20.633
BUT I THINK THAT WE CAN.

18:23.933 --> 18:27.200
- OH, DEBRA.

18:27.200 --> 18:31.167
DO YOU KNOW
WHAT YOUR PROBLEM IS?

18:36.033 --> 18:40.600
YOU'RE ALWAYS SO DRAMATIC.

18:40.600 --> 18:45.733
I'M FINE
WITH THE WAY WE ARE.

18:45.733 --> 18:46.933
- HAVE A GREAT TRIP.

18:46.933 --> 18:50.167
- OH, THANK YOU, DEAR.

18:50.167 --> 18:51.500
- TICK-TOCK, MARIE.

18:51.500 --> 18:52.900
- OH, MARIE,
I'LL MISS YOU.

18:52.900 --> 18:55.667
- OH, AND I'LL MISS YOU TOO.

18:55.667 --> 18:57.433
OH, ROBBIE.

18:57.433 --> 18:58.567
ROBBIE.

18:58.567 --> 19:02.600
OH, YOU'RE SUCH A GOOD BOY.

19:02.600 --> 19:04.733
I KNOW THE HOUSE
WILL BE IN FINE HANDS

19:04.733 --> 19:07.600
WITH YOU TWO LIVING IN IT.

19:07.600 --> 19:08.967
- THANKS, MA.

19:08.967 --> 19:10.167
AND I JUST WANT TO SAY--

19:10.167 --> 19:11.633
- RAYMOND!

19:11.633 --> 19:14.567
[sobbing]

19:18.100 --> 19:19.833
- IT'S OKAY.
IT'S OKAY.

19:19.833 --> 19:22.033
- YEAH, MARIE, LET'S GET
TO THE RETIREMENT VILLAGE

19:22.033 --> 19:25.233
WHILE WE'RE STILL YOUNG.

19:25.233 --> 19:27.533
- ALL RIGHT,
ALL RIGHT.

19:30.100 --> 19:32.067
GOOD-BYE.

19:32.067 --> 19:34.867
I'LL MISS YOU ALL.

19:34.867 --> 19:38.800
AND THERE'S SOME NICE FRUIT
IN THE REFRIGERATOR.

19:38.800 --> 19:43.067
WE ALWAYS HAVE
TOO MUCH FRUIT IN THIS HOUSE.

19:43.067 --> 19:44.700
WE'LL CALL YOU
WHEN WE GET THERE.

19:46.267 --> 19:49.933
- WAIT, WAIT.

19:49.933 --> 19:53.100
UH...

19:53.100 --> 19:55.000
WELL, WE SHOULD THROW YOU
LIKE A...

19:55.000 --> 19:58.633
A GOING-AWAY PARTY,
YOU KNOW?

19:58.633 --> 20:00.367
HERE, SEE?

20:00.367 --> 20:02.833
IT'S LIKE A PARTY.

20:02.833 --> 20:05.100
- HEY, YOU'RE COMING OUT
NEXT WEEKEND.

20:06.167 --> 20:07.600
- RAY'S RIGHT.

20:07.600 --> 20:10.467
WOULDN'T IT BE NICE
TO MARK THE OCCASION?

20:10.467 --> 20:14.767
- YEAH, DAD, DON'T YOU WANT
TO SAY A REAL GOOD-BYE?

20:14.767 --> 20:19.000
- AW, COME ON, WE'RE NOT GOING
TO THE CEMETERY.

20:19.000 --> 20:21.467
JUST JERSEY.

20:36.100 --> 20:38.200
- WHAT IS IT, FRANK?

20:38.200 --> 20:40.333
- NOTHING.

20:40.333 --> 20:44.467
I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT
IF I SHOULD PEE FIRST.

20:50.433 --> 20:54.000
AW, WHAT THE HELL?
I'LL MAKE IT INTERESTING.

20:59.733 --> 21:04.333
- OKAY, WELL...

21:04.333 --> 21:07.067
YOU WANT TO SIT DOWN?

21:40.933 --> 21:44.067
[blows noisemaker]
