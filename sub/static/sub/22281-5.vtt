00:21.967 --> 00:23.467
SUE AIKENS: All of my food
got wiped out.

00:23.667 --> 00:26.767
I need to now replace
from ground zero.

00:27.400 --> 00:31.267
NARRATOR: Several months ago,
a horrifying accident left
Sue Aikens injured

00:31.533 --> 00:32.700
and her camp unattended.

00:33.533 --> 00:37.533
Upon her return, she was
forced to dispose of spoiled
meat from Kavik's food supply.

00:38.067 --> 00:40.900
SUE: Probably lost around
$18,000 in food.

00:42.333 --> 00:44.167
NARRATOR: She has begun to
restock her food,

00:44.633 --> 00:48.533
but to survive the winter
ahead, she'll need more meat
and protein.

00:50.433 --> 00:52.467
Caribou right here.
Half a mile.

00:53.233 --> 00:54.267
Yep.

00:54.633 --> 00:55.900
Time to go.

00:58.867 --> 01:03.100
I've got no time to prepare,
but I gotta get meat.

01:03.167 --> 01:04.900
I don't get meat,
I don't have nothing.

01:05.300 --> 01:08.100
Real nervous about trying to
take a shot with this.

01:08.533 --> 01:10.067
I don't wanna pooch it.

01:10.533 --> 01:13.733
I am gonna have to get
right up his backside.

01:14.200 --> 01:15.967
And I'm on the road.

01:50.933 --> 01:55.633
It could be that the caribou,
they're not alarmed, they're
just looking for food.

01:56.300 --> 01:58.000
He could have come here,
and he's gonna follow it down.

01:58.067 --> 02:00.333
The caribou migrated out
almost all in force.

02:00.400 --> 02:04.633
They came through here, couple
hundred-thousand thick,
and went south early.

02:04.700 --> 02:05.833
Three months early.

02:05.900 --> 02:08.100
Anything I see I've gotta
try and get.

02:10.333 --> 02:13.733
I'm not giving up. But it sure
would have been nice to see
him standing this way.

02:15.900 --> 02:19.767
I know, those little son
of a guns, they're right
here, they're right here.

02:21.033 --> 02:22.367
I know it.

02:24.133 --> 02:26.467
Perfect opportunity
fucking gone.

02:31.900 --> 02:33.967
CHIP HAILSTONE: If you can't
teach 'em how to
make a lot of money,

02:34.033 --> 02:36.767
you can teach 'em how
to live without it
and be proud and happy.

02:36.833 --> 02:38.800
That's really the best
education you can
give a kid.

02:48.167 --> 02:51.467
So we're gonna set this net,
and we're gonna catch
ourselves a bunch of salmon.

02:51.700 --> 02:53.633
And we have different kinds of
salmon that come here.

02:54.100 --> 02:56.733
And er, we're gonna make
dog food and people food.

02:56.833 --> 03:00.400
And food for gifts and giving
and trading and whatever else
we feel like doing.

03:03.967 --> 03:07.367
NARRATOR: For the Hailstones,
it is crucial to harvest
migrating salmon

03:07.433 --> 03:08.867
to survive the coming winter.

03:09.300 --> 03:12.700
They will spend several days
net fishing, a native method

03:12.767 --> 03:14.167
that has been passed down
for generations.

03:16.667 --> 03:17.667
AGNES: Check it out.

03:17.733 --> 03:19.700
You can see the fish splashing
already.

03:20.200 --> 03:21.367
Fun!

03:21.833 --> 03:25.533
So we're hoping
there's quite a few fish
out there.

03:25.600 --> 03:28.067
CHIP: Feel free to advance in
the boat.
Thank you, dear.

03:28.333 --> 03:29.767
Bring it upside,
bring it upside.

03:33.167 --> 03:35.667
AGNES: Oh, fish on!
(EXCLAIMS)

03:35.833 --> 03:38.300
We're definitely gonna have
salmon dinner tonight.

03:43.233 --> 03:46.967
Boy, that was fun watching
the fish get caught to the net
as you pull it.

03:47.533 --> 03:49.233
CHIP: Have a salmon
for dinner.

03:49.600 --> 03:52.167
Salmon are a valuable
resource, really valuable
in Alaska.

03:52.233 --> 03:55.133
Tasty fish, they're full
of fats, full of oils.

03:55.700 --> 03:59.133
They've got a lot of good
vitamins and minerals
and proteins,

03:59.533 --> 04:01.000
and it's all just
good for you.

04:01.067 --> 04:02.967
It's fish. It's brain food,
you know?

04:03.033 --> 04:06.900
Well, I got two fish but it's
still catching the boat more
than it's catching fish.

04:07.133 --> 04:08.600
Fucking boat.

04:10.200 --> 04:15.800
Not a good boat for checking
a net in. Everything is
caught on everything.

04:16.867 --> 04:19.467
Any boat's a good boat to
check a net in if you're
really trying to,

04:19.533 --> 04:21.533
but this one's not ideal.

04:22.067 --> 04:25.800
This one right here has
lots of snags and rivets
and screws

04:26.000 --> 04:28.267
and oarlocks and back corners.

04:28.367 --> 04:30.867
We have an older boat that's
a Boston Whaler.

04:30.933 --> 04:32.567
And I'm thinking I'm gonna go
pick that up.

04:32.633 --> 04:34.700
CHIP: I had an old boat
that we were using
for a net-checker,

04:34.767 --> 04:37.100
and it has a leak
that's irreparable.

04:37.600 --> 04:38.767
And it just sinks.

04:38.833 --> 04:40.467
As we fill it up with more and
more salmon,

04:40.533 --> 04:42.633
it sinks lower and lower
and fills with more water.

04:42.700 --> 04:45.400
But I have a brand-new motor
coming. So I'll have
an extra motor.

04:45.467 --> 04:47.300
I'm gonna go pick the wife up
our really good fishing boat

04:47.367 --> 04:49.000
that we have over at our
son's house.

04:49.333 --> 04:53.333
It'll have real smooth sides
and my wife will fish to her
heart's delight without

04:53.400 --> 04:55.700
snagging anything while
checking net.

04:56.033 --> 04:58.300
I'll have two motors, I'll
have two boats.

05:00.133 --> 05:02.167
We've got six good fish,
seven good fish.

05:02.700 --> 05:05.233
Yep. No complaints about that.

05:05.300 --> 05:07.167
AGNES: Seven fish, awesome.

05:10.400 --> 05:11.467

ERIK SALITAN: If I don't have
any boss chewing me out.

05:16.567 --> 05:19.333
Tomorrow's Monday morning
and I don't have
to be to work.

05:28.833 --> 05:31.700
My name's Erik Salitan.
I'm a registered
guide outfitter,

05:31.767 --> 05:35.200
and I operate two lodges
in Alaska with my wife,
Martha Mae.

05:35.467 --> 05:38.267
We're gonna go ahead and
try a little bit longer
distance here

05:38.367 --> 05:41.900
and see if we can, er,
be comfortable
at a 35-yard range.

05:48.867 --> 05:49.867
Bullseye.

05:50.467 --> 05:51.967
Did I hear you say "bullseye"?

05:52.200 --> 05:54.333
-ERIK: Bullseye!
-Nice shot.

05:54.633 --> 05:56.433
Yeah. I been practising
up here.

05:56.767 --> 05:59.500
Let's see if I can't catch
me a bear with a bow.

06:00.000 --> 06:02.500
The state of Alaska's
encouraging sportsmen to
go out

06:02.567 --> 06:04.600
and harvest brown bears
and black bears,

06:04.667 --> 06:07.000
so that they don't predate
upon the moose calves.

06:07.433 --> 06:10.800
Individual bears can kill
an astonishingly large
number of moose calves

06:10.867 --> 06:14.333
in a very short period, and
that really puts a hurt
on the moose population.

06:15.600 --> 06:18.300
I'm gonna throw my stuff
together if you throw a
little food together for me.

06:18.433 --> 06:20.467
How many days? How many days'
worth of food?

06:20.533 --> 06:25.200
Oh, I'd say if I don't
catch anything, in two days
I'll come home.

06:25.433 --> 06:27.967
MARTHA MAE: What's challenging
about this hunt is that you're
not shooting

06:28.033 --> 06:30.133
with the rifle any more,
you're shooting with a bow.

06:30.333 --> 06:34.700
So you gotta get closer,
you gotta practise a lot more.
It's totally different.

06:34.767 --> 06:36.333
So you gotta be comfortable
with the bow.

06:36.400 --> 06:38.400
And confident, which is
hard to be.

06:40.867 --> 06:44.267
-The fog lifted.
-Yeah, Matt should be.

06:44.333 --> 06:46.333
Actually, it burned all
off, so.

06:46.800 --> 06:48.700
No, this is a lot nicer
than it was yesterday.

06:48.767 --> 06:51.367
I, I had seen all kinds
of planes flying around
this morning.

06:51.433 --> 06:52.500
Yeah.

06:52.567 --> 06:56.300
Let's go dump this stuff
out by the airstrip.

06:56.700 --> 06:59.467
I got some extra arrows
in my pack

06:59.733 --> 07:03.633
and got my frame pack
and a knife and a sleeping
bag. I got a tent.

07:03.733 --> 07:05.333
Here comes Matt.

07:17.700 --> 07:19.033
How was the weather on
the way over?

07:19.100 --> 07:20.533
-Beautiful.
-MARTHA MAE: Good.

07:20.600 --> 07:21.967
-Had an awesome trip.
-MARTHA MAE: Nice.

07:22.033 --> 07:23.233
MATT: So we'll load ya up
and get going.

07:27.600 --> 07:30.267
Whoa, whoa, you better be
careful with my bow now.

07:31.267 --> 07:32.833
I know how you pilots
are.

07:32.900 --> 07:34.333
All right, guys.

07:34.400 --> 07:36.400
Hopefully we'll be seeing
ya in a couple days.

07:36.533 --> 07:39.133
-All right, ya all buckled
in back there?
-I'm good to go.

07:40.733 --> 07:42.867
MARTHA MAE:
While Erik and Matt are gone
doing their hunting thing,

07:42.933 --> 07:44.867
I'm gonna hold up
the fort here.

07:45.067 --> 07:48.433
Just day-to-day chores, taking
care of fishing clients,

07:49.000 --> 07:50.900
facilitating whatever needs
to be done.

07:57.600 --> 07:59.567
JESSIE HOLMES:
This is how I go out
and relax in the summers.

07:59.633 --> 08:01.733
I go out and get prepared
for winter.

08:11.000 --> 08:15.467
All right, so fish are
here and it's time to go
catch some.

08:18.067 --> 08:19.200
I got these dogs.

08:19.267 --> 08:20.467
It's a heck of a lot better
when I got fish

08:20.533 --> 08:22.700
for 'em and I don't have
to buy dog food.

08:22.800 --> 08:26.700
NARRATOR: In Nenana, Jessie
Holmes relies on the fish
from the surrounding rivers to

08:26.767 --> 08:29.100
feed himself and his team
of sled dogs.

08:30.200 --> 08:32.533
After getting his fish wheel
into the current,

08:32.600 --> 08:34.667
Jessie must now get
the wheel operational

08:34.733 --> 08:36.700
to take advantage
of the summer chum salmon run.

08:38.867 --> 08:42.700
This is a fish wheel,
and it's used to catch
large amounts of salmon

08:42.767 --> 08:46.633
during their peak runs,
which right now, the summer
chum are in their peak run.

08:46.733 --> 08:51.067
I gotta get this big,
heavy-ass fish wheel
downriver eight feet,

08:51.300 --> 08:55.233
and then I gotta push it out
into the river about 15 feet,

08:55.500 --> 08:58.300
so I can get it to
the depth that I can drop
the baskets down.

08:59.500 --> 09:02.633
Time to get my spar log
attached here.

09:02.700 --> 09:05.933
A spar log is the log that you
anchor to the raft

09:06.400 --> 09:08.400
and you use to push the wheel
out into the current.

09:14.533 --> 09:16.300
This is a lot of work for
one man.

09:16.367 --> 09:20.167
Everything's heavy
and heavy-duty when it comes
to fish wheels, so.

09:23.200 --> 09:26.033
You gotta be in really good
physical shape to do
these things.

09:27.800 --> 09:30.467
This is anchoring the spar log
to the raft here.

09:32.700 --> 09:35.000
This fish wheel is
in pretty bad condition,
you know?

09:35.167 --> 09:38.833
But once it's dropped down
it should still work
and catch fish.

09:38.933 --> 09:43.200
But you know, not really
that safe working
on this thing.

09:46.567 --> 09:49.633
Once I get these secured
on there, I can start pushing
this fish wheel out there

09:49.700 --> 09:51.533
and then I'll be able to see
some action.

09:57.733 --> 10:01.433
Just a one-step-at-a-time
kind of thing, you know?

10:06.033 --> 10:09.133
So far I think this is going
better than ever, possibly.

10:21.433 --> 10:23.100
Ah, fuck!

10:43.133 --> 10:45.067
Hey, good to see the old
wheel running, right?

10:45.267 --> 10:46.300
(LAUGHS)

10:46.700 --> 10:51.967
I was going across and I was
gonna put a choker up on this,

10:52.133 --> 10:56.233
and start pulling it,
and the rope that I had
tied there,

10:56.600 --> 11:00.767
hanging on to a piece of wood,
that was kind of minimal
and broke.

11:00.833 --> 11:02.967
I ran off of it, no problem.

11:03.700 --> 11:05.267
This is dangerous stuff
out here.

11:05.333 --> 11:09.233
I'm just really hoping
that, you know, this
thing catches some fish.

11:12.867 --> 11:13.967
I love that sound.

11:16.767 --> 11:18.367
ERIK: If I wanted to do
something easy,

11:18.433 --> 11:20.000
I'd go live a totally
different life.

11:31.833 --> 11:33.133
MATT: Eighty degrees, Erik.

11:34.033 --> 11:36.300
ERIK: Ridiculous.
MATT: That is ridiculous.

11:36.367 --> 11:39.400
I was like holy crap, man,
I need, almost need
a T-shirt.

11:40.233 --> 11:42.067
-There's a bear.
-Where?

11:42.433 --> 11:45.167
-Oh, yeah.
-And there's a bear
on the left.

11:45.233 --> 11:46.767
-Oh yeah, a black
bear too.
-Yep.

11:46.833 --> 11:48.633
NARRATOR: In order to manage
the number of black bears

11:48.700 --> 11:51.367
and increase the moose
population in the area,

11:52.033 --> 11:54.500
Alaska Fish and Game has
issued Erik a permit

11:54.933 --> 11:57.267
that will allow him to hunt
for predator control.

12:03.867 --> 12:06.500
-Hey, good old
Notellum Creek.
-All right.

12:06.933 --> 12:09.367
ERIK: In hour one of my solo
archery bear hunt.

12:09.500 --> 12:10.667
Pretty pumped.

12:11.100 --> 12:13.233
Matt just ripped outta here.

12:13.567 --> 12:15.433
Freaking beautiful out here.

12:15.600 --> 12:17.667
I'm gonna throw up my bomb
shelter.

12:23.300 --> 12:26.433
One danger you always
wanna look out for is
that rising water.

12:26.967 --> 12:30.500
I like set my tent up right
near an escape route, away
from the channel of the river.

12:31.633 --> 12:34.633
Nothing sucks worse than
waking up and having water
running through your tent.

12:37.733 --> 12:42.200
Pretty beautiful day.
See if I can't get out there
and find me a bear.

12:42.367 --> 12:44.467
Think I'm gonna take
my sleeping bag with me

12:44.567 --> 12:46.033
in case I gotta
set up somewhere.

12:53.067 --> 12:54.300
Woo, tell you what.

12:54.367 --> 12:55.900
Here's a pretty good
brown bear track.

12:55.967 --> 12:58.100
Pretty good size bear, real
fresh.

12:59.533 --> 13:03.667
It's maybe a eight-foot brown
bear, so it's just a little
bit bigger than my hand.

13:03.733 --> 13:05.367
Already on fresh
bear sign.

13:05.433 --> 13:08.400
Predator control is
essential in Alaska.

13:09.000 --> 13:11.533
If you're an ethical and
a responsible hunter

13:11.600 --> 13:13.900
and you want to harvest moose,

13:14.200 --> 13:17.067
you should put in
the effort to harvest
animals like bears

13:17.300 --> 13:19.833
that eat those animals as
well, to keep a good
balance.

13:20.500 --> 13:23.133
I'm gonna ease my way up
this river towards those
mountains

13:23.633 --> 13:26.500
and see if I can't find
a nice place to settle in
and glass for the night.

13:39.100 --> 13:41.000
A couple miles from my
little camp I set up.

13:41.400 --> 13:43.600
It's really thick, thick
stuff in here.

13:43.867 --> 13:45.967
A bunch of bear tracks
in the soft soil.

13:46.367 --> 13:48.833
I'm gonna get up
in these rocks and set up.

13:49.000 --> 13:51.167
Just do a nice
spot-and-stalk hunt, see
if I can't wait,

13:51.433 --> 13:53.033
spot one from up high,

13:53.133 --> 13:55.567
and then sneak down
these rocks and put
the sneak on him.

13:55.733 --> 13:57.467
This looks like a prime,
prime area.

13:57.767 --> 14:00.500
Archery hunting's a lot
different than a lot of
other types of hunting.

14:00.567 --> 14:02.200
You have to get much
closer to the animal.

14:02.267 --> 14:04.200
There's a lot more skill
involved.

14:04.267 --> 14:07.500
You got to practise with a bow
a lot more than you do a rifle
to be proficient.

14:08.200 --> 14:11.900
You got a bear 150 yards,
200 yards, broadside,

14:12.000 --> 14:16.533
you have a rifle that's set
up properly, the hunt's over.
You, you got him.

14:16.733 --> 14:19.633
A well-placed arrow can kill
an animal just as efficiently

14:19.700 --> 14:21.067
if not more efficiently
than a bullet.

14:21.333 --> 14:24.733
There's bear trails
walking left and right,

14:24.833 --> 14:27.367
and up the river
and down the river,
and all through this meadow,

14:27.467 --> 14:29.300
so I'm just gonna kind of
lay up here,

14:29.733 --> 14:31.933
and I'm gonna watch all night.

14:32.033 --> 14:35.833
This is a perfect place
to find a bear coming
across an opening.

14:36.200 --> 14:40.533
I'm gonna snuggle in here
to my little er, rocky
hillside and my bivy sack,

14:40.833 --> 14:46.300
and see if I can't hold down
the fort and put the sneak on
a black bear tonight.

14:50.300 --> 14:51.767
SUE: This is mine,
that's yours.

14:51.933 --> 14:54.733
You want to cross it, we're
gonna have to have words.

15:06.333 --> 15:07.933
This is a .30-30.

15:08.000 --> 15:10.267
Am I hesitant to take a shot
on it?

15:10.333 --> 15:11.433
Absolutely.

15:12.467 --> 15:18.567
So I've got Betsy over here,
Bob's just gonna kinda have
to help me.

15:19.200 --> 15:24.700
If I have to take a shot here,
I've got a little padding
that I've put underneath

15:24.767 --> 15:27.333
and it's not gonna knock
it back.

15:27.733 --> 15:29.467
It's gonna bump it.

15:29.733 --> 15:31.900
But I've gotta get meat.

15:35.500 --> 15:38.033
NARRATOR: In order
to replenish
her winter food supply,

15:38.333 --> 15:40.633
Sue must take advantage
of the small window

15:40.700 --> 15:43.433
to hunt caribou
as they migrate
through the tundra.

15:43.900 --> 15:47.100
Maybe I'll tool down my
little road, see if I see
anything.

15:47.633 --> 15:50.533
I'll keep using my eyes,
and I'm just gonna see
what I find.

15:50.900 --> 15:54.767
I'm gonna beat myself up again
for a little while
because I hesitated.

15:56.000 --> 15:58.733
You know, I mean that's
something a virgin does
on the wedding night,

15:58.800 --> 16:02.633
that's not something somebody
in their fifties does if they
want to stay full of food.

16:08.767 --> 16:13.067
This is normally where I drop
down to get into the river.

16:18.967 --> 16:22.000
Those caribou and different
animals will take
this little highway.

16:22.600 --> 16:24.133
Where they were in the
river,

16:24.200 --> 16:26.567
this is sort of,
the natural progression

16:26.633 --> 16:29.400
for where they'd jump in
and hide from me.

16:29.533 --> 16:34.933
Okay, I can definitely see
bears been through
because it's all tore up.

16:38.533 --> 16:41.833
I can see where some
of the tracks go this way
and it looks like

16:41.900 --> 16:43.933
something has climbed
up there.

16:44.633 --> 16:47.533
So it's possible I made
the wrong choice coming down
and they went up.

16:59.700 --> 17:03.733
We're gonna be going into
the water here
in about 30 feet.

17:35.567 --> 17:36.800
(GUNSHOT)

17:40.333 --> 17:43.100
That hurt like a son
of a bitch, but I got
one down.

17:49.167 --> 17:52.667
I will not waste a single
ounce of your meat.
No way, little buddy.

17:54.033 --> 17:55.800
The pain here is just
unreal.

17:55.867 --> 17:59.333
I mean I couldn't even hold it
upright, buzzing going
all the way down here.

17:59.400 --> 18:01.500
These three fingers are
getting pretty numb,

18:01.567 --> 18:02.900
this one's getting
pretty numb.

18:03.400 --> 18:07.000
The next thing I need to do,
go get the Argo,
get over here,

18:07.067 --> 18:08.567
and take care of what I got.

18:11.367 --> 18:12.733
Hey, little girlfriend.

18:12.967 --> 18:15.400
Er, this is absolutely one
of the caribou that
I saw earlier.

18:15.467 --> 18:19.000
I have zero meat
in the coffers,

18:19.233 --> 18:23.967
so this is an absolutely
necessary step
for my own survival.

18:25.233 --> 18:31.400
This is a small cow, so you're
not gonna be busting out any,
you know,

18:31.600 --> 18:35.700
C-Note on your er, poundage.

18:37.400 --> 18:40.600
Meaning 100 pounds? No.
Fifty, sixty, maybe.

18:40.667 --> 18:43.367
Yeah, my shoulder is not
enjoying this processing
at all.

18:43.667 --> 18:48.433
This was a reality check
for me that I am not
bigger than my injury.

18:48.933 --> 18:52.233
I don't always have to be
at the top of my game,
but you know,

18:52.700 --> 18:57.867
I've always kind of said,
you know, the top of my game
is a pretty lofty height.

18:58.067 --> 19:02.700
I am constantly in a state of
learning, constantly in
a state of evaluation.

19:02.900 --> 19:06.333
Obviously I don't live
with a group of people,
so it's self-evaluation.

19:06.633 --> 19:08.367
I'm hard on myself.

19:08.500 --> 19:10.133
But I have to be.

19:10.333 --> 19:11.867
Had to be from a young age.

19:12.267 --> 19:13.933
This should hold a caribou.

19:14.000 --> 19:16.567
I get him cut up and deboned,
no problem.

19:19.867 --> 19:22.500
What I want to do is get
what I've got home.

19:22.567 --> 19:27.267
I've got meat here I need to
process and, er,
go from there.

19:28.567 --> 19:30.433
Thank you, caribou.

19:34.667 --> 19:37.567
JESSIE: It's not like it's
just one task up here. It's
multitasking all the time.

19:37.833 --> 19:39.100
Make two jobs out of one.

19:48.533 --> 19:53.733
It's turning nicely
and straight so nothing's
falling to pieces yet.

19:54.433 --> 19:56.500
I can't believe I got it
started up, you know?

19:57.500 --> 19:59.400
NARRATOR: After getting
his fish wheel
into the current,

19:59.733 --> 20:01.800
it is critical for Jessie
to make sure that it's

20:01.867 --> 20:04.667
capable of catching fish
during the summer
chum run.

20:06.900 --> 20:08.900
We just got to catch the
fish now.

20:09.267 --> 20:10.667
Fish dinner.

20:11.100 --> 20:13.867
We just need enough fish to go
cook for some dogs.

20:20.600 --> 20:21.833
Oh!

20:22.000 --> 20:24.167
I just don't wanna fucking be
here all night doing this.

20:35.367 --> 20:37.133
It's a major,
heavy thing.

20:38.267 --> 20:40.800
It's a major operation to run
one of these things.

20:40.967 --> 20:44.067
Something is always breaking
and needing fixed
and repaired.

20:45.800 --> 20:47.033
Oh, shit.

20:47.700 --> 20:50.300
The axle sleeve slipped off
of the axle.

20:52.067 --> 20:53.833
The fish are running
right now.

20:55.033 --> 20:57.133
And done a lot
of work already.

20:57.200 --> 21:01.200
Maybe after my accident there,
I'll get it down this time.

21:07.133 --> 21:09.467
CHIP: Up here you can live
in a tent and still be mayor,

21:09.533 --> 21:11.067
and people will respect
you even more.

21:24.633 --> 21:26.300
CHIP: Love you, girls.

21:26.367 --> 21:29.133
Well, we're sorry to wake you
up so early and all.
But we're out of here.

21:29.200 --> 21:31.933
We're gonna go pick up
that boat motor.
We'll be back.

21:32.000 --> 21:36.000
We're going over to Deering.
I got a brand-new motor
over there I'm gonna pick up.

21:36.067 --> 21:38.033
And er, I'm gonna put it
on this boat here,

21:38.167 --> 21:39.933
and then we have another boat
over there

21:40.033 --> 21:42.400
that we want to bring here
really badly for fishing
right here.

21:43.667 --> 21:44.700
AGNES: Love you girls.

21:45.133 --> 21:46.933
CHIP: Love you.
AGNES: You girls stay
together now.

21:47.033 --> 21:49.300
-Yep, stick together.
-And be loud.

21:49.667 --> 21:52.000
And I see the tide's
already shifted and
started going down, so

21:52.267 --> 21:53.867
the time to leave here is
pretty quick.

21:53.933 --> 21:55.667
And we want to catch a tide
to get through
our shallow lagoon.

21:59.533 --> 22:04.067
We don't really get to
Deering that often, but
erm, it's gonna be fun.

22:04.433 --> 22:06.700
We have grandkids over there
and erm, friends.

22:06.867 --> 22:10.100
We should be to Deering in
three hours probably.

22:23.800 --> 22:25.867
CHIP: My motor just
fucking died.

22:26.167 --> 22:27.767
AGNES: Your motor!

22:28.000 --> 22:30.400
CHIP: Ah, we came out of the
lagoon and I thought
that the tide being high

22:30.467 --> 22:32.867
I could go over the
sandbar, and it stopped
me dead.

22:47.933 --> 22:49.833
CHIP: Take us sideways,
would ya?

22:53.433 --> 22:55.033
CHIP: I'm changing propellers.

22:57.400 --> 22:59.767
Standard operating procedure
when we hit the ocean.

23:00.267 --> 23:02.300
You can see the difference
between the propellers.

23:03.067 --> 23:05.500
This one's been scarred,
marred, hit, and jarred.

23:05.767 --> 23:07.267
What we're out for is
efficiency,

23:07.367 --> 23:09.067
and this is the place
that I always change
my prop out.

23:09.167 --> 23:11.167
Just come right here, stop,
takes five minutes,

23:11.233 --> 23:13.200
and then I, er, I can go
a little faster.

23:14.267 --> 23:16.433
Aw, man, that thing weighs
a ton.

23:22.567 --> 23:24.500
All right, here we go.
Are you ready?

23:27.267 --> 23:28.567
Oh, yeah.

23:30.833 --> 23:32.533
A lot more power.

23:40.267 --> 23:43.400
ERIK: If I wasn't doing this
with my life, I really don't
know what I would be doing.

23:58.233 --> 24:00.100
This is a sweet spot.

24:00.167 --> 24:01.567
And I'm just gonna own this.

24:01.633 --> 24:03.833
I'm just gonna watch it,
watch it, and watch it.

24:04.400 --> 24:07.933
Bears are very predacious
on, er, little baby
moose calves,

24:08.367 --> 24:12.367
so Fish and Game is trying
to keep more meat in the woods
for all Alaskans,

24:12.833 --> 24:15.267
and, er, they've opened up
this predator control area.

24:15.867 --> 24:17.433
I'm happy to oblige
and help out.

24:17.867 --> 24:19.067
I get to enjoy this.

24:19.700 --> 24:22.800
How many people's lives do
you get to just be out in
the wild,

24:23.433 --> 24:25.867
and see things that are
painfully beautiful?

24:26.233 --> 24:30.067
I get to sit here,
up on a hill,
glassing for bears.

24:30.533 --> 24:33.500
Living out here is just,
it's awesome.

25:06.700 --> 25:08.433
That bear took off,

25:08.933 --> 25:12.133
ran through the clearing,
and it climbed up
that big birch tree.

25:13.867 --> 25:16.433
I watched these meadows
for a long, long time.

25:16.833 --> 25:19.800
I'm confident we're gonna find
that bear dead just inside
the tree line.

25:19.967 --> 25:23.600
I'm gonna ease up in there
with an arrow all knocked,
ready to rock and roll.

25:23.667 --> 25:27.933
See if we can't find ourselves
a real nice bear, black bear.

25:28.733 --> 25:31.100
NARRATOR: Erik has wounded
a black bear
with his bow and arrow.

25:31.367 --> 25:35.067
He will track the animal into
the woods to harvest the hide,

25:35.167 --> 25:38.800
but finding the animal
in the dense terrain is
a dangerous task.

25:41.833 --> 25:44.033
I'm gonna leave
my extra clothes here.

25:44.333 --> 25:48.967
I'm gonna leave my binoculars,
my rangefinder
and my sleeping bag.

25:51.333 --> 25:56.133
If you're gonna make
your living off the natural
resources of Alaska,

25:56.867 --> 25:59.133
that privilege comes
with a responsibility.

26:00.000 --> 26:04.267
It's, it's my responsibility
and every other person
who's a consumptive user

26:04.333 --> 26:07.733
of these natural
resources to manage
wildlife here in Alaska.

26:07.833 --> 26:09.933
Seems like there's a lot
of bears working this
area.

26:10.000 --> 26:12.500
I might even get another one
here before I'm outta here.

26:17.233 --> 26:20.233
SUE: If I carried around
every piece of resentment
I ever built up,

26:20.367 --> 26:22.033
I wouldn't be able to drag
it to the runway.

26:32.100 --> 26:36.833
What I'm doing, this is one
hindquarter and some of the,
some of the back strap.

26:36.900 --> 26:38.667
Er, and all's I do,
this is the heart.

26:39.333 --> 26:42.133
But for me, time is
of the essence.
Let's get it cut up.

26:42.200 --> 26:44.000
I've got a little bowl
going here.

26:44.067 --> 26:47.933
These are hocks,
this portion of your body
or your calf.

26:48.233 --> 26:51.867
But you put that again in the
crockpot or the pot on top
of the oil stove,

26:52.033 --> 26:55.300
and that cooks, cooks, cooks,
and it cooks it right down
into nothing,

26:55.367 --> 26:57.500
so then you have a tender
little pile of shredded meat.

26:57.933 --> 27:01.233
This is not tender by any
stretch of the imagination
on the hock.

27:01.600 --> 27:04.600
You know, and a lot of people
just throw it out or give it
to their dogs and say,

27:04.667 --> 27:06.800
"Oh, it's not edible,
I can't use it."

27:07.700 --> 27:10.033
And I'm like, well, yeah,
it's edible.

27:10.267 --> 27:13.267
You just have to cook
it a little differently.

27:13.667 --> 27:19.333
This is what you would
call the ham of the, er,
hindquarters.

27:19.933 --> 27:24.467
I'm just gonna cut it up into
larger sections.

27:24.567 --> 27:27.833
I follow the line
that the meat is
already giving me,

27:27.900 --> 27:30.233
the muscle structure,
and separate it.

27:30.567 --> 27:31.900
Something slimy.

27:32.733 --> 27:37.700
I am proud and happy
that I'm starting to put
something back.

27:37.900 --> 27:40.100
It's not Sue-Zero.

27:40.600 --> 27:43.700
It's Sue's got something
for her freezie right now.

27:44.233 --> 27:48.367
I can take time, make
it pretty now, but I've got
plenty of time this winter.

27:48.767 --> 27:52.233
If you look at that, yum-yum,
it's winter, right?

27:53.033 --> 27:56.000
That is a nice piece of meat.
That's a beautiful steak.

27:56.800 --> 28:00.700
I can make myself a couple
of those, and then there's
a little roast I can put in.

28:06.500 --> 28:09.367
The start, ya know, I get
a certain amount done,

28:09.933 --> 28:13.033
and then I wanna get it cooled
down and starting to freeze.

28:14.133 --> 28:18.600
Go, me! This is the, the part
where it feels good.

28:19.167 --> 28:21.533
And it feels like I'm
accomplishing something.

28:25.500 --> 28:27.667
Then I just keep chipping
away at it.

28:29.300 --> 28:31.200
I mean, it's not a lot.

28:31.867 --> 28:34.400
That's the first bit towards
my winter success.

28:36.633 --> 28:38.833
Boo-ya!
Suzie's got meat.

28:42.867 --> 28:45.000
JESSIE: I have no problem
with all the work,
but you gotta work

28:45.067 --> 28:47.067
around the clock up here
just to be prepared
for winter.

28:58.600 --> 29:00.900
The axle sleeve slipped
off of the axle.

29:06.133 --> 29:08.533
Trying to get my sleeve
back on this axle,

29:08.600 --> 29:10.567
and it's not going
very smoothly so far.

29:11.567 --> 29:14.667
Every year, I'm constantly
doing maintenance
to this thing.

29:15.633 --> 29:20.500
It's an old wheel, it's been
through hell, it's been
in the water its whole life

29:21.367 --> 29:23.400
and it's gonna go back
in the water when it's done.

29:24.300 --> 29:26.833
I'm about to have to try
to figure something
else out here.

29:31.833 --> 29:34.600
I'm gonna try to put
this spike in there and see
if I can't get it picked up,

29:34.667 --> 29:37.567
put it on a block of wood
to where I can get my sleeve
under it somehow.

29:40.267 --> 29:43.233
I went to the Tanana River
University of Fish Wheels.

29:43.300 --> 29:46.267
You gotta make the best
of what you've got and what's
at hand, you know.

29:46.633 --> 29:50.033
It's not like I'm gonna go to
a hardware store and buy
new pieces for this

29:50.100 --> 29:52.867
when it's right here,
you know, or right
on the river bank.

29:56.367 --> 29:58.833
I'm gonna try to make
a little block of wood
with a saddle in it,

29:58.933 --> 30:01.667
so if I can get this thing up
I can set it back down
on this.

30:02.000 --> 30:06.633
Some people might be liking to
be idealistic and simplistic,
but I'll tell you one thing,

30:06.700 --> 30:09.467
up in Alaska you ain't nothing
without a chainsaw.

30:11.000 --> 30:13.133
Everything I do demands
a chainsaw.

30:15.533 --> 30:18.500
I'm not sure whether this
is plan C or D.
(LAUGHS)

30:36.933 --> 30:40.700
I'm trying to time this,
'cause there's only
a certain rotation

30:40.767 --> 30:44.167
that I can get this spike
hooked on, and if it goes
past it,

30:44.233 --> 30:45.900
it just gets tight
and falls off.

30:46.033 --> 30:47.367
I'm trying to get this block
underneath there,

30:47.433 --> 30:49.433
and that'll work if I can get
it under there.

30:49.500 --> 30:51.133
Then we can get
this thing going.

30:51.200 --> 30:53.600
Kinda taking me some time
to get the timing right.

31:11.200 --> 31:12.967
Ah, fuck!

31:22.500 --> 31:25.733
Thank God for the suffering
that you catch a fish, right?

31:25.933 --> 31:28.167
That's a nice-looking chum
right there, baby.

31:28.467 --> 31:29.767
Chum money.

31:29.833 --> 31:31.700
We gotta get this thing
going right.

31:37.333 --> 31:39.667
I could go with that, but
that just won't last for
too long,

31:39.733 --> 31:41.433
I need to get it further
in there, so.

31:50.567 --> 31:51.767
Whoo!

31:52.267 --> 31:55.067
That's kinda scary business
right there.

31:55.600 --> 31:58.033
There's another fish,
so it might be working out.

31:58.500 --> 32:00.233
That's what I'm talking about,
chum money.

32:00.500 --> 32:02.200
Yeah, go right in there!

32:02.267 --> 32:04.233
That's right! Two fish.
Two fish down!

32:04.900 --> 32:06.833
I'd say for the amount
of dogs I got,

32:07.667 --> 32:11.733
once we got 17 fish in there
we'll be cooking, baby.

32:15.100 --> 32:17.233
I'm gonna have myself a
little snack, here.

32:21.700 --> 32:24.567
That's some rich
food right there.
That'll keep you going.

32:25.000 --> 32:27.200
Nice to have a little
rich snack.

32:27.700 --> 32:29.200
Straight up from the land.

32:29.267 --> 32:30.800
Can't get no better than that.

32:30.867 --> 32:33.200
Now the dogs are gonna eat,
I'm gonna eat.

32:33.733 --> 32:36.200
It's a blessing to have
this old fish wheel.

32:43.300 --> 32:46.367
CHIP: I see a lot of it around
here, where these kids learn
their natural resources.

32:46.467 --> 32:48.300
But kids elsewhere,
I don't see that.

33:03.867 --> 33:05.533
AGNES: Parking spot.
(EXCLAIMS)

33:05.867 --> 33:08.967
I would say this was a pretty
standard crossing for us.

33:09.200 --> 33:13.000
We just did about three hours
in the ocean, so not so bad.

33:14.233 --> 33:15.267
How's it go, Joe?

33:18.633 --> 33:20.300
Er, just beached my boat.

33:20.367 --> 33:22.567
My friend Joe came over
and offered us a ride.

33:22.967 --> 33:24.933
I'm gonna go into town.

33:25.000 --> 33:27.800
AGNES: It's nice to get here
and somebody's here to help
us bring our stuff up.

33:27.933 --> 33:33.167
We're gonna go look at
the boat motor, and see
the boat situation

33:33.567 --> 33:36.500
and go visit with the boy
and the grandkids.

33:36.867 --> 33:38.900
-How's it going?
-It goes, how you been?

33:38.967 --> 33:40.300
-Pretty good.
-Hi, Des.

33:41.500 --> 33:43.833
-You see us go by in the boat
and go park at the spit?
-AGNES: Hi, son.

33:45.567 --> 33:48.167
Hi, baby. Hi.

33:48.533 --> 33:50.400
I brought a gallon of resin
to finish this off.

33:50.633 --> 33:53.300
First layer of resin's dry,
just have to set
and do it again.

33:53.367 --> 33:54.900
Oh, yeah.

33:55.233 --> 33:57.733
If we get some paper onto
those sanders and get
an extension cord out here,

33:58.033 --> 34:00.500
we could get this all done
by tonight. If I start here
in a little while,

34:00.567 --> 34:02.233
then I'll have the rest
of the day free to go visit.

34:05.233 --> 34:06.867
Oh, wow, when did this
get here?

34:07.233 --> 34:09.133
Just got in the other day,
or a couple days ago.

34:09.600 --> 34:12.600
Well, we'll work on this boat
here and bring our 20-horse
to this boat,

34:12.733 --> 34:16.500
launch it, and go park it
at the spit when we're done
with this, fixing this one.

34:16.867 --> 34:19.767
Well, for us you know, it's,
er, having two boats is
always better than one.

34:19.833 --> 34:21.267
Just like having
two snow machines.

34:21.433 --> 34:23.800
When one's down, you got
the other one to back
yourself up with.

34:24.300 --> 34:25.900
When my wife is fishing
with that one,

34:25.967 --> 34:27.567
I can be off hunting
and wood-gathering
with the other one.

34:27.700 --> 34:30.467
I'll be safer out here in the
ocean, and she'll have an
easier time

34:30.533 --> 34:33.333
pulling a net over the side
with a smooth-sided boat
with no rivets and no seats

34:33.400 --> 34:34.533
and none of that stuff.

34:39.200 --> 34:40.433
I'm smoothing this up.

34:40.633 --> 34:42.833
I'm using this sander
right now to erm,

34:42.900 --> 34:45.433
get all the lumps and bumps
and high points that were left

34:45.500 --> 34:47.567
when the, erm, this keel
got rebuilt.

34:56.267 --> 34:58.667
So the next step
in the process is adding
the, erm, hardener.

34:59.000 --> 35:01.467
I'm just doing a resin,
a resin-over.

35:01.533 --> 35:03.167
It's already been
fibreglassed.

35:03.333 --> 35:06.133
Basically I'm taking and I'm
putting another coating
of resin.

35:07.100 --> 35:11.367
And I just wanna seal
everything up. I wanna make
sure it's all gone over.

35:11.867 --> 35:13.433
It's all been proofed.

35:13.800 --> 35:15.800
It's kind of like
a final paint job.

35:16.533 --> 35:17.967
Final waterproofing.

35:20.800 --> 35:23.600
I treat all boats as if I want
them to float for forever,

35:23.667 --> 35:26.167
because I'm gonna put
my kids in 'em and stuff,

35:26.467 --> 35:28.400
so I try to make sure
that they're in tune
all right.

35:29.367 --> 35:31.333
This boat's got a lot of great
memories, a lot of adventures.

35:32.467 --> 35:34.933
Lot of crazy shit,
lot of stuff with my kids.

35:35.167 --> 35:37.167
I look forward to seeing
this thing in action again.

35:40.567 --> 35:43.600
That should about do it.
That's the end of it.

35:45.033 --> 35:46.967
I'm gonna let this dry
for a couple hours.

35:47.033 --> 35:49.333
And we'll let it go
from there.

35:50.333 --> 35:51.333
It's all good to me.

35:55.833 --> 35:58.467
ERIK: Natural resources are
key to my life
as a subsistence user.

35:59.100 --> 36:01.200
They're also key to me
as a commercial operator.

36:08.167 --> 36:13.300
I'm here at the spot
where I shot the bear, where
he was actually standing.

36:13.367 --> 36:16.100
You can see the vegetation's
all knocked down here.

36:16.300 --> 36:20.200
I gotta go into some pretty
thick, nasty stuff here to try
and find him.

36:20.433 --> 36:22.500
Ditch my pack here for two
reasons.

36:22.833 --> 36:26.733
One is I don't wanna get hung
up in case I gotta do
something that's a little bit,

36:27.267 --> 36:28.933
little bit rowdy in there.

36:29.000 --> 36:32.600
The other reason is this'll
let me remember exactly
where the bear was.

36:32.667 --> 36:35.867
If I get screwed up tracking
and I'm circling and I get
all kinds of lost

36:35.933 --> 36:39.800
and screwed up, come back to
this pack and I can
start all over.

36:42.333 --> 36:44.067
That bear cut right
through here.

36:44.867 --> 36:47.467
And then it climbed up
one of these birch trees.

36:47.833 --> 36:51.367
And it was making a wild
racket, it went 30, 40 foot up
the birch.

36:51.633 --> 36:53.933
It's one of these two trees
right here.

36:54.000 --> 36:55.600
Not exactly sure,

36:55.833 --> 36:58.267
but I'm willing to bet
when I get over there I'm
gonna see some sign of it.

36:58.833 --> 37:00.567
Let's see if we can't sneak up
in there.

37:01.300 --> 37:03.200
We're stepping into
another world here.

37:03.800 --> 37:05.900
This isn't bright and sunny
and hot,

37:07.033 --> 37:09.467
this is shady and full
of shadows.

37:10.000 --> 37:11.967
This is the world of the
bears.

37:12.033 --> 37:15.967
A whole understory
of this forest here is
these ferns.

37:16.500 --> 37:18.867
I'm 6'4" and they're
waist-deep on me.

37:19.633 --> 37:21.367
Which means that bear,
dead or alive,

37:22.133 --> 37:23.867
you're not gonna see him
till you step on him.

37:28.067 --> 37:30.067
That's the tree that bear
climbed.

37:30.567 --> 37:33.267
You can see the blood
on the base of that
birch right there.

37:33.333 --> 37:34.933
I heard him come down.

37:36.867 --> 37:39.267
Crash, a little bit,
then I didn't hear nothin'.

37:39.667 --> 37:41.700
I'm hoping that bear's
dead right up in here.

37:54.167 --> 37:55.167
(WHISPERING)

38:12.000 --> 38:14.533
Pretty dead to me.
He's gone.

38:14.767 --> 38:17.700
That concludes my first
solo archery bear hunt.

38:18.367 --> 38:20.167
Got a dead black
bear here.

38:20.333 --> 38:24.533
One clean shot, kept it
under 25 yards,
good ethical range.

38:24.600 --> 38:27.633
Did the moose a favour here
in this predator control unit.

38:28.100 --> 38:31.400
You know, I was able to get
this bear,

38:31.467 --> 38:32.833
have a little bit more, er,

38:34.167 --> 38:38.533
little bit more meat running
around in the woods for all
Alaskans, and life is good.

38:46.700 --> 38:48.233
My bear here.

38:48.500 --> 38:52.233
Got my pack.
I'm pretty pumped,
this was a successful hunt.

38:53.300 --> 38:55.300
Little worn out, ready to
head home,

38:56.033 --> 39:00.933
eat some good food Martha'll
make for me, and, er,
get out of here.

39:03.800 --> 39:05.400
I enjoy just a little
quiet time.

39:05.600 --> 39:07.667
It lets me, er, reflect
on things.

39:07.733 --> 39:09.633
You know, a good way to
regroup, refocus,

39:09.700 --> 39:12.867
be a good husband, be
a good business owner,
a good operator,

39:12.933 --> 39:14.633
and keep moving forward.

39:14.767 --> 39:17.700
So the harvest of this bear
may have saved a large number
of moose.

39:18.000 --> 39:20.033
It's a positive thing for
my psyche overall.

39:23.400 --> 39:25.133
CHIP: If you're gonna work,
you can do it smiling
or crying,

39:25.200 --> 39:26.333
but you're gonna work.

39:35.533 --> 39:37.333
Boat here's about 800
pounds, total.

39:37.500 --> 39:40.133
And the three of us, to move
it to the beach, is gonna be
quite a struggle.

39:40.200 --> 39:44.700
Er, basically what I'm gonna
do next is go over, get some
wood, get my son to help me.

39:44.933 --> 39:47.367
We're gonna go put them down
as rollers, and we're gonna
roll this

39:47.500 --> 39:48.967
boat right down to the beach.

39:49.400 --> 39:51.933
We'll stop, we'll put the
engine on, we'll push it
in the rest of the way,

39:52.000 --> 39:54.133
we'll start it up and, er,
go park it in the harbour
over there.

40:05.633 --> 40:07.667
Okay. Stop, stop, stop!

40:07.767 --> 40:11.267
Every few feet we gotta
move this thing, we gotta
reposition our logs.

40:12.533 --> 40:14.033
(GRUNTING) All right.
There we go.

40:28.100 --> 40:29.933
We're almost there.

40:31.767 --> 40:34.067
Right there, right there,
right there, right there.

40:37.500 --> 40:39.467
One, two, three, go.

40:57.933 --> 41:00.000
Ah, we're just getting
the motor fixed.

41:06.300 --> 41:09.500
Yeah, you'll meet me down
at the, at the other boat with
the 60-horse.

41:11.667 --> 41:12.667
Thanks!

41:18.367 --> 41:20.267
The boat is awesome.

41:20.333 --> 41:22.600
The boat'll do the job the way
it's done before and it's
intended to do soon.

41:27.267 --> 41:29.167
All the repairs seem to
have turned out well.

41:29.267 --> 41:31.367
Everything seems to have
turned out well.
No complaints.

41:31.433 --> 41:33.133
The only water in the boat is
what splashed over the back

41:33.200 --> 41:34.267
while we were getting out
of the waves.

41:34.633 --> 41:36.633
Good, look like son's coming
here with the motor.

41:36.967 --> 41:38.433
AGNES: Just in time.

41:50.700 --> 41:53.300
I'm getting this motor mounted
on with Doug here,

41:53.367 --> 41:54.533
and we're almost done.

41:56.900 --> 41:58.600
Pretty cool, huh?

42:02.400 --> 42:06.033
We'll go test it and son,
you'll watch us and make sure
we're okay and come back yeah?

42:07.400 --> 42:09.967
Either that or at least be
laughing as we drown.

42:12.400 --> 42:14.300
Wow, it goes backwards!

42:16.733 --> 42:18.933
Feels powerful.

42:19.000 --> 42:20.200
Wow, power?

42:20.267 --> 42:21.467
Power.

42:22.600 --> 42:25.300
Usually we don't even try
to go out in big waves,

42:25.367 --> 42:28.700
but with a bigger motor
and more power, we should
be able to do this.

42:30.500 --> 42:31.500
(AGNES EXCLAIMS)

42:32.200 --> 42:34.233
Everything at your control,
with your thumb?

42:34.300 --> 42:36.033
Yeah. I like it.
I'm impressed.

42:36.100 --> 42:38.500
(EXCLAIMS) We got
a brand new boat motor.

42:39.067 --> 42:40.533
I'm so happy.

42:40.800 --> 42:43.700
We also got this Boston Whaler
net-checker...

42:43.800 --> 42:45.500
-Revived.
-...revived.

42:45.567 --> 42:47.200
CHIP: Well I came to Deering
in one boat,

42:47.267 --> 42:49.467
and I'm leaving with two
'cause I came to Deering
to pick up a new motor.

42:49.533 --> 42:53.033
Since I got a spare motor,
with a new motor on here,
I can't run two of 'em,

42:53.100 --> 42:55.200
we decided that we needed
to revive an old fishing boat.

42:55.667 --> 42:58.033
So, erm, my wife was
really needing a fishing
boat anyway

42:58.100 --> 42:59.367
and it worked out pretty well.

42:59.433 --> 43:00.833
Nothing but the best.

43:01.367 --> 43:02.733
AGNES: Thank you.
CHIP: Yeah.
