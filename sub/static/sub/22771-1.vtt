02:50.003 --> 02:51.038
<i>Death of a legend.</i>

02:52.438 --> 02:54.577
<i>It is with sorrow that the country learned...</i>

02:54.741 --> 02:58.245
<i>...this week of the death
of Aristide Leonides.</i>

02:58.444 --> 03:04.691
<i>Born in 1871, he arrived from Greece
aged 23 without a penny in his pocket...</i>

03:04.851 --> 03:07.661
<i>...and opened his first restaurant
that same year.</i>

03:07.820 --> 03:11.029
<i>The first hotel was ready
for business not long after.</i>

03:11.191 --> 03:14.695
<i>His first wife,
Lady Marcia de Haviland, died young.</i>

03:14.861 --> 03:17.740
<i>But Mr. Leonides wasn't alone at the end.</i>

03:17.897 --> 03:22.278
<i>He is survived by his young
and lovely American widow, Brenda.</i>

03:22.468 --> 03:26.177
<i>Here is Mr. Leonides
with his eldest granddaughter, Sophia.</i>

03:26.506 --> 03:29.612
<i>Friend or foe, no one could dispute...</i>

03:29.776 --> 03:32.780
<i>...Aristide Leonides was a colossus
of his time.</i>

03:39.185 --> 03:41.597
- Good morning, Miss Ackroyd.
- Good morning, Mr. Hayward.

03:41.754 --> 03:42.892
- Mr. Hayward.
- Yes?

03:43.056 --> 03:45.935
We have a client. She's waiting inside.

03:46.092 --> 03:49.039
- She?
- Wouldn't give a name.

03:50.029 --> 03:51.565
Hello.

03:54.067 --> 03:55.512
Hello, Charles.

04:25.331 --> 04:29.040
I'm sorry to surprise you like this,
but I wasn't sure you'd agree to see me.

04:29.936 --> 04:33.475
I'm really very sorry to hear your news...

04:34.140 --> 04:36.017
...Miss Leonides.

04:36.175 --> 04:38.781
I wanted to be incognito in Egypt.

04:38.945 --> 04:42.256
I was surprised
when you left the diplomatic...

04:43.116 --> 04:45.460
- ...for this.
- Detection?

04:45.618 --> 04:47.188
It's a family business.

04:47.353 --> 04:49.765
What exactly can I do for you, Sophia?

04:50.790 --> 04:52.997
I believe my grandfather was murdered.

04:54.093 --> 04:55.163
Murdered?

04:55.328 --> 04:58.798
He died of a heart attack,
but I suspect foul play.

04:58.965 --> 05:00.774
And what makes you suspect that?

05:00.933 --> 05:02.572
I found him.

05:02.969 --> 05:06.883
And the doctor was acting oddly,
and he wouldn't sign the death certificate.

05:07.073 --> 05:08.848
And there's going to be a postmortem.

05:10.143 --> 05:13.613
- Right.
- I want you, Charles...

05:13.780 --> 05:17.660
...to come down to the house and look
into it before the police get involved.

05:18.184 --> 05:19.493
For a fee, of course.

05:20.653 --> 05:24.032
It'd be a little unethical for me
to take this case, Sophia.

05:24.190 --> 05:27.729
- I'm sure you can understand that.
- You want to know why I left?

05:28.227 --> 05:29.570
- No. I...
- I didn't want you...

05:29.729 --> 05:32.539
- ...to become involved with my family.
- The penniless junior diplomat...

05:32.699 --> 05:34.474
...not what they had in mind
for you, is that it?

05:34.634 --> 05:36.978
- Don't...
- Now you do want me involved?

05:37.136 --> 05:39.343
Now things are different,
very different indeed.

05:39.505 --> 05:40.848
Not for me.

05:42.608 --> 05:45.248
I believe the killer may still be
in the house.

05:48.181 --> 05:50.127
I'm frightened, Charles.

05:50.683 --> 05:52.253
You, frightened?

05:52.752 --> 05:54.391
Yes.

05:54.554 --> 05:56.932
Well, then you should go straight
to the police.

05:57.990 --> 06:00.937
Miss Ackroyd,
Miss Leonides will be leaving now.

06:11.738 --> 06:13.945
You should at least think about it.

06:30.022 --> 06:31.592
Miss Leonides.

06:31.758 --> 06:33.294
You've met her before?

06:33.459 --> 06:36.372
- Briefly, in Cairo.
- Oh, come on, Mr. Hayward.

06:36.529 --> 06:39.271
Just think of the publicity.

06:39.432 --> 06:42.709
You can't afford to refuse this job.

06:43.569 --> 06:47.881
What exactly is your interest
in the Leonides death, Charles?

06:48.040 --> 06:50.919
I've been approached
by a member of the family.

06:51.077 --> 06:54.581
I don't know what you think you're playing
at with this gumshoe business.

06:54.747 --> 06:57.057
You should be here at the Yard,
like your father.

06:57.216 --> 06:59.719
- A hard act to follow.
- You can say that again.

06:59.886 --> 07:00.990
What do you want?

07:01.788 --> 07:06.100
The examining doctor noticed
the extreme contractions of the pupils.

07:06.259 --> 07:11.174
He ran some tests and concluded
the cause of his death was eserine.

07:11.330 --> 07:14.607
- It's...
- Also known as physostigmine.

07:14.767 --> 07:17.612
Used in eye drops to treat glaucoma...

07:18.070 --> 07:22.644
...or, if injected directly
into the bloodstream...

07:23.142 --> 07:25.122
...would cause a heart attack.

07:25.778 --> 07:28.088
Your father used to lean forward like that.

07:31.417 --> 07:36.628
Leonides was a diabetic. It's possible
the eserine was switched with his insulin.

07:36.789 --> 07:38.701
- Were the eye drops his?
- Yes.

07:38.858 --> 07:41.498
So the switch could have
just been an accident.

07:41.661 --> 07:43.664
Could have been. There's not much of a case.

07:43.830 --> 07:47.437
And the family lawyers would
tear us apart if we tried to make one.

07:47.600 --> 07:48.635
What about the press?

07:48.801 --> 07:51.839
Once the Yard breathes "murder,"
the press will be all over it.

07:52.004 --> 07:56.316
And these people relish their privacy
as much as they relish their money.

07:57.877 --> 08:01.518
This member of the family, he or she?

08:01.681 --> 08:03.285
She.

08:03.449 --> 08:04.621
Above suspicion?

08:07.954 --> 08:10.366
All right. Two days.
Then I call in the hounds.

08:10.523 --> 08:13.060
Look, I haven't decided to take the case yet.

08:13.259 --> 08:14.568
Then what are you doing here?

08:14.760 --> 08:17.866
I don't see why a family
like this would talk to me.

08:18.030 --> 08:20.636
Open the gates even.
I have no authority. I...

08:20.800 --> 08:23.542
Leonides had a lot of powerful friends.

08:23.703 --> 08:25.205
He also had powerful enemies.

08:25.972 --> 08:28.885
He was a controversial figure.

08:30.676 --> 08:34.089
Take all these notes to your office,
think about it.

08:34.647 --> 08:36.785
<i>Wait for my call.</i>

08:57.603 --> 08:59.446
Thank you, Charles.

09:01.240 --> 09:02.947
For what?

09:04.710 --> 09:06.690
For taking me dancing tonight.

09:26.332 --> 09:27.578
Charles Hayward.

10:32.531 --> 10:34.443
Is everything all right?

10:35.001 --> 10:36.981
Do you know anything about moles?

10:37.136 --> 10:39.844
No. I'm afraid not.

10:40.006 --> 10:43.476
I have an arsenal of other weapons,
of course, traps, poisons.

10:43.643 --> 10:47.523
Sometimes I use holly. It pricks them,
do you see? Makes them bleed.

10:47.680 --> 10:52.129
Moles are hemophiliacs. Little bleeders.
Like some European royals.

10:52.284 --> 10:55.925
Though I do find a shotgun
best expresses my feelings.

10:56.989 --> 10:58.969
Are you Sophia's sleuth?

10:59.125 --> 11:01.799
Yes. Charles Hayward.

11:01.961 --> 11:05.534
- I'm sorry, the gates were open.
- Yes, we were expecting you.

11:05.698 --> 11:07.041
Edith de Haviland.

11:07.199 --> 11:10.408
My late sister was Aristide's first wife.

11:10.569 --> 11:14.915
Sophia believes there's a Borgia
living under this roof.

11:15.074 --> 11:16.553
How dramatic.

11:16.709 --> 11:17.813
Josephine!

11:20.379 --> 11:22.256
Josephine!

11:23.582 --> 11:26.529
- Josephine!
- Josephine, Nanny's calling you.

11:26.686 --> 11:29.667
- Come along.
- All right, Aunt Edith!

11:30.556 --> 11:32.468
Come along now, there's a good girl.

11:35.061 --> 11:36.597
Come on.

11:36.762 --> 11:37.832
Get off of me.

11:39.331 --> 11:40.435
Go on.

11:40.599 --> 11:44.206
I don't know what we'd do
without our old nannies.

11:44.370 --> 11:45.906
Faithful.

11:46.072 --> 11:48.780
I chose this one myself years ago.

11:48.974 --> 11:50.112
Hello, Charles.

11:51.377 --> 11:52.856
Sophia.

11:53.179 --> 11:55.421
How do you two know one another?

11:55.581 --> 11:58.687
We met in Egypt,
when I was out there with Sotheby's.

11:58.851 --> 12:01.730
He saved my life. Didn't you, Charles?

12:01.887 --> 12:05.630
Well, her horse bolted on the way
to the pyramids. I managed to stop it.

12:08.494 --> 12:09.768
I'm sorry?

12:09.929 --> 12:13.377
Sophia has never been
run away with in her life.

12:13.532 --> 12:16.741
By a horse or anything else, come to that.

12:16.902 --> 12:21.715
- Charles likes to think he rescued me.
- Oh, the dear boy.

12:34.587 --> 12:37.158
Aunt Edith came to nurse Grandmama...

12:37.323 --> 12:41.294
...and when she died, considered it
her duty to help bring up the boys.

12:41.627 --> 12:44.574
Save them from Grandpapa's influence.

12:44.730 --> 12:48.143
They fought like cat and dog,
Aunt Edith and Grandpapa.

12:48.300 --> 12:51.406
She told him he was a slimy foreigner
with his fingers in the till.

12:51.570 --> 12:54.949
And he told her she was
a narrow-minded, xenophobic snob.

12:56.175 --> 12:59.179
Actually, I think she secretly adored him.

13:01.180 --> 13:03.490
Here's the man himself.

13:03.649 --> 13:06.858
I know what you're thinking.
The gorgeous daughter of an earl...

13:07.052 --> 13:10.830
...and a near midget immigrant,
an unlikely match.

13:10.990 --> 13:12.526
But Granny fell for him.

13:12.691 --> 13:16.161
There was something exotic and vibrant
about him that appealed to her.

13:16.328 --> 13:18.865
- Was the marriage happy?
- Very happy.

13:19.064 --> 13:23.604
Of course, their respective friends didn't
mix, and her parents couldn't stand him.

13:23.769 --> 13:25.976
Well, then why didn't they stop it?

13:26.305 --> 13:28.512
Nobody could stop Grandpapa, Charles.

13:39.852 --> 13:42.731
This is where you found him?
Can you walk me through it?

13:44.156 --> 13:46.534
I brought him up breakfast.

13:46.692 --> 13:49.195
Was that usual?

13:49.962 --> 13:51.464
<i>Yes.</i>

13:51.997 --> 13:53.135
Morning, Grandpapa.

13:53.299 --> 13:55.211
He liked me to do it.

13:55.367 --> 13:56.812
And why was that?

13:58.604 --> 14:01.744
We had a special bond.

14:01.907 --> 14:03.409
Grandpapa?

14:08.013 --> 14:09.890
<i>Special bond? How do you mean?</i>

14:10.382 --> 14:11.691
Nothing.

14:11.851 --> 14:14.764
We just got along well, that's all.

14:14.920 --> 14:17.127
This was his bathroom.

14:19.925 --> 14:22.405
And that's the fatal cupboard.

14:22.828 --> 14:25.399
- And through there?
- His wife's room.

14:25.564 --> 14:27.840
- Brenda.
- Yes.

14:30.135 --> 14:32.638
In my office, you said...

14:33.639 --> 14:36.347
Well, you said you were frightened.

14:38.077 --> 14:41.024
We're a very odd family, Charles.

14:41.580 --> 14:47.360
There's lots of ruthlessness in us
and different kinds of ruthlessness.

14:47.753 --> 14:51.724
That's what's so disturbing.
The different kinds.

14:53.359 --> 14:55.430
- What do you mean?
- Exactly what I said.

14:56.028 --> 14:58.201
If you need anything,
you know where to find me.

14:58.364 --> 15:00.241
Yes, thank you, Sophia.

15:21.453 --> 15:23.433
Are you the detective?

15:25.057 --> 15:27.765
You must be Josephine, Sophia's sister.

15:27.927 --> 15:30.669
- How do you do?
- I'm very well, thank you.

15:30.829 --> 15:32.433
So you find out people's secrets?

15:32.598 --> 15:34.703
That's the idea.

15:35.634 --> 15:38.444
- Is that your tree house out there?
- Mine and Eustace's.

15:38.604 --> 15:39.639
He's my older brother.

15:41.273 --> 15:42.684
I like your notebook.

15:42.841 --> 15:45.321
- What do you write in it?
- The things that I know.

15:45.477 --> 15:46.854
I know lots of things.

15:47.012 --> 15:50.960
And now that my grandpa's dead, I am
by far the cleverest person in this house.

15:51.116 --> 15:52.595
Anything you'd like to tell me?

15:52.751 --> 15:56.164
Not yet. You see, I read detective stories.

15:56.322 --> 15:58.962
And a good detective will take time
to gather evidence...

15:59.124 --> 16:01.604
...and question everyone
before solving a case.

16:01.760 --> 16:04.639
The murderer is never the one
you initially suspect.

16:04.797 --> 16:07.334
- Magda is ready for you now.
- Magda?

16:07.499 --> 16:10.776
She doesn't like me calling her "Mommy."
She says it ages her.

16:12.538 --> 16:16.145
There's no place like home.

16:16.308 --> 16:18.379
Oh, these shoes are all wrong.

16:18.544 --> 16:20.615
Much too frivolous for the occasion.

16:20.779 --> 16:23.157
- I apologize, Mr. Hayward.
- No.

16:23.315 --> 16:25.352
Oh, God...

16:25.517 --> 16:27.963
...I drank far too much claret last night.

16:28.120 --> 16:31.568
It gives me headaches.
Burgundy suits me so much better.

16:31.757 --> 16:33.828
Perhaps you should take an aspirin.

16:33.993 --> 16:35.302
Aspirin?

16:36.829 --> 16:39.708
- Hair of the dog, darling.
- Yeah.

16:39.865 --> 16:42.778
Cure evil with evil.

16:46.972 --> 16:49.009
And what about you?

16:49.174 --> 16:53.088
- It's a little early for me, I think.
- You're cute.

16:54.313 --> 16:57.294
Wait till you have three children.

16:58.384 --> 17:01.559
So you're an actress?

17:01.720 --> 17:05.259
Clearly, you've never set foot in a theater,
otherwise you'd know my work.

17:05.424 --> 17:08.530
I must admit I am more
of a cinema enthusiast.

17:08.694 --> 17:09.866
I see.

17:10.229 --> 17:12.505
Never cared much for the movies myself.

17:13.499 --> 17:16.537
Although, I do have a superb script.

17:16.702 --> 17:18.409
My husband wrote it for me.

17:18.569 --> 17:22.518
<i>Exposure.</i> His first work of fiction.
Full of passion.

17:22.674 --> 17:25.051
The lead character, <i>moi...</i>

17:25.210 --> 17:27.690
...is a wonderfully dark part.

17:27.846 --> 17:31.419
I know they say I should always play
comedy because of my nose, but...

17:32.384 --> 17:37.527
Well, I suppose this murder would give us
a lot of advance publicity and...

17:42.428 --> 17:46.103
- Do go on.
- Is any of this really of any importance?

17:46.265 --> 17:48.711
I mean, after all,
we have our very own Ruth Ellis...

17:48.867 --> 17:51.040
...right under this roof.

17:51.203 --> 17:53.479
Ruth Ellis shot her lover...

17:53.972 --> 17:57.886
- ...not her husband.
- Well, either way, she was hanged for it.

17:58.043 --> 17:59.283
And rightly so.

17:59.445 --> 18:04.053
But are you... Are you saying you'd like
to see Brenda Leonides hanged?

18:04.216 --> 18:07.891
You are twisting my words.

18:09.888 --> 18:13.427
Yes, well... Perhaps I should have
a word with your husband?

18:13.592 --> 18:16.596
- He's in the library.
- Thank you so much for your time.

18:17.062 --> 18:20.066
- Is that all?
- For today, yes.

18:20.232 --> 18:23.645
Good. I'm starving.

18:26.605 --> 18:28.107
I hope I'm not interrupting.

18:28.273 --> 18:32.483
Charles, let me introduce you
to my father, Philip Leonides.

18:32.644 --> 18:35.625
It is a pleasure to meet you, sir.
Charles Hayward.

18:35.781 --> 18:37.021
I knew a Hayward once.

18:37.182 --> 18:40.652
Assistant commissioner
of Scotland Yard. A legend in the force.

18:40.819 --> 18:42.298
My father.

18:42.454 --> 18:46.197
Did rather well for himself,
until he was murdered.

18:46.758 --> 18:49.329
- And they never found out who did it?
- No.

18:49.495 --> 18:51.407
- Not much of a recommendation.
- Father.

18:51.930 --> 18:54.172
Mr. Leonides...

18:57.002 --> 18:59.482
As disagreeable
as you may find my visit to be...

18:59.638 --> 19:03.643
...I can guarantee that it will pale
in comparison to what's in store for you...

19:03.809 --> 19:05.880
...should the police decide to come again.

19:06.044 --> 19:09.457
Can you make an effort now, please? For me?

19:09.615 --> 19:11.288
Seems my lovely Sophia is upset.

19:11.450 --> 19:15.626
We must reach some sort of
accommodation, Mr. Hayward.

19:15.988 --> 19:18.491
Are you suggesting
that we let the roll of a die...

19:18.657 --> 19:19.863
...decide for us?

19:20.025 --> 19:23.234
It will determine whether or not
we continue this conversation.

19:23.428 --> 19:25.135
- Pick a number.
- Will you two stop...

19:25.297 --> 19:28.073
- Mr. Leonides, please...
- I'll assign you "four."

19:28.233 --> 19:30.543
Of course, the odds are against you.

19:33.539 --> 19:38.250
- I'm not gonna answer your questions.
- Well, that would be very bad form, sir.

19:38.443 --> 19:41.185
You think pressure
from some little man at Scotland Yard...

19:41.346 --> 19:45.556
- ...is going to make me talk to you?
- I do. Yes.

19:46.585 --> 19:51.034
Because that little man and I
are trying to do you a favor, sir.

19:56.461 --> 19:58.373
The little notebook. Of course.

19:58.530 --> 20:00.874
- Jot away.
- You are the eldest son.

20:01.033 --> 20:02.774
I am.

20:03.969 --> 20:05.278
How long have you lived here?

20:05.470 --> 20:08.280
Ten years ago, I lost a poker game
to the wrong people.

20:08.774 --> 20:12.119
My father used it as an opportunity
to keep me on a leash.

20:12.277 --> 20:15.781
That's what drove us here,
along with one or two bombs.

20:15.981 --> 20:19.360
My father is referring to some
of my mother's plays, which were...

20:19.518 --> 20:23.022
- ...less than successful.
- Yes. So you wrote her a screenplay.

20:23.522 --> 20:24.728
I am an historian.

20:24.890 --> 20:27.370
I write on medieval art and literature.

20:27.526 --> 20:32.305
This screenplay of my wife's was...
Is a one-off.

20:32.497 --> 20:34.272
She and I live for the arts.

20:34.433 --> 20:38.245
So you play no part
in your father's business operations?

20:38.403 --> 20:42.374
Uncle Roger runs Associated Catering,
my grandfather's flagship company.

20:42.541 --> 20:45.044
Yes, my little brother is the man...

20:45.210 --> 20:47.816
...despite having the business sense
of a mongoose.

20:49.581 --> 20:53.620
But you are not in actual need of...

20:54.519 --> 20:55.554
Money?

20:55.721 --> 20:58.327
No one in this house is
in actual need of money.

20:58.523 --> 21:00.901
Why on earth would you stay here?

21:01.059 --> 21:03.164
Because that was the deal.

21:03.328 --> 21:08.277
Besides, who actually wants to work
for a living, Mr. Hayward?

21:09.801 --> 21:11.178
Has the will been read?

21:11.336 --> 21:13.441
Not yet. Why?

21:13.605 --> 21:15.482
I'd have expected it by now, that's all.

21:15.641 --> 21:19.748
Everyone knows what's in it.
I mean, we're all very well provided for.

21:19.911 --> 21:22.756
So no little clues for you there,
Mr. Hayward.

21:22.914 --> 21:25.417
Thank you, Mr. Leonides.

21:27.819 --> 21:29.298
Yes, one last thing.

21:29.454 --> 21:30.592
If you must.

21:30.756 --> 21:33.601
- You don't seem at all sad, sir.
- I beg your pardon?

21:33.759 --> 21:36.069
Your father is dead.

21:37.362 --> 21:39.205
You don't seem remotely sad about it.

21:39.765 --> 21:42.439
Goodbye, Mr. Hayward.

22:03.522 --> 22:07.561
A little man, Mr. Hayward,
who cast a large shadow.

22:07.726 --> 22:10.366
A very large and rather crooked shadow.

22:14.299 --> 22:17.803
- What are you doing?
- Can't I play detective too?

22:18.370 --> 22:20.043
You smell of cigar...

22:20.205 --> 22:22.151
...which means you've met Philip.

22:22.307 --> 22:25.516
But you don't smell of alcohol.
Is Magda still asleep?

22:25.677 --> 22:28.180
No. I met her.

22:28.347 --> 22:31.351
So you actually declined
the drink she offered you.

22:31.516 --> 22:34.053
Good boy. Keeping a clear head.

22:34.219 --> 22:36.324
Eyes on the prize.

22:36.488 --> 22:39.128
No wonder Sophia likes you.

22:40.125 --> 22:41.331
Lady Edith...

22:41.493 --> 22:44.440
- ...when might be a good time to talk?
- Oh, I'm busy.

22:44.629 --> 22:46.268
Autumnal pruning.

22:46.431 --> 22:49.901
I'm a firm believer in the benefits
of deadheading.

22:50.068 --> 22:51.741
In all seasons.

23:20.399 --> 23:22.140
Clemency Leonides.

23:22.300 --> 23:24.303
Do feel free to come and go as you please.

23:24.469 --> 23:26.949
I'm sorry, the door was open.

23:27.105 --> 23:30.416
You're the private detective
Sophia hired, I suppose.

23:30.809 --> 23:32.550
Charles Hayward.

23:33.178 --> 23:34.782
Continuing our theme of openness...

23:34.946 --> 23:39.759
...perhaps you should be aware that I am
a senior research chemist at La Roche.

23:39.918 --> 23:43.127
- And...
- And my specialty is plant toxicology...

23:43.288 --> 23:44.426
...Mr. Hayward.

23:44.589 --> 23:47.468
I know all there is to know about poisons.

23:48.093 --> 23:51.233
I don't suppose you ever bring
your work home with you, now?

23:52.597 --> 23:54.440
Roger!

23:54.933 --> 23:57.778
Sophia's detective is here.

23:57.936 --> 23:59.415
So tell me, how does it work?

23:59.571 --> 24:01.778
All of you living in this house together?

24:01.940 --> 24:04.113
Who told you it works?

24:05.076 --> 24:06.146
Mr. Hayward.

24:06.311 --> 24:09.622
- Aunt Edith tells me you know Sophia.
- Yes, we knew each other briefly.

24:09.781 --> 24:12.990
- In Cairo.
- No, no, we think that's good, don't we?

24:13.151 --> 24:16.030
- Anything to help lock this slut away.
- Darling.

24:16.221 --> 24:20.260
I can't believe she couldn't wait. He was 86
and she murdered him in cold blood.

24:20.425 --> 24:21.460
Roger, be quiet.

24:22.160 --> 24:26.541
Yes, if you're not careful, you may find
yourself facing an accusation of slander.

24:26.731 --> 24:28.973
How can you defame a murderess?
She made me an orphan.

24:29.134 --> 24:32.809
You are 55 years old, my love.
These things happen.

24:33.271 --> 24:35.877
You're right. I'm sorry.

24:36.308 --> 24:38.550
- No. No.
- Please go on.

24:40.745 --> 24:43.988
You are the managing director
of Associated Catering.

24:44.149 --> 24:46.959
- Your father's company.
- One of his companies.

24:47.118 --> 24:50.793
He gave it to me, but you're quite right,
it is his. Everything is, really.

24:50.956 --> 24:53.402
In my father's house,
there are many mansions.

24:53.792 --> 24:57.137
- And the last time you spoke?
- We spoke all the time. Why ask that?

24:57.295 --> 24:59.571
- It's a simple question.
- What do you mean?

24:59.764 --> 25:02.404
Perhaps we could continue this
at a later date?

25:02.567 --> 25:05.810
Do you know what I'd like to do?
I'd like to strangle that woman.

25:05.971 --> 25:08.247
He doesn't know what he's talking about.

25:08.406 --> 25:10.249
She's a gold digger, first to last.

25:10.408 --> 25:13.048
And she poisoned a defenseless old man!

25:13.211 --> 25:17.023
- Your husband has a very sharp temper.
- Oh, he'd never hurt a fly.

25:17.182 --> 25:21.688
Loving your father is quite natural,
of course, but this borders on idolatry.

25:21.853 --> 25:25.065
Being the favorite child isn't all jam.

25:26.057 --> 25:28.333
- Oh, let me give you a hand with those.
- No, no.

25:28.493 --> 25:30.166
- Please.
- I like to keep busy.

25:30.328 --> 25:34.333
Especially now that the children
really don't need me anymore.

25:34.499 --> 25:36.342
Or not for much longer.

25:36.501 --> 25:39.710
That's the destiny of a nanny, I suppose.

25:39.871 --> 25:42.613
Are you the only member of staff
employed here?

25:43.308 --> 25:46.585
Yeah. Pretty much me and cook just now.

25:46.745 --> 25:48.952
Because of Mr. Leonides' death.

25:49.114 --> 25:51.788
They want to keep the house quiet
and private.

25:51.950 --> 25:55.454
But the servants here usually come
and go anyway.

25:55.620 --> 25:57.224
Who's that with Sophia?

25:57.822 --> 25:59.461
That's Mr. Brown, sir.

25:59.624 --> 26:01.934
Children's tutor.

26:02.894 --> 26:05.807
Go gentle with Mrs. Leonides.

26:05.964 --> 26:08.877
She's not as tough as the rest.

26:28.587 --> 26:30.430
May I come in?

26:31.423 --> 26:34.268
Why, you're not what I expected at all.

26:37.162 --> 26:39.267
What have they all been saying about me...

26:39.431 --> 26:41.638
...all of them down there?

26:44.502 --> 26:47.506
Don't worry, I can guess.

26:49.240 --> 26:51.083
Beasts.

26:51.910 --> 26:53.981
So what if I'm 37.

26:54.145 --> 26:57.024
We married for love.
So, what's wrong with that?

26:58.149 --> 27:01.619
They were born rich. So they think
no one else is good enough.

27:01.786 --> 27:03.789
How did you and your husband meet?

27:04.522 --> 27:06.661
I was a dancer in Las Vegas.

27:07.158 --> 27:10.867
Yes. He had some business there.

27:11.029 --> 27:13.805
One day he walked into the casino
where I was working.

27:13.965 --> 27:16.468
And he saw me crying.

27:17.702 --> 27:22.174
Please, don't think
that crying is my natural state.

27:22.340 --> 27:25.014
- No.
- But I had gotten into some trouble...

27:25.176 --> 27:28.123
...like a dreadful little servant girl.

27:28.279 --> 27:30.623
You mean pregnant?

27:31.983 --> 27:34.463
I was tired of men.

27:35.654 --> 27:37.793
I wanted a home.

27:39.190 --> 27:40.931
I dreamed of someone nice...

27:41.292 --> 27:43.568
...who would make a fuss over me.

27:44.029 --> 27:47.704
Then he said, "Sit down.
Tell me what's wrong."

27:47.866 --> 27:52.144
I said, "I can't, I'll get sacked
for sitting with a customer."

27:52.671 --> 27:56.585
Then he said, "No, you won't.
I own the place."

27:56.741 --> 27:59.017
Your husband owned a casino in Las Vegas?

27:59.177 --> 28:01.487
Well, it wasn't public knowledge.

28:01.646 --> 28:03.489
He was more of a silent partner.

28:03.848 --> 28:06.988
Your arrival here...

28:07.152 --> 28:09.428
...must have caused quite a stir.

28:09.587 --> 28:13.000
I vowed I would be a really good wife...

28:13.158 --> 28:15.229
...and I was.

28:17.062 --> 28:20.043
But we could never get rid
of that family of his.

28:20.198 --> 28:24.271
Always coming and sponging
and living in his pocket.

28:24.469 --> 28:25.846
And what about the baby?

28:26.838 --> 28:30.479
Turns out there wasn't one after all.
It was all a mistake.

28:31.876 --> 28:34.584
Did your husband have
any evening routines, or...

28:34.746 --> 28:38.216
Well, he liked a bit of television.

28:39.184 --> 28:41.391
He would come in here.

28:41.853 --> 28:43.298
This was his chair.

28:44.422 --> 28:47.961
Sometimes I would put on music,
and he would watch me dance.

28:48.126 --> 28:49.605
He liked that a lot.

28:52.363 --> 28:56.402
Some evenings he worked straight
through with Mr. Brown...

28:56.568 --> 28:58.480
...the kids' tutor.

28:58.636 --> 29:00.616
They got along well.

29:04.442 --> 29:05.785
What were they working on?

29:06.511 --> 29:08.582
Aristide was writing his memoirs.

29:11.149 --> 29:12.822
Now...

29:13.017 --> 29:15.964
I have a delicate question for you,
Mrs. Leonides.

29:16.888 --> 29:18.231
I wish you'd call me Brenda.

29:21.826 --> 29:23.738
- The insulin.
- Yes?

29:23.895 --> 29:26.273
Did your husband inject himself?

29:26.931 --> 29:28.433
Yes, but...

29:28.600 --> 29:30.409
That night...

29:32.036 --> 29:33.640
...I did it.

29:34.139 --> 29:35.641
He asked me to do it.

29:35.974 --> 29:39.319
He was tired, he said, and he asked me to.

29:39.644 --> 29:41.123
All right.

29:42.180 --> 29:45.491
Nanny says some of the family
suspect poison killed him.

29:46.684 --> 29:48.288
Yes.

29:48.453 --> 29:51.559
- It is... It is a possibility.
- You see?

29:51.923 --> 29:53.027
I killed him.

29:53.191 --> 29:56.502
The police will find my fingerprints
on the bottle and the syringe.

29:56.661 --> 30:00.507
But the bottle said "insulin," not "poison."

30:01.132 --> 30:04.341
And if I was the murderer, I would
have wiped them off, wouldn't I?

30:05.870 --> 30:07.474
Wouldn't I?

30:40.638 --> 30:42.743
- Sir.
- Sit.

30:45.310 --> 30:46.687
Do you know this woman?

30:47.011 --> 30:48.991
Yes, Sophia de Haviland.

30:49.147 --> 30:50.558
She works at Sotheby's.

30:50.715 --> 30:52.888
She doesn't let anyone near her.

30:53.051 --> 30:57.193
But rumor has it that you two get along well.

30:57.355 --> 30:59.392
- Do you know who this is?
- Aristide Leonides.

30:59.557 --> 31:04.199
Well, this woman's real name
is Sophia Leonides.

31:04.696 --> 31:06.676
His granddaughter.

31:06.831 --> 31:09.869
I guess she forgot to mention that,
didn't she?

31:10.735 --> 31:14.274
You see, we know for a fact
that Leonides was in bed with the CIA...

31:14.439 --> 31:16.385
...since the Greek Civil War.

31:16.541 --> 31:17.747
And we don't know why.

31:18.443 --> 31:23.085
And considering all that's going on
in this country at the moment...

31:23.248 --> 31:25.251
...we want to make sure her presence here...

31:25.416 --> 31:28.295
...and the fact that she's hiding
her true identity...

31:28.453 --> 31:30.763
...are just coincidence.

31:30.922 --> 31:34.165
- I'm sure there's a good reason why she...
- Look.

31:35.260 --> 31:39.265
You're bored in the embassy and you
want to work in intelligence, is that right?

31:39.430 --> 31:43.242
- Yes.
- Then consider her your way in.

32:35.920 --> 32:36.990
No, no, no...

32:37.922 --> 32:40.027
I've been looking for you.

32:40.591 --> 32:44.198
- What are you doing here? This is Mr....
- Aristide Leonides' study. I know.

32:44.362 --> 32:45.602
What are you doing here?

32:45.763 --> 32:47.970
Mr. Leonides gave me access to it.

32:48.132 --> 32:49.668
I can see that.

32:49.834 --> 32:52.007
So you're this private investigator...

32:52.170 --> 32:54.343
- ...and you want to question me.
- Yes.

32:54.839 --> 32:58.343
I haven't met Eustace yet.
What can you tell me about him?

32:59.010 --> 33:01.718
He's what they call now a "teenager."

33:01.879 --> 33:03.483
Rebellious. Angry.

33:03.648 --> 33:07.221
Despises authority. Loves rock 'n' roll.

33:07.385 --> 33:11.026
Thinks for himself too, which is quite
an achievement in this house.

33:11.189 --> 33:13.897
And he doesn't like being tutored at home.

33:14.058 --> 33:15.128
So why is he?

33:15.293 --> 33:18.638
The reason Mr. Leonides gave
was his childhood palsy.

33:18.796 --> 33:20.867
He would be bullied for his limp.

33:21.032 --> 33:22.375
But you don't think so?

33:22.533 --> 33:24.513
Mr. Leonides was really controlling.

33:32.377 --> 33:34.254
You were helping him with his memoirs?

33:34.412 --> 33:36.153
Yes, that...

33:36.981 --> 33:38.255
That's highly confidential.

33:38.416 --> 33:40.919
- Were you with him that night?
- Yes, we worked late.

33:41.085 --> 33:43.224
Several interruptions.

33:43.821 --> 33:47.701
- Visitors?
- Yes. Roger first and then Magda.

33:48.092 --> 33:49.594
Do you know what they wanted?

33:49.794 --> 33:52.070
Well, neither of them
are especially discreet.

33:52.230 --> 33:54.733
Roger was in some sort of crisis
about the business...

33:54.899 --> 33:58.369
...and Magda wanted Mr. Leonides
to finance her film.

33:58.536 --> 34:00.209
<i>Exposure.</i>

34:00.371 --> 34:01.850
Did he agree to it?

34:02.006 --> 34:05.419
No. She does plays that no one sees.

34:05.576 --> 34:07.613
Her husband writes books that no one reads.

34:07.812 --> 34:10.418
What do these people know
about the real world anyway?

34:10.581 --> 34:11.753
Anyone else visit?

34:12.216 --> 34:13.889
Sophia.

34:15.018 --> 34:17.864
She's a little more discreet than the others.

34:19.257 --> 34:22.067
That's the house where Mr. Leonides was born.

34:30.101 --> 34:31.944
I'd like to see a copy of the memoirs.

34:32.103 --> 34:36.245
- There's only the original.
- Then the original it will have to be.

34:37.875 --> 34:39.911
It's gone missing.

34:43.081 --> 34:45.960
There's only one thing for you.

35:16.481 --> 35:18.984
- Does your tortoise have a name?
- Salome.

35:19.150 --> 35:23.599
Mommy did a play called <i>Salome.</i>
It wasn't a great success, I'm afraid.

35:24.088 --> 35:26.125
Salome danced before King Herod.

35:26.290 --> 35:29.897
And he liked it so much, he said that
she could have whatever she wanted.

35:30.194 --> 35:32.640
Are you done with your interrogation?

35:33.131 --> 35:34.838
For today.

35:34.999 --> 35:36.501
Did you find many clues?

35:37.268 --> 35:38.804
You know, Josephine...

35:38.970 --> 35:44.284
...the first round of interrogation
is not so much about finding clues...

35:44.442 --> 35:48.447
...as it is about getting a sense
of who you're dealing with.

35:48.613 --> 35:50.650
You're lucky you're able to talk to them.

35:50.815 --> 35:53.159
As a family,
we don't actually talk that much.

35:53.317 --> 35:54.660
Except Magda, of course.

35:54.819 --> 35:57.493
But all she speaks about is herself.

36:01.926 --> 36:04.338
It must be very sad for you
to lose your grandfather.

36:04.495 --> 36:06.805
Not really. I didn't like him.

36:06.964 --> 36:09.467
He stopped me from being a ballet dancer.

36:09.634 --> 36:13.480
He said I'd be no good.
And I really love ballet.

36:13.638 --> 36:14.673
Sorry to hear that.

36:16.240 --> 36:19.244
Josephine, what can you tell me
about Mr. Brown?

36:19.443 --> 36:21.685
Laurence is having an affair with Brenda.

36:22.380 --> 36:24.485
They write letters to each other.

36:24.649 --> 36:25.923
They're awfully soppy.

36:26.083 --> 36:28.427
- Laurence is soppy.
- How do you know this?

36:28.586 --> 36:33.160
"Oh, my darling, I need you
more than the air that I breathe."

36:33.324 --> 36:34.894
You're making this up, aren't you?

36:35.059 --> 36:38.598
I also know where they're hidden.
I know lots of things.

36:38.763 --> 36:40.936
I listen at doors.

36:41.098 --> 36:43.271
People don't pay attention
to me in this house.

36:43.467 --> 36:45.003
They're way too selfish for that.

36:45.169 --> 36:48.344
But I pay attention to them.
Bye-bye, Mr. Hayward.

36:49.507 --> 36:50.542
Bye.

36:50.708 --> 36:52.449
- Hello, darling.
- Hello.

36:52.610 --> 36:55.386
Closing in on your prey, Mr. Hayward?

36:55.546 --> 36:56.786
- Lady Edith...
- Yes.

36:56.981 --> 36:59.723
...I was wondering,
are the gates locked at night?

36:59.884 --> 37:01.193
Religiously.

37:01.352 --> 37:04.561
Aristide was a fervent believer
in the communist threat.

37:04.722 --> 37:09.194
Personally, I can't conceive
of Swinley Dean having a very active cell.

37:09.360 --> 37:11.465
Unless, of course, you count our Mr. Brown.

37:11.629 --> 37:14.109
He is an intellectual, isn't he?

37:14.732 --> 37:18.407
- May I ask you a blunt question?
- They're the only interesting kind.

37:18.569 --> 37:22.073
What's wrong with people in this house?

37:24.108 --> 37:25.985
It is a blunt question indeed.

37:26.143 --> 37:28.487
- Sorry.
- Don't be.

37:28.646 --> 37:30.319
Passion.

37:30.748 --> 37:35.424
It is a hothouse of suppressed passion.

37:35.586 --> 37:40.501
This is what happens when the person
you love the most in the world...

37:40.658 --> 37:43.138
...who you would give your life for...

37:43.294 --> 37:46.173
...is actually the same person
that you hate the most.

37:46.931 --> 37:48.934
I'm certain you understand, Mr. Hayward.

37:50.067 --> 37:54.277
You wouldn't be in this house
yourself otherwise, would you?

40:14.211 --> 40:15.246
<i>Hello?</i>

40:15.413 --> 40:16.756
Brent?

40:16.914 --> 40:18.416
It's Charles Hayward.

40:18.582 --> 40:22.553
<i>Charlie, what a surprise.</i>

40:22.720 --> 40:24.962
<i>What can I do for you, buddy?</i>

40:25.423 --> 40:27.994
Aristide Leonides.

40:28.192 --> 40:29.227
<i>What about him?</i>

40:40.137 --> 40:41.980
What are you doing here?

40:42.139 --> 40:45.143
No, Charles. The question is:

40:45.309 --> 40:47.221
What are you doing now?

40:48.579 --> 40:50.491
Not scared, are you?

40:50.648 --> 40:52.594
- Not in the least.
- You should be.

41:12.770 --> 41:14.147
So you like it?

41:27.251 --> 41:29.561
Let's go upstairs.

41:33.557 --> 41:37.369
This is what my grandfather wanted me
to keep him up to date on.

41:37.528 --> 41:39.565
What the young people were doing.

41:39.763 --> 41:41.800
The music scene.

41:41.966 --> 41:46.039
He believed that this was the future
for his business. Leisure, entertainment.

41:46.203 --> 41:49.707
I suppose that's what he meant
by the world going soft after the war.

41:49.874 --> 41:52.286
So this is what Vegas was about?

41:53.978 --> 41:56.390
I suppose you don't want to talk
about his memoirs either.

41:59.149 --> 42:01.994
You know, I saw a picture of you.
As a ballerina.

42:03.220 --> 42:06.895
That was when I was a little girl,
before I injured my knee.

42:07.057 --> 42:08.161
You were sweet.

42:08.325 --> 42:11.363
Will you shut up
and light my bloody cigarette?

42:17.401 --> 42:18.436
Charles.

42:19.169 --> 42:21.012
This little girl feels like dancing.

43:30.274 --> 43:32.481
Just like in Cairo.

43:59.970 --> 44:03.782
<i>The last will and testament
of Aristide Leonides...</i>

44:03.941 --> 44:06.786
<i>...which was drawn up by me
and signed by him...</i>

44:06.944 --> 44:11.723
...in front of all his family members,
on the 24th of July, 1957.

44:12.449 --> 44:15.123
In it, each and every one of them
is handsomely...

44:15.285 --> 44:18.198
...and equitably provided for.

44:18.856 --> 44:21.166
However, Mr. Hayward...

44:21.325 --> 44:24.397
...Miss Leonides has
specifically instructed me...

44:24.561 --> 44:27.906
...to give you all the information you need.

44:28.065 --> 44:32.036
But I hope I can rely
on your absolute discretion here.

44:32.202 --> 44:33.237
Of course.

44:33.437 --> 44:36.976
Because, as I just told the family,
we realized only this morning...

44:37.141 --> 44:39.519
...that this will has no signature.

44:39.677 --> 44:42.385
Everyone present,
myself included, saw him sign...

44:42.546 --> 44:45.652
Or, rather, we thought
we saw him sign it. But...

44:45.816 --> 44:47.819
He died intestate?

44:47.985 --> 44:49.555
So it would appear.

44:49.720 --> 44:52.724
But if he died intestate, then...

44:52.890 --> 44:56.770
Then the primary beneficiary of the will
is, of course...

44:56.960 --> 44:59.338
...the second Mrs. Leonides.

44:59.496 --> 45:00.566
Brenda.

45:00.731 --> 45:01.766
Indeed.

45:12.843 --> 45:13.878
Josephine!

45:17.047 --> 45:19.186
Josephine!

45:40.604 --> 45:42.049
Thank you.

45:42.206 --> 45:43.549
Nice setup.

45:43.707 --> 45:45.414
What do you want?

45:51.615 --> 45:53.618
I know about the will.

45:54.251 --> 45:55.821
And I also know that you had...

45:56.019 --> 45:59.762
...a heated discussion
with your father the night he died.

46:00.824 --> 46:03.930
Now, a stab in the dark...

46:04.628 --> 46:08.167
...but might it have concerned
the imminent collapse...

46:08.332 --> 46:10.403
...of Associated Catering?

46:10.567 --> 46:13.446
You're an extremely intrusive person,
Mr. Hayward.

46:13.604 --> 46:16.107
I thought you could do with some...

46:17.674 --> 46:19.085
Now, what was it?

46:19.243 --> 46:23.248
One last attempt to get your father
to bail you out? And he refused?

46:30.053 --> 46:33.933
It's made out to Associated Catering,
for 2 million pounds.

46:36.660 --> 46:39.470
This sort of money would solve
most people's problems.

46:39.630 --> 46:40.802
Not mine.

46:40.964 --> 46:43.171
All I ever did was let him down.

46:43.333 --> 46:47.179
But he always forgave me
and bailed me out. Again and again.

46:48.472 --> 46:53.080
That night, Clemency told me
to destroy this check.

46:53.844 --> 46:58.122
That it would be the end of me if I were
to accept one more penny from my father.

46:59.183 --> 47:01.220
But I'm not as strong as my wife.

47:01.718 --> 47:03.698
The next morning...

47:04.955 --> 47:06.798
...he was dead.

47:25.309 --> 47:26.913
There you are.

47:30.047 --> 47:31.720
Don't creep up on people like that.

47:31.882 --> 47:35.660
People who eavesdrop
seldom hear good of themselves.

47:35.819 --> 47:39.323
And put that horrid notebook away.

48:06.950 --> 48:10.125
- Hello?
- Buddy, you're being followed.

48:10.287 --> 48:12.858
<i>Yes, I know. I thought it was you.</i>

48:13.023 --> 48:15.128
Oh, you could never spot us that easily.

48:15.292 --> 48:17.238
So do you have anything for me?

48:17.394 --> 48:20.204
<i>Only if you tell me
why you left the Foreign Office.</i>

48:20.364 --> 48:23.243
You were promising.
And the free world needs people like you.

48:23.400 --> 48:25.971
The free world. Please.

48:26.169 --> 48:28.240
<i>Yeah, all right.</i>

48:28.405 --> 48:30.146
<i>Leonides was a friend of ours.</i>

48:30.307 --> 48:33.720
But I don't think his death
has anything to do with that.

48:34.878 --> 48:36.380
What was your business with him?

48:36.546 --> 48:38.549
He helped us in Greece during the civil war.

48:38.715 --> 48:41.890
Financed a bunch
of anti-communist organizations.

48:42.052 --> 48:46.330
Gave money to the right people.
In return, we helped him out in the States.

48:46.490 --> 48:48.766
<i>Helped him cover up
some of his shady businesses.</i>

48:48.926 --> 48:51.133
Which explains Las Vegas.

48:51.295 --> 48:52.774
<i>He was a strange cat.</i>

48:53.196 --> 48:57.577
Saw himself as the next
Alexander the Great or something.

48:57.734 --> 49:01.910
- He had a thing for empires.
- And the British Empire is falling apart.

49:02.072 --> 49:03.642
Every dog has his day.

49:04.408 --> 49:05.785
- And that's it?
<i>- Look...</i>

49:05.943 --> 49:09.516
...everybody wants to know who killed him.
And nobody has a damn clue.

49:09.713 --> 49:11.625
But we're talking about a lot of money.

49:11.782 --> 49:14.991
This guy was everywhere, like an octopus.

49:15.152 --> 49:17.291
So who benefits from his death?

49:17.821 --> 49:19.425
It's just far too obvious.

49:19.589 --> 49:22.593
Maybe your friend in the car could help us.

49:32.302 --> 49:34.111
Hi. I believe we have a mutual friend.

49:34.271 --> 49:35.477
- Sorry?
- Your wife.

49:35.639 --> 49:37.380
What? What can...

49:37.541 --> 49:39.384
- Hey.
- Get off, get off, get off!

49:39.543 --> 49:41.022
Hey, calm down.

49:41.178 --> 49:46.457
We just want to know who you are.
Hey, hey. There we go, come on. Yeah.

49:47.184 --> 49:48.356
Oh, boy.

49:49.019 --> 49:53.695
Charles, meet Sergeant Glover
of Scotland Yard.

49:56.493 --> 49:58.200
Easy. Easy, big fella.

49:58.362 --> 50:01.969
- What on earth were you thinking?
- Charles, it's not as bad as it looks.

50:02.132 --> 50:04.374
I would have thought, considering
your friendship with my father...

50:04.534 --> 50:06.173
...you would have more trust in me.

50:06.336 --> 50:09.215
I swore I would look after you
should anything happen to him.

50:09.373 --> 50:11.910
You're saying to me that this...
This clown of a man...

50:12.075 --> 50:13.520
...was there to protect me.

50:13.677 --> 50:15.554
- If anyone's the clown...
- Shut up, Glover.

50:15.712 --> 50:19.490
He's right, you are a clown.
Now, get out of here.

50:21.718 --> 50:25.860
Charles, you have to understand,
I'm under a lot of pressure here.

50:26.023 --> 50:28.902
There's politics involved here.
It's sensitive.

50:29.059 --> 50:31.665
- And with your past...
- I'm sorry, my past?

50:31.828 --> 50:34.172
- In Cairo.
- I was a diplomat.

50:34.331 --> 50:36.777
Of course. And I'm a duchess.

50:36.933 --> 50:40.711
Now, give me something,
so I can still have faith in you.

50:41.104 --> 50:42.708
All right.

50:43.573 --> 50:45.018
Any of them could've done it.

50:45.175 --> 50:48.179
They all had means. They all had opportunity.

50:48.345 --> 50:49.881
Motive?

50:50.047 --> 50:53.051
Anger, jealousy, love, greed. Take your pick.

50:53.216 --> 50:55.787
So no communist?

50:55.952 --> 50:58.398
No Las Vegas mafia?

50:58.555 --> 51:00.899
No CIA conspiracy?

51:01.058 --> 51:02.560
We're investigating too.

51:02.726 --> 51:04.103
Quietly.

51:04.261 --> 51:07.265
But you can go in the house
without a warrant.

51:07.431 --> 51:11.880
Get back in there and find out
who killed the bloody midget.

51:33.356 --> 51:35.563
Brenda admits she gave the fatal injection.

51:35.725 --> 51:38.433
But anyone, anyone,
could have swapped out those bottles.

51:38.595 --> 51:41.633
- Including her.
- Yes, including him.

51:42.065 --> 51:44.636
Tell me, how would Brenda
have known the consequences...

51:44.801 --> 51:46.610
...of swapping out the insulin
with the eye drops?

51:46.770 --> 51:48.249
Oh, we all knew about that.

51:48.405 --> 51:51.443
He made a point of telling us
about it at his 86th birthday party.

51:51.608 --> 51:55.579
He went into great detail explaining
how we could do away with him.

51:56.513 --> 51:58.618
Yes, he had a very twisted sense of fun.

51:58.782 --> 52:00.523
You met with him the night he died.

52:01.585 --> 52:04.657
Yes, he wanted to discuss family matters.

52:04.821 --> 52:06.824
Family was pretty much everything to him.

52:06.990 --> 52:08.970
Well, you can tell me about Laurence Brown.

52:09.126 --> 52:11.129
Did you know he was having an affair
with Brenda?

52:11.294 --> 52:13.331
I suppose I knew something might be going on.

52:13.497 --> 52:15.534
And what if your grandfather had found out?

52:15.699 --> 52:18.976
- I'm quite sure he knew all about it.
- And he didn't mind?

52:19.136 --> 52:21.548
It's highly likely
that when he selected Laurence...

52:21.705 --> 52:25.676
...as tutor to his grandchildren,
he was also selecting him as Brenda's...

52:26.676 --> 52:29.486
- Yes.
- To keep Brenda happy.

52:33.316 --> 52:36.297
Then I suppose you know
he didn't sign the will?

52:36.820 --> 52:38.891
Well, yes! That was a surprise.

52:39.055 --> 52:40.466
So Brenda gets the lot.

52:40.624 --> 52:44.436
Including, I would say,
the final nail in her coffin.

53:16.693 --> 53:18.570
What's the hurry, Josephine?

53:18.728 --> 53:22.870
I hear you're making progress. But you
won't be the one who solves this case.

53:23.033 --> 53:24.876
If anything, you're Watson.

53:25.035 --> 53:27.242
Is that right?

53:27.404 --> 53:30.351
Well, why don't you enlighten me, Holmes?

53:30.507 --> 53:32.919
- Tell me about those letters.
- What letters?

53:33.076 --> 53:35.454
You know, the ones that Brenda
and Laurence Brown...

53:35.612 --> 53:38.559
- ...are supposedly writing to each other.
- Oh, I made that up.

53:38.715 --> 53:41.719
I often make things up.
It stops me from getting too bored.

53:41.885 --> 53:45.458
I don't believe you. I know you know things.

53:45.622 --> 53:48.626
Sometimes people don't know what they know.

53:48.792 --> 53:51.602
- There you are.
- What do you want now, Nanny?

53:51.761 --> 53:55.038
Your hot chocolate's ready.
Look, your ballet shoes are all muddy.

53:55.198 --> 53:58.441
I don't like hot chocolate.
You only make it so you can drink it.

53:58.602 --> 54:00.309
It will give you a good night's rest.

54:00.503 --> 54:02.915
Not everything they say
on television is true.

54:03.073 --> 54:04.643
Just leave me alone.

54:04.808 --> 54:07.414
- Mr. Hayward.
- Afternoon.

54:09.713 --> 54:12.387
- What?
- I'd say we're due another murder.

54:12.549 --> 54:13.892
Don't you think, Watson?

54:14.050 --> 54:15.620
Another murder, Holmes?

54:15.785 --> 54:18.163
Well, there's always a second murder.

54:18.321 --> 54:20.324
Someone who knows something is bumped off...

54:20.523 --> 54:22.730
...before they can reveal what they know.

54:39.676 --> 54:41.155
I didn't say you could come in.

54:41.311 --> 54:43.951
I'm sorry, I thought maybe
you couldn't hear me knock.

54:44.114 --> 54:48.426
I know every other ass in this house
is just begging to talk to you, but I'm not.

54:59.429 --> 55:00.874
You're boring me.

55:16.946 --> 55:20.485
Your tutor, Mr. Brown,
what do you make of him?

55:21.518 --> 55:24.124
I reckon Mr. Brown's
doing all right for himself.

55:24.287 --> 55:26.130
I wouldn't mind, would you?

55:26.289 --> 55:30.101
Though it's a bit weird,
fancying your grandfather's wife.

55:30.960 --> 55:34.032
Oh, I'm sorry, did I shock you?

55:34.197 --> 55:36.575
No, it's just, the fact is,
everyone fancies Granny.

55:36.733 --> 55:39.805
Uncle Roger has the hots for her.
You can tell.

55:39.969 --> 55:42.142
It must have amused Grandpa...

55:42.305 --> 55:46.083
...to put that cat amongst the pigeons
and watch the feathers fly.

55:46.242 --> 55:51.157
Now, I have a question for you,
Mr. Detective.

55:51.314 --> 55:55.262
I can't imagine there's anything that
I can tell you, you don't already know.

55:55.418 --> 55:57.898
Oh, yeah. Did you screw my sister in Cairo?

55:59.356 --> 56:01.859
Now, your grandfather has just died.

56:02.225 --> 56:05.229
A good thing, really.
It's one less capitalist.

56:05.395 --> 56:07.272
You don't know what you're talking about.

56:07.430 --> 56:10.775
I didn't hear you. Did you screw my sister?

56:10.934 --> 56:13.073
Are you really happy
your grandfather is dead?

56:13.236 --> 56:16.376
He was a control freak
who played with people's lives.

56:16.539 --> 56:19.418
He was a sadistic pig,
and his hubris was intolerable.

56:19.576 --> 56:22.682
And he got what he deserved.
I don't believe it was Brenda.

56:24.180 --> 56:26.057
She's not clever enough.

56:26.216 --> 56:28.389
She might have been set up though...

56:28.551 --> 56:30.724
...by someone clever.

56:52.275 --> 56:54.915
You really seem to make a habit
of barging in, don't you?

56:55.078 --> 56:57.285
- What do you want?
- It won't take a moment.

56:57.447 --> 57:01.953
When Brenda was first introduced
into the household...

57:02.118 --> 57:03.927
...did it rather upset the apple cart?

57:04.087 --> 57:06.465
The apple cart remained upright, as I recall.

57:06.623 --> 57:10.298
Nor was there any tasting of forbidden
fruits if that's what you're insinuating.

57:10.460 --> 57:11.996
Now, you really have to go.

57:12.195 --> 57:13.834
You forgave him?

57:13.997 --> 57:16.773
There was nothing to forgive.
It was a childish infatuation.

57:16.933 --> 57:20.437
Yes, I see. So love turned to hate?

57:21.004 --> 57:24.645
The reason my husband hates Brenda is
because he thinks she killed his father.

57:24.808 --> 57:27.516
- It's very simple.
- Yes, but you don't. You know different.

57:27.710 --> 57:29.690
- I must insist.
- I haven't finished.

57:29.846 --> 57:32.326
That night your husband showed you
the check his father gave him...

57:32.482 --> 57:34.655
...you told him to tear it up, but he didn't.

57:34.818 --> 57:38.630
Did you realize there would never be any
escape until your father-in-law was dead?

57:38.788 --> 57:42.793
Yes. That exact thought went through my mind.

57:42.959 --> 57:45.030
But now he is.

57:45.228 --> 57:46.832
So we can.

57:50.300 --> 57:51.540
One more thing.

58:17.494 --> 58:18.973
Sophia?

58:20.563 --> 58:22.304
What are you doing?

58:23.199 --> 58:24.576
Burning evidence?

58:24.767 --> 58:26.542
Chrissake!

58:26.703 --> 58:30.845
A reporter from <i>The Times</i> just called.
If he knows, soon everyone will.

58:32.342 --> 58:34.481
There was nothing of interest
regarding his murder...

58:34.644 --> 58:36.817
...in these memoirs, trust me.

58:37.280 --> 58:39.089
Trust you?

58:41.017 --> 58:43.554
During the war, he branched out.

58:44.554 --> 58:46.193
Bombs.

58:47.056 --> 58:50.560
First you destroy a city,
then you go in afterwards and rebuild it.

58:50.727 --> 58:54.175
I'm not sure
the world needs to know about that.

58:54.330 --> 58:55.775
That and other things.

58:55.932 --> 58:57.878
And that's for you to decide, is it?

58:58.034 --> 58:59.240
Yes, it is.

58:59.402 --> 59:02.349
So, what are you going
to do about it, Charles?

59:02.505 --> 59:05.315
What do you know about trust anyway?

59:25.862 --> 59:27.705
What's wrong?

59:28.431 --> 59:30.570
Car won't start.

59:33.603 --> 59:35.947
How very inconsiderate of it.

59:36.105 --> 59:38.984
Plenty of room here. We can
have someone fix it in the morning.

59:39.375 --> 59:40.979
Are you sure?

59:45.248 --> 59:48.821
Aunt Edith, I've been looking
all over for you. Where have you been?

59:48.985 --> 59:51.431
None of your business, dear.

59:51.588 --> 59:54.000
Fancy meeting you here at this late hour.

59:54.157 --> 59:55.796
My car seems to have broken down.

59:55.959 --> 59:58.963
Oh, what a shame. Such a nice car.

59:59.128 --> 01:00:01.608
For a penniless plod, anyway.

01:00:01.764 --> 01:00:03.334
That's the problem.

01:00:03.499 --> 01:00:05.604
I can't afford it, thirdhand.

01:00:06.002 --> 01:00:07.914
Would you like me to take you home?

01:00:08.071 --> 01:00:11.280
I've just invited Charles to stay the night.

01:00:11.441 --> 01:00:12.852
Now...

01:00:13.009 --> 01:00:16.123
...that's a much more interesting idea.

01:00:30.960 --> 01:00:34.271
Haven't seen this many people around
the table since before Granddad died.

01:00:34.430 --> 01:00:35.773
What's she doing here?

01:00:35.932 --> 01:00:38.435
- Nanny?
- Please don't make me miss all the fun.

01:00:38.601 --> 01:00:41.810
- No such thing in this room, pumpkin.
- Josephine.

01:00:41.971 --> 01:00:44.451
I put her to bed, Lady Edith.

01:00:44.607 --> 01:00:45.984
Well, clearly, she escaped.

01:00:46.142 --> 01:00:47.985
"Escaped"? She is not a prisoner.

01:00:48.144 --> 01:00:51.148
I don't want to go to bed, Aunt Edith.
I want to stay.

01:00:51.314 --> 01:00:53.521
I'm afraid you have no choice, my dear.

01:00:53.683 --> 01:00:55.720
With a smile, my little changeling.

01:00:58.421 --> 01:01:00.526
You'll have to tell me everything, Watson.

01:01:00.690 --> 01:01:03.466
It's Switzerland for that young lady,
the sooner the better.

01:01:03.626 --> 01:01:06.630
It's not good for her to be caught up
in this horrid business.

01:01:06.796 --> 01:01:08.742
You wanted them to grow up here.

01:01:08.931 --> 01:01:10.740
I wanted some discipline in their lives.

01:01:10.933 --> 01:01:13.880
I didn't think your father would control
their every move.

01:01:14.671 --> 01:01:18.050
Was I to know
that I'd be cheated of motherhood?

01:01:18.207 --> 01:01:21.677
Sometimes I wonder why you bothered
to have children at all, Magda.

01:01:21.844 --> 01:01:24.222
Soon as they were born,
you were off to repertory...

01:01:24.380 --> 01:01:27.828
...in the remotest provincial theater
you could find.

01:01:28.751 --> 01:01:32.597
There's something deeply moving about
a spinster's love for her sister's offspring.

01:01:33.056 --> 01:01:34.660
Moving and faintly desperate.

01:01:34.824 --> 01:01:38.067
Congratulations, Mother.
Another grandstand performance.

01:01:38.227 --> 01:01:41.231
Don't worry, Sophia.
I've lived through two World Wars.

01:01:41.397 --> 01:01:45.243
I can survive Magda's drunken,
little slings and arrows.

01:01:46.169 --> 01:01:47.273
Josephine is right.

01:01:47.470 --> 01:01:50.178
Your presence seems
to have brought everyone together.

01:01:50.339 --> 01:01:53.013
With one notable exception.

01:01:55.611 --> 01:01:57.989
The smell of blood.

01:01:58.414 --> 01:02:02.021
Now, I didn't realize
that your arrangements...

01:02:02.185 --> 01:02:04.392
...extended to board and lodging,
Mr. Hayward.

01:02:04.554 --> 01:02:06.124
Father, Charles is my guest.

01:02:06.289 --> 01:02:10.362
Guests don't snoop around, looking
on their hosts as potential murderers.

01:02:10.526 --> 01:02:13.063
I'm sure he thinks of all of us
as potential murderers.

01:02:13.229 --> 01:02:14.469
You can hardly blame him.

01:02:14.630 --> 01:02:17.577
Well, then, Charles.

01:02:17.734 --> 01:02:21.113
How about a blunt question for you, then?

01:02:21.270 --> 01:02:23.307
What are murderers like?

01:02:27.076 --> 01:02:29.249
Well, you.

01:02:30.780 --> 01:02:32.316
And me.

01:02:32.515 --> 01:02:34.119
Everyone.

01:02:34.784 --> 01:02:35.819
Hot-blooded.

01:02:36.285 --> 01:02:38.390
Cold-blooded.

01:02:38.554 --> 01:02:40.431
They do share one or two traits.

01:02:41.324 --> 01:02:42.894
Vanity.

01:02:43.292 --> 01:02:45.465
A distorted morality.

01:02:45.628 --> 01:02:48.074
A lack of empathy.

01:02:48.531 --> 01:02:50.773
And murderers tend to feel
that they are above...

01:02:50.933 --> 01:02:55.541
...the rules and laws
that govern ordinary mortals.

01:02:56.339 --> 01:03:00.617
Well, that description fits
every member of this family.

01:03:00.777 --> 01:03:02.814
I don't envy you your job.

01:03:02.979 --> 01:03:07.155
Nonsense, it's the easiest job
in the world. Open and shut.

01:03:07.316 --> 01:03:10.354
- I shall go to my room now.
- It's good of you to have come at all.

01:03:10.553 --> 01:03:12.965
Considering you couldn't
even show up at his funeral.

01:03:13.589 --> 01:03:15.592
I wouldn't have been able to stand it.

01:03:15.758 --> 01:03:17.533
You heard the weather forecast, you mean?

01:03:17.693 --> 01:03:20.435
None of us enjoy funerals,
but you could at least pretend.

01:03:20.596 --> 01:03:21.836
You're getting all our money.

01:03:21.998 --> 01:03:25.605
What kind of spell did you put
on that poor, poor sweetie pie?

01:03:25.768 --> 01:03:28.339
Aristide always loved dancers. You know that.

01:03:28.504 --> 01:03:29.949
You weren't a dancer.

01:03:30.106 --> 01:03:32.951
You were a girl on a stage in a bikini.

01:03:33.109 --> 01:03:35.612
Which doesn't explain
why he didn't sign his will.

01:03:35.778 --> 01:03:38.588
I've said all I have to say to Mr. Hayward.

01:03:39.081 --> 01:03:43.553
Surely we don't need a Pl in the house
for us all to tell each other the truth.

01:03:43.719 --> 01:03:46.461
Oh, Magda. Isn't that a line
from <i>The Last of Mrs. Cheyney?</i>

01:03:46.622 --> 01:03:47.726
No, it's not.

01:03:47.890 --> 01:03:50.735
But if you must know,
it's from a thriller I did at Frinton.

01:03:50.893 --> 01:03:52.634
I rest my case.

01:03:53.830 --> 01:03:55.537
Admit it, Brenda.

01:03:55.698 --> 01:03:58.736
You'd rather be with Laurence.
Are you two in this together?

01:03:58.901 --> 01:04:00.141
Of course they are.

01:04:00.837 --> 01:04:04.182
I hope all this money won't put
a strain on your principles, Mr. Brown.

01:04:04.607 --> 01:04:08.851
Brenda has her very own Red under the bed.

01:04:09.011 --> 01:04:10.547
Is that where you keep him?

01:04:10.713 --> 01:04:12.920
You don't know me. None of you do.

01:04:13.115 --> 01:04:14.560
Oh, I think we do.

01:04:14.717 --> 01:04:16.219
At least we know your type.

01:04:16.385 --> 01:04:18.262
Oh, dear, Mommy's in wrecking mode.

01:04:18.421 --> 01:04:21.129
I didn't murder him. I miss him.

01:04:21.624 --> 01:04:24.264
And any one of you could have
wished him out of the way.

01:04:24.427 --> 01:04:26.703
- What on earth do you mean?
- The film script.

01:04:27.563 --> 01:04:31.011
The reason he didn't back
the film script, I'm quite sure...

01:04:31.167 --> 01:04:34.273
...is he knew it would be a triumph
and lead to our independence.

01:04:36.138 --> 01:04:38.448
Right. He didn't even read it.

01:04:39.876 --> 01:04:42.083
- What?
- I did.

01:04:42.645 --> 01:04:44.090
So it's all your fault.

01:04:44.247 --> 01:04:46.727
No. I actually said it was pretty good.

01:04:46.883 --> 01:04:49.591
But he said he'd toss a coin for it,
as there were no dice.

01:04:49.752 --> 01:04:50.890
And he asked me to call.

01:04:53.289 --> 01:04:54.893
And you lost.

01:04:56.659 --> 01:04:59.401
And he said it was poetic justice.

01:04:59.562 --> 01:05:02.236
You see now why I didn't want you
involved with my family?

01:05:02.398 --> 01:05:03.468
Come on, Sophia.

01:05:03.666 --> 01:05:05.612
There's nothing like a real heart-to-heart.

01:05:05.768 --> 01:05:09.477
Assuming one could find
any real hearts under this roof.

01:05:09.672 --> 01:05:11.049
That's the point.

01:05:11.207 --> 01:05:14.985
Unlike all of you, I actually made him happy.

01:05:16.112 --> 01:05:19.423
That's why he gave me all the money.

01:05:24.954 --> 01:05:26.558
Well...

01:05:27.056 --> 01:05:30.504
...I'm sorry to interrupt
this oh-so-sweet family reunion...

01:05:30.693 --> 01:05:32.798
...but now I have something to say.

01:05:32.962 --> 01:05:36.171
Josephine could be right.
It is a fun evening after all.

01:05:36.332 --> 01:05:38.335
Not especially.

01:05:39.402 --> 01:05:40.904
Roger and I are leaving...

01:05:42.772 --> 01:05:44.012
...for good.

01:05:44.206 --> 01:05:45.651
- Anywhere nice?
- Barbados.

01:05:45.808 --> 01:05:48.152
Plenty of toxic plants for Clemency.

01:05:49.078 --> 01:05:52.856
We intend to create,
fund and manage an orphanage.

01:05:53.015 --> 01:05:54.995
Some people have all the luck.

01:05:55.151 --> 01:05:59.429
I'd have thought any need you had
for children was fully satisfied by Roger.

01:05:59.588 --> 01:06:02.467
Don't you ever get tired
of sounding superior?

01:06:02.625 --> 01:06:06.266
Ruin the family business
and bugger off to Barbados.

01:06:06.429 --> 01:06:08.033
How very like my brother.

01:06:08.230 --> 01:06:12.372
Better than losing everything
playing baccarat on the Riviera.

01:06:12.969 --> 01:06:14.676
Poor Roger.

01:06:14.837 --> 01:06:17.841
Who has no idea how fun life can be.

01:06:20.309 --> 01:06:21.618
He chose me.

01:06:22.945 --> 01:06:24.356
Yes.

01:06:24.513 --> 01:06:27.289
And every single day, I wonder why.

01:06:27.450 --> 01:06:29.327
But I never asked him...

01:06:30.553 --> 01:06:32.692
...to love me more than he loved you.

01:06:44.300 --> 01:06:45.335
Yes, Eustace?

01:06:45.501 --> 01:06:48.141
I have a question for Sophia.

01:06:48.804 --> 01:06:50.784
Did Mr. Hayward screw you in Cairo?

01:06:51.707 --> 01:06:54.313
No, it's just he seemed unsure
when I asked him.

01:06:54.477 --> 01:06:56.582
Don't be vulgar, Eustace.

01:06:57.179 --> 01:06:59.557
That's quite a sense of the dramatic.

01:06:59.715 --> 01:07:03.561
Can you explain what relevance that has
to our discussion, my darling boy?

01:07:03.719 --> 01:07:06.529
It is actually very relevant.

01:07:07.223 --> 01:07:08.725
What if she's the killer?

01:07:10.426 --> 01:07:11.666
And they're in it together.

01:07:43.759 --> 01:07:45.363
You see?

01:07:45.528 --> 01:07:47.770
They're coming after you now.

01:07:48.264 --> 01:07:50.267
These people.

01:07:50.433 --> 01:07:52.208
They bring out all the evil.

01:07:52.601 --> 01:07:54.240
Oh, Charles. I'm so frightened.

01:07:54.403 --> 01:07:55.746
What will happen next?

01:07:55.905 --> 01:07:58.317
The press, will they be dreadful?

01:07:58.474 --> 01:08:00.454
Don't give any interviews.

01:08:00.910 --> 01:08:04.449
You ought to get yourself a lawyer
to tell you what to do and what to say...

01:08:04.613 --> 01:08:07.389
- ...what not to do and what not...
- I need someone like you.

01:08:07.550 --> 01:08:08.790
Just hold tight.

01:08:08.951 --> 01:08:12.364
- Keep quiet, and it will be all right.
- Do you really think so?

01:08:13.489 --> 01:08:14.729
So she got to you.

01:08:14.890 --> 01:08:16.767
I knew she would.

01:08:18.359 --> 01:08:20.670
Sophia, wait.

01:08:20.863 --> 01:08:23.139
Sophia, stop! Sophia.

01:08:23.299 --> 01:08:26.178
You're just like the rest.
Take her to bed and be done with it.

01:08:26.368 --> 01:08:27.745
No. Stop it.

01:08:27.903 --> 01:08:29.644
I can see her side of it, that's all.

01:08:29.805 --> 01:08:32.115
Oh, what a high moral tone you're taking.

01:08:32.274 --> 01:08:35.687
I have to give it to her. She's got
a special gift for dividing people.

01:08:35.877 --> 01:08:37.482
- Now she's dividing us.
- What?

01:08:37.645 --> 01:08:40.456
Brenda hasn't divided us.
You walked away from me in Cairo.

01:08:40.616 --> 01:08:41.685
Yes.

01:08:41.884 --> 01:08:44.490
And did you ever ask yourself why?

01:08:55.430 --> 01:08:56.933
Please.

01:08:57.933 --> 01:09:00.345
Go away, Charles! You're fired.

01:09:00.502 --> 01:09:02.540
You won't be able to fire the police.

01:09:02.705 --> 01:09:04.446
Sophia!

01:09:49.218 --> 01:09:52.221
Oh, it's you.
I thought you were someone else.

01:09:52.388 --> 01:09:54.891
- What are you doing?
- Same as you. Detecting.

01:09:55.057 --> 01:09:56.195
- Up here?
- I must go.

01:09:57.092 --> 01:09:58.537
Wait.

01:10:08.537 --> 01:10:10.346
Josephine!

01:11:52.708 --> 01:11:54.585
Sensationalist tosh.

01:12:01.850 --> 01:12:04.228
You've been in the wars.

01:12:05.321 --> 01:12:10.032
Well, your husband's dogs and I
had a little cuddle last night.

01:12:10.192 --> 01:12:11.296
Suits you.

01:12:14.797 --> 01:12:15.901
You all right?

01:12:20.002 --> 01:12:22.346
We weren't always like this, you know...

01:12:22.504 --> 01:12:24.711
...my husband and I.

01:12:25.607 --> 01:12:29.055
We used to be
the most glamorous couple in London.

01:12:30.412 --> 01:12:33.723
They put our pictures in all the magazines.

01:12:34.650 --> 01:12:36.857
People looked up to us.

01:12:39.121 --> 01:12:41.067
I wonder what happened.

01:13:09.918 --> 01:13:11.056
You know, Charles...

01:13:11.854 --> 01:13:13.857
...they're trained combat dogs.

01:13:14.757 --> 01:13:18.398
They could kill you in an instant
if they really wanted to.

01:13:18.961 --> 01:13:22.431
- Meaning?
- Like the rest of us...

01:13:23.198 --> 01:13:25.041
...they like you.

01:13:27.035 --> 01:13:31.279
The man from the garage has arrived
to mend your car, Mr. Hayward.

01:13:31.774 --> 01:13:33.253
Right.

01:13:38.680 --> 01:13:42.787
Oh, these reporters are relentless!

01:13:52.394 --> 01:13:55.341
Starter cable. It's missing.

01:13:56.765 --> 01:13:58.574
Right, well...

01:14:00.636 --> 01:14:02.980
We can keep this between us.

01:14:04.473 --> 01:14:07.420
Charles, there's a call for you.

01:14:07.910 --> 01:14:09.913
Chief Inspector Taverner from Scotland Yard.

01:14:10.245 --> 01:14:13.249
I had pneumonia. Is that a crime?

01:14:13.415 --> 01:14:16.692
We are just trying to establish
the facts, Mr. Agrodopolous.

01:14:16.852 --> 01:14:20.163
Were you unaware Mr. Leonides was dead?

01:14:20.322 --> 01:14:22.632
Until I see the papers, yes.

01:14:22.791 --> 01:14:27.502
You think my son should read the death
columns to me every day in the hospital?

01:14:27.663 --> 01:14:29.939
How did you know Mr. Leonides?

01:14:30.098 --> 01:14:32.101
He helped me when I first arrived in London.

01:14:32.267 --> 01:14:33.302
Why?

01:14:33.469 --> 01:14:35.540
We Greeks stick together.

01:14:35.737 --> 01:14:37.046
That is why.

01:14:37.239 --> 01:14:39.515
Look, I don't know nothing.

01:14:39.675 --> 01:14:41.348
He gave me the envelope.

01:14:41.510 --> 01:14:44.958
When he dies, I take it to Gaitskill.

01:14:45.113 --> 01:14:47.150
And you never opened it?

01:14:48.484 --> 01:14:51.124
The envelope was closed
with an unbroken seal.

01:14:51.620 --> 01:14:54.567
Do you know the lawyers
who drew up this new will?

01:14:54.990 --> 01:14:59.530
Not personally, but I'm aware
that Mr. Leonides used them...

01:14:59.695 --> 01:15:01.800
...for the other side of his affairs.

01:15:02.197 --> 01:15:03.870
And you remain the executor.

01:15:04.500 --> 01:15:07.845
Yes, but without enthusiasm.

01:15:08.637 --> 01:15:10.708
He settled a small sum on the widow.

01:15:10.873 --> 01:15:13.786
The rest of the estate goes
to a single beneficiary.

01:15:15.377 --> 01:15:16.686
The granddaughter, Sophia.

01:15:19.281 --> 01:15:20.316
Yes?

01:15:21.817 --> 01:15:23.888
There's been a call from the Leonides house.

01:15:24.052 --> 01:15:26.294
- Yes?
- Someone's tried to kill the little girl.

01:15:27.556 --> 01:15:29.229
My God.

01:15:34.062 --> 01:15:35.439
The rope was cut half-through.

01:15:35.597 --> 01:15:37.668
- Who found her?
- I did.

01:15:37.833 --> 01:15:39.676
My father went with her in the ambulance.

01:15:39.835 --> 01:15:41.371
Does she remember anything?

01:15:41.537 --> 01:15:43.744
She was unconscious.

01:15:43.906 --> 01:15:46.614
She must have fallen from the very top.

01:15:47.075 --> 01:15:48.748
My poor cherub.

01:15:48.911 --> 01:15:53.860
- If you want to go there, I can drive you.
- Well, there's no great rush, no.

01:15:54.016 --> 01:15:56.553
Philip says they're doing
everything they can.

01:15:56.718 --> 01:15:58.960
Oh, if you want to make your mother happy...

01:15:59.121 --> 01:16:01.727
...I wouldn't say no to a gin and it.

01:16:01.890 --> 01:16:04.461
You were the one up there
in the tree house last night.

01:16:04.626 --> 01:16:08.335
I thought you were a prowler.
That's why I let the dogs out.

01:16:10.933 --> 01:16:12.913
Man named Gaitskill is here, sir.

01:16:13.068 --> 01:16:14.945
Oh, let him in.

01:16:15.871 --> 01:16:17.612
What's Gaitskill doing here?

01:16:25.914 --> 01:16:27.791
What a mess.

01:16:32.754 --> 01:16:35.735
This is a crime scene, Lady Edith.

01:16:36.158 --> 01:16:39.264
It is also my home.

01:17:30.846 --> 01:17:32.189
It's so unfair.

01:17:32.347 --> 01:17:33.724
What's going on?

01:17:33.915 --> 01:17:36.691
- Why is Gaitskill here?
- Ask Sophia.

01:17:43.325 --> 01:17:46.135
Let's usher in the reign of Queen Sophia.

01:17:46.995 --> 01:17:48.998
Allow me to congratulate you, Sophia.

01:17:49.164 --> 01:17:51.371
You are a very wealthy woman.

01:17:51.533 --> 01:17:56.346
If I may, I suggest you make a new will
at your earliest opportunity.

01:17:56.505 --> 01:17:58.985
A good day to you all.

01:18:03.011 --> 01:18:05.082
Madame Sophia.

01:18:05.547 --> 01:18:07.652
Your penniless and broken-down old mother...

01:18:08.450 --> 01:18:10.225
...begs you for alms.

01:18:11.053 --> 01:18:12.896
Spare us a copper, dear.

01:18:13.055 --> 01:18:16.036
Your ma wants to be in the pictures.

01:18:16.191 --> 01:18:20.606
You're very funny, my love, but perhaps
this isn't the time for clowning.

01:18:20.762 --> 01:18:23.402
I suppose you're going to bail Roger out.

01:18:23.565 --> 01:18:26.671
- We don't want any of the money.
- I will sell Associated Catering.

01:18:26.835 --> 01:18:29.839
- Good girl.
- No point throwing good money after bad.

01:18:32.674 --> 01:18:35.177
I was his eldest son.

01:18:35.343 --> 01:18:37.721
But to stab me in the back
with his dying breath...

01:18:37.879 --> 01:18:39.119
Look at you both.

01:18:39.281 --> 01:18:41.727
Desperate and humiliated...

01:18:41.883 --> 01:18:44.728
...because now you're going
to have to go to Sophia's door...

01:18:44.886 --> 01:18:46.263
...with your begging bowls.

01:18:46.588 --> 01:18:47.897
Get out of this room.

01:18:48.356 --> 01:18:50.393
Now!

01:18:57.899 --> 01:19:02.075
Beware of the vultures, sister, dear.

01:19:03.872 --> 01:19:05.943
It's one hell of a burden on your shoulders.

01:19:06.274 --> 01:19:08.618
I think we're forgetting ourselves.

01:19:08.777 --> 01:19:10.620
Philip, tell me.

01:19:10.779 --> 01:19:12.554
How is dear Josephine?

01:19:12.714 --> 01:19:14.455
Oh, I'm so sorry.

01:19:14.616 --> 01:19:17.096
She's going to be fine, thank God.
No broken bones.

01:19:17.252 --> 01:19:19.164
They want to keep her in for observation.

01:19:19.321 --> 01:19:20.493
Very wise.

01:19:20.655 --> 01:19:24.000
She should not be in this house.
Much too dangerous.

01:19:24.159 --> 01:19:27.607
Well, as entertaining as this is,
I've had enough of all the drama.

01:19:27.763 --> 01:19:31.802
Roger needs to be gone from this house.
We shall pack our bags, and we shall go.

01:19:31.967 --> 01:19:34.675
Congratulations, my darling.

01:19:37.105 --> 01:19:40.848
I have a sneaking suspicion
that he made the right choice.

01:19:45.313 --> 01:19:47.054
Sophia.

01:19:49.951 --> 01:19:52.363
You are an extremely clever woman.

01:19:52.554 --> 01:19:54.625
And you are a de Haviland.

01:19:54.790 --> 01:19:59.501
I have seen what it takes to operate at
a certain level, and it is not always pretty.

01:19:59.661 --> 01:20:01.868
So I want you to remember...

01:20:02.063 --> 01:20:07.172
...that lineage will help you find
what's most important in life.

01:20:07.669 --> 01:20:10.809
A sense of balance.

01:20:14.643 --> 01:20:18.853
Well, my angel,
perhaps we should talk about <i>Exposure.</i>

01:20:19.614 --> 01:20:21.617
I'm sorry, Papa.

01:20:22.384 --> 01:20:24.193
But your father wrote it.

01:20:31.993 --> 01:20:36.135
- At least read the bloody thing.
- It would only prolong the agony.

01:20:38.667 --> 01:20:40.146
Papa...

01:20:59.154 --> 01:21:00.997
Grandfather said fortunes don't last...

01:21:01.156 --> 01:21:03.830
...if they get split between
the weak members of a family.

01:21:03.992 --> 01:21:06.632
They should be concentrated
in the hands of the strong.

01:21:07.362 --> 01:21:09.069
Did you know about this will, Sophia?

01:21:09.931 --> 01:21:11.410
Yes.

01:21:13.034 --> 01:21:14.911
Looks bad, doesn't it?

01:21:16.638 --> 01:21:20.586
He first mentioned the idea
when things started to get ugly in Cairo.

01:21:20.742 --> 01:21:22.085
He said I should come back to England...

01:21:22.244 --> 01:21:24.281
...so he could teach me to handle his empire.

01:21:24.946 --> 01:21:26.255
That's why you left me.

01:21:27.282 --> 01:21:29.262
That and the fact you were spying on me.

01:21:29.417 --> 01:21:30.896
"Spying" is a big word.

01:21:31.052 --> 01:21:32.964
You broke my heart, Charles.

01:21:33.788 --> 01:21:36.098
And I resigned.

01:21:44.165 --> 01:21:47.442
- Why didn't you tell me about this will?
- I don't know.

01:21:48.536 --> 01:21:51.142
When it didn't turn up,
I thought it was another trick.

01:21:51.306 --> 01:21:54.082
He liked to toy with people.

01:21:54.242 --> 01:21:55.949
Must run in the blood.

01:21:56.111 --> 01:21:57.784
That's what he thought.

01:21:58.713 --> 01:22:01.091
He said I looked like a de Haviland...

01:22:01.249 --> 01:22:03.889
...but the blood in my veins was Leonides.

01:22:04.052 --> 01:22:05.964
So nothing could ever resist me.

01:22:06.121 --> 01:22:07.760
I think he may have had a point.

01:22:08.823 --> 01:22:11.736
You really believe I could have
murdered him, don't you?

01:22:17.399 --> 01:22:19.276
No, Sophia...

01:22:27.075 --> 01:22:30.614
Maybe Mr. Brown has taken up gardening.

01:22:30.779 --> 01:22:33.123
Or perhaps they were planted on him.

01:22:34.082 --> 01:22:37.427
- It's all a bit too convenient.
- It helps your girlfriend's case though.

01:22:37.585 --> 01:22:41.089
Worth killing for, that sort of pot of gold.

01:22:46.094 --> 01:22:48.097
She's not my girlfriend.

01:22:48.797 --> 01:22:51.300
I've taken over this investigation, Charles.

01:22:51.466 --> 01:22:53.537
Your position is compromised.

01:22:53.735 --> 01:22:56.875
- You should be with the other...
- Suspects.

01:22:57.038 --> 01:22:58.108
If you say so.

01:22:58.273 --> 01:23:00.810
Those are Lady Edith's secateurs.

01:23:00.976 --> 01:23:02.546
And they don't prove anything.

01:23:02.744 --> 01:23:05.020
Any knife could have been used
to cut those ropes.

01:23:05.180 --> 01:23:08.184
What we need is direct evidence
of a liaison...

01:23:08.350 --> 01:23:11.798
...between Mr. Brown and Mrs. Leonides.

01:23:20.862 --> 01:23:22.739
This is a joke, Charles.

01:23:22.897 --> 01:23:24.843
I'm afraid not.

01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:26.673
Well...

01:23:27.268 --> 01:23:29.305
...you go first then.

01:23:29.471 --> 01:23:30.973
Right.

01:23:37.812 --> 01:23:39.849
- Charles.
- Yes, sir?

01:23:40.015 --> 01:23:43.087
Is this what
a distinguished chief inspector...

01:23:43.284 --> 01:23:46.697
...should be doing in his golden years?

01:23:50.358 --> 01:23:51.496
Hallelujah.

01:24:15.183 --> 01:24:18.221
"Oh, Laurence, my darling, my own dear love.

01:24:18.386 --> 01:24:22.562
I cannot talk about last night.
For if I do, my heart will burst.

01:24:22.724 --> 01:24:26.467
It won't be long now
before we can be together."

01:24:26.628 --> 01:24:28.130
"My darling...

01:24:28.329 --> 01:24:33.301
...is impatience in a lover
a crime or a virtue?

01:24:33.468 --> 01:24:37.246
I don't want him to suffer,
not after his kindness to me...

01:24:37.405 --> 01:24:40.614
...but I do wish him gone."

01:25:30.158 --> 01:25:32.502
Mrs. Leonides.

01:25:33.628 --> 01:25:37.474
I have to ask you to accompany me
to Scotland Yard.

01:25:37.632 --> 01:25:39.441
I'm sorry?

01:25:40.201 --> 01:25:41.805
Anything you say...

01:25:41.970 --> 01:25:45.645
...may be taken down
and used in evidence against you.

01:25:45.807 --> 01:25:47.309
Do you understand?

01:25:52.213 --> 01:25:53.817
But I didn't write this.

01:25:53.982 --> 01:25:57.953
- Mrs. Leonides, please.
- I would never do anything like this.

01:26:03.224 --> 01:26:05.227
You show them some dignity.

01:26:09.197 --> 01:26:11.177
I didn't write that.

01:26:11.332 --> 01:26:14.006
I would never write that.

01:26:14.636 --> 01:26:16.309
No, it was them.

01:26:16.471 --> 01:26:18.508
It was them.

01:26:22.377 --> 01:26:24.380
- You must be so happy.
- You'll rot in hell.

01:26:24.546 --> 01:26:25.684
You old hypocrite!

01:26:26.080 --> 01:26:29.459
Daddy's little boy. You couldn't keep
your hands off me when I got here!

01:26:31.452 --> 01:26:33.022
Charlie, help me.

01:26:33.188 --> 01:26:34.497
These vampires.

01:26:34.656 --> 01:26:38.035
They set us up
because we're not part of their world.

01:26:38.193 --> 01:26:39.832
Don't let them fool you.

01:26:39.994 --> 01:26:41.974
Charles, please!

01:26:43.898 --> 01:26:45.775
They set us up!

01:26:48.503 --> 01:26:49.846
Here.

01:27:00.481 --> 01:27:03.257
We never stood a chance against them.

01:27:06.888 --> 01:27:10.563
Well, I was completely taken in
by her performance.

01:27:10.725 --> 01:27:13.296
Mother, if Brenda is guilty,
then she'll hang.

01:27:13.494 --> 01:27:14.939
- That's enough.
- She should be tortured.

01:27:15.096 --> 01:27:17.736
- You'll enjoy watching that.
- He wasn't your father.

01:27:17.899 --> 01:27:19.902
I loved my father. Understand? I loved him.

01:27:20.501 --> 01:27:22.606
More than you'll ever love me.

01:27:36.251 --> 01:27:38.094
Better now?

01:27:42.390 --> 01:27:46.930
I want Brenda to have the best lawyer
money can buy. We'll pay.

01:27:47.095 --> 01:27:50.304
She's always been out of her depth.

01:27:50.965 --> 01:27:52.604
Poor thing.

01:27:54.068 --> 01:27:57.948
- Where are you going?
- An appointment in town, dear.

01:27:59.974 --> 01:28:01.510
Well, Charles.

01:28:01.676 --> 01:28:04.282
You redeemed yourself at the last moment.

01:28:06.614 --> 01:28:08.958
Have to admit,
I couldn't have done it without you.

01:28:09.117 --> 01:28:11.290
The evidence is almost
entirely circumstantial.

01:28:11.452 --> 01:28:13.432
Usually is in a murder case.

01:28:13.588 --> 01:28:16.694
A lot depends on the impression
they make on the jury.

01:28:19.460 --> 01:28:21.872
And if you ever need a proper job...

01:28:22.864 --> 01:28:24.776
...you know where to find me.

01:28:24.932 --> 01:28:27.606
What are you thinking, Charles?

01:28:27.769 --> 01:28:30.113
That it still could be me?

01:28:30.571 --> 01:28:33.950
And I got away with it scot-free,
with all the money, thanks to you.

01:28:34.108 --> 01:28:37.647
And that's why I chose you
in the first place.

01:28:42.083 --> 01:28:45.895
Someone could have forged
those letters, couldn't they?

01:29:01.336 --> 01:29:03.316
They talk about you in the papers.

01:29:03.471 --> 01:29:05.246
How you helped solve the case.

01:29:05.406 --> 01:29:07.579
- Good morning, Miss Ackroyd.
- Oh, Mr. Hayward.

01:29:07.742 --> 01:29:09.381
This is the making of you.

01:29:09.544 --> 01:29:14.255
We can get in the decorators and everything.

01:29:21.322 --> 01:29:23.928
Here we are, pumpkin. Run along to Nanny.

01:29:24.125 --> 01:29:25.160
Here you are.

01:29:25.326 --> 01:29:28.569
Oh, I'm so glad to see you.

01:29:30.064 --> 01:29:33.239
I've missed a lot. I didn't need
to be kept in hospital all that time.

01:29:33.401 --> 01:29:35.540
Don't look so angry, my little changeling.

01:29:35.703 --> 01:29:37.683
Stop calling her that, Magda.

01:29:37.839 --> 01:29:42.413
How I address my own daughter,
Auntie, is none of your business.

01:29:44.078 --> 01:29:45.785
Josephine, darling, you're back.

01:29:48.883 --> 01:29:51.659
Tell me, what was Brenda
and Laurence's reaction?

01:29:52.086 --> 01:29:53.190
Did they beg for mercy?

01:29:53.354 --> 01:29:56.597
I wish you wouldn't talk
about people that way.

01:29:56.758 --> 01:29:58.795
They found love letters
on the tower's balcony.

01:29:58.960 --> 01:30:02.203
I knew it. I have to write it all down
in my notebook.

01:30:02.363 --> 01:30:04.309
Well, I'm off.

01:30:36.297 --> 01:30:38.243
Josephine!

01:30:38.766 --> 01:30:40.678
I cleaned these while you were away.

01:30:40.835 --> 01:30:43.907
And I'm making you
some hot chocolate. It will make you...

01:30:44.272 --> 01:30:46.650
- Oh, good gracious.
- Have you seen my notebook?

01:30:46.808 --> 01:30:47.843
Why? Have you lost it?

01:30:48.009 --> 01:30:50.080
I thought it was in my room. I can't find it.

01:30:50.244 --> 01:30:52.781
Well, have you tried the tree house?

01:30:52.947 --> 01:30:54.586
I know you took it. You hate it.

01:30:54.749 --> 01:30:57.423
All right, little lady, calm down.

01:30:57.585 --> 01:30:58.825
I'll find it.

01:31:09.864 --> 01:31:11.673
Lady Edith...

01:31:12.099 --> 01:31:15.740
...I'm afraid your results do not bode well.

01:31:17.872 --> 01:31:19.613
How long?

01:31:20.975 --> 01:31:22.818
Hard to tell.

01:31:24.846 --> 01:31:26.883
Maybe a few months.

01:31:28.883 --> 01:31:31.056
There is a promising
new experimental treatment.

01:31:31.252 --> 01:31:33.823
I don't want other treatments.

01:31:34.355 --> 01:31:37.393
It's over, isn't it?

01:31:46.200 --> 01:31:47.804
Well...

01:31:49.504 --> 01:31:52.679
...always leave a party at its height...

01:31:52.840 --> 01:31:55.411
...when you're most enjoying it.

01:31:58.679 --> 01:32:00.886
Nanny, milk's boiling!

01:32:03.484 --> 01:32:05.930
I'll be off now,
if that's all right, Mr. Hayward.

01:32:06.087 --> 01:32:08.499
Yes. I'll lock up.

01:32:09.156 --> 01:32:10.226
Thank you.

01:32:10.391 --> 01:32:13.668
So many people called today.

01:32:14.295 --> 01:32:15.740
Good night.

01:32:21.936 --> 01:32:23.677
Come in.

01:32:25.006 --> 01:32:26.781
Nanny's made your hot chocolate.

01:32:26.941 --> 01:32:28.887
I hate hot chocolate and Nanny knows it.

01:32:29.043 --> 01:32:33.583
- She only makes it for me so she...
- So she can drink it herself. I know.

01:32:36.417 --> 01:32:39.023
Why are you so angry, Josephine?

01:32:39.186 --> 01:32:40.290
I'm bored.

01:32:40.454 --> 01:32:42.957
And I can't find my notebook.

01:32:43.457 --> 01:32:45.869
It's okay. We'll find it.

01:34:59.026 --> 01:35:00.061
Charles Hayward.

01:35:17.978 --> 01:35:19.890
It's all quiet here, sir.

01:35:30.524 --> 01:35:33.130
I was the one who brought the mug up
to Josephine, but...

01:35:33.294 --> 01:35:34.534
But Nanny prepared it.

01:35:34.695 --> 01:35:39.269
But if she made it for Josephine,
why did she drink it?

01:35:39.433 --> 01:35:41.276
Just in time to say goodbye, Mr. Hayward.

01:35:42.036 --> 01:35:44.710
- Where are you going?
- London Airport.

01:35:44.872 --> 01:35:47.148
- Close the gates!
- Oh, don't be ridiculous.

01:35:47.308 --> 01:35:48.912
- We'll miss our flight.
- We understand...

01:35:49.076 --> 01:35:51.318
...how difficult this is,
but Roger and I are leaving...

01:35:51.512 --> 01:35:52.786
...so we can lead our lives.

01:35:52.947 --> 01:35:55.587
Why on earth would we want
to poison a nice old woman...

01:35:55.750 --> 01:35:58.287
- ...who had never done us harm?
- Perhaps she wasn't the intended target.

01:35:58.452 --> 01:35:59.658
Oh, excuse me?

01:35:59.820 --> 01:36:02.767
Hold on, Mr. Detective.
Can you prove anything?

01:36:02.923 --> 01:36:04.960
Can you prove it wasn't a heart attack?

01:36:05.126 --> 01:36:07.163
Or a suicide? Are you sure she was poisoned?

01:36:07.328 --> 01:36:10.605
The coroner is working on it as we speak.

01:36:10.765 --> 01:36:13.905
Nobody gets to leave here
without my express permission.

01:36:14.268 --> 01:36:17.681
Clemmy, call my lawyer. I want to check
if Chief Inspector Taverner's...

01:36:17.838 --> 01:36:19.909
...conduct is within the law.

01:36:20.074 --> 01:36:24.147
No one can bully us into spending
another day in this house!

01:36:25.446 --> 01:36:26.948
Josephine, you're safe now.

01:36:27.114 --> 01:36:29.560
You're with Mommy and Daddy.
We'll take care of you.

01:36:30.351 --> 01:36:32.661
Mr. Hayward,
you must be some sort of magician.

01:36:32.820 --> 01:36:34.925
Every time we make you disappear,
you keep popping back up.

01:36:35.089 --> 01:36:38.332
- I need to talk to Josephine.
- Well, who doesn't these days?

01:36:38.492 --> 01:36:40.438
She'll be on a plane to Lausanne tonight.

01:36:40.594 --> 01:36:43.541
Nanny's been poisoned. Just like Grandfather.

01:36:43.697 --> 01:36:45.370
- Isn't it exciting?
- Good God.

01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:49.504
Well, aren't you the least bit upset?
I thought you liked Nanny.

01:36:49.670 --> 01:36:51.149
Not particularly.

01:36:51.305 --> 01:36:54.514
She was always scolding me
about something or other. She fussed.

01:36:54.675 --> 01:36:56.621
And I'm sure she stole my notebook.

01:36:56.777 --> 01:37:00.452
Josephine, is there anyone
you're remotely fond of?

01:37:01.148 --> 01:37:04.493
- I love Aunt Edith very much.
- Well, what about us?

01:37:06.687 --> 01:37:07.996
Josephine.

01:37:10.191 --> 01:37:13.297
Excuse me. Won't take a moment.

01:37:16.130 --> 01:37:18.235
Well, what about us?

01:37:19.600 --> 01:37:21.045
Really.

01:37:21.202 --> 01:37:23.978
- You're hurting me!
- Now, Josephine, you and I...

01:37:24.138 --> 01:37:26.243
...we are both solving this case. Aren't we?

01:37:26.407 --> 01:37:28.410
- I haven't got my notebook.
- Don't worry.

01:37:28.809 --> 01:37:32.052
- What exactly do you know?
- I know lots of things.

01:37:32.213 --> 01:37:34.250
Of that I have no doubt.

01:37:34.415 --> 01:37:38.022
But you know who put something
in your hot chocolate, don't you?

01:37:38.185 --> 01:37:40.722
And you know who poisoned your grandfather.

01:37:40.888 --> 01:37:43.494
And you know who cut the ropes
from your tree house.

01:37:43.657 --> 01:37:49.073
Right. Well, now is the time for Holmes
to enlighten not only Watson...

01:37:49.230 --> 01:37:51.676
- ...but Lestrade.
- I shan't tell the police anything.

01:37:51.832 --> 01:37:55.245
They're stupid. They thought
Brenda had done it or Laurence.

01:37:55.402 --> 01:37:58.679
I wasn't stupid like that.
I knew jolly well they hadn't done it.

01:37:58.839 --> 01:38:02.719
I had an idea who it was all along,
and then I made a kind of test.

01:38:02.877 --> 01:38:04.914
- Now I know I'm right.
- You listen to me.

01:38:05.079 --> 01:38:07.855
I daresay you are extremely clever.

01:38:08.015 --> 01:38:11.690
It won't be much good to you if you're
not alive long enough to enjoy the fact.

01:38:11.852 --> 01:38:15.061
Don't you understand, you foolish child,
that so long as you insist...

01:38:15.222 --> 01:38:17.930
...on keeping secrets,
you put yourself in imminent danger?

01:38:18.092 --> 01:38:21.631
Of course I do. But in some books,
person after person is killed.

01:38:21.795 --> 01:38:24.241
You end by spotting the murderer
because he or she...

01:38:24.398 --> 01:38:27.243
...is practically the only person left.
We must see what happens next.

01:38:27.401 --> 01:38:29.574
This isn't a detective story, for chrissake!

01:38:29.737 --> 01:38:31.148
Two people have been murdered.

01:38:31.305 --> 01:38:33.080
I'll make you tell me what you know...

01:38:33.240 --> 01:38:35.220
...if I have to shake you
until your teeth rattle!

01:38:35.376 --> 01:38:37.720
- There you are, Charles.
- Lady Edith.

01:38:38.913 --> 01:38:40.893
We were just having a little chat.

01:38:41.048 --> 01:38:44.325
Of course.
And everybody is a bit tense today...

01:38:44.485 --> 01:38:48.661
...which is quite understandable
under the circumstances.

01:38:48.822 --> 01:38:50.301
Charles...

01:38:50.991 --> 01:38:54.336
...Chief Inspector Taverner
and the coroner are looking for you.

01:38:54.495 --> 01:38:57.408
I understand
they're making significant progress.

01:38:57.564 --> 01:38:59.168
Right, well...

01:38:59.333 --> 01:39:02.405
Don't worry, I'll keep an eye on her.

01:39:02.569 --> 01:39:04.208
- Lady...
- I know, Charles.

01:39:04.605 --> 01:39:05.982
Let me handle this.

01:39:07.007 --> 01:39:08.816
Yes, of course.

01:39:13.747 --> 01:39:15.283
Now...

01:39:16.583 --> 01:39:18.995
...what do you think
about going into Longbridge...

01:39:19.153 --> 01:39:20.962
...and having an ice cream soda?

01:39:21.121 --> 01:39:22.498
Yes.

01:39:31.832 --> 01:39:34.472
I understand you're making progress?

01:39:34.969 --> 01:39:37.677
We'll have to wait for the analysis report.

01:39:37.838 --> 01:39:39.647
You do have a theory, though?

01:39:39.807 --> 01:39:41.309
Well...

01:39:41.475 --> 01:39:44.615
...considering the symptoms,
and the fact that it needs to be...

01:39:44.778 --> 01:39:46.724
...a rather common and accessible poison...

01:39:46.880 --> 01:39:51.022
...my educated guess would be cyanide.

01:39:51.185 --> 01:39:54.462
Why would anyone have cyanide in their house?

01:39:54.621 --> 01:39:58.000
- Apart from killing people, you mean?
- Yeah.

01:39:58.192 --> 01:39:59.967
Moles.

01:40:00.127 --> 01:40:05.008
- Moles?
- Cyanide is used to kill moles.

01:40:25.719 --> 01:40:28.791
Sorry, Lady Edith,
no one is permitted to leave the estate.

01:40:32.326 --> 01:40:34.169
I know.

01:40:34.328 --> 01:40:36.274
But Chief Inspector Taverner has decided...

01:40:36.430 --> 01:40:39.343
...it would be more appropriate
if she were out of the house...

01:40:39.500 --> 01:40:41.275
...for the next hour or so.

01:40:41.435 --> 01:40:44.416
Until the corpse has been removed.

01:40:44.571 --> 01:40:47.848
I mean, he doesn't believe
that a 12-year-old little girl...

01:40:48.008 --> 01:40:51.046
...or a feeble old woman on her last legs
could be the murderers.

01:40:51.211 --> 01:40:53.248
Do you agree, sergeant?

01:40:53.414 --> 01:40:55.587
Sorry. We've all been a bit on edge.

01:40:55.749 --> 01:40:57.353
- I'll get them out the way.
- Of course.

01:40:57.518 --> 01:40:59.930
All right, boys. Move them out the way.

01:41:46.867 --> 01:41:47.902
- Charles?
- Look.

01:41:48.068 --> 01:41:50.173
- What are you doing?
- It's Josephine's diary.

01:41:50.370 --> 01:41:53.351
Edith is trying to destroy it
by burying it in quicklime.

01:41:53.507 --> 01:41:55.384
And there's cyanide up there.

01:41:57.111 --> 01:41:59.751
What? What is it? What?

01:41:59.913 --> 01:42:03.258
Aunt Edith's just left Three Gables.
She took Josephine.

01:42:10.290 --> 01:42:13.669
- That's Aunt Edith's handwriting.
- Get in the car.

01:42:14.828 --> 01:42:17.308
It's so annoying.
I can't find my notebook anywhere.

01:42:17.464 --> 01:42:19.637
You haven't seen it, have you?

01:42:22.903 --> 01:42:24.542
Oh, my darling.

01:42:24.705 --> 01:42:27.311
I love you more than you'll ever know.

01:42:33.814 --> 01:42:35.953
- Has Lady Edith left the estate?
- She left with the little girl.

01:42:36.116 --> 01:42:37.220
- Where?
- That way. Why?

01:42:37.417 --> 01:42:39.954
- Get those damn people out of the way!
- Get out the way!

01:42:40.120 --> 01:42:42.225
Move! Get back! Now.

01:42:49.363 --> 01:42:50.842
What does it say?

01:42:50.998 --> 01:42:53.478
"I, Edith Jane de Haviland,
confess to the murder...

01:42:53.634 --> 01:42:56.012
...of Aristide Leonides."

01:42:57.371 --> 01:42:58.543
God, Josephine.

01:43:06.947 --> 01:43:08.756
Josephine...

01:43:09.082 --> 01:43:10.254
...I have a confession.

01:43:10.951 --> 01:43:12.590
What is it?

01:43:12.753 --> 01:43:15.393
We are not going for ice cream.

01:43:19.326 --> 01:43:21.203
Would you like to know where we're going?

01:43:21.595 --> 01:43:23.370
Well, yes.

01:43:23.530 --> 01:43:27.410
I am taking you to your new ballet lessons.

01:43:28.101 --> 01:43:29.546
Ballet lessons?

01:43:29.703 --> 01:43:31.876
Oh, Aunt Edith.

01:43:33.173 --> 01:43:35.915
But I haven't got my ballet slippers.
Why didn't you say?

01:43:36.910 --> 01:43:41.052
I think they'll have everything we could
possibly want once we get there.

01:43:41.982 --> 01:43:44.553
I wish Grandpapa could see this.

01:43:49.590 --> 01:43:51.900
Why would Aunt Edith want
to kill Grandpapa and Nanny?

01:43:52.059 --> 01:43:53.299
She's not a psychopath.

01:43:53.493 --> 01:43:55.564
- I don't think it was Edith.
- Not Edith?

01:43:55.729 --> 01:43:57.208
Maybe there's something
in Josephine's notebook.

01:43:57.364 --> 01:43:58.502
Read it out loud.

01:44:03.637 --> 01:44:05.276
"I'm so bored.

01:44:05.439 --> 01:44:08.249
Something needs to happen in this house.

01:44:08.408 --> 01:44:09.819
So today I..."

01:44:11.778 --> 01:44:13.382
Oh, my God.

01:44:13.814 --> 01:44:15.316
Go on.

01:44:17.918 --> 01:44:19.454
"So today I...

01:44:19.620 --> 01:44:21.122
- I killed Grandpapa."
<i>- Grandpapa.</i>

01:44:21.288 --> 01:44:22.562
<i>And I enjoyed it very much.</i>

01:44:23.123 --> 01:44:25.228
<i>I certainly had a good reason
to do it though.</i>

01:44:25.392 --> 01:44:27.269
<i>And I warned him.</i>

01:44:27.594 --> 01:44:29.767
<i>I told him he'd be sorry
for stopping my ballet.</i>

01:44:29.930 --> 01:44:32.467
<i>And now I hope he jolly well is.</i>

01:44:32.633 --> 01:44:34.340
<i>He really shouldn't have done that.</i>

01:44:34.534 --> 01:44:37.606
<i>That and other things. Many other things.</i>

01:44:37.771 --> 01:44:39.842
<i>He's mean. Cruel.</i>

01:44:40.040 --> 01:44:41.576
<i>He's a bad person.</i>

01:44:41.742 --> 01:44:43.483
<i>And he thinks he can do anything.</i>

01:44:43.977 --> 01:44:46.082
<i>He thinks he can tell everyone what to do...</i>

01:44:46.246 --> 01:44:48.158
<i>...and make them crazy and miserable.</i>

01:44:48.315 --> 01:44:50.795
<i>But not me. I'm stronger.</i>

01:44:50.951 --> 01:44:53.193
<i>I'm different. I'm like him.</i>

01:44:53.353 --> 01:44:55.663
<i>And I gave him a special treat
for his birthday.</i>

01:44:55.822 --> 01:44:57.597
<i>I did my best dance for him.</i>

01:44:57.758 --> 01:45:00.102
<i>I know how much he likes
watching Brenda dance.</i>

01:45:00.260 --> 01:45:01.967
<i>I can see it from my tree house.</i>

01:45:02.129 --> 01:45:05.508
<i>I also know how much he loved it
when Sophia wanted to be a ballerina.</i>

01:45:05.666 --> 01:45:08.010
<i>He thought she was beautiful and gracious.</i>

01:45:08.168 --> 01:45:11.013
<i>He said there was no point
in me having more ballet lessons...</i>

01:45:11.171 --> 01:45:13.674
<i>...because I would never be good
or gracious enough.</i>

01:45:13.840 --> 01:45:16.719
<i>He said it wasn't so much</i>
Swan Lake <i>as</i> Duck Pond.

01:45:16.877 --> 01:45:18.857
<i>I hate him.</i>

01:45:19.513 --> 01:45:23.359
<i>- I hate him.</i>
- There's a bit about Brenda's letter.

01:45:24.318 --> 01:45:26.321
"I finally got the hang of her handwriting."

01:45:26.486 --> 01:45:29.831
<i>It's lucky she writes like a child of 10.</i>

01:45:29.990 --> 01:45:31.867
<i>I copied it from a bit in</i> Exposure.

01:45:33.960 --> 01:45:37.169
- Is this the right way?
- I believe so.

01:45:38.498 --> 01:45:40.375
<i>Today, I have to be very brave.</i>

01:45:40.801 --> 01:45:45.216
<i>I put Aunt Edith's secateurs
in Laurence's drawer in the school room.</i>

01:45:45.372 --> 01:45:49.047
<i>Now I must climb up
to the tree house with a knife.</i>

01:45:54.681 --> 01:45:57.821
<i>But every task worth doing has a hard bit.</i>

01:46:00.754 --> 01:46:02.597
"Nanny's guessed.

01:46:02.756 --> 01:46:05.327
Eustace kept asking questions,
and I worried he might."

01:46:05.492 --> 01:46:07.563
<i>But he didn't. Nanny did.</i>

01:46:07.728 --> 01:46:10.174
<i>She's snooping around all the time.</i>

01:46:10.330 --> 01:46:12.333
<i>She saw my ballet shoes, which were muddy...</i>

01:46:12.499 --> 01:46:15.537
<i>...after I took secateurs from the shed.
She kept looking at me...</i>

01:46:15.702 --> 01:46:18.706
<i>...and I knew she'd put
two and two together. I hate Nanny.</i>

01:46:18.872 --> 01:46:21.216
<i>Always after me, trying to teach me lessons.</i>

01:46:21.375 --> 01:46:22.718
<i>And she's so stupid.</i>

01:46:22.876 --> 01:46:24.685
<i>I hate stupid people.</i>

01:46:24.845 --> 01:46:29.385
"They're useless, apart from dying
during wars like Grandpapa used to say.

01:46:29.549 --> 01:46:31.756
She should be next."

01:46:31.918 --> 01:46:34.592
Edith must have sensed something...

01:46:35.288 --> 01:46:37.268
...and then she found Josephine's notebook.

01:46:38.558 --> 01:46:40.561
And then Josephine killed Nanny.

01:46:40.727 --> 01:46:42.934
And that's when Edith decided
to blame herself.

01:46:43.096 --> 01:46:46.703
She couldn't let Laurence and Brenda
hang for a crime they hadn't committed.

01:46:46.867 --> 01:46:49.143
But at the same time
she couldn't let Josephine...

01:46:49.302 --> 01:46:53.148
...face a lifetime of institutions,
being jeered at as a monster...

01:46:53.306 --> 01:46:56.651
...laughed at as a freak,
not to mention the public humiliation...

01:46:56.810 --> 01:47:01.316
- ...the house would have had to endure.
- What is she doing with Josephine?

01:47:04.451 --> 01:47:06.090
There they are.

01:47:14.761 --> 01:47:16.707
Why this way?

01:47:17.230 --> 01:47:18.470
It's a shortcut.

01:47:18.632 --> 01:47:21.203
It's the road that leads to the quarry.
I don't understand.

01:47:32.913 --> 01:47:35.359
Aunt Edith, what is this?

01:47:35.515 --> 01:47:37.586
- You're frightening me.
- Don't be frightened.

01:47:43.990 --> 01:47:46.994
Aunt Edith, what are you doing?

01:47:48.161 --> 01:47:50.300
Aunt Edith!

01:48:00.941 --> 01:48:02.443
Oh, my God, Charles. They're...

01:48:02.609 --> 01:48:05.146
Aunt Edith, stop! Stop!

01:48:05.312 --> 01:48:07.519
- No, no!
- Stop!

01:48:09.816 --> 01:48:12.524
Stop the car, stop the car, stop the car.

01:48:22.796 --> 01:48:23.968
- No, no, no.
- No.

01:48:28.702 --> 01:48:30.477
No, no, no.

01:48:44.184 --> 01:48:46.596
What did we do to her?

01:48:46.786 --> 01:48:48.766
- What did we do to her?!
- No, no, it's okay.

01:48:48.922 --> 01:48:51.869
It wasn't you. It wasn't you.

01:48:53.193 --> 01:48:54.866
It wasn't you.
