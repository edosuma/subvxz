00:47.214 --> 00:51.175
"I lay on my pillow
at the Sherry-Netherland Hotel.

00:51.260 --> 00:54.303
"Delicious and destroyed.

00:54.388 --> 00:58.057
"Inhaling the fragrance of the sheets.

00:58.142 --> 01:02.311
"Feeling the warmth of where
you were just laying.

01:02.396 --> 01:05.022
"You make me new with laughter.

01:05.107 --> 01:07.525
"You make me old with wisdom.

01:08.986 --> 01:11.070
You make wine taste sweeter."

01:12.573 --> 01:13.948
Who wrote that?

01:15.451 --> 01:18.995
I write a lot of poetry when I'm inspired.

01:24.251 --> 01:27.837
I guess I shouldn't be surprised
by anything you do.

01:27.921 --> 01:29.380
You shouldn't.

01:30.883 --> 01:32.300
It's insulting.

01:35.512 --> 01:39.182
I have to keep you in line,
or I'll lose you.

01:39.266 --> 01:40.850
Yes, you will.

01:43.187 --> 01:45.480
I don't like the idea of making you older.

01:47.983 --> 01:50.109
I just meant...

01:52.988 --> 01:54.447
I don't know.

02:01.455 --> 02:04.999
It doesn't matter how old l am.

02:05.125 --> 02:07.168
Our souls are the same age.

02:22.976 --> 02:24.352
Oh, God.

02:27.022 --> 02:28.773
You're getting to me.

02:35.322 --> 02:38.658
How do I know I'm not just
going to eat another mushroom

02:38.742 --> 02:42.995
and this room will disappear
and I'll be back on a train to Trenton?

02:43.080 --> 02:45.957
Because l love you, Jane.

02:50.379 --> 02:53.506
This is hard for you. I know it.

02:56.510 --> 02:57.969
You don't want me to talk about it,

02:58.053 --> 03:03.432
but Margaret and Mona have been
your life for the last 40 years.

03:03.517 --> 03:05.393
30.

03:07.396 --> 03:10.982
Listen, I'm not being impulsive,

03:11.066 --> 03:14.026
because I've been thinking
about this all the time.

03:16.113 --> 03:18.406
I want you to be my wife.

03:19.449 --> 03:20.449
What?

03:22.244 --> 03:23.369
Marry me.

03:25.247 --> 03:26.831
Roger, are you serious?

03:26.915 --> 03:28.708
Will you do that for me?

03:43.640 --> 03:46.767
90% of Right Guard users
say they play sports.

03:46.852 --> 03:48.978
60% wear it for their girls as well.

03:49.062 --> 03:53.149
Most impressive, 80% of the fellas
saying "yes" to the question:

03:53.233 --> 03:55.985
"Does Right Guard make you
feel more confident at work?"

03:56.069 --> 03:58.321
Did anyone watch Loretta Young last night?

03:58.405 --> 03:59.864
I was supposed to. What happened?

03:59.948 --> 04:02.617
I can't even describe it, it was so awful.

04:02.701 --> 04:07.163
Creative, think old Donnie Draper will mind
if we think better on a full stomach?

04:08.874 --> 04:10.791
Well, if you'lI all swear
Gillette dropped in.

04:10.876 --> 04:12.585
Are you kidding?

04:12.669 --> 04:14.295
Absolutely.

04:14.379 --> 04:16.422
I'll pretend they're here if you give me
some actual ideas.

04:16.506 --> 04:18.841
Right Guard already has
a great campaign--

04:18.926 --> 04:20.134
men being men.

04:20.260 --> 04:21.969
You know, women smell bad, too.

04:22.054 --> 04:23.262
Not you, of course.

04:23.347 --> 04:24.639
Women haνe perfume.

04:24.723 --> 04:27.099
"Perfume does not fight wetness."

04:27.184 --> 04:29.977
Loretta Young.
She's my dad's favorite.

04:30.062 --> 04:31.270
The aprons.

04:31.355 --> 04:33.814
The nauseating upholstery on the couch.

04:33.899 --> 04:35.733
Strangers who drop by.

04:35.817 --> 04:36.859
Hear from Kinsey?

04:36.944 --> 04:38.319
What do you mean?

04:38.403 --> 04:39.946
Did you read what's going on down there?

04:40.030 --> 04:41.614
In this day and age.

04:41.698 --> 04:43.908
The papers said it's gonna be
Little Rock all over again.

04:43.992 --> 04:46.535
I don't know why people
keep stirring up trouble.

04:46.620 --> 04:47.870
It's bad for business.

04:47.955 --> 04:49.205
Just another reason not to watch TV.

04:49.289 --> 04:50.748
Kurt doesn't even have one.

04:50.832 --> 04:52.500
You have to have one. It's your job.

04:52.584 --> 04:53.793
You're gonna miss the playoff.

04:55.379 --> 04:56.796
It's a different life for single men.

04:56.880 --> 04:59.048
What do you do with your spare time?

04:59.132 --> 05:01.300
I like concerts. I like park.

05:01.385 --> 05:03.219
He saw Bob Dylan at Carnegie Hall.

05:03.303 --> 05:05.096
I heard him on the radio.

05:05.180 --> 05:07.473
So we're not gonna work at all.

05:09.017 --> 05:11.894
Tell Right Guard,
short of a new product just for women,

05:11.979 --> 05:13.270
we need more research and time.

05:13.355 --> 05:14.438
And lunch.

05:16.608 --> 05:18.609
Can we split a lobster?

05:25.742 --> 05:27.785
Does he sound like the album?

05:27.869 --> 05:30.788
When you hear him, he plays it himself.

05:30.872 --> 05:32.999
He must be something to see.

05:33.083 --> 05:34.291
I'd love to go sometime.

05:34.376 --> 05:35.751
So go.

05:35.836 --> 05:37.253
Yes, I shouId.

05:37.337 --> 05:38.838
You will go with me.

05:38.922 --> 05:40.423
What?

05:40.507 --> 05:42.800
You would go with me?

05:42.884 --> 05:47.221
No. l don't want to impose
if you haνe plans.

05:47.347 --> 05:51.600
When you hear him, you will smile like this.

05:53.812 --> 05:55.104
Pick you up at 8.

05:55.188 --> 05:56.856
I live in Brooklyn. It's a hike.

05:56.940 --> 05:58.733
Neighbors.

06:00.360 --> 06:02.153
Joey says that Duck's in the blind.

06:02.237 --> 06:03.529
It's now or never.

06:24.760 --> 06:27.803
This is why l booked a day early.

06:27.888 --> 06:29.764
What did Ricardo in there say?

06:29.848 --> 06:31.974
He's in hourly contact with TWA,

06:32.059 --> 06:34.143
and they've offered
to buy you new luggage.

06:34.227 --> 06:35.978
And fill it with my things?

06:36.063 --> 06:39.440
Ricardo recommended a tailor. Chinese.

06:39.524 --> 06:43.277
And he said they've got
a whole shop full of swim trunks.

06:43.403 --> 06:45.237
I brought mine.

06:45.322 --> 06:47.573
There's not gonna be any swimming.

06:47.657 --> 06:50.576
The convention doesn't
start for another day.

06:50.660 --> 06:51.744
You want to be the hundredth person

06:51.828 --> 06:53.329
to shake someone's hand
at some convention?

06:53.413 --> 06:54.997
For what, a free pen?

06:55.082 --> 06:57.083
We'll follow up face to face.

06:57.167 --> 06:59.335
Forget Santa Monica.

06:59.419 --> 07:01.504
Take your list,
target some of these guys,

07:01.588 --> 07:03.297
and make them feel special.

07:03.423 --> 07:05.466
Didn't Roger give you leads?

07:05.550 --> 07:06.717
He did.

07:07.928 --> 07:09.512
I'm gonna need sunglasses.

07:14.059 --> 07:15.851
Come on.

07:15.936 --> 07:17.436
You want to be on vacation, Pete?

07:17.521 --> 07:19.146
Because I can make that happen.

08:09.823 --> 08:11.198
Old-fashioned.

08:14.578 --> 08:15.744
Excuse me.

08:17.080 --> 08:19.748
My friends and I have
been speculating about you,

08:19.833 --> 08:22.668
trying to decide who you are
and what you do.

08:22.752 --> 08:24.211
Why?

08:24.296 --> 08:26.088
Are you an actor?

08:26.173 --> 08:27.298
No.

08:27.382 --> 08:29.008
Are you an astronaut?

08:29.092 --> 08:30.176
No.

08:30.260 --> 08:32.219
Someone over there
would like to meet you--

08:32.304 --> 08:34.138
a young woman--

08:34.222 --> 08:36.807
only if you are none of these things.

08:41.188 --> 08:43.939
I'm Viscount Monteforte d'Alsace.

08:44.024 --> 08:45.774
- Willy.
- Don.

08:45.859 --> 08:48.152
This is Don.

08:48.236 --> 08:50.821
She's been staring at you all day.

08:50.906 --> 08:53.199
Can't stop talking about you.

08:54.367 --> 08:55.367
I'm Joy.

08:58.872 --> 09:01.582
And this is Rocci.

09:01.666 --> 09:05.836
You look so comfortable
alone by the pool all day.

09:05.921 --> 09:08.380
Made me wonder if you're
waiting for someone.

09:10.300 --> 09:11.967
I am.

09:13.094 --> 09:15.429
Do you smell that jasmine?

09:17.057 --> 09:18.265
Dine with us.

09:20.560 --> 09:21.810
Maybe another time.

09:21.895 --> 09:24.355
That never happens.

09:24.439 --> 09:25.773
Hello.

09:25.857 --> 09:28.234
Pete, this is Joy and Rocci

09:28.318 --> 09:30.277
and Viscount Monteforte.

09:30.362 --> 09:31.612
Very good.

09:31.696 --> 09:33.322
D'Alsace. Willy.

09:33.406 --> 09:35.032
That's quite a name.

09:35.116 --> 09:36.659
Peter Dykeman Campbell.

09:36.743 --> 09:38.744
Have we met somewhere? Newport?

09:38.828 --> 09:42.039
I have a terrible memory for faces.

09:42.123 --> 09:43.374
Nice meeting you.

09:43.458 --> 09:44.625
Yes.

09:44.709 --> 09:45.960
A pleasure to meet you.

09:49.839 --> 09:51.340
Look for us.

09:57.430 --> 10:00.557
Everybody here is late for everything.

10:00.642 --> 10:03.394
I just saw Tony Curtis in the men's room.

10:03.478 --> 10:05.562
Handing out towels?

10:05.647 --> 10:07.606
Tony Curtis, Don.

10:07.691 --> 10:09.358
A thing like that.

10:12.946 --> 10:14.530
Who's for dinner?

10:14.614 --> 10:15.698
Rodney Barnes.

10:15.782 --> 10:17.533
Classic salesman turned executive.

10:17.617 --> 10:20.911
And this interesting scientist,
Caleb Sawyer.

10:20.996 --> 10:23.414
He has this Optoman thesis.

10:23.498 --> 10:25.207
In addition to rockets,

10:25.292 --> 10:27.376
they're going to start engineering man--

10:27.460 --> 10:29.211
you know, for travel in space.

10:29.296 --> 10:32.589
New organs, super strength.

10:32.674 --> 10:34.633
You know the Soviets are working on it.

10:34.718 --> 10:37.011
Are all of our meetings like this?

10:37.095 --> 10:39.638
It's American Aviation and Rocketdyne.

10:39.723 --> 10:40.889
It's not a joke.

10:42.517 --> 10:44.518
Can I get a drink here or what?

10:55.196 --> 10:56.739
The Raphael was a little tired,

10:56.823 --> 11:00.242
but the Fifth Arrondissement
has most of your good restaurants.

11:00.327 --> 11:01.660
Of course, we kept getting lost,

11:01.745 --> 11:03.287
and every time Sherry asked for directions,

11:03.371 --> 11:05.414
it turned out to be another American.

11:05.498 --> 11:06.874
Well, there you go.

11:06.958 --> 11:10.252
I'll take Jane to Paris,
and I'll send Mona to Reno.

11:10.337 --> 11:11.754
You don't have to marry her, do you?

11:11.838 --> 11:13.505
No.

11:13.590 --> 11:17.217
Maybe you and Mona could work out
one of those modern arrangements.

11:17.302 --> 11:18.719
George, stop.

11:18.803 --> 11:22.348
It is possible that you'll get tired of her,
and then where will you be?

11:22.432 --> 11:24.224
Mona doesn't haνe a right to anything--

11:24.309 --> 11:26.226
not my company money,
not my family money.

11:26.311 --> 11:28.354
She's lucky I'm giving her anything.

11:28.438 --> 11:30.439
And you know what?
We've been miserable for years.

11:30.523 --> 11:32.107
I don't want to die with that woman.

11:32.192 --> 11:33.650
Calm down.

11:33.735 --> 11:36.570
I didn't know that.

11:36.696 --> 11:39.698
This is the life I was always meant to haνe.

11:41.201 --> 11:42.785
Congratulations.

11:44.579 --> 11:47.331
Mona has the marriage license,
and she wants to hurt you.

11:47.415 --> 11:50.125
If you want to be with this 20-year-old girl,
you're going to have to buy it from her.

11:50.210 --> 11:51.418
I have to warn you.

11:51.503 --> 11:55.089
Women in this situation
become extra irrational.

11:55.173 --> 11:56.632
Well, how badly
does she want to hurt me?

11:56.716 --> 11:58.342
I have a list of conditions

11:58.426 --> 12:01.345
and an alimony that could
support Rita Hayworth.

12:01.429 --> 12:03.847
Think of all the good things
in life and cut them in half.

12:03.932 --> 12:07.017
l want you to push as hard
as you can, but I want it done.

12:07.102 --> 12:09.353
Mr. Phillips is here.

12:09.437 --> 12:10.896
In a minute.

12:12.565 --> 12:13.941
I'll proceed.

12:14.025 --> 12:17.236
But I want you to think about it.

12:19.322 --> 12:21.281
Duck Phillips, this is George Rothman.

12:21.366 --> 12:23.450
Actually, we know each other.

12:24.577 --> 12:26.328
Roger.

12:26.413 --> 12:27.996
It's good to see you, Duck.

12:43.221 --> 12:44.596
Was he for you or against you?

12:44.681 --> 12:46.181
He's supposed to be the best.

12:46.266 --> 12:47.307
Him or Marvin Hughes.

12:47.392 --> 12:49.309
That's who Mona has.

12:49.394 --> 12:50.769
He's her cousin.

12:52.480 --> 12:54.773
How bad was it? Do I want to know?

12:54.858 --> 12:57.860
I don't think my circumstances
were the same as yours.

13:05.702 --> 13:06.743
What can I do for you?

13:06.828 --> 13:09.329
Actually, this might not be
the best time to talk about this.

13:09.414 --> 13:11.248
Can't you tell I'd welcome
a change in subject?

13:11.332 --> 13:13.167
Well, good, then.

13:14.627 --> 13:16.253
What the hell, right?

13:19.215 --> 13:22.009
Listen, we're coming up
on two years together here.

13:23.136 --> 13:24.428
Did you get me something?

13:28.391 --> 13:32.853
I think we're at a point in time
where I need to know what your plans are.

13:32.937 --> 13:35.606
A partnership. I think I'νe earned it.

13:37.650 --> 13:38.859
Right.

13:40.487 --> 13:43.947
I'll bring it up at the next meeting
of the partners.

13:44.032 --> 13:45.741
Thank you.

13:45.825 --> 13:48.785
Of course you might have to come in
and be an advocate for yourself.

13:48.870 --> 13:50.370
I'd be proud to present
my accomplishments.

13:50.455 --> 13:52.748
Good. Because I'm at a loss.

13:54.000 --> 13:55.709
What is that supposed to mean?

13:55.835 --> 13:58.670
You haven't exactly deliνered
on that 30% you promised.

14:00.507 --> 14:02.841
I think we've really performed
in a very dismal year.

14:02.926 --> 14:05.010
These things are cyclical. You know that.

14:08.515 --> 14:10.974
Is there some question
about my value to Sterling Cooper?

14:11.059 --> 14:12.226
Just think about the board.

14:12.310 --> 14:13.977
Bert Cooper hates everyone.

14:14.062 --> 14:15.562
And his sister--

14:15.647 --> 14:17.731
well, she does whatever he says.

14:17.857 --> 14:20.526
Don, he's only 12 1/2%,

14:20.610 --> 14:23.570
but l can't say he's
your biggest cheerleader.

14:23.655 --> 14:25.072
What are you saying?

14:25.156 --> 14:26.698
Everyone thinks you're a fine fellow.

14:26.783 --> 14:31.286
But if I were you,
I'd go out there and make rain.

14:34.958 --> 14:37.292
Thank you for being so candid.

14:41.798 --> 14:44.550
This year we have seen
an historic collaboration

14:44.634 --> 14:46.093
in American aerospace.

14:46.177 --> 14:48.470
Building on Lockheed's new Polaris A3,

14:48.555 --> 14:50.055
Bell Aerosystems,

14:50.139 --> 14:51.765
Aerojet General, and NASA

14:51.891 --> 14:54.059
have developed a restartable rocket engine.

14:54.143 --> 14:56.395
Can we get the lights, please?

14:59.482 --> 15:01.316
We at Space Technology Laboratories

15:01.401 --> 15:05.487
have set our minds
to the challenges of the future.

15:05.572 --> 15:09.741
In July, Khrushcheν said the Soviet Union
now has an anti-missile

15:09.826 --> 15:12.327
that can hit a fly in outer space.

15:12.412 --> 15:16.415
Space Technology Laboratories
is leading a coordinated effort

15:16.499 --> 15:18.417
to create an invulnerable warhead--

15:18.501 --> 15:20.836
multiple, independently targetable

15:20.920 --> 15:22.921
reentry vehicles-- M.I.R.V.s.

15:23.006 --> 15:25.591
And North American Aνiation's
vernier thruster

15:25.675 --> 15:28.302
allows the primary missile
to correct its trajectory

15:28.386 --> 15:32.598
before shooting off several warheads
hidden inside its nose cone.

15:32.682 --> 15:34.683
The M.I.R.V. can be launched

15:34.767 --> 15:37.185
from a submarine or land
into the stratosphere.

15:39.272 --> 15:42.065
Then it splits off
into 14 individual warheads.

15:42.150 --> 15:44.735
That's 14 different targets.

15:46.237 --> 15:47.863
14 different cities.

15:47.947 --> 15:50.198
14 individual warheads,

15:50.283 --> 15:52.701
each with ten times
the payload of Nagasaki.

15:53.786 --> 15:56.955
Even if Khrushchev hits 35%,

15:57.040 --> 15:59.291
that's 5 out of 14.

15:59.375 --> 16:04.171
Secondary strike capabilities
will be extremely limited

16:04.255 --> 16:08.592
due to the decrease
in infrastructure and population.

16:10.637 --> 16:12.429
Total annihilation.

16:18.144 --> 16:20.270
Do you realize that one
of these companies

16:20.355 --> 16:23.398
spends more annually on media
than three Lucky Strikes?

16:23.483 --> 16:25.442
It's a gold rush.

16:27.570 --> 16:29.571
Where are the valets?

16:29.656 --> 16:31.365
So much for cheap labor.

16:31.449 --> 16:33.367
Go see if General Dynamics beat us here.

16:33.451 --> 16:35.077
Drop these by the front desk.

16:35.161 --> 16:37.162
You don't want them under your arm.

17:00.186 --> 17:01.436
Hello.

17:01.521 --> 17:03.855
I think you're happy to see me.

17:07.694 --> 17:10.278
Well, take a good look.
I have to be on my way.

17:10.363 --> 17:11.613
Are you working?

17:11.698 --> 17:14.074
Yes.

17:14.158 --> 17:15.909
That's too bad.

17:16.035 --> 17:17.744
I'm going to Palm Springs.

17:17.829 --> 17:19.496
You should come with me.

17:20.957 --> 17:22.666
I don't know about that.

17:25.795 --> 17:28.463
Why would you deny yourself
something you want?

18:06.919 --> 18:08.879
You want to get your things?

18:10.089 --> 18:11.256
No.

18:20.850 --> 18:22.476
Well.

18:22.560 --> 18:23.935
Why don't we give it a few more minutes?

18:24.020 --> 18:28.356
Enjoy the scenery, order some drinks.

18:28.441 --> 18:30.942
I think Don needed to make a phone call.

18:44.040 --> 18:45.457
Hello?

18:46.584 --> 18:48.001
Just leave the bags there.

18:51.798 --> 18:52.881
Who lives here?

18:52.965 --> 18:56.301
Friends. They're in Sardinia.

18:56.385 --> 18:58.178
I'm supposed to be in Edward's room.

19:11.317 --> 19:13.693
That's Stephanie in the swimming pool.

19:15.363 --> 19:17.489
And Willy and Rocci you've met.

19:20.034 --> 19:22.536
And there's Greta and her friend Carlos.

19:22.620 --> 19:25.163
I'm surprised to see them
in the same place.

19:27.834 --> 19:29.167
Come with me.

19:34.841 --> 19:36.091
Hello, Greta.

19:36.175 --> 19:38.593
Hello, Joy, darling.

19:39.846 --> 19:41.096
Who's this?

19:41.180 --> 19:43.098
This is my friend Don.

19:43.182 --> 19:45.559
I'm Carlos Villa Declan.

19:48.187 --> 19:49.980
It's medicinal.

19:56.320 --> 19:58.071
Good-bye, Carlos.

20:04.453 --> 20:06.413
Come for a swim with me?

20:10.668 --> 20:12.544
You can go inside
and ask for some trunks,

20:12.628 --> 20:14.504
or you can go au naturel.

20:19.260 --> 20:22.470
I think I should go inside.

20:22.555 --> 20:25.223
You're white as a sheet.

20:26.976 --> 20:28.727
Don, are you okay?

20:51.959 --> 20:53.168
Where am l?

20:53.252 --> 20:55.587
You're with me, remember?

20:55.671 --> 20:58.632
You have heat exhaustion.

20:58.716 --> 21:00.592
What are you doing?

21:00.676 --> 21:02.093
It's fine. It's medicine.

21:02.178 --> 21:03.803
Klaus is a doctor.

21:05.264 --> 21:06.556
No, it's okay.

21:06.641 --> 21:08.308
I just need some water and some aspirin.

21:11.103 --> 21:12.145
Everybody out.

21:12.271 --> 21:14.522
I thought you were going
to break your neck.

21:14.607 --> 21:18.193
Next time you feel faint,
lean towards the pool.

21:18.277 --> 21:19.819
See you at dinner.

21:19.904 --> 21:22.656
Little girl, don't get any ideas.

21:22.740 --> 21:24.741
This man needs rest.

21:27.870 --> 21:29.996
I found you some clothes upstairs.

21:35.586 --> 21:37.712
Who are these people?

21:38.756 --> 21:40.006
They're friends.

21:43.928 --> 21:45.929
We're nomads together.

21:46.013 --> 21:48.056
What are you all doing here?

21:48.140 --> 21:51.309
There's an open door policy.

21:51.394 --> 21:53.103
You should rest up for dinner.

21:53.187 --> 21:54.521
Have you eνer had Mexican food?

21:54.605 --> 21:55.897
No.

21:55.982 --> 21:57.148
You're gonna like it.

21:57.233 --> 21:58.900
Come out when you're ready.

22:18.921 --> 22:20.922
You're spoiled.

22:21.007 --> 22:22.632
This is great food. This is Mexican.

22:22.717 --> 22:25.051
I don't like Mexican.
I want to do French again.

22:25.136 --> 22:27.137
We're in Califor-- Sweetheart.

22:27.221 --> 22:28.555
Mexican does pig. l don't eat pig.

22:28.639 --> 22:32.017
- I've already told you.
- Okay, well...

22:36.188 --> 22:39.649
- He's here.
- Don.

22:44.530 --> 22:46.990
Klaus, could you let Don sit here?

22:58.502 --> 22:59.753
Would you like some wine, Don?

22:59.837 --> 23:01.755
Klaus, is that okay?

23:01.839 --> 23:03.923
He looks healthy enough.

23:04.008 --> 23:06.342
You must be hungry.

23:06.427 --> 23:09.679
Everyone, to our guest.

23:10.890 --> 23:13.600
To not being carried out in a box.

23:19.857 --> 23:21.691
So, Don, what's your story?

23:23.611 --> 23:25.320
I don't know how to answer that.

23:25.404 --> 23:27.238
Where are you from?

23:28.949 --> 23:30.158
New York.

23:30.242 --> 23:31.409
Try this.

23:31.494 --> 23:33.286
It's a pepper filled with cheese.

23:33.412 --> 23:34.454
Darling.

23:34.538 --> 23:35.747
And there's the sauce.

23:37.124 --> 23:39.084
Joy and Willy think that you're a spy.

23:39.168 --> 23:42.170
But your wallet fell out
when they carried you inside.

23:42.254 --> 23:43.755
You're in adνertising.

23:43.839 --> 23:45.340
Or l'm a really good spy.

23:49.929 --> 23:52.847
You'll never meet a group of people
more interested in professions,

23:52.932 --> 23:56.392
and yet, there is not
one of us here who has one.

23:56.477 --> 23:57.602
I'm a physician.

23:57.686 --> 23:59.896
But you don't work.

24:01.023 --> 24:02.649
So I assume you're all well off.

24:07.488 --> 24:09.697
I should take something up.

24:09.782 --> 24:12.200
I'm smarter than I've ever been in my life.

24:12.284 --> 24:17.997
Not only do I know so much,
but my brain is more agile.

24:18.082 --> 24:19.541
I didn't know that was possible.

24:19.625 --> 24:23.128
And my muscles are
remembering their skills.

24:23.212 --> 24:24.546
Are you an athlete, Don?

24:26.298 --> 24:27.549
I played some football in high school.

24:27.633 --> 24:31.177
Willy was a champion fencer.

24:31.262 --> 24:34.180
I made the Olympic team twice.

24:34.265 --> 24:38.434
1 948, London. 1 952, Helsinki.

24:38.519 --> 24:39.769
Foils.

24:39.854 --> 24:42.605
It's hardly a sport.

24:48.028 --> 24:49.863
Let's play places.

24:49.947 --> 24:51.573
I'll start.

24:51.657 --> 24:53.741
You have to name a place

24:53.826 --> 24:56.578
that starts with the last letter
of the place that's named.

24:59.165 --> 25:00.498
Kalambaka.

25:00.583 --> 25:02.000
Alaska.

25:02.084 --> 25:03.918
It's not a city.

25:04.003 --> 25:05.503
Amalfi.

25:05.588 --> 25:07.046
Irún.

25:07.131 --> 25:08.298
Naples.

25:08.382 --> 25:09.841
- Stockholm.
- Malagá.

25:09.925 --> 25:12.510
Athens.

25:12.595 --> 25:13.928
Sarajevo.

25:14.013 --> 25:15.180
Oslo.

25:16.932 --> 25:18.141
Wow.

25:18.225 --> 25:19.350
"O" is impossible.

25:19.435 --> 25:20.643
Odessa.

25:20.728 --> 25:23.813
- Orezzo.
- Osaka.

25:23.898 --> 25:25.148
Oakland.

25:25.232 --> 25:26.733
Dunkirk.

25:26.817 --> 25:27.942
Kabul.

25:28.027 --> 25:29.027
London.

25:29.111 --> 25:30.570
- Nice.
- Essen.

25:30.654 --> 25:31.571
Nairobi.

25:32.990 --> 25:34.657
Istanbul.

25:34.742 --> 25:35.742
Lisbon.

25:36.827 --> 25:38.828
Negril.

25:38.913 --> 25:40.371
Lauzon.

26:05.689 --> 26:06.940
How old are you?

26:07.024 --> 26:08.733
I'm 21 .

26:08.817 --> 26:10.401
How old are you?

26:10.486 --> 26:13.071
I'm 36.

26:19.662 --> 26:21.829
You're still warm.

26:23.999 --> 26:26.501
Who are you?

26:26.585 --> 26:28.962
I'm Joy.

27:20.723 --> 27:22.307
There's glazed.

27:23.976 --> 27:25.977
Coconut, crullers.

27:27.896 --> 27:29.397
Bismarks.

27:29.481 --> 27:30.690
Who brought these in, Cosgroνe?

27:30.774 --> 27:33.568
I haven't seen contracts,
but this is certainly a good sign.

27:33.652 --> 27:35.486
Gosh, Joan, thank him for me.

27:36.822 --> 27:38.573
We're going to be getting
a delivery like this

27:38.657 --> 27:40.283
every week, with all the νarieties.

27:40.367 --> 27:42.660
Lemonaires.

27:43.996 --> 27:45.246
Are these for us?

27:45.331 --> 27:46.914
The spoils of victory.

27:46.999 --> 27:48.583
8:00 in this evening.

27:48.667 --> 27:49.792
Excuse me?

27:49.877 --> 27:51.210
Our destination.

27:51.295 --> 27:52.587
Okay.

27:52.671 --> 27:53.963
Where are you two going?

27:54.048 --> 27:55.465
To the Bob Dylan.

27:55.549 --> 27:57.300
Isn't that interesting?

27:57.384 --> 27:59.510
Peggy and Kurt in the Village, oh, my.

28:01.055 --> 28:02.805
Don't be shy.

28:02.890 --> 28:05.433
I think you two are adorable.

28:06.935 --> 28:08.895
What is with this?

28:08.979 --> 28:10.897
You think Peggy and I?

28:10.981 --> 28:12.190
We do.

28:13.400 --> 28:15.693
I'm homosexual.

28:18.072 --> 28:20.156
I don't think that means
what you think it means.

28:20.240 --> 28:21.783
Kurt.

28:21.867 --> 28:25.703
No. I make love with the man,
not the woman.

28:30.376 --> 28:31.626
What?

28:35.172 --> 28:37.048
8?

28:38.384 --> 28:40.468
Of course. Absolutely.

28:54.483 --> 28:56.651
Enjoy the dancing beans.

28:58.112 --> 28:59.487
Did you know about this?

29:00.614 --> 29:03.324
He's from Europe. It's different there.

29:03.409 --> 29:04.700
More for me.

29:04.785 --> 29:06.953
So Kurt is a pervert.

29:07.037 --> 29:08.955
How about that?

29:09.039 --> 29:10.373
He certainly had me fooled.

29:10.457 --> 29:13.418
Mr. Cosgroνe, do you want me
to invite the girls in?

29:13.502 --> 29:15.336
I knew queers existed.

29:15.421 --> 29:16.671
I just don't want to work with them.

29:16.755 --> 29:20.258
What, he's the first homo
you ever met in adνertising?

29:23.929 --> 29:25.388
You think Smitty's in loνe?

29:26.598 --> 29:29.350
Which bathroom does he use?

29:29.435 --> 29:31.269
Joan, get the girls in here.

29:40.195 --> 29:41.863
What are you reading?

29:41.947 --> 29:44.782
William Faulkner.

29:47.703 --> 29:51.414
I took a survey of American literature.

29:51.498 --> 29:52.957
So you're in school?

29:53.041 --> 29:55.334
I was at Pembroke.

29:55.419 --> 29:59.839
Willy has a house in Rhode Island,
so it seemed conνenient.

29:59.923 --> 30:01.591
Didn't fit.

30:03.302 --> 30:04.552
Is it good?

30:04.636 --> 30:05.970
Sex is good.

30:06.054 --> 30:07.972
This book is just okay.

30:09.808 --> 30:11.476
I like sex.

30:14.229 --> 30:16.647
You do, too. I can tell.

30:24.656 --> 30:26.324
Greta and Carlos are arguing.

30:28.660 --> 30:30.912
I knew they had problems.

30:30.996 --> 30:32.622
Greta has.

30:32.706 --> 30:34.332
Carlos never had any.

30:36.710 --> 30:41.464
Good morning.

30:41.548 --> 30:42.798
Do you hear them in there?

30:42.883 --> 30:46.219
The humiliations have been spectacular.

30:48.055 --> 30:49.889
Christian is coming with the children.

30:49.973 --> 30:51.933
I hope you don't mind.

30:52.017 --> 30:55.186
No matter how late I show up,
I'm never later than Christian.

30:58.732 --> 31:00.816
Look at him.

31:00.901 --> 31:04.320
You are so beautiful.

31:08.283 --> 31:09.784
You are a brat.

31:09.868 --> 31:11.452
She has her mother's temperament.

31:11.537 --> 31:13.538
That's why you loνe me.

31:16.667 --> 31:18.793
I make beautiful babies, don't I?

31:20.504 --> 31:22.088
I'll see you outside.

31:24.758 --> 31:26.717
That's your father?

31:28.512 --> 31:31.097
He doesn't want people to think he's old.

31:36.436 --> 31:38.688
Yes, it's Peter Campbell
from Sterling Cooper

31:38.772 --> 31:40.147
for Clarence Hastings.

31:40.232 --> 31:41.899
Is there any way we can meet here?

31:41.984 --> 31:44.652
I can't driνe, and there doesn't
seem to be a taxi

31:44.736 --> 31:46.612
that will take me to Pasadena.

31:48.073 --> 31:49.615
We can meet by the pool.

32:00.335 --> 32:03.170
Thank you. How are you two today?

32:10.429 --> 32:12.638
Duck Phillips.

32:12.723 --> 32:14.223
Saint John Powell, how are you?

32:14.308 --> 32:15.975
Capital, capital.

32:16.059 --> 32:17.518
This is Alec Martin.

32:17.603 --> 32:18.936
Duck Phillips.

32:22.941 --> 32:24.442
By Jove, man, catch up.

32:24.526 --> 32:27.194
I have a bit of a cold.

32:27.279 --> 32:28.738
Well, it's warm already.

32:28.822 --> 32:30.072
It'll open up the passages.

32:30.157 --> 32:31.949
It's warm, or he would have drunk it.

32:34.077 --> 32:36.329
So, how are you finding New York?

32:36.413 --> 32:37.705
Brief.

32:37.789 --> 32:40.291
We're going to visit
a candy plant for Cadbury.

32:40.375 --> 32:41.876
Then it's fate that l caught you here.

32:41.960 --> 32:43.336
You say fate.

32:44.463 --> 32:46.130
I say another round, garçon.

32:46.840 --> 32:48.174
Have mine.

32:53.263 --> 32:55.139
If you're not drinking, what's this about?

32:57.643 --> 33:00.561
I keep thinking how I miss
doing things your way.

33:03.190 --> 33:05.566
Two years ago, you said
you wanted to come here

33:05.651 --> 33:06.942
and be with your children.

33:07.027 --> 33:08.986
They're grown.

33:12.115 --> 33:14.909
It's not a good time.

33:14.993 --> 33:16.702
I'm not going to take no for an answer.

33:16.787 --> 33:18.746
I wouldn't expect you to.

33:20.999 --> 33:25.920
You know, if we were hiring,
you would be at the top of our list.

33:28.215 --> 33:30.007
That's too bad.

33:30.092 --> 33:32.426
I loνe you New York ad men.

33:37.933 --> 33:39.684
To our noble profession.

33:56.702 --> 33:59.453
How old are your children?

33:59.538 --> 34:02.915
Alec's wife is about to have their first.

34:04.710 --> 34:07.378
Do you think that I have
nothing to offer you?

34:10.841 --> 34:11.966
No, of course not.

34:12.050 --> 34:14.468
You represent
over 20 American companies,

34:14.553 --> 34:16.470
doing business in Europe.

34:16.555 --> 34:19.140
I know you want a U.S. presence.

34:19.224 --> 34:22.601
You're wasting your time doing things
like digging around here for Cadbury.

34:22.686 --> 34:24.770
And you could make a difference?

34:24.855 --> 34:28.107
What if I were to bring you
every account at Sterling Cooper?

34:28.191 --> 34:30.192
Fully serviced and completely satisfied?

34:32.446 --> 34:33.863
What are you talking about?

34:33.947 --> 34:36.365
I'm suggesting that you buy Sterling Cooper.

34:36.450 --> 34:37.908
There are very few client conflicts.

34:37.993 --> 34:40.745
All you haνe to do
is change the welcome mat.

34:40.829 --> 34:42.455
I didn't know it was for sale.

34:42.539 --> 34:46.041
Roger Sterling has a 20-year-old fiancée,

34:46.126 --> 34:49.628
and his wife's lawyer is not going
to leave him a pot to piss in.

34:54.593 --> 34:57.178
Alec, would you excuse us?

35:11.818 --> 35:14.487
Did he send you here with a price?

35:14.571 --> 35:16.989
Send me here?

35:17.115 --> 35:19.700
51% will cost you
a lot less than you think,

35:19.785 --> 35:20.785
plus a finder's fee.

35:20.869 --> 35:22.119
Two percent.

35:22.204 --> 35:24.413
I want to be in charge
of all international business,

35:24.498 --> 35:25.998
and I haνe to be president.

35:26.124 --> 35:28.751
Creative reports to me,
or the whole thing falls apart.

35:36.218 --> 35:38.636
Thank you for thinking of us.

35:40.972 --> 35:42.556
To old friends.

35:47.270 --> 35:48.854
Hello.

35:48.939 --> 35:51.524
Did you haνe any trouble finding me?

35:51.608 --> 35:52.858
Neighbors.

35:52.943 --> 35:54.068
Right.

35:55.737 --> 35:57.112
Would you like some wine?

35:57.197 --> 35:58.489
Very much.

36:16.174 --> 36:20.094
Listen, in the office,
I hope you weren't embarrassed.

36:20.178 --> 36:23.639
No. lt's okay. It's good.

36:25.767 --> 36:27.935
Well, if you have a man

36:28.019 --> 36:30.312
that you'd like to go
to the concert with tonight,

36:30.397 --> 36:31.856
I completely understand.

36:31.940 --> 36:35.901
Are you not on the trip tonight?

36:40.323 --> 36:43.450
I don't know why I pick the wrong boys.

36:44.870 --> 36:46.453
You're drinking sad.

36:49.082 --> 36:50.541
I don't know.

36:52.836 --> 36:55.337
What's wrong with me?

36:58.008 --> 36:59.300
You are old style.

37:02.137 --> 37:03.637
No, l'm not.

37:04.848 --> 37:08.225
This is not modern office,
a working woman.

37:09.603 --> 37:11.270
What are you talking about?

37:11.354 --> 37:13.063
I fix you.

37:16.359 --> 37:17.943
We should leave.

37:20.947 --> 37:22.489
Each time, Bob Dylan is late.

37:22.574 --> 37:24.325
He will not miss us a half hour.

37:24.409 --> 37:25.576
Sit.

37:27.120 --> 37:29.663
Look at me. I am very good.

37:31.958 --> 37:33.042
Just a trim.

37:33.126 --> 37:34.919
Yes.

37:50.602 --> 37:51.894
For you.

37:51.978 --> 37:52.937
Oh, my God.

37:53.021 --> 37:55.940
It's okay. It's good.

38:07.494 --> 38:10.788
We're headed to Lyford Cay, Nassau.

38:12.916 --> 38:14.166
Why?

38:15.794 --> 38:18.170
It's what we do.

38:18.296 --> 38:21.048
Something about taxes.

38:21.132 --> 38:22.967
It's very different than here.

38:26.346 --> 38:28.222
I think you'd like it.

38:39.693 --> 38:40.985
You'll need a tuxedo.

38:41.069 --> 38:43.320
Will I?

38:46.199 --> 38:47.741
You don't need a passport,

38:47.826 --> 38:50.452
unless you want to follow us to Capri after.

38:50.537 --> 38:53.414
Stephanie's uncle's an ambassador.

38:55.375 --> 38:56.709
Joy.

38:58.670 --> 39:00.796
My father will take care of you.

39:00.880 --> 39:02.756
He likes having you around.

39:02.841 --> 39:05.175
You're beautiful and you don't talk too much.

39:08.722 --> 39:10.723
I'm not possessive.

39:12.225 --> 39:14.226
You can be with anyone you want.

39:28.533 --> 39:30.325
Hello, Joy. Who is this?

39:30.410 --> 39:32.578
Christian, this is Don.

39:32.662 --> 39:34.413
Bernard and Amelia.

39:34.497 --> 39:37.916
Hello.

39:38.001 --> 39:39.418
Hello there.

39:40.962 --> 39:42.212
Did Isabel ring?

39:42.297 --> 39:43.922
Why would she?

39:44.007 --> 39:46.133
Because l'm sick of her attorneys.

39:46.217 --> 39:48.719
These are my children.
They should be with me.

39:50.722 --> 39:53.557
Are you in Edward's room?

39:54.934 --> 39:56.310
You can haνe it.

39:56.394 --> 39:57.478
Thank you.

39:57.562 --> 40:01.023
As you can see, we're very tired.

40:06.988 --> 40:08.447
Come, Bernard.

40:12.327 --> 40:13.786
You gave away our room?

40:16.664 --> 40:20.084
Looks like someone doesn't want to sleep.

40:58.957 --> 41:00.124
Come in.

41:01.918 --> 41:03.710
Joyce seems to have stepped away.

41:05.505 --> 41:07.798
I'm sorry, but Mr. Crane
accidentally opened this.

41:07.882 --> 41:09.633
Thank you, Joan.

41:11.886 --> 41:14.221
My, oh, my. A case.

41:14.305 --> 41:16.140
They're all there. I checked.

41:16.224 --> 41:18.183
All the card says is that it's for you.

41:19.477 --> 41:21.728
Well, thank you, Miss Holloway.

41:21.813 --> 41:23.272
Why don't you just take this?

41:23.356 --> 41:25.274
As a finder's fee.

41:25.358 --> 41:26.608
A whole bottle?

41:26.693 --> 41:27.901
It's the good stuff.

41:27.986 --> 41:29.987
I know. Thank you.

41:30.071 --> 41:31.155
Anything else?

41:31.239 --> 41:32.364
No, thank you.

41:45.378 --> 41:48.297
The town of Oxford is an armed camp,

41:48.381 --> 41:51.758
following riots that accompanied
the registration of the first Negro

41:51.843 --> 41:54.219
in the university's 1 1 8-year history.

41:54.304 --> 41:57.222
James H. Meredith was formally enrolled
in the Uniνersity of Mississippi--

41:57.307 --> 41:58.599
Hello, all.

41:58.683 --> 41:59.850
How the hell was California?

41:59.934 --> 42:01.977
Looks like Draper let you off the leash.

42:02.061 --> 42:03.228
Did you see this?

42:03.313 --> 42:06.315
Yes, I did. Strange, isn't it?

42:06.399 --> 42:08.108
Americans are free, in short,

42:08.193 --> 42:11.320
to disagree with the law,
but not to disobey it.

42:11.404 --> 42:12.613
For any government of laws...

42:12.697 --> 42:13.780
So, how was it?

42:13.865 --> 42:15.991
Spectacular, business-wise,

42:16.075 --> 42:18.785
but I don't know that I'd want to liνe there.

42:18.870 --> 42:20.662
Here. These are for eνerybody.

42:20.747 --> 42:22.206
I'd like to see it for myself.

42:22.290 --> 42:23.749
What's wrong with it?

42:23.833 --> 42:25.792
The people.

42:25.877 --> 42:27.628
I don't know.

42:27.712 --> 42:29.796
I'm glad to be home.

42:29.881 --> 42:31.757
Has Don checked in? Is he here?

42:31.841 --> 42:33.634
No. I don't think so.

42:33.718 --> 42:35.594
...by force, or threat of force,

42:35.678 --> 42:37.971
could long deny the commands...

42:38.056 --> 42:39.431
You look different.

42:39.557 --> 42:41.266
It's my hair.

42:41.351 --> 42:43.018
Right.

42:43.102 --> 42:44.603
Kurt's a homo.

42:44.687 --> 42:47.231
...no judge would be sure of his...

42:59.369 --> 43:04.748
So...are you leaving us?

43:04.832 --> 43:06.083
No.

43:06.167 --> 43:08.043
So? What, then?

43:08.127 --> 43:10.754
What if I told you that
the international divisions

43:10.838 --> 43:12.506
of General Foods, Bird's Eye,

43:12.590 --> 43:14.508
Campbell's Soup, Chevron Oil,

43:14.592 --> 43:16.051
Lever Brothers, Hoover,

43:16.135 --> 43:17.803
Warner Brothers, Eastern Airlines,

43:17.887 --> 43:21.640
and Chrysler can all be part
of Sterling Cooper?

43:21.724 --> 43:24.184
How is that possible?

43:24.269 --> 43:26.853
Saint John Powell,
of Putnam, Powell & Lowe,

43:26.938 --> 43:28.272
called me the other day.

43:28.356 --> 43:31.775
They want to open up a New York office
to deal with their American clients.

43:31.859 --> 43:35.612
They love the idea of just sticking
a key in the door at Sterling Cooper.

43:37.240 --> 43:39.783
Really?

43:39.867 --> 43:41.493
Is this as solid as American Airlines?

43:41.619 --> 43:44.329
I guess you're happy having to scramble

43:44.414 --> 43:46.206
on the third tier of this industry,

43:46.291 --> 43:49.459
waiting for minor divisions
of major companies to drop in your lap.

43:51.045 --> 43:53.630
On the table will be mountains of money,

43:53.715 --> 43:56.717
international prestige,
a chance at going public,

43:56.801 --> 43:58.302
and we don't haνe to change our name.

44:02.557 --> 44:03.974
I guess we could think about it.

44:04.058 --> 44:07.644
No. l need to know that you're open to this.

44:07.729 --> 44:10.981
If so, I'm giving them five business days
to try to impress us

44:11.065 --> 44:12.899
with a price for controlling
interest in the agency.

44:12.984 --> 44:14.484
There he is.

44:14.569 --> 44:17.070
There's the man I heard so much about.

44:18.448 --> 44:19.740
Five days to make an offer.

44:19.824 --> 44:22.451
Or you can give me a price,
and I'll pass it on.

44:22.535 --> 44:26.496
No. Let them open the kimono.

44:29.417 --> 44:32.419
Daddy, Daddy, over here!

44:32.503 --> 44:34.546
This water's cold.

44:37.342 --> 44:39.509
Stop splashing.

45:22.053 --> 45:23.929
Hello. lt's Dick Whitman.

45:27.725 --> 45:29.309
Yeah.

45:31.437 --> 45:34.106
I'd love to see you.

45:34.190 --> 45:35.315
Soon.

45:36.734 --> 45:39.194
No. l didn't bring it with me.

45:39.278 --> 45:40.445
Hold on.

45:54.085 --> 45:55.419
I'll see you soon.
