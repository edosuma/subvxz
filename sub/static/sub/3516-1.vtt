00:12.815 --> 00:14.732
Hey! What are you doing?

00:18.895 --> 00:20.938
- Jesus.
- Did you get a good look?

00:20.856 --> 00:22.898
Blue Toyota camry.
That's all I saw.

00:22.814 --> 00:24.065
That's the Whartons' dog.

00:24.016 --> 00:25.766
Aw, man.

00:25.696 --> 00:28.407
He's not going to make it.
Go see if they're home.

00:35.577 --> 00:39.831
Shh. Shh.

00:39.657 --> 00:41.991
It's okay.

00:44.218 --> 00:46.512
There are two kinds of pain...

00:46.419 --> 00:48.628
The sort of pain that makes you strong,

00:48.538 --> 00:50.498
or useless pain,

00:50.419 --> 00:53.545
the sort of pain that's only suffering.

00:53.419 --> 00:56.672
I have no patience for useless things.

00:58.139 --> 01:01.141
Moments like this require
someone who will act,

01:01.019 --> 01:04.188
who will do the unpleasant thing,

01:04.059 --> 01:06.561
the necessary thing.

01:10.859 --> 01:12.278
There.

01:12.222 --> 01:14.014
No more pain.

01:15.820 --> 01:18.698
It was a hit-and-run.
I'm awfully sorry.

01:18.581 --> 01:20.707
He must have jumped
over the fence again.

01:20.622 --> 01:22.623
Look, Steve is going to file
the report on the car,

01:22.542 --> 01:24.209
and he'll put his people on it.

01:24.141 --> 01:26.058
We'll track them down.

01:44.944 --> 01:47.905
You look stunning. Shall we?

01:47.785 --> 01:50.286
Three, two, one...

01:50.184 --> 01:52.686
Happy new year!

01:58.545 --> 02:01.089
Oh. President-elect
Garrett Walker.

02:00.987 --> 02:02.529
Do I like him? No.

02:02.466 --> 02:04.301
Do I believe in him?
That's beside the point.

02:04.227 --> 02:06.435
Any politician
that gets 70 million votes

02:06.347 --> 02:08.556
has tapped into something
larger than himself...

02:08.466 --> 02:10.717
Larger than even me,
as much as I hate to admit it.

02:10.627 --> 02:13.587
And look at that winning smile,
those trusting eyes.

02:13.467 --> 02:16.469
I latched onto him early on
and made myself vital.

02:16.348 --> 02:18.265
After 22 years in congress,

02:18.188 --> 02:20.649
I can smell which way
the wind is blowing.

02:20.549 --> 02:22.049
Oh, Jim Matthews,

02:21.989 --> 02:23.698
his right honorable
vice-president.

02:23.629 --> 02:25.380
Former governor of Pennsylvania.

02:25.310 --> 02:27.686
He did his duty in delivering
the keystone state,

02:27.589 --> 02:29.090
bless his heart,

02:29.030 --> 02:30.864
and now they're about
to put him out to pasture.

02:30.790 --> 02:32.832
But he looks happy enough, doesn't he?

02:32.749 --> 02:36.878
For some, it's simply
the size of the chair.

02:36.711 --> 02:38.461
Huh.

02:38.390 --> 02:40.725
Linda vasquez, Walker's chief of staff.

02:40.631 --> 02:42.048
I got her hired.

02:41.990 --> 02:44.241
She's a woman, check,
and a latina, check,

02:44.150 --> 02:45.693
but more important than that,

02:45.632 --> 02:47.673
she's as tough
as a two-dollar steak.

02:47.590 --> 02:49.133
Check, check, check.

02:49.072 --> 02:50.614
When it comes to the white house,

02:50.551 --> 02:52.803
you not only need the keys
in your back pocket,

02:52.712 --> 02:54.254
you need the gatekeeper.

02:54.192 --> 02:56.860
As for me, I'm just
a lowly house majority whip.

02:56.751 --> 02:58.585
I keep things moving in a congress

02:58.512 --> 03:00.722
choked by pettiness and lassitude.

03:00.633 --> 03:03.802
My job is to clear the pipes
and keep the sludge moving.

03:03.673 --> 03:05.632
But I won't have to be
a plumber much longer.

03:05.552 --> 03:08.012
I've done my time.
I backed the right man.

03:08.913 --> 03:10.831
Happy new year!

03:10.753 --> 03:12.546
Give and take.

03:12.474 --> 03:14.557
Welcome to Washington.

04:48.724 --> 04:50.726
You need a haircut.

04:50.644 --> 04:52.061
You think?

04:52.004 --> 04:53.963
A little trim.

04:55.084 --> 04:56.752
What are you going to wear?

04:56.685 --> 04:58.936
- You mean for the meeting?
- For the announcement.

04:58.846 --> 05:01.807
Gonna wear my Navy blue,
the one with the pinstripes.

05:01.686 --> 05:04.855
Good. You look handsome
in that suit.

05:05.924 --> 05:07.510
I don't know if they'll announce it

05:07.446 --> 05:08.987
before your board meeting.

05:08.925 --> 05:10.593
Well, as long as I can say
the donation is coming.

05:10.526 --> 05:12.068
As soon as it's official,

05:12.006 --> 05:14.341
Sancorp will write you a check.

05:16.966 --> 05:20.136
This is going to be a big year for us.

05:33.489 --> 05:35.616
You know, the meeting's on Tuesday.

05:37.768 --> 05:39.437
You're gonna wanna
start with something...

05:39.370 --> 05:40.954
That's what I'm hearing.

05:40.890 --> 05:42.431
Community of what?

05:42.369 --> 05:44.663
Or I could say immigration,
banking, or education,

05:44.570 --> 05:46.905
but none of my regular sources
can confirm that.

05:46.811 --> 05:48.603
Because they don't know,

05:48.530 --> 05:50.239
or because they're not talking?

05:50.170 --> 05:51.629
Because they don't know.

05:51.571 --> 05:53.822
Keep at it. Get me something.

05:53.731 --> 05:56.733
Sorry.
Sorry, Mr. Hammerschmidt.

05:56.611 --> 05:58.904
Zoe.

05:58.811 --> 06:01.146
- Barnes.
- Right.

06:03.891 --> 06:06.227
Did it take him a year
to remember your name?

06:06.132 --> 06:07.132
Longer.

06:07.093 --> 06:09.301
Good morning, Lucas.

06:09.211 --> 06:10.629
What can I do for you, Zoe?

06:13.091 --> 06:15.302
I am sick of the Fairfax county council.

06:15.213 --> 06:16.798
You tell me every day.

06:16.735 --> 06:18.527
Move me online. My own blog...

06:18.453 --> 06:20.954
First person, subjective, 500 words.

06:20.853 --> 06:23.063
- Not going to happen.
- I'll go underground.

06:22.974 --> 06:24.475
Back rooms. The urinals.

06:24.414 --> 06:26.248
I'll win over staff members on the hill.

06:26.175 --> 06:28.259
- They need a place to vent.
- A gossip column.

06:28.175 --> 06:30.718
No. We lift the veil,
what's really going on.

06:30.614 --> 06:32.490
This is the Washington herald, Zoe.

06:32.415 --> 06:34.208
It's not TMZ.

06:34.136 --> 06:35.469
Do you know how many people watch TMZ?

06:35.415 --> 06:36.791
I couldn't care less.

06:36.735 --> 06:38.527
Which is why print journalism is dying.

06:38.456 --> 06:40.624
Then it'll die with dignity,
at least at this paper.

06:40.536 --> 06:43.580
You are stuck in the 20th century, Lucas.
You lack imagination.

06:43.457 --> 06:44.749
Maybe so, but right now,

06:44.697 --> 06:46.656
I don't need imagination.
I need copy.

06:46.577 --> 06:48.453
Your nights and weekends are yours.

06:48.377 --> 06:49.919
I applaud whatever you want to do,

06:49.858 --> 06:51.566
as long as it's not on my time.

06:51.496 --> 06:53.664
- You're telling me to get back to work.
- I am.

06:53.577 --> 06:56.454
What you're really telling me
is to fuck off.

06:56.338 --> 06:57.964
I'm telling you both.

07:00.777 --> 07:05.365
It's Mr. Chapman already
from province trust.

07:10.099 --> 07:12.143
Hold my calls, Christina.

07:13.698 --> 07:17.202
Henry. It's good to see you.

07:17.060 --> 07:19.144
- How long are you in town for?
- Just today.

07:19.060 --> 07:21.270
Well, you gotta come back down
for the inauguration.

07:21.181 --> 07:23.223
I can hook you up.

07:23.140 --> 07:25.349
How about you hook me up with the zoning
laws you promised to get changed?

07:25.260 --> 07:27.261
We got 12 million sitting in escrow

07:27.180 --> 07:29.056
for an empty lot we can't build on.

07:28.980 --> 07:30.690
I know, but you gotta understand,

07:30.622 --> 07:31.871
it's a local municipal issue.

07:31.820 --> 07:33.821
I can't just pick up the phone...

07:33.741 --> 07:36.243
You can't? Because that's not
what you led us to believe

07:36.141 --> 07:38.268
when you begged
for 50 grand in donations.

07:38.182 --> 07:40.975
Right. I...

07:40.862 --> 07:42.071
One second.

07:42.024 --> 07:43.440
Christina, I said no calls,

07:43.382 --> 07:45.592
not while I'm meeting
with Mr. Chapman.

07:47.181 --> 07:49.476
The president-elect?

07:50.663 --> 07:52.289
I... do you mind?

07:52.223 --> 07:53.473
No. Go ahead, please.

07:53.423 --> 07:55.257
Uh, put him through, Christina.

07:55.183 --> 07:56.684
Ahem.

07:58.944 --> 08:00.862
Mr. president-elect?

08:03.583 --> 08:05.877
Thank you.
Uh, yes, we were, uh...

08:05.785 --> 08:08.411
We were pleased to win by double digits.

08:09.304 --> 08:11.057
Absolutely. Anything you need.

08:10.986 --> 08:14.279
I need you to put your
long, wet, talented tongue

08:14.145 --> 08:15.729
between my thighs

08:15.667 --> 08:18.294
and make me squeal like Monica Lewin...

08:19.346 --> 08:22.141
Me, too. Me, too.

08:22.905 --> 08:24.865
Okay. Thank you, sir.

08:25.905 --> 08:28.867
I'm so sorry.
Uh, where were we?

08:29.986 --> 08:32.238
Walker...

08:32.148 --> 08:33.774
What's he like?

08:46.308 --> 08:48.310
Mr. president-elect
running late?

08:48.229 --> 08:50.980
No, he couldn't make it.
I'll brief him, though.

08:52.029 --> 08:54.489
Okay. This is the memo
I've drafted

08:54.389 --> 08:56.516
on our middle east policy
we've been developing.

08:56.430 --> 08:58.347
Now, I want to borrow from Reagan.

08:58.271 --> 09:00.982
I'd like to coin the phrase
"trickle-down diplomacy."

09:00.871 --> 09:03.915
- That way...
- Frank, I'm going to stop you there.

09:03.792 --> 09:06.668
We are not nominating you
for secretary of state.

09:06.551 --> 09:08.427
I know he made you a promise,

09:08.352 --> 09:10.103
but circumstances have changed.

09:10.032 --> 09:11.658
The nature of promises, Linda,

09:11.592 --> 09:14.885
is that they remain immune
to changing circumstances.

09:14.752 --> 09:17.087
Garrett has thought long
and hard about this,

09:16.993 --> 09:19.870
and he's decided we need you
to stay in congress.

09:19.754 --> 09:22.464
When was this decision made,

09:22.354 --> 09:24.730
and why wasn't I part
of the conversation?

09:24.632 --> 09:26.216
I'm sorry, Frank.
If it had been up to me,

09:26.153 --> 09:27.737
I wouldn't have waited
this long to tell you.

09:27.673 --> 09:29.966
So, you knew you were going to do this.

09:29.874 --> 09:31.750
It has been an evolving discussion.

09:31.674 --> 09:34.760
It's a chicken-shit move.

09:34.635 --> 09:36.010
- Frank...
- I was vetted.

09:35.955 --> 09:37.372
- Was that a ruse?
- No.

09:37.315 --> 09:38.606
Let's be absolutely clear.

09:38.554 --> 09:40.555
You wouldn't have won without me.

09:40.474 --> 09:42.226
You're right, but now we have to lead,

09:42.155 --> 09:44.698
and that means making tough choices.

09:44.596 --> 09:47.472
As you know, education
is a top priority for us,

09:47.355 --> 09:49.065
a complete federal overhaul.

09:48.996 --> 09:51.414
But it's not just education.
Frank, congress is split.

09:51.316 --> 09:55.694
We need you there more than we
need you in the state department.

09:55.516 --> 09:57.726
I got you hired, Linda.

09:59.036 --> 10:00.204
I know.

10:00.157 --> 10:01.533
Donations, endorsements.

10:01.477 --> 10:03.061
I wrote the campaign's

10:02.998 --> 10:04.999
entire foreign policy platform.

10:04.918 --> 10:07.378
I bring years of
foreign affairs committee...

10:07.278 --> 10:09.612
Frank, please.

10:11.958 --> 10:14.293
I want to speak to Walker personally.

10:14.199 --> 10:16.408
The decision is made.

10:19.958 --> 10:22.586
We need you, Frank.

10:22.479 --> 10:24.855
Will you stand beside us or not?

10:33.800 --> 10:36.136
Of course. If that's
what the president wants.

10:36.042 --> 10:39.377
I'm very glad to hear that.

10:40.441 --> 10:42.610
I'm curious.

10:42.522 --> 10:44.356
If not me, then who?

10:46.081 --> 10:47.707
Michael kern.

10:47.641 --> 10:49.351
Michael kern?

10:50.601 --> 10:52.395
Well...

10:52.322 --> 10:54.865
That is an excellent choice.

10:58.282 --> 10:59.826
Can you make it more clear?

10:59.764 --> 11:01.556
I just want to make sure
it doesn't look like

11:01.483 --> 11:03.108
we're neglecting our domestic...

11:03.044 --> 11:04.462
No. No, no, no.
I'm going to say

11:04.404 --> 11:06.029
that we're expanding our mission.

11:05.964 --> 11:07.757
Okay.

11:07.684 --> 11:10.102
And we're bringing on
a new organization to help us.

11:10.005 --> 11:11.589
Do you know which one yet?

11:11.525 --> 11:13.776
I'm still looking into
a few options, but, um,

11:13.685 --> 11:15.144
tell me, what did we agree on,

11:15.085 --> 11:17.670
that we could hire
how many new people? Six?

11:17.565 --> 11:19.066
- Six, maybe seven.
- Hmm?

11:19.006 --> 11:20.840
We'll have enough.

11:20.766 --> 11:22.474
Ooh, it's exciting, huh?

11:22.406 --> 11:25.534
This, uh, new direction we're heading.

11:25.406 --> 11:28.324
I just don't know where we're
going to fit all the people.

11:28.206 --> 11:30.249
Well, do you think we have
to look into additional space?

11:30.167 --> 11:31.917
No. No, no, no.
I'll find a way.

11:31.846 --> 11:33.514
Okay, so make the changes
to the PowerPoint,

11:33.447 --> 11:35.156
and let's meet again at 2:30.

11:35.087 --> 11:36.421
Okay.

11:43.769 --> 11:45.937
Leave a message
for Frank Underwood.

11:47.049 --> 11:48.549
It's me.

11:48.489 --> 11:50.532
I feel like an idiot
leaving messages like this.

11:50.448 --> 11:52.073
Call me back.

12:03.410 --> 12:04.535
What is it, Zoe?

12:04.490 --> 12:06.491
Um...

12:06.409 --> 12:08.536
I know you're going to have your
hands full at the white house,

12:08.451 --> 12:11.661
so if you need someone
to do research or...

12:11.531 --> 12:12.865
Or print out background...

12:12.811 --> 12:14.478
I think I'll be fine.

12:14.411 --> 12:16.997
Well, if things get hectic
and you need any help...

12:16.892 --> 12:21.103
So you can blog about rubbing
shoulders with the big boys?

12:23.771 --> 12:25.231
What did Lucas tell you?

12:25.173 --> 12:27.132
Look, no offense, Zoe,
but I don't have time

12:27.052 --> 12:29.304
to be anyone's training wheels.

12:29.214 --> 12:31.590
I just thought...

12:31.493 --> 12:34.120
No, I was actually offering
to lend a hand.

12:34.014 --> 12:35.764
- That's it.
- Got it.

12:35.694 --> 12:37.403
Thanks.

13:15.696 --> 13:17.573
- Claire.
- You didn't call.

13:17.498 --> 13:20.876
- I was...
- You didn't call me, Francis.

13:20.740 --> 13:23.200
Nine hours.
You don't not call me,

13:23.099 --> 13:24.766
not when it's this big.

13:24.699 --> 13:26.033
You're right.

13:25.979 --> 13:29.023
When have we ever avoided each other?

13:30.779 --> 13:32.781
I wanted the solution first.

13:32.701 --> 13:34.118
Do you have one?

13:34.060 --> 13:35.935
Not yet.

13:35.860 --> 13:37.903
This affects me, too, Francis.

13:37.819 --> 13:40.779
And it's not the money I'm upset about.

13:40.660 --> 13:43.329
It's that we do things together.

13:43.221 --> 13:45.889
When you don't involve me,
we're in free-fall.

13:45.781 --> 13:48.533
I should've called you, and I didn't.

13:48.421 --> 13:49.838
What happened?

13:51.141 --> 13:53.519
She says they needed
to keep me in congress.

13:53.422 --> 13:54.630
Linda said that?

13:54.581 --> 13:55.790
Walker wasn't even there.

13:55.743 --> 13:57.327
That's what really gets me.

13:57.263 --> 13:59.097
He didn't have the courage
to look me in the eye.

13:59.024 --> 14:00.774
I knew you shouldn't trust that woman.

14:00.702 --> 14:02.454
I didn't. I don't.
I don't trust anyone.

14:02.383 --> 14:04.550
Then how could you not see this coming?

14:05.943 --> 14:08.070
I never thought they were capable.

14:07.984 --> 14:10.860
You don't usually
underestimate people, Francis.

14:10.743 --> 14:12.036
I know.

14:13.424 --> 14:16.010
Hubris. Ambition.

14:15.904 --> 14:17.112
You should be angry.

14:17.065 --> 14:18.357
I'm livid.

14:18.304 --> 14:20.222
Then where is that?
I don't see it.

14:20.145 --> 14:22.438
What do you want me to do? Scream and yell?
Throw a tantrum?

14:22.345 --> 14:24.888
I want more than I'm seeing
. You're better than this, Francis.

14:24.785 --> 14:27.954
Well, I'm sorry, Claire.
I am sorry.

14:27.826 --> 14:29.618
No, that I won't accept.

14:29.546 --> 14:32.298
- What?
- Apologies.

14:34.345 --> 14:36.806
My husband doesn't apologize,

14:36.707 --> 14:38.833
even to me.

16:20.157 --> 16:21.784
How long you been up?

16:21.719 --> 16:23.428
Hours.

16:25.716 --> 16:27.927
I know what I have to do.

16:27.839 --> 16:29.465
Good.

16:29.399 --> 16:32.150
We'll have a lot of nights like this...

16:32.039 --> 16:35.792
Making plans, very little sleep.

16:35.639 --> 16:37.932
I expected that.

16:37.839 --> 16:40.382
It doesn't worry me.

16:48.879 --> 16:51.215
I'd better get to work.

16:51.121 --> 16:54.665
I laid a suit out for you upstairs.

16:54.522 --> 16:56.857
The Navy-blue one.

17:02.202 --> 17:03.704
I love that woman.

17:03.643 --> 17:05.853
I love her more than sharks love blood.

17:08.962 --> 17:10.838
President-elect
Garrett Walker has just...

17:10.762 --> 17:12.638
Why do you think
they went with him?

17:12.564 --> 17:15.273
We're too good. They can't
afford to lose us in congress.

17:15.164 --> 17:17.040
He's had work done.

17:16.964 --> 17:18.631
Chin tuck probably.

17:18.564 --> 17:19.731
Definitely dyes his hair.

17:21.404 --> 17:22.529
Do we say anything?

17:22.484 --> 17:23.903
No. God, no.

17:23.845 --> 17:25.637
Not unless he brings it up.

17:25.565 --> 17:27.190
Nancy!

17:27.124 --> 17:28.625
- 9:20...
- Cancel everything.

17:28.565 --> 17:30.775
Stamper, you're with me.

17:30.686 --> 17:32.311
Now, look...

17:33.605 --> 17:36.148
They've done us
a great favor, Doug.

17:36.045 --> 17:38.631
We are no longer bound by allegiances.

17:38.527 --> 17:40.236
We serve no one.

17:40.168 --> 17:42.419
We live by one rule and one rule only...

17:42.326 --> 17:44.327
Never again will we allow ourselves

17:44.247 --> 17:46.498
to be put in such a position.

17:46.408 --> 17:47.783
Walker and vasquez.

17:47.727 --> 17:50.855
All of them.
I hold them all accountable.

17:50.728 --> 17:53.187
- Want retribution?
- No. No.

17:53.088 --> 17:55.673
It's more than that.

17:55.568 --> 17:57.986
Take a step back.

17:57.888 --> 17:59.598
Look at the bigger picture.

17:59.529 --> 18:02.322
I think I see what you're getting at.

18:02.209 --> 18:03.543
Kern first?

18:03.488 --> 18:05.613
That's how you devour a whale, Doug...

18:05.528 --> 18:07.238
One bite at a time.

18:07.169 --> 18:09.419
Who would you want
for secretary of state?

18:09.329 --> 18:10.956
Give me a list of choices.

18:10.890 --> 18:14.100
And however we do this,
we'll also need a buffer.

18:13.969 --> 18:15.386
You mean an errand boy.

18:15.330 --> 18:17.790
Yes, someone we control completely.

18:18.889 --> 18:20.641
I'll keep my ear to the ground.

18:20.571 --> 18:22.029
Good.

18:21.970 --> 18:24.889
I haven't eaten since yesterday.

18:42.252 --> 18:44.087
I almost pity him.

18:44.013 --> 18:46.055
He didn't choose
to be put on my platter.

18:45.973 --> 18:48.308
When I carve him up
and toss him to the dogs,

18:48.213 --> 18:52.258
only then will he confront that
brutal, inescapable truth...

18:52.093 --> 18:54.011
"My God.

18:53.934 --> 18:57.519
All I ever amounted to
was chitlins."

18:57.374 --> 19:00.252
And he that shall humble himself

19:00.136 --> 19:03.054
shall be exalted.

19:04.254 --> 19:08.216
Matthew, chapter 23, verse 12.

19:08.055 --> 19:11.433
Thanks be to God.

19:11.296 --> 19:13.130
I'd like to speak today

19:13.056 --> 19:16.976
on the subject of humility.

19:16.817 --> 19:19.902
A lot of you have
just won re-election.

19:19.776 --> 19:22.569
If you hadn't,
you might not be sitting here.

19:23.858 --> 19:26.484
And, of course,
we should enjoy our success

19:26.378 --> 19:28.087
and be grateful for it,

19:28.017 --> 19:32.980
but never let your gratitude
sour into pride.

19:32.779 --> 19:35.196
You'll have many challenges ahead

19:35.098 --> 19:36.891
over the next couple of years,

19:36.819 --> 19:39.904
and a person's character
isn't determined

19:39.778 --> 19:42.571
by how he or she enjoys victory

19:42.458 --> 19:47.588
but rather how he or she endures defeat.

19:47.380 --> 19:51.466
Nothing can help us endure dark times

19:51.300 --> 19:54.469
better than our faith.

19:54.340 --> 19:55.716
Claire.

19:55.661 --> 19:56.952
Oh, hello, felicity.

19:56.900 --> 19:58.735
- How are you?
- Good. How are you?

19:58.661 --> 20:01.246
Good. I'm sorry.
It's just not right.

20:01.141 --> 20:02.849
Oh.

20:02.780 --> 20:04.740
Charles and I can't understand
what Walker was thinking.

20:04.661 --> 20:07.621
Oh, that's very sweet of you,
but really between you and me,

20:07.502 --> 20:09.879
I think Francis is relieved.

20:09.783 --> 20:13.244
He just feels much more
at home in congress.

20:13.103 --> 20:15.270
I would've bet a million dollars
they were gonna pick you.

20:15.183 --> 20:18.519
Well, it's a good thing you have
a million dollars to spare.

20:18.383 --> 20:20.885
But you are, by far and away,
the only choice.

20:20.783 --> 20:22.575
I appreciate you saying that.

20:22.503 --> 20:25.505
I mean, Michael? Come on. He's
got half the experience...

20:25.384 --> 20:28.136
Garrett is a smart man.
He knows what he's doing.

20:28.025 --> 20:31.152
You're a bigger man than I, Frank.

21:00.147 --> 21:03.817
You, uh... you want
some of that wine?

21:04.588 --> 21:07.048
Yes, definitely.

21:12.348 --> 21:14.766
Man, this is some good shit.
Where'd you get it?

21:14.669 --> 21:18.881
Uh, I kind of lifted it
from the V.I.P. room

21:18.709 --> 21:20.668
of the speaker's holiday party.

21:20.590 --> 21:24.218
I'm impressed.
Bordeaux, 20 years old.

21:24.070 --> 21:26.404
Oh, it seemed about right for you.

21:26.310 --> 21:28.771
Ouch. Why would you
say that to me?

21:28.672 --> 21:31.173
I'm almost 30. That's practically
ancient in your book.

21:31.071 --> 21:33.239
I don't discriminate
when it comes to age.

21:33.151 --> 21:35.110
Really? When was the last time
you hired a 40-year-old staffer?

21:35.031 --> 21:36.907
Doesn't mean I wouldn't.

21:36.832 --> 21:38.333
Well, as long as she's good in the sack.

21:38.273 --> 21:41.108
- Come on.
- Well, it's true, isn't it?

21:40.993 --> 21:43.286
Where is this coming from?

21:44.791 --> 21:47.210
You're not going to just toss me aside

21:47.113 --> 21:49.364
for some slut straight out of vassar.

21:49.272 --> 21:51.565
So, we're having that conversation.

21:51.473 --> 21:53.056
It's been six months.

21:52.992 --> 21:54.577
It's not a little office fling anymore.

21:54.513 --> 21:57.682
You want me to say
those three magic words,

21:57.554 --> 21:59.513
one of which starts
with an "L."

21:59.434 --> 22:01.477
- Mm-mm. No.
- Okay.

22:01.394 --> 22:03.103
I'll say 'em.

22:03.034 --> 22:05.618
Christina Gallagher...

22:06.395 --> 22:08.355
Lick my balls.

22:08.275 --> 22:10.484
Oh, my... you bastard.

22:10.395 --> 22:12.939
- Hey.
- I love you.

22:12.836 --> 22:15.671
I love you, Christina.

22:15.556 --> 22:17.640
I love you.

22:24.356 --> 22:26.191
Now will you lick my balls?

22:37.957 --> 22:39.374
So, I'm curious.

22:39.319 --> 22:42.363
Are we patrons, benefactors, or lepers?

22:42.238 --> 22:45.657
Believe it or not, we're angels.

22:50.559 --> 22:53.144
I'm going to go outside and
pretend to use my cell phone.

22:53.039 --> 22:54.373
Go.

23:03.842 --> 23:05.217
Can I have your jacket?

23:05.161 --> 23:07.370
Yeah. Here you go.

23:46.365 --> 23:47.825
Are you going to bed?

23:47.765 --> 23:49.641
I'll be up in a bit.

23:49.566 --> 23:50.942
Don't stay up all night.

23:50.886 --> 23:52.386
No, I'll be right there.

24:01.205 --> 24:03.249
Thanks so much. I'll call you.

24:04.526 --> 24:07.779
Wait. I thought you
had a good time.

24:07.647 --> 24:09.857
Oh, I did. I loved it.

24:09.768 --> 24:11.060
I've never been before.

24:11.008 --> 24:13.927
Well, maybe I could come up.

24:13.810 --> 24:17.186
Oh, Ryan, you're so sweet.

24:17.048 --> 24:18.716
Really.

24:18.648 --> 24:22.109
But if I was gonna fuck you, you'd know.

24:21.969 --> 24:24.220
Thanks so much.

25:51.338 --> 25:53.214
- She's here.
- Send her in.

25:53.138 --> 25:55.306
It's quite rare for
a president's chief of staff

25:55.220 --> 25:56.512
to climb the hill,

25:56.458 --> 25:57.874
a gesture of respect, no doubt,

25:57.818 --> 25:59.612
or desperation.

25:59.539 --> 26:03.291
I'm guessing she'll say,
"Donald blythe for education."

26:04.460 --> 26:06.795
Let's see if I'm right.

26:07.699 --> 26:09.868
Good morning, Linda.

26:09.782 --> 26:11.866
Thank you so much
for making the trip up.

26:11.780 --> 26:13.198
Of course. My pleasure.

26:13.141 --> 26:16.183
- Education.
- First things first.

26:16.061 --> 26:18.271
The seating chart for the inauguration.

26:18.180 --> 26:20.098
How do these two work
for you and Claire?

26:20.021 --> 26:21.731
Wow.

26:21.663 --> 26:22.870
They come with a complimentary
set of tickets

26:22.821 --> 26:24.239
to the Jefferson ball.

26:24.182 --> 26:25.974
Claire will be over the moon.

26:25.902 --> 26:27.987
Good. I'm so glad.

26:27.903 --> 26:30.612
So... education.

26:30.502 --> 26:32.963
We have Donald blythe
drafting the legislation.

26:32.864 --> 26:35.907
- Donald blythe. Jesus.
- I know.

26:35.783 --> 26:39.745
So, you want a bill just
two steps left of Karl Marx.

26:39.583 --> 26:43.335
I advised the president-elect against it,
but Donald is the face of education.

26:43.184 --> 26:45.436
He's been pushing reform for 25 years.

26:45.344 --> 26:47.345
You want me to guide him to the middle.

26:47.265 --> 26:49.891
We need a bill we can pass.

26:49.785 --> 26:52.829
Do I have absolute autonomy
and authority on this?

26:52.706 --> 26:54.581
There's more.

26:54.504 --> 26:56.256
Garrett wants the bill on the floor

26:56.186 --> 26:57.936
in the first 100 days.

26:57.865 --> 27:01.618
He wants to make a pledge
in his inaugural address.

27:01.466 --> 27:03.134
Well, that's...

27:04.467 --> 27:06.385
That's very ambitious, Linda.

27:06.307 --> 27:08.224
Can we make that pledge?

27:10.666 --> 27:12.167
100 days?

27:13.467 --> 27:15.552
I can deliver.

27:19.627 --> 27:21.462
- Keep me posted.
- I'll talk with Donald.

27:21.388 --> 27:23.223
I'll check in with you
later in the week.

27:23.149 --> 27:24.566
Terrific.

27:24.509 --> 27:25.843
Did you smell that?

27:25.789 --> 27:28.124
The smugness, the false deference.

27:28.029 --> 27:30.405
She thinks I can be bought
with a pair of tickets.

27:30.309 --> 27:32.769
What am I, a whore
in post-war Berlin,

27:32.670 --> 27:35.463
salivating over free stockings
and chocolate?

27:35.350 --> 27:38.936
What she's asking will cost
far more than that.

27:39.869 --> 27:42.580
Ferguson. Too old.

27:42.470 --> 27:45.680
- Willis.
- Too stupid.

27:45.550 --> 27:48.928
- Boyd.
- Too queer.

27:48.791 --> 27:50.876
Really?

27:50.791 --> 27:52.833
He's married with three kids.

27:52.751 --> 27:54.293
And wouldn't they be devastated?

27:54.232 --> 27:58.319
All right.
What about Catherine durant?

27:58.152 --> 27:59.986
Cathy durant?

27:59.912 --> 28:01.996
She was vocally anti-Walker.

28:01.912 --> 28:03.663
She's got the experience.

28:04.512 --> 28:06.596
Set up a meeting.

28:10.072 --> 28:11.782
Hey.

28:13.313 --> 28:16.316
- The donation from Sancorp.
- Hmm?

28:16.193 --> 28:18.069
The money will have to come
from somewhere else.

28:17.995 --> 28:20.497
God, what... what happened?

28:20.395 --> 28:22.354
I've looked over the budget
for fiscal '13,

28:22.274 --> 28:25.693
and we've allocated
1.6 million for salaries.

28:25.555 --> 28:27.515
We need to cut that in half.

28:27.435 --> 28:28.976
Well, you're suggesting...

28:28.914 --> 28:31.416
Evelyn, we're going to let
some people go.

28:31.315 --> 28:33.316
That would be half of our staff.

28:33.237 --> 28:34.737
We have to carve out some room.

28:34.676 --> 28:37.929
But you would have to fire
some essential people

28:37.797 --> 28:39.840
who've been with us since the beginning.

28:39.757 --> 28:41.215
We are a charity,

28:41.156 --> 28:43.366
but not for our employees.

28:43.277 --> 28:45.653
You know, um, Claire,
I have held my tongue

28:45.558 --> 28:48.101
about this whole international
thing for a while,

28:47.997 --> 28:49.582
but I don't get it.

28:49.518 --> 28:51.268
I mean, we are really good
at what we do.

28:51.198 --> 28:53.950
Why do we have to try and be
something we're not?

28:53.838 --> 28:55.546
Because we've plateaued, Evelyn,

28:55.478 --> 28:58.106
and it is time for us,
for our entire organization...

28:57.999 --> 28:59.291
What, digging Wells in Africa?

28:59.239 --> 29:01.740
We don't know anything about that.

29:01.639 --> 29:04.557
Which is why we have
to bring in new people.

29:04.439 --> 29:07.149
This is the plan
that I've proposed to the board,

29:07.038 --> 29:10.165
and we are moving forward with it.

29:10.040 --> 29:13.918
I'd like a list of names, please.

29:13.760 --> 29:16.346
Claire, could we just think about this?

29:16.240 --> 29:17.865
I have thought about it.

29:17.800 --> 29:19.801
I've put a lot of thought into it.

29:19.721 --> 29:21.471
- Yeah, but I think that we can really...
- Evelyn.

29:21.400 --> 29:23.235
You're the office manager.

29:23.161 --> 29:26.038
I need you to trust
that I know what I'm doing,

29:25.922 --> 29:29.215
so please get me that list
as soon as possible.

29:38.122 --> 29:40.791
- Oh, ma'am, you can't go up there.
- I'm sorry. I just...

29:40.683 --> 29:41.808
- I just have one question.
- No, no. You gotta come...

29:41.763 --> 29:43.555
Sir, I apologize. This woman...

29:43.483 --> 29:45.360
- Congressman.
- Miss, you need to step away from the fellow.

29:45.283 --> 29:47.951
- If I could just have one second.
- Step away from the...

29:47.844 --> 29:49.011
Who are you?

29:48.964 --> 29:50.589
My name is Zoe Barnes.

29:50.524 --> 29:54.569
I'm a reporter at the Washington herald.

29:54.404 --> 29:57.740
It is after 10:30 at night,
and this is my home.

29:57.604 --> 29:59.021
I do not allow any...

29:58.964 --> 30:01.966
We're part of
a mutual admiration society.

30:04.805 --> 30:06.516
You're a fan of the symphony.

30:06.446 --> 30:09.781
Well, more for the people
watching than the music.

30:11.726 --> 30:14.520
It's all right, Steve.
Come on in, miss Barnes.

30:29.487 --> 30:30.946
It's strong.

30:30.889 --> 30:32.432
Do you prefer it weak?

30:32.370 --> 30:34.829
No. The stronger, the better.

30:37.567 --> 30:39.319
There's no harm in looking.

30:39.249 --> 30:41.459
It's a cheap ploy.

30:41.370 --> 30:44.789
It's cheap but effective.

30:44.651 --> 30:47.528
Well, you certainly have
my undivided attention.

30:47.411 --> 30:49.954
Good. The reason I'm here...

30:49.850 --> 30:52.685
Oh, is foreplay over?

30:52.571 --> 30:56.157
I read somewhere that jfk never
lasted more than three minutes.

30:56.011 --> 30:57.220
The point being?

30:57.172 --> 30:58.714
Time is precious.

30:58.651 --> 31:01.111
Powerful people don't have
the luxury of foreplay.

31:01.011 --> 31:04.262
Okay, so why are you here, miss Barnes?

31:04.131 --> 31:06.550
I need somebody I can talk to.

31:06.452 --> 31:09.746
We're talking. Tell me
what we're talking about.

31:11.171 --> 31:13.591
I protect your identity,
I print whatever you tell me,

31:13.493 --> 31:15.160
and I'll never ask any questions.

31:15.094 --> 31:17.011
And what makes you think
I don't already have

31:16.932 --> 31:18.850
such an arrangement with
one of your colleagues?

31:18.774 --> 31:22.610
Because if you did, you wouldn't
have let me through the door.

31:22.454 --> 31:25.165
I've led a very long,
very successful career

31:25.055 --> 31:27.430
avoiding this sort of intrigue
with the press.

31:27.334 --> 31:29.628
I can't see any advantage
in starting now.

31:29.535 --> 31:31.160
But is there any disadvantage?

31:31.095 --> 31:32.596
Sloppiness, for one.

31:32.535 --> 31:34.828
I promise you absolute discretion.

31:34.736 --> 31:37.529
So, we're talking about trust.

31:37.415 --> 31:39.208
Use whatever word you like.

31:39.136 --> 31:40.970
Words matter very much, miss Barnes.

31:40.896 --> 31:43.272
You should care more about
them, given your profession.

31:43.176 --> 31:45.177
Then, yes...

31:45.096 --> 31:47.056
Your trust.

31:46.977 --> 31:49.770
So, which Zoe Barnes am I to trust?

31:49.657 --> 31:52.909
The one who wrote about the fireman
that married the meter maid,

31:52.777 --> 31:55.320
or the one who authored
a very fine article

31:55.217 --> 31:58.177
on a new jogging path
in rock creek park?

31:58.057 --> 32:00.100
Don't be flattered.
I read everything.

32:00.017 --> 32:03.729
I'm better than what they have me doing.

32:04.817 --> 32:07.653
- You know what that feels like.
- Do I?

32:07.539 --> 32:09.999
You'd have made
a great secretary of state.

32:13.898 --> 32:16.860
How exactly may I help you, miss Barnes?

32:18.379 --> 32:20.715
You must know the administration's
legislative agenda,

32:20.620 --> 32:23.497
- what's coming up first.
- I may.

32:23.380 --> 32:25.172
Will you tell me?

32:25.100 --> 32:27.768
What would be your guess?

32:29.180 --> 32:31.182
- Education.
- Why?

32:31.102 --> 32:33.561
Im-immigration
is too controversial.

32:33.461 --> 32:36.505
Tax reform isn't sexy enough.

32:36.381 --> 32:40.134
Everyone can get behind children.

32:39.982 --> 32:42.901
- Is it education?
- You might very well think that.

32:42.783 --> 32:44.951
I couldn't possibly comment.

32:44.863 --> 32:47.489
- A hint.
- It's late, miss Barnes.

32:47.383 --> 32:50.135
- Can we talk again?
- I hope you'll understand

32:50.024 --> 32:51.732
that I wanna sleep on all this.

32:51.662 --> 32:53.163
I never make such big decisions

32:53.103 --> 32:57.106
so long after sunset
and so far from dawn.

33:01.464 --> 33:03.508
My cell phone's on the back.

33:03.424 --> 33:05.341
Did you put miss Barnes
in the visitors' ledger?

33:05.264 --> 33:06.640
Not yet.

33:06.585 --> 33:09.420
- Don't. Needless to say.
- Needless.

33:09.305 --> 33:10.347
Hello.

33:10.306 --> 33:12.265
Claire!

33:12.185 --> 33:14.770
This is miss Zoe Barnes
of the Washington herald.

33:14.666 --> 33:16.208
She was just leaving.

33:16.145 --> 33:18.522
Very nice to meet you,
Mrs. Underwood.

33:19.306 --> 33:20.598
Drive safe.

33:20.546 --> 33:22.756
There's a lot of ice on the road.

33:24.026 --> 33:25.986
I will.

33:25.907 --> 33:28.075
Thank you.

33:28.947 --> 33:30.782
Does that work on anybody?

33:30.708 --> 33:32.250
Does what?

33:32.188 --> 33:34.648
The pushup bra
and the v-neck tee.

33:34.547 --> 33:38.216
Well, if it does,
I don't know who they are.

33:44.068 --> 33:46.779
Okay, relax, relax.

33:54.470 --> 33:56.305
License and registration.

33:56.230 --> 33:59.232
Uh, the glove compartment, sweetheart.

34:00.869 --> 34:03.955
This isn't your driver's license.
It's a Starbucks card.

34:03.830 --> 34:05.998
Oh, shit. Sorry.

34:05.912 --> 34:07.705
Sir, have you been drinking?

34:07.632 --> 34:09.800
No, I never drink coffee at this hour.

34:09.712 --> 34:12.005
I'm going to need you
to step out of the car.

34:11.911 --> 34:14.371
Hey, if I was speeding,
you can write me a ticket...

34:14.271 --> 34:17.398
Sir, step out of the car right now.

34:20.071 --> 34:21.907
Look, I don't want to be a prick,

34:21.833 --> 34:23.835
but I'm a member of...
Of congress.

34:23.754 --> 34:26.213
I don't care if you're
the king of China.

34:26.112 --> 34:28.280
China doesn't h-ave a king.

34:28.194 --> 34:31.447
It's a communist "agua-larchy."

34:31.315 --> 34:34.275
- Oligar... "Oliguarchy."
- Let's go. Out.

34:34.155 --> 34:37.282
- You, too, sweetie.
- Fuck. That's hard to say.

34:51.036 --> 34:53.538
Ahem. Hello.

34:55.636 --> 34:57.346
Good.

34:58.676 --> 35:01.012
Well, let's get him out.

35:08.398 --> 35:13.068
♪ Gonna fly high like a bird
up in the sky right now ♪

35:14.398 --> 35:18.361
♪ I've got a story, ain't got no moral ♪

35:19.558 --> 35:22.937
♪ let the bad guy win

35:24.239 --> 35:28.743
♪ I've got a story,

35:28.560 --> 35:30.811
Mind if I join you?

35:30.720 --> 35:32.888
What the fuck is going on?

35:32.801 --> 35:34.552
I thought I was meeting
with the congress...

35:34.482 --> 35:35.857
No, you're meeting me.

35:35.801 --> 35:38.261
It's 4:00
in the goddamn morning.

35:38.162 --> 35:39.912
I got a city council meeting...

35:39.841 --> 35:41.926
You've been police commissioner
for what,

35:41.842 --> 35:43.801
almost a decade now?

35:43.722 --> 35:46.015
We're here to talk about my resume?

35:45.922 --> 35:49.383
"Mayor of D.C." would look good
on that resume, wouldn't it?

35:49.242 --> 35:52.661
We know that you've been
angling to run for some time.

35:52.523 --> 35:54.524
Experience is your strong suit.

35:54.443 --> 35:57.779
Endorsement and fundraising,
they're not.

35:57.643 --> 36:00.478
We can help with that.

36:02.644 --> 36:04.395
Russo.

36:10.644 --> 36:14.231
Russo. You're free to go.

36:15.324 --> 36:16.867
It was just a few drinks.

36:16.806 --> 36:18.223
It was enough
to get pulled over.

36:18.165 --> 36:20.041
But I wasn't drunk drunk.

36:22.966 --> 36:25.384
- Were you alone?
- Yes.

36:25.286 --> 36:26.828
Say that to my face.

36:26.766 --> 36:28.934
- Hey, watch the road.
- Say it to my face.

36:28.846 --> 36:31.390
Yes... I was alone.

36:34.446 --> 36:37.325
You cannot keep doing this, Peter.

36:37.207 --> 36:39.416
It's going to catch up with you.

36:40.607 --> 36:42.275
I know.

36:44.127 --> 36:46.463
Do you think we can arrange
two more at our table

36:46.368 --> 36:47.702
for the Jefferson ball?

36:47.650 --> 36:50.151
- For whom?
- The Holburnes.

36:50.049 --> 36:52.091
Why on earth would you want them there?

36:52.009 --> 36:53.718
I'm going to need her money
for the C.W.I.

36:53.649 --> 36:55.442
The staff cuts are just not enough.

36:55.369 --> 36:56.995
I'll talk to vasquez.

36:56.931 --> 36:59.640
- How are we doing?
- Good. Progress.

36:59.530 --> 37:01.198
Irons in the fire.

37:01.129 --> 37:02.588
I like irons,

37:02.531 --> 37:05.116
but I love fire.

37:19.211 --> 37:21.339
Yes...

37:23.252 --> 37:24.670
Ah.

37:27.212 --> 37:28.588
What are you...

37:28.532 --> 37:30.241
The bill is garbage, Donald.

37:30.173 --> 37:32.550
Tax increases, ban on
vouchers, federal oversight...

37:32.454 --> 37:34.496
How do you expect me to get
that through a committee?

37:34.413 --> 37:36.206
When Linda told me
to write it, she promised...

37:36.134 --> 37:37.760
I'm sure she said any number of things.

37:37.694 --> 37:39.319
Forget what they promised you, Donald.

37:39.254 --> 37:42.256
They want your name
because it carries weight.

37:42.134 --> 37:43.843
Well, my name comes with my ideas.

37:43.774 --> 37:45.566
I understand, but you've
got to be reasonable.

37:45.494 --> 37:46.870
This isn't the great debate.

37:46.815 --> 37:49.192
It's about passing meaningful reform.

37:49.096 --> 37:53.473
Maybe not everything you would've
hoped, but help me help you.

37:53.295 --> 37:55.129
That's going to take time.

37:55.054 --> 37:56.889
I... those ideas, I've
been developing them for...

37:56.816 --> 37:59.150
If it's time you need,
I will buy you time,

37:59.055 --> 38:01.015
but you've got to promise me
your next-at-bat

38:00.937 --> 38:04.189
is going to give me something
I can work with.

38:04.057 --> 38:06.642
Okay, Frank, I'll see what I can do.

38:06.537 --> 38:08.830
Good. And, Donald, don't let
this get you down, all right?

38:08.737 --> 38:14.575
Together we're going to do more than
you've been able to do in 25 years.

38:16.938 --> 38:18.773
Two things are now irrelevant...

38:18.699 --> 38:21.241
Donald blythe
and Donald Blythe's new draft.

38:21.137 --> 38:23.347
Eventually I'll have
to rewrite the bill myself.

38:23.258 --> 38:25.176
Forward!
That is the battle cry.

38:25.099 --> 38:27.392
Leave ideology to the armchair generals.

38:27.299 --> 38:29.175
It does me no good.

38:29.100 --> 38:31.726
Walker just nominated kern.

38:31.619 --> 38:34.330
It's a long road to confirmation.

38:34.221 --> 38:37.014
- Kern is a boy scout.
- Nobody's a boy scout.

38:36.901 --> 38:38.610
Not even boy scouts.

38:39.418 --> 38:40.753
What do you have?

38:40.701 --> 38:42.535
Absolutely nothing.

38:43.942 --> 38:45.609
Then what are we talking about?

38:45.541 --> 38:47.083
Just asking a simple question.

38:47.022 --> 38:48.815
Does the job interest you?

38:50.221 --> 38:52.848
Why would you want Michael gone?

38:52.743 --> 38:54.786
Cathy, you and I came up together.

38:54.701 --> 38:56.869
The foreign affairs committee needs
a secretary we can work with,

38:56.783 --> 39:00.286
someone who isn't afraid to stand
up to Walker when he's wrong.

39:00.143 --> 39:02.393
We need you.

39:06.302 --> 39:08.388
Let's assume I am interested.

39:08.303 --> 39:10.053
I don't want to assume.

39:09.982 --> 39:12.651
I want to know.

39:53.147 --> 39:54.900
2...Okay.

39:54.829 --> 39:56.204
2-6-3-7.

40:01.708 --> 40:03.543
Please hold.

40:03.470 --> 40:05.387
Zoe Barnes.

40:06.628 --> 40:10.216
Anywhere you want. On my way.

40:10.071 --> 40:12.280
I'm gonna have to call you back.

40:25.591 --> 40:28.719
So sorry. I couldn't catch a cab.
I had to take a train...

40:28.592 --> 40:30.634
Just before you left my house...

40:30.553 --> 40:32.221
Think back...

40:32.154 --> 40:33.946
What were we discussing?

40:35.032 --> 40:36.741
The president's legislative agenda.

40:36.673 --> 40:38.591
Specifically.

40:38.512 --> 40:40.638
Education. Was I right?

40:40.553 --> 40:43.179
Do the math, miss Barnes.

40:43.073 --> 40:46.284
- He needs a bill.
- Sponsored by...

40:46.154 --> 40:49.866
- You?
- Be smarter than that.

40:51.834 --> 40:53.628
- Somebody with legitimacy.
- Good.

40:53.555 --> 40:56.806
And who screams legitimacy
and education?

40:56.674 --> 40:59.551
- Donald blythe?
- Correct. The problem is...

40:59.435 --> 41:02.395
He's an old-school
tax-and-spend liberal.

41:02.275 --> 41:04.986
Walker ran as a moderate.

41:06.195 --> 41:08.573
You think blythe would talk to me?

41:09.436 --> 41:11.563
He doesn't have to.

41:12.956 --> 41:15.375
Wait. We're in
a very gray area...

41:15.277 --> 41:18.029
Ethically, legally...
Which I'm okay with...

41:17.918 --> 41:20.503
I just love this painting.
Don't you?

41:21.877 --> 41:24.296
We're in the same boat now, Zoe.

41:24.197 --> 41:25.739
Take care not to tip it over.

41:25.678 --> 41:28.638
I can only save one of us from drowning.

41:54.119 --> 41:56.622
He announces his education
initiative on Monday.

41:56.522 --> 41:58.941
- Half of the address is based on...
- I understand.

41:58.842 --> 42:01.176
- Do we need to take it out?
- We're fine, Linda.

42:01.082 --> 42:03.542
But you just got through
saying he has to start over.

42:03.442 --> 42:05.401
I didn't choose blythe.
You did.

42:05.322 --> 42:08.074
You put him in my lap and asked
me to work a miracle, and I will.

42:07.963 --> 42:10.006
Now, have a little faith, Linda.

42:09.923 --> 42:11.506
Let me work with Donald on this.

42:11.443 --> 42:14.154
I know what can be
accomplished in 100 days.

42:14.044 --> 42:17.088
All right, Frank.
We're counting on you.

42:16.965 --> 42:18.673
Good.

42:19.924 --> 42:21.884
Now, I do have a little favor to ask.

42:21.804 --> 42:25.223
Do you think I can get
just two more tickets

42:25.084 --> 42:28.420
for my table at the Jefferson ball?

42:37.765 --> 42:41.268
- Drink?
- Uh, sure! What do you got?

42:41.126 --> 42:42.543
Whiskey. Blend.

42:42.486 --> 42:45.321
If you're offering.

42:45.206 --> 42:47.917
So... how are things

42:47.808 --> 42:49.558
in the city of brotherly love?

42:49.487 --> 42:52.281
- We're getting by.
- Oh, good.

42:52.168 --> 42:54.252
Good. Oh, I'm sorry.

42:54.168 --> 42:57.254
- I made that neat. Did you want...
- No, this is perfect.

43:06.528 --> 43:10.866
So, it seems you've been
a bit irresponsible.

43:10.690 --> 43:12.440
What?

43:12.370 --> 43:14.455
Don't play dumb with me, Peter.

43:14.370 --> 43:16.496
Save it for the ethics committee.

43:17.849 --> 43:20.519
Drink up. You could use
a little courage right now.

43:20.410 --> 43:22.911
You're not having one.

43:22.810 --> 43:26.063
It's a bit early in the day for me.

43:27.651 --> 43:29.986
Is this about the other night?

43:29.892 --> 43:31.308
How do you know about that?

43:31.251 --> 43:34.044
I'm the whip.
It's my job to know.

43:33.931 --> 43:35.725
Look... look, they let me off.

43:35.652 --> 43:38.612
There's... there's no charges.
It's all taken care of.

43:38.492 --> 43:40.493
Honestly, Peter,

43:40.413 --> 43:42.122
do you really think these things

43:42.053 --> 43:43.970
just take care of themselves?

43:43.892 --> 43:46.560
You...

43:48.654 --> 43:51.363
It was just this one time,
Frank. I swear to God.

43:51.253 --> 43:53.463
Then you must hold God
in very low esteem,

43:53.374 --> 43:56.585
because we both know that's a lie.

43:56.454 --> 43:59.957
"Solicitation, controlled substances,

43:59.814 --> 44:02.190
driving under the influence."

44:02.095 --> 44:04.888
Got quite a long list of hobbies.

44:06.095 --> 44:08.556
What is it you want?

44:18.335 --> 44:24.008
Your absolute, unquestioning loyalty.

44:23.778 --> 44:25.278
Always.

44:25.217 --> 44:29.220
Do not misunderstand
what I mean by "loyalty."

44:29.057 --> 44:31.976
Anything. Name it, Frank.

44:31.858 --> 44:35.444
- You seem far too relaxed.
- I'm not.

44:35.299 --> 44:37.508
You shouldn't be.

44:39.178 --> 44:41.513
Doug'll be in touch.

44:45.460 --> 44:46.835
Hang on.

44:46.781 --> 44:48.741
Where have you been?
I've been calling you.

44:48.660 --> 44:50.577
Everybody's working double-time
in an inauguration,

44:50.501 --> 44:53.002
and you just up and disappear...

44:53.899 --> 44:56.318
Hang on.

45:01.701 --> 45:03.453
Let me call you back.

45:06.741 --> 45:09.159
- Where did you get this?
- Wrong question.

45:09.062 --> 45:12.649
The right question is, how quickly
can we get it up on the site?

45:12.502 --> 45:15.170
I have to run this past tom.

45:15.063 --> 45:16.855
Let's get legal on this.

45:16.783 --> 45:19.160
Make sure we're not breaking any laws.

45:19.063 --> 45:21.605
- You won't tell me your source?
- I can't do that.

45:21.502 --> 45:24.171
- Fine, but if legal finds even one...
- I understand.

45:24.064 --> 45:26.732
How long do you think that will take?
We should get this online right away.

45:26.624 --> 45:28.667
I'm not just going to scan
a 300-page document

45:28.584 --> 45:30.376
and put it up before we
have gone through every...

45:30.304 --> 45:33.057
- I did that already.
- The whole thing?

45:32.945 --> 45:35.070
Cover to cover.
I've got excerpts, analysis.

45:34.984 --> 45:37.319
3,000 words ready for editing.

45:38.706 --> 45:40.165
You start going over them.

45:40.105 --> 45:42.231
Get graphics. Work on
the tables, charts...

45:42.145 --> 45:44.772
The whole nine yards.

45:44.666 --> 45:46.499
Janine!

45:46.426 --> 45:48.387
What's the angle? Five words.

45:48.307 --> 45:50.474
- Far left of center.
- That's four.

45:50.386 --> 45:53.138
- Very far left of center.
- Enough to put Walker on his heels?

45:53.026 --> 45:54.652
Fuck his heels.
This'll put him on his ass.

45:54.588 --> 45:56.463
What's up?

45:56.387 --> 45:59.222
We've got a copy of the
administration's education bill.

45:59.106 --> 46:01.775
- You're going to work with Zoe and do background cover.
- Zoe Barnes?

46:01.667 --> 46:04.544
- Right here.
- Whatever she needs.

46:04.428 --> 46:06.846
- Well, shouldn't I be writing the...
- She wrote it already.

46:06.748 --> 46:09.124
And I want you to rewrite it,
then rewrite it again.

46:09.028 --> 46:11.738
- You'll help her.
- Tom, I am your chief political correspondent.

46:11.628 --> 46:13.671
Go! I want this by tomorrow.

46:13.589 --> 46:16.091
- But I need to focus on the inauguration.
- This is more important.

46:15.990 --> 46:18.158
Let's get started.

46:18.070 --> 46:20.111
"That I will
faithfully execute the office"

46:20.029 --> 46:21.865
of president
of the United States."

46:21.791 --> 46:23.792
That I will faithfully
execute the office...

46:23.710 --> 46:25.544
Power is a lot like real estate.

46:25.471 --> 46:28.889
It's all about location,
location, location.

46:28.749 --> 46:30.584
The closer you are to the source,

46:30.512 --> 46:32.221
the higher your property value.

46:32.151 --> 46:34.110
"And defend
the constitution..."

46:34.031 --> 46:36.824
Centuries from now,
when people watch this footage,

46:36.712 --> 46:39.923
who will they see smiling
just at the edge of the frame?

46:39.792 --> 46:42.460
- "So help me God."
- So help me God.

46:42.351 --> 46:44.227
Congratulations.

47:00.033 --> 47:04.453
Today... is not about
the next four years.

47:04.274 --> 47:07.527
It's about the next four decades.

47:07.394 --> 47:10.229
Now, you've placed your faith in me,

47:10.115 --> 47:12.116
and I, in turn,

47:12.035 --> 47:15.996
choose to place that faith
in our children.

47:15.835 --> 47:20.964
Our children are the key
to this nation's future.

47:20.756 --> 47:23.342
And that's why
the first order of business

47:23.237 --> 47:24.945
for this administration

47:24.876 --> 47:28.545
will be a comprehensive
education reform bill

47:28.396 --> 47:32.190
to properly fix, finance,

47:32.036 --> 47:35.289
and strengthen our nation's schools!

47:37.956 --> 47:40.500
And I pledge to you,

47:40.399 --> 47:43.610
we will have that bill
on the floor of the congress

47:43.479 --> 47:47.899
within the first 100 days
of this administration!

47:52.920 --> 47:55.339
It was so nice of you
to make this possible.

47:55.239 --> 47:57.032
- When you called me, I was...
- Oh, not another one.

47:56.961 --> 47:58.711
I'm gonna miss out

47:58.640 --> 48:01.225
on my ultimate frisbee league this week.

48:01.120 --> 48:03.538
No, I'm serious.
A few of us on budget

48:03.441 --> 48:06.402
have quite a rivalry going
with the guys on finance.

48:06.281 --> 48:08.907
It's fierce. We get physical.

48:08.801 --> 48:10.718
Anybody gets between me
and that goal line,

48:10.641 --> 48:13.894
I will take that sucker down!

48:33.083 --> 48:35.710
Donald, I've been looking
for you everywhere.

48:35.603 --> 48:38.064
Maestro, here, let me
help you out with this.

48:37.964 --> 48:40.132
I really like the work
you've done on the new draft.

48:40.045 --> 48:42.546
It's a big step forward. We're
gonna make history together.

48:42.446 --> 48:44.530
Thanks for the encouragement.
Francis, listen...

48:44.445 --> 48:46.738
I've got some ideas about
subsidies for higher education...

48:46.644 --> 48:49.354
Catherine! Hold onto
that thought, Donald.

48:49.245 --> 48:52.205
Don't you look stunt!

48:52.085 --> 48:54.962
We Southern girls clean up well
when we get out of our Daisy Dukes

48:54.846 --> 48:58.099
- and into some vera wang.
- And we Southern boys are slow with our words,

48:57.967 --> 48:59.842
but we're fast on our feet.

48:59.767 --> 49:01.518
May I have the honor?

49:01.447 --> 49:03.615
You most certainly may.

49:27.169 --> 49:29.462
- Mornin', Freddy.
- Good morning, Frank.

49:29.368 --> 49:31.870
- How's tricks?
- I can't kick.

49:31.769 --> 49:34.604
- You want to go on in?
- No. Why don't you set me up outside?

49:34.490 --> 49:36.742
Outside?
It's freezing out here.

49:36.651 --> 49:39.235
Well, a little cold never hurt anybody.

49:39.130 --> 49:41.173
Anything you say, Frank.

49:41.091 --> 49:43.343
It'll be right up.

49:43.252 --> 49:46.462
My one guilty pleasure is a good rack
of ribs, even at 7:30 in the morning.

49:46.332 --> 49:48.208
Have the whole place to myself.

49:48.131 --> 49:49.798
Freddy sometimes opens up just for me.

49:49.732 --> 49:51.984
Where I come from in South Carolina,

49:51.893 --> 49:54.394
people didn't have
two pennies to rub together.

49:54.292 --> 49:57.294
A rack of ribs is a luxury, like...

50:00.212 --> 50:03.131
Christmas in July.

50:39.295 --> 50:41.840
This web traffic's absolutely crazy.

50:45.376 --> 50:49.422
Blue Camry, D.C.
Plate number whiskey, Juliet, 0-0-2-niner

50:49.258 --> 50:51.842
is wanted in connection
to a canine hit-and-run.

50:51.737 --> 50:54.739
Code 1057, found on capital...

50:54.618 --> 50:55.994
Mmm.

50:55.939 --> 50:57.399
Do you want seconds, Frank?

50:57.339 --> 50:59.631
I'd better not.

51:00.458 --> 51:02.585
Tell you what, Freddy...

51:02.499 --> 51:04.751
Yes, I will.

51:04.660 --> 51:07.704
I'm feeling hungry today.
