01:30.331 --> 01:32.333
Look at us.

01:34.301 --> 01:36.579
When we were brothers...

01:40.169 --> 01:42.550
we wanted more.

01:45.760 --> 01:48.142
More volume.

01:50.731 --> 01:53.906
More muscles.

01:56.875 --> 01:58.497
Us three.

01:58.532 --> 02:02.881
Us kings.

02:03.813 --> 02:07.161
Us brothers.

02:24.351 --> 02:27.492
- Us family.
- Body heat.

02:27.526 --> 02:29.287
Body heat, body heat.

02:29.321 --> 02:32.048
Body heat,
body heat.

02:32.082 --> 02:35.189
Body heat, body heat.

02:35.224 --> 02:38.848
Body heat, body heat.
Body...

02:40.194 --> 02:41.644
Manny.

02:43.128 --> 02:44.923
Joel.

02:47.132 --> 02:48.547
Ma.

02:52.724 --> 02:54.415
Pops.

02:58.557 --> 02:59.869
Me.

04:20.500 --> 04:23.021
Manny. Joel!

04:26.887 --> 04:28.406
Shh.

04:59.989 --> 05:01.784
Sometimes...

05:07.479 --> 05:09.757
we wanted less.

05:17.386 --> 05:19.388
Less work.

05:23.909 --> 05:25.877
Less noise.

05:33.885 --> 05:36.094
Just this.

06:12.579 --> 06:14.201
Jonah.

06:14.235 --> 06:16.065
Come on.
What are you waiting for?

06:20.380 --> 06:22.623
Wait up!

06:25.454 --> 06:27.559
Toss it up!

06:38.639 --> 06:41.124
I call first
to be on the bed.

07:15.745 --> 07:18.265
Shake it, Papito! Come on!

07:18.299 --> 07:21.682
Come on. All right, now.

07:21.717 --> 07:23.684
Shake it
like you're rich.

07:25.686 --> 07:28.724
Snobby, snobby,
rich, rich.

07:28.758 --> 07:31.934
Get those noses up.
Shake it! Shake it!

07:33.349 --> 07:35.524
You ain't rich.

07:35.558 --> 07:38.250
Shake it like you're white.

07:38.285 --> 07:40.218
Like your ma.

07:40.252 --> 07:42.531
No rhythm.

07:44.015 --> 07:45.844
Nah, you ain't white.

07:45.879 --> 07:48.157
Now shake it like
you're Puerto Rican.

07:48.191 --> 07:50.780
Eh!

08:03.828 --> 08:06.555
Come on!

08:28.508 --> 08:31.614
I met your ma in high school.

08:31.649 --> 08:33.684
I asked her to dance.

08:34.962 --> 08:36.722
And that's how he got me.

08:36.756 --> 08:39.001
I was only 14.

08:40.485 --> 08:42.936
Yeah, you didn't look 14.

08:51.772 --> 08:54.361
I sat in his lap
just like this.

08:54.395 --> 08:57.502
And I remember asking,
"Can I get pregnant from this?"

08:57.537 --> 08:59.884
And he said, "What, this?"

08:59.918 --> 09:03.819
And there wasn't no way we could
stay in Brooklyn after that.

09:04.923 --> 09:07.167
Then out popped Manny.

09:09.307 --> 09:11.792
- Boo!
- And then Joel.

09:15.313 --> 09:16.970
And then you.

09:18.627 --> 09:20.905
What time do we got?

09:34.746 --> 09:36.714
Look at me.

09:46.240 --> 09:48.208
Watching them.

09:59.737 --> 10:01.601
Flying.

10:05.432 --> 10:07.227
Fearless.

10:25.279 --> 10:27.972
You went so far.

10:29.490 --> 10:31.803
Was that scary?

10:34.219 --> 10:37.222
I'll never let anything
happen to you.

10:48.337 --> 10:50.650
You grew up with
all these lakes and rivers.

10:50.684 --> 10:55.655
You got two brothers that swim
like a couple of goldfish.

10:56.725 --> 10:59.003
How come you don't swim?

10:59.037 --> 11:01.695
You don't know
how to swim neither.

11:01.730 --> 11:05.319
Yeah, well, no one
ever swam in Brooklyn.

11:08.357 --> 11:11.084
Then where did Paps
learn how to swim?

11:12.499 --> 11:14.432
I don't know.

11:19.299 --> 11:21.370
You ready?

11:27.479 --> 11:29.896
You're coming with me.

11:29.930 --> 11:32.726
Come on.
I got you, bud.

11:32.761 --> 11:34.107
- Come on. You too.
- You crazy?

11:34.141 --> 11:35.764
No, no. You're coming.
Come on.

11:35.798 --> 11:38.318
- I'm okay. I'm good, I'm good.
- Come with me.

11:38.352 --> 11:39.802
Come on. It'll be fine.

11:39.837 --> 11:41.735
- I got you. Come on.
- Okay.

11:41.770 --> 11:44.704
Hold on to me.
Come on.

11:44.738 --> 11:47.914
Hold on tight.
Hold on tight.

11:48.673 --> 11:50.192
All right.

11:50.226 --> 11:52.125
Time to learn.

11:53.229 --> 11:56.646
Does that feel good?

11:56.681 --> 11:59.753
Hold on. You good?

11:59.788 --> 12:01.617
See?
You're safe.

12:01.651 --> 12:03.723
Hold me tight.

12:26.573 --> 12:29.334
We've gone too far.
Take us back.

12:29.369 --> 12:32.061
He's got to learn to swim.

12:33.407 --> 12:35.789
You both got to
learn to swim.

13:33.191 --> 13:36.367
How else you gonna learn?

13:37.782 --> 13:39.473
Huh?

13:57.664 --> 14:00.253
I need to talk to your ma. Take
your brothers out for a sec.

14:00.287 --> 14:05.016
- And do what?
- Get out of the car, coño!

14:19.859 --> 14:21.308
You okay, bro?

14:21.343 --> 14:24.104
You fuckin' baby, him!
Goddamn it.

14:24.139 --> 14:26.175
He will learn to swim

14:26.210 --> 14:28.143
like normal people
learn to swim!

14:28.177 --> 14:31.146
Did he learn to swim?
Did he learn to swim?

15:29.204 --> 15:31.206
Why do you have to do this?

16:52.080 --> 16:53.633
Wake up!

16:56.946 --> 16:59.259
Where's he going?

17:06.955 --> 17:09.097
Listen.

17:09.131 --> 17:11.685
Do me a favor.

17:13.239 --> 17:16.414
I need you to be good
and quiet around your ma.

17:17.277 --> 17:19.314
There was a, uh...
an emergency.

17:19.348 --> 17:23.180
Yeah, I had to take her
to the dentist tonight.

17:25.527 --> 17:27.770
Manny, come here.

17:30.773 --> 17:34.156
- Hold on to this for me.
- Is she hurt?

17:34.191 --> 17:36.365
She just needed some, uh...

17:36.400 --> 17:38.678
her wisdom teeth taken out.

17:39.817 --> 17:42.199
The dentist was, uh...

17:42.233 --> 17:44.580
punching on her a little.

17:46.134 --> 17:49.344
That's how they loosen up the
teeth before they rip them out.

17:52.001 --> 17:55.177
But the dentist said
she'll be better by tomorrow.

17:56.109 --> 17:58.456
It's my birthday tomorrow.

17:59.561 --> 18:01.114
Well...

18:01.149 --> 18:03.668
happy birthday, old man.

19:56.919 --> 19:59.750
It's his birthday.

20:03.029 --> 20:04.927
Happy birthday.

20:05.756 --> 20:07.896
He's ten.

20:10.795 --> 20:13.212
He'll leave me now.

20:13.902 --> 20:15.386
Ten.

20:15.421 --> 20:17.871
What's that supposed to mean?

20:17.906 --> 20:20.771
When you boys turned ten,
you left me.

20:20.805 --> 20:23.843
That's what big boys do.

20:23.877 --> 20:25.327
I won't.

20:27.502 --> 20:30.263
Good.

20:30.298 --> 20:32.748
Will you get up today?

20:41.170 --> 20:43.311
How do I look?

20:46.175 --> 20:48.039
- Purple.
- Crazy.

20:48.074 --> 20:49.524
Tore up.

21:05.367 --> 21:08.301
What did he do to me?

21:08.336 --> 21:09.958
He punched you in the face.

21:13.202 --> 21:15.204
To loosen up your teeth.

21:27.216 --> 21:30.737
You think that's funny
when men beat on your mother?

21:37.848 --> 21:40.540
Promise me
you'll stay nine forever?

21:41.817 --> 21:43.785
How?

21:43.819 --> 21:45.683
Simple.

21:49.480 --> 21:51.482
You're not ten.

21:53.450 --> 21:55.693
You're nine plus one.

21:55.728 --> 21:58.869
Next year you'll be
nine plus two.

21:58.903 --> 22:01.803
Like that. Forever.

22:01.837 --> 22:03.183
Why?

22:03.218 --> 22:05.462
Because...

22:07.464 --> 22:09.776
when they ask you
how old you are,

22:09.811 --> 22:13.262
you'll be telling them that
no matter how old you are,

22:13.297 --> 22:16.335
you are your ma's
baby boy.

22:18.233 --> 22:21.961
And if you stay my baby boy,
then I'll always have you.

22:29.934 --> 22:33.352
You feel that?

22:36.631 --> 22:39.668
I remember
your heart inside me.

22:41.429 --> 22:43.948
Ticking like a bomb.

23:05.073 --> 23:06.971
That hurt!

23:24.782 --> 23:27.406
Now that Paps was gone...

23:30.201 --> 23:32.687
she stopped eating.

23:38.140 --> 23:40.073
Stopped cooking.

23:44.181 --> 23:46.148
Stopped getting out of bed.

23:47.909 --> 23:50.670
Not knowing what's to come,

23:50.705 --> 23:54.294
why, that's...
that's pretty scary.

23:54.329 --> 23:57.608
But I have heard the future.

23:57.643 --> 24:01.785
All of you hear the future
in a dream.

24:01.819 --> 24:05.409
It's God's whispering.

24:05.444 --> 24:07.515
Put your hands on your ears

24:07.549 --> 24:10.794
and block out the noise
and feel

24:10.828 --> 24:15.005
the magic of God
inside you.

24:15.039 --> 24:17.732
We are the magic of God.

24:19.285 --> 24:20.942
Us three.

24:22.012 --> 24:23.807
Us three.

24:28.259 --> 24:31.297
His name, Papito.
Your mother smell like pizza.

24:31.331 --> 24:34.473
Give it to your teacher
for luck, for luck,

24:34.507 --> 24:36.405
for luck, for luck,
for luck.

24:36.440 --> 24:38.649
One, two, three, four,
five, six,

24:38.684 --> 24:40.996
seven, eight, nine.

25:14.651 --> 25:17.032
Soy sauce.

25:43.852 --> 25:47.580
If you stay still and cool,
you won't be hungry.

25:47.615 --> 25:50.928
God, I'm starving.

25:50.963 --> 25:53.759
Don't answer the phone.

25:54.794 --> 25:57.763
But what if it's Paps?

26:00.489 --> 26:03.527
- Ring, ring.
- Hello?

26:03.562 --> 26:08.152
Mami, how come you didn't answer
the phone when I call you?

26:09.533 --> 26:11.570
'Cause you sound so ugly.

26:13.641 --> 26:15.643
Here try it.

26:15.677 --> 26:18.024
- Yo, yo, what's up?
- Woman!

26:18.059 --> 26:20.026
This is your husband
talking to you right now.

26:20.061 --> 26:23.340
- You better act right.
- What do you want from me?

26:25.273 --> 26:27.482
Dígame, Mami, talk to me.

26:27.516 --> 26:30.830
I've been missing you.
Been missing you real bad.

26:30.865 --> 26:33.833
I know, Mami, I know.

26:35.386 --> 26:37.354
Ring ring.

26:38.251 --> 26:40.288
I'm sorry.

26:41.772 --> 26:44.292
Nah, baby, I'm sorry.

27:05.589 --> 27:07.280
Hello?

27:09.420 --> 27:11.284
Hello?

27:13.286 --> 27:15.392
What are we going to do?

27:41.073 --> 27:42.522
Come on.

27:42.557 --> 27:44.145
Body heat.

27:46.457 --> 27:48.736
Body heat, body heat,

27:48.770 --> 27:51.255
body heat,
body heat,

27:51.290 --> 27:53.533
body heat, body heat,

27:53.568 --> 27:55.812
body heat,
body heat,

27:55.846 --> 27:58.021
body heat, body heat,

27:58.055 --> 28:01.334
body heat,
body heat...

28:08.272 --> 28:10.412
Come on. Let's go.

28:10.447 --> 28:12.380
Tuck in your shirt.

28:12.414 --> 28:14.693
Come on, tuck it in.

28:20.768 --> 28:23.184
Divide and conquer.

28:26.118 --> 28:28.845
- Can I get a pack of Newports?
- Really?

28:28.879 --> 28:31.468
What? It's not for me.
It's for my mom.

28:31.502 --> 28:33.228
You kidding me?

28:33.263 --> 28:35.748
You want me to go
home empty-handed to my mom?

28:35.783 --> 28:39.303
You know what she's gonna do to me if
I don't come home with her Newports?

28:40.580 --> 28:43.929
- I'm not gonna sell you anything
without an ID. -Please.

28:43.963 --> 28:47.070
- I'm just gonna walk away and put it in
my back pocket. -It's not gonna happen.

28:47.104 --> 28:49.417
- Fine, let me have Marlboros then.
- Fuck!

28:49.451 --> 28:51.419
Jonah!
Come on! Come on!

28:53.697 --> 28:56.286
No!

29:26.385 --> 29:28.283
Jonah, look.

29:34.531 --> 29:36.395
Shh. Quiet.

29:37.948 --> 29:41.572
Yo, take off your shirt
and use it as a basket.

29:41.607 --> 29:43.920
Grab as much as you can.

29:55.379 --> 29:57.726
Stop!

29:57.761 --> 29:59.452
Cut it out!

29:59.487 --> 30:02.386
- It's a grenade.
- No, it's food. Help out!

30:02.421 --> 30:05.320
Damn, why you always
telling me what to do?

30:06.011 --> 30:08.530
All right, come on.

30:08.565 --> 30:11.913
Oh, shit.
Jonah! Jonah!

30:22.613 --> 30:24.408
You guys hungry?

30:38.250 --> 30:40.528
This is my grandson,
Dustin.

30:50.089 --> 30:53.506
You two boys want to help me?
Come on inside.

31:16.012 --> 31:19.670
Cut it into a cross.

31:19.705 --> 31:23.191
That way you break up the poison
and kill the itch.

31:34.478 --> 31:36.446
You like Iron Maiden?

31:36.480 --> 31:38.206
Who is she?

31:56.845 --> 32:00.090
I got to show you guys
something.

32:15.450 --> 32:17.073
What is this?

32:17.107 --> 32:20.352
Locusts.

32:20.386 --> 32:23.044
Oh! What the fuck?

32:24.459 --> 32:26.323
Oh, my God!

32:26.358 --> 32:29.223
Where did you get
this shit?

32:29.257 --> 32:31.915
Philly.
I can get you one if you want.

32:31.950 --> 32:35.470
Oh, yeah,
I would love to have one.

32:35.505 --> 32:39.198
I'm not kidding you, bro.

32:39.233 --> 32:41.994
She's got big boobs, bro.

32:44.583 --> 32:46.619
Yo, she's getting it.

32:48.000 --> 32:50.934
This shit is crazy!

32:52.004 --> 32:53.799
Ooh, shit!

32:53.833 --> 32:56.043
Whoa, that's nasty, bro.

32:57.906 --> 33:01.910
- What the f...
- Damn.

33:01.945 --> 33:04.430
They keep spinning.

33:11.886 --> 33:13.992
Yo, that was fucked up.

33:14.026 --> 33:15.786
Nah, that was just fucking.

33:24.519 --> 33:27.971
Do you think Paps
will ever come back?

33:29.973 --> 33:32.907
He always comes back.

33:32.941 --> 33:35.737
Shh. Close your eyes.

35:14.422 --> 35:17.080
What the fuck
are you doing?

35:17.115 --> 35:19.151
Nothing.

35:19.186 --> 35:22.396
- You touch my bag?
- No.

35:22.430 --> 35:26.227
You're so fucking weird.

35:41.794 --> 35:44.625
After she got up...

35:48.249 --> 35:50.182
he started calling more.

36:21.144 --> 36:23.215
What if he's having
a heart attack?

36:23.250 --> 36:24.699
What heart?

36:24.734 --> 36:28.703
I'll get it.

36:45.341 --> 36:47.895
Ring, ring.

36:47.929 --> 36:49.759
Manny, come on.

36:50.932 --> 36:53.935
Try. Come on.

36:55.109 --> 36:57.284
Come on!

37:56.895 --> 37:59.000
Don't move, don't move.
Stay still.

37:59.035 --> 38:00.899
All right, all right.

38:00.933 --> 38:03.384
This is the best
haircut you're gonna get

38:03.419 --> 38:05.731
in your life.

38:05.766 --> 38:07.768
We'll see.

38:07.802 --> 38:09.735
What did you say?

38:10.840 --> 38:12.324
Nothing.

38:21.264 --> 38:23.887
Why did you leave?

38:25.958 --> 38:28.133
Your Titi Milly called.
I had to...

38:28.167 --> 38:31.378
I had to get back
to the city.

38:32.344 --> 38:34.484
Why did you come back?

38:45.253 --> 38:47.394
What do you think?

38:59.267 --> 39:02.512
Come on, get up.
We're both working tonight.

39:02.547 --> 39:05.964
You're coming with me.

39:05.998 --> 39:08.449
Now that Paps was back...

39:12.073 --> 39:14.386
he wanted more of us.

39:19.046 --> 39:20.737
More of her.

39:20.772 --> 39:22.946
Hey, Papito, come here.

39:22.981 --> 39:24.327
Come here.

39:24.362 --> 39:26.122
Get in.
Switch it on.

39:26.156 --> 39:28.952
Duro, duro! There you go.

39:31.403 --> 39:34.372
More family.

39:34.406 --> 39:37.064
All right, all right,
all right.

39:37.098 --> 39:40.447
I don't know.
It don't work no more.

39:43.104 --> 39:44.865
And we wanted it too.

39:44.899 --> 39:47.315
It's him. It's him. Wait.

39:47.350 --> 39:49.973
He got it! He got it!

39:58.810 --> 40:00.846
Papi!

40:09.268 --> 40:10.649
Well, boys,

40:10.684 --> 40:13.238
say hi to the newest member
of the family.

40:13.272 --> 40:16.517
Let's go!

40:18.001 --> 40:20.970
- Sounds good, right?
- Yeah!

40:24.145 --> 40:26.182
Well, Mami,

40:26.216 --> 40:28.495
what do you think?

40:29.806 --> 40:32.430
How many seats
does it have?

40:33.534 --> 40:36.226
It's a truck.
It don't got seats.

40:36.261 --> 40:38.056
It's got a bench.

40:39.713 --> 40:41.853
How many seatbelts?

40:43.510 --> 40:45.546
Why you got to be
like that?

40:45.581 --> 40:48.342
Me?

40:48.376 --> 40:49.999
Me?

40:50.033 --> 40:53.658
How many fuckin' kids
do you have, huh?

40:53.692 --> 40:56.626
How many? How many
fuckin' kids and a wife?

40:56.661 --> 40:58.801
- Uh-huh. -This truck
that doesn't even have

40:58.835 --> 41:00.906
enough seatbelts
to protect your family.

41:00.941 --> 41:02.943
- This fucking big-dick truck!
- Okay. Okay.

41:02.977 --> 41:05.635
- Big-dick truck! What's wrong with you?
- Okay. Okay!

41:05.670 --> 41:08.293
- Why you got to get something like this?
- You win! You win!

41:08.327 --> 41:10.019
You win! You win!

41:10.053 --> 41:13.988
I hear you! I hear you!
You win, okay?

41:14.023 --> 41:16.094
You win!

41:16.128 --> 41:18.027
You win. You win.

41:21.720 --> 41:25.828
I'll take the truck
back tomorrow, and I'll...

41:25.862 --> 41:29.314
I'll trade it in
for a fucking...

41:29.348 --> 41:31.385
minivan.

41:31.419 --> 41:35.423
Get you a fat-old-lady car.
Huh?

41:35.458 --> 41:37.495
Is that what you want?

41:37.529 --> 41:39.669
To be a fat old lady?

41:44.847 --> 41:47.470
But tonight
we have a truck.

41:47.505 --> 41:49.645
Okay?

41:50.784 --> 41:53.165
So tonight
we'll go for a ride.

43:58.808 --> 44:01.915
Yo, move over.

44:05.712 --> 44:08.059
I gotta pee.

44:17.206 --> 44:20.278
You all going to
be men soon, huh?

44:22.936 --> 44:25.421
We're gonna need to get some
new boys to take your place.

44:25.455 --> 44:29.011
Yeah, that's exactly what
I need in this house:

44:29.045 --> 44:30.944
more men.

44:43.715 --> 44:45.717
Hey.

44:45.752 --> 44:48.133
Where'd the boys go?

44:49.445 --> 44:53.207
I don't know. I
guess they disappeared.

45:16.161 --> 45:17.576
Okay, stop.

45:17.611 --> 45:20.165
Come on.
The boys are watching.

45:20.200 --> 45:24.100
Oh, I thought
you all disappeared.

45:24.135 --> 45:26.585
You were
supposed to look for us.

45:26.620 --> 45:30.003
I guess I found
something better.

45:30.589 --> 45:33.420
Papi.

45:33.454 --> 45:36.595
Could you get my boots
out of the closet?

45:36.630 --> 45:38.632
Oh, baby.

45:38.666 --> 45:41.669
Please?
I'm already late.

45:51.472 --> 45:53.405
Hey.

45:55.787 --> 45:57.685
We'll show him.

45:59.273 --> 46:01.862
- Shh. Are you guys ready?
- Yeah.

46:01.897 --> 46:04.796
Mami,
I can't find the boots.

46:04.831 --> 46:08.489
Hello.

46:17.740 --> 46:21.364
- We got you!
- Tickle him!

46:25.506 --> 46:27.094
Get him!

46:43.283 --> 46:46.355
You were supposed
to find us.

46:46.389 --> 46:49.599
Yeah. You were
supposed to find us!

46:49.634 --> 46:51.981
Why didn't you find us?

46:52.016 --> 46:55.295
Because you're bad, bad, bad,
bad, bad, bad!

46:55.329 --> 46:59.402
Bad, bad, bad!

47:28.707 --> 47:30.917
Are you kids crazy?

47:30.951 --> 47:32.884
- Listen, bitch!
- Bitchy bitch.

47:32.919 --> 47:34.506
Bitchy bitchy bitch!

47:34.541 --> 47:35.818
- Bitch!
- Bitch!

47:35.853 --> 47:39.132
Who knows us?

47:39.166 --> 47:41.099
Body heat. Body heat.

47:41.134 --> 47:43.999
- Body heat. Body heat.
- Us three.

47:44.033 --> 47:46.518
Body heat. Body heat.

47:46.553 --> 47:49.004
Body heat.
Body heat.

47:49.038 --> 47:50.798
Us brothers.

47:50.833 --> 47:52.870
O Father, O Lord.

47:52.904 --> 47:54.699
We are lost in the desert.

47:54.733 --> 47:59.117
Please take us to our freedom
and take away all evil.

47:59.152 --> 48:01.913
Dear Lord.
Please take away Manny.

48:01.948 --> 48:04.433
- This is serious!
- This is bullshit!

48:04.467 --> 48:06.573
Ow! Fuck!

48:09.231 --> 48:11.854
Who knows them?

48:11.889 --> 48:13.821
Wait up.

48:18.447 --> 48:20.518
Joel!

48:22.347 --> 48:24.211
Manny?

49:12.639 --> 49:14.606
Come on.

49:20.302 --> 49:22.166
Come on.

49:44.326 --> 49:45.948
Here.

49:50.608 --> 49:52.610
It's like Coke.

49:53.714 --> 49:56.096
My mom loves it.

49:58.823 --> 50:00.998
Where is she?

50:02.689 --> 50:04.622
She's in Philly.

50:04.656 --> 50:08.488
When I get enough money,
I might head back home.

50:12.906 --> 50:14.666
You'd like Philly.

50:14.701 --> 50:17.945
There are Mexican people
like you there.

50:17.980 --> 50:20.086
I'm not Mexican.

50:22.847 --> 50:25.022
More than me.

51:09.928 --> 51:11.206
Yo!

51:11.240 --> 51:13.346
Jonah, I fucking see you.

51:16.590 --> 51:18.282
Wait up.

51:19.248 --> 51:21.457
Paps is waiting for us.

51:21.492 --> 51:23.321
Come on.

51:28.637 --> 51:31.674
Yo, what the fuck
were you doing?

51:44.963 --> 51:48.415
All right, we're here.
Come on, come on, come on.

51:51.453 --> 51:54.214
Move your stuff over there.
Stop kicking it.

51:54.249 --> 51:57.183
- Manny, can you move over here?
- Why?

51:57.217 --> 51:59.564
You know why.

52:00.600 --> 52:02.119
Come on.

52:28.973 --> 52:30.768
Hey, Paps.

52:30.802 --> 52:32.079
Mm?

52:32.114 --> 52:35.842
I like sleeping in a bed.

52:36.636 --> 52:38.293
I know.

52:38.327 --> 52:40.847
I know. Me too.

52:40.881 --> 52:42.055
Me too.

52:42.089 --> 52:44.126
Come on.

53:04.422 --> 53:07.701
Why is that light
in a cage?

53:15.053 --> 53:18.195
So it don't fly away.

53:29.896 --> 53:32.278
It's a funny thing.

53:32.312 --> 53:36.178
The other day when I was cutting your
hair, you know what I was thinking?

53:38.629 --> 53:40.838
Goddamn.

53:40.872 --> 53:43.323
I got me a pretty one.

53:45.049 --> 53:47.465
How'd that happen?

54:50.942 --> 54:52.668
Get up, get up. Come on!
We're late! We're late!

54:52.703 --> 54:54.601
My supervisor's going to
be here any minute.

54:54.636 --> 54:56.603
Take your brothers out to the
truck, Get under the covers,

54:56.638 --> 54:59.226
and wait there until I come
and get you, okay? Come on!

55:10.583 --> 55:11.894
Morning.

55:13.240 --> 55:15.864
Hurry, hurry, hurry!

55:18.970 --> 55:20.386
These yours?

55:20.420 --> 55:23.043
That's what
my wife keeps telling me.

55:23.078 --> 55:25.667
Well...

55:27.393 --> 55:29.671
At least you're, uh,

55:29.705 --> 55:31.880
only half as ugly
as your daddy is.

55:31.914 --> 55:35.849
Listen, man. Why don't
you and I go have a talk, huh?

55:39.957 --> 55:43.409
Manny, take your brothers and go
to the truck. Go, go, go, go.

55:46.343 --> 55:48.379
I had nowhere to take 'em.

55:49.898 --> 55:53.108
My wife works at night.
I had no choice.

55:53.142 --> 55:55.110
I'm supposed to say
I didn't see three little kids

55:55.144 --> 55:57.768
just come out the building
at 5:00 in the morning?

55:57.802 --> 55:59.942
What the fuck?
What the fuck?

55:59.977 --> 56:01.703
I need this job.

56:01.737 --> 56:04.326
You've had it in for me
from day one.

56:04.361 --> 56:06.052
Don't give me that stuff.

56:06.086 --> 56:08.468
I only have it in for you because
you don't do your fucking job.

56:08.503 --> 56:10.401
It's not our fault.

56:10.436 --> 56:13.024
It's always our fault.

56:13.059 --> 56:15.475
This is the one time
I brought my kids, man.

56:15.510 --> 56:18.202
- Oh, shit!
- That's what you gotta do!

56:18.236 --> 56:20.480
Goddamn it!

56:47.507 --> 56:50.027
A-are you fired?

56:53.479 --> 56:55.619
What do you think?

56:56.413 --> 56:58.000
Hmm?

57:07.147 --> 57:09.529
What the fuck?

57:25.925 --> 57:27.823
No!

57:30.447 --> 57:32.483
Fuck!

58:42.588 --> 58:45.556
No more work!

58:46.661 --> 58:48.870
No more floor!

58:50.734 --> 58:53.081
No more coffee cups!

58:53.115 --> 58:55.221
No more coffee cups!
No more coffee cups!

58:55.255 --> 58:57.637
No more coffee cups!
No more coffee cups!

59:00.260 --> 59:03.022
No more crying!

59:07.682 --> 59:10.201
No more crying!

59:11.099 --> 59:13.273
No more crying!

59:13.308 --> 59:16.794
No more crying!

01:00:13.333 --> 01:00:15.025
Come on.

01:00:20.340 --> 01:00:22.135
What happened?

01:00:23.999 --> 01:00:25.311
Uh...

01:00:29.073 --> 01:00:31.938
Never gonna escape this.

01:00:36.425 --> 01:00:38.496
Never.

01:00:38.531 --> 01:00:41.948
Not us, not them.

01:00:43.398 --> 01:00:45.676
Never gonna escape this.

01:00:49.784 --> 01:00:52.890
He's just tired, baby.

01:01:47.151 --> 01:01:49.775
What is he doing?

01:01:52.812 --> 01:01:54.780
Maybe he's digging a pool.

01:01:54.814 --> 01:01:58.335
Or a tunnel.

01:01:58.369 --> 01:02:01.718
Nah, I think
he's digging a trench.

01:02:01.752 --> 01:02:04.548
Ain't no trench.

01:02:04.582 --> 01:02:06.653
Digging a grave.

01:02:08.414 --> 01:02:10.105
Whose grave?

01:02:10.140 --> 01:02:12.832
How am
I supposed to know?

01:02:12.867 --> 01:02:15.076
Probably Ma's.

01:02:16.491 --> 01:02:18.769
Or maybe yours.

01:03:11.684 --> 01:03:13.306
Where is he?

01:03:14.514 --> 01:03:16.309
He dug a trench.

01:03:17.517 --> 01:03:20.141
Joel thinks it's a grave.

01:03:22.522 --> 01:03:24.628
He dug a grave.

01:03:24.662 --> 01:03:28.011
- He dug a what?
- A grave.

01:04:07.533 --> 01:04:10.053
It's like she did that.

01:04:11.778 --> 01:04:13.677
Did what?

01:04:13.711 --> 01:04:15.817
Made it rain.

01:04:17.370 --> 01:04:20.408
That hole, it's magic.

01:04:37.183 --> 01:04:38.944
Shit.

01:05:56.469 --> 01:05:59.058
Paps dug a grave.

01:06:04.029 --> 01:06:06.272
It was my grave.

01:06:54.527 --> 01:06:56.909
What the hell?

01:06:59.015 --> 01:07:01.983
What the fuck
is wrong with you?

01:07:03.122 --> 01:07:06.401
Yo, I told you
he was fucked up.

01:07:09.887 --> 01:07:12.994
Bro, you're disgusting.

01:07:18.172 --> 01:07:21.830
You're right,
you're right, you're right.

01:07:21.865 --> 01:07:23.867
How many fucking
jobs can you lose?

01:07:23.901 --> 01:07:26.628
Paps got the truck fixed.
He brought it back.

01:07:26.663 --> 01:07:30.943
Why do you have to do this?

01:07:34.774 --> 01:07:38.226
Stop fuckin' pushing me!
I swear to God...

01:07:38.261 --> 01:07:40.642
You don't push me!

01:08:38.975 --> 01:08:42.600
Hey.
Get your things.

01:08:43.981 --> 01:08:46.294
- Why?
- Don't question me.

01:08:47.951 --> 01:08:50.126
Come on.

01:09:12.182 --> 01:09:15.046
We can go anywhere.

01:09:17.256 --> 01:09:20.156
Where do you guys
want to go?

01:09:30.027 --> 01:09:32.444
What about Spain?

01:09:36.586 --> 01:09:39.968
You know, in Spain,
all the boys look like you.

01:09:40.002 --> 01:09:44.318
- That'd be nice, right?
- Yeah.

01:09:46.423 --> 01:09:48.701
Yeah.

01:10:16.039 --> 01:10:20.526
We can go home if you want to,
but we don't have to.

01:10:26.325 --> 01:10:28.362
We can leave him.
We can do that.

01:10:28.396 --> 01:10:31.227
But I need you to tell me
what to do.

01:10:38.268 --> 01:10:41.651
Jesus! You think this is easy?
Say something.

01:10:42.928 --> 01:10:45.171
Something.

01:11:12.578 --> 01:11:16.168
I thought we were finally
going somewhere.

01:12:05.562 --> 01:12:08.220
Look at them.

01:12:09.325 --> 01:12:11.361
Growing up.

01:12:17.850 --> 01:12:20.405
- Yo, check this out.
- Where did you get that?

01:12:20.439 --> 01:12:23.477
Sold Pap's cross
to a kid in my class.

01:12:23.511 --> 01:12:25.996
Paps is gonna kill you
when he finds out.

01:12:26.031 --> 01:12:27.584
Fuck Paps.

01:12:37.698 --> 01:12:40.321
Who will they be?

01:12:55.647 --> 01:12:58.201
Where are we going?

01:12:58.235 --> 01:13:00.376
You'll see.

01:13:09.730 --> 01:13:11.559
- You said you like her.
- No, I didn't.

01:13:11.594 --> 01:13:13.216
- Yes, you did
- You like her.

01:13:13.250 --> 01:13:15.149
Nah, I said she likes me,

01:13:15.183 --> 01:13:17.116
and you said,
"I like her."

01:13:17.151 --> 01:13:19.015
No, I didn't.

01:13:20.050 --> 01:13:22.915
You don't get no girls.

01:13:22.950 --> 01:13:25.124
Jonah don't get
no girls neither.

01:13:25.159 --> 01:13:27.955
Boy, shut up.

01:13:27.989 --> 01:13:30.751
You don't even know
what you're talking about.

01:13:32.511 --> 01:13:34.824
Oh, my God!

01:13:41.451 --> 01:13:43.729
Oh. Look at
the little bitch.

01:13:43.764 --> 01:13:46.836
He's crying now?
He's crying, go to Mommy?

01:13:46.870 --> 01:13:48.838
Ah, don't be
such a little bitch.

01:13:48.872 --> 01:13:50.874
- Bitchy bitch.
- Bitchy bitch.

01:13:50.909 --> 01:13:52.428
Bitchy bitchy, bitchy,

01:13:52.462 --> 01:13:53.877
Bitchy bitchy,
bitchy, bitchy, bitch.

01:13:53.912 --> 01:13:55.465
Jonah,

01:13:55.500 --> 01:13:57.881
You are such
a little bitch.

01:14:25.150 --> 01:14:28.843
- Where did he go?
- Motherfucker took my bag!

01:15:19.515 --> 01:15:22.518
Hold on a sec.

01:15:26.487 --> 01:15:28.662
- Hello?
- Is Jonah here?

01:15:28.696 --> 01:15:30.215
Jonah who?

01:15:30.249 --> 01:15:32.251
My younger brother.

01:15:32.286 --> 01:15:34.944
I haven't seen him.

01:15:37.084 --> 01:15:39.086
I'll kill that
fucking kid when I see him.

01:15:39.120 --> 01:15:40.812
All right.

01:16:16.019 --> 01:16:18.884
You can stay the night
if you want.

01:16:32.277 --> 01:16:34.072
How much do you need?

01:16:34.935 --> 01:16:37.213
For what?

01:16:37.247 --> 01:16:39.146
To go to Philly.

01:16:40.250 --> 01:16:42.149
I don't know.

01:16:42.183 --> 01:16:44.220

01:16:48.189 --> 01:16:49.846

01:16:54.506 --> 01:16:57.267

01:21:22.153 --> 01:21:23.499
Jonah.

01:21:25.639 --> 01:21:28.055
Where were you?

01:21:29.815 --> 01:21:31.300
Jonah?

01:21:36.822 --> 01:21:38.376
