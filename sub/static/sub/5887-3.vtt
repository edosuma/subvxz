You killed the ad.

00:04.402 --> 00:05.951
<i>You killed everything.</i>

<i>She's the kind of girl</i>

00:10.866 --> 00:11.887
What?

00:11.967 --> 00:12.985
Don and I signed Chevy.

00:13.053 --> 00:13.818
Don who?

00:13.900 --> 00:16.157
Our collective ex-wife
who still receives alimony?

00:16.331 --> 00:17.588
I agree with Jim.

00:18.698 --> 00:19.724
Do you still love Megan?

00:19.807 --> 00:21.018
Of course I do.

00:21.090 --> 00:23.397
Why don't you just tell her that
you don't want to move to California?

00:23.483 --> 00:26.078
I will continue to answer your phone
and keep you up to date.

00:26.426 --> 00:28.023
That's all I ask for.

- Dawn Chambers.
- I'm glad I caught you.

02:10.774 --> 02:12.811
I need ribbon
for my typewriter.

02:12.848 --> 02:14.615
It's a Coronet.

02:14.649 --> 02:18.520
And I have letterhead, but I
could use a ream of onionskin.

02:18.555 --> 02:21.828
- Okay. - And I wrote a letter
to Fritz over at Leica.

02:21.863 --> 02:24.364
I'm going to need
an airmail envelope.

02:24.398 --> 02:26.735
I can get these
sent over to you right now.

02:26.769 --> 02:30.275
- Just bring them with you.
- Mr. Draper, I'm swamped.

02:30.310 --> 02:32.112
<i>I have to get a schedule out</i>
<i>for a shoot.</i>

02:32.146 --> 02:34.451
So you can come a little later.
What are you shooting?

02:34.486 --> 02:36.724
- Mountain Dew.
- Oh.

02:36.758 --> 02:38.393
What is it?

02:38.428 --> 02:42.233
Um, it's called
"Invisible Boy."

02:42.268 --> 02:43.669
It's this kid--

02:43.704 --> 02:45.275
Ginsberg finally
got that through.

02:45.309 --> 02:47.143
I guess so.

02:47.178 --> 02:51.253
Anyway, Mr. Draper, I can get a
messenger to you in 20 minutes,

02:51.287 --> 02:52.789
unless you're going out.

02:52.824 --> 02:54.961
Obviously I didn't
make any plans.

02:54.995 --> 02:56.697
I was expecting you
to come over.

02:56.731 --> 02:58.667
Were there any calls?

02:58.701 --> 03:01.240
- <i> ( phone ringing )</i>
- Just Mr. Alan Silver

03:01.275 --> 03:03.344
<i>from the Paul Kohner Agency</i>
<i>in Los Angeles.</i>

03:03.379 --> 03:05.613
Can you get him on the line?

03:05.648 --> 03:08.118
I'm sorry, my phone
is ringing off the hook.

03:08.152 --> 03:11.353
I hope it's okay.
He says you have his number.

03:11.388 --> 03:12.922
Or I can give it to you again.

03:12.957 --> 03:15.093
No, Dawn, I want you
to call him.

03:15.127 --> 03:17.297
I, uh--
can you hold?

03:33.251 --> 03:35.319
Don Draper for Alan Silver.

03:36.921 --> 03:39.088
Don.
Glad I caught you.

03:39.123 --> 03:40.925
I was beginning
to give up hope.

03:40.959 --> 03:42.761
How can I help you?

03:42.795 --> 03:46.001
<i>It's a bit of a casting issue.</i>

03:46.035 --> 03:47.769
I don't know if I
can help you with that.

03:47.804 --> 03:50.473
Well, it has to do
with our girl.

03:50.507 --> 03:53.176
And I'm probably overreacting,

03:53.210 --> 03:55.980
but you're the closest thing
to a manager

03:56.014 --> 03:58.850
and, let's face it, you
probably have more influence.

03:58.884 --> 04:00.417
( laughs )
You better.

04:00.452 --> 04:02.853
Just get to it, Alan.

04:02.888 --> 04:05.521
Megan went into an audition

04:05.555 --> 04:10.091
and performed adequately
from what I can tell

04:10.125 --> 04:12.159
and by the time she got
to the parking lot

04:12.194 --> 04:13.893
decided to call casting

04:13.927 --> 04:16.425
and ask if she could come back
in and do it differently.

04:16.459 --> 04:18.026
So she's persistent.

04:18.060 --> 04:22.297
On Sunday she got
the director's number

04:22.332 --> 04:24.064
from someone in her
acting class,

04:24.098 --> 04:25.966
called his home,

04:26.001 --> 04:29.505
then managed to run into him
at the Brentwood Country Mart

04:29.539 --> 04:32.206
while he was having lunch
with Rod Serling.

04:33.874 --> 04:35.241
She met Rod Serling?

04:35.276 --> 04:37.711
I don't even know
if she knew he was there.

04:37.745 --> 04:41.213
She apparently pled
her case in tears

04:41.248 --> 04:43.217
and demanded another reading.

04:43.251 --> 04:45.820
Why would she do that?

04:45.855 --> 04:47.822
It's not like I've never
seen this before.

04:47.856 --> 04:49.153
They lose their confidence.

04:49.187 --> 04:51.152
But I don't want anyone
to have that anecdote.

04:51.187 --> 04:53.222
It's best we nip this
in the bud.

04:53.256 --> 04:56.291
Well, what am I supposed to do?

04:56.325 --> 04:58.226
You know her better than I do.

04:58.260 --> 05:00.593
I tried to talk to her,
but she hung up.

05:00.627 --> 05:02.964
<i>You have to tell her to relax.</i>

05:02.999 --> 05:05.502
<i>She really is doing well</i>
<i>as the new girl in town.</i>

05:05.537 --> 05:08.071
- Yeah.
- Well, then,

05:08.105 --> 05:09.941
I don't want to take up
any more of your precious time.

05:09.975 --> 05:11.343
<i>Yeah, thank you.</i>

05:23.817 --> 05:25.816
<i>( typewriters clicking )</i>

05:28.354 --> 05:30.889
It's the Clios.
Who cares?

05:30.923 --> 05:33.258
I do. But you shouldn't
give them the power

05:33.293 --> 05:35.428
to decide who shall live
and who shall die.

05:35.462 --> 05:37.463
Stan and I are part
of the agency

05:37.497 --> 05:39.163
and Playtex is our client.

05:39.198 --> 05:41.500
We'd feel the same if it
was the other way around.

05:41.534 --> 05:43.970
Would you describe that
as patronizing?

05:44.005 --> 05:46.506
I'm not taking anything
away from anybody.

05:46.540 --> 05:50.112
But I'm not going to do better
work than St. Joseph's.

05:50.146 --> 05:51.915
Lou's finishing his call.

05:53.283 --> 05:55.683
You'll get 'em next year.

05:55.718 --> 05:58.689
I gave that account
to you when I left.

05:58.723 --> 06:00.457
I worked Playtex for years.

06:00.492 --> 06:03.457
Well, maybe you
didn't work it right.

06:04.458 --> 06:06.861
Lou:
<i>Send in the cavalry.</i>

06:16.809 --> 06:18.645
Mr. Draper.
Good morning.

06:18.679 --> 06:20.478
A weekday?
What a treat.

06:20.513 --> 06:21.813
Nice to see you, Tricia.

06:21.847 --> 06:23.616
No briefcase?

06:23.650 --> 06:25.484
I'm going to surprise my wife.

06:25.518 --> 06:28.992
I've said it before,
I hate her.

06:32.394 --> 06:33.794
What can I get you?

06:33.828 --> 06:35.594
Tomato juice.

06:37.997 --> 06:41.534
Freeze-frame as our stallion
runs through the background.

06:41.569 --> 06:43.102
The bottle appears.

06:43.136 --> 06:45.637
Announcer--
"Chevalier Noir.

06:45.672 --> 06:47.206
More horsepower."

06:47.241 --> 06:49.341
Why is there artwork?

06:49.375 --> 06:52.207
Well, I believe it really
helps if you see it.

06:52.241 --> 06:55.208
You understand every hour
he works costs money?

06:55.242 --> 06:56.675
You can't be hypothetical.

06:56.709 --> 06:58.975
- It took a second, Lou.
- Stay out of it, Rizzo.

06:59.009 --> 07:01.308
It's already done.
Would you just look at it?

07:01.343 --> 07:03.444
Who put a knot
in your pantyhose?

07:04.814 --> 07:07.448
She's upset because
I got nominated for a Clio

07:07.483 --> 07:08.883
and "Rosemary's Baby" didn't.

07:08.917 --> 07:10.885
I don't care about awards.

07:10.920 --> 07:14.052
Oh, sorry, Peggy.

07:14.086 --> 07:16.989
Jim pulled it because
St. Joseph's

07:17.023 --> 07:20.230
was still unhappy
about going over budget

07:20.264 --> 07:23.232
and all the awards
Ted's already won for them.

07:23.267 --> 07:25.067
They're upset about winning?

07:25.101 --> 07:27.171
You know clients hate awards.

07:27.206 --> 07:29.108
That's why Ogilvy
never submits.

07:29.142 --> 07:31.608
He does it for the clients.
Trust me.

07:31.642 --> 07:34.909
Wasn't Ogilvy the chairman
of the Clios last year?

07:34.944 --> 07:37.681
That's comforting--
you weren't rejected.

07:37.716 --> 07:39.283
You weren't even considered.

07:41.585 --> 07:43.852
- Are we finished?
- Sorry about that.

07:43.886 --> 07:46.755
- You want to go to color?
- Ask your boss.

07:53.397 --> 07:55.298
I'm usually by his side.

07:55.332 --> 07:56.866
The real challenge in our life

07:56.901 --> 07:58.570
has been trying to get
Rocky's attention.

07:58.604 --> 08:00.274
Rocky.

08:00.308 --> 08:03.379
I told you last time to tell
him that I'm an admirer.

08:03.413 --> 08:05.082
( chuckles )

08:05.116 --> 08:06.617
After Henry patched things up,

08:06.651 --> 08:08.886
he'd hoped to be on
the short list for AG.

08:08.920 --> 08:11.155
Attorney General.

08:11.190 --> 08:13.959
But I shouldn't be
talking about this.

08:13.993 --> 08:15.595
How are things in real estate?

08:15.629 --> 08:17.398
I'm a travel agent, Betty.

08:17.433 --> 08:20.566
But you're still going to take
that exam again, aren't you?

08:20.600 --> 08:22.403
No, it's going swimmingly.

08:22.437 --> 08:25.372
I'm in the office
three days a week now.

08:29.045 --> 08:31.781
"Wanderlust Travel."

08:31.815 --> 08:33.081
That's spicy.

08:33.116 --> 08:34.982
Take a few.
I'm sure you'll need them.

08:35.015 --> 08:36.985
Henry's secretary
takes care of all that.

08:37.020 --> 08:38.922
But she still has to
book through somebody.

08:38.956 --> 08:41.624
Trust me, it's not all about breaking
the rack rate on the hotel room.

08:41.658 --> 08:43.758
It's about perfection.

08:43.792 --> 08:46.525
One of my clients
told me that I redefined

08:46.560 --> 08:48.863
his definition of first class.

08:50.666 --> 08:53.101
Three days a week in an office.

08:53.135 --> 08:54.902
What's that like?

08:54.936 --> 08:58.307
It's a little shopping
center in Dobbs Ferry.

08:58.341 --> 09:00.610
Just a storefront, really.
Bunch of desks.

09:00.644 --> 09:02.444
Everybody's on the phone
all the time,

09:02.479 --> 09:04.579
so you have to keep
one finger in your ear.

09:04.613 --> 09:06.647
I have three phones
and no secretary.

09:06.682 --> 09:09.017
Sometimes I can't turn
my neck when I get home.

09:09.051 --> 09:11.383
Doesn't Carlton complain?

09:11.417 --> 09:12.850
He likes the money.

09:12.885 --> 09:14.886
He wants me to let the girl
go, and I probably should.

09:14.920 --> 09:16.721
Ernie and Jenny
are walking to school now.

09:16.756 --> 09:19.194
Well, Gene's a few years
away from that.

09:19.228 --> 09:21.863
Oh, your time's occupied.

09:21.897 --> 09:23.731
But for the rest of us,

09:23.765 --> 09:26.268
as they get older,
there's less and less to do.

09:26.302 --> 09:28.939
Being alone in the house
all that time.

09:28.973 --> 09:31.506
I really needed a challenge.

09:31.541 --> 09:34.844
Well, there's still plenty of
challenges ahead, believe me.

09:36.149 --> 09:39.020
Fine, I needed a reward.

09:39.054 --> 09:41.253
I thought they were the reward.

09:42.790 --> 09:45.860
I don't know.
Maybe I'm old-fashioned.

09:47.361 --> 09:50.129
Betty Draper, that is indeed
how I would describe you.

09:51.665 --> 09:53.768
I want that streusel coffee cake.
Will you split?

09:53.802 --> 09:55.805
Of course.

10:01.446 --> 10:03.779
Well, hello.
How you doing, Tom?

10:04.781 --> 10:06.414
- Randall.
- Good.

10:06.449 --> 10:08.150
Our good friends at Koss here,

10:08.185 --> 10:09.886
and frankly
I'll include myself,

10:09.920 --> 10:11.254
have a few questions for you.

10:11.289 --> 10:13.254
Love to explain anything.

10:13.288 --> 10:16.054
I think it's the media
plan we agreed upon.

10:16.089 --> 10:17.756
No.

10:17.790 --> 10:20.260
It's about this article
from a few weeks back.

10:20.294 --> 10:23.794
Yes, I've seen this, obviously.

10:23.829 --> 10:25.795
I'm very happy
with our media plan,

10:25.830 --> 10:29.429
but Grey has this computer that
they're opening up to everybody.

10:29.464 --> 10:32.064
We just thought maybe
we should look into it.

10:32.099 --> 10:33.900
Or you should.

10:33.934 --> 10:36.137
Look, may I sit down?

10:38.905 --> 10:41.937
This is a very enviable
piece of PR.

10:41.971 --> 10:45.039
Grey gets "The New York Times"
to tell all about their computer

10:45.073 --> 10:46.841
by offering their services
up to the world.

10:46.875 --> 10:50.080
But I swear, as clever
as it is, it's just PR.

10:50.114 --> 10:52.213
I'm an engineer.

10:52.247 --> 10:54.616
You can explain to me
what the difference is

10:54.650 --> 10:56.452
between their computer
and your computer.

10:56.487 --> 10:59.590
Well, computers don't think.
People do.

10:59.624 --> 11:02.191
And the data accumulated
by me and my department

11:02.226 --> 11:04.526
reflects the same national
availability of media.

11:04.560 --> 11:06.564
What we will be able
to offer soon

11:06.598 --> 11:09.033
is local data as well.

11:09.068 --> 11:12.170
We will be able to integrate local and
national markets into one report.

11:12.205 --> 11:13.639
We are developing that program.

11:13.673 --> 11:15.306
There you have it.

11:15.340 --> 11:17.106
You'll forgive me,

11:17.140 --> 11:19.774
but Grey's does sound
very impressive.

11:19.809 --> 11:21.778
They're a different
kind of agency.

11:21.812 --> 11:25.251
I wasn't even invited to this meeting
because this is about your business.

11:25.285 --> 11:27.619
Koss, that's the only name
that should be in the paper.

11:27.653 --> 11:29.153
Very well put.

11:29.187 --> 11:30.655
Tom, does that put you at ease?

11:33.295 --> 11:35.931
I'm really sorry
to put you through that.

11:35.966 --> 11:39.602
Randy warned me, but,
you know, I got to ask.

11:39.636 --> 11:41.136
( laughs )

11:41.170 --> 11:42.871
I'll walk you out.

11:42.905 --> 11:45.007
You said you wanted to poke your
head in and say hi to Peggy?

11:46.577 --> 11:49.213
It's good to see you. Got to
get you out on that boat.

11:49.247 --> 11:51.649
Thank you, Jim.
Harry, always a pleasure.

11:56.860 --> 11:58.795
What are you smiling about?

11:58.829 --> 12:00.794
Did you not call for a fireman?

12:00.829 --> 12:03.895
Why the hell is Grey Advertising
coming up in my meeting?

12:03.929 --> 12:05.830
Well, that article
could have been about us

12:05.864 --> 12:08.198
if anyone appreciated
our media department.

12:08.232 --> 12:11.204
Are you aware your
self-pity is distasteful?

12:11.239 --> 12:13.875
You know what? This
conversation is over.

12:13.910 --> 12:16.079
I'm really not interested.

12:21.354 --> 12:23.724
<i>( car approaches )</i>

12:30.863 --> 12:32.965
<i>( car door shuts )</i>

12:41.412 --> 12:42.779
Hello.

12:43.814 --> 12:47.081
You're here!
You surprised me!

12:53.123 --> 12:55.258
Maybe I got your hints.

12:55.292 --> 12:57.193
I've never, ever admitted
that I've wanted this.

12:57.227 --> 13:00.463
What happened?
Did you get fired?

13:02.533 --> 13:04.336
I just had a hankering.

13:04.370 --> 13:05.903
Oh, really?

13:05.937 --> 13:10.775
Well, an extra special
hankering you shall get.

13:19.420 --> 13:20.989
<i>( TV playing )</i>

13:21.023 --> 13:23.059
Hello.

13:23.093 --> 13:25.193
Loretta, please.

13:25.227 --> 13:26.560
They're not watching.

13:26.595 --> 13:29.829
No, I believe they're not
interested in that.

13:29.863 --> 13:31.763
Aren't you helping
Bobby with his homework?

13:31.797 --> 13:36.165
Yes, ma'am. You got to sign this
slip for Bobby's field trip.

13:38.298 --> 13:40.100
How was everyone today?

13:40.134 --> 13:42.269
They're little angels.

13:44.140 --> 13:46.442
They're looking for chaperones.
I can take Genie along.

13:46.476 --> 13:50.179
Well, if you can remember to turn
this in, I want to go along.

13:50.213 --> 13:52.280
You do?
You're gonna come?

13:52.314 --> 13:54.647
Yes.
Yes, I am.

13:54.681 --> 13:56.682
Great. It's Miss
Keyser's dad's farm.

13:56.716 --> 13:59.486
She grew up there and they
make butter and grow eggs.

13:59.520 --> 14:01.423
Well, we'll see all that,
won't we?

14:01.458 --> 14:03.093
I'm going to change.

14:08.630 --> 14:10.765
I really needed that.

14:11.868 --> 14:13.869
I really needed this.

14:15.339 --> 14:17.007
So I could have been anyone.

14:17.042 --> 14:19.544
It's your own fault.

14:19.578 --> 14:22.781
I think I've been
alone too much.

14:22.816 --> 14:25.118
You have so many friends,
I can't keep track.

14:25.153 --> 14:27.455
I don't know.

14:28.791 --> 14:30.158
( sighs )

14:30.193 --> 14:33.295
It's sunny here
for everyone but me.

14:33.329 --> 14:35.564
I'm walking around
in a cloud of "no."

14:38.169 --> 14:40.371
Megan, you know,

14:40.405 --> 14:42.808
they're getting rejected, too.

14:44.077 --> 14:47.881
Maybe they're just
handling it better.

14:49.282 --> 14:50.984
That's a terrible thing to say.

14:51.018 --> 14:53.957
I'm speaking from experience.

14:53.991 --> 14:57.562
You can't let it
erode your confidence.

14:59.098 --> 15:02.134
And you can't get
angry or desperate.

15:02.169 --> 15:04.404
I know that.

15:04.438 --> 15:07.508
I know all that.

15:07.542 --> 15:09.677
What the hell
are you doing here?

15:11.214 --> 15:13.017
Alan called me.

15:13.052 --> 15:16.258
What?
He called you?

15:17.794 --> 15:20.695
I'm your husband.
He was worried.

15:20.729 --> 15:23.064
Great, now I have to fire him.

15:23.099 --> 15:25.765
What am I gonna do? How am
I gonna find someone new?

15:25.800 --> 15:28.404
You don't have to fire anyone. You just
have to stop acting like a lunatic.

15:29.607 --> 15:32.972
What did he say?
You know what? Forget it.

15:33.006 --> 15:36.842
So you came out here to what?

15:36.876 --> 15:38.745
Pull me out of a bathtub
where I slit my wrists?

15:38.779 --> 15:40.312
I'll admit it, I was worried.

15:40.347 --> 15:42.546
Well, thanks
for the visit, Daddy.

15:44.215 --> 15:46.682
I was stupid for thinking
you could possibly miss me.

15:46.717 --> 15:48.581
I do miss you.

15:50.584 --> 15:52.251
No, you don't.

15:52.286 --> 15:54.654
I should fly in
and surprise <i> you.</i>

15:56.054 --> 15:58.721
Yeah, that's a scary
thought, isn't it?

15:58.755 --> 16:00.656
- No.
- Really?

16:00.690 --> 16:02.259
You're never there when I call

16:02.293 --> 16:04.696
and you always
have to call me back.

16:04.730 --> 16:05.964
And it's always quiet.

16:05.998 --> 16:08.464
Where is it quiet
in that office?

16:08.499 --> 16:10.398
And I've never even
heard a typewriter.

16:10.432 --> 16:12.233
- That's not true.
- Yes, it is true.

16:12.267 --> 16:16.134
I'm sorry I had to
interrupt your love affairs

16:16.168 --> 16:17.702
with the disaster of my career.

16:17.737 --> 16:19.237
Megan, sit down.

16:19.271 --> 16:21.705
I was your secretary, remember?

16:21.739 --> 16:23.639
I know what you're like
when you're left alone.

16:23.674 --> 16:26.512
- You're acting crazy.
- So where are you?

16:26.546 --> 16:29.313
Why can't I reach you?
Who's your new girl, Don?

16:29.348 --> 16:32.018
There is no one else.

16:35.589 --> 16:37.389
I've been at home.

16:39.126 --> 16:41.796
They put me on leave, okay?

16:41.830 --> 16:43.600
You lost your job?

16:45.037 --> 16:47.337
Don't worry,
I'm still getting paid.

16:47.372 --> 16:50.509
I don't give a shit.
When did this happen?

16:50.543 --> 16:52.209
Right after you left.

16:55.243 --> 16:57.177
They fired you last year?

16:57.211 --> 16:59.812
I didn't get fired.
That's the thing.

16:59.846 --> 17:03.249
I don't know if they want
me or they don't want me.

17:03.283 --> 17:05.650
Why didn't you tell me?

17:05.684 --> 17:07.519
Because I messed up

17:07.553 --> 17:10.256
and I didn't want you
to know until I fixed it.

17:10.290 --> 17:12.423
And there is no one else.
I've been good.

17:12.457 --> 17:14.022
I haven't even been
drinking that much.

17:17.328 --> 17:20.230
So with a clear head,

17:20.263 --> 17:22.762
you got up every day
and decided

17:22.797 --> 17:25.232
that you didn't
want to be with me?

17:29.238 --> 17:31.573
Megan.

17:31.608 --> 17:34.175
( sighs )

17:37.582 --> 17:41.118
Mm, I'm not walking
out of my own house.

17:42.320 --> 17:44.485
So that means
you have to leave.

17:46.089 --> 17:47.823
Have you calmed down?

17:49.292 --> 17:52.492
I'm not kidding around.

17:52.527 --> 17:55.964
I want you to call a cab,
get on a plane, go home.

18:00.466 --> 18:03.002
I don't want you to worry
about me anymore.

18:03.037 --> 18:04.637
Stop it.

18:04.672 --> 18:07.106
It's okay, Don.

18:07.140 --> 18:09.007
This is the way it ends.

18:10.776 --> 18:13.311
It's going to be so much
easier for both of us.

18:33.098 --> 18:35.399
- <i> ( intercom buzzes )</i>
- <i> I have Mr. Grady calling.</i>

18:35.434 --> 18:37.200
<i>He's from</i>
<i>"The Wall Street Journal."</i>

18:37.234 --> 18:39.401
Really?
Put him through.

18:42.742 --> 18:44.742
Harold Crane here.

18:46.746 --> 18:48.545
We have a situation.

18:48.580 --> 18:51.315
I know this isn't the message,

18:51.350 --> 18:54.789
but we can all learn something
from the funeral business.

18:54.823 --> 18:56.625
Did you tell "The Wall Street
Journal" to give me a call?

18:56.660 --> 18:59.360
( sighs )
I felt badly about

18:59.394 --> 19:01.826
diminishing your contributions
in this morning's meeting.

19:01.860 --> 19:04.496
And let's face it, this computer
situation is an arms race.

19:04.530 --> 19:07.064
There's no point in winning
if people don't know.

19:07.099 --> 19:09.364
Well, we're not winning.
We don't have a computer.

19:09.398 --> 19:10.831
What?

19:10.866 --> 19:12.632
Believe me, I ask for one
every Christmas

19:12.666 --> 19:14.298
and no one even bothers
to say no.

19:14.333 --> 19:17.135
Well, why did you tell
the client we do?

19:17.168 --> 19:18.867
It's semantics.

19:18.902 --> 19:21.466
We use a computer, therefore
I call it <i>our</i> computer.

19:21.500 --> 19:23.602
But it's actually
someone else's computer.

19:23.636 --> 19:26.769
And the local markets program?

19:26.804 --> 19:29.571
It's a great idea. I'm sure
someone's going to do that.

19:31.174 --> 19:35.345
You have stiff competition,
but I believe you to be

19:35.379 --> 19:38.549
the most dishonest man
I have ever worked with.

19:38.583 --> 19:41.180
I didn't call
"The Wall Street Journal."

19:41.214 --> 19:43.249
Kill it.

19:44.384 --> 19:46.351
<i>( phone ringing )</i>

19:46.385 --> 19:48.118
Woman:
<i>Dave Wooster's office.</i>

19:48.151 --> 19:50.620
Is Dave in?
It's Clarence Birdseye calling.

19:50.654 --> 19:52.556
<i>Just a minute.</i>
<i>Let me see if he's available.</i>

19:56.226 --> 19:57.694
Dave:
<i>Well, hello, Don.</i>

19:57.728 --> 20:00.630
Enough dancing around.
Let's have dinner.

20:00.665 --> 20:02.467
<i>How's tonight?</i>

20:02.502 --> 20:04.939
7:30.
The Algonquin.

20:11.184 --> 20:12.819
( exhales )

20:12.854 --> 20:15.322
Well, while we're digesting,

20:15.357 --> 20:17.125
perhaps you should do
a little digesting.

20:22.671 --> 20:25.339
You can look at it now or you
can put it in your pocket,

20:25.374 --> 20:28.008
but you can't use it
as a coaster.

20:29.477 --> 20:31.480
Why don't you just
tell me what's in it?

20:31.515 --> 20:33.483
Why don't you look?

20:34.751 --> 20:37.621
- That's coy.
- No, that's drama.

20:37.655 --> 20:39.491
Woman:
<i>Excuse me.</i>

20:39.525 --> 20:42.695
I'm sure you caught
my eye during dinner.

20:42.729 --> 20:46.466
I was only staring because I
believe we know each other.

20:48.035 --> 20:50.239
Emily Arnett?

20:53.611 --> 20:56.315
I'm afraid I can't place you.

20:57.918 --> 21:00.620
I'm sorry. I don't mean
to interrupt anything.

21:00.655 --> 21:02.657
Would you like to join us?

21:04.326 --> 21:06.060
No, I'm off to bed.

21:06.094 --> 21:08.460
Hopefully I'll be able
to sleep.

21:08.494 --> 21:11.227
I'm on the top floor
right next to the elevator.

21:12.929 --> 21:15.031
Well, it's a pleasure
to meet you.

21:15.065 --> 21:17.033
Have a good night.

21:19.868 --> 21:21.703
Who was she?

21:21.737 --> 21:23.872
Fellas, there's no need
for the hard sell.

21:23.906 --> 21:26.275
We had nothing to do with that.

21:26.309 --> 21:28.711
I wish I'd thought of it.

21:30.581 --> 21:33.249
Should we get another drink or
do you have someplace to be?

21:37.857 --> 21:39.923
( chuckles )

21:44.933 --> 21:47.069
( knocks )

21:49.871 --> 21:51.339
Hello.

21:51.373 --> 21:52.874
What are you doing here?

21:52.908 --> 21:55.076
Are you alone?

21:55.110 --> 21:57.378
For the time being.

22:01.916 --> 22:04.288
I came by because I had
a quick question.

22:04.323 --> 22:06.290
- Shoot.
- How do you sleep at night?

22:06.325 --> 22:09.159
You know what?
I called you at Christmas.

22:09.195 --> 22:11.532
I'm sorry I opened the door.
I was expecting a BLT.

22:11.567 --> 22:13.635
Why would I want to talk
to you when you fired me?

22:13.670 --> 22:17.136
I got the message.
"Merry Christmas, love, Judas."

22:18.771 --> 22:20.773
What is this?

22:21.841 --> 22:23.740
That's a nice offer.

22:23.775 --> 22:25.908
They're really trying to make it
sound like it's not a demotion.

22:25.942 --> 22:28.110
So I take the job?
That's your advice?

22:28.145 --> 22:29.311
If that's what you want to do.

22:29.346 --> 22:31.279
Well, I know what you want me to do.
Go away.

22:31.313 --> 22:32.813
I guess you don't remember

22:32.847 --> 22:35.082
I started that company.
I had to talk you into it.

22:35.116 --> 22:37.987
I guess you forgot I found you
at the bottom of a fur box.

22:38.021 --> 22:39.720
I would never have
done that to you.

22:39.755 --> 22:42.386
Oh, come on. Don't be
a big baby about it.

22:42.421 --> 22:44.822
You were a disaster.
We did you a favor.

22:44.857 --> 22:46.591
<i>The man who talked to Hershey?</i>

22:46.625 --> 22:49.158
I've seen that man wandering the
streets with a sandwich board

22:49.193 --> 22:50.727
saying
"The end is near."

22:50.762 --> 22:53.063
- So I have my answer.
- I didn't know the question?

22:53.098 --> 22:54.528
You want to come back?
Come back.

22:56.665 --> 22:58.099
I miss you.

22:58.133 --> 22:59.401
<i>( knocking on door )</i>

22:59.435 --> 23:01.904
- Who is it?
Sherry: <i> - Room service.</i>

23:06.509 --> 23:08.611
Oh.

23:08.646 --> 23:10.614
I didn't know we had company.

23:10.648 --> 23:12.549
Yeah, for once,
it's a friend of <i> mine.</i>

23:13.885 --> 23:15.919
Sherry, this is Don.

23:15.953 --> 23:17.957
I was just leaving.

23:22.163 --> 23:24.096
Come in Monday.

23:43.722 --> 23:46.794
<i>( phone ringing )</i>

23:50.765 --> 23:53.769
Megan: <i> - Hello.</i>
- It's me.

24:01.644 --> 24:02.977
Hello.

24:03.011 --> 24:05.645
I wanted to hear your voice.

24:05.679 --> 24:08.312
I don't have a lot to say.

24:08.347 --> 24:10.946
Then you can just listen.

24:10.980 --> 24:12.913
I...

24:19.686 --> 24:21.750
I shouldn't have lied to you.

24:21.784 --> 24:23.952
And I'm sorry.

24:23.986 --> 24:27.022
And I want everything
to be okay.

24:27.057 --> 24:29.323

24:31.358 --> 24:32.725
Are you there?

24:33.895 --> 24:35.496
Yes.

24:35.531 --> 24:38.430
I can see now that I wasn't...

24:39.697 --> 24:41.863
thinking clearly

24:41.897 --> 24:45.235
and I had this logic
to what I did and...

24:46.771 --> 24:49.536
Hopefully now

24:49.570 --> 24:53.106
things can be the way
we want them to be

24:53.140 --> 24:55.707
because I'm going back
to the agency.

24:55.742 --> 24:58.342
Good for you.

24:58.376 --> 25:01.145
<i>I don't know if I can undo it,</i>
<i>but I think I fixed it.</i>

25:02.983 --> 25:06.820
"I fixed it"
is you got a job out here.

25:06.855 --> 25:09.690
That's what you promised me.
That's why I'm here.

25:09.724 --> 25:12.428
I just thought that if you
found out what happened...

25:13.864 --> 25:16.599
you wouldn't look at me
in the same way.

25:18.969 --> 25:21.304
I can't believe
after all this time

25:21.338 --> 25:23.039
you don't know me.

25:23.073 --> 25:26.642
I know how I want you
to see me.

25:26.676 --> 25:30.248
Don't lie to me.

25:30.282 --> 25:32.550
Don't do that.

25:32.584 --> 25:34.917
You can't do that.

25:34.952 --> 25:38.154
I'm your wife.

25:38.189 --> 25:41.259
Stop pushing me away
with both hands.

25:45.694 --> 25:48.130
I could come back out.

25:48.165 --> 25:50.000
I have the weekend.

25:53.269 --> 25:55.338
( sighs )

25:55.372 --> 25:57.441
Not now.

25:57.476 --> 25:59.379
It's not a good idea.

26:02.713 --> 26:04.746
I love you.

26:09.814 --> 26:11.679
Good night.

26:34.735 --> 26:36.370
There's basically
Frankenstein, Dracula,

26:36.404 --> 26:39.274
Wolf Man, the Mummy, and the
Creature from the Black Lagoon.

26:39.308 --> 26:42.040
- That's quite a few.
- There's also King Kong, too,

26:42.075 --> 26:43.675
but he's not really a monster.

26:43.709 --> 26:45.645
I like all of them,

26:45.680 --> 26:48.416
but I guess Wolf Man's
my favorite

26:48.450 --> 26:49.749
because he changes into it.

26:49.783 --> 26:51.950
Dracula changes into a bat.

26:51.984 --> 26:54.685
That's true.

26:54.719 --> 26:57.053
16, 18...

26:57.088 --> 26:58.785
It's nice to see
somebody getting along.

26:58.820 --> 27:01.253
We were having a conversation.

27:02.255 --> 27:04.122
Thank you so much
for helping out.

27:04.157 --> 27:05.924
( bus thumps )

27:07.461 --> 27:09.530
Makes my job so much easier.

27:10.801 --> 27:13.069
Bobby asked
and I couldn't say no.

27:13.104 --> 27:15.440
My mom loves animals.

27:18.511 --> 27:20.276
She really likes you.

27:20.611 --> 27:23.846
Yes, well, that blouse
says she likes everyone.

28:39.992 --> 28:42.061
It's Lou, right?

28:43.296 --> 28:45.796
Oh, hello there.

28:45.830 --> 28:48.297
Good to see you.

28:49.399 --> 28:51.369
Sure.

28:51.404 --> 28:52.838
How are you, Don?

28:54.306 --> 28:55.938
Ready to get back to work.

28:55.973 --> 28:58.507
Good for you.

29:06.920 --> 29:08.785
Hello there.

29:08.820 --> 29:11.786
Oh, Don.
Look at you.

29:11.821 --> 29:13.622
- How are you?
- I'm good.

29:13.657 --> 29:15.189
It's been too long.

29:15.223 --> 29:17.523
Here I am.

29:17.557 --> 29:19.191
Why don't you let me
take that up to him?

29:19.225 --> 29:21.160
( laughs )
To Roger?

29:21.195 --> 29:23.161
No, he's not in yet.
That's mine.

29:23.196 --> 29:24.462
Do you want some?

29:24.496 --> 29:26.662
When do you expect him?
I think we have a meeting.

29:26.697 --> 29:28.796
I'm always the last to know.

29:34.400 --> 29:36.303
It's fine.

29:36.337 --> 29:37.872
I'll keep myself occupied.

29:37.906 --> 29:39.773
Great to see you again.

29:48.451 --> 29:49.886
Keep that.

29:49.922 --> 29:52.259
- Is Jim Cutler in yet?
- I think he's at breakfast.

29:52.293 --> 29:54.328
I don't care if he's in bed
with Joey Heatherton.

29:54.362 --> 29:55.963
Get him on the horn.

30:01.304 --> 30:03.004
Ginsberg:
<i>Don?</i>

30:04.708 --> 30:06.308
Is that you?

30:08.543 --> 30:10.077
Hello, Michael.

30:10.111 --> 30:12.079
Ed, come here.
Look who's here.

30:12.113 --> 30:15.415
Oh, hi, Don.
Great to see you.

30:15.449 --> 30:17.715
Boy, you smell good.

30:17.750 --> 30:19.520
Hey, you know what?
Are you busy?

30:19.555 --> 30:21.391
- What do you mean?
- Don't bother him.

30:21.425 --> 30:24.360
He'll know.
Come here.

30:24.394 --> 30:26.797
Chevalier Blanc has
started Chevalier Noir.

30:26.831 --> 30:28.698
That's "night,"
or "black."

30:28.732 --> 30:30.465
Either way, it's the
opposite of Blanc.

30:30.500 --> 30:31.967
And we're supposed
to work up print

30:32.001 --> 30:35.501
based on this voiceover
tagline, "More horsepower."

30:35.536 --> 30:38.400
And you gotta see the words, but
it ends with a freeze-frame.

30:38.434 --> 30:40.002
What does?

30:40.037 --> 30:42.438
The TV spot.

30:42.472 --> 30:45.137
Oh. I assume
you have storyboards.

30:45.172 --> 30:47.405
Exit stage left.

30:49.508 --> 30:52.609
What have you been up to, Don?

30:54.213 --> 30:55.981
Just R&R mostly.

30:56.015 --> 30:58.317
Do you want to see
the strategy?

31:00.686 --> 31:02.153
Sure.

31:07.322 --> 31:09.288
What happened to the storyboards
from Chevalier Noir?

31:09.322 --> 31:11.059
She gave them to Lou.

31:11.094 --> 31:13.294
What do I do?
Don wants to see 'em.

31:13.328 --> 31:16.130
- Don?
- Don-- Draper.

31:16.164 --> 31:17.332
Says who?

31:17.366 --> 31:19.199
Says him.
He's outside.

31:19.234 --> 31:23.067
Right now?
What's he doing here?

31:23.101 --> 31:25.235
You want I should ask him?

31:34.315 --> 31:35.783
What's he doing?

31:35.817 --> 31:37.319
Who cares?

31:37.353 --> 31:39.521
What's going on?

31:39.555 --> 31:42.256
Shh. Look.

31:44.327 --> 31:45.994
What is he doing here?

31:46.029 --> 31:48.363
Maybe he finished drying out.

31:48.398 --> 31:50.832
Meredith, we better
get back to work.

31:53.870 --> 31:55.270
Hello, Don.

31:55.304 --> 31:57.772
Hello, Stan.

31:57.806 --> 31:59.541
Where you been?
Riding the rails?

31:59.575 --> 32:02.043
- Turns out Lou's got the boards.
- It's fine.

32:02.077 --> 32:04.046
Mr. Draper.

32:04.080 --> 32:06.648
Morning, Dawn.

32:06.682 --> 32:09.620
Seems to be some lapse
in communication

32:09.654 --> 32:12.590
- regarding my return.
- No one told me.

32:12.625 --> 32:14.961
Could you just let me know
when someone tracks down Mr. Sterling?

32:14.995 --> 32:17.933
- Can I get some coffee?
- Certainly.

32:19.034 --> 32:21.003
Why don't you fellas
catch me up?

32:21.037 --> 32:22.873
You want me to get everything?

32:22.907 --> 32:24.576
Whatever you got handy.

32:24.610 --> 32:26.677
Let's start with the garbage.

32:38.093 --> 32:40.596
Children, this is my
father, Farmer Cy.

32:40.630 --> 32:43.999
You can call me Cyrus
or Cy or "Hey, mister."

32:44.033 --> 32:45.464
( laughs )

32:45.499 --> 32:47.768
If you look around,
you can see pigs

32:47.802 --> 32:49.270
and goats and chickens.

32:49.304 --> 32:51.739
And Pammy's favorite,
the horsies.

32:51.773 --> 32:53.808
We've got all the animals.

32:53.842 --> 32:56.880
<i>But this farm is mostly</i>
<i>for growing potatoes.</i>

32:56.914 --> 32:58.715
So there's not a lot
above ground.

32:58.750 --> 33:01.185
But I know you're all
here to see the cows.

33:01.219 --> 33:03.054
So why don't we walk this way?

33:05.459 --> 33:07.630
I'm sorry, ladies, but there's
no smoking in the barn.

33:07.664 --> 33:09.731
I'll be along.

33:09.766 --> 33:13.432
You're not afraid of
missing them milk the cow?

33:13.467 --> 33:15.501
I'll be done in a minute.

33:15.536 --> 33:19.040
Well, I hope no one accidentally
grabs on the wrong udders.

33:20.608 --> 33:22.375
Excuse me?

33:22.409 --> 33:24.377
Farmer's daughter needs a bra.

33:24.412 --> 33:26.643
( laughs )

33:26.678 --> 33:29.147
( clicking )

33:30.551 --> 33:32.754
- Mm-hmm.
- Do you need my lighter?

33:32.788 --> 33:34.454
Would you mind?

33:34.488 --> 33:37.222
Don?
Is that you?

33:37.257 --> 33:40.026
Boys, excuse me a minute.

33:40.061 --> 33:43.398
Don, what a pleasant surprise.

33:43.432 --> 33:44.667
You're looking well, Joan.

33:44.701 --> 33:47.237
What have you been up to?
What are you doing here?

33:47.272 --> 33:49.540
- Waiting.
- For what?

33:49.574 --> 33:51.407
You two just getting in?

33:51.442 --> 33:53.444
We had a breakfast meeting.

33:53.478 --> 33:54.846
What are you doing here?

33:54.881 --> 33:57.181
I guess I'm waiting for Roger.

33:57.216 --> 34:00.184
Oh, I see.

34:00.218 --> 34:03.256
Well...

34:03.290 --> 34:05.558
it was nice seeing you.

34:08.262 --> 34:10.797
Guess what?
Cynthia had a little boy.

34:10.831 --> 34:12.898
Edward, but we call him Eddie.

34:12.931 --> 34:15.167
Eddie Cosgrove.

34:15.202 --> 34:17.973
That's the carousel
in Central Park.

34:18.007 --> 34:19.875
Always makes me think of you.

34:19.909 --> 34:22.646
- Now I know what you'll look like bald.
- ( laughs )

34:22.679 --> 34:25.618
( knocks )
May I have a word?

34:25.652 --> 34:27.887
Don't linger in the door.

34:27.920 --> 34:29.453
I'm wearing boots.

34:29.487 --> 34:32.553
Yes, fine, dear.

34:32.587 --> 34:34.755
Did you know that
Don Draper is downstairs?

34:34.790 --> 34:36.125
Doing what?

34:36.159 --> 34:39.466
He says he's waiting for Roger.
Does that ring a bell?

34:39.500 --> 34:41.301
He shouldn't be here.

34:45.275 --> 34:47.779
So obviously I would
like to get married,

34:47.813 --> 34:50.148
but, you know, I don't
really have any savings.

34:50.183 --> 34:52.786
I mean, it doesn't make any sense
to borrow money from my parents

34:52.820 --> 34:55.359
just so I look successful
in front of hers, does it?

34:56.996 --> 34:58.763
I don't know.
That is a tough spot.

34:58.797 --> 35:00.496
What the hell
is going on in here?

35:00.531 --> 35:02.297
We were just catching up.

35:02.332 --> 35:05.799
That's nice, ladies.
You four, in my office.

35:08.536 --> 35:10.337
- We have that meeting.
- What meeting?

35:14.271 --> 35:16.138
Sorry, Don.

35:24.419 --> 35:26.451
( cow moos )

35:28.886 --> 35:31.091
Don't get no fresher than that.

35:32.092 --> 35:33.492
Who wants to try it?

35:35.060 --> 35:36.927
I will.

35:36.962 --> 35:39.699
- Really?
- Sure.

35:40.702 --> 35:42.036
See how warm it is?

35:47.673 --> 35:49.576
It's sweet.

35:58.952 --> 36:00.387
Don.

36:01.890 --> 36:03.191
Where the hell were you?

36:03.226 --> 36:06.096
- Had an early lunch.
- I can smell it.

36:06.130 --> 36:07.598
I didn't know you
were gonna beat me here.

36:07.632 --> 36:10.303
You could have told somebody.
Anybody.

36:10.338 --> 36:12.672
I don't have to tell anybody. That's
my name on the door out there.

36:12.706 --> 36:15.173
This is my agency. I'm the
president of this agency.

36:15.207 --> 36:16.906
I don't have to ask
anybody anything.

36:16.941 --> 36:18.838
You know what? I could call a holiday
for the whole office right now.

36:18.873 --> 36:21.007
I've been sitting in here
waiting for you.

36:21.041 --> 36:23.477
I'm not gonna slink out of here
with my tail between my legs.

36:23.511 --> 36:26.278
- Now call a damn meeting.
- Let me ask Joan.

36:26.312 --> 36:29.782
- Don't ask Joan.
- Wait here.

36:33.451 --> 36:35.917
Chicken salad on rye
and a Nesbitt's?

36:37.685 --> 36:40.285
Yes, thank you, Dawn.

36:49.927 --> 36:52.129
<i>( children laughing )</i>

36:54.398 --> 36:56.331
You eat. I'm going
to wash my hands.

36:56.365 --> 36:58.032
Okay.

37:02.371 --> 37:04.503
You can't sit there.
That's my mom's spot.

37:12.215 --> 37:13.749
Jim:
<i>Don?</i>

37:13.784 --> 37:15.884
Hello, Jim.

37:17.321 --> 37:18.856
I'm surprised to see you.

37:20.360 --> 37:22.393
Well, here I am.

37:23.696 --> 37:25.932
Mr. Cutler.
There you are.

37:33.980 --> 37:36.518
I can go down to the lobby
and sell newspapers,

37:36.552 --> 37:37.987
but you're still gonna pay me.

37:38.021 --> 37:40.255
- I have a two-year contract.
- Calm down.

37:40.289 --> 37:42.623
I'll find out what's going on
and I'll take care of it.

37:42.657 --> 37:45.861
What am I supposed to do? Just
hide while he sits down there

37:45.895 --> 37:47.864
cooling his heels
like Longfellow Deeds?

37:47.899 --> 37:51.266
We're going
to ask him to leave.

37:51.301 --> 37:53.001
May I?

37:55.274 --> 37:57.810
Be careful.
I've seen this before.

37:57.844 --> 37:59.376
You might want
to call security.

38:06.789 --> 38:08.221
Lot of bees over there.

38:08.256 --> 38:10.990
They live in drawers.

38:13.258 --> 38:16.025
- Where's my sandwich?
- What do you mean?

38:16.059 --> 38:18.428
There were two.

38:18.463 --> 38:20.098
I traded it.

38:20.133 --> 38:22.598
- You traded it?
- With Susie Rogers.

38:22.632 --> 38:24.899
She didn't have a sandwich.

38:24.933 --> 38:26.434
I got her gumdrops.

38:26.468 --> 38:29.072
Bobby, that was my lunch.

38:29.107 --> 38:32.042
I'm sorry.
I'll go get it back.

38:32.076 --> 38:34.245
Stop it.
It's fine.

38:34.279 --> 38:36.779
- I'm sorry.
- Sit down.

38:38.449 --> 38:42.117
I'm sorry. I swear I didn't
know you were going to eat.

38:43.618 --> 38:45.284
There were two sandwiches.

38:48.991 --> 38:51.623
- You want them?
- No.

38:51.657 --> 38:53.089
You eat them.

38:55.159 --> 38:56.461
I don't want them.

38:56.495 --> 38:58.997
Eat your candy.

39:23.021 --> 39:25.453
Your shoes.

39:25.487 --> 39:27.389
What about her?

39:27.423 --> 39:29.492
I just discovered
you're our best hope

39:29.527 --> 39:32.496
to explain why
Don Draper is downstairs.

39:32.531 --> 39:35.736
He came to me in remorse

39:35.770 --> 39:37.371
and said he's ready
to come back.

39:37.405 --> 39:40.038
Ah, I see.

39:40.072 --> 39:43.577
Well, unfortunately,
we fired him.

39:43.611 --> 39:45.146
No, we didn't.

39:45.181 --> 39:48.014
We deliberately put him on
leave in this very room.

39:48.049 --> 39:50.551
We didn't fire him.
I would never agree to that.

39:50.586 --> 39:52.788
The leave of absence
was a very clear message.

39:52.822 --> 39:55.358
We were allowing him
to preserve his dignity

39:55.393 --> 39:56.827
while seeking other employment.

39:56.861 --> 39:58.363
Ah.

39:58.398 --> 40:01.300
Well, I remember clearly
that Cutler said

40:01.334 --> 40:04.066
the leave of absence was
to give him time to think.

40:04.101 --> 40:06.436
I didn't want any more rancor.

40:06.471 --> 40:08.272
Is that what you thought?
That we fired him?

40:08.307 --> 40:10.841
Not necessarily,
but I did expect

40:10.876 --> 40:14.310
to revisit the topic
after some time as a group.

40:14.345 --> 40:17.047
Well, here we are.
Let's take a vote.

40:19.017 --> 40:20.618
- I'll speak for Ted.
- And I'll speak for Pete.

40:20.652 --> 40:23.723
All I can say is that Don
is a very talented man,

40:23.757 --> 40:25.894
but how does he fit
into everything now?

40:25.929 --> 40:28.329
This is working.

40:28.363 --> 40:30.732
Besides, we're still mopping
up the damage he's done.

40:30.766 --> 40:33.368
I do not like the way
this agency

40:33.403 --> 40:35.236
is spoken of out there.

40:35.271 --> 40:37.872
You don't think that's because our
creative is invisible right now?

40:37.906 --> 40:39.638
One nomination.

40:39.672 --> 40:41.703
Lou didn't put in anything
he couldn't tag his name on.

40:41.738 --> 40:43.337
He barely worked here
last year.

40:43.372 --> 40:45.006
Lou is adequate.

40:45.041 --> 40:48.010
I think it's more important
we discuss Harry Crane.

40:48.044 --> 40:49.711
Harry Crane?

40:49.746 --> 40:52.013
He's gone.
Anything else?

40:52.047 --> 40:55.448
This agency is too dependent
on creative personalities.

40:55.483 --> 40:57.214
You're still talking for Ted?

40:57.248 --> 40:59.383
If we want people
speaking about this agency,

40:59.418 --> 41:01.821
what they should be speaking
about is our media department.

41:01.856 --> 41:05.326
We need to invest
in a computer, period.

41:05.360 --> 41:07.828
We need to tell our clients we're
thinking about the future,

41:07.862 --> 41:09.663
not creative hijinks.

41:09.698 --> 41:11.166
Don is a genius.

41:11.200 --> 41:12.968
He's costing us a fortune.

41:13.003 --> 41:14.872
- You hate him.
- I don't.

41:14.906 --> 41:16.739
I hate what he did to Ted.

41:16.774 --> 41:20.010
Enough! This is a
financial decision.

41:20.045 --> 41:21.946
Obviously, it's not.

41:21.981 --> 41:25.087
Right now Don draws
a sizable salary

41:25.121 --> 41:26.722
and has a partnership stake.

41:26.757 --> 41:28.457
That costs more
than a computer.

41:28.492 --> 41:30.560
- He has a contract.
- He's in breach.

41:30.594 --> 41:32.794
No, he's not.
He's on <i> leave.</i>

41:32.829 --> 41:35.196
And even if we do fire him,
he's a partner.

41:35.230 --> 41:37.298
We have to buy him out.

41:38.667 --> 41:40.266
That's true.

41:40.301 --> 41:41.667
That's a big hit.

41:41.701 --> 41:44.199
As tough as it is,
I'm confident

41:44.233 --> 41:46.902
it'll be more profitable
in the long term.

41:46.937 --> 41:50.208
Since when are you allowed to use the
words "long term" in this office?

41:50.242 --> 41:52.810
It'll be 1973
before we're even.

41:52.844 --> 41:54.677
We fire him,
we lose the noncompete.

41:54.711 --> 41:56.747
You want to walk down
some hotel hallway

41:56.781 --> 41:59.717
and see Mary Wells sitting on Don's lap
the next time you go in to present?

42:05.688 --> 42:07.455
( TV playing )

42:07.489 --> 42:09.859
How was the farm?

42:11.295 --> 42:13.060
How was your day?

42:13.095 --> 42:15.161
Did you eat?

42:15.195 --> 42:17.428
I'm not hungry.

42:17.463 --> 42:20.064
I was hungry, but now I'm not.

42:22.669 --> 42:24.670
It was a long day.

42:24.705 --> 42:27.236
I'm going to give Gene a bath.

42:27.270 --> 42:29.536
Come on, Genie.

42:38.577 --> 42:41.109
What happened?

42:43.547 --> 42:45.249
I wish it was yesterday.

42:59.627 --> 43:02.362
How was your day?

43:03.597 --> 43:06.963
( chuckles )
That remains to be seen.

43:06.998 --> 43:09.100
Are you coming back?

43:09.134 --> 43:11.703
I thought so.

43:12.704 --> 43:15.004
Now I'm not so sure.

43:17.576 --> 43:20.208
Well, I can't say
that we miss you.

43:21.979 --> 43:23.981
Thank you, Peggy.

43:29.253 --> 43:31.321
( TV playing )

43:37.162 --> 43:38.797
What happened?

43:38.832 --> 43:41.736
I couldn't get it out of Bobby.

43:41.771 --> 43:45.373
It was a perfect day
and he ruined it.

43:45.407 --> 43:48.043
How is that possible, Betty?

43:52.480 --> 43:54.716
Do you think I'm a good mother?

43:55.717 --> 43:57.282
Of course.

43:59.151 --> 44:02.289
Then why don't they love me?

44:03.291 --> 44:05.190
What are you talking about?

44:05.224 --> 44:07.222
Look at him.

44:11.227 --> 44:13.697
It's just a matter of time.

44:25.565 --> 44:26.965
Mr. Draper.

44:26.999 --> 44:30.068
Yes. Dawn...

44:30.102 --> 44:31.771
can I get some coffee?

44:31.805 --> 44:34.576
Of course, but they want to see
you in the conference room--

44:34.610 --> 44:35.810
the partners.

44:40.049 --> 44:41.851
Oh.

45:09.913 --> 45:11.681
Hello, everyone.

45:12.916 --> 45:15.116
Come on, sit down.

45:18.052 --> 45:21.020
- Bert, how are you?
- Capital.

45:21.054 --> 45:22.887
Well, this is
the meeting I assumed

45:22.921 --> 45:25.220
you were gonna have
before I came, Roger.

45:26.924 --> 45:28.657
Sorry if I disrupted your day,

45:28.692 --> 45:31.159
but I've had a productive time
catching myself up with everything.

45:31.193 --> 45:33.864
Well, we've discussed it
and we've reached the conclusion

45:33.898 --> 45:35.898
that we'd like you
to come back to work.

45:38.702 --> 45:40.238
I'm pleased to hear that.

45:40.273 --> 45:42.776
But there are
some stipulations.

45:46.278 --> 45:49.178
Violation of which
will result in termination

45:49.212 --> 45:52.079
and a reabsorption
of your partnership shares.

45:53.415 --> 45:57.184
You are not allowed
to be alone with clients.

45:57.218 --> 46:00.020
You are to stick
to the script in meetings

46:00.055 --> 46:02.957
and that means the script
will be approved

46:02.991 --> 46:05.128
by the people in this room.

46:05.163 --> 46:07.029
Outside of client hospitality,

46:07.064 --> 46:09.028
there will be no
drinking in the office.

46:10.998 --> 46:13.369
You'll be in Lane's old office.

46:13.404 --> 46:15.938
And you will report to Lou.

46:31.893 --> 46:33.458
Okay.
