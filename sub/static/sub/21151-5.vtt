SHOWMANCES HAS BEEN CONTROLLING

04:47.955 --> 04:52.826
THE HOUSE.

04:52.860 --> 04:54.061
AN EPIC VETO MEETING HAS SHAKEN
UP THE GAME AND THE SUMMER OF

04:54.094 --> 04:55.696

04:55.729 --> 05:00.834
IN ITS WAKE, CHRISTMAS AND
JILLIAN NOW STAND POISED TO BE

05:00.868 --> 05:01.769

05:01.802 --> 05:03.804
SO WHO WILL BE SHOWN THE FRONT
DOOR TONIGHT?

05:03.837 --> 05:06.273
WE'LL FIND OUT BEFORE THE HOUR
IS UP.

05:06.306 --> 05:10.444
BUT FIRST, WHEN PLANNING A BLIND
SIDE IN THE BIG BROTHER HOUSE,

05:10.478 --> 05:12.346
YOU NEED TO WATCH YOUR BACK.

05:12.380 --> 05:16.450
YOU MIGHT JUST BE THE ONE
GETTING BLINDSIDED.

05:16.484 --> 05:24.992
>> THIS VETO MEETING IS
ADJOURNED.

05:25.025 --> 05:26.126
>> A STRAIGHT SHOOTER.

05:26.159 --> 05:27.060

05:27.094 --> 05:32.700
>> NOW I KNOW WHO I CAN TRUST IN
THIS HOUSE.

05:32.733 --> 05:34.134
>> CODY, THIS IS WEEK ONE.

05:34.167 --> 05:36.537
WHY ARE YOU TRYING TO MAKE THESE
MAVERICK MOVES.

05:36.570 --> 05:40.107
YOU JUST RUINED PAUL AND
CHRISTMAS' GAME BUT YOU THREW A

05:40.140 --> 05:41.409
GRENADE IN MY GAME TOO.

05:41.442 --> 05:49.950
IT'S SO SELFISH.

05:49.983 --> 05:51.118
>> I'M PISSED.

05:51.151 --> 05:51.452
THE FIRST OPPORTUNITY THAT HE
HAD TO UNDERCUT HIS TEAM, HE

05:51.485 --> 05:52.152
TOOK.

05:52.185 --> 05:52.886
WAS THAT YOUR PLAN FROM DAY ONE?

05:52.920 --> 05:54.622
ARE YOU JUST PLAYING EVERYBODY?

05:54.655 --> 05:56.990
OR AM I THE ONLY ONE ON THE OUT?

05:57.024 --> 05:59.627
>> SO IS THIS A WHOLE THING
WHERE YOU TELL PEOPLE THAT

05:59.660 --> 06:03.063
YOU'RE GOOD AND THEN YOU'RE NOT
GOOD OR ARE YOU JUST GOING TO

06:03.096 --> 06:03.931
IGNORE.

06:03.964 --> 06:05.032
>> I WANTED PAUL OUT.

06:05.065 --> 06:06.634
>> YOU SAY THAT YOU ARE A
STRAIGHT SHOOTER WHEN YOU'RE

06:06.667 --> 06:07.901
NOT.

06:07.935 --> 06:09.269
>> I TELL YOU WHAT, YOU WANT TO
HAVE THIS CONVERSATION, DON'T DO

06:09.302 --> 06:10.471
IT IN THE OPEN.

06:10.504 --> 06:12.139
>> THEN LET'S GO UPSTAIRS.

06:12.172 --> 06:12.506
>> OKAY.

06:12.540 --> 06:13.340
>> YOU LIE.

06:13.373 --> 06:15.242
>> I DIDN'T LIE TO YOU ABOUT
ANYTHING.

06:15.275 --> 06:16.744
>> YOU TOLD ME YOU NEVER GOT THE
TEMPTATION.

06:16.777 --> 06:19.179
>> LOOK, I TRIED TO HELP YOU
GUYS, I TRIED TO TEAM UP WITH

06:19.212 --> 06:21.849
THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE HOUSE AND
I TRIED TO GIVE YOU GUYS ALL MY

06:21.882 --> 06:25.553
LOYALTY AND ALL MY TRUST AND
THIS MADE IT CLEAR TO ME WHO I

06:25.586 --> 06:26.920
CAN AND WHO I CAN'T TRUST.

06:26.954 --> 06:27.788
>> YOU DIDN'T TELL ME.

06:27.821 --> 06:29.857
>> I DIDN'T KNOW THAT THIS WAS
HAPPENING.

06:29.890 --> 06:31.859
AND I WAS COMPLETELY BLINDSIDED.

06:31.892 --> 06:34.361
THERE IS A LOT OF PEOPLE IN THIS
HOUSE THAT LOVE CHRISTMAS.

06:34.394 --> 06:39.967
AND PERSONALLY I LOVE CHRISTMAS
TOO.

06:40.000 --> 06:41.134
BUT NOT ENOUGH TO JEOPARDIZE MY
GAME WITH CODY.

06:41.168 --> 06:42.803
>> WHEN I GET STABBED IN THE
BACK, NOW IT'S TIME TO PLAY MY

06:42.836 --> 06:44.004
GAME.

06:44.037 --> 06:47.541
SO NO THANK YOU, I DON'T NEED TO
TALK TO ANY OF YOU RIT RIGHT

06:47.575 --> 06:48.742
NOW.

06:48.776 --> 06:52.746
>> GUESS WHAT, CODY, YOU TOOK A
SHOT AT ME, AND YOU MISSED.

06:52.780 --> 06:55.115
>> APPRECIATE THE LOYALTY, GUYS.

06:55.148 --> 06:58.452
>> I'M SAFE FOR THREE WEEKS AND
ALL I HAVE TO DO NOW IS STIR

06:58.486 --> 07:03.190
THIS POT, PLAY VICTIM AND CREATE
SOME ENEMIES.

07:03.223 --> 07:04.091
>> WHERE DOES THIS COME FROM.

07:04.124 --> 07:06.126
>> OKAY, DUDE, DOESN'T MATTER.

07:06.159 --> 07:07.427
>> IT'S OKAY, NOW I KNOW.

07:07.461 --> 07:09.797
>> LISTEN TO ME, I GIVE YOU MY
WORD AS A MAN.

07:09.830 --> 07:11.231
I'M WITH YOU.

07:11.264 --> 07:14.768
I'M WITH YOU AND CHRISTMASMENT I
DON'T-- THESE PEOPLE MAY THINK

07:14.802 --> 07:18.338
THAT THEY HAD ME, OKAY.

07:18.371 --> 07:21.475
>> WHAT THEY DON'T KNOW IS THAT
I'M PLAYING MY OWN GAME AND I'M

07:21.509 --> 07:27.014
PLAYING FOR ME.

07:27.047 --> 07:29.817
I'M THE FIFTH NOMINATION IN.

07:29.850 --> 07:31.251
I'M RUNNING OUT OF OPTIONS.

07:31.284 --> 07:33.721
>> RUNNING OUT OF OPTIONS, ARE
YOU KIDDING ME, YOU SAT THERE

07:33.754 --> 07:35.422
AND SAID WE CAN GO TO JURY.

07:35.455 --> 07:39.727
>> LIKE I HAVE THE DREAM TEAM IN
MIND, ME AND YOU ARE ON IT, AT

07:39.760 --> 07:41.161
LEAST TO JURY.

07:41.194 --> 07:42.663
>> DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY OTHER
PEOPLE THAT WEREN'T IN THIS

07:42.696 --> 07:43.664
GROUP.

07:43.697 --> 07:44.998
>> I KNOW WHO I CAN TRUST AND
WHO I CAN'T TRUST.

07:45.032 --> 07:48.235
>> IF YOU SIT THERE AND TELL ME
WE HAVE EACH OTHER'S BACK AND WE

07:48.268 --> 07:50.470
CAN GO TO JURY TOGETHER, I
BELIEVE YOU.

07:50.504 --> 07:53.907
>> YOU ARE NOT GOING TO TRY SHOW
TO FIND SHOW THAT I'M TRUST

07:53.941 --> 07:54.407
WORTHY.

07:54.441 --> 07:55.676
>> IT IS CHARACTER.

07:55.709 --> 07:57.811
>> STICK TO YOUR-- PLAN, STICK
TO YOUR WORD.

07:57.845 --> 07:59.913
>> I AM STICKING TO MY WORD.

07:59.947 --> 08:01.615
>> BY PUTTING ME NOT IN JURY.

08:01.649 --> 08:02.783
>> PLEETION, GIVE ME A BREAK.

08:02.816 --> 08:05.118
>> YOU GIVE ME A-- BREAK.

08:05.152 --> 08:08.622
>> NO, I UNDERSTAND WHAT NEEDS
TO HAPPEN IN THIS GAME TO MAKE,

08:08.656 --> 08:09.189
EVERYTHING HAPPEN.

08:09.222 --> 08:10.691
AND THERE IS ONE PERSON.

08:10.724 --> 08:15.028
>> SO PUTTING ME UP ON THE BLOCK
IS APPROPRIATE?

08:15.062 --> 08:17.197
>> YOU SHOULD GO V TALKED TO ME
THEN.

08:17.230 --> 08:19.833
>> I TRIED TO TALK TO ME, YOU
WOULDN'T ANSWER HAVE A

08:19.867 --> 08:21.034
CONVERSATION WITH ME.

08:21.068 --> 08:28.609
THERE WERE TWO OTHER POTENTIAL
NOMINATIONS.

08:28.642 --> 08:31.912
>> YOU DON'T-- YOU DON'T
UNDERSTAND IT.

08:31.945 --> 08:37.184
IT'S SO FAR INTO THESE
NOMINATIONS.

08:37.217 --> 08:38.018
>> OKAY.

08:38.051 --> 08:39.152
>> THAT THE GAME HAS CHANGED SO
MUCH.

08:39.186 --> 08:39.853
>> I DO UNDERSTAND IT I
UNDERSTAND THAT YOU AREN'T A MAN

08:39.887 --> 08:40.621
OF YOUR WORD, YOU'RE NOT LOYAL.

08:40.654 --> 08:43.591
>> SO SAYS YOU, CHRISTMAS.

08:43.624 --> 08:45.525
>> HAVE I-- LIED TO YOU.

08:45.559 --> 08:47.394
>> I DON'T KNOW WHAT CHRISTMAS
IS LOOKING FOR.

08:47.427 --> 08:51.031
I SIMPLY HAD TO MAKE A MOVE
AFTER PAUL PULLED HIMSELF OFF,

08:51.064 --> 08:52.833
AND CHRISTMAS, WERE YOU IT.

08:52.866 --> 08:54.702
>> SO MUCH RESPECT.

08:54.735 --> 08:57.771
>> WHATEVER, SO SAYS YOU.

08:57.805 --> 09:03.076
>> THREE WEEKS OF SAFETY.

09:03.110 --> 09:05.579
>> I DID NOT STAB YOU IN THE
BACK, CODY AND I PLAYED

09:05.613 --> 09:08.281
DIFFERENT GAMES WITHIN THE
TEMPTATION WAS MY PLAN B TO SEE

09:08.315 --> 09:10.217
IF MY GROUP WOULD STAB ME IN THE
BACK.

09:10.250 --> 09:14.888
AND GUESS WHAT, I GOT-- AND
THAT'S WHERE I DRAW MY LINE.

09:14.922 --> 09:20.093
BECAUSE A VET AGAINST JILLIAN, I
WAS FOR SURE GOING TO GO HOME.

09:20.127 --> 09:22.195
I PLAY THIS GAME WITH LOYALTY
AND TRUST.

09:22.229 --> 09:25.265
AND THAT WAS JUST TAKEN OUT,
FIRST WEEK.

09:25.298 --> 09:27.935
SO PLEASE TELL ME HOW I CAN MOVE
FORWARD.

09:27.968 --> 09:31.438
>> DOES SOMEBODY WANT TO INFORM
ME OF SOMETHING?

09:31.471 --> 09:34.675
HE'S NOT GOING TO TELL ANYTHING,
I ASKED HIM, I SAID DID I LIE TO

09:34.708 --> 09:38.045
YOU, HE WOULDN'T SAY YES OR NO,
DO YOU-- LIE IN THIS HOUSE, IS

09:38.078 --> 09:39.112
WHAT YOU GET.

09:39.146 --> 09:40.280
>> I DIDN'T KNOW.

09:40.313 --> 09:44.451
>> I GAVE YOU NOT ONLY MY TRUST
BUT MY INCYTE AS A VET AND

09:44.484 --> 09:47.420
EXPLAINED MY PARANOIA COMING
BACK AS A VET AND WHO I CAN AND

09:47.454 --> 09:48.288
CAN'T TRUST.

09:48.321 --> 09:49.823
SO NOW I HAVE TO PLAY A
DIFFERENT GAME.

09:49.857 --> 09:53.560
AND I NEED TO WATCH MY OWN BACK.

09:53.593 --> 09:54.728
>> OKAY, FINE.

09:54.762 --> 09:58.431
I MAY QUESTION WHO YOU PUT UP
AND WHY, AND STRATEGY OF THE

09:58.465 --> 09:59.366
GAME PLAN.

09:59.399 --> 10:04.004
BUT WHEN IT CAME DOWN TO IT, I
HAD HIS BACK.

10:04.037 --> 10:06.874
ALL WE HAD TO DO WAS STICK TO
THE PLAN.

10:06.907 --> 10:08.075
>> YES.

10:08.108 --> 10:10.343
>> SO WHAT IS IT, CODY, DO YOU
WANT TO PLAY YOUR OWN GAME IN

10:10.377 --> 10:12.545
THIS IS NOT A DICTATORSHIP.

10:12.579 --> 10:14.948
>> HE JUST-- ALL THE GOOD.

10:14.982 --> 10:20.187
>> YEAH.

10:20.220 --> 10:21.321
>> CODY, WHAT IN THE WORLD?

10:21.354 --> 10:22.756
WHERE DID YOU GET THIS ABSURD
IDEA TO PUT UP ONE OF OUR

10:22.790 --> 10:29.129
TEAMMATES? I DON'T EVEN KNOW IF
I CAN TRUST YOU AT THIS POINT.

10:29.162 --> 10:35.736
>> .

10:35.769 --> 10:37.537
>> WHY, LIKE.

10:37.570 --> 10:39.907
>> JILLIAN IS.

10:39.940 --> 10:42.075
>> THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT WE NEED
TO NOT DO.

10:42.109 --> 10:42.642
>> YEAH.

10:42.676 --> 10:43.844
>> WE WERE FINE.

10:43.877 --> 10:47.080
>> THIS IS WHY I DON'T
LIKE-- ALL OF A SUDDEN YOU HAVE

10:47.114 --> 10:52.953
NO IDEA THAT YOU ARE NOT.

10:52.986 --> 10:55.288
>> OKAY, LET'S HEAR IT, GUYS.

10:55.322 --> 10:56.924
THERE IS NO WAY.

10:56.957 --> 10:57.691
>> I DIDN'T KNOW.

10:57.725 --> 11:00.060
I'M SERIOUSLY, I DID NOT KNOW.

11:00.093 --> 11:01.661
>> CODY WOULDN'T TELL ME
ANYTHING.

11:01.695 --> 11:06.900
>> I WAS TRYING TO GET HIM TO
EITHER GET JASON OR ALEX.

11:06.934 --> 11:08.702
>> I AM LOOKING YOU RIGHT IN THE
EYE.

11:08.736 --> 11:09.302
I HAD NO IDEA.

11:09.336 --> 11:10.771
I AM SHOCKED.

11:10.804 --> 11:13.373
I WANTED TO CRY.

11:13.406 --> 11:14.842
BECAUSE HE JUST BLEW UP
EVERYTHING.

11:14.875 --> 11:16.810
I DONE KNOW WHY HE PUT YOU UP.

11:16.844 --> 11:21.849
>> WELL, NOW I KNOW.

11:21.882 --> 11:25.485
>> ONE OF US-- I'M DONE.

11:25.518 --> 11:29.289
>> I CAN'T PLAY THE GAME WHERE
HE IS GOING TO DO THINGS WITHOUT

11:29.322 --> 11:30.523
TELLING ME.

11:30.557 --> 11:33.126
>> CODY, WE TALKED ABOUT GOING
TO THE END OF THIS GAME TOGETHER

11:33.160 --> 11:36.964
AND YOU GO COMPLETELY ROGUE AND
PUT UP TWO NOMINATIONS, THAT YOU

11:36.997 --> 11:39.632
DIDN'T EVEN TELL ME ABOUT?

11:39.666 --> 11:43.103
>> THERE IS NO WAY THAT I CAN
TRUST YOU MOVING FORWARD, BUDDY.

11:43.136 --> 11:54.381
>> I HAD NO IDEA.

11:54.414 --> 11:58.251
>> HE DIDN'T TELL ANYBODY ABOUT
THAT TEMPTATION.

11:58.285 --> 11:59.519
>> NO.

11:59.552 --> 12:01.889
>> I KNEW YOU WERE GOING TO TRY
AND TAKE PAUL OUT, I JUST DIDN'T

12:01.922 --> 12:03.656
KNOW IT WOULD BE THIS SOON.

12:03.690 --> 12:04.925
>> HAD TO.

12:04.958 --> 12:11.899
I WATCHED THE WAY IT WORKED LAST
YEAR, IT WASN'T BY THE FACT THAT

12:11.932 --> 12:18.105
HE HELD HIS TEMPTATION FROM ALL
OF US, SHOWS EXACTLY THAT.

12:18.138 --> 12:21.942
>> I HONESTLY DON'T KNOW HOW I
FEEL RIGHT NOW.

12:21.975 --> 12:24.377
I AM ANGRY AT PAUL FOR LYING TO
ME.

12:24.411 --> 12:28.181
I'M ANGRY AT YOU FOR RUINING THE
PEACE IN THE HOUSE.

12:28.215 --> 12:32.119
>> FIVE NOMINATIONS, AND YOU
THINK THAT I SHOW PLAY A FACTOR

12:32.152 --> 12:34.221
IN, LIKE, RUINING THE PEACE?

12:34.254 --> 12:39.359
IT'S NOT ON ME.

12:39.392 --> 12:40.293
HARDLY.

12:40.327 --> 12:41.361
>> THERE IS A WHOLE OTHER SIDE
OF THE HOUSE.

12:41.394 --> 12:44.197
AND NOW YOU LOOK LIKE YOU'VE
BEEN PLAYING BOTH SIDES.

12:44.231 --> 12:48.601
DON'T WALK AWAY.

12:48.635 --> 12:53.540
CODY, CAN WE

12:53.573 --> 13:02.515
OH MY-- .

13:02.549 --> 13:07.120
>> I AM GOING TO WORK OUT, HAVE
A HAPPY FACE AND MAKE SURE

13:07.154 --> 13:10.991
THAT-- WITHIN IT'S OKAY, DON'T
WORRY.

13:11.024 --> 13:18.731
>> I'M NOT WORRIED, I'M PISSED.

13:18.765 --> 13:21.634
>> I WISH I-- ME.

13:21.668 --> 13:22.702
>> NOT BAD.

13:22.735 --> 13:24.504
>> I DID NOT SEE ANY OF THIS
COMING.

13:24.537 --> 13:26.073
BUT I STILL TRUST CODY.

13:26.106 --> 13:27.474
WHAT'S DONE IS DONE.

13:27.507 --> 13:31.544
CHRISTMAS IS A THREAT AND NOW WE
NEED TO STICK TOGETHER AND GET

13:31.578 --> 13:35.448
HER OUT OF THE HOUSE TO PROTECT
THE GROUP.

13:35.482 --> 13:38.051
>> I'M IN NOW, I'M ALL IN NOW.

13:38.085 --> 13:41.388
>> I'M VERY LEERY OF
RIDICULOUSLY ONE-SIDED DEAL I

13:41.421 --> 13:44.224
MADE WITH CODY BEFORE THE VETO
MEETING BUT THE FACT IS

13:44.257 --> 13:46.626
CHRISTMAS IS ON THAT BLOCK AND
NOT ME.

13:46.659 --> 13:49.596
SO CODY HELD UP HIS PART OF THE
BARGAIN.

13:49.629 --> 13:51.398
AND TIME WILL TELL HOW MY
RELATIONSHIP IS GOING TO WORK

13:51.431 --> 13:54.034
OUT WITH CODY LATER.

13:54.067 --> 13:55.602
>> WE GOT CHRISTMAS ALSO.

13:55.635 --> 14:02.009
>> I THINK THAT WILL BE EASY.

14:02.042 --> 14:04.211
>> I'M TRYING TO TALK TO YOU.

14:04.244 --> 14:05.778
>> YOU'RE ANGRY AT ME?

14:05.812 --> 14:09.316
>> AM I NOT ALLOWED TO FEEL
SOMETHING ABOUT THIS?

14:09.349 --> 14:11.784
>> THE ONLY THING YOU SHOULD
FEEL TOWARDS ME IS TRUST.

14:11.818 --> 14:13.720
A THOUSAND PERCENT, GUARANTEED.

14:13.753 --> 14:16.156
WOULD YOU HAVE TOOK A SHOT AT
ME.

14:16.189 --> 14:18.325
>> YOU HAD TO TAKE THE FIRST
SHOT.

14:18.358 --> 14:19.626
>> I HAD TO.

14:19.659 --> 14:22.162
>> NOW I'M JUST TRYING TO FIGURE
OUT HOW TO CLEAN UP YOUR MESS.

14:22.195 --> 14:25.232
>> THERE IS NO CLEAN UP.

14:25.265 --> 14:28.568
YOU STAY QUIET, CHILL, LAY LOW.

14:28.601 --> 14:31.671
>> THE LAST THING I NEED TO DO
IS CHILL AND LAY LOW AND THE

14:31.704 --> 14:35.742
LAST THING YOU NEED TO DO IS
KEEP STIRRING THE POT.

14:35.775 --> 14:42.882
>> JESSICA, I'M NOT STIRRING THE
POT.

14:42.916 --> 14:44.051
IT WAS MY ONLY OPTION.

14:44.084 --> 14:46.920
>> YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THAT
IT'S UP TO THE VOTE NOW.

14:46.954 --> 14:48.321
YOU DON'T GET A VOTE.

14:48.355 --> 14:49.189
>> IT IS WHAT IT IS.

14:49.222 --> 14:55.996
THERE IS NOTHING I CAN DO AT
THIS POINT.

14:56.029 --> 14:58.498
>> CAN YOU NOT DO ANYTHING
STUPID IN THE MEAN TIME.

14:58.531 --> 15:00.433
>> THERE'S NOTHING CAN I DOMENT
HAVE I DONE EVERYTHING STUPID

15:00.467 --> 15:01.969
THAT I POSSIBLY CAN.

15:02.002 --> 15:13.180
>> THAT'S TRUE.

15:13.213 --> 15:20.187
WITHIN I JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW I
HAD NO IDEA.

15:20.220 --> 15:21.688
>> THIS IS A FREE FOR ALL NOW.

15:21.721 --> 15:25.592
>> AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED, I'M
GOING TO BE A TARGET NOW BECAUSE

15:25.625 --> 15:28.028
I'M ASSOCIATED WITH CODY.

15:28.061 --> 15:29.529
BUT WE ALL ARE.

15:29.562 --> 15:31.999
WE'RE ALL ASSOCIATED WITH CODY.

15:32.032 --> 15:37.470
>> EXACTLY, MOVING FORWARD, HE
HAS TO TALK TO US.

15:37.504 --> 15:42.542
BUT WHERE IS YOUR HEAD AT,
THOUGH.

15:42.575 --> 15:43.810
>> I WILL SAY THIS, IF THE HOUSE
GOES FOR CHRISTMAS, THAT'S WHAT

15:43.843 --> 15:45.012
THE HOUSE DOES.

15:45.045 --> 15:47.780
I AM NOT GOING TO SEND CHRISTMAS
HOME BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE A

15:47.814 --> 15:48.481
REASON TO.

15:48.515 --> 15:54.087
>> I DON'T HAVE A REASON EITHER.

15:54.121 --> 15:55.955
>> DO YOU THINK SHE REQUEST
TRUST US THOUGH.

15:55.989 --> 15:57.890
>> I THINK SHE CAN TRUST ME WHAT
DO YOU THINK.

15:57.924 --> 16:02.329
I JUST THINK CHRISTMAS IS GOING
TO COME AFTER CODY, SHE WILL

16:02.362 --> 16:03.663
ASSOCIATE US TOGETHER.

16:03.696 --> 16:07.834
SO ME VOTING IT FOR CHRISTMAS TO
STAY IS PUTTING A NAIL IN MY

16:07.867 --> 16:09.102
COFFIN, SO I CANNOT.

16:09.136 --> 16:12.472
>> WELL, YOU CAN'T TRUST CODY.

16:12.505 --> 16:15.075
>> I KNOW EMOTIONS ARE HIGH
RIGHT NOW BUT I CAN'T BELIEVE

16:15.108 --> 16:18.411
EVERYBODY WANTS TO JUMP SHIP ON
CODY, IT'S OBVIOUS, WE NEED TO

16:18.445 --> 16:21.048
PROTECT THE HOH AND GET RID OF
THE THREAT.

16:21.081 --> 16:23.850
>> WHAT I'M SAYING NOW IS WHAT
IS DONE IS DONE AND WE HAVE TO

16:23.883 --> 16:24.951
MOVE FORWARD.

16:24.984 --> 16:26.653
>> I AM UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES
WANT TO HURT YOUR GAME.

16:26.686 --> 16:28.621
I WANT YOU TO GO AS FAR AS YOU
WANT.

16:28.655 --> 16:33.060
I'M JUST TELLING YOU RIGHT NOW,
I'M NOT GOING TO VET.

16:33.093 --> 16:35.828
>> THERE IS NO PUTTING A
BANDAID.

16:35.862 --> 16:39.166
EVEN IF CHRISTMAS COMES BACK
INTO THE GROUP, SHE ELIMINATES

16:39.199 --> 16:40.233
CODY, LET'S SAY THAT.

16:40.267 --> 16:42.435
THERE ARE STILL CRACKS IN THE
FOUNDATION COMPLETELY.

16:42.469 --> 16:45.338
SHE'S NOT GOING TO TRUST EVERY
SINGLE PERSON IN THIS GROUP.

16:45.372 --> 16:55.282
>> REGARDLESS OF WHAT HAPPENS,
THOUGH, CAN WE STAY TOGETHER?

16:55.315 --> 16:59.986
Julie: UP NEXT, AN UNEXPECTED
TURN OF EVENTS PUTS ONE

17:00.019 --> 17:01.321
HOUSEGUEST'S GAME IN JEOPARDY.

17:01.354 --> 17:05.058
AND LATER, IT'S THE LIVE HEAD OF
HOUSEHOLD COMPETITION.

17:05.092 --> 17:07.060
WHO WILL RISE TO POWER.

17:07.094 --> 17:08.728
STAY WITH US.

17:25.645 --> 17:29.849
.

17:29.882 --> 17:32.985
Julie: WELCOME BACK TO "BIG
BROTHER."

17:33.019 --> 17:36.323
AS EVICTION NIGHT APPROACHES,
ANTICS TURN DANGEROUS,

17:36.356 --> 17:39.392
THREATENING TO TAKE ONE NOMINEE
OUT BEFORE A SINGLE VOTE HAS

17:39.426 --> 17:43.396
BEEN CAST.

17:43.430 --> 17:44.864
YESTERDAY WAS A REALLY HARD DAY
FOR ME.

17:44.897 --> 17:47.934
I AM ON THE BLOCK AGAIN.

17:47.967 --> 17:51.003
AND YOU KNOW T COULD BE A POINT
WHERE I GET KIND OF MOAPY.

17:51.037 --> 17:54.474
BUT THAT'S NOT MY STYLE.

17:54.507 --> 17:58.278
EVERY MORNING JASON AND I GET UP
AND WE DANCE.

17:58.311 --> 18:01.648
THERE'S NO WAY A HARD DAY FROM
YESTERDAY IS GOING TO TAKE THAT

18:01.681 --> 18:03.816
AWAY FROM ME.

18:03.850 --> 18:08.721
>> OH MY GOD!

18:08.755 --> 18:09.956
>> OH, DON'T TOUCH IT, DON'T
TOUCH IT.

18:09.989 --> 18:14.261
>> I KNOW MY BODY SO WELL, THAT
OVER THE YEARS OF COMPETITION,

18:14.294 --> 18:19.399
YOU KNOW WHAT YOUR BODY IS DOING
AND YOU KNOW WHEN SOMETHING'S

18:19.432 --> 18:21.501
WRONG.

18:21.534 --> 18:27.073
>> OH SOMETHING'S SERIOUSLY
WRONG.

18:27.106 --> 18:28.708
>> OH LORD.

18:28.741 --> 18:36.583
CHRISTMAS THINKS SHE MIGHT HAVE
BROKE HER FOOT.

18:36.616 --> 18:37.116
>> OH.

18:37.150 --> 18:39.919
>> IS THAT CHRISTMAS?

18:39.952 --> 18:41.221
GO CHECK ON HER?

18:41.254 --> 18:45.158
>> WHAT JUST HAPPENED?

18:45.192 --> 18:46.025
>> CHRISTMAS, YOU ALL RIGHT?

18:46.058 --> 18:49.996
DID YOU HURT YOUR ANKLE OR IS IT
BROKEN?

18:50.029 --> 18:57.003
>> I BROKE MY FOOT.

18:57.036 --> 18:57.904
I'M NOT CRYING FROM THE PAIN OF
THE FOOT.

18:57.937 --> 18:58.505
>> IS IT INJURED OR TWEAKED.

18:58.538 --> 19:00.740
>> IT'S LIKE.

19:00.773 --> 19:02.008
>> PRETTY SWOL ENUP.

19:02.041 --> 19:08.948
>> I START CRYING WHEN I REALIZE
THAT I MIGHT HAVE TO LEAVE THIS

19:08.981 --> 19:09.582
GAME.

19:09.616 --> 19:19.659
AND I'M NOT READY FOR THAT.

19:19.659 --> 19:24.597
AND I'M NOT READY FOR THAT.

19:24.631 --> 19:26.899
>> COUNTRIES MA IS INJURED AND
OUT OF THE HOUSE FOR NOW.

19:26.933 --> 19:30.770
BUT IF I KNOW CHRISTMAS, I KNOW
SHE'S COMING BACK WITH A

19:30.803 --> 19:31.971
VENGEANCE.

19:32.004 --> 19:34.341
IT'S IN MY BEST INTEREST TO HAVE
CHRISTMAS STAY IN THIS HOUSE

19:34.374 --> 19:37.710
INSTEAD OF JILLIAN BECAUSE SHE
WANTINGS CODY AND JESSICA OUT OF

19:37.744 --> 19:38.578
THIS HOUSE.

19:38.611 --> 19:43.583
AND GUESS WHAT, SO DO I.

19:43.616 --> 19:48.020
>> OKAY N THIS ROOM, ONE, TWO,
THREE, FOUR, FIVE, SIX, THAT'S

19:48.054 --> 19:48.955
SIX, WE NEED SEVEN.

19:48.988 --> 19:50.823
BECAUSE NOBODY IN THIS ROOM
CRACKS.

19:50.857 --> 19:51.458
>> NO PROBLEM.

19:51.491 --> 19:53.059
>> NO PROBLEM.

19:53.092 --> 19:55.228
>> PAUL'S ASSUMING EVERYBODY IN
THE ROOM IS VOTING TO KEEP

19:55.262 --> 19:59.299
CHRISTMAS BUT I'M NOTMENT I'M
STAYING LOYAL TO CODY.

19:59.332 --> 20:02.435
PAUL, I WISH I COULD HELP YOU
HERE, BUT YOU NEED MORE THAN ONE

20:02.469 --> 20:07.039
VOTE.

20:07.073 --> 20:08.308
>> HE LITERALLY PISSED OFF THE
ENTIRE HOUSEHOLD AND SCREWED HIS

20:08.341 --> 20:09.409
WHOLE SQUAD.

20:09.442 --> 20:10.843
>> I THINK I HAVE ALL OF THESE
PEOPLE IN THE ROOM, AND

20:10.877 --> 20:14.080
INCLUDING ME, THAT'S SIX VOTES,
SURE JOSH SAYS THAT HE WILL VOTE

20:14.113 --> 20:17.984
TO KEEP CHRISTMAS IN, BUT CAN I
REALLY COUNT ON THIS DUDE?

20:18.017 --> 20:21.454
I JUST NEED ONE MORE SOLID VOTE
AND I THINK MY PLAN IS GOOD TO

20:21.488 --> 20:22.689
GO.

20:22.722 --> 20:25.792
>> MY ADVICE TO YOU, YOU VOTE TO
KEEP CHRISTMAS IN, AND WE CAN

20:25.825 --> 20:27.427
USE HER AS A PISTOL.

20:27.460 --> 20:29.228
>> COME ON, PAUL, SHE'S INJURED.

20:29.262 --> 20:31.464
THERE IS NO WAY I WOULD FEEL
GOOD ABOUT KEEPING HER IN THE

20:31.498 --> 20:32.699
GAME.

20:32.732 --> 20:36.068
>> DO YOU THINK JILLIAN IS EVER
GOING TO SAVE YOUR ASS AND DO

20:36.102 --> 20:37.069
YOU A SOLID.

20:37.103 --> 20:39.539
>> CHRISTMAS IS FOLT GETTING MY
VOTE.

20:39.572 --> 20:43.610
>> CHRISTMAS, AS MUCH AS YOU
LIKE HER, SHE WANTS TO DO SOME

20:43.643 --> 20:46.479
DAMAGEMENT AND NOW SHE'S.

20:46.513 --> 20:49.549
>> ME AND CHRISTMAS AREN'T THAT
CLOSE AND JILLIAN IS MY FRIEND.

20:49.582 --> 20:52.485
OF COURSE I WILL PICK MY FRIEND
OVER A STRANGER.

20:52.519 --> 20:54.987
>> I THINK I'VE DONE EVERYTHING
THAT I COULD DO.

20:55.021 --> 20:57.390
AND HOPEFULLY ONE OF THESE
PEOPLE ARE CONVINCED AND

20:57.424 --> 21:07.534
CHRISTMAS CAN STAY IN THIS
HOUSE.

21:07.534 --> 21:13.673
CHRISTMAS CAN STAY IN THIS
HOUSE.

21:13.706 --> 21:15.241
>> OH MY GOD.

21:15.274 --> 21:20.212
>> WHAT'S UP, BUNNY YNS YAY,
WELCOME BACK.

21:20.246 --> 21:25.585
>> I'M THE GIFT THAT KEEPS ON
GIVING.

21:25.618 --> 21:28.355
>> THAT'S CHRISTMAS.

21:28.388 --> 21:29.556
>> WITH A CAST?

21:29.589 --> 21:30.056
>> HI.

21:30.089 --> 21:31.991
>> ARE YOU IN PAIN.

21:32.024 --> 21:40.467
>> WELL, DEFINITELY TOUR SOME
LIGAMENTS.

21:40.500 --> 21:44.604
YEAH.

21:44.637 --> 21:48.575
>> I AIN'T GONE YET.

21:48.608 --> 21:54.080
I'M NOT MAKING CODY PUT UP
ANOTHER PERSON ON THE BLOCK.

21:54.113 --> 21:56.416
>> I'M VERY HAPPY THAT SHE'S
OKAY.

21:56.449 --> 21:59.486
HOWEVER IF CHRISTMAS STAYS IN
THIS GAME, SHE'S GOING TO DO

21:59.519 --> 22:03.189
EVERYTHING THAT SHE CAN TO GET
CODY AND I UP ON THAT BLOCK AND

22:03.222 --> 22:06.659
THAT'S NOT A RISK I'M WILLING TO
TAKE.

22:06.693 --> 22:12.965
>> SHE HAS TORN LIGAMENTS FOR
SURE.

22:12.999 --> 22:17.937
>> DID SHE GIVE ANY INDICATION
LIKE I'M HERE TO STAY OR.

22:17.970 --> 22:23.643
>> SHE WAS LIKE I'M BACK.

22:23.676 --> 22:24.143
>> CHRISTMAS!

22:24.176 --> 22:24.611
OH!

22:24.644 --> 22:30.917
>> WHAT HAPPENED?

22:30.950 --> 22:32.952
BABY.

22:32.985 --> 22:34.721

NUMBERS.

22:46.599 --> 22:50.403
Julie: UP NEXT AS THE VOTE
LOOMS, EMOTIONS RUN HIGH.

EITHER CHRISTMAS OR JILLIAN OUT

22:53.873 --> 22:56.609
THE FRONT DOOR. STAY WITH US.

23:14.627 --> 23:19.799
.

23:19.832 --> 23:22.201
Julie: WELCOME BACK TO "BIG
BROTHER."

23:22.234 --> 23:25.905
TONIGHT'S EVICTION COULD BE
DECIDED BY A SINGLE VOTE.

23:25.938 --> 23:29.509
AND A CHANGE OF HEART COULD MAKE
ALL THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WHO

23:29.542 --> 23:32.545
STAYS AND WHO GOES.

23:38.918 --> 23:41.954
>> ON A GAME LEVEL CHRISTMAS IS
A HUGE THREAT.

23:41.988 --> 23:44.156
BUT ON A PERSONAL LEVEL, WE ARE
FRIENDS.

23:44.190 --> 23:46.659
>> DO YOU WANT THAT ELEVATED?

23:46.693 --> 23:47.660

TREATED CHRISTMAS THE PAST

23:52.499 --> 23:53.666
TWO DAYS.

23:53.700 --> 23:55.401
NOT ONLY WAS SHE BACK STABBED
AND PUT ON THE BLOCKS BUT THEN

23:55.434 --> 23:58.538
SHE BREAKS HER FOOT THE FEKS DAY
AND I GIVE HER THE COLD

23:58.571 --> 23:59.772
SHOULDER.

23:59.806 --> 24:00.673
>> PERFECT, COMFY?

24:00.707 --> 24:01.808
>> COMFY.

24:01.841 --> 24:05.545
>> I'M NOT THAT GUY AND I MESSED
UP AND I TRULY AM SORRY.

24:05.578 --> 24:10.049
>> WHAT ARE YOU UP TO?

24:10.082 --> 24:10.883
>> PRETEE UNCOMFORTABLE.

24:10.917 --> 24:12.251
>> ARE YOU GOOD THERE.

24:12.284 --> 24:14.253
>> I'M GOOD.

24:14.286 --> 24:15.655

24:15.688 --> 24:18.591

24:25.164 --> 24:29.335
AND I FEEL BAD AND I AM SORRY
FOR ME BEING STAND OFFISH

24:29.368 --> 24:30.570
YESTERDAY.

24:30.603 --> 24:32.539
>> I FELL LIKE WERE YOU KEEPING
YOUR DISTANCE BECAUSE YOU HAD

24:32.572 --> 24:35.041
SOMETHING TO HIDE.

24:35.074 --> 24:39.679
>> I WAS WORRIED CUZ YOU ARE
A-- PLAYER.

24:39.712 --> 24:41.614

INTIMIDATING, STRATEGICALLY,

24:45.384 --> 24:46.152
PHYSICALLY.

24:46.185 --> 24:48.420
>> YOU CONDITION BLAME ME FOR

24:49.589 --> 24:53.593
I DONE KNOW WHAT TO SAY WHAT TO

24:53.626 --> 24:58.130
-- FILL PUT ME IN A SITUATION
WHERE I MADE WORSE ON MY OWN.

24:58.164 --> 25:01.400
INSTEAD OF COMING RIGHT AWAY AND
TRYING TO EXPLAIN MYSELF, I

25:01.433 --> 25:04.336
TRIED TO LET YOU JUST CALM DOWN
AND THEN TRY TO TALK TO YOU.

25:04.370 --> 25:05.872
>> BUT YOU DIDN'T TRY AND TALK
TO ME.

25:05.905 --> 25:07.473
>> NO, NO, I'M SAYING.

25:07.506 --> 25:11.644
>> I DON'T WANT TO GET PETTY BUT
I LITERALLY THOUGHT I BROKE MY

25:11.678 --> 25:12.779
FOOT TODAY.

25:12.812 --> 25:20.820
AND WHEN I COME IN, EVERYBODY IS
PARKED UPSTAIRS, LIKE NO

25:20.853 --> 25:21.320
CONCERN.

25:21.353 --> 25:22.755
IT JUST CONFUSED ME.

25:22.789 --> 25:26.258
AND IT REALLY HURT MY FEELINGS.

EVERYBODY DOES, I STILL DO.

25:50.983 --> 25:52.652
I ACCEPT YOUR APOLOGY.

25:52.685 --> 25:54.420
I APPRECIATE IT.

25:54.453 --> 25:58.457
IT JUST REALLY HURT MY HEART.

26:14.707 --> 26:17.076
>> I THOUGHT IT WAS A CLEAR CUT
DECISION THAT I HAD TO GET RID

26:17.109 --> 26:18.477
OF CHRISTMAS THIS WEEK.

26:18.510 --> 26:22.014
BUT NOW MY PERSONAL FEELINGS ARE
TAKING OVER MY GAME PLAY AND I'M
