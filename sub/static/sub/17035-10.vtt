WEBVTT

00:05.129 --> 00:08.096
New Year's Day, 2017...

00:08.099 --> 00:09.999
The first year in a long time

00:10.001 --> 00:12.802
no one was declaring it
the year of anything.

00:12.804 --> 00:14.770
Yep, we'd finally given up.

00:14.772 --> 00:16.505
This is dumb. Turn it.

00:16.507 --> 00:18.307
Can't. Remote's gone.

00:18.309 --> 00:20.343
Mm. My nose hurts.

00:20.345 --> 00:22.478
I think I'm getting one
of those inside pimples.

00:22.480 --> 00:24.580
Okay, seriously, who's got the remote?

00:24.582 --> 00:26.415
You know, I had this dream last night.

00:26.417 --> 00:27.883
I think it was really good.

00:27.885 --> 00:29.318
- What was it?
- For the love of God,

00:29.320 --> 00:31.520
somebody find the remote
before she remembers.

00:31.522 --> 00:32.722
You're the one sitting on it!

00:32.723 --> 00:34.490
I'm too tired to get up.

00:34.492 --> 00:36.792
So, we're just gonna watch
"Who Ate It Best"?

00:36.794 --> 00:40.196
Oh, I've seen this one.
It's the pecan pie battle.

00:40.198 --> 00:42.398
All right, that's it.
I'm finding that remote.

00:43.401 --> 00:44.800
Ooh, ahh!

00:44.802 --> 00:46.535
Ooh... chips!

00:46.537 --> 00:48.871
Oh, Axl, that is so gross!

00:48.873 --> 00:50.439
But I'm hungry, so give me some.

00:50.441 --> 00:52.274
You know, there's a coupon
for pizza in the kitchen.

00:52.276 --> 00:53.442
Somebody get up and order.

00:55.013 --> 00:56.312
You know, someone else should do it.

00:56.314 --> 00:58.848
I'm having a really hard time today.

00:58.850 --> 01:01.717
April's at her grandma's.
I'm stuck here with you people.

01:01.719 --> 01:05.354
I'm a divorcé staying with
my parents on New Year's Day.

01:05.355 --> 01:07.223
You think your 2017 is bad?

01:07.225 --> 01:09.125
When I go back to school,
I am still stuck

01:09.127 --> 01:11.894
in that fart bucket they call "The Bin."

01:11.896 --> 01:14.096
Not turning into a banner year
for me, either.

01:14.098 --> 01:16.265
Cindy had another growth spurt.

01:16.267 --> 01:19.268
Okay, clearly we're all
too pathetic to get up,

01:19.270 --> 01:21.937
so I guess we'll just have to go
with whoever has to pee.

01:21.939 --> 01:23.305
Oh, damn it!

01:23.307 --> 01:25.908
You know when someone says
"pee" I have to go.

01:28.078 --> 01:30.179
Check in the junk drawer
under the hammer.

01:30.181 --> 01:31.647
I think the coupons might be stuffed

01:31.649 --> 01:34.083
into Brick's graduation program.

01:37.587 --> 01:39.255
Let's see.

01:39.257 --> 01:41.490
Ooh, what is this?

01:41.492 --> 01:44.794
Oh, it's the Groupon I bought
for the Orson Escape Room.

01:44.796 --> 01:46.962
You guys, this expires today
and I already paid for it,

01:46.964 --> 01:48.130
so we have to go.

01:48.132 --> 01:49.398
What's an escape room?

01:49.400 --> 01:51.233
You go to this place with a team,

01:51.235 --> 01:52.501
and they lock you in a room.

01:52.503 --> 01:54.336
It has some kind of theme,
and you have to solve

01:54.338 --> 01:56.105
these puzzles and clues to get out.

01:56.107 --> 01:57.840
I think the fact that we still live here

01:57.842 --> 01:59.775
proves that we're no good
at escaping things.

01:59.777 --> 02:02.344
Look, this was the hottest
new thing 18 months ago.

02:02.346 --> 02:03.646
Oh, my God.

02:03.648 --> 02:06.482
This is what she's spending
our inheritance on?

02:06.484 --> 02:09.618
Hey, they are starving kids who
would give their right arms

02:09.620 --> 02:11.954
for the chance to pay money
to escape from a fake room.

02:11.956 --> 02:13.155
We're going.

02:16.593 --> 02:18.394
Great, now I'm a divorcé

02:18.396 --> 02:20.129
going to an escape room with my family.

02:20.131 --> 02:22.898
Congratulations, you've finally
pulled me down to your level.

02:22.900 --> 02:24.300
How long is this thing gonna take?

02:24.302 --> 02:25.267
An hour.

02:26.771 --> 02:29.271
Look, I've explained this three times,

02:29.273 --> 02:31.607
and I'm not gonna do it again...
We have a Groupon.

02:31.609 --> 02:33.008
But you know what? fine.

02:33.010 --> 02:35.377
If you guys don't want to go,
let's just go back inside.

02:35.379 --> 02:37.580
I feel like that's a trick.

02:37.582 --> 02:40.349
Don't you think I'd rather be
back on the couch watching TV

02:40.351 --> 02:42.818
instead of trying to make
memories with my stupid family?

02:42.820 --> 02:43.986
Hey, Nancy!

02:43.988 --> 02:46.555
Oh, hi, Frankie! Happy New Year!

02:46.557 --> 02:48.591
Uh, slow start for you guys, too, huh?

02:48.593 --> 02:50.459
Oh, no. We've been up for hours.

02:50.461 --> 02:51.994
It was the boys' turn to get up early

02:51.996 --> 02:53.729
and make New Year's breakfast
for the girls.

02:53.731 --> 02:56.532
Eggs, bacon, sausage...

02:56.534 --> 02:57.900
We kind of phoned it in this year.

02:57.902 --> 02:58.901
Oh.

02:58.903 --> 03:00.202
We had Pop-Tarts, 'cause we like

03:00.204 --> 03:02.505
to support American businesses.

03:02.507 --> 03:04.740
Now we're off to shovel
Mr. Jenkins' driveway.

03:04.742 --> 03:06.742
We just like to help
the elderly when we can.

03:06.744 --> 03:08.444
I mean, how can it be a happy new year

03:08.446 --> 03:10.146
if you don't do something for others?

03:10.148 --> 03:11.313
Yeah, well, helping others can be

03:11.315 --> 03:12.781
a little neglectful to your family.

03:12.783 --> 03:15.284
That's why we're going as a
family to the Orson Escape Room.

03:15.286 --> 03:18.220
Oh, we did that 18 months ago!

03:18.222 --> 03:20.422
Careful, buddy... There's a lot
of mirrors in there.

03:20.424 --> 03:21.657
I know how you get distracted.

03:21.659 --> 03:23.359
You know, uh, we Donahues,

03:23.361 --> 03:25.427
we still hold the record
for the fastest time.

03:25.429 --> 03:29.131
Yep... made it out with 1:08
left on the clock.

03:29.133 --> 03:30.533
Well, I think your record's safe,

03:30.535 --> 03:31.867
'cause we're probably gonna suck at it.

03:33.271 --> 03:35.271
That's what so great about you Hecks...

03:35.273 --> 03:36.805
You have fun no matter what.

03:42.880 --> 03:44.813
What was that? That was rude!

03:44.815 --> 03:47.249
Yeah. Did we just get dissed
by the Donahues?

03:47.251 --> 03:49.251
Take it from someone with
a lifetime of experience...

03:49.253 --> 03:50.853
That was definitely a dissing.

03:50.855 --> 03:53.222
When I said we'll probably suck
at the escape room,

03:53.224 --> 03:55.691
they're supposed to say,
"No, you'll do great."

03:55.693 --> 03:56.959
That's the social contract.

03:56.961 --> 03:58.260
"Do I look fat in these jeans?"

03:58.262 --> 04:00.196
"No, you look great." Social contract.

04:00.198 --> 04:03.899
Yeah. You said we're dumb,
and she pig-piled on it.

04:03.901 --> 04:07.102
And what was that crack
about us always having fun?

04:07.104 --> 04:08.737
First of all, we don't have fun.

04:08.739 --> 04:09.972
That's true. We don't.

04:09.974 --> 04:12.107
Then Sean with his little dig
about mirrors.

04:12.109 --> 04:14.577
I don't need to check
myself out in mirrors.

04:14.579 --> 04:16.212
I know I look good.

04:16.214 --> 04:19.548
And Dotty with her little
"1:08 remaining."

04:19.550 --> 04:21.283
- Yeah.
- She thinks she's hot stuff,

04:21.285 --> 04:22.585
but I go to school with her.

04:22.587 --> 04:24.687
She apostrophe S's
when it's supposed to be plural.

04:24.689 --> 04:26.922
You see Ron giving me that smirk?

04:26.924 --> 04:29.091
Same smirk he had when he won
the giant spatula.

04:29.093 --> 04:32.294
Well, the Donahues are going down!

04:32.296 --> 04:33.729
We are gonna get out
of that stupid room,

04:33.731 --> 04:35.514
- and we're gonna beat their time.
- Yeah!

04:35.516 --> 04:36.398
- Yeah!
- Okay.

04:36.400 --> 04:38.100
Right? Are you with me?
Come on, Hecks. Let's do this.

04:38.102 --> 04:39.301
Hands in!

04:39.303 --> 04:41.604
Ready? On the count of three.
One, two, three.

04:41.606 --> 04:43.272
- Escape room! - Go Hecks!
- Let's go! - "A Tale of Two Cities"!

04:43.274 --> 04:44.773
"A Tale of Two Cities"?

04:44.775 --> 04:46.709
I've never done a group cheer before.

04:46.711 --> 04:47.910
Oh.

04:53.015 --> 04:54.796
Welcome to Escape Orson.

04:54.823 --> 04:56.489
First of all, does anyone have
any medical conditions

04:56.491 --> 04:57.891
that would prevent them
from participating

04:57.893 --> 05:00.495
in the Escape Orson experience?

05:01.050 --> 05:03.129
We probably all have high cholesterol.

05:03.396 --> 05:05.697
Yeah, that's not on my list. Okay.

05:05.699 --> 05:08.333
The escape-room experience is
designed for groups of six,

05:08.335 --> 05:11.436
so you'll be paired with this
gentleman here... Milt.

05:11.438 --> 05:13.271
Oh. Nice to meet you.

05:13.273 --> 05:15.807
Just so you know, we're trying
to beat 1:08.

05:15.809 --> 05:19.410
But we've got a secret weapon...
our daughter, Sue, here.

05:19.412 --> 05:22.113
Any board game or puzzle
we play, she always wins.

05:22.115 --> 05:23.948
She just has a mind for it.
She's so good.

05:23.950 --> 05:25.416
No, no, no. I'm not.

05:25.418 --> 05:26.818
Yes, you are. See?

05:26.820 --> 05:28.453
Social contract. No, it's true.

05:28.455 --> 05:30.054
God gave her that one ability,

05:30.056 --> 05:31.823
and then literally nothing else.

05:31.825 --> 05:33.358
Well, sounds good to me.

05:33.360 --> 05:35.860
I'm just here for a little
excitement on my lunch hour.

05:35.862 --> 05:37.628
Your team will be entering
the laboratory

05:37.630 --> 05:39.764
of a mad scientist who's created a virus

05:39.766 --> 05:41.499
that, if released, will unleash an army

05:41.501 --> 05:42.834
of zombies upon the Earth.

05:42.836 --> 05:45.737
You'll have one hour to solve
the mystery and get out.

05:45.739 --> 05:47.305
You can ask for up to three clues,

05:47.307 --> 05:49.007
which I'll give you
on this walkie-talkie.

05:49.009 --> 05:51.409
Now, before your experience begins,

05:51.411 --> 05:54.252
I strongly suggest you use the restroom.

05:55.314 --> 05:57.115
I don't have to go. I promise.

05:57.916 --> 06:00.318
- See?
- Okay, let's do this!

06:00.320 --> 06:01.986
Those Donahues are going down!

06:01.988 --> 06:03.921
Okay, hands in. On the count of three.

06:03.923 --> 06:05.256
One, two, three.

06:05.258 --> 06:06.758
- Go Hecks!
- "The Red Badge of Courage"!

06:06.760 --> 06:07.725
Brick.

06:07.727 --> 06:10.128
Sorry. It's no "Go Hecks."

06:16.301 --> 06:18.636
Mom! Did you see that guy?

06:18.638 --> 06:20.972
That's David S. Rosenthal!

06:20.974 --> 06:22.807
The author of the
"Planet Nowhere" book series

06:22.809 --> 06:24.876
as well as the official
"Out of this World Cookbook...

06:24.878 --> 06:26.677
How to Get Your Silligan
to Eat Their Vegetables?"

06:26.679 --> 06:28.813
What? No, it's not. It's Milt.

06:28.815 --> 06:30.815
Brick, I don't think a
billionaire author is going

06:30.817 --> 06:33.251
to be doing the Orson Escape
Room on New Year's Day.

06:33.253 --> 06:34.752
Why would he be here?

06:34.754 --> 06:37.388
It's not my job to ask "Why is he here?"

06:37.390 --> 06:40.291
It's my job to freak out
that he is here!

06:41.894 --> 06:44.986
Okay, you've got one hour.
Your time starts now.

06:45.698 --> 06:47.465
- I have to pee.
- What?! -

06:47.467 --> 06:49.734
I didn't know there'd be
bubbling beakers!

06:49.736 --> 06:52.470
Okay, everyone spread out
and look for clues.

06:54.673 --> 06:57.041
I'm telling you... It's him.
It's definitely him.

06:57.043 --> 06:58.609
I just saw Milt
looking through a microscope

06:58.611 --> 07:01.045
with his left eye,
which means he's left-handed.

07:01.047 --> 07:03.614
David S. Rosenthal is also left-handed!

07:03.616 --> 07:05.016
No. Come on, Brick. Stop messing around.

07:05.018 --> 07:06.184
We got less than an hour.

07:06.186 --> 07:08.152
Let me explain this in a way
you can understand...

07:08.154 --> 07:11.089
Pretend you saw
insert-famous-sports-guy here.

07:11.091 --> 07:12.523
Tell me you wouldn't be all over that.

07:12.525 --> 07:15.760
You got me. Clues.

07:15.762 --> 07:18.362
Come on, Sue!
You're the game master here.

07:18.364 --> 07:19.564
Get in the zone.

07:19.566 --> 07:20.832
We got to beat the Donahues.

07:20.834 --> 07:22.467
If we don't, it's all your fault

07:22.469 --> 07:24.302
and civilization as we know it
is destroyed.

07:24.304 --> 07:25.837
But, hey, no pressure.

07:25.839 --> 07:27.672
Okay, I have tried every side
of the maze,

07:27.674 --> 07:29.307
but the key won't reach the cabinet.

07:29.309 --> 07:31.509
Well, why don't you just move
the cabinet, Einstein?

07:31.511 --> 07:33.044
It's bolted to the floor, Galileo.

07:33.046 --> 07:36.013
Well, then, why don't you just
move the maze, other smart guy?

07:36.015 --> 07:37.915
You can't just move the...

07:42.055 --> 07:43.221
Oh, it's open.

07:43.223 --> 07:45.089
Oh, good job, Sue!

07:45.091 --> 07:46.891
Looks like medical files or something.

07:46.893 --> 07:48.993
Here... Everybody take one
and look for clues.

07:51.096 --> 07:54.765
Okay, uh, it says here
that Dr. I.N. Sane

07:54.767 --> 07:56.367
was fired by the chairman
of the board...

07:56.369 --> 07:57.768
Frank Sinatra.

07:57.770 --> 07:59.737
- What?
- That was my dream. I remember it now.

07:59.739 --> 08:01.839
Me and Frank Sinatra were making out.

08:01.841 --> 08:04.075
Hang on. You were making out
with Frank Sinatra?

08:04.077 --> 08:06.878
Yeah, well, not the old one,
and not the scrawny young one...

08:06.880 --> 08:08.713
the good middle-aged one
with a little meat on his bones.

08:08.715 --> 08:10.333
I told you it was a good dream.

08:11.750 --> 08:14.318
Ooh. Hey, everybody,

08:14.320 --> 08:17.321
I have discovered two things
about this mirror.

08:17.323 --> 08:19.590
One... Whatever the lighting
in this place is,

08:19.592 --> 08:20.858
I look great in it.

08:20.860 --> 08:23.294
And two... pretty sure that's the word

08:23.296 --> 08:25.363
"brain" on the wall over there?

08:25.365 --> 08:28.499
Brains in jars! Clue, people, clue!

08:28.501 --> 08:33.104
Oh, my God. These people in
the zombie room are so pathetic.

08:35.407 --> 08:38.609
So, Milt...

08:38.611 --> 08:42.746
is that short for anything,
like "David"?

08:42.749 --> 08:45.683
Okay, uh, five, seven, six, two!

08:47.720 --> 08:49.253
I'm just gonna say it... At this point,

08:49.255 --> 08:51.255
is the zombie apocalypse
really that bad?

08:51.257 --> 08:52.323
Sue, what's going on?

08:52.325 --> 08:53.891
You're usually all over this stuff.

08:53.893 --> 08:55.560
Yeah, I know.

08:55.562 --> 08:57.195
I am. I usually am.

08:57.197 --> 08:58.829
I-I-I think I just ate something bad.

08:58.831 --> 09:00.331
Maybe some bad couch chips.

09:00.333 --> 09:01.599
Well, we need a plan.

09:01.601 --> 09:03.401
Why doesn't this family
ever have a plan?

09:03.403 --> 09:05.736
We can't just keep trying
everything willy-nilly.

09:05.738 --> 09:07.572
We're going, like, "Ooh, what's this?"

09:07.574 --> 09:08.739
"What's this?"

09:08.741 --> 09:09.740
Wait. What was is this?

09:09.742 --> 09:10.775
Should I ask for a clue?

09:10.777 --> 09:11.909
I think I'm gonna ask for a clue.

09:11.911 --> 09:13.177
Oh, my God!

09:13.179 --> 09:14.579
When I look through
this red lens at the chart,

09:14.581 --> 09:15.613
I see numbers underneath.

09:15.615 --> 09:17.215
Try three, one, eight, four.

09:17.217 --> 09:19.317
W-W-W-Wait... So, if you hold
the magnifying glass

09:19.319 --> 09:20.484
over the chart, something happens?

09:20.486 --> 09:21.519
Yes.

09:21.521 --> 09:22.653
You use the red glass

09:22.655 --> 09:23.988
to decode the numbers.

09:23.990 --> 09:25.523
You have used your first clue.

09:25.525 --> 09:27.091
Sue, we'd already figured it out!

09:27.093 --> 09:29.060
You wasted a clue! I'm sorry.

09:29.062 --> 09:30.828
I didn't realize my finger
was on the button.

09:30.830 --> 09:32.196
Never mind.

09:32.198 --> 09:33.464
We're in.

09:36.268 --> 09:38.269
Another room.

09:39.404 --> 09:40.871
Okay, that one looks complicated.

09:40.873 --> 09:43.207
Sue, you take that.
Everybody else, spread out.

09:48.772 --> 09:49.939
David.

09:50.616 --> 09:52.016
David?

09:52.018 --> 09:55.086
So, uh, what exactly were you
doing with Frank Sinatra?

09:55.088 --> 09:58.055
It was nothing...
just kissing, teenage stuff.

09:58.057 --> 10:01.025
And it wasn't all physical.
There was witty banter.

10:01.027 --> 10:02.593
He said, "I'm gonna take a steam."

10:02.595 --> 10:05.496
And I said, "Now"?
We were funny together.

10:05.498 --> 10:07.465
Yeah. You know he had writers.

10:07.467 --> 10:08.599
They all had writers.

10:08.601 --> 10:10.067
So, did all this stuff happen
in our house?

10:10.069 --> 10:12.903
Ew! No! I would never take
Frank Sinatra to our house.

10:12.905 --> 10:15.339
We were someplace nice.
We were on a bearskin rug.

10:15.341 --> 10:17.441
So, you were a cliché.
I don't need to know any more.

10:17.443 --> 10:18.676
This whole thing is disturbing.

10:18.678 --> 10:20.044
Disturbing?

10:20.046 --> 10:21.679
Okay, I've got three clues!

10:21.681 --> 10:24.115
He has a wife,
he smells like sandalwood...

10:24.117 --> 10:25.983
That was in a
"Parade Magazine" profile...

10:25.985 --> 10:29.186
And M-I-L-T?

10:29.188 --> 10:32.923
Morvan, Ilquan, Lingee, and Tuut?

10:32.925 --> 10:34.692
The four planets of the Kalakwa Galaxy

10:34.694 --> 10:35.660
in the "Planet Nowhere" books.

10:35.662 --> 10:37.028
That can't be a coincidence!

10:37.030 --> 10:38.095
Did you drink some of that

10:38.097 --> 10:39.563
brain juice from the other room?

10:39.565 --> 10:42.133
Hey, I don't care what you guys think.

10:42.135 --> 10:43.968
That is David S. Rosenthal.

10:43.970 --> 10:47.305
I will never forgive myself
if I don't get his autograph.

10:47.307 --> 10:49.740
Full disclosure...
I did not drink the brain juice,

10:49.742 --> 10:51.350
but I did lick the jar.

10:51.352 --> 10:53.444
Brick, where did you get
that pen and paper?

10:53.446 --> 10:54.779
In that cabinet right there.

10:54.781 --> 10:57.281
There's a secret drawer with
keys inside and a book of codes.

10:59.385 --> 11:02.086
Hi. We'd like our third clue.

11:02.088 --> 11:04.121
Hello? Hello?!

11:04.123 --> 11:06.123
We're the Hecks in the zombie room.

11:07.759 --> 11:09.727
I don't get it. Where is Rowdy?

11:09.729 --> 11:11.128
What is the point of even having a Rowdy

11:11.130 --> 11:12.330
if she's not there?

11:12.332 --> 11:14.165
Let's go check the other camera.

11:14.900 --> 11:16.334
Oh, my God, Sue, you're so slow!

11:16.336 --> 11:17.335
Let's get this thing moving.

11:17.337 --> 11:18.369
I already texted Sean

11:18.371 --> 11:19.370
and called them the Down-ahues,

11:19.372 --> 11:21.072
so failure is not an option.

11:21.074 --> 11:23.808
Is it hot in here? I am so hot.

11:23.810 --> 11:25.576
I don't get it. Why are you
choking all of a sudden?

11:25.578 --> 11:26.711
You're totally good at this stuff,

11:26.713 --> 11:27.945
and now you're face-planting big time.

11:27.947 --> 11:29.313
I don't know, okay?

11:29.315 --> 11:31.982
I'm just getting turned around.
I'm all turned around.

11:31.984 --> 11:34.652
Maybe I just need a break.

11:34.766 --> 11:36.199
You want to take a break?

11:36.686 --> 11:37.834
What is wrong with you?

11:37.836 --> 11:41.037
How did I lose every game to you
all these years?

11:41.039 --> 11:42.731
You didn't.

11:43.575 --> 11:44.574
What?

11:44.576 --> 11:46.509
I cheated.

11:46.511 --> 11:48.144
You mean like you cheated sometime?

11:48.146 --> 11:50.441
No, every time, all the time.

11:50.982 --> 11:52.648
"Monopoly"? I made myself banker

11:52.650 --> 11:54.784
and slid myself money under the table.

11:54.786 --> 11:55.985
"Celebrity"?

11:55.987 --> 11:57.687
If I got a name on a card I didn't know,

11:57.689 --> 11:58.855
I would just make one up.

11:58.857 --> 12:00.556
My go-to was always a Disney Princess.

12:00.558 --> 12:02.859
"Mystery Date"? It was
never a mystery to me.

12:02.861 --> 12:04.560
Oh, my God.

12:04.562 --> 12:07.630
Okay, look...
It all started when I was three

12:07.632 --> 12:10.600
and Mom and Dad would play games
with me and let me win.

12:10.602 --> 12:13.936
Winning became my obsession
and my curse.

12:13.938 --> 12:17.874
In the end, it was Miss Sue,
in the family room,

12:17.876 --> 12:19.475
with every game.

12:19.477 --> 12:21.177
Wow.

12:21.179 --> 12:23.312
Wow, wow, wow,

12:23.314 --> 12:25.414
wow, wow, wow.

12:25.416 --> 12:26.949
Who knew Little Miss Perfect

12:26.951 --> 12:28.718
was a dirty, lying cheater?

12:28.720 --> 12:30.219
Shh! Shh!

12:30.221 --> 12:32.255
I can't believe I thought you
were better than me at games.

12:32.257 --> 12:35.258
You know what that did to my
psyche, to my confidence level?

12:35.260 --> 12:37.260
You're the most confident person
in the world.

12:37.262 --> 12:39.195
Yeah, but I could have had more.

12:39.197 --> 12:40.830
Axl, please don't tell Mom and Dad.

12:40.832 --> 12:42.598
This is all I have.

12:42.600 --> 12:44.133
You don't know what it's like to be me.

12:44.135 --> 12:46.469
You were the football star.
Brick is the reader.

12:46.471 --> 12:48.237
I am just the trier.

12:48.239 --> 12:50.907
Do you know how hard it is
year after year

12:50.909 --> 12:52.441
to be the trier?

12:52.443 --> 12:54.644
Fine. I'll keep your secret...

12:54.646 --> 12:56.045
partly because it's so pathetic

12:56.047 --> 12:57.480
and partly because I am really impressed

12:57.482 --> 12:59.048
you were able to cheat at "Marco Polo."

12:59.050 --> 13:01.484
I opened my eyes. Oh, my God.

13:01.486 --> 13:02.585
I didn't even think of that.

13:02.587 --> 13:04.387
Thank you so much
for not saying anything.

13:04.389 --> 13:06.889
I will never forget this.
You're the best, Axl.

13:06.891 --> 13:08.658
At everything, yes,
it's been established now.

13:08.660 --> 13:10.626
But we've wasted too much time
talking about this,

13:10.628 --> 13:12.728
and, as usual, it's up to me
to save my family

13:12.730 --> 13:14.063
from the zombie apocalypse...

13:14.065 --> 13:17.300
starting with this wall,
which is obviously fake.

13:19.000 --> 13:25.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

13:30.247 --> 13:32.716
So, what exactly did you mean
by "disturbing"?

13:32.810 --> 13:35.010
- What?
- You said my dream was disturbing.

13:35.012 --> 13:36.841
That's a pretty strong word.

13:37.214 --> 13:38.947
Well, you're messing around
with another man.

13:38.949 --> 13:40.749
You don't think I should be
disturbed by that?

13:40.751 --> 13:41.617
It's a dream.

13:41.619 --> 13:42.618
Haven't you ever had a dream

13:42.620 --> 13:44.049
about a celebrity before...

13:44.051 --> 13:46.822
Phoebe Cates or Lindsay Wagner
or somebody?

13:46.824 --> 13:48.257
I don't have dreams.

13:48.259 --> 13:49.658
I'm not talking about in life.

13:49.660 --> 13:51.093
I'm talking about when you're asleep.

13:51.095 --> 13:53.262
So am I... I go to sleep, it's dark,

13:53.264 --> 13:55.064
I wake up, put on my shoes, and go.

13:55.066 --> 13:57.800
What? That can't be true.
Everybody dreams.

13:57.802 --> 14:00.769
Not me. Dreaming is just showing
off while you're asleep.

14:00.771 --> 14:03.072
Look, it was nothing.
You know how dreams are.

14:03.074 --> 14:05.841
Well, apparently you don't,
but most people do.

14:05.843 --> 14:08.010
Anyway, it started out
with me in the bathroom

14:08.012 --> 14:09.211
and the gorilla in the next stall

14:09.213 --> 14:10.512
was handing me toilet paper.

14:10.514 --> 14:12.881
And then, all of a sudden,
I'm backstage at The Sands

14:12.883 --> 14:15.284
with Frank and we're having
a shrimp cocktail.

14:15.286 --> 14:16.752
And then the stage manager knocked

14:16.754 --> 14:18.520
and said it was time to go on,
and Frank said,

14:18.522 --> 14:20.189
"Tell Sammy to do five more minutes."

14:20.191 --> 14:22.191
And then he asked me how my day was,

14:22.193 --> 14:23.827
and I told him, and we made out.

14:24.760 --> 14:27.634
Frank Sinatra, the original Danny Ocean,

14:28.032 --> 14:29.665
asked you about your day?

14:29.667 --> 14:32.501
Yeah. Maybe he was interested in me.

14:32.503 --> 14:34.236
That's just dumb.

14:36.873 --> 14:39.842
Oh, I can't believe we're gonna
blow our one chance in life

14:39.844 --> 14:41.510
to beat the Donahues.

14:41.512 --> 14:43.812
They're not the Down-ahues,
they're the Perfect-hues.

14:43.814 --> 14:45.914
They're good at everything,
unlike some people

14:45.916 --> 14:48.650
who just pretend they're good
at stuff when they're not.

14:49.987 --> 14:51.687
Ah! God, it's bright.

14:51.689 --> 14:52.955
Ahh! Geez, come on.

14:55.191 --> 14:57.593
The key! It's got to be for the door!

14:57.595 --> 14:58.760
How are we supposed to get this?

14:58.762 --> 14:59.995
Oh, look. Look at the letters.

14:59.997 --> 15:01.630
I think we got to make words
with the switches.

15:01.632 --> 15:04.066
Okay, Sue, get in there.
It's your time to shine.

15:04.068 --> 15:06.635
Yeah, shine away, you little star, you.

15:08.172 --> 15:11.807
Listen, Milt, I just want you to know

15:11.809 --> 15:14.209
I get it that sometimes
you might need an escape.

15:14.211 --> 15:16.311
You know, I myself am a writer.

15:16.313 --> 15:17.579
So far it's only been a sentence,

15:17.581 --> 15:18.881
but it's been very well received.

15:18.883 --> 15:20.411
Oh, yeah? Well, what is it?

15:21.152 --> 15:23.507
Really? You'd like to hear it?

15:23.888 --> 15:25.619
Wow. Okay.

15:26.123 --> 15:28.490
I always keep it with me
in case I want to noodle on it.

15:30.628 --> 15:34.062
"As his eyes fluttered open,

15:34.064 --> 15:37.599
the boy saw the sun
had already gently nudged awake

15:37.601 --> 15:40.502
its captives,
yesterday's mistakes vanished

15:40.504 --> 15:43.071
to wispy nothings,
and the father he thought

15:43.073 --> 15:45.684
long dead was standing at his door."

15:46.343 --> 15:47.595
Hey, that's great.

15:48.279 --> 15:49.311
Really?!

15:49.313 --> 15:51.113
D-Do you have any notes or advise?

15:51.115 --> 15:52.948
No, no, no. I wouldn't change a word.

15:52.950 --> 15:54.950
Mom, Mom! What do you got?

15:54.952 --> 15:57.386
David S. Rosenthal loves my sentence!

15:57.388 --> 15:59.421
It's inspired me to finish my novel.

15:59.423 --> 16:02.491
Which pose do you like for the
book jacket... this or this?

16:02.493 --> 16:03.926
Not now, Brick. Time's running out.

16:03.928 --> 16:05.314
Sue needs quiet.

16:05.996 --> 16:07.796
Okay, okay... Five-letter word...

16:07.798 --> 16:09.464
Uh..."Chair"! "Chair"!

16:10.367 --> 16:11.767
Uh, "Table"! No, "Zombies"!

16:11.769 --> 16:13.035
That's not even five letters.

16:13.037 --> 16:14.970
Look, what about that list
of patients we found?

16:14.972 --> 16:17.372
Dr. I.N. Sane's first patient was Clara.

16:17.374 --> 16:19.841
Try that. No, there were
100 names on that list.

16:19.843 --> 16:21.643
Just let Sue do this.
She's our best chance.

16:21.645 --> 16:23.045
You got this, Sue. Oh, my God!

16:23.047 --> 16:24.546
I'm telling you, try "Clara."

16:24.548 --> 16:26.048
Axl, shush. I don't want to hear it.

16:26.050 --> 16:27.049
No one's getting out of here

16:27.051 --> 16:28.283
if you don't let me work those levels!

16:28.285 --> 16:29.651
Your family sure does fight a lot.

16:29.653 --> 16:30.786
Oh, "Orson"!

16:30.788 --> 16:32.354
Well, at least when we get
the door open,

16:32.356 --> 16:34.156
you get to leave.

16:34.158 --> 16:35.507
I'm stuck with them.

16:35.509 --> 16:37.092
I'm telling you, she's not gonna get it.

16:37.094 --> 16:38.860
Axl, what is the matter with you?

16:38.862 --> 16:40.329
Why do you always
have to bring her down?

16:40.331 --> 16:41.563
This is the one thing she's good at.

16:41.565 --> 16:42.664
Can't she just have that?

16:42.666 --> 16:44.633
Oh, is she... Is she good at this?

16:44.635 --> 16:46.668
Axl, I'm not gonna
say it again... shut it.

16:46.670 --> 16:48.904
Sue's our best shot at this.
Come on, Sue. Take us home.

16:48.906 --> 16:52.574
Um... Belle! N... Ariel. Pocahontas!

16:52.576 --> 16:54.643
She's just naming Disney Princesses!

16:54.645 --> 16:56.378
That's it! I can't hold it anymore.

16:56.380 --> 16:57.579
It's for the good of the family.

16:57.581 --> 16:59.214
Sue's a big, fat cheater.

16:59.216 --> 17:01.049
That's right. She's cheated
at every game she's ever played.

17:01.051 --> 17:02.551
She palms marbles. She stacks decks.

17:02.553 --> 17:03.552
You ever played "Sorry!" with her?

17:03.554 --> 17:05.454
Well, sorry, you got screwed.

17:05.455 --> 17:07.122
Sue, is that true?

17:08.324 --> 17:10.157
He's right!

17:10.327 --> 17:11.893
I don't know what I'm doing.

17:11.895 --> 17:13.428
We are gonna lose to the Donahues,

17:13.430 --> 17:15.430
and it is all my fault.

17:15.432 --> 17:18.200
I am a cheater.

17:18.202 --> 17:21.036
But that ends today.

17:21.038 --> 17:23.238
I am not gonna let my past define me.

17:23.240 --> 17:27.342
I am moving forward
with confidence, with honor.

17:27.344 --> 17:30.912
Starting now, Sue Heck wins for real!

17:32.583 --> 17:34.316
Time has expired.

17:34.318 --> 17:36.551
The zombie apocalypse has begun.

17:36.553 --> 17:38.387
Mankind is doomed.

17:38.389 --> 17:40.322
Please exit through the fail door.

17:40.324 --> 17:42.557
No!

17:42.559 --> 17:45.594
No! We're not entering 2017
through the fail door.

17:45.596 --> 17:48.063
We have done it every year,
and I am sick of it.

17:48.065 --> 17:50.068
Mom, just admit it... we suck.

17:50.070 --> 17:52.301
No, if anybody sucks, it's Rowdy.

17:52.303 --> 17:53.802
We asked for a clue,
and she didn't get back to us

17:53.804 --> 17:55.670
- for at least two minutes.
- Yeah.

17:55.672 --> 17:57.272
- That's true.
- That's not fair.

17:57.907 --> 17:59.456
Hey, Rowdy,

17:59.458 --> 18:01.009
we want our two minutes.

18:01.011 --> 18:02.577
I'm meeting my cousin for dinner.

18:02.579 --> 18:05.180
Look, I may not care about much,

18:05.182 --> 18:07.749
I barely care about this,
but I know what's right,

18:07.751 --> 18:09.318
and so do you, Rowdy!

18:09.320 --> 18:11.720
You know you owe us two minutes.

18:11.722 --> 18:13.121
Fine.

18:15.025 --> 18:16.625
Okay, let's do this.

18:16.627 --> 18:17.965
Axl, you're up. Yep.

18:18.762 --> 18:22.030
C-L-A-R-A.

18:22.032 --> 18:24.499
Ah-ah-ah-ahh!

18:26.102 --> 18:27.936
Yes, we got it, we got it, we got it.

18:27.938 --> 18:28.937
Whoo.

18:28.939 --> 18:30.572
Suck it, Donahu...

18:30.840 --> 18:32.974
No!

18:32.976 --> 18:35.177
Why does 2017 have it out for us?

18:35.179 --> 18:37.346
Why won't this stupid door open?

18:37.348 --> 18:38.513
Come on, open!

18:38.515 --> 18:40.449
W-W-Wait. You see that?

18:41.150 --> 18:44.686
O-P-E-N.

18:44.688 --> 18:46.588
Oh, my God!

18:46.590 --> 18:49.424
We did it, Hecks... and Milt!

18:49.426 --> 18:51.193
Whoo! And check it out!

18:51.195 --> 18:52.294
We beat the Donahues!

18:54.398 --> 18:56.098
I don't know who these Donahues are,

18:56.100 --> 18:57.599
but we kicked their butts!

18:57.601 --> 19:00.435
- Yeah, we did!
- Okay, everybody, hands in!

19:00.437 --> 19:01.636
What's the book?

19:01.638 --> 19:02.571
"The Catcher in the Rye"!

19:02.573 --> 19:04.206
Okay, one, two, three.

19:04.208 --> 19:06.074
"The Catcher in the Rye"!

19:09.278 --> 19:10.412
Yes!

19:10.414 --> 19:11.713
Give me a high five!

19:11.715 --> 19:13.415
Give me another one!

19:18.640 --> 19:20.308
So, how was your day?

19:20.310 --> 19:21.409
What do you mean, how was my day?

19:21.411 --> 19:23.010
You were there. We beat the Donahues.

19:23.012 --> 19:24.712
It was awesome.
Yeah, well, I don't know.

19:24.714 --> 19:27.014
You're dreaming about guys
asking you about your day,

19:27.016 --> 19:29.083
and I know we've been
pretty busy lately,

19:29.085 --> 19:30.851
and I don't always ask, so I thought,

19:31.747 --> 19:33.154
you know, maybe I should.

19:33.156 --> 19:35.656
Oh. Well, it was good.

19:35.658 --> 19:37.124
Thanks.

19:42.732 --> 19:44.532
Let's see what you dream about tonight.

19:50.105 --> 19:52.039
Well, Milt, it's an honor that someone

19:52.041 --> 19:54.842
of your esteemed profession
likes what I do.

19:54.844 --> 19:57.211
I will carry your approval
with me always.

19:58.280 --> 20:00.514
Okay, then. See you around.

20:12.861 --> 20:14.295
Look around.

20:14.297 --> 20:15.796
No zombies anywhere!

20:15.798 --> 20:17.798
You're welcome, mankind.

20:17.800 --> 20:21.168
Oh, my God. Winning without
cheating feels amazing.

20:21.170 --> 20:22.803
It is so much better.

20:22.805 --> 20:25.172
And I finally have a certificate
for my wall

20:25.174 --> 20:26.707
that doesn't say "Participant."

20:26.709 --> 20:27.842
Yeah!

20:29.245 --> 20:31.612
Everyone has a different kind of escape.

20:31.614 --> 20:33.881
Sometimes we escape into a good book,

20:33.883 --> 20:36.083
sometimes we escape into our dreams.

20:36.085 --> 20:37.952
But one thing you can't escape from

20:37.954 --> 20:40.788
is the Hecks after a rare victory.

20:43.191 --> 20:44.692
Oh, hey, Nancy.

20:44.694 --> 20:46.460
Just got back from the escape room...

20:46.462 --> 20:48.796
Made it out with 1:21 to spare.

20:48.798 --> 20:50.364
What was your time again?

20:50.366 --> 20:52.066
1:08.

20:52.068 --> 20:55.102
Oh, hey, Sean, turns out
when I looked in the mirror,

20:55.104 --> 20:57.405
all I saw was a guy who kicked your ass.

20:57.407 --> 20:58.706
Yeah, I don't know, Ron.

20:58.708 --> 21:00.041
If this mojo keeps up,

21:00.043 --> 21:01.075
I wouldn't get too attached

21:01.077 --> 21:02.343
to that giant spatula.

21:02.345 --> 21:04.578
Yep. Says right here
on the certificate...

21:04.580 --> 21:06.147
The Hecks won.

21:06.149 --> 21:08.849
No apostrophe necessary, Dotty.

21:09.885 --> 21:12.486
Well, that's impressive, you guys.

21:12.488 --> 21:14.722
I guess you're just better
at this than we are.

21:14.724 --> 21:16.891
You know, that's what's great
about you Donahues...

21:16.893 --> 21:18.626
You have fun no matter what.

21:18.628 --> 21:21.095
Happy New Year.
