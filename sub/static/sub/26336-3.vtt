[phone ringing]

09:40.144 --> 09:41.450
Go for Dog.

09:41.493 --> 09:43.234
You better be
in the parking lot.

09:43.278 --> 09:45.933
I'm standing on the first tee,
and it ain't getting any cooler.

09:45.976 --> 09:47.761
Oh, sorry, man.

09:47.804 --> 09:50.241
I just assumed that it was off.

09:50.285 --> 09:52.853
You'd have to be out of
your damn mind to play golf

09:52.896 --> 09:54.550
in weather like this today.

09:54.594 --> 09:57.248
Well, I guess when some of us
say we're going to be somewhere,

09:57.292 --> 09:59.860
our word actually
means something.

09:59.903 --> 10:01.905
Bruddah, why don't you
come join me?

10:01.949 --> 10:04.255
I'm up to my pits in ice.

10:04.299 --> 10:07.302
Beth just made
a fresh batch of lemonade.

10:07.345 --> 10:09.521
Come on, bruddah,
this is a big tub.

10:09.565 --> 10:10.566
I hard pass.

10:10.610 --> 10:12.089
Are you sure?

10:12.133 --> 10:14.744
Listen, you know there's
no shame in tapping out

10:14.788 --> 10:18.095
when Mother Nature's got you
by the short and curlies.

10:18.139 --> 10:20.750
Nobody want to hear about
your short-- good-bye.

10:24.406 --> 10:25.755
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa,
where you going?

10:25.799 --> 10:29.411
Well, your-your buddy
canceled, so I just assumed...

10:29.454 --> 10:31.631
You assumed wrong.

10:31.674 --> 10:34.634
Do you know how hard it is
to get a tee time out here

10:34.677 --> 10:37.375
on a Saturday at this
hoity-toity little club?

10:37.419 --> 10:40.683
I will play the round by myself,
thank you very much.

10:40.727 --> 10:42.554
But, sir, the-the heat.

10:42.598 --> 10:44.382
There's-- Look around,
there's no one else out here.

10:44.426 --> 10:46.646
Well, that's perfect.

10:46.689 --> 10:48.691
Means I can take
my sweet-ass time.

10:48.735 --> 10:52.042
Mr. Grover, I really think
you should reconsider.

10:52.086 --> 10:54.436
Uh, playing in these conditions
just isn't safe.

10:54.479 --> 10:55.698
I'll tell you what ain't safe,

10:55.742 --> 10:57.178
you and all this
yakity-yakity-yakity

10:57.221 --> 10:59.484
while Mr. Grover's trying
to line up his shot.

11:06.709 --> 11:09.320
[monitor beeping steadily]

11:09.364 --> 11:10.800
Mr. Dresden, my name's
Steve McGarrett

11:10.844 --> 11:12.280
with the Five-O
Task Force.

11:12.323 --> 11:14.630
We need to ask you a couple
questions about your tenant,

11:14.674 --> 11:16.023
Tracy Benson.

11:18.155 --> 11:21.593
Mr. Dresden,
can you hear me, sir?

11:21.637 --> 11:24.727
Uh, the doctors had to sedate
him because of the pain.

11:24.771 --> 11:27.643
He's, uh, he's pretty out of it.

11:27.687 --> 11:28.905
Mrs. Dresden?

11:30.559 --> 11:32.735
Can you tell us what happened
to your husband?

11:32.779 --> 11:36.086
Our tenant, Tracy,
went crazy and attacked him.

11:36.130 --> 11:37.697
And I want to press charges.

11:39.611 --> 11:41.091
What?

11:41.135 --> 11:43.311
Is she saying something
different? Well, she's lying.

11:43.354 --> 11:45.313
You want to have a seat?

11:45.356 --> 11:47.054
MRS. DRESDEN:
They had her in handcuffs.

11:47.097 --> 11:48.272
How did she
get away?

11:48.316 --> 11:49.752
STEVE: In order
to get her back,

11:49.796 --> 11:51.536
we're gonna need your help,
Mrs. Dresden.

11:51.580 --> 11:53.756
So can you tell us
what may have caused

11:53.800 --> 11:56.063
Miss Benson to attack
your husband the way she did?

11:56.106 --> 11:57.891
All I know,
I was getting ready for work

11:57.934 --> 11:59.588
and I heard shouting downstairs.

11:59.631 --> 12:00.850
Tracy was upset about

12:00.894 --> 12:02.547
our air conditioning
in her apartment.

12:02.591 --> 12:03.766
I rushed downstairs

12:03.810 --> 12:05.202
to find her standing
over my husband,

12:05.246 --> 12:06.682
punching and kicking him.

12:06.726 --> 12:09.859
And when I screamed for help,
she left.

12:09.903 --> 12:11.687
Okay, wait, I'm sorry,
y-you're saying that-that

12:11.731 --> 12:13.341
she did this to your husband

12:13.384 --> 12:15.430
because of something to do
with her air conditioner?

12:15.473 --> 12:17.475
We've had service people
in and out all week.

12:17.519 --> 12:19.216
Of course
the tenants

12:19.260 --> 12:21.001
blame the super
when their AC breaks down,

12:21.044 --> 12:22.263
but it's not his fault.

12:22.306 --> 12:24.918
The units
are just old.

12:24.961 --> 12:26.658
To me, it still seems
a bit extreme, no?

12:26.702 --> 12:29.183
It's the heat.
It makes people do crazy things.

12:29.226 --> 12:31.098
Have you ever had
problems with, uh,

12:31.141 --> 12:33.187
with Miss Benson
in the past?

12:33.230 --> 12:35.667
Not at all. Uh... Tracy's quiet.

12:35.711 --> 12:38.235
She keeps to herself
and she pays her rent on time.

12:38.279 --> 12:39.715
She's a good tenant.

12:39.759 --> 12:41.238
You know where she works?

12:41.282 --> 12:43.806
I don't think she has a job;
at least she didn't list one

12:43.850 --> 12:44.764
on her rental application.

12:44.807 --> 12:46.591
DANNY: Okay,
so she has no job,

12:46.635 --> 12:48.942
but she pays her rent on time.

12:48.985 --> 12:50.770
She said she was
in a car accident

12:50.813 --> 12:53.207
a couple years ago and there was
an insurance settlement.

12:54.904 --> 12:57.907
I guess it was enough money
where she didn't have to work.

12:59.300 --> 13:01.041
Okay.

13:01.084 --> 13:02.825
So, using the
Social Security Number

13:02.869 --> 13:04.131
you got off
the rental application,

13:04.174 --> 13:07.177
I was able to run
Tracy Benson's finances.

13:07.221 --> 13:09.789
First off, there's no record
of any insurance settlement.

13:09.832 --> 13:12.400
So she lied about how she was
making the rent. What else?

13:12.443 --> 13:14.141
All of her credit cards
and bank accounts

13:14.184 --> 13:17.361
were closed three years ago,
because that's when she died.

13:17.405 --> 13:19.015
What?
Say that again.

13:19.059 --> 13:20.408
Tracy Benson died in 2015.

13:20.451 --> 13:23.715
The death certificate
was issued in New Mexico.

13:23.759 --> 13:25.282
This woman is using
a dead person's identity.

13:25.326 --> 13:27.328
Explains why
she was so desperate

13:27.371 --> 13:28.720
to get away from the cops.

13:28.764 --> 13:30.418
We know that she's
hiding out on the Island,

13:30.461 --> 13:31.854
living under an assumed name,

13:31.898 --> 13:33.900
and whatever it is
she's wanted for is bad enough

13:33.943 --> 13:35.858
she didn't mind adding
"cop killer" to the list.

13:35.902 --> 13:37.294
Thank you, Jerry,
and stay cool today.

13:37.338 --> 13:38.730
It's kind of hot out.Stay hydrated.

13:38.774 --> 13:40.167
Stay hydrated, Jerry.

13:40.210 --> 13:41.646
Oh, you don't
have to worry about me.

13:41.690 --> 13:43.823
I'm working on
a killer smoothie recipe

13:43.866 --> 13:45.868
I got off this nutrition
subreddit I follow.

13:45.912 --> 13:48.653
About to fire up
the ol' Vitamix.

13:48.697 --> 13:50.960
That's good. See? Everyone
takes it seriously, except you.

13:53.876 --> 13:56.313
Aw, crap.What happened?

13:56.357 --> 13:58.838
Uh, nothing, I'm good.Bye, Jerry.

14:07.934 --> 14:10.501
Oh, yeah. There she is.
That's good.

14:12.503 --> 14:13.765
What?

14:13.809 --> 14:16.768
Just getting the optimal
"vent to armpit" angle.

14:16.812 --> 14:18.901
[chuckles] Why don't you
wind the window down

14:18.945 --> 14:20.555
and get a cross-breeze going?

14:20.598 --> 14:22.557
Maybe because it's 105 degrees.

14:22.600 --> 14:23.819
Yeah, see, I
don't mind it.

14:23.863 --> 14:26.039
I-I think, uh, being
hot's a state of mind.

14:26.082 --> 14:28.041
[scoffs]
Says the man with no pants.

14:28.084 --> 14:30.739
See, that's exactly my
point, because we adapt,

14:30.782 --> 14:33.089
you know, if not
physically, then mentally.

14:33.133 --> 14:34.830
See, watch,
I'm gonna wind...
Do not!

14:34.874 --> 14:36.919
Do not even think
about doing that.

14:36.963 --> 14:39.791
And don't get used
to driving my car, either.

14:39.835 --> 14:41.271
Why not?

14:41.315 --> 14:43.839
McGarrett always
drives around Danny's car.[chuckles]

14:43.883 --> 14:46.233
Oh, so you're McGarrett now?I-I didn't say that.

14:46.276 --> 14:48.322
God, it was just a matter
of time, wasn't it?

14:48.365 --> 14:49.758
I mean, you lived together,

14:49.801 --> 14:51.760
went on that SEAL rescue mission
together. Of course.

14:51.803 --> 14:53.849
Hey, there are worse people
to model myself after.You're right.

14:53.893 --> 14:55.242
100%.

14:57.026 --> 14:59.942
Do I still just call you Junior,
or is it McGarrett Junior now?

14:59.986 --> 15:01.248
Okay, then, what?
If I'm McGarrett,

15:01.291 --> 15:02.684
then you're Detective Williams.

15:02.727 --> 15:04.207
[laughs] Okay, no, I am not.

15:04.251 --> 15:05.861
Yeah, see, you just
sounded like him.No, I did not.

15:05.905 --> 15:07.428
Yeah, you sure did.No, I do not.

15:07.471 --> 15:09.299
Come on, say something
he would say.No, get out of here.

15:09.343 --> 15:11.301
Give me your best impression,
come on.

15:11.345 --> 15:13.913
Just drive the car.
Shut up and drive the...Give me your best impression.

15:15.915 --> 15:18.961
[straining]: "You're not--

15:19.005 --> 15:20.963
"Come on, Steve.
Wh-What the hell are you doing?

15:21.007 --> 15:22.878
"Huh? Doors are for knocking,
not kicking down.

15:22.922 --> 15:24.314
"Baboon monkey.

15:25.837 --> 15:28.014
"Jersey's the best. Everything
about Hawaii's terrible.

15:28.057 --> 15:30.930
"Th-The weather, th-the, um,
the-the-the beaches,

15:30.973 --> 15:32.496
"the food. Oh...
[stammers]

15:32.540 --> 15:33.933
"Anyone who puts
pineapple on pizza

15:33.976 --> 15:36.152
should get the death penalty."[laughs]

15:36.196 --> 15:37.980
[phone chimes]That was good.

15:38.024 --> 15:39.416
Okay, look at this.

15:39.460 --> 15:41.505
Alert from HPD.
Liliha area.

15:41.549 --> 15:45.509
Shots fired at 329 Alewa Drive.
Home invasion in progress.

15:45.553 --> 15:46.815
Let's go.Okay, that's us.

15:46.858 --> 15:47.903
[tires screeching]

15:53.691 --> 15:54.997
Hey!

15:55.041 --> 15:57.695
Five-O!
Drop your weapon!

15:57.739 --> 15:59.828
I'm the one who called you guys!

15:59.871 --> 16:01.003
This is my place!

16:01.047 --> 16:02.004
Where's the intruder?

16:02.048 --> 16:03.310
Intruders!

16:03.353 --> 16:05.051
I been holding them off
until you guys arrived.

16:06.052 --> 16:07.270
Let's move.

16:16.062 --> 16:17.498
Thank God you're here.

16:17.541 --> 16:19.152
He's crazy!

16:19.195 --> 16:21.023
We just wanted to cool off,
that's all.

16:21.067 --> 16:22.633
We thought
he was out of town,

16:22.677 --> 16:24.984
but he got back
and he pulled a gun on us.

16:25.027 --> 16:27.377
I just want to go home.

16:27.421 --> 16:28.422
All right. It's okay.

16:28.465 --> 16:29.989
I have to go to the bathroom.

16:30.032 --> 16:32.643
Okay. Come on, get out.

16:34.428 --> 16:35.995
[gunshot]
[screaming]
Hey!

16:36.038 --> 16:37.344
What did I say?!

16:37.387 --> 16:38.519
Put the gun down!

16:38.562 --> 16:40.782
Place it on the roof now!

16:40.825 --> 16:43.654
Not until I see them in cuffs!
All of them!

16:43.698 --> 16:46.048
Put the gun down right now.

16:46.092 --> 16:48.007
They're the ones
who broke into my property.

16:48.050 --> 16:49.617
You won't do
something about it,

16:49.660 --> 16:51.358
I will.I'm not gonna
warn you again.

16:51.401 --> 16:53.882
Okay, buddy?
This guy's out of it.

16:53.925 --> 16:55.623
You think?
Sir?

16:55.666 --> 16:57.755
What's your name?

16:57.799 --> 17:00.454
I'm Junior.

17:01.237 --> 17:02.195
Makaio.

17:02.238 --> 17:05.111
Makaio. Okay.

17:05.154 --> 17:09.071
Hey, Makaio, can you tell me,
are you on any medication?

17:09.115 --> 17:11.856
Cholesterol meds.

17:11.900 --> 17:15.686
And something for my anxiety--
sertraline.

17:15.730 --> 17:17.732
But don't make this about me!

17:17.775 --> 17:19.734
No, I'm not, okay?
Makaio, did you know

17:19.777 --> 17:23.477
that some anxiety medications
can increase heat sensitivity?

17:23.520 --> 17:26.001
Are you messing with me?

17:26.045 --> 17:28.743
Don't mess with me.
I'm warning you.

17:28.786 --> 17:30.353
I'm not. It's true. Okay?

17:30.397 --> 17:32.921
It causes dehydration,
and-and some cases,

17:32.964 --> 17:34.314
heat stroke,
and, buddy,

17:34.357 --> 17:36.011
I-I think that's what's
happening to you right now.

17:36.055 --> 17:38.927
Are you feeling
light-headed?

17:38.970 --> 17:40.929
[stammers] A little bit, but...

17:40.972 --> 17:43.584
All right, then all you need
to do is get out of the sun.

17:43.627 --> 17:44.889
Makaio,
can you do that?

17:44.933 --> 17:48.806
All you need to do
is put down the shotgun

17:48.850 --> 17:50.765
and come inside.

17:50.808 --> 17:52.288
Simple.

18:00.514 --> 18:03.125
[screaming]

18:03.169 --> 18:04.996
[gunshot][people screaming]

18:09.392 --> 18:11.394
[indistinct radio chatter]

18:16.312 --> 18:19.315
That was good work back there.

18:20.708 --> 18:22.666
How did you know
all that stuff?

18:22.710 --> 18:24.494
About the meds?

18:26.540 --> 18:28.063
Uh, my sister.

18:28.107 --> 18:30.413
She was on them for a bit.

18:30.457 --> 18:33.590
And, uh, she got
really disoriented once.

18:33.634 --> 18:37.942
I-In heat. Not nearly
as bad as this, but... yeah.

18:37.986 --> 18:40.684
Got it.

18:40.728 --> 18:43.209
Hey, Junes, I-I know
you don't really talk

18:43.252 --> 18:45.036
about your sister
or what happened,

18:45.080 --> 18:47.387
and that's totally fine.

18:47.430 --> 18:51.042
But just know if-if
you ever wanted to...

18:51.086 --> 18:54.045
Well, thank you. Appreciate it.

18:54.089 --> 18:56.091
You're welcome.

19:01.749 --> 19:03.925
