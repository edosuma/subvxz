00:00.296 --> 00:02.713
(soft music)

00:05.576 --> 00:07.587
(groaning)

00:07.587 --> 00:10.329
(air whooshing)

00:10.329 --> 00:13.309
(explosion booms)

00:13.309 --> 00:15.976
(air whooshing)

00:22.951 --> 00:23.828
(camera shutter snaps)

00:23.828 --> 00:26.828
(people chattering)

00:29.260 --> 00:30.333
- Good afternoon.

00:31.730 --> 00:33.580
I would like to thank each of you

00:33.580 --> 00:36.310
for taking time out of your busy schedules

00:36.310 --> 00:40.630
to be here as I announce my college choice

00:40.630 --> 00:42.780
where I'll be playing
baseball next season.

00:43.810 --> 00:46.010
I know that everyone has been waiting

00:46.010 --> 00:49.820
for me to make this decision
for the past two seasons now,

00:49.820 --> 00:52.800
and I would like to thank
each and every one of you,

00:52.800 --> 00:55.970
including my coaches, my teammates,

00:55.970 --> 00:58.730
my parents, and my friends

00:58.730 --> 01:01.573
for being so patient with
me during this period.

01:02.570 --> 01:06.490
This has been a hard, long,
and thought out decision,

01:06.490 --> 01:09.703
and I hope that for everyone,
it will be worth the wait.

01:10.890 --> 01:15.610
And now it gives me great
pleasure to announce

01:15.610 --> 01:20.110
that I, Ricky Dupree, will
take my superior talents

01:20.110 --> 01:24.360
and attend college right
here in the city of Chicago.

01:24.360 --> 01:27.030
Next year I will be
playing college baseball

01:27.030 --> 01:29.977
for the Chicago University Bandits.

01:32.491 --> 01:33.652
Thank you!

01:33.652 --> 01:36.069
(applauding)

01:51.858 --> 01:54.775
(soft piano music)

02:53.570 --> 02:56.280
- [Nicholas] Take me out to the ball game.

02:56.280 --> 02:57.303
Just take me out.

02:58.670 --> 03:01.120
Take me as far away from
this place as I can get.

03:02.780 --> 03:04.263
My name is Nicholas Dupree.

03:05.560 --> 03:09.733
This is my family, and this is my story.

03:11.120 --> 03:13.070
I live in an upper class black family

03:13.070 --> 03:15.100
in the suburbs of Chicago.

03:15.100 --> 03:16.210
I'm a freshman in high school

03:16.210 --> 03:18.880
and I've always wanted
to live a regular life.

03:18.880 --> 03:21.163
You know, find my own path.

03:22.780 --> 03:24.210
But normal never lived in this house.

03:24.210 --> 03:26.140
You see, my environment at home

03:26.140 --> 03:29.100
was so dysfunctional that I
did not even wanna introduce

03:29.100 --> 03:31.663
one single friend of mine
to anybody in my family.

03:33.030 --> 03:35.373
My father Farris Dupree
is a very proud man,

03:36.370 --> 03:38.935
as well as a very successful businessman.

03:38.935 --> 03:42.570
But he always wanted to be a
major league baseball player.

03:42.570 --> 03:45.210
Now even though he fell
short of his dream,

03:45.210 --> 03:46.960
he made for sure that
all three of his sons

03:46.960 --> 03:50.958
would become all world in the
sport that he loved, baseball.

03:50.958 --> 03:52.720
(knocking on door)

03:52.720 --> 03:54.870
My older brother, Ricky
was well on his way

03:54.870 --> 03:56.470
to being a great player one day.

03:57.590 --> 04:00.500
As for me, I was having a little trouble

04:00.500 --> 04:02.173
getting out of the starting blocks.

04:03.600 --> 04:04.800
- [Farris] Nicholas!

04:04.800 --> 04:06.870
Son, are you hard of hearing?

04:06.870 --> 04:08.610
Did you hear me knocking at the door?

04:08.610 --> 04:11.243
- Of course I heard you,
I'm not deaf, you know.

04:11.243 --> 04:13.020
- [Farris] Well you need to hustle it up.

04:13.020 --> 04:14.203
Time is running out.

04:15.600 --> 04:17.367
- Alright, alright,
I'll be out in a minute.

04:17.367 --> 04:19.690
- [Farris] You'll be ready in a minute?

04:19.690 --> 04:22.400
You get your butt in the
car right now, young man.

04:22.400 --> 04:23.473
It's time to go!

04:24.543 --> 04:27.543
(door shuts loudly)

04:41.090 --> 04:44.510
- Nicholas, when you go out there today,

04:44.510 --> 04:47.460
can you try your best to focus?

04:47.460 --> 04:50.520
Now you know I hate doing
this just as much as you do.

04:50.520 --> 04:52.870
- Look, I know practice
makes perfect and everything

04:52.870 --> 04:55.050
but this is getting ridiculous!

04:55.050 --> 04:56.103
- Boy sit up!

04:57.830 --> 04:59.900
Is that gon' be your excuse
for everything in life?

04:59.900 --> 05:00.733
- No.

05:00.733 --> 05:02.360
- You can't run and
hide from your problems.

05:02.360 --> 05:04.310
- No that's not it mom and you know it.

05:05.170 --> 05:06.250
- I'm listening.

05:06.250 --> 05:09.883
- Look, I love playing baseball.

05:10.770 --> 05:12.910
In fact, I love playing baseball

05:12.910 --> 05:14.880
just as much as the next person.

05:14.880 --> 05:15.990
- Go on.

05:15.990 --> 05:18.010
- But I don't wanna
play for the simple fact

05:18.010 --> 05:19.703
that my father is making me play.

05:23.415 --> 05:25.915
(car honking)

05:27.910 --> 05:29.710
- Hey, I wish you people would come on!

05:29.710 --> 05:30.580
- See?

05:30.580 --> 05:31.957
- Nicholas, that's not
fair and you know it.

05:31.957 --> 05:33.870
I mean what's so wrong with parents

05:33.870 --> 05:36.270
trying to set high standards
for their children?

05:37.810 --> 05:38.760
- Parents you know.

05:41.225 --> 05:42.980
Y'all just don't get it.

05:42.980 --> 05:45.530
The higher the expectations
you place on your kids,

05:46.850 --> 05:48.300
the more they're gonna rebel.

05:51.202 --> 05:53.570
(car honking)

05:53.570 --> 05:54.473
Coming father.

06:01.338 --> 06:04.880
- Alright Nicholas, let's
get ready to play ball.

06:04.880 --> 06:09.140
Now son, I want you to
concentrate on what you're doing.

06:09.140 --> 06:12.210
Now your sole purpose
for being out here today

06:12.210 --> 06:13.420
is to get better.

06:13.420 --> 06:17.240
You're not out here to
have fun or play games son.

06:17.240 --> 06:20.140
This is a serious matter.

06:20.140 --> 06:21.000
Do you hear me?

06:21.000 --> 06:22.850
Nicholas, I'm talking to you.
- Yes, I hear you.

06:22.850 --> 06:25.263
- Alright, don't let me
have to repeat myself.

06:26.130 --> 06:27.393
Alright, let's play ball.

06:33.785 --> 06:36.785
(upbeat drum music)

06:44.718 --> 06:46.108
- Woo!

06:46.108 --> 06:47.972
Come on now, let's play ball!

06:47.972 --> 06:48.805
Woo!

07:07.858 --> 07:09.775
- Come on son, come on.

07:15.682 --> 07:19.800
Watch the ball son, watch the ball.

07:39.378 --> 07:41.682
Nicholas, what are you doing?

07:41.682 --> 07:43.460
What are you doing, Nicholas?

07:43.460 --> 07:45.890
Why can't you just
concentrate on the game?

07:45.890 --> 07:47.103
Where is your mind?

07:48.090 --> 07:48.963
Oh, Nicholas!

08:06.868 --> 08:09.868
(upbeat rock music)

08:58.955 --> 09:01.372
(drum music)

09:06.117 --> 09:07.377
What are you doing?

09:07.377 --> 09:08.390
Just tell me what you're doing!

09:08.390 --> 09:10.690
Now I told you this was a
serious matter, didn't I?

09:10.690 --> 09:13.103
I asked you to concentrate
on what you're doing

09:13.103 --> 09:14.127
and what do you do?

09:14.127 --> 09:15.427
You just go and mess everything?

09:15.427 --> 09:16.466
- You act like it's the World Series.

09:16.466 --> 09:17.752
- Ricky knows what he's doing!

09:17.752 --> 09:19.017
And what's wrong with you?

09:19.017 --> 09:20.427
You out here in the field, right?

09:20.427 --> 09:24.767
I told you to concentrate
in every game that you do.

09:24.767 --> 09:27.350
(gentle music)

09:38.170 --> 09:39.003
Nicholas.

09:41.010 --> 09:41.843
Nicholas, come and sit down son!

09:45.893 --> 09:46.934
Carol, where is that boy?

09:46.959 --> 09:48.840
Nicholas!
- Farris!

09:48.840 --> 09:50.930
Don't start this tonight, please?

09:50.930 --> 09:52.680
Can we have just one decent meal?

09:52.680 --> 09:54.840
Just one!
- Sure baby,

09:54.840 --> 09:58.560
we can have a peaceful meal
together, it's no problem.

09:58.560 --> 10:02.360
I just, all I wanna do is
just have a father and son

10:02.360 --> 10:03.800
chat with the boy, that's all.

10:03.800 --> 10:04.980
Nicholas!

10:04.980 --> 10:06.550
Will you come and sit down?

10:08.521 --> 10:09.354
- What's up, Pop?

10:09.354 --> 10:10.687
What's on your mind?

10:11.763 --> 10:16.063
- There's a lot on my mind, lately.

10:16.980 --> 10:20.053
And I have a pretty good
idea as to what it is.

10:21.880 --> 10:25.803
It's been really bothering
me, really bothering me, son.

10:27.000 --> 10:31.997
So I'm just gonna go ahead
and ask the question myself.

10:33.397 --> 10:35.647
(chuckles)

10:36.980 --> 10:37.883
Who's the girl?

10:39.250 --> 10:41.545
- Who's the girl?
I have no idea...

10:41.645 --> 10:43.558
- You heard me, Nicholas!
- What girl?

10:43.558 --> 10:45.920
- You heard me! Who is the girl?
- Farris.

10:45.977 --> 10:47.810
- I have no idea
what you're talking about.

10:47.810 --> 10:49.060
- Boy, you're in trouble.

10:51.240 --> 10:52.903
- You know who I'm talking about.

10:54.670 --> 10:57.570
You gon' sit there at my table, son,

10:57.570 --> 10:59.900
and play the nut role with me?

10:59.900 --> 11:01.510
Is that what you're going to do?

11:01.510 --> 11:02.343
- No!
- Huh?

11:02.343 --> 11:04.450
You're gonna try to make me think

11:04.450 --> 11:06.643
that I'm the one that's going crazy?

11:08.360 --> 11:10.040
- Baby.
- Baby what?

11:10.040 --> 11:11.360
- What I think he's trying to tell you

11:11.360 --> 11:13.590
is that he's doing the best that he can.

11:13.590 --> 11:14.770
Now at this point, you're just being

11:14.770 --> 11:16.150
a little too hard on him.

11:16.150 --> 11:17.800
- Too hard?
- Yes!

11:17.800 --> 11:20.870
- Please, Carol, please!

11:20.870 --> 11:25.050
I'm not being too hard on
the boy, he's a teenager!

11:25.050 --> 11:27.380
That's what the boy is, all he wants to do

11:27.380 --> 11:30.840
is hang out all night, hang
out and talk with the girls

11:30.840 --> 11:33.190
and then turn around and
hold his own britches.

11:33.190 --> 11:34.390
- At least you give me
credit for something.

11:34.390 --> 11:35.832
- What did you say?
- Nothing.

11:35.832 --> 11:38.343
- Say that again, what
did you mumble over there?

11:40.300 --> 11:41.315
- Did it ever occur to you

11:41.315 --> 11:43.165
that I don't want this as bad as you?

11:44.450 --> 11:46.210
Did you ever think that
maybe it's in the cards

11:46.210 --> 11:47.603
for me to be a regular kid?

11:51.100 --> 11:52.823
- Son, I want you to listen to me.

11:55.256 --> 11:57.423
And I want you to listen to me real good.

11:58.830 --> 12:02.763
There's no such thing as a regular kid.

12:03.820 --> 12:06.410
You are special, son.

12:06.410 --> 12:09.453
You are born special.

12:10.310 --> 12:12.173
And you're going to be special.

12:13.110 --> 12:15.455
- Wow, you know, I wonder
if every other family

12:15.455 --> 12:17.900
on this block has to
sit down and go through

12:17.900 --> 12:19.660
what we go through just
to have a decent meal

12:19.660 --> 12:20.993
one night out of the week.

12:24.030 --> 12:25.990
- Nicholas, you're going straight to bed

12:25.990 --> 12:27.780
without having any dinner tonight.

12:27.780 --> 12:29.960
- Farris!
- Right now, Farris nothing,

12:29.960 --> 12:34.093
you are going to bed tonight
Nicholas without no dinner!

12:35.680 --> 12:36.513
- Bed, but I--

12:36.513 --> 12:40.833
- You may be excused right now.

13:00.430 --> 13:04.640
I don't know why you just
keep on defending that boy.

13:04.640 --> 13:05.473
- Because he's our son

13:05.473 --> 13:07.780
and I think you took it a little too far.

13:07.780 --> 13:09.260
- Too far?

13:09.260 --> 13:11.030
Carol, please!

13:11.030 --> 13:12.040
You're the one that treats him

13:12.040 --> 13:14.504
like a damn baby all the time!

13:14.504 --> 13:16.131
- What the!

13:16.131 --> 13:17.960
(laughs)

13:17.960 --> 13:19.570
- Yeah, all the time!

13:19.570 --> 13:21.320
- I don't know why you're
getting upset with me,

13:21.320 --> 13:23.090
I didn't do anything wrong.

13:23.090 --> 13:28.090
- Because you just make it
too easy for him, Carol!

13:28.740 --> 13:30.360
Just too easy!

13:30.360 --> 13:31.943
If someone just would've,

13:33.200 --> 13:36.580
well, if someone just
would've been hard on me,

13:36.580 --> 13:38.980
then maybe, just maybe I wouldn't have

13:38.980 --> 13:41.850
to wear a shirt and tie everyday.

13:41.850 --> 13:44.933
- Farris, give me a break,
the boy is only 15 years old.

13:46.090 --> 13:48.647
In all seriousness, if you
keep treating him this way,

13:48.647 --> 13:51.410
he can cause all kinds of problems.

13:51.410 --> 13:52.243
But you know what?

13:52.243 --> 13:53.683
By then it's gonna be too late.

13:54.925 --> 13:57.235
(soft piano music)

13:57.235 --> 13:59.818
(Shower water running)

14:06.095 --> 14:07.503
Hey girl, what you doing?

14:10.490 --> 14:12.650
Oh no, nothing's wrong.

14:12.650 --> 14:13.653
No, I'm fine.

14:16.269 --> 14:17.102
I just called to see

14:17.102 --> 14:18.863
how my big sister was doing, that's all.

14:22.613 --> 14:23.850
Hmm mm.

14:23.850 --> 14:26.943
- Nicholas, please and for your sake,

14:28.370 --> 14:31.050
I hope that he does not see
you writing that letter.

14:31.050 --> 14:32.990
- Who said I was writing a letter?

14:32.990 --> 14:34.513
- You just don't get it, do you?

14:34.513 --> 14:36.720
Our father knew exactly when I started

14:36.720 --> 14:38.300
talking to girls my freshman year.

14:38.300 --> 14:41.870
- Well even if I was writing
a letter, what's the big deal?

14:41.870 --> 14:44.730
- Because you changed into
a totally different person.

14:44.730 --> 14:46.980
He knows that something
is going on with you.

14:49.060 --> 14:53.170
- Well, Ricky, I didn't sign on for this.

14:53.170 --> 14:54.003
Any of it!

14:56.009 --> 14:58.170
I'm ready to hand in my uniform.

14:58.170 --> 14:59.520
- I know that you're upset.

15:00.670 --> 15:01.840
And maybe you got a right to be.

15:01.840 --> 15:03.717
- You damn right I'm upset!

15:03.717 --> 15:06.860
If you had to go to bed with
no dinner, you'd be upset too!

15:06.860 --> 15:08.640
- Let me tell you something, Nick.

15:08.640 --> 15:11.030
Leave them girls alone

15:11.030 --> 15:13.280
and start listening to
somebody for a change.

15:20.060 --> 15:21.210
- It's crazy, you know?

15:24.270 --> 15:27.955
Sometimes when I'm trying to have fun,

15:27.955 --> 15:30.298
all I can think about is how many inches

15:30.298 --> 15:31.900
should I be choking up on the bat

15:31.900 --> 15:36.483
or how many balls I
dropped in that out field.

15:40.140 --> 15:42.223
Sometimes I think I'm losing my mind.

15:45.171 --> 15:47.070
- I wanted to be normal too

15:47.070 --> 15:51.350
but if I was normal, I would
not be where I am today.

15:51.350 --> 15:52.250
As simple as that.

15:53.335 --> 15:55.690
(gentle music)

15:55.690 --> 15:57.510
- [Nicholas] The way things
were between my father and me

15:57.510 --> 16:00.173
were putting this huge wedge
between both my parents.

16:01.210 --> 16:04.350
But it seemed that no matter
how bad things would get,

16:04.350 --> 16:05.850
I could always depend on my mother

16:05.850 --> 16:08.127
to come in and make things better for me.

16:10.868 --> 16:13.785
(knocking on door)

16:19.081 --> 16:20.620
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

16:20.620 --> 16:22.037
- You're welcome.

16:26.594 --> 16:27.794
You know what, Nicholas?

16:29.420 --> 16:32.050
Sometimes when things
just aren't right in life,

16:32.050 --> 16:34.623
you have to take a couple
of steps backwards.

16:37.000 --> 16:39.793
And when you take a
couple of steps backwards,

16:42.890 --> 16:44.613
things become so much clearer.

16:46.600 --> 16:50.410
And at that time, all of the
answers that you're looking for

16:50.410 --> 16:52.310
are right there in front of your face.

16:54.635 --> 16:57.863
And then you can move forward, finally.

17:00.040 --> 17:01.780
And that's what we're
gonna have to do, Nicholas,

17:01.780 --> 17:04.390
is we're gonna have to move forward, okay?

17:06.474 --> 17:09.392

- I was exactly where I was
supposed to be, Maxine, home!

18:51.855 --> 18:54.700
- You were supposed to
be answering my call.

18:54.700 --> 18:57.590
I dialed your number at
least nine or 10 times.

18:57.590 --> 18:59.480

19:00.505 --> 19:01.338
- And?

19:01.338 --> 19:02.290
The line was busy.

19:02.290 --> 19:04.033
It was busy the whole time.

19:06.050 --> 19:08.255
- Maxine, look, you're my girl alright?

19:08.255 --> 19:10.031
And you know I respect that.

19:10.031 --> 19:12.123
- Why is it always a mystery with you?

19:13.620 --> 19:16.570
- I already told you, our
communication has to be discrete.

19:17.420 --> 19:19.670
- And that's supposed
to make me feel better?

19:24.820 --> 19:25.653
Look.

19:27.400 --> 19:31.870
I'm a beautiful person
that has a lot to offer.

19:31.870 --> 19:35.260
And if you can't show me any attention,

19:35.260 --> 19:36.810
then I'll just have to move on.

19:37.718 --> 19:39.210
- To tell you the truth Maxine,

19:39.210 --> 19:40.157
I don't want our relationship

19:40.157 --> 19:42.257
adding to the problems I'm already having.

19:44.650 --> 19:47.533
Look, I know I should've told you, okay?

19:48.570 --> 19:49.950
But I just didn't.

19:49.950 --> 19:51.423
- What is the big secret?

19:53.719 --> 19:57.140
(school bell rings)

19:57.140 --> 19:58.690
- You see that dude over there?

19:59.630 --> 20:00.583
The guy in the middle.

20:02.220 --> 20:06.193
Well, that's my brother Ricky.

20:08.170 --> 20:13.170
- You mean to tell me that
Ricky Dupree is your brother?

20:13.340 --> 20:15.760
The Ricky Dupree that's
going to hold the workout

20:15.760 --> 20:16.850
and the press conference

20:16.850 --> 20:19.300
for all the media people later today?

20:19.300 --> 20:21.870
Why is it you never cared
to mention him to me before?

20:21.870 --> 20:24.269
- Because it don't matter, should it?

20:24.269 --> 20:26.840
- Oh wow.
- Hi Ricky,

20:26.840 --> 20:28.760
nice if you would drop in.

20:28.760 --> 20:29.790
Hey, this is Maxine.

20:29.790 --> 20:31.220
Maxine, Ricky.

20:31.220 --> 20:33.083
- It is so good to finally meet you.

20:34.153 --> 20:35.203
- Always my pleasure.

20:37.690 --> 20:41.610
- Nick has told me so many
wonderful things about you.

20:41.610 --> 20:46.530
- Is that right?

20:46.530 --> 20:48.313
- Okay, time to go to class Maxine.

20:49.876 --> 20:51.880
I'll see you around Ricky.

20:51.880 --> 20:53.773
Come on, let's go to
class before you're late.

20:56.913 --> 20:59.580
(phone ringing)

21:04.300 --> 21:05.800
- Farris Dupree.

21:05.800 --> 21:07.763
- Hey baby, it's me Carol.

21:07.763 --> 21:09.513
- Oh hey, baby, how are you?

21:10.570 --> 21:11.403
Good.

21:12.380 --> 21:13.700
So how are things at home?

21:13.700 --> 21:15.930
- Well actually everything
is right on schedule.

21:15.930 --> 21:17.640
- [Sasha] Farris, I need those papers.

21:17.640 --> 21:18.880
- [Carol] I just got through making dinner

21:18.880 --> 21:21.350
and actually I'm getting ready
to start on dessert and--

21:21.350 --> 21:22.620
- Sweetheart, did you remember

21:22.620 --> 21:25.390
to bake the food with no salt?

21:25.390 --> 21:27.620
- Well as soon as I clean
up, everything will be set.

21:27.620 --> 21:29.533
- Well that's just perfect.

21:29.533 --> 21:32.243
So I'll talk to you later then.

21:34.330 --> 21:39.280
And listen, try to forget
about yesterday, okay?

21:39.280 --> 21:40.593
I mean, really try.

21:41.810 --> 21:42.760
Alright then, baby.

21:43.740 --> 21:44.573
Bye bye.

21:48.560 --> 21:50.010
- [Sasha] Is everything okay?

21:51.746 --> 21:55.470
- (sighs) We had a disagreement yesterday

21:55.470 --> 21:58.440
but it's been really wearing on me

21:58.440 --> 22:00.700
but it's really no big deal.

22:00.700 --> 22:04.009
- Well, is there anything that I can do?

22:04.009 --> 22:06.759
(soft R&B music)

22:10.723 --> 22:13.556
(door bell rings)

22:15.920 --> 22:17.010
- Surprise!

22:17.010 --> 22:18.240
Remember me?
- Hey.

22:19.680 --> 22:21.650
- Come here, you act like
you're not glad to see me.

22:21.650 --> 22:23.370
In my arms, come here.

22:23.370 --> 22:25.320
- Oh girl, I'm always glad to see you

22:25.320 --> 22:26.680
but what are you doing here?

22:26.680 --> 22:28.860
- Well, the way your
voice sounded last night,

22:28.860 --> 22:31.278
I felt like my baby sister needed me.

22:31.278 --> 22:32.890
- Dee Dee where are the boys?

22:32.890 --> 22:34.050
- They're out in the car.

22:34.050 --> 22:36.057
Y'all get out of the
car and come on in here!

22:36.057 --> 22:38.663
And leave the junk in the car out there!

22:44.440 --> 22:47.590
- Oh Dee Dee, I feel like
I've totally lost myself.

22:47.590 --> 22:49.160
- Don't pay Farris any attention.

22:49.160 --> 22:51.610
He told you to forget about it, didn't he?

22:51.610 --> 22:52.690
- Yeah, he did but I--

22:52.690 --> 22:53.950
- Okay then.

22:53.950 --> 22:55.450
You have done a wonderful job

22:55.450 --> 22:58.440
raising three beautiful
children, boys at that.

22:58.440 --> 23:00.750
You cannot let him take your confidence.

23:00.750 --> 23:02.060
- Girl that's easy for you to say.

23:02.060 --> 23:05.200
You're not the one who has
to sleep with one eye open.

23:05.200 --> 23:07.570
- When men are unhappy with their lives,

23:07.570 --> 23:09.600
they try to make the woman feel bad

23:09.600 --> 23:12.143
just to make themselves feel better.

23:12.143 --> 23:14.726
(upbeat music)

23:16.942 --> 23:19.420
- [Man] I'm Kevin
Weinstein with this week's

23:19.420 --> 23:21.010
Chicago Sports Minute.

23:21.068 --> 23:23.843
From DuPage Prep high school
to a future college mound,

23:23.843 --> 23:26.178
Chicago baseball star, Ricky Dupree

23:26.178 --> 23:28.090
has had an astonishing rise.

23:28.090 --> 23:29.050
- [Man] At the end of the season,

23:29.050 --> 23:31.130
the associated press named six foot four,

23:31.130 --> 23:35.270
190-pound Ricky Dupree AP
National Player of the year.

23:35.270 --> 23:37.470
- [Woman] Ricky Dupree
led his team in home runs,

23:37.470 --> 23:40.640
hits and was second on the team in steals.

23:40.640 --> 23:42.600
- [Man] Ricky has a major press conference

23:42.600 --> 23:45.290
set for this afternoon but after receiving

23:45.290 --> 23:47.230
all the national media's attention,

23:47.230 --> 23:48.790
the big question remains,

23:48.790 --> 23:53.053
which college will this baseball
star attend next season?

23:55.110 --> 23:57.020
- Girl, I get so sick and tired of hearing

23:57.020 --> 23:59.323
that man talk about how
perfect his mama is.

23:59.323 --> 24:00.156
- Wait a minute.

24:00.156 --> 24:01.730
I thought Farris' mother was dead.

24:01.730 --> 24:02.860
- [Carol] She is dead.

24:02.860 --> 24:05.060
- And besides, what does she
have to do with any of this?

24:05.060 --> 24:07.870
- Nothing, she died
like over 15 years ago.

24:07.870 --> 24:09.490
- Okay, so what does she have to do

24:09.490 --> 24:10.640
with the price of Tea in China?

24:10.640 --> 24:11.473
- I don't know, I just feel like

24:11.473 --> 24:13.560
he's always kinda comparing her to me.

24:13.560 --> 24:16.010
- Well, have you ever tried to ask him

24:16.010 --> 24:17.640
to please stop doing it?

24:17.640 --> 24:20.750
- Time and time again but you know what?

24:20.750 --> 24:23.270
Whenever I don't answer his every demand,

24:23.270 --> 24:26.304

Ricky decides he gon' stay here

24:38.128 --> 24:40.960

24:40.960 --> 24:44.240

24:44.240 --> 24:46.140
- Why decide to stay here to go to school?

24:46.140 --> 24:47.790

27:04.520 --> 27:06.610

- Shut up.

27:39.030 --> 27:40.280

27:41.810 --> 27:43.717
- I thought she was with you.

27:44.570 --> 27:45.920
- I don't think she came outside,

27:45.920 --> 27:48.470
she must be in there
talking, I don't know.

27:53.009 --> 27:54.509
- Get off my face.

27:59.440 --> 28:02.350
- Whatever the case is,
it didn't start just now.

28:02.350 --> 28:04.173
It started a long time ago.

28:07.360 --> 28:09.320
- You know what Dee Dee,

28:11.680 --> 28:13.853
all he does is say that I'm crazy.

28:16.750 --> 28:19.043
- You gotta follow your gut instinct.

28:21.260 --> 28:24.250
Relationships, they're
either gonna get better

29:00.340 --> 29:03.733
Things will not continue this way.

29:04.620 --> 29:07.810
- Carol, you are a beautiful woman.

29:07.810 --> 29:10.960
You have a beautiful home
and beautiful children.

29:10.960 --> 29:14.560
People will give their left
arm to trade places with you.

29:14.560 --> 29:16.060
- I know.

29:16.060 --> 29:18.980
- You may not know it, but
you have the perfect life.

29:25.185 --> 29:28.185
(suspenseful music)

29:54.998 --> 29:57.915
(soft piano music)

30:18.675 --> 30:21.092
(door shuts)

30:23.000 --> 30:24.448
- I can't believe that you would bring

30:24.448 --> 30:27.280
another woman in this house.

30:27.280 --> 30:28.870
I can't believe that you would actually

30:28.870 --> 30:31.310
do this to me or our family.

30:31.310 --> 30:32.950
- Carol, damn!

30:32.950 --> 30:34.560
You are overreacting!

30:34.560 --> 30:36.530
- Overreacting--
- Yes, overreacting,

30:36.530 --> 30:38.170
let's be reasonable!

30:38.170 --> 30:41.380
You are always overreacting,
every time I look around!

30:41.380 --> 30:44.400
- How in the hell do you
explain what you were doing

30:44.400 --> 30:48.070
in that bathroom in our
house with that woman?

30:48.070 --> 30:49.660
- What woman, Carol?

30:49.660 --> 30:50.570
- Sasha.

30:50.570 --> 30:52.760
- But I'm telling you,
girls are distractions

30:52.760 --> 30:55.210
for your career and your future.

30:55.210 --> 30:57.100
Girls are no good for you.

30:57.100 --> 30:58.900
- You know who in the
hell I'm talking about

30:58.900 --> 31:01.180
so don't you dare play games with me!

31:01.180 --> 31:04.880
- You are always over throwing
things out of proportion.

31:04.880 --> 31:06.460
- I did it to protect you.

31:06.460 --> 31:07.940
- Protect me?

31:07.940 --> 31:09.770
You call protecting me
going to the bathroom

31:09.770 --> 31:11.150
with my girlfriend?

31:11.150 --> 31:12.830
- Farris--
- Farris what?

31:12.830 --> 31:16.041
- You get your finger out
of my face, Farris Dupree.

31:16.041 --> 31:17.970
It is over.

31:17.970 --> 31:19.550
- You know what, I never
thought in a million years

31:19.550 --> 31:21.747
my own brother would be
the one to do this to me.

31:21.747 --> 31:24.873
- Carol, come back here.

31:26.800 --> 31:29.870
Carol, where you taking Marcus?

31:29.870 --> 31:30.703
Carol!

31:30.703 --> 31:31.710
- Truth of the matter is you know what?

31:31.710 --> 31:32.653
I liked that girl.

31:33.890 --> 31:35.320
I did.

31:35.320 --> 31:37.623
But it's never been about
what I like though, right?

31:39.078 --> 31:41.828
(soft sad music)

31:43.892 --> 31:46.642
(birds chirping)

31:49.860 --> 31:51.350
- Nicholas wake up!

31:51.350 --> 31:52.963
The school is calling again.

31:54.890 --> 31:56.300
Nicholas, I said wake up!

31:56.300 --> 31:57.540
They ain't playing with you!

31:57.540 --> 31:59.373
- I'm up, I'm up, I'm up.

32:00.680 --> 32:01.683
I hate that school.

32:02.790 --> 32:03.623
They're always yelling at me.

32:03.623 --> 32:05.092
They're so mean to me up there,

32:05.092 --> 32:05.925
I don't wanna go back over there.

32:05.925 --> 32:08.930
- I'ma say this to you once
and I do mean one time only.

32:08.930 --> 32:12.650
The next time that school
calls my house, it's over.

32:12.650 --> 32:17.080
Army, Navy, Job Corps, you
getting your ass up out of here!

32:17.080 --> 32:19.220
Now get up!

32:19.220 --> 32:20.053
Now!

32:20.053 --> 32:22.502
Get up!
- I'm up, I'm up.

32:22.502 --> 32:24.919
(soft music)

32:32.311 --> 32:36.311
(transitions into upbeat music)

33:24.111 --> 33:27.111
(people chattering)

33:35.711 --> 33:36.711
- Thank you.

33:38.250 --> 33:40.963
- Is that Carol, Carol Fields?

33:43.820 --> 33:45.620
- That was my name years ago.

33:45.620 --> 33:48.163
- It's me, Mr. Johnson
from the project buildings.

33:50.060 --> 33:52.810
- Mr. Johnson, how have you been?

33:52.810 --> 33:55.803
- I've been great but how about yourself?

33:57.000 --> 33:58.300
- Not doing so well.

34:03.175 --> 34:05.990
- Now Carol, you know I'll
do anything in the world

34:05.990 --> 34:08.270
to help out a family friend.

34:08.270 --> 34:09.219
What's the problem?

34:12.600 --> 34:15.572
- Mr. Johnson is my soon
to be 18 year old son.

34:18.560 --> 34:20.940
I just don't know what to do anymore.

34:20.940 --> 34:23.053
- Well, tell me about it, I got all day.

34:24.965 --> 34:28.139
(upbeat funky music)

34:28.139 --> 34:30.090
- I don't know what's going on anymore.

34:32.851 --> 34:34.672
My life wasn't supposed to be like this.

34:41.650 --> 34:43.139
You'd think, right?

34:43.139 --> 34:46.060
You know, after leaving that
life I left in the suburbs,

34:46.060 --> 34:48.003
you'd think everything would be all good.

34:50.061 --> 34:51.297
But you know what?

34:51.297 --> 34:52.130
It's not.

34:53.371 --> 34:54.422
My mama is mad at me.

34:55.260 --> 34:56.860
I'm flunking every class I'm in.

34:57.798 --> 34:59.110
One thing is for sure though,

34:59.110 --> 35:00.897
I cannot get kicked out of school.

35:12.415 --> 35:15.190
- Man how in the hell you gone
try out for the baseball team

35:15.190 --> 35:16.850
and today is your last day of school.

35:16.850 --> 35:18.660
- Yeah and usually when you get suspended,

35:18.660 --> 35:19.927
they come looking for you in the morning

35:19.927 --> 35:21.790
and what, it's already lunch now.

35:21.790 --> 35:24.208
- He right, I've been
suspended twice this year

35:24.208 --> 35:26.851
and the ain't never waited
this late to come get me.

35:29.465 --> 35:30.560
- I figure since I've missed so many days

35:30.560 --> 35:31.430
maybe they just you know,

35:31.430 --> 35:32.737
let me slide on this one, you know?

35:32.737 --> 35:34.280
- (laughs) Slide?

35:34.280 --> 35:35.113
Man, we're talking about

35:35.113 --> 35:37.330
the jackass principle Jack Wheeler here.

35:37.330 --> 35:38.523
He ain't letting nothing slide.

35:38.523 --> 35:40.790
Man, he even suspended
his own nephew one day

35:40.790 --> 35:42.390
for breaking the cafeteria line.

35:43.384 --> 35:44.217
- [Nicholas] But you know what?

35:44.217 --> 35:48.023
Slide or no slide, if I get
caught up again, I'm done.

35:50.710 --> 35:52.850
- Okay guys, pay attention to me now.

35:52.850 --> 35:54.100
As you can see the cheerleaders

35:54.100 --> 35:55.795
are sponsoring a canned food drive

35:55.795 --> 36:00.240
and we expect each and every
one of you to participate.

36:00.240 --> 36:02.170
We're gonna be taking
cans and stacking them

36:02.170 --> 36:03.383
in the front hallway.

36:04.420 --> 36:05.770
Anybody have any questions?

36:14.350 --> 36:15.183
Alright.

36:18.710 --> 36:21.377
(phone ringing)

36:23.850 --> 36:24.683
- Hello?

36:26.260 --> 36:27.890
Speaking.

36:27.890 --> 36:30.100
- Here come Mr. Wheeler, now man!

36:30.100 --> 36:31.693
- What?
- Mr. Wheeler!

36:33.910 --> 36:35.500
- Nicholas Dupree, I need to see you

36:35.500 --> 36:38.400
in my office right away, please.

36:38.400 --> 36:40.600
- You mean, right now
at this exact moment?

36:40.600 --> 36:44.423
- Right now, get all
your things and let's go.

36:44.423 --> 36:45.360
- Can I finish eating first?
- No!

36:45.360 --> 36:46.193
Let's go!

36:47.987 --> 36:50.987
(people chattering)

37:03.300 --> 37:06.280
- [Carol] Principal Wheeler,
I understand that Nicholas

37:06.280 --> 37:08.670
has been in quite a lot of trouble lately

37:08.670 --> 37:12.240
but kicking him out of the
school isn't the right answer.

37:12.240 --> 37:14.750
I just don't believe that
you're giving him a fair chance.

37:14.750 --> 37:15.713
- Giving him?

37:17.480 --> 37:19.250
Giving him?

37:19.250 --> 37:21.910
You're making it seem like it's my fault.

37:21.910 --> 37:23.120
It's obvious we are dealing

37:23.120 --> 37:25.163
with a kid without a purpose here.

37:26.184 --> 37:30.090
- Alright, I'll help him with
his homework after school,

37:30.090 --> 37:32.050
I'll make sure that he
gets a job after school

37:32.050 --> 37:34.860
but it just, it can't end
like this Mr. Wheeler.

37:34.860 --> 37:37.540
- The school system has rules.

37:37.540 --> 37:40.100
And those rules must be followed.

37:40.100 --> 37:41.530
- But you are the principal.

37:41.530 --> 37:43.934
What I'm saying is that you
have the power to change this.

37:43.934 --> 37:45.610
- I know this.

37:45.610 --> 37:48.650
But the kid has a long rap sheet.

37:48.650 --> 37:51.050
And the rules state that he has to go.

37:51.050 --> 37:52.400
- Well, what's he gonna do now?

37:52.400 --> 37:55.160
- Well, I don't know, I can't answer that.

37:55.160 --> 37:57.720
- Principal Wheeler, my son
is a senior in high school

37:57.720 --> 37:59.770
and he's soon to be 18 years old.

37:59.770 --> 38:00.790
I mean, if you kick him out now,

38:00.790 --> 38:02.887
he'll be trash in six months.

38:02.887 --> 38:05.160
Nicholas could start selling drugs,

38:05.160 --> 38:07.187
hell, he could even start using drugs.

38:07.187 --> 38:12.180
- I'm looking at if I can
count them, 45 absences?

38:12.180 --> 38:17.180
35 tardies, he comes to school
but he doesn't go to class.

38:18.410 --> 38:19.293
It's too late.

38:20.390 --> 38:22.640
I don't know why parents
wait 'til the last minute

38:22.640 --> 38:24.533
to care about their kid's education.

38:26.110 --> 38:28.063
I'm sorry, he has to go.

38:28.063 --> 38:31.360
(knocking on door)

38:31.360 --> 38:33.280
- Can I talk to you for a minute, boss?

38:33.280 --> 38:34.633
- Yeah Bennie, come on in.

38:38.100 --> 38:39.570
- This is the young man that I saw

38:39.570 --> 38:41.060
on the baseball field this morning.

38:41.060 --> 38:43.840
You know, the one throwing the fastballs.

38:43.840 --> 38:46.000
- [Wheeler] This is the
guy you saw pitching?

38:46.000 --> 38:47.678
- He's the one.

38:47.678 --> 38:50.020
- But this guy is on his
way out of this school.

38:50.020 --> 38:51.470
- I understand that.

38:51.470 --> 38:53.050
But with all due respect, sir.

38:53.050 --> 38:54.990
As community leaders,
it's our responsibility

38:54.990 --> 38:56.610
to help these kids out
when they need it the most,

38:56.610 --> 38:57.490
not throw them out.

38:57.490 --> 38:59.790
- Yeah but I don't know
about this guy, coach.

39:01.500 --> 39:03.010
- You did say you wanted

39:03.010 --> 39:04.570
a winning baseball team this year, right?

39:04.570 --> 39:06.150
- Yeah but--
- Well this is the young man

39:06.150 --> 39:07.650
that can help us do just that.

39:12.505 --> 39:14.313
- Okay, Mrs. Dupree.

39:15.340 --> 39:17.060
This is what we're going to do.

39:17.060 --> 39:19.543
We'll suspend him for three days.

39:20.500 --> 39:24.730
Upon his return, if he misses one day,

39:24.730 --> 39:28.423
if he's tardy one time, he's out of here.

39:29.260 --> 39:33.770
And he must bring his
grades up to a C average

39:33.770 --> 39:36.030
and join some after school activity.

39:36.030 --> 39:37.303
Also get a job.

39:40.610 --> 39:44.300
If he fails to do any one of those things,

39:44.300 --> 39:46.860
one of 'em, he's out of here faster

39:46.860 --> 39:48.750
than you can say Jack Flash.

39:48.750 --> 39:50.300
- Fair enough, principal Wheeler.

39:50.300 --> 39:51.573
Thank you so much.

39:55.812 --> 39:57.228
- Thank you.

39:57.228 --> 39:59.811
(upbeat music)

40:01.118 --> 40:02.702
- What took you so damn long?

40:02.702 --> 40:05.003
- Had to make sure the
coast was clear, man.

40:05.867 --> 40:07.822
- Nick, I think this is a bad idea, man.

40:07.830 --> 40:09.820
Maybe we should just put it back.

40:09.820 --> 40:11.900
- Man, would you please shut the hell up

40:11.900 --> 40:13.700
and watch the damn tape?

40:13.700 --> 40:15.990
You're making more damn
noise than the woman is.

40:15.990 --> 40:18.060
- He's right, Nate, relax.

40:18.060 --> 40:19.750
Take some risk for once.

40:19.750 --> 40:20.703
- If auntie Carol caught us watching this,

40:20.703 --> 40:22.800
we'd be in a whole lot of trouble, man.

40:22.800 --> 40:23.633
- So what, dude?

40:23.633 --> 40:25.150
I'm already in trouble.

40:25.150 --> 40:26.800
So I might as well just have my fun now.

40:26.800 --> 40:29.500
Look, if she says anything,
look, I'll take the blame.

40:41.020 --> 40:43.373
- Well they are rare but they exist.

40:45.230 --> 40:48.073
- Man, you see the
breasteses on that woman?

40:49.448 --> 40:51.640
- Man, I still think this is a bad idea.

40:51.640 --> 40:54.010
I just got a funny feeling about this.

40:54.010 --> 40:55.860
- Nick, would you please kick

40:55.860 --> 40:57.610
his lame ass out and lock the door?

40:57.610 --> 40:59.020
- Shut up!
- Nate,

40:59.020 --> 41:00.520
one more outburst out of you

41:00.520 --> 41:03.513
and I will strangle you
with the extension chord.

41:04.983 --> 41:05.870
- [Carol] Dee Dee, come on,

41:05.870 --> 41:08.320
you always have the most
interesting day stories.

41:09.506 --> 41:11.673
(moaning)

41:23.830 --> 41:26.560
Girl, I wish this apartment
building had a elevator,

41:26.560 --> 41:28.713
everyday this is the walk I have to make.

41:29.556 --> 41:30.389
- [Dee Dee] You know
you gotta take one step

41:30.389 --> 41:32.053
to get to the other side.

41:47.006 --> 41:49.930
- (laughs) Girl I cannot
wait to get in here

41:49.930 --> 41:51.250
and kick off these shoes

41:51.250 --> 41:53.340
and sit on the couch and relax my feet.

41:53.340 --> 41:56.247
- It's not as, Amen.
- It's been a long hot day.

41:56.247 --> 41:57.647
- [Dee Dee] And I got a son.

41:58.637 --> 41:59.618
(screaming)

41:59.618 --> 42:01.448
- What, Dee Dee!

42:01.448 --> 42:02.306
Dee Dee!

42:02.306 --> 42:03.139
Oh, hell no!

42:03.139 --> 42:03.972
What is that?

42:03.972 --> 42:07.055
(upbeat funky music)

42:41.281 --> 42:45.031
- I hope we're not busy
the whole day today.

42:54.150 --> 42:56.610
My mother said you used
to own an old corner store

42:56.610 --> 42:57.443
in her neighborhood, that's--

42:57.443 --> 42:59.550
- Would you please let
me finish this report

42:59.550 --> 43:01.740
before my manager comes back?

43:01.740 --> 43:04.603
Please sit there and shut up!

43:10.640 --> 43:14.050
- You know what, since
you're a little busy,

43:14.050 --> 43:15.170
I'ma go wait in front until you--

43:15.170 --> 43:16.883
- Oh no, hell you won't!

43:18.240 --> 43:20.310
It's bad enough you came
in here 30 minutes late,

43:20.310 --> 43:22.223
now you messing up my concentration.

43:24.331 --> 43:26.303
Let me ask you something.

43:27.170 --> 43:28.583
Why do you wanna work here?

43:29.957 --> 43:31.160
(clears throat)

43:31.160 --> 43:33.290
- I think it'd be a
good opportunity for me

43:33.290 --> 43:37.928
to get some work experience
and learn some responsibility

43:37.928 --> 43:39.900
and make a little money in the process.

43:39.900 --> 43:41.180
- Oh right, right, right.

43:41.180 --> 43:42.810
Let me ask you again.

43:42.810 --> 43:44.733
Why do you wanna work here?

43:49.300 --> 43:51.150
- To tell you the truth, Mr. Johnson,

43:52.030 --> 43:53.580
I really don't wanna work here.

43:54.894 --> 43:56.623
But I made some promises.

43:57.810 --> 44:00.710
And if I can make a little
money in the process, so be it.

44:02.300 --> 44:04.000
- Let me share something with you.

44:05.013 --> 44:06.743
You're trying to con a con.

44:07.800 --> 44:09.890
You're trying to con
somebody that's already been

44:09.890 --> 44:11.190
where you're trying to go.

44:13.050 --> 44:14.943
- Okay, alright.

44:16.320 --> 44:17.780
So now that we've got that out of the way,

44:17.780 --> 44:19.420
where do we go from here?

44:19.420 --> 44:21.803
- You can start by leaving my restaurant.

44:23.350 --> 44:24.290
- Leave?

44:24.290 --> 44:25.123
Why do you want me to leave?

44:25.123 --> 44:26.610
- Because you're not here to work.

44:26.610 --> 44:28.280
Get the hell out of my shop!

44:28.280 --> 44:31.317
And go back to where they'll
be glad to see your ass.

44:31.317 --> 44:33.280
- What am I supposed to tell my mother?

44:33.280 --> 44:34.633
I can't tell her I got
fired on the first day.

44:34.633 --> 44:37.240
- I don't know, tell her the truth.

44:37.240 --> 44:38.363
Tell her you quit.

44:50.828 --> 44:51.958
(upbeat music)

44:51.958 --> 44:55.650
- [Carol] Oh girl, I am
so glad that I do not have

44:55.650 --> 44:57.890
to go back to that place again.

44:57.890 --> 45:00.780
- [Dee Dee] Time will tell everything.

45:00.780 --> 45:03.730
- I just feel like Nicholas
needs a strong role model

45:03.730 --> 45:06.023
in his life, like a good
male figure you know?

45:06.023 --> 45:08.133
I think Mr. Johnson will be good for that.

45:10.150 --> 45:13.840
- Listen, speaking of male figures.

45:13.840 --> 45:15.740
When are you gonna start dating again?

45:16.680 --> 45:17.577
- Dating?

45:17.577 --> 45:19.677
Dee Dee, where in hell did that come from?

45:21.410 --> 45:23.580
- I don't know, I just
get tired of seeing you

45:23.580 --> 45:25.980
sitting in that apartment
every single night.

45:25.980 --> 45:26.880
I just thought you would like

45:26.880 --> 45:29.370
some male companionship for a change.

45:29.370 --> 45:31.250
- Girl, I am single with three kids,

45:31.250 --> 45:33.729
as if a man really wants
to be bothered with me.

45:33.729 --> 45:36.940
- Do not use that as an excuse.

45:36.940 --> 45:38.790
You have not made one single attempt.

45:39.870 --> 45:42.220
Carol, Farris is old news.

45:42.220 --> 45:44.350
Maybe you should just try and let it go.

45:44.350 --> 45:46.700
- Girl, ain't nobody
thinking about Farris.

45:46.700 --> 45:48.040
- 'Cause you can best believe,

45:48.040 --> 45:49.793
while you're miserable thinking about him,

45:49.793 --> 45:53.170
that he is doing just fine
not thinking about you.

45:53.170 --> 45:54.530
Believe that.

45:54.530 --> 45:57.342
- I wanna know where all
this dating stuff came from.

45:57.342 --> 45:58.790
- Nowhere!

45:58.790 --> 46:00.630
Nowhere, I'm just trying
to help you get rid

46:00.630 --> 46:02.116
of some of those cob webs.

46:02.116 --> 46:03.580
(laughing)

46:03.580 --> 46:05.360
- Well you are my sister and I do know

46:05.360 --> 46:07.473
how your twisted little mind thinks.

46:09.310 --> 46:11.010
- Oh, okay.

46:11.010 --> 46:14.143
What if I told you that I
hooked you up with somebody?

46:15.540 --> 46:16.940
- Dee Dee!

46:16.940 --> 46:17.773
Dee Dee wait!

46:17.773 --> 46:19.758
No, you didn't even have my permission!

46:19.758 --> 46:21.250
- I know.

46:21.250 --> 46:23.400
I know, I didn't think you would mind.

46:23.400 --> 46:25.780
- Girl, I have got enough problems at home

46:25.780 --> 46:27.720
without trying to get to know somebody.

46:27.720 --> 46:29.340
- He's just a friend that I know

46:29.340 --> 46:30.900
and he's single, what's the big deal?

46:30.900 --> 46:32.478
- I can't believe this.

46:32.478 --> 46:34.960
I just, I can't believe this.

46:34.960 --> 46:36.836
- Look, I know you're bitter

46:36.836 --> 46:38.503
and you have a right to be.

46:39.430 --> 46:42.720
But after all this time, you have not once

46:42.720 --> 46:44.620
tried to put your marriage behind you.

46:47.684 --> 46:49.234
- Dee Dee, I don't think I can.

46:50.350 --> 46:52.270
- And you really haven't
talked about it either.

46:52.270 --> 46:53.753
Now something is going on.

46:56.070 --> 46:58.310
- I just wonder if he ever you know,

46:58.310 --> 47:00.050
just if he thinks about--
- Farris?

47:00.050 --> 47:01.350
If he thinks about what?

47:01.350 --> 47:02.370
If what?

47:02.370 --> 47:04.050
- Well you would think
that after sometime,

47:04.050 --> 47:05.100
that he would pick up the phone

47:05.100 --> 47:08.211
and I don't know give an explanation for--

47:08.211 --> 47:09.150
- Why?

47:09.150 --> 47:11.350
Farris owes you nothing, he is selfish

47:11.350 --> 47:13.400
and he does not want you to have closure.

47:15.010 --> 47:16.110
That's the size of it.

47:17.593 --> 47:18.520
- I don't know Dee Dee.

47:18.520 --> 47:21.735
I just don't think I'm
ready, I really don't.

47:21.735 --> 47:23.163
♪ But now that won't do ♪

47:23.163 --> 47:24.926
♪ 'Cause I need you here with me ♪

47:24.926 --> 47:27.217
♪ To please you I'll do anything ♪

47:27.217 --> 47:28.983
♪ Don't wanna dream no more ♪

47:28.983 --> 47:30.870
♪ I wanna live my fantasy ♪

47:30.870 --> 47:32.060
- [Nicholas] My mother that I were both

47:32.060 --> 47:33.923
in places we did not want to be.

47:34.930 --> 47:36.498
Since the meeting with principal Wheeler,

47:36.498 --> 47:40.550
things for me were not exactly
going according to plan.

47:40.550 --> 47:42.250
So I knew I couldn't say anything

47:42.250 --> 47:43.410
during dinner about what happened

47:43.410 --> 47:45.630
at the restaurant with Mr. Johnson.

47:45.630 --> 47:49.710
On the other hand, my mother
wasn't doing so good herself.

47:49.710 --> 47:52.170
You see, she had really been thinking

47:52.170 --> 47:53.510
about the conversation that she had

47:53.510 --> 47:55.030
with auntie Dee Dee earlier.

47:55.030 --> 47:56.276
Especially since she hasn't seen anyone

47:56.276 --> 47:57.833
since the family split.

47:58.770 --> 48:01.640
And as for the conversation
at dinner tonight,

48:01.640 --> 48:04.083
nobody said one single word.

48:18.970 --> 48:20.270
- What are you doing here?

48:21.130 --> 48:22.500
- I think you made a mistake, sir.

48:22.500 --> 48:24.530
- The only mistake here, Nicholas is you.

48:24.530 --> 48:27.678
Please, pull the door up on your way out.

48:27.678 --> 48:30.750
- Mr. Johnson, look, I'm
sorry about yesterday.

48:30.750 --> 48:34.860
And I came today to ask
you for my job back.

48:34.860 --> 48:38.103
- Well, let's just see what
your school had to say.

48:43.450 --> 48:46.720
You have an overall
grade point average of F.

48:46.720 --> 48:50.010
You've been suspended three times.

48:50.010 --> 48:54.557
You have 45 absences and 35 tardies.

48:54.557 --> 48:58.500
The only positive thing I see
is that you might possibly

48:58.500 --> 49:00.373
be able to join the baseball team.

49:01.780 --> 49:03.070
I'm sorry, son.

49:03.070 --> 49:05.870
Please close the door on your way out.

49:05.870 --> 49:07.730
- Mr. Johnson, what am I
supposed to tell my mother?

49:07.730 --> 49:08.810
I can't tell her you fired me.

49:08.810 --> 49:09.643
- Why not?

49:12.200 --> 49:13.530
I know what's wrong.

49:13.530 --> 49:15.800
You're afraid of what she's gonna do.

49:15.800 --> 49:18.706
You're afraid she's gonna
kick you out, aren't you?

49:18.706 --> 49:21.406
Which is something she
should've done a long time ago.

49:25.010 --> 49:25.843
- Mr. Johnson.

49:30.220 --> 49:31.670
I don't know what else to do.

49:33.030 --> 49:34.720
I got nowhere else to go.

49:34.720 --> 49:37.560
- See, that's the problem
with all you teenagers.

49:37.560 --> 49:38.840
You think you know everything

49:38.840 --> 49:43.060
and the fact of the matter
is, you don't know shit!

49:43.060 --> 49:45.313
And you're too dumb to even realize it.

49:48.666 --> 49:51.013
- [Nicholas] I just want to work, sir.

49:54.270 --> 49:56.037
- Are you sure about this, son?

49:58.890 --> 49:59.840
I'll tell you what.

50:00.790 --> 50:03.730
I'm gonna go against my
better judgment this once

50:03.730 --> 50:05.670
and give you your job back.

50:05.670 --> 50:10.440
But I warn you, if you fuck up once,

50:10.440 --> 50:14.850
I'm gonna be on yo ass like white on rice.

50:14.850 --> 50:16.350
- Thank you sir.

50:16.350 --> 50:18.640
Thank you, Mr--
- Now go out in the front,

50:18.640 --> 50:19.800
I'll be out there in a minute.

50:19.800 --> 50:21.550
- [Nicholas] Alright.

50:23.352 --> 50:24.400
(cars honking)

50:24.400 --> 50:27.340
- Now you mean to tell me that a gorgeous,

50:27.340 --> 50:30.600
beautiful, attractive
woman such as yourself

50:30.600 --> 50:33.910
has not been on one single
date in three years?

50:33.910 --> 50:35.630
I'm sorry Carol, but that's kinda hard

50:35.630 --> 50:38.139
for a man of my intelligence to believe.

50:38.139 --> 50:40.989
- It's hard for me to believe
too but it's actually true.

50:41.950 --> 50:46.950
- Look Carol, separation,
divorce, whatever the case may be,

50:47.490 --> 50:49.463
is never an easy thing to overcome.

50:50.640 --> 50:55.430
- Avery I understand that but
love can make you feel so low.

50:55.430 --> 50:58.660
- True but the reality is that we all

50:58.660 --> 51:00.513
have to start over at some point.

51:02.400 --> 51:04.410
- You know, when I first got divorced,

51:04.410 --> 51:05.350
I don't know, it was so weird.

51:05.350 --> 51:08.490
It was like a huge relief,
it was like this huge cloud

51:08.490 --> 51:10.660
had been lifted off my shoulders.

51:10.660 --> 51:12.488
- Do you know why that is?

51:12.488 --> 51:13.321
- Why?

51:13.321 --> 51:14.760
- Because sometimes bad marriages

51:14.760 --> 51:16.860
have the power to destroy a person's soul.

51:18.100 --> 51:18.950
- I just kinda thought that

51:18.950 --> 51:20.520
all of our problems would be over.

51:20.520 --> 51:22.290
Well, at least the major ones.

51:22.290 --> 51:24.240
And I kinda feel like

51:24.240 --> 51:26.393
all those insecurities are still there.

51:27.460 --> 51:28.293
- Yeah.

51:29.250 --> 51:30.083
- What about you?

51:30.083 --> 51:33.170
I mean what kind of obstacles
are you trying to overcome?

51:33.170 --> 51:37.120
- Well, I must say, I've
been happily divorced

51:37.120 --> 51:41.740
and I repeat, happily divorced
for over five years now.

51:41.740 --> 51:44.602
- Okay, I got you, I got you.

51:44.602 --> 51:46.102
- Yeah.

51:46.102 --> 51:48.040
- So you like being single, yeah?

51:48.040 --> 51:50.453
- Yeah, but it didn't start off that way.

51:51.410 --> 51:53.220
Let me put it like this
and I don't wanna sound

51:53.220 --> 51:56.387
like I'm soft or sensitive or unmanly.

51:56.387 --> 51:58.850
But I'ma keep it real with you.

51:58.850 --> 52:02.083
After my divorce was final,
I was hurt, you know.

52:02.930 --> 52:04.720
I felt real empty on the inside

52:04.720 --> 52:07.460
so I did what was comfortable.

52:07.460 --> 52:12.230
I went out and I dated
as many women as I could.

52:12.230 --> 52:13.770
- Like most men.

52:13.770 --> 52:17.120
- Not like most men but like
a man who was heartbroken.

52:17.120 --> 52:19.320
But you know what my biggest downfall was?

52:19.320 --> 52:20.203
- What's that?

52:20.203 --> 52:22.160
- I thought that being with a whole bunch

52:22.160 --> 52:24.310
of different women was
gonna make me happy.

52:25.424 --> 52:27.620
- At least you had fun in the process.

52:27.620 --> 52:29.630
- Yeah, but then when the smoke cleared,

52:29.630 --> 52:31.130
the emptiness was still there.

52:31.970 --> 52:35.050
And at that moment, it
was then that I realized

52:35.050 --> 52:36.473
I had to make myself happy.

52:37.859 --> 52:40.378
- You see the lie that
people tell themselves,

52:40.378 --> 52:41.940
it's like they believe deep down inside

52:41.940 --> 52:43.010
that once they get a divorce,

52:43.010 --> 52:44.463
that they can easily replace that person

52:44.463 --> 52:47.780
that they've been married to for years.

52:47.780 --> 52:50.530
- It's easier said than done, Carol.

52:50.530 --> 52:52.530
You see, it just doesn't work like that.

52:52.530 --> 52:54.143
Not when emotions are involved.

52:55.210 --> 52:56.593
- Yeah, I agree.
- Yeah.

52:58.499 --> 53:01.416
(glasses clinking)

53:04.090 --> 53:05.080
- This is the bar area.

53:05.080 --> 53:06.740
This is where you'll be working.

53:06.740 --> 53:09.443
And this is where people will
be picking up their food.

53:10.760 --> 53:13.570
You do know how to take orders, don't you?

53:13.570 --> 53:14.950
- Yeah, of course, sure.

53:14.950 --> 53:16.430
Yeah, I know how.
- Well, good.

53:16.430 --> 53:20.225
Take the orders and always
keep this area clean.

53:20.225 --> 53:21.490
- Right, okay.

53:21.490 --> 53:24.550
Hey, Mr. Johnson, who are
these people on the wall?

53:24.550 --> 53:27.280
- Oh, that's what I call
my workers hall of fame.

53:27.280 --> 53:29.980
Those are all the former
knuckleheads like yourself

53:29.980 --> 53:32.167
that used to work here (laughs).

53:32.167 --> 53:33.670
- You must be proud of all of them.

53:33.670 --> 53:35.640
- Oh yes, it's been some really good kids

53:35.640 --> 53:38.120
to come through here over the years.

53:38.120 --> 53:40.500
- Avery, I had such a
good time this evening.

53:40.500 --> 53:42.390
Thank you so much.

53:42.390 --> 53:45.723
Well, I hope I didn't
bore you with my past.

53:45.723 --> 53:47.210
- You didn't bore me, and you needed

53:47.210 --> 53:49.111
to get that out of your system.

53:49.111 --> 53:51.739
♪ When you had to love somebody ♪

53:51.739 --> 53:54.613
♪ When you wanna hold somebody ♪

53:54.613 --> 53:58.180
- Wow, I hope Dee Dee didn't
give you the wrong impression

53:58.180 --> 54:00.447
but Avery I do have to go in alone.

54:00.447 --> 54:02.192
You do understand?

54:02.192 --> 54:03.900
- Yeah, yeah, sure.

54:03.900 --> 54:05.147
I hope you didn't think I was trying to--

54:05.147 --> 54:05.980
- No, no.

54:08.768 --> 54:10.387
- I'll tell you what, I'll
just see you later then.

54:10.387 --> 54:11.830
- Okay, thank you.
- You're welcome.

54:28.970 --> 54:30.220
- [Monica] I had a call-in order.

54:30.220 --> 54:31.827
- What's the name?

54:31.827 --> 54:33.677
- [Monica] Phillips, Monica Phillips.

54:36.960 --> 54:40.190
- Uh yeah, let me, let
me see if I can find it.

54:44.640 --> 54:45.523
- Wait a minute.

54:46.490 --> 54:48.227
We go to school together, right?

54:48.227 --> 54:49.987
- Yeah, yeah.

54:49.987 --> 54:52.030
We do, we go to the same...

54:57.680 --> 54:58.563
Ah here it is.

55:00.970 --> 55:02.553
That'll be $8 even.

55:09.030 --> 55:10.460
There's your receipt.
- Thanks.

55:10.460 --> 55:12.510
- And I'll be right back with your order.

55:28.150 --> 55:30.980
Alright, Philly cheese steak, extra cheese

55:30.980 --> 55:34.678
and I put you some extra
napkins in the bag.

55:34.678 --> 55:35.678
Here you go.

55:37.811 --> 55:38.644
- Thanks.

55:43.920 --> 55:45.683
- Hey Monica, wait up!

55:49.210 --> 55:52.380
Hi. Um, listen.

55:52.380 --> 55:55.840
I was, I usually don't do this but...

55:59.920 --> 56:01.993
Look, how about you give me your number?

56:01.993 --> 56:02.993
- My number?

56:03.950 --> 56:05.280
- Well, yeah, I was hoping

56:05.280 --> 56:08.600
to talk to you outside of this place.

56:08.600 --> 56:10.343
- No, no.

56:11.850 --> 56:13.137
I don't think so, no.

56:14.230 --> 56:15.770
- Why not?

56:15.770 --> 56:18.440
- I just don't think
it's a very good idea.

56:18.440 --> 56:19.460
No offense.

56:33.320 --> 56:34.870
- Can you help me with this?

56:34.870 --> 56:35.773
- Sure baby.

56:37.100 --> 56:38.650
Let's see what's going on here.

56:39.710 --> 56:41.270
Okay, see where you added...

56:44.208 --> 56:46.192
(phone ringing)

56:46.192 --> 56:47.609
Hang on, sweetie.

56:51.990 --> 56:52.823
Hello?

56:53.770 --> 56:57.210
Hey girl, nothing, just helping
Marcus with his homework

56:57.210 --> 56:59.060
and Nicholas is still at the restaurant.

56:59.060 --> 56:59.893
What's going on?

56:59.893 --> 57:02.330
- Well, what's the 4-1-1 on your date?

57:02.330 --> 57:03.623
Dish me all the gossip.

57:09.520 --> 57:12.301
- This is a nice place
you got here Mr. Johnson.

57:12.301 --> 57:13.840
You must be real proud of yourself.

57:13.840 --> 57:15.881
- Oh, I do okay.

57:15.881 --> 57:17.730
- Were you in the
restaurant business forever,

57:17.730 --> 57:18.870
like your whole life?

57:18.870 --> 57:21.770
- No, I played professional
baseball for 13 years.

57:21.770 --> 57:22.710
- Oh what?

57:22.710 --> 57:24.340
Get out of here, I
would've never guessed it.

57:24.340 --> 57:25.280
That's pretty cool.

57:25.280 --> 57:27.650
- I grinded out the first
12 in the Minor Leagues

57:27.650 --> 57:31.710
and finally in the last year
I got called up by the Cubs.

57:31.710 --> 57:32.640
- Man, that must've been rough

57:32.640 --> 57:34.460
to play in the Minor
League that whole time.

57:34.460 --> 57:36.293
- Well, it made me mentally tough.

57:37.213 --> 57:38.780
It gave me a chance to appreciate

57:38.780 --> 57:40.313
what baseball has to offer.

57:42.970 --> 57:44.893
- You know my dad used to always say that.

57:45.862 --> 57:47.563
- Well your dad was right.

57:48.768 --> 57:49.601
- He used to always say

57:49.601 --> 57:52.303
that baseball was a thinking man's game.

57:53.338 --> 57:55.723
- I'm gonna tell you
something about life, son.

57:57.040 --> 58:00.353
Life is 10% physical and 90% mental.

58:03.680 --> 58:05.713
And not to mention,

58:08.950 --> 58:11.606
I didn't do half bad
with the ladies either.

58:11.606 --> 58:13.856
(laughing)

58:16.630 --> 58:17.463
- Okay.

58:18.680 --> 58:20.540
- Oh, we just had dinner and then

58:20.540 --> 58:22.410
he went on about his merry way.

58:22.410 --> 58:23.243
- And?

58:24.109 --> 58:25.630
That's it, no hugs, no kisses?

58:25.630 --> 58:28.270
- I don't know Dee Dee,
I'm just not like that.

58:28.270 --> 58:29.550
Besides, telling you it's like

58:29.550 --> 58:31.645
putting it all over the six o'clock news.

58:31.645 --> 58:33.710
(laughs)

58:33.710 --> 58:35.580
- Now that's my biggest problem, you know?

58:35.580 --> 58:38.180
I never know what to
say around girls, ever.

58:38.180 --> 58:39.400
- Well, you're still a young man.

58:39.400 --> 58:40.770
You're still learning.

58:40.770 --> 58:43.520
It's not as difficult as it seems.

58:43.520 --> 58:46.010
- You know, I'm a nobody at school.

58:46.010 --> 58:47.690
You know, I'll be honest.

58:47.690 --> 58:51.209
Girls tend to go for the
more popular guy and...

58:51.209 --> 58:53.120
- Yeah well, that's true.

58:53.120 --> 58:55.090
But you're still trying
to get your feet wet.

58:55.090 --> 58:56.893
You just have to do the unexpected.

58:59.041 --> 59:00.037
- I don't understand.

59:00.037 --> 59:01.540
What do you mean unexpected?

59:01.540 --> 59:03.640
- If a young man does the unexpected,

59:03.640 --> 59:06.040
the young lady will usually
do the rest for him.

59:07.720 --> 59:09.867
- Mr. Johnson, I'm really slow.

59:09.867 --> 59:11.774
You have to really explain this to me.

59:11.774 --> 59:12.624
What do you mean?

59:14.520 --> 59:18.453
- The unexpected is that you
simply have to be yourself.

59:20.070 --> 59:24.555
- [Nicholas] Hey, I wanna
apologize about the other day.

59:24.555 --> 59:26.840
I must have sounded like a complete idiot.

59:26.840 --> 59:27.830
- [Monica] Apologize?

59:27.830 --> 59:29.423
Apologize to me for what?

59:30.523 --> 59:32.820
- [Nicholas] See, I don't
know how to say this

59:32.820 --> 59:35.580
but like I get kinda nervous around girls,

59:35.580 --> 59:39.050
so I didn't wanna come off as being

59:39.050 --> 59:40.650
disrespectful or rude
to you or anything, so.

59:40.650 --> 59:42.620
- [Monica] No, don't worry about it.

59:42.620 --> 59:45.210
Really if anybody should be
apologizing for anything,

59:45.210 --> 59:47.500
it should probably be me.

59:47.500 --> 59:49.200
- [Nicholas] Why should you apologize?

59:49.200 --> 59:50.980
- [Monica] Well, believe
it or not but sometimes

59:50.980 --> 59:53.550
I can be pretty rude and obnoxious.

59:53.550 --> 59:56.400
It's probably the biggest
thing that I hate about myself.

59:57.857 --> 59:58.852
- [Nicholas] I hadn't noticed.

59:58.852 --> 01:00:00.290
(laughing)

01:00:00.290 --> 01:00:01.830
- [Monica] I may be the head cheerleader

01:00:01.830 --> 01:00:03.860
but I'm definitely not the most popular

01:00:03.860 --> 01:00:06.230
person with the other students.

01:00:06.230 --> 01:00:08.420
- [Nicholas] Well, getting
to know people takes time.

01:00:08.420 --> 01:00:10.890
I mean, Rome wasn't built
in one day, you know?

01:00:10.890 --> 01:00:12.000
Come on!

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:12.950
- [Monica] I guess.

01:00:15.800 --> 01:00:16.950
- Alright, miss Monica.

01:00:18.087 --> 01:00:19.430
I gotta ask you something.

01:00:19.430 --> 01:00:21.930
I need your advice.
- Advice?

01:00:21.930 --> 01:00:23.480
Right now I'm probably the last person

01:00:23.480 --> 01:00:25.073
you wanna take advice from.

01:00:25.073 --> 01:00:28.297
- No, no, you can help,
I think you can help.

01:00:28.297 --> 01:00:33.220
You see, there's this
particular young lady

01:00:33.220 --> 01:00:37.620
who I'm really, really
interested in getting to know

01:00:37.620 --> 01:00:41.003
but the thing is I have no
clue what to say to her.

01:00:42.340 --> 01:00:43.640
- Well that all depends.

01:00:43.640 --> 01:00:46.260
Is this young lady pretty?

01:00:46.260 --> 01:00:47.600
- Pretty?

01:00:47.600 --> 01:00:50.750
Pretty is an understatement,
she's gorgeous!

01:00:50.750 --> 01:00:52.316
But you know what?

01:00:52.316 --> 01:00:54.133
That's not the first thing
you notice about her.

01:00:57.360 --> 01:00:59.750
- So where did you come from?

01:00:59.750 --> 01:01:02.653
That day in the cafeteria
was the first time I saw you.

01:01:03.870 --> 01:01:04.870
- It doesn't matter.

01:01:06.340 --> 01:01:10.087
All that matters is I never wanna go back.

01:01:10.087 --> 01:01:11.230
- I understand.

01:01:11.230 --> 01:01:14.390
I just moved here myself
after my mom and dad split,

01:01:14.390 --> 01:01:16.603
I came here to live with my grandparents.

01:01:17.510 --> 01:01:20.403
- I know what that's like
when parents splitting up.

01:01:20.403 --> 01:01:22.210
And being in unfamiliar territory,

01:01:22.210 --> 01:01:23.860
it's strange sometimes, you know?

01:01:23.860 --> 01:01:25.910
- Right, it's not the
best place in the world

01:01:25.910 --> 01:01:28.473
but it's so much better
than where you came from.

01:01:29.580 --> 01:01:30.480
- Don't I know it?

01:01:31.480 --> 01:01:33.820
Wake up now, go to sleep now!

01:01:33.820 --> 01:01:35.780
- Join this squad, join that squad.

01:01:35.780 --> 01:01:38.380
- You're moving too fast.
- You're moving too slow.

01:01:41.240 --> 01:01:44.300
- Yeah, you know
sometimes parents can just

01:01:44.300 --> 01:01:46.280
make you feel so--
- Make you feel so

01:01:46.280 --> 01:01:47.553
Trapped.
- Trapped.

01:01:54.680 --> 01:01:57.420
Man, I'm telling you Mr.
Johnson, this girl is cool.

01:01:57.420 --> 01:02:00.150
She actually listened to
every word I had to say.

01:02:00.150 --> 01:02:02.053
- Man, women never cease to amaze me.

01:02:03.170 --> 01:02:06.157
- She listened like to everything
that came out of my mouth.

01:02:06.157 --> 01:02:08.150
- Oh you can get used to that.

01:02:08.150 --> 01:02:10.410
Girls hearing the words that
are coming out of your mouth.

01:02:10.410 --> 01:02:11.243
I'ma teach you everything

01:02:11.243 --> 01:02:13.123
there is to know about talking to girls.

01:02:14.929 --> 01:02:17.846
(soft piano music)

01:02:19.010 --> 01:02:20.300
- [Nicholas] I can
honestly say that things

01:02:20.300 --> 01:02:22.851
were finally coming together for me.

01:02:22.851 --> 01:02:25.751
I feel like I have been given
a brand new purpose in life.

01:02:26.750 --> 01:02:28.740
I didn't know where I was headed

01:02:28.740 --> 01:02:31.490
but I knew for sure that I
was not gonna turn back now.

01:02:32.540 --> 01:02:34.660
Mr. Johnson was the
first positive role model

01:02:34.660 --> 01:02:36.210
that ever had patience with me.

01:02:37.930 --> 01:02:40.070
He was the kind of person
that was very easy to talk to

01:02:40.070 --> 01:02:43.230
and I felt like I could
just tell him anything.

01:02:43.230 --> 01:02:44.800
He had given me that fatherly affection

01:02:44.800 --> 01:02:46.993
that I never received from my own father.

01:02:48.530 --> 01:02:51.750
I pulled my grades up and who knows?

01:02:51.750 --> 01:02:53.700
I might even have a new girlfriend too.

01:02:54.690 --> 01:02:57.113
Everything else going so good in my life.

01:02:58.250 --> 01:03:00.950
I knew that there was one
last thing I had to conquer.

01:03:04.530 --> 01:03:05.900
- This is where it all began for me

01:03:05.900 --> 01:03:07.250
right here on this diamond.

01:03:08.280 --> 01:03:09.463
I owe my life to this.

01:03:11.130 --> 01:03:14.620
I grew up in Mississippi, I
was a fan of Satchel Paige

01:03:14.620 --> 01:03:16.863
and Josh Gibson of the old Negro Leagues.

01:03:17.835 --> 01:03:21.250
And I loved Jackie
Robison and Elston Howard,

01:03:21.250 --> 01:03:23.730
the first black man to play
for the New York Yankees.

01:03:23.730 --> 01:03:24.563
- I didn't know that.

01:03:25.800 --> 01:03:27.290
- When I was five years
old, I caught a game

01:03:27.290 --> 01:03:29.520
that Willie Mays played in for
the Birmingham Black Barrons.

01:03:29.520 --> 01:03:30.670
- Is that right?
- Yeah.

01:03:30.670 --> 01:03:31.543
- Oh man!

01:03:32.770 --> 01:03:35.739
- So you say you wanna
make the baseball team.

01:03:35.739 --> 01:03:36.810
- Yeah.

01:03:36.810 --> 01:03:39.510
- Now it's my job to make
sure that you reach that goal.

01:03:41.287 --> 01:03:43.750
(soft music)

01:03:43.750 --> 01:03:45.200
Let's get ready to play ball.

01:03:46.109 --> 01:03:47.160
Now I want you to concentrate

01:03:47.160 --> 01:03:49.170
on what you're doing out there.

01:03:49.170 --> 01:03:51.400
But remember, your sole purpose

01:03:51.400 --> 01:03:54.500
for being out there is to have fun.

01:03:54.500 --> 01:03:55.663
Don't ever forget that.

01:04:08.754 --> 01:04:11.892
Now that's what I'm talking about.

01:04:11.892 --> 01:04:12.725
Yeah!

01:04:22.439 --> 01:04:24.791
(clears throat)

01:04:24.791 --> 01:04:27.791
(people chattering)

01:04:30.580 --> 01:04:31.543
- I met somebody.

01:04:36.170 --> 01:04:37.370
- What did you just say?

01:04:39.630 --> 01:04:42.080
- I said I met somebody,
you know, just a friend.

01:04:44.880 --> 01:04:47.900
Well, your aunt Dee
Dee kinda introduced me

01:04:47.900 --> 01:04:49.100
to a gentleman that she knew

01:04:49.100 --> 01:04:52.590
and we just kinda went
out to dinner, that's all.

01:04:52.590 --> 01:04:55.173
I just, I didn't wanna tell you

01:04:55.173 --> 01:04:56.660
because I don't want you to think

01:04:56.660 --> 01:04:58.470
that I was trying to
hide anything from you

01:04:58.470 --> 01:05:01.280
and well, with everything
that's been going,

01:05:01.280 --> 01:05:02.650
I just don't wanna add to the problem--

01:05:02.650 --> 01:05:03.700
- I met somebody too.

01:05:07.290 --> 01:05:09.040
- I'm sorry, what did you just say?

01:05:13.950 --> 01:05:17.410
- I'm happy you went
out and had a good time

01:05:17.410 --> 01:05:21.430
and met somebody and I
said I met somebody too.

01:05:21.430 --> 01:05:23.023
- Well, who's the lucky girl?

01:05:24.440 --> 01:05:25.410
- Her name is Monica.

01:05:25.410 --> 01:05:26.940
We go to the same school.

01:05:26.940 --> 01:05:28.050
- It's nice to see that everything

01:05:28.050 --> 01:05:30.000
is working out around here.

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:33.530
- Yeah, you'd actually like
her too, she's pretty cool.

01:05:33.530 --> 01:05:38.113
- So tell me more about Monica.

01:05:39.649 --> 01:05:44.649
(school bell rings)
(upbeat music)

01:05:47.259 --> 01:05:50.050
- So how does it feel
to be an official adult?

01:05:50.050 --> 01:05:51.522
- 18 years old, man.

01:05:51.522 --> 01:05:53.950
- Hey, are you going to
the party tonight, man?

01:05:53.950 --> 01:05:55.722
- No, I can't make it, dude, I gotta work.

01:05:55.722 --> 01:05:57.953
- Ah, it won't be the
same without you there.

01:05:57.953 --> 01:06:00.250
- That's right, a party
at the Burlington's

01:06:00.250 --> 01:06:02.385
won't feel the same without
you in the corner all night.

01:06:02.385 --> 01:06:03.759
(laughing)

01:06:03.759 --> 01:06:04.592
- That's alright.

01:06:04.592 --> 01:06:05.480
- I know that's right.
- It's cool.

01:06:05.480 --> 01:06:07.220
Yeah I know, I know.

01:06:09.400 --> 01:06:11.060
- Hey guys.

01:06:11.060 --> 01:06:13.947
- Hey, what's up?
- What's up?

01:06:13.947 --> 01:06:16.430
- Hey, I'll see y'all later, huh?

01:06:16.430 --> 01:06:19.010
- Yeah, yeah, it's about that time.

01:06:19.010 --> 01:06:19.843
- [Nicholas] Alright man,
y'all have fun tonight.

01:06:19.843 --> 01:06:21.494
- [William] Don't do
nothing I wouldn't do.

01:06:21.494 --> 01:06:22.327
- [Nicholas] Right.

01:06:22.327 --> 01:06:23.160
- [Nate] Alright man,
you take it easy now.

01:06:23.160 --> 01:06:23.993
- You too now.

01:06:25.894 --> 01:06:26.727
Y'all be safe.

01:06:29.007 --> 01:06:33.060
So Nicholas, what do you
have planned for tonight?

01:06:33.060 --> 01:06:36.934
- Oh, tonight is not a
special occasion at all,

01:06:36.934 --> 01:06:38.101
you know that.

01:06:39.197 --> 01:06:40.030
- What?

01:06:41.160 --> 01:06:45.493
Well, what would you say if
I asked you to take off work?

01:06:47.750 --> 01:06:49.330
- Monica, it's Friday, come on.

01:06:49.330 --> 01:06:50.570
It's our busiest night.

01:06:50.570 --> 01:06:51.996
- So what?
- I told Mr. Johnson

01:06:51.996 --> 01:06:53.283
I'd be there.

01:06:54.600 --> 01:06:57.830
- I just feel like I wanna
do something special.

01:06:57.830 --> 01:07:00.500
I mean, compared to other people,

01:07:00.500 --> 01:07:03.222
since we met you made me feel different

01:07:03.222 --> 01:07:05.953
like I really mattered to you.

01:07:08.382 --> 01:07:09.215
Please?

01:07:10.209 --> 01:07:13.126
(soft piano music)

01:07:18.032 --> 01:07:20.949

- You can begin by letting yourself out.

01:08:18.060 --> 01:08:19.307
- Hey (laughs softly).

01:08:20.560 --> 01:08:23.198
You know I thought we
can talk about the things

01:08:23.198 --> 01:08:26.033
that well, you know,
that people talk about

01:08:26.033 --> 01:08:28.193
that usually care for each other.

01:08:29.430 --> 01:08:31.750
- Don't you dare play mind
games with me, Farris.

01:08:31.750 --> 01:08:33.319
You are in my house.

01:08:33.319 --> 01:08:35.120
Now I want you to understand
that you came here

01:08:35.120 --> 01:08:38.082
in one piece and you better
pray you leave the same way.

01:08:39.050 --> 01:08:41.993
- Okay, okay.

01:08:43.229 --> 01:08:47.130
But just let me go ahead and say my peace

01:08:47.130 --> 01:08:49.183
and then I'll go right on my way.

01:08:52.308 --> 01:08:55.743
Baby I'm so miserable without you.

01:08:57.020 --> 01:09:00.560
It's not one day, not one
day that goes by Carol

01:09:00.560 --> 01:09:02.660
that I don't think about you.

01:09:02.660 --> 01:09:05.108
- You had sex with your secretary

01:09:05.108 --> 01:09:08.029
in our bathroom, in our house.

01:09:08.029 --> 01:09:11.840
Do you have any idea
what you put me through?

01:09:11.840 --> 01:09:13.683
Let alone this family!

01:09:14.620 --> 01:09:16.420
Do you, Farris?

01:09:16.420 --> 01:09:20.287
- Baby, do you still me want me?

01:09:20.287 --> 01:09:21.819
Do you still love me?

01:09:21.819 --> 01:09:24.020
- That ain't got nothing
to do with nothing.

01:09:26.620 --> 01:09:30.229
- Carol, listen to me, we used to have

01:09:30.229 --> 01:09:34.560
some good times together and
I know you remember them.

01:09:35.450 --> 01:09:37.109
I know you remember them.

01:09:38.500 --> 01:09:42.609
You know, Carol life is
just like a baseball game.

01:09:42.609 --> 01:09:45.143
You have to go out there everyday.

01:09:46.859 --> 01:09:49.620
That's right, to live my life thinking

01:09:51.020 --> 01:09:56.020
that I can replace what I had
with you with someone else.

01:09:57.920 --> 01:10:01.030
But baby, over the course of time,

01:10:01.030 --> 01:10:03.543
I realized that I could never,

01:10:04.470 --> 01:10:07.053
I could never replace my wife.

01:10:08.970 --> 01:10:11.860
So baby, I'm here to say I'm sorry

01:10:11.860 --> 01:10:13.510
and I want you to come back home.

01:10:21.046 --> 01:10:23.463
(door shuts)

01:10:24.670 --> 01:10:28.800
- You will not believe what
happened to me tonight.

01:10:28.800 --> 01:10:29.633
Oh man.

01:10:31.550 --> 01:10:33.890
- I love you Carol.

01:10:33.890 --> 01:10:37.120
Let's be a family again, Carol.

01:10:37.120 --> 01:10:39.140
Do you know this man
had the audacity to try

01:10:39.140 --> 01:10:42.370
and make me feel guilty
after I caught him cheating?

01:10:42.370 --> 01:10:44.610
- I hope you're not mad that
I told him where you were.

01:10:44.610 --> 01:10:46.600
- Girl, no, you're my sister.

01:10:46.600 --> 01:10:48.620
You know, I didn't realize
that I had so many emotions

01:10:48.620 --> 01:10:50.021
bottled up inside of me.

01:10:50.021 --> 01:10:51.393
It was like a huge relief.

01:10:52.740 --> 01:10:54.090
- So what are you gonna do?

01:10:54.090 --> 01:10:55.703
You obviously still care.

01:10:56.557 --> 01:10:57.420
- I don't know.

01:10:57.420 --> 01:10:59.170
I mean the boys are doing so well here

01:10:59.170 --> 01:11:02.000
and girl, this is my home now.

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:04.270
- Home is where the heart is.

01:11:04.270 --> 01:11:06.360
Take it from me Carol,
you do not wanna spend

01:11:06.360 --> 01:11:07.510
the rest of your life wondering

01:11:07.510 --> 01:11:09.980
if you and your husband
could've worked things out.

01:11:09.980 --> 01:11:11.570
- So hypothetically speaking,

01:11:11.570 --> 01:11:13.820
if Nate and William's father
came back into your life,

01:11:13.820 --> 01:11:15.931
would you accept him?

01:11:15.931 --> 01:11:17.363
- Oh, hell no!

01:11:19.207 --> 01:11:22.207
(people chattering)

01:11:26.920 --> 01:11:28.830
- [Nicholas] So how do I look?

01:11:28.830 --> 01:11:32.600
- So you made the baseball
team, that's real good.

01:11:32.600 --> 01:11:33.920
I'm proud of you son.

01:11:33.920 --> 01:11:35.819
- Oh man, thanks a lot Mr. Johnson,

01:11:35.819 --> 01:11:37.569
that means so much to me.

01:11:37.569 --> 01:11:39.229
I had the final trials
yesterday after school

01:11:39.229 --> 01:11:42.518
and coach handed these out
this morning, pretty cool, huh?

01:11:42.518 --> 01:11:45.206
(soft piano music)

01:11:45.206 --> 01:11:47.300
You know, I got a few
weeks 'til the first game,

01:11:47.300 --> 01:11:50.133
you know, maybe we can work
on my swing a little bit.

01:11:57.060 --> 01:11:58.620
Mr. Johnson, what's wrong?

01:11:58.620 --> 01:12:00.173
You don't seem happy at all.

01:12:01.092 --> 01:12:03.069
- Oh, I am happy for you.

01:12:03.069 --> 01:12:06.520
I just don't think you're
gonna be working here anymore.

01:12:06.520 --> 01:12:07.640
- Of course I will.

01:12:07.640 --> 01:12:10.140
Come on, the days I don't got games,

01:12:10.140 --> 01:12:11.760
I can come in and work,
it's not a big deal--

01:12:11.760 --> 01:12:15.729
- Nick, you being on the
baseball team is not the problem.

01:12:15.729 --> 01:12:18.396
- Okay, then what's the problem?

01:12:23.680 --> 01:12:24.820
What's he doing here?

01:12:24.820 --> 01:12:26.930
- He ain't looking for ice cream.

01:12:26.930 --> 01:12:29.806
He came here over an
hour ago looking for you.

01:12:29.806 --> 01:12:32.020
I think you ought to go
out there and talk to him.

01:12:32.020 --> 01:12:35.243
- No, no, not at all, Mr. Johnson.

01:12:35.243 --> 01:12:37.770
I have nothing to say to Ricky, nothing.

01:12:37.770 --> 01:12:38.920
- Now you listen to me.

01:12:40.200 --> 01:12:42.133
You once told me I had made a mistake.

01:12:43.160 --> 01:12:44.710
What if I hadn't listen to you?

01:12:53.410 --> 01:12:54.593
- Long time, no see.

01:12:55.532 --> 01:12:56.893
- What are you doing here, Ricky?

01:12:57.770 --> 01:12:58.970
- Won't you have a seat?

01:13:06.730 --> 01:13:08.600
Just came to see what's up.

01:13:08.600 --> 01:13:10.393
See how my little brother was doing.

01:13:11.257 --> 01:13:13.457
- You know, after dad paid
mom that little visit...

01:13:14.370 --> 01:13:17.290
I knew it was only a matter
of time before you'd be here.

01:13:17.290 --> 01:13:20.130
- Listen, Nicholas, this
is serious business.

01:13:20.130 --> 01:13:21.533
No fooling around.

01:13:24.840 --> 01:13:26.180
I'm gonna turn pro.

01:13:26.180 --> 01:13:27.080
- What?
- That's right!

01:13:27.080 --> 01:13:29.233
I'm gonna turn pro.

01:13:30.170 --> 01:13:32.673
I mean, who knows where I'm gonna end up.

01:13:35.570 --> 01:13:36.780
- Did somebody put you up to this?

01:13:36.780 --> 01:13:39.810
- No, this is my decision.

01:13:39.810 --> 01:13:43.023
I haven't told anybody about
this and I do mean anybody.

01:13:44.360 --> 01:13:45.443
Not even our father.

01:13:47.110 --> 01:13:49.883
- Okay, so what does any
of this have to do with me?

01:13:50.860 --> 01:13:53.110
- I'm gonna talk to my
old high school coach.

01:13:54.180 --> 01:13:55.730
I could probably get
you on the baseball team

01:13:55.730 --> 01:13:58.570
before the season even starts.

01:13:58.570 --> 01:14:01.163
Since I was hoping that
you'd be moving back home.

01:14:02.770 --> 01:14:06.940
- No, in fact, hell no!

01:14:06.940 --> 01:14:08.390
Ricky I don't need your help!

01:14:09.860 --> 01:14:11.460
I'm perfectly fine where I am, okay?

01:14:11.460 --> 01:14:12.740
Thank you.

01:14:12.740 --> 01:14:15.780
- As always, that's your damn problem.

01:14:15.780 --> 01:14:18.563
You never wanted to listen to anybody.

01:14:22.780 --> 01:14:23.930
- You know what, Ricky?

01:14:27.360 --> 01:14:29.153
I think back to when we were little,

01:14:30.930 --> 01:14:33.353
when you won the Little League's
Player of the Year Award.

01:14:35.430 --> 01:14:39.270
Dad must have took like five, six,

01:14:39.270 --> 01:14:41.764
maybe even seven rolls of film on you.

01:14:41.764 --> 01:14:44.450
That was like the
greatest day of his life.

01:14:44.450 --> 01:14:48.480
From that day on, I grew up just wishing,

01:14:51.820 --> 01:14:52.940
praying and just hoping

01:14:52.940 --> 01:14:54.840
that I could be just like you someday.

01:14:58.770 --> 01:15:00.370
But I had to learn the hard way.

01:15:01.840 --> 01:15:03.693
I'm not you!

01:15:05.703 --> 01:15:08.123
And I could never be you.

01:15:11.660 --> 01:15:13.843
It's hard enough in life
just trying to be me.

01:15:16.260 --> 01:15:18.533
- So I guess that makes
you a man now, huh?

01:15:19.607 --> 01:15:21.573
- Life is like a game of baseball, Ricky.

01:15:22.807 --> 01:15:23.857
You play it everyday.

01:15:40.770 --> 01:15:43.773
- Not talking about it is
not gonna make it go away.

01:15:45.410 --> 01:15:46.960
You're gonna leave, aren't you?

01:15:51.320 --> 01:15:53.073
- Yes, no.

01:15:54.923 --> 01:15:56.153
I don't even know.

01:15:58.970 --> 01:16:02.270
- I thought you made a better
life for yourself here.

01:16:02.270 --> 01:16:04.293
Why go back to the same disappointments?

01:16:05.860 --> 01:16:07.507
- It's my mother, you know?

01:16:09.428 --> 01:16:12.420
I can't let her down, I
put her through too much.

01:16:12.420 --> 01:16:13.620
I gotta do what's right.

01:16:16.228 --> 01:16:17.280
- Do you know how long it took me

01:16:17.280 --> 01:16:19.493
to find somebody that
truly believes in me?

01:16:21.238 --> 01:16:23.571
I just don't want you to go.

01:16:25.240 --> 01:16:26.250
- I don't wanna go either

01:16:26.250 --> 01:16:29.273
but life throws curve balls sometimes.

01:16:30.240 --> 01:16:31.493
You just gotta adjust.

01:16:33.150 --> 01:16:35.060
And I'll call you everyday
and I'll come visit you

01:16:35.060 --> 01:16:37.075
every weekend, it'll be like I never left.

01:16:37.075 --> 01:16:38.440
Come on, you know, come on.

01:16:38.440 --> 01:16:39.983
- Sure, you'll call everyday?

01:16:41.810 --> 01:16:43.110
- Like clockwork.

01:16:43.110 --> 01:16:44.595
Come on, you think I wouldn't?

01:16:44.595 --> 01:16:46.320
- And then everyday will
turn into once a week

01:16:46.320 --> 01:16:48.290
and once a week will
turn into once a month

01:16:48.290 --> 01:16:50.937
and before you know it,
the ties will be broken.

01:16:52.002 --> 01:16:54.188
(soft piano music)

01:16:54.188 --> 01:16:56.938
(birds chirping)

01:17:02.723 --> 01:17:04.610
- [Nicholas] From the time
my mother left my father

01:17:04.610 --> 01:17:08.423
up to this point, I truly believe
she was not a happy woman.

01:17:09.400 --> 01:17:12.660
When she decided that we
would leave three years ago,

01:17:12.660 --> 01:17:14.620
there was truly a major void in her life

01:17:14.620 --> 01:17:16.733
that no other man was able to fill.

01:17:17.980 --> 01:17:20.300
Life can be tricky like that sometimes.

01:17:20.300 --> 01:17:23.620
You see, deep down inside, my mother knew

01:17:23.620 --> 01:17:26.570
that her heart never completely left home.

01:17:26.570 --> 01:17:29.550
And she felt that she
did not have enough time

01:17:29.550 --> 01:17:30.813
to completely start over.

01:17:32.320 --> 01:17:35.293
I guess you can say she just
simply wanted to be happy.

01:17:36.990 --> 01:17:39.750
As for me, I didn't wanna
leave the foundation

01:17:39.750 --> 01:17:40.900
I had built for myself.

01:17:41.860 --> 01:17:44.943
Either way, my decision
was not going to be easy.

01:17:45.834 --> 01:17:47.112
(knocking on door)

01:17:47.112 --> 01:17:47.945
- Come in!

01:17:49.062 --> 01:17:51.823
- Well, finished all my work.

01:17:51.823 --> 01:17:54.250
It's really slow out there today.

01:17:54.250 --> 01:17:55.083
- Okay.

01:17:56.520 --> 01:18:01.520
- So, my work here is done
and I guess this is it.

01:18:04.500 --> 01:18:06.050
- So you're breaking out on me.

01:18:07.920 --> 01:18:09.563
- Yeah, this is goodbye.

01:18:14.040 --> 01:18:15.790
Thanks for everything, Mr. Johnson.

01:18:19.162 --> 01:18:22.079
(soft piano music)

01:18:56.335 --> 01:18:57.668
- That's my boy!

01:19:01.335 --> 01:19:03.752
(applauding)

01:19:50.772 --> 01:19:52.208
What's wrong with you?

01:19:52.208 --> 01:19:53.950
Where's your mind?

01:19:53.950 --> 01:19:55.920
Get that smile off your face, Marcus,

01:19:55.920 --> 01:19:57.550
this is a serious matter.

01:19:57.550 --> 01:19:59.620
I told you to concentrate on the baseball

01:19:59.620 --> 01:20:01.820
when you're out here
in the field, didn't I?

01:20:02.956 --> 01:20:04.620
(knocking on door)

01:20:04.620 --> 01:20:05.463
- Come in!

01:20:12.916 --> 01:20:14.610
- [Nicholas] I came to
ask you my old job back.

01:20:14.610 --> 01:20:16.995
- Hey, knucklehead.

01:20:16.995 --> 01:20:20.293
Boy I see you in a dog's age.

01:20:21.493 --> 01:20:23.224
Come on, let me show you
around the restaurant.

01:20:23.224 --> 01:20:24.601
- Let's do it.

01:20:24.601 --> 01:20:26.901
