How can the PAW Patrol help?

<i> Prepare to perform!</i>

01:50.478 --> 01:52.945

<i> if someone other than</i>
<i> Mr. Porter's pie juggling act</i>

01:55.716 --> 01:57.583
<i> took home the trophy...</i>
<i> for once.</i>

01:57.585 --> 02:00.018
I don't know,
pie juggling's pretty awesome,

02:00.020 --> 02:02.187
but we'll see what we can do.

02:02.189 --> 02:03.288
Pups, Mayor Goodway

02:03.290 --> 02:06.225
wants you all the do something
in the talent show.

02:06.227 --> 02:08.894
We can rescue someone.

02:08.896 --> 02:09.695
(Laughing)

02:09.697 --> 02:11.063
You're all talented rescuers,

02:11.065 --> 02:14.666
but this is a chance for you to
try something different.

02:14.668 --> 02:16.835
Uhh... like...

02:16.837 --> 02:18.303
we could play fetch!

02:22.710 --> 02:27.179
Yeah! We could wash our trucks
for the talent show.

02:28.315 --> 02:32.284
I think Ryder meant
we could play music.

02:32.286 --> 02:34.419

The water main
under his field burst

06:27.621 --> 06:29.254

to fix that pipe.

Don't worry, pups, we'll help
Farmer Al as quick as we can,

06:57.384 --> 06:58.550
and then race over to the show.

06:58.552 --> 07:04.189
And if I'm late, there's another
pup who could lead the band.

07:04.191 --> 07:05.223

11:32.959 --> 11:34.559
¶ Everybody yip ¶

11:34.561 --> 11:36.327
¶ Yip-yip! ¶

11:36.329 --> 11:38.463
¶ Put your paws up,
put 'em up now ¶

11:38.465 --> 11:40.632
¶ Let me hear your pup howl ¶

11:40.634 --> 11:43.568
(Cheering)

11:56.516 --> 11:58.249
Cool!

11:58.251 --> 11:59.951
Okay, Rubble, we're almost done.

11:59.953 --> 12:02.754
For the next part
of the corn maze,

12:02.756 --> 12:05.290
you need to turn... that way.

12:05.292 --> 12:06.624
Woof! Woof!

12:10.897 --> 12:13.531
We should be plowing
through the exit soon.

12:13.533 --> 12:17.435
Hey, Rubble, what do little
corn cobs call their daddy?

12:17.437 --> 12:18.403
What?

12:18.405 --> 12:19.704
Pop-corn.

12:19.706 --> 12:21.439
(Laughing)

12:21.441 --> 12:22.674
I get it!

12:22.676 --> 12:24.476
(Laughing)

12:27.247 --> 12:28.379
BOTH:
We did it!

12:28.381 --> 12:30.014
Yes! The maze is done.

12:30.016 --> 12:33.017
And it's amazing!

12:33.019 --> 12:34.185
(Laughing)

12:34.187 --> 12:37.021
And now we've got lots
and lots of corn to roast.

12:37.023 --> 12:40.859
But first we have lots
and lots of shucking to do.

12:40.861 --> 12:42.727
BOTH:
Aw, shucks.

12:42.729 --> 12:43.862
Huh?

12:43.864 --> 12:44.996
(Laughing)

12:44.998 --> 12:47.232
Let's get shucking.

12:49.369 --> 12:51.803
Another piled of shucked corn,
Farmer Al.

12:51.805 --> 12:55.306
Thanks, Pups. I never could've
gotten everything ready

12:55.308 --> 12:56.407
without your help.

12:56.409 --> 12:58.209
You can go clean up
and get ready.

12:58.211 --> 13:00.879
Clean up? Us? Why?

13:00.881 --> 13:05.316
We have more dirt and husks on
us than Farmer Al's field!

13:05.318 --> 13:07.318
Come on, let's go.

13:07.320 --> 13:09.821
(Barking)

13:09.823 --> 13:11.156
(Popping)

13:11.158 --> 13:14.692
Easy, girl, it's just
some corn popping.

13:14.694 --> 13:15.927
(Popping)

13:18.665 --> 13:22.734
I can't wait to have some of
Farmer Al's grilled corn.

13:22.736 --> 13:25.603
I can't wait to race
through the corn maze.

13:25.605 --> 13:27.071
And I can't wait to show Skye

13:27.073 --> 13:30.475
the dance moves I've been
practicing for the hoedown.

13:30.477 --> 13:33.378
Well, howdy, partner!

13:33.380 --> 13:34.245
Partner?

13:34.247 --> 13:36.147
(Barking)
(Laughing)

13:36.149 --> 13:39.184
You two look like
a couple of corn dogs.

13:39.186 --> 13:39.818
(Laughing)

13:39.820 --> 13:42.320
Yeah, yeah, we know.
Where's Skye?

13:42.322 --> 13:44.756
Practicing for the hoedown.

13:44.758 --> 13:47.325
Circle right...

13:47.327 --> 13:49.160
and left...

13:49.162 --> 13:51.162
and promenade!

13:51.164 --> 13:53.064
And back flip!

13:53.066 --> 13:55.466
Okay, I made the last move up.

13:55.468 --> 13:57.569
(Laughing)

13:58.939 --> 14:00.638
(Sizzling)

14:00.640 --> 14:02.106
Oh, smell that, Chickaletta?

14:02.108 --> 14:06.611
The only think Chickaletta likes
better than corn is grilled corn

14:06.613 --> 14:09.681
and the only thing she likes
better than grilled corn

14:09.683 --> 14:11.249
is a corn maze!

14:11.251 --> 14:15.420
And that's the most
amazing corn maze yet!

14:15.422 --> 14:19.791
Thanks, Mayor Goodway.
Now it's time to get grilling.

14:19.793 --> 14:21.726
(Popping)

14:21.728 --> 14:23.161
(Mooing)

14:23.163 --> 14:26.164
Whoa!
Aah!

14:30.871 --> 14:32.136
Uh-oh!
Oh, my!

14:32.138 --> 14:34.172
The hot coals
spilled everywhere.

14:34.174 --> 14:35.607
Call the PAW Patrol.

14:35.609 --> 14:37.175
I'm on it!

14:37.177 --> 14:38.443
(Video game sounds)

14:38.445 --> 14:39.811
(Phone ringing)

14:39.813 --> 14:40.545
Hey, Farmer Al.

14:40.547 --> 14:43.014
We're getting ready to head over
to the corn roast.

14:43.016 --> 14:44.582
<i> I need the PAW Patrol, quick!</i>

14:44.584 --> 14:45.283
What's wrong?

14:45.285 --> 14:47.151
<i> Bettina knocked over</i>
<i> the barbeque.</i>

14:47.153 --> 14:48.987
<i> Hot coals fell</i>
<i> on the piles of corn,</i>

14:48.989 --> 14:51.089
<i> and they're starting</i>
<i> to smoke and smolder.</i>

14:51.091 --> 14:52.557
<i> I need the PAW Patrol</i>
<i> to help out</i>

14:52.559 --> 14:55.360
<i> before the corn roast</i>
<i> turns into a bonfire!</i>

14:55.362 --> 14:56.561
Don't worry, Farmer Al.

14:56.563 --> 15:00.298
No job is too big,
no pup is too small.

15:01.234 --> 15:03.568
PAW Patrol, to the lookout!

15:03.570 --> 15:05.937
ALL:
Ryder needs us!

15:05.939 --> 15:08.506
Uh-oh.

15:08.508 --> 15:11.609
Whoa!

15:11.611 --> 15:14.045
(Barking)

15:14.047 --> 15:16.481
Wait for me!

15:20.153 --> 15:21.486
Sorry!

15:21.488 --> 15:22.954
But-- huh?

15:22.956 --> 15:24.555
Whoa! Nice hat.

15:24.557 --> 15:26.391
Yeah, yeah, I know...

15:26.393 --> 15:29.594
(Laughing)

15:44.244 --> 15:48.546
PAW Patrol, ready
for action, Ryder, sir!

15:48.548 --> 15:50.114
Thanks for hurrying over, pups.

15:50.116 --> 15:54.018
Farmer Al's barbeque fell
and spilled its coals.

15:54.020 --> 15:58.489
We have to put them out
before anything catches fire.

15:58.491 --> 16:01.092
Marshall, I need you
and your water cannons

16:01.094 --> 16:02.927
to put out the hot coals.

16:02.929 --> 16:04.996
I'm fired up!

16:04.998 --> 16:08.232
Rubble, I need you to scoop up
the dried husks and corn

16:08.234 --> 16:10.635
and move them away
from the cookout area.

16:10.637 --> 16:12.503
Rubble on the double!

16:12.505 --> 16:15.273
The rest of you can head out
to the corn roast.

16:15.275 --> 16:16.741

Yee-haw!

scattered all over.

17:30.250 --> 17:33.518
We have to put 'em out before we
can start the corn roast.

17:43.596 --> 17:45.229
(Popping)
Whoa!

17:45.231 --> 17:49.667
Hey, I like my popcorn
on my mouth, not on my nose!

17:50.670 --> 17:51.969
Mm! That's better.

17:51.971 --> 17:55.573
Popcorn? We'd better
take a closer look.

17:55.909 --> 17:58.543
Whoa! The coals under
this pile of corn

17:58.545 --> 18:01.012
heated them so much,
they're popping!

18:01.014 --> 18:04.315
That's not good.
Marshall, let's cool 'em down.

18:04.317 --> 18:06.284
I'm on it! Arf-arf!

18:06.286 --> 18:09.654
Water spray!

18:09.656 --> 18:11.089
Great!

18:17.363 --> 18:19.997
Arf-arf!

18:19.999 --> 18:22.366
(Popping)
And more!

18:22.368 --> 18:24.001
(Barking)

18:24.003 --> 18:26.471
(Loud popping sound)

18:26.473 --> 18:28.673

18:28.675 --> 18:29.474
Whew!

18:29.476 --> 18:33.978
I'm up to my "ears" in corn!

18:33.980 --> 18:34.846

18:37.217 --> 18:39.217
Chickaletta, Chickaletta!

18:39.219 --> 18:43.788
Oh, Ryder, Chickaletta's lost
in the popcorn field maze!

18:43.790 --> 18:44.856
You have to find her.

18:44.858 --> 18:48.192
It's all right, Mayor.
We'll find Chickaletta.

18:49.829 --> 18:50.761
(Beeping)

18:50.763 --> 18:51.496
Chase here!

18:51.498 --> 18:53.931
Chase, Chickaletta's
lost in the corn maze.

18:53.933 --> 18:56.033
I need your spy drone
and heat vision goggles

18:56.035 --> 19:00.037
to see if you can spot her
before she's buried in popcorn.

19:00.039 --> 19:00.771
Popcorn?

19:00.773 --> 19:03.107
You'll see when
you get here.

19:03.109 --> 19:05.343
Chase is on the case!

19:05.345 --> 19:07.578
(Barking)

19:09.849 --> 19:12.116
This pile of popcorn
is still smoldering?

19:12.118 --> 19:15.453
There must still be
a hot coal in there.

19:15.455 --> 19:17.155
Clear the road!

19:19.259 --> 19:20.057
Thanks, Rubble!

19:20.059 --> 19:22.760
I never could've eaten my way
through all that

19:22.762 --> 19:25.730
without a movie... or two!

19:25.732 --> 19:28.966
There it is! Arf-arf! Spray!

19:31.304 --> 19:33.504
(Sirens)

19:36.242 --> 19:37.608
So worried about Chickaletta.

19:37.610 --> 19:40.478
Whenever she eats too much
popcorn, she gets gassy.

19:40.480 --> 19:42.980
Don't worry, Mayor,
we'll find her.

19:42.982 --> 19:43.814
Chase?

19:43.816 --> 19:46.517
I'm on it! Drone!

19:48.555 --> 19:50.955
Deploy!

19:54.227 --> 19:56.194
Oh! Oh!

19:56.196 --> 19:58.796
Uh, find that chicken!

20:00.567 --> 20:05.870
Nothing but popcorn.
Lots of popcorn.

20:09.275 --> 20:10.374
I see her!

20:10.376 --> 20:13.911
Oh, hurray!

20:13.913 --> 20:17.215
Uh-oh, the drone lost track of
Chickaletta.

20:17.217 --> 20:18.115
Oh, no!

20:18.117 --> 20:18.916
You'd better go in

20:18.918 --> 20:21.852
and use your heat-vision goggles
to try and find her, Chase.

20:21.854 --> 20:23.754
Chase is on the case!

20:23.756 --> 20:25.723
(Barking)

20:29.195 --> 20:32.630
Hmm. I wonder which pile.

20:32.632 --> 20:35.199
Ruff! Heat-vision goggles!

20:38.104 --> 20:42.406
Gotcha! I'm going in!

20:43.509 --> 20:44.475
(Howling)

20:44.477 --> 20:45.343
Found her!

20:45.345 --> 20:47.011

Great work, Chase!

20:47.013 --> 20:48.012
(Clucking)

20:48.014 --> 20:50.047
Uh-oh...
Achoo!

20:50.049 --> 20:51.549
And her feathers.

20:51.551 --> 20:52.650
Don't lose her, Chase.

20:52.652 --> 20:56.721
I won't. Come on, Chickaletta.
Follow me!

20:56.723 --> 20:57.722

20:57.724 --> 21:00.157
<i> Hang on, we'll be right out!</i>

21:09.402 --> 21:11.769

fluttered your tummy.

21:15.408 --> 21:16.941
Yes... well...

21:16.943 --> 21:18.943
(Laughing)

21:18.945 --> 21:21.579
Wait for Mama!

21:21.581 --> 21:23.614
Ryder, the corn roast is ruined.

21:23.616 --> 21:27.685
All the roasting corn popped,
and filled the maze.

21:27.687 --> 21:29.420
Hmm... I've got it!

21:29.422 --> 21:32.723
Farmer Al, what do you think of
having a corn maze

21:32.725 --> 21:35.393
and a popcorn festival?

21:35.395 --> 21:36.560
Oh, great idea!

21:36.562 --> 21:39.130
Okay, Rubble and use
the shovel on his truck

21:39.132 --> 21:43.200
to collect all the popcorn piles
and the rest of us will bag it.

21:43.202 --> 21:46.470
(Cheering)

21:48.207 --> 21:52.009
The popcorn is bagged and the
maze is all cleared out again.

21:52.011 --> 21:54.979
And coals are all out.
No more smoke.

21:54.981 --> 21:57.348
Thanks, pups! Thanks, Ryder!

21:57.350 --> 21:58.182
You're welcome, Farmer Al.

21:58.184 --> 22:02.186

popped, just yelp for help.

22:02.188 --> 22:03.821

22:03.823 --> 22:06.757
Can we finally dig into
some popcorn?

22:06.759 --> 22:08.759
Dig in and eat it, I mean.

22:08.761 --> 22:12.930
Sure you can.
You're all such good pups.

22:15.435 --> 22:18.436
