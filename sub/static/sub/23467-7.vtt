FX presents Baskets.

00:15.716 --> 00:17.785
MAN: Get on with it!

00:19.720 --> 00:21.355
DALE:
My mom opened a rodeo.

00:21.389 --> 00:24.525
-She's spending a lot of money
on shit we don't need. -Dad.

00:24.558 --> 00:26.060
My back. Oh...

00:26.094 --> 00:27.328
You're getting sued,
Mom, I'm suing you.

00:27.361 --> 00:29.897
MRS. BASKETS:
You can't be serious.

00:29.930 --> 00:31.999
Why are you wearing
this costume?

00:32.032 --> 00:33.501
This is my French clown outfit.

00:33.534 --> 00:34.935
You're not a French cloon.

00:40.208 --> 00:42.210
(phone ringing,
printer whirring)

00:44.745 --> 00:46.380
I'm sorry about
your collision, sir,

00:46.414 --> 00:48.216
but we don't cover glass eyes.

00:48.249 --> 00:49.750
They're considered accessories.

00:49.783 --> 00:51.752
-Martha!
-Oh, my God.

00:51.785 --> 00:53.387
-Hold on, sir.
-It's Christine.

00:53.421 --> 00:54.955
Mrs. Baskets, you scared me.

00:54.988 --> 00:57.024
We're going to Vegas.

00:57.057 --> 00:58.226
You and Chip?

00:58.259 --> 00:59.460
No, you and me.

00:59.493 --> 01:01.429
A girls' weekend.

01:01.462 --> 01:04.265
We're going
to a businesswoman's conference.

01:04.298 --> 01:06.534
Lori Greiner's gonna be there,
from Shark Tank.

01:06.567 --> 01:09.737
She's a real business leader.

01:09.770 --> 01:11.605
-Well, she...
-Anyways, I got us

01:11.639 --> 01:12.640
a two-for-one package.

01:12.673 --> 01:14.074
You're going, I'm going.

01:14.108 --> 01:16.144
We get a free tote.

01:16.177 --> 01:18.279
We're businesswomen, aren't we?

01:18.312 --> 01:20.080
Well...

01:20.114 --> 01:22.783
So, what's fun to do in Vegas?

01:22.816 --> 01:24.385
You know, I could always
clear up a weekend

01:24.418 --> 01:25.586
and show you around.

01:25.619 --> 01:28.156
It's a woman's weekend, Ken.

01:28.189 --> 01:30.991
You know, enough men have been
telling me what to do.

01:31.024 --> 01:32.793
My brother Jim.

01:32.826 --> 01:34.962
Dale is suing me.

01:34.995 --> 01:36.630
-Chip was mad at me.

01:36.664 --> 01:38.732
You said, wha...
Dale is suing you?

01:38.766 --> 01:41.335
-Did you ever have any of your
kids sue you, Ken? -No.

01:41.369 --> 01:42.803
It's awful that he's suing you.

01:42.836 --> 01:44.438
I wish I could talk
to his little ass.

01:44.472 --> 01:45.839
There's no talking to him, Ken.

01:45.873 --> 01:47.975
I've been through this.

01:48.008 --> 01:49.109
Hey, what's the name
of that steakhouse

01:49.143 --> 01:51.078
you like so much there in Vegas?

01:51.111 --> 01:53.181
Oh, the Outback.

01:53.214 --> 01:56.016
MRS. BASKETS: You know, Martha,
this is gonna be a hoot.

01:56.049 --> 01:58.486
That's what you guys say
in the sticks, don't you?

01:58.519 --> 02:01.522
MARTHA:
Um, I guess.

02:01.555 --> 02:04.458
Steak fries, yes--
well done, please--

02:04.492 --> 02:08.462
and, uh, oh, a piña--
virgin-- piña colada.

02:08.496 --> 02:10.331
Yeah-- Martha,
you want a colada?

02:10.364 --> 02:11.499
Oh, no, thanks.

02:11.532 --> 02:12.633
I have a canker sore.

02:12.666 --> 02:14.368
-Oh, just one.
-Thank you, sir.

02:14.402 --> 02:18.005
You know... Hey, will we get
the USA Today tomorrow?

02:18.038 --> 02:19.640
Oh, damn it.

02:19.673 --> 02:21.709
Never mind. I'm sorry, Dinah.

02:21.742 --> 02:23.611
Yeah, just one colada.

02:23.644 --> 02:25.713
Thanks a lot.
Oh, she's nice.

02:25.746 --> 02:27.981
Hey, Martha, I almost forgot
to give you this.

02:28.015 --> 02:30.951
Your lanyard and your tote.

02:30.984 --> 02:32.186
Thanks, Mrs. Baskets.

02:32.220 --> 02:33.454
Yeah.

02:33.487 --> 02:35.055
You know what? I'll fill it up

02:35.088 --> 02:37.891
with hygiene products
and give it to a homeless lady.

02:37.925 --> 02:41.128
No, Martha, that's your tote
for the seminar.

02:41.161 --> 02:44.031
You put all your seminar package
stuff in there.

02:44.064 --> 02:45.833
I wouldn't even
carry your purse.

02:45.866 --> 02:48.135
I'd consolidate it
and just carry the tote.

02:48.168 --> 02:51.071
I think I'll just use it
like an extra bag, as intended,

02:51.104 --> 02:52.473
but thank you.

02:52.506 --> 02:53.741
Martha, what if
you get bogged down?

02:53.774 --> 02:55.142
You'll be sorry.

02:55.175 --> 02:56.844
I'll be okay, but thanks.

02:56.877 --> 02:58.846
Okay, to each his own.

03:06.554 --> 03:09.690
Hello?

03:09.723 --> 03:11.225
Hello?!

03:11.259 --> 03:12.393
Good.

03:12.426 --> 03:14.528
Okay.

03:20.434 --> 03:22.570
Gatorades is mine.

03:22.603 --> 03:25.038
All four of 'em.

03:25.072 --> 03:26.707
This is mine.

03:26.740 --> 03:29.343
These is mine.

03:29.377 --> 03:31.245
What are you doing?

03:31.279 --> 03:33.614
I'm taking what's mine.

03:33.647 --> 03:35.082
I reinjured my back

03:35.115 --> 03:37.084
dealing with a broken pipe
on Thanksgiving,

03:37.117 --> 03:39.186
over at the rodeo,
when Mom bailed on me.

03:39.219 --> 03:41.188
This cinnamon's mine.

03:41.221 --> 03:43.090
Jellybeans are mine.

03:43.123 --> 03:45.459
Now I have a bulging disc

03:45.493 --> 03:48.128
between my L4 and my L5
on my spinal cord.

03:48.161 --> 03:50.598
Right on my lumbar vertebrae.

03:50.631 --> 03:53.233
And I got this surgeon, who
comes highly recommended on Yelp

03:53.267 --> 03:55.469
and some bus stations,
and he says that I need surgery,

03:55.503 --> 03:57.505
so...

03:59.440 --> 04:01.975
What does this have to do
with you taking stuff?

04:02.009 --> 04:04.745
Well, my surgery's gonna be
very expensive,

04:04.778 --> 04:08.416
and Mom maxed out
my credit card, so it's...

04:08.449 --> 04:11.251
it's payback time. You know?

04:11.285 --> 04:13.387
Need to... I'll take this.

04:13.421 --> 04:15.889
Where's my Bonnie Raitt CD?

04:15.923 --> 04:18.158
There it is. Where is Mama?

04:18.191 --> 04:20.260
'Cause I need to know
how much time I have to loot.

04:20.294 --> 04:21.595
I don't really need
to take that.

04:21.629 --> 04:23.631
She's in, uh, Vegas,
with Martha,

04:23.664 --> 04:25.098
at a woman's conference.

04:25.132 --> 04:27.335
Ah, Vegas.
Well, I tell you one thing.

04:27.368 --> 04:29.637
The rodeo won't be paying
for that, that's for sure.

04:29.670 --> 04:31.972
Oh, all right.

04:32.005 --> 04:33.641
I'll be in the shower.

04:33.674 --> 04:34.642
I'll take this lamp.

04:34.675 --> 04:35.676
I'll just...

04:35.709 --> 04:37.110
-Ah...

04:37.144 --> 04:38.278
My back.

04:40.981 --> 04:42.850
Martha, can you put this
in your tote?

04:42.883 --> 04:44.251
Mine's full of bric-a-brac.

04:44.284 --> 04:46.654
-I am.

04:46.687 --> 04:49.089
Ooh, soft-boiled eggs.

04:49.122 --> 04:51.859
Excuse me, ladies,
I've got to hit the buffet.

04:51.892 --> 04:54.928
So, anyway, I own a rodeo.

04:54.962 --> 04:56.964
It's smelly, but I love it.

04:56.997 --> 04:58.198
-Ooh.

04:58.231 --> 04:59.600
I try to make it more beautiful,

04:59.633 --> 05:02.035
but people don't seem
to really care.

05:02.069 --> 05:04.104
My sons also work there,

05:04.137 --> 05:06.707
and they think
they know more than me, so...

05:06.740 --> 05:08.976
What do you ladies do?

05:09.009 --> 05:11.311
Well, I own a hair salon
in Phoenix.

05:11.345 --> 05:13.781
-The Hipster Snipster.
-Ah!

05:13.814 --> 05:16.850
Dee Dee's got Scissor Barn
and Kiki's got Cut and Dry.

05:16.884 --> 05:18.352
Oh, cute names.

05:18.386 --> 05:19.853
And you own a salon?

05:19.887 --> 05:21.855
Oh, no, actually,
I'm the CEO and owner

05:21.889 --> 05:23.891
of Chin Chan's Chinese Bistro.

05:23.924 --> 05:25.726
Chin Chan's?

05:25.759 --> 05:27.961
Martha, the Chin Chan lady!

05:27.995 --> 05:29.397
Oh, hi.

05:29.430 --> 05:31.832
I'm obsessed
with your fortune cookies.

05:31.865 --> 05:34.134
-Thank you.
-Oh.

05:34.167 --> 05:36.570
They must kill you
on the refills, huh?

05:36.604 --> 05:38.739
You know, that's what
keeps them coming back.

05:38.772 --> 05:40.408
So smart.

05:40.441 --> 05:41.709
That, and the lo mein.

05:44.512 --> 05:46.847
Lo mein.

05:46.880 --> 05:49.550
Good insights, gentlemen.
And that is what it's like

05:49.583 --> 05:52.252
to be a woman
in today's business world.

05:54.054 --> 05:57.591
Oh! Worth every damn penny.

05:57.625 --> 05:59.893
MRS. BASKETS:
Ooh, samples.

05:59.927 --> 06:01.895
Little early.

06:01.929 --> 06:04.231
Wine, Martha.

06:04.264 --> 06:05.499
Zinfandel.

06:05.533 --> 06:08.402
That looks a little healthy
for me.

06:08.436 --> 06:11.672
Oh, I don't know how they do
a massage in public.

06:11.705 --> 06:14.675
I won't even do one in private.

06:14.708 --> 06:16.444
Do you like massages, Martha?

06:16.477 --> 06:19.447
I don't really like
to be touched by strangers.

06:19.480 --> 06:21.381
Hmm.

06:21.415 --> 06:23.083
-Oh, look at those flowers.
-SANDRA: Oh, Christine.

06:23.116 --> 06:26.420
-Christine, there you are.
-Chin Chan! The Chin Chan lady.

06:26.454 --> 06:29.289
We were just talking about going
to the strip club.

06:29.322 --> 06:32.025
We go every year.
Do you want to come with us?

06:32.059 --> 06:35.596
There are gonna be
free refills on men.

06:35.629 --> 06:36.897
-Oh! With men...

06:36.930 --> 06:38.466
:
Oh.

06:38.499 --> 06:40.868
-Well, yeah, I guess.
-Yeah.

06:40.901 --> 06:42.269
-Awesome.
-I don't know.

06:42.302 --> 06:44.572
I'm pretty tired,
and my feet hurt.

06:44.605 --> 06:46.273
Oh, does your lap hurt?

06:46.306 --> 06:48.976
Because it is going to.

06:50.177 --> 06:52.713
Count us in.

06:52.746 --> 06:53.781
-Yes. Awesome.
-I don't...

06:53.814 --> 06:55.883
You can bow out later.

07:01.489 --> 07:02.656
Oh!

07:05.593 --> 07:07.761
Hey! Dale!

07:07.795 --> 07:09.262
-Whoa!

07:09.296 --> 07:10.564
What are you doing?

07:10.598 --> 07:12.500
I'm taking what is mine!

07:12.533 --> 07:15.002
You know your mother's very
upset that you're suing her.

07:15.035 --> 07:16.403
Oh, yeah, uh, guess what.

07:16.436 --> 07:18.806
Ow, my back.
Yeah, I'm upset, too.

07:18.839 --> 07:20.641
-I'm up...

07:20.674 --> 07:22.075
Are you taking
the treadmill, too?

07:22.109 --> 07:24.578
-Hey, Ken.
-Chip.

07:24.612 --> 07:27.615
Yeah, uh, you're stealing
Christine's treadmill?

07:27.648 --> 07:30.751
It's called collateral,
for my impending back surgery.

07:31.852 --> 07:34.287
Don't Carpet King me, Ken.

07:34.321 --> 07:36.524
We're not in Colorado.

07:36.557 --> 07:39.292
Hey, Chip? Can you get
your phone out, please?

07:39.326 --> 07:42.162
I'm gonna need
two angles on this.

07:42.195 --> 07:44.197
My phone doesn't do video.

07:45.232 --> 07:47.200
Look, your mother just wants you

07:47.234 --> 07:49.302
to drop the lawsuit.

07:49.336 --> 07:51.639
Don't gaslight me...
Let me put this on me.

07:51.672 --> 07:53.974
Don't gaslight me, Ken.

07:54.007 --> 07:56.109
You know, you didn't even
put a ring on it.

07:56.143 --> 07:58.378
So this is really
none of your beeswax.

07:58.411 --> 08:01.882
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have a treadmill to move.

08:04.251 --> 08:07.888
Don't die on me, Dale.

08:07.921 --> 08:09.890
Don't die on me.

08:18.666 --> 08:20.300
Oh!

08:20.333 --> 08:24.137
I wish I had some ones.

08:24.171 --> 08:27.140
Ladies and... gentlewomen,

08:27.174 --> 08:31.311
one special lady will get
her very own strip show.

08:31.344 --> 08:33.413
Can Martha Brooks
please come to the stage?

08:33.446 --> 08:34.882
-Martha!

08:34.915 --> 08:37.384
-I signed you up.

08:37.417 --> 08:39.486
I thought you wanted
to live a little.

08:39.519 --> 08:40.988
I never said that.

08:41.021 --> 08:44.191
Well, you should.
Live a little, let it go.

08:44.224 --> 08:45.993
-Li... Well, live a little...

08:46.026 --> 08:48.228
-Yeah.
-Mrs. Baskets...

08:48.261 --> 08:49.897
Go have some fun, Martha,
it's all in fun.

08:49.930 --> 08:53.000
-I... this isn't... fun.
-I'm right here, Martha.

08:53.033 --> 08:55.836
If they try any hanky-panky,
I'll be right up there.

09:01.775 --> 09:04.945
Oh! They've called
the fire department.

09:07.480 --> 09:09.917
* I'm saucy, I'm drippin' *

09:09.950 --> 09:12.419
* I'm tasty, delicious *

09:12.452 --> 09:15.022
* Yeah, I'm fresh head to toe
when I step in the spot... *

09:15.055 --> 09:17.891
Oh, okay, I...

09:17.925 --> 09:20.093
Martha, go along with it.

09:20.127 --> 09:22.095
I think it's a bad idea.

09:22.129 --> 09:23.463
-* I'm sau... *

09:23.496 --> 09:25.065
-MRS. BASKETS: Aah!

09:25.098 --> 09:26.767
Martha!

09:32.072 --> 09:34.141
I thought we had a minibar.

09:34.174 --> 09:36.143
This cupboard is bare.

09:36.176 --> 09:38.979
Old Mother Hubbard.
There's nothing the cupboard.

09:39.012 --> 09:41.481
Excuse me, can I get through?

09:41.514 --> 09:43.283
Oh!
Yeah, sure.

09:43.316 --> 09:44.952
Sorry.

09:44.985 --> 09:47.454
I should have told you,
Mrs. Baskets,

09:47.487 --> 09:50.290
I just can't go to these
types of things.

09:50.323 --> 09:51.759
You know, I don't know
if you've noticed,

09:51.792 --> 09:53.794
but I've been giving you
the silent treatment.

09:53.827 --> 09:54.795
What?

09:54.828 --> 09:57.430
No, I didn't notice it.

09:57.464 --> 10:00.467
-Huh. Here, let me help you
with this. -I got it.

10:00.500 --> 10:01.935
How about your pillow?
I could plop that up,

10:01.969 --> 10:03.470
-I don't need it... Ow.

10:03.503 --> 10:07.307
Oh! I'm sorry.
Listen, let me get you some ice.

10:16.684 --> 10:19.486
Lori Greiner? Oh!

10:19.519 --> 10:22.589
My friend Martha's
never gonna believe this.

10:22.622 --> 10:25.793
Lori, oh, God.

10:25.826 --> 10:29.129
Oh, God.
I'm Christine Baskets.

10:29.162 --> 10:31.331
Sorry.
It's Christine Baskets.

10:31.364 --> 10:33.000
-This is just like a...
-Nice to meet you.

10:33.033 --> 10:35.268
-Thank you.
-I'm just getting some ice.

10:35.302 --> 10:38.605
-I have a sore neck from my
flight. -Oh, I'm sorry.

10:38.638 --> 10:40.373
I get a sore neck myself.

10:40.407 --> 10:42.609
-We're twins.

10:42.642 --> 10:46.279
Ah! Martha!

10:46.313 --> 10:48.648
I met Lori Greiner!

10:48.682 --> 10:52.019
It's a Las Vegas miracle!

10:52.052 --> 10:54.054
She was so nice.

10:54.087 --> 10:55.956
I got to call Ken.

10:55.989 --> 10:58.058
Okay, well, I'm trying to sleep.

10:58.091 --> 11:00.060
KEN: Well, that's-that's
nice, Christine.

11:00.093 --> 11:03.630
It sounds like you're having
a really good time.

11:03.663 --> 11:07.000
Listen, uh, I don't want
to upset you, but, uh...

11:07.034 --> 11:08.468
Oh, is it the strippers?

11:08.501 --> 11:11.171
-Oh, I don't care about them.
-No, no.

11:11.204 --> 11:14.708
Well... I just talked to Dale.

11:14.742 --> 11:16.243
Well, I came down here
to talk to him

11:16.276 --> 11:18.145
about dropping the lawsuit.

11:18.178 --> 11:19.747
You're in Bakersfield?

11:19.780 --> 11:22.015
You didn't have to do that.

11:22.049 --> 11:26.486
I know, but I think
I just made things worse.

11:26.519 --> 11:28.555
Well, I'll just deal with Dale
when I get back.

11:28.588 --> 11:30.323
That's what I'm here for,
isn't it,

11:30.357 --> 11:33.026
to learn how to deal with
the business end of things?

11:33.060 --> 11:35.929
I know, I'll talk
to Lori Greiner

11:35.963 --> 11:39.099
during my meet and greet
about how to deal with Dale.

11:39.132 --> 11:42.936
Oh... thank you.

11:42.970 --> 11:46.106
Thank you.
Oh, my gosh.

11:46.139 --> 11:47.440
-Lori!
-Thank you, ladies.

11:47.474 --> 11:48.876
-I think she saw me.
-Thank you.

11:48.909 --> 11:51.411
Can we sit down now?
My knee is on fire.

11:51.444 --> 11:53.413
LORI:
Thank you.

11:53.446 --> 11:57.384
Today, we are going to get
true financial freedom.

11:57.417 --> 11:58.718
You know how?

11:58.752 --> 12:00.921
We're gonna cut up
our credit cards.

12:00.954 --> 12:02.956
Get 'em out, ladies.

12:02.990 --> 12:06.593
Oh, my credit card,
I'd love to cut that up.

12:06.626 --> 12:09.897
Oh, no, my purse.
I lost my purse, Mrs. Baskets.

12:09.930 --> 12:12.866
-My purse.

12:12.900 --> 12:15.302
I'm not used to having more
than one thing on my shoulder.

12:15.335 --> 12:17.604
That tote really threw me off.

12:17.637 --> 12:20.473
Well, you know,
we talked about this.

12:20.507 --> 12:23.010
You got bogged down,
you didn't consolidate.

12:25.012 --> 12:28.215
Oh, I must have left it
at the strip club.

12:28.248 --> 12:30.217
It must have fallen
off the stage

12:30.250 --> 12:31.985
when I fell off the stage.

12:32.019 --> 12:34.121
We'll get it afterwards.

12:34.154 --> 12:35.989
I've got a meet and greet
with Lori next.

12:36.023 --> 12:38.091
No, I can't wait till later.

12:38.125 --> 12:40.327
If it's gone, the first 48 hours

12:40.360 --> 12:42.595
after a crime are
the most important.

12:42.629 --> 12:44.764
Martha, you're acting
so frazzled.

12:44.798 --> 12:46.633
I've never seen you like this.

12:46.666 --> 12:48.168
Well, I told you
I didn't want to go,

12:48.201 --> 12:49.636
and you wouldn't listen to me.

12:49.669 --> 12:51.738
And then you had that stripper
grind on me.

12:51.771 --> 12:53.773
I get it.

12:53.807 --> 12:57.610
You want an apology.
I'm sorry.

12:57.644 --> 12:59.612
I just wanted you
to have a little fun.

12:59.646 --> 13:01.849
-Mrs. Baskets,

13:01.882 --> 13:03.783
you think everyone's
like you, and we're not.

13:03.817 --> 13:05.618
Okay, some of us are
more sensitive,

13:05.652 --> 13:07.654
like me and like Dale.

13:07.687 --> 13:10.490
You know, he was just trying
to help you with your budget,

13:10.523 --> 13:12.092
and you wouldn't listen to him,

13:12.125 --> 13:14.527
and that's why he's suing you.

13:14.561 --> 13:16.864
I think that you're
a great businesswoman,

13:16.897 --> 13:20.267
but you could maybe be a little
bit better of a listener.

13:20.300 --> 13:22.202
I have to go get my purse.

13:22.235 --> 13:26.673
LORI: And made me feel good,
so I just started making more.

13:26.706 --> 13:30.477
Thank you.
Thank you.

13:42.155 --> 13:43.891
Hi, Ken.

13:43.924 --> 13:46.159
Oh, I haven't been wearing this
since you left.

13:46.193 --> 13:48.228
I've just been working
on some clown routines.

13:48.261 --> 13:51.064
It's very freeing,
so that's why I have it on.

13:51.098 --> 13:53.833
Is Dale here?

13:53.867 --> 13:55.735
No, he doesn't live here
any longer.

13:55.768 --> 13:58.071
You know where he's staying?

13:58.105 --> 14:00.507
I can take you to him.
Let me get my keys.

14:00.540 --> 14:02.142
How you been?

14:02.175 --> 14:03.743
KEN:
Oh, fine. How

14:03.776 --> 14:05.212
CHIP:
You know...

14:05.245 --> 14:08.982
I'm kind of rebranding
myself a little bit.

14:09.016 --> 14:12.185
We just had a barbecue funeral
for my old clown Renoir.

14:12.219 --> 14:15.889
-Ah. -So I just don't know
what's gonna be next.

14:15.923 --> 14:17.925
-Yeah. -You know,
nothing's clicking.

14:17.958 --> 14:20.727
Yeah, I hear you. I...

14:20.760 --> 14:22.395
You know, I went through
a lot of that stuff myself.

14:22.429 --> 14:24.898
I mean, you see me now,
I'm the Carpet King,

14:24.932 --> 14:28.101
but I went through
a lot of levels, iterations.

14:28.135 --> 14:31.538
I used to be the--
the Carpet Gnome,

14:31.571 --> 14:32.940
the Carpetbagger.

14:32.973 --> 14:35.375
I was the Carpet Brother.

14:35.408 --> 14:37.377
So, you know. I mean,
you-you-you go through that

14:37.410 --> 14:40.413
until you find
that-that-that character,

14:40.447 --> 14:43.917
that-that sweet spot.

14:43.951 --> 14:45.718
Say, how-how do I get
to your brother Dale?

14:45.752 --> 14:47.520
Give me some tips.

14:47.554 --> 14:49.522
Um...

14:49.556 --> 14:54.061
Well, Dale likes to win, right?

14:54.094 --> 14:57.097
So as long as he thinks
he's winning,

14:57.130 --> 15:00.200
then you don't have
any problems with him.

15:00.233 --> 15:02.635
I can do that.

15:08.341 --> 15:11.711
I'll take the 90-minute
hot stones massage.

15:11.744 --> 15:13.981
It's for Lori Greiner.

15:14.014 --> 15:16.950
Her neck is sore
from her flight.

15:16.984 --> 15:19.919
She's got everyday people
problems, just like us.

15:19.953 --> 15:22.755
Thank you.

15:22.789 --> 15:24.624
Oh, it's so light.

15:24.657 --> 15:28.395
Are the stones in here,
or does she pick them up?

15:28.428 --> 15:31.098
Okay. Thank you.

15:32.132 --> 15:33.333
LORI:
Hi.

15:33.366 --> 15:36.269
Nice to meet you.

15:36.303 --> 15:39.272
Hi. Nice to meet you.

15:39.306 --> 15:42.109
Lori, I met you
at the ice machine.

15:42.142 --> 15:43.676
Oh, yeah.

15:43.710 --> 15:44.978
Yeah.

15:45.012 --> 15:47.280
-My family has this rodeo.
-Uh-huh.

15:47.314 --> 15:49.616
And then I-I...
My son need... Hey,

15:49.649 --> 15:52.052
I wanted to talk to Lori.

16:11.638 --> 16:14.041
:
Oh.

16:16.043 --> 16:19.479
This is my first massage.

16:19.512 --> 16:21.714
Are we supposed to talk?

16:21.748 --> 16:23.383
If you want to.

16:23.416 --> 16:25.652
Hmm.

16:25.685 --> 16:28.288
Well, you don't know me, then,
'cause...

16:28.321 --> 16:30.723
if I can talk, I'll do it.

16:30.757 --> 16:34.161
-Oh, God, that feels terrific.

16:34.194 --> 16:36.796
I should really get
my son a massage.

16:36.829 --> 16:39.866
He's got a lower back problem.

16:39.899 --> 16:42.069
Uh, you know, um,
lower back problems

16:42.102 --> 16:44.537
are from financial worries.

16:44.571 --> 16:46.239
Really?

16:46.273 --> 16:49.676
I've got a really good book
on it, actually.

16:49.709 --> 16:52.879
"Healing Back Pain
by John Sarno, M.D.

16:52.912 --> 16:56.716
With a new preface
from the author."

16:56.749 --> 16:59.252
-I love a good preface.
-They sell 'em out in the lobby.

16:59.286 --> 17:00.553
You should buy one for your son.

17:00.587 --> 17:02.889
Sounds like he's under
a lot of stress.

17:02.922 --> 17:07.760
He's suing me.
That's stressful.

17:07.794 --> 17:11.564
Yeah, we have a family business.

17:11.598 --> 17:13.933
A rodeo, if you can believe it.

17:13.966 --> 17:15.768
Wow.

17:15.802 --> 17:19.872
Well... a lot of families
fall apart over money.

17:19.906 --> 17:22.075
That's what happened
to our family.

17:22.109 --> 17:26.546
We had a chain of pharmacies
across the Midwest,

17:26.579 --> 17:28.948
and, um...

17:37.790 --> 17:41.628
I should tell you that, legally,
you are trespassing,

17:41.661 --> 17:44.397
'cause I pay for rent
on this piece of land

17:44.431 --> 17:45.898
on which my van
and my treadmill sit.

17:45.932 --> 17:47.867
-I don't want no trouble.

17:47.900 --> 17:49.369
Well, I think you do,
because ever since I met you,

17:49.402 --> 17:51.704
you've been stirring the pot.

17:51.738 --> 17:55.742
Oh, by the way, I brought
the adapter for the treadmill.

17:58.578 --> 18:02.215
Thank you.
Well, that's nice.

18:02.249 --> 18:04.317
KEN:
You win, Dale.

18:04.351 --> 18:06.986
-The treadmill. It's yours.

18:07.019 --> 18:08.621
I know that.

18:08.655 --> 18:10.923
-Nothing.

18:10.957 --> 18:14.127
I just want you to know that
your mom is working really hard

18:14.161 --> 18:16.496
for the both of you
at the rodeo.

18:16.529 --> 18:18.231
-If you just try to see things

18:18.265 --> 18:20.167
from your mom's point of view,

18:20.200 --> 18:22.802
be a little bit nicer to her.

18:22.835 --> 18:25.838
If you can, I think
you'll see things

18:25.872 --> 18:28.341
from her angle--
see it through her eyes.

18:28.375 --> 18:30.977
Are we cool?

18:31.010 --> 18:32.845
-Cool enough.

18:32.879 --> 18:35.182
I appreciate you
coming out here.

18:35.215 --> 18:36.216
Come on, Chip, let's go.

18:58.037 --> 18:59.772
Can I help you?

18:59.806 --> 19:01.441
-Hi. Hi.
-Hey.

19:01.474 --> 19:03.142
You're that girl who fell
off the stage

19:03.176 --> 19:04.277
-last night.
-Yeah.

19:04.311 --> 19:06.479
Uh, are you okay?

19:06.513 --> 19:09.015
Yeah, I'm good, I just...
I think I might have left

19:09.048 --> 19:11.351
my purse here last night,
and I was wondering

19:11.384 --> 19:13.620
if maybe you guys
happened to find it.

19:13.653 --> 19:16.155
Do you know how many purses
we have here, love?

19:16.189 --> 19:19.326
Maybe, like, five to ten?

19:19.359 --> 19:21.661
More than a few.

19:21.694 --> 19:23.663
Women really lose their heads.

19:23.696 --> 19:25.532
That makes sense.
Um...

19:25.565 --> 19:27.033
But we felt really bad.

19:27.066 --> 19:29.035
We wanted to give you
a free lap dance.

19:29.068 --> 19:30.337
Or a hat.

19:30.370 --> 19:32.138
Maybe I'll take the hat.

19:32.171 --> 19:33.906
-Oh.
-Sorry.

19:33.940 --> 19:37.076
I mean, you're really talented,
but I have a boyfriend--

19:37.109 --> 19:41.013
he's a shepherd-- and I want
to stay faithful to him.

19:41.047 --> 19:44.484
Okay.
I made the hat, too.

19:44.517 --> 19:46.319
-Oh, cool.
-Yeah, it's all good.

19:46.353 --> 19:47.887
I do all the merchandise here.

19:47.920 --> 19:49.656
Wow, that's really cool.

19:49.689 --> 19:52.359
Yeah.
Here you go.

19:52.392 --> 19:54.494
Um, okay...

19:54.527 --> 19:56.429
-Oh, here it is.
-Oh, nice.

19:56.463 --> 19:58.931
-Oop. Okay.
-There you go.

19:58.965 --> 20:00.933
Well, thanks a lot.

20:00.967 --> 20:05.004
Um... maybe I'll-I'll take
that hat now?

20:05.037 --> 20:07.039
Here you go.
Thank you.

20:08.107 --> 20:10.277
Well, that's it, Martha.

20:10.310 --> 20:13.446
Thank you for coming with me.

20:13.480 --> 20:15.615
-Oh...
-Oh, God,

20:15.648 --> 20:17.684
you're such a great wingman.

20:17.717 --> 20:19.286
I mean, wingwoman.

20:19.319 --> 20:22.021
-Aw... -But I should have
listened to you.

20:22.054 --> 20:24.357
I should have never forced
that stripper on you.

20:24.391 --> 20:26.058
I feel terrible.

20:26.092 --> 20:29.128
That's okay, Mrs. Baskets,
there are worse things.

20:29.161 --> 20:31.230
I just love you, Martha.

20:31.264 --> 20:33.199
Well, thanks, Mrs. Baskets.

20:33.232 --> 20:37.036
Do we really have to leave
this woman's paradise?

20:37.069 --> 20:39.472
Well, probably.

20:39.506 --> 20:41.140
Okay.

20:41.173 --> 20:43.276
I love that hat.

20:43.310 --> 20:44.577
What does it say?

20:44.611 --> 20:46.713
MARTHA:
Uh, "License to drill."

20:46.746 --> 20:49.716
It's like a innuendo,
like a stripping...

20:49.749 --> 20:53.219
"Innuendo."
I love that word.

20:53.252 --> 20:57.089
DALE: A book? How is a book
gonna heal my back pain?

20:57.123 --> 20:59.225
Well, I didn't write it.

20:59.258 --> 21:02.228
"The brain doesn't want to
face up to the repressed anger,

21:02.261 --> 21:03.730
so it's running away from it."

21:03.763 --> 21:05.164
A bunch of psychobabble.

21:05.197 --> 21:06.633
Is that what you think,
that all this is

21:06.666 --> 21:08.100
just in my head?

21:08.134 --> 21:10.102
Well, I'll tell you
what's not in my head

21:10.136 --> 21:11.938
is my lawsuit, so if you think
you're gonna give me

21:11.971 --> 21:15.074
some rinky-dink, ho-dink,
boo-dink book,

21:15.107 --> 21:18.778
then you're sorely mistaken,
much like my back.

21:18.811 --> 21:20.513
I'm not thinking anything,

21:20.547 --> 21:22.782
and I want you to do
what you want to do.

21:22.815 --> 21:26.653
I just wanted to tell you
that you were right.

21:26.686 --> 21:29.155
I should've listened to you.

21:29.188 --> 21:31.691
I made a lot of mistakes.

21:31.724 --> 21:33.826
-We all did.
-That's right.

21:33.860 --> 21:36.663
-Chip made mistakes
on the clowns. -That's right.

21:36.696 --> 21:38.030
You made some mistakes
with the horses.

21:38.064 --> 21:41.534
But now what I'm saying
to you is,

21:41.568 --> 21:44.604
if we all stay in our own lanes
as business partners,

21:44.637 --> 21:46.339
we can get somewhere.

21:46.373 --> 21:48.274
And I will be listening

21:48.307 --> 21:51.878
to my financial wizard.

21:51.911 --> 21:54.180
That's you.

21:54.213 --> 21:57.817
So I'll get... You're saying
I'll get my money back?

21:57.850 --> 21:59.318
Yes.

21:59.352 --> 22:02.989
I'm a Lori Greiner
seminar graduate.

22:03.022 --> 22:05.992
-Look at this.

22:06.025 --> 22:08.628
Wow. I don't think

22:08.661 --> 22:11.030
I've ever seen you
stand up that straight.

22:11.063 --> 22:13.533
Yeah, I'm as wrecked
as a navy man during Fleet Week.

22:13.566 --> 22:15.568
-Do a twirl.
-I don't know if I can.

22:15.602 --> 22:16.669
Try it.

22:16.703 --> 22:19.205
-I can do a twirl.
-Oh...

22:19.238 --> 22:21.207
-Look at this, I'm Chip.
