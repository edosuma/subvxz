01:34.680 --> 01:37.478
Washington, D.C., here I come.

01:40.760 --> 01:42.398
See you, Son.

01:43.960 --> 01:45.757
Bye, Dad.

01:46.960 --> 01:48.552
See you, pumpkin.

01:48.800 --> 01:50.711
Bye-bye, daddy.

02:02.200 --> 02:03.713
Come here.

02:07.520 --> 02:09.078
Oh, God.

02:15.640 --> 02:21.192
Well, I can see by the stars on the wall,
it's time to go.

02:22.800 --> 02:25.268
- See you, Kelly.
- Come on.

02:35.160 --> 02:36.752
Thanks a lot, Dad.

02:37.000 --> 02:39.230
Now I'll never know his name.

02:41.200 --> 02:42.633
Pumpkin, you have to understand.

02:42.880 --> 02:46.873
Part of being a parent
is protecting the morals of my children.

02:47.120 --> 02:49.918
Okay, move. No, don't move.

02:50.160 --> 02:51.798
Okay, move.

02:52.040 --> 02:55.510
Wait, wait. Damn.

03:00.080 --> 03:03.038
Now, pumpkin, as you know...

03:03.840 --> 03:05.876
...as you know,
Daddy's going to Washington...

03:06.120 --> 03:08.873
...to make America safe
for Psycho Dad.

03:09.280 --> 03:10.679
Now, when your mom wakes up...

03:10.920 --> 03:13.832
...and she will
because she knows I hate that...

03:15.280 --> 03:17.635
...remember, you haven't seen me.

03:18.720 --> 03:21.518
So it's like I'm doing you a favour?

03:22.800 --> 03:24.552
Exactly.

03:25.960 --> 03:27.791
Hey, Bud, did you hear that?

03:28.040 --> 03:31.874
Dad wants us to do him a favour.

03:36.840 --> 03:39.673
I'll call you. I mean it. I love you.

03:41.640 --> 03:45.110
What he means is,
is that if we do you a favour...

03:45.360 --> 03:47.112
...then we should get one in return.

03:47.360 --> 03:49.715
You know, squid pro quo.

03:52.080 --> 03:53.911
No party.

03:54.360 --> 03:56.954
- Mom...
- Oh, wait, pumpkin.

03:57.880 --> 04:00.269
Just try to keep the party
small this time.

04:00.480 --> 04:02.471
Oh, thank you, Daddy. I promise.

04:02.720 --> 04:06.395
Well, I mean, how much fun
could it be? Bud's gonna be there.

04:07.160 --> 04:09.151
Tell me about it.

04:09.760 --> 04:12.320
- AI?
- Oh, no.

04:13.240 --> 04:15.674
Al, it is 5 in the morning.

04:15.920 --> 04:18.195
- Where are you going?
- Fishing, Peg.

04:18.440 --> 04:20.077
Ice fishing, to be exact.

04:20.320 --> 04:22.754
You never used to like ice fishing.

04:23.000 --> 04:26.834
Am I not permitted to grow
as a human being, Peg?

04:27.960 --> 04:29.518
Well, I don't know, Al.

04:29.760 --> 04:33.548
Well, if you don't believe me,
here's one of my ice-fishing friends.

04:34.280 --> 04:36.396
Hey, buddy.

04:41.720 --> 04:44.188
You ready to go deer hunting?

04:45.920 --> 04:48.115
You mean ice fishing, don't you,
Jefferson?

04:48.360 --> 04:50.669
- I voted no on ice...
- Come on.

04:52.960 --> 04:55.713
Did I say deer hunting?

04:55.960 --> 04:58.599
- I meant ice fishing.
- Yeah, Peg.

04:58.840 --> 05:02.469
See, Jefferson forgot that a big part
of ice fishing is getting the bait...

05:02.680 --> 05:04.750
...and in this case...

05:05.600 --> 05:07.158
...it's deer.

05:13.440 --> 05:16.477
Fish love deer.

05:20.040 --> 05:22.190
Well, let's go.

05:22.680 --> 05:25.433
Hey, guys, ready to go skiing?

05:32.760 --> 05:35.274
Excuse us one minute, Peg.

05:38.840 --> 05:40.558
Ready, break.

05:49.840 --> 05:53.958
So you see, Peg,
after Jefferson gets the deer bait...

05:55.080 --> 05:58.789
...Griff has to ski it
down to the lake...

05:59.560 --> 06:02.472
...where Ike has set up camp...

06:03.520 --> 06:08.071
...and Bob Rooney scuba dives it
into the lake...

06:08.280 --> 06:11.511
...to see which fish
are the hungriest...

06:13.200 --> 06:14.838
...telling Officer Dan...

06:15.080 --> 06:19.995
...so he in turn
can smoke signal the information...

06:21.440 --> 06:24.477
...back to me so I can ice fish...

06:24.720 --> 06:28.076
...with utmost confidence.

06:35.080 --> 06:38.197
Of course. Have a nice time, boys.

06:38.440 --> 06:42.592
Let's go. Move them out. Mush.

06:45.280 --> 06:51.071
- Catch a big one, Al.
- Oh, I already have, Peg.

07:00.640 --> 07:04.428
Hello, Marcie.
Yeah, they just left for D.C.

07:05.640 --> 07:09.952
All right. I'll meet you at the airport
around noonish? Great. See you.

07:33.200 --> 07:37.318
Here we are, boys:
City of Brotherly Love.

07:38.760 --> 07:40.716
No, that's Philadelphia.

07:40.960 --> 07:44.999
- Well, what's Washington?
- A team without a quarterback.

07:47.760 --> 07:49.637
You guys are so cynical.

07:49.840 --> 07:53.037
Here we are in the capitol of
the greatest nation in the free earth...

07:53.280 --> 07:55.953
...and you can't even appreciate...
Everybody down.

08:05.360 --> 08:08.079
Nice room you got us.

08:08.320 --> 08:11.392
Was the John Hinckley Arms booked?

08:12.960 --> 08:15.349
Relax,
we're not gonna be here that long.

08:15.600 --> 08:18.160
Tomorrow we address the Senate,
get Psycho Dad back on...

08:18.400 --> 08:22.996
...strap some fish on the hood
of the Dodge and back in Chicago.

08:23.320 --> 08:24.912
The Big Apple.

08:27.720 --> 08:29.631
I don't want to rain
on anybody's parade...

08:29.840 --> 08:33.196
...but what makes you think we can get
into Congress without credentials?

08:33.400 --> 08:35.356
Sonny Bono did.

08:39.440 --> 08:41.395
Besides, Jefferson said
he can get us in.

08:41.640 --> 08:45.189
And you gotta trust the guy
that's named after a president.

08:46.040 --> 08:48.474
I thought you were named
after Sherman Hemsley.

08:49.560 --> 08:53.553
- Yeah, you know...
- Guys, guys, guys. Let's not argue.

08:53.840 --> 08:57.549
We're in Washington. Let's take
advantage of what it has to offer.

08:57.840 --> 08:59.273
Griff, check out room service.

08:59.480 --> 09:03.268
Ike, fix that TV, so we don't have
to pay for the porn channel.

09:07.920 --> 09:11.629
Hey, Al, don't you wanna call home,
make sure Peg and the kids are okay?

09:11.880 --> 09:14.678
Relax, Jefferson.
Nothing's gonna happen.

09:15.320 --> 09:16.799
Late word today from Chicago...

09:17.040 --> 09:19.759
...where a simple house party
has spread lik e a virus...

09:20.000 --> 09:22.912
...in what's being described
as a Woodstock without the music.

09:23.120 --> 09:25.873
Police have been put
on tactical alert.

09:26.080 --> 09:32.394
Oh, Santa, I've been very, very bad.

09:36.800 --> 09:39.439
Hey, guys, we got porn on the TV.

09:39.680 --> 09:43.309
We got the clothes on our back.
We got the beds to ourselves.

09:43.560 --> 09:44.913
Dare I say it?

09:45.120 --> 09:47.873
It doesn't get any better than this.

09:55.040 --> 09:57.713
What took you so long?

09:59.160 --> 10:00.957
Ice fishing, huh?

10:01.200 --> 10:03.077
Well, we were on our way...

10:03.280 --> 10:07.034
...and Ike said he had never seen
the Washington Monument.

10:08.600 --> 10:11.876
Speaking of
the Washington Monument...

10:13.880 --> 10:16.235
What is that?

10:17.400 --> 10:21.552
C-SPAN is broadcasting
the Senate page tryouts.

10:24.480 --> 10:25.993
Hey, and what are you doing here?

10:26.240 --> 10:28.708
We came to stop you
from embarrassing yourselves.

10:36.840 --> 10:38.478
Too late.

10:40.320 --> 10:43.915
Now, what makes you guys think that
the Congress of the United States...

10:44.120 --> 10:46.714
...could possibly care
what you have to say?

10:46.960 --> 10:49.872
Don't you head lice realize...

10:50.280 --> 10:52.919
...that the people of America
have spoken...

10:53.160 --> 10:56.835
...and America is definitely
anti-violence. Look out!

11:17.480 --> 11:20.199
Damn postal workers.

11:22.680 --> 11:24.352
Hey, we're from Chicago.

11:24.560 --> 11:26.869
Don't you know
we invented random violence?

11:30.040 --> 11:33.476
I still say that you will never
get in to the Senate.

11:33.680 --> 11:37.434
We will so. Jefferson said
he knows people in high places.

11:37.680 --> 11:40.274
Jefferson knows jack.

11:41.520 --> 11:43.590
When are you gonna stop
telling the buffoons...

11:43.800 --> 11:45.995
...these fanciful Bondian tales
of derring-do.

11:46.200 --> 11:48.270
If you were half as creative
with your resume...

11:48.480 --> 11:52.268
- Good evening, Bullwinkle.
- Hello, Chopper. Geronimo.

11:56.880 --> 11:58.199
- Long time no see.
- What's up?

11:58.440 --> 12:01.034
Iraq, Iran, I married.

12:02.840 --> 12:05.434
- So, what time do you need the bird?
- 0600 will be fine.

12:05.640 --> 12:06.868
- Cool. Over.
- Out.

12:14.400 --> 12:18.996
You know, we are really going to
have to talk about your past someday.

12:27.400 --> 12:31.075
Ladies and gentlemen,
I give you the United States Senate.

12:37.760 --> 12:39.318
Look at it, guys.

12:39.560 --> 12:45.749
This is where it all happens.
The power, the intrigue, the chicks.

12:48.240 --> 12:51.357
Look, guys,
there is no way the U.S. Senate...

12:51.560 --> 12:54.711
...is gonna put aside the important
business of running this nation...

12:54.920 --> 12:57.798
...to discuss something as moronic
as Psycho Dad.

13:04.160 --> 13:09.188
We'll have to table this debate
on the Arab-Israeli peace accords.

13:09.840 --> 13:15.153
The men from NO MA'AM are here
to lobby on behalf of Psycho Dad.

13:21.320 --> 13:25.313
Oh, we are really going to
have to discuss your past.

13:25.560 --> 13:29.030
Would the group approach the chair
and take a seat, please?

13:30.160 --> 13:32.720
Hey, wait a second now.

13:32.960 --> 13:36.589
- Where are you two going?
- Well, up there with you.

13:36.840 --> 13:39.752
You can't think that we're gonna let you
fight for Psycho Dad...

13:39.960 --> 13:41.757
...without us having our say, do you?

13:43.040 --> 13:45.349
Oh, Bullwinkle...

14:03.160 --> 14:06.391
Good morning, gentlemen.
My name is Senator Furman...

14:06.600 --> 14:11.355
...and I am chairman of the Presidential
Subcommittee for Taste in Television.

14:11.640 --> 14:14.074
Hey, Al. "Taste in Television."

14:14.320 --> 14:17.039
- T-l...
- Shut up.

14:20.320 --> 14:23.073
You six are here to argue
on behalf of a television show...

14:23.280 --> 14:26.033
...that was recently cancelled
due to excessive violence...

14:26.240 --> 14:28.834
...namely Psycho Dad.

14:29.080 --> 14:31.992
- Now, who will begin?
- I will, sir.

14:32.240 --> 14:34.470
Remember, Al, short and to the point.

14:34.720 --> 14:37.598
Yeah, and don't say anything
that'll make us look stupid.

14:37.840 --> 14:39.796
No problem.

14:40.960 --> 14:44.032
Senators and senatorettes.

14:46.560 --> 14:49.836
Since man has evolved
from the mighty atom...

14:50.400 --> 14:53.676
...he has searched endlessly
for two things...

14:53.920 --> 14:57.310
...the other is entertainment.

14:59.040 --> 15:02.874
Entertainment was easy
for the simple caveman.

15:03.120 --> 15:07.398
Man brought home food,
woman burn it.

15:08.920 --> 15:13.391
Giant pterodactyl swoops down,
chases woman, she falls in mud.

15:13.640 --> 15:16.871
A good laugh was had by all.

15:22.000 --> 15:25.470
- Sit down, Mr. Bundy.
- Yes, Your Majesty.

15:27.760 --> 15:29.671
Anyone else?

15:30.600 --> 15:32.670
You there with the moons.

15:33.000 --> 15:34.479
Yes, sir.

15:36.200 --> 15:37.758
Well...

15:38.320 --> 15:40.880
...we just think you should
bring back Psycho Dad...

15:41.120 --> 15:45.989
...because he symbolized everything
that's great about this country.

15:46.240 --> 15:49.994
I mean, like, take the time he went
charging into that Indian village...

15:50.200 --> 15:53.954
...that was filled with unarmed women
and children. So he's blasting away...

15:56.600 --> 16:00.070
What the total stranger standing
beside me is trying to say...

16:00.280 --> 16:03.078
...is nobody talks
about the good side of Psycho Dad.

16:03.320 --> 16:05.436
Gentlemen, is it not true...

16:05.640 --> 16:09.315
...that the lyrics to the Psycho Dad
theme song, in part, reads:

16:09.520 --> 16:12.751
"He's quick with a gun
But he loves his son

16:13.000 --> 16:16.356
So he killed his wife
'Cause she weighed a ton"?

16:19.880 --> 16:21.154
In Psycho Dad's defence...

16:21.400 --> 16:25.075
...when he married her,
she wasn't fat, Your Bigness.

16:31.280 --> 16:32.713
Sir.

16:35.200 --> 16:37.953
As a peace officer
who's proud to be a NO MA'AMer...

16:38.200 --> 16:41.033
...I think we have to distinguish
between real violence...

16:41.240 --> 16:42.468
...and cartoon violence.

16:42.720 --> 16:45.029
Yeah, like last night...

16:45.280 --> 16:48.511
...when Dan here emptied his.38
into a crowd of punks?

16:48.760 --> 16:52.196
They knew this man
and his hot lead were for real.

16:52.440 --> 16:57.116
Now, a cartoon Dan, in the first place,
would have to be much better looking.

16:57.640 --> 17:00.837
- I submit this sketch.
- You...!

17:06.720 --> 17:10.109
- Is there anything else, gentlemen?
- Yeah.

17:10.520 --> 17:14.069
Look, I know we could have been
a little more articulate...

17:14.280 --> 17:17.511
...if we had taken notes
like I wanted to do...

17:17.720 --> 17:21.679
...instead of staying up all night
watching The Panty Clause.

17:24.240 --> 17:28.153
But our point here is we know
where real violence comes from...

17:28.400 --> 17:33.235
...and it's not from that magic box
I like to call TV.

17:33.440 --> 17:36.557
Oh, sure, the tube
can be blamed for a lot of things.

17:36.800 --> 17:39.030
Brent Musburger.

17:39.320 --> 17:41.072
Full House.

17:41.720 --> 17:45.793
Any show where overweight
female cops dress up as hookers.

17:46.000 --> 17:49.117
But violence, that's too easy.

17:49.360 --> 17:52.830
We've been brought up on Road Runner
cartoons and The Three Stooges.

17:53.080 --> 17:55.878
But how many of us have run a saw
across a bald guy's head?

17:57.520 --> 18:00.353
How many of us have drawn a tunnel
on the side of a mountain...

18:00.560 --> 18:03.677
...only to watch our loved ones
smash themselves into it?

18:04.720 --> 18:06.039
And you know why?

18:06.280 --> 18:09.795
Because we had parents,
ladies and gentlemen.

18:10.040 --> 18:13.589
Parents who said,
"Don't do what TV tells you to do.

18:13.840 --> 18:18.311
Do what we tell you to do,
or it's five across the eyes..."

18:22.240 --> 18:25.516
Anyway, I say if there's a problem
with TV today...

18:25.720 --> 18:28.598
...it's because parents
aren't saying that anymore.

18:28.840 --> 18:31.479
Take my kids, please.

18:34.120 --> 18:36.429
Thanks for the joke, Jefferson.

18:36.760 --> 18:39.194
Kennedy's on the floor.

18:39.680 --> 18:42.274
Kennedy's always on the floor.

18:44.360 --> 18:46.555
Anyway,
my kids may not be angels...

18:46.800 --> 18:49.473
...but when they screw up,
I don't blame TV.

18:49.720 --> 18:53.952
I put the blame squarely
where it belongs, on their mother.

18:59.480 --> 19:01.357
- And rap music.
- And rap music.

19:01.560 --> 19:03.790
- I like rap music.
- No. No, no.

19:04.000 --> 19:08.312
Guys, guys, I'm talking to the Senate.

19:09.840 --> 19:11.478
So in conclusion, I'd like to say...

19:11.680 --> 19:14.433
...the next time you want to find
the source of violence...

19:14.640 --> 19:17.200
...try looking
on the other side of the screen.

19:17.400 --> 19:19.311
Thank you...

19:19.600 --> 19:22.797
...and God save the queen.

19:33.640 --> 19:35.835
- What happens now?
- Well, unfortunately, Griff...

19:36.040 --> 19:39.237
...the wheels of justice
move very slowly.

19:39.800 --> 19:42.439
We've reached a decision, Mr. Bundy.

19:43.160 --> 19:46.391
Violence is not acceptable
in a civilized society.

19:46.640 --> 19:49.677
Psycho Dad's gone
and this meeting is adjourned.

20:00.080 --> 20:02.071
Take it easy, Griff.

20:02.720 --> 20:06.190
We might have lost Psycho Dad,
but we will win the war.

20:06.440 --> 20:08.271
It's not that.

20:08.520 --> 20:12.035
To tell the truth,
I never even liked Psycho Dad.

20:12.320 --> 20:14.595
Well, what is it then?

20:15.160 --> 20:18.311
I really thought
we were going ice fishing.

20:23.800 --> 20:27.588
- AI, if it means anything...
- It won't.

20:28.600 --> 20:30.830
- Let's go.
- We will win this thing, Peg.

20:31.080 --> 20:34.311
- Common sense will prevail.
- I know, dear.

20:34.560 --> 20:37.472
Hey, Peg, hey look at that.

20:50.440 --> 20:52.032
Well, thank you, Mr. Bundy.

20:52.280 --> 20:55.158
I would have been lost
without my Discover card.

20:55.920 --> 20:59.310
Is there anything I can do for you?

20:59.560 --> 21:03.155
Well, you can try
to put guys like that in jail.

21:03.680 --> 21:07.070
Or cancel Blossom. Maybe that's
where he got the idea to wear the hat.

21:15.960 --> 21:19.077
And in our continuing coverage
of the mother of all parties...

21:19.280 --> 21:21.191
...the Chicago blowout
has now engulfed...

21:21.400 --> 21:23.436
...a major portion
of the upper Midwest.

21:23.680 --> 21:26.069
The National Guard
has begun setting backparties...

21:26.280 --> 21:28.953
...in hopes of containing the melee.

21:29.305 --> 21:35.469
