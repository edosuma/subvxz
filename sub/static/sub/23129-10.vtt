00:01.830 --> 00:03.764
- Previously...

00:03.800 --> 00:06.337
- I'm from the future,
and I need help to return.

00:06.370 --> 00:09.067
- Who you think you are now,
you will have no memory of.

00:09.110 --> 00:12.535
- If I forget, make me
remember. I love you.

00:13.810 --> 00:15.209
- (Sally): I'm back.

00:15.240 --> 00:16.742
- As long as I am alive,

00:16.780 --> 00:19.249
I will keep you safe.

00:19.280 --> 00:21.112
What's the real
reason you came back?

00:21.150 --> 00:23.244
- To kill vampires
before they kill people.

00:23.290 --> 00:25.315
I killed our little boy.

00:25.350 --> 00:28.786
I drained every last drop

00:28.820 --> 00:30.652
from his tiny body.

00:30.690 --> 00:31.782
- (Sobbing): No!

00:31.830 --> 00:33.389
- What happened
last night?

00:33.430 --> 00:35.489
- I don't remember
everything,

00:35.530 --> 00:36.793
but I feel...

00:36.830 --> 00:38.764
- Joshy Boy's wolf
thought it would be OK

00:38.800 --> 00:40.791
to sleep with my wife
during the change!

00:40.840 --> 00:43.263
- What?
The wolf is winning!

00:43.310 --> 00:44.266
Just get out!

00:44.310 --> 00:46.199
- Please don't go.

00:46.240 --> 00:47.275
- I'm scared of you.

00:47.310 --> 00:48.402
Find a way to deal

00:48.440 --> 00:49.510
with what you are,

00:49.550 --> 00:50.904
"cause I can't.

00:53.850 --> 00:56.046
(Wolves howling in distance)

00:59.560 --> 01:01.619
- Can you tell us
why we're here?

01:01.660 --> 01:04.482
'Cause this took
a lot of convincing.

01:04.530 --> 01:07.693
- I just wanted to
apologize for everything

01:07.730 --> 01:11.121
and make tonight
a new start.

01:11.170 --> 01:14.390
- I'm only here to see what
you have to have to show us,

01:14.440 --> 01:15.532
not to make friends.

01:16.710 --> 01:18.565
- OK.

01:34.620 --> 01:36.850
(Exhaling)

01:38.630 --> 01:40.428
(Grunting)

01:47.440 --> 01:50.159
(Roaring)

01:57.510 --> 02:00.218
- What are we doing here?

02:00.250 --> 02:02.719
You dusted the majority
of their patrons.

02:02.750 --> 02:05.583
It just might be wise
to keep a low profile.

02:05.620 --> 02:06.587
- I agree.

02:06.620 --> 02:08.452
That's why I need you.

02:09.490 --> 02:12.755
You ended Amy's life yesterday.

02:12.800 --> 02:14.689
- I haven't forgotten.

02:14.730 --> 02:16.368
- I know that.

02:16.400 --> 02:18.129
I believe you.

02:21.340 --> 02:23.763
Sometimes
remorse isn't enough.

02:23.810 --> 02:26.006
A life for a life, Aidan.

02:28.940 --> 02:30.499
- Who's life?

02:30.550 --> 02:32.712
I don't understand.

02:32.750 --> 02:35.515
- Well, I've been
slowly chipping away

02:35.550 --> 02:37.609
at this vamp
population, but...

02:38.950 --> 02:41.783
I need to hit this
Boston dust where it hurts.

02:45.890 --> 02:48.291
That's their leader.

02:49.370 --> 02:50.667
You're gonna end him.

02:54.370 --> 02:55.929
- (Josh): I know
what you're doing.

02:55.970 --> 02:58.268
- (Sally): I'm just
having a conversation!

02:58.310 --> 02:59.471
- No, you're holding me up

02:59.510 --> 03:01.535
so I'll be here when
Nora picks up her stuff.

03:01.580 --> 03:02.809
- Is Nora coming
here? Good!

03:02.850 --> 03:03.806
- Sally, come on!

03:03.850 --> 03:05.500
- It gives you
a chance to say hi

03:05.550 --> 03:07.814
and let her know you're
getting your life together!

03:07.850 --> 03:09.340
- That's a great idea!

03:09.390 --> 03:10.949
Who wouldn't wanna be
with a cheater

03:10.990 --> 03:11.946
with anger issues?

03:11.990 --> 03:12.957
- Josh...
- No!

03:14.460 --> 03:15.689
She's moving out, Sally.

03:15.720 --> 03:17.427
- Well, don't let her, Josh!

03:17.460 --> 03:20.623
- Listen, I would have done
anything to make this work.

03:20.660 --> 03:23.823
I'm late. I gotta go meet up
with Andrew and Caroline.

03:23.870 --> 03:27.568
- OK, don't go start a new pack.
Just start fresh with Nora.

03:27.600 --> 03:30.262
- Sally, listen,
I know you spent years

03:30.310 --> 03:33.632
in, like, Back To the Future,
bizarro version of us,

03:33.680 --> 03:35.671
but in this world, right now...

03:37.880 --> 03:39.746
my wife is terrified of me.

03:41.450 --> 03:42.940
That's my reality.

03:44.350 --> 03:46.387
- Well, it was real to me!

03:46.420 --> 03:47.581
- What was real?

03:52.500 --> 03:55.322
(Aidan): If I forget,
make me remember.

03:55.360 --> 03:57.567
- I think I've
loved you for a while now.

03:57.600 --> 04:00.297
- Then make me remember.
I have to know.

04:01.500 --> 04:03.264
Sally?

04:03.310 --> 04:04.562
- What?

04:05.640 --> 04:07.278
Uh, nothing.

04:07.310 --> 04:09.301
Um...

04:09.350 --> 04:10.772
Nothing.

04:14.880 --> 04:16.848
Put some frickin' clothes on!

04:19.589 --> 04:21.853
(Birds calling)

04:24.530 --> 04:27.625
- You guys... You guys don't
do anything halfway, do you?

04:27.660 --> 04:29.628
- Well, we loved
our place in the city,

04:29.670 --> 04:30.865
but priorities change.

04:30.900 --> 04:31.867
- Oh, yeah?

04:31.900 --> 04:33.299
- It's so quiet.

04:33.340 --> 04:34.330
- It sure is.

04:34.370 --> 04:35.735
- It kind of
drives me bonkers!

04:35.770 --> 04:37.761
- Me too, but we'll
get used to it, right?

04:37.810 --> 04:40.700
The most important thing is
keeping April safe and sound.

04:40.740 --> 04:42.845
- That just wasn't
gonna happen in the city.

04:42.880 --> 04:44.302
- Hello, hello!

04:44.350 --> 04:45.306
- (Caroline): Hey!

04:45.350 --> 04:46.715
- Hey! Josh,
you made it!

04:46.750 --> 04:47.717
- Yeah, yeah.

04:47.750 --> 04:48.876
- Bring it in!

04:48.920 --> 04:51.014
Do you know how happy
I am that you're here?

04:51.050 --> 04:52.017
- Mm-hmm.

04:52.050 --> 04:53.586
- It's so good to see you!

04:53.620 --> 04:55.019
- So, what's up
with the, uh...

04:55.060 --> 04:56.721
(Clears throat)

04:56.760 --> 04:59.457
Are you preparing for the
apocalypse? The groceries...

04:59.500 --> 05:01.594
- You didn't tell
him about the party?

05:01.630 --> 05:04.725
- We invited the
entire pack by

05:04.770 --> 05:06.067
for a pre-turn housewarming.

05:06.100 --> 05:08.467
Thought we'd give 'em
the lay of the land,

05:08.500 --> 05:09.808
then tomorrow night, we run.

05:09.840 --> 05:11.934
- It'll be like
a long weekend with wolves.

05:11.970 --> 05:13.472
- You're all gonna turn here?

05:13.510 --> 05:14.671
- Yeah.
- That's the plan!

05:14.710 --> 05:15.939
- Part of keeping April safe

05:15.980 --> 05:17.607
is keeping the
pack safe, right?

05:17.650 --> 05:19.379
- It's too dangerous
for us to turn

05:19.420 --> 05:20.774
at the same place as last time.

05:20.820 --> 05:22.948
There's even news reports
of wolf sightings!

05:22.990 --> 05:24.788
- And with hunting
season starting...

05:24.820 --> 05:26.413
We found this place
just in time.

05:26.460 --> 05:28.053
- I got enough room,
it's just,

05:28.090 --> 05:29.683
I'd like it
if you were there,

05:29.730 --> 05:31.653
gave it your
seal of approval.

05:31.690 --> 05:34.489
- He won't do anything wolf-
related without asking you.

05:34.530 --> 05:35.691
- Amen to that!

05:35.730 --> 05:36.697
- Mm-hmm!

05:36.730 --> 05:37.800
- I'll try and make it.

05:37.830 --> 05:39.025
- Try? No, no, no, no.

05:39.070 --> 05:41.539
It's not a party
without our pack leader.

05:54.680 --> 05:57.115
- Why would you want
to change with that Mark guy?

05:57.150 --> 05:58.982
He punched you in the face!

05:59.020 --> 06:02.422
- Yeah, but to be fair,
I did wolf-mate his wife.

06:02.460 --> 06:03.780
<i>- OK, yep, yep,
in that case,</i>

06:03.830 --> 06:05.821
then you should definitely
change with them

06:05.860 --> 06:06.952
instead of Nora!

06:07.000 --> 06:09.128
- Nora doesn't wanna
be near me, OK?

06:09.160 --> 06:10.127
Human or wolf.

06:10.170 --> 06:11.865
Let's just let it go, please!

06:11.900 --> 06:12.867
- I can't!

06:12.900 --> 06:14.595
I can't let it go, Josh!

06:14.640 --> 06:16.529
You're a weird
wolf thing because of me,

06:16.570 --> 06:17.799
because of my spell.

06:17.840 --> 06:19.478
If I had been
there to finish it,

06:19.510 --> 06:21.478
maybe none of this
would have happened!

06:21.510 --> 06:24.002
- Yeah, right! And I'd
still be a wolf all the time.

06:24.050 --> 06:26.610
- Well, why don't you just
let me try to fix that?

06:26.650 --> 06:28.618
- No, absolutely not!
No more magic, OK?

06:28.650 --> 06:31.813
If you even try another spell,
we may never see you again!

06:31.850 --> 06:33.614
- You know what?
What if it works?

06:33.660 --> 06:35.412
What if I can get that guy back?

06:35.460 --> 06:36.621
Then, it's worth it to me.

06:36.660 --> 06:37.627
- It's not to me.

06:37.660 --> 06:38.855
Whatever I am now,

06:38.890 --> 06:40.051
I can deal with.

06:41.500 --> 06:43.867
Losing you forever...

06:43.900 --> 06:46.062
No, it's not
an option. I'm sorry.

06:47.640 --> 06:49.699
- Well, you're very
sweet and I love you,

06:49.740 --> 06:51.708
- but this wolf
is not who you are.

06:51.740 --> 06:53.174
That wolf
chased Nora away.

06:53.210 --> 06:55.804
- OK, Nora can't
accept what I am...

06:57.050 --> 06:59.178
understandably so, OK?

06:59.210 --> 07:01.520
But Mark and Andrew
and Caroline,

07:01.550 --> 07:04.190
they don't just accept me,
they want to be me.

07:04.220 --> 07:05.847
And it actually feels...

07:05.890 --> 07:07.449
kind of good.

07:07.490 --> 07:09.527
I mean, it feels good
to be, like, the alpha

07:09.560 --> 07:10.527
for once, you know?

07:10.560 --> 07:11.652
(Laughing)

07:11.690 --> 07:12.998
What?
- You're not the alpha.

07:13.030 --> 07:14.191
You think you're alpha?

07:14.230 --> 07:15.629
You're not.
You're a beta.

07:15.660 --> 07:17.890
You are a nice, solid beta.

07:17.930 --> 07:19.989
And that's OK! Because
everyone loves a beta!

07:20.040 --> 07:21.189
Nora loves her some beta--

07:21.240 --> 07:22.537
- Nora, who moved out...

07:23.640 --> 07:25.460
who slept
with a knife

07:25.510 --> 07:26.636
under her bed

07:26.680 --> 07:28.933
because she was afraid of me.

07:28.980 --> 07:30.641
- Nora...

07:31.850 --> 07:33.875
who I might have told
to come over later

07:33.920 --> 07:34.944
because you'd be here.

07:34.980 --> 07:36.641
See ya! Peace!

07:36.690 --> 07:37.646
- W-What?

07:37.690 --> 07:39.215
(Door closing)

07:42.660 --> 07:45.880
- I'm sorry. I can, uh...
I'll just come back.

07:45.930 --> 07:47.022
- It's totally fine.

07:47.060 --> 07:49.028
I'm on my way out.

07:49.060 --> 07:51.893
- Um... It'll only take
me a couple of hours

07:51.930 --> 07:53.762
to get the rest of my stuff.

07:53.800 --> 07:54.995
- Take your time.

07:58.110 --> 07:59.976
Hey, uh...
Do you have a...

08:01.840 --> 08:03.842
Do you have a place
to change tonight?

08:03.880 --> 08:06.577
- Yeah. You?

08:06.620 --> 08:08.543
- Mm-hmm, yeah.

08:09.620 --> 08:10.940
Hey, um...

08:14.260 --> 08:15.716
Just be safe.

08:15.760 --> 08:17.626
- You too.

08:23.970 --> 08:27.133
- It took 240 years,
but the streak is over.

08:27.170 --> 08:28.831
- What streak is that?

08:28.870 --> 08:30.861
- I've finally become
the nagging wife.

08:30.910 --> 08:32.105
(Laughing)

08:32.140 --> 08:33.732
We had an agreement.

08:33.780 --> 08:37.080
- Uh... You know, we didn't
exactly have an agreement,

08:37.110 --> 08:39.203
but what we talked over,
I haven't forgotten.

08:39.250 --> 08:41.616
- Every day that kid
is in charge, people die.

08:41.650 --> 08:44.017
The body count
keeps ticking up.

08:44.049 --> 08:46.849
- I'm not particularly
interested in a suicide mission.

08:46.890 --> 08:48.153
He's far too well-protected.

08:48.190 --> 08:50.158
- For me, maybe, but not you.

08:50.190 --> 08:52.158
I'm sure if Aidan Waite
asks for a meeting,

08:52.190 --> 08:53.157
he'll get one.

08:53.200 --> 08:54.258
Maybe you're not

08:54.300 --> 08:56.598
all that interested in changing.

08:56.630 --> 08:57.768
- Hey!

08:57.800 --> 08:59.097
- Maybe killing that girl,

08:59.130 --> 09:00.894
maybe that's just
who you are now.

09:00.940 --> 09:01.998
- No, it isn't!

09:02.040 --> 09:04.259
But I don't wanna
see anyone else die.

09:04.310 --> 09:05.630
That's it.

09:05.670 --> 09:06.705
- Then protect them.

09:06.740 --> 09:07.775
- What are you doing?

09:07.810 --> 09:08.902
Are you kidding me?

09:08.940 --> 09:10.647
- It's from our
church in Corwich.

09:10.680 --> 09:13.320
- That's the last place
I want a souvenir from!

09:13.350 --> 09:17.309
- It's not all that bad. We got
married there, baptised Isaac.

09:17.350 --> 09:20.285
After he died, I went
in there and I took that.

09:20.320 --> 09:21.617
I even said a prayer.

09:21.660 --> 09:22.923
- Said a prayer to what?

09:22.960 --> 09:25.782
It isn't like there's
a heaven waiting for us.

09:25.830 --> 09:27.992
- Well, maybe
there is for Isaac.

09:28.030 --> 09:29.668
When I made that,

09:29.700 --> 09:32.590
killing other vampires was
the last thing on my mind.

09:32.640 --> 09:34.699
- You were gonna
use this on yourself.

09:36.940 --> 09:40.069
It's harder than
it seems, isn't it?

09:40.110 --> 09:41.635
- You thought about it too?

09:41.680 --> 09:42.647
(Laughing)

09:42.680 --> 09:44.000
- Yeah.

09:44.050 --> 09:46.815
Sometimes, I think
it's the only decent thing

09:46.850 --> 09:47.817
that we can do,

09:47.850 --> 09:49.215
but I never could either.

09:49.250 --> 09:53.050
- You think I have
self-discipline, willpower.

09:54.990 --> 09:58.028
If I did, I would have
been dust centuries ago.

09:58.060 --> 09:59.619
- Beating yourself up over it

09:59.660 --> 10:01.196
isn't gonna help
anything either.

10:01.230 --> 10:03.096
- It'll help the next Isaac.

10:04.870 --> 10:08.693
You think those new vampires
are really that different,

10:08.740 --> 10:10.037
that they're so evolved?

10:10.070 --> 10:12.630
You should pull your
head out of the sand

10:12.680 --> 10:14.830
and go see what
they're really doing.

10:14.880 --> 10:16.678
- Hey, I'd be happy
to check out--

10:16.710 --> 10:18.007
- And then,
put an end to it!

10:21.220 --> 10:22.949
(Sighing)

10:22.990 --> 10:25.687
- Sorry things are still
rocky between you and Nora.

10:25.720 --> 10:26.983
- Well, that makes 2 of us.

10:27.020 --> 10:28.988
- It's like she knew you
a certain way,

10:29.020 --> 10:29.987
but you're just...

10:30.030 --> 10:31.987
You're not that guy anymore.

10:32.030 --> 10:33.350
You're this guy.

10:33.400 --> 10:35.755
And this guy is awesome.

10:36.900 --> 10:37.970
- Thanks, man.

10:38.000 --> 10:39.866
Yeah, I don't
know, I'm, uh...

10:39.900 --> 10:42.232
I can't believe
I'm saying this, I'm, um...

10:43.370 --> 10:45.805
almost looking
forward to this turn.

10:45.840 --> 10:47.808
- Because you're with us.

10:47.840 --> 10:50.207
And I mean this
when I say this:

10:50.250 --> 10:54.016
Everyone here gets you, Josh.

10:54.050 --> 10:55.245
And Nora will too.

10:55.280 --> 10:57.248
She just has to come around

10:57.290 --> 10:59.019
and deal with
what you are now.

10:59.050 --> 11:00.017
- You're right.

11:00.060 --> 11:01.209
It just...

11:01.260 --> 11:05.822
It's so weird
not turning with her.

11:05.860 --> 11:07.123
- If it's any consolation,

11:07.160 --> 11:09.128
it looks like we're
both flying solo.

11:09.160 --> 11:10.423
- Wendy's not here?

11:10.470 --> 11:12.063
- Uh, she, uh...

11:13.340 --> 11:15.092
wanted to take a bit of time,

11:15.140 --> 11:17.905
you know, away
from everything.

11:17.940 --> 11:20.773
- I'm... Should we...
I'm so sorry, by the way.

11:20.810 --> 11:22.744
I don't know...
- I don't want to...

11:23.780 --> 11:25.043
- Should we talk about it?

11:25.080 --> 11:26.400
- No. About what happened?

11:26.450 --> 11:27.417
No, let's...

11:27.450 --> 11:29.919
What's up, Andrew?

11:29.950 --> 11:31.839
Look, I had a blowup,

11:31.890 --> 11:35.713
but I promise it will
never happen again,

11:35.760 --> 11:38.855
not after I realized
what you are.

11:38.890 --> 11:40.198
- What am I?

11:40.230 --> 11:43.063
- You're this special
kind of wolf.

11:43.100 --> 11:46.070
The way you can change
whenever you want,

11:46.100 --> 11:48.194
do you know
how amazing that is?

11:48.240 --> 11:50.038
When I saw that, I got it.

11:50.070 --> 11:54.075
I saw what Wendy saw,
and it's pheromones, man!

11:55.110 --> 11:56.475
You can't fight that!

11:56.510 --> 11:58.274
- OK...

11:58.310 --> 12:02.144
- And I realized that the wolf
knows things before we do,

12:02.180 --> 12:04.490
and I have to
trust those instincts.

12:04.520 --> 12:06.887
- Deviled-egg dude!

12:06.920 --> 12:08.183
- Hey, man!

12:08.220 --> 12:10.222
- Hey, how are you?
- Good. And you?

12:10.260 --> 12:11.421
- How's the arm?

12:11.460 --> 12:12.484
- Fully operational.

12:12.530 --> 12:13.725
- That's good.

12:14.830 --> 12:16.150
- You must be Josh.

12:16.200 --> 12:18.089
- Yeah, I am.

12:18.130 --> 12:19.894
- It's so great
to finally meet you.

12:19.940 --> 12:22.034
He's taller than I thought.

12:22.070 --> 12:23.765
- He is, yeah.

12:23.810 --> 12:25.835
- I'm standing right here.

12:25.870 --> 12:28.180
- I heard about how you
delivered Caroline's baby.

12:28.210 --> 12:30.201
- Oh, I didn't do--
It was my wife, mostly.

12:30.250 --> 12:31.479
- Dude, it was you.

12:31.510 --> 12:33.820
- It was me and my--
me and my wife.

12:33.850 --> 12:35.113
- It was him.

12:35.150 --> 12:36.447
- It takes
a special person

12:36.480 --> 12:37.914
to do that for a stranger.

12:37.950 --> 12:39.111
- I do what I can!

12:39.150 --> 12:41.152
- That's why I trust you.

12:45.230 --> 12:47.824
Anyway, I can't wait
to see you later.

12:50.030 --> 12:51.225
- Isn't she cute?

12:53.370 --> 12:55.395
- What the hell
is she doing here, man?

12:55.440 --> 12:56.965
- By the way she spoke to you,

12:57.010 --> 12:58.409
I'm guessing
whatever you want.

12:58.440 --> 13:01.876
- No, I mean, why would
they bring her here, now?

13:01.910 --> 13:06.245
- She's here for the same
reason as everyone else is here,

13:06.280 --> 13:07.418
to turn together.

13:07.450 --> 13:08.417
- I can smell her.

13:08.450 --> 13:09.440
She's not a wolf!

13:11.050 --> 13:12.040
- Not yet.

13:25.170 --> 13:28.435
- (Kenny): If you're ever
unsure, buddy, you can go to Jo.

13:28.470 --> 13:30.404
And then, uh...

13:34.110 --> 13:35.271
- Hey!

13:36.340 --> 13:38.479
- Hey! I recognize that voice!

13:38.510 --> 13:39.477
- How are you doing?

13:39.510 --> 13:40.477
- I'm good.

13:40.520 --> 13:42.010
Did I owe you
a phone call?

13:42.050 --> 13:43.085
- Mm-mmm.
- OK, good.

13:43.120 --> 13:45.043
"Cause I've been
pretty crazed here.

13:45.090 --> 13:46.444
- No kidding!
What's going on?

13:46.490 --> 13:47.582
- It's a lot, I know.

13:47.620 --> 13:49.486
It's weird how
quickly we're blowing up.

13:49.520 --> 13:51.022
- Indeed, right.

13:51.060 --> 13:52.550
How does this all
fit in with your

13:52.590 --> 13:54.456
"we're doing
things differently" spiel?

13:54.500 --> 13:56.127
- Oh, we are.

13:56.160 --> 13:58.322
I mean, who knew
that vampire repopulation

13:58.370 --> 14:00.338
was gonna be such
a growth industry?

14:00.370 --> 14:03.067
- Well, anybody who's ever
sold anything to an addict.

14:03.110 --> 14:04.236
- Well, don't worry.

14:04.270 --> 14:06.102
We've still got
the full veggie options

14:06.140 --> 14:07.175
at our new blood dens.

14:07.210 --> 14:08.575
- Oh, at the
blood dens? Really?

14:08.610 --> 14:10.942
How many blood dens
do you have these days?

14:10.980 --> 14:12.209
- Just a few.

14:12.250 --> 14:14.218
- Not that you
asked me my advice,

14:14.250 --> 14:17.345
but don't you think you ought
to just slow down a little bit?

14:17.390 --> 14:20.553
- Well, I mean, I'm barely
doing anything. I'm serious!

14:20.590 --> 14:23.480
People are actually
coming to me, from everywhere:

14:23.530 --> 14:25.157
Providence,
Baltimore, Buffalo...

14:25.190 --> 14:27.500
See, they want me to do there
what I'm doing here.

14:27.530 --> 14:30.500
- Well, you know that
you can always say no, right?

14:30.530 --> 14:32.396
- Well, I mean,
it's kind of rude

14:32.430 --> 14:34.068
not to hear them out, right?

14:34.100 --> 14:35.170
- Hmm.

14:35.200 --> 14:37.237
- You know what people like?

14:37.270 --> 14:38.305
- What's that?

14:38.340 --> 14:41.002
- See, most of the
old-timers are grim.

14:41.040 --> 14:42.906
- I hope you don't mean me!

14:42.950 --> 14:44.349
- No offense.
Just listen.

14:44.380 --> 14:48.248
They're all about the
"plague this, Bishop that."

14:48.280 --> 14:50.487
Most of the new ones
didn't want to be turned.

14:50.520 --> 14:51.988
- Hmm...

14:52.020 --> 14:53.112
- I mean, you know me.

14:53.160 --> 14:55.288
This is all I've ever
really cared about.

14:55.320 --> 14:57.027
You gotta be
a fan first, right?

14:57.060 --> 14:58.084
Don't get me wrong.

14:58.130 --> 15:00.098
I'm not trying
to harsh the old regime.

15:00.130 --> 15:01.598
I'm saying
there's improvements.

15:01.630 --> 15:03.268
We're a little more open-minded.

15:03.300 --> 15:05.268
We're not locked
in the way of thinking

15:05.300 --> 15:07.064
that the old guys were.

15:07.100 --> 15:10.309
- Well, look, you are
sitting where Bishop sat

15:10.340 --> 15:13.537
and you are telling me
how different you are.

15:13.580 --> 15:15.105
I was there,

15:15.140 --> 15:17.279
and I knew all of
Bishop's plans.

15:19.280 --> 15:21.169
You're starting
to sound like Bishop.

15:21.220 --> 15:23.939
- Just blue sky-ing here.

15:25.120 --> 15:26.246
Oh, yeah, sorry.

15:26.290 --> 15:28.110
Can you give me
one second? Thanks.

15:29.460 --> 15:31.349
Everybody knows
what they're doing?

15:31.390 --> 15:34.030
If you have questions
or concerns, come to me.

15:48.380 --> 15:49.336
- Hey!
- Hey!

15:49.380 --> 15:51.269
Aidan, you remember
Astrid, right?

15:51.310 --> 15:52.641
- Yeah!

15:52.680 --> 15:55.069
- The world's worst baby shower!
- Indeed, yeah!

15:55.120 --> 15:57.088
- I'm sorry my friends
trashed your place.

15:57.120 --> 15:59.088
- Believe me. That place
has seen worse.

15:59.120 --> 16:00.485
Are you allowed to be here?

16:00.520 --> 16:02.488
- Yeah. I mean,
I got some glares.

16:02.520 --> 16:04.386
- Yeah, but if
anybody has a problem,

16:04.430 --> 16:05.659
they keep it to themselves.

16:05.690 --> 16:07.351
- They've actually
been way cooler

16:07.400 --> 16:09.095
than my pack has to Kenny.

16:09.130 --> 16:11.497
- Really?
- You break one guy's arm...

16:11.530 --> 16:12.668
- They'll get over it!

16:12.700 --> 16:14.498
Or I'll stop
turning with them.

16:14.540 --> 16:15.564
- OK.

16:15.600 --> 16:17.500
- Andrew and Caroline
invited us all

16:17.540 --> 16:19.304
to their new place
for the turn.

16:20.380 --> 16:22.109
Anyways, I should get going.

16:22.140 --> 16:24.677
- Well, the turn is
tomorrow, though, right?

16:24.710 --> 16:26.747
- Yeah, they want
some pack bonding time.

16:26.780 --> 16:29.272
I just hope they don't
make us do trust falls.

16:29.320 --> 16:31.288
- Well, I packed you
a change bag,

16:31.320 --> 16:33.652
and I might have thrown in
an extra rump roast.

16:33.690 --> 16:35.681
- I saw it,
and your note.

16:39.260 --> 16:41.251
You did all right
with this one!

16:41.300 --> 16:42.290
(Laughing)

16:46.100 --> 16:47.659
- OK, look,
I know that expansion

16:47.700 --> 16:49.031
is a dirty word to you,

16:49.070 --> 16:50.765
but if I can go
anywhere with Astrid

16:50.810 --> 16:52.300
and not get hassled for it,

16:52.340 --> 16:53.705
I'm gonna do it!

16:53.740 --> 16:55.606
- Kenny, you can do
whatever you want.

16:55.640 --> 16:59.577
You can compel whoever you want,
you can go wherever you want.

16:59.610 --> 17:01.317
So, let me ask you this:

17:01.350 --> 17:04.387
Are you doing
all of this for her...

17:05.619 --> 17:07.213
or is it for you?

17:17.700 --> 17:19.190
- No!

17:19.230 --> 17:20.231
(Screaming)

17:20.270 --> 17:21.237
- What the hell?

17:21.270 --> 17:22.589
- I'm saving you
from yourself?

17:22.640 --> 17:24.460
- You saved me from aspirin!

17:24.510 --> 17:25.762
- Oh, sorry,
ghost foul.

17:25.810 --> 17:28.404
- What did you think
I was taking?

17:28.440 --> 17:30.670
- I don't know!
Uppers, downers, reds, blues...

17:30.710 --> 17:32.678
Whatever gets you
through the day. Sorry.

17:32.710 --> 17:35.145
- OK, I've had my vices,

17:35.180 --> 17:37.148
but pills ain't it!

17:37.190 --> 17:38.442
(Scoffing)

17:38.490 --> 17:40.379
- Well, maybe not
in this life,

17:40.420 --> 17:43.629
but when I went back in time,
you went hardcore nurse Jackie.

17:43.660 --> 17:45.287
- I did?
- Yeah.

17:45.330 --> 17:47.526
You don't have to be
so thrilled about it.

17:47.560 --> 17:49.654
- What? It's not like
it actually happened.

17:49.700 --> 17:52.226
- I really wish that people
would stop saying that.

17:52.270 --> 17:54.238
It did actually happen.
It happened to me.

17:54.270 --> 17:55.829
Every second of it
actually happened.

17:55.870 --> 17:57.736
And by the way,

17:57.770 --> 17:59.807
that's how I know
that in either version,

17:59.840 --> 18:01.501
you and Josh
are better together.

18:01.540 --> 18:02.678
- You don't think

18:02.710 --> 18:04.542
I wanna believe that too?

18:06.450 --> 18:10.239
So, what else happened
when you went back in time?

18:12.350 --> 18:15.559
- Well, um, I left Danny.

18:17.260 --> 18:18.625
I became a werewolf.

18:18.660 --> 18:20.253
Yeah.

18:20.300 --> 18:23.361
And somewhere
along the line,

18:23.400 --> 18:25.562
I sort of...

18:26.900 --> 18:29.392
I kind of fell
in love with Aidan.

18:29.440 --> 18:31.169
- Um, you what?

18:31.210 --> 18:34.236
You--you fell
in love with Aidan?

18:34.280 --> 18:37.375
- Yes! And it's not the most
ridiculous thing you ever heard!

18:37.410 --> 18:39.469
- No, my God!
Not at all! It's just...

18:40.520 --> 18:41.874
It's just unexpected!

18:41.920 --> 18:43.342
<i>- I know.</i>

18:43.390 --> 18:46.382
And until Ray
accidentally murdered me

18:46.420 --> 18:49.515
and turned me into
a ghost again,

18:49.560 --> 18:52.279
it was kind of
the greatest thing ever.

18:53.830 --> 18:55.719
- Well, does Aidan know?

18:55.760 --> 18:57.762
I mean, obviously,
that Aidan knew.

18:57.800 --> 18:59.689
But this Aidan,
did you tell him?

18:59.730 --> 19:02.631
- No! God no! No!

19:02.670 --> 19:06.607
First of all, healthy
enough ego on that boy as is.

19:07.810 --> 19:11.701
Also, back then,
it was possible.

19:11.750 --> 19:12.945
I was alive!

19:12.980 --> 19:15.278
Even when I was
a wolf, I was alive.

19:15.320 --> 19:16.719
And now, meh-meh.

19:16.750 --> 19:20.709
- But you guys could
still be together, mostly.

19:20.760 --> 19:23.479
- Yeah, I don't think
he thinks of me that way.

19:24.860 --> 19:26.658
And it's OK,
"cause I didn't either

19:26.690 --> 19:29.421
until I got to go back
and do it over from scratch.

19:29.460 --> 19:32.669
And he never gets to do that,
so I just don't...

19:32.700 --> 19:37.399
I don't--I don't see how
he could feel like that for me.

19:37.440 --> 19:39.738
- OK, no more CliffsNotes.

19:40.980 --> 19:42.630
I need to know everything.

19:42.680 --> 19:43.647
(Laughing)

19:43.680 --> 19:45.444
- OK.

19:45.480 --> 19:46.800
- Josh, hey,
hey, hey, hey!

19:46.850 --> 19:48.340
- Do you know
about this?

19:48.380 --> 19:51.213
He's planning on turning
all these people into wolves!

19:51.250 --> 19:52.911
- Yeah, it was our idea.

19:53.960 --> 19:55.450
- What?

19:55.490 --> 19:56.719
You can't do this!

19:56.760 --> 19:59.252
They have no idea
what's about to happen to them!

19:59.290 --> 20:01.349
- You said you'd
help us build the pack.

20:01.400 --> 20:02.925
This is what we need!
- No! No!

20:02.960 --> 20:06.294
No, I said that I would teach
you what I know, all right?

20:06.330 --> 20:08.560
I will never, ever
pass this on willingly!

20:08.600 --> 20:10.637
- You were alone
when you were attacked.

20:10.670 --> 20:12.559
It'll be different.
- This is insane.

20:12.610 --> 20:15.500
- These people are gonna have
us, a support system, a family.

20:15.540 --> 20:16.769
- Yeah, a Manson family!

20:16.810 --> 20:18.574
I can't believe I didn't see--

20:18.610 --> 20:20.647
They'll be killers.
Did you explain that?

20:20.680 --> 20:21.772
- Just calm down.

20:21.820 --> 20:23.811
- Don't tell me
to calm down, Mark.

20:23.850 --> 20:25.284
- You met Charlotte.

20:25.320 --> 20:26.845
Does she look like a victim?

20:26.890 --> 20:28.881
No! She wants to be here.

20:28.920 --> 20:31.628
Everyone chose
to be with us, OK?

20:31.660 --> 20:34.254
- And you, man,
you are the only one--

20:34.300 --> 20:35.449
- Don't touch me!

20:37.700 --> 20:40.692
- You are the only one
who can do this.

20:40.740 --> 20:42.560
- You're out of luck then.

20:42.600 --> 20:46.332
- We can't scratch them, not
safely, not with the full moon.

20:46.370 --> 20:50.000
As werewolves, we'll be too out
of control! We'll go too far!

20:50.040 --> 20:51.804
- We've seen what you can do.

20:51.850 --> 20:53.978
You're the only one
who can change at will!

20:54.020 --> 20:55.909
We're just gonna
scratch the new ones.

20:55.950 --> 20:57.987
- That's why you
invited me here.

20:58.020 --> 21:00.557
This is it, huh?

21:00.590 --> 21:03.787
Well, you either just did
a piss-poor job explaining it

21:03.830 --> 21:05.389
to those people

21:05.430 --> 21:07.489
or you just recruited
a bunch of psychopaths.

21:07.530 --> 21:09.350
Either way, I'm out
of here! This is--

21:09.400 --> 21:10.890
- Josh...
- Get out of my way.

21:10.930 --> 21:12.819
- Josh, I'm sorry.
- The pack needs you.

21:12.870 --> 21:14.861
(Screaming)

21:24.380 --> 21:26.439
- I know this sounds weird,

21:26.480 --> 21:28.710
but I know exactly
how you feel,

21:30.690 --> 21:31.839
- Oh yeah?

21:31.890 --> 21:34.382
You spend a lot of time
naked in a cage?

21:34.420 --> 21:36.787
- I was just like
you, Josh.

21:36.820 --> 21:40.791
Afraid, convinced that being
a wolf was a death sentence.

21:40.830 --> 21:44.368
The thought of passing it on
to somebody else was terrifying,

21:44.400 --> 21:45.799
but then I had April.

21:45.830 --> 21:48.094
- She's your
ch--child, Andrew.

21:48.140 --> 21:49.938
It's completely different.

21:49.970 --> 21:51.460
- You're gonna see, Josh.

21:51.510 --> 21:53.979
Making your own wolf,
it's not curse at all!

21:54.010 --> 21:57.674
Having April was the best thing
that I ever did with my life.

21:57.710 --> 21:59.872
- If you're so convinced
I'm gonna love it,

21:59.910 --> 22:02.413
why don't you let me the hell
out of the cage, huh?

22:02.450 --> 22:03.747
- We can't do
that, Josh.

22:03.790 --> 22:07.613
See, the cage is gonna
keep everyone safe.

22:07.660 --> 22:09.116
They just
get a scratch.

22:09.160 --> 22:11.925
- And how do you know that
I'm not gonna turn on you, huh?

22:11.960 --> 22:13.655
When I change?
How do you know?

22:13.700 --> 22:15.429
- Because we are
your pack now.

22:15.460 --> 22:16.825
- That's right.

22:16.860 --> 22:19.466
- And we're gonna fall in line
like we always have.

22:19.500 --> 22:21.935
And you, you would never
hurt your own pups.

22:21.970 --> 22:23.506
- You already have a pack!

22:23.540 --> 22:26.430
You already have one!
Why do you need more wolves?

22:26.470 --> 22:28.802
- One day, the truce
with those parasites

22:28.840 --> 22:30.137
IS gonna come
to an end.

22:30.180 --> 22:31.670
(Groaning)

22:31.710 --> 22:34.020
You have to understand
that when that happens,

22:34.050 --> 22:35.609
we have to be ready.

22:35.650 --> 22:38.017
- The vamps can choose
who can join them and when.

22:38.050 --> 22:39.518
Us, it's more random.

22:39.550 --> 22:41.985
You scratch somebody
during a full moon,

22:42.020 --> 22:43.112
and they're one of us.

22:43.160 --> 22:44.685
But with you leading us,

22:44.730 --> 22:47.495
we could finally choose
who's part of our family too!

22:47.530 --> 22:49.055
And once you made
a few of your own,

22:49.100 --> 22:52.126
you're gonna realize this is
what you were meant to do.

22:52.170 --> 22:53.592
- This is crazy.

22:53.640 --> 22:55.768
Just know that what
you're asking me to do,

22:55.800 --> 22:57.507
I will never do this.

22:57.540 --> 23:00.009
- We have seen your true wolf,
Josh. You showed us.

23:00.040 --> 23:03.032
And that is who we need
helping us right now.

23:03.080 --> 23:05.742
Come on, Josh!
Show him to us again.

23:05.780 --> 23:08.477
- Never.

23:08.520 --> 23:11.842
(Sighing)

23:21.600 --> 23:23.921
What are you doing?

23:23.970 --> 23:25.096
- I'm sorry, Josh.

23:25.130 --> 23:26.598
- No. No, no, no.

23:26.630 --> 23:27.791
No, stop.

23:27.840 --> 23:29.569
- This is for everyone's good.

23:29.600 --> 23:30.761
- No! Stop!

23:30.810 --> 23:32.733
(Screaming)

23:32.770 --> 23:34.829
(Growling)

23:37.240 --> 23:39.709
- Do it again!
Do it again!

23:39.750 --> 23:42.276
(Screaming)

23:45.150 --> 23:49.883
(Bones cracking, Josh growling)

23:59.730 --> 24:03.667
(Wolf growling)

24:03.710 --> 24:05.462
- Josh ran a pie shop?

24:05.510 --> 24:06.568
(Laughing)

24:06.610 --> 24:08.874
That actually doesn't
sound that bad!

24:08.910 --> 24:10.071
- No, he was miserable.

24:10.110 --> 24:11.703
Trust.

24:11.750 --> 24:12.899
(Sighing)

24:12.950 --> 24:15.146
- Am I horrible if
that makes me feel

24:15.180 --> 24:16.739
just a little bit good?

24:16.780 --> 24:18.544
- Don't pretend
you don't know.

24:18.590 --> 24:21.184
The guy is a wreck without you,
past, present, future.

24:21.220 --> 24:22.654
You know it!

24:22.690 --> 24:24.852
- I know, but if I stay,
I'm enabling him,

24:24.890 --> 24:28.121
this violent guy
that he's OK with.

24:28.160 --> 24:30.151
If I stay in this house,

24:30.200 --> 24:33.989
the next time someone
gets hurt or worse...

24:34.040 --> 24:37.635
- I know. I know. It just breaks
my heart to see you go.

24:40.780 --> 24:41.872
(Siren wailing)

24:41.910 --> 24:43.071
(Knocking)

24:48.920 --> 24:50.979
(Sighing)

24:51.020 --> 24:53.819
- Hmm, you look unhappy.

24:53.860 --> 24:56.955
Is that because you kept your
word or because you broke it?

24:56.990 --> 25:00.153
- You're not the only one
that I gave my word to.

25:00.190 --> 25:02.830
- What? Like you owe
those vampires something?

25:02.860 --> 25:04.021
- Not all of them, no.

25:04.070 --> 25:05.265
But Kenny, yeah, I do.

25:05.300 --> 25:07.689
Suzanna, Kenny is my son.

25:09.300 --> 25:11.962
- Oh! Well, that does change
the equation, doesn't it?

25:12.010 --> 25:13.262
- Yes, it does.

25:13.310 --> 25:14.971
He saved me during
the plague,

25:15.010 --> 25:17.206
and when he needed help,
I gave it to him,

25:17.240 --> 25:18.674
and I made
him one of us.

25:18.710 --> 25:19.780
- You call that help?

25:19.810 --> 25:21.744
- You don't understand
the circumstances.

25:21.780 --> 25:23.782
He would've died
if I hadn't helped him,

25:23.820 --> 25:24.844
and I gave him my word

25:24.890 --> 25:26.779
to do whatever it
takes to protect him.

25:26.820 --> 25:29.551
- Now you want me to
give him a pass too?

25:29.590 --> 25:32.082
- He's different! Not--
He's not Bishop!

25:32.130 --> 25:35.623
- Why didn't you tell me this
when I first saw you?

25:35.660 --> 25:38.129
- Because, Suzanna,
I wanted you to know

25:38.170 --> 25:40.764
that I was a different
kind of vampire,

25:40.800 --> 25:43.030
that I'm a little bit
more like you.

25:43.070 --> 25:45.562
And it's a little bit
hard to do that

25:45.610 --> 25:48.773
when I just turned the
next leader of Boston, OK?

25:48.810 --> 25:52.075
- I understand a weakness
for our kids,

25:52.110 --> 25:55.239
but I thought after that
girl, after you dried up,

25:55.280 --> 25:58.341
I thought you were
done with all this.

25:58.390 --> 26:02.054
- The pain that you felt
after killing Isaac.

26:02.090 --> 26:06.084
That never really goes
away completely, does it?

26:06.130 --> 26:07.950
- No.

26:08.000 --> 26:11.026
- Well, then why would
you wish that on me?

26:11.070 --> 26:13.892
Don't ask me to
do that to Kenny.

26:13.940 --> 26:16.989
- You're asking me to look the
other way while people die.

26:17.040 --> 26:19.839
- I didn't know what he was
up to. I really didn't.

26:19.870 --> 26:22.009
So just give me
a chance to rein him in.

26:22.040 --> 26:23.940
- Fine, I'll give
you 2 months.

26:23.980 --> 26:26.972
And I'll have to trust that
you can raise him up

26:27.010 --> 26:28.273
into something decent,

26:28.320 --> 26:31.039
like you would've
with Isaac.

26:31.090 --> 26:32.239
- I will. T will.

26:32.290 --> 26:34.315
- Fine, then I'll back off.

26:34.360 --> 26:36.920
But if you can't
get him under control,

26:36.960 --> 26:39.657
the next time I see you,
you won't see me coming.

26:43.360 --> 26:45.124
(Scoffing)

26:45.170 --> 26:47.696
- So what's next for you?

26:47.740 --> 26:50.198
Hmm?

26:51.670 --> 26:53.900
Are you gonna
stay in Boston?

26:53.940 --> 26:56.272
- No, I think I'll
find some place new.

26:58.410 --> 27:02.040
I was just hoping that next
place might've been with you.

27:14.430 --> 27:17.252
- Oh, hey---hey!
Uh, you got a minute?

27:17.300 --> 27:20.429
- I just--
No, 'cause I'm doing--

27:20.470 --> 27:24.134
- Just kind of need some
impartial advice from a friend.

27:24.170 --> 27:26.901
- OK.

27:28.740 --> 27:31.050
(Grunting)

27:31.080 --> 27:34.141
- What-- Am I crazy to
let Suzanna leave town?

27:34.180 --> 27:37.013
She's the only wife
that I ever had.

27:37.050 --> 27:39.041
- Suzanna's not right for you.

27:39.090 --> 27:41.912
- OK, but what are
the chances, you know,

27:41.960 --> 27:45.021
that someone that you love
that much is gone,

27:45.060 --> 27:46.323
you think for good,

27:46.360 --> 27:48.158
then comes back...

27:48.200 --> 27:50.999
different, but the
connection's still there.

27:51.030 --> 27:54.000
I mean, what do you do?
Do you just let them go?

27:54.040 --> 27:55.929
- No!
- I thought you said Suzanna--

27:55.970 --> 27:59.406
- For the right person, yes,
but Suzanna is not that person.

27:59.440 --> 28:01.704
- OK, well, then who
are we talking about?

28:01.740 --> 28:03.401
Are we talking about,
like, Kat, or...

28:03.440 --> 28:04.805
Not Celine.

28:04.850 --> 28:06.340
- Oh, also not right for you!

28:06.380 --> 28:07.916
- Why not?

28:07.950 --> 28:10.783
- OK, should we take Suzanna?
- Sure!

28:10.820 --> 28:13.858
- She loves you in theory.
- Yes.

28:13.890 --> 28:15.756
- As long as you
never mess up!

28:15.790 --> 28:18.327
She would never put up
with you day to day.

28:18.360 --> 28:20.829
No! Not the real you. No!

28:20.860 --> 28:22.453
- All right,
well, that's true.

28:22.500 --> 28:25.162
- You need someone
who knows that you slip.

28:25.200 --> 28:27.931
- You need someone who knows
that you're not perfect,

28:27.970 --> 28:29.199
but who loves you anyway,

28:29.240 --> 28:31.129
who knows that you'll
get there someday.

28:31.170 --> 28:32.729
One day!

28:34.140 --> 28:35.505
(Scoffing)

28:35.540 --> 28:38.043
- Yeah, there's only
one problem with that.

28:38.080 --> 28:40.071
That woman
doesn't exist.

28:40.110 --> 28:42.169
(Doorbell buzzing)

28:49.290 --> 28:51.384
- You've gotta stop them!
- Astrid?

28:51.430 --> 28:53.797
- They've got Josh.

29:30.870 --> 29:32.895
(Aidan sighing)

29:32.930 --> 29:34.159
- How long has it been?

29:34.200 --> 29:35.235
- Like 15 minutes?

29:35.270 --> 29:36.567
- This is ridiculous.

29:36.600 --> 29:39.035
We never should've let
her go in there alone.

29:39.070 --> 29:41.175
- She'll be back soon.

29:41.210 --> 29:43.372
- I saw Josh. He's in
a cage in the basement.

29:43.410 --> 29:45.242
- Is he OK?

29:45.280 --> 29:47.374
- Uh, he's in a cage
in the basement!

29:47.410 --> 29:49.913
- Right! Is there
anyone else with him?

29:49.950 --> 29:51.987
- No, they just left.
- Where did they go?

29:52.020 --> 29:54.512
- They're showing the new ones
where to turn tomorrow.

29:54.560 --> 29:56.449
It's like a super creepy
college tour.

29:56.490 --> 29:58.857
- Well, are you gonna
show us where Josh is?

29:58.890 --> 29:59.925
- OK, yes!

30:02.430 --> 30:04.296
- Hello?

30:04.330 --> 30:08.369
Can we at least pretend
we run a fake business?

30:10.640 --> 30:13.029
(Rustling)

30:19.350 --> 30:20.977
(Groaning)

30:23.320 --> 30:25.015
You don't
wanna do this.

30:25.050 --> 30:27.348
- Oh, I heard that you
can compel vampires.

30:27.390 --> 30:29.210
That even gave me
a little tingle.

30:29.260 --> 30:30.580
(Gasping)

30:30.620 --> 30:32.554
Looks like the
juniper's working.

30:32.590 --> 30:34.422
- You want
to let me go.

30:34.460 --> 30:35.598
- No, I really don't.

30:40.470 --> 30:43.565
- (Nora):
Oh my God! Josh!

30:43.600 --> 30:46.103
- Hey! You all right, pal?

30:46.140 --> 30:47.665
- Let's get you
out of here.

30:50.640 --> 30:52.904
(Grunting)

30:52.950 --> 30:54.918
- Come on,
come on, come on!

30:54.950 --> 30:57.112
- Come on!
Let's go, man.

30:57.150 --> 31:00.381
- Let's go, Josh.
Come on. We're gonna help you.

31:00.420 --> 31:04.129
- Guys. Guys!

31:04.160 --> 31:07.619
- Oh, you can leave,
but he stays.

31:07.660 --> 31:10.322
- He's coming with us.

31:10.360 --> 31:13.660
- You already left him once.
You know how it's done.

31:13.700 --> 31:16.135
And you picked
the wrong night to cross us.

31:16.170 --> 31:17.592
- Let us leave with him.

31:17.640 --> 31:20.530
- Sorry, he's meeting
his brand new family tomorrow.

31:20.570 --> 31:23.130
- Your wife and daughter
are alive because of him,

31:23.180 --> 31:24.648
and you do this?

31:24.680 --> 31:27.240
- We didn't kick Josh out
for what he is.

31:27.280 --> 31:28.645
You did.
We took him in.

31:28.680 --> 31:31.342
- At least, with
these new wolves,

31:31.390 --> 31:33.484
he'll get the respect
you should've given him.

31:33.520 --> 31:34.681
- We can take them.

31:34.720 --> 31:36.085
- No, Nora, we can't.

31:36.120 --> 31:37.952
I can hear more coming.

31:37.990 --> 31:39.981
Get Josh out of here.

31:41.700 --> 31:44.397
Go, Sally.
- I'm not leaving without you.

31:44.430 --> 31:46.467
- I got this.

31:48.540 --> 31:50.690
- Behind you!
Behind you!

31:50.740 --> 31:52.936
(Groaning)

31:55.280 --> 31:56.600
(Groaning)

32:02.320 --> 32:05.642
- Get out of here, Sally. You
don't wanna see what happens.

32:05.690 --> 32:07.089
- I'm not leaving!

32:08.290 --> 32:09.655
- (Whispering): OK.

32:11.090 --> 32:13.559
(All grunting)

32:13.590 --> 32:15.251
(Groaning)

32:16.560 --> 32:17.994
- No!

32:30.040 --> 32:31.747
- Sally, you need to go.

32:31.780 --> 32:33.145
- I can't!

32:34.780 --> 32:36.145
- I'm gonna enjoy this.

32:36.180 --> 32:38.285
- Nah!

32:38.320 --> 32:39.742
- Hal

32:39.790 --> 32:43.488
(All grunting)

32:44.790 --> 32:47.225
- Hit him, hit him, hit him!

32:47.260 --> 32:50.025
(Groaning)

32:50.060 --> 32:51.221
Hit me!

32:55.740 --> 32:57.435
(Groaning)

32:57.470 --> 32:59.302
(Grunting)

33:00.510 --> 33:02.729
- Get down!

33:02.780 --> 33:05.101
Get up!

33:05.150 --> 33:07.710
Sally, no more possessing!
I'm serious!

33:07.750 --> 33:09.070
(Grunting)

33:09.120 --> 33:10.440
(Whooshing)

33:10.480 --> 33:12.482
- Hi!

33:18.130 --> 33:21.521
- You know what?

33:21.560 --> 33:24.097
- Hey, hey, hey!
I can handle one guy!

33:24.130 --> 33:29.193
- I know you can. I know.
I just-- This one's for me.

33:29.240 --> 33:31.459
(Whooshing)

33:31.510 --> 33:33.467
- Come on! You know
what it does to you!

33:33.510 --> 33:34.500
What are you doing?

33:34.540 --> 33:36.338
- I need a body.
- Why?

33:36.380 --> 33:40.078
- To remind you of this.

33:40.110 --> 33:44.513
(* Lost by The Mary Onenettes *)

33:44.550 --> 33:49.090
** There's nothing
I can do to heal you *

33:49.120 --> 33:51.487
* If you let it all begin *

33:51.530 --> 33:56.252
* There's nothing
I can do to please you *

33:56.300 --> 33:58.621
* If I could run... **

33:58.670 --> 34:00.798
- Please tell me
you remember.

34:00.830 --> 34:03.231
- That was, uh...

34:03.270 --> 34:05.432
Confusing.

34:05.470 --> 34:06.767
- Amazing!

34:06.810 --> 34:08.369
- Have we done that before?

34:08.409 --> 34:10.174
(Stammering)

34:10.210 --> 34:11.245
- Now hit me.

34:11.280 --> 34:13.100
Punch me in the face!

34:13.150 --> 34:15.847
- I can't hit a girl,
not after that.

34:15.880 --> 34:17.245
- Oh really?

34:19.590 --> 34:20.648
You have to.

34:20.690 --> 34:22.317
- OK.

34:29.300 --> 34:31.166
(Panting)

34:31.199 --> 34:33.123
So, um...

34:33.170 --> 34:35.559
- Yeah, we gotta go.
- OK.

34:35.600 --> 34:37.159
(Panting)

34:43.739 --> 34:46.175
- Hey, uh, we gonna
talk about this?

34:46.210 --> 34:47.746
- Yes. Yes, let's
talk about it.

34:49.179 --> 34:50.614
Let's talk about it.

34:50.650 --> 34:52.186
- OK, first question:

34:52.219 --> 34:54.518
Was that you or
was that the dude?

34:54.560 --> 34:55.880
(Laughing)

34:55.920 --> 34:58.321
(Panting)

34:58.360 --> 34:59.521
- OK.

34:59.560 --> 35:02.154
- Hey! Hey, sweetheart,
we gotta get you home.

35:02.200 --> 35:04.623
- (Panting): No, just wait.
Let's talk about it.

35:04.670 --> 35:06.229
- No, you're glowing, Sally.

35:06.270 --> 35:07.863
- Well, it was
a really good kiss!

35:07.900 --> 35:10.790
- No, I mean that your skin--
It was a very good Kiss.

35:10.840 --> 35:12.262
It was a great
kiss. Um, I--

35:12.310 --> 35:13.266
(Buzzing)

35:13.310 --> 35:14.277
- What? What is it?

35:14.310 --> 35:15.630
- I don't know,
I don't know!

35:15.680 --> 35:18.502
- Really? You're reading
that right now?

35:18.550 --> 35:20.177
- It's nothing.

35:20.210 --> 35:22.747
- Even with 200 years of
experience, you're a bad liar.

35:22.780 --> 35:24.487
- Ha ha!
Just give me a second.

35:24.520 --> 35:26.249
- Just go. I'll meet
you at home.

35:26.290 --> 35:27.382
- No, I'm just gonna--

35:30.190 --> 35:33.490
(Car honking)

35:33.530 --> 35:36.249
- Wow! Just one little
text is all that took.

35:36.300 --> 35:39.668
You're much more responsive
to this one than to me.

35:39.700 --> 35:42.635
- What happened to giving me
2 months to rein him in?

35:42.670 --> 35:45.162
- That's an oddly specific
timeframe, right?

35:45.210 --> 35:46.507
I find it helps with lies.

35:46.540 --> 35:48.872
- Please, let him go.

35:48.910 --> 35:51.607
- I killed our
own perfect child.

35:51.650 --> 35:53.744
What makes you think
I'm gonna let this live.

35:53.780 --> 35:55.646
(Sighing)

35:55.680 --> 35:57.614
- Suzanna...

35:58.990 --> 35:59.946
Don't do this.

35:59.990 --> 36:01.913
I told you that
he is my son,

36:01.960 --> 36:03.655
because I wanted
you to understand

36:03.690 --> 36:05.522
I can't let
anything happen to him.

36:05.560 --> 36:08.200
- What, like I didn't
already know that?

36:08.230 --> 36:10.449
- And you ask me
to do that anyway?

36:10.500 --> 36:11.922
- Because he's
not your son!

36:11.970 --> 36:14.769
You had a son.

36:14.800 --> 36:18.236
I wanted to be
wrong about you.

36:18.270 --> 36:21.274
I wanted to believe
that deep in your core,

36:21.310 --> 36:25.440
there was some small shred
of that good man that I loved.

36:25.480 --> 36:28.313
- Suzanna, there is
and you know that.

36:28.350 --> 36:31.240
- No, there's not.
Not anymore.

36:31.290 --> 36:33.679
Not after everything
that you've done.

36:33.720 --> 36:36.280
- Everything that I've done?

36:36.320 --> 36:39.449
No, uh-uh. Suzanna,
I don't believe you.

36:39.490 --> 36:43.723
You knew all about my reputation
before you set foot in Boston.

36:43.760 --> 36:46.866
And when I rattled off all of
those horrible, awful things

36:46.900 --> 36:48.493
that I did to my victims,

36:48.540 --> 36:52.363
if you were truly shocked, you
would've ended me right there.

36:52.410 --> 36:54.606
But you didn't.
You let me live! Why?

36:54.640 --> 36:56.972
- To give you a chance
to make it right,

36:57.010 --> 36:58.546
to kill your boy here.

36:58.580 --> 37:01.845
- You don't care about
everyone that I've killed.

37:01.880 --> 37:05.589
The thing that you can't get
past is the one that you killed.

37:05.620 --> 37:08.681
But that wasn't your fault.
It was Bishop's.

37:08.720 --> 37:12.327
He made you what you are,
just like I made Kenny!

37:12.360 --> 37:15.694
But this isn't about him,
and it isn't about me.

37:15.730 --> 37:16.891
- It is about you.

37:16.930 --> 37:18.625
- No, it's about Isaac,

37:18.670 --> 37:22.038
and it has always
been about Isaac.

37:22.070 --> 37:25.040
All I did was
forgive you.

37:25.070 --> 37:26.333
That's what you hate.

37:26.370 --> 37:29.032
And I do. Suzanna,
I forgive you.

37:29.080 --> 37:30.673
(Groaning)

37:30.710 --> 37:32.804
- Isaac was our child.
We were his parents!

37:32.850 --> 37:35.273
We are supposed
to protect him!

37:38.750 --> 37:39.911
(Aidan groaning)

37:39.950 --> 37:42.419
- You did your best
to protect him,

37:42.460 --> 37:43.689
and I forgive you.

37:43.720 --> 37:46.690
(Groaning)

37:46.730 --> 37:48.721
- This is your son?

37:48.760 --> 37:51.422
This is your son. I want
you to know how this feels.

37:53.030 --> 37:54.293
(Gasping)

37:54.340 --> 37:55.136
(Grunting)

37:58.100 --> 37:59.408
- It wasn't your fault.

37:59.440 --> 38:00.760
- Stop staying that!

38:00.810 --> 38:01.834
- Forgive yourself,

38:01.880 --> 38:03.632
- Don't tell me
how to grieve!

38:03.680 --> 38:04.704
- Forgive yourself,

38:08.820 --> 38:11.710
(Isaac crying)

38:18.960 --> 38:19.950
- No!

38:19.990 --> 38:22.027
(Gasping)

38:28.900 --> 38:30.698
- Forgive yourself,

38:34.640 --> 38:36.005
(Groaning)

38:45.390 --> 38:47.848
(Door opening, Aidan grunting)

38:49.890 --> 38:51.927
- Where did you go?

38:51.960 --> 38:53.826
(Sighing)

38:53.860 --> 38:55.794
- It was a long night.

38:57.630 --> 38:59.826
How are they?

38:59.870 --> 39:02.737
- Josh is
upstairs sleeping.

39:04.670 --> 39:06.399
Sally's...

39:08.010 --> 39:09.808
- Oh no!

39:09.840 --> 39:10.932
Oh no,
no, no, no!

39:10.980 --> 39:12.869
How long has she
been like this?

39:12.910 --> 39:15.447
- Almost since
she got back.

39:15.480 --> 39:18.381
I think she was keeping a lid
on it, so you wouldn't worry.

39:18.420 --> 39:20.514
- OK, she's gonna
bounce back, right?

39:20.550 --> 39:22.757
She always bounces back.

39:27.160 --> 39:29.026
(Sighing)

39:29.060 --> 39:31.791
Sally, you're gonna be OK.
You gotta be.

39:35.170 --> 39:37.832
(Sighing)

39:45.450 --> 39:47.976
What did you
want me to remember?

39:52.520 --> 39:56.115
You helped me, Sally.

39:57.520 --> 39:59.454
You always help me.

40:15.080 --> 40:17.469
I never should've
let her stay.

40:18.680 --> 40:20.739
- She wanted to help.

40:20.780 --> 40:22.475
- I told her not
to possess wolves.

40:22.520 --> 40:25.512
She knows what it does to her,
and I told her to leave.

40:25.550 --> 40:26.711
(Groaning)

40:26.750 --> 40:28.855
- She was never
gonna leave you.

40:28.890 --> 40:32.190
- Yeah, but why would
she do something so stupid?

40:32.230 --> 40:34.653
(Sighing)

40:34.700 --> 40:38.466
- Because she's in love
with you, you dummy.

40:38.500 --> 40:40.491
(Scoffing)

40:41.900 --> 40:44.665
You think Sally's been
acting weird around you

40:44.710 --> 40:45.905
since she's been back?

40:47.140 --> 40:49.131
She has.

40:50.880 --> 40:54.510
Because in that other life,
you and Sally were in love.

41:04.930 --> 41:06.523
(Exhaling sharply)

41:10.000 --> 41:12.628
- Well, why wouldn't
she tell me?

41:13.830 --> 41:16.140
- We have to make sure
she gets better

41:16.170 --> 41:18.036
so she can tell you herself.

41:18.070 --> 41:20.539
- I will.

41:20.570 --> 41:23.938
I would do
anything for her.

41:23.980 --> 41:28.076
** This is the beat
when my heart stopped *

41:30.150 --> 41:33.586
* And now you've
got me reeling *

41:33.620 --> 41:37.557
* And every time
you turn to me *

41:48.230 --> 41:52.838
* And then I gotta breathe
and breathe and breathe *

41:52.870 --> 41:57.307
* And then I gotta breathe
and breathe and breathe *

41:57.340 --> 42:00.878
* And then I gotta breathe
and breathe and breathe... *

42:00.910 --> 42:02.844
- (Echoing):
No, let me go!

42:07.050 --> 42:08.040
* And breathe *

42:08.090 --> 42:09.854
* And breathe and breathe *

42:09.890 --> 42:13.554

and breathe and breathe... *

when my heart stopped *

42:20.970 --> 42:25.760

* And when you turn
your head to me **
