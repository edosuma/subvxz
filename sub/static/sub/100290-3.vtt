00:07.040 --> 00:11.560
A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

00:21.000 --> 00:22.840
<i>A night of samba and </i>caipirinha

00:22.920 --> 00:25.440
<i>helped the players</i>
<i>get over Ana Carla's exit.</i>

00:25.520 --> 00:27.200
I'm getting goosebumps, man.

00:27.280 --> 00:28.640
Party time in <i>The Circle.</i>

00:30.040 --> 00:32.600
<i>While they got into the Carnival spirit,</i>

00:32.680 --> 00:36.200
<i>two new players snuck into </i>The Circle.

00:36.680 --> 00:38.840
-Wonder Twin powers...
-Activate.

00:40.480 --> 00:42.520
Hi, I'm... I don't need to say hi.

00:43.760 --> 00:45.920
-I'm Lucas.
-I'm Marcel.

00:46.000 --> 00:47.760
-I'm 30 years old.
-Me too.

00:47.840 --> 00:49.640
-I'm from Rio Branco, Acre.
-Me too.

00:49.720 --> 00:51.040
We're twins.

00:53.240 --> 00:56.600
I'm the older twin, so I'm more of a boss.

00:56.680 --> 00:58.720
-Bullshit.
-I knew he wouldn't agree.

00:58.800 --> 01:00.760
I'm younger and more responsible.

01:00.840 --> 01:02.680
Lucas has just came out as gay.

01:02.760 --> 01:04.480
He came out as gay at birth.

01:05.840 --> 01:07.520
Picture twins living together.

01:07.600 --> 01:09.280
We share a bedroom, a car...

01:09.360 --> 01:11.040
-Clothes.
-Clothes, to this day.

01:11.120 --> 01:12.080
We end up fighting.

01:12.160 --> 01:15.000
Now Lucas lives in São Paulo,
and I live in Rio Branco.

01:15.080 --> 01:18.840
When you're apart,
you start becoming your own person.

01:18.920 --> 01:20.640
I kinda miss it. And you?

01:20.720 --> 01:22.120
Oh... I don't.

01:24.200 --> 01:27.080
Us living together again... Oh, my God.

01:27.160 --> 01:30.200
There will be two games:
<i>The Circle</i> and<i> Lucas and Marcel.</i>

01:31.440 --> 01:32.880
What about our profile?

01:32.960 --> 01:35.760
We'll be a new person.
It can't be Lucas or Marcel.

01:35.840 --> 01:37.160
We've combined both.

01:37.240 --> 01:39.440
-Together, we are Lu...
-...ma.

01:39.520 --> 01:40.400
Luma!

01:40.480 --> 01:42.000
So creative.

01:45.640 --> 01:48.000
Friendly, outgoing.

01:48.080 --> 01:50.720
Smoking hot!

01:52.680 --> 01:56.600
Luma represents Lucas's heart
and Marcel's mind.

01:56.680 --> 01:59.120
Aw, that is so romantic.

02:02.640 --> 02:05.680
-Luma is from Acre. Luma is real.
-The real deal.

02:05.760 --> 02:06.800
The real deal!

02:15.080 --> 02:16.640
Whoa!

02:16.720 --> 02:19.520
"Welcome to <i>The Circle."</i>

02:20.680 --> 02:21.800
Thank you.

02:23.200 --> 02:24.520
"Set up your profile."

02:24.600 --> 02:26.280
It's about to start.

02:27.880 --> 02:30.040
Lucas plus Marcel equals Luma.

02:30.120 --> 02:32.000
Let's select a photo.

02:33.600 --> 02:35.000
She's so pretty.

02:35.080 --> 02:36.960
Open "Selfies" album.

02:39.880 --> 02:42.600
The wonderful girl in the photos
is Juciane.

02:42.680 --> 02:44.920
Miss Acre, influencer.

02:46.000 --> 02:48.280
Her story is very similar to ours.

02:48.360 --> 02:50.000
We could be triplets.

02:50.080 --> 02:52.520
A profile picture should show your face.

02:52.600 --> 02:54.800
-Check another album.
-Open "Hobbies."

02:57.960 --> 03:00.520
Cool. I like her in black.

03:01.840 --> 03:04.320
See? From that photo, we can say

03:04.400 --> 03:05.880
that she's happy.

03:06.280 --> 03:08.880
It shows nature, something lively.

03:08.960 --> 03:10.560
-Her beauty.
-It's spontaneous.

03:11.120 --> 03:12.800
Everything is well balanced.

03:13.720 --> 03:14.600
That's the one.

03:16.560 --> 03:18.640
It looks great.

03:18.720 --> 03:20.160
Luma's age?

03:20.240 --> 03:21.840
She's 27 years old.

03:21.920 --> 03:24.560
"Relationship status." Single.

03:24.840 --> 03:26.600
"Tell us about yourself..."

03:27.160 --> 03:29.800
-I'm a proud Acre native.
-Let go!

03:30.440 --> 03:34.680
I was raised eating <i>tacacá</i> and <i>açaí.</i>
Advertiser and digital influencer.

03:35.880 --> 03:36.720
Period.

03:36.800 --> 03:38.280
-Now, her personality.
-Okay.

03:38.960 --> 03:39.880
Joyful.

03:39.960 --> 03:41.800
Maybe, no bad vibes?

03:41.880 --> 03:43.720
Don't even start with that.

03:43.800 --> 03:45.040
Joyful,

03:45.120 --> 03:46.200
chatty,

03:46.720 --> 03:48.840
stubborn, and indecisive.

03:48.920 --> 03:50.360
A typical Libra.

03:50.440 --> 03:53.520
#DontPullMyExtensions.

03:54.800 --> 03:56.840
-It's great, don't you think?
-Of course.

03:56.920 --> 03:59.200
Circle, post our profile.

04:02.840 --> 04:04.600
<i>The profile is set.</i>

04:04.680 --> 04:05.800
What could this be?

04:05.880 --> 04:06.960
What do you think?

04:07.040 --> 04:08.080
Alcohol.

04:08.160 --> 04:11.840
<i>-All they need now is a fierce look.</i>
-Hi, Luma!

04:11.920 --> 04:13.720
Oh, my God!

04:14.000 --> 04:15.320
<i>A glamorous makeup.</i>

04:15.400 --> 04:18.320
We look so trashy.

04:18.400 --> 04:22.040
<i>And Luma is ready to shine</i>
<i>in </i>The Circle's<i> party.</i>

04:22.120 --> 04:24.320
The party is about to start.

04:26.200 --> 04:28.520
<i>Let's dance</i>

04:29.360 --> 04:32.120
Who wants to lose energy? Not me.

04:38.080 --> 04:41.360
-Yeah!
-Fuck yeah!

04:41.840 --> 04:44.360
Turn it up!

04:49.000 --> 04:50.320
Swag...

04:58.960 --> 05:00.520
I'm going to the dance floor.

05:02.320 --> 05:04.480
Thank you very much. You're welcome.

05:05.960 --> 05:08.640
-Whoa!
-"Circle Chat

05:08.720 --> 05:12.040
is now open!"

05:13.120 --> 05:14.760
Circle, open chat.

05:15.960 --> 05:19.520
Let's see what they're talking
about the costumes, the music...

05:19.600 --> 05:20.920
CIRCLE CHAT

05:21.000 --> 05:21.920
"The Circle.

05:22.000 --> 05:24.280
Select your best Carnival picture..."

05:24.360 --> 05:27.160
"...and post it to the Circle Chat."

05:28.760 --> 05:30.760
Do I have a good Carnival picture?

05:30.840 --> 05:34.720
<i>If you think that's hard,</i>
<i>imagine how hard it is for a catfish.</i>

05:34.800 --> 05:38.080
Dude, Lucas doesn't really care
about Carnival.

05:38.640 --> 05:41.680
Loma, on the other hand,
as soon as she hears...

05:45.160 --> 05:46.480
She immediately dresses up.

05:46.560 --> 05:49.520
Circle, open my photos.

05:50.560 --> 05:53.480
Select the one from the festival.

05:53.560 --> 05:56.200

05:56.280 --> 05:58.120
Send the photo and the hashtag.

05:59.920 --> 06:02.160
You mean, "Thor-rible."

06:02.240 --> 06:03.560

06:03.640 --> 06:06.320
Wow. Check him out.

06:09.920 --> 06:10.960
Send.

06:13.720 --> 06:15.720
There's nothing we can do, girl.

06:15.800 --> 06:18.280
That's life, unfortunately.

06:18.360 --> 06:21.560
Lucas, I still want you, okay?
Don't be pissed at me.

06:22.320 --> 06:26.360
I have a feeling that Lucas is shallow,
and he's a mystery to me.

06:27.200 --> 06:28.760
I don't really trust him.

06:29.560 --> 06:32.760
<i>While the players post Carnival pictures,</i>

06:33.320 --> 06:36.240
<i>what does our new player think about them?</i>

06:36.800 --> 06:37.680
Lucas!

06:37.760 --> 06:39.280
He likes to drink.

06:39.360 --> 06:40.600
Luma has a friend.

06:40.680 --> 06:43.080
"Be focused, be strong, have faith." Geez!

06:43.640 --> 06:44.520
Pass.

06:44.600 --> 06:47.320
Let's enjoy life. He's a surfer.

06:48.600 --> 06:51.640

So pretty.

07:25.680 --> 07:28.360
"Small-town, chatty princess."

07:29.000 --> 07:31.800
Another chatty girl?
There's no room for two.

07:31.880 --> 07:35.600
"Wannabe model. Likes to party."

07:36.920 --> 07:38.440
Circle, message.

07:38.520 --> 07:41.080
I'm buying a farm right now.

07:41.160 --> 07:42.320
LOL.

07:42.400 --> 07:46.040
Everybody's flirting with everybody.
I can't compete.

07:46.120 --> 07:49.480
You can't shoot in every direction.

07:49.560 --> 07:52.720
You will run out of bullets
and won't hit anyone.

07:52.800 --> 07:55.040
Fuck, which one should I choose?

07:55.920 --> 07:57.760
Select the first one.

07:57.840 --> 08:01.920

08:11.800 --> 08:13.920
Circle, message.

08:14.000 --> 08:18.000
So is that your player two?

08:18.080 --> 08:19.440
Send.

08:21.480 --> 08:24.440
My player two is way prettier.
She's much cuter.

08:24.880 --> 08:27.240
"Gaybol." Funny name.

08:27.320 --> 08:29.240
"I love video games." He's a nerd.

08:29.320 --> 08:30.280
Next.

08:30.360 --> 08:33.120
Circle, open my album.

08:33.200 --> 08:35.800

08:40.920 --> 08:42.240
Oh, wow.

08:42.640 --> 08:46.280
Cute, but not as much
as in his profile picture.

08:46.360 --> 08:48.200
He tried to fool us.

08:48.280 --> 08:49.800
Circle, message.

08:49.880 --> 08:53.360
I could use a firefighter

He's 28, "actively looking."
He's a manwhore.

09:04.960 --> 09:07.160
Stereotypical straight guy.

09:07.240 --> 09:10.400
See what a photo can do?

09:10.480 --> 09:13.600
Circle, the one I'm wearing a hat.

I'm keeping my eyes on you.

09:30.480 --> 09:32.280
Are you trying to trick me?

09:33.480 --> 09:35.040
He's a doctor, a dietician.

09:35.120 --> 09:38.040
Luma can talk to him
because she's a Libra.

09:38.120 --> 09:40.320
It's a conversation starter.

09:40.400 --> 09:42.920
Circle, message.

09:43.000 --> 09:47.080
Akel, how come you want to create
a Carnival group chat?

You don't even have a photo.

He's an artist.

10:21.200 --> 10:23.200
He seems very lively.

10:23.280 --> 10:25.320
He seems the type of guy who fights

10:25.400 --> 10:27.240
-for LGBT rights.
-For the gays.

What the fuck?

12:04.320 --> 12:05.320
Who is Luma?

12:05.400 --> 12:07.920
Don't tell me there's a new player.

12:08.000 --> 12:09.960
Did I drink too much?

12:10.040 --> 12:11.800
Where did she come from?

12:11.880 --> 12:12.840
What?

12:12.920 --> 12:14.080
I don't get it.

12:14.160 --> 12:15.480
Luma has arrived.

12:17.720 --> 12:18.920
And stomping.

12:19.000 --> 12:21.640
Circle, open Luma's photo.

12:22.960 --> 12:25.040
Holy shit!

12:25.120 --> 12:27.320
I'm shocked.

12:27.400 --> 12:30.560
Everything is going well,

12:30.640 --> 12:33.200
and <i>The Circle</i> brings another player.

12:33.280 --> 12:36.600
Giving her clothes and the hashtags,

12:36.680 --> 12:38.280
is she a trans woman?

12:39.440 --> 12:40.320
It looks like it.

12:40.400 --> 12:41.920
Circle, message.

12:42.000 --> 12:43.960
Yes!

12:44.040 --> 12:48.680

13:06.880 --> 13:10.320
Luma, it's really great
to have a trans person...

13:10.400 --> 13:11.840
"...here with us.

13:11.920 --> 13:15.960
We needed that side of reality in here.

13:16.040 --> 13:19.000
Welcome. You can count on Auntie.

13:19.080 --> 13:20.920
I hope I didn't get it wrong."

13:21.000 --> 13:24.120
Oh, but you did, honey.

Trans?

13:30.880 --> 13:32.160
Julia.

13:32.240 --> 13:33.920

13:52.480 --> 13:53.880
I certainly will.

13:53.960 --> 13:56.960
That's so cool.
She came in with a bang, dude.

13:57.040 --> 13:59.200
Luma's first message.

13:59.280 --> 14:02.000
She nailed it.

14:02.400 --> 14:05.600
Excellent profile.
Congratulations to us.

14:08.480 --> 14:10.440
Let's get to know Luma.

Hell yeah!

It's a really great photo. Oh, my God.

14:27.200 --> 14:31.000
"I'm a proud Acre native."

14:31.080 --> 14:34.320
Nice! We needed people from the north.

14:53.280 --> 14:54.160
Very nice.

14:54.240 --> 14:57.240
She gave us another hint.
She wears weaves.

14:57.880 --> 15:01.760
She didn't say anything about her gender,

15:01.840 --> 15:04.320
whether she's a trans or not.
What's her deal?

15:04.400 --> 15:08.240
Where did Julia got the idea
that she's trans?

15:08.320 --> 15:10.840
She doesn't look like a trans.

15:10.920 --> 15:14.200
I think Ju got it wrong.

15:14.280 --> 15:16.320
And even if she is, who cares?

15:16.400 --> 15:18.760
She seems brave.

15:19.040 --> 15:20.120
She might be...

15:20.200 --> 15:22.600
...a fierce competitor.

15:22.680 --> 15:24.640
Is this her real profile?

15:25.200 --> 15:28.080
Is Luma real?

Holy mother of God!
I'm not dressed for this moment.

I'm not ready yet, guys.

15:48.200 --> 15:51.880
If he's a catfish,
he's probably shitting his pants.

15:51.960 --> 15:54.800
What if I start asking him

15:54.880 --> 15:57.640
about skeletal muscle,
and he doesn't know anything?

15:57.720 --> 15:58.960
He'll be in trouble.

15:59.040 --> 16:03.240
Circle, open private chat with Lorayne.

16:10.640 --> 16:12.960
So, did you also have a hard time

16:13.520 --> 16:16.080
in Anatomy class? Question mark.

16:16.160 --> 16:19.760
I study Physical Therapy,

16:28.240 --> 16:31.280
No, she studies Physical Therapy.
Circle, message.

16:31.360 --> 16:34.320
So does that mean
you work in healthcare too?

16:34.400 --> 16:36.640
I did well in the beginning.

16:37.120 --> 16:38.680
The hardest part

16:39.000 --> 16:40.280
was the internship.

16:40.360 --> 16:43.240
"I started being at call." Internship?

16:43.880 --> 16:46.000
"At call?" You mean, "on call."

16:46.080 --> 16:47.920
I'm pretty sure she'll buy that.

16:48.000 --> 16:50.520
She'll be like,
"Wow, he really is a doctor.

16:50.600 --> 16:54.080
When somebody claims they're a doctor,
they gotta know about internships."

16:54.640 --> 16:57.720
So does that mean you know

16:57.800 --> 17:00.680
where my sternocleidomastoid muscle is?

17:00.760 --> 17:05.360
"...sternocleidomasteoid muscle is?
You can give it a kiss."

17:05.440 --> 17:07.720
Holy, what's that?

17:10.800 --> 17:12.520
Circle, message.

17:13.560 --> 17:15.920
The big question is,

17:16.000 --> 17:18.200
will we have our classes...

17:18.280 --> 17:20.680
"...in my home or yours?"

17:20.760 --> 17:23.400
Holy. I nailed it.

17:23.480 --> 17:25.160
He didn't say anything

17:25.640 --> 17:28.320
regarding the muscle.

17:28.720 --> 17:32.200
What a slippery brat!

17:32.280 --> 17:33.400
Circle, message.

17:33.480 --> 17:37.240
Since we know a little about anatomy,

17:37.320 --> 17:41.400
and since we're into signs and partying,

17:41.480 --> 17:43.560
marriage is the only step left.

17:43.640 --> 17:46.680
Where will we go on our honeymoon?
#CaribbeanLove.

17:46.760 --> 17:49.920
That place is amazing.
Never been there, but I've seen photos.

17:50.000 --> 17:51.320
Okay.

17:51.400 --> 17:53.280

I think I'm in a relationship now.

18:07.240 --> 18:09.320
I think I have a girlfriend.

18:11.720 --> 18:13.280
Lolo, if you're a catfish,

18:13.360 --> 18:16.080
I'll get really depressed when I find out.

18:16.640 --> 18:20.240
<i>I can't wait to see you</i>

18:20.320 --> 18:22.840

Good night to us.

Carnival is over.

18:31.800 --> 18:34.920
I have to get rid of this glitter.
I don't know how.

18:35.000 --> 18:39.720
I'm the true image of a terrible hangover.

18:42.760 --> 18:44.360
Bye, bitch.

What's the deal with Luma?

18:50.080 --> 18:53.400
<i>I guess somebody</i>
<i>won't let Marina sleep tonight.</i>

19:02.480 --> 19:05.000
What a good night's sleep.

19:05.080 --> 19:07.000
Good morning, Circle!

19:07.080 --> 19:10.320
Good morning, Circle.

19:11.080 --> 19:12.760
Ouch, I even broke the bed.

19:13.720 --> 19:16.040
I'm beat.

19:19.600 --> 19:21.680
It's full again. Nine people.

19:23.360 --> 19:27.280
Actually, everybody was too nice to Luma.

19:27.360 --> 19:28.640
I'm a little suspicious.

19:28.720 --> 19:29.920
Let's see if she's nice.

19:30.000 --> 19:32.680
I have a feeling we'll be friends.

19:32.760 --> 19:34.000
Just kidding.

19:34.080 --> 19:36.040
Man, Luma's arrival...

19:36.800 --> 19:38.280
was controversial.

19:38.360 --> 19:42.040
The only problem was... Julia.

19:42.120 --> 19:44.680
Julia made that comment...

19:44.760 --> 19:45.600
It was terrible.

19:46.520 --> 19:50.120
I can't stop thinking
about her being trans, man.

19:51.040 --> 19:53.600
"Come with Auntie." Auntie's crazy.

19:54.560 --> 19:57.440
I'm excited. It's finally time.

Wow, they've created a group

21:02.880 --> 21:04.520
Whoa, naughty boy.

21:04.600 --> 21:07.000
All I'm seeing, Duma,

I've marked my territory. I've peed on it.

21:37.680 --> 21:39.880
Dumaresq, did you run away from them?

Almost...

21:59.720 --> 22:02.360
"...ninety percent of what you say

He doesn't care if she's gonna be mad.

If Auntie only wants to talk about men,

what's the big deal?

22:21.920 --> 22:24.760

23:28.120 --> 23:30.160
Nice. She answered.

She's a woman, not a trans.

23:35.080 --> 23:37.160
Is that gonna affect your life somehow?

23:37.240 --> 23:38.320
That hurts.

23:38.400 --> 23:40.480
These kinds of questions are uncalled-for.

23:40.560 --> 23:43.640
The answer won't make a difference.

23:43.720 --> 23:45.920
Circle, message.

23:46.000 --> 23:49.400
Julia, if our birth certificate

23:49.480 --> 23:52.360
could tell exactly how we feel,

23:52.440 --> 23:53.360
comma,

23:53.440 --> 23:56.760
mine wouldn't have #man...

23:56.840 --> 23:58.080
"...but #gay instead.

23:58.160 --> 24:01.520
Bodies and souls are free."

24:01.600 --> 24:04.280
Dude, he nailed it.

24:04.360 --> 24:06.960
Dumaresq is jumping down Julia's throat.

24:07.040 --> 24:08.920
I think he doesn't like Auntie.

24:09.000 --> 24:10.760
Circle, message.

24:10.840 --> 24:13.520
Girls, it was great talking to you.

24:13.840 --> 24:16.800
Dumaresq, thank you for inviting me.

24:17.360 --> 24:18.240
Send.

24:19.040 --> 24:22.240
Auntie got slapped in the face
and is thanking him?

24:25.960 --> 24:28.160
That chat was a little glimpse

24:28.240 --> 24:30.680
of what's going on.

24:30.760 --> 24:33.680
Dumaresq has attacked Julia twice.

24:33.760 --> 24:36.320
This is gonna result in a fight later.

24:39.200 --> 24:41.000
<i>Here, you can't be tired.</i>

24:41.080 --> 24:43.560
<i>If you blink, you might miss something.</i>

24:44.400 --> 24:45.400
Yo!

24:45.800 --> 24:47.160
"Let's Dance?"

24:48.160 --> 24:49.000
Nice!

24:50.000 --> 24:53.960
"It's time to find out
who owns the dance floor."

24:54.680 --> 24:57.240
"Our new player Luma will perform..."

24:57.320 --> 24:59.200
"...different dance styles."

24:59.280 --> 25:02.520
Wow, this is a complete look.

25:02.600 --> 25:05.200
You do the dancing
because you know how to dance.

25:05.280 --> 25:08.400
You're gonna kill it.

25:09.320 --> 25:13.320
"Each round, a player
will try to guess a dance style."

25:13.400 --> 25:14.360
Dang.

25:15.160 --> 25:17.760
"The players who get it right
will receive a reward."

25:17.840 --> 25:19.760
Some moves are ridiculous.

25:20.600 --> 25:22.240
Women don't do those, you know?

25:22.800 --> 25:25.640
<i>Will Luma be able to hide the fact</i>
<i>that she's a catfish?</i>

25:26.200 --> 25:28.680
"JP will try to guess in this round."

25:28.760 --> 25:30.160
Am I the first one?

25:30.240 --> 25:32.240
How are we gonna see her dancing?

25:33.560 --> 25:35.240
"What dance style is this?"

25:35.320 --> 25:37.840
Let's see Luma perform.

25:38.880 --> 25:40.880
"The dance style is ballet."

25:45.200 --> 25:46.280
What's that?

25:49.000 --> 25:51.400
What is she doing, dude?

25:51.480 --> 25:53.320
Very feminine, delicate.

25:54.320 --> 25:56.400
Spin on your toes.

26:00.120 --> 26:01.160
Spin.

26:01.720 --> 26:02.960
This is ballet.

26:03.040 --> 26:05.080
Circle, message.

26:05.160 --> 26:06.320
Ballet.

26:06.720 --> 26:07.560
Send.

26:08.120 --> 26:09.640
JP said ballet.

26:10.960 --> 26:12.680
Nice, dude! Very nice!

26:13.400 --> 26:16.000
"Circle. The answer is correct."

26:16.080 --> 26:17.800
Nice!

26:17.880 --> 26:19.480
Clap, clap, clap.

26:20.400 --> 26:23.760
"Lucas will try to guess in this round."

26:23.840 --> 26:26.000
Bring on. Daddy is ready.

26:26.920 --> 26:28.960
"What dance style is this?"
Here she comes.

26:29.040 --> 26:31.920
I wanna see the princess dance. <i>"Frevo!"</i>

26:35.400 --> 26:37.880
Shit, dude. What's that?

26:40.160 --> 26:42.200
That's a lot of footwork.

26:42.280 --> 26:43.680
Maybe it's <i>frevo?</i>

26:43.760 --> 26:45.240
Work on your waist.

26:45.960 --> 26:47.120
I'm going to try.

26:47.200 --> 26:49.720
Circle, <i>frevo?</i>

26:50.360 --> 26:52.120
<i>"Frevo."</i> It isn't <i>frevo.</i>

26:52.200 --> 26:54.440
Lucas guessed <i>frevo!</i> Nice, dude!

26:54.520 --> 26:57.160
"The answer is... correct!"

26:57.240 --> 26:59.680
He guessed it right! Well done!

26:59.760 --> 27:03.760
"Marina will try to guess in this round."

27:04.560 --> 27:06.120
"Belly dance."

27:11.880 --> 27:12.840
What's that?

27:12.920 --> 27:13.920
Mambo?

27:14.000 --> 27:16.640
Seductive hands.

27:16.720 --> 27:18.280
Very delicate.

27:18.360 --> 27:21.120
She's dancing...

27:21.200 --> 27:22.920
Easy. Belly dance.

27:24.680 --> 27:25.920

27:26.000 --> 27:27.280
Belly dance.

THE ANSWER IS CORRECT

27:28.840 --> 27:30.240
Nice one, girl!

27:30.320 --> 27:31.800
Yes, girl!

27:32.600 --> 27:35.040
My turn. Dance your heart out, Luma.

27:35.600 --> 27:38.800
"The dance style is <i>sofrência."</i>

27:40.960 --> 27:43.080
Hey, I know those moves.

27:43.160 --> 27:45.440
It's either <i>forró</i> or tango.

27:45.520 --> 27:46.880
Suffer.

27:46.960 --> 27:48.440
It can only be <i>forró.</i>

27:48.520 --> 27:50.440
Maybe it's <i>xote?</i>

27:50.520 --> 27:51.760
Circle, message.

27:51.840 --> 27:54.400
<i>"Xote."</i> Give him thumbs down.

27:55.520 --> 27:56.360
I got it wrong.

27:56.440 --> 27:58.600
Two to the left, two to the right.

28:00.000 --> 28:01.160
What the hell?

28:01.240 --> 28:03.720
What the fuck is that?

28:03.800 --> 28:05.160
<i>Forró.</i>

28:05.280 --> 28:06.520
It isn't <i>forró?</i>

28:07.200 --> 28:09.080
Circle, message. Waltz.

28:09.640 --> 28:12.360
Hey, hey, hey. Too many chances.

28:12.440 --> 28:13.920
"Time's up."

28:14.000 --> 28:15.920
Geez, what was that?

28:16.480 --> 28:17.800
THE CORRECT ANSWER IS:
SOFRÊNCIA

28:17.880 --> 28:19.400
For God's sake!

28:20.040 --> 28:22.720
"Julia will try to guess in this round."

28:22.800 --> 28:25.000
Please, please. Give me an easy dance.

28:26.160 --> 28:29.880
-"Brazilian funk."
-Nice!

28:32.640 --> 28:34.880
I've seen those moves.

28:37.440 --> 28:39.680
Wow. She's quite a dancer.

28:39.760 --> 28:42.440
She knows how to twerk. Check it out.

28:44.120 --> 28:45.160
Twerk it.

28:47.520 --> 28:48.680
Circle.

28:49.600 --> 28:50.600
Brazilian funk.

28:50.680 --> 28:52.200
THE CIRCLE
THE ANSWER IS CORRECT

28:52.280 --> 28:53.760
Nice, Julia!

28:55.440 --> 28:58.240
"Gaybol will try to guess
in this round." Yes!

28:58.320 --> 28:59.440
My turn, let's go.

28:59.520 --> 29:01.080
"The dance style is..."

29:01.160 --> 29:02.440
<i>"Axé."</i>

29:05.680 --> 29:07.880
Up, down, and shimmy.

29:15.160 --> 29:17.360
Circle, message. <i>Axé.</i>

29:19.680 --> 29:21.560
Yeah!

29:21.640 --> 29:22.960
I got it right, dude!

29:25.080 --> 29:26.520
That was too easy.

29:27.840 --> 29:30.480
"Lorayne will try to guess in this round."

29:32.200 --> 29:34.160
-Brick dance.
-"Break dance."

29:35.800 --> 29:36.800
Nice!

29:38.560 --> 29:39.880
It's hip hop.

29:39.960 --> 29:41.600
It looks like hip hop.

29:42.160 --> 29:43.560
Send.

29:43.680 --> 29:44.600
Almost.

29:44.680 --> 29:47.400
Break... It's missing the "dance" part.
It looks like hip hop.

29:47.480 --> 29:48.520
Oh, God.

29:49.440 --> 29:50.520
What's that?

29:50.600 --> 29:52.800
It's break dance, Lorayne!

29:52.880 --> 29:54.040
Freestyle.

29:54.120 --> 29:55.200
Street dance.

29:55.800 --> 29:57.200
Dance from the streets.

30:01.600 --> 30:02.920
THE CIRCLE
TIME'S UP

30:03.000 --> 30:06.760
"The correct answer is break dance."

30:06.840 --> 30:08.520
Wow, dude!

30:08.600 --> 30:10.920
Too specific. I got the hardest one.

30:11.000 --> 30:12.440
Incompetent.

30:14.360 --> 30:15.800
"Dumaresq!"

30:16.200 --> 30:17.800
THE DANCE STYLE IS:
CALYPSO

30:21.600 --> 30:24.640

30:24.720 --> 30:25.800

30:26.960 --> 30:28.600
It looks like it. Doesn't it?

30:28.680 --> 30:29.720
Is it?

30:31.880 --> 30:33.800
She's whipping her hair back and forth.

30:33.880 --> 30:35.520
Whip your hair to your sides.

30:35.600 --> 30:36.920
To your sides.

30:37.680 --> 30:39.360
It's <i>calypso.</i>

30:39.440 --> 30:41.400
Circle, message. <i>Calypso.</i>

30:51.640 --> 30:53.320
Isn't it like that?

30:53.400 --> 30:55.280
Thank you, thank you.

30:56.640 --> 30:57.800
Good job, team!

30:58.600 --> 31:02.280
"Well done. The players who got it right
will receive a reward."

31:03.680 --> 31:07.840
<i>"The Circle</i> Certificate!"

31:07.920 --> 31:10.600

"...that Julia has excellent skills

31:17.520 --> 31:19.720
We're kings of dancing.

31:19.800 --> 31:23.560
I'm good, I got my coloring book.
But what could it be?

31:26.240 --> 31:29.000
Coconut water!

31:29.080 --> 31:32.680
So fancy! Guys, this is so me.

31:32.760 --> 31:34.120
I can hear the beach waves.

31:34.200 --> 31:35.520
Cheers to Luma.

31:36.800 --> 31:40.840
Hey, Nelson. Let's get our reward.
We deserve it too.

31:40.920 --> 31:42.680
Just a little. We deserve it.

31:42.760 --> 31:44.760
I didn't want it anyway.

31:45.280 --> 31:46.760
I'm fine.

31:46.840 --> 31:49.120
I love this. I have my coloring book.

31:52.040 --> 31:54.680
<i>Come on, Akel. Don't be a drama queen.</i>

31:55.120 --> 31:56.600
<i>The game's still on.</i>

32:02.200 --> 32:03.920
ALERT!

32:04.000 --> 32:06.800
-Alert! I'm alert!
-Whoa, alert!

32:06.880 --> 32:09.080
My heart skipped a bit.

32:09.160 --> 32:11.080
"It's time for the ratings."

32:11.160 --> 32:12.960
Oh, dear Lord!

32:13.040 --> 32:14.800
Just when I was relaxing here.

32:14.880 --> 32:19.000
"As a new player, Luma can rate,

32:19.080 --> 32:20.680
but cannot be rated."

32:21.480 --> 32:22.320
What?

32:24.680 --> 32:25.760
Great.

32:25.840 --> 32:29.320
It's fair. She'd be the least popular.

32:29.400 --> 32:32.960
"The top two players
will become influencers..."

32:33.040 --> 32:35.040
"...and will hold great power."

32:35.320 --> 32:36.160
Geez.

32:36.640 --> 32:38.680
"All other players

32:39.240 --> 32:41.480
will be at risk of being blocked."

32:41.560 --> 32:44.200
Circle, start my ratings.

32:46.080 --> 32:47.920
Let's go. The first place

32:48.000 --> 32:49.880
goes to Auntie Julia.

32:49.960 --> 32:51.680
She's very cool, joyful,

32:51.760 --> 32:53.920
has positive energy, and she's funny.

32:54.680 --> 32:56.520
In sixth place,

32:57.480 --> 32:58.720
I'd like to put Auntie.

32:58.800 --> 33:03.040
Because our goal here
is not just to flirt with everybody.

33:03.120 --> 33:05.760
The fourth place goes to Dumaresq.

33:05.840 --> 33:09.000
When he left the Playmakers Chat,

33:09.080 --> 33:13.240
I began to think he's a guy
who doesn't change his mind easily.

33:13.720 --> 33:15.240
In second place,

33:15.320 --> 33:16.600
Dumaresq.

33:18.120 --> 33:19.480
The first place...

33:20.080 --> 33:22.760
I'm going to give it to Marina.

33:22.840 --> 33:24.560
She was an influencer before,

33:24.840 --> 33:25.960
and she saved my ass.

33:26.040 --> 33:29.280
If she becomes an influencer today,
she might help me again.

33:29.360 --> 33:30.920
I have nothing bad...

33:31.360 --> 33:33.200
to say about her, but...

33:34.080 --> 33:35.080
it's a game.

33:35.400 --> 33:38.360
My fifth place goes to Marina.

33:41.240 --> 33:44.120
Circle, we're gonna put JP in first place.

33:44.200 --> 33:46.000
He's been really nice to Luma.

33:47.320 --> 33:50.520
He should have power,
so we can get to know him better.

33:50.600 --> 33:52.480
In last place, seventh place,

33:52.560 --> 33:54.120
I'm going to put JP.

33:54.200 --> 33:56.200
I can't relate that much to him.

33:56.280 --> 33:58.560
All he does is tell dad jokes

33:58.640 --> 34:00.200
and flirt with the girls.

34:00.280 --> 34:02.800
Since we don't interact much,

34:02.880 --> 34:05.760
and since I don't agree
with his points of view,

34:05.840 --> 34:08.560
the seventh place in my ratings
goes to Gaybol.

34:12.040 --> 34:13.840
In second place,

34:13.920 --> 34:16.000
I'm going to put Gaybol.

34:16.080 --> 34:18.960
He seems a fun person,

34:19.040 --> 34:21.320
a smart guy.

34:21.400 --> 34:23.640
Circle, Lucas in third.

34:23.720 --> 34:25.520
We're very similar.

34:26.080 --> 34:28.320
He's also trying to be cool.

34:28.400 --> 34:29.520
Calm, collected.

34:29.600 --> 34:32.640
Lucas, you're in seventh place.

34:32.720 --> 34:34.440
We haven't interacted that much.

34:34.520 --> 34:35.480
Since...

34:35.760 --> 34:40.240
the person I've been talking to
the most is Lolo,

34:40.320 --> 34:43.040
and since she has a good chance
of becoming an influencer...

34:43.120 --> 34:45.680
If I were her,
I'd try to keep me in the game

34:45.760 --> 34:48.600
because I'm giving her good ratings.

34:48.680 --> 34:50.280
Circle,

34:50.360 --> 34:52.800
the first place goes to Lorayne.

34:54.840 --> 34:56.040
The second place

34:56.120 --> 34:57.480
goes to Akel.

34:57.560 --> 34:59.480
In our private chat,

34:59.560 --> 35:01.760
we joked about being a couple.

35:01.840 --> 35:05.960
I think we're about to establish
a real partnership.

35:06.040 --> 35:08.280
Fourth place goes to Akel.

35:08.360 --> 35:11.520
In the previous ratings, we joined forces,

35:11.600 --> 35:15.120
but he never talked to me again.

35:15.200 --> 35:18.320
I have a feeling that he used me

35:18.400 --> 35:20.640
for his own benefit, however...

35:20.960 --> 35:23.640
the partnership, in theory, is still on.

35:23.720 --> 35:26.920
Circle, submit my ratings.

35:27.440 --> 35:29.920
RATINGS COMPLETED

35:30.000 --> 35:33.560
Those capital letters
make my heart skip a beat.

35:33.640 --> 35:35.520
I'm pretty sure...

35:36.840 --> 35:38.760
I won't be an influencer.

35:41.680 --> 35:45.240
<i>Will the praised be humiliated this time?</i>

35:50.800 --> 35:53.160
Luma would like to talk to JP.

35:53.240 --> 35:56.080
Why? He's single, he's 28.

35:56.160 --> 35:58.560
He's been nice to her since yesterday.

35:58.640 --> 36:02.000
Circle, open private chat with JP.

36:03.440 --> 36:05.960
"Luma has invited you to a private chat."

36:06.040 --> 36:08.880
I want in. Let's see what she has to say.

36:09.440 --> 36:10.640
Circle, message.

36:10.720 --> 36:11.720
Hello, neighbor.

36:11.800 --> 36:15.520
Was my dance that good
or was it too easy to guess?

36:15.600 --> 36:18.280
I almost broke my little toe.

36:18.360 --> 36:19.400
Send.

36:19.680 --> 36:21.800
Almost broke your little toe, babe?

36:21.880 --> 36:22.840
Circle, message.

36:22.920 --> 36:24.280
Hello, beautiful.

36:24.360 --> 36:28.480
You got in the game
and made everybody dance already.

36:28.560 --> 36:30.720
"And you really got some moves."

36:31.240 --> 36:32.680
Circle, message.

36:32.760 --> 36:34.400
Tell me about the game.

36:34.480 --> 36:37.200
I'm trying to find out who's a catfish.

36:37.280 --> 36:39.440
You would be a great catfish, by the way.

36:40.040 --> 36:41.000
Send.

36:41.600 --> 36:43.840
She quickly changed the subject.

36:43.920 --> 36:45.800
She's focused on the game.

36:45.880 --> 36:47.040
Circle, message.

36:47.120 --> 36:50.360
Thanks for the compliment, princess,
but I'm not a catfish at all.

36:51.520 --> 36:54.240
Soon we'll find out who's a catfish.

36:54.320 --> 36:56.760
I can already tell
you're an amazing person.

36:57.520 --> 37:00.680
"I want you fighting by my side.
We're in this together."

37:00.760 --> 37:02.320
We've got him!

37:02.400 --> 37:04.040
Come here, JP!

37:04.120 --> 37:05.960
It was great getting to know you.

37:06.040 --> 37:08.880
-Now I know who to talk to...
-...in case I need any help.

37:10.800 --> 37:12.640
#InThisTogether.

37:12.720 --> 37:14.240
#Kisses.

37:14.320 --> 37:15.720
I like the "#Kisses" part.

37:15.800 --> 37:17.680
Maybe she's a catfish

37:17.760 --> 37:19.640
and wants to know

37:19.720 --> 37:23.320
how the players are dealing
with a potential catfish.

37:23.960 --> 37:25.440
Luma's first ally.

37:25.520 --> 37:28.200
The first one. She deserves a trophy.

37:31.560 --> 37:33.320
-Alert!
-Oh, God.

37:33.400 --> 37:34.320
Here it comes.

37:34.400 --> 37:36.600
I can't believe
we have the results already.

37:37.520 --> 37:39.640
"The rating results are in."

37:39.720 --> 37:41.680
Oh, no!

37:41.760 --> 37:43.200
Whoa!

37:43.720 --> 37:44.760
Somebody's screwed.

37:44.840 --> 37:47.440
The influencers are going to block someone

37:47.520 --> 37:48.760
again!

37:48.840 --> 37:51.160
It's the moment of truth.

37:51.640 --> 37:54.040
Circle, open the results.

37:55.280 --> 37:56.600
"Eighth."

37:57.080 --> 37:58.520
I don't want to look, dude.

37:58.600 --> 38:00.720
-Stressful.
-My heart is beating too fast.

38:01.920 --> 38:03.720
Fuck, dude!

38:04.400 --> 38:06.160
I can't believe it, bro!

38:06.240 --> 38:08.160
I've screwed up.

38:11.240 --> 38:13.280
This is no place for ass-kissers.

38:13.360 --> 38:16.560
Whoever gets last place, usually...

38:18.280 --> 38:19.120
leaves, right?

38:20.400 --> 38:21.400
"Seventh."

38:22.560 --> 38:23.480
Who is it?

38:23.560 --> 38:25.600
Lucas, Julia, or JP.

38:25.680 --> 38:28.160
It can't be us.

38:29.160 --> 38:30.520
Fuck!

38:33.880 --> 38:34.720
Shit.

38:39.040 --> 38:41.040
You don't show us who you really are.

38:41.120 --> 38:43.560
What do we know about you, honey?

38:44.760 --> 38:46.080
"Fifth."

38:46.160 --> 38:47.360
No sixth place?

38:47.440 --> 38:48.640
It's a tie.

38:48.720 --> 38:50.560
Two people are in fifth place.

38:52.480 --> 38:53.320
Nice.

38:53.920 --> 38:55.680
It's good. Perfect.

38:55.760 --> 38:56.960
Dang!

38:57.640 --> 39:00.000
I wasn't expecting that.

39:02.360 --> 39:05.040
Both catfish together!

39:06.480 --> 39:09.400
Let's go, Dumaresq!

39:10.880 --> 39:11.720
Have faith.

39:12.000 --> 39:12.840
"Fourth."

39:13.440 --> 39:14.960
Let's see who's in fourth place.

39:15.040 --> 39:17.600
Come on, Marina.
How about you being fourth?

39:18.160 --> 39:20.520
It's either me or Lorayne.

39:23.280 --> 39:24.840
"Fourth place goes to...

39:25.320 --> 39:26.600
Akel."

39:27.880 --> 39:29.320
Thank you, Jesus!

39:32.480 --> 39:35.600
Oh, my God! Don't do that to me!

39:37.960 --> 39:40.840
I can't believe that the top three

39:40.920 --> 39:42.400
is once again

39:42.480 --> 39:45.800
me, Mari, and Lora!

39:45.880 --> 39:47.560
I really hope,

39:47.880 --> 39:51.040
from the bottom of my heart,
I've managed to go up

39:51.120 --> 39:53.640
at least one position in the ranking.

39:56.640 --> 39:57.880
What?

39:59.400 --> 40:00.960
No way.

40:01.040 --> 40:03.120
Oh, my God.

40:03.200 --> 40:04.520
Oh, my God.

40:07.840 --> 40:10.080
Well, even though I'm beautiful,

40:10.160 --> 40:12.640
even though I'm wearing gold,

40:12.720 --> 40:15.760
I'm going to join the At Risk Chat.

40:15.840 --> 40:17.920
I think it's time for me...

40:18.280 --> 40:19.800
to touch people's hearts.

40:20.000 --> 40:20.880
Maybe?

40:21.320 --> 40:23.840
Let's make this character more complex..

40:23.920 --> 40:27.400
He went down on the list a bit.
I wonder why.

40:27.480 --> 40:30.320
He's attacking people
for the silliest things.

40:30.400 --> 40:32.360
He talked about Julia.

40:32.440 --> 40:35.600
That was uncalled-for.
Let her talk about sex.

40:39.080 --> 40:42.600
I think I'm second place.
If I'm in first, God help me.

40:42.680 --> 40:44.120
The girls must be nervous.

40:44.680 --> 40:47.960
Seeing people accepting me for who I am...

40:50.000 --> 40:51.000
Man...

40:52.440 --> 40:54.800
I can't explain the feeling.

40:55.680 --> 40:57.840
Whoa! No way!

40:57.920 --> 41:00.360
I'm in first place!

41:07.000 --> 41:09.560
-Good job, blondie.
-Well done.

41:09.640 --> 41:11.240
Oh, come on!

41:11.320 --> 41:13.440
What's wrong with these people?

41:14.680 --> 41:16.840
Don't forget, Lora and Mari,

41:16.920 --> 41:20.360
that I'm your "ally."

41:20.880 --> 41:24.320
Don't you mess up
and say nasty things about me.

41:25.160 --> 41:26.480
I'll find out one day.

41:27.480 --> 41:30.240
I can't believe I'm going to cry.

41:31.400 --> 41:32.920
Excuse me.

41:34.880 --> 41:35.840
Fuck it.

41:37.040 --> 41:38.280
That's it.

41:38.360 --> 41:40.880
Wow, I loved the results.

41:42.240 --> 41:43.360
Nice!

41:50.880 --> 41:52.000
Let me take a seat.

41:52.080 --> 41:53.280
Lolo, baby.

41:53.680 --> 41:54.920
Well done.

41:55.000 --> 41:57.080
With great power
comes great responsibility.

41:57.160 --> 42:00.440
Don't block your boo, for the love of God.

42:00.520 --> 42:02.520
For now, I don't have any fears

42:02.600 --> 42:06.800
when it comes to elimination
or something like that.

42:06.880 --> 42:09.560
Julia's still in the game.

42:09.640 --> 42:10.960
I'm blocking someone.

42:11.520 --> 42:13.680
<i>It's tough, but you have to do it.</i>

42:13.760 --> 42:14.880
Damn.

42:25.160 --> 42:26.880
-Whoa, alert.
-Alert.

42:26.960 --> 42:29.000
I couldn't be more alert, man.

42:29.080 --> 42:30.040
Here we go.

42:31.200 --> 42:33.320
Oh, my God.

42:33.400 --> 42:34.360
Fuck.

42:34.440 --> 42:38.320
To be honest,
I don't want to be me right now.

42:38.800 --> 42:41.960
"As the most popular players..."

42:42.040 --> 42:45.560
"...Lorayne and Marina
are now <i>The Circle</i> influencers."

42:49.640 --> 42:51.240
Wow, two of them.

42:51.320 --> 42:53.320
Influencers have power.

42:53.400 --> 42:55.560
Congratulations, girls. You deserve it.

42:56.760 --> 42:59.960
"All other players failed

43:00.040 --> 43:01.240
and are at risk..."

43:01.320 --> 43:03.840
"...of being blocked."

43:04.360 --> 43:06.240
Here comes some stress.

43:06.320 --> 43:10.640
"The influencers must decide
which at-risk player they will block."

43:11.680 --> 43:13.040
"Lorayne and Marina,

43:13.120 --> 43:16.480
please go to the Blue Room
to make your decision."

43:17.280 --> 43:18.400
God help me.

43:19.200 --> 43:20.640
Shit.

43:21.280 --> 43:22.840
Don't freak out.

43:22.920 --> 43:26.400
No matter what happens,
you guys were great.

43:26.480 --> 43:28.440
Everybody did well.

43:32.200 --> 43:34.520
I'm sorry, I won't deny it.
I feel powerful.

43:34.600 --> 43:37.520
I was crying my eyes out,
and now... Fuck it.

43:38.080 --> 43:40.440
Excuse me. This is my moment.

43:50.280 --> 43:51.280
Wow.

43:51.840 --> 43:53.800
So fancy!

43:55.480 --> 43:58.040
<i>This is Lorayne's first time</i>
<i>in the Influencer Chat.</i>

43:58.120 --> 44:00.680
<i>Will popularity go to her head?</i>

44:00.760 --> 44:03.040
I like this feeling of power.

44:03.120 --> 44:05.480
I'm going to know
Marina's opinions on people.

44:05.560 --> 44:09.960
I like having another person's
strategic perspectives.

44:12.000 --> 44:14.480
The Blue Room is mine already.

44:14.560 --> 44:18.880
Excuse me. Your queen is here.

44:18.960 --> 44:20.880
Okay? All right?

44:21.640 --> 44:23.200
<i>Popularity went to this one's head.</i>

44:23.280 --> 44:25.280
Now things are gonna get serious.

44:25.880 --> 44:28.520
I want to stick to my ideas.

44:29.520 --> 44:31.760
I believe I am...

44:32.920 --> 44:34.160
on the right path.

any difference. #InTheCrosshairs.

45:48.920 --> 45:51.600
Yeah. He's strange.

47:08.480 --> 47:10.840
I was rude,

47:10.920 --> 47:13.240
straightforward, and too lewd.

47:13.320 --> 47:15.720
I couldn't show my true self.

47:16.200 --> 47:17.120
Send.

47:18.280 --> 47:20.760
Yeah, you're kinda lewd, Julia.

47:20.840 --> 47:22.800
"Auntie will take care of you."

47:22.880 --> 47:24.560
If it was up to me,

47:25.120 --> 47:27.520
you would be first place.

47:28.080 --> 47:29.720
Circle, message.

47:29.800 --> 47:33.400
The suspense and anxiety
came in strong today... Ellipsis.

47:33.480 --> 47:36.960
Two sad face emojis.
#BeingAtRiskIsTough.

47:37.040 --> 47:38.640
Circle, send message.

47:39.200 --> 47:42.240
I hope you're a catfish, Gaybol.

47:42.320 --> 47:44.640
I said nasty things about you.

47:49.760 --> 47:53.400
I hope we share the same opinions.

47:56.840 --> 47:58.280
Circle, message.

47:59.360 --> 48:02.160
What do you think about Julia?

48:02.720 --> 48:03.680
Send.

48:05.120 --> 48:08.040
I'm still a little suspicious about her.

48:08.120 --> 48:10.600
For me, she's not compromising.

48:10.680 --> 48:12.800
#MysteriousAuntie.

48:13.240 --> 48:18.200
She keeps sending knife emojis,
fire emojis, and all that.

48:18.280 --> 48:19.720
Circle, message.

48:20.520 --> 48:24.160
What Dumaresq said in the group chat

48:24.240 --> 48:25.960
is basically what I think.

48:26.040 --> 48:27.120
Send.

48:28.560 --> 48:30.680
That's right. I couldn't agree more.

48:30.760 --> 48:33.680
Sis, what do you think about Gaybol?

48:33.760 --> 48:34.720
Send.

48:35.560 --> 48:37.360
Circle, message.

48:37.800 --> 48:40.240
He knows I'm into video games,

48:40.320 --> 48:42.720
and he doesn't get excited about it.

48:42.800 --> 48:44.920
#SlowDude.

48:45.000 --> 48:47.640
#NerdWithNoPlayer2.

48:47.720 --> 48:48.800
Send.

48:49.560 --> 48:52.560
Yeah, his messages aren't very creative.

48:52.640 --> 48:53.880
He's a little shy.

48:53.960 --> 48:55.720
Circle, message.

48:55.800 --> 48:57.760
Dude, comma,

48:57.840 --> 49:01.640
I think we should choose...

49:01.720 --> 49:04.040
"...JP, Gaybol, or Julia.

49:04.120 --> 49:06.400
They either said something wrong,

49:06.480 --> 49:08.240
or they're weird,

49:08.320 --> 49:10.160
or they're too slow.

49:10.240 --> 49:12.600
#HeartOnTheLine."

49:17.440 --> 49:19.080
Shit. Help me, Marina.

49:19.160 --> 49:21.720
Yeah, it's hard for her too.

49:37.120 --> 49:38.840
Circle, message.

49:38.920 --> 49:42.080
I'm gonna give them the bad news.

49:42.160 --> 49:43.040
Send.

49:59.600 --> 50:01.800
Shit, here it comes. Alert.

50:01.880 --> 50:03.120
What does that mean?

50:03.200 --> 50:05.560
<i>The Circle</i> Alert!

50:06.280 --> 50:10.160
"The influencers
have made their decision."

50:11.880 --> 50:13.480
Don't stress.

50:14.320 --> 50:15.640
Oh, my God.

50:15.920 --> 50:17.400
I hope it's not Julia.

50:19.280 --> 50:22.000
"All players must go to <i>The Circle</i> Chat."

50:22.080 --> 50:24.720
They must be shitting their pants.

50:24.800 --> 50:27.880
I'm going to bite my hands,
the toy. I'm fucked.

50:31.520 --> 50:33.440
Circle, message.

50:33.720 --> 50:34.640
CIRCLE CHAT

50:34.720 --> 50:36.280
Marina is gonna say it.

50:40.520 --> 50:43.600
Lorayne and I
don't even know what to say.

50:43.680 --> 50:45.120
"#FullGratitude."

50:45.200 --> 50:46.640
"#TooMuchLove."

50:46.720 --> 50:48.320
"#MayYouShine."

50:48.400 --> 50:51.200
Just don't say my name.
You can say anything else.

50:51.280 --> 50:53.280
We don't think this person

50:53.840 --> 50:56.160
is being honest in the game.

50:57.840 --> 50:59.960
"They lack the intensity

51:00.040 --> 51:02.120
they said they had."

51:02.200 --> 51:04.000
I never said I was intense.

51:04.080 --> 51:06.320
Goddammit, it could be me.

51:06.400 --> 51:08.960
Oh, no. Hang in there.

51:09.040 --> 51:12.440
The person we've decided to block is...

51:12.520 --> 51:13.800
Ellipsis.

51:14.960 --> 51:16.000
Here it goes.

51:18.760 --> 51:21.680
I'm not gonna read it.
If I don't read it, it won't happen.

51:21.760 --> 51:24.320
Don't stress. Not me, not me, not me.

51:24.400 --> 51:26.280
Jesus Christ.

51:26.840 --> 51:28.800
Come on, sis!

51:39.480 --> 51:40.320
Julia?

51:40.400 --> 51:41.880
What?

51:41.960 --> 51:45.240
Holy shit! What the fuck?

51:49.640 --> 51:52.000
The game's still on!

51:53.800 --> 51:55.480
JULIA HAS BEEN BLOCKED FROM THE CIRCLE

51:55.560 --> 51:58.120
The only thing I did was joke around

51:58.200 --> 51:59.840
and flirt with everybody.

51:59.920 --> 52:04.240
Since Marina is possessive,
she wanted someone just for her.

52:04.320 --> 52:07.720
Maybe she got jealous of Lucas.
That was the reason.

52:08.320 --> 52:09.880
BLOCKED

52:15.840 --> 52:17.920
Wow, Julia is gone.

52:18.880 --> 52:21.760
#ByeByeAuntie.

52:23.280 --> 52:25.480
Well, Auntie's gone.

52:26.960 --> 52:29.440
No more spice in the game.

52:30.480 --> 52:32.800
I thought it would be anybody but Julia.

52:33.360 --> 52:35.560
I can't wait to find out

52:35.640 --> 52:38.960
if Julia is a catfish or not.

52:40.720 --> 52:43.480
I'm pissed. I'm really pissed.

52:44.160 --> 52:46.000
I'm really mad.

52:46.520 --> 52:49.120
<i>It looks like Auntie didn't win them over.</i>

52:49.800 --> 52:51.920
<i>Who said it would be easy?</i>

52:52.440 --> 52:56.240
If she comes to meet me
holding a knife, God help me.

53:04.880 --> 53:06.240
-Whoa!
-Alert!

53:07.080 --> 53:08.080
You scared me!

53:09.960 --> 53:12.440
Enough of this. Enough.

53:12.520 --> 53:14.080
"Before leaving,

53:14.160 --> 53:17.520
Julia can meet one player in person."

53:17.600 --> 53:19.400
She's the one who chooses.

53:20.160 --> 53:21.040
Who will it be?

53:21.120 --> 53:23.960
I'm tidying up in case she comes over.

53:24.040 --> 53:26.400
I'm putting on some cologne.
You never know.

53:26.480 --> 53:30.480
It might be a 20-year-old hot girl,
or even Julia herself.

53:31.200 --> 53:33.120
Checking if I need more deodorant.

53:33.200 --> 53:35.840
She could come over here.
I liked her so much.

53:35.920 --> 53:39.520
Take the knives from this woman.

53:39.600 --> 53:41.760
If she opens my door,

53:41.840 --> 53:43.520
she wants trouble.

53:43.600 --> 53:45.000
Will she meet JP?

53:45.080 --> 53:47.080
So the firefighter can put out her fire?

53:47.160 --> 53:48.480
Come over, Auntie.

54:09.840 --> 54:10.680
Oh, no.

54:51.080 --> 54:53.080
