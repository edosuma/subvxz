00:00.001 --> 00:01.734
[NARRATOR]
Previously, on<i> Dark Matter</i> .

00:01.735 --> 00:03.468
[NYX] There's only
one way off this rock,

00:03.471 --> 00:04.703
and that's by shuttle.

00:04.705 --> 00:07.206
And what would
you want in return, Nyx?

00:07.208 --> 00:08.941
We're not leaving you behind.

00:08.942 --> 00:10.675
[THREE] It's a bad idea to
have a cop on board this ship.

00:10.678 --> 00:12.611
[ARAX] Tell me what
it is you're after.

00:12.613 --> 00:14.713
[REYNAUD] Like I said
before, it's valuable.

00:14.715 --> 00:16.549
That's all you need to know.

00:16.550 --> 00:18.384
If you want the people
who are really responsible,

00:18.386 --> 00:20.185
you have to keep me alive.

00:20.187 --> 00:22.521
You're the one
who pulled the trigger.

00:22.523 --> 00:24.556
For now, that's good enough.

00:24.558 --> 00:27.126
[NYX] When I fight,
it's like things slow down.

00:27.128 --> 00:29.328
I can guess
my opponent's moves.

00:30.398 --> 00:32.464
[NYX grunting]

00:41.442 --> 00:43.208
Again.

00:43.210 --> 00:44.676
[NYX]
How 'bout a break?

00:44.678 --> 00:47.613
I fight by instinct, by feel.

00:47.615 --> 00:50.182
If I repeat the moves too much,
it works against me.

00:54.121 --> 00:55.421
[NYX]
So, you feel any better?

00:55.423 --> 00:57.756
Now that you've
taken care of Jace Corso?

00:57.758 --> 01:00.059
[FOUR] I cannot allow
myself to be satisfied

01:00.061 --> 01:02.494
by one small act of revenge.

01:02.496 --> 01:04.263
Why not?

01:04.265 --> 01:07.633
Because there are so
many more that are necessary.

01:07.635 --> 01:11.570
You never consider
just letting it go?

01:11.572 --> 01:13.372
Putting it all behind you?

01:13.374 --> 01:15.340
No.

01:15.342 --> 01:18.110
What about you?
You never speak of your past.

01:18.112 --> 01:22.114
Is it because you let it go?
Put it all behind you?

01:22.116 --> 01:23.515
No.

01:54.181 --> 01:56.215
Time to go back in.

02:02.690 --> 02:05.424
I know this is hard on you.

02:05.426 --> 02:08.227
It's hard on everyone.

02:08.229 --> 02:13.365
But it's our responsibility to
use the gift we've been given.

02:13.367 --> 02:16.802
We are changing things
for the better.

02:16.804 --> 02:20.572
Not just for us,
but for everyone.

02:24.778 --> 02:26.478
[PILOT]
Stand by for FTL.

02:27.681 --> 02:30.749
[grunting]

02:34.922 --> 02:37.656
[PILOT]
Stand by for FTL.

02:37.658 --> 02:40.726
[grunting]

02:54.942 --> 02:56.208
You can't leave...

02:56.210 --> 02:57.743
Watch me.

02:57.745 --> 02:59.845
We'll find you...

02:59.847 --> 03:02.247
He'll find you...

03:02.249 --> 03:03.849
[grunting]

03:54.668 --> 03:55.901
[THE ANDROID]
Hello, Two.

03:55.903 --> 03:57.603
[TWO]
You wanted to see me?

03:57.605 --> 03:59.504
[THE ANDROID] I found
evidence that Arax was using

03:59.506 --> 04:02.541
the subspace link when
he was in control of the ship.

04:02.543 --> 04:05.711
He deleted the comm logs,
but by tracking the power usage

04:05.713 --> 04:08.313
I was able to identify
specific times that the array

04:08.315 --> 04:09.915
was active.

04:13.587 --> 04:16.388
Is something wrong?

04:16.390 --> 04:19.391
No, I just couldn't
help but notice.

04:19.393 --> 04:20.926
New look?

04:20.928 --> 04:22.427
I thought this was
more appropriate

04:22.429 --> 04:24.930
for everyday wear on the ship.

04:24.932 --> 04:28.400
More like an ordinary Android?

04:28.402 --> 04:30.569
Perhaps "ordinary"
is not the right word.

04:30.571 --> 04:33.905
No. Probably not.

04:33.907 --> 04:36.742
The ability to pose
as human could prove useful,

04:36.744 --> 04:38.810
so for now, I've
retained the upgrade.

04:38.812 --> 04:41.313
But while I'm on the ship...

04:43.450 --> 04:45.584
You just wanna be yourself.

04:45.586 --> 04:47.619
Precisely.

04:47.621 --> 04:49.955
I've kept the outfit
just in case.

04:52.359 --> 04:54.693
You wanna tell me
more about this comm?

04:54.695 --> 04:56.495
The delete function
makes it impossible

04:56.497 --> 04:58.830
to replay previous
transmissions,

04:58.832 --> 05:01.767
but it does leave
behind fragments of data.

05:01.769 --> 05:03.702
I was able to piece
together an image

05:03.704 --> 05:05.671
of the person Arax
was speaking with,

05:05.673 --> 05:07.939
and run it through
facial recognition.

05:07.941 --> 05:09.474
Who is she?

05:09.476 --> 05:11.977
[THE ANDROID]
Her name is Alicia Reynaud.

05:11.979 --> 05:13.412
[TWO]
She's corporate elite.

05:13.414 --> 05:14.880
On the boards of half
a dozen companies,

05:14.882 --> 05:17.749
all of which are at least
partly owned by Ferrous.

05:17.751 --> 05:18.950
Guessing she
didn't get that far

05:18.952 --> 05:20.652
by playing by the rules.

05:20.654 --> 05:21.887
[FIVE] You think she's
the one who had my friends

05:21.889 --> 05:23.622
killed over this?

05:23.624 --> 05:24.756
[TWO]
It's possible.

05:24.758 --> 05:27.759
[TWO]
Well, if she wants it that bad,

05:27.761 --> 05:29.094
she must know what it is.

05:29.096 --> 05:31.096
Let's just go find her.

05:31.098 --> 05:32.948
Get some answers.

05:32.949 --> 05:34.799
I doubt she'll be
volunteering any information.

05:34.802 --> 05:36.034
We'll insist.

05:36.036 --> 05:37.636
[TWO]
It might not be as easy as that.

05:37.638 --> 05:39.705
Her headquarters
is practically a fortress.

05:39.707 --> 05:40.739
[THE ANDROID]
And well out of range

05:40.741 --> 05:42.074
of our current fuel reserves.

05:42.076 --> 05:43.608
[TWO] We would need to
restock before we took on

05:43.610 --> 05:44.843
something like this.

05:44.845 --> 05:46.678
What do you suggest?

05:46.680 --> 05:49.448
An op. The kind
we used to pull.

05:49.450 --> 05:51.683
[THREE] All right, now
you're talking my language.

05:51.685 --> 05:53.585
Good old-fashioned heist?

05:53.587 --> 05:55.387
Huh?

05:55.389 --> 05:58.590
So, who we knocking off?

05:58.592 --> 06:01.727
Actually, I was gonna
ask for suggestions.

06:01.729 --> 06:04.029
[NYX]
I might have something.

06:04.031 --> 06:06.998
Before I got nabbed,
I hitched a ride on a freighter.

06:07.000 --> 06:09.601
Takes a regular
route in a system nearby.

06:09.603 --> 06:11.636
I know where it stops.

06:11.638 --> 06:13.905
So?

06:13.907 --> 06:15.607
Well, I did a little
snooping around

06:15.609 --> 06:16.942
while I was on board.

06:16.944 --> 06:18.977
Highly valuable cargo.

06:18.979 --> 06:21.413
Small crates, lightweight.

06:21.415 --> 06:22.681
Easily transported.

06:22.683 --> 06:25.584
Okay, what are we talking about?

06:25.586 --> 06:27.686
Shadow.

06:28.822 --> 06:30.455
What's that?

06:30.457 --> 06:32.491
Are you kidding?

06:32.493 --> 06:33.892
Protase 130?

06:33.894 --> 06:36.862
Stop making me ask
"What's that?"

06:36.864 --> 06:39.398
Shadow is, uh, the street name.

06:39.400 --> 06:42.167
It's a synthetic hallucinogen.

06:42.169 --> 06:43.168
A party drug.

06:43.170 --> 06:44.503
It's the latest thing.

06:44.505 --> 06:46.138
Do we really want
to get into that?

06:46.140 --> 06:48.540
[NYX]
It's a quick and easy score.

06:48.542 --> 06:51.576
Which is exactly what we need.

06:51.578 --> 06:54.012
Or am I wrong?

06:57.551 --> 06:58.700
[SIX]
Drugs?

06:58.701 --> 06:59.850
Technically illegal,
but the GA's

06:59.853 --> 07:01.019
been looking the other way.

07:01.021 --> 07:02.154
And why do you think that is?

07:02.156 --> 07:03.422
It's what people want.

07:03.424 --> 07:04.890
It's what the corporations want.

07:04.892 --> 07:06.825
It keeps people
pacified, distracted.

07:06.827 --> 07:08.827
Look, you are not
the only one on this ship

07:08.829 --> 07:11.062
that doesn't wanna be a
pawn in the system anymore.

07:11.064 --> 07:12.831
But one step at a time.

07:12.833 --> 07:15.000
We need the money.

07:15.002 --> 07:16.034
You know what, Three
and Four don't want you

07:16.036 --> 07:17.702
on this op anyway.

07:17.704 --> 07:18.937
Then why do you
care what I think?

07:18.939 --> 07:20.205
[TWO]
We've been down this road.

07:20.207 --> 07:22.174
I'm not doing it again.

07:22.176 --> 07:25.444
If I tried to turn you in,
I'd be arrested myself.

07:25.446 --> 07:28.680
I'm not sure that would
make a difference.

07:28.682 --> 07:30.449
They'd kill all of you.

07:30.451 --> 07:32.517
You know I couldn't
be a part of that.

07:33.787 --> 07:34.886
Not good enough.

07:34.888 --> 07:36.188
If you're gonna
stay on this ship,

07:36.190 --> 07:39.491
I need to hear you say it:
you're okay with this.

07:39.493 --> 07:41.693
Otherwise, we let you off
at the nearest station.

07:55.509 --> 07:59.044
Their shields are disabled, but
likely only for a short time.

07:59.046 --> 08:00.045
They're firing back.

08:00.047 --> 08:00.979
[alarm blaring]

08:00.981 --> 08:03.515
[explosions]

08:03.517 --> 08:05.917
We'll draw their fire
until you're on board.

08:05.919 --> 08:07.986
Roger that.

08:07.988 --> 08:09.054
Here we go.

08:09.056 --> 08:11.256
You sure about this?

08:11.258 --> 08:13.024
You worry too much.

08:13.026 --> 08:14.960
I've been practicing.

08:14.962 --> 08:17.028
Wow. Seriously?

08:18.165 --> 08:19.831
Learned that one the hard way.

08:41.522 --> 08:42.687
[screaming]

08:46.059 --> 08:47.659
Nice.

08:54.535 --> 08:55.967
What do we got here?

08:55.969 --> 08:57.636
[NYX]
Stun weapons.

08:57.638 --> 08:58.937
Decent charge capacity,

08:58.939 --> 09:01.306
if you don't boost
the levels too high.

09:01.308 --> 09:03.775
Take 'em.

09:03.777 --> 09:05.227
Seriously?

09:05.228 --> 09:06.678
We don't wanna kill anyone
if we can avoid it.

09:06.680 --> 09:08.079
[THREE groans]

09:20.794 --> 09:22.027
That should keep
them out of this area

09:22.029 --> 09:23.828
for a little while.

09:25.299 --> 09:27.832
[NYX] Storage compartments
are that way.

09:27.834 --> 09:29.634
I'll go down here.

09:29.636 --> 09:31.169
I'm pretty sure
there's an infirmary.

09:31.171 --> 09:32.804
I'm with you.

09:56.897 --> 09:58.697
You know this ship pretty well.

09:58.699 --> 10:01.066
[NYX]
I told you: I already cased it.

10:08.642 --> 10:10.041
[TWO]
What the hell is this?

10:12.079 --> 10:13.845
[TWO]
Hey, Nyx, what is this place?

10:15.115 --> 10:16.715
Hey, I said, what is this place?

10:16.717 --> 10:18.116
Who are all these people?

10:21.254 --> 10:22.854
This is my brother.

10:52.419 --> 10:54.753
Two, come in.

10:54.755 --> 10:56.321
Looks like we got
what we came for.

10:56.323 --> 10:58.323
[TWO] Haul as much as you
can back to the Marauder.

10:58.325 --> 10:59.357
I'll meet you there.

10:59.359 --> 11:00.859
[THREE]
Roger that.

11:00.861 --> 11:02.394
You better start talking.

11:02.396 --> 11:04.362
I'll explain everything
once we get back to the ship.

11:04.364 --> 11:06.164
Now you want me to trust you?

11:06.166 --> 11:08.099
[NYX]
I didn't lie about the drugs.

11:08.101 --> 11:09.768
You got your score.

11:09.769 --> 11:11.436
It looks like you might have
left out some details.

11:11.438 --> 11:13.938
[NYX] I couldn't take
the chance you'd say "No."

11:13.940 --> 11:17.142
All these people
here are prisoners,

11:17.144 --> 11:19.344
and I swore I'd get
my brother out of here.

11:20.981 --> 11:22.414
[clanging]

11:24.418 --> 11:26.785
They've cut us off.

11:26.787 --> 11:29.120
Blow the door.

11:30.791 --> 11:33.391
Either shoot me or help me.

11:33.393 --> 11:36.061
But whatever you're gonna do,
you'd better do it soon.

11:43.203 --> 11:44.436
Milo.

11:44.438 --> 11:47.238
Milo, it's me, Nyx.

11:47.240 --> 11:50.041
Milo, we're getting
you outta here.

11:51.712 --> 11:53.244
I knew you'd come.

11:53.246 --> 11:54.846
We gotta move.

11:54.848 --> 11:56.247
Come on.

12:01.221 --> 12:02.153
Two, come in.

12:02.155 --> 12:03.088
[TWO]
We're on our way.

12:03.090 --> 12:03.988
Plus one.

12:03.990 --> 12:05.290
It's a long story.

12:05.292 --> 12:07.192
[explosion]

12:07.194 --> 12:09.027
Think we're about
to have some company.

12:09.029 --> 12:10.428
Fire it up.

12:24.978 --> 12:26.377

Go!

12:31.251 --> 12:32.851

12:39.893 --> 12:42.193
Flying straight is
not an evasive maneuver.

12:42.195 --> 12:44.262
No, but it's the fastest route.

12:44.264 --> 12:49.033
[alarms blaring]

12:49.035 --> 12:52.070
They're targeting our FTL drive,
trying to disable us.

12:53.840 --> 12:54.873
[THREE]
Android, we're in.

12:54.875 --> 12:55.840
Get us outta here.

12:55.842 --> 12:57.242
Gladly.

13:07.387 --> 13:08.987
[MAN]
They got away.

13:14.060 --> 13:15.426
For now.

13:15.428 --> 13:17.328
Nyx was with them.

13:19.399 --> 13:22.300
It was the Raza.

13:22.302 --> 13:24.302
We should've seen this coming.

13:24.304 --> 13:25.904
[MAN]
And why didn't we?

13:28.008 --> 13:29.541
Good question.

13:38.485 --> 13:40.084
Start talking.

13:40.086 --> 13:43.421
When we were children, we were
taken from our home planet,

13:43.423 --> 13:45.523
along with over a
hundred of our people,

13:45.525 --> 13:47.559
subjected to an experiment
on board that ship.

13:47.561 --> 13:49.895
What kind of experiment?

13:49.896 --> 13:52.230
We were drugged, put into
pods that linked our minds.

13:52.232 --> 13:53.498
The experiment was
designed to see

13:53.500 --> 13:55.066
if the collective
human consciousness

13:55.068 --> 13:57.535
could solve problems
better than computers.

13:57.537 --> 14:00.021
Who did this to you?

14:00.022 --> 14:02.506
[NYX] Originally, it was
a corporation called Electus.

14:02.509 --> 14:04.042
Originally? Hey.

14:04.044 --> 14:06.411
[NYX] Several years ago,
a group of us rose up.

14:06.413 --> 14:09.380
We killed the Electus
crew, took the ship.

14:09.382 --> 14:11.082
I don't get it.
If you took the ship--

14:11.084 --> 14:13.885
The leader of the rebellion
was a man named Hansmeed.

14:13.887 --> 14:15.854
He convinced most of
us that our survival

14:15.856 --> 14:18.857
depended on continuing
the experiment.

14:18.859 --> 14:21.359
He said it would
be on our terms.

14:21.361 --> 14:24.963
Let me guess:
ended up being on his.

14:24.965 --> 14:27.432
I couldn't accept it,
so I escaped.

14:27.434 --> 14:30.201
I've been waiting for a chance
to go back and get him.

14:31.071 --> 14:32.503
Please.

14:32.505 --> 14:34.105
He needs help.

14:41.214 --> 14:43.214
He's in rough shape.

14:43.216 --> 14:46.251
At normal recreational levels,
Shadow's not that addictive.

14:46.253 --> 14:47.452
But it looks like they've
been pumping this stuff

14:47.454 --> 14:50.054
in his system for months.

14:50.056 --> 14:52.190
I mean, maybe even years.

14:52.192 --> 14:54.292
Coming off's not gonna be easy.

14:54.294 --> 14:56.127
You have to take me back!

14:56.129 --> 14:57.328
[NYX]
No.

14:57.330 --> 14:59.664
[MILO]
You don't understand.

14:59.666 --> 15:01.633
I have to go back.

15:01.635 --> 15:03.668
That's just the drug talking.

15:03.670 --> 15:07.605
Just--Just give it a chance
to leave your system.

15:07.607 --> 15:08.640
Get your head clear.

15:08.642 --> 15:11.409
[MILO]
Okay...

15:11.411 --> 15:13.378
[DEVON] I'm gonna start an IV,
get some fluids going.

15:13.380 --> 15:15.546
That'll help the process along.

15:25.158 --> 15:26.457
[THREE] You didn't think
this was worth mentioning

15:26.459 --> 15:28.459
before you brought
him on the Marauder?

15:28.461 --> 15:30.128
I didn't have much
time to think.

15:30.130 --> 15:31.029
We had to get out of there.

15:31.031 --> 15:32.096
[THREE]
She lied to us.

15:32.098 --> 15:33.364
It's her brother.

15:33.366 --> 15:34.966
[scoffs]

15:34.968 --> 15:36.167
[TWO]
We got what we came for.

15:36.169 --> 15:37.669
Oh, you're taking
her side now, huh?

15:37.671 --> 15:40.271
I'm just trying to understand.

15:40.273 --> 15:43.574
Anyway, we all have
issues with our past, right?

15:43.576 --> 15:46.010
So, what are we going
to do with them?

15:46.012 --> 15:48.012
[TWO] You don't want
them on the ship? Fine.

15:48.014 --> 15:49.547
We'll sell off the cargo,
give Nyx her fair cut,

15:49.549 --> 15:51.983
and drop them off
the first chance we get.

15:51.985 --> 15:53.084
I am on board with all that

15:53.086 --> 15:55.353
except giving out
shares to liars.

15:55.355 --> 15:59.190
So, um, nothing
for you, then, huh?

16:02.963 --> 16:04.195
Hey!

16:04.197 --> 16:06.497
I haven't lied.

16:06.499 --> 16:08.099
Recently.

16:28.088 --> 16:29.721
Hey.

16:29.723 --> 16:31.322
What you doing down here?

16:31.324 --> 16:33.224
The Android asked me
to run a diagnostic

16:33.226 --> 16:35.760
on the Marauder, see if it
took any serious damage.

16:35.762 --> 16:37.328
[DEVON]
Cool.

16:37.330 --> 16:38.696
What are you doing?

16:38.698 --> 16:40.665
Oh. I need this.

16:42.469 --> 16:44.068
It's for, uh, Nyx's brother.

16:44.070 --> 16:45.503
To wean him off.

16:45.505 --> 16:47.638
Afraid if he goes cold turkey,
he'll have a seizure.

16:47.640 --> 16:50.408
Oh. Okay.

16:50.410 --> 16:52.010
[DEVON]
Yeah. [chuckles]

16:52.011 --> 16:53.611
You guy's still got, like, a
million bars' worth down there,

16:53.613 --> 16:56.748
so, I mean, you'll
get your payday.

16:56.750 --> 16:59.050
I wasn't worried about that.

17:00.487 --> 17:02.253
Oh. Okay.

17:02.255 --> 17:04.288
Um, I gotta...

17:13.366 --> 17:15.767
Hey, we're approaching
the rendezvous location

17:15.769 --> 17:18.736
Devon's black market
contacts gave us.

17:18.738 --> 17:20.571
What's he doing here?

17:20.573 --> 17:22.440
He is flying the Marauder
over to the ship

17:22.442 --> 17:24.542
with the drug dealers
on it to make the trade.

17:24.544 --> 17:26.144
And you're going
with him as backup.

17:26.146 --> 17:28.679
I can fly the Marauder.
Four can be my backup.

17:28.681 --> 17:30.515
He's a better pilot.

17:32.819 --> 17:35.553
Gear up.

17:35.555 --> 17:36.938
[SIX sighs]

17:36.939 --> 17:38.322
If it makes you feel any better,
I think she's just doing this

17:38.324 --> 17:39.791
so I'll be complicit
in the deal.

17:39.793 --> 17:41.392
It doesn't.

17:55.675 --> 17:57.341
--[NYX] Here.
--Thanks.

17:59.379 --> 18:01.345
Look, you don't understand.

18:01.347 --> 18:03.848
I can't stay.

18:03.850 --> 18:06.784
Me being here,
I'm putting you in danger.

18:06.786 --> 18:09.187
Their powers have
grown since you left.

18:09.189 --> 18:11.355
Mostly because of you.

18:11.357 --> 18:14.158
Exactly why they
won't just let me go.

18:16.129 --> 18:17.428
Look.

18:17.430 --> 18:18.830
Here.

18:20.600 --> 18:22.200
Just rest.

18:34.414 --> 18:36.781
Oh, the ship we jacked just
dropped out and opened fire.

18:36.783 --> 18:38.516
We're changing course
and heading back.

18:38.518 --> 18:39.784
That's impossible.

18:39.786 --> 18:41.452
How did they find us?

18:52.899 --> 18:53.831
There go our buyers.

18:53.833 --> 18:55.566
Son of a bitch.

18:59.472 --> 19:03.441
Six, our shields are still
damaged from the last encounter.

19:03.443 --> 19:04.876
We can't take much more of this.

19:04.878 --> 19:06.177
[SIX] All right,
get the Raza outta here.

19:06.178 --> 19:07.477
We'll take the Marauder
down to the planet.

19:07.480 --> 19:09.597
Whoa, whoa. Hang on a second!

19:09.598 --> 19:11.715
[THE ANDROID] The atmosphere
is dense and highly toxic.

19:11.718 --> 19:12.850
I can see that,
but it should make us

19:12.852 --> 19:14.285
untraceable with sensors.

19:14.287 --> 19:15.453
You're not seriously
gonna leave me here

19:15.455 --> 19:16.587
with this guy, are you?!

19:16.589 --> 19:17.855
[TWO]
He's right.

19:17.857 --> 19:19.690
We're not gonna
leave you behind.

19:19.692 --> 19:21.692
You can come back
for us when it's safe.

19:21.694 --> 19:22.827
I've already changed course.

19:22.829 --> 19:23.861
[TWO]
Your call, Marauder.

19:23.863 --> 19:24.862
[THREE groans]

19:24.864 --> 19:26.464
Good luck.

19:41.347 --> 19:43.181
I wanna know what's
really going on.

19:43.183 --> 19:45.583
How the hell did your friends
find out where we were gonna be?

19:45.585 --> 19:47.451
[NYX]
They're not our friends.

19:47.453 --> 19:48.853
I swear.

19:50.957 --> 19:53.524
[THREE] It's actually
getting worse out there.

19:53.526 --> 19:55.726
[SIX]
Extremely high acid content.

19:55.728 --> 19:57.328
That rain will melt
the flesh off your bones

19:57.330 --> 19:58.630
in under a minute.

19:58.631 --> 19:59.931
[THREE] Whose brilliant
idea was this again?

19:59.932 --> 20:01.232
Look, if we'd tried to dock,
the Raza could have been

20:01.234 --> 20:02.700
blasted outta the sky.

20:02.702 --> 20:03.868
[THREE]
Or we coulda made it on time.

20:03.870 --> 20:06.270
It wasn't worth the risk.

20:07.874 --> 20:09.774
God, I hate being blind.

20:10.944 --> 20:13.911
Sure, they can't see us,
but we can't see them either.

20:13.913 --> 20:16.614
When the Raza returns,
they'll scan for the other ship,

20:16.616 --> 20:18.316
and then they'll send us
a subspace communication

20:18.318 --> 20:19.784
to let us know
if the coast is clear.

20:19.786 --> 20:21.752
Assuming they make it on time.

20:21.754 --> 20:23.221
They'll make it.

20:23.223 --> 20:25.790
In the meantime, all we
have to do is sit tight.

20:25.792 --> 20:27.491
We'll be fine.

20:27.827 --> 20:29.427
[thunder booms]

20:38.938 --> 20:40.771
Do you ever get tired
of being wrong?

20:43.876 --> 20:45.977
[NYX] Electus discovered that
some of the people on our planet

20:45.979 --> 20:48.246
had a genetic mutation.

20:48.248 --> 20:51.716
It gave them enhanced levels
of what they call C.P.A.

20:51.718 --> 20:54.986
Cognitive Predictive Ability.

20:54.988 --> 20:56.988
Everyone has it to some degree.

20:56.990 --> 20:59.257
Most people call it "Intuition."

20:59.259 --> 21:00.508
"A gut feeling."

21:00.509 --> 21:01.758
Like when you feel
someone behind you

21:01.761 --> 21:03.327
before you turn around.

21:03.329 --> 21:04.895
It's a long way
from a gut feeling

21:04.897 --> 21:06.864
to accurately predicting
where a ship is going to appear

21:06.866 --> 21:08.399
in the galaxy.

21:08.401 --> 21:10.801
Well, that's where
the machine comes in.

21:10.803 --> 21:13.304
That room you saw,
with all those people.

21:13.306 --> 21:14.839
[MILO]
They're linked together to form

21:14.841 --> 21:16.941
a collective consciousness.

21:16.943 --> 21:19.427
It's horrible.

21:19.428 --> 21:21.912
It's like drowning in
an ocean of a thousand voices.

21:21.914 --> 21:23.714
You can't block them out.

21:23.716 --> 21:26.384
So they give you the drugs
to make it easier.

21:26.386 --> 21:29.487
Well, it also helps the Seers
access their subconscious minds,

21:29.489 --> 21:31.389
and link them to the collective.

21:31.391 --> 21:32.523
"Seers"?

21:32.525 --> 21:34.292
[NYX]
It's what they call themselves.

21:34.294 --> 21:38.329
The Seers go into the machine,
and then they feed them data.

21:38.331 --> 21:39.463
Huge amounts.

21:39.465 --> 21:41.565
The galaxy is awash
with information.

21:41.567 --> 21:42.800
It's everywhere.

21:42.802 --> 21:44.502
It's just a matter
of tapping in.

21:44.504 --> 21:48.539
And if you analyze enough data,
you can predict the future?

21:48.541 --> 21:50.508
It's calculating probability.

21:50.510 --> 21:52.476
Nothing more.

21:52.478 --> 21:55.079
So they knew I was on this ship.

21:55.081 --> 21:57.448
They have my criminal
records, known associates.

21:57.450 --> 21:59.383
And they calculated
the most likely place

21:59.385 --> 22:01.052
you'd go to sell the drugs.

22:01.054 --> 22:03.888
Why didn't they see us coming
when we attacked their ship?

22:03.890 --> 22:05.523
I saw it coming.

22:05.525 --> 22:06.957
But I manipulated
the data stream

22:06.959 --> 22:08.526
within the collective.

22:08.528 --> 22:10.761
You can do that?

22:10.763 --> 22:13.798
Milo is the most
talented Seer they have.

22:13.800 --> 22:15.700
They're working with old data.

22:15.702 --> 22:17.535
They're making calculations
based off of previous

22:17.537 --> 22:19.770
behavior patterns.

22:19.772 --> 22:23.474
They thought you would
abandon Nyx, not help her.

22:23.476 --> 22:24.742
Well, if that's true,
they probably don't

22:24.744 --> 22:27.511
think we'll go back
for Three and Six then.

22:27.513 --> 22:29.480
Except you did help us.

22:29.482 --> 22:31.048
That'll affect the model.

22:31.050 --> 22:33.384
What do they want?

22:33.386 --> 22:35.419
They want Milo back.

22:35.421 --> 22:36.721
[THE ANDROID]
Based on our sensor analysis,

22:36.723 --> 22:38.589
the Marauder will not
hold up in the atmosphere

22:38.591 --> 22:41.092
of that planet for
more than 24 hours.

22:41.094 --> 22:42.493
[FIVE]
We have to go back.

22:42.494 --> 22:43.893
[TWO] If the Seers
predict we're gonna do that,

22:43.896 --> 22:45.596
they'll be there waiting for us.

22:45.598 --> 22:47.465
Our shields can't
handle another battle.

22:47.467 --> 22:49.633
[FIVE] We can try to
shore things up best we can.

22:49.635 --> 22:51.669
We could try a lot of things.

22:51.671 --> 22:54.472
Sell the drugs somewhere else.
Get the shields repaired.

22:54.474 --> 22:56.007
[FIVE]
In time?

22:56.008 --> 22:57.541
If what Nyx says is true,
they'll likely anticipate

22:57.543 --> 23:00.044
our next move, whatever it is.

23:00.046 --> 23:02.813
I don't see how they can
know what we're going to do,

23:02.815 --> 23:05.516
because even I don't
know what we're gonna do.

23:06.986 --> 23:11.622
[NYX] I just want to apologize
for not telling you the truth.

23:13.126 --> 23:15.893
I understand why you did it.

23:15.895 --> 23:17.528
He's your brother.

23:17.530 --> 23:19.530
[NYX]
Yes, and he's all I have.

23:20.566 --> 23:22.733
But he can't stay here.

23:22.735 --> 23:26.170
Sending him back will
only make them stronger.

23:26.973 --> 23:29.640
I never said we
should send him back.

23:29.642 --> 23:32.410
You mean drop us on a planet?

23:32.412 --> 23:34.779
They'll hunt us,
and they won't stop.

23:34.781 --> 23:36.447
Maybe we can stay
one step ahead of them,

23:36.449 --> 23:38.082
but we'll always be on the run.

23:38.084 --> 23:40.851
So what are you asking of me?

23:40.853 --> 23:43.587
I'm asking you to talk to Milo.

23:43.589 --> 23:46.690
Get to know him a little.
While we have time.

23:46.692 --> 23:48.275
Why?

23:48.276 --> 23:49.859
[NYX] I'm hoping you can
help me convince the others

23:49.862 --> 23:52.196
to let us stay.

23:52.198 --> 23:54.498
He's not physical like me.

23:54.500 --> 23:56.200
He's not a fighter.

23:56.202 --> 24:00.104
But he can detect patterns,
manipulate information,

24:00.106 --> 24:03.774
see things that
other people won't see.

24:03.776 --> 24:05.509
It could be useful.

24:07.613 --> 24:12.082
If you stay on board,
they will come after all of us.

24:12.084 --> 24:14.819
The Raza is capable
of fighting back.

24:14.821 --> 24:17.221
Are you asking us
to destroy the Seers?

24:17.223 --> 24:19.557
[NYX] I'm asking you
to make them think twice

24:19.559 --> 24:22.026
about ever coming
after us again.

24:46.085 --> 24:48.786
The Raza crew's
next course of action

24:48.788 --> 24:50.521
has been determined.

25:02.702 --> 25:04.802
I've reconfigured
the shields the best I can

25:04.804 --> 25:06.537
without any new parts.

25:06.539 --> 25:08.856
How much can they withstand?

25:08.857 --> 25:11.174
[THE ANDROID]
Not more than a few direct hits.

25:11.177 --> 25:14.144
So not enough to go head-to-head
with that Seer ship again.

25:14.146 --> 25:16.614
The Marauder can only
stay hidden on that planet

25:16.616 --> 25:19.583
for another ten hours.

25:19.585 --> 25:21.819
If the Seers think we're
going back for Six and Three,

25:21.821 --> 25:23.654
they'll be there waiting for us.

25:23.656 --> 25:24.889
If they think we'll
leave them there to die,

25:24.891 --> 25:26.290
they'll probably be
at the next station

25:26.292 --> 25:28.092
we try to dock at.

25:28.094 --> 25:31.095
[THE ANDROID] There's no point
in second-guessing yourself.

25:32.965 --> 25:34.164
Do you think if
I do the opposite

25:34.166 --> 25:35.900
of what I want to do
just to outsmart them,

25:35.902 --> 25:38.068
they'll be able to
anticipate that?

25:38.070 --> 25:40.838
I believe the old saying is,
"Damned if you do."

25:43.009 --> 25:44.642
They can't read my mind.

25:44.644 --> 25:46.043
[THE ANDROID]
No.

25:52.051 --> 25:58.188
If I may ask,
what are you going to do?

25:58.190 --> 25:59.924
I don't know yet.

25:59.926 --> 26:02.026
But I hate being predictable.

26:02.028 --> 26:05.162
Two, you're anything
but predictable.

26:09.602 --> 26:11.869
[THREE]
This is all your fault.

26:11.871 --> 26:13.337
[SIX]
I made a judgment call.

26:13.339 --> 26:15.673
If I had to do it
again, I would.

26:17.977 --> 26:20.711
What is it exactly you're
hoping to do down there?

26:20.713 --> 26:22.112
I'm hoping the only
real damage was to

26:22.114 --> 26:23.847
the internal power coupling.

26:23.849 --> 26:27.751
If it's something on the outside
of the ship, we're screwed.

26:30.823 --> 26:32.222
Great.

27:07.159 --> 27:11.195
One of the last fresh
pieces of fruit on board.

27:11.197 --> 27:13.864
I'm not hungry.

27:16.369 --> 27:20.938
Now, Nyx wants us
to fight the Seers.

27:22.008 --> 27:24.675
That would be unwise.

27:24.677 --> 27:26.310
Because you already
know the outcome?

27:26.312 --> 27:28.412
Because I know how
powerful they are.

27:30.282 --> 27:33.183
If I showed you a history
of my home planet...

27:36.889 --> 27:39.189
Given enough time
and enough data,

27:39.191 --> 27:42.126
I could tell you what would
most likely happen there.

27:47.667 --> 27:49.400
I'm gonna leave
the rest for you.

27:57.176 --> 28:00.711
Based on what you've learned,
what do you predict will happen

28:00.713 --> 28:02.713
on board this ship?

28:04.984 --> 28:07.351
Two will go back
to rescue Six and Three,

28:07.353 --> 28:10.087
even if it means
risking the Raza.

28:10.089 --> 28:11.288
I already know that.

28:11.290 --> 28:13.190
Tell me something I don't know.

28:17.697 --> 28:19.863
One of you will
betray the others.

28:19.865 --> 28:21.265
That's already happened.

28:21.267 --> 28:23.801
[MILO]
I'm not talking about the past.

28:23.803 --> 28:25.836
I'm saying it'll happen again.

28:27.306 --> 28:29.239
Sometime in the near future.

28:43.222 --> 28:44.755
This better work.

28:44.757 --> 28:46.790
I don't want to die
stuck on this rock with you.

28:46.792 --> 28:49.226
But if it was with
someone else, it'd be okay?

28:49.228 --> 28:51.128
Yeah, that'd be better.

28:51.130 --> 28:54.064
Well, since there is a chance
we're gonna die together,

28:54.066 --> 28:56.066
just so you know,
for the record,

28:56.068 --> 28:57.101
I'm not buying it.

28:57.103 --> 28:58.168
What're you talking about?

28:58.170 --> 28:59.436
[SIX]
Oh, this whole

28:59.438 --> 29:01.438
"Tough guy, always in it
for himself" routine.

29:01.440 --> 29:03.062
Shut up.

29:03.063 --> 29:04.685
[SIX] I think you know
taking our chances down here

29:04.686 --> 29:06.308
to protect the Raza
was the right call.

29:06.312 --> 29:08.312
In fact, I think if you'd
been in the pilot seat,

29:08.314 --> 29:10.147
you'd have done
the exact same thing.

29:10.149 --> 29:11.665
Not a chance.

29:11.666 --> 29:13.182
[SIX] You're just looking
for an excuse to be mad at me.

29:13.185 --> 29:14.485
[THREE]
I don't need an excuse.

29:14.486 --> 29:15.786
I got a damn good
reason as it is.

29:15.788 --> 29:17.454
[SIX] All right,
you want me to say it?!

29:17.456 --> 29:19.256
I'll say it.

29:19.258 --> 29:21.391
I'm sorry I turned you in.

29:22.495 --> 29:25.395
[SIX]
It was a mistake.

29:25.397 --> 29:26.997
Didn't know who I was.

29:28.768 --> 29:30.167
Now I do.

29:44.550 --> 29:45.883
If you're expecting
a "Thank you,"

29:45.885 --> 29:47.551
you can forget about it.

29:49.288 --> 29:50.521
Well, the hull's
obviously taking damage

29:50.523 --> 29:52.422
faster than we thought.

29:52.424 --> 29:54.324
We can either stay
down here and wait to die,

29:54.326 --> 29:57.161
or we can take
our chances up there.

29:57.163 --> 29:59.396
This time, I'll let
you make the call.

30:01.333 --> 30:03.267
Let's get the hell outta here.

30:07.973 --> 30:10.040
[NYX]
Hey.

30:10.042 --> 30:13.177
I brought someone to meet you.

30:13.179 --> 30:15.946
This is Five, another
member of our crew.

30:15.948 --> 30:17.014
Hello.

30:17.016 --> 30:19.016
Hi.

30:19.018 --> 30:20.417
Come.

30:23.889 --> 30:25.322
So, how are you feeling?

30:25.324 --> 30:28.125
Much better now, thanks.

30:29.228 --> 30:32.529
It must have been terrible,
what was happening to you

30:32.531 --> 30:35.566
on that ship.

30:35.568 --> 30:38.969
You'd be surprised
what people can get used to.

30:40.506 --> 30:43.540
Do you mind if
I ask you a question?

30:43.542 --> 30:45.309
About the future?

30:45.311 --> 30:48.245
Yeah, sort of.

30:48.247 --> 30:51.949
See, all of us are
trying to figure out

30:51.951 --> 30:54.151
what we should do next.

30:54.153 --> 30:56.386
Not just about you,
but everything.

30:57.923 --> 30:59.990
And what do you think?

30:59.992 --> 31:02.226
I think we could
make a difference.

31:04.196 --> 31:07.030
But that's crazy, right?

31:07.032 --> 31:09.433
'Cause we're just a bunch
of misfits on one ship,

31:09.435 --> 31:14.938
and most of the time, we can't
even get along with each other.

31:14.940 --> 31:18.208
Well, you'd be
surprised about that, too.

31:18.210 --> 31:20.544
What do you mean?

31:20.546 --> 31:22.646
[MILO] Well, all our
predictive models suggest

31:22.648 --> 31:25.449
that a major paradigm
shift is coming.

31:25.451 --> 31:28.385
And the most likely scenario
is all-out corporate war

31:28.387 --> 31:31.255
within the next six months.

31:31.257 --> 31:32.122
Oh my god.

31:32.124 --> 31:34.024
[MILO]
I know.

31:34.026 --> 31:36.426
It sounds bad.

31:36.428 --> 31:39.363
But you have to
understand something.

31:39.365 --> 31:43.133
It's times like these,
when longstanding patterns

31:43.135 --> 31:49.239
are disrupted, that things
become more fluid.

31:49.241 --> 31:52.676
That's when a small
group of people,

31:52.678 --> 31:58.982
or even a single individual, can
change the course of history.

32:00.386 --> 32:03.220
[TWO]
Five, where are you?

32:03.222 --> 32:05.222
I'm with Nyx and Milo.

32:05.224 --> 32:06.373
[TWO]
Good.

32:06.374 --> 32:07.523
I need you all on the bridge.

32:14.566 --> 32:18.168
All right, no sign
of the enemy ship.

32:18.170 --> 32:20.103
But I am detecting
an FTL window.

32:24.109 --> 32:25.642
I'm picking up the Marauder.

32:25.644 --> 32:27.077
[SIX]
Raza, come in?

32:27.079 --> 32:29.012
Six, this is Two. We read you.

32:29.014 --> 32:31.081
--[THREE chuckles]
--Nice to see you guys.

32:31.083 --> 32:34.084
No time for tearful reunions.
Get your asses back on board.

32:34.086 --> 32:35.485
Copy that.

32:39.091 --> 32:40.724
For what it's worth, I'm never
really gonna forgive you

32:40.726 --> 32:42.492
for what you did.

32:42.494 --> 32:44.778
Didn't expect you would.

32:44.779 --> 32:47.063
And I don't really trust
that you're actually one of us.

32:47.066 --> 32:48.465
I know.

32:50.436 --> 32:52.569
But I'm willing to
give you a shot to prove it.

33:05.351 --> 33:07.184
Our shields are nearly depleted.

33:07.186 --> 33:08.752
We can't take much more.

33:08.754 --> 33:10.287
The Marauder?

33:10.289 --> 33:11.455
[FIVE]
Uh, they just docked.

33:11.457 --> 33:12.356
Bay doors closed.

33:12.358 --> 33:13.557
We can jump.

33:13.559 --> 33:14.558
And then what?

33:14.560 --> 33:16.259
They'll just find us again.

33:16.261 --> 33:17.661
What else can we do?

33:22.167 --> 33:24.267
Trust me.

33:24.269 --> 33:27.104
Give me a channel
to the Seer ship.

33:27.106 --> 33:28.438
[THE ANDROID]
Very well.

33:28.440 --> 33:30.040
Channel open.

33:31.276 --> 33:33.710
This is the Raza.
Our shields are down.

33:33.712 --> 33:37.147
If you hit us with another shot,
you will destroy us.

33:37.149 --> 33:41.018
Turn over the cargo
you stole from us.

33:41.020 --> 33:42.552
I don't think so.

33:42.554 --> 33:44.321
I'm told you already
know what's gonna happen,

33:44.323 --> 33:47.591
but just in case,
let me lay it out for you.

33:47.593 --> 33:48.692
We're gonna keep
this bit of cargo,

33:48.694 --> 33:50.360
and you're gonna let us go.

33:50.362 --> 33:51.561
And then you're gonna
go on your merry way,

33:51.563 --> 33:53.563
and never bother us again.

33:53.565 --> 33:56.066
Why would I do that?

33:56.068 --> 33:57.434
Because...

33:57.436 --> 33:58.919
...I'm about to take
the one thing

33:58.920 --> 34:00.403
you really want out
of the equation.

34:08.514 --> 34:11.081
Please. No.

34:11.083 --> 34:15.619
[HANSMEED] If you kill him,
we will destroy you.

34:15.621 --> 34:17.454
[TWO]
We're ready to jump to FTL.

34:17.456 --> 34:18.655
I just wanna show you
that there's no point

34:18.657 --> 34:20.724
in continuing to come after us.

34:20.726 --> 34:22.492
But if you do,
the next time you see us,

34:22.494 --> 34:24.828
I promise you, we will be ready.

34:24.830 --> 34:27.631
[HANSMEED] I know you don't
have any friends to turn to.

34:27.633 --> 34:29.366
You can't hide.

34:29.368 --> 34:32.302
We will find you.

34:32.304 --> 34:34.604
Do you really want to make
an enemy of the Raza?

34:34.606 --> 34:36.440
[HANSMEED]
Turn over the young man.

34:36.442 --> 34:37.441
And the cargo.

34:37.443 --> 34:39.709
The rest of you are free to go.

34:39.711 --> 34:41.845
Two, don't do this.

34:41.847 --> 34:44.648
I already know you
won't pull the trigger.

34:44.650 --> 34:47.084
You will do as I say.

34:51.223 --> 34:52.656
I'm sorry.

34:52.658 --> 34:54.357
He was right, I wasn't
gonna pull the trigger.

34:54.359 --> 34:56.359
Yeah, I know.

34:56.360 --> 34:58.360
[TWO] I had to take the chance
that he might think I would.

34:58.363 --> 34:59.729
I have to go back.

34:59.731 --> 35:01.231
No.

35:01.233 --> 35:02.833
Nyx, there's no other way.

35:11.610 --> 35:13.610
What? Nyx, what?

35:13.612 --> 35:15.312
I can't let them send you back.

35:15.314 --> 35:16.713
[MILO] They're not sending
me anywhere, Nyx.

35:16.715 --> 35:18.181
I'm choosing to go.

35:18.183 --> 35:20.250
--What other choice do we have?
--We can fight!

35:20.252 --> 35:21.751
We will.

35:21.753 --> 35:23.120
Both of us.

35:23.122 --> 35:24.688
What're you talking about?

35:24.690 --> 35:27.491
I meant what I said to Five.

35:27.493 --> 35:31.528
Okay? This crew has a role
to play in what's coming.

35:31.530 --> 35:33.864
The future of the galaxy
is in the balance,

35:33.866 --> 35:35.732
and what happens
aboard this ship

35:35.734 --> 35:38.435
could tip the scales, okay?

35:38.437 --> 35:42.405
That's why I can't just
let you sacrifice yourselves.

35:42.407 --> 35:43.874
What about you?

35:47.913 --> 35:51.181
I can change things.

35:51.183 --> 35:52.282
From the inside.

35:52.284 --> 35:53.683
I can...

35:55.220 --> 35:58.522
...feed them false conclusions.

35:58.524 --> 36:02.192
Maybe I can convince
others to join me.

36:03.495 --> 36:04.895
[MILO]
We've already had one rebellion.

36:04.897 --> 36:06.329
Who says we can't
have another, huh?!

36:06.331 --> 36:08.465
That's not possible.

36:09.935 --> 36:11.868
Don't underestimate me.

36:13.872 --> 36:16.406
You're just saying that
to make me feel better.

36:18.677 --> 36:20.377
It's time to go.

36:40.399 --> 36:42.432
[THREE] Man, they are gonna be
pissed that we are only

36:42.434 --> 36:43.767
sending back half the cargo.

36:43.769 --> 36:45.368
[TWO] We gotta get
something out of it.

36:45.370 --> 36:46.736
They probably know
we're gonna short 'em.

36:46.738 --> 36:48.738
They just want Milo back.

36:48.740 --> 36:50.157
We rescued him once.

36:50.158 --> 36:51.575
We can go after him
again, another time,

36:51.577 --> 36:53.243
when we're good and ready.

36:53.245 --> 36:55.028
[TWO] Next time, they're
gonna see us coming.

36:55.029 --> 36:56.812
[THREE] Yeah, how do you fight
an enemy that knows the future?

36:56.815 --> 36:58.748
[SIX] Look, I'm sorry,
but knowing we're coming

36:58.750 --> 37:00.517
doesn't necessarily mean
they'll be able to stop us.

37:05.290 --> 37:06.556
[MILO] I'm sorry
I didn't get to analyze

37:06.558 --> 37:08.458
the history of your planet.

37:08.460 --> 37:09.659
[FOUR] Would my
knowing what will happen

37:09.661 --> 37:10.961
change the outcome?

37:10.963 --> 37:12.729
[MILO]
Sometimes it does.

37:12.731 --> 37:14.931
I factor that in.

37:14.933 --> 37:16.466
What will the Seers do next?

37:16.468 --> 37:19.236
Short term, they plan
to acquire more ships.

37:19.238 --> 37:20.971
Enslave more people.

37:20.972 --> 37:22.705
Eventually, they plan
to build an entire fleet.

37:22.708 --> 37:25.375
If they get that far,
they'll be unstoppable.

37:27.813 --> 37:30.313
I heard what you said to Nyx.

37:30.315 --> 37:32.249
About leading a revolt?

37:32.251 --> 37:34.551
You don't really
believe it's possible.

37:35.921 --> 37:37.554
No.

37:37.556 --> 37:40.624
No outcome is a certainty.

37:40.626 --> 37:44.527
However small the
odds are, I have to try.

37:44.529 --> 37:46.529
Chances are greater that they
will eventually turn you

37:46.531 --> 37:48.331
to their side.

37:49.935 --> 37:53.303
Well, this is my only choice.

37:54.373 --> 37:56.439
No.

37:56.441 --> 37:57.841
There is another way.

38:08.787 --> 38:10.887
How we doing?

38:10.889 --> 38:12.822
The Marauder has returned.

38:12.824 --> 38:14.057
[SIX]
We're docked.

38:14.059 --> 38:16.660
Any comment about
the size of the cargo?

38:16.662 --> 38:17.894
[SIX]
Negative.

38:17.896 --> 38:19.896
Good. Let's jump.

39:36.575 --> 39:40.677
You should know, we're aware
you manipulated information

39:40.679 --> 39:45.648
in the data stream
to influence our conclusions.

39:49.988 --> 39:51.588
It's all right.

39:53.024 --> 39:54.624
[HANSMEED]
I forgive you.

39:55.961 --> 39:58.428
But don't try it again.

39:59.498 --> 40:02.432
[HANSMEED]
I'll be watching.

40:02.434 --> 40:04.534
Now, rest up.

40:04.536 --> 40:07.170
You go back in with
the next shift.

40:14.479 --> 40:17.847
I know you don't
believe it right now,

40:17.849 --> 40:20.817
but one day, you will see.

40:20.819 --> 40:23.086
This is for the best.

40:23.088 --> 40:25.688
We are the future.

40:46.812 --> 40:48.211
Open it.

41:26.751 --> 41:28.651
[sobs quietly]

41:34.693 --> 41:36.526
[NYX]
You want some company?

41:36.528 --> 41:37.760
[FOUR]
Up to you.

41:37.762 --> 41:39.229
[NYX]
I guess I do.

41:52.777 --> 41:54.711
Thank you.

41:54.713 --> 41:56.546
For what?

41:56.548 --> 41:59.616
Taking the time
to get to know Milo.

41:59.618 --> 42:01.284
I know you didn't
have much time.

42:03.221 --> 42:05.121
For being my friend.

42:10.762 --> 42:12.195
Shall we continue?

42:23.975 --> 42:25.675
Ah... Ah!
