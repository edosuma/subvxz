00:01.000 --> 00:04.562
You probably think you've heard
it all. But this story's different.

00:04.671 --> 00:09.631
It begins pretty much the typical way.
Boy meets girl, boy proposes to girl,

00:09.709 --> 00:11.836
boy sees George Michael
in his apartment.

00:11.911 --> 00:14.846
Boy gets diagnosed with
an inoperable brain aneurysm.

00:14.914 --> 00:16.472
You didn't see that coming.

00:16.549 --> 00:17.675
Wait. Gets better.

00:17.751 --> 00:20.276
Boy meets acupuncturist
who's convinced the boy

00:20.353 --> 00:22.514
is the 21st-century equivalent of Moses.

00:22.589 --> 00:25.353
But instead of parting seas
and smashing tablets,

00:25.425 --> 00:28.861
Boy must somehow interpret
and follow the visions he's having

00:28.928 --> 00:31.829
and fix the world one lawsuit at a time.

00:31.898 --> 00:35.834
Needless to say, it's put a bit
of a stress on, well, everything.

00:35.902 --> 00:38.336
But mostly, boy's relationship.

00:38.405 --> 00:41.738
Which is why I'm returning this.
It's a sad story, right?

00:41.808 --> 00:44.902
- Do you have a receipt, sir?
- I told you I can't find it.

00:44.978 --> 00:48.311
I didn't think I'd be returning
my fiancÃ©e's engagement ring.

00:48.381 --> 00:51.908
- Can't you check your records?
- You still need proof of purchase.

00:56.990 --> 00:59.424
That'll teach you
not to pay retail.

00:59.492 --> 01:01.153
Sure you don't need a ring?

01:01.227 --> 01:04.196
Not presently, but when I do,
I'll be sure to keep my receipt.

01:04.297 --> 01:05.992
I miss Taylor, Nate.

01:06.066 --> 01:09.729
Good to know nothing's changed
since you said that five minutes ago.

01:09.803 --> 01:12.294
Maybe I did the wrong thing
breaking up with her.

01:12.372 --> 01:15.739
Let me provide clarity here.
You did do the wrong thing, buttwipe.

01:15.809 --> 01:18.869
If I didn't end it, she'd end up
shackled to a crazy person.

01:18.945 --> 01:20.913
And a dweeb, but that is her decision.

01:20.980 --> 01:25.007
Get her back before you become even
more pathetic than you actually are.

01:25.085 --> 01:29.021
- What is that supposed to mean?
- Eli, you are the worst bachelor ever.

01:29.089 --> 01:32.752
Instead of hooking up with old
girlfriends, of which there's not many,

01:32.826 --> 01:35.192
you break out the microwave popcorn

01:35.295 --> 01:39.163
and spend your nights in bed watching
reruns of TV movies on WE Network.

01:39.232 --> 01:41.792
I'm not in bed.
Shows how much you know.

01:41.901 --> 01:45.268
Look, I gotta get some sleep.
I got rounds in less than six hours.

01:45.338 --> 01:47.363
- Help me, Stone.
- What'd you say?

01:47.440 --> 01:49.408
Nothing. Good night, little brother.

01:49.509 --> 01:50.976
Help me, Stone.

01:52.378 --> 01:53.868
Help me, Stone.

01:53.947 --> 01:56.711
- Oh, no.
- Help me, Stone.

01:56.783 --> 01:59.911
- Help me, Stone.
- Oh, no, no, no, no!

01:59.986 --> 02:01.248
No, no, no, no!

02:02.322 --> 02:03.653
Help me...

02:06.793 --> 02:08.556
- Help me, Stone.
- No!

02:08.661 --> 02:10.322
Get back in the TV.

02:10.395 --> 02:12.330
Help me.

02:12.932 --> 02:15.628
Help me. Please, Stone.
Help me.

02:28.014 --> 02:29.572
He came out of the television.

02:29.682 --> 02:33.140
- Like that creepy chick in The Ring?
- He didn't climb out exactly.

02:33.219 --> 02:36.154
First he was on TV,
then he appeared in my apartment.

02:36.222 --> 02:39.783
Everybody comes to your apartment.
George Michael, boys' choir.

02:39.859 --> 02:42.828
- I'm insulted I haven't been invited.
- I'm not inviting.

02:42.929 --> 02:44.658
I don't even know who this guy is.

02:44.731 --> 02:46.460
- Does he look familiar?
- No!

02:46.533 --> 02:49.161
How am I supposed to help a guy
I've never even met?

02:49.235 --> 02:52.170
Like, taking an ad out in the paper?
Police sketch?

02:52.238 --> 02:55.002
This is clearly
a W-and-S kind of vision.

02:55.842 --> 02:59.175
- Wait and see.
- You've categorized my visions?

02:59.245 --> 03:02.544
Look at my herb shelf.
I'm a little OCD with the labeling.

03:02.615 --> 03:05.345
Now beat it. I have to get into
character for my 9:00.

03:05.418 --> 03:08.319
- But...
- Wait and see.

03:09.322 --> 03:10.653
OK.

03:10.723 --> 03:13.487
Eli is a remarkable young man.

03:13.593 --> 03:17.654
I thought we dropped the formality of
being diplomatic decades ago, Mason.

03:17.730 --> 03:20.995
He certainly made for an eventful
engagement party.

03:21.067 --> 03:25.026
Taylor's taste in men has always been
a few steps beyond my comprehension.

03:25.104 --> 03:26.594
Allow me to enlighten.

03:26.673 --> 03:29.608
She loves Eli because
she sees you in him.

03:29.676 --> 03:31.837
Your spirit, your intellect.

03:31.945 --> 03:34.413
- Your Ginsu-sharp legal mind.
- Hmm.

03:34.480 --> 03:38.814
If I didn't know you any better, I'd say
you were buttering me up for something.

03:38.885 --> 03:42.753
As it turns out, there is a legal matter
we'd been handling in-house.

03:42.822 --> 03:45.791
But since the EEOC has allowed
the claim to go forward,

03:45.892 --> 03:48.554
it's time for me to retain
outside counsel.

03:48.628 --> 03:51.995
- The EEOC? What's the claim?
- Discriminatory hiring practices.

03:52.065 --> 03:56.092
The plaintiff is a young lawyer
we interviewed but didn't hire.

03:56.169 --> 03:58.399
I ultimately didn't hire.

03:58.471 --> 04:00.962
So she goes and files
a discrimination claim?

04:01.040 --> 04:03.372
- He did, actually.
- Is he gay?

04:03.443 --> 04:04.876
Not as far as I know.

04:04.944 --> 04:07.435
Sorry, I don't understand.
What's he alleging?

04:07.513 --> 04:09.481
Racism.

04:09.582 --> 04:12.107
He claims I didn't hire him
because he's black.

04:19.993 --> 04:22.154
Get away. I'm having
a really lousy week.

04:22.262 --> 04:25.823
- Maybe I can help. My plate's clean.
- No one else will work with you.

04:25.932 --> 04:27.160
What are you working on?

04:27.233 --> 04:30.464
I need a restraining order petitioned.
You know how to draft one?

04:30.536 --> 04:33.471
- Who are the parties?
- I'm seeking the TRO personally.

04:33.539 --> 04:36.667
- Really? Against who?
- Maggie Dekker. That's two K's.

04:36.743 --> 04:38.870
Good morning!

04:39.712 --> 04:41.680
Beautiful day, isn't it?

04:41.781 --> 04:43.646
Oh, my God, someone told you.

04:43.716 --> 04:47.152
I heard from Denise in HR,
but I confirmed with Larry in Tech.

04:47.220 --> 04:49.245
I was afraid it was too good to be true.

04:50.223 --> 04:53.488
Larry in Tech knows I broke up
with Taylor? Does Jordan know?

04:53.559 --> 04:56.119
I'm not sure, but I'd be happy
to tell him myself.

04:56.229 --> 04:58.129
- Let me try his extension.
- Patti!

04:58.197 --> 05:01.963
I broke up with Taylor because
of my aneurysm. If she told Jordan that,

05:02.035 --> 05:05.004
that would be antithetical
to continued employment here.

05:05.104 --> 05:07.072
Only you could dump the boss' daughter

05:07.140 --> 05:09.631
and worry about getting fired
for something else.

05:09.709 --> 05:12.473
You gotta suss out
what Taylor told Jordan.

05:12.545 --> 05:13.910
Call her assistant.

05:13.980 --> 05:17.472
Or you're seeing Jordan
at the staff meeting.

05:18.251 --> 05:21.709
Why don't you suss it out for yourself?

05:30.997 --> 05:32.328
Mr. Stone.

05:33.666 --> 05:34.997
Good morning, sir. Fine.

05:35.935 --> 05:39.598
- I mean, I'm fine, sir. How are you?
- Things could be better.

05:39.672 --> 05:42.607
New matter. We're being retained
by Mason Andrews.

05:42.675 --> 05:46.008
- The Mason Andrews?
- There's only one I'm aware of.

05:46.079 --> 05:47.808
I need a second chair.

05:48.915 --> 05:51.679
Mr. Stone, you're not volunteering.

05:51.751 --> 05:53.275
I wasn't sure if...

05:54.020 --> 05:56.511
I thought under the circumstances...

05:56.589 --> 06:00.320
I'm sure Mr. Andrews would be
well-served by such eloquence.

06:06.099 --> 06:07.191
Mr. Stone?

06:09.035 --> 06:10.195
What is it now?

06:11.270 --> 06:14.239
Man, I gotta start bringing
my camcorder to these meetings.

06:14.307 --> 06:16.036
I think I ate some bad sushi.

06:16.109 --> 06:17.736
It's 10:00 in the morning.

06:20.380 --> 06:22.507
Would you excuse me for a minute?

06:23.583 --> 06:26.143
- I have to do something!
- I'm with a patient, Eli.

06:26.219 --> 06:27.846
- I'm a patient too.
- Not right now.

06:27.920 --> 06:30.081
Write me a prescription
for sleeping pills...

06:30.189 --> 06:33.124
Beg for Taylor's forgiveness
and call me in the morning.

06:34.060 --> 06:36.187
Jake, I'm so sorry about that.

06:39.932 --> 06:44.096
Please ignore him. My little brother,
attached to my hip since I was three.

06:44.170 --> 06:47.105
Every time I have him removed,
he grows back.

06:47.173 --> 06:49.869
It's OK. Nice to meet you.

06:51.344 --> 06:52.606
I'm Jake McCann.

06:54.747 --> 06:56.112
Eli.

06:57.150 --> 06:58.811
Eli Stone.

07:13.966 --> 07:16.332
What's going on?
Why do you care so much?

07:16.436 --> 07:17.994
The guy just woke up from a coma.

07:18.104 --> 07:20.595
Wait, he woke up from a?
Jake McCann is Coma Guy.

07:20.673 --> 07:23.904
You're treating Coma Guy!
Chen was right. I saw him on Kimmel...

07:23.976 --> 07:27.309
- Good Morning America. Who is Chen?
- Doesn't matter. Ask him...

07:27.380 --> 07:29.348
No, he does not need a lawyer, Eli.

07:29.449 --> 07:31.917
He was in a coma.
Comas don't happen by accident.

07:31.984 --> 07:35.681
In this case, they do. He fell
off his roof cleaning his gutter.

07:35.755 --> 07:39.657
Ask if he has any legal problems.
He doesn't, I'll leave you two alone.

07:39.725 --> 07:42.819
If this ends up in a malpractice suit
I'm gonna kill you.

07:42.895 --> 07:45.125
Where's your representation,
Mr. Bennett?

07:45.198 --> 07:46.165
I'm pro se.

07:46.265 --> 07:49.132
Didn't spend three years in law school
to pay some guy what I can do for free.

07:49.202 --> 07:51.329
What's that? Lose spectacularly?

07:51.404 --> 07:52.962
Matt Dowd, right?

07:53.072 --> 07:56.940
Didn't you get spanked for five mil
by a lawyer in your own firm?

07:58.411 --> 07:59.901
Let's talk about a trial date.

07:59.979 --> 08:02.470
We don't think you want
to take this matter to trial.

08:02.548 --> 08:03.810
It's not in your best interest.

08:03.883 --> 08:06.750
Never met an opposing counsel
concerned with my interests.

08:06.819 --> 08:10.186
I'm just trying to save you
time and Rule 11 sanctions

08:10.289 --> 08:11.916
for filing a frivolous claim.

08:11.991 --> 08:14.255
The EEOC gave me
go-ahead for this trial,

08:14.327 --> 08:16.488
so it might be a little less
than frivolous.

08:16.562 --> 08:19.122
Be that as it may, a suit like this
would make you

08:19.232 --> 08:21.962
virtually unemployable in this town.

08:22.034 --> 08:24.502
- Not if I win it.
- You won't. What are you gonna do?

08:24.570 --> 08:27.437
Argue Mason Andrews is prejudiced
against African-Americans,

08:27.507 --> 08:30.067
- he's prejudiced against himself?
- Not himself.

08:30.142 --> 08:34.841
Or anyone in his current ZIP Code.
It's black folks like me he can't stand.

08:34.914 --> 08:36.779
Get back to me about a trial date.

08:40.785 --> 08:42.913
Seems pleasant enough.

08:42.989 --> 08:45.958
I can't imagine why he'd have
a hard time finding a job.

08:48.327 --> 08:50.454
What do you mean you don't understand?

08:50.530 --> 08:53.260
Well, if you hadn't
figured it out yet, honey,

08:53.332 --> 08:56.028
you haven't been listening
hard enough.

08:56.102 --> 08:57.660
Is that Taylor's assistant?

08:57.770 --> 09:00.238
Are you gonna do that
every time I finish a call?

09:00.306 --> 09:03.002
- Is it annoying?
- You have no idea.

09:03.075 --> 09:06.010
Find out exactly what Taylor
told Jordan and I'll stop.

09:06.078 --> 09:09.343
Ask her yourself.
She's standing right behind you.

09:12.351 --> 09:14.285
Taylor. What are you doing here?

09:14.353 --> 09:16.617
Lunch with Dad, actually.

09:17.623 --> 09:18.749
How are you, Patti?

09:18.824 --> 09:21.987
Better than I've been
in quite some time.

09:26.098 --> 09:27.065
I can explain.

09:27.166 --> 09:29.999
Nervous about what I'll tell my dad,
dispatched your assistant

09:30.069 --> 09:32.902
- to pump mine for information.
- I guess I don't need to.

09:32.972 --> 09:37.033
I just stopped by to tell you I'm going
to the apartment to pick up my stuff.

09:39.645 --> 09:42.614
I still have my key, so you don't have
to be there to let me in.

09:43.983 --> 09:45.314
Taylor.

09:47.987 --> 09:50.421
For what it's worth, I feel awful.

09:53.125 --> 09:54.649
Unbelievably awful.

09:55.795 --> 09:57.422
And you broke up with me.

09:58.664 --> 10:00.495
So you can imagine how I feel.

10:08.274 --> 10:11.243
- You call at the worst times, Nate.
- It's Coma Guy.

10:11.310 --> 10:14.802
Turns out, and I can't believe
I'm saying this, he does need a lawyer.

10:16.415 --> 10:18.645
Mr. McCann, my associate,
Maggie Dekker.

10:18.718 --> 10:21.346
Pleased to meet you, Coma Guy.
Mr. Coma Guy.

10:21.420 --> 10:23.047
McCann! Mr. McCann.

10:23.122 --> 10:25.955
- Don't mind her. She has Tourette's.
- No, no, it's OK.

10:26.025 --> 10:28.289
Ever since Kimmel,
I get it everywhere I go,

10:28.361 --> 10:32.127
which is ironic since when I went
to sleep I had no idea who Kimmel was.

10:32.231 --> 10:33.858
Must have been hard on your wife.

10:33.933 --> 10:37.767
Yeah, but she coped by leaving me
for my best friend and business partner.

10:37.837 --> 10:40.067
Starting to figure out
why you want to hire a lawyer.

10:40.139 --> 10:41.504
I already have, actually.

10:41.574 --> 10:45.340
He said I should take the ten million
Brooke and Adam are offering and walk.

10:45.444 --> 10:46.968
Wait. Ten million dollars?

10:47.046 --> 10:50.209
After I slipped off the roof,
Adam took our startup public

10:50.316 --> 10:53.479
- and it tripled in value.
- Ten million's a lot of money.

10:53.552 --> 10:56.988
I don't care about money.
I care about my company, what I built,

10:57.056 --> 10:58.421
and I want to get it back.

10:58.491 --> 11:00.516
She got it in the divorce, I'm guessing.

11:00.593 --> 11:02.652
Yeah, it was a pretty sweet deal.

11:02.728 --> 11:05.162
Brooke got my company,
and Adam got my wife.

11:05.231 --> 11:07.597
How are you not
the most bitter man on Earth?

11:07.667 --> 11:11.433
Who says I'm not? Here I am
sitting down with two more lawyers.

11:11.504 --> 11:13.062
One and a half, actually.

11:13.139 --> 11:15.903
Problem is, if the divorce
gave Brooke the company,

11:16.008 --> 11:17.976
then it's gonna be pretty hard to undo.

11:18.077 --> 11:20.011
- But I was in a coma.
- Doesn't matter.

11:20.079 --> 11:23.947
California's a no-fault state.
Brooke wants a divorce, she gets one.

11:24.016 --> 11:26.382
Even if we could contest it,
it'd be hard to do

11:26.485 --> 11:29.010
since the marriage was annulled, so...

11:30.222 --> 11:31.587
Oh, God.

11:32.258 --> 11:34.226
It's a good sign when he does that.

11:34.293 --> 11:38.354
Want to undo the divorce? Your best shot
is to contest the annulment.

11:40.366 --> 11:43.233
- But that means we'd have to...
- Yeah, yeah.

11:43.302 --> 11:45.600
I mean, we'd have to sue the church.

11:56.115 --> 11:58.743
Let me see if I have this right,
Mr. Stone.

11:58.818 --> 12:01.651
Your client wants to regain control
of his company,

12:01.721 --> 12:05.020
so you're contesting the annulment
of his marriage?

12:05.091 --> 12:07.924
It doesn't sound
quite as ridiculous when I explain it.

12:07.993 --> 12:11.360
I wouldn't be so sure. Mr. McCann
and Mr. Stone are asking the court

12:11.430 --> 12:15.526
- to insert itself into a church matter.
- Overturn one. Glad you paid attention.

12:15.601 --> 12:19.059
I'm waiting for a mention
of separation between church and state.

12:19.138 --> 12:22.505
Still around? Hard to tell
with the current administration.

12:22.608 --> 12:26.567
You'll have to do better than comedy to
convince me not to kick this, Mr. Stone.

12:26.679 --> 12:30.012
First Amendment doesn't insulate
the church from a civil suit,

12:30.082 --> 12:33.449
as the recent spate of priestly
misconduct cases demonstrates.

12:33.519 --> 12:36.454
Jake McCann has every right
to contest the annulment.

12:36.522 --> 12:39.685
On what grounds? There have been
no allegations of fraud,

12:39.759 --> 12:42.193
impropriety or any other form
of misconduct.

12:42.261 --> 12:44.889
Depends on how you define
misconduct, Ms. Halston.

12:44.964 --> 12:48.229
Ecclesiastical and California
state law require both parties

12:48.300 --> 12:51.428
be notified of annulment proceedings.
My client wasn't.

12:51.504 --> 12:54.439
- He was in a coma.
- Thank you for reminding me.

12:54.507 --> 12:58.443
Not only was my client not notified,
he was unable to contest it.

12:58.511 --> 13:00.877
Something he had a right to do
under church law.

13:00.980 --> 13:03.073
Even if Mr. McCann was fully conscious,

13:03.149 --> 13:06.516
there's no reason to believe
the church wouldn't have granted it.

13:06.585 --> 13:08.917
Trials are to find out
what did or would've happened.

13:08.988 --> 13:13.084
I'm not gonna let this go to
a full-blown trial on just your say-so.

13:13.159 --> 13:16.822
But I'm not inclined to grant the
defendant's motion to dismiss either.

13:16.896 --> 13:19.729
I want to hear from the priest
who vitiated the marriage.

13:19.799 --> 13:22.097
Evidentiary hearing, 2:00 tomorrow.

13:22.168 --> 13:23.192
Adjourned.

13:24.804 --> 13:29.173
Everything was going great. In two weeks
I blazed through the screening process.

13:29.241 --> 13:32.506
They sat me down with partners
and senior associates.

13:32.578 --> 13:35.638
The only people I didn't meet
were the guys in the mailroom.

13:35.714 --> 13:38.080
But then I had lunch with Mason Andrews.

13:38.150 --> 13:39.674
Now, I was terrified.

13:39.752 --> 13:41.879
This man was my hero, all right?

13:41.954 --> 13:45.481
But the minute I shook his hand,
I knew the feeling wasn't mutual.

13:45.558 --> 13:47.526
And so begins the speculation.

13:47.593 --> 13:49.652
It's not speculation, it's experience.

13:49.728 --> 13:52.162
That look Mason Andrews gave me
when we sat down,

13:52.231 --> 13:54.495
I've seen that look a million times.

13:54.567 --> 13:56.797
That look that says I'm "less than. "

13:56.869 --> 13:59.394
Your Honor, we didn't realize
Mr. Andrews gave him

13:59.471 --> 14:03.498
the "less than" look. Move to skip trial
and enter judgment for the plaintiff.

14:03.576 --> 14:06.943
Mr. Dowd, I know you're eager
to impress your own boss,

14:07.012 --> 14:09.378
but please let Mr. Bennett
finish his account.

14:09.481 --> 14:12.848
He cracked a joke about defending people
from my old neighborhood,

14:12.952 --> 14:14.579
asked me if I wore my hair this way

14:14.653 --> 14:17.520
so my criminal clients
would identify with me more.

14:17.590 --> 14:21.151
Then he excused himself, citing
a court appearance. He didn't have one.

14:21.227 --> 14:22.455
I checked the dockets.

14:22.528 --> 14:26.624
The only reason I didn't get hired was
the same reason he left lunch early.

14:26.699 --> 14:30.658
Black people like me make black people
like Mason Andrews uncomfortable.

14:30.769 --> 14:34.637
What did Mr. Andrews say
his problem was with black attorneys?

14:34.707 --> 14:36.675
He'd never state his prejudice outright.

14:36.775 --> 14:39.209
Did he ever tell you
why you didn't get the job?

14:39.278 --> 14:40.836
- No.
- So you have no evidence

14:40.946 --> 14:44.507
from Mason Andrews' mouth
or any of his friends or colleagues

14:44.617 --> 14:47.643
that he didn't hire you
because of your race?

14:47.720 --> 14:49.585
Asked and answered, counsel.

14:49.655 --> 14:54.115
Why didn't you apply for a job
with my firm, Mr. Bennett?

14:54.193 --> 14:57.492
We recruit from the same applicant pool
as Andrews Worth.

14:57.563 --> 14:59.326
I just didn't think I'd be a good fit.

14:59.431 --> 15:03.595
So you made a choice
about what firm fit you best,

15:03.702 --> 15:07.934
and yet you're suing Mason Andrews' firm
for making the same kind of decision?

15:08.007 --> 15:10.771
- It's not the same kind of decision.
- I beg to differ.

15:11.911 --> 15:14.641
Perhaps I should sue you
for discrimination.

15:16.949 --> 15:19.247
I did not go through 12 years
of Catholic school

15:19.318 --> 15:21.582
and three years of law school
to sue God.

15:21.654 --> 15:24.680
We're not suing God,
we're suing the Catholic Church.

15:24.757 --> 15:26.725
Like that distinction's gonna matter

15:26.792 --> 15:30.228
when my skin is roasting in the
non-consuming fire of all eternity.

15:30.296 --> 15:32.264
As long as we're not dramatic about it.

15:32.331 --> 15:34.299
I'm serious, Eli.

15:34.400 --> 15:36.891
Don't let this rough-edged
demeanor fool you.

15:36.969 --> 15:39.529
Beneath this tough exterior
beats the heart of a girl

15:39.605 --> 15:42.574
who still believes in God, prayer,
and marrying for life.

15:42.675 --> 15:47.578
Eli, Mr. And Mrs. Rivera are here
without an appointment.

15:47.646 --> 15:50.479
Or an attorney, apparently.
Where's your attorney?

15:50.549 --> 15:54.918
Patti, is it too much to ask to insulate
me from illegal ex parte conversations?

15:55.020 --> 15:58.080
This isn't some legal technicality
to us, Mr. Stone.

15:58.157 --> 16:01.126
This lawsuit is playing havoc
with our lives.

16:01.226 --> 16:03.285
Also seems inconvenient for Jake.

16:03.362 --> 16:05.626
- Jake is my best friend.
- Was.

16:05.698 --> 16:09.156
You won't find two people on Earth
who care about him more than we do.

16:09.234 --> 16:10.667
That kind of sucks for Jake.

16:12.171 --> 16:16.130
What were we supposed to do?
It had been three years.

16:16.241 --> 16:19.301
Every doctor, all of them,
said he was never gonna wake up.

16:19.378 --> 16:21.812
You can't blame us
for not seeing the future.

16:21.880 --> 16:24.405
You can't blame Jake
for wanting his life back.

16:24.483 --> 16:28.419
His life? He doesn't want his life back,
Mr. Stone. He wants ours.

16:28.487 --> 16:31.047
Jake disagrees,
which is why we're in litigation.

16:31.123 --> 16:34.615
Litigation is why we can't continue
this conversation. Please go.

16:41.934 --> 16:44.494
Patti, you're supposed to be
my gatekeeper.

16:44.570 --> 16:48.529
You're suing God and you're telling me
what I'm not supposed to do?

16:48.607 --> 16:52.270
- I'm not suing God!
- Speaking of the man upstairs,

16:52.344 --> 16:56.371
Jordan would like you in his office.
Pronto.

17:02.688 --> 17:05.122
Suing God now, are we, Eli?

17:05.190 --> 17:08.751
Not the Almighty, sir.
Just his church.

17:08.861 --> 17:11.954
Actually, not an entire church,
just a priest.

17:12.031 --> 17:14.499
People do that all the time these days.

17:14.566 --> 17:17.057
Just like buying a hybrid.

17:17.136 --> 17:19.434
That's not why I summoned you.
Please sit down.

17:25.176 --> 17:28.112
Taylor told me about you
breaking off the engagement.

17:29.915 --> 17:32.679
I'm not angry with you,
if you're concerned.

17:32.785 --> 17:37.085
I'm not concerned.
Panicked would be more accurate.

17:37.156 --> 17:40.683
I hope I didn't influence
your decision in any way.

17:41.593 --> 17:45.359
- Is that what she?
- She wasn't forthcoming with specifics.

17:50.936 --> 17:52.267
She's amazing, sir.

17:52.337 --> 17:56.501
And I'm sorry it didn't work out. But...

17:57.743 --> 18:01.110
...the reason is... personal.

18:04.483 --> 18:07.919
- If there's nothing else?
- No. You can go.

18:26.705 --> 18:28.036
Jake?

18:39.184 --> 18:40.549
Oh, not again.

19:39.011 --> 19:42.037
I graduated number one
in my Harvard Law School class.

19:42.114 --> 19:44.048
After my first interview,

19:44.116 --> 19:46.641
I overheard the two men
I'd just been talking with

19:46.718 --> 19:49.687
joking that "letting a Negro
into Harvard

19:49.788 --> 19:52.222
was like teaching a donkey
to ice skate. "

19:54.259 --> 19:56.727
That's not being hired
because of your race.

19:56.795 --> 19:59.161
- Is that why you started your own firm?
- Yes.

19:59.231 --> 20:03.167
And I'm proud to say my hiring practices
are the most diverse in the country.

20:03.235 --> 20:07.069
And these would be the associates
you've hired?

20:07.139 --> 20:09.835
Well, some of them.
The others had better things to do

20:09.908 --> 20:11.876
than to help defend me this afternoon.

20:13.812 --> 20:15.336
Nothing further.

20:15.414 --> 20:18.042
How well do you recall our lunch
that day, Mr. Andrews?

20:18.116 --> 20:20.482
- Well enough.
- You recall asking about my hair?

20:20.586 --> 20:22.816
Yes, because it seemed unkempt.

20:22.888 --> 20:25.857
You ever wear a 'fro? Dreads?
How about some cornrows?

20:25.924 --> 20:29.155
Objection. I doubt Mr. Andrews'
hair choice has relevance...

20:29.228 --> 20:32.789
It has as much relevance as my hair
had to do with me not getting the job.

20:32.898 --> 20:35.264
- Overruled.
- Do you believe you had to change

20:35.334 --> 20:37.894
your appearance to fit into
the corporate world you now dominate?

20:38.003 --> 20:40.870
Of course, but that's not racism.
That's common sense.

20:40.939 --> 20:43.407
But you don't believe
I made those changes?

20:43.475 --> 20:47.434
As a business owner, I have a right
to make decisions about who I hire.

20:47.512 --> 20:51.175
- That right is protected by law.
- Provided you don't discriminate.

20:51.250 --> 20:54.117
Could the brother in the back
stand up again, please?

20:56.722 --> 21:00.055
What's the difference
between this gentleman...

21:01.059 --> 21:03.960
...and me?
- He's not suing me, for one thing.

21:05.864 --> 21:09.027
That's funny. Any other differences?

21:09.134 --> 21:12.592
Well, his experience and his rÃ©sumÃ©
were a better fit for my firm,

21:12.671 --> 21:13.831
if that's what you mean.

21:13.939 --> 21:18.103
If I subpoena his transcripts, am I
likely to find he was also salutatorian

21:18.176 --> 21:20.542
at one of the leading law schools,
your alma mater?

21:20.646 --> 21:22.807
There's no doubt
you're an intelligent man

21:22.914 --> 21:25.576
or you wouldn't have made
the lunch in the first place.

21:25.651 --> 21:31.146
So there's no other differences
between this black man... and me?

21:35.627 --> 21:38.323
Are you blind?
Which one of us is darker?

21:38.397 --> 21:40.957
- Objection! Badgering the witness.
- The way we dress?

21:41.066 --> 21:43.091
Mr. Bennett, settle down or I will...

21:43.168 --> 21:45.500
The difference is
that he doesn't use his race

21:45.570 --> 21:48.130
as an excuse for shiftless behavior.

21:49.508 --> 21:52.170
- Would you care to elaborate on that?
- Happily.

21:52.244 --> 21:56.078
You showed up at that lunch with an
attitude I've seen in other black men.

21:56.148 --> 22:01.176
Black men who use their race as an
excuse for a certain kind of arrogance,

22:01.253 --> 22:04.620
as if the rules that apply
to the rest of us don't apply to them.

22:04.690 --> 22:08.057
If I am prejudiced against anything,
it's that kind of arrogance!

22:08.160 --> 22:11.652
So the day we had lunch,
you weren't eating with a Harvard grad

22:11.730 --> 22:13.391
with sterling recommendations

22:13.465 --> 22:16.628
and a three-for-five record
in the public defender's office.

22:16.735 --> 22:20.865
You were eating with
a young, arrogant black punk

22:20.939 --> 22:22.998
with an unkempt 'fro.

22:25.944 --> 22:27.377
No wonder you left early.

22:29.081 --> 22:31.447
Father Hewson,
could you tell the court,

22:31.516 --> 22:34.212
what is a marriage
in the eyes of the Catholic Church?

22:34.286 --> 22:37.949
It's a holy sacrament, a lifetime bond
between two people before God.

22:38.023 --> 22:41.652
Yet here we are in the presence
of two people still living

22:41.727 --> 22:44.389
yet no longer bound
in the eyes of the church?

22:44.463 --> 22:46.363
That's what an annulment does.

22:46.431 --> 22:49.958
So this lifetime bond, you can just,
in a split second, erase it?

22:50.035 --> 22:52.595
- The process is not that simple.
- I'm sure it's not.

22:52.704 --> 22:54.865
For example,
I'm sure that some spouses

22:54.940 --> 22:57.636
oppose the annulment
requested by the other spouse.

22:57.709 --> 22:59.336
Yes, some do.

22:59.411 --> 23:02.244
But Jake McCann didn't deserve
that opportunity?

23:02.314 --> 23:04.874
I consulted with Mr. McCann's doctors.

23:04.983 --> 23:07.349
Every one of them told me
he wouldn't wake up.

23:07.419 --> 23:11.651
So I guess what you're saying is
Jake's recovery was a miracle?

23:11.723 --> 23:13.486
Yes, it was.

23:13.592 --> 23:16.060
I guess it's a shame
that a priest of all people

23:16.128 --> 23:18.153
wasn't holding out for such a miracle.

23:18.230 --> 23:22.394
Do you think God's decision to spare
Mr. McCann's life was a sign

23:22.467 --> 23:27.336
that He wanted him to fulfill his
eternal marital obligations to his wife?

23:27.406 --> 23:30.967
I don't presume to question God's plan
for any of His faithful.

23:31.076 --> 23:34.443
No. I guess you just erase
the vows they make.

23:41.686 --> 23:43.415
Why are you doing this?

23:47.325 --> 23:50.192
I waited for you to wake up, Jake.

23:50.262 --> 23:54.221
Three years I waited. Two of them
I barely left the hospital.

23:54.299 --> 23:56.790
In sickness and in health.
Those were the vows.

23:56.868 --> 23:59.564
That's easy for you to say.
You were asleep.

23:59.638 --> 24:02.106
I was alone. I needed someone.

24:02.174 --> 24:05.541
Now? Do you still need him now?

24:05.610 --> 24:07.976
- Jake, I...
- I don't believe you love him

24:08.046 --> 24:09.411
the way that you loved me.

24:11.049 --> 24:12.482
I'm so sorry.

24:24.563 --> 24:26.895
What were you thinking
at that lunch, Mason?

24:26.965 --> 24:28.728
What was I thinking? He rolls in,

24:28.800 --> 24:32.361
in a cheap five-button zoot suit
with bad shoes.

24:32.471 --> 24:35.406
We're sitting at the best table
in the Derby Room,

24:35.474 --> 24:38.238
he greets the waiter
like they're homeys on the street.

24:38.343 --> 24:41.244
Can you see putting him in a room
with a corporate client?

24:41.313 --> 24:43.747
Only if they wanted to win their case.

24:43.815 --> 24:46.750
I made sacrifices
so he could go to Harvard,

24:46.818 --> 24:50.185
so he'd be considered for a corner
office instead of a janitorial job.

24:50.255 --> 24:53.554
But the price is you've got to act,
look and dress a certain way.

24:53.625 --> 24:56.458
I'm sorry if that interferes
with his keeping it real,

24:56.528 --> 24:59.088
but it's not the way we run things
at Andrews Worth.

24:59.197 --> 25:03.293
It's not the way you run things, unless
you changed your hiring practices.

25:07.572 --> 25:11.030
I'll win this case, Mason, because
that's what I do for my clients.

25:12.110 --> 25:15.671
But if you want to settle,
I'll help you work out a number.

25:15.780 --> 25:19.944
Just make sure it's not a guilty
conscience telling you to make a deal.

25:20.051 --> 25:23.179
My conscience is clear.

25:23.255 --> 25:25.917
- We'll go to verdict.
- I'll see you in the morning.

25:27.993 --> 25:29.153
We're winning?

25:29.261 --> 25:32.628
Yes. The judge will probably
vacate the annulment,

25:32.731 --> 25:35.700
but... but I don't think we're winning.

25:36.735 --> 25:39.499
What you're trying to win
you can't get from a lawsuit.

25:39.604 --> 25:42.334
I thought you said I could get
my company back this way.

25:42.407 --> 25:44.875
Your company, yes, but not Brooke.

25:45.810 --> 25:47.971
Well, I don't care about Brooke anymore.

25:48.613 --> 25:50.581
I don't think that's true.

25:52.117 --> 25:54.142
She loves him, Jake.

25:54.219 --> 25:56.517
And she's happy with him.

25:57.556 --> 25:59.524
You want her to be happy, right?

26:01.593 --> 26:06.360
Look, I know a little something
about living on borrowed time.

26:06.431 --> 26:08.797
You've already lost five years
of your life.

26:08.900 --> 26:11.664
Don't spend the rest of it
in the courtroom.

26:15.373 --> 26:17.341
It's like I lost her twice, you know?

26:19.244 --> 26:23.203
Once when I went into the coma
and again when I woke up.

26:24.583 --> 26:26.448
I understand why you're angry.

26:27.786 --> 26:30.812
I just don't think Brooke's
the one to be angry at.

26:35.727 --> 26:36.853
OK.

26:38.597 --> 26:39.655
Settle it.

26:49.374 --> 26:53.811
So, what was that about?
The "borrowed time" thing.

26:53.878 --> 26:55.539
Nothing.

26:55.614 --> 26:57.172
Nothing?

26:58.550 --> 27:00.211
Maggie, everything's fine.

27:13.832 --> 27:15.800
Thought you weren't coming.

27:16.368 --> 27:19.132
Thought you decided it'd be better
if I did this alone.

27:20.572 --> 27:23.598
I know you didn't tell your dad
about the aneurysm.

27:25.844 --> 27:27.106
Thank you.

27:28.847 --> 27:30.178
I love you, Eli.

27:30.248 --> 27:32.216
You haven't figured that out?

27:32.984 --> 27:34.349
I meant it when I said yes.

27:35.787 --> 27:37.220
And I meant it when I asked.

27:38.790 --> 27:40.553
It seems like a long time ago.

27:43.595 --> 27:44.960
Three months.

27:47.666 --> 27:51.432
I... tried to return this.

27:51.503 --> 27:53.471
They wouldn't take it back.

27:53.571 --> 27:54.936
No receipt.

27:56.007 --> 27:58.373
Seems like diamonds really are forever.

28:00.812 --> 28:03.781
Just like you to make a major purchase
without getting a receipt.

28:03.848 --> 28:06.009
I didn't think I'd be taking it back.

28:08.086 --> 28:09.451
It's funny.

28:10.689 --> 28:12.452
I thought it might be a sign.

28:15.960 --> 28:17.518
What does that mean?

28:18.763 --> 28:21.732
You were so sure breaking things off
was the right thing to do.

28:23.768 --> 28:26.532
The guy I'm representing
was in a coma for five years.

28:27.772 --> 28:29.330
We're talking about work now?

28:29.407 --> 28:32.376
They told his wife
he would never wake up,

28:32.477 --> 28:34.638
so she left him.

28:34.713 --> 28:36.442
It's hard to blame her.

28:37.916 --> 28:39.213
It was a freak accident.

28:39.284 --> 28:42.253
When they got married she didn't know
he would go into a coma

28:42.320 --> 28:44.686
and their lives would be ripped apart.

28:48.326 --> 28:50.692
You know what could happen to me...

28:51.963 --> 28:54.397
...and you still want to stay.

28:56.401 --> 28:58.733
That's what I've been
telling you all along.

29:00.605 --> 29:02.573
I ruined our engagement party.

29:02.640 --> 29:04.574
Your father hates me.

29:08.079 --> 29:12.243
Why would you think either of those two
things would matter to me more than you?

29:23.027 --> 29:24.551
What does this mean?

29:25.630 --> 29:26.961
I don't know.

29:41.846 --> 29:43.313
Taylor?

29:54.526 --> 29:57.154
Guess we should probably talk
about last night.

29:59.531 --> 30:00.793
Taylor?

30:09.507 --> 30:12.635
Help me. Help me.

30:14.612 --> 30:18.776
I am. I'm gonna settle the case
first thing this morning, I promise.

30:20.351 --> 30:22.649
This... There's no need
to be on my floor.

30:24.022 --> 30:26.047
Help me, Stone.

30:26.758 --> 30:30.694
- There's something wrong with him.
- He just woke up from a five-year coma.

30:30.762 --> 30:33.196
- He's a freak of nature.
- No, medically wrong.

30:33.264 --> 30:36.700
- Check him out again.
- And what test would you recommend?

30:36.768 --> 30:39.703
- I was thinking an MRI.
- I was kidding.

30:39.771 --> 30:42.672
He's had like 50 MRI's in as many days,

30:42.740 --> 30:46.267
not to mention constant monitoring
and more meds than I care to count.

30:46.344 --> 30:48.972
If there was something to catch
we'd have caught it.

30:49.047 --> 30:51.311
The past few days I've been
very close to him.

30:51.382 --> 30:54.215
- He's practically followed me home.
- Yeah, of course.

30:54.285 --> 30:55.752
Sympathetic transference.

30:55.820 --> 30:59.517
You have a neurological condition,
he suffered a neurological trauma.

30:59.591 --> 31:03.527
That's not it. I'm telling you, I know
there's something wrong, Nate.

31:03.595 --> 31:04.892
How, Eli?

31:06.464 --> 31:07.829
How do you know that?

31:09.667 --> 31:11.635
I just do.

31:16.241 --> 31:19.005
It's bad enough you convinced him
to go to court.

31:19.077 --> 31:21.011
Now you want to subject him
to more tests,

31:21.079 --> 31:26.016
which will cost him time
and thousands of dollars on a hunch?

31:26.084 --> 31:27.449
I won't do it, Eli.

31:30.288 --> 31:32.756
I'll talk to you later.
I've got patients.

31:39.430 --> 31:41.193
My first week as a public defender

31:41.299 --> 31:44.564
I went in for an arraignment,
and while I was waiting

31:44.636 --> 31:46.160
an ADA approached me

31:46.237 --> 31:50.401
and told me the gallery I was sitting in
was reserved for attorneys,

31:50.508 --> 31:52.066
not defendants.

31:52.176 --> 31:55.907
Yeah. When I told him
I was a lawyer he got this...

31:56.648 --> 31:59.310
This look on his face.

32:00.718 --> 32:03.881
It was the same look Mason Andrews
gave me when I first met him.

32:03.988 --> 32:06.718
And the ADA was white,
Mason Andrews is black,

32:06.791 --> 32:11.057
but the attitudes and assumptions...
exactly the same.

32:11.896 --> 32:15.764
I'm sure many of you are thinking
black-on-black prejudice is ridiculous.

32:15.833 --> 32:17.460
It's impossible.

32:17.535 --> 32:20.299
Wasn't that long ago
they'd have said the same thing

32:20.405 --> 32:23.169
about interracial marriage
or desegregation.

32:23.274 --> 32:26.243
Maybe the most telling measure
of the strides we've made

32:26.344 --> 32:28.403
is today a black man can rise to a level

32:28.479 --> 32:32.643
where he can actually practice
discrimination.

32:34.118 --> 32:36.416
Even if it is against another black man.

32:45.163 --> 32:49.122
Mason Andrews lived through
the challenges of segregation

32:49.233 --> 32:51.565
on his way to Harvard Law School.

32:52.637 --> 32:55.970
He became a pillar in the local
African-American community

32:56.040 --> 32:58.565
and a famed advocate for civil rights.

32:58.643 --> 33:01.612
Does that sound like a racist
of any stripe?

33:03.715 --> 33:06.206
There's a difference,
ladies and gentlemen,

33:06.284 --> 33:09.447
between discrimination and discretion.

33:09.554 --> 33:12.489
All Mason Andrews did
was exercise his legal right

33:12.557 --> 33:17.017
not to hire someone he didn't care for.

33:18.262 --> 33:19.923
Now, as we all witnessed,

33:19.998 --> 33:22.626
Mason Andrews' dislike of Mr. Bennett

33:22.700 --> 33:25.669
is steeped in their shared
racial heritage.

33:25.770 --> 33:28.466
I would even go so far as to admit

33:28.539 --> 33:33.499
Mr. Andrews harbors some resentment
of young black men like Keith Bennett,

33:33.611 --> 33:36.478
but resentment isn't racism.

33:38.950 --> 33:41.612
And if you have any doubt of that,

33:41.686 --> 33:45.554
ask yourselves
if these two men were white...

33:47.091 --> 33:48.649
...would we even be here today?

33:50.161 --> 33:52.129
Hey. Where's Adam?

33:52.897 --> 33:54.228
He didn't want to be here.

33:55.700 --> 33:57.668
Jake's agreed to the settlement terms.

33:57.769 --> 34:00.329
You and Adam will retain control
of the company.

34:00.405 --> 34:03.897
I got
the execution drafts right here.

34:05.643 --> 34:06.735
All signed.

34:06.811 --> 34:08.438
I guess...

34:09.179 --> 34:11.148
I guess we're done. Thanks.

34:11.248 --> 34:12.909
- You're welcome.
- Thank you.

34:18.121 --> 34:19.851
For what it's worth...

34:20.591 --> 34:22.956
...I'm glad you and Adam
found each other.

34:25.929 --> 34:28.262
I hope you have a good life.

34:28.331 --> 34:29.958
I want you to.

34:31.601 --> 34:32.933
Jake.

34:40.610 --> 34:42.579
That's the man I fell in love with.

34:43.880 --> 34:46.349
- Oh, my God!
- What happened?

34:46.417 --> 34:48.179
Call 911!

34:50.788 --> 34:52.255
Hurry!

34:55.159 --> 34:56.456
Help me, Stone.

34:59.964 --> 35:01.522
Are you all right?

35:04.102 --> 35:06.366
What was it? I thought he was OK.

35:06.437 --> 35:08.166
He was. He...

35:11.976 --> 35:15.434
He had an acute MI. Heart attack.

35:20.118 --> 35:23.178
His heart could have been
compromised by the coma.

35:24.922 --> 35:28.085
But there weren't any signs.

35:28.993 --> 35:30.722
This...

35:31.662 --> 35:34.631
It's like it just... stopped.

35:40.271 --> 35:42.000
Are you OK?

35:44.408 --> 35:47.571
And like you said,
there weren't any signs.

35:49.147 --> 35:51.081
- There's nothing you...
- Just...

35:53.551 --> 35:54.882
...go.

35:57.288 --> 35:58.653
All right?

36:13.738 --> 36:15.365
Has the jury reached a verdict?

36:15.439 --> 36:16.804
We have, Your Honor.

36:18.576 --> 36:23.206
In the matter of Bennett v. Andrews,
we the jury find no basis

36:23.281 --> 36:26.444
for the charge of racial discrimination
under the guidelines

36:26.517 --> 36:29.077
of the Equal Employment
Opportunity Commission.

36:29.153 --> 36:31.314
We find for the defendant,
Mason Andrews.

36:31.389 --> 36:34.483
As no counter-claim was brought
by the defendant,

36:34.559 --> 36:37.585
there will be no damages
assessed in this case.

36:37.662 --> 36:38.993
Court is now adjourned.

36:39.797 --> 36:41.765
- Thank you.
- Congratulations.

36:44.202 --> 36:46.727
Mason, congratulations.

36:46.804 --> 36:50.570
Thank you. I guess you were right,
not allowing me to settle.

36:52.877 --> 36:54.504
Lunch at the club next week?

36:54.579 --> 36:56.103
I'll call you.

36:57.949 --> 36:59.473
Mr. Bennett.

37:01.419 --> 37:02.909
Congratulations on the win.

37:03.688 --> 37:06.623
- You didn't have the law.
- No, but I had the facts.

37:06.691 --> 37:08.852
Some facts, but not proof.

37:08.960 --> 37:12.726
I was wrong before when I said
no firm would hire you.

37:15.233 --> 37:17.963
What, you looking for more
black lawyers over there?

37:18.035 --> 37:21.061
No. I need more great lawyers.

37:29.880 --> 37:32.041
I can't believe
you talked to Eli.

37:32.116 --> 37:34.277
You promised you wouldn't intervene
in my relationship.

37:34.352 --> 37:37.185
He works for me.
I promised not to intervene.

37:37.255 --> 37:39.723
I didn't promise not to speak to him.

37:40.524 --> 37:43.618
- I'm a lawyer. I look for loopholes.
- But you can't...

37:43.694 --> 37:45.958
Our relationship is still...

37:46.797 --> 37:50.893
It's still complicated, OK? You can't
go around bullying him to stay with me.

37:50.968 --> 37:54.199
I have not done and have no plans
to do any such thing,

37:54.272 --> 37:57.139
- nor do I feel the need to.
- What does that mean?

38:00.077 --> 38:03.638
I think Eli is more than
a little conflicted about his decision,

38:03.748 --> 38:06.046
- as any sane man would be.
- I think so too.

38:06.117 --> 38:10.611
But, Taylor, it's equally obvious
that he's in a state of confusion.

38:12.857 --> 38:14.757
I don't want to see you get hurt.

38:18.562 --> 38:21.292
You taught me to fight
for the things I care about.

38:21.365 --> 38:22.992
I care about Eli.

38:24.335 --> 38:26.303
And I know what I want to do.

38:41.452 --> 38:45.013
Are you Eli Stone, asshat at law?

38:47.992 --> 38:49.857
How much did you drink?

38:49.927 --> 38:51.986
I'm... I'm not sure,

38:52.063 --> 38:55.157
but when the bartender asks you
for your keys back

38:55.232 --> 38:57.325
you gotta figure that's not a good sign.

38:57.401 --> 38:59.869
Or a good sign, depending...

38:59.937 --> 39:01.700
I cabbed it over.

39:03.541 --> 39:04.838
You're gonna be OK?

39:05.943 --> 39:09.902
It's not like Jake was
the first patient I ever lost,

39:10.014 --> 39:12.380
although that doesn't make it
suck any less.

39:13.484 --> 39:15.918
There's nothing you could've done, Nate.

39:16.821 --> 39:19.756
- You couldn't have seen it coming.
- I know I couldn't.

39:19.824 --> 39:21.553
So how did you?

39:22.793 --> 39:26.160
The reason I came to you and I asked you
to do something about Jake

39:26.263 --> 39:30.097
was... I knew he was gonna die.

39:31.302 --> 39:33.361
You mean you saw the future?

39:34.438 --> 39:36.906
You sure you're not the one
who's been drinking?

39:38.109 --> 39:40.339
You know I've been seeing things lately.

39:41.579 --> 39:45.345
Well, I'm starting to think they're not
just 'cause of my aneurysm.

39:48.319 --> 39:50.879
I think they may have
some greater significance.

39:51.922 --> 39:56.882
Eli, look, it is only natural
that you would want to place your...

39:56.994 --> 39:58.689
No, Nathan.

40:00.264 --> 40:02.129
Something's happening to me.

40:03.401 --> 40:06.370
And it's how I knew Jake needed
medical help.

40:06.470 --> 40:09.030
He started singing Good Lovin'.

40:09.140 --> 40:12.701
You know those lyrics?
I was feelin' so bad

40:12.777 --> 40:15.712
I asked my family doctor
just what I had

40:15.780 --> 40:19.079
That's you, why every time I saw him
he was dressed as a patient.

40:21.552 --> 40:24.885
I was supposed to get you
to help him.

40:26.090 --> 40:28.558
- Oh, my God.
- I know you don't believe me.

40:28.626 --> 40:31.390
I sure wouldn't, but...

40:34.231 --> 40:35.994
I had to tell someone else.

40:36.100 --> 40:37.761
Someone close to me.

40:39.303 --> 40:40.770
Eli...

40:41.839 --> 40:46.173
...when Dad died,
I put a cassette in his coffin.

40:48.179 --> 40:51.546
It was of a song that he kept singing...

40:53.717 --> 40:57.016
...when he took me upstate
for the fishing trip.

40:59.723 --> 41:02.886
He just kept singing it over and over.

41:02.993 --> 41:07.657
I hate fishing and he was
the worst singer in the world.

41:10.267 --> 41:11.632
But...

41:12.336 --> 41:14.804
That trip was...

41:17.274 --> 41:20.835
It was really special to me.

41:22.880 --> 41:26.008
The song on the cassette
was Good Lovin' by The Rascals.

41:30.087 --> 41:32.021
Nobody else knew about that.

41:36.360 --> 41:38.089
It's crazy, huh?

41:39.430 --> 41:42.763
Yes. Just a little bit. I need a drink.

41:42.833 --> 41:44.494
More to drink.

41:44.568 --> 41:48.834
Well, I'm out of bourbon.
You had enough, dude.

41:50.774 --> 41:55.711
But, uh, I do have
some microwave popcorn.

41:55.779 --> 41:57.303
Ah, OK.

42:00.851 --> 42:02.318
You know what?

42:03.521 --> 42:06.490
There's a rerun of Working Girl
on the WE Channel.

42:09.860 --> 42:12.420
Dude, you have got to get back
together with Taylor.
