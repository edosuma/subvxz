he was a regular
on online chat rooms

30:10.009 --> 30:11.077
of militias and
anti-government

30:11.110 --> 30:12.144
resistance groups.

30:12.611 --> 30:15.214
He's also believed
to have quit the NRA

30:15.247 --> 30:17.616
viewing its stance
on gun rights as too weak.

30:17.649 --> 30:18.584
Unbelievable.

30:18.617 --> 30:19.585
FEMALE NEWS ANCHOR:
It's unknown whether Kelly

30:19.618 --> 30:22.254
may have been suffering
from PTSD at this time.

30:22.288 --> 30:23.856
It doesn't appear that
the suspect

30:23.890 --> 30:24.891
-has any...
-(CLOSES VIDEO)

30:26.558 --> 30:27.994
Look at this.

30:28.027 --> 30:30.930
He dropped this on his
way back to the house.

30:30.963 --> 30:32.331
There's a
prescription in here.

30:32.932 --> 30:34.266
Benjamin Frederick Olson.

30:37.904 --> 30:39.205
Let's see here.

30:46.979 --> 30:48.314
Benjamin Olson.

30:48.347 --> 30:50.416
He worked for the Office
of Budget Management.

30:50.449 --> 30:52.351
Federal accountants.

30:52.384 --> 30:54.186
Looks like they audited
federal agencies.

30:58.157 --> 30:59.591
And guess where
their offices are?

31:00.326 --> 31:01.427
The Hoover Building.

31:02.061 --> 31:03.862
They were targeting
federal accountants.

31:08.634 --> 31:11.037
(SIGHS) So, Olson doesn't
show up for work one day...

31:11.070 --> 31:12.304
So they go visit
him at his house.

31:12.338 --> 31:15.074
-And he's not home.
-So then it all goes to shit.

31:16.142 --> 31:19.011
Why is the Ombello Group
targeting federal accountants?

31:19.045 --> 31:21.080
Maybe they uncovered
something about Ombello.

31:21.113 --> 31:22.614
Something they didn't
want made public.

31:26.418 --> 31:27.486
I need another drink.

31:31.223 --> 31:33.960
Earlier today,
I got a name.

31:35.161 --> 31:38.030
Officer Cody Soto. Works out
of the Southern Division.

31:38.564 --> 31:39.932
I haven't heard of him.

31:39.966 --> 31:42.201
Well, he's connected
to the bombing somehow.

31:42.234 --> 31:43.635
Okay, well, I'll call Regan.

31:43.669 --> 31:45.337
I can see what
she can find on him.

31:45.371 --> 31:47.173
-Nah, nah, nah.
-Why?

31:48.274 --> 31:50.009
Regan sold me out, Clea.

31:51.177 --> 31:53.145
I called her earlier
about Soto.

31:53.179 --> 31:54.613
We arranged a meeting,

31:54.646 --> 31:57.083
I showed up and...
(CHUCKLES)

31:57.116 --> 31:59.118
There were feds crawling
all over the fucking place.

32:01.253 --> 32:03.255
I'm sorry.

32:03.289 --> 32:04.423
You guys were
close, right?

32:05.391 --> 32:06.525
I mean, I thought so.

32:09.728 --> 32:11.530
All right, well,
I'll call my partner,

32:11.563 --> 32:12.999
see what she
can get on Soto.

32:13.432 --> 32:14.533
You really trust her?

32:15.634 --> 32:17.269
More than Regan, apparently.

32:17.636 --> 32:18.637
Hmm.

32:21.173 --> 32:23.409
-Hey, Doyle, it's me.
-BETHANY: What do you need?

32:33.219 --> 32:35.587
Jesus. What happened?

32:35.787 --> 32:37.123
You know, when
this is all over,

32:37.156 --> 32:38.657
you and me,
we're gonna go to Cooley's,

32:38.690 --> 32:40.726
we're gonna drink
the place dry and we'll talk.

32:40.759 --> 32:42.961
-All right.
-What'd you get on Soto?

32:43.629 --> 32:45.264
Uh, his file's on here.

32:45.297 --> 32:47.266
He was accused by IA
of planting evidence

32:47.299 --> 32:48.400
a few years back.

32:48.434 --> 32:50.002
He worked at
Bayview Station at the time,

32:50.036 --> 32:51.037
but guess who with?

32:52.238 --> 32:53.405
Captain Sleader.

32:54.306 --> 32:55.374
Right first time.

32:56.575 --> 32:57.709
Fuck!

32:58.244 --> 32:59.278
That's all I've got right now.

32:59.311 --> 33:00.579
But I got a friend
who works in IA.

33:00.612 --> 33:02.314
-I'll see what he can dig up.
-Okay.

33:02.614 --> 33:03.649
Brought you
some clean clothes.

33:03.682 --> 33:04.616
Thank you.

33:04.650 --> 33:06.752
Your laptop and the case file
like you asked.

33:06.785 --> 33:09.055
Oh, and these came in.

33:10.556 --> 33:13.125
Stills from the
security camera,

33:13.159 --> 33:14.393
the night Jameson
was killed.

33:14.426 --> 33:16.495
You're a fucking
rock star.

33:17.629 --> 33:19.065
So I've been told.

33:44.490 --> 33:46.292
MALE NEWS ANCHOR: And today
a more complete picture

33:46.325 --> 33:47.593
is emerging of the suspect,

33:47.626 --> 33:50.028
disgruntled war veteran
Ethan Kelly.

33:50.329 --> 33:51.563
Kelly started
a security business

33:51.597 --> 33:53.599
in San Francisco
a couple years back

33:53.632 --> 33:54.800
with some ex-army buddies,

33:54.833 --> 33:57.303
one of whom died
from a fentanyl overdose,

33:57.336 --> 33:58.837
another committed suicide,

33:58.870 --> 34:02.574
and a third, Ray Williams,
is missing, presumed dead.

34:10.682 --> 34:12.218
(KNOCK ON DOOR)

34:17.756 --> 34:19.525
-Yeah.
-CLEA: It's me.

34:22.694 --> 34:23.795
Hey.

34:24.396 --> 34:25.697
-You doing okay?
-Yeah.

34:29.401 --> 34:30.869
Soto's file.

34:30.902 --> 34:32.271
Thanks.

34:39.311 --> 34:42.381
Soto was reported to IA
for planting evidence,

34:42.414 --> 34:43.782
but that's all
we have on him so far.

34:43.815 --> 34:45.784
I'm still having
my partner look into it.

34:45.817 --> 34:47.419
Yeah, what do you got there?

34:47.453 --> 34:49.755
These are stills
from the security camera

34:49.788 --> 34:52.524
at the restaurant the night
Daniel Jameson was killed.

34:52.558 --> 34:54.460
So we know
Daniel Jameson was there.

34:54.493 --> 34:57.863
Turns out that surgeon, Neil
Everett, he was also there.

34:57.896 --> 35:00.432
I'm just trying
to connect the two.

35:00.466 --> 35:01.867
See if we may...

35:08.207 --> 35:09.341
You found something?

35:11.377 --> 35:12.544
CLEA: So, that's Jameson.
ETHAN: Yeah.

35:12.578 --> 35:15.281
-Everett.
-ETHAN: Who's the third man?

35:15.547 --> 35:17.316
CLEA: I don't know.
It might be nobody.

35:18.684 --> 35:19.885
Whoa, hold on a second.

35:21.287 --> 35:22.321
Everett's handing
him something.

35:22.354 --> 35:23.355
Looks like an envelope.

35:25.191 --> 35:26.592
You know what? Maybe we
go talk to Everett,

35:26.625 --> 35:28.194
find out who this guy is.

35:28.227 --> 35:30.562
-Okay. What about Soto?
-Mmm. Soto can wait.

35:30.896 --> 35:33.499
Wasn't Jameson
a founding partner of Ombello?

35:33.532 --> 35:34.533
Yeah.

35:36.402 --> 35:38.370
It's the head of the snake.

35:38.404 --> 35:39.771
Let's go find out
who his drinking buddy is.

35:45.611 --> 35:46.645
Christ, Terry.

35:47.879 --> 35:48.947
You look rough.

35:48.980 --> 35:50.782
(CHUCKLES)

35:50.816 --> 35:52.584
-Did you go home last night?
-No.

35:53.552 --> 35:54.620
You need to get
some sleep.

35:54.853 --> 35:56.888
What I need
is some good news.

35:57.556 --> 35:58.724
I wish I had some.

35:59.725 --> 36:02.228
Detective Annou didn't
check into work yesterday.

36:02.261 --> 36:03.329
And her father's
disappeared.

36:03.362 --> 36:05.864
What about her police vehicle?
Why can't we track that?

36:05.897 --> 36:07.633
Well, we could if
she was using it.

36:08.634 --> 36:10.602
But we did have the car's
GPS history checked out.

36:12.371 --> 36:15.374
Now three days ago, she paid a
visit to Dr. Everett's office.

36:15.841 --> 36:17.876
He did call in a missing
person's report on Lunsford,

36:17.909 --> 36:21.347
so it could be coincidence
that Annou responded.

36:21.380 --> 36:23.215
You don't believe that
any more than I do.

36:23.249 --> 36:24.583
Did Everett inform us
about her visit?

36:25.317 --> 36:26.352
No.

36:27.453 --> 36:28.487
Send someone to pick him up.

36:28.520 --> 36:29.621
I want to know what
they talked about.

36:48.640 --> 36:49.675
That's him.

36:51.810 --> 36:52.944
(TIRES SCREECHING)

36:52.978 --> 36:54.246

37:00.819 --> 37:01.820

Get up. Get the fuck up.

37:04.690 --> 37:05.857
Let's go!

37:11.697 --> 37:12.831
Go, go, go, go.

You people
are so fucked.

37:21.707 --> 37:22.841
(SIGHS)

37:25.344 --> 37:26.812
Who is this?

37:26.845 --> 37:27.946
I don't remember his name.

37:28.580 --> 37:30.015
Some guy who bought
us a drink.

37:31.016 --> 37:32.584
You don't have
a very good poker face, Neil.

37:33.719 --> 37:35.287
Well, it's the truth.

37:35.321 --> 37:36.455
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

37:37.689 --> 37:39.291
(SIGHS) Tell you what.

37:39.325 --> 37:40.359
Here, catch.

37:43.061 --> 37:44.563
You're a southpaw, huh?

37:45.864 --> 37:48.600
(SCREAMS) Fuck!
God damn it!

37:49.368 --> 37:50.869
Are you out of
your fucking mind?

37:50.902 --> 37:52.070
I just blew up the
federal building, Neil.

37:52.103 --> 37:53.339
What do you think?

37:53.372 --> 37:54.806
-(GROANS)
-You don't start telling

37:54.840 --> 37:55.907
me what I wanna know,

37:55.941 --> 37:57.843
and I'm gonna shoot you in
your good hand. You hear me?

37:58.610 --> 37:59.845
(PANTING)

38:01.513 --> 38:02.948
Who's the third man?

38:05.484 --> 38:07.986
Nicholas Brady!
Nicholas fucking Brady!

38:09.521 --> 38:11.022
-Good.
-Who is he?

38:13.725 --> 38:15.861
He works for
the government.

38:15.894 --> 38:17.596
The Department
of Science and Technology.

38:17.629 --> 38:19.064
Now, would you get me
something for the bleeding!

38:20.499 --> 38:22.468
Hold on. The government knows
that you were putting

38:22.501 --> 38:24.470
those chips
in trafficked girls?

38:26.037 --> 38:28.974
The girls are guinea pigs.
It's a clinical trial!

38:30.776 --> 38:33.044
Ombello runs it.
The government is funding it!

38:35.581 --> 38:36.982
Why? Why are
they doing that?

38:37.549 --> 38:39.385
I am bleeding out here!

38:39.718 --> 38:41.953
-Why? Why, Neil?
-(GRUNTS)

38:44.756 --> 38:46.592
They wanna use it
for soldiers.

38:48.159 --> 38:49.595
For what?

38:52.564 --> 38:54.533
Hey. For what?

38:54.566 --> 38:56.101
For what?

38:56.134 --> 38:59.705
The chip is designed
to impact neural pathways,

38:59.738 --> 39:03.409
to make the recipient
feel no pain, no fear.

39:04.543 --> 39:05.844
Do you have any idea
how beneficial

39:05.877 --> 39:07.012
something
like that would be?

39:08.079 --> 39:10.048
Or how difficult it would be
to keep a chip like that

39:10.081 --> 39:11.983
functioning in a human brain?

39:12.451 --> 39:14.085
How many girls died
for you to figure it out?

39:14.853 --> 39:17.689
Advances in science come
at a cost. They always have.

39:20.959 --> 39:22.528
Have you ever been
on the battlefield, Neil?

39:23.194 --> 39:24.496
No.

39:24.530 --> 39:25.897
You ever had
bullets flying at you?

39:26.598 --> 39:29.601
You ever hold your friend
in your arms while he dies?

Let me tell you something.

do with Phan?

I don't know
where they took her.

All right. You know what?
Fuck him, Clea.

40:10.576 --> 40:11.810

40:11.843 --> 40:12.878
You can't leave me here.

40:13.178 --> 40:15.146

those girls to starve

40:15.180 --> 40:17.115

You can't leave me! You can't
fucking leave me here!

40:22.120 --> 40:24.656
It was definitely Kelly
and Annou who took Everett?

40:24.690 --> 40:26.858
-Yes.
-Jesus H Christ.

40:26.892 --> 40:28.894
Well, this is turning out just
fucking peachy, isn't it?

40:30.028 --> 40:31.630
I didn't want to use
Kelly in the first place.

40:31.663 --> 40:33.198

could've handled this job?

six at ICE
and 11 at the ATF.

40:57.823 --> 41:00.659
delinquents, drug dealers,
felons and general lowlifes

41:00.692 --> 41:03.895
who are entirely dependent on
us for their sorry existence.

41:03.929 --> 41:07.165
I want every one of them,
every single one of them,

41:07.198 --> 41:09.200
out there looking for
Kelly and Annou.

41:09.234 --> 41:10.869
I want them found.

you still doing here?

Science and Technology.

41:52.578 --> 41:54.680
He lectures at conferences
all over the world

41:54.713 --> 41:55.947
on technology and hunger.

41:57.182 --> 41:59.250
Portugal. Czech Republic.
Finland...

42:00.752 --> 42:02.220
-Huh.
-What?

42:02.253 --> 42:03.855
Well, he was arrested
and detained

42:03.889 --> 42:05.957
a couple of years back
in Colombia.

42:05.991 --> 42:07.092
Oh, yeah?
What for?

42:07.593 --> 42:08.594
Doesn't say.

42:09.094 --> 42:10.295
Well, he's a
government official.

42:10.328 --> 42:11.830
There's got to be
a record somewhere.

42:11.863 --> 42:12.931
-Hmm.
-What about your partner?

42:14.766 --> 42:15.834
I mean, it's federal, so she

42:15.867 --> 42:17.603
doesn't have
that kind of access.

42:17.636 --> 42:19.237
But...

42:19.270 --> 42:20.972
You know who probably has

42:21.006 --> 42:22.874
a contact at the
US Attorney's office?

42:24.676 --> 42:25.777
Regan.

42:25.811 --> 42:27.012
Hmm.

42:39.991 --> 42:41.159

42:44.863 --> 42:46.131
What happened
to your face?

43:00.378 --> 43:01.847
No, I got rid of it.

43:04.816 --> 43:06.184
You know where
he is, don't you?

43:08.186 --> 43:10.121
Uh, don't tell me.
I don't wanna know.

43:13.191 --> 43:14.259
How is he?

43:14.793 --> 43:15.894
So, what? Now you care?

43:17.028 --> 43:19.164
I didn't have a choice, Clea.
The feds were all over me.

43:19.197 --> 43:21.132
What was I supposed to do?
Throw my life away for...

43:21.166 --> 43:22.367
For a friend?

43:23.769 --> 43:24.803
I don't feel guilty.

43:25.236 --> 43:27.172
Okay. So you
don't feel guilty.

43:28.707 --> 43:31.076
-What do you want?
-I need a favor.

43:31.677 --> 43:33.679
-For you or for him?
-Does that matter?

43:37.048 --> 43:40.886
I need you to find whatever
you can on a Nicholas Brady.

43:40.919 --> 43:42.888
He's at the Department of
Technology and Science.

43:43.254 --> 43:44.923
-Like what?
-Like why he was detained

43:44.956 --> 43:46.792
in Colombia two years ago.

43:46.825 --> 43:49.227
Like anything
I can't find on Google.

43:49.260 --> 43:51.897
He's involved in the
R and D on the microchips.

43:59.971 --> 44:02.340

My boss is on my case.

44:02.373 --> 44:03.942
I gotta keep
my nose clean.

44:03.975 --> 44:05.677
Ethan is a patsy.

44:05.711 --> 44:07.879
He was set up.
I know it. You know it.

44:07.913 --> 44:08.880
We just don't know why.

44:08.914 --> 44:11.216
And how does finding out
why this Nicholas Brady

44:11.249 --> 44:13.384
was arrested in Colombia
help us with that?

44:13.418 --> 44:15.086
I don't know. Not yet.

44:15.120 --> 44:16.154
But, fuck, the more that we

44:16.187 --> 44:17.288
understand about
what's going on,

44:17.322 --> 44:19.157
the closer
we get to the truth.

Wasn't so long ago
that Kelly stood in my office

44:25.797 --> 44:27.933
and said those same words.

44:27.966 --> 44:29.200
"Help me out, Regan."

44:31.970 --> 44:33.939
This isn't just
about Kelly.

He seemed nervous.

I'm just angry with myself
that I didn't spot something.

These people are good. I'm
starting to think I did it.

45:37.168 --> 45:38.503
Regan's looking into Brady.

45:39.437 --> 45:40.505
What'd you do
to convince her?

45:40.538 --> 45:43.441
Nothing. Clearly, I'm just
more charming than you are.

45:44.342 --> 45:45.343
Clearly.

45:47.578 --> 45:49.314
For what it's worth,

45:49.347 --> 45:51.316
she was put in an

45:51.817 --> 45:53.451
Yeah. Well, that doesn't
do a whole hell of a lot

46:50.008 --> 46:51.910
So, Nicholas Brady.

46:55.981 --> 46:58.216
I should ask
why you're having me

46:58.249 --> 47:00.151
looking into
a government official.

47:00.185 --> 47:03.388

I'd have to tell you.

47:05.623 --> 47:06.925
He checks out.

47:07.926 --> 47:10.395
He was detained in Colombia
on an expired visa.

47:12.030 --> 47:13.431
That's it?

47:13.464 --> 47:14.900

I take a look?

47:30.281 --> 47:31.549
He traveled to Libya?

47:32.517 --> 47:33.551
So?

47:35.086 --> 47:36.521
October 2011.

47:50.969 --> 47:52.603
Right before
Qaddafi was killed.

47:53.704 --> 47:55.373
You think the government
was allowing its officials

47:55.406 --> 47:57.142
to travel to Libya
at that time?

47:57.175 --> 47:58.944
Let alone an academic from

47:58.977 --> 48:00.946

And the manager of the market,
he took it, framed it

48:40.986 --> 48:43.054
and put it up
for everyone to see.

48:44.722 --> 48:46.091
