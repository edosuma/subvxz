08:12.200 --> 08:14.744
- Come here, sweetie.

08:14.786 --> 08:16.621
Aww! Come here, baby.

08:23.628 --> 08:25.297
till you're all better.

08:25.339 --> 08:26.881
No, no, she isn't.

08:25.339 --> 08:26.881
Mommy's gonna go to work.

08:26.923 --> 08:28.925
Look, look.

08:26.923 --> 08:28.925
I'll take care of the boys.

08:28.967 --> 08:31.845
You do the career thing,

08:28.967 --> 08:31.845
and I will do the parent thing.

08:31.886 --> 08:33.930
And what about your radio thing?

08:33.972 --> 08:35.474
- Oh, that.

08:33.972 --> 08:35.474
- You see, Jess?

08:35.515 --> 08:37.017
There you are.

08:35.515 --> 08:37.017
You wanna have another baby?

08:37.058 --> 08:39.560
Our lives

08:37.058 --> 08:39.560
are-are too busy already.

08:39.602 --> 08:41.729
Oh, honey, look. I have a

08:39.602 --> 08:41.729

08:41.771 --> 08:44.649
time, I'll do the show from here

08:44.691 --> 08:46.360
and that way,

08:44.691 --> 08:46.360
I can take care of the boys.

08:46.401 --> 08:47.735
Oh, yeah, and if we sell

08:46.401 --> 08:47.735
cotton candy

08:47.777 --> 08:50.613
we can turn this place

08:47.777 --> 08:50.613
into a carnival.

08:50.655 --> 08:53.283
Honey, I'm serious, now,

09:02.792 --> 09:06.004
Honey, look, in life,

09:02.792 --> 09:06.004

09:25.190 --> 09:28.193
Don't get your tail in a knot,

09:25.190 --> 09:28.193

09:30.529 --> 09:32.947
Oh, good. You gonna

09:32.989 --> 09:36.784
He doesn't like

09:32.989 --> 09:36.784
to be called<i> that pig.</i>

09:36.826 --> 09:39.913
Yeah, dad. You don't call

09:36.826 --> 09:39.913

09:39.954 --> 09:43.208
So from now on,

09:39.954 --> 09:43.208

09:45.252 --> 09:48.171
Alex, say hi to Scruffy.

09:48.213 --> 09:49.923

09:50.924 --> 09:53.218
Why do I even bother?

09:55.720 --> 09:57.638
- Alright, Alex is all yours.

09:55.720 --> 09:57.638
- Thank you.

09:57.680 --> 09:59.099
While I do the show.

09:59.140 --> 10:01.226
And, uh, Nicky's upstairs

09:59.140 --> 10:01.226

10:08.942 --> 10:11.361
Where's Joey? We're on the air

10:08.942 --> 10:11.361

10:11.403 --> 10:13.071
He went out rollerblading.

10:13.113 --> 10:16.991
Oh, one of the donut dive

10:17.033 --> 10:18.659
No, he's just,

10:17.033 --> 10:18.659
he's working out.

10:18.701 --> 10:20.287
Work out, well,

10:18.701 --> 10:20.287
if he's not back in five minutes

10:20.328 --> 10:21.329
he's gonna be out of work.

10:21.371 --> 10:22.372
- Give me a kiss.

10:21.371 --> 10:22.372
- Okay.

10:22.414 --> 10:24.874
- Not you.

10:22.414 --> 10:24.874
- I know.

10:24.916 --> 10:26.667
- Be a good boy.

10:24.916 --> 10:26.667
- 'See you later.'

10:26.709 --> 10:28.169
Now, Alex,

10:26.709 --> 10:28.169
today is your lucky day

10:28.211 --> 10:30.630
because you are gonna learn

10:28.211 --> 10:30.630

10:34.842 --> 10:36.803
Okay. You're all set

Thank you.

10:41.766 --> 10:43.977
Careful. Careful, buddy.

10:41.766 --> 10:43.977
Take it easy.

10:44.018 --> 10:46.771
- Ow, ow, ow.

10:44.018 --> 10:46.771
- Take it slowly.

10:46.813 --> 10:49.107
Careful, careful.

10:49.149 --> 10:50.484
Oh, man.

10:52.360 --> 10:54.070
What happened to you?

10:54.112 --> 10:56.781
I was rollerblading,

10:54.112 --> 10:56.781
and I had a little mishap.

10:56.823 --> 10:58.241
A little mishap?

10:58.283 --> 10:59.742
You told me you tripped over

10:58.283 --> 10:59.742
a garden hose

10:59.784 --> 11:00.827
fell into an open dumpster

11:00.868 --> 11:04.122
and then rolled down Nob Hill.

11:04.164 --> 11:07.167
That's a very common accident.

11:07.208 --> 11:09.836
I'll be fine. I just need

11:07.208 --> 11:09.836
