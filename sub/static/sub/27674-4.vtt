WEBVTT

00:02.059 --> 00:03.530
- [Loren] That's the Hunters.

00:03.530 --> 00:04.950
- There's a lot of movement.

00:04.950 --> 00:06.220
- Jess, Jess, climb over the fence.

00:06.220 --> 00:07.873
- At the back, at the back, at the back.

00:08.820 --> 00:09.653
- Go, go, go.

00:09.653 --> 00:10.683
- [Woman] Stop running!

00:12.396 --> 00:14.178
Your time on the run is over.

00:14.178 --> 00:15.666
- [Man] You've been hunted down.

00:15.666 --> 00:16.499
- Yes!

00:16.499 --> 00:17.332
Get in there.

00:18.290 --> 00:20.640
- [Narrator] Four fugitives
have been captured.

00:21.830 --> 00:23.723
Six remain on the run.

00:25.370 --> 00:28.030
If they evade the hunters for 25 days.

00:28.030 --> 00:29.610
- Oh, for God's sake, no.

00:29.610 --> 00:33.290
- [Narrator] They will win
a share of a 100,000 pounds.

00:33.290 --> 00:34.700
- Can't see Peter Bleksley to be honest

00:34.700 --> 00:36.113
in my frame comin' up here.

00:38.545 --> 00:41.220
- [Peter] He is essentially
an elite soldier.

00:41.220 --> 00:43.630
- He will revel in the
challenge of testin' us.

00:43.630 --> 00:46.060
- Definitely gonna go
and see my wife and son.

00:46.060 --> 00:48.160
Wipe that grin off Bleksley's face.

00:48.160 --> 00:48.993
It's okay.

00:51.760 --> 00:54.833
- Can somebody tell me
where Matt Mason is?

00:56.010 --> 00:56.953
Where is he?

00:58.623 --> 01:01.050
- It's been declined, what's going on?

01:01.050 --> 01:02.000
Assholes.

01:02.000 --> 01:04.236
We need to get to Huddersfield.

01:04.236 --> 01:05.390
Let's do this.

01:05.390 --> 01:06.670
- I've got an empty house in Huddersfield.

01:06.670 --> 01:08.340
You could do a couple of
nights there if you like.

01:08.340 --> 01:09.173
- Yeah.

01:09.173 --> 01:11.585
Let's just try and not get caught here.

01:11.585 --> 01:12.590
- I'm suggestin' they probably stayed

01:12.590 --> 01:13.580
at your house overnight.

01:13.580 --> 01:14.413
- You got it.

01:14.413 --> 01:15.520
- We're done, let's go.

01:15.520 --> 01:16.960
Get the call in to Ben now.

01:16.960 --> 01:20.530
We anticipate that they're
about to vacate Corby Street.

01:20.530 --> 01:22.853
- Let's bag ourselves some fugitives.

01:39.820 --> 01:41.750
- I'm not totally against
stayin' another night

01:41.750 --> 01:44.678
but it's just, when you're not sure.

01:44.678 --> 01:48.687
- Dude, I wanna leave as soon as possible.

01:48.687 --> 01:51.187
Like I can feel uncomfortable.

01:53.890 --> 01:56.700
- They would have no
reason to come in here.

01:56.700 --> 01:58.850
- [Narrator] Fugitives
Nathaniel and Ishmael

01:58.850 --> 02:01.450
are hiding out in a disused house owned

02:01.450 --> 02:03.904
by associate, John Fraud.

02:03.904 --> 02:06.654
(abrupt tapping)

02:08.660 --> 02:09.989
- Shall we have a look?

02:09.989 --> 02:11.362
What if it's John?

02:11.362 --> 02:14.232
- What if John's given them a message?

02:14.232 --> 02:17.232
(suspenseful music)

02:23.781 --> 02:26.932
- [Messenger] A message from
John, they're on to you, go.

02:26.932 --> 02:28.734
- Okay, wicked, thank you.

02:28.734 --> 02:31.276
Get the, we have to get out of here now.

02:31.276 --> 02:32.466
Get out of here.

02:32.466 --> 02:33.638
I'm freakin' out.

02:33.638 --> 02:36.480
(suspenseful music)

02:36.480 --> 02:38.230
- Ben, they're at Corby street now.

02:39.140 --> 02:41.478
He's rung him to tell him to get out.

02:41.478 --> 02:42.410
And he's admitted that to us.

02:42.410 --> 02:44.860
- What's your ETA at Corby Street?

02:44.860 --> 02:46.693
- 400 yards to target premises.

02:48.670 --> 02:50.043
- [Nathaniel] Ish, we need to go.

02:52.413 --> 02:53.910
Right, let's go out here now please.

02:53.910 --> 02:56.000
She said, go, that was it.

02:56.000 --> 02:58.697
Let's get outta here
mate, get outta here now.

03:01.240 --> 03:02.180
- [Hunter] Okay, we're entering

03:02.180 --> 03:04.140
the target premises area now.

03:04.140 --> 03:04.973
- Roger that.

03:08.563 --> 03:09.520
- [Ishmael] Right, ready?

03:09.520 --> 03:11.450
- So there's an alleyway next to it

03:11.450 --> 03:13.330
which is accessible from both sides.

03:13.330 --> 03:15.050
- Okay, right, I'll take the
front, you take the rear, yeah?

03:15.050 --> 03:16.750
We're covering front and rear now.

03:21.270 --> 03:22.973
- Go down the arched alleyway.

03:35.470 --> 03:38.120
- [Hunter] Anyone in the
property please, do open up.

03:46.880 --> 03:48.830
- John is, he's a legend.

03:48.830 --> 03:50.853
Change of plans, we're
gettin' out of Huddersfield.

03:52.300 --> 03:54.300
That was a wake up call.

03:55.320 --> 03:57.543
- Yeah, this looks empty, totally empty.

03:59.105 --> 03:59.938
- Roger.

04:01.200 --> 04:02.033
Come on (beep).

04:03.100 --> 04:04.530
- Oh man.

04:04.530 --> 04:06.113
That's so frustrating.

04:07.399 --> 04:08.580
- We'll get Mark and Cal
to remain in that area,

04:08.580 --> 04:10.360
going from house to house,

04:10.360 --> 04:11.601
and we'll look what cars are there.

04:11.601 --> 04:13.510
Gettin' a feel for
what's there, what's not.

04:13.510 --> 04:17.470
- We can be in street A,
they can be in street B

04:17.470 --> 04:19.020
and never the twain shall meet.

04:20.090 --> 04:23.253
One way or another we will
catch these fugitives.

04:24.180 --> 04:27.180
(suspenseful music)

04:30.920 --> 04:35.040
Okay ladies and gentlemen,
time is not on our side.

04:35.040 --> 04:37.573
I don't want anything
slipping through the cracks.

04:39.500 --> 04:42.270
- [Narrator] The remaining
fugitives have gone to ground

04:42.270 --> 04:45.193
in rural locations across the U.K.

04:46.830 --> 04:48.833
- Okay, where are we at with Loren?

04:49.995 --> 04:51.480
- [Zoe] Loren sent you a
postcard, boss, did she?

04:51.480 --> 04:53.229
- [Peter] Yeah, from Scotland.

04:53.229 --> 04:55.360
Had a gorgeous highland cow on it.

04:55.360 --> 04:56.193
- Cheeky bugger.

04:57.900 --> 04:59.980
- I'm gonna count how
many cars don't stop.

04:59.980 --> 05:04.980
Three, four, five, six, seven.

05:05.190 --> 05:06.293
Maybe if I smile.

05:12.586 --> 05:14.830
- [Ben] Macho marine, Matt Mason.

05:14.830 --> 05:17.200
- [ Zoe] We believe that
he just met his missus.

05:17.200 --> 05:18.900
- He feels elated he's done it,

05:18.900 --> 05:20.210
probably feels quite confident

05:20.210 --> 05:22.670
that we're not on his trail whatsoever.

05:22.670 --> 05:25.860
- He is all about winning
at everything and anything.

05:25.860 --> 05:28.770
- [Zoe] I think Matt's a
very, very cocky character.

05:28.770 --> 05:30.070
He's gonna wanna show off.

05:33.723 --> 05:34.833
- Couldn't have high fived me then.

05:35.850 --> 05:39.425
I'm ready to take the
fight to the hunters.

05:39.425 --> 05:41.925
We're gonna get him, you know.

05:43.160 --> 05:45.793
I think it's time to give 'em a slap.

05:50.240 --> 05:53.210
- Frank and Harry Savage were
seen at the shooting range

05:53.210 --> 05:55.930
in Doveridge in the Derbyshire area.

05:55.930 --> 05:58.182
Now we're confident it is a decoy

05:58.182 --> 05:59.790
to try and drag us up to that area.

05:59.790 --> 06:01.750
- It's just where are they gonna go now?

06:01.750 --> 06:04.810
All of their network is down in the area

06:04.810 --> 06:07.130
that they live and they're
very, very dependent

06:07.130 --> 06:07.963
on their network.

06:07.963 --> 06:09.130
- They're not the sort of people

06:09.130 --> 06:11.290
that are used to
traveling around actually.

06:11.290 --> 06:13.000
They're small town boys.

06:13.000 --> 06:14.750
- I think, yeah, with these two,

06:14.750 --> 06:17.134
I think they would return home.

06:17.134 --> 06:18.431
(electronic beeping)

06:18.431 --> 06:21.043
(birds chirping)
(upbeat music)

06:21.043 --> 06:23.250
(man screams)

06:23.250 --> 06:24.110
- Everything's just going wrong.

06:24.110 --> 06:25.960
My lip balm just melted.

06:25.960 --> 06:28.500
I'm never going on the run ever again?

06:28.500 --> 06:29.333
- [Frank] Ready Harry?

06:29.333 --> 06:30.166
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

06:30.166 --> 06:31.060
- [Harry] Yeah.

06:31.060 --> 06:32.680
Let's do this.

06:32.680 --> 06:34.690
- [Narrator] After walking
south for two weeks,

06:34.690 --> 06:36.270
brothers Frank and Harry are back

06:36.270 --> 06:39.040
in their home county of Sussex.

06:39.040 --> 06:40.010
- If we carry on the way we are,

06:40.010 --> 06:41.700
we're gonna run ourselves into the ground.

06:41.700 --> 06:43.367
We've walked over 100 miles

06:43.367 --> 06:47.260
so the plan today is we're
gonna try find our way

06:47.260 --> 06:48.740
to go home.

06:48.740 --> 06:50.033
- I just wanna get home and do it

06:50.033 --> 06:51.510
'cause I'm tired and my feet hurt.

06:51.510 --> 06:53.700
- Get Harry in the
shower sooner than later

06:53.700 --> 06:55.200
'cause he smells.

06:55.200 --> 06:56.320
- Stop saying I smell.

06:56.320 --> 06:57.153
- Well, you do.

06:57.153 --> 06:58.440
- You're moaning at me
for wanting the shower

06:58.440 --> 06:59.410
and you're telling me I smell

06:59.410 --> 07:01.260
and you're telling me that I look grim.

07:01.260 --> 07:02.943
You're telling me that I look
bad every minute of the day.

07:02.943 --> 07:04.140
- Nah, you're beautiful really.

07:04.140 --> 07:04.973
Not every minute.

07:04.973 --> 07:06.196
- Stop winding me up.

07:06.196 --> 07:07.873
- [Frank] You're getting well stroppy.

07:07.873 --> 07:09.163
- Yeah, 'cause you're pissing me off.

07:16.482 --> 07:17.315
Ow.

07:18.400 --> 07:21.560
I would say our family is a
but of a dysfunctional family.

07:21.560 --> 07:23.540
I wouldn't say we're a normal.
- Dysfunctional?

07:23.540 --> 07:24.930
- Is that the word?

07:24.930 --> 07:26.180
What does that word mean?

07:27.120 --> 07:28.963
We're definitely not a normal family.

07:30.057 --> 07:33.850
As a kid, I wasn't able
to say Frank's name.

07:33.850 --> 07:34.910
I couldn't say the word Frank.

07:34.910 --> 07:36.480
When I said it, it sounded like wank

07:36.480 --> 07:38.190
so I was told not to say it.

07:38.190 --> 07:39.343
So I'd say like wank.

07:40.260 --> 07:41.093
- [Frank] I started lookin' out

07:41.093 --> 07:43.203
for Harry ever since he's
a little kid, really.

07:44.407 --> 07:46.680
- Probably like when dad died

07:46.680 --> 07:48.830
'cause then mum got
ill shortly after that.

07:50.160 --> 07:52.840
- Growing up, me and Harry
we've been through quite a lot.

07:52.840 --> 07:54.295
When bad things happen,

07:54.295 --> 07:56.293
it brings you tighter together so.

07:58.820 --> 08:02.620
- You never expect for you to
lose one parent let alone two.

08:02.620 --> 08:05.160
It is still all very raw even, you know,

08:05.160 --> 08:07.010
mum only died in the last four months

08:08.645 --> 08:09.950
and I think I'm still working a way out

08:09.950 --> 08:11.200
how to cope with it.

08:15.744 --> 08:17.286
- But we're both all right.

08:17.286 --> 08:18.453
- Yeah, Frank.

08:25.493 --> 08:28.140
It def changes everything.

08:28.140 --> 08:31.050
But from it, all of our siblings

08:31.050 --> 08:32.960
have got far much more closer.

08:32.960 --> 08:35.415
We're the closest siblings that I know.

08:35.415 --> 08:38.415
(suspenseful music)

08:41.150 --> 08:43.480
- With the Savages, we feel
they're going back down

08:43.480 --> 08:44.860
towards home region.

08:44.860 --> 08:47.800
Lookin' at the fact that
their mother, Caroline,

08:47.800 --> 08:50.340
died earlier this year,
you know, this is fresh.

08:50.340 --> 08:53.330
Will that play on their
emotional behavior?

08:53.330 --> 08:55.060
Who are they likely to reach out to?

08:55.060 --> 08:57.420
What person in their network
would they really wanna see?

08:57.420 --> 08:59.160
- They've got a sister called Lizzie.

08:59.160 --> 09:00.326
- [Peter] Does he live with Lizzie?

09:00.326 --> 09:01.280
- [Ben] Frank?

09:01.280 --> 09:02.113
- [Peter] Yeah.

09:02.113 --> 09:02.946
- [Ben] Yes he does.

09:02.946 --> 09:05.230
- Lizzie, as the eldest
female in that family,

09:05.230 --> 09:06.770
the mother is out of the picture

09:06.770 --> 09:08.470
and the father is out of the picture,

09:08.470 --> 09:12.122
is she mothering these boys?

09:12.122 --> 09:13.470
- Well, it could be a nice
little family reunion for them

09:13.470 --> 09:15.275
half way through their time on the run.

09:15.275 --> 09:16.840
Little bit of a morale
booster, push them over.

09:16.840 --> 09:20.450
- Right, so we need hunters
to be across their addresses

09:20.450 --> 09:22.723
and to see what they can uncover.

09:26.310 --> 09:27.330
- Harry, let's think proper now, like,

09:27.330 --> 09:29.260
what are we doing, mate?

09:29.260 --> 09:31.618
- We're gonna go to Matt and
Lee's which is near here,

09:31.618 --> 09:32.880
that's a pub.

09:32.880 --> 09:35.090
- [Narrator] Wanting a
break from wild camping,

09:35.090 --> 09:37.940
Frank and Harry are
seeking refuge at a pub run

09:37.940 --> 09:39.393
by their close friends.

09:40.770 --> 09:43.028
- [Harry] I can't wait to get there now.

09:43.028 --> 09:43.861
- [Frank] Harry, is there now way

09:43.861 --> 09:45.013
like over the shops, like this way?

09:45.862 --> 09:47.981
- [Harry] There's a fence at the back but.

09:47.981 --> 09:48.814
- [Frank] Can't we jump the fence?

09:48.814 --> 09:49.647
- [Harry] Do you wanna do that?

09:49.647 --> 09:50.852
- [Frank] Yeah.

09:50.852 --> 09:53.120
- Frank, you wait here,
come here, come here.

09:53.120 --> 09:55.570
- [Frank] Oh mate, this is so risky mate.

09:55.570 --> 09:57.740
- [Harry] Frank, you wait here.

09:57.740 --> 09:59.683
- [Frank] Be quick Harry, let's do this.

10:03.459 --> 10:04.470
- [Harry] Is he workin'?

10:04.470 --> 10:05.303
He is, he is.

10:10.750 --> 10:13.110
We need your help, we're
in big, big trouble.

10:13.110 --> 10:14.074
- Are you?

10:14.074 --> 10:15.963
Hello darling.

10:15.963 --> 10:18.713
- [Harry] Yeah, Frank, it's fine.

10:21.387 --> 10:22.444
- All right, gorgeous.

10:22.444 --> 10:23.526
- [Frank] Oh mate.

10:23.526 --> 10:24.688
We're both fucked.

10:24.688 --> 10:25.635
- You are.

10:25.635 --> 10:28.191
- [Harry] We haven't had a
shower in a week, a week.

10:28.191 --> 10:29.480
- [Lee] Harry, for you
that's pretty serious.

10:29.480 --> 10:30.940
- I know.

10:30.940 --> 10:31.773
- Refreshments.

10:31.773 --> 10:32.775
- Can we stay here tonight?

10:32.775 --> 10:33.608
- [Lee] Of course.

10:33.608 --> 10:34.441
- [Matt C] Yeah, if you want, yeah.

10:34.441 --> 10:36.120
- [Harry] So we have one
night, we can wash our clothes,

10:36.120 --> 10:36.979
we can sleep, and we can have a shower.

10:36.979 --> 10:38.099
- Yeah, that's fine.

10:38.099 --> 10:39.307
- Do you reckon you could
cook us dinner tonight?

10:39.307 --> 10:40.872
- Of course I'll cook you dinner.

10:40.872 --> 10:41.705
- Cheers, sweetheart.

10:41.705 --> 10:42.614
- Do you want lasagna?

10:42.614 --> 10:44.279
- (gasps) lasagna!

10:44.279 --> 10:47.070
(men laughing)

10:47.070 --> 10:48.073
- You're disgusting.

10:51.173 --> 10:53.120
Pork, beans, bread.

10:53.120 --> 10:54.109
It's on the run food.

10:54.109 --> 10:54.942
- Thank you.

10:54.942 --> 10:57.360
- Fugitive food mate, oh, beautiful.

10:57.360 --> 10:59.030
- [Harry] We've landed on our feet.

10:59.030 --> 10:59.863
- If we're completely honest,

10:59.863 --> 11:01.150
we were beaten to our knees today

11:01.150 --> 11:03.040
and they've pulled us back up

11:03.040 --> 11:05.540
and just to see people,

11:05.540 --> 11:08.147
I mean, it's amazing what
just seeing someone can do.

11:12.800 --> 11:14.240
- [Narrator] Nine miles away,

11:14.240 --> 11:15.950
ground hunters have gained access

11:15.950 --> 11:19.063
to the cottage Frank shares
with his sister, Lizzie.

11:23.809 --> 11:25.230
- We're gonna put in an
internet enabled camera

11:25.230 --> 11:26.290
and listening device.

11:26.290 --> 11:28.633
Which we're trying to secret
now within the radiator.

11:29.730 --> 11:31.400
Okay, yeah, that's looking good.

11:31.400 --> 11:32.750
Right, we're all online, good to go.

11:32.750 --> 11:35.263
- Okay, okay, let's get out of here.

11:36.380 --> 11:38.850
- [Narrator] The hunters
have also put a covert camera

11:38.850 --> 11:40.750
on the exterior of the property

11:40.750 --> 11:43.633
to notify HQ of any unusual activity.

11:44.620 --> 11:45.913
- [Ground Hunter] Lizzie is in play.

11:45.913 --> 11:46.903
- [Ben] Great work, cheers.

11:53.030 --> 11:55.070
- What are you gonna do now?

11:55.070 --> 11:56.530
If you wanna make contact with Lizzie?

11:56.530 --> 11:57.520
- [Frank] Yeah?

11:57.520 --> 12:00.040
- We can do it, and I can
get Matt to drive there.

12:00.040 --> 12:01.193
Do you know what I mean?

12:01.193 --> 12:03.040
- I think my sister'd
be worried about us two

12:03.040 --> 12:05.510
and obviously she's like
the mum of the family,

12:05.510 --> 12:07.260
she's always wants to know what's going on

12:07.260 --> 12:08.544
or have contact with us

12:08.544 --> 12:09.420
and I think she has struggled not having

12:09.420 --> 12:10.853
any contact with us.

12:10.853 --> 12:13.186
All right, let's do it then.

12:15.150 --> 12:16.510
- [Narrator] The boys have
asked their friend Matt

12:16.510 --> 12:19.663
to go to the cottage to
arrange a meet with Lizzie.

12:27.400 --> 12:28.233
- Lizzie?

12:30.280 --> 12:31.113
Hello?

12:32.890 --> 12:33.987
All right, let's go.

12:39.080 --> 12:41.028
- Ladies and gentlemen, Harry and Frank.

12:41.028 --> 12:42.710
We've had a sighting

12:42.710 --> 12:44.933
of an unidentified male
at Lizzie's cottage.

12:48.270 --> 12:49.890
- Seen entering and leaving the property

12:49.890 --> 12:51.993
at approximately 19:14.

12:54.000 --> 12:56.220
- Is it one of their co-conspirators?

12:56.220 --> 12:59.960
That information could potentially
give us their location.

12:59.960 --> 13:01.973
We need to know who that is.

13:13.470 --> 13:15.969
Okay, where are we at with Loren?

13:15.969 --> 13:17.100
- [Woman In Red Top] Loren's postcard,

13:17.100 --> 13:19.760
we couldn't get CCTV
from where it was sent.

13:19.760 --> 13:20.884
- [Ben] Where was it sent?

13:20.884 --> 13:23.740
- It was sent from
Pitlochry in the highlands.

13:23.740 --> 13:26.480
- The only reasoning behind
it is to try and drag us

13:26.480 --> 13:28.980
up to that area days after she was there

13:28.980 --> 13:30.737
while she's on her toes south.

13:30.737 --> 13:31.570
- [Woman In Red Top] Yeah.

13:31.570 --> 13:34.730
- Okay, what about social media for Loren?

13:34.730 --> 13:36.690
- I think that would be very effective.

13:36.690 --> 13:38.225
- We know she went to Fort William

13:38.225 --> 13:40.450
and those other areas and
actually we can target

13:40.450 --> 13:43.280
the Facebook ads to
those geographic areas.

13:43.280 --> 13:44.113
- Let's do it.

13:46.100 --> 13:49.540
- [Narrator] HQ hopes that
offering a reward on social media

13:49.540 --> 13:51.310
will give them a new lead

13:51.310 --> 13:53.723
to establish Loren's whereabouts.

13:55.479 --> 13:57.122
- I'd love it if this comes off.

13:57.122 --> 13:58.140
- We'll see.

13:58.140 --> 13:59.520
Hope spring eternal.

14:01.672 --> 14:04.255
(upbeat music)

14:06.487 --> 14:08.970
- If I do it like leaning forward

14:08.970 --> 14:10.733
and like slower, it's easier.

14:12.100 --> 14:14.680
- [Narrator] 215 miles from Pitlochry,

14:14.680 --> 14:17.520
fugitive Loren is hiking south.

14:17.520 --> 14:19.320
- I've worked it out, the
littler the steps you take,

14:19.320 --> 14:20.743
the easier it seems to feel.

14:22.390 --> 14:24.890
I live like a literally a
three minute walk to the shops

14:24.890 --> 14:26.040
and I drive.

14:26.040 --> 14:29.090
My sister lives the next turn into me.

14:29.090 --> 14:30.400
I drive there.

14:30.400 --> 14:32.377
And now I'm doing a 15 mile walk

14:32.377 --> 14:33.640
through very big hills

14:33.640 --> 14:34.870
which I like to call mountains

14:34.870 --> 14:37.210
but I don't think they're
big enough to be mountains.

14:37.210 --> 14:38.043
So high.

14:38.930 --> 14:41.350
So out of breath but so high.

14:41.350 --> 14:42.820
Wow.

14:42.820 --> 14:45.420
I feel good because it's
something I never done before.

14:45.420 --> 14:46.500
So it's something to be proud of

14:46.500 --> 14:49.197
like another thing that I've accomplished.

14:50.240 --> 14:52.590
I'll call mountain rescue
if worse comes to it.

14:54.100 --> 14:58.690
The whole of my life, I've
kind of been sheltered as such.

14:58.690 --> 15:01.383
I spent a lot of time indoors,
a lot of time with my mum.

15:02.500 --> 15:04.060
My mum's been really unwell.

15:04.060 --> 15:06.860
She suffered with
agoraphobia for a long time

15:06.860 --> 15:08.280
and she's hasn't got anyone else.

15:08.280 --> 15:09.750
No matter what I do,
in the back of my head,

15:09.750 --> 15:11.420
I'm always thinkin'
gotta get home for mum,

15:11.420 --> 15:12.880
can't be out too long, must text her,

15:12.880 --> 15:14.650
must keep in contact.

15:14.650 --> 15:16.820
If I won a share of that money

15:16.820 --> 15:19.864
it would be completely life changin'.

15:19.864 --> 15:21.580
I'd like to give it to my mum

15:21.580 --> 15:24.140
to pay for her to have
private medical care

15:24.140 --> 15:25.700
and hopefully get somewhere with her

15:25.700 --> 15:27.063
and help her get better.

15:29.830 --> 15:31.170
I'm missin' home quite a bit

15:31.170 --> 15:32.970
so it'd be nice to be
able to just see someone

15:32.970 --> 15:35.790
even if it's just for like
five minutes for a cuddle.

15:35.790 --> 15:37.200
I just want a cuddle.

15:38.307 --> 15:39.850
And if I could just know that mum's okay,

15:39.850 --> 15:42.100
that'd maybe make me relax a bit.

15:42.100 --> 15:45.543
So I've like devised this
plan to meet my sisters.

15:47.830 --> 15:49.490
Of findin' someone real random,

15:49.490 --> 15:52.350
just to use their phone,
to get in touch with

15:52.350 --> 15:54.070
one of my best friend's boyfriends.

15:54.070 --> 15:55.700
Sorry to bother ya, I'm on the run

15:55.700 --> 15:58.090
and I need to use someone's phone.

15:58.090 --> 15:59.340
- You can use the landline.

15:59.340 --> 16:00.173
- Is that all right?

16:00.173 --> 16:01.250
Brilliant.

16:01.250 --> 16:03.930
Get Kieron to go to my sister's house

16:03.930 --> 16:07.050
and then tell them where
I want them to meet me.

16:07.050 --> 16:11.360
Meet me Saturday the 23rd at four o'clock

16:11.360 --> 16:14.520
at Kiwi Park, Derby.

16:14.520 --> 16:15.770
Just because it's random.

16:16.810 --> 16:18.120
It'd be nice to like just to quickly say

16:18.120 --> 16:20.740
like how's mum and just get
like a little bit of insight

16:20.740 --> 16:22.790
into what's been goin' on at home really.

16:24.205 --> 16:25.038
All right.

16:27.691 --> 16:29.750
Feel well naughty.

16:29.750 --> 16:31.110
I'm just hoping that I can pull it off

16:31.110 --> 16:33.923
without getting caught or
without the hunters catching on.

16:35.380 --> 16:36.213
We'll see.

16:37.660 --> 16:39.710
- [Cameraman] How you gonna get to Derby?

16:40.571 --> 16:42.213
- I don't know.

16:42.213 --> 16:43.463
I was just gonna wing it.

16:44.350 --> 16:45.983
Don't even know where Derby is.

16:52.248 --> 16:54.385
- [Peter] Okay, Frank and Harry.

16:54.385 --> 16:56.168
We need to know who that is.

16:56.168 --> 16:57.730
- [Zoe] He does look, he
looks really stressed.

16:57.730 --> 16:58.800
- [Peter] We've gotta be across

16:58.800 --> 17:03.063
every known contact's
Facebook, finances, the lot.

17:04.031 --> 17:04.864
- We're lookin' into that now,

17:04.864 --> 17:06.110
chasin' up further information.

17:06.110 --> 17:07.943
Get that across to you
as soon as we've got it.

17:08.940 --> 17:11.070
- [Narrator] After
investigating Frank and Harry's

17:11.070 --> 17:15.660
online network, HQ identify
the man seen at the cottage.

17:15.660 --> 17:19.020
- The person picked up on the
sentry cam was Matt Crisp.

17:19.020 --> 17:20.833
- As in like cheese and onion?

17:22.820 --> 17:26.150
Matt is associated to a
bloke called Lee Hughes.

17:26.150 --> 17:28.320
We do some checks on
Lee Hughes, he's linked

17:28.320 --> 17:30.650
on social media to Frank and Harry.

17:30.650 --> 17:33.800
Both Lee and Matt own the Anchor Inn.

17:33.800 --> 17:36.670
Matt Crisp and Lee Hughes
are in a relationship.

17:36.670 --> 17:40.160
- Okay, we need Crisp on
live interceptor, Matt.

17:40.160 --> 17:41.413
- [Matt] On it now, chief.

17:43.920 --> 17:45.974
- [Matt C] Right, what's your plan?

17:45.974 --> 17:49.930
- What's key for us today is
me and Harry get out of here.

17:49.930 --> 17:51.460
- [Narrator] After failing to get in touch

17:51.460 --> 17:54.060
with sister Lizzie, Frank
and Harry have spent

17:54.060 --> 17:56.520
the night with friends, Matt and Lee.

17:56.520 --> 17:57.360
- [Frank] Yeah, we pushed our luck

17:57.360 --> 17:58.640
and we've overstayed our welcome.

17:58.640 --> 18:01.260
- We've refueled, good
night's sleep, shower,

18:01.260 --> 18:02.510
it's back to roughin' it.

18:04.160 --> 18:06.045
- We've got all of their phones, handsets,

18:06.045 --> 18:07.380
everything on intercept.

18:07.380 --> 18:08.910
- [Peter] Scramble the troops.

18:08.910 --> 18:11.890
- Right, okay associate of
Harry and Frank, Matt Crisp.

18:11.890 --> 18:12.723
- Okay.

18:12.723 --> 18:15.630
- There's a possibility that
one or the other is with him.

18:15.630 --> 18:17.250
The pub's the Anchor Inn.

18:17.250 --> 18:18.200
- Anchor Inn.

18:18.200 --> 18:19.350
- Go down there, have a look round.

18:19.350 --> 18:21.410
See what you can see, good luck.

18:21.410 --> 18:22.243
Bye, bye, bye.

18:24.828 --> 18:27.050
- [Narrator] At the pub,
Frank and Harry are preparing

18:27.050 --> 18:29.623
for their final nine days on the run.

18:36.880 --> 18:37.981
- Lizzie.

18:37.981 --> 18:40.549
(phone ringing)

18:40.549 --> 18:41.966
- [Frank] Answer.

18:43.363 --> 18:44.196
- Hello?

18:45.572 --> 18:46.548
- [Lizzie] Hello?

18:46.548 --> 18:48.004
- Hello darling, you all right?

18:48.004 --> 18:49.462
How's it going?

18:49.462 --> 18:51.051
- [Lizzie] It would be really nice

18:51.051 --> 18:52.090
to see the boys this morning.

18:52.090 --> 18:52.923
- Okay.

18:52.923 --> 18:54.626
- [Lizzie] Maybe we
could go for breakfast,

18:54.626 --> 18:55.961
like a King's breakfast.

18:55.961 --> 18:56.942
If they can be there in about?

18:56.942 --> 18:58.612
- A King's breakfast?

18:58.612 --> 18:59.907
- [Lizzie] Yeah, a King's
breakfast in about.

18:59.907 --> 19:00.740
- I know, I know exactly where.

19:00.740 --> 19:01.627
- [Lizzie] In about 15, 20 minutes yeah.

19:01.627 --> 19:02.460
- All right.

19:02.460 --> 19:03.293
- All right, that's fine, that's fine,

19:03.293 --> 19:04.126
that's fine, that's fine.

19:04.126 --> 19:04.959
- [Lizzie] All right, I'll see you then.

19:04.959 --> 19:05.969
- All right, bye.

19:05.969 --> 19:07.663
- [Lizzie] Bye.

19:07.663 --> 19:11.510
- The roundabout by Lewis

19:11.510 --> 19:13.530
where the burger van is on the left.

19:13.530 --> 19:14.363
- [Frank] Kingston?

19:14.363 --> 19:15.340
- Kingston roundabout.

19:15.340 --> 19:16.440
It's not called King's.

19:16.440 --> 19:17.680
- Kingston.

19:17.680 --> 19:18.850
- But she always, we always
called it a King's breakfast.

19:18.850 --> 19:19.935
- [Matt C] 'Cause it's
on Kingston Roundabout.

19:19.935 --> 19:22.022
- 'Cause it's on the Kingston Roundabout.

19:22.022 --> 19:23.222
Where the burger van is.

19:29.070 --> 19:30.490
- [Matt C] Is that dangerous though?

19:30.490 --> 19:31.323
- [Frank] Yeah.

19:33.644 --> 19:34.623
- [Matt C] It's up to you two.

19:34.623 --> 19:35.680
If you think it's too risky.

19:35.680 --> 19:36.513
- [Harry] Let's do it.

19:36.513 --> 19:37.670
- All right, let's do this.

19:37.670 --> 19:38.503
Let's get gone.
- We have to go,

19:38.503 --> 19:40.999
it's eight o'clock.
- All right.

19:49.130 --> 19:51.800
- So we've just got some activity.

19:51.800 --> 19:56.800
Matt Crisp has received a
call at 8:02 this morning.

19:57.050 --> 19:58.900
- The call came from Lizzie Savage

19:58.900 --> 20:00.850
and lasted for 37 seconds.

20:00.850 --> 20:03.140
- [Zoe] It was a Facebook
call, usin' the Facebook app.

20:03.140 --> 20:05.970
- [Ben] So Lizzie's rung in to Matt.

20:05.970 --> 20:08.520
- I think that Lee and Matt
are moving Harry and Frank

20:08.520 --> 20:09.840
around the area this morning.

20:09.840 --> 20:11.994
- We've got cell-sat information.

20:11.994 --> 20:13.144
We can track the phone.

20:14.780 --> 20:17.063
- [Brunette Woman] Cor,
if we get a capture today.

20:20.559 --> 20:22.183
- Cor, I can't wait to
see Lizzie and her baby.

20:22.183 --> 20:23.060
- That would be really good to see her.

20:23.060 --> 20:24.279
- Never thought I'd miss her.

20:24.279 --> 20:26.513
- Never thought I'd miss her.

20:26.513 --> 20:27.550
If we get away with this,

20:27.550 --> 20:29.160
this is gonna be like ace.

20:29.160 --> 20:30.810
- Right, we're not far away then.

20:34.742 --> 20:36.635
- Oh no, we've got a Volvo behind.

20:36.635 --> 20:37.509
- What?

20:37.509 --> 20:38.662
- Black Volvo.

20:38.662 --> 20:40.413
- [Frank] It's three cars
behind us, the Volvo.

20:44.500 --> 20:45.430
- Black or?

20:45.430 --> 20:46.740
- Black.

20:46.740 --> 20:49.000
Go left, I wanna see what they do.

20:49.000 --> 20:52.000
We'll just see if he indicates here.

20:53.076 --> 20:54.350
Oh, no, all right, it's BM.

20:54.350 --> 20:56.472
Thank fuck for that.

20:56.472 --> 20:57.820
Right, the moment of truth, Harry.

20:57.820 --> 20:58.993
Fix up, look sharp.

21:00.620 --> 21:01.606
Just wait here.

21:01.606 --> 21:02.439
- Okay, (mumbles) Frank.

21:02.439 --> 21:03.272
- I will.

21:07.460 --> 21:09.410
- [Narrator] The hunters have
tracked Frank and Harry's

21:09.410 --> 21:11.900
suspected locating using cell data

21:11.900 --> 21:14.660
from the phone in Matt Crisp's car.

21:14.660 --> 21:16.150
- They've driven down to here.

21:16.150 --> 21:17.040
- Yep.

21:17.040 --> 21:19.053
- Then they appear to
have gone up a junction

21:19.053 --> 21:20.280
on the A-27.
- Right.

21:20.280 --> 21:22.232
- Then this triangulation
could be them comin' up

21:22.232 --> 21:24.000
on that junction and heading back in.

21:24.000 --> 21:25.270
- [Brunette Woman] We're
looking for a drop off

21:25.270 --> 21:29.448
and a pick up point
within that triangulation.

21:29.448 --> 21:31.218
- There's a car park just there

21:31.218 --> 21:33.100
so this is the road we're talkin' about.

21:33.100 --> 21:34.913
There's this little burger stand

21:34.913 --> 21:37.832
and little point there they can come off.

21:37.832 --> 21:39.250
- That would make sense, wouldn't it?

21:39.250 --> 21:40.280
- [Brunette Man] Yeah.

21:40.280 --> 21:41.930
- Come on, we're all over the Savages,

21:41.930 --> 21:45.021
we'll havin' them by close up later today.

21:45.021 --> 21:46.064
(suspenseful music)

21:46.064 --> 21:47.240
- Dan, Jordan, we got
some intel coming through

21:47.240 --> 21:48.180
at the moment guys.

21:48.180 --> 21:49.490
- On the Savages?

21:49.490 --> 21:52.060
- Yeah, we need you to
head to a burger van.

21:52.060 --> 21:54.810
That burger van is in a
lay-by off Kingston Roundabout

21:54.810 --> 21:57.537
in the alpha two seven
just outside of Lewis.

21:57.537 --> 21:59.361
- Come on.
- Come on.

21:59.361 --> 22:00.800
- I've got a ground
hunt team 11 minutes out

22:00.800 --> 22:01.910
so this is on.

22:06.309 --> 22:07.559
- Come on, Liz.

22:10.369 --> 22:12.517
I mean, I thought she'd
be here by now but, dunno,

22:13.970 --> 22:16.170
maybe someone's, hunters
have picked her up.

22:18.843 --> 22:20.520
- 2.6 mile, ETA four minutes.

22:23.600 --> 22:24.600
- [Matt] If she doesn't turn up,

22:24.600 --> 22:26.320
you think that means
she'd have been followed.

22:26.320 --> 22:27.300
How long do you wanna give it?

22:27.300 --> 22:28.670
That's what, I think you
need to think about that.

22:28.670 --> 22:30.632
- She said 15, 20 minutes.

22:30.632 --> 22:31.540
- [Frank] There she is, yes!

22:31.540 --> 22:35.800
- [Matt] She's there,
she's there, she's there.

22:35.800 --> 22:38.204
Sit in the car or something, I don't know.

22:38.204 --> 22:39.037
- Liz!

22:39.037 --> 22:41.885
Fuckin' hell, it's good to see ya.

22:41.885 --> 22:43.075
Fuckin' hell.

22:43.075 --> 22:46.254
I knew you (mumbles).

22:46.254 --> 22:47.440
- I missed you guys.

22:47.440 --> 22:48.273
- We have to be quick though.

22:48.273 --> 22:49.482
Yeah, I know, I did know we'd miss you.

22:49.482 --> 22:50.530
- Oh my god, it's all going pink Tom.

22:50.530 --> 22:52.357
I was worried that I was
gonna get followed here

22:52.357 --> 22:53.297
'cause they've been literally all over.

22:53.297 --> 22:54.130
- Mate, we walked here.

22:54.130 --> 22:55.665
- Have you been eatin' properly?

22:55.665 --> 22:57.015
You look so thin, Harry.

22:57.015 --> 22:58.746
People keep questioning me.
- Liz, love, ya, we're off.

22:58.746 --> 22:59.744
Love ya, we're off.

22:59.744 --> 23:00.991
- I love you so much.

23:00.991 --> 23:01.824
- [Frank] See you in nine days, yeah?

23:01.824 --> 23:02.657
- Yeah, you can do this.

23:02.657 --> 23:03.490
You've got literally.
- Wait, hold on, hold on.

23:03.490 --> 23:04.586
- Nine days to do, you can do it.

23:04.586 --> 23:05.419
- Wait, wait, wait.
- Have you got

23:05.419 --> 23:06.252
any money on you?

23:06.252 --> 23:07.337
- Yeah, I've got cash in
my car, do you want it?

23:07.337 --> 23:08.500
- What a tenner or something.

23:08.500 --> 23:09.679
- Yeah, I've got 50 quid.

23:09.679 --> 23:11.493
- Grab it, quick, quick Liz.

23:14.380 --> 23:17.803
- Come on boys, let's go get
the fuck out of here now.

23:21.439 --> 23:24.606
- We're literally just
over a mile out now.

23:24.606 --> 23:26.110
- Oh my god, gonna fucking piss myself.

23:26.110 --> 23:27.423
Better catch these fuckers.

23:27.423 --> 23:29.420
If I have to piss my pants.

23:29.420 --> 23:32.070
Come on, let's get lucky
and find these fuckers here.

23:42.780 --> 23:44.872
- We're literally a minute out.

23:44.872 --> 23:46.894
- [Ben] Come on, let's
get these in the bag.

23:46.894 --> 23:47.958
- Could be a goer.

23:47.958 --> 23:49.400
Could be a goer.

23:49.400 --> 23:50.450
This is what we want.

23:51.610 --> 23:53.790
- [Narrator] The hunters are
closing in on the location

23:53.790 --> 23:55.430
of Frank and Harry's meet

23:55.430 --> 23:56.683
with their sister Lizzie.

24:00.210 --> 24:01.577
- Liz.
- Love you, yeah.

24:01.577 --> 24:02.815
Love ya, cheers.

24:02.815 --> 24:04.150
- Right, love you.

24:04.150 --> 24:07.143
Next time you see us we'll
be winners hopefully.

24:11.601 --> 24:13.030
- It's off this roundabout
the burger van, is it?

24:13.030 --> 24:14.033
Yeah, it is, yeah.

24:14.033 --> 24:15.330
- [Dan] Roundabout.

24:15.330 --> 24:16.257
- Come on.

24:16.257 --> 24:18.984
Did you get eyes on at all, Dan?

24:18.984 --> 24:20.117
- [Jordan] We missed 'em.

24:20.117 --> 24:22.253
- [Dan] Oh fuck.

24:24.685 --> 24:25.518
Shit.

24:27.312 --> 24:29.066
- Just wondering if you
could help us at all please.

24:29.066 --> 24:29.899
- Yep.

24:29.899 --> 24:31.670
- We're lookin' for two individuals.

24:31.670 --> 24:34.448
I wondered if you'd seen 'em in this area.

24:34.448 --> 24:35.660
- That's a regular.

24:35.660 --> 24:36.493
- [Jordan] A regular is it?

24:36.493 --> 24:37.326
- Yeah.

24:37.326 --> 24:38.263
- Frank Savage is a regular here?

24:38.263 --> 24:39.990
- [Blonde Cook] They were over there.

24:39.990 --> 24:41.140
- [Jordan] Fuck's sake.

24:42.277 --> 24:44.547
- [Dan] How long do you
reckon you were there for?

24:44.547 --> 24:48.948
- I don't know, we were
pretty busy so I'm not sure.

24:48.948 --> 24:51.523
- [Jordan] Guttered,
they were parked there.

24:51.523 --> 24:53.025
- That's really annoyin' innit?

24:53.025 --> 24:55.275
- Done my nut in, that has.

24:56.213 --> 24:57.505
- We did it.

24:57.505 --> 24:58.731
- [Frank] They didn't find us.

24:58.731 --> 25:00.513
Let's get out of here.

25:00.513 --> 25:01.346
We can do this, Haz.

25:01.346 --> 25:02.295
- [Harry] Yeah, we can do it.

25:02.295 --> 25:03.712
- We can do this.

25:05.198 --> 25:06.825
Yeah, I feel emotional seein'
her, that's mad, innit?

25:06.825 --> 25:08.242
- [Harry] I know.

25:09.786 --> 25:11.047
- Don't, you'll make me cry.

25:11.047 --> 25:12.843
Yeah, I know, I don't cry either.

25:12.843 --> 25:13.866
That's the worst thing.

25:13.866 --> 25:14.848
I've cried more in fuckin' this

25:14.848 --> 25:17.015
than I have anything else.

25:18.867 --> 25:19.980
- [Bearded Analyst] This
handset hasn't checked in again.

25:19.980 --> 25:20.813
What's goin' on?

25:21.980 --> 25:25.030
- It's all gone quite
and I'm not very happy.

25:25.030 --> 25:27.090
- I'm gonna say it's been turned off.

25:27.090 --> 25:28.907
So we can't track the phone.

25:33.887 --> 25:35.062
- Matt, love ya, yeah?

25:35.062 --> 25:35.910
- Love you, love you, love you.

25:35.910 --> 25:36.743
- You happy to see us.

25:36.743 --> 25:37.576
- You got this, right?

25:37.576 --> 25:38.409
- Yeah, thank you.

25:38.409 --> 25:39.242
- I love you so much.

25:39.242 --> 25:42.570
You've got this, nine days,
boys, keep it strong, yeah?

25:42.570 --> 25:44.460
- Seeing Lizzie was great.

25:44.460 --> 25:45.580
I don't tell my sister enough

25:45.580 --> 25:48.093
that I appreciate her and
I don't thank her enough.

25:49.310 --> 25:51.750
For like everything so, you know,

25:51.750 --> 25:53.594
it was good to see her.

25:53.594 --> 25:57.445
I am really hoping that we are
gonna poo in their biscuits

25:57.445 --> 25:59.830
and make it to the end
without them knowin'.

26:02.779 --> 26:05.150
- [Peter] Okay, ladies
and gentleman, Matt Mason.

26:05.150 --> 26:06.840
Where are we at with him?

26:06.840 --> 26:08.330
- Lookin' at those southbound movements,

26:08.330 --> 26:10.860
we started all the way up
here, all the way down.

26:10.860 --> 26:14.520
The continuation would be
to home address down here.

26:14.520 --> 26:15.920
Perhaps to Barnstaple.

26:15.920 --> 26:17.850
- Puts you onto Dartmoor
which is his backyard.

26:17.850 --> 26:18.683
His training area and.

26:18.683 --> 26:21.270
- Yeah, so we get out
quickly, hide quickly.

26:21.270 --> 26:22.280
- Makes sense.

26:22.280 --> 26:23.113
We need to catch him

26:23.113 --> 26:25.800
before he gets too close towards Dartmoor.

26:25.800 --> 26:29.043
- If we get any technical data
to say he's in a certain area

26:29.043 --> 26:31.230
then we will cross that marine network

26:31.230 --> 26:33.177
'cause undoubtedly, it's
gonna be a fellow marine

26:33.177 --> 26:34.460
that's helpin' him.

26:34.460 --> 26:37.390
The longer this goes on, the
more comfortable he feels,

26:37.390 --> 26:38.760
the more arrogant he'll become.

26:38.760 --> 26:40.500
I'm kind of hoping that's the case.

26:40.500 --> 26:44.193
And his pride will let him
make a mistake, definitely.

26:45.739 --> 26:47.028
(electronic beeping)

26:47.028 --> 26:49.861
(seagulls cawing)

26:50.740 --> 26:52.160
- So if you just pop
in front of that there

26:52.160 --> 26:52.993
and I'll jump out there.

26:53.860 --> 26:55.840
- [Narrator] After successfully
evading the hunters

26:55.840 --> 26:57.490
to meet his wife in Gloucestershire.

26:57.490 --> 26:59.760
- All right, brilliant,
yeah, cheers, thank you.

26:59.760 --> 27:02.140
- [Narrator] Royal Marine Matt
Mason has been given a lift

27:02.140 --> 27:04.690
by his friend Rob Stacy to a car park

27:04.690 --> 27:06.143
near his home in Devon.

27:08.248 --> 27:10.640
- You know, I feel so at
ease here, it's unbelievable.

27:10.640 --> 27:11.880
You know, it's almost like I don't feel

27:11.880 --> 27:12.980
like I'm bein' hunted.

27:14.759 --> 27:16.022
(Matt whistling)

27:16.022 --> 27:18.605
(gate squeaks)

27:22.845 --> 27:24.574
(suspenseful music)

27:24.574 --> 27:25.850
I joined the Royal Marines in 2007.

27:25.850 --> 27:27.385
Since then I've done three
tours of Afghanistan,

27:27.385 --> 27:29.830
counter piracy, counter
narcotic operations

27:29.830 --> 27:31.640
in the Arabian Gulf.

27:31.640 --> 27:34.700
I find every day life pretty
monotonous to be honest.

27:34.700 --> 27:36.940
I think once you've done
things that you can do

27:36.940 --> 27:39.680
in the military, to
come back to normal life

27:39.680 --> 27:41.110
is really, really tough

27:41.110 --> 27:43.550
so I enjoy bein' in dangerous situations

27:43.550 --> 27:45.220
because it makes me feel alive,

27:45.220 --> 27:46.550
it keeps my heart tickin'.

27:47.520 --> 27:50.550
The experiences that I've had will give me

27:50.550 --> 27:54.230
a large tactical advantage
over the hunters.

27:54.230 --> 27:57.453
Plan for today is to ambush the hunters.

27:58.300 --> 28:01.929
And then try and let all their tires down

28:01.929 --> 28:05.050
and put some pretty unsavory
stuff on their vehicles.

28:05.050 --> 28:08.013
I'm tryin' to piss the
hunters off as much as I can.

28:09.788 --> 28:11.260
Being a serving Royal Marine, fightin'

28:11.260 --> 28:12.760
is the only way forward from now on

28:12.760 --> 28:16.543
so today we're gonna leave
'em bruised and red faced.

28:19.070 --> 28:21.460
- We've really started to
drill down into the vehicles

28:21.460 --> 28:22.970
that have left the target area

28:22.970 --> 28:26.592
and then back towards South Devon.

28:26.592 --> 28:29.060
- So that's every single
vehicle that passed the camera

28:29.060 --> 28:30.270
on the M-5 heading south.

28:30.270 --> 28:31.543
And we zoom in.

28:32.380 --> 28:33.870
That's a hell of a lot of vehicles

28:33.870 --> 28:37.460
and then these ones are every
vehicle that hit ANPR camera

28:37.460 --> 28:40.790
on the A-361 nearest
to Matt's home address

28:40.790 --> 28:41.960
and then that is the vehicles

28:41.960 --> 28:43.610
that hit both of those cameras.

28:43.610 --> 28:46.883
In theory, one of these
license plates is our vehicle.

28:48.460 --> 28:50.800
- [Narrator] HQ have analyzed all vehicles

28:50.800 --> 28:54.162
that hit ANPR cameras in
both Matt's last location

28:54.162 --> 28:56.650
and close to his home address.

28:56.650 --> 28:59.393
They've identified approximately 30 cars.

29:00.530 --> 29:02.870
By cross referencing all owner details

29:02.870 --> 29:05.340
with Matt's known associates, one vehicle

29:05.340 --> 29:07.053
is of particular interest.

29:08.140 --> 29:11.100
- We've had a detail for
the owner of the Audi.

29:11.100 --> 29:13.037
It's a Robert Stacy.

29:13.037 --> 29:15.670
- [Zoe] He's a close
associate of Duncan Thompson,

29:15.670 --> 29:17.410
Rachel Cox's partner.

29:17.410 --> 29:18.550
- All right, we need
to know where he went.

29:18.550 --> 29:22.410
Can we get his phone and track
his phone durin' that journey

29:22.410 --> 29:24.200
and get, triangulate the last ping

29:24.200 --> 29:26.598
on his phone at the bottom of that route?

29:26.598 --> 29:27.770
- [Bearded Analyst] Awesome.

29:27.770 --> 29:29.320
- [Brunette Analyst] We're
gonna get exact drop off.

29:29.320 --> 29:30.153
- Yeah.

29:30.153 --> 29:31.120
- [Brunette Analyst] Sweet.

29:31.120 --> 29:32.950
- [Blonde Analyst] One of
them's right next to his house.

29:32.950 --> 29:34.483
- Oh great.

29:34.483 --> 29:36.110
- They're all going home.

29:36.110 --> 29:38.530
- They cannot resist the lure of home,

29:38.530 --> 29:40.740
familiar territory, can they?

29:42.142 --> 29:43.990
- Hi ladies, I think we'll
get you guys headed down

29:43.990 --> 29:46.940
towards the last location
where we believe Mason was

29:46.940 --> 29:48.030
near the home address.

29:48.030 --> 29:49.560
Obviously his missus is down there,

29:49.560 --> 29:51.830
the kid's down there,
he's got a massive network

29:51.830 --> 29:53.610
of commandos down there.

29:53.610 --> 29:54.443
- Perfect.

29:54.443 --> 29:55.863
Oh, I can't wait for this.

29:58.770 --> 30:00.670
- [Ben] He's gonna have
a lot of military friends

30:00.670 --> 30:01.760
that are gonna help him.

30:01.760 --> 30:02.593
- Yep.

30:02.593 --> 30:04.890
- Like minded, physically fit, resourceful

30:04.890 --> 30:05.760
and up for the challenge

30:05.760 --> 30:08.310
so I think we need to build
upon that military network

30:08.310 --> 30:10.989
and try and work out
who's gonna help Mason

30:10.989 --> 30:12.089
while he's on the run.

30:16.425 --> 30:17.642
- We just fell into a bit of (mumbles).

30:17.642 --> 30:18.640
I'm gonna try and hook
up with the chairman

30:18.640 --> 30:21.570
of the North Devon Royal
Marines Association.

30:21.570 --> 30:24.730
He's a man with many connections.

30:24.730 --> 30:25.730
I just hope he's in.

30:27.530 --> 30:29.060
This one.

30:29.060 --> 30:30.220
John?

30:30.220 --> 30:31.053
- [John] Hello.

30:31.053 --> 30:31.886
- Hello, it's Matt.

30:31.886 --> 30:33.200
Mate, I'm right glad to see you.

30:33.200 --> 30:35.003
No one's been round have they?

30:35.003 --> 30:35.836
- No, no.

30:35.836 --> 30:37.000
- [Jenny] How are you doing?

30:37.000 --> 30:38.511
- I'm all right, I'm still on the run.

30:38.511 --> 30:39.830
- [Jenny] Are you?

30:39.830 --> 30:40.663
- That's my daughter.

30:40.663 --> 30:41.797
- How are you doing, you all right?

30:41.797 --> 30:42.630
- Hi, nice to meet you.

30:42.630 --> 30:43.463
- Sorry, I didn't catch your name.

30:43.463 --> 30:44.296
- Jenny.
- Jenny.

30:44.296 --> 30:45.129
- Jenny, how you doin' I'm Matt.

30:45.129 --> 30:45.962
- Hello, nice to meet you.

30:45.962 --> 30:46.795
- Nice to meet ya.

30:46.795 --> 30:47.737
I've come round here
to see if you can come

30:47.737 --> 30:50.275
and give us an hand
and ambush the hunters.

30:50.275 --> 30:51.108
- Yeah, yeah.

30:51.108 --> 30:51.941
- Yeah, that'd be great.

30:51.941 --> 30:52.774
Do you know Saunton Sands?
- Yeah.

30:52.774 --> 30:55.039
- I wanna lure 'em to the car park,

30:55.039 --> 30:57.540
get my missus to walk along the beach

30:57.540 --> 31:00.460
then just sort of let
all their tires down.

31:00.460 --> 31:01.824
- You don't wanna get caught though.

31:01.824 --> 31:02.657
- No, no.

31:03.586 --> 31:05.807
- So if you wanna write down everythin'

31:05.807 --> 31:07.670
and we'll leave that securely somewhere

31:07.670 --> 31:09.742
and then Jen'll take you
over to Saunton Sands.

31:09.742 --> 31:10.575
- Awesome.

31:10.575 --> 31:12.940
- No texting, no emailing, no phone call.

31:12.940 --> 31:16.410
Absolutely nada because
there's people chasing Matt.

31:16.410 --> 31:18.550
- The Royal Marines
are like a brotherhood.

31:18.550 --> 31:20.800
Any situation, any time of day,

31:20.800 --> 31:22.940
I can give 'em a call
and they will be there

31:22.940 --> 31:24.180
to gimme a hand.

31:24.180 --> 31:25.130
See later on, mate.

31:26.100 --> 31:27.480
- [Narrator] With John Peele committed

31:27.480 --> 31:28.910
to help with the ambush,

31:28.910 --> 31:31.980
his daughter Jenny drives
Matt back Saunton Sands

31:31.980 --> 31:33.330
so he can prepare.

31:33.330 --> 31:34.871
- Yeah, your dad's an absolute legend

31:34.871 --> 31:35.704
for me givin' me an hand.

31:35.704 --> 31:36.797
- He's not bad is he?

31:38.870 --> 31:40.040
- [Narrator] Matt's plan relies

31:40.040 --> 31:42.990
on the hunters intercepting
a call to his wife's phone

31:42.990 --> 31:44.600
from a local number.

31:44.600 --> 31:46.590
- [Matt] Would you be able
to potentially ring off

31:46.590 --> 31:48.880
someone else's phone like a phone box?

31:48.880 --> 31:50.770
- Yeah, I could do that.

31:50.770 --> 31:52.220
- When they get a phone call sayin'

31:52.220 --> 31:53.870
that I wanna meet my wife,

31:53.870 --> 31:55.187
you know, they're gonna jump on it

31:55.187 --> 31:56.680
and they're gonna send
people to come and get me

31:56.680 --> 31:58.713
and hopefully fall into my little trap.

31:59.690 --> 32:01.540
Right, thank you so much for that.

32:01.540 --> 32:02.711
Yeah, give us an hug.

32:02.711 --> 32:03.544
Thank you, cheers.

32:03.544 --> 32:04.377
- Don't worry, take care.

32:04.377 --> 32:05.340
- Right, nice one, right see ya in a bit.

32:05.340 --> 32:07.198
If anyone asks, you've not seen me.

32:07.198 --> 32:08.865
- [Jenny] Of course.

32:10.480 --> 32:13.840
- I am convinced that Matt is gonna try

32:13.840 --> 32:18.345
and display somehow that he
has greater tactical awareness

32:18.345 --> 32:22.108
than we do so I strongly
suspect at some point

32:22.108 --> 32:25.230
he's gonna lay a trap that
he wants us to fall into

32:25.230 --> 32:29.060
whilst he is a mile up
the road going ha, ha, ha.

32:29.060 --> 32:29.893
- [Ben] Yeah, absolutely right.

32:29.893 --> 32:31.080
- Who's the clever one.

32:31.080 --> 32:33.080
- He might even have an air of arrogance

32:33.080 --> 32:35.320
about his plan just because he's very good

32:35.320 --> 32:37.760
at what he does and served in the military

32:37.760 --> 32:38.944
at a high level.

32:38.944 --> 32:41.094
Doesn't mean he's any
better than the rest.

32:42.280 --> 32:44.863
(upbeat music)

32:47.038 --> 32:48.510
- That was so lucky that I see you.

32:48.510 --> 32:51.160
I was like seconds from
just havin' a breakdown.

32:51.160 --> 32:54.442
And then you've really
cheered me up and made my day.

32:54.442 --> 32:57.000
- [Narrator] Loren has
hitchhiked 100 miles south

32:57.000 --> 32:59.640
to Sandbach services in Cheshire.

32:59.640 --> 33:00.473
- Thank you.

33:01.390 --> 33:02.773
Oh me legs.

33:04.370 --> 33:06.510
- [Narrator] She's arranged
to meet her sisters in Derby

33:06.510 --> 33:07.523
in two hours.

33:08.510 --> 33:11.203
But she's still 50 miles
away and needs a lift.

33:12.400 --> 33:15.270
- Kind of exciting,
kind of shittin' myself,

33:15.270 --> 33:18.537
kinda hungry, kind of everythin'.

33:18.537 --> 33:19.370
I can do this.

33:19.370 --> 33:20.770
I'll just ask every single person.

33:20.770 --> 33:22.800
One person is bound to say yeah.

33:22.800 --> 33:24.720
I need to get to Derby like ASAP.

33:24.720 --> 33:26.130
I don't know if there's
any way you can drop me

33:26.130 --> 33:28.024
like a little bit further
like down the line?

33:28.024 --> 33:29.405
- [Woman] That's not the way we're.

33:29.405 --> 33:32.083
- Not the way you're goin',
yeah, no, that's cool.

33:32.083 --> 33:33.167
All right, thank you.

33:33.167 --> 33:34.340
Cheers, thank you very much.

33:34.340 --> 33:35.920
Do you wanna take me to Derby?

33:35.920 --> 33:37.940
- I wish I could, I've got a full car.

33:37.940 --> 33:40.357
The back seats are
down, I'm going campin'.

33:40.357 --> 33:41.890
- Aw, thank you anyway.

33:41.890 --> 33:44.332
Can you take me to Derby please.

33:44.332 --> 33:45.637
- No, I'm not goin' that way.

33:45.637 --> 33:47.338
- [Loren] No!

33:47.338 --> 33:48.866
- [Man] Good luck.

33:48.866 --> 33:51.504
- I'd have better luck
if you gimme a lift.

33:51.504 --> 33:53.600
Oh, I'm gettin' so stressed.

33:53.600 --> 33:58.320
Excuse me, this is really random
but I need to get to Derby

33:58.320 --> 33:59.380
or anywhere closer to Derby

33:59.380 --> 34:02.290
is there any way that I
could catch a lift with you?

34:02.290 --> 34:03.123
- [Richard] Yeah.

34:03.123 --> 34:03.956
- Shut up.

34:03.956 --> 34:05.392
Oh I love you so much!

34:05.392 --> 34:06.620
Thank you, I've asked like 100 people.

34:06.620 --> 34:08.413
Thank you so much, you're a legend.

34:09.400 --> 34:11.813
Okay, it's called Kiwi Park.

34:12.820 --> 34:14.170
Thank you.

34:14.170 --> 34:15.600
Oh I can't believe it.

34:15.600 --> 34:16.733
So happy.

34:17.670 --> 34:18.680
What's your name?

34:18.680 --> 34:19.513
- Richard.

34:19.513 --> 34:21.060
- Richard, I'm Loren, nice to meet you.

34:25.940 --> 34:28.500
- [Woman On Phone] It
was on Sandbach services.

34:28.500 --> 34:30.367
- Sandbach services.

34:30.367 --> 34:31.973
- [Woman On Phone] She
wanted to get to Derby

34:31.973 --> 34:34.866
within an hour or something.

34:34.866 --> 34:37.340
- [Narrator] Having launched
a social media campaign,

34:37.340 --> 34:40.470
HQ's received a call from
a member of the public.

34:40.470 --> 34:44.160
- [Woman On Phone] And she was
blonde, about five foot five.

34:44.160 --> 34:45.640
- Can we pore over that site.

34:45.640 --> 34:47.490
There must be cameras on the carpark.

34:51.818 --> 34:54.294
- Gettin' like nervous as we get closer.

34:54.294 --> 34:56.260
Maybe like if they've seen me on CCTV.

34:56.260 --> 34:58.482
Do cameras have face recognition?

34:58.482 --> 35:00.090
- Yeah, I guess some of them, yeah.

35:00.090 --> 35:01.380
- I don't even wanna think about it

35:01.380 --> 35:03.080
'cause it really makes me nervous.

35:05.540 --> 35:08.950
- CCTV request at Sandbach
services looking for Loren.

35:08.950 --> 35:09.783
- Oh yes.

35:09.783 --> 35:10.760
- Come back positive.

35:10.760 --> 35:12.540
- [Zoe] There she is, yeah there she is.

35:12.540 --> 35:13.800
Big rucksack.

35:13.800 --> 35:17.330
- [Blonde Woman] It's like the
most obvious place to stand.

35:17.330 --> 35:18.660
Like, right in front of it.

35:18.660 --> 35:21.234
- She's probably thought
services, motor car,

35:21.234 --> 35:23.243
someone'll help me.

35:23.243 --> 35:24.076
- [Zoe] She doesn't look
like she really knows

35:24.076 --> 35:25.770
where to go or what to do.

35:25.770 --> 35:27.450
- This closes the gap significantly.

35:27.450 --> 35:28.650
- [Ben] Massively, yeah.

35:33.450 --> 35:36.806
- Thank you so much, you're the best.

35:36.806 --> 35:40.411
I wanna cry 'cause I feel so nervous.

35:40.411 --> 35:41.790
- [Narrator] Hoping
that a chain of messages

35:41.790 --> 35:44.620
has reached her sisters,
Loren is dropped off

35:44.620 --> 35:46.763
at Kiwi Park in Derby for the rendezvous.

35:48.430 --> 35:51.213
- Every person I see, I'm shitting myself.

35:53.120 --> 35:56.560
I really miss them and I feel
like I've been doin' so well

35:56.560 --> 35:58.240
up until now and in the
last couple of days,

35:58.240 --> 36:00.090
I've just felt really like worn down.

36:04.661 --> 36:07.420
Now, aw, I got so excited then.

36:07.420 --> 36:09.420
Really, really wanna see 'em.

36:09.420 --> 36:10.763
Really wanna see 'em.

36:12.620 --> 36:14.840
I am gonna lose my shit.

36:14.840 --> 36:17.245
I don't think they're comin'.

36:17.245 --> 36:18.983
(mumbles) out of bloody Derby.

36:20.890 --> 36:22.513
And it looks like a shitter.

36:24.630 --> 36:27.104
- The person that gave us this information

36:27.104 --> 36:29.500
said that she wanted
to head further south,

36:29.500 --> 36:31.020
she was looking for a lift.

36:31.020 --> 36:32.870
- I mean, her general movements

36:32.870 --> 36:35.060
has been generally south for a while.

36:35.060 --> 36:36.620
From Scotland, Sandbach.

36:36.620 --> 36:38.080
- [Zoe] Maybe she wants to come home.

36:38.080 --> 36:42.193
- Yeah, I think she's
hungry, disorientated, tired.

36:43.500 --> 36:45.792
We'd be doin' her a favor when
we catch her, wouldn't we?

36:45.792 --> 36:48.342
- Everyone wants to come
back to Essex, don't they?

36:54.084 --> 36:56.866
- My legs are fucking killing me.

36:56.866 --> 36:58.366
Fuck's sake, I'm sittin' down.

37:00.524 --> 37:03.833
I'm just tired and I feel
like I've come all this way.

37:03.833 --> 37:04.666
Didn't even get to see 'em

37:04.666 --> 37:06.290
and I'm in the middle of nowhere.

37:09.840 --> 37:11.400
Just so tired.

37:11.400 --> 37:12.973
My whole body aches.

37:13.840 --> 37:16.350
Literally like haven't got
anyone that I can ring to help me

37:16.350 --> 37:18.350
or like anyone to talk to.

37:20.403 --> 37:24.895
I was really lookin' forward
to seein' my sisters as well.

37:24.895 --> 37:27.490
I don't know how my mum is.

37:27.490 --> 37:30.907
I just feel like, I feel lost and lonely.

37:39.710 --> 37:42.543
(seagulls cawing)

37:45.273 --> 37:47.890
- Such a risky maneuver
when I'm, you know,

37:47.890 --> 37:50.950
literally gonna be 50 meters
away from where they pull up.

37:50.950 --> 37:52.947
I don't know how many
hunters are gonna turn up

37:52.947 --> 37:54.770
and I don't know if whilst, you know,

37:54.770 --> 37:56.563
lettin' the tires down

37:56.563 --> 37:58.800
they're gonna come round the
corner and kick me head in.

37:59.676 --> 38:01.176
But it's excitin'.

38:02.200 --> 38:04.200
- [Narrator] In Saunton Sands, Matt's plan

38:04.200 --> 38:07.260
to ambush the hunters
is being put in motion.

38:07.260 --> 38:10.400
- Well, that call'll be
goin' in around about now.

38:10.400 --> 38:11.730
- [Narrator] Associate Jenny Peele

38:11.730 --> 38:14.430
is calling Matt's wife
Lindsay to lure the hunters

38:14.430 --> 38:17.620
to the carpark where the
ambush will take place.

38:17.620 --> 38:19.400
- Hi, Lindsay, you don't know me.

38:19.400 --> 38:22.840
I met Matt and he
desperately wants to see you

38:22.840 --> 38:26.200
at the place where her
nearly broke his leg.

38:26.200 --> 38:27.550
Is that all right, Lindsay?

38:28.410 --> 38:31.000
- It's just basically a trigger for them

38:31.000 --> 38:34.210
to put a tail on my wife and
hopefully she'll lead 'em here

38:34.210 --> 38:36.360
and job's a good 'un.

38:38.400 --> 38:41.890
- We've just had a live update
for Lindsay Mason's phone.

38:41.890 --> 38:46.890
There was an incoming call
from landline at 15:01 today.

38:48.050 --> 38:50.610
That's Bideford area.

38:50.610 --> 38:51.610
Which is interesting.

38:51.610 --> 38:54.090
- That's where he was
dropped off in the Audi.

38:54.090 --> 38:55.510
Wonder if he's still there.

38:55.510 --> 38:57.958
- [Zoe] He'll have tons of
contacts down there, won't he?

38:57.958 --> 38:59.040
- We've gotta be able to
cross that marine network.

38:59.040 --> 39:02.450
In north Devon is our
undoubtedly, it's gonna be one,

39:02.450 --> 39:04.400
a fellow marine who's helpin' him.

39:04.400 --> 39:07.033
- This is how Matt Mason will fall.

39:10.050 --> 39:11.833
- John, legend.

39:12.813 --> 39:13.646
How we doing?

39:14.910 --> 39:16.910
- [Narrator] Ex-marine
John Peele has arrived

39:16.910 --> 39:18.723
to help execute Matt's plan.

39:19.867 --> 39:21.050
- Good to see ya, mate.

39:21.050 --> 39:23.122
John is gonna act as a lookout.

39:23.122 --> 39:24.520
To get a bloke that's
just gonna drop everything

39:24.520 --> 39:26.790
and come give me a hand is amazing

39:27.639 --> 39:28.472
and it just makes things,

39:28.472 --> 39:29.813
it just makes life a bit easier.

39:30.752 --> 39:31.890
So I wanna be here, mate.

39:31.890 --> 39:33.250
So I see my missus come down.

39:33.250 --> 39:34.190
When I see her comin' down there,

39:34.190 --> 39:36.548
I'll just give you a quick
whistle like a (whistles)

39:36.548 --> 39:37.420
sort of thing.

39:37.420 --> 39:39.140
And as soon as the hunters
have followed Lindsay

39:39.140 --> 39:41.310
onto the beach, that is
when I will drop down

39:41.310 --> 39:43.560
and start lettin' their tires down.

39:43.560 --> 39:45.110
- And what time are you expecting?

39:45.110 --> 39:47.567
- 17:30, my missus

39:47.567 --> 39:49.217
and she should arrive on the dot.

39:50.319 --> 39:51.318
Bein' in the military,

39:51.318 --> 39:52.710
when you're on live
operations in Afghanistan,

39:52.710 --> 39:54.610
you never switch off,
you're constantly on it,

39:54.610 --> 39:56.830
you're goin' on patrol, day in day out,

39:56.830 --> 39:58.970
and I think havin' that background,

39:58.970 --> 40:02.130
havin' that experience that
I will have the upper hand.

40:04.320 --> 40:05.890
- [Narrator] The hunters are investigating

40:05.890 --> 40:09.270
Matt's marine associates
in the Bideford area.

40:09.270 --> 40:11.900
By cross checking all
contacts on his phone,

40:11.900 --> 40:14.310
they discover a person of interest.

40:14.310 --> 40:16.437
- John Peele from the Marine Network.

40:16.437 --> 40:19.189
- [Woman Wearing Headscarf]
Number's saved on Mason's phone.

40:19.189 --> 40:21.189
- So John Peele lives in Bideford.

40:21.189 --> 40:22.600
Is he a serving marine?

40:22.600 --> 40:25.510
- He's part of the North Devon
Royal Marines Association.

40:25.510 --> 40:28.712
He seems to do a lot of
work, a lot of fundraising.

40:28.712 --> 40:32.010
- Zoe, we've just had some activity

40:32.010 --> 40:34.110
on the phone of John Peele.

40:34.110 --> 40:35.204
- In where?

40:35.204 --> 40:36.173
- Saunton Sands.

40:36.173 --> 40:37.420
- [Zoe] I'll get CCTV there.

40:37.420 --> 40:38.253
- Yeah.

40:44.584 --> 40:46.648
- That's my wife, that is my wife.

40:46.648 --> 40:49.889
(Matt whistles)

40:49.889 --> 40:51.789
So I've just seen my wife's car comin'

40:52.750 --> 40:54.767
so now we're just waitin'
for the hunters to turn up.

40:54.767 --> 40:56.502
She's parked just below us.

40:56.502 --> 40:57.972
It is pretty intense, isn't it?

40:57.972 --> 40:58.805
It's good fun.

41:00.380 --> 41:01.630
Right, yeah, black Volvo.

41:04.674 --> 41:08.822
I say there's a black Volvo
and there bloody well isn't.

41:08.822 --> 41:09.989
I better move.

41:13.540 --> 41:15.040
So that's my wife's car there.

41:21.595 --> 41:24.370
They might not have
took the bait, you know?

41:24.370 --> 41:25.762
- [Cameraman] What are you thinkin'?

41:25.762 --> 41:27.143
- I'm thinkin' they might
not have took the bait.

41:28.010 --> 41:29.460
Bastards!

41:29.460 --> 41:31.440
If my missus hasn't got
trackers on her car,

41:31.440 --> 41:32.840
she's not brought her phone,

41:34.163 --> 41:35.463
they're probably not gonna turn up.

41:37.110 --> 41:41.120
- All right, guys, we've
got CCTV from Saunton Sands.

41:41.120 --> 41:43.000
Matt has been seen.

41:43.000 --> 41:43.833
- [Peter] He's on the beach

41:43.833 --> 41:45.830
he thinks he's on bloody holiday.

41:45.830 --> 41:47.149
- [Zoe] You're kidding me.

41:47.149 --> 41:47.982
- I can't believe it.

41:47.982 --> 41:51.073
- So you've got Peele's handset,
is that near where that is?

41:51.073 --> 41:52.220
- [Blonde Woman] It's just slightly north.

41:52.220 --> 41:54.103
- So he's with Peele.

41:55.945 --> 41:57.993
This is absolutely gold dust.

41:59.160 --> 41:59.993
Yes!

42:01.087 --> 42:01.920
Gonna get Mason!

42:03.410 --> 42:05.510
We can now plan ahead
and get in front of him

42:05.510 --> 42:07.040
and get him to come to us.

42:07.040 --> 42:08.290
Not the other way around.

42:09.270 --> 42:10.103
(upbeat music)

42:10.103 --> 42:12.780
- I'm here, come and get me, I'm here.

42:12.780 --> 42:14.730
Do you know what I mean?

42:14.730 --> 42:17.240
This isn't a decoy where I'm runnin' off.

42:17.240 --> 42:18.663
God, these hunters are shit aren't they?

42:18.663 --> 42:20.713
They just can't get their staff nowadays.

42:24.000 --> 42:25.203
Bloody all excited.

42:26.820 --> 42:29.480
Been sittin' up here
all day waitin' for 'em.

42:29.480 --> 42:30.430
Don't even turn up.

42:34.087 --> 42:35.460
I can't believe that mate.

42:35.460 --> 42:37.173
I honestly can't believe that.

42:37.173 --> 42:39.040
So, new plan, if I stay at yours tonight,

42:39.040 --> 42:40.601
are you happy with that?

42:40.601 --> 42:41.999
- Yeah.

42:41.999 --> 42:43.790
- [Matt] I've not had a
shower for three nights.

42:43.790 --> 42:45.210
- Well, we'll let you have that.

42:45.210 --> 42:46.210
- [Matt] Oh, superb.

42:47.620 --> 42:49.110
- John Peele's home address, there.

42:49.110 --> 42:51.625
This is where we've had the
positive sightings on CCTV

42:51.625 --> 42:54.370
and then John Peele's phone pinged there.

42:54.370 --> 42:56.124
To get back it would take him 40 minutes

42:56.124 --> 42:57.560
and he has to come through this route.

42:57.560 --> 42:58.530
- Peele's home address.

42:58.530 --> 43:00.220
Well, get to it, crash it.

43:00.220 --> 43:01.136
- Yeah.

43:01.136 --> 43:02.469
- Get him on it.

43:04.309 --> 43:06.735
- Girls, if I give you Peele's address

43:06.735 --> 43:08.175
can you walk past the address

43:08.175 --> 43:09.940
and just see if that car is back?

43:09.940 --> 43:12.148
- Right, good, good, okay.

43:12.148 --> 43:14.420
It's just us girl, the A team.

43:14.420 --> 43:16.320
Look out, Cagney and Lacey are comin'.

43:18.224 --> 43:19.280
- They're only five miles away.

43:19.280 --> 43:21.712
- Let's see what Claire sees

43:21.712 --> 43:23.939
when she gets there.

43:23.939 --> 43:26.939
(suspenseful music)

43:30.320 --> 43:32.290
- We're still keepin'
out eyes out obviously

43:32.290 --> 43:33.730
for oncoming traffic and traffic behind us

43:33.730 --> 43:38.220
but how would they know I'd
been in contact with John?

43:38.220 --> 43:40.860
How would they know how to follow John?

43:40.860 --> 43:43.000
That would simply be a hunch.

43:43.000 --> 43:44.923
- Well, they didn't follow me there

43:44.923 --> 43:48.633
'cause I watched the, what was with me.

43:54.883 --> 43:59.883
- We've just an ANPR hit through
for John Peele's vehicle.

44:00.750 --> 44:01.663
Two minutes ago.

44:02.630 --> 44:04.977
It's heading back along the 361.

44:04.977 --> 44:06.129
- Heading home.

44:06.129 --> 44:07.175
- That'd be nice.

44:07.175 --> 44:08.215
Isn't that silly?

44:08.215 --> 44:09.048
Dunno.

44:09.048 --> 44:10.160
- He assumes that we don't
know who John Peele is.

44:10.160 --> 44:12.580
- Right, we have to get him today.

44:12.580 --> 44:14.140
Like out of all of them, he's the one

44:14.140 --> 44:15.690
that's kinda got under my skin.

44:18.220 --> 44:19.053
- Hello?

44:19.053 --> 44:19.886
- Urgent update.

44:19.886 --> 44:21.920
That vehicle, John Peele's Vauxhall

44:21.920 --> 44:23.818
is, we just had an ANPR hit.

44:23.818 --> 44:25.020
It looks like he's heading home.

44:25.020 --> 44:25.853
- [Lacey] Yep, yep.

44:25.853 --> 44:27.583
- It'd be perfect if you and Claire

44:27.583 --> 44:28.416
are lyin' in wait.

44:28.416 --> 44:30.580
- I'm gonna get out on
foot and position myself.

44:30.580 --> 44:31.830
We'll be, we'll cover the front

44:31.830 --> 44:33.370
and the rear of the property.

44:33.370 --> 44:34.670
- All right, bye, bye bye.

44:35.615 --> 44:39.900
- Fucking yes, we're gonna
get him, we're gonna get him.

44:39.900 --> 44:41.160
- You know I've visited my wife

44:41.160 --> 44:44.023
when they thought I was
in Berkeley and I was.

44:45.044 --> 44:47.510
I've sent them an intercept opportunity

44:47.510 --> 44:49.700
that I was in Saunton Sands and I was.

44:49.700 --> 44:51.293
It wasn't a decoy, I was there.

44:51.293 --> 44:53.570
I could probably send
them exact coordinates

44:53.570 --> 44:55.050
of where I'm gonna be
sleepin' tomorrow night,

44:55.050 --> 44:56.463
they're probably not gonna turn up.

44:57.890 --> 45:00.760
- See, the beauty of it is
Matt Mason doesn't think

45:00.760 --> 45:03.610
for a moment that we're
across any of this part

45:03.610 --> 45:04.720
of his network.

45:04.720 --> 45:05.553
- And he certainly don't know

45:05.553 --> 45:07.213
that we'll have a hunter
team waitin' for him

45:07.213 --> 45:09.310
at Peele's address if he goes back there.

45:09.310 --> 45:10.350
- No.

45:10.350 --> 45:11.250
- He's coming to us,

45:11.250 --> 45:14.180
that's exactly what we wanted
for this whole process.

45:14.180 --> 45:15.130
- [Blonde Analyst] Chief.

45:15.130 --> 45:16.349
- Yep?

45:16.349 --> 45:17.182
- He's 12 minutes out.

45:17.182 --> 45:18.917
Peele's 12 minutes out
from his home address.

45:18.917 --> 45:20.613
- ETA 12 minutes.

45:21.454 --> 45:26.454
- All right, literally got
12 minutes to get up here.

45:26.536 --> 45:27.786
What way is it?

45:28.772 --> 45:30.642
At the end, we need to turn around.

45:30.642 --> 45:33.990
- If he's in Peele's vehicle
towards Peele's home address,

45:33.990 --> 45:37.220
we're gonna catch him.

45:37.220 --> 45:38.723
- [Matt M] Couple of beers, eh John?

45:44.100 --> 45:46.437
- [Lacey] We are outside the property.

45:46.437 --> 45:49.270
- Come on, be in that fucking car.

45:50.361 --> 45:51.272
- We're back in Nottingham.

45:51.272 --> 45:52.551
Apparently we're bein' hunted.

45:52.551 --> 45:55.733
- Guys, Nate's live on Instagram.

45:55.733 --> 45:56.566
- Game on.

45:57.466 --> 45:59.565
- I might actually win this.

45:59.565 --> 46:01.893
I really hope I'm not
about to go get caught.

46:01.893 --> 46:04.078
- They're right on top of her.

46:04.078 --> 46:06.828
(dramatic music)
