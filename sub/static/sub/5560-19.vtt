WEBVTT

00:01.760 --> 00:03.394
(woman) Put the gun down, Bethany.

00:03.396 --> 00:06.596
How are you... You're dead.

00:06.599 --> 00:10.067
I told you I wanted to start over,

00:10.069 --> 00:12.403
to disappear...
and I needed the world...

00:12.405 --> 00:14.905
- You faked your suicide?
- Yes.

00:14.907 --> 00:17.541
And I'm sorry, I can't imagine
what I put you through.

00:17.543 --> 00:20.277
No, you can't.

00:20.279 --> 00:23.681
I was so afraid of someone
finding out what we did,

00:23.683 --> 00:25.483
of losing my freedom.

00:25.485 --> 00:26.984
- I can't...
- Where have you been?

00:26.986 --> 00:31.822
Paraguay, some remote
village outside San Lorenzo.

00:31.824 --> 00:33.157
Why did you come back? Why...

00:33.159 --> 00:34.659
They found me.

00:34.661 --> 00:37.062
Someone knows about Daylight.

00:37.064 --> 00:40.131
They made a play.
I barely escaped with my life.

00:40.133 --> 00:42.858
I need help. I need you and Carter.

00:42.898 --> 00:44.331
Carter is dead.

00:44.333 --> 00:46.566
Oh, God.

00:46.568 --> 00:49.002
They're coming after all of us.

00:49.004 --> 00:50.537
I need new passports.

00:50.539 --> 00:53.907
I need to secure a safe passage
into another country.

00:53.909 --> 00:55.715
- I need...
- Money.

00:56.878 --> 00:59.372
You came back to me
because you need money.

01:00.048 --> 01:02.248
I know you're angry and I know
I've put you through hell,

01:02.250 --> 01:04.044
but look at where we are.

01:04.753 --> 01:08.221
I love you, Bethany, but I had to run.

01:08.223 --> 01:10.890
If you were smart you would do the same.

01:10.892 --> 01:12.258
I don't run.

01:14.562 --> 01:16.563
Well, at least help me then, please.

01:23.638 --> 01:24.671
Hey, Patterson.

01:24.673 --> 01:26.172
You want to play a game?

01:26.174 --> 01:27.240
Love games.

01:27.242 --> 01:28.475
Don't get too excited.

01:28.477 --> 01:29.743
It's not one of your
wizard and elf games

01:29.745 --> 01:31.244
that take four hours to finish.

01:31.246 --> 01:33.580
Well, D&D doesn't ever really finish.

01:33.582 --> 01:34.581
What do these numbers mean to you?

01:34.583 --> 01:37.283
34, 30, 21, 9...

01:37.285 --> 01:38.652
Oh.

01:38.654 --> 01:40.920
- 41, 28...
- Oh! Oh.

01:40.922 --> 01:42.956
- ...13, 7.
- Yes-yes-yes-yes.

01:42.958 --> 01:44.991
I have been obsessed with
these and I haven't been able

01:44.993 --> 01:46.119
to figure this out.

01:46.121 --> 01:48.962
Yeah, I was reading about Levi Hart...

01:48.964 --> 01:51.731
The running back from Hudson
University who got kicked off

01:51.733 --> 01:53.400
the team for drugs...

01:53.402 --> 01:54.460
yesterday.

01:54.736 --> 01:57.604
Anyway, the article lists
the ups and downs

01:57.606 --> 01:59.139
of the football program.

01:59.141 --> 02:02.175
The ups being the last four
national championship wins

02:02.177 --> 02:03.510
and their scores.

02:05.680 --> 02:07.180
34 to 30.

02:07.182 --> 02:08.681
21 to 9.

02:08.684 --> 02:09.983
41 to 28.

02:09.985 --> 02:12.185
13 to 7.

02:12.187 --> 02:13.420
You're like some kind of wizard.

02:13.422 --> 02:14.688
What do we do now, elf?

02:14.690 --> 02:17.090
Actually, I am a gnome cleric.

02:17.092 --> 02:20.427
Now, we just have
to figure out why this tattoo

02:20.429 --> 02:22.462
is pointing to the Hudson
football program.

02:24.632 --> 02:25.733
I thought you hated tea.

02:26.435 --> 02:27.634
Well, it's grown on me.

02:27.636 --> 02:29.169
Glad you came over to my side.

02:29.171 --> 02:31.337
What's with the bowtie, Bill Nye?

02:31.339 --> 02:32.972
Has anybody heard from Weller?

02:32.974 --> 02:33.973
Yeah.

02:33.975 --> 02:35.642
(Weller) Sorry, I'm late.

02:35.644 --> 02:36.976
(Bethany) Go ahead, Patterson.

02:36.978 --> 02:38.945
Okay. Well, first and foremost,

02:38.947 --> 02:40.880
Tasha unlocked a tattoo.

02:42.283 --> 02:43.850
Wow, what have we got?

02:43.852 --> 02:45.885
(Zapata) The last four
championship scores

02:45.887 --> 02:47.821
from Hudson University's football team,

02:47.823 --> 02:50.724
they're on Jane's lower abdomen,
hidden in the fingertips

02:50.726 --> 02:52.058
of the handprint tattoo.

02:52.060 --> 02:53.626
That's different.

02:53.628 --> 02:54.861
What could that be about?

02:54.863 --> 02:56.396
Hudson was under league investigation

02:56.398 --> 02:57.964
last year for scholarship fraud.

02:57.966 --> 02:59.332
A lot of top ranked schools

02:59.334 --> 03:00.734
get investigated... it's pretty common.

03:00.736 --> 03:02.302
A few weeks in, the lead investigator,

03:02.304 --> 03:03.870
Ed Mackey, said he didn't

03:03.872 --> 03:06.339
find any problems with
the scholarship system.

03:06.341 --> 03:10.677
So, six months later, this guy
becomes the VP of a big-time

03:10.679 --> 03:13.747
athletic apparel company,
and now he's being reviewed.

03:13.749 --> 03:15.648
Because the former CEO of said company

03:15.650 --> 03:18.218
is now the current
president of Hudson University,

03:18.220 --> 03:20.186
Karen Morris.

03:20.188 --> 03:22.756
So, the investigator might have
been paid off with a cushy job.

03:22.758 --> 03:24.524
It's no big deal.

03:24.526 --> 03:26.226
Why draw our attention to that?

03:26.228 --> 03:29.095
This clearly points
to Hudson's athletic program.

03:29.097 --> 03:30.830
I know the defensive coordinator
over there,

03:30.832 --> 03:32.098
I went to his camps as a kid.

03:32.100 --> 03:33.500
Would he be willing to talk to us?

03:33.502 --> 03:35.401
I don't see why not. He's a good guy.

03:35.403 --> 03:36.936
He used to give me
rides home from practice

03:36.938 --> 03:38.371
when my mom was running late.

03:38.373 --> 03:39.552
We stayed in touch.

03:39.554 --> 03:41.074
Good, head out.

03:41.076 --> 03:42.505
Let me know what you find.

03:46.547 --> 03:48.414
(distant chatter)

03:50.217 --> 03:51.384
The only thing I'm good for here

03:51.386 --> 03:53.386
is running a lean three-four defense.

03:53.388 --> 03:55.455
I don't have anything to do
with the scholarships.

03:55.457 --> 03:57.257
I know, coach, I just...

03:57.259 --> 03:59.793
We got a tip that there was
something off in the program.

03:59.772 --> 04:01.588
Any idea what that could be about?

04:01.830 --> 04:03.019
Something off?

04:03.598 --> 04:04.764
Were they more specific?

04:04.766 --> 04:06.299
It's hard to explain.

04:06.301 --> 04:08.434
They run a tight ship here, Edgar.

04:08.436 --> 04:10.937
Been investigated a few times,
nothing sticks.

04:10.939 --> 04:13.239
Coach is a good guy, disciplined.

04:13.241 --> 04:15.475
I can't imagine what that
something off might be.

04:15.477 --> 04:16.910
What about this Levi Hart kid?

04:16.911 --> 04:18.310
His story's been all over the news.

04:18.313 --> 04:20.046
Gifted athlete, troubled kid.

04:20.048 --> 04:21.648
Nothing more to it than that.

04:21.649 --> 04:24.017
Karen Morris. I'm the president
of the university.

04:24.019 --> 04:25.518
Would you mind telling me
what this is all about?

04:25.520 --> 04:27.086
Karen, this is Edgar Reade.

04:27.088 --> 04:28.688
He's one of my favorite camp kids.

04:28.690 --> 04:31.024
Still helps out in the summer
when he's not too busy.

04:31.026 --> 04:32.058
Nice to meet you.

04:32.060 --> 04:33.092
It's always a pleasure to meet

04:33.094 --> 04:34.661
one of Coach Jones's protégés,

04:34.663 --> 04:36.930
but this doesn't feel
like a social visit.

04:36.932 --> 04:39.499
Uh, Special Agent Kurt Weller
with the FBI.

04:39.501 --> 04:40.954
And this is my team.

04:40.981 --> 04:42.460
And are you talking to Coach Jones

04:42.437 --> 04:43.870
in any sort of official capacity?

04:43.872 --> 04:45.839
- Yes, but we...
- Then I'm afraid I'm going to

04:45.841 --> 04:47.440
end this conversation immediately.

04:47.442 --> 04:49.142
Please direct any requests
to talk to our personnel

04:49.144 --> 04:50.944
to my office. Let's go.

04:50.946 --> 04:53.515
- Good to see you.
- Good seeing you, coach.

04:53.949 --> 04:56.049
(distant shouting)

04:56.759 --> 04:58.231
They're hiding something, Reade.

04:58.587 --> 05:00.353
Could be, just doesn't
seem tattoo worthy.

05:00.355 --> 05:02.088
Scholarship fraud
isn't that bug of a deal.

05:02.090 --> 05:03.089
Which probably means it's probably more

05:03.091 --> 05:04.669
than scholarship fraud.

05:05.360 --> 05:07.093
(Patterson) Hey, are you guys there?

05:07.095 --> 05:08.962
Patterson. Go.

05:08.964 --> 05:10.137
<i>Any luck?</i>

05:10.799 --> 05:13.800
No, they lawyered up.
Did you find anything?

05:13.802 --> 05:15.869
I looked into terminated <i>scholarships</i>

05:15.871 --> 05:18.104
(radio static) and for any other
information <i>I could get.</i>

05:18.106 --> 05:20.344
And? Patterson?

05:20.842 --> 05:22.375
I lost the comms.

05:22.377 --> 05:23.543
Anyone else got her?

05:23.545 --> 05:24.978
Mm-mm.

05:24.980 --> 05:26.446
We must be in a dead zone.

05:26.448 --> 05:29.182
(distant gunfire)

05:29.184 --> 05:30.383
Run, run!

Lauren.

06:00.791 --> 06:03.282
Just wanted to make sure you
had the opportunity to share

06:03.284 --> 06:04.626
before we wrap things up.

06:05.650 --> 06:06.963
I'm good.

06:06.965 --> 06:09.366
Well, it's customary for people
to share in their first meet.

06:09.368 --> 06:13.387
Customary, but not mandatory, right?

06:13.805 --> 06:15.636
That's right.

06:16.241 --> 06:17.637
I'm good.

06:18.710 --> 06:21.745
Part of being here is admitting
that you're not good.

- The courage...
- Take care, man.

- It's nice meeting you.
- Good luck with everything.

06:39.764 --> 06:40.997

Oh, okay.

I just flip past the point
spreads to get to the stories.

I got you something.

10:55.051 --> 10:56.284
Uh...

10:56.587 --> 10:58.488
I don't like tea.

10:59.424 --> 11:01.390
You're not drinking the right kind.

11:06.396 --> 11:07.763
Oolong.

11:07.765 --> 11:09.832
Chinese for black dragon.

11:11.068 --> 11:12.535
Hmm.

11:12.537 --> 11:14.680
It's pretty amazing.

11:15.736 --> 11:16.848
(Jane chuckles)

11:17.508 --> 11:19.842
I don't think I should
be your handler anymore.

11:21.878 --> 11:22.840
What?

11:24.781 --> 11:26.649
Wh... Why?

11:29.252 --> 11:31.387
No, I... I don't want that...

11:31.389 --> 11:34.155
It's not about what you want.
It's not about what I want.

11:34.992 --> 11:38.394
It's about what's best...
for the mission.

11:44.367 --> 11:46.465
You... you sleep with me and you...

11:46.738 --> 11:48.818
you make me feel...

11:51.775 --> 11:55.367
Do you have any idea how hard
all of this has been for me?

11:56.581 --> 11:59.815
And the second it gets too hard
for you, you just walk away?

11:59.817 --> 12:02.051
- Taylor...
- No, you're a coward.

12:04.454 --> 12:06.455
(phone buzzing)

12:09.826 --> 12:11.260
God, I...

12:11.262 --> 12:13.136
I have to go to my safe house...

12:13.765 --> 12:16.398
'cause they're... packing me up.

12:16.400 --> 12:17.943
But please don't...

12:19.771 --> 12:21.579
Don't disappear on me.

12:22.607 --> 12:25.107
Promise me that we can
talk about this tonight.

12:26.910 --> 12:28.370
You owe me that.

12:34.851 --> 12:36.252
(Weller) All right.

12:36.254 --> 12:37.653
I'll take the upper levels with Jane.

12:37.655 --> 12:39.088
You two, clear this floor.

12:39.090 --> 12:40.623
- All right?
- On it.

12:40.625 --> 12:41.991
Exit through the lobby!

12:41.993 --> 12:44.260
(students screaming)

12:47.497 --> 12:48.597
(Weller) Get out of here.

12:48.599 --> 12:49.865
Go. Get out of here.

12:50.934 --> 12:52.468
Jane, this way.

12:52.470 --> 12:54.503
I think we should split up,
cover more ground.

12:54.505 --> 12:56.172
No, not while our comms are down.

13:01.545 --> 13:03.779
- (shrieking)
- We're FBI. Keep going.

13:03.781 --> 13:05.114
Get out!

13:10.385 --> 13:11.385
Body.

13:16.960 --> 13:19.028
Weller, we need to split up
to cover more ground.

13:22.032 --> 13:24.466
I'll go up and over,
come back down that side,

13:24.468 --> 13:25.501
try and box him in.

13:25.503 --> 13:27.169
All right? Go.

14:18.455 --> 14:19.455
Put it down!

14:21.758 --> 14:22.858
I'm not the shooter.

14:22.860 --> 14:25.194
- I'm...
- Drop the weapon!

14:25.196 --> 14:27.229
(man on PA) <i>This
is an emergency announcement.</i>

14:27.231 --> 14:29.365
<i>A suspect with a weapon is on campus.</i>

14:29.367 --> 14:32.635
If you can't get to safety,
<i>shelter in place.</i>

14:32.637 --> 14:34.904
<i>Wait for instructions from authorities.</i>

14:34.906 --> 14:37.313
- I said drop it!
- Okay.

14:38.242 --> 14:40.075
I'm gonna put it down.

14:42.746 --> 14:45.314
Don't shoot me, I'm FBI.

14:45.316 --> 14:46.959
You don't look like FBI.

14:47.551 --> 14:48.550
Get your hands up!

14:48.552 --> 14:50.423
My hands are already up.

14:51.122 --> 14:52.488
Calm down.

14:52.490 --> 14:53.511
Turn around.

14:54.325 --> 14:55.658
Do it, now!

14:55.660 --> 14:57.426
You're making a mistake.

14:57.428 --> 14:59.862
- My team...
- Shut up.

14:59.864 --> 15:01.597
Don't shoot me, please.

15:01.599 --> 15:03.479
I'm not going to shoot you.

15:03.668 --> 15:05.267
I told you, I'm FBI.

15:05.269 --> 15:06.435
Okay, I was chasing the gunman.

15:06.437 --> 15:07.569
He went out that door.

15:07.571 --> 15:09.107
We need to work together.

15:10.074 --> 15:11.073
Okay.

15:11.075 --> 15:13.008
- Okay.
- Okay.

15:16.179 --> 15:17.346
We need to move.

15:17.348 --> 15:18.747
Stay close, cover our backs.

15:18.749 --> 15:19.949
Can you handle that?

15:23.286 --> 15:27.156
Don't point it at me, all right?

15:34.264 --> 15:37.666
(distant gunfire)

15:39.336 --> 15:41.837
Sounds like it's
coming from the cafeteria.

15:41.839 --> 15:43.839
(screaming)

15:43.841 --> 15:45.441
- All right, which way?
- Around this corner

15:45.443 --> 15:47.309
and then all the way to the right.

15:53.216 --> 15:55.384
Hey... there's no body.

16:01.691 --> 16:03.192
Behind!

16:07.230 --> 16:08.230
(grunting)

16:10.233 --> 16:12.401
(panting)

16:12.403 --> 16:13.635
She's lost a lot of blood.

16:16.006 --> 16:18.907
All right, take these,
press down really hard.

16:18.909 --> 16:20.642
Okay. You're okay.

16:20.644 --> 16:21.877
It's okay.

16:21.879 --> 16:22.878
There's too much.

16:26.216 --> 16:27.916
Okay.

16:30.520 --> 16:32.054
(metal clanking)

16:34.991 --> 16:36.558
Here.

16:38.528 --> 16:40.162
Okay. This is going to hurt.

16:40.164 --> 16:41.730
I need you to bite down on this.

16:41.732 --> 16:43.565
Okay. Just like that.

16:43.567 --> 16:44.566
Lift her shirt up.

16:46.169 --> 16:47.836
Ready? Ready?

16:49.005 --> 16:51.874
(skin sizzling, woman screaming)

16:51.876 --> 16:53.175
(Jane) Okay. Okay.

16:53.177 --> 16:54.943
That should stop the bleeding for now,

16:54.945 --> 16:56.412
I need you to get her out of here.

16:57.747 --> 17:00.382
(guard speaks indistinctly)

17:00.384 --> 17:03.419
(distant gunfire)

17:17.967 --> 17:19.060
Agh! Uhh!

17:19.061 --> 17:21.069
(gun clatters to ground)

17:22.472 --> 17:24.640
(Zapata grunting)

17:26.643 --> 17:27.843
Thanks.

17:27.845 --> 17:29.845
- You okay?
- (handcuffs snapping)

17:29.847 --> 17:32.147
But the coach needs
medical attention ASAP.

17:32.149 --> 17:34.883
(explosion)

17:37.287 --> 17:38.587
What the hell was that?

17:38.589 --> 17:40.823
You can't hide from this.

17:40.825 --> 17:42.357
You have no idea what's coming.

17:49.062 --> 17:50.995
(heart monitor beeping) _

17:50.997 --> 17:53.992
(labored speech)
I was fine at the hospital.

17:54.600 --> 17:55.861
I know you were.

17:57.831 --> 17:59.504
I want you here...

17:59.941 --> 18:01.105
with family.

18:01.742 --> 18:03.926
I don't want to cramp your style.

18:03.927 --> 18:05.176
(chuckles)

18:05.178 --> 18:08.485
I live with my sister
and her ten-year-old kid.

18:09.693 --> 18:11.588
I think my style is cramped.

18:12.684 --> 18:14.118
I...

18:14.120 --> 18:15.520
You know you...

18:16.306 --> 18:17.789
you don't owe me anything.

18:18.830 --> 18:22.427
The whole town thought I killed her.

18:22.769 --> 18:25.863
I... you were a kid.

18:26.270 --> 18:28.267
I don't blame you.

18:28.742 --> 18:31.470
Dad, we... we don't have to do this now.

18:31.471 --> 18:32.770
(gravelly sigh)

18:32.772 --> 18:34.739
That's my boy.

18:38.565 --> 18:40.878
I'm so... so grateful...

18:41.526 --> 18:43.215
to have you back.

18:43.782 --> 18:46.394
I don't want you carrying
the guilt for the...

18:47.164 --> 18:49.454
those years we missed.

18:49.456 --> 18:51.055
I...

18:51.057 --> 18:52.223
I for...

18:52.225 --> 18:54.225
I forgive you, son.

19:00.858 --> 19:02.092
Body.

19:07.435 --> 19:09.455
Weller, we need to split up
to cover more ground.

19:12.202 --> 19:14.403
I'll go up and over,
come back down that side,

19:14.405 --> 19:15.805
try and box him in.

19:15.808 --> 19:17.750
All right? Go.

19:42.366 --> 19:44.154
- Show me your hands.
- Don't shoot, please!

19:44.179 --> 19:45.402
- Both of them.
- I can't!

19:46.437 --> 19:48.672
- Agh.
- Don't worry, I'm FBI.

19:55.179 --> 19:57.114
Here. Just keep pressure on that.

19:57.116 --> 19:58.215
What happened?

19:58.217 --> 20:00.050
I heard the shots first.

20:00.052 --> 20:03.386
I didn't even know it was a gun
until the kid ran up on me.

20:03.388 --> 20:04.855
This kid. What's he look like?

20:04.857 --> 20:05.856
What's he wearing?

20:05.858 --> 20:08.792
It's Levi Hart.

20:08.794 --> 20:10.393
What?

20:10.395 --> 20:11.528
The player that just got busted?

20:11.530 --> 20:12.796
Yeah.

20:12.798 --> 20:14.297
All right, where'd he go?

20:14.299 --> 20:16.266
Defensive meeting room.

20:16.268 --> 20:18.372
He took my keys.

20:18.971 --> 20:20.637
<i>This is an emergency announcement.</i>

20:20.639 --> 20:23.240
<i>A suspect with a weapon is on campus.</i>

20:23.242 --> 20:25.976
If you can't get to safety,
<i>shelter in place.</i>

20:25.978 --> 20:28.445
<i>Wait for instructions from authorities.</i>

20:30.181 --> 20:33.583
(gunfire, screaming)

20:36.554 --> 20:38.588
Stop. Hey! Stop.

20:38.590 --> 20:40.457
Don't worry, don't worry. Kid, look.

20:40.459 --> 20:42.025
I'm with the FBI. Okay?

20:42.027 --> 20:43.293
I need you to get out of here.

20:43.295 --> 20:44.494
You can't go through that door,

20:44.496 --> 20:46.163
they're rigged with explosives.

20:46.165 --> 20:47.764
I need you to do me a favor.

20:47.766 --> 20:49.432
Go to the end of the hallway
where it's safe.

20:49.434 --> 20:51.134
Stop anyone coming through those doors.

20:51.136 --> 20:52.536
You hear me?

21:13.324 --> 21:15.025
(crash)

21:34.045 --> 21:35.078
Whoa.

22:04.041 --> 22:05.242
(grunts)

22:23.494 --> 22:24.494
(door opening)

22:24.496 --> 22:26.062
Stop! Stop.

22:26.064 --> 22:28.198
FBI, all right.

22:28.200 --> 22:30.100
You can't go this way.
It's too dangerous.

22:30.102 --> 22:31.768
Touch that door it'll explode.

22:31.770 --> 22:33.703
Come with me. All right?

22:33.705 --> 22:35.438
You stay right behind me.

22:39.043 --> 22:40.543
You stay behind me.

22:42.280 --> 22:43.446
Stay there, stay there. Stay!

22:43.448 --> 22:45.048
Stay-stay-stay-stay.

22:50.021 --> 22:52.422
All right, go down those stairs,
get out of this building.

22:52.424 --> 22:53.423
All right?

22:53.425 --> 22:54.858
Quietly.

22:54.860 --> 22:56.626
Quietly.

22:58.562 --> 23:00.964
(loud thumping)

23:06.137 --> 23:07.470
Levi!

23:07.472 --> 23:09.773
(gunfire)

23:17.481 --> 23:18.748
Levi!

23:20.284 --> 23:22.252
This is the FBI!

23:22.254 --> 23:23.653
This whole building's surrounded.

23:23.655 --> 23:25.288
There's nowhere to go!

23:27.825 --> 23:28.825
Levi.

23:31.829 --> 23:32.829
Levi.

23:37.835 --> 23:39.736
Drop your weapon!

23:39.738 --> 23:41.438
Let's walk out of here!

23:41.440 --> 23:43.306
I don't want you to die today!

23:49.213 --> 23:52.048
Good. Come on out,
lay down on the ground.

23:56.053 --> 23:58.088
Drop your weapon!

23:58.090 --> 23:59.956
(explosion)

24:06.364 --> 24:07.697
(ears ringing)

24:07.699 --> 24:09.165
(grunts)

24:12.670 --> 24:14.037
(coughing)

24:16.974 --> 24:18.008
(coughing)

24:29.186 --> 24:30.220
Were you hit?

24:30.222 --> 24:31.821
Not my blood.

24:31.823 --> 24:33.223
Thanks to Jane.

24:33.225 --> 24:34.357
I'm just glad we got him.

24:34.359 --> 24:35.558
One of them.

24:35.560 --> 24:37.060
There's two?

24:37.062 --> 24:39.129
Yeah, the other one's still out there.

24:39.131 --> 24:40.830
Found this on our guy.

24:40.832 --> 24:42.165
It's a jammer.

24:42.167 --> 24:44.701
Great, so we can get
our comms back online.

24:44.703 --> 24:46.803
(keyboard clacking)

24:49.040 --> 24:50.173
(sighing)

24:55.513 --> 24:57.047
Weller's on the line.

24:57.049 --> 24:58.782
There's an active shooter
situation at Hudson.

24:58.784 --> 25:00.817
Started a few minutes ago.

25:00.819 --> 25:02.519
Weller, what's going on?

25:02.521 --> 25:03.920
Got two active shooters on campus.

25:03.922 --> 25:05.221
One's in custody.

25:05.223 --> 25:06.523
(Weller) <i>One's still at large.</i>

25:06.525 --> 25:08.491
Why am I just hearing about this?

25:08.493 --> 25:10.727
<i>They had a jammer that</i>
<i>cut communication lines.</i>

25:10.729 --> 25:12.262
I've regrouped with Tasha and Jane.

25:12.264 --> 25:13.730
<i>What about Reade?</i>

25:13.732 --> 25:15.532
We haven't been able
to make contact with him yet.

25:15.534 --> 25:16.833
We might be an agent down.

25:27.105 --> 25:29.738
A little bulkier than
the last time you came in.

25:29.740 --> 25:31.740
Also I had to take in
the waste half an inch.

25:31.742 --> 25:33.042
Who was she?

25:34.411 --> 25:36.946
Come on, extra time
at the gym getting ripped,

25:36.948 --> 25:38.214
you're not eating.

25:38.216 --> 25:39.465
You going through a breakup?

25:40.025 --> 25:40.850
No.

25:40.852 --> 25:42.952
It's okay, you always bounce back.

25:43.232 --> 25:44.887
New month, new flavor, right?

25:45.195 --> 25:46.523
That's not what
I'm looking for right now.

25:46.524 --> 25:48.057
If that's not what you're looking for,

25:48.059 --> 25:49.291
then maybe you should
start making some changes,

25:49.293 --> 25:50.593
inside and out, you know.

25:50.595 --> 25:52.027
I'm not sure you're the guy

25:52.029 --> 25:54.029
who should be giving me love advice.

25:54.031 --> 25:55.431
You've been coming to me for six years.

25:55.433 --> 25:57.066
Who else in the city knows you better?

25:57.068 --> 25:58.868
Plenty of people
know me better than you.

25:58.870 --> 26:00.369
(laughing) Yeah, sure.

26:01.638 --> 26:02.862
(snaps)

26:03.141 --> 26:04.193
Ah.

26:04.742 --> 26:05.850
Here.

26:06.444 --> 26:07.658
For the new you.

26:08.302 --> 26:09.217
Come on.

26:11.149 --> 26:12.781
Oh, I hate it.

26:12.783 --> 26:14.908
Which is exactly why
you're gonna wear it.

26:15.620 --> 26:17.972
Or else you can stick
with the same ol' same ol'.

26:18.489 --> 26:19.844
Your call.

26:23.660 --> 26:25.094
(Reade) Get to safety, FBI.

26:25.096 --> 26:27.096
- (gunfire, screaming)
- Guys, get to safety.

26:27.098 --> 26:28.464
(Zapata) You need to take your friend
here and exit through the lobby.

26:28.466 --> 26:29.765
Get as far away
from the building as you can.

26:29.767 --> 26:32.801
Go, move. If you can get to safety, go.

26:32.803 --> 26:34.103
Go, keep going!

26:35.238 --> 26:36.672
I'll go this way.

26:36.674 --> 26:37.673
All right.

26:40.744 --> 26:41.844
Hey, FBI, get out of here!

26:41.846 --> 26:43.479
Come on. Go. Move!

26:43.481 --> 26:44.453
Get out of here.

26:48.652 --> 26:50.119
(girl crying)

26:52.856 --> 26:54.243
(girl crying)

27:00.697 --> 27:01.697
You okay?

27:03.397 --> 27:04.417
All right, I'm gonna get you to safety.

27:04.419 --> 27:05.234
Come with me.

27:05.236 --> 27:06.665
(sobbing) I can't.

27:07.538 --> 27:09.512
I won't leave Nick.

27:10.608 --> 27:13.542
- What's your name?
- Va... Valerie.

27:13.544 --> 27:15.377
Hey, Valerie, my name is Edgar.

27:15.379 --> 27:17.012
I'm a special agent with the FBI.

27:17.014 --> 27:18.480
I'm sorry to tell you this,

27:18.482 --> 27:20.416
but there's nothing
we can do for Nick now.

27:20.418 --> 27:22.918
(sobbing) It's my fault.

27:24.055 --> 27:26.155
He was trying to protect me.

27:26.157 --> 27:27.523
I know, I know, Val.

27:27.525 --> 27:29.124
What Nick did for you was really brave,

27:29.126 --> 27:30.392
but right now...

27:32.362 --> 27:34.496
Hey, right now I need you
to be brave, okay?

27:34.498 --> 27:36.699
Once I get you to safety,
I promise I'll come back for him.

27:36.701 --> 27:37.933
All right, come on.

27:40.036 --> 27:41.203
All right.

27:45.475 --> 27:46.933
<i>This is an emergency announcement.</i>

27:46.935 --> 27:47.876
Come on.

27:47.878 --> 27:49.812
<i>A suspect with a weapon is on campus.</i>

27:49.814 --> 27:51.847
If you can't get to safety,
<i>shelter in place.</i>

27:51.849 --> 27:53.382
Come on.

27:53.384 --> 27:55.251
<i>Wait for instructions from authorities.</i>

27:57.487 --> 27:58.554
Guys, wait! Wait!

27:58.556 --> 27:59.688
I'm FBI.

27:59.690 --> 28:02.096
Get behind me. Get behind me!

28:02.560 --> 28:04.827
All right, stay together.

28:07.564 --> 28:09.898
(distant gunfire)

28:09.900 --> 28:12.001
Stay calm. Stay calm.

28:12.003 --> 28:13.235
All right, we got to find another exit.

28:13.237 --> 28:14.903
This way, everybody follow me.

28:14.905 --> 28:16.205
This way!

28:18.008 --> 28:20.009
(clicking, pin drops)

28:21.845 --> 28:23.545
Everybody get back.

28:23.547 --> 28:25.047
(sighs)

28:25.049 --> 28:26.782
I think I just...

28:26.784 --> 28:27.950
triggered a bomb here.

28:27.952 --> 28:29.351
And I don't want anyone to panic.

28:29.353 --> 28:30.552
Everybody, just carefully...

28:30.554 --> 28:32.187
(woman) Oh, my God!

28:32.189 --> 28:34.356
...get to safety.

28:34.358 --> 28:35.357
Go on, Val.

28:35.359 --> 28:36.592
How can I help?

28:39.496 --> 28:41.597
All right, stand back.

28:49.773 --> 28:51.674
It's a pin removal pressure
release switch.

28:51.676 --> 28:54.610
It's like a grenade.
When the handle went down

28:54.612 --> 28:56.779
it ejected the pin, triggering the bomb.

28:56.781 --> 28:57.880
Right now, I'm the only
one I'm the only thing

28:57.882 --> 28:59.381
keeping it from going off.

28:59.383 --> 29:01.250
(crash)

29:01.252 --> 29:02.451
What the hell was that?

29:02.453 --> 29:04.920
Uh, a mini-fridge?

29:08.458 --> 29:10.592
All right, I saw the pin
go down the hallway.

29:10.594 --> 29:12.594
We just need something
small and strong enough

29:12.596 --> 29:14.430
to keep this clip from springing free.

29:14.432 --> 29:15.531
Let me see one of your earrings.

29:18.735 --> 29:20.235
(whispers) Okay.

29:21.971 --> 29:23.706
You know what, it just might
be strong enough to hold.

29:23.708 --> 29:25.040
Might give me a chance to run.

29:25.042 --> 29:26.075
Y-You're sure?

29:26.077 --> 29:27.142
Nope, but...

29:27.144 --> 29:28.944
we're about to find out.

29:28.946 --> 29:30.112
All right.

29:42.926 --> 29:43.992
(Valerie) Will that hold it?

29:43.994 --> 29:45.494
Not for long.

29:45.496 --> 29:47.396
Now, you get really,
really far from here.

29:47.398 --> 29:48.831
All right. Go. Go.

29:48.833 --> 29:50.265
Go!

29:50.267 --> 29:51.567
Far, Val!

29:54.070 --> 29:56.405
(broken glass crunching)

29:56.407 --> 29:58.240
Okay...

30:02.445 --> 30:03.512
Aagh!

30:06.449 --> 30:09.118
(ears ringing)

30:10.854 --> 30:13.522
(coughing)

30:18.428 --> 30:20.429
(grunting)

30:26.569 --> 30:27.930
Get up.

30:28.506 --> 30:29.738
- You're a cop?
- FBI.

30:29.740 --> 30:31.140
- Huh?
- FBI!

30:31.142 --> 30:32.107
Get up.

30:32.109 --> 30:34.009
- Slowly.
- All right.

30:36.379 --> 30:37.846
(whispers) All right.

30:39.849 --> 30:42.050
Hey, you Levi Hart?

30:42.052 --> 30:44.113
- Man, I played ball too.
- Shut up!

30:45.089 --> 30:46.922
I want Coach Jones. Where is he?

30:48.391 --> 30:50.192
I don't know. I saw you talking to him.

30:50.194 --> 30:51.860
Okay, okay, okay! Calm down, calm down.

30:51.862 --> 30:53.362
Listen, I was right with him
right before all this happened.

30:53.364 --> 30:54.997
I'll take you to him.

30:54.999 --> 30:57.099
If you're lying, I will
put a bullet in your head.

30:57.101 --> 30:58.867
Understood, I'll take you to him.

31:00.170 --> 31:01.370
Let's go.

31:09.214 --> 31:10.313
(Levi) Where's Jones?

31:10.315 --> 31:11.548
Just a little farther.

31:11.550 --> 31:12.682
Come on, pick up the pace.

31:12.684 --> 31:14.017
All right, take it easy.

31:14.019 --> 31:15.752
I'll take it easy when he's dead.

31:17.388 --> 31:19.322
(Weller) <i>Reade, come in.</i>

31:19.324 --> 31:20.493
<i>You hear me?</i>

31:21.893 --> 31:24.154
(Reade) <i>You can put
the gun down now, Levi.</i>

31:24.613 --> 31:25.788
<i>No one else needs to get hurt.</i>

31:25.813 --> 31:27.293
<i>A lot of innocent people died today.</i>

31:28.166 --> 31:29.299
He's alive.

31:29.301 --> 31:30.733
What's he trying to say to us?

31:30.735 --> 31:32.098
I think he's talking to the shooter.

31:33.738 --> 31:34.622
Reade.

31:35.173 --> 31:36.578
Give us your location.

31:36.942 --> 31:38.908
Levi, killing Jones
won't solve anything man.

31:38.910 --> 31:39.976
Whatever trouble you were in before...

31:39.978 --> 31:41.277
This ain't about none of that.

31:41.279 --> 31:42.912
Well, talk to me. Let me help you, man.

31:42.914 --> 31:44.371
Quit stalling.

31:46.083 --> 31:48.151
Tell me where Jones is... <i>now.</i>

31:48.153 --> 31:50.186
All right, he's on
the west side of the building,

31:50.188 --> 31:51.387
where I left him barricaded.

31:51.389 --> 31:52.232
What room?

31:53.058 --> 31:54.557
I don't remember, but if you
get me to the field house

31:54.559 --> 31:55.831
I can take you to him.

31:55.994 --> 31:57.846
Just... just get me to the field house.

32:05.603 --> 32:06.936
Levi, why you doing this, bruh?

32:06.938 --> 32:08.055
Doesn't matter.

32:08.673 --> 32:09.902
It matters to you.

32:11.042 --> 32:13.078
My life is in your hands,
so it matters to me.

32:14.346 --> 32:16.751
So what happened, your coach
is on you, riding you hard?

32:17.382 --> 32:19.429
- At Michigan, my coach...
- This ain't about football.

32:19.851 --> 32:21.472
Jones ruined my life.

32:25.689 --> 32:27.290
How? What did he do?

32:27.292 --> 32:30.927
At first, I thought maybe
it was just Tim and me.

32:33.464 --> 32:36.854
But... that camp he runs...

32:37.536 --> 32:38.749
it's just...

32:40.572 --> 32:41.571
a way to get close to kids.

32:41.573 --> 32:42.814
He's sick.

32:45.042 --> 32:46.797
Okay, tell me what happened.

32:47.379 --> 32:49.221
He ever give you a lift home?

32:49.948 --> 32:51.661
Yeah, he did for a lot of kids.

32:52.784 --> 32:56.452
He ever... invite you in for dinner?

32:56.454 --> 32:57.510
Yeah.

32:58.390 --> 32:59.859
First, it was dinner.

33:00.625 --> 33:01.942
Then it was watching the game.

33:02.294 --> 33:04.060
Just the two of you.

33:05.663 --> 33:08.631
(sighs)

33:08.633 --> 33:10.174
(sobbing) I didn't know how to stop it.

33:10.835 --> 33:12.335
I was gonna come forward in high school,

33:12.337 --> 33:15.138
but then Jones got me
a full ride to Hudson.

33:16.840 --> 33:18.054
I took the money.

33:19.511 --> 33:21.069
I thought I could put it behind me,

33:23.114 --> 33:25.348
but then he brought in some
kids in to watch practice.

33:25.350 --> 33:28.646
I saw 'em, and I knew
it wasn't just Tim and me.

33:29.421 --> 33:30.486
I lost it.

33:32.023 --> 33:33.356
We were going to blow
the lid off everything,

33:33.358 --> 33:34.958
then they busted me for drugs.

33:34.960 --> 33:36.998
Take away all our credibility.

33:37.495 --> 33:39.237
They all covered for him!

33:39.497 --> 33:40.964
I didn't mean to kill
any of those students,

33:40.966 --> 33:42.485
but they got in the way.

33:52.710 --> 33:55.150
Listen, Levi, you have another choice.

33:55.580 --> 33:56.980
Put the gun down and let me help you.

33:56.982 --> 33:58.414
You can't help me.

33:58.416 --> 33:59.582
I believe you.

33:59.584 --> 34:00.883
Okay, we can open an investigation,

34:00.885 --> 34:02.485
we can put Jones away forever,

34:02.487 --> 34:04.220
but you gotta stop,
or else you're gonna die.

34:04.222 --> 34:05.655
I'm trying to offer you another way out.

34:05.657 --> 34:06.309
Please.

34:08.402 --> 34:09.846
I died a long time ago.

34:10.940 --> 34:11.824
Walk.

34:12.263 --> 34:13.237
Walk!

34:39.523 --> 34:40.922
(Reade) It didn't have to end this way.

34:40.925 --> 34:42.492
(Weller) I'm sorry, buddy.

34:42.494 --> 34:43.559
You did everything you could

34:43.561 --> 34:44.824
to get him out of here alive.

34:45.463 --> 34:46.400
Reade...

34:47.498 --> 34:48.536
Jones.

34:49.000 --> 34:50.809
All the bloodshed,

34:51.670 --> 34:53.002
everyone who died, all the families that

34:53.004 --> 34:55.712
lost someone... is because of you.

34:56.675 --> 34:57.774
Is it true?

34:57.776 --> 34:59.108
What are you talking about?

34:59.110 --> 35:00.576
You know what I'm talking about!

35:00.578 --> 35:02.145
If what those two boys
said is really true,

35:02.147 --> 35:03.212
I'll find out, I'll find you,

35:03.214 --> 35:04.614
and I'll put you away myself.

35:06.450 --> 35:07.717
(police radio chatter)

35:07.719 --> 35:09.786
(sirens chirping)

35:09.788 --> 35:13.423
(sirens wailing)

35:20.564 --> 35:23.299
The scores on Jane weren't
from every championship

35:23.301 --> 35:26.703
Hudson ever won, just the four
since Jones was hired.

35:26.705 --> 35:29.572
The creepy hand tattoo was
pointing us straight at him.

35:29.574 --> 35:30.973
What happens next?

35:30.975 --> 35:33.476
Well, the shooter
we took alive, Tim Scott,

35:33.478 --> 35:35.745
corroborated Levi's story.

35:35.747 --> 35:37.613
We're launching an investigation.

35:37.615 --> 35:40.950
It looks like the scholarship
fund was how the university

35:40.952 --> 35:42.985
handed out hush money to the victims.

35:42.987 --> 35:44.253
So this was bigger than Jones.

35:44.255 --> 35:45.621
Much bigger.

35:45.623 --> 35:48.758
The athletic director,
the university president

35:48.760 --> 35:52.462
and some very wealthy donors
all helped to keep this quiet.

35:52.464 --> 35:54.640
Why would anybody cover for this guy?

35:54.966 --> 35:56.466
Well, their football program

35:56.468 --> 35:58.234
brings in millions of dollars
to the school.

35:58.236 --> 35:59.802
They didn't want anything
to mess with that.

35:59.804 --> 36:02.071
Well, Rikers has plenty
of room for all of them.

36:02.507 --> 36:05.074
You should all head home, get some rest.

36:23.278 --> 36:24.627
I'm here because I promised I would...

36:24.629 --> 36:28.624
You're the only one who
knows who I really am.

36:29.467 --> 36:30.720
You know me.

36:31.136 --> 36:32.921
You make me feel real.

36:34.372 --> 36:38.072
And who you are and who we are together

36:38.376 --> 36:40.610
doesn't make you the wrong
person for the job,

36:40.612 --> 36:44.289
it makes you the only
person for the job.

36:47.785 --> 36:49.353
I almost died today.

36:50.655 --> 36:51.854
What?

36:51.856 --> 36:53.427
My life is...

36:57.161 --> 36:58.762
When I see you here

36:59.464 --> 37:03.800
at the end of the day I feel safe.

37:05.169 --> 37:06.391
What happened?

37:07.338 --> 37:08.586
A lot.

37:14.611 --> 37:15.745
You hungry?

37:18.382 --> 37:19.582
Yeah.

37:38.368 --> 37:39.602
(Weller sighing)

37:39.604 --> 37:40.793
You all done?

37:41.239 --> 37:42.371
I'll walk out with you.

37:42.373 --> 37:43.897
I don't feel like going home yet.

37:47.211 --> 37:48.605
Thought you might say that.

37:50.414 --> 37:51.786
(locker opens and shuts)

37:56.253 --> 37:57.921
For days like today.

37:59.090 --> 38:00.208
(sighs)

38:01.959 --> 38:03.864
I'm not much of a bartender.

38:04.395 --> 38:06.025
Hope you like your scotch neat.

38:06.364 --> 38:07.930
(scotch pouring)

38:07.932 --> 38:09.498
And in a paper cup.

38:09.500 --> 38:11.338
I know what you're gonna say.

38:12.237 --> 38:13.936
That none of this is my fault.

38:13.938 --> 38:15.805
There's no way I could have
known a man I looked up to

38:15.807 --> 38:18.017
since I was a kid is such a monster.

38:18.543 --> 38:21.043
None of the lives he ruined
are my responsibility.

38:21.045 --> 38:22.033
And you're right.

38:22.780 --> 38:24.313
I know all this.

38:24.315 --> 38:26.281
But it doesn't make it
any easier to live with.

38:27.485 --> 38:29.334
And I can do without
the lecture, to be honest.

38:30.954 --> 38:32.150
(bottle thuds)

38:35.158 --> 38:36.855
All I was gonna say

38:37.262 --> 38:38.195
is, uh...

38:38.997 --> 38:43.299
this is real expensive...
and really nice scotch.

38:43.301 --> 38:46.740
So... you better drink it.

38:57.848 --> 38:59.348
(man) So, you ready to share

38:59.350 --> 39:01.083
or are you just here
for the good company

39:01.085 --> 39:02.693
and the stale Danishes?

39:05.255 --> 39:09.308
I was a cop, the 96th precinct.

39:09.494 --> 39:11.327
One night on patrol, my partner and I,

39:11.329 --> 39:13.628
we, uh, answered a domestic call,

39:13.998 --> 39:16.572
some drunk beating on his wife.

39:17.302 --> 39:20.169
And we get there and the woman,
she's hysterical,

39:20.493 --> 39:23.472
nose broken, lacerations... it was bad.

39:23.732 --> 39:29.045
And so I'm helping her while
my partner talks to the husband.

39:33.317 --> 39:34.469
I didn't see it happen.

39:35.787 --> 39:37.765
I didn't see the gun
he pulled from the couch.

39:38.556 --> 39:41.524
Didn't see him shoot
my partner point blank

39:41.526 --> 39:43.519
before turning the gun on himself.

39:46.396 --> 39:48.372
After that, I, uh...

39:52.302 --> 39:53.469
My life was a mess.

39:56.239 --> 39:59.175
His death was so random.

40:00.049 --> 40:00.987
So...

40:03.014 --> 40:05.812
(chuckling)
You know, as dumb as it sounds,

40:06.484 --> 40:08.132
when I was gambling,

40:08.920 --> 40:10.260
I knew the rules.

40:11.022 --> 40:12.822
Even when I was losing,
it was on my terms,

40:12.824 --> 40:14.587
it was something I could control.

40:18.261 --> 40:19.988
But it doesn't really
feel that way anymore.

40:25.502 --> 40:26.702
(door opening)

40:28.605 --> 40:32.074
It's all I have: $48,345.

40:37.547 --> 40:38.700
Bethany, thank you.

40:39.217 --> 40:40.806
You could stay.

40:41.619 --> 40:44.357
I have resources at the FBI
that could keep you safe.

40:44.722 --> 40:46.677
Like the CIA kept Carter safe?

40:49.126 --> 40:50.626
Come with me.

40:50.628 --> 40:53.362
Cash out your retirement.
Sell this place.

40:53.364 --> 40:54.930
It would be like a second chance.

40:54.932 --> 40:57.767
We could... disappear together.

40:57.769 --> 41:00.036
You know what I went
through when you died?

41:03.173 --> 41:04.332
I loved you.

41:05.076 --> 41:06.733
I still love you.

41:08.112 --> 41:11.300
But I can never forgive you
for what you did.

41:12.116 --> 41:13.582
You want a second chance?

41:13.584 --> 41:15.884
Accept my protection and stop running.

41:16.320 --> 41:19.455
Otherwise, get the hell out of my house.

41:27.531 --> 41:29.622
(door opens and shuts)

41:41.611 --> 41:43.512
You okay? You seem different.

41:43.514 --> 41:44.880
I'm fine.

41:44.882 --> 41:46.582
You're not getting cold feet?

41:46.584 --> 41:48.484
It's just...

41:48.486 --> 41:49.585
I think we need more time to make sure

41:49.587 --> 41:50.753
everything's in place.

41:50.755 --> 41:53.089
You've gotten too close to her.

41:54.091 --> 41:55.624
Let's get this done.

41:57.160 --> 41:59.261
(zipper unzipping)

42:02.499 --> 42:04.033
(Jane panting)

42:04.035 --> 42:05.034
Ohh!
