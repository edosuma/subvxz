00:00.023 --> 00:01.523
Previously on "Midnight, Texas"...

00:01.526 --> 00:03.629
- Joe is an angel.
- Fallen angel.

00:03.632 --> 00:04.828
Did not suspect that.

00:04.830 --> 00:06.535
I found this. Someone
could have seen you.

00:06.536 --> 00:08.304
The veil that Midnight sits upon,

00:08.307 --> 00:10.534
it's fraying, and evil
is being drawn here.

00:10.535 --> 00:12.234
He's a killer. That's who he is.

00:12.235 --> 00:15.200
He was my son.

00:15.201 --> 00:16.700
I used my light to save her,

00:16.701 --> 00:18.534
which means they will be coming for me.

00:18.535 --> 00:20.234
You chose to protect

00:20.235 --> 00:21.934
all the evil things that he did.

00:21.935 --> 00:23.400
You're all I have left.

00:23.401 --> 00:25.400
I don't ever want to see you again.

00:25.401 --> 00:28.400
Chuy, it's not safe for
you in Midnight anymore.

00:28.401 --> 00:29.868
Stay away.

00:32.735 --> 00:36.567
_

00:36.568 --> 00:40.567
So, how'd it feel?

00:40.568 --> 00:44.267
I don't know. How should it feel?

00:44.268 --> 00:47.300
Oh, for me, there's nothing better.

00:47.301 --> 00:49.234
Definitely didn't feel like that.

00:49.235 --> 00:52.600
I've been fighting demon for millennia.

00:52.601 --> 00:54.734
First time's hard,

00:54.735 --> 00:57.600
but you do it enough, you gain skills,

00:57.601 --> 01:00.567
confidence,

01:00.568 --> 01:02.500
and then it gets fun.

01:05.001 --> 01:07.467
This group, out of
the veil, they were...

01:07.468 --> 01:10.634
they were rough, and
you handled them bravely.

01:10.635 --> 01:12.600
Appreciate you saying so.

01:12.601 --> 01:15.634
Our first battle together.

01:15.635 --> 01:17.173
It won't be our last.

01:23.635 --> 01:26.300
I taught him everything I knew,

01:26.301 --> 01:28.700
and he left.

01:28.701 --> 01:31.434
He just up and left.

01:31.435 --> 01:33.767
But he popped up on my radar recently.

01:33.768 --> 01:37.367
I think he's here.

01:37.368 --> 01:41.467
So, what are you doing in these parts?

01:41.468 --> 01:43.467
The pull.

01:43.468 --> 01:46.500
I was laying low in
Shreveport when I felt it...

01:46.501 --> 01:49.534
this powerful pull

01:49.535 --> 01:53.734
telling me to get my ass to Midnight.

01:53.735 --> 01:57.394
Well, I'm afraid
you're not gonna make it.

01:59.635 --> 02:01.601
I'm not?

02:04.468 --> 02:06.467
Nope.

02:06.468 --> 02:09.667
Because you're a demon.

02:09.668 --> 02:12.667
You're the scourge of the universe.

02:14.435 --> 02:18.367
I do believe that if
you're all exterminated,

02:18.368 --> 02:20.500
this world would be a better place.

02:20.501 --> 02:23.226
Who the hell do you...

02:38.835 --> 02:40.635
An angel?

02:46.435 --> 02:48.368
Give the man a prize.

03:33.501 --> 03:36.501
- More ghosts?
- Not too bad, no.

03:38.135 --> 03:39.934
You're dressed.

03:39.935 --> 03:41.667
And showered.

03:41.668 --> 03:43.134
You feeling better?

03:43.135 --> 03:45.734
I am. I'm going to work.

03:45.735 --> 03:49.767
You sure? It's...

03:49.768 --> 03:53.834
it's only been a few days since, um...

03:53.835 --> 03:55.167
um...

03:55.168 --> 03:57.167
Since I found out my life was a lie,

03:57.168 --> 03:59.934
my brother is a serial killer,
and my dad protected him?

03:59.935 --> 04:02.634
Yeah. Yeah, since that.

04:02.635 --> 04:04.200
You need time.

04:04.201 --> 04:06.500
Time for what?

04:06.501 --> 04:09.228
To go over what
happened again and again?

04:09.231 --> 04:11.563
No. What I need is a distraction.

04:11.566 --> 04:16.163
Hey, you're not alone.

04:16.164 --> 04:18.329
That's the thing. I kind of am.

04:18.331 --> 04:21.164
My family is all gone.

04:22.862 --> 04:24.574
That is the new normal,

04:24.577 --> 04:27.743
and right now I'm done wallowing.

04:27.746 --> 04:30.361
Okay.

04:30.364 --> 04:32.363
You got time for breakfast?

04:32.364 --> 04:34.197
Sorry. I don't.

04:39.897 --> 04:41.929
Just tell me what you need.

04:41.932 --> 04:43.798
Just put me to work.

04:43.799 --> 04:46.164
Midnighters' Room if you
want to be around friends.

04:46.165 --> 04:49.098
If you want the opposite,
inventory in the back.

04:49.099 --> 04:51.165
Inventory sounds perfect.

04:58.099 --> 05:01.264
- She's back so soon?
- She asked to come in.

05:01.265 --> 05:03.864
But I agree with you.
It doesn't feel right.

05:03.865 --> 05:06.264
Sometimes it's good
getting out of the house.

05:06.265 --> 05:08.498
Being out in the world
could be a good distraction.

05:08.499 --> 05:11.065
This isn't out in the
world. This is inventory.

05:19.765 --> 05:22.264
You weren't just talking
about Creek, were you?

05:22.265 --> 05:26.831
The Inquiring Mind's not all that...

05:26.832 --> 05:28.964
pleasant to be in right now,

05:28.965 --> 05:30.964
especially for me.

05:30.965 --> 05:33.998
You still hear it? The demon?

05:33.999 --> 05:36.132
Sometimes it calls my name.

05:37.877 --> 05:40.676
Sometimes it laughs.

05:40.679 --> 05:45.131
When I don't hear it, I'm just waiting.

05:45.132 --> 05:47.332
I liked it better when I
thought I was going crazy.

05:58.299 --> 06:00.998
I could watch you do that all day.

06:00.999 --> 06:03.331
Damn it, Chuy. I
told you to stay away.

06:03.332 --> 06:05.064
Yeah, well, I missed you too much.

06:05.065 --> 06:06.831
- It's not safe for you here.
- It's not safe

06:06.832 --> 06:07.998
for either one of us.

06:07.999 --> 06:10.710
And I'd rather be not safe
together than safe apart.

06:13.165 --> 06:15.098
So, you're out now, to the entire town?

06:15.099 --> 06:16.509
- I had to.
- Of course you did.

06:16.512 --> 06:18.331
Being an angel...
that's what saved Creek.

06:18.332 --> 06:21.064
And it's also very possible
that they'll track me down.

06:21.065 --> 06:23.198
And what are you gonna do?
Wait here until they find you?

06:23.199 --> 06:25.564
- That's the sad plan?
- You have a less risky one?

06:25.565 --> 06:27.528
Yeah. Now that
everybody knows about you,

06:27.531 --> 06:29.830
I say we come clean about all
of it, and we ask for help.

06:29.833 --> 06:32.198
Yeah, and then we put
everyone else in danger.

06:32.199 --> 06:34.164
They're already
sitting on a veil to hell.

06:34.165 --> 06:37.064
That ship has sailed.

06:37.065 --> 06:40.607
It's been just the two
of us for so many centuries.

06:40.610 --> 06:42.498
I think it's time we ask for help.

06:47.599 --> 06:49.964
I reach out to the spirit world.

06:49.965 --> 06:51.364
Show yourself.

06:51.365 --> 06:53.031
I ask for help.

06:53.032 --> 06:55.064
You've been at this a while.

06:55.065 --> 06:57.901
Whoever you're looking
for has left the building.

06:57.904 --> 06:58.904
New client?

06:58.907 --> 07:01.098
No. It's Creek's.

07:01.099 --> 07:03.398
Belonged to her mom, and I thought...

07:03.399 --> 07:06.364
You'd get some wisdom
from the great beyond?

07:06.365 --> 07:08.964
Come on, Manny. You know better.

07:08.965 --> 07:11.964
Her mom could be as nuts as the brother.

07:11.965 --> 07:14.722
I guess I just wanted help.

07:14.725 --> 07:16.999
Any help.

07:17.000 --> 07:18.299
I don't know what to do for her.

07:18.300 --> 07:21.932
Only thing you can do:

07:21.933 --> 07:24.266
be there.

07:32.267 --> 07:35.766
Why are you here? I
don't need a babysitter.

07:35.767 --> 07:39.832
No, no. I know.

07:39.833 --> 07:43.166
It's just there's a
lot of ghosts at home,

07:43.167 --> 07:45.832
and, you know, more
people, fewer ghosts.

07:45.833 --> 07:47.818
Just how it is.

07:47.821 --> 07:50.999
I thought I'd work on
my website from here.

07:51.000 --> 07:55.066
Sorry. I shouldn't
have jumped all over you.

07:55.067 --> 07:57.966
It's all good.

07:57.967 --> 08:01.267
I'll be in the back, working.

08:03.133 --> 08:05.133
- Hey.
- Hey.

08:10.867 --> 08:15.066
So, um, how's she been? Really.

08:15.067 --> 08:17.535
She seems okay. She's quiet.

08:17.538 --> 08:20.332
Everything's quiet. Ever since
what happened with Connor,

08:20.333 --> 08:22.099
the town's different.

08:22.100 --> 08:24.932
Folks are keeping to themselves.

08:24.933 --> 08:26.899
Have you seen Joe since, uh...

08:26.900 --> 08:29.332
Since he flew?

08:29.333 --> 08:30.566
No.

08:30.567 --> 08:33.032
Could be he's lying low.

08:33.033 --> 08:36.166
Rev said that's Joe's scared
that they'd come after him.

08:36.167 --> 08:38.133
Who's "they"?

08:45.568 --> 08:47.032
Can I help you?

08:47.033 --> 08:48.966
Oh, I'm counting on it, Padre.

08:48.967 --> 08:50.266
I'm looking for a man.

08:50.267 --> 08:53.366
I think he's hiding here in Midnight.

08:53.367 --> 08:56.099
Joseph. Blonde.

08:56.100 --> 08:59.932
If I did know him, he
would be a parishioner,

08:59.933 --> 09:02.366
and I could not disclose any information.

09:02.367 --> 09:06.932
You know, once a man of
the cloth realizes who I am,

09:06.933 --> 09:10.132
they cooperate without much fuss.

09:18.367 --> 09:22.432
But there's always an exception.

09:22.433 --> 09:24.399
Where is he?

09:24.400 --> 09:26.666
It's taken me a lifetime

09:26.667 --> 09:29.999
to find a home where I'm
accepted, so I worry.

09:30.000 --> 09:33.232
speak to you!

09:33.233 --> 09:36.399
I was wrong about you.

09:36.400 --> 09:39.332
You're not a man of the cloth.

09:39.333 --> 09:41.399
Not human.

09:41.400 --> 09:45.066
Not animal.

09:45.067 --> 09:47.166
You're nothing.

09:47.167 --> 09:48.900
Ah!

10:19.200 --> 10:21.099
You got to be kidding me.

10:23.433 --> 10:25.432
- Hello?
- This may be nothing, but

10:25.433 --> 10:27.503
there's someone eyeing your shop.

10:31.167 --> 10:34.032
It's Bowie. We're
screwed. She's ancient.

10:34.033 --> 10:35.468
She's way more powerful than I am.

10:35.471 --> 10:37.166
Calm down.

10:37.167 --> 10:39.332
You don't think I'd come
here without a plan, do you?

10:56.400 --> 10:58.699
Joseph, where are you?

11:08.453 --> 11:10.686
She's heading to the Gas & Go.

11:10.687 --> 11:13.052
We're safe for now.
Bowie's not coming this way.

11:13.055 --> 11:16.318
Good, because the two
of us hiding in a closet

11:16.321 --> 11:18.520
is making my head explode.

11:20.787 --> 11:22.720
We can get out of the panic room.

11:25.387 --> 11:26.719
Did you go through my stuff?

11:26.720 --> 11:29.419
Not all of it.

11:29.420 --> 11:31.052
Get over to Olivia's
as soon as you can,

11:31.053 --> 11:33.205
and whatever you do, avoid Bowie.

11:33.208 --> 11:35.152
What if I don't? Eternal damnation?

11:35.153 --> 11:36.752
Angels can read minds,

11:36.753 --> 11:38.419
so she'd use what I just told you

11:38.420 --> 11:40.152
to find and kill Chuy and me.

11:40.153 --> 11:43.219
Well, in that case,
I'll try to avoid her.

11:43.220 --> 11:45.552
Should we tell Creek? Madonna?

11:45.553 --> 11:47.819
No. Angels guard humans.
She won't harm them.

11:47.820 --> 11:49.086
The less they know, the better.

11:49.087 --> 11:50.586
And what about supernaturals?

11:50.587 --> 11:52.472
Oh, she hates supernaturals.

11:52.475 --> 11:53.863
I'll be there when I can.

11:58.820 --> 12:01.452
- How you doing, Lem?
- I'm up during the day.

12:01.453 --> 12:03.419
That's how I'm doing.

12:03.420 --> 12:05.334
Left a message for Emilio to join us.

12:05.337 --> 12:07.452
Bobo's coming. He's just locking up.

12:07.453 --> 12:10.786
- Same security as up here?
- Yeah. I upgraded recently...

12:10.787 --> 12:11.952
since the bombing.

12:11.953 --> 12:13.786
So, the closet's a panic room

12:13.787 --> 12:15.852
inside of an apartment
that's one big panic room?

12:15.853 --> 12:16.975
That's how we like it.

12:20.787 --> 12:22.786
- Hey.
- Hey.

12:22.787 --> 12:26.186
All right, I closed the shop.
So what's the big emergency?

12:26.187 --> 12:28.619
Uh, you're here too?

12:28.620 --> 12:31.452
Why? Wait, why are we here?

12:31.453 --> 12:33.176
Chuy! Hi!

12:33.179 --> 12:35.111
Why are you back,
man? What's going on?

12:35.114 --> 12:37.949
I'll explain everything as
soon as the others get here.

12:54.653 --> 12:56.619
Grandma?

12:56.620 --> 12:57.652
Where the hell are you?

12:57.653 --> 12:59.414
What?

12:59.417 --> 13:01.450
Grandma, I need your help.

13:01.453 --> 13:05.587
And I truly hate that
I'm about to ask this.

13:12.720 --> 13:14.652
Why'd you hide?

13:14.653 --> 13:17.752
I didn't. I was going for
a walk, decided against it.

13:17.753 --> 13:19.359
Joseph Strong. You know him?

13:19.362 --> 13:21.968
Not well. Seems nice.

13:21.971 --> 13:23.719
But I just moved here.

13:23.720 --> 13:26.919
Do you mind if I
ask you some questions?

13:26.920 --> 13:28.753
Sure. Come on in.

13:33.553 --> 13:35.752
What, are you a fortune teller?

13:35.753 --> 13:38.519
I prefer medium. Psychic.

13:38.520 --> 13:41.819
Even the Great Bernardo.

13:41.820 --> 13:43.219
And you are?

13:43.220 --> 13:46.186
Looking for Joseph Strong.

13:46.187 --> 13:48.768
And I'm getting impatient.

13:58.053 --> 14:00.852
Ugh! Ugh, what's wrong with you?

14:00.853 --> 14:02.786
- I don't know what you mean.
- Your head.

14:02.787 --> 14:06.286
I take pills. Sometimes...
actually, no, a lot of times,

14:06.287 --> 14:08.552
I hear voices, see things,

14:08.553 --> 14:10.426
some of which turns
out aren't really there.

14:10.429 --> 14:12.719
I can't always tell
what's real and what's not.

14:12.720 --> 14:14.422
Now is one of those times.

14:17.220 --> 14:18.887
It's real.

14:20.053 --> 14:22.053
Oh, I hate this town.

14:35.085 --> 14:38.317
Well, at least it worked.

14:38.320 --> 14:41.826
I'm gonna go, and
I'm gonna try to forget

14:41.829 --> 14:43.786
that ever happened.

14:47.820 --> 14:49.986
Sorry I'm late.

14:49.987 --> 14:51.719
She came to my RV.

14:51.720 --> 14:52.997
- She didn't get in your head?
- She did,

14:52.999 --> 14:55.852
but my grandma was already in there.

14:55.853 --> 14:58.519
She couldn't read much. It
was too crowded, too confusing.

14:58.522 --> 15:00.686
- As is this.
- The Rev still isn't

15:00.687 --> 15:02.787
picking up, and I'm done waiting.

15:07.020 --> 15:10.919
Chuy and I need your help.

15:10.920 --> 15:13.986
There's an angel named
Bowie in Midnight,

15:13.987 --> 15:15.619
and she's hunting me.

15:15.620 --> 15:18.752
An angel? We're scared of an angel?

15:18.753 --> 15:22.475
Well, angels not only protect
humans, they also kill demons.

15:22.478 --> 15:24.652
Bowie only liked the
killing part of the job.

15:24.653 --> 15:25.529
You know her?

15:25.532 --> 15:27.131
Yeah, she's a mentor and a friend.

15:27.134 --> 15:29.350
I walked away from that
life without a word and

15:29.353 --> 15:31.652
I'm sure she's still angry and hurt and

15:31.653 --> 15:33.652
wants me dead.

15:33.653 --> 15:35.788
So she's mad because you left?

15:35.791 --> 15:37.733
Leaving the fold, being fallen,

15:37.736 --> 15:39.139
she might've forgiven that.

15:39.142 --> 15:43.019
But it's who I fell in
love with she can't forgive.

15:43.022 --> 15:45.284
Oh. A man?

15:47.119 --> 15:50.885
No, not a man. Um...

15:53.710 --> 15:55.077
A demon.

16:04.821 --> 16:07.529
The first time I saw him
was in this marketplace,

16:07.532 --> 16:09.736
haggling with some pretty sketchy guys.

16:09.737 --> 16:12.770
Silk Road traders. I
wanted this porcelain.

16:12.771 --> 16:14.436
They asked for more
than I had, so I left.

16:14.437 --> 16:16.070
And I followed. Saw the traders

16:16.071 --> 16:18.436
beating the crap out of him.

16:18.437 --> 16:21.736
So, I showed a little
wing and scared them off.

16:21.737 --> 16:23.070
I went to help Chuy up

16:23.071 --> 16:26.770
and saw that he was
covered in black blood.

16:26.771 --> 16:28.903
- Demon blood.
- They not only beat him...

16:28.904 --> 16:30.836
they also stole his sandals.

16:30.837 --> 16:32.936
I asked him why didn't
he just tear them apart,

16:32.937 --> 16:35.936
and he said maybe they needed
the sandals more than he did.

16:35.937 --> 16:37.103
And that changed everything.

16:37.104 --> 16:39.269
Bowie told us we were superior,

16:39.272 --> 16:41.936
that demons were evil,
and angels killing demons

16:41.937 --> 16:44.289
was doing a service...
Chuy disproved all of it.

16:44.292 --> 16:45.936
I still can't get
over it. You're a demon?

16:45.937 --> 16:49.136
Half-demon. My mom was human.

16:49.137 --> 16:51.903
Parents were another forbidden love?

16:51.904 --> 16:54.436
It wasn't love.

16:54.437 --> 16:55.818
My mom and I were close.

16:55.821 --> 16:57.570
She taught me to
control my demonic side.

16:57.571 --> 16:59.903
She said that our connection
would keep me strong.

16:59.904 --> 17:02.103
Now I have this connection
to keep me strong.

17:02.104 --> 17:03.436
Yeah, but you should've told us.

17:03.437 --> 17:05.103
They're telling us now.

17:05.104 --> 17:07.136
Yeah, now there's an
angry angel in Midnight.

17:07.137 --> 17:09.136
They're immortal. Fiji's
right. This shouldn't be

17:09.137 --> 17:10.903
the first time we're hearing about this.

17:10.904 --> 17:14.502
Look, Joe saved Creek.

17:14.503 --> 17:16.502
I'm willing to return the favor.

17:16.503 --> 17:20.170
So, angels... how do we deal with them?

17:20.171 --> 17:22.435
Well, they're tough.
Angels can read your mind,

17:22.436 --> 17:24.170
use your secrets against you.

17:24.171 --> 17:26.403
Great. And immortal.

17:26.404 --> 17:28.170
No. Almost immortal.

17:28.171 --> 17:30.403
Humans can't kill an angel,

17:30.404 --> 17:32.970
and I'm not tough enough to
take on an angel like Bowie.

17:32.971 --> 17:36.570
But demons can, right?

17:36.571 --> 17:38.603
Oh, that... that is not an option.

17:38.604 --> 17:42.170
Last time he changed, it took
three years to get him back.

17:42.171 --> 17:44.536
If Chuy turns, we're all in danger.

17:44.537 --> 17:46.870
I can't. I'm sorry.

17:46.871 --> 17:48.170
Okay, if we can't kill her,

17:48.171 --> 17:50.970
maybe we can send her somewhere else,

17:50.971 --> 17:54.136
where there are demons
who can take care of her.

17:54.137 --> 17:57.470
The exorcism at my house...
the mirror acted as a portal.

17:57.471 --> 17:59.421
And we saw over to the
other side of the veil.

17:59.424 --> 18:01.072
What if we created a portal

18:01.075 --> 18:03.103
and trapped her on the
other side of the veil?

18:03.104 --> 18:05.870
Are you suggesting we
send an angel to hell?

18:05.871 --> 18:10.170
- Will that work?
- I think it just might.

18:10.171 --> 18:13.470
So Bowie... she can read
everything inside your head?

18:13.471 --> 18:14.765
All angels can.

18:14.768 --> 18:16.903
Wait... you can read our thoughts?

18:16.904 --> 18:18.903
Only if I choose to, which I don't.

18:18.904 --> 18:22.036
I won't abuse that power. I
haven't used it in centuries.

18:22.037 --> 18:24.236
But Bowie... she won't
hesitate to use what she reads

18:24.237 --> 18:25.825
to get her way...

18:25.828 --> 18:27.060
or humiliate you.

18:27.063 --> 18:29.203
Sounds like a lovely person.

18:29.204 --> 18:30.841
If you'll excuse me.

18:32.806 --> 18:35.205
There's just so many
secrets floating around here.

18:35.208 --> 18:37.670
I can hardly keep up.

18:37.671 --> 18:40.036
Not everyone can be
an open book like you.

18:40.037 --> 18:42.203
Oh, I have my secrets.

18:42.204 --> 18:44.470
They just can't come back
to hurt anyone but me.

18:44.471 --> 18:46.043
You don't know that.

18:54.937 --> 18:56.570
Do you have more secrets?

18:56.571 --> 18:58.503
Mm... nothing as huge.

18:58.504 --> 19:00.203
Just small stuff.

19:00.204 --> 19:01.703
Like what?

19:01.704 --> 19:04.270
Like I miss my family.

19:04.271 --> 19:08.036
Not what they believe
in. Not the violence.

19:08.037 --> 19:11.570
I miss Thanksgiving.

19:11.571 --> 19:15.603
I miss my mom.

19:15.604 --> 19:17.236
That's got to be hard.

19:17.237 --> 19:19.171
And I love you.

19:25.104 --> 19:27.137
Okay.

19:32.637 --> 19:34.636
I got to get going...

19:34.637 --> 19:37.103
The portal. I got to...

19:37.104 --> 19:39.270
get going on...

19:40.704 --> 19:42.636
Not sure electricity's
gonna stop them.

19:42.637 --> 19:45.103
Well, I have to do something.

19:45.104 --> 19:47.103
Angels are mean and powerful.

19:47.104 --> 19:50.136
And they're not fans of vampires.

19:50.137 --> 19:53.636
I'm growing tired of all the secrets.

19:53.637 --> 19:56.770
I have a hidden armory.

19:56.771 --> 19:58.670
I'm good with secrets.

19:58.671 --> 20:00.170
Any you want to tell me?

20:00.171 --> 20:02.171
No.

20:04.637 --> 20:09.303
I mean, it's not
exactly a secret, but...

20:09.304 --> 20:13.103
what you and I have
has an expiration date.

20:13.104 --> 20:15.136
I'm not sure what you mean.

20:15.137 --> 20:18.636
That you stay like
this, and I'll get old.

20:18.637 --> 20:21.003
And that can't work indefinitely.

20:21.004 --> 20:23.736
So when the time comes, I'll leave.

20:23.737 --> 20:26.670
Not anytime soon, but...

20:26.671 --> 20:28.670
eventually.

20:28.671 --> 20:33.170
There are other options.
This doesn't have to end.

20:33.171 --> 20:35.737
Yes, it does.

20:43.171 --> 20:46.204
I don't want to be turned.

20:57.371 --> 21:01.171
We can enjoy this while it lasts.

21:05.171 --> 21:06.771
Let's.

21:19.337 --> 21:23.036
- Is that a, uh...
- Finger. Yeah.

21:23.037 --> 21:26.636
Belonged to an ancient
relative of mine, Uncle Roland.

21:26.637 --> 21:30.036
Legend is he pushed a
demon back to hell with it.

21:30.037 --> 21:33.336
Soon as he touched the
demon, his finger fell off.

21:33.337 --> 21:35.403
You certainly have a colorful past.

21:35.404 --> 21:39.736
I used to think they were
just stories my grandma made up.

21:39.737 --> 21:41.736
The Great Bernardo clan,

21:41.737 --> 21:45.103
and the evil they battled.

21:45.104 --> 21:46.836
You ever think it's not a coincidence

21:46.837 --> 21:49.370
you're here in Midnight
right as the veil frays?

21:49.371 --> 21:52.870
It's a coincidence or really bad luck.

21:52.871 --> 21:55.137
I think it's something else.

22:02.437 --> 22:05.770
Madonna, you've wiped down
that counter five times already.

22:05.771 --> 22:08.236
- Oh, have I?
- Yeah. You're hovering.

22:08.237 --> 22:11.470
You're working a double
shift your first day back,

22:11.471 --> 22:15.436
and you're going on
eight hours, no break.

22:15.437 --> 22:17.370
Fine. I'll take a break.

22:59.804 --> 23:02.604
Rev, can you hear me?

23:04.837 --> 23:06.171
Okay.

23:07.471 --> 23:10.903
Madonna? I need...

23:10.904 --> 23:13.503
Where is Midnight?

23:13.504 --> 23:15.536
Don't let her touch you.

23:15.537 --> 23:17.503
Go. Go.

23:19.204 --> 23:22.503
Saw you in the fortune teller's mind.

23:22.504 --> 23:25.503
When the veil starts
to tear, a hero will rise.

23:25.504 --> 23:27.203
He will lead an army

23:27.204 --> 23:29.970
to fight the evil that emerges
and seal the veil forever.

23:29.971 --> 23:31.575
Oh, we should call this person.

23:31.578 --> 23:33.368
A man with the gift of vision,

23:33.371 --> 23:38.270
who can bridge the worlds
between the living and the dead.

23:38.271 --> 23:41.002
Why are you looking at me?

23:41.005 --> 23:42.337
You're joking.

23:42.338 --> 23:44.536
All the signs point to you,

23:44.537 --> 23:46.803
meaning now you are leading
the move against Bowie.

23:46.804 --> 23:49.370
That's a pretty
big leap from one plan

23:49.371 --> 23:50.903
to stopping the apocalypse.

23:50.904 --> 23:52.370
Well, I believe it's you.

23:52.371 --> 23:53.536
Then you're insane.

23:57.837 --> 23:59.003
Creek, you okay?

23:59.006 --> 24:01.257
No, not really.

24:02.971 --> 24:05.536
She's sad.

24:05.537 --> 24:08.970
Oh, yeah, just a tad depressed.

24:08.971 --> 24:12.870
Where's Joseph?

24:12.871 --> 24:14.536
- I don't know.
- You have 30 minutes

24:14.537 --> 24:15.970
to find out,

24:15.971 --> 24:18.570
and then I'm gonna start killing people.

24:22.170 --> 24:24.403
I-I thought angels didn't hurt humans.

24:24.404 --> 24:28.166
Yeah, not normally, but today
has been a very frustrating day.

24:30.404 --> 24:31.903
Hey,

24:31.904 --> 24:34.403
tell him that you love him.

24:34.404 --> 24:35.836
I love you.

24:35.837 --> 24:38.403
Creek, you're gonna be all right.

24:38.404 --> 24:41.337
It's gonna be her
body I toss out first.

24:43.311 --> 24:45.845
Bring Joseph!

24:48.537 --> 24:51.304
- What do you want me to do?
- I want you to surrender.

24:56.685 --> 24:59.758
Maybe I'm selfish, but I want
another century or two with you.

24:59.759 --> 25:03.791
And I think Manfred's
our best shot at that.

25:03.792 --> 25:05.592
Okay?

25:13.759 --> 25:16.391
Just so we're clear,

25:16.392 --> 25:18.558
we're doing whatever it
takes to get Creek back.

25:18.559 --> 25:20.791
I understand.

25:20.792 --> 25:23.824
Creek, get me a drink. Whiskey.

25:23.825 --> 25:25.091
I'll get it.

25:25.092 --> 25:26.912
You leave her alone.

25:26.915 --> 25:29.904
I know where you got the
money to pay for this place,

25:29.907 --> 25:34.591
so sit down and shut up.

25:34.592 --> 25:36.756
Creek, get me a drink.

25:48.340 --> 25:52.424
Hey, you know, at least
your mind is off of it,

25:52.425 --> 25:53.895
right?

25:53.898 --> 25:57.858
What with your dad and
your evil kid brother.

25:57.859 --> 26:00.858
I know what you think:

26:00.859 --> 26:02.624
that you let it happen,

26:02.625 --> 26:06.524
that you had blinders on.

26:06.525 --> 26:09.159
But the truth is... you did.

26:09.162 --> 26:11.061
You really dropped the ball there.

26:11.064 --> 26:13.558
Stop it! She's been through enough.

26:13.559 --> 26:16.021
Has she? You think she's had enough?

26:16.024 --> 26:19.024
'Cause I'm pretty sure that
she can take a little bit more.

26:20.857 --> 26:23.690
Hey, Creek, you want to
hear what it sounded like

26:23.691 --> 26:25.256
when your brother's neck snapped?

26:25.257 --> 26:27.656
No!

26:27.657 --> 26:31.056
Just having fun.

26:33.691 --> 26:36.591
You're fallen, too, aren't you?

26:38.291 --> 26:41.956
Yeah. I had some anger issues.

26:41.957 --> 26:44.556
You want me? I'm here!

26:44.557 --> 26:46.131
And there's why.

26:52.724 --> 26:57.023
Oh, you know when you've
waited so long for something

26:57.024 --> 26:59.790
and it finally happens?

26:59.791 --> 27:04.757
It's so much sweeter
than you ever imagined.

27:10.924 --> 27:12.923
Since when do you harm humans?

27:12.924 --> 27:16.823
Since you started
hiding behind them, Joe.

27:19.324 --> 27:23.323
Oh, but I'm like you now.

27:23.324 --> 27:25.090
Fallen.

27:25.091 --> 27:27.923
A soldier without a country.

27:27.924 --> 27:29.723
I left, too.

27:29.724 --> 27:33.090
All the restrictions and the rules

27:33.091 --> 27:38.090
just got to be a little bit too much.

27:38.091 --> 27:40.528
Joe, do you remember

27:40.531 --> 27:44.690
on this very ground

27:44.691 --> 27:47.056
- you and I...
- Come on.

27:47.057 --> 27:50.690
Battling demons
before you betrayed me?

27:50.691 --> 27:53.623
I didn't betray you. I fell in love.

27:53.624 --> 27:55.890
Everything you were,

27:55.891 --> 27:58.023
you threw away because of a demon?

27:58.024 --> 28:00.123
I wasn't who you thought I was...

28:00.124 --> 28:01.286
Hurry.

28:01.289 --> 28:04.923
Who you wanted me
to be. Please, Bowie,

28:04.924 --> 28:06.723
I'm asking you: don't do this.

28:06.724 --> 28:09.504
Aww, you want compassion?

28:09.507 --> 28:11.123
Mercy?

28:11.124 --> 28:13.191
That's not how I roll.

28:15.389 --> 28:18.252
- Good.
- I am so angry, Joe,

28:18.255 --> 28:21.123
and when I'm angry,

28:21.124 --> 28:23.723
I want to kill things!

28:23.724 --> 28:25.091
Now!

28:37.091 --> 28:40.423
Ancestors, I summon you.

28:40.424 --> 28:42.123
What's your problem?

28:42.124 --> 28:43.923
Why are you looking at me?

28:43.924 --> 28:47.456
- You'll be safe...
- Well, I believe in...

28:50.091 --> 28:53.190
You totally think that
you're gonna stop hell

28:53.191 --> 28:55.856
from swallowing this town whole

28:55.857 --> 28:57.023
Wow.

28:57.024 --> 29:00.891
You have a really
inflated sense of self.

29:05.024 --> 29:08.156
Hey, Creek, come meet your superhero.

29:09.655 --> 29:12.854
Oh, yeah, she knows the truth about you.

29:12.857 --> 29:14.023
Please don't.

29:14.024 --> 29:17.090
You're a scam artist.

29:17.091 --> 29:19.456
I mean, yeah, you see ghosts,

29:19.457 --> 29:22.490
but how are you helpful?

29:22.491 --> 29:25.123
You're not!

29:25.124 --> 29:27.156
Oh, and your girlfriend?

29:27.157 --> 29:29.223
Oh, she's pissed.

29:29.224 --> 29:34.223
I mean, what is the point
of screwing the town psychic

29:34.224 --> 29:37.523
if he's not even gonna
give you a heads up

29:37.524 --> 29:40.020
that you're living with a serial killer?

29:43.491 --> 29:45.190
You failed...

30:14.247 --> 30:18.046
- I'm sorry I hurt you.
- You humiliated me.

30:34.313 --> 30:36.313
This isn't about you.

30:36.316 --> 30:38.979
No! No. Isn't it?

30:41.147 --> 30:45.079
My top student,

30:45.080 --> 30:48.012
someone I bragged about,

30:48.013 --> 30:50.446
runs off with a demon!

30:50.447 --> 30:52.247
And I'd do it again.

31:11.313 --> 31:13.413
Ever see an angel die?

31:16.213 --> 31:18.180
It really is something.

31:23.380 --> 31:25.213
Chuy, no!

31:29.413 --> 31:31.447
You left me for that?

31:33.480 --> 31:37.179
Get off me!

31:37.180 --> 31:39.212
I don't know much about
demons, but I'm thinking...

31:39.213 --> 31:41.046
We got to go.

31:41.047 --> 31:43.012
Come on!

31:43.013 --> 31:45.479
- How do we stop him?
- We don't. You run.

32:03.347 --> 32:07.112
She's gone now. Bowie's gone.

32:08.114 --> 32:10.379
It would be wise for
us to get inside now.

32:10.380 --> 32:13.412
Goddess, Lem, you can't
come in! The dead can't enter!

32:13.413 --> 32:15.112
I forgot.

32:15.113 --> 32:17.047
It's time for you to come back to me.

32:19.047 --> 32:20.379
Get inside! Now!

32:20.380 --> 32:22.412
- I'll try leeching him.
- I'm sorry!

33:14.580 --> 33:18.112
I will kill you. Please
don't make me have to.

33:20.447 --> 33:22.213
It would destroy me.

33:23.580 --> 33:26.579
You said our connection
would keep you strong.

33:26.580 --> 33:28.247
Please!

33:39.247 --> 33:41.113
Okay.

33:59.147 --> 34:02.312
Hey. I should get home.

34:02.313 --> 34:04.112
I'll walk you over.

34:04.113 --> 34:07.179
It's right across the street.

34:07.180 --> 34:09.646
You should stay in
case someone needs you.

34:16.380 --> 34:18.411
Take tomorrow off.

34:28.480 --> 34:31.246
I really think you
should go to the ER.

34:31.246 --> 34:33.312
Those ribs could be broken.

34:33.313 --> 34:36.094
It's okay. Even if they are,
they'll reset next full moon.

34:36.097 --> 34:38.679
The transformation can fix things.

34:38.679 --> 34:41.246
- Feeling better?
- No.

34:41.246 --> 34:43.746
But it doesn't matter.
You're still here.

34:46.213 --> 34:47.647
Let's get you home.

34:51.746 --> 34:53.946
Stop by the studio later.

34:53.947 --> 34:55.280
We should talk.

35:04.513 --> 35:06.213
I am so sorry.

35:18.180 --> 35:19.946
You up for going home?

35:19.947 --> 35:21.813
No, but I need our bed.

35:25.213 --> 35:27.246
Well, hey, at least now we know

35:27.247 --> 35:29.279
we're not the only
mixed couple in Midnight.

35:29.280 --> 35:32.479
I know a lot of new
things after today.

36:01.813 --> 36:06.779
If Chuy is only half demon,

36:06.780 --> 36:09.812
then what happens when the veil opens?

36:09.813 --> 36:11.713
That.

36:14.771 --> 36:18.303
You still believe

36:18.313 --> 36:20.479
I can do something to fix this?

36:20.480 --> 36:21.746
Yes.

36:21.747 --> 36:24.612
I think you're gonna lead an army

36:24.613 --> 36:26.246
and seal the veil forever.

36:26.247 --> 36:29.512
I don't lead armies.

36:29.513 --> 36:32.313
I see dead soldiers after it's too late.

36:34.447 --> 36:38.046
I couldn't stop Bowie.
I couldn't stop Chuy.

36:38.047 --> 36:41.423
You arrived in Midnight
exactly when we needed you.

36:49.547 --> 36:53.379
You were here the first
time the veil opened, right?

36:53.380 --> 36:55.446
You saw it?

36:55.447 --> 36:59.379
So you need to believe that I'm the one,

36:59.380 --> 37:02.646
because if I'm not,
then this happens, and...

37:02.647 --> 37:04.812
Midnight's screwed.

37:04.813 --> 37:06.879
And you're still here.

37:06.880 --> 37:09.679
The man who was after you...
he's no longer a threat,

37:09.680 --> 37:13.379
and you are still in Midnight.

37:13.380 --> 37:15.747
You, of all people, should get why.

37:18.413 --> 37:20.746
It's her.

37:20.747 --> 37:22.475
I'm here because of her.

37:27.155 --> 37:30.131
Hey, you need help?

37:30.132 --> 37:33.464
What I need's peace and quiet!

37:33.465 --> 37:36.164
I miss our quiet little town

37:36.165 --> 37:40.631
where nothing happened, ever.

37:40.632 --> 37:43.865
Now everything's so exhausting!

37:47.865 --> 37:50.431
Hey, I'll clean up,

37:50.432 --> 37:54.264
and you can get some rest.

37:54.265 --> 37:57.298
I'll stay on the porch.

37:57.299 --> 37:58.464
You get scared,

37:58.465 --> 38:04.264
you feel a little demonic presence,

38:04.265 --> 38:06.631
I'm right out here.

38:06.632 --> 38:10.298
You'd be willing to do that?

38:10.299 --> 38:12.832
Well, yeah. I'm happy to.

38:20.332 --> 38:22.465
I'll take you up on that.

38:25.332 --> 38:27.398
We've got to go.

38:27.399 --> 38:30.164
It's the veil. I can't keep fighting it.

38:30.165 --> 38:32.165
Let's get you out of here. Come on.

38:42.532 --> 38:45.431
I thought you'd be asleep.

38:45.432 --> 38:47.332
I couldn't sleep.

38:50.861 --> 38:52.471
I'm sorry.

38:55.399 --> 39:00.264
I never would've said any
of those things to you.

39:00.265 --> 39:03.731
They were mean. They were unfair.

39:03.732 --> 39:06.831
And they were right.

39:06.832 --> 39:10.531
I see a lot of things that...
that I don't want to see,

39:10.532 --> 39:12.998
and they're not always
things that can help.

39:12.999 --> 39:16.464
I know that.

39:16.465 --> 39:18.399
But I want to help you.

39:20.899 --> 39:22.899
Can I help you now?

39:26.465 --> 39:29.232
Yeah. Yeah.

39:31.399 --> 39:35.764
You were right. Um, I need time.

39:35.765 --> 39:37.564
Yeah.

39:37.565 --> 39:40.531
I don't really know who I am

39:40.532 --> 39:45.564
without being a sister or a daughter...

39:45.565 --> 39:48.764
who I am not in
relation to someone else.

39:48.765 --> 39:52.064
Um, do I go to school?

39:52.065 --> 39:54.398
Do I want to write?

39:54.399 --> 39:56.899
What's next for me?

40:02.432 --> 40:06.431
That's something that I...

40:06.432 --> 40:09.332
I need to be alone to figure out.

40:14.432 --> 40:16.265
Oh. Uh...

40:21.865 --> 40:26.599
O-okay. So... hm.

40:27.965 --> 40:30.465
This is... this is over?

40:34.499 --> 40:36.331
You asked how you could help.

40:36.332 --> 40:39.032
Yeah, I did. And...

40:42.465 --> 40:44.899
I get it. Whatever you need.

40:55.832 --> 40:58.498
You're really amazing.

40:58.499 --> 41:01.031
Yeah, yeah, you too.

41:01.032 --> 41:04.631
Um...

41:04.632 --> 41:07.998
take the bedroom if you want to sleep.

41:07.999 --> 41:10.399
I'll just take the... the couch.

41:13.999 --> 41:15.631
Okay.

41:36.365 --> 41:38.498
What the hell you doing?

41:38.499 --> 41:41.031
- What I do best.
- Which is?

41:41.032 --> 41:43.598
I bail. It's what I do.

41:43.599 --> 41:46.354
Manny, you were setting roots.

41:46.357 --> 41:50.531
You liked it here. You
had a place in Midnight.

41:50.532 --> 41:52.531
Turns out, I didn't.
