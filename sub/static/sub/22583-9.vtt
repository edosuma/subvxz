00:30.159 --> 00:32.107
Any last words?

00:32.107 --> 00:34.490
Go to hell.

00:34.490 --> 00:37.671
Didn't know Skags believed in hell.

00:37.671 --> 00:39.330
Hyah!

01:02.898 --> 01:07.235
Song: "Faith of the Heart"
It's been a long road,

01:07.235 --> 01:10.648
Getting from there to here,

01:10.648 --> 01:14.241
It's been a long time,

01:14.241 --> 01:18.214
But my time is finally near,

01:18.214 --> 01:22.498
And I will see my dream come alive at last,

01:22.498 --> 01:26.226
I will touch the sky

01:26.226 --> 01:29.916
And they're not gonna hold me down no more,

01:29.916 --> 01:33.076
No they're not gonna change my mind,

01:33.076 --> 01:37.807
Cause I've got faith of the heart,

01:37.807 --> 01:40.639
I'm going where my heart will take me,

01:40.639 --> 01:45.730
I've got faith to believe,

01:45.730 --> 01:48.478
I can do anything,

01:48.478 --> 01:56.126
I've got strength of the soul,
But no one gonna bend or break me,

01:56.126 --> 02:02.040
I can reach any star,

02:02.040 --> 02:05.951
I've got faith,

02:05.951 --> 02:13.483
I've got faith, faith of the heart.

02:21.186 --> 02:25.795
061 (3x09) North Star

02:33.485 --> 02:36.857
Who's paying for the box?

02:41.216 --> 02:44.371
I hope you're not planning to bury him in the cemetery.

02:44.371 --> 02:47.117
His people don't bury their dead...

02:47.117 --> 02:49.603
but I wouldn't expect you to know that.

02:49.603 --> 02:52.324
I'm sorry I didn't get there in time to stop them.

02:52.324 --> 02:53.799
What difference would it have made?

02:53.799 --> 02:55.886
He'd have gotten a trial.

02:55.886 --> 02:59.828
And the same people that lynched him would've been sitting on the jury.

03:00.466 --> 03:03.153
Bethany.

03:03.153 --> 03:04.885
He killed a man.

03:04.885 --> 03:09.489
Self-defense or not, that's a hanging offense for a Skag.

03:35.381 --> 03:36.541
What've you got?

03:36.541 --> 03:38.594
I've confirmed that they're human.

03:38.594 --> 03:42.508
Their DNA is a perfect match.

03:43.640 --> 03:47.604
Looks pretty authentic, Captain, right down to the spittoons.

03:47.604 --> 03:50.164
And the hangings.

03:52.786 --> 04:00.356
If these people are from Earth... ...how the hell did they get here?

04:02.296 --> 04:04.694
Archer to Enterprise. Report.

04:04.694 --> 04:06.833
We've scanned 90% of the surface.

04:06.833 --> 04:14.004
The human settlements are clustered within a few hundred kilometers of your location... about 6,000 people.

04:14.004 --> 04:15.294
And the aliens?

04:15.294 --> 04:16.839
Fewer than 1,000.

04:16.839 --> 04:21.519
Their closest encampment is ten kilometers northwest of your position.

04:21.519 --> 04:25.611
Any signs of technology--energy signatures, vessels?

04:25.611 --> 04:26.817
None, sir.

04:26.817 --> 04:32.641
Our quantum scans put the earliest structures at over 250 years old.

04:32.641 --> 04:33.725
That sounds about right.

04:33.725 --> 04:37.582
But they're all constructed of materials indigenous to the planet.

04:37.582 --> 04:39.594
Acknowledged.

04:40.396 --> 04:42.300
I want you to go check out that alien settlement.

04:42.300 --> 04:43.927
See what you can find.

04:44.693 --> 04:46.393
There's no telling how anyone would react

04:46.393 --> 04:48.653
if they find out who we really are.

04:48.653 --> 04:51.080
- Keep a low profile.
- Aye, sir.

05:07.487 --> 05:09.511
Morning.

05:09.511 --> 05:11.060
Can I help you folks?

05:11.060 --> 05:12.685
I hope so.

05:12.685 --> 05:14.526
We need a horse.

05:14.526 --> 05:16.660
What happened to yours?

05:16.660 --> 05:17.506
Excuse me?

05:17.506 --> 05:19.411
It's a long way from the next town.

05:19.411 --> 05:22.510
How'd you get here?

05:22.510 --> 05:31.851
Our horses perished several miles north of your town... from... heat exhaustion.

05:31.851 --> 05:38.265
Well, you're lucky the sun vipers didn't get you... or those Skags.

05:42.295 --> 05:44.133
Come on.

05:44.994 --> 05:47.847
This one here... only four years old.

05:47.847 --> 05:52.103
Good stock.

05:52.103 --> 05:54.568
$20, she's yours.

05:54.568 --> 05:57.419
Sounds kinda steep.

05:57.419 --> 06:00.060
I don't suppose you'd be interested in a trade.

06:00.060 --> 06:04.344
Well, that depends on what you got to trade.

06:12.489 --> 06:15.190
I haven't seen one of these in years.

06:15.190 --> 06:20.062
Look, uh, I know it's not worth a horse but we only need him for a couple of hours.

06:20.062 --> 06:22.177
We just want to ride out, grab our gear.

06:22.177 --> 06:25.143
We'll be back before you know it.

06:28.524 --> 06:35.057
Well, how about I leave my gun for collateral?

06:39.440 --> 06:41.943
You got yourself a deal.

06:41.943 --> 06:43.289
Here, buddy.

06:43.289 --> 06:46.211
Go on. Go on, girl.

07:03.332 --> 07:06.561
Do you have any experience riding these animals?

07:06.561 --> 07:08.592
I've seen every John Ford western.

07:08.592 --> 07:10.399
Who?

07:10.399 --> 07:13.496
Look. How hard can it be?

07:24.986 --> 07:28.213
You better hold on.

07:54.061 --> 07:55.362
Afternoon.

07:55.362 --> 07:56.479
What can I get you?

07:56.479 --> 07:58.041
I'm passing through town.

07:58.041 --> 08:01.265
I was hoping I could sit in here for a while until it cools down.

08:01.265 --> 08:02.587
Coffee's on the house.

08:02.587 --> 08:04.072
Thanks.

08:04.072 --> 08:06.233
Where you headed?

08:06.233 --> 08:08.283
My brother's got a ranch down south.

08:08.283 --> 08:10.960
He said he could set me up with some work.

08:10.960 --> 08:14.999
What's he raising, bluehorns?

08:14.999 --> 08:16.121
How'd you know?

08:16.121 --> 08:19.535
Land down there's not good for much else.

08:26.003 --> 08:29.628
See any resemblance?

08:34.515 --> 08:37.456
Well, yeah... yeah, I do.

08:37.456 --> 08:40.532
You're not telling me you're related to Cooper Smith.

08:40.532 --> 08:42.138
He's my ancestor.

08:42.138 --> 08:43.315
I'll be damned.

08:43.315 --> 08:44.100
Yep.

08:44.100 --> 08:48.480
You're looking at the only direct descendent of the man who overthrew the Skags.

08:48.480 --> 08:50.466
I'll bet you got some stories.

08:50.466 --> 08:52.841
I got a few I can tell you.

08:56.084 --> 08:58.174
- You boys still at it?
- Just getting started.

08:58.174 --> 08:59.714
Looks like it's over for you, McClowery.

08:59.714 --> 09:02.583
- Friends of yours?
- Not particularly.

09:02.583 --> 09:05.298
How about a little service?

09:05.298 --> 09:07.614
What'll it be?

09:08.463 --> 09:12.895
Anything but that rotgut you were pouring yesterday.

09:18.898 --> 09:20.897
Why don't you join us?

09:20.897 --> 09:22.520
You know I'm not allowed to do that, Mr. Bennings.

09:22.520 --> 09:30.077
It's Deputy Bennings and I can bend a local ordinance if I choose.

09:30.077 --> 09:32.666
Have a seat.

09:38.176 --> 09:44.584
I imagine you could use a drink... after what happened last night.

09:46.254 --> 09:53.466
Let's raise a glass... to the dearly departed.

09:53.466 --> 09:55.596
To dead Skags.

10:00.373 --> 10:01.979
Drink up.

10:15.322 --> 10:19.225
I thought you people could hold your liquor.

10:19.225 --> 10:23.564
Your friend had a few in him the night he killed Clay Stanton.

10:23.564 --> 10:25.880
He didn't drink.

10:27.324 --> 10:29.943
Beg your pardon?

10:31.536 --> 10:32.480
I'd better get back to work.

10:32.480 --> 10:35.113
Oh, no. Wait a minute.

10:35.113 --> 10:37.440
I don't think I heard you right.

10:37.440 --> 10:44.798
You're telling me that a sober Skag had the nerve to shoot a man?

10:44.798 --> 10:48.202
I find that hard to believe.

10:49.479 --> 10:52.365
Maybe you could demonstrate.

11:10.225 --> 11:12.674
Pick it up.

11:12.674 --> 11:14.694
Shoot me.

11:14.694 --> 11:18.987
Right here, between the eyes.

11:18.987 --> 11:22.175
This is your golden opportunity.

11:22.175 --> 11:24.659
Don't pass it up.

11:24.659 --> 11:27.262
I know you'd like to kill me.

11:27.262 --> 11:34.159
That's what all you Skags want, isn't it?

11:34.159 --> 11:35.812
Go ahead.

11:36.388 --> 11:41.034
Or maybe you need to finish that drink first.

11:43.842 --> 11:48.718
Excuse me. You think I could get some more coffee before you shoot him?

11:58.320 --> 12:00.010
Who the hell are you?

12:00.010 --> 12:02.382
Name's Archer.

12:04.132 --> 12:13.721
Well, Mr. Archer, you could learn a thing or two about manners.

12:15.966 --> 12:19.466
I don't like being interrupted in the middle of a conversation.

12:19.466 --> 12:20.742
I'll keep that in mind.

12:20.742 --> 12:23.119
Is there a problem here?

12:23.949 --> 12:31.714
I was just having a drink with our friend, Draysik,
and this gentleman decided to butt in.

12:31.714 --> 12:35.014
I saw you this morning at the undertaker's.

12:35.014 --> 12:36.622
What's your business here?

12:36.622 --> 12:39.528
Just passing through town.

12:39.528 --> 12:43.470
This Skag a friend of yours?

12:43.470 --> 12:46.731
I just wanted him to get me a cup of coffee.

12:46.731 --> 12:50.429
It's a little hot for coffee today, don't you think?

12:55.141 --> 12:57.650
Maybe you're right.

13:00.481 --> 13:03.115
It's been a pleasure.

13:10.893 --> 13:12.886
Keep an eye on him.

13:12.886 --> 13:15.350
Make sure he leaves town.

13:21.256 --> 13:26.346
And, uh, Bennings... leave the Skag alone.

13:46.492 --> 13:52.556
I'd estimate this vessel has been here for at least two centuries.

13:52.556 --> 13:55.433
Where you going?

13:55.433 --> 13:57.473
The captain said to learn whatever we could.

13:57.473 --> 13:59.809
He also said to keep a low profile.

13:59.809 --> 14:01.647
I plan to.

14:16.169 --> 14:18.667
Didn't mean to startle you...

14:18.667 --> 14:21.400
What do you want?

14:22.137 --> 14:24.551
My name's Jonathan Archer.

14:24.551 --> 14:28.329
I saw you this morning, paying for that man's casket.

14:28.329 --> 14:31.111
I don't know where you're from, Mr. Archer,

14:31.111 --> 14:34.473
but around here, no one refers to a Skagaran as a "man."

14:34.473 --> 14:36.093
If you'll excuse me.

14:36.093 --> 14:37.670
Can I help you with that?

14:37.670 --> 14:39.794
I'll manage.

14:39.794 --> 14:42.189
It's no trouble.

14:42.189 --> 14:46.067
I'll ask you again... what do you want?

14:46.067 --> 14:48.812
I'd like to learn more about the Skagarans.

14:48.812 --> 14:50.472
Everyone knows about the Skagarans.

14:50.472 --> 14:52.015
There aren't any where I'm from.

14:52.015 --> 14:53.782
And where's that?

14:53.782 --> 14:58.145
Up north... quite a ways.

14:58.145 --> 15:04.152
If certain people had their way, there wouldn't be any around here either.

15:04.152 --> 15:07.344
I heard about what you did in the saloon today.

15:07.344 --> 15:10.515
Deputy Bennings has a nasty temper.

15:10.515 --> 15:14.372
Why would you risk getting thrown in jail-- maybe worse?

15:14.372 --> 15:20.064
I don't think that Skagaran's life is any less valuable than mine.

15:20.064 --> 15:24.597
So what do you want with me?

15:24.597 --> 15:31.173
Well... you are the teacher around here, aren't you?

15:31.173 --> 15:35.557
The first Skagaran I ever saw was today lying in that coffin.

15:35.557 --> 15:44.357
Seems I'd be more likely to get the truth from you than from the men who put him there.

15:44.357 --> 15:49.907
Would you like to meet more of them?

16:33.533 --> 16:36.780
It's all right.

16:58.551 --> 17:00.194
Captain.

17:02.283 --> 17:04.615
Bethany.

17:04.615 --> 17:06.636
These are the friends I told you about.

17:06.636 --> 17:10.186
You're from "up north," too?

17:10.186 --> 17:13.740
That's correct.

17:13.740 --> 17:16.305
The children will be here soon.

17:16.305 --> 17:18.715
You said you wanted to learn something, Mr. Archer.

17:18.715 --> 17:20.953
You're welcome to stay for the lesson.

17:20.953 --> 17:22.707
Thanks.

17:23.921 --> 17:26.559
Kind of late at night to be teaching school.

17:26.559 --> 17:29.979
It's illegal to teach Skagaran.

17:36.672 --> 17:38.036
A ship?

17:38.036 --> 17:40.734
What's left of it.

17:40.734 --> 17:44.139
We found these in the data module.

17:44.139 --> 17:46.288
Go back to Enterprise.
See what you can salvage.

17:46.288 --> 17:49.024
You're not coming with us?

17:50.174 --> 17:53.030
Don't want to miss my first day of school.

18:03.511 --> 18:07.436
Nine times 12... don't forget to carry the one.

18:07.436 --> 18:08.978
Yral.

18:08.978 --> 18:11.936
Nine times 12 equals 108.

18:11.936 --> 18:13.090
That's right.

18:13.090 --> 18:16.462
You're doing very well with your multiplication tables.

18:16.462 --> 18:22.599
Tomorrow night, we'll start with something a little more challenging-- long division.

18:22.599 --> 18:25.692
Kret, collect the slates, please.

18:28.454 --> 18:33.300
I've brought a friend with me who'd like to learn more about your people.

18:33.300 --> 18:39.550
Who can tell Mr. Archer how the humans and the Skagarans came to live together?

18:39.550 --> 18:41.299
Taliya

18:41.299 --> 18:47.179
Our ancestors took the humans from their planet and brought them here.

18:47.179 --> 18:49.127
And why did they do that?

18:49.127 --> 18:51.266
To make them work.

18:51.266 --> 18:55.473
But the humans didn't want to work for the Skagarans, did they?

18:55.473 --> 18:58.410
No, we didn't.

18:59.137 --> 19:03.351
Go on home now. Go on.
It's all right.

19:06.143 --> 19:10.779
I tried to warn you, Bethany-- teaching Skags is a crime.

19:10.779 --> 19:11.732
You know that.

19:11.732 --> 19:13.655
No one is being hurt here.

19:13.655 --> 19:15.213
So you say.

19:15.213 --> 19:17.657
But I'm afraid the law is the law.

19:17.657 --> 19:20.534
I thought you could bend the local ordinances.

19:20.534 --> 19:25.242
That's true... but this is one I have no intention of bending.

19:25.242 --> 19:28.063
Get away from me!

19:37.633 --> 19:40.885
Sheriff gave you a chance to leave town.

19:40.885 --> 19:43.302
You should've taken it.

19:57.532 --> 19:58.763
Get away from there!

19:58.763 --> 20:00.762
Go on, now!

20:04.078 --> 20:05.660
Best I can do.

20:05.660 --> 20:07.564
Thanks.

20:07.564 --> 20:11.436
What's going to happen to you now?

20:11.436 --> 20:12.579
Don't worry.

20:12.579 --> 20:15.850
This isn't the first time the Sheriff and I haven't seen eye to eye.

20:18.110 --> 20:21.867
You didn't get to finish your lesson.

20:21.867 --> 20:24.263
I'd like to hear the rest of it.

20:24.263 --> 20:26.690
You know the story.
Everyone does.

20:26.690 --> 20:29.743
Everyone seems to have their own version.

20:29.743 --> 20:34.458
I'm curious to hear the way you teach it to the Skagarans.

20:34.458 --> 20:40.880
That... wreck at their settlement-- was that their ship?

20:40.880 --> 20:45.778
They used it 300 years ago to go to Earth to bring our ancestors back here.

20:45.778 --> 20:47.295
They were building colonies.

20:47.295 --> 20:48.975
They needed workers.

20:48.975 --> 20:50.675
You mean slaves.

20:50.675 --> 20:55.391
It was a terrible crime.

20:56.651 --> 21:00.366
Tell me about Cooper Smith.

21:00.366 --> 21:04.135
That's where the stories differ somewhat.

21:04.135 --> 21:08.641
To the humans, he's a folk hero-- our liberator.

21:08.641 --> 21:10.790
I'm sure that's what you were taught.

21:10.790 --> 21:15.439
But the Skagarans-- they call him Rokdar.

21:15.439 --> 21:18.143
It means "butcher."

21:18.143 --> 21:21.878
He and his men burned the Skagaran ship, destroyed their weapons.

21:21.878 --> 21:25.776
They murdered most of them--entire families.

21:25.776 --> 21:29.696
Have you heard that version?

21:29.696 --> 21:37.035
Smith wrote the first laws that kept the Skagarans from going to school, owning property...

21:37.035 --> 21:40.357
even marrying.

21:40.357 --> 21:43.171
So they could never enslave the humans again.

21:43.171 --> 21:46.144
That's how they justified it.

21:46.144 --> 21:50.684
Men like Bennings are happy to carry on the tradition.

21:54.688 --> 21:57.420
Sheriff wants to talk to you.

22:26.306 --> 22:28.087
Care for a shave, Mr. Archer?

22:28.087 --> 22:29.674
No, thanks.

22:29.674 --> 22:30.631
You sure?

22:30.631 --> 22:34.958
There's nothing like a barber shave to make a man feel civilized.

22:34.958 --> 22:37.095
I feel civilized enough.

22:37.095 --> 22:39.201
Well, suit yourself.

22:39.201 --> 22:40.229
Thanks, Henry.

22:40.229 --> 22:42.668
Anytime, sheriff.

22:42.668 --> 22:45.822
Have a seat.

22:50.790 --> 22:54.297
Skagaran whiskey.

22:54.297 --> 23:01.037
It's illegal, but I let Henry keep a bottle around for pulling teeth.

23:06.835 --> 23:10.031
Packs a hell of a wallop.

23:17.187 --> 23:21.066
I thought you were heading south to raise bluehorns.

23:21.066 --> 23:22.950
That's the plan.

23:22.950 --> 23:28.250
Then maybe you can tell me why you were out in Skag town in the middle of the night.

23:28.250 --> 23:29.827
Is that a crime?

23:29.827 --> 23:32.765
My deputy says you and Miss Bethany were teaching those children,

23:32.765 --> 23:34.249
and that's a crime.

23:34.249 --> 23:39.884
But if I decided to lynch a Skagaran... that'd be legal?

23:39.884 --> 23:43.676
The law was laid down a long time ago to protect men like you and me.

23:43.676 --> 23:47.509
Protect us from what-- children?

23:47.509 --> 23:52.762
You really want those children to learn how to read, how to do their numbers?

23:52.762 --> 23:57.962
And then maybe they can learn about how they used to be in charge around here,

23:57.962 --> 24:01.057
how they had guns that could kill a man with a beam of light,

24:01.057 --> 24:06.366
and that human beings were nothing but their labor force, their property.

24:06.366 --> 24:09.529
Is that what you want those children to learn, Mr. Archer?

24:09.529 --> 24:12.450
You're judging them on something that happened over 200 years ago.

24:12.450 --> 24:17.373
And it's my job to make sure it never happens again.

24:17.373 --> 24:20.013
Now, I'm not saying it's fair.

24:20.013 --> 24:23.091
It's just the way it's always been.

24:23.091 --> 24:27.917
I expect you to be out of town in an hour.

24:33.698 --> 24:35.115
What's going to happen to Bethany?

24:35.115 --> 24:36.351
She's been warned.

24:36.351 --> 24:37.956
She knew the consequences.

24:37.956 --> 24:40.872
The minimum sentence is ten years.

25:03.045 --> 25:04.311
Archer to Enterprise.

25:04.311 --> 25:05.586
Go ahead, Captain.

25:05.586 --> 25:07.778
Any luck with those data modules?

25:07.778 --> 25:11.550
Several of them were damaged, but we managed to access some of the logs.

25:11.550 --> 25:13.941
I'm still working on the translation, sir.

25:13.941 --> 25:16.407
I'll meet you at the landing coordinates in an hour.

25:16.407 --> 25:19.020
There's something I have to do first.

25:44.565 --> 25:47.768
I was on my way out of town and realized I forgot something.

25:58.705 --> 26:00.348
What are you doing?

26:00.348 --> 26:02.287
It's called a jailbreak where I come from.

26:02.287 --> 26:05.021
It's called that here, too.

26:10.184 --> 26:11.986
Where do you expect me to go?

26:11.986 --> 26:14.150
There are other settlements.

26:14.150 --> 26:15.467
I'm sure they can use a good teacher.

26:15.467 --> 26:16.787
Things won't be any different there.

26:16.787 --> 26:20.661
Maybe not, but you won't be spending ten years in prison.

26:43.427 --> 26:47.012
It was Archer.

26:55.754 --> 26:57.727
They couldn't have gotten far.

26:57.727 --> 27:00.114
Get Nash and Franklin.

27:36.091 --> 27:37.530
Archer to Enterprise.

27:37.530 --> 27:39.790
Lock the transporter on to my position.

27:39.790 --> 27:41.215
There are two of us.

27:41.215 --> 27:43.412
Drop that, whatever it is!

28:16.978 --> 28:19.370
Did anyone see you transport?

28:19.370 --> 28:23.202
I didn't exactly have time to find a secluded spot.

28:23.202 --> 28:25.337
These are volatile and suspicious people.

28:25.337 --> 28:28.322
Your disappearance may have consequences.

28:28.322 --> 28:33.084
I've removed the projectile, but her injuries were extensive.

28:33.084 --> 28:34.712
Will she make it?

28:34.712 --> 28:39.209
I believe so, but there are a few things about her physiology I still don't understand.

28:39.209 --> 28:40.759
What do you mean?

28:40.759 --> 28:43.650
Aren't you familiar with this woman's ancestry?

28:43.650 --> 28:47.148
The cranial genes are recessive, which explains her human appearance.

28:47.148 --> 28:51.227
My guess is, they came from her maternal grandmother.

28:51.227 --> 28:53.617
She's one-quarter Skagaran.

28:55.952 --> 28:58.600
You heard the stories, same as me.

28:58.600 --> 29:02.765
Cooper Smith said the Skags could move through thin air from one place to another.

29:02.765 --> 29:05.224
Maybe you ought to get your eyes checked, Bennings.

29:05.224 --> 29:06.412
Archer's a human.

29:06.412 --> 29:07.482
He's working with them.

29:07.482 --> 29:08.554
You don't know that.

29:08.554 --> 29:12.540
Then what was he doing out in Skag town?

29:12.540 --> 29:15.973
And why'd he stick up for Draysik in the saloon yesterday?

29:15.973 --> 29:18.324
'Cause you were being a horse's ass.

29:18.324 --> 29:24.347
And who was he talking to on that little box he had?

29:24.347 --> 29:26.882
It was the Skags.

29:26.882 --> 29:30.010
They helped him escape.

29:30.010 --> 29:36.664
This is what we were afraid of, Mac, that they'd try to take over again.

29:36.664 --> 29:40.379
It's time to put an end to this.

29:40.379 --> 29:44.446
You have something in mind?

29:44.446 --> 29:50.531
I say we ride out there tonight and burn them out.

29:50.531 --> 29:52.938
I guarantee you, there'll be plenty of volunteers.

29:52.938 --> 29:54.794
Now, you listen to me.

29:54.794 --> 29:56.442
I'm not gonna murder those people

29:56.442 --> 30:00.841
just because some stranger spooked you with a parlor trick.

30:00.841 --> 30:04.076
Now, if I get some proof that the Skagarans are up to something,

30:04.076 --> 30:06.802
I'll take care of it.

30:06.802 --> 30:09.348
You've always been too soft on them, Mac.

30:09.348 --> 30:12.427
And you've always harassed them while I looked the other way.

30:12.427 --> 30:16.645
And that's gonna change, right now.

30:16.645 --> 30:22.354
As long as you work for me, our job is to enforce the law.

30:22.354 --> 30:25.488
Understood?

30:26.684 --> 30:29.262
Understood.

30:45.062 --> 30:48.201
The story she told you was basically true, Captain.

30:48.201 --> 30:53.261
The Skagaran ship brought them here to provide labor for a colony they were trying to establish.

30:53.261 --> 30:56.688
They apparently found the humans suited to survive in this environment.

30:56.688 --> 30:58.980
There are a lot of reports of disciplinary problems,

30:58.980 --> 31:04.711
and then six months after they arrived, the logs end.

31:04.711 --> 31:07.498
They kidnapped the wrong people.

31:07.498 --> 31:09.490
So, what do we do?

31:09.490 --> 31:13.035
They're humans-- we can't just leave them here.

31:13.035 --> 31:17.423
We can't transport 6,000 people back to Earth.

31:17.423 --> 31:21.538
Once we've dealt with the Xindi, we'll come back here...

31:21.538 --> 31:24.558
do what we can to help them.

31:24.558 --> 31:27.010
For now...

31:27.010 --> 31:31.436
they deserve to know that Earth hasn't abandoned them.

32:34.347 --> 32:36.609
We need to talk.

32:38.353 --> 32:40.117
And you were born there?

32:40.117 --> 32:43.145
I was born in upstate New York.

32:43.145 --> 32:46.881
Spent most of my adult life in San Francisco, though.

32:46.881 --> 32:49.042
You've heard of San Francisco?

32:49.042 --> 32:52.110
Pacific Coast.

32:52.110 --> 32:54.473
Why didn't you tell us who you were?

32:54.473 --> 32:57.977
I wasn't sure how you'd react.

32:57.977 --> 33:00.977
We thought we'd better get the lay of the land first.

33:00.977 --> 33:03.746
Well, I can't say I blame you.

33:03.746 --> 33:07.572
Part of me never believed Earth even existed.

33:07.572 --> 33:09.749
I thought it was something people made up

33:09.749 --> 33:13.322
'cause they couldn't stand living here.

33:13.322 --> 33:16.422
You taking us back?

33:16.422 --> 33:18.299
We can't.

33:18.299 --> 33:20.405
Not right now.

33:20.405 --> 33:22.950
Anyway, our ship isn't big enough.

33:22.950 --> 33:27.857
but someday, we'll come back for you.

33:28.922 --> 33:33.311
You... you realize...

33:33.311 --> 33:35.983
it's not the same world your ancestors left.

33:35.983 --> 33:37.624
A lot's changed in 300 years.

33:37.624 --> 33:39.452
You're telling me.

33:39.452 --> 33:44.771
We've moved past things like intolerance... prejudice.

33:44.771 --> 33:48.455
The Skagarans abducted my ancestors, Captain.

33:48.455 --> 33:50.614
Turned them into slaves.

33:50.614 --> 33:52.776
That was a long time ago.

33:52.776 --> 33:54.405
Well, we tend to have a long memory

33:54.405 --> 33:57.575
when it comes to that sort of thing.

34:01.746 --> 34:04.459
The captain's been in there quite a while.

34:04.459 --> 34:07.245
I imagine the sheriff has a lot of questions.

34:07.245 --> 34:08.552
Yeah.

34:08.552 --> 34:10.481
We did what we had to do.

34:10.481 --> 34:14.507
I understand, but if you do make it back to Earth,

34:14.507 --> 34:19.059
you're going to have to leave all that behind.

34:36.966 --> 34:38.839
It's all right.

34:38.839 --> 34:42.621
These folks aren't gonna hurt anybody.

34:42.621 --> 34:45.614
This is my first officer, T'Pol.

34:45.614 --> 34:47.670
She's from a planet called Vulcan.

34:47.670 --> 34:48.748
Pleased to meet you.

34:48.748 --> 34:49.335
Ma'am.

34:49.335 --> 34:52.279
Dr. Phlox reports that his patient is doing much better.

34:52.279 --> 34:53.867
Good.

34:53.867 --> 34:56.516
I thought we'd bring Mr. MacReady...

35:02.566 --> 35:05.478
Have your men drop those guns.

35:05.478 --> 35:07.705
Let's talk this through, Bennings!

35:07.705 --> 35:12.150
I never was one for talking.

35:18.879 --> 35:21.441
Trust me. You don't wanna pick a fight with us, Deputy.

35:21.441 --> 35:24.684
Should've thought of that before you threw in with the Skags.

35:24.684 --> 35:26.623
We're not taking sides here.

35:26.623 --> 35:29.542
Then where'd you get that machine? and those weapons?

35:29.542 --> 35:32.190
These people are from Earth, Bennings.

35:32.190 --> 35:34.448
Earth?

35:34.448 --> 35:35.807
You're lying.

35:35.807 --> 35:37.675
I can prove it you.

35:37.675 --> 35:39.808
Just give me a chance.

36:18.606 --> 36:20.193
Go.

36:37.075 --> 36:38.760
Lay down some fire!

38:09.720 --> 38:14.728
Stay back!
I'll kill her.

38:29.889 --> 38:31.379
Secure the area.

38:31.379 --> 38:32.977
Find the captain.

39:26.994 --> 39:31.630
We're up too high to see it, but your town is down there.

39:32.529 --> 39:36.983
Toward the right edge of that mountain range.

39:37.790 --> 39:39.800
How you feeling?

39:39.800 --> 39:42.546
I feel fine.

39:42.546 --> 39:44.416
Not even a scar.

39:44.416 --> 39:49.232
Dr. Phlox does excellent work.

39:50.849 --> 39:55.432
You must think we're barbaric.

39:55.432 --> 39:59.437
All the things humanity's accomplished-- building ships like this,

39:59.437 --> 40:02.630
traveling to other worlds--

40:02.630 --> 40:07.086
and we're still down there shooting each other.

40:07.086 --> 40:12.128
The progress on Earth, it didn't happen overnight.

40:12.128 --> 40:14.535
But it was progress, all the same.

40:14.535 --> 40:16.610
You've managed to change.

40:16.610 --> 40:18.998
We haven't.

40:18.998 --> 40:23.197
Even if you could take us back, I don't think we're ready.

40:23.997 --> 40:28.933
It may be awhile before we're able to start sending ships here.

40:28.933 --> 40:30.968
My guess is...

40:30.968 --> 40:36.382
by the time they arrive, they'll find things have changed.

40:36.382 --> 40:38.117
I think you're giving us too much credit.

40:38.117 --> 40:39.568
It's happening already.

40:39.568 --> 40:41.188
I spoke with MacReady.

40:41.188 --> 40:45.371
He agrees that, in light of recent events,

40:45.371 --> 40:49.756
some of your laws might be a little outdated.

41:00.138 --> 41:03.235
Before people could travel through space to other planets,

41:03.235 --> 41:05.936
they had to get off the ground first.

41:05.936 --> 41:09.988
Almost 40 years after my human ancestors left Earth,

41:09.988 --> 41:16.864
two brothers from Ohio became the first human beings to build a successful flying machine.

41:16.864 --> 41:22.519
Their names were Orville and Wilbur Wright.

41:22.519 --> 41:25.247
Would anyone like to see a picture of their airplane?

41:25.247 --> 41:26.613
Me! Yes! Uh-huh! I do!

41:26.613 --> 41:27.998
Oh, you all would.

41:27.998 --> 41:29.693
Well, here it is, right here.

41:29.693 --> 41:31.787
And you can see, here's Orville Wright,

41:31.787 --> 41:34.459
and his brother Wilbur is flying the plane.

41:34.459 --> 41:37.129
Now, this is a machine that actually enables them

41:37.129 --> 41:39.747
to get all the way off the ground and later on,
