<i>Hurricane Vera</i>

00:58.475 --> 01:00.727

and strengthening.</i>

01:00.811 --> 01:03.772
<i>A lot of damage is expected,
especially from the winds...</i>

01:03.856 --> 01:05.607
<i>...is announcing that the trial</i>

01:05.691 --> 01:07.734
<i>against Los Urabenos drug cartel</i>

01:07.818 --> 01:09.611
<i>has been postponed
due to the weather...</i>

01:09.695 --> 01:11.822
<i>The case against
the Colombian drug cartel</i>

01:11.905 --> 01:14.116
<i>may be Hurricane Vera's
first casualty.</i>

01:14.199 --> 01:16.451
<i>Courts, city officials,
all being sent home...</i>

01:16.535 --> 01:17.661
<i>Please follow</i>

01:17.744 --> 01:19.621
<i>emergency evacuation
instructions.</i>

01:19.705 --> 01:20.747
<i>If unable to shelter in...</i>

01:20.831 --> 01:22.583
<i>Moving fast and expected to be</i>

01:22.666 --> 01:25.043
<i>through the D.C. Metropolitan
area in the next hour.</i>

01:25.127 --> 01:26.837
<i>Don't be fooled by clear sky...</i>

01:26.920 --> 01:29.256
<i>Hurricane Vera,
currently a Category Four storm</i>

01:29.339 --> 01:30.340
<i>and strengthening.</i>

01:30.424 --> 01:32.926
<i>Catastrophic wind damage
is expected.</i>

01:33.010 --> 01:35.596
<i>Mandatory evacuations
have been in effect</i>

01:35.679 --> 01:37.264
<i>but that window
is already closing</i>

01:37.347 --> 01:39.391
{\an8}<i>as the storm
is about to make landfall</i>

01:39.474 --> 01:41.393
{\an8}<i>and the outer bands
are already here</i>

01:41.476 --> 01:43.645
{\an8}<i>reminding so many
of Hurricane Sandy</i>

01:43.729 --> 01:45.147
{\an8}<i>a few years back.</i>

01:45.230 --> 01:48.317
{\an8}<i>The D.C. and Virginia area
directly in the crosshairs.</i>

02:24.520 --> 02:25.938
{\an8}Let's tie this bird down.

02:26.021 --> 02:27.606
{\an8}They're shutting down
the airport.

02:28.106 --> 02:29.816
{\an8}Let's go, let's go, let's go.

02:30.526 --> 02:32.027
{\an8}<i>Rapido, rapido, rapido.</i>

02:36.573 --> 02:37.658
{\an8}Everybody in.

03:01.640 --> 03:04.101
{\an8}<i>A very
dangerous situation right now.</i>

03:04.184 --> 03:05.394
<i>If you look behind me</i>

03:05.477 --> 03:07.855
<i>you can see
what we're seeing now</i>

03:07.938 --> 03:09.273
<i>streets practically empty.</i>

03:10.065 --> 03:13.110
<i>Everyone who was supposed
to evacuate has done so</i>

03:13.193 --> 03:14.278
<i>for the most part.</i>

03:15.571 --> 03:17.698
<i>We're looking
at a strong Category Four</i>

03:17.781 --> 03:18.740
<i>at landfall, so...</i>

03:18.824 --> 03:19.992
Can we go over this?

03:20.075 --> 03:22.369
<i>A very
dangerous situation right now.</i>

03:26.665 --> 03:28.750
I just wanna make sure
we have the correct info

03:28.834 --> 03:29.960
for your testimony.

03:38.051 --> 03:39.052
OK.

03:43.140 --> 03:46.101
Your work with the cartels
started five years ago?

03:47.561 --> 03:48.478
Six.

03:50.314 --> 03:52.983
So, our sources tell us that
they recently moved their money

03:53.066 --> 03:54.693
into a cryptocurrency.

03:55.777 --> 03:57.487
Do you know anything about that?

04:05.454 --> 04:06.747
And the flight?

04:07.331 --> 04:08.832
They landed. They're fine.

04:09.917 --> 04:11.585
They got in
just before the storm.

04:12.544 --> 04:13.712
They should be here soon.

04:18.759 --> 04:19.968
They're all I have.

04:21.470 --> 04:24.348
Amelia and her father.
You understand?

04:25.307 --> 04:27.309
I need to know
that they will be safe.

04:28.477 --> 04:29.853
I will testify...

04:31.480 --> 04:33.148
but I want it in the papers.

04:33.565 --> 04:34.525
Promise me

04:35.275 --> 04:38.070
that we will be protected
here in the US

04:38.904 --> 04:40.197
not in Colombia.

04:42.741 --> 04:45.369
We can't go back there.
It's not safe.

04:45.994 --> 04:48.372
You don't know what
they've done to my family there.

04:49.790 --> 04:50.958
Promise me.

04:51.041 --> 04:52.000
Yes.

04:52.584 --> 04:54.670
It's in the witness
protection agreement.

04:54.753 --> 04:57.548
You have nothing to worry about.
I promise you.

05:11.603 --> 05:12.980
Not too far now.

05:13.522 --> 05:15.357
A few more miles,
we'll be at the safe house.

05:39.298 --> 05:40.424
OK, got 'em.

05:41.091 --> 05:42.551
<i>Heading south on Mission.</i>

05:43.510 --> 05:46.263
OK?

06:28.889 --> 06:31.308
- You guys alright?
- Everybody alright in the back?

06:31.391 --> 06:33.477
- Uh-huh.
- I'm good.

06:52.871 --> 06:54.873
I'm hit.

06:54.957 --> 06:56.458
How bad?

07:06.051 --> 07:07.219
Don't worry about me.

07:08.178 --> 07:09.429
Protect the package.

07:16.228 --> 07:18.438
Give me your hand.

07:56.268 --> 07:57.269
Stay down!

07:59.271 --> 08:00.147
Go!

08:11.700 --> 08:13.410
Get low! Stay low!
Get in, get in, get in!

08:29.176 --> 08:31.303
Calm. Stay calm.

08:43.649 --> 08:44.942
What are you looking for?

08:45.025 --> 08:47.319
I thought we hit them.
They're around here somewhere.

08:47.402 --> 08:48.779
They're not here.

08:49.863 --> 08:51.281
Let's get out of here, man!

08:51.865 --> 08:53.784
Agent Armstrong, you copy?

08:54.493 --> 08:55.619
This is Agent Bennett.

08:55.702 --> 08:57.746
<i>Do you copy?</i>

08:57.829 --> 08:59.665
<i>This is Armstrong.</i>

08:59.748 --> 09:01.542
<i>What's your status,
Agent Bennett?</i>

09:01.625 --> 09:03.961
<i>We have the girl and her dad.</i>

09:04.044 --> 09:05.671
<i>We've commandeered
an</i>.

09:05.754 --> 09:06.797
<i>Headed to...</i>

09:06.964 --> 09:08.966
<i>to rendezvous point Nakatomi.</i>

09:10.425 --> 09:11.885
<i>West on Hamel.</i>

09:11.969 --> 09:13.178
<i>ETA ten minutes.</i>

09:13.262 --> 09:14.972
You stay here, if they come!

09:15.055 --> 09:17.307
Where are you going?

09:24.898 --> 09:26.900
<i>Evacuation
orders have gone out...</i>

09:28.068 --> 09:30.237
Yes, no, I know it's a lot
of money I'm asking for

09:30.320 --> 09:31.697
but you know I'm good for it.

09:32.948 --> 09:33.866
Come on, Don

09:33.949 --> 09:35.826
you've been servicing our loan
since my dad...

09:37.786 --> 09:38.704
Yes.

09:38.787 --> 09:41.081
Yes, no, I know my credit rating
is not great right now

09:41.164 --> 09:43.959
but you know it was the divorce
that caused that.

09:45.252 --> 09:46.378
Let me ask you one thing.

09:46.461 --> 09:48.213
Would you even consi...

09:48.297 --> 09:49.381
Hello?

10:13.697 --> 10:14.781
Linda!

10:15.657 --> 10:17.284
Taylor, where have you been?

10:17.367 --> 10:19.369
They're freaking out.

10:19.453 --> 10:21.455
Who turned the fire alarm on?

10:21.538 --> 10:22.581
Who do you think?

10:23.081 --> 10:25.542
Fire alarms are not
for fire emergencies only.

10:25.626 --> 10:27.961
They can be used
in case of any emergency

10:28.045 --> 10:29.171
to notify the proper...

10:29.254 --> 10:31.089
OK. OK, Arthur, we got it.

10:31.173 --> 10:32.090
Thank you.

10:32.549 --> 10:34.092
Any word on the county van?

10:34.176 --> 10:35.177
Can't reach 'em.

10:36.220 --> 10:37.262
You're kidding.

10:37.346 --> 10:39.348
They're supposed to check
on our pick-up an hour ago.

10:39.431 --> 10:42.017
- Phones are down.
- Ugh! Crap!

10:42.100 --> 10:43.560
They're late. Where are they?

10:44.645 --> 10:46.313
We've got to get
everyone out of here.

10:46.980 --> 10:48.106
Can you try the landline?

10:48.190 --> 10:51.026
- I tried it. It's out too.
- The landline?

10:51.109 --> 10:53.153
Well, not because of the storm.

10:57.366 --> 10:59.326
I can't believe they shut us off
in an emergency.

10:59.409 --> 11:00.869
It's a freaking hurricane.

11:02.663 --> 11:04.790
I take it the call with Don
didn't go well?

11:06.375 --> 11:07.709
I think this is finally it.

11:08.627 --> 11:10.671
Come on, don't give up so easy.

11:10.754 --> 11:12.381
You promised him.

11:13.048 --> 11:14.800
Well, my dad
was a big dreamer, OK?

11:14.883 --> 11:16.051
I'm a realist.

11:16.593 --> 11:18.178
I can't save everybody.

11:18.262 --> 11:19.972
You know,
I did everything I could.

11:21.056 --> 11:22.391
This is it, Linda.

11:24.059 --> 11:25.102
Where is everyone?

11:26.436 --> 11:27.437
I'm here!

11:58.552 --> 11:59.553
Rose?

12:33.587 --> 12:34.505
Ida?

12:39.885 --> 12:41.428
Any... Anything on the vans yet?

12:41.512 --> 12:44.223
Lines are still dead.
What are we gonna do?

12:52.022 --> 12:56.193
<i>Again, Hurricane Vera, currently
a Category Four storm and...</i>

12:56.276 --> 12:58.695
Oh, is Fonzy cooking again?

12:58.779 --> 13:01.073
I'm not gonna just stand here
and listen to this guy.

13:01.823 --> 13:04.368
Who do you think you are,
bossing us around?

13:04.451 --> 13:05.619
He's a colonel.

13:06.286 --> 13:07.371
Lieutenant Colonel.

13:07.788 --> 13:08.914
Yeah, right.

13:09.289 --> 13:10.999
"Colonel", with air quotes.

13:11.500 --> 13:13.502
See? Air quotes.

13:13.585 --> 13:15.462
Hey. Hey.
What's going on in here?

13:16.547 --> 13:19.091
- And why is the food out, Fonzy?
- I'm hungry.

13:19.716 --> 13:20.759
You're a stress eater.

13:20.843 --> 13:22.219
Yeah, and don't think
we don't know

13:22.302 --> 13:23.679
you've been cooking
in your room.

13:24.513 --> 13:25.681
Yeah. So?

13:26.932 --> 13:28.308
You have anger issues, too.

13:28.392 --> 13:29.560
Yeah, but...

13:30.352 --> 13:32.354
I'm working on it.

13:34.231 --> 13:35.607
You gotta tell this guy, T

13:35.691 --> 13:37.401
we got a van coming
to pick us up.

13:37.484 --> 13:40.362
He says we have to stay here
and shelter.

13:40.445 --> 13:42.281
Yeah, shelter in place.

13:42.364 --> 13:44.408
And it's not me, it's the news.

13:44.491 --> 13:46.368
It's too dangerous
to go out there anyway.

13:46.451 --> 13:48.161
Look, if you have
a problem with it

13:48.245 --> 13:49.872
you can take it up
with the authorities.

13:50.664 --> 13:53.876
You want us to stay here
and get blown to smithereens?

13:54.918 --> 13:56.128
You tell him, T.

13:58.380 --> 14:00.924
Well, the truth is, everyone

14:01.008 --> 14:02.801
I'm not sure
the evacuation van's coming.

14:02.885 --> 14:05.262
Oh, good Lord.

14:05.345 --> 14:07.890
Hold on!
Hold on, everyone. Hold on.

14:08.849 --> 14:11.143
Are you sure that's what you
heard about shelter in place?

14:11.226 --> 14:13.729
Yeah, Sheriff Rightmire
held a press conference

14:13.812 --> 14:16.565
said everyone in the county
who hasn't already evacuated

14:16.648 --> 14:18.400
is to shelter in place.

14:18.483 --> 14:19.693
We're not to leave.

14:19.776 --> 14:21.403
Is that what everyone heard?

14:22.070 --> 14:23.238
I heard it.

14:23.822 --> 14:24.907
I heard it, too.

14:26.033 --> 14:27.034
OK. Alright.

14:27.117 --> 14:28.994
- Well, shelter in place it is.
- Oh.

14:29.077 --> 14:31.788
Let's get everyone back
to their rooms for now, OK?

14:31.872 --> 14:34.499
Mm. She don't look good to me.

14:34.583 --> 14:35.876
Tired.

14:35.959 --> 14:38.587
I'll get the candles out
in case the power goes out.

14:40.088 --> 14:42.090
It'll be romantic. Eh, Rosie?

14:43.175 --> 14:45.260
You keep your candles
to yourself.

14:46.178 --> 14:47.971
Mm.

14:53.227 --> 14:54.228
Stay down.

15:06.323 --> 15:07.574
Let me take a look at that.

15:08.825 --> 15:10.827
You need to put pressure
on that. Hold tight.

15:13.455 --> 15:15.165
We gotta leave. Let's go.

15:21.755 --> 15:22.881
Keep low. Keep low.

15:28.554 --> 15:30.389
Uh... Back to your room, please.

15:30.472 --> 15:31.723
Oh, come on, T.

15:32.516 --> 15:34.101
Thank you.

15:35.561 --> 15:37.813
All of you, just for now,
please...

15:44.152 --> 15:45.320
Ooh!

15:50.951 --> 15:51.827
Wiggle it.

15:52.744 --> 15:53.996
There's a trick to it.

15:54.079 --> 15:56.164
Oh, I always forget that.

15:59.418 --> 16:00.419
OK.

16:07.217 --> 16:09.678
How do you always
stay so calm in all of this?

16:10.762 --> 16:13.015
I've been through
a few storms before.

16:13.640 --> 16:15.642
It'll be alright.

16:16.435 --> 16:18.228
Alright...

16:19.146 --> 16:21.815
If the power goes out,
the monitor has a backup battery

16:21.899 --> 16:22.774
and that'll...

16:22.858 --> 16:25.027
That'll kick in, OK?
So, just leave that on.

16:25.569 --> 16:28.947
How did I live 93 years
without that thing?

16:30.657 --> 16:33.493
That's not what's keeping
my heart going, honey.

16:33.577 --> 16:35.621
Yeah, well...

16:37.789 --> 16:41.293
I know it's hard times
here right now.

16:46.465 --> 16:50.302
Don't worry about your life,
what you will eat or drink.

16:51.094 --> 16:53.222
Look at the birds of the air.

16:53.305 --> 16:55.182
They neither sow nor reap

16:55.807 --> 16:58.185
and yet,
your heavenly Father feeds them.

16:59.811 --> 17:00.854
Don't worry.

17:02.481 --> 17:03.690
He'll provide.

17:06.944 --> 17:08.444
I wish I could believe that.

17:09.029 --> 17:12.156
You will. Just like your father.

17:18.329 --> 17:20.415
Do you want me
to help you get back into bed?

17:20.499 --> 17:21.665
No. I'm fine.

18:56.887 --> 18:58.180
No. No, thanks.

19:01.350 --> 19:02.351
Ladies...

19:03.477 --> 19:05.187
No. Go sit down.

19:08.774 --> 19:11.443
Oh, let me help you with that.

19:13.028 --> 19:13.987
Sorry.

19:14.071 --> 19:16.240
They wanted to be together.
It's hard to say no.

19:18.200 --> 19:20.410
Although, technically,
Taylor's right.

19:20.494 --> 19:22.746
FEMA recommends
staying in interior rooms

19:22.829 --> 19:24.206
in situations like this.

19:24.915 --> 19:26.124
Whatever, nerd.

19:27.167 --> 19:30.963
I'm just saying, don't blame me
if we all get buried in debris.

19:31.380 --> 19:32.714
Oh, Arthur!

19:34.883 --> 19:35.968
Just take them all.

19:36.927 --> 19:38.512
Put us all out of our misery.

19:39.263 --> 19:41.348
Oh, no. Today's Tuesday only.

19:41.431 --> 19:44.810
You do not want to combine
Tuesday and Wednesday, trust me.

19:45.394 --> 19:48.522
Mixing days equals purple haze.

19:48.605 --> 19:50.691
Alright.
Alright, kids, that's enough.

19:52.234 --> 19:55.279
We can stay in here. Alright?
Just for now though.

19:56.154 --> 19:58.323
- How's she doing?
- We're hanging in there.

20:14.590 --> 20:15.799
DEA.

20:15.883 --> 20:17.718
Can we come in, please?
Need help.

20:24.850 --> 20:26.185
Come on in, sweetie.

20:32.065 --> 20:33.400
Cole Bennett, DEA.

20:33.483 --> 20:35.986
Hi, I'm Taylor Ward.
I'm the owner of this place.

20:37.613 --> 20:39.156
What happened? Is he hurt?

20:40.699 --> 20:41.867
Is this is a medical facility?

20:42.534 --> 20:44.703
- Assisted living.
- What's going on?

20:45.495 --> 20:47.831
Linda, can you please
grab them some towels?

20:49.208 --> 20:52.419
- Do you have a doctor here?
- I'm a nurse. No doctor, no.

20:53.921 --> 20:56.673
- What happened?
- We've been in a collision.

20:56.757 --> 20:58.217
These people
are under my protection

20:58.300 --> 21:00.135
as possible witnesses
in a federal trial.

21:01.136 --> 21:03.347
There's a FEMA command post
about eight blocks away.

21:03.430 --> 21:04.389
The phones are dead.

21:04.473 --> 21:06.058
I've gotta make it
there on foot.

21:07.017 --> 21:08.268
Can I leave them in your care?

21:11.230 --> 21:14.399
- Ma'am?
- Yeah. Of course, yes. Yes.

21:14.483 --> 21:15.943
Taylor, what's going on?

21:16.026 --> 21:19.363
Can you prep room 203, please?
We'll put them up there.

21:19.446 --> 21:20.572
You'll be OK.

21:21.198 --> 21:23.242
Like I said, we're
assisted living. I'm not...

21:23.325 --> 21:25.285
I'm not sure I can help
but I'll do whatever I can.

21:25.869 --> 21:28.038
Appreciate it.
You'll be alright here.

21:28.121 --> 21:29.206
Take care of your father.

21:33.210 --> 21:35.170
Thank you.

22:03.448 --> 22:04.867
Just come right in here.

22:06.743 --> 22:08.829
There we go.

22:10.289 --> 22:11.498
Alright...

22:12.457 --> 22:15.002
Let's take a...

22:17.045 --> 22:19.173
I need to take a look if
I'm gonna be able to help you.

22:21.842 --> 22:22.801
What happened?

22:23.886 --> 22:25.012
<i>Que paso?</i>

22:27.806 --> 22:29.141
<i>Hablar Inglés?</i>

22:30.100 --> 22:31.268
Yes.

22:33.562 --> 22:34.605
What's your name?

22:35.272 --> 22:36.607
He is Francisco.

22:37.649 --> 22:38.734
I am Amelia.

22:40.444 --> 22:41.320
Taylor.

22:44.114 --> 22:45.365
Let me take a look.

22:56.210 --> 22:57.377
OK.

23:04.885 --> 23:07.596
<i>...we have debris
flying everywhere.</i>

23:08.222 --> 23:12.267
<i>We have a hubcap.
I would definitely recommend...</i>

23:35.832 --> 23:37.292
This is a bullet wound.

23:37.376 --> 23:39.086
I'm not equipped
to take this out here, OK?

23:39.169 --> 23:40.629
I'm gonna dress it
as best as I can

23:40.712 --> 23:42.130
until I can get you
to a hospital.

23:42.214 --> 23:45.509
- Did you get through with 911?
- No, the storm, it's...

23:46.593 --> 23:47.970
I need gauze and supplies.

23:48.053 --> 23:49.179
We're out of gauze.

23:49.263 --> 23:50.430
You're kidding me.

23:51.515 --> 23:53.517
Alright, here,
put some pressure on that.

23:53.600 --> 23:55.060
Let's go take a look, alright?

23:56.728 --> 23:57.729
Come on.

24:02.109 --> 24:04.444
He went up the road.

24:11.493 --> 24:12.452
From your mama.

24:13.996 --> 24:15.038
Take it.

24:30.554 --> 24:31.471
Keep it...

24:32.681 --> 24:33.974
always.

24:34.600 --> 24:35.559
No...

24:39.771 --> 24:41.940
Little sparrow.

24:45.360 --> 24:48.280
Don't worry. It will be alright.

24:50.866 --> 24:51.825
Keep it.

24:52.409 --> 24:53.827
<i>Es muy importante.</i>

24:55.787 --> 24:57.039
<i>Prometeme.</i>

24:58.457 --> 24:59.583
Promise me.

25:06.465 --> 25:07.633
<i>Prometeme.</i>

25:09.635 --> 25:11.929
I promise. I will.

25:25.400 --> 25:28.320
OK, let's see what
we can do here, huh?

25:29.071 --> 25:30.113
OK.

25:34.493 --> 25:35.577
We are followed.

25:36.828 --> 25:38.288
Being followed? By who?

25:39.373 --> 25:40.374
Men.

25:41.708 --> 25:42.709
Bad men.

25:43.210 --> 25:44.419
<i>Sicarios.</i>

25:46.588 --> 25:48.340
OK, let me take a look at this.

25:51.760 --> 25:54.263
He's bleeding out.

25:55.639 --> 25:56.890
He's bleeding out. Linda!

25:56.974 --> 25:59.768
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Shh.

25:59.852 --> 26:02.646
It's OK. Amelia, help me
calm him down, sweetheart.

26:02.729 --> 26:05.274
It's OK. It's OK.

26:05.357 --> 26:06.358
It's OK.

26:22.499 --> 26:23.834
What was that?

26:24.668 --> 26:26.920
I hope that wasn't a branch
going through a window.

26:35.137 --> 26:36.305
Linda!

26:41.852 --> 26:42.936
That was no branch.

26:44.229 --> 26:46.440
Amelia, I want you
to do me a favour here.

26:46.523 --> 26:47.482
Give me your hands.

26:47.566 --> 26:49.443
I want you to put a lot
of pressure on there, OK?

26:49.526 --> 26:50.819
More than you think you should.

26:50.903 --> 26:52.946
I'm gonna be back
as soon as I can.

26:54.198 --> 26:55.699
OK, lock this door behind me

26:55.782 --> 26:57.326
and then put the pressure
back on, OK?

26:59.578 --> 27:01.163
Papa.

27:02.331 --> 27:03.290
Papa.

27:08.754 --> 27:09.713
Stay right there.

27:09.796 --> 27:11.507
- OK.
- You in charge here?

27:12.007 --> 27:13.175
Yes.

27:13.258 --> 27:14.760
There a man
and a little girl here?

27:17.679 --> 27:19.848
A man and a little girl here?

27:20.974 --> 27:21.975
Huh?

27:29.900 --> 27:31.151
Told you we hit them.

27:32.986 --> 27:34.321
- I'm gonna ask you...
- No!

27:34.404 --> 27:36.657
One last time.

27:37.449 --> 27:40.244
Is there a man...

27:40.327 --> 27:41.912
...and a little girl here?

27:43.288 --> 27:45.207
You have two seconds!

27:45.290 --> 27:47.000
OK! Please! Please!

27:47.960 --> 27:49.878
OK. OK, come with me.

27:50.546 --> 27:52.005
Walk.

27:52.089 --> 27:53.882
- Walk!
- OK! OK!

27:56.468 --> 27:57.469
Hey!

28:04.560 --> 28:05.853
- Hurry up.
- OK.

28:13.110 --> 28:14.444
- Move.
- OK.

28:17.072 --> 28:18.073
Faster.

28:18.448 --> 28:19.992
Hey, hey...

28:26.373 --> 28:28.667
Hey, hey, look.

28:29.126 --> 28:31.920
I want the man
and the girl, not you.

28:32.921 --> 28:33.881
It's OK.

28:34.840 --> 28:36.133
- OK.
- Walk.

28:45.475 --> 28:46.727
Hey, hey, hey!

28:51.106 --> 28:52.191
What's in here?

28:52.941 --> 28:54.610
- It's just a guest room.
- Shh!

28:56.737 --> 28:58.030
Are they armed?

28:59.239 --> 29:00.741
I don't know.

29:16.465 --> 29:17.466
Where are they?

29:17.549 --> 29:19.051
- I don't know.
- Were they in there?

29:19.635 --> 29:21.303
- Were they...
- Yes, they were. Yes.

29:23.680 --> 29:24.723
Shh.

29:26.725 --> 29:28.268
Stay with me. Come on.

29:35.651 --> 29:36.818
What's in there?

29:36.902 --> 29:38.362
Nothing.
It's just a laundry room.

29:38.445 --> 29:41.281
Knock on the door and tell them
it's you. Tell them to open up.

29:44.576 --> 29:45.744
Hello, it's me.

29:49.122 --> 29:50.457
Can you open the door?

29:53.126 --> 29:54.253
Move away!

30:11.728 --> 30:13.981
Ay, <i>pobrecito.</i>

30:15.774 --> 30:17.484
You don't look good, Paisa.

30:18.861 --> 30:20.070
Let's do this quick.

30:21.572 --> 30:22.781
Where's the code?

30:24.032 --> 30:25.367
Where's the code?

30:26.159 --> 30:29.246
Is it on a chip or something?
Flash drive? Something?

30:31.081 --> 30:32.040
Hey.

30:32.916 --> 30:35.961
Hey, hey, hey.

30:36.044 --> 30:37.296
Wake up.

30:37.379 --> 30:39.339
Where is it?

30:39.423 --> 30:42.384
Hey, hey, hey!
Look. Look at me. Look!

30:43.802 --> 30:46.180
Is it... Is it in here? Huh?

30:57.649 --> 30:59.776
Hey, hey. <i>Dígame.</i>
Tell me, where is it?

30:59.860 --> 31:01.653
Or I'll do to you
what I did to your brother.

31:01.737 --> 31:04.198
<i>Dígame. Dígame,</i> eh?

31:07.242 --> 31:09.244
You think you could
turn your back on us, huh?

31:09.328 --> 31:10.537
You think these Americans

31:10.621 --> 31:12.122
are gonna protect you
more than me?

31:15.083 --> 31:16.460
Hey, hey.

31:16.543 --> 31:18.670
Hey, look, look, look...

31:19.421 --> 31:21.507
I don't care
if your wife testifies.

31:22.132 --> 31:23.175
I don't care.

31:23.842 --> 31:25.969
That's my uncle's business. Hmm?

31:26.053 --> 31:30.140
He sent us here to take you out,
but forget him.

31:30.224 --> 31:32.059
He's not as considerate as I am.

31:33.352 --> 31:35.979
Look, look, look, look...

31:36.063 --> 31:38.398
You give me the code,
we split it.

31:40.776 --> 31:42.694
We do our own thing. Hmm?

31:43.820 --> 31:45.447
I'll give you
as much as you want.

31:45.948 --> 31:49.243
You, your family, you walk.

31:50.285 --> 31:52.621
Hey, you give me that code
and we're rich.

31:52.704 --> 31:54.122
We're very rich, my man.

31:54.206 --> 31:56.917
Hey, hey...

31:57.668 --> 31:58.919
I just need that code.

31:59.461 --> 32:01.004
You... You have it?

32:01.839 --> 32:04.591
You... Your daughter has it?

32:11.265 --> 32:12.683
Think you can turn
your back on me?

32:12.766 --> 32:15.060
Hey, hey, hey!

32:15.143 --> 32:16.103
Please, stop.

32:16.186 --> 32:17.896
Please.
He needs medical attention.

32:18.522 --> 32:19.398
What do you know?

32:19.481 --> 32:20.691
I don't know anything, I swear.

32:20.774 --> 32:22.860
- They gave it to you?
- They didn't give me anything.

32:22.943 --> 32:24.194
I swear.

32:24.570 --> 32:26.488
Hey, hey, hey!
Where's the money?

32:26.572 --> 32:28.198
Where's the money?

32:28.282 --> 32:30.659
Tell me, where's the money?
Where's the money, huh?

32:30.742 --> 32:31.994
Where's the money?

32:32.077 --> 32:33.745
Hey! Hey!

32:34.746 --> 32:36.290
Hey, hey.

32:36.373 --> 32:37.958
Hey, wh... where's the money?

32:38.041 --> 32:39.543
Hey, where's the money?

32:43.672 --> 32:44.673
Where's the girl?

32:44.756 --> 32:46.800
I don't... I don't know.

32:47.885 --> 32:50.137
- Wait! Wait.
- What?

32:51.138 --> 32:53.557
Wait. You want a flash drive
or something, right?

32:53.640 --> 32:55.100
If it's that,
I... I have a place...

32:55.184 --> 32:56.935
- Walk. Walk!
- OK.

32:57.019 --> 32:59.188
OK...

33:28.342 --> 33:29.218
What's this?

33:33.096 --> 33:34.306
Um...

33:35.557 --> 33:37.059
Plug it in. Plug it in.

33:41.438 --> 33:42.648
Step away.

34:08.090 --> 34:09.174
What?

34:09.675 --> 34:10.717
I'm hungry.

38:13.836 --> 38:15.796
Uh, business hasn't been
so great lately.

38:17.047 --> 38:18.006
Yeah?

38:18.799 --> 38:21.635
You think you have it bad here
in this big fancy mansion?

38:22.928 --> 38:24.179
It's not what it looks like.

38:24.263 --> 38:26.348
I inherited this place
from my father.

38:26.807 --> 38:28.141
You have no idea.

38:32.938 --> 38:34.064
Your dad religious?

38:35.941 --> 38:38.235
He started this place
as a church ministry

38:38.819 --> 38:42.322
as a way to...
give back to people that...

38:43.031 --> 38:45.117
had spent their lives
helping other people.

38:45.200 --> 38:46.577
Yeah, he was.

38:48.245 --> 38:49.371
So was I...

38:50.914 --> 38:52.291
then things happened.

39:52.851 --> 39:54.811
You ever invest
in cryptocurrency?

39:57.397 --> 39:58.440
You should.

39:59.691 --> 40:00.651
See...

40:00.734 --> 40:02.444
I'm in a family business, too.

40:02.945 --> 40:04.613
You do what you gotta do.

40:04.696 --> 40:05.739
So do I.

40:27.803 --> 40:28.846
Where is that?

40:29.596 --> 40:31.557
These are old.
We don't even use them...

40:31.640 --> 40:33.600
Enough with the games already!

40:33.684 --> 40:35.686
Take me there now. Walk!

41:27.279 --> 41:28.280
Move.

41:34.536 --> 41:35.454
Move!

41:38.290 --> 41:39.374
Amelia, run!

42:00.312 --> 42:02.898
Hey, no gun. No gun!

42:38.725 --> 42:40.227
<i>Chachita...</i>

42:41.353 --> 42:42.729
<i>Chachita?</i>

42:47.401 --> 42:48.694
<i>Chachita?</i>

43:20.976 --> 43:21.977
Psst.

43:55.302 --> 43:56.762
They're not going anywhere

43:57.262 --> 43:58.472
not with this storm.

44:00.015 --> 44:01.517
Let's just wait.

44:03.685 --> 44:04.853
What are you doing?

44:07.648 --> 44:09.525
- <i>Como?</i>
- What are you doing?

44:11.443 --> 44:13.820
This place got about 100 rooms.
You wanna go through 'em all?

44:13.904 --> 44:14.988
The girl.

44:15.280 --> 44:17.866
Guzman sent us to end this.

44:17.950 --> 44:18.992
Shh.

44:19.910 --> 44:22.996
Don't worry about my uncle.
We're doing it my way.

44:23.372 --> 44:24.540
Oh, yeah?

44:28.752 --> 44:29.711
Yeah.

44:36.301 --> 44:37.511
OK.

44:39.096 --> 44:40.430
They'll come to us.

46:53.021 --> 46:56.859
About time you guys
invited us girls to your club.

46:57.442 --> 46:59.111
We'll make an exception today.

46:59.194 --> 47:00.654
Is everyone OK?

47:03.115 --> 47:04.324
Mmm...

47:04.992 --> 47:06.410
Poor Linda.

47:07.411 --> 47:09.413
I just can't believe it.

47:10.539 --> 47:12.583
Poor, poor Linda.

47:13.375 --> 47:16.170
She ain't never done
nothing wrong to nobody.

47:16.795 --> 47:17.880
Nobody!

47:22.301 --> 47:24.928
W-we can't
just stay down here.

47:25.012 --> 47:26.638
We need to come up with a plan.

47:27.764 --> 47:28.891
Mm-hmm.

47:28.974 --> 47:30.058
Oh, yeah?

47:30.809 --> 47:32.603
Who made you
captain of the ship?

47:35.147 --> 47:36.190
I'm sorry

47:36.690 --> 47:38.233
but where are we gonna go, huh?

47:38.317 --> 47:40.986
We can't just
leave Taylor alone up there.

47:41.069 --> 47:42.529
T-that's what I'm saying.

47:44.072 --> 47:47.993
You gonna lead us into battle,
Mr Fake Colonel?

47:48.076 --> 47:50.037
Will you leave him alone?

47:50.621 --> 47:52.289
What is your problem?

47:53.040 --> 47:54.958
He acts like he's the boss

47:55.042 --> 47:57.044
when he's no different
than the rest of us.

47:58.420 --> 47:59.755
Isn't that right?

48:01.590 --> 48:03.800
Tell 'em... "Colonel"!

48:03.884 --> 48:05.761
What is wrong with you?

48:05.844 --> 48:08.555
This is hardly the time to...

48:08.639 --> 48:09.806
No, he's right.

48:10.641 --> 48:13.227
He's right. I'm not a colonel,
if you must know.

48:14.228 --> 48:15.562
I was in the Army...

48:16.563 --> 48:19.149
but when my battalion
shipped out, I couldn't go.

48:20.067 --> 48:22.819
Turned out
I had a spinal condition.

48:22.903 --> 48:24.655
Unfit to serve, they said.

48:25.447 --> 48:27.908
So, I spent the whole
Korean affair

48:27.991 --> 48:29.618
in an office behind a desk.

48:29.701 --> 48:30.994
Never fired a shot.

48:31.870 --> 48:34.122
Though, I did rise up
through the ranks.

48:35.123 --> 48:37.334
It was easy, when all the men...

48:38.252 --> 48:39.878
all the real men were gone.

48:40.754 --> 48:41.839
I was a major.

48:41.922 --> 48:44.174
I was set for promotion
to lieutenant colonel

48:44.842 --> 48:48.220
and then my battalion came back,
most of them.

48:49.096 --> 48:50.347
And they said

48:50.430 --> 48:53.517
"Fraser... you're gonna be
a lieutenant colonel?"

48:53.600 --> 48:56.353
We had a good laugh about it

48:56.436 --> 48:58.730
and they saluted and laughed.

49:00.482 --> 49:02.985
So, when it came time
for the promotion...

49:04.069 --> 49:05.529
I denied it.

49:05.612 --> 49:06.989
Just said, "never mind."

49:08.240 --> 49:09.491
So, you're right...

49:10.325 --> 49:11.869
I'm not a colonel

49:11.952 --> 49:13.620
not even a lieutenant colonel.

49:15.873 --> 49:19.501
I don't know any more or
have any special qualifications

49:19.585 --> 49:22.337
to get us out of this mess
than anyone else here.

49:23.589 --> 49:24.715
So...

49:25.799 --> 49:27.384
There it is.

49:29.761 --> 49:31.763
Oh, who cares?

49:32.347 --> 49:35.893
My husband spent the Korean War
making a fortune

49:35.976 --> 49:37.769
sneaking beer provisions

49:37.853 --> 49:39.688
and then selling them
on the side.

49:40.480 --> 49:43.734
Listen, ain't none of us heroes.

49:45.194 --> 49:48.947
What we gonna do now
is what I wanna know.

49:51.950 --> 49:53.035
Ida?

49:53.744 --> 49:55.537
- I...
- Hold my hand.

49:57.414 --> 49:59.166
That's it. Come on.

50:00.083 --> 50:01.084
Come on.

50:02.628 --> 50:03.879
Oh, Heavenly Father...

50:05.255 --> 50:07.049
we come to you now.

50:08.217 --> 50:09.676
We need you.

50:09.760 --> 50:11.178
Yes, Lord.

50:11.261 --> 50:13.138
Is this gonna be
one of her long ones?

50:14.014 --> 50:16.225
Please watch over the girl...

50:17.434 --> 50:19.061
the little girl, Father.

50:19.811 --> 50:21.688
- Keep her safe.
- Mm-hmm.

50:22.564 --> 50:25.025
Protect her from this evil.

50:28.111 --> 50:29.446
Keep her safe...

50:30.072 --> 50:31.990
under the shadow of your wing.

50:32.074 --> 50:33.408
Thank you, Lord.

50:34.618 --> 50:37.204
And we lift up Taylor
to you now, Lord.

50:38.038 --> 50:39.122
Yes.

50:40.499 --> 50:43.001
We pray
that she turns to you now.

51:10.362 --> 51:11.947
<i>Her burden is heavy</i>

51:12.865 --> 51:14.449
<i>but your burden is light.</i>

51:23.000 --> 51:25.544
<i>And keep us all safe
in this storm.</i>

51:27.379 --> 51:29.923
<i>We know that trials happen...</i>

51:31.383 --> 51:33.343
<i>but You are greater.</i>

51:41.560 --> 51:45.063
<i>Help us all
to trust in You entirely.</i>

51:46.815 --> 51:49.193
<i>In Your name, we pray.</i>

51:49.276 --> 51:51.069
<i>Honour His name.</i>

51:55.949 --> 51:57.284
Oh, sweetie, it's just me.

51:57.826 --> 51:59.244
It's OK. I'm not gonna hurt you.

52:01.288 --> 52:03.749
You can trust me.
It's OK. It's OK.

52:04.082 --> 52:06.251
It's OK. Shh.

52:06.335 --> 52:08.754
Shh. It's OK.

52:08.837 --> 52:09.755
It's OK.

52:11.882 --> 52:12.799
It's OK.

52:13.675 --> 52:15.385
It's OK. It's OK.

52:15.969 --> 52:18.013
These men,
they're looking for something.

52:18.889 --> 52:21.767
Some kind of code or something.
Do you know what it is?

52:21.975 --> 52:22.935
No.

52:24.228 --> 52:26.522
If we find it and give it
to them, they'll go away.

52:26.605 --> 52:27.731
Are you sure?

52:28.315 --> 52:29.399
I don't know.

52:29.483 --> 52:30.817
OK.

52:31.527 --> 52:32.986
We've gotta get outta here.

52:33.779 --> 52:35.280
If I can get you
out of this house

52:35.364 --> 52:37.658
do you think you can run
to one of the nearby neighbours

52:37.741 --> 52:39.076
and get us help somehow?

52:41.828 --> 52:43.705
OK, it's not safe.

52:43.789 --> 52:46.333
We better find somewhere safe
for you. Let's go. Come on.

52:55.592 --> 52:56.510
Alright...

52:57.511 --> 52:59.763
On my signal... we run.

53:00.848 --> 53:03.976
Three... two... one.

53:40.679 --> 53:43.056
He goes down, we go up.

53:46.059 --> 53:47.144
You live here?

53:49.354 --> 53:50.564
You're rich.

53:50.647 --> 53:52.983
It just looks like that.
Trust me.

54:03.076 --> 54:04.203
This way.

54:07.998 --> 54:08.957
Come on.

54:11.210 --> 54:12.336
Oh, wow.

54:45.494 --> 54:47.788
Right here.
Right through here.

54:47.871 --> 54:49.540
You must have a big family.

54:49.623 --> 54:51.708
It sure feels like it sometimes.

54:51.792 --> 54:52.793
Where are they?

54:52.876 --> 54:55.003
Oh, don't worry about them.
They're pretty resourceful.

54:55.087 --> 54:56.630
They'll be around here
somewhere.

54:56.713 --> 54:57.840
Come on. Right through here.

55:04.263 --> 55:05.556
Right this way, sweetie.

55:07.224 --> 55:08.392
OK.

55:10.352 --> 55:11.770
Alright, don't judge.

55:12.437 --> 55:15.065
It's OK. My room's messy, too.

55:21.697 --> 55:22.698
OK.

55:34.209 --> 55:35.294
Wow.

55:37.045 --> 55:38.881
I haven't been in here
in a long time.

55:40.007 --> 55:40.966
You did this?

55:42.634 --> 55:46.263
Not recently, but...
yeah, when I was about your age.

55:48.974 --> 55:50.767
Well, I almost forgot.

55:53.937 --> 55:54.980
What is that?

55:55.772 --> 55:56.982
Well, it's...

55:57.065 --> 55:59.818
a place where I keep important
things for safekeeping.

56:05.282 --> 56:06.241
Who is that?

56:06.909 --> 56:08.911
- That's me.
- That's you?

56:11.038 --> 56:13.874
That's my mum and dad
when they were still with us.

56:15.042 --> 56:17.336
This was taken on the day
they opened this place.

56:18.879 --> 56:21.048
They wanted to open
a place for poor people

56:21.632 --> 56:24.176
so that when they got older,
they had a place to live.

56:32.851 --> 56:34.394
Who are all those people?

56:35.020 --> 56:36.522
These were people
from the church.

56:37.105 --> 56:39.149
People that donated
their time and...

56:39.691 --> 56:41.944
and their money
so that we could open.

56:44.154 --> 56:45.405
I remember this day.

56:46.240 --> 56:48.075
They were all in the entrance
of the church

56:48.158 --> 56:50.410
and they were saying
this really long prayer and...

56:52.246 --> 56:54.456
all I could think about was,
"When are we gonna eat?"

56:59.378 --> 57:00.796
Look at those smiles.

57:01.672 --> 57:03.340
I haven't seen that in a while.

57:07.678 --> 57:09.513
Amelia, I have to go
and check on...

57:17.563 --> 57:18.605
What is this?

57:19.398 --> 57:22.317
That was my favourite shell
that my best friend gave me.

57:29.116 --> 57:31.368
Do you have
a brother or a sister?

57:33.328 --> 57:34.246
Do you?

57:37.583 --> 57:38.750
Not anymore.

57:40.419 --> 57:43.380
I had a sister... a big sister.

57:44.965 --> 57:46.425
I'm sorry.

57:48.051 --> 57:49.094
It's OK.

57:49.970 --> 57:51.388
I hardly remember.

57:53.390 --> 57:54.558
I was little.

57:55.934 --> 57:57.352
It was the cartel.

58:04.735 --> 58:05.986
Do you have kids?

58:07.237 --> 58:08.238
No.

58:09.448 --> 58:10.532
Oh.

58:10.616 --> 58:12.242
I wanted to, but I couldn't.

58:13.285 --> 58:14.203
Sorry.

58:15.746 --> 58:17.372
It wasn't meant to be, I guess.

58:18.373 --> 58:21.919
Sometimes we just have to trust
God has a different plan.

58:30.010 --> 58:31.136
I need to go downstairs.

58:31.220 --> 58:33.847
I need to check on my friends
and make sure they're OK.

58:33.931 --> 58:35.098
OK.

58:35.182 --> 58:38.310
I want you to stay here, though.
You'll be safe here.

58:38.936 --> 58:39.937
OK.

58:40.395 --> 58:41.480
I will.

58:45.442 --> 58:46.568
What does that mean?

58:49.196 --> 58:50.280
Get rid of them.

01:01:09.211 --> 01:01:10.212
Taylor?

01:01:11.713 --> 01:01:12.714
Hello?

01:01:41.743 --> 01:01:42.953
Hey! Come here!

01:01:43.036 --> 01:01:44.955
Come here! Come here! Come here!

01:01:45.038 --> 01:01:46.123
Come on. Come on!

01:02:06.935 --> 01:02:08.228
Enough!

01:02:26.872 --> 01:02:28.207
We do it my way.

01:02:29.499 --> 01:02:30.542
We wait.

01:02:56.068 --> 01:02:57.069
So...

01:02:58.612 --> 01:03:00.781
No one knows anything, huh?

01:03:04.952 --> 01:03:07.079
You have something
that belongs to me.

01:03:08.330 --> 01:03:09.998
You give it to me and we...

01:03:11.291 --> 01:03:12.251
we go.

01:03:12.334 --> 01:03:15.045
Look, I told you, we don't know
what you're looking for.

01:03:15.128 --> 01:03:17.464
OK? We don't have
anything to do with this.

01:03:20.676 --> 01:03:22.678
No!

01:03:22.761 --> 01:03:25.180
Sit down! You will tell me.

01:03:25.264 --> 01:03:26.223
Tell me where it is!

01:03:26.306 --> 01:03:27.766
I don't know.
I don't know what it is.

01:03:27.850 --> 01:03:29.768
The code from your papa.
Where is it? Where is it?

01:03:30.018 --> 01:03:31.144
That's enough.

01:03:31.228 --> 01:03:32.729
You have to know! You tell me!

01:03:32.813 --> 01:03:34.273
<i>No se! No se, por favor!</i>

01:03:34.356 --> 01:03:35.482
That's enough!

01:03:38.026 --> 01:03:39.152
None of us.

01:03:40.195 --> 01:03:41.321
Listen to me.

01:03:41.405 --> 01:03:43.073
I wanna talk to you.

01:03:43.198 --> 01:03:44.992
<i>Tu y tu muchachos.</i>

01:03:45.617 --> 01:03:46.660
<i>Mira, mira!</i>

01:03:47.536 --> 01:03:49.037
You have done enough here.

01:03:49.121 --> 01:03:51.331
You have done enough!

01:03:52.040 --> 01:03:54.710
You and your men
will leave this place

01:03:54.793 --> 01:03:56.753
and never come back again.

01:03:57.421 --> 01:03:59.214
This is a good place...

01:04:00.424 --> 01:04:01.717
a safe place.

01:04:02.509 --> 01:04:05.137
You don't know this,
so I am going to tell you.

01:04:06.388 --> 01:04:09.057
When her father opened this home

01:04:09.391 --> 01:04:12.352
he dedicated it with a verse

01:04:12.436 --> 01:04:16.273
a Bible verse, Isaiah 25:4.

01:04:17.691 --> 01:04:20.861
"A refuge for the needy
in their distress...

01:04:21.653 --> 01:04:23.864
a shelter from the storm..."

01:04:23.947 --> 01:04:26.450
A shelter from the storm!

01:04:26.533 --> 01:04:27.826
That is perfect!

01:04:28.202 --> 01:04:29.703
Especially for today.

01:04:30.412 --> 01:04:34.208
Do you know
what else Isaiah 25 said?

01:04:34.791 --> 01:04:38.837
"In that day they will rise up
and they will say

01:04:38.921 --> 01:04:41.507
'Surely He is our God.

01:04:42.466 --> 01:04:45.719
We trusted in Him...
and He saved us.'"

01:04:45.802 --> 01:04:47.304
He saved us!

01:04:49.598 --> 01:04:50.682
So, you...

01:04:51.642 --> 01:04:52.976
can threaten us...

01:04:54.019 --> 01:04:55.103
you can hurt us

01:04:55.687 --> 01:04:57.689
but you cannot destroy us...

01:04:58.565 --> 01:04:59.983
because we are safe.

01:05:02.694 --> 01:05:04.196
Not in this house...

01:05:05.364 --> 01:05:06.949
we are safe in Him.

01:05:09.243 --> 01:05:11.662
He is our fortress.

01:05:13.038 --> 01:05:15.374
And now, get out!

01:05:17.125 --> 01:05:19.044
You're not safe!

01:05:21.588 --> 01:05:22.673
How dare you?

01:05:23.799 --> 01:05:25.592
How dare you?

01:05:26.552 --> 01:05:27.886
Who do you think you are?

01:05:28.595 --> 01:05:30.556
She's a 93-year-old woman.

01:05:31.431 --> 01:05:32.933
Ninety-three years old

01:05:33.016 --> 01:05:36.061
and she has more courage
in her little finger

01:05:36.144 --> 01:05:37.729
than you will ever have.

01:05:37.813 --> 01:05:39.022
You are a coward!

01:05:39.982 --> 01:05:41.358
A coward.

01:05:41.441 --> 01:05:42.317
Shut up.

01:05:50.075 --> 01:05:51.577
Go! Go!

01:05:52.536 --> 01:05:53.579
Move!

01:06:04.464 --> 01:06:06.300
Help me with this.

01:06:06.383 --> 01:06:08.051
Push!

01:06:11.555 --> 01:06:13.724
Push! Push!

01:06:13.807 --> 01:06:15.517
Stay down!

01:06:16.727 --> 01:06:17.978
No...

01:06:56.517 --> 01:06:58.894
What are you doing?
You're gonna get us killed!

01:07:37.182 --> 01:07:38.892
It's all clear in there.

01:07:38.976 --> 01:07:40.018
Everybody OK?

01:07:41.603 --> 01:07:42.604
Is she alright?

01:07:43.105 --> 01:07:45.524
No, she needs help.
I'll be right back.

01:07:45.607 --> 01:07:47.651
- Any other bad guys?
- You alright?

01:07:47.734 --> 01:07:48.986
No, just the three.

01:07:51.113 --> 01:07:52.239
Where's your dad?

01:07:55.242 --> 01:07:56.326
<i>Donde tu papa?</i>

01:08:01.999 --> 01:08:03.125
I'm sorry.

01:08:05.544 --> 01:08:06.962
Are you gonna be OK?

01:08:08.046 --> 01:08:09.131
You sure?

01:08:10.465 --> 01:08:12.467
I have to ask you something.

01:08:14.219 --> 01:08:16.305
Where's the code...

01:08:17.014 --> 01:08:18.557
that your dad had with him?

01:08:20.975 --> 01:08:22.185
You don't know?

01:08:24.229 --> 01:08:26.356
I know it's difficult
right now, OK?

01:08:27.191 --> 01:08:29.318
But I need you
to think real hard for me.

01:08:32.154 --> 01:08:33.363
I don't know.

01:08:36.116 --> 01:08:38.160
You sure you don't know
where it is?

01:08:39.077 --> 01:08:40.370
It's very important.

01:08:46.084 --> 01:08:47.085
OK.

01:08:48.212 --> 01:08:49.337
No problem.

01:08:50.631 --> 01:08:51.756
Listen up, everyone.

01:08:52.633 --> 01:08:54.801
If I can just get your attention
for a minute.

01:08:55.301 --> 01:08:56.886
I'm Cole Bennett with the DEA.

01:08:58.680 --> 01:09:00.265
There's an important
piece of evidence

01:09:00.349 --> 01:09:02.350
this young lady
and her father were transporting

01:09:02.434 --> 01:09:04.019
as part of an investigation.

01:09:04.435 --> 01:09:05.854
Without it...

01:09:05.938 --> 01:09:08.689
some very bad men will go free.

01:09:09.399 --> 01:09:11.026
What is it?
What does it look like?

01:09:11.777 --> 01:09:13.444
Not exactly sure.

01:09:13.529 --> 01:09:18.116
It's a code on a computer drive,
a chip of some kind.

01:09:19.243 --> 01:09:21.286
Have any of you seen
anything like that?

01:09:22.746 --> 01:09:24.331
- No.
- No.

01:09:24.412 --> 01:09:25.791
Are you sure?

01:09:25.874 --> 01:09:26.959
We're sure.

01:09:30.379 --> 01:09:31.462
Can I ask you again?

01:09:32.881 --> 01:09:34.424
I want you to think, honey.

01:09:35.259 --> 01:09:37.636
Think back when you first
got here with your dad.

01:09:40.430 --> 01:09:41.765
I don't know.

01:09:41.849 --> 01:09:43.350
I cannot remember.

01:09:44.059 --> 01:09:44.977
Come on.

01:09:47.229 --> 01:09:48.229
Think!

01:09:49.523 --> 01:09:50.439
What's going on?

01:09:55.529 --> 01:09:57.197
Let me guess...

01:09:57.281 --> 01:09:58.490
You're looking for a code.

01:09:59.950 --> 01:10:01.201
Do you know where it is?

01:10:01.785 --> 01:10:04.162
I don't know anything
about your business.

01:10:04.246 --> 01:10:05.330
None of us do.

01:10:06.999 --> 01:10:09.042
One of you... does.

01:10:09.126 --> 01:10:10.419
What are you doing?

01:10:11.044 --> 01:10:12.129
Listen to me.

01:10:14.047 --> 01:10:15.507
Tell me where the code is.

01:10:16.842 --> 01:10:17.885
Where is it?

01:10:21.972 --> 01:10:25.017
Your father had a bag...
a black bag.

01:10:26.727 --> 01:10:28.645
Where is it? Speak up!

01:10:30.105 --> 01:10:31.231
Where is it?

01:10:34.985 --> 01:10:36.028
Ah...

01:10:36.778 --> 01:10:39.323
All of a sudden,
you know things.

01:10:39.531 --> 01:10:40.574
Let her go.

01:10:45.829 --> 01:10:47.289
All of you stay here.

01:10:47.748 --> 01:10:48.874
Do you understand?

01:10:49.541 --> 01:10:50.792
Stay here!

01:10:53.337 --> 01:10:54.338
Understood.

01:11:00.302 --> 01:11:02.429
Oh, my God.

01:11:03.305 --> 01:11:05.599
Are you OK?

01:11:09.311 --> 01:11:10.270
Miss Taylor?

01:11:14.399 --> 01:11:15.484
Come on.

01:11:16.902 --> 01:11:18.237
Alright, stay with me.

01:11:18.320 --> 01:11:20.489
The girl... she's OK?

01:11:20.572 --> 01:11:22.074
That's OK. It's OK.
Hang in there.

01:11:22.157 --> 01:11:23.867
Hang in there. I got you.

01:11:23.951 --> 01:11:25.077
- I got...
- Listen.

01:11:27.329 --> 01:11:28.497
Trust...

01:11:30.791 --> 01:11:32.042
Him.

01:11:48.016 --> 01:11:49.434
No...

01:11:50.894 --> 01:11:54.815
No, no!

01:11:58.193 --> 01:11:59.278
No...

01:12:01.405 --> 01:12:02.489
I...

01:12:06.201 --> 01:12:08.120
I can't! Oh...

01:12:08.203 --> 01:12:09.621
I can't, I can't. Oh!

01:12:09.705 --> 01:12:12.833
I can't do this anymore.
I can't do this any...

01:12:13.417 --> 01:12:14.751
Miss Taylor.

01:12:19.214 --> 01:12:22.009
- Hey.
- I can't... I...

01:12:22.092 --> 01:12:23.218
Come on now.

01:12:24.178 --> 01:12:25.179
Snap out of it.

01:12:30.642 --> 01:12:32.060
It's gonna be OK.

01:12:33.562 --> 01:12:34.771
Ida would say that.

01:12:35.522 --> 01:12:36.690
That's right.

01:12:38.817 --> 01:12:39.943
One step at a time.

01:12:41.528 --> 01:12:42.821
That's what she'd say.

01:12:44.239 --> 01:12:46.033
Trust the next step.

01:13:09.264 --> 01:13:10.307
Hey...

01:13:12.309 --> 01:13:13.727
You hear that?

01:13:14.102 --> 01:13:15.145
Hmm?

01:13:17.022 --> 01:13:18.148
Exactly.

01:13:19.107 --> 01:13:20.192
Me neither.

01:13:21.527 --> 01:13:23.570
Must be the eye of the storm.

01:13:41.004 --> 01:13:44.633
You know...
I think I like that look.

01:13:50.806 --> 01:13:52.015
Where you going?

01:13:54.268 --> 01:13:55.894
I'm gonna take
that next step.

01:14:01.441 --> 01:14:02.526
This way?

01:14:03.527 --> 01:14:05.195
Come on, let's keep looking.

01:14:12.077 --> 01:14:13.912
No!

01:14:14.538 --> 01:14:16.748
Come on, Amelia! Go! Go!

01:14:33.515 --> 01:14:36.310
Alright, let me think.
Hide. Hide here. Hide here.

01:14:40.230 --> 01:14:41.315
OK...

01:14:45.611 --> 01:14:47.362
What do you think
you're doing, huh?

01:14:51.033 --> 01:14:52.534
You know where it is.

01:14:57.581 --> 01:14:59.625
You want to keep
that money for yourself.

01:15:01.043 --> 01:15:02.085
It's mine.

01:15:03.295 --> 01:15:05.714
You know how many years
I put into this?

01:15:07.090 --> 01:15:09.009
Filthy barrio slums.

01:15:13.722 --> 01:15:15.182
Filthy slum rats...

01:15:16.016 --> 01:15:17.434
bringing drugs in here.

01:15:18.519 --> 01:15:20.020
Whose side are you on?

01:15:32.950 --> 01:15:34.493
They're killing my men.

01:15:35.577 --> 01:15:36.703
Our men.

01:15:38.622 --> 01:15:39.790
That traitor...

01:15:40.707 --> 01:15:42.793
and his daughter
are in the middle of it.

01:15:45.003 --> 01:15:46.463
So was her mother.

01:15:48.715 --> 01:15:51.802
And I will get rid
of that little runt, too...

01:15:52.928 --> 01:15:55.430
if she doesn't tell me
what I wanna know.

01:16:09.820 --> 01:16:10.988
Come here.

01:16:28.172 --> 01:16:29.882
I'm so sorry.

01:16:34.219 --> 01:16:36.722
- I'm so sorry...
- It's T! It's T!

01:16:44.771 --> 01:16:45.856
It's OK.

01:16:48.150 --> 01:16:49.484
It's OK.

01:17:34.196 --> 01:17:35.280
OK.

01:17:36.323 --> 01:17:37.407
Thank you.

01:17:38.116 --> 01:17:39.326
Excuse me.

01:17:39.409 --> 01:17:40.827
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

01:17:42.454 --> 01:17:44.498
Amelia, do you know
what these papers are?

01:17:45.832 --> 01:17:46.917
A little bit.

01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:49.461
Miss Ward is applying
for foster care.

01:17:50.045 --> 01:17:51.296
Do you know what that is?

01:17:52.214 --> 01:17:53.340
I think so.

01:17:54.174 --> 01:17:56.343
It means that, if you want to...

01:17:56.885 --> 01:17:58.720
you may be able
to stay here for a while.

01:17:59.888 --> 01:18:01.348
I can stay with her?

01:18:02.474 --> 01:18:04.810
Well, there are a few things
to go over, but...

01:18:05.519 --> 01:18:06.937
we might be able
to make that happen.

01:18:10.274 --> 01:18:11.775
Oh, just a sec.

01:18:16.655 --> 01:18:18.615
I think I know
where she might be going.

01:18:18.699 --> 01:18:20.200
We'll be right back.

01:18:20.284 --> 01:18:21.368
OK.

01:18:36.008 --> 01:18:37.176
What's that?

01:18:37.801 --> 01:18:39.553
My father gave it to me.

01:18:39.636 --> 01:18:41.388
He said it belonged
to my mother.

01:18:42.014 --> 01:18:43.223
It's very pretty.

01:18:44.933 --> 01:18:46.768
He told me
not to let anyone have it

01:18:46.852 --> 01:18:48.645
so I hid it here, like you did.

01:18:51.064 --> 01:18:52.316
Can I see it for a second?

01:19:10.542 --> 01:19:11.752
Your father was right.

01:19:11.835 --> 01:19:14.087
This is a very,
very special necklace.

01:19:15.881 --> 01:19:17.633
Someone I was very close to
once told me

01:19:17.716 --> 01:19:19.718
that all you have to do
is trust.

01:19:20.010 --> 01:19:21.220
An <i>abuelita?</i>

01:19:22.679 --> 01:19:23.722
Yeah.

01:19:25.390 --> 01:19:27.309
That even when you think
something's impossible

01:19:27.392 --> 01:19:29.228
there is always, always a way.

01:19:30.938 --> 01:19:32.856
My father was right
about this place.

01:19:35.192 --> 01:19:36.401
It's very special.

01:19:37.402 --> 01:19:38.403
Like my necklace?

01:19:39.488 --> 01:19:40.572
Yeah...

01:19:41.323 --> 01:19:42.574
like your necklace.

01:19:44.826 --> 01:19:46.537
This is a very valuable gift.

01:19:49.289 --> 01:19:50.832
Make sure you cherish it always.

01:19:58.590 --> 01:20:00.384
Ooh, what is this?

01:20:02.052 --> 01:20:04.429
Oh, wow, I haven't seen that
in a long time.

01:20:05.514 --> 01:20:06.598
Do you like to draw?

01:20:06.682 --> 01:20:08.016
- Yeah.
- Me too.

01:20:08.100 --> 01:20:10.227
At home I had
a bunch of pictures in my room.

01:20:10.310 --> 01:20:11.395
You did?
