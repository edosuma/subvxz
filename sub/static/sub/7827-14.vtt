I might not be around

1918 Liberty Head

02:14.217 --> 02:18.555
You see, back in those days,
rich men would ride around

02:18.638 --> 02:22.976
in zeppelins,
dropping coins on people.

02:23.059 --> 02:27.981
And one day, I seen
J.D. Rockefeller flyin' by,

02:28.064 --> 02:31.943
so I run out of the house
with a big washtub, and--

02:32.026 --> 02:34.445
-(grunts) Where are you goin'?
-Dad, we'd love to stay here

02:34.529 --> 02:36.364

02:39.492 --> 02:42.120
GRAMPA:
Anyway, about my washtub.

02:42.203 --> 02:45.748
I just used it that morning
to wash my turkey,

02:45.832 --> 02:48.042
which in those days
was known as

02:48.126 --> 02:50.587
a "walking bird."

02:50.670 --> 02:53.131
We'd always have walking bird
on Thanksgiving,

02:53.214 --> 02:55.383

02:55.466 --> 02:58.094

02:58.178 --> 03:01.014
and yams stuffed
with gunpowder.

03:01.097 --> 03:03.349
Then we'd all watch football,

03:03.433 --> 03:06.477
which in those days
was called "baseball."

03:06.561 --> 03:09.439

03:21.117 --> 03:24.162

useful, like storm windows?

a stirring and memorable address.

-Right on! Say it, sister.
-It's not funny, Bart.

07:26.821 --> 07:29.991
Millions of girls will grow up thinking
that this is the right way to act.

07:30.074 --> 07:32.326
That they can never be anything
more than vacuous ninnies

07:32.410 --> 07:34.495
whose only goal is to look
pretty, land a rich husband,

07:34.579 --> 07:35.997

Lisa, ordinarily I'd say

08:35.973 --> 08:37.808
you should stand up
for what you believe in.

08:37.892 --> 08:40.144
But you've been doing that
an awful lot lately.

08:40.228 --> 08:43.856
Yeah. You made us march
in that gay rights parade.

08:43.940 --> 08:45.858
And we can't watch Fox,
'cause they own

08:45.942 --> 08:48.152
those chemical
weapon plants in Syria.

08:48.236 --> 08:50.154
I can't believe you're just
gonna stand by

I'd be happy to answer--

11:07.792 --> 11:09.502
-I have one.
-Yes?

11:09.585 --> 11:12.713
Is the remarkably sexist drivel
spouted by Malibu Stacy

11:12.797 --> 11:15.508
intentional, or is it
just a horrible mistake?

11:15.591 --> 11:19.679
(chuckles) Believe me, we're very
mindful of such concerns.

11:19.762 --> 11:21.681
(wolf whistle)

11:21.764 --> 11:24.892
Hey, Jiggles! Grab a pad
and back that gorgeous butt in here.

11:24.975 --> 11:26.435
Oh, you. Get away!
(chuckles)

11:26.519 --> 11:27.770
Ah, don't act like
you don't like it.

11:30.398 --> 11:31.899
(Lisa moans)

11:33.776 --> 11:36.612
It's awful bein' a kid.
No one listens to ya.

11:36.696 --> 11:39.865
It's rotten bein' old.
No one listens to ya!

11:39.949 --> 11:42.410
I'm a white male,
aged 18 to 49.

11:42.493 --> 11:43.911
Everyone listens to me,

11:43.994 --> 11:46.372
no matter how dumb
my suggestions are.

11:48.416 --> 11:50.000
(chewing noisily)

11:50.084 --> 11:52.461
But I'm not gonna accomplish
anything just sitting here--

11:52.545 --> 11:54.714
-And gripin', it's time for--
-Action!

11:54.797 --> 11:57.633
I've got to talk to that woman
who invented Malibu Stacy

11:57.717 --> 11:59.885
-and see if I can get her to--
-Come out of retirement!

11:59.969 --> 12:03.848
I'm gonna get me a job!
A real Malibu...

12:03.931 --> 12:07.059
And see if Stacy can help

12:07.143 --> 12:10.187
invent me young.

12:10.271 --> 12:12.565
Help!

12:12.648 --> 12:16.944
-You're getting a job!
-Yes! I'm going where the action is!

12:17.027 --> 12:18.863
-(radio static)
-Come in? Come in!

12:18.946 --> 12:21.407
Mayday! I'm losing
your transmission!

12:21.490 --> 12:23.826
-I said, "French fries!"
-(horns honking)

12:23.909 --> 12:25.703
-What the--
-(horns honking)

12:25.786 --> 12:30.040
Do we sell French fries?

12:33.210 --> 12:34.670
Yes? I-- (chuckles)

12:34.754 --> 12:37.047
Why, it's Homer Simpson's
daughter.

12:37.131 --> 12:38.799
I thought you might be able to help me

12:38.883 --> 12:40.968
get in touch with the inventor
of Malibu Stacy.

12:41.051 --> 12:43.721
Whew! (chuckles)
That would be quite a feat.

12:43.804 --> 12:45.681
Stacy Lavelle is
a total recluse.

12:45.765 --> 12:48.017
She hasn't appeared
in public in 20 years.

12:48.100 --> 12:51.645
Here, I'm writing an article on her
for my next Malibu Stacy newsletter.

12:51.729 --> 12:54.690
It contains her last
known whereabouts.

12:54.774 --> 12:56.525
-I'll, uh, print you out a copy.
-Thanks.

12:56.609 --> 12:58.903
<i>Hello, Smithers.</i>

12:58.986 --> 13:02.531
<i>You're quite good...</i>
<i>at turning... me on.</i>

13:02.615 --> 13:05.242
Um, you probably
should ignore that.

13:05.326 --> 13:06.869
(panting)

13:13.125 --> 13:14.293
(tires skidding)

13:14.376 --> 13:16.670
No, it couldn't be!

13:25.679 --> 13:28.349
-(buzzing)
-Excuse me. Miss Lavelle?

13:28.432 --> 13:30.726
I'd like to talk to you
about Malibu Stacy?

13:30.810 --> 13:35.731
<i>Do you have any idea how many kids</i>
<i>have tried to track me down?</i>

13:35.815 --> 13:38.692
-Am I the first?
<i>-Yes.</i>

13:38.776 --> 13:43.572
I want you to hear what Malibu Stacy
is telling a generation of little girls.

13:43.656 --> 13:45.741
<i>Thinking too much</i>
<i>gives you wrinkles.</i>

13:47.159 --> 13:48.577
(gate rattles)

13:51.705 --> 13:55.835
All right! I've been waitin'
nine years to get my frisbee back.

13:55.918 --> 13:57.169
Oh!

14:01.340 --> 14:03.759
<i>My name is Stacy.</i>
<i>But you can call me--</i>

14:03.843 --> 14:05.636
<i>(wolf whistle)</i>

14:05.719 --> 14:08.639
I see exactly what you mean.
This is a problem.

14:08.722 --> 14:10.516
But what do you
expect me to do?

14:10.599 --> 14:12.810
Change what she says.
It's your company.

14:12.893 --> 14:15.938
(scoffs) Not since
I was forced out in 1974.

14:16.021 --> 14:19.358
They said my way of thinking
just wasn't cost-effective.

14:19.441 --> 14:21.610
-That's awful!
-Well, that, and...

14:21.694 --> 14:24.822
I was funneling profits
to the Vietcong.

14:24.905 --> 14:26.699
But you are Malibu Stacy.

14:26.782 --> 14:29.785
And as long as she has your name,
you have a responsibility!

14:29.869 --> 14:31.954
I'd be mortified if someone
ever made a lousy product

14:32.037 --> 14:33.873
with the Simpson name on it.

14:33.956 --> 14:37.459
I may have had things in common
with Stacy in the beginning,

14:37.543 --> 14:41.881
but 30 years of living her lifestyle
taught me some very harsh lessons.

14:41.964 --> 14:45.634
Five husbands:
Ken, Johnny, Joe,

14:45.718 --> 14:48.095
Dr. Colossus, Steve Austin.

14:48.178 --> 14:51.849
But if you can learn from Malibu Stacy's
mistakes, so can everyone.

14:51.932 --> 14:53.642
I'm sure we can
think of something together.

14:53.726 --> 14:57.521
-Come on!
-Not now. I'm too drunk.

14:57.605 --> 14:59.189
No, you're not!

15:00.566 --> 15:03.068
(slurping, swallowing)

15:03.152 --> 15:06.614
Uh, I'll come back tomorrow.

15:06.697 --> 15:11.827
We need some more secret sauce!
Put this mayonnaise in the sun.

15:11.911 --> 15:16.415
Hey! Now that old man Peterson's
off our backs, let's have some fun!

15:16.498 --> 15:21.670
(muffled) Ever see a sandwich
that could take a bite outta you?

15:21.754 --> 15:24.548
(laughing)
Look at the sandwich!

15:24.632 --> 15:26.383
It's gonna bite you!

15:29.345 --> 15:30.846
-(biting sound)
-MAN: Ow!

15:30.930 --> 15:32.473
Damn sandwich
took a bite out of me!

15:32.556 --> 15:33.557
Oh.

15:35.476 --> 15:37.144
I've got the solution.

15:37.227 --> 15:40.230
You and I are gonna make
our own talking doll.

15:40.314 --> 15:41.982
She'll have the wisdom
of Gertrude Stein

15:42.066 --> 15:43.776
and the wit
of Cathy Guisewite.

15:43.859 --> 15:45.611
The tenacity of Nina Totenberg

15:45.694 --> 15:48.489
and the common sense
of Elizabeth Cady Stanton.

15:48.572 --> 15:53.494
And to top it off, the down-to-earth good
looks of Eleanor Roosevelt.

15:53.577 --> 15:54.828
(exhales)

15:54.912 --> 15:56.080
All right.

15:56.163 --> 15:58.040
We'll make your doll!

15:58.123 --> 16:01.669
-(pounding on door)
-(gasps)

16:01.752 --> 16:04.046
Stacy, please.
I must have you back.

16:04.129 --> 16:06.966
Just come for a ride with me
in my mobile command unit.

16:07.049 --> 16:09.760
Joe, I told you.
It's over.

16:09.843 --> 16:11.345
Release me from
your kung fu grip.

16:11.428 --> 16:12.930
Fine.

16:13.013 --> 16:15.891
I'll bomb your house
into the ground, missy!

16:20.854 --> 16:23.649
Make sure you get
my mom's hair just right!

16:23.732 --> 16:26.193
Um, I think we'll use someone
different for the hair.

16:26.276 --> 16:27.486
How about me?

16:27.569 --> 16:28.946
There's something
not quite--

16:29.029 --> 16:30.781
-How 'bout me?
-(stammering)

16:30.864 --> 16:32.783
-How 'bout me?
-You all have hideous hair!

16:32.866 --> 16:33.951
(Simpsons gasping)

16:34.034 --> 16:36.078
I mean, from a design
point of view.

16:36.161 --> 16:38.789
-Oh, well, if you put it that way.
-Oh, well.

16:38.872 --> 16:41.166
Talking doll, take eight.

16:41.250 --> 16:44.753
"When I get married,
I'm keeping my own name."

16:44.837 --> 16:46.797
Uh, you know,
that should probably be,

16:46.880 --> 16:49.091
"if I choose to get married."

16:49.174 --> 16:53.220
Look, little girl, we got other
talking dollies to record today.

16:53.303 --> 16:55.931
All right, you poindexters.
Let's get this right.

16:56.015 --> 16:58.058
One: "Hey, hey, kids,
I'm talkin' Krusty."

16:58.142 --> 17:00.144
Two: "Hey, hey! Here
comes Sideshow Mel."

17:00.227 --> 17:02.396
Again. "Here comes Sideshow Mel.
Sideshow Mel."

17:02.479 --> 17:04.398
Three.
(laughing)

17:04.481 --> 17:08.360
Bada-bing, bada-boom. I'm done.
Learn from a professional, kid.

17:08.444 --> 17:11.321
(car door closing,
tires screeching)

17:11.405 --> 17:15.117
Okay, Krusty. We are ready
to roll any-- What the--

17:20.080 --> 17:23.459
LISA'S VOICE: <i>Trust in yourself</i>
<i>and you can achieve anything.</i>

17:23.542 --> 17:25.461
All right!
Now all we need is a name.

17:25.544 --> 17:27.546
How 'bout "Blabbermouth,
the Jerky Doll for Jerks"?

17:27.629 --> 17:31.091
How 'bout Minerva, after
the Roman goddess of wisdom?

17:31.175 --> 17:33.218
Mm, not enough
commercial appeal.

17:33.302 --> 17:36.138
"Wendy Windbag"?
"Ugly Doris"?

17:36.221 --> 17:38.140
"Hortense, the mule-faced doll"?

17:38.223 --> 17:40.350
I think we should
name her after Lisa.

17:40.434 --> 17:43.270
We'll call her
"Lisa Lionheart."

17:43.353 --> 17:47.024
No, "Loudmouth Lisa!"
"Stupid Lisa Garbage Face!"

17:47.107 --> 17:50.486
I can't stand this any longer.
Somebody please pay attention to me!

17:50.569 --> 17:52.821
Hello! Pay attention to me.
Look at me!

17:52.905 --> 17:56.033
I'm Bart, I'm Bart. Look at me.
Look at me. Look at me. (blathering)

17:57.910 --> 18:01.413
This is great! They're
really gonna sell our doll!

18:01.497 --> 18:04.583
Well, it wasn't difficult. I just told
them who I was and who you were.

18:04.666 --> 18:06.668
-They couldn't resist.
-Really?

18:06.752 --> 18:07.961
Well, I didn't tell them
who you were.

18:11.381 --> 18:14.760
Gentlemen, we've got to sink this
Lisa Lionheart doll and fast.

18:14.843 --> 18:17.012
It's time to call in a favor
from Washington.

18:18.889 --> 18:22.476
Yes. Yes, I understand.
I'll take care of it personally.

18:27.189 --> 18:29.650
(chuckling)

18:29.733 --> 18:32.319
-LISA: Dad, did you hear something?
-HOMER: I don't know.

18:32.402 --> 18:34.530
-Dad?
-Mm-hmm?

18:34.613 --> 18:35.948
My new doll's much better
than Malibu Stacy.

18:36.031 --> 18:37.366
Do a newscast about her.

18:37.449 --> 18:39.243
(laughing)
Oh, please, honey.

18:39.326 --> 18:41.703
Daddy's job is to bring
people important news.

18:41.787 --> 18:43.413
Right now,
I'm very busy preparing

18:43.497 --> 18:45.707
a report about the 40th
anniversary of Beetle Bailey.

18:45.791 --> 18:48.085
Oh, Daddy, that is boring.

18:48.168 --> 18:50.546
Talk about the dolly!

18:50.629 --> 18:53.423
Well, you were right
about the Berlin Wall.

18:57.136 --> 19:01.223
<i>Though it was unusual to spend</i>
<i>28 minutes reporting on a doll,</i>

19:01.306 --> 19:04.184
<i>this reporter found it</i>
<i>impossible to stop talking.</i>

<i>It's just really</i>

<i>Or you can turn</i>
<i>to another channel.</i>

19:16.572 --> 19:19.241
<i>Oh. Do not turn</i>
<i>to another channel.</i>

19:19.324 --> 19:22.703
Our one effort to put a stop to this
Lisa Lionheart thing has failed miserably.

19:22.786 --> 19:26.039
Gentlemen, we have to reinvent
Malibu Stacy for the '90s.

19:26.123 --> 19:28.375
We'll stay here all night,
if need be.

19:28.458 --> 19:30.961
Can we order Chinese food?

19:31.044 --> 19:32.171
Yes.

19:32.254 --> 19:35.632
-(chattering)
-You know a good place?

19:37.968 --> 19:40.095
I cut my tongue
on these pancakes.

19:40.179 --> 19:42.598
These eggs are difficult
to digest.

19:42.681 --> 19:44.892
I want soft-boiled eggs.

19:44.975 --> 19:48.854
I told you-- We don't
have soft-boiled eggs!

19:48.937 --> 19:50.397
If you a--

19:50.480 --> 19:53.192
By gum, you're right.
We should have them.

19:53.275 --> 19:55.485
I shouldn't be listenin'
to complaints.

19:55.569 --> 19:57.738
I should be makin' 'em
with you guys.

19:57.821 --> 20:01.074
The good Lord lets us
grow old for a reason.

20:01.158 --> 20:05.329

fault with everything He's made!

20:05.412 --> 20:10.042
Mr. Peterson, you can take
this job and... fill it.

20:10.125 --> 20:14.296
And one more thing.
I never once washed my hands.

20:14.379 --> 20:17.466

not mine.

We're almost there.

(girls gasping)

20:52.834 --> 20:54.795
They changed Malibu Stacy!

20:54.878 --> 20:56.505
She is better than ever.

20:56.588 --> 20:58.465
Wait! Don't be fooled.

20:58.548 --> 21:01.802
She's just a regular Malibu Stacy
with a stupid, cheap hat.

21:01.885 --> 21:04.805
She still embodies all the awful
stereotypes she did before.

21:04.888 --> 21:07.557
But she's got a new hat.

21:07.641 --> 21:09.601

it'll all be worth it.

21:33.333 --> 21:36.044
Yes. Particularly if that
little girl happens to pay

$46,000 for that doll.
