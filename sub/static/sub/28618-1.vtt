00:02.603 --> 00:05.371
[upbeat music]

00:23.424 --> 00:25.524
[sounds of the city]

01:29.623 --> 01:30.689
[laughs]

01:34.261 --> 01:35.227
[shouting]

01:35.229 --> 01:39.565
Hey, baby.
What are you doing? You're
not supposed to play with that.

01:39.567 --> 01:41.767
Give it to me, yeah.

01:41.769 --> 01:42.801
Look at this.

01:42.803 --> 01:45.170
-Me.
-[Kyle] Yeah.

01:45.172 --> 01:46.772
You're beautiful.

01:46.774 --> 01:49.308
[shouting]

01:49.310 --> 01:51.643
[Christine ]
I can't believe this, Kyle.

01:51.645 --> 01:53.212
Do you ever think of how I feel

01:53.214 --> 01:55.714
when I see you risking your life

01:55.716 --> 01:57.883
jumping from
one skyscraper to another?

01:57.885 --> 01:59.551
If you're watching it online,

01:59.553 --> 02:02.621
it means I survived, right?

02:02.623 --> 02:04.523
At least I think I did.

02:04.525 --> 02:07.326
Hey, it used to excite you.

02:07.328 --> 02:09.328
Yeah, when we were 16.

02:09.330 --> 02:11.463
Wait, how was it again, uh?

02:11.465 --> 02:14.399
If nothing goes right,
go faster.

02:14.401 --> 02:16.335
You know what?

02:16.337 --> 02:18.604
Is that how you deal
with your problems, Kyle?

02:18.606 --> 02:21.773
That's the type of bullshit
Max puts in your brain.

02:21.775 --> 02:23.709
Why do you always have
to bring Max into this?

02:24.645 --> 02:26.912
'Cause if he was a real friend,

02:26.914 --> 02:29.581
he would help you put some
serious money together,

02:29.583 --> 02:33.552
not just
crumbs from a YouTube channel.

02:33.554 --> 02:39.391
Kyle, I think we need, uh
car insurance, health insurance,

02:39.393 --> 02:43.829
Mia's medication, uh we need
to pay our mortgage on time.

02:43.831 --> 02:45.497
The bank manager
doesn't give a shit

02:45.499 --> 02:47.266
about how
many views you're getting

02:47.268 --> 02:49.401
and by the end of the month,
we have an appointment

02:49.403 --> 02:51.937
and you know he's gonna
want to see collateral,

02:51.939 --> 02:54.173
a guarantee,

02:54.175 --> 02:57.543
a steady job with a paycheck,
something normal.

02:58.812 --> 03:01.813
I'm serious this time, Kyle,
if things don't change,

03:01.815 --> 03:04.183
I'm going back to my father's.

03:05.619 --> 03:07.352
And she's coming with me.

03:09.924 --> 03:10.956
Come on, sweetie.

03:13.294 --> 03:15.894
[upbeat music]

[cheering]

03:36.450 --> 03:37.950
[music stops]

03:40.721 --> 03:42.955
[elevator ding]

03:45.559 --> 03:48.293
Let's go get the late comers.

03:54.235 --> 03:56.602
[screaming]

03:58.239 --> 04:00.672
Fail.
I didn't know you were coming.

04:00.674 --> 04:03.642
[chuckles] You really like to
film everything do you, asshole?

04:04.578 --> 04:05.844
You know what this is?

04:06.847 --> 04:09.915
You know what this is, Max, huh?

04:09.917 --> 04:12.351
You guys, you're all the same.

04:12.353 --> 04:14.319
You never know when to quit.

04:14.321 --> 04:17.990
How much
has our poker face here lost?

04:17.992 --> 04:21.860
-[Fail] 19,000. 19,000.
-No, no wait, hey,

04:21.862 --> 04:24.396
-I can win double that.
-[Fail] Really?

04:24.398 --> 04:27.633
-[Max] Yeah, if only--
-[Fail] If only what?
If only what, huh?

04:28.469 --> 04:30.535
If only
we give you another loan, huh?

04:30.537 --> 04:32.604
-30,000.
-30,000.

04:32.606 --> 04:35.440
Just give me 30,000 and I will
give you 10 times as much.

04:35.442 --> 04:38.377
Ten times as much,
you know what?

04:39.480 --> 04:45.717
You have two days to bring
me back my 90,000 plus 10

04:46.820 --> 04:48.587
for raising my blood pressure.

04:49.623 --> 04:52.424
After that,
we'll come and get you

04:53.327 --> 04:56.695
and we'll
take you apart piece by piece.

04:56.697 --> 04:58.597
[cutting sound]

04:58.599 --> 05:01.867
Two days, 100 grand.

05:01.869 --> 05:04.403
Say yes with your head
if you understood.

05:05.039 --> 05:06.705
-You understood?
-Mmm.

05:06.707 --> 05:11.443
Mmm, good, good
for you, Max. Good for you.

05:12.646 --> 05:13.745
[elevator ding]

05:26.593 --> 05:28.427
On top of the world, baby.

05:29.530 --> 05:31.063
Hey, Max.

05:31.065 --> 05:32.497
What's up?

05:34.702 --> 05:36.435
-Oh, Max.
-[Max] Yo.

05:36.437 --> 05:38.437
500,000 subscribers, man.

05:38.439 --> 05:41.640
-[Max] Yeah?
-Yeah, half a million.

05:41.642 --> 05:44.109
Yeah, baby, cool.

05:44.111 --> 05:47.913
We can finally get some good
deals from the sponsors.

05:47.915 --> 05:51.783
Hey, you remember
Jesse, the guy?

05:51.785 --> 05:53.352
Now we can ask
Red Bull to take us on

05:53.354 --> 05:54.853
for official competitions.

05:54.855 --> 05:56.855
[Kyle] This time
we'll get some real cash, man.

05:59.626 --> 06:01.059
[camera clicks]

06:01.061 --> 06:03.061
[Max]
Alright, what's with the face?

06:07.034 --> 06:09.768
Why do you come up here, Kyle?

06:13.707 --> 06:15.607
-To breathe.
-[Max] Exactly.

06:16.910 --> 06:19.044
Could you really stop breathing?

06:21.715 --> 06:23.081
When nothing goes right

06:23.083 --> 06:24.449
[Max] Go faster.

06:25.519 --> 06:27.652
[phone buzzing]

06:27.654 --> 06:28.754
[Max] What's this?

06:28.756 --> 06:30.155
Oh you got it too?

06:31.892 --> 06:33.125
It looks like a video,

06:33.127 --> 06:35.594
but I can't see who sent it.

06:35.596 --> 06:36.828
Man, my phone is frozen.

06:36.830 --> 06:38.029
I can only press play.

06:38.966 --> 06:40.799
[upbeat music]

07:28.749 --> 07:29.748
[Kyle] I don't get it.

07:29.750 --> 07:30.849
Is it an app?

07:30.851 --> 07:32.117
Did it auto-install?

07:33.620 --> 07:34.586
What was that?

07:37.624 --> 07:38.757
Found anything?

07:38.759 --> 07:40.992
Oh, good morning
to you too, Max.

07:40.994 --> 07:44.196
No, no, no website,
no Facebook page.

07:44.198 --> 07:46.832
That logo didn't show up
on any image searches.

07:46.834 --> 07:47.833
I even asked around.

07:47.835 --> 07:49.468
No one knows anything.

07:49.470 --> 07:50.602
It's not for real, man,

07:50.604 --> 07:52.471
this things a big joke.

07:52.473 --> 07:53.805
It's a secret contest.

07:53.807 --> 07:55.774
That's why
we can't find anything.

07:55.776 --> 07:57.075
Right, sure.

07:57.077 --> 07:59.644
And why would
they have chosen us?

07:59.646 --> 08:02.948
They probably
saw our YouTube videos.

08:02.950 --> 08:05.050
They want us because
we're the coolest, dude.

08:06.053 --> 08:10.989
Okay, alright.
So it's a competition
with a 250,000 dollar prize

08:10.991 --> 08:15.494
organized by people with
literally zero online presence.

08:16.263 --> 08:19.231
What makes you so sure that
this thing is for real?

08:19.233 --> 08:22.501
All you've got to do is just
press yes and we'll find out.

08:22.503 --> 08:25.270
And look,
we don't have much time left.

08:26.139 --> 08:27.572
[Mia] Daddy.

08:27.574 --> 08:29.841
-Yes, daddy's here, baby.
-Hey, Mia.

08:31.011 --> 08:32.177
[Kyle] Just a second, good girl.

08:32.179 --> 08:34.279
Hey, man at least let me say hi.

08:34.281 --> 08:38.216
-No, man forget it.
-Why?

08:38.218 --> 08:40.886
Oh come on,
are you ashamed of her uncle?

08:40.888 --> 08:42.621
You're not her uncle.

08:42.623 --> 08:44.856
Anyway, whoever sent this video,

08:44.858 --> 08:46.091
knows what they're doing.

08:47.060 --> 08:48.293
They got our attention.

08:49.196 --> 08:50.228
What are you gonna do?

08:51.265 --> 08:52.864
What are you gonna do?

08:55.969 --> 08:57.569
[flickering sound]

09:03.010 --> 09:04.576
[breaking sound]

09:19.192 --> 09:20.825
[punches]

09:32.706 --> 09:33.939
Hey, hey, hey.

09:39.613 --> 09:40.579
Two days.

09:41.214 --> 09:42.747
You said two days.

09:53.961 --> 09:55.193
[Kyle] What?

09:58.298 --> 10:02.901
[Kyle] Hey, hey, Max.
Max, wake up.

10:06.373 --> 10:08.073
[Max] Why are you here?

10:09.276 --> 10:10.241
[Kyle] What?

10:10.243 --> 10:12.911
If you got me in another
one of your messes...

10:12.913 --> 10:14.913
[light switches flipped on]

10:15.782 --> 10:16.047
No way.

10:20.354 --> 10:21.620
[Kyle] What's going on?

10:21.622 --> 10:23.321
[laughing]

10:23.323 --> 10:25.890
They got us,
that's what's going on.

10:27.227 --> 10:29.227
Great [indistinct] bitch.

10:30.297 --> 10:31.396
[max laughs]

10:32.232 --> 10:33.865
[Kyle] What the...

10:33.867 --> 10:37.669
Oh man, Jesus.

10:37.671 --> 10:40.338
Well, if this is a joke,

10:40.340 --> 10:42.707
you've got to admit,
it's pretty well organized.

10:50.917 --> 10:53.218
Are we supposed to
put this stuff on?

10:53.220 --> 10:55.086
[Kyle] I don't like this, man.

10:55.088 --> 10:56.921
I don't like this one bit.

10:56.923 --> 10:58.657
Let us out of here, huh?

11:01.795 --> 11:03.061
This is kidnapping.

11:03.062 --> 11:04.328
There's no signal in here, man.
Let us out!

11:04.331 --> 11:06.731
[Max] Kyle, hey easy, easy.

11:06.733 --> 11:10.168
Hey, it's true, these guys
is a bit over the top,

11:10.170 --> 11:11.803
but that's show business, right?

11:12.673 --> 11:14.773
-And you remember--
-[Kyle] Get off of me.

11:14.775 --> 11:15.740
[Max] Hey, hey.

11:17.678 --> 11:19.978
Remember the first commandment?

11:19.980 --> 11:22.414
Don't be afraid.

11:22.416 --> 11:27.085
[Henry] Number five
and number six I suppose.

11:28.255 --> 11:31.990
Ah, ah, ah, not so fast.

11:32.793 --> 11:34.092
And you are?

11:34.094 --> 11:36.227
Henry Owl at your disposal.

11:36.229 --> 11:37.729
Oh, before we begin,

11:37.731 --> 11:39.698
please accept my apologies

11:39.700 --> 11:41.199
and those of Black Babylon

11:41.201 --> 11:43.368
if our ways came across
as exceedingly rough.

11:47.007 --> 11:49.274
It was necessary.

11:49.276 --> 11:51.009
Why?

11:51.011 --> 11:53.311
Because our clients
like it that way.

11:53.313 --> 11:57.282
Our procedure is part of
the service package we provide.

11:57.284 --> 11:58.416
And for the same reason,

11:58.418 --> 11:59.451
I'm gonna have to ask you

11:59.453 --> 12:00.385
to hand over your

12:00.387 --> 12:01.953
personal effects,

12:01.955 --> 12:04.355
watches, id-documents,
mobile phones.

12:04.357 --> 12:06.224
[light switch flipped]

12:06.226 --> 12:08.159
You can leave them there.
We'll keep them safe

12:08.161 --> 12:09.761
until the end of the race.

12:11.031 --> 12:13.465
[Kyle chuckles] What? Why?

12:13.467 --> 12:15.166
Because the second commandment

12:15.168 --> 12:18.103
is don't reveal the secret.

12:18.105 --> 12:19.871
It's in the rules.

12:19.873 --> 12:22.974
Is all this legal?

12:22.976 --> 12:25.977
Since when
is that a problem, number five?

12:25.979 --> 12:28.313
It's required
if you wish to participate.

12:28.315 --> 12:30.415
You wouldn't
be the first to quit today.

12:36.223 --> 12:39.190
[Henry]
Your wedding band is to be
considered a personal effect,

12:39.192 --> 12:40.492
number five.

12:42.162 --> 12:44.996
Excellent.
And now for one last formality.

12:48.769 --> 12:50.135
[Kyle] And what's this for?

12:50.137 --> 12:52.470
Well, I can't
exactly say anything,

12:52.472 --> 12:54.806
but I can assure you,

12:54.808 --> 12:56.407
every detail has been arranged

12:56.409 --> 12:58.877
so that
the contest goes perfectly.

13:05.519 --> 13:06.551
Excellent.

13:07.954 --> 13:09.788
[light switch flipped]

13:09.790 --> 13:12.357
[upbeat music]

13:13.393 --> 13:17.862
We officially welcome,
number five and number six.

13:21.368 --> 13:23.935
Why do we have
to wear all these GoPros?

13:23.937 --> 13:27.005
So that the jury can constantly
watch what you're doing.

13:27.007 --> 13:31.209
And so that the spectators
can enjoy the show.

13:31.211 --> 13:33.311
It's a contest with points

13:33.313 --> 13:37.081
and the winner must combine
speed with freestyle moves.

13:37.083 --> 13:39.217
Time of completion
of the course,

13:39.219 --> 13:40.418
athletic ability,

13:40.420 --> 13:42.587
degree of
difficulty of the stunts,

13:42.589 --> 13:47.525
everything will influence
your score, everything.

13:48.428 --> 13:50.428
Where is this being broadcast?

13:50.430 --> 13:52.463
[Kyle] If my wife sees me,
she's gonna freak.

13:53.333 --> 13:56.467
She won't. The show
won't be broadcast anywhere.

13:56.469 --> 13:58.136
[Kyle] So why do all this?

13:58.138 --> 14:01.339
He told us before,
he mentioned clients.

14:01.341 --> 14:03.241
[Henry] Everything that
happens in these woods

14:03.243 --> 14:06.077
will remain
strictly confidential.

14:06.079 --> 14:09.380
Remember, it's a secret contest.

14:10.584 --> 14:13.284
But the money's real, right?

14:13.286 --> 14:15.086
The money
exists only for the one

14:15.088 --> 14:18.590
who beats out all the other
contestants, number five.

14:18.592 --> 14:21.092
And how many
contestants are there?

14:22.896 --> 14:25.496
Ten contestants
divided into pairs.

14:25.498 --> 14:27.332
Five different
points of departure,

14:27.334 --> 14:29.400
but just one finish line.

14:29.402 --> 14:31.569
[laser sounds]

14:39.613 --> 14:42.280
[Henry] The cardio metric
function is now on.

14:42.282 --> 14:43.581
You can monitor your heart rate

14:43.583 --> 14:45.383
by looking at the watch face

14:45.385 --> 14:48.119
so you can
manage your energy optimally.

14:48.121 --> 14:50.154
You can also
check your race data,

14:50.156 --> 14:52.023
updated to the second,

14:52.025 --> 14:55.894
route position,
scores, standings.

14:55.896 --> 14:57.495
You can't live without them.

14:57.497 --> 15:01.132
Well, why don't we all
start in the same place?

15:01.134 --> 15:03.434
Each route
has been specially designed

15:03.436 --> 15:06.037
for each
carefully selected rider.

15:06.039 --> 15:10.642
Different starting places
for different experiences.

15:10.644 --> 15:11.976
All you have to do

15:11.978 --> 15:14.979
is follow the rules and ride.

15:14.981 --> 15:16.915
We've taken care of
everything else.

15:17.584 --> 15:19.584
In case you need it,
the first aid kit

15:19.586 --> 15:22.387
will remind you to respect
the third commandment,

15:25.525 --> 15:28.960
No contestant can assist
another contestant

15:28.962 --> 15:30.695
or provide aid.

15:30.697 --> 15:32.096
[Max] Alright, so tell me

15:32.098 --> 15:34.098
what is the fourth commandment?

15:37.671 --> 15:39.304
I love this guy.

15:40.941 --> 15:44.042
Your helmets are equipped
with wireless intercoms

15:44.044 --> 15:45.576
and for your listening pleasure,

15:45.578 --> 15:49.113
we have created a carefully
selected music playlist,

15:49.115 --> 15:52.150
a personalized
soundtrack if you will

15:52.152 --> 15:55.687
to enhance
each moment of your ride.

15:55.689 --> 15:57.188
That's all for now.

15:58.291 --> 16:00.191
We expect a great deal from you.

16:01.161 --> 16:02.260
Have fun.

16:02.262 --> 16:03.261
Don't let us down.

16:04.297 --> 16:05.630
Enjoy the ride.

16:06.700 --> 16:09.467
[upbeat music]

16:13.640 --> 16:14.639
[cracking sound]

16:35.528 --> 16:38.997
[Max] We're not
in Kansas anymore.

16:38.999 --> 16:39.764
Where are we?

16:39.766 --> 16:43.267
I believe we're
in Europe, my friend.

16:43.269 --> 16:44.535
Those must be the Alps.

16:48.074 --> 16:50.775
Max, you do realize
that these guys

16:50.777 --> 16:52.377
practically kidnapped us

16:52.379 --> 16:54.612
to make us
participate in a contest?

16:54.614 --> 16:57.015
[rallying cry]

16:58.184 --> 16:59.250
You're crazy, man.

17:01.554 --> 17:03.354
[Max] That's why we're friends.

17:04.457 --> 17:06.724
And that's why
Christine is gonna kill me.

17:08.294 --> 17:09.627
Unless I win that is.

17:17.237 --> 17:19.604
-[Max] Ready?
-[Kyle] Never.

17:19.606 --> 17:21.672
[upbeat music]

18:07.187 --> 18:08.586
[rallying cry]

18:38.384 --> 18:40.318
Yo, Kyle you with me?

[sighs]

20:26.693 --> 20:28.392
[exhales]

20:30.597 --> 20:34.532
[Kyle] You are not gonna believe
what I just found.

20:39.606 --> 20:40.938
[buzzing sounds]

20:46.012 --> 20:47.912

[electronic buzzer]

21:06.466 --> 21:07.999

21:13.306 --> 21:14.272
Cool.

21:27.654 --> 21:29.553
[electronic sound]

21:32.358 --> 21:33.758
Awesome.

21:41.868 --> 21:44.035
[electronic buzz]

21:46.539 --> 21:49.640
[Kyle] There's a
little reward for whoever gets
to the checkpoint first.

21:49.642 --> 21:52.810
[Kyle]
You'll see or maybe you won't.

21:52.812 --> 21:55.680

21:57.817 --> 21:59.617

22:20.907 --> 22:24.675
Kyle, I'll come and get you.

[high-pitched electronic sound]

22:32.618 --> 22:34.885
[electronic music]

22:57.043 --> 23:00.778
Woo! What do
you say now, buddy boy?

23:03.449 --> 23:05.416
I can't humiliate
you every ride, Max.

23:05.418 --> 23:06.884
I like the view.

23:06.886 --> 23:09.153
And now if you don't mind--

23:09.155 --> 23:11.922
[upbeat music]

23:37.550 --> 23:38.749
[motorbike engine]

24:00.540 --> 24:03.107
Shit! Hey, Kyle watch out.

24:03.109 --> 24:05.443
There's a crazy guy
on a motorbike.

24:05.445 --> 24:07.812
[Kyle] Okay.
So what? You sound worried?

24:07.814 --> 24:09.713
[Max] I don't know, man.

24:09.715 --> 24:11.015
He tried to bring me down.

24:11.017 --> 24:12.082
[Kyle]
Is it part of the contest?

24:12.084 --> 24:13.951
[Max] No, I don't think so.

24:14.987 --> 24:16.554
[Max] It's not on the GPS.

24:17.824 --> 24:20.057
[Max]
Alright, okay just be careful.

24:22.061 --> 24:24.829
[upbeat music]

24:39.645 --> 24:42.980

24:59.565 --> 25:01.999
[panting]

25:03.035 --> 25:04.635
[Kyle] Ah, shit!

25:04.637 --> 25:05.870
[Max]<i> What happened?</i>

25:05.872 --> 25:07.505
[Kyle] I don't know, some--

25:07.507 --> 25:09.907
some lunatic on a motorcycle.

25:09.909 --> 25:13.110
[Kyle]
Hey, hey, did you see that?

25:13.112 --> 25:14.778
What was that, did you see him?

25:15.781 --> 25:17.515
[grunts]

25:17.517 --> 25:19.049
Oh, [chuckles] God.

25:22.588 --> 25:23.821
[grunting]

25:24.957 --> 25:26.757
[whispering] Okay, okay.

25:28.027 --> 25:29.126
[grunting]

25:30.062 --> 25:31.028
What the--

25:34.767 --> 25:35.833
[Kyle grunting]

25:35.835 --> 25:36.967
[Max] Hey.

25:36.969 --> 25:38.202
[Max] I knew it, man.

25:38.204 --> 25:39.136
[Max] There was something weird

25:39.138 --> 25:40.237
about that guy.

25:40.239 --> 25:43.040
[Max] Oh, nice one.

25:43.042 --> 25:44.909
[Kyle] Shit man, it hurts.

25:44.911 --> 25:46.710
[Max] Give me your kit, come on.

25:48.114 --> 25:49.947
[Max] What's with you? Come on!

25:51.717 --> 25:53.083
[Max] Better not.

25:53.085 --> 25:54.985
[Kyle]
What are you talking about?

25:56.155 --> 25:58.756
[Max] Third commandment,
you heard him.

25:58.758 --> 26:00.991
-[Kyle] Are you serious?
-Yeah.

26:00.993 --> 26:02.259
I don't want to be disqualified.

26:02.261 --> 26:05.029
Oh come on, don't be a wuss.

26:05.031 --> 26:06.230
You can do it yourself.

26:09.268 --> 26:12.236
[beeping]

26:12.238 --> 26:14.038
[Max] Argh!

26:14.040 --> 26:15.906
[panting]

26:17.710 --> 26:21.011
[Kyle] Come on, really?

26:25.051 --> 26:28.152
<i> Hey, it was in touch.</i>

26:28.154 --> 26:30.120
[Kyle groaning]

26:32.091 --> 26:34.291
[beeping]

26:36.896 --> 26:40.664
[continues beeping]

26:44.670 --> 26:46.937
[grunts] Who the hell
was that guy anyway?

26:46.939 --> 26:49.873
-Yes.
-Well, you know what,

26:49.875 --> 26:52.076
must be the final boss.

26:52.078 --> 26:52.943
[laughs]

26:52.945 --> 26:55.179
[beeping]

26:58.117 --> 26:59.617
[beeping speeds up]

27:03.255 --> 27:05.289
Okay, okay.

27:06.659 --> 27:07.625
[Kyle] Thank you.

27:14.233 --> 27:17.935
[Kyle] So what, we just
pretend like nothing happened?

27:17.937 --> 27:21.238
[Max]
Come on, bro, 250,000 bucks.

27:22.341 --> 27:24.975
Did you think they were
just going to give it to us?

27:26.045 --> 27:27.144
[happy cry]

27:35.321 --> 27:37.221
[buzzing]

27:56.342 --> 27:57.808
[speaking Spanish]

27:57.810 --> 27:58.742
[Kyle] Hey, hey, hey.

27:58.744 --> 27:59.910
[speaking Spanish]

28:02.882 --> 28:05.849
[Max] Speak in English,
speak in English.

28:05.851 --> 28:08.852
-[speaking Spanish]
-I don't understand.
English, speak in English.

28:09.722 --> 28:11.822
What is it?

28:13.826 --> 28:16.326
-I'm begging you, help me.
-[Max] Come over here, man.

28:16.328 --> 28:18.062
It's another rider.

28:18.064 --> 28:21.899
[indistinct distressed speech]

28:21.901 --> 28:24.968
[Clara] Help me, help me.

28:24.970 --> 28:26.804
-[Clara] No, we need to
we need to save him.
-[Kyle] Whoa, whoa, whoa,

28:26.806 --> 28:28.272
-[Kyle] What's going on?
-[Max] Save who?

28:28.274 --> 28:29.940
Everything just
happened in a second.

28:29.942 --> 28:32.009
-We need to save Miguel, please!
-Alright, just Stop.

28:32.011 --> 28:34.244
[Kyle] Tell us what happened.
Did he hurt himself or what?

28:34.246 --> 28:38.215
We were taking part in the race
and-- What, you are too?

28:38.217 --> 28:41.251
Tell us, what happened to him?

28:41.253 --> 28:44.822
Someone hit him and made him
fall and he hit his head.

28:44.824 --> 28:47.825
I don't know, he's not moving.
Miguel is not moving!

28:47.827 --> 28:50.360
-[Kyle] Alright,
who did this, who did it?
-I don't know, I don't know.

28:50.362 --> 28:53.464
A guy on a motor bike
dressed in black.

28:53.466 --> 28:56.200
It's him, it's that maniac.

28:56.202 --> 28:58.302
Where is he?
Where can we find him?

28:59.772 --> 29:02.239
I tried but I fell on my bike

29:02.241 --> 29:04.174
and lost my direction.

29:04.176 --> 29:07.377
I remember where it is,
I can take you there.

29:07.379 --> 29:09.346
[Max] Okay, let's go there.

29:09.348 --> 29:11.281
[Kyle] No, no, no, no, no
wait, wait, wait, it's not okay,

29:11.283 --> 29:12.349
<i> wait for a second.</i>

29:12.351 --> 29:13.917
No, you have to--

29:13.919 --> 29:16.086
you have to help me!

29:16.088 --> 29:18.756
Stop, come here, come here.

29:21.327 --> 29:24.194
-I think we should help her.
-Why?

29:24.196 --> 29:26.797
We're connected live to the
organizers of the competition.

29:26.799 --> 29:28.398
They've seen
that someone's got hurt,

29:28.400 --> 29:30.400
that jerk on the motorcycle--

29:30.402 --> 29:32.136
They're gonna take care of it.

29:32.138 --> 29:33.470
You hear that?

29:33.472 --> 29:35.305
Send someone right away.

29:35.307 --> 29:37.374
And let us know, thanks.

29:40.045 --> 29:41.178
Alright,
so what are you thinking?

29:43.115 --> 29:44.848
No one's gonna come, man.

29:44.850 --> 29:46.517
First the fake kidnapping,

29:46.519 --> 29:48.952
then the crazy
motorcyclist, the dark rider

29:48.954 --> 29:50.988
and now
the pretty girl in tears,

29:50.990 --> 29:52.289
the damsel in distress.

29:54.026 --> 29:56.026
Is it not the perfect set up?

29:56.028 --> 29:57.427
Are you serious?

29:57.429 --> 29:59.396
[Max] You know what I noticed,

29:59.398 --> 30:01.331
each time
we stop our points decrease.

30:01.333 --> 30:03.267
[Max]<i> So we either</i>
<i> continue the race</i>

30:03.269 --> 30:04.935
<i> or we go with her.</i>

30:04.937 --> 30:06.403
But we gotta keep going.

30:06.405 --> 30:10.841
Max, Max,
this is not part of the race.

30:10.843 --> 30:12.476
And even if it was,

30:12.478 --> 30:14.845
helping her would be breaking
the third commandment,

30:14.847 --> 30:15.946
wouldn't it, huh?

30:17.817 --> 30:21.151
-You're right.
-You know what, you know what,

30:21.153 --> 30:23.153
we're gonna help her
because she needs it, alright.

30:23.155 --> 30:25.088
Screw all of that
other stuff, okay?

30:26.225 --> 30:28.292
Okay, okay, we're the good guys.

30:28.294 --> 30:29.259
I like it.

30:32.264 --> 30:33.497
Okay, what's your name?

30:36.068 --> 30:38.836
I'm Clara, number nine.

30:38.838 --> 30:41.505
Okay, Clara, take us to Miguel.

30:41.507 --> 30:42.472
Okay.

30:46.478 --> 30:48.278
[Max] Hey, what about the bikes?

30:50.382 --> 30:51.548
[grunts]

30:56.155 --> 30:57.487
[Max grunts]

31:14.006 --> 31:17.341
[Clara] It's here. This is
the place, he's down there.

31:26.952 --> 31:28.352
[Kyle] Is he here?

31:36.295 --> 31:38.161
[Clara] He's here, he's here.

-Get out of here, come on.

32:07.960 --> 32:09.026
[Max]
You said it was an accident!

32:09.028 --> 32:10.460
You said it was an accident!

32:10.462 --> 32:12.296
[muffled sounds]

32:12.298 --> 32:14.464
-What happened?
-[Clara screaming]

32:14.466 --> 32:17.034
-You said it was an accident.
-[Clara] I don't know,
I don't know!

32:17.036 --> 32:19.036
[muffled voices]

32:19.038 --> 32:21.038

Max, we've got to go, come on!

32:21.040 --> 32:23.340
[muffled sounds]

32:23.342 --> 32:26.710
-I should've
never left him here.
-[Kyle] Max!

32:27.646 --> 32:30.681
-[Clara panting]
-[Max] Relax.

32:30.683 --> 32:33.250

Max, we've got to go, come on!

32:47.066 --> 32:48.598
[Clara crying] Miguel.

33:15.995 --> 33:17.728
Max, Max.

33:17.730 --> 33:18.729
[Max] Yeah?

33:18.731 --> 33:19.696
Where you going?

33:19.698 --> 33:20.764
I'm going back.

33:20.766 --> 33:21.732
Back where?

33:23.369 --> 33:24.434
What? Come here!

33:26.171 --> 33:27.471
[Kyle] Where are you going?

33:27.473 --> 33:28.772
[Kyle] Your GPS doesn't work.

33:28.774 --> 33:31.041
[electronic sound]

33:31.043 --> 33:33.276
I don't--
I don't trust her, okay?

33:33.278 --> 33:36.279
-She doesn't feel right to me.
-[Kyle] What about any--

33:36.281 --> 33:38.482
any of this whole
situation feels right?

33:38.484 --> 33:40.317
So what do you want to do, huh?

33:40.319 --> 33:42.219
-You want to stay here?
-I don't know, man.

33:42.221 --> 33:44.788
We can't just keep moving.
We don't know what's out there.

33:44.790 --> 33:48.258
[reverberations]

33:48.260 --> 33:49.226
What was that?

33:52.431 --> 33:53.797
[Clara]
They're telling us where to go.

34:04.443 --> 34:06.209
[single impact sound]

34:07.679 --> 34:09.179
[single impact sound]

34:18.624 --> 34:20.424
[footsteps on camera]

34:20.426 --> 34:23.260
[ominous sound]

34:24.463 --> 34:26.296
[buzzing]

34:34.573 --> 34:35.806
[Clara] It's the checkpoint.

34:35.808 --> 34:37.374
Miguel and I were heading here.

34:37.376 --> 34:40.077
[reverberations]

34:42.748 --> 34:44.147
[single impact sound]

34:45.117 --> 34:47.851
[single impact sound]

34:47.853 --> 34:49.319
[single impact sound]

34:53.192 --> 34:54.491
[single impact sound]

35:06.338 --> 35:07.537
[single impact sound]

35:09.408 --> 35:10.574
[single impact sound]

35:11.510 --> 35:14.711
[electronic sound]

35:28.494 --> 35:30.861
[Kyle muffled voice]
Maybe they've got a phone,
we can use to call for help.

35:31.797 --> 35:34.397
[Kyle] I need some
strong medication for my leg.

35:34.399 --> 35:36.166
[Max] Yeah.

35:36.168 --> 35:39.469
And then we just wave
goodbye to 250,000 dollars.

35:40.639 --> 35:41.638
[Kyle] You're joking, right?

35:42.674 --> 35:44.774
[Max] Let's wait a second, okay.

35:44.776 --> 35:46.910
Maybe the unforeseen situation

35:46.912 --> 35:49.479
has not compromised
the execution of the game.

35:50.449 --> 35:52.516
Screw the game, alright?

35:53.452 --> 35:54.718
[Kyle] You know what?

35:54.720 --> 35:56.253
I'm gonna go find a safe place.

35:56.255 --> 35:57.521
You don't have to come with me.

35:57.523 --> 36:00.157
You go, continue the race,

36:00.159 --> 36:01.691
but don't think you're dragging
me into all this again.

36:01.693 --> 36:02.792
[electronic sound]

36:02.794 --> 36:04.294
[Max] What again mean?

36:06.865 --> 36:10.300
[Max]
Yeah, when nothing goes right,
it's always Max's fault, huh?

36:12.204 --> 36:13.336
[Max] I need that money.

36:14.206 --> 36:15.472
[Kyle] I needed it too.

36:15.474 --> 36:16.873
No man, you don't understand.

36:16.875 --> 36:18.508
Without that money, I'm dead.

36:22.514 --> 36:24.181
I'm in deep shit, Kyle.

36:25.184 --> 36:27.217
I owe a lot
of money to people who--

36:28.353 --> 36:29.352
I've got two days...

36:30.589 --> 36:31.621
and then they'll kill me.

36:32.491 --> 36:34.291
This time for real.

36:34.293 --> 36:36.359
Oh Christ, Max.

36:36.361 --> 36:37.861
I know, I know.

36:37.863 --> 36:39.296
[Max] I'm an asshole.

36:42.234 --> 36:43.934
Christine was clear this time,

36:45.637 --> 36:47.571
either I straighten
things out at home...

36:49.374 --> 36:50.373
or she's leaving.

36:51.743 --> 36:53.276
She's taking Mia with her.

36:58.984 --> 37:00.233
There's no happy ending.

37:00.234 --> 37:01.483
I think karma's telling us
to get steady jobs, man.

37:08.994 --> 37:10.594
You win.

37:10.596 --> 37:11.962
Let's go to the green room.

37:26.945 --> 37:28.411
Are you coming?

37:39.024 --> 37:42.626
Hey, there are two other
riders headed there too.

37:43.595 --> 37:44.794
Shouldn't be long now.

37:48.500 --> 37:50.000
Are you okay?

37:50.002 --> 37:51.901
[Max] Was that your boyfriend?

37:53.772 --> 37:56.506
[Max]
Have you seen other checkpoints
around here or something?

37:58.010 --> 37:58.975
[Kyle] Hey, Clara,

38:00.312 --> 38:02.012
I'm Kyle, by the way.

38:02.014 --> 38:04.881
[buzzing sound]

38:05.851 --> 38:07.017
[Max] This'll all be okay.

38:09.354 --> 38:11.988
[ominous music]

38:22.401 --> 38:23.633
I don't get it.

38:23.635 --> 38:24.701
[Max] What?

38:25.871 --> 38:27.470
[Kyle] It says rider number two

38:27.472 --> 38:29.039
should be around here somewhere.

38:34.012 --> 38:35.078
-[Kyle] Watch out!
-[Max] Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

38:35.080 --> 38:36.313
Look at this.

38:39.051 --> 38:40.884
[Max] These bastards.

38:40.886 --> 38:43.386
[electronic sound]

38:50.395 --> 38:51.995
[Kyle] Oh shit.

38:56.535 --> 38:58.635
[Kyle] Oh, um.

39:00.572 --> 39:01.838
Oh, hu--

39:03.975 --> 39:05.408
[Max] Oh shit, oh shit.

39:05.410 --> 39:07.677
Don't look, don't look.

39:07.679 --> 39:09.346
-[Kyle] Get in the path.
-[Clara] We're next.

39:09.348 --> 39:11.815
[Kyle groaning]

39:11.817 --> 39:13.917
[Kyle] Don't look at it, don't
look at it, don't look at it.

39:13.919 --> 39:17.620
[Kyle]
Max, Max where are you going?

39:17.622 --> 39:19.622
[Kyle] Max, this is
a good reason to stop.

39:19.624 --> 39:21.358
It's another rider, man.

39:21.360 --> 39:23.660
[Max] That is a good reason
to go to the green room.

39:24.996 --> 39:25.962
You were right.

39:32.137 --> 39:34.003
[buzzing sound]

39:44.015 --> 39:45.982
[single impact sound]

39:45.984 --> 39:48.051
[buzzing]

39:53.925 --> 39:55.492
[single impact sound]

40:00.432 --> 40:03.166
[electronic vibrating sound]

40:03.168 --> 40:05.034
[Kyle] The green room
should be right here.

40:07.038 --> 40:07.737
[Clara] It must be up here.

40:12.511 --> 40:14.544
[Max]
All the other riders are gone.

40:15.714 --> 40:16.913
We're the only ones left.

40:25.457 --> 40:28.758
[Max] Hey, you gonna do this?

40:29.661 --> 40:30.727
Yeah.

40:34.132 --> 40:36.633
[heart beats]

40:42.974 --> 40:45.175
[heartbeats]

40:54.653 --> 40:56.753
[heartbeats fasten]

41:09.501 --> 41:10.600
[banging on door]

41:17.075 --> 41:19.843
[Max] Why would they
send us here if we can't get in?

41:24.716 --> 41:27.617
Maybe it's old like some, uh...

41:29.187 --> 41:31.221
old self activating
security measure.

41:34.726 --> 41:36.826
[Kyle]
I thought this was a new show.

41:46.037 --> 41:47.604
[door opening]

41:51.776 --> 41:53.076
[Max] Hello?

41:58.016 --> 41:59.582
Hey, we're here.

42:04.856 --> 42:05.989
[Kyle] Hello?

42:05.991 --> 42:07.557
[Max] Is that a phone there?

42:10.929 --> 42:13.263
[Max] Hey, is that working?

42:13.265 --> 42:14.597
It's dead.

42:20.872 --> 42:23.139
-[Max] What is this?
-[Clara] I don't know.

42:25.043 --> 42:27.777
[Clara] No, no,
we shouldn't touch anything
We should not touch anything.

42:27.779 --> 42:28.878
[Max] Let me
try to do something.

42:28.880 --> 42:29.946
[Clara] No, no, we--

42:29.948 --> 42:33.316
-[Max] Something--
-I'm sure someone will
come here in a second.

42:33.318 --> 42:35.618
-If we just wait here--
-[Max] Let me try
and see what I can do.

42:35.620 --> 42:37.587
No, we don't know what this is.
We don't know what this is.

42:37.589 --> 42:39.222
-Hey!
-[Kyle] Max, hey!

42:41.960 --> 42:43.960
Stop, alright?

42:43.962 --> 42:44.928
Come here.

42:53.338 --> 42:54.604
[Max]
We got to do something, alright?

42:55.774 --> 42:57.574
[Max] It's been a long day.

42:58.310 --> 42:59.275
Easy now.

43:01.646 --> 43:03.613
[Kyle] It's connected.
The phone is connected to the--

43:10.355 --> 43:12.055
[Max] That's right.

43:12.057 --> 43:14.290
[beeping]

43:18.363 --> 43:19.362
[Max] Yes.

43:22.133 --> 43:23.733
There must be something.

43:30.342 --> 43:32.175
[loud switch]

43:34.379 --> 43:36.045
[Kyle] There we go.

43:36.047 --> 43:38.381
[Max] The system is restarting.

43:38.383 --> 43:39.382
Okay.

43:39.384 --> 43:43.119
-[Kyle] I'm gonna
go find something for my leg.
-[Max] Alright.

43:43.121 --> 43:45.088
There's an infirmary back here.

44:01.940 --> 44:04.741
[panting]

44:07.112 --> 44:09.746
Hey come on,
it'll make you good.

44:19.824 --> 44:21.858
[Kyle] Yeah, yeah, yeah.

44:27.265 --> 44:29.232
What's Mia like now?

44:31.202 --> 44:32.669
[Kyle] She's a handful.

44:33.838 --> 44:35.738
[Max] You never tell
me anything about her.

44:37.042 --> 44:39.208
You know
why Christine is so angry at me?

44:40.812 --> 44:42.779
Why she wants me
to stop with all this?

44:44.282 --> 44:45.415
Three years ago,

44:46.418 --> 44:48.351
Berlin.

44:48.353 --> 44:50.086
[Max] Yeah, I remember.

44:50.088 --> 44:51.454
You got really messed up.

44:54.292 --> 44:55.992
You were off for two months.

44:57.762 --> 44:59.395
If I close my eyes,
I can still see it.

44:59.397 --> 45:05.001
Dumbest mistakes.
I land with just a little too
much force in my handlebars

45:05.003 --> 45:07.437
and the front wheel buckles.

45:08.773 --> 45:10.406
And I remember
thinking to myself...

45:12.277 --> 45:14.977
You're probably gonna fall
right now and break your neck

45:15.847 --> 45:18.915
and there isn't a camera in
the right angle to catch it.

45:20.785 --> 45:22.118
[laughs]

45:23.254 --> 45:26.389
Wow, what would that be like...

45:27.826 --> 45:29.292
to film my own death?

45:32.130 --> 45:33.362
[Kyle] Helicopter comes,

45:34.499 --> 45:37.433
compound fracture
to my hip and my femur

45:38.903 --> 45:40.770
and they operate, and

45:40.772 --> 45:43.072
three hours later I wake up

45:43.074 --> 45:46.242
and Mia has decided to
come out two weeks early.

45:52.283 --> 45:55.051
[Kyle]
You know sometimes I look at her
and I wonder maybe if she knows

45:56.888 --> 45:58.154
that I wasn't there.

46:01.092 --> 46:04.527
And now I'm in this mess
and I might never see 'em again.

46:04.529 --> 46:07.029
[beeping]

46:08.166 --> 46:09.398
You'll see them.

46:10.301 --> 46:12.001
[electronic sound]

46:13.304 --> 46:14.403
-[beeps]
-Yes, I've got a line.

46:14.405 --> 46:16.873
Who are you calling, the police?

46:18.076 --> 46:19.976
[Clara]
We don't even know where we are.

46:19.978 --> 46:23.045
In those mountains we saw of
the alps, then we're in Europe.

46:23.047 --> 46:24.447
[Max]
The emergency number is 112.

46:25.784 --> 46:28.184
[calling tone]

46:29.053 --> 46:30.820
[operator]
<i> 112, what's your emergency?</i>

46:30.822 --> 46:32.822
[Max] Yeah, we need help.

46:32.824 --> 46:34.924
-Uh, we have
three people trapped in a fort.
<i> -Okay.</i>

46:34.926 --> 46:37.326
-Some dead bodies. We need--
<i> -Okay, try to calm down, sir.</i>

46:37.328 --> 46:38.828
<i> I need to know</i>
<i> where you are first.</i>

46:38.830 --> 46:40.429
<i> -Where are you?</i>
-No, no, no, we, we--

46:40.431 --> 46:43.132
We don't know exactly where we
are. We can't say that.

46:43.134 --> 46:44.934
<i> Okay, what do you mean, sir?</i>
<i> Are you lost?</i>

46:44.936 --> 46:46.836
-No, we're not lost.
<i> -To send help need to know--</i>

46:46.838 --> 46:50.540
We just, we can't say,
Can you please trace the call?

46:50.542 --> 46:53.309
[operator]<i> Yes, we can do that.</i>
<i> Just give me a second.</i>

46:53.311 --> 46:55.344
<i> In the meantime, tell me</i>
<i> precisely what happened</i>

46:55.346 --> 46:56.412
<i> and how you found the body.</i>

46:56.414 --> 46:58.147
[Max] We don't know either.

46:58.149 --> 47:00.249
Someone hacked into this,
this is not the point.

47:00.251 --> 47:02.985
<i> -Okay.</i>
-You should send someone here.
We just down break.

47:02.987 --> 47:04.887
<i> Tracing the call.</i>

47:04.889 --> 47:06.455
<i> We can't reach that area</i>
<i> with my helicopter,</i>

47:06.457 --> 47:08.958
<i> but an extraction center</i>
<i> with an ER complication</i>

47:08.960 --> 47:11.060
-What, say again--
<i> -and if you have a GPS,</i>
<i> these are the coordinates,</i>

47:12.964 --> 47:16.032
<i> -22, 42</i>
-[Max] Shit!

47:16.034 --> 47:17.567
What happened?
Did they trace the call?

47:17.569 --> 47:19.001
-[Kyle] Are they coming here?
-Max] I don't know.

47:19.003 --> 47:20.970
-[alarm]
-[Clara] You [indistinct]

47:22.207 --> 47:23.573
We don't even know where we are.

47:23.575 --> 47:25.208
[alarm blaring]

47:27.212 --> 47:30.546
-[Max] What is wrong?
-[Clara] They want to trap us
here to kill us all.

47:30.548 --> 47:32.615
[alarm blaring]

47:32.617 --> 47:34.150
[Kyle] Open this door.

47:37.388 --> 47:38.421
[Kyle] Where are you going?

47:38.423 --> 47:40.156
[electronic sound]

47:40.158 --> 47:42.291
[alarm blaring]

47:42.293 --> 47:45.027
Where did she go?
Where'd she go?

47:45.029 --> 47:46.963
[Max] I don't know man,
she went there.

47:46.965 --> 47:48.865
[Kyle] Oh no, no, no, no.

47:48.867 --> 47:51.500
[alarm blaring]

47:56.241 --> 47:58.274
[Kyle] She called
the cops straight here.

47:58.276 --> 48:00.409
[Max] No, we're not
gonna wait here, okay?

48:00.411 --> 48:02.612
[panting]

48:02.614 --> 48:04.146
[Kyle] Max!

Hey, what do you want from us?

49:20.425 --> 49:21.490
Run, run!

49:22.327 --> 49:24.293
[Clara] Help, help me!

49:26.064 --> 49:28.130
[Clara] Help, help me!

49:30.401 --> 49:32.268
-Hurry up now.
-[Clara screaming]

49:33.738 --> 49:36.639
This way, this way.

49:36.641 --> 49:38.374
What are you doing? Let's go!

49:38.376 --> 49:40.142
[screaming]

49:44.382 --> 49:46.115
[Max] We've got to go!

49:46.117 --> 49:49.719
We've got to move, right now,
what are you doing?

49:49.721 --> 49:50.720
[Max] What are you doing?

49:51.756 --> 49:54.056
[laughing]

50:13.778 --> 50:15.711
[light switch flips on]

50:16.581 --> 50:18.381
Hey, hey, Kyle.

50:18.383 --> 50:20.249
[Max] Kyle, wake up.

50:20.251 --> 50:21.250
[Kyle] Why?

50:22.687 --> 50:25.287
-[Kyle] What happened?
-[Max] I don't know.

50:25.289 --> 50:26.188
I just woke up.

50:26.190 --> 50:27.723
Clara is one of them.

50:27.725 --> 50:29.225
One of them who?

50:29.227 --> 50:30.426
[Max] This was all a set up.

50:30.428 --> 50:31.560
You understand me now?

50:31.562 --> 50:33.662
What was all a set up?

50:33.664 --> 50:35.398
[light switch flips]

50:41.406 --> 50:43.639
Well rested?

50:43.641 --> 50:46.609
You were
faking it the whole time.

50:46.611 --> 50:49.311
Everyone needs to play their
role in the big show, Max.

50:49.313 --> 50:52.114
[Max] And you let him smash
your face, you're sick.

50:53.051 --> 50:55.184
[Clara] Sometimes things
get a little heavy.

50:55.186 --> 50:57.787
We need to be very convincing

50:57.789 --> 50:59.355
otherwise it doesn't work.

50:59.357 --> 51:02.758
[Max] What, what doesn't work?

51:02.760 --> 51:05.494
Let us go, you psychos.

51:06.764 --> 51:08.464
Of course we'll let you go.

51:13.204 --> 51:14.670
Are you religious?

51:16.641 --> 51:19.308
Don't you know you must
obey the commandments?

51:19.310 --> 51:21.444
Yes, we need help.

51:21.446 --> 51:24.613
Uh, we have three people trapped
in a fort, some dead bodies.

51:24.615 --> 51:26.148
We need someone--

51:26.150 --> 51:28.384
Can you please trace the call?

51:28.386 --> 51:29.819
[Clara] No.

51:29.821 --> 51:32.188
-[loud beep]
-No, no, no.

51:32.190 --> 51:34.290
-[voice on video tape continues]
-That's against the rules.

51:34.292 --> 51:36.225
Hey, I didn't say anything.

51:36.227 --> 51:37.793
I didn't reveal the secret.

51:37.795 --> 51:39.128
Shh, shh, shh, shh,

51:39.130 --> 51:41.697
shh, shh, shh, shh.

51:43.301 --> 51:47.169
Then once you break the rules,
you found the flames of chaos.

51:47.171 --> 51:49.105
[rumbling sound]

51:52.543 --> 51:56.512
[chuckles]
But don't worry,
you won't be disqualified.

51:56.514 --> 51:58.781
Consider this your punishment...

52:00.751 --> 52:02.384
Or a penalty if you prefer.

52:05.890 --> 52:08.757
Red pill for number six.

52:08.759 --> 52:10.593
[grunts]

52:10.595 --> 52:13.329
[alarm sounds]

52:15.166 --> 52:17.166
It won't take long to work.

52:17.168 --> 52:19.668
[Clara] If we're lucky,
we're gonna have some fun.

52:21.639 --> 52:23.606
[screaming]

52:25.510 --> 52:27.877
[Clara]<i> Help me,</i>
<i> help me, please help me!</i>

52:30.548 --> 52:32.214
<i> Help me!</i>

52:32.216 --> 52:35.451
[Clara] Uh oh, uh oh.

52:35.453 --> 52:36.919
[beeping]

52:36.921 --> 52:39.922
A penalty
of 1,000 points for number six.

52:39.924 --> 52:42.224
Why, huh?

52:42.226 --> 52:43.726
Why are you doing this to us?

52:43.728 --> 52:47.363
[Clara]
Fear, hate, frustration, rage,

52:47.365 --> 52:50.432
they all need
to pulse through your veins

52:50.434 --> 52:55.237
so that you can satisfy
the needs of our audience.

52:56.707 --> 53:00.376
We want to excite you,
to excite us.

53:01.412 --> 53:04.446
You should
be proud of yourself that
you made it to the second phase.

53:04.448 --> 53:07.516
[loud vibration sound]

53:07.518 --> 53:08.784
[alarm blaring]

53:11.522 --> 53:13.889
[loud excruciating sound]

53:14.892 --> 53:15.958
[noise stops]

53:15.960 --> 53:19.862
<i>But the show must always go on.</i>

53:21.699 --> 53:23.966
[Max] Hey, hey!

53:23.968 --> 53:25.234
[groaning]

53:26.571 --> 53:29.572
[retching]

53:29.574 --> 53:31.507
[grating sound]

53:35.713 --> 53:37.746
-[buzzing sound]
-Henry Owl at your disposal.

53:37.748 --> 53:41.984
What you just inhaled
is a sort of incentive

53:41.986 --> 53:43.219
to participate,

53:43.221 --> 53:45.321
to not rip off your cameras,

53:45.323 --> 53:48.691
to run, but not run away.

53:48.693 --> 53:50.693
The compound
spreading through your system

53:50.695 --> 53:54.496
is a mixture of
tetrodotoxin and saxitoxin,

53:54.498 --> 53:56.799
an injection
with a few milligrams

53:56.801 --> 53:58.534
would've killed you too quickly.

53:58.536 --> 54:00.536
Making the substance gaseous

54:00.538 --> 54:02.972
and mixing
with a thiosulfate solution

54:02.974 --> 54:05.407
has earned us more time.

54:05.409 --> 54:07.476
So you poisoned us?

54:07.478 --> 54:09.778
I know, it may sound ridiculous.

54:09.780 --> 54:12.348
It's so '80s, isn't it?

54:12.350 --> 54:15.317
The poison will
act in the following way.

54:15.319 --> 54:18.520
It starts with shortness
of breath, blurred vision

54:18.522 --> 54:21.323
and a dulling
of the other senses.

54:21.325 --> 54:25.527
Tinnitus, irregular heartbeat
and gradual paralysis,

54:25.529 --> 54:28.697
vomiting, convulsions
and ultimately

54:28.699 --> 54:30.899
cardiorespiratory failure.

54:30.901 --> 54:34.970
All this of course
unless you take the antidote.

54:34.972 --> 54:38.774
-What antidote?
-It's at the finish line
waiting for you

54:38.776 --> 54:43.612
or rather waiting for
one of you, the winner.

54:45.316 --> 54:46.649
Three main checkpoints,

54:46.651 --> 54:48.651
two plus the final one.

54:48.653 --> 54:50.352
Same rules as before apply,

54:50.354 --> 54:52.921
but with one small sexy tweak.

54:52.923 --> 54:54.890
At the end of the competition,

54:54.892 --> 54:57.393
one of you will die.

54:57.395 --> 54:58.794
[Clara] This is a show,

54:58.796 --> 55:00.429
a very ancient one

55:00.431 --> 55:03.866
and no one
can break the tradition.

55:03.868 --> 55:06.602
-Enjoy the ride.
-Enjoy the ride.

55:06.604 --> 55:08.704
[unlocking sound]

55:08.706 --> 55:10.072
[panting]

55:14.779 --> 55:16.612
[upbeat music]

55:58.456 --> 56:01.423
[Clara]
<i>The show is a collective ritual,</i>

56:01.425 --> 56:04.360
<i>a reciprocal exchange of energy.</i>

56:04.362 --> 56:08.664
<i> You are the vehicle</i>
<i> of that energy.</i>

56:08.666 --> 56:12.835
<i> You are</i>
<i> the black Babylon riders.</i>

56:14.004 --> 56:15.904
[upbeat music]

56:19.910 --> 56:21.043
Are you out of your mind?

56:21.045 --> 56:22.745
So what do we do now?

56:23.581 --> 56:25.080
You heard her, right?

56:25.082 --> 56:26.949
She's probably
listening to us right now,

56:26.951 --> 56:28.584
we have no choice, man,
we have to race.

56:28.586 --> 56:29.885
[Kyle] Oh so you think

56:29.887 --> 56:32.421
this is still
a competition, huh?

56:32.423 --> 56:34.690
And that only one of us is
gonna make it back home?

56:34.692 --> 56:39.395
[Max] For Christ's sake.
These maniacs have
proven time and time again

56:39.397 --> 56:41.797
they have no problems doing what
they say they're going to do.

56:41.799 --> 56:46.402
And you don't
have a problem with the fact
that one of us is gonna die.

56:46.404 --> 56:47.870
You saw those bodies.

56:47.872 --> 56:49.438
We need to do what they tell us,

56:49.440 --> 56:50.906
otherwise, we're
gonna end up like that.

56:50.908 --> 56:53.475
Earlier on the phone,

56:53.477 --> 56:55.043
did the police
tell you anything?

56:55.045 --> 56:56.645
Did they tell you how to
get out of here, what?

56:56.647 --> 56:59.615
No. The line went dead
before I could hear them.

56:59.617 --> 57:01.717
And anyway, don't you think
they're gonna catch you?

57:01.719 --> 57:04.753
-Christ!
-What about the poison?

57:04.755 --> 57:07.556
Are you willing to risk not
getting back to your daughter?

57:11.695 --> 57:14.496
You don't want to escape,
do you?

57:15.566 --> 57:17.199
You haven't wanted to
escape for a single second.

57:18.736 --> 57:20.869
And now you're using my daughter
to convince me to race.

57:20.871 --> 57:23.939
-What?
-You're manipulating me, Max,
like you've always done.

57:23.941 --> 57:29.445
Kyle! If I don't
get that money, I'm dead.

57:31.015 --> 57:32.648
Then you're
crazier than they are.

57:34.218 --> 57:35.884
You can't
see past your own needs,

57:35.886 --> 57:38.020
your own debt,
your own problems.

57:38.022 --> 57:40.122
I did this for my family,
I'm here for them.

57:40.124 --> 57:41.223
[Max] Nah.

57:41.225 --> 57:42.524
Oh you want to see my daughter

57:42.526 --> 57:43.826
grow up without her father?

57:43.828 --> 57:45.727
Please don't
give me a sob story, man.

57:45.729 --> 57:48.664
If you really cared about her,
you wouldn't be here.

57:53.904 --> 57:55.737
You weren't even there
the day she was born.

57:55.739 --> 57:57.139
[Kyle] Oh shut up, man.

57:57.141 --> 57:58.907
[Max] The only time
you speak about her

57:58.909 --> 58:00.943
you make it sound
like she's a problem.

58:00.945 --> 58:02.144
[grunting]

58:02.146 --> 58:03.912
You said it yourself,

58:03.914 --> 58:05.247
you need to breath

58:05.249 --> 58:06.548
otherwise you'd end up

58:06.550 --> 58:08.150
suffocating in that house.

58:11.055 --> 58:13.155
I'll see you
at the finish line, Max.

58:13.157 --> 58:15.023
[upbeat music]

58:29.707 --> 58:31.073

[Clara]<i> Tick tock, tick tock.</i>

58:35.045 --> 58:36.678
<i>We've got our eyes on you, Max.</i>

58:37.748 --> 58:39.047
[Max] It's the shit
you made me swallow.

58:41.218 --> 58:42.718
It's starting to kick in.

I'm not gonna play your games.

[Max] Do you know
why they gave me this, Kyle?

1:22:15.264 --> 1:22:16.330
[Max laughs]

1:22:18.935 --> 1:22:21.502
[Max] For the same reason they
probably gave you a bullet.

1:22:24.040 --> 1:22:26.006
[Max]
They want a classic showdown.

1:22:27.343 --> 1:22:29.143
They won't release the antidote

1:22:29.145 --> 1:22:32.346
until one of our hearts
has stopped beating

1:22:32.348 --> 1:22:35.716
or at least that's what
they want us to believe.

1:22:35.718 --> 1:22:38.519
I don't care what your
deal is with them, Max.

1:22:38.521 --> 1:22:39.720
They're gonna hurt Mia

1:22:39.722 --> 1:22:42.656

1:22:49.999 --> 1:22:51.598

you were not there.

1:23:00.576 --> 1:23:04.511

because we thought
you'd be really pissed off.

[Kyle]
Of all the people in the world,

1:23:05.715 --> 1:23:07.448
why did she call you?

1:23:09.452 --> 1:23:12.019
Look what they did to us.

1:23:12.021 --> 1:23:17.324
We are the perfect
candidates for this game.

1:23:18.661 --> 1:23:20.527
Yeah, that's it,
that's the point.

1:23:20.529 --> 1:23:24.398

So they are asking us to choose

1:23:24.400 --> 1:23:25.699
who the winner should be.

1:23:25.701 --> 1:23:27.568
I'm telling you, man,
it has to be me.

1:23:27.570 --> 1:23:30.671
You go home, I get my money.

1:23:30.673 --> 1:23:33.007
It's a happy ending, Kyle.

Of course I'm right,
