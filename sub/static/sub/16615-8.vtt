12:00.919 --> 12:02.887
Because we both know what it's like

12:02.912 --> 12:05.955
to care about someone
who always lets us down...

12:06.162 --> 12:07.161
your sister...

12:07.186 --> 12:08.158
Gold.

12:08.193 --> 12:11.995
Right? I will not let my son
go through all this, okay?

12:12.572 --> 12:14.985
You can get us out of Storybrooke.

12:15.010 --> 12:17.233
I have seen you make portals before.

12:19.122 --> 12:20.422
Even if I said yes,

12:20.447 --> 12:22.939
I can't help you without
the sorcerer's wand,

12:22.974 --> 12:25.642
and your scaly husband
has it under lock and key.

12:26.548 --> 12:28.016
Well, then it's a good thing

12:28.041 --> 12:30.275
I know just the person
to get it from him.

12:32.145 --> 12:33.378
Are you serious?

12:33.424 --> 12:35.591
You want us to steal a
wand from the Dark One?

12:35.616 --> 12:38.031
No. I want <i> him</i> to steal a wand.

12:38.399 --> 12:40.251
He is supposed to be
the best thief in town.

12:40.287 --> 12:43.254
Best thief in <i> any</i>
town, just to be clear.

12:43.569 --> 12:45.390
Jasmine: [Scoffs] You can't do this.

12:45.425 --> 12:48.116
You need to help me
find Agrabah, our home.

12:48.342 --> 12:50.929
This is a suicide mission

12:50.964 --> 12:52.464
which has nothing to do with you.

12:52.499 --> 12:54.299
Actually, it's got <i>
everything</i> to do with him.

12:54.334 --> 12:55.333
Sorry. Who are you?

12:55.369 --> 12:57.135
See, those Golden Shear thingies...

12:57.170 --> 12:59.070
The only reason they're
even in Storybrooke

12:59.106 --> 13:00.572
is because of your boyfriend.

13:00.607 --> 13:01.503
Uh... Actually, we're...

13:01.528 --> 13:02.409
We're not exactly...

13:02.434 --> 13:03.526
Yeah, I don't care.

13:03.551 --> 13:06.188
See, when you tried to play
hero giving them to Emma,

13:06.213 --> 13:09.514
like most acts of idiotic
heroism, it failed,

13:09.549 --> 13:11.049
and now Rumple's got them.

13:11.084 --> 13:12.951
Okay, I don't like this one.

13:12.986 --> 13:15.086
You really think that this is my fault?

13:16.413 --> 13:18.156
I think that you used to be the Savior.

13:18.562 --> 13:21.693
And if there's any part
of you that's still a hero,

13:21.728 --> 13:25.730
then you are gonna help
me escape from this beast.

13:25.766 --> 13:27.932
[Footsteps approaching]

13:32.806 --> 13:35.707
Never thought I'd see you
in a pantsuit, Your Majesty.

13:35.742 --> 13:36.808
[Laughs]

13:36.843 --> 13:40.211
Guess you can't trick the Dark One.

13:40.572 --> 13:42.682
But...

13:42.707 --> 13:47.210
we can pretend I was Regina...

13:49.887 --> 13:51.634
if you want to.

13:52.859 --> 13:55.960
Not today. I have work.

13:58.100 --> 13:59.431
[Clears throat] Fine.

13:59.466 --> 14:01.037
Back to work, then...

14:01.062 --> 14:03.229
as soon as I get what I need.

14:03.553 --> 14:06.078
And I can assure you,
it's not the pillow talk.

14:06.106 --> 14:09.207
The Hammer of Hephaestus.

14:09.242 --> 14:10.241
Heard of it?

14:10.277 --> 14:11.643
Well, that's curious.

14:11.678 --> 14:16.881
The hammer's magic is useful
to those who have none.

14:16.917 --> 14:18.083
Why would you need it?

14:18.762 --> 14:20.852
It's a little gift...

14:20.887 --> 14:23.088
from a mother to her son.

14:23.613 --> 14:25.423
So the curse wasn't enough?

14:25.459 --> 14:27.258
Now you want a family.

14:27.294 --> 14:28.660
I'd be careful with that.

14:28.695 --> 14:31.362
You know... villains
don't get happy endings.

14:31.398 --> 14:33.472
I'm not looking for an <i> ending.</i>

14:35.527 --> 14:37.108
I'm looking...

14:38.803 --> 14:40.389
for a <i> beginning.</i>

14:44.277 --> 14:46.077
[Sighs]

14:53.120 --> 14:54.886
Gold: All right, then.

14:55.613 --> 14:57.021
To new beginnings.

15:01.458 --> 15:03.728
Now, what do <i> you</i>
have to offer <i> me?</i>

15:04.110 --> 15:05.954
What I have to offer you...

15:07.649 --> 15:11.936
is, now we're on the same team.

15:13.966 --> 15:15.829
Aren't we?

15:18.812 --> 15:22.514
Just remember your mother's lesson...

15:22.549 --> 15:25.316
Love is weakness.

15:27.287 --> 15:30.655
Love can be weakness,

15:30.690 --> 15:32.791
but it can also be a weapon.

15:32.826 --> 15:37.061
And I'm about to use
that weapon on my son.

15:39.936 --> 15:40.751
It's me again.

15:40.793 --> 15:42.126
I'm sorry for leaving so many messages,

15:42.154 --> 15:45.339
but from what I recall, phones
still function in New York City.

15:45.364 --> 15:47.211
Please use yours and get back to me.

15:47.236 --> 15:49.599
Something doesn't feel right.

15:50.290 --> 15:51.368
[Cellphone beeps]

15:58.249 --> 16:00.349
[Cellphone rings]

16:06.079 --> 16:09.514
You're pretty clever for a pirate.

16:09.549 --> 16:11.449
What have you done with Emma and Regina?

16:11.485 --> 16:13.151
That's an excellent question,

16:13.186 --> 16:15.820
but one I'm not going to answer.

16:15.856 --> 16:17.388
- [Whoosh]
- Aah!

16:20.393 --> 16:22.127
Anything?

16:22.162 --> 16:23.835
Uh, no. Not yet.

16:23.860 --> 16:25.259
- You?
- Nothing.

16:25.432 --> 16:26.431
Keep looking.

16:26.466 --> 16:27.354
Even if we find someone,

16:27.379 --> 16:29.212
what does it matter if
we can't talk to them?

16:29.469 --> 16:30.468
It's like you said.

16:30.504 --> 16:32.637
Henry... he won't give up.

16:32.672 --> 16:34.172
He will figure this out.

16:34.207 --> 16:35.725
And when they try to break us out,

16:35.750 --> 16:37.894
we have to be at the exact right mirror

16:37.919 --> 16:39.485
at the exact right time.

16:40.080 --> 16:42.180
[Funky music plays] Oww! Mm! Yeah.

16:42.215 --> 16:44.883
Why isn't anyone useful
looking into a mirror right now?

16:44.918 --> 16:45.884
Granny's.

16:45.919 --> 16:47.085
Granny's?

16:47.120 --> 16:49.387
That's where Henry's taking
Violet before the dance.

17:11.077 --> 17:13.243
[Sighs]

17:23.790 --> 17:24.753
He looks so grown up.

17:24.779 --> 17:26.255
Oh.

17:26.492 --> 17:28.193
He's terrified.

17:28.556 --> 17:30.169
Okay, what's next?

17:31.587 --> 17:32.897
Try anything.

17:33.441 --> 17:35.841
Henry?! Henry?!

17:36.024 --> 17:38.191
[Thumping]

17:43.410 --> 17:45.410
Henry! Henry, we're right here!

17:45.445 --> 17:47.212
[Thumping]

17:47.247 --> 17:49.330
Evil Regina: Henry, are you back here?

17:49.355 --> 17:50.588
Uh, yeah.

17:50.717 --> 17:51.649
Hey, Mom.

17:51.685 --> 17:53.551
Hey.

17:53.587 --> 17:55.653
I thought you might need to talk.

17:55.689 --> 17:56.784
[Sighs]

17:56.809 --> 18:00.043
You've got to be kidding me.

18:00.594 --> 18:02.627
He really thinks that's me.

18:02.662 --> 18:04.996
He has no idea we're even gone.

18:05.031 --> 18:06.931
Tell me... what's wrong?

18:10.804 --> 18:12.804
It's Violet.

18:12.839 --> 18:15.373
I don't think I'm
good enough for Violet.

18:15.408 --> 18:17.408
[Scoffs] Henry.

18:17.444 --> 18:20.278
Violet might be a nice
girl, but she's a commoner,

18:20.313 --> 18:22.880
and she's lucky to
have a prince like you.

18:22.916 --> 18:24.949
I'm not a prince.

18:24.985 --> 18:27.685
I'm just a middle schooler
wearing Grandpa's tie.

18:27.721 --> 18:29.398
Now, don't sell yourself short, Henry.

18:29.423 --> 18:30.521
Never do that.

18:30.557 --> 18:33.591
You will always be royalty no
matter what world you live in.

18:33.627 --> 18:35.326
And who knows?

18:35.362 --> 18:38.630
Someday we might go back to my castle.

18:38.665 --> 18:40.265
And you might be king.

18:40.290 --> 18:41.189
[Chuckles]

18:41.214 --> 18:44.048
I kind of think I need to
finish high school first.

18:44.371 --> 18:45.436
[Chuckles]

18:45.472 --> 18:48.306
Well, of course you do.

18:48.341 --> 18:51.809
But acting royal isn't
about castles, Henry.

18:51.845 --> 18:54.545
It's about the way you carry yourself.

18:54.581 --> 18:59.784
It's about a strength of
character and conviction.

19:00.589 --> 19:02.654
People notice these things.

19:04.771 --> 19:06.124
<i>Girls</i> notice them.

19:06.159 --> 19:07.325
[Chuckles]

19:07.360 --> 19:11.429
Now go out there and act
like the prince you are.

19:11.464 --> 19:13.164
[Sighs]

19:13.652 --> 19:15.533
Thanks, Mom.

19:17.090 --> 19:19.857
And stop slouching, Henry.

19:19.882 --> 19:22.250
Posture is self-respect.

19:37.157 --> 19:38.389
[Footsteps approaching]

19:42.356 --> 19:43.581
Hey, Violet.

19:45.982 --> 19:48.366
This is beautiful.

19:49.908 --> 19:50.907
Thank you.

19:52.702 --> 19:55.790
So, this homecoming dance...

19:55.815 --> 19:57.448
it's... it's like a ball?

19:57.544 --> 19:58.509
Yes.

19:58.923 --> 20:00.545
But that doesn't matter anymore.

20:01.798 --> 20:03.014
Don't look away.

20:03.049 --> 20:05.216
There's something much more
important happening right now,

20:05.251 --> 20:08.152
so whatever I say, just
keep your eyes right on me

20:08.188 --> 20:09.554
and smile, okay?

20:11.148 --> 20:12.190
Okay.

20:12.685 --> 20:15.059
The woman behind me...
that's not my mom.

20:16.334 --> 20:17.375
That's the queen...

20:17.731 --> 20:19.130
the evil one.

20:22.335 --> 20:23.835
What happened to your mom?

20:23.870 --> 20:25.503
That's what I got to find out,

20:25.538 --> 20:27.038
but she's watching us,

20:27.073 --> 20:30.241
so you got to come up with
a reason for us to leave.

20:30.276 --> 20:31.275
Can you do that?

20:31.685 --> 20:32.751
[Clears throat]

20:34.674 --> 20:36.314
Do you like this dress?

20:36.791 --> 20:38.716
I think it's kind of plain.

20:38.752 --> 20:41.449
Can I show you the one I really wanted?

20:41.474 --> 20:44.108
It's right in the dress-shop window.

20:44.617 --> 20:48.159
Come on. Please?

20:48.194 --> 20:49.193
Back in a sec.

20:50.818 --> 20:52.371
You're a natural liar.

20:52.396 --> 20:53.566
Why, thank you.

20:53.591 --> 20:55.514
Let's go find my moms.

he's his most vulnerable.

21:06.943 --> 21:08.775
Regina: You don't think
I know how bad this is?

21:08.800 --> 21:11.432
I fought the worst parts of
myself for years, and I failed.

21:11.457 --> 21:14.258
- Henry doesn't even stand a chance.
- Shh.

21:14.739 --> 21:15.950
I think someone else is here.

21:15.985 --> 21:17.985
There is no one here, okay?

21:18.020 --> 21:19.720
It's just you and me.

21:19.756 --> 21:20.755
The Dragon: Well...

21:22.079 --> 21:24.532
that is not true exactly.

21:24.560 --> 21:25.857
Dragon?

21:25.882 --> 21:27.281
How the hell did you get in here?

21:27.397 --> 21:29.630
The Evil Queen paid a visit to my shop

21:29.665 --> 21:32.032
after you left her for dead.

21:32.068 --> 21:35.903
When I refused to assist
her, she banished me here.

21:35.938 --> 21:38.305
Well, I guess that makes us a club.

21:38.341 --> 21:39.407
Back in New York...

21:39.770 --> 21:42.476
the battle I spoke of
deep within your soul

21:42.512 --> 21:44.678
was supposed to remain there.

21:44.714 --> 21:46.517
But you let it out.

21:46.542 --> 21:47.974
I didn't take a one-way trip

21:47.999 --> 21:50.261
for you to pick me apart, thank you.

21:50.286 --> 21:51.685
Perhaps not.

21:51.721 --> 21:55.389
Everything is about balance...
the dark and the light.

21:55.425 --> 21:58.926
This is a lesson sometimes
learned at great cost.

21:58.961 --> 22:00.528
Yeah.

22:00.563 --> 22:02.797
Well, we're about to lose our son.

22:02.832 --> 22:05.099
I sympathize.

22:05.134 --> 22:07.768
A long time ago, I lost a daughter,

22:07.804 --> 22:10.475
and I paid a price for my ignorance.

22:10.500 --> 22:12.333
I'm so sorry.

22:12.460 --> 22:13.626
So you understand.

22:13.651 --> 22:15.685
We have to get back to our son.

22:15.778 --> 22:19.947
Please, please tell us you've
found a way out of this prism.

22:20.531 --> 22:21.826
Indeed, I have.

22:21.851 --> 22:24.785
I found what you call a back door.

Thanks, monkey.

23:48.638 --> 23:51.805
Nice nest. My house barely has a couch.

23:51.841 --> 23:53.641
Sidney did this.

23:53.676 --> 23:55.444
Your magic mirror.

23:55.718 --> 23:57.778
This must have been his home.

24:02.184 --> 24:05.419
You know, I was looking for you...

24:05.454 --> 24:06.554
before we got trapped here.

24:06.589 --> 24:08.625
- My parents, they're...
- I know.

24:08.650 --> 24:12.619
Unfortunately, I cannot help
them break that terrible curse.

24:12.728 --> 24:16.697
I'm afraid that it's
beyond even my abilities.

24:16.732 --> 24:18.332
- Oh.
- Oh.

24:18.367 --> 24:20.935
But that does not
mean I cannot help you.

24:20.970 --> 24:23.938
Now, this Sidney you talked of, uh...

24:23.979 --> 24:27.747
he was working on a way out.

24:27.777 --> 24:29.944
- Another mirror?
- Oh, more than that.

24:29.979 --> 24:32.746
If we can put it back together again...

24:32.782 --> 24:34.307
A portal out.

24:34.332 --> 24:36.327
I've been trying since I arrived.

24:36.352 --> 24:38.886
A Sisyphean task.

24:40.000 --> 24:43.757
But, together, hopefully it is possible.

25:16.503 --> 25:17.648
Moms?

25:19.328 --> 25:21.795
I hope you aren't in there,

25:21.831 --> 25:24.565
but I saw something in
the mirror at Granny's,

25:24.600 --> 25:27.768
and if the Evil Queen's out here,

25:27.803 --> 25:30.904
then I'm worried the
tables have been turned.

25:30.940 --> 25:36.143
So if you're in there,
please say something.

25:36.178 --> 25:37.611
[Footsteps approaching]

25:37.647 --> 25:42.116
Evil Queen: It's not like
leaving a voicemail, Henry.

25:42.151 --> 25:45.686
Mirrors are much more
complicated than that.

25:47.223 --> 25:49.757
You trapped them in there. Didn't you?

25:49.792 --> 25:50.791
[Sighs]

25:50.816 --> 25:52.882
I thought I taught you...

25:52.907 --> 25:55.641
a gentleman never ditches his date.

25:55.964 --> 25:57.397
I didn't ditch Violet.

25:57.423 --> 25:58.783
She's somewhere safe.

25:58.868 --> 26:01.468
Because I knew my "mom" wasn't my mom.

26:01.504 --> 26:03.070
See, that's where you're wrong.

26:04.885 --> 26:06.597
Do you remember the second grade

26:06.622 --> 26:09.890
when you were afraid of
the monsters under your bed,

26:10.012 --> 26:11.812
or the dark...

26:11.847 --> 26:14.848
or that old creaking oak tree?

26:16.109 --> 26:18.986
Who made you face your fears?

26:19.021 --> 26:22.489
Who didn't tolerate your crying

26:22.525 --> 26:24.058
and toughened you up?

26:24.093 --> 26:26.060
What does that have to do with anything?

26:26.095 --> 26:27.928
That was <i> me...</i>

26:27.963 --> 26:29.129
the one with a spine.

26:29.165 --> 26:31.765
Not that weak-tea version.

26:31.801 --> 26:35.269
All I want is for you to be great.

26:35.304 --> 26:36.603
You can be king.

26:36.639 --> 26:39.540
You can have everything you want,

26:39.730 --> 26:41.763
but not if you're
always hiding behind Emma

26:41.788 --> 26:43.477
and my lesser half...

26:43.512 --> 26:45.179
always dealing with their problems,

26:45.214 --> 26:47.548
but never given any real decisions.

26:47.583 --> 26:50.918
Nice try, but you can't Darth Vader me.

26:51.460 --> 26:53.193
I'll never join you.

26:54.342 --> 26:56.323
Oh, Henry.

26:59.628 --> 27:02.262
We watched those movies
enough to know that Darth Vader

27:02.298 --> 27:03.731
wasn't so black and white.

27:03.766 --> 27:05.083
Now, was he?

27:07.075 --> 27:10.356
And I'm not really evil...

27:10.381 --> 27:12.681
despite the name.

27:12.908 --> 27:15.375
Now, I may not be a hero either.

27:15.411 --> 27:17.444
But I am a leader.

27:17.480 --> 27:18.888
[Heart beating]

27:18.913 --> 27:23.926
And leaders do what's necessary.

27:31.300 --> 27:34.268
Enjoying your little puzzle?

27:34.530 --> 27:36.196
Oh, don't worry.

27:36.232 --> 27:39.299
Henry is safe with me.

27:39.335 --> 27:44.138
In fact, he is better off.

27:44.173 --> 27:45.472
It's you.

27:45.508 --> 27:46.607
The queen.

27:46.642 --> 27:47.741
Ding.

27:48.760 --> 27:51.812
I may have put his body in the mirror.

27:52.655 --> 27:55.449
But I kept his heart.

27:57.553 --> 27:59.353
Henry?

27:59.777 --> 28:02.684
- Mom. Mom!
- It's all right.

28:02.709 --> 28:03.924
It's gonna be okay!

28:03.959 --> 28:05.259
We're coming to get you, Henry.

28:05.294 --> 28:07.594
Are you sure about that?

28:08.697 --> 28:09.985
Henry: Mom!

28:10.923 --> 28:12.266
[Whoosh]

28:12.301 --> 28:13.600
[Groans]

28:16.155 --> 28:17.838
What's wrong? Did she hurt you?

28:17.863 --> 28:19.315
No, don't come any closer.

28:19.456 --> 28:20.452
I'm sorry.

28:20.477 --> 28:22.419
I...

28:22.444 --> 28:24.344
I don't want to do this.

28:29.785 --> 28:32.886
[Growls]

28:37.860 --> 28:38.826
Seriously?

28:39.149 --> 28:41.316
[Roars]

28:44.259 --> 28:44.925
Kill them.

28:44.960 --> 28:46.727
[Roars]

28:52.067 --> 28:53.734
[Shrieks]

28:56.804 --> 28:58.570
[Growls]

29:04.366 --> 29:05.612
Stop.

29:05.647 --> 29:07.580
Why are you doing this?

29:07.616 --> 29:11.718
Because unlike them, Henry,
I'm giving you a choice.

29:11.753 --> 29:13.320
You may not have magic...

29:13.940 --> 29:15.388
but this does,

29:15.767 --> 29:17.900
and you can save them with it...

29:20.028 --> 29:21.561
[Dragon growls]

29:21.596 --> 29:24.164
by smashing The Dragon's heart.

29:25.876 --> 29:28.329
But...

29:28.354 --> 29:30.521
but The Dragon's an innocent.

29:31.333 --> 29:34.774
Darkening my heart...
It won't make me yours.

29:36.945 --> 29:40.747
But you'll be that much closer
to understanding who <i> I</i> am.

29:40.782 --> 29:42.482
[Dragon growling]

29:42.517 --> 29:46.486
Your mothers need you, Henry.

29:46.521 --> 29:49.723
But if Regina dies, so do you.

29:49.758 --> 29:51.691
You're connected.

29:51.727 --> 29:55.695
That's how certain I am
you'll make the right choice.

29:55.731 --> 29:56.863
[Growls]

29:56.898 --> 29:58.231
- [Gasps]
- Emma: The mirror.

29:58.266 --> 29:59.399
That was our ticket out of here.

29:59.434 --> 30:00.467
Any ideas?

30:00.502 --> 30:03.670
We don't have magic,
but The Dragon does.

30:04.505 --> 30:06.473
If we can aim his fire at the mirror...

30:06.508 --> 30:07.640
Can we blast our way out of here?

30:07.822 --> 30:09.181
It's worth a shot.

30:11.380 --> 30:12.879
[Roars]

30:12.914 --> 30:14.347
One of us should stay
here, just in case.

30:14.383 --> 30:15.949
Right. In case the other one gets fried.

30:16.156 --> 30:18.023
- I'll go.
- No. I've got this.

30:18.048 --> 30:19.052
Why do you keep trying
to martyr yourself?

30:19.087 --> 30:20.286
<i>I'm</i> the one
with a death sentence.

30:20.322 --> 30:21.554
Emma, just listen.

30:21.590 --> 30:23.523
[Dragon roars]

30:24.938 --> 30:26.559
Emma: Hear it?

30:27.125 --> 30:28.995
I'm afraid to raise Henry alone.

30:29.030 --> 30:31.497
What? You've done great.

30:31.522 --> 30:33.266
But every time I see him with
Mommie Dearest over there,

30:33.301 --> 30:34.768
it's just a reminder

30:34.803 --> 30:36.269
of the horrible mother
I could have been.

30:36.304 --> 30:38.138
Well, you're not, 'cause I'm here, too.

30:38.173 --> 30:39.472
We always do what's right for Henry,

30:39.508 --> 30:42.442
so you're not sacrificing
yourself, and neither am I.

30:43.935 --> 30:45.445
So we do this together?

30:45.480 --> 30:46.713
Damn right.

30:46.849 --> 30:48.106
Three, two...

30:50.385 --> 30:52.652
Hey!

30:52.687 --> 30:55.054
Over here!

30:58.460 --> 30:59.592
Aah!

31:00.295 --> 31:01.361
Ooh.

31:01.396 --> 31:02.829
Tick, tock, Henry.

31:03.012 --> 31:04.045
Tick...

31:04.641 --> 31:06.599
tock.

31:06.801 --> 31:09.435
If you are my mom,

31:09.864 --> 31:12.428
please, don't make me do this.

31:14.509 --> 31:17.243
Well, as my own mother proved,

31:17.279 --> 31:20.046
sometimes all you need is a little push.

31:28.564 --> 31:30.055
- Henry!
- Henry!

31:30.080 --> 31:31.324
- Henry!
- Henry!

31:31.393 --> 31:33.293
Do it, Henry.

31:33.328 --> 31:36.095
- Henry!
- Do it now! Do it!

31:36.131 --> 31:37.530
Henry!

31:38.767 --> 31:40.133
[Roars]

31:40.178 --> 31:41.408
- Henry!
- Henry!

31:41.433 --> 31:42.899
- Emma: Henry!
- Help me, Henry! Please!

31:42.924 --> 31:44.858
- Henry!
- Help us! Please, Henry, help us!

31:48.303 --> 31:51.171
[Dragon roars]

32:09.109 --> 32:10.730
Henry?

32:14.402 --> 32:16.102
You!

32:16.137 --> 32:18.438
You made him soft!

32:18.473 --> 32:20.540
You stay away from our son.

32:21.301 --> 32:22.135
[Sighs]

32:22.160 --> 32:24.844
Hiding behind your moms again, I see.

32:24.880 --> 32:27.280
I'm not hiding.

32:27.315 --> 32:29.449
You may not see it, but I'm strong,

32:29.755 --> 32:32.218
because my moms taught me
that family makes you stronger

32:32.254 --> 32:34.554
than you'll ever be by yourself.

32:34.589 --> 32:36.789
And that's something you'll never have,

32:37.340 --> 32:39.540
because you'll always be alone.

32:42.089 --> 32:44.482
I wanted to give you a choice.

32:46.568 --> 32:49.369
But it appears you weren't ready yet.

32:50.215 --> 32:52.582
- [Gasps]
- I suggest...

32:52.607 --> 32:56.476
unless you like the feeling
of hook piercing flesh,

32:56.511 --> 32:59.212
you shove off, Your Majesty.

33:01.149 --> 33:03.383
I'm your mother, Henry.

33:04.480 --> 33:07.520
And I only want what's best for you.

33:19.746 --> 33:22.354
Ah, the break-in was nothing.

33:22.379 --> 33:24.212
I'm proud of you, Aladdin.

33:24.873 --> 33:26.039
Really?

33:26.181 --> 33:27.249
"Hero" looks good on you.

33:27.284 --> 33:29.184
[Chuckles]

33:29.592 --> 33:30.731
I don't know about "hero."

33:30.756 --> 33:32.564
I'm just a guy helping out a friend.

33:32.589 --> 33:34.089
A friend in need.

33:34.124 --> 33:37.025
That's what heroes do... help people.

33:37.579 --> 33:40.228
And I haven't been
so great at it lately.

33:40.502 --> 33:42.735
I was so focused on saving Agrabah,

33:42.760 --> 33:45.160
I nearly stopped you from helping Belle.

33:45.195 --> 33:46.828
So you care about your kingdom.

33:46.864 --> 33:48.063
That's not a crime.

33:49.184 --> 33:52.768
But stealing this definitely was.

33:52.803 --> 33:54.803
[Chuckles] What is this?

33:54.838 --> 33:56.062
Ah, just a little something extra

33:56.087 --> 33:57.497
I snagged from Gold's shop.

33:57.641 --> 33:58.907
Thought it might help a girl I know.

33:59.609 --> 34:01.276
Well, who's inside?

34:01.312 --> 34:03.111
[Gasps] Is it? Is he?

34:03.147 --> 34:05.099
Uh, no. Afraid not.

34:05.124 --> 34:07.124
My old pal has moved on.

34:07.884 --> 34:09.246
- The Genie...
- Mm.

34:09.954 --> 34:11.987
is gone.

34:12.022 --> 34:13.455
It's okay.

34:13.489 --> 34:14.755
He's free now.

34:15.074 --> 34:17.859
But maybe whoever's inside here...

34:17.895 --> 34:20.295
maybe they can help us find Agrabah.

34:27.237 --> 34:29.288
Okay.

34:29.404 --> 34:31.938
- Hello, pretty.
- [Clears throat]

34:33.911 --> 34:35.911
Can we, uh... can we hurry a bit?

34:35.946 --> 34:37.813
I really want to be safe
in the Enchanted Forest

34:37.848 --> 34:39.514
before Rumple discovers it's gone.

34:39.550 --> 34:40.190
[Whoosh]

34:40.216 --> 34:41.148
Too late.

34:41.714 --> 34:43.596
Rumple!

34:44.429 --> 34:45.853
I knew that street rat

34:45.889 --> 34:48.857
wasn't digging around
my shop for himself.

34:48.891 --> 34:53.495
And I cannot let you take
our child away from me.

34:55.995 --> 34:59.735
So now, no matter where you go,

34:59.770 --> 35:01.303
I'll find you.

35:02.301 --> 35:04.206
You really are a beast.

35:04.241 --> 35:08.076
Call me what you will,
but it comes from love...

35:08.112 --> 35:10.345
my love for our child and you.

35:11.680 --> 35:13.747
You... you call this love?

35:14.676 --> 35:16.451
You're scared, Rumple.

35:16.793 --> 35:19.187
I-I almost won today.

35:19.223 --> 35:23.525
And next time, I will
run so fast and so far

35:23.560 --> 35:27.496
that you will never even
set eyes on this child.

35:28.592 --> 35:31.767
Let me remind you, dearie,

35:31.802 --> 35:34.770
that Rumplestiltskin
<i>takes</i> children,

35:34.805 --> 35:35.898
not the other way 'round.

35:35.923 --> 35:37.723
Tell that to your firstborn.

35:37.841 --> 35:40.642
- You do not get to speak.
- [Gagging]

35:42.666 --> 35:45.701
- Wh... What's happening?
- Oh! Oh!

35:45.726 --> 35:46.495
What...

35:46.520 --> 35:48.554
That is called a heart attack.

35:48.652 --> 35:50.359
- [Gasps]
- [Chuckles]

35:50.384 --> 35:52.106
I think he forgot that his little ticker

35:52.131 --> 35:54.631
only tocks thanks to me.

35:54.792 --> 35:57.225
See, when I saved your life
back in that New York hospital,

35:57.261 --> 36:00.062
I didn't do it out of
the kindness of my heart.

36:00.097 --> 36:02.531
We had a deal, remember?

36:02.889 --> 36:05.000
So whenever you hurt me...

36:05.035 --> 36:06.535
[Chuckles]

36:06.570 --> 36:08.003
you're only hurting yourself.

36:08.038 --> 36:10.706
[Chuckles]

36:10.741 --> 36:14.609
There's one more thing
Rumplestiltskin's quite good at,

36:14.645 --> 36:17.512
and that's finding loopholes.

36:17.548 --> 36:19.981
We are far from done, dearie.

38:21.138 --> 38:23.338
You just seemed a little distant lately.

38:23.373 --> 38:24.873
Oh.

38:25.119 --> 38:27.342
I'm... I'm sorry. It's not you.

38:27.377 --> 38:29.010
[Breathes deeply]

38:29.046 --> 38:32.427
I'm just having a bit of a
hard time adjusting to school.

38:32.452 --> 38:34.385
[Scoffs] School?

38:34.685 --> 38:35.857
<i>That's</i> what's going on?

38:36.114 --> 38:39.321
Yeah. [Chuckles]

38:39.356 --> 38:41.723
It's like those movies you showed me.

38:41.758 --> 38:45.727
I just feel so out of place.

38:45.762 --> 38:47.342
Like, who am I?

38:47.367 --> 38:53.101
Am I a jock or a princess or a nerd?

38:53.126 --> 38:54.401
- I...
- I knew I should have started

38:54.426 --> 38:56.426
with "Sixteen Candles."

38:58.451 --> 39:00.175
You don't need a label.

39:00.210 --> 39:01.910
You're Violet.

39:03.810 --> 39:05.080
You want to dance?

39:20.297 --> 39:23.398
♪ 'Cause I saw you in
my dreams that night ♪

39:23.433 --> 39:26.134
♪ And I knew that you were right ♪

39:26.169 --> 39:29.304
♪ So I called you in the morning ♪

39:29.339 --> 39:31.606
He's gonna be okay, isn't he?

39:31.642 --> 39:33.391
You mean?

39:33.416 --> 39:37.651
With or without me, he's gonna be okay.

39:37.915 --> 39:40.448
The queen was wrong about him.

39:40.853 --> 39:43.118
I was so worried about how
I was going to raise him,

39:43.153 --> 39:46.506
I didn't even notice...

39:47.366 --> 39:49.266
We already had.

39:49.426 --> 39:52.327
♪ If I see you in
my dreams tonight ♪

39:56.633 --> 39:58.433
[Door bells jingle]

40:01.271 --> 40:04.105
The things we do for our children.

40:04.141 --> 40:05.340
Yes, I heard Henry

40:05.375 --> 40:08.436
didn't exactly make
his mother proud today.

40:08.461 --> 40:10.326
All children rebel.

40:10.576 --> 40:12.714
That's their job.

40:12.749 --> 40:16.451
And ours is to do
what's best for them...

40:16.486 --> 40:18.887
to make them strong.

40:19.345 --> 40:22.251
Henry will realize that someday.

40:24.650 --> 40:27.145
How far are you willing to go

40:28.325 --> 40:32.477
to get this, uh, new beginning of yours?

40:32.502 --> 40:33.902
[Chuckles]

40:33.937 --> 40:37.605
Oh, you know me. I'll do anything.

40:38.031 --> 40:43.111
Then perhaps we can both
get that, uh, happy ending.

40:49.601 --> 40:52.988
So, we <i> are</i> on the same team.

40:56.201 --> 40:57.701
For now.

40:58.729 --> 41:00.929
You know how teams work, don't you?

41:00.964 --> 41:04.232
You need a little
give and a little take.

41:04.672 --> 41:07.702
Oh, that sounds like a proposition.

41:08.989 --> 41:11.873
You know, there is one more
thing we have to take care of.

41:11.908 --> 41:13.441
Hmm?

41:13.477 --> 41:14.738
Zelena.

41:16.360 --> 41:19.028
She's become a bit of a problem.

41:20.411 --> 41:24.300
And you want me to give
her a stern talking-to?

41:24.325 --> 41:25.441
No.

41:27.457 --> 41:29.095
I want you to kill her.
