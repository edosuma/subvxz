What were you doing hitting
the back of a cop car?

16:01.290 --> 16:03.500
Uh uh uh, you first.
I'm the mama.

16:03.500 --> 16:05.120
Fine.

16:05.120 --> 16:07.420
Tess' uncle was patrolling
the neighborhood for the tagger,

16:07.420 --> 16:09.380
and she wanted me
to go along with them.

16:09.380 --> 16:10.790
She goes all the time.

16:10.790 --> 16:12.540
I think she might wanna be
a police officer one day.

16:13.540 --> 16:15.290
-Wow.
-How about that?

16:15.290 --> 16:17.670
Why? What did you
think I was doing?

16:17.670 --> 16:19.420
Mom thought Tess
was the tagger,

16:19.420 --> 16:21.000
and that she was gonna
drag you along with her.

16:21.000 --> 16:22.040
-Booker!
-Mom!

16:22.040 --> 16:23.420
What? It's only because

16:23.420 --> 16:25.380
Booker overheard
a suspicious conversation

16:25.380 --> 16:26.500
when he was
spying on you two.

16:26.500 --> 16:27.830
-Booker!
-Mom!

16:27.830 --> 16:29.500
-Booker!
-Oh...

16:29.500 --> 16:30.960
You spied on us?

16:30.960 --> 16:32.960
(sigh)
To be fair,

16:32.960 --> 16:34.210
it was because
I had a vision

16:34.210 --> 16:35.830
that you and Tess were in
the back of the cop car.

16:35.830 --> 16:37.380
And I had
a vision, too!

16:37.380 --> 16:39.380
Of what I thought was
you and Tess in jail.

16:40.380 --> 16:42.420
Turns out,
it was us in jail.

16:42.420 --> 16:44.460
-(laughs) It's kinda funny, huh?
-It is funny.

16:44.460 --> 16:46.500
(laughing, unintelligible)

16:46.500 --> 16:48.620
(laughing)

16:48.620 --> 16:50.420
(whispers)
She doesn't
think it's funny.

16:50.420 --> 16:53.460
Well, I hope you two,
and your visions are happy.

16:53.460 --> 16:56.330
Obviously, Tess isn't
the tagger, okay?

16:56.330 --> 16:57.710
So, you can
cut her a break.

16:57.710 --> 16:59.250
-Sorry, baby.
-Sorry, Nia.

17:01.120 --> 17:03.250
If Tess isn't the tagger,

17:03.250 --> 17:04.330
then who is?

17:04.330 --> 17:08.290
♪ ♪

17:10.670 --> 17:13.080
(laughs)
Couldn't sneak into
the laundry room, huh?

17:13.080 --> 17:14.540
We made do!

17:14.540 --> 17:17.380
-We had to use the dishwasher.
-Yeah.

17:17.380 --> 17:18.330
(door knocking)

17:21.080 --> 17:23.420
Ha! Five weeks of this, huh?

17:23.420 --> 17:25.420
(Raven laughs sarcastically)

17:25.420 --> 17:26.960
What you want,
tiny dancer?

17:27.960 --> 17:30.210
I have found some
incriminating evidence,

17:30.210 --> 17:33.120
that just may prove
who the tagger is.

17:33.120 --> 17:35.290
And it's someone
in this room!

17:35.290 --> 17:38.120
Dun dun dun!

17:38.120 --> 17:40.920
Are you done, done, done?

17:41.960 --> 17:43.500
Sorry, that
just felt right.

17:44.460 --> 17:45.580
Now,

17:45.580 --> 17:47.670
let's see who's
the tagger.

17:48.670 --> 17:50.000
Was it...

17:51.120 --> 17:53.000
-Booker!?
-(all gasp)

17:53.000 --> 17:55.380
You wanted a new
hot water heater,

17:55.380 --> 17:57.580
so your BUTT
wouldn't freeze

17:57.580 --> 17:59.290
during your showers.

18:00.290 --> 18:01.830
You're accusing me?

18:02.830 --> 18:04.500
I fed you donuts!

18:06.460 --> 18:08.460
Or,

18:08.460 --> 18:09.880
was it...

18:09.880 --> 18:12.170
-Levi!?
-(all gasp)

18:12.170 --> 18:14.540
-Mommy!
-Oh, honey!

18:14.540 --> 18:17.210
He complained
the building's slow Wi-Fi

18:17.210 --> 18:19.000
was a pain in the BUTT!

18:20.500 --> 18:22.580
Or was it...

18:22.580 --> 18:24.420
-Nia!?
-(all gasp)

18:24.420 --> 18:27.580
With her quest
for recycling bins,

18:27.580 --> 18:30.040
she wasn't taking
any ifs, ands,

18:30.040 --> 18:32.540
or BUTTS for an answer.

18:34.880 --> 18:36.540
Or was it...

18:37.880 --> 18:39.540
-you!?
-(Raven gasps)

18:40.580 --> 18:42.170
I, I don't even get a gasp?

18:42.170 --> 18:43.080
(gasp)

18:43.080 --> 18:44.210
Thank you, Chels.

18:44.210 --> 18:45.500
Oh, no.
I just realized,

18:45.500 --> 18:47.420
I forgot to put fabric softener
in the dishwasher.

18:48.580 --> 18:50.420
So, you're all suspects,

18:50.420 --> 18:52.040
but only one of
you are guilty.

18:52.040 --> 18:53.420
Will you get to the point?

18:53.420 --> 18:55.620
I like drama.

18:55.620 --> 18:57.500
I give you exhibit A!

18:59.960 --> 19:02.420
Mitch:
After I busted
Big Red and Little Red,

19:02.420 --> 19:04.540
I noticed they
dropped a sweater

19:04.540 --> 19:06.460
with spray paint on it!

19:06.460 --> 19:07.460
And then,

19:07.460 --> 19:10.670
I smiled sinisterly.

19:10.670 --> 19:13.290
And when I compared the color
of the paint on the sweater,

19:13.290 --> 19:14.920
to the color of the graffiti,

19:14.920 --> 19:17.040
perfect match.

19:17.040 --> 19:18.290
And again,

19:18.290 --> 19:20.420
I smiled sinisterly.

19:21.420 --> 19:23.460
So, who would wear
what appears to be

19:23.460 --> 19:25.670
a 12-year-old
girl's sweater?

19:25.670 --> 19:27.620
I think it's
pretty obvious.

19:27.620 --> 19:29.000
Could only be...

19:30.000 --> 19:31.580
-you!
-Me!?

19:31.580 --> 19:33.210
Just kidding.

19:33.210 --> 19:34.500
It was Nia!

19:34.500 --> 19:35.580
All:
Nia?

19:36.880 --> 19:38.170
Baby girl, is that true?

19:39.620 --> 19:40.580
No!

19:41.750 --> 19:42.790
It isn't.

19:43.920 --> 19:45.620
-'Cause I did it.
-(all gasp)

19:45.620 --> 19:47.000
(laughs)

19:47.000 --> 19:48.120
I knew it! (laughs)

19:48.120 --> 19:49.960
Wait a minute. That doesn't
explain the sweater.

19:51.380 --> 19:54.080
I borrowed that sweater from
Nia when I tagged the building.

19:54.080 --> 19:55.250
(laughs)

19:55.250 --> 19:56.540
I knew it!
Wait a minute,

19:56.540 --> 19:58.080
you would never wear
one of Nia's sweaters.

19:58.080 --> 19:59.790
You know what?
I'm starting to believe,

19:59.790 --> 20:02.120
I have no idea
what is going on!

20:03.500 --> 20:04.830
It's because
you don't, Mom.

20:06.080 --> 20:08.580
Tess didn't do it.
It was actually...

20:10.670 --> 20:12.500
-Me.
-(all gasp)

20:12.500 --> 20:14.500
Dun dun dun!

20:14.500 --> 20:16.960
Oh, so that's how you do it.

20:19.540 --> 20:22.750
Once I knew Mitch was never
gonna do anything on our list,

20:22.750 --> 20:24.620
I started writing,
"Bottles and Cans,"

20:24.620 --> 20:26.460
on the dumpster
for tenants to recycle in.

20:26.460 --> 20:28.580
But, I heard someone coming,

20:28.580 --> 20:29.880
I panicked, and when
I turned to leave,

20:29.880 --> 20:32.080
my elbow wiped off
the top of the "O,"

20:32.080 --> 20:33.580
making it a "U,"

20:33.580 --> 20:35.420
and leaving the word "butt."

20:37.210 --> 20:38.710
Nia, I can't
believe you did that.

20:38.710 --> 20:40.710
I apologize, Mom.

20:40.710 --> 20:42.330
Recycling
and the environment

20:42.330 --> 20:43.580
is important
to me, but...

20:44.580 --> 20:46.250
I guess I went about it
the wrong way.

20:46.250 --> 20:48.040
Yeah, you did.

20:50.420 --> 20:52.750
Thank you for trying to take
the fall for me, but...

20:53.960 --> 20:55.210
why would you do that?

20:55.210 --> 20:56.670
'Cause I didn't
wanna see

20:56.670 --> 20:58.330
my best friend
get in trouble.

20:58.330 --> 20:59.540
And besides,

20:59.540 --> 21:00.580
your mom always
thinks it's me

21:00.580 --> 21:01.670
doing bad stuff anyway.

21:02.830 --> 21:04.670
So, I may as well
go with it.

21:04.670 --> 21:06.330
Thank you.

21:10.170 --> 21:11.460
(clears throat)

21:11.460 --> 21:12.580
-Mom?
-Yeah?

21:13.580 --> 21:14.670
Mom, do you, uh,

21:14.670 --> 21:16.710
have something you
wanna say to Tess?

21:18.040 --> 21:19.000
Do I have to?

21:19.000 --> 21:20.080
Both:
Yes!

21:21.500 --> 21:22.880
Hey, Tess.

21:22.880 --> 21:23.880
I, um...

21:25.670 --> 21:27.620
I like the way you wear
your hat to the side.

21:27.620 --> 21:29.920
(clears throat) And?

21:34.670 --> 21:36.210
I was wrong about you, Tess.

21:37.210 --> 21:38.580
You're a good friend to Nia.

21:38.580 --> 21:40.670
And Nia, I should
have trusted

21:40.670 --> 21:42.210
your judgment
in friends.

21:43.620 --> 21:44.920
She okay.

21:44.920 --> 21:46.620
Thanks, Ms. B.

21:46.620 --> 21:47.710
Look,

21:47.710 --> 21:49.670
I know I'm around
here a lot,

21:49.670 --> 21:51.750
and I kinda get on
your nerves sometimes,

21:51.750 --> 21:53.620
but I just really
like it here.

21:54.710 --> 21:55.960
It's kinda like home.

21:58.710 --> 22:00.420
Aw.

22:00.420 --> 22:02.080
Oh,

22:02.080 --> 22:04.210
that was so touching.

22:04.210 --> 22:05.710
Made me cry. (sniff)

22:05.710 --> 22:07.540
Now, gimme that
list of complaints.

22:08.540 --> 22:09.920
Thank you, Mitch!

22:09.920 --> 22:11.330
No, thank you.

22:12.330 --> 22:14.620
(loudly blows nose)

22:16.250 --> 22:18.250
Ah, that's better!

22:18.250 --> 22:19.960
Wait a minute, now!
Come here!

22:19.960 --> 22:21.670
Now, I called
the city, alright?

22:21.670 --> 22:24.710
And this building is required
to have recycling bins,

22:24.710 --> 22:27.120
hot water, Wi-Fi that works,

22:27.120 --> 22:28.880
and laundry room access.

22:28.880 --> 22:31.380
So until then,
you can forget about
cashing my rent check,

22:31.380 --> 22:34.040
which you probably not gonna get
for, like, another three weeks,
but still!

22:34.040 --> 22:36.670
