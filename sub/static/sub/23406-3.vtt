00:07.000 --> 00:09.103
- As you all know,
profits for Hampton DeVille

00:09.206 --> 00:10.448
are at an all-time high.

00:10.551 --> 00:13.344
Unfortunately,
the well-being of our employees

00:13.448 --> 00:15.379
is at an all-time low.

00:15.482 --> 00:19.517
Let's take a look at the average
Hampton DeVille employee.

00:19.620 --> 00:22.068
The average life expectancy
for a Hampton DeVille employee

00:22.172 --> 00:24.793
is 57.1 years.

00:24.896 --> 00:26.620
They get 5.2 hours--
- I'm so tired.

00:26.724 --> 00:28.344
I wish I could be asleep
all the time.

00:28.448 --> 00:30.068
- You just described death.

00:30.172 --> 00:32.172
- Hmm. Yeah, I guess
I want to be dead.

00:32.275 --> 00:33.310
- I can't wait to die.

00:33.413 --> 00:34.655
It sounds so relaxing.

00:34.758 --> 00:36.827
- The average employee
is half man, half woman.

00:36.931 --> 00:39.068
They have one testicle,

00:39.172 --> 00:41.862
one breast, and half a vagina.

00:41.965 --> 00:44.793
Every year,
the average employee consumes

00:44.896 --> 00:47.137
561 cups of coffee...

00:47.241 --> 00:48.896
- I feel nothing
when I drink coffee.

00:49.000 --> 00:49.931
- Coffee is a scam.

00:50.034 --> 00:51.241
Be an adult.
Take an Adderall.

00:51.344 --> 00:52.793
- The average
Hampton DeVille employee

00:52.896 --> 00:55.344
strongly agrees
with the following phrase.

00:55.448 --> 00:57.793
"If I see a pill,
I eat a pill."

00:57.896 --> 01:01.482
They smoke 275 cigarettes
annually,

01:01.586 --> 01:03.206
97 marijuana cigarettes,

01:03.310 --> 01:05.137
and due to some
statistical outliers,

01:05.241 --> 01:08.344
the average employee
does heroin.

01:08.448 --> 01:10.344
I would never do heroin.

01:10.448 --> 01:12.068
Unless I was dying,

01:12.172 --> 01:13.413
or someone just
offered it to me.

01:13.517 --> 01:15.586
- I don't have a 401,
so as of now,

01:15.689 --> 01:17.586
my retirement plan
is to overdose on drugs.

01:17.689 --> 01:18.793
- Smart.

01:18.896 --> 01:19.724
- The average employee

01:19.827 --> 01:23.068
has 7.8 suicidal thoughts
per day,

01:23.172 --> 01:25.551
18 panic attacks a year,

01:25.655 --> 01:28.517
and wonders once an hour,
every hour,

01:28.620 --> 01:30.620
why this is happening to them.

01:30.724 --> 01:32.620
And that concludes
my presentation

01:32.724 --> 01:34.379
on how Hampton DeVille employees

01:34.482 --> 01:36.793
cope with the pain
of being alive.

01:39.172 --> 01:42.103
- Okay.
Thank you, Grace.

01:42.206 --> 01:43.482
Should we talk next steps?

01:43.586 --> 01:45.793
- First step: let us never
speak of this again.

01:45.896 --> 01:47.206
- Yes, that's right.

01:47.310 --> 01:48.172
That's really the only step.

02:32.517 --> 02:34.103
- You've heard of
enhanced interrogation, right?

02:34.206 --> 02:35.379
- Yeah.
- Well, it's like that,

02:35.482 --> 02:37.448
but with acupuncture.
- Ah.

02:37.551 --> 02:40.206
I know a masseuse
who does this amazing thing

02:40.310 --> 02:42.448
where she wraps her hands
around your neck

02:42.551 --> 02:45.482
and just oh-so-subtly
suffocates you.

02:45.586 --> 02:47.620
- Is that Matt?
- Oh, no.

02:47.724 --> 02:49.758
Finding a dead body
is one of my top 25 fears.

02:54.068 --> 02:55.103
- He has a neck pillow.

02:55.206 --> 02:56.896
- He died in his sleep.

02:58.413 --> 03:00.034
Oh!

03:00.137 --> 03:01.103
- Hi, Matt.
- Oh, my...

03:01.206 --> 03:02.448
God!
- Ah!

03:02.551 --> 03:04.068
- John.
- Ah!

03:04.172 --> 03:05.827
- What?
- What?

03:05.931 --> 03:08.551
- Matt, the fact that you
have been sleeping in your car

03:08.655 --> 03:10.379
means we have not been
challenging you enough.

03:10.482 --> 03:13.172
But that's about to change.

03:13.275 --> 03:14.724
- We need you to digitize

03:14.827 --> 03:17.413
all the employee injury
and death reports

03:17.517 --> 03:19.206
from the past 50 years.

03:19.310 --> 03:20.482
- I'm gonna be honest with you,

03:20.586 --> 03:22.103
it's an upsetting amount
of work.

03:22.206 --> 03:23.310
- It sucks.

03:23.413 --> 03:25.103
- I'm sorry, but how does
digitizing old files

03:25.206 --> 03:26.724
fit into my job description?

03:28.862 --> 03:31.413
I'm gonna lose my mind
if I don't get my nap.

03:31.517 --> 03:32.655
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

03:32.758 --> 03:34.862
- Wow, Matt.
That sounds awful.

03:34.965 --> 03:37.896
Almost as bad as having
spinal surgery!

03:38.000 --> 03:39.000
Because the chairs here

03:39.103 --> 03:41.862
don't provide lumbar support!

03:41.965 --> 03:43.482
But let's get back
to how you're a victim.

03:44.551 --> 03:46.827
- Jake, buddy!

03:46.931 --> 03:49.344
It is so good to see you
back in the office, man.

03:49.448 --> 03:50.896
The place wasn't the same
without you.

03:51.000 --> 03:52.241
I brought you these.

03:52.344 --> 03:53.655
- Wow, thanks, Baron.

03:53.758 --> 03:55.000
I kind of thought you hated me

03:55.103 --> 03:57.000
'cause you've said that
to my face many times.

03:59.586 --> 04:02.241
Uh, so anyway, um...

04:02.344 --> 04:03.586
what'd they give you
to manage the pain?

04:03.689 --> 04:05.482
Must be some serious stuff.

04:05.586 --> 04:07.413
- They gave me hydrocodone,
oxycodone,

04:07.517 --> 04:08.310
lorazepam, diazepam.

04:08.413 --> 04:10.000
- You know, I get, um,

04:10.103 --> 04:12.758
uh, retinal pain
from staring at screens all day,

04:12.862 --> 04:16.310
so if you have
any leftover pills,

04:16.413 --> 04:18.310
remember who brought you flowers

04:18.413 --> 04:21.448
when you were down and out...

04:21.551 --> 04:23.620
and in need of a friend.

04:26.344 --> 04:27.482
There's a Benji in the card.

04:30.172 --> 04:32.000
- Wow, that was pretty blatant.

04:32.103 --> 04:33.655
- I've been dealing with this
all morning.

04:33.758 --> 04:36.620
Turns out painkillers
are pretty valuable currency.

04:39.586 --> 04:41.793
- Jake, heard about your back.

04:41.896 --> 04:43.448
That sucks, man.

04:43.551 --> 04:44.793
Quick question, though.

04:44.896 --> 04:46.862
What kind of pills
are you taking?

04:46.965 --> 04:50.034
- Hey, Jake.

04:50.137 --> 04:51.655
- Hey, Jake.
- Jake.

04:51.758 --> 04:52.862
- Jake!

04:52.965 --> 04:54.241
- Jim, buddy.

04:54.344 --> 04:56.482
- I am so sorry to hear
about your back.

04:56.586 --> 04:58.896
- I can only imagine
the pain you're in.

04:59.000 --> 04:59.896
- You are a hero.

05:00.000 --> 05:00.896
- What'd they give ya?

05:01.000 --> 05:02.793
- What was it,
Norcos, Vals, Vics?

05:02.896 --> 05:04.586
- You are not supposed to take
all of 'em.

05:04.689 --> 05:05.793
- That would be dangerous.

05:05.896 --> 05:08.103
- My carpal tunnel's
been really acting up.

05:08.206 --> 05:10.413
- This weekend, I have to meet
my mom's new boyfriend.

05:10.517 --> 05:11.620
- That's not good.

05:11.724 --> 05:13.068
- He used to be my boyfriend.

05:13.172 --> 05:14.896
- I'm just really bored.

05:15.000 --> 05:15.689
- I'm a drug addict.

05:15.793 --> 05:16.965
- I would be so grateful.

05:17.068 --> 05:18.965
- If you love me,
you'll give me the pills.

05:19.068 --> 05:20.689
- I'll give you something;
you give me something.

05:20.793 --> 05:22.793
- I need the pills.
- Just give them to me.

05:22.896 --> 05:23.931
- Please.

05:24.034 --> 05:25.724
- Don't act like
you're the only one in pain!

05:25.827 --> 05:27.413
- And that would really
help me out, man.

05:27.517 --> 05:28.931
- What's in it for me?

06:01.172 --> 06:03.344
Is that a new suit?

06:03.448 --> 06:04.931
- Yeah, I got it from Hank
in accounting.

06:05.034 --> 06:06.551
His in-laws are visiting
this weekend.

06:09.310 --> 06:12.172
- Is that a Kandinsky?

06:12.275 --> 06:13.517
- Here's another batch.

06:14.827 --> 06:16.620
- Well, now I really
want to be dead.

06:21.896 --> 06:23.379
- Hi, Matt.
You look like you're dying.

06:23.482 --> 06:26.034
- Thanks, Grace.
- Jake.

06:26.137 --> 06:27.206
- Oh, hi, Grace.

06:27.310 --> 06:28.931
Let me guess, you want
to exploit our friendship

06:29.034 --> 06:29.896
for some pain pills.

06:30.000 --> 06:32.206
- What? No.

06:32.310 --> 06:33.275
I just brought you
these balloons

06:33.379 --> 06:36.482
because I care about you.

06:37.551 --> 06:39.034
- That's so sweet, Grace.

06:39.137 --> 06:40.413
You're such a good person.

06:40.517 --> 06:43.931
- Yes. I am good.

06:46.206 --> 06:47.448
Fuck, fuck, fuck.

06:54.379 --> 06:55.517
God, I need a nap.

07:00.379 --> 07:02.034
- Matt, we know you need sleep,

07:02.137 --> 07:03.724
but we're counting on you.
- You're young.

07:03.827 --> 07:05.620
You're not allowed to sleep
until you're dead.

07:29.344 --> 07:31.482
I don't think employees
are allowed to smoke in here.

07:31.586 --> 07:33.068
- What are you gonna do,
fire me?

07:33.172 --> 07:34.103
- No, it's just that...

07:34.206 --> 07:36.137
cigarettes are bad for you.

07:36.241 --> 07:37.965
- Cigarettes can't kill me.

07:38.068 --> 07:39.206
- Why not?

07:39.310 --> 07:41.517
- Because I'm a  ghost!

07:41.620 --> 07:42.827
- Hey, Matt!

07:42.931 --> 07:44.379
- Ooh.

07:44.482 --> 07:46.344
I thought you were dead,
but turns out

07:46.448 --> 07:47.965
you're just sleeping
on the toilet,

07:48.068 --> 07:49.758
which is somehow worse.

08:09.103 --> 08:11.344
- Good morning, Matt!

08:11.448 --> 08:14.896
I'm gonna show you
how I get through my day...

08:15.000 --> 08:16.137
without falling asleep
on the toilet.

08:16.241 --> 08:17.896
- John, how is waking up
at 6:00 a.m.

08:18.000 --> 08:18.965
to play basketball
gonna help me?

08:19.068 --> 08:20.517
God.
- Endorphins.

08:20.620 --> 08:21.655
Intense physical activity

08:21.758 --> 08:24.241
floods your brain
with endorphins.

08:24.344 --> 08:25.344
You don't need sleep

08:25.448 --> 08:26.827
when you can trick your body
into thinking

08:26.931 --> 08:28.862
that you're constantly

08:28.965 --> 08:30.931
in a life-threatening situation.
- John.

08:35.620 --> 08:36.827
With endorphins,

08:36.931 --> 08:41.000
you can power your way
through any obstacle.

08:41.103 --> 08:42.172
Oh!

08:42.275 --> 08:43.827
Foul.

08:43.931 --> 08:46.620
With adrenaline in your veins,

08:46.724 --> 08:47.689
nothing can get in your way!

08:47.793 --> 08:49.413
Oh, Jesus.

08:49.517 --> 08:51.689
That's a goal-tend.

08:51.793 --> 08:56.448
Okay, nothing can get in my way.

08:56.551 --> 08:57.827
Gotcha!

08:57.931 --> 08:58.724
Oh, gotcha, big man.

09:01.103 --> 09:02.034
Let me get it!

09:02.137 --> 09:05.931
You're a filthy, scumbag,
dirty-ass...

09:06.034 --> 09:08.344
- I get it.
- Trifling player.

09:08.448 --> 09:10.724
And you're always gonna be
a dirty player.

09:10.827 --> 09:12.241
Let's go!

09:12.344 --> 09:13.862
With endorphins...

09:13.965 --> 09:15.551
everything is possible!

09:16.620 --> 09:17.551
Oh!

09:17.655 --> 09:18.586
What?

09:20.206 --> 09:21.034
How?

09:23.206 --> 09:24.758
- Ow!

09:24.862 --> 09:27.344
- So there was an incident

09:27.448 --> 09:29.896
on the basketball court
this morning

09:30.000 --> 09:33.655
involving two
Hampton DeVille employees.

09:33.758 --> 09:35.068
You and me.

09:35.172 --> 09:37.275
And I think
what we've learned

09:37.379 --> 09:40.862
is that people--

09:40.965 --> 09:42.275
me and you--

09:42.379 --> 09:44.862
make mistakes.

09:44.965 --> 09:47.310
And nobody is really
at fault here.

09:48.379 --> 09:49.448
Okay?

09:50.896 --> 09:52.310
- Yeah, it's okay.

09:52.413 --> 09:53.517
- Good.

09:53.620 --> 09:54.482
Good meeting...

09:54.586 --> 09:56.241
and great game.

10:02.137 --> 10:03.344
You ever have
one of those dreams

10:03.448 --> 10:05.620
that are so vivid,
you'd swear it's real?

10:05.724 --> 10:06.551
- All the time, man.

10:08.724 --> 10:09.551
- Who are you?

10:09.655 --> 10:11.172
- I'm Kevin.

10:11.275 --> 10:13.172
I've been hitting the drugs
pretty hard since my dog died,

10:13.275 --> 10:15.103
so I traded my office to Jake
for painkillers.

10:15.206 --> 10:17.000
- Oh.

10:18.379 --> 10:20.103
- How are you?

10:20.206 --> 10:22.275
-  I'm having
a little bit of a rough day,

10:22.379 --> 10:23.517
but I'm okay.

10:23.620 --> 10:24.586
How are you?

10:24.689 --> 10:26.689
- Good. I'm on drugs.

10:26.793 --> 10:28.241
- No, don't do that.

10:28.344 --> 10:29.586
Do what I said.

10:29.689 --> 10:32.241
Trust me, if you saw how I look,
you would do what I said.

10:32.344 --> 10:33.827
- Can I help you?

10:33.931 --> 10:36.172
- Um, I just came
to talk to Jake.

10:36.275 --> 10:37.827
- Do you have an appointment
with Mr. Levinson?

10:37.931 --> 10:39.482
- It's okay, Jane.

10:39.586 --> 10:41.965
Tell him to wait a minute,
and we'll grab some grub.

10:42.068 --> 10:43.793
Mom, how many times
do I have to tell you

10:43.896 --> 10:45.068
he's not hot enough for you?

10:45.172 --> 10:48.206
You're an amazing woman,
and you deserve the hottest.

10:48.310 --> 10:49.620
Thanks for picking up lunch,
Grace.

10:49.724 --> 10:51.103
- That's what friends do:

10:51.206 --> 10:54.896
give each other stuff that
makes their bodies feel good.

11:01.000 --> 11:02.689
- So, Jake, how many pills
do you have left?

11:02.793 --> 11:05.310
- I blew a bunch on a key to
the 49th floor vending machine,

11:05.413 --> 11:07.068
but I've got enough left
for one big trade.

11:07.172 --> 11:11.655
Ooh, and I think I know
what it's going to be.

11:15.137 --> 11:15.931
- A car?

11:16.034 --> 11:18.000
- No, I want that parking spot.

11:18.103 --> 11:19.310
It's right by the elevator,

11:19.413 --> 11:20.586
no cars on either side.

11:20.689 --> 11:21.655
It's convenient,
but more importantly

11:21.758 --> 11:23.275
a real status symbol.

11:23.379 --> 11:26.586
- Uh, there's no chance
you're gonna get that spot.

11:26.689 --> 11:28.241
It belongs to Peg Peterson.

11:28.344 --> 11:30.034
She's the most well-balanced
person I've ever met.

11:30.137 --> 11:33.344
I don't think she's been sad
a day in her life.

11:33.448 --> 11:35.517
- Okay, well, it was good
hearing from you.

11:35.620 --> 11:37.827
Yeah. Have a great day, Todd.

11:37.931 --> 11:39.103
Okay.

11:39.206 --> 11:40.068
Oh, hello.

11:40.172 --> 11:41.724
I'm sorry,
that was a telemarketer.

11:41.827 --> 11:43.172
What can I help you with?

11:43.275 --> 11:45.241
- I'm sorry, but I was walking
by your office,

11:45.344 --> 11:47.448
and I couldn't help but notice
that your name is Peg Peterson.

11:47.551 --> 11:49.413
This is a long shot,

11:49.517 --> 11:52.482
but do you happen to know
a Lenny Peterson?

11:52.586 --> 11:53.586
- Uh, I don't think so.

11:53.689 --> 11:54.862
- Well, he's great,

11:54.965 --> 11:56.724
and it's great to meet
another Peterson.

11:56.827 --> 11:58.137
Anyway, how are you?

11:58.241 --> 12:00.620
- I'm doing really well,
thank you for asking.

12:00.724 --> 12:02.034
And how are you?

12:02.137 --> 12:04.482
Um, what's that back brace for?

12:04.586 --> 12:05.724
- Oh, this old thing?

12:05.827 --> 12:07.034
I just had
a little spinal surgery.

12:07.137 --> 12:08.172
Don't worry about me.

12:08.275 --> 12:09.620
Yeah, it hurts a little bit,

12:09.724 --> 12:11.827
but everyone has pain, right?

12:11.931 --> 12:13.172
Right, Peg?

12:13.275 --> 12:15.000
- I'm sorry to hear
about your spine,

12:15.103 --> 12:17.206
but you know what always
makes me feel better

12:17.310 --> 12:18.586
is a candy cane.

12:18.689 --> 12:20.275
- Candy, huh?

12:20.379 --> 12:21.965
Ever had this kind of candy,
Peg?

12:24.137 --> 12:27.000
- Are those
prescription painkillers?

12:27.103 --> 12:29.344
- These make everybody
feel better about everything.

12:29.448 --> 12:31.103
I could give you
the rest of the bottle,

12:31.206 --> 12:33.689
but I'm gonna need
more than a candy cane, Peg.

12:33.793 --> 12:35.689
Maybe your parking spot?

12:36.896 --> 12:38.862
- Oh, it's 2:00.

12:38.965 --> 12:40.965
It's time
for my afternoon treat.

12:41.068 --> 12:43.517
Ice cream sandwiches
are the only drug I need.

12:49.862 --> 12:50.896
- Bonne nuit.

12:52.413 --> 12:53.206
- Buenas noches.

12:59.448 --> 13:00.827
- What?

13:27.862 --> 13:28.724
Hey, ghost?

13:28.827 --> 13:30.586
What are you typing?

13:30.689 --> 13:33.310
-  I have to finish
these bullshit reports.

13:36.620 --> 13:38.758
- Hey, ghost?

13:38.862 --> 13:40.482
What's it like being dead?

13:42.310 --> 13:45.482
Being dead is great in theory.
You know?

13:45.586 --> 13:46.655
You don't feel any pain.

13:46.758 --> 13:48.137
You can have sex
without condoms.

13:48.241 --> 13:50.620
But the problem is, you just
get used to it, you know?

13:50.724 --> 13:53.931
And then being dead just sucks
as much as being alive.

13:54.034 --> 13:56.448
It's like,
there's no greener grass.

13:56.551 --> 13:58.827
There's just more grass.

13:58.931 --> 14:01.241
Fuck, you just made me
type "grass"!

14:05.137 --> 14:06.827
Oh!
- Hi, Matt.

14:06.931 --> 14:09.517
Did you know
this is the women's restroom?

14:10.896 --> 14:13.448
And also you're asleep
on a toilet.

14:20.896 --> 14:22.275
- What's wrong, Matt?

14:22.379 --> 14:23.724
- I don't know, Kevin.

14:23.827 --> 14:25.827
These death records
are giving me weird nightmares.

14:28.827 --> 14:29.793
Madeline?

14:29.896 --> 14:30.827
Smoker, foul-mouthed,

14:30.931 --> 14:34.068
died of an amphetamine overdose.

14:34.172 --> 14:35.068
Oh, my God.

14:36.724 --> 14:37.758
She's real.

14:37.862 --> 14:39.068
- Who's real?

14:39.172 --> 14:40.620
- The ghost from my dreams.

14:40.724 --> 14:41.655
Wait, no, I'm sorry.

14:41.758 --> 14:43.724
I don't believe in ghosts.

14:43.827 --> 14:44.827
- I do.

14:44.931 --> 14:46.241
If ghosts aren't real,

14:46.344 --> 14:47.793
how do you explain

14:47.896 --> 14:49.482
the existence of ghosts?

14:49.586 --> 14:50.517
Huh?
- You're right.

14:50.620 --> 14:52.172
You can't explain it.
- No.

14:52.275 --> 14:54.413
I listen to ghost hunting
podcasts while I work,

14:54.517 --> 14:56.310
and they all say
that if you meet a ghost,

14:56.413 --> 14:58.137
you're supposed to find
where they died

14:58.241 --> 15:02.137
so they can be released
to the afterlife.

15:02.241 --> 15:03.862
- It says she died on floor 33.

15:03.965 --> 15:05.793
- I know all about floor 33.

15:05.896 --> 15:07.862
It's abandoned.

15:07.965 --> 15:09.965
Supposed to be pretty spooky.

15:10.068 --> 15:12.551
I'll go get my ghost rods.

15:12.655 --> 15:13.793
- Thanks, Kev.

15:16.965 --> 15:19.655
- Are you gonna go get
your rods?

15:19.758 --> 15:21.034
- Oh!
- Yeah.

15:21.137 --> 15:23.551
- Yeah, right, ghost rods.
Right.

15:27.103 --> 15:29.000
- What's wrong?

15:29.103 --> 15:30.965
No ice cream sandwiches?

15:31.068 --> 15:34.241
- Someone threw them
into the sink and smashed them.

15:35.896 --> 15:37.482
- Oh, no.

15:37.586 --> 15:39.827
I guess the world is cruel.

15:39.931 --> 15:41.241
Right, Peg?

15:41.344 --> 15:43.724
Lucky for you...

15:43.827 --> 15:45.413
I have these.

15:46.758 --> 15:47.517
- You know what?

15:47.620 --> 15:49.068
I think I'm gonna treat myself

15:49.172 --> 15:50.827
to a walk in the park.

15:50.931 --> 15:52.551
Why don't you come join me?

16:05.689 --> 16:07.758
- Why'd they shut this floor
down?

16:07.862 --> 16:09.241
- It wasn't wheelchair
accessible,

16:09.344 --> 16:11.413
and they didn't want to pay
to install a ramp.

16:11.517 --> 16:13.758
- Oh.

16:13.862 --> 16:14.586
Spider!

16:14.689 --> 16:15.689
Oh, don't.

16:19.586 --> 16:21.172
- Oh, my God.
Kevin, it's her office.

16:21.275 --> 16:22.827
- Oh, man.

16:22.931 --> 16:24.620
My rods are really
starting to freak out.

16:24.724 --> 16:26.379
Uh, maybe we should go back
to the office

16:26.482 --> 16:28.034
and take some pain pills
and forget about this.

16:28.137 --> 16:29.758
- No, I'm going in.

16:31.034 --> 16:33.206
Matt! Matt, no!

16:41.655 --> 16:44.827
It says
"deceased found on couch."

16:47.448 --> 16:49.413
Oh, my God, we found
her final resting place.

16:49.517 --> 16:51.172
Now she can be released.

16:51.275 --> 16:52.344
Kev?

16:55.206 --> 16:59.620
Huh. Resting place.

16:59.724 --> 17:01.000
- Look, Jake,

17:01.103 --> 17:02.586
it's not like I don't understand

17:02.689 --> 17:04.620
that there's darkness in life.

17:04.724 --> 17:06.172
Okay, let me tell you a story.

17:06.275 --> 17:08.413
So when I was a kid,
my parents were divorced,

17:08.517 --> 17:10.310
and I lived with my mother.

17:10.413 --> 17:13.206
And one night, we woke up,
and the house was on fire.

17:13.310 --> 17:14.379
So we ran out,

17:14.482 --> 17:17.793
and my mother ran back in
to save my dog,

17:17.896 --> 17:20.793
and that's when my father
kidnapped me.

17:20.896 --> 17:24.103
Because it turns out that
he had started the fire

17:24.206 --> 17:26.137
to get back at my mother, so...

17:26.241 --> 17:29.413
anyway, three months later,
the FBI found us

17:29.517 --> 17:32.034
and shot my father
through the brain

17:32.137 --> 17:33.448
right in front of me.

17:33.551 --> 17:36.448
But on the way
to the police station,

17:36.551 --> 17:39.655
a federal agent handed me
an ice cream sandwich.

17:39.758 --> 17:40.827
So yeah,

17:40.931 --> 17:41.931
I could easily

17:42.034 --> 17:43.793
look back at what happened

17:43.896 --> 17:45.517
and focus on the negative.

17:45.620 --> 17:49.172
Or I could remember that
no matter how bad things get,

17:49.275 --> 17:50.620
there's always
an ice cream sandwich

17:50.724 --> 17:52.000
around the corner.

17:53.655 --> 17:55.620
- I just want to take a minute
to deeply apologize

17:55.724 --> 17:58.931
for throwing away
your ice cream sandwiches.

17:59.034 --> 18:01.068
- There's just one more thing
I want to show you.

18:04.379 --> 18:05.758
- Well...

18:05.862 --> 18:07.172
you released me.

18:07.275 --> 18:09.137
So now I get to move on.

18:09.241 --> 18:10.241
To hell.

18:10.344 --> 18:12.551
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- It's fine.

18:12.655 --> 18:14.448
I was a terrible person,
so it doesn't matter.

18:14.551 --> 18:16.310
Hell's better than working
at Hampton DeVille, right?

18:16.413 --> 18:18.000
- Yeah, I'm not cut out
for working here.

18:18.103 --> 18:19.620
- No one is.

18:19.724 --> 18:21.896
You just find your way to cope,
and you just keep going.

18:22.000 --> 18:23.206
- So is that it?

18:23.310 --> 18:24.448
- Yeah.

18:24.551 --> 18:25.931
Unless you want to make out.

18:26.034 --> 18:28.172
- Do you want to make out?

18:28.275 --> 18:29.206
- Yeah, whatever.

18:29.310 --> 18:31.448
I mean, I'm a ghost.
Who cares?

18:32.586 --> 18:33.655
- Oh!

18:40.413 --> 18:41.724
- You know, Jake,
I really do believe

18:41.827 --> 18:43.931
that putting positivity
into the world

18:44.034 --> 18:46.275
is kind of its own reward.

18:46.379 --> 18:48.862
That's why I'm giving you
my parking space.

18:48.965 --> 18:50.827
- Wow. Peg.

18:50.931 --> 18:52.137
Thank you.

18:52.241 --> 18:54.344
But after all you've been
through, I feel kind of bad

18:54.448 --> 18:56.103
taking your parking spot.

18:56.206 --> 18:58.206
I definitely still will,
but I feel bad.

18:58.310 --> 19:00.724
- Don't worry about me.

19:00.827 --> 19:01.965
Oh, and remember,

19:02.068 --> 19:03.241
always look on the bright--

19:03.344 --> 19:06.034
- ♪ Nothing is good enough

19:06.137 --> 19:09.379
♪ For people like you

19:09.482 --> 19:13.379
♪ Who have to have
someone take the fall ♪

19:15.413 --> 19:18.413
♪ And something to sabotage

19:18.517 --> 19:23.379
♪ Determined to lose it all

19:23.482 --> 19:26.413
♪ Nothing is

19:26.517 --> 19:29.206
♪ Good enough

19:37.827 --> 19:39.448
- John told me
to drop these off here.

19:41.517 --> 19:42.448
Whoa!

19:42.551 --> 19:43.827
You're the ghost.

19:43.931 --> 19:46.206
I found out where you died
and took a nap there.

19:46.310 --> 19:47.413
- What are you talking about?

19:47.517 --> 19:48.689
- Oh.

19:48.793 --> 19:50.482
I guess that was a dream.

19:50.586 --> 19:51.517
- Gross. Don't dream about me.

19:51.620 --> 19:53.689
- Oh, no, it wasn't you.

19:53.793 --> 19:55.793
You were a dream ghost,
and I released you to hell.

19:55.896 --> 19:57.931
And then we made out,
but it was your idea.

19:58.034 --> 19:58.931
I--listen.

19:59.034 --> 20:00.551
I'm not explaining this well.

20:00.655 --> 20:02.413
Here's the thing.
I'm a good guy.

20:02.517 --> 20:03.793
And if we got to know
each other,

20:03.896 --> 20:06.689
we'd laugh about this,
and, uh...

20:06.793 --> 20:08.965
if we hung out, uh,
we'd probably become friends.

20:09.068 --> 20:11.482
I know that this is
a weird situation.

20:11.586 --> 20:12.965
We all know that, both of us,

20:13.068 --> 20:16.517
and, uh, I just want you to know
that I'm with you on this.

20:16.620 --> 20:18.241
Bottom line,
I need you to trust me

20:18.344 --> 20:19.310
that I'm a good person.

20:19.413 --> 20:20.586
That's it.

20:20.689 --> 20:22.000
- Don't ever talk to me again.

20:22.103 --> 20:23.068
- Okay.

20:25.241 --> 20:26.103
- I hate all men.

20:39.724 --> 20:40.655
- Hey, Grace.

20:40.758 --> 20:43.000
Here you go, kiddo.
- Jake!

20:47.000 --> 20:48.000
- Man, Kevin,

20:48.103 --> 20:49.827
it's been so much easier
to get my work done

20:49.931 --> 20:51.344
now that I found
my new napping place.

20:51.448 --> 20:52.793
- Who's Kevin?

20:52.896 --> 20:55.137
- Jake? But what happened to...

20:55.241 --> 20:58.724
was Kevin a ghost?

20:58.827 --> 21:00.310
- No, I just gave him
his office back.

21:00.413 --> 21:01.517
- Oh.

21:01.620 --> 21:02.965
That makes sense.

21:03.068 --> 21:05.241
- There's a spider
on your shoulder.

21:11.724 --> 21:13.103
- Wow, buddy.

21:13.206 --> 21:14.068
You play dirty.

21:15.344 --> 21:17.310
Filthy.

21:17.413 --> 21:18.862
I like that.

21:18.965 --> 21:20.758
I like that, buddy.

21:20.862 --> 21:21.793
Let's go!

21:24.551 --> 21:25.482
Foul.
