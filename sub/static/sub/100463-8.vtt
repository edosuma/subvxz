WEBVTT

00:20.603 --> 00:22.897
Félix Gallardo came to my ranch

00:23.440 --> 00:26.776
sometime back with Don Neto.

00:28.236 --> 00:30.572
That'd be Ernesto Fonseca Carrillo?

00:30.655 --> 00:31.865
Yeah.

00:32.741 --> 00:34.159
Always liked Neto.

00:34.826 --> 00:35.869
Smart.

00:38.455 --> 00:40.040
Not smart enough, I guess.

00:42.751 --> 00:44.919
Félix was talking about weed.

00:45.462 --> 00:46.880
Building something.

00:47.547 --> 00:49.632
Full of the same old shit.

00:52.177 --> 00:53.803
And then what happened?

00:53.887 --> 00:58.183
Félix gets in with these motherfuckers
in Colombia, Mexico City.

00:59.976 --> 01:01.478
That's a new kind of shit.

01:03.063 --> 01:05.023
They're the ones fucking everything up.

01:07.484 --> 01:09.527
And you can give me their names?

01:10.403 --> 01:11.571
Oh, yeah.

01:15.867 --> 01:19.162
Pablo...<i> </i>my newspaper will print it.

01:19.245 --> 01:21.289
The <i>Sun-Times </i>has a good history
with that.

01:21.372 --> 01:24.459
But you're making
some serious accusations here.

01:25.293 --> 01:26.961
Dangerous accusations.

01:27.462 --> 01:28.797
Why are you doing this?

01:29.756 --> 01:31.091
These assholes...

01:31.591 --> 01:32.550
Félix,

01:33.593 --> 01:36.763
his Mexico City friends,

01:36.846 --> 01:38.181
are desperate.

01:39.140 --> 01:42.060
The whole thing is, uh... shaky.

01:43.686 --> 01:45.772
One kick in the right spot...

01:51.402 --> 01:52.862
As long as you're sure.

01:57.575 --> 01:58.952
Next question.

03:36.090 --> 03:38.176
What do you have on the Palma thing?

03:38.259 --> 03:41.763
<i>You were right.</i>
<i>Clavel tipped him.</i>

03:42.263 --> 03:44.432
Turns out he was fucking the wife.

03:46.893 --> 03:48.853
You see
this fucking Acosta article?

03:49.771 --> 03:51.731
<i>We need to find him now.</i>

03:51.814 --> 03:55.610
<i>Acosta's pissed off</i>
<i>a lot of people. We'll get him.</i>

03:55.693 --> 03:57.612
Yeah, but when? Uh--

03:57.695 --> 04:01.783
You have any idea
what this could do to us?

04:01.866 --> 04:04.244
We lose the election, we lose protection.

04:04.327 --> 04:08.081
Americans back at my throat.

04:08.164 --> 04:10.708
These people looking for him,
they'll find him.

04:10.792 --> 04:12.168
<i>They'd better.</i>

04:16.464 --> 04:18.883
FAMOUS MEXICAN NARCO
TELLS EVERYTHING TO U.S. PRESS

04:34.023 --> 04:35.316
Mimi?

04:36.401 --> 04:37.902
-Are you there?

05:05.596 --> 05:06.806
Mimi?

05:48.431 --> 05:50.141
- Wake the fuck up.

05:50.224 --> 05:54.187
Every time I use someone else's
shitter, they're out of fucking paper.

05:54.270 --> 05:57.273
Look who's up.
<i>Special </i>Agent Breslin.

05:57.357 --> 06:00.443
You always start your day
with a little B and E, Breslin?

06:00.526 --> 06:01.569
The window was open.

06:01.652 --> 06:03.780
Thought I'd take a look around.

06:03.863 --> 06:05.198
Who the fuck are you guys?

06:05.281 --> 06:07.408
This thing real, Sacksy?

06:07.492 --> 06:08.993
Shit feels like tin.

06:09.077 --> 06:11.829
It's DEA. One step up from park ranger.

06:13.289 --> 06:14.290
Ah.

06:15.083 --> 06:16.209
FBI.

06:16.793 --> 06:17.710
Out of Houston.

06:17.794 --> 06:20.463
How's that "War on Drugs" coming, sport?

06:20.546 --> 06:22.173
You boys about to declare victory?

06:22.256 --> 06:24.300
Yeah. Any day now.

06:25.134 --> 06:26.761
The fuck are you doing here?

06:27.470 --> 06:29.013
I'm looking for the girl who lives here.

06:29.097 --> 06:30.223
What about?

06:31.140 --> 06:33.393
Known associate sort of thing.

06:33.476 --> 06:35.937
Hoping she'll steer you
to Pablo Acosta?

06:36.896 --> 06:38.606
You guys are onto him?

06:40.066 --> 06:41.526
What, are you working a US warrant?

06:41.609 --> 06:43.111
Never mind what we're working.

06:45.530 --> 06:47.573
What does FBI want with Acosta?

06:48.157 --> 06:49.867
I mean, shouldn't you guys be...

06:49.951 --> 06:52.412
bagging some rich asshole
for miscounting his money?

06:54.163 --> 06:55.623
Well, let's just say...

06:57.834 --> 07:00.253
we got a call from some decision-makers.

07:01.045 --> 07:04.340
Asked us to set up a joint-op
with the MexFeds.

07:04.424 --> 07:05.633
But we make the calls.

07:05.716 --> 07:08.010
See, we've got the kind of say-so
you low-rent powder cops

07:08.094 --> 07:09.262
only dream about down there.

07:10.888 --> 07:11.931
Check this out.

07:12.432 --> 07:15.226
You know they got dogs at the airport
that can do your job now?

07:16.769 --> 07:18.187
That don't bother you?

07:18.771 --> 07:21.649
No. They're smart dogs.

07:23.151 --> 07:26.654
Well, it's been a real pleasure here,
boys, but I gotta get going.

07:29.782 --> 07:30.950
Sit down.

07:33.494 --> 07:34.704
Sit the fuck down.

07:40.460 --> 07:43.963
Now, you don't play along,
we turn gears in DC,

07:44.046 --> 07:47.467
and you end up
chained to a fucking desk in Tulsa.

07:52.847 --> 07:55.641
Look, I ain't got shit.

07:55.725 --> 07:58.728
I got tipped off that Acosta
was looking to turn.

07:59.604 --> 08:01.814
I thought maybe his girl
would help me find him.

08:03.274 --> 08:05.902
Now I got nothing. My play's fucked, so...

08:06.486 --> 08:08.613
You guys want him? Take him.

08:09.280 --> 08:11.866
Plenty of other dirtbags out there
in the world for me to go after.

08:13.618 --> 08:15.912
Special agent's starting
to catch on, Sacksy.

08:15.995 --> 08:17.288
Making the right noises.

08:18.456 --> 08:19.916
So am I free to go?

08:23.169 --> 08:24.420
Acosta...

08:25.213 --> 08:26.464
or his girl...

08:27.006 --> 08:28.257
reach out to you...

08:31.469 --> 08:32.929
You'll be my first call.

08:35.765 --> 08:36.933
Attaboy.

08:38.434 --> 08:39.810
Well, good luck with him.

08:41.270 --> 08:43.105
He's a fucking wild one.

08:43.189 --> 08:45.733
-Harder they come...
-The harder we come.

08:45.816 --> 08:47.276
Mm-hmm.

08:47.360 --> 08:48.611
That's disgusting.

08:49.320 --> 08:51.197
<i>A huge turnout is expected</i>

08:51.280 --> 08:53.115
<i>for today's presidential election,</i>

08:53.199 --> 08:56.327
<i>as polling stations across the country</i>
<i>prepare to open...</i>

08:59.080 --> 09:00.790
Good morning, Félix.

09:01.791 --> 09:02.708
Hello.

09:03.251 --> 09:05.628
Leave us. Five minutes.

09:05.711 --> 09:07.255
This is my office.

09:25.856 --> 09:30.111
Our friends want to make sure today
goes smoothly, so I'm going to observe.

09:31.862 --> 09:32.989
I understand.

09:33.072 --> 09:34.240
I'm not sure you do.

09:34.824 --> 09:36.951
They saw this interview, Pablo Acosta.

09:37.618 --> 09:39.745
-One of your--
-It's being handled.

09:39.829 --> 09:42.123
Traffickers giving interviews.

09:42.623 --> 09:45.543
Another article like that,
doesn't matter what you pull off today.

09:50.881 --> 09:52.508
There it is.

09:53.175 --> 09:55.094
It's just what you asked for.

09:55.636 --> 09:57.513
You can call it anti-SNIPE.

09:57.597 --> 10:02.393
A duplicate version of SNIPE
that displays false election results.

10:03.144 --> 10:05.271
Each version has its own password.

10:06.981 --> 10:08.733
Enter one...

10:13.029 --> 10:16.657
get fake results,
where we seem to be winning.

10:16.741 --> 10:19.619
But enter the other one...

10:24.707 --> 10:27.084
get the real results.

10:28.919 --> 10:30.004
<i>Chapo.</i>

10:30.546 --> 10:33.549
You need to get Lupita some money.

10:33.633 --> 10:36.927
Tell her to take the kids and lay low.

10:42.391 --> 10:44.268
And that I love her.

10:44.935 --> 10:46.896
I'll take care of it, don't worry.

10:47.521 --> 10:50.483
<i>I want to put a bullet</i>
<i>in those sons of bitches</i>

10:50.566 --> 10:52.234
<i>for what they did to you and Cochi.</i>

10:52.318 --> 10:54.820
Chapito, listen to me.

10:54.904 --> 10:56.781
This shit with Félix...

10:57.406 --> 10:59.742
it's all good for us.

11:00.701 --> 11:02.495
We just have to wait it out.

11:03.913 --> 11:05.706
When the time comes,

11:05.790 --> 11:11.420
<i>we'll have to get in line</i>
<i>to put a bullet in his head.</i>

11:13.798 --> 11:16.217
<i>Polls are now open nationwide.</i>

11:16.300 --> 11:19.762
<i>We'll be reporting throughout the day</i>
<i>on the numbers.</i>

11:19.845 --> 11:22.848
<i>At 6 p.m. local time...</i>

11:22.932 --> 11:24.684
Think it's too early for a drink?

11:31.857 --> 11:32.858
Hello?

11:32.942 --> 11:34.318
<i>You sound tired, Félix.</i>

11:36.112 --> 11:38.781
What can I do for you, Pacho?

11:39.240 --> 11:40.825
Hold on a second.

11:43.452 --> 11:44.328
Pacho?

11:48.541 --> 11:51.669
The reason I'm calling
is your load is ready.

11:51.752 --> 11:52.962
My what?

11:53.879 --> 11:54.880
Hold on...

11:56.132 --> 11:57.174
The coke?

11:57.258 --> 12:00.344
<i>You didn't plan on asking</i>
<i>for the 70 tons, did you?</i>

12:02.513 --> 12:05.433
Of course, I just didn't think
you'd get it together so fast.

12:05.516 --> 12:07.727
But you said you needed the money,

12:09.019 --> 12:11.021
so I got it done.

12:11.939 --> 12:16.360
Consider it a personal favor.

12:17.737 --> 12:19.488
It's not a problem, is it?

12:21.907 --> 12:24.952
No, of course not. Don't worry.

12:25.035 --> 12:26.162
<i>Good.</i>

12:27.371 --> 12:30.207
<i>I'd hate to see you</i>
<i>step in your own bullshit.</i>

12:33.085 --> 12:34.336
Félix...

12:35.421 --> 12:38.132
you do know what happens
if you fuck this up?

12:43.596 --> 12:45.514
-Hello?
-It's me.

12:46.348 --> 12:48.309
How many times have I told you
not to call?

12:48.392 --> 12:49.894
Wait! Don't hang up.

12:49.977 --> 12:52.146
<i>This affects you and the kids.</i>

12:52.980 --> 12:54.815
Go ahead, I'm listening.

12:56.025 --> 12:58.486
I asked the Colombians for more product.

12:59.069 --> 13:00.488
<i>Seventy tons.</i>

13:01.238 --> 13:03.407
-Seventy?
- <i>Yeah.</i>

13:04.200 --> 13:06.911
You can imagine what would happen
if I can't get it through.

13:08.496 --> 13:13.626
And I need the government to do it,
which only happens if I win tonight.

13:14.376 --> 13:16.253
Win the election, Miguel?

13:16.921 --> 13:18.422
Yeah.

13:20.382 --> 13:22.176
You understand?

13:22.802 --> 13:25.387
<i>'Cause if this falls apart,</i>
<i>they'll come after everything.</i>

13:25.471 --> 13:26.889
Everyone.

13:27.890 --> 13:29.308
You understand?

13:30.476 --> 13:32.186
You don't have to explain.

13:33.729 --> 13:34.688
Good.

13:39.693 --> 13:41.695
You can't keep doing this, Miguel Ángel,

13:42.196 --> 13:44.031
making promises you can't keep.

13:47.576 --> 13:48.994
<i>I'm working on it.</i>

13:50.538 --> 13:52.248
<i>Good luck, Miguel.</i>

13:52.873 --> 13:55.209
<i>Acosta could be holed up on either side.</i>

13:55.292 --> 13:57.127
We're guessing they're trying
to pin him down here,

13:57.211 --> 13:58.712
let the MexFeds do the dirty work.

13:59.547 --> 14:02.216
<i>Well, they're definitely</i>
<i>not looking to put him in cuffs.</i>

14:02.758 --> 14:04.593
But maybe that'll give me a play.

14:04.677 --> 14:06.595
You know, I could offer protection.

14:06.679 --> 14:08.556
<i>As long as we take down Acosta.</i>

14:13.352 --> 14:15.187
We were so goddamn close.

14:15.271 --> 14:17.648
-What else you got?
- <i>Just the girl.</i>

14:18.065 --> 14:19.733
Who knows where the fuck she is?

14:38.836 --> 14:40.045
Thank you.

15:18.834 --> 15:20.586
Your dessert, my sweet.

15:27.801 --> 15:29.511
Look who's here.

15:30.888 --> 15:33.307
My little desert flower.

15:37.770 --> 15:39.271
You look terrible.

15:42.816 --> 15:44.276
How'd you find me?

15:46.070 --> 15:47.488
The article.

15:49.657 --> 15:52.242
You said you were in a safe place.

15:52.326 --> 15:54.703
I know you love it here.

15:55.704 --> 15:56.580
Oh.

15:57.247 --> 15:58.374
Smart.

16:00.042 --> 16:01.710
Or you said too much.

16:04.672 --> 16:07.132
It's fine, don't worry.

16:09.051 --> 16:10.803
It's insane, Pablo.

16:12.221 --> 16:14.014
You lit their house on fire.

16:15.307 --> 16:17.267
What'd you expect was gonna happen?

16:19.853 --> 16:21.271
Talk to me.

16:22.815 --> 16:25.526
What are you doing here? Huh?

16:25.609 --> 16:29.613
Besides smoking that shit
till your brain's fried?

16:33.909 --> 16:35.536
That why you left me?

16:43.252 --> 16:44.503
Come.

16:46.338 --> 16:47.464
Come.

16:53.095 --> 16:55.639
Take a walk with me.

17:12.114 --> 17:12.948
Amado!

17:15.034 --> 17:16.285
Call for you.

17:18.912 --> 17:19.830
From who?

17:19.913 --> 17:21.457
It's the boss.

17:23.542 --> 17:24.376
Yeah?

17:24.460 --> 17:26.587
I just got a call from Pacho.

17:27.254 --> 17:28.505
The load is ready now.

17:29.173 --> 17:31.008
<i>I agreed to pick it up Friday.</i>

17:31.550 --> 17:34.678
Friday?
Boss, there's no way we'll be ready.

17:34.762 --> 17:39.641
Figure it out. Because if you don't,
we're both dead, you understand?

17:49.359 --> 17:52.196
What is that, Pablo? Buried treasure?

17:52.279 --> 17:53.363
No.

17:54.031 --> 17:55.282
Better.

18:02.831 --> 18:04.833
Cold as the river.

18:11.465 --> 18:15.969
This where you took all the girls
when you were a little shit?

18:18.430 --> 18:21.725
How old do you think this beer is?

18:31.193 --> 18:35.280
So you left me
so you could talk with this reporter?

18:37.032 --> 18:38.033
No.

18:42.746 --> 18:44.414
Not the only reason.

18:47.126 --> 18:49.002
You've seen what they're capable of.

18:49.086 --> 18:51.130
I didn't want anyone coming after you.

18:52.673 --> 18:55.551
But I was always gonna find you
after it was done.

19:02.015 --> 19:03.016
I promise.

19:08.230 --> 19:10.566
Okay. But no more bullshit, Pablo.

19:16.113 --> 19:18.240
Next time, you tell me everything,

19:18.323 --> 19:21.201
or I'll drown you with your sack
of old fucking beers.

19:24.288 --> 19:25.747
That's my girl.

19:31.420 --> 19:34.339
<i>What happened to the deal with the DEA?</i>

19:34.882 --> 19:37.009
<i>This interview will be better.</i>

19:37.092 --> 19:40.095
Everyone believes the American press.

19:41.013 --> 19:47.019
But, Pablo, you didn't say anything
they can't deny.

19:47.102 --> 19:49.271
'Cause it's the first article, baby.

19:49.354 --> 19:51.356
There's a whole series.

19:51.440 --> 19:53.233
They're gonna put them out one by one.

19:54.067 --> 19:55.068
Huh?

19:55.777 --> 19:58.030
Each with more dirt than the last.

19:58.488 --> 20:01.116
Gonna pick those sons of bitches apart

20:01.200 --> 20:02.868
till there's nothing left.

20:04.995 --> 20:06.955
See those bluffs?

20:07.039 --> 20:12.377
Only one road through them,
and I got eyes on it all the time.

20:13.337 --> 20:15.797
They gotta cross the Rio Grande
to get to me.

20:15.881 --> 20:17.299
Boss.

20:19.551 --> 20:21.470
These are my people, Mimi.

20:21.553 --> 20:23.764
This is my fucking fortress.

20:23.847 --> 20:26.141
I know Félix is going to come after me
at some point.

20:27.100 --> 20:29.603
I can wait here, long as it takes,

20:29.686 --> 20:35.025
watching those articles go off
like fucking bombs. Boom, boom, boom.

20:36.818 --> 20:38.111
Blow his shit up.

20:42.824 --> 20:45.577
Well, I guess it ain't
any crazier than usual.

20:54.044 --> 20:55.504
Everything okay?

20:57.256 --> 20:59.549
The first results are starting to come in.

21:10.018 --> 21:12.187
<i>How do you run</i>
<i>a clean election in a country</i>

21:12.271 --> 21:14.273
<i>that's been defined by corruption?</i>

21:14.356 --> 21:15.899
<i>Transparency.</i>

21:16.441 --> 21:20.862
<i>In 1988, the Mexican election was gonna be</i>
<i>unlike any that had preceded it.</i>

21:23.532 --> 21:26.285
<i>Election monitors were placed</i>
<i>at each polling station</i>

21:26.368 --> 21:29.371
<i>and logged all the votes</i>
<i>on a single document called an "acta"</i>

21:29.454 --> 21:30.789
<i>or tally sheet.</i>

21:31.456 --> 21:34.543
<i>That way they could quickly call in</i>
<i>the numbers to the mainframe.</i>

21:35.168 --> 21:38.297
<i>The computer tabulated them</i>
<i>and sent the results upstairs</i>

21:38.380 --> 21:39.464
<i>to the observation room,</i>

21:39.965 --> 21:44.052
<i>where the results terminal displayed them</i>
<i>for the reporters and opposition parties.</i>

21:44.136 --> 21:48.348
<i>The most important among them</i>
<i>for the FDN, working for Cárdenas,</i>

21:48.432 --> 21:51.184
<i>former congressman Francisco Ovando.</i>

21:51.268 --> 21:55.147
<i>Now every political party and journalist</i>
<i>would have the results in real time.</i>

21:55.230 --> 21:58.859
<i>Because the vote was closely monitored,</i>
<i>it felt aboveboard,</i>

21:58.942 --> 22:01.111
<i>a new era of transparency.</i>

22:01.194 --> 22:02.904
<i>See all this glistening new tech?</i>

22:03.405 --> 22:04.573
<i>It has to be fair.</i>

22:05.115 --> 22:07.701
<i>Or at least that's what they</i>
<i>wanted everyone to think.</i>

22:22.049 --> 22:23.425
How's he seem to you?

22:25.635 --> 22:27.179
Little tweaked, but okay.

22:30.766 --> 22:31.767
He's ready.

22:35.437 --> 22:36.646
For what?

22:39.149 --> 22:40.484
Whatever comes.

22:47.282 --> 22:49.284
Sal, tell me you got something.

22:50.035 --> 22:51.578
<i>It's me, Walt.</i>

22:52.454 --> 22:53.580
Mimi.

22:54.790 --> 22:56.500
You got that deal you promised Pablo?

22:57.542 --> 22:58.627
I got it right here.

22:59.294 --> 23:00.754
Do you know where he is?

23:03.173 --> 23:05.509
Listen, Mimi, I'm not the only one
looking for him,

23:05.592 --> 23:07.427
but I'm the only one
that can keep him alive.

23:11.973 --> 23:12.974
Santa Elena.

23:13.475 --> 23:15.477
<i>You gotta come from the American side.</i>

23:27.155 --> 23:28.490
Show me.

23:39.334 --> 23:41.670
PRI's getting killed in Mexico City.

23:46.133 --> 23:47.300
Switch it over.

23:56.017 --> 23:57.936
You're doing better than I thought
in Mexico City.

23:59.146 --> 24:01.481
Still a ways to go, Francisco.

24:01.565 --> 24:03.567
<i>These poor assholes had no idea</i>

24:03.650 --> 24:05.193
<i>they were looking at fake results.</i>

24:05.277 --> 24:09.698
<i>And then, now this is important, they were</i>
<i>sending that bullshit out into the world.</i>

24:09.781 --> 24:11.658
<i>We're getting word now</i>

24:11.741 --> 24:13.452
<i>on results from the new SNIPE system.</i>

24:13.535 --> 24:16.830
<i>Because people are watching</i>
<i>these news reports all over the country.</i>

24:16.913 --> 24:19.416
<i>PRI is seeing</i>
<i>a huge surge in Mexico City.</i>

24:19.499 --> 24:22.002
<i>And soon as they see</i>
<i>the PRI's winning again,</i>

24:22.085 --> 24:23.712
<i>what do you think they'll do?</i>

24:23.795 --> 24:26.798
<i>Say, "Fuck it. I don't need to vote.</i>

24:26.882 --> 24:30.343
<i>It's a done deal.</i>
<i>PRI's gonna win yet again."</i>

24:30.427 --> 24:32.012
<i>It's called voter suppression.</i>

24:32.637 --> 24:35.307
<i>Something we have</i>
<i>a little experience with up north.</i>

24:35.891 --> 24:38.143
<i>Make it easier for those</i>
<i>whose vote you can count on.</i>

24:39.060 --> 24:40.896
<i>Make it harder for those you can't.</i>

24:41.605 --> 24:44.649
<i>That's how you rig an election</i>
<i>without leaving a lick of evidence.</i>

24:45.233 --> 24:48.487
Internal party polling confirms

24:48.570 --> 24:51.656
that voting outside Mexico City is down.

24:54.075 --> 24:55.535
It's working.

24:55.619 --> 24:58.955
At 8:00 p.m.,
we'll have de la Madrid go on TV

24:59.039 --> 25:02.626
to call the election in...
...favor.

25:03.335 --> 25:04.669
Good.

25:07.088 --> 25:11.635
Once he's in office,
I expect to be his first call.

25:17.849 --> 25:19.142
<i>What do you have for me?</i>

25:19.768 --> 25:21.937
I've got news from our friends in Juárez.

25:23.230 --> 25:24.481
What is it?

25:45.460 --> 25:50.215
Even with swollen feet,
the man can still dance.

25:52.384 --> 25:54.219
Remember the day we met?

25:54.302 --> 25:55.428
Yes.

25:56.137 --> 25:58.098
Party just like this.

25:58.974 --> 26:01.309
Only white girl for miles.

26:01.768 --> 26:03.270
Everyone looking at me strange.

26:04.229 --> 26:06.106
Not how I was looking at you.

26:06.189 --> 26:08.358
I saw you with different eyes.

26:28.587 --> 26:31.548
Hurry up.
We don't have all fucking day.

26:32.048 --> 26:33.133
One hundred pallets?

26:33.216 --> 26:34.301
It's set.

26:34.384 --> 26:37.637
Boss?
Can you come have a look at number four?

26:37.721 --> 26:39.514
There's something with the electrical.

26:51.943 --> 26:53.528
Can't I drink my fucking coffee in peace?

26:54.946 --> 26:56.364
Calm down.

27:02.704 --> 27:03.955
Let me see them.

27:10.045 --> 27:11.379
Scroll down.

27:38.865 --> 27:40.241
What the hell was that?

27:40.825 --> 27:41.951
That what?

27:43.036 --> 27:45.163
There were different results
on the screen.

27:45.246 --> 27:48.458
-What are you talking about, Francisco?
-Those look like passwords!

27:48.541 --> 27:51.503
Please don't touch my workstation.

27:51.586 --> 27:53.838
I was making adjustments to the software,
they're code.

27:55.090 --> 27:58.510
Right, they're code. Then enter them.
Let's see what happens.

27:59.010 --> 28:00.178
Go on. Do it!

28:00.261 --> 28:01.596
-What's going on?
-Don't yell at me!

28:01.680 --> 28:02.681
What's going on?

28:03.682 --> 28:06.101
There were different results
on the screen. That's what's going on!

28:06.685 --> 28:08.478
They're trying to screw us again!

28:09.979 --> 28:13.233
-Stop! Stop right there!
-No, I'm looking for Mimi.

28:13.316 --> 28:16.695
It's okay. He's a friend of Pablo's. Hi.

28:16.778 --> 28:18.988
Hey, we need to get Pablo
out of here now.

28:19.489 --> 28:21.366
What is it? What--?

28:21.449 --> 28:22.909
You got someone else looking for him?

28:22.992 --> 28:25.161
FBI, joint-op with MexFeds.

28:25.245 --> 28:26.663
They're not fucking around.

28:33.670 --> 28:35.046
Shut it down!

28:38.341 --> 28:39.718
Turn it off, goddamn it!

28:40.301 --> 28:41.636
It can't just be shut down.

28:43.012 --> 28:45.265
Show everyone what you're doing. Let's go.

28:45.348 --> 28:47.475
-I don't know what you're talking about.
-Oh, you don't?

28:47.559 --> 28:49.227
We have to find the Minister.

28:49.310 --> 28:50.687
Let me enter them.

28:50.770 --> 28:53.106
This is government property.
You do not come near it!

28:53.189 --> 28:54.733
Hold on a second.

29:00.947 --> 29:02.240
Wait! What happened?

29:02.323 --> 29:03.992
What just happened?

29:04.075 --> 29:06.953
-What did you do?
- The screens shut off.

29:14.461 --> 29:15.712
Fucking piece of shit!

29:16.755 --> 29:20.925
We strip it down, find the short,
go cable by cable.

29:21.718 --> 29:23.887
There's four kilometers of cables
on this plane, boss.

29:23.970 --> 29:26.514
You want to take a break or something?

29:26.598 --> 29:27.682
-No, boss.
-No?

29:27.766 --> 29:29.225
-No.
-You want to tell Félix

29:29.309 --> 29:32.771
his coke isn't coming
because we couldn't fix a goddamn wire?

29:33.730 --> 29:36.941
-No, boss.
-All right, then. Get started.

29:37.025 --> 29:38.193
Yes, boss.

29:43.198 --> 29:46.785
Those sons of bitches have been
pulling this shit for too long!

29:46.868 --> 29:48.578
You don't know what you're talking about!

29:48.661 --> 29:51.164
You're the one manipulating the computers!

29:51.831 --> 29:54.167
Gentlemen. Quiet, please.

29:55.418 --> 29:56.711
Thank you.

29:57.754 --> 30:00.423
I've been down to the mainframe.
It seems we've had a technical problem.

30:02.425 --> 30:03.760
Our system crashed.

30:03.843 --> 30:06.262
Mr. Secretary, what does that mean?

30:07.597 --> 30:10.016
Moreño, please explain.

30:11.392 --> 30:12.393
Explain.

30:13.353 --> 30:14.187
Go on.

30:20.902 --> 30:25.615
The code we are utilizing
is a complex system

30:26.324 --> 30:27.867
with a lot of data.

30:29.077 --> 30:33.331
And it overwhelmed the mainframe.

30:34.123 --> 30:35.458
He's covering!

30:35.542 --> 30:38.711
He doesn't want us to see
what he was doing with the passwords.

30:38.795 --> 30:40.296
It's bullshit!

30:40.421 --> 30:43.049
Francisco, I'm going to ask you

30:43.132 --> 30:45.426
to please not use
that kind of language here.

30:46.386 --> 30:49.055
It's a technical issue,
and it's out of our hands.

30:49.514 --> 30:51.057
Now if you'll excuse me.

30:51.140 --> 30:53.434
It's a lie. You know it's a lie!

30:54.185 --> 30:55.895
Maybe it's like the Apple III.

30:55.979 --> 30:59.065
Apple III, my ass! It's not fucking true!

31:24.299 --> 31:25.466
Shit.

31:26.509 --> 31:28.219
It's the federal police.

31:29.220 --> 31:32.307
Hello, you sons of bitches!

31:32.390 --> 31:34.684
How long you been waiting to say that?

31:43.067 --> 31:47.196
All right, only the ones with guns,
Wheels! You are good to return fire.

32:00.376 --> 32:01.544
Run!

32:01.628 --> 32:02.879
Everybody grab one!

32:09.260 --> 32:11.304
Hurry!

32:15.642 --> 32:16.643
Hurry!

32:18.311 --> 32:20.188
Let's go!

32:27.403 --> 32:29.781
<i>Convoy's en route.</i>
<i>Meet them at the square.</i>

32:29.864 --> 32:30.698
<i>Copy that.</i>

32:37.205 --> 32:39.791
- Where's Acosta?
-I don't know!

32:40.458 --> 32:43.711
Hell, yeah! Keep that fat boy rolling!

33:03.856 --> 33:05.858
It's right there, Walt!
Just a hundred yards more!

33:05.942 --> 33:06.776
-Hold on!
-Come on!

33:06.859 --> 33:08.194
Wait. Wait.

33:08.277 --> 33:09.404
Pablo Acosta!

33:11.197 --> 33:12.407
Acosta!

33:18.788 --> 33:20.164
All right. Come on, let's go.

33:30.133 --> 33:32.844
Gonna take a lot to get Acosta, fuckers!

33:38.766 --> 33:40.852
<i>Chopper Two.</i>
<i>We've got eyes on Acosta!</i>

33:40.935 --> 33:42.311
<i>He's on the north end of town.</i>

33:42.395 --> 33:45.398
<i>Meet at the rallying point.</i>
<i>We're gonna surround him.</i>

33:45.481 --> 33:48.192
<i>We are</i>
<i>receiving reports of irregularities</i>

33:48.276 --> 33:49.152
<i>with the SNIPE system.</i>

33:49.235 --> 33:51.529
<i>Questions have arisen regarding</i>
<i>the validity of the results.</i>

33:51.612 --> 33:56.451
It's all fucked. This is just going
to drive them all back to the polls.

33:58.202 --> 34:00.538
Can't we restart it?

34:00.621 --> 34:02.749
So they can see what we were doing?

34:02.832 --> 34:06.711
-There's something--
-The computer's done, Félix.

34:06.794 --> 34:07.795
It's over!

34:10.715 --> 34:12.508
So are you.

34:26.314 --> 34:28.691
It's right up there. That's Pablo's house.

34:28.775 --> 34:30.443
-Look, we're not gonna make it.
-I'm going.

34:30.526 --> 34:33.154
No, Mimi. You can't.

34:34.072 --> 34:36.616
Come here. Come here.

34:36.699 --> 34:37.700
Run!

34:37.784 --> 34:40.703
-Look, I gotta get you out of here.
-No, I'm not leaving him here, Walt.

34:40.787 --> 34:41.788
Mimi.

34:42.663 --> 34:44.832
Just give me some time
to figure something out.

34:44.916 --> 34:47.126
-Okay? Look at me. Look at me.
-I'm not going!

34:47.919 --> 34:51.547
Go with them down to the church,
and I'll come find you. All right?

34:51.631 --> 34:54.884
-I'm not going, Walt.
-Look at me. Look at me.

34:55.676 --> 34:56.803
Trust me.

34:57.553 --> 34:58.638
Okay?

35:05.603 --> 35:09.190
Take your positions!
Establish the perimeter!

35:09.273 --> 35:10.983
To the left!

35:11.067 --> 35:12.318
Come on!

35:15.404 --> 35:16.906
Hey, look who's here.

35:17.824 --> 35:19.534
"Just Say No."

35:20.118 --> 35:21.494
A day late and a peso short.

35:21.577 --> 35:22.662
Guys, listen.

35:22.745 --> 35:24.580
Instead of doubling down
on civilian casualties,

35:24.664 --> 35:27.708
how about I go in there and talk to him?
See if I can end this thing peacefully.

35:27.792 --> 35:29.418
What movie you've been watching, sport?

35:29.502 --> 35:31.254
See all that metal we took
from these beaners?

35:31.337 --> 35:33.965
<i>Señor </i>Acosta's not going
anywhere peacefully.

35:34.048 --> 35:37.260
Fuck off back to whatever bullshit
buy-bust you were on.

35:37.844 --> 35:39.470
Leave him to the FBI.

35:40.054 --> 35:42.223
Hey, are you sure you haven't seen my hat?

35:42.306 --> 35:44.892
I don't know
where your fucking hat is at, Sacks.

35:46.227 --> 35:48.771
-Here's your fucking hat.

35:55.987 --> 35:58.948
Hold your positions!

35:59.031 --> 36:01.409
Knew these clowns couldn't be in charge.

36:02.577 --> 36:04.412
They sure like to pretend they are.

36:05.496 --> 36:07.081
Typical gringos.

36:09.542 --> 36:10.710
Not here, Walt.

36:15.673 --> 36:16.799
What do you want?

36:17.884 --> 36:19.468
A fucking heads-up would've been nice.

36:19.552 --> 36:21.470
I should give you a heads-up
after you lied to me?

36:21.554 --> 36:23.055
I couldn't tell you at the time.

36:23.139 --> 36:25.892
Oh, yeah? And when exactly
did you plan on coming clean?

36:25.975 --> 36:28.811
After you got Acosta out and Félix
came asking why I didn't stop it?

36:28.895 --> 36:31.939
Because I would've been dead by then.
You lie to me, you get me fucking killed.

36:32.023 --> 36:34.567
I screwed up. But shit's changed now.

36:34.650 --> 36:35.943
All right, you got cover.

36:36.027 --> 36:37.862
The FBI, the gringos.

36:38.613 --> 36:41.532
Your boys in Mexico City,
they opened the door, they invited us in.

36:41.616 --> 36:43.993
All you have to say is these two dipshits
opened their mouth,

36:44.076 --> 36:45.745
and someone in FBI tipped DEA.

36:45.828 --> 36:47.747
Okay, I showed up, I fucked everything up,

36:47.830 --> 36:50.541
I got him across the border,
he disappears up north.

36:50.625 --> 36:52.043
No skin off your back.

36:52.877 --> 36:55.129
You want to take down Félix? This is it.

36:57.340 --> 36:58.507
All right?

36:58.591 --> 37:00.468
Give me five minutes in there,
and I swear to you

37:00.551 --> 37:01.844
I can get him to take this deal.

37:04.889 --> 37:08.059
I take Acosta off the table,
I get more pull with Félix.

37:08.142 --> 37:10.102
We go back to what we were doing
with better intel.

37:10.186 --> 37:12.230
-No. Bullshit!
-That's how Félix goes down.

37:12.980 --> 37:14.190
You listen to me, Walt.

37:15.274 --> 37:19.070
Pablo Acosta... is gonna die.

37:19.946 --> 37:21.072
Do you hear me?

37:24.742 --> 37:26.035
That's what you wanted.

37:47.431 --> 37:48.849
What the fuck is this?

37:50.101 --> 37:52.186
It's a tracking device.

38:13.749 --> 38:14.792
It's hard...

38:16.377 --> 38:17.962
trying to impress these people.

38:20.715 --> 38:25.678
I'm just a poor girl from Durango
in a thousand-dollar dress.

38:27.638 --> 38:30.683
You're an ex-cop who became a drug dealer.

38:30.766 --> 38:35.479
Like we know shit
about computers or elections.

38:38.733 --> 38:42.028
So busy pretending, we forgot who we were.

38:44.822 --> 38:47.491
Anyway, I was rooting for you.

39:06.052 --> 39:08.929
We still have time.
We just need to change them.

39:09.013 --> 39:10.973
There's not enough time
to change ballots, Félix.

39:11.057 --> 39:13.517
No, not the ballots.
We need to change these...

39:14.143 --> 39:16.437
the tally sheets.

39:16.520 --> 39:18.022
There are thousands of precincts.

39:18.105 --> 39:20.149
How the hell are you going
to get to them all?

39:22.943 --> 39:24.195
Boss wants a word.

39:32.286 --> 39:33.412
Miguel Ángel.

39:33.496 --> 39:35.039
<i>What's up, my friend?</i>

39:35.706 --> 39:37.083
<i>Where have you been?</i>

39:37.708 --> 39:38.834
<i>Can we talk?</i>

39:41.462 --> 39:42.713
Chapo, look...

39:44.423 --> 39:46.467
I know what happened with Palma
was unfortunate.

39:46.550 --> 39:48.677
<i>But we need to move past it.</i>

39:52.973 --> 39:55.017
We're more than a Federation, Chapo.

39:55.101 --> 39:59.730
Sometimes we fight, have our differences,
but in the end...

40:00.356 --> 40:02.608
we're still family.

40:02.691 --> 40:03.609
<i>Family?</i>

40:05.111 --> 40:07.196
Is that why you had Cochiloco killed?

40:08.823 --> 40:11.200
He gave me no choice, you know that.

40:11.700 --> 40:13.411
Fuck that, that's bullshit!

40:13.911 --> 40:14.787
<i>Look...</i>

40:15.913 --> 40:17.915
I understand you're angry, but...

40:18.916 --> 40:22.169
if our people don't win this election,
we all go down.

40:22.670 --> 40:25.840
The Federation's over.

40:25.923 --> 40:27.800
<i>I need your help right now.</i>

40:28.676 --> 40:30.928
Well, if you want us to still be "family,"

40:31.011 --> 40:32.471
<i>as you say,</i>

40:33.431 --> 40:35.474
let Héctor Palma come back.

40:39.812 --> 40:41.147
No questions asked.

40:45.651 --> 40:46.819
Okay, Chapo.

40:48.195 --> 40:49.363
Okay.

40:49.447 --> 40:52.783
You do this for me, I'll consider it.

40:54.201 --> 40:55.494
What do you need?

40:57.913 --> 40:59.081
Yes.

41:00.583 --> 41:01.876
Uh-huh.

41:04.462 --> 41:06.380
And what's in it for my family?

41:06.464 --> 41:07.756
What's in it for...?

41:09.967 --> 41:11.594
Look, Benjamín...

41:12.178 --> 41:14.138
we can't continue this way.

41:14.638 --> 41:16.891
-What are you talking about?
<i>-</i> <i>What am I talking about?</i>

41:18.559 --> 41:20.769
I need plaza bosses...

41:21.645 --> 41:24.023
who I can turn to for advice.

41:24.607 --> 41:27.443
People I know I can trust and trust me.

41:28.277 --> 41:29.278
That means, going forward,

41:29.361 --> 41:32.490
I'll be giving you the kind of say
in our business you've always wanted.

41:34.658 --> 41:36.702
<i>We're gonna need a lot more cocaine.</i>

41:36.785 --> 41:39.371
<i>And we're never sharing the plaza again</i>
<i>with anyone.</i>

41:39.455 --> 41:41.499
<i>Deal.</i>

41:42.374 --> 41:44.168
What do you need me to do?

41:47.671 --> 41:49.298
<i>Pablo Acosta!</i>

41:49.381 --> 41:51.926
<i>This is Commander Guillermo Calderoni</i>

41:52.468 --> 41:54.178
<i>of the Federal Judicial Police.</i>

41:54.762 --> 41:57.389
<i>You're surrounded on all sides.</i>

41:57.473 --> 41:59.850
<i>Come out with your hands in the air!</i>

41:59.934 --> 42:02.436
Go fuck your mother, Calderoni!

42:03.103 --> 42:04.980
You want me, come in and get me!

42:16.575 --> 42:19.203
Stop! Cease fire!

42:21.497 --> 42:22.706
Get the gasoline.

42:29.046 --> 42:31.382
Walt Breslin! DEA!
I'm going in!

42:31.465 --> 42:33.592
No, no, no, no, no. No!
Hold your fire!

42:33.676 --> 42:34.843
What the fuck is he doing?

42:34.927 --> 42:36.345
It's a DEA agent.

42:36.428 --> 42:38.597
Acosta, Walt Breslin!

42:38.681 --> 42:41.684
- Stand the fuck down, Breslin!
-Pablo, it's Walt! I'm coming in!

42:56.031 --> 42:58.075
That took some fucking balls.

42:59.076 --> 43:01.370
Hey, it's okay.

43:01.954 --> 43:04.331
They won't shoot with the gringo inside.

43:04.415 --> 43:05.791
Get two glasses.

43:16.260 --> 43:18.554
Whatever you got to say
must be important.

43:29.481 --> 43:32.026
I went to the US attorney in Houston.

43:32.735 --> 43:33.777
Full immunity.

43:34.778 --> 43:37.740
Witness protection with the highest
reimbursement we've ever offered.

43:38.949 --> 43:40.784
Guarantee for Mimi's protection.

43:43.078 --> 43:45.706
Gonna throw in a couple cartons
of Mexican Marlboros every month.

43:50.502 --> 43:52.046
You sign these papers,

43:53.255 --> 43:55.007
I walk you out that door.

43:55.090 --> 43:56.425
We cross the river.

43:57.092 --> 43:58.010
We get in my car.

43:58.761 --> 44:00.929
And you and Mimi start a new life
in the US.

44:01.013 --> 44:03.849
And this night was
one big bad fucking dream.

44:10.606 --> 44:12.900
They're going to shoot me
the second I walk out that door.

44:12.983 --> 44:14.568
Not with me standing in front of you.

44:16.403 --> 44:19.031
In Mexico, these assholes are in charge.

44:19.114 --> 44:22.826
Once we get you across that river,
you're in my custody. You're safe.

44:23.285 --> 44:25.621
You'd do that? Stand in front of me?

44:26.538 --> 44:28.123
I walked in here, didn't I?

44:29.500 --> 44:30.959
Mimi told me your plan.

44:36.715 --> 44:38.258
She okay?

44:38.342 --> 44:40.052
Yeah. She's safe.

44:40.803 --> 44:42.012
At the church.

44:44.640 --> 44:46.183
She's waiting for you.

44:47.976 --> 44:51.980
I imagine still trying to figure out
how much of what you told her is bullshit.

44:52.564 --> 44:53.982
And so am I.

44:56.860 --> 44:59.113
I spoke with the reporter Poppa.

44:59.196 --> 45:01.156
There's no more articles coming.

45:01.615 --> 45:03.283
You've said all you were gonna say.

45:04.702 --> 45:06.578
I'm not a fucking snitch.

45:07.788 --> 45:09.832
I figured that's why
I never heard from you.

45:10.874 --> 45:13.460
It's also why I didn't just risk my life
trying to get you to sign

45:13.544 --> 45:14.670
some fucking plea deal.

45:16.296 --> 45:19.425
The reporter also told me about
that roof you built on the school here.

45:19.508 --> 45:22.219
The little girl whose eye surgery
you paid for.

45:22.761 --> 45:24.263
All your good deeds, man.

45:24.972 --> 45:26.557
You're not a bad guy.

45:28.434 --> 45:30.102
What's it matter now?

45:35.441 --> 45:37.484
Mimi's pregnant, Pablo.

45:45.909 --> 45:47.911
I swore up and down I wouldn't tell you.

45:47.995 --> 45:49.788
But you deserve to know.

45:54.376 --> 45:56.003
The world's a fucked up place, man.

45:58.672 --> 45:59.757
Code or no code.

46:01.675 --> 46:03.635
But I'm telling you,
you going out there and dying,

46:03.719 --> 46:05.012
that ain't gonna change anything.

46:06.430 --> 46:08.807
And yes, I want you to talk.

46:10.267 --> 46:12.186
But it's not about that anymore, man.

46:13.729 --> 46:15.189
You sign those papers,

46:15.981 --> 46:17.983
you can still be
with your girl and your kid.

46:21.945 --> 46:23.280
Pablo.

46:24.031 --> 46:25.699
Do it for your fucking kid, man.

46:32.790 --> 46:35.292
Don't shoot! Coming out!

46:35.375 --> 46:37.044
Keep your guns up!

46:49.473 --> 46:51.016
That's far enough.

46:52.601 --> 46:54.686
What the fuck do you think
you're doing, Walt?

46:54.770 --> 46:58.899
I told you,
I'm getting him across the river.

46:58.982 --> 47:00.526
You are on Mexican soil.

47:01.443 --> 47:02.444
You stand down.

47:02.528 --> 47:04.404
What are you gonna do? Shoot me?

47:10.536 --> 47:12.663
Add a zero right there, please.

47:15.666 --> 47:17.709
Get out!

47:25.968 --> 47:27.010
Add a zero to PRI.

47:37.896 --> 47:39.314
Go on.

47:39.982 --> 47:41.066
Shoot me.

47:42.943 --> 47:44.987
Get to the river, Pablo, and we're good.

47:46.029 --> 47:48.365
Let's go.

47:51.368 --> 47:52.452
Cover him!

47:57.791 --> 47:59.126
Maintain your positions!

48:02.504 --> 48:03.755
So what?

48:10.679 --> 48:12.014
Pablo, what are you doing?

48:16.768 --> 48:18.228
Tell her I'm sorry.

48:18.937 --> 48:20.063
What? No.

48:21.231 --> 48:22.065
What? No.

48:23.150 --> 48:24.109
Get down, Walt.

48:24.192 --> 48:25.235
Pablo, no.

48:26.403 --> 48:27.905
-Get down. Now!
-No.

48:41.710 --> 48:43.462
You got one thing right, Breslin.

48:44.046 --> 48:45.589
Guy was hard as they come.

48:47.382 --> 48:49.217
Ran like a fucking bull.

49:09.363 --> 49:11.114
What the hell did you think would happen?

49:12.074 --> 49:14.076
You'd get him out with 30 cops
standing around?

49:14.159 --> 49:16.203
I got pretty fucking close, didn't I?

49:16.912 --> 49:19.790
Like it would matter.
They would never let him talk.

49:19.873 --> 49:22.668
You know all that shit you said
about what Félix did to you?

49:24.878 --> 49:27.881
You're more interested in protecting
those assholes in Mexico City.

49:30.217 --> 49:32.177
You really think it's that simple, huh?

49:35.138 --> 49:38.934
You, Camarena, and these FBI idiots,
you're all the fucking same.

49:39.017 --> 49:40.352
-Oh, yeah?
-Yeah.

49:41.687 --> 49:43.313
You think you can come down here
and fix it

49:43.397 --> 49:45.148
'cause you got balls
and some fancy paperwork,

49:45.232 --> 49:47.234
but you have no clue
what you're up against.

49:48.944 --> 49:50.946
Why you're always getting people killed.

49:51.780 --> 49:52.823
That a threat?

49:53.573 --> 49:54.783
It's a warning.

49:55.867 --> 49:58.704
Just take a look at how your little plan
went down here, Walt.

50:01.456 --> 50:03.208
You should quit while you're ahead.

50:03.709 --> 50:05.502
Yeah, well, I got a couple days off.

50:07.087 --> 50:09.464
Maybe I'll head back up to Houston
and do some fishing.

50:10.882 --> 50:12.217
You're a smart man.

50:13.010 --> 50:15.470
Maybe you'll catch more there
than you ever will here.

50:18.807 --> 50:19.975
Goodbye, Walt.

50:23.437 --> 50:25.147
<i>Acosta's dead.</i>

50:26.106 --> 50:28.233
Happened about a half hour ago.

50:29.317 --> 50:30.902
<i>Thought you'd want to know.</i>

50:48.211 --> 50:50.338
<i>They put Pablo's body on ice...</i>

50:52.549 --> 50:54.760
<i>flew him in the chopper</i>
<i>back to the church...</i>

50:57.179 --> 50:59.639
<i>where the townspeople honored him</i>
<i>one last time...</i>

51:00.766 --> 51:03.602
<i>and then carried him to a cemetery</i>
<i>on the hill</i>

51:03.685 --> 51:05.771
<i>where a thousand more people were waiting.</i>

51:07.898 --> 51:09.399
<i>At about the same time,</i>

51:09.483 --> 51:13.028
<i>Mexico's most corrupt and controversial</i>
<i>election was coming to an end.</i>

51:14.321 --> 51:16.990
<i>What they did was so goddamn brazen.</i>

51:17.074 --> 51:20.368
<i>Adding a fucking zero to the tally sheets</i>
<i>gave them thousands of extra votes</i>

51:20.452 --> 51:21.661
<i>with a stroke of a pen.</i>

51:21.745 --> 51:24.122
<i>Immediately, there were protests</i>
<i>and hearings.</i>

51:24.206 --> 51:26.458
<i>Years later,</i>
<i>even former President de la Madrid</i>

51:26.541 --> 51:28.668
<i>would admit that there had been fraud.</i>

51:28.752 --> 51:32.089
<i>But then it was impossible to prove</i>
<i>because they had burned all the ballots.</i>

51:32.172 --> 51:35.175
<i>And the one man who could've</i>
<i>done something about it...</i>

51:35.258 --> 51:36.760
<i>wound up dead.</i>

51:37.385 --> 51:41.056
<i>So the fraud hadn't gone away...</i>
<i>just changed its stripes.</i>

51:41.932 --> 51:44.601
<i>Less predictable, more evil.</i>

51:45.936 --> 51:48.522
<i>Because history's got a way</i>
<i>of finding just the right assholes</i>

51:48.605 --> 51:50.190
<i>to shake things up.</i>

51:50.273 --> 51:52.234
Well done, Félix.

51:52.317 --> 51:54.528
<i>Guys who can take</i>
<i>a robbery designed to go down</i>

51:54.611 --> 51:55.737
<i>under the cover of darkness</i>

51:56.696 --> 51:59.116
<i>and pull it off in broad fucking daylight.</i>

52:14.965 --> 52:17.217
There weren't no more articles,
were there?

52:20.470 --> 52:21.763
No.

52:53.503 --> 52:55.088
How far along?

52:58.842 --> 53:00.093
Ten weeks.

53:02.429 --> 53:03.722
It's gonna be a boy.

53:18.904 --> 53:21.531
PRI WINS

53:27.621 --> 53:29.706
Looks like we don't have
to go into hiding.

53:30.916 --> 53:34.085
Hiding? We won.

53:36.755 --> 53:38.256
Join me.

53:38.340 --> 53:39.883
I'll buy you a coffee.

53:45.764 --> 53:49.184
Listen, no more delusions of grandeur.

53:51.144 --> 53:53.563
I deal with what's in front of me.

53:53.647 --> 53:55.106
And what's that?

53:57.025 --> 54:00.195
Well, keeping my organization healthy.

54:01.655 --> 54:03.281
My people happy.

54:06.409 --> 54:07.535
You.

54:09.246 --> 54:10.455
The kids.

54:11.081 --> 54:12.332
Mm-hmm.

54:13.667 --> 54:15.293
I'll believe it when I see it.

54:20.632 --> 54:23.134
Fair enough.

54:26.388 --> 54:28.807
In the meantime,
I'll take that coffee.

54:32.269 --> 54:35.063
Óscar, a coffee for the lady.

54:35.146 --> 54:36.273
Right away, sir.

54:36.815 --> 54:37.899
With milk.
