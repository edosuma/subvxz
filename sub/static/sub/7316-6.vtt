WEBVTT

00:05.652 --> 00:08.260
Harry Potter is not stupid.

00:08.304 --> 00:11.260
You've been Harry Potter for
the last three Halloweens.

00:11.304 --> 00:14.347
At least you could be a girl,
like Hermione or Ginny.

00:14.391 --> 00:16.565
You muggles
just don't get it.

00:16.608 --> 00:18.217
Uh, I do.

00:18.260 --> 00:19.739
It's stupid.

00:19.782 --> 00:21.086
Benjamin, enough.

00:21.130 --> 00:24.043
Rachel, your
costume's great.

00:24.086 --> 00:26.869
Thanks, Mr. Curtis.

00:26.913 --> 00:29.173
Is your mom chaperoning
the school party?

00:29.217 --> 00:31.739
No, she has to work.

00:31.782 --> 00:33.565
Oh, we'd be happy
to give you a ride.

00:33.608 --> 00:34.913
Isn't that right, Benjamin?

00:34.956 --> 00:35.782
Ugh!

00:36.826 --> 00:38.782
Thanks for walking me home.

00:38.826 --> 00:40.304
It's not a problem.
We'll see you tomorrow.

00:40.347 --> 00:41.869
Okay, bye, guys.

00:44.173 --> 00:46.565
Your manners leave something
to be desired, young man.

00:46.608 --> 00:47.652
When we get home...

00:47.695 --> 00:48.782
[Rachel screams]

00:48.826 --> 00:50.086
Wait here.

00:50.130 --> 00:52.130
Rachel.

00:54.565 --> 00:56.391
Rachel, what happened?

00:56.434 --> 00:58.347
Mom.

01:01.000 --> 01:02.347
Oh, my God.

01:35.565 --> 01:37.043
BISHOP: Come on,
be serious.

01:37.086 --> 01:38.304
McGEE: Hey, I have never
been more serious.

01:38.347 --> 01:39.173
There is no room
for error, Bishop.

01:39.217 --> 01:40.869
Hey!Listen to me.

01:40.913 --> 01:42.739
Hey, hey, hey!
Holyfield, Tyson--

01:42.782 --> 01:44.608
let's knock it off before
someone loses an ear.

01:44.652 --> 01:48.043
I was just talking about
Abby's upcoming Halloween party,

01:48.086 --> 01:50.217
when McGee went
all Bruce Banner on me.

01:50.260 --> 01:52.086
Yeah, for good reason-- she
doesn't want to wear a costume.

01:52.130 --> 01:53.869
What? Are you insane?

01:53.913 --> 01:56.521
God, for the love of all
that is holy, probie,

01:56.565 --> 01:58.086
let's get with
the program.

01:58.130 --> 02:00.434
Abby takes this
holiday very seriously.

02:00.478 --> 02:03.304
You deviate from the plan,
you pay the consequences.

02:03.347 --> 02:04.304
Tell her, McGee.

02:04.347 --> 02:06.086
Halloween, 2007,

02:06.130 --> 02:07.826
I told Abby I didn't want
to carve a pumpkin.

02:07.869 --> 02:09.434
He's still waiting
for the other one to descend.

02:11.304 --> 02:15.260
It's not that I don't want
to dress up, okay? It's...

02:15.304 --> 02:18.347
It's just that Jake and I
can't agree on a costume.

02:18.391 --> 02:20.173
[groans]
Marriage. Here we go.

02:20.217 --> 02:21.869
Halloween used to be

02:21.913 --> 02:23.086
a single guy's paradise.

02:23.130 --> 02:24.695
Now it's been
twisted and co-opted

02:24.739 --> 02:27.217
into some kind
of couples' thing.

02:27.260 --> 02:28.956
You're gonna be phoning it in
with Delilah.

02:29.000 --> 02:30.304
You've got your other half.

02:30.347 --> 02:32.173
Abby's got Ranger Burt.

02:32.217 --> 02:33.826
Even Ducky's got
something cooking.

02:33.869 --> 02:35.043
Why don't you take Allison?

02:35.086 --> 02:36.478
Allison.

02:36.521 --> 02:38.260
From tech services.

02:38.304 --> 02:40.086
Who you went out with
last week.

02:40.130 --> 02:41.130
Oh!
[laughs]

02:41.173 --> 02:43.826
[snorts]
Well, that didn't compute.

02:43.869 --> 02:46.217
That's, like, the sixth woman
you've dated this month.

02:46.260 --> 02:47.913
Yeah, that's a record,
even for you.

02:47.956 --> 02:49.608
Thank you. I'm back, baby.

02:49.652 --> 02:51.782
Gear up. We got
a dead body in Lake Ridge.

02:54.086 --> 02:55.782
Whatever happened
to Krista in HR?

02:55.826 --> 02:57.130
TONY:
Ugh, too judgmental.

02:57.173 --> 02:59.043
She never laughed
at the e-mails I sent her.

02:59.086 --> 03:00.217
That's 'cause they
were offensive.

03:00.260 --> 03:01.260
See? Too judgmental.

03:01.304 --> 03:03.043
And what about Erica
from accounting?

03:03.086 --> 03:04.043
What went wrong there?

03:04.086 --> 03:05.217
Cats. Too many cats.

03:05.260 --> 03:06.695
They were all
named Mr. Darcy.

03:06.739 --> 03:09.173
[sighs] Don't you think
you're being a little picky?

03:09.217 --> 03:11.260
Well, there's a lot
of fish in the sea.

03:11.304 --> 03:13.000
Not at the rate
you've been fishing.

03:13.043 --> 03:14.173
What can I say, McGee?

03:14.217 --> 03:17.086
Women find me alluring.

03:19.043 --> 03:20.478
What can you
tell me, Duck?

03:20.521 --> 03:23.043
Single gunshot wound
to the back.

03:23.086 --> 03:24.478
You got a time
of death?

03:24.521 --> 03:27.652
Yeah, between midnight
and 2:00 a.m. this morning.

03:27.695 --> 03:28.782
We searched the area, boss.

03:28.826 --> 03:30.043
No sign of a murder weapon.

03:30.086 --> 03:31.347
McGEE: And no
forced entry.

03:31.391 --> 03:32.913
Local LEOs found
the back door open

03:32.956 --> 03:34.086
when they arrived
on the scene.

03:34.130 --> 03:35.304
Place wasn't tossed.

03:35.347 --> 03:36.695
Doesn't look like
a robbery gone bad.

03:36.739 --> 03:37.782
Who's our victim?

03:37.826 --> 03:39.304
Victim is Dr. Valerie Barnes.

03:39.347 --> 03:41.782
42, wife of Navy Commander
Ryan Barnes.

03:41.826 --> 03:44.000
He's stationed at Little Creek.He found the body?

03:44.043 --> 03:46.869
No, that was Rachel Barnes,
victim's ten-year-old daughter,

03:46.913 --> 03:48.608
when she returned home
from a sleepover.

03:48.652 --> 03:49.869
A neighbor called it in.

03:49.913 --> 03:51.391
Well, where is she now?Outside.

03:51.434 --> 03:54.695
DiNozzo, track down the husband.
McGee, the neighbor.

03:56.347 --> 03:58.347
McGEE:
When was the last time

03:58.391 --> 04:00.043
you spoke to Mrs. Barnes?

04:00.086 --> 04:01.652
Last night,
around 6:00,

04:01.695 --> 04:03.347
when she dropped
off Rachel.

04:03.391 --> 04:05.086
She had to work late,
and I offered to babysit.

04:05.130 --> 04:06.434
You're friends
with the victim?

04:06.478 --> 04:08.130
Yeah, I've known Val
for three years.

04:08.173 --> 04:09.956
Our kids are in the same grade.

04:10.000 --> 04:11.478
Anything you can tell us
about the commander?

04:11.521 --> 04:14.347
Honestly,
I-I don't know him very well.

04:14.391 --> 04:16.173
He's not often around.

04:16.217 --> 04:17.521
He's either training
or on a mission.

04:17.565 --> 04:19.086
He left for one a few days ago,

04:19.130 --> 04:21.217
and that was
the last time I saw him.

04:22.173 --> 04:24.173
Can I take my
son home now?

04:24.217 --> 04:25.304
Of course.

04:25.347 --> 04:26.695
Yes.

04:26.739 --> 04:28.434
And, uh, thank you
for your help, Mr. Curtis.

04:28.478 --> 04:30.304
What's gonna happen to Rachel?

04:39.173 --> 04:40.173
Hi, Rachel.

04:42.521 --> 04:44.521
I'm Special Agent Gibbs.

04:46.782 --> 04:48.565
This is one
good-looking fort.

04:50.478 --> 04:52.565
You build this all by yourself?

04:57.956 --> 04:59.434
No.

04:59.478 --> 05:01.347
My dad helped me.

05:03.869 --> 05:06.043
Sounds like a pretty cool dad.

05:11.043 --> 05:13.000
Did you find him?

05:14.260 --> 05:16.130
Is he coming home?

05:16.173 --> 05:17.782
Don't worry.

05:17.826 --> 05:20.608
We will figure it out.

05:20.652 --> 05:21.826
Please don't make me leave.

05:23.304 --> 05:24.608
This is my safe place.

05:24.652 --> 05:26.304
Nothing bad will happen
to me in here.

05:26.347 --> 05:28.608
If they come back,
they can't hurt me.

05:28.652 --> 05:31.391
Who's "they," Rachel?

05:34.869 --> 05:37.260
The people trying
to kill my dad.

05:46.043 --> 05:47.913
BISHOP: Okay, which
costume do you

05:47.956 --> 05:49.260
like better for me and Jake?

05:49.304 --> 05:50.608
Popeye and Olive Oyl,

05:50.652 --> 05:53.869
or the old farming couple
from American Gothic.

05:53.913 --> 05:55.217
[sighs]
Neither.

05:55.260 --> 05:56.913
Bishop, this is a chance
for you to be

05:56.956 --> 05:58.086
whoever you want
for one night.

05:58.130 --> 05:59.434
So, why don't you get crazy?

05:59.478 --> 06:01.217
Step out of
your preppy librarian,

06:01.260 --> 06:03.217
hot-for-teacher comfort zone.

06:03.260 --> 06:05.347
Hey.What are your other ideas?

06:07.391 --> 06:09.521
I don't want to say.

06:09.565 --> 06:12.304
Romeo and Juliet.Cinderella and Prince Charming.

06:12.347 --> 06:14.130
Antony and Cleopatra.Bonnie and Clyde.

06:14.173 --> 06:15.782
How close are we?

06:17.652 --> 06:19.739
Smart choice.

06:19.782 --> 06:21.695
Incoming.Let's go. Give me an update.

06:21.739 --> 06:23.739
Ooh! Our victim is
Dr. Valerie Barnes,

06:23.782 --> 06:26.608
a therapist at a counseling
center in Richmond.

06:26.652 --> 06:28.521
I talked to her coworkers.

06:28.565 --> 06:30.695
They weren't aware of anyone
Valerie was having issues with,

06:30.739 --> 06:32.043
patients or otherwise.

06:32.086 --> 06:33.478
I want her case files.
What about the husband?

06:33.521 --> 06:35.043
Well, Commander Ryan Barnes is

06:35.086 --> 06:36.652
a highly decorated Navy SEAL

06:36.695 --> 06:38.086
with over 30 missions
under his belt.

06:38.130 --> 06:39.608
He's been off the grid
for survival training,

06:39.652 --> 06:41.521
but I sent word
to him in the field.

06:41.565 --> 06:43.043
He should be here
in a few hours.

06:43.086 --> 06:44.739
BISHOP: Rachel said people
were after her father.

06:44.782 --> 06:46.521
If the commander's in danger,
isn't being surrounded

06:46.565 --> 06:48.347
by a SEAL team
the safest place for him?

06:48.391 --> 06:49.521
TONY: Well,
we don't even know

06:49.565 --> 06:50.695
if he's being targeted.

06:50.739 --> 06:52.478
Yes, we do. Last year,
Commander Barnes

06:52.521 --> 06:54.826
took part
in Operation Lower Merion.

06:54.869 --> 06:56.695
The capture
of Benham Parsa.

06:56.739 --> 06:58.652
McGEE: Month after the raid,
the SEALs' identities

06:58.695 --> 06:59.869
were accidentally leaked,
including Barnes'.

06:59.913 --> 07:01.782
I did an online search,
came up with this.

07:03.043 --> 07:05.434
TONY: I get the feeling
that's not a dating profile.

07:05.478 --> 07:06.826
That was a terrorist Web site.

07:06.869 --> 07:09.347
Commander's on a jihad hit list.

07:09.391 --> 07:10.695
McGee, I want everything
on this site.

07:10.739 --> 07:12.782
Who made it,
who uploaded the photo.

07:12.826 --> 07:14.565
Anyone who's accessed it.

07:14.608 --> 07:15.652
I can help, too.

07:15.695 --> 07:16.869
Where's Rachel?

07:16.913 --> 07:18.043
In the conference room

07:18.086 --> 07:19.434
with the woman
from Social Services.

07:19.478 --> 07:22.391
Find me something,
DiNozzo.

07:23.869 --> 07:26.608
[goofy laughter playing
over toy's speaker]

07:26.652 --> 07:28.391
Uh...

07:28.434 --> 07:30.043
Love what you've done
with your lab, Abby.

07:30.086 --> 07:32.347
Thank you. Wait till you
see my apartment.

07:32.391 --> 07:34.956
It's my pièce
de résistance.

07:35.000 --> 07:37.391
I'm coming up empty-handed here.
Are you guys finding anything?

07:37.434 --> 07:39.260
Yeah, we were able to track down
the third-party host

07:39.304 --> 07:40.391
for the Web site.

07:40.434 --> 07:42.347
It's a company
based in Algeria.

07:42.391 --> 07:43.565
BISHOP:
Which means they won't

07:43.608 --> 07:45.652
turn over their client data
to the U.S.

07:45.695 --> 07:48.695
True, but we managed
to access the mainframe.

07:48.739 --> 07:51.652
The original coding that
was sent to the host

07:51.695 --> 07:55.043
came from an IP address in
Silver Spring, Maryland.

07:55.086 --> 07:57.652
Meet our sinister Web master.

07:58.478 --> 08:00.695
Dorian Hobart.

08:00.739 --> 08:02.260
McGEE: After his
dishonorable discharge

08:02.304 --> 08:04.565
from the Army in 2007,
Hobart became involved

08:04.608 --> 08:07.217
in several antigovernment
extremist groups.

08:07.260 --> 08:09.391
He hops from one broadband
to the other

08:09.434 --> 08:10.826
every time he logs on.

08:10.869 --> 08:12.652
Now, we know who he is;
we just don't know where.

08:12.695 --> 08:14.826
The site has
a message board, right?

08:14.869 --> 08:16.913
Let's use it.

08:16.956 --> 08:19.434
Yeah, we build a cover,
pose as an interested group.

08:19.478 --> 08:22.434
We set up the meet with Hobart,
and then we nail him.

08:22.478 --> 08:24.608
Your cover background has
to catch Hobart's attention.

08:24.652 --> 08:26.260
Okay.

08:26.304 --> 08:28.869
Okay, I'm Dylan Evans,
former Marine sniper.

08:28.913 --> 08:30.521
Dishonorably
discharged,

08:30.565 --> 08:32.130
I now work as
a mercenary for hire.

08:33.869 --> 08:35.521
Um...

08:35.565 --> 08:39.478
It kind of has to be a...
believable cover, McGee.

08:39.521 --> 08:42.565
And you could never
pull off a "Dylan."

08:42.608 --> 08:44.869
How about you be Stuart?

08:46.173 --> 08:47.478
Clarence.

08:47.521 --> 08:48.565
BISHOP:
No, we stick

08:48.608 --> 08:51.086
as close to the truth
as possible.

08:51.130 --> 08:52.913
Your name is Tim Walsh.

08:52.956 --> 08:55.173
You are an expert
in electronics,

08:55.217 --> 08:57.565
specializing in...

08:57.608 --> 08:59.565
detonators.

08:59.608 --> 09:02.304
Okay, let's hook a line
and catch a terrorist,

09:02.347 --> 09:03.521
Tim Walsh.

09:03.565 --> 09:05.173
I could've pulled off "Dylan."

09:17.434 --> 09:18.565
It's just me, Rachel.

09:19.826 --> 09:21.826
Come on out.

09:29.304 --> 09:31.043
What's...

09:31.086 --> 09:32.695
what's that?

09:32.739 --> 09:34.739
Popcorn and hot chocolate.

09:42.608 --> 09:44.565
You don't look like
the hot chocolate type.

09:44.608 --> 09:46.391
Huh.

09:46.434 --> 09:49.434
My mom used to make the best cup
of hot chocolate ever.

09:51.434 --> 09:53.478
Little bit of cinnamon.

09:53.521 --> 09:55.521
Mm-mmm.

09:57.739 --> 09:59.391
Long time ago.

10:02.304 --> 10:03.652
Did she die, too?

10:03.695 --> 10:06.043
Mm-hmm.

10:06.086 --> 10:07.956
When I was just about your age.

10:10.043 --> 10:11.739
Not an easy thing to go through.

10:11.782 --> 10:14.043
I know you want
to be strong,

10:14.086 --> 10:15.652
but it's okay to be sad.

10:15.695 --> 10:16.956
I'm not sad.

10:17.000 --> 10:18.260
I'm angry.

10:18.304 --> 10:20.260
How could she let this happen?

10:20.304 --> 10:21.521
It's not your mom's fault.

10:21.565 --> 10:23.086
Yes, it is.

10:23.130 --> 10:24.521
Daddy trained us.

10:24.565 --> 10:27.565
We knew what to do
if the bad people ever came.

10:27.608 --> 10:30.652
Your dad tell you
who the bad guys are?

10:30.695 --> 10:33.347
No, he just told us
be on alert, and I was.

10:33.391 --> 10:35.130
I didn't see
anything suspicious.

10:35.173 --> 10:38.304
I swear, I did everything
that I was supposed to do.

10:38.347 --> 10:39.347
You did good.

10:43.217 --> 10:45.304
I want my dad, Agent Gibbs.

10:45.347 --> 10:46.391
He'll be here soon.

10:46.434 --> 10:47.652
Well, I-I don't
like it here.

10:47.695 --> 10:50.000
I need my safe place.

10:50.043 --> 10:51.304
Yeah, well...

10:51.347 --> 10:53.782
I kind of thought you might.

10:53.826 --> 10:56.260
What are you doing?

10:56.304 --> 10:58.173
I'm building a fort.

10:59.391 --> 11:02.608
Got all the essential
fort-building materials.

11:03.652 --> 11:05.739
We're gonna make
a new safe place.

11:05.782 --> 11:06.869
Together.

11:09.826 --> 11:12.521
Nothing bad is gonna
happen to you, Rachel.

11:13.869 --> 11:15.000
I promise.

11:15.043 --> 11:18.695
Do you keep your promises?

11:18.739 --> 11:19.826
Always.

11:23.652 --> 11:24.956
What's the verdict, Ducky?

11:25.000 --> 11:26.782
Death was
instantaneous.

11:26.826 --> 11:29.608
Bullet fragmented
on impact.

11:29.652 --> 11:32.608
Shooting someone unarmed in
the back is such a cowardly act.

11:32.652 --> 11:34.391
Robert Ford
comes to mind.

11:34.434 --> 11:36.000
I think we can
safely rule him out.

11:36.043 --> 11:37.000
Anything else?

11:37.043 --> 11:38.652
Indeed, something curious.

11:38.695 --> 11:39.695
Our victim suffered

11:39.739 --> 11:41.739
from an orbitozygomatic
fracture.

11:41.782 --> 11:44.695
That's the right
cheekbone and eye socket.

11:44.739 --> 11:46.217
From the fall?Oh, no, no, no, no.

11:46.260 --> 11:47.565
This is an old injury.

11:47.608 --> 11:49.260
At least ten years.

11:49.304 --> 11:52.695
But there's no record of it
in her medical history.

11:52.739 --> 11:54.130
That is curious.

11:55.782 --> 11:57.739
Eleanor, what a pleasure.

11:57.782 --> 11:59.608
Sorry, Ducky.
I'm here for Tony.

11:59.652 --> 12:00.608
Ah.

12:00.652 --> 12:01.913
Hobart took the bait.

12:01.956 --> 12:03.739
He set up a meeting
with McGee in two hours.

12:03.782 --> 12:05.043
Pinecrest Park.

12:05.086 --> 12:06.739
Oh. You know what that means.

12:07.695 --> 12:09.478
Undercover work.

12:09.521 --> 12:10.521
How's your plow position?

12:10.565 --> 12:12.565
My what?

12:12.608 --> 12:14.869
TONY:
Breathe in, arms up.

12:14.913 --> 12:16.826
Sun salutation.

12:16.869 --> 12:18.043
Hands together.

12:18.086 --> 12:20.043
Back to the chest.

12:20.086 --> 12:22.217
And then reach back
with your left foot.

12:22.260 --> 12:24.260
Arms out.

12:24.304 --> 12:26.043
Take your right hand,

12:26.086 --> 12:28.043
put it down
next to your right foot.

12:28.086 --> 12:29.652
Didn't know you practiced yoga.

12:29.695 --> 12:30.695
Oh, yeah.

12:30.739 --> 12:32.086
Balanced mind, balanced life.

12:32.130 --> 12:34.521
I've been reading
Sting's biography.

12:34.565 --> 12:35.956
He's a Renaissance man.

12:36.000 --> 12:37.826
Oh, please, I just ate.

12:38.913 --> 12:40.869
I reject your negative energy,
McGee.

12:42.869 --> 12:44.434
Bogey, DiNozzo.

12:44.478 --> 12:46.260
Your 10:00,
coming down the path.

12:46.304 --> 12:47.347
I got him.

12:50.000 --> 12:51.391
Back down to the weapon.

12:57.739 --> 12:59.173
You Tim?

12:59.217 --> 13:01.391
That's right.

13:01.434 --> 13:03.391
Where's the sample?

13:08.652 --> 13:09.739
Go, go, go.

13:11.565 --> 13:12.652
Hobart-- freeze, hands up.

13:16.217 --> 13:17.695
Drop the weapon!Ladies first.

13:17.739 --> 13:19.695
GIBBS:
NCIS.

13:19.739 --> 13:21.608
Put it down.

13:21.652 --> 13:23.391
TONY:
You okay, McGee?Yeah.

13:23.434 --> 13:25.826
Flo-Jo came
out of nowhere, Boss.

13:25.869 --> 13:27.956
Spider?

13:29.695 --> 13:31.000
Keates?

13:35.130 --> 13:37.565
You know her?Um...

13:37.608 --> 13:40.521
Uh... well, I...
in a... sort of...

13:40.565 --> 13:43.391
Yeah, she's Philly PD.

13:43.434 --> 13:44.652
KEATES:
She was.

13:44.695 --> 13:45.652
She's ATF now.

13:45.695 --> 13:46.913
Special Agent Zoe Keates.

13:46.956 --> 13:48.695
You want to get that gun
out of my face

13:48.739 --> 13:50.434
and come over here
and give me a hug?

13:50.478 --> 13:51.434
GIBBS:
Nobody moves

13:51.478 --> 13:52.608
until I get some answers.

13:52.652 --> 13:54.086
KEATES:
Okay.

13:54.130 --> 13:55.173
Why don't you start
by telling me

13:55.217 --> 13:56.826
what the hell
NCIS is doing here.

13:56.869 --> 13:59.521
We're here taking down
a terrorist.

13:59.565 --> 14:01.260
What the hell
are you doing here?

14:01.304 --> 14:03.043
I'm your terrorist.

14:12.782 --> 14:14.608
So, that's not
Dorian Hobart.

14:14.652 --> 14:16.956
That is Special Agent
Marston, our decoy.

14:17.000 --> 14:18.782
When ATF got wind
that Hobart was

14:18.826 --> 14:20.521
recruiting
explosives experts

14:20.565 --> 14:22.043
for a domestic terror group,

14:22.086 --> 14:23.260
I got assigned to
track him down.

14:23.304 --> 14:25.913
What's NCIS want him for?Murder.

14:25.956 --> 14:28.347
That's his wheelhouse.
Whose?

14:28.391 --> 14:30.043
Valerie Barnes,
wife of a Navy SEAL

14:30.086 --> 14:31.565
listed on his Web site.

14:31.608 --> 14:32.869
She was killed last night.

14:34.956 --> 14:36.521
Well, I'm sorry to hear that.

14:36.565 --> 14:38.043
But Hobart can't be your guy.

14:38.086 --> 14:39.913
We captured him
two months ago.

14:39.956 --> 14:41.043
We kept the
arrest under wraps

14:41.086 --> 14:43.000
in order to maintain
his online presence.

14:43.043 --> 14:45.000
Checked out any
potential threats.

14:45.043 --> 14:46.652
Why didn't you remove Commander
Barnes from the hit list?

14:46.695 --> 14:48.043
Well, we had to maintain
the site's authenticity.

14:48.086 --> 14:49.782
If there was any
indication that he

14:49.826 --> 14:51.695
or his family were in danger,
we would have stepped in.

14:51.739 --> 14:53.217
His wife's dead.

14:53.260 --> 14:55.000
Think you missed your cue.

14:55.043 --> 14:57.217
Okay, look here, John Wayne.

14:57.260 --> 14:58.565
You don't come
into my house

14:58.608 --> 15:00.608
and accuse me
of not doing my job.

15:00.652 --> 15:02.826
Okay, why don't we just
settle down, back it up.

15:02.869 --> 15:06.043
Like hell. I am damn
good at what I do.

15:06.086 --> 15:07.608
I'm also professional enough

15:07.652 --> 15:09.000
to admit when
I've made a mistake,

15:09.043 --> 15:11.869
but only when I've made one.

15:12.869 --> 15:15.347
Our victim was shot with a .38.

15:15.391 --> 15:17.869
Close range, single round,
at her residence.

15:17.913 --> 15:20.173
What does that tell you,
Special Agent Keates?

15:20.217 --> 15:23.043
It means it wasn't done
by an extremist group.

15:23.086 --> 15:25.608
Terrorists have a
flair for drama.

15:25.652 --> 15:28.521
It's not just about killing;
it's about sending a message.

15:32.304 --> 15:33.695
Look, your murder's too quiet.

15:33.739 --> 15:35.434
[cell phone ringing]

15:35.478 --> 15:36.913
I think you're
going down the wrong path.

15:38.695 --> 15:39.826
I agree.

15:39.869 --> 15:41.043
Gibbs.

15:41.086 --> 15:42.608
BISHOP:
Hey, McGee.

15:42.652 --> 15:44.043
How are the ribs?

15:44.086 --> 15:45.695
They feel like they've been
completely destroyed.

15:45.739 --> 15:47.521
Yeah, sorry about that.

15:47.565 --> 15:48.956
I thought you were
an explosives expert.

15:49.000 --> 15:50.565
I couldn't risk you
hitting the switch.

15:50.608 --> 15:53.608
And excessive force
always was your style.

15:55.695 --> 15:57.565
Yeah? You never
seemed to mind.

15:57.608 --> 15:59.478
I'm sorry, how do you two
know each other?

15:59.521 --> 16:01.043
We were rookies together
back in Philly.

16:01.086 --> 16:02.869
When did you work
in Philadelphia?

16:02.913 --> 16:04.869
I did a brief stint in Philly

16:04.913 --> 16:06.521
before I went to Baltimore.

16:06.565 --> 16:09.043
Commitment was never one
of Spider's strong suits.

16:09.086 --> 16:10.739
[laughs]Spider?

16:10.782 --> 16:13.434
That was the nickname
the guys in the squad gave Tony.

16:13.478 --> 16:15.000
You know, like
in Goodfellas?

16:15.043 --> 16:16.434
Except you had to do more

16:16.478 --> 16:18.434
than fetch drinks
and shine shoes, huh?

16:18.478 --> 16:20.652
And it's a wonder I didn't stay.

16:20.695 --> 16:23.782
No, you preferred
to tuck tail and run.

16:23.826 --> 16:25.826
[chuckles]

16:25.869 --> 16:27.478
Look at you,
same old biting wit.

16:27.521 --> 16:28.956
Nothing much has changed, huh?

16:29.000 --> 16:30.565
Why mess with perfection?

16:32.086 --> 16:33.652
Commander Barnes is
on his way in.

16:33.695 --> 16:35.695
Let's go.

16:40.000 --> 16:41.956
Hmm.

16:42.000 --> 16:44.043
That's a good look
on you, Keates.

16:58.652 --> 17:00.478
Sorry for your loss.

17:05.173 --> 17:07.000
[bangs table]

17:17.043 --> 17:19.608
You know, I always knew my
job could cost me my life.

17:19.652 --> 17:21.652
I prepared for that.

17:23.043 --> 17:25.000
I never thought it'd
put my family in danger.

17:29.000 --> 17:30.956
We don't know that it did.

17:31.000 --> 17:32.956
The two might not be connected.

17:33.000 --> 17:35.521
Wait, a-are you saying
that somebody...

17:35.565 --> 17:37.000
purposely targeted my wife?

17:37.043 --> 17:40.043
Think it's possible.

17:40.086 --> 17:42.869
You know anyone she might
have had problems with?

17:42.913 --> 17:44.608
No.

17:44.652 --> 17:46.043
Nobody I'm aware of.

17:46.086 --> 17:48.043
What about changes
in her behavior?

17:48.086 --> 17:50.086
Changes? I don't know.

17:50.130 --> 17:52.913
I... I'm gone ten months
out of the year.

17:52.956 --> 17:56.043
That makes me a damn good SEAL
but not the best husband.

17:56.086 --> 17:57.608
Or father.

17:59.173 --> 18:02.130
You better catch whoever
did this, Agent Gibbs.

18:02.173 --> 18:04.260
Find him before I do.

18:04.304 --> 18:05.782
Commander, the only thing

18:05.826 --> 18:08.130
that you should be focusing on
is your daughter.

18:08.173 --> 18:09.608
You let us handle the rest.

18:11.217 --> 18:13.739
You're right.

18:13.782 --> 18:14.739
[clears throat]

18:14.782 --> 18:16.434
Can I see her now?

18:17.913 --> 18:19.521
Sure.

18:24.217 --> 18:25.173
Abby, you rang?

18:25.217 --> 18:26.478
I did. Think fast.

18:26.521 --> 18:27.434
Oh.

18:27.478 --> 18:29.173
It's an aromatherapy
heating pad.

18:29.217 --> 18:30.478
I heard that Tony's...

18:30.521 --> 18:32.782
blast from the past
took you down kind of hard.

18:34.782 --> 18:36.695
What?
She asked for an update.

18:38.565 --> 18:40.391
What's with
the dummies?

18:40.434 --> 18:43.000
Oh, it's Tony
and Special Agent Keates.

18:43.043 --> 18:45.260
I was setting
the scene for Abby.

18:45.304 --> 18:47.391
Body position is
a universal language.

18:47.434 --> 18:50.913
And from what
I've been looking at,

18:50.956 --> 18:52.869
these two have some
serious history.

18:52.913 --> 18:56.217
Yeah, from a firsthand account,
there was a definite spark.

18:56.260 --> 18:57.478
Thoughts?

18:58.565 --> 19:00.913
Well, Tony never
mentioned her before.

19:00.956 --> 19:02.869
But Bishop's right--
I've never seen him

19:02.913 --> 19:05.130
act like that
around someone since...

19:06.086 --> 19:07.739
What?

19:07.782 --> 19:09.826
BOTH:
It's complicated.

19:09.869 --> 19:12.043
Oh.

19:12.086 --> 19:15.043
Well, Tony's clearly trying
to fill some void.

19:15.086 --> 19:17.347
Maybe she's exactly
what he needs.

19:17.391 --> 19:18.739
Someone familiar.

19:18.782 --> 19:20.956
I don't think a nice little push

19:21.000 --> 19:22.652
in the right direction
would hurt.

19:22.695 --> 19:23.826
I'm in.

19:23.869 --> 19:25.521
McGee?

19:25.565 --> 19:27.391
If I say yes, you promise
to change the subject?

19:27.434 --> 19:28.521
Yes.Yes.

19:28.565 --> 19:29.521
Exhibit A--

19:29.565 --> 19:31.652
our lone bullet.

19:31.695 --> 19:32.956
McGEE:
What happened to it?

19:33.000 --> 19:34.521
ABBY:
It's degraded ammunition.

19:34.565 --> 19:36.130
It happens when it
isn't stored properly.

19:36.173 --> 19:38.130
Once I catalog the pieces
from our crime scene

19:38.173 --> 19:39.608
and from our victim,

19:39.652 --> 19:42.434
I'll be able to make
a 3-D image of our bullet.

19:42.478 --> 19:44.652
Sort of a ballistics
jigsaw puzzle.

19:44.695 --> 19:46.608
And if there's a bullet
in the system that matches,

19:46.652 --> 19:48.130
then we'll be closer

19:48.173 --> 19:50.347
to identifying our shooter.

19:50.391 --> 19:53.434
Don't you just love science?

19:53.478 --> 19:55.652
So, how long till we can
go back to the house?

19:55.695 --> 19:57.478
At least a few days.

19:57.521 --> 19:59.652
We'll be staying at
the Admiral Heights Hotel.

19:59.695 --> 20:02.043
Could you let me know
if there's any news?

20:02.086 --> 20:04.347
You're sure you don't want
to take that fort with you?

20:04.391 --> 20:05.521
No.

20:05.565 --> 20:07.043
I have my dad.

20:07.086 --> 20:08.173
That's all I need.

20:09.347 --> 20:11.260
Can't thank you enough
for keeping her safe.

20:18.521 --> 20:20.130
Promise is a promise.

20:26.478 --> 20:28.260
All right, boss,
I did some digging.

20:28.304 --> 20:30.869
The old facial fracture
Ducky discovered

20:30.913 --> 20:33.608
during Valerie Barnes'
autopsy was the work

20:33.652 --> 20:35.521
of none other
than George Burton.

20:35.565 --> 20:37.478
The serial killer?That's right.

20:37.521 --> 20:39.478
Don't forget
"enthusiastic cannibal."

20:39.521 --> 20:40.826
This guy's crime scene
photos would make

20:40.869 --> 20:43.043
Hannibal Lecter shake
in his straitjacket.

20:43.086 --> 20:44.478
What's the connection?

20:44.521 --> 20:46.478
Well, in 1999,

20:46.521 --> 20:49.478
Valerie worked as a forensic
psychiatrist in Maryland,

20:49.521 --> 20:51.565
and Burton was an inmate.

20:51.608 --> 20:54.565
He got loose during his
pretrial evaluation,

20:54.608 --> 20:56.521
and, well, it was a close call.

20:56.565 --> 20:58.739
Where is George
Burton now?

20:58.782 --> 21:00.391
Serving a life sentence

21:00.434 --> 21:02.565
at Eastern State
Psychiatric Hospital.

21:02.608 --> 21:05.347
Well, DiNozzo,
you just gave him his alibi.

21:05.391 --> 21:07.391
Well, Valerie cut off
all contact with Burton

21:07.434 --> 21:09.695
after the attack
until two weeks ago.

21:09.739 --> 21:12.521
Hospital confirmed
she paid him a visit

21:12.565 --> 21:13.652
behind closed doors.

21:31.826 --> 21:35.217
Well, isn't this
a pleasant surprise.

21:35.260 --> 21:36.782
And, uh... and who might you be?

21:36.826 --> 21:39.173
I'm Very Special Agent
Anthony DiNozzo.

21:39.217 --> 21:42.086
I do love Italian.

21:42.130 --> 21:43.782
Okay.

21:43.826 --> 21:45.391
He's all yours, boss.

21:45.434 --> 21:47.086
Does, um...

21:47.130 --> 21:48.478
does the boss
have a name?

21:48.521 --> 21:51.173
Gibbs.

21:51.217 --> 21:52.782
NCIS.
Oh...

21:52.826 --> 21:55.391
That is disappointing.

21:55.434 --> 21:56.739
How did she die?

21:58.347 --> 21:59.565
We are

21:59.608 --> 22:02.043
talking about Valerie, right?

22:02.086 --> 22:03.434
Who said she's dead?

22:03.478 --> 22:06.043
Come on, I can see it
all over your faces.

22:06.086 --> 22:07.782
Uh, you're thinking

22:07.826 --> 22:10.434
that I probably have
something to do with it.

22:10.478 --> 22:13.000
Which is an understandable
assumption,

22:13.043 --> 22:15.260
except for
the glaringly obvious.

22:15.304 --> 22:18.260
TONY:
What we're thinking
is maybe you had one of

22:18.304 --> 22:20.434
your unbalanced pen pals
do the job for you.

22:20.478 --> 22:21.782
[laughs]

22:21.826 --> 22:23.086
You flatter me.

22:23.130 --> 22:24.782
I must have said it wrong.

22:24.826 --> 22:28.173
No, I-I wouldn't have, uh...

22:28.217 --> 22:30.043
I-I wouldn't,
I wouldn't hurt Valerie.

22:30.086 --> 22:32.521
She's one of the few
people I respected.

22:35.521 --> 22:38.521
GIBBS:
You have a funny way
of showing it.

22:38.565 --> 22:41.434
Well, that was an unfortunate
little incident.

22:41.478 --> 22:42.782
I, um...

22:42.826 --> 22:45.565
I thought that

22:45.608 --> 22:47.173
a little outburst would...

22:47.217 --> 22:48.652
would-would help
my insanity plea.

22:48.695 --> 22:50.130
But it wasn't
personal.

22:50.173 --> 22:52.478
I just...
Listen, if I wanted to kill her,

22:52.521 --> 22:53.782
I would have killed her.

22:53.826 --> 22:55.478
I... I did not want to kill her.

22:55.521 --> 22:57.478
Why is that?I told you. I respected her.

22:57.521 --> 23:00.913
Prove it.
Oh, what did you
have in mind, boss?

23:02.521 --> 23:03.434
Why'd Valerie come to see you?

23:03.478 --> 23:04.956
She had a issue with a...

23:05.000 --> 23:06.478
with a patient

23:06.521 --> 23:09.043
whose behavior was
a little bit like mine.

23:09.086 --> 23:09.913
Another killer?

23:09.956 --> 23:12.000
Oh, no.

23:12.043 --> 23:13.478
Much worse.

23:13.521 --> 23:14.434
Another sociopath.

23:14.478 --> 23:17.304
You do your homework,

23:17.347 --> 23:18.956
and I like that.

23:19.000 --> 23:19.869
What kind of behavior?

23:19.913 --> 23:21.565
[laughing]

23:22.956 --> 23:26.130
I mean, sociopaths,
we, um...

23:26.173 --> 23:28.043
we just... would do anything--

23:28.086 --> 23:30.782
lie, manipulate,

23:30.826 --> 23:32.565
anything--

23:32.608 --> 23:34.782
to get what we want.

23:34.826 --> 23:37.739
And anybody

23:37.782 --> 23:40.173
who gets in the way

23:40.217 --> 23:42.000
becomes an obstacle

23:42.043 --> 23:44.347
to be eliminated.

23:44.391 --> 23:46.434
How was Valerie an obstacle?

23:46.478 --> 23:48.739
[whispering]:
She went poking around
in the wrong head.

23:48.782 --> 23:50.434
When a dog turns

23:50.478 --> 23:52.173
on its owner,

23:52.217 --> 23:54.347
there's only one possible
course of action:

23:54.391 --> 23:56.695
You put the dog down.

23:58.391 --> 23:59.782
I ate mine.

24:04.086 --> 24:06.782
Childhood memories are
the sweetest, aren't they?

24:10.391 --> 24:11.391
What was her patient's name?

24:11.434 --> 24:13.478
She didn't tell me.

24:13.521 --> 24:15.173
But I do know

24:15.217 --> 24:17.434
that she was scared.

24:17.478 --> 24:20.434
Really, really scared.

24:20.478 --> 24:23.782
More scared than
she ever was with me.

24:34.826 --> 24:44.000
[snorts]

24:44.043 --> 24:44.956
Bishop.
Huh?

24:45.000 --> 24:45.782
No napping.

24:45.826 --> 24:47.260
McGee, we've
been over

24:47.304 --> 24:48.565
Valerie's patient
files for hours

24:48.608 --> 24:50.000
and haven't
found a thing.

24:50.043 --> 24:51.826
We're going
on the word

24:51.869 --> 24:53.739
of a convicted
murderer.

24:53.782 --> 24:55.478
It's not exactly
a reliable source.

24:55.521 --> 24:56.565
You'd be surprised.

24:56.608 --> 24:58.130
Some of my best informants

24:58.173 --> 25:00.086
are the worst scum imaginable.

25:00.130 --> 25:01.869
Figured you guys would
be working through the night.

25:01.913 --> 25:04.652
Brought you a little pick-me-up.

25:04.695 --> 25:06.782
And a peace
offering for you.

25:06.826 --> 25:08.956
Apple-bran muffin.

25:09.000 --> 25:11.478
Oh, thank you. That's my
favorite. How'd you know?

25:11.521 --> 25:13.695
Ah, you fit the type:
uptight but regular.

25:13.739 --> 25:14.739
Thanks.

25:14.782 --> 25:16.304
So I felt bad
about yesterday.

25:16.347 --> 25:18.043
I called some of my contacts,

25:18.086 --> 25:19.478
and they confirmed
my suspicions.

25:19.521 --> 25:21.260
There's been
no chatter

25:21.304 --> 25:23.173
amongst extremist groups
in regards to your victim.

25:23.217 --> 25:24.695
Well, thank you for the intel,
but we've actually

25:24.739 --> 25:26.260
been following up on a new lead.

25:26.304 --> 25:27.782
Yeah, our victim
was a psychiatrist,

25:27.826 --> 25:29.000
so we're looking
into her patients.

25:29.043 --> 25:30.521
Hmm.

25:30.565 --> 25:32.565
Killing to keep a dark secret.

25:32.608 --> 25:34.826
People have done so for less.

25:34.869 --> 25:37.043
I'm intrigued.

25:37.086 --> 25:38.652
What else you got?

25:38.695 --> 25:42.043
BISHOP:
Uh, we compiled a list
of all her patients

25:42.086 --> 25:43.608
and found only six that had

25:43.652 --> 25:46.260
any sort of history
of violent behavior.

25:46.304 --> 25:48.130
Assault, domestic violence,
schizophrenia,

25:48.173 --> 25:49.739
PTSD, anger management.

25:49.782 --> 25:51.826
Let me guess-- they all
have rock-solid alibis?

25:51.869 --> 25:54.130
Well, three of them are
at in-patient facilities,

25:54.173 --> 25:55.608
two have
ankle monitors,

25:55.652 --> 25:57.478
and one has been
out of the country.

25:57.521 --> 25:58.869
The most dangerous criminals

25:58.913 --> 26:00.608
are the ones you underestimate.

26:00.652 --> 26:02.608
I would focus in
on the patients

26:02.652 --> 26:04.260
that fly under the radar.

26:04.304 --> 26:05.608
The quietest mouse

26:05.652 --> 26:07.478
always gets the cheese.

26:07.521 --> 26:08.826
BISHOP:
I...

26:08.869 --> 26:10.043
don't think that's a saying.

26:10.086 --> 26:11.391
Gotta go.

26:11.434 --> 26:12.826
Good luck with the case.

26:12.869 --> 26:15.782
Uh... Agent Keates?

26:15.826 --> 26:17.826
I was just wondering--

26:17.869 --> 26:20.391
for no particular reason--

26:20.434 --> 26:22.956
what are your thoughts on
classic movie marathons

26:23.000 --> 26:25.000
and home-cooked
Italian meals?

26:27.869 --> 26:31.304
Well, I appreciate the offer...

26:32.913 --> 26:35.130
...but you're barking
up the wrong tree.

26:35.173 --> 26:36.869
No, no, no, I wasn't...

26:36.913 --> 26:38.304
I was just... I...

26:38.347 --> 26:39.869
McGEE:
Smooth.

26:45.695 --> 26:48.000
Hey, I got your 911 text.
What's going on?

26:56.391 --> 26:58.434
No matter what happens
in the next few minutes,

26:58.478 --> 27:01.260
just remember
that hug.

27:01.304 --> 27:02.739
Oh, boy.
What's up?

27:02.782 --> 27:04.913
We need to talk.
Yeah...

27:04.956 --> 27:06.695
Words I'm never
fond of hearing.

27:06.739 --> 27:08.608
Look, I know that
this past year has been

27:08.652 --> 27:10.695
hard for you.

27:10.739 --> 27:12.217
It's been hard
for all of us.

27:12.260 --> 27:14.260
But the thing is...
we've never talked about it.

27:14.304 --> 27:16.217
Not once.We don't have to.

27:16.260 --> 27:17.434
See? That's the problem.

27:17.478 --> 27:19.304
We do.

27:19.347 --> 27:20.652
I know you, Tony.

27:20.695 --> 27:21.826
The real you,

27:21.869 --> 27:23.695
and the fake-happy-

27:23.739 --> 27:25.565
front-you-put-up you.

27:25.608 --> 27:26.652
Now, come on.

27:26.695 --> 27:28.782
I... I am
a happy dude.

27:28.826 --> 27:30.956
I mean, I, like,
radiate happiness.

27:31.000 --> 27:32.565
That song,
"Happy," I...

27:35.434 --> 27:36.608
That's baloney.

27:36.652 --> 27:38.565
This whole random act

27:38.608 --> 27:40.826
of dating shtick?

27:40.869 --> 27:42.130
Nobody's buying it. Okay?

27:42.173 --> 27:43.782
We know you're lonely,

27:43.826 --> 27:45.652
and we know why.

27:45.695 --> 27:46.782
Ziva.

27:48.478 --> 27:49.782
Say it.

27:49.826 --> 27:51.173
Ziva.

27:51.217 --> 27:52.739
Come on, I can say it.

27:52.782 --> 27:53.826
I know her name.

27:56.869 --> 27:58.739
Ziva.

27:58.782 --> 28:01.695
Okay, then let's stop dancing
around this whole thing, okay?

28:01.739 --> 28:03.000
We all miss her.

28:03.043 --> 28:04.739
I love Ziva, but she left us.

28:04.782 --> 28:05.782
She is gone.

28:05.826 --> 28:07.782
And-and it hurts,

28:07.826 --> 28:09.217
and it sucks,

28:09.260 --> 28:12.173
but that's reality
and you have to face it.

28:12.217 --> 28:13.826
I have faced it.

28:13.869 --> 28:15.130
Many, many times.

28:15.173 --> 28:16.695
She said no.

28:16.739 --> 28:19.391
She didn't want to come back.

28:19.434 --> 28:21.434
That's that.

28:22.739 --> 28:24.565
I have moved on from it.

28:24.608 --> 28:27.304
But you haven't
moved on from her.

28:27.347 --> 28:29.782
And you can't keep
putting your life on hold

28:29.826 --> 28:31.826
waiting for her to show up,
because...

28:31.869 --> 28:33.521
she probably never will.

28:33.565 --> 28:35.826
I know.

28:35.869 --> 28:37.521
Doesn't make it any easier.

28:42.347 --> 28:44.260
The truth is

28:44.304 --> 28:45.826
I miss my friend.

28:45.869 --> 28:47.782
You have friends here,
too, Tony.

28:47.826 --> 28:49.043
Don't forget.

28:49.086 --> 28:51.260
I know.

28:51.304 --> 28:52.608
Thanks, Abby.

28:52.652 --> 28:54.086
ABBY:
Wait. Hold that thought.

28:56.086 --> 28:58.478
TONY:
Ballistics on
our bullet?

28:58.521 --> 28:59.869
Yeah, and it's juicy.

28:59.913 --> 29:02.695
The striation patterns
match a round

29:02.739 --> 29:05.260
from a Colt .38 Super
that was already in the system.

29:05.304 --> 29:06.260
From another murder?

29:06.304 --> 29:07.521
ABBY:
The police report says

29:07.565 --> 29:09.608
it was an accidental
firearms discharge

29:09.652 --> 29:11.304
at a private residence.

29:11.347 --> 29:13.695
No injuries reported,
no charges filed.

29:13.739 --> 29:14.695
Who's the gun registered to?

29:14.739 --> 29:16.826
ABBY:
Nathan Curtis.

29:16.869 --> 29:19.304
Oh... This is why
I don't trust my neighbors.

29:19.347 --> 29:20.652
NATHAN:
Are you insane?

29:20.695 --> 29:21.913
Valerie was my friend.

29:21.956 --> 29:23.000
I didn't kill her.

29:23.043 --> 29:24.608
Your Colt did.

29:24.652 --> 29:26.043
Ballistics
are a match.

29:26.086 --> 29:27.652
What?

29:27.695 --> 29:30.608
I haven't seen
that gun since I...

29:30.652 --> 29:33.217
Trust me, you want
to keep talking here.

29:38.086 --> 29:39.478
It was a year ago.

29:39.521 --> 29:40.826
I just left the corps,

29:40.869 --> 29:42.826
and I was having
trouble adjusting.

29:42.869 --> 29:46.652
I was in a really
dark place.

29:46.695 --> 29:50.217
Firearm discharge
wasn't an accident.

29:50.260 --> 29:52.260
No.

29:54.434 --> 29:55.913
[sighs]

29:55.956 --> 29:58.521
I tried to take my own life,
but the gun misfired.

30:00.652 --> 30:02.782
That's when I went
to Valerie for help.

30:02.826 --> 30:03.826
She was treating you?

30:05.000 --> 30:06.347
No, she couldn't,
because we were friends,

30:06.391 --> 30:08.304
but she set me up
with one of her colleagues.

30:08.347 --> 30:09.304
Where's the Colt?

30:09.347 --> 30:11.086
[sighs]

30:11.130 --> 30:12.695
After the incident,

30:12.739 --> 30:14.826
I didn't trust myself
with the gun in the house,

30:14.869 --> 30:16.217
so Val locked it up
in her husband's safe

30:16.260 --> 30:17.782
until I was ready
to have it back.

30:19.130 --> 30:21.739
Look, I swear,
I totally forgot about it.

30:21.782 --> 30:22.913
Hmm.

30:22.956 --> 30:24.782
Like you forgot
about that argument

30:24.826 --> 30:26.478
the two of you had last month?

30:26.521 --> 30:27.608
Witnesses
report

30:27.652 --> 30:28.913
a very heated exchange

30:28.956 --> 30:30.217
between you and Mrs. Barnes

30:30.260 --> 30:31.608
outside Rachel's school.

30:31.652 --> 30:33.913
People argue,
Agent McGee.

30:33.956 --> 30:35.782
It's not something
you kill over.

30:35.826 --> 30:37.086
Convince us.

30:41.739 --> 30:44.565
Look, something was going on
between Val and Ryan.

30:44.608 --> 30:46.826
She was on
the edge

30:46.869 --> 30:48.739
every time Ryan
was around Rachel.

30:48.782 --> 30:51.782
And when I saw bruises
on Rachel,

30:51.826 --> 30:53.869
I confronted Val.Why didn't you report it?

30:53.913 --> 30:56.086
Because she swore to me
I had it all wrong,

30:56.130 --> 30:57.478
that Ryan would
never hurt Rachel.

30:57.521 --> 30:58.521
And you believed her?

31:00.000 --> 31:01.913
She saved my life.

31:01.956 --> 31:03.521
I owed her that much.

31:05.217 --> 31:06.608
Gibbs.

31:07.652 --> 31:08.739
I was following up

31:08.782 --> 31:10.391
with the Naval
Special Warfare Group

31:10.434 --> 31:12.130
on Ryan Barnes's alibi.

31:12.173 --> 31:14.260
After the team
racked out at 2300,

31:14.304 --> 31:17.608
no one had a visual on him
until 0300 the next morning.

31:17.652 --> 31:18.739
Where was the training grid?

31:18.782 --> 31:20.043

only 12 miles

31:20.086 --> 31:21.521
from their house in Lake Ridge.

31:21.565 --> 31:23.782
Easy trek for a SEAL.

31:23.826 --> 31:24.695
Take DiNozzo,
bring him in.

31:26.608 --> 31:28.565
BISHOP: Front desk said Rachel and Ryan

31:28.608 --> 31:31.130
checked in yesterday,
but no one's seen them since.

31:31.173 --> 31:32.695
I usually suspect
the spouse,

31:32.739 --> 31:35.043
but I didn't see
this one coming.

31:35.086 --> 31:36.608
Maybe I'm getting
too Zen.

31:36.652 --> 31:37.956
Oh, this is it.

31:47.739 --> 31:49.000
I've seen this one.

32:02.739 --> 32:04.434
What are you waiting for?
Take the door.

32:04.478 --> 32:05.391
Really?

32:05.434 --> 32:06.782
Yeah.

32:06.826 --> 32:07.608
Would you like
a formal invitation?

32:07.652 --> 32:09.391
No, no. I got it.

32:12.869 --> 32:14.043
What are you doing?

32:14.086 --> 32:15.739
It's harder than it looks.

32:15.782 --> 32:17.304
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa!

32:18.434 --> 32:19.695
Remember when they gave you

32:19.739 --> 32:20.826
the key card at the front desk,

32:20.869 --> 32:21.869
G.I. Jane?

[imitates lock clicking]

32:23.086 --> 32:24.478
Oh.

32:24.521 --> 32:25.652
Right.

32:25.695 --> 32:27.565
Yeah.
Right.
Right, right.

32:27.608 --> 32:28.652
Got it.

32:44.478 --> 32:45.956

32:50.000 --> 32:51.391
Clear.

32:54.565 --> 32:55.869

32:55.913 --> 32:56.913
It wasn't.

32:56.956 --> 32:58.739
No bags, no trash.

32:58.782 --> 33:00.434
They didn't stay here.

Well, no hits on Commander
Barnes' credit cards or phone.

33:15.956 --> 33:17.608
He must know
we're tracking him.

33:17.652 --> 33:19.043
What about Rachel's phone?She's ten.

33:19.086 --> 33:20.739
That's 16 in girl years.

33:20.782 --> 33:22.782
Trust me, she's got a phone.

33:22.826 --> 33:23.652
I'm on it.

33:23.695 --> 33:25.260
BOLO's out.

33:25.304 --> 33:27.260
Airports, rail and bus
stations are on alert.

33:27.304 --> 33:28.739
He's got at least a six-hour
head start on us.

33:28.782 --> 33:30.869
That's a lot of ground to cover.And we cover it.

33:30.913 --> 33:33.608
You don't think he'd actually
hurt his own daughter, do you?

33:33.652 --> 33:35.956
I'm not waiting around
to find out.All right, I found them.

33:36.000 --> 33:37.956
Rachel's cell phone
is actively pinging.

33:38.000 --> 33:40.347
They're stopped at a rest area
on I-95 North.

33:40.391 --> 33:41.652
Let's go!
Send it to me, McGee.

33:43.869 --> 33:45.608
[crying]
I want to go home.

33:45.652 --> 33:47.043
Hey, hey.
Don't worry, sweetie.

33:47.086 --> 33:49.652
It's all gonna be over soon.

33:52.521 --> 33:54.652
It's not wise to sneak up
on me, Agent Gibbs.

33:54.695 --> 33:55.782
I'm armed.

33:55.826 --> 33:58.782
So are we.Drop the weapon, Commander.

33:58.826 --> 34:01.043
Don't make this any worse.Worse?

34:01.086 --> 34:02.956
My wife is dead.

34:03.000 --> 34:04.391
Let Rachel go.

34:05.652 --> 34:07.217
We'll talk about it.

34:10.217 --> 34:13.043
It wasn't supposed
to be this way.

34:15.086 --> 34:16.739
I don't know how it all
got so screwed up!

34:16.782 --> 34:18.217
Not too late to fix things.

34:18.260 --> 34:20.043
Yes, it is.Commander?

34:20.086 --> 34:21.782
Think of your daughter.

34:21.826 --> 34:23.652
[quietly]:
Daddy?

34:23.695 --> 34:25.695
I am.

34:31.086 --> 34:33.217
And it's time to come clean...

34:33.260 --> 34:34.478
Daddy!

34:34.521 --> 34:36.478
...for what I've done.

34:36.521 --> 34:37.521
[crying]

34:39.782 --> 34:41.173
Daddy!

34:42.739 --> 34:44.043
Daddy...?

34:44.086 --> 34:46.130
I killed my wife.Daddy!

34:48.913 --> 34:51.826
I'm very sorry, Rachel.

34:52.869 --> 34:54.043
I'm so very sorry,
sweetie.

35:03.086 --> 35:05.782
Jethro?

35:05.826 --> 35:07.478
I thought you'd gone
for the night.

35:09.000 --> 35:11.565
Something's not sitting
right with me, Duck.

35:11.608 --> 35:13.782
That makes two of us.

35:15.695 --> 35:18.869
Young Rachel Barnes'
medical records.

35:18.913 --> 35:22.695
Several broken bones, multiple
lacerations, two concussions.

35:22.739 --> 35:25.565
This child was the
victim of severe abuse.

35:25.608 --> 35:28.521
It's more than disturbing.

35:28.565 --> 35:30.391
What is it?

35:32.391 --> 35:34.173
Dates in this hospital report.

35:34.217 --> 35:36.304
They're all from
when the commander

35:36.347 --> 35:37.826
was deployed overseas.

35:37.869 --> 35:39.739
So, our killer
wasn't our abuser.

35:39.782 --> 35:42.391
It's another mystery
for you to solve.

35:42.434 --> 35:45.130
Sociopaths like George Burton,

35:45.173 --> 35:46.826
they will go to any extreme

35:46.869 --> 35:48.913
to get what they want.Indeed.

35:48.956 --> 35:51.782
They're impulsive, have no
regard for the consequences

35:51.826 --> 35:53.217
of their actions,

35:53.260 --> 35:55.695
not to mention a
total lack of remorse

35:55.739 --> 35:59.608
that makes them very
skillful at deception.

35:59.652 --> 36:00.782
Yeah, but Valerie knew that,

36:00.826 --> 36:02.695
and she did not
go to the police.

36:02.739 --> 36:06.086
She was protecting
someone closer to home.

36:06.130 --> 36:10.086
Hmm. Her husband may be
guilty of murder, but...

36:10.130 --> 36:13.304
Commander Barnes
doesn't exhibit

36:13.347 --> 36:16.782
any clinical signs
of being a sociopath.

36:16.826 --> 36:18.739
That's because he's
not our killer, Duck.

36:31.260 --> 36:32.869
Are we gonna build
another fort?

36:32.913 --> 36:34.043
No.

36:34.086 --> 36:35.826
Playtime's over.

36:35.869 --> 36:38.000
What's wrong, Agent Gibbs?

36:38.043 --> 36:40.608
You haven't been honest with me.

36:40.652 --> 36:42.739
What do you mean?

36:47.086 --> 36:48.869
I went back by your house.

36:48.913 --> 36:52.086
I did a little digging
under your fort.

36:54.130 --> 36:56.869
I didn't have time
to bury it deeper.

36:56.913 --> 36:58.782
I needed to get

36:58.826 --> 37:02.347
back before Mr. Curtis
realized I snuck out.

37:10.217 --> 37:12.739
Tell me what happened.

37:14.782 --> 37:16.652
Don't look at me like that.

37:16.695 --> 37:17.695
I want to help you.

37:17.739 --> 37:20.000
I can't help you

37:20.043 --> 37:21.913
if you don't let me.

37:21.956 --> 37:23.695
That's exactly
what my mother said.

37:23.739 --> 37:26.260
That she wanted to help me.

37:26.304 --> 37:28.826
She was gonna send me
to a special hospital

37:28.869 --> 37:30.739
in Montana for treatment.

37:30.782 --> 37:33.000
I don't need help.

37:33.043 --> 37:36.565
I hate that word.

37:36.608 --> 37:38.608
And I hated her.

37:38.652 --> 37:41.521
Yeah, but you don't hate
your dad, though, do you?

37:42.739 --> 37:45.260
No.

37:45.304 --> 37:48.260
Daddy didn't see what she did.

37:48.304 --> 37:50.869
Things were always better
when he was around.

37:52.695 --> 37:55.260
That's why you'd
injure yourself?

37:55.304 --> 37:57.608
So he'd come back?

37:57.652 --> 37:59.956
Sometimes it worked.

38:02.652 --> 38:05.260
But he'd never stay
as long as I wanted.

38:05.304 --> 38:07.956
Unless your mom was gone.

38:08.000 --> 38:10.217
Then he couldn't leave you.

38:11.304 --> 38:13.260
It's her own fault.

38:13.304 --> 38:16.869
All she ever did was
make me feel broken.

38:18.913 --> 38:22.739
Getting rid of her
was the best solution.

38:25.304 --> 38:28.869
Daddy didn't understand, either,
when I told him what I did.

38:30.739 --> 38:33.782
He'll come around eventually.

38:35.086 --> 38:38.913

39:05.782 --> 39:06.956
No. You're supposed
to be going

39:07.000 --> 39:08.434

39:08.478 --> 39:11.173
No, not when I'm going as Robin!

40:54.043 --> 40:55.217
Why don't you just act like

40:55.260 --> 40:56.782
we're back walking our
old beat again, huh?

40:56.826 --> 40:58.043
Oh, yeah.

40:58.086 --> 40:59.869
Where I ramble on
about nonsense

40:59.913 --> 41:01.478
and you listen patiently?

41:01.521 --> 41:04.130
How else do you think I got to
be such a good interrogator?

41:05.391 --> 41:07.043
I'm kind of curious.
You've been in D.C.

41:07.086 --> 41:09.478
for five years and you never
bothered to call me?

41:09.521 --> 41:10.652
What's up with that?

41:10.695 --> 41:12.521
Hmm?

41:14.086 --> 41:17.043
Tony, I didn't know
where you went.

41:17.086 --> 41:18.956
One day, we were patrolling

41:19.000 --> 41:20.304
River Drive, and the next...

41:20.347 --> 41:22.347
you were just gone.

41:24.304 --> 41:27.391
You just up and left.

41:27.434 --> 41:30.043
Not a phone call.

41:30.086 --> 41:31.434
Not a single word.

41:33.043 --> 41:34.347
Yeah.

41:34.391 --> 41:36.869
Forgot that part.

41:38.478 --> 41:39.913
Well, it wasn't you.

41:41.086 --> 41:43.173
I know.

41:43.217 --> 41:45.391
You needed to find
your own way.

41:45.434 --> 41:48.173
I never faulted
you for that.

41:48.217 --> 41:50.434
But I deserve better.

41:52.260 --> 41:55.173
You are absolutely right.

41:57.043 --> 42:00.304
And I am very sorry.

42:00.347 --> 42:03.652
It's in the past.

42:03.695 --> 42:05.826
I'm glad you found what
you were looking for.

42:05.869 --> 42:07.608
Although it's not
the most soothing

42:07.652 --> 42:09.739
shade of orange, but I
guess I get the appeal.

42:09.782 --> 42:10.956
I know.

42:11.000 --> 42:12.521
It's like working in a pumpkin.

42:12.565 --> 42:13.956
But it's home.

42:14.000 --> 42:16.000
How about you?

42:16.043 --> 42:17.782
Did you find
what you were looking for?

42:17.826 --> 42:21.434
I'm kind of still
a work in progress.

42:21.478 --> 42:23.695
Aren't we all?

42:25.478 --> 42:28.043
Well, I'll tell
you what, Keates.

42:28.086 --> 42:30.086
You and I have
some catching up to do.

42:30.130 --> 42:32.043
What do you say
we take a walk?

42:32.086 --> 42:33.608
Don't you have somewhere
you need to be?

42:33.652 --> 42:35.086
It can wait.

42:35.130 --> 42:37.043
Think of it
as an honorary street patrol.

42:37.086 --> 42:38.869
Except this time,
you'll do the talking

42:38.913 --> 42:40.043
and I'll do the listening.

42:40.086 --> 42:42.521
Well, we've never done
that one before.

42:47.347 --> 42:49.434
You clean up nice, Spider.

42:49.478 --> 42:51.913
Any chance we can leave
that nickname in the past?

42:51.956 --> 42:53.434
None whatsoever.
Get over yourself.

42:53.478 --> 42:56.173
Just like old times.

43:05.913 --> 43:08.913
