Cj Entertainment Presents

00:36.833 --> 00:37.874
They all said...

00:37.875 --> 00:38.957
A TPS Company Production

00:38.958 --> 00:40.999
the tree was rotting.

00:42.625 --> 00:43.666
But I told them...

00:43.667 --> 00:44.542
Executive Producer Jeong Tae-Sung

00:44.543 --> 00:47.167
it's far from it.

00:48.333 --> 00:50.916
I had a dream that night.

00:50.917 --> 00:52.916
Financing executives
Michelle Kwon Simon Lee

00:52.917 --> 00:53.917
In the dream,

00:54.917 --> 00:59.417
I saw the tree grow strong
towards the blue sky.

01:04.125 --> 01:08.625
I gathered everyone
and said the tree wasn't rotting.

01:11.958 --> 01:15.999
It was not a rotting tree.

01:28.500 --> 01:29.833
All units, Rappel!

01:30.333 --> 01:32.041
Rappeu Rappel!

01:34.667 --> 01:36.208

01:49.125 --> 01:50.750

01:59.833 --> 02:01.916

02:01.917 --> 02:02.750
Roger!

02:03.792 --> 02:05.458
"Cover"

02:06.375 --> 02:07.832
Disconnection Complete!

02:07.833 --> 02:08.999
"Conceal"

02:09.333 --> 02:11.708
Right in the chest, see ya!

02:12.292 --> 02:13.917
"Demolition"

02:16.792 --> 02:18.208
"Negative-Space"

02:22.167 --> 02:23.208
Sector's Clear!

02:23.375 --> 02:24.208
"Yong Guru"

02:26.833 --> 02:28.166
Captain!

02:28.625 --> 02:29.583
Hey, Mr. Hairy,

02:29.584 --> 02:31.958
if you tail Cap, he'll be exposed.

02:51.875 --> 02:54.125
Captain, I got the building scan.

02:54.625 --> 02:55.791
Look at those hostiles.

02:55.833 --> 02:57.874
How do we disarm the bomb inside?

02:57.875 --> 03:01.208
I'll take point, rest of you take the rear.

03:01.375 --> 03:03.625
Say what? You'll take point?

03:04.083 --> 03:05.499
Captain! Captain!

03:08.208 --> 03:10.374
Enemies! Enemies!

03:39.208 --> 03:40.749
Mr. Hairy, stay here.

03:48.375 --> 03:50.875
- Cap, we're inside!
- Over here!

04:20.791 --> 04:22.208
- Fall back!
- Sitrep!

04:22.292 --> 04:23.875
Cap, it's a trap!

04:24.833 --> 04:27.249
- Can you hold position?
- Not looking good.

04:27.250 --> 04:28.750
Cap, can you disarm the bomb?

04:29.458 --> 04:30.624
Leave it to me.

04:53.917 --> 04:55.542
Almost there, just a bit longer.

04:57.000 --> 04:58.166
Mr. Hairy!

04:58.167 --> 04:59.417
I don't believe this!

04:59.583 --> 05:00.874
I'm going in, give me cover!

05:00.875 --> 05:01.625
Hold position!

05:01.626 --> 05:03.291
Don't move! Stay there!

05:05.333 --> 05:08.541
Cap, I sent the bomb
blueprint, get to it asap!

05:08.917 --> 05:09.750
Captain!

05:10.042 --> 05:11.958
If you don't hurry, we'll be in danger! Go!

05:16.167 --> 05:19.917
Cap! Hairy's a lost cause,
leave him this time!

05:40.042 --> 05:41.417
Pull Mr. Hairy out!

05:41.833 --> 05:44.124
Yong Guru, demolition, go disarm the bomb!

05:45.542 --> 05:46.208
Roger!

05:46.292 --> 05:47.083
Roger!

05:47.250 --> 05:48.833
He's crazy.

05:49.042 --> 05:50.458
That's why he's our leader.

05:55.375 --> 05:56.875
Cap, we're here!

05:57.125 --> 05:58.416
Okay, on the double.

06:08.083 --> 06:09.999
Captain! Captain!

06:19.042 --> 06:21.333
- Captain!
- Yong Guru, hurry!

06:21.417 --> 06:24.500
A bit more, come on, hold out a bit more...

06:41.208 --> 06:42.374
Captain!

06:55.458 --> 06:57.083
"Captain Kwon, Kia"

07:00.583 --> 07:02.624
Disarm complete!

07:04.750 --> 07:06.833
"Round Won"

07:14.875 --> 07:16.666
We won without you.

07:16.667 --> 07:18.624
It's all Mr. Hairy's fault.

07:18.625 --> 07:20.624
Shouldn't he stick to another game?

07:20.625 --> 07:22.833
- Sorry.
- So long as we won.

07:23.292 --> 07:26.416
Cap, you're so dope.

07:26.417 --> 07:30.416
He knows he's the shit,
he calls himself 'Captain.'

07:30.417 --> 07:32.541
who cares about that,
I'm always getting killed.

07:32.542 --> 07:35.541
Because you're always
trying to save others.

07:35.542 --> 07:37.332
You're the one to talk, Hairy.

07:37.333 --> 07:40.374
Alright, since we won big,
let's meet up for dinner.

07:40.375 --> 07:41.832
$30 each!

07:41.833 --> 07:44.082
Cap, please come tonight!

07:44.083 --> 07:46.124
Being mysterious is overrated.

07:46.167 --> 07:48.832
Let's get a look at you for once.

07:48.833 --> 07:50.374
How's BBQ intestines?

07:50.375 --> 07:52.332
Deal! BBQ with Captain!

07:52.333 --> 07:55.041
I'm really busy nowadays...

07:55.042 --> 07:57.291
- Come on!
- Another time, perhaps.

07:57.292 --> 07:58.708
"Madam Lee" no, I wanna see you.

07:59.125 --> 08:00.999
What do you exactly do?

08:01.000 --> 08:02.958
I'm getting nonstop work calls.

08:03.542 --> 08:05.125
- I'm logging off.
- What? No!

08:06.458 --> 08:07.041
What?

08:07.042 --> 08:09.749
Where are you? PC Café again?

08:09.750 --> 08:10.541
No nagging.

08:10.542 --> 08:13.500
Are you a kid? Always playing games?

08:13.708 --> 08:15.624
Why are you calling me'?

08:15.958 --> 08:17.416
I left the stove gas valve on.

08:17.750 --> 08:18.791
Go lock it.

08:18.958 --> 08:21.541
You called me for that? Gas valve?

08:21.542 --> 08:23.707
It could blow up, go right now.

08:23.708 --> 08:25.499
Why would it blow up!

08:25.833 --> 08:26.749
I'm busy.

08:26.750 --> 08:28.749
So proud of you, you freeloader.

08:28.750 --> 08:29.791
Come on!

08:31.500 --> 08:34.082
I got overnight shift at the hospital.

08:34.082 --> 08:35.749
Go when I say nicely.

08:35.750 --> 08:36.916
I'm really busy!

08:36.917 --> 08:39.457
- See you tomorrow.
- Mom! Mom!

08:43.957 --> 08:44.833
Pretty, isn't it?

08:45.625 --> 08:49.208
My son bought it while on a school trip.

08:49.750 --> 08:51.208
It's germanium.

08:51.958 --> 08:54.416
It's good for health, apparently.

09:07.875 --> 09:08.791
"Team Eliminated"

09:15.583 --> 09:16.374
Hello?

09:16.375 --> 09:17.416
Is this PC Cafe'?

09:17.417 --> 09:19.749
I left my phone there.

09:19.750 --> 09:21.416
Could you bring it to me?

09:21.583 --> 09:23.124
- Right now I'm at...
- Wait a minute.

09:23.333 --> 09:24.749
I'm a really busy man.

09:24.750 --> 09:26.750
I'll pay you $300.

09:28.417 --> 09:30.500
I don't believe this.

09:34.208 --> 09:36.249
Where are you?

09:55.833 --> 09:57.083
Hello?

10:00.208 --> 10:01.333
Anyone home?

10:06.250 --> 10:07.666
What the hell?

10:15.083 --> 10:16.041
Excuse me?

10:17.958 --> 10:19.874
I brought your phone back.

10:20.125 --> 10:23.333
Hi, I'm in the shower.

10:23.542 --> 10:25.667
You can leave it anywhere.

10:25.875 --> 10:28.374
You said you'd pay me...

10:28.375 --> 10:30.750
It's on my bed upstairs.

10:33.167 --> 10:34.292
Okay.

10:41.458 --> 10:43.291
I left your phone on your bed.

10:50.167 --> 10:54.625
You should lock your door,
it could be dangerous.

11:21.958 --> 11:24.083
Get him! Grab him!

11:27.917 --> 11:29.208
Hold still, asshole!

11:30.042 --> 11:31.832
Be cool, don't resist!

11:31.833 --> 11:35.957
You're under arrest
for statutory rape and murder.

11:35.958 --> 11:37.249
You may plea the fifth...

11:37.250 --> 11:38.291
What's going on?

11:44.083 --> 11:46.124
- Call the forensics.
- Yes, Sir.

11:49.750 --> 11:50.875
I said don't move!

11:55.167 --> 11:56.292
Reveal his face!

12:02.500 --> 12:04.124
The rapist and murderer of ha...

12:04.125 --> 12:05.332
"Rape-murder suspect in custody"

12:05.333 --> 12:06.707
an underage victim.

12:06.708 --> 12:08.291
Was arrested this morning.

12:09.000 --> 12:11.625
The signature on this check, is this yours?

12:12.292 --> 12:13.292
That's right.

12:13.293 --> 12:14.458
Yes, but the thing is...

12:15.042 --> 12:17.707
What about your fingerprints
all over this knife?

12:17.708 --> 12:19.249
That's what I don't get...

12:19.250 --> 12:22.416
Prime suspect Kwon
was a National Taekwondo Athlete,

12:22.917 --> 12:25.666
"Kwon played violent game prior to killing"
but was dismissed after an assault case,

12:25.667 --> 12:28.332
and led a life of unemployment
and resorted to video games.

12:28.333 --> 12:29.916
He was a national athlete?

12:30.167 --> 12:30.792
What's with you?

12:30.793 --> 12:31.875
Where's my son?

12:32.125 --> 12:34.249
- You can't come here!
- Let go! Where's my son!

12:34.250 --> 12:35.416
Kwon Yu!

12:35.875 --> 12:38.416
The suspect is denying all charges,

12:38.417 --> 12:39.832
while fingerprints and DNA

12:39.833 --> 12:42.749
"DNA comparison processed"
found at the crime scene

12:42.750 --> 12:45.374
were sent to forensics lab for analysis.

12:45.375 --> 12:46.874
From a tissue found at the scene,

12:46.875 --> 12:47.958
"DNA Analysis Report"

12:48.833 --> 12:50.833
your sperm was detected.

12:52.500 --> 12:53.833
My son is not a killer.

12:53.875 --> 12:55.707
Please read this.

12:55.708 --> 12:58.499
Please read this.

12:58.500 --> 13:00.458
My son was framed.

13:00.833 --> 13:02.749
Please read this, thank you.

13:04.833 --> 13:07.624
You have no conscience, he's a monster.

13:11.667 --> 13:15.999
The DNA found at the scene are
that of suspect Kwon Yu,

13:16.000 --> 13:19.208
and the court is
pressured to hand out a shift justice.

13:19.833 --> 13:20.999
Attorney min,

13:21.000 --> 13:24.082
my boy would never kill a person.

13:24.083 --> 13:25.249
Please look at this.

13:25.250 --> 13:26.582
You can leave the documents there.

13:26.583 --> 13:28.041
Please take a look.

13:28.042 --> 13:29.875
He won an award.

13:30.042 --> 13:31.791
Sir, since he was a child...

13:31.792 --> 13:33.958
Hello, attorney-at-law Min Chum-Sang.

13:34.875 --> 13:38.791
Yes, I'm a public defender,
what can I do for you?

13:43.083 --> 13:45.249
Don't worry too much.

13:45.250 --> 13:47.916
Send us the documents,
and we'll review them.

13:48.208 --> 13:49.374
Yes.

13:49.917 --> 13:51.500
Thank you.

13:52.792 --> 13:57.292
I raised him even more strictly
because he didn't have a father.

13:57.542 --> 13:59.250
From the way I look at it,

14:00.000 --> 14:01.500
you should...

14:02.083 --> 14:04.333
Ask your son to confess and admit it.

14:04.625 --> 14:06.207
At least he'll get extenuation.

14:06.208 --> 14:08.499
But Mr. Min, you didn't even listen...

14:08.500 --> 14:11.374
The evidence against him are massive,

14:11.375 --> 14:13.957
so if he continues to deny,
it could get worse...

14:13.958 --> 14:15.083
Ma'am? Ma'am?

14:15.208 --> 14:16.499
Could we talk?

14:17.000 --> 14:19.207
Did the Police tell you to come here?

14:19.208 --> 14:23.124
Mr. Min is all about helping those in need.

14:23.125 --> 14:25.875
- If you go home and wait...
- Mr. Min!

14:26.542 --> 14:29.125
Please believe my boy.

14:30.375 --> 14:34.666
The defendant quickly left the crime scene
after the murder...

14:34.667 --> 14:36.374
Only collected the reward...

14:36.375 --> 14:40.875
The prints on the knife
and the door knob match Kwon's.

14:44.083 --> 14:47.708
After sexually assaulting a minor twice,

14:48.250 --> 14:51.874
Kwon stabbed her 31 times
in the neck and abdomen,

14:51.875 --> 14:55.374
and moved the body to the washroom
to wipe it down.

14:55.375 --> 14:56.416
Please be quiet!

14:56.417 --> 14:57.749
I really didn't do it.

14:57.750 --> 15:02.250
When a game addict indulges,
he can't tell reality from fantasy.

15:03.125 --> 15:07.625
That's why he'd commit antisocial
acts without remorse.

15:08.625 --> 15:11.416
Capital punishment or castration!

15:11.417 --> 15:12.624
Just castrate him!

15:12.625 --> 15:16.249
"Councilor proposes 'Kwon Yu Bill" '
Councilor Park introduced a Bill

15:16.250 --> 15:19.041
for harsher rape punishment.

15:19.042 --> 15:21.249
After his dismissal from the national team,

15:21.250 --> 15:25.708
please understand that
he suffered from heavy depression.

15:26.500 --> 15:31.000
Despite clear evidence against him,

15:31.917 --> 15:36.417
defendant Kwon Yu refuses
to admit any wrongdoings.

15:36.833 --> 15:38.583
As such,

15:39.125 --> 15:43.625
the defendant is
guilty of sexual assault of a minor,

15:44.708 --> 15:49.208
first degree murder of a minor,
and desecrating a human corpse,

15:50.542 --> 15:52.499
and he is sentenced as follows.

15:52.500 --> 15:56.750
Life imprisonment without parole.

16:00.292 --> 16:01.458
It wasn't my boy!

16:02.167 --> 16:03.542
No way! No!

16:03.667 --> 16:04.417
He didn't do it! No!

16:04.418 --> 16:06.541
It wasn't me! I don't know anything!

16:06.542 --> 16:07.750
Kwon Yu!

16:08.250 --> 16:09.833
It wasn't me! Mom!

16:10.083 --> 16:11.249
Mom! Mom!

16:11.250 --> 16:13.124
The defendant's identity

16:13.125 --> 16:17.625
will be made visible
to the public for 10 years.

16:18.792 --> 16:22.082
As part of rehabilitation,

16:22.083 --> 16:25.958
he'll undergo 5-year
sexual impulse treatment.

16:26.583 --> 16:30.541
In addition,
due to violent nature of his crime,

16:30.875 --> 16:34.125
and as he requires isolation
from the society,

16:34.333 --> 16:38.833
he will serve his sentence
in maximum security prison.

16:42.667 --> 16:44.957
- Wait! Please!
- Come out!

16:44.958 --> 16:47.457
Come out, asshole!

16:47.458 --> 16:50.208
Wait! It wasn't me!

18:22.583 --> 18:23.874
Come here!

18:23.875 --> 18:25.458
Out of my way!

18:50.542 --> 18:51.833
You came in for this, right?

18:52.708 --> 18:53.749
Rape.

18:54.792 --> 18:56.457
Raping a kiddie. You bastard.

18:56.458 --> 18:57.999
It wasn't me.

18:58.125 --> 18:59.166
Asshole!

19:00.458 --> 19:02.499
How dare you talk back!

19:03.208 --> 19:04.291
Son of a bitch!

19:07.750 --> 19:10.250
Look around, look at them.

19:11.792 --> 19:14.541
They're all proud of their crimes.
"I committed murder!"

19:14.542 --> 19:16.207
"I beat him until he stopped breathing!"

19:16.208 --> 19:18.207
"I feel bad for not killing him!"

19:18.208 --> 19:19.666
Look at this Chump.

19:19.833 --> 19:21.374
You're denying everything.

19:21.542 --> 19:23.667
"It wasn't me, I didn't do it!"

19:25.000 --> 19:26.332
"You're all wrong! It was consensual!"

19:26.333 --> 19:27.457
"It was love! We loved each other!"

19:27.458 --> 19:29.208
Fuck!

19:30.625 --> 19:32.416
Come at me, asshole!

19:34.333 --> 19:36.124
Boss! Boss!

19:37.083 --> 19:38.666
Go! Go!

19:38.667 --> 19:39.833
Son of a bitch!

19:40.792 --> 19:42.583
Move aside!

19:48.167 --> 19:49.791
Stay back!

19:49.792 --> 19:52.208
Are you fucking nuts!

19:52.833 --> 19:55.999
When an adult talks, just say,
"Yes, I understand, Sir!"

19:56.000 --> 19:59.499
That's common courtesy.
Don't hit the ground!

19:59.500 --> 20:02.124
How dare you sucker punch me!

20:02.125 --> 20:03.291
My hand!

20:04.083 --> 20:05.457
You're dead meat.

20:05.458 --> 20:07.041
Goddammit!

20:07.208 --> 20:08.416
Stand back!

20:08.417 --> 20:09.542
Ma Duk-Su.

20:09.875 --> 20:11.624
I got hit, I'm the victim.

20:11.625 --> 20:12.874
He hit me first.

20:12.875 --> 20:14.375
They're all witnesses.

20:14.625 --> 20:16.208
Look, bloody nose.

20:20.875 --> 20:21.958
Take him away.

20:32.167 --> 20:34.792
Kwon Yu, 30 days in isolation.

21:01.208 --> 21:03.041
I heard you sucker punched ma.

21:04.542 --> 21:05.833
It's okay, it's okay.

21:06.250 --> 21:09.207
We don't play with them,
we're on your side.

21:09.208 --> 21:12.583
For someone who got life,
how could you assault him?

21:13.000 --> 21:15.250
You need to be on his good side.

21:15.750 --> 21:16.791
Like me.

21:16.792 --> 21:18.875
And him, watch out for him.

21:19.375 --> 21:20.624
He's a serial killer.

21:20.625 --> 21:23.332
He ate the person he killed.

21:23.333 --> 21:26.041
Watch out for him and Ma Duk-Su.

21:26.042 --> 21:29.625
Anyway, let's get some details.

21:33.167 --> 21:34.542
How old was she?

21:35.583 --> 21:36.958
Middle school?

21:37.083 --> 21:38.291
High school?

21:39.292 --> 21:41.999
School uniform or plain clothes? Tell us!

21:42.000 --> 21:44.291
We have to stick together,
you could die on your own!

21:57.250 --> 21:58.250
You bastard!

21:59.917 --> 22:01.042
Get him!

22:10.667 --> 22:12.292
I really hate

22:14.500 --> 22:16.791
those who don't repent.

22:17.167 --> 22:21.167
If you committed a crime,
you must repent and start anew.

22:21.458 --> 22:23.958
Already starting a fight,
misbehaving and shit.

22:26.167 --> 22:30.667
After today, I want to see you
repenting and remorseful.

22:35.917 --> 22:36.999
Please don't kill us.

22:37.000 --> 22:38.166
Come on, get ready.

22:44.292 --> 22:45.375
Do it.

22:45.750 --> 22:47.082
What you did to the kiddie.

22:47.083 --> 22:48.541
Shit, are you nuts?

22:49.875 --> 22:52.666
How about you? Can you do him?

22:52.958 --> 22:55.332
What? Yes! Yes!

22:55.333 --> 22:57.874
I'll do it, I'll do my best!

22:58.583 --> 22:59.416
Go on.

22:59.417 --> 23:02.458
Let me go, you fucking quacks!

23:08.333 --> 23:12.624
"My son is not a killer!"

23:14.625 --> 23:15.625
You bitch!

23:17.042 --> 23:18.417
Grab him!

23:19.292 --> 23:23.458
- Hold still, you shit!
- Don't move!

24:02.500 --> 24:04.250
It's tough in there, right?

24:08.000 --> 24:09.416
I went on...

24:10.708 --> 24:13.166
In person protest in front of the court,

24:14.375 --> 24:17.375
and had an interview with a news magazine,

24:18.250 --> 24:21.125
and thanks to that

24:22.458 --> 24:26.291
I got in touch with someone
who knows your alibi.

24:27.542 --> 24:32.042
I'll meet him next week
and start the appeal process.

24:36.167 --> 24:37.042
Honey.

24:50.000 --> 24:51.000
I...

24:53.292 --> 24:55.833
Don't want to be a rapist's mom.

24:57.583 --> 24:59.791
If you don't want to be a rapist,

25:00.875 --> 25:03.000
stay strong and endure.

25:06.125 --> 25:10.625
I'm going to get you out of here.

25:33.167 --> 25:34.625
Look at him.

25:35.208 --> 25:37.166
He's got that drive to live.

25:37.833 --> 25:38.916
Then I better help.

26:19.292 --> 26:21.500
Rub that on your wounds.

26:24.792 --> 26:27.541
You must've been an athlete.

26:27.542 --> 26:30.833
You protected pressure points
even during beatings.

26:51.375 --> 26:53.791
I've been watching you.

26:53.792 --> 26:55.917
You're not a killer type.

26:59.792 --> 27:03.458
I'm sure ma knows you're
not a rapist-murderer.

27:08.042 --> 27:11.208
You simply messed with his self-esteem.

29:05.000 --> 29:06.375
Ma's down cold!

29:11.667 --> 29:14.000
Kwon Yu, you got a visitor.

29:29.292 --> 29:30.458
Did you come alone?

29:31.958 --> 29:32.791
What about mom?

29:41.292 --> 29:43.250
"Death Certificate: Lee Yeon-Kay"

29:44.417 --> 29:45.958
What's this?

29:52.958 --> 29:55.499
She's had some hard time,

29:57.250 --> 29:59.541
but I didn't think she'd go this far...

29:59.542 --> 30:02.167
What are you saying?

30:02.333 --> 30:03.958
Why would she?

30:04.083 --> 30:05.874
She said she'd get me out,

30:06.625 --> 30:08.375
and told me to stay strong...

30:10.208 --> 30:13.208
Why'd she do this all of a sudden?

30:13.500 --> 30:16.375
To have a funeral, you must sign it.

30:18.250 --> 30:22.750
The district office will
take care of the funeral.

30:24.417 --> 30:28.917
But you won't be able to attend it.

30:31.167 --> 30:35.333
I tried to get you to attend,
but the motion was denied.

31:46.417 --> 31:47.625
Mom!

31:50.667 --> 31:51.833
Mom...

32:04.667 --> 32:06.417
Mom!

32:07.500 --> 32:09.708
Mom!

32:55.667 --> 32:57.083
Don't resist!

33:32.167 --> 33:34.000
Kwon Yu! Drop the shiv!

34:07.333 --> 34:11.833
If artery, muscle or organs are damaged,
you're fucked.

34:12.792 --> 34:15.625
So don't stab too deep, go for waist, okay?

34:19.500 --> 34:21.041
Got a plan once outside?

34:23.333 --> 34:24.916
I'm gonna clear my name.

34:26.167 --> 34:28.417
I promised my mom that

34:29.000 --> 34:30.458
I would not be a rapist.

34:42.833 --> 34:43.833
Give me the key.

36:28.583 --> 36:32.166
Rapist-murderer Kwon Yu
escaped from prison yesterday.

36:32.167 --> 36:33.666
When the Police reached the scene,

36:33.667 --> 36:36.583
Kwon Yu was nowhere to be found,

36:36.708 --> 36:40.999
and they sent out
nation-wide all-points bulletin.

36:41.000 --> 36:43.374
Kwon's current whereabouts are unknown,

36:43.375 --> 36:47.041
and his uniform
was recovered at a fishing site...

36:47.042 --> 36:51.542
The Police found blood on his uniform,
and he is presumed to be injured,

36:52.167 --> 36:55.332
so he may not have gotten far.

36:55.333 --> 36:57.499
"Police issued Nationwide APB"
they're fortifying

36:57.500 --> 36:59.541
checkpoints bus terminals,

36:59.542 --> 37:04.042
and searching nearby mountains
and put blockades on main roads.

37:16.333 --> 37:19.833
Hey! Hey! Help!

37:29.583 --> 37:31.541
You're quite handy!

37:31.625 --> 37:32.791
Amazing!

37:32.792 --> 37:34.082
Amazing!

37:34.083 --> 37:36.916
We would've had to cancel the whole
vacation if it weren't for you.

37:36.917 --> 37:38.166
Our hero.

37:38.167 --> 37:41.500
We're going to Cheongju Airport.
How do you say?

37:42.000 --> 37:46.333
- Cheongju Airport.
- Right, Cheongju Airport.

37:46.875 --> 37:50.041
We're going to Hangzhou, China.

37:50.042 --> 37:51.667
Yeah, in China. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

37:52.083 --> 37:54.374
Backpacking!

37:54.833 --> 37:56.124
So happy!

38:01.417 --> 38:02.541
What's this?

38:02.542 --> 38:03.917
Road block in place.

38:18.083 --> 38:18.999
This is a checkpoint...

38:19.000 --> 38:20.457
What's going on? I don't have all day.

38:20.458 --> 38:21.541
We have to go. We have to go

38:21.542 --> 38:23.041
wait, wait, wait! I know, I know.

38:23.042 --> 38:24.457
Listen, we really gotta go.

38:24.458 --> 38:25.374
We really have a plane to catch.

38:25.375 --> 38:27.749
- How about you let me talk to the officer.
- Okay? Fine, alright.

38:27.750 --> 38:29.291
- Pass!
- Okay, thank you.

38:29.292 --> 38:30.292
- Pass?
- Thank you, thank you

38:30.293 --> 38:32.583
thank you!

38:32.917 --> 38:35.458
No sighting at the road into town.

38:51.583 --> 38:54.707
We bought for 200,000 won
when we first came to Korea,

38:54.708 --> 38:56.374
now you can scrap it for...

38:56.917 --> 38:58.166
How do you say 40?

38:58.167 --> 39:00.083
400,000 won.

39:00.375 --> 39:01.541
Shit car, shit car.

39:02.667 --> 39:04.000
Thank you.

39:04.500 --> 39:05.583
Thank you.

39:22.708 --> 39:25.624
It's day 2 of the hunt for fugitive Kwon,

39:25.625 --> 39:28.249
and it is expected to go on for a while.

39:28.250 --> 39:31.457
People have raised concerns

39:31.458 --> 39:34.583
about additional rapes and murders
with Kwon at large.

39:45.708 --> 39:48.291
I completely forgot to bring the painting.

39:49.458 --> 39:51.583
My memory isn't what it used to be.

39:52.083 --> 39:53.583
Chairman Chu Sang-Duk?

39:54.708 --> 39:56.749
Chairman Chu...

39:59.625 --> 40:01.416
Oh, Hyosin group?

40:04.500 --> 40:09.000
I'll get back to you
after reviewing the scene tomorrow.

40:22.708 --> 40:23.708
My painting...

40:23.917 --> 40:28.000
I'm a wanted man, so I
had nowhere else to go.

40:28.417 --> 40:31.208
I snuck in without permission,
sorry about that.

40:43.542 --> 40:45.083
"112"

40:50.083 --> 40:53.999
when you came to visit with my mom,

40:54.875 --> 40:56.416
she mentioned

40:57.000 --> 40:58.541
a person who knows my alibi...

40:58.542 --> 40:59.833
- Alibi?
- Yes.

41:00.000 --> 41:02.125
Did you meet that person?

41:02.292 --> 41:04.624
You didn't escape to meet him, did you?

41:04.625 --> 41:09.125
I don't know who he is,
but I need to meet him.

41:11.375 --> 41:14.875
It's weird that Mom'd commit suicide
while prepping my appeal.

41:16.625 --> 41:18.749
I have to meet him and...

41:18.750 --> 41:22.875
It was a false tip, a prank call from kids.

41:24.917 --> 41:27.667
She took it really badly.

41:28.917 --> 41:31.333
She couldn't possibly look at you again.

41:33.250 --> 41:35.582
She cried for days,

41:35.583 --> 41:37.374
and chose her fate.

41:40.875 --> 41:44.375
This belonged to her. Recognize it?

41:52.333 --> 41:53.666
I called the Police.

41:54.292 --> 41:57.417
I'll look into your case further,
give yourself up.

42:01.792 --> 42:02.750
Kwon Yu, freeze!

42:03.250 --> 42:04.416
He's not here.

42:07.583 --> 42:09.124
"Kwon Yu"

42:11.208 --> 42:12.416
"fugitive Kwon Yu at large"

42:14.208 --> 42:14.874
"Police recover Kwon Yu's prison
uniform at a fishing site"

42:34.250 --> 42:35.666
"ls Kwon Yu the real killer?"

42:40.250 --> 42:44.750
Rapist and killer of a minor,
video game addict Kwon Yu...

42:44.958 --> 42:46.207
Mr. Hairy?

42:46.208 --> 42:50.624
There are many discrepancies
in the investigation of his case.

42:50.958 --> 42:54.624
The CCTV evidence submitted
by the prosecution

42:54.625 --> 42:59.125
only has footages with Kwon
and nothing before or after.

42:59.958 --> 43:02.541
The prosecution said
it was a recorder malfunction.

43:03.250 --> 43:07.750
They also never knew
about a Dashcam footage

43:07.792 --> 43:09.833
that shows Kwon.

43:10.458 --> 43:13.999
The car owner wanted to use
this footage for just reasons

43:14.000 --> 43:16.499
and sent it to a media outlet.

43:16.500 --> 43:20.624
But for an unknown reason,
the footage was mishandled,

43:20.625 --> 43:23.333
and it almost got buried
in the station server.

43:23.833 --> 43:27.624
A newbie hacker was
hacking the station's servers

43:27.625 --> 43:29.833
and came across it by chance.

43:30.167 --> 43:33.166
Unlike the prosecution's argument,

43:33.167 --> 43:35.624
Kwon was seen entering
and exiting the motel

43:35.625 --> 43:38.125
in exactly 3 minutes and 16 seconds.

43:38.458 --> 43:42.958
Is it logically possible
to have sex twice and stab her,

43:43.625 --> 43:47.208
then move the body to the washroom

43:48.000 --> 43:49.666
and scrub it of any evidence?

43:49.833 --> 43:54.124
In order to look into ha Ji-Su's
whereabouts prior to her death,

43:54.125 --> 43:57.000
we scoured her Facebook
and Instagram pages,

43:57.833 --> 44:02.291
and found her at a club 2 days
before her demise.

44:02.667 --> 44:06.999
It wasn't hard to find
her in the club CCTV.

44:07.000 --> 44:10.291
3 am, she left the club with a man,

44:10.292 --> 44:13.666
and her body was found a day
and a half afterwards.

44:13.667 --> 44:17.625
The man in question never became a suspect.

44:17.875 --> 44:20.249
But unemployed Kwon Yu
was immediately arrested...

44:20.250 --> 44:21.582
"Gwangjin district rape-murder
suspect in custody"

44:21.583 --> 44:22.541
Cap! Get out of there!

44:22.542 --> 44:24.083
The manager's onto you!

44:25.667 --> 44:27.750
Hello? The fugitive...

44:33.792 --> 44:36.500
Cap, come to Namyang Cafe'
in Bukchang district.

44:37.458 --> 44:38.499
Let's meet there.

44:42.542 --> 44:43.875
Welcome.

44:44.625 --> 44:46.416
Handsome young fella.

44:53.042 --> 44:54.500
Good bye, sweetie!

44:59.292 --> 45:00.750
This is Namyang Café.

45:01.833 --> 45:02.999
Mr. Hairy?

45:04.000 --> 45:06.166
Is there someone named 'Captain'?

45:08.750 --> 45:10.541
Is there a 'Captain'?

45:15.917 --> 45:17.875
Is this a prank call?

45:18.917 --> 45:21.416
Eh? You're 'Captain'?

45:21.417 --> 45:25.499
Mr. Hairy? Is this the right place?

45:25.500 --> 45:27.208
I just got here.

45:27.417 --> 45:28.417
Where are you?

45:45.667 --> 45:48.750
Who are you? What's going on?

45:53.167 --> 45:56.499
Did Mr. Hairy send you?

45:56.500 --> 45:58.875
"Mr. Hairy"

46:01.750 --> 46:02.666
Mr. Hairy?

46:03.250 --> 46:05.333
What's going on here?

46:06.000 --> 46:08.375
Who is this person?

46:10.208 --> 46:12.041
Is she trustworthy?

46:12.875 --> 46:14.583
- You can't just...
- It's me.

46:15.667 --> 46:16.458
What?

46:17.833 --> 46:19.249
The one in front of you.

46:19.250 --> 46:20.208
Hello?

46:21.917 --> 46:23.208
I'm Mr. Hairy.

46:30.792 --> 46:33.750
But your voice...

46:34.500 --> 46:36.208
There's a voice app.

46:37.000 --> 46:39.000
It's a voice modulator.

47:32.542 --> 47:33.542
"Mr. Hairy"

47:37.417 --> 47:38.875
sit anywhere.

47:40.125 --> 47:41.625
It's safe here.

47:52.542 --> 47:54.125
Rice delivery!

47:54.917 --> 47:56.917
Leave it right there.

47:57.792 --> 47:59.542
Who could be living here?

48:04.292 --> 48:05.250
Holy cow!

48:12.208 --> 48:13.249
Is this rice?

48:14.125 --> 48:16.500
Don't you live alone?

48:16.750 --> 48:19.375
Where do you want it, Mr. Hairy?

50:04.083 --> 50:04.958
Yeah?

50:09.917 --> 50:11.750
They'll be here soon.

50:12.875 --> 50:16.208
Don't let them see you like this,
you're still Cap.

50:27.375 --> 50:28.666
That was a hike.

50:35.375 --> 50:37.083
Mr. Hairy! We want some too.

50:37.458 --> 50:38.541
Extra portion for me.

50:38.542 --> 50:39.625
Looks delicious!

50:40.750 --> 50:43.124
This neighborhood's making me hungry.

50:43.125 --> 50:44.957
I thought I was gonna starve
to death on that hike.

50:44.958 --> 50:47.791
No CCTVs around, and pretty safe too.

50:47.792 --> 50:48.750
Right, Cap?

50:48.751 --> 50:50.750
So we finally get to meet?

50:52.375 --> 50:53.208
Thank you.

50:53.209 --> 50:55.374
I bought some eggs on the way.

50:56.792 --> 51:01.291
We met Mr. Hairy yesterday
for the first time.

51:01.292 --> 51:03.500
She never came to any get-together,

51:03.875 --> 51:07.791
but after hearing of your
escape she called us.

51:07.792 --> 51:09.541
- Come on, sit.
- That wasn't all.

51:09.542 --> 51:13.624
She took control of my PC
and made me watch stuff.

51:13.625 --> 51:15.541
She only talks over the phone.

51:15.833 --> 51:19.083
Do you have sociophobia or something?

51:19.125 --> 51:22.583
I was moved, your documentary.

51:23.542 --> 51:25.374
Wait a minute, please.

51:25.375 --> 51:27.375
So you're all...

51:27.625 --> 51:28.957
This is Yong Guru.

51:28.958 --> 51:31.499
When Yongsan Mall went bust,

51:31.500 --> 51:35.291
he's a legendary technician
who became half-unemployed.

51:35.292 --> 51:37.333
And this is demolition.

51:38.500 --> 51:40.791
I'm demolition,
I work in a special effects team.

51:40.792 --> 51:43.083
Those cool stuff you see in films,

51:43.542 --> 51:44.832
I work on those.

51:44.833 --> 51:46.124
He's a newbie.

51:46.708 --> 51:48.416
And I'm...

51:48.417 --> 51:51.875
Negative-space, college
architecture professor.

51:52.208 --> 51:54.666
Or so he says!

51:56.625 --> 51:57.416
So why are you all...

51:57.417 --> 51:59.624
We can't stand idle and let you get framed.

51:59.625 --> 52:01.000
We must all help!

52:01.042 --> 52:04.124
Thank you for the thought,
but I can do this on my...

52:04.125 --> 52:05.332
Come on!

52:05.333 --> 52:07.291
That's not right at all, we must help.

52:07.292 --> 52:09.374
I appreciate the thought...

52:09.375 --> 52:11.625
There's a couple who couldn't make it,

52:11.875 --> 52:13.332
Cover and Conceal.

52:13.333 --> 52:17.416
Online adult broadcasters,
who help the young and lonely!

52:17.417 --> 52:19.167
Stars in the adult industry!

52:19.708 --> 52:22.416
Did he mention where he was going?

52:22.500 --> 52:24.041
No, he didn't say.

52:30.333 --> 52:31.749
You must be a busy man.

52:31.792 --> 52:33.958
Yes, a little bit.

52:34.375 --> 52:38.208
If he calls, contact us right away.

52:38.417 --> 52:39.042
Okay.

52:39.043 --> 52:40.208
You may leave.

52:41.375 --> 52:42.000
Okay.

52:48.583 --> 52:49.749
Do you...

52:50.667 --> 52:53.625
Still have his case files?

52:54.458 --> 52:55.833
May I review them?

53:00.042 --> 53:03.542
Stop nosing around and stick to your job.

53:03.875 --> 53:05.291
Mr. public defender.

53:05.333 --> 53:06.416
Sure...

53:07.167 --> 53:08.207
Yes, Ms. Lee.

53:08.208 --> 53:12.708
I visited the site
of Chairman Chu's job earlier.

53:12.750 --> 53:16.875
I sent you Kwon Yu's prison record
to your e-mail.

53:22.083 --> 53:23.333
Kwon Yu...

53:26.625 --> 53:27.875
Ma Duk-Su?

53:28.625 --> 53:32.791
Drug distribution, attempted murder,
human trafficking,

53:32.792 --> 53:34.667
dealing weapons to gangsters...

53:35.333 --> 53:38.458
Kwon's got balls for beating him up.

53:42.167 --> 53:44.416
You fucking asshole!
Look at the traffic behind you!

53:44.417 --> 53:46.957
I'll pour gasoline up
your butt and light it!

53:46.958 --> 53:48.541
You impotent fuck!

53:48.542 --> 53:50.625
Take the bus, dipshit!

53:54.042 --> 53:57.833
62n6089, 'foul mouth'.

53:58.458 --> 53:59.916
Common pattern?

54:00.875 --> 54:04.582
I've dissected recent violent crimes

54:04.583 --> 54:06.624
that have similar traits.

54:06.625 --> 54:09.333
Must we talk on the phone?

54:09.667 --> 54:11.916
Am I the only one who thinks this is weird?

54:11.917 --> 54:13.707
So what about the pattern?

54:13.708 --> 54:15.332
Most criminals tend to

54:15.333 --> 54:17.457
conceal the evidence as much as possible.

54:17.458 --> 54:20.207
Right, that's what anyone would do.

54:20.208 --> 54:23.041
But these cases' most important aspect is,

54:23.042 --> 54:27.041
all pieces of evidence are
displayed like an exhibition.

54:27.042 --> 54:28.791
Goosebumps!

54:28.792 --> 54:29.417
Hey!

54:29.458 --> 54:33.957
The suspects are caught
within 24 hours after the crime,

54:33.958 --> 54:36.416
and their identities are
exposed even before their trial.

54:36.417 --> 54:39.999
But those alone
can't be seen as common patterns.

54:40.000 --> 54:42.208
I think that's enough
to establish a pattern.

54:43.042 --> 54:44.083
Do you feel this?

54:54.458 --> 54:56.791
Look at this screen.

54:56.792 --> 54:59.124
I scoured all CCTVs

54:59.125 --> 55:03.624
within 1km of the motel
when Cap went there.

55:03.625 --> 55:04.750
What about the truck?

55:05.333 --> 55:06.083
Do you see it?

55:06.084 --> 55:07.499
It's a composite!

55:07.958 --> 55:08.999
It's fake, look!

55:09.000 --> 55:10.957
If you look at the time-code,

55:10.958 --> 55:13.499
it looks like the truck
was there for an hour.

55:13.500 --> 55:16.250
So they wanted to hide where it went.

55:16.708 --> 55:17.916
Right.

55:18.417 --> 55:21.500
Was the truck present on other cases too?

55:25.667 --> 55:27.208
Who are these guys?

55:27.333 --> 55:31.416
I cross-referenced their
registered addresses.

55:32.833 --> 55:35.749
They all belong to a junkyard near Incheon.

55:37.583 --> 55:39.499
Negative and Yong were so jealous of me.

55:39.500 --> 55:42.333
Because I'm going with you.

55:48.792 --> 55:51.875
You're a god among us users.

55:52.750 --> 55:54.458
There! Look!

55:55.542 --> 55:57.000
It's really here!

55:57.292 --> 55:58.500
This is big!

56:00.833 --> 56:02.624
Mr. Hairy was right.

56:05.000 --> 56:07.750
Suits in a junkyard don't feel right.

56:08.750 --> 56:10.708
I'll follow the SUV,

56:11.042 --> 56:12.707
can you hold the fort here?

56:12.708 --> 56:13.541
Me?

56:13.750 --> 56:16.166
Can you do it? Of course you can.

57:49.625 --> 57:52.125
Cap, that Audi from earlier is back.

58:03.167 --> 58:06.250
Eh? It's being changed into a fridge truck.

58:06.667 --> 58:07.667
Who are they?

58:08.208 --> 58:09.291
They're leaving.

58:09.458 --> 58:10.624
What do I do?

58:14.000 --> 58:15.250
Go after them?

58:16.292 --> 58:17.417
I don't have a vehicle.

58:20.500 --> 58:21.916
Are you a cop?

58:23.250 --> 58:24.791
Gramps! Step on it!

58:26.042 --> 58:27.500
I was a marine!

58:27.917 --> 58:29.583
Cap! Cap!

58:32.167 --> 58:33.750
There, it's that building.

58:34.000 --> 58:36.291
They were delivering a fridge.

58:37.208 --> 58:39.333
I tried everything to sneak in,

58:39.500 --> 58:42.541
but I couldn't, what do we do?

58:51.542 --> 58:52.624
I got it.

58:52.625 --> 58:54.957
Okay, negative, Yong, go in.

58:54.958 --> 58:58.791
Most technicians will
insist on coming in the morning.

58:58.792 --> 59:02.207
They don't come running like us,
we got responsibility.

59:02.208 --> 59:04.624
People nowadays lack strong will.

59:05.958 --> 59:07.999
This is our specialist.

59:08.500 --> 59:10.500
A legend in his field.

59:11.542 --> 59:13.125
I'll go take a look.

59:13.375 --> 59:15.791
Oh yeah, I don't know if you've heard,

59:15.833 --> 59:19.708
the manager of an apartment
near here got the axe.

59:20.208 --> 59:21.249
- He did?
- Yeah.

59:21.458 --> 59:25.291
He said he worked responsibly
and to his fullest...

59:25.292 --> 59:28.750
Yong Guru, find the main server
and connect me to it.

59:29.000 --> 59:30.249
He wasn't just fussy,

59:30.250 --> 59:33.291
he was shameless, isn't that right?

59:33.292 --> 59:35.457
What's your opinion on that? Do you agree?

59:35.458 --> 59:36.374
I don't understand...

59:36.375 --> 59:38.582
Main server... Main server...

59:38.583 --> 59:40.499
What I'm saying is...

59:40.917 --> 59:45.417
What was I saying? I lost
my train of thought.

59:45.875 --> 59:47.416
What's your point?

59:47.417 --> 59:48.667
There isn't one.

59:50.250 --> 59:53.207
- There isn't?
- When I was 28 or so...

59:53.208 --> 59:54.832
- 28?
- That's right.

59:54.833 --> 59:56.957
- My hair?
- What about it?

59:56.958 --> 01:00:01.458
We're similar, you're shinier than me.

01:00:02.792 --> 01:00:04.792
What's taking so long?

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:09.500
A problem can't be diagnosed
and patched up quickly.

01:00:10.083 --> 01:00:13.957
Everything has to be
checked and double checked

01:00:13.958 --> 01:00:16.041
so that it doesn't happen again...

01:00:16.042 --> 01:00:17.250
It's done.

01:00:19.500 --> 01:00:24.000
But it's also self-explanatory
to an expert.

01:00:25.125 --> 01:00:26.750
Mr. Hairy, it's online.

01:00:26.792 --> 01:00:28.333
Okay, thank you.

01:00:41.542 --> 01:00:43.458
Cap, #1306.

01:00:49.417 --> 01:00:50.500
13th floor clear.

01:01:16.333 --> 01:01:17.499
It's Noh Joon-Young.

01:01:17.500 --> 01:01:18.500
You know him?

01:01:18.501 --> 01:01:20.374
He was the star of TV
show 'witch's boyfriend'.

01:01:20.375 --> 01:01:23.166
It was huge, so he's the hot shit now.

01:01:23.750 --> 01:01:26.541
So that's Noh's place?

01:01:26.958 --> 01:01:29.874
It's that one! The delivered case!

01:01:42.542 --> 01:01:44.749
Why is he dead in there?

01:01:44.750 --> 01:01:46.541
They transported a body?

01:01:46.833 --> 01:01:49.999
Life is so futile, he was a rising star.

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:51.500
Cap, we have a guest.

01:02:08.333 --> 01:02:10.041
What are they doing?

01:02:59.750 --> 01:03:01.541
Party prep is done.

01:03:40.583 --> 01:03:43.624
Covered in fingerprints, nails and saliva,

01:03:43.625 --> 01:03:47.041
it won't be easy to remove all evidence.

01:03:47.417 --> 01:03:50.291
I've put together a list of candidates.

01:03:50.292 --> 01:03:53.499
173 in total, unemployed and temps.

01:03:53.500 --> 01:03:56.082
Are you always so hasty?

01:03:56.083 --> 01:03:57.666
No need to hurry.

01:03:59.292 --> 01:04:02.291
Our team can work only
after the girl is chosen!

01:04:02.292 --> 01:04:03.999
I'm getting nonstop calls
from Chairman Chu!

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:05.625
Okay, okay, stop nagging.

01:04:08.417 --> 01:04:10.166
You know how this works,

01:04:10.167 --> 01:04:14.167
being out of work isn't the only criteria.

01:04:15.333 --> 01:04:16.499
Jeez...

01:05:12.667 --> 01:05:15.333
Let's backtrack Noh's steps.

01:05:15.583 --> 01:05:16.833
"Noh Joan-young"

01:05:38.250 --> 01:05:39.541
"Credit Card transactions"

01:05:46.250 --> 01:05:47.500
Boss?

01:05:48.125 --> 01:05:49.833
He spent a lot of time there.

01:05:55.708 --> 01:05:58.208
He was addicted to hostess bars?

01:06:01.375 --> 01:06:05.833
Alright, let's take a
look at the girls there.

01:06:18.708 --> 01:06:20.083
"Big Brother"

01:06:20.417 --> 01:06:21.583
"YPN Reporter Seo Ji-Seung"

01:06:22.208 --> 01:06:22.999
Hello?

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:24.957
I sent you a profile,

01:06:24.958 --> 01:06:27.374
put together a headline and a rough draft.

01:06:27.375 --> 01:06:28.750
Due tonight.

01:06:28.917 --> 01:06:31.499
That won't be easy, I
got other deadlines...

01:06:31.500 --> 01:06:32.500
What?

01:06:34.583 --> 01:06:35.833
You can't do it?

01:06:37.750 --> 01:06:40.582
Of course not. I'll get it done by...

01:06:40.583 --> 01:06:43.999
I'm paying you enough, just be thankful.

01:06:47.542 --> 01:06:49.041
Concept of this job is,

01:06:49.042 --> 01:06:53.542
"Celebrity stalking bar
girl's gruesome kill'."

01:06:54.875 --> 01:06:56.375
"Pureal Water Filter"

01:07:01.583 --> 01:07:02.833
who's there?

01:07:02.958 --> 01:07:05.791
I'm here to change the water filter.

01:07:06.125 --> 01:07:07.208
Okay.

01:07:26.667 --> 01:07:28.833
"Big Brother: Fingerprint data sent"

01:07:41.875 --> 01:07:44.041
"Medident Dental Laboratory"

01:08:03.667 --> 01:08:04.791
yes, Mr. Min.

01:08:04.792 --> 01:08:06.083
Ms. Lee.

01:08:06.208 --> 01:08:10.457
I need to pull someone out from prison.

01:08:10.458 --> 01:08:11.499
Asap.

01:08:12.833 --> 01:08:14.749
I dug into the owner of the condo,

01:08:14.750 --> 01:08:17.832
his name is Chu Sang-Duk,
Chairman of Hyosin group.

01:08:18.500 --> 01:08:22.082
Why does an actor die in
someone else's condo?

01:08:22.082 --> 01:08:23.166
I know.

01:08:23.542 --> 01:08:24.917
No quizzes.

01:08:27.500 --> 01:08:31.166
These are articles about Noh and Chu Ye-ri.

01:08:31.332 --> 01:08:32.374
Chu Ye-ri?

01:08:32.375 --> 01:08:33.832
Chairman Chu's child.

01:08:34.542 --> 01:08:37.499
The pieces are coming together.

01:08:37.500 --> 01:08:39.707
So that girl in the photo
is getting framed?

01:08:39.707 --> 01:08:40.624
I know!

01:08:40.625 --> 01:08:42.375
I said no quizzes.

01:08:46.167 --> 01:08:48.917
Mr. Hairy, can you find her?

01:08:49.417 --> 01:08:51.582
Do you see the print on this?

01:08:51.750 --> 01:08:54.791
They will go after her.

01:08:54.792 --> 01:08:56.082
I'll try.

01:09:09.917 --> 01:09:11.332
"Use Yu"

01:09:11.332 --> 01:09:12.999
"Park Hair Studio"

01:09:15.042 --> 01:09:16.332
that's pretty.

01:09:19.542 --> 01:09:21.292
How would you like it?

01:09:21.707 --> 01:09:24.166
As full looking as possible.

01:09:26.832 --> 01:09:28.582
Shampoo time.

01:09:28.582 --> 01:09:29.374
Okay.

01:09:42.042 --> 01:09:44.207
Cap, the bug is installed.

01:09:44.207 --> 01:09:45.082
Very good.

01:09:45.084 --> 01:09:46.166
How is it so easy?

01:09:46.167 --> 01:09:48.916
That's why you shouldn't click
on links in random texts.

01:09:48.917 --> 01:09:51.832
With one click, it's not
your phone anymore.

01:09:52.832 --> 01:09:54.624
You fucking bitch!

01:09:54.708 --> 01:09:56.291
Why aren't you answering me?

01:09:57.375 --> 01:09:59.624
Today's collection day, did you forget?

01:09:59.625 --> 01:10:01.416
- I'm sorry!
- Come here, bitch!

01:10:01.417 --> 01:10:03.542
Please give me a few more days!

01:10:04.208 --> 01:10:05.666
Give you a few more days?

01:10:05.667 --> 01:10:07.292
Fucking bitch!

01:10:07.458 --> 01:10:10.249
You don't answer me, don't pay me back!

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:14.583
What are you looking at? Having fun?

01:10:14.875 --> 01:10:17.500
Sell your kidney if you have to!

01:10:18.458 --> 01:10:20.083
You don't deserve...

01:10:21.958 --> 01:10:23.124
Let me go!

01:10:26.375 --> 01:10:28.125
Who the fuck are you!

01:10:31.875 --> 01:10:33.666
I sent it last week.

01:10:36.708 --> 01:10:37.666
What?

01:10:37.917 --> 01:10:39.250
No way!

01:10:39.542 --> 01:10:42.541
I have no more money to send him!

01:10:42.542 --> 01:10:45.582
If he need the money, go rob a house!

01:10:45.583 --> 01:10:49.124
How could you say that about your brother?

01:10:49.125 --> 01:10:52.207
You're being high and mighty
for sending a few bucks.

01:10:52.208 --> 01:10:53.332
You bitch!

01:10:53.333 --> 01:10:54.333
Mom...

01:10:55.708 --> 01:10:58.208
Do you know how I earned that money?

01:10:58.583 --> 01:11:00.374
Don't call me again.

01:11:00.375 --> 01:11:02.666
I'm at my breaking point!

01:11:21.792 --> 01:11:23.917
"Mr. Hairy"

01:11:25.708 --> 01:11:27.291
stayed up all night?

01:11:27.583 --> 01:11:29.208
Want breakfast?

01:11:30.708 --> 01:11:33.458
It's okay, after they wake up.

01:11:35.125 --> 01:11:37.583
You're still a fugitive,

01:11:38.250 --> 01:11:41.000
you can't get in other people's affairs.

01:11:42.625 --> 01:11:44.582
Mr. Hairy, you're the one,

01:11:44.583 --> 01:11:46.333
who helped my mom, right?

01:11:46.875 --> 01:11:48.166
Yeo-Wool.

01:11:49.500 --> 01:11:51.041
That's my name.

01:11:51.917 --> 01:11:53.083
Hello?

01:11:53.125 --> 01:11:55.875
Hi, I found a wallet.

01:11:56.917 --> 01:11:58.541
I'll pay you $300.

01:11:58.542 --> 01:12:00.542
It's on my bed upstairs.

01:12:00.708 --> 01:12:02.874
I found this number in the wallet.

01:12:02.875 --> 01:12:04.125
It's her.

01:12:05.667 --> 01:12:08.375
The woman who called me.

01:12:08.917 --> 01:12:13.375
Heard of Pentaportra Condo
in Cheongdam District?

01:12:13.917 --> 01:12:16.875
Yes, if you come here,
I'll return it to you.

01:12:17.125 --> 01:12:19.041
Thank you so much, I'll come right away.

01:12:19.042 --> 01:12:19.875
Okay.

01:12:19.876 --> 01:12:22.291
She used the same method to lure me.

01:12:22.292 --> 01:12:23.582
We just have to catch her.

01:12:23.583 --> 01:12:24.624
"Baiting Complete."

01:12:30.958 --> 01:12:32.458
I need 3 minutes.

01:12:36.917 --> 01:12:39.625
Yes, how can I help you?

01:12:40.875 --> 01:12:41.833
Hello?

01:12:41.834 --> 01:12:44.541
Let me go, you fucking quacks!

01:12:44.583 --> 01:12:45.624
Hello?

01:12:47.875 --> 01:12:48.583
It wasn't my son!

01:12:48.584 --> 01:12:50.999
Life imprisonment without parole.

01:12:52.333 --> 01:12:53.458
Hello?

01:12:54.750 --> 01:12:56.666
Are you there? Hello?

01:12:59.917 --> 01:13:01.500
What the shit...

01:13:02.333 --> 01:13:05.708
Hello? You must be tired.

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:08.832
I understand what you're trying to do.

01:13:08.833 --> 01:13:12.791
Yo, perv, you like
breathing into the phone?

01:13:12.792 --> 01:13:15.124
Goddamn right, did you call me a perv?

01:13:15.125 --> 01:13:18.874
I'll slash your tummy
until intestines spill out.

01:13:18.875 --> 01:13:20.125
Slash...

01:13:21.208 --> 01:13:22.291
Oh man...

01:13:23.042 --> 01:13:24.791
You crazy fuck,

01:13:24.792 --> 01:13:26.416
are you really that bored?

01:13:26.417 --> 01:13:27.749
You're a bum, right?

01:13:27.750 --> 01:13:29.166
You're a freeloader, I can tell, dipshit.

01:13:29.167 --> 01:13:33.667
So a freeloader can't even make a call?
You whore!

01:13:33.917 --> 01:13:34.833
I'm sorry, mommy.

01:13:34.834 --> 01:13:38.374
I just wanna fuck, is that so much to ask?

01:13:39.292 --> 01:13:41.832
Are you turned on by my dirty mouth?

01:13:41.833 --> 01:13:44.457
So dirty talk turns you on, huh?

01:13:44.458 --> 01:13:47.124
You're the real perv, you won me over.

01:13:47.125 --> 01:13:49.416
Dear valued perverted client,

01:13:49.417 --> 01:13:52.207
get a handjob if you're in heat,
this isn't the sex hotline.

01:13:52.208 --> 01:13:56.708
You're a nasty hoe, fuck off, cumslut!

01:13:56.750 --> 01:13:57.708
Hello?

01:14:06.500 --> 01:14:07.833
It's done.

01:14:15.500 --> 01:14:17.916
Hello? Is this Mr. Bae Young-Deuk?

01:14:17.917 --> 01:14:19.874
It's Goryeo resources.

01:14:19.875 --> 01:14:23.249
We have an opening
for night construction shift.

01:14:23.250 --> 01:14:24.916
Are you available?

01:14:25.167 --> 01:14:26.042
Yes.

01:14:31.375 --> 01:14:34.583
You're exposed, go off the grid.

01:14:35.333 --> 01:14:36.999
It's him! Right?

01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:39.708
It's the fugitive, call the Police!

01:15:25.792 --> 01:15:28.625
What the shit! Move this truck!

01:15:28.875 --> 01:15:30.124
I'm so sorry!

01:15:30.125 --> 01:15:32.458
Back off at once!

01:15:33.458 --> 01:15:35.041
Yo, rapist!

01:15:35.750 --> 01:15:37.541
Been a while, Mofo!

01:15:40.833 --> 01:15:42.291
He's coming to.

01:15:42.292 --> 01:15:43.750
- Pull him up.
- Yes, Boss.

01:15:43.833 --> 01:15:45.791
Don't resist.

01:15:47.917 --> 01:15:50.124
Aren't you curious how I got out?

01:15:50.125 --> 01:15:51.666
Fuck, I'm curious too.

01:15:52.458 --> 01:15:54.791
Remember this? You shot me with this.

01:15:55.417 --> 01:15:56.625
Here it comes.

01:16:03.125 --> 01:16:03.916
Holy shit!

01:16:03.917 --> 01:16:05.332
Fuck, look at that bastard go.

01:16:05.333 --> 01:16:06.291
Hold him.

01:16:10.417 --> 01:16:12.208
Kwon Yu, here it comes.

01:16:29.667 --> 01:16:32.333
Give me the knife, I wanna cut his mouth.

01:16:39.625 --> 01:16:43.875
I'll widen your hole and bury you properly,

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:45.875
so rest in peace, okay?

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:47.583
Fugitive Kwon Yu!

01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:52.457
I'm calling while the
fugitive is out of sight,

01:16:52.458 --> 01:16:54.124
please save me.

01:16:54.125 --> 01:16:58.625
We'll rescue you shortly,
so please be calm.

01:16:59.917 --> 01:17:00.875
Boss?

01:17:00.917 --> 01:17:03.416
The cops want this bastard.

01:17:03.417 --> 01:17:04.333
Don't mind them.

01:17:04.334 --> 01:17:06.333
The guy who got me out
will take take of it.

01:17:06.792 --> 01:17:09.875
"Office manager Ms. Lee"
Ms. Lee, we got one more task.

01:17:09.917 --> 01:17:11.499
Don't take any unnecessary actions.

01:17:11.500 --> 01:17:13.750
- Chief, chief!
- We'll move in shortly.

01:17:14.417 --> 01:17:16.208
The HQ ordered us to withdrawal.

01:17:16.625 --> 01:17:18.541
What do you mean? We got
a hostage in there.

01:17:18.708 --> 01:17:20.082
I'm not sure, that was the order.

01:17:20.083 --> 01:17:21.707
Officer! Please!

01:17:21.708 --> 01:17:25.166
He's trying to kill me, please help me!

01:17:27.458 --> 01:17:29.749
Get in here, you fucking idiots!

01:17:29.750 --> 01:17:31.416
Execute! Execute!

01:17:33.083 --> 01:17:34.791
- What's that?
- What's going on?

01:17:48.083 --> 01:17:49.291
We surrender!

01:17:49.458 --> 01:17:51.874
- We're allies.
- Who are they?

01:17:51.875 --> 01:17:53.416
We're on the same side.

01:18:08.250 --> 01:18:10.500
Get in! Quick!

01:18:14.833 --> 01:18:16.083
What happened?

01:18:16.708 --> 01:18:19.208
You left this in the middle of the road.

01:18:20.042 --> 01:18:21.042
Thanks!

01:18:21.167 --> 01:18:22.332
What's with the driving?

01:18:22.333 --> 01:18:23.541
I don't have a license.

01:18:23.542 --> 01:18:24.167
What?

01:18:24.208 --> 01:18:25.458
No license!

01:18:27.333 --> 01:18:29.166
Switch, I'll drive!

01:18:43.125 --> 01:18:44.291
By the way.

01:18:45.542 --> 01:18:47.583
How did the cops know my location?

01:18:52.917 --> 01:18:54.917
Yo, buddy!

01:18:55.750 --> 01:18:57.457
Match the speed, fuckface!

01:18:57.458 --> 01:18:59.916
Stop the car, bitch!

01:19:00.417 --> 01:19:02.667
Let's work on your hole!

01:19:03.875 --> 01:19:06.833
He's been on my ass like a Hounddog.

01:19:08.708 --> 01:19:11.041
Asshole! Turn this car around!

01:19:11.042 --> 01:19:12.207
Turn it around!

01:19:12.208 --> 01:19:14.707
Boss, we're on a ramp...

01:19:14.708 --> 01:19:16.874
Turn it around, fucker!

01:19:20.208 --> 01:19:21.249
What's that?

01:19:21.250 --> 01:19:22.708
Radio detector.

01:19:23.208 --> 01:19:24.916
Yong Guru made it.

01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:33.707
Why is that in there?

01:19:33.708 --> 01:19:34.999
Wait, wait!

01:19:35.292 --> 01:19:36.500
Please.

01:20:01.208 --> 01:20:05.624
We lost his signal there,
so search thoroughly.

01:20:05.625 --> 01:20:09.666
Once you catch Kwon, you'll be a free man.

01:20:09.667 --> 01:20:12.707
So you got me out of the
joint to bury Kwon.

01:20:12.708 --> 01:20:14.499
You must be a powerful...

01:20:14.500 --> 01:20:16.791
Focus on catching Kwon.

01:20:16.792 --> 01:20:19.917
Or you'll be sent back to the joint.

01:20:21.292 --> 01:20:22.332
He hung up on me?

01:20:22.333 --> 01:20:24.832
So he gave you her necklace,

01:20:24.833 --> 01:20:27.832
but it contained a location tracker?

01:20:27.833 --> 01:20:32.333
And those gangsters were
supposed to be in prison?

01:20:32.917 --> 01:20:36.250
Without Mr. Hairy,
Cap could've been in a grave.

01:20:37.625 --> 01:20:39.708
So who really is that lawyer?

01:20:41.458 --> 01:20:45.041
Shouldn't we go after the lawyer first?

01:20:45.042 --> 01:20:46.792
Yong Guru,

01:20:47.625 --> 01:20:49.625
can you make drones?

01:20:50.250 --> 01:20:51.416
Drone?

01:21:01.500 --> 01:21:03.041
So, how's the feed?

01:21:03.292 --> 01:21:04.708
Good, very clear.

01:21:05.708 --> 01:21:06.958
Oh, wait.

01:21:07.833 --> 01:21:10.457
Leather jacket, is that new?

01:21:10.458 --> 01:21:12.541
Mr. Hairy bought it for me...

01:21:15.375 --> 01:21:16.375
Yeah?

01:21:17.792 --> 01:21:20.458
Yong's pretty amazing at this.

01:21:20.667 --> 01:21:22.292
Yong Guru, you're awesome.

01:21:22.500 --> 01:21:26.375
I can't believe this guy is unemployed.

01:21:26.875 --> 01:21:28.500
That leather smell...

01:21:28.542 --> 01:21:32.000
My dad beat me up for
fooling around like this.

01:21:33.417 --> 01:21:35.124
"Attorney Min Chum-Sang"

01:21:35.125 --> 01:21:37.082
I reviewed the raised estimate,

01:21:37.083 --> 01:21:40.041
and transferred the money
to the operatives.

01:21:40.042 --> 01:21:41.583
Okay, good work.

01:21:41.667 --> 01:21:43.999
We can hear what they're
saying in the office?

01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:47.332
It's using laser to detect soundwaves.

01:21:47.333 --> 01:21:48.749
That's the standard now.

01:21:50.583 --> 01:21:53.124
We completed your request.

01:21:53.125 --> 01:21:55.374
All leaked documents are destroyed,

01:21:55.375 --> 01:21:58.750
and related data are
stored securely for insurance.

01:21:59.333 --> 01:22:01.583
You know about Kwon Yu's escape, right?

01:22:01.917 --> 01:22:03.791
He already came here for a visit.

01:22:03.792 --> 01:22:07.082
Take care of it before
it becomes a problem.

01:22:07.083 --> 01:22:11.583
Min is more capable than we imagined.

01:22:11.958 --> 01:22:14.791
Please calm the board for me.

01:22:14.792 --> 01:22:18.291
Long conversation could be compromising.

01:22:18.292 --> 01:22:20.333
See you at the meeting.

01:22:24.042 --> 01:22:26.042
"Attorney Min Chum-Sang"

01:22:26.667 --> 01:22:29.208
so that idiot is the puppet master?

01:22:30.125 --> 01:22:33.832
How could he mastermind it
in a beat-up office like that?

01:22:33.833 --> 01:22:38.124
He needs a massive server farm,
that place looks unlikely.

01:22:38.125 --> 01:22:40.374
Maybe they have one off-site.

01:22:40.375 --> 01:22:42.250
Yong, did you bring the metal scanner?

01:22:42.583 --> 01:22:44.124
Send in another drone.

01:22:44.792 --> 01:22:46.583
Let's scan the building.

01:22:56.375 --> 01:22:58.791
Shit, it's embedded in there?

01:23:00.125 --> 01:23:01.875
It's like a huge safe.

01:23:02.417 --> 01:23:04.332
If they built a fortress,

01:23:04.333 --> 01:23:08.124
that means they got secrets
they want to protect, right?

01:23:08.583 --> 01:23:12.082
Can't Mr. Hairy hack the place?

01:23:12.083 --> 01:23:16.541
You could take over the
PC like you did to us.

01:23:16.542 --> 01:23:20.457
I've been trying,
but I can't penetrate the firewall.

01:23:20.458 --> 01:23:21.749
Dammit.

01:23:21.750 --> 01:23:24.499
Everything'd be solved once we're inside.

01:23:24.500 --> 01:23:26.166
Negative, got any ideas?

01:23:26.167 --> 01:23:30.667
No one can get inside
unless someone opens the door.

01:23:31.042 --> 01:23:32.624
Let's just call the cops.

01:23:32.625 --> 01:23:33.832
What if they're on their side?

01:23:33.833 --> 01:23:35.624
Then get the media involved.

01:23:35.625 --> 01:23:39.832
Did Mr. Hairy's video get any air time?

01:23:39.833 --> 01:23:44.333
She's in hiding because that
put her on a watchlist.

01:23:48.042 --> 01:23:49.542
I have an idea.

01:24:02.667 --> 01:24:03.833
Hello?

01:24:03.917 --> 01:24:06.207
We got a problem.

01:24:06.208 --> 01:24:06.916
What is it?

01:24:06.917 --> 01:24:09.167
Noh's apartment was vandalized.

01:24:14.750 --> 01:24:17.041
"You're finished, Min Chun-Sang"

01:24:19.167 --> 01:24:21.374
they wiped all fingerprints,

01:24:21.375 --> 01:24:23.832
and mixed various hair samples.

01:24:23.833 --> 01:24:26.416
We can't tell which belongs to so.

01:24:29.167 --> 01:24:30.667
He's good.

01:24:31.667 --> 01:24:33.457
How could you laugh?

01:24:33.458 --> 01:24:35.624
The news will be out tomorrow.

01:24:35.958 --> 01:24:37.166
What now?

01:24:37.917 --> 01:24:39.833
Let's push back the d-day.

01:24:40.250 --> 01:24:43.458
Get the operatives to wipe this place down.

01:24:50.833 --> 01:24:53.624
Send Noh's body to somewhere quiet.

01:24:53.792 --> 01:24:55.624
A motel in the country, perhaps.

01:24:55.625 --> 01:24:59.041
And collect so's samples again.

01:24:59.042 --> 01:25:03.207
Dad, any updates from that min bastard?

01:25:03.208 --> 01:25:04.582
How long must I stay here?

01:25:04.583 --> 01:25:07.624
The food is shit and I
can't bear the stench!

01:25:07.833 --> 01:25:08.999
Min Chum-Sang!

01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:11.332
- Is this how you work?
- Chairman Chu!

01:25:11.333 --> 01:25:13.874
Do you know how much pain
my child is in right now!

01:25:13.875 --> 01:25:16.125
I raised her like a Princess.

01:25:18.375 --> 01:25:20.416
We're all working day and night,

01:25:20.417 --> 01:25:22.292
so please be patient with us.

01:25:22.417 --> 01:25:24.083
Pay me back! Answer me!

01:25:24.500 --> 01:25:25.916
Give me my money!

01:25:25.917 --> 01:25:27.458
Fucking hell...

01:25:30.625 --> 01:25:33.375
What the hell, everything pisses me off.

01:25:35.417 --> 01:25:37.167
Who the fuck!

01:25:38.125 --> 01:25:39.583
Okay, try it.

01:25:52.042 --> 01:25:53.875
One, two, three!

01:25:54.542 --> 01:25:56.583
"Party and event planners"

01:25:59.417 --> 01:26:00.875
"we know what you're doing"

01:26:01.333 --> 01:26:02.499
"what the hell!"

01:26:39.542 --> 01:26:42.375
Son of a bitch! Stop it! Please!

01:26:47.500 --> 01:26:50.082
Kwon Yu is going after
all of our operatives.

01:26:50.083 --> 01:26:53.541
We can hire new people.

01:26:53.542 --> 01:26:56.916
Do you want Chu's nagging to continue?

01:26:56.917 --> 01:27:00.125
Let's finish the so job first.

01:27:00.458 --> 01:27:01.749
No need to worry about Kwon,

01:27:01.750 --> 01:27:04.416
I have him under control.

01:27:04.417 --> 01:27:06.083
It's time for the news.

01:27:09.500 --> 01:27:10.707
Let's watch together.

01:27:10.708 --> 01:27:13.083
I'm here at an unmanned motel in Yesan.

01:27:13.333 --> 01:27:16.082
"Actor Noh Joon-Young's body found in a
motel" after a week-long disappearance,

01:27:16.083 --> 01:27:19.624
we received a tip that
Noh Joan-young was murdered.

01:27:19.625 --> 01:27:21.416
The forensics unit is on the scene...

01:27:25.583 --> 01:27:27.999
You can't come in here!

01:27:28.417 --> 01:27:29.958
Move aside! Move!

01:27:34.333 --> 01:27:36.083
It's Chu Ye-ri! Chu Ye-ri!

01:27:36.375 --> 01:27:37.833
Take the picture!

01:27:41.417 --> 01:27:44.917
"Actor Noh Joon-Young's
body found in a motel"

01:27:46.333 --> 01:27:48.332
how long must I stay here?

01:27:48.333 --> 01:27:51.374
The food is shit and I
can't bear the stench!

01:27:58.458 --> 01:28:01.124
Chu Ye-ri, the daughter of
Hyosin group Chairman Chu,

01:28:01.125 --> 01:28:05.625
was found at the crime scene
and was arrested for killing Noh.

01:28:06.958 --> 01:28:10.707
What the hell's going on!
Why was my daughter there!

01:28:10.708 --> 01:28:12.041
Difficult to deny charges.

01:28:12.042 --> 01:28:16.082
Facing a tidal wave of criticisms,
Chairman Chu is confronting

01:28:16.083 --> 01:28:18.749
the greatest threat of his life.

01:28:19.125 --> 01:28:21.125
"Unknown Caller"

01:28:30.875 --> 01:28:31.833
Kwon Yu?

01:28:31.834 --> 01:28:33.291
How did you like it?

01:28:33.792 --> 01:28:36.083
I copied your method.

01:28:36.833 --> 01:28:39.416
Good, that was quite amazing.

01:28:39.417 --> 01:28:42.250
It's weird to be complimented by
someone I want to kill.

01:28:42.542 --> 01:28:47.042
That's the truth,
it's been pretty dull recently.

01:28:48.833 --> 01:28:51.166
I got a surge of motivation,
it's turning me on!

01:28:51.167 --> 01:28:53.292
It's been a long time.

01:28:53.417 --> 01:28:55.333
Can you understand that?

01:28:55.917 --> 01:28:59.208
This was quite fun in the beginning.

01:28:59.292 --> 01:29:03.792
People would go to jail
based on the scenarios I created,

01:29:05.125 --> 01:29:09.625
and with an article I
wrote, people'd laugh,

01:29:11.542 --> 01:29:15.416
or cry, or get enraged.

01:29:15.417 --> 01:29:17.542
The sense of accomplishment...

01:29:22.458 --> 01:29:26.332
So what, it's still a job
and it gets dull after a while.

01:29:26.333 --> 01:29:27.874
Everything's the same.

01:29:32.375 --> 01:29:35.291
But I'm ecstatic lately.

01:29:35.917 --> 01:29:37.708
You're a threat.

01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:41.666
No one has ever challenged me before,

01:29:41.667 --> 01:29:44.582
but when you come after me,

01:29:44.583 --> 01:29:48.416
it pisses me off, but
it also feels amazing!

01:29:52.083 --> 01:29:53.041
Hello?

01:30:09.083 --> 01:30:13.166
How dare he hang up when I'm talking.

01:30:13.500 --> 01:30:15.041
He hung up...

01:30:16.542 --> 01:30:18.417
What a douchebag.

01:30:21.500 --> 01:30:23.125
This is the problem.

01:30:24.250 --> 01:30:28.208
Can't communicate with the millennials.

01:30:28.417 --> 01:30:30.083
It's quite serious.

01:30:31.125 --> 01:30:32.374
Stupid millennials!

01:30:32.375 --> 01:30:34.791
I didn't ask for much! Did I!

01:30:35.042 --> 01:30:38.249
I was talking on the phone!

01:30:38.250 --> 01:30:39.666
Can't communicate!

01:30:39.667 --> 01:30:42.792
Can't get through to them.

01:31:47.417 --> 01:31:50.000
That hurts, really badly.

01:31:53.917 --> 01:31:55.792
That really hurts...

01:32:26.792 --> 01:32:28.833
Are you still asleep?

01:32:31.917 --> 01:32:32.833
Get up!

01:32:32.834 --> 01:32:34.999
Were you up all night playing games?

01:32:35.458 --> 01:32:36.541
How about a Dojo?

01:32:36.583 --> 01:32:38.166
No more taekwondo.

01:32:39.208 --> 01:32:40.666
I'll set it up for you.

01:32:41.000 --> 01:32:42.958
I'll never practice taekwondo ever again.

01:32:45.542 --> 01:32:48.582
Please read this, my son is not a killer!

01:32:48.583 --> 01:32:50.208
Please read this.

01:32:50.292 --> 01:32:51.541
Isn't that fun?

01:32:51.542 --> 01:32:53.250
Please read this!

01:32:53.583 --> 01:32:56.208
It gets better towards the end.

01:32:56.833 --> 01:32:59.499
Oh, and sorry for killing your mom.

01:33:00.958 --> 01:33:04.249
I know it's late, but I apologize.

01:33:12.292 --> 01:33:14.875
Be cool and listen to me...

01:33:15.083 --> 01:33:16.249
Listen to me...

01:33:16.542 --> 01:33:17.792
It's important...

01:33:17.917 --> 01:33:18.917
Wait! Wait!

01:33:19.042 --> 01:33:21.166
It's really important, you might regret...

01:33:21.167 --> 01:33:22.125
Hey!

01:33:24.375 --> 01:33:26.250
Know why this happened to you?

01:33:26.333 --> 01:33:28.874
You were born to terrible parents.

01:33:30.250 --> 01:33:31.833
Son of a bitch!

01:33:32.458 --> 01:33:34.583
Fucking bastard!

01:33:45.667 --> 01:33:48.292
I know you feel wronged.

01:33:48.625 --> 01:33:53.125
But that doesn't excuse you
from hitting an older man.

01:33:55.625 --> 01:33:56.833
You psycho...

01:33:57.042 --> 01:33:59.208
Anyway, it's almost time.

01:34:00.667 --> 01:34:02.083
"Mr. Hairy"

01:34:03.333 --> 01:34:04.916
you should answer.

01:34:09.792 --> 01:34:12.207
Yeo-Wool? Hello?

01:34:12.208 --> 01:34:15.041
Yo dipshit! Let's meet again!

01:34:16.042 --> 01:34:17.832
Team name:: Resurrection.

01:34:17.833 --> 01:34:22.333
Yong Guru, demolition, negative-space,

01:34:22.708 --> 01:34:23.874
and Mr. Hairy.

01:34:23.917 --> 01:34:27.292
They'll all die because of you.

01:34:27.750 --> 01:34:28.791
I...

01:34:31.333 --> 01:34:35.666
If you touch them, I
will kill you, asshole!

01:34:36.000 --> 01:34:40.000
Sorry for returning a threat with a threat,

01:34:40.208 --> 01:34:43.416
but if you keep this up, they'll all die.

01:34:46.167 --> 01:34:48.042
I think my ribs are broken.

01:34:48.500 --> 01:34:51.041
I knew you'd come to steal my data.

01:34:51.042 --> 01:34:54.500
That's why I sent ma after your team.

01:34:54.708 --> 01:34:58.249
The server is huge,
it'll take about 30 minutes.

01:34:58.625 --> 01:35:03.125
But you'll be a free man with that, though.

01:35:05.667 --> 01:35:10.167
But your friends will die like dogs.

01:35:11.625 --> 01:35:13.291
Too bad about that.

01:35:15.750 --> 01:35:19.708
I will kill you and rescue my teammates.

01:35:22.125 --> 01:35:24.833
I feel for your determination,

01:35:28.292 --> 01:35:32.791
but I told ma that if I
don't call him in 15,

01:35:32.792 --> 01:35:35.542
they should be executed.

01:35:35.875 --> 01:35:37.875
Maybe I shouldn't have.

01:35:38.417 --> 01:35:40.667
Just get the data.

01:35:41.083 --> 01:35:42.999
You escaped to clear your name,

01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:45.875
shouldn't you be on that?

01:35:49.833 --> 01:35:51.958
Forget them.

01:35:52.708 --> 01:35:56.541
No one cares if they die.

01:35:56.625 --> 01:35:58.000
They all eventually die...

01:36:07.708 --> 01:36:10.999
I forgot to mention something else, sorry.

01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:14.791
That friend of yours, Mr. Hairy.

01:36:15.333 --> 01:36:16.791
Yoon Yea-Wool.

01:36:19.583 --> 01:36:21.457
She'll be so's replacement.

01:36:21.458 --> 01:36:25.708
My men should be gathering
her samples by now.

01:36:27.500 --> 01:36:28.957
Mr. Hairy!

01:36:28.958 --> 01:36:33.458
Hermit hacker murders popular actor Noh'.

01:36:34.375 --> 01:36:37.958
The news will hit the web in the morning.

01:36:38.208 --> 01:36:39.624
Pretty cool, huh?

01:36:41.833 --> 01:36:42.999
I might be a genius.

01:36:43.458 --> 01:36:47.082
Stop, just stop it, asshole!

01:36:47.083 --> 01:36:50.416
And your remaining friends,

01:36:50.583 --> 01:36:54.624
I ordered ma to kill them just now.

01:36:55.333 --> 01:36:58.749
They'll be dead by the time you arrive,

01:36:58.750 --> 01:36:59.874
so just skip town.

01:36:59.875 --> 01:37:03.749
You'll arrive in time
to feel their cold bodies.

01:37:03.750 --> 01:37:06.708
Don't do it! Son of a bitch!

01:37:06.958 --> 01:37:08.499
Fuck!

01:37:09.708 --> 01:37:12.249
You shouldn't have touched me.

01:37:12.708 --> 01:37:14.083
Motherfucker!

01:37:17.833 --> 01:37:20.583
Do you know why you'll die?

01:37:21.875 --> 01:37:23.708
Who should I kill first?

01:37:25.167 --> 01:37:26.667
Wait, please!

01:37:26.875 --> 01:37:28.250
Old man, you first.

01:37:36.292 --> 01:37:38.708
Negative!

01:37:39.500 --> 01:37:40.708
He's not dead?

01:37:41.000 --> 01:37:42.125
What's with this?

01:37:42.375 --> 01:37:45.958
Wait! Let's talk! We can sort this out!

01:37:50.167 --> 01:37:51.666
Is this defective?

01:37:51.667 --> 01:37:53.875
You never served in the military.

01:37:58.042 --> 01:37:58.875
Hot!

01:38:00.292 --> 01:38:02.250
- Mr. Hairy!
- Get rid of her.

01:38:03.750 --> 01:38:05.625
Get her outta here!

01:38:05.875 --> 01:38:07.707
Don't do it! Fucking bastards!

01:38:07.708 --> 01:38:08.958
Give me your gun.

01:38:13.458 --> 01:38:14.208
Idiot!

01:38:14.209 --> 01:38:15.958
Wait! Please!

01:38:16.417 --> 01:38:20.917
Talk! Let's talk! Don't shoot me!

01:38:21.500 --> 01:38:23.666
We can talk about this!

01:38:23.667 --> 01:38:26.541
Look at me! You fugly piece of shit!

01:38:26.542 --> 01:38:28.874
Look at me! You fuck!

01:38:28.875 --> 01:38:32.499
Don't shoot! Don't do it! Asshole!

01:38:32.500 --> 01:38:35.083
I can't concentrate! Shut the hell up!

01:38:35.250 --> 01:38:36.666
You wanna die first?

01:38:37.708 --> 01:38:39.708
I have a mother...

01:38:40.667 --> 01:38:41.625
Okay.

01:38:42.250 --> 01:38:43.666
You still die first.

01:38:43.667 --> 01:38:45.958
Wait, wait, mister, please just wait!

01:38:46.083 --> 01:38:49.208
What happened? What's going on!

01:38:49.250 --> 01:38:51.041
I think it's a blackout.

01:38:51.042 --> 01:38:53.292
Fuck, blackout!

01:38:53.833 --> 01:38:55.291
Boss! There!

01:38:56.708 --> 01:38:59.958
Stop! Stop shooting! Motherfucker!

01:39:00.250 --> 01:39:01.833
Hey! Stop shooting!

01:39:02.000 --> 01:39:03.416
Light your lighter!

01:39:14.500 --> 01:39:15.666
Is he dead?

01:39:17.125 --> 01:39:18.208
Did you find him?

01:40:47.833 --> 01:40:49.499
Hurry! Hurry!

01:40:49.708 --> 01:40:51.124
Negative, hurry!

01:40:53.458 --> 01:40:54.541
Stop right there!

01:40:54.625 --> 01:40:57.625
Get him, the one in leather jacket!

01:41:02.250 --> 01:41:03.458
Stop!

01:41:07.458 --> 01:41:08.833
Faster! Faster!

01:41:15.667 --> 01:41:16.333
Go after them!

01:41:16.417 --> 01:41:17.875
Get them!

01:41:21.042 --> 01:41:22.750
They're coming!

01:41:24.625 --> 01:41:27.750
Why are they fleeing?
He fights so fucking well!

01:41:32.958 --> 01:41:34.416
Car in front!

01:41:40.750 --> 01:41:43.750
It's too narrow! No way! Stop!

01:41:49.583 --> 01:41:51.416
Let's go!

01:41:57.833 --> 01:41:59.166
Goddammit!

01:42:00.583 --> 01:42:02.624
That's the best you can do?

01:42:02.625 --> 01:42:05.207
Give Yong-pal a call!

01:42:05.208 --> 01:42:05.791
What?

01:42:05.792 --> 01:42:08.082
Get Yong-pal, fuckface!

01:42:08.083 --> 01:42:09.374
Get the car!

01:42:09.917 --> 01:42:11.666
Hey, ma!

01:42:11.667 --> 01:42:14.707
I'll send you Kwon Yu's location,

01:42:14.708 --> 01:42:17.624
so please get him, I'm begging you!

01:42:29.917 --> 01:42:32.166
Boss! I'm here!

01:42:32.167 --> 01:42:34.292
Yong-pal to the rescue!

01:42:34.750 --> 01:42:37.291
I'm gonna get you no matter what!

01:42:49.833 --> 01:42:51.208
That looks fun.

01:42:52.333 --> 01:42:54.916
Why don't I give him a hand?

01:43:00.833 --> 01:43:02.708
It's the foul mouth.

01:43:05.667 --> 01:43:06.292
What the hell?

01:43:06.293 --> 01:43:08.667
How about a roller coaster ride?

01:43:18.625 --> 01:43:20.625
Yong-pal, go! Go!

01:43:20.708 --> 01:43:22.166
Go! Go!

01:43:31.042 --> 01:43:32.542
There, there!

01:43:53.875 --> 01:43:55.666
Careful, careful!

01:44:19.875 --> 01:44:21.333
Where am I?

01:44:29.500 --> 01:44:31.166
What are those!

01:44:33.958 --> 01:44:35.374
Get that bastard.

01:44:35.500 --> 01:44:36.916
Got it?

01:44:36.917 --> 01:44:38.583
Get that bastard! Dammit!

01:45:09.167 --> 01:45:10.666
Is this the TV station?

01:45:10.667 --> 01:45:12.875
I'd like to report a tip.

01:45:12.958 --> 01:45:15.874
It's about fugitive Kwon Yu...

01:45:24.292 --> 01:45:27.583
Is that fucker really trying to kill us?

01:45:32.083 --> 01:45:35.166
I feel so terrible.

01:45:36.792 --> 01:45:38.708
Almost time for news.

01:45:43.167 --> 01:45:44.500
Son of a bitch.

01:45:45.083 --> 01:45:46.332
- Breaking news!
- Newsflash!

01:45:46.333 --> 01:45:48.124
- This just in!
- Identity of Noh's killer...

01:45:48.125 --> 01:45:51.291
fugitive Kwon Yu

01:45:51.292 --> 01:45:52.957
"Kwon Yu, murders Noh, kidnaps Chu Ye-ri"
was found to be real killer.

01:45:52.958 --> 01:45:57.458
The CCTV footages secured by
the Police show Kwon Yu

01:45:58.292 --> 01:46:01.999
and his followers known as 'resurrection'

01:46:02.000 --> 01:46:04.666
kidnapping and moving Chu Ye-ri
to the crime scene.

01:46:04.667 --> 01:46:07.207
The problem is the ragtag group.

01:46:07.208 --> 01:46:08.916
"Kwon Yu followers assisted killing"
indulged in violent games...

01:46:08.917 --> 01:46:10.249
Homemade bombs...

01:46:10.250 --> 01:46:14.749
a psychotic crime ring
that is on a crime spree.

01:46:14.750 --> 01:46:17.750
They called us a psychotic crime ring.

01:46:18.292 --> 01:46:20.416
Dammit! Now the Police are on us!

01:46:20.417 --> 01:46:21.917
It's getting more serious.

01:46:22.042 --> 01:46:23.624
Get him before the cops do!

01:46:23.625 --> 01:46:25.958
A large reward to whoever gets him!

01:46:28.208 --> 01:46:32.374
Kwon Yu, so you're a game addict?

01:46:32.792 --> 01:46:34.333
"Chairman Chu"

01:46:35.708 --> 01:46:39.041
Mr. Min, I knew you'd pull it off!

01:46:39.125 --> 01:46:41.041
You're a genius!

01:46:46.750 --> 01:46:48.832
Are we gonna be okay?

01:46:48.833 --> 01:46:49.874
We're almost there.

01:46:54.750 --> 01:46:57.416
While fugitive Kwon was incarcerated,

01:46:57.417 --> 01:47:01.917
he was known
to regularly assault fellow inmates.

01:47:02.083 --> 01:47:04.374
Perhaps our society has created a monster,

01:47:05.042 --> 01:47:09.542
"revenge killing, are we safe?"
We must look back at...

01:47:18.000 --> 01:47:19.250
Did you get that?

01:47:21.292 --> 01:47:22.208
Cars are coming in here!

01:47:22.209 --> 01:47:23.958
2 towing trucks are rushing in!

01:47:36.000 --> 01:47:38.666
Yeo-Wool got off, fetch her.

01:47:38.667 --> 01:47:39.874
The girl's yeo-wool, okay?

01:47:39.875 --> 01:47:42.041
This is your last chance.

01:47:42.042 --> 01:47:43.124
Buddy, I'm busy, I will...

01:47:43.125 --> 01:47:44.708
Fuck, he hung up again?

01:47:45.292 --> 01:47:47.000
He's got bad manners!

01:47:50.833 --> 01:47:52.333
Okay, let's go!

01:47:54.208 --> 01:47:55.166
Attention please.

01:47:55.167 --> 01:47:59.667
Armed intruders are in the studio,
please evacuate the building.

01:48:00.500 --> 01:48:02.500
Attention please...

01:48:05.125 --> 01:48:07.333
Hurry, hurry!

01:48:18.917 --> 01:48:19.999
Can you all hear me?

01:48:20.000 --> 01:48:20.916
- Yes, Cap.
- Cap.

01:48:20.917 --> 01:48:22.041
- Cap.
- Roger.

01:48:22.042 --> 01:48:25.000
We need to buy Mr. Hairy some time
while she preps.

01:48:26.875 --> 01:48:28.416
And thank you all.

01:48:29.458 --> 01:48:30.499
For helping me.

01:48:30.542 --> 01:48:33.791
How many times have you saved our asses?

01:48:33.792 --> 01:48:35.041
Especially Mr. Hairy.

01:48:35.042 --> 01:48:38.333
She leveled up by following Cap around.

01:48:38.458 --> 01:48:40.249
We'll wipe them out.

01:48:40.417 --> 01:48:41.792
This is not a game.

01:48:42.167 --> 01:48:44.333
It could really get dangerous.

01:48:47.208 --> 01:48:49.791
Alright, they're coming.

01:48:50.083 --> 01:48:52.374
Cap, requesting order.

01:48:54.875 --> 01:48:57.416
Okay, resurrection, are you ready?

01:48:57.417 --> 01:48:58.999
Let's fight without regret.

01:48:59.000 --> 01:48:59.791
Roger!

01:49:00.083 --> 01:49:01.833
Yong Guru, standby.

01:49:02.958 --> 01:49:05.791
Steady, steady, steady...

01:49:13.417 --> 01:49:14.292
Yes!

01:49:14.667 --> 01:49:16.957
Demolition, shoot when I pass.

01:49:16.958 --> 01:49:18.041
Don't worry.

01:49:18.042 --> 01:49:20.458
It'll be like the dark knight.

01:49:20.875 --> 01:49:23.999
After you pass and the tow trucks arrive,

01:49:24.000 --> 01:49:27.291
I'll flip them over with my wire.

01:49:27.292 --> 01:49:31.167
I told you I work in the film industry.

01:49:41.667 --> 01:49:42.832
Oh shit, that's not good.

01:49:42.833 --> 01:49:45.333
I knew you were all bark.

01:50:01.250 --> 01:50:02.833
Just smash into him!

01:50:03.000 --> 01:50:03.958
Pass through!

01:50:10.000 --> 01:50:10.833
Holy shit!

01:50:13.917 --> 01:50:15.167
Cap, you okay?

01:50:15.667 --> 01:50:16.625
I'm fine.

01:50:18.250 --> 01:50:19.583
Ready the next phase!

01:50:38.000 --> 01:50:40.374
Good job, Yong Guru!

01:50:40.375 --> 01:50:41.333
Yes!

01:50:48.792 --> 01:50:49.500
Demo!

01:50:49.501 --> 01:50:51.082
Cap is luring them towards you!

01:50:51.083 --> 01:50:53.041
Not yet! Not ready!

01:50:57.583 --> 01:50:59.333
No, no, not yet!

01:51:01.250 --> 01:51:02.541
Demo, now!

01:51:19.125 --> 01:51:22.375
Okay, demo! Next phase!

01:51:23.208 --> 01:51:24.124
Mr. Hairy!

01:51:24.125 --> 01:51:24.791
Hairy!

01:51:24.792 --> 01:51:26.375
What's going on? Yeo-Wool?

01:51:34.208 --> 01:51:35.333
Shut up!

01:51:51.792 --> 01:51:53.167
So sorry!

01:51:54.583 --> 01:51:55.541
My fault!

01:51:55.708 --> 01:51:56.874
Hold still!

01:52:26.083 --> 01:52:28.583
Yeo-Wool! Yeo-Wool!

01:52:31.083 --> 01:52:32.833
Bye, mofo!

01:52:42.708 --> 01:52:43.874
Stupid bastard!

01:52:44.708 --> 01:52:46.041
Yeo-Wool, crossover!

01:52:47.125 --> 01:52:49.500
Stop it! Goddammit!

01:52:53.167 --> 01:52:54.542
Boss! I'm here!

01:52:57.333 --> 01:52:58.957
Motherfucker! Shoot straight!

01:52:58.958 --> 01:53:01.041
Sorry, Boss! What happened?

01:53:11.083 --> 01:53:12.416
Useless fuck...

01:53:18.292 --> 01:53:20.042
Closer, closer...

01:53:26.917 --> 01:53:28.583
- Cap!
- Yeo-Wool, hop in!

01:53:29.333 --> 01:53:30.374
Fat chance!

01:53:34.833 --> 01:53:36.041
Goddamn...

01:54:27.208 --> 01:54:29.624
0187, suspect vehicle found.

01:54:29.625 --> 01:54:31.625
Passing through Sangam junction.

01:54:32.375 --> 01:54:34.541
18, request support,

01:54:34.750 --> 01:54:37.625
all units, converge at Sangam junction.

01:54:37.833 --> 01:54:39.958
Command center, send support.

01:54:41.583 --> 01:54:44.249
He's going around the TV station.

01:54:44.833 --> 01:54:48.291
18, cut off his retreat route,
lure him into 3rd block.

01:54:49.125 --> 01:54:51.708
Sniper unit, you are free to open fire,

01:54:52.042 --> 01:54:53.792
the suspect may be armed.

01:54:53.917 --> 01:54:55.957
Fugitive Kwon Yu is coming in now!

01:54:55.958 --> 01:54:58.124
He may be hereto give himself up.

01:54:58.125 --> 01:55:00.833
You're watching a live footage.

01:55:18.583 --> 01:55:19.833
"Live feed of Kwon Yu's arrest"

01:55:37.583 --> 01:55:39.333
what's wrong with this?

01:55:54.625 --> 01:55:56.416
Wake up, we're here.

01:55:58.083 --> 01:55:59.499
We're here already?

01:55:59.500 --> 01:56:01.207
Cap, I brought Cover and Conceal.

01:56:01.208 --> 01:56:03.541
Cap, I missed you!

01:56:03.542 --> 01:56:04.791
There she goes again.

01:56:04.792 --> 01:56:06.874
It's been tough, huh?

01:56:06.875 --> 01:56:08.207
Good to hear your voice.

01:56:08.208 --> 01:56:11.458
Mr. Hairy, did you get all the data?

01:56:37.417 --> 01:56:38.750
Completely.

01:56:43.958 --> 01:56:47.957
Mr. Hairy'll block regular news
and broadcast ours.

01:56:47.958 --> 01:56:49.333
Do this properly.

01:56:49.583 --> 01:56:52.541
They'll fuse together if you keep at it.

01:56:52.708 --> 01:56:53.957
So nervous...

01:56:53.958 --> 01:56:55.333
Are you ready?

01:56:59.917 --> 01:57:04.041
Killer of the century, Kwon Yu's truth

01:57:04.042 --> 01:57:07.500
will be brought to you
exclusively on 69 enter.

01:57:08.250 --> 01:57:11.457
Did he really murder hottie Noh Joon-Young?

01:57:11.458 --> 01:57:13.416
Is this the truth?

01:57:19.083 --> 01:57:21.957
My daughter messed up.

01:57:21.958 --> 01:57:25.166
He's an actor named Noh Joan-young.

01:57:25.167 --> 01:57:27.374
I think he's a goner.

01:57:27.375 --> 01:57:30.457
This is Hyosin group's Chairman.

01:57:30.458 --> 01:57:32.457
Daddy, I'm hungry.

01:57:32.458 --> 01:57:35.457
That bitch is Noh's killer.

01:57:35.458 --> 01:57:39.916
Then what's the real truth
behind Kwon Yu's rape-murder?

01:57:39.917 --> 01:57:43.374
My son made a mistake,
he must've been drunk.

01:57:43.375 --> 01:57:47.875
He's prone to mistakes at his age,
even killing.

01:57:48.458 --> 01:57:51.332
You must be anxious before the big day.

01:57:51.333 --> 01:57:52.832
- Isn't that you?
- What?

01:57:52.833 --> 01:57:54.957
The one who killed Ha Ji-Su...

01:57:54.958 --> 01:57:56.166
I'm so fucked...

01:57:56.167 --> 01:57:59.041
Was the son of Councilor Park,
who wrote the Kwon Yu Bill.

01:57:59.042 --> 01:58:01.874
But Kwon Yu was arrested instead.

01:58:01.875 --> 01:58:03.207
Did you see the news?

01:58:03.208 --> 01:58:05.499
Will Kwon reach the trial?

01:58:05.500 --> 01:58:08.166
- I'm Min Chum-Sang.
- Motherfuckers!

01:58:08.375 --> 01:58:09.916
"Motherfuckers"...

01:58:11.042 --> 01:58:12.582
I'm reaching my boiling point.

01:58:12.583 --> 01:58:13.791
This is news!

01:58:14.292 --> 01:58:17.083
Ms. Lee... Ms. Lee?

01:58:19.958 --> 01:58:22.541
Aren't you curious who
the puppet master is?

01:58:22.583 --> 01:58:24.416
Min, I'm in trouble.

01:58:24.417 --> 01:58:27.250
"Homeless arrested for Jamsil murder"
I accidentally killed my wife...

01:58:27.333 --> 01:58:29.041
Her body will be found inside

01:58:29.042 --> 01:58:32.374
a container in Jamsil tomorrow.

01:58:32.375 --> 01:58:34.500
What are you guys doing?

01:58:35.042 --> 01:58:36.457
- What have you done?
- min!

01:58:36.458 --> 01:58:37.957
You saved my neck!

01:58:37.958 --> 01:58:38.749
Thank you!

01:58:38.750 --> 01:58:41.832
"Busan Torso murderer suspect identity
revealed," that was an amazing idea.

01:58:41.833 --> 01:58:43.666
How should I pay you?

01:58:43.667 --> 01:58:47.541
My office manager will contact you soon.

01:58:47.542 --> 01:58:50.041
Mr. Min, you're a genius.

01:58:50.042 --> 01:58:52.707
Yes, I may be one.

01:58:52.708 --> 01:58:55.082
You're a natural born.

01:58:55.083 --> 01:58:58.041
Detectives, please, I'm so sorry!

01:58:58.042 --> 01:59:00.042
He should be torn to bits.

01:59:01.000 --> 01:59:04.124
Go to jail based on
the scenarios I created,

01:59:04.125 --> 01:59:07.874
and with an article I
wrote, people'd laugh...

01:59:07.875 --> 01:59:12.291
Min Chum-Sang is the bastard
who controlled everything.

01:59:12.292 --> 01:59:13.833
That's enough, you fuckers!

01:59:14.042 --> 01:59:16.124
This is the guy who deserves to die.

01:59:16.125 --> 01:59:17.166
Stop it!

01:59:17.167 --> 01:59:21.667
We are going to release our data
before turning them over,

01:59:21.708 --> 01:59:24.874
so anyone who are wronged
by him can use them.

01:59:25.417 --> 01:59:29.917
And officers, grab min before he takes off!

01:59:30.000 --> 01:59:31.708
How dare they challenge me?

01:59:36.417 --> 01:59:37.583
The wheel...

01:59:41.833 --> 01:59:46.124
Min Chum-Sang, I took your wheel, asshole!

01:59:50.833 --> 01:59:53.916
What do we do? He's completely exposed.

01:59:53.917 --> 01:59:57.582
Don't worry, he's replaceable.

01:59:57.583 --> 02:00:02.083
1 wrong conviction is
worse than losing 10 criminals.

02:00:02.500 --> 02:00:04.500
Aren't you smarter now?

02:00:05.625 --> 02:00:08.625
Anyone can be framed.

02:00:09.083 --> 02:00:11.416
That concludes today's news.

02:00:11.417 --> 02:00:13.957
I'm your sexy baby, Cover.

02:00:13.958 --> 02:00:16.499
Okay! Very good!

02:00:22.167 --> 02:00:23.167
Uncuff me.

02:00:47.417 --> 02:00:48.500
Mr. ma!

02:00:50.208 --> 02:00:51.333
Good to see you!

02:00:57.833 --> 02:00:58.916
It's him?

02:01:02.917 --> 02:01:05.917
Guys, what are you doing?
You shouldn't do that.

02:01:08.292 --> 02:01:10.666
Kwon Yu, who was framed
and jailed for murder,

02:01:10.667 --> 02:01:13.707
was cleared of all charges
and became a free man.

02:01:13.708 --> 02:01:17.582
The authorities are
also gathering public opinions

02:01:17.583 --> 02:01:22.083
about compensating the wrongly convicted

02:01:22.458 --> 02:01:25.291
and preventing similar future convictions.

02:01:25.292 --> 02:01:27.916
- The real killer of Ha Ji-Su
- baby, I got the key!

02:01:27.917 --> 02:01:30.499
And the son of Councilor Park,

02:01:30.500 --> 02:01:35.000
Park Jae-Hyun was arrested after hiding
in a motel for 40 days.

02:01:43.875 --> 02:01:47.833
They all said the tree was rotting.

02:01:49.708 --> 02:01:54.208
But I told them it's far from it.

02:01:55.375 --> 02:01:58.833
I had a dream that night.

02:01:59.917 --> 02:02:01.583
In the dream,

02:02:01.958 --> 02:02:06.458
I saw the tree grow strong
towards the blue sky.

02:02:11.167 --> 02:02:15.667
I gathered everyone
and said the tree wasn't rotting.

02:02:18.833 --> 02:02:22.541
This tree is not a rotting one.
