00:00.834 --> 00:04.129
It seems today that all you see

00:04.171 --> 00:05.797
Is violence in movies

00:05.839 --> 00:07.466
and sex on TV

00:07.466 --> 00:10.928
But where are those
good old-fashioned values

00:11.178 --> 00:14.097
On which we used to rely?

00:14.181 --> 00:17.434
Lucky there's a family guy

00:17.476 --> 00:20.687
Lucky there's a man
who positively can do

00:20.729 --> 00:22.314
All the things that make us

00:22.356 --> 00:24.066
Laugh and cry

00:24.066 --> 00:25.609
He's... A...

00:25.692 --> 00:27.705
Fam... ily... Guy!

00:38.497 --> 00:40.541
Oh, this is
so exciting.

00:40.582 --> 00:43.126
Maybe we'll get lucky
and see another crash this year.

00:43.168 --> 00:45.087
Yeah, we can get some souvenirs.

00:45.170 --> 00:47.965
Last year, I got an altimeter
and a shinbone.

01:11.280 --> 01:12.447
Eh, this is boring--

01:12.489 --> 01:14.741
I'd rather be home watching 
that video from The Ring.

01:14.825 --> 01:15.868
Peter, don't...

01:15.951 --> 01:18.620
they say if you
watch that video you die.

01:18.620 --> 01:19.997
Ah, that's a lot
of baloney.

01:21.415 --> 01:24.084
We can build
this thing together

01:24.418 --> 01:26.837
Standing strong forever

01:27.129 --> 01:30.966
Nothing's gonna stop us now.

01:30.924 --> 01:33.385
Look, there's
Mr. Quagmire's plane!

01:33.218 --> 01:34.386
Ladies and gentlemen,

01:34.428 --> 01:37.139
keep your eye on the sky
for the aerial acrobatics

01:37.181 --> 01:39.349
of Captain Glen Quagmire.

01:48.525 --> 01:50.235
Whoa, gonna need some help here.

01:50.861 --> 01:52.654
All right.

01:55.073 --> 01:56.033
Wait a minute,
where...

01:56.200 --> 01:56.825
Oh, my God,

01:56.950 --> 01:57.826
where's Stewie?

01:57.910 --> 01:59.369
Don't panic, Lois,
we'll find him.

01:59.453 --> 02:01.246
I'm good at picking
people out of a crowd.

02:01.288 --> 02:02.956
Oh, gosh, this is hard.

02:02.915 --> 02:05.417
Um, yeah, could I get
a better look at number two?

02:06.752 --> 02:09.128
And, number four
could you step forward, too?

02:09.922 --> 02:12.716
Okay, uh, number five,
uh, look at number one.

02:12.716 --> 02:15.469
Look at him like you haven't seen him
in a while and you're happy.

02:15.511 --> 02:17.471
Okay, not too happy,
not too happy.

02:17.513 --> 02:18.514
Pull it back,
pull it back.

02:18.555 --> 02:21.141
Okay, and, um,
number three could you say,

02:21.183 --> 02:24.728
"Julie, I promise to get back on 
my feet before the baby arrives."

02:24.811 --> 02:28.398
Julie, I promise to get back on
my feet before the baby arrives.

02:28.732 --> 02:29.399
He's good.

02:29.399 --> 02:30.734
Yeah, he's always good,
very good.

02:30.776 --> 02:32.528
Yeah, yeah, okay, thank you.

02:32.778 --> 02:35.030
Stewie? Stewie!

02:35.113 --> 02:37.407
Hey, everybody,
it's Weenie and the Butt here

02:37.407 --> 02:38.825
live at the Quahog Air Show.

02:38.867 --> 02:41.912
We're all ready for
the Weenie sound-alike contest.

02:41.828 --> 02:42.621
I don't know, Butt,

02:42.663 --> 02:44.873
I don't think they can say my
catchphrase, because...

02:44.915 --> 02:46.917
"They no funny!"

02:48.418 --> 02:49.711
Oh, there it is!

02:49.753 --> 02:52.422
And if you think you can say
that just like Weenie here,

02:52.464 --> 02:56.218
you could win 97.1 dollars
for the cool weekend ahead.

02:56.218 --> 02:57.052
We have a butt.

02:57.094 --> 02:58.470
We-we have a butt!

02:58.595 --> 03:02.057
Cool weekends
in the morning, 97.1 FM.

03:02.099 --> 03:04.893

Weenie!

03:15.571 --> 03:16.196
And the Butt.

03:16.238 --> 03:17.114
And welcome back.

03:17.155 --> 03:19.491
Uh, excuse I-I got
to find a lost kid.

03:19.575 --> 03:20.158
Can I use your mic?

03:20.200 --> 03:21.201
That's what
she said.

03:21.243 --> 03:24.037
Whoa,
you got Butt-slammed!

03:26.498 --> 03:28.167
Listen, I could really
use a hand here.

03:28.167 --> 03:29.459
That's what
he said!

03:29.501 --> 03:31.461
Butt slam!

03:32.921 --> 03:35.299
That's Manic Monkey
on 97.1.

03:35.299 --> 03:37.801
Manic Monkey. 97.1

03:38.427 --> 03:39.970

03:39.970 --> 03:41.513
All weekend long.

03:41.555 --> 03:42.556
Weenie and the Butt!

03:42.556 --> 03:43.348
In the morning.

03:43.807 --> 03:44.892
On the r-r-radio.

03:44.933 --> 03:45.809
FM!

03:46.310 --> 03:46.935
Gimme that.

03:46.935 --> 03:49.938
Stewie Griffin, will you please
report to the radio booth.

03:50.022 --> 03:51.064
Stewie Griffin.

03:51.273 --> 03:52.983
Hey, that's quite a
voice you've got there.

03:53.025 --> 03:54.902
You ever think
about doing radio?

03:54.776 --> 03:57.321
Well, uh, I listen
to a lot of radio.

03:57.362 --> 03:59.948
Peter and Lois leave the radio on
when they go out

03:59.948 --> 04:01.158
so I feel like somebody's home.

04:01.200 --> 04:02.242
Well, here's
my card.

04:02.284 --> 04:03.619
Call me if
you're interested.

04:03.619 --> 04:05.954
Hey, okay, we've got
our first contestant.

04:05.996 --> 04:07.581
Let's hear
Weenie's catchphrase.

04:08.832 --> 04:10.542
They no
funny.

04:11.168 --> 04:13.420
I think we have
a wee-ner.

04:15.631 --> 04:18.926
And that's Dicky
the Punchline Donkey, on 97.1.

04:18.966 --> 04:22.596
Dicky the Punchline Donkey,
on Cool 97.1

04:22.638 --> 04:24.431
Cool weekends.

04:24.431 --> 04:25.641
On the radio!

04:25.682 --> 04:26.934
In the-the... morning!

04:27.059 --> 04:27.684
FM.

04:27.809 --> 04:28.435
Cool.

04:28.560 --> 04:29.645
WQHG!

04:29.770 --> 04:30.562
Cool weekends!

04:30.687 --> 04:31.438
In the morning.

04:31.563 --> 04:32.564
On Ninety-seven...

04:32.648 --> 04:33.482
Point one.

04:33.565 --> 04:34.650
Ninety-seven point one.

04:38.654 --> 04:40.405
And now back to Round Table,

04:40.447 --> 04:42.908
with Al Michaels,
Harold Ramis, Ray Rono,

04:42.950 --> 04:43.951
and Kermit the Frog.

04:44.034 --> 04:46.578
There zoning laws are infringing
on the rights of citizens...

04:46.578 --> 04:48.914
Uh, if I might interrupt for a minute, 
I'd like to point out that--

04:48.580 --> 04:50.290
You've had your time.
Let someone else speak.

04:50.332 --> 04:51.208
I haven't said a word.

04:51.208 --> 04:52.000
It was that guy.

04:52.125 --> 04:54.002
Don't look at me, I can't get
a word in edgewise.

04:54.002 --> 04:55.796
Well, then who the hell's
been talking this whole time?

05:01.426 --> 05:02.261
Thelma!

05:02.386 --> 05:04.304
Hello, darling.

05:04.346 --> 05:06.723
Oh, my God, what
a pleasant surprise.

05:06.849 --> 05:08.267
Mom, what are you
doing here?

05:08.308 --> 05:10.602
Peter,
I left your father.

05:10.602 --> 05:11.270
What?

05:11.270 --> 05:12.437
Wait, wait, wait,
hang on a second.

05:12.437 --> 05:14.690
I never see you, and then
you finally come visit me

05:14.731 --> 05:16.316
and you drop
a bombshell like this?

05:16.358 --> 05:19.278
This is just like what happened
at the Peanuts reunion.

05:26.535 --> 05:27.619
Stupid song!

05:27.953 --> 05:29.329
What are you looking at?

05:30.664 --> 05:31.540
Yeah, it's me.

05:31.665 --> 05:34.126
Your old punching bag,
Charlie Brown.

05:34.835 --> 05:37.713
Everybody wish Snoopy was here
and Woodstock?

05:38.005 --> 05:40.632
Everybody wish Snoopy
and Woodstock was here?

05:40.799 --> 05:41.925
Well, they're dead!

05:42.050 --> 05:43.093
And guess what?

05:43.218 --> 05:45.012
I sold Snoopy the junk.

05:45.179 --> 05:46.972
That's right,
he got it from me!

05:48.182 --> 05:50.309
I swear I didn't know
how strong it was.

05:50.976 --> 05:54.438
And now he's dead!
They're both dead!

05:54.730 --> 05:56.732
I don't give a crap
about Woodstock,

05:57.399 --> 06:00.027
but Snoopy...

06:00.652 --> 06:01.904
Get off me, you skank!

06:03.447 --> 06:05.782
I can't believe
you left Dad.

06:05.782 --> 06:08.202
I have needs
that he didn't satisfy.

06:08.243 --> 06:10.621
And I'm still
a young woman, Peter.

06:10.621 --> 06:13.081
82 is the new 74.

06:13.123 --> 06:16.293
I'm putting my fine ass
back on the market.

06:16.293 --> 06:19.213
Boy, this is really going
to upset my evil brother, Thaddeus.

06:19.254 --> 06:23.133
Nyah... this will surely affect
my inheritance... nyah.

06:25.802 --> 06:27.304
Hi, I'm Brian Griffin,

06:27.304 --> 06:29.014
and you're listening
to The Lunch Hour,

06:29.014 --> 06:31.391
serving up food for the mind.

06:31.642 --> 06:33.227
Today's entree is politics.

06:33.268 --> 06:34.853
What's on your mind today?

06:34.895 --> 06:36.688
The governor's budget,
stem cell research?

06:36.772 --> 06:39.441
Give us a hot spoonful
of your opinion.

06:39.441 --> 06:41.527
Ok, we have a question
from Quahog.

06:41.652 --> 06:42.861
Caller, you're on
The Lunch Hour.

06:43.403 --> 06:43.820
Can I take your order?

06:43.862 --> 06:46.365
Yes, uh, I'll have a big helping
of the pretentious crap.

06:46.448 --> 06:49.743
Whoa, sometimes the, uh,
crazy ones get through.

06:49.785 --> 06:52.996
Okay, we have Rose,
from Cranston, on the phone.

06:52.621 --> 06:54.498
Welcome, Rose,
can I take your order?

06:54.498 --> 06:57.918
Um, yes, that turkey, that-
that raw turkey that you ate

06:57.960 --> 07:00.379
off the counter last week
that got Lois mad,

07:00.420 --> 07:03.423
when you pooped that out
was the timer still in there?

07:03.465 --> 07:04.883
And we're out of time.

07:04.883 --> 07:06.468
This has been The Lunch Hour.

07:06.510 --> 07:09.513
Join us next week, when our 
guest will be Gore Vidal.

07:09.513 --> 07:11.807
And remember,
life is full of entrees,

07:11.807 --> 07:13.308
so don't fill up on bread.

07:13.350 --> 07:15.477
I'm going to throw you now
to Weenie and The Butt

07:15.477 --> 07:16.478
in the afternoon.

07:16.478 --> 07:17.771
Weenie and the Butt!

07:17.813 --> 07:19.022
Ninety-seven point one

07:19.022 --> 07:20.107
In the afternoon.

07:20.148 --> 07:21.483
In the afternoon.

07:21.525 --> 07:22.609
Oh, my God.

07:22.651 --> 07:23.610
WQHG!

07:23.652 --> 07:24.403
Turn it on

07:24.403 --> 07:26.280
and rip the knob off!

07:26.321 --> 07:28.282
You're listening
to the radio!

07:29.908 --> 07:31.368
Sir, I'm very sorry.

07:31.368 --> 07:34.037
That-that was this guy I know.
He thinks he's hilarious.

07:33.912 --> 07:35.289
He is hilarious!

07:35.330 --> 07:37.583
I was on my way in here
to cancel your show,

07:37.624 --> 07:39.585
but the banter you did
with that guy,

07:39.626 --> 07:41.628
well, as we say
in the radio business,

07:41.670 --> 07:44.923
"If you put that on the radio,
people will listen to it!"

07:44.923 --> 07:46.466
Make him part of the show.

07:46.508 --> 07:47.676
Oh, you-you don't want him.

07:47.718 --> 07:49.553
He's not really
a professional like me.

07:49.595 --> 07:51.221
Listen, you get
that kid in here.

07:51.263 --> 07:52.848
We need more laughs on the show.

07:53.015 --> 07:57.477
Well, I guess he couldn't be any worse
than Tim McCarver is at sportscasting.

07:57.477 --> 08:02.774
In my view, as good as the Yankees were
in the first half of this game,

08:02.858 --> 08:05.861
that's how as bad
they've been now.

08:11.366 --> 08:13.327
Poor Peter,
 I know he's having

08:13.368 --> 08:15.579
a hard time with this
whole divorce thing.

08:15.787 --> 08:19.041
I feel kind of guilty that
 I'm here looking for a date.

08:19.082 --> 08:20.292
Thelma, stop that.

08:20.334 --> 08:22.002
You have a right
to be happy.

08:22.294 --> 08:24.296
And-and there's a lot
of great people here

08:24.296 --> 08:25.255
Why don't you mingle?

08:25.380 --> 08:26.798
Oh, my God,
Lois, you single now?!

08:27.633 --> 08:29.635
No, Glen,
I'm here with Thelma.

08:29.635 --> 08:30.427
Who's Thelma?

08:30.469 --> 08:31.512
This is Thelma.

08:31.512 --> 08:33.514
Eww!

08:33.804 --> 08:35.765
I don't know if this
is gonna work, Lois.

08:35.807 --> 08:38.101
I'm a little shy at
these types of things.

08:38.143 --> 08:40.312
Oh, you can
overcome shyness.

08:40.437 --> 08:43.982
Think of the spider in Charlotte's Web
who had to overcome Tourette's.

08:46.944 --> 08:47.903
I don't know, Lois.

08:48.028 --> 08:50.405
I haven't met a single
interesting person.

08:50.822 --> 08:52.032
Good evening,
I'm Tom Tuer

08:52.115 --> 08:53.325
trying to get back
on my feet

08:53.367 --> 08:56.161
after having my ass handed to me
by my bitch of an ex-wife.

08:56.161 --> 08:57.246
I'm Thelma.

08:57.287 --> 08:58.580
I'll just be going.

08:58.747 --> 08:59.998
Can I get you
some punch?

08:59.998 --> 09:04.378
Oh, no, you see, if you're one
of ten million Americans like me...

09:04.419 --> 09:05.295
Like me.

09:05.337 --> 09:06.255
Like me.

09:06.296 --> 09:07.881
...with a bladder
control problem,

09:07.965 --> 09:10.133
punch just goes
right through you.

09:10.175 --> 09:12.052
Eww!

09:15.639 --> 09:17.432
I didn't hear you come
in last night.

09:17.474 --> 09:19.643
Did you have a good time
at your prostitutes convention?

09:19.726 --> 09:21.603
Peter, I was just trying
to help your mother

09:21.645 --> 09:22.688
meet some new friends.

09:22.729 --> 09:24.273
Lois, you're too nosey.

09:24.314 --> 09:25.816
Like that waiter
at that restaurant.

09:25.774 --> 09:27.776
And who had the prime rib?

09:27.776 --> 09:29.778
I hardly think that's any
of your business.

09:30.362 --> 09:32.573
Come on, Mom,
you can't stay in bed all day.

09:32.614 --> 09:34.908
You got to call dad and get
back together with--

09:34.741 --> 09:37.452
Aah! Holy crap!

09:37.536 --> 09:39.913
We'll have more on these
new developments after this.

09:43.417 --> 09:45.169
I can't believe
what I saw in there.

09:45.210 --> 09:47.546
You were messing around
in what was basically

09:47.629 --> 09:48.714
my first apartment.

09:48.755 --> 09:50.799
Peter, you should
be happy for her.

09:50.841 --> 09:52.301
She's just having fun.

09:52.342 --> 09:53.886
I don't see what
the problem is.

09:53.969 --> 09:55.387
Tom is a wonderful man.

09:55.429 --> 09:57.639
I don't see the problem, either,
but let's go to Ollie Williams

09:57.681 --> 09:59.474
for the inepth analysis. Ollie?

09:59.516 --> 10:00.142
Lady's old!

10:00.184 --> 10:01.518
Thanks, Ollie,
over to you, Peter.

10:01.560 --> 10:04.188
Tom Tucker, I forbid you
to see my mother.

10:04.188 --> 10:06.231
Peter, you can't talk
to Tom that way.

10:06.273 --> 10:09.484
He won a local Emmy for his work
with the retardeds.

10:09.568 --> 10:10.944
They certainly wanted
to hug me.

10:10.986 --> 10:12.321
Maybe in time, you will, too.

10:12.404 --> 10:13.071
Thanks for watching;

10:13.113 --> 10:13.947
I'm Tom Tucker.

10:13.989 --> 10:14.656
Good night.

10:21.955 --> 10:23.665
All right, look, let's get
one thing straight, Stewie.

10:23.707 --> 10:26.168
The only reason you're here
is that my boss ordered me

10:26.168 --> 10:26.919
to bring you on.

10:26.960 --> 10:29.338
All right, this is my show,
and it's a serious,

10:29.338 --> 10:32.090
intellectual hour of discussion and
I want to keep it that way.

10:32.132 --> 10:32.966
Hey, no problem.

10:33.008 --> 10:35.802
All right, in three, two, one...

10:35.844 --> 10:37.095
This is The Lunch Hour

10:37.095 --> 10:37.554
with your host...

10:37.596 --> 10:39.515
Hey, what's up Quahog?!

10:39.556 --> 10:41.016
From the station
that reaches the beaches,

10:41.058 --> 10:43.018
you're listening
to Dingo and The Baby!

10:43.060 --> 10:44.603
Dingo and the Baby

10:44.645 --> 10:47.439
97.1 Quahog

10:47.481 --> 10:49.024
Oh, baby!

10:50.651 --> 10:51.777
What the hell are you doing?

10:51.818 --> 10:53.654
Wha-What the hell does that have
to do with anything?

10:53.695 --> 10:56.240
They're just wacky sounds,
you know to liven things up.

10:56.281 --> 10:57.908
D-i-n-g-o!

10:58.450 --> 10:59.117
D-D-Dingo!

10:59.159 --> 10:59.576
Dingo

10:59.618 --> 11:00.202
and the...

11:00.744 --> 11:02.120
Baby!

11:04.373 --> 11:09.086
Oh, sexy girlfriend!

11:13.632 --> 11:16.093
Peter, would you stop spying
on your  mother's date?

11:16.134 --> 11:17.845
I can't stand it
anymore, Lois.

11:17.845 --> 11:19.096
I'm going to put
a stop to this.

11:22.057 --> 11:22.766
Hello?

11:22.808 --> 11:26.854
Uh, hello, yes, uh, this is, uh, 
this is Tom Tucker's personal physician,

11:26.895 --> 11:28.564
Dr. T and the Women.

11:28.564 --> 11:33.277
Um, could you tell Tom his contagious 
penis cancer medicine is ready.

11:33.318 --> 11:34.570
Is this Peter?

11:34.570 --> 11:36.780
Uh, no, it's, uh, uh, Lois.

11:36.822 --> 11:39.241
Uh, Lois, don't
crank call my mother.

11:39.283 --> 11:40.409
I'm gonna have to
pinch you for that.

11:40.450 --> 11:42.119
Ow, Peter,
don't pinch me!

11:42.160 --> 11:42.870
Ow!

11:42.911 --> 11:43.996
Ow... stop it!

11:44.079 --> 11:45.539
Knock it off,
damn it!

11:45.539 --> 11:47.833
Cut it out-- maybe I'll tickle you, 
huh, how about that?!

11:47.875 --> 11:48.333
No, don't.

11:48.834 --> 11:50.711
Here you go,
tickle, tickle.

11:50.711 --> 11:51.211
Cut it out!

11:51.545 --> 11:52.629
Stop it!

11:53.839 --> 11:54.673
I mean it!

11:54.381 --> 11:55.340
I mean it!

11:55.007 --> 11:55.799
Aah.

11:56.633 --> 11:59.553
Aah... aah!

11:56.925 --> 12:00.721
Well, I told you to stop!

12:00.762 --> 12:03.765
I tickle you, you hit me
in the head with a frying pan?!

12:03.765 --> 12:04.850
I told you to stop!

12:04.850 --> 12:06.101
I taste blood!

12:06.101 --> 12:07.227
Well, there's a lot of it.

12:10.981 --> 12:12.024
Hey there, champ.

12:13.192 --> 12:15.485
Peter, I know this is all
a big adjustment for you,

12:15.485 --> 12:17.446
but all I want is for
your mom to be happy.

12:17.487 --> 12:19.740
Well, why can't she
go back with my dad?

12:19.740 --> 12:21.950
Well, I can't answer that,
but I'm gonna do

12:21.950 --> 12:24.119
my best to make her
even happier than those kids

12:24.161 --> 12:25.662
on Three Wishes
with Amy Grant.

12:25.704 --> 12:27.539
What's your wish, Billy?

12:27.581 --> 12:29.291
Can you cure my cancer?

12:29.291 --> 12:32.336
No, but how about
if Spider-Man gives you

12:32.377 --> 12:34.671
a $50 gift card to Sears?!

12:35.380 --> 12:37.090
He-Here, get well.

12:37.508 --> 12:39.635
You know, I heard a
rumor about you today?

12:39.635 --> 12:40.511
You did?

12:40.511 --> 12:41.136
Yep.

12:41.136 --> 12:42.804
I heard you like milk shakes.

12:42.679 --> 12:43.931
Oh boy, do I!

12:44.097 --> 12:45.766
Let's go get ourselves 
a shake, huh?

12:45.807 --> 12:46.475
Yeah!

12:46.558 --> 12:48.560
I want to get
a milk shake, too.

12:48.602 --> 12:50.145
Too bad- go get
your own father.

12:54.775 --> 12:57.069
Hey, Carl, can I get a carton
of smokes, please?

12:57.069 --> 12:57.819
Sure, Brian.

12:57.819 --> 13:00.364
And uh, what's that little
rubber mailman

13:00.405 --> 13:01.240
you got behind there?

13:01.281 --> 13:02.324
Oh, you like that, huh?

13:02.324 --> 13:03.659
Yeah, does
that thing squeak?

13:03.700 --> 13:04.535
Yeah, it does.

13:05.452 --> 13:07.329
All right, I'll take that,
and I'm gonna hurry home

13:07.371 --> 13:08.163
and show it to Lois.

13:08.205 --> 13:10.707
Hey, I'd recognize
that voice anywhere!

13:10.791 --> 13:14.419
You're Dingo, that dog that plays
all those fart sounds on the radio!

13:14.461 --> 13:15.629
Awesome!

13:15.629 --> 13:17.923
Oh, yeah, yeah,
sorry about that,

13:17.965 --> 13:19.466
the show's gotten
a little lowbrow.

13:19.508 --> 13:20.968
What are you
talking about?!

13:21.051 --> 13:22.928
It's, like, the most
hilarious show ever!

13:22.970 --> 13:24.972
Hey, could I get
your autograph?

13:25.013 --> 13:26.515
My... really?

13:26.557 --> 13:28.851
Wow, you're... gosh,
you're making me feel

13:28.892 --> 13:30.686
more important than
a dwarf among midgets.

13:31.645 --> 13:33.272
Hey, can you reach
the Crispix?

13:33.272 --> 13:34.731
Yes, I can.

13:37.067 --> 13:40.279
How awesome is this-- going out
to dinner with my new family?

13:40.320 --> 13:41.488
Hi, can I help you?

13:41.488 --> 13:43.073
I want,
I want that one!

13:43.115 --> 13:45.200
All right, hold on,
we'll get you that one.

13:45.242 --> 13:46.201
I want straws!

13:46.201 --> 13:47.953
We'll get you a straw.

13:47.995 --> 13:48.996
You want a Kid's Meal?

13:49.121 --> 13:49.746
No!

13:49.746 --> 13:50.497
Do you mean, "yes"?

13:50.539 --> 13:51.623
Yes!

13:51.665 --> 13:52.833
Okay, one Kid's Meal.

13:52.875 --> 13:54.001
And what'll you have,
honey?

13:54.042 --> 13:56.587
I'll have a fish sandwich
and a Sanka.

13:56.628 --> 13:58.672
Oh, he's adorable.

13:58.755 --> 14:00.382
Say hi to the nice lady, Peter.

14:00.424 --> 14:01.341
Aah.

14:01.425 --> 14:02.134
Oh, he's shy.

14:10.267 --> 14:13.103
I don't believe
in fretting and grieving

14:13.228 --> 14:16.023
Why mess around with stride?

14:16.648 --> 14:20.235
I never was cut out
to step and strut out

14:20.652 --> 14:23.447
Give me the simple life

14:23.488 --> 14:27.201
Some find it pleasant dining
on pheasants

14:27.367 --> 14:30.496
Those things roll
off my knife

14:30.496 --> 14:34.458
Just serve me tomatoes
and mashed potatoes

14:34.541 --> 14:37.461
Give me the simple life.

14:39.880 --> 14:42.216
We now return
to the Sunday afternoon movie:

14:42.257 --> 14:44.218
Masturbator and Commander.

14:46.053 --> 14:48.597
Captain, the enemy ship
has opened fire on us.

14:48.639 --> 14:49.473
I'll be right out!

14:49.515 --> 14:51.433
Sir, we've already
lost ten men.

14:51.433 --> 14:52.226
Hang on!

14:52.226 --> 14:54.186
Sir, don't you think
we should return fire?

14:54.228 --> 14:55.312
Yeah, yeah, go
ahead and do that,

14:55.354 --> 14:57.147
and I'll-I'll meet you up there
in like five minutes.

14:57.606 --> 14:59.983
Peter, I've never seen
you so happy.

15:00.025 --> 15:01.902
Well, Lois, I never realized
what it was like

15:01.902 --> 15:02.945
to have a real dad.

15:02.945 --> 15:05.155
I mean, my own dad
was such a ballbuster,

15:05.197 --> 15:07.199
I-I guess I just always
thought that was normal.

15:07.241 --> 15:09.576
But Papa Tom is so different.

15:09.618 --> 15:11.245
For the first time in my life,

15:11.286 --> 15:13.121
I feel like I have
a real family, you know?

15:13.163 --> 15:14.915
I mean I'm-I'm not just going 
through the motions

15:14.957 --> 15:16.166
 like I do around here.

15:16.250 --> 15:18.293
Hey, champ, you want to
watch Chicken Little?

15:19.211 --> 15:20.003
Yeah!

15:20.128 --> 15:21.630
And what does
a chicken say?

15:21.672 --> 15:22.965
"Moo!"

15:23.882 --> 15:24.758
Why not.

15:25.092 --> 15:26.093
Come on, Ma!

15:26.885 --> 15:28.262
Hey, what gives
with the suitcase?

15:28.303 --> 15:32.349
Tom, there's no easy way to say this,
I'll just come right out with it.

15:32.391 --> 15:33.433
I'm leaving.

15:33.475 --> 15:34.184
Wha--

15:34.184 --> 15:35.727
leaving, why?

15:35.769 --> 15:37.396
Tommy, this has been great,

15:37.437 --> 15:40.023
but I wasn't looking
for anything long-term.

15:40.065 --> 15:44.069
I just needed someone to clear 
all the bats out of my plumbing.

15:44.069 --> 15:45.279
What do we do now Bill?

15:45.279 --> 15:46.488
We write, Tim.

15:46.488 --> 15:48.115
We write our story.

15:49.449 --> 15:50.909
Good bye, dear.

15:53.287 --> 15:55.664
It's all my fault!

15:58.709 --> 16:00.002
Nyah!

16:03.213 --> 16:05.841
I know it hurts right now, Peter,
but we'll get through this.

16:05.883 --> 16:07.759
You're still my little buddy, right?

16:07.843 --> 16:08.552
Yeah.

16:08.594 --> 16:09.553
Then we'll be okay.

16:09.595 --> 16:10.304
Good night, buddy.

16:10.304 --> 16:12.014
Good night, Papa Tom.

16:12.055 --> 16:12.723
Good night, son.

16:12.764 --> 16:13.557
Good night, Lois.

16:13.599 --> 16:14.349
Good night.

16:15.100 --> 16:16.685
Peter, this is a little strange.

16:16.768 --> 16:19.354
No stranger than when
Darth Vader was a meter maid.

16:20.063 --> 16:22.191
Oh, come on, man,
cut me a break!

16:22.191 --> 16:24.151
I was only in there
for like five minutes!

16:24.193 --> 16:25.903
I already started writing the ticket.

16:25.944 --> 16:28.155
You know, I make
your annual salary in a week.

16:28.197 --> 16:29.573
Are you happy doing
what you're doing?

16:29.615 --> 16:30.908
'Cause you're pathetic.

16:41.627 --> 16:42.836
I got to do it, Karen.

16:42.836 --> 16:45.088
I just... I-I got to take a shot.

16:45.172 --> 16:47.591
That guy, that guy
just got to me today.

16:47.674 --> 16:50.552
You do whatever you think is right,
and I'll support it.

16:52.137 --> 16:54.056
I don't really understand it.

16:54.097 --> 16:55.641
What do you want this loan for?

16:55.682 --> 16:58.727
I want to build a giant space station
that can destroy a planet.

16:58.769 --> 17:01.980
I don't know that that would be
a good investment on our end.

17:01.438 --> 17:03.857
I mean, I want to open
a sports bar.

17:03.440 --> 17:06.193
Good morning, Quahog!

17:06.276 --> 17:08.069
You're here with Dingo...

17:10.196 --> 17:11.531
And the Baby...

17:12.907 --> 17:14.617
And if you're thinking
about changing the station...

17:14.660 --> 17:17.119
Don't... you do it!

17:17.119 --> 17:19.915
Today, we got Homeless Hank from
the Dumpster out back with us.

17:19.915 --> 17:20.665
Hey, I got an idea:

17:20.707 --> 17:22.792
How about the first three women
willing to come down

17:22.792 --> 17:24.795
and have sex with Hank
get free boob jobs

17:24.837 --> 17:26.505
courtesy of Dr. John Viener?

17:26.547 --> 17:27.839
Are you reading
my mind, man?

17:27.881 --> 17:28.632
Let's go to the phones.

17:28.674 --> 17:31.468
Go ahead caller, you're on
with Dingo and The Baby.

17:32.845 --> 17:34.346
Is this Dingo?

17:34.388 --> 17:35.472
Yes, honey,
what's your name?

17:35.472 --> 17:38.100
Sindy, with an "S."

17:38.141 --> 17:39.351
Ooh, hot.

17:39.393 --> 17:42.145
Oh, yeah, that's
hot, that is hot.

17:42.187 --> 17:43.564
Tell me something,
Sindy, how'd you like

17:43.272 --> 17:45.232
to come down here
and get naked for us?

17:45.691 --> 17:46.692
Sure.

17:46.775 --> 17:47.985
Whoa!

17:48.193 --> 17:49.319
I think we got a show.

17:49.361 --> 17:50.696
Oh yeah, we got a show!

17:50.696 --> 17:51.655
We definitely got a show!

17:51.655 --> 17:52.781
Oh, yeah, there's a show!

17:53.866 --> 17:57.035
"After all, AIDS is
a deadly, incurable disease.

17:57.119 --> 18:00.414
But no matter how you come
to judge, Charles Wheeler

18:00.497 --> 18:04.126
and his partners' unethical,
moral, and inhuman terms,

18:04.168 --> 18:07.963
the fact of the matter is,
when they fired Andrew Beckett

18:08.005 --> 18:09.631
because he had AIDS,

18:09.673 --> 18:12.634
they broke the law."

18:12.593 --> 18:14.803
My God,
what is wrong with you?

18:14.887 --> 18:17.097
I swear to God, that was 
supposed to be "Food Fight!"

18:19.933 --> 18:21.351
I want some ice cream.

18:21.393 --> 18:22.686
No, Peter, you finish your food.

18:24.438 --> 18:27.316
You, hey, you-you get back here,
right now, mister!

18:27.399 --> 18:29.526
Don't, don't you--
get down from that chair,

18:29.568 --> 18:30.360
or you're in big trouble.

18:30.694 --> 18:33.447
You put that ice cream back
right now.

18:33.530 --> 18:34.323
I mean it.

18:35.240 --> 18:36.200
I am not kidding around.

18:36.992 --> 18:38.118
I am not going to say it again.

18:39.536 --> 18:41.955
Uh-- if you put that ice cream
in your mouth you're gonna be

18:41.997 --> 18:43.207
in big trouble, young man!

18:42.998 --> 18:45.501
Uh you -- uh, uh.

18:50.797 --> 18:52.174
I hate you,
I hate you!

18:51.715 --> 18:53.175
I want my mommy!

18:53.342 --> 18:54.676
Well I'm the
best you've got!

18:54.092 --> 18:56.178
All right,
so you know the drill.

18:56.220 --> 18:57.846
We're going to turn
on the hot dog cannon,

18:57.888 --> 19:00.015
and for every hot dog that you 
catch in your mouth,

19:00.057 --> 19:03.602
you get a $100 toward a boob job
that you desperately need.

19:03.769 --> 19:04.770
I know.

19:04.770 --> 19:06.230
Okay, here we go.

19:06.980 --> 19:08.023
Oh, a miss!

19:08.065 --> 19:10.234
Aw, you got her in
the eye with that one.

19:10.526 --> 19:13.111
Whoa, that one was
a teat-seeking missile!

19:13.153 --> 19:15.822
I'm looking for Brian Griffin.

19:16.323 --> 19:17.366
Gore Vidal!

19:18.116 --> 19:20.452
I was supposed to
do The Lunch Hour?

19:20.494 --> 19:22.621
Uh... this is The Lunch Hour.

19:22.663 --> 19:25.082
That one felt like my dad.

19:25.165 --> 19:26.792
Incest in the morning.

19:26.834 --> 19:28.460
Suppressed memories.

19:28.502 --> 19:29.878
Ninety-seven point one!

19:29.920 --> 19:32.714
I think I may have made
a mistake.

19:32.756 --> 19:34.216
No, no, no, no, this is it.

19:34.258 --> 19:35.008
You're-you're 
in the right place.

19:35.050 --> 19:38.095
Uh, listen, uh, why-why don't you stick
around and talk for a while.

19:38.136 --> 19:40.013
My listeners would love
to hear about your new book.

19:40.472 --> 19:41.890
Hundred dollars, boob job!

19:41.974 --> 19:44.017
I'm, uh, going to go.

19:44.893 --> 19:46.937
Oh, my God,
what have I done?

19:46.979 --> 19:48.522
Hey, it's all
about ratings, baby,

19:48.564 --> 19:49.398
and we got 'em.

19:49.439 --> 19:51.024
No, it wasn't worth it.

19:51.066 --> 19:53.318
I'm sorry, Stewie,
I can't do this anymore.

19:53.360 --> 19:54.987
I'm more of a sell-out
than you were when you did

19:55.028 --> 19:56.572
those Butterfinger commercials.

19:57.155 --> 20:00.325
Nobody better lay a finger
on my Butterfinger.

20:00.784 --> 20:01.910
D'oh!

20:04.204 --> 20:05.497
What's your problem?

20:05.497 --> 20:07.791
Ah, Papa Tom's being a jerk.

20:07.833 --> 20:09.126
At least he talks to you.

20:09.168 --> 20:12.045
He's my dad and he hasn't 
paid attention to me in weeks.

20:12.087 --> 20:13.922
Well, all-in-all,
you should be thankful.

20:13.964 --> 20:15.632
I think the Kennedys had
a kid like you,

20:15.674 --> 20:17.009
and they had it put to sleep.

20:17.009 --> 20:19.761
Hey, Peter, I'm sorry about 
that business with the ice cream.

20:19.803 --> 20:22.890
I guess I'm just still a little torn up
about your mom.

20:23.056 --> 20:24.349
But, hey, I'll make it up to you.

20:24.391 --> 20:25.142
Let's play catch.

20:25.184 --> 20:25.934
Okay!

20:29.521 --> 20:31.148
Wait a minute,
you know what?

20:31.190 --> 20:33.275
I think you should
play catch with Jake.

20:33.317 --> 20:33.984
Really?

20:34.026 --> 20:37.029
Yeah, I had a taste of what it was like
to have a real father.

20:37.112 --> 20:39.198
I can't make him share his.

20:39.239 --> 20:41.283
Well, all right, Peter,
come on, Jake.

20:41.825 --> 20:43.952
Huh, I guess I've learned a
 little something

20:43.994 --> 20:45.913
about what it means
to be a good dad.

20:45.954 --> 20:47.831
Hey, Dad,
do you want to play baseball?

20:47.831 --> 20:50.209
Oh, my God, could
you leave me alone!

20:50.250 --> 20:51.752
You are the
neediest kid!

20:52.794 --> 20:54.796
I can't believe
you gave up our show.

20:54.838 --> 20:55.714
Yeah, sorry.

20:56.381 --> 20:57.716
I wonder who they
got to replace us.

20:58.842 --> 21:01.762
It's Magic Hour
with Dark Chocolate...

21:01.803 --> 21:02.804
And The Rod.

21:02.846 --> 21:04.389
In Rod we trust.

21:04.431 --> 21:05.557
Ninety-seven point one!

21:06.433 --> 21:07.893
Giggity giggity goo!
