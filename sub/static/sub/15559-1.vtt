02:29.349 --> 02:32.375
Chapman?
Very good.

02:49.736 --> 02:54.173
Now, in closing,
I'd like to quote Frank Capra:

02:54.374 --> 02:58.902
"Don't compromise. For only
the valiant can create.

02:59.279 --> 03:01.804
Only the daring should make films.

03:02.015 --> 03:07.248
And only the artistically incorrupt
will earn and keep the people's trust."

03:08.221 --> 03:10.917
Good luck, and goodbye.

03:17.430 --> 03:19.330
Thank you, Penny.

03:19.532 --> 03:24.333
And thank you, Frank Capra,
for those words of wisdom.

03:24.537 --> 03:27.768
Before I announce the nominees
and the winner...

03:28.241 --> 03:31.802
...of the 1 0th Annual
Student Film Awards...

03:32.579 --> 03:35.878
...keep in mind these films
were made by students...

03:36.082 --> 03:39.745
...without any outside assistance
of any kind.

03:39.953 --> 03:42.148
In many cases, it meant...

03:42.355 --> 03:45.916
...reaching into
their own back pockets.

03:46.626 --> 03:50.153
Now, the first nominee is:

03:52.232 --> 03:56.532
Carl Manknik, for
The Trial of Janet Kingsley.

03:58.905 --> 04:02.636
Isn't it true that you were with
him on July the 3rd?

04:03.209 --> 04:08.112
I have no idea what you're saying.
I've never seen him in my life.

04:08.748 --> 04:10.579
Oh, really?

04:15.555 --> 04:17.317
Well, well, well.

04:18.257 --> 04:22.319
Know what I think, Mrs. Kingsley?
I think you're a liar.

04:22.528 --> 04:23.859
-No!.
-A liar!.

04:24.063 --> 04:25.553
-No!.
-Liar!.

04:25.765 --> 04:27.027
-No!.
-Liar!.

04:27.233 --> 04:29.963
No!. You nasty man!

04:31.938 --> 04:33.269
Order.

04:33.473 --> 04:37.569
Your Honor, I object.
This is a travesty!

04:37.777 --> 04:40.610
I motion for a mistrial!

04:42.215 --> 04:43.477
Order.

04:44.384 --> 04:46.375
Order in the court.

04:50.590 --> 04:53.286
Ladies and gentlemen, Carl Manknik.

05:01.601 --> 05:03.728
Go on. Go on, Dad. Take a bow.

05:04.037 --> 05:07.564
Ladies and gentlemen, Frank Manknik.

05:10.410 --> 05:11.877
My agent for 20 years...

05:12.078 --> 05:15.912
...and the president of the
Manknik Talent Agency.

05:16.115 --> 05:18.583
Now, nominee number two:

05:19.986 --> 05:22.511
Jonathan Tristan-Bennett...

05:22.722 --> 05:25.316
...for Crossed Sabres of Truth.

05:44.610 --> 05:47.374
On June 3rd, 1817...

05:47.580 --> 05:51.346
...ten thousand men took the field
of battle at Avignon.

05:51.551 --> 05:56.011
By the noon hour, only two were left
to tell the tale.

06:31.724 --> 06:36.252
My humble thanks for this belated,
yet welcome, recognition.

06:36.462 --> 06:39.522
I reserve special thanks for
Jimmy Delvecchio...

06:39.732 --> 06:42.132
...special effects man
extraordinaire...

06:42.335 --> 06:46.601
...regrettably, killed during the
filming of Crossed Sabres of Truth.

06:48.241 --> 06:51.802
Thanks also to the
Tristan-Bennett family trust fund...

06:52.011 --> 06:54.946
...for their intuition and good faith.
Thanks.

06:58.684 --> 07:02.120
And now, nominee number three:

07:04.957 --> 07:07.152
-Lydia Johnson--
-Oh, my God!

07:13.299 --> 07:15.096
Lydia Johnson for...

07:15.301 --> 07:18.031
...Afterbirth of a Notion?

07:20.006 --> 07:21.337
Roll it.

08:15.561 --> 08:18.428
Our final nominee is:

08:19.599 --> 08:22.227
Nick Chapman for First Date.

08:22.869 --> 08:24.427
Yeah.

08:32.945 --> 08:35.174
-You must be Joey.
-Yes, sir.

08:35.581 --> 08:38.482
I suppose you have come
for my daughter.

08:38.683 --> 08:39.616
Yes, sir.

08:40.520 --> 08:42.283
Do you play chess?

08:42.822 --> 08:44.083
A little.

09:01.874 --> 09:04.206
I'll be right down, Joey.

09:07.780 --> 09:10.374
-It's your move.
-I just moved.

09:10.816 --> 09:12.750
Move again.

09:24.363 --> 09:27.059
What are you trying to pull?

09:27.400 --> 09:29.960
-Hi, Joey. Are you ready?
-Yeah.

09:30.169 --> 09:32.933
Where the hell
do you think you're going?!

09:33.472 --> 09:37.806
-We're going on a date, sir.
-You're not going anywhere...

09:38.177 --> 09:40.168
...ever again!

09:58.264 --> 10:00.289
And the winner is:

10:03.469 --> 10:05.960
If I can just get this thing open.

10:07.340 --> 10:09.205
Oh, here we are.

10:11.010 --> 10:13.877
Nick Chapman, for First Date.

10:29.829 --> 10:31.763
Congratulations.

10:38.304 --> 10:39.703
Wow.

10:42.274 --> 10:45.141
First, I'd like to thank
the institute...

10:45.344 --> 10:47.244
...for this great honor.

10:47.446 --> 10:49.812
I'd like to thank my mom and dad...

10:50.016 --> 10:53.144
...for buying me my first camera
when I was 4.

10:53.619 --> 10:55.416
I'd like to thank...

10:55.621 --> 10:58.590
...the cast and crew,
most of whom were made up...

10:58.791 --> 11:02.318
...of our fellow students.
I'd like to thank...

11:02.528 --> 11:03.790
...Emmet Sumner...

11:03.996 --> 11:07.864
...my friend and cinematographer,
for his great images.

11:08.067 --> 11:11.400
He couldn't be here,
he's at a Lamaze class.

11:11.604 --> 11:13.231
Most of all...

11:14.106 --> 11:15.596
...I wanna thank Susan...

11:16.542 --> 11:18.942
...for being there when I needed her.

11:20.012 --> 11:21.274
Thanks.

11:37.596 --> 11:41.760
-I liked that dance you did a lot.
-Oh, well....

11:42.268 --> 11:44.930
-You must be very proud.
-We are.

11:45.137 --> 11:48.106
Nick? Could I see you
for a second, please?

11:48.307 --> 11:49.740
Yeah.

11:53.512 --> 11:56.345
-Hello, my name is Allen Habel.
-Hi.

11:57.049 --> 12:00.416
-This is Lydia Johnson.
-Yes.

12:02.688 --> 12:07.250
-Oh, okay. So congratulations, sweetie.
-Thanks.

12:07.460 --> 12:09.121
See you.

12:09.628 --> 12:12.119
-May I call you Nick?
-Yeah.

12:13.099 --> 12:16.068
Brilliance. Absolute brilliance.

12:16.802 --> 12:20.397
-Thanks.
-Your film had a very unique quality.

12:21.207 --> 12:23.937
-Thank you.
-I think we can work together.

12:25.978 --> 12:29.311
Great. You know,
I'm completely available.

12:29.715 --> 12:33.515
-May I call you next week?
-Yeah. All week. Any day.

12:34.019 --> 12:35.384
Perfect.

12:37.156 --> 12:38.987
Call my secretary.

12:39.325 --> 12:40.815
I'll call you back.

12:41.026 --> 12:43.551
-Okay.
-Brilliance.

12:45.531 --> 12:47.431
-Brilliance.
-Okay.

12:51.570 --> 12:53.561
Who was that guy?

12:54.173 --> 12:56.641
He's from one of the studios.

13:13.592 --> 13:17.289
-Let's have a speech from Mr. Chapman.
-Speech!

13:17.496 --> 13:19.521
Speech! Speech!

13:20.065 --> 13:22.693
I would like to propose a toast...

13:23.869 --> 13:27.532
...to Emmet Sumner for his
brilliant cinematography.

13:27.973 --> 13:29.497
Well....

13:33.979 --> 13:37.142
Emmet, you should tell Nick
about your movie.

13:37.349 --> 13:38.748
What movie?

13:39.251 --> 13:42.982
It's this low-budget movie
this guy wants me to shoot.

13:44.023 --> 13:47.481
-What is it?
-It's this stupid movie.

13:47.960 --> 13:50.656
It's called Coffins From Hell.

13:53.098 --> 13:55.896
-What is it about?
-Coffins from hell.

13:56.702 --> 13:58.567
That's great, Emmet.

13:58.771 --> 14:02.070
-lt'll finally get him into the union.
-Yeah.

14:03.375 --> 14:05.343
So you don't seem excited.

14:06.011 --> 14:09.538
It's this piece of shit.
I mean, there's no story...

14:09.748 --> 14:14.242
...it's incredibly violent,
and I wouldn't want my kid to see it.

14:14.820 --> 14:18.551
-Don't do it. Why compromise?
-You make that sound easy.

14:18.757 --> 14:22.921
It is easy. Just do the work you want,
and stand by it.

14:23.128 --> 14:24.959
Yeah, I know you're right.

14:25.164 --> 14:28.292
We don't have that luxury.
Emmet's been trying...

14:28.500 --> 14:31.526
...to get in that union for six years.

14:31.737 --> 14:34.297
He'll get in when he does my movie.

14:34.506 --> 14:36.201
That would be great.

14:41.947 --> 14:45.007
Nick, congratulations.
This is Gail Murphy...

14:45.217 --> 14:47.913
...with IPF Talent Agency.
I saw your film.

14:48.120 --> 14:49.815
It's marvelous.

14:50.022 --> 14:52.923
Nick, Herb Bevis. Congratulations.

14:53.125 --> 14:57.289
Loved the film. Give me a call
regarding representation.

14:57.496 --> 15:00.954
Hello, Nick. This is Shawna
at the Clemsor Agency.

15:01.166 --> 15:05.762
Give us a call tomorrow or at
your earliest convenience. Thank you.

15:05.971 --> 15:09.930
Tim Freelander at Freelander-Morris.
I didn't see the film...

15:10.142 --> 15:14.636
...but I've heard it's sensational
and terrific. We ought to talk.

15:16.448 --> 15:17.745
Party of two.

15:19.785 --> 15:22.083
-Yes, sir?
-I'm meeting Mr. Sussman.

15:22.288 --> 15:24.119
He's right there, sir.

15:26.358 --> 15:27.848
Mr. Sussman?

15:30.562 --> 15:34.362
Mr. Sussman is my father,
and he lives in Miami Beach.

15:35.234 --> 15:37.361
It's Neil. Please sit.

15:39.505 --> 15:44.533
My wife and I come here all the time.
The gaucho steak is wonderful.

15:45.077 --> 15:46.942
Okay, sounds good.

15:55.321 --> 15:57.050
Are those contacts?

15:58.390 --> 15:59.652
No.

16:01.060 --> 16:03.893
I would kill for that color.

16:04.730 --> 16:07.528
I've always been stuck with hazel.

16:12.738 --> 16:15.639
Look, Nick,
I'm not gonna bullshit you.

16:15.908 --> 16:18.399
I don't know you or your work.

16:19.011 --> 16:24.506
But I think you're very talented,
and I'm never wrong about these things.

16:24.717 --> 16:26.878
Excuse me. Keith?

16:27.987 --> 16:31.423
Could I have another
Cointreau and sodie...

16:31.623 --> 16:36.390
...and send an almond torte
to the man in the white suit.

16:36.829 --> 16:38.091
Certainly.

16:39.732 --> 16:43.634
Look, Nick, I'm not going to
bullshit you...

16:43.836 --> 16:48.535
...because it's a waste of time,
and then it becomes like that thing.

16:53.245 --> 16:55.873
I'm not talking to you!

16:57.016 --> 16:58.677
I'll call you.

16:59.518 --> 17:01.952
I'm very, very aware...

17:02.154 --> 17:04.348
...you are seeing other agents.

17:04.857 --> 17:08.054
I think it's good that you are.
It's healthy.

17:08.527 --> 17:12.429
But this is the thing.
If you decide to sign with me...

17:12.631 --> 17:16.499
...you'll get more than an agent.
You'll get three people.

17:16.702 --> 17:20.866
You're gonna get an agent.
A mother. A father.

17:21.073 --> 17:22.869
A shoulder to cry on.

17:23.075 --> 17:27.307
Someone who knows this business
inside and out.

17:27.613 --> 17:31.413
If anyone ever tries to cross you,
I'll grab their balls...

17:31.617 --> 17:33.949
...and squeeze till they're dead.

17:34.153 --> 17:35.552
Excuse me.

17:36.288 --> 17:38.848
-Keith, did you send the torte?
-Yes.

17:39.091 --> 17:41.787
And what was his reaction?

17:42.728 --> 17:46.926
He seemed pleased, but beneath
the surface, I detected sadness.

17:53.839 --> 17:55.101
So...

17:55.441 --> 17:57.739
...think about
what I've been saying.

17:57.943 --> 18:03.279
I'd hate to see you walk into Allen
Habel's office with your pants down.

18:27.372 --> 18:28.634
Yes?

18:32.010 --> 18:34.035
Mr. Habel will see you now.

18:34.246 --> 18:35.611
Thank you.

18:42.054 --> 18:43.783
Are we in or out?

18:53.899 --> 18:56.595
Well, just tell me, are we in or out?

19:14.119 --> 19:17.919
Yeah, well, because I can call
Jerry right now.

19:18.123 --> 19:22.355
I don't want to call Jerry right now,
but I will if I have to.

19:24.496 --> 19:26.088
Look, El--

19:26.532 --> 19:30.992
Elliot, please, do not make this
a nightmare for me, okay?

19:43.715 --> 19:45.842
You like thimbles, Nick?

19:47.452 --> 19:49.818
Well, yeah.

19:50.022 --> 19:51.649
I guess I do.

19:52.257 --> 19:54.817
Thimbles have a very long history.

19:55.027 --> 19:58.622
All the way back to the Greeks.
Maybe even before.

20:05.237 --> 20:08.400
-Can I get you anything to drink?
-Coffee.

20:10.976 --> 20:15.538
Cheryl, can we have some coffee?
And tell Todd to come in, please.

20:15.747 --> 20:17.180
Yes, sir.

20:20.419 --> 20:23.047
So, did you grow up out here, Nick?

20:23.255 --> 20:26.713
-No, I'm from Ohio.
-My first wife is from lllinois.

20:28.560 --> 20:31.120
-How long you been out here?
-Two years.

20:32.431 --> 20:33.989
Incredible.

20:38.337 --> 20:40.601
Just put it right here, Cheryl.

20:43.475 --> 20:46.171
Nick, this my assistant, Todd Marvin.

20:46.378 --> 20:50.212
Nice to meet you. Heard great things
about your movie.

20:52.884 --> 20:54.317
Is anybody warm?

20:54.519 --> 20:56.214
A little.

21:00.259 --> 21:04.423
Cheryl, turn up the air conditioner.
And hold all my calls.

21:09.735 --> 21:11.327
So?

21:11.436 --> 21:12.528
So.

21:13.839 --> 21:15.136
What's next?

21:17.075 --> 21:19.339
Well, I'd like to make a film.

21:19.544 --> 21:22.411
Well, you've come to the right place.

21:34.259 --> 21:36.557
Tell me your movie, Nick.

21:38.030 --> 21:39.395
Okay.

21:40.065 --> 21:42.295
Okay. It's a love story.

21:43.935 --> 21:46.529
-It's a triangle, really.
-Even better.

21:47.606 --> 21:52.202
It's about how people change
for all kinds of reasons.

21:52.411 --> 21:55.380
But no two people do it
at the same time...

21:55.580 --> 21:58.913
...or for exactly the same
kinds of reasons.

22:03.221 --> 22:05.712
I'm not sure I follow exactly.

22:05.924 --> 22:08.893
It'll be more clear
when you hear the story.

22:09.094 --> 22:10.186
Shoot.

22:11.330 --> 22:12.592
Okay.

22:12.864 --> 22:17.494
The whole thing takes place during
a week spent in a country house...

22:17.703 --> 22:20.866
...in the middle of winter,
during a snowstorm.

22:25.310 --> 22:28.211
The three characters are Sharon...

22:28.413 --> 22:29.744
... George...

22:29.948 --> 22:31.347
...and Charlie.

22:31.550 --> 22:34.610
While they're by the fire,
it comes out...

22:34.820 --> 22:40.087
...Sharon had an affair with George
in the same house the previous summer.

22:40.292 --> 22:43.193
Why didn't you tell me
about this, Sharon?

22:43.395 --> 22:46.887
I wanted to. I really wanted to.

22:55.540 --> 22:56.802
Hi.

23:05.584 --> 23:06.881
Hello?

23:10.689 --> 23:11.986
Just be a second.

23:16.928 --> 23:19.590
If he's making that kind of trouble...

23:20.565 --> 23:22.430
...do we really need him?

23:25.337 --> 23:28.568
Then get rid of him.
We still on for Saturday?

23:33.011 --> 23:37.812
Sorry. We're making a picture in London
and everybody is flipping out.

23:41.987 --> 23:43.454
Continue.

23:46.391 --> 23:49.656
Now, Charlie can't believe
what he's hearing.

23:51.430 --> 23:55.389
Charlie.
Charlie, I wanted to tell you.

23:55.600 --> 23:56.931
I just couldn't.

23:57.135 --> 23:59.126
-Nick, can I interrupt?
-Sure.

23:59.871 --> 24:03.432
Do you think it would be possible
to have two women?

24:03.642 --> 24:04.631
Two women?

24:05.811 --> 24:08.541
Boy, it's really blowing out there.

24:10.449 --> 24:12.280
You mean, two couples?

24:13.285 --> 24:15.879
No, I mean two girls and a guy.

24:22.093 --> 24:23.355
Oh, okay.

24:25.697 --> 24:28.723
So Sharon and Charlie have the affair?

24:28.934 --> 24:32.495
No, the two women
would be having the affair.

24:39.044 --> 24:42.411
Well...yeah, I don't know.

24:42.881 --> 24:44.906
I really don't know.

24:45.116 --> 24:47.346
Well, you should think about it.

24:47.552 --> 24:51.511
I mean, there is something about
two women together....

24:52.224 --> 24:53.657
You know?

24:53.859 --> 24:55.383
It's true.

24:57.195 --> 25:00.790
I don't know. I guess it's possible.
I mean...

25:00.999 --> 25:03.331
...I know it's possible.

25:05.203 --> 25:07.194
Well, think about it.

25:08.139 --> 25:10.573
It could be an interesting twist.

25:14.412 --> 25:17.643
Excuse me, Mr. Habel,
Mr. Fleckman is here.

25:17.849 --> 25:20.340
Tell him I'll see him right away.

25:21.019 --> 25:23.783
I really have to
take this meeting. Well!

25:25.156 --> 25:27.590
-We're off to a good start.
-Great.

25:27.792 --> 25:28.759
Welcome.

25:28.960 --> 25:33.363
My wife and I are having a party
Saturday, we'd love you to come.

25:38.803 --> 25:40.202
Thanks.

25:44.509 --> 25:46.443
-Bye.
-Goodbye.

25:53.485 --> 25:58.013
You know, I really think it has to be
one woman and two men.

25:59.190 --> 26:00.487
You're right.

26:00.692 --> 26:03.923
With two women, it's a
whole different movie.

26:04.429 --> 26:06.226
I agree. Tell him that.

26:06.765 --> 26:08.790
I will. I'll tell him that.

26:39.264 --> 26:41.732
Hi. Come on.

26:42.133 --> 26:43.896
No?

26:44.102 --> 26:46.161
Okay. Bye.

26:59.017 --> 27:02.680
Do you think it would be possible
to have two women?

27:02.887 --> 27:03.979
Two women?

27:04.189 --> 27:05.679
Two women.

27:08.326 --> 27:09.452
Nick.

27:12.063 --> 27:13.394
Honey.

27:16.501 --> 27:17.832
Nick.

27:18.336 --> 27:19.667
Hi.

27:19.871 --> 27:21.304
Honey.

27:22.874 --> 27:25.604
-This is my wife. Polo, this is Nick.
-Hi.

27:25.810 --> 27:27.368
-Hi.
-And....

27:28.380 --> 27:29.847
Susan Rawlings.

27:30.048 --> 27:32.949
-Hi, how do you do?
-Hi.

27:33.585 --> 27:35.416
Mindy, Quang.

27:36.287 --> 27:39.085
Kids, your father is talking to you.

27:41.693 --> 27:45.561
This is Mindy. And my adopted
Vietnamese son, Quang Da.

27:45.764 --> 27:48.062
-Hi.
-Hi.

27:50.035 --> 27:51.866
Okay.

27:52.070 --> 27:53.628
Good kids.

27:53.838 --> 27:55.965
Nick, tell me, what do you do?

27:56.174 --> 27:58.267
Nick is a promising director.

27:59.577 --> 28:00.839
Nice.

28:01.046 --> 28:03.071
Nice, huh?

28:07.986 --> 28:09.954
-Can I get you a drink?
-Sure.

28:10.155 --> 28:11.884
Oh, yeah. Come on, Sue.

28:12.090 --> 28:13.887
Tell me, what do you do?

28:14.092 --> 28:16.652
-I'm a homemaker.
-She's an architect.

28:16.861 --> 28:21.093
I'd love you to look at my house.
I'm having it completely redone.

28:21.266 --> 28:22.460
Again.

28:27.405 --> 28:29.805
So we'll have a drink.

28:30.075 --> 28:31.474
Spritzers?

28:31.676 --> 28:34.201
-Yeah.
-Two.

28:36.881 --> 28:40.180
Andres. Andres Vargiak, Nick Chapman.

28:40.385 --> 28:42.148
Oh, wow.

28:43.354 --> 28:45.447
I'm a big fan of your work.

28:45.657 --> 28:48.421
I've seen every film you've ever shot.

28:53.932 --> 28:57.026
Maybe you can get Andres
to shoot your movie.

28:57.936 --> 29:00.063
That would be great.

29:02.240 --> 29:03.969
Nice to see you.

29:04.175 --> 29:06.643
Nice to meet you. Excuse me.

29:08.213 --> 29:10.443
Yeah, it's a pleasure.

29:10.648 --> 29:12.639
Andres Vargiak. I'm just saying.

29:12.917 --> 29:14.976
Gretchen.

29:16.755 --> 29:18.017
Come here.

29:20.792 --> 29:23.090
I'll be back in a minute.

29:26.765 --> 29:28.027
Hi.

29:28.399 --> 29:30.458
Everybody, this is Gretchen.

29:30.668 --> 29:34.104
-Susan. Polo, you know, of course.
-Welcome.

29:34.305 --> 29:35.670
-This is Nick.
-Hi.

29:35.874 --> 29:39.002
-Hi.
-Nick is a promising young director.

29:39.444 --> 29:40.934
Oh, really?

29:41.146 --> 29:44.946
Come on, Sue. Come upstairs.
Let me show you what I did.

29:45.984 --> 29:47.349
Come on, Sue.

29:47.585 --> 29:49.576
I'll see you guys later.

29:55.460 --> 29:58.429
So are you an actress?

29:58.630 --> 30:03.329
Yes. I'm on a series.
But I'd really rather be doing movies.

30:03.701 --> 30:07.262
-Are you making a movie for Allen?
-We're talking about it.

30:07.438 --> 30:08.871
That's great.

30:09.207 --> 30:11.471
Can you tell me about it?

30:11.676 --> 30:14.543
-You really want to hear about it?
-Yeah.

30:14.746 --> 30:16.008
Okay.

30:16.214 --> 30:20.310
It takes place in a country house
in a snowstorm.

30:20.518 --> 30:23.681
When I say snowstorm,
I don't mean snowstorm....

30:28.092 --> 30:31.823
Of course, this carpeting's going.
Allen's ex put it in.

30:32.030 --> 30:36.399
You know, Miss No Taste herself.
I started collecting fine art.

30:36.601 --> 30:40.401
I put in a bid for Marc Chagall's
David and Bathsheba.

30:40.605 --> 30:45.008
I'm hanging it there. Mind if l
tell you how much this house cost?

30:45.210 --> 30:46.472
No.

30:49.080 --> 30:51.776
Four point six mil.

30:51.983 --> 30:53.450
Really?

30:54.452 --> 30:56.249
And change.

30:57.589 --> 30:58.988
Excuse me.

31:01.793 --> 31:03.488
Hello?

31:03.695 --> 31:05.663
Oh, hi, Ma.

31:06.130 --> 31:08.223
We're having a party.

31:08.800 --> 31:10.859
Just business people.

31:12.470 --> 31:16.463
So then Sharon and Charlie
decide to go out in the snow...

31:16.674 --> 31:18.198
...and build a snowman.

31:18.409 --> 31:19.933
Wait. I'm confused.

31:20.278 --> 31:22.246
So you have two couples?

31:22.447 --> 31:26.508
No. Sharon and the other woman
would be having the affair.

31:28.086 --> 31:30.111
That must be Allen's idea.

31:31.055 --> 31:32.750
How did you know?

31:34.993 --> 31:37.120
That's Allen's thing.

31:37.328 --> 31:39.660
He just likes that.

31:47.739 --> 31:49.570
What do you like?

31:54.245 --> 31:56.270
What do I like?

32:03.821 --> 32:06.949
Have you thought about
anyone for Sharon yet?

32:09.961 --> 32:13.294
For Sharon? No. Not really.

32:15.266 --> 32:17.131
Think of me.

32:32.784 --> 32:34.046
What's wrong?

32:35.920 --> 32:37.512
Nothing.

32:47.532 --> 32:51.525
I really liked your idea about
having it become two women.

32:51.736 --> 32:55.638
I thought about it and I think
it would be a challenge...

32:55.807 --> 32:58.970
...to make a love story
between two women work.

32:59.143 --> 33:00.405
Good.

33:00.745 --> 33:02.007
But....

33:03.047 --> 33:04.309
But what?

33:06.517 --> 33:10.214
But I really feel it has to be...

33:10.421 --> 33:13.515
...two men and one woman. I really do.

33:27.739 --> 33:29.070
Fine. Okay.

33:29.273 --> 33:33.403
It's not that your idea wouldn't work.
It's a great idea.

33:33.611 --> 33:36.808
-It's just, for this movie--
-Nick? Nick!

33:36.981 --> 33:40.144
Nick, you can stop drilling.
You struck oil.

33:41.986 --> 33:45.422
Okay, great. Terrific.

33:45.757 --> 33:48.021
But, I do have a problem.

33:48.226 --> 33:49.853
What's that?

33:50.828 --> 33:52.693
-Snow.
-What about it?

33:52.864 --> 33:57.130
-It's always snowing.
-There doesn't have to always be snow.

33:57.301 --> 34:00.532
Not the snow. The winter.
It's depressing.

34:03.241 --> 34:04.936
What if...

34:05.576 --> 34:07.635
...it took place...

34:13.751 --> 34:17.516
...in the summer at the beach?

34:19.623 --> 34:20.955
Interesting.

34:25.630 --> 34:30.465
Well, it changes the whole
concept of the film.

34:32.003 --> 34:34.437
I don't think so. Not really.

34:34.639 --> 34:38.699
The interaction among the characters
remains the same.

34:39.077 --> 34:42.444
The only thing different
is the location.

34:47.251 --> 34:49.344
-Look what I found.
-Where?

34:49.520 --> 34:53.183
-ln the attic.
-Didn't even know there was an attic.

34:53.391 --> 34:57.327
We've come here for 1 5 summers
and never knew there's an attic?

34:57.495 --> 34:59.827
-lsn't that weird?
-Yeah.

35:00.331 --> 35:01.958
Let's open it.

35:02.633 --> 35:04.965
Whoa, time out here.

35:05.603 --> 35:08.663
-Nick, how old are these people?
-Early 40s.

35:09.073 --> 35:10.665
Oh, boy!

35:14.011 --> 35:17.970
-What's wrong?
-Well, that is a bad age, Nick.

35:18.149 --> 35:23.177
The people who buy tickets, for better
or worse, are between the ages of--

35:23.387 --> 35:25.753
Fourteen and 24.

35:25.957 --> 35:27.720
So?

35:28.126 --> 35:32.961
If kids want to see people in their
40s, they don't go to the movies.

35:33.164 --> 35:35.689
They go home, look at their parents.

35:36.100 --> 35:38.159
It's true.

35:56.354 --> 35:58.254
I'm a little confused.

35:58.856 --> 36:02.019
No, no, you're not confused.

36:02.226 --> 36:04.660
It's nervous energy.
You're excited!

36:05.163 --> 36:06.425
Really?

36:06.764 --> 36:09.426
Yeah! Damn straight!

36:09.634 --> 36:11.795
Now...

36:12.770 --> 36:17.104
...I want you to get out of my office
and write me a movie!

36:17.275 --> 36:19.937
Okay, great! Thanks.

36:47.939 --> 36:49.463
Gretchen?

36:50.074 --> 36:53.134
Nick Chapman.
We met at Allen Habel's party.

36:55.112 --> 36:57.273
Of course! Are you on the lot?

36:57.848 --> 37:00.817
Looks like I will be.
I just made a deal.

37:01.018 --> 37:05.978
-They're gonna let me write a movie.
-Congratulations! That's great.

37:06.190 --> 37:09.853
Thanks, I'm really,
really excited about it.

37:11.128 --> 37:13.119
That's a....

37:13.564 --> 37:18.263
I'm playing an undercover agent
in Switzerland this week.

37:21.138 --> 37:25.370
Want to come in my trailer
while I take off my makeup?

37:37.655 --> 37:42.718
You know, that's very nice,
but I should probably get going.

37:42.927 --> 37:45.361
Oh, that's too bad.

37:45.563 --> 37:47.827
Well, it was really nice
seeing you.

37:47.999 --> 37:50.866
Yeah, it was great to see you too.

37:51.068 --> 37:52.729
I'll see you around the lot.

37:52.937 --> 37:54.461
See you around.

37:57.074 --> 37:59.042
Nick?

38:00.244 --> 38:04.374
Would you like to come to a party
with me on Saturday night?

38:05.316 --> 38:07.511
You mean Saturday night?

38:08.853 --> 38:10.343
How about it?

38:18.996 --> 38:20.964
Taste this, would you?

38:22.833 --> 38:25.233
All right. Yeah, it's good.

38:25.403 --> 38:29.499
It needs something.
One of those herby things.

38:29.707 --> 38:33.234
-How about Saturday?
-What about Saturday?

38:33.778 --> 38:35.541
Are we on for bowling?

38:35.746 --> 38:38.340
Saturday....
I'm working Saturday.

38:38.549 --> 38:39.982
Night?

38:40.184 --> 38:42.414
It's a party, but it's for work.

38:42.620 --> 38:46.784
I met an actress at a party.
She asked me to another party.

38:46.991 --> 38:51.394
I don't even know if I'm going.
I haven't told Susan yet.

38:51.595 --> 38:54.155
-Susan is not invited?
-No, no, no.

38:54.365 --> 38:58.199
It's work. But it's a party.
It's a work-party thing.

39:01.372 --> 39:03.101
What?

39:08.312 --> 39:09.870
What would you do?

39:10.081 --> 39:12.174
What would I do, or...

39:12.383 --> 39:14.977
...what would Jenny do
if she found out?

39:15.186 --> 39:16.585
Found out what?

39:16.787 --> 39:21.190
Aren't you asking if you should
get your oil changed?

39:21.392 --> 39:23.758
Make the beast with two backs?

39:23.961 --> 39:26.862
Park the pink Mustang
up a side street?

39:27.031 --> 39:29.829
-What?
-I'm out of colorful phrases.

39:30.034 --> 39:32.298
No, wait, wait.

39:33.070 --> 39:35.630
I can't believe you're saying that!

39:35.840 --> 39:38.468
It's just a party.

39:39.143 --> 39:44.080
It's a party, for chrissake.
That pisses me off. It's really sexist!

39:46.650 --> 39:48.880
Well, I'm sorry. My mistake.

39:49.086 --> 39:53.386
-Do you guys need any help?
-What are you boys up to?

40:07.705 --> 40:09.832
Great car.

40:12.843 --> 40:15.175
I'm living with someone.

40:36.167 --> 40:39.432
Toby! Nick, I'll be right back.

40:44.508 --> 40:45.998
Hi.

40:46.177 --> 40:47.337
Hi.

40:47.545 --> 40:52.949
-Are you a friend of Toby?
-I'm a friend of a friend of Toby's.

40:54.985 --> 40:57.215
Excuse me. I'm just gonna....

41:05.529 --> 41:07.394
Is that Chapman?

41:07.598 --> 41:09.566
-I thought so.
-Jonathan, hi.

41:09.733 --> 41:12.395
What are you doing here?
Friend of Toby's?

41:12.570 --> 41:15.232
Actually, I'm a friend of a friend.

41:15.439 --> 41:16.872
How nice.

41:18.309 --> 41:22.370
-What've you been doing?
-Oh, you know. This and that.

41:22.713 --> 41:25.011
Nothing concrete?

41:25.749 --> 41:28.217
Actually, I just made a deal.

41:28.419 --> 41:30.649
-Oh, with?
-Allen Habel.

41:31.388 --> 41:33.788
Welcome to the club.

41:34.458 --> 41:36.323
You have a deal with Allen?

41:36.594 --> 41:41.122
I have three deals, with three studios.
Two to direct, one to produce.

41:41.298 --> 41:43.732
I'm also halfway through my novel.

41:45.236 --> 41:48.262
How's that cancer cure coming?

41:48.472 --> 41:50.997
Don't be bitter, Chapman.

42:36.287 --> 42:37.549
Nick. Hi.

42:38.355 --> 42:40.323
-Hi.
-Hi.

42:42.493 --> 42:45.894
-Where were you?
-At another party, down the beach.

42:46.096 --> 42:49.463
-So, what do you want to do now?
-Well, l....

42:50.334 --> 42:52.632
I gotta get home.

42:52.803 --> 42:56.534
Oh, come on.
I want you to meet my friends.

42:56.740 --> 42:58.935
I gotta get home.

43:00.277 --> 43:04.646
Okay. Do you want to drive my car?

43:47.458 --> 43:48.720
Jesus!

43:49.493 --> 43:52.053
-Where were you?
-I went out.

43:52.363 --> 43:54.888
I know. That was five hours ago.

43:55.199 --> 43:57.030
I went to a party.

43:59.536 --> 44:01.436
With Gretchen Gorman.

44:03.307 --> 44:05.241
Who's Gretchen Gorman?

44:07.411 --> 44:08.673
Susan--

44:08.946 --> 44:14.009
Don't come any closer, unless you wanna
walk funny for the rest of your life.

44:16.253 --> 44:18.517
She's just an actress, baby.

44:18.956 --> 44:21.516
-She's a bimbo.
-She's an actress.

44:23.761 --> 44:24.989
Okay.

44:25.162 --> 44:26.720
A bimbo actress.

44:26.897 --> 44:28.990
A no-talent, bimbo actress.

44:29.166 --> 44:34.468
A big, fat, no-talent, bimbo actress
with hair on her back and bad gums.

44:37.107 --> 44:38.938
I forgive you, Nick.

44:40.110 --> 44:41.975
I get jealous.

44:42.613 --> 44:44.376
Girls get that way.

44:45.115 --> 44:46.377
I....

44:47.785 --> 44:50.583
I love you, you big lug.

44:54.625 --> 44:56.559
You should have told me.

44:56.727 --> 45:01.824
Told you what? I just went to a party.
It's not like I slept with her.

45:04.034 --> 45:05.592
Do you want to?

45:10.140 --> 45:11.732
This is stupid.

45:11.942 --> 45:15.070
It was an industry party, okay?

45:15.379 --> 45:17.347
Do you know what that means?

45:19.016 --> 45:20.950
Obviously, you don't.

45:23.787 --> 45:25.345
Obviously.

45:31.628 --> 45:34.654
-So where'd you leave it?
-We left it a mess.

45:34.832 --> 45:37.494
I don't know.
Everything's changing.

45:37.668 --> 45:42.833
People he barely knew in film school
are calling him and asking for jobs.

45:43.741 --> 45:46.938
They're all telling him
how talented he is.

45:48.645 --> 45:51.011
It's as if...

45:51.181 --> 45:55.948
...he feels he has to change to become
the person they're talking about.

45:58.889 --> 46:02.052
Have you tried beaning him
with a rolling pin?

46:02.226 --> 46:03.523
No.

46:03.727 --> 46:06.787
Works with Emmet.
Come on, let's buy you lunch.

46:06.964 --> 46:08.226
Okay.

46:18.976 --> 46:22.377
-Why are you looking at me that way?
-What way?

46:23.080 --> 46:24.945
You know what way.

46:26.083 --> 46:28.745
I don't know what you're
talking about.

46:34.758 --> 46:38.353
You know, maybe I need
to think about things.

46:40.464 --> 46:43.058
-What things?
-Things. I don't know.

46:43.233 --> 46:45.667
Things, like maybe...

46:46.637 --> 46:49.162
...we should be
seeing other people.

46:53.510 --> 46:57.037
"We." No, this isn't about "we," Nick.

46:58.415 --> 47:00.349
This is about you.

47:00.984 --> 47:04.147
I'm not interested in seeing
anybody else.

47:05.389 --> 47:08.620
When you decide to do
what you want, let me know.

47:08.792 --> 47:11.386
But let me know before you do it.

47:12.329 --> 47:14.024
I'm going out.

47:20.470 --> 47:21.767
Shit!

47:23.907 --> 47:26.501
Goddamn it!

50:12.976 --> 50:14.341
Yes?

50:14.711 --> 50:17.703
-ls Gretchen here?
-No, she's not here.

50:19.182 --> 50:20.945
Do you know where she is?

50:21.818 --> 50:24.446
She went someplace
with her boyfriend.

50:35.232 --> 50:36.494
Hi.

50:39.369 --> 50:40.631
Hi.

50:47.277 --> 50:50.075
Look, I've been thinking.

50:52.816 --> 50:54.511
And I just....

50:54.684 --> 50:56.549
I don't think I can...

50:56.953 --> 50:59.012
...do this anymore.

51:03.126 --> 51:06.061
So I'm leaving.

51:08.698 --> 51:12.600
That's incredible, because
I was thinking the same thing.

51:12.803 --> 51:17.263
I mean, we can't keep living
like this. It's....

51:19.976 --> 51:22.945
But I think I should be
the one to leave.

51:26.616 --> 51:27.947
Fine.

51:31.455 --> 51:32.786
Leave.

51:44.668 --> 51:47.569
-What do you do?
-I'm a director.

51:49.072 --> 51:52.405
-You ever see Rocky Mountain Serenade?
-No.

51:52.576 --> 51:54.066
I directed it.

51:54.811 --> 51:57.507
That was Red Reardon's first picture.

51:57.681 --> 52:01.139
I made him a star. A big star.

52:01.585 --> 52:05.885
Then he turned around
and crapped in my face. Literally.

52:12.629 --> 52:17.965
It's $1 200 a month. I want first, last
and a nonrefundable cleaning fee.

52:19.669 --> 52:21.830
Can I take this carpet up?

52:22.539 --> 52:24.769
I just put it down.

52:26.910 --> 52:30.311
-Do you know who used to live here?
-No, I don't.

52:30.480 --> 52:32.914
Take a guess. Very famous.

52:36.219 --> 52:39.245
-Clark Gable?
-Nope. Guess again.

52:39.656 --> 52:42.352
-I really--
-Take a guess.

52:43.560 --> 52:45.926
-Marilyn Monroe?
-No.

52:46.263 --> 52:48.595
-Errol Flynn?
-No.

52:50.200 --> 52:52.031
-You give up?
-I give up.

52:52.769 --> 52:54.862
Chuck Barris.

52:59.209 --> 53:01.541
The Gong Show guy.

53:06.917 --> 53:11.718
I've done a breakdown, and I see
the film being shot in eight weeks.

53:11.888 --> 53:13.583
That sounds right.

53:14.658 --> 53:19.459
You should put in a scene near the end
where they throw clamshells.

53:19.629 --> 53:22.029
-I think that would be great.
-Yeah?

53:22.799 --> 53:25.962
-I'm wondering about--
-The lighthouse scene?

53:26.136 --> 53:29.469
I am wondering about that,
but I was referring to--

53:29.639 --> 53:33.439
The scene on the catamaran.
That's my favorite.

53:33.610 --> 53:35.908
No, but I love the catamaran scene.

53:36.079 --> 53:40.209
That should be shot at sunset
so you get that golden, orangey--

53:40.383 --> 53:42.180
"Miller Time" look.

53:42.352 --> 53:44.343
-Yeah.
-Exactly.

53:44.521 --> 53:47.649
Yeah, except it's gonna be
in black and white.

53:47.824 --> 53:51.487
-What's gonna be in black and white?
-The movie.

53:51.728 --> 53:53.525
-The whole movie?
-Yeah.

53:53.697 --> 53:58.191
If you shoot it in black and white
they'll just colorize it anyway.

53:58.368 --> 54:01.166
Theaters don't show
black-and-white movies.

54:01.338 --> 54:06.173
They don't have the right projectors.
All the projectors are in color.

54:07.277 --> 54:09.336
-That's true.
-That's not--

54:09.512 --> 54:11.980
How do you see music fitting in?

54:12.148 --> 54:13.376
Well....

54:14.017 --> 54:16.212
I was thinking no music.

54:19.689 --> 54:22.487
-No music where?
-No music at all.

54:22.659 --> 54:26.356
-What do you mean?
-You gotta have music.

54:27.130 --> 54:31.328
Well, maybe some music.
Just not wall-to-wall music.

54:31.801 --> 54:34.326
Who's talking about
wall-to-wall music?

54:34.504 --> 54:39.464
We're talking about 1 5 or 20 good
pop hits, at most. Isn't that right?

54:39.643 --> 54:41.634
-Right.
-Exactly.

54:42.879 --> 54:44.813
Well, maybe a couple songs.

54:44.981 --> 54:48.678
Well, good. Now, you think
about these changes, Nick.

54:48.852 --> 54:51.377
And get right into the rewrites.

54:52.422 --> 54:55.255
-I think we have a movie.
-All right.

54:56.993 --> 54:59.518
It is so good, Nick.

55:00.330 --> 55:01.695
Thanks.

55:44.607 --> 55:48.407
I'm sorry I was late,
but the traffic was just murder.

55:48.578 --> 55:49.943
It's good to see you.

55:50.113 --> 55:53.742
I'm sorry I haven't gotten over.
Things have been crazy.

55:53.917 --> 55:57.011
It's the same at our house,
with the baby.

55:57.187 --> 56:00.486
-How's she doing?
-She's just incredible.

56:00.657 --> 56:03.990
We've got a nickname for her.
We call her Moochie.

56:04.160 --> 56:07.891
You're kidding? That's great.
Listen to this.

56:09.299 --> 56:10.857
Yeah! That's great.

56:11.034 --> 56:13.093
You believe that bottom end?

56:13.269 --> 56:16.397
-Where did you get this car?
-I'm leasing it.

56:17.874 --> 56:21.901
Did I tell you I'm looking at a house?
Don't you laugh.

56:22.145 --> 56:23.976
It's in Beverly Hills.

56:26.015 --> 56:30.042
I don't know if I can afford it.
But I don't know if I can't.

56:30.420 --> 56:34.015
-What do you want to do?
-I thought we'd drive around.

56:34.190 --> 56:36.988
-We could get a burger.
-Whatever you want.

56:37.160 --> 56:39.025
I just thought maybe--

56:39.562 --> 56:40.824
Sorry.

56:41.431 --> 56:42.693
Yeah?

56:45.568 --> 56:47.593
Okay, hold on a sec.

56:54.310 --> 56:56.835
-Sorry. I gotta take this.
-Go ahead.

56:57.013 --> 56:58.742
I mean....

57:05.388 --> 57:06.719
Sorry.

57:15.965 --> 57:18.195
Hello. Yeah.

57:38.488 --> 57:39.750
Bye.

57:40.957 --> 57:43.016
Emmet. Emmet.

57:54.737 --> 57:57.706
I'm sorry about that,
but it happens.

57:58.208 --> 58:00.608
-How's your rewrite coming?
-Rewrite?

58:00.777 --> 58:03.007
We start shooting in six weeks.

58:05.748 --> 58:07.215
Really?

58:11.120 --> 58:14.089
I fought for you.
I wanted you to shoot this.

58:14.257 --> 58:18.057
-You don't have to explain.
-You were the only one on my list.

58:18.228 --> 58:20.287
Nick, really, it's all right.

58:20.463 --> 58:23.261
They're making me use Andres Vargiak.

58:24.133 --> 58:25.532
He's good.

58:25.969 --> 58:30.235
I know, he's great. But I wanted you.

58:39.382 --> 58:41.373
Well, here we are.

58:41.985 --> 58:43.782
Yeah, so we are.

58:45.388 --> 58:47.447
Yeah, well, I'll see you.

58:47.857 --> 58:50.883
-Okay. I'll call you.
-Yeah.

58:51.261 --> 58:52.626
Ciao!

59:02.405 --> 59:04.669
-That was quick.
-Yeah.

59:04.841 --> 59:07.776
I thought you guys were having lunch.

59:07.944 --> 59:10.037
No, I guess not.

59:10.513 --> 59:13.277
You wanna go see Daddy? Yeah.

59:13.449 --> 59:15.440
What about the film?

59:15.618 --> 59:17.882
I don't think it's gonna work out.

59:18.288 --> 59:22.816
-Lucy, let's go make Daddy a sandwich.
-You gonna help Mama?

59:55.525 --> 59:58.551
Look, I am not gonna dick you around.

59:58.728 --> 01:00:01.697
Because I have
way too much respect for you.

01:00:01.864 --> 01:00:04.332
I'm saying that not as your agent.

01:00:04.601 --> 01:00:09.334
Although, God, that has given me
an insane amount of pleasure.

01:00:09.505 --> 01:00:12.838
And I don't mean that
as just show-biz bullshit.

01:00:13.009 --> 01:00:17.469
Where you hear talk on the street,
and it becomes, like, that thing.

01:00:17.647 --> 01:00:19.342
What are you saying?

01:00:20.617 --> 01:00:23.108
I'm saying that your project is dead.

01:00:24.187 --> 01:00:26.212
What are you talking about?

01:00:26.389 --> 01:00:30.655
Anything that Allen
was involved with is dead.

01:00:32.328 --> 01:00:36.321
Whoever takes over doesn't
want blood on their hands.

01:00:36.499 --> 01:00:41.402
They want, with all due respect, to
distance themselves from the stench.

01:00:41.571 --> 01:00:43.971
So just let it blow over.

01:00:44.140 --> 01:00:49.305
And in a couple of months, you'll come
in and we'll have a really good talk.

01:00:49.479 --> 01:00:52.778
A couple of months?
Neil, I don't have any money!

01:00:55.952 --> 01:00:57.977
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

01:00:58.154 --> 01:01:03.990
If you could just get me a meeting
with the new studio head.

01:01:04.560 --> 01:01:07.120
If I could just talk to him...

01:01:08.164 --> 01:01:10.496
...I'm sure I could convince him.

01:01:13.803 --> 01:01:17.398
I'm convinced that all the
commercial elements are there.

01:01:17.573 --> 01:01:23.136
The product has demographic viability
in a package for the youth market...

01:01:23.312 --> 01:01:26.440
...and beyond. Way beyond.

01:01:27.950 --> 01:01:33.047
Nick, I've always had major
reservations about this.

01:01:35.491 --> 01:01:38.085
I know, I know. Me too. Exactly.

01:01:38.261 --> 01:01:42.095
Lori, that is very perceptive,
but what if....

01:01:43.599 --> 01:01:44.861
What if....

01:01:45.201 --> 01:01:48.693
What if we were to leave it
at the beach, right?

01:01:48.871 --> 01:01:52.500
Only it's a bunch of college guys
living in the house.

01:01:52.675 --> 01:01:55.872
They've rented it,
and they're having this party.

01:01:56.045 --> 01:01:59.572
And suddenly, without anyone
realizing it, three...

01:01:59.749 --> 01:02:02.877
...stewardesses show up
on their doorstep.

01:02:03.352 --> 01:02:04.683
Party!

01:02:26.542 --> 01:02:27.804
Or...

01:02:28.644 --> 01:02:31.772
...the three stewardesses
are actually ghosts.

01:02:31.981 --> 01:02:34.814
And they've been
living in the attic.

01:02:34.984 --> 01:02:39.011
Ghosts by night,
stews by day, and...

01:02:39.188 --> 01:02:43.215
...they could be naked,
and the guys can't even see them...

01:02:43.392 --> 01:02:49.729
...and the bikinis are bouncing around
without even bodies in them.

01:02:52.602 --> 01:02:54.126
Or....

01:03:07.617 --> 01:03:11.644
I'm not just gonna stand by
and watch them do this to you.

01:03:12.522 --> 01:03:14.046
I'm just not.

01:03:17.026 --> 01:03:22.259
I made a promise to love you
no matter what.

01:03:24.534 --> 01:03:26.764
I want to be with you.

01:03:28.471 --> 01:03:32.100
And I want to hold you,
and comfort you.

01:03:33.609 --> 01:03:38.103
Until they see what I saw in you
on that first night we met.

01:03:42.151 --> 01:03:43.584
Please.

01:03:45.154 --> 01:03:46.644
Please say that you--

01:03:47.423 --> 01:03:49.823
Oh, that must be my agent.

01:03:50.126 --> 01:03:53.095
-Was it better that time?
-Better. You could--

01:03:53.262 --> 01:03:55.560
If I get the part, it's thanks to you.

01:03:55.731 --> 01:03:59.394
-What about my movie?
-How's my mascara? Never mind.

01:04:06.709 --> 01:04:08.336
-Hi.
-Hi.

01:04:09.378 --> 01:04:13.610
I'll just be a sec.
Oh, Nick. Meet my new agent, Carl.

01:04:14.717 --> 01:04:16.742
Yeah, we've met. Hi, Carl.

01:04:17.954 --> 01:04:20.320
Nick, I thought that was you.

01:04:21.090 --> 01:04:24.025
I heard about your deal falling apart.

01:04:26.996 --> 01:04:30.591
Well, it's not definite yet.

01:04:30.833 --> 01:04:32.528
Oh, really? Well...

01:04:32.702 --> 01:04:34.693
...that's not what I heard.

01:04:37.406 --> 01:04:40.671
Nick. Carl and l, we have to talk.

01:04:42.812 --> 01:04:44.905
Privately, if you don't mind.

01:04:47.783 --> 01:04:52.447
Do you think we could, I don't know,
see a movie or something later?

01:04:54.123 --> 01:04:57.559
No. I think I might
be doing something.

01:05:13.709 --> 01:05:18.009
It doesn't have to be at the beach,
or have three stewardesses.

01:05:18.180 --> 01:05:20.774
It could be two stewardesses, or four.

01:05:20.950 --> 01:05:25.944
They don't even have to be ghosts,
if you don't like the metaphysical--

01:05:28.257 --> 01:05:32.557
What does the public,
the general public, want to see?

01:05:33.763 --> 01:05:35.856
-I don't know.
-I do.

01:05:36.232 --> 01:05:38.393
Here at Brown Entertainment...

01:05:38.567 --> 01:05:44.767
...we take the scientific approach
to moviemaking: market research.

01:05:46.409 --> 01:05:49.867
Buddy pictures.
They wanna see buddy pictures.

01:05:50.046 --> 01:05:51.479
Now...

01:05:51.647 --> 01:05:57.347
...who do you think are the two most
beloved figures in American history?

01:05:58.287 --> 01:05:59.652
Beats me.

01:06:01.023 --> 01:06:04.220
Babe Ruth and Abe Lincoln.

01:06:12.702 --> 01:06:17.901
Hey, Abe, how's that bat coming?
I wanna hit me some baseballs.

01:06:19.241 --> 01:06:21.232
It's all done, Babe.

01:06:24.280 --> 01:06:26.874
She's a beaut. Thanks, kid.

01:06:27.817 --> 01:06:30.377
Just make sure the Yankees win.

01:06:46.535 --> 01:06:48.560
That's the Babe for you.

01:06:49.338 --> 01:06:51.101
What do you think?

01:06:51.607 --> 01:06:54.770
Well, you know, that's a....

01:06:55.644 --> 01:06:58.078
-That's a good idea.
-Good.

01:06:59.048 --> 01:07:00.481
Now...

01:07:00.649 --> 01:07:03.641
...how much money
have you got to invest?

01:07:25.641 --> 01:07:27.905
All right, Nick, looks good.

01:07:30.479 --> 01:07:34.575
I see you're a director.
Jimmy, our busboy, is a director.

01:07:37.887 --> 01:07:41.516
I could start today after 4 p.m.

01:07:42.058 --> 01:07:47.257
You could start, if I needed a waiter.
I got 70 people on a waiting list.

01:07:47.663 --> 01:07:49.130
I'll tell you what.

01:07:49.298 --> 01:07:52.790
You give me a call in about six weeks.

01:07:52.968 --> 01:07:55.334
-Okay, Nick.
-Thanks.

01:08:07.450 --> 01:08:10.817
Watch it! You're knocking off
all my magnets.

01:08:10.986 --> 01:08:12.214
Sorry.

01:08:12.388 --> 01:08:14.822
Jerk. Pull!

01:08:20.496 --> 01:08:24.330
Hello. Is this Mrs. Stein?

01:08:24.667 --> 01:08:29.001
Hi, I'm calling to tell you about
our brand-new service.

01:08:29.171 --> 01:08:32.265
How many times have you
said to yourself:

01:08:32.441 --> 01:08:35.535
"My phone smells,
but what can I do about it?"

01:08:35.711 --> 01:08:41.274
Our revolutionary phone-cleaning
service will solve this problem--

01:08:41.450 --> 01:08:44.613
Mrs. Stein? Hello? Hello?

01:09:33.435 --> 01:09:34.925
I love you, Suz.

01:09:35.104 --> 01:09:36.832
I love you too.

01:10:19.114 --> 01:10:20.411
Hello.

01:10:20.749 --> 01:10:23.274
Hi, sweetie, how are you?

01:10:24.119 --> 01:10:27.782
-Hi, Mom, how you doing?
-How's the movie going?

01:10:28.357 --> 01:10:32.726
We had a little delay. We haven't
actually started shooting yet.

01:10:32.895 --> 01:10:35.921
Everybody wants to know
when it's coming out.

01:10:36.098 --> 01:10:37.861
Yeah. Well....

01:10:39.201 --> 01:10:40.828
Tell them next Christmas.

01:10:42.204 --> 01:10:43.796
At Radio City?

01:10:44.640 --> 01:10:46.665
Yeah. Yeah, Mom, Radio City.

01:10:47.443 --> 01:10:51.607
Listen, I'm just on my way out.
I've got a production meeting.

01:10:51.780 --> 01:10:54.146
Could you tell Dad I said hi?

01:10:54.617 --> 01:10:57.848
Are you and Susan
coming home for Christmas?

01:10:59.922 --> 01:11:02.186
No, we....

01:11:02.591 --> 01:11:06.823
I don't think I'm gonna be able
to make it for Christmas.

01:11:06.996 --> 01:11:10.864
But tell Dad I said hi,
and I'll talk to you soon.

01:11:11.066 --> 01:11:12.328
Okay? Bye-bye.

01:11:22.811 --> 01:11:24.176
Frankie.

01:11:26.382 --> 01:11:27.849
Another one.

01:11:31.253 --> 01:11:36.020
I can't serve you no more,
Mr. Chapman. It ain't good for you.

01:11:36.191 --> 01:11:39.183
Please, Frankie. Please.

01:11:39.361 --> 01:11:43.092
Just one more. Just a taste.
For old times' sake.

01:11:43.265 --> 01:11:47.065
-I can't, Mr. C.
-You could when I was on top.

01:11:49.238 --> 01:11:52.207
I used to come in
with a broad on each arm...

01:11:52.374 --> 01:11:55.241
...and a bankroll that could
choke a hippo.

01:11:56.812 --> 01:11:59.246
You were my friend then.

01:12:00.616 --> 01:12:03.483
Everyone was my friend then.

01:12:04.787 --> 01:12:08.245
Whatever happened to that nice girl,
the blond?

01:12:08.424 --> 01:12:11.825
She was a nice girl. Real classy.

01:12:15.664 --> 01:12:18.064
I broke her heart, Frankie.

01:12:19.768 --> 01:12:22.601
I broke it into a million pieces.

01:12:26.075 --> 01:12:28.236
Here you go, Mr. C.

01:12:29.712 --> 01:12:31.612
-Thanks.
-Oh, God.

01:12:34.783 --> 01:12:36.273
Oh, God.

01:12:41.156 --> 01:12:43.249
Dear Father in heaven....

01:12:44.226 --> 01:12:45.693
That's better.

01:12:46.295 --> 01:12:51.961
I'm not a praying man, but if you're
up there, and you can hear me...

01:12:53.902 --> 01:12:55.335
...show me the way.

01:13:04.580 --> 01:13:06.571
-Hi.
-Hi.

01:13:07.416 --> 01:13:09.111
Sign right there.

01:13:11.086 --> 01:13:12.383
Thank you.

01:13:14.223 --> 01:13:16.817
-ls Susan Rawlings around?
-Your name?

01:13:16.992 --> 01:13:18.619
Nick Chapman.

01:13:23.532 --> 01:13:27.195
-Tell Ms. Rawlings there's a Mr...
-Chapman.

01:13:27.369 --> 01:13:29.894
...to see her. Thanks.

01:13:31.106 --> 01:13:34.303
-Her office is at the end of the hall.
-Thanks.

01:13:50.492 --> 01:13:54.326
My, my, look what the cat dragged in.

01:13:55.063 --> 01:13:56.496
Hello, Nick.

01:13:57.399 --> 01:14:02.496
I almost didn't recognize you without
that starlet sitting on your face.

01:14:04.173 --> 01:14:07.939
Careful, you're tracking in failure
all over my carpet.

01:14:13.449 --> 01:14:14.916
-Hi.
-Hi.

01:14:16.885 --> 01:14:18.648
-Come in.
-Thanks.

01:14:19.922 --> 01:14:23.949
-Nice office.
-I share it with a couple of people.

01:14:24.993 --> 01:14:28.394
Yeah, I finally got some windows.

01:14:29.832 --> 01:14:32.801
They don't open.
That's my next promotion.

01:14:36.605 --> 01:14:37.867
Sit down.

01:14:38.040 --> 01:14:39.337
Thanks.

01:14:43.879 --> 01:14:47.645
-So how have you been?
-Well, I'm a messenger this week.

01:14:47.816 --> 01:14:51.946
I was making a delivery,
so I thought I'd see how you're doing.

01:14:52.120 --> 01:14:54.645
-So how you doing?
-Good.

01:14:54.823 --> 01:14:56.984
Yeah. Things are going well.

01:14:59.528 --> 01:15:01.723
Have you seen Emmet and Jenny?

01:15:01.897 --> 01:15:04.923
Yeah, yeah. I saw them last night.

01:15:05.100 --> 01:15:09.503
Lucy, oh, she's so cute.
She looks like Emmet.

01:15:11.340 --> 01:15:13.171
Without the beard.

01:15:16.912 --> 01:15:18.937
You should give him a call.

01:15:21.383 --> 01:15:25.376
Well, I wouldn't....
Wouldn't know what to say.

01:15:25.554 --> 01:15:28.387
Well, I think he'd like
to hear from you.

01:15:28.857 --> 01:15:30.154
Yeah.

01:15:33.762 --> 01:15:35.730
So are you seeing anyone?

01:15:35.898 --> 01:15:38.366
-No.
-No?

01:15:39.468 --> 01:15:41.800
-You?
-No.

01:15:46.775 --> 01:15:48.333
You look great.

01:15:49.344 --> 01:15:51.005
I do?

01:15:51.179 --> 01:15:53.340
-Really?
-Yes.

01:15:53.515 --> 01:15:56.313
-So do you.
-Thanks.

01:15:57.686 --> 01:15:59.449
I should probably...

01:16:01.123 --> 01:16:02.647
...hit the road.

01:16:05.661 --> 01:16:09.153
You wanna see a movie
or something sometime?

01:16:11.700 --> 01:16:14.669
Well, don't--
You can think about it.

01:16:14.870 --> 01:16:17.668
You should think about it. I don't....

01:16:19.875 --> 01:16:22.571
I don't think I'm ready yet.

01:16:25.213 --> 01:16:30.583
Well, I understand. That's only--
That's, you know...yeah.

01:16:36.992 --> 01:16:38.482
Okay, well....

01:16:39.895 --> 01:16:42.887
It was...it was great to see you.

01:16:43.599 --> 01:16:45.999
It was great to see you too.

01:16:49.638 --> 01:16:51.902
I better get that.

01:16:53.976 --> 01:16:57.343
Maybe we can....

01:16:58.213 --> 01:16:59.703
Yeah.

01:17:04.252 --> 01:17:05.742
Okay.

01:17:35.951 --> 01:17:38.681
-Nick! You dick!
-Lydia!

01:17:39.254 --> 01:17:40.585
Hi.

01:17:40.756 --> 01:17:42.917
Hey, how come you didn't call me?

01:17:43.091 --> 01:17:45.116
Sorry. I'm a dick.

01:17:46.228 --> 01:17:47.661
So how have you been?

01:17:47.829 --> 01:17:50.889
How've I been? Ah, how've I been?

01:17:51.099 --> 01:17:55.559
It started nine months ago.
A man was graduating from film school.

01:17:56.972 --> 01:17:58.667
So that's how I've been.

01:17:58.840 --> 01:18:02.970
Oh, Nick, that's the saddest story
I ever heard.

01:18:03.145 --> 01:18:06.603
-You should feel sorry for yourself.
-Oh, I do. I do.

01:18:09.217 --> 01:18:12.311
So, what moral may we extract
from all of this?

01:18:12.487 --> 01:18:15.820
Gee, Miss Crabtree,
if I ever get another chance...

01:18:15.991 --> 01:18:18.983
...maybe I'll do things
a little differently.

01:18:19.161 --> 01:18:22.927
-Maybe I won't be such an asshole.
-Think that's possible?

01:18:23.098 --> 01:18:24.588
Thank you.

01:18:25.300 --> 01:18:27.029
-You're welcome.
-Nice.

01:18:27.202 --> 01:18:28.533
Yes.

01:18:33.742 --> 01:18:35.141
Wow.

01:18:36.144 --> 01:18:38.510
This is gigantic.

01:18:39.281 --> 01:18:41.340
Do you live here alone?

01:18:41.516 --> 01:18:44.212
As far as I know.

01:18:44.386 --> 01:18:46.547
-Want something to drink?
-A beer?

01:18:47.122 --> 01:18:48.589
Yes.

01:18:52.661 --> 01:18:56.461
-How long have you had the place?
-I got it after school.

01:18:57.099 --> 01:19:00.694
It used to be
an old mannequin factory.

01:19:01.870 --> 01:19:05.636
-I fixed it up. A lot.
-Good job.

01:19:09.678 --> 01:19:10.975
Boy, Nick....

01:19:11.446 --> 01:19:14.506
Hasn't your agent been able
to do anything?

01:19:14.683 --> 01:19:17.982
Oh, sure. He squeezed my balls
until I was dead.

01:19:20.489 --> 01:19:21.956
Thanks.

01:19:26.728 --> 01:19:27.888
So you working?

01:19:29.431 --> 01:19:32.662
Yes. I have a night job.

01:19:32.834 --> 01:19:37.703
I round up shopping carts that are
left out on the sidewalks, you know?

01:19:37.873 --> 01:19:41.206
I was thinking about
doing a documentary about it.

01:19:41.376 --> 01:19:45.278
The people that leave them there.
Why do they leave them?

01:19:45.447 --> 01:19:48.678
Are they making a statement
about the supermarket?

01:19:48.850 --> 01:19:51.910
Or about...society?

01:19:52.087 --> 01:19:55.545
You know, I interviewed
a couple of them.

01:19:55.724 --> 01:19:58.591
And the whole thing became so...

01:19:58.760 --> 01:20:04.699
...fucking boring that I gave up.

01:20:06.134 --> 01:20:09.194
But, you know, I'm not depressed
that I'm 26...

01:20:09.371 --> 01:20:12.898
...and have no idea
what I'm gonna do with my life.

01:20:21.183 --> 01:20:24.118
-Great! You wanna meet my neighbors?
-Yeah.

01:20:24.286 --> 01:20:25.844
Well, let's go.

01:20:32.060 --> 01:20:36.463
We're going to meet my neighbors
We're going to meet my neighbors

01:20:36.631 --> 01:20:39.657
-Come, come, come.
-I'm coming.

01:20:47.976 --> 01:20:51.605
They wanna make a video.
Maybe you guys should talk.

01:20:52.414 --> 01:20:54.609
-Why don't you direct it?
-No....

01:20:54.816 --> 01:20:59.651
I gave up video. I'm into ham radio
performance art now.

01:21:05.894 --> 01:21:08.260
-Have they got any money?
-No.

01:21:08.463 --> 01:21:11.023
I'll do it. What are they called?

01:21:11.199 --> 01:21:14.134
They don't have a name.
They need a name...

01:21:14.302 --> 01:21:17.294
...and they need a concept.

01:23:50.492 --> 01:23:54.326
That was Pez People
doing "The Whites of Their Eyes"...

01:23:54.529 --> 01:23:59.023
...directed by Nick Chapman.
Next, a group called Bide-a-wee.

01:23:59.200 --> 01:24:02.636
They're from Rhode Island,
that little tiny state.

01:24:02.804 --> 01:24:04.271
Rhode Island? No? Okay.

01:24:41.509 --> 01:24:42.942
Hi, Em.

01:24:46.047 --> 01:24:47.412
Well, hello.

01:24:53.188 --> 01:24:55.850
Hey, Lucy. Hi, Lucy.

01:24:59.994 --> 01:25:01.689
Look what I got.

01:25:01.863 --> 01:25:04.661
Hello there! Hello there!

01:25:04.833 --> 01:25:06.391
Okay, okay. Here.

01:25:07.402 --> 01:25:09.495
What's that, what's that?

01:25:12.807 --> 01:25:14.434
She's beautiful.

01:25:16.244 --> 01:25:18.337
You ought to get one.

01:25:18.513 --> 01:25:20.071
Oh, yeah.

01:25:20.248 --> 01:25:24.582
The timing is perfect.
No girlfriend, no job, no future.

01:25:27.122 --> 01:25:29.352
Would you hand me that rag there?

01:25:35.730 --> 01:25:37.755
I didn't fight for you.

01:25:41.069 --> 01:25:42.627
Yeah, I know.

01:25:47.709 --> 01:25:50.303
I want you to be my friend again.

01:25:51.813 --> 01:25:57.308
-Nick, I was always your friend.
-No, I know. I mean....

01:26:00.755 --> 01:26:03.451
I wanna be your friend again.

01:26:15.904 --> 01:26:18.202
I'll check it for you.

01:26:19.007 --> 01:26:21.567
Oh, yeah, here it is right here.

01:26:24.746 --> 01:26:27.442
Hi. How was your trip?

01:26:27.615 --> 01:26:30.106
Shit. It snowed.

01:26:30.285 --> 01:26:32.185
Here's your mail.

01:26:32.654 --> 01:26:34.645
-Anything certified?
-No.

01:26:34.822 --> 01:26:39.418
-How was your weekend?
-Went to Santa Barbara. Read scripts.

01:26:39.661 --> 01:26:42.494
I saw an interesting music video
last night.

01:26:42.664 --> 01:26:45.326
It was directed by Nick Chapman.

01:26:46.601 --> 01:26:49.263
Really? Was it any good?

01:26:49.437 --> 01:26:54.340
It had a quality. It was interesting.
I mean, for a video.

01:26:54.709 --> 01:26:56.006
What group was it?

01:26:57.412 --> 01:26:58.777
I don't know.

01:27:00.148 --> 01:27:03.879
-You don't know?
-I don't remember. I can find out.

01:27:04.052 --> 01:27:07.715
Do you want me to try and get you
a copy of the tape?

01:27:09.123 --> 01:27:12.183
No. See if you can get him
on the phone.

01:27:17.265 --> 01:27:22.532
-You sure I can't help with anything?
-No, no. Everything's out of control.

01:27:28.610 --> 01:27:32.569
-What time do you have to be back?
-Don't worry about it.

01:27:36.217 --> 01:27:38.208
When did you start cooking?

01:27:40.121 --> 01:27:42.954
Well, I can't afford to eat
out anymore.

01:27:43.124 --> 01:27:48.926
And then I heard a rumor that you
could buy food in a store, uncooked...

01:27:49.097 --> 01:27:51.657
...take it home and cook it yourself.

01:27:51.833 --> 01:27:56.031
-I think I saw an article about that.
-Oh, you saw that?

01:27:57.138 --> 01:27:59.698
So have you seen the Pez People video?

01:28:00.942 --> 01:28:04.537
-I guess I keep missing it.
-It's only been on once.

01:28:04.712 --> 01:28:08.705
But Lydia has a copy of it
if you wanna borrow the cassette.

01:28:09.117 --> 01:28:10.607
Oh.

01:28:12.553 --> 01:28:13.611
Hello?

01:28:14.055 --> 01:28:15.955
-ls this Nick Chapman?
-Yeah.

01:28:16.124 --> 01:28:18.957
This is Todd Marvin
calling for Allen Habel.

01:28:19.227 --> 01:28:21.127
Yeah.

01:28:21.296 --> 01:28:22.786
Hi, Todd.

01:28:23.631 --> 01:28:26.566
Listen, could l--?
Can I call you back?

01:28:26.734 --> 01:28:30.636
Because I'm-- I'm kind of
in the middle of something.

01:28:31.306 --> 01:28:33.399
-Sure.
-Thanks. Bye.

01:28:33.574 --> 01:28:35.098
Bye.

01:28:36.778 --> 01:28:38.143
What did he say?

01:28:38.313 --> 01:28:41.840
He said he was
in the middle of something.

01:28:43.084 --> 01:28:45.314
Was he talking on another line?

01:28:46.054 --> 01:28:47.419
I don't know.

01:28:50.625 --> 01:28:54.322
I wonder if he's already made a deal
with somebody else.

01:28:55.663 --> 01:28:57.221
I could find out.

01:28:58.733 --> 01:29:05.002
Make some calls. See if you
can find out who he's talking with.

01:29:06.641 --> 01:29:08.108
Sandwich okay?

01:29:09.977 --> 01:29:12.070
Do you want any more of that?

01:29:13.014 --> 01:29:14.879
-No, thanks.
-All right.

01:29:15.049 --> 01:29:16.448
See....

01:29:16.617 --> 01:29:20.212
My secret is that I take the plastic
off each slice...

01:29:20.388 --> 01:29:23.448
...before I put them
into the toaster oven.

01:29:24.092 --> 01:29:27.425
I mean, that's where you get
that kind of...

01:29:28.529 --> 01:29:31.293
...special taste.

01:29:32.266 --> 01:29:33.528
Okay.

01:29:33.768 --> 01:29:35.827
You want some more soup?

01:29:36.237 --> 01:29:38.364
You sure? There's a ton here.

01:29:42.076 --> 01:29:45.102
What time did you say
you have to be back?

01:29:45.413 --> 01:29:46.937
Don't worry about it.

01:29:49.350 --> 01:29:51.477
You wanna take a drive?

01:29:51.753 --> 01:29:53.015
Sure.

01:29:53.688 --> 01:29:55.417
Where to?

01:29:56.758 --> 01:29:58.248
France?

01:30:08.736 --> 01:30:11.398
Nick, how's it going?
This is Todd again.

01:30:11.572 --> 01:30:16.703
Allen needs to talk with you as soon
as possible, so please get back to us.

01:30:27.288 --> 01:30:31.190
I discovered him, and now I can't
even get him on the phone.

01:30:31.359 --> 01:30:33.850
-That's typical.
-What's his name?

01:30:34.429 --> 01:30:37.125
-Nick Chapman.
-I never even heard of him.

01:30:37.298 --> 01:30:39.357
I hear he's a genius.

01:30:41.569 --> 01:30:45.733
So I recommended Dick Chapman,
but I hear he's unavailable.

01:30:45.907 --> 01:30:49.138
-lsn't that Nick Chapman?
-I thought it was Dick.

01:30:49.310 --> 01:30:54.338
-You should see his new video.
-It's the best. And I've seen them all.

01:31:02.323 --> 01:31:04.689
Nick, hi, it's your agent, Neil.

01:31:04.859 --> 01:31:11.094
There's an enormous amount of activity
happening, so I need to talk to you.

01:31:11.265 --> 01:31:13.028
Like, immediately.

01:31:13.201 --> 01:31:18.434
So please return this call the second
you get in, okay? Thank you.

01:31:37.358 --> 01:31:39.918
Nick, Todd again. Third message.

01:31:40.094 --> 01:31:44.326
You can reach me
at any of the numbers I've left. Bye.

01:31:44.499 --> 01:31:48.765
Nick, this is your agent, Neil.
Please give me a call.

01:32:03.117 --> 01:32:05.608
Yes, I can tell you what Nick wants.

01:32:05.786 --> 01:32:09.347
I happen to speak to him
three times a day.

01:32:09.524 --> 01:32:15.190
Why am I yelling, Stan? Because nobody
calls me a douche bag. Okay?

01:32:15.363 --> 01:32:19.356
Okay, forgiven. But I'd only hope
you remember, young man...

01:32:19.534 --> 01:32:23.129
...you're not the only one
who wants to deal with Nick.

01:32:23.304 --> 01:32:26.637
The kid happens to be a genius.
So just sit back...

01:32:26.807 --> 01:32:29.571
...relax your crack
and I'll be in touch.

01:32:29.744 --> 01:32:33.612
Douche bag.
Corky, try Nick again!

01:32:40.922 --> 01:32:45.291
Get me a reservation on the 1 2:00
flight to New York, Friday.

01:32:46.394 --> 01:32:51.832
Call Rod at home and tell him not to
use the shower until the plumber comes.

01:32:52.700 --> 01:32:55.794
Call Nick Chapman regarding Beach Nuts.

01:32:55.970 --> 01:32:58.438
And get me a pot of decaf.

01:32:58.940 --> 01:33:00.965
I think we may be too late.

01:33:01.142 --> 01:33:05.841
From what I hear, he's probably
booked for the next two years.

01:33:06.013 --> 01:33:09.312
People are calling me,
asking how to reach him.

01:33:09.517 --> 01:33:10.814
It's incredible.

01:33:11.552 --> 01:33:14.214
I wanna talk to him.

01:33:20.094 --> 01:33:21.994
Nick? Allen Habel.

01:33:22.163 --> 01:33:27.191
I've instructed my secretary to give
you my home number. Call me tonight.

01:33:27.902 --> 01:33:32.669
Nick, this is Lori. Would you please
call me as soon as you get this?

01:33:32.840 --> 01:33:35.832
Hi, Nick, it's Gretchen.
I've missed you.

01:33:36.010 --> 01:33:40.413
Where are you? Call me, okay? Bye.

01:33:41.248 --> 01:33:47.414
Nick, don't even ask me how.
The important thing is, I did it.

01:33:49.357 --> 01:33:55.660
I have here five movie scripts, three
TV pilots, a miniseries and an opera.

01:33:55.830 --> 01:33:57.593
Now, we can take our pick.

01:33:57.798 --> 01:34:01.529
I've read almost all of them
almost all the way through.

01:34:01.702 --> 01:34:05.968
I think the best one is the show
about the black kid and the cop.

01:34:06.140 --> 01:34:10.702
It is very heartwarming and funny,
and yet it has an edge.

01:34:10.945 --> 01:34:14.403
-Which is very intriguing.
-I'd like to do my script.

01:34:20.321 --> 01:34:25.349
Well, Nick, I have to go
on record and say...

01:34:25.526 --> 01:34:28.893
...that I think that you
are making a huge mistake.

01:34:31.332 --> 01:34:33.527
Well, I want to do my script.

01:34:43.711 --> 01:34:46.680
Nick, do you hate me?

01:34:47.248 --> 01:34:49.182
Why do you hurt me like this?

01:34:50.584 --> 01:34:55.920
I have something perfect for you,
and you slap me with a dead fish.

01:34:56.857 --> 01:34:59.417
I'm going to make my movie, Neil.

01:35:06.534 --> 01:35:09.094
I'm sorry...

01:35:11.072 --> 01:35:14.098
...but you're making a huge mistake.

01:35:14.408 --> 01:35:18.504
Yeah, well, at least
it'll be my mistake.

01:35:22.817 --> 01:35:24.375
Okay.

01:35:25.553 --> 01:35:28.021
Refresh my memory.

01:35:30.691 --> 01:35:35.025
The whole thing takes place
at a country house...

01:35:35.196 --> 01:35:37.460
...in the middle of winter.

01:36:05.292 --> 01:36:07.954
No, no. That's fine.

01:36:13.100 --> 01:36:15.227
-Snow good for you?
-Let's do it.

01:36:15.402 --> 01:36:17.097
-All right.
-Roll sound.

01:36:17.271 --> 01:36:18.863
Speed.

01:36:19.039 --> 01:36:20.870
-Quiet.
-And...

01:36:21.041 --> 01:36:22.633
...action!

01:36:28.115 --> 01:36:30.345
-Crane!
-Crane.

01:36:35.356 --> 01:36:37.916
Action in the house.

01:36:42.263 --> 01:36:45.357
Happy New Year!
