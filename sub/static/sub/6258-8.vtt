WEBVTT

00:10.120 --> 00:12.168
Is that lavender?

00:16.960 --> 00:19.167
You ready to dance?

00:19.320 --> 00:21.641
I'm ready for more than that.

00:24.320 --> 00:26.288
We should get handcuffed together
more often.

00:26.440 --> 00:28.204
You wouldn't even know
what to do with me.

00:28.360 --> 00:29.885
Pablo: Ash!

00:30.040 --> 00:32.168
We made a little something for ya.

00:33.160 --> 00:34.446
His real hand.

00:34.600 --> 00:36.011
What the hell
is this doing here?

00:36.160 --> 00:37.491
You'll have to bury it deep

00:37.680 --> 00:39.170
below the place
where yourjourney began.

00:39.320 --> 00:41.163
Let's go back there
and end it all.

00:41.320 --> 00:43.084
No. You go there,
you'd end up possessed,

00:43.240 --> 00:44.969
and I would have
to cut your heads off,

00:45.120 --> 00:46.451
and that would just
be bad for everyone.

00:46.600 --> 00:49.206
Where's this big bad cabin
at anyway, Ash?

00:50.200 --> 00:52.771
Ash? Where'd he go?

01:17.320 --> 01:20.051
Sorry, Tweety.

01:21.240 --> 01:23.607
Nothin' survives around here.

01:23.760 --> 01:24.966
( Tweets, squawks )

01:25.120 --> 01:26.360
Oh! Oh!

01:26.560 --> 01:29.006
Geez.

02:01.240 --> 02:03.641
Honey, I'm home.

02:04.720 --> 02:07.291
( Music playing )

02:25.920 --> 02:29.288
Linda's voice:
Oh, Ash. Beautiful.

02:29.440 --> 02:33.445
I really love it.
I'll never take it off.

02:35.360 --> 02:36.725
( Banging )

02:59.040 --> 03:00.326
( squeaks )

03:00.480 --> 03:02.801
( banging SfOPS )

03:06.160 --> 03:08.288
( sighs )

03:08.440 --> 03:10.090
( branch snaps )

03:21.320 --> 03:23.527
Oh, Jesus.
I almost blew your head off.

03:23.720 --> 03:25.722
A little on edge, are we?

03:27.600 --> 03:30.729
- Where's Pablo and Kelly?
- We split up to look for you.

03:31.880 --> 03:33.848
Good. It's safer away from here.

03:34.000 --> 03:36.401
Why would you
just run out like that?

03:36.560 --> 03:38.005
I'm not big on good-byes.

03:38.160 --> 03:40.527
Ash, you shouldn't do this alone.

03:40.680 --> 03:41.966
I have to do it alone.

03:42.120 --> 03:44.202
Don't you get it?
Everybody dies here.

03:44.360 --> 03:46.886
It's just a rule--
death, taxes, more death.

03:47.080 --> 03:49.526
And I don't pay taxes,
so all I know is death.

03:49.680 --> 03:52.047
Fuck the rules.

03:52.200 --> 03:54.202
I'm gonna help you end this.

03:55.920 --> 03:58.207
Lady, I like your style.

04:13.760 --> 04:14.841
Wow.

04:15.000 --> 04:18.721
Last time I was here with a girl,
I was hoping to get laid.

04:18.880 --> 04:20.564
Didn't quite work out that way.

04:20.720 --> 04:23.644
I did cut my own hand off
with a chainsaw, though.

04:23.800 --> 04:25.006
It was a fun weekend.

04:25.200 --> 04:28.170
Trust me, you'd have
never gotten laid here.

04:28.320 --> 04:30.322
It was a little cozier back then.

04:42.600 --> 04:43.965
Ash: Bad memory?

04:45.600 --> 04:47.648
That's what this cabin does.

04:47.800 --> 04:49.928
She's a cruel, cruel bitch.

04:50.920 --> 04:53.287
Good.

04:53.440 --> 04:54.771
So am I.

04:54.920 --> 04:57.207
Then let's get to work.

05:06.080 --> 05:09.448
Carson:
Please, man, I need you.

05:09.600 --> 05:10.886
It's dark.

05:11.920 --> 05:13.285
So during my little trip,

05:13.440 --> 05:16.489
I had a vision about
the book being buried here.

05:16.640 --> 05:18.483
This is where it all started.

05:18.640 --> 05:21.007
And that's where it's gonna end.

05:25.320 --> 05:28.130
- What's down there?
- Bad things.

05:28.280 --> 05:31.841
- Doesn't look so bad.
- Uh, I wouldn't get too close.

05:39.640 --> 05:41.563
Need a crowbar or something.

05:41.720 --> 05:43.927
Uh, there's probably one
out in the work shed.

05:44.080 --> 05:45.650
- Let's go get it.
- Yeah, um...

05:45.800 --> 05:48.280
- What?
- Just a teeny warning--

05:48.440 --> 05:50.920
there's something out there
that you probably shouldn't see.

05:51.120 --> 05:52.804
Worse than everything else
I didn't want to see?

05:52.960 --> 05:54.200
My ex-girlfriend.

05:54.360 --> 05:56.169
Wait. Your ex-girlfriend
is in the work shed?

05:56.320 --> 05:58.641
Part of her.
It's complicated.

05:58.800 --> 05:59.847
Maybe I shouldn't go there.

06:00.040 --> 06:01.326
Well, if you don't
wanna talk about it.

06:01.480 --> 06:04.086
She got possessed.
I cut her head off with a shovel,

06:04.240 --> 06:06.481
then she did this crazy dance
in the moonlight.

06:06.640 --> 06:10.281
I put her head in a vise,
and I cut it with a chainsaw.

06:10.440 --> 06:13.410
She did have
a rockin' bod, though.

06:13.600 --> 06:16.843
I'll stay here...
just watch that book.

06:17.000 --> 06:18.843
Smart call.

06:31.000 --> 06:32.729
( Creaking )

06:32.880 --> 06:34.211
Oh!

06:34.360 --> 06:38.046
(wind whistling )

06:51.680 --> 06:54.047
( squeaking )

07:16.880 --> 07:19.201
( crickets chirping )

07:22.360 --> 07:24.931
( wolf howling )

07:26.040 --> 07:27.201
I'm telling you,
if you gotta pee,

07:27.360 --> 07:29.567
you should just pop a squat,
'cause we're lost.

07:29.760 --> 07:31.762
All right.
Thanks, Boy Scout.

07:37.080 --> 07:39.048
Oh, we're going in a circle.

07:39.200 --> 07:41.965
What, you're
a professional woodsman now?

07:42.120 --> 07:44.600
No. Look.

07:44.760 --> 07:46.888
We're back at the car.

07:47.040 --> 07:48.929
That's a good way to tell.

07:49.080 --> 07:50.366
Brad:
What are we doing here?

07:50.520 --> 07:52.409
Brad, I think Heather's
just getting tired.

07:52.560 --> 07:54.289
Hey. We should ask them
where we're headed.

07:54.440 --> 07:56.522
- Should be another cabin back there.
- We're totally lost.

07:56.680 --> 07:59.331
Hey! Hello?

08:00.360 --> 08:01.441
You have no idea
where we are.

08:01.600 --> 08:02.681
<i>He'! '</i>

08:02.840 --> 08:04.126
- Well, hey there.
- Hello.

08:04.280 --> 08:05.486
Beautiful night, huh?

08:07.440 --> 08:09.124
Brad.

08:09.280 --> 08:10.805
Mate, mate,
we don't want any trouble.

08:10.960 --> 08:12.928
If you're gonna rob us,
we have no money.

08:13.080 --> 08:15.321
- I have pepper spray.
- I will shoot.

08:15.480 --> 08:17.130
Is that a flare gun?

08:18.120 --> 08:20.851
Oh! Uh-- uh--
no, no, no.

08:21.000 --> 08:22.968
Uh, it's all right.
Um, we're the good guys.

08:23.120 --> 08:25.487
These guns, they're for evil.

08:25.640 --> 08:27.290
Bears.
Evil bears.

08:27.480 --> 08:29.323
There's evil bears
in these woods.

08:30.320 --> 08:31.651
We're actually
really friendly people.

08:31.800 --> 08:33.609
We are so friendly.

08:34.720 --> 08:36.722
Well, can't be too careful, huh?

08:36.880 --> 08:38.370
Bears are a menace.

08:38.520 --> 08:41.490
Listen, we're actually really lost,
and we're looking for this cabin.

08:41.640 --> 08:43.722
Oh. Um, we passed one
a while back.

08:43.880 --> 08:48.044
I wanted to crash there.
But, uh, Brad here wanted to push on.

08:48.200 --> 08:50.009
Rest is the reward,
not the goal.

08:50.160 --> 08:52.811
Please, take me with you.

08:52.960 --> 08:54.530
It was just a couple miles
northeast.

08:54.720 --> 08:56.324
Do you know what,
could you just show us

08:56.480 --> 08:58.687
'cause we're
directionally challenged.

08:58.840 --> 09:01.446
- Um...
- Yeah.

09:01.640 --> 09:04.928
Yeah? Yeah.
Yeah, we can show you.

09:05.080 --> 09:07.970
( Sputtering )

09:14.840 --> 09:17.047
( electricity humming )

09:19.520 --> 09:21.170
Linda:
Who's that?

09:21.320 --> 09:22.810
Please don't hurt me.

09:22.960 --> 09:26.851
You swore. You swore
that we'd always be together.

09:27.040 --> 09:28.849
I love you.

10:11.640 --> 10:13.244
Long time no see, Linda.

10:15.160 --> 10:18.164
Don't get up.
Just lookin' for a crowbar.

10:21.760 --> 10:23.762
Oh, no, you don't.

10:25.800 --> 10:27.211
Oh, come on.

10:29.600 --> 10:30.761
Fisher?

10:32.080 --> 10:33.923
- ( Banging on door)
- Amanda?

10:35.400 --> 10:37.164
( Clock bell rings )

10:44.120 --> 10:46.248
( distant scream )

10:55.120 --> 10:58.124
( distorted sound )

11:04.960 --> 11:08.442
( distorted words )

11:20.320 --> 11:22.004
It's hard to see
through the trees and the fog,

11:22.200 --> 11:23.770
but up there's the Big Dipper.

11:23.920 --> 11:24.967
Melissa:
He proposed to me

11:25.160 --> 11:26.525
by the light of the North Star.

11:26.680 --> 11:28.967
That's real romantic.

11:29.160 --> 11:30.969
So are you two together, or...?

11:31.120 --> 11:33.487
Who, me and Pablo? No.

11:33.640 --> 11:36.689
Huh. I haven't seen a guy
since we started this dumb hike.

11:36.880 --> 11:38.564
It might be nice to have
someone to keep me warm

11:38.720 --> 11:40.484
for a night or two.

11:40.640 --> 11:42.324
He's got a girlfriend, though.

11:42.480 --> 11:45.484
Oh, of course he does.
Well, maybe I'll find a cute bear.

11:45.680 --> 11:48.160
Yeah. Doubt that.

11:51.840 --> 11:53.888
So you go about a half mile
down that track,

11:54.040 --> 11:56.361
the cabin's right there.
Can't miss it.

11:56.520 --> 11:58.841
Good looking out, man.
Thanks.

11:59.000 --> 12:00.843
Hey. You know, you guys
shouldn't be wandering

12:01.000 --> 12:02.490
around these woods
alone at night.

12:02.640 --> 12:04.688
Oh, we're fine.
We're at one with nature.

12:04.840 --> 12:09.209
Well, I mean, we could stay
one night, you know. Maybe.

12:09.360 --> 12:11.328
( Chuckles )
Thanks, man. But we're all good.

12:11.480 --> 12:13.369
- Nice meeting you guys.
- Thank you.

12:13.520 --> 12:14.646
- Take care.
- Bye.

12:14.800 --> 12:16.689
Can we please stay
in a hotel tomorrow?

12:16.880 --> 12:18.166
I hate it out here.

12:18.320 --> 12:21.290
Man, I really hope
that they don't end up dead.

12:21.440 --> 12:23.204
They have pepper spray.

12:25.440 --> 12:28.489
( Banging )
Amanda!

12:29.600 --> 12:30.886
Amanda!

12:32.120 --> 12:33.326
Linda:
Ash.

12:36.680 --> 12:40.048
No.
We are not talking.

12:41.200 --> 12:43.282
But I'm better now.

12:43.440 --> 12:47.081
Ash, honey,
why won't you look at me?

12:49.920 --> 12:52.730
You left me here, Ash.

12:52.880 --> 12:54.609
That's because
you were dead.

12:54.760 --> 12:56.285
You killed me.

12:57.520 --> 12:59.249
You turned into a monster.

12:59.400 --> 13:02.165
I loved you.
You loved me, too.

13:02.320 --> 13:03.924
We had a life planned.

13:04.080 --> 13:05.923
I've been so lonely.

13:06.080 --> 13:09.766
No. You are not alive.
I know you're not.

13:09.920 --> 13:11.922
Don't you love me anymore?

13:12.080 --> 13:13.923
You're not Linda,
you're just a head!

13:14.080 --> 13:16.208
Why are you being so mean?

13:17.560 --> 13:19.927
It's because of that woman,
that cop.

13:20.080 --> 13:22.321
You like her, don't you?

13:22.480 --> 13:24.448
What about us?

13:24.600 --> 13:27.649
You promised you'd take me
to Jacksonville after this.

13:27.800 --> 13:30.280
That house on the beach,
that was for us.

13:30.440 --> 13:31.965
Shut up!

13:32.160 --> 13:34.049
She's gonna die here.

13:34.200 --> 13:38.125
We all die.
Everyone you ever loved.

13:40.600 --> 13:42.284
( Bell rings )

14:39.720 --> 14:43.167
- ( discordant notes playing )
- ( squeaking )

14:43.360 --> 14:45.408
( sighs )

15:06.920 --> 15:08.763
Dr. Knowby's voice:
The Kandarian dagger's handle

15:08.920 --> 15:11.366
is carved of human bone.

15:11.520 --> 15:16.162
The blade itself seems to have
other-worldly powers.

15:16.320 --> 15:19.130
But when it's placed upon
the Necronomicon,

15:19.280 --> 15:21.726
it sears the binding's flesh.

15:21.880 --> 15:24.884
Oh! Jesus, Ash.

15:25.040 --> 15:26.371
You scared me.

15:26.520 --> 15:28.010
Is everything okay?

15:28.160 --> 15:30.970
Amanda, you know,
I've been thinking...

15:31.120 --> 15:33.691
I think we should
just get outta here.

15:33.840 --> 15:35.410
I thought you wanted
to end this.

15:35.560 --> 15:37.722
It's easier to just run.
I've done it before.

15:37.880 --> 15:40.247
You just leave all this shit behind
and start over.

15:40.400 --> 15:43.131
I mean, my God, Amanda,
haven't you had enough?

15:43.280 --> 15:45.726
Of course.
I'm living a nightmare.

15:45.920 --> 15:49.163
But you--
don't you have a responsibility?

15:49.320 --> 15:53.166
Why me?
Why do I deserve all this?

15:53.320 --> 15:54.890
You know I'm right.

15:57.600 --> 16:02.811
Why don't we, you and me,
just get the hell outta here

16:02.960 --> 16:05.566
and go somewhere
we can start all over?

16:06.680 --> 16:07.886
You and me?

16:08.040 --> 16:10.088
Is that such a horrible idea?

16:10.280 --> 16:13.284
( Chuckling )
Look...

16:13.440 --> 16:15.886
I like you, Ash, I do.

16:16.040 --> 16:20.489
Never thought I'd say that to a crazed,
chainsaw-handed Deadite killer--

16:20.640 --> 16:23.086
the best I could ever know, but--

16:23.240 --> 16:26.767
I know, I know that I'm not
anybody's idea of a great catch.

16:26.960 --> 16:28.689
- Well, I wasn't saying that--
- No, let me finish.

16:28.880 --> 16:31.770
I'm-- I'm trying to be honest here,
and it's hard.

16:31.920 --> 16:34.287
I'm not anybody's idea
of a great catch-- I got that.

16:34.440 --> 16:37.887
I mean, look at my life-- I work
in a trailer-trash discount store.

16:38.040 --> 16:40.771
I've got a book
that summons evil spirits,

16:40.920 --> 16:43.764
but, you know,
before all of that happened,

16:43.920 --> 16:46.605
I had a future,
and it didn't involve chainsaws

16:46.760 --> 16:48.410
and shotguns and demons,

16:48.560 --> 16:53.248
and I just wanna-- I wanna see
if I can find that guy again.

16:53.400 --> 16:55.050
You think you could help me?

16:56.360 --> 16:58.169
I don't know...

16:59.320 --> 17:01.561
Maybe.

17:01.720 --> 17:03.529
I'd like that, Amanda.

17:03.680 --> 17:05.409
I really would.

17:06.599 --> 17:12.164
Okay, Ash, this is not
the time or the place.

17:12.319 --> 17:16.086
Amanda, life is short.
You know that.

17:21.119 --> 17:24.521
- Mm.
- Aw.

17:24.680 --> 17:26.364
I've been dreaming about that.

17:32.160 --> 17:33.400
Oh, my God!

17:33.560 --> 17:35.528
What is that?

17:36.720 --> 17:37.801
That's the whole me.

17:37.960 --> 17:39.803
What the fuck?
You just grew another hand?

17:39.960 --> 17:41.849
It's a lot more complicated
than that.

17:42.000 --> 17:43.286
It's disgusting.

17:43.440 --> 17:45.204
- What happened to it?
- What's it matter?

17:45.360 --> 17:49.410
- It looks sick.
- Beggars can't be choosers.

17:49.560 --> 17:52.370
It looks like the hand
that Ruby had.

17:53.800 --> 17:54.881
- Oh, God.
- Okay--

17:55.040 --> 17:56.371
- What happened?
- All right, all right.

17:56.520 --> 17:59.649
Maybe I grew another hand
or maybe the hand grew another me.

17:59.800 --> 18:01.723
What's the difference, Amanda?

18:01.880 --> 18:05.202
What's important is
I can give you everything you want.

18:05.360 --> 18:07.124
And I want you.

18:08.520 --> 18:09.885
Is that so bad?

18:10.040 --> 18:14.045
I mean, come on, a minute ago
you wanted me, too.

18:14.200 --> 18:16.601
Yes, before I found out
you're just some creepy tumor

18:16.760 --> 18:19.650
that grew out of the stump
of a possessed hand.

18:19.800 --> 18:22.963
Name-calling is not nice.

18:23.160 --> 18:24.810
Don't you fucking touch me.

18:24.960 --> 18:26.485
No!

18:28.280 --> 18:30.089
( Linda chuckling )

18:30.240 --> 18:32.891
Ash, you can't save her.

18:33.040 --> 18:34.963
Everyone you care about dies.

18:35.120 --> 18:36.929
- Shut up. I can get to her.
- No, you can't.

18:37.080 --> 18:39.481
You don't need her.

18:39.680 --> 18:42.047
You already have a girlfriend.
You have me.

18:43.040 --> 18:46.601
Come over here.
I'll suck you off.

18:46.760 --> 18:48.410
I give good head.

18:48.600 --> 18:50.841
You can skull-fuck me good.

18:51.000 --> 18:53.480
It's the best
you're gonna get, Ash.

18:53.640 --> 18:55.768
No woman will want you!

18:55.920 --> 18:58.651
- Stop it!
- ( motor revving )

18:59.920 --> 19:02.651
Maybe you like me better
like this.

19:19.840 --> 19:21.126
( Screams )

19:34.000 --> 19:36.446
Well, I guess
the honeymoon is over.

19:38.040 --> 19:39.929
You broke my heart.

19:40.080 --> 19:43.163
Now I'm gonna break
your fucking skull!

19:49.920 --> 19:51.763
Now you fucking sit down.

19:55.680 --> 19:57.842
What's the matter, huh?
All choked up?

19:58.000 --> 20:00.401
(laughing)

20:00.560 --> 20:02.642
Oh, you smell good.

20:02.840 --> 20:04.330
What is that?

20:04.480 --> 20:07.006
Lavender?
( laughing )

20:11.680 --> 20:13.045
No!

20:13.200 --> 20:16.568
( Screaming )

20:30.120 --> 20:31.485
Oh, thank God.

20:31.640 --> 20:35.406
Oh... it's gone.
I'm free.

20:36.440 --> 20:39.967
That hand must've
gotten into me.

20:40.120 --> 20:42.202
It made me do those horrible things
to you, Amanda.

20:42.360 --> 20:44.601
I am so sorry.

20:44.800 --> 20:47.963
(laughing)

20:48.120 --> 20:51.090
The good news is
I still have this hand

20:51.240 --> 20:53.481
to finish the job!

20:55.240 --> 20:56.685
No!

20:59.400 --> 21:01.562
Now, that's what I call cleavage.

21:08.840 --> 21:12.890
Don't worry, Amanda,
it'll all be over soon.

21:13.080 --> 21:16.084
About a minute,
give or take.

21:19.880 --> 21:22.281
Oh. Oh, careful.

21:22.440 --> 21:24.169
Watch your step.

21:25.360 --> 21:27.931
( Eerie whooshing )

21:29.400 --> 21:31.243
Oh, ho-ho-ho...

21:31.400 --> 21:33.050
what are the odds?

21:38.400 --> 21:40.209
Looks like you're
a little caught up there.

21:40.400 --> 21:41.890
If it's any consolation,

21:42.040 --> 21:45.362
that's exactly how your partner felt
when he was dying.

21:56.760 --> 21:59.650
Ah! That was a gift!

21:59.800 --> 22:02.451
You're gonna be alone forever.

22:02.600 --> 22:04.284
We'll make sure of that.

22:04.440 --> 22:06.841
You think that cop
even likes you?

22:07.000 --> 22:09.571
Do you think
you can make a life with her?

22:09.760 --> 22:11.250
You fool!

22:11.400 --> 22:13.368
She's gonna die.

22:13.560 --> 22:15.005
You already killed her.

22:15.160 --> 22:18.050
Yeah?
You always talked too much.

22:22.800 --> 22:24.928
( Choking )

22:25.920 --> 22:30.482
Amanda, we knew who you were
the first time we saw you.

22:30.640 --> 22:32.802
We knew you were gonna
try and help Ash.

22:32.960 --> 22:36.601
You won't be helping him now.
You won't be helping anyone.

22:36.760 --> 22:40.481
Fuck you!
We're gonna send you all back.

22:40.640 --> 22:43.120
( Chuckling )
BY burying the book?

22:43.280 --> 22:44.964
Good luck with that,
doll eyes.

22:45.120 --> 22:47.487
My dumb twin
can't do anything right.

22:49.160 --> 22:50.889
Oh, look at the time.

22:51.040 --> 22:53.884
I should go
and you should die.

22:56.240 --> 22:58.322
( Gasping )

23:00.520 --> 23:01.726
Amanda?

23:03.040 --> 23:04.405
Amanda?

23:06.920 --> 23:09.491
- Ash.
- Amanda.

23:09.640 --> 23:13.361
Oh, my God.
What the hell happened?

23:13.520 --> 23:17.491
<i>Your hand
grew another you.</i>

23:17.640 --> 23:19.847
What?
That's crazy.

23:21.440 --> 23:24.887
You know,
we could've been great.

23:25.040 --> 23:27.691
Oh, baby,
I'm so sorry.

23:27.880 --> 23:29.689
This is all my fault.

23:32.720 --> 23:34.722
It's better where you're going.

24:04.240 --> 24:06.481
Well, better to have
loved and lost,

24:06.640 --> 24:08.130
and, boy, did you lose.

24:08.280 --> 24:11.090
(laughing)

24:11.240 --> 24:12.401
- ( door opens )
- Pablo: Ash?

24:14.400 --> 24:15.447
Jesus.

24:15.640 --> 24:17.369
Pablo:
Did she turn into a Deadite?

24:18.360 --> 24:19.407
No.

24:19.600 --> 24:21.125
Wait. So you killed
a real person?

24:21.280 --> 24:22.691
No, I didn't do this.

24:22.840 --> 24:25.730
I did do it,
but it wasn't me.

24:25.880 --> 24:27.245
Well, it wasn't this me.

24:27.440 --> 24:29.568
- It was another one. I saw him.
- Ash, what did you do?

24:29.720 --> 24:31.688
I'm telling you
there's another me around here!

24:33.680 --> 24:36.206
Come on out,
you ugly bastard.

24:36.360 --> 24:38.442
Olly, olly, oxen free.

24:42.920 --> 24:44.968
Lookin' for me?

24:46.080 --> 24:48.765
You didn't deserve her, Ash.

24:48.960 --> 24:51.440
I know, 'cause I'm just like you.

24:51.600 --> 24:54.763
Well, then that means
you got a trick knee.

24:55.760 --> 24:58.127
Ah! My trick knee!

25:00.640 --> 25:01.971
Sore kidneys.

25:04.640 --> 25:06.165
Fake teeth.

25:15.640 --> 25:18.246
- Bum shoulder.
- Ah!

25:18.400 --> 25:19.811
Soft balls.

25:19.960 --> 25:21.450
Oh! Oh!

25:27.800 --> 25:33.330
