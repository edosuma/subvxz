00:43.803 --> 00:46.604
CHARLES: Mrs. Johnson,
may I ask how you found me?

00:46.606 --> 00:50.675
I was given your name through
my friend Margaret Gibson.

00:51.945 --> 00:53.945
She and I used
to be in pictures together.

00:53.947 --> 00:56.681
She said you
were able to help her

00:56.683 --> 00:59.384
with her... problem.

00:59.386 --> 01:00.885
Margaret, yes.

01:00.887 --> 01:02.887
She's a lovely girl.

01:02.889 --> 01:06.891
I'm married, you see.

01:06.893 --> 01:09.894
My husband doesn't even know
that I'm expecting...

01:09.896 --> 01:13.898
Mrs. Johnson, you don't need
to explain anything to me.

01:13.900 --> 01:17.135
I'm here to help you.

01:17.137 --> 01:19.704
So, how far along are you?

01:32.318 --> 01:34.185
Three weeks.

01:37.390 --> 01:39.457
Please.

01:55.708 --> 01:57.075
Just through there.

02:05.118 --> 02:07.118
(whispering): Doctor,
there must be something wrong

02:07.120 --> 02:08.920
with this thermometer.

02:08.922 --> 02:10.922
It says her body temperature
is 75 degrees.

02:10.924 --> 02:11.923
Can that be right?

02:11.925 --> 02:12.924
Don't be a fool.

02:12.926 --> 02:14.292
She'd be dead.

02:15.962 --> 02:19.263
All right, my dear,
I want you to breathe in

02:19.265 --> 02:21.332
and count backwards.

02:23.970 --> 02:25.770
There you are.

02:25.772 --> 02:27.071
Shh...

02:27.073 --> 02:30.108
Very good.

02:30.110 --> 02:32.176
Shh...

02:35.582 --> 02:38.382
There you are.

02:38.384 --> 02:40.384
Get me the big knife.

02:40.386 --> 02:42.353
¶ ¶

02:51.931 --> 02:52.864
Ready the pan.

02:56.169 --> 02:57.235
(splatters)

02:59.939 --> 03:01.272
Closing her up.

03:01.274 --> 03:03.141
Nurse, dispose of that.

03:03.143 --> 03:05.810
I think it's still alive.

03:07.313 --> 03:08.646
(screams)

03:11.017 --> 03:12.316
(growling)

03:12.318 --> 03:14.886
(flesh ripping)

03:24.130 --> 03:27.999
Congratulations, it's a boy.

05:05.298 --> 05:06.430
Hi, Daddy.

05:11.304 --> 05:13.604
(Holden's laughter echoes)

05:13.606 --> 05:15.706
Holden?

05:16.409 --> 05:17.775
Holden!

05:44.103 --> 05:45.970
¶ ¶

05:58.985 --> 06:00.484
Oh.

06:12.365 --> 06:15.333
¶ Well, I'm down
on my knees again ¶

06:15.335 --> 06:18.936
¶ And I pray to the only one ¶

06:18.938 --> 06:23.374
¶ Who has the strength
to bear the pain ¶

06:23.376 --> 06:26.310
¶ To forgive all the things
that I've done ¶

06:26.312 --> 06:29.714
¶ Oh, girl ¶

06:29.716 --> 06:33.184
¶ Lead me into your darkness ¶

06:33.186 --> 06:37.288
¶ When this world
is trying its hardest ¶

06:37.290 --> 06:42.326
¶ To leave me unimpressed ¶

06:42.328 --> 06:45.129
¶ Just one caress ¶

06:45.131 --> 06:49.900
¶ From you and I'm blessed... ¶

06:54.407 --> 06:56.474
TRISTAN:
<i> Why is it so good with you?</i>

06:56.476 --> 06:58.242
LIZ:
<i> Because you're an orphan.</i>

06:58.244 --> 07:00.244
Orphans love
girls like me

07:00.246 --> 07:02.913
because it's like Mommy
and Daddy are both in the room.

07:04.417 --> 07:06.417
Loving you to pieces.

07:06.419 --> 07:09.153
(faintly):
¶ Every avenue ¶

07:09.155 --> 07:11.155
¶ Take one more look ¶

07:11.157 --> 07:13.257
¶ At what you found old ¶

07:13.259 --> 07:15.860
¶ And in it you'll find
something new... ¶

07:15.862 --> 07:17.862
Oh.

07:17.864 --> 07:19.930
I got you something.

07:22.835 --> 07:25.336
Just to get
you started.

07:25.338 --> 07:27.838
The basics--
Bronte and Wilde.

07:27.840 --> 07:30.608
Oh, you're gonna
love Wilde.

07:30.610 --> 07:32.676
Wow.

07:34.380 --> 07:36.080
Thanks, Liz.

07:36.082 --> 07:38.682
I don't think I've
read anything in years

07:38.684 --> 07:40.451
that didn't have the
month and a picture

07:40.453 --> 07:42.520
of Jennifer Aniston or
Kim K. on the cover.

07:42.522 --> 07:43.954
(chuckles)

07:43.956 --> 07:47.458
I never did any real reading
till I moved out here.

07:47.460 --> 07:50.461
Part of it was all
the free time at the desk,

07:50.463 --> 07:54.265
but I also think you can't
shut down one part of yourself

07:54.267 --> 07:56.567
without shutting down
the whole thing.

07:56.569 --> 07:59.303
And when I let
the Liz out,

07:59.305 --> 08:02.072
I could see and feel

08:02.074 --> 08:04.775
and... taste.

08:04.777 --> 08:06.844
And love.

08:09.282 --> 08:10.648
Do you love me?

08:15.555 --> 08:19.824
Oh...

08:19.826 --> 08:21.325
I don't know.

08:21.327 --> 08:23.627
I think so,

08:23.629 --> 08:27.898
but, goddamn it, who can tell
when you're so damn handsome?

08:32.438 --> 08:34.505
I think I love you.

08:36.342 --> 08:38.642
Don't tease me.
I'm serious.

08:38.644 --> 08:41.145
When I come down to
the lobby and see you,

08:41.147 --> 08:45.216
it's like... you're
genuinely happy to see me.

08:46.452 --> 08:48.552
I believe you.

08:53.125 --> 08:55.426
When you come down,

08:55.428 --> 08:58.429
it's like...

08:58.431 --> 09:00.498
it's like it's
Christmas morning for me.

09:05.438 --> 09:08.439
I mean, no one's ever felt
that way about me before.

09:08.441 --> 09:10.441
Ever.

09:10.443 --> 09:11.942
No one's even thought
I was smart enough

09:11.944 --> 09:13.477
to give real books to.

09:13.479 --> 09:14.712
(Liz scoffs)

09:14.714 --> 09:17.281
And you want to know
the weirdest part?

09:17.283 --> 09:21.485
When we screw, I swear,

09:21.487 --> 09:23.721
(chuckling): I've never
come harder in my life.

09:23.723 --> 09:26.290
(Liz laughs)

09:26.292 --> 09:28.192
It's so bizarre.

09:28.194 --> 09:30.961
Uh, I'm not gay or anything.

09:30.963 --> 09:35.566
You're not gay
for being with me.

09:35.568 --> 09:37.568
I'm a girl.

09:37.570 --> 09:39.737
I'm a hetero girl.

09:48.581 --> 09:52.883
Thank you...
for seeing the girl.

09:52.885 --> 09:54.552
(Liz crying)

09:54.554 --> 09:56.086
Hey.

09:57.890 --> 10:00.391
Why are you crying?

10:00.393 --> 10:04.395
Because I do love you.

10:04.397 --> 10:06.764
And I know this
doesn't end well.

10:06.766 --> 10:08.566
And it shouldn't.

10:08.568 --> 10:12.536
Not after what I've
done to The Countess.

10:12.538 --> 10:13.904
She gave me everything.

10:13.906 --> 10:15.573
It's wrong what
we're doing to her.

10:15.575 --> 10:16.574
Hey.

10:16.576 --> 10:18.776
How can love be wrong?

10:18.778 --> 10:22.346
If she could just
see us together,

10:22.348 --> 10:23.847
she'd understand.

10:26.052 --> 10:28.118
¶ ¶

10:56.082 --> 10:59.617
Do you want me to do
something different?

10:59.619 --> 11:01.885
(groans) This always
to me with women.

11:01.887 --> 11:03.454
I love them.

11:03.456 --> 11:05.522
I love their
bodies and...

11:07.493 --> 11:09.560
...and their femininity

11:09.562 --> 11:13.063
and their sex...

11:13.065 --> 11:16.133
but my cock and my mind
operate separately.

11:18.738 --> 11:20.504
I'm very embarrassed.

11:20.506 --> 11:22.306
Hardly embarrassing.

11:22.308 --> 11:25.309
This isn't a crisis.

11:25.311 --> 11:27.678
It's a...

11:27.680 --> 11:30.814
invitation for an adventure.

11:35.621 --> 11:38.322
(cell phone buzzes)

11:41.293 --> 11:43.661
I'm sorry.

11:44.664 --> 11:46.830
I got to go.

11:48.668 --> 11:50.134
Don't...

11:50.136 --> 11:54.672
don't talk to her about
us... just yet, okay?

11:54.674 --> 11:58.709
Let it be just ours...
for a little while longer.

11:58.711 --> 12:01.311
¶ It's the mood
that I am in... ¶

12:01.313 --> 12:03.113
I love you.

12:03.115 --> 12:05.115
¶ That's left us
back where we began ¶

12:05.117 --> 12:08.652
¶ Oh, girl ¶

12:08.654 --> 12:11.121
¶ Lead me into your darkness ¶

12:11.123 --> 12:13.323
¶ When this world... ¶

12:13.325 --> 12:15.325
What's this?

12:15.327 --> 12:16.860
I need some help with Mr. Drake.

12:16.862 --> 12:18.729
I'm not gay.

12:18.731 --> 12:20.030
Bullshit.

12:20.032 --> 12:21.799
A few weeks ago, you
were in my office

12:21.801 --> 12:23.333
telling me about all the
dick you took in prison.

12:23.335 --> 12:24.635
I was messing
with you, man.

12:24.637 --> 12:26.970
I made up all
that jail stuff.

12:26.972 --> 12:29.740
I had my reasons.

12:32.244 --> 12:34.745
Just fluff him up
for me a bit, baby.

12:34.747 --> 12:36.313
I'll finish him off.

12:36.315 --> 12:37.715
I don't want to.

12:37.717 --> 12:38.916
I'm not into it.

12:38.918 --> 12:41.318
¶ Into your darkness ¶

12:41.320 --> 12:43.320
¶ When this world
is trying its hardest... ¶

12:43.322 --> 12:45.656
You are for
the next hour.

12:45.658 --> 12:49.660
¶ To leave me unimpressed ¶

12:49.662 --> 12:53.697
¶ Just one caress ¶

12:53.699 --> 12:57.835
¶ From you and I'm blessed. ¶

13:07.179 --> 13:09.246
I need your help.

13:11.684 --> 13:14.718
Judging by how fast you put
your nose up in the air

13:14.720 --> 13:16.954
when I offered you an evening
of backgammon and rosé--

13:16.956 --> 13:20.758
to welcome you, no less--
I'm really not your girl.

13:20.760 --> 13:23.227
John somehow discovered
the sleeping chamber.

13:23.229 --> 13:25.796
Where is he now?

13:25.798 --> 13:27.965
I gave him two milligrams
of Versed

13:27.967 --> 13:29.967
to keep him out for
a couple of hours.

13:29.969 --> 13:32.736
He can't know about
Holden and me.

13:32.738 --> 13:34.938
I almost died when I lost him.

13:35.908 --> 13:37.708
I get it.

13:37.710 --> 13:40.544
That once-in-
a-lifetime love,

13:40.546 --> 13:42.780
it's the only thing
that can gut you raw

13:42.782 --> 13:46.817
and make your world
pyrotechnic in color.

13:46.819 --> 13:48.952
Everyone's entitled
to one true love.

13:51.257 --> 13:54.158
There's a broom
and a dustpan

13:54.160 --> 13:56.160
in the cleaning closet,
Nanny McPhee.

13:56.162 --> 13:58.962
We got to get rid
of those coffins.

14:24.924 --> 14:26.256
Where am I?

14:28.861 --> 14:30.661
I just saw you.

14:30.663 --> 14:32.663
In a coffin.

14:32.665 --> 14:35.966
You called me, John.

14:35.968 --> 14:38.101
You said you were
having visions,

14:38.103 --> 14:40.637
and you were afraid,
and you asked me to come,

14:40.639 --> 14:42.873
and so I did.

14:42.875 --> 14:45.876
I found you lying in the hallway
outside your room.

14:48.113 --> 14:50.113
(groans)

14:50.115 --> 14:53.116
No, I was asleep.

14:53.118 --> 14:56.653
Holden... came in

14:56.655 --> 14:59.456
and woke me up

14:59.458 --> 15:02.960
and told me to follow him
down to the basement where...

15:02.962 --> 15:05.662
Where there was
an empty swimming pool?

15:05.664 --> 15:08.832
Filled with sleeping
children in glass coffins?

15:08.834 --> 15:13.637
You realize this is exactly
what Scarlett told us.

15:13.639 --> 15:16.640
Her exact memories.

15:16.642 --> 15:18.308
It makes sense,
doesn't it?

15:18.310 --> 15:20.711
They become your own... visions.

15:20.713 --> 15:22.012
Alex, I'm telling you
what happened.

15:22.014 --> 15:24.681
I think
you're having a psychotic break.

15:24.683 --> 15:27.651
I think you've been heading
this way for a while.

15:27.653 --> 15:28.886
You need to get out of here,

15:28.888 --> 15:30.420
and you need to get
professional help.

15:30.422 --> 15:33.223
No, I'm going down to that room.

15:33.225 --> 15:34.725
I'm gonna see it for myself.

15:34.727 --> 15:37.094
You can come with me
if you want.

15:38.931 --> 15:40.998

16:05.457 --> 16:07.524
¶ ¶

16:26.078 --> 16:28.211
¶ ¶

16:42.795 --> 16:44.861
COUNTESS:
Hello, my love.

16:57.076 --> 17:00.077
Darling, I wanted
to say good-bye.

17:00.079 --> 17:03.080
Mama's going to Paris.

17:03.082 --> 17:05.349
And when I get back,
I'll have so much money,

17:05.351 --> 17:08.819
I'll never have
to leave you ever again.

17:08.821 --> 17:10.887
I promise.

17:27.339 --> 17:29.406
¶ ¶

17:43.989 --> 17:46.923
(elevator bell dings)

17:53.132 --> 17:54.898
What are you doing?

17:54.900 --> 17:56.233
She's gone.

17:58.070 --> 17:59.836
We can do anything we want.

17:59.838 --> 18:01.038
So what?

18:01.040 --> 18:03.173
You want to trash
her penthouse?

18:03.175 --> 18:05.876
You know why we're here.

18:07.679 --> 18:10.480
Going to the basement.

18:10.482 --> 18:12.549
Take care of those kiddies.

18:16.722 --> 18:18.255
What's the matter?

18:18.257 --> 18:19.923
You going soft on me?

18:19.925 --> 18:22.025
Why? Because I don't want
to murder some children?

18:22.027 --> 18:25.062
Oh, well,
I might tear up.

18:25.064 --> 18:27.998
You don't give two shits
about those kids.

18:28.000 --> 18:30.133
It's not about them.

18:31.904 --> 18:34.704
But you know when I stab
at their little hearts,

18:34.706 --> 18:36.239
I'll be stabbing at hers,

18:36.241 --> 18:39.276
and you're still
not over her.

18:39.278 --> 18:40.677
And you are?

18:40.679 --> 18:42.179
You're obsessed.

18:42.181 --> 18:43.613
(elevator bell dings)

18:46.518 --> 18:49.920
Fine.

18:52.024 --> 18:55.092
You go...
sniff her panties.

18:55.094 --> 18:58.195
I'll take care of this myself.

19:05.904 --> 19:08.205
Oh...

19:08.207 --> 19:09.873
Well, son of a bitch!

19:09.875 --> 19:12.375
IRIS:
Where the hell are they?

19:12.377 --> 19:13.910
RAMONA:
How should I know?

19:13.912 --> 19:15.946
You been flapping that mouth?

19:15.948 --> 19:17.047
Hell, no.

19:17.049 --> 19:18.582
I was ready
to do this.

19:18.584 --> 19:20.250
Well, guess you were.

19:20.252 --> 19:21.985
Damn, woman.

19:21.987 --> 19:23.587
What's got into you?

19:23.589 --> 19:26.056
About six pints
of O-negative

19:26.058 --> 19:29.126
from a couple of
smart alecks in room 36.

19:32.731 --> 19:34.164
It's a whole new you.

19:34.166 --> 19:35.599
Damn straight
it is.

19:35.601 --> 19:40.070
That boy of yours pussed out,
but not you.

19:40.072 --> 19:42.405
You must really hate
the little shits.

19:42.407 --> 19:44.074
Nah, I don't
hate 'em.

19:44.076 --> 19:46.176
Maybe even love 'em
a little.

19:46.178 --> 19:48.111
It's her I hate.

19:48.113 --> 19:51.114
That's why those kids
have got to go first.

19:51.116 --> 19:53.183
They're her reason
for living.

19:53.185 --> 19:54.284
That's cold.

19:54.286 --> 19:55.785
No.

19:55.787 --> 19:58.255
It's a kindness.

19:58.257 --> 19:59.756
This is no place
for children.

19:59.758 --> 20:01.158
Come on, let's go
find the kids.

20:01.160 --> 20:02.492
No, no, no, no.

20:02.494 --> 20:03.960
You find them,

20:03.962 --> 20:06.129
'cause it sounds like
you know what to do.

20:06.131 --> 20:08.365
But even with that done,
she'll still have

20:08.367 --> 20:10.433
one little reason
to go on,

20:10.435 --> 20:12.202
and I'm gonna tend to that.

20:12.204 --> 20:16.439
So give me the key
to room 33.

20:20.145 --> 20:22.212
¶ ¶

20:46.171 --> 20:48.238
(inhales)

20:49.408 --> 20:51.474
(exhales)

20:54.379 --> 20:55.679
AGNETHA:
Excuse me.

20:55.681 --> 20:57.247
Can you show us
to the line

20:57.249 --> 20:58.481
to the Fast & Furious--
Supercharged?

20:58.483 --> 21:01.851
We are lost in this
hotel for so long.

21:01.853 --> 21:03.420
It's like a maze.

21:03.422 --> 21:07.390
You're never going to see
Vin Diesel in 3-D

21:07.392 --> 21:10.594
because you can't
leave this hotel.

21:10.596 --> 21:12.362
You understand?

21:12.364 --> 21:15.098
I told you, Agnetha,

21:15.100 --> 21:16.900
we are dead.

21:16.902 --> 21:19.436
Why do you think
you're dead?

21:21.073 --> 21:23.240
Because everything
I put in my mouth

21:23.242 --> 21:25.375
tastes like chalk.
I love food.

21:25.377 --> 21:26.710
AGNETHA:
Don't listen to him,
Vendela.

21:26.712 --> 21:28.044
Come.

21:28.046 --> 21:29.379
We'll find a way out.

21:29.381 --> 21:30.680
Nope.

21:30.682 --> 21:33.049
Vendela's right.

21:33.051 --> 21:35.185
Until you find a purpose,

21:35.187 --> 21:38.255
you'll both be stuck
in an unbreakable chain,

21:38.257 --> 21:40.890
repeating yourselves
over and over again.

21:40.892 --> 21:43.193
(screaming)

21:43.195 --> 21:45.362
How hard is it

21:45.364 --> 21:48.365
to get some goddamn kale
around here?!

21:48.367 --> 21:51.134
It's the power
of the hotel.

21:51.136 --> 21:53.803
Makes you lose your compass.

21:53.805 --> 21:55.372
Your sense of yourself.

21:56.308 --> 21:58.241
Of anything.

21:58.243 --> 22:01.611
But there are those who have
broken out of that cycle.

22:06.385 --> 22:08.318
Her name was Cara.

22:08.320 --> 22:10.820
She was an elementary
school teacher.

22:10.822 --> 22:13.256
<i> She had so much love to give</i>

22:13.258 --> 22:15.725
<i> but nobody to give it to.</i>

22:17.129 --> 22:19.729
<i> She came to the Cortez</i>
<i> to end it all.</i>

22:28.440 --> 22:31.041
I love the bouquet
of rotting flesh.

22:34.746 --> 22:38.181
DONOVAN:
<i> Cara was sitting</i>
<i> in that tub for months.</i>

22:38.183 --> 22:40.250
<i> Decomposing.</i>

22:49.361 --> 22:52.262
<i> Never drink the water</i>
<i> from the fifth floor,</i>

22:52.264 --> 22:54.297
<i> unless you want</i>
<i> a taste of Cara.</i>

22:54.299 --> 22:56.766
She was like us?

22:56.768 --> 22:58.101
Aimless.

22:58.103 --> 23:00.870
Leaving wet spots on the floor.

23:00.872 --> 23:03.940
Until she found
her purpose.

23:11.183 --> 23:11.881
(screams)

23:14.186 --> 23:18.321
Cara enjoyed terrorizing
the hotel guests.

23:18.323 --> 23:20.390
(chuckles)

23:20.392 --> 23:23.626
She was quite fond of the pool
until they drained it.

23:23.628 --> 23:25.962
So if we find
our purpose,

23:25.964 --> 23:27.731
we can leave
the hotel?

23:27.733 --> 23:29.366
You don't get to leave.

23:29.368 --> 23:32.635
All you get is a reprieve
from the hamster wheel.

23:32.637 --> 23:36.339
Eternity can be tedious

23:36.341 --> 23:39.642
without something enjoyable
to break up the day.

23:39.644 --> 23:42.379
What about you?

23:42.381 --> 23:45.415
What's your
purpose?

23:45.417 --> 23:47.484
I lost mine when I lost her.

24:06.838 --> 24:10.507
Oh, Bartholomew...

24:15.747 --> 24:17.747
Bartholomew...

24:17.749 --> 24:21.418
where are you?

24:21.420 --> 24:26.556
Aw, come on out,
love bug.

24:26.558 --> 24:28.958
It's Auntie Ramona.

24:37.602 --> 24:40.537
Oh...

24:40.539 --> 24:43.873
I've missed you.

24:43.875 --> 24:46.543
Auntie Ramona's here.

24:48.280 --> 24:50.780
(laughs)

24:50.782 --> 24:52.515
Aw...

24:55.887 --> 24:57.954
Bartholomew...

25:03.462 --> 25:04.561
(Ramona gasps)

25:06.932 --> 25:08.965
(quiet snarling)

25:12.404 --> 25:14.971
Bartholomew.

25:19.344 --> 25:20.510
Oh...

25:25.917 --> 25:28.818
I've got a surprise for you.

25:30.422 --> 25:31.488
(trilling, hissing)

25:31.490 --> 25:33.556
¶ ¶

25:58.850 --> 26:00.950
I left his door open
and the dish out,

26:00.952 --> 26:02.719
so it's possible he may
just crawl back in there.

26:02.721 --> 26:04.521
He can't have
gotten far.

26:04.523 --> 26:08.057
We need to find him before
The Countess gets back,

26:08.059 --> 26:09.692
or there'll be hell to pay.

26:14.799 --> 26:16.499
You want some more ice for that?

26:16.501 --> 26:18.334
Mmm.

26:18.336 --> 26:20.570
Mmm, naw.

26:20.572 --> 26:22.805
It'll be all healed
up in an hour.

26:24.643 --> 26:26.309
Did you find it?

26:26.311 --> 26:28.678
It's being taken care of.

26:28.680 --> 26:30.713
That thing

26:30.715 --> 26:33.483
should've died way back
when it was supposed to.

26:33.485 --> 26:34.751
Same thing
could be said

26:34.753 --> 26:36.753
for a lot of people
around here.

26:36.755 --> 26:38.888
Which is why

26:38.890 --> 26:41.324
I have to ask you to leave.

26:41.326 --> 26:44.093
Oh!
Not that it's not been
nice having you here.

26:44.095 --> 26:46.496
It is, I have missed you.

26:46.498 --> 26:49.566
All the other girls around here
are either dead or dumpy.

26:49.568 --> 26:50.600
(laughs)

26:50.602 --> 26:52.769
But I can't have
any upsets.

26:52.771 --> 26:54.537
Not now.
Why?

26:54.539 --> 26:55.572
What's going on?

26:55.574 --> 26:59.576
Come on, spill the tea.

26:59.578 --> 27:01.311
I'm in love.

27:03.014 --> 27:05.748
Finally

27:05.750 --> 27:08.551
and for the first time
in my life.

27:08.553 --> 27:10.553
Well, I'll be damned.

27:10.555 --> 27:12.255
I sensed a glow.

27:12.257 --> 27:13.556
Yeah?
Who is he?

27:13.558 --> 27:15.058
Oh!

27:15.060 --> 27:16.759
Not one of them
rough trade corner boys

27:16.761 --> 27:19.529
you always liked
too much?
No.

27:19.531 --> 27:22.231
His name is Tristan.

27:22.233 --> 27:24.634
He's young.

27:24.636 --> 27:26.202
He's beautiful.

27:26.204 --> 27:29.539
He's...
exquisitely damaged.

27:29.541 --> 27:32.442
He's mine.

27:32.444 --> 27:33.743
Mostly.

27:33.745 --> 27:35.545
Tristan?

27:35.547 --> 27:38.715
Isn't that the name of
The Countess' new squeeze?

27:38.717 --> 27:39.983
She doesn't love him.

27:39.985 --> 27:41.384
Of course
she doesn't.

27:41.386 --> 27:42.785
You think that's
gonna matter?

27:42.787 --> 27:45.989
Look, if you really
want to be with this boy,

27:45.991 --> 27:48.825
what you need
to do is run.

27:48.827 --> 27:51.661
Tristan is a passing
fancy for her.

27:51.663 --> 27:53.596
If I am really honest with her,

27:53.598 --> 27:55.598
if I tell her from the heart

27:55.600 --> 27:58.601
what we mean to each other,
she will understand.

27:58.603 --> 28:02.705
Oh, she will rip that heart
right out of your chest.

28:04.275 --> 28:06.542
Just know when
it's time to run.

28:08.480 --> 28:10.747
(sobbing)

28:31.002 --> 28:33.503
We just wanted
to stop walking.

28:33.505 --> 28:35.838
What?

28:35.840 --> 28:37.140
I can't hear...

28:37.142 --> 28:39.208
Tino, you're breaking up.

28:39.210 --> 28:42.712
Come on, man,
it's going to be epic.

28:42.714 --> 28:45.448
Okay? I need my wingman.

28:45.450 --> 28:46.716
I got a room.

28:46.718 --> 28:48.651
Will Drake's hotel downtown.

28:48.653 --> 28:51.721
Gotta be a ton
of models hanging out.

28:51.723 --> 28:54.524
Hello? Tino?

28:54.526 --> 28:55.725
(phone beeping)

28:55.727 --> 28:57.126
Shit.

29:04.736 --> 29:06.369
Are you lost?

29:06.371 --> 29:07.970
I'm looking for a ride.

29:07.972 --> 29:09.572
Maybe you found one.

29:09.574 --> 29:11.074
Fast & the Furious.

29:11.076 --> 29:12.442
I can do that.

29:14.713 --> 29:18.581
Or it can be... slow

29:18.583 --> 29:19.949
and sweet.

29:21.753 --> 29:23.820
(grunting)

29:33.898 --> 29:36.532
Jesus!

29:36.534 --> 29:37.667
Who the hell are you?

29:37.669 --> 29:39.669
That's my friend
Vendela.

29:39.671 --> 29:42.271
I want to play.

29:42.273 --> 29:44.607
(giggles)

29:46.544 --> 29:47.744
Oh, I get it.

29:49.714 --> 29:51.881
This is some kind of scam.

29:51.883 --> 29:53.683
You two are pros.

29:53.685 --> 29:56.419
I'm getting double-teamed
and then you make me pay.

29:56.421 --> 29:58.187
No way, Jose.

29:58.189 --> 30:00.957
Mr. Woo does not
pay for pussy.

30:05.797 --> 30:07.597
I'm gonna take a leak.

30:07.599 --> 30:09.866
You two better be gone
when I come out.

30:19.711 --> 30:22.512
No more hallways.

30:25.750 --> 30:27.984
(crashing, glass breaking)

30:27.986 --> 30:30.820
(stabbing, gasping)

30:36.227 --> 30:38.728
VENDELA:
Go after him!

30:38.730 --> 30:40.129
(screaming)

30:44.836 --> 30:46.903
(laughing)

30:54.279 --> 30:55.611
Who are you?

30:55.613 --> 30:57.446
A friend.

30:57.448 --> 31:00.016
My name's Alex.

31:00.018 --> 31:01.851
Who is he?

31:01.853 --> 31:04.821
Just some stupid guy
with a big hard-on.

31:04.823 --> 31:06.622
(sniffs)

31:06.624 --> 31:08.758
We were trying
to find our purpose.

31:08.760 --> 31:12.628
So you're not upset
because he's dead?

31:12.630 --> 31:15.164
Killing him was nothing.

31:15.166 --> 31:16.465
That's the problem.

31:16.467 --> 31:17.800
(sniffs)

31:17.802 --> 31:19.635
I sort of feel
sorry for him.

31:19.637 --> 31:20.870
AGNETHA:
Me, too.

31:20.872 --> 31:22.638
We can't go back
to the hallways.

31:22.640 --> 31:24.307
You don't have to.

31:24.309 --> 31:27.043
You can find your purpose
without killing them.

31:28.279 --> 31:30.112
What do we do?

31:30.114 --> 31:31.914
You can break their minds.

31:34.118 --> 31:36.519
I have the
perfect idea.

31:38.823 --> 31:40.823
I know this guy.

31:40.825 --> 31:42.191
He's always wanted two girls.

31:53.838 --> 31:55.838
(indistinct radio transmission)

31:55.840 --> 31:57.840
(indistinct conversation)

31:57.842 --> 32:00.476
Excuse me a second.

32:00.478 --> 32:01.744
Lowe.

32:01.746 --> 32:03.145
What are you
doing here?

32:03.147 --> 32:04.847
It's another one, isn't it?

32:04.849 --> 32:06.883
How was the victim posed?
Who called you about this?

32:06.885 --> 32:08.251
I have a police scanner
in my room.

32:08.253 --> 32:09.719
It's a Commandment murder.

32:09.721 --> 32:10.820
Nothing's been determined.

32:10.822 --> 32:12.221
We just began to process
the crime scene.

32:12.223 --> 32:13.756
Yeah.

32:13.758 --> 32:15.892
Don't pull this shit
on me now.

32:33.011 --> 32:35.077
Yeah.

32:37.048 --> 32:38.748
HAHN:
All right, come on.

32:38.750 --> 32:40.182
Come on.
Yeah.

32:40.184 --> 32:41.951
It all fits.

32:41.953 --> 32:43.386
A televangelist.
He's preaching

32:43.388 --> 32:44.453
the gospel of prosperity.

32:44.455 --> 32:45.888
He used the word of God

32:45.890 --> 32:47.957
to make money.
It's another commandment.

32:47.959 --> 32:49.725
Thou shalt not take
the Lord's name in vain.

32:49.727 --> 32:51.394
I can be useful
to this case, Andy.

32:51.396 --> 32:53.896
We don't need you, John.

32:53.898 --> 32:55.164
We got somebody
in custody.

33:03.908 --> 33:05.708
(line ringing)

33:05.710 --> 33:06.976
(beeping)

33:06.978 --> 33:09.045
¶ ¶

33:14.385 --> 33:16.986
Plenty of seats
down at the bar.

33:21.059 --> 33:22.124
What are you doing up here?

33:22.126 --> 33:23.492
Nothing.

33:25.430 --> 33:28.097
Looking for some... one.

33:28.099 --> 33:30.633
You okay?

33:32.403 --> 33:34.070
I love my kids.

33:36.808 --> 33:38.874
I love my wife.

33:40.745 --> 33:45.214
It's not my fault
I'm so shitty at it, is it?

33:48.920 --> 33:51.587
Why don't I help you
to your room?

33:51.589 --> 33:54.156
Get to bed.

33:55.259 --> 33:57.960
No telling
what kinds of undesirables

33:57.962 --> 34:00.596
you're going to run into
out in the halls.

34:00.598 --> 34:03.766
Those undesirables
should be worried

34:03.768 --> 34:05.868
about running into me right now.

34:05.870 --> 34:08.037
John?

34:08.039 --> 34:10.373
Come on.

34:10.375 --> 34:11.941
Come on.

34:11.943 --> 34:13.542
Come on.
No.

34:13.544 --> 34:15.845
No, don't take this from me!

34:15.847 --> 34:17.880
This is my breakdown--
I'm gonna have it.

34:22.987 --> 34:25.855
(women giggling nearby)

34:29.027 --> 34:31.127
I'm sorry.
Are you okay?

34:38.136 --> 34:39.168
Are you looking for Liz?

34:39.170 --> 34:40.202
No.

34:40.204 --> 34:42.071
We are looking for you.

34:42.073 --> 34:45.141
("Jack the Ripper" by Nick Cave
and the Bad Seeds playing)

34:51.983 --> 34:56.519
¶ I got a woman ¶

34:56.521 --> 34:59.889
¶ She rules my house
with an iron fist ¶

34:59.891 --> 35:01.657
¶<i> Hey</i> ¶

35:04.862 --> 35:07.930
¶<i> Hey</i> ¶

35:07.932 --> 35:11.700
¶ She screams out
"Jack the Ripper" ¶

35:11.702 --> 35:16.405
¶ Every time I try to give
that girl a kiss ¶

35:16.407 --> 35:18.407
¶<i> Hey</i> ¶

35:18.409 --> 35:19.942
¶ Oh, yeah ¶

35:19.944 --> 35:23.712
¶<i> Hey</i> ¶

35:23.714 --> 35:26.749
¶ Oh, well, I got a woman ¶

35:26.751 --> 35:31.353
¶ She strikes me down
with a fist of lead ¶

35:31.355 --> 35:33.055
¶<i> Hey</i> ¶

35:33.057 --> 35:35.458
¶ Oh, yeah ¶

35:35.460 --> 35:37.426
¶<i> Hey</i> ¶

35:37.428 --> 35:40.329
¶ She screams out
"Jack the Ripper." ¶

35:42.633 --> 35:46.001
Looks like that breakdown
is going well.

35:49.073 --> 35:51.140
Is that your blood?

35:52.877 --> 35:55.845
I don't know.

35:58.649 --> 36:00.049
Where are the girls?

36:00.051 --> 36:02.051
Look at the right
old mess you've made.

36:02.053 --> 36:04.086
This much blood
will take three washings.

36:04.088 --> 36:06.755
The sheets will lose
their thick pile.

36:06.757 --> 36:10.126
Mr. Man, thank you.

36:10.128 --> 36:11.961
You're much better
than a Universal Studio tour.

36:11.963 --> 36:14.396
Fast and furious.

36:14.398 --> 36:16.198
(both giggling)

36:19.403 --> 36:21.904
We have a purpose.

36:21.906 --> 36:23.072
Get out!

36:23.074 --> 36:24.607
Get out of my room!

36:24.609 --> 36:26.342
Harlots.

36:26.344 --> 36:27.943
Those Nordic types,

36:27.945 --> 36:30.246
they have no respect
for fresh linens.

36:30.248 --> 36:31.313
It's not in their culture.

36:31.315 --> 36:32.615
It's a well-known fact.

36:32.617 --> 36:33.682
You, too.

36:33.684 --> 36:36.252
Get out of my room.

36:38.422 --> 36:40.789
I haven't collected
the pillow cases yet...

36:40.791 --> 36:43.692
Get out of my room!

36:43.694 --> 36:46.262
MARCH:
John!

36:50.168 --> 36:52.168
Good to see you're

36:52.170 --> 36:54.203
finally, truly

36:54.205 --> 36:57.239
checking in to the Hotel Cortez.

36:58.309 --> 37:00.376
(screaming)

37:03.147 --> 37:05.214
(shouting)

37:30.675 --> 37:32.741
(water running)

37:47.258 --> 37:49.558
(elevator bell dings)

38:29.634 --> 38:31.900
You haven't said a word to me

38:31.902 --> 38:33.469
since I picked you up
at Dinah's.

38:33.471 --> 38:35.871
Where's your mom?

38:35.873 --> 38:37.940
How should I know?

38:39.410 --> 38:42.244
Do you know how
embarrassing it is

38:42.246 --> 38:44.146
when your friend asks
what time you're going home

38:44.148 --> 38:46.348
and your mom doesn't
even answer the phone?

38:48.252 --> 38:50.719
I'm sorry, honey.

38:50.721 --> 38:53.289
I'm sure there was
some kind of emergency.

38:53.291 --> 38:55.624
She hasn't called
me for two days.

38:55.626 --> 38:57.393
Are you leaving now?

38:57.395 --> 38:58.560
What?

38:58.562 --> 39:00.262
You don't live here anymore.

39:00.264 --> 39:01.230
No, I'm staying here

39:01.232 --> 39:03.299
until we sort this out, okay?

39:03.301 --> 39:04.700
I'll never leave you alone.

39:19.083 --> 39:21.350
(Scarlett crying)

39:34.965 --> 39:38.267
I know things seem crazy,
but you have to believe me,

39:38.269 --> 39:40.803
I-I'm gonna make
things right again.

39:40.805 --> 39:42.271
You can't.

39:42.273 --> 39:45.874
Not by yourself.

39:45.876 --> 39:48.444
I will talk to Mom.

39:50.214 --> 39:52.548
Is that blood?

40:02.460 --> 40:04.560
Dad...

40:04.562 --> 40:06.795
you're scaring me.

40:06.797 --> 40:10.032
No, this is nothing,
uh, um...

40:10.034 --> 40:12.501
It's an accident at the,
uh, at the hotel.

40:12.503 --> 40:14.770
I'm gonna go put it
in the laundry, okay?

40:43.868 --> 40:45.434
¶ ¶

41:11.395 --> 41:13.662
¶ ¶

41:22.039 --> 41:23.405
(screaming)

41:23.407 --> 41:25.240
Scarlett, are you all right?

41:25.242 --> 41:27.176
You stay away from me!
Stay away from me!

41:40.257 --> 41:42.124
(elevator bell dings)

41:42.126 --> 41:45.494
Ooh, look at that.

41:45.496 --> 41:48.230
Is there anything more beautiful
than a sleeping child?

41:48.232 --> 41:50.499
You last night.

41:54.438 --> 41:56.738
I love you.

41:56.740 --> 41:58.507
I'm gonna put him in bed.

41:58.509 --> 42:00.576
I fear I may pass out as well.

42:00.578 --> 42:02.478
One too many Klonopin
on the flight.

42:02.480 --> 42:03.612
Yes, sleep, my love.

42:03.614 --> 42:06.181
Rest those
two beautiful heads.

42:11.088 --> 42:12.754
Sounds like the trip went well.

42:12.756 --> 42:14.556
I enjoy him.

42:16.527 --> 42:18.594
You seem anxious.

42:18.596 --> 42:21.830
I can hear your heartbeat.

42:21.832 --> 42:23.699
Yes.

42:23.701 --> 42:27.102
There is...

42:27.104 --> 42:30.372
something I'd like to
speak with you about.

42:30.374 --> 42:31.974
Do you want
to have the surgery?

42:31.976 --> 42:35.177
Because I'm happy to pay
once Will and I finalize things.

42:35.179 --> 42:37.112
No, no.
No, not that.

42:37.114 --> 42:38.780
Never that, I think.

42:38.782 --> 42:41.617
Um, you see, this is...

42:41.619 --> 42:43.352
hmm...

42:43.354 --> 42:46.855
difficult for me and I know
that it may not mean something

42:46.857 --> 42:49.658
to someone like you who
does this all the time,

42:49.660 --> 42:51.193
but it seems,

42:51.195 --> 42:53.896
for the first time,
I've fallen in love.

42:53.898 --> 42:56.732
Well, why would that wonderful
news make you worry?

43:03.641 --> 43:05.941
It's Tristan.

43:08.979 --> 43:12.414
Interesting.

43:12.416 --> 43:14.550
How long?

43:14.552 --> 43:16.151
Not long.

43:16.153 --> 43:17.653
A couple of weeks.

43:17.655 --> 43:19.721
I know he's your current

43:19.723 --> 43:22.691
mild obsession,

43:22.693 --> 43:25.027
but I don't think you love him.

43:25.029 --> 43:26.528
Not like I do.

43:26.530 --> 43:29.164
You know me.

43:29.166 --> 43:31.500
You made me.

43:31.502 --> 43:35.571
I belong to you.

43:35.573 --> 43:39.575
But this is my one chance at it.

43:39.577 --> 43:42.678
I don't share.

43:43.781 --> 43:45.414
Maybe when I'm done with him.

43:46.550 --> 43:49.685
But time passes for me.

43:49.687 --> 43:51.219
You measure decades
by the changes in hemlines.

43:51.221 --> 43:52.254
It means nothing to you.

43:52.256 --> 43:54.556
You know
as well as anyone

43:54.558 --> 43:56.391
that we all just get

43:56.393 --> 43:59.928
one great one in our lives.

44:04.602 --> 44:06.768
Let's talk to the boy.

44:06.770 --> 44:09.705
Thank you.

44:11.609 --> 44:13.775
Thanks for calling me first,
Andy, I appreciate it.

44:13.777 --> 44:15.577
He's in bad shape, Alex.

44:15.579 --> 44:18.614
He's talking about monsters.

44:18.616 --> 44:21.717
Claims that's
what he's firing at.

44:21.719 --> 44:23.885
So, what do you think?

44:23.887 --> 44:26.755
You want to try
to speak to her again?

44:26.757 --> 44:29.591
No.

44:29.593 --> 44:32.227
No, I think it's best if you
get her to her grandma's.

44:32.229 --> 44:33.629
No problem.

44:35.633 --> 44:37.399
Take care of him.

44:37.401 --> 44:39.234
I will.

44:39.236 --> 44:41.470
(car door opens, closes)

44:41.472 --> 44:43.505
(engine starts)

45:02.826 --> 45:06.261
She's afraid of me.

45:06.263 --> 45:09.765
My own daughter.

45:09.767 --> 45:12.067
Maybe I am going crazy.

45:13.804 --> 45:17.039
I thought maybe if we got
out of that place...

45:17.041 --> 45:19.741
You are out of that place.

45:20.611 --> 45:21.877
That's all that matters.

45:21.879 --> 45:23.545
You just need some sleep.

45:23.547 --> 45:24.613
In your own house.

45:24.615 --> 45:26.515
In your own bed.

45:26.517 --> 45:28.583
It's your bed, too.

45:34.525 --> 45:37.893
You're going back there,
aren't you?

45:37.895 --> 45:40.629
I don't know
what you're talking about.

45:42.800 --> 45:44.766
Still playing that game?

45:46.637 --> 45:49.204
Okay.

45:51.475 --> 45:53.909
(door slams)

45:53.911 --> 45:56.545
(snarling nearby)

46:18.702 --> 46:21.770
¶ ¶

46:25.209 --> 46:27.275
(snarling)

46:36.754 --> 46:39.788
How was your trip?

46:40.958 --> 46:43.792
Welcome home.

46:45.562 --> 46:46.595
Sit, love.

46:46.597 --> 46:47.729
Who needs a drink?

46:47.731 --> 46:49.865
I'll get them.

46:49.867 --> 46:51.099
No, let me.

46:51.101 --> 46:53.668
You two sit.

46:57.908 --> 46:59.775
When you are what I am,

46:59.777 --> 47:02.644
you don't feel things
the way normal humans do.

47:02.646 --> 47:05.380
An emotion is like
a flavor in my mouth.

47:05.382 --> 47:07.315
I can taste it.

47:07.317 --> 47:10.752
Joy tastes
like strawberries.

47:10.754 --> 47:15.123
Hate is like ice chips
in a martini.

47:15.125 --> 47:18.593
And love is...

47:18.595 --> 47:21.429
rosewater.

47:21.431 --> 47:25.300
I enjoy them all
except for one.

47:27.604 --> 47:30.572
Betrayal.

47:30.574 --> 47:33.809
That has the taste of the char
on a piece of burnt meat.

47:33.811 --> 47:36.011
You told her.

47:36.013 --> 47:37.846
Yes.

47:37.848 --> 47:40.182
The one in the dress

47:40.184 --> 47:42.751
has more balls than you... babe.

47:42.753 --> 47:44.786
What do you expect?

47:44.788 --> 47:47.155
I'm just gonna spend my life

47:47.157 --> 47:49.925
crying over your broken promise?

47:51.195 --> 47:52.761
I know I'm dumb

47:52.763 --> 47:54.696
and I'm just a model,

47:54.698 --> 47:56.264
but I know you.

47:56.266 --> 47:59.034
It's not that you
get bored and move on.

47:59.036 --> 48:03.038
Moving on is the point
of the whole thing.

48:03.040 --> 48:05.874
That is your orgasm.

48:05.876 --> 48:07.676
You collect us

48:07.678 --> 48:09.311
and create us
and get us addicted

48:09.313 --> 48:10.879
to the light of your love

48:10.881 --> 48:13.815
just so you can take it away.

48:13.817 --> 48:16.284
You feed off
the heartbreak.

48:16.286 --> 48:19.721
Knowing we're out there,
suffering over you.

48:19.723 --> 48:21.890
Well, not me!

48:21.892 --> 48:23.992
I was made for more than that.

48:23.994 --> 48:27.963
For a real love.

48:27.965 --> 48:29.631
LIZ:
Please.

48:29.633 --> 48:31.299
After all I've done,

48:31.301 --> 48:33.935
let me just have this one.

48:37.741 --> 48:40.475
Is this what you
want as well?

48:52.422 --> 48:55.090
Fine.

48:55.092 --> 48:57.959
You may have him.

49:25.255 --> 49:27.255
He's yours.

49:27.257 --> 49:29.324
Bury him.

49:32.796 --> 49:34.863
(elevator bell dings)

50:04.094 --> 50:06.661
Alex?

50:09.566 --> 50:10.899
He was hurt.

50:10.901 --> 50:13.735
He got out?

50:13.737 --> 50:16.438
Yes, but I found him.

50:16.440 --> 50:19.441
He lost a little blood,

50:19.443 --> 50:22.010
but he's gonna be just fine.

50:34.925 --> 50:36.925
You saved my son.

50:36.927 --> 50:39.894
You saved mine.

51:07.858 --> 51:10.558
(shushing)
