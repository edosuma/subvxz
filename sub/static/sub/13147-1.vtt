00:15.711 --> 00:18.757
[music]

00:39.561 --> 00:43.565
[woman] Everything you face
in life, everything you
come up against,

00:43.608 --> 00:47.177
everything that stands in your
way, your foes,

00:47.221 --> 00:48.570
your fears,

00:48.613 --> 00:50.789
your darkest nights,

00:50.833 --> 00:53.879
are all sent to ask you
the same question,

00:55.316 --> 00:56.926
"Who are you?"

00:56.969 --> 01:00.408
Mr. Tabir is very busy
this morning.

01:00.451 --> 01:02.192
Oh, I can imagine.

01:06.936 --> 01:09.112
Seems we are waiting.

01:09.156 --> 01:12.898
Why don'’t you practice
a little pitch on me?

01:12.942 --> 01:15.510
Actually, if it'’s all
the same, I'’ll just-

01:15.553 --> 01:17.338
I know all
my uncle'’s business.

01:17.381 --> 01:19.079
He trusts me.

01:20.167 --> 01:21.472
Begin.

01:26.651 --> 01:31.395
Okay. Well, I'’m sure
you'’re aware, Mr.--

01:35.791 --> 01:38.489
You'’re aware that recently
your subsidiary,

01:38.533 --> 01:40.665
Signal Olio Chemicals,

01:40.709 --> 01:44.191
developed an organic
ester-based lubricant
derived from Kernel Oil

01:44.234 --> 01:48.151
that makes offshore drilling
significantly more
environmental.

01:48.195 --> 01:50.371
My company knows those-

01:50.414 --> 01:51.894
You'’re American?

01:51.937 --> 01:54.114
Canadian, actually,
from Toronto.

01:55.898 --> 01:57.552
You'’re a Maple Leaf fan?

01:57.595 --> 01:59.684
No, not really.

02:01.730 --> 02:04.646
You must be the only person from
Toronto who'’s not a hockey fan.

02:04.689 --> 02:06.387
Oh, I'’m a fan.

02:06.430 --> 02:09.433
Dad'’s from Vancouver,
so I'’m a Canuck.

02:09.477 --> 02:12.044
Between us,
the Maple Leafs suck.

02:12.088 --> 02:16.397
They should never have signed
Mark Bowen. The guy is a
liability on and off the ice.

02:16.440 --> 02:17.572
So, who'’s your team?

02:17.615 --> 02:19.139
I don'’t like hockey.

02:21.184 --> 02:22.620
Oh.

02:22.664 --> 02:25.797
Unfortunately, Mr. Tabir has
no window this morning.

02:25.841 --> 02:30.585
But tonight he extends
an invitation to a private
reception at his residence.

02:30.628 --> 02:33.196
Are you sure?
I really don'’t wish
to intrude.

02:33.240 --> 02:34.893
Come,

02:34.937 --> 02:36.243
to the party.

02:37.374 --> 02:43.293
[background noise]

02:45.948 --> 02:47.950
[background conversations]

02:50.909 --> 02:52.563
Thank you.
That'’s great.

02:53.738 --> 02:55.740
Thanks, George.

02:55.784 --> 02:57.829
Oh, would you excuse me
for one minute?

03:04.271 --> 03:06.925
Mr. Tabir, Jessica McDowell.

03:06.969 --> 03:09.972
Thank you for inviting me
to your beautiful home.

03:10.015 --> 03:11.669
What can I do for you?

03:11.713 --> 03:14.063
Well, I was wondering if you had
time to glance at my proposal

03:14.106 --> 03:17.632
which would allow us a signal
access to our current
petro-chemical service partners.

03:17.675 --> 03:19.416
Essentially, it would--

03:19.460 --> 03:21.984
[inaudible whispering]

03:22.027 --> 03:24.073
Excuse me.
I have to attend to something.

03:24.116 --> 03:25.988
I have something to
take care of.

03:26.031 --> 03:28.817
[background conversations]

03:45.225 --> 03:47.270
I was waiting
for Mr. Tabir.

03:47.314 --> 03:49.272
My uncle had to leave.

03:49.316 --> 03:51.796
He asked me to
drive you to his club.

03:51.840 --> 03:53.233
You can have
your meeting there.

04:10.685 --> 04:12.339
[man] Ms. McDowell,

04:12.382 --> 04:14.819
my uncle believes trust
is something you earn.

04:14.863 --> 04:17.474
He doesn'’t trust people
until he knows them

04:17.517 --> 04:18.562
very, very well.

04:21.435 --> 04:22.523
Why are we stopping?

04:22.566 --> 04:24.873
Relax, Canada.

04:27.267 --> 04:30.008
We are friends,
we are going to do business.

04:30.052 --> 04:31.314
Don'’t touch me.

04:31.358 --> 04:32.968
I'’m not asking.

04:33.011 --> 04:34.317
Do you know who I am?

04:34.361 --> 04:36.667
I know exactly who
you are, Hafiz.

04:37.755 --> 04:38.887
How do you know my name?

04:45.372 --> 04:47.548
[Jessica] The car was
swept an hour ago.

04:47.591 --> 04:51.116
Do not get out.
If you get out of this car,
I can'’t protect you.

04:51.160 --> 04:52.553
Who are you?

04:52.596 --> 04:53.597
-Let go off my arm please,
-Who are you?

04:53.641 --> 04:55.207
Now!

04:55.251 --> 04:57.993
Your uncle is in business
with Abu Domar Khan.

04:58.036 --> 05:00.343
Khan has made contact
with a terror organization

05:00.387 --> 05:02.650
via an aid agency
in Pakistan.

05:02.693 --> 05:05.305
They are seeking materials
to build a weapon.

05:05.348 --> 05:06.697
That'’s bullshit.

05:06.741 --> 05:09.439
Your brother is
in Kalutara jail
in Colombo

05:09.483 --> 05:11.441
facing execution
for trafficking.

05:11.485 --> 05:13.269
We can help him.

05:13.313 --> 05:17.404
We need information about your
uncle. Contacts. Shipments.

05:17.447 --> 05:19.754
If you help us,
we help you.

05:19.797 --> 05:22.844
If you don'’t,
your brother dies,

05:22.887 --> 05:26.456
and tomorrow you'’re sitting
next to your uncle
in a cell in Thailand,

05:26.500 --> 05:28.502
and it won'’t be me
asking the questions.

05:28.545 --> 05:29.938
No. No, you can'’t help him.

05:29.981 --> 05:31.940
We can help him, Hafiz.
Listen to me.

05:31.983 --> 05:33.985
Because I promise you one thing.

05:34.029 --> 05:37.337
Right now, you have no idea
what we can and cannot do.

05:39.339 --> 05:41.602
You'’ll get a call
at 8:00 AM.

05:41.645 --> 05:44.169
You'’ll be asked if
you need a cleaner.

05:44.213 --> 05:47.347
You want her to come
three mornings per week.
Do you understand?

05:50.262 --> 05:54.049
I said,
do you understand?

05:54.092 --> 05:56.051
[Gorrilaz'’s "I Am Happy"
playing in the background]

05:56.094 --> 06:00.795
Tonight I want to take
a few minutes to discuss
a grave threat to peace,

06:00.838 --> 06:04.102
and America'’s determination
to lead the world

06:04.146 --> 06:06.409
in confronting that threat.

06:06.453 --> 06:09.891
The decision has been made
to increase the threat condition

06:09.934 --> 06:13.851
designation currently classified
at Elevated Risk

06:13.895 --> 06:16.724
to increase that
threat condition designation

06:16.767 --> 06:19.422
to the High Risk category.

06:19.466 --> 06:21.250
[man] 9/11 and its aftermath

06:21.293 --> 06:24.427
awakened this nation to danger,

06:24.471 --> 06:28.692
to the true ambitions of
the global terror network.

06:28.736 --> 06:31.042
The state police are
investigating an Anthrax scare.

06:31.086 --> 06:33.349

a white substance.

06:40.051 --> 06:42.924
The Nuclear Regulatory
Commission has placed the
nation'’s nuclear plants

06:42.967 --> 06:44.578
on their highest
level of security.

06:44.621 --> 06:46.797
A terrorist attack
is now highly likely.

06:46.841 --> 06:49.234
[man] What do we know of
the September 11?

06:49.278 --> 06:51.585
We know that these
terrorist networks

06:51.628 --> 06:56.285
will use any means they can
to cause maximum death
and destruction.

06:56.328 --> 06:59.070
And we will take
whatever action is necessary

06:59.114 --> 07:01.725
to defend our freedom
and our security.

against targets

continue tonight.

And yet I'’m incredible in bed.

07:29.840 --> 07:32.713

07:32.756 --> 07:35.977
They are targeting
both Osama bin Laden'’s
training camps

07:36.020 --> 07:37.892
and Taliban military.

07:40.242 --> 07:42.679
[woman] Listen,
Steve and I are not going
on the same plane together.

07:42.723 --> 07:44.681
We'’re not even going
to take a train together.

07:44.725 --> 07:46.509
We took the train to your mom'’s.

07:46.553 --> 07:48.598
It only takes one to fly
into a nuclear power plant.

07:48.642 --> 07:49.904
-[man] Disney World.
-One.

07:49.947 --> 07:51.253
[man] A sarin attack
on Disney World.

07:51.296 --> 07:53.081
Yeah, but whatever
they'’re telling us,

07:53.124 --> 07:56.040
we'’re totally vulnerable.
I mean, who is protecting us?

07:56.084 --> 07:59.566
Would you take the risk of
taking your kids to Disney World
right now?

07:59.609 --> 08:01.132
Absolutely not.

08:01.176 --> 08:03.787
I'’d be terrified of
exposing my children

08:03.831 --> 08:06.311
to what adds up to
a clearing house
for crap merchandise

08:06.355 --> 08:08.270
and disappointing rides.

08:08.313 --> 08:11.534
Joe thinks Disney World
is Vegas for kids.

08:11.578 --> 08:14.102
So, Valerie, what do you do?

08:14.145 --> 08:17.148
I work in venture capital.

here in Georgetown.

08:17.192 --> 08:18.715

Exactly.

investment vehicles.

08:22.806 --> 08:23.938
It'’s actually pretty boring.

08:23.981 --> 08:25.113
You get on a plane.

they'’re sweating,

08:31.989 --> 08:35.340
they'’re sweaty, and they're
saying prayers.

08:35.384 --> 08:38.039
What do you do?
Steve, you have a kid, right?
You'’re off that plane.

08:38.082 --> 08:40.693
You'’re calling the cops.
if we'’re honest, we all are.
Joe?

08:40.736 --> 08:42.609
You know you are.

08:42.652 --> 08:44.174
I mean, come one, you see these
two guys on a plane.

08:44.219 --> 08:47.788
Turbans. Sweating. Prayers.
The whole thing.

08:47.831 --> 08:49.920
What do you say?
What'’s the call?

08:51.400 --> 08:52.444
Well, Jeff--

08:53.924 --> 08:55.360

08:55.404 --> 08:58.494
Yes, every time.
Every time we go out.

08:58.538 --> 09:01.802
He asked me a question,
I gave him a fully
considered response.

09:01.845 --> 09:04.413
He was drunk, Joe.
Everybody'’s had a hard day.

09:04.456 --> 09:06.110
They'’re just trying
to let off steam.

09:06.154 --> 09:08.852
By invoking quasi-racist
conundra? He'’s a parent.

09:08.896 --> 09:11.376
Is he teaching his four year old
to fear all men in turbans?

It'’s Diana's birthday.

09:13.857 --> 09:15.555
Jeff'’s her oldest friend.

09:15.598 --> 09:17.034
So?

No, it'’s not funny.
It'’s a very serious subject.

09:24.955 --> 09:27.479

someone spouts obnoxious crap

09:27.523 --> 09:29.481
makes you an asshole,
then I'’m an asshole.

when you married me.

here until after lunch.
Didn'’t I tell you?

Okay. I guess I will be
working at home this morning.

and documentation attached
that masks its point of origin.

12:52.162 --> 12:53.773
Sir, we'’re from US customs.

12:53.816 --> 12:55.600
Can I take a moment
of your time?

12:55.644 --> 12:57.864
Okay, sure.
Come on in.

13:31.506 --> 13:32.681
What the hell is that?

13:37.077 --> 13:38.426
[explosion]

13:41.777 --> 13:45.737
[man] A spark gap is a high
energy voltage-controlled
switching device.

13:45.781 --> 13:48.479
To detonate a nuclear bomb,
you need to be able to switch
high voltage,

13:48.523 --> 13:50.830
high current electrical
circuits at very high speeds

13:50.873 --> 13:53.571
to the nearest of
one hundredth of a nanosecond.

13:53.615 --> 13:56.444
The extremely short rise times
are achieved by discharging

13:56.487 --> 13:59.055
a low-induct,
high-voltage capacitor
through the spark gap

13:59.099 --> 14:01.275
and into the bridge wire
inside the warhead.

14:01.318 --> 14:04.844
The ballpark is five kilovolt
and one MF for the capacitor,

14:04.887 --> 14:07.977
with a peak current between
500 and a 1000 amperes.

14:09.413 --> 14:11.415
Does it have other uses?

14:11.459 --> 14:14.201
High speed photography,
industrial photo-chemistry.

14:14.244 --> 14:16.551
Zapping kidney stones.

14:16.594 --> 14:18.814
If your question is,
is someone out there

14:18.858 --> 14:23.732
building a fire train
to a nuclear device
component by component,

14:23.775 --> 14:26.604
you'’re talking one hell
of a complicated process.

14:26.648 --> 14:29.390
This guy is just
one tiny piece in the jigsaw.

14:29.433 --> 14:31.000
Here is a list of other
components exported

14:31.044 --> 14:33.263
through the same network
over the last three years.

14:33.307 --> 14:37.093
Tilt tables. Timing equipment.
High speed monitoring devices.

14:37.137 --> 14:38.965
Quartz rate sensors.

14:40.183 --> 14:41.532
Calibration units.

14:43.012 --> 14:44.971
It'’s not kidney stones.

14:47.277 --> 14:48.931
Thank God you stopped this.

14:48.975 --> 14:51.064
I'’m not stopping it.

14:51.107 --> 14:53.849
Okay, so we keep the transaction
live. Trace it all the way to
the end user.

14:53.893 --> 14:55.546
The shipment arrives in Joburg
on the 21st.

14:55.590 --> 14:57.809
It'’s put in
an unmarked container

14:57.853 --> 15:01.901
and shipped to the Jebel free
trade zone in Dubai. Here.

15:01.944 --> 15:05.556
Dr. Jonas and his team
at Los Alamos have altered
the impedance timings

15:05.600 --> 15:07.167
of the spark gaps by
a fraction of a nanosecond.

15:07.210 --> 15:10.126
Val, Chief wants to see you.

15:10.170 --> 15:11.475
I'’ll shut it down.

15:11.519 --> 15:13.956
Why? We have everything,
we are ready to go.

15:14.000 --> 15:16.089
We have actual intel
on the buyer.

15:16.132 --> 15:18.395
Sargin Vaziri,
Syrian National.

15:18.439 --> 15:20.310
Based out of Karachi.
On a wire picked up in Cairo,

15:20.354 --> 15:23.661
he talks about nuclear
componentry from a known
source in Pakistan.

15:23.705 --> 15:26.447
He'’s moving to
an unnamed Gulf state.

15:26.490 --> 15:28.014
It could be Iraq?

15:28.057 --> 15:29.624
Vaziri is devoutly Shia.

15:29.667 --> 15:31.191
Iraq is controlled
by Sunni.

15:31.234 --> 15:33.410
Saddam is Sunni.
There'’s no way this is Iraq.

15:33.454 --> 15:36.805
Seventh floor issued a directive
for a joint task force on Iraq.

15:36.848 --> 15:38.894
I want you to head up
operations.

15:38.938 --> 15:40.200
Congratulations,
Valerie.

15:40.243 --> 15:41.853
Thank you.

15:41.897 --> 15:44.030
You can pick your own team.
This is top priority.

15:44.073 --> 15:46.902
I need 24 hours to brief
my replacement.

15:49.687 --> 15:51.124
Shut it down.

15:51.167 --> 15:52.995
From Monday,
I need your both eyes on Iraq.

15:53.039 --> 15:54.779
Yes, sir.

15:54.823 --> 15:57.217
This is coming from
across the river.

15:57.260 --> 15:58.914
Down the line, DFU.

16:05.051 --> 16:06.704
"DFU"?

16:06.748 --> 16:08.445
Don'’t fuck up.

16:14.669 --> 16:15.931
Congratulations.

16:15.975 --> 16:17.367
Thanks.

16:21.763 --> 16:22.851
You can put it there.

16:29.075 --> 16:30.990
[music]

16:46.527 --> 16:47.310
Hey.

16:48.529 --> 16:49.878
Don'’t you have
a home to go to?

16:55.710 --> 16:57.538
I thought this went away.

16:57.581 --> 16:59.627
DIA released
the report Tuesday.

16:59.670 --> 17:01.585
WINPAC aren'’t buying
and State kicked it back,

17:01.629 --> 17:04.719
but it'’s still making waves
in the Vice President'’s office.

17:04.762 --> 17:06.068
You think Joe could do it?

17:09.680 --> 17:12.465
Well, he'’s qualified.

17:12.509 --> 17:14.207
He'’s been there
hundreds of times.

17:14.250 --> 17:16.078
He knows the arena
inside out.

17:16.122 --> 17:17.513
Great.

17:17.558 --> 17:19.299
Could you put his
credentials in a memo?

17:19.342 --> 17:21.040
I want to kick it
up the ladder.

17:22.606 --> 17:23.912
You don'’t look overjoyed.

17:26.219 --> 17:29.352
Joe'’s been working hard
to build his business.

17:29.396 --> 17:32.834
Then there'’s the twins. Money
is kind of tight right now.

17:32.877 --> 17:35.054
He'’s helped us before.

17:35.097 --> 17:36.620
Could you just
ask him to come in?

17:38.709 --> 17:41.147
[music]

17:54.725 --> 17:56.423
Hey, Joe?

17:56.466 --> 18:00.122
Hey. Nice place
you got here. Cozy.

18:00.166 --> 18:01.384
I need to get you cleared.

18:06.128 --> 18:07.782
You work
in the basement?

18:07.825 --> 18:10.393
Actually, I work in Georgetown
at Brewster Jennings.

18:10.437 --> 18:12.743
We'’re a small firm
of venture capitalists.

18:12.787 --> 18:14.615
Well, that must be
interesting work.

18:15.790 --> 18:16.791
It pays the rent.

18:16.834 --> 18:19.272
[silence]

18:28.194 --> 18:30.457
-[knocking on door]
-Come in.

18:30.500 --> 18:32.415
Joe, this is Jack.

18:32.459 --> 18:34.113
-Hi, Joe Wilson.
-Deputy Chief of CPD.

18:34.156 --> 18:35.505
It'’s a pleasure, Ambassador.

18:35.549 --> 18:37.116
-Hi, Joe Wilson.
-Ambassador.

18:37.159 --> 18:38.769
I'’ll leave you guys to it.

18:38.813 --> 18:39.596
-Joe Wilson.
-[man] Morning, Ambassador.

18:39.640 --> 18:41.468
How are you? Joe Wilson.

18:41.511 --> 18:42.817
Hello.

18:42.860 --> 18:44.906
Joe Wilson, hi.

18:44.949 --> 18:46.342
[Jack] Have a seat.

18:46.386 --> 18:48.431
Can I get you something
to drink?

18:48.475 --> 18:50.303
Coffee would be great,
thank you.

18:50.346 --> 18:52.087
[Jack] How do you like it?

18:52.131 --> 18:54.872
Just black, thanks.

18:54.916 --> 18:58.398
Ambassador Wilson, what do
you know about yellowcake?

18:58.441 --> 19:00.356
-Yellowcake uranium?
-Mm-hm.

19:00.400 --> 19:04.578
I believe it'’s a concentrate
made from uranium ore

19:04.621 --> 19:07.320
that'’s used in the fissile
material for weapons programs.

19:07.363 --> 19:08.712
But I'’m not a scientist.

19:08.756 --> 19:10.410
-Thank you.
-[Jack] What about Niger?

19:12.107 --> 19:13.717
I usually pronounce it Niger

19:13.761 --> 19:17.504
to avoid confusion with Nigeria.

19:17.547 --> 19:22.204
The UN Human Development Index
rates it the least livable
country in the world.

19:22.248 --> 19:24.511
I started
my Foreign Service there.

19:24.554 --> 19:27.514
I visited many times
as Ambassador to Gabon.

19:27.557 --> 19:29.211
And then, again,

19:29.255 --> 19:32.823
as Director of Africa Policy
for President Clinton,

19:32.867 --> 19:35.217
with the NSC.

19:35.261 --> 19:36.827
I'’ve often met with
Prime Minister Mayaki.

19:36.871 --> 19:38.699
I know the former
foreign minister.

19:38.742 --> 19:40.309
I know the Minister of Mines.
I know the country very well.

19:40.353 --> 19:42.877
The Office of the Vice President
has received a report

19:42.920 --> 19:44.487
concerning a memorandum of sale

19:44.531 --> 19:46.837
between the governments
of Niger and Iraq

19:46.881 --> 19:51.320
for the purchase of 500 tons
of yellowcake uranium ore.

19:51.364 --> 19:53.453
I don'’t have to tell you
how serious this allegation is.

19:53.496 --> 19:55.368
No, sir you don'’t.

19:55.411 --> 19:58.327
This is a request from
the vice president'’s office.

19:58.371 --> 19:59.633
Can you help us?

20:01.809 --> 20:03.158
What do you have in mind?

20:03.202 --> 20:05.900
[woman on P.A.
in foreign language]

20:09.860 --> 20:12.646
[suspenseful music]

20:25.180 --> 20:28.227
[people speaking
in foreign language]

21:18.886 --> 21:20.017
Hello.

21:20.061 --> 21:21.715
[speaking foreign language]

21:38.862 --> 21:42.388
How can Niger help
with his old friend,
America?

21:42.431 --> 21:44.433
In summer 2001,

21:44.477 --> 21:49.612
Iraq started to purchase
60,000 high alloy
7075 T-6 aluminum tubes

21:49.656 --> 21:51.310
manufactured in China.

21:51.353 --> 21:54.313
The high spec of these tubes
led us to conclude

21:54.356 --> 21:57.577
that they were intended
for the enrichment of uranium

21:57.620 --> 22:01.102
and, as such, provide proof
that Saddam is building
a nuclear bomb.

22:01.145 --> 22:06.237
In August 2001, Jay Turner,
that'’s me, flew to Vienna

22:06.281 --> 22:08.370
to meet with
the IAEA scientists.

22:08.414 --> 22:10.285
I produced this report,

22:10.329 --> 22:13.549
aspects of which represents
the CIA'’s present position.

22:13.593 --> 22:15.029
I'’m happy to take questions.

22:15.072 --> 22:16.944
[man] The INR concluded
late last year that

22:16.987 --> 22:19.468
these tubes are probably
for artillery use

22:19.512 --> 22:22.166
and the deal we agreed exactly
matched those used by Iraq

22:22.210 --> 22:24.734
-for artillery rockets.
-[man 2] Where are the tubes?

22:24.778 --> 22:26.432
WINPAC has them.

22:26.475 --> 22:29.870
We'’ve examined them
and this is my point.

22:29.913 --> 22:32.046
None of you guys
have even seen the tubes.

22:34.048 --> 22:35.223
I'’ve seen them.

22:36.529 --> 22:38.574
And, uh, when was that?

22:38.618 --> 22:41.534
When I led the covert team
that intercepted them in Jordan,

22:41.577 --> 22:45.842
brought back samples
and delivered them to you guys
that were in PAC.

22:45.886 --> 22:49.368
And I take it you'’re
not a nuclear expert.

22:50.456 --> 22:54.024
These tubes are a match

22:54.068 --> 22:55.896
for those designed
by German scientist,

22:55.939 --> 22:57.811
Gernot Zippe, in the 50s.

22:57.854 --> 23:02.381
You'’re right. I'm no nuclear
expert but Dr. Houston Wood,

23:02.424 --> 23:06.472
at the University of Virginia
atomic facility is.

23:06.515 --> 23:08.474
He also knows Dr. Zippe

23:08.517 --> 23:11.999
and he told him that the wall
thickness of the Iraqi tubes

23:12.042 --> 23:15.611
was three or four times
the thickness of his design.

23:15.655 --> 23:18.353
Right, and he also said
that the length of the tubes

23:18.397 --> 23:20.224
is twice that
of Zippe'’s design.

23:20.268 --> 23:23.445
In fact, he said that the only
thing that was similar between

23:23.489 --> 23:25.360
his tubes and
the aluminum tubes

23:25.404 --> 23:27.275
was that they were
both made of aluminum.

23:27.318 --> 23:32.585
A metal that hasn'’t been used
in gas centrifuges since 1952.

23:32.628 --> 23:34.848
I went to Vienna, okay?

23:34.891 --> 23:37.241
Canada, and I'’ve been working
on this for months.

23:37.285 --> 23:39.287
They'’re centrifuges, fact.

23:39.330 --> 23:41.332
Okay. So basically,

23:41.376 --> 23:43.160
they'’re your tubes

23:43.204 --> 23:45.380
and if we don'’t let you win
you'’re taking them home.

23:45.424 --> 23:46.642
[laughter]

23:46.686 --> 23:48.339
That'’s pathetic.

23:48.383 --> 23:50.298
[Valerie] Joe, no one'’s
saying you'’re wrong here,

23:50.341 --> 23:52.256
but if you'’re right,
it'’s huge.

23:52.300 --> 23:56.260
So, we ask
the question, right?

23:56.304 --> 23:58.262
We have to ask the question.

23:59.350 --> 24:01.962
[music]

24:05.705 --> 24:08.969
[Joe] Niger has two uranium
mines in the Sahara Desert.

24:09.012 --> 24:12.494
One'’s flooded, the other is run
by Kojima, a French subsidiary

24:12.538 --> 24:14.931
jointly controlled
by the Japanese and Germans.

24:14.975 --> 24:16.890
500 tons of yellowcake

24:16.933 --> 24:18.979
is not an off-the-books
size transaction.

24:19.022 --> 24:21.851
It represents a 40%
production increase

24:21.895 --> 24:24.201
in the nation'’s
annual output of uranium.

24:24.245 --> 24:28.423
A sale that size
would leave a huge paper trail.

24:28.467 --> 24:31.557
Any documentation would,
by law, have to be signed

24:31.600 --> 24:33.254
by the Prime Minister,

24:33.297 --> 24:35.778
Foreign Minister
and the Minister of Mines.

24:35.822 --> 24:38.085
But say it was an
off the books deal.

24:38.128 --> 24:40.957
How do you hide
the transportation of
500 tons of anything,

24:41.001 --> 24:43.482
let alone lightly
refined uranium?

24:43.525 --> 24:46.180
You'’re talking
50 semi-tractor trucks

24:46.223 --> 24:49.357
on one road through villages
where nothing passed for months

24:49.400 --> 24:51.185
except maybe one bush taxi.

24:51.228 --> 24:53.535
It would be the biggest
event for months.

24:53.579 --> 24:58.018
To say they forgot,
it'’s like kids
forgetting Christmas.

24:58.061 --> 25:00.194
You have the droughts
of the 70s and the 80s

25:00.237 --> 25:04.415
which brought millions
of dollars in US aid,
which continues today.

25:04.459 --> 25:06.026
It doesn'’t make any sense

25:06.069 --> 25:08.245
that the Nigerians
would compromise that life line.

25:08.289 --> 25:10.160
So, for that reason,

25:10.204 --> 25:13.250
for all the reasons
that I'’ve been telling you,

25:13.294 --> 25:16.602
it is my opinion that this sale
could not have happened.

25:20.606 --> 25:23.652
[Joe] So,
what happens next?

25:23.696 --> 25:27.177
Well, they write a report,
give it to the analysts,

25:27.221 --> 25:29.223
it'’ll be rewritten
then kicked upstairs

25:29.266 --> 25:32.052
and combined
with other reports they get.

25:32.095 --> 25:33.880
What?

25:33.923 --> 25:36.012
I just think it'’s ludicrous
that they'’re gonna send somebody

25:36.056 --> 25:39.189
all the way over there,
spend all that money
for the same conclusion.

25:39.233 --> 25:42.453
Well, you can'’t compile
intelligence from
a single source.

25:42.497 --> 25:45.326
That'’s not intelligence,
that'’s an opinion.

25:45.369 --> 25:48.024
Trust me, it'’s a fact.

25:48.068 --> 25:49.809
-[Valerie] Says who?
-[Joe] Says me.

25:49.852 --> 25:54.204
You'’re just a teeny-weeny
tiny cog in a giant machine.

25:54.248 --> 25:58.469
You did your job. You should
feel good, they count on that.

25:58.513 --> 25:59.688
That'’s why they don't pay you.

26:01.734 --> 26:04.084
I'’m not feeling very 007-ish.

26:06.434 --> 26:09.089
[Valerie] Maybe I can get the
kids to make a medal for you.

26:11.482 --> 26:14.964
Us 00s prefer
gratuitous sex.

26:24.887 --> 26:26.585
Maybe I can...

26:27.673 --> 26:28.978
do something
about that.

26:29.022 --> 26:30.458
Mmm!

26:30.501 --> 26:32.416
-[Valerie] Mm?
-Mm-hmm.

26:32.460 --> 26:33.722
[music]

26:33.766 --> 26:36.072
Bengal is holding
another round of bidding

26:36.116 --> 26:40.207
on their deepwater offshore
blocks at the end of the year.

26:40.250 --> 26:43.602
Chevron, Elf and Exxon
are interested.

26:43.645 --> 26:45.821
[music]

27:07.800 --> 27:10.367
[man speaks in foreign language]

27:17.940 --> 27:22.684
Okay. Buddy, you okay?
Four arms, four legs,
no broken bones.

27:22.728 --> 27:24.860
[Kim] Hey kids. Mr. Wilson,
I'’m so sorry I'm late.

27:24.904 --> 27:25.992
That'’s fine.
Look, guys, Kim'’s here.

27:26.035 --> 27:27.689
When is Mommy coming home?

27:27.733 --> 27:29.778
[continues in foreign language]

27:31.432 --> 27:34.740
[man] It'’s an honor
to meet you at last.

27:34.783 --> 27:38.961
I was unable to attend your
training seminar at MIT,

27:39.005 --> 27:42.008
but I read a transcript.

27:42.051 --> 27:45.576
Did you read my latest
paper on quarks?

27:45.620 --> 27:50.451
Dr. Harper, I cite your
1995 essay more than once.

27:52.409 --> 27:55.282
Dr. Harper'’s in
Cambridge, Massachusetts.

27:55.325 --> 27:57.632
She received a call yesterday

27:57.676 --> 28:00.635
requesting she stay home
for 48 hours.

28:01.723 --> 28:03.159
I don'’t understand.

28:06.075 --> 28:08.208
Who are you?

28:08.251 --> 28:10.776
I'’m sorry for misleading you,

28:10.819 --> 28:14.649
but I'’m here to ask
you the same question

28:14.693 --> 28:17.173
because you'’re not
Professor Baddoui.

28:17.217 --> 28:20.394
Your name is
Dr. Tarrif Al Falari.

28:20.437 --> 28:22.135
You were born in Basra.

28:22.178 --> 28:25.051
You were lead engineer at
the Osirak nuclear facility

28:25.094 --> 28:28.750
until you fled Iraq and
arrived here in Cairo.

28:28.794 --> 28:32.798
I need names of your colleagues
in the weapons programs.

28:32.841 --> 28:36.889
The lives of hundreds
of thousands of your people
may depend upon it.

28:36.932 --> 28:38.717
This is absurd!

28:38.760 --> 28:41.110
You were never
tortured... broken.

28:41.154 --> 28:45.201
You didn'’t finally escape
and arrive here in Cairo
with nothing.

28:47.551 --> 28:52.339
No, my name is Bahkrat Baddoui.

28:52.382 --> 28:55.951
I have never been to Basra.
I'’m a teacher.

29:00.042 --> 29:04.786
Dr. Falari had two daughters.

29:04.830 --> 29:08.747
They were taken by
Uday Hussein'’s private guard.

29:08.790 --> 29:10.531
They were never seen again.

29:23.283 --> 29:27.983
I need names of your colleagues
in the weapons programs.

29:28.027 --> 29:30.551
[background noise]

29:48.961 --> 29:51.398
[music]

30:05.107 --> 30:07.762
[Valerie] Why is the OVP here?

30:07.806 --> 30:09.198
What?

30:15.422 --> 30:16.466
[knocking]

30:16.510 --> 30:17.728
Yeah?

30:17.772 --> 30:19.687
The Vice President'’s men
are here.

30:19.730 --> 30:20.993
What?

30:23.865 --> 30:25.824
[man] My name is
Scooter Libby.

30:25.867 --> 30:29.436
I am the chief of staff
to the vice president.

30:30.524 --> 30:31.655
You are?

30:32.787 --> 30:34.049
Dave.

30:34.093 --> 30:37.792
I'’m... an analyst
in nonproliferation.

30:40.186 --> 30:43.885
What can you tell
the Vice President
about aluminum tubes?

30:43.929 --> 30:47.323
I didn'’t realize that
this is what we we'’re going
to be talking about here.

30:49.673 --> 30:52.285
Relax, will you? The Veep'’s
just dotting the "I"s.

30:52.328 --> 30:55.897
Oh, come on Jim. The only time
the Vice President comes
to Langley is to cut a ribbon.

30:55.941 --> 30:58.073
Cheney doesn'’t trust us.
This shit in the creek
goes back 30 years.

30:58.117 --> 30:59.727
It'’ll blow over.

30:59.770 --> 31:01.947
Hey, Val, where
are we on Iraq?

31:01.990 --> 31:05.820
We need to find sources
that we can rely on.

31:06.908 --> 31:08.867
We need to get in close.

31:08.910 --> 31:12.522
Jim, I think she can get us
inside the weapons program.

31:13.915 --> 31:15.090
How?

31:17.484 --> 31:19.921
In three weeks you'’ll
have to come back again.

31:19.965 --> 31:23.446
[background conversation]

31:30.105 --> 31:31.498
Come on.

31:33.152 --> 31:34.327
I said come on!

31:44.815 --> 31:47.906
[Valerie] Dr. Hassan, is there
somewhere we could talk?

31:49.908 --> 31:52.171
How long is it since
you saw your brother?

31:54.042 --> 31:55.914
1992.

31:55.957 --> 31:59.700
Before that, in '’83 he came here
for an engineering conference.

31:59.743 --> 32:02.007
Twice in 25 years.

32:02.050 --> 32:04.923
We tried to stay in contact.
It'’s difficult.

32:06.315 --> 32:08.448
Would you like to
go back and see him?

32:11.364 --> 32:13.888
You want me to become a spy?

32:13.932 --> 32:17.283
We need to ask Hammad
some questions.

32:17.326 --> 32:18.893
Do you think he'’d answer?

32:18.937 --> 32:22.505
I am a doctor. I work hard,
I'’m also a mother.

32:22.549 --> 32:25.508
I have a small daughter
and I'’m all she has.

32:25.552 --> 32:27.467
We could help
your brother.

32:27.510 --> 32:30.209
Right now he'’s extremely
valuable to us.

32:30.252 --> 32:31.601
And to Saddam.

32:31.645 --> 32:34.169
And Mukhbarat watch him
night and day.

32:35.910 --> 32:38.217
He could come here.

32:38.260 --> 32:41.611
He'’s an expert physicist.
He'’d have a job.

32:41.655 --> 32:44.484
His children and his
family would be safe.

32:44.527 --> 32:47.095
You and your daughter could
see him whenever you want.

32:48.444 --> 32:50.403
Can you help us?

32:50.446 --> 32:53.232
I will not do anything to help
you. I don'’t know you.

32:53.275 --> 32:55.234
If you care about Iraq,
about your country.

32:55.277 --> 32:57.192
My country is America now.

32:57.236 --> 32:59.281
Trust me. If there was
another way to do this.

32:59.325 --> 33:03.807
I don'’t trust you.
I don'’t trust you at all.

33:03.851 --> 33:05.331
Zahraa...

33:06.680 --> 33:08.725
we'’re going to war

33:08.769 --> 33:11.076
and your brother will be
right in the middle of it.

33:20.259 --> 33:22.739
[President Bush] If the Iraqi
regime wishes peace,

33:22.783 --> 33:26.787
it will immediately and
unconditionally forswear,

33:26.830 --> 33:29.224
disclose and remove or destroy

33:29.268 --> 33:31.226
all weapons of mass destruction.

33:31.270 --> 33:32.575
-[knocking]
-[Bill] Yeah, come in.

33:32.619 --> 33:35.013
They'’re back.

33:35.056 --> 33:38.886
[Bush] If Iraq'’s regime defies
us again, the world must move
deliberately,

33:38.929 --> 33:41.976
decisively to hold Iraq
to account.

33:45.849 --> 33:47.547
Don'’t make jokes.

33:54.467 --> 33:56.164
[gagging]

34:03.128 --> 34:05.956
He thinks I don'’t understand
how serious it is?

34:07.132 --> 34:09.003
Weeks and weeks of 15-hour days.

34:09.047 --> 34:13.746
We'’ve been back over
this and over this.

34:13.790 --> 34:18.056
All right. That'’s it.
I'’m going to handle this.

34:18.099 --> 34:21.188
We'’ve been over this data with
you, five, six times now

34:21.233 --> 34:24.409
and we don'’t know how you
want us to play this.

34:27.456 --> 34:30.068
Let me level with you, Paul.

34:30.110 --> 34:32.505
I don'’t know what
these tubes are for.

34:32.547 --> 34:34.550
There could be
something to this,

34:34.594 --> 34:37.248
from everything you'’re saying
but very likely not, right?

34:37.292 --> 34:38.380
Exactly.

34:38.424 --> 34:40.687
May I ask you a question?

34:40.730 --> 34:44.952
When you say we don'’t
really know how to play
this, what do you mean?

34:44.995 --> 34:46.822
I mean to say that I don'’t know
how to say it in any other way--

34:46.867 --> 34:49.043
Except you didn'’t say,
"I", you said, "We."

34:49.087 --> 34:51.871
So, you and the others
have discussed how to
play these briefings.

34:51.915 --> 34:54.788
Why does the CIA feel the need
to play these briefings?

34:54.831 --> 34:57.747
No, no. What I mean is--
Okay. Look, I didn'’t mean
what I just said.

34:57.791 --> 35:00.446
Which part? The last part?
Or other things too?

35:00.489 --> 35:02.143
I'’m sorry, I'm getting
a little confused.

35:02.187 --> 35:03.013
You want me to come back?

35:03.057 --> 35:04.667
No. God, no.

35:04.711 --> 35:07.192
You don'’t know why
I'’m here, do you?

35:07.235 --> 35:11.021
In 1991, the United
States invaded Iraq

35:11.065 --> 35:13.285
and after which weapons
inspectors discovered

35:13.328 --> 35:16.375
Saddam was six months
off enriching uranium

35:16.418 --> 35:20.640
to sufficiently high
specification to
make a nuclear bomb.

35:20.683 --> 35:27.342
He had fissile material, and
not a single person in the CIA

35:27.386 --> 35:31.694
had the slightest clue that
such a program even existed.

35:33.131 --> 35:36.786
So, now, one decade on,

35:36.830 --> 35:40.442
are you telling me
that you'’re 100% sure

35:40.486 --> 35:43.837
these tubes are not intended
to create nuclear weapons?

35:43.880 --> 35:46.709
One point about intelligence,
nothing is 100%.

35:46.753 --> 35:49.451
So what? Are you 99% sure? 98%?

35:49.495 --> 35:51.192
I'’m saying that you can't put
an exact figure out of it.

35:51.236 --> 35:53.542
I'’m saying that you
cannot-- Excuse me.

35:53.586 --> 35:55.327
You cannot be that precise.

35:55.370 --> 35:57.285
Could you say
that you'’re 97% sure?

35:57.329 --> 35:59.896
Is there'’s a three percent
chance you'’ve got this wrong?

36:00.984 --> 36:03.726
Or four or five?

36:03.770 --> 36:06.773
It'’s still pretty good odds.
Do you like those odds, Paul?

36:06.816 --> 36:10.559
You willing to put your name to
that? Ready to make that call?

36:10.603 --> 36:12.213
Actually, I don'’t make
that call.

36:12.257 --> 36:14.259
Yes, you do, Paul.

36:14.302 --> 36:17.436
Each time you interpret
a piece of data.

36:17.479 --> 36:20.656
Each time you choose
a "maybe" over a "perhaps",

36:20.700 --> 36:24.138
you make a call, a decision.

36:24.182 --> 36:26.923
Right now, you'’re making
a lot of little decisions

36:26.967 --> 36:29.448
adding up to a big decision,

36:29.491 --> 36:32.929
but what if there'’s only a
one percent chance you'’re wrong?

36:32.973 --> 36:35.236
Can you say for sure
that you'’ll take that chance

36:35.280 --> 36:37.151
and state, as a fact,

36:37.195 --> 36:39.414
that this equipment
is not intended

36:39.458 --> 36:42.156
for a nuclear weapons
program?

36:42.200 --> 36:47.683
Do you know what one percent
of the population
of this country is?

36:47.727 --> 36:52.340
It'’s 3,240,000 souls.

36:52.384 --> 36:55.300
Okay. Sir, look,
we'’re not machines,

36:55.343 --> 36:57.345
we look at the evidence,
we game it out.

36:57.389 --> 36:59.129
And, believe it or not,

36:59.173 --> 37:01.654
not everybody agrees all
the time. It'’s a process.

37:01.697 --> 37:03.177
-It'’s a process...
-Yes.

37:03.221 --> 37:04.483
...and not everyone agrees.

37:04.526 --> 37:06.006
Exactly.

37:07.703 --> 37:09.444
Who doesn'’t agree?

37:13.100 --> 37:15.842
[bugle plays "Taps"]

37:25.547 --> 37:28.289
What the heck is Joe Turner
doing next to the DCI?

37:28.333 --> 37:31.423
Didn'’t you hear? On Friday, the
DCI took him to the White House.

37:31.466 --> 37:34.600
He briefed the President
on aluminum tubes.

37:34.643 --> 37:36.254
You fucking kidding me.

37:38.386 --> 37:42.129
[man] Ready, aim, fire.

37:42.172 --> 37:44.784
[Bill] It'’s a dead end. So you
got a list of Iraqi scientists.

37:44.827 --> 37:46.525
How do you suggest
we get to them?

37:46.568 --> 37:49.223
The Mukhabarat watch the
scientists night and day there.

37:49.267 --> 37:51.051
Their houses are bugged,
their friends are followed.

37:51.094 --> 37:52.792
Send in a team of NOCs
by taxi from the north.

37:52.835 --> 37:54.489
Say you get through the
checkpoints and roadblocks.

37:54.533 --> 37:56.186
If you show up in my bedroom
in the dead of night

37:56.230 --> 37:57.753
asking me to help out Uncle Sam,

37:57.797 --> 37:59.277
I'’m going to react
unpredictably.

37:59.320 --> 38:01.627
Given the theater,
it'’s all too high-risk.

38:01.670 --> 38:03.803
Even if we get to them,
they won'’t come out alone.

38:03.846 --> 38:05.935
They'’ll want to bring
their family, their children,
their kids.

38:05.979 --> 38:08.329
We'’ll get down south to Basra,
we'’ll ask for Jordan's help.

38:08.373 --> 38:10.331
Give me two months.
I'’ll give you two or three.

38:10.375 --> 38:13.465
No, I have 29 names.
I need to get to them all.

38:13.508 --> 38:14.901
The wall'’s too high, Val.

38:14.944 --> 38:16.381
What do you want to do,
train a mouse?

38:16.424 --> 38:17.860
Maybe.

38:24.214 --> 38:28.218
[whispering] Hey.
Did I wake you?

38:28.262 --> 38:29.742
[sighs]

38:31.396 --> 38:33.441
Yeah, um...

38:33.485 --> 38:35.051
I have to go.

38:35.095 --> 38:37.837
I got to be at the airport
in 45 minutes.

38:37.880 --> 38:40.840
It'’s 3:45 in the morning.

38:40.883 --> 38:44.974
Look, I didn'’t want to wake you.

38:45.018 --> 38:47.020
Do we need childcare tomorrow?

38:47.063 --> 38:49.588
[Valerie] I left it
a Post-it on the fridge.

38:49.631 --> 38:50.937
It'’s all on the Post-it.

38:50.980 --> 38:52.634
Yeah, of course.
It'’s on the Post-it.

38:53.896 --> 38:55.681
Are you OK?

38:55.724 --> 38:56.682
[Joe sighs]

38:57.770 --> 39:01.687
I don'’t know where you go.

39:01.730 --> 39:04.211
Who you meet.

39:04.254 --> 39:06.561
If you'’re in jail somewhere.

39:06.605 --> 39:11.958
If you'’re in a ditch somewhere
in Jordan, Beirut.

39:14.569 --> 39:17.529
If you went missing,
I couldn'’t tell anybody

39:17.572 --> 39:19.313
because you were never there.

39:21.533 --> 39:23.752
I'’d never know
what happened to you.

39:35.024 --> 39:36.809
I don'’t know where you go.

39:39.942 --> 39:41.770
[sighs]

39:49.169 --> 39:50.779
I'’m going to Cleveland.

39:53.347 --> 39:55.131
I'’ll be home tonight.

40:02.487 --> 40:03.444
It'’s...

40:04.750 --> 40:06.578
It'’s on the Post-it.

40:13.323 --> 40:15.413
Have a good day.

40:54.103 --> 40:55.540
[man] You have two of
these in your luggage.

40:55.583 --> 40:57.063
This is the only pen
we want you to use.

40:57.106 --> 40:59.761
The ink on this pen is
visible for 10 seconds.

40:59.805 --> 41:02.416
Only when given
the correct chemical fixative
can it be read.

41:02.460 --> 41:04.505
If the Mukhabarat see any of
this they will do things to me

41:04.549 --> 41:06.376
that you cannot imagine.

41:06.420 --> 41:08.988
Tell me what you need to know.
I will memorize it.

41:09.031 --> 41:13.035
We have 50 very specific
questions, some extremely
technical.

41:13.079 --> 41:15.603
You have 206 bones in your body.

41:15.647 --> 41:19.694
Do you want their names
in English, Latin or Arabic?

41:25.265 --> 41:26.440
How do you feel?

41:35.101 --> 41:38.539
If anyone stops you,
if anyone asks you anything...

41:40.585 --> 41:42.108
stay calm.

41:42.151 --> 41:43.631
You'’re just visiting
your brother.

41:43.675 --> 41:44.806
Keep it simple.

41:44.850 --> 41:47.505
How do you do it?

41:47.548 --> 41:49.507
Lie to someone
to their face.

41:50.682 --> 41:52.118
Huh?

41:56.557 --> 41:59.299
You have to know.

41:59.342 --> 42:03.651
Know why you'’re lying and
never forget the truth.

42:06.959 --> 42:08.351
[knock]

42:11.529 --> 42:12.921
It'’s time.

[Condoleezza Rice on TV]
You will get different
estimates

43:34.089 --> 43:36.352
about precisely how
close he is.

43:36.396 --> 43:41.053
We do know that there have been
shipments going into Iraq,

43:41.096 --> 43:44.839
for instance, of aluminum tubes
that really are only suited

43:44.883 --> 43:46.841
for nuclear weapons programs,

43:46.885 --> 43:48.669
centrifuge programs.

43:48.713 --> 43:51.977
There will always
be some uncertainty

43:52.020 --> 43:55.197
about how quickly he can
acquire a nuclear weapon,

43:55.241 --> 43:58.331
but we don'’t want the smoking
gun to be a mushroom cloud.

43:58.374 --> 44:00.768
-Equipment he needs to be
able to enrich uranium.
-[Jack] It'’s a coordinated
leak.

44:00.812 --> 44:05.904
Somebody in the OBP leaked the
story to theNew York Times.

44:05.947 --> 44:08.036
Smoking gun, mushroom clouds.

44:08.080 --> 44:09.777
They'’re using the same words.

44:09.821 --> 44:12.562
-It'’s a coordinated leak.
-I'’m coming home.

44:12.606 --> 44:13.868
[Dick Cheney on TV] We have
been able to intercept and
prevent him from acquiring,

44:13.912 --> 44:16.523
through this particular
channel,

44:16.566 --> 44:19.787
the kinds of tubes
that are necessary
to build a centrifuge.

I always roll up the window.

44:23.225 --> 44:24.705
[Valerie]
Yeah, but you can smell it.

44:24.749 --> 44:26.794
What would you have me do,
roll up a towel

44:26.838 --> 44:29.884
and hide in a room like
a teenager smoking
or sand bag my study?

44:29.928 --> 44:31.146
Just go out on the deck.

44:31.190 --> 44:33.192
It'’s minus-10 degrees outside.

44:33.235 --> 44:36.412

You'’re missing the whole point.

outside in a goose down,

44:47.423 --> 44:48.773
So, don'’t think Churchill.

44:48.816 --> 44:50.600
Think Scott of the Antarctic.

44:52.211 --> 44:54.213
All right.
I quit.

44:54.256 --> 44:56.781
Can I ask a dumb question?
What is an aluminum tube?

44:56.824 --> 45:00.654
It'’s a centrifuge
to make uranium.

45:00.698 --> 45:03.918
[overlapping chatter]

45:03.962 --> 45:06.051
They do know what they'’re for.
Come on.

45:06.094 --> 45:07.835
Have you read about this,
Valerie?

45:07.879 --> 45:10.446
Oh, I was away last week
on business.

45:10.490 --> 45:13.536
Basically, Saddam bought these
tubes and we nailed him.

45:13.580 --> 45:15.713
I mean, we have them and
they'’re packed with uranium.

45:15.756 --> 45:17.584
They'’re packed with uranium?

45:17.627 --> 45:19.238
-They'’re packed with uranium!
-Jet packed with uranium!

45:19.281 --> 45:21.762
-My expert husband.
-Right.

45:21.806 --> 45:23.982
So they'’re for purifying,
but the bomb comes later.

45:24.025 --> 45:27.028
Basically, you boil it up and
you make the big one, right?

45:27.072 --> 45:29.378
No. Says who?
It'’s a bunch of tubes, Jeff.

45:29.422 --> 45:31.685
[Jeff] Everything you read
in The New York Times,
you'’re right.

45:31.729 --> 45:33.600
[Steve] Joe, you know
about this stuff.
What'’s your hunch on this?

45:33.643 --> 45:36.037
I don'’t know anything about
tubes. I'’m not qualified.

45:36.081 --> 45:38.257
-I think the question--
-It'’s a pretext.

45:38.300 --> 45:41.521
I mean, 50% of Americans think
Saddam blew up the towers.

45:41.564 --> 45:43.523
[Jeff] I agree with that.
-[woman] You can'’t say
that he'’s not a threat.

in the 30s.

45:48.746 --> 45:50.965
He'’s not Hitler. I'm sorry.
He'’s not a Hitler.

45:51.009 --> 45:53.054
-He'’s Saddam.
We put him there.
-[woman] He'’s evil.

45:53.098 --> 45:56.405
Why? He'’s our fault!
He always was.
He'’s not a threat.

45:56.449 --> 45:59.408
Have you met him, Fred?
Have you met Saddam?

45:59.452 --> 46:02.281
Has Saddam looked you
in the eye and threatened you?

46:03.804 --> 46:05.327
Has he threatened to kill you?

46:07.025 --> 46:08.461
You don'’t know what
you'’re talking about.

46:13.031 --> 46:17.209
Well, I think that'’s
probably true.

46:17.252 --> 46:19.167
I'’m guilty of part of that.

a separate point.

to go elsewhere.

no politics at the table.

going on over there.

What questions?

49:33.753 --> 49:36.538
How close is your
program to a warhead?

49:36.582 --> 49:38.584
When and where is the
first test scheduled?

49:38.627 --> 49:41.543
How much 235-grade
uranium do you have?

49:41.587 --> 49:43.806
Identify other scientists
of the program.

49:43.850 --> 49:46.418
Who in the military
controls the program?

Which...

49:52.946 --> 49:54.513
What, Hammad?

49:54.556 --> 49:57.037
The program was completely
destroyed in the '’90s.

49:57.081 --> 49:59.909
The Americans destroyed
it and they know this.

50:01.520 --> 50:02.825
What else?

50:04.305 --> 50:07.961
How advanced is
the centrifuge facility?

50:08.005 --> 50:11.051
Which method are you using
to separate fissile isotopes?

50:11.095 --> 50:12.966
This is insane.

50:13.010 --> 50:16.143

to keep a tank on the road.

which develops fertilizer
and they know.

You need to see this.

We need to get Jack
to see this and Bill.

the last American official

50:44.737 --> 50:46.739
to meet with Saddam Hussein.

50:46.782 --> 50:50.264
It was 1990, and it was
a pretty scary time.

50:50.308 --> 50:52.919
Saddam had threatened
that he was going to execute

50:52.962 --> 50:57.010
anybody sheltering people
he called foreigners.

50:57.054 --> 50:58.794
Ambassador Wilson called
a press conference

50:58.838 --> 51:01.580
and appeared with a noose
around his neck

51:01.623 --> 51:04.452
and he said, the press reports,

51:04.496 --> 51:06.106
"If the choice
is to allow Americans

51:06.150 --> 51:09.892
to be taken as hostages
or to be executed,

51:09.936 --> 51:11.894
I'’ll bring my own fucking rope."

51:13.461 --> 51:15.420
Saddam backed down

51:15.463 --> 51:18.814
and Ambassador Wilson helped
get thousands safely home.

51:18.858 --> 51:21.078
When he himself came home
to the United States,

51:21.121 --> 51:23.776
he was warmly greeted
by our President

51:23.819 --> 51:25.604
who took him to
the Oval Office

51:25.647 --> 51:30.696
and introduced him to the war
cabinet as an American hero.

51:30.739 --> 51:33.568
That'’s not quite right,
it was the Roosevelt Room

threat to national security?

with 500 nuclear scientists

51:45.493 --> 51:46.973
at the South factory.

51:47.016 --> 51:50.063
In '’91 it was blanket
boomed by B52s.

51:50.107 --> 51:52.326
Hussain Kamal kept
the scientists together,

51:52.370 --> 51:54.415
threatening to kill them
if they tried to leave.

51:54.459 --> 51:56.548
But sanctions destroyed
the economy

51:56.591 --> 51:58.898
and when Kamal was
executed in '’95,

51:58.941 --> 52:00.987
the team just
drifted apart.

the same thing.

all saying the same thing.

52:10.475 --> 52:13.695

took a great risk.

52:13.739 --> 52:15.175
To bring us what?

52:15.219 --> 52:16.568
I could have saved us
the airfare.

52:16.611 --> 52:18.918
The White House is
getting stoved-piped.

52:18.961 --> 52:23.531
Someone is cherry-picking
raw data and serving it
up to the press as fact.

52:23.575 --> 52:26.317
Then they look to us
to confirm it.
It'’s bullshit.

52:26.360 --> 52:28.580
[Joe] One of Saddam'’s
ministers asked him

52:28.623 --> 52:31.452
why he had executed
a certain official

52:31.496 --> 52:34.499
who had been
a loyal supporter.

52:34.542 --> 52:39.025
Saddam said, "I would rather
kill my friends in error

52:40.505 --> 52:44.030
than to allow my enemies
to live."

52:44.073 --> 52:46.772
For me, that'’s the
mark of a monster.

-Two shots espresso coffee.

-Black coffee.
-[Bush] ...biological weapons.

-of 30,000 munitions capable
of delivering chemical agents.
-Thank you.

53:38.824 --> 53:40.826
From three Iraqi defectors,
we know that Iraq

53:40.869 --> 53:45.309
in the late 1990'’s had several
global biological weapons labs.

53:49.356 --> 53:53.926
Saddam Hussein had
an advanced nuclear weapons
development program...

53:55.536 --> 53:58.539
had a design for
a nuclear weapon,

53:58.583 --> 54:00.628
and was working
on five different methods

54:00.672 --> 54:02.630
of enriching uranium
for a bomb.

54:04.502 --> 54:06.547
The British government has
learned Saddam Hussein

54:06.591 --> 54:10.682
recently sought
significant quantities
of uranium from Africa.

54:13.206 --> 54:15.382

tell us that he'’s attempted

54:15.426 --> 54:17.645
to purchase high strength
aluminum tubes

nuclear weapons production.

We seek peace,

55:18.315 --> 55:21.274
[man 2 reporting ]
...missiles and bunker buster
bombs from F117s...

55:21.318 --> 55:22.928
were aimed at Iraq'’s piers.

57:32.710 --> 57:34.842
[Valerie] Bill, wait up.

57:34.886 --> 57:37.410
Every team is combing
the desert looking for WMD.

57:37.454 --> 57:39.194
-I can'’t.
-All I need is
a couple of units--

57:39.238 --> 57:41.283
We don'’t have
the resources, Val.

57:41.327 --> 57:43.590
-I need to get these
families and any men--
-Listen to me. Will you listen?

57:43.634 --> 57:45.592
-Let'’s say we extract
these guys, okay?
-Come on, Bill!

57:45.636 --> 57:48.247
We bring them home
and put them on CNN,

57:48.290 --> 57:50.336
what do you think they'’re going
to tell us that the White House
wants to hear, huh?

57:50.379 --> 57:52.947
"Thank you. Oh, and by the way,
there was no nuclear program.

57:52.991 --> 57:57.517
There is no WMD.
P.S. You all knew that."

57:57.561 --> 58:00.346
Think about it.
You want me to go to DCI, ask
him to sign off his own funeral?

58:00.389 --> 58:02.000
Bill, I gave my word.

58:02.043 --> 58:04.524
That'’s not my problem.
I got bigger problems.

58:11.444 --> 58:14.012
It'’s like if there was a baby
on the ledge up on seventh,

58:14.055 --> 58:16.797
no one would get up
and save it in case
the White House wanted it there.

58:16.841 --> 58:18.582
Bill'’s right.

58:18.625 --> 58:21.193
This is just one snafu in 1,000
that we have right now.

58:21.236 --> 58:24.370
-These scientists are not--
-These scientists are the WMD.

58:24.413 --> 58:26.720
If we can'’t protect them,

58:26.764 --> 58:28.809
they'’ll run straight to
the first country who can
and they'’ll put them to work.

58:37.688 --> 58:39.298
I never said this.

58:39.341 --> 58:41.300
If anyone ever asks,
I'’ll deny all knowledge.

58:44.303 --> 58:45.957
How quietly can you do this?

01:00:11.085 --> 01:00:13.522
[Hammad] I need to know
my family will be safe.

01:00:13.566 --> 01:00:15.655
My wife, my children
we'’re all in danger.

01:00:15.699 --> 01:00:18.092
[Valerie] Hammad, I know that.

01:00:18.136 --> 01:00:21.748
We'’ll take care of your family,
but we have to move fast, okay?

01:00:21.792 --> 01:00:23.445
How do I know
I can trust you?

01:00:23.489 --> 01:00:27.667
Hammad, listen to me.
Do exactly as I say.

01:00:27.711 --> 01:00:28.886
We won'’t let you down.

01:00:28.929 --> 01:00:32.629
[Val continues indistinctly]

01:00:32.672 --> 01:00:37.721
[man reporting] US military has
reported the death of another
five US soldiers on Wednesday.

01:00:37.764 --> 01:00:41.812
One soldier died
after being struck by a bomb
while on foot patrol.

01:00:41.855 --> 01:00:43.770
Reported killed
across the country.

01:00:43.814 --> 01:00:47.382
Official Iraqi figures
show that 966...

01:00:47.426 --> 01:00:51.386
[Bush] The British government
has learned that
Saddam Hussein recent--

01:00:51.430 --> 01:00:57.131
--significant quantities
of uranium--
from Africa.

01:00:57.175 --> 01:01:00.004
The British government has
learned that Saddam Hussein
recently sought

01:01:00.047 --> 01:01:04.138
significant quantities
of uranium from Africa.

01:01:04.182 --> 01:01:08.360
Listen, Pete, I want to ask you
something. It'’s very important.

01:01:08.403 --> 01:01:10.710
Is it possible that
the President is referring

01:01:10.754 --> 01:01:13.931
to another African country,
not Niger?

01:01:13.974 --> 01:01:16.107
I'’ve seen the INR.
It'’s Niger.

01:01:16.150 --> 01:01:19.327
He'’s referring specifically
to yellowcake from Niger. Why?

01:01:23.288 --> 01:01:24.898
I'’m the source.
I went to Niger.

01:01:24.942 --> 01:01:27.292
It'’s wrong.
It'’s not true.

01:01:28.423 --> 01:01:29.773
I see.

01:01:31.905 --> 01:01:33.951
What exactly are you
proposing to do?

01:01:35.692 --> 01:01:37.476
I don'’t know what
I'’m going to do.

01:01:37.519 --> 01:01:40.348
You want my advice?
Do nothing.

01:01:40.392 --> 01:01:44.788
You already did your job.
You did your best, you came
home, end of story.

01:01:44.831 --> 01:01:48.530
We'’re talking about Niger,
yellowcake from Niger.

01:01:48.574 --> 01:01:52.056
Look, I don'’t have to go
all the way to Africa to know
something'’s messed up here.

01:01:52.099 --> 01:01:54.101
Three months and
what have we found?

01:01:54.145 --> 01:01:57.757
No centrifuges, no yellowcake,
no bio, no WMDs.

01:01:57.801 --> 01:02:00.020
You think something'’s up here?
Join the line.

01:02:00.064 --> 01:02:02.066
It stretches all the way from
State to the Pentagon and back.

01:02:02.109 --> 01:02:03.937
So why hasn'’t anybody
stepped forward?

01:02:03.981 --> 01:02:06.200
Why you think, Joe?

01:02:06.244 --> 01:02:08.594
We went to war.

01:02:08.637 --> 01:02:09.638
Listen,

01:02:09.682 --> 01:02:11.249
as your friend now,

01:02:12.337 --> 01:02:15.209
just be smart.

01:02:15.253 --> 01:02:17.603
You have a wife and a family.

01:02:17.646 --> 01:02:20.649
We'’re talking about the
President of the United States.

01:02:20.693 --> 01:02:22.390
The White House.

01:02:22.434 --> 01:02:25.089
Now go take a long look in
the mirror and say that again.

01:02:41.235 --> 01:02:42.976
What'’s wrong?

01:02:43.020 --> 01:02:44.325
Nothing.

01:02:46.588 --> 01:02:47.633
I'’m just tired.

01:02:47.676 --> 01:02:49.722
Are the kids asleep?

01:02:49.766 --> 01:02:51.506
Yeah, they'’re asleep.

01:02:51.550 --> 01:02:53.117
Okay, good.

01:02:55.380 --> 01:02:56.903
I'’m going to go up.

01:03:04.171 --> 01:03:07.566
[Bush] There are some
who feel like the conditions

01:03:07.609 --> 01:03:10.308
are such that they can
attack us there.

01:03:10.351 --> 01:03:12.310
My answer is, bring them on.

01:03:12.353 --> 01:03:14.051
We'’ve got the force necessary

01:03:14.094 --> 01:03:16.705
to deal with
the security situation.

01:04:00.532 --> 01:04:02.534
[reporters'’ questions
overlapping]

01:04:02.577 --> 01:04:06.364
There'’s zero, nada,
nothing new here.

01:04:06.407 --> 01:04:09.193
I think the President'’s
statement at the State of
the Union goes much broader

01:04:09.236 --> 01:04:10.716
than the Niger question.

01:04:10.759 --> 01:04:13.414
Is the President'’s
statement correct?

01:04:13.458 --> 01:04:18.028
Yes. I see nothing that goes
broader that would indicate

01:04:18.071 --> 01:04:21.074
there was no basis for the
President'’s broader statement.

01:04:21.118 --> 01:04:25.035
But, specifically
on the yellowcake,
the yellowcake from Niger,

01:04:25.078 --> 01:04:28.777
we have acknowledged that
that did, in fact, turn out
to be a forgery.

01:04:28.821 --> 01:04:30.910
-[man] You believe
the British report is true.
-Oh, shit.

01:04:30.954 --> 01:04:33.391
-I'’m sorry?
-The British report.

01:04:35.741 --> 01:04:39.745
-Mark, clear my morning.
-It was wrong, then?

01:04:39.788 --> 01:04:42.052
Let me do this, David.

01:04:42.095 --> 01:04:44.445
On David'’s specific question,

01:04:44.489 --> 01:04:47.927
I'’m going to come back
to you on that.

01:04:47.971 --> 01:04:49.233
Fleischer plowed the briefing.

01:04:49.276 --> 01:04:50.669
I saw.

01:04:50.712 --> 01:04:52.410
CBS knows yellowcake
was pulled from Cincinnati

01:04:52.453 --> 01:04:54.716
ten weeks ago
at the CIA'’s request.

01:04:54.760 --> 01:04:56.805
They also had that Gerson
wrote both speeches.

01:04:56.849 --> 01:04:58.982
Karl is looking for you.
He'’s unhappy.

01:04:59.025 --> 01:05:02.333
I want a transcript
of everything across
network, blogs, and print

01:05:02.376 --> 01:05:05.814
citing Ambassador Wilson,
Niger or yellowcake.

01:05:05.858 --> 01:05:09.122
Tell Karl I'’ll be in my office
straight after I'’m done.

01:05:14.127 --> 01:05:16.129
The 5th US Circuit Court
of Appeals...

01:05:16.173 --> 01:05:18.392
This has become a trust issue
for the President,

01:05:18.436 --> 01:05:20.264
we can'’t get behind on this.

01:05:22.266 --> 01:05:23.615
We need to change the story.

01:05:24.833 --> 01:05:26.574
Who is Joe Wilson?

01:05:35.366 --> 01:05:36.976
David.

01:05:37.020 --> 01:05:38.586
If someone works at the CIA

01:05:38.630 --> 01:05:41.067
and they sent their spouse
on a trip,

01:05:41.111 --> 01:05:43.374
would there be a paper trail?

01:05:43.417 --> 01:05:47.160
Well, any such request
would require approval
from the chain of command.

01:05:49.032 --> 01:05:51.469
From the requestor right up
to the Director of Operations,

01:05:51.512 --> 01:05:55.690
but yes, paperwork would
normally be generated.

01:05:55.734 --> 01:05:59.172
Okay.

01:05:59.216 --> 01:06:02.784
Does the President have the
power to declassify information?

01:06:21.978 --> 01:06:24.545
-Valerie?
-What?

01:06:28.723 --> 01:06:32.945
"The CIA'’s decision
to send retired diplomat
Joseph C. Wilson to Africa"--

01:06:32.989 --> 01:06:34.468
Further down.

01:06:40.344 --> 01:06:43.825
"Wilson never worked
for the CIA but his wife,
Valerie Plame"--

01:06:43.869 --> 01:06:46.219
"Is an agency operative on
weapons of mass destruction."

01:06:46.263 --> 01:06:47.873
He just went ahead and did it.

01:06:47.916 --> 01:06:50.354
Does this run overseas?

01:06:50.397 --> 01:06:52.704
It'’s in the newspaper, Valerie.
It'’s on the net, it's...

01:06:52.747 --> 01:06:56.403
-No, Novak'’s column.
Is he syndicated overseas?
-It'’s everywhere.

-I'’ve already started a list.
-Good.

01:07:41.274 --> 01:07:43.972
We need to get an idea, fast,
of how much this thing bleeds.

a list, then come back here.

-Why is Internal Security here?
-To help us.

this damage assessment.

I have to get word to them.

I don'’t know what you're
talking about.

Jack, they'’re
packed and ready to go.

01:09:39.175 --> 01:09:40.828
You know what this means.

-Sorry. I got to go.
-[man] Ms. Plame.

Take a walk.

01:09:58.411 --> 01:10:02.589
As of this morning,
all CPD operations involving you
have been suspended.

01:10:02.633 --> 01:10:05.113
Effective immediately, you'’re
to have no further contact

to investigate
the Italian report."

01:11:23.104 --> 01:11:26.325
This comes from
the Vice President, the Chief
of Staff or a top advisor.

01:11:26.369 --> 01:11:27.805
-[children] Mom!
-I got to go.

01:11:27.848 --> 01:11:29.546
-Look at my picture.
-I will.

01:11:29.589 --> 01:11:32.157
[girl] Trevor won'’t let me
borrow his Power Ranger.

01:11:32.200 --> 01:11:34.333
[Trevor] Mommy!

01:11:34.377 --> 01:11:36.727
-[Valerie] Did you say please?
-I said please.

01:11:36.770 --> 01:11:39.947
There'’s a 1982 act
that says it'’s a crime
for a government official

01:11:39.991 --> 01:11:42.994
to knowingly disclose
a covert agent.

01:11:43.037 --> 01:11:47.041
It comes with a $50,000 fine
and/or up to 10 years in jail.

01:11:47.085 --> 01:11:49.392
-[telephone rings]
-Don'’t answer the phone. Do not.

01:11:49.435 --> 01:11:51.307
Who have you spoken--
Joe? Please, don'’t.

01:11:51.350 --> 01:11:53.526
-She is.
-Joe? Joe?

01:11:53.570 --> 01:11:55.311
I'’m sorry, honey.
Are you okay?

01:11:55.354 --> 01:11:56.747
She'’s right here.

01:11:58.009 --> 01:11:59.271
It'’s Lisa.

01:12:02.622 --> 01:12:04.102
-Hello?
-Okay, guys.

01:12:04.145 --> 01:12:05.451
Valerie, your name
is in the paper.

01:12:05.495 --> 01:12:07.801
It says you'’re
a CIA agent.

01:12:07.845 --> 01:12:09.890
Look, I can'’t talk right now.

01:12:09.934 --> 01:12:12.371
Well, I can'’t make a comment.

01:12:12.415 --> 01:12:17.507
Look, I'’m going to call you
back tomorrow, okay?
I'’m really sorry.

01:12:17.550 --> 01:12:20.248
-Oh, my God.
-Shit.

01:12:20.292 --> 01:12:22.076
It'’s got to be true.

01:12:28.344 --> 01:12:32.130
Your mom called.
Your uncle and Janey in Chicago.

01:12:32.173 --> 01:12:34.088
I wrote it down there for you.

01:12:34.132 --> 01:12:37.614
And Andrea Mitchell called.

01:12:37.657 --> 01:12:40.138
She said White House
sources say

01:12:40.181 --> 01:12:43.402
the real story is not
the 16 words,

01:12:43.446 --> 01:12:45.361
but Joe Wilson and his wife.

01:12:45.404 --> 01:12:48.102
Did I care to comment?

01:12:48.146 --> 01:12:50.583
Well, I damn well do
care to comment

01:12:50.627 --> 01:12:54.370
and she'’s asked me on the show
the day after tomorrow.

01:12:54.413 --> 01:12:56.546
No.

01:12:56.589 --> 01:12:59.026
You'’re not going on TV, Joe.

01:13:05.990 --> 01:13:07.339
Thank you.

01:13:09.907 --> 01:13:13.301
[Joe] This was clearly designed
as a shot across the bow

01:13:13.345 --> 01:13:15.434
for those who might
step forward,

01:13:15.478 --> 01:13:19.220
those unnamed analysts who said
that pressure was put on them

01:13:19.264 --> 01:13:21.919
by the White House, for example,
would think twice

01:13:21.962 --> 01:13:27.011
about having their own
family'’s name dragged
through this particular mud.

01:13:36.063 --> 01:13:37.804
[Valerie] I didn'’t prepare
for this moment.

01:13:39.240 --> 01:13:41.895
I had no plan
for this day.

01:13:41.939 --> 01:13:43.680
When did you join?

01:13:43.723 --> 01:13:46.813
'’85, straight out of college.

01:13:46.857 --> 01:13:48.598
Wow, that'’s--

01:13:48.641 --> 01:13:51.818
-Eighteen years.
-So, did they find you, or...?

01:13:51.862 --> 01:13:54.342
No, I approached them.

01:13:54.386 --> 01:13:56.823
And did Joe know?

01:13:56.867 --> 01:13:58.695
Yes.

01:13:58.738 --> 01:14:00.436
Your parents?

01:14:00.479 --> 01:14:02.655
Yes, but that'’s all.

01:14:05.136 --> 01:14:09.923
So you have lovers all over
the world? Do you have a gun?

01:14:09.967 --> 01:14:12.056
Have you killed people?

01:14:13.536 --> 01:14:15.581
I can'’t...

01:14:16.930 --> 01:14:18.541
I can'’t tell you
anything.

01:14:21.500 --> 01:14:23.284
You can'’t tell me anything.

01:14:25.461 --> 01:14:29.465
God. We always said Val
was such a great listener,

01:14:29.508 --> 01:14:32.859
asks a lot of questions
about work and the kids.

01:14:34.557 --> 01:14:37.385
So selfless.

01:14:37.429 --> 01:14:41.085
-Diana--
-Do you remember when
I first met Steve

01:14:41.128 --> 01:14:44.175
and I didn'’t trust lawyers

01:14:44.218 --> 01:14:48.005
and do you remember
what you said to me?

01:14:48.048 --> 01:14:52.488
You said that you worked
with them all the time and
that they weren'’t so bad.

01:14:54.054 --> 01:14:55.969
And I married him,

01:14:56.013 --> 01:14:58.232
he'’s the father
of my children.

01:15:05.805 --> 01:15:07.503
[background noise]

01:15:25.346 --> 01:15:27.000
[man] Did your wife
send you to Niger?

01:15:27.044 --> 01:15:29.829
I was not sent by my wife, but
the issue is not who sent me,

01:15:29.873 --> 01:15:31.701
it'’s whether or not
a crime was committed.

01:15:31.744 --> 01:15:33.354
[telephone rings]

01:15:33.398 --> 01:15:35.008
[girl laughs] I'’m going
to get it!

01:15:35.052 --> 01:15:37.097
[Trevor] I'’m going to get it.
I got it.

01:15:37.141 --> 01:15:38.534
Hello?

01:15:40.448 --> 01:15:41.928
Hello?

01:15:41.972 --> 01:15:43.713
[woman] Your husband
is a communist.

01:15:43.756 --> 01:15:45.758
I hope you die,
you commie whore.

01:15:45.802 --> 01:15:47.847
-We know where you live.
-Who is this?

01:15:47.891 --> 01:15:49.980
-[girl] Trevor.
-Who--

01:15:50.023 --> 01:15:51.677
-[line disconnects]
-[girl] Help me on.

01:15:51.721 --> 01:15:53.200
[boy] Beat it.

01:15:56.508 --> 01:15:58.597
Mommy, Trevor won'’t let me
go on his tractor.

01:15:58.641 --> 01:16:01.121
Okay, so find
something else to play.

01:16:01.165 --> 01:16:02.949
I don'’t...

01:16:02.993 --> 01:16:06.605
Mommy? Mommy?

01:16:06.649 --> 01:16:08.912
What? What?

01:16:10.870 --> 01:16:13.351
[phone rings]

01:16:18.138 --> 01:16:22.099
"He stayed inside
for more than two weeks.

01:16:22.142 --> 01:16:24.536
-Then he nibbled--"
-[knocking on door]

01:16:40.683 --> 01:16:42.119
Zahraa?

01:16:42.162 --> 01:16:44.251
Hammad has disappeared.

01:16:44.295 --> 01:16:47.211
His wife, his children
are missing.

01:16:47.254 --> 01:16:50.344
My uncle in Mansour, he said
they were targeting them,

01:16:50.388 --> 01:16:52.608
-they were killing them.
-Who?

01:16:52.651 --> 01:16:56.481
Hammad'’s colleagues. Dr. Habbuk
was shot dead in the street,

01:16:56.524 --> 01:16:59.049
Dr. Falli was murdered
in his hallway.

01:16:59.092 --> 01:17:00.398
Listen, Zahraa--

01:17:00.441 --> 01:17:02.226
I know you can'’t tell me
where he is,

01:17:02.269 --> 01:17:04.750
just tell me you have him.
Please, I beg you.

01:17:04.794 --> 01:17:07.231
I don'’t need to know anything,
just tell me he'’s safe.

01:17:11.757 --> 01:17:13.324
We don'’t have him.

01:17:16.719 --> 01:17:20.200
You said he would be safe.

01:17:20.244 --> 01:17:22.986
You said, "We would help you,
I promise."

01:17:23.029 --> 01:17:24.988
I trusted you.

01:17:30.036 --> 01:17:34.127
The Justice Department needed
to establish whether those in
the highest office

01:17:34.171 --> 01:17:39.306
sought to destroy the career
of a public servant to punish me
for telling the truth.

01:17:39.350 --> 01:17:42.570
-What'’s going on?
-What are you doing here?

01:17:52.276 --> 01:17:56.280
Falli, Habbuk.
Who else?

01:17:56.323 --> 01:17:58.325
I don'’t know what you're
talking about.

01:17:58.369 --> 01:18:00.763
Don'’t bullshit me,
who else is dead?

01:18:00.806 --> 01:18:04.462
You were right, it was all
about the scientists.

01:18:04.505 --> 01:18:06.203
We made a call.

01:18:06.246 --> 01:18:09.815
-A call?
-We passed your case files
to liaison.

01:18:09.859 --> 01:18:11.556
The Mossad were already
on the same page,

01:18:11.599 --> 01:18:13.689
they'’ve been hunting these guys
down since the invasion.

01:18:13.732 --> 01:18:16.126
You'’ll drive them underground,
they'’ll run straight to Iran,
Pakistan.

01:18:16.169 --> 01:18:17.736
Valerie, it'’s not
your problem.

01:18:17.780 --> 01:18:21.697
-How can you sleep at night?
-I sleep just fine.

01:18:21.740 --> 01:18:24.743
Now, Carol'’s mother is here.
I'’m sorry, but I'm going to have
to ask you to leave.

01:18:24.787 --> 01:18:29.530
It'’s called
counterproliferation, Jack.
Counter.

01:18:31.750 --> 01:18:34.840
Linda, are you still here?
It'’s late.

01:19:09.570 --> 01:19:12.269
[applause]

01:19:12.312 --> 01:19:15.533
At the end of the day,
it'’s of keen interest to me

01:19:15.576 --> 01:19:21.234
whether or not we see Karl Rove
frog-marched out of
the White House in handcuffs.

01:19:21.278 --> 01:19:24.716
And believe me, when I use that
name, I measure my words.

01:19:32.768 --> 01:19:34.813
[women calling] Mr. Wilson.

01:19:34.857 --> 01:19:37.381
-Excuse me. Hello.
-We came all the way from
Portland for this.

01:19:37.424 --> 01:19:38.817
Okay.

01:19:38.861 --> 01:19:41.211
My wife and I have never
sought publicity,

01:19:41.254 --> 01:19:44.910
but I know when I tell
her about all of the support
out here today,

01:19:44.954 --> 01:19:46.912
she'’ll be
thrilled and humbled.

01:19:46.956 --> 01:19:48.566
[phone rings]

01:19:52.048 --> 01:19:54.354
-Hello?
-Valerie, turn on MSNBC.

01:19:54.398 --> 01:19:57.009
-[Trevor] Mom, why can'’t
I have some juice?
-Okay. Hold on one second.

01:19:57.053 --> 01:20:00.970
They'’ve launched
an investigation,
Ashcroft just announced it.

01:20:01.013 --> 01:20:02.841
They say he'’s going
to convene a grand jury.

01:20:02.885 --> 01:20:05.104
Hold on a second.

01:20:05.148 --> 01:20:07.977
...that the FBI
now is conducting
a criminal investigation

01:20:08.020 --> 01:20:11.850
into who leaked the name of
the CIA undercover operative...

01:20:11.894 --> 01:20:14.200
I'’m going to be back later.

01:20:14.244 --> 01:20:16.376
I'’ve got to go over to Fox,
they want me to comment
on the investigation.

01:20:16.420 --> 01:20:19.118
-Joe, just hold on.
-Valerie, we'’ve got
to fight this.

01:20:19.162 --> 01:20:20.598
We cannot...
We'’ve got to push back.

01:20:20.641 --> 01:20:23.035
[girl] Mom, where'’s my doll?

01:20:23.079 --> 01:20:24.863
-[cell phone beeps]
-I'’ve got another call.

01:20:24.907 --> 01:20:25.864
-I got to go.
-Joe--

01:20:28.736 --> 01:20:30.303
Joe Wilson.

01:20:30.347 --> 01:20:31.870
[Chris Mathews]
Joe, it'’s Chris Matthews.

01:20:31.914 --> 01:20:34.351
I just spoke to Karl Rove,
he told me,

01:20:34.394 --> 01:20:37.093
"Wilson'’s wife is fair game."

01:20:47.886 --> 01:20:50.106
[Jim] Thank you for coming here.

01:20:50.149 --> 01:20:53.587
I wanted to convey my outrage
to you in person.

01:20:53.631 --> 01:20:57.548
I know it'’s not easy
but I want you to know how much
the agency appreciates

01:20:57.591 --> 01:20:59.898
your silence
in the light of this matter.

01:20:59.942 --> 01:21:04.511
We can'’t afford to have this
knife fight go on any longer.

01:21:06.035 --> 01:21:08.298
I get death threats every day.

01:21:08.341 --> 01:21:10.953
People threaten to kill
my husband, hurt my children.

01:21:10.996 --> 01:21:15.435
I went to the agency
and I requested security
to protect my family.

01:21:15.479 --> 01:21:20.397
I was declined because
"my circumstances fall
outside budget protocols".

01:21:21.920 --> 01:21:23.313
If this is a knife fight, sir,

01:21:23.356 --> 01:21:25.706
right now we'’re
fighting it alone.

01:21:28.927 --> 01:21:31.190
Joe Wilson versus
the White House, huh?

01:21:31.234 --> 01:21:33.801
Well, all I can say
is good luck.

01:21:33.845 --> 01:21:37.805
But I feel, as a friend,
I should tell you that
those men, those few men

01:21:37.849 --> 01:21:40.112
in that building over there,

01:21:40.156 --> 01:21:43.899
are the most powerful men
in the history of the world.

01:21:43.942 --> 01:21:47.206
How much of a stretch do you
think it would be for them to
take on Joe Wilson?

01:21:49.992 --> 01:21:52.211
Joe is out there on his own,
Valerie,

01:21:52.255 --> 01:21:54.822
but I know we can trust you.

01:21:54.866 --> 01:21:57.129
Speak to your husband.

01:22:02.830 --> 01:22:04.658
Tucker Carlson says,

01:22:04.702 --> 01:22:07.444
"Wilson'’s wife sent
him on a boondoggle

01:22:07.487 --> 01:22:09.794
because he needed the work."

01:22:09.837 --> 01:22:11.927
Who needs to work for free?

01:22:11.970 --> 01:22:16.366
It'’s not like Niger
is renowned for its fine dining
and celebrated operas,

01:22:16.409 --> 01:22:18.150
it reminds me of Paris.

01:22:20.892 --> 01:22:23.373
Listen, someone from
Vanity Faircalled,

01:22:23.416 --> 01:22:24.852
they want to do a piece.

01:22:24.896 --> 01:22:26.854
They want to do a
full-scale interview,

01:22:26.898 --> 01:22:29.596
photographs,
tell the whole story.

01:22:29.640 --> 01:22:31.511
What do you think about that?

01:22:33.165 --> 01:22:34.862
What do I think?

01:22:37.039 --> 01:22:40.651
Do I want my photograph
in Vanity Fair,
is that the question?

01:22:40.694 --> 01:22:42.827
Valerie, this is our chance.

01:22:42.870 --> 01:22:44.307
To do what?

01:22:44.350 --> 01:22:46.396
To tell our side of the story.

01:22:46.439 --> 01:22:51.488
It'’ll mean a dozen, maybe 50 TV
appearances, we have to do that.

01:22:51.531 --> 01:22:55.318
They'’re killing us on Fox,
in the blogs,
they'’re drowning us out.

01:22:55.361 --> 01:22:56.623
We'’ve got to strike back.

01:22:59.583 --> 01:23:02.238
What? What'’s wrong?
What did I say?

01:23:02.281 --> 01:23:06.111
Don'’t you get it, Joe? I mean,
where does all this stop?

01:23:08.070 --> 01:23:11.334
Our address is on the Internet,
a photo of our house.

01:23:11.377 --> 01:23:14.337
I changed our phone number,
what, five times now?

01:23:14.380 --> 01:23:16.295
My name, my name is everywhere,

01:23:16.339 --> 01:23:18.297
my real name, Joe.

01:23:18.341 --> 01:23:22.171
Where does all this tough-talk
and publicity and noise

01:23:22.214 --> 01:23:24.173
and all this bullshit
that you'’re doing,

01:23:24.216 --> 01:23:25.652
where does it get us?
Where?

01:23:25.696 --> 01:23:28.612
Andy Card told
the Financial Times

01:23:28.655 --> 01:23:31.832
that they are rolling
earthmovers over Joe Wilson."

01:23:31.876 --> 01:23:33.704
Quote: earthmovers!

01:23:33.747 --> 01:23:36.881
Well, I'’m sorry, you're not
going to get me without a fight.

01:23:36.924 --> 01:23:39.362
Not without one hell of a fight.

01:23:39.405 --> 01:23:42.104
It'’s the White House, Joe.
It'’s the White House.

01:23:42.147 --> 01:23:44.758
Do you seriously think
you can pick a fight with
the White House and win?

01:23:44.802 --> 01:23:46.630
-They'’ll bury us.
-They'’ll bury us if we don't!

01:23:46.673 --> 01:23:48.762
Joe Wilson.
Joe Wilson.

01:23:48.806 --> 01:23:50.503
Don'’t, Valerie!
Valerie!

01:23:50.547 --> 01:23:54.029
Does that make me right
if I shout louder than you?

01:23:54.072 --> 01:23:56.466
If I shout louder than you,
am I right?

01:23:56.509 --> 01:24:00.122
If I'’m the White House
and I shout a million times
louder than you,

01:24:00.165 --> 01:24:02.167
does that make me right?

01:24:02.211 --> 01:24:04.300
They lied, Valerie.

01:24:04.343 --> 01:24:06.780
They lied.
That'’s the truth.

01:24:07.868 --> 01:24:10.480
Truth. Right.

01:24:10.523 --> 01:24:12.917
-Well, by the time
they'’re finished with us...
-[girl, faintly] Mom!

01:24:12.960 --> 01:24:15.485
...we won'’t know what that is.

01:24:21.665 --> 01:24:23.971
[playing military march]

01:24:40.118 --> 01:24:41.424
Is Scooter home?

01:24:49.388 --> 01:24:52.609
-What'’s that?
-The Senate just finished
its investigation.

01:24:52.652 --> 01:24:56.047
The findings of the Select
Committee on Intelligence,
all 511 pages.

01:24:57.135 --> 01:24:58.658
Check out page 39.

01:25:05.361 --> 01:25:07.406
-Hi, Daddy!
-Who'’s the prettiest?

01:25:07.450 --> 01:25:08.494
Hey there, monster.

01:25:08.538 --> 01:25:10.453
How are you?

01:25:10.496 --> 01:25:13.499
Go get there. Get some play in
before it starts to rain.

01:25:15.806 --> 01:25:17.634
[Valerie] What'’s that?

01:25:17.677 --> 01:25:20.158
That'’s the Senate Select
Committee Intelligence report.

01:25:21.333 --> 01:25:23.292
On page 39, it says,

01:25:23.335 --> 01:25:26.947
"The former ambassador'’s
wife offered up his name."

01:25:26.991 --> 01:25:31.169
It then includes
a memorandum written by
Valerie Plame which says,

01:25:31.213 --> 01:25:34.041
"My husband has good relations
with both the Prime Minister

01:25:34.085 --> 01:25:35.782
and the former
Minister of Mines,

01:25:35.826 --> 01:25:38.394
both of whom could shed light
on this sort of activity."

01:25:38.437 --> 01:25:40.874
This is exactly what
I'’ve been denying.

01:25:40.918 --> 01:25:43.747
-No.
-Every newspaper,
every television, radio,

01:25:43.790 --> 01:25:45.618
-anybody that
would listen to me...
-Joe--

01:25:45.662 --> 01:25:48.186
...saying my wife did not
send me on a junket.

01:25:48.230 --> 01:25:50.928
-I didn'’t send you.
I didn'’t have that power.
-You sent an email.

01:25:50.971 --> 01:25:53.278
-The SSCI found the email.
-I write hundreds of emails.

01:25:53.322 --> 01:25:55.933
Why didn'’t you tell me?
It never occurred to
you, in all this time,

01:25:55.976 --> 01:25:58.240
-that this would be important?
-I didn'’t make the decision,

01:25:58.283 --> 01:26:00.067
I was asked to write
a recommendation.

01:26:00.111 --> 01:26:02.896
What was I supposed to do? Not
say my husband knows about this?

01:26:02.940 --> 01:26:05.334
Well, they have this now.

01:26:05.377 --> 01:26:08.075
They'’ll call me a liar
and it will stick

01:26:08.119 --> 01:26:09.251
because they have
all the power.

01:26:09.294 --> 01:26:10.817
What do I have?
My word.

01:26:12.254 --> 01:26:13.733
You'’ve got to speak up,
Valerie.

01:26:13.777 --> 01:26:16.171
You'’ve got to go
on the record now.

01:26:16.214 --> 01:26:18.042
You'’ve got to defend us. Now.

01:26:20.479 --> 01:26:22.133
So what do you want me to do?

01:26:22.177 --> 01:26:23.613
Go to the papers like you did?

01:26:23.656 --> 01:26:25.919
Write a piece in
The New York Times?

01:26:25.963 --> 01:26:27.443
You know I'’d have to
submit it to the Agency,

01:26:27.486 --> 01:26:28.835
-I'’ll have to--
-Wait, wait, wait.

01:26:28.879 --> 01:26:30.359
Honey, go play.
Go on, go on.

01:26:30.402 --> 01:26:32.317
The Agency?

01:26:32.361 --> 01:26:35.277
Valerie, who'’s your loyalty to,
to your husband or the CIA?

01:26:35.320 --> 01:26:38.671
It'’s to my family,
I put my family first, always.

01:26:38.715 --> 01:26:41.544
Were you putting them first when
you wrote that goddamn article?

01:26:42.632 --> 01:26:44.242
[Trevor] Mommy!

01:26:44.286 --> 01:26:49.508
Trevor, go find Samantha.

01:26:49.552 --> 01:26:52.990
I'’m taking different
routes to and from school.

01:26:53.033 --> 01:26:54.600
I'’m looking in empty rooms,

01:26:54.644 --> 01:26:57.081
under beds,
every time I come home.

01:26:57.124 --> 01:26:59.214
A home we'’re going to lose
pretty soon because your work

01:26:59.257 --> 01:27:02.217
has dried up and your clients
are running for cover.

01:27:02.260 --> 01:27:04.436
What has all this achieved, Joe?

01:27:10.355 --> 01:27:11.574
Maybe you'’re right.

01:27:13.619 --> 01:27:17.144
Maybe I just should have
kept my mouth shut.

01:27:17.188 --> 01:27:20.452
Is that what your dad
taught you, Valerie?

01:27:20.496 --> 01:27:22.106
Is that what Colonel
Sam Plame would say?

01:27:22.149 --> 01:27:23.760
A good American just
keeps his mouth shut.

01:27:23.803 --> 01:27:26.284
A good American just
looks the other way?

01:27:27.633 --> 01:27:30.114
Did you send me to Niger?

01:27:30.157 --> 01:27:32.464
"His business is struggling,
he'’s on the slide.

01:27:32.508 --> 01:27:34.858
I'’ll pull a few strings,
send the old man a bone."

01:27:34.901 --> 01:27:36.207
Is that pretty much
what happened?

01:27:36.251 --> 01:27:39.210
-How dare you?
-Did you send me?

01:27:39.254 --> 01:27:41.778
You think I'’m lying to you.

01:27:41.821 --> 01:27:43.083
Could I tell if you were?

01:27:49.133 --> 01:27:51.091
Trevor? Honey?

01:27:57.359 --> 01:27:58.708
Come on, Sam.

01:27:58.751 --> 01:28:00.927
Let'’s get in the car.

01:28:00.971 --> 01:28:03.278
-Bye, guys.
I'’ll see you at home.
-Bye, Daddy.

01:28:03.321 --> 01:28:06.106
-Bye.
-I'’m taking my car, okay?

01:28:08.152 --> 01:28:10.676
Joe Wilson was
a shameless self-promoter.

01:28:10.720 --> 01:28:14.811
Everything about his story
was either a lie or a hoax
or he was incompetent.

01:28:14.854 --> 01:28:17.553
I think this is important.
If we'’re in time of war

01:28:17.596 --> 01:28:19.685
and you want to know what
the President said or what
the President didn'’t say,

01:28:19.729 --> 01:28:22.122
whether it'’s accurate or not
and you have someone who says,

01:28:22.166 --> 01:28:24.386
"I'’m sent over there
by the Vice President
of the United States

01:28:24.429 --> 01:28:27.040
and George Tenet to
investigate this,"
and instead it turns out

01:28:27.084 --> 01:28:30.435
he was sent over
at the recommendation
of his wife...

01:28:30.479 --> 01:28:33.003
-[man 1] There he is.
-[man 2] Is it him?

01:28:33.046 --> 01:28:35.614
This is private property,
you'’re trespassing.

01:28:35.658 --> 01:28:37.747
Mr. Wilson,
did the Vice President--

01:28:37.790 --> 01:28:39.966
You still maintain
the Vice President'’s
office sent you to Niger

01:28:40.010 --> 01:28:42.186
-and not your wife?
-Please, get off my property.
I have no comment.

01:28:42.229 --> 01:28:45.145
[woman] Mr. Wilson, was
the Niger trip a free holiday?
A boondoggle?

01:28:45.189 --> 01:28:46.799
Have you been lying
to us from the start?

01:28:46.843 --> 01:28:49.106
I never lied.
I didn'’t receive any payment,

01:28:49.149 --> 01:28:51.369
my wife didn'’t send me.
Now, leave.

01:28:51.413 --> 01:28:53.415
-All of you, leave.
-Did the taxpayers pay
for your vacation, Mr. Wilson?

01:28:53.458 --> 01:28:55.068
It wasn'’t a vacation.
It was--

01:28:55.112 --> 01:28:56.853
[man 2] Are you against
our troops, Mr. Wilson?

01:28:56.896 --> 01:28:58.681
It was a fact-finding mission in
the leadup to a war. What? What?

01:28:58.724 --> 01:29:01.379
-Are you against our troops?
-All the way off the property.

01:29:01.423 --> 01:29:04.774
[woman] Mr. Wilson, people are
saying that your wife doesn'’t
actually work for the CIA.

01:29:04.817 --> 01:29:07.080
Is it true
she'’s just a secretary?

01:29:07.124 --> 01:29:09.822
[man 2] Mr. Wilson, is it true
that you donated money
to the Kerry campaign?

01:29:09.866 --> 01:29:12.172
[woman] Mr. Wilson,
your wife'’s a nobody.

01:29:12.216 --> 01:29:13.739
Well, I think it'’s really
all about the money.

01:29:13.783 --> 01:29:16.046
We'’re talking about
a third-rate CIA agent

01:29:16.089 --> 01:29:19.223
who had a government salary
and now she'’s out.

01:29:19.266 --> 01:29:21.747
She could have transferred
somewhere else within the CIA,

01:29:21.791 --> 01:29:24.446
she didn'’t have to leave.
Probably the CIA
wanted her to leave

01:29:24.489 --> 01:29:28.275
because she had already
been in the press without
their permission.

01:29:28.319 --> 01:29:32.715
It'’s come out that
she was considered kind of
a mediocre agent at best.

01:29:50.210 --> 01:29:52.082
Can I just take this pillow?

01:30:00.569 --> 01:30:03.267
When we were at the Farm,

01:30:03.310 --> 01:30:05.400
training to be field officers,

01:30:07.837 --> 01:30:12.363
they picked out four or five of
us and told us we'’d stood out.

01:30:12.407 --> 01:30:15.975
We were bound, hooded,
thrown into separate cells.

01:30:19.762 --> 01:30:24.549
They deprived us of sleep,
beat us.

01:30:24.593 --> 01:30:27.813
All we had to do was give up
the name of one of the others.

01:30:29.598 --> 01:30:31.730
Just one name.

01:30:34.516 --> 01:30:37.519
They push you until
they find it,

01:30:39.738 --> 01:30:41.784
until they find the point
at which you break.

01:30:43.960 --> 01:30:48.051
And one by one,
everybody broke...

01:30:49.879 --> 01:30:51.358
except me.

01:30:52.969 --> 01:30:55.319
And that made me feel special.

01:30:57.930 --> 01:30:59.497
"You can'’t break me.

01:31:02.326 --> 01:31:04.937
I don'’t have a breaking point."

01:31:10.900 --> 01:31:12.031
I was wrong.

01:31:53.377 --> 01:31:55.597
I'’m going to walk down
the stairs because
I can'’t run down them.

01:31:55.640 --> 01:31:58.991
Then you go safely but
let'’s go, quickly.

01:31:59.035 --> 01:32:01.690
Don'’t forget your jacket.
Trevor.

01:32:01.733 --> 01:32:03.605
Okay, say goodbye
to your father.

01:32:03.648 --> 01:32:05.345
Hey, guys.

01:32:05.389 --> 01:32:06.825
We'’re going on
a mystery tour.

01:32:06.869 --> 01:32:08.566
I know you are.

01:32:08.610 --> 01:32:11.526
Come here. I'’m going to
see you both real soon.

01:32:12.962 --> 01:32:14.964
Why won'’t you come, Daddy?

01:32:15.007 --> 01:32:17.140
Later. I'’m going
to see you really soon.

01:32:17.183 --> 01:32:18.924
Let'’s get in the car, guys.

01:32:20.578 --> 01:32:21.710
You got it.

01:32:29.674 --> 01:32:31.676
Okay, come on.
Let'’s go, guys.

01:32:31.720 --> 01:32:33.330
I'’m getting wet.

01:32:40.642 --> 01:32:42.513
[Trevor] No. I'’m getting soaked.

01:32:57.093 --> 01:32:58.355
[Sam] Grandma!

01:32:58.398 --> 01:33:02.446
Baby, how are you?

01:33:02.489 --> 01:33:05.362
Hey, Trevor, my goodness,
how big you are.

01:33:09.671 --> 01:33:11.760
Okay, do you want a red
one or a green one?

01:33:11.803 --> 01:33:14.023
-[Sam] Red one.
-[Trevor] Red one.

01:33:14.066 --> 01:33:15.633
[Grandma] Red one?

01:33:15.677 --> 01:33:18.157
Tomatoes.
Apples.

01:33:18.201 --> 01:33:20.029
And caramels, I think.

01:33:20.072 --> 01:33:22.466
So what color of apple
do you want?

01:33:22.509 --> 01:33:24.033
-[Trevor] Red.
-[Samantha] Green.

01:33:24.076 --> 01:33:26.557
You want a green.
Oh, good. I'’m glad.

01:33:47.491 --> 01:33:50.015
[sobs]

01:33:55.455 --> 01:33:58.241
[woman reporting]
Afghanistan can quickly
revert back to what it was.

01:33:58.284 --> 01:34:00.547
Not because there aren'’t
good people here but because--

01:34:00.591 --> 01:34:03.463
The governments of Niger and
Burkina Faso are interested

01:34:03.507 --> 01:34:06.205
in exploiting gold reserves
along their common border.

01:34:06.249 --> 01:34:10.732
-There'’s not a lot of interest
as gold is at 150 an ounce.
-[gunfire on TV]

01:34:10.775 --> 01:34:13.822
But it will compliment
your holdings East Africa
and the concession'’s cheap.

01:34:15.737 --> 01:34:17.826
Hello, my friend.

01:34:17.869 --> 01:34:19.784
[both speak in foreign language]

01:34:21.046 --> 01:34:23.135
-Joe Wilson.
-Kamalea...

01:34:23.179 --> 01:34:24.615
-Such a pleasure.
-Nice to meet you.

01:34:24.659 --> 01:34:26.095
How is your wife,
Joe?

01:34:26.138 --> 01:34:28.140
She'’s fine.
She'’s, well she's...

01:34:28.184 --> 01:34:31.187
Excuse me. Can I just--
A Black Eye:

01:34:31.230 --> 01:34:34.016
two shot of espresso,
strong coffee.

01:34:34.059 --> 01:34:35.321
I'’m not very hungry.

01:34:36.801 --> 01:34:37.976
How long are you in town?

01:34:38.020 --> 01:34:39.586
Just a few days.

01:34:39.630 --> 01:34:40.979
Kamalea and I are excited
to hear your proposal.

01:34:50.641 --> 01:34:51.990
Can I help you?

01:34:52.034 --> 01:34:53.731
Excuse me.
Can I help you?

01:34:53.775 --> 01:34:55.733
No. I was just telling these men
that you, sir, are a fraud.

01:34:55.777 --> 01:34:57.517
This is a private lunch.
Could you leave now, please?
Thank you.

01:34:57.561 --> 01:34:59.302
-This man is a liar
and a traitor.
-Excuse me.

01:34:59.345 --> 01:35:00.912
He is in the pay of
left wing hate groups.

01:35:00.956 --> 01:35:03.567
He is a Democrat stooge and
is an anti-war zealot.

01:35:03.610 --> 01:35:05.308
He has stabbed our
troops in the back.

01:35:05.351 --> 01:35:07.527
Leave now. Excuse me.
I am very sorry.

01:35:07.571 --> 01:35:10.792
You got blood on your hands
and your wife is a traitor
and a fantasist.

01:35:10.835 --> 01:35:13.185
Leave my table.
How dare you talk about my wife.

01:35:13.229 --> 01:35:14.839
You don'’t know her,
you don'’t know me.

01:35:14.883 --> 01:35:16.536
Now, leave now.

01:35:16.580 --> 01:35:18.669
Very nice.
You gentlemen should know

01:35:18.713 --> 01:35:20.279
-you'’re having lunch
with a traitor.
-I think we should go.

01:35:20.323 --> 01:35:21.890
-Oh, please don'’t, please--
-No, we should.

01:35:29.811 --> 01:35:31.334
Taxi.

01:35:33.466 --> 01:35:34.685
Palisades.

01:35:39.603 --> 01:35:40.778
You okay?

01:35:40.822 --> 01:35:42.084
I'’m fine.

01:35:44.782 --> 01:35:47.959
You'’re him. I see you on TV,
you'’re Joe Wilson.

01:35:48.003 --> 01:35:49.221
No, I'’m not.

01:35:49.265 --> 01:35:51.049
Yes, brother,
I see you on TV.

01:35:51.093 --> 01:35:52.224
It'’s somebody else.

01:35:52.268 --> 01:35:54.749
No, no.
I know you.

01:35:54.792 --> 01:35:56.098
My name is Joe too.

01:35:56.141 --> 01:35:58.317
I'’m from Sierra Leone,
Freetown.

01:35:58.361 --> 01:36:00.842
You'’ve been there, right?
Did you like Freetown?

01:36:00.885 --> 01:36:03.583
Joe, you and I both know
Freetown is a shithole.

01:36:03.627 --> 01:36:05.063
That'’s the truth.

01:36:05.107 --> 01:36:07.152
That'’s the truth right
there, brother.

01:36:07.196 --> 01:36:09.589
Yes, indeed,
Sierra Leone is dying.

01:36:09.633 --> 01:36:13.071
There'’s too much injustice and
corruption in Sierra Leone.

01:36:13.115 --> 01:36:15.334
People at the top
have too much power,

01:36:15.378 --> 01:36:17.293
way too much power.

01:36:17.336 --> 01:36:19.121
But people can'’t see
that from over here.

01:36:19.164 --> 01:36:21.688
Over here in America
it'’s a different world.

01:36:23.081 --> 01:36:24.300
I wouldn'’t be so sure of that.

01:36:24.343 --> 01:36:25.823
How can you say that?

01:36:25.867 --> 01:36:27.520
Land of the free, brother.
Home of the brave.

01:36:27.564 --> 01:36:29.609
Joe, could you pull over?

01:36:29.653 --> 01:36:32.047
I'’m just going to... Pull over
here, I'’m going to walk.

01:36:40.316 --> 01:36:41.534
Keep the change.

01:36:54.721 --> 01:36:55.984
That'’s cheating.

01:36:56.027 --> 01:36:58.856
I got it.

01:36:58.900 --> 01:37:02.294
Done.

01:37:02.338 --> 01:37:03.426
Above your head.

01:37:04.514 --> 01:37:05.471
Move your rope.

01:37:05.515 --> 01:37:06.951
How is he?

01:37:06.995 --> 01:37:08.605
Oh, he is okay.

01:37:08.648 --> 01:37:09.954
He'’s better.

01:37:09.998 --> 01:37:11.738
Shaking through.

01:37:20.138 --> 01:37:21.748
[Trevor] I win!

01:37:27.798 --> 01:37:29.321
There.
There they are.

01:37:29.365 --> 01:37:30.888
You see those guys, those
little yellow fellers?

01:37:30.932 --> 01:37:32.150
Yeah, I see them.

01:37:32.194 --> 01:37:33.238
See that?

01:37:35.414 --> 01:37:36.894
There'’s a name for 'em.

01:37:36.938 --> 01:37:40.767
I used to know the name
for them, some kind of...

01:37:41.943 --> 01:37:43.118
They'’re very beautiful.

01:37:54.477 --> 01:37:56.871
I think my marriage
is over, Dad.

01:38:10.493 --> 01:38:15.890
I know my little gal
wouldn'’t say anything
until she absolutely has to.

01:38:23.898 --> 01:38:26.813
There'’s going to be another
Congressional Investigation.

01:38:28.076 --> 01:38:30.078
He wants me to speak out.

01:38:30.121 --> 01:38:31.775
Go on the record.

01:38:35.474 --> 01:38:38.260
Like that would suddenly
make all this go away.

01:38:41.872 --> 01:38:44.657
We can'’t even
speak to each other.

01:38:44.701 --> 01:38:47.617
I can remember saying
exactly the same thing.

01:38:47.660 --> 01:38:49.575
July '’72.

01:38:49.619 --> 01:38:52.839
Me and your mom weren'’t getting
along and fighting all the time.

01:38:52.883 --> 01:38:57.148
I guess she'’d just plain
had enough of moving house.

01:39:01.936 --> 01:39:04.851
It wasn'’t until I retired
25 years in the Air Force,

01:39:04.895 --> 01:39:07.637
I realized that we
never did have a home.

01:39:09.204 --> 01:39:12.033
We must'’ve moved
20 different times.

01:39:12.076 --> 01:39:14.818
I don'’t know, Germany,
Singapore,

01:39:14.861 --> 01:39:16.559
Australia, England.

01:39:20.041 --> 01:39:24.088
You had 20 different chances
to introduce yourself
to someone new.

01:39:24.132 --> 01:39:26.395
Turned out all right,
though, okay.

01:39:26.438 --> 01:39:31.791
I mean, you'’re responsible,
a little too serious, maybe.

01:39:33.576 --> 01:39:35.882
Made you tough, though.
Made you real tough.

01:39:38.537 --> 01:39:42.367
Probably, tougher than me and
your mom could ever understand.

01:39:44.108 --> 01:39:46.850
I just can'’t see how
this comes around.

01:39:50.071 --> 01:39:54.814
Not this time, not anymore.

01:39:54.858 --> 01:39:57.513
What they did was wrong, Val.
It'’s just plain wrong.

01:39:57.556 --> 01:39:59.384
Don'’t you ever forget that.

01:40:01.256 --> 01:40:04.781
You see, through some miracle,
you get through this thing,

01:40:04.824 --> 01:40:08.132
there'’s no guarantee that
you and Joe won'’t fight.

01:40:08.176 --> 01:40:10.613
He'’s a stubborn son of a bitch.

01:40:10.656 --> 01:40:13.442
He'’s not going to give up
any more than you are.

01:40:16.445 --> 01:40:19.361
[Samantha] Grandpa look.

01:40:19.404 --> 01:40:22.929
I swear to God she'’s going
to keep at that thing
till she licks it.

01:40:22.973 --> 01:40:24.583
Come on, raise your hand up.

01:40:24.627 --> 01:40:27.108
There you go.

01:40:27.151 --> 01:40:28.935
Good shot.

01:40:28.979 --> 01:40:32.287
-[Sam] I need to do it again.
-Yeah!

01:40:33.418 --> 01:40:34.985
Good try.

01:40:38.771 --> 01:40:41.209
-Shit. Mom!
-[Chris Mathews]
....the final result,

01:40:41.252 --> 01:40:43.298
and it turned out
to be bad news for one member
of the White House team,

01:40:43.341 --> 01:40:46.736
and a central figure he is,
Scooter Libby, five counts.

01:40:46.779 --> 01:40:50.348
And, as Brian Williams
just said on NBC news
in that special report,

01:40:50.392 --> 01:40:52.611
30 years he faces right now.

01:40:52.655 --> 01:40:54.483
I want to talk right
now to Dan Abrams,

01:40:54.526 --> 01:40:56.354
my colleague who handles
these legal matters.

01:40:56.398 --> 01:40:58.574
[Abrams] You can imagine that
the letter of resignation

01:40:58.617 --> 01:41:01.664
was probably drafted
somewhat in advance

01:41:01.707 --> 01:41:05.537
in that there were indications
in the past.

01:41:05.581 --> 01:41:07.365
[woman] What is next?

01:41:07.409 --> 01:41:10.455
Lawyers for Lewis Scooter Libby
are preparing his defense

01:41:10.499 --> 01:41:12.762
following his
indictment Friday.

01:41:12.805 --> 01:41:15.417
Meanwhile, President Bush
is set to announce
his next nominee

01:41:15.460 --> 01:41:18.289
to replace Sandra Day O'’Connor
on the Supreme Court.

01:41:18.333 --> 01:41:21.162
[telephone ringing]

01:41:21.205 --> 01:41:23.207
[male reporter]
...the indictment today,
according to sources,

01:41:23.251 --> 01:41:26.123
still faces a possible
perjury charge.

01:41:26.167 --> 01:41:27.994
There are two things here.

01:41:28.038 --> 01:41:31.737
First of all, the Karl Rove
business about today,

01:41:31.781 --> 01:41:34.000
the fact that he was
not indicted today,

01:41:34.044 --> 01:41:37.047
is certainly what you would
call interim good news.

01:41:37.091 --> 01:41:39.354
But it can only be called
interim good news

01:41:39.397 --> 01:41:43.749
because, as you know,
the investigation in so
far as he is concerned,

01:41:43.793 --> 01:41:45.099
is going to--

01:42:14.519 --> 01:42:17.870
They served up Scooter Libby,
he'’s going to take the fall.

01:42:21.309 --> 01:42:25.791
I'’m sure he probably
brokered a deal, he takes
the fall, deck is stacked.

01:42:25.835 --> 01:42:28.925
He gets pardoned, bet there
won'’t even be a trial.

01:42:42.112 --> 01:42:44.070
I don'’t care...

01:42:46.160 --> 01:42:47.726
what they say about us.

01:42:47.770 --> 01:42:52.209
I don'’t care how angry you get.

01:42:52.253 --> 01:42:55.343
If they take all this away,
I don'’t care.

01:42:56.431 --> 01:42:58.955
They do not get to take

01:42:58.998 --> 01:43:00.913
my marriage.

01:43:05.570 --> 01:43:07.050
I'’m so sorry.

01:43:08.965 --> 01:43:10.662
You did good.

01:43:12.751 --> 01:43:14.100
I did it for me.

01:43:14.144 --> 01:43:16.364
I know why you did it.

01:43:18.540 --> 01:43:19.671
Thank you.

01:43:26.809 --> 01:43:28.724
If I could give it back to you,

01:43:31.117 --> 01:43:34.947
if I could give you
back who you were...

01:43:39.996 --> 01:43:41.519
This is who I am.

01:43:43.260 --> 01:43:44.783
Right here.

01:44:05.195 --> 01:44:07.110
Are you ready to fight?

01:44:10.766 --> 01:44:11.897
Good.

01:44:14.378 --> 01:44:18.208
How many of you know
the 16 words in President Bush'’s
State of the Union address

01:44:18.252 --> 01:44:19.470
that led us to war?

01:44:21.864 --> 01:44:24.475
How many know my wife'’s name?

01:44:24.519 --> 01:44:25.998
[all] Valerie.

01:44:26.042 --> 01:44:29.828
Now, how can you know
one and not the other?

01:44:29.872 --> 01:44:35.486
When did the question move
from "Why are we going to war?"

01:44:35.530 --> 01:44:37.706
to "Who is this man'’s wife?"

01:44:37.749 --> 01:44:39.969
I asked the first question,

01:44:40.012 --> 01:44:42.319
but somebody else
asked the second,

01:44:42.363 --> 01:44:47.455
and it worked because
none of us know the truth.

01:44:47.498 --> 01:44:50.980
The offense that was committed
was not committed against me.

01:44:51.023 --> 01:44:53.809
It was not committed
against my wife.

01:44:53.852 --> 01:44:58.074
It was committed against you,
all of you.

01:44:58.117 --> 01:45:02.034
If that makes you angry
or feel misrepresented,

01:45:02.078 --> 01:45:04.994
do something about it.

01:45:05.037 --> 01:45:08.650
When Benjamin Franklin
left Independence Hall

01:45:08.693 --> 01:45:10.565
just after the second drafting,

01:45:10.608 --> 01:45:12.610
he was approached by
a woman on the street.

01:45:12.654 --> 01:45:16.484
The woman said, "Mr. Franklin,

01:45:16.527 --> 01:45:19.617
what manner of government
have you bequeathed us?"

01:45:21.576 --> 01:45:23.491
And Franklin said,

01:45:26.189 --> 01:45:31.629
"A republic, madam,
if you can keep it."

01:45:31.673 --> 01:45:34.066
The responsibility
for our country

01:45:34.110 --> 01:45:38.810
is not in the hands
of a privileged few.

01:45:38.854 --> 01:45:42.771
We are strong and we
are free from tyranny

01:45:42.814 --> 01:45:48.733
as long as each one of us
remembers his or her duty
as a citizen.

01:45:48.777 --> 01:45:52.389
Whether it'’s to report
a pothole at the top
of your street

01:45:52.433 --> 01:45:55.697
or lies in a State of a Union
address, speak out.

01:45:55.740 --> 01:45:57.525
Ask those questions.

01:45:57.568 --> 01:45:59.440
Demand that truth.

01:45:59.483 --> 01:46:02.399
Democracy is not
a free ride, man,

01:46:02.443 --> 01:46:04.096
I'’m here to tell you,

01:46:04.140 --> 01:46:07.752
but this is where we live.

01:46:07.796 --> 01:46:10.364
And if we do our job,

01:46:10.407 --> 01:46:12.931
this is where
our children will live.

01:46:14.411 --> 01:46:16.108
God bless you.

01:46:16.152 --> 01:46:17.980
[applause]

01:46:18.023 --> 01:46:19.068
[mouths] Thank you.

01:46:21.940 --> 01:46:24.290
[man] Ms. Wilson, we'’re
pleased to have you here.

01:46:24.334 --> 01:46:27.729
Thank you very much for coming
to our committee today.

01:46:27.772 --> 01:46:30.079
The practice of this committee
is that all witnesses

01:46:30.122 --> 01:46:32.734
are administered an oath

01:46:32.777 --> 01:46:36.128
and I would like to ask you
to stand and raise your hand.

01:46:36.172 --> 01:46:39.349
Do you promise to tell the truth
and nothing but the truth?

01:46:39.393 --> 01:46:40.872
-I do.
-Please be seated.

01:46:44.659 --> 01:46:47.705
Now, there'’s a button
on the base of the mic,
be sure to press it in

01:46:47.749 --> 01:46:51.579
and pull it closely enough
to you so you can be heard.

01:46:54.756 --> 01:46:58.324
Good morning, Mr. Chairman,
and members of the committee.

01:46:59.456 --> 01:47:01.632
My name is Valerie Plame Wilson

01:47:01.676 --> 01:47:06.637
and I'’m honored to have been
invited to testify under oath

01:47:06.681 --> 01:47:10.119
before the Committee on
Oversight in Government Reform

01:47:10.162 --> 01:47:15.080
on the critical issue
of safe-guarding
classified information.

01:47:15.124 --> 01:47:19.998
I'’m grateful for
this opportunity to set
the record straight.

01:47:20.042 --> 01:47:22.261
I'’ve served the
United States loyally

01:47:22.305 --> 01:47:26.788
and to the best of my ability
as a covert operations officer

01:47:26.831 --> 01:47:29.486
for the Central Intelligence
Agency.

01:47:29.530 --> 01:47:33.272
I worked on behalf
of the national security
of our country,

01:47:33.316 --> 01:47:36.101
on behalf of the people
of the United States,

01:47:36.145 --> 01:47:39.496
until my name and true
affiliation were exposed

01:47:39.540 --> 01:47:43.544
in the national media
on July 14, 2003,

01:47:43.587 --> 01:47:46.938
after a leak by
administration officials.

01:47:46.982 --> 01:47:51.029
Today, I can tell this
committee even more.

01:47:51.073 --> 01:47:53.292
In the ran up to
the war with Iraq,

01:47:53.336 --> 01:47:56.774
I worked in the counter
proliferation division
of the CIA,

01:47:56.818 --> 01:47:58.863
still as a covert officer

01:47:58.907 --> 01:48:02.780
whose affiliation with the CIA
was classified.

01:48:02.824 --> 01:48:07.132
I race to discover
solid intelligence for
senior policy makers

01:48:07.176 --> 01:48:11.528
on Iraq'’s presumed weapons
of mass destruction programs.

01:48:11.572 --> 01:48:15.401
While I helped to manage
and run secret,
world-wide operations

01:48:15.445 --> 01:48:20.276
against WMD target from CIA
headquarters in Washington,

01:48:20.319 --> 01:48:25.673
I also traveled to foreign
countries on secret missions

01:48:25.716 --> 01:48:28.110
to find vital intelligence.

01:48:28.153 --> 01:48:31.548
I love my career because
I love my country.

01:48:31.592 --> 01:48:34.551
I was proud of the serious
responsibilities entrusted

01:48:34.595 --> 01:48:38.381
to me as a CIA covert
operations officer.
