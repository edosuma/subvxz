WEBVTT

00:04.417 --> 00:06.485
So, Ryder has left you
in charge?

00:06.553 --> 00:09.455
Until he gets back from visiting
his sister in Calgary, yep.

00:09.523 --> 00:11.624
- Yeah? When does he get back?
- Monday.

00:11.691 --> 00:14.492
- Until then, I'm supervisor.
- Acting supervisor.

00:14.560 --> 00:16.995
Look, it took long enough to
convince Ryder to even give me

00:17.063 --> 00:19.064
this chance. I cannot let
anything go wrong.

00:19.132 --> 00:21.266
- Not on my watch.
- You'll be fine, man.

00:21.333 --> 00:24.002
(Other guys talking)

00:24.070 --> 00:27.639
That'll be all,
Mr. Logan.

00:27.706 --> 00:29.640
- Yes, sir.
- That'll be all.

Hello, Manny.
It's been a while.

00:53.731 --> 00:56.265
So, how'd you find me?

00:56.333 --> 01:00.235
I have my sources.

01:00.303 --> 01:03.839
Right to the point.
Some things don't change.

01:03.907 --> 01:05.741
Finish your wine.

01:12.315 --> 01:13.749
You're here alone?

01:13.817 --> 01:17.518
I didn't want to make a scene.
Are you carrying?

01:17.586 --> 01:20.755
- You know how I feel about guns.
- Ready to go?

01:20.823 --> 01:22.924
I am.

01:22.991 --> 01:26.194
But not with you.

01:26.261 --> 01:30.131
That gentleman over there is with me.
You make a move, and you'll be dead

01:30.199 --> 01:33.700
before the cuffs clear the bar. I would
hate to see that happen to a friend.

01:33.768 --> 01:36.036
How do I know
you're not bluffing?

01:36.104 --> 01:38.371
Good night, Michelle.

01:40.608 --> 01:44.611
It really was wonderful to see you again,
but let's not make a habit of it, OK?

01:44.678 --> 01:47.447
Manny.

01:47.514 --> 01:51.550
Next time, make sure the guy you're using
for your bluff doesn't work for me.

01:56.656 --> 01:59.158
You're really enjoying this,
aren't you?

02:01.561 --> 02:03.362
You have no idea.

02:03.429 --> 02:05.163
Let's go.

02:05.283 --> 02:14.445
<font color="#ec14bd">Sync & corrections by honeybunny</font>
<font color="#ec14bd">www.addic7ed.com</font>

02:15.389 --> 02:17.290
Really, Manny?
The silent treatment?

02:17.358 --> 02:19.759
You think
that's a smart play here?

02:19.827 --> 02:22.128
You don't want to talk,
you don't want a lawyer,

02:22.196 --> 02:24.063
so what do you want?

02:24.131 --> 02:26.232
A 27ounce rib-eye would be
nice.

02:26.300 --> 02:28.767
Maybe a little shiraz
to wash it down.

02:28.835 --> 02:31.203
I can get him a bag of chips,
some coffee if you'd like.

02:31.270 --> 02:35.073
- What do you think?
- Or you could chew on this.

02:35.141 --> 02:38.143
Parking lot camera
at the Nemitz Gallery, 2005.

02:38.211 --> 02:41.246
- You recognize anyone?
- Never seen him before.

02:41.314 --> 02:43.548
He's handsome, though.
That's all you got?

02:43.616 --> 02:46.451
The Yorkville Art Market, 2006.

02:46.519 --> 02:50.288
Security cameras disabled,
but the ATM camera next door

02:50.356 --> 02:53.125
- not so much.
- This is small-time stuff.

02:53.192 --> 02:56.561
You're right. I might not be
able to put you away for life,

02:56.629 --> 02:59.663
but 18-20 is nothing
to sniff at.

02:59.731 --> 03:03.734
So what do you say, Manny?
You got some names for us?

03:03.801 --> 03:07.004
<i>Biggest job of my life,</i>
<i>and you're screwing it up.</i>

03:07.072 --> 03:09.840
This next one's a big one,
isn't it?

03:09.908 --> 03:12.910
It's the game changer.

03:12.977 --> 03:15.012
Come on,

03:15.079 --> 03:18.014
how do I know about the last
painting you stole here in town?

03:18.082 --> 03:21.518
<i>Nice try, pal. Nobody knows about
the Toussaint but me and Eddie.</i>

03:21.585 --> 03:24.720
I imagine the Toussaint will buy
you a lot of steak dinners, huh?

03:29.226 --> 03:31.893
How's it going with Manny?

03:31.961 --> 03:37.232
Well, I think Toby just opened
the door for us.

03:37.300 --> 03:38.867
Last chance, Manny.

03:38.935 --> 03:40.669
What's it gonna be?

03:46.409 --> 03:48.943
OK.

03:49.010 --> 03:51.245
Yeah, there's a job.

03:51.313 --> 03:53.814
Head guy's name is
Trevor Whelan.

03:56.017 --> 04:01.556
- Now we're getting somewhere.
- [Michelle]: <i>Who else is on the crew?</i>

04:01.623 --> 04:03.557
We don't find out
until the day, and even then

04:03.624 --> 04:09.296
- we use codenames.
- No. That's not good enough.

04:09.363 --> 04:10.930
All right, wait, wait.

04:10.998 --> 04:13.800
The food chain goes up.

04:13.867 --> 04:16.536
Whelan has a boss.

04:16.603 --> 04:19.005
I hear he's a big player

04:19.072 --> 04:21.773
- on the European market.
- No name, no deal.

04:21.841 --> 04:24.343
I only know
who I know, sweetheart.

04:28.548 --> 04:30.483
OK, here we go.

04:30.550 --> 04:34.487
- Trevor Whelan.
- Linked to six major art thefts

04:34.554 --> 04:37.888
in the last four years. Eight
arrests, but no convictions.

04:37.956 --> 04:40.191
So how does a guy like this
keep getting cut loose?

04:40.259 --> 04:42.227
He always has an alibi.
He leaves no

04:42.294 --> 04:45.396
physical evidence at the scene.
There's no trail to follow.

04:45.464 --> 04:47.632
In order to make the charges
stick, we have to catch him

04:47.699 --> 04:50.135
in the act. Unfortunately, he always
seems to be two steps ahead of us.

04:50.202 --> 04:52.402
- Maybe not this time.
- Whelan's a big fish,

04:52.470 --> 04:56.607
no question, but I want to know what
European boss he's in bed with. Hojgaard?

04:56.674 --> 04:59.709
- No, he'd never work with North Americans.
- De Luca? Carnicero?

04:59.777 --> 05:02.612
De Luca lost most of his
business after his third bust

05:02.680 --> 05:06.449
last year. Carnicero...
it's possible.

05:06.517 --> 05:09.719
Well, we're on to something big here.
I can feel it. I want to know more.

05:13.090 --> 05:15.091
So, tell us about this job.

05:15.159 --> 05:17.059
You said the crew uses
codenames?

05:17.127 --> 05:19.461
Whelan's idea.
He goes by Grumpy.

05:19.529 --> 05:22.597
- Grumpy?
- We're all named after the Seven Dwarves.

05:22.666 --> 05:25.500
- And you? What's your name?
- Bashful.

05:25.568 --> 05:27.536
- That's cute.
- Not my first choice.

05:27.603 --> 05:29.237
What's the target gallery?

05:29.305 --> 05:31.239
We don't find out until
the day of. I'm telling you,

05:31.307 --> 05:33.808
this guy is careful.
He's bordering on paranoid.

05:35.811 --> 05:38.412
But he tends to go for that
post-impressionist junk.

05:41.150 --> 05:43.685
- But it's for sure a go?
- As soon as Whelan finds

05:43.752 --> 05:46.754
his security systems specialist,
we're good to go.

05:46.822 --> 05:51.224
- What kind of system?
- Vance-Nord. High-tech stuff.

05:51.292 --> 05:55.195
OK. You're gonna
do something for me.

05:55.262 --> 05:58.699
- All right, I'm listening.
- You're gonna get in touch with this Whelan,

05:58.766 --> 06:03.103
and you're gonna tell him that you
found your security systems expert.

06:03.171 --> 06:05.604
<i>So you're a professional</i>
<i>art thief now?</i>

06:05.672 --> 06:07.873
- Should I be hiding my Monet?
- I do have

06:07.941 --> 06:10.976
- undercover experience.
- You're talking about the Roth case.

06:11.044 --> 06:12.745
Yes, the Roth case.
We suspected a security company

06:12.813 --> 06:15.114
of rigging their systems
to fail. To prove it,

06:15.182 --> 06:17.917
I learned system specs
of every major manufacturer.

06:17.984 --> 06:20.418
Yeah, that was all academic.
Applying that knowledge

06:20.485 --> 06:22.954
in the field is a whole
different skill set.

06:23.022 --> 06:26.524
I can do this. If we pull it off, we follow
the trail right back to Whelan's boss.

06:26.592 --> 06:29.861
All right, you need hands-on training,
a crash course in security hacks.

06:29.929 --> 06:33.231
Well, that I can help with. I
think I can get her up to speed.

06:33.298 --> 06:36.600
OK. Dev, get her
everything she needs to learn

06:36.667 --> 06:38.969
- these new systems.
- I'll need a cover story.

06:39.037 --> 06:43.340
Whelan's careful. Make sure it's airtight.
He'll do his research.

06:45.409 --> 06:48.445
Hi. Can I have your autograph?
I'm a huge fan.

06:51.982 --> 06:55.017
You know, 'cause an autograph is
like a... signature.

06:55.085 --> 06:58.154
It's... OK.
Tough crowd. Hey.

06:58.222 --> 07:01.157
Hey. Oh, that reminds me. I have
something to talk to you about.

07:01.225 --> 07:04.994
- Oh, uh, how can I help you?
- We have-- Ow! Ow! Mr.--

07:05.062 --> 07:09.330
Mr. Hibbard, how many times do I have to tell you?
That is not appropriate?

07:09.398 --> 07:12.000
Tessa, did I ever tell you

07:12.068 --> 07:14.469
that you look
at stunning as ever?

07:14.536 --> 07:17.639
- Tessa?
- Allison,

07:17.706 --> 07:20.308
do you mind escorting Mr.
Hibbard back to his bed, please?

07:20.376 --> 07:23.311
- I'll see you later, Tessa.
- OK.

07:23.379 --> 07:26.313
I've got a surprise
for you tonight.

07:28.750 --> 07:30.951
Well, somebody's hot
for Doctor.

07:31.019 --> 07:36.257
Dementia--with Alzheimer's. Anyway,
he thinks I'm his dead wife.

07:36.324 --> 07:38.893
Poor guy. Although,
on the bright side,

07:38.960 --> 07:41.428
it does give him licence
to pinch bums whenever he wants.

07:41.496 --> 07:45.265
- Do not make fun. - What? That's a bonus.
- Anyway, I need some advice

07:45.333 --> 07:48.201
on how to deal with Ryder about
a situation we have right here.

07:48.269 --> 07:50.270
First of all, Ryder's out
of town. I'm the acting

07:50.338 --> 07:52.872
supervisor right now,
so maybe I can help?

07:52.940 --> 07:55.842
Well, Mrs. Slatterly came in
today--mild heart attack.

07:55.910 --> 07:58.911
She's claiming that someone
stole her bracelet.

07:58.978 --> 08:02.214
- One of the staff?
- She says it's one of your guys--one of the paramedics.

08:02.282 --> 08:04.883
(He sighs)
OK, I'll look into it.

08:04.951 --> 08:07.853
- I don't want to get anybody in trouble, and just--
- No, no, it's part of the job.

08:07.921 --> 08:10.956
- Come on. I got it.
- OK. Thanks. - Hey, no problem.

08:14.627 --> 08:18.463
- [Toby]: Still nothing.
- He'll be here.

08:18.531 --> 08:20.898
Unless he smells a setup
in that cover story you planted.

08:20.966 --> 08:22.900
No way.
It's ironclad.

08:22.968 --> 08:25.503
I hacked it deep
into every law enforcement

08:25.571 --> 08:27.939
and underground
criminal database I know--

08:28.006 --> 08:29.740
and I know a few.

08:33.812 --> 08:36.480
See? What'd I tell you?
Here we go.

08:42.953 --> 08:45.988
Get in.
Girl in the front.

08:47.000 --> 08:53.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

08:55.833 --> 08:58.701
So, how is it I never
heard of you before?

08:58.769 --> 09:00.869
I keep a low profile.

09:00.936 --> 09:04.205
You used to be in security design?
Griffin Security, was it?

09:04.273 --> 09:08.510
Yeah. High-end cyber-locks. I was
there for about three years.

09:08.578 --> 09:13.014
- What systems did you work on?
- I cut my teeth on the Magnatron series,

09:13.082 --> 09:16.650
did some preliminary specs
for the Werewolf 360 sensor...

09:16.718 --> 09:18.619
<i>But it was the seven-point</i>
<i>Diamond clip--</i>

09:18.687 --> 09:21.889
- Clamp. - What did I say?
- You said "clip".

09:21.956 --> 09:24.224
(She sighs) Keep going.

09:24.292 --> 09:28.061
Then there's the big one.
The work I'm most proud of is...

09:28.129 --> 09:29.597
<i>The Griffin-X4--</i>

09:29.664 --> 09:31.832
designed that
from the ground up.

09:31.900 --> 09:34.133
I don't remember seeing
your name in the design credits.

09:34.201 --> 09:38.337
Head of R&D stole my specs,
got me blacklisted.

09:38.406 --> 09:42.776
I quickly learned there's more money
in system cracks than system design.

09:42.843 --> 09:45.412
What's this I hear
about a recent job you pulled?

09:45.479 --> 09:49.315
- Some old stamp?
- Yeah, the Lipreski Collection.

09:49.383 --> 09:51.550
I manually disabled
a laser system.

09:51.618 --> 09:53.585
<i>I went in through a skylight,</i>

09:53.653 --> 09:57.723
- and two minutes later I came out with an 1846--
- Oh, that's wrong.

09:57.791 --> 09:59.058
Eighteen forty-seven.

09:59.126 --> 10:00.559
I knew that.
It just came out wrong.

10:00.627 --> 10:02.461
- Do you want to take a break?
- No, I'm good.

10:02.529 --> 10:06.630
Eighteen forty-seven
two-penny Mauritius worth...

10:06.750 --> 10:10.716
1.8 million. That's not bad
for "some old stamp".

10:10.836 --> 10:12.403
I'm impressed.

10:12.471 --> 10:15.807
I don't know many people
that could disable a laser L9.

10:15.874 --> 10:18.275
I think you mean the L7.

10:21.212 --> 10:24.180
The L9's still
under development.

10:24.248 --> 10:27.350
(He chuckles)
Enough foreplay.

10:27.418 --> 10:29.886
Tell me
about decentralized electric

10:29.954 --> 10:31.822
- mortis locks.
- Smart doors.

10:31.889 --> 10:33.890
They work independently.
The only way to take them all

10:33.958 --> 10:36.426
down at once is
to re-centralize them.

10:36.494 --> 10:39.628
Impossible. They're not tied
to a central processor.

10:39.696 --> 10:42.198
I can't give away
all my trade secrets.

10:42.266 --> 10:44.567
Fine. Show me instead.

10:44.634 --> 10:47.470
There's a jewellery store behind
us, two doors down. You see it?

10:49.440 --> 10:51.107
[Michelle]: <i>Yeah, I see it.</i>

10:51.175 --> 10:53.409
[Whelan]: <i>Independently owned,</i>
<i>always closed on Sundays.</i>

10:53.477 --> 10:55.444
Nothing too complicated,
but should suffice

10:55.511 --> 10:57.879
- for this little test.
- What kind of test?

10:57.947 --> 11:00.015
You want on this crew,
you're gonna hit it for me.

11:00.083 --> 11:01.916
Right now.

11:13.838 --> 11:15.606
I need my gear.

11:15.674 --> 11:17.874
You're as good as you say,
you don't need anything

11:17.942 --> 11:19.543
<i>that isn't in your handbag.</i>

11:23.481 --> 11:25.994
You could walk away from this
right now.

11:26.263 --> 11:30.033
- Is she prepared for this?
- Not nearly as much as I'd like, but it's her call.

11:32.002 --> 11:34.603
This is a waste of time,
but fine.

11:36.606 --> 11:38.774
How long do you figure it'll
take to disable the system?

11:38.843 --> 11:42.477
- Eight minutes total.
- I'll give you five.

11:42.545 --> 11:46.915
You'll give me eight, and you
won't question my timings again.

11:46.983 --> 11:49.351
Fine.
Clock's already running.

12:35.929 --> 12:38.597
Are you close enough
to read Whelan?

12:38.664 --> 12:42.034
There's a lot of interference, but
I think I can hone in on him.

12:42.102 --> 12:45.170
So, what happens if she's not
back in time? Is she out?

12:45.238 --> 12:47.773
Something like that.

12:47.840 --> 12:50.910
<i>Won't be the first time</i>
<i>I've had to bury a loose end.</i>

13:14.132 --> 13:16.766
Seven minutes, 47 seconds.

13:22.040 --> 13:24.273
Pictures are one thing...

13:30.747 --> 13:33.115
Looks like we've found
our security systems expert.

13:33.183 --> 13:36.085
That's great, man.
You won't be sorry.

13:36.153 --> 13:39.788
- So when do I get to meet the big boss?
- What are you talking about?

13:42.391 --> 13:46.161
<i>I didn't know you were in town.</i>

13:46.228 --> 13:49.264
I like to know
who I'm working for.

13:49.332 --> 13:51.532
<i>I wasn't expecting you</i>
<i>so soon, Carnicero.</i>

13:53.869 --> 13:56.937
- What's up? You got something?
- Oh, yeah.

13:57.005 --> 13:59.773
I give the orders,
I get you your cut, that's it.

13:59.841 --> 14:02.742
There's nobody else
that concerns you. Are we clear?

14:02.810 --> 14:04.945
Yeah.

14:05.013 --> 14:07.881
I'll be in contact soon
with the rendezvous details.

14:07.949 --> 14:12.385
- You'll meet Doc, our driver, there.
- Do I get a nickname too?

14:12.453 --> 14:15.154
I'm thinking Happy.

14:15.222 --> 14:17.623
I was hoping for Snow White.

14:17.691 --> 14:19.625
That's cute.

14:19.693 --> 14:22.561
I don't like cute. Out.

14:24.431 --> 14:28.166
- Hey, what are you doing?
- Finders keepers. A girl's gotta eat.

14:31.737 --> 14:36.041
I'll be damned.
Carnicero's in our own backyard.

14:36.109 --> 14:39.244
We asked for the big fish, and
we got the great white whale.

14:39.312 --> 14:41.179
So, who is this guy?
What's his story?

14:41.247 --> 14:43.848
He's one of the most powerful
art fences in the world.

14:43.916 --> 14:46.683
Guy showed up out of nowhere
a few years back. Now we figure

14:46.751 --> 14:48.952
that more than half of all
stolen and black-market art

14:49.021 --> 14:51.122
filters through
his organization.

14:51.189 --> 14:55.226
- We can't shut him down? The cops can't shut him down?
- Well, he says well hidden.

14:55.293 --> 14:58.229
I mean, all we have to go on is the
name and, of course, his reputation.

14:58.296 --> 15:00.763
- What's his rep?
- "Carnicero" is Spanish for

15:00.831 --> 15:04.234
"butcher". Word is
he lives up to the name.

15:04.301 --> 15:07.037
If he's in town for the score,
Whelan could lead us right to him.

15:07.104 --> 15:10.040
He's got to be in contact with
someone here other than Whelan.

15:10.107 --> 15:13.109
Let's put a list together of local art
felons and their known associates.

15:13.177 --> 15:15.578
- That's a big list.
- Not if we narrow it down

15:15.646 --> 15:18.880
to people with ties to Europe
over the last two years. - OK.

15:18.948 --> 15:21.250
McCluskey's at the place
we set up?

15:21.317 --> 15:23.452
And you got her up to speed
on the Vance-Nord system?

15:23.520 --> 15:27.423
- She should be going through it as we speak.
- OK. Fingers crossed.

15:30.693 --> 15:33.727
(Knocking on door)
Mrs. Slatterly?

15:33.795 --> 15:36.697
Hi. I'm acting Supervisor
Osman Bey. I--

15:36.765 --> 15:38.666
- What, you've come back
for more?

15:38.733 --> 15:41.335
I don't have anything else
of value.

15:41.403 --> 15:43.637
No, actually, I just wanted
to let you know that we're doing

15:43.705 --> 15:46.907
everything we can to track down
your missing bracelet. - It's not missing;

15:46.975 --> 15:50.510
it was stolen.
Why don't we just start at the beginning?

15:50.578 --> 15:54.181
- Well, I was shopping in the--
- Hang on.

15:54.248 --> 15:56.883
- I was shopping--
- Just a second.

15:59.820 --> 16:01.888
Uh, go ahead.

16:01.956 --> 16:03.423
Right.

16:03.491 --> 16:05.724
I was shopping at the mall,

16:05.792 --> 16:08.394
and I started
to have chest pains.

16:08.462 --> 16:12.030
Your guys showed up and
they put me in the ambulance.

16:12.099 --> 16:14.133
And then the tall one,

16:14.201 --> 16:18.370
he said that he had to take off my
bracelet so he could put in an IV.

16:18.438 --> 16:20.838
He tells me
he put it in my purse.

16:20.906 --> 16:22.907
That's
standard procedure, ma'am.

16:22.975 --> 16:25.743
Yes, but when I checked
my purse, it was gone.

16:25.811 --> 16:29.314
Have other people been
in this room?

16:29.381 --> 16:31.916
I don't know.
I-I-I can't keep track

16:31.984 --> 16:33.818
of everyone who comes
in and out and in and out.

16:33.885 --> 16:36.487
Right. OK. Of course.
I understand.

16:36.554 --> 16:38.822
It was a gift

16:38.889 --> 16:41.825
from my daughter.

16:41.892 --> 16:43.327
Please.

16:43.394 --> 16:45.295
Help me get it back.

16:48.666 --> 16:51.901
OK. So, once I'm plugged
into the gallery interface,

16:51.969 --> 16:54.903
<i>I run this program, and</i>
<i>it takes out the motion sensors</i>

16:54.971 --> 16:57.607
<i>and pressure plates.</i>
<i>OK, now for the tricky part.</i>

16:57.674 --> 17:01.210
The smart doors aren't tied to the
interface; they're individually rigged.

17:01.278 --> 17:03.679
<i>But each door does have</i>
<i>the same computer chip,</i>

17:03.747 --> 17:05.580
<i>which means they're linked</i>
<i>by a similar element.</i>

17:05.648 --> 17:08.851
They're electronic.
They key is the power supply.

17:08.917 --> 17:11.153
<i>You got it.</i>
<i>OK, now,</i>

17:11.220 --> 17:13.588
by tapping into the building's
power supply and sending

17:13.656 --> 17:16.825
the right level of fluctuation to the
doors, the computer chips will reset.

17:20.696 --> 17:22.998
Damn. What did I do wrong?

17:23.066 --> 17:25.833
Try increasing the power flow
incrementally. Too much surge

17:25.901 --> 17:28.234
will automatically trigger
the alarms.

17:32.307 --> 17:34.575
(Dev laughs) Nice work, lady.

17:34.643 --> 17:36.610
But one shot,
so keep practicing.

17:36.679 --> 17:39.747
So, Whelan just sent word to Manny.
He wants to pick you guys up

17:39.815 --> 17:41.882
at the same location
in about half an hour.

17:41.949 --> 17:45.218
OK. I'll go get Manny out of holding
and get him all geeded him.

17:45.286 --> 17:49.790
- OK.
<i>- Hey. So I imagine this would be a lot easier</i>

17:49.857 --> 17:51.992
if Dev was there with you.

17:52.060 --> 17:54.627
<i>Yeah, but if I'm being watched
and they see a cop at my place--</i>

17:54.696 --> 17:56.663
- Oh, your cover's blown.
Got it.

17:56.730 --> 17:58.764
So, uh, how do you feel
about this?

17:58.832 --> 18:00.966
<i>There's just one</i>
<i>last precaution, OK?</i>

18:01.034 --> 18:03.002
<i>I can't wear a wire,</i>
<i>and a phone is too risky,</i>

18:03.070 --> 18:04.970
<i>so if I need</i>
<i>to send you guys a message--</i>

18:05.038 --> 18:08.874
- You want me to read you.
- Just this one time.

18:08.942 --> 18:13.712
<i>Everything is set. Do I need</i>
<i>to remind you to be careful? - No, but.</i>

18:13.746 --> 18:17.082
<i>I'm guessing you will anyway. Best
case scenario, we run the job,</i>

18:17.149 --> 18:19.317
Whelan leads us to Carnicero,
and we take them both down.

18:19.384 --> 18:21.485
But if anything goes wrong,
Michelle,

18:21.553 --> 18:25.256
<i>we cut our losses and
take down Whelan. Got it.</i>

18:25.324 --> 18:28.659
- You want Dev and I to keep an eye on her?
- I've got Metro for that.

18:28.727 --> 18:32.429
I need you guys working the Carnicero angle.
We need to put a face to that name.

18:47.278 --> 18:48.945
Cozy.

18:49.012 --> 18:51.781
Doc.

18:51.849 --> 18:53.550
Say hello to Happy.

18:53.618 --> 18:57.120
Hey. I've heard
good things.

18:57.187 --> 19:00.790
- Cell phones out.
- This has my cracking software.

19:00.858 --> 19:04.026
I can't work without it. - You'll get it
back once I disable the transmitter.

19:04.094 --> 19:06.229
I'm also synching them
to my phone.

19:06.296 --> 19:09.866
So any call you make, any text,
I'll know about it.

19:09.933 --> 19:12.235
Arms and legs apart.

19:12.302 --> 19:15.504
You're checking us for wires?
Really?

19:15.572 --> 19:17.173
Pays to be cautious.

19:17.241 --> 19:19.474
(Scanner beeping)

19:27.116 --> 19:28.984
Caution's a two-way street.

19:32.221 --> 19:36.023
(Scanner beeping)

19:38.426 --> 19:41.195
- Happy?
- That's my name.

19:41.263 --> 19:44.198
Guy's hiding one of the biggest
stolen collections in the city.

19:44.266 --> 19:47.734
Yeah, well, that'll have to wait. Any
hits when I mentioned Carnicero?

19:47.803 --> 19:50.569
The same as everyone else. He's
heard of him, but that's it.

19:50.637 --> 19:52.571
Eleven down, 14 to go.

19:52.639 --> 19:54.473
We've been at this
for a couple hours.

19:54.541 --> 19:56.475
Is there an easier way
to get this information?

19:56.543 --> 20:00.180
Welcome to the glamorous world of
police investigation, my friend.

20:10.457 --> 20:12.358
What's the hold up?

20:12.426 --> 20:14.727
Grumpy likes
to gather the troops early,

20:14.795 --> 20:16.462
keep tabs on us.

20:23.636 --> 20:25.637
- Can I help you?
-- Yeah.

20:25.705 --> 20:28.306
For starters, you could tell me
what gallery we're hitting.

20:28.374 --> 20:31.376
You familiar
with the Simons Gallery?

20:31.444 --> 20:35.447
- Yeah, there are some high-end pieces there.
- Not for long.

20:35.514 --> 20:38.749
They also have newer security applications.
I should update my cracking software.

20:38.817 --> 20:42.853
Whoa. You're not going
anywhere.

20:42.920 --> 20:45.055
What do you think you're doing?

20:49.828 --> 20:53.196
Like I said before, no one's going
anywhere until the job's over.

21:00.295 --> 21:02.780
This how you foster
a healthy team environment?

21:02.900 --> 21:06.033
Have a seat. Relax.

21:06.101 --> 21:08.135
You're the boss.

21:10.905 --> 21:13.473
It's an early Fortin.

21:13.541 --> 21:16.275
Her first foray
into the surreal.

21:16.343 --> 21:19.145
Very popular.
<i>And extremely fake.</i>

21:19.213 --> 21:23.483
- <i>Paint's practically still wet.</i>
<i>- Valla Florian?</i>

21:23.551 --> 21:25.251
Yes, that's me.

21:25.319 --> 21:29.788
- IIB.
- What is this about?

21:29.856 --> 21:33.392
We understand you did some
travelling last summer in Europe.

21:33.459 --> 21:35.961
- What of it?
- You ever hear the name Carnicero?

21:36.029 --> 21:40.365
It's not familiar.
<i>Don't panic. They can't know.</i>

21:40.433 --> 21:42.567
You see, we think
you do know him.

21:42.635 --> 21:48.006
Devon, I have a question.
Is it illegal to sell fake art?

21:48.073 --> 21:50.508
- I think so, yeah.
- Sweetie,

21:50.576 --> 21:53.845
excuse me. Let me
assist these gentlemen.

21:57.416 --> 22:00.918
Everything here is radiocarbon
dated to prove authenticity.

22:00.985 --> 22:03.086
So this is an original?

22:03.154 --> 22:06.089
Hmm. Why is it that I can
still smell the paint?

22:06.157 --> 22:08.425
(He sniffs)

22:08.492 --> 22:10.761
Look, you asked me
about Carnicero.

22:10.828 --> 22:13.463
I just remembered,
I have heard the name.

22:13.531 --> 22:16.799
- Go on.
- He contacted me out of the blue,

22:16.867 --> 22:19.435
asked me to meet him in Nice.
Said he needed a local dealer

22:19.502 --> 22:22.204
he could trust to store
some of his sale pieces.

22:22.272 --> 22:26.542
- So you've seen him in person?
- No. That's not how he does business.

22:33.583 --> 22:35.750
These pieces of his,
did you receive them?

22:35.818 --> 22:38.053
He was supposed
to contact me a few days ago.

22:38.120 --> 22:39.721
I never heard from him.

22:39.789 --> 22:43.491
OK, well, if that changes,
call me immediately.

22:43.559 --> 22:46.961
- Fine.
- Oh, and you might want to double-check the authenticity

22:47.028 --> 22:50.764
of your works for the next
time we visit. Got it?

22:53.401 --> 22:55.569
I saw Carnicero's car in Nice.

22:55.637 --> 22:58.138
It has a vanity plate
that says "Mariposa".

22:58.206 --> 23:00.608
I'll have Interpol run it
and see who it's registered to.

23:00.675 --> 23:02.609
(Dialling on phone)

23:02.676 --> 23:04.611
(Phone ringing)

23:04.678 --> 23:08.047
- Klein.
- Hey. Do you know the name

23:08.115 --> 23:10.449
- <i>Valla Florian?</i>
<i>- Uh, yeah. Um...</i>

23:10.517 --> 23:12.451
- [Man]: Here you go.
- Insurance fraud, right?

23:12.519 --> 23:15.722
Related to, um...
an art theft last year.

23:15.789 --> 23:19.458
It turns out that Carnicero recruited
her a couple months back in France.

23:19.526 --> 23:22.294
<i>She's waiting on further contact.
Do you think we can get a wiretap?</i>

23:22.362 --> 23:25.097
Yeah, I'll run it by the Crown
Attorney's office.

23:25.165 --> 23:27.399
<i>In the meantime, I need you guys to get down to
Whelan's safe-house and check on McCluskey.</i>

23:27.467 --> 23:30.269
- I thought Metro was handing that.
- They are, but she missed

23:30.337 --> 23:32.304
her check-in. There's been
no in and out for hours.

23:32.372 --> 23:34.473
Try to get Logan in
close enough. She may be trying

23:34.541 --> 23:36.907
- to send a message.
<i>- OK, we're on it.</i>

23:36.975 --> 23:39.810
Well, thanks a lot, guys. I
appreciate you checking, all right?

23:39.878 --> 23:41.746
Hey, Oz.
How goes the investigation?

23:41.813 --> 23:43.914
I just talked to the team
that brought Mrs. Slatterly in,

23:43.982 --> 23:46.050
and they're certain that they
put the bracelet in the bag.

23:46.118 --> 23:48.919
I even had them double-check the truck,
make sure it didn't fall out in transit.

23:48.987 --> 23:51.122
Oh. Well, thanks anyway.

23:51.189 --> 23:53.757
I mean, maybe it wasn't EMS. It could
have been taken after the fact.

23:53.824 --> 23:55.659
I guess that's possible.

23:58.496 --> 24:00.930
What about someone like
that guy? They've got access

24:00.998 --> 24:03.433
- to all the patients' rooms.
- Carl?

24:03.501 --> 24:06.170
I guess he's an orderly.
It's part of his job.

24:06.237 --> 24:09.138
I don't know. There's something
about Carl I don't trust.

24:09.206 --> 24:12.408
- He's got really shifty eyes.
- They're not shifty;

24:12.476 --> 24:14.943
he suffers from mild
sensory exotropia.

24:15.011 --> 24:18.013
Well, that would make what I just said
incredibly insensitive, then, wouldn't it?

24:18.081 --> 24:21.417
- Yes, it would.
- Tessa, sweetheart.

24:21.485 --> 24:25.453
- Are you ready for your surprise?
- Maybe later, Mr. Hibbard.

24:25.521 --> 24:28.657
- See you.
- It's her birthday, you know.

24:28.724 --> 24:33.528
Yeah, I'll make sure to get
her a card from the gift shop.

24:33.596 --> 24:36.764
And Carl the orderly,
you just made my list.

24:36.832 --> 24:38.900
(Tapping on the hood)

24:45.473 --> 24:47.474
You OK? You seem
a bit jittery.

24:47.542 --> 24:52.179
Ah, it's the adrenaline. I always
get jazzed up before a job.

24:52.247 --> 24:54.548
That's why we do this, you know.
It's for the rush.

24:54.616 --> 24:58.318
Always on the run,
constant threat of arrest--

24:58.385 --> 25:01.621
what a rush.
- You and I aren't so different.

25:01.689 --> 25:04.023
You say I'm on the run. Who do
you think I'm running from?

25:04.091 --> 25:06.058
I'd rather be the hunter
than the prey.

25:06.126 --> 25:09.929
Ah, yeah. My little sister was
just like you.

25:09.996 --> 25:13.398
She worked eight years
for an insurance company,

25:13.466 --> 25:16.501
saving every penny to take
a trip to the Mediterranean.

25:16.569 --> 25:18.903
That was her dream.

25:18.971 --> 25:22.974
Then one day, boom,
she drops dead.

25:23.042 --> 25:26.010
Brain aneurysm.
Twenty-eight years old.

25:26.078 --> 25:28.346
You know about that, huh?

25:28.413 --> 25:31.649
I spent a lot of nights
going over your fil..

25:31.717 --> 25:35.185
Probably know more about your
family history than I do my own.

25:39.190 --> 25:43.526
My sister was always a small
girl, you know, a slight build.

25:43.594 --> 25:45.662
She was delicate.

25:47.632 --> 25:50.133
Fragile like a butterfly.

25:52.703 --> 25:57.106
- Bet that wasn't in your files.
- Look, I'm sorry for your loss,

25:57.174 --> 25:59.742
but that doesn't excuse
your choices.

25:59.809 --> 26:02.844
These guys you're working with--
Whelan, Carnicero--

26:02.912 --> 26:05.781
- Wait, what? Carnicero?
- Yeah, you know him?

26:05.848 --> 26:08.917
(He sighs) (Door opening)
He's got a nasty reputation.

26:08.985 --> 26:11.453
One mistake on his jobs,
your whole crew disappears.

26:11.521 --> 26:15.023
- That's it. Ready to roll.
- [Whelan]: OK, we leave in 30 minutes.

26:15.091 --> 26:16.724
Thirty minutes.

26:22.197 --> 26:24.165
What if you got in closer?

26:26.101 --> 26:28.469
Brick walls.
No windows.

26:28.537 --> 26:31.673
I might be able to read her, but she's
not gonna know to send anything.

26:31.740 --> 26:33.774
(Phone ringing)

26:36.077 --> 26:37.978
(Toby sighs)

26:38.046 --> 26:40.447
Hey.

26:40.515 --> 26:44.318
- Hey. It's me.
- I'm in the middle of something.

26:44.385 --> 26:48.121
I got a question for your police friends.
What constitutes probable cause for a search?

26:48.189 --> 26:50.423
It's very easy. If you're
in doubt, just don't do it.

26:50.490 --> 26:52.926
OK, cool.
I'm going in.

26:52.993 --> 26:54.493
<i>Oz, hey--</i>

26:59.633 --> 27:01.767
- Hey, what's going on?

27:20.385 --> 27:24.021
- Ah! Carl!
- What the hell are you doing?

27:24.089 --> 27:25.756
I was just checking your lo--

27:25.824 --> 27:28.792
I'm in the middle of this
investigation for stolen--

27:28.861 --> 27:31.028
- I'm reporting this.
- That's not necessary. I was--

27:31.096 --> 27:33.898
You're totally, clearly not involved.
- I'm reporting this.

27:33.966 --> 27:36.032
You'd report to me in the
first place, and I'm clearly--

27:36.067 --> 27:37.968
- I'm reporting this.

27:46.043 --> 27:49.746
- There's gotta be a way.
- I'm open to suggestions.

27:49.813 --> 27:51.848
I've got an idea.

28:33.888 --> 28:35.422
You smell smoke?

28:44.732 --> 28:46.765
Everybody stay put.

28:49.502 --> 28:52.704
Excuse me. I got this.
I got this. I got this.

29:04.583 --> 29:07.485
<i>Simons Gallery. Four of us leaving shortly.
Industrial cleaning van.</i>

29:07.553 --> 29:10.354
- Hey, I said wait inside.
- Where there's fire, there's alarms. I'm not sticking around

29:10.422 --> 29:14.024
- for the cops.
- We're fine. We've got a job to do.

29:32.209 --> 29:34.977
<i>- Target vehicle approaching.</i>
<i>- Stand by.</i>

29:46.790 --> 29:49.391
I don't see Michelle.
Something's not right.

29:49.459 --> 29:51.893
If Whelan's made her,
he won't hesitate to kill her.

29:51.961 --> 29:54.028
We go in now,
we lose our shot at Carnicero.

29:54.096 --> 29:57.499
Klein said anything goes wrong, we
cut our losses, we take Whelan down.

29:57.566 --> 29:59.667
All units move in now!

29:59.735 --> 30:01.870
(Sirens)

30:06.574 --> 30:07.975
Go! Go! Police!

30:08.042 --> 30:10.844
Get down on your knees!
Hands above your head!

30:10.912 --> 30:12.913
Do it! Hey!

30:17.552 --> 30:19.887
- What are you doing here?
- We got called

30:19.954 --> 30:23.556
to do a job at this address.
Work order is in my pocket.

30:23.624 --> 30:25.791
He's telling the truth.
He's just a cleaner.

30:36.469 --> 30:38.537
We lost Michelle.

30:50.378 --> 30:53.287
Hey, this isn't
the Simons Gallery.

30:53.615 --> 30:56.449
- Problem?
- No. I'm impressed.

30:56.517 --> 30:58.818
Keep the crew guessing,
they stay sharp and focused.

30:58.887 --> 31:00.988
Uh-oh. You got me
all figured out.

31:01.055 --> 31:03.056
Now, listen up.

31:03.124 --> 31:05.592
Bartholdi Auction House.
The security system's

31:05.659 --> 31:07.260
virtually identical
to the Simons Gallery.

31:07.374 --> 31:08.498
How many guards on duty?

31:08.618 --> 31:10.748
None. Only thing a guard can
do that this system can't is

31:10.868 --> 31:13.895
get himself killed. Doc stays
with the van. Let's go.

31:14.015 --> 31:15.369
I'll keep it warm for you.

31:20.152 --> 31:24.556
- Thanks. How did you know?
- Just caught a glimpse of it.

31:24.623 --> 31:26.657
(Phone ringing)

31:28.793 --> 31:30.794
Yeah.

31:30.862 --> 31:32.896
Hey, I was asked to call this
number if the cops showed up

31:32.964 --> 31:35.733
- at the gallery.
- You're saying they did?

31:35.800 --> 31:38.736
Hell yeah. Yeah, they were waiting for us.
It was an ambush.

31:40.872 --> 31:42.938
The money will be
in your account.

31:53.384 --> 31:56.218
OK, I'm plugged into VDB's
main security system.

31:56.286 --> 31:59.421
It'll just take a minute
to loop in the signal.

32:01.824 --> 32:04.459
Next up, smart doors.

32:04.527 --> 32:08.129
I did a scout earlier. There's three
doors between here and the showroom.

32:08.197 --> 32:10.365
- OK, well,
we have two options:

32:10.433 --> 32:12.601
one, we disengage each door
separately, which is

32:12.668 --> 32:14.735
the safer play
but more time consuming;

32:14.803 --> 32:18.639
two, we hack into the main power line,
blow all the electronics at once--

32:18.707 --> 32:20.708
fast and dirty,
but more room for error.

32:20.776 --> 32:23.377
Option two.
I have faith in you.

32:29.650 --> 32:32.452
Metro lost them.
Eight other galleries

32:32.520 --> 32:34.687
in the city use the Vance-Nord
system. I say we hit

32:34.755 --> 32:37.924
the closest ones first and work outwards
from there. - There might be an easier way

32:37.991 --> 32:41.661
to do this. Manny said that Whelan
had a thing for post-impressionism.

32:41.729 --> 32:45.097
Most high-end galleries are gonna
have something from that period.

32:45.165 --> 32:48.934
But will every gallery have a
masterpiece worthy of Carnicero?

32:49.001 --> 32:50.803
Right.

32:53.807 --> 32:56.975
OK, we have a Cezanne
at the gallery on Woodbine,

32:57.043 --> 32:58.944
I have a Munch at the AGO--
that's 10 minutes out.

32:59.011 --> 33:00.546
Hey, right here. This.

33:00.613 --> 33:03.080
I saw this when I read Whelan.

33:03.148 --> 33:07.151
It's a Gaugin.
It's worth close to 40 million.

33:07.218 --> 33:10.488
- That's at Bartholdi's Auction House
in Yorkville. Let's go. - Wait, a minute, no.

33:10.556 --> 33:12.957
- I also saw it when I read Manny.
- When was that?

33:13.024 --> 33:15.993
When we first brought him in. I didn't
think anything of it. It was so quick.

33:16.061 --> 33:18.294
So Manny knew they were gonna
hit this place the whole time?

33:18.362 --> 33:21.665
I can't say that for sure, but if he lied
about this, what else did he lie about?

33:21.732 --> 33:24.233
Michelle could be in a lot
more danger than we thought.

33:24.301 --> 33:27.604
I'm calling Klein.

33:31.442 --> 33:34.142
- [Whelan]: Six minutes.
- Too much power too fast,

33:34.210 --> 33:36.178
this place gets louder
than a Metallica concert.

33:36.245 --> 33:40.082
Give her time. She has as much
to lose as we do.

33:53.829 --> 33:55.329
After you.

34:00.736 --> 34:03.471
<i>Your instincts are right.</i>
<i>This guy's making moves</i>

34:03.539 --> 34:06.607
we couldn't have possibly have predicted.
<i>Get in there and take down Whelan.</i>

34:06.674 --> 34:09.141
- I could use some backup.
- I'll take care of it.

34:12.947 --> 34:16.216
- Whoa. What do you think you're doing?
- Years of driving an ambulance.

34:44.010 --> 34:46.077
Stop.

34:46.145 --> 34:48.212
Don't take another step.

34:54.385 --> 34:55.819
Nice catch.

34:55.887 --> 34:58.155
Can you shut it down?

35:17.840 --> 35:19.775
Guess that's a yes.

35:40.161 --> 35:42.129
Ain't she a beauty?

35:42.197 --> 35:44.699
Looks like it's your time
to shine, Bashful.

35:48.169 --> 35:50.103
[Michelle]: Wait.

35:50.170 --> 35:54.273
There's no plates
on the frame. Just the glass.

35:54.341 --> 35:57.944
Each piece is
individually armed.

35:58.012 --> 36:00.080
You losing your touch, Manny?

36:02.416 --> 36:05.418
[Whelan]: All right, we take
the Gaugin, we leave the rest.

36:05.486 --> 36:07.753
I'm gonna head to the office,
loop the security cam footage,

36:07.821 --> 36:11.456
make it look like we were never here.
Be done by the time I get back.

36:17.797 --> 36:20.633
Both hands on the wheel now!
Toby.

36:20.700 --> 36:23.635
Yeah. Whoa.
Whoa. Hey.

36:23.702 --> 36:25.837
He's got a nasty crack
on the head.

36:28.607 --> 36:31.709
His pulse is strong. He's gonna live,
but he's gonna have a nasty headache.

36:39.150 --> 36:41.084
IIB. You two are with us.

36:41.152 --> 36:43.787
There's more units on the way,
ETA 10 minutes.

36:43.855 --> 36:47.691
Well, we're going in now. You two stay with me.
I'll explain as we go.

36:47.759 --> 36:51.928
You missed your calling.

36:51.996 --> 36:54.797
- You ever want a career change...
- Done.

37:01.938 --> 37:04.106
I wasn't sure you were gonna
be able to pull that one off.

37:04.174 --> 37:06.441
What, are you questioning
my abilities now?

37:06.509 --> 37:08.644
I've been questioning
a lot of things.

37:08.712 --> 37:12.480
For example, how I ended up
with a cop on my crew.

37:18.283 --> 37:20.218
Take that painting out
and get it prepped for travel.

37:20.285 --> 37:22.151
Now!

37:24.322 --> 37:26.256
I don't know what you think

37:26.324 --> 37:28.991
- you know here, but--
- Allow me to fill you in.

37:29.059 --> 37:31.194
New crew member comes in,

37:31.262 --> 37:33.896
perfect résumé--tends
to get me a little nervous.

37:33.964 --> 37:37.867
So I sent a decoy van around to
Simons Gallery, and guess what?

37:37.935 --> 37:41.104
- The cops were all over it.
- And what does that prove exactly?

37:41.171 --> 37:43.873
Somebody on this crew tipped
them off.

37:43.941 --> 37:46.809
It doesn't take a genius
to narrow it down from there.

37:52.116 --> 37:54.916
- We're done.
- I'll deal with you later.

37:54.984 --> 37:58.220
As for you, Happy,
you've outlived your usefulness.

37:58.287 --> 38:00.521
- Drop your weapon now!
- Ugh!

38:07.663 --> 38:11.733
- You OK?
- Yeah. I'm good. What took you guys?

38:11.800 --> 38:13.334
We were enjoying the show.

38:15.804 --> 38:18.406
If you'd all be so kind
as to lower your weapons.

38:21.143 --> 38:24.612
- Where'd you get the piece from?
- I'm a resourceful guy.

38:24.680 --> 38:28.382
- Come on, Manny, don't blow it.
- I was serious before.

38:28.449 --> 38:31.818
If you ever get tired of being a
chronic do-gooder, you look me up, OK?

38:31.886 --> 38:34.020
Move.
Toward the door.

38:34.088 --> 38:35.756
Slowly.

38:35.823 --> 38:38.325
There's nowhere to run.
The cops are swarming outside.

38:38.393 --> 38:39.926
You're a terrible liar.

38:42.696 --> 38:44.930
You have a guy waiting
on the outside.

38:44.998 --> 38:49.101
But how did you know what gallery we were hitting?
Unless you knew the whole time.

38:49.169 --> 38:51.003
No, I never told him.

38:53.774 --> 38:55.974
You're Carnicero.

38:56.042 --> 38:58.010
This was interesting, Michelle.

38:58.077 --> 39:00.345
Let's do it again.

39:00.413 --> 39:02.113
Soon.

39:02.181 --> 39:04.683
Get down!

39:04.750 --> 39:09.086
(Alarms going off)

39:18.896 --> 39:24.201
Oz? I just talked to Carl.
What were you thinking?

39:24.268 --> 39:27.571
I don't know.
I got so drunk with power,

39:27.639 --> 39:29.206
I mean... That's it!

39:29.273 --> 39:31.674
As soon as Ryder hears about
this, that's it for me ever

39:31.742 --> 39:35.578
- being a supervisor.
- It's taken care of. - What do you mean?

39:35.646 --> 39:38.681
I told him I'd have coffee with him
if he promised not to report you.

39:38.749 --> 39:41.283
Oh! Thank you!
Oh, my God.

39:41.352 --> 39:44.387
But there is a condition.

39:44.455 --> 39:47.956
Close the investigation. One creepy coffee
date is enough, thank you very much.

39:48.023 --> 39:51.092
Consider it closed. You do admit
that he was creepy, though?

39:51.160 --> 39:54.295
- Happy birthday, Tessa.
- Mr. Hibbard.

39:54.364 --> 39:56.698
Do you know what time it is?
It is very late.

39:56.766 --> 39:59.534
- You should be in bed.
- But I have a surprise for you.

39:59.602 --> 40:04.037
Something very special
that I found just for you.

40:05.940 --> 40:08.041
Uh, Liv.

40:08.109 --> 40:11.044
I think I know
where the bracelet went.

40:14.148 --> 40:18.518
Wow. That is some serious bling.
He's a keeper.

40:18.586 --> 40:21.153
Do you like it, Tessa?

40:28.863 --> 40:31.731
It's beautiful, Kevin.

40:31.799 --> 40:34.166
Thank you.

40:41.307 --> 40:43.776
I am going to bring this back
to Mrs. Slatterly.

40:43.843 --> 40:45.677
Thanks, Oz. Nice job.

40:53.452 --> 40:56.387
You have a good night.

41:05.898 --> 41:08.932
- OK, where are we at?
- Manny's picture's in the hands

41:08.999 --> 41:11.868
of every department and agency--
local and international.

41:11.936 --> 41:14.538
We've also put surveillance
on Valla Florian.

41:14.605 --> 41:17.206
He won't go back to his old
plan. He's too smart for that.

41:17.274 --> 41:21.244
- What about this car of his?
- We're working with Interpol to try to track it down,

41:21.312 --> 41:24.179
but the plates were registered
to a fake name. - "Mariposa."

41:24.247 --> 41:26.782
- That's Spanish.
- "Butterfly."

41:26.850 --> 41:28.851
Butterfly.

41:28.919 --> 41:31.854
That's his sister's nickname.
The son of a bitch was

41:31.922 --> 41:34.256
practically flaunting it
in my face.

41:34.324 --> 41:36.325
Hey, you should all be proud
of yourselves.

41:36.392 --> 41:39.761
Whelan isn't exactly small potatoes.
He's offering to hand us

41:39.829 --> 41:42.497
a warehouse full of stolen art
in exchange for leniency.

41:42.565 --> 41:45.766
I had him. I had Carnicero
and I just let him go.

41:45.834 --> 41:49.503
