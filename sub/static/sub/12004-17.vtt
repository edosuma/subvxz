00:00.271 --> 00:01.757
<i>Previously on "Switched at birth"...</i>

00:01.757 --> 00:03.866
You never told us that Ty enlisted.

00:05.051 --> 00:07.172
And by putting you on the basketball team,

00:07.172 --> 00:10.130
Buckner qualifies for a $20,000 grant.

00:10.130 --> 00:12.817
So the only reason that
they wanted me on the team

00:12.817 --> 00:14.450
was because I'm deaf?

00:16.000 --> 00:22.074

00:24.637 --> 00:27.305
- You're moving out?
- I think we both need a break.

00:27.575 --> 00:30.000
- Hey, Daphne.
- This is Monica.

00:30.000 --> 00:32.842
- I know her from...
- They told us we could change in here.

00:32.842 --> 00:35.229
- Who did?
- I didn't steal your watch.

00:36.761 --> 00:38.378
Stop it! Cut it out!

00:38.378 --> 00:39.958
Hey! What the hell is going on?

00:46.509 --> 00:49.283
I think we just set some
sort of record for suicides.

00:49.283 --> 00:52.293
Those weren't suicides.
That was attempted murder.

00:52.293 --> 00:55.543
Listen up! Now despite all
the chatter on the court,

00:55.576 --> 00:57.676
this practice was not my
way of punishing you all

00:57.710 --> 00:59.710
for Saturday's loss to Oaks Glen.

00:59.742 --> 01:02.509
It's my way of getting us ready
for the playoffs, which means

01:02.543 --> 01:04.842
I'm shaking up the starting line-up.
No positions are a lock.

01:04.875 --> 01:05.953
We'll be scrimmaging,

01:05.954 --> 01:08.676
running drills and facing
off in one-on-one contests.

01:09.842 --> 01:12.476
He's making us play each
other to see who starts.

01:12.509 --> 01:14.238
This is great, this could be your chance!

01:14.238 --> 01:16.591
Here's the list of match-ups.
We'll start Wednesday.

01:25.855 --> 01:26.981
So?

01:27.324 --> 01:29.446
I'm going up against Ava for point guard.

01:29.446 --> 01:32.539
And you are going up against
Jenna for small forward.

01:33.195 --> 01:34.237
Jenna?

01:34.657 --> 01:36.349
Nobody's better at posting up than she is.

01:36.349 --> 01:39.360
Hey, we are both going to
be in that starting line-up.

01:40.305 --> 01:41.521
Thanks.

01:41.521 --> 01:44.769
I am serious, Daphne.
We will practice as much as you need.

01:45.081 --> 01:47.226
You don't know me...
I'm like a dog with a bone

01:47.226 --> 01:48.210
when I want something.

01:48.865 --> 01:52.470
- And you want me to start with you?
- Absolutely.

01:52.470 --> 01:53.971
You're my girl.

01:58.788 --> 02:02.274
I'm sorry we fought the other day.

02:02.274 --> 02:04.328
It's just that everything

02:04.328 --> 02:07.116
with Angelo was exploding

02:07.116 --> 02:10.339
and I think I may have

02:10.339 --> 02:11.878
Taken it out on you.

02:17.214 --> 02:20.540
Wow, you just polished off like
a vineyard-worth of grapes.

02:22.038 --> 02:25.091
Oh hi, Emmett.

02:25.669 --> 02:27.159
It's nice to see you.

02:27.159 --> 02:28.169
Hi, sweetheart.

02:29.187 --> 02:31.880
Oh, to have the metabolism
of a 17-year-old boy.

02:32.057 --> 02:34.647
I don't think he's eaten
a lot of meals lately.

02:35.395 --> 02:38.361
You know what? Let me
make you something good.

02:38.361 --> 02:40.490
How about some rosemary-garlic chicken?

02:40.490 --> 02:42.468
Just takes 15 minutes.

02:42.971 --> 02:45.042
No no no, he's fine. You're fine, right?

02:45.042 --> 02:46.358
You don't want anything.

02:47.875 --> 02:49.226
I saw that.

02:50.660 --> 02:53.399
One rosemary-garlic chicken coming up!

02:54.527 --> 02:56.690
So, Emmett, what's new? How's school?

03:08.186 --> 03:09.500
Family...

03:10.602 --> 03:11.479
He has a lot of homework

03:11.479 --> 03:14.488
- and he has to take a family portrait.
- I saw. I get it.

03:17.441 --> 03:19.259
Can't use your family because...

03:22.184 --> 03:25.220
I'm sorry. I didn't know
things were that bad.

03:26.761 --> 03:29.294
- Me neither.
- You know, Emmett,

03:29.294 --> 03:31.909
we could use a new family portrait

03:31.909 --> 03:34.572
because we don't have one with Daphne

03:34.572 --> 03:36.683
- and Regina. Do you think maybe...
- No.

03:36.683 --> 03:39.546
- Use our family for your assignment?
- No no no no no.

03:39.546 --> 03:43.172
Huh-uh! No. She's just using
this as a way to get to know you.

03:43.172 --> 03:44.146
No.

03:44.980 --> 03:46.567
- So?
- So...

03:46.567 --> 03:50.076
Fine, there's always
"Sound of music" night.

03:51.028 --> 03:52.681
He'd make a great Kurt.

03:52.681 --> 03:54.551
Okay okay okay... family portrait.

03:57.025 --> 03:59.700
Family portrait.

04:15.755 --> 04:17.341
So? What do you think?

04:17.582 --> 04:19.846
Nice. What do you call this? Bedhead?

04:19.846 --> 04:22.039
Whatever it is, I appreciate your vision.

04:22.807 --> 04:23.773
And thank you.

04:23.773 --> 04:25.735
I appreciate you calling it a vision.

04:25.735 --> 04:29.230
When you deal with artists all day
it becomes an essential part of your vocabulary.

04:29.230 --> 04:30.774
Artists. What do you do?

04:30.864 --> 04:32.943
I just opened a gallery
at the crossroads... medium west.

04:32.944 --> 04:35.637
- Oh, fancy.
- I'm going for edgy.

04:36.038 --> 04:39.936
Oh, then you should
check out the fringe festival.

04:40.155 --> 04:42.241
Last year some guy shaved his head,

04:42.241 --> 04:46.196
set the hair on fire and then
** the ashes back onto his head.

04:46.196 --> 04:48.345
Okay, that's the kind of
thing that gives both artists

04:48.345 --> 04:50.310
and hair transplants a bad name.

04:50.854 --> 04:52.888
But I'll check it out.
I love finding new artists.

04:52.888 --> 04:55.284
Um, I'm sure you get this all the time,

04:55.284 --> 04:57.985
but would you be willing to
meet with a young artist?

04:57.985 --> 05:00.067
Maybe give some advice or feedback?

05:00.067 --> 05:01.815
Does he show at a gallery here in town?

05:02.199 --> 05:04.495
She is not with anyone right now.

05:04.495 --> 05:07.016
Her name is Bay Kennish. She's my daughter

05:07.016 --> 05:10.032
but just so you don't think I'm some
proud mom pimping out her daughter...

05:10.032 --> 05:14.174
I mean, I am proud,
but she really is talented.

05:14.318 --> 05:16.600
This is a mural she just did.

05:18.010 --> 05:21.204
Wow, kind of a chicano-socialist vibe.

05:21.460 --> 05:22.455
I like it.

05:22.455 --> 05:24.843
I would be happy to check out her studio,

05:25.168 --> 05:27.344
- see what else she's done.
- And you're not just saying that

05:27.344 --> 05:29.428
because I'm the one with the scissors?

05:30.295 --> 05:31.355
No.

05:32.608 --> 05:34.647
But people are interested, honey.

05:34.647 --> 05:37.163
Mom, no one is gonna read
your book to find out

05:37.163 --> 05:39.234
how Toby Kennish is
dealing with the switch.

05:39.234 --> 05:42.859
It's about all of us.
How one family was turned upside down

05:42.859 --> 05:44.755
and still managed to land on its feet.

05:45.684 --> 05:47.989
That's a line from my book proposal.

05:48.035 --> 05:50.147
- When do I get to read that?
- When it's done.

05:50.336 --> 05:53.613
Not to be a nudge, but you should get that
to the publishers sooner than later.

05:53.613 --> 05:56.300
I know, I know, I know.
Sarah Lazar is probably writing away

05:56.300 --> 05:59.696
but I'm not gonna race just
to beat her it has to be right.

05:59.696 --> 06:03.304
Honey, I'm just trying to help.
And what happened to all of our food?

06:03.304 --> 06:04.963
Uh, okay.

06:05.177 --> 06:07.796
Toby, what's the biggest
change you've experienced

06:07.796 --> 06:09.050
since you found out about the switch?

06:09.050 --> 06:10.864
And how has it changed you?

06:11.646 --> 06:12.639
I don't know.

06:13.505 --> 06:16.400
The only thing I can think
of is that with all the drama

06:16.400 --> 06:19.217
it's kinda allowed me
to fly under the radar.

06:21.547 --> 06:23.673
Have we been ignoring you, honey?

06:24.208 --> 06:25.701
It's just you guys have
had a lot on your plate.

06:25.701 --> 06:27.028
I didn't want to add to that.

06:28.104 --> 06:29.812
We should do something...
just the three of us...

06:29.812 --> 06:33.768
Like go to the science museum or...
skeet shooting.

06:33.768 --> 06:35.388
You always loved skeet shooting, honey.

06:35.388 --> 06:37.890
- So we can...
- Let me just re-phrase my answer.

06:37.890 --> 06:39.457
When we first found out about the switch,

06:39.457 --> 06:40.948
I was questioning everything.

06:40.948 --> 06:43.606
It was like I was living
on quicksand, but now,

06:43.606 --> 06:47.720
thanks to my very attentive parents,
I'm back on solid ground.

06:48.938 --> 06:51.180
- You're not getting out of this.
- You're welcome.

06:52.320 --> 06:54.957
I think it was Bay who
was into skeet shooting.

06:58.587 --> 07:00.394
I look like a ho.

07:00.606 --> 07:03.706
What are you talking about?
You look awesome!

07:03.706 --> 07:08.483
You have got to stop with
the stripes and the orange.

07:08.895 --> 07:11.070
First of all, it's persimmon.

07:11.316 --> 07:13.908
- And I like the stripes.
- You've got these adorable arms

07:13.908 --> 07:16.794
that you hide in cardigans
all the time. It's crazy.

07:17.818 --> 07:19.719
Hello...

07:19.778 --> 07:21.229
- Hi!
- Hey, mom.

07:21.617 --> 07:24.586
I'm Simone. I've heard so much about you!

07:24.586 --> 07:26.668
Uh, Regina. Hi.

07:28.684 --> 07:31.354
- Wow.
- It's Simone's.

07:31.354 --> 07:33.980
Yeah, I figured.

07:33.980 --> 07:36.397
Doesn't she look amazing? You know what?

07:36.397 --> 07:38.059
You would look amazing in that too.

07:38.059 --> 07:40.842
Your mom has a killer bod!
I would die for your boobs.

07:42.124 --> 07:42.916
Thank you.

07:42.916 --> 07:44.870
And I love what
you've done with the place!

07:44.870 --> 07:47.887
Thank god you got rid of all
those squirrels. Yikes, right?

07:49.172 --> 07:51.744
Yeah, it just wasn't me.

07:54.501 --> 07:57.105
Um, do you want to stay for dinner?

07:57.105 --> 07:59.094
I totally would, but I gotta run.

07:59.094 --> 08:02.153
I've got a wax at 5:00.
I'll see you tomorrow, right, Daphne?

08:02.173 --> 08:04.622
Okay. It was really nice to meet you,

08:04.622 --> 08:06.647
and seriously, keep the dress.

08:33.409 --> 08:34.894
I just wanted to show you

08:34.894 --> 08:37.837
a few examples of what
we've done in the past.

08:41.467 --> 08:44.657
That was Bay before she figured
out how to use a hair dryer.

08:45.740 --> 08:48.461
This is when Toby fell on the playground

08:48.461 --> 08:50.366
and cut his face up so we all dressed up

08:50.366 --> 08:53.506
like pirates with bloody scars to match.

08:54.649 --> 08:58.239
"You guys are really cute."

08:58.239 --> 08:59.484
Thank you.

09:00.995 --> 09:03.611
But now we are in your hands this time.

09:04.562 --> 09:07.664
I know that you're going
to want to do something

09:07.664 --> 09:09.399
a little more arty than...

09:10.032 --> 09:11.577
and the whole point of the

09:11.577 --> 09:14.387
assignment is to say something
about family, right?

09:14.387 --> 09:16.127
This family, so...

09:17.185 --> 09:19.986
"Don't worry about my assignment."

09:20.497 --> 09:24.097
"I want to take a good photo..."

09:24.532 --> 09:25.557
for me.

09:26.950 --> 09:29.056
Thank you. Okay.

09:30.574 --> 09:34.666
I know I'm going to get in huge trouble

09:34.666 --> 09:36.990
if I ask you anything personal,

09:36.990 --> 09:38.156
but I...

09:41.054 --> 09:42.580
She's not here,

09:43.450 --> 09:44.679
so ask you.

09:46.346 --> 09:49.609
Okay. Have you ever dated...

09:52.714 --> 09:56.350
dated a hearing girl before?

09:56.727 --> 09:57.781
No.

09:57.781 --> 10:01.075
And you didn't date Daphne, right?

10:02.123 --> 10:04.465
"Just friends."

10:06.470 --> 10:08.008
I was never very comfortable

10:08.008 --> 10:11.315
with Bay's old boyfriend.

10:12.460 --> 10:15.173
Ty... whew. You know Ty?

10:16.222 --> 10:18.999
I feel a little guilty saying this,

10:18.999 --> 10:22.577
but I was relieved when he left.

10:23.913 --> 10:27.597
But Bay was just so sad

10:27.806 --> 10:30.243
and her heart was broken.

10:31.587 --> 10:33.598
And then you... you came along.

10:34.930 --> 10:36.294
Thank god.

10:41.566 --> 10:44.798
He is coming by
to see some of my stuff.

10:45.040 --> 10:47.981
The problem is I can't figure
out what I should show him.

10:47.981 --> 10:50.407
Uh... oh, this one...

10:50.853 --> 10:53.947
This one people really like.

10:54.225 --> 10:56.041
But that could mean that it's too obvious.

10:56.982 --> 11:01.707
This one... yeah? I could
really talk about this one,

11:01.707 --> 11:05.187
but sometimes curators like
the piece to speak for itself.

11:07.734 --> 11:11.826
It would be amazing to have
something in a real gallery.

11:11.826 --> 11:15.835
You know? With real
artists appreciating it.

11:15.835 --> 11:18.030
There'd be an opening and reviews!

11:21.170 --> 11:22.202
Well, hello, buzzkill.

11:25.881 --> 11:29.380
I know that people see my street art,

11:29.380 --> 11:30.740
but it's anonymous.

11:30.740 --> 11:32.317
Which I love but...

11:32.759 --> 11:36.666
sometimes I would like to
be known as something other

11:36.666 --> 11:39.432
than the girl who was switched at birth.

11:42.149 --> 11:43.517
Are you okay?

11:44.990 --> 11:47.160
Did my mom say something?

11:47.306 --> 11:49.875
She did. She totally did.

11:51.095 --> 11:51.897
No, what did she say?

12:01.546 --> 12:03.068
Hey, c'mere!

12:05.140 --> 12:07.534
What's up? What's so
urgent about this practice?

12:07.794 --> 12:10.542
I hired Lotte Macomb to coach us.

12:11.848 --> 12:12.945
Holy crap.

12:13.853 --> 12:15.518
The one who played for Stanford?

12:15.518 --> 12:17.405
And who coaches at U.M.K.C.

12:17.405 --> 12:20.014
If anyone can teach
you how to post-up, it's her.

12:21.164 --> 12:24.095
I... you seriously hired her to coach us?

12:24.095 --> 12:25.847
We have her for three hours.

12:26.029 --> 12:29.531
That is so cool,

12:30.106 --> 12:33.528
but I don't think I can help
split the cost with you.

12:33.528 --> 12:35.345
Dude, not to worry. I got it covered.

12:35.345 --> 12:37.868
- Simone, that's...
- Seriously, don't worry about it.

12:37.868 --> 12:40.092
Remember that watch that
I thought had been stolen?

12:40.092 --> 12:42.286
I found it in my leather jacket.
And my dad had already

12:42.286 --> 12:46.291
bought a new one so I sold it
and voilÃ ... private lessons.

12:47.604 --> 12:49.899
Well, do you think we
should tell coach Medlock?

12:49.899 --> 12:51.841
I mean, everybody thinks

12:51.841 --> 12:53.597
those girls from East Riverside stole it.

12:53.597 --> 12:56.287
We were the ones who got
in trouble, not them.

12:56.806 --> 13:00.510
C'mon, we are wasting valuable
Lotte Macomb coaching time.

13:00.510 --> 13:01.739
Let's go!

13:12.312 --> 13:14.340
- Hey.
- Hi.

13:15.000 --> 13:17.300
So you know I'm doing the hit-fest

13:17.300 --> 13:19.730
for the flintport animal shelter tomorrow?

13:20.017 --> 13:23.161
- Yeah?
- And I was thinking maybe you'd like to come with me.

13:24.478 --> 13:28.028
I got a solo gig at this
thing called Treads & Threads

13:28.491 --> 13:32.579
and, um, I need to practice for that.

13:33.219 --> 13:35.645
C'mon, you can play guitar anytime.

13:36.558 --> 13:39.272
Actually, dad, it's kind of important.

13:39.272 --> 13:41.687
Yeah well, hit-fest is kind of important.

13:43.232 --> 13:46.617
Toby, the puppies of flintport need you.

13:47.817 --> 13:49.416
C'mon, it'll be fun.

13:49.746 --> 13:51.795
You and me on the baseball diamond...

13:52.181 --> 13:53.846
it's been awhile, huh?

13:55.132 --> 13:56.455
Okay.

13:58.758 --> 14:00.738
So this one was inspired by Miro.

14:00.860 --> 14:03.708
I can see that. Nice work.

14:04.213 --> 14:05.529
Thanks.

14:06.486 --> 14:07.909
And this one,

14:07.909 --> 14:10.731
I was kind of playing with the idea

14:10.731 --> 14:13.782
of what's text versus what's an image.

14:15.493 --> 14:17.780
See the m-a-n?

14:18.317 --> 14:19.974
Kind of a twist on Jenny Holzer.

14:19.974 --> 14:22.661
- Right!
- I can't believe you even used me

14:22.661 --> 14:25.073
in the same sentence. I love her.

14:25.073 --> 14:27.444
I showed a couple of her
pieces back in New York.

14:27.444 --> 14:29.137
I'll bring you by a catalog from the show.

14:29.137 --> 14:30.646
Oh my god. That would be amazing.

14:30.844 --> 14:32.948
This is definitely one
of my favorite pieces.

14:33.646 --> 14:36.253
Have you ever considered representing
artists? You're very good.

14:36.786 --> 14:39.234
Bay's work does not need a rep.
It sells itself.

14:40.676 --> 14:42.887
- Nice.
- You should probably go

14:42.887 --> 14:45.235
before she starts bragging about
the doodles on my notebooks.

14:45.235 --> 14:48.039
Those aren't just doodles.
Those are abstract sketches.

14:51.397 --> 14:54.872
- She's clearly passionate.
- And?

14:54.872 --> 14:56.347
And very talented.

14:56.347 --> 14:58.572
That's an impressive body
of work for a 16-year-old.

14:58.572 --> 15:00.837
She paints almost every waking moment.

15:01.252 --> 15:02.495
So I'm still trying to figure out

15:02.495 --> 15:05.129
where I can find some authentic
Kansas City barbecue.

15:05.129 --> 15:06.507
Oh, there are so many!

15:06.772 --> 15:09.625
My favorite is a hole-in-the-wall
called Alabama Al's.

15:09.625 --> 15:12.834
There's also Jack Stack.
You gotta get the cheesy corn.

15:13.678 --> 15:15.246
And I'm also trying to figure out

15:15.309 --> 15:16.696
who I can share it with.

15:17.534 --> 15:19.187
Oh, um...

15:19.187 --> 15:22.247
I... I have to check my work schedule.

15:22.685 --> 15:25.328
Is that code for you're seeing somebody

15:25.328 --> 15:26.766
or otherwise entangled?

15:29.232 --> 15:31.953
Nope. No entanglements at all.

15:32.463 --> 15:33.782
Okay.

15:33.960 --> 15:35.769
I'll consider it a date.

16:03.438 --> 16:05.471
Okay, all right, here we go.

16:17.318 --> 16:19.878
- Great job, dad.
- Thank you. You're up.

16:20.041 --> 16:21.602
- What?
- I'm not doing this by myself.

16:21.602 --> 16:24.126
My boy Toby's going to take some swings.

16:24.126 --> 16:26.782
- Come on, let's go.
- No...

16:27.168 --> 16:28.819
- Okay.
- All right.

16:29.358 --> 16:31.930
All right, slow that
machine down for him now.

17:01.399 --> 17:04.347
Hi. Sorry, I just have to
get my phone. Come on in.

17:05.029 --> 17:08.945
Take your time. Wow, nice place.

17:08.945 --> 17:10.998
Oh yeah, it's not really mine.

17:10.998 --> 17:12.643
Hello?

17:13.499 --> 17:15.473
Oh, hello.

17:15.473 --> 17:18.957
I left that blue peacoat here
and it's starting to get chilly.

17:18.957 --> 17:20.730
Mom, this is Patrick.

17:20.730 --> 17:22.742
Patrick, this is my mom Adrianna.

17:22.742 --> 17:24.740
- Nice to meet you.
- You too.

17:24.740 --> 17:27.451
- I'm sorry I interrupted.
- No, mom, you're not.

17:27.451 --> 17:29.006
You're never interrupting.

17:29.692 --> 17:31.493
Patrick is opening
a gallery at the crossroads

17:31.493 --> 17:33.227
and I wanted him to see Bay's work.

17:33.260 --> 17:35.566
Oh, Bay's so talented. And Regina too.

17:35.566 --> 17:37.417
- Did she show you any of her work?
- Ma, please.

17:37.552 --> 17:39.008
- You're an artist too?
- No.

17:39.678 --> 17:41.050
I dabbled back in the day.

17:41.050 --> 17:43.351
She more than dabbled. Look at this.

17:44.247 --> 17:45.975
It's filled with her artwork.

17:45.975 --> 17:47.427
- I'm so sorry.
- It's okay.

17:47.427 --> 17:49.300
I'm used to mom's pimping their daughters.

17:50.593 --> 17:52.626
See how the colors change?

17:52.626 --> 17:54.571
And look how it catches the light.

17:54.908 --> 17:57.013
This is a strong piece.

17:58.571 --> 18:00.522
Are these shards of glass?

18:02.474 --> 18:05.259
- Yeah.
- Anyway I should get that coat.

18:05.259 --> 18:07.523
Mom... um, Patrick,

18:07.523 --> 18:09.444
would you mind waiting
outside for just a second?

18:09.444 --> 18:11.034
Oh, of course not.

18:11.034 --> 18:13.120
Nice meeting you, Adrianna.

18:15.499 --> 18:17.863
Mom, I'm so sorry.

18:17.863 --> 18:21.690
No, I'm sorry. Maybe I overstepped
by calling about Angelo.

18:21.690 --> 18:23.661
Okay, let's just move on.

18:24.184 --> 18:27.751
I lost my temper and I miss you.

18:29.017 --> 18:32.117
Daphne misses you. Would you...

18:32.804 --> 18:33.934
move back?

18:35.556 --> 18:37.586
Do you really think I needed that coat?

18:38.980 --> 18:40.054
C'mere.

18:46.110 --> 18:47.495
Damn. Heads up.

18:48.760 --> 18:51.169
Hey, Monica. What's up?

18:51.282 --> 18:53.478
Didn't you hear? We've been banned.

18:54.290 --> 18:56.248
Banned? What do you mean?

18:56.761 --> 18:58.192
We're not allowed to practice here anymore

18:58.192 --> 19:00.912
since someone accused us
of stealing a watch.

19:01.473 --> 19:02.589
But...

19:04.103 --> 19:05.845
Uh, where are you practicing now?

19:05.845 --> 19:07.884
I don't know. All the private
schools are freaked out,

19:07.884 --> 19:10.102
thinking we're a bunch
of thugs and thieves.

19:10.248 --> 19:11.983
We're just screwed, I guess.

19:15.135 --> 19:17.431
I'm really sorry about all this.

19:18.610 --> 19:20.740
Whatever. Not your problem.

19:22.009 --> 19:23.157
See you around.

19:29.036 --> 19:30.492
We have to tell someone.

19:30.748 --> 19:31.954
Tell someone what?

19:33.030 --> 19:34.916
That you found your watch.

19:34.916 --> 19:37.207
Daphne, don't you remember
how pissed coach got

19:37.207 --> 19:38.969
when we accused those girls?

19:38.969 --> 19:41.354
He'll just get mad again
and take it out on us.

19:41.354 --> 19:43.154
And we're not exactly in a position

19:43.154 --> 19:46.539
to be on his bad side.
Besides, the damage is done.

19:46.739 --> 19:49.050
But we can undo it. If those girls don't

19:49.050 --> 19:50.987
have a place to practice,
they can't compete.

19:50.987 --> 19:54.312
- They'll find somewhere.
- Simone.

19:54.312 --> 19:55.930
I'm not telling coach.

19:55.930 --> 19:59.228
It was our bad and it's over. Let it go.

20:00.390 --> 20:01.618
If you don't tell him...

20:01.939 --> 20:03.823
If I don't tell him, what?

20:04.893 --> 20:07.806
I'm serious, Daphne. Let it go.

20:24.215 --> 20:25.491
Hey.

20:28.797 --> 20:30.537
Can I ask you something?

20:30.828 --> 20:34.418
What happened between you and Simone,
can you just tell me?

20:34.418 --> 20:36.430
Uh, it's kinda long.

20:36.842 --> 20:38.115
Please.

20:44.601 --> 20:48.131
In eighth grade there was this girl,

20:48.131 --> 20:49.761
Alisha Jelline.

20:50.577 --> 20:52.832
She wore these weird barrettes

20:52.832 --> 20:57.099
by her ears and her uniform was
like way longer than her knees.

20:58.422 --> 21:02.297
Simone, uh, convinced me

21:02.297 --> 21:04.818
that we should give her a makeover.

21:04.851 --> 21:06.691
This girl let you?

21:07.751 --> 21:11.083
She was desperate to be friends with us.

21:11.805 --> 21:12.996
And then what?

21:14.918 --> 21:18.117
And then we asked her who she liked.

21:18.763 --> 21:20.669
It took awhile to get it
out of her, but it was

21:20.669 --> 21:24.449
this hockey player Tim Burke.

21:25.460 --> 21:26.912
And we

21:28.016 --> 21:32.040
convinced her that she should
practice asking him out

21:32.040 --> 21:33.636
and film it.

21:34.697 --> 21:36.233
You didn't.

21:36.540 --> 21:39.780
Alisha told the camera how
cute she thought he was,

21:39.780 --> 21:41.666
how sexy,

21:41.666 --> 21:45.628
how she thought about him all the time.

21:45.962 --> 21:48.976
It was humiliating to
watch even in private.

21:48.976 --> 21:51.971
And I begged Simone to delete it

21:51.971 --> 21:53.559
after Alisha left.

21:54.965 --> 21:58.369
- But...
- She sent it around anyway.

21:58.369 --> 22:02.636
It jumped from school to school.
I think the whole city saw it.

22:04.698 --> 22:07.355
And Alisha left a month later.

22:08.884 --> 22:12.184
I never should've let Simone
talk me into doing it.

22:12.217 --> 22:15.184
I still feel sick when I think about it.

22:18.950 --> 22:22.017
And we never really

22:22.050 --> 22:24.150
hung out much after that.

22:26.017 --> 22:28.884
Uh...

22:29.503 --> 22:32.138
Simone Sinclair is not

22:32.138 --> 22:34.035
someone you want as an enemy,

22:34.035 --> 22:37.906
but she's not really someone
you want as a friend either.

22:47.144 --> 22:49.356
I feel like we should go shoot
some shotguns after this,

22:49.356 --> 22:51.594
get the whole red-state tour.

22:51.594 --> 22:54.708
I hate guns, but I'm
actually a pretty good shot.

22:56.248 --> 22:58.956
- Why doesn't that surprise me?
- Oh, you have a little...

23:00.078 --> 23:02.875
Okay, so what did you
really think of Bay's work?

23:02.875 --> 23:04.066
I mean is she on the right track?

23:04.066 --> 23:07.078
She obviously has talent. She's just 16.

23:07.078 --> 23:07.810
I mean, there's only so

23:07.810 --> 23:09.852
many things you can
paint about at that age.

23:10.115 --> 23:12.644
You think she'll be able to
make a go of it as an artist?

23:12.644 --> 23:15.820
Yeah, someday. She just needs more time.

23:15.820 --> 23:18.673
Most curators... or at least myself...
I'm looking for artists

23:18.673 --> 23:20.740
that have something unique to say...

23:21.776 --> 23:22.771
Okay.

23:23.748 --> 23:25.450
Like that painting of yours.

23:25.725 --> 23:27.884
It was clearly about
something pretty deep.

23:30.722 --> 23:32.290
I'm a recovering alcoholic

23:32.290 --> 23:34.489
and I painted that when
I was getting sober.

23:34.489 --> 23:35.744
The shards of glass in

23:35.744 --> 23:38.225
the painting are from
broken liquor bottles.

23:38.225 --> 23:41.983
That's what I'm talking about.
You went through something

23:42.017 --> 23:45.599
and it was all there on the canvas...
the pain, frustration,

23:45.599 --> 23:46.509
the light at the end of the tunnel.

23:46.509 --> 23:47.481
I was just trying to find

23:47.481 --> 23:49.364
something to do so I didn't drink again.

23:49.504 --> 23:51.579
- Do you want more baked beans?
- I'm serious.

23:51.579 --> 23:54.200
That painting would go great
in a show I'm putting together.

23:54.200 --> 23:55.986
It's all about turning points.

23:55.986 --> 23:57.774
I think it would really fit in well.

23:58.314 --> 24:01.600
I'm serious. Think about it.

24:07.904 --> 24:09.095
Come in.

24:11.136 --> 24:12.810
- Oh.
- Hey!

24:13.603 --> 24:15.002
I'm really glad you're home!

24:15.002 --> 24:17.558
So how'd it go?

24:17.558 --> 24:19.481
What did he say? I'm dying to hear.

24:19.481 --> 24:20.811
Should I call him? Should I email him?

24:20.811 --> 24:23.063
Should I send him... I was
thinking like this handmade card

24:23.063 --> 24:24.577
and I wanted to thank him for ever...

24:26.097 --> 24:27.330
What?

24:29.474 --> 24:31.896
He thinks that you are really talented.

24:32.397 --> 24:34.765
- He hated my stuff.
- No no no.

24:34.765 --> 24:37.592
Regina, I can walk across
the driveway for platitudes.

24:40.082 --> 24:42.026
He thought it was really impressive...

24:43.242 --> 24:47.336
- But?
- But you're 16.

24:48.869 --> 24:50.097
What does that mean?

24:50.731 --> 24:53.664
He felt like, you know,
maybe you hadn't figured out

24:53.697 --> 24:55.731
exactly what your work was trying to say.

24:55.763 --> 24:57.763
That's just 'cause he didn't ask me.

24:57.796 --> 24:59.097
We mostly talked about style...

24:59.130 --> 25:00.407
Honey, your stuff is way

25:00.408 --> 25:02.697
more sophisticated than
mine was in my 20s.

25:02.731 --> 25:04.664
So you agree with him.
For my age, it's good?

25:04.697 --> 25:06.796
No no! Oh god, okay.

25:06.830 --> 25:08.763
It's not coming out right.

25:08.796 --> 25:11.896
He thinks that you have a lot of promise.

25:11.930 --> 25:14.631
Look, this is just one man's opinion.

25:14.664 --> 25:15.963
- Right. No, I know.
- Bay.

25:15.997 --> 25:18.030
No! You know what? It's cool.

25:18.063 --> 25:21.763
At the end of the day
I appreciate honesty, so...

25:23.731 --> 25:24.997
thanks.

25:29.181 --> 25:30.987
So you missed the first few pitches.

25:31.172 --> 25:33.470
You slammed the last, like, five or six.

25:33.470 --> 25:35.336
It's not about my at-bat.

25:35.370 --> 25:37.503
It was watching you.

25:39.124 --> 25:40.560
I forgot how good you are.

25:41.139 --> 25:42.275
Thanks?

25:43.014 --> 25:45.244
I would have killed for
that kind of talent.

25:45.565 --> 25:46.924
You had that kind of talent.

25:46.924 --> 25:48.596
And I made a career out of it.

25:49.962 --> 25:51.170
Why'd you drop it?

25:52.361 --> 25:54.717
Dad, you pushed and you pushed.

25:55.106 --> 25:57.108
- You took all the fun out of it.
- Come on.

25:57.108 --> 25:58.924
I wanted you to reach your potential.

25:58.957 --> 26:02.857
No, dad, baseball was
always gonna be your thing.

26:02.857 --> 26:06.364
If I was ever any good,
it was because I was John Kennish's son.

26:06.364 --> 26:09.163
And if I wasn't, then it would
be a blemish on your legacy.

26:09.163 --> 26:11.588
- That is ridiculous.
- This is not about you.

26:11.588 --> 26:13.190
No, I am trying to talk to you

26:13.190 --> 26:15.548
about what you could have
done with all that talent.

26:15.548 --> 26:17.867
Seems to me like you threw
that away for nothing.

26:17.867 --> 26:20.505
Oh, that's right, dad. That's what I did.

26:20.505 --> 26:22.210
I threw it all away for nothing.

26:31.426 --> 26:34.137
I feel like I should tell you something.

26:34.225 --> 26:38.609
Simone's watch... the one
that she thought was stolen...

26:39.313 --> 26:41.600
it wasn't. It was just lost and...

26:41.600 --> 26:44.330
- And she found it.
- Yeah.

26:44.330 --> 26:47.330
Simone already told me. She also told me

26:47.330 --> 26:49.106
that you two sold
the watch and used the money

26:49.106 --> 26:51.492
to pay for a private
trainer for yourselves.

26:52.724 --> 26:56.161
- I had that same reaction.
- That's not what happened.

26:56.161 --> 26:57.911
Really? So you didn't use the money

26:57.911 --> 27:00.409
for a private session with
the coach from U.M.K.C.?

27:00.409 --> 27:02.336
Well, yes, but...

27:02.336 --> 27:04.765
And she did that, what?
Out of the goodness of her heart?

27:04.765 --> 27:05.936
No, but I didn't...

27:05.936 --> 27:07.530
I went out on a limb to
put you in this team,

27:07.530 --> 27:08.965
and I'm starting to
regret that decision.

27:08.965 --> 27:09.758
You put me on the team

27:09.758 --> 27:12.910
because I'm deaf and
the school gets disability funding.

27:19.052 --> 27:20.458
Y'know what?

27:21.698 --> 27:24.612
You're right. Let's start clean.

27:25.433 --> 27:28.308
- Okay.
- With this new round of tryouts,

27:28.308 --> 27:30.671
- it'll be all about your playing.
- Good.

27:30.671 --> 27:32.085
I'm ready for Jenna.

27:32.331 --> 27:34.787
Actually, I was thinking you'd
be a better point guard.

27:35.924 --> 27:38.317
So I'll be up against...

27:39.612 --> 27:42.027
- Simone.
- Is that a problem?

27:45.524 --> 27:46.646
No,

27:47.282 --> 27:48.663
not at all.

27:51.914 --> 27:54.536
- Regina.
- I'm all done. Thanks again.

27:55.360 --> 27:56.042
Any time.

27:56.991 --> 28:00.124
Bay just told me what happened
with your gallery friend.

28:00.579 --> 28:02.282
He's not exactly my friend.

28:02.282 --> 28:04.580
I'm just... I'm not sure
what you were you thinking.

28:04.896 --> 28:05.899
Excuse me?

28:06.013 --> 28:08.420
Why did you get her hopes up?
I mean, c'mon.

28:08.421 --> 28:10.145
What serious gallery is going

28:10.145 --> 28:12.487
to show the work of a high school student?

28:12.487 --> 28:14.374
I just wanted him to
take a look at her stuff.

28:14.374 --> 28:16.329
Feedback is good for artists.

28:16.329 --> 28:19.687
I didn't realize that she was
hoping he would show her.

28:19.687 --> 28:22.074
Well, she was. And she's devastated.

28:22.074 --> 28:24.907
You should have never invited
him over here like that.

28:24.941 --> 28:26.145
What, so we're never supposed

28:26.146 --> 28:27.974
to encourage her to
show her work to anyone?

28:28.008 --> 28:29.956
Of course not, but we could nurture her,

28:29.957 --> 28:31.680
build up her self-esteem.

28:32.054 --> 28:35.275
Kathryn, rejection hurts no matter
how good your self-esteem is

28:35.308 --> 28:38.941
and, unfortunately,
rejection is 99% of being an artist.

28:38.974 --> 28:40.070
So we should just throw

28:40.071 --> 28:42.074
her to the wolves now, teach her a lesson?

28:42.108 --> 28:44.885
She took a risk showing
her stuff to Patrick

28:44.885 --> 28:47.190
and even if he didn't
fall in love with it,

28:47.190 --> 28:48.911
she put herself out there.

28:48.911 --> 28:51.275
That's hard. And I am
proud of her for trying.

28:53.174 --> 28:55.241
Please don't use those dryer sheets!

28:55.275 --> 28:58.041
They ruin the machine.

29:07.074 --> 29:09.108
Hey, you came!

29:09.141 --> 29:12.341
How did you escape your dad and Olivia?

29:17.274 --> 29:19.482
So that art guy?

29:19.787 --> 29:21.870
He thinks that I don't
have anything to say,

29:21.870 --> 29:25.240
but I do. This is what I have to say...
my street art.

29:25.240 --> 29:28.946
So I'm going to put this up across
the street from his gallery.

29:31.757 --> 29:35.018
I don't care. I just... I want to show him

29:35.018 --> 29:37.143
or I want to show me or something.

29:37.143 --> 29:39.410
I don't know. But that's
the thing about street art.

29:39.443 --> 29:42.109
I don't need anybody's approval,

29:42.143 --> 29:46.209
I just put it out there
and I see what happens.

29:54.376 --> 29:58.042
Okay, what is going on?
You're officially being terse.

30:07.570 --> 30:11.336
Ty? Why are you asking me about Ty?

30:13.918 --> 30:16.954
My mom? I'm gonna kill her.
What did she say?

30:19.239 --> 30:20.351
No.

30:22.297 --> 30:25.557
I don't know. If we were,
it was for like a month at the most.

30:25.705 --> 30:27.640
What does it matter anyway?
He's half a world away.

30:31.170 --> 30:32.568
We didn't sleep together,

30:32.568 --> 30:35.894
which you know because
I told you I'm a vegetable.

30:37.150 --> 30:38.271
A virgin.

30:42.139 --> 30:45.688
I met him right as everything happened.

30:47.209 --> 30:49.543
He was somebody for me to talk to.

30:54.883 --> 30:58.150
He was somebody who was
outside of my world.

31:03.551 --> 31:06.918
You knew that I was into
Ty when you kissed me,

31:07.641 --> 31:11.118
but it doesn't matter because
I'm over him and I'm into you.

31:22.900 --> 31:25.221
Do you want to come with me
and help put this one up?

31:50.900 --> 31:54.115
I heard we're going up against
each other for point guard?

31:54.361 --> 31:56.743
- Yeah.
- How did that happen?

31:57.295 --> 31:59.586
What do you mean?
He changed his mind I guess.

31:59.869 --> 32:02.897
Wait, you knew you had trouble posting up

32:02.897 --> 32:05.503
so you convinced him to
let you go out for guard.

32:05.503 --> 32:08.972
- I would never do that.
- I have done everything for you

32:08.972 --> 32:10.396
and this is how you repay me?

32:10.870 --> 32:12.943
I'm sorry things turned out this way.

32:12.943 --> 32:13.912
What do you want me to do?

32:13.912 --> 32:15.937
Tell him you don't
want to go out for guard.

32:16.653 --> 32:18.352
I'm not doing that.

32:19.064 --> 32:22.268
Wow, I guess you're not
the friend that I thought you were.

32:22.268 --> 32:24.831
Let me ask you something...
where did coach Medlock

32:24.831 --> 32:27.895
get the idea that selling
the watch for the lesson was my plan?

32:27.895 --> 32:31.751
I never said that.
You probably misunderstood him.

32:31.751 --> 32:34.355
He doesn't move his lips
very much when he talks.

32:41.964 --> 32:44.182
That's quite a stare
you got going on there.

32:44.197 --> 32:46.675
- How's the book proposal coming?
- Fine.

32:47.696 --> 32:49.524
I wonder when my security clearance

32:49.524 --> 32:51.653
is going to be high enough
for me to read that.

32:51.929 --> 32:55.450
Really, who am I kidding?
Sarah Lazar is the real writer.

32:55.450 --> 32:57.913
- What?
- It's probably best

32:57.913 --> 33:01.677
if I just have this as my own private way

33:01.677 --> 33:03.905
of dealing with everything
that's happened.

33:05.608 --> 33:07.208
Like a journal.

33:07.360 --> 33:08.426
Sweetie, Sarah Lazar

33:08.426 --> 33:10.302
doesn't know this family
the way that you do.

33:10.302 --> 33:12.428
I think dropping it
would be a huge mistake.

33:12.428 --> 33:14.572
But you know what? I'm not gonna push you

33:14.572 --> 33:16.706
to do something you don't want to do.

33:17.222 --> 33:18.478
Thanks.

33:19.980 --> 33:22.014
Why do you think Toby quit baseball?

33:23.281 --> 33:24.595
Did I push him too hard?

33:25.315 --> 33:27.133
I don't think that's
why he stopped playing.

33:27.133 --> 33:29.199
I think he found other interests,

33:29.252 --> 33:30.562
like his music.

33:32.442 --> 33:33.538
His music?

33:33.538 --> 33:35.040
What's so wrong about that?

33:35.980 --> 33:38.214
Well, you know, best case he's a rock star

33:38.247 --> 33:40.180
wearing leather pants till he's 60.

33:40.214 --> 33:41.757
Worst case, he's playing on street corners

33:41.757 --> 33:43.842
collecting change in an empty guitar case.

33:43.842 --> 33:46.909
John, it's his dream.

33:49.238 --> 33:50.288
Yeah.

33:56.232 --> 33:58.978
Ah, the tyranny of the blank canvas.

33:58.978 --> 34:00.286
Oh, hey.

34:00.934 --> 34:03.951
- The catalog with the Jenny Holzer in it.
- Thanks.

34:04.571 --> 34:08.051
Uh, hey, I think I drove by your gallery.

34:08.051 --> 34:09.315
It's on 17th street, right?

34:09.315 --> 34:10.668
Yeah, 17th and Baltimore.

34:10.668 --> 34:11.764
There was this really cool

34:11.764 --> 34:14.042
piece of street art on a wall nearby.

34:14.042 --> 34:16.563
It was this girl...
I think she was holding a hammer.

34:16.563 --> 34:18.674
- Yeah, somebody put it up last night.
- Really?

34:18.674 --> 34:21.478
I was hoping to leave all
the banksy wannabes behind in New York,

34:21.478 --> 34:24.327
- but apparently they're everywhere.
- Banksy wannabes?

34:24.327 --> 34:25.833
No, it was cute.

34:25.833 --> 34:29.214
Huh. Well, I thought it was kind of cool.

34:31.246 --> 34:33.206
So I guess Kansas City artists

34:33.206 --> 34:35.518
weren't all that
you were hoping they'd be.

34:35.518 --> 34:37.420
I've actually been excited by a few.

34:38.551 --> 34:40.596
Patrick? What are you doing here?

34:40.596 --> 34:42.978
I was dropping off a catalog with Bay.

34:43.733 --> 34:46.330
- Can I talk to you for a sec?
- Sure.

34:46.330 --> 34:48.746
I became a curator
for this exact reason...

34:48.746 --> 34:51.146
to stumble upon a piece
that stays with you.

34:51.380 --> 34:54.080
This is my first show here,
I want to make a splash

34:54.114 --> 34:55.601
and I want your piece in my show.

34:55.601 --> 34:57.962
Look, I appreciate
your determination here.

34:57.962 --> 35:00.542
- Can I ask what the hesitation is?
- Bay.

35:00.542 --> 35:02.518
Well, it's not like
it's your piece versus hers.

35:02.518 --> 35:04.320
I'm responding to your painting.

35:04.320 --> 35:07.428
I know that. You're not a mother.

35:07.428 --> 35:10.205
I just don't see how neither
of you being in the show

35:10.205 --> 35:11.682
makes you a good mom.

35:22.354 --> 35:24.013
All right, thank you, ladies.

35:24.013 --> 35:27.314
Next Sinclair and Vasquez...
Sinclair takes the ball out first.

35:33.785 --> 35:36.042
You want me to tell you
when he blows the whistle?

35:36.537 --> 35:37.561
That's okay.

35:37.561 --> 35:39.577
He'll blow it again after I score on you.

35:51.422 --> 35:52.525
Ready to post up?

36:02.680 --> 36:05.146
Looks like those Lotte Macomb
lessons are really paying off, huh?

36:05.146 --> 36:06.976
Huh. Yes, they are.

36:29.196 --> 36:30.208
Damn it!

36:39.178 --> 36:41.503
Wait, he's putting something
of yours in his show?

36:41.503 --> 36:43.621
I'm not sure. I mean
I'm thinking about it.

36:43.621 --> 36:46.975
I wanted you to know, but I promise
you none of this was planned.

36:46.975 --> 36:49.391
He was at my place and
my mom showed it to him...

36:49.391 --> 36:51.880
There goes Adrianna again...
sticking her nose in everything.

36:51.880 --> 36:55.633
Hold on. I am sorry for
how all this happened,

36:55.633 --> 36:58.204
but I really did want
to show him your work.

36:58.204 --> 37:00.591
- Whatever, Regina.
- Everything I said to him

37:00.591 --> 37:02.658
about your stuff is true. Honey...

37:02.691 --> 37:06.439
You know what I don't get?
Angelo just left.

37:06.729 --> 37:07.326
What?

37:07.326 --> 37:09.842
Am I the only one
who cares that he's gone?

37:09.843 --> 37:12.552
I thought you were in love with
him or was that an act too?

37:12.552 --> 37:14.204
Hey, watch your tone with me.

37:14.204 --> 37:15.572
You went on a date with this guy?

37:15.572 --> 37:17.038
What happens when Angelo comes back?

37:17.038 --> 37:19.602
That man walked out on us... again.

37:20.071 --> 37:22.370
He could've stayed and fought,
but he didn't.

37:22.370 --> 37:23.667
He just took off.

37:25.266 --> 37:27.485
So what are you saying?
He's never coming back?

37:28.634 --> 37:31.663
Hey, guys, Emmett's here.
It's family photo time.

37:31.924 --> 37:32.966
Come on.

38:55.652 --> 38:58.476
So I got the spot. I'm gonna be starting.

38:58.476 --> 39:00.235
Well, that's great! That's fantastic.

39:00.235 --> 39:02.200
That's fan-tastic.

39:02.475 --> 39:04.488
I guess so. I mean yes, it is.

39:04.488 --> 39:06.170
Yeah, good for you.

39:08.515 --> 39:09.761
Hey hey, Toby.

39:10.718 --> 39:14.351
So your mom got tickets for
the Treads & Threads thing.

39:14.385 --> 39:17.218
And I was hoping maybe
you could score us some,

39:17.251 --> 39:19.551
you know, floor passes for the show?

39:20.102 --> 39:22.475
There aren't any floor passes.

39:23.044 --> 39:25.247
Oh, I didn't know.

39:26.870 --> 39:28.349
Look, I'm... I'm try... I'm trying.

39:28.349 --> 39:31.291
Dad, you let me convert part of
the garage into a music studio,

39:31.291 --> 39:33.773
I play every day. I just don't get

39:33.773 --> 39:35.888
why you don't see how
serious I am about this.

39:35.888 --> 39:37.755
I don't know anything about music.

39:38.345 --> 39:41.370
I don't know anybody.
I don't have any connections.

39:41.370 --> 39:43.989
- I can't help you.
- Dad, I don't need you to help me.

39:45.421 --> 39:46.762
I just need you to get it.

39:59.927 --> 40:02.606
Thank you, Emmett.
I'm so excited to see them.

40:14.132 --> 40:15.189
Hey.

40:16.150 --> 40:18.855
What's wrong? Is this still about Ty?

40:27.881 --> 40:30.394
I'm sorry that everyone was so annoying.

40:36.374 --> 40:37.177
Sure.

40:42.464 --> 40:45.992
Have things really been
that bad with your parents?

41:12.794 --> 41:14.183
Did you just say...

41:15.096 --> 41:17.487
I'm sorry. This is about
you and your family.

41:17.487 --> 41:18.972
What... just, um... keep going.

41:23.049 --> 41:24.221
Did you just say

41:24.221 --> 41:28.570
"Are we going to fall out of love?"

41:30.098 --> 41:33.454
meaning we are currently...

41:41.832 --> 41:43.176
Me too.
