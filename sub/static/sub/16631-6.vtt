WEBVTT

00:06.000 --> 00:07.786
- You're never gonna
get away with this.

00:07.830 --> 00:08.956
- I already have.

00:09.000 --> 00:10.604
- My daughter's
lending her efforts

00:10.660 --> 00:11.911
to a munitions factory.

00:11.960 --> 00:14.042
- Yes, up there
with the secretaries.

00:14.100 --> 00:17.524
- You're giving my kids
a real gift with those letters.

00:17.580 --> 00:20.617
- It seems cruel to keep
pretending their father's alive.

00:20.670 --> 00:23.446
- What happened the other night
was a mistake. I'm married.

00:23.500 --> 00:25.661
- There isn't gonna be
a safe place for us?

00:25.720 --> 00:27.324
- I wish there were.

00:27.370 --> 00:29.543
- [Vera]:
I won't live like this.

00:29.590 --> 00:32.104
Why let them see I was nothing
but a pretty face?

00:32.160 --> 00:33.286
Now, I'm nothing.

00:33.330 --> 00:35.059
- Run, Marion! Run!

00:35.120 --> 00:36.769
- [Betty]:
You're safe here now.

00:36.810 --> 00:38.596
- [Kate]:
I barely recognize myself.

00:38.640 --> 00:39.948
- This is the new you.

00:39.990 --> 00:42.595
- I am so lucky I met you.

00:42.650 --> 00:44.595
- [Gladys]:
It's all I've ever wanted.

00:44.650 --> 00:45.639
- You sure?

00:49.350 --> 00:52.251
- [Man on radio]: Rear Admiral
Toshiro Matsunaga...

00:52.310 --> 00:55.302
- We can't seat the Rileys
and the Millers at Table 17.

00:55.350 --> 00:58.046
They're both anti-conscription.
- Split them up.

00:58.100 --> 01:00.660
- Better to set up a few
smaller tables at the wedding,

01:00.710 --> 01:02.052
like the Balkan States.

01:02.100 --> 01:04.568
- You should have chaired
the Treaty of Versailles.

01:04.620 --> 01:07.145
- Gangway! Toast and tea,
toast and tea!

01:07.190 --> 01:08.623
- Well!

01:08.670 --> 01:11.104
- Oh! These early-morning
shifts are the worst.

01:11.150 --> 01:12.845
- It's exhausting, Gladys,

01:12.890 --> 01:15.063
you racing about
like a panicked gazelle.

01:15.110 --> 01:17.192
- Well, the war waits
for no one, Mother.

01:17.250 --> 01:20.026
- You can't type memos all
day on a piece of toast.

01:20.080 --> 01:22.116
- Father, I'll miss
my streetcar!

01:22.160 --> 01:23.377
Bye.

01:23.430 --> 01:25.591
- Your chariot awaits.
- James!

01:25.650 --> 01:28.118
I'm late and a drive
would set everything right.

01:28.170 --> 01:31.162
- I just came to drop off
the revised defence contracts.

01:31.220 --> 01:33.347
I will drive
my fiance to work.

01:33.390 --> 01:36.518
- Peace has been negotiated.
See you tonight!

01:36.570 --> 01:38.219
Let's go!

01:38.270 --> 01:40.306
- I thought an office job
would temper her,

01:40.360 --> 01:42.521
but it seems _to have had
the oppOSIte effect.

01:42.580 --> 01:44.650
- The_ more we rail
against her JOb,

01:44.710 --> 01:46.746
the more she clings to it.

01:46.800 --> 01:49.143
- I suppose we should
muster a show of support.

01:49.190 --> 01:51.101
- Perhaps we might
take a drive.

01:52.320 --> 01:53.844
[Chuckling]

01:53.890 --> 01:55.016
- Fire!

01:55.070 --> 01:56.799
Clear!

01:59.240 --> 02:02.243
- This is it.
Home away from home!

02:02.290 --> 02:04.076
[Chuckles]

02:04.120 --> 02:06.429
- All right.
I'll see you.

02:06.470 --> 02:08.199
- That's the
best you got?

02:08.250 --> 02:09.774
- Everybody's
watching. Come on.

02:09.820 --> 02:11.253
- [Soldier]: Excuse me.
- Yeah?

02:11.300 --> 02:13.552
- Miss, could you point
me to the head office?

02:13.610 --> 02:16.078
- Where you came from.
That's the Line 3 Building.

02:16.130 --> 02:18.348
- Oh! And me trying
to be a land scout...

02:18.390 --> 02:20.654
- They say a junior
officer with a map

02:20.700 --> 02:22.918
is the most dangerous
thing in the field.

02:22.960 --> 02:24.564
- I won't tell your CO.

02:24.620 --> 02:26.224
- Appreciate
it, miss. Thanks!

02:26.270 --> 02:29.182
- Oh, doesn't your
heart go out to them?

02:29.230 --> 02:31.926
Giving up everything
to fight for us.

02:35.150 --> 02:37.937
- Hold onto your
tonsils, princess.

02:37.980 --> 02:39.277
[Laughs]

02:39.330 --> 02:41.321
- Now everybody's watching.

02:41.370 --> 02:43.156
- So let 'em.

02:43.200 --> 02:44.508
- See you later.

02:48.990 --> 02:50.946
Hey, Betts, wait up!

02:58.090 --> 02:59.694
- Ugh! I'm still
a tea girl.

02:59.740 --> 03:01.560
- You're never gonna
marry an Italian

03:01.610 --> 03:03.601
if you can't learn
to drink espresso.

03:03.660 --> 03:05.651
Try it with sugar.

03:05.700 --> 03:08.521
- The only one getting
married is you, meatball.

03:08.570 --> 03:10.356
Who's your latest
mystery girl?

03:10.400 --> 03:12.311
She let you
take her out yet?

03:12.360 --> 03:14.055
- She's pretty
old fashioned.

03:14.100 --> 03:16.227
So you need help with
your stuff tomorrow?

03:16.280 --> 03:19.363
- Nope, packing light.
The hospital's kicking me out.

03:19.410 --> 03:22.322
I've got a one-way ticket
back to my folks.

03:22.370 --> 03:24.361
- Thought you
hated it there.

03:24.420 --> 03:26.581
- I've got a face only
a mother could love.

03:26.640 --> 03:28.892
- That isn't true.
Don't think like that.

03:28.940 --> 03:30.589
You're still beautiful.

03:30.640 --> 03:31.595
- Yeah, yeah.

03:31.640 --> 03:32.686
[Chuckling]

03:36.470 --> 03:38.199
- You're subbing
for Gladys?

03:38.260 --> 03:39.739
- She got dragged
into payroll.

03:39.780 --> 03:41.771
Would you believe
the girl hasn't cashed

03:41.830 --> 03:43.821
a single cheque
since day one?

03:43.870 --> 03:46.782
- I suppose it just
didn't cross her mind.

03:46.830 --> 03:48.343
- You all right, Lor?

03:48.400 --> 03:50.391
You look greener than
a grasshopper's tush.

03:50.440 --> 03:51.998
- It's just a
little indigestion.

03:53.270 --> 03:55.181
[Gagging]

03:56.230 --> 03:57.447
- Lorna?
- Lorna!

03:57.490 --> 03:58.616
Lorna, what's wrong?

03:58.670 --> 04:00.319
- I'll get her
a drink of water.

04:00.370 --> 04:03.624
- Had some bad milk
for breakfast. I'm fine.

04:03.670 --> 04:05.274
I'm fine.
Go back to work.

04:06.760 --> 04:08.284
- You and James...

04:09.550 --> 04:11.279
Oh! What was it like?

04:11.330 --> 04:13.594
- Certainly not the chore
Mother says it is.

04:13.640 --> 04:15.335
- Gladys, if
people even think

04:15.380 --> 04:18.201
you and James went
all the way before marriage...

04:18.250 --> 04:22.254
- You honestly think, when this
war is over, anyone will care?

04:23.520 --> 04:25.511
How am I going
to cash these paycheques

04:25.560 --> 04:26.640
without Father knowing?

04:26.700 --> 04:27.769
[Knocking]

04:27.830 --> 04:29.252
- Can we get some
tea in here?

04:29.310 --> 04:30.345
- Certainly, Mr. Akins.

04:30.400 --> 04:31.913
And I've asked
the canteen

04:31.960 --> 04:33.746
to bring up a
tray of biscuits.

04:33.790 --> 04:35.178
- Well, all right, then.

04:35.230 --> 04:38.051
Gladys, onto the floor,
lickety-split! Come on!

04:38.100 --> 04:39.055
[Clapping]

04:39.100 --> 04:40.749
- What's got
him brassed off?

04:40.800 --> 04:43.405
- Some esteemed colleague of
the owner is dropping in.

04:43.450 --> 04:45.270
Mr. Akins wants to put
on a good show.

04:45.320 --> 04:47.663
- Well, it'll take more
than tea and biscuits.

04:52.550 --> 04:55.542
- No, drink it slow or
it'll come back up.

04:55.590 --> 04:57.467
[Groans]

04:57.510 --> 04:58.943
You know,
you've lost weight.

04:58.990 --> 05:01.379
- I always do
at the beginning.

05:01.430 --> 05:02.943
- You aren't?

05:02.990 --> 05:04.332
- No, it's nothing.

05:04.390 --> 05:06.290
- Did Christmas
come early?

05:06.340 --> 05:08.956
- My monthlies have been
all over the map for years.

05:09.000 --> 05:10.217
I'm sure it's just--

05:10.260 --> 05:12.125
- You must have
some Inkling, Lorna.

05:12.180 --> 05:13.477
You have done
this 3 times.

05:13.530 --> 05:16.875
- I don't feel up to a 4th
time, thank you very much.

05:16.920 --> 05:18.968
I'm not a young woman.

05:19.010 --> 05:20.568
- You're not an
old one either.

05:20.620 --> 05:22.440
- Please don't say
anything to Bob.

05:22.490 --> 05:24.355
- No, not a
peep, promise.

05:24.410 --> 05:27.447
Gotta say though, married
this long and still romantic?

05:27.500 --> 05:29.365
Gives a girl hope.

05:29.410 --> 05:31.059
[Chuckling]

05:38.200 --> 05:40.589
- You guys hear Vera's getting
out of the hospital?

05:40.640 --> 05:41.800
- She coming
back to work?

05:41.860 --> 05:43.157
- She's going back home.

05:43.210 --> 05:45.986
- To her family?
She can't stand them.

05:46.040 --> 05:49.294
- Looking like her only option,
and not a pretty one.

05:50.610 --> 05:53.864
- I gotta knock
some sense into her.

06:00.570 --> 06:03.573
- Look at you
serving tea.

06:03.620 --> 06:06.396
- Mr. Witham!

06:06.450 --> 06:08.577
- Quite the
impressive enterprise.

06:08.620 --> 06:10.963
- Mr. Akins!_Your
guest's arrived.

06:12.190 --> 06:14.329
- Morning!
Rollie Witham.

06:14.370 --> 06:16.326
- Oh! Harold Akins.

06:16.370 --> 06:18.759
Sir, if I'd known it was
you who was visiting--

06:18.810 --> 06:22.371
- In business, as in war, one
wants the element of surprise.

06:22.420 --> 06:25.674
I thought the ladies might
appreciate a holiday raffle.

06:25.730 --> 06:28.028
- Oh, that's
very generous.

06:28.080 --> 06:32.198
Oh, I'll have Miss Demers
take it off our hands.

06:32.260 --> 06:33.682
Miss Demers?

06:40.350 --> 06:43.137
With the rationing, your gift
will make a great difference.

06:43.180 --> 06:44.397
- My wife's idea.

06:44.440 --> 06:46.135
She _elected to
stay In the car.

06:46.180 --> 06:47.875
Explosives make
her nervous.

06:47.920 --> 06:49.740
- Excuse me, excuse me...

06:49.800 --> 06:52.610
Excuse me, excuse me!
Excuse me!

06:52.670 --> 06:53.887
Sorry! Excuse me!

06:53.930 --> 06:55.010
- Carol?

06:55.060 --> 06:57.449
- Leave! Scram! Vamoose!
- What?

06:57.500 --> 06:59.752
- Your father, he's here.
- My father's what?

06:59.810 --> 07:02.324
- He's talking to Mr. Akins.
- What do you mean?

07:02.370 --> 07:05.328
- I thought I'd see
Gladys in the office here.

07:05.380 --> 07:06.415
Where's her desk?

07:06.460 --> 07:07.597
- Desk?

07:07.640 --> 07:10.245
- Well, surely she
doesn't work standing up.

07:10.290 --> 07:12.554
- She's on her feet
at her station.

07:20.300 --> 07:22.951
Mr. Witham, the floor
is strictly regulated!

07:23.000 --> 07:25.525
There's nails on
the soles of your shoes!

07:25.570 --> 07:27.049
One spark and--
- Let it blow!

07:28.270 --> 07:29.874
- [Man]:
Hey, buddy!

07:29.920 --> 07:31.353
- Can I help you, sir?

07:31.400 --> 07:33.220
- Daddy, I--

07:33.270 --> 07:35.409
-_ You be_st come
With me right now.

07:35.450 --> 07:37.759
- We'll deal with it.
- [Rollie]: I said now!

07:37.800 --> 07:39.620
- [Harold]:
Just give it a minute.

07:39.670 --> 07:42.138
- [Marco]:
Let me take care of this!

07:42.200 --> 07:43.804
You wanna get
rid of this guy?

07:43.850 --> 07:45.067
- I'm not going, Daddy.

07:45.110 --> 07:47.158
You're the one who
shouldn't be here.

07:47.200 --> 07:50.328
- [Man]: Who put that guy
on the floor?

07:50.380 --> 07:52.848
- You told us you
worked in an office.

07:52.900 --> 07:54.288
That was the deal.

07:54.340 --> 07:56.240
- The deal's changed.

07:56.300 --> 07:58.200
This is what
people need of me.

07:58.260 --> 08:00.478
- Girls, let's mind
your own affairs!

08:00.520 --> 08:03.216
- I came here to support you.
- And to drum up business.

08:03.260 --> 08:05.478
[Clinking, all gasp]

08:05.520 --> 08:08.307
- What has gotten into you?
- [Marco]: Sir, settle down!

08:08.350 --> 08:10.784
- You've lied to us,
played us for fools.

08:10.830 --> 08:12.092
- I should have told you.

08:12.140 --> 08:13.653
- Come on, it's time to go!

08:13.710 --> 08:15.098
- But you didn't tell us,

08:15.140 --> 08:16.926
because you knew
it was wrong.

08:16.970 --> 08:20.098
- I belong here. I earned the
right to stand with these women!

08:20.150 --> 08:21.879
- Listen--

08:23.190 --> 08:25.055
With respect, sir,

08:25.110 --> 08:27.146
you better leave this
factory right now...

08:27.200 --> 08:30.101
or I'm gonna knock
you down and drag you out.

08:32.290 --> 08:34.758
- Say your goodbyes, Gladdy.

08:34.810 --> 08:36.766
And take your time,

08:36.820 --> 08:38.594
'cause you're never
coming back here.

08:38.640 --> 08:40.642
- [Lorna]:
Back to work, girls.

08:40.690 --> 08:42.510
Back to work!

08:52.610 --> 08:54.168
[Clearing throat]

08:54.220 --> 08:56.302
- We've built everything
so carefully.

08:56.360 --> 08:57.611
and that stupid girl...

08:57.660 --> 08:59.969
James will pull out
of this wedding

09:00.010 --> 09:01.352
if we're not careful!

09:01.410 --> 09:03.059
- Cooler heads
Will prevail.

09:03.100 --> 09:05.568
Some explosives need to
be defused, not detonated.

09:05.630 --> 09:08.269
- She's all we
have left, Addie.

09:08.330 --> 09:11.629
If something happens
to her in there...

09:11.680 --> 09:14.808
- Let me handle
this, sweetheart.

09:14.850 --> 09:17.592
I may have a way
to bring her back.

09:22.080 --> 09:23.331
- Well done, Skip!

09:23.380 --> 09:25.598
It's the best
we've seen so far.

09:25.650 --> 09:27.550
- Daddy flies even higher.

09:27.610 --> 09:29.601
- Say, we better
pack it in, kid.

09:29.650 --> 09:31.163
Your Mom will be here soon.

09:31.220 --> 09:32.869
- Mommy cries at night.

09:32.920 --> 09:34.820
Is it 'cause he flew too high?

09:34.870 --> 09:37.430
- Oh! Your mom just...

09:37.480 --> 09:38.879
[Sighing]

09:38.920 --> 09:40.262
She just misses him.

09:40.310 --> 09:43.359
- He flew to heaven,
didn't he?

09:43.400 --> 09:45.448
- Skip, listen,

09:45.490 --> 09:49.108
there's some things little boys
just aren't ready to hear about.

09:49.150 --> 09:51.277
- Is it because I'm bad?

09:51.320 --> 09:54.756
- No. Your mom cries 'cause
your daddy can't come home.

09:54.810 --> 09:56.493
- Ever?

09:56.550 --> 09:57.972
- He's gotta stay up there,

09:58.030 --> 10:00.328
flying his Lancaster.

10:00.380 --> 10:02.723
Make sure you chart
the right course.

10:02.770 --> 10:04.943
- Why did God pick
my Daddy to die?

10:04.990 --> 10:06.594
[Sighing]

10:06.640 --> 10:09.200
- I think God sat
this one out, kid.

10:09.260 --> 10:11.387
Some men just
run out of luck.

10:13.960 --> 10:17.088
- Well, a nurse's aide sounds
like a great position.

10:17.130 --> 10:19.303
- Oh, it isn't all
that much really,

10:19.350 --> 10:21.784
mostly doling out pills
and scrubbing bedpans.

10:21.830 --> 10:24.139
They've got training
to become a real nurse.

10:24.180 --> 10:27.354
That's something I'd like.
They already know me in the lab.

10:27.400 --> 10:30.142
My mom had me sneak in
a pregnancy test for a girl.

10:30.190 --> 10:32.181
- Sheila!
- Oh, Mom! This is Marco.

10:32.240 --> 10:34.492
Do you know each
other from VicMu?

10:34.540 --> 10:38.271
We call him the Doughboy 'cause
of all the pastries he brings.

10:38.330 --> 10:40.059
- Mr. Moretti.

10:40.110 --> 10:41.839
- I was saying there's
a factory girl

10:41.900 --> 10:43.413
who might be
in the family way.

10:43.460 --> 10:45.633
- That's private!
- I didn't tell him who!

10:45.680 --> 10:47.636
How can I?
You never told me!

10:47.690 --> 10:50.591
- Your mother's right. A girl's
gotta protect her good name.

10:50.650 --> 10:52.777
- We're not supposed
to do anonymous tests.

10:52.820 --> 10:55.516
But I called in a few favours.
They like me here.

10:55.560 --> 10:57.289
- I can see why.
Vera says you give

10:57.350 --> 10:59.124
better care than most
of the doctors.

10:59.180 --> 11:02.263
- All those years looking after
my dad were good for something!

11:02.310 --> 11:03.789
I should get back to work.

11:03.830 --> 11:05.957
- See ya.

11:09.490 --> 11:11.708
- [Whispering]:
She's my daughter, Marco.

11:11.750 --> 11:13.229
My daughter!

11:13.280 --> 11:14.929
- What? We were just talking.

11:14.970 --> 11:18.360
- As if you ever
just talk to a girl.

11:20.500 --> 11:22.229
[Scoffing]

11:22.290 --> 11:24.190
- [Vera]: My time at
the factory is done!

11:24.240 --> 11:26.583
- Honestly, what did you
think you were gonna do?

11:26.640 --> 11:29.108
Just hop on a bus back
to the boondocks?

11:29.160 --> 11:31.151
- I'm not ready to face
the world again.

11:31.210 --> 11:32.984
- Vera, the doctors
did a fine job.

11:33.040 --> 11:34.428
- All thanks to you.

11:34.470 --> 11:36.256
I'll never forget
what you did for me.

11:36.300 --> 11:38.336
But it wasn't
enough. I'm sorry.

11:38.390 --> 11:40.779
- You have a job
here, a life.

11:40.830 --> 11:42.730
- I had a job.
Here in the hospital,

11:42.780 --> 11:45.123
I'm surrounded by
freaks and cripples everywhere.

11:45.180 --> 11:46.784
But outside...

11:46.830 --> 11:48.434
- We all have our scars.

11:48.490 --> 11:51.266
- Ladies, I'm going home.
End of story.

11:56.840 --> 11:59.365
- My husband came back
from the Great War,

11:59.410 --> 12:01.970
months in the
hospital, same as you,

12:02.020 --> 12:04.671
then home, where the
anlqlosis set in.

12:04.720 --> 12:08.804
He went in, Vera, and
he never came out again.

12:10.070 --> 12:13.892
- Well, I'm not
him, am I?

12:13.950 --> 12:15.986
- That's right.

12:16.030 --> 12:18.294
You're stronger.

12:18.340 --> 12:19.989
- She's right.

12:22.130 --> 12:23.734
- I just spoke
to your father.

12:23.780 --> 12:27.739
- I'm never going home. I'm done
with him trying to control me.

12:27.790 --> 12:30.475
- Where you gonna stay?
- Well here, of course!

12:30.530 --> 12:33.226
- Not before we're married.
How would that look?

12:33.270 --> 12:36.137
- Aren't you sick of it,
James, being proper?

12:36.190 --> 12:37.839
Isntlove
more important?

12:37.880 --> 12:40.440
People live together
now all the time.

12:40.490 --> 12:42.799
- Not our kind of people.
- Let's get married.

12:42.840 --> 12:44.796
- We are, next spring.

12:44.850 --> 12:47.102
- Why wait? You love me.
We wanna be together.

12:47.150 --> 12:50.062
Hell, we don't even know if the
free world will be standing

12:50.110 --> 12:51.452
when the tulips come!

12:51.500 --> 12:52.899
- Your parents will die.

12:52.940 --> 12:54.589
- You're not
marrying them!

12:54.640 --> 12:56.631
James, this is
our chance

12:56.680 --> 12:58.238
to carve out
the life we want.

12:58.290 --> 13:00.338
- Are you serious
about this?

13:00.380 --> 13:02.382
- What are we
waiting for?

13:02.430 --> 13:04.159
- After I get back
from Buffalo.

13:04.210 --> 13:05.518
Can you wait that long

13:05.560 --> 13:07.346
before you say "I do"?
- I can.

13:07.390 --> 13:10.473
- This is nuts.
You know that.

13:10.520 --> 13:13.171
- Well, you know how to
pick 'em, James Dunn.

13:13.220 --> 13:14.346
[Giggles]

13:14.400 --> 13:16.391
- Mmm! So
you're staying.

13:16.440 --> 13:17.964
- Uh-huh.

13:28.590 --> 13:31.104
[Door closing, footsteps]

13:34.770 --> 13:37.022
- Hello?

13:37.070 --> 13:38.765
[Door closing]

13:49.650 --> 13:51.902
- Some fine stitch-work there.

13:51.960 --> 13:54.258
- I need a lot
of practice.

13:54.310 --> 13:57.131
I helped Dr. Poitier with
this dreadful gash today.

13:57.180 --> 13:59.000
You should see his handwork.

13:59.050 --> 14:01.268
- You'll learn that if
you get into nursmg.

14:01.310 --> 14:03.835
- Marco thinks I should
be a nurse too.

14:03.880 --> 14:05.609
He saw me in action,

14:05.670 --> 14:07.615
said I had exceptional
bedside manner.

14:07.670 --> 14:10.753
- Sounds like our Florence
Nightingale's got a crush.

14:15.330 --> 14:17.059
- He's the "dishiest"!

14:17.110 --> 14:19.544
I swear _the nurses
kept Vera in for so long

14:19.590 --> 14:20.898
just so he'd
keep visiting.

14:20.940 --> 14:23.158
- You forget that man.
He's nothing but trouble.

14:23.210 --> 14:24.598
- Speaking of trouble,

14:24.640 --> 14:27.165
I have results for
that pregnancy test.

14:30.600 --> 14:32.989
See, the lab injected
a frog with a serum

14:33.040 --> 14:35.645
made from the patient's
urine you brought me.

14:35.700 --> 14:37.565
The frog spawned.

14:37.610 --> 14:40.602
I hope your girl is
happy with the news.

14:40.660 --> 14:41.911
- Her life's over.

14:41.960 --> 14:43.302
- Don't say that.

14:43.360 --> 14:44.691
[Knocking]

14:44.750 --> 14:46.399
- [Bob]:
I got it!

14:46.450 --> 14:48.008
- Take this as a lesson.

14:48.060 --> 14:51.484
There are certain mistakes
we can't ever fix.

14:51.540 --> 14:54.577
- Of course, come on in.
Right this way.

14:54.630 --> 14:57.622
We've got a
visitor here, Lorna.

14:57.670 --> 15:00.150
- I hope this isn't a bad time.
- Mrs. Witham.

15:07.730 --> 15:09.766
[Creaking]

15:20.570 --> 15:22.344
- Betty?

15:25.010 --> 15:26.910
Moira?

15:28.400 --> 15:30.356
Delores?

15:32.490 --> 15:36.312
Don't be silly.
They're at the movies.

15:44.030 --> 15:45.930
- Marion.

15:45.980 --> 15:47.288
[Gasps]

15:47.330 --> 15:49.059
- Father?

15:49.120 --> 15:51.020
- You've strayed off

15:51.080 --> 15:53.150
the straight and narrow,
daughter of mine.

15:55.820 --> 15:56.980
Marion?

15:57.040 --> 15:58.257
[Breathing
unevenly]

15:58.300 --> 15:59.335
Marion!

15:59.390 --> 16:00.994
- No! Leave me be, Father!

16:01.040 --> 16:03.213
- Listen to me! I looked
long and hard for you.

16:03.260 --> 16:04.431
I never gave up.

16:04.480 --> 16:06.209
- I'll jump
out my window!

16:06.260 --> 16:07.784
- It's your mother.

16:07.830 --> 16:10.264
You know how her lungs
have never been strong.

16:10.310 --> 16:12.961
We've prayed, put every
penny into her care.

16:13.010 --> 16:14.784
It's not enough.

16:14.840 --> 16:17.092
- I'll send her some money.
I can do that.

16:17.150 --> 16:19.311
But I have a life here now,
my own life.

16:19.360 --> 16:20.918
- Tell me then...

16:20.980 --> 16:24.495
You tell me what kind
of a life is that, huh?

16:25.810 --> 16:27.710
I tracked down
the studio,

16:27.760 --> 16:30.672
and I paid the man who took
those photos for your address.

16:30.720 --> 16:32.631
- It was only so
I could stay here.

16:32.680 --> 16:34.466
- Evil ends require
evil means.

16:34.510 --> 16:36.558
Tell me you are proud
of that filth!

16:36.600 --> 16:38.204
[Footsteps approaching]

16:38.250 --> 16:40.389
- Excuse me, we got
a problem here?

16:41.600 --> 16:42.817
- It's my father.

16:42.870 --> 16:44.383
He was just leaving.

16:44.430 --> 16:45.647
- Your father?

16:45.700 --> 16:47.691
- It's a pleasure.

16:47.740 --> 16:49.958
- Not for me, Mister.

16:50.000 --> 16:52.878
- Help us,
Marion, please.

16:52.920 --> 16:54.137
Come back.

16:54.180 --> 16:56.648
- The girls will be back
from the pictures soon.

16:57.660 --> 16:59.571
- I'll leave you, Marion,

16:59.620 --> 17:02.919
and I beg you'll
remember your mother.

17:02.970 --> 17:06.622
God's eyes, not mine,
are always on you.

17:21.340 --> 17:23.558
- So it was "Marion."

17:25.430 --> 17:27.250
- Yeah.

17:27.300 --> 17:29.291
That's who
I used to be.

17:40.450 --> 17:43.317
- A fine girl reflects
well on her family.

17:43.360 --> 17:44.964
- We're very
proud of her.

17:45.020 --> 17:47.147
- And doing excellent
work at the hospital.

17:47.190 --> 17:48.498
- How do you know that?

17:48.540 --> 17:51.589
- One picks things up
here and there.

17:53.070 --> 17:55.322
- What can I do
for you, Mrs. Witham?

17:55.370 --> 17:58.806
- I want you to fire
my daughter.

18:00.380 --> 18:02.336
- No.

18:02.380 --> 18:04.553
I am merely shift matron.

18:04.600 --> 18:06.465
- You understand
it's not a vocation

18:06.520 --> 18:08.590
for a someone of
Gladys's background.

18:08.650 --> 18:11.118
- No shame fighting
for our country.

18:11.170 --> 18:13.479
- We both want better
lives for our girls.

18:13.520 --> 18:15.738
That's why I'm happy
to return the favour

18:15.790 --> 18:17.121
as Sheila's
benefactress.

18:17.180 --> 18:19.785
- My husband and
I are certainly capable

18:19.830 --> 18:22.298
of managing nursing
school, thank you.

18:22.360 --> 18:24.521
- That's the problem
with you people.

18:24.580 --> 18:25.877
You think too small.

18:25.930 --> 18:28.000
If your daughter's
drawn to medicine,

18:28.060 --> 18:30.699
why be a nurse when
you can be a physician?

18:33.240 --> 18:36.676
You get Gladys fired
from your factory,

18:36.720 --> 18:40.281
I promise, we'll all
be very happy.

18:45.290 --> 18:47.633
Good night,
Mrs. Corbett.

18:56.650 --> 18:57.958
- [Man on radio]:
In Tokyo,

Tomokazu Hori,

the Cabinet
Information Board...

...announced yesterday that

19:04.180 --> 19:06.432

would continue...

19:06.490 --> 19:08.048
- You heartless bastard!

19:08.100 --> 19:10.318
Thanks to you, Skip told
his little sister

19:10.360 --> 19:12.009
that daddy's never
coming home!

19:14.240 --> 19:16.185
- That doesn't
give you the right

19:16.240 --> 19:18.140
to destroy my
children's lives!

19:18.200 --> 19:20.191
- Your kids are
gonna be fine.

19:20.240 --> 19:23.107
You're the one who can't
live with the truth.

19:23.160 --> 19:25.890
Your husband is dead and
he's never coming back.

19:25.940 --> 19:27.896
- You think that
I don't know that?

Good God! Your legs aren't
the only thing crippled.

19:32.300 --> 19:34.074
[Door slams]

called my parents.

You're now officially
a bad influence.

19:40.170 --> 19:43.048
They barely let me out
of house this morning.

19:43.090 --> 19:44.569
- I'm so sorry...

even think I should be

19:46.920 --> 19:48.171
your maid of honour.

19:48.230 --> 19:50.039
- Well, you're
off the hook.

19:50.100 --> 19:52.136
James and I
are g0ing to elope.

19:52.190 --> 19:53.441
- Why?

19:53.490 --> 19:54.969
- Because we
love each other.

19:55.010 --> 19:57.274
I thought you'd be
happy for me.

19:57.320 --> 19:59.538

- VicMu's greatest sprinter.

20:09.770 --> 20:11.283
- I'll see you
later, I think.

20:11.340 --> 20:14.468
- Oh, Carol, it means
they like you!

20:14.510 --> 20:17.729
- Looks like somebody
didn't go home last night.

20:17.780 --> 20:19.384
- Guess who's
got news?

20:20.650 --> 20:21.605
Oh!

20:21.650 --> 20:23.299
- What is it?

20:23.350 --> 20:25.864
- [Man]: Hey, hey, whoa!
Stop her from going in.

20:25.920 --> 20:27.308
- [Woman]:
Oh my goodness!

20:27.350 --> 20:28.658
- Vera?

20:32.440 --> 20:34.579
- She came back.

20:36.530 --> 20:39.886
- Morning, girls!
Dying for a gasper.

20:43.540 --> 20:46.759
Mmm! Tried to quit while
I was in the hospital,

20:46.810 --> 20:48.755
but what else is
there to do?

20:48.810 --> 20:50.766
- It's great to see
you back, Vera.

20:50.810 --> 20:52.766
- You remember Gladys?

20:52.810 --> 20:55.506
- Yeah, you liked
my hair once.

20:55.550 --> 20:59.031
- Ladies, those casings
won't stuff themselves!

21:01.560 --> 21:03.380
Well, Miss Burr,

21:03.430 --> 21:07.161
the barrette, make sure
that stays in your locker.

21:07.220 --> 21:09.643
- Boy, you haven't changed.

21:09.700 --> 21:13.136
- Neither have you,
Miss Burr. Neither have you.

21:13.180 --> 21:15.262
[Chuckling]

21:26.980 --> 21:29.232
- Lorna! Hey, wait.

21:29.280 --> 21:30.235
- Let go of me!

21:30.280 --> 21:31.497
- Well, then stop.

21:31.550 --> 21:33.029
About last night,
what you said.

21:33.070 --> 21:35.061
You really think I'd
lay a hand on Sheila?

21:35.110 --> 21:36.281
- You were shameless.

21:36.330 --> 21:37.592
- She's a girl
with a crush.

21:37.640 --> 21:40.279
- She's my daughter and
I'm trying to protect her.

21:40.340 --> 21:43.161
-_ You're so convinced this
Will all blow up in your face.

21:43.210 --> 21:44.598
- We can't do
this, Marco.

21:44.650 --> 21:46.208
This whole thing is madness.

21:46.260 --> 21:48.125
So please, just walk away.

21:53.830 --> 21:55.866
- Fine.

22:04.620 --> 22:07.180
- You ready for a bomb?

22:07.230 --> 22:11.143
Day after tomorrow,
I'll be Mrs. James Dunn.

22:11.190 --> 22:12.794
- Married tomorrow?

22:12.850 --> 22:13.930
- What? Really?

22:13.980 --> 22:15.629
- Well, after
my father's outburst,

22:15.680 --> 22:17.978
we decided it was time
to make a new home.

22:18.030 --> 22:21.329
- That's a steep price to pay
to walk away from your family.

22:21.380 --> 22:22.938
- They want to be
in my life,

22:22.990 --> 22:24.890
they'll have to do
it on my terms.

22:24.950 --> 22:26.167
- Oh!

22:26.210 --> 22:28.678
Vera, can I
get a sub in?

22:30.000 --> 22:31.388
- Yeah, of course.

22:31.430 --> 22:33.125
That's my job.

22:33.170 --> 22:36.515
- Mrs. Corbett! I'm sorry
for the late notice,

22:36.570 --> 22:38.697
but I need the day
after tomorrow off.

22:38.740 --> 22:42.176
- We're all on extra shifts to
make quota over the holidays.

22:42.230 --> 22:44.391
- I'll put in the time.
It's for a good reason.

22:44.450 --> 22:45.781
I'm getting married!

22:45.840 --> 22:48.001
- I assume it's
to the young man

22:48.060 --> 22:50.756
who leaves you breathless
and tardy at the factory gates.

22:50.800 --> 22:52.495
- Well, we're in love!

22:52.540 --> 22:55.532
- Yeah, you're too young
to know your own heart.

22:55.590 --> 22:58.491
When you get married, you have
to put your family first.

22:58.550 --> 23:00.541
From what I saw_of
your father's Vi5it,

23:00.590 --> 23:02.842
it didn't seem like
you're ready to do that.

23:02.900 --> 23:05.289
- James is nothing
like my father.

23:05.340 --> 23:06.284
- Not yet.

23:06.340 --> 23:07.375
The man who proposes,

23:07.420 --> 23:08.762
he's not the man you marry.

23:08.820 --> 23:09.809
They change.

23:09.860 --> 23:11.384
- Back to the
grind, Vera?

23:11.430 --> 23:13.079
- Just like riding
a bicycle.

23:15.480 --> 23:17.698
- I don't need
your permi55ion.

23:17.740 --> 23:20.379
- If you think marriage
will make you free,

23:20.440 --> 23:22.431
it won't solve
your problems.

23:22.480 --> 23:24.300
Trust me.

23:24.350 --> 23:27.649
- Mrs. Corbett, I'm sorry
if you hate your life.

23:27.710 --> 23:31.225
Do you ever think that
maybe I have a better one?

23:33.580 --> 23:36.401
- Take the day, Gladys.
Make it special.

Ow!

24:06.000 --> 24:07.308
- [Man]:
Is she OK?

24:07.350 --> 24:08.339
- It's OK.

24:09.620 --> 24:11.133
- What happened here?

24:11.180 --> 24:13.000
- I'm sorry, Mrs. Corbett.
I'm so sorry.

24:13.060 --> 24:14.664
- They had her on
the stencil line.

24:14.710 --> 24:17.964
- Who brought
Vera on this line?

24:18.020 --> 24:20.443
- I did.

24:20.500 --> 24:22.536
I thought it was OK.

24:28.420 --> 24:29.808
- Are you hurt?

24:29.850 --> 24:31.806
- It's just bruised.

24:31.860 --> 24:33.816
- I'll get you some ice.

24:33.860 --> 24:36.909
- [Lorna]: It's OK, ladies.
Go back to your stations.

24:36.950 --> 24:38.645
- I'm OK.
Nothing happened.

24:38.690 --> 24:41.648
_- When I saw those
prOJectiles swmging at you,

24:41.690 --> 24:43.248
my heart stopped.

24:43.300 --> 24:46.303
- You sure about this?

24:46.350 --> 24:49.433
I just figured,
a girl like her would--

24:49.480 --> 24:51.266
- Would be smarter?

24:51.310 --> 24:53.778
It's not just working girls
who lose their heads.

24:53.840 --> 24:56.923
- Yeah, well, the father's
getting his wish,

24:56.970 --> 25:00.531
but I can't imagine this
is how he wanted it.

25:00.580 --> 25:03.231
- You can see why she's so eager
to get herself married.

25:03.280 --> 25:05.316
- You never were a big fan.

25:05.370 --> 25:07.361
- Gladys was a good worker.

25:07.410 --> 25:09.753
- Except now,
she's a bad girl.

25:14.070 --> 25:15.549
- Fired?

25:15.600 --> 25:17.852
You can't do
that without cause.

25:17.900 --> 25:20.039
- Trust me, Miss Witham,
I have plenty.

25:20.080 --> 25:22.423
- Because I got
Vera to sub in?

25:22.470 --> 25:25.940
- We'll forward your last pay
to the address on file.

25:26.000 --> 25:28.560
- It's not because I'm
getting married tomorrow.

25:28.610 --> 25:30.953
Plenty of married
women work here.

25:31.000 --> 25:33.139
- Not once they're
in a family way.

25:33.180 --> 25:34.875
- My name on a--

25:34.920 --> 25:36.649
- A positive test.

25:36.700 --> 25:38.304
And no woman
carrying a child

25:38.360 --> 25:39.964
is working
on the floor.

25:40.010 --> 25:41.614
- My father is
sabotaging me.

25:41.670 --> 25:44.571
- Looks to me you
betrayed yourself.

25:52.720 --> 25:55.188
- Thought I saw you
duck in here.

25:55.240 --> 25:58.368
- What do I have to do
for 5 minutes alone?

26:02.160 --> 26:04.720
- We still gotta
work together, Lorna.

26:04.780 --> 26:07.078
Let's not make
this uncomfortable.

26:07.130 --> 26:11.908
Whatever happened
between us, I respect you.

26:11.960 --> 26:15.179
You're a good person.
You are, Lorna.

26:15.220 --> 26:17.825

I'm not!

26:23.140 --> 26:25.131
All the awful things!

26:27.540 --> 26:29.883
I deserve this...

26:29.930 --> 26:32.273
I thought it was
finally my turn.

anywhere.

and the baby, both of you.

by you, Lorna, I swear.

the father, Marco.

27:11.360 --> 27:12.918
[Sighing]

27:17.940 --> 27:20.670
- But if it's not your test,
then where did it come from?

27:20.720 --> 27:22.506
- I don't know!
Somebody made it up.

27:22.550 --> 27:24.802
- Hospital letterhead?
Looks real enough to me.

27:24.860 --> 27:26.669
- I'm telling you,
someone forged it!

27:26.730 --> 27:28.539
How am I gonna explain
this to James?

27:28.600 --> 27:31.205
- You'll get tested and
you'll prove it to him.

27:31.250 --> 27:33.514
- By then, the damage
will already be done.

27:33.560 --> 27:34.777
I'll be a fallen woman.

27:34.820 --> 27:36.606
- It's gotta be
somebody else's test.

27:36.650 --> 27:39.562
- They didn't erase a name
off the document.

27:39.610 --> 27:40.690

27:40.740 --> 27:42.822
if you have enough
influence and money.

27:42.870 --> 27:45.691
- You honestly think your
father would rather hurt you

than see you happy?

31:46.200 --> 31:48.543
That is a
nasty lump there.

31:48.600 --> 31:49.635
Does it hurt?

31:49.690 --> 31:51.988
- Nah, feels good.

31:53.820 --> 31:57.733
- You know, I used to sing
to feel something.

31:57.780 --> 32:00.294
Now it's more like
I feel something and I sing.

32:12.580 --> 32:14.969
- I really
like you, Kate.

32:15.020 --> 32:17.272
- I like you too, Betty.

32:21.200 --> 32:22.406
What are you doing?

32:22.460 --> 32:23.882
- Well, you said you--

32:23.940 --> 32:26.283
- What do you
think I am?

32:26.330 --> 32:28.025
- Nothing!
I'm--I'm sorry.

32:28.070 --> 32:29.458
It's--it's stupid, I--

32:29.510 --> 32:31.375
Look, I--I just--
I thought--

32:31.420 --> 32:32.637
- That's disgusting!

32:32.680 --> 32:34.466
And if you
can't see that,

32:34.510 --> 32:35.943
then you're
disgusting too!

32:45.480 --> 32:48.085
- [Man on radio]: the American
president's statement

32:48.140 --> 32:50.301
was just read to reporters
by Stephen Early,

32:50.350 --> 32:52.090
the president's secretary.

32:52.140 --> 32:55.439
A Japanese attack on Pearl
Harbour naturally means war.

32:55.490 --> 32:56.969
Such an attack demands--

32:57.010 --> 32:58.272
- Turn that back on.

32:58.320 --> 33:00.925
- You're that_
desperate to Win?

33:00.970 --> 33:03.882
- I'm not a man who likes
to be kept in the dark.

33:03.930 --> 33:07.320
- I always knew you
were ruthless, Daddy,

33:07.370 --> 33:09.065
but destroy
my reputation?

33:09.110 --> 33:10.634
Why?

33:10.680 --> 33:13.194
- It's time you took
responsibility for your actions.

33:13.250 --> 33:16.765
- I'm happy to do so When it's
something I've actually done!

33:16.820 --> 33:18.549
- Risking your life
at the factory--

33:18.600 --> 33:20.204
- Is something
I did, yes,

33:20.250 --> 33:22.593
but I did not
get pregnant!

33:22.650 --> 33:24.902
- Pregnant?
- I'm not!

33:24.950 --> 33:26.474
So why tell
my boss that I am?

33:26.520 --> 33:28.249
- Gladdy...

33:28.310 --> 33:31.347
How could you think I'd
say something like that

33:31.400 --> 33:32.731
about my
little girl?

33:32.790 --> 33:34.178
- I don't know
anymore, Daddy.

33:34.220 --> 33:36.302
We haven't exactly
been on the same side.

33:36.360 --> 33:39.830
- Finally gracing us
With your presence?

33:39.880 --> 33:42.747
You'ye missed
qUIte a lot.

33:42.800 --> 33:44.836
- So have we.

33:44.890 --> 33:47.973
- There's a young soldier
to see you in the library.

33:48.020 --> 33:48.975
- Soldier?

33:49.020 --> 33:50.544
- Don't keep
him waiting.

33:55.900 --> 33:59.245
Now, What in God's
name's happened?

34:00.510 --> 34:03.035
- Lewis?

34:04.910 --> 34:06.639
James?

34:06.690 --> 34:09.955
- Lieutenant James Dunn,
reporting for duty.

34:14.400 --> 34:16.652
I was in Buffalo when
they hit Pearl Harbour,

34:16.700 --> 34:19.305
and all I could think was
now it's our fight too.

34:19.360 --> 34:20.964
- So you let them recruit you?

34:21.010 --> 34:23.092
- You've always wanted
me in this war.

34:23.140 --> 34:25.005
That was before
I knew What war was!

34:25.060 --> 34:27.881
You said it yourself, you can
do more on the home front.

34:27.930 --> 34:29.443
We're all fighting hard.

34:29.500 --> 34:30.751
- But we're not winning!

34:30.800 --> 34:31.846
They wanna come at us,

34:31.890 --> 34:33.369
I'm coming right back at them.

34:33.410 --> 34:35.492
_- I'm not
looking for a hero.

34:35.550 --> 34:37.324
- When this war is over,

34:37.370 --> 34:40.419
could you love me ifI was
the one man that never fought?

34:40.460 --> 34:42.769
- It wasn't supposed
to be like this.

34:42.810 --> 34:45.244
- So we work with
What we've got.

34:45.300 --> 34:46.779
We go to City Hall
first thing.

34:46.820 --> 34:49.129
I've already booked us
a sleeper car to New York.

34:49.170 --> 34:51.991
I'll set you up there. I'll be
back by the spring, Gladys.

34:52.040 --> 34:53.826
We can start our lives.

34:56.260 --> 34:58.216
I thought this is
What you wanted.

34:58.270 --> 34:59.430
[Telephone ringing]

34:59.480 --> 35:01.129
- James, something happened

35:01.180 --> 35:03.785
and I'm sc--
I'm scared to tell you.

35:03.840 --> 35:06.445
- Well, we promised
ourselves no more secrets.

35:06.490 --> 35:08.879
- There's a rumour
that I'm pregnant.

35:08.930 --> 35:10.750
It's not true.

35:10.800 --> 35:12.882
But that doesn't matter.
Word's getting out.

35:12.930 --> 35:16.229
- Well, it's a good thing I'm
taking you away from all this.

35:17.980 --> 35:19.197
- Wildfire is spreading.

35:19.240 --> 35:20.548
- But we have a plan.

35:20.590 --> 35:22.501
- With James off
to war now...

35:22.550 --> 35:26.020
- No one will blink an eye
if we move up the wedding.

35:26.080 --> 35:28.378
- That's What we
were just thinking.

35:28.430 --> 35:30.466
- Call your
parents, James.

35:30.510 --> 35:34.332
- The club will make room.
We'll trim the guest list.

35:34.390 --> 35:36.119
Austerity in
times of trouble...

35:38.040 --> 35:39.860
- Damn Japs!

35:39.920 --> 35:43.560
Just watch, our quotas
Will go through the roof now!

35:43.610 --> 35:46.522
- Got you working
late, I see.

35:47.970 --> 35:49.835
- Miss Burr!

35:51.620 --> 35:54.794
- Had a little trouble
on the floor yesterday.

35:54.840 --> 35:58.059
- Yeah, yeah,
I heard all about it.

35:58.110 --> 36:01.102
- I have my high-school
diploma, took a typing class.

36:01.150 --> 36:04.153
I thought maybe you might have
some work for me in the office.

36:04.200 --> 36:07.158
- Clerical work requires, uh...

36:08.420 --> 36:10.763
Sometimes there's visitors.

36:10.820 --> 36:13.687
There's a social aspect
to the job and...

36:13.730 --> 36:16.119
- My Wig covers
my scar, sir.

36:16.170 --> 36:17.944
Mostly.

36:18.000 --> 36:19.809
- Safety is
a big issue.

36:19.870 --> 36:23.306
Someone like you is,
um, a reminder.

36:23.350 --> 36:26.217
- Yeah, of how things
don't always turn out

36:26.270 --> 36:28.079
the way you want.

36:28.140 --> 36:31.917
- I'm sure Lorna can find you a
suitable position on the floor.

36:31.970 --> 36:33.835
- She can't do
much, Mr. Akins.

36:33.880 --> 36:35.666
That's, uh...

36:36.930 --> 36:38.625
Why I'm asking you.

36:38.670 --> 36:40.319
- Um...

36:40.370 --> 36:43.589
- They say all cats
look grey in the dark.

36:43.630 --> 36:46.281
- I don't know
What you're--

36:46.330 --> 36:49.197
- What do you
think, Mr. Akins?

36:49.250 --> 36:50.763
Do all cats look grey?

36:59.780 --> 37:02.681
- [Man on radio]:
The Prime Minister has emerged

37:02.740 --> 37:04.469
from a 3-hour cabinet meeting

37:04.520 --> 37:07.250
to announce a swift and
deCIswe declaration

37:07.310 --> 37:08.789
of war on Japan,

37:08.830 --> 37:10.604
With orders given
to the armed forces

37:10.660 --> 37:12.821
to engage the enemy,
Wherever found.

37:12.880 --> 37:16.043
While the original act of
declaring war on Germany

37:16.100 --> 37:17.658
means that no parliamentary...

37:17.710 --> 37:18.961
- [Bob]:
Where you off to?

37:19.010 --> 37:20.830
- The hospital for
an admissions lecture

37:20.890 --> 37:22.187
from the nursing college.

37:22.240 --> 37:24.538
- It's still on?

37:24.590 --> 37:26.535
- They'll need nurses
more than ever now.

37:26.590 --> 37:27.887
It's just girls.
Promise.

37:27.940 --> 37:29.100
- Don't be too late.

37:30.500 --> 37:33.583
Ask the College about the
medical program as well.

37:33.640 --> 37:35.198
- Medical program?

37:35.250 --> 37:37.150
- My goodness! Could I?

37:37.210 --> 37:39.428
- Anything's
possible, Sheila.

37:39.470 --> 37:41.552
We just have to be
smart about it.

37:41.600 --> 37:43.204
[Chuckles]

37:48.520 --> 37:50.602
- She'll never
forget this day.

37:50.650 --> 37:52.174
- No one will.

37:52.220 --> 37:54.302
-Ah...

37:54.350 --> 37:58.093
It'll bring the Americans in.
Could end the war sooner.

37:58.140 --> 38:01.610
- Yeah, the neutral
become allied.

38:01.670 --> 38:05.049
- You just wait.
It's all gonna be fine.

38:07.110 --> 38:10.409
- I need more than
words tonight, Bob.

38:10.460 --> 38:12.189
- You've changed, Lor.

38:12.240 --> 38:14.845
- No, I haven't...

38:14.900 --> 38:17.289
Please?

38:24.170 --> 38:26.900
- You get your claws
out of your daughter

38:26.950 --> 38:29.339
or I'll see to it you
can't walk straight.

38:29.390 --> 38:32.564
- You think I can't see
the sin inside of you?

38:35.310 --> 38:38.006
- You've got no right
barging in here!

38:39.270 --> 38:40.874
- Yes, he does.

38:42.360 --> 38:43.839
- I've seen your scars, Kate.

38:43.880 --> 38:45.666
I know he put them there.

38:45.710 --> 38:48.099
- My name's Marion.

38:48.150 --> 38:50.710
- You have a new life here!
- What kind of life?

38:50.760 --> 38:52.489
I make things that
kill people.

38:52.540 --> 38:55.361
I debase God's gift,
I sing in dens of sin.

38:55.420 --> 38:58.674
I drink, smoke,
consort with deviants.

38:58.720 --> 39:00.028
- You're free!

39:00.070 --> 39:01.981
- I was seduced.

39:02.030 --> 39:04.942
And now I want
my family back.

39:11.080 --> 39:14.208
- Please, Kate!
Don't leave.

39:14.260 --> 39:16.387
I love you.

39:17.480 --> 39:19.471
Ow! Aaah!

39:19.530 --> 39:21.691
- Tell her, Marion.
Tell her!

39:21.750 --> 39:25.220
- I don't want this anymore!
And I never wanted you!

39:27.930 --> 39:30.057
Goodbye.

39:32.410 --> 39:35.140
[Crying]

40:00.390 --> 40:01.869
- After we get
to Grand Central,

40:01.920 --> 40:03.729
that give us 2 days
to find you digs

40:03.790 --> 40:05.690
before they send
me off for training.

40:05.750 --> 40:07.911
- Yes, an airtight plan.
- It is, isn't it?

40:07.970 --> 40:09.574
Must be why I'm
gasping for air.

40:09.620 --> 40:13.181
- We're doing this for
the wrong reasons, James.

40:14.930 --> 40:17.057
- The reason is that
I love you, Gumdrop.

40:17.110 --> 40:19.795
- You're not gonna have me.
You'll be God knows Where.

40:19.850 --> 40:22.671
And it may change
how you feel.

40:24.240 --> 40:26.060
- What's important,
it won't.

40:26.110 --> 40:30.763
- If that's true, then we
have nothing to worry about.

40:30.810 --> 40:34.462
I know you'll need something
to hold onto over there.

40:34.510 --> 40:38.423
As long as you want it,
you'll have it.

40:40.480 --> 40:45.429
I promise to love, honour,
and write you daily.

40:46.960 --> 40:51.090
- And I vow to have and
to hold onto my limbs.

40:51.140 --> 40:52.744
[Laughing]

40:52.790 --> 40:55.577
- I'll keep my nose clean
and your powder dry.

40:55.620 --> 41:00.182
- In trenches
and in stealth.

41:00.240 --> 41:03.789
- Till peace
do us rejoin.

41:06.280 --> 41:08.589
I'll be good.

41:08.640 --> 41:10.198
- Don't be good.

41:10.250 --> 41:12.195
Be amazing.

41:12.250 --> 41:13.410
Huh?

41:13.470 --> 41:14.630
- Mm-hmm.

41:14.680 --> 41:16.944
- We need stories
to tell each other

41:16.990 --> 41:18.298
When we're
old and grey.

41:19.990 --> 41:21.992
- You're on.

41:22.040 --> 41:23.996
- And you're
late for work.

41:24.040 --> 41:26.565
Go get your job back.

41:26.610 --> 41:28.384
Tell them your
husband-to—be

41:28.440 --> 41:29.475
needs your bombs.

41:30.960 --> 41:32.086
Here.

41:32.140 --> 41:33.698
[Keys jingling]

41:33.750 --> 41:37.004
I want you to take care of
my car for me while I'm gone.

41:37.050 --> 41:39.393
- I don't have
my license.

41:39.450 --> 41:41.270
- So drive
like you do.

41:41.320 --> 41:42.628
[Chuckling]

41:45.190 --> 41:47.010
- Need a lift?

41:52.640 --> 41:55.279
- Your hair looks
like a rats nest.

41:55.330 --> 41:57.855
- Can't close the
damned rag-top.

41:57.900 --> 42:02.109
And James enlisted.
He left this morning.

42:03.390 --> 42:05.551
- What about
the wedding?

42:05.610 --> 42:08.295
- We decided to
run on promises.

42:10.000 --> 42:12.127
What happened to you?

42:13.400 --> 42:14.958
- Kate left.

42:15.010 --> 42:18.229
I don't know where and
that's the way she wants it.

42:19.490 --> 42:21.958
- Oh, dear.

42:25.710 --> 42:28.668
- My secret's out, princess.

42:28.720 --> 42:30.927
- I know
the feeling.

42:30.980 --> 42:32.880
We're still standing.

42:32.940 --> 42:34.931
- Barely.

42:34.980 --> 42:36.504
And what about Kate?

42:36.550 --> 42:39.064
She's back where she
said she'd never go.

42:41.600 --> 42:44.683
- I'll help you find her,
make sure she's OK.

42:45.950 --> 42:48.339
And you'll help me
get my job back.

42:49.610 --> 42:51.089
- The big promise

42:51.130 --> 42:54.258
that we might actually
get the things we want.

42:56.570 --> 42:58.219
What if it's a lie?

43:00.180 --> 43:01.829
- We can't stop trying.

43:04.190 --> 43:05.703
Come on, Bets.

43:06.970 --> 43:08.619
We've got a war to win.

43:08.670 --> 43:12.970
There ain't nothin'
I can do

43:13.020 --> 43:17.059
Or nothing I can say

43:18.900 --> 43:22.631
That folk
don't criticize me

43:22.680 --> 43:25.763
But I'm gonna do
