YOUNG GIRL: Dear Santa, thank you
for the dolls and pencils and the fish.

02:12.760 --> 02:16.279
It's Easter now,
so I hope I didn't wake you.

02:16.360 --> 02:19.839
But honest, it is an emergency.

02:21.120 --> 02:23.679
There's a crack in my wall.

02:27.280 --> 02:30.959
Aunt Sharon says
it's just an ordinary crack, but...

02:31.040 --> 02:34.879
I know it's not, because...
at night, there's voices.

02:34.960 --> 02:39.279
So please, please,
could you send someone to fix it?

02:39.360 --> 02:41.519
Or a policeman. Or...

(METALLIC THRUMMING OUTSIDE)

02:48.760 --> 02:50.799

02:53.480 --> 02:54.959
Back in a moment.

03:17.640 --> 03:19.279
Thank you, Santa.

04:17.600 --> 04:19.799
Can I have an apple?

04:19.880 --> 04:23.919
All I can think about - apples.

04:24.000 --> 04:27.599
I love apples.
Maybe I'm having a craving.

04:27.680 --> 04:30.279
That's new -
never had cravings before.

04:33.440 --> 04:34.919
Whoa!

04:36.560 --> 04:38.119
Look at that!

04:38.200 --> 04:40.039
Are you OK?

04:40.160 --> 04:43.839
Just had a fall. All the way down there,
right to the library.

04:43.920 --> 04:45.079
Hell of a climb back up.

04:45.160 --> 04:47.719
- You're soaking wet.
- I was in the swimming pool.

04:47.800 --> 04:51.239
- You said you were in the library.
- So was the swimming pool.

04:51.320 --> 04:54.759
- Are you a policeman?
- Why?

04:54.840 --> 04:57.079
Did you call a policeman?

04:57.160 --> 04:59.679
Did you come about
the crack in my wall?

04:59.760 --> 05:01.919
What cra...? Argh!

05:04.040 --> 05:06.599
Are you all right, mister?

05:06.680 --> 05:09.119
No, I'm fine, it's OK.

05:09.200 --> 05:12.599
This is all perfectly norm...

05:16.440 --> 05:18.559
Who are you?

05:20.680 --> 05:23.119
I don't know yet. I'm still cooking.

05:23.200 --> 05:25.439
Does it scare you?

05:25.520 --> 05:27.359
No, it just looks a bit weird.

05:27.440 --> 05:29.319
No, no, no. The crack in your wall.

05:29.400 --> 05:32.839
- Does it scare you?
- Yes.

Early days.

05:50.800 --> 05:52.639
Steering's a bit off.

06:00.080 --> 06:03.279
If you're a doctor,
why does your box say Police?

06:11.040 --> 06:13.759
(HE COUGHS)
That's disgusting. What is that?

06:13.840 --> 06:15.879
- An apple.
- Apples are rubbish. I hate apples.

06:15.960 --> 06:17.319
You said you loved them.

06:17.400 --> 06:20.399
No, no, I love yoghurt. Yoghurt's
my favourite. Give me yoghurt.

06:31.920 --> 06:34.439
I hate yoghurt,
it's just stuff with bits in.

06:34.520 --> 06:37.479
- You said it was your favourite.
- New mouth, new rules.

06:37.560 --> 06:42.359
It's like eating after cleaning your
teeth, everything tastes...wro-agh!

06:42.440 --> 06:44.559
What is it? What's wrong with you?

06:44.640 --> 06:47.119
Wrong with me? It's not my fault.

06:47.200 --> 06:49.839
Why can't you give me decent food?
You're Scottish - fry something.

06:53.840 --> 06:55.879
Ah! Bacon!

07:02.600 --> 07:03.839
Bacon.

07:03.920 --> 07:05.479
That's bacon.

07:05.560 --> 07:08.119
Are you trying to poison me?

07:12.320 --> 07:15.399
Ah. You see? Beans.

07:18.320 --> 07:21.519
Beans are evil. Bad, bad beans.

07:23.400 --> 07:24.399
Bread and butter.

Now you're talking.

- (PLATE SMASHES, CAT MIAOWS)
- And stay out!

07:36.680 --> 07:39.439
We've got some carrots.

07:39.520 --> 07:43.039
Carrots? Are you insane?
No, wait, hang on.

07:43.120 --> 07:47.079
I know what I need.
I need...I need...I need...

07:47.160 --> 07:49.239
fish fingers and custard.

08:04.560 --> 08:07.399
- Funny.
- Am I?

08:07.480 --> 08:10.239
Good. Funny's good.

08:10.320 --> 08:12.559
- What's your name?
- Amelia Pond.

08:12.640 --> 08:14.279
Ah, that's a brilliant name.

08:14.360 --> 08:19.119
"Amelia Pond",
like a name in a fairy tale.

08:19.200 --> 08:21.319
Are we in Scotland, Amelia?

08:21.400 --> 08:23.479
No. Had to move to England.

08:23.560 --> 08:25.679
It's rubbish.

08:25.800 --> 08:29.119
So what about your mum and dad, then?
Are they upstairs?

08:29.200 --> 08:32.879
- Thought we'd have woken them by now.
- I don't have a mum and dad.

08:32.960 --> 08:34.159
Just an aunt.

08:35.960 --> 08:37.919
I don't even have an aunt.

08:38.000 --> 08:39.599
You're lucky.

08:39.680 --> 08:41.519
I know.

08:43.320 --> 08:45.399
So, your aunt.

08:45.480 --> 08:47.679
Where is she?

08:47.760 --> 08:49.359
She's out.

08:50.360 --> 08:51.799
And she left you all alone?

08:51.880 --> 08:54.439
- I'm not scared.
- You're not scared of anything!

08:54.520 --> 08:58.959
Box falls out of the sky, man falls
out of box, man eats fish custard,

08:59.040 --> 09:02.759
and look at you,
just sitting there.

09:03.880 --> 09:07.599
- So you know what I think?
- What?

09:09.120 --> 09:11.919
Must be a hell of a scary crack
in your wall.

09:23.400 --> 09:25.679
You've had some cowboys in here.

09:25.760 --> 09:28.559
Not actualcowboys,

09:28.640 --> 09:30.599
though that can happen.

09:30.680 --> 09:35.559
I used to hate apples,
so my mum put faces on them.

09:43.080 --> 09:46.479
She sounds good, your mum.
I'll keep it for later.

09:48.560 --> 09:52.039
This wall is solid and the crack
doesn't go all the way through it.

09:53.240 --> 09:56.759
So here's a thing -
where's the draught coming from?

09:59.480 --> 10:02.799
Wibbly-wobbly, timey-wimey.
You know what the crack is?

10:02.880 --> 10:03.879
What?

10:03.960 --> 10:06.119
It's a crack.

10:09.640 --> 10:12.759
I'll tell you something funny.
If you knocked this wall down,

10:12.840 --> 10:16.039
the crack would stay put,
cos the crack isn't in the wall.

10:16.120 --> 10:19.159
- Where is it, then?
- Everywhere.

10:19.240 --> 10:22.359
In everything. It's a split
in the skin of the world.

10:24.480 --> 10:27.519
Two parts of space and time
that should never have touched,

10:27.600 --> 10:29.399
pressed together...

10:31.520 --> 10:34.199
...right here in the wall
of your bedroom.

10:34.280 --> 10:36.639
- Sometimes, can you hear...?
- A voice.

10:36.720 --> 10:38.439
Yes.

10:38.520 --> 10:40.479
(ECHOING VOICE)

10:50.080 --> 10:52.519
Prisoner Zero has escaped.

10:52.600 --> 10:55.479
- Prisoner Zero?
- "Prisoner Zero has escaped."

10:55.560 --> 10:57.959
That's what I heard.
What does it mean?

11:00.160 --> 11:02.599
Prisoner Zero has escaped.

11:02.680 --> 11:06.719
It means that, on the other side
of this wall, there's a prison

11:06.800 --> 11:09.479
and they've lost a prisoner.
Do you know what that means?

11:09.560 --> 11:12.279
- What?
- You need a better wall.

11:12.360 --> 11:15.199
The only way to close the breach
is to open it all the way.

11:15.280 --> 11:17.879
The forces will invert
and it'll snap itself shut.

11:19.760 --> 11:22.359
- Or...
- What?

11:22.440 --> 11:26.119
You know when grown-ups tell you
everything's going to be fine

11:26.200 --> 11:28.919
and you think they're probably lying
to make you feel better?

11:29.000 --> 11:30.119
Yes.

11:30.200 --> 11:33.439
Everything's going to be fine.

11:52.720 --> 12:00.359
Prisoner Zero has escaped.

12:00.440 --> 12:02.359
Hello?

12:03.440 --> 12:04.919
Hello!

12:09.440 --> 12:11.439
What's that?

12:20.240 --> 12:23.799
There. You see, told you it would close.
Good as new.

12:23.880 --> 12:27.199
What was that thing?
Was that Prisoner Zero?

12:27.280 --> 12:30.119
No. I think that was
Prisoner Zero's guard.

12:30.200 --> 12:33.279
Whatever it was, it sent me
a message. Psychic paper -

12:33.360 --> 12:35.799
takes a lovely little message.

12:35.880 --> 12:38.439
"Prisoner Zero has escaped."

12:38.520 --> 12:39.999
But why tell us?

12:42.480 --> 12:44.039
Unless...

12:44.120 --> 12:46.319
Unless what?

12:46.400 --> 12:49.559
Unless Prisoner Zero
escaped through here.

12:49.640 --> 12:51.839
But he couldn't have.

12:51.920 --> 12:53.639
We'd know.

12:59.680 --> 13:02.239
It's difficult.
Brand-new me, nothing works yet.

13:02.320 --> 13:04.719
But there's something
I'm missing...

13:07.200 --> 13:09.999

13:12.560 --> 13:14.119
...of my eye.

13:31.080 --> 13:32.199
But...

13:34.120 --> 13:35.239
...it's just a box!

13:35.320 --> 13:37.559
- How can a box have engines?
- It's not a box.

13:37.640 --> 13:40.359
It's a time machine.

13:40.440 --> 13:43.399
What, a real one?

13:43.480 --> 13:45.679
You've got a real time machine?

13:45.760 --> 13:47.919
Not for much longer
if I can't get her stabilised.

13:48.000 --> 13:51.279
Five-minute hop into the future
should do it.

13:51.360 --> 13:52.759
Can I come?

13:52.840 --> 13:55.999
Not safe in here, not yet. Five minutes.
Give me five minutes.

13:56.080 --> 13:57.399
I'll be right back.

13:59.040 --> 14:01.399
People always say that.

14:06.920 --> 14:08.359

Yeah. Amelia. Little Scottish girl.
Where is she?

18:38.800 --> 18:41.479
I promised her five minutes
but the engines were phasing.

18:41.560 --> 18:46.279

I can't be six months late!

19:02.080 --> 19:03.799

about your conversation.

20:18.320 --> 20:20.519
And this is where I live!
You got a problem with that?

20:22.040 --> 20:23.359
How many rooms?

20:23.440 --> 20:25.479
- I'm sorry, what?
- On this floor.

20:25.560 --> 20:26.799
How many rooms on this floor?
Count them.

20:26.880 --> 20:27.919
Why?

20:28.000 --> 20:30.839
Because it will change your life.

20:32.720 --> 20:33.999
Five.

20:34.080 --> 20:36.159
- One, two, three, four, five.
- Six.

20:36.240 --> 20:38.959
- Six?
- Look.

20:39.080 --> 20:41.439
- Look where?
- Exactly where you never want to look.

20:41.520 --> 20:43.839
The corner of your eye. Look behind you.

20:56.560 --> 20:59.119
That's... That is not possible.

20:59.200 --> 21:00.759
How's that possible?

21:00.840 --> 21:04.399
There's a perception filter all round
the door. Sensed it last time I was here.

21:04.480 --> 21:05.599
Should've seen it.

21:05.680 --> 21:09.719
But that's a whole room. That's
a whole room I've never even noticed.

21:09.840 --> 21:12.879
The filter stops you noticing.
Something came here a while ago to hide.

21:12.960 --> 21:15.919
It's still hiding
and you need to uncuff me now!

21:17.200 --> 21:21.239
- I don't have the key. I lost it.
- How can you have lost it?!

21:21.320 --> 21:23.679
Stay away from that door!

21:25.760 --> 21:28.159
Do not touch that door!

21:28.240 --> 21:30.719
Listen to me! Do not open that...

21:30.800 --> 21:33.399
Why does no-one ever listen to me?

21:33.480 --> 21:36.119
Do I just have a face
that nobody listens to?

21:36.200 --> 21:38.559
Again?

21:39.760 --> 21:43.079
My screwdriver, where is it? Silver thing,
blue at the end. Where did it go?

21:44.280 --> 21:47.319
- There's nothing here.
- Whatever's in there stopped you seeing

21:47.440 --> 21:50.239
the whole room -
what makes you think you could see it?

21:50.320 --> 21:52.439
Now, please, just get out!

21:52.520 --> 21:55.719
- Silver, blue at the end?
- My screwdriver, yeah.

21:55.800 --> 21:56.919
It's here.

21:57.000 --> 21:58.959
Must have rolled under the door.

22:00.320 --> 22:03.119
Yeah. Must have.

22:09.480 --> 22:12.999
And then it must have jumped up
on the table.

22:15.480 --> 22:17.279
Get out of there.

22:19.320 --> 22:21.559
Get out of there!

22:23.400 --> 22:26.119
Get out!

22:28.600 --> 22:30.479
Get out of there!

22:38.960 --> 22:41.319
What is it? What are you doing?

22:41.400 --> 22:43.959
There's nothing here, but...

22:45.160 --> 22:46.399
Corner of your eye.

22:48.920 --> 22:50.319
What is it?

22:50.400 --> 22:53.759
Don't try to see it. If it knows
you've seen it, it will kill you.

22:53.840 --> 22:55.719
Don't look at it.

22:55.800 --> 22:58.799
Do not...look.

22:58.880 --> 23:00.279
- (SHE SCREAMS)
- Get out!

23:02.520 --> 23:04.319
Give me that!

23:06.840 --> 23:07.999
(LATCH CLICKS)

23:10.400 --> 23:13.239
Come on. What's the bad alien done to you?

23:13.320 --> 23:16.519
- Will that door hold it?
- Oh, yeah, yeah, course!

23:16.600 --> 23:19.079
It's an inter-dimensional multi-form
from outer space -

23:19.160 --> 23:21.399
they're all terrified of wood (!)

23:23.640 --> 23:25.879
What's that? What's it doing?

23:29.000 --> 23:31.959
I don't know. Getting dressed?
Run. Just go.

23:32.040 --> 23:34.719
- Your back-up's coming, I'll be fine.
- There is no back-up.

23:34.800 --> 23:37.639
- I heard you call for back-up.
- It's a pretend radio.

23:37.720 --> 23:41.919
- But you're a policewoman.
- I'm a kissogram!

23:50.400 --> 23:53.639
- But it's just...
- No, it isn't.

23:53.720 --> 23:55.959
Look at the faces.

23:56.040 --> 23:58.159

24:02.800 --> 24:06.359
What? I'm sorry, but what?!

24:06.440 --> 24:08.599
It's all one creature.
One creature disguised as two.

24:08.680 --> 24:11.679
Clever old multi-form.

24:11.760 --> 24:15.519
A bit of a rush job, though.
Got the voice a bit muddled, did you?

24:16.920 --> 24:19.039
Mind you, where did you get
the pattern from?

24:19.120 --> 24:21.999
You'd need a psychic link, a live feed.
How did you fix that?

24:47.320 --> 24:50.919
Her and me, we're safe.
Want to know why? She sent for back-up.

24:51.000 --> 24:52.519
I didn't send for back-up!

24:52.600 --> 24:56.439
I know. That was a clever lie to save
our lives. OK, yeah, no back-up!

24:56.520 --> 24:58.599
That's why we're safe.
Alone, we're not a threat to you.

24:58.680 --> 25:02.279
If we had back-up,
then you'd have to kill us!

25:02.360 --> 25:05.639
VOICE: Attention, Prisoner Zero.
The human residence is surrounded.

25:05.720 --> 25:08.759
- Attention Prisoner Zero...
- What's that?

25:08.880 --> 25:10.639
- ...the human residence is surrounded.
- That would be back-up. OK,

25:10.720 --> 25:14.479
one more time. We do have back-up
and that's definitely why we're safe.

25:14.560 --> 25:16.079
Prisoner Zero will vacate
the human residence,

25:16.160 --> 25:18.639
or the human residence
will be incinerated.

25:18.720 --> 25:22.239
Safe apart from,
you know, incineration.

25:22.320 --> 25:25.639
Prisoner Zero will vacate
the human residence,

25:25.720 --> 25:28.479

residence, or the human residence

- Run!

...the human residence, or the human
residence will be incinerated.

25:49.360 --> 25:51.039
- Kissogram?
- Yes, a kissogram!

25:51.120 --> 25:52.839
Why do you pretend
to be a policewoman?

25:52.920 --> 25:54.879
You broke into my house!
It was this or a French maid!

25:54.960 --> 25:57.639
What's going on? Tell me!

25:58.840 --> 26:00.239
Tell me!

26:00.280 --> 26:03.639
An alien convict is hiding in your spare
room disguised as a man and a dog,

26:03.720 --> 26:06.399
and some other aliens are about to
incinerate your house. Any questions?

26:06.480 --> 26:07.519
- Yes.
- Me, too.

26:07.600 --> 26:12.559
No, no, no! Don't do that, not now!
It's still rebuilding, not letting us in!

26:12.640 --> 26:15.559
Prisoner Zero will vacate
the human residence...

26:15.640 --> 26:16.959
Come on!

26:17.040 --> 26:20.959
No, wait, hang on, hang on,
wait, wait, wait. The shed.

26:21.040 --> 26:23.919
I destroyed that shed last time
I was here, smashed it to pieces.

26:24.000 --> 26:26.559
- So there's a new one. Let's go.
- But the new one's got old.

26:26.640 --> 26:28.839
It's ten years old at least.

26:28.920 --> 26:32.119

I'm 1 2 years late.

26:32.200 --> 26:33.759
- He's coming.
- You said six months.

26:33.840 --> 26:35.519
- Why did you say six months?
- We've got to go.

26:35.600 --> 26:39.159
This matters. This is important.
Why did you say six months?

26:39.240 --> 26:41.679
(SCOTTISH ACCENT) Well,
why did you say five minutes?!

26:42.800 --> 26:45.719

- Come on.

What?

- Come on!
- What?

the human residence,

26:51.440 --> 26:54.239

- You're Amelia.
- You're late.

- Amelia Pond. You're the little girl.
- I'm Amelia and you're late.

27:05.520 --> 27:06.519
- What happened?
- 1 2 years.

27:06.600 --> 27:08.679
- You hit me with a cricket bat.
- 1 2 years.

27:08.760 --> 27:11.359
- A cricket bat.
- 1 2 years and four psychiatrists.

27:11.440 --> 27:14.079
- Four?
- I kept biting them.

27:14.160 --> 27:16.039
- Why?
- They said you weren't real.

Hello, Amy, dear.
Are you a policewoman now?

28:31.160 --> 28:34.599
- Well, sometimes...
- I thought you were a nurse.

28:34.680 --> 28:37.759
I can be a nurse.

28:37.840 --> 28:40.959
- Or, actually, a nun?
- I dabble.

Amy, who is your friend?

28:46.000 --> 28:49.079
- Who's Amy? You were Amelia.
- Yeah, now I'm Amy.

I know you, don't I?

28:57.680 --> 29:00.519
I've seen you somewhere before.

29:00.600 --> 29:03.519
Not me. Brand-new face...

First time on.
And what sort ofjob's a kissogram?

29:06.640 --> 29:09.599
I go to parties and I kiss people.

29:11.880 --> 29:13.719
With outfits. It's a laugh.

- You're worse than my aunt.

- I don't know. There's never any ducks.

31:39.560 --> 31:41.399
Then how do you know it's a duck pond?

31:41.480 --> 31:43.719
It just is.
Is it important, the duck pond?

31:43.800 --> 31:45.359
I don't know. Why would I know?

- Nothing.
