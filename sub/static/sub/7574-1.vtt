00:14.305 --> 00:16.601
Should we be doing this?
It's still a crime scene.

00:16.643 --> 00:19.900
Sack up, Billy. It's called
"investigative journalism" for a reason.

00:19.942 --> 00:22.989
Yeah, but don't we need a press pass
or a permit or something?

00:23.031 --> 00:25.118
Press pass this!

00:25.159 --> 00:28.499
You know, the police missed
something here, I can feel it.

00:28.541 --> 00:32.048
What do you say, Billy? Won't a Peabody
Award look great up on your...

00:58.850 --> 01:01.980
-Yo, Chuck, speed up, man!
-Yeah, man, speed up.

01:02.022 --> 01:05.236
Guys, this is my dad's car.
So if I go any faster, he will kill me.

01:05.279 --> 01:06.866
- Holy shit!

01:07.617 --> 01:09.161
- Shit!
- Jesus, that was close.

01:09.204 --> 01:10.706
You fucking assholes!

01:10.748 --> 01:13.794
We are in hillbilly country now, boys.
Squeal like a pig!

01:15.424 --> 01:18.262
Chad, just cos they're not in your
fraternity doesn't mean they're freaks.

01:18.346 --> 01:22.729
Actually, it does, Allison. You see,
you're either Omega Beta or you're a freak.

01:22.812 --> 01:25.067
- Omega Beta! Omega Beta!
- Fuck.

01:25.108 --> 01:28.114
I'm in a oar full of morons.

01:28.156 --> 01:31.371
No, if we were morons,
we wouldn't have thought to bring this.

01:31.997 --> 01:34.585
OK, I stand corrected.
You are a fucking genius.

01:34.627 --> 01:37.216
Hey, Chuck, speed up, man.
They're gonna pass us.

01:37.258 --> 01:38.635
Oh, jeez. Whoa, Jesus.

01:48.195 --> 01:50.909
Did you see the way
those guys looked at us?

01:51.410 --> 01:53.372
Hey, guys! Guys!

01:55.125 --> 01:56.711
We forgot the beer!

01:56.752 --> 01:58.464
No!

02:33.491 --> 02:39.001
Sure you got everything
you need? Cos once you get up there...

02:46.182 --> 02:47.894
Can I help you?

02:49.230 --> 02:51.609
Uh, yeah. Where's your beer at?

02:53.279 --> 02:54.490
Beer's in the back.

03:01.044 --> 03:02.755
You see the way them kids looked?

03:06.388 --> 03:10.437
- Read that list back to me.
- OK, three-quarter-inch nails,

03:10.479 --> 03:13.735
hacksaw, baling hooks,

03:13.776 --> 03:17.284
brush-clearing Scythe, clamps...

03:17.326 --> 03:19.121
Hey, Chad, do we need more bug...

03:19.204 --> 03:21.709
- crosscutting handsaw...
- Chad?

03:21.792 --> 03:24.047
- Lubricated condoms...
- Chad?

03:24.130 --> 03:25.549
Hand drill...

03:29.683 --> 03:34.400
Feminine napkins, stone bit, one-eighth hole saw...

03:35.318 --> 03:37.030
- Oh, my God!
- It's just me.

03:37.072 --> 03:41.498
Let's get out of here.
This place is so creepy.

03:48.468 --> 03:52.102
- Dale, we need anything else?
- Pickled eggs. Six-pounder.

03:54.397 --> 03:57.903
Oh, hot dog, Tucker. Have you ever
seen anything like that in your life?

03:59.155 --> 04:02.079
There's nothing so special about them.

04:02.121 --> 04:06.462
- They're just your average college girls.
- Nothing average about that.

04:06.504 --> 04:08.090
You know something, Dale?

04:08.132 --> 04:10.595
She's just human.
Why don't you go over and talk to her?

04:10.637 --> 04:14.019
Talk to her? What?
What in the world would I say?

04:14.060 --> 04:19.320
I don't know. Tell her that you got a vacation
home. That'll probably impress her.

04:19.361 --> 04:22.035
Are you out of your mind, Tucker?
These are college girls.

04:22.076 --> 04:25.499
They grew up with vacation homes,
and guys like me fixing their toilets.

04:25.541 --> 04:28.713
You gotta have some faith in yourself, man.
Girls can smell fear.

04:28.755 --> 04:31.677
Now come on!
You are a good-lookin' man...

04:31.719 --> 04:33.139
more or less.

04:33.181 --> 04:34.516
You got a damn good heart.

04:34.558 --> 04:36.145
Yup.

04:36.187 --> 04:39.693
I mean, that's two things right there.
Now, go on, get over there.

04:39.777 --> 04:41.738
What's the worst that could happen?

04:44.745 --> 04:45.789
You know something?

04:47.375 --> 04:50.839
- You're right, Tuck. I'm gonna do it.
- All right.

04:50.881 --> 04:53.260
- I'm gonna do it right now.
- All right, hold up.

04:53.302 --> 04:57.770
All right, now, whatever you say,
just smile and laugh.

04:57.812 --> 04:59.356
It shows confidence.

04:59.398 --> 05:02.612
Smile and laugh. OK.

05:03.572 --> 05:04.658
- Do it.
- All right.

05:20.355 --> 05:23.360
You guys, uh...goin' campin'?

05:26.825 --> 05:31.710
Hey! Hey. Now, look...
we don't want any trouble, all right?

05:31.752 --> 05:33.547
- So just...back off.
- Whoa!

05:33.589 --> 05:35.050
- OK. OK. I'm sorry.
- Back off!

05:37.846 --> 05:38.974
Get in the truck.

05:41.897 --> 05:44.651
That's a-a good-lookin' cooler...

05:54.003 --> 05:57.676
I told you, Tucker. I'm a zero with the ladies.

05:59.472 --> 06:00.934
They hate my face!

06:01.476 --> 06:02.853
Come on.

06:09.574 --> 06:13.750
I ain't like you, Tucker, you know?
I can't talk to the lady folk the way you can.

06:13.792 --> 06:16.296
No one can. I mean, I...

06:16.338 --> 06:20.470
I always get all stupid, and my hands get
clammy, and I just act like a big fat idiot.

06:20.512 --> 06:24.228
You know what your problem is?
You got an inferiority complex.

06:24.270 --> 06:25.815
No, I don't.

06:25.857 --> 06:27.526
- Yeah, yeah.
- No.

06:27.568 --> 06:30.866
Let me tell you something, life is short.
You got to go after what you want.

06:30.907 --> 06:32.243
Mm-hm.

06:32.285 --> 06:35.667
Cos it sure as hell
ain't gonna just fall right in your lap.

06:35.709 --> 06:37.336
- That's true, I reckon.
- Aw, shit.

06:37.379 --> 06:39.842
- What are you doing?
- Shit, shit. We got a cop.

06:39.884 --> 06:41.428
Oh, I got you.

06:41.470 --> 06:44.685
I got a rag. Move your arm.
You spilled beer all over your crotch.

06:44.768 --> 06:46.688
All right, he's pulling over.

06:47.565 --> 06:48.901
- Get up, Dale.
- I can't.

06:48.942 --> 06:51.614
- Dale, he's coming.
- No, it's stuck on my sleeve.

06:51.656 --> 06:52.992
- Get up.
- My hand is stuck on...

06:53.034 --> 06:55.623
Un-stuck it, then.
He's out of his car.

06:55.664 --> 06:57.459
- He's out of his car?
- He's coming.

06:57.501 --> 06:59.254
- Tucker!
- Get it...

07:04.055 --> 07:05.474
Yeah.

07:07.979 --> 07:09.983
- Howdy, Officer.
- Hey.

07:10.025 --> 07:13.615
- It's a beautiful day, isn't it?
- Yeah.

07:13.657 --> 07:14.700
License, please.

07:15.536 --> 07:19.585
Uh, I lost my wallet a couple weeks back.
New one is in the mail.

07:22.173 --> 07:23.717
Temporary.

07:23.760 --> 07:25.388
Where you two headed?

07:25.429 --> 07:28.687
We're headed to our vacation home
up by Morris Lake.

07:30.356 --> 07:32.735
I sank every penny I had into it.

07:32.777 --> 07:36.284
Me and Dale here, we're gonna go fix 'er up,
maybe do a little fishin'.

07:36.325 --> 07:39.248
- Do a little fishin'.
- He's been striking out with the ladies.

07:39.290 --> 07:42.171
I figured a little man time
might do him some good.

07:43.089 --> 07:49.100
There ain't nothing up there but pain and
suffering on a scale you can't even imagine.

07:53.484 --> 07:55.821
I pulled you over cos
you got a broken turn signal.

07:55.864 --> 07:57.533
Oh, yes, sir.

07:58.744 --> 08:00.371
See that you, uh...

08:02.710 --> 08:03.962
get that fixed.

08:04.046 --> 08:05.966
That was very helpful.

08:12.479 --> 08:15.735
- Man, that was tense.
- That dude's weird.

08:15.777 --> 08:17.029
There he goes.

08:17.906 --> 08:19.200
Bye _

08:20.202 --> 08:22.957
God, would you look at him?
You know what his problem is?

08:22.998 --> 08:25.964
He was jealous because
he can't afford a place of his own.

08:26.005 --> 08:28.260
Well...

08:28.301 --> 08:31.766
Here's to the good life, huh?

08:33.477 --> 08:36.149
- Oh, yeah.
- To the good life, man.

08:51.429 --> 08:55.269
I mean, what's a parasite?
Oh, look at this little truck right here!

08:55.312 --> 08:58.109
- I know, I know.
- Is that ours?

08:58.151 --> 09:00.113
- Wow. And another one right there.

09:17.479 --> 09:19.400
Oh, my God.

09:21.153 --> 09:22.614
It's perfect!

09:22.657 --> 09:25.495
- And what did they call this, a fixer-upper?
- Yeah.

09:26.747 --> 09:29.378
- All right, let's go check it out inside.
- Yeah.

09:29.419 --> 09:32.634
I can't believe this is ours! Oh, my God!

09:40.692 --> 09:43.905
- 'ell, it's just a little dusty is all.
- It's a mansion!

09:54.927 --> 09:58.934
Whoever used to live here must have been
an archaeologist or something.

09:58.976 --> 10:01.731
Yeah, archae... Yeah.

10:01.772 --> 10:04.946
Look at this.
Must have been a real news junkie, too.

10:10.915 --> 10:17.011
Chubby's Chili Dog Depot?
Buy three, get two free. No expiration date.

10:17.053 --> 10:20.309
- All right.
- Score!

10:20.351 --> 10:24.317
Tucker, look! They got my favorite
board game here, too.

10:24.359 --> 10:28.075
You know what?
I tell you something, Dale.

10:28.116 --> 10:31.665
I cannot believe that I am standing
in my own vacation home right now.

10:31.706 --> 10:33.918
You know something?

10:34.878 --> 10:37.342
Dreams really do come true.

10:37.384 --> 10:38.636
Look out!

10:40.139 --> 10:43.061
Well , I guess we should fix that.

10:43.103 --> 10:45.357
Yeah, that's a good idea.

10:47.529 --> 10:48.906
You can get off me now.

10:49.574 --> 10:52.496
If you have a reoccurring dream about
sucking a dick but never do it, are you gay?

10:52.538 --> 10:54.082
- Yes.
- Really?

10:54.124 --> 10:55.292
- Guys!
- Are you serious?

10:55.334 --> 10:57.799
- What?
- You guys want to hear a scary story?

10:57.841 --> 11:00.094
- No!
- Chuck, no.

11:00.136 --> 11:01.973
- Absolutely not.
- That's not funny.

11:02.014 --> 11:05.062
- You're such a liar.
- It happened to my cousins, I think.

11:05.104 --> 11:09.279
Now, do you fuckers
want to hear a real story? Huh?

11:11.867 --> 11:17.669
This story happened right here,
right in these very woods.

11:19.924 --> 11:22.137
It was 20 years ago today.

11:28.023 --> 11:29.902
The Memorial Day Massacre.

11:30.695 --> 11:35.370
How a bunch of college kids...
just like us...

11:35.412 --> 11:38.125
they came out here to have a good time...

11:39.169 --> 11:45.891
but little did they know that they weren't
the only ones in these here woods.

11:48.813 --> 11:51.443
J` Pump it up
J` While your feet are stompin’

11:51.485 --> 11:53.447
J` And the jam is pumpin’...

11:55.576 --> 11:56.829
J` Pump it up a little more

11:56.870 --> 11:59.333
J` Get the party going on the dance Hoof

11:59.375 --> 12:01.838
J` See, cos that’s where the...

12:01.879 --> 12:04.260
Get another one! Come on!

12:04.343 --> 12:07.099
J` I’m gonna meet my maker

12:07.182 --> 12:09.770
J` I ain’t afraid to die

12:09.812 --> 12:14.155
- Hey, what the hell are you doing?
- Yeah, put that back on.

12:14.196 --> 12:16.451
No, no.
This is cool, I like this.

12:56.986 --> 12:59.742
Only one person lived to tell this story.

13:01.078 --> 13:03.290
The rest of them just disappeared...

13:04.584 --> 13:07.507
and their bodies are buried beneath us.

13:10.054 --> 13:13.268
Hey! Hey! There's a lake back there.

13:13.309 --> 13:15.397
Who wants to go skinny dipping?

13:15.438 --> 13:17.943
- I do.
- Yeah.

13:17.985 --> 13:21.325
- All right.
- I'm not getting naked.

13:30.426 --> 13:32.472
That's OK, Tuck.

13:32.514 --> 13:34.309
You take that. That's yours.

13:35.686 --> 13:37.982
That's why you're never gonna
get ahead in life.

13:38.024 --> 13:40.738
It's cos you don't stick up for yourself.

13:42.700 --> 13:45.581
Do not even think about it.

13:45.623 --> 13:48.085
- But you just said...
- Are you kidding me?

13:48.753 --> 13:50.298
Are you serious?

13:52.259 --> 13:53.304
What'd I just say?

13:53.346 --> 13:57.019
- You said I gotta stick up for myself.
- I said, "Don't even think about it", though.

13:57.061 --> 13:58.689
That was the last thing I said.

14:05.954 --> 14:06.997
Hello?

14:08.208 --> 14:10.504
Is someone there?

14:11.171 --> 14:12.507
Guys?

14:17.183 --> 14:18.686
Yargh!

14:18.728 --> 14:21.608
God, Chad! What the hell are you doing?

14:21.650 --> 14:24.655
- You are such an asshole.
- Come on, that was funny.

14:24.698 --> 14:26.159
No, it wasn't.

14:26.201 --> 14:28.706
You got nothing to worry about, Allie.
It's just me.

14:28.747 --> 14:30.668
You totally freaked me out.

14:32.421 --> 14:34.633
You know, you can drop the act now.

14:35.468 --> 14:38.683
- What act?
- Like you're better than everyone else.

14:40.102 --> 14:42.064
- I don't think...
- Yeah, you do.

14:42.106 --> 14:45.279
But that's OK, Allie, because I get it.

14:46.071 --> 14:49.078
I mean, you are better than everyone else.

14:50.623 --> 14:52.376
You and I, Allie...

14:52.418 --> 14:56.091
are cut from a different cloth.
You know what I mean?

14:56.133 --> 14:59.223
- I'm not... I...
- All I'm saying is...

15:01.393 --> 15:05.067
I'm glad that we have this chance
to get to know each other better.

15:08.156 --> 15:09.911
Chad, you're drunk.

15:09.953 --> 15:13.375
That's a good thing. It lowers my inhibitions.

15:14.962 --> 15:16.464
OK, uh...

15:16.506 --> 15:18.802
- Come on, stop.
- Why?

15:18.843 --> 15:20.554
Why? Why stop?

15:21.432 --> 15:23.270
We're perfect for each other.

15:25.357 --> 15:29.030
Let's talk about this later.
I'm gonna go catch up with everyone.

15:29.114 --> 15:31.117
Come on, Allie. Come on...

15:33.622 --> 15:36.461
- Oh, it's so cold!
- Here we go!

15:38.465 --> 15:40.302
What’s that all about?

15:42.222 --> 15:45.145
I don't know,
but I think we should go check it out.

15:45.186 --> 15:47.357
No. No, Tuck, you know what?

15:47.399 --> 15:50.279
My guess would be that they
don't really want to see us right now.

15:50.322 --> 15:54.038
- Yeah, I kind of want to see them.
- No, no.

15:55.039 --> 15:56.709
What the hell are you doing?

15:59.798 --> 16:00.883
- Damn it, Dale!
- What?

16:00.924 --> 16:03.472
I'm not gonna go around
one more time with you on this.

16:03.555 --> 16:05.351
- OK.
- Hush.

16:05.392 --> 16:09.859
I love camping!

16:11.988 --> 16:13.407
Look.

16:16.915 --> 16:18.793
Oh.

16:24.261 --> 16:25.347
- Tucker!
- Shush!

16:30.148 --> 16:32.611
God damn it, Dale!
What the hell is the matter with you?

16:32.653 --> 16:34.281
Me? What did I do?

16:34.323 --> 16:37.579
When you see a college girl prancing
around in front of you half-naked,

16:37.621 --> 16:42.046
- you do not yell out my name.
- Well, you were being a Peeping Tom.

16:42.088 --> 16:44.759
You are hopeless,
do you know that? You're hopeless.

16:47.557 --> 16:48.852
She didn't come up yet.

16:50.646 --> 16:52.442
- Tuck, paddle.
- Oh, Jesus.

16:54.194 --> 16:57.617
Hey! Lady?

16:58.828 --> 17:00.458
Hey, lady!

17:00.499 --> 17:04.381
- Where'd she go, Tuck?
- Whoa, whoa, Dale!

17:07.178 --> 17:11.145
Help me get her in the boat! Come on!

17:11.979 --> 17:13.440
Get her legs!

17:13.482 --> 17:16.029
Oh! No!

17:16.070 --> 17:19.034
- Hey, we got your friend!
- Oh, God!

17:19.076 --> 17:22.665
They got Allison! Come on!

17:24.545 --> 17:25.798
Hey!

17:26.883 --> 17:29.721
We got your friend! Why the hell
are they running away? Hey!

17:29.763 --> 17:33.604
Doesn't matter, Tucker, we gotta get her
back to the cabin. Come on, let's row.

17:33.646 --> 17:36.235
- Shit!
- Oh, man.

17:37.152 --> 17:39.699
Shit.

17:40.492 --> 17:42.454
Chad! Chad!

17:42.496 --> 17:44.668
The hillbillies...

17:44.709 --> 17:46.922
- What hillbillies?
- From the store!

17:46.964 --> 17:48.883
They captured Allison!

17:58.862 --> 18:00.072
Allie!

18:33.637 --> 18:35.724
Oh, God! No.

18:35.766 --> 18:40.024
- No, please! No, please, don't...
- Don't...don't cry.

18:40.066 --> 18:41.443
Please don't cut me open!

18:42.780 --> 18:47.997
Oh! It's the pancakes! You hate pancakes!
I'll go make you something else. I'll just...

18:48.039 --> 18:50.086
Doesn't like pancakes.

18:50.169 --> 18:53.467
Should have asked her if she liked
pancakes. Big fat stupid idiot!

18:55.178 --> 18:57.015
Pa... Pancakes?

19:00.104 --> 19:01.274
Allison!

19:01.315 --> 19:03.486
I don't understand.
Where do you think they took her?

19:03.528 --> 19:07.201
- Maybe they took her to the hospital.
- You don't get it, do you?

19:07.243 --> 19:09.247
Chuck, tell him what you saw.

19:09.289 --> 19:12.713
Well, it was really dark,
but it looked like one of the guys was...

19:12.754 --> 19:14.674
Like...eating her face off.

19:15.885 --> 19:17.722
That is so disgusting.

19:17.763 --> 19:19.893
Not to sound too cliché,
but shouldn't we go to the police?

19:19.934 --> 19:21.562
And just leave Allison with them?

19:21.604 --> 19:23.567
If they already ate her,
what difference does it make?

19:23.609 --> 19:26.948
We don't need the police.
We can handle this on our own.

19:27.032 --> 19:31.080
What if I go? It's my dad's truck. He told me
I was the only one allowed to drive it.

19:31.122 --> 19:33.001
Fine. You wanna go, Chuck? Then just go.

19:33.084 --> 19:35.965
OK, awesome. I'll be back in a jiffy, I swear.

19:36.592 --> 19:39.430
That's such bullshit.
Why does he get to go?

19:47.655 --> 19:50.577
Hey, guys!
You better come look at this.

19:54.501 --> 19:56.506
What is this place?

19:56.548 --> 20:00.012
It's just a cabin.
It doesn't mean they're psycho killers.

20:00.054 --> 20:03.142
Oh, yeah? Then why don't you
go in there and talk to them?

20:03.184 --> 20:05.146
All right. Maybe I will.

20:08.612 --> 20:09.990
I said maybe.

20:30.487 --> 20:36.081
There you go. Please don't tell me
that you hate eggs and bacon.

20:38.502 --> 20:40.758
Wha-What am I doing here?

20:40.799 --> 20:44.056
Oh, you don't remember?
OK. Uh...

20:44.097 --> 20:46.727
Well, me and Tucker...

20:46.769 --> 20:49.065
I mean, uh, I and Tuck...

20:49.815 --> 20:50.818
Well...

20:50.902 --> 20:56.663
- Tucker and I brung you here last night.
- Why?

20:56.704 --> 20:59.585
Because you were about
to go swimming with your friends,

20:59.627 --> 21:02.549
and you climbed up on a bunch of rocks,
and you fell and banged your head

21:02.591 --> 21:05.054
and then you fell into the water,
and then...

21:05.096 --> 21:07.558
I dove in and rescued you.

21:08.727 --> 21:13.153
- Wait, you...you were spying on us?
- No. No, what? No!

21:13.195 --> 21:15.408
No, we weren't spying.
No, I swear to God, no, no.

21:15.449 --> 21:18.162
We were out there fishin'. OK?
I didn't... We didn't see...

21:18.204 --> 21:21.127
I didn't see...
Maybe Tucker might have seen a little...

21:21.168 --> 21:22.671
Where are my friends?

21:22.713 --> 21:26.805
- They ran off into the woods.
- They just left me?

21:26.847 --> 21:29.142
Yeah, but don't be mad at them.

21:29.184 --> 21:32.356
Some people just aren't any good in a crisis,

21:32.398 --> 21:35.280
and that's why Tucker and I brung you here,

21:35.322 --> 21:38.118
hoping that they would
come get you in the morning.

21:40.164 --> 21:43.127
I didn't have any girlie clothes, so...

21:43.169 --> 21:45.048
It's OK, I...

21:45.089 --> 21:47.511
I never really had much fashion sense,
anyway.

21:47.553 --> 21:49.932
- Me neither.
- Yeah.

21:52.228 --> 21:56.613
That's my dog, Jangers. He looks mean,
but he's just a big old marshmallow.

21:56.655 --> 21:58.783
You can just pet him round the nose.

21:59.534 --> 22:00.953
- He's drooling.
- I know.

22:01.914 --> 22:06.004
Anyway, um...I'm sorry
about all the mess around here.

22:06.047 --> 22:09.136
Tucker just bought this place,
and, uh...you know...

22:10.305 --> 22:13.728
Yeah, I'm sure it doesn't look like much
to a high-class girl like you,

22:13.812 --> 22:18.446
but we've always just had sort of
a dream to have our own vacation home.

22:19.407 --> 22:21.159
But, uh...anyway...

22:22.453 --> 22:25.084
you should relax and rest, OK?

22:25.126 --> 22:27.630
Hey, what's...
what's your name?

22:27.672 --> 22:29.342
Uh...

22:29.384 --> 22:32.265
It's Tale. Ducker.
My name...

22:33.182 --> 22:35.729
- My name is Dale.
- I'm Allison.

22:35.771 --> 22:37.941
But my...
my friends call me Allie.

22:37.983 --> 22:41.992
Well, it's a real pleasure to meet you,
Allie...son.

22:42.034 --> 22:45.205
And if you need anything else,
you just holler for me.

22:45.247 --> 22:47.209
I'll be right in the little room here.

22:49.922 --> 22:51.552
- Uh, Dale?
- Yeah.

22:52.512 --> 22:54.766
Do you guys have
anything to do around here?

22:54.850 --> 22:56.394
Do you like board games?

22:58.565 --> 23:00.443
What kind do you have?

23:01.653 --> 23:04.952
We got this one right here.
It's my favorite. Trivi-Up.

23:07.917 --> 23:09.836
- Yes!
- Come on, four out of seven.

23:09.878 --> 23:11.673
No way, dude. You lost.

23:12.466 --> 23:15.515
Just shut up and walk, bitch.

23:28.832 --> 23:30.794
Goddamn Romeo.

23:32.840 --> 23:34.884
Oh, well.

23:50.916 --> 23:52.502
Oh, Jesus.

24:10.329 --> 24:12.583
Run! Run for your lives!

25:11.279 --> 25:13.200
Here we go. Big roll. Five.

25:13.241 --> 25:15.830
One, two, three, four, five.

25:15.872 --> 25:17.584
OK, shoot.

25:19.045 --> 25:21.382
Who was the fifth President
of the United States?

25:21.424 --> 25:23.260
Oh, that's too easy. That's James Monroe.

25:24.639 --> 25:27.937
God, you are right again. You are killing me.

25:27.978 --> 25:30.191
I know. I'm sorry about that. I just...

25:30.274 --> 25:33.197
I got this weird brain
where I'm dumb as a stump,

25:33.280 --> 25:36.913
- but I remember everything I ever heard.
- That sounds pretty smart to me.

25:36.996 --> 25:41.338
No, trust me, I'm stupid.
I barely even made it past the third grade.

25:41.380 --> 25:43.466
Oh, that doesn't mean anything.

25:43.508 --> 25:47.267
There's a difference
between education and intellect.

25:50.564 --> 25:52.651
Yeah?

25:53.570 --> 25:58.413
So, um, what is it that you study in college?

25:58.454 --> 26:00.667
I'm getting my Bachelor's
degree in psychology.

26:00.709 --> 26:03.088
Oh, a Bach... Oh.

26:04.173 --> 26:07.680
So, what kind of work
would you do with that?

26:07.722 --> 26:09.767
Oh, I don't know. I, um...

26:11.229 --> 26:13.190
I-I have these stupid dreams.

26:13.274 --> 26:14.819
Dreams are not stupid.

26:16.572 --> 26:22.500
Well, um...I just think that so many of the
major problems and conflicts in the world

26:22.542 --> 26:24.838
are caused by a lack of communication,
you know?

26:24.880 --> 26:25.965
- Yeah.
- And I just...

26:26.007 --> 26:29.388
I just always thought that
I'd make a really good therapist.

26:29.430 --> 26:30.934
No, don't! Don't!

26:30.975 --> 26:35.025
Yeah, my parents say the same thing.
I should probably just give up.

26:35.067 --> 26:39.366
No. I think you could do whatever you want.
It's just, that beam is a little bit rickety.

26:39.407 --> 26:42.248
Yeah, you could have just
pushed that thing right over.

26:42.289 --> 26:43.792
Hey, hey.

26:43.833 --> 26:46.421
Oh, my God, Tucker,
what happened to your face?

26:46.463 --> 26:48.759
I sawed into a bees' nest.

26:48.842 --> 26:51.138
Why?

26:51.222 --> 26:53.895
I didn't do it on purpose, you idiot.

26:53.979 --> 26:56.942
I might have avoided it
if you were out there helping me!

26:59.906 --> 27:01.158
Yeah.

27:02.577 --> 27:04.874
We came out here to work...

27:04.916 --> 27:07.337
not sit around playing stupid board games!

27:07.379 --> 27:10.301
It was my fault, I...
I suckered him into playing.

27:10.342 --> 27:12.889
No, that's not true. It was my fault.

27:12.931 --> 27:16.606
How about I come over there
and pull those stingers out of your face?

27:16.647 --> 27:18.525
Then I'll help you with whatever you want?

27:18.567 --> 27:21.906
- All right, I'd like that. Thank you.
- OK.

27:21.948 --> 27:24.829
Let me help.
Wow, they really did a number on you.

27:24.871 --> 27:27.752
- Be careful. Be careful.
- They really got you.

27:27.793 --> 27:28.962
Hi.

27:29.046 --> 27:30.716
I saw your friend out there.

27:33.054 --> 27:37.687
He must be allergic to bees or something,
because he was runnin' like a bat outta hell.

27:37.771 --> 27:41.570
- I should go out there and find them...
- No, no! That's... No!

27:41.612 --> 27:45.285
No, you need to rest,
so we'll go find your friends.

27:45.327 --> 27:48.584
- But I can just...
- No. No buts, OK?

27:48.626 --> 27:52.006
We'll go find your friends. You should relax.
Tucker and Dale are on the case.

27:52.049 --> 27:53.551
Ain't that right, Tucker?

27:55.429 --> 27:56.765
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

27:56.808 --> 27:59.897
- Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah. Good man. OK.

28:00.941 --> 28:04.239
Dale, just...
just be careful, OK?

28:04.280 --> 28:06.535
My friends can be kind of judgmental.

28:06.576 --> 28:09.039
I'm gonna let Tucker
do most of the talking, anyway.

28:09.081 --> 28:12.170
He can win over just about anybody,
can't you? Real people person.

28:14.466 --> 28:18.224
OK, here we go.
You just relax, OK? Get some rest.

28:25.613 --> 28:29.162
- They fucking killed him, man.
- They left his body here as a message.

28:29.203 --> 28:34.422
- Yeah, "Stay the fuck out of our woods."
- I can't believe this is happening.

28:34.464 --> 28:38.847
Would you fucking quit it with this thing?
It doesn't work out here!

28:39.974 --> 28:42.520
We gotta get to the road
and try to catch a ride out of here.

28:42.562 --> 28:46.236
We don't need a ride out of here.
Don't you get it?

28:46.278 --> 28:49.618
This is what it's all about.
It's us against them.

28:49.659 --> 28:52.581
Survival of the fittest!

28:54.044 --> 28:56.882
What are you doing, man?

28:56.965 --> 28:58.259
That's my whole face.

28:58.343 --> 29:00.722
You have serious issues, you know that?

29:00.764 --> 29:04.521
- Quick. Somebody's coming.
- Oh, shit. Oh, shit...

29:04.563 --> 29:08.154
And the answer was,
"isosceles triangle". You know what that is?

29:08.196 --> 29:10.199
- Is it a triangle?
- Yeah.

29:10.241 --> 29:12.370
Tucker, you would have been proud of me.

29:12.412 --> 29:15.919
A smart little college girl like that,
and I was beating the crap out of her.

29:15.961 --> 29:17.673
- Dale.
- Yeah?

29:17.715 --> 29:20.511
You beat the crap outta everybody.
There's something wrong with your brain.

29:20.553 --> 29:22.180
I know. You keep telling me that.

29:22.222 --> 29:26.690
Tell you what, when we get back I'll finish
her off real quick then we'll get back to work.

29:26.732 --> 29:28.819
They're gonna kill her!

29:30.029 --> 29:34.078
- Somebody was just here.
- Oh, yeah. It's a hatchet.

29:35.999 --> 29:37.001
College kids!

29:38.796 --> 29:42.971
- College kids!
- Say it again. Louder.

29:43.013 --> 29:46.561
- College kids!
- Hey, college kids!

29:46.603 --> 29:49.860
College kids!

29:49.902 --> 29:51.446
I don't see 'em.

29:52.615 --> 29:54.409
They must have run off.

29:54.827 --> 29:59.921
Well... Maybe we could leave
them a note in case they come back.

29:59.962 --> 30:01.215
All right. With what?

30:02.300 --> 30:05.306
- Well, this'll work.
- All right. Please, hurry up.

30:05.348 --> 30:09.981
- My face is as hot as a hemorrhoid.
- Yeah, you don't look so good. OK.

30:10.023 --> 30:12.152
- Careful.
- I'm gonna have to etch it in.

30:36.031 --> 30:39.121
J` Uh-huh, I got my cootie shot

30:39.163 --> 30:41.417
J` You think that girl is hot...

30:41.459 --> 30:43.839
- Dale?
- Yeah? Huh...

30:44.799 --> 30:48.097
- Did you guys find my friends?
- Uh, whoa.

30:48.139 --> 30:49.850
Whoa.

30:49.892 --> 30:52.271
- What?
- Huh? What?

30:52.354 --> 30:54.943
Your friends? No, no.
Uh, we left them a note.

30:55.027 --> 30:57.156
They should be by here any minute.

30:59.953 --> 31:03.167
- What are you doing?
- Oh, I'm digging a shitter hole.

31:03.209 --> 31:05.338
I'm digging a crap... crapper hole.
It's a...

31:05.379 --> 31:08.093
It's a hole.
It's for the shithouse. Craphouse...

31:08.135 --> 31:10.807
- Outhouse hole.
- An outhouse hole.

31:11.558 --> 31:14.189
- Right. You mind if I help?
- What? No!

31:14.231 --> 31:17.822
No, no, it's not work for a pretty...
for a girl like you. That's...

31:17.863 --> 31:19.574
Oh.

31:19.616 --> 31:22.747
I grew up on a farm.
It was either help out or get out.

31:22.789 --> 31:24.166
That's a good rule.

31:24.208 --> 31:26.754
Yeah. So I've done this before,
believe it or not.

31:26.796 --> 31:27.841
Yeah.

31:34.018 --> 31:36.314
You gonna help,
or just stand there staring at me?

31:36.356 --> 31:39.905
- Uh... No, I'm gonna help. I'll just...
- I can't dig this on my own.

31:39.989 --> 31:41.449
Yeah, yeah.

31:42.995 --> 31:45.249
- Yeah, you're doing a good job.
- Thank you.

31:55.643 --> 31:58.316
That sick fuck.
He's making her dig her own grave.

31:58.357 --> 32:00.027
We don't have much time.

32:01.030 --> 32:03.618
- Does everybody have their weapons?
- All set, man.

32:03.659 --> 32:07.666
All right, you guys go around, get the guy
at the wood chipper. You take the big guy.

32:11.800 --> 32:13.846
I'm gonna just chill right here.

32:18.229 --> 32:19.941
OK, one more load and we're done.

32:20.943 --> 32:24.367
Hey, come on, get out. Here.

32:26.871 --> 32:28.374
Now!

32:29.292 --> 32:30.586
Huh?

32:32.130 --> 32:34.552
Oh, good, look, your friends are here. Hey!

32:35.763 --> 32:37.140
Dale!

32:42.484 --> 32:45.908
Oh, God!

33:24.106 --> 33:25.484
Are you OK?

33:30.035 --> 33:31.996
Allison, say something!

33:32.957 --> 33:36.380
-Tucker! Tucker!
- Holy mother of God!

33:36.463 --> 33:38.592
You'll never beli... What happened to you?

33:39.887 --> 33:42.100
- Are you OK?
- What happened to me?

33:43.102 --> 33:47.652
Some kid, he just hucked himself
right into the wood chipper!

33:47.694 --> 33:50.156
- What?
- Headfirst right into the wood chipper!

33:50.199 --> 33:53.664
From his shoes and pants, it looked like
it might have been one of the college kids.

33:53.706 --> 33:55.417
What the hell happened to her?

33:55.458 --> 33:58.548
She got knocked out and fell
in the shitter hole right next to me.

33:58.589 --> 34:00.426
Is that your blood?
What? No.

34:00.467 --> 34:03.808
No, it's college kid blood. One of them
suckers came running out of nowhere,

34:03.850 --> 34:06.229
speared himself through the gut
and died right on top of me!

34:06.271 --> 34:08.190
- Holy crap.
- I know!

34:08.233 --> 34:09.485
Calm down. Don't cry.

34:09.527 --> 34:10.571
- Calm down!
- OK.

34:10.612 --> 34:12.993
Get a hold of yourself!

34:15.371 --> 34:18.795
All right...
I know what this is.

34:18.837 --> 34:21.842
- What?
- This is a suicide pact.

34:21.925 --> 34:23.929
- It's a what?
- These kids are coming out here,

34:23.972 --> 34:27.812
- and killing themselves all over the woods.
- My God, that makes so much sense.

34:27.853 --> 34:30.485
Holy shit. We have got to hide
all of the sharp objects!

34:30.525 --> 34:33.531
You know what else?
I think they're trying to kill her, too.

34:33.572 --> 34:35.536
Yeah. Think about it.

34:35.578 --> 34:39.502
That's why they acted so funny after
we saved her, because they want her dead.

34:40.795 --> 34:44.135
- Why?
- I don't know. I don't know.

34:44.177 --> 34:47.476
It's good that you and I don't know -
if we knew they'd want to kill us, too.

34:47.518 --> 34:49.396
Yeah, that's a good point.

34:49.438 --> 34:51.984
OK, so what... what do we...

34:52.025 --> 34:54.406
We go to the police?

34:54.489 --> 34:56.201
- Call the police?
- Yeah.

34:57.286 --> 35:00.041
- And tell 'em what?
- Uh...we'll tell 'em what happened.

35:00.083 --> 35:02.337
That's a good idea, Dale.

35:02.421 --> 35:06.637
"Oh, hidey-ho, Officer.
We've had a doozy of a day.

35:06.679 --> 35:10.019
"There we were, minding our own business,
doing some chores around the house,

35:10.061 --> 35:12.399
"when kids started killing themselves
all over my property."

35:12.441 --> 35:14.193
Well, that's what happened, Tucker!

35:14.235 --> 35:17.408
You would have to be a moron
to believe that, Dale.

35:17.450 --> 35:21.667
It doesn't matter what happened. What
matters is what looks like what happened.

35:21.709 --> 35:25.841
And what looks like what happened...
is pretty nasty.

35:25.883 --> 35:27.678
So what the hell do we do?

35:29.014 --> 35:30.976
We gotta clean this mess up.

35:31.811 --> 35:34.274
- Right now.
- OK.

35:37.822 --> 35:40.286
You shouldn’t be smoking anyway, Chloe.

35:40.369 --> 35:41.371
It's not good for you.

35:41.455 --> 35:43.417
Fucking dying isn't good for you, either,

35:43.459 --> 35:46.339
but that doesn't
seem to be stopping anybody!

35:46.380 --> 35:50.012
We gotta get out of here. I mean,
what the hell are we still doing here?

35:50.055 --> 35:51.850
How are we gonna get outta here?

35:51.892 --> 35:54.355
Dickwad over here sent Chuck off
with the truck!

35:54.396 --> 35:55.857
Well, then let's walk.

35:55.899 --> 35:58.112
- 40 miles?
- You should have thought of that

35:58.153 --> 36:01.034
- before you wore your stripper shoes.
- Will y'all just shut up?

36:01.076 --> 36:03.414
Listen, we gotta work together, OK?

36:03.456 --> 36:06.211
We never should’ve come out here.
Whose stupid idea was this?

36:06.253 --> 36:07.296
Chad!

36:10.928 --> 36:14.352
You guys are all a bunch of fucking pussies,
you know that?

36:14.394 --> 36:18.317
I mean, a few little tiny murders...

36:18.401 --> 36:20.572
and everyone just freaks out.

36:21.782 --> 36:24.037
But do you know how lucky you all are, huh?

36:24.079 --> 36:28.086
- Huh?
- What the fuck are you talking about, man?

36:28.129 --> 36:32.136
How many people do you think
get a chance for something like this?

36:33.096 --> 36:36.479
- The chance to die?
- The chance to live.

36:36.520 --> 36:41.028
To be free from people always
telling you what you can and can't do.

36:41.069 --> 36:44.576
There's no rules out here.
It's us against them.

36:45.495 --> 36:48.960
And if you don't think
you can handle that, well...

36:50.756 --> 36:52.217
maybe you deserve to die.

36:55.640 --> 36:57.352
That's fucked up.

36:58.771 --> 37:02.236
Y'all hear that?

37:02.319 --> 37:04.991
Chuck got the police!
Come on, you guys, let's go!

37:05.033 --> 37:07.621
No, you don't need the fucking cops!

37:07.663 --> 37:09.918
The cops aren't gonna help us, man.

37:12.339 --> 37:14.969
Don't you fucking idiots know anything?

37:16.054 --> 37:17.098
Fuck.

37:21.899 --> 37:25.698
Now, don't you worry.
Your friends are probably fine.

37:25.739 --> 37:28.244
Probably just a little misunderstanding,
that's all.

37:28.286 --> 37:29.999
- Oh, God! Look out!

37:30.040 --> 37:32.252
- Help us! Help us!
- Chloe?

37:32.294 --> 37:33.547
They're dead!

37:33.589 --> 37:35.008
They died!

37:35.049 --> 37:36.844
Slow down, now.

37:36.927 --> 37:39.140
- They killed them!
- OK.

37:39.182 --> 37:45.068
Stay calm. Well, why don't you kids climb in
the back seat, and we'll go have a look?

37:48.575 --> 37:50.871
Those stupid fucks.

37:56.090 --> 38:00.306
I don't think I have the stomach for this, Tuck.

38:00.348 --> 38:03.605
I know.
He's jammed in there pretty good.

38:05.651 --> 38:08.614
- The store better not charge me for this!
- Yup.

38:08.656 --> 38:12.412
All right, look, I'm gonna wedge it from
that side, and you pull him out on three.

38:12.454 --> 38:13.623
- OK.
- All right?

38:14.584 --> 38:17.757
One. Two. Three!

38:17.799 --> 38:19.176
Argh!

38:19.260 --> 38:23.183
- Oh, Tuck! Oh, take it off! Take it off me!
- OK, help me get it off.

38:23.267 --> 38:26.440
Get it off me. Not on the face!

38:27.943 --> 38:29.320
Oh! I'm gonna barf.

38:30.615 --> 38:32.577
You're OK, you're OK.

38:32.618 --> 38:35.416
- Here, grab a leg. Grab a leg.
- OK.

38:35.457 --> 38:36.669
Get him over to the truck.

38:38.839 --> 38:41.428
Oh, God. Oh, God.

38:41.469 --> 38:43.682
- He's heavy for half a guy.
- Oh, God.

38:50.236 --> 38:52.157
Oh, shit.

38:57.333 --> 38:59.296
- Let me do the talking.
- That's a good idea.

39:01.592 --> 39:03.053
You kids stay put.

39:05.390 --> 39:07.060
I'll handle this.

39:08.520 --> 39:11.027
- Hey.
- Hello, Officer.

39:11.069 --> 39:13.072
- Good to see you again.
- Yeah.

39:15.493 --> 39:18.791
- We have had a doozy of a day.
- A real doozy.

39:18.832 --> 39:22.340
- Uh, there we were...
- Yup.

39:22.382 --> 39:24.636
- Minding our own business...
- Yup.

39:24.678 --> 39:27.684
- Making improvements to my house...
- The new house.

39:27.725 --> 39:29.937
..when, all of a sudden,
out of nowhere,

39:29.979 --> 39:34.781
these kids started killing themselves
all over my property.

39:34.823 --> 39:38.328
This one right here, he dove headfirst
right into the wood chipper,

39:38.413 --> 39:39.665
the woody right back there.

39:39.707 --> 39:44.800
There's another one up over there
who shoved a spear through his gullet.

39:44.883 --> 39:46.052
Straight through.

39:46.094 --> 39:48.974
I don't know how much experience
you've had with this,

39:49.016 --> 39:52.480
- but we were scared shitless.
- Scared shitless.

40:00.621 --> 40:05.465
You must think that I'm some
kind of moron to believe a story like that.

40:05.506 --> 40:07.135
- No...
-Oh, no.

40:07.177 --> 40:10.516
- No, sir.
- Not a moron, just...open-minded.

40:10.558 --> 40:14.941
Let me get this straight, cos I'm having
trouble understanding something.

40:16.570 --> 40:19.367
- What?
- You say you were just working,

40:19.408 --> 40:25.586
when this...kid...ran up
and stuffed his head into that wood chipper?

40:25.628 --> 40:27.675
- That's a fact.
- That is a fact.

40:27.716 --> 40:33.560
And I think maybe they might be
trying to kill the girl that we have inside.

40:33.602 --> 40:35.063
- What girl?
- You know what?

40:35.105 --> 40:38.529
She can maybe explain
the whole thing if, uh...

40:38.570 --> 40:41.493
if I hadn't have knocked her
unconscious with a shovel.

40:41.535 --> 40:43.997
- That's...
- On accident.

40:44.039 --> 40:45.125
On accident.

40:45.166 --> 40:49.466
You've got another one inside,
and you say she's unconscious?

40:49.508 --> 40:52.597
- Yeah, she's in my bedroom.
- That's...

40:57.022 --> 40:58.735
You better show me what you done with her.

40:58.776 --> 41:01.949
- Right this way. Let's show him.
- OK, I'm gonna put this leg down.

41:01.991 --> 41:04.579
Great idea. Why don't you go and show him?

41:05.664 --> 41:07.125
Wait, where is he going?

41:08.169 --> 41:10.883
- No, don't go in there.
- Right this way, Sheriff.

41:15.308 --> 41:17.019
What's he doing?

41:17.854 --> 41:19.608
Why doesn't he fucking arrest them?

41:26.914 --> 41:29.794
Her eyes are equal, reactive to light.

41:32.132 --> 41:34.637
- At least she's not brain-dead.
- Oh, thank God.

41:34.678 --> 41:39.062
I told you boys to stay away from this place,
but you just didn't listen, did you?

41:39.104 --> 41:42.485
Now, you're looking at least two counts
of involuntary manslaughter,

41:42.569 --> 41:44.615
but you'd be lucky to get that.

41:44.698 --> 41:48.872
Officer, do we look like
a couple of psycho killers to you?

41:50.960 --> 41:53.925
Well, it's... it's hard to say.

41:54.676 --> 41:56.680
Looks can be deceiving.

41:56.721 --> 41:58.099
Oh, don't!

42:01.355 --> 42:03.693
Sheriff! You OK?

42:06.282 --> 42:07.742
Oh, shit!

42:07.784 --> 42:10.456
- Come on!
- What is going on?

42:10.497 --> 42:13.795
- How's he even walking, Tuck?
- He looks like he's gonna walk it off.

42:13.837 --> 42:15.382
He's gonna be fine.

42:21.352 --> 42:23.063
Don't worry, I got it.

42:25.526 --> 42:27.615
It's Sher... Sher...

42:29.284 --> 42:31.330
Oh, my God! They fucking killed him!

42:31.371 --> 42:33.334
Unlock the door!

42:34.544 --> 42:38.260
God damn it, Tucker!
I told you we should have fixed that beam!

42:38.302 --> 42:42.142
You are not putting this on me!
Do you understand me? This is your fault.

42:42.184 --> 42:45.690
In there playing board games
with that little girl when I'm out working!

42:53.414 --> 42:55.376
Unlock the fucking door!

42:55.417 --> 42:59.258
If you hadn't been playing
board games with that little girl inside,

42:59.342 --> 43:02.265
we would have had
a little more time to fix the beam!

43:02.348 --> 43:03.433
Heads up.

43:03.517 --> 43:05.646
- Fuck you, you motherfuckers!
- No, no, no!

43:07.942 --> 43:10.238
Oh, you got to take
the safety off on the side there.

43:12.910 --> 43:14.079
Don't do...

43:14.121 --> 43:16.584
Jesus! Oh, God!

43:18.128 --> 43:20.674
You've got to start being more careful!

43:27.021 --> 43:29.400
I don't think he understands!

43:32.030 --> 43:33.993
"You gotta take the safety off"?

43:34.869 --> 43:39.586
You're something, Dale. None of this
would have happened if it wasn't for you!

43:39.628 --> 43:41.048
- What?
- That's right!

43:41.089 --> 43:44.513
For being such a goddamn Good Samaritan!
"My God, she's drowning, Tucker.

43:44.597 --> 43:49.272
- "Oh, let's save her." Hell!
- Well, at least she's still alive.

43:49.314 --> 43:52.402
- Oh, halle-fuckin'-lujah!
- Don't you dare blame this on her!

43:52.444 --> 43:55.785
I'm not blaming this on her,
I'm blaming this on you!

43:55.826 --> 43:57.371
Well, you know what, Tucker?

43:57.412 --> 44:01.462
None of this would have happened
if we hadn't have gone fishin'!

44:01.504 --> 44:04.259
- That isn't even an option.
- I don't even like fishin'!

44:04.300 --> 44:05.804
You don't like...

44:08.016 --> 44:11.481
- What do you mean, you don't like fishin'?
- I-I mean...

44:11.523 --> 44:13.694
I like... I like it OK.

44:13.735 --> 44:16.031
You know... I'm sorry.

44:16.073 --> 44:19.914
I'm sorry, Tucker.
Did I hurt your feelings? I'm sorry.

44:21.543 --> 44:23.671
- Yeah, you kinda did.

44:24.756 --> 44:26.135
- Cut it out!

44:29.641 --> 44:30.936
Tucker...

44:32.147 --> 44:33.649
where's Jangers?

44:37.031 --> 44:38.659
- Shit.
- Stay here.

44:39.703 --> 44:40.830
Aah! Damn.

44:42.166 --> 44:43.793
Nuts...

44:45.422 --> 44:48.010
- Hey, hillbilly! Your move.

44:48.052 --> 44:49.680
Oh, son of a bitch!

44:49.722 --> 44:52.185
- They got my dog.
- Shit!

44:52.226 --> 44:54.439
We gotta do something.

44:54.481 --> 44:58.071
- Did you bring that nail gun in here?
- Yeah. Why?

44:59.616 --> 45:01.829
Stay low. Stay low to the ground.
Keep your hat!

45:09.927 --> 45:11.723
All right.

45:12.725 --> 45:14.896
- Cover me.
- Uh...

45:14.938 --> 45:17.066
I ain't never shot at nobody before.

45:18.026 --> 45:22.034
If it helps,
think of 'em like moving two-by-fours.

45:24.832 --> 45:28.088
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

45:28.130 --> 45:30.216
Now, you create a distraction.

45:31.594 --> 45:33.598
I'm gonna go out the back door.

45:33.640 --> 45:35.978
- And, Dale...
- Yeah.

45:36.020 --> 45:37.188
Try not to shoot me.

45:38.566 --> 45:40.194
- OK, I'll try.
- All right.

45:40.236 --> 45:44.035
- What the fuck is taking so long?
- I don't know.

45:46.623 --> 45:49.170
Hey, college kids! You want some of this?

46:10.628 --> 46:14.009
Ha-ha! You like that, college kids?
How's that taste?

46:14.051 --> 46:17.809
I got plenty more where that came from!
Bunch of freaks!

46:22.567 --> 46:23.946
Shit!

46:32.337 --> 46:35.885
Jesus, Dale. Take it easy.

46:35.927 --> 46:37.013
Hey, hillbilly!

46:38.181 --> 46:41.772
You shoot at us again, and your dog's dead!

46:42.648 --> 46:46.573
If you kill my dog,
I swear to God, I'll get really mad!

46:46.614 --> 46:47.908
Then bring out the girl!

46:52.167 --> 46:54.839
I'm gonna shoot your dog!

46:54.881 --> 46:56.425
I'm gonna get really mad!

46:56.467 --> 46:58.011
I'll get really mad!

46:59.180 --> 47:03.230
Go home. Go!
No, you're going the wrong way, shithead!

47:09.867 --> 47:12.206
It is a beautiful day for a run, isn't it?

48:14.033 --> 48:15.787
Oh, God. Please, no.

48:24.470 --> 48:25.764
Are we done yet?

48:25.847 --> 48:29.230
I don't know, Naomi, is it covered?
We may only get one chance at this.

48:29.313 --> 48:31.818
All right...trap's set.

48:33.530 --> 48:36.368
Hey...he's awake.

48:40.042 --> 48:42.380
What the hell is wrong with you kids?

48:42.421 --> 48:45.009
What is the matter with us?

48:45.051 --> 48:46.220
- Hold him steady.
- Yeah.

48:46.262 --> 48:48.266
Wait. Stop...

48:51.523 --> 48:53.861
I've never stood so close to pure evil before.

48:59.453 --> 49:03.754
- It kind of stinks.
- It was supposed to be 24-hour protection...

49:03.838 --> 49:05.382
OK! Don't...

49:05.465 --> 49:10.183
No, look, I know you kids are having fun,
but I am not a thrill-seeker!

49:10.266 --> 49:13.023
It's payback time, hillbilly.

49:13.815 --> 49:18.532
Payback... All right, look.
Just let me go... Just let me go.

49:18.574 --> 49:20.453
I can get my cooler.

49:21.246 --> 49:24.085
Hey, I got 10 to 12 beers in there.

49:24.127 --> 49:27.759
They're yours.
They're on ice right now, man!

49:28.802 --> 49:31.015
- This is for Mike!
- No!

49:34.688 --> 49:37.569
You prick.

49:44.792 --> 49:46.254
- Dale?
- Allison.

49:47.046 --> 49:48.925
How are you feelin'?

49:50.762 --> 49:53.350
- A little fuzzy.
- Yeah.

49:55.353 --> 49:56.564
Wha...

49:57.733 --> 49:59.070
What happ...

49:59.112 --> 50:00.906
- What happened?
- Oh...

50:02.827 --> 50:03.996
Well, uh...

50:05.456 --> 50:07.711
I can't... I can't really say.

50:07.752 --> 50:08.839
Um...

50:11.051 --> 50:12.512
It was so awful.

50:14.516 --> 50:16.979
Oh, my God. I'm embarrassed. I'm sorry.

50:17.021 --> 50:19.776
- I can't cry in front of a girl, God damn it.
- That's OK.

50:19.818 --> 50:22.114
It's good to cry sometimes.

50:22.156 --> 50:24.201
It's OK, just...

50:24.243 --> 50:25.954
Just let it out. It's OK, all right?

50:29.252 --> 50:31.925
There you go. It'll feel better.

50:35.974 --> 50:37.393
Come on, just take a deep breath.

50:42.195 --> 50:44.491
There we go. Now...

50:45.826 --> 50:47.287
Now tell me what happened.

50:48.915 --> 50:51.964
Well...it's hard to say.

50:52.005 --> 50:53.216
Um...

50:55.262 --> 50:56.514
Your friends...

50:57.683 --> 51:00.354
Do some of your friends take medication?

51:01.189 --> 51:03.945
- Why?
- Because I think they forgot to take it.

51:05.949 --> 51:08.870
What are you talking about?
What... Where are they?

51:08.954 --> 51:12.920
They're out there somewhere right now
tryin' to kill my best friend...and my dog.

51:12.962 --> 51:15.509
- I don't understand what you're talking...
- I know.

51:15.551 --> 51:18.097
It doesn't make any sense.
That's what the truth is.

51:18.139 --> 51:21.395
It's like all your friends just
decided to go nuts all at the same time.

51:21.437 --> 51:25.778
The last thing I remember, I saw...
I saw Chad and...

51:25.820 --> 51:30.412
and then Todd was running at us, and...

51:32.249 --> 51:34.503
- Oh, my God.
- I know.

51:34.545 --> 51:36.842
At first I thought they were trying to kill you,

51:36.884 --> 51:42.101
and then they started killing themselves
and then they tried to kill us,

51:42.143 --> 51:44.356
and now they're going after my dog...

51:44.439 --> 51:45.900
..Jangers.

51:45.983 --> 51:48.113
I guess they just like killing.

51:48.155 --> 51:51.578
No, there must be some kind of mistake.
My friends would never hurt anyone.

51:51.662 --> 51:53.374
Jesus, they're here!

51:53.415 --> 51:56.629
They're not gonna stop till they kill all of us,
I'm telling you. Hide!

51:56.671 --> 51:59.260
Dale, it's OK. Nobody wants to hurt you.

51:59.302 --> 52:01.807
- Die, hillbilly!
- It sure sounds like someone does.

52:01.848 --> 52:04.269
I'm gonna go talk to them, OK?
Just stay there.

52:04.311 --> 52:07.441
- What? No, no.
- It's all just a big misunderstanding.

52:07.484 --> 52:09.405
We’ll clear it right up, OK?

52:09.446 --> 52:12.494
Allison, don't go out there!
You don't know what it's like out there.

52:17.044 --> 52:18.087
Oh, my God.

52:25.059 --> 52:26.855
Allison!

52:47.394 --> 52:49.231
Did you see them?

52:51.318 --> 52:53.656
- No.
- No?

52:57.581 --> 52:59.626
That's from Tucker's shirt.

53:01.755 --> 53:03.802
What is that?

53:03.843 --> 53:05.262
Oh, my God!

53:05.304 --> 53:08.059
Oh, my God!
They cut off his bowlin' fingers!

53:10.481 --> 53:12.150
There's a note right there.

53:24.257 --> 53:28.223
"Now we got your friend. Try and get him!"

53:30.185 --> 53:33.400
Dale, how...
how long was I out for?

53:34.109 --> 53:35.529
A few hours.

53:35.571 --> 53:37.283
I don't understand what...

53:37.324 --> 53:38.827
I gotta go help Tucker.

53:38.869 --> 53:40.289
God damn it.

53:41.666 --> 53:43.962
My best friend needs me.
I'm gonna get these kids.

53:44.045 --> 53:48.179
- Wait. We don't want to escalate things.
- We don't want to escalate things?

53:48.220 --> 53:50.892
No. They must have thought
you were trying to harm me.

53:50.934 --> 53:52.937
Oh, and why would they think that?

53:55.233 --> 53:57.321
I... I don't know.

53:58.114 --> 53:59.493
I think you do know.

53:59.534 --> 54:04.084
Well, when we first saw you guys
back at that store...

54:06.046 --> 54:08.634
we just thought that you looked...

54:08.675 --> 54:10.597
a little creepy.

54:10.639 --> 54:13.812
I was nervous.
I don't know how to talk to girls, and I...

54:13.853 --> 54:15.815
Dale, I know that now, but we didn't then.

54:15.856 --> 54:18.069
You thought I looked
like some kind of freak.

54:18.904 --> 54:20.909
We misjudged you, Dale. I...

54:23.080 --> 54:24.541
I'm really sorry.

54:24.582 --> 54:26.377
Don't be sorry. It's my fault.

54:27.420 --> 54:31.261
I should have known that if
a guy like me talked to a girl like you,

54:31.345 --> 54:32.932
somebody'd end up dead.

54:33.892 --> 54:36.230
Dale, it's... Dale, it's not like that.

54:36.272 --> 54:38.776
If you do see your friends...

54:38.818 --> 54:41.656
tell 'em that I never wanted to hurt anybody.

54:42.826 --> 54:45.372
Dale, Dale, stop. Wait. No...

54:45.414 --> 54:46.624
Don't go there.

54:50.256 --> 54:52.177
Oh, shit.

54:52.218 --> 54:53.638
Tucker!

54:56.101 --> 54:58.355
- Tucker, you cut there?

55:05.703 --> 55:06.705
Tuck!

55:27.913 --> 55:30.084
Oh, goddamn stupid college kids.

55:34.968 --> 55:36.178
Tucker!

55:36.220 --> 55:38.851
- Dale!
- I'm comin' for you, buddy!

55:40.312 --> 55:41.731
Tucker?!

55:41.773 --> 55:43.734
Yeah.

55:43.776 --> 55:45.405
Tuck! Tucker!

55:46.949 --> 55:48.745
- Dale...
- Hey!

55:49.746 --> 55:51.208
- Tucker.
- Dale, it's a trap.

55:51.917 --> 55:53.796
- It's a what?
- It's a trap.

55:53.880 --> 55:55.215
What?

55:56.259 --> 55:57.678
Oh, no. Oh, no! Tuck, no!

55:57.720 --> 55:59.180
I don't wanna die! Please!

56:00.058 --> 56:03.106
Oh, God! Tucker!

56:03.148 --> 56:04.567
Dale...

56:11.456 --> 56:12.791
I never thought I'd say this,

56:12.833 --> 56:14.628
but I'm glad I'm not hung like a bear.

56:14.669 --> 56:17.842
That's funny.

56:21.558 --> 56:23.187
Dale...

56:23.229 --> 56:26.818
that kid, he's got some serious issues.

56:26.902 --> 56:29.198
I know. Let's get you down from there.

56:29.281 --> 56:31.326
Wait!

56:31.368 --> 56:32.747
Sorry about that.

56:32.830 --> 56:34.500
This vacation sucks.

56:36.044 --> 56:37.714
Come on, let's go.

56:56.835 --> 56:58.671
Look at this place.

56:59.715 --> 57:04.140
- This is where evil lives.
- Let's just hope that Allison's still alive.

57:06.604 --> 57:07.856
Allison!

57:07.897 --> 57:09.442
- Allison!
- Chad?

57:10.695 --> 57:12.323
- Chad?
- Shh!

57:12.364 --> 57:13.575
What are you guys doing?

57:13.658 --> 57:15.495
Saving you, stupid!
Come on. Let's go.

57:15.537 --> 57:18.752
Why are you whispering?
There's no one else here.

57:24.596 --> 57:26.516
This place is really freaky.

57:26.558 --> 57:29.230
What have they done to you, Allie?
Huh?

57:29.272 --> 57:31.443
They haven't done anything to me.

57:31.485 --> 57:33.739
Chad, this has all been
a huge misunderstanding.

57:33.781 --> 57:37.829
We have to burn this place to the ground.
Destroy it completely.

57:37.871 --> 57:40.293
What? No, no. Chad...

57:40.920 --> 57:42.381
Chad! Stop.

57:43.299 --> 57:45.220
No, Chad, no. Chad, stop!

57:46.764 --> 57:50.355
You can't do this.
This is their vacation home.

57:50.397 --> 57:52.274
You guys have to listen to me, OK?

57:52.317 --> 57:56.908
Tucker and Dale did not mean
to hurt anyone. They're really nice.

57:56.950 --> 57:58.954
You have no idea...

57:58.996 --> 58:02.336
what this is all about, do you, Allison?

58:02.378 --> 58:04.173
- Huh?
- No.

58:05.843 --> 58:08.681
These freaks are evil...

58:09.558 --> 58:12.523
and they deserve everything
that's coming to them.

58:12.565 --> 58:14.735
OK, just relax, all right?

58:14.776 --> 58:18.241
I'm just trying to explain
this is all a big misunderstanding.

58:18.283 --> 58:21.247
Tucker and Dale have been nothing
but gentlemen to me this entire time,

58:21.289 --> 58:24.546
- while you guys have been terrorizing them.
- But they started this!

58:24.588 --> 58:27.676
By doing what? Saving my life?

58:28.762 --> 58:32.602
Wait a minute. I remember reading
about this in my sociology class.

58:32.685 --> 58:34.315
It's called Stockholm syndrome.

58:34.357 --> 58:37.278
When someone who's been kidnapped
falls in love with their kidnapper.

58:40.242 --> 58:41.661
You're falling in love with him?

58:41.703 --> 58:44.041
No. W-What?

58:44.083 --> 58:47.924
- Chad, the... The what? This is...
- Tell me...

58:47.965 --> 58:52.724
you're not falling in love
with that freak, Allison.

58:54.144 --> 58:55.981
How could you love him?

58:57.651 --> 58:59.988
Chad, please. You don't understand.

59:00.030 --> 59:02.869
Well, are you or are you not
in love with him?

59:02.911 --> 59:04.706
- What is the matter with you?
- Tell me!

59:05.749 --> 59:09.257
Hey! Let the girl go.

59:12.096 --> 59:15.936
- Are you OK, Allie?
- Allie? Did he just call you Allie?

59:16.019 --> 59:20.153
Wait. Everyone just stop for a second
and let's talk this out, OK?

59:20.194 --> 59:22.574
Nobody wants to hurt anyone.

59:22.615 --> 59:24.786
You could have fooled me.

59:24.828 --> 59:27.374
- Fuck off, hillbilly.
- Eat shit, body perm.

59:27.417 --> 59:30.381
Wait! How about I make some tea,

59:30.423 --> 59:33.303
and we all sit and talk this out?

59:33.344 --> 59:37.895
Oh, yeah, that sounds like a good idea.
I'll provide the finger sandwiches.

59:39.022 --> 59:40.651
I'm gonna go get a beer.

59:40.693 --> 59:44.408
OK, Chad, you...sit here, OK?

59:44.450 --> 59:46.662
In this chair.

59:46.746 --> 59:48.332
Dale, you...

59:49.292 --> 59:51.088
you sit in this one.

59:58.602 --> 01:00:01.108
OK, good. Now, um...

01:00:01.984 --> 01:00:03.529
I'm gonna get the tea.

01:00:06.868 --> 01:00:10.291
Is that chamomile tea? I can't have that.
It fucks with my asthma.

01:00:10.333 --> 01:00:11.961
It's Earl Grey.

01:00:12.002 --> 01:00:14.133
Oh, I love Earl Grey. That's great.

01:00:16.637 --> 01:00:21.229
Here's what we're gonna do.
I want you each to tell your side of the story,

01:00:21.271 --> 01:00:27.783
and as you're listening to the other person,
I want you to see yourself in their shoes.

01:00:27.825 --> 01:00:28.910
OK?

01:00:31.457 --> 01:00:32.584
OK.

01:00:32.667 --> 01:00:35.131
Now, it's important
that we communicate our feelings

01:00:35.215 --> 01:00:39.097
and understand each other's perspective
before any progress can be made.

01:00:42.102 --> 01:00:43.146
OK.

01:00:43.522 --> 01:00:45.067
Chad, why don't you start?

01:00:46.653 --> 01:00:50.494
- Well, where should I fucking begin?
- Wherever you'd like.

01:00:51.412 --> 01:00:53.291
A long time ago,

01:00:53.333 --> 01:00:56.590
- before I was born...
- OK, maybe not that far back.

01:00:56.632 --> 01:00:58.343
This is important.

01:01:01.306 --> 01:01:05.189
You see, my parents, they were attacked
by hillbillies just like him.

01:01:07.528 --> 01:01:09.907
It was 20 years ago.

01:01:09.949 --> 01:01:11.743
The Memorial Day Massacre.

01:01:13.747 --> 01:01:17.212
They brutally murdered everyone.
Just for fun.

01:01:17.838 --> 01:01:20.845
My mother ran for her life.

01:01:20.886 --> 01:01:22.347
But they captured hen

01:01:31.282 --> 01:01:33.326
My father was helpless...

01:01:33.368 --> 01:01:37.042
and he didn't even know
that she was pregnant with me yet.

01:01:39.505 --> 01:01:41.342
And they forced him to watch...

01:01:42.595 --> 01:01:44.640
while they tortured hen

01:01:48.105 --> 01:01:50.776
But my mom, she fought back...

01:01:51.905 --> 01:01:53.867
- ..and she escaped.

01:01:55.036 --> 01:01:57.373
But my father wasn’t so lucky.

01:02:02.258 --> 01:02:04.596
His body was never found.

01:02:11.943 --> 01:02:14.156
By the time I was born...

01:02:14.198 --> 01:02:16.994
my mother was already institutionalized.

01:02:17.955 --> 01:02:21.294
I grew up hearing that story
from my grandmother.

01:02:28.141 --> 01:02:30.521
OK. Um...

01:02:32.482 --> 01:02:34.862
Thank you for sharing with us, Chad.

01:02:49.098 --> 01:02:52.021
- No, I'm not going in there!
- Hey, hey, hey.

01:02:52.062 --> 01:02:55.694
Now, Chad said if they were
gone longer than 15 minutes,

01:02:55.736 --> 01:02:57.531
we come in, guns blazing.

01:02:57.573 --> 01:03:02.415
- But you don't even have a gun.
- Damn it, woman! Don't argue with me!

01:03:12.185 --> 01:03:17.819
Are they drinking tea? Oh!
I would totally love a cup of tea right now.

01:03:18.989 --> 01:03:20.283
No!

01:03:20.325 --> 01:03:21.619
No way.

01:03:21.662 --> 01:03:23.831
They're fucking trapped.

01:03:23.873 --> 01:03:26.294
Oh...yeah.

01:03:26.336 --> 01:03:29.342
Now, come on, we gotta do something.

01:03:32.808 --> 01:03:33.893
It's your turn.

01:03:35.104 --> 01:03:37.525
OK, well...

01:03:38.777 --> 01:03:40.154
First of all...

01:03:41.951 --> 01:03:45.791
I am really sorry
that your family got massacred.

01:03:46.876 --> 01:03:48.129
That is awful.

01:03:48.254 --> 01:03:52.638
Secondly...
I didn't have anything to do with that, OK?

01:03:52.680 --> 01:03:56.645
I mean, I would have been six years old
at the time, so...

01:03:56.729 --> 01:03:59.985
It may not have been you,
but it was definitely your kind.

01:04:00.027 --> 01:04:04.619
My kind? Now, hey, I can't even hurt a fish,
can I, Tucker? I can't even hurt fish.

01:04:04.661 --> 01:04:08.000
That's right.
He can't even hurt a fish.

01:04:08.043 --> 01:04:09.920
I just can't do it!

01:04:09.962 --> 01:04:14.138
OK. S-So now that you've both
expressed your side of the story,

01:04:14.180 --> 01:04:16.559
how do you feel?

01:04:16.601 --> 01:04:19.397
I feel better. I feel...

01:04:19.439 --> 01:04:21.610
I feel like a weight... Yeah, I feel good.

01:04:22.612 --> 01:04:26.161
Great. OK.
We're really making good progress.

01:04:27.830 --> 01:04:30.210
It's show time, freaks!

01:04:30.878 --> 01:04:33.091
Jason! No!

01:04:35.512 --> 01:04:36.555
Jesus Christ!

01:04:40.020 --> 01:04:42.943
Oh, shit, baby! Why didn't you duck?
Why didn't she duck?

01:04:44.153 --> 01:04:45.656
Chad, st...

01:04:46.324 --> 01:04:47.661
- Get him, Tucker!

01:04:49.622 --> 01:04:50.666
Dale!

01:04:53.380 --> 01:04:55.383
Go back to hell where you belong, freak!

01:04:55.968 --> 01:04:57.888
Oh, shit!

01:04:57.930 --> 01:05:00.184
Shit! Chad, what the fuck?

01:05:00.226 --> 01:05:01.813
- Be calm. It's just the leg.
- Stop and roll.

01:05:01.855 --> 01:05:03.649
- I'm on fire!
- No, don't use that.

01:05:09.578 --> 01:05:10.830
Stop, drop, and roll!

01:05:12.375 --> 01:05:14.253
- Get away from him!
- Stomp it out!

01:05:20.432 --> 01:05:22.728
He's crackling like a log!

01:05:22.770 --> 01:05:24.064
Oh, that stinks.

01:05:26.903 --> 01:05:29.115
- Oh, shit!
- I knew I shoulda moved that.

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:35.669
- Allie, run!
- Run!

01:05:35.711 --> 01:05:36.755
Come on, let's go!

01:05:37.965 --> 01:05:39.969
Help me!

01:05:40.011 --> 01:05:42.058
Get off of me, you nasty bitch!

01:05:52.409 --> 01:05:53.872
My cabin.

01:05:54.832 --> 01:05:56.377
Your cabin.

01:05:57.420 --> 01:05:58.965
I'm a terrible therapist.

01:05:59.048 --> 01:06:02.137
What? No, that's not true.
Don't say that.

01:06:02.179 --> 01:06:04.560
I thought you did a great job in there.

01:06:04.601 --> 01:06:06.729
- Really?
- Yeah, really.

01:06:07.982 --> 01:06:10.779
I think we were on the verge of a breakthrough.

01:06:12.198 --> 01:06:13.909
Thanks, Dale. That's really sweet.

01:06:13.951 --> 01:06:16.123
- Uh, guys?
- Yeah.

01:06:20.047 --> 01:06:22.342
I think we should go
to the pickup truck right now.

01:06:22.385 --> 01:06:24.180
Wait. Maybe we should help him.

01:06:27.520 --> 01:06:29.524
- Argh!
- Never mind. Let's just go.

01:06:29.566 --> 01:06:31.444
Get to the truck!

01:06:31.486 --> 01:06:33.781
Tucker! Tucker!

01:06:35.535 --> 01:06:37.247
He's coming!

01:06:37.581 --> 01:06:41.839
- OK, come on, truck. Come on, truck.
- Come on, Dale. Go, go!

01:06:41.881 --> 01:06:44.469
- Do not flood it.
- Do you wanna drive?!

01:06:44.511 --> 01:06:46.473
- Guys, just go!
- Be careful with this.

01:06:46.515 --> 01:06:48.645
This is the only thing I got left.

01:06:50.397 --> 01:06:51.441
Go.

01:06:56.116 --> 01:06:59.916
Crazy college kid can't catch us now!

01:06:59.958 --> 01:07:01.502
- Dale, look out!
- Huh?

01:07:16.781 --> 01:07:18.910
Jangers, not now, boy.

01:07:18.994 --> 01:07:21.959
Jangers, hey!

01:07:23.795 --> 01:07:25.549
Whoa. Jangers!

01:07:27.093 --> 01:07:28.262
Allie.

01:07:29.139 --> 01:07:30.683
Allison!

01:07:31.936 --> 01:07:33.857
Jangers... Allison!

01:07:34.816 --> 01:07:36.068
She's gone.

01:07:36.111 --> 01:07:38.782
What the hell... Tucker?

01:07:41.621 --> 01:07:45.337
Tucker, what happened?
Tucker, what hap...

01:07:46.547 --> 01:07:48.509
He took her.

01:07:48.551 --> 01:07:50.430
I tried to stop him.

01:07:50.472 --> 01:07:53.979
Whoa, take it easy.

01:07:54.021 --> 01:07:55.315
I tell you something, Dale.

01:07:55.398 --> 01:07:57.945
It's gonna be a long time
before I take a vacation again.

01:07:58.028 --> 01:08:01.910
Oh, shit. Tucker, this is all my fault.

01:08:03.329 --> 01:08:04.750
- Look at you.
- Nah.

01:08:04.792 --> 01:08:08.549
I never should have talked to Allison.
You were right.

01:08:08.590 --> 01:08:10.719
People like me and people like her
just don't mix.

01:08:10.761 --> 01:08:12.931
- That's not true.
- It is true!

01:08:12.974 --> 01:08:15.729
I never should have even
came out here with you.

01:08:15.771 --> 01:08:17.942
Listen to me.

01:08:20.697 --> 01:08:22.908
Do you remember when we was kids...

01:08:24.078 --> 01:08:26.375
and we used to go catch frogs
down at that creek?

01:08:26.417 --> 01:08:28.420
Yeah. Yeah, I guess I do.

01:08:29.673 --> 01:08:33.846
Remember how we used to compete
to see who could catch more?

01:08:33.888 --> 01:08:37.228
Yeah, but I don't think now's
the time to talk about it, Tucker.

01:08:37.270 --> 01:08:42.029
And I used to tell you that I let you catch
more than me because I felt sorry for you.

01:08:42.071 --> 01:08:44.993
I remember you used
to let me lick 'em all, too.

01:08:45.035 --> 01:08:47.163
That always made me feel kinda funny.

01:08:47.205 --> 01:08:49.544
Yeah. Well, the thing is...

01:08:50.962 --> 01:08:52.884
I didn't let you catch more.

01:08:53.844 --> 01:08:56.265
You caught 'em on your own.
You was quicker than I was.

01:08:56.307 --> 01:08:58.353
- Come on, Tucker.
- It's true.

01:08:58.394 --> 01:09:03.738
What I'm trying to tell you...
is that you're better than you think you are.

01:09:04.865 --> 01:09:07.243
Listen to me. That girl sees it.

01:09:08.287 --> 01:09:11.962
I've seen the way that the two of you
look at each other.

01:09:14.550 --> 01:09:16.179
You know, I think that she...

01:09:17.264 --> 01:09:19.184
really sees you for who you are.

01:09:20.770 --> 01:09:23.067
Who knows?
Maybe after this is all done...

01:09:24.277 --> 01:09:25.572
you two can...

01:09:26.532 --> 01:09:28.786
...date or something.

01:09:28.828 --> 01:09:32.920
- I doubt it.
- Dude, that's what I'm talking about.

01:09:32.962 --> 01:09:34.756
I don't want any more negativity.

01:09:36.134 --> 01:09:37.636
- OK.
- Stop it!

01:09:37.679 --> 01:09:40.058
- OK.
- You are a good man.

01:09:41.019 --> 01:09:42.354
You're smart...

01:09:43.399 --> 01:09:44.901
and you're strong...

01:09:45.944 --> 01:09:48.283
and you're not as ugly as you think you are.

01:09:48.325 --> 01:09:52.497
Thank you, Tucker.
That means a lot comin' from you.

01:09:52.540 --> 01:09:55.255
- Life is short.
- I know.

01:09:56.966 --> 01:10:00.431
You gotta go after what you want.
Go after her, Dale.

01:10:00.514 --> 01:10:03.269
She needs you now more than ever,

01:10:03.311 --> 01:10:07.737
especially cos she's always falling down
and hitting her head, knocking herself out.

01:10:07.779 --> 01:10:11.702
- But I don't even know where he took her.
- Jangers'll know.

01:10:14.375 --> 01:10:18.216
- OK, but I'm not leaving you here.
- No, no, no.

01:10:18.257 --> 01:10:20.929
I'll be fine. Go.

01:10:26.690 --> 01:10:29.404
- Friends forever?
- Best friends forever.

01:10:31.866 --> 01:10:33.035
Oh, Jesus!

01:10:33.119 --> 01:10:34.747
- God! Fuck...
- I'm sorry.

01:10:34.789 --> 01:10:36.417
OK.

01:10:39.005 --> 01:10:40.634
That hurt very much!

01:10:40.718 --> 01:10:42.972
I could tell. Just breathe in.

01:10:43.013 --> 01:10:44.474
Out through your mouth.

01:10:44.516 --> 01:10:46.437
Go get her. Go get her.

01:10:48.106 --> 01:10:49.944
- Do me a favor.
- Anything.

01:10:49.986 --> 01:10:53.074
Kick the shit out of that little
college dickhead for me, would you?

01:10:53.116 --> 01:10:56.706
I'm gonna shove my boot down
his fuckin' throat. You stay here, OK?

01:10:56.748 --> 01:10:58.251
Come on, Jangers, let's go.

01:11:19.249 --> 01:11:21.420
Good boy, Jangers. Good boy.

01:11:21.504 --> 01:11:25.136
OK. You gotta let me take it from here, OK, pup?

01:11:25.178 --> 01:11:28.309
Don't worry about me.
I know what I'm doing.

01:11:28.351 --> 01:11:30.355
More or less. OK, stay.

01:11:35.365 --> 01:11:36.992
What is the matter with you?

01:11:37.034 --> 01:11:39.455
What is the matter with me?

01:11:39.497 --> 01:11:43.964
Do you have any idea what
I've been through trying to save you?

01:11:44.005 --> 01:11:45.050
No.

01:11:46.010 --> 01:11:48.013
You've gone hillbilly on me, Allison.

01:11:49.266 --> 01:11:51.353
Now, I'm willing to forgive you...

01:11:51.395 --> 01:11:53.441
but you're gonna have to beg.

01:11:54.443 --> 01:11:55.529
Chad...

01:11:58.742 --> 01:12:00.036
Oh!

01:12:01.038 --> 01:12:03.794
That was just not a very nice apology kiss.

01:12:03.836 --> 01:12:06.508
You see, we're making up, Allie,

01:12:06.550 --> 01:12:08.596
so you have to be
more passionate than that!

01:12:08.637 --> 01:12:10.223
- Chad, please...
- That's a start.

01:12:10.265 --> 01:12:11.851
- Please...
- You're getting warmer.

01:12:11.893 --> 01:12:13.229
Just stop, please!

01:12:13.271 --> 01:12:15.775
No. I'm not gonna stop.

01:12:15.817 --> 01:12:17.863
I've only just begun.

01:12:41.785 --> 01:12:45.375
You want a killer hillbilly?
I'll show you a killer hillbilly.

01:13:07.667 --> 01:13:09.421
Allie! Allie! Hey, it's just me. Hey...

01:13:09.462 --> 01:13:10.882
- It's OK.
- Dale?

01:13:10.923 --> 01:13:12.636
- Yeah.
- What are you wearing?

01:13:12.678 --> 01:13:16.017
What? Oh, I thought it might look
kind of intimidating. Does it?

01:13:16.852 --> 01:13:18.898
- Yeah.
- Sweet.

01:13:20.358 --> 01:13:23.365
Dale, you wanna...
you wanna help me here?

01:13:23.449 --> 01:13:25.160
Oh, yeah. Hang on, I'm comin'.

01:13:26.495 --> 01:13:27.623
Hang on.

01:13:30.127 --> 01:13:33.425
- OK, what do we got here?
- Thank you for coming for me.

01:13:33.467 --> 01:13:36.724
It's no big deal.
I was headed over this way anyway, so...

01:13:44.279 --> 01:13:46.117
How sweet.

01:13:46.159 --> 01:13:51.001
The dim-witted hillbilly
is trying to save the girl of his dreams.

01:13:51.043 --> 01:13:52.379
What kind of knot is this?

01:13:52.420 --> 01:13:55.175
You think you're gonna win,
but you're wrong.

01:13:56.136 --> 01:13:58.891
It’s time to say goodbye to the girl.

01:13:58.975 --> 01:14:01.104
You shouldn't have betrayed me, Allison.

01:14:05.571 --> 01:14:07.826
No. Oh, jeez. No, no!

01:14:07.867 --> 01:14:09.495
- Oh, Dale! Dale!
- OK. OK.

01:14:13.461 --> 01:14:14.755
- OK, OK.
- Dale!

01:14:14.797 --> 01:14:17.760
Hold on! OK, rabbit comes out the tree,
rabbit goes around the tree...

01:14:17.802 --> 01:14:19.849
- Dale, come on!
- OK! Jesus, OK!

01:14:29.701 --> 01:14:31.580
Oh, that is really too bad.

01:14:31.622 --> 01:14:36.172
Are you OK, huh?
Because I didn't mean to...

01:14:41.390 --> 01:14:42.392
Dale!

01:15:01.888 --> 01:15:04.226
Dale!

01:15:09.611 --> 01:15:11.030
Dale!

01:15:23.012 --> 01:15:25.267
It's time for you to feel my pain.

01:15:26.477 --> 01:15:27.938
Bring it, frat bitch.

01:15:51.025 --> 01:15:55.074
- Dale, over here!
- Come on! Let's get outta here.

01:15:57.412 --> 01:16:00.335
Come on. Come on. Here! Come on!

01:16:00.418 --> 01:16:03.632
Go! Go, get up there.
Go. Come on. Quick, quick, quick.

01:16:05.844 --> 01:16:07.766
- Dale, here!
- Oh, yeah, give me that.

01:16:09.143 --> 01:16:10.479
Put a couple boxes on there.

01:16:10.521 --> 01:16:14.111
Oh, Jesus H Christ!
That kid is tough as nails.

01:16:14.152 --> 01:16:16.198
- Are you OK?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

01:16:16.240 --> 01:16:19.789
- OK. OK.
- Looks like no one's been here for a while.

01:16:19.831 --> 01:16:22.794
Yeah. What we need to find
is some kind of weapon,

01:16:22.836 --> 01:16:26.259
something preferably big and sharp
so I can stab him!

01:16:26.300 --> 01:16:27.721
Nah! Shit...

01:16:27.762 --> 01:16:31.019
Oh, hey! This might work, huh?

01:16:31.060 --> 01:16:32.104
Or not.

01:16:39.660 --> 01:16:41.789
Oh, my God. Dale?

01:16:41.831 --> 01:16:44.002
- What?
- Come here and look at this.

01:16:47.216 --> 01:16:48.260
Look.

01:16:48.302 --> 01:16:50.389
- What?
- Something look familiar?

01:16:50.431 --> 01:16:54.189
- Hey, ain't that that dead Sheriff right there?
- No, that picture.

01:16:54.230 --> 01:16:57.528
- Look at the guy in the middle.
- Oh, yeah.

01:16:57.570 --> 01:17:00.742
He looks just like that
Kentucky fried college kid down there.

01:17:00.784 --> 01:17:02.579
- Yeah.
- That's funny.

01:17:02.621 --> 01:17:07.339
And it says here, "The single survivor
leads police to the Memorial Day Killer.

01:17:07.380 --> 01:17:11.096
"The survivor is reported
to have been tortured and raped.

01:17:11.137 --> 01:17:13.851
"She's now undergoing
psychiatric evaluation."

01:17:15.980 --> 01:17:19.070
Think about it. He said his mother
was captured and his father...

01:17:19.112 --> 01:17:21.282
His father's body was never found.

01:17:23.035 --> 01:17:24.790
I think we've just found him.

01:17:24.873 --> 01:17:27.001
Holy S-H-I-T.

01:17:27.043 --> 01:17:29.089
Jesus Christ!

01:17:29.131 --> 01:17:30.717
Chad!

01:17:32.929 --> 01:17:35.016
- Time to die, freak!
- Wait!

01:17:35.058 --> 01:17:36.395
Just wait! Wait, wait!

01:17:36.437 --> 01:17:38.149
Wait, Chad! Wait!

01:17:38.858 --> 01:17:40.528
- You're a hillbilly, too!
- Shut up!

01:17:40.570 --> 01:17:42.197
No! Look!

01:17:42.239 --> 01:17:44.285
That's your real father.
Right there!

01:17:45.495 --> 01:17:47.207
No. No!

01:17:47.249 --> 01:17:49.295
It's true, Chad. You're half hillbilly.

01:17:52.050 --> 01:17:53.595
It can't be.

01:17:56.725 --> 01:17:58.772
They lied to me!

01:18:00.274 --> 01:18:02.320
How could they?

01:18:02.361 --> 01:18:04.282
Maybe they didn't want you
to know the truth.

01:18:04.365 --> 01:18:06.160
There is no truth!

01:18:06.828 --> 01:18:09.459
Everything is a lie!

01:18:13.257 --> 01:18:15.678
- What did you do?
- Anthemis nobilis.

01:18:15.720 --> 01:18:18.016
- What?
- It's the ingredient in chamomile tea

01:18:18.058 --> 01:18:22.526
that causes an anaphylactic reaction
in rare cases where people are allergic to it.

01:18:22.567 --> 01:18:24.488
Like I said, I remember weird stuff.

01:18:24.530 --> 01:18:27.535
But he'll be OK,
as long as we get him his inhaler.

01:18:34.841 --> 01:18:36.427
Or not.

01:18:46.363 --> 01:18:48.993
OK, here we go. And, you ready?

01:18:49.034 --> 01:18:52.291
- Uh, yeah, wait. My teeth. Do I got any...
- Teeth are clear.

01:18:52.332 --> 01:18:54.880
- Clear? OK, just give me a second.
- And we're rolling.

01:18:58.386 --> 01:19:02.603
The chaos and confusion
of what transpired here last night

01:19:02.644 --> 01:19:04.356
is still being unraveled.

01:19:04.398 --> 01:19:07.112
What appears to be a tragic mass suicide

01:19:07.154 --> 01:19:10.619
involving a group of
mentally unstable college kids

01:19:10.660 --> 01:19:15.795
may in fact be the work of a lone deranged
killer whose body has yet to be found.

01:19:15.837 --> 01:19:19.677
- The killings happened on the ....
- Knock knock. Hey!

01:19:21.223 --> 01:19:24.603
- Hey, buddy. How you feeling?
- I'm feeling...

01:19:25.313 --> 01:19:27.067
high on prescription medication.

01:19:27.150 --> 01:19:29.321
Yeah, looks like it.

01:19:30.031 --> 01:19:31.867
They found my fingers.

01:19:32.827 --> 01:19:34.247
Check it out.

01:19:34.288 --> 01:19:36.334
- Yeah.
- I got to tell you...

01:19:37.671 --> 01:19:39.883
I don't remember that one looking that way.

01:19:39.925 --> 01:19:42.137
Does that look funny to you?

01:19:42.179 --> 01:19:43.557
No. No, not really.

01:19:45.060 --> 01:19:47.524
That looks natural. It's good.

01:19:47.566 --> 01:19:49.485
By the way, I brought you something.

01:19:49.527 --> 01:19:51.614
- Shut your eyes, OK?
- All right.

01:19:51.656 --> 01:19:53.242
OK, open them.

01:19:54.244 --> 01:19:55.914
Oh...

01:19:55.956 --> 01:19:58.168
- Oh, buddy.
- That's a PBR, buddy.

01:19:58.210 --> 01:20:01.300
That...
that's a thing of beauty.

01:20:01.383 --> 01:20:03.012
- It's cold, too, should be.
- Oh, oh...

01:20:03.053 --> 01:20:04.431
Look what else I got you.

01:20:04.514 --> 01:20:07.269
A bendy straw,
your favorite sipping utensil.

01:20:07.352 --> 01:20:09.356
There you go.

01:20:09.398 --> 01:20:11.737
Mmm. Mm!

01:20:11.778 --> 01:20:14.951
Don't choke. I'm gonna let you rest.
You enjoy that, OK?

01:20:14.993 --> 01:20:17.873
Drink the whole thing.
When I come back, I'm gonna have more.

01:20:17.915 --> 01:20:19.250
- Dale?
- Yeah?

01:20:20.002 --> 01:20:21.464
Did you ask her?

01:20:22.925 --> 01:20:26.933
- Ask her what?
- Did you ask her out, for God's sake?

01:20:26.974 --> 01:20:29.729
Oh. Well ...

01:20:31.231 --> 01:20:34.822
I was gonna, but then
I never actually got the chance, so...

01:20:34.864 --> 01:20:35.908
Dale!

01:20:35.950 --> 01:20:39.081
You are hopeless,
you know that? You're hopeless.

01:20:39.122 --> 01:20:43.340
Yeah. You're probably right about that.

01:20:44.299 --> 01:20:45.551
Except for...

01:20:45.635 --> 01:20:49.935
she kinda mentioned to me
that she's a pretty darn good bowler, so...

01:20:49.977 --> 01:20:51.020
we're goin' bowling.

01:20:53.484 --> 01:20:56.114
- You little dickhead.
- I'm outta here.

01:21:00.956 --> 01:21:02.918
Whoo! Yes.

01:21:02.960 --> 01:21:07.428
- Dale Dobson, you are one lucky man.
- I guess it's just beginner's luck.

01:21:07.469 --> 01:21:10.892
That girl has got an amazing set...
of bowling fingers.

01:21:10.934 --> 01:21:14.232
I know.
Listen, let me tell you something, OK?

01:21:14.274 --> 01:21:17.113
Life is short, BJ.
You have to go after what you want,

01:21:17.155 --> 01:21:19.993
because it sure as heck fire
ain't gonna just fall right into your lap.

01:21:20.035 --> 01:21:22.582
- You know somethin'? You're right.
- I know.

01:21:22.665 --> 01:21:25.503
- I'm gonna go talk to her.
- OK. Right, now, listen to me, though.

01:21:25.587 --> 01:21:28.134
Don't be nervous, and just be yourself, OK?

01:21:28.217 --> 01:21:29.428
Yeah.

01:21:29.470 --> 01:21:31.390
You got 'er. Go, buddy.

01:21:33.060 --> 01:21:34.103
Hey.

01:21:34.145 --> 01:21:36.859
- I'm pretty good at this, aren't I?
- You are. That was great.

01:21:36.901 --> 01:21:41.368
Listen, Allie, I hope you don't think
this is too stupid or whatever,

01:21:41.409 --> 01:21:43.497
but I got you a little something.

01:21:44.540 --> 01:21:47.045
Dale, that's so sweet.
You didn't have to do that.

01:21:47.087 --> 01:21:48.382
I know. I wanted to.

01:21:49.467 --> 01:21:51.262
Oh, my gosh.

01:21:51.304 --> 01:21:55.186
- You know what that is?
- Yes, it's a... it's a helmet.

01:21:55.228 --> 01:21:56.814
It's a pink helmet.

01:21:56.855 --> 01:22:00.530
I think, you know, it might just be better if
you wear that every day from now on, so...

01:22:00.614 --> 01:22:02.575
- OK, thank you.
- You're welcome.

01:22:02.617 --> 01:22:04.078
It's perfect.

01:22:05.748 --> 01:22:07.501
So, listen, Dale, I'm, uh...

01:22:07.584 --> 01:22:10.675
I'm really sorry about
everything that happened.

01:22:10.717 --> 01:22:13.304
What do you mean?
For what? I had a great time.

01:22:13.346 --> 01:22:17.396
I mean, except for all the people dying, when
they were bleeding on us and everything.

01:22:17.438 --> 01:22:20.484
That wasn't so much fun,
but...you know...

01:22:21.487 --> 01:22:23.616
I enjoyed every minute
I got to spend with you.

01:22:23.658 --> 01:22:26.371
- Dale...
- You know what? Let me just say this,

01:22:26.413 --> 01:22:31.005
cos I don't know if we're ever gonna get
to spend this kind of time together again,

01:22:31.047 --> 01:22:32.676
and I want to let you know that I...

01:22:34.637 --> 01:22:36.266
I feel the same way.

01:22:38.519 --> 01:22:40.565
- Really?
- Really.

01:22:42.694 --> 01:22:44.323
BJ!

01:22:45.993 --> 01:22:48.664
Oh, my God, should we go help her?

01:22:48.706 --> 01:22:49.792
Hell, no.

01:22:55.135 --> 01:22:56.179
Whatever.
