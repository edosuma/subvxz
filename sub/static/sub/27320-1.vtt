[phone ringing]

01:19.611 --> 01:20.727
Hi, Mina.

01:20.728 --> 01:22.414
[Mina]Mom, Lola says, n "Don't forget the toilet paper."

01:22.416 --> 01:24.073
It's the only thing I'm buying, why would I forget it?

01:24.074 --> 01:26.701
I'm just telling you what Lola said.

01:26.702 --> 01:27.994
Tell your Lola that I have it

01:27.995 --> 01:30.122
and I'm already on the bus.

01:30.123 --> 01:31.789
Can you get me some Green Tea Kit Kats?

01:31.791 --> 01:33.500
[Shelly] I already told you I'm on the bus, Mina.

01:33.501 --> 01:35.586
There's gonna be a lot of sweets tonight.

01:35.587 --> 01:37.380
Tell your Lola not to put any sweets out until I get home.

01:37.381 --> 01:40.175
[Mina] Okay. Dad said to get his cigarettes too.

01:40.176 --> 01:43.240
-Okay, I'll get his cigarettes. -So can you get me the Kit Kats, then?

01:44.096 --> 01:47.807
Yes, Mina, I'll get your Kit Kats.

01:47.808 --> 01:50.894
- Green Tea Kit Kats, okay? - Yes, Mina.

01:50.895 --> 01:52.812
- Thanks, mom. - [Lola] It's Troy's favorite.

01:52.813 --> 01:54.731
Wait a minute. Did you tell your mom?

01:54.732 --> 01:56.650
Yeah, Mom said to put out all the sweets before she gets home.

01:56.651 --> 02:00.405
Are you sure your mom is bringing the mango cake?

02:00.406 --> 02:03.200
[Tiva] Yes, Auntie. My mom is bringing the mango cake.

02:03.201 --> 02:05.660
I saw her making it from scratch.

02:05.661 --> 02:07.287
Scratch? Why? She can buy it from Red Ribbon.

02:07.288 --> 02:10.916
Well, it'll be better than Red Ribbon.

02:10.917 --> 02:12.460
Yeah, okay, because it's Troy's favorite.

02:12.461 --> 02:14.753
Whoa, it's Troy's favorite. So basically, it'll piss Troy off, right?

02:14.754 --> 02:15.661
[Lola] Tiva.

02:15.662 --> 02:18.383
I don't know how you could even live with Troy.

02:18.384 --> 02:20.969
- I'd be so depressed. - Depression is for white people.

02:20.970 --> 02:22.723
Depression is for white people. Okay, Auntie.

02:22.724 --> 02:24.515
I've gotta go. I'm almost at the airport now.

02:24.516 --> 02:28.768
- Tiva's almost at the airport and you're in Denver?

02:28.769 --> 02:31.272
Only for a little while. I'm literally running to catch my connecting flight.

02:31.273 --> 02:35.067
-You could've texted me, Moe. -How was I gonna do that, Declan, huh?

02:35.067 --> 02:38.112
By the time I realized I was late, I was already up in the air.

02:38.113 --> 02:40.864
-You could've messaged, emailed. -I am not paying for Wi-Fi on a plane.

02:40.865 --> 02:44.202
- It's way too expensive. - You are so cheap.

02:44.203 --> 02:46.413
I gotta get off. You're racking up my minutes.

02:46.414 --> 02:48.248
Alright. I'll let everybody know you'll be late,

02:48.249 --> 02:49.916
but can you atnleast text Tiva to let her know?

02:49.917 --> 02:52.043
Fine, I'll text her. Fuckin A, man. Pull the stick out of your ass.

02:52.045 --> 02:53.067
Excuse me?

02:53.067 --> 02:56.433
You know I didn't mean it like that. I'll call you when I land.

02:58.594 --> 03:01.021
[car honking]

03:02.764 --> 03:03.974
- What's up, cuz? - What up, cuz?

03:03.975 --> 03:06.268
[chuckles]

03:06.269 --> 03:07.769
People who hear us will think we're Mexican.

03:07.770 --> 03:09.438
People always think we're Mexican.

03:09.439 --> 03:11.566
Pack of Newports.

03:11.567 --> 03:13.984
-Do you have Green Tea Kit Kats? -Green Tea Kit Kats? What is that? A thing?

03:13.985 --> 03:18.498
It doesn't matter.

03:53.779 --> 03:58.408
Wow, you have been keeping busy.

03:58.409 --> 03:59.867
That's why I spent four months in Mali.

03:59.868 --> 04:01.744
- Wow, Mali, Africa? - No, Molly Ringwald.

04:01.745 --> 04:05.040
- Wow, sobra. -[chuckles]

04:05.041 --> 04:06.833
[voice mail] Just got a text from Moe.

04:06.834 --> 04:09.086
"Fuckin a man. Gonna be a few hours late, sorry."

04:09.087 --> 04:12.881
[chuckles] He's not fucking a man.

04:12.882 --> 04:14.810
He's saying, "Fuckin A, man."

04:16.512 --> 04:19.064
Julie, I'm not stressed. I just hate my family, you know.

04:19.065 --> 04:20.957
You don't hate your family. I do and Declan

04:20.957 --> 04:22.892
was one person who I thought was on my side.

04:22.893 --> 04:26.146
Just because he wants you to be on time, you think that he's not on your side?

04:26.147 --> 04:28.941
I should shut this down. We're racking up limits.

04:28.942 --> 04:31.068
This isn't about Declan at all, is it?

04:31.069 --> 04:32.861
You think I'm stressed about you?

04:32.862 --> 04:34.780
-Uh, I didn't say you're stressed about me. -You just did.

04:34.781 --> 04:37.325
- No, I said... - Julie, I heard what you said.

04:37.326 --> 04:39.702
Moe, calm down. Just answer me this, did you tell your family about us yet?

04:39.703 --> 04:41.283
[Tiva] Oh, no, you didn't.

04:41.284 --> 04:44.207
[Declan] I just feel more at home in New York.

04:44.207 --> 04:45.007
[Tiva] Not my thing.

04:45.008 --> 04:47.253
Well, you should come visit and experience my New York.

04:47.254 --> 04:51.966
What's so great about your New York?

04:51.967 --> 04:54.093
Well, for one, [chuckles] there's actual black people.

04:54.094 --> 04:57.179
[Tiva] We have black folk in Oakland.

04:57.180 --> 04:58.889
Yeah, but the train stops running after midnight.

04:58.890 --> 05:01.226
-We have better produce here. -But the food choice is better in New York.

05:01.227 --> 05:02.223
[Tiva] Even Filipino food?

05:02.224 --> 05:04.104
[Declan] It actually has amazing Filipino food.

05:04.105 --> 05:07.567
[Tiva] So what's the number one reason why you love New York?

05:07.568 --> 05:11.404
[Declan] My family is not there.

05:11.405 --> 05:13.790
[music]

05:13.990 --> 05:15.292
[doorbell rings]

05:22.791 --> 05:28.505
Tiva, what are you doing? Troy gets pissed if you ring the doorbell more than once.

05:28.506 --> 05:32.217
Who the fuck is ringing the doorbell?

05:32.218 --> 05:34.094
Sorry, we didn't know if anybody was home, uh...

05:34.095 --> 05:36.723
I'm just fucking with you, man, what's up, Dec?

05:36.724 --> 05:39.485
I got the surround sound all calibrated, man.

05:41.187 --> 05:43.032
It sounds like a movie theatre in here now.

05:43.033 --> 05:43.647
Nice.

05:43.648 --> 05:46.358
Yeah, I'll put on the, uh, Lion King later, you'll see.

05:46.359 --> 05:48.943
- Declan. [laughs] - Hi, mom.

05:48.944 --> 05:50.946
- Merry Christmas, Anak. -Hi, Auntie Tiva.

05:50.947 --> 05:53.658
- Hi, Mina. Where can I put this? - I'll take it.

05:53.659 --> 05:57.662
-Hi, uncle Declan. -Hi, Mina. Gosh, you're getting so tall.

05:57.663 --> 06:01.968
- Look what I made. - Oh, wow, what's that?

06:02.251 --> 06:06.922
- It's an ornament. - Oh, is that you?

06:06.923 --> 06:09.509
- Yeah. - And is that your dad?

06:09.510 --> 06:11.978
-No, that's you. -Oh, I love it, Mina. Uh, what is that?

06:13.514 --> 06:18.100
- It's the birth of Christ. - Oh.

06:18.101 --> 06:21.772
- See? Jesus. - Huh?

06:21.773 --> 06:26.036
Uh, you know, when you were really small, you used to draw a lot of monsters.

06:26.110 --> 06:30.740
- I did? - Yeah, they were scary.

06:30.741 --> 06:33.283
You don't actually believe in monsters, do you?

06:33.284 --> 06:35.994
I like your drawings, Mina. You're a really good drawer.

06:35.995 --> 06:39.424
-Mina, what do you say? -Yeah, Mina, don't be rude. -Thank you.

06:40.125 --> 06:44.505
- What the fuck took you so long? - Hi, Shelly.

06:44.506 --> 06:47.758
Merry Christmas, Declan.

06:47.759 --> 06:52.388
Hey, Dec you're hugging my wife a little passionately, man.

06:52.389 --> 06:54.579
Beginning to didn't think this whole gay thing's fake.

06:54.580 --> 06:55.609
Yeah, right.

06:56.893 --> 06:59.187
Mom, I asked for Green Tea Kit Kats. This is a Cliff Bar.

06:59.188 --> 07:02.817
What are all the sweets doing out?

07:02.818 --> 07:05.443
[Lola] Oh, Mina told me to put all the sweets out.

07:05.444 --> 07:08.698
I told her don't put it out, not until I get home.

07:08.699 --> 07:11.701
-Okay, I'm just doing what I was told. -It doesn't matter.

07:11.702 --> 07:16.122
I'm home now. I just didn't want Mina eating a bunch of sweets before I got home.

07:16.123 --> 07:19.751
No rest for the weary, Shelly.

07:19.752 --> 07:24.631
- [Mina] Pikachu... - [Tiva] Merry Christmas

07:24.632 --> 07:26.425
- Merry Christmas, Tiva. - [Declan] All I know is Pikachu.

07:26.426 --> 07:28.678
- How are you doing? - Where's Moe?

07:28.679 --> 07:30.555
Uh, he's running late. He's still on the plane.

07:30.556 --> 07:31.202
What?

07:31.203 --> 07:33.140
He promises to be home, but doesn't make it.

07:33.141 --> 07:35.685
Looks like we know which one of us took after dad.

07:35.686 --> 07:38.354
Uh, anybody heard from dad?

07:38.355 --> 07:40.899
Nobody's heard from him in years. Right, babe?

07:40.900 --> 07:43.453
-[sighs] Dec, you want a beer? Yeah. -Um, sure, why not.

07:44.863 --> 07:48.832
It's a shame. Mina's never met her Lolo.

07:49.618 --> 07:52.036
She doesn't need her Lolo as long as she has her Lola.

07:52.037 --> 07:55.498
- Right, Mina? - Yeah.

07:55.499 --> 07:56.244
Mm, remember that.

07:56.245 --> 07:58.125
Now why are you putting all the sweets away?

07:58.126 --> 08:02.547
- Huh? - Your mother's deaf.

08:02.548 --> 08:05.342
- What? - Nothing. I'll get it myself.

08:05.343 --> 08:08.970
Hey, Dec, you wanna see my man cave?

08:08.971 --> 08:13.276
Check that shit out, man. Xbox 1, PS4 Pro, we'll play Karate Champ later.

08:14.311 --> 08:18.981
-You have a disk playing. -I probably forgot to turn it off.

08:18.982 --> 08:22.569
[Declan] Oh, straight porn.

08:22.570 --> 08:25.572
You're funny, man. Who calls it straight porn?

08:25.573 --> 08:29.409
[Declan] Damn, that's a barbecue.

08:29.410 --> 08:32.078
When the whole family comes over, I don't want them anywhere near this thing.

08:32.080 --> 08:36.209
Ah, why not?

08:36.210 --> 08:39.931
Because I don't like bitches all up on my grill. [laughs]

08:40.463 --> 08:44.769
[Troy] This is where you'll be sleeping.

08:45.261 --> 08:46.970
[Declan] Oh, I'm not sleeping in my room?

08:46.971 --> 08:48.806
- No, we gave that to Mina. - Oh, she has her own room now?

08:48.807 --> 08:51.810
- She's not a baby anymore, Dec. - Karaoke?

08:51.811 --> 08:56.146
Shelly actually asked me why I bought that. She keeps forgetting.

08:56.147 --> 09:00.485
- Forgetting what? - Don't tell me you forgot?

09:00.486 --> 09:04.833
Um, man, I-I think I know what you're talking about, but I'm not sure.

09:05.701 --> 09:09.035
-That I was gonna be a part of Kai? -Kai?

09:09.036 --> 09:13.207
- Yeah. - The Boy Band?

09:13.208 --> 09:15.669
- See? You remember. - Yeah.

09:15.670 --> 09:19.932
I can't wait to finish city college so I can transfer.

09:20.758 --> 09:24.177
-Transfer? -Yeah, I wanna transfer SF State.

09:24.178 --> 09:27.598
Hey, Shelly, can we turn the TV down a little bit?

09:27.599 --> 09:29.934
You have to ask Troy if that's okay.

09:29.935 --> 09:31.547
I have to ask Troy if it's okay to turn the TV down?

09:31.548 --> 09:32.144
Here's your beer.

09:32.145 --> 09:35.899
-Mom, what time is everybody getting here? -Six.

09:35.900 --> 09:39.318
Okay, cool, that gives me some time. I'm gonna smoke.

09:39.319 --> 09:42.155
- Shelly, you got my smokes? - Yeah, they're on the table.

09:42.156 --> 09:44.470
Hey, Troy, can I turn the TV down a little bit?

09:44.471 --> 09:45.242
What for?

09:45.243 --> 09:48.704
You got matches?

09:48.705 --> 09:50.790
Oh, I thought you had your lighter.

09:50.790 --> 09:54.711
-You know my lighter died. -Oh, I... I thought you had your lighter.

09:54.712 --> 09:59.466
So, did you or did you not get matches?

09:59.467 --> 10:02.062
No, sorry, babe.

10:03.471 --> 10:05.263
-Oh, what about the thing for barbecue? -What?

10:05.264 --> 10:09.310
That thing for barbecue.

10:09.311 --> 10:11.270
I heard you. You're just saying the same thing twice.

10:11.271 --> 10:13.481
Yeah, the barbecue thing.

10:13.482 --> 10:15.399
You mean the lighter? Yeah, I'm gonna have to use that now.

10:15.400 --> 10:18.528
Troy, I actually have to go to the store. Do you want me to get you a lighter?

10:18.529 --> 10:21.239
Dude, hold on. I can hardly hear you.

10:21.240 --> 10:24.583
I said I'm heading down to the store anyway. You want me to get you a lighter?

10:26.914 --> 10:30.207
No, man. Just relax, finish your beer. What do you need at the store?

10:30.208 --> 10:33.929
I have to get some gin for the cocktails I'm making tonight.

10:35.297 --> 10:38.601
-What? You don't think we got gin? -Oh, you have gin?

10:39.384 --> 10:44.389
Dude, we have everything. This is a Santos house, man.

10:44.390 --> 10:48.770
You think we're not gonna be fully stocked? [laughs]

10:48.771 --> 10:51.824
Shelly, show Dec the booze.

10:53.316 --> 10:55.702
Shelly, you're always forgetting something.

10:58.197 --> 11:01.909
[glasses clanking]

11:01.910 --> 11:03.753
[festive music]

11:16.050 --> 11:21.263
-Who wants mango cake? -Ooh-wee. You brought my favorite.

11:21.264 --> 11:22.233
Hi, Troy.

11:22.234 --> 11:25.142
Auntie Divi, I heard you made this cake for me.

11:25.143 --> 11:28.729
Well, I made it, yeah.

11:28.730 --> 11:30.188
Shelly, get over here.

11:30.189 --> 11:31.858
Look at that. Looks even better than Red Ribbon.

11:31.859 --> 11:35.278
- Of course it does. - Is that the mango cake?

11:35.279 --> 11:38.073
-Declan, oh, my goodness. -Been a while, right? -Oh, cool.

11:38.074 --> 11:42.536
- How's New York? - It's good.

11:42.537 --> 11:44.621
Declan came back from New York to judge us.

11:44.622 --> 11:47.499
Merry Christmas, Uncle Boy.

11:47.500 --> 11:50.095
[festive music]

11:51.171 --> 11:53.891
That's a huge grill.

11:55.467 --> 11:58.428
Yeah, I haven't seen a grill that big since Madonna's mom.

11:58.429 --> 12:01.724
[chuckles] Why doesn't Troy barbecue if he's so proud of it?

12:01.725 --> 12:05.404
I think tonight's his night to prove that he's a real singer.

12:06.771 --> 12:10.066
Oh, yeah. Wasn't he supposed to join Jodeci or some shit?

12:10.067 --> 12:14.278
- Kai. - Kai?

12:14.279 --> 12:16.364
He says he was supposed to be a part of Kai?

12:16.365 --> 12:18.575
You know how many people in San Francisco actually know Kai?

12:18.576 --> 12:21.328
Yeah, but don't burst his bubble.

12:21.329 --> 12:23.789
He'll probably bash your head in.

12:23.790 --> 12:26.083
Is that what happened at his last job?

12:26.084 --> 12:27.960
No one knows what happened at his last job.

12:27.961 --> 12:30.588
All I know is he called his mom to pick him up saying he quit, but when she got there,

12:30.589 --> 12:33.122
she said two security guards were escorting him out.

12:33.123 --> 12:33.967
Lovely.

12:33.968 --> 12:37.598
I can't imagine what it's like living with him.

12:37.599 --> 12:38.931
I can't either.

12:38.932 --> 12:43.227
Blocked it from my mind.

12:43.228 --> 12:45.312
But didn't he actually bash some guys head in, though?

12:45.313 --> 12:47.982
- That was the job before that. - Jesus.

12:47.983 --> 12:50.818
Yeah, he went to jail for a while for that.

12:50.819 --> 12:53.613
There you are.

12:53.614 --> 12:55.540
- What are you guys doing? - Smoking.

12:58.244 --> 13:01.371
- Yeah, you want some? - No, I got my own.

13:01.372 --> 13:04.676
- Oh, this is the good stuff. - Oh, I see what you're smoking.

13:19.475 --> 13:23.947
It's not meat.

13:24.690 --> 13:25.991
Cheers.

13:28.735 --> 13:30.820
Hey.

13:30.821 --> 13:32.331
Shelly, does Troy hit you?

13:36.828 --> 13:38.547
Oh, my god. What a question?

13:41.290 --> 13:43.834
Yeah, well, it's a real question.

13:43.835 --> 13:45.544
Hi, Shelly. Merry Christmas.

13:45.545 --> 13:47.255
Can I have a beer? Does Troy hit you?

13:47.256 --> 13:49.257
Thank you.

13:49.258 --> 13:50.675
- Ah, very nice. - I'll be right back.

13:50.676 --> 13:52.427
Let me get another beer.

13:52.428 --> 13:54.429
Troy, why don't you sing one of the Kai songs?

13:54.430 --> 13:56.848
I know right. I wish they had karaoke tracks of Kai.

13:56.849 --> 14:00.185
Well, didn't you audition for them?

14:00.186 --> 14:02.031
Didn't you audition with one of their songs?

14:02.032 --> 14:02.646
Ahem.

14:02.647 --> 14:05.983
-You want to see the audition tape? -Oh, uh.

14:05.984 --> 14:09.695
Babe, get everyone to check out my audition tape.

14:09.696 --> 14:12.615
Okay, babe. I should get back to Troy.

14:12.616 --> 14:14.993
Wait, Shelly. I volunteer at this place called Alway.

14:14.994 --> 14:18.089
If you have time tomorrow, can we chat?

14:19.832 --> 14:21.926
Sure.

14:23.837 --> 14:26.422
- Shh, it's starting. - Looks like VHS.

14:26.423 --> 14:28.758
Shut up.

14:28.759 --> 14:30.478
Hi. My name is Troy Santos.

[continues singing]

14:58.083 --> 15:01.219
[in Spanish] What's happening?

15:01.711 --> 15:04.598
-Moe,Anak. -Mom. -Hi.

15:09.511 --> 15:13.389
-Kinda late, man. -Kinda late, man. -Where's Julie?

15:13.390 --> 15:17.477
-Oh, it's just me. Julie couldn't make it. -Why not?

15:17.478 --> 15:20.688
- Hey, good to see you. - Hi, Moe.

15:20.689 --> 15:22.660
- What's up, Moe? - Good to see you.

15:25.278 --> 15:27.405
Why not, Moe?

15:27.406 --> 15:28.873
Here, bro.

15:29.825 --> 15:31.377
[Christmas music]

15:58.106 --> 16:03.245
- Oh, what is this? - It's a digital keychain.

16:04.487 --> 16:09.533
I asked everyone to email me pictures of themselves.

16:09.534 --> 16:12.589
So now, you can carry them with you everywhere you go.

16:16.750 --> 16:21.588
- Merry Christmas to Inang. - Merry Christmas.

16:21.589 --> 16:25.634
- Merry Christmas, Inang. - You all look fat.

16:25.635 --> 16:28.637
[laughter]

16:28.638 --> 16:30.806
It's because of the camera. It just makes us look fat, Inang.

16:30.807 --> 16:33.643
No, it's you're fat that make you look fat.

16:33.644 --> 16:36.656
[laughter]

16:43.947 --> 16:48.743
Okay, you speak English. My English enough.

16:48.744 --> 16:52.038
[clears throat] We just want to say how contented we are

16:52.039 --> 16:56.001
of our togetherness in the day of our Lord, Jesus Christ.

16:56.002 --> 17:01.182
And it heartens me to the arrival of Moe and Declan

17:01.383 --> 17:06.762
visiting from the East Coast of the United States of America.

17:06.762 --> 17:11.477
Talking to you, Inang, via the Internet

17:11.478 --> 17:14.364
with the help of this new technology called Skype.

17:15.689 --> 17:18.867
So that we can be all together again

17:20.403 --> 17:24.958
with the veritable cornucopia of, uh, food.

17:25.617 --> 17:30.538
- Especially mango cake. [laughs] - Hold on, Troy.

17:30.539 --> 17:33.708
Let someone else do the talking for a moment.

17:33.709 --> 17:36.532
And we are blessed of these wonderful blessings bestowed upon us.

17:40.591 --> 17:45.565
With that, we'll just segue to this.

17:47.349 --> 17:50.194
[somber music]

17:51.687 --> 17:55.157
See?

17:55.649 --> 17:56.984
The trick is to have self-control

17:56.985 --> 17:59.404
and to know how far your arms extend.

17:59.405 --> 18:01.531
See my arms?

18:01.532 --> 18:02.864
Okay, we have to go.

18:02.865 --> 18:04.459
- Thank you, Manang. - Okay.

18:07.079 --> 18:09.205
-Come on, we're going to be late. -Where's Aria?

18:09.206 --> 18:12.750
Be careful, honey.

18:12.751 --> 18:14.669
What? There's no danger.

18:14.670 --> 18:16.588
You underestimate my precision.

18:16.589 --> 18:19.810
- Do something. - What do you want me to do?

18:19.843 --> 18:23.021
- Boy, please. - She likes it.

18:24.390 --> 18:26.150
[making kung-fu noises]

18:27.351 --> 18:30.362

Troy?

[laughs]

18:35.569 --> 18:38.204
Troy.

18:39.072 --> 18:40.156
[sound of hot fire]

18:40.157 --> 18:42.491
Look, Auntie Divi left her casserole dish.

18:42.492 --> 18:45.828
Oh, that's her veggie dish.

18:45.829 --> 18:48.623
I think it's supposed to taste like meat.

18:48.624 --> 18:51.427
-Where are the boys? -They left the mess for us girls to clean.

18:57.383 --> 19:02.397
- Let me get one of those. - Yeah, sure.

19:15.570 --> 19:19.948
So, how's it going man?

19:19.949 --> 19:22.126
Where are you working at now?

19:23.703 --> 19:28.384
- No job? - I'm in between.

19:31.170 --> 19:35.715
Still got that wind chime, huh?

19:35.716 --> 19:37.811
Of course.

19:38.595 --> 19:41.098
It doesn't sound the same like it did when we were kids.

19:41.473 --> 19:44.643
One of the, uh, ahem...

19:44.644 --> 19:47.061
One of the, uh, chimes doesn't, uh, ring anymore.

19:47.062 --> 19:50.940
That sound would drive me crazy.

19:50.941 --> 19:52.651
Like someone ringing the doorbell over and over again.

19:52.652 --> 19:55.821
[fog horn]

19:55.822 --> 19:58.073
There's a fog horn.

19:58.074 --> 20:00.377
- Cold, huh? - Yeah.

20:00.993 --> 20:03.547
You don't know cold till you've been shoving snow off your stoop in Philadelphia.

20:04.081 --> 20:07.467
Declan probably has to deal with that shit all the time in New York.

20:08.293 --> 20:11.389
It sounds like hell.

20:12.590 --> 20:14.633
- It can be, man. - So why did you guys leave then?

20:14.634 --> 20:18.095
Seriously? You mean instead of staying here?

20:18.096 --> 20:21.232
- Yeah. - Shit, you're serious.

20:22.058 --> 20:25.195
No, I'm not serious.

20:30.151 --> 20:35.281
-You heard from dad? -You're getting all serious, man.

20:35.282 --> 20:39.201
-Pft, it's Christmas. I'm just asking. -You're just drunk.

20:39.202 --> 20:43.164
-Christmas always makes me think of dad. -Yeah, me too.

20:43.165 --> 20:46.083
Reminds me of that one Christmas where dad kicked me out of the house.

20:46.084 --> 20:48.545
Or about the time he took me and slammed my head

20:48.546 --> 20:51.047
into the stone fireplace over and over again.

20:51.048 --> 20:53.383
Yeah, I don't remember that.

20:53.384 --> 20:55.886
But it did happen.

20:55.887 --> 20:57.430
No, I'm sure it did. It's just...

20:57.431 --> 20:59.733
- I'm going to sleep, man. - Yeah.

21:01.059 --> 21:04.696
-Coming in? -Yeah, I'm just going to finish my smoke.

21:11.069 --> 21:15.583
[ominous music]

21:53.157 --> 21:58.538
-[Shelly] Did you get drunk last night? -[Tiva] No, not really.

21:58.539 --> 22:01.082
I just had a couple of drinks, but that's about it.

22:01.083 --> 22:03.718
- Troy got drunk. - Yeah, I saw.

22:04.628 --> 22:06.691
I guess that's why we're here talking, right?

22:09.509 --> 22:11.802
To talk about Troy?

22:11.803 --> 22:13.939
This is hard.

22:14.848 --> 22:17.224
I guess to answer your question from last night.

22:17.225 --> 22:20.236
Yeah, yeah, he hits me.

22:21.104 --> 22:23.727
One time I filed a temporary restraining order against him.

22:26.277 --> 22:27.048
What happened?

22:27.049 --> 22:29.661
He came back. He just made sure that we kept the blinds closed

22:30.072 --> 22:35.160
-so the police wouldn't see him there. -Huh, what?

22:35.161 --> 22:39.833
Yeah, it's like nothing ever happened. He just acted like we were all on his side.

22:39.834 --> 22:43.878
- What did Auntie Prisca do? - She just took him back in.

22:43.879 --> 22:48.300
Didn't even ask how I felt about it.

22:48.301 --> 22:50.352
Shelly, I can take you to Alway.

22:51.805 --> 22:54.548
They help women like you. You do know you have options, right?

23:00.230 --> 23:04.442
Does he hit Mina?

23:04.443 --> 23:06.328
I don't know.

23:08.781 --> 23:12.418
If you need a place to stay, you can stay with me, or if Mina needs a place to stay

23:14.203 --> 23:17.007
or if you decide that you want to stay with Troy,

23:19.208 --> 23:22.253
I'll respect that too.

23:22.254 --> 23:24.464
- You will? - Yes.

23:24.465 --> 23:26.842
- Really? - Of course.

23:26.843 --> 23:28.719
Because when I filed a temporary restraining order against him

23:28.720 --> 23:31.764
no one seemed to respect me,

23:31.765 --> 23:33.515
like I'd done something against family or something.

23:33.516 --> 23:36.644
Prisca would ask me how I was doing physically,

23:36.645 --> 23:38.729
but she just kept talking about how worried she was about Troy.

23:38.730 --> 23:41.691
Your mom wouldn't even talk to her about it.

23:41.692 --> 23:44.611
-My mom's the "no drama" kind of woman. -Her own sister?

23:44.612 --> 23:47.614
I didn't know. I'm sorry.

23:47.615 --> 23:49.741
And then when it would come up, it was this annoyance

23:49.742 --> 23:52.243
like I was some whiny bitch with thin skin and you know what?

23:52.244 --> 23:55.915
They convinced me that I was and nothing was the same for me.

23:55.916 --> 23:59.126
Like I had done something wrong and everybody wanted me to know it.

23:59.127 --> 24:02.798
You didn't do anything wrong.

24:02.799 --> 24:04.841
So when he came back, everybody acted like it was normal.

24:04.842 --> 24:08.428
"Hey, Troy. How's the going, Troy? Have you eaten, Troy?"

24:08.429 --> 24:12.683
The only person I could talk to about it was my daughter

24:12.684 --> 24:14.852
and she didn't even know what was going on. So you want to respect me?

24:14.853 --> 24:18.355
When I turn Troy in to the police and he comes back and kills me,

24:18.356 --> 24:21.149
will your respect-save me?

24:21.150 --> 24:23.319
What good will your respect do me?

24:23.320 --> 24:25.279
What good is anything in this fucked up world?

24:25.280 --> 24:27.825
Here's your casserole dish. I tried to wash it, but it just crusted up all over.

24:27.826 --> 24:32.505
You just have to let it soak overnight in hot water.

24:34.416 --> 24:35.717
This isn't even mine.

24:38.754 --> 24:40.576
-Has anybody heard from dad at all? -No.

24:42.591 --> 24:45.311
Any ideas where he might be?

24:45.970 --> 24:47.872
Most likely in the Philippines, gambling.

24:49.140 --> 24:52.810
Ugh, dad made his bet I guess.

24:52.811 --> 24:55.594
-Slow down, Declan, my knees. -What's happening with your knees?

24:58.275 --> 25:00.244
Mom, what's going on with your knees?

25:02.947 --> 25:05.866
I heard you. My hearing is fine.

25:05.867 --> 25:08.890
-Okay, so what's wrong with your knees? -Oh, where's the bitter melon.

25:09.203 --> 25:13.507
Oh, mom.

25:14.793 --> 25:17.046
I know, it's the end of the season, but it might still be good.

25:17.047 --> 25:19.547
-Bitter melon is never good. -I need it for my high blood pressure.

25:19.548 --> 25:23.810
Besides, you should probably go to an Asian market for bitter melon.

25:24.636 --> 25:26.615
This farmer's market got pretty gentrified.

25:26.616 --> 25:27.890
What word is that, Declan?

25:27.891 --> 25:28.949
What? Gentrified?

25:28.950 --> 25:32.070
Yes, your Auntie Divi uses that on Facebook.

25:32.144 --> 25:35.615
Um...

25:36.149 --> 25:38.368
Okay, gentrification is when you try to turn an old neighborhood

25:38.652 --> 25:44.292
into a new neighborhood by bringing in newer people with more money.

25:45.076 --> 25:49.747
- Like here in The Mission. - Exactly.

25:49.748 --> 25:52.675
The Filipinos really gentrified The Mission.

25:53.543 --> 25:56.003
What? No, no, no. You're not getting it.

25:56.004 --> 25:57.880
No, because when your Lolo and Lola first moved here,

25:57.881 --> 26:02.052
it was an Irish neighborhood.

26:02.053 --> 26:04.303
Your Lola had a coworker, Irish woman

26:04.304 --> 26:07.224
and she always said, "This is not The Mission anymore."

26:07.225 --> 26:11.363
And now she's dead.

26:11.395 --> 26:12.823
Huh.

26:16.610 --> 26:19.865
Boom bitch. Sent your immigrant ass back to where

26:19.866 --> 26:22.991
it came from.-[laughs] -All right, all right.

26:22.992 --> 26:26.244
Let me pick a different character.

26:26.245 --> 26:27.913
Yeah, pick a real character, not some fake ass bitch.

26:27.914 --> 26:31.218
Damn, dude. Oh, hold up.

26:31.835 --> 26:35.222
What's happening, hot stuff?

26:36.297 --> 26:38.684
[laughs] Sweet, see you at 7:00. Late.

26:40.301 --> 26:44.022
-Who was that? -That was Marcus. -Oh.

26:45.058 --> 26:49.895
Yeah, I haven't see the guys in at least 10 years. We're going out tonight.

26:49.896 --> 26:54.942
I was gonna barbecue tonight. I got the meat marinating.

26:54.943 --> 26:57.988
Shit, I didn't know you were barbecuing.

26:57.989 --> 27:00.322
Just bring the guys over. I got plenty of meat for everybody. [laughs]

27:00.323 --> 27:05.129
Yeah, let me see what their plans are.

27:09.584 --> 27:13.880
- Call him. - What?

27:13.881 --> 27:16.558
- Call Marcus. - Oh, um, he's busy.

27:17.009 --> 27:22.190
- I'll call him later. - All right, text him.

27:22.849 --> 27:25.026
Dude, don't be weird. [laughs]

27:27.352 --> 27:30.689
I'm gonna hang out with the guys and I'll see if we can come back here later.

27:30.690 --> 27:33.650
All right?

27:33.651 --> 27:34.953
Who's ready for barbecue?

27:38.032 --> 27:40.735
I've been meaning to tell you, I'm not going to be here, Mom.

27:41.368 --> 27:44.913
- Where are you going? - Out with friends.

27:44.914 --> 27:47.833
But Troy is going to barbecue.

27:47.834 --> 27:51.086
Mom, I love you, but when I come to San Francisco, I'm not just visiting family.

27:51.087 --> 27:56.143
Hmpf. Well, you're here for dinner, Dec?

27:56.635 --> 28:00.563
I'm going out with friends, too.

28:01.264 --> 28:05.018
- Friends? - Yeah.

28:05.019 --> 28:08.240
I thought you said you didn't have any friends left in San Francisco, Dec.

28:08.481 --> 28:11.868
That's why you left.

28:12.778 --> 28:15.330
- No, I have friends here, still. - Who?

28:17.658 --> 28:19.626
You don't know them.

28:23.831 --> 28:28.418
Fine, make your own fucking dinners then.

28:28.419 --> 28:31.515
And get the fuck out of my life.

28:47.732 --> 28:52.111
Hey, Shelly. It's Tiva.

28:52.112 --> 28:54.123
Look, I'm really sorry about earlier today.

28:54.656 --> 28:57.741
I intended to offer you support and instead I said something that pissed you off

28:57.742 --> 29:01.955
and I'm so sorry about that.

29:01.956 --> 29:04.419
I really hope you know that was not my intention at all

29:05.167 --> 29:07.962
and I would never force you to do anything that you wouldn't wanna do.

29:07.963 --> 29:12.049
All I want you to know is that I'm a safe space, okay?

29:12.050 --> 29:15.354
So, uh, I really don't know how to end these messages.

29:16.430 --> 29:19.691
That wasn't my mom's casserole dish.

29:20.935 --> 29:23.070
I'll talk to you later.

29:23.688 --> 29:25.364
[clock ticking]

29:27.358 --> 29:29.860
This place is nice.

29:29.861 --> 29:32.571
Yeah, it's pretty nice, huh? Homey.

29:32.572 --> 29:36.159
Homey, yeah.

29:36.160 --> 29:38.411
I mean the dark wood is a little oppressive, but...

29:38.412 --> 29:40.621
I have to say, I was pretty surprised to hear from you.

29:40.622 --> 29:44.209
I mean, I thought you pretty much cut off all ties with everyone.

29:44.210 --> 29:47.671
Yeah, I don't know, I just felt like it's Christmas, you know?

29:47.672 --> 29:51.967
I wanted to see people.

29:51.968 --> 29:53.811
- Hey, you guys. - Here's Johnny.

29:56.348 --> 30:00.143
- It's showtime. - Just get in the car, man.

30:00.144 --> 30:02.896
Oh, man. I wanted to do my Scar Face quote.

30:02.897 --> 30:05.106
What? "Say hello to my little friend"? That doesn't even fit in here.

30:05.107 --> 30:08.777
- What up, ninja? - Lisa.

30:08.778 --> 30:12.457
Oh, shit. Is that Troy?

30:13.033 --> 30:15.785
-[Lisa] Oh, that's some horror movie shit. -Fuck.

30:15.786 --> 30:19.413
He's been calling me nonstop and wants to hang out and shit.

30:19.414 --> 30:21.917
So, have you guys been hanging out?

30:21.918 --> 30:24.845
[laughter]

31:02.711 --> 31:07.549
- So, are you still like that? - Like what?

31:07.550 --> 31:09.927
- Self-hating. - I was never self-hating.

31:09.928 --> 31:12.555
You hate effeminate men.

31:12.556 --> 31:14.974
First of all, that is a flat out lie. Second, I dated you, didn't I?

31:14.975 --> 31:19.229
Yeah, until you didn't.

31:19.230 --> 31:21.356
I love effeminate men.

31:21.357 --> 31:23.608
It's not the femininity that I hate,

31:23.609 --> 31:25.735
it's this kind of adopted persona that comes with gay pride. You know?

31:25.736 --> 31:30.408
-No, educate me. Fill me with your wisdom. -See, that right there.

31:30.409 --> 31:32.184
If anybody has a differing opinion, you make

31:32.185 --> 31:34.337
it sound like that person is an erudite snob.

31:34.788 --> 31:38.958
An erudite snob?

31:38.959 --> 31:41.179
-Yeah, I'm still there. -Still there? -Yeah.

31:43.298 --> 31:45.841
Dude, how can you afford to be living in the same neighborhood if you have no job?

31:45.842 --> 31:49.261
-Well, I mean I live with my parents. -Cool.

31:49.262 --> 31:52.556
- So Declan's gay, huh? - Yeah, crazy, huh?

31:52.557 --> 31:55.476
- Uh, is he all faggy now? - No, he's the same old Declan.

31:55.477 --> 31:58.855
-Can I call him "Dicklan" now? [laughter] -Humor.

31:58.856 --> 32:03.943
Yo, Moe. Tell Lisa about that video we did about how to talk with a Filipino accent.

32:03.944 --> 32:08.157
- Oh, shit. That's rad. - I probably still have that.

32:08.158 --> 32:10.242
What? Dude, you need to upload it.

32:10.243 --> 32:12.286
Seriously, that shit could go viral.

32:12.287 --> 32:14.372
Moe, do you still have that video we took of Benjie

32:14.373 --> 32:16.624
pissing on the electric fence?

32:16.625 --> 32:18.251
Oh, god. I had criminal taste in men.

32:18.252 --> 32:20.879
Fuck yeah, you did.

32:20.880 --> 32:22.756
Moe, I hope you don't have any videos of that.

32:22.757 --> 32:25.175
You know? Actually, I do.

32:25.176 --> 32:27.345
[laughter]

32:27.346 --> 32:29.096
I saved all that shit.

32:29.097 --> 32:31.015
You have to send those to us. That was some funny shit, man.

32:31.016 --> 32:35.311
Yeah, Benjie was like fucking crying like a little girl.

32:35.312 --> 32:39.690
No offense. [laughs]

32:39.691 --> 32:41.485
What? I'm not offended. I'm not a little girl.

32:41.486 --> 32:43.611
[laughter]

32:43.612 --> 32:45.781
All I'm saying is that when I worked in The Castro,

32:45.782 --> 32:48.575
I met a ton of effeminate men who were sweet,

32:48.576 --> 32:52.163
compassionate, lovely, sexy people,

32:52.164 --> 32:55.458
and then years down the road, they become catty, mean, misogynous, racist, you know.

32:55.459 --> 32:59.346
Okay, I hear you. So, look, the gay community may not be perfect, but it's all we have.

33:00.756 --> 33:05.886
I mean, all I've ever wanted my entire life is to belong

33:05.887 --> 33:10.683
and when I moved to San Francisco, I felt like I did.

33:10.684 --> 33:14.229
Okay, and all I'm saying is that as a native San Franciscan, I never experienced racism

33:14.230 --> 33:18.607
until I came out of the closet. So there's that.

33:18.608 --> 33:23.038
For all the talk of equality and getting rid of hate speech and eradicating stereotypes,

33:23.155 --> 33:28.369
the gay community has an awesome way of making people of color

33:28.370 --> 33:31.455
feel like they're second class citizens.

33:31.456 --> 33:33.457
And if anyone tries to call out their racism,

33:33.458 --> 33:36.627
"Girl, relax. It's a fucking joke."

33:36.628 --> 33:40.266
Okay, and are you saying none of that exists in New York?

33:40.550 --> 33:43.812
I don't know.

33:44.721 --> 33:46.943
- Fundamental differences. - What are you saying?

33:47.265 --> 33:50.171
Isn't that what you said when you dumped me?

33:50.172 --> 33:51.561
I did not say that.

33:51.562 --> 33:54.272
- Yeah, you did. - I wouldn't.

33:54.273 --> 33:56.232
I mean it sounds like something I would say, but...

33:56.233 --> 33:58.569
Okay, well, I may not be quoting you verbatim or whatever,

33:58.570 --> 34:01.112
but you pretty much made that sentiment clear.

34:01.113 --> 34:04.083
Why is it so hard for you to accept

34:05.577 --> 34:08.463
the fact that not everybody thinks or lives like you do?

34:09.205 --> 34:11.708
- That's a fair question. - I need to find the bathroom.

34:14.253 --> 34:18.139
- I'm sorry. - Can't you just be normal?

34:19.342 --> 34:20.893
Normal.

34:23.388 --> 34:25.222
[theatrical music]

34:25.223 --> 34:28.400
[phone vibrates]

34:41.074 --> 34:45.827
[Lisa] So, how the fuck are you, Moe?

34:45.828 --> 34:47.704
[Moe] Kinda good. I mean, good.

34:47.705 --> 34:50.873
Yeah. Philly, right?

34:50.875 --> 34:52.668
Yeah, Philly. Lived there for almost, uh, 10 years.

34:52.668 --> 34:56.422
- Married? - Yeah. Yeah, I'm married.

34:56.422 --> 34:59.759
Mm, not me.

34:59.760 --> 35:03.347
I can't even imagine being married. That's some adulting right there.

35:03.348 --> 35:06.902
Lisa, you do know that I've been drug free for over 10 years, right?

35:08.895 --> 35:13.899
I'm not ready to act my age yet. Do you act your age?

35:13.900 --> 35:16.611
[chuckles]

35:16.612 --> 35:17.987
You know what? I don't know.

35:17.988 --> 35:20.865
I mean it's like I turned 25 and... and then I had a birthday party

35:20.866 --> 35:25.538
and everyone's all like, "Surprise, you're 40."

35:25.539 --> 35:28.667
I look at my mom and then... You know she's retiring soon?

35:28.668 --> 35:30.010
Mm hmm.

35:30.752 --> 35:34.755
My mom comes to Philly once a year to visit, right?

35:34.756 --> 35:37.676
I'll probably see my mom 10 more times.

35:37.677 --> 35:40.595
That's sobering.

35:40.596 --> 35:43.339
And I just wanna look back at all the things I have in my life

35:44.350 --> 35:48.321
and see all this adds up, but I can't.

35:48.855 --> 35:53.109
You know? Not yet.

35:53.110 --> 35:56.121
Then, when? When will it all add up?

35:57.072 --> 36:00.783
That's just it. I don't know.

36:00.784 --> 36:03.786
Hmm.

36:03.787 --> 36:06.008
Okay, so, Moe, you know I love you

36:08.001 --> 36:11.848
and I've always been one of the guys, right?

36:11.849 --> 36:13.131
Mm hmm.

36:13.132 --> 36:16.509
It's a thing. Like I'm a thing.

36:16.510 --> 36:18.470
I'm one of those women that's always been one of the guys

36:18.471 --> 36:21.474
and has trouble making female friends, so I understand men.

36:21.475 --> 36:25.186
Like, I do, but I have to say,

36:25.187 --> 36:28.281
what you're going through right now is some male shit.

36:28.899 --> 36:33.570
Seriously, I'm not one to call myself feminist, like, but I gotta be honest.

36:33.571 --> 36:38.241
I've had so many of my male friends tell me how they don't know where the time went,

36:38.242 --> 36:42.037
what they've done with their lives, how their kids got so big without them knowing

36:42.038 --> 36:45.957
and I'm always like, what have you done with your lives?

36:45.958 --> 36:48.877
Well, your mom who you've been living with, she knows. Ask her.

36:48.878 --> 36:54.509
What have you done with your life? Ask your wife, she's been there at your side.

36:54.510 --> 36:58.430
How did your kids get so big without you knowing?

36:58.431 --> 37:00.432
I'll tell you how, their mother raised them. See?

37:00.433 --> 37:03.727
Women don't go through this kind of mid-life crisis because they're too fucking busy

37:03.728 --> 37:06.689
- getting shit done. - Hmm.

37:06.690 --> 37:08.525
Men feel like there's this legacy they have to leave behind

37:08.526 --> 37:12.955
as if the future gives a shit about Marcus and Lionel over there.

37:14.114 --> 37:17.292
Do you know how many civilizations

37:18.787 --> 37:20.954
have had their whole history swept away by some cataclysm?

37:20.955 --> 37:24.500
I wonder how many men thought that their recorded histories were so damn important

37:24.501 --> 37:28.504
that they needed to preserve them.

37:28.505 --> 37:31.208
You think those videos you uploaded from your camera are safe?

37:31.925 --> 37:36.272
Your computer isn't safe. Your hard drive isn't safe.

37:37.431 --> 37:41.277
The Cloud isn't safe.

37:41.770 --> 37:44.656
And you think everything is forever.

37:45.732 --> 37:48.160
It's not.

37:48.694 --> 37:50.412
All we have is now.

37:50.904 --> 37:53.239
All we have is us.

37:53.240 --> 37:55.302
And until we get wiped away as a civilization

37:56.536 --> 38:00.464
and all our records and proof of existence are obliterated,

38:01.749 --> 38:06.211
all we have left are the men

38:06.212 --> 38:09.006
who fear not leaving a mark in this world

38:09.007 --> 38:12.937
and the women who actually run it.

38:14.555 --> 38:16.481
Of course, that's not my style.

38:19.101 --> 38:21.854
I'm just one of the guys.

38:21.855 --> 38:23.865
[clock ticking]

38:53.430 --> 38:57.809
- Matias? - Yeah, Declan?

38:57.810 --> 39:01.021
- That's me. - Nice to meet you.

39:01.022 --> 39:03.282
Nice to meet you.

39:05.527 --> 39:06.828
So...

- Hey, Tiva. What's up? - Hey, I got Moe in my car.

39:25.090 --> 39:28.050
We're thinking of getting a drink. What are you up to?

39:28.051 --> 39:30.887
- Fucking a man. - That's stupid.

39:30.888 --> 39:33.138
NWhatever, I'm coming to get you.

39:33.139 --> 39:35.442
[TV sport commentator]

39:36.394 --> 39:39.864
Troy, are you going to eat more? I'm going to put the food in the fridge.

39:41.483 --> 39:46.529
Yeah, leave it out. I'm gonna have more after this.

39:46.530 --> 39:50.333
Okay, I'll just cover it.

39:52.119 --> 39:56.331
Don't forget to leave enough leftovers for Moe and Declan.

39:56.332 --> 40:00.386
- Fuck them. - I'm going to sleep.

40:01.212 --> 40:04.808
You know, we let them stay here for Christmas

40:06.134 --> 40:08.845
and they don't even have the decency to consider us when they make plans.

40:08.846 --> 40:12.859
- Good night, Anak. -They don't care about family.

40:13.392 --> 40:17.395
To family!

40:17.396 --> 40:20.099
- I can't believe we're all here. - You mean in a sports bar?

40:21.108 --> 40:24.653
[crowd cheering]

40:24.654 --> 40:26.906
That too, but I mean us, in San Francisco.

40:26.907 --> 40:30.994
Then you guys leave.

40:30.995 --> 40:32.746
-I know. -We're not leaving until Tuesday morning.

40:32.747 --> 40:35.331
- What are your plans until then? - Honestly, nothing.

40:35.332 --> 40:37.918
- Yeah, me neither. - Okay, let's do something.

40:37.919 --> 40:40.546
- Yes, let's do something. - Like what?

40:40.547 --> 40:42.423
Whatever you guys want.

40:42.424 --> 40:43.758
I wanna take a trip down memory lane.

40:43.759 --> 40:45.551
You know, Anna's Danish Cookies.

40:45.552 --> 40:48.304
Moe, that place has been closed forever.

40:48.305 --> 40:51.223
- What? - What?

40:51.224 --> 40:52.433
- G-O-D. - Damn.

40:52.434 --> 40:54.436
Well, there must be some other cookies around there.

40:54.437 --> 40:56.521
Oh hell, yeah. I'll take you to some places you haven't been.

40:56.522 --> 40:58.941
We could go for pupusas at that Colombian place.

40:58.942 --> 41:01.027
Oh, at [indistinct].

41:01.028 --> 41:02.235
-Yeah. -Yeah. -Closed.

-What? -What? -Yup.

Well, let's take Moe to that place

41:05.783 --> 41:07.950

- Man, look at all those cranes. - I know, what's up with that?

41:42.656 --> 41:46.325

You would say that, Mr. New York.

41:51.499 --> 41:54.501
That's not even clever, Mr. Not clever.

41:54.502 --> 41:57.212
[laughter]

41:57.213 --> 41:59.755
Hey, hey, have you guys ever, uh, had Filipino cocktails?

42:00.258 --> 42:04.470
Yeah, there's a place in Manhattan that makes a cocktail with Tang.

42:04.471 --> 42:08.683
- Oh, you mean Tang? - Yeah, Tang.

42:08.684 --> 42:11.144
What do they call that,Tang Ina?

42:11.145 --> 42:13.105
[laughs]

42:13.106 --> 42:14.147
It's stupid. [laughter]

42:14.148 --> 42:15.482
It's stupid. [laughs]

42:15.483 --> 42:17.526
- You know what we're gonna do? - What?

42:17.527 --> 42:19.194
We're gonna have, uh, Filipino food.

42:19.195 --> 42:21.114
We're gonna go to Pampalasa for Kamayan.

42:21.115 --> 42:24.042
- What? - What is that?

42:24.242 --> 42:27.463
[music]

42:28.288 --> 42:31.031
- [Shelly] What are you doing? - Just listening to some music.

42:32.001 --> 42:35.796
- It's dark in here. - Leave the light off.

42:35.797 --> 42:39.058
-Why? -Remember how this used to be our song?

42:39.383 --> 42:44.597
- It still is our song, right? - It was our first slow dance.

42:44.598 --> 42:48.986
-I'm gonna put the groceries away. -What... what did you do today?

42:49.687 --> 42:53.908
Well, I went to work to see if I could get extra hours, and then I went shopping.

42:54.525 --> 42:58.445
- For what? - For these, the groceries.

42:58.446 --> 43:01.741
So you stopped by work? Did you get the extra hours?

43:01.742 --> 43:05.828
No, they went to someone else.

43:05.829 --> 43:08.332
So that couldn't have taken more than 30 minutes, right?

43:08.373 --> 43:11.510
- Well... - It didn't.

43:12.712 --> 43:14.880
And then you went grocery shopping and you're only coming home now.

43:14.881 --> 43:19.269
-Yeah. -And what time did you leave this morning?

43:20.887 --> 43:23.857
I don't remember.

43:25.100 --> 43:27.282
Where was the first place you went this morning?

43:28.062 --> 43:31.366
- I don't remember. - Are you sure?

43:54.507 --> 43:56.850
- Mom! - Mina, close that fucking door.

43:58.302 --> 44:00.470
I swear to God. What the fuck would you do without me?

44:00.471 --> 44:04.734
- What are you doing? - Shh. Stay here, Anak.

44:05.435 --> 44:08.021
- You'll be safe here. Shh. - Call the police.

44:08.022 --> 44:10.095
[Troy] What the fuck are you gonna do without me, huh?

44:10.096 --> 44:11.086
[Shelly cries]

44:11.483 --> 44:14.611
-What the fuck are you gonna do without me? -Troy, easy, man.

44:14.612 --> 44:17.322
- Fuck you, Moe. - That's enough.

44:17.323 --> 44:19.950
- You hittin' Shelly, man? - Mind your own business, Moe.

44:19.951 --> 44:23.121
- [Shelly cries] - Shelly, are you okay?

44:23.122 --> 44:26.331
Shelly, do you need a hospital?

44:26.332 --> 44:27.833
I can call Tiva and have her come right back.

44:27.834 --> 44:28.334
No, no.

44:28.335 --> 44:30.586
Seriously, she's probably just around the corner.

44:30.587 --> 44:32.256
- I can have her come back. - Don't call her.

44:32.257 --> 44:33.715
- Mom. - Shh, it's all right, Mina.

44:33.716 --> 44:35.759
Want me to get you a hotel? Shelly, I can do it right now.

44:35.760 --> 44:38.637
It's fine, Declan. Thank you.

44:38.638 --> 44:40.723
Shelly, you can stay in my room tonight. I'll sleep on the couch.

44:40.724 --> 44:45.020
Why didn't you just call the police?

44:45.021 --> 44:47.022
Mina, do you really want to lose your father?

44:47.023 --> 44:50.159
Think of what you're asking for.

44:50.776 --> 44:52.986
Shelly, I won't call Tiva,

44:52.987 --> 44:54.863
but we can take the car if you want to go to the hospital.

44:54.864 --> 44:57.283
- It's fine, Moe, thank you. - Mom, you need ice for your lip.

44:57.284 --> 45:01.162
I'm fine, Mina.

45:01.163 --> 45:02.747
- Come on. Come on, take my room. - Thank you, ma.

45:02.748 --> 45:06.209
Mom, can I sleep in your room? I don't wanna be alone tonight.

45:06.210 --> 45:10.056
Of course, you can, sweetie.

45:13.009 --> 45:17.356
[sighs]

45:18.514 --> 45:20.400
- You guys, go to sleep now. - What's going to happen now?

45:20.683 --> 45:24.821
You're going to sleep now. That's what's going to happen.

45:25.814 --> 45:28.983
Come on.

45:28.984 --> 45:31.070
- All right. - Yeah, let's go to bed.

45:31.071 --> 45:34.281
- Mom, are you all right? - I'm fine.

45:34.282 --> 45:36.825
I just need to sleep. I'll see you in the morning.

45:36.826 --> 45:39.119
Mom, why don't you sleep in my room? I'll take the couch.

45:39.120 --> 45:41.038
No, no, no. I'm okay,Anak.

45:41.039 --> 45:43.208
Come on, why don't you get situated?

45:43.209 --> 45:45.709
Yeah, okay. Night, mom.

45:45.710 --> 45:48.598
- Night, mom. - Good night, guys.

47:26.570 --> 47:27.987
Good morning.

47:27.988 --> 47:29.864
Fuckin' bitch, man. Check this shit out.

47:29.865 --> 47:32.743
Tiva forced Shelly to talk to her yesterday about "domestic abuse".

47:32.744 --> 47:36.747
[laughs]

47:36.748 --> 47:38.458
Tiva and her mom are so nosy.

47:38.459 --> 47:41.085
Always trying to save the world and shit. Save the rainforest.

So you guys are cool now?

47:49.220 --> 47:51.554
I don't know. Are we cool, babe?

47:51.555 --> 47:54.599
- Yeah, we're cool. - Just like that, huh?

47:54.600 --> 47:58.739
No, not just like that. We had awesome make up sex.

47:58.897 --> 48:03.276
- Pig. [laughs] - Pig?

48:03.277 --> 48:06.455
- Ow, careful. - What about Tiva?

48:07.240 --> 48:10.493
She's just meddling in other people's business just like her mom.

48:10.494 --> 48:13.329
Fuckin' bitch made me hurt Shelly.

48:13.330 --> 48:15.664
Don't worry, though. She's getting what's coming to her.

48:15.665 --> 48:18.084
If I ever see her in the street, she's dead.

48:18.085 --> 48:21.504
Like I always say, I may have two strikes against me,

48:21.505 --> 48:25.091
but if I'm gonna break the law for my third strike, I'm gonna make it count.

48:25.092 --> 48:28.803
Okay, guys. I'm going to McDonald's to get breakfast.

48:28.804 --> 48:32.224
Stop it. [laughing]

[somber music]

48:37.897 --> 48:41.150
- [Declan] Mom? - What?

48:41.151 --> 48:44.121
Why do you keep Troy in the house?

48:45.489 --> 48:47.916
What do you mean?

48:50.287 --> 48:53.051
I mean, if he's so bad, why do you keep him in the house? Believe me,

48:53.052 --> 48:56.273
Declan. If it weren't for Mina, I would have kicked him out of the house.

48:57.127 --> 49:01.256
Oh, really?

49:01.257 --> 49:03.466
Don't give me that, "Oh really?" Of course, I would.

49:03.467 --> 49:07.345
And why would you kick him out of the house?

49:07.346 --> 49:09.723
Because he's mean. He's violent and he scares everybody.

49:09.724 --> 49:14.069
But Mina's stopping you from kicking him out?

49:14.645 --> 49:17.699
No, she's not stopping me, but she needs a dad.

49:18.775 --> 49:22.120
I didn't have a dad and look at how well I turned out.

49:27.035 --> 49:30.212
- And I feel so guilty. - About what?

49:35.001 --> 49:39.213
- Guilty about what, mom? - I don't know.

49:39.214 --> 49:42.425
Stop asking. [sighs]

49:42.426 --> 49:46.271
- Does anybody like him? - No, everybody's scared of him.

49:48.350 --> 49:52.111
- Even his own daughter. - Yeah.

49:53.605 --> 49:56.742
You don't like him either.

49:58.026 --> 49:59.818
Declan, why do you keep on asking all of these things?

49:59.819 --> 50:03.739
Mom, you can love someone and not like them.

50:03.740 --> 50:06.502
Yeah, okay. I don't like your brother.

50:07.995 --> 50:12.049
Is there anything Troy can do to make people's lives better?

50:13.000 --> 50:17.597
No. He makes everybody's life worse.

50:25.515 --> 50:30.268
So, as he makes everyone's life worse

50:30.269 --> 50:33.406
and nobody will miss him,

50:34.315 --> 50:36.578
and the world would be a better place without him.

50:40.197 --> 50:44.576
Why don't we kill Troy?

50:44.577 --> 50:46.587
[laughs] Declan, that's sick.

50:51.918 --> 50:56.097
How would we do it?

It's just really intense around here, Julie. I haven't had time to bring it up.

51:06.475 --> 51:10.354
What happened?

51:10.355 --> 51:12.772
Julie, look, I'll tell you when I get back.

51:12.773 --> 51:16.110
I'm always scared somebody can hear me.

51:16.111 --> 51:18.413
Okay. How are you holding up?

51:18.780 --> 51:21.917
Julie, you ever think that everyone ends up just like their parents?

Okay. I have to go.

Okay. Hey Julie?

55:50.241 --> 55:54.620
I talk to Prisca about it.

55:54.621 --> 55:56.664
- You talk to my mom about it? - Of course I do.

55:56.665 --> 55:58.833
- Psh, unbelievable. - I talk to Mina about it.

55:58.834 --> 56:02.628
You're both backstabbing bitches.

56:02.629 --> 56:04.673
Mina talks to me about it. What do you expect me to do?

56:04.674 --> 56:07.384
You pretend that you're on my side and you talk shit about me behind my back?

56:07.385 --> 56:10.013
-You'd hit me! -Fucking traitors. You're fucking traitors!

56:10.014 --> 56:11.931
No, I'm the fucking traitor!

56:11.932 --> 56:14.017
Stop it, Troy! This is not your house.

56:14.018 --> 56:18.228
This is my house.

56:18.229 --> 56:20.449
You haven't had a job for years

56:20.983 --> 56:23.861
and what do you plan to do when I retire, huh?

56:23.862 --> 56:26.664
So, when you say we are disrespecting you in your own house?

56:28.449 --> 56:33.120
Remember whose house it really is.

56:33.121 --> 56:35.331
Well, if you want to get technical, this isn't your house either.

56:35.332 --> 56:38.417
- It's the landlord's house. - Shut the fuck up.

56:38.418 --> 56:42.506
Make me.

56:42.507 --> 56:44.142
[thud]

56:45.051 --> 56:47.674
You have no idea how many people you've terrorized, do you?

56:48.554 --> 56:51.733
Living with you was hell.

56:52.308 --> 56:54.727
I spent my childhood afraid to say anything against you because you'd hit me.

56:54.728 --> 56:58.856
Fuckin' one time you kicked me in the face because I ate the last piece of chicken.

56:58.857 --> 57:01.331
Why are you bringing that up? We patched that.

57:01.332 --> 57:02.568
We didn't patch shit.

57:02.569 --> 57:07.241
You just started acting like nothing ever happened.

57:07.242 --> 57:09.785
That's how everything gets resolved with you. You never apologize.

57:09.786 --> 57:12.997
-It's why you don't have any friends. -Uh, I do have friends.

57:12.998 --> 57:16.125
- Who are your friends? - Uh, you don't know them.

57:16.126 --> 57:19.128
Who? The parents of the kids at school? They don't like you.

57:19.129 --> 57:22.132
- They are all afraid of you. - I wasn't talking about them.

57:22.133 --> 57:24.259
Your old coworkers? They haven't called since you were fired.

57:24.260 --> 57:27.054
-Who the fuck are you friends, Troy? -Uh, Marcus, Lionel.

57:27.055 --> 57:30.891
Oh, bullshit, Troy. Bullshit!

57:30.892 --> 57:33.686
I hung out with them last night and they told me that they try to avoid you,

57:33.687 --> 57:37.774
because you're drama. You're always drama.

57:37.775 --> 57:40.317
Oh, I'm drama? Look at those guys. -What about them?

57:40.318 --> 57:43.655
Fucking druggies. It's what they are.

57:43.656 --> 57:45.574
[laughs] Oh, my god. You don't get it, do you?

57:45.575 --> 57:49.536
They're not what's wrong with this equation. You're the bad guy here.

57:49.537 --> 57:53.374
Then why did they hang out with me in high school?

57:53.375 --> 57:56.220
They were afraid of you.

57:57.254 --> 58:00.381
Good. I'm glad they were afraid of me.

58:00.382 --> 58:02.935
That's what I wanted.

58:04.012 --> 58:06.096
Maybe I should be proud I was abused more than you, Moe.

58:06.097 --> 58:08.891
Maybe I should just accept the fact that I was abused because I was a disappointment.

58:08.892 --> 58:13.104
I was a child protege who could program computers

58:13.105 --> 58:15.982
and got first place in the spelling bee in the first grade. Smart.

58:15.983 --> 58:20.236
So smart that they had me skip a grade and that's when it all went downhill.

58:20.237 --> 58:24.834
I went from all A's to all F's. I was the disappointment

58:25.326 --> 58:29.830
because mom and dad didn't think that I was living up to my potential.

58:29.831 --> 58:33.760
I'm sorry, Moe. I'm sorry they didn't have as high expectations for you,

58:34.837 --> 58:39.099
but let's face it. You were the dumb one.

58:39.634 --> 58:42.937
Do it, goofy, you goofy ass punk,

58:43.596 --> 58:45.932
corny joke telling motherfucker.

58:45.933 --> 58:47.767
You think that guys didn't talk shit about you?

58:47.768 --> 58:50.019
I got to hear it all. I want you to invite them over and get fucked up.

58:50.020 --> 58:52.897
You passed out and I'd hang out with them.

58:52.898 --> 58:55.150
Oh yeah, you got on their fucking nerves.

58:55.151 --> 58:57.903
Oh, yeah? But why did they hang out with me, then?

58:57.904 --> 59:00.331
- I don't know, man. - You're lying.

59:01.074 --> 59:04.242
They called you Moe-ron.

59:04.243 --> 59:06.286
They fucking hated how you always quoted movies and shit.

59:06.287 --> 59:09.414
Always coming into a party, n"Orale vato. What's happening?"

59:09.415 --> 59:13.335
Come on, man. You didn't think that shit was actually cool, did you?

59:13.336 --> 59:17.840
Not as cool as you being the sixth member of Kai.

59:17.841 --> 59:20.385
[laughs]

59:20.386 --> 59:22.179
Oh, this should be good. Okay, Tiva, what've you got?

59:22.180 --> 59:25.057
What you got to say, you fucking homewrecker?

59:25.058 --> 59:27.810
I asked her one question, Troy. I asked if you hit her.

59:27.811 --> 59:31.982
One question? Bitch, you try to get her to turn me in.

59:31.983 --> 59:35.068
Tell him, Shelly. Tell him I supported your decision no matter what.

59:35.069 --> 59:38.697
What the fuck does it matter anyway?

59:38.698 --> 59:41.283
You all fucked yourselves. What next? You're gonna release me?

59:41.284 --> 59:45.713
How do you know I'm not going to beat the shit out of each of you?

59:46.206 --> 59:48.967
Maybe we're gonna call the police.

59:50.877 --> 59:52.795
[laughs] Yeah, right, and tell them what?

59:52.796 --> 59:55.798
That I attacked you? If I recall, Declan hit me first.

59:55.799 --> 59:59.886
- No, he didn't. - Yes, he did.

59:59.887 --> 1:00:02.055
- No, he didn't. - Yes, I did.

1:00:02.056 --> 1:00:04.891
It doesn't matter. We'll all just say that you attacked first.

1:00:04.892 --> 1:00:08.062
And how are you gonna present me to them?

1:00:08.063 --> 1:00:09.772
Like this? You know this looks bad, right?

1:00:09.773 --> 1:00:12.734
They're not gonna believe you.

1:00:12.735 --> 1:00:14.610
- Moe, fucking, ex-junkie? - Fuck you!

1:00:14.611 --> 1:00:17.071
Shelly, who violated the temporary restraining order

1:00:17.072 --> 1:00:19.657
by letting me back in the house in the first place?

1:00:19.658 --> 1:00:22.077
"Oh, crying wolf again, sweetie? Oh, okay.

1:00:22.078 --> 1:00:26.123
This time it's serious? Oh, we believe you this time."

1:00:26.124 --> 1:00:29.052
-We're not going to call the police. -Yeah.

1:00:29.627 --> 1:00:32.421
- We're gonna kill you. - Yeah.

1:00:32.422 --> 1:00:34.674
-You know we were gonna kill him? -No, I was just playing along.

1:00:34.675 --> 1:00:38.428
-I'm actually pretty shocked right now. -Yeah.

1:00:38.429 --> 1:00:42.150
I'm gonna go to the root of all our pain and kill it.

1:00:43.226 --> 1:00:44.861
- Auntie? - [Prisca moaning]

1:00:47.647 --> 1:00:49.690
- Oh, shit, Auntie Prisca! - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

1:00:49.691 --> 1:00:51.984
- She fainted. - What the fuck is she doing?

1:00:51.985 --> 1:00:54.528
- My mom faints like this too. - What the hell is happening?

1:00:54.529 --> 1:00:57.282
- This is what I do with my mom. - What the fuck is happening?

1:00:57.283 --> 1:01:00.670
[alarm going off]

1:01:01.621 --> 1:01:05.582
She's not moving.

1:01:05.583 --> 1:01:07.751
[alarm continues]

1:01:07.752 --> 1:01:09.763
- Mom! - Mom. Ow.

1:01:12.007 --> 1:01:14.008
- [Troy] Mom! - Can you hear me?

1:01:14.009 --> 1:01:15.927
[Troy] Mom. Mom.

1:01:15.928 --> 1:01:17.387
Yeah. I'm listening, Troy.

1:01:17.388 --> 1:01:20.556
I'm interested, really.

1:01:20.557 --> 1:01:22.694
We need to take her upstairs.

1:01:22.894 --> 1:01:25.116
I just need to sit down. I just need to sit down.

1:01:28.858 --> 1:01:32.037
[Troy] So, my family's been secretly conspiring to kill me.

1:01:35.533 --> 1:01:37.333
You all think I've abused you for so long even

1:01:37.334 --> 1:01:39.357
though I'm the one who was abused the most.

1:01:41.414 --> 1:01:46.584
I'm just tripping off the fact that this is what I always wanted to do to dad.

1:01:46.585 --> 1:01:51.715
Get him in a room and let him know exactly what he did to me.

1:01:51.716 --> 1:01:55.719
I'd tie him up too so he couldn't hit me.

1:01:55.720 --> 1:01:58.932
Funny how you're the one in this position now, huh?

1:01:58.933 --> 1:02:00.851
But you? You never got beat by dad.

1:02:00.852 --> 1:02:03.478
- Now, that's funny. - Why is that funny?

1:02:03.479 --> 1:02:07.108
Because me and Moe got the shit kicked out of us

1:02:07.109 --> 1:02:09.694
and you somehow escaped it.

1:02:09.695 --> 1:02:11.654
- Yeah, but you and Mom beat me. - We did not beat you.

1:02:11.655 --> 1:02:14.490
-Yes, you did. -Okay, but not as bad as dad beat me.

1:02:14.491 --> 1:02:18.828
This is stupid. Now we're competing over who got beat the worst.

1:02:18.829 --> 1:02:22.925
You're right. This is stupid especially since you're just gonna kill me.

1:02:25.587 --> 1:02:28.130
-Look, I just said that. -So, you're not going to kill me?

1:02:30.758 --> 1:02:34.146
Now, hold on.

1:02:35.139 --> 1:02:37.271
I'm just saying there wasn't some consensus in

1:02:37.272 --> 1:02:39.268
the family. I just said that in the moment.

1:02:39.269 --> 1:02:40.810
So, you might kill me?

1:02:40.811 --> 1:02:42.438
Man, you are fucking pussy.

1:02:42.439 --> 1:02:45.774
Shut the fuck up.

1:02:45.775 --> 1:02:47.837
Well, I might as well let you know something.

1:02:50.448 --> 1:02:53.667
- What? - Dad's still around.

1:02:55.453 --> 1:02:58.214
- Yeah, right. - I'm serious.

1:02:59.999 --> 1:03:02.335
- Dad's still around. - Oh, okay.

1:03:02.336 --> 1:03:04.420
Dad's still around. I guess I should untie you now.

1:03:04.421 --> 1:03:06.422
I'm not trying to get you to do anything.

1:03:06.423 --> 1:03:08.632
I figured since this is a big confessional,

1:03:08.633 --> 1:03:11.010
I might as well let you know that dad's still around.

1:03:11.011 --> 1:03:14.565
Driving the same bus, doing the same shit, drinking in the same bars.

1:03:15.266 --> 1:03:18.945
Okay, let's say you're telling the truth and that dad's still a part of your life.

1:03:20.980 --> 1:03:25.993
I'm not saying he's a part of my life. I'm just saying he's still around.

1:03:28.239 --> 1:03:29.748
Okay. Well, whatever.

1:03:32.575 --> 1:03:36.329
Why tell me now?

1:03:36.330 --> 1:03:37.997
Well, I just thought that you should know

1:03:37.998 --> 1:03:41.261
what it's like to have a family hide something from you.

1:03:43.338 --> 1:03:44.931
- Hm, family? - Yeah.

1:03:47.676 --> 1:03:51.100
The whole family knows that dad's still around and they kept it a secret for me?

1:03:51.888 --> 1:03:56.226
Kinda kills, doesn't it?

1:03:56.227 --> 1:03:58.811
You all knew that I was trying to get in contact with him.

1:03:59.605 --> 1:04:02.450
Yeah.

1:04:03.527 --> 1:04:06.112
-Why didn't you guys tell me? -Because dad doesn't want to talk to you.

1:04:06.113 --> 1:04:10.825
What? Why doesn't he wanna talk to me?

1:04:10.826 --> 1:04:14.036
Why does anyone in the family not wanna talk to you?

1:04:14.037 --> 1:04:17.383
What are you saying?

1:04:19.294 --> 1:04:21.336
What are you saying, Troy? Why won't dad talk to me?

1:04:21.337 --> 1:04:24.756
Call me a monster all you want, Declan,

1:04:24.757 --> 1:04:27.093
but I stand by what I told you over a decade ago.

1:04:27.094 --> 1:04:30.272
I'm the only person in this family who actually accepts you being gay.

1:04:33.475 --> 1:04:34.819
Hmm. Do it slower.

1:04:39.857 --> 1:04:42.118
- How's that? - Do it stronger.

1:04:44.362 --> 1:04:47.833
- How's that? - [moaning] Do it better.

1:04:54.373 --> 1:04:59.471
-So, dad's still in San Francisco? -What?

1:04:59.588 --> 1:05:03.767
-My dad is still in San Francisco. -No, Declan.

1:05:04.509 --> 1:05:07.312
Come on, Mom. Troy obviously told him.

1:05:07.971 --> 1:05:10.982
- Wait, what? - Everyone knows.

1:05:11.601 --> 1:05:14.186
- Except me and Mina. - And me.

1:05:14.187 --> 1:05:16.355
- And me. - Mom, come on, give it up.

1:05:16.356 --> 1:05:20.108
This, all of this, this is a dream.

1:05:20.109 --> 1:05:24.572
-Declan, just forget about your dad. -I feel like I'm going crazy.

1:05:24.573 --> 1:05:29.327
You don't need your father. He's gone.

1:05:29.328 --> 1:05:32.205
God, isn't any wonder I suffer from depression?

1:05:32.206 --> 1:05:35.258
-Depression? Depression is for white... -Mom, don't!

1:05:44.886 --> 1:05:49.807
Tiva, this is exactly what I'm talking about.

1:05:49.808 --> 1:05:52.862
Are you seeing this? This is how fucked up my family is.

1:05:53.979 --> 1:05:57.074
Tiva, you're not throwing us under the bus.

1:05:58.776 --> 1:06:01.027
If we're going down, you're coming with us.

1:06:01.028 --> 1:06:03.656
The fuck is that supposed to mean?

1:06:03.657 --> 1:06:05.800
- Dec, I'm so sorry. - Aw! Of course, you knew!

1:06:08.496 --> 1:06:12.132
Fucking two timing bitch.

1:06:12.874 --> 1:06:15.085
- Don't call me a bitch, bitch. - You and your mom.

1:06:15.086 --> 1:06:18.556
A couple of snobby bitches talking about making the world a better place,

1:06:18.840 --> 1:06:24.220
but you don't even know how to fix the problems in your own home,

1:06:24.221 --> 1:06:27.056
the problems in your own head.

1:06:27.057 --> 1:06:28.765
You're fucked up, Tiva! You're all fucked up.

1:06:28.766 --> 1:06:31.519
- That's enough... - Fuck you!

1:06:31.520 --> 1:06:33.229
This entire time he's been in San Francisco?

1:06:33.230 --> 1:06:36.983
Mina's own grandfather, and you kept him a secret?

1:06:36.984 --> 1:06:40.204
-Shelly, it's kinder than you think. -Kinder than you think?

1:06:40.738 --> 1:06:44.366
What can be kind about keeping Mina's grandfather a secret?

1:06:44.367 --> 1:06:47.713
Our dad only comes around every once in a while to ask for money.

1:06:48.330 --> 1:06:51.749
He doesn't want to be a part of our lives.

1:06:51.750 --> 1:06:53.251
He's just a drunk that gambles too much.

1:06:53.252 --> 1:06:55.879
But why would you lie to me and Mina?

1:06:55.880 --> 1:06:57.631
Because he doesn't want to meet you.

1:06:57.632 --> 1:07:00.535
When Troy told him about you, he doesn't want to meet you and Mina.

1:07:01.511 --> 1:07:05.523
So, what am I supposed to say?

1:07:06.016 --> 1:07:07.726
"Hey, Mina, your Lolo is still here,

1:07:07.727 --> 1:07:10.562
but you can't meet him because he doesn't want to meet you."

1:07:10.563 --> 1:07:13.607
-At least it would've been honest. -How dare you?

1:07:13.608 --> 1:07:18.028
I was just looking out for your feelings.

1:07:18.029 --> 1:07:20.363
-I have sacrificed so much for this family! -I know!

Yeah, why?

1:23:04.180 --> 1:23:06.398
- She's pregnant. - Huh?

1:23:08.351 --> 1:23:11.521

1:23:13.232 --> 1:23:14.607
- You'll be a dad, Anak. -Yeah.

1:23:14.608 --> 1:23:17.778
[laughs] I'm so happy for you.

1:23:17.779 --> 1:23:21.113
Dude, why now?

1:23:21.114 --> 1:23:23.700
Couldn't you wait until after we dumped our bags in the lake to tell us?

1:23:23.701 --> 1:23:27.120
I just wanted to tell you just in case something happened to us.

1:23:27.121 --> 1:23:30.082
- Like what? - I don't know.

1:23:30.083 --> 1:23:32.761
This is some fucked up shit here.

1:23:33.420 --> 1:23:35.672
I mean, this is crazy. This is murder!

1:23:35.673 --> 1:23:38.174
Yes, it is. This is murder and you're an accomplice.

1:23:38.175 --> 1:23:41.302
Not me. I didn't kill him.

1:23:41.303 --> 1:23:43.263
You just said that we all created this monster.

1:23:43.264 --> 1:23:46.475
You're his older brother. You knew he was being abused and you did nothing to stop it.

1:23:46.476 --> 1:23:50.896
Whenever he had his small moments of victory, did you help raise him up?

1:23:50.897 --> 1:23:54.400
Whenever he needed carrying, did you help carry him?

1:23:54.401 --> 1:23:57.955

1:24:07.206 --> 1:24:11.252
Me too.

1:24:11.253 --> 1:24:13.963
I wanna tell him that he didn't deserve to be abused by dad.

1:24:13.964 --> 1:24:17.759
-Yeah. -I want to tell him he was talented.

1:24:17.760 --> 1:24:21.847

You can't go back. You wanna fix things?

1:24:26.644 --> 1:24:30.230
You wanna make up for what you've done? This is your brother.

1:24:30.231 --> 1:24:34.162
He needs carrying. For once in your life, carry your brother.
