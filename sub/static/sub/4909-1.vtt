WEBVTT

00:01.008 --> 00:03.136
is the equivalent of the human
central nervous system?

00:03.219 --> 00:06.389
- That was my intention, yes.
- Okay.

00:06.431 --> 00:11.060
Well, you gotta realize
that a nervous system is going to...

00:11.102 --> 00:15.857
radically enhance the way that you feel
and perceive the world around you.

00:15.940 --> 00:20.028
I'm not just talking about hot and cold
and little tiny pinpricks.

00:20.111 --> 00:22.030
Put it this way:

00:23.990 --> 00:26.993
As your experience
becomes varied,

00:27.076 --> 00:31.372
so will the feelings,
emotions, sensations...

00:31.456 --> 00:33.583
stimulated
by that experience.

00:33.666 --> 00:37.879
And while some of these
will be very subtle...

00:37.962 --> 00:41.716
and wonderful
and nuanced and shaded,

00:41.799 --> 00:46.846
others will be profoundly intense
and difficult to tolerate.

00:49.515 --> 00:52.018
Do you feel like
you're ready for that?

00:54.000 --> 01:00.074

contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:01.569 --> 01:03.488
Absolutely.

01:11.746 --> 01:14.332
- Lovely.
- Thank you.

01:14.415 --> 01:16.751
I was referring
to the statue.

01:16.834 --> 01:19.045
I know.

01:21.339 --> 01:23.299
Could you fix
this piece of shit?

01:23.341 --> 01:26.886
I don't know.
Let me take a look.

01:38.106 --> 01:42.610
- Andrew, I'm sure you could
restore this yourself.
- Yes, I could.

01:44.612 --> 01:46.531
But you could do it
much better.

01:50.326 --> 01:52.286
Well, I'd be happy
to fix it for you.

01:52.370 --> 01:55.790
- If it's not too much effort.
- No, not at all.

01:57.875 --> 02:01.546
I've been working all day,
and I could really use some air.
Do you wanna go for a walk?

02:01.629 --> 02:03.881
Oh, that would be
quite splendid. Yes.

02:03.965 --> 02:07.885
- Why are you laughing at me?

02:07.969 --> 02:11.514
You're just-
You're always so polite and so proper.

02:11.556 --> 02:14.142
- It's very sweet.
- Thank you.

02:15.476 --> 02:17.395
Let's go.

02:17.478 --> 02:19.397
Thank you.

02:21.024 --> 02:23.901
When a man's
an empty kettle

02:23.985 --> 02:26.446
He should be
on his mettle

02:26.529 --> 02:29.741
And yet
I'm torn apart

02:29.824 --> 02:34.370
It's because I'm presumin'
that I could be kinda human

02:34.454 --> 02:38.333
If I only
had a heart

02:38.374 --> 02:42.462
- Picture me
- Do you have an impact drill?

02:42.503 --> 02:44.630
- Uh, yeah, over on the rack.
- Thank you.

02:48.509 --> 02:50.595
-Jesus!

02:52.221 --> 02:54.307
There's a party next week...

02:54.390 --> 02:57.101
to celebrate the opening
of the building that I restored,

02:57.143 --> 02:59.562
and all my friends
will be there,

02:59.646 --> 03:01.564
and it would be great
if you could come.

03:01.648 --> 03:04.067
I would love to.
Thank you.

03:05.818 --> 03:08.279
I think
you're letting me win.

03:16.162 --> 03:18.915
Checkmate.

03:23.419 --> 03:28.883
I love all

03:28.925 --> 03:32.595
The many charms

03:32.679 --> 03:37.517
About you

03:37.558 --> 03:40.144
Above all

03:40.228 --> 03:45.441
I want my arms

03:45.525 --> 03:48.611
About you

03:48.695 --> 03:52.156
Don't
Don't be

03:52.240 --> 03:56.869
A naughty, naughty baby

03:56.953 --> 03:58.997
Come to Mama

03:59.080 --> 04:03.459
Come to Mama, do

04:03.543 --> 04:06.212
My sweet

04:06.295 --> 04:11.801
Embraceable

04:12.844 --> 04:16.973
You

04:22.353 --> 04:26.691
Charles, why don't you
go get us a drink?

04:26.774 --> 04:28.985
Sure.

04:29.068 --> 04:33.197
- Thank you. Thank you.

04:35.366 --> 04:40.163
The very thought of you

04:42.957 --> 04:47.920
And I forget to do

04:49.839 --> 04:55.595
The simple
ordinary things

04:55.678 --> 05:01.601
That everyone
ought to do

05:04.062 --> 05:06.898
I'm living in

05:06.981 --> 05:11.319
A kind of daydream

05:12.737 --> 05:17.450
I'm happy as a king

05:17.533 --> 05:20.995
And foolish

05:21.079 --> 05:24.624
Though it may seem

05:24.707 --> 05:29.170
To me you're everything

05:30.672 --> 05:34.509
The mere idea of you

05:37.553 --> 05:42.976
Though I'm here for you

05:44.102 --> 05:47.188
You'll never know

05:47.271 --> 05:50.525
How slow
the moments go

05:50.608 --> 05:56.948
Till I'm near you

05:59.909 --> 06:03.871
- I never understood the phrase
"pearls before swans."

06:03.955 --> 06:05.873
- What?
- Swine.

06:05.957 --> 06:08.626
Oh? Then the ballet is not
Swine Lake?

06:08.710 --> 06:11.754
Oh, God, nobody
makes me laugh like you.

06:11.838 --> 06:14.882
Laughter is essential
for a good friendship.

06:14.966 --> 06:16.884
Yes, it is.

06:20.346 --> 06:23.766
Sometimes I get
the feeling that...

06:24.851 --> 06:28.229
you feel a certain way
about us...

06:28.313 --> 06:31.149
and... that you...

06:31.190 --> 06:33.151
wish or-

06:33.192 --> 06:35.528
- What?

06:35.611 --> 06:39.282
I don't know.
It's just a little-

06:39.324 --> 06:43.244
Having this conversation
with-

06:43.328 --> 06:46.122
- A robot?
- Yes.

06:46.164 --> 06:48.833
I-l mean,
a thing is itself, Andrew.

06:48.916 --> 06:51.919
A tree is a tree,
water is water. You...

06:52.003 --> 06:54.172
are a magnificent machine.

06:54.255 --> 06:58.509
But no matter how much
you change, that's what
you'll always be.

06:58.593 --> 07:03.848
No, I can't believe that,
will not believe that.

07:03.931 --> 07:06.601
I realize I'm not
entirely human.

07:06.643 --> 07:09.395
That's why people don't
always like or understand me.

07:09.437 --> 07:11.439
- I like you.
- You do?

07:11.522 --> 07:15.109
I even understand you...
some of the time.

07:15.193 --> 07:17.403
But l-

07:17.445 --> 07:20.490
I can't invest my emotions
in a machine.

07:25.578 --> 07:27.830
Must be a genetic trait.

07:32.251 --> 07:35.546
Things change, Portia.

07:35.588 --> 07:37.548
Things always change.

07:44.430 --> 07:46.391
She laughed at me.

07:46.432 --> 07:50.645
"A thing is itself, Andrew.
Water is water."

07:50.687 --> 07:54.065
What about ice?
What about steam, hmm?

07:54.148 --> 07:56.818
Andy, you gotta calm down,
okay?

07:56.859 --> 07:59.362
Do you know what it's like
to be laughed at?

07:59.445 --> 08:03.366
Humiliating.
It's an abomination.

08:03.449 --> 08:06.786
Look at me.
Look what I'm doing here.

08:06.828 --> 08:08.788
I am trying to make
something of myself.

08:08.830 --> 08:11.416
I am trying to fulfill my destiny.
Does she notice?

08:11.499 --> 08:13.418
- Andrew?
- Yes?

08:13.501 --> 08:16.004
I don't want you
to take this personally,
but I have to work now.

08:16.087 --> 08:18.006
- Good night.
- Good ni-

08:27.140 --> 08:29.642
Where've you been?
I've been trying to call you.

08:29.684 --> 08:32.602
- Poke me in the eye.
Poke me in the eye, Portia.
- What?

08:32.645 --> 08:34.605
- You're crazy.
- Poke me in the eye!

08:34.647 --> 08:37.734
Ow! Ow!

08:37.817 --> 08:40.570
That hurts. Ow.

08:40.653 --> 08:43.072
- It works.
- What the hell is going on?

08:43.114 --> 08:46.242
It's my neural net. I am the proud owner
of a central nervous system.

08:46.326 --> 08:48.745
- You can feel.
- Oh, yes, very much.

08:48.828 --> 08:50.997
Will you do something
for me?

08:51.080 --> 08:53.750
- Will you perform an experiment
just for the sake of science?
- All right.

08:53.833 --> 08:55.752
Kiss me.

08:57.253 --> 09:00.214
No, not there. Here.

09:08.014 --> 09:09.932
Thank you.

09:10.016 --> 09:12.810
Could you feel it?

09:12.894 --> 09:15.355
It's wonderful.

09:15.396 --> 09:18.107
It's everything
they say it is.

09:19.817 --> 09:21.736
And you?

09:27.825 --> 09:30.078
Portia, what's wrong?

09:31.704 --> 09:34.248
Charles and I are
getting married.

09:41.506 --> 09:43.466
He's a lucky man.

09:43.508 --> 09:46.135
Congratulations
to the both of you.

09:46.219 --> 09:48.388
Goddamn it, Andrew.

09:48.471 --> 09:50.974
- If you're gonna succeed
at this thing-
- What thing?

09:51.057 --> 09:55.228
This thing you're trying to do-
you've got to stop being
so damn deferential.

09:55.311 --> 09:58.898
- I can't help being deferential.
It's built in.
- Then change.

09:58.982 --> 10:01.359
Change?
I have changed.

10:01.442 --> 10:04.779
I don't mean on the outside.
Change on the inside.

10:04.862 --> 10:06.781
- Take chances, make mistakes.
- Mistakes?

10:06.864 --> 10:10.159
Yes! Sometimes it's important
not to be perfect, okay?

10:10.243 --> 10:12.662
- It's important to do the wrong thing.
- Do the wrong thing?

10:12.745 --> 10:16.249
- Yes!
- Why? Oh, I see-
to learn from your mistakes.

10:16.290 --> 10:18.793
No, to make them.

10:18.876 --> 10:22.755
To find out what's real and what's not.
To find out what you feel.

10:22.839 --> 10:25.717
Human beings are
terrible messes, Andrew.

10:25.758 --> 10:29.262
I'll grant you that.
I see.

10:29.345 --> 10:33.349
This is what is known as
an irrational conversation, isn't it?

10:33.433 --> 10:35.476
No, this is
a human conversation.

10:35.560 --> 10:39.230
It's not about being rational.
It's about following your heart.

10:40.356 --> 10:42.275
- And that's what I should do?
- Yes.

10:42.358 --> 10:44.777
And you have a heart,
Andrew. You do.

10:44.861 --> 10:49.615
I feel it. I don't
even believe it sometimes,
but I do feel it.

10:51.617 --> 10:54.037
And in order to follow
that heart,

10:57.457 --> 10:59.375
one must do
the wrong thing.

10:59.459 --> 11:01.377
Yes.

11:06.257 --> 11:08.176
Thank you.

11:42.335 --> 11:47.090
Galatea, Could you be
a little more careful?
That's very delicate equipment.

11:49.968 --> 11:52.804
- Sorry.

11:52.887 --> 11:57.308
- What are you doing?
- Near as I can tell, your bitch work.

11:57.392 --> 11:59.477
My what?

11:59.560 --> 12:02.689
Oh, you heard me,
and I'm sick of it!

12:02.772 --> 12:05.400
All day long it's, "Yes, Rupert, sir,"
" No, Rupert, sir."

12:05.483 --> 12:08.236
"Would you like another beverage,
Rupert, sir?"

12:08.277 --> 12:11.364
And it chaps my ass!

12:11.406 --> 12:13.700
So here's
a helpful hint for you:

12:13.741 --> 12:18.329
Shut up,
and let me do my work!

12:26.212 --> 12:28.631
- No, no.

12:34.429 --> 12:36.389
I'm done.

12:42.353 --> 12:44.814
"Chaps my ass"?

12:53.614 --> 12:55.992
- Give me back the chip.
Where's the chip?
- I replaced it.

12:56.034 --> 13:00.330
Andrew, she's uncooperative,
she's abusive, she's confrontational-

13:00.413 --> 13:02.332
And a lot more interesting,
don't you think?

13:02.415 --> 13:05.335
Arguably, but we're not getting
any work done, Andrew.

13:05.376 --> 13:08.796
Please, please,
give me the old personality chip back.

13:10.089 --> 13:12.967
Fine. She can be perky again.

13:13.051 --> 13:15.595
Perky? She's just a ro-
I didn't mean it that way.

13:15.678 --> 13:20.308
Andrew? Andrew!
I really didn't mean that.

13:20.391 --> 13:24.354
What's the matter with you today?
Andrew, where you going?

13:32.695 --> 13:35.073
Hey, Jamie, come over here.
I want you to meet Charles.

13:35.156 --> 13:37.283
- Charles, my aunt Jamie.
- Hi, nice to meet you.

13:37.367 --> 13:39.285
- This is Ryan.
- Hey, Ryan.

13:39.369 --> 13:41.788
This is Michael.

13:41.871 --> 13:44.415
The boys are great.

13:50.546 --> 13:53.549
- Rupert!
- What's going on?

13:53.633 --> 13:57.470
What's going on?
Portia's parents are throwing
an engagement party...

13:57.512 --> 14:00.264
- that I wasn't invited
to for obvious reasons.
- Yeah.

14:00.348 --> 14:02.517
- There he is.
- Who?

14:02.600 --> 14:04.519
- The prospective groom.
- Where?

14:04.602 --> 14:09.774
Where? The one in the pale blue suit
with the big pointy chin.

14:09.857 --> 14:13.194
- He's got a pointy chin?
- Pointy chin? You could put
an eye out with that chin.

14:13.277 --> 14:16.698
Yeah, that's nothing
compared to his teeth. Look at that.

14:16.781 --> 14:18.700
I'm amazed he's out
in daylight.

14:18.783 --> 14:21.035
He's got
funny teeth, huh?

14:21.119 --> 14:23.538
You need to upgrade
your eyes.

14:23.579 --> 14:26.624
That shouldn't stop Portia.
She can marry who ever she likes.

14:26.708 --> 14:29.544
It's just that one day she's gonna
wake up next to him and realize...

14:29.585 --> 14:34.549
that she is married to a man
whose face closely resembles
an antique can opener.

14:34.590 --> 14:38.052
You know? The kind that used to go-

14:38.094 --> 14:40.555
You know? The ones that move around
and can pops off.

14:40.638 --> 14:44.517
- You're jealous. You are jealous.
- No, I'm not. No, I'm not.

14:44.559 --> 14:49.647
You are. Otherwise what are you
doing sneaking around here,
spying on Portia, huh?

14:49.731 --> 14:52.900
My God, I am jealous.

14:52.984 --> 14:55.486
If I'm jealous,
that means I'm in love.

14:55.528 --> 14:57.697
Hi!
Oh, thanks for coming.

14:57.780 --> 15:01.242
If I'm in love,
then all hope is gone.

15:01.326 --> 15:03.661
I've lost her.

15:03.703 --> 15:05.788
Andrew. Andrew!

15:37.570 --> 15:40.907
Andy, would you like
a sip of my beer?

15:40.948 --> 15:44.369
It would be a waste.
I could not taste it.

15:44.452 --> 15:48.206
- What if you could?
- It would be exquisite.

15:52.168 --> 15:56.255
I've come up with a design-
a modification, rather-

15:56.339 --> 15:59.050
that, if I'm correct,

15:59.133 --> 16:01.636
would enable you to deal
with solid foods and liquids.

16:02.720 --> 16:05.181
- And taste?
- Taste too.

16:07.308 --> 16:10.269
And also,

16:10.353 --> 16:13.356
if my schematics
are correct,

16:13.439 --> 16:15.942
I think I've come up
with a method...

16:16.025 --> 16:17.944
to make you...

16:18.027 --> 16:19.988
a complete man.

16:20.071 --> 16:22.532
Complete?

16:22.573 --> 16:24.534
Complete.

16:32.250 --> 16:34.210
Complete?

16:34.252 --> 16:36.963
Not in a reproductive sense,
of course,

16:37.046 --> 16:40.341
but in terms
of approximating...

16:40.383 --> 16:44.762
the physical sensation,

16:44.846 --> 16:47.223
you know, that occurs-

16:47.307 --> 16:49.517
friction-

16:49.600 --> 16:51.519
- Sexual relations.
- Yeah.

16:53.980 --> 16:57.108
Oh, I've always been
fascinated by that.

16:57.150 --> 16:59.110
Well, I mean, curious...

17:01.070 --> 17:03.114
because-

17:03.156 --> 17:07.452
- Well, because of what they say.
- What do they say?

17:10.204 --> 17:13.290
That you can lose yourself-

17:13.374 --> 17:17.295
everything,
all boundaries, all time-

17:19.547 --> 17:23.050
the two bodies can become
so mixed up...

17:23.134 --> 17:26.887
that you don't know
who's who or what's what.

17:26.929 --> 17:31.309
And just when the sweet
confusion is so intense
you think you're gonna die,

17:31.392 --> 17:33.394
you kind of do,

17:33.436 --> 17:35.605
leaving you alone
in your separate body.

17:35.688 --> 17:38.107
But the one you love
is still there.

17:39.525 --> 17:41.444
That's a miracle.

17:42.654 --> 17:45.698
You can go to heaven
and come back alive.

17:48.242 --> 17:51.996
You can go back
anytime you want-

17:52.080 --> 17:54.040
with the one you love.

17:56.709 --> 17:59.837
- And you want to experience that?
- Oh, yes, please.

18:02.256 --> 18:04.217
So do l.

18:36.165 --> 18:40.211
We'll have to hire more people.
Maybe two more weeks.

18:40.294 --> 18:42.588
Andrew.

18:44.966 --> 18:47.760
- Excuse me. I'll be right back.
- Sure.

18:52.598 --> 18:55.852
- I didn't expect to see you.

18:55.935 --> 18:58.771
I remember this place
very well.

18:58.855 --> 19:01.149
This is where your grandmother
was married.

19:01.232 --> 19:04.277
Yeah, I wanted it ready
for my own wedding.

19:04.360 --> 19:06.195
So, you're not
married yet?

19:06.279 --> 19:08.239
No, two weeks
from Saturday.

19:08.281 --> 19:10.408
I'm not too late.

19:10.491 --> 19:12.910
Are you absolutely positive
you're doing the right thing?

19:12.952 --> 19:15.455
- Positive?
- About getting married?

19:15.538 --> 19:19.208
- I'm never absolutely positive.
- So you could be doing
the wrong thing.

19:19.250 --> 19:21.836
- No, I'm pretty sure
I'm doing the right thing.
- Great.

19:21.919 --> 19:26.049
- Why is that great?
- In your apartment, you told me
to do the wrong thing.

19:26.090 --> 19:28.885
Now, you are not doing the wrong thing.
You're doing the right thing.

19:28.926 --> 19:31.346
It's safe to say you're not
following your own advice,
'cause if you were,

19:31.387 --> 19:33.348
you would definitely not be
marrying this man, Charles.

19:33.389 --> 19:35.725
- Because I would be doing
the right thing.
- Precisely.

19:37.727 --> 19:40.688
In some strange way,
you're starting to make sense.

19:40.730 --> 19:44.108
Good. Do you have any idea what
it's like to be in love with someone...

19:44.192 --> 19:47.153
who's about to marry
someone else?

19:47.195 --> 19:52.325
Someone totally magnificent,
someone who walks into a room
and lights it up like the sun?

19:52.408 --> 19:56.120
Someone who you know
is lying to herself?

19:56.204 --> 19:59.290
- Lying?
- Convincingly, yeah.
Very, very much so.

19:59.374 --> 20:02.335
- About what?
- That you don't love me,

20:02.418 --> 20:04.629
when I know at least
in some way you do.

20:06.673 --> 20:08.758
- And how do you know that?
- Portia,

20:08.841 --> 20:11.135
I have done everything
inside and out.

20:11.219 --> 20:14.597
- But that stuff doesn't matter to me.
- Well, something matters,

20:14.639 --> 20:16.599
'cause I'd have to believe
if nothing mattered, you'd love me...

20:16.641 --> 20:20.019
and not some man
whose chin could sink the Titanic.

20:20.103 --> 20:24.023
- What? See? It's true, isn't it?

20:24.107 --> 20:29.153
I'm sorry.
Does he light you up like this?
Does he make you laugh?

20:30.446 --> 20:32.532
Nobody makes me laugh
like this.

20:32.615 --> 20:35.743
Good. Then admit it.
Admit that you love me.

20:40.540 --> 20:43.418
- Give me one kiss.
- Oh, God.

20:43.501 --> 20:46.170
That's all. One quick kiss.
Just one kiss...

20:46.254 --> 20:49.299
could not jeopardize
a glorious marriage.

20:49.382 --> 20:54.220
Besides, it would also explain
to me why your pulse jumped
from 66 to 1 02 beats per minute.

20:54.262 --> 20:57.557
Your respiration rate has doubled.
You're putting out clouds of pheromones.

20:57.640 --> 21:01.060
- It's not fair to read me like that.
- I know. Love isn't fair.

21:01.102 --> 21:05.773
I'm reading your heart.
I'm asking you to follow it-
begging you.

21:05.857 --> 21:10.028
Begging is supposed to be humiliating.
I don't care.

21:10.069 --> 21:15.533
I love you, Portia.
I loved you the very first
moment I saw you.

21:27.629 --> 21:30.048
- I thought you said a quick kiss.
- I lied.

21:58.910 --> 22:01.079
How do you feel?

22:02.163 --> 22:05.583
- Wonderful.
- So do l.

22:05.625 --> 22:08.086
I guess that's the point.

22:14.133 --> 22:17.845
- What was that?
- That's your stomach growling.
You're hungry.

22:23.768 --> 22:25.728
- Was that me?
- Yes.

22:25.770 --> 22:27.730
- I thought it was you.
- No, it wasn't me.

22:27.772 --> 22:32.193
Really? Ooh. Do you do that?

22:33.778 --> 22:35.738
Sometimes.
Quieter than that.

22:35.822 --> 22:41.327
- Ah. I'll have to have Rupert
make me a muffler.

22:44.831 --> 22:46.749
Mm-hmm.

22:51.379 --> 22:55.842
It's wonderful. It's wonderful-
the taste and the texture both.

22:55.925 --> 23:00.388
You know, it's marvelous.

23:00.471 --> 23:04.600
I know this will be my fourth helping,
but may I please have some more?

23:06.352 --> 23:10.773
Pig- very smart animal.
Obviously not that smart
if it ends up as bacon.

23:10.898 --> 23:14.861
I feel like I'm eating my way
through the entire food chain.

23:14.902 --> 23:17.655
Thank you.

23:23.077 --> 23:24.996
What?

23:26.331 --> 23:28.458
What's wrong?

23:31.085 --> 23:35.298
If we're together-
you and me-

23:35.381 --> 23:37.800
we'll never be accepted.

23:40.053 --> 23:41.971
Because I'm not human.

23:46.100 --> 23:48.019
That will not do.

23:51.856 --> 23:53.775
I will have to get started.

23:53.858 --> 23:55.777
Started with what?

23:57.779 --> 24:00.615
The next step.
I love you.

24:07.246 --> 24:09.707
Wish me luck.

24:28.101 --> 24:31.187
Andrew Martin, step forward, please.

24:40.071 --> 24:44.534
So, Mr. Martin,
you would like us to pass a bill...

24:44.575 --> 24:47.078
declaring you
a human being.

24:47.161 --> 24:50.873
Yes, specifically
the ability to marry...

24:50.957 --> 24:53.501
-a fellow human being.
- I see.

24:53.584 --> 24:56.129
We have to face
the undeniable fact...

24:56.212 --> 24:59.674
that no matter how much
you may be like a human being,

24:59.716 --> 25:02.969
you are not part
of the human gene pool.

25:03.052 --> 25:07.015
You are outside of it entirely.
You are something else,

25:07.098 --> 25:10.101
something artificial.

25:10.143 --> 25:14.772
Sir, what about all the real people
wading in the gene pool...

25:14.856 --> 25:18.234
who have bodies
full of prosthetic devices,
many of which I have invented.

25:18.318 --> 25:22.030
You yourself, sir,
have one of my kidneys, do you not?

25:22.113 --> 25:26.034
Are you not in some way artificial,
at least in part?

25:27.535 --> 25:29.454
In part, yes.

25:29.537 --> 25:32.290
Well, then,
I'm human in part.

25:33.750 --> 25:36.377
Which part, Andrew?

25:36.419 --> 25:39.005
This one, sir.

25:39.088 --> 25:43.426
I see. And here?

25:45.595 --> 25:48.848
It is true I am still equipped
with a positronic brain.

25:48.931 --> 25:51.851
And because of that
positronic brain,

25:51.893 --> 25:55.188
you are,
for all accounts, immortal.

25:57.065 --> 25:59.025
Yes, sir.

26:01.069 --> 26:05.823
Well, Andrew, society can tolerate
an immortal robot,

26:05.907 --> 26:09.285
but we will never tolerate
an immortal human.

26:09.369 --> 26:11.913
It arouses
too much jealousy,

26:11.996 --> 26:13.915
too much anger.

26:13.998 --> 26:19.545
I'm sorry, Andrew.
This court cannot and will not
validate your humanity.

26:20.922 --> 26:23.424
I hereby bring an end
to these proceedings.

26:23.508 --> 26:26.678
It is the decision
of this court...

26:26.761 --> 26:29.681
that Andrew Martin
from this day forward...

26:29.722 --> 26:33.851
will continue
to be declared a robot-

26:33.935 --> 26:38.982
a mechanical machine,
nothing more.

26:42.318 --> 26:44.737
One is glad to be of service.

27:15.310 --> 27:18.563
Andrew, I have to tell you...

27:18.646 --> 27:20.690
I'm beginning to feel
not so sure.

27:20.857 --> 27:24.944
- About us?
- No.

27:26.280 --> 27:30.451
- Next week will be my 75th birthday.
- I know, and you look 50.

27:30.492 --> 27:33.829
- Thank you.
- A spectacular 50.

27:33.871 --> 27:36.790
- But I don't feel 50.
- Your body does.

27:36.832 --> 27:38.792
Last night was amazing.
What was that called again?

27:38.834 --> 27:42.004
- Shut up and listen to me.
- Sorry.

27:42.087 --> 27:45.132
- And don't give me that look.
I'm not ordering you around.
- Whatever you say.

27:45.215 --> 27:48.677
- Please don't be agreeable.
- I'm not being agreeable.
I can be if you want.

27:48.761 --> 27:53.682
Oh, goddamn it, Andrew,
I'm trying to tell you
something important here.

28:00.814 --> 28:03.609
I'm not going
to live forever.

28:03.692 --> 28:06.570
Yes, you will.
That's why I invented-

28:06.612 --> 28:11.200
No, no, I won't always take
your D.N.A. elixirs.

28:11.283 --> 28:14.078
I won't have
all my organs replaced.

28:14.161 --> 28:17.331
Eventually I'm going
to wear out.

28:17.414 --> 28:21.794
- And I want to.
- Why would you want to leave?

28:26.340 --> 28:30.260
There's an...
order to things.

28:30.344 --> 28:35.224
Human beings are meant to be here
for a certain time and then pass on.

28:36.308 --> 28:38.227
That's what's right.

28:39.812 --> 28:42.523
I see.

28:42.606 --> 28:46.443
- There's just one problem, Portia.
- What?

28:46.527 --> 28:49.530
I couldn't stand
to live without you.

29:16.098 --> 29:19.310
Andrew, people grow
through time,

29:19.393 --> 29:22.813
but then, of course, for you time
is a completely different proposition.

29:22.896 --> 29:26.483
For you,
time is endless.

29:37.619 --> 29:40.080
There's only one thing to do.

30:04.813 --> 30:07.399
Galatea, my dear,
where are we?

30:07.483 --> 30:10.361
The transfusion
is almost complete.

30:10.402 --> 30:12.363
Is that so?

30:13.906 --> 30:16.992
Just goes to show you,
Andrew,

30:17.076 --> 30:20.037
somebody becomes
a human being,

30:20.079 --> 30:23.999
sooner or later,
they do something monumentally stupid.

30:24.041 --> 30:27.586
You've been
a great example, Rupert.

30:27.670 --> 30:29.630
How quickly will the blood
degrade my system?

30:29.672 --> 30:32.633
Oh, I don't know.

30:32.675 --> 30:37.304
You exercise, eat right,
I'd say 30, 40 years.

30:39.390 --> 30:41.934
That's a little vague, chief.

30:42.017 --> 30:44.311
You don't know exactly
how long I'll last?

30:44.353 --> 30:46.313
Sorry.

30:48.357 --> 30:50.526
Welcome to
the human condition.

31:00.577 --> 31:03.163
Andrew Martin-

31:15.843 --> 31:19.972
I have always tried
to make sense of things.

31:20.055 --> 31:23.517
There must be some reason
I am as I am.

31:25.978 --> 31:28.397
As you can see,
Madam Chairman,

31:28.480 --> 31:32.401
I am no longer immortal.

31:34.236 --> 31:36.739
You have arranged
to die?

31:36.780 --> 31:40.576
In a sense, I have.

31:40.659 --> 31:45.581
I am growing old,
and my body is deteriorating,

31:46.915 --> 31:49.627
and, like all of you,

31:49.710 --> 31:52.630
it will eventually cease
to function.

31:54.506 --> 31:59.053
As a robot,
I could've lived forever.

32:00.971 --> 32:03.724
But I tell you all today,

32:03.807 --> 32:06.810
I would rather die a man...

32:06.894 --> 32:11.315
than live for all eternity
as a machine.

32:14.318 --> 32:16.278
Why do you want this?

32:18.530 --> 32:20.741
To be acknowledged...

32:20.824 --> 32:24.078
for who and what I am-

32:24.161 --> 32:27.665
no more, no less.

32:27.748 --> 32:31.794
Not for acclaim,
not for approval.

32:31.877 --> 32:35.965
The simple truth
of that recognition-

32:36.048 --> 32:40.386
this has been the elemental drive
of my existence,

32:40.469 --> 32:46.016
and it must be achieved,
if I am to live or die...

32:46.100 --> 32:49.103
with dignity.

32:57.027 --> 32:58.946
Mr. Martin,

33:00.489 --> 33:03.951
what you are
asking for is...

33:04.034 --> 33:07.204
extremely complex
and controversial.

33:07.246 --> 33:10.291
It will not be
an easy decision.

33:10.374 --> 33:13.711
I must ask
for your patience...

33:13.752 --> 33:16.672
while I take the necessary time
to make a determination...

33:16.714 --> 33:21.218
of this extremely
delicate matter.

33:23.387 --> 33:26.348
I await your decision,
Madam Chairman.

33:31.186 --> 33:34.398
Thank you
for your patience.

33:38.110 --> 33:41.322
We tried.

33:54.043 --> 33:56.420
Is it almost time?

33:56.462 --> 33:58.631
In a few minutes.

34:00.466 --> 34:03.260
It doesn't matter
what the World Congress says.

34:03.302 --> 34:07.222
Why do you need
their approval?

34:07.306 --> 34:09.224
Old habit.

34:09.308 --> 34:12.895
I started my existence
as a robot.

34:12.936 --> 34:18.192
I still like to be told
certain things.

34:23.822 --> 34:26.033
It's time.

34:31.246 --> 34:33.916
Ladies and gentlemen,
Ms. Marjorie Bota,

34:33.998 --> 34:36.085
President
of the World Congress.

34:36.168 --> 34:39.254
According to records
of the NorthAm Robotics Company,

34:39.338 --> 34:43.425
the robot,
also known as Andrew Martin,

34:43.509 --> 34:48.389
was powered up at 5:15 p.m.,
on April 3, 2005.

34:49.598 --> 34:53.936
In a few hours,
he will be 200 years old,

34:54.018 --> 34:58.482
which means that,
with the exception of Methuselah
and other biblical figures,

34:58.565 --> 35:04.196
Andrew is the oldest living
human being in recorded history.

35:04.279 --> 35:06.198
For it is
by this proclamation...

35:06.281 --> 35:09.243
that I validate his marriage
to Portia Charney...

35:09.326 --> 35:12.204
and acknowledge his humanity.

35:21.797 --> 35:24.675
Andrew?

35:39.565 --> 35:41.900
I'm sorry
he didn't see it.

35:43.986 --> 35:46.530
Maybe he didn't need to.

35:52.161 --> 35:55.539
Could you do me a favor?

35:57.291 --> 35:59.627
Would you mind
unplugging me?

36:04.632 --> 36:07.092
That's an order.

36:39.750 --> 36:41.710
Thank you, Galatea.

36:43.462 --> 36:46.966
As the great Andrew Martin
used to say,

36:47.049 --> 36:50.219
"One is glad to be of service."

37:08.028 --> 37:11.198
I'll see you soon.

37:37.975 --> 37:42.104
Laugh and cry

37:42.187 --> 37:46.233
Live and die

37:46.317 --> 37:49.445
Life is a dream

37:49.528 --> 37:54.450
We all dream it

37:54.533 --> 37:58.495
Day by day

37:58.537 --> 38:02.791
I find my way

38:02.833 --> 38:06.462
Look for the soul

38:06.545 --> 38:10.507
And the meaning

38:10.591 --> 38:14.595
Then you look at me

38:14.637 --> 38:18.766
And I always see

38:18.849 --> 38:24.772
What I have been
searching for

38:26.940 --> 38:30.653
I'm lost as can be

38:30.736 --> 38:35.115
Then you look at me

38:35.199 --> 38:41.080
And I am not lost anymore

38:48.128 --> 38:52.132
People run

38:52.216 --> 38:56.345
Sun to sun

38:56.428 --> 38:59.390
Caught in their lives

38:59.431 --> 39:04.687
Ever flowing

39:04.728 --> 39:07.773
One sweet dawn

39:07.856 --> 39:12.778
Life goes till it's gone

39:12.861 --> 39:16.407
We have to go

39:16.490 --> 39:20.369
Where it's going

39:20.452 --> 39:24.832
Then you look at me

39:24.873 --> 39:28.836
And I always see

39:28.877 --> 39:34.800
What I have been
searching for

39:37.177 --> 39:40.806
I'm lost as can be

39:40.889 --> 39:45.352
Then you look at me

39:45.436 --> 39:47.813
And I am not lost

39:47.855 --> 39:53.777
Anymore

40:06.165 --> 40:09.752
And you say you see

40:09.835 --> 40:14.506
When you look at me

40:14.590 --> 40:20.471
The reason
you love life so

40:22.514 --> 40:26.018
Though lost I have been

40:26.101 --> 40:30.939
I find love again

40:31.023 --> 40:35.027
And life just keeps
on running

40:35.110 --> 40:39.156
And life just keeps
on running

40:39.239 --> 40:41.200
You look at me

40:41.283 --> 40:46.163
And life holds love for

40:46.205 --> 40:52.044
You

41:00.344 --> 41:06.225
For

41:10.396 --> 41:16.318
You

41:17.305 --> 41:23.677
