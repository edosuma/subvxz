00:01.133 --> 00:05.533
Eldon Chance is a 53-year-old
forensic neuropsychiatrist.

00:05.653 --> 00:07.533
Of late, he is increasingly aware

00:07.534 --> 00:10.657
of a mental state he finds
to be muddied and unstable.

00:10.658 --> 00:12.218
Mrs. Blackstone?

00:12.219 --> 00:14.580
It says here that you separated
from your husband

00:14.581 --> 00:16.382
after he struck you in the face.

00:16.383 --> 00:19.265
Shortly thereafter, you became
aware of a second personality...

00:19.266 --> 00:20.506
Jackie Black.

00:20.507 --> 00:22.629
Jackie is daring and extroverted,

00:22.630 --> 00:24.310
He'll kill me. He said he would.

00:24.311 --> 00:26.192
I could be putting us both in danger.

00:26.193 --> 00:27.558
We're a predatory species.

00:27.559 --> 00:30.356
And next time we coincide
like this, that's on you.

00:30.357 --> 00:31.598
I will not accept

00:31.599 --> 00:33.932
this problem cannot be solved.

00:33.933 --> 00:37.443
This is D. D, meet Dr. Chance.

00:37.444 --> 00:39.045
You want to get down with this cop,

00:39.046 --> 00:40.607
you need to turn the tables on him.

00:40.608 --> 00:41.648
And how would I do that?

00:41.649 --> 00:42.584
You might hire it done.

00:43.570 --> 00:45.331
What you just did
was some kind of audition?

00:45.332 --> 00:46.653
There are no victims.

00:46.654 --> 00:48.294
Right now Blackstone is the feeder,

00:48.295 --> 00:49.455
you're the receiver.

00:49.456 --> 00:50.897
You've got to turn that around.

00:50.898 --> 00:52.578
They've been dating for five months?

00:52.579 --> 00:54.420
I just never thought
I would find out like this.

00:54.421 --> 00:56.502
We don't even know
for sure what this is.

00:56.503 --> 00:58.264
It's this boy's parents telling us

00:58.265 --> 00:59.545
that our daughter is a stalker.

00:59.546 --> 01:00.947
I'm not having trouble.

01:00.948 --> 01:02.228
When he's in love, he's totally in love.

01:02.229 --> 01:03.630
And then, when it's over

01:03.631 --> 01:04.899
and you want to try to still
be friends with him,

01:04.900 --> 01:06.753
that means you're obsessed
and you can't let go.

01:06.754 --> 01:08.554
<i>Hey, Doc. Detective Hynes.</i>

01:08.555 --> 01:11.037
Detective Blackstone stalked and
harassed you and your friend,

01:11.038 --> 01:12.431
and he beat you up.

01:13.360 --> 01:14.881
Stay away from my wife!

01:14.882 --> 01:16.442
Do you really still not see

01:16.443 --> 01:17.724
what dangerous ground this is?

01:17.725 --> 01:19.205
Or is that what you like about it?

01:19.206 --> 01:20.767
He's not omnipotent, Jaclyn.

01:20.768 --> 01:21.808
There are limits.

01:21.809 --> 01:23.169
Not until he's dead.

01:23.170 --> 01:24.290
You're my knight.

01:24.291 --> 01:25.571
Third move in the template.

01:25.572 --> 01:27.293
A single, fatal blow
to the aortic arch...

01:30.217 --> 01:31.909
Dad?

01:32.539 --> 01:33.940
Dad?

01:33.941 --> 01:36.743
We're gonna fix what's wrong with us.

01:36.744 --> 01:38.415
The both of us.

01:39.106 --> 01:40.787
That's what matters.

01:40.788 --> 01:42.829
So now he's gone... Blackstone.

01:42.830 --> 01:45.471
You were there, on the scene.

01:45.472 --> 01:46.993
What are the odds?

01:46.994 --> 01:51.638
A man who wanted me dead
now is dead because of me.

01:51.639 --> 01:52.919
I can't take that lightly.

01:52.920 --> 01:54.761
So, what happens now?

01:54.762 --> 01:56.266
Welcome to the neighborhood.

02:52.379 --> 02:54.449
- Morning.
- Morning.

02:55.142 --> 02:56.863
- Good morning.
- Hey.

03:04.792 --> 03:06.587
Roses have thorns.

03:07.394 --> 03:09.339
I don't know if lilies do.

03:10.117 --> 03:11.598
Well, that's how they're different.

03:11.599 --> 03:13.635
Can you tell me how they're alike?

03:19.366 --> 03:21.018
Same color.

03:24.531 --> 03:26.332
Dog and a cat.

03:26.333 --> 03:28.134
They have tails.

03:28.135 --> 03:29.776
They go fast.

03:31.498 --> 03:35.101
Imagine that you are
a thousand miles from home

03:35.102 --> 03:37.223
and you only got
one dollar in your pocket.

03:37.224 --> 03:38.865
What would you do?

03:38.866 --> 03:40.867
- Where?
- Doesn't matter.

03:40.868 --> 03:43.750
I might know someone who lives
in that place, though.

03:43.751 --> 03:46.392
Imagine, for the purposes
of this question,

03:46.393 --> 03:47.834
that you don't.

03:47.835 --> 03:49.463
I would ask somebody.

03:49.917 --> 03:51.381
What would you ask?

03:52.519 --> 03:54.217
What to do.

03:56.043 --> 03:58.004
What I want you to do now

03:58.005 --> 04:01.047
is to draw the face of a clock, okay?

04:01.048 --> 04:02.488
Make it big enough

04:02.489 --> 04:04.771
so that the numbers fit
all the way around.

04:04.772 --> 04:08.615
And set the hands to 20 past 12:00.

04:08.616 --> 04:10.016
Uh, past 12:00?

04:10.017 --> 04:11.193
Yeah.

04:12.459 --> 04:14.071
Good.

04:14.421 --> 04:18.659
Now say after me,
"Let sleeping dogs lie."

04:19.386 --> 04:21.668
Let sleeping dogs lie.

04:21.668 --> 04:23.349
Can you repeat the three words

04:23.350 --> 04:25.712
that I asked you to remember
at the beginning?

04:26.249 --> 04:27.959
Flower.

04:28.435 --> 04:29.544
Mountain.

04:30.638 --> 04:32.278
Honesty.

04:32.279 --> 04:35.722
Hey. You Matty Willis?

04:35.723 --> 04:38.404
Yeah. I know you?

04:38.405 --> 04:40.126
Not at all.

04:45.693 --> 04:48.815
Patient answered "true"
to all these statements

04:48.816 --> 04:50.256
with the highest number
of true statements

04:50.257 --> 04:52.659
in the areas
of self-destructive potential

04:52.660 --> 04:54.528
and emotional dyscontrol.

04:55.062 --> 04:56.697
Here to have a talk.

04:58.906 --> 05:00.226
What about?

05:00.227 --> 05:02.108
Things you've done.

05:02.109 --> 05:03.286
Things?

05:04.111 --> 05:05.539
What things?

05:06.233 --> 05:07.513
Who the fuck are you?

05:07.514 --> 05:09.668
I'm the one who can take the sun.

05:25.853 --> 05:27.253
Hey. Clara.

05:27.254 --> 05:28.414
Hey.

05:28.415 --> 05:29.896
Is... Is our appointment today,

05:29.897 --> 05:31.577
- or is it Friday?
- Friday.

05:31.578 --> 05:34.500
They just... They said
you had a minute now, so...

05:34.501 --> 05:35.742
Indeed I do.

05:35.743 --> 05:36.983
Take a seat.

05:36.984 --> 05:38.064
Oh, sorry.

05:38.065 --> 05:39.545
That's all right.

05:40.788 --> 05:41.992
There you go.

05:44.712 --> 05:46.512
So, a detective from my case

05:46.513 --> 05:48.354
called me about Matty Willis.

05:48.355 --> 05:50.998
She said somebody attacked him.

05:54.045 --> 05:55.422
Right.

05:57.340 --> 05:59.365
Did she say what happened?

05:59.366 --> 06:02.220
Uh, they were mugging him or something.

06:02.850 --> 06:04.651
Stabbed him in the shoulder so bad,

06:04.652 --> 06:07.614
he won't be able to use
his right arm anymore.

06:08.059 --> 06:10.136
It'll just hang there.

06:10.137 --> 06:12.338
Severed the nerve, she said.

06:12.339 --> 06:13.940
Attacked?

06:13.941 --> 06:16.863
Does that mean that
they haven't caught the guy?

06:16.864 --> 06:19.025
Maybe it wasn't a guy, even.

06:19.026 --> 06:22.829
Maybe it was just some other
woman he raped before me.

06:23.871 --> 06:25.271
When they hung up,

06:25.272 --> 06:28.915
I just... went to sleep.

06:28.916 --> 06:30.707
For hours.

06:31.799 --> 06:34.560
For the first time in however long,

06:34.561 --> 06:36.322
I wasn't laying there

06:36.323 --> 06:38.924
trying to hear him coming in my window.

06:39.687 --> 06:41.551
One damn arm...

06:42.089 --> 06:45.138
I guess he won't be coming in
any more windows now.

06:45.933 --> 06:47.474
Guess he won't.

06:48.936 --> 06:51.577
Is it bad that I feel good?

06:51.578 --> 06:53.230
I mean...

06:54.501 --> 06:57.423
You know, is that... is that wrong?

06:57.424 --> 07:00.426
My concern is your therapy.

07:00.427 --> 07:01.948
Your healing.

07:01.949 --> 07:05.832
Maybe now you'll be able
to get the benefits of both.

07:28.535 --> 07:32.578
I am quite capable
of handling my own affairs.

07:32.579 --> 07:33.860
You capable of doing time?

07:33.861 --> 07:35.421
'Cause that's what this looks like.

07:37.738 --> 07:39.178
Eldon.

07:39.266 --> 07:40.735
Carl.

07:41.548 --> 07:44.190
You need money, talk to me,

07:44.191 --> 07:46.072
'cause there's ways of getting money.

07:46.073 --> 07:48.195
Would those include work?

07:50.317 --> 07:53.760
We're a week behind
with that consignment piece.

07:53.761 --> 07:57.003
I'm sure you gentlemen
have things to discuss.

07:58.628 --> 08:00.286
What was that about?

08:00.287 --> 08:01.548
Good question.

08:02.289 --> 08:04.851
Museum-grade Mayan shit.

08:04.852 --> 08:06.332
Not hot. I'll wear it.

08:06.333 --> 08:07.694
Doesn't sound like Carl.

08:07.695 --> 08:08.889
It isn't.

08:09.617 --> 08:12.138
Something going on
he's not talking about.

08:12.139 --> 08:13.620
I'll find out.

08:13.621 --> 08:15.501
I was thinking the next asshole up

08:15.502 --> 08:17.063
should be that gay-basher.

08:17.064 --> 08:18.384
The one who kept saying he was gonna

08:18.385 --> 08:20.106
come to the clinic with a gun.

08:20.107 --> 08:22.669
Pardell? Par-Par-Pardee?

08:22.670 --> 08:25.752
Pardo. Wade Pardo.

08:25.753 --> 08:27.313
He did show up.

08:27.314 --> 08:29.155
And he ran away when the cops came.

08:29.156 --> 08:30.637
I don't know where he is now.

08:30.638 --> 08:32.621
He quit his job
and dropped out of sight.

08:33.080 --> 08:34.664
Luckily for him.

08:35.707 --> 08:36.883
What's up with you?

08:37.375 --> 08:39.606
We need to talk about Matty Willis.

08:39.961 --> 08:41.808
Catastrophic blood loss.

08:41.808 --> 08:44.131
Permanent disablement of the arm.

08:44.972 --> 08:46.893
The man pulled a gun.

08:46.894 --> 08:48.695
Fastest way to neutralize the threat

08:48.696 --> 08:51.137
was disrupt the brachial plexus.

08:51.138 --> 08:53.379
I wanted him to bleed out,
he would have bled out.

08:53.380 --> 08:55.341
Yeah. I don't doubt it.

08:55.342 --> 08:57.423
This is the exact, same conversation

08:57.424 --> 09:00.148
we had about Rogelio Ortiz.

09:00.628 --> 09:03.189
Ortiz had a fish bat. Not a gun.

09:03.190 --> 09:05.528
I'm trying to help my patients

09:06.153 --> 09:08.835
by removing whatever source
of ongoing trauma

09:08.836 --> 09:11.037
is preventing them from experiencing

09:11.038 --> 09:12.438
the benefits of therapy.

09:12.439 --> 09:15.642
And I know that there are diverse means

09:15.643 --> 09:17.283
of getting to that end.

09:17.284 --> 09:20.526
I've also heard you tell a tale
about threatening people

09:20.527 --> 09:23.049
without actually
crippling them for life.

09:23.050 --> 09:25.131
In fact, I've seen you do it.

09:25.132 --> 09:27.533
Yeah, well, that's not this.

09:27.534 --> 09:30.136
This is me trying to threaten
people like you want,

09:30.137 --> 09:33.539
and everybody keeps pulling out
guns and fucking fish bats.

09:33.540 --> 09:35.461
Besides, you don't think

09:35.462 --> 09:37.463
this Matty Willis deserved what he got?

09:37.464 --> 09:42.669
Matty Willis is a violent
home-intrusion rapist with...

09:42.670 --> 09:44.671
we... we don't even know
how many victims

09:44.672 --> 09:47.794
'cause, statistically,
they probably don't even report.

09:47.795 --> 09:50.556
He walks this world
sowing misery and destruction.

09:50.557 --> 09:52.518
Of course he fucking deserved it.

09:52.519 --> 09:55.401
But... But if I have to treat
someone like Matty Willis

09:55.402 --> 09:59.525
as a victim of violent crime, you know,

09:59.526 --> 10:01.688
we're not really going about
this the right way.

10:01.689 --> 10:03.890
It's the nature of the beast, Doc.

10:03.891 --> 10:05.972
The first guy you picked, Spiegler?

10:05.973 --> 10:07.533
- Spangler.
- The drug dealer.

10:07.534 --> 10:09.335
- Put his mom in the ICU.
- Yeah.

10:09.336 --> 10:11.017
I told you from the start

10:11.018 --> 10:13.821
that is not the type of guy
who's gonna be persuaded.

10:18.946 --> 10:20.645
Well, here's the problem.

10:21.348 --> 10:23.630
I feel like a...

10:23.631 --> 10:25.792
I don't know, like a drone pilot

10:25.793 --> 10:27.513
in some desert bunker

10:27.514 --> 10:30.156
deploying terror
from thousands of miles away.

10:30.157 --> 10:31.437
Cool.

10:31.438 --> 10:33.519
No, that's <i>not</i> cool! That's exac...

10:35.362 --> 10:39.539
I need to be there
on the ground with you...

10:40.287 --> 10:42.375
exercising my own judgment.

10:42.890 --> 10:45.211
'Cause, frankly,
I'm not sure I trust yours.

10:46.814 --> 10:48.173
Sounds good.

10:49.456 --> 10:50.737
Okay.

10:54.742 --> 10:59.626
Say someone sees you
while you're doing that...

10:59.627 --> 11:01.267
enough to describe you.

11:01.268 --> 11:03.630
How long do you think
it's gonna take the cops,

11:03.631 --> 11:05.431
even using a quarter of their ass,

11:05.432 --> 11:07.313
to figure out you and your job

11:07.314 --> 11:09.836
are the common denominator
between these guys?

11:10.111 --> 11:11.758
Your patients are off their meds.

11:11.759 --> 11:13.119
They're sleeping through the night.

11:13.120 --> 11:14.824
They're looking you in the eye, right?

11:16.493 --> 11:19.204
That's how this sausage gets made, Doc.

11:19.807 --> 11:21.456
Brachial plexuses.

11:21.889 --> 11:24.501
Pardon me... plexi.

11:26.253 --> 11:29.506
Sooner you accept that,
the better off we'll be.

11:31.178 --> 11:32.659
But before Dr. Chance,

11:32.660 --> 11:34.621
I worked in
the Stanford admissions office,

11:34.622 --> 11:37.543
and that was like a 50-person staff.

11:37.544 --> 11:40.066
So you definitely can organize
multiple schedules, then.

11:40.067 --> 11:41.226
Yep.

11:42.790 --> 11:44.030
How old's your daughter now?

11:44.031 --> 11:45.391
11 months.

11:45.392 --> 11:47.233
And your parents
are helping out with her?

11:47.234 --> 11:48.274
Yeah.

11:48.275 --> 11:49.484
That's great.

11:50.077 --> 11:52.078
<i>- Is</i> that great?
- For her.

11:52.079 --> 11:54.280
They basically had me
where they wanted me.

11:54.281 --> 11:55.722
I couldn't afford to pay rent anymore,

11:55.723 --> 11:57.363
but they wouldn't let us move in

11:57.364 --> 12:00.246
until I dropped out
of my psychology grad program.

12:00.247 --> 12:01.487
For real? Why?

12:01.488 --> 12:03.449
My parents are old-school Koreans

12:03.450 --> 12:06.452
who think that mental health
is a Western construct.

12:06.453 --> 12:08.134
I think they'd honestly prefer it

12:08.135 --> 12:10.016
if I was, like, a shaman.

12:10.017 --> 12:12.418
So what would they think
if you came to work here?

12:12.419 --> 12:14.621
Oh, they'd love it...
because I would tell them

12:14.622 --> 12:18.471
I'm assistant managing
a-a sneaker store.

12:19.266 --> 12:21.507
For him. He owns a franchise.

12:21.508 --> 12:23.990
It's always been a dream of mine.

12:23.991 --> 12:25.712
Shall we give her the tour?

12:25.713 --> 12:27.874
- Sure.
- I'm gonna leave this.

12:27.875 --> 12:29.996
Yeah. I'm gonna go tell Lydia
what we're doing.

12:29.997 --> 12:31.237
All right.

12:33.120 --> 12:35.602
So, how's the, uh...?

12:35.603 --> 12:37.323
- Baby? Yeah, good.
- Mm-hmm.

12:37.324 --> 12:40.326
Um, she's nice... boss lady.

12:40.327 --> 12:42.689
Dr. Clayton? Yeah, she's very nice.

12:42.690 --> 12:44.130
If you weren't already hitting that,

12:44.131 --> 12:45.331
I'd tell you to.

12:46.253 --> 12:49.015
I am not "hitting" anyone.

12:49.016 --> 12:50.096
Okay.

12:50.097 --> 12:51.618
No, seriously. I'm not.

12:51.619 --> 12:52.899
- Gotcha.
- We ready to go?

12:52.900 --> 12:54.380
- Sure.
- Yep.

12:54.381 --> 12:56.182
We're a level-one trauma center now,

12:56.183 --> 12:57.904
open to all San Francisco residents

12:57.905 --> 12:59.425
who have been who have been
a victim of violent crimes

12:59.426 --> 13:00.907
in the last three years.

13:00.908 --> 13:03.590
We have three psychologists,
including me,

13:03.591 --> 13:05.231
three psychiatrists,

13:05.232 --> 13:07.353
and one... excuse me...

13:07.354 --> 13:08.915
and one neuropsychiatrist.

13:08.916 --> 13:10.236
Be me.

13:10.237 --> 13:11.878
Plus med students, peer counselors...

13:11.879 --> 13:13.119
...nurse practitioners.

13:13.120 --> 13:14.801
I'm so sorry.

13:14.802 --> 13:16.042
Intern orientation.

13:16.043 --> 13:17.724
And we have interns, too.

13:17.725 --> 13:19.749
Uh, that's okay. It's great to meet you.

13:19.750 --> 13:22.128
You, too. And, seriously,
I hope you take the job.

13:22.129 --> 13:23.870
Because you'd be terrific.

13:24.291 --> 13:26.664
And we need deep background on Eldon.

13:29.056 --> 13:30.536
I'm not.

13:30.537 --> 13:31.818
Deep background?

13:31.819 --> 13:33.235
I...

13:34.021 --> 13:36.582
So, what about the job?

13:36.583 --> 13:37.967
Oh, I don't know.

13:38.425 --> 13:39.906
You don't know?

13:39.907 --> 13:41.507
Uh, well, if getting you

13:41.508 --> 13:43.349
out of your mother's house
for 40 hours a week

13:43.350 --> 13:44.791
and eventually back into Stanford

13:44.792 --> 13:46.192
isn't enough incentive,

13:46.193 --> 13:47.433
I don't know what else
we can offer, so...

13:47.434 --> 13:48.915
Oh, God.

13:48.916 --> 13:50.837
You really think you have me
with that, don't you?

13:50.838 --> 13:52.023
Do I?

13:52.680 --> 13:53.960
Yes.

13:53.961 --> 13:55.276
Welcome aboard.

13:55.843 --> 13:58.488
I guess I thought this
was gonna be something else.

13:59.486 --> 14:01.007
I don't know.

14:01.574 --> 14:04.370
Victims of Violent Crime Unit...

14:04.371 --> 14:07.053
I'm not a victim of violent crime.

14:07.054 --> 14:09.055
The referral originated,

14:09.056 --> 14:12.098
uh, with Susan Lipton
at the U. S. Attorney's Office.

14:12.099 --> 14:14.420
She thought it would be helpful
if you talked to someone.

14:15.382 --> 14:17.382
She could have done her job.

14:17.945 --> 14:19.175
That would have helped.

14:19.867 --> 14:21.427
And she could have won

14:21.428 --> 14:23.509
your father's case against Dawson Pitt.

14:23.510 --> 14:26.192
No, not just Dad's... the whole thing,

14:26.193 --> 14:29.644
the umbrella case
of like 50 of the victims.

14:30.357 --> 14:31.878
But, yeah, sure.

14:31.879 --> 14:33.800
If she'd gotten Pitt to give
people their money back.

14:33.801 --> 14:35.161
But she didn't.

14:35.162 --> 14:36.359
Hmm.

14:39.126 --> 14:40.967
So how long was it after that

14:40.968 --> 14:43.241
that your father killed himself?

14:51.979 --> 14:53.793
49 days.

14:57.544 --> 14:59.966
And you were the one who found him.

15:01.308 --> 15:02.927
Uh...

15:06.433 --> 15:07.834
I...

15:09.597 --> 15:11.811
I needed to use the bathroom.

15:12.812 --> 15:16.899
I-I thought the door was stuck.

15:22.650 --> 15:24.250
Well, a shock like that...

15:24.251 --> 15:28.254
That's... That's
its own kind of violence.

15:28.255 --> 15:32.458
It's every bit as debilitating
as physical trauma,

15:32.459 --> 15:34.741
and the effects last as long,
if not longer.

15:36.143 --> 15:38.504
The numbness and the distress,

15:38.505 --> 15:41.466
the pain, the fear, the rage.

15:43.150 --> 15:45.271
That's what this is about?

15:48.195 --> 15:49.636
According to Ms. Lipton,

15:49.637 --> 15:52.518
you said that you wanted
to kill Dawson Pitt...

15:52.519 --> 15:54.240
You said it more than once.

15:54.241 --> 15:55.772
I didn't mean it.

15:56.764 --> 15:58.608
I'm sure you didn't.

15:59.366 --> 16:01.778
It... It didn't mean anything.

16:02.612 --> 16:04.197
But it did.

16:10.618 --> 16:12.058
- No, I-I...
- You were fucking texting?

16:12.059 --> 16:13.339
No, I wasn't texting.

16:13.340 --> 16:14.941
I was minding...
I just turned the corner.

16:14.942 --> 16:16.222
I don't know,
you just came out of nowhere.

16:16.223 --> 16:17.503
I came out of nowhere?

16:17.504 --> 16:19.713
- I was parked. You ran into me.
- Hey.

16:20.227 --> 16:22.228
I was waiting, like, forever
for the bus. Sorry.

16:22.229 --> 16:23.469
- Hey. You all right?
- Yeah.

16:23.470 --> 16:24.711
- Yeah?
- Yeah?

16:24.712 --> 16:26.392
Do we have to get tickets still?

16:26.393 --> 16:27.674
- What am I looking at? That!
- I don't even...

16:27.675 --> 16:29.355
- I don't...
- Okay, fine.

16:29.356 --> 16:31.237
No, it's, uh... It's a preview.

16:31.238 --> 16:33.279
- We can just walk in.
- Okay.

16:33.280 --> 16:34.841
Do I look like I have that kind of time?

16:34.842 --> 16:36.683
I think it's there... 2408.

16:36.684 --> 16:38.124
Look, I know a guy

16:38.125 --> 16:39.485
who can pop that dent for a buck fifty.

16:39.486 --> 16:40.807
$150 for that?!

16:40.808 --> 16:42.568
I just tapped you! That's ridiculous!

16:42.569 --> 16:43.690
Right. And left a dent.

16:43.691 --> 16:44.811
No! No! It...

16:44.812 --> 16:46.781
His bumper's too low.

16:47.815 --> 16:49.215
The dent in your bumper's

16:49.216 --> 16:50.897
too high for him to make contact.

16:50.898 --> 16:52.178
He didn't do it.

16:52.179 --> 16:53.539
Dad.

16:53.540 --> 16:55.790
Who are you, Joe fucking Allstate?

16:56.303 --> 16:58.504
He dinged my truck,
and now he's making it right.

16:58.505 --> 17:00.711
Why don't you mind
your own fucking business?

17:01.308 --> 17:02.672
He didn't do it.

17:03.871 --> 17:05.231
So now I'm a liar?

17:05.232 --> 17:06.752
"Now"?

17:06.753 --> 17:09.095
I don't think this is your first time.

17:09.597 --> 17:10.997
Every instinct I have

17:10.998 --> 17:13.808
says to grind you into a fucking pulp.

17:14.922 --> 17:16.843
No, that's not instinct.

17:16.844 --> 17:19.444
Instinct is behavior
based on prior experience.

17:19.445 --> 17:21.728
I think you've had plenty of experience,

17:21.729 --> 17:23.009
through an abusive father

17:23.010 --> 17:25.570
or maybe you weren't
listened to or valued,

17:25.571 --> 17:28.134
so you compensate for
that lack of value in private

17:28.135 --> 17:29.455
by acting out in public

17:29.456 --> 17:31.057
and taking it out on guys like that.

17:31.058 --> 17:32.779
Or, here's another theory.

17:32.780 --> 17:34.745
There's plenty of evidence for it.

17:35.342 --> 17:37.248
You're just a fucking prick.

17:37.785 --> 17:39.666
Dad!

17:42.469 --> 17:44.070
You're gonna be lucky
if you live long enough

17:44.071 --> 17:46.793
to dance with her
at her wedding, you fuck.

17:46.794 --> 17:48.554
- Dad, what are you doing?!
- What the fuck are you looking at?

17:48.555 --> 17:49.796
- Get in your car!
- Stop.

18:05.933 --> 18:07.361
Thank you.

18:07.735 --> 18:09.375
It's different.

18:09.376 --> 18:12.378
- Oh, yeah, yeah.
- Hmm.

18:12.379 --> 18:14.911
It's, um...

18:17.705 --> 18:20.708
Well, now, that is something
I could look at every day.

18:22.790 --> 18:24.253
What do you think?

18:27.234 --> 18:29.916
Yeah, I'm gonna need
more information than that.

18:29.917 --> 18:33.359
It's 8 grand. You don't have 8 grand.

18:33.360 --> 18:34.681
It's an investment.

18:34.682 --> 18:36.924
I'll leave it to you when I die.

18:47.054 --> 18:48.935
Do you have something
you want to say to me?

18:49.195 --> 18:50.617
You're gonna die pretty soon

18:50.618 --> 18:52.859
if you don't stop picking fights
with random assholes

18:52.860 --> 18:54.575
like that dummy with the truck.

18:55.582 --> 18:58.144
I just wanted him to shut up.

18:58.145 --> 18:59.986
Don't you feel like that sometimes?

18:59.987 --> 19:02.388
Pepper's mom said this thing
to her the other day.

19:02.389 --> 19:03.630
Oh, really?

19:03.631 --> 19:04.951
Does it got anything to do

19:04.952 --> 19:06.232
with why she named her daughter Emily

19:06.233 --> 19:07.954
and yet calls her "Pepper"?

19:07.955 --> 19:09.996
- 'Cause I really don't get that.
- It's a nickname.

19:09.997 --> 19:11.998
She said, if Pepper was
thinking about doing something,

19:11.999 --> 19:14.400
she should try to imagine
the worst possible outcome.

19:14.401 --> 19:16.362
And if she could live with it,
then she should go ahead.

19:16.363 --> 19:18.164
But if she couldn't imagine it,
or live with it...

19:18.165 --> 19:22.048
Yeah, but she's talking about
drugs, probably, or drinking.

19:22.049 --> 19:24.063
What if that guy had gotten a tire iron?

19:25.147 --> 19:27.942
Is it cool for me to act
like that, or only you?

19:29.296 --> 19:30.403
Why?

19:30.778 --> 19:32.258
Are you thinking of doing something

19:32.259 --> 19:33.820
that has an outcome you can't live with?

19:33.821 --> 19:35.074
Again?

19:38.505 --> 19:39.870
I'm sorry. I...

19:47.503 --> 19:49.046
You should buy it.

19:50.638 --> 19:51.841
You think so?

19:52.359 --> 19:53.559
Yes.

19:59.486 --> 20:01.127
Here you go.

20:01.128 --> 20:02.970
Thank you.

20:04.652 --> 20:06.653
Mm-hmm.

20:06.654 --> 20:08.735
So, I left you alone with the deck.

20:10.778 --> 20:12.778
Don't be afraid.

20:13.220 --> 20:14.901
Ah, you got one too many cards.

20:14.902 --> 20:16.342
- What?!
- Don't.

20:16.343 --> 20:18.344
How is that... You just randomly take...

20:18.345 --> 20:20.106
I randomly took from mine, too.

20:20.107 --> 20:21.948
Unbelievable.

20:21.949 --> 20:23.229
Whew.

20:23.230 --> 20:25.952
This hand is a house full of strangers.

20:25.953 --> 20:27.634
You are so hostile.

20:27.635 --> 20:31.317
I love how you think I can
control the cards you get.

20:31.318 --> 20:32.719
But I am glad they suck.

20:32.720 --> 20:34.160
Oh, I am well acquainted

20:34.161 --> 20:36.042
with the limits of what you can do.

20:36.043 --> 20:37.604
- Hmm.
- I don't want the discard.

20:37.605 --> 20:39.055
Me, neither.

20:46.093 --> 20:48.054
Like all good men aspire to do,

20:48.055 --> 20:49.896
I've given you what you want.

20:49.897 --> 20:51.377
Not on purpose.

20:51.378 --> 20:54.540
My decency and generosity
know no bounds.

20:54.541 --> 20:57.023
I just can't help but do right.

20:57.024 --> 20:59.706
My God, you're like a fucking sea gull.

20:59.707 --> 21:03.954
Swooping in to eat abandoned
hot dogs on the beach.

21:05.953 --> 21:07.708
I found this in the bathroom.

21:08.075 --> 21:10.336
Would you rather play chess instead?

21:11.518 --> 21:14.841
No, I-I don't play chess anymore.

21:14.842 --> 21:16.362
I used to. I don't.

21:16.363 --> 21:18.469
Well, that's a shame.

21:19.086 --> 21:21.055
I kind of like chess.

21:21.568 --> 21:23.049
Gin!

21:23.050 --> 21:24.210
Really? Uh-huh.

21:24.211 --> 21:25.491
You're a hell beast.

21:25.492 --> 21:26.733
Mmm.

21:26.734 --> 21:28.494
This is horrible.

21:28.495 --> 21:31.017
It seems like maybe you're
gonna need a minute, so...

21:31.018 --> 21:32.650
Yeah, yeah.

21:33.540 --> 21:35.541
I am going to grab a shower.

21:35.542 --> 21:36.383
All right.

21:56.123 --> 21:58.324
Pinto, eyes up.

21:58.325 --> 22:00.126
Gather round.

22:00.127 --> 22:02.809
The key word is stealth.

22:02.810 --> 22:04.490
We're not looking to wrestle.

22:04.491 --> 22:06.773
We're looking to be fucking invisible.

22:06.774 --> 22:08.695
First, I need a leveraging move.

22:08.696 --> 22:11.577
Here's one... Forearms
to your target's back.

22:11.578 --> 22:13.499
Both hands shoot over his traps,

22:13.500 --> 22:16.342
catch the chin, and snap the head back.

22:16.343 --> 22:20.586
Now you shoot the arm,
lock up the choke.

22:20.587 --> 22:22.789
Grab my arm.

22:22.790 --> 22:24.871
That's the instinctual move right there,

22:24.872 --> 22:26.633
which is good for me... Why?

22:26.634 --> 22:29.075
- He's not going for a weapon.
- Right on.

22:29.076 --> 22:31.838
I can feel his hands, I'm good to go.

22:31.839 --> 22:33.840
Lock in the choke.

22:33.841 --> 22:35.441
Can't be broken without a weapon.

22:35.442 --> 22:36.963
Drop your hands.

22:36.964 --> 22:39.925
I can't feel his hands,
I need to deal with that.

22:47.294 --> 22:48.895
All right. Pair up.

22:48.896 --> 22:51.297
Let's run through it. Time your chokes.

22:51.298 --> 22:53.660
4 to 5 seconds, he's out for 20.

22:53.661 --> 22:55.742
Hold it for 20, he's out for 40.

22:55.743 --> 22:57.944
Hold it for 40, he's dead.

22:57.945 --> 22:59.065
All right, do it again.

22:59.066 --> 23:00.346
I want to see two beats...

23:00.347 --> 23:03.069
leverage move, choke, then lights out.

23:03.070 --> 23:06.202
5 seconds tops, unless you
really don't like the guy.

23:08.836 --> 23:11.117
Sorry, Mac.

23:11.118 --> 23:12.278
Snap the head, shoot the arm.

23:12.279 --> 23:13.359
Yeah, yeah, I know.

23:13.360 --> 23:14.921
I've been choked out before, Doc.

23:14.922 --> 23:16.843
I'm sure you have.

23:16.844 --> 23:18.084
I just... Why don't you do it to me?

23:18.085 --> 23:20.046
- You don't want to go?
- No, it's okay.

23:20.047 --> 23:22.488
You're not crushing the guy's windpipe,
for Christ's sake.

23:22.489 --> 23:24.130
It's about blood flow.

23:24.428 --> 23:26.653
It's about oxygen deprivation.

23:26.806 --> 23:28.935
Starvation. Death of cells.

23:29.350 --> 23:31.097
Actually, it's about vasodilation

23:31.098 --> 23:33.179
and dropping the blood pressure.

23:34.421 --> 23:35.902
Say good night, Doc.

23:56.523 --> 23:58.337
Jesus.

23:59.086 --> 24:01.207
His blood pressure's actually fine.

24:01.208 --> 24:02.769
Bizarrely fine.

24:02.770 --> 24:04.891
Table salt plays a critical role

24:04.892 --> 24:07.934
in helping your digestive system
absorb nutrients.

24:07.935 --> 24:10.977
"Nutrients." It's not kale, you know?

24:10.978 --> 24:15.942
Also, it's essential for maintaining
normal fluid levels in cells,

24:15.943 --> 24:19.345
contracting muscles,
sending nerve impulses.

24:19.346 --> 24:22.348
I bet your ankles are so swollen
you can't even see the bones.

24:22.349 --> 24:24.350
I'm fairly sure,
whether I can see them or not,

24:24.351 --> 24:25.632
they're there.

24:25.633 --> 24:27.273
Just... Just let him eat, will you?

24:27.274 --> 24:28.354
Listen to the man.

24:28.355 --> 24:29.996
Unbelievable.

24:29.997 --> 24:32.580
It's like you both have
death wishes or something.

24:34.441 --> 24:35.762
What?

24:35.763 --> 24:37.323
He's just constantly

24:37.324 --> 24:39.005
getting into these things
with people these days.

24:39.006 --> 24:41.247
Like, I come to meet him
on Clement Street,

24:41.248 --> 24:42.969
and he's in some big
truck-driving guy's face

24:42.970 --> 24:44.633
over parking or whatever.

24:45.052 --> 24:47.053
And last week, we were on BART...

24:47.054 --> 24:49.856
Oh, come on,
that's just a bunch of kids.

24:49.857 --> 24:51.257
- They were...
- Scary gang-banging kids.

24:51.258 --> 24:52.418
They were not.

24:52.419 --> 24:53.620
Bluetooth speaker blasting.

24:53.621 --> 24:55.101
He goes over and just turns it off.

24:55.102 --> 24:57.263
- You touched their shit?
- Yes, I touched their...

24:57.264 --> 24:59.105
- What did they do?
- Just stared at him.

24:59.106 --> 25:01.467
I think they were too shocked to react.

25:01.468 --> 25:03.509
And then this other time,
we're in the supermarket,

25:03.510 --> 25:05.592
and Dad sees this guy grab
his son by the arm, so...

25:05.593 --> 25:07.233
Well...

25:07.781 --> 25:10.036
Mom.

25:10.037 --> 25:11.452
Just take it.

25:17.885 --> 25:20.044
The fuck are you up to, brother?

25:21.795 --> 25:22.929
What do you mean?

25:26.934 --> 25:28.761
You always say yourself that...

25:29.456 --> 25:31.738
bullies are usually cowards.

25:31.739 --> 25:33.339
Is why you're going around

25:33.340 --> 25:35.942
randomly trying to get shit
to jump off with them?

25:35.943 --> 25:38.104
She's just blowing stuff
out of proportion.

25:38.105 --> 25:41.107
She sounded pretty proportional to me.

25:41.523 --> 25:44.030
Is this something you're doing
for the good of your patients,

25:44.031 --> 25:46.528
or is it something
completely fucking different?

25:48.796 --> 25:49.990
I don't know.

25:51.318 --> 25:54.662
I'm just... being present.

25:55.923 --> 25:57.665
Being in the world.

25:58.686 --> 26:02.809
Yeah, well, the next time
you're doing that,

26:02.810 --> 26:07.413
I think I'd better be there
to exercise my own judgment,

26:07.414 --> 26:09.635
'cause I don't think I trust yours.

26:10.658 --> 26:14.020
In fact, if this is what
you're getting up to, Doc,

26:14.021 --> 26:16.703
then it should be in service
of the mission.

26:16.704 --> 26:18.504
Of your patients.

26:18.505 --> 26:20.827
You're putting yourself
out there like that...

26:20.828 --> 26:21.908
come with me.

26:21.909 --> 26:23.069
Do it for them.

26:23.399 --> 26:24.951
Otherwise, cut the shit.

26:25.401 --> 26:26.993
You can even call the ball.

26:26.994 --> 26:30.597
We can persuade and threaten
and not create a victim

26:30.598 --> 26:31.998
out of whoever you want.

26:32.591 --> 26:33.993
How's that?

26:35.522 --> 26:36.803
Good.

26:36.804 --> 26:37.913
Okay.

27:14.561 --> 27:16.162
So this is the best you got?

27:16.163 --> 27:17.523
This is everything... your best?

27:17.524 --> 27:18.845
- Absolutely.
- Yep. You're gonna like it.

27:18.846 --> 27:20.166
All right, let's see.

27:22.089 --> 27:24.130
No way! That's impossible!

27:24.131 --> 27:25.892
You can... No way you can do that!

27:25.893 --> 27:27.171
How?!

27:27.855 --> 27:29.131
All right.

27:32.940 --> 27:34.540
Dawson Pitt?

27:34.541 --> 27:37.583
Yeah. We know each other?

27:37.584 --> 27:38.825
Not just yet.

27:38.826 --> 27:40.684
But I was hoping we could talk.

27:41.428 --> 27:42.869
About...?

27:42.870 --> 27:44.605
Outside would be better.

27:45.232 --> 27:46.793
Where we can actually hear.

27:46.794 --> 27:48.192
It's important.

27:48.996 --> 27:50.156
I got a tip for you.

27:50.157 --> 27:51.998
You're gonna want to hear this.

27:51.999 --> 27:53.559
Trust me.

28:20.467 --> 28:22.017
Here?

28:23.030 --> 28:24.270
It's a little weird.

28:24.271 --> 28:27.073
It's very, uh, cloak-and-dagger, dude.

28:27.074 --> 28:31.037
But, uh... whatever.

28:31.038 --> 28:33.028
Lay it on me. What do you got?

28:34.001 --> 28:35.882
James Swanson.

28:35.883 --> 28:37.123
I don't...

28:37.124 --> 28:39.076
He's a former client of yours.

28:39.647 --> 28:42.871
Shot himself after you took
all his money.

28:44.171 --> 28:45.652
His son wants the money back,

28:45.653 --> 28:47.167
and you're gonna give it to him.

28:48.736 --> 28:50.671
Oh, really?

28:51.899 --> 28:53.257
Come on, Dawson.

28:53.861 --> 28:55.884
You don't even think about it?

28:56.944 --> 28:58.424
You ever think about
the damage you've done,

28:58.425 --> 28:59.746
the pain you've caused?

28:59.747 --> 29:00.947
There's not some little part of you

29:00.948 --> 29:02.348
that wants to make it right?

29:02.349 --> 29:04.350
I don't know who you are
or what you really want,

29:04.351 --> 29:07.033
but that case was litigated and blocked.

29:07.034 --> 29:08.755
And even if it hadn't been?

29:08.756 --> 29:10.156
Fuck the fuck off!

29:10.157 --> 29:12.109
Listen to me.

29:12.920 --> 29:15.922
Alex Swanson has got friends
you do not want to meet.

29:15.923 --> 29:17.403
- Trust me.
- Yeah?

29:17.404 --> 29:21.087
Tell Alex if any more
of his friends try to see me,

29:21.088 --> 29:24.891
I will sue his broke,
fatherless ass for harassment.

29:24.892 --> 29:26.212
Now get your hands off me!

29:26.213 --> 29:27.453
Don't you fucking touch me!

29:27.454 --> 29:29.896
You are not fucking listening to me!

29:29.897 --> 29:32.218
- Listen!
- Get the fuck off of me, motherfucker!

29:32.219 --> 29:33.459
No!

29:39.627 --> 29:42.188
Fucking... Fucking shit!

30:12.620 --> 30:15.214
I wouldn't say that went well.

30:16.383 --> 30:17.944
Yeah.

30:17.945 --> 30:19.092
I...

30:21.829 --> 30:23.670
I don't know what happened.

30:23.671 --> 30:25.015
I do.

30:26.126 --> 30:27.527
I used to work with guys,

30:27.635 --> 30:29.716
back when I was collecting money...

30:29.717 --> 30:32.639
Some of 'em, when it went too easy,

30:32.640 --> 30:34.400
there wasn't a fight,

30:34.401 --> 30:36.923
they used to be dangerous to be around.

30:36.924 --> 30:39.365
They needed that adrenaline dump.

30:39.366 --> 30:41.406
You could see it in their faces.

30:44.411 --> 30:46.092
What are you saying?

30:46.093 --> 30:49.976
I'm saying I know you want to be
on the ground for this shit.

30:49.977 --> 30:52.258
But to be on the ground,
you got to be in control.

30:52.259 --> 30:53.500
And you're not.

30:55.703 --> 30:58.144
So I'm sending you
back to the bunker, Doc.

30:58.145 --> 31:00.634
Busting you back to drone pilot.

31:01.308 --> 31:02.669
'Cause you talk about

31:02.670 --> 31:04.390
not wanting to create any new victims,

31:04.391 --> 31:07.073
but you sure seemed to like doing it.

31:20.628 --> 31:22.383
Just making a plan...

31:23.450 --> 31:24.891
for if there ever comes a moment

31:24.892 --> 31:26.728
where you feel like you could leave.

31:26.729 --> 31:28.495
Or if you feel like you have to.

31:29.897 --> 31:33.700
Just so you know exactly where
you'd be going if you left.

31:33.701 --> 31:35.141
All right?

31:35.142 --> 31:38.344
We don't... We don't
have to do anything.

31:38.345 --> 31:40.340
We're just... We're just talking.

31:41.591 --> 31:42.989
Okay.

31:43.427 --> 31:45.632
You don't have to do anything,
but you'll know you could.

31:45.633 --> 31:46.638
All right?

31:47.973 --> 31:48.995
Okay.

31:50.100 --> 31:52.279
So where do you think you might go?

32:00.688 --> 32:02.362
My sister, maybe.

32:05.332 --> 32:06.825
Although I feel like...

32:08.215 --> 32:11.163
if he asked her where I was,
she would tell him.

32:13.260 --> 32:16.542
She says she doesn't, but she likes him.

32:16.793 --> 32:18.424
All right.

32:18.425 --> 32:20.466
Not your sister.

32:20.467 --> 32:23.350
Um, is there anywhere else?

32:27.835 --> 32:32.351
My last birthday, we had a cake at work.

32:34.762 --> 32:39.445
And after, my boss said
if I ever needed anything,

32:39.446 --> 32:41.068
she would help me, no matter what.

32:43.651 --> 32:47.574
Just, like, out of nowhere.

32:50.417 --> 32:51.995
So maybe her.

32:52.660 --> 32:53.914
I could ask.

32:55.783 --> 32:57.143
Good.

32:57.144 --> 32:58.504
Now, before we go,

32:58.505 --> 33:00.186
if we have to call you for any reason,

33:00.187 --> 33:02.148
are we still the gynecologist?

33:02.149 --> 33:05.151
Yeah, uh, but Dr. Simms left,

33:05.152 --> 33:08.074
so they moved me over to Dr. Diamond.

33:08.075 --> 33:10.180
Diamond. All right.

33:13.921 --> 33:16.269
You must get tired, huh?

33:16.764 --> 33:17.729
What?

33:18.525 --> 33:19.898
How do you mean?

33:21.208 --> 33:23.485
Talking about this so much,

33:24.932 --> 33:27.406
but then nothing happens.

33:29.296 --> 33:31.368
Nothing changes.

33:34.942 --> 33:36.998
You know, when we first started,

33:37.464 --> 33:38.785
you wouldn't talk about any of this.

33:38.786 --> 33:39.793
You couldn't.

33:40.748 --> 33:42.869
Now, with every week that's gone by,

33:42.870 --> 33:44.339
I've seen a change in you.

33:45.549 --> 33:47.233
You got off the Lexapro,

33:47.234 --> 33:49.315
and you're holding yourself straighter.

33:49.316 --> 33:51.179
You're valuing yourself.

33:53.140 --> 33:55.522
You'll... You'll do this
when you're ready.

33:59.326 --> 34:00.439
What if I...?

34:02.529 --> 34:05.252
What if I don't, though?

34:08.815 --> 34:09.947
Then you won't.

34:12.059 --> 34:13.534
But you will.

34:17.905 --> 34:18.956
Yeah.

34:48.415 --> 34:50.071
Hey.

34:50.898 --> 34:52.538
Jesus.

34:52.539 --> 34:54.540
Sorry. Didn't mean to scare you.

34:54.541 --> 34:56.422
I just had to take a load off.

34:56.786 --> 34:58.344
What are you doing here?

34:58.345 --> 35:00.186
Long time no see, Doc.

35:00.187 --> 35:01.958
We need to talk.

35:06.794 --> 35:08.636
Here you go.

35:12.039 --> 35:15.202
Confusion to our enemies.

35:19.727 --> 35:21.848
Ahh.

35:23.330 --> 35:24.570
You mind?

35:24.571 --> 35:26.212
No.

35:26.650 --> 35:28.294
So, what is this?

35:28.693 --> 35:32.899
You ever have one of those cases
that keep you awake at night

35:32.900 --> 35:34.981
and make you wonder
if you can fix things,

35:34.982 --> 35:38.384
or what's the fucking point of anything?

35:38.385 --> 35:40.830
I'm sure you've had one
of those, right, Doc?

35:41.468 --> 35:42.989
Well, this one's mine.

35:42.990 --> 35:46.633
I had an informant
from an Ohio... Travis.

35:46.836 --> 35:48.463
He's a good kid.

35:49.516 --> 35:51.397
He liked jewelry and drugs.

35:51.398 --> 35:54.000
One night, he was breaking
into a high-end car

35:54.001 --> 35:55.401
down on Toland Street,

35:55.402 --> 35:57.764
and just before he got the trunk open,

35:57.765 --> 35:59.599
someone shot him in the head.

36:02.009 --> 36:04.229
He didn't die, though. You believe it?

36:04.892 --> 36:07.654
Small caliber, oblique angle...

36:07.655 --> 36:09.175
skated around his skull

36:09.176 --> 36:11.057
until it landed behind his eye socket.

36:11.058 --> 36:13.459
So, eventually, he was able
to give me a make of the car

36:13.460 --> 36:14.861
and a partial plate number.

36:14.862 --> 36:16.342
The fact that it was even there

36:16.343 --> 36:18.504
was interesting in light of the fact

36:18.505 --> 36:24.110
that I was called to this scene
the next day,

36:24.111 --> 36:25.792
a block away.

36:26.433 --> 36:29.421
It'd be stupid to think
they weren't related.

36:30.517 --> 36:32.158
A block away, same night.

36:32.159 --> 36:34.160
Woman found with her throat cut,

36:34.161 --> 36:36.122
kid shot in the head breaking into a car

36:36.123 --> 36:37.924
that shouldn't even have been there.

36:37.925 --> 36:41.891
It registered to a Ryan Winter.

36:43.143 --> 36:45.812
Now, you don't seem like you're
too up on the tech world,

36:45.813 --> 36:48.374
but the man's made a ton of money in it.

36:48.375 --> 36:50.817
He's given away enough to earn a halo.

36:50.818 --> 36:52.418
Read an article once

36:52.419 --> 36:55.280
that he said he wants to die
with his pockets empty.

36:55.783 --> 36:57.784
People think he's charming.

36:58.033 --> 37:00.907
Well, people think all
rich people are charming.

37:00.908 --> 37:02.949
But I've looked into him more than most,

37:02.950 --> 37:05.248
and I've never once seen him smile.

37:07.755 --> 37:10.917
What about this... this
informant... Travis?

37:10.918 --> 37:12.719
You had what he told you...

37:12.720 --> 37:14.961
Wasn't that circumstantial evidence?

37:14.962 --> 37:16.362
Could've been.

37:16.363 --> 37:19.045
But, um, once Travis left the hospital,

37:19.046 --> 37:20.406
he disappeared.

37:20.407 --> 37:22.328
Everybody said he went back to Ohio,

37:22.329 --> 37:23.770
but I didn't believe that.

37:23.771 --> 37:26.092
But I couldn't find him anyway,

37:26.093 --> 37:27.694
and without him,
I don't have probable cause.

37:27.695 --> 37:29.776
Without him, I don't have shit.

37:30.148 --> 37:31.497
Okay.

37:31.498 --> 37:33.259
So what's this got to do with me?

37:33.260 --> 37:36.663
Well, you get in people's heads
for a living, right, Doc?

37:36.664 --> 37:38.782
I've tried everything I could do.

37:39.586 --> 37:42.188
So I'm gonna need you to get

37:42.189 --> 37:44.371
into Ryan Winter's head for me.

37:45.833 --> 37:50.335
So... take a look at all this.

37:51.278 --> 37:53.004
And when you're done...

37:55.362 --> 37:57.004
we'll get started.

38:01.609 --> 38:03.723
What happens if I say no?

38:05.773 --> 38:07.213
What happens?

38:07.214 --> 38:10.814
You think you know things. And you do.

38:11.739 --> 38:13.983
You know that Blackstone threatened me.

38:14.501 --> 38:16.069
You know that he beat me.

38:16.463 --> 38:18.945
That I got scared, came to you for help.

38:18.946 --> 38:22.308
You know that I saw his wife...
more than just once.

38:22.309 --> 38:24.430
But there's not one thing you know

38:24.431 --> 38:28.248
that can prove that my story
about how I fell isn't true.

38:29.797 --> 38:31.958
Well, you being unaware
of recent developments...

38:31.959 --> 38:33.962
I can see why you'd say that.

38:34.762 --> 38:37.764
You remember the car crash
down at the beach that night?

38:37.765 --> 38:40.326
Couple of Romanians in a Mercedes?

38:40.327 --> 38:41.848
Well, I forgot about them, too,

38:41.849 --> 38:43.089
until the Sacramento PD

38:43.090 --> 38:45.432
picked them up on an old gun warrant.

38:45.933 --> 38:49.495
And remembering them
made me remember you.

38:49.496 --> 38:51.217
Now, they're a couple of hard cases.

38:51.218 --> 38:52.418
Not big talkers.

38:52.419 --> 38:53.539
But what do you think they'd say

38:53.540 --> 38:55.061
if I went down there and told them

38:55.062 --> 38:57.824
I could get them some traction
if they were to tell me

38:57.825 --> 39:00.530
why they were really
at the beach that night.

39:01.348 --> 39:03.750
You think they'd tell me
stuff I already know?

39:03.751 --> 39:06.312
Or, maybe, do you think they'd tell me

39:06.313 --> 39:09.372
if they seen who really
killed Blackstone?

39:09.677 --> 39:12.625
Or they're gonna tell me
that your story's true?

39:14.081 --> 39:17.043
You know, there's something
different about you, Doc,

39:17.044 --> 39:18.524
from the guy I met last year,

39:18.525 --> 39:20.927
something in your... your eyes.

39:20.928 --> 39:22.769
Or maybe that guy was the put-on,

39:22.770 --> 39:24.512
and this is the real you.

39:25.172 --> 39:27.533
But...

39:27.534 --> 39:28.775
...I guess it doesn't matter

39:28.776 --> 39:30.602
'cause we're in this together now.

39:31.138 --> 39:33.019
Whoever you are.

39:53.480 --> 39:55.481
So somebody killed somebody.

39:55.482 --> 39:56.883
Fucking awesome.

39:56.884 --> 39:58.605
How is it my problem?

39:58.606 --> 40:01.257
Because this fucking cop Hynes says so?

40:02.169 --> 40:05.612
Well, uh, yeah, that's a place to start.

40:05.613 --> 40:06.853
He's a cop.

40:06.854 --> 40:08.094
So was Blackstone.

40:08.095 --> 40:10.416
I haven't met one worth two shits.

40:10.417 --> 40:14.180
You do this... We do this... What then?

40:14.181 --> 40:15.581
We're done?

40:15.582 --> 40:18.224
He's got us by the balls is what.

40:18.225 --> 40:20.506
You want to be
this fucking guy's lackey?

40:20.507 --> 40:22.278
That is not happening.

40:22.790 --> 40:25.990
Set a meet. I'll stab him in the eye.

40:27.354 --> 40:30.537
Now, how did I know that
that was gonna be your fix?

40:31.599 --> 40:33.519
For all we know, this guy Hynes,

40:33.520 --> 40:35.762
he's more like us
than he's like Blackstone.

40:35.763 --> 40:38.364
Could be tired, he's frustrated,
he's hamstrung,

40:38.365 --> 40:40.687
he's tired of all the bullshit
he's got to go through

40:40.688 --> 40:42.173
to do the right thing.

40:43.330 --> 40:47.173
And this Winter guy... He's for real.

40:47.174 --> 40:48.815
He's worse than any of the predators

40:48.816 --> 40:50.265
we've had to deal with.

40:51.939 --> 40:54.540
He's worth directing
our energies towards.

40:54.541 --> 40:57.023
Any cop that would resort to blackmail's

40:57.024 --> 40:58.304
got something to hide.

40:58.305 --> 41:00.186
And I want to know what.

41:00.187 --> 41:02.709
He's got a hammer over us?
I want one over him.

41:02.710 --> 41:05.071
I want a hammer to hold over
this fucker's fucking head

41:05.072 --> 41:06.793
for thinking he fucking owns us.

41:06.794 --> 41:10.285
Yeah, but he <i>does</i> own me, D.

41:11.619 --> 41:13.439
That's the truth of it.

41:13.440 --> 41:15.602
He puts the San Francisco Police on me,

41:15.603 --> 41:17.243
I'm not gonna make it.

41:17.244 --> 41:20.126
If it's between holding out or prison,

41:20.127 --> 41:22.046
eventually, I'm gonna tell them...

41:22.569 --> 41:24.570
tell them whatever they want to know.

41:24.571 --> 41:26.212
About what I did. About Carl.

41:26.213 --> 41:27.427
About you.

41:28.303 --> 41:30.430
I can't leave my daughter.

41:30.898 --> 41:32.307
I wont.

41:32.860 --> 41:34.580
We do have a choice.

41:34.581 --> 41:37.383
You sit tight. I check out Hynes.

41:37.384 --> 41:39.025
Go home.

41:39.026 --> 41:41.232
Take a shower. Cool your blood.

41:45.833 --> 41:47.473
<i>- Oh, okay.</i>
<i>- He saw me.</i>

41:47.474 --> 41:49.275
<i>You can't touch that.</i>

41:50.397 --> 41:51.718
<i>I didn't see anything.</i>

41:51.719 --> 41:53.399
<i>Sure. That's okay.</i>

41:53.400 --> 41:54.761
<i>He saw me.</i>

41:54.786 --> 41:56.042
<i>It's okay. Nobody's gonna...</i>

41:56.043 --> 41:57.724
<i>What if he knows I didn't die?</i>

41:57.725 --> 42:00.326
<i>You're safe now. Get some rest.</i>

42:00.327 --> 42:04.370
I did a search by method
and functional characteristics.

42:04.371 --> 42:06.492
I found three more women...

42:06.493 --> 42:10.536
one in Hayward, one in Oakland,
one in San Jose.

42:10.537 --> 42:12.779
All in the same 10-year age range.

42:12.780 --> 42:14.380
All with their throats cut.

42:14.381 --> 42:16.382
And I can place Ryan Winter

42:16.383 --> 42:19.345
in the vicinity of all three
of these murders.

44:00.728 --> 44:02.528
9-1-1. What's your emergency?

44:02.529 --> 44:04.050
Someone's hurt.

44:04.051 --> 44:06.973
Uh... Uh, I don't know.
Mugging, or... Yeah.

44:06.974 --> 44:08.294
There's, uh... There's blood.

44:08.295 --> 44:10.256
I think he hit his head on the pavement.

44:10.257 --> 44:12.378
Can you hurry, please?
