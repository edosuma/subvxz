00:25.896 --> 00:27.929
Hey. Guys say you met
Derek Jeter.

00:27.981 --> 00:29.463
That true?

00:29.516 --> 00:30.900
Yeah, once.

00:30.967 --> 00:33.486
How's that happen to
a <i>malihini</i> like you?

00:33.570 --> 00:35.187
You're just a baby.

00:35.272 --> 00:37.506
I played for the Honolulu
Sharks for a minute.

00:37.574 --> 00:39.158
He, uh, came to visit once.

00:39.242 --> 00:40.442
How'd you end up here?

00:40.494 --> 00:42.678
Blew out my UCL.

00:42.746 --> 00:45.314
By the time my elbow healed,
Hawaii Winter Baseball folded.

00:46.533 --> 00:49.168
So here I am.

00:50.554 --> 00:52.321
What's up with this white van?

00:52.372 --> 00:54.507
Oh. That's just Manny.
He delivers bread.

00:54.591 --> 00:57.126
No worries, brah. You'll
learn the route soon enough.

00:57.194 --> 00:58.894
It's only your first day.

01:56.753 --> 01:58.220
We good?

01:58.271 --> 01:59.955
We're good.

02:29.585 --> 02:31.753
Kid, look out!

02:38.612 --> 02:41.030
Please.

02:41.097 --> 02:42.648
My wife's about to have a baby.

03:34.067 --> 03:35.751
Hey, you tired yet?

03:35.819 --> 03:39.488
I'm not hiring
your brothers. Okay?

03:39.556 --> 03:41.390
Best contractors
on the island, brah.

03:41.458 --> 03:42.925
Save you the sweat.

03:42.993 --> 03:45.261
And doing it myself
will save me the money.

03:45.328 --> 03:47.229
You come around,
and when you do,

03:47.297 --> 03:50.065
I'll be right here
to make that call.

03:50.116 --> 03:52.134
All right, Kamekona? You want
to hang around, that's fine.

03:52.202 --> 03:54.069
Why don't you pick up a hammer
and make yourself useful?

03:54.137 --> 03:55.537
I already help.

03:55.605 --> 03:58.007
You come to me to cut you
a deal on the wood--

03:58.074 --> 03:59.275
this the best
on the island.

03:59.342 --> 04:01.076
You mean this?

04:01.144 --> 04:03.162
You get what you paid for, brah.

04:03.230 --> 04:04.680
This stuff don't grow on trees.

04:06.683 --> 04:07.783
Yo.

04:07.851 --> 04:08.784
Hey.

04:08.852 --> 04:10.052
Howzit, <i>haole.</i>

04:10.120 --> 04:11.453
Baby Huey. What's good?

04:11.521 --> 04:12.788
What's the matter with you, huh?

04:12.856 --> 04:14.189
We got a situation.

04:14.257 --> 04:15.524
I've been calling you
like you owe me money.

04:15.592 --> 04:17.026
What are you talking about?
I didn't hear my phone.

04:17.093 --> 04:18.226
Called you like five, six times.

04:18.295 --> 04:19.495
I believe you.
I didn't hear my phone,

04:19.562 --> 04:21.196
I left it right over here.
Where's my phone?

04:21.264 --> 04:23.249
You see my phone?

04:25.268 --> 04:27.436
Oh. Oh... sorry.

04:28.838 --> 04:30.289
You didn't feel that vibrating?

04:30.373 --> 04:31.573
Ever?

04:31.641 --> 04:33.742
Oh, that's what it was.

04:33.810 --> 04:34.877
Here.

04:34.945 --> 04:37.296
You keep it.
You sure?

04:37.380 --> 04:39.148
Yeah. You keep it.

04:43.286 --> 04:44.687
It's an armored car heist.

04:44.754 --> 04:46.555
Two dead,
one hanging by a thread.

04:46.622 --> 04:49.141
Kid's name is Jordan Townsend.
He's 25.

04:49.225 --> 04:51.093
This kid looks like he's 12.

04:51.144 --> 04:52.494
What else we got?

04:52.562 --> 04:54.596
Eyewitnesses say
everything happened real fast.

04:54.664 --> 04:55.731
All they can remember
is that the shooters

04:55.798 --> 04:56.865
were dressed like painters.

04:56.933 --> 04:59.268
Some say there were two,
some say there were ten.

04:59.319 --> 05:01.403
You know how that goes.

05:01.471 --> 05:03.572
Carl. Get these kids
out of here, huh?

05:03.640 --> 05:05.807
- So where's the truck?
- They jacked it.

05:05.859 --> 05:07.743
They jacked it?
Doesn't seem suspect to you?

05:07.811 --> 05:08.994
Why not just take the cash?

05:09.079 --> 05:10.829
Maybe our cowboys
needed a horse.

05:10.914 --> 05:12.147
Yeah, maybe, but driving around

05:12.198 --> 05:14.583
in a stolen armored car's
not exactly stealth.

05:14.650 --> 05:16.518
They were able
to disable the GPS.

05:16.586 --> 05:18.487
We're still
looking for it.

05:18.538 --> 05:20.789
Downtown Waikiki,
broad daylight...

05:20.840 --> 05:23.258
Obviously no regard
for human life.

05:23.326 --> 05:24.843
This is a bold crew.

05:24.928 --> 05:26.729
All right, Chin, contact
the HPD and the TSA.

05:26.796 --> 05:28.830
Tell them we're looking for
anybody trying to travel with

05:28.882 --> 05:31.033
or unload a large amount of cash.
Yeah.

05:31.101 --> 05:32.334
All right, don't cancel
your lunch plans--

05:32.402 --> 05:33.469
we might be wrapping this one up
sooner than you think.

05:33.520 --> 05:34.836
Really?

05:34.888 --> 05:36.221
Yeah. I just talked
to the company rep.

05:36.306 --> 05:39.274
Aeko Kula Security tags each bag
of cash with a tracking device.

05:39.342 --> 05:40.776
Cash is LoJacked.

05:40.843 --> 05:43.145
Yeah. It's all part of some
new secret security protocol

05:43.213 --> 05:44.747
that started
a couple weeks ago.

05:44.814 --> 05:46.148
And you know what?
We have a hit.

05:47.283 --> 05:49.401
All we got to do now
is follow the money.

05:59.963 --> 06:01.630
Are you sure this is the place?

06:01.697 --> 06:04.633
Yeah, the signal from the cash
is coming from right here.

06:14.310 --> 06:15.477
Anyone up for a swim?

06:15.545 --> 06:17.479
Ah, forgot to bring
my board shorts.

06:17.547 --> 06:19.881
Looks like the rookie
is going swimming.

06:19.933 --> 06:21.216
I'll go in with you.

06:21.267 --> 06:24.186
Very nice of you.

06:38.251 --> 06:39.768
Sure you don't want
to come for a swim?

06:39.836 --> 06:42.805
No, you go ahead, uh...
with your pants.

06:42.872 --> 06:44.540
I'll just be here
with a dry towel.

06:54.750 --> 06:56.969
You know, you can create
shortcuts on that thing.

06:57.053 --> 06:59.221
Type a letter and it'll
finish the word for you.

06:59.272 --> 07:00.889
Just for the words
you use a lot.

07:00.957 --> 07:02.591
Well, then, I'd have
to seriously consider

07:02.659 --> 07:03.925
the words I use a lot.

07:05.462 --> 07:07.096
That you would.

07:12.836 --> 07:14.036
We found the money.

07:14.104 --> 07:15.287
And the truck.

07:15.371 --> 07:17.289
They drove it
right off the pier.

07:17.373 --> 07:19.975
That was pretty smart.

07:20.043 --> 07:21.410
Without the tracking device
in the cash,

07:21.478 --> 07:22.628
we might never have found it.

07:22.712 --> 07:24.613
Uh, no chance the shooters
are in there, right?

07:24.681 --> 07:26.448
Trunk was empty,
doors were open.

07:26.499 --> 07:29.451
I get dumping the truck,
but why the money?

07:30.920 --> 07:33.639
Maybe this heist
wasn't about the money.

07:45.566 --> 07:49.690
Takes a very specific type of
psycho to jack an armored truck.

07:49.691 --> 07:51.625
You've got guys with vests,
guns already drawn...

07:51.676 --> 07:53.427
Yeah, maybe they get
a rush from it.

07:53.494 --> 07:54.795
Psychos.

07:54.846 --> 07:56.430
All right.

07:56.497 --> 07:58.515
Oh, what is that?
Seaweed?

07:58.600 --> 08:00.017
- Yeah, seaweed.
- Oh. Oh!

08:00.101 --> 08:01.802
Yeah, we'll...
we'll take the front.

08:01.853 --> 08:03.337
All right, see what
these guys left behind.

08:03.404 --> 08:04.571
Besides the money.

08:09.110 --> 08:10.310
Hey, they ripped up the dash,

08:10.361 --> 08:11.945
like they were trying
to look for something.

08:12.013 --> 08:14.031
Yeah, these trucks come equipped
with a smart black box.

08:14.115 --> 08:16.016
Kinda like a flight
recorder on a plane.

08:16.067 --> 08:18.035
Records every move on video.

08:18.119 --> 08:20.153
Yeah, the Aeko Kula rep
said 24 hours' worth.

08:20.204 --> 08:21.555
Could be useful to us.

08:24.242 --> 08:25.993
Yeah, if they didn't
put a bullet in it first.

08:27.295 --> 08:28.695
You could fix that,
though, right, cuz?

08:29.881 --> 08:33.366
Little elbow grease
and a prayer... maybe.

08:35.587 --> 08:38.005
Mask, broken strap.

08:38.056 --> 08:40.057
- This the only one back there?
- Yeah.

08:40.140 --> 08:41.541
Maybe there was a struggle.
It got caught on something.

08:41.592 --> 08:43.309
Wait a minute. Paramedic
said that the guard

08:43.376 --> 08:45.345
who was still alive, he had
defensive wounds on his hands.

08:45.396 --> 08:47.047
So he tried to
rip a mask off...

08:47.098 --> 08:48.915
Maybe he saw a face.

08:51.452 --> 08:53.020
<i>What are the odds, huh?</i>

08:53.087 --> 08:54.404
<i>Guy gets a bullet in the dome,</i>

08:54.489 --> 08:56.456
goes through four hours
of brain surgery,

08:56.524 --> 08:57.908
and he survives,

08:57.992 --> 08:59.242
yet 150 people
die every year

08:59.327 --> 09:00.427
from falling coconuts.

09:01.578 --> 09:03.234
It's a fact.
I read it online.

09:03.235 --> 09:05.341
What, so now you're not going to
let Grace go near coconut trees?

09:05.342 --> 09:07.227
Not without a helmet, I'm not.

09:07.311 --> 09:09.312
Hi.

09:13.851 --> 09:15.018
Excuse me.

09:15.085 --> 09:16.519
Uh, Camille Townsend?

09:16.570 --> 09:18.788
Yes.

09:18.855 --> 09:20.223
Hey, uh, I'm Steve McGarrett,
from Five-O.

09:20.291 --> 09:21.724
This is my partner,
Detective Danny Williams.

09:21.792 --> 09:23.159
We're investigating
the shooting.

09:23.210 --> 09:24.761
We're really sorry about
what happened to your husband.

09:26.046 --> 09:27.664
I warned him
not to take that job.

09:27.715 --> 09:29.465
That it was too dangerous,
but...

09:29.533 --> 09:31.367
he didn't listen to me.

09:31.435 --> 09:35.838
We've been together
since we were 18.

09:35.906 --> 09:37.907
I just don't know how
to be me without him.

09:37.975 --> 09:40.009
Hey. You're not going
to have to worry about that.

09:40.060 --> 09:41.678
Doctor said that he's strong,

09:41.745 --> 09:43.846
and he's going to pull through,
so you got to be strong, too.

09:48.419 --> 09:53.356
I heard that the other
two men... didn't make it.

09:53.424 --> 09:54.657
No. They didn't.

09:54.725 --> 09:56.726
Your husband might be
the only witness to this crime,

09:56.794 --> 09:58.995
so at some stage
we're hoping we can talk to him.

09:59.063 --> 10:01.331
Yeah, obviously it's the last
thing on your mind right now,

10:01.398 --> 10:03.766
but if you could,
when he wakes up,

10:03.834 --> 10:05.268
please, give us a call.
Of course.

10:06.903 --> 10:08.905
It was his first day.

10:08.973 --> 10:10.139
Hey, listen. We're going to do

10:10.207 --> 10:11.774
everything we can to
find out who did this

10:11.842 --> 10:13.793
to him, and to you, all right?

10:19.149 --> 10:21.784
<i>Pulled this from the security</i>
<i>cam at the loading dock.</i>

10:22.819 --> 10:24.861
There are four shooters.

10:24.862 --> 10:26.396
This is the best frame we have.

10:27.470 --> 10:28.947
Not much to go on.

10:28.949 --> 10:30.387
All right,
they knew we'd pull video.

10:30.388 --> 10:32.089
That's why they're wearing masks
and coveralls.

10:32.157 --> 10:35.059
Exactly. Also not helpful
is a group of painters

10:35.126 --> 10:38.429
standing nearby, dressed
exactly like our thieves.

10:38.496 --> 10:39.963
Probably not a coincidence.
Right.

10:40.015 --> 10:42.066
So I put the video through
our facial recognition software,

10:42.133 --> 10:45.569
and I got a hit
from the HPD mug shot database.

10:45.637 --> 10:46.820
Gordon Smith.

10:46.905 --> 10:48.639
Prior for two home robberies,

10:48.707 --> 10:50.107
got out of Halawa
six months ago.

10:50.175 --> 10:51.942
I talked to his
parole officer,

10:52.010 --> 10:53.410
who said he missed
today's meeting.

10:53.478 --> 10:54.945
Okay. Um...

10:55.013 --> 10:56.213
I'm not a rocket scientist,

10:56.281 --> 10:58.415
but I think I know why
he missed his meeting.

10:58.483 --> 11:00.951
All right, well, let's set
a meeting he won't miss.

11:01.019 --> 11:03.003
Hey, hey, hey, man!

11:03.088 --> 11:04.622
What are you doing, man?
I didn't do nothing.

11:04.689 --> 11:06.323
How'd you even find me?

11:06.391 --> 11:08.025
Oh, your P.O. told us.
You remember him?

11:08.093 --> 11:09.593
He's the guy
that you were supposed

11:09.661 --> 11:11.262
to see this morning,
but didn't,

11:11.329 --> 11:14.398
therefore, you violated
your parole. Huh?

11:14.466 --> 11:16.400
So they sent
Five-0 after me?

11:17.936 --> 11:19.520
No, we don't care
about that.

11:19.604 --> 11:20.604
No, we don't, Gordon,

11:20.672 --> 11:22.273
but what we care
very much about

11:22.340 --> 11:23.340
is why you missed
your appointment.

11:23.408 --> 11:25.376
So please tell me, tell me,

11:25.443 --> 11:27.194
when did you go
from boosting laptops

11:27.279 --> 11:29.012
to capping people in
the back of the head?

11:29.064 --> 11:30.981
I don't know
what you talking about.

11:31.032 --> 11:32.650
That's not true. You were there.
Where?

11:32.701 --> 11:35.185
Don't play dumb, Gordon.
I hate that.

11:35.253 --> 11:37.021
It's a personal pet peeve
of mine, all right?

11:37.088 --> 11:38.789
You were at Fort and King
at 8:00 a.m. this morning, okay?

11:38.856 --> 11:40.958
We have you on camera while

11:41.026 --> 11:42.409
an armored truck heist
is going down.

11:42.494 --> 11:45.262
Look, man, I went straight in
the joint and found the Lord.

11:45.330 --> 11:46.830
I didn't do nothing wrong.

11:46.881 --> 11:48.632
All I did was answer an ad.

11:48.700 --> 11:49.700
What ad?

11:49.751 --> 11:50.834
Gavinslist

11:50.902 --> 11:52.136
for paint work.

11:52.203 --> 11:53.721
They said meet there
wearing a white jumpsuit,

11:53.805 --> 11:54.805
a hat, dust mask.

11:54.873 --> 11:56.540
Offering $30 an hour,
cash money.

11:56.591 --> 11:58.208
I figured my P.O.

11:58.260 --> 12:01.545
would be all right if I miss
our meeting for a job.

12:01.613 --> 12:03.013
Who's the meet with?

12:03.081 --> 12:05.349
I don't know.

12:05.417 --> 12:06.650
No one ever showed.

12:06.718 --> 12:08.385
Left me standing there
with a bunch of other dudes.

12:08.436 --> 12:11.088
Then people started shooting,
so I took off.

12:11.156 --> 12:12.156
All right, go over there.

12:12.223 --> 12:13.691
Don't give me
a look.

12:13.742 --> 12:14.959
I need some privacy.

12:17.712 --> 12:19.496
- The ad was a fake.
- Yeah.

12:19.564 --> 12:20.898
Our shooters didn't want
a group of painters.

12:20.966 --> 12:22.766
They wanted a bunch
of guys at the site

12:22.834 --> 12:24.368
wearing exactly the same thing.

12:24.436 --> 12:27.104
A bunch of clones
to create mass confusion.

12:27.172 --> 12:28.339
That's it.

12:28.406 --> 12:30.007
I think I'm gonna enjoy
catching these guys.

12:30.075 --> 12:32.376
<i>We need to find out</i>

12:32.444 --> 12:34.912
when that Gavinslist ad
was posted and by whom.

12:34.980 --> 12:37.681
Chin, you get anything
off the box?

12:37.749 --> 12:39.550
Well, I got what used
to be something.

12:39.601 --> 12:41.185
When our friend shot up
the black box

12:41.252 --> 12:43.253
it damaged the SD card
that holds all the video.

12:43.305 --> 12:45.022
I'm trying to get it out
without making it worse,

12:45.090 --> 12:46.223
but it's slow going.

12:46.291 --> 12:47.308
Ballistics came back.

12:47.392 --> 12:48.809
It turns out the same guns
were used

12:48.893 --> 12:50.761
at a Waikiki bank heist
a year ago.

12:50.812 --> 12:52.396
Four perps wearing masks.

12:52.464 --> 12:53.681
What was the target?

12:53.748 --> 12:55.766
The internal vault
at Oahu Federal Bank.

12:55.834 --> 12:57.134
They killed two guards.

12:57.202 --> 12:58.935
Got away with close
to $4 million.

12:58.987 --> 13:00.371
Wow. Any suspects?

13:00.438 --> 13:01.605
No. Unfortunately,
it happened during

13:01.673 --> 13:03.490
the annual Koko Crater
Classic Triathlon.

13:03.575 --> 13:05.209
Streets were closed.

13:05.276 --> 13:06.744
HPD was spread thin.

13:06.795 --> 13:08.412
No one even knows how
they got in or out.

13:08.480 --> 13:10.748
But I ran the stats through
an FBI database,

13:10.815 --> 13:13.050
and in the last year, there have
been high-end, four-person robberies

13:13.118 --> 13:15.386
in Boulder,
San Diego and Austin.

13:15.453 --> 13:16.420
Wait a minute.

13:16.488 --> 13:18.155
All cities that host triathlons.

13:18.223 --> 13:20.758
Bingo. And the heists always
happen during the race.

13:20.809 --> 13:23.010
Okay, so this is their M.O.

13:23.094 --> 13:26.263
They use an event like this
as a diversion.

13:26.331 --> 13:28.599
Guys, this city shuts down
for the triathlon tomorrow.

13:30.168 --> 13:32.736
Okay, all right, if we're right,

13:32.804 --> 13:34.905
this crew is probably
planning another hit,

13:34.973 --> 13:37.974
which means we have,
like, 18 hours before

13:38.026 --> 13:40.160
somebody else is gonna
wind up dead.

13:40.245 --> 13:41.662
Okay. Thank you very much.

13:41.746 --> 13:43.030
- Who's that?
- Camille Townsend.

13:43.114 --> 13:44.748
Jordan's awake and he's talking.

13:44.816 --> 13:46.984
Let's hope he can
I.D. a shooter.

13:53.191 --> 13:55.459
Ah...

13:56.561 --> 13:56.561
Come On.

13:58.496 --> 14:00.464
What is with you today?
Your phone is blowing up.

14:00.515 --> 14:02.466
It's Rachel, all right?

14:02.517 --> 14:05.169
The lawyers have decided that
since we "activate each other,"

14:05.236 --> 14:07.337
that e-mail would be a better
form of communication.

14:07.405 --> 14:09.807
Except I hate e-mail.
I'm never sitting at a computer,

14:09.874 --> 14:12.409
and I can't type on this thing
'cause I got goofy thumbs.

14:12.477 --> 14:14.144
Why don't you try
turning it sideways?

14:14.212 --> 14:15.479
What's that gonna do?

14:15.547 --> 14:17.281
It makes the things bigger.
I'm just trying to help.

14:17.348 --> 14:18.615
Commander McGarrett,
Detective Williams,

14:18.683 --> 14:20.784
I'm Meredith Michaels,
Channel 9 News.

14:20.852 --> 14:22.632
Do you have any leads
on the armored car heist?

14:22.657 --> 14:24.087
No comment.

14:24.137 --> 14:25.060
What is the press
even doing here?

14:25.061 --> 14:26.362
We're going live in ten minutes.

14:26.428 --> 14:28.196
I'm hoping to get a comment
from Jordan Townsend,

14:28.263 --> 14:29.397
the surviving guard.

14:29.465 --> 14:32.200
Okay, turn that off,
please, all right?

14:32.268 --> 14:33.902
Jordan Townsend is
a potential witness

14:33.969 --> 14:35.370
for a double
homicide, okay?

14:35.437 --> 14:36.654
The people that did this,

14:36.739 --> 14:38.940
they do not want him to talk.
You understand that?

14:38.991 --> 14:41.609
You putting his name out there,
it only puts his safety at risk.

14:41.660 --> 14:43.211
Jordan's condition was reported

14:43.278 --> 14:45.880
from the crime scene
three hours ago.

14:47.316 --> 14:49.951
Room 218, Code Blue.

14:50.019 --> 14:52.253
Code Blue, room 218.

14:52.321 --> 14:54.556
The doctor said everything
was fine. I just went

14:54.623 --> 14:56.724
and got some coffee.
What happened in five minutes?

15:00.129 --> 15:02.981
Did you catch that?

15:03.065 --> 15:04.632
Yeah, why is he
wearing a mask?

15:04.700 --> 15:07.135
Hey, excuse me,
Doctor. Doctor?

15:07.203 --> 15:09.153
Sir, sir, I'm talking...

15:19.048 --> 15:20.448
Be my eyes.

15:24.019 --> 15:25.019
Okay, three...

15:27.089 --> 15:28.823
...four...

15:28.874 --> 15:30.341
five...

15:30.426 --> 15:31.843
Five. He stopped at five.

15:50.284 --> 15:51.201
Hey, tell me something.

15:51.285 --> 15:52.285
Who can outrun an elevator

15:52.353 --> 15:54.020
going hand over
hand up a cable?

15:54.072 --> 15:55.522
Besides you? I have no idea.

15:55.590 --> 15:57.290
I got the whole hospital
on lockdown.

15:57.358 --> 15:58.959
Yeah, but without a face,
we don't know

15:59.026 --> 16:00.028
who we're looking for.

16:00.053 --> 16:02.426
I got two uniforms
at Jordan's door

16:02.427 --> 16:04.589
and I got security
at every exit.

16:04.590 --> 16:05.523
Still nothing.

16:05.591 --> 16:06.557
How's Jordan?

16:06.625 --> 16:08.693
Doctor said he suffered.
an embolism.

16:08.760 --> 16:11.729
Took air through a
syringe through his IV.

16:11.797 --> 16:13.397
He's unconscious. They're
looking after him right now.

16:13.465 --> 16:14.799
What about Camille?

16:14.867 --> 16:16.033
Her husband almost died
twice today.

16:16.101 --> 16:17.468
What do you think?

16:17.536 --> 16:19.453
I think if Jordan was targeted,
he must've seen something.

16:20.572 --> 16:21.539
Kono.

16:21.606 --> 16:23.274
That Gavinslist ad for painters?

16:23.342 --> 16:25.076
I tracked down the IP address
through a WiFi router.

16:25.143 --> 16:26.610
It was posted

16:26.662 --> 16:29.614
from a chiropractor's office
in Kaimuki.

16:38.323 --> 16:40.258
Clear.
Clear here.

16:46.999 --> 16:48.132
I got blood!

16:48.200 --> 16:50.768
Yeah, me too.

16:53.272 --> 16:55.656
Building manager said
Dr. Kinkirk's been out

16:55.741 --> 16:57.441
of town for the
last three weeks.

16:57.509 --> 16:59.076
Had no idea the office
even had people in it.

16:59.144 --> 17:01.279
- Is that blood?
- Yeah.

17:01.330 --> 17:02.580
Looks like our guys
are dopers.

17:02.648 --> 17:03.831
What? What does
that mean?

17:03.916 --> 17:05.849
You draw a pint
of your own blood,

17:05.917 --> 17:07.785
your store it in the fridge, and
then you reinject it days later.

17:07.853 --> 17:09.587
Why, what for?

17:09.655 --> 17:11.055
Increases your red cell count

17:11.123 --> 17:13.723
and it allows your muscles to
work harder for up to 12 hours.

17:13.791 --> 17:15.226
Some SEALs in Coronado
would do it

17:15.294 --> 17:17.295
before their underwater drills.

17:17.346 --> 17:18.529
Kinda like
an all-natural steroid.

17:18.597 --> 17:19.663
Yeah, for vampires.

17:19.714 --> 17:21.324
Or ultra-endurance
athletes.

17:22.923 --> 17:24.781
If these guys are dopers,
maybe our shooters

17:24.781 --> 17:26.148
are gonna be in the triathlon
for real.

17:26.217 --> 17:28.752
It would explain the Tarzan
stuff in the elevator.

17:28.819 --> 17:31.020
It's a perfect alibi.
You pull a heist

17:31.088 --> 17:32.789
in the middle, you still finish
the race, but you claim to have

17:32.857 --> 17:34.758
been in the race
the whole time. It's perfect.

17:34.825 --> 17:36.325
Where's he go...?

17:36.377 --> 17:37.794
Where are you going?

17:39.363 --> 17:42.599
Oh, they got a cleaning crew
for that, babe.

17:42.666 --> 17:44.551
Do you need help?

17:45.870 --> 17:48.688
Oh! Oh, I get it!

17:48.773 --> 17:49.773
Steve the Science guy
is back.

17:49.840 --> 17:52.525
I need a print.

17:54.111 --> 17:56.362
Boss, I have a print kit
in my car.

17:56.447 --> 17:58.364
There's no time.

18:06.857 --> 18:08.675
Yeah, I got the print.
I'm running it now.

18:08.743 --> 18:10.193
Okay, did you get anything
off the SD card

18:10.261 --> 18:11.360
from the black box?

18:11.412 --> 18:12.796
After all that, it's empty

18:12.863 --> 18:14.164
as in brand-new.

18:14.215 --> 18:16.099
The thieves must've switched it
out with the real one

18:16.167 --> 18:17.333
before they shot up the box.

18:17.401 --> 18:18.334
I don't understand.

18:18.385 --> 18:19.869
Why go to all the trouble?

18:19.920 --> 18:21.037
Probably for the same reason

18:21.105 --> 18:22.472
they drove the truck
off the pier;

18:22.540 --> 18:23.807
they want to slow us down
and create another diversion.

18:23.874 --> 18:25.374
They weren't just covering
their tracks.

18:25.426 --> 18:27.510
They were covering
what they stole.

18:27.561 --> 18:29.813
They wanted the video off
that card.

18:29.880 --> 18:31.564
Yeah, but what for?

18:31.649 --> 18:32.932
I asked myself
the same question.

18:33.000 --> 18:34.984
So I pulled the video off
another truck in

18:35.052 --> 18:36.152
Aeko Kula's fleet.

18:36.220 --> 18:37.520
Their cameras cover
four different angles

18:37.571 --> 18:40.273
including the driver's side
and the front.

18:40.357 --> 18:43.193
Okay, so they got video footage
of what, entry points,

18:43.260 --> 18:45.779
of gates... Wait a minute.

18:45.863 --> 18:49.532
They've also got a peek at every
pass code on that truck's route.

18:49.600 --> 18:51.901
The video was the whole reason
they stole the truck.

18:51.969 --> 18:54.204
This whole thing is recon
for their next hit.

18:54.271 --> 18:56.139
I mean, having that information
is almost as good

18:56.207 --> 18:57.207
as having the keys.

18:57.258 --> 18:58.541
Chin, we need

18:58.609 --> 19:01.144
to break down all the stops
on Jordan's route, okay,

19:01.212 --> 19:02.912
and start narrowing in
on potential targets.

19:04.448 --> 19:07.050
Hey, I just got a hit from the
fingerprint on the blood bag.

19:07.117 --> 19:09.519
It's a local guy
named Kai Rollins.

19:09.587 --> 19:11.554
He's in the system for a string
of liquor store robberies.

19:11.605 --> 19:12.822
All right, where do we find him?

19:14.425 --> 19:15.592
You need a
spot, Kai?

19:15.659 --> 19:16.693
Nah, I got it.

19:16.760 --> 19:17.927
Come on. I insist.

19:18.896 --> 19:20.063
Can I help you?

19:20.114 --> 19:21.464
Let's talk story.

19:21.532 --> 19:23.566
First thing I want to know is

19:23.617 --> 19:24.901
what you were doing
at Kinkirk's Chiropractic?

19:24.969 --> 19:25.935
Never heard of it.

19:26.003 --> 19:27.637
I think you have.

19:29.974 --> 19:31.440
Fo'real?

19:33.344 --> 19:35.044
What is a human life worth

19:35.112 --> 19:37.881
to you, Kai?
$25,000? $35,000?

19:37.948 --> 19:39.048
$45,000?
Half a million? What?

19:39.116 --> 19:40.166
Personally, I think
it's relative.

19:40.251 --> 19:42.485
I mean, every human life
has got to be worth

19:42.553 --> 19:44.287
a different
amount, right?

19:44.338 --> 19:45.622
Stop!

19:45.689 --> 19:47.724
Stop what? You want
some more weight?

19:47.791 --> 19:48.925
What'd he say?

19:48.993 --> 19:50.159
We'll put more weight.

19:50.227 --> 19:52.095
More weight.

19:53.564 --> 19:55.815
That should be easy
for you, right?

19:55.900 --> 19:57.300
You got that extra
pint of blood

19:57.368 --> 19:58.568
pumping through your veins.

19:58.636 --> 19:59.602
Give you
that big boost.

19:59.670 --> 20:00.770
Is this about the doping?

20:00.821 --> 20:02.939
No, it's about jacking
an armored car

20:03.007 --> 20:04.741
and shooting three people.
Your fingerprints,

20:04.808 --> 20:06.809
they're on a blood bag
at a doctor's office.

20:06.861 --> 20:11.281
Look, my girlfriend does
housekeeping for that building.

20:11.348 --> 20:15.484
Dr. Kinkirk travels a lot,
so I use the office sometimes

20:15.536 --> 20:17.670
to supply doping equipment
to the triathletes.

20:20.090 --> 20:21.524
Help them draw blood.

20:22.877 --> 20:24.694
You might have found
one of my bags,

20:24.762 --> 20:26.930
but I don't know anything
about...

20:26.997 --> 20:29.499
an armored car heist.

20:29.567 --> 20:31.501
I need a name, Kai.
I mean,

20:31.569 --> 20:33.770
group of four--
see what you can remember.

20:33.837 --> 20:36.005
There was a woman.

20:37.041 --> 20:39.609
Sabrina something.

20:39.677 --> 20:41.344
Lives local.

20:41.412 --> 20:43.980
Needed supplies for four.

20:44.048 --> 20:45.148
What do
you think?

20:45.215 --> 20:46.149
It's something.

20:46.200 --> 20:47.850
A woman named Sabrina, Kai.

20:49.737 --> 20:52.055
Taut, buddy.
Real taut.

20:57.762 --> 20:59.018
<i>You know, I just had a thought.</i>

20:59.019 --> 21:00.302
Don't hurt yourself.

21:00.370 --> 21:01.470
That's funny.

21:01.521 --> 21:03.739
We're going
after this Sabrina person

21:03.807 --> 21:06.392
based on-on the statement
of a meathead.

21:06.476 --> 21:07.526
Well, she's the
only Sabrina

21:07.611 --> 21:09.645
on the triathlon roster
who lives on the island.

21:09.713 --> 21:10.646
That's true.

21:10.714 --> 21:11.780
Matches his
description.

21:11.848 --> 21:12.781
Why, what are you getting at?

21:12.849 --> 21:14.283
Well, we have
Gordon on tape

21:14.351 --> 21:16.351
at the crime scene,
we have Kai's fingerprints.

21:16.403 --> 21:18.821
All this lady did was go out
and buy some medical supplies

21:18.888 --> 21:20.155
and enter a triathlon.

21:20.206 --> 21:22.024
Last time I checked,
neither of those are illegal.

21:22.075 --> 21:23.709
We can't go knock
down her door

21:23.793 --> 21:25.527
and pin her to the ground,
you know what I mean?

21:25.579 --> 21:27.195
Okay, is there a plan of
attack in there somewhere?

21:27.247 --> 21:28.196
Absolutely.

21:28.248 --> 21:29.214
We sit on her,
we wait,

21:29.299 --> 21:30.749
we see who comes,
we see who goes.

21:30.834 --> 21:32.134
I mean, we got three accomplices
we're looking for,

21:32.201 --> 21:33.552
right?
Right.

21:33.637 --> 21:35.704
Well, Danny, these people use
bystanders for target practice,

21:35.772 --> 21:38.140
okay, and if they are using
the race as a cover,

21:38.208 --> 21:39.558
then we only have 14 hours

21:39.643 --> 21:41.076
before they pull
their next heist.

21:41.144 --> 21:42.177
Exactly-- without hard evidence,

21:42.245 --> 21:43.812
we need to catch 'em in the act

21:43.880 --> 21:45.314
or else we're going
to spook 'em, scare 'em,

21:45.381 --> 21:46.548
and then we won't
catch 'em at all.

21:46.600 --> 21:48.216
Why are you going this way?

21:48.268 --> 21:50.319
This is the street where
Sabrina James rents a house.

21:50.386 --> 21:52.688
Kono pulled the information
off her triathlon application.

21:52.756 --> 21:55.658
The house is rented to a
Seth James, her husband.

21:55.725 --> 21:57.576
- Check your e-mail.
- E-mail.

21:57.661 --> 21:59.928
I know. I know.
Turn it sideways.

22:10.807 --> 22:14.243
Okay. Uh, so you realize
we can't see anything.

22:14.311 --> 22:15.577
I know.

22:15.645 --> 22:17.279
Mm-hmm. Not
exactly optimal

22:17.347 --> 22:19.098
for our, uh, "Let's
sit on them" plan.

22:19.182 --> 22:21.250
I just said I know.

22:21.318 --> 22:23.018
- Why are you so angry?
- Because I am an angry person.

22:23.086 --> 22:24.553
Okay? Can you just pull up?

22:24.621 --> 22:25.854
Please.

22:25.922 --> 22:27.756
To where? This is their house.

22:27.824 --> 22:29.858
Just, please, okay?
I know somebody.

22:29.926 --> 22:31.777
Please.

22:47.477 --> 22:49.078
Danny, what are you doing here?

22:49.129 --> 22:51.914
- Uh, I need a favor.
- How did you even get in the gate?

22:51.981 --> 22:53.949
Because he code
is still Grace's birthday.

22:54.017 --> 22:55.484
I told you to change it
15,000 times,

22:55.552 --> 22:56.652
but you don't
listen to me.

22:56.720 --> 22:57.920
So, perhaps,
you'd care to explain

22:57.987 --> 22:59.788
what it is you're doing
on my front porch

22:59.856 --> 23:01.490
and who your friend
is with the luggage.

23:01.558 --> 23:03.258
Uh, this is my partner,
Steve McGarrett.

23:03.326 --> 23:06.795
Steve, this is
my lovely ex-wife, Rachel.

23:10.366 --> 23:11.985
<i>Absolutely not.</i>

23:11.986 --> 23:13.286
<i>Okay, then I'll just</i>
<i>talk to Stanley.</i>

23:13.354 --> 23:14.487
Okay, he's a goof,

23:14.555 --> 23:15.922
but at least he'll listen to reason.
Stanley!

23:16.408 --> 23:18.604
Stan is on a business trip
to Indonesia.

23:18.604 --> 23:19.803
You know,
I knew that you

23:19.855 --> 23:22.824
would find a way to engage
with me while he was gone.

23:22.908 --> 23:24.909
Okay, this has nothing to do
with you and I.

23:24.977 --> 23:26.544
You have potential murder
suspects living next door.

23:26.612 --> 23:29.213
We just need access
so we can surveil.

23:29.281 --> 23:30.331
Surveil?

23:30.415 --> 23:31.582
Yeah. Yeah, surveil,

23:31.650 --> 23:33.017
and then we'll be
out of your hair.

23:33.085 --> 23:34.385
Trust me--
they're bad people.

23:34.453 --> 23:36.521
You don't want them walking
around your neighborhood.

23:36.588 --> 23:38.789
You got Grace
and, you know...

23:38.857 --> 23:40.791
Have you noticed anything
unusual about their behavior?

23:40.859 --> 23:42.326
Not unusual.

23:42.394 --> 23:44.328
I think they moved in
a few months ago.

23:44.379 --> 23:45.996
They're renters.

23:46.048 --> 23:48.199
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Nothing.

23:48.267 --> 23:50.218
Just that they're only here
for a short time.

23:50.302 --> 23:51.769
They tend to keep to themselves.

23:53.639 --> 23:56.541
Sorry. You had
a rather large chip there.

23:56.608 --> 23:57.841
Ah.
Okay, Rachel, I know

23:57.893 --> 24:00.244
that this isn't ideal,
but we don't have much time

24:00.312 --> 24:02.180
and we need your help.

24:03.815 --> 24:06.817
Very well. The two of you
can do what you like.

24:06.885 --> 24:09.520
I'm picking Grace up from school
and checking into a hotel.

24:09.571 --> 24:11.489
Uh, you can't do that.

24:11.540 --> 24:13.057
I'm not your suspect.
I understand that,

24:13.125 --> 24:14.926
but we all just need
to act normal.

24:14.993 --> 24:16.911
Uh, if you start
breaking routines,

24:16.995 --> 24:18.162
they may get suspicious.

24:18.213 --> 24:19.863
Oh, Rachel,
I got an idea.

24:19.915 --> 24:22.550
Why don't you take Gracie over
to Laura's for a sleepover,

24:22.634 --> 24:25.169
'cause she's only been asking
for, like, three months.

24:25.237 --> 24:26.604
And I'm supposed
to just stay here?

24:26.672 --> 24:28.172
I'm not thrilled
about the situation, either.

24:28.223 --> 24:29.874
This-- no.

24:29.942 --> 24:32.343
So, uh, if it's
all good, we'll, uh,

24:32.394 --> 24:34.478
find a spot upstairs,
and we can get

24:34.546 --> 24:37.098
a good vantage point
on the house next door and...

24:37.182 --> 24:38.983
get to work.

24:41.737 --> 24:43.688
This is...
this is ridiculous, okay?

24:43.755 --> 24:45.323
Nobody needs a bed this big.

24:45.390 --> 24:48.259
I mean, my whole apartment
could fit into this bed frame.

24:48.327 --> 24:50.294
It's over compensation.
It's... it's absurd.

24:50.362 --> 24:53.030
I mean, this room-- it does
have the best view, Danny.

24:53.081 --> 24:54.999
You're having fun with this?
You're enjoying this?

24:55.067 --> 24:56.601
I want to rip my face off,

24:56.668 --> 24:57.735
and you're
enjoying this?

24:59.304 --> 25:00.738
Would anyone like tea?

25:00.789 --> 25:02.773
Do not mock me, Daniel.

25:02.841 --> 25:04.542
I wasn't mocking you.
I wasn't mocking you.

25:04.610 --> 25:06.277
I think it's cute.
We're doing a stakeout,

25:06.345 --> 25:08.379
and you're
offering teatime.

25:08.447 --> 25:09.714
It's called civilization.

25:09.765 --> 25:11.282
Would you care for anything,

25:11.350 --> 25:12.917
Commander McGarrett?
No, thank you, Rachel.

25:12.985 --> 25:15.486
Um, but could you tell me
how many people live next door?

25:15.554 --> 25:17.088
Just a couple.
So two?

25:17.155 --> 25:19.090
Last I checked,
that's what a couple was.

25:19.157 --> 25:21.125
Mm-hmm. That's cute.

25:21.193 --> 25:22.960
Oh, you know what we should do?

25:23.028 --> 25:24.562
Uh, we're about
to take them down,

25:24.630 --> 25:26.230
so maybe beforehand,
we invite them over

25:26.281 --> 25:27.965
for a game of tennis--
tea and tennis.

25:28.033 --> 25:29.267
Bite me.

25:30.836 --> 25:32.303
That's very civilized.

25:32.371 --> 25:34.939
She's cool, man.

25:35.007 --> 25:37.408
She's cool. I don't
know how you got her.

25:37.459 --> 25:38.743
How did I get her?

25:38.794 --> 25:40.511
Hey. I am a good catch.

25:40.579 --> 25:42.513
No, really, how'd you get her?

25:43.849 --> 25:46.283
Seriously, uh, she hit me.

25:46.335 --> 25:48.002
- She hit you?
- Yeah.

25:48.086 --> 25:49.286
She hit you with what?
With her fists?

25:49.338 --> 25:50.421
Like in the face?

25:50.489 --> 25:52.323
No, no, no.
She, uh...

25:52.391 --> 25:54.925
she was new
to the States, and, uh,

25:54.993 --> 25:57.828
she wasn't used to driving
on the right side of the road.

25:57.896 --> 25:59.313
And, um, she saw a cop car

25:59.398 --> 26:00.848
and she got flustered,
so she rear-ended me.

26:00.932 --> 26:02.600
All right,
so I get out of the car,

26:02.651 --> 26:04.101
and I offered to give her
driving lessons

26:04.169 --> 26:06.103
instead of giving her
a ticket.

26:06.171 --> 26:07.304
Pretty smooth, bud.

26:07.356 --> 26:10.408
Yeah, well, I was just...
just being nice.

26:10.475 --> 26:13.511
And she did have
a very nice tushie.

26:13.578 --> 26:15.780
Apparently, the, uh,
the London School of Economics

26:15.831 --> 26:17.715
does not have
driver's ed,

26:17.783 --> 26:21.152
so driving lessons
turned into dates,

26:21.219 --> 26:23.621
and then dates turned into
a two-bedroom in Weehawken.

26:23.672 --> 26:25.523
She woke up married to a cop.

26:25.590 --> 26:27.341
That's not so bad.

26:27.426 --> 26:31.829
No. Uh, that's
what I thought, but...

26:34.383 --> 26:36.400
All right.
We're up and running here.

27:06.069 --> 27:07.237
Enjoying your tea?

27:07.238 --> 27:09.239
Yeah, I like tea.
You want... you want a cup?

27:09.307 --> 27:10.991
No. I'm good. Thanks.

27:11.076 --> 27:12.609
We got movement.

27:14.946 --> 27:16.480
All right. You want
some fresh air?

27:16.548 --> 27:17.781
Uh, yeah.

27:17.849 --> 27:19.383
Go.

27:21.052 --> 27:23.153
Okay, guys.

27:23.221 --> 27:24.755
We got the suspects--
they're heading south

27:24.823 --> 27:26.507
in a maroon SUV.

27:26.591 --> 27:28.792
Copy that. We're on it.

27:42.741 --> 27:44.241
Think they're going
on a dry run?

27:44.309 --> 27:45.476
Let's hope so.

27:45.543 --> 27:47.344
We got to find out
what they're after.

28:04.529 --> 28:06.363
All right, I'm in.

28:10.518 --> 28:12.369
What do you got?
You got anything?

28:12.437 --> 28:13.670
No, I don't have anything yet

28:13.738 --> 28:16.240
in the seven seconds
I've been here, okay?

28:16.307 --> 28:17.741
No guns, no plans
for world domination

28:17.809 --> 28:19.009
next to the cereal box.

28:19.077 --> 28:20.811
Nothing. Can I have
a couple seconds, please?

28:20.879 --> 28:22.312
So what happened
to you two anyway?

28:22.380 --> 28:23.647
Happened with you two who?

28:23.715 --> 28:25.249
What are you talking about?

28:25.316 --> 28:28.018
You and Rachel.

28:29.887 --> 28:31.655
You're breaking up.
I can't hear you.

28:34.125 --> 28:36.193
I'm going to send you something
right now.

28:37.228 --> 28:40.948
Looks like a map of downtown,

28:41.032 --> 28:42.733
highlighted.

28:43.918 --> 28:45.335
I think I just

28:45.403 --> 28:46.904
successfully sent a photograph.

28:46.971 --> 28:48.672
All right, I got, uh,

28:48.739 --> 28:50.240
registration packets,

28:50.308 --> 28:53.077
some sort of
electronic bracelet.

28:53.144 --> 28:54.912
You know,
long-distance races issue

28:54.979 --> 28:56.747
digital timing chips
to all participants.

28:56.815 --> 29:00.818
They keeps track of time,
they record GPS locations.

29:00.885 --> 29:02.419
Just send me the numbers.
We'll try to keep

29:02.487 --> 29:04.021
a tab on them
when they're in the race.

29:04.088 --> 29:06.256
When did exercise
get so complicated?

29:21.573 --> 29:23.507
<i>And there it is--</i>

29:23.575 --> 29:25.776
the third time we've passed
the Moana Surfrider.

29:25.844 --> 29:27.578
We're going in circles.

29:27.645 --> 29:29.546
Do you think they know
we're tailing them?

29:29.614 --> 29:31.548
No. I've kept eyes on
all their mirrors.

29:31.616 --> 29:32.916
They're not
looking at us.

29:33.979 --> 29:35.288
Then, what are they looking at?

29:35.288 --> 29:37.890
I don't know. This whole strip
is door-to-door jewelry stores.

29:37.958 --> 29:40.092
All high-value targets.

29:40.160 --> 29:41.827
We can put HPD
on alert, but...

29:41.895 --> 29:43.329
where do we tell them to start?

29:46.216 --> 29:49.134
I thought they were taking
the armored truck route.

29:49.202 --> 29:50.636
This doesn't
match up.

29:50.704 --> 29:52.972
Yeah, and that's the fourth
triathlon blockade we passed.

29:53.039 --> 29:54.723
We keep going
off the triathlon route.

29:54.808 --> 29:56.942
What if they're not
casing the target?

29:57.010 --> 29:59.478
What if they're mapping
their escape route?

30:09.729 --> 30:11.297
How's it going?

30:11.364 --> 30:14.099
Kind of slow, actually.

30:14.662 --> 30:16.129
Hey, I'm sorry again
to invade your space.

30:16.197 --> 30:17.431
It's all right.

30:17.499 --> 30:21.068
Sometimes I let my emotions
get the better of me.

30:22.504 --> 30:23.770
What's that?

30:23.838 --> 30:25.272
That's Danny.

30:27.575 --> 30:29.776
So he's in there
in the house with the killers?

30:29.844 --> 30:31.111
Yeah, he's
okay, though.

30:31.179 --> 30:32.446
He's... he's alone.

30:32.514 --> 30:34.314
No one there.

30:38.152 --> 30:41.388
You know, um, you
don't have to worry.

30:41.456 --> 30:43.056
Danny's a great cop.

30:43.124 --> 30:44.525
He... he knows
what he's doing.

30:44.592 --> 30:46.126
I know.

30:46.194 --> 30:50.330
I used to tell myself that
every day he went to work.

30:50.398 --> 30:52.466
Did it help?

30:52.534 --> 30:55.235
Not really.

31:02.544 --> 31:04.711
Danny, Danny,
you got to move, man.

31:04.779 --> 31:07.147
I got the other two suspects
coming in through the garage.

31:08.216 --> 31:09.483
Nice lead time, buddy.

31:09.550 --> 31:10.817
I'm sorry, okay?

31:10.885 --> 31:12.452
They're going to be
in there any second.

31:12.520 --> 31:14.021
Go, go!

31:14.088 --> 31:16.723
Have you got any flammables
in the garage?

31:16.774 --> 31:18.325
- Any kerosene, gasoline?
- What?

31:18.392 --> 31:19.326
Danny's in trouble, okay?

31:19.393 --> 31:20.727
I got to create a diversion.

31:20.795 --> 31:23.430
Oh. I have a thought.

31:25.900 --> 31:27.451
Did you leave that open?

31:27.535 --> 31:28.835
No.

31:28.903 --> 31:30.971
Maybe Sabrina.

31:36.711 --> 31:38.278
Can you grab some
more protein bars?

31:49.774 --> 31:51.325
What the hell
was that?

32:06.908 --> 32:09.159
Oh... oh, God.

32:09.243 --> 32:12.412
I'm... I'm so sorry. I...

32:12.480 --> 32:15.215
This is not my house
or my gate.

32:15.282 --> 32:17.000
I'm-I'm... I'm sorry.

32:17.085 --> 32:19.720
I... perhaps, um...

32:19.787 --> 32:22.055
Stan's going to have my head.

32:22.123 --> 32:24.725
Uh, we need to exchange the...

32:24.792 --> 32:26.960
insurance and...

32:27.028 --> 32:29.730
get your name and... fix it.

32:29.797 --> 32:31.198
I'm sorry.

32:31.265 --> 32:32.599
I'm really sorry.

32:32.650 --> 32:35.469
I... had a bit of...

32:37.572 --> 32:39.773
...G and T.

32:59.326 --> 33:00.427
Names, though I'm fairly certain

33:00.495 --> 33:02.095
they're fake.

33:02.163 --> 33:03.397
Maybe you can get
prints off the pen.

33:06.100 --> 33:08.352
"Prints off the pen"?

33:08.436 --> 33:11.038
I was married to a cop,
remember?

33:13.474 --> 33:15.409
That was the extent
of our pillow talk.

33:15.476 --> 33:16.843
Okay, Rachel,
that's not right.

33:16.894 --> 33:18.745
That's not true.
Not always.

33:20.682 --> 33:23.483
Okay, not always,
but sometimes.

33:28.154 --> 33:29.786
What happened?

33:29.787 --> 33:32.722
It had a little chat
with the neighbor's gate.

33:32.789 --> 33:35.808
Nice work. Thank you.

33:37.327 --> 33:40.329
I feel like
I've seen this trick before.

33:40.397 --> 33:42.999
Well, worked once, right?

33:43.066 --> 33:45.701
Excuse me?

33:47.471 --> 33:51.157
I'm sorry, um...

33:51.241 --> 33:52.575
Are you implying
that when you hit me,

33:52.643 --> 33:54.977
when we met,
you did it on purpose?

33:56.713 --> 33:57.747
Danny, game time.

33:57.814 --> 33:58.781
Hold on.

33:58.832 --> 34:00.550
Suspects are leaving
for the race.

34:00.617 --> 34:01.751
I'll meet you at the car.

34:01.818 --> 34:05.087
Okay, um, I need a laptop.

34:05.155 --> 34:07.006
- You have a laptop?
- What for?

34:07.090 --> 34:08.424
I need, uh...

34:08.491 --> 34:10.626
I need to see what's on this.

34:10.694 --> 34:13.513
♪ ♪

34:36.954 --> 34:38.737
♪ ♪

35:02.873 --> 35:04.310
Our crew's still in the water.

35:04.311 --> 35:05.828
So far, nothing out
of the ordinary.

35:05.912 --> 35:08.213
Right, but we still don't know
what the target is.

35:08.281 --> 35:10.716
Kono had HPD alert all the banks
and high-end jewelry stores

35:10.784 --> 35:12.084
along the triathlon's route.

35:12.152 --> 35:13.252
Okay, how are you
going there, Kitty?

35:13.286 --> 35:14.553
Not good.

35:14.621 --> 35:15.721
Is that how they do it

35:15.788 --> 35:17.222
in Jersey?
No, it's not how

35:17.290 --> 35:18.841
they do it in Jersey.
This is Grace's computer.

35:18.925 --> 35:19.958
It's the only one
Rachel could give me.

35:20.010 --> 35:22.061
And whatever's
on this flash drive

35:22.128 --> 35:23.295
is taking forever to load.

35:23.363 --> 35:25.331
It's the biggest file
in the history of files.

35:25.398 --> 35:26.732
The names that Rachel got
from the neighbors?

35:26.799 --> 35:27.983
They didn't check out.

35:28.068 --> 35:29.435
But their prints came back:
Aaron and Kim Rockwell.

35:29.502 --> 35:32.604
And I also contacted
the triathlon. They said

35:32.672 --> 35:34.306
that all four of our suspects
finished the race last year.

35:34.374 --> 35:35.908
Average times,
but they did finish.

35:35.975 --> 35:37.943
All right, so now we wait
for them to go off course.

35:37.994 --> 35:39.328
Or we get them earlier.

35:39.412 --> 35:41.780
Aaron used to work for
Oahu Federal Bank last year

35:41.831 --> 35:43.148
at the time of the heist.

35:43.199 --> 35:44.850
It's enough to detain them
on probable cause.

35:44.918 --> 35:45.918
Hey, RFID signal

35:45.985 --> 35:47.819
shows our four perps
leaving the water,

35:47.871 --> 35:48.820
getting onto their bikes.

35:48.872 --> 35:50.255
Let's go.

36:04.170 --> 36:05.771
Chin!

36:05.839 --> 36:07.005
Coming up.
Coming up.

36:09.509 --> 36:11.810
Coming up.
Coming up.

36:14.280 --> 36:16.048
One, two, three
and four.

36:16.116 --> 36:17.783
Right here. One, two,
three, and four.

36:17.850 --> 36:19.518
Stop! Stop!
Take your helmet off.

36:19.569 --> 36:21.186
Helmets off.

36:22.372 --> 36:25.157
It's not them.

36:25.716 --> 36:27.533
They tagged these riders
with their tracking chips.

36:27.618 --> 36:30.319
Which means they're pulling
the heist right now.

36:44.823 --> 36:46.624
Hey.

36:46.692 --> 36:48.626
All right, so,
uh, looks like

36:48.694 --> 36:50.261
they dumped video
from the truck's SD card

36:50.329 --> 36:51.595
onto this flash drive.

36:51.647 --> 36:53.431
All the footage is of a place
called Bobrow Imports,

36:53.499 --> 36:55.400
a South African
diamond-trading conglomerate.

36:55.467 --> 36:56.534
That's our target for sure.

36:56.601 --> 36:58.303
Millions in diamonds are easier
to transport

36:58.370 --> 36:59.370
than millions in cash.

36:59.438 --> 37:00.438
Hey, I know
that building.

37:00.489 --> 37:01.823
It's, like,
three blocks from here.

37:01.907 --> 37:03.291
Okay, well, cars are never going
to be able to cut through this.

37:03.375 --> 37:05.159
So let's go.

37:31.528 --> 37:32.662
45 seconds

37:32.713 --> 37:34.514
before motion sensors
reacclimate.

37:45.175 --> 37:48.043
Ready, three, two, one!

37:55.319 --> 37:56.886
Kono, I need you
on that roof.

37:56.937 --> 37:58.588
Copy that.

38:10.451 --> 38:11.968
Okay, I'm in position.

38:15.038 --> 38:16.506
I don't see...

38:16.573 --> 38:17.774
Wait, hang on.

38:19.209 --> 38:20.243
They're exiting the building

38:20.310 --> 38:21.944
from the Mauka side.
All four them.

38:22.012 --> 38:23.930
They're dressed as racers

38:24.014 --> 38:25.765
with black lumbar packs.

38:25.849 --> 38:27.450
Kono, talk to me.

38:27.518 --> 38:28.634
Tell me what's happening.

38:28.719 --> 38:30.620
They're splitting up!

38:30.687 --> 38:31.888
They're taking the four routes

38:31.939 --> 38:33.773
from the map.
I'm coming down,

38:33.857 --> 38:35.057
I'm going to take Mission.

38:35.109 --> 38:36.058
All right, this way.

38:36.126 --> 38:37.443
I'm on four.

38:50.657 --> 38:52.508
Hands behind your back.
Hands behind your back.

38:52.576 --> 38:54.277
Hands behind your back!

39:09.593 --> 39:11.627
Ride's over.

39:23.707 --> 39:25.191
Whoa, brah,
your arm's all bust up?

39:25.275 --> 39:26.659
I think it's broke, man.

39:26.743 --> 39:28.861
Let me help you with that.

39:57.941 --> 39:59.859
How's that sand taste?

40:21.198 --> 40:24.734
I can't thank you guys enough.

40:24.801 --> 40:26.068
Well, you don't
have to thank us.

40:26.136 --> 40:27.637
Save your energy. You got
to take care of that kid.

feeling up to it,

show you some photos, okay?

D.A.'s gonna ask you
to point out the shooter

40:35.279 --> 40:36.879
if you can.
Of course.

40:36.947 --> 40:38.381
Any time.

40:38.448 --> 40:41.484
I feel okay, actually.
I just...

40:43.954 --> 40:45.688
I'm so sorry to put Cami
through all this.

40:45.756 --> 40:47.523
Oh, no. I'm fine, babe.

40:47.591 --> 40:49.525
We're fine.
