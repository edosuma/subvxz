<i>In New York City's
war on crime,</i>

00:09.389 --> 00:11.414
<i>the worst criminal offenders
are pursued</i>

00:11.491 --> 00:14.324
<i>by the detectives
of the Major Case Squad.</i>

00:14.394 --> 00:16.361
<i>These are their stories.</i>

00:19.466 --> 00:21.593
Beeatch!
What's your problem?

00:21.668 --> 00:23.135
Mom, Gloria polished off all the milk.

00:23.203 --> 00:24.864
Did you take my soccer
uniform out of the dryer yet?

00:24.938 --> 00:27.133
Yes, I agree.
It's intolerable.

00:27.207 --> 00:28.572
Do we have any more milk? Yeah, hold on.

00:28.642 --> 00:31.475
Check the downstairs fridge.
Honey, it's in your closet.

00:31.545 --> 00:33.206
Has Sean come out
of his room yet?

00:33.280 --> 00:34.508
Uh-uh.
What's the drama?

00:34.581 --> 00:37.778
Oh! He wants to go to a party,
and the parents won't be home.

00:37.851 --> 00:38.840
Sorry, go on.

00:38.919 --> 00:40.477
Anyone see my belt?

00:40.554 --> 00:44.684
Yes, I will put it on my calendar
for this afternoon. Great, okay.

00:45.425 --> 00:47.416
Sean, sweetie,
come on, we gotta go!

00:47.494 --> 00:49.359
Don't call me sweetie.

00:55.369 --> 00:56.734
Let's go.

01:19.826 --> 01:24.229
Hey, what do you say to a Knicks game
next week? I can get seats on the floor.

01:24.297 --> 01:26.356
Thomas, can you stop here?
I want to get out.

01:26.433 --> 01:29.061
But we're
two blocks from your school.

01:46.586 --> 01:49.054
In view of these credible
threats to witnesses,

01:49.122 --> 01:51.113
I'm issuing an order
suspending the defendants'

01:51.191 --> 01:53.216
family visits and telephone
privileges effective immediately.

01:53.293 --> 01:54.351
You bitch!

01:55.495 --> 01:58.123
Order! Order!
You will remain seated!

01:58.298 --> 01:59.287
Bitch!

02:02.335 --> 02:04.428
You will
remain seated!

02:05.405 --> 02:07.635
You will clear
the gallery!

02:09.476 --> 02:11.239
Race traitor!

02:27.994 --> 02:30.121
A big road
ahead of us.

02:41.141 --> 02:42.199
Mom!

02:45.712 --> 02:48.408
My kids... My kids...

03:46.840 --> 03:49.104
Neighbor heard
shots, called 911.

03:49.175 --> 03:52.372
The kids were found
hiding in the master bath.

03:52.445 --> 03:54.345
How'd the perps
get in?

03:54.414 --> 03:56.041
Basement window.

03:56.116 --> 03:57.515
We got casings
from two weapons,

03:57.584 --> 04:00.610
a nine mil
and a 5.56 mil.

04:00.954 --> 04:02.581
Any lights on?

04:02.656 --> 04:04.886
Not when the units responded.

04:07.594 --> 04:10.028
One shot.
In the dark.

04:12.832 --> 04:16.130
The judge and her family
moved in two months ago.

04:16.202 --> 04:18.101
The alarm system hadn't
been tuned up yet.

04:18.171 --> 04:20.503
Why wasn't a security
detail outside the house?

04:20.574 --> 04:23.236
Judge Barton was threatened
by a pack of thugs.

04:23.310 --> 04:25.972
The detail was pulled
three days ago.

04:26.046 --> 04:29.311
Husband was found here. He's at
Mount Sinai, still in surgery.

04:29.382 --> 04:31.976
Attorney General's
Office. Excuse me.

04:32.919 --> 04:34.216
Basement?

04:38.792 --> 04:42.319
The Judge's
17-year-old, Oliver.

04:42.395 --> 04:44.886
Looks like he walked
in on the intruders.

04:45.398 --> 04:48.390
The shot came from in there,
where we found the nine mil casing.

04:48.468 --> 04:50.629
That's probably what
woke everyone up.

04:50.704 --> 04:53.002
That's the window
they came in?

04:53.173 --> 04:54.970
Yeah, they cut out
the caulking,

04:55.041 --> 04:57.305
popped the glass, and
replaced it after they came in.

04:57.377 --> 04:58.810
The house
empty all day?

04:58.878 --> 05:01.506
Mmm-hmm.
Kids came home around 4:00.

05:05.785 --> 05:08.117
Looks like they were
hiding back here.

05:08.188 --> 05:09.815
They have...

05:12.826 --> 05:16.318
Sunflower seeds, shredded
coconut, that's...

05:16.396 --> 05:17.863
That's high-energy food.

05:17.931 --> 05:19.330
They were keeping
themselves pumped up,

05:19.399 --> 05:20.764
waiting for everybody
to fall asleep.

05:20.834 --> 05:23.166
Squeezed in there,
munching nuts,

05:23.236 --> 05:27.195
not making a sound for eight
hours... I'd last one on a good day.

05:28.575 --> 05:31.567
Mom woke me up and
dragged me to the bathroom.

05:32.679 --> 05:35.341
What about you, Sean?
You see anything?

05:36.383 --> 05:38.351
She told us
to lock the door.

05:38.418 --> 05:41.353
Well, that was
a smart thing for her to do.

05:42.055 --> 05:45.252
Now, when you were inside
there, did you hear anything?

05:45.325 --> 05:47.725
Did you hear people
talking, or...

05:47.794 --> 05:52.356
Yeah, there was this
one guy, he talked weird.

05:52.432 --> 05:57.426
He said something like,
"Red master bring today. "

05:57.937 --> 06:00.963
"Bring today. "

06:07.847 --> 06:10.042
Could he have
said, "To bay"?

06:10.617 --> 06:11.743
Yeah.

06:14.354 --> 06:16.049
Then we heard Mom.

06:18.358 --> 06:20.223
Thank you for your help.

06:20.293 --> 06:23.490
We're very sorry about
your mom and your brother.

06:26.766 --> 06:29.894
Sean, you did what your
mother wanted you to.

06:30.904 --> 06:32.872
She wanted you to live.

06:40.246 --> 06:43.477
Red master. Red, for the prime target,

06:43.550 --> 06:46.178
master, for the
master bedroom?

06:47.454 --> 06:51.220
"Bring to bay," that's when
you run a deer to exhaustion.

06:51.291 --> 06:55.785
It turns to face you.
It's hunters. Good ones.

06:57.864 --> 07:00.628
Judge Barton asked us to
re-evaluate her surveillance.

07:00.700 --> 07:02.531
We'd been monitoring
Brownfeld's group.

07:02.602 --> 07:04.399
There were no further
threats, no chatter.

07:04.471 --> 07:07.838
We... We took
a calculated risk.

07:07.907 --> 07:10.239
You need
a new calculator.

07:10.310 --> 07:12.710
Mr. Brownfeld espouses
violent race hatred.

07:12.779 --> 07:14.337
He and his co-defendants are on trial

07:14.414 --> 07:17.815
for stockpiling over 50
military-grade weapons.

07:18.718 --> 07:20.515
Thank you,
Detective.

07:23.857 --> 07:26.451
The people who did this
showed some impressive moves.

07:26.526 --> 07:31.190
They're trained, disciplined,
no wasted shots, no panic.

07:32.699 --> 07:34.667
Mr. Brownfeld
wants to meet.

07:34.734 --> 07:37.396
Too bad my dashiki's
at the cleaners.

07:40.607 --> 07:42.438
I was not party
to this thing.

07:42.509 --> 07:44.909
My people were
not party to it.

07:44.978 --> 07:47.845
Anybody says
we were, is a liar.

07:47.914 --> 07:50.849
"I don't expect justice
from a race traitor

07:50.917 --> 07:55.081
"who raises her children in a
Zionist enclave like Riverdale. "

07:55.155 --> 07:57.123
We're family men.

07:57.190 --> 08:00.990
It's bad enough they violated
our right to bear arms.

08:01.060 --> 08:03.893
Now they want to cut us
off from our families.

08:03.963 --> 08:08.832
You had a baby boy a
month ago, didn't you?

08:09.536 --> 08:13.097
Did you get to hold him before
Judge Barton stopped your visits?

08:13.173 --> 08:15.505
No, my girlfriend had to
stay with him in the hospital

08:15.575 --> 08:19.238
because some bush doctor
forced her to have a C-section.

08:23.516 --> 08:26.417
You didn't get to hold
your son in your arms.

08:27.120 --> 08:28.917
What's that
worth to you?

08:28.988 --> 08:30.888
You're offering him a contact visit?

08:30.957 --> 08:34.893
If he can help us find
Judge Barton's real killers.

08:35.962 --> 08:39.557
You know, I have
lots of fans out there.

08:40.500 --> 08:43.765
Real loose cannons, they
send me all kinds of letters.

08:43.903 --> 08:44.995
You're welcome to it all.

08:45.071 --> 08:47.835
That might be worth one
phone call to his girlfriend.

08:47.907 --> 08:50.535
If he wants more,
he needs to do more.

08:50.610 --> 08:56.378
We want him to wear a wire when
he's speaking to his co-defendants.

09:00.954 --> 09:03.684
Can't do it. These people look up to me.

09:07.961 --> 09:09.758
I'm no race traitor.

09:14.434 --> 09:16.766
We accept your offer
on the phone call.

09:16.836 --> 09:19.031
I'll send you
the letters tomorrow.

09:21.274 --> 09:24.505
If someone in his group
did it, he didn't order it.

09:24.577 --> 09:26.340
That's why he hesitated
before he said no.

09:27.947 --> 09:31.713
He's not sure if one of his
followers didn't kill Judge Barton.

09:31.784 --> 09:33.183
If Mr. Brownfeld
won't cooperate,

09:33.253 --> 09:36.916
I'll stretch a conspiracy charge
all the way around his neck.

09:36.990 --> 09:41.359
Judge Barton's husband's out of his
second surgery. He's able to talk.

09:46.666 --> 09:48.258
What are you,
bloodthirsty today?

09:48.334 --> 09:50.427
I play to win, man,
it's the Brooklyn in me.

09:50.503 --> 09:52.266
Back to the factory.

09:54.140 --> 09:55.539
You know
I was up by one.

09:55.608 --> 09:57.098
Whatever you say,
Your Honor.

09:57.176 --> 09:59.007
Only a fool argues
with a judge.

10:13.960 --> 10:16.292
It woke us up.
I went downstairs.

10:16.362 --> 10:17.852
It was dark.
I could feel movement.

10:20.967 --> 10:25.461
I realized then I didn't have
anything to protect my family with.

10:26.572 --> 10:29.006
Did you see
the intruders?

10:29.075 --> 10:30.133
No.

10:31.945 --> 10:34.004
One of them
stood over me.

10:35.949 --> 10:38.543
The gun barrel
was right in my face.

10:40.620 --> 10:42.451
Then he moved
it away, and...

10:43.122 --> 10:45.647
Why? Did you say
something to him?

10:45.725 --> 10:49.855
I tried to tell him not to kill
me. My kids still needed me.

10:53.266 --> 10:57.100
All I managed to get out
was, "My kids, my kids. "

11:06.179 --> 11:11.048
It's crazy, just last week
I told Ellen we were lucky.

11:11.918 --> 11:13.078
Why is that?

11:13.152 --> 11:17.020
I was at our old house in Queens,
picking up a package that got sent there.

11:17.090 --> 11:19.820
And they told me
they'd been burglarized.

11:20.393 --> 11:24.693
Burglarized. This happened after
the incident in the courtroom?

11:24.764 --> 11:25.856
Yeah.

11:26.866 --> 11:29.357
They have your
forwarding address?

11:31.904 --> 11:33.064
Yeah.

11:35.141 --> 11:37.575
Burglary report says they came
in through the basement window,

11:37.643 --> 11:41.477
same MO, caulking,
glass put back in place.

11:41.547 --> 11:44.311
But the killers had
the Bartons' old address.

11:44.384 --> 11:48.013
Maybe it's only after they broke in
they realized the Bartons had moved.

11:48.087 --> 11:51.523
They must have found the
forwarding address in Riverdale.

11:51.991 --> 11:56.257
Brownfeld's little speech
about the Zionist enclave,

11:56.329 --> 11:58.923
see, he knew that the
Bartons lived in Riverdale.

11:58.998 --> 12:00.260
The killers are not
part of his group.

12:00.333 --> 12:02.062
Somehow, I don't find
that comforting.

12:02.135 --> 12:03.568
They shot another one!

12:03.636 --> 12:07.367
On a handball court in Chinatown,
Judge Roland Thibodeaux.

12:08.775 --> 12:10.436
It's open season.

12:15.548 --> 12:17.072
Every day,
weather permitting,

12:17.150 --> 12:19.846
Judge Thibodeaux comes out
here to snap the pavement.

12:19.919 --> 12:23.377
The ball rolled to the
sidewall. The Judge went for it.

12:23.456 --> 12:25.014
I was getting a water.

12:25.091 --> 12:28.026
I heard a crack. I
looked over, there he was.

12:29.395 --> 12:31.420
Twelve years,
I've been his driver.

12:31.497 --> 12:32.896
Thank you,
Mr. Stevens.

12:32.965 --> 12:34.227
Mmm-hmm.

12:34.767 --> 12:36.359
The entrance
wound is at his heart.

12:36.436 --> 12:39.132
The exit is coming out
his left shoulder blade.

12:39.205 --> 12:42.538
So the shot, it would've
come in at an angle.

12:43.509 --> 12:45.773
Got a watch on his right arm,
he's probably left-handed.

12:45.845 --> 12:49.906
Now, he's got a brace on his right
knee. His leg is probably stiff,

12:49.982 --> 12:53.816
so he would've bent down and
grabbed the ball like this,

12:53.886 --> 12:56.320
that lines up his heart
and his shoulder blade,

12:56.389 --> 12:59.449
so the shot would've
come right through there.

13:02.662 --> 13:05.756
By the smell, I'm guessing
that spells seafood.

13:05.832 --> 13:10.667
Place probably caters to local
restaurants, shuts down by noon.

13:13.439 --> 13:15.634
Well, this looks
about right.

13:16.542 --> 13:19.409
It's quite a feat to thread
the needle from this distance,

13:19.479 --> 13:22.448
especially with this
cross-breeze from the east.

13:23.983 --> 13:30.547
That looks new. Shooters
like code. "W2CXRQ."

13:30.623 --> 13:32.420
Wind from the east.

13:34.660 --> 13:36.821
He'd have to adjust to his left.

13:36.896 --> 13:39.364
So, "W" could be windage.

13:39.432 --> 13:41.059
Trembling aspens.

13:41.134 --> 13:45.298
Could be two clicks to the right
of the tree, closest to the wall.

13:48.608 --> 13:51.907
That would give
him his target.

13:51.978 --> 13:54.742
The Judge walked
into the crosshairs.

13:54.814 --> 13:59.114
But why write it down?
Why write down the windage?

14:02.321 --> 14:05.017
Well, one must've set up the
shot for the other one to take.

14:05.091 --> 14:07.321
One has more experience
than the other.

14:07.393 --> 14:11.523
Training exercise. I hate to see
what the final exam looks like.

14:12.498 --> 14:17.026
An African-American judge, an
appellate court judge, no less.

14:17.103 --> 14:19.333
Chief of D is setting up a task force.

14:19.405 --> 14:21.430
People are talking about
multiple assassination teams.

14:21.507 --> 14:22.906
Looks like
the same shooters.

14:22.975 --> 14:24.772
CSU found the slug
in a post,

14:24.844 --> 14:27.404
matched it to the one
that killed Judge Barton.

14:27.480 --> 14:31.109
Maybe we should put out an APB for
somebody in a Tom DeLay T-shirt.

14:31.184 --> 14:33.118
Quaking aspens.

14:33.186 --> 14:36.212
That's what they call trembling
aspens in the Rocky Mountain states.

14:36.289 --> 14:38.154
Quakie for short.

14:38.224 --> 14:40.249
"Q" in the windage
instructions.

14:40.326 --> 14:42.692
Two clicks right of the quake.

14:44.964 --> 14:46.363
Our shooters
are from out west.

14:46.432 --> 14:48.457
Home of a lot of white
supremacist groups.

14:48.534 --> 14:49.762
They chose
the wrong target.

14:49.835 --> 14:53.134
Judge Thibodeaux was one of the most
conservative jurists in the state,

14:53.206 --> 14:55.265
pro-life,
pro-school prayer.

14:55.341 --> 14:57.206
Anti-busing,
back in the day.

14:57.276 --> 14:59.972
See what cases he was handling lately.

15:00.813 --> 15:04.749
Here's a press case. Week
before last, assisted suicide.

15:04.817 --> 15:06.876
Trial judge dismissed
the manslaughter charge.

15:06.953 --> 15:08.750
The appellate court
reinstated it.

15:08.821 --> 15:11.790
Judge Thibodeaux wrote
the majority opinion.

15:11.857 --> 15:14.417
That would've gotten
his name in the papers.

15:17.930 --> 15:19.921
This was between
me and Roger.

15:19.999 --> 15:21.990
It never should have been
anybody else's business.

15:22.068 --> 15:24.468
Mr. Traynor, we're here because
the judge who brought back

15:24.537 --> 15:27.529
the charge against you
was murdered yesterday.

15:30.243 --> 15:34.873
Now, Roger had a terminal
disease of the brain.

15:34.947 --> 15:38.144
He was losing his faculties.
He asked for my help.

15:38.217 --> 15:40.344
Just something between
two old Army buddies, huh?

15:40.419 --> 15:42.410
You guys were in the
Korean War together, right?

15:42.488 --> 15:44.615
Kept each
other alive.

15:44.690 --> 15:48.922
Now we're old men, they tell us it's
not for us to decide when to die.

15:49.795 --> 15:51.922
It's all laws
and lawyers now.

15:51.998 --> 15:54.865
Have you gotten a lot of mail
about this from supporters?

15:54.934 --> 15:56.367
We'd like to read it.

15:56.435 --> 15:59.427
I hope you got a lot
of room in your truck.

16:02.942 --> 16:06.241
Attacks on personal liberty.
Maybe that's their beef?

16:07.446 --> 16:10.779
"Who are these judges who intrude
into our most personal matters?

16:11.550 --> 16:16.249
"We allow them to wield power
over us like petty gods.

16:16.856 --> 16:19.381
"We've become a nation
of laws, not people. "

16:20.459 --> 16:23.553
It's postmarked
Manhattan, week ago.

16:23.629 --> 16:25.824
There's no signature.
It sounds familiar.

16:25.898 --> 16:30.460
It looks familiar, too. I noticed one
just like it in the mail to Brownfeld.

16:33.406 --> 16:36.807
"Mr. Brownfeld, I don't
subscribe to your racial politics.

16:36.876 --> 16:39.674
"But not only has your right to
bear arms been infringed upon,

16:39.745 --> 16:42.714
"now an arrogant judge has
cut you off from your family.

16:42.782 --> 16:46.479
"This is inevitable in a nation
that values laws over people. "

16:46.552 --> 16:50.249
Unsigned, postmarked
two weeks ago in Missouri.

16:50.323 --> 16:52.985
Same rhetoric,
same block lettering.

16:56.929 --> 16:59.227
"It is time to act overtly
against this tyranny.

16:59.298 --> 17:02.233
"Our purpose can
no longer be obscured. "

17:04.569 --> 17:08.131
"Obscured. "
They might have...

17:08.941 --> 17:11.068
They might have
killed before.

17:11.143 --> 17:14.078
Maybe disguised it as
something else, an accident.

17:14.146 --> 17:17.012
We cast a net
for dead judges...

17:18.117 --> 17:21.086
Yeah, we cast it towards
the Rocky Mountains.

17:21.252 --> 17:22.845
Five weeks
ago in Tulsa,

17:22.922 --> 17:27.051
Judge Eduardo Mestres shot dead
during an attempted carjacking.

17:27.126 --> 17:30.357
No wits, no suspects,
weapon used was a nine mil.

17:30.429 --> 17:32.556
Nine weeks ago, outside
Billings, Montana,

17:32.631 --> 17:35.498
Judge Irwin Reisman was killed
in a suspected hunting accident.

17:35.568 --> 17:38.799
Again, no witnesses. The
slug was a 5.56 millimeter,

17:38.871 --> 17:43.103
same caliber used on
Barton and Thibodeaux.

17:43.175 --> 17:44.972
So these nuts got their start out west.

17:45.044 --> 17:50.038
Except that Judge Reisman was a
retired New York Family Court judge.

17:50.116 --> 17:52.949
These nuts might be
homegrown after all.

17:55.821 --> 17:59.188
The line was forever.
Didn't mean to make you wait.

18:00.393 --> 18:03.419
You didn't make me wait.
They made us wait.

18:03.796 --> 18:05.058
Yes, sir.

18:07.900 --> 18:10.994
I'll live to see this
place burn to the ground.

18:20.079 --> 18:23.845
The FBI will take over the Montana
and Oklahoma investigations.

18:24.517 --> 18:28.214
They want us to sign off on a press
bulletin linking all four killings.

18:28.287 --> 18:30.312
That's too much
information.

18:30.856 --> 18:35.293
The murders out west, they
were disguised as an accident,

18:35.361 --> 18:36.828
a robbery, for a reason.

18:38.097 --> 18:39.860
Maybe so that the killers
could hide the fact

18:39.932 --> 18:42.423
that they had a personal
motive, to kill those judges.

18:42.501 --> 18:45.231
The motive's no mystery
to me. It's racial terror.

18:45.304 --> 18:47.169
Their first victim,
Judge Reisman,

18:47.239 --> 18:50.697
was a Family Court judge in
Brooklyn, handling custody cases.

18:50.776 --> 18:53.438
Wade Brownfeld was
denied visits to his son.

18:53.512 --> 18:56.709
And Barton's life was spared
when he mentioned his kids.

18:56.782 --> 18:59.444
Maybe one of the shooters feels
he got shafted in a custody case.

18:59.518 --> 19:01.816
Maybe one of Reisman's old cases.

19:01.887 --> 19:05.152
Thirty years on the bench.
Tens of thousands of cases.

19:05.224 --> 19:08.284
It's not as if we have
all the time in the world.

19:08.627 --> 19:12.290
Counting only fathers between
the ages of 25 and 60

19:12.364 --> 19:15.162
who lost custody cases and
whose whereabouts are unknown,

19:15.234 --> 19:18.294
it leaves just over
1,200 individuals.

19:20.606 --> 19:24.633
Well, you can add health-food
fanatic to their criteria.

19:25.711 --> 19:26.939
Is that a hunting blind?

19:27.012 --> 19:29.913
That's where the shot came
from that killed Judge Reisman.

19:29.982 --> 19:31.506
Look at these berries.

19:31.584 --> 19:32.983
Dried cranberries?

19:33.052 --> 19:34.679
Wolfberries. They...

19:35.688 --> 19:38.156
They're used
in Chinese medicine.

19:39.959 --> 19:43.861
They support the immune system,
improve eyesight, you know...

19:46.765 --> 19:50.223
A month later, this was found in
the corner of a parking garage.

19:50.302 --> 19:54.261
That's where the killers lay in
wait for Judge Mestres in Tulsa.

19:58.711 --> 20:00.770
They're harvested
wild in Tibet.

20:00.846 --> 20:03.872
The killers' discipline
was extended to their diet.

20:03.949 --> 20:07.248
Well, then they're not
shopping at my corner bodega.

20:10.289 --> 20:11.415
Gojis are hard to get.

20:11.490 --> 20:13.822
We're only one of six stores
in the city that carry them.

20:13.893 --> 20:15.588
Seven stores,
we checked.

20:15.661 --> 20:18.061
We're looking for two
men who might've come in

20:18.130 --> 20:20.860
in the last couple
of weeks to buy some.

20:21.100 --> 20:22.727
They'd be
from out west.

20:22.801 --> 20:24.826
I don't know.
They wear cowboy hats?

20:24.904 --> 20:26.701
Well, I'm sure they'd have
something to say about this.

20:26.772 --> 20:28.501
"Due to recent
court decisions

20:28.574 --> 20:30.303
"the following products will
no longer be available. "

20:30.376 --> 20:33.311
Mmm-hmm. A lot of people have
something to say about that.

20:33.379 --> 20:38.817
This would be along the lines
of a nation of laws, not people.

20:38.884 --> 20:40.181
Oh, sure.

20:40.252 --> 20:42.652
Couple of days ago, two
guys, one with a beard,

20:42.721 --> 20:44.484
they came in two,
three times.

20:44.557 --> 20:45.581
How'd they pay?

20:45.658 --> 20:49.116
Cash. They spent over 200 bucks
on gojis and sprouted nuts,

20:49.194 --> 20:51.754
and then the guy
who asked about the sign

20:51.830 --> 20:56.290
handed me a bunch of greasy
5s and 10s. It's so toxic.

20:56.468 --> 20:57.662
This is the one
with the beard?

20:57.736 --> 20:58.725
No, the other guy.

20:58.804 --> 21:01.398
The beard stayed over by the
door with his head down, waiting.

21:01.473 --> 21:03.737
He was like the
other guy's dog.

21:03.809 --> 21:07.575
Well, when the other guy took out his
wallet to pay, you notice any ID, a license?

21:07.646 --> 21:10.171
No, he had the bills
loose in his pocket.

21:10.249 --> 21:13.810
All he pulled out were car
keys and a parking lot ticket.

21:13.886 --> 21:17.447
They had a beater car,
a 1980 POS, piece of...

21:17.523 --> 21:20.219
Got it. You catch
anything off the plates?

21:20.726 --> 21:23.559
It was out-of-state like you said,
but I didn't catch any digits.

21:23.629 --> 21:28.931
All the work you guys do in a day,
how come you noticed these guys?

21:29.001 --> 21:31.970
Well, the older dude, he came
with the groceries and drove off.

21:32.037 --> 21:35.131
But then, 10 minutes later, the guy with
the beard came looking for his buddy,

21:35.207 --> 21:37.835
and I told him he was gone,
the dude freaked out.

21:37.910 --> 21:39.138
Angry?

21:39.211 --> 21:40.303
No, scared.

21:41.180 --> 21:42.613
And under that beard,
he's young.

21:42.681 --> 21:44.308
He was running around,
all upset,

21:44.383 --> 21:47.580
and then he dropped his bag
full of these sparkplugs.

21:48.020 --> 21:49.282
Was he saying anything?

21:49.355 --> 21:52.188
He kept asking if that other
dude left instructions for him.

21:52.257 --> 21:54.691
And then he asked what
bus goes to Howard Beach,

21:54.760 --> 21:57.160
but do I look like
I go to Howard Beach?

21:57.229 --> 21:59.197
He came back for him? Oh, yeah.

21:59.264 --> 22:00.925
And then the kid with
the beard went all quiet,

22:01.000 --> 22:02.024
picked up his sparkplugs

22:02.101 --> 22:03.432
and got in the car.

22:03.502 --> 22:05.527
Did you notice any
tools, engine parts?

22:05.604 --> 22:07.401
Yeah, the backseat was
filled with that stuff.

22:07.473 --> 22:08.770
Hey, buddy!

22:11.076 --> 22:15.172
Fixing engines on the cheap. Must
be how they pay for their gojis.

22:16.849 --> 22:19.044
Howard Beach, it's
probably outboard motors.

22:19.118 --> 22:21.746
Great, I can wear
my clam diggers.

22:22.955 --> 22:26.618
Talk about beater cars. And
they all have New York plates.

22:30.429 --> 22:31.691
Blue Pontiac.

22:31.764 --> 22:35.165
I can't see the plates.
And he's alone.

22:35.234 --> 22:37.361
There's seating for two.

22:38.771 --> 22:40.238
Hey, excuse me!

22:40.305 --> 22:43.172
You got some time to
take a look at this thing?

22:43.242 --> 22:45.676
I think the shifter's jammed up.

22:46.311 --> 22:50.407
Think you could do it now? I
promised her a cruise around the bay.

22:50.883 --> 22:52.748
It's my kid's wagon.
I'll give you a hand.

22:52.818 --> 22:54.342
No, better
I do it myself.

22:54.420 --> 22:55.444
All right.

22:55.521 --> 22:58.820
I just moved in from the
city. It wasn't my choice.

22:58.891 --> 23:04.227
Ex got the condo in Chelsea and I
ended up with a shack in Howard Beach.

23:05.431 --> 23:08.832
Yeah, I thought my boy'd
like it out here, you know?

23:10.469 --> 23:14.462
That's why I got the boat and
all, to take him fishing and stuff.

23:14.973 --> 23:17.100
Right age,
kids love fishing.

23:17.176 --> 23:18.734
You got kids?

23:21.113 --> 23:23.809
Anyway, that was
the plan, you know.

23:25.551 --> 23:27.951
Then the judge decided that
my boy would be better off

23:28.020 --> 23:30.454
spending summers
away with his mom.

23:30.522 --> 23:34.481
I tell you, this shared custody
thing, man. Boy, it is a joke.

23:35.761 --> 23:38.958
You know, I got to beg a
judge to see my own son.

23:40.699 --> 23:43.725
Did you say you were
divorced? You had kids?

23:43.802 --> 23:45.963
Did the judge put you
through the wringer?

23:46.038 --> 23:49.599
You know what? I don't have
the right tools for this.

23:50.209 --> 23:52.143
Try the guy over there,
yellow shirt.

23:52.211 --> 23:53.678
Goji berries!

23:53.746 --> 23:56.112
You aren't planning on eating
these all by yourself, are you?

23:56.181 --> 23:57.273
That's private property.

23:57.349 --> 23:59.783
I got a job in the Rockaways.
Just leave the stand,

23:59.852 --> 24:00.910
I'll pick it up later.

24:00.986 --> 24:03.216
Oh, look!
Utah plates.

24:03.288 --> 24:05.279
So what? So for sure
you don't have a permit

24:05.357 --> 24:07.791
to fix engines
on a public street.

24:10.062 --> 24:12.963
Yeah, you know, all this oil and junk
that you dropped on the ground here,

24:13.031 --> 24:16.000
that's going to cost you
another half-a-dozen violations.

24:16.068 --> 24:17.501
You're under arrest.

24:19.271 --> 24:22.365
We take littering pretty
seriously around here.

24:23.342 --> 24:25.071
Get him out of here.

24:28.147 --> 24:31.583
Lloyd Anson Wilkes.
Arizona driver's license.

24:32.084 --> 24:34.416
You sure you don't
want us to call anyone?

24:34.486 --> 24:37.114
Just tell me the fine, I'll pay it.

24:37.189 --> 24:38.884
Well, the fine'll
be up to the judge.

24:38.957 --> 24:40.720
Lloyd has
a record in New York.

24:40.793 --> 24:46.026
Custodial interference, victim
was an Eric Wilkes, five years old.

24:48.934 --> 24:52.893
I knew it. Your wife had
custody, you snatched the kid.

24:52.971 --> 24:54.097
You returned
him a week later.

24:54.173 --> 24:56.073
Judge gave Lloyd probation.

24:56.141 --> 24:58.769
But he terminated your visitations,
and he probably gave you

24:58.877 --> 25:00.811
not much to begin with.

25:01.880 --> 25:04.610
That's what drove you
to snatch the kid.

25:05.317 --> 25:07.683
You know, these judges...

25:08.921 --> 25:11.856
These judges, they have all this
power in their hands, you know?

25:11.924 --> 25:14.893
Keep families apart, dictate
our personal behavior,

25:14.960 --> 25:17.485
they treat us like children,
don't you think?

25:17.563 --> 25:20.088
There's all these laws, Lloyd,

25:20.165 --> 25:23.225
and the people buried under
the weight of so many laws.

25:27.272 --> 25:30.207
Who's on top, pressing
down? It's the judges.

25:30.275 --> 25:32.038
Like your judge,
what was his name?

25:32.110 --> 25:34.442
Reisman.
Irwin Reisman.

25:35.614 --> 25:38.742
I bet you'd like to have
a few words with him.

25:40.185 --> 25:42.380
Make yourself comfortable.

25:42.454 --> 25:45.321
With any luck, you'll have company soon.

25:53.298 --> 25:55.596
His car was clean.

25:55.667 --> 25:58.500
No weapons, nothing to
connect him to the shootings.

25:59.104 --> 26:02.267
Except for Judge Reisman
presiding over his divorce.

26:02.808 --> 26:04.742
After he was denied
visitation, what happened?

26:04.810 --> 26:07.608
His ex-wife moved
to Ohio with the boy.

26:08.113 --> 26:11.241
Now, he tried to get a
court order, stopping them.

26:11.617 --> 26:13.608
But Reisman denied it.

26:13.685 --> 26:14.845
That'd be hard to take.

26:14.920 --> 26:17.855
In '93, Wilkes moved to
Ohio and filed for custody.

26:17.923 --> 26:19.481
He was denied.

26:19.558 --> 26:22.550
In '96, the wife
moved again to Iowa,

26:22.628 --> 26:25.461
he moved and filed
again, denied again.

26:25.898 --> 26:28.093
She kept moving,
he kept filing.

26:28.333 --> 26:32.827
Last time was in 2001
in Arizona. Nothing since.

26:33.171 --> 26:37.608
Just court petitions asking for
his wife and son's whereabouts.

26:37.676 --> 26:38.973
He lost track of them.

26:39.044 --> 26:40.875
"New York City Office
of Vital Records,"

26:40.946 --> 26:43.210
it's a receipt
for a birth certificate.

26:43.282 --> 26:44.442
From four days ago.

26:45.550 --> 26:48.678
Lloyd Wilkes was born in Plattsburgh.

26:48.754 --> 26:51.245
This must be for the
other guy, the beard.

26:51.323 --> 26:53.314
He was born
in the city.

26:53.392 --> 26:56.725
Looks like he was interested
in joining the service.

26:57.062 --> 27:00.088
"Junior ROTC, West Provo
High School, Utah. "

27:04.736 --> 27:09.469
He walks behind Lloyd,
follows Lloyd's instructions.

27:11.076 --> 27:14.375
His son, Eric,
would be 17 by now.

27:18.250 --> 27:21.219
That's who this is.
He found his son.

27:23.021 --> 27:24.716
And he's training
him to be a killer.

27:24.790 --> 27:26.917
An army of two.

28:03.829 --> 28:06.662
Business license
violation, littering...

28:06.732 --> 28:09.895
Mr. Wilkes'll be out picking his
next target before we know it.

28:09.968 --> 28:12.266
I'll try to have bail
set beyond his reach.

28:12.337 --> 28:15.397
That is, if any judge
agrees to arraign him.

28:15.474 --> 28:18.068
They're all afraid of
ending up on his hit list.

28:18.143 --> 28:19.906
Besides the custodial interference,

28:19.978 --> 28:22.242
anything else I can tell
the judge about Mr. Wilkes?

28:22.314 --> 28:26.148
Before he hit the road in '93, he
had a hardware store in Flatbush.

28:26.218 --> 28:28.277
His wife claimed he had

28:28.353 --> 28:32.687
"an explosive temper and was physically
abusive to her in front of their son. "

28:32.758 --> 28:36.660
But there is no record of domestic
dispute calls to the house.

28:36.895 --> 28:41.161
Now, I saw a man who seemed to
prize discipline, self-control.

28:42.434 --> 28:45.130
Not counting an occasional
murder of a judge.

28:45.203 --> 28:47.728
Yes? Thank you.

28:50.308 --> 28:52.435
Mr. Wilkes has been
scheduled for an arraignment

28:52.511 --> 28:54.638
this afternoon
by Judge Freeman.

28:54.713 --> 28:57.307
Finally, a judge
who's unafraid.

28:57.382 --> 28:59.850
Or who doesn't
read the papers.

28:59.985 --> 29:02.419
$10,000 is excessive, Your Honor.

29:02.487 --> 29:05.081
Mr. Carver just wants to
see my client locked up.

29:05.157 --> 29:08.092
I have no confidence Mr.
Wilkes will show up for trial.

29:08.160 --> 29:10.253
He has a history of
defying judicial authority.

29:10.328 --> 29:13.422
He kidnapped his son in violation
of court-ordered visitation.

29:13.498 --> 29:15.489
I was a very
undisciplined man then.

29:15.567 --> 29:18.559
I would never allow myself to
lose control like that again.

29:18.637 --> 29:21.504
Ms. Casilio, what assets
does your client have?

29:21.573 --> 29:25.009
None, Your Honor.
No property, no savings.

29:25.077 --> 29:27.807
Then bail is set
for $20,000.

29:27.879 --> 29:29.107
Next up.
Your Honor!

29:29.181 --> 29:30.808
I said next up.

29:36.321 --> 29:38.152
A judge after
your own heart.

29:38.223 --> 29:40.316
Yeah, all we
bought is time.

29:40.392 --> 29:41.984
Find the son
and the guns.

29:42.060 --> 29:44.893
Wilkes had one character witness
during his custody hearings.

29:44.963 --> 29:45.952
We tracked him down.

29:46.031 --> 29:48.898
He might have been in touch
with Wilkes or the kid.

29:51.103 --> 29:52.934
Lloyd and I were
just neighbors.

29:53.038 --> 29:55.666
And I bought my electrical
supplies from him.

29:55.740 --> 29:57.799
And you testified
on his behalf.

29:57.876 --> 29:59.343
Yeah, I thought he
was getting a raw deal.

29:59.411 --> 30:00.969
A guy who
hit his wife?

30:01.046 --> 30:04.243
He never hit Lisa. Ask my
wife, they were friends.

30:04.649 --> 30:07.277
Lloyd's temper,
that's another thing.

30:07.352 --> 30:09.843
Me and him were alike.
Nobody could tell us anything.

30:09.921 --> 30:11.479
That's fine
when you're young,

30:11.556 --> 30:13.683
but you can't stay at war
with the world all your life,

30:13.758 --> 30:16.488
because no matter what,
the world's going to win.

30:16.561 --> 30:19.052
But still, you thought
he was a good father.

30:19.131 --> 30:20.860
I saw for myself.

30:20.932 --> 30:22.729
Eric's shoulder got
damaged during his birth.

30:22.801 --> 30:24.132
He could never
move it right.

30:24.202 --> 30:26.966
He couldn't play sports,
or throw a ball.

30:27.038 --> 30:30.007
Lloyd would be out in the yard
every day with Eric, for hours,

30:30.075 --> 30:31.736
playing catch with him.

30:31.810 --> 30:35.075
Lloyd never said a cross
word, never lost patience.

30:35.147 --> 30:36.136
That kid loved him.

30:37.482 --> 30:41.612
If you see Eric, give us a call. Thanks.

30:42.821 --> 30:46.348
Throwing balls, throwing
bullets, all the same to Lloyd.

30:46.725 --> 30:49.751
Looks like we got a
family reunion to catch.

30:50.662 --> 30:54.325
I got there right after 3:00,
but the store was already closed.

30:54.399 --> 30:57.596
I'll go back.
Everything else is set.

30:58.703 --> 31:01.934
You doing your stretches, your
exercises? What's your heart rate at?

31:02.007 --> 31:03.702
I got it to 170
for 20 minutes.

31:03.775 --> 31:07.267
You need to do better. You should
be able to hold that for 30 minutes.

31:07.345 --> 31:08.403
Come on, Dad,
you know I can do it.

31:08.480 --> 31:10.004
You have
to stay sharp.

31:10.982 --> 31:16.579
Everything's on you now,
Son. Don't let me down.

31:17.989 --> 31:19.217
I won't.

31:31.603 --> 31:36.040
Hey, aren't you Lloyd's kid?
Bet he was happy to see you, huh?

31:37.409 --> 31:40.139
Sure he was.
Happy to see his son.

31:40.212 --> 31:41.611
He tell you we found the postcards

31:41.680 --> 31:44.171
he sent to Wade Brownfeld
and that old guy

31:44.249 --> 31:46.547
who helped his friend
kill himself?

31:46.618 --> 31:48.415
The little
buffalo, is that you?

31:48.486 --> 31:51.614
Is that your dad
watching over you?

31:51.690 --> 31:53.214
I've never seen
those before, sir.

31:53.291 --> 31:56.419
He was looking for you
for 12 years, you know.

31:58.496 --> 32:00.896
That made him
an angry man.

32:01.433 --> 32:05.631
I think it pushed him to
commit extreme mistakes.

32:06.972 --> 32:08.599
Dad doesn't
make mistakes.

32:08.673 --> 32:10.038
Here you go, kid.

32:13.311 --> 32:17.839
Oh! Our crime unit cut that piece
out to test it for gunpowder residue.

32:17.916 --> 32:19.816
Yeah, we had them test
the whole knapsack,

32:19.884 --> 32:21.146
you know, while you were
talking to your dad.

32:21.219 --> 32:22.516
Don't worry,
everything's there.

32:22.587 --> 32:24.987
New passport,
even your goji berries.

32:25.056 --> 32:30.084
We're not easing off until we make a
case against both of you for murder.

32:30.996 --> 32:32.054
You'll probably
end up in prison,

32:32.130 --> 32:33.927
but your dad'll face
the death penalty.

32:33.999 --> 32:38.197
You don't want to spare him his
life? You don't want to help him?

32:40.372 --> 32:43.830
Tell us what happened. Like
what you did with the guns.

32:43.908 --> 32:47.207
I don't have
any guns. Sir.

32:52.317 --> 32:54.444
What happened to your...

32:54.519 --> 32:58.546
Do you resent him, did he take you
away from your friends in Provo?

32:58.890 --> 32:59.982
Did you have a girlfriend?

33:00.058 --> 33:05.121
For what? Traveling around the country,
sleeping in a car, living off berries?

33:05.196 --> 33:09.189
Dad knows what's good for me.
He's making me a better person.

33:11.569 --> 33:13.332
Can I please go now?

33:16.074 --> 33:19.908
Did you have something like a
shoulder operation or something?

33:20.211 --> 33:21.235
No.

33:25.517 --> 33:26.506
<i>You need to do better.</i>

33:26.584 --> 33:29.109
<i>You should be able
to hold that for 30 minutes.</i>

33:29.187 --> 33:31.485
<i>Come on, Dad,
you know I can do it.</i>

33:31.623 --> 33:34.183
Wilkes just pushes, and the
kid eats it up like candy.

33:34.259 --> 33:36.352
All this devotion from a
teenage son, it's weird.

33:36.428 --> 33:38.760
Well, it's probably
not his son.

33:39.397 --> 33:45.529
Eric got Erb's Palsy when the doctor used
force to pull him through the birth canal.

33:45.603 --> 33:48.401
Now, it tore the nerves in his neck,
he lost mobility in his shoulder.

33:49.808 --> 33:51.605
Well, he'd have trouble
doing simple things.

33:51.676 --> 33:54.975
Like putting on his backpack,
which this kid didn't.

33:55.046 --> 33:59.506
Well, if this kid isn't Eric Wilkes,
why is Wilkes passing him off as his son?

34:01.386 --> 34:03.684
He had a new
birth certificate.

34:05.790 --> 34:10.022
There was something he said on this
tape, something about a closing.

34:10.795 --> 34:14.322
<i>I got there right after 3:00,
but the store was already closed.</i>

34:15.467 --> 34:17.867
What closes at 3:00,
except a bank?

34:17.936 --> 34:21.235
So, there's a bank account
somewhere with Eric's name on it.

34:21.306 --> 34:22.295
Depending on when
it was set up,

34:22.373 --> 34:24.638
it might be in the
divorce documents.

34:24.708 --> 34:28.668
In the meantime, maybe our friendly
Feds can track down Wilkes' real son.

34:29.179 --> 34:34.344
Here, a bank account in Eric's
name set up by his grandparents.

34:34.418 --> 34:37.320
At the time of the divorce,
it had just over 10 grand.

34:37.389 --> 34:38.481
With the wonder
of compound interest,

34:38.556 --> 34:40.456
there's got to be over
20 grand in there by now.

34:40.525 --> 34:42.049
Lloyd's bail.

34:45.530 --> 34:50.263
I've just been told Lloyd Wilkes' bail
was posted by his son 10 minutes ago.

34:50.335 --> 34:52.132
He'll be back on the street by dinner.

34:52.203 --> 34:54.864
I'm not sure there's anything
we can do to stop him.

34:54.938 --> 34:58.670
I think there is. I pulled
the filings on his divorce.

34:59.043 --> 35:01.773
His wife charged
he physically abused her.

35:01.846 --> 35:04.940
Why didn't you bring up this
serious matter at his arraignment?

35:05.016 --> 35:06.950
It wasn't relevant.

35:07.018 --> 35:09.885
If you file an application
to reconsider the bail amount,

35:09.954 --> 35:12.514
I'll raise it and Mr. Wilkes
will stay where he is.

35:12.590 --> 35:16.026
Your Honor, Mr. Wilkes' lawyer
will see this for what it is,

35:16.094 --> 35:18.722
a dodge to keep
her client locked up.

35:18.797 --> 35:22.130
She'll have a writ of habeas corpus
in front of you within the hour.

35:22.200 --> 35:23.462
And I'll deny her writ.

35:23.535 --> 35:25.264
Then she'll walk it over
to the Appellate Term,

35:25.336 --> 35:27.361
where I have no doubt
it will be granted.

35:27.439 --> 35:29.634
Don't be so sure,
Mr. Carver.

35:29.874 --> 35:32.604
Roland Thibodeaux
was one of their own.

35:34.646 --> 35:36.011
You discussed
this with them?

35:36.080 --> 35:39.516
Wilkes has declared
war on the judiciary.

35:40.018 --> 35:43.681
Who knows how many others are
in this conspiracy with him?

35:43.755 --> 35:45.882
We won't be sitting ducks.

35:45.957 --> 35:49.324
So your answer is to conspire to
suspend his right of habeas corpus?

35:49.394 --> 35:53.353
Get off your high horse, Mr. Carver.
Even Lincoln suspended habeas corpus.

35:53.431 --> 35:56.366
Am I supposed to fall to my knees at
the mention of the Great Emancipator?

35:56.434 --> 35:59.369
Even great men
go too far, Your Honor.

35:59.437 --> 36:01.928
The Supreme Court
rebuffed Lincoln!

36:02.507 --> 36:04.839
You'd rather see
Wilkes go free.

36:05.877 --> 36:09.313
I would love to keep
Mr. Wilkes locked up,

36:09.380 --> 36:11.348
but I love the
Constitution more.

36:14.018 --> 36:16.009
Wilkes' wife changed
her identity twice.

36:16.087 --> 36:18.885
Her trail ends in South
Dakota in a cemetery.

36:18.957 --> 36:23.189
She died in a DUl car accident three
years ago, along with two passengers.

36:23.261 --> 36:26.890
One male, late 40s,
and a young boy.

36:26.965 --> 36:27.954
Her son?

36:28.032 --> 36:29.522
We're still
waiting to hear.

36:29.601 --> 36:32.832
Wilkes tried to contact Eric
as recently as two years ago,

36:32.904 --> 36:34.769
so he might not
know he's dead.

36:34.839 --> 36:37.137
What about the boy
impersonating Eric?

36:37.208 --> 36:38.436
Well, when he got
the money from the bank,

36:38.510 --> 36:39.841
they gave him
a form to fill out.

36:39.911 --> 36:41.674
He gave an address
in Stillwater, Oklahoma.

36:41.746 --> 36:43.543
In the jurisdiction
of Judge Mestres.

36:43.615 --> 36:47.915
This address is for a group
foster home. Closed six years ago.

36:48.586 --> 36:51.555
There was a boy living
there, Clay Turner.

36:51.623 --> 36:54.854
Now, Clay was put in
foster care by Judge Mestres

36:54.926 --> 36:57.053
when his mother went to
jail on a drug charge.

36:57.128 --> 37:00.928
Judge Mestres wouldn't return
the kid to her after she got out.

37:00.999 --> 37:04.958
Clay ended up in Provo last year
on the same street as Wilkes.

37:06.237 --> 37:10.606
Clay, in the foster care home, must've
been starved for attention and discipline

37:10.675 --> 37:12.302
that Wilkes
was dying to give.

37:12.377 --> 37:16.575
Wilkes probably figured the son he'd chose
would be as good as the son he chased.

37:16.648 --> 37:20.379
But, see, he knows he's not
on firm ground with Wilkes.

37:20.451 --> 37:24.251
Panicked in the parking lot when
Wilkes drove off without him.

37:24.889 --> 37:31.488
So you got to wonder, how would he
feel if Eric Wilkes rose from the dead?

37:35.600 --> 37:40.435
Hey. Now, my partner thought you'd be
too embarrassed to wait for your dad.

37:41.639 --> 37:42.867
No, I'm not
embarrassed.

37:42.941 --> 37:46.536
Well, I hope Lloyd knows how
lucky he is to have you around.

37:46.611 --> 37:48.169
I'm the one
who's lucky.

37:48.246 --> 37:51.738
No, today you'd have to
say Lloyd is the lucky one.

37:51.816 --> 37:54.512
We have good news
for him, family news.

37:56.654 --> 37:59.384
You ever thought about
having a brother?

38:01.626 --> 38:05.221
It could be very competitive,
especially when you're looking

38:05.296 --> 38:06.524
for your dad's
attention.

38:06.598 --> 38:07.997
Well, he's going
to play favorites.

38:08.066 --> 38:11.467
I mean, that's
only human nature.

38:14.138 --> 38:16.902
Good going, Son.
You came through.

38:18.710 --> 38:22.612
They giving you trouble? Let's
go see if I get the car back.

38:22.680 --> 38:24.807
You weren't going to tell
him we have good news for him?

38:24.882 --> 38:26.850
What news is that?
It's...

38:26.918 --> 38:30.718
It's about Sandra Kelvin
in South Dakota.

38:30.788 --> 38:32.187
Don't know anybody
by that name.

38:32.256 --> 38:37.091
No, see, you do. Sandra Kelvin's
what your ex-wife changed her name to.

38:37.695 --> 38:38.719
You found Lisa?

38:38.796 --> 38:39.888
In a manner
of speaking.

38:39.964 --> 38:43.730
She died in a car accident outside
Sioux Falls three years ago.

38:43.801 --> 38:46.235
Now, there was two people
in that car with her.

38:46.304 --> 38:49.603
<i>And one of them
was a 14- year-old boy.</i>

38:49.674 --> 38:51.608
And, Lloyd, he survived.

38:51.676 --> 38:53.371
Survived?
Dad.

38:53.444 --> 38:58.074
Now, his name is Justin Kelvin, that would
have been the name that Lisa gave him.

38:58.149 --> 39:01.949
You haven't seen Eric
since he was five years old.

39:03.755 --> 39:05.416
Kids change a lot.

39:07.225 --> 39:10.319
Now, this boy could be trying
to pass himself off as Eric.

39:10.395 --> 39:11.384
No, I'm not.

39:11.462 --> 39:13.657
Don't you worry about it.
I know who he is.

39:13.731 --> 39:19.135
This is Sandra Kelvin's driver's
license. It's your ex, isn't it?

39:19.203 --> 39:21.398
Lloyd, that means
your son is alive.

39:21.472 --> 39:24.168
Lisa looked like a lot
of women. It isn't her.

39:24.242 --> 39:27.336
Look, we can't tell you
where in South Dakota he is,

39:27.412 --> 39:29.039
but with your ex-wife
out of the way now,

39:29.113 --> 39:32.514
you shouldn't have
any trouble finding him.

39:36.154 --> 39:38.987
You see it now, right?
You see it coming.

39:40.591 --> 39:43.458
Soon as he can, he's
heading up to South Dakota.

39:43.528 --> 39:45.496
He won't be able
to help himself.

39:45.563 --> 39:47.724
Stop listening
to him, come on.

39:47.799 --> 39:49.562
Actually, we need
to hold on to him.

39:49.634 --> 39:52.831
He matches the description
of a runaway from Utah.

39:52.904 --> 39:54.667
A kid named Clay Turner.

39:54.739 --> 39:56.468
It's obviously not him.

39:56.541 --> 39:58.771
We'll have everything sorted
out by tomorrow morning.

39:58.843 --> 40:01.676
You can come back
then, Mr. Wilkes.

40:05.416 --> 40:07.850
You hang in there.
I'll be back.

40:07.919 --> 40:08.908
Dad! Don't go.

40:08.986 --> 40:10.112
I'll be back
in the morning.

40:10.188 --> 40:11.883
Don't leave me here.

40:11.956 --> 40:14.823
Get control of yourself.

40:18.029 --> 40:21.658
Look, there is something you
can do to speed up his release.

40:22.133 --> 40:24.101
There's this affidavit?

40:26.337 --> 40:31.934
You can sign it, it's attesting
to him being your son, Eric Wilkes.

40:34.512 --> 40:36.070
Yeah, I can do that.

40:36.147 --> 40:37.478
Well, we got
the form right here.

40:37.548 --> 40:40.016
Now, of course,
if you sign this,

40:40.084 --> 40:43.679
that means the other boy
in South Dakota, well,

40:43.755 --> 40:45.484
it means that
he isn't your son.

40:45.556 --> 40:47.786
And we'll have to send it on
to the authorities up there,

40:47.859 --> 40:49.986
in case you try to
get in touch with him.

40:50.061 --> 40:52.996
I'll talk to the lawyer. She'll
go to court and sort this out.

40:53.064 --> 40:55.658
Oh, I see. Now he wants
to let a judge handle it.

40:55.733 --> 40:56.995
Dad, please sign it.

40:57.068 --> 41:01.630
Once he goes out that door, he's
gone. He's off to South Dakota.

41:07.578 --> 41:09.671
Damn it, boy, come on.

41:22.126 --> 41:23.559
There.

41:25.096 --> 41:26.961
Yeah, that's sincere.

41:27.031 --> 41:30.762
You think this means
anything to him? Come on.

41:31.435 --> 41:35.132
"Daddy, don't leave. Daddy,
please sign it. Daddy, don't go. "

41:35.206 --> 41:38.107
He just wanted to shut
you up! That's all.

41:39.310 --> 41:42.677
This is a guy who doesn't believe
in courts, doesn't believe in judges.

41:42.747 --> 41:45.238
Don't
listen to him.

41:46.918 --> 41:50.012
Just sit tight
till I come back.

41:55.626 --> 41:59.289
There he goes. He's off to
call somebody else "son".

41:59.363 --> 42:01.854
Now, that's something that you
deserve, something that you earned.

42:01.933 --> 42:03.730
Don't leave! I'll
tell them if you leave!

42:03.801 --> 42:05.530
Boy!

42:06.003 --> 42:08.471
I said I'll come
back for you.

42:09.106 --> 42:11.438
Why do you
need anybody else?

42:11.943 --> 42:15.140
He hasn't been the son
that you wanted him to be?

42:16.814 --> 42:18.338
Haven't I, Dad?

42:19.851 --> 42:21.079
You have.

42:22.987 --> 42:24.477
You are.

42:25.923 --> 42:27.481
You don't mean it.

42:29.227 --> 42:31.058
You don't mean it.

42:31.963 --> 42:34.761
You know, there is something
you can do to keep him here.

42:34.832 --> 42:37.062
Something you can do to keep
him from giving that other boy

42:37.134 --> 42:38.999
what belongs to you.

42:39.337 --> 42:40.497
Don't.

42:40.571 --> 42:44.132
Tell us what you did
to deserve to be his son.

42:44.208 --> 42:45.766
Don't you dare.

42:51.482 --> 42:53.279
I helped him kill that judge in Montana.

42:53.351 --> 42:54.943
You're lying!
I killed the judge

42:55.019 --> 42:56.486
who took my family
away from me.

42:56.554 --> 42:59.022
My son! My son wouldn't do this to me.

42:59.090 --> 43:01.684
We killed that judge
in that house.

43:01.759 --> 43:03.317
He taught me
how to use a scope,

43:03.394 --> 43:06.591
to control my breathing, focus myself.

43:06.664 --> 43:08.632
He taught me
how to live!

43:08.833 --> 43:12.496
Lloyd Wilkes, Clay Turner,
you're under arrest for murder.

43:16.173 --> 43:19.631
My son wouldn't do this to me.
I wasted my time on you.

43:22.480 --> 43:25.040
Well, you did
the right thing, Clay.

43:26.117 --> 43:28.915
It was the best time
of my life, you know.

43:30.388 --> 43:33.721
Probably was. Lloyd showed
him a whole new world.

43:35.626 --> 43:40.893
A world of justice without
mercy, that's no place to live.
