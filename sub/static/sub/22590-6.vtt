00:09.552 --> 00:11.429
<i>NARRATOR".
Sunday afternoon in Gotham City.</i>

00:11.596 --> 00:14.641
<i>A day of rest for everyone,
including crime-fighters.</i> ..

00:14.807 --> 00:16.434
<i>...or so it seems.</i>

00:17.393 --> 00:22.190
I was very glad that you could accompany me
to the accordion recital this afternoon, Barbara.

00:22.357 --> 00:25.985
There's nothing I like better than hearing
"Lady of Spain" played eight times.

00:26.152 --> 00:27.529
That is beautiful.

00:27.695 --> 00:30.949
Daddy's been wanting us
to get better acquainted for some time now.

00:31.115 --> 00:33.701
Indeed. Mm.

00:34.410 --> 00:38.122
Time passes very swiftly
with pleasant company.

00:41.501 --> 00:46.089
Would you like to watch
the television news broadcast together?

00:47.423 --> 00:50.301
That's why the shades are drawn, isn't it?

00:53.054 --> 00:56.224
<i>And on</i> a <i>local front,
this news is happening now.</i>

00:56.391 --> 01:00.061
<i>The anonymous informant who has
correctly predicted two prior robberies...</i>

01:00.520 --> 01:01.980
<i>...has added a third.</i>

01:02.146 --> 01:05.191
<i>And this station now knows
who that informant is.</i>

01:05.358 --> 01:09.320
<i>For that live story, we switch controls
to Mobile Unit Number 7.</i>

01:12.490 --> 01:17.787
<i>Ah! Hello out there in television land.</i>

01:17.954 --> 01:20.206
<i>This is King Tut speaking...</i>

01:20.373 --> 01:24.168
<i>...with yet another prediction
of a crime to come.</i>

01:24.627 --> 01:29.716
<i>The police, those sometime guardians
of your life and property...</i>

01:29.882 --> 01:34.095
<i>...have chosen to ignore
my prior prognostications...</i>

01:34.262 --> 01:40.143
<i>...and the results were
two successful criminal actions. Heh.</i>

01:40.310 --> 01:45.940
<i>With that in mind,
here is my third prognostication.</i>

01:46.107 --> 01:50.361
<i>Andrew's Hockey Puck Factory
on West 20th...</i>

01:50.528 --> 01:56.034
<i>...will be robbed
before I finish my next sentence.</i>

02:02.582 --> 02:04.417
Yes, commissioner.

02:04.584 --> 02:07.629
He's not in,
but I can get him in a hurry. Uh-huh.

02:07.795 --> 02:09.714
Uh-huh. Be right there.

02:13.509 --> 02:14.802
What's that?

02:14.969 --> 02:16.638
Oh, it's my wristwatch alarm.

02:16.804 --> 02:21.225
I'm sorry, Barbara, I'd forgotten I have
a meeting at the Wayne Foundation later today.

02:21.392 --> 02:24.103
Oh, don't mention it.
Business before pleasure.

02:24.270 --> 02:27.899
Oh, but you might drop me at my beauty salon.
It's right around the corner.

02:29.000 --> 02:35.074

02:38.326 --> 02:41.120
Thanks, Alfred. Goodbye, Bruce.

02:44.707 --> 02:45.792
Dick, Bruce here.

02:45.958 --> 02:47.418
Commissioner Gordon called.

02:47.585 --> 02:50.797
Our friend the Yale professor
was hit by a brick at a love-in.

02:50.963 --> 02:55.259
He's become King Tut again and
apparently he's up to some nefarious scheme.

04:16.673 --> 04:18.926
Where is the scoundrel currently situated?

04:19.093 --> 04:20.678
Well, he set up shop in a tent...

04:20.845 --> 04:23.723
...in a vacant lot
at the corner of 6th and Albert.

04:23.890 --> 04:27.435
I've been informed he intends predicting
another crime this afternoon.

04:28.144 --> 04:32.190
Let's go, Robin. The longer we tarry,
the more dire the peril.

04:33.024 --> 04:36.736
<i>NARRATOR". Shortly thereafter
in King Tut's current habitat...</i>

04:36.903 --> 04:40.698
...the <i>scurrilous scalawag
is plying his newfound trade...</i>

04:40.865 --> 04:43.743
<i>...to an interested assemblage.</i>

04:44.076 --> 04:49.707
Oh, mystical, magical Prince of Darkness...

04:49.874 --> 04:51.834
."ooh,hoo".

04:52.376 --> 04:57.089
...I invoke your name
and call upon your spirit.

04:57.256 --> 05:02.887
I beseech you to tell me
the time and place of the next robbery.

05:03.262 --> 05:07.058
- In the name of everything that's nasty...
-Pardon me.

05:07.225 --> 05:09.560
...give me your answer, do.

05:14.816 --> 05:18.402
Ladies and gentlemen...

05:18.569 --> 05:22.073
...here is my next prediction.

05:22.240 --> 05:23.825
Come off it, Tut.

05:23.991 --> 05:27.411
Your predictions are nothing
but phony, fatuous flimflam.

05:28.287 --> 05:31.624
Who dares impugn the veracity of Tut...

05:31.791 --> 05:38.130
...Nabob of the Nile,
Moon God of Thoth, and stuff like that?

05:38.297 --> 05:42.844
By the instep of Ramses, I'll have his head!

05:43.678 --> 05:47.765
This is all part of some dastardly trick, Tut.

05:47.932 --> 05:51.310
Why don't you come with me
and let us have your head examined?

05:51.477 --> 05:57.275
Stand back, you Caped Crumbum.
I'm now on your side of the law now.

05:58.359 --> 05:59.610
I'll bet you are.

05:59.777 --> 06:02.697
He is. He's on all sides of the law.

06:03.281 --> 06:05.783
What is going to happen, Tut?

06:05.950 --> 06:08.411
In less than one hour...

06:08.578 --> 06:14.250
...the box office at the Soccer Stadium
will be robbed.

06:14.417 --> 06:20.172
As a citizen of Gotham City,
I would like to see that crime thwarted.

06:20.673 --> 06:25.636
This town can be a better, safer place to live.

06:25.803 --> 06:29.473
I just love better, safer places to live. Ha!

06:29.640 --> 06:33.185
Whether or not you care to act
on this information...

06:33.352 --> 06:37.690
...is of little consequence,
my Dynamic Dum-Dums.

06:37.857 --> 06:41.903
I have cleared my conscience
by reporting to the law.

06:42.069 --> 06:44.822
The rest is up to you.

06:45.823 --> 06:49.118
- Let's go, Robin.
-You mean you really believe him?

06:49.285 --> 06:53.205
Robin, the Constitution provides
that a man is innocent until proven guilty.

06:53.372 --> 06:56.334
And the Constitution is the cornerstone
of our great nation.

06:56.500 --> 06:57.919
We must abide by it.

06:58.085 --> 07:01.923
Gosh, when you put it that way, Batman,
how can I help but agree?

07:04.842 --> 07:06.177
Excuse me.

07:06.844 --> 07:07.845
Good day.

07:08.220 --> 07:11.974
All right, crime fans, that's all for today.

07:12.141 --> 07:16.771
Come back tomorrow
for some brand-new predictions.

07:21.275 --> 07:25.863
Ah! Wasn't I magnificent?

07:26.030 --> 07:27.448
Again. Ha, ha.

07:27.615 --> 07:29.533
Shirley, fan me.

07:29.700 --> 07:33.329
Oh, I am, Tutsy-poo.
These feathers sure came from a heavy ostrich.

07:33.496 --> 07:36.582
Osiris, I want some fruit. Nubis, peel it.

07:36.749 --> 07:39.043
You still haven't told us what your plans are.

07:39.210 --> 07:41.837
Prime your ears.

07:42.004 --> 07:45.967
Your fabulous pharaoh has given
all this free information to the police...

07:46.133 --> 07:48.678
...in order to worm his way
into their confidence.

07:48.844 --> 07:54.600
When the propitious moment arises,
I'll send them on a wild flamingo chase...

07:54.767 --> 07:59.397
...whilst I commit the crime of the century.

07:59.563 --> 08:00.564
Toast it.

08:06.737 --> 08:09.615
Give up without a struggle,
we'll make things easier for you.

08:09.782 --> 08:12.910
If not, you may be severely pummeled
about the head and shoulders.

08:20.084 --> 08:22.586
Hello, Robin. A nice bracelet for you.

08:24.338 --> 08:26.757
And a little something for you, Batman.

08:34.849 --> 08:39.979
<i>NARRATOR". Meanwhile, a seemingly innocent
idle bystander is neither innocent nor idle.</i>

08:51.032 --> 08:54.118
Congratulations. We heard
about the skirmish and rushed right over.

08:54.285 --> 08:57.288
Your timing, as usual,
is flawless, commissioner.

09:00.332 --> 09:04.795
Only a little more time, vassals.
A bit of watchful waiting.

09:04.962 --> 09:07.715
That little blip is the Batmobile.

09:07.882 --> 09:13.304
When it disappears, the Dynamic Dingbats
will have gone into the Batcave.

09:13.471 --> 09:18.059
And as soon as that happens, we'll know
exactly where that accursed place is...

09:18.225 --> 09:21.187
...and have a direct line
on their true identities.

09:25.816 --> 09:30.362
Ah! It's disappeared.
Quickly, coordinates.

09:30.529 --> 09:32.698
- Forty degrees longitude...
- Longitude.

09:32.865 --> 09:34.784
- ...12 minutes north.
- Twelve, north.

09:34.950 --> 09:37.203
- Forty-three degrees latitude...
- Three in the--

09:37.369 --> 09:38.537
...eight minutes east.

09:38.704 --> 09:41.832
East. Carry the four. Ha!

09:42.458 --> 09:47.004
Oh, I'll be a son of a Byzantine king.

09:47.171 --> 09:50.049
- Do you know where that is?
-The zoo?

09:50.216 --> 09:55.262
The Batcave is directly
under stately Wayne Manor.

09:55.429 --> 09:59.058
That means that Bruce Wayne and Batman
are the same and one.

10:04.897 --> 10:08.109
- Where's Alfred?
-He's probably out shopping.

10:08.275 --> 10:11.695
Today is market day and he likes
to take advantage of the specials. Hello.

10:12.404 --> 10:14.406
Hello, Batman.

10:14.573 --> 10:16.700
This is your monarch speaking.

10:17.868 --> 10:20.538
King Tut, and he asked for Batman.

10:20.704 --> 10:23.082
Holy heart failure.

10:24.500 --> 10:27.378
You have the wrong number.
There's no one here by that name.

10:27.545 --> 10:30.047
Come off it, you Caped Cockamamie.

10:30.214 --> 10:33.926
Give it to him, Tutsy.
You've got him by the cowl now.

10:34.093 --> 10:39.306
Ha, ha. Be a good sport, Batman.
Admit you've been outwitted.

10:39.932 --> 10:42.726
My name is Bruce Wayne
and you're calling my residence.

10:42.893 --> 10:45.729
- Now will you please--?
-Of course, you're Bruce Wayne.

10:45.896 --> 10:47.690
You're also Batman.

10:47.857 --> 10:51.569
And Tut's gonna tell it to the whole world
at a press conference tomorrow.

10:51.735 --> 10:53.279
Aren't you, sweetheart?

10:53.445 --> 10:56.282
Yes, indeed, my little delta lotus.

10:56.448 --> 10:58.659
Batman will make you look like a fool.

10:58.826 --> 11:02.246
He and I have met,
but that's the extent of our relationship.

11:02.580 --> 11:04.832
Balderdash, say I.

11:04.999 --> 11:08.627
Stuff and nonsense and phooey.

11:08.794 --> 11:10.921
The only way you'll convince me...

11:11.088 --> 11:14.008
<i>...that Batman and Bruce Wayne
are not the same person...</i>

11:14.466 --> 11:17.595
...is let me see them both simultaneously.

11:17.761 --> 11:21.307
Or both at the same time,
whichever comes first.

11:28.480 --> 11:29.773
<i>NARRATOR".
In the Batcave...</i>

11:29.940 --> 11:33.903
<i>...the Caped Crusaders discover the cause
of their dire dilemma.</i>

11:34.069 --> 11:35.779
What happened?

11:37.740 --> 11:39.241
Ah-ha.

11:42.411 --> 11:44.455
I'm afraid we've been bugged, Robin.

11:49.293 --> 11:52.379
Of course, he's probably the best-known
Egyptologist in his field.

11:52.546 --> 11:54.215
Unfortunately he was hit by a--

11:54.381 --> 11:57.843
<i>♪ accuse.</i>

11:58.010 --> 11:59.678
Poor deluded man.

12:02.181 --> 12:07.102
Ladies and gentlemen of Gotham City...

12:07.269 --> 12:11.649
...I put it to you that Bruce Wayne...

12:11.815 --> 12:17.821
...millionaire playboy and man-about-town...

12:17.988 --> 12:22.618
...is none other than the one...

12:22.785 --> 12:24.912
...the only...

12:25.079 --> 12:27.498
...the original...

12:27.665 --> 12:29.375
...Batman.

12:31.585 --> 12:35.547
I sincerely appreciate
the compliment, King Tut.

12:35.714 --> 12:38.217
I'm not so sure whether Batman would.

12:38.384 --> 12:41.470
Why don't you tell him? He's just outside.

12:43.931 --> 12:47.518
It'd be quite a joke on me, Charlie,
if Batman really were Bruce Wayne.

12:47.685 --> 12:49.270
<i>Perhaps if I move closer...</i>

12:49.436 --> 12:52.940
-...the question might be more easily resolved.
-it's a trick. It's a trick.

12:53.107 --> 12:56.235
As you can see, we don't look
a bit alike, do we, Batman?

12:56.402 --> 12:58.862
Not a bit, Mr. Wayne. Not a bit.

12:59.029 --> 13:00.990
He's not-- He's--

13:01.156 --> 13:03.033
He's fake. Fake.

13:03.200 --> 13:08.080
Tut, why don't you forego this foolishness
and submit yourself for observation?

13:08.247 --> 13:12.960
Once rehabilitated, I'm sure you will become
a valuable member of the community.

13:13.127 --> 13:15.337
He's Batman, all right.

13:15.504 --> 13:19.466
Who else in this present-day dynasty
could be that square?

13:19.633 --> 13:21.885
Goodbye, everybody.

13:22.052 --> 13:26.890
Robin and I must pursue
our relentless war against evil.

13:32.604 --> 13:35.399
- Goodbye, Batman.
-Anyhow, you have to admit it, Charlie...

13:35.566 --> 13:39.069
...the chance of Bruce Wayne being Batman
was a very long shot.

13:39.236 --> 13:42.072
I can't think of two
more obviously opposite people.

13:42.239 --> 13:45.242
Agh. It is written:

13:45.409 --> 13:50.289
"He who knows he has lost has had it."

13:50.456 --> 13:52.333
Goodbye, Mr. Wayne.

13:52.499 --> 13:54.209
- Goodbye, Tut.
-Yes.

13:54.376 --> 13:56.086
Thank you, folks.

14:09.600 --> 14:14.188
That masked moralist thinks
he has me, does he?

14:14.355 --> 14:18.901
He'll soon learn he can't escape
the wrath of the sun king.

14:19.068 --> 14:21.945
We now swing into phase two
of our operation.

14:22.112 --> 14:25.032
- Which is?
-Purloining the priceless collection...

14:25.199 --> 14:28.577
...of Egyptian scrolls
nestled in the Gotham City Library.

14:28.744 --> 14:30.287
- Ha-ha-ha!
-Scrolls?

14:30.454 --> 14:34.375
I thought it was something good,
like crocodile skins or jeweled scorpions.

14:34.541 --> 14:37.795
Button your lip, my little desert partridge.

14:37.961 --> 14:40.381
I said they were priceless, didn't I?

14:40.547 --> 14:42.466
For hidden somewhere within them...

14:42.633 --> 14:47.763
...is the secret of the whereabouts of a statue
hidden since the age of lmhotep.

14:47.930 --> 14:49.640
So, what's with the statue?

14:49.807 --> 14:54.686
The great golden statue of the god Osorkon.

14:54.853 --> 15:00.943
Whoever possesses it, my Aswân damsel,
possesses the universe.

15:01.110 --> 15:03.153
That's a lot of land.

15:04.113 --> 15:08.325
Mama told me to pick
a nice Egyptian girl. Hmph.

15:13.956 --> 15:18.043
Wow, you came down that pole like a pro,
Alfred. I bet you always wanted to do that.

15:18.210 --> 15:21.672
Indeed I have, Master Robin,
but once is enough.

15:21.839 --> 15:25.968
Next time I'll use the elevator
and leave the Batpoles to you.

15:26.135 --> 15:28.303
Any problem with the ersatz
Batman, Robin?

15:28.470 --> 15:32.516
- Holy Gemini, it worked great.
-it's the same principle as a dummy, Alfred.

15:32.683 --> 15:36.770
I used my pocket Bat-synchronizer to
operate the lips, throw in a bit of ventriloquism.

15:36.937 --> 15:38.021
No one was the wiser.

15:38.188 --> 15:42.276
Batmobile drove itself after being programmed
to stop at red lights and intersections.

15:42.443 --> 15:44.862
Was that ever a weird experience.

15:45.028 --> 15:48.198
Alfred, would you put my twin brother
in the Bat-Dummy closet please?

15:48.365 --> 15:49.408
Very good sir.

15:53.036 --> 15:56.206
- Yes, commissioner?
-King Tut has predicted another crime.

15:56.373 --> 15:59.501
- The charlatan.
-He insists all available police...

15:59.668 --> 16:03.547
...surround Gotham City Penitentiary
as a massive escape is in the offing.

16:03.714 --> 16:08.093
Certain forces will attempt to spring
Penguin, Riddler, Egghead, and the Siren.

16:08.260 --> 16:10.888
Get your men out there.
We can't afford to take chances.

16:11.054 --> 16:15.058
But that means the remainder of Gotham City
is wide-open for evildoers.

16:15.225 --> 16:18.103
Robin and I will protect
the balance of the populace.

16:18.812 --> 16:20.481
Eight million people?

16:21.607 --> 16:25.444
- Trust me.
-Of course, Batman.

16:27.237 --> 16:29.823
Get all your men up to
Gotham City Penitentiary at once.

16:29.990 --> 16:32.451
Shouldn't we leave a skeleton force,
commissioner?

16:32.618 --> 16:34.495
Batman suggested it.

16:35.871 --> 16:38.123
Charlie, did you hear what King Tut said?

16:38.290 --> 16:40.167
Well, it was something very interesting.

16:40.334 --> 16:43.420
If the quote he quoted
is the quote I think he quoted...

16:43.587 --> 16:47.174
...I may just have figured out
Tut's entire plot.

16:47.674 --> 16:51.053
It was a mistake only an Egyptian
bibliophile would have noticed.

16:51.220 --> 16:54.097
Lucky I'm an Egyptian bibliophile.

16:57.184 --> 17:00.604
<i>NARRATOR".
Luckily for us, she's an Egyptian bibliophile.</i>

17:00.771 --> 17:02.940
<i>And even luckier, she's Batgirl...</i>

17:03.106 --> 17:07.528
<i>...the supremely feminine scourge
of all that is criminal.</i>

17:08.569 --> 17:10.906
Did you believe that prediction?
Say it isn't so.

17:11.073 --> 17:13.617
I take whatever Tut says
with a ton of salt, Robin.

17:13.784 --> 17:17.454
But there was something he said
which may be a key to his ultimate caper.

17:17.621 --> 17:21.458
He said it to Bruce Wayne. It had
something to do with a quote of some sort.

17:21.625 --> 17:25.253
- I was in the Batmobile at that time.
-Oh, yes, I remember, sir.

17:25.420 --> 17:26.713
What's it all about, Alfred?

17:26.880 --> 17:31.218
It was to the effect that a man
who knows when he has lost has had it.

17:31.385 --> 17:32.886
"Had it."

17:33.387 --> 17:36.348
Of course, it's staring us
right in our masks, Robin.

17:36.515 --> 17:39.518
That quote is on line 769
of chapter 14, scroll 32...

17:39.685 --> 17:42.396
...of the 13th section
of the works of Ramses the Bold.

17:42.563 --> 17:47.484
One of the many ancient and irreplaceable
scrolls at the Gotham City Library.

17:47.651 --> 17:49.236
How could I have missed that one?

17:49.403 --> 17:53.657
And with Gotham City's police out of the way,
he thought he'd have clear sailing.

17:53.824 --> 17:56.285
Let's go, Robin,
and let's hope we're not too late.

17:56.451 --> 17:59.830
The Gotham City Library closed
five minutes ago.

18:08.088 --> 18:09.172
We can still catch them.

18:10.507 --> 18:12.009
Robin, look out.

18:12.175 --> 18:15.762
This librarian has been bound
in the ancient thuggee tradition.

18:15.929 --> 18:19.391
She won't live a minute longer
in that position, Robin.

18:19.683 --> 18:23.729
And when faced with the prospect of choosing
between the apprehension of a criminal...

18:23.895 --> 18:27.733
...and the saving of a human life,
one must always save the life.

18:27.899 --> 18:30.694
Gosh, Batman, you're right again.

18:36.700 --> 18:40.329
- What happened?
-That big hulking brute raced in here...

18:40.495 --> 18:42.789
...and stole our most expensive scrolls.

18:42.956 --> 18:47.753
All the police that usually guard the library
were ordered out on another job.

18:47.919 --> 18:50.047
They said you'd protect us, Batman.

18:50.213 --> 18:52.799
Don't worry. We'll get those scrolls back.

18:52.966 --> 18:57.179
- Doesn't Barbara Gordon work in this library?
-Today is her first day off in a month.

18:57.346 --> 18:59.931
Batman, you've just got to get
those scrolls back.

19:00.098 --> 19:02.809
They are ancient and irreplaceable.

19:02.976 --> 19:04.353
Yes, I know, my dear.

19:04.519 --> 19:06.021
Let's go, Robin.

19:06.188 --> 19:08.357
Frankly, Batman, I'm stumped.

19:08.523 --> 19:10.484
Perhaps a clue will turn up.

19:14.946 --> 19:19.618
Ooh, Tutlings, we have performed
the most marvelous theft.

19:19.993 --> 19:24.915
The golden statue of Osorkon
is almost within our grasp.

19:25.082 --> 19:30.170
Osiris, Nubis, gather up these scrolls
and let's make tracks.

19:30.337 --> 19:33.757
The only tracks you'll be making
are straight to the penitentiary.

19:33.924 --> 19:36.593
- Batgirl.
-In the flesh.

19:37.427 --> 19:40.222
You know, it's against my principles
to beat up on ladies...

19:40.389 --> 19:43.100
...but in your case,
I'll make an exception. Get her.

19:48.522 --> 19:49.773
Agh.

19:49.940 --> 19:52.109
How did you figure out my plan?

19:52.693 --> 19:56.113
Simple. I recognized a quote
from the works of Ramses the Bold...

19:56.279 --> 19:58.824
...and realized then
it was the scrolls you were after.

19:58.990 --> 20:02.953
I got to the library as you escaped
and followed you here.

20:03.578 --> 20:07.541
You know, I can always use a smart girl
in my line of work.

20:07.708 --> 20:11.128
The ones I've had lately
are rather inferior. Would you, uh...?

20:11.294 --> 20:13.046
I'm afraid not.

20:13.213 --> 20:16.717
Batman and Robin will be here momentarily.
I blazed a trail for them.

20:16.883 --> 20:19.970
Consider your criminal career kaput.

20:20.137 --> 20:22.222
Well, heh.

20:22.389 --> 20:24.141
Goodbye, Batgirl.

20:24.516 --> 20:26.143
You're not going anywhere.

20:26.518 --> 20:28.145
No, but you are.

20:30.856 --> 20:32.232
To dreamland.

20:32.399 --> 20:35.110
Defeated by a mere wisp of a girl.

20:35.277 --> 20:38.655
Now, for the second time, let's make tracks.

20:38.822 --> 20:41.241
The only tracks you'll make
are to the penitentiary.

20:41.408 --> 20:43.577
There's some sort of delayed echo in here.

20:43.744 --> 20:48.331
As a duly deputized officer of the law,
it's my duty to advise you of your rights.

20:48.749 --> 20:50.459
You'll have to catch me first.

20:50.625 --> 20:52.002
Get him, get him, get him.

21:34.878 --> 21:38.590
- So it was you who blazed the trail.
-I was just doing my duty as a citizen.

21:38.757 --> 21:40.008
I like that kind of talk.

21:40.175 --> 21:43.970
Perhaps we could get together some evening
and discuss crime-fighting techniques.

21:44.137 --> 21:45.764
No one knows where you live.

21:45.931 --> 21:48.225
Yes, that does constitute
somewhat of a problem.

21:48.391 --> 21:50.060
Look out. Here they come again.

22:13.583 --> 22:16.419
Batgirl never stays around
long enough for us to thank her.

22:16.586 --> 22:18.755
She's probably very modest.

22:19.422 --> 22:21.508
I wonder who she really is.

22:22.217 --> 22:25.053
I wonder who he really is.

22:29.140 --> 22:35.438
I'm afraid it will be a long siege of analysis
before you realize who you actually are.

22:35.605 --> 22:40.569
I've lived a thousand years,
so I'll live another thousand.

22:40.735 --> 22:42.612
- Hi, Daddy. Hello, Bruce.
-Hi.

22:42.779 --> 22:44.781
Good to see you again, Barbara.

22:45.323 --> 22:49.578
I wonder if we could, um, continue
that date we interrupted this weekend.

22:49.953 --> 22:54.833
Hey, you mean you actually had a date
with this socialite lump?

22:55.000 --> 22:56.293
Yes. Why?

22:56.459 --> 22:59.337
Because he's so deadly dull.

22:59.504 --> 23:01.798
Deadly dull, that's what it is.

23:01.965 --> 23:05.010
Just deadly dull in Gotham City.

23:20.984 --> 23:23.820
What did I say? Deadly dull?

23:26.364 --> 23:29.075
Yes. What?

23:29.701 --> 23:32.662
You don't say. You don't say.

23:34.581 --> 23:37.000
You don't say.

23:37.459 --> 23:39.294
- Who was it?
-Who was it?

23:40.170 --> 23:42.797
He didn't say. What his name was, that is.

23:42.964 --> 23:46.301
But it was the patrolman
at the corner of Plat and Green Street.

23:46.468 --> 23:52.474
And he just saw that notorious gangster
Louie the Lilac drive by in his Flowermobile.

23:52.641 --> 23:54.517
Well, that's my cue to leave.

23:54.684 --> 23:56.603
Yeah! Ha-ha-ha!

23:56.770 --> 23:58.772
That's what I said!

23:58.939 --> 24:02.692
He's gonna go straight to the Batcave
and put on that corny blue outfit.

24:02.859 --> 24:07.030
Actually, I had something more
mundane in mind, King Tut.

24:07.197 --> 24:11.451
I've had so much crime in the last two days,
I don't care if I ever see it again.

24:11.618 --> 24:13.536
- Goodbye, Barbara.
-Bye.

24:13.703 --> 24:14.746
Commissioner Gordon.

24:15.705 --> 24:17.290
Bye, Bruce.

24:18.541 --> 24:20.085
Nice young man, isn't he?

24:20.251 --> 24:22.003
I think I'm gonna be sick.

24:22.170 --> 24:24.214
Bruce Wayne's nice enough, Daddy.

24:24.381 --> 24:26.216
But he's certainly no Batman.

24:26.800 --> 24:29.219
You wanna wager a sphinx or two?

24:29.844 --> 24:33.181
Commissioner, weren't you
gonna call somebody?

24:33.348 --> 24:34.766
Was I?

24:35.016 --> 24:37.435
Ah, uh, Batman.
