[whimpering]

00:25.901 --> 00:27.069
[gasps]

00:27.152 --> 00:28.696
[panting]

03:10.774 --> 03:12.776
[theme music playing]

04:36.026 --> 04:37.820
[alarm beeping]

04:43.741 --> 04:47.079
-[alarm turns off]
-[automated voice] Seven o'clock a.m.

05:04.387 --> 05:05.763
[grunting]

05:10.727 --> 05:12.062
[sighs]

05:32.749 --> 05:34.167
[Karen] Matt wouldn't understand.

05:34.251 --> 05:36.336
You know what he would say.

05:37.295 --> 05:38.421
That we're awesome?

05:38.505 --> 05:41.174
[scoffs] No, that we're being stupid.

05:41.258 --> 05:43.551
I prefer the term
"foolheartedly provocative."

05:43.635 --> 05:46.471
Yeah, that's lawyer talk for stupid.
You want coffee?

05:48.056 --> 05:49.307
If we're gonna be
Nancy Drew-ing together,

05:49.391 --> 05:52.144
I think a certain level
of honesty is required.

05:52.227 --> 05:53.896
What? You don't like my coffee?

05:53.979 --> 05:55.647
-No, I hate it.
-[Karen exclaims]

05:55.730 --> 05:59.192
I appreciate the effort,
but the technique, or lack thereof--

05:59.276 --> 06:00.903
[laughing]
My God, you are such a dick.

06:00.986 --> 06:03.906
On occasion some dickery may leak out,
but doesn't mean I'm wrong.

06:03.989 --> 06:05.282
Well, it means somethin'.

06:05.365 --> 06:07.159
Okay, let's say
we keep Matt in the dark.

06:07.242 --> 06:08.618
How long do you think--

06:08.701 --> 06:10.078
[door opening]

06:10.162 --> 06:12.664
I should grow my hair?
Matt, what's your take on that?

06:12.747 --> 06:14.666
-Mullet? Full pony?
-[Karen] Holy shit.

06:14.749 --> 06:16.168
-Did you fall down again?
-[Matt] Oh, it's nothing.

06:16.251 --> 06:18.921
-Don't tell me what?
-Damn it!

06:19.004 --> 06:20.172
[Karen] You heard that?

06:20.255 --> 06:21.714
Guy's like a bat.

06:21.798 --> 06:24.842
Not blind like a--
I mean, you know, with the hearing.

06:24.927 --> 06:26.511
-Bats aren't blind, Foggy.
-They're not?

06:26.594 --> 06:27.637
It's a myth.

06:28.430 --> 06:29.431
So, we're good.

06:30.390 --> 06:31.516
-Karen.
-Yeah?

06:31.599 --> 06:34.602
What don't the two of you
want me to know?

06:36.939 --> 06:38.731
We're investigating Union Allied.

06:38.815 --> 06:40.858
Remind me to keep you
off the witness stand.

06:40.943 --> 06:42.444
-You can't be doing that.
-Why not?

06:42.527 --> 06:45.030
For starters, you signed legal papers
and took money to leave it alone.

06:45.113 --> 06:48.658
No, I signed papers saying that
I wouldn't go public and I won't.

06:48.741 --> 06:51.536
-We have someone lined up for that part.
-What part?

06:53.288 --> 06:55.248
Breaking the story that, uh...

06:55.332 --> 06:58.626
Look, whoever is behind Union Allied,
or whatever they call themselves now,

06:58.710 --> 07:01.588
they are trying to
strong-arm people like Elena

07:01.671 --> 07:04.091
so that they can sweep
their homes away from them

07:04.174 --> 07:05.800
and build condos no one can afford.

07:05.883 --> 07:07.010
And what do you
think's gonna happen

07:07.094 --> 07:09.262
when these "whoevers"
find out what it is you're up to?

07:09.346 --> 07:11.889
-We already took care of it.
-Took care of what?

07:13.391 --> 07:17.062
The, uh, guys who busted up
Elena's apartment.

07:17.145 --> 07:20.690
They, uh, came after me
when I was leaving her place last night.

07:20.773 --> 07:21.774
Are you okay?

07:21.858 --> 07:23.068
[Karen] Yes.

07:23.151 --> 07:25.570
Foggy was following me.

07:25.653 --> 07:28.198
-Mmm-hmm. Why? Why were you following her?
-She was acting funny.

07:28.281 --> 07:30.575
-No, there was no funny.
-There was a little funny.

07:30.658 --> 07:33.411
This is what I'm talking about.
There are things out there.

07:33.495 --> 07:35.413
You can't be doing this.
You're gonna get yourselves hurt.

07:35.497 --> 07:38.833
No, I have already been hurt
by those bastards.

07:39.876 --> 07:42.087
You know, I don't care what I signed

07:42.170 --> 07:44.631
or how much money
they paid me to forget. I don't.

07:44.714 --> 07:46.341
And I'm not just going to
stick my head in the sand

07:46.424 --> 07:50.303
and let it happen to somebody else
because I am scared.

07:50.387 --> 07:53.223
Which I am... a lot.

07:54.975 --> 07:57.560
And if you could see her face,
you'd know she means it.

07:57.644 --> 07:59.312
Yeah, I kind of got that.

08:03.316 --> 08:05.110
[stammering]
Right, who else is involved?

08:05.193 --> 08:08.613
Who's helping you break whatever it is
you think you're gonna find out?

08:08.696 --> 08:10.573
Ben Urich, from the Bulletin.

08:10.657 --> 08:13.160
The one who wrote
the Union Allied piece?

08:13.243 --> 08:15.328
Karen's been working with him.
He seems like a good guy.

08:15.412 --> 08:17.872
[laughs] Yeah, everybody does,
until they aren't.

08:17.955 --> 08:20.833
No, I trust Ben as much as
I do you or Foggy, Matt.

08:20.917 --> 08:23.711
I know what I am doing.
I am not some kid--

08:23.795 --> 08:26.798
Then don't act like one.
Both of you.

08:27.924 --> 08:29.634
I know you're just trying
to do the right thing here,

08:29.717 --> 08:30.927
but we have to be smart about this.

08:31.011 --> 08:32.012
We?

08:32.095 --> 08:35.515
First rule, no more skulking around,
asking to get hurt.

08:35.598 --> 08:38.476
We do this, it's gonna be on our turf.
The legal system.

08:38.560 --> 08:40.520
That's not nearly
as heroic as you might think.

08:40.603 --> 08:43.023
I don't want anyone to be a hero, Karen.
I want you to be safe.

08:43.106 --> 08:45.858
And I want to protect this firm
and everything we're trying to build here.

08:45.942 --> 08:49.154
We know the law.
We'll use it to our advantage.

08:50.613 --> 08:51.614
Agreed?

08:52.865 --> 08:53.950
Do we have a choice?

08:54.742 --> 08:56.078
Not so much.

08:57.120 --> 08:59.914
[inhales]
Yeah, okay.

08:59.997 --> 09:01.291
So, what's the second rule?

09:03.126 --> 09:05.878
I don't know,
I'm making this up as I go along.

09:10.050 --> 09:13.803
I understand your position.
You need to understand mine!

09:13.886 --> 09:15.930
[speaking Japanese]

09:17.057 --> 09:19.892
[Wesley speaking English] He questions
the validity of your position.

09:19.976 --> 09:23.480
I say it is of piss and shit.

09:24.522 --> 09:28.151
Well, I'm sorry you feel that way.
Nevertheless, my point is valid.

09:28.235 --> 09:31.238
You made guarantees.

09:31.321 --> 09:33.365
-[Fisk] Which I met.
-The Black Sky is dead.

09:33.448 --> 09:37.660
You asked that the docks
and your transit path

09:37.744 --> 09:39.746
be clear of police interference.

09:39.829 --> 09:43.750
-Did you observe any police?
-[sighs]

09:44.542 --> 09:45.543
No.

09:45.627 --> 09:48.004
Of course not,
because I'm a man of honor!

09:48.088 --> 09:50.965
It will be difficult
to locate another Black Sky.

09:51.048 --> 09:53.885
They are extremely rare.

09:53.968 --> 09:56.888
Perhaps you should have told me
the importance of your cargo

09:56.971 --> 09:59.266
before you lost it.

10:01.434 --> 10:03.145
[speaking Japanese]

10:07.399 --> 10:09.109
[speaking English]
He's asking if you'd like to renegotiate

10:09.192 --> 10:11.236
the terms of your relationship.

10:11.319 --> 10:12.904
I'm...

10:15.282 --> 10:17.033
sorry if I offended you.

10:17.117 --> 10:19.202
My apologies.

10:21.413 --> 10:23.123
[speaking Japanese]

10:36.636 --> 10:38.388
-[door closes]
-[sighs]

10:39.931 --> 10:41.266
You get that last part?

10:41.349 --> 10:44.769
Yes, threats are clear
in any language.

10:45.853 --> 10:47.272
He needs to be
taught some manners.

10:47.355 --> 10:48.856
Leave it alone.

10:49.899 --> 10:51.693
If the Russians had
spoken to you this way--

10:51.776 --> 10:53.445
They aren't the Russians.

10:53.528 --> 10:55.988
No, the Russians actually contributed.

10:56.072 --> 10:58.408
Leland's financials, Gao's product,

10:58.491 --> 11:02.829
and Vlad and Anatoly's distribution
until we absorbed that facet.

11:04.206 --> 11:05.623
What do Nobu and his men
bring to the table?

11:05.707 --> 11:08.793
What-- What are they in all this?

11:08.876 --> 11:10.587
A necessary evil.

11:11.629 --> 11:15.342
I just-- I don't like the way
he speaks to you, that's all.

11:15.425 --> 11:18.511
Especially now,
when everything's going our way.

11:19.429 --> 11:22.724
That's exactly when
you need to be cautious.

11:29.356 --> 11:30.857
[indistinct talking]

11:41.158 --> 11:43.328
[car horn honking]

11:53.505 --> 11:55.715
[rock music playing on radio]

11:58.217 --> 12:00.011
[Marlene] Can you please turn that down?

12:01.429 --> 12:03.556
Your mom don't like music.

12:06.393 --> 12:08.603
-I like it.
-That's 'cause you got taste.

12:08.686 --> 12:10.563
I love music.
Just not so loud.

12:10.647 --> 12:13.024
What the hell good is it
if you can't hear it?

12:13.107 --> 12:14.567
-Right, Willie?
-Right!

12:14.651 --> 12:15.985
Never trust the quiet ones.

12:16.068 --> 12:18.655
Those are the pricks
that are always up to something.

12:20.698 --> 12:22.074
You cut it too short.

12:22.158 --> 12:23.826
What did I tell you?

12:23.910 --> 12:24.952
Sorry.

12:25.036 --> 12:26.454
Sorry, what?

12:26.538 --> 12:27.997
Sir.

12:28.915 --> 12:31.293
Respect.
You gotta give it if you want it.

12:31.376 --> 12:33.420
Don't forget that.

12:33.503 --> 12:34.921
Make the next one longer.

12:35.004 --> 12:37.173
You want your pop's face in the dirt?

12:37.256 --> 12:38.466
-No, sir.
-Damn right.

12:44.347 --> 12:47.183
You see that?
That's our ticket.

12:47.266 --> 12:48.935
Once you get on the city council,

12:49.018 --> 12:51.479
everybody wants to put
a little somethin' in your pocket.

12:52.397 --> 12:54.899
Remember Mr. Flores
from up the street?

12:54.982 --> 12:56.526
-No.
-[Bill] 'Course not.

12:56.609 --> 12:58.361
You know why?
'Cause he got on the council

12:58.445 --> 12:59.654
back when you were
still shitting in your pants.

12:59.737 --> 13:01.155
Bill!

13:01.238 --> 13:02.490
But he ain't around no more.

13:02.574 --> 13:07.495
One year after he got voted in,
packed up, got himself a real house.

13:07.579 --> 13:08.746
Really?

13:08.830 --> 13:10.332
Just like we're gonna buy.

13:13.418 --> 13:15.920
This city?
It's everything.

13:16.629 --> 13:17.922
It's right there.

13:18.715 --> 13:21.884
All you gotta do is put your mind to it
and make it happen.

13:24.512 --> 13:25.513
You want a sip?

13:25.597 --> 13:26.681
-He most certainly does not.
-[Bill] Huh?

13:26.764 --> 13:30.477
My dad let me take a sip from his glass
before I could talk. Go on.

13:32.604 --> 13:34.356
Go on.
What are you lookin' at her for?

13:34.439 --> 13:36.358
I said it's okay.
Take a big one.

13:37.817 --> 13:39.193
Go on.

13:41.738 --> 13:42.780
That's it.

13:42.864 --> 13:45.867
-Bill, what are you doing? Jesus!
-[coughing]

13:45.950 --> 13:48.453
Come on, it's funny.
He's a man.

13:48.536 --> 13:49.579
Let him be a man.

13:49.662 --> 13:52.415
-You worry too much.
-[Marlene] Somebody has to.

13:53.332 --> 13:54.459
How are we paying for all this?

13:59.756 --> 14:01.716
Got it covered.
I took a loan.

14:01.799 --> 14:03.050
A loan?

14:03.134 --> 14:06.137
-What'd the bank make you put up?
-No, no, no. Screw the bank.

14:06.220 --> 14:07.221
Rigoletto floated me.

14:07.304 --> 14:09.849
-[Marlene] Rigoletto?
-Who's that?

14:09.932 --> 14:13.603
[Bill] Nobody, forget it.
It's an investment, Marlene.

14:13.686 --> 14:16.606
You gotta spend money to make money.

14:16.689 --> 14:19.734
Once I get on the council,
this is all taken care of.

14:19.817 --> 14:22.737
-I don't know about all this.
-You don't know about nothin'!

14:22.820 --> 14:24.614
You gotta take risks.

14:24.697 --> 14:27.867
You want something out of life,
you gotta put yourself out there.

14:27.950 --> 14:30.745
You gotta put yourself out there, Mom!

14:30.828 --> 14:34.416
[chuckling] You see?
The kid is smarter than you.

14:40.547 --> 14:42.298
Yes, honestly.

14:42.382 --> 14:46.428
I've spent most of my time
abroad in Asia.

14:46.511 --> 14:47.512
Yes.

14:47.595 --> 14:49.263
I would.

14:50.557 --> 14:52.058
-Maybe, we--
-[cell phone chimes]

14:53.059 --> 14:54.686
-We--
-[chiming continues]

14:54.769 --> 14:56.938
Could you please hold on a second?

15:00.107 --> 15:01.401
Wait. [scoffs]

15:04.404 --> 15:08.157
I'm so sorry.
I need to take this.

15:09.992 --> 15:13.455
I know, me, too.
Good night, Vanessa.

15:16.290 --> 15:17.291
Yes?

15:17.374 --> 15:19.752
We have a situation.

15:19.836 --> 15:22.714
-[Fisk] Nobu?
-Detective Blake, he just woke up.

15:22.797 --> 15:26.718
Our contacts in the media tell us
that it's gonna be tonight's lead.

15:26.801 --> 15:29.721
Has he said anything
we need to be concerned about?

15:29.804 --> 15:32.515
No, he's conscious,
but his injuries were extensive.

15:32.599 --> 15:33.891
I'm hearing he can't speak yet.

15:33.975 --> 15:35.643
That changes,

15:35.727 --> 15:38.312
unlikely he's gonna be overjoyed
we had him shot.

15:38.395 --> 15:39.396
Yes.

15:39.481 --> 15:40.815
Well...

15:42.525 --> 15:43.651
take care of him.

15:43.735 --> 15:46.028
That poses an issue.

15:46.112 --> 15:49.115
There's a detail on his floor.
Twenty-four hour presence,

15:49.198 --> 15:51.701
in case the man in the mask
tries to finish the job.

15:51.784 --> 15:53.453
Are any of them ours?

15:53.536 --> 15:57.457
Two... but not on the door.
They try to get in, it'll be noticed.

16:01.794 --> 16:03.880
What about his partner, Hoffman?

16:03.963 --> 16:08.425
I can reach out, but they go back,
since before the academy. I, uh...

16:08.510 --> 16:10.762
I doubt he'll be receptive.

16:10.845 --> 16:12.221
Set a meeting...

16:13.222 --> 16:15.307
and I'll speak with him myself.

16:15.391 --> 16:16.809
Understood.

16:21.564 --> 16:23.483
This is pointless, Matt.

16:23.566 --> 16:27.111
We should be out on the streets,
cracking names and taking skulls.

16:27.194 --> 16:29.947
-I think you have that backwards.
-Not the way I do it.

16:30.031 --> 16:33.159
[Matt laughing] Five minutes out there
and you'd end up in intensive care.

16:33.242 --> 16:35.620
Hey, I handled myself
pretty damn skippy

16:35.703 --> 16:37.830
against baldy
and his tattooed gorilla.

16:37.914 --> 16:39.206
-Tell him, K.
-No, you did.

16:39.290 --> 16:41.584
What? I'm--
What, I'm "K" now?

16:41.668 --> 16:43.878
-Trying something new.
-Mmm-mmm. Don't.

16:43.961 --> 16:44.962
[Matt] Wait, this is interesting.

16:46.589 --> 16:48.424
Confederated Global Investments.

16:48.508 --> 16:51.636
The company that hired us
to defend that bowling alley nut?

16:51.719 --> 16:53.470
Yeah. Karen, do you have
a list of the subsidiaries

16:53.555 --> 16:55.056
you were able to track down
through their check?

16:55.139 --> 16:57.474
Uh, yeah, yeah, I think so.

16:58.935 --> 17:00.019
Yeah, yeah, I got it.

17:00.102 --> 17:02.146
Can you tell me if...

17:04.315 --> 17:07.151
Westmeyer-Holt Contracting
is on the list?

17:07.234 --> 17:09.821
Um...

17:09.904 --> 17:11.739
Yeah. Yeah, it is.

17:11.823 --> 17:13.449
There are half a dozen
complaints against them

17:13.533 --> 17:15.660
for doing the same thing
they did at Elena's tenement.

17:15.743 --> 17:18.079
Confed Global's trying to force
renters out of tenements?

17:18.162 --> 17:20.790
[stuttering] What about Elena's landlord?
That Tully guy?

17:20.873 --> 17:22.709
I mean, he's gotta know
something about this.

17:22.792 --> 17:24.627
-See if I can track him down.
-[Matt] Use the phone.

17:24.711 --> 17:25.712
Oh, come on!

17:25.795 --> 17:27.589
-I'm making that rule number two.
-[Foggy] Your rules suck.

17:27.672 --> 17:30.382
-I want that on record.
-[Matt] Fine, noted.

17:30.466 --> 17:31.508
Oh, my God.

17:31.593 --> 17:34.011
-What do you got?
-Uh, no, it's not, um--

17:34.095 --> 17:35.471
The New York Bulletin online

17:35.555 --> 17:39.559
just reported that that cop that got shot,
he just regained consciousness.

17:39.642 --> 17:40.852
-Detective Blake?
-[Karen] Yeah.

17:40.935 --> 17:41.936
[Foggy] Guy's a real dick.

17:42.019 --> 17:44.564
Still, he didn't deserve a bullet
from that masked douchebag.

17:44.647 --> 17:47.650
Okay. [laughs] Nobody knows
what really happened out there.

17:47.734 --> 17:49.151
[Matt] Detective Blake might.

17:49.235 --> 17:50.862
Be interested in what he has to say.

17:50.945 --> 17:53.114
Yeah, so would I.

17:53.197 --> 17:54.907
[Fisk] We can't allow this to happen.

17:55.908 --> 18:00.412
I know that you have...
feelings regarding this matter.

18:00.496 --> 18:02.498
I respect that.

18:04.500 --> 18:09.756
But if Detective Blake
chooses to speak out of turn...

18:11.716 --> 18:16.512
the result would be... unpleasant,
for you and for me.

18:16.596 --> 18:19.223
Out of turn? You shot him.

18:20.224 --> 18:23.811
Technically, we paid
someone else to shoot him.

18:24.854 --> 18:27.148
Do you know what made us
go down this path?

18:27.231 --> 18:31.068
What led to a decision of such finality?

18:31.152 --> 18:34.113
If you're worried about me,
I know how to keep my mouth shut.

18:34.196 --> 18:37.659
If we doubted that,
we wouldn't be having this conversation.

18:38.785 --> 18:40.662
[Fisk] Being informed...

18:41.495 --> 18:43.831
knowing facts as they are...

18:45.541 --> 18:48.044
not how we wish to perceive them,

18:48.127 --> 18:52.924
can tip the balance
between life and death.

18:53.841 --> 18:58.095
Unlike you, your partner was
inconsistent in his attention to detail.

18:58.179 --> 19:01.015
Well, that masked asshole
beat him senseless and broke his arm.

19:01.098 --> 19:02.474
It wasn't his fault.

19:02.558 --> 19:06.520
[Fisk] Yes, I forgave him for that.
What I find indefensible...

19:06.603 --> 19:09.190
is we were not alerted...

19:09.273 --> 19:13.235
that the addresses we provided
had been compromised.

19:13.319 --> 19:18.324
They were given to ensure that
any Russian who survived the bombings

19:18.407 --> 19:21.661
would be properly attended to.

19:21.744 --> 19:26.123
Not to aid the man in the mask
at locating Vladimir Ranskahov.

19:27.041 --> 19:29.752
That led to an unfortunate complication.

19:30.753 --> 19:35.758
One that your partner
was directly responsible for.

19:35.842 --> 19:37.844
[sighs] Yeah.

19:39.095 --> 19:41.973
So, how long before
I do something that pisses you off?

19:42.056 --> 19:45.517
Oh, the answer to that
is entirely up to you.

19:52.233 --> 19:56.028
See, he's more than my partner, right?

19:56.112 --> 19:57.905
He's my friend.

19:57.989 --> 20:01.868
I've known him since I was a kid.
That's 30, 35 years.

20:10.417 --> 20:12.044
How much...

20:13.087 --> 20:15.589
are each of those years worth to you?

20:16.590 --> 20:17.633
Hmm?

20:17.717 --> 20:20.219
In round figures?

20:35.902 --> 20:37.444
[indistinct talking]

21:07.266 --> 21:08.267
-Hey.
-Hey.

21:08.350 --> 21:09.351
Good news, right?

21:09.435 --> 21:11.062
Yeah, he always was
a tough son of a bitch.

21:11.145 --> 21:13.439
[laughs] Yeah.
Hey, you gotta sign in.

21:13.522 --> 21:15.357
Oh, yeah, sure, sure.

21:18.235 --> 21:20.822
-And I gotta check the bag.
-Yeah.

21:24.366 --> 21:25.659
Mmm, meatball?

21:25.742 --> 21:27.744
Yeah, from Marchioni's.
He loves that place.

21:27.829 --> 21:29.872
I don't know,
I thought it might trigger something.

21:29.956 --> 21:31.415
-Yeah. Well, come on in.
-Thanks.

21:38.965 --> 21:40.549
[monitor beeping]

21:44.511 --> 21:45.762
[door closes]

22:03.322 --> 22:04.448
I'm sorry.

22:17.753 --> 22:18.921
[grunts]

22:21.590 --> 22:22.842
What are you doin'?

22:22.925 --> 22:23.968
[syringe clatters]

22:26.637 --> 22:28.222
[grunts]

22:28.890 --> 22:30.057
[coughing]

22:41.610 --> 22:43.445
[Blake breathing raggedly]

22:54.790 --> 22:58.252
I need you to listen to me.
We don't have much time.

22:58.335 --> 23:00.712
Whatever your partner
just injected you with

23:00.796 --> 23:02.464
has already reached your heart.

23:03.966 --> 23:05.509
You're gonna be dead soon.

23:05.592 --> 23:06.885
And there's nothing
anyone can do about it.

23:06.969 --> 23:07.970
[machine beeping rapidly]

23:08.054 --> 23:10.889
But you can make the man responsible
for this pay for what he's done.

23:10.973 --> 23:11.974
[monitor beeping rapidly]

23:12.058 --> 23:13.100
-[banging on door]
-[Brett] Hoffman!

23:13.184 --> 23:15.227
Tell me everything
you know about Wilson Fisk.

23:15.311 --> 23:17.063
[breathing raggedly]

23:17.146 --> 23:20.607
-[officer] Hoffman! Open the door!
-[Blake mumbling] Is it my turn for this?

23:20.691 --> 23:21.733
-[door rattling]
-[officer shouting]

23:21.817 --> 23:23.402
Hoffman, what the hell
is going on in there?

23:24.861 --> 23:26.113
[Blake gasping]

23:28.824 --> 23:30.242
-[officer 1] Go! Go!
-[officer 2] Get in there!

23:30.326 --> 23:31.660
Move, move, move!

23:33.329 --> 23:34.956
-Move!
-Come on! Let's go!

23:35.039 --> 23:36.915
-Go!
-[monitor flatlining]

23:41.087 --> 23:45.507
Look at my face.
I can't go into the office like this.

23:45.591 --> 23:49.178
I'm afraid to go anywhere with
that masked psychopath running around.

23:50.429 --> 23:52.389
My son was coming to visit.

23:52.473 --> 23:53.640
I had to tell him,

23:53.724 --> 23:56.978
"Nope, stay out of New York, Lee.
Shit's goin' on."

23:57.061 --> 23:59.521
I'm 73 years old.

23:59.605 --> 24:02.066
You know how many times
I have left to see him?

24:02.984 --> 24:05.111
I apologize for the
inconvenience, Leland.

24:05.194 --> 24:07.654
I'm not looking for--
Are you done?

24:07.738 --> 24:09.573
This thing itches
like a son of a bitch.

24:09.656 --> 24:11.325
It'll keep you safe when he's finished.

24:12.451 --> 24:14.828
What's this coated with?

24:14.911 --> 24:18.374
Polyethylene, glycol, silicate.

24:18.457 --> 24:22.794
-Hydro-clusters form when kinetic energy--
-Yeah, great. I'm a 46" long.

24:23.712 --> 24:26.340
-That'll be all, Mr. Potter.
-Okay.

24:27.841 --> 24:30.136
You need anything else, Mr. Fisk, sir?

24:30.219 --> 24:32.971
-Not today, Mr. Potter. Thank you.
-Okay.

24:35.141 --> 24:36.350
[Leland clears throat]

24:37.684 --> 24:38.727
Kid's half an idiot.

24:39.645 --> 24:41.688
It's the other half that counts.

24:41.772 --> 24:42.773
So...

24:42.856 --> 24:46.568
what am I supposed to do here?
Seriously?

24:46.652 --> 24:47.778
He knows who I am.

24:47.861 --> 24:51.448
He found me once,
he'll do it again.

24:51.532 --> 24:55.494
I'll move you someplace safe
until it's resolved.

24:55.577 --> 24:58.289
-I'll put six men on you.
-Make it a dozen.

24:58.372 --> 24:59.706
If he drops me off a roof,

24:59.790 --> 25:02.209
an awful lot of money
is going along for the ride.

25:02.293 --> 25:05.962
-That sounds like a threat.
-No, just stating the obvious.

25:06.880 --> 25:08.757
Never thought I'd have to with you.

25:08.840 --> 25:10.592
[footsteps approaching]

25:15.389 --> 25:16.765
Is it taken care of?

25:16.848 --> 25:18.642
Yes, but there was a complication.

25:18.725 --> 25:22.354
Well, there's a word
I'm hearing more and more.

25:22.438 --> 25:23.564
[sighs] What happened?

25:23.647 --> 25:25.566
Right after Hoffman injected Blake,

25:25.649 --> 25:28.485
he was incapacitated
by our masked friend.

25:28.569 --> 25:30.654
When Blake was still alive?

25:30.737 --> 25:32.489
And talking, according to Hoffman.

25:32.573 --> 25:36.034
[Leland chuckles]
That's great. That's wonderful.

25:36.118 --> 25:37.119
So we have no idea

25:37.203 --> 25:40.456
what the guy you had shot
might have said to the whack job

25:40.539 --> 25:42.208
you had framed for it?

25:43.250 --> 25:45.669
-No, but there is an upside.
-Mmm-hmm.

25:45.752 --> 25:47.296
[Wesley] Hoffman was able to spin it.

25:47.379 --> 25:50.382
Told everyone he was assaulted
by the man in the mask,

25:50.466 --> 25:51.967
then he finished
what he started with Blake.

25:52.050 --> 25:53.927
So we're not exposed on that front.

25:54.010 --> 25:57.223
Well, let's have a parade.

25:57.306 --> 25:59.975
This guy, Hoffman,
how much does he know?

26:01.143 --> 26:02.519
We're taking care of it, Leland.

26:02.603 --> 26:05.439
Well, that fills me with warm comfort.

26:07.733 --> 26:10.777
Situation's being handled, all right.

26:10.861 --> 26:12.613
Just not by you.

26:14.906 --> 26:17.118
[Marlene]
You're gonna be all right, Wilson.

26:17.743 --> 26:19.203
It's okay, honey.

26:19.286 --> 26:21.705
-Have some Zuppa, okay?
-[sniffling]

26:21.788 --> 26:23.790
-I'm not hungry.
-You eat it.

26:23.874 --> 26:25.501
It'll make you feel better.

26:26.877 --> 26:29.963
-Are you having some?
-Sure, baby.

26:38.847 --> 26:40.056
[Marlene] Mmm.

26:42.226 --> 26:45.521
Do you think it's true?
What Bernie said?

26:47.606 --> 26:48.732
You can't listen to people like that.

26:48.815 --> 26:51.402
You have to just block them out.

26:51.485 --> 26:52.694
[coughing]

26:53.862 --> 26:55.071
The hell happened to you?

26:55.156 --> 26:56.948
It's all right, I've got this.

26:58.742 --> 27:00.494
You feed him too much of that shit.

27:00.577 --> 27:03.079
You want him to get fatter
than he already is?

27:03.164 --> 27:05.207
-[Marlene] Bill!
-Come on, what happened?

27:05.291 --> 27:06.542
[Marlene sighs]

27:06.625 --> 27:08.335
-It was that Bernie Walker kid--
-Am I asking you?

27:11.129 --> 27:12.673
What did he do?

27:13.715 --> 27:15.133
He was knocking your signs down.

27:16.510 --> 27:18.053
I told him to stop,
but he wouldn't.

27:18.970 --> 27:22.015
He said I was a loser...
just like my dad.

27:25.561 --> 27:26.562
Get your coat.

27:28.647 --> 27:30.566
Get your coat!

27:42.411 --> 27:43.454
[Bill] Hey!

27:45.038 --> 27:46.290
That him?

27:50.211 --> 27:52.338
You been knocking down my signs?

27:52.421 --> 27:54.381
Yeah, so? Election's over.

27:54.465 --> 27:57.092
Doesn't give you the right to destroy
other people's property, does it?

27:58.969 --> 28:01.179
Oh, you're not running
your mouth now, huh?

28:01.263 --> 28:03.307
My boy said
you had plenty to say to him.

28:04.725 --> 28:06.435
I put myself out there.

28:07.436 --> 28:10.856
You think it's my fault they don't see it,
what I could bring?

28:12.107 --> 28:13.984
You wanna call me a loser
to my face, you little shit?

28:14.067 --> 28:15.819
I didn't call you a loser, man.

28:15.902 --> 28:17.738
Oh, my boy's a liar now, huh?

28:17.821 --> 28:19.155
He say it, or not?

28:19.240 --> 28:21.658
-Speak up when I'm talking to you.
-He said it.

28:21.742 --> 28:24.495
No, I didn't. My dad did.

28:24.578 --> 28:25.662
I was just repeating it.

28:28.290 --> 28:29.416
You think that's funny?

28:30.709 --> 28:32.878
Huh? What a man tries to do?

28:32.961 --> 28:36.047
-How he puts himself out there?
-Whatever, man, Jesus.

28:36.131 --> 28:38.759
Hey! Hey, I'm talking to you.

28:38.842 --> 28:39.843
[Fisk] Dad!

28:43.764 --> 28:45.098
-[bat thudding]
-Say something funny!

28:45.181 --> 28:46.975
Say something funny!
Go ahead!

28:47.058 --> 28:48.059
Dad, stop!

28:50.020 --> 28:51.980
-[Bill] Huh?
-[Bernie wincing]

28:52.063 --> 28:53.607
-Come here.
-Dad...

28:53.690 --> 28:55.609
Come here. Come here.

28:57.528 --> 28:58.945
Come here.

29:00.030 --> 29:02.741
It's people like this
that wanna keep you down.

29:02.824 --> 29:04.826
Keep you afraid.

29:04.910 --> 29:07.621
You have to show 'em that
that can never happen.

29:07.704 --> 29:10.416
You gotta show 'em that you're a man.

29:11.082 --> 29:12.083
Kick him.

29:12.167 --> 29:16.380
Don't give me that look like your mother.
You do what I tell you. Kick him.

29:17.298 --> 29:18.465
Kick him!

29:21.260 --> 29:22.886
-[Bernie groans]
-[Bill] Kick him again.

29:23.804 --> 29:25.264
Kick him!

29:26.181 --> 29:28.725
Keep kicking him!
Kick him!

29:28.809 --> 29:30.436
Harder!

29:30.519 --> 29:33.814
Kick him! Kick him!

29:34.815 --> 29:35.816
Harder!

29:36.942 --> 29:38.944
[breathing heavily]

29:39.027 --> 29:40.404
[gasping]

29:46.577 --> 29:48.078
[sighs]

30:25.198 --> 30:26.992
[cell phone ringing]

30:36.835 --> 30:37.836
Yes?

30:37.919 --> 30:42.007
Gao reached out.
She'd like a word.

30:42.090 --> 30:44.551
-Send the car around.
-She's coming to you.

30:44.635 --> 30:46.219
Now.

30:49.473 --> 30:51.933
Can you be here before she arrives?

30:52.017 --> 30:54.353
I'm already on my way.

30:54.436 --> 30:56.312
Thank you, Wesley.

31:01.026 --> 31:03.487
[speaking Mandarin]

31:08.825 --> 31:11.495
[speaking English]
She approves of your choice of tea.

31:12.871 --> 31:16.542
I picked it up on my last visit
to your country.

31:18.293 --> 31:20.336
I thought you might enjoy it.

31:20.421 --> 31:22.172
[speaking Mandarin]

31:28.512 --> 31:30.722
[translating in English]
She says she didn't come for tea.

31:30.806 --> 31:33.559
He does not need you
to form my words.

31:33.642 --> 31:34.935
Do you, Wilson?

31:36.478 --> 31:37.771
You speak English.

31:37.854 --> 31:40.273
I speak many languages.

31:42.901 --> 31:44.069
[Fisk] How many?

31:44.986 --> 31:46.196
All of them.

31:49.408 --> 31:53.412
[speaking Mandarin]
And you speak my tongue,

31:53.495 --> 31:54.496
do you not?

31:56.081 --> 31:58.291
How long have you known?

31:59.125 --> 32:01.044
[Gao] Since the beginning.

32:01.127 --> 32:05.131
It is the clever man who plays the fool.

32:05.215 --> 32:07.258
And a foolish woman...

32:07.342 --> 32:08.343
who does not recognize it.

32:12.180 --> 32:13.974
[speaking Japanese]
Tell me,

32:14.057 --> 32:19.896
has Nobu guessed
you speak Japanese as well?

32:19.980 --> 32:22.608
I don't believe so, no.

32:22.691 --> 32:23.817
[Gao laughs]

32:25.444 --> 32:27.320
[speaking English]
You may leave us.

32:33.159 --> 32:34.244
Wait outside.

32:43.462 --> 32:46.422
[speaking Mandarin]
Nobu isn't very happy with you.

32:46.507 --> 32:51.595
That man is never happy with anyone.

32:51.678 --> 32:53.555
[laughs] True.

32:54.640 --> 32:56.475
But...

32:56.558 --> 32:58.434
I have heard Leland...

32:58.519 --> 33:00.604
is equally displeased.

33:00.687 --> 33:04.274
It's under control.

33:05.567 --> 33:07.110
How do you think...

33:07.193 --> 33:09.530
I knew where you live, Wilson?

33:11.990 --> 33:14.618
This is one of your most guarded secrets,

33:14.701 --> 33:16.703
yes?

33:16.787 --> 33:19.540
The king in his castle.

33:20.874 --> 33:25.629
Did I divine the location
from bones and spells,

33:25.712 --> 33:30.175
chanted beneath the moonlight?

33:31.384 --> 33:32.385
No.

33:33.804 --> 33:37.641
I discovered it because...

33:37.724 --> 33:40.268
you have become sloppy.

33:41.269 --> 33:42.521
[clicking tongue]

33:42.604 --> 33:44.355
And emotional.

33:46.066 --> 33:49.695
Just as the Russians became,

33:49.778 --> 33:51.321
in their final moments.

33:57.953 --> 34:03.124
Recent events have been trying,

34:03.208 --> 34:04.793
I admit.

34:04.876 --> 34:06.753
But I promise--

34:08.254 --> 34:12.843
I am not here
to pluck flowers from a thicket.

34:13.719 --> 34:16.012
This is a courtesy,

34:16.096 --> 34:18.599
because you have shown me respect.

34:25.271 --> 34:28.316
Restore your house to order.

34:31.069 --> 34:33.321
Or I will begin dealing...

34:33.404 --> 34:35.949
with Nobu and Leland directly.

34:40.954 --> 34:43.164
Gratitude for the tea.

34:51.214 --> 34:52.340
[exclaims]

34:53.383 --> 34:55.343
[yelling]

34:57.846 --> 34:59.264
[breathing heavily]

35:03.101 --> 35:04.435
Get out.

35:06.813 --> 35:08.564
Sir, if there's anything I can bring--

35:08.649 --> 35:11.109
[yelling] Get out!

35:15.280 --> 35:16.782
[sighs heavily]

35:22.621 --> 35:24.414
Think of the man you wanna be.

35:25.540 --> 35:27.583
You sit here and you stare at that wall

35:27.668 --> 35:30.671
and you think about that.

35:30.754 --> 35:32.047
You're my son.

35:32.130 --> 35:35.634
You should be a king,
not some fat little pussy.

35:37.678 --> 35:38.804
Sit.

35:41.932 --> 35:44.059
What'd I say?
Don't look at me, look at the wall.

35:46.394 --> 35:49.064
Don't take your eyes off till I get back.

35:51.024 --> 35:52.192
[Marlene] It's late, where are you going?

35:52.275 --> 35:54.069
I gotta take care of something,
what's it matter?

35:54.152 --> 35:55.737
Can't it wait till tomorrow?

35:55.821 --> 35:58.614
No, Marlene, it can't, all right?

36:00.616 --> 36:03.954
[sighs] I gotta talk to Rigoletto...
tonight.

36:05.371 --> 36:07.248
-Oh, Jesus.
-[Bill] Don't worry.

36:07.332 --> 36:09.417
[Marlene] How much you owe him?
[Bill] Don't worry about it.

36:09.500 --> 36:11.544
-How much?
-I got it covered.

36:11.627 --> 36:12.628
That's all you need to know.

36:13.504 --> 36:15.966
You know, I told you, you shouldn't
have borrowed money from him.

36:16.049 --> 36:18.259
But no, you had to be the big shot, huh?

36:18.343 --> 36:21.304
-You had to have your face plastered all--
-[Marlene groaning]

36:21.387 --> 36:23.974
It's not enough I get that shit out there?

36:24.057 --> 36:27.477
I gotta get it in my own house?
In my own house?

36:27.560 --> 36:30.563
-[Marlene] Bill! No, no, no, no, no!
-Shut up! Shut up!

36:30.646 --> 36:32.398
-Shut up!
-[sobbing] No, please!

36:32.482 --> 36:35.068
-Shut up! Shut up!
-No, please! No!

36:36.236 --> 36:37.696
Shut up!

36:51.626 --> 36:54.129
I didn't call for you.

36:54.212 --> 36:57.007
No, I just thought
you might need something.

36:57.090 --> 36:59.425
If I needed you,
I would've asked.

37:01.302 --> 37:03.638
I don't think that's always true, sir.

37:23.867 --> 37:27.578
We'll be all right. Thank you.

37:35.378 --> 37:36.671
I like your place.

37:37.422 --> 37:39.841
Not sure about the table.

37:39.925 --> 37:41.717
-Looks like you aren't, either.
-[inhales] Please go.

37:43.594 --> 37:45.555
If that's what you really want.

37:51.227 --> 37:55.315
He's worried about you...
your friend.

37:55.398 --> 37:56.983
Ah, he shouldn't be.

37:58.693 --> 38:00.486
You made a promise...

38:01.404 --> 38:04.157
to always be honest with me.

38:05.075 --> 38:06.659
What is it?

38:11.706 --> 38:13.166
I'm afraid.

38:13.249 --> 38:15.043
Of what?

38:16.211 --> 38:18.213
The way you'd look at me if you knew.

38:30.600 --> 38:32.310
Tell me.

38:34.562 --> 38:36.439
[Bill] Shut up!
[Marlene sobbing] No, please!

38:36.522 --> 38:38.399
[Bill hitting Marlene]
Shut up! I don't wanna hear it!

38:38.483 --> 38:39.901
-[Bill] I lost because of you!
-No!

38:39.985 --> 38:41.611
-Because of this family.
-No!

38:41.694 --> 38:43.196
[Bill] They see it!

38:43.279 --> 38:45.949
They see you and that little bastard
and they laugh!

38:46.032 --> 38:47.575
[Marlene sobbing]

38:47.658 --> 38:49.160
-[Bill] And you don't believe in me!
-I do.

38:49.244 --> 38:51.621
-And you see what happens?
-No!

38:51.704 --> 38:53.498
-You see what happens?
-No!

38:53.581 --> 38:56.376
-[hitting continues]
-[Marlene wailing] Oh, God, no!

38:58.669 --> 39:00.922
-[Bill] You don't believe in me! Shut up!
-[hitting continues]

39:01.006 --> 39:02.048
Stop it!

39:03.842 --> 39:05.510
[breathing heavily]

39:07.720 --> 39:10.265
What are you gonna do with that, fatty?
Huh?

39:11.224 --> 39:12.475
Huh?

39:14.560 --> 39:16.396
That's what I thought.

39:17.688 --> 39:20.108
You believe this kid?
He gets that shit from you.

39:29.450 --> 39:31.244
Oh, God.

39:35.581 --> 39:37.667
[Fisk grunting]

39:38.709 --> 39:41.462
[yelling] Keep kicking him!
Keep kicking him!

39:42.380 --> 39:44.799
Keep kicking him!

39:46.467 --> 39:49.012
[screaming]
Keep kicking him!

39:49.930 --> 39:52.140
-Wilson... [shushing]
-[Fisk sobbing]

39:53.141 --> 39:55.060
-It's okay.
-Mommy.

39:55.143 --> 39:57.979
It's all right. It's all right, baby.
It's all right. [shushing]

39:58.063 --> 40:02.150
It's all right. It's okay. It's okay.
It's okay. It's okay, baby.

40:02.233 --> 40:04.610
-It's okay.
-[Fisk whimpering]

40:08.114 --> 40:10.075
Okay.

40:11.867 --> 40:13.494
[both breathing heavily]

40:15.413 --> 40:16.539
Get the saw.

40:57.038 --> 40:58.289
-[grunting]
-[sawing]

41:07.966 --> 41:09.175
[Fisk exhales]

41:09.259 --> 41:13.804
We carried him in bags
down to the river.

41:13.888 --> 41:17.308
One every night,
for the next week.

41:17.392 --> 41:19.144
[Vanessa shudders]

41:19.227 --> 41:21.729
Everyone in town knew
that he owed money to Rigoletto.

41:21.812 --> 41:24.274
So, I guess they thought that...

41:24.357 --> 41:26.526
he'd left town to avoid him.

41:28.361 --> 41:31.489
My mother,
she sent me to live with relatives

41:31.572 --> 41:33.491
on the farm that I told you about.

41:35.368 --> 41:36.827
It wasn't your fault.

41:38.788 --> 41:40.831
You were protecting your mother.

41:42.167 --> 41:45.378
I didn't do it for her.
I did it for me.

41:47.380 --> 41:49.632
[inhales sharply]
That's why I still wear these.

41:49.715 --> 41:53.219
To remind myself that I'm not cruel
for the sake of cruelty!

41:53.303 --> 41:55.096
That I'm not my father!

41:55.180 --> 41:57.390
That I'm not a monster!

41:59.642 --> 42:00.726
Am I?

42:02.603 --> 42:04.814
No, Wilson.

42:05.856 --> 42:07.233
You aren't.

42:12.155 --> 42:13.448
[Fisk sighs]

42:18.661 --> 42:21.497
But soon it won't matter.

42:21.581 --> 42:24.667
There are people out there
that want to expose me.

42:27.670 --> 42:30.090
They don't understand
what I'm trying to do for this city.

42:30.173 --> 42:33.551
They want to drag my name
through the streets!

42:33.634 --> 42:36.596
They want to destroy everything
that I'm trying to accomplish.

42:36.679 --> 42:38.848
[Fisk sighing heavily]

42:40.558 --> 42:42.727
And are you going to let them?

42:47.815 --> 42:49.067
No.

42:52.195 --> 42:53.196
[thunder rumbling]

42:54.239 --> 42:56.991
It was a total bust. No, I--

42:57.075 --> 43:01.079
Ellison. Ellison, no--

43:01.162 --> 43:03.998
He's a crazy old man in a tinfoil hat.

43:05.750 --> 43:09.504
And why are we chasing
a story like this anyway?

43:09.587 --> 43:11.005
What?

43:12.382 --> 43:13.841
Shit.

43:13.924 --> 43:16.552
Look, can I call you back?
I'm drowning out here.

43:16.636 --> 43:18.513
Yes, yes, okay. Fine.

43:21.432 --> 43:23.476
[thunder rumbling]

43:29.565 --> 43:31.984
We need to talk.

43:35.988 --> 43:37.615
Do you know who I am?

43:43.788 --> 43:45.080
The Devil of Hell's Kitchen.

43:45.165 --> 43:46.832
Do you believe that?

43:47.750 --> 43:49.377
What they're saying about me?

43:49.460 --> 43:52.713
You've been in an awful lot of
wrong places at the wrong time lately.

43:52.797 --> 43:54.924
But I've heard the other stories.

43:55.007 --> 43:58.178
About the man in the mask,
helping people.

43:59.595 --> 44:01.722
Sounds like maybe
there's more than one side to you.

44:02.640 --> 44:05.518
I didn't blow
the hell out of the Russians.

44:05.601 --> 44:07.395
And I didn't shoot those cops.

44:07.478 --> 44:09.355
[Ben] So, what?

44:09.439 --> 44:11.065
You want me to write your side of this?

44:11.149 --> 44:14.652
No, I want you to expose
the man responsible.

44:14.735 --> 44:18.364
The man who's tearing this city apart,
piece by piece.

44:18.448 --> 44:20.491
You got a name?

44:20.575 --> 44:21.659
Wilson Fisk.

44:22.702 --> 44:25.120
-Never heard of him.
-Because he doesn't want you to.

44:25.205 --> 44:26.289
That's what makes him dangerous.

44:26.372 --> 44:27.957
Living in the shadows,
no one knowing who he is.

44:29.459 --> 44:30.876
Said the man in the mask.

44:32.920 --> 44:36.048
-I'm trying to protect this city.
-Maybe.

44:36.131 --> 44:39.969
But right now they hate you.
And have no idea who this Fisk guy is.

44:40.052 --> 44:41.929
You can change that.

44:42.012 --> 44:43.723
So could 100 other reporters.

44:43.806 --> 44:45.225
Why me?

44:45.308 --> 44:47.643
There are good people
who trust you, Ben.

44:48.686 --> 44:50.062
I have faith in their judgment.

44:52.106 --> 44:53.941
Union Allied.

44:56.193 --> 45:00.155
Guessing that was you who dumped that guy
on the doorsteps of the Bulletin?

45:00.240 --> 45:02.199
I think he's connected to Fisk.

45:02.283 --> 45:03.743
That woman you saved that night?

45:03.826 --> 45:05.536
She's a good kid.

45:07.037 --> 45:10.750
Still believes you're a hero,
despite what everybody's saying.

45:10.833 --> 45:12.293
People like her are why I do this.

45:14.169 --> 45:16.297
If I do the smart thing and say no?

45:18.341 --> 45:20.050
Then I'll have to stop him some other way.

45:20.843 --> 45:22.219
That has a ring of finality to it.

45:22.303 --> 45:23.638
I'm not a killer.

45:24.680 --> 45:26.181
I keep telling people that.

45:26.266 --> 45:28.601
[Ben] But that could change, couldn't it?

45:32.104 --> 45:34.106
[thunder rumbles]

45:37.527 --> 45:38.528
What do you got?

45:38.611 --> 45:40.405
Bits and pieces.

45:40.488 --> 45:42.365
Russians... Triads... Yakuza...

45:42.448 --> 45:45.200
all funneling money through
a man named Leland Owlsley.

45:45.285 --> 45:48.329
The Wall Street guy?
How'd you get all this?

45:49.580 --> 45:50.665
How do you think?

45:52.333 --> 45:54.043
So all you got is
what you've beaten out of people?

45:54.960 --> 45:57.254
-I can't print that without credible--
-Detective Blake...

45:57.338 --> 45:59.340
I was at the hospital when he died.

45:59.424 --> 46:01.926
Yeah, they're saying
you sent him on his way.

46:03.260 --> 46:06.889
It was his partner, Hoffman.
They both worked for Fisk.

46:06.972 --> 46:09.934
Blake gave Fisk up, before he went.

46:10.017 --> 46:11.352
You get this on tape?

46:12.269 --> 46:15.856
Somebody else in the room
to corroborate what he said?

46:19.109 --> 46:20.861
I need reliable sources.

46:20.945 --> 46:24.031
A bunch of "he said, she said"
is not gonna put this guy away.

46:24.114 --> 46:27.452
We don't need to put him away.
Just drag him into the light.

46:27.535 --> 46:28.619
Give him nowhere to hide.

46:28.703 --> 46:31.080
Once the city knows who he is...

46:31.163 --> 46:32.873
they'll tear him apart.

46:36.168 --> 46:39.714
And this is the guy at the top.
You sure about that?

46:39.797 --> 46:41.674
I'd bet my life on it.

46:43.050 --> 46:45.470
You're betting mine now, too.

46:49.432 --> 46:51.892
-Tell me everything you know.
-[thunder rumbling]

46:54.354 --> 46:56.063
[breathing heavily]

46:59.484 --> 47:00.693
[gasps]

47:26.010 --> 47:27.512
[Ben] "'You get what you deserve.'

47:28.471 --> 47:29.722
It's an old saying.

47:29.805 --> 47:32.433
One that survived the years,
because it's true.

47:32.517 --> 47:33.559
For the most part.

47:33.643 --> 47:35.936
But not for everyone.

47:36.020 --> 47:38.856
Some get more than they deserve.

47:38.939 --> 47:42.276
Because they believe
they aren't like everyone else.

47:42.359 --> 47:45.571
That the rules,
the ones people like me and you,

47:45.655 --> 47:50.367
the people that work and struggle
to live our lives, just live,

47:50.451 --> 47:51.952
don't apply to them.

47:52.036 --> 47:55.831
That they can do anything
and live happily ever after,

47:55.915 --> 47:57.875
while the rest of us suffer.

47:58.959 --> 48:00.961
They do this from the shadows.

48:01.045 --> 48:03.172
Shadows that we cast.

48:03.255 --> 48:05.675
With our indifference.

48:05.758 --> 48:08.093
With a pervasive lack
of interest in anything

48:08.177 --> 48:12.347
that doesn't directly affect us,
we, in the here and now.

48:14.725 --> 48:17.520
Or maybe it's just
the shadow of weariness.

48:17.603 --> 48:19.980
Of how tired we are,

48:20.064 --> 48:24.902
struggling to claw our way back
to a middle class that no longer exist,

48:24.985 --> 48:27.947
because of those who take
more than they deserve.

48:28.030 --> 48:29.865
And they keep taking,

48:29.949 --> 48:32.785
until all that's left for the rest of us

48:32.868 --> 48:35.788
is a memory of how it used to be

48:35.871 --> 48:38.541
before the corporations
and the bottom line decided

48:38.624 --> 48:40.084
we didn't matter anymore.

48:41.418 --> 48:42.462
But we do.

48:43.378 --> 48:47.550
You and I,
the people of this city...

48:47.633 --> 48:50.094
we still matter.

48:51.471 --> 48:54.974
There's someone in Hell's Kitchen
that doesn't share this belief.

48:55.057 --> 48:57.977
He's been among us
for quite some time.

48:58.060 --> 49:01.438
You've never heard his name.
You've never seen his face.

49:01.522 --> 49:02.982
He's stayed in the shadows.

49:03.065 --> 49:08.488
Because men like him, men that want
to control our city, our lives,

49:08.571 --> 49:11.448
fear the light and what it reveals.

49:11.532 --> 49:16.245
This man must no longer
be allowed to operate in the darkness.

49:16.328 --> 49:20.916
If he has nothing to hide,
let him step forward."

49:22.585 --> 49:25.254
[Fisk on TV] I'm not very good at this,
out, being in public.

49:26.839 --> 49:29.424
But I felt the need
to speak up for this city

49:29.509 --> 49:32.094
that I love with all my heart.

49:33.012 --> 49:35.264
No one should have to live in fear.

49:35.347 --> 49:37.182
[crowd applauding]

49:37.975 --> 49:40.728
[Fisk] In fear of madmen...

49:40.811 --> 49:43.313
who have no regard for who they injure.

49:43.397 --> 49:46.233
In fear of the Devil of Hell's Kitchen,

49:46.316 --> 49:49.153
who has inflicted
untold pain and suffering.

49:50.070 --> 49:54.491
This masked terrorist
and psychopaths of his kind,

49:54.575 --> 49:56.285
we must show them

49:56.368 --> 50:03.208
we will not bow down to their campaign
of coercion and intimidation.

50:04.209 --> 50:06.921
We must stand up to them.

50:07.004 --> 50:10.716
As this man, my dearest friend,
Leland Owlsley,

50:10.800 --> 50:12.843
a pillar in the financial community,

50:12.927 --> 50:15.805
stood up when he was recently assaulted.

50:15.888 --> 50:19.767
But this assault was for no other reason
than to send me a message.

50:19.850 --> 50:22.687
A message warning me to stop.

50:22.770 --> 50:25.731
To give up my dream
that I have for this city.

50:25.815 --> 50:28.233
A dream of a better place.

50:29.401 --> 50:33.238
A place for its citizens to feel safe.

50:33.322 --> 50:35.783
To feel pride.

50:35.866 --> 50:38.035
I tried to do this quietly,

50:38.118 --> 50:40.079
not wanting to draw attention.

50:40.162 --> 50:41.747
The last thing I wanted

50:41.831 --> 50:44.124
was for anyone close to me

50:44.208 --> 50:47.502
to become a target
from those who do not share my dream.

50:47.587 --> 50:52.633
For those who will have
this city stay exactly as it is,

50:52.717 --> 50:55.678
mired in poverty and crime.

50:55.761 --> 50:59.098
But I know now it was foolish
to make that decision.

50:59.181 --> 51:02.017
That I can no longer do it alone.

51:02.101 --> 51:05.437
That I cannot keep
living in the shadows...

51:06.521 --> 51:08.482
afraid of the light.

51:08.565 --> 51:12.277
None of us can.
None of us should be forced to.

51:13.237 --> 51:15.698
We must do this together.

51:16.699 --> 51:20.703
We must resist
those who would have us live in fear.

51:25.332 --> 51:26.834
My name...

51:28.543 --> 51:30.420
is Wilson Fisk.

51:30.504 --> 51:35.384
And together,
we can make this city a better place.

51:35.467 --> 51:36.468
