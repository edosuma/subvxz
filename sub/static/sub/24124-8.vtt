WEBVTT

00:00.291 --> 00:03.375
I gotta get goin'

00:03.375 --> 00:06.833
a friend of mine

00:08.500 --> 00:11.458
he's just Pooh Bear

00:14.125 --> 00:17.583
chasin' some honeybees

00:17.583 --> 00:21.000
I know he's out there

00:24.458 --> 00:27.875
we're so adventurous

00:27.875 --> 00:31.333
and again

00:31.333 --> 00:34.833
and there's nobody home

00:34.833 --> 00:38.250
to count on a friend

00:38.250 --> 00:41.708
Winnie the Pooh Bear

00:43.708 --> 00:45.250
take me, please?

00:45.250 --> 00:48.708
I gotta be there

00:50.583 --> 00:55.208
Winnie the Pooh

01:10.125 --> 01:11.416
Ooh.

01:11.416 --> 01:12.750
Ooh, hey,
there's a good one.

01:15.458 --> 01:16.708
Rabbit: Ready?

01:16.708 --> 01:18.500
Now!

01:18.500 --> 01:21.375
Hey, hey.
Un-handle me, you guys.

01:21.375 --> 01:25.875
One... two... three.

01:28.166 --> 01:32.166
No, this bouncin' Tigger's
not touchin' those bubbles.

01:32.166 --> 01:36.125
If you're going to
bounce in mud puddles,

01:36.125 --> 01:38.750
you're going to take baths.

01:44.083 --> 01:45.708
Ooh. No, wait a minute.

01:45.708 --> 01:48.416
No, no, no, no.
Ooh.

01:52.958 --> 01:55.291
There.

01:55.291 --> 01:56.291
Done.

02:01.458 --> 02:02.875
What's the matter?

02:02.875 --> 02:05.125
Too clean for you?

02:05.125 --> 02:07.625
Oh, no, very clean indeed.

02:07.625 --> 02:09.333
But, uh--

02:09.333 --> 02:10.750
Who are you?

02:10.750 --> 02:14.375
Tigger.
Who else would I be,
for goodness sake?

02:14.375 --> 02:18.000
But you-- Why,
you couldn't possibly
be Tigger.

02:18.000 --> 02:20.333
Tiggers have stripes.

02:22.333 --> 02:24.583
My stripes!

02:24.583 --> 02:26.125
Where did they go?

02:28.708 --> 02:31.625
Tigger,
are you hiding in here?

02:31.625 --> 02:33.625
Oh. Hello.

02:33.625 --> 02:36.458
I'm Pooh Bear.
Have we met?

02:36.458 --> 02:38.833
Buddy bear,
it's me.

02:38.833 --> 02:40.833
Of course it is.

02:40.833 --> 02:43.166
Uh, but me who?

02:43.166 --> 02:45.000
Hmm. Good question.

02:45.000 --> 02:46.833
Tigger.

02:46.833 --> 02:48.708
Oh, Tigger.

02:48.708 --> 02:51.083
Hmm. He must have
gone home.

02:51.833 --> 02:53.875
I'm not Tigger?

02:53.875 --> 02:56.208
Hm. I wonder who I am.

02:56.208 --> 03:00.500
Well, you do have
two ears and a tail.

03:00.500 --> 03:03.083
Perhaps, you're--
you're a rabbit?

03:05.500 --> 03:07.291
Hey, yeah.

03:07.291 --> 03:09.250
He doesn't have stripes
either.

03:09.250 --> 03:11.375
Maybe I am a rabbit.

03:11.375 --> 03:13.833
Oh, I'm glad
that's settled.

03:13.833 --> 03:15.166
Wait a minute.

03:15.166 --> 03:16.500
I don't know how
to be a rabbit.

03:16.500 --> 03:18.416
What do I do?

03:18.416 --> 03:23.208
Rabbit, you've been a rabbit
longer than anyone I know of.

03:23.208 --> 03:24.833
Could you teach him?

03:24.833 --> 03:26.708
Yeah, Rabbit.

03:26.708 --> 03:28.625
Will you teach me
everything you know
about rabbiting?

03:28.625 --> 03:30.208
Would you please,
huh, please?

03:30.208 --> 03:32.000
Oh.

03:32.000 --> 03:34.750
Well... I guess.

03:34.750 --> 03:36.500
If I have to.

03:38.000 --> 03:40.750
The most important thing
to a rabbit

03:40.750 --> 03:42.458
is his garden.

03:42.458 --> 03:44.125
Right, fellow bunny.

03:45.583 --> 03:49.291
Here. Your first lesson
in being a rabbit

03:49.291 --> 03:53.958
is to protect my
prize winning tomatoes.

03:53.958 --> 03:57.208
Don't let any insects
near them.

03:57.208 --> 03:59.291
Why, I'll guard
your tomatey-os

03:59.291 --> 04:01.583
as if they were
my very own "vegebables,"

04:01.583 --> 04:03.416
fellow rabbit.

04:03.416 --> 04:05.583
Hmm. See that you do.

04:05.583 --> 04:10.000
Hut, two, three, furr.
Hut, two, three, furr.

04:10.000 --> 04:13.750
Hut, two, three, furr.
Hut, two, three, furr.

04:15.291 --> 04:16.333
Halt.

04:16.333 --> 04:18.458
Who crawls there?

04:26.250 --> 04:28.583
Oh, you're hungry,
huh, buggy boy?

04:31.458 --> 04:35.458
Well, I guess
one tomatey-o won't hurt.

04:35.458 --> 04:38.958
Uh, just don't tell
the other rabbit, okay?

04:48.625 --> 04:51.125
Oh, no!
You didn't!

04:51.125 --> 04:52.833
You did!

04:52.833 --> 04:54.583
Oh, fellow rabbit,

04:54.583 --> 04:58.000
it's just one hungry,
defenseless little bug.

04:58.000 --> 05:00.458
But you don't understand.

05:00.458 --> 05:03.375
He'll tell his friends
where there's food,

05:03.375 --> 05:05.583
- and--
-

05:05.583 --> 05:07.333
Oh, no!

05:07.333 --> 05:09.875
My prize winning tomatoes.

05:11.875 --> 05:14.875
My b-beautiful garden.

05:14.875 --> 05:16.166
Gone!

05:16.166 --> 05:17.291
Get out!

05:17.291 --> 05:21.458
Get out of here,
you-- you pest!

05:26.000 --> 05:29.875
Guess I'm not
a rabbit after all.

05:36.458 --> 05:39.291
Say, I wonder if
I'm a bear?

05:41.333 --> 05:43.958
I can't see a thing
under this hat.

05:43.958 --> 05:45.125
Don't worry.

05:45.125 --> 05:48.000
That helps to
confuse the bees.

05:55.458 --> 05:57.583
Oh, hello.

05:57.583 --> 06:01.500
Wasn't expecting anyone
to bump into me today.

06:01.500 --> 06:03.208
Oh, sorry, Eeyore.

06:03.208 --> 06:05.500
I got no "visinability"
as a bear.

06:05.500 --> 06:08.500
Perfectly understandable,
Tigger.

06:10.375 --> 06:14.000
Pooh, Eeyore
just called me a tigger.

06:14.000 --> 06:17.416
But you're a bear.
Remember?

06:17.416 --> 06:18.583
Oh, yes, yes.

06:19.708 --> 06:22.208
Now this is a honey tree.

06:22.208 --> 06:24.375
- See?

06:27.416 --> 06:30.083
And a hard one, too.

06:30.083 --> 06:31.583
- Yow!

06:33.458 --> 06:37.708
Ooh. Not afraid to
come out in the open
and fight me, huh?

06:45.708 --> 06:47.583
I don't think
I want to be a bear.

06:47.583 --> 06:49.250
It gives me
a heady-ache.

06:49.250 --> 06:50.416
Don't worry.

06:50.416 --> 06:52.083
We'll find out
what you are.

06:56.750 --> 06:59.500
Ooh, I look like
a Christmas tree.

06:59.500 --> 07:03.750
Y-yes, well,
I-- I'm afraid you're
too big to be a piglet.

07:03.750 --> 07:07.583
We can't all be
very small animals.

07:07.583 --> 07:10.583
Oh, I just love
the holidays.

07:11.416 --> 07:14.458
A yuletide celebration.

07:14.458 --> 07:17.333
A Tigger tree and everything.

07:17.333 --> 07:19.458
How festive.

07:19.458 --> 07:22.750
Obviously, I wasn't invited.

07:22.750 --> 07:24.708
This is "ridickerous."

07:24.708 --> 07:27.083
I don't want to be
a Scotch pine.

07:27.083 --> 07:29.750
Oh, I do wish
Tigger were here.

07:29.750 --> 07:31.583
Perhaps he could
think of something.

07:32.458 --> 07:35.083
Hey. Maybe I am a Tigger.

07:35.083 --> 07:39.083
No. I'm afraid he's
the only one.

07:39.083 --> 07:41.291
And he has stripes.

07:41.291 --> 07:44.625
Oh, uh, couldn't we
paint stripes on him?

07:49.125 --> 07:50.833
No, no.

07:50.833 --> 07:52.458
Oh, stop.

07:52.458 --> 07:55.291
Stop it, I--

07:55.291 --> 07:58.416
Mm. Sort of stunning,
wouldn't you say?

07:58.416 --> 08:02.000
You know, I think
you could be a Tigger.

08:02.000 --> 08:04.875
Uh, you think
I could be a Tigger?

08:04.875 --> 08:06.166
I'm a Tigger.

08:06.166 --> 08:07.458
I'm a Tigger!

08:07.458 --> 08:10.000
I'm a Tigger!

08:13.458 --> 08:15.750
I'm not a Tigger.

08:43.500 --> 08:45.333
I'm not a tigger.

08:45.333 --> 08:47.458
I'm not a rabbit.

08:47.458 --> 08:49.375
I'm not a bear.

08:49.375 --> 08:52.708
Huh. And I'm sure not
a piglet.

08:52.708 --> 08:55.000
I'm not an anything.

08:56.875 --> 08:59.250
What is a guy...

08:59.250 --> 09:01.833
when he's a nothin'?

09:01.833 --> 09:04.416
Nothin' but stuffin'.

09:04.416 --> 09:07.708
Ain't even got a name.

09:29.000 --> 09:32.750
Somehow...

09:32.750 --> 09:34.750
I don't have a name.

09:45.500 --> 09:46.958
Hello, Tigger.

09:46.958 --> 09:49.708
You know, that's
the third time today

09:49.708 --> 09:51.500
you've called me Tigger.

09:51.500 --> 09:53.333
Well, aren't ya?

09:53.333 --> 09:56.250
No. I don't have
any stripes.

09:56.250 --> 09:58.375
Ah, doesn't matter.

09:58.375 --> 10:00.125
You're still Tigger.

10:00.125 --> 10:01.708
On the inside.

10:01.708 --> 10:04.416
I didn't know eeyores
had x-ray vision.

10:04.416 --> 10:06.958
Nah, don't need it.

10:06.958 --> 10:09.458
You'll always be Tigger.

10:09.458 --> 10:11.833
It's all in the stuffing.

10:11.833 --> 10:15.583
You mean, I'm a Tigger
no matter what?

10:15.583 --> 10:18.583
Well, of course.

10:18.583 --> 10:21.625
Ya-hoo!

10:21.625 --> 10:24.833
Nothin' to get
hysterical about.

10:31.083 --> 10:32.583
Well, what do ya know?

10:32.583 --> 10:35.291
A stripe.

10:35.291 --> 10:37.416
My stripe!
I got a stripe!

10:40.833 --> 10:44.708
Uh, Pooh,
do you hear that?

10:44.708 --> 10:45.750
Ooh.

10:45.750 --> 10:47.583
Hiya, buddy bear.

10:47.583 --> 10:49.291
Oh.

10:49.291 --> 10:51.000
Hello, Tigger.

10:51.000 --> 10:53.333
He called me Tigger.

10:54.625 --> 10:58.166
Well, Pooh boy,
I got my stripes back.

10:58.166 --> 11:02.000
Uh, all except for one.

11:08.500 --> 11:09.833
Thanks, buddy boy.

11:09.833 --> 11:11.875
Now I'm a Tigger
on the outside,

11:11.875 --> 11:13.833
and a Tigger
on the inside, too.

11:13.833 --> 11:16.875
Well, I got a lot of
bouncing to catch up on.

11:16.875 --> 11:18.583
Goodbye, Tigger.

11:21.875 --> 11:24.625
Hey, wait a minute.

11:26.875 --> 11:29.458
Ahh.
That's more like a Tigger.

11:31.000 --> 11:32.208
TTFN.

11:32.208 --> 11:33.333
Ta-ta for now.

11:45.583 --> 11:48.250
Pooh. Piglet.

11:48.250 --> 11:50.708
Where are you?

11:50.708 --> 11:53.875
It's Christopher Robin.

11:56.208 --> 11:57.250
Piglet: Look.

11:57.250 --> 11:59.083
Aww.

11:59.083 --> 12:01.875
I guess they don't want to
come to the birthday party.

12:03.708 --> 12:06.125
All: It's his birthday.

12:06.125 --> 12:08.583
We didn't get him
any presents.

12:10.208 --> 12:12.708
There's only
one thing to do.

12:12.708 --> 12:14.208
Quick. This way.

12:15.708 --> 12:18.250
Pooh:
Shouldn't we have gotten
Christopher Robin

12:18.250 --> 12:21.083
some real presents?

12:21.083 --> 12:23.708
Tigger: Hey, we're real,
ain't we?

12:23.708 --> 12:26.250
Besides,
we're the best presents
a kid could get.

12:29.291 --> 12:34.583
Boy, this is the best present
any kid could get.

12:34.583 --> 12:36.708
Pooh Bear.

12:38.208 --> 12:40.708
Hmm. Where is everybody?

12:40.708 --> 12:43.958
Isn't it time to
yell "surprise"?

12:43.958 --> 12:45.250
'Fraid not, buddy boy.

12:45.250 --> 12:46.875
We're too late.

12:46.875 --> 12:49.625
Christopher Robin's
already got the best present

12:49.625 --> 12:52.083
that any kid could get.

12:52.083 --> 12:53.708
And--

12:53.708 --> 12:55.416
It isn't us.

12:55.416 --> 12:59.958
Well, I want to know
just what it is.

12:59.958 --> 13:02.291
Pooh:
Careful, Rabbit.

13:02.291 --> 13:04.000
That isn't ours.

13:04.000 --> 13:06.333
It belongs to
Christopher Robin.

13:10.458 --> 13:11.625
Ooh-hoo!

13:31.166 --> 13:32.458
Ta-dah.

13:32.458 --> 13:33.958
All right.

13:33.958 --> 13:35.625
Kid, you ain't seen
nothin' yet.

13:35.625 --> 13:38.291
Just my way of sayin'
a big happy birthday

13:38.291 --> 13:39.583
to little old you.

13:39.583 --> 13:41.458
So come on, kid.

13:41.458 --> 13:43.166
We're gonna have some
fun, fun, fun.

13:43.166 --> 13:45.583
Uh, kid?

13:45.583 --> 13:47.458
Hey, where'd he go?

13:47.458 --> 13:52.500
Kid. Kid.

13:52.500 --> 13:55.500
Aww. He unwounded.

14:01.000 --> 14:03.833
Hey, kid.

14:03.833 --> 14:05.875
Uh, hey, uh,
where'd he go?

14:12.750 --> 14:16.708
Hey, wha-- what kind of toys
are you guys supposed to be?

14:17.833 --> 14:19.875
Well, this is Piglet.

14:19.875 --> 14:22.250
And Tigger.
And Rabbit.

14:22.250 --> 14:24.708
And I'm Winnie the Pooh.

14:24.708 --> 14:26.375
But you can call me--

14:26.375 --> 14:30.333
It's priceless.

14:30.333 --> 14:34.250
A Pooh named Winnie?

14:34.250 --> 14:35.833
Don't look now,

14:35.833 --> 14:38.708
but I think this ape's
one banana short of a bunch.

14:38.708 --> 14:41.000
Aww, come on.

14:41.000 --> 14:43.166
You've got--
Listen, uh--

14:43.166 --> 14:47.000
C-can any of you old timers
direct me to the party?

14:47.000 --> 14:49.875
I got a kid
to make happy, huh?

14:49.875 --> 14:54.125
Well, who are you calling
old timers?

14:54.125 --> 14:56.000
For your information,

14:56.000 --> 14:58.291
the kid is a friend of ours.

14:58.291 --> 14:59.750
Christopher Robin.

14:59.750 --> 15:02.375
And just who are you?

15:02.375 --> 15:04.208
I'm Bruno,

15:04.208 --> 15:06.750
the best present
a kid could get.

15:06.750 --> 15:07.875
I walk, I talk,

15:07.875 --> 15:09.708
I dance.

15:09.708 --> 15:11.750
I'm the A-number one
top toy around.

15:11.750 --> 15:13.583
Yeah? Says who?

15:13.583 --> 15:15.958
Well, it says right here,
right on the box, see?

15:15.958 --> 15:19.958
"Hey, kids,
once you play with
a genuine Bruno--"

15:19.958 --> 15:21.583
That's me.

15:21.583 --> 15:24.125
"You'll throw those
old-fashioned toys away."

15:24.125 --> 15:25.333
And that's you.

15:25.333 --> 15:28.333
Oh. Th-th-throw us away?

15:28.333 --> 15:31.375
If anybody's getting
thrown away,

15:31.375 --> 15:32.875
it's you.

15:32.875 --> 15:36.500
Not when Christopher Robin
sees what I can do.

15:38.000 --> 15:41.250
Oh, yeah?
Well, we can do
lots of stuff, too.

15:41.250 --> 15:44.416
Yeah, sure, sure, yeah.

15:44.416 --> 15:46.125
What say we find out?

15:46.125 --> 15:49.708
Now, if I can't do
everything you can do,

15:49.708 --> 15:51.458
I'll hit the road.

15:51.458 --> 15:55.083
Course, if I can--

15:55.083 --> 15:58.625
Then you guys gotta leave.
Vamoose. Go away.

15:58.625 --> 15:59.833
Forever.

15:59.833 --> 16:02.750
F-f-f-forever?

16:02.750 --> 16:06.000
Would you want
Christopher Robin

16:06.000 --> 16:08.583
to be stuck with
a bunch of...

16:08.583 --> 16:10.708
second rate toys?

16:10.708 --> 16:12.583
Oh, d-d-d-dear.

16:12.583 --> 16:14.458
Well,
I'm a first rate bouncer.

16:14.458 --> 16:16.125
Uh, how about you?

16:16.125 --> 16:19.166
Me? Can I bounce?

16:21.708 --> 16:23.958
Not bad.
For a beginner.

16:23.958 --> 16:26.000
But how about this?

16:27.291 --> 16:29.333
This is embarrassing.

16:29.333 --> 16:32.333
Hmph. Grandstanding
if you ask me.

16:32.333 --> 16:35.000
Uh, how are you
at horticulture?

16:35.000 --> 16:36.166
Horsey what?

16:36.166 --> 16:38.625
Ha. Just as I suspected.

16:38.625 --> 16:41.625
You know nothing
about gardening.

16:41.625 --> 16:45.125
I didn't just fall off
the carrot truck.

16:45.125 --> 16:46.750
You want gardening?

16:46.750 --> 16:48.000
I'll show you gardening.

16:58.500 --> 17:00.083
Oh, my.
Oh, my!

17:00.083 --> 17:03.875
And what do you do best?

17:03.875 --> 17:06.583
Well, uh, that is, uh--

17:06.583 --> 17:08.833
Well... nothing.

17:08.833 --> 17:11.708
Oh, what a joke.

17:11.708 --> 17:13.416
Next.

17:13.416 --> 17:18.083
So, butter ball,
what do you do?

17:18.083 --> 17:21.333
Hm. Well,
I do "me" things.

17:22.000 --> 17:23.708
"You" things?

17:23.708 --> 17:26.416
No. "Who" things.

17:26.416 --> 17:29.375
Yeah, Brunos.
Like finding honey.

17:29.375 --> 17:30.750
That's right.

17:30.750 --> 17:33.458
Why, our Pooh Bear
could have that honey

17:33.458 --> 17:34.875
in no time.

17:36.958 --> 17:39.083
It's honey time.

17:40.416 --> 17:42.958
-

17:46.125 --> 17:48.208
As you can see, uh--

17:48.208 --> 17:50.583
I am the best toy.

17:50.583 --> 17:52.250
Oh, dear.

17:52.250 --> 17:54.583
Perhaps you shouldn't have
wound him up, Pooh.

18:03.875 --> 18:06.583
I'm going to miss
Christopher Robin.

18:08.750 --> 18:10.583
Can't believe that
this morning

18:10.583 --> 18:12.458
we were such good friends.

18:12.458 --> 18:13.750
Until that "gorillia"

18:13.750 --> 18:15.958
threw a monkey wrench
into things.

18:21.250 --> 18:24.833
I'll miss
Christopher Robin, too.

18:24.833 --> 18:27.625
If only I could
hear his voice once more.

18:28.833 --> 18:30.708
Christopher Robin:
Pooh Bear.

18:30.708 --> 18:35.416
Why, my honey pot sounds
just like Christopher Robin.

18:35.416 --> 18:37.250
Hey, what's going on?

18:37.250 --> 18:38.875
They're movin' on,
that's what.

18:38.875 --> 18:41.291
Hittin' the road,
adios,goin' bye-bye.

18:41.291 --> 18:43.166
You mean,
you're leaving?

18:43.166 --> 18:45.583
Bruno's the best present
anyone could get.

18:46.833 --> 18:48.458
Tigger: Yeah.
He out-bounced me.

18:49.875 --> 18:52.625
Rabbit: His garden grew
better than mine.

18:52.625 --> 18:56.333
He smackereled
an entire bee hive.

18:56.333 --> 18:57.583
Whole.

18:57.583 --> 18:59.875
Not a drop left.

18:59.875 --> 19:01.583
I checked.

19:01.583 --> 19:04.708
We want you have the best,
Christopher Robin.

19:04.708 --> 19:07.708
And since we aren't
the best--

19:07.708 --> 19:11.000
Silly old bear.

19:11.000 --> 19:13.291
I love you all
for what you are,

19:13.291 --> 19:15.291
not what you can do.

19:15.291 --> 19:17.458
Bruno's not for me.

19:17.458 --> 19:20.500
I'm not gonna keep him.

19:20.500 --> 19:22.625
What?!

19:22.625 --> 19:24.875
The best present
any kid could ever get,

19:24.875 --> 19:29.000
and I'm being...

19:29.000 --> 19:30.958
shipped out?

19:32.708 --> 19:35.166
You're not keeping him?

19:35.166 --> 19:37.416
Of course not.

19:37.416 --> 19:40.000
He's a present
for my friend,

19:40.000 --> 19:41.750
not for me.

19:41.750 --> 19:44.208
Oh, that's a hot one.

19:44.208 --> 19:46.000
You hear that, Bruno?

19:46.000 --> 19:47.208
Bruno?

19:47.208 --> 19:49.208
Hey, where'd that
big ape get to?

19:49.208 --> 19:51.375
Hm. The way he moves,

19:51.375 --> 19:54.625
that silly chimp could be
halfway to China by now.

19:57.333 --> 19:59.583
I wonder where I am.

19:59.583 --> 20:01.875
Probably halfway to China.

20:01.875 --> 20:04.333
China.

20:05.875 --> 20:08.000
Nobody'll want me there,
either.

20:13.208 --> 20:18.458
Nothin' for me to do
but just... unwind.

20:27.583 --> 20:30.000
Christopher Robin:
Bruno.

20:30.000 --> 20:33.500
Tigger:
Hey, banana breath!

20:33.500 --> 20:35.250
Hurry, let's get cranking.

20:42.708 --> 20:45.291
Whoa, whoa.

20:45.291 --> 20:47.583
Uh, I got a kink in my neck.

20:47.583 --> 20:50.125
You must have
a kink in your head

20:50.125 --> 20:51.958
runnin' off like that.

20:51.958 --> 20:54.875
Uh, what are you
doin' here?

20:54.875 --> 20:57.500
We were worried about you.

20:57.500 --> 20:59.875
Why would you worry about me?

20:59.875 --> 21:04.250
Because you are the best toy
any kid could ever get.

21:04.250 --> 21:06.750
You told us yourself.

21:06.750 --> 21:08.500
Yeah, constantly.

21:08.500 --> 21:11.583
Look, these are my friends.

21:11.583 --> 21:13.250
You'll be my friend's friend.

21:13.250 --> 21:16.250
And you'll be happy
just like we are.

21:16.250 --> 21:17.875
No kiddin'?

21:17.875 --> 21:20.291
Well, then,
what are we waitin' for?

21:25.291 --> 21:27.750
Come on, you guys,
now wrap me up pretty.

21:27.750 --> 21:30.833
I got a birthday party
to go to, huh?

21:30.833 --> 21:32.708
A birthday party?

21:32.708 --> 21:35.958
Did he say
birthday party?

21:37.583 --> 21:40.000
There. Good as new.

21:44.000 --> 21:45.333
Bye, Bruno.

21:45.333 --> 21:47.625
Good luck.

21:47.625 --> 21:49.708
Christopher Robin,

21:49.708 --> 21:54.333
do you think that perhaps
Bruno would take me along?

21:54.333 --> 21:56.000
Why, Pooh?

21:57.875 --> 22:00.000
Where there's
a birthday party,

22:00.000 --> 22:01.458
there's cake.

22:01.458 --> 22:03.458
And where there's cake,

22:03.458 --> 22:06.333
there's a rumbly
in my tumbly.

22:06.333 --> 22:08.833
Silly old bear.
