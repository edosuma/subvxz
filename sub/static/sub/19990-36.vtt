You're smart now.

21:22.847 --> 21:26.081
It's funny that Mr. Krabs never
showed up to get his diploma.

21:26.083 --> 21:28.517
- Yeah, the only two people who
didn't show up

21:28.519 --> 21:29.852
are Mr. Krabs and Plankton.

21:29.854 --> 21:33.989
[gasps]
Let me have that diploma.

21:33.991 --> 21:34.923
[panting]

21:34.925 --> 21:37.593
- Hey, no running in the halls.

21:37.595 --> 21:38.827
- Eee-eee-eee-eee.

21:38.829 --> 21:42.431
- Here you go, Plankton.

21:42.433 --> 21:45.567
- Mr. Krabs, your diploma.

21:46.169 --> 21:49.738
- Thanks to this here diploma,
I'm suddenly smart enough

21:49.740 --> 21:52.841
to never give you me secret
formula.

21:52.843 --> 21:53.509
- What?

21:53.511 --> 21:54.810
If I knew education worked like
that,

21:54.812 --> 21:56.945
I would have bought a
diploma years ago.

21:56.947 --> 22:00.516
- Of course it doesn't work like
that, you microscopic meathead.

22:00.518 --> 22:04.620
I took accelerated classes and
graduated months ago.

22:04.622 --> 22:06.789
This diploma
is just a formality.

22:06.791 --> 22:10.659
- But--but you were just about
to give me the formula.

22:10.661 --> 22:12.995
You were scared of me.

22:12.997 --> 22:15.898
- Excellent, Mr. Krabs.

22:15.900 --> 22:20.169
Here's your final grade for
acting class: A-plus.

22:20.171 --> 22:22.071
I really felt the fear.

22:22.073 --> 22:23.238
- Wait. What?

22:23.240 --> 22:25.240
Acting class?

22:25.242 --> 22:26.075
No!

22:26.077 --> 22:30.679
- You've finally been schooled,
dropout.

22:30.681 --> 22:32.815
- Oof.

22:32.817 --> 22:35.084
Ahh!

22:35.086 --> 22:37.252
<i>[laughter]</i>

22:37.254 --> 22:38.887
- Come on, evil genius.

22:38.889 --> 22:41.890
Time to start
your post-college years.

22:41.892 --> 22:44.593
