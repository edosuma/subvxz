00:01.836 --> 00:03.460
<i>- Last year,
a competition was created</i>

00:03.504 --> 00:05.629
<i>to test the nation's
best bladesmiths.</i>

00:05.673 --> 00:08.007
<i>Thousands responded,
and this year,</i>

00:08.050 --> 00:09.883
<i>craftsmen
from all over the country</i>

00:09.927 --> 00:11.802
<i>and all walks of life
have come forward</i>

00:11.846 --> 00:13.971
<i>for their chance
to claim the title.</i>

00:14.015 --> 00:15.556
- I'm gonna be the next
"Forged in Fire" champion.

00:15.599 --> 00:16.849
- I want to win!

00:16.892 --> 00:18.267
- It would be
a life-changing moment.

00:18.310 --> 00:19.977
- Welcome to the Forge.

00:20.021 --> 00:22.354
<i>Now the Forge returns
with challenges</i>

00:22.398 --> 00:24.773
<i>unlike anything
ever seen before.</i>

00:24.817 --> 00:26.650
You'll be using this.

00:26.694 --> 00:30.195
<i>Skill and ingenuity
will be pushed to the limit.</i>

00:30.239 --> 00:32.197
<i>Some will rise to the challenge.</i>

00:32.241 --> 00:34.575
<i>Some will fall,
but only the best</i>

00:34.618 --> 00:37.286
<i>will be crowned
"Forged in Fire" champions</i>

00:37.329 --> 00:39.580
<i>and take home $10,000.</i>

00:39.623 --> 00:42.583
<i>[dramatic music]</i>

00:42.626 --> 00:49.131
<i>¶ ¶</i>

00:49.175 --> 00:52.176
<i>- My name is Morgan Medland,
and I am 20 years old.</i>

00:52.219 --> 00:53.677
<i>If someone were to think</i>

00:53.721 --> 00:55.596
that I can't win
because I'm so young,

00:55.639 --> 00:57.598
all I have to say to them
is, "Just watch me."

00:57.641 --> 00:59.558
<i>- My name is Mardi Meshejian.</i>

00:59.602 --> 01:03.062
<i>I started as a jeweler,
but I just switched metals.</i>

01:03.105 --> 01:06.857
I like to push the boundaries
on what knives are.

01:06.901 --> 01:08.692
-<i> I'm Travis Wuertz.</i>

01:08.736 --> 01:10.903
I own a company
that manufactures accessories

01:10.946 --> 01:12.488
and tools for knife makers,

01:12.531 --> 01:16.075
<i>and I made my first real knife
when I was 12.</i>

01:16.118 --> 01:17.618
<i>- I'm Tom Ward.</i>

01:17.661 --> 01:19.495
<i>I am an architectural
fabricator.</i>

01:19.538 --> 01:24.249
My job entails making
fancy things for people

01:24.293 --> 01:26.168
who have more money than sense.

01:26.212 --> 01:27.711
<i>¶ ¶</i>

01:27.755 --> 01:30.714
- Bladesmiths,
welcome to the Forge.

01:30.758 --> 01:34.009
You are here to participate
in three rounds of competition

01:34.053 --> 01:35.893
designed to test every aspect

01:35.930 --> 01:38.347
of your edged weapon making
capabilities.

01:38.390 --> 01:40.140
At the end of each round,

01:40.184 --> 01:43.185
you will present your work
to our panel of expert judges.

01:43.229 --> 01:46.396
American Bladesmith Society
Master Smith, J. Neilson.

01:46.440 --> 01:50.109
Historic weapons re-creation
specialist, David Baker.

01:50.152 --> 01:53.612
Edged weapon specialist,
Doug Marcaida.

01:53.656 --> 01:56.448
They will decide which of you
is the "Forged in Fire" champion

01:56.492 --> 02:00.119
and leaves here
with a check for $10,000.

02:00.162 --> 02:03.539
All right, gents, this is
where things get exciting.

02:03.582 --> 02:06.208
In your first round
of competition,

02:06.252 --> 02:08.168
you'll be using this.

02:08.212 --> 02:11.171
<i>[tense music]</i>

02:11.215 --> 02:12.548
<i>¶ ¶</i>

02:12.591 --> 02:15.759
Your first round challenge
is to cut, saw,

02:15.803 --> 02:19.388
or disassemble from this car
all the materials you need

02:19.431 --> 02:21.140
to forge a blade
of your own design

02:21.183 --> 02:23.058
in your signature style.

02:23.102 --> 02:25.811
- [bleep], a car.

02:25.855 --> 02:28.063
[bleep].
[laughs]

02:28.107 --> 02:31.608
I do not typically
use car parts to make blades.

02:31.652 --> 02:32.985
- The blades themselves

02:33.028 --> 02:35.988
must fall within
the following parameters:

02:36.031 --> 02:38.240
<i>the length of the blade,
not including the tang,</i>

02:38.284 --> 02:41.160
<i>must be between 9 and 11 inches.</i>

02:41.203 --> 02:42.953
<i>The overall length
of your weapon</i>

02:42.997 --> 02:46.373
<i>must not exceed 22 inches.</i>

02:46.417 --> 02:48.000
Keeping up with the car theme,

02:48.043 --> 02:50.961
at the end of round two
your finished weapons

02:51.005 --> 02:52.379
will be tested and judged

02:52.423 --> 02:54.464
based on how they perform
in a tire slice

02:54.508 --> 02:57.676
<i>and their ability
to cut through jumper cables.</i>

02:57.720 --> 03:00.220
You will have four hours
to salvage your materials

03:00.264 --> 03:02.014
and forge your blades.

03:02.057 --> 03:05.267
Good luck, bladesmiths,
you'll need it.

03:05.311 --> 03:08.353
Your time starts... now.

03:08.397 --> 03:11.106
<i>[rock music]</i>

03:11.150 --> 03:13.150
Which metal
would you go for, Jay?

03:13.194 --> 03:15.319
- I'd be going
for the coil springs.

03:15.362 --> 03:16.737
- Dave?

03:16.780 --> 03:18.113
- Either the coil springs
or the axles.

03:18.157 --> 03:19.997
- Doug?
- I'd go for the tires.

03:20.034 --> 03:22.451
We use rubber knives
for training.

03:22.494 --> 03:23.619
- [laughs]

03:23.662 --> 03:25.162
So immediately these guys

03:25.206 --> 03:27.039
look like they're
on the NASCAR circuit.

03:27.082 --> 03:29.541
They're just ripping the tires
off of these vehicles.

03:29.585 --> 03:32.711
- I've never directly
pulled pieces off a car

03:32.755 --> 03:34.546
<i>for my own use.</i>

03:34.590 --> 03:38.884
The piece of metal that I go for
is the coil spring.

03:38.928 --> 03:40.677
<i>Brute force and ignorance.</i>

03:40.721 --> 03:42.888
[laughs]

03:42.932 --> 03:44.723
- Tom got that out
in record time.

03:44.767 --> 03:46.516
- He certainly did.

03:46.560 --> 03:49.228
<i>- The weapon I'm making
is a competition cutter,</i>

03:49.271 --> 03:51.980
<i>which has a big, like,
very brutal blade.</i>

03:52.024 --> 03:53.357
<i>Very robust.</i>

03:53.400 --> 03:55.275
And I'm thinking
that the challenges

03:55.319 --> 03:58.904
that they've issued us would
require a really robust blade.

03:58.948 --> 04:02.282
The plan is
to take all the pieces

04:02.326 --> 04:04.451
of spring, uncoil them,

04:04.495 --> 04:07.287
and then assemble them
into a construction

04:07.331 --> 04:09.122
that I can forge weld
into a bar.

04:09.166 --> 04:11.458
- It's not gonna be easy
to get those loose parts

04:11.502 --> 04:13.126
forged into a billet.

04:13.170 --> 04:14.920
<i>- If I don't get this billet
done properly,</i>

04:14.964 --> 04:17.756
<i>everything that I do
in the next steps</i>

04:17.800 --> 04:20.884
could possibly fail and put me
out of the competition.

04:20.928 --> 04:24.221
<i>¶ ¶</i>

04:24.265 --> 04:27.182
- All right, guys,
coming in hot on this side.

04:27.226 --> 04:29.810
<i>I've made several blades
from car parts.</i>

04:29.853 --> 04:32.145
Actually, most of the blades
I started off making

04:32.189 --> 04:36.483
were made from leaf springs
from large tractors and cars.

04:36.527 --> 04:40.612
I'm making a large
chopper-hunter mash up,

04:40.656 --> 04:42.447
is I guess
what you would call it.

04:42.491 --> 04:45.534
<i>It's got a spear tip point on it</i>

04:45.577 --> 04:48.036
and excellent chopping
capabilities.

04:48.080 --> 04:49.788
<i>My game plan is to work</i>

04:49.832 --> 04:52.082
<i>as fast as I possibly can
without messing up.</i>

04:52.126 --> 04:53.292
What's up?

04:53.335 --> 04:54.668
- What are you aiming for?

04:54.712 --> 04:56.169
I'm looking at
that rod in there.

04:56.213 --> 04:57.671
- I'm looking at the spring.

04:57.715 --> 05:00.090
- I got a spring off the back.

05:00.134 --> 05:01.591
- Do you?
- Yeah.

05:01.635 --> 05:03.135
I'd rather try to get
one of these and...

05:03.178 --> 05:05.012
- Here.
Yeah, I'll go take the back one.

05:05.055 --> 05:07.556
You take this one.
- Yeah.

05:07.599 --> 05:09.308
- Mardi went ahead
and told Morgan

05:09.351 --> 05:10.559
to take his coil spring,

05:10.602 --> 05:12.436
and he's going for the axle.

05:12.479 --> 05:15.272
<i>- I'm pretty resourceful
with auto parts.</i>

05:15.316 --> 05:17.649
I've done that much
in my career.

05:17.693 --> 05:21.361
<i>I just didn't want to mess
with too many pieces.</i>

05:21.405 --> 05:23.530
Coil springs can be very skinny,

05:23.574 --> 05:26.616
<i>so I would have to
cut that into pieces</i>

05:26.660 --> 05:28.744
<i>and combine it
and put it together,</i>

05:28.787 --> 05:31.413
and it seems like a lot of work.

05:31.457 --> 05:34.333
<i>I'm going to make a nice seax.</i>

05:34.376 --> 05:36.418
<i>I wanted to make
a nice, beefy cutting blade.</i>

05:36.462 --> 05:38.086
<i>That way it has a lot of support</i>

05:38.130 --> 05:40.297
for going through
difficult material

05:40.341 --> 05:43.175
like tire and jumper cables.

05:43.218 --> 05:44.885
<i>¶ ¶</i>

05:44.928 --> 05:48.138
- Oh, man,
that's a railroad hammer.

05:48.182 --> 05:51.141
<i>¶ ¶</i>

05:51.185 --> 05:53.602
- So Travis is getting
that coil spring.

05:53.645 --> 05:55.520
- It looks like they all went
for the coil springs,

05:55.564 --> 05:57.189
except Mardi.

05:57.232 --> 05:59.358
<i>- I'm going to make
a recurved blade.</i>

05:59.401 --> 06:01.943
<i>Definitely some
Persian influence.</i>

06:01.987 --> 06:05.280
Nothing chops
quite like a recurved.

06:05.324 --> 06:07.532
<i>I go ahead and go
for the coil springs</i>

06:07.576 --> 06:09.326
<i>'cause once I have the torch</i>

06:09.370 --> 06:11.328
I know I can just cut
those suckers right down there,

06:11.372 --> 06:12.621
make whatever loops.

06:12.664 --> 06:13.830
They'll all be the same length.

06:13.874 --> 06:15.415
I'll straighten the suckers out.

06:15.459 --> 06:17.000
I'll forge weld
the sons of bitches together,

06:17.044 --> 06:18.627
and I have a blade.

06:18.670 --> 06:21.254
<i>But I just keep having
problems with the torch.</i>

06:21.298 --> 06:23.757
Fire, fire, fire!

06:23.801 --> 06:25.550
[chuckles]

06:25.594 --> 06:27.219
- Well, it's a good thing
we have fire safety

06:27.262 --> 06:29.388
on standby today.

06:29.431 --> 06:31.723
<i>¶ ¶</i>

06:31.767 --> 06:33.767
- Travis is back
on the hot wrench.

06:33.811 --> 06:35.310
- The thing is, we've seen
that the hot wrench

06:35.354 --> 06:36.895
is a slow way to do this,

06:36.939 --> 06:38.939
that there's a lot
of flammable material

06:38.982 --> 06:40.732
left around that piece.

06:40.776 --> 06:42.275
Go to the grinder.
- Yeah.

06:42.319 --> 06:45.195
- Cut to the chase.

06:45.239 --> 06:48.073
<i>- That took a little longer
than I meant to,</i>

06:48.117 --> 06:50.951
but now I can stack up
as much as I can

06:50.994 --> 06:53.829
and... and hope for the best.

06:53.872 --> 06:57.290
- Bladesmiths,
one hour has elapsed!

06:57.334 --> 06:59.960
You have three hours remaining!

07:00.003 --> 07:03.797
<i>[rock music]</i>

07:03.841 --> 07:06.466
- I am incredibly relieved
right now

07:06.510 --> 07:08.385
that this piece
of steel is solid.

07:08.429 --> 07:10.095
<i>I'm getting less stressed,</i>

07:10.139 --> 07:12.681
and I'm getting more excited
about the piece.

07:12.724 --> 07:16.852
<i>¶ ¶</i>

07:16.895 --> 07:18.437
- Well, if we're going
by the beard competition,

07:18.480 --> 07:20.647
Tom is way ahead of everyone.

07:20.691 --> 07:22.232
He's got that awesome beard.

07:22.276 --> 07:23.984
- Oh, there it goes!
- Which he just tucked in.

07:24.027 --> 07:26.194
- That's how he keeps it.

07:27.614 --> 07:35.412
<i>¶ ¶</i>

07:35.456 --> 07:37.330
- Oh, [bleep].

07:37.374 --> 07:41.209
- Oh, we got... we got a hot mess
happening over here.

07:41.253 --> 07:43.962
<i>- It's still not
sticking together</i>

07:44.006 --> 07:46.006
as well as what I need it to.

07:46.049 --> 07:48.508
- Oh, wow.
- Oh, man.

07:48.552 --> 07:50.385
- All the gaps in between there,

07:50.429 --> 07:52.095
you can't just force 'em closed.

07:52.139 --> 07:54.431
- Yeah, that's... yeah.
- You gotta work them out.

07:54.475 --> 07:57.476
He's really got to change
his game plan up.

07:57.519 --> 07:59.895
- I don't want to be seen as,
like, some little, young punk

07:59.938 --> 08:02.230
who thought he could do this
but really can't.

08:02.274 --> 08:05.400
<i>[tense music]</i>

08:05.444 --> 08:07.444
<i>An hour and a half has passed by</i>

08:07.488 --> 08:10.739
and I've decided to
just scrap my first project.

08:10.782 --> 08:13.617
It's not worth the time
that I'm putting into it.

08:13.660 --> 08:17.120
<i>So I'm gonna go ahead and
cut another solid piece off.</i>

08:17.164 --> 08:19.289
<i>[rock music]</i>

08:19.333 --> 08:20.957
- This is a smart move.
- Very smart.

08:21.001 --> 08:24.753
- A smart move
by a young competitor.

08:24.796 --> 08:28.048
<i>- I'm behind these other guys,
starting over fresh,</i>

08:28.091 --> 08:29.716
and I've really got
to pick things up

08:29.760 --> 08:33.261
and forge
and move a lot of metal.

08:33.305 --> 08:36.223
<i>¶ ¶</i>

08:36.266 --> 08:39.059
- Well, looks like Mardi's
way ahead of the competition.

08:39.102 --> 08:40.435
- Mardi's steel
is looking great.

08:40.479 --> 08:41.978
- Yeah.

08:42.022 --> 08:43.813
- Heck, he could just go
to the grinder right now.

08:43.857 --> 08:47.275
<i>¶ ¶</i>

08:47.319 --> 08:49.819
- He's got a lot of those
heavy hammer marks to grind out

08:49.863 --> 08:51.655
and it takes time.

08:51.698 --> 08:53.365
<i>¶ ¶</i>

08:53.408 --> 08:55.575
- [bleep].

08:55.619 --> 08:57.244
- What is that?

08:57.287 --> 08:59.704
- Oh, no, he's got
a chip in the edge.

08:59.748 --> 09:01.373
Do you see that?
- Oh, yeah.

09:01.416 --> 09:04.918
- Oh, it's a grinder bite.

09:04.962 --> 09:08.421
- One of the aluminum wheels
bumped the bevel of the blade

09:08.465 --> 09:11.716
and made a little...
A little blemish there,

09:11.760 --> 09:14.219
<i>but I still have plenty
of meat in the blade</i>

09:14.263 --> 09:18.598
to clean that up
and take care of it.

09:18.642 --> 09:22.018
<i>¶ ¶</i>

09:22.062 --> 09:25.188
- I'm regretting my decision
to use the coil springs

<i>and forge welding them together.</i>

09:27.401 --> 09:29.859
Son of a [bleep].

09:29.903 --> 09:31.695
Ah.

09:31.738 --> 09:34.864
- Travis is really
fighting with that billet.

09:34.908 --> 09:38.201
<i>- I just keep seeing
little problems with it.</i>

09:38.245 --> 09:39.744
[bleep].

09:39.788 --> 09:42.622
I think I'm going home.

09:42.666 --> 09:45.375
- Travis is in trouble now.
- Yeah.

09:45.419 --> 09:47.711
- [bleep] this.

09:47.754 --> 09:50.839
Just too [bleep] stupid.
Just too [bleep] stupid.

09:58.849 --> 10:01.391
-<i> Once I got to forge welding,</i>

10:01.435 --> 10:04.352
I didn't really stick my pieces
together very well.

10:04.396 --> 10:07.314
- Travis is really
fighting with that billet.

10:09.109 --> 10:13.653
- Once I see that basically
everybody is done forging,

10:13.697 --> 10:17.574
<i>and I still have pieces
of coil spring</i>

10:17.618 --> 10:19.034
that are just...

10:19.077 --> 10:21.411
not sticking...

10:21.455 --> 10:22.787
All right.

10:22.831 --> 10:24.456
I tossed that sucker.

10:24.499 --> 10:25.832
- Gone.

10:25.876 --> 10:27.000
- He's done.
He's done with that.

10:27.044 --> 10:28.001

10:33.675 --> 10:36.718
Travis has one big hunk
of axle there.

10:36.762 --> 10:40.138
I have no doubt he's gonna get
that piece of metal hot

10:40.182 --> 10:42.557
and just start
drawing it out beautifully.

10:42.601 --> 10:44.267

- Bladesmiths, you have
90 minutes remaining!

90 minutes!

10:51.943 --> 10:53.818
<i>[rock music]</i>

10:53.862 --> 10:55.570
<i>- I'm going to heat treat,</i>

10:55.614 --> 10:58.365
and I'm going to be incredibly
cautious in my setup.

10:58.408 --> 11:01.618
<i>I made sure the oil
was screaming hot.</i>

11:03.330 --> 11:04.371
- We got a quench.

11:07.250 --> 11:10.585
- Oh, he's got a little bend
in it, it looks like.

11:10.629 --> 11:12.253
- He kept heating that blade

11:12.297 --> 11:14.673
on the outside of the forge
on one side and not both.

11:14.716 --> 11:17.676
- But he has an hour
to fix that.

11:17.719 --> 11:20.970
- So now it's a real
[bleep] blade.

11:21.014 --> 11:23.515
I don't know how the [bleep]
that happened.

back in the game.</i>

11:28.980 --> 11:30.980
I'm definitely
feeling better now.

11:31.024 --> 11:34.734
- Look how quickly Morgan
came out with that shape.

11:34.778 --> 11:36.653
<i>¶ ¶</i>

11:36.697 --> 11:38.363
<i>- The most important part
of this blade</i>

11:38.407 --> 11:40.323
is gonna be getting
the heat treat correct

11:40.367 --> 11:43.326
<i>and not pinging
or cracking the blade at all.</i>

11:43.370 --> 11:45.078
- There he is,
he's in the quench

11:45.122 --> 11:46.955
and that looked beautiful.
- Morgan's in the quench.

11:46.998 --> 11:48.540
<i>- I didn't feel any pings</i>

11:48.583 --> 11:51.334
and the blade stayed
very, very straight.

11:51.378 --> 11:54.087
I'm very happy
I didn't mess up again.

11:54.131 --> 11:55.463

11:55.507 --> 11:57.799
That would have killed me.
- This is great.

11:57.843 --> 12:00.427
We're seeing people take
the time with their quench.

12:00.470 --> 12:02.512
This should always
be done this way,

12:02.556 --> 12:05.306

speed quenches

12:05.350 --> 12:08.184

that make me so crazy.

Travis in the oil.

<i>- Once I threw away
my first blade</i>

12:13.608 --> 12:16.317

to start with,

12:16.361 --> 12:19.237
<i>I had no problem.</i>

12:19.281 --> 12:20.864
- 15 minutes!

12:20.907 --> 12:25.326
Bladesmiths, you have
15 minutes remaining!

12:25.370 --> 12:28.496
<i>- I didn't realize they all
already quenched their blades.</i>

12:28.540 --> 12:32.375
I have to start thinking
about when I'm doing mine.

12:32.419 --> 12:35.670
- The big question right now
is Mardi with this heat treat.

12:35.714 --> 12:39.174
He's got a very, very thin,
very wide blade.

12:39.217 --> 12:41.509
There's a lot
that can go on there.

12:41.553 --> 12:44.637

he's gonna have to fix it fast.

- I have a perfectly good,
operational blade.

13:27.933 --> 13:30.266
It doesn't have
quite the finish and stuff

like to do,

13:43.073 --> 13:44.823
your first round challenge

13:44.866 --> 13:47.700
was to harvest usable steel
from a wrecked car

13:47.744 --> 13:51.788
to build a signature blade
of your own design.

13:51.832 --> 13:54.916
Tom, please present your blade
to the judges.

13:54.960 --> 13:58.336
<i>[rock music]</i>

13:58.380 --> 14:00.547
-<i> Well, Tom, it's so clean</i>

14:00.590 --> 14:02.799
and this is still round one.

14:02.843 --> 14:04.801
Kudos for going the extra mile

14:04.845 --> 14:07.345
to turn in a beautiful piece.

14:07.389 --> 14:09.681
- You went as far
as to sharpen this edge.

14:09.724 --> 14:12.225
That could be dangerous
going into round two.

14:12.269 --> 14:15.395
Are you a little worried
about going into a second round

14:15.438 --> 14:17.939
and having to deal
with that blade?

14:17.983 --> 14:20.358
- I'll just tape it up.
It'll be fine.

14:20.402 --> 14:21.901
- Brave man.

14:21.945 --> 14:23.403

14:30.328 --> 14:32.078
<i>with the coil spring,</i>

14:32.122 --> 14:33.413
it looked like maybe you were

14:33.456 --> 14:34.831
getting a little
impatient with it

14:34.875 --> 14:36.457
and then started
trying to force it.

14:36.501 --> 14:37.667
What happened?

14:37.711 --> 14:41.129
- [bleep] happened.
A lot.

14:41.172 --> 14:43.464
- Once you shifted
gears, though,

14:43.508 --> 14:46.259
you had this shaped
within 20 minutes.

14:46.303 --> 14:48.386
Good job.

14:48.430 --> 14:51.514
- Mardi, please present
your blade to the judges.

14:51.558 --> 14:54.809
<i>[rock music]</i>

14:54.853 --> 14:57.520
<i>- Mardi, I like the seax design.</i>

14:57.564 --> 15:01.107
For such a broad knife,
it's thin and light.

15:01.151 --> 15:03.693
And as I always say, it doesn't
have to be thick and heavy

15:03.737 --> 15:06.571
to be a strong knife,
so nicely done.

15:06.615 --> 15:08.197
- Thank you.

15:08.241 --> 15:11.659
- I saw at one point you
kind of hit a spot down here,

15:11.703 --> 15:12.952
got a big wiggle in it.

15:12.996 --> 15:14.836
- When I was tapering the tang,

15:14.873 --> 15:16.956
I bumped into one
of the aluminum drive wheels.

15:17.000 --> 15:19.167
- Gotcha, okay.

Well done.

- Thank you.

15:32.641 --> 15:35.016

a slight bit of a twist

15:35.060 --> 15:37.018
<i>when looking down the blade,</i>

15:37.062 --> 15:40.063

you made show such maturity

15:44.069 --> 15:45.818
in the skills that you do.

15:45.862 --> 15:48.422
It goes to show that you
don't have to be an old guy

15:48.448 --> 15:50.114
to be able to make great blades.

15:50.158 --> 15:52.825
That's beautiful to see,
especially with the craft

15:52.869 --> 15:55.828

to push over here.

lend me a knife, please?

finally.

16:17.519 --> 16:19.352

16:19.396 --> 16:23.106
- Okay, judges, these
are the most finished blades

16:23.149 --> 16:26.150
we've ever had come out
of round one, as a group.

16:26.194 --> 16:29.362
Let's go ahead and start
with Tom's blade on the end.

16:29.406 --> 16:32.365
- He's actually given us
a bit of a false edge

16:32.409 --> 16:34.200
up on the tip here.

16:34.244 --> 16:37.245
Not sharp, but sharp enough
that it's gonna, you know,

16:37.288 --> 16:39.706
split that rubber
when it goes into the tire.

16:39.749 --> 16:42.709
He's obviously designed
for the challenges.

16:42.752 --> 16:46.587
- All right, let's move on
to Travis' blade.

16:46.631 --> 16:48.297
-<i> I've got to give props.</i>

16:48.341 --> 16:50.466
This is a round one challenge,

16:50.510 --> 16:53.094
and he's turned in
an almost finished blade.

16:53.138 --> 16:55.471
- He did a very nice job
on the grind,

16:55.515 --> 16:58.641
and, you know, the finish
is just beautiful.

16:58.685 --> 17:01.352
- I think my chances are good.
I got a blade.

17:01.396 --> 17:04.981
It's hard and meets
the length requirements.

17:05.025 --> 17:07.567
<i>- Let's move on
to Mardi's blade.</i>

17:07.610 --> 17:10.194
- I like where
Mardi is going with this,

17:10.238 --> 17:14.282
but his plunge grinds
are extremely off-center.

17:14.325 --> 17:15.867
- Oh, yeah.

17:15.910 --> 17:18.703
All in all, there are
defects in this blade

17:18.747 --> 17:21.307
that I'm not seeing
in the other two

17:21.332 --> 17:23.875
that we've looked at so far.

17:23.918 --> 17:27.003
- All right, let's talk
about Morgan's blade.

17:27.047 --> 17:28.588
- Got the integral guard.

17:28.631 --> 17:29.839
I mean, it's a little bit off,

17:29.883 --> 17:31.215
<i>but that's easy to clean up</i>

17:31.259 --> 17:33.551
<i>during the fitting up process.</i>

17:33.595 --> 17:35.636
Little bit of a twist
in the blade.

17:35.680 --> 17:37.430
In a lot of our challenges

17:37.474 --> 17:40.516
that we've had in the past
those would be acceptable,

17:40.560 --> 17:43.352
but the bar
has been raised here.

17:43.396 --> 17:46.981
- So, judges,
have you made a decision?

17:47.025 --> 17:48.649
- Yeah.

17:48.693 --> 17:50.860

the quality of work

one of the toughest decisions

<i>¶ ¶</i>

18:14.260 --> 18:15.676
Mardi,

18:15.720 --> 18:18.638
your blade did not make the cut.

18:18.681 --> 18:21.516
- Each and every one of you
turned in a beautiful blade,

18:21.559 --> 18:24.894
and it's because of that we had
to look at the finer details.

18:24.938 --> 18:27.355
Your plunge grinds were uneven,

18:27.398 --> 18:30.608
and there were more creases
and visible waves on your blade

18:30.652 --> 18:32.068
compared to the others,

18:32.112 --> 18:34.487
and for that we have
to let you go.

18:56.886 --> 18:59.178
You've made it through
to the second round.

18:59.222 --> 19:01.806
Your challenge is to craft
and attach a handle

19:01.850 --> 19:03.641
to your blades using the range

19:03.685 --> 19:05.268
of materials provided to you,

19:05.311 --> 19:07.645
turning them into
fully functional weapons.

19:07.689 --> 19:09.814
You will have three hours
for this round.

19:09.858 --> 19:12.692
You can use that time
to address any flaws or issues

19:12.735 --> 19:15.945
that were identified
with your blades.

19:15.989 --> 19:19.323
It will then be tested
for strength and durability,

19:28.668 --> 19:30.376

19:30.420 --> 19:33.796
Good luck, bladesmiths.

19:35.258 --> 19:38.092

- All right.

19:38.136 --> 19:39.802
- The shop is like a pool table,

19:39.846 --> 19:42.847
and we got three balls bouncing
around the corner pockets.

19:42.891 --> 19:44.599
<i>- I really want to make a handle</i>

19:44.642 --> 19:47.560
that gives the blade

19:47.604 --> 19:49.395
Oh, there we go.
Now we're talking.

19:49.439 --> 19:52.565
And the black micarta

19:52.609 --> 19:56.360

You adapt, you move on,

20:25.433 --> 20:28.935
you find another blade,
and you don't stop.

20:28.978 --> 20:31.020

Just keep building.

20:31.064 --> 20:32.480

20:44.619 --> 20:45.993

20:46.037 --> 20:47.745

my point to make it stabbier.

you got a good point.

20:56.339 --> 20:58.589

a technical term.

for a stabilized wood block

I need to put
some sort of guard on it,

21:11.437 --> 21:13.729
<i>so that's gonna pose an issue.</i>

21:13.773 --> 21:15.106
That is insanely prettier.

21:15.149 --> 21:16.649
<i>It's all down to the details,</i>

21:16.693 --> 21:18.943
and I need to make sure
I get these details right.

21:18.987 --> 21:20.945
I added this piece in here.

21:20.989 --> 21:23.489
That way when you're stabbing,
your hand doesn't slide forward.

21:23.533 --> 21:25.032
I needed more metal.

21:25.076 --> 21:28.411
- Bladesmiths, you have
only two hours remaining

21:28.454 --> 21:29.870

21:33.334 --> 21:34.792

21:34.836 --> 21:37.420
The glue-up is always
a moment of tension,

21:37.463 --> 21:39.213
<i>because you're dealing
with a material</i>

21:39.257 --> 21:41.465
that's setting
and you can't stop it.

21:41.509 --> 21:43.217
And so once
the chemical reaction starts,

21:43.261 --> 21:46.095

It's time

22:31.601 --> 22:33.517

22:33.561 --> 22:35.361
I can just hold it there

23:38.042 --> 23:40.209
- I can just glue that little
piece right back in place

23:40.253 --> 23:42.253

simply because he didn't
put a guard on that.

24:04.277 --> 24:06.026
It's a very skinny handle,

24:06.070 --> 24:08.630

I'm gonna take
each of your blades

24:53.117 --> 24:55.242

the tip through

24:55.286 --> 24:58.204

around these tires.

25:31.364 --> 25:34.240
- Looking at the edge,
I do see some shiny spots,

25:34.283 --> 25:36.700
so you might have lost
a little bit of your edge.

25:48.923 --> 25:50.756

control with the handle,

slide through that tire cleanly.

26:48.566 --> 26:52.192

your edge held up very well,

26:52.236 --> 26:54.194
but bit of trouble
getting that tip in.

26:54.238 --> 26:55.878
Really had to shove
to get that in there...

26:55.906 --> 26:57.823
And that thin handle...

26:57.867 --> 27:00.492
But everything held together,

27:00.536 --> 27:02.620
and I don't see any shine

To test your weapon's edge,

27:14.634 --> 27:16.675
I'll slash through
these jumper cables.

27:16.719 --> 27:19.511
If it's sharp, it should cut
right through cleanly.

27:34.070 --> 27:36.320
It cut cleanly
through the cable,

27:36.364 --> 27:38.781
but your handle's a little
on the skinny side,

27:38.824 --> 27:40.616
kind of rolls on the hand.

27:40.660 --> 27:42.951
But nonetheless, it will cut.

27:42.995 --> 27:44.286
Good job.

- Thank you.
- Travis, you're up.

you can almost feel
the curve of your blade.

28:01.847 --> 28:04.431
It's a sharp blade

A little rounded on the handle

Even in other movements,

28:30.751 --> 28:33.544
I can feel it

29:41.697 --> 29:43.489
Your piece wasn't
developed as much

29:43.532 --> 29:45.574
for the testing
as your competitors

29:45.618 --> 29:47.618
and that showed
in the tire slice.

29:47.661 --> 29:49.620
Had more trouble
with the penetration

29:49.663 --> 29:52.206
<i>and more trouble with
the blade wandering around,</i>

29:52.249 --> 29:53.999
and that's a big reason
we have to let you go.

29:54.043 --> 29:56.627
- That's fair.
Thank you.

29:58.798 --> 30:02.466
- Tom, please surrender
your weapon.

30:02.510 --> 30:04.343
<i>- I feel like I did great.</i>

30:04.386 --> 30:08.847
I made a functional blade
out of a coil spring from a car.

30:08.891 --> 30:10.766
<i>I didn't outright
fail at anything.</i>

30:10.810 --> 30:12.059
I just wasn't quite as good

30:12.102 --> 30:13.519
as the other ones,
so that's okay.

30:13.562 --> 30:14.562
I'd do it again.

30:14.605 --> 30:16.980
[laughs]

30:18.734 --> 30:21.235
<i>¶ ¶</i>

30:21.278 --> 30:23.654
- Morgan, Travis,
congratulations.

30:23.697 --> 30:26.031
You're both moving on
to the final round.

30:26.075 --> 30:28.867
When you arrived here,
you forged blades

30:28.911 --> 30:31.411
in your signature style,
of your own design.

30:31.455 --> 30:35.040
Now we're sending you home
to forge an iconic blade

30:35.084 --> 30:38.710
that is thousands of years old.

30:38.754 --> 30:41.839
<i>¶ ¶</i>

30:41.882 --> 30:42.840
- Oh, yeah.

30:42.883 --> 30:45.759
- The Viking sword.

30:45.803 --> 30:48.720
<i>The Vikings, originating
from Scandinavia,</i>

30:48.764 --> 30:51.765
<i>raided wide areas
of northern and central Europe</i>

30:51.809 --> 30:54.226
<i>from the 8th to 11th centuries.</i>

30:54.270 --> 30:57.271
<i>The Viking sword was derived
from the Roman spatha</i>

30:57.314 --> 31:00.399
<i>and was seen as a matter
of high prestige and wealth.</i>

31:00.442 --> 31:02.359
<i>The large double-edged weapon</i>

31:02.403 --> 31:05.070
<i>was often used in battle
along with the shield.</i>

31:05.114 --> 31:08.198
<i>It often had a fuller running
along the length of the blade,</i>

31:08.242 --> 31:10.742
<i>increasing the strength
and flexibility</i>

31:10.786 --> 31:13.036
<i>while also reducing the weight.</i>

31:13.080 --> 31:15.747
<i>The hilt and pommel
provided balance to the weapon,</i>

31:15.791 --> 31:19.293
<i>helping the swordsman to swing
the blade at his enemy.</i>

31:19.336 --> 31:22.004
<i>This iconic weapon
has been immortalized</i>

31:22.047 --> 31:24.464
<i>in films like "King Arthur."</i>

31:24.508 --> 31:28.218
<i>¶ ¶</i>

31:28.262 --> 31:32.639
It must be a working version
of that deadly weapon.

31:32.683 --> 31:35.100
You will have five days
in your home forge.

31:35.144 --> 31:37.185
At the end of five days,
you will return

31:37.229 --> 31:40.397
and present your finished
Viking swords to our judges,

31:40.441 --> 31:44.026
who will then subject them
to a series of tests.

31:44.069 --> 31:46.029
Only after those tests
are complete

31:46.071 --> 31:49.281
will they declare one of you
the "Forged in Fire" champion,

31:49.325 --> 31:52.743
who receives a check
for $10,000.

31:52.786 --> 31:55.954
<i>- The Vikings had said
the best blade was quenched</i>

31:55.998 --> 31:58.540
<i>in the piss
of a redheaded virgin.</i>

31:58.584 --> 32:00.083
I don't know
any redheaded virgins,

32:00.127 --> 32:03.170
but I imagine
oil will be just fine.

32:03.213 --> 32:04.379
- Good luck, bladesmiths.

32:04.423 --> 32:05.964
We'll see you in five days.

32:06.008 --> 32:08.425
- Good luck.
- Good luck, man.

<i>[rock music]</i>

32:11.472 --> 32:13.972
<i>¶ ¶</i>

32:14.016 --> 32:16.516
Today is day one
of the Viking sword build,

32:16.560 --> 32:19.811
<i>and just want to get
my layout nice.</i>

32:19.855 --> 32:21.939
<i>Your layout's pretty important.</i>

32:21.982 --> 32:23.690
<i>There's nothing worse
than running around</i>

32:23.734 --> 32:27.152
<i>with a 36-inch piece
of really hot steel</i>

32:27.196 --> 32:30.948
in a non-feng shui
environment.

32:30.991 --> 32:33.784
<i>¶ ¶</i>

32:33.827 --> 32:36.870
I kind of rummaged
through the farm scrapyard.

32:36.914 --> 32:39.581
This is actually
an arm off a chisel plow.

32:39.625 --> 32:42.417
<i>It's spring steel,
tougher than hell.</i>

32:42.461 --> 32:45.963
<i>So I figure
since I have good steel,</i>

32:46.006 --> 32:47.506
I'm not gonna do
a pattern-welded blade.

32:47.549 --> 32:49.257
Strike while it's hot.

32:49.301 --> 32:51.093
<i>I'm gonna do something
that's gonna perform</i>

32:51.136 --> 32:52.886
<i>without the likelihood
of failure.</i>

32:52.930 --> 32:55.597
I think it just kind of laughs
at my hammer at this point.

32:55.641 --> 32:57.516
<i>Day one, I feel good because</i>

32:57.559 --> 32:59.518
essentially
I'm figuring out the tools,

32:59.561 --> 33:01.103
<i>and so tomorrow?</i>

33:01.146 --> 33:03.689
<i>Put them to use.</i>

33:03.732 --> 33:05.941
<i>¶ ¶</i>

33:05.985 --> 33:10.153
- Game plan on day one
is to make my Damascus billet.

33:10.197 --> 33:14.074
What really sets our blades
apart is gonna be the artwork.

33:14.118 --> 33:16.451
I figure if I'm gonna
make a Damascus billet,

33:16.495 --> 33:19.871
I might as well make it
complicated and look nice.

33:19.915 --> 33:24.209
Normally we've got, like,
two guys that do this.

33:24.253 --> 33:25.961
You can actually
see the pattern already.

33:26.005 --> 33:27.629
Those are the actual layers

33:27.673 --> 33:29.381
and what it's gonna look like
when it draws out.

33:29.425 --> 33:31.550
That's looking good.
I like that, I like that a lot.

33:31.593 --> 33:34.553
I'm just gonna clean it
really quick and call it a day.

33:34.596 --> 33:38.557
<i>¶ ¶</i>

33:38.600 --> 33:40.475
- Those little
whooshes are still enough

33:40.519 --> 33:41.852
to take off eyelashes.

33:41.895 --> 33:43.478
Well, day two, I have my steel

33:43.522 --> 33:45.605
in the basic shape
of the Viking sword.

33:45.649 --> 33:48.942
So we're gonna start forging
in the fuller and the bevels.

33:48.986 --> 33:51.403
So the fuller down the middle
makes a lighter, stronger blade,

33:51.447 --> 33:53.989
or a stronger blade
of given weight.

33:54.033 --> 33:55.782
And they're cool.

33:55.826 --> 33:59.911
By the end of the day,
I plan to have a finished blade.

33:59.955 --> 34:01.621
There we go.

34:01.665 --> 34:03.498
What could go wrong, right?

34:03.542 --> 34:05.876
<i>¶ ¶</i>

34:05.919 --> 34:07.961
Everything's lightening up,

34:08.005 --> 34:09.755
and everything's
coming in straight,

34:09.798 --> 34:11.339
so I'm gonna
dangle it in the forge

34:11.383 --> 34:14.176
and quench it once.

34:14.219 --> 34:16.553
<i>I don't know
what's gonna happen here,</i>

34:16.597 --> 34:18.597
<i>and I don't know
what the forge is gonna do</i>

34:18.640 --> 34:20.474
<i>in the vertical position,</i>

34:20.517 --> 34:23.018
and I don't know
if I can get an even heat.

34:23.062 --> 34:25.812
All right, here we go.

34:25.856 --> 34:28.565
I don't know, even, if I'm at
the right temperature.

34:28.609 --> 34:30.484
Oh, that's gonna happen!

34:30.527 --> 34:31.693
Uh-oh.

34:31.737 --> 34:35.197
<i>¶ ¶</i>

34:35.240 --> 34:36.990
Dun-dun-dun.

34:37.034 --> 34:40.243
<i>¶ ¶</i>

34:40.287 --> 34:42.579
Pretty straight.

34:42.623 --> 34:44.456
Ow, still hot.

34:44.500 --> 34:49.795
<i>¶ ¶</i>

34:52.466 --> 34:56.218
It ain't done, but it will kill.

35:05.312 --> 35:06.937
- Today is day three,

35:06.980 --> 35:09.397
and my plan is to finish up
my blade completely.

35:09.441 --> 35:11.900
<i>[rock music]</i>

35:11.944 --> 35:14.277
At the very tip of my blade
my steel didn't forge well,

35:14.321 --> 35:16.404
so I want to draw out
that whole end

35:16.448 --> 35:18.532
so that I can then grind
all of that weld off.

35:18.575 --> 35:21.827
<i>¶ ¶</i>

35:21.870 --> 35:23.411
If I have an uneven heat,

35:23.455 --> 35:25.413
it'll cause my blade
to warp when I quench,

35:25.457 --> 35:27.624
or it'll heat treat unevenly,

35:27.668 --> 35:29.668
which will produce
soft spots in my blade.

35:29.711 --> 35:31.391
This is make or break
moment for any blade.

35:31.421 --> 35:34.131
There's always stuff
that goes wrong.

35:34.174 --> 35:35.507
Ooh.

35:35.551 --> 35:37.134
[bleep].

35:37.177 --> 35:43.014
<i>¶ ¶</i>

35:43.058 --> 35:46.476
Oh, [bleep] it.

35:46.520 --> 35:48.186
That would be it.

35:48.230 --> 35:51.106
So I feel really good
about how hard my blade is,

35:51.150 --> 35:54.359
but I won't really know
until later, for sure.

35:54.403 --> 35:56.862
[rooster crows]

35:56.905 --> 35:58.280
<i>- So it's day four.</i>

35:58.323 --> 36:00.282
<i>My concern is my blade
is not as hard</i>

36:00.325 --> 36:01.908
as it's supposed to be.

36:01.952 --> 36:03.535
I like intentionally
breaking stuff,

36:03.579 --> 36:05.787
not having stuff break on me.

36:05.831 --> 36:09.457
So this morning I'm just
gonna do a few tests.

36:12.588 --> 36:14.129
If anything's gonna happen,

36:14.173 --> 36:16.506
I'm gonna find it
before the judges do.

36:16.550 --> 36:18.175
Nothing like testing.

36:18.218 --> 36:23.138
<i>¶ ¶</i>

36:23.182 --> 36:25.849
I'm no longer concerned
about my steel.

36:25.893 --> 36:28.310
<i>Took quite a bit
to break off that tip,</i>

36:28.353 --> 36:30.770
so it seems tougher than hell.

36:30.814 --> 36:33.106
<i>I am pretty sure
it's gonna withstand anything</i>

36:33.150 --> 36:35.275
the judges throw at it.

36:35.319 --> 36:37.485
[bleep] damn it, knock on wood.

37:17.194 --> 37:19.945
Hmm, [bleep], that sucks.

37:19.988 --> 37:23.531
The delamination, little bit
seems to have separated enough,

37:23.575 --> 37:25.242
got coconut in it.

37:25.285 --> 37:27.953

how to get these out.

37:27.996 --> 37:30.914

37:30.958 --> 37:34.084
I think I might have lost

It's still flexible,
which is not good.

Salvageable?
No.

38:33.228 --> 38:35.437
You've had five days
at your home forge

38:35.480 --> 38:37.147
to work on your Viking swords.

38:37.190 --> 38:40.317
Travis, how did it go?
- It was interesting.

38:40.360 --> 38:42.986
<i>You know, I wasn't exactly sure
what steel I was working with,</i>

38:43.030 --> 38:44.696
<i>but I know it's
tougher than hell.</i>

38:44.740 --> 38:46.573
<i>I'm happy with the way
it turned out.</i>

38:46.616 --> 38:48.825
Maybe it's a little heavy,
but it felt good to me,

38:48.869 --> 38:51.119
so we'll see how it does.

38:51.163 --> 38:54.205
- Great.
Morgan, how'd it go?

38:54.249 --> 38:56.583
- I had some stuff go wrong
with the blade.

38:56.626 --> 38:59.294
<i>I had a couple delaminations
in my Damascus.</i>

38:59.338 --> 39:01.880
<i>I went back and I braised them,
I lost my heat treat,</i>

39:01.923 --> 39:03.757
<i>and when that happened
and my blade cracked,</i>

39:03.800 --> 39:06.384
that was pretty rough.

39:06.428 --> 39:08.136
- All right, gentlemen,

39:08.180 --> 39:10.805
your weapons will now be put
through a series of three tests.

39:10.849 --> 39:13.016
Up first is the kill test.

39:13.060 --> 39:14.601
Doug.

39:14.644 --> 39:16.978
- Bladesmiths,
this is the kill test.

39:17.022 --> 39:19.856
The Viking sword was designed
to be a single-handed weapon,

39:19.900 --> 39:22.317
used to breach through
an enemy's defenses,

39:22.361 --> 39:24.778
delivering a thrust,
a chop, and a slice.

39:24.821 --> 39:26.863
To test how lethal
your weapon is

39:26.907 --> 39:28.948
I will breach through
this simulated sword,

39:28.992 --> 39:31.284
and then deliver
a thrust, slice,

39:31.328 --> 39:33.248
and chop
on this ballistics dummy.

39:33.288 --> 39:36.081
Let's see how much lethal damage
your weapon can do.

39:36.124 --> 39:37.499
Travis, you're up.
Are you ready?

39:37.542 --> 39:39.125
- Yep.

it was a little bit heavy.

40:01.358 --> 40:04.692
<i>definitely will cleave
through anything in its path.</i>

40:04.736 --> 40:07.153
If you had a little bit more
weight in the back over here,

40:07.197 --> 40:08.363
that would have really

40:08.407 --> 40:10.240
definitely
counterbalanced the blade.

40:10.283 --> 40:11.741
But nonetheless,

40:11.785 --> 40:14.869
that's a beautiful-looking
sword.

40:14.913 --> 40:18.289
This, sir, will kill.

40:18.333 --> 40:19.333
- Thank you.

40:19.376 --> 40:20.500
- Morgan, you're next.

40:20.544 --> 40:22.144
You ready?
- Yep.

40:22.170 --> 40:24.170
- Let's do this.
- All right.

40:26.633 --> 40:29.592
<i>[rock music]</i>

40:29.636 --> 40:37.350
<i>¶ ¶</i>

40:37.394 --> 40:39.769
<i>- I was really
striving for perfection.</i>

40:39.813 --> 40:41.771
So you take a risk
and sometimes it pays off

40:41.815 --> 40:43.815
and sometimes it doesn't.

40:43.859 --> 40:46.025
- Okay...

40:46.069 --> 40:47.944
Morgan, there are
a couple of issues

40:47.988 --> 40:50.822
that we have here
with your sword.

40:50.866 --> 40:53.575
Number one, with the handle.

40:53.618 --> 40:56.077
It's loose.

40:56.121 --> 41:00.540
My biggest concern
is on your blade itself.

41:00.584 --> 41:03.543
Not only do I see cracks.

41:03.587 --> 41:08.339
I actually see holes
in your sword.

41:08.383 --> 41:09.466
Uh...

41:09.509 --> 41:11.718
<i>¶ ¶</i>

41:11.761 --> 41:15.263
Morgan, due to the issues
you have with your blade,

41:15.307 --> 41:16.848
for safety reasons

41:16.892 --> 41:18.683
we will not be able
to test your sword.

41:22.314 --> 41:24.647
That being said, though,

41:24.691 --> 41:26.733
thank you for
sticking with the challenge

41:26.776 --> 41:29.944
and presenting us
with a weapon today.

41:29.988 --> 41:32.989
- Gentlemen, because we cannot
test Morgan's sword,

41:33.033 --> 41:36.034
we will not move forward
with any other weapons tests.

41:36.077 --> 41:37.452
-<i> I knew it was coming.</i>

41:37.496 --> 41:38.995
<i>There was no doubts about it,</i>

41:39.039 --> 41:40.914
so, I mean, it kind of sucks,

41:40.957 --> 41:43.958
but, you know, it is what it is.

41:44.002 --> 41:47.504
<i>¶ ¶</i>

41:47.547 --> 41:49.839
- Morgan, Travis,

41:49.883 --> 41:51.843
you had five days
at your home forges

41:51.885 --> 41:54.636
to create your own version
of a Viking sword.

41:54.679 --> 41:58.348
You both made valiant efforts.

41:58.391 --> 42:00.642
Travis, congratulations.

42:00.685 --> 42:02.727
You are the
"Forged in Fire" champion.

42:02.771 --> 42:05.355
<i>[rock music]</i>

42:05.398 --> 42:06.648
- It's been fun, man.

42:06.691 --> 42:09.108
- Yeah.
- Morgan, I'm sorry.

42:09.152 --> 42:11.027
You did not make the cut.

42:11.071 --> 42:13.988
- Morgan, you are one
of the youngest smiths ever

42:14.032 --> 42:15.573
to grace this forge,

42:15.617 --> 42:18.618
but despite that,
you showed so much maturity

42:18.662 --> 42:20.620
from round one,
where you fell behind,

42:20.664 --> 42:23.289
and made it all the way
to the finals.

42:23.333 --> 42:26.125
- Morgan, please
surrender your weapon.

42:26.169 --> 42:27.877
<i>¶ ¶</i>

42:27.921 --> 42:30.421
- Morgan, thank you.
- Thank you.

42:30.465 --> 42:32.924
- Yeah, I definitely
agree with the decision.

42:32.968 --> 42:34.884
<i>You know, I didn't win,
but it's a pretty good feeling</i>

42:34.928 --> 42:36.469
to know that
I can make it this far,

42:36.513 --> 42:38.096
and I'm not that little kid
in the backyard

42:38.139 --> 42:41.099
tinkering around anymore.

42:41.142 --> 42:43.142
- Travis, congratulations.

42:43.186 --> 42:44.936
You are the
"Forged in Fire" champion

42:44.980 --> 42:47.897
and will be receiving
a check for $10,000.

42:47.941 --> 42:52.110
<i>¶ ¶</i>

42:52.153 --> 42:54.279
- You got a very,
very nice looking sword.

42:54.322 --> 42:55.780
<i>- Thank you.</i>

42:55.824 --> 42:57.448
<i>- Travis,
it's a beautiful blade.</i>

42:57.492 --> 42:58.950
It performed very well.

42:58.994 --> 43:00.827
<i>- This was a hell
of an experience.</i>

43:00.870 --> 43:04.414
It really tests a person's
ability to adapt under fire.
