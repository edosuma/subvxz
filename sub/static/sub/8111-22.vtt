00:37.413 --> 00:38.493
HOUSE: Hey.

00:45.004 --> 00:46.335
(GRUNTING)

00:59.727 --> 01:01.012
KUTNER: Don't bother.

01:01.854 --> 01:03.185
He's dead.

01:08.611 --> 01:10.272
You're dead, too.

01:12.531 --> 01:13.691
The fire isn't.

01:16.118 --> 01:17.733
(FIRE CRACKLING)

02:03.708 --> 02:06.074
You might want to get up
and start heading
for the exit signs.

02:06.210 --> 02:07.199
For all I know,

02:07.420 --> 02:09.911
I already am up.

02:10.047 --> 02:11.162
More interesting
question is,

02:11.257 --> 02:13.373
why would I hallucinate
an ex-employee

02:13.467 --> 02:16.209
who I last saw
with a self-inflicted
gunshot wound,

02:16.304 --> 02:19.137
as opposed to
someone more busty?

02:19.557 --> 02:21.297
Care to explain
why you're here?

02:21.392 --> 02:22.381
The dead guy.

02:23.060 --> 02:24.436
Who is he?

02:25.104 --> 02:26.890
How'd you meet him?

02:32.153 --> 02:33.814
I was in a car accident
last month.

02:34.780 --> 02:37.897
I won a swimming trophy
in high school.
Your turn.

02:39.577 --> 02:41.033
I ran out of
pain medication.

02:41.120 --> 02:43.907
I got an orbital fracture.
It's just taking ages
to heal.

02:43.998 --> 02:44.987
Take off your shirt.

02:45.916 --> 02:46.905
My eye's up here.

02:48.085 --> 02:50.337
Orbital fracture means
your face went
into the windshield.

02:50.421 --> 02:52.753
Which means your chest
went into the steering wheel.

02:52.840 --> 02:54.831
Painkillers can
suppress heart rate,

02:54.925 --> 02:56.085
so unless you want me
to kill you,

02:56.177 --> 02:57.963
take off your shirt,
let me do a heart exam.

03:08.564 --> 03:11.647
I also wanted to see
the ring of burns
around your co||arbone.

03:14.904 --> 03:16.485
How did you know?
The "codeine allergy"

03:16.614 --> 03:19.856
you told the nurse about,
that's shorthand for
"give me the strong stuff,"

03:19.950 --> 03:21.565
which matches
your seen-better-days

03:21.660 --> 03:23.116
-because-my-|ife-fell-apart
suit.

03:23.245 --> 03:24.530
The two old burns
on your fingers

03:24.622 --> 03:25.862
mean you tend to nod off
with a cigarette

03:25.956 --> 03:28.333
in your hand. No reason
you shouldn't do that
with one in your mouth.

03:28.834 --> 03:31.166
May all your doctors
be stupid.

03:33.089 --> 03:34.078
Hold on a second.

03:36.801 --> 03:38.462
That bruising
around your belly button.

03:42.807 --> 03:46.425
You might
get some fun drugs
out of this after all.

03:47.478 --> 03:48.718
HOUSE: Cullenâ€™s sign,

03:48.813 --> 03:52.806
but the ultrasound
showed air as well
as blood. Now,

03:52.942 --> 03:56.150
I know what you're thinking.
Hemorrhagic pancreatitis.

03:56.654 --> 03:58.144
But I also know
what I'm thinking.

03:58.239 --> 03:59.695
Doesn't explain
the pneumoperitoneum.

04:00.783 --> 04:01.863
You took a new case?

04:02.326 --> 04:04.112
You ran tests yourself?

04:05.329 --> 04:10.073
I saw the chance to
help someone in need,
and l instinctively...

04:10.167 --> 04:12.032
No, wait, that was
someone else's instincts.

04:12.169 --> 04:14.501
Wilson's dying,
your parole officer

04:14.588 --> 04:16.089
is probably
on his way here
right now.

04:16.173 --> 04:18.255
How are you possibly
in a good mood?

04:18.342 --> 04:21.675
Did you never see
Dead Poets Society?
Carpe diem.

04:22.346 --> 04:26.009
Air in his abdomen
could mean
blah, blah, blah.

04:26.142 --> 04:29.259
But blah, blah,
blah, blah, blah.

04:29.353 --> 04:30.513
Blah, blah, blah.

04:31.689 --> 04:33.179
Nobody cares
about the medicine.

04:33.649 --> 04:34.764
Perforated ulcer.

04:34.859 --> 04:36.941
Laparotomy to find
the hole in his tummy
and close it up.

04:37.027 --> 04:38.278
You didn't answer
the team's question.

04:38.362 --> 04:40.944
Which is weird 'cause
normally when I talk
to my own employees,

04:41.031 --> 04:43.022
l'm under oath
and hooked up to
a lie detector.

04:43.117 --> 04:44.573
You were looking at
six months of prison

04:44.660 --> 04:46.025
instead of five months
of Wilson.

04:46.162 --> 04:47.117
Why happy?

04:47.204 --> 04:48.364
Obviously I had a plan.

04:48.456 --> 04:49.946
Obviously,
obviously you had a plan.

04:50.040 --> 04:51.166
The more
interesting question is,

04:51.250 --> 04:52.706
why you didn't
tell the team.

04:52.835 --> 04:54.575
I think it's because
part of you knew
from the start

04:54.670 --> 04:56.501
that the plan
wouldn't work.

05:01.051 --> 05:02.211
HOUSE: I need a meeting.

05:02.303 --> 05:03.543
I'm busy.
Call my office.

05:04.555 --> 05:05.920
Yes.

05:06.056 --> 05:09.548
Because wobbly tables don't
just un-wobble themselves.
(DIALING)

05:09.643 --> 05:11.099
(PHONE RINGING)

05:12.897 --> 05:14.228
I need a meeting.

05:15.232 --> 05:16.347
Thanks for fitting me in.

05:16.484 --> 05:19.647
My team has eight urgent,
life-or-death cases

05:19.737 --> 05:21.728
that they've been
waiting for me
to accept or reject.

05:22.406 --> 05:24.317
When is that not true?

05:24.658 --> 05:26.239
Well, right now for one.

05:26.702 --> 05:29.910
But tell my parole board
that I'm taking all eight.

05:30.915 --> 05:31.904
That no one else
can crack them,

05:32.041 --> 05:33.406
that you need me here
for the next five months

05:33.542 --> 05:35.248
or eight people
will die.

05:35.377 --> 05:36.992
You're asking me
to perjure myself.

05:37.087 --> 05:40.671
Just a tiny white lie.
No offence.

05:40.758 --> 05:44.171
Especially since
from what I hear
nothing black is tiny.

05:44.261 --> 05:47.253
Except your penis,
lguess.

05:47.348 --> 05:49.430
You really think
I wanted to cave in
that ceiling?

05:49.517 --> 05:52.509
It was a prank
that went wrong.

05:52.603 --> 05:53.843
Dock my pay, sue me...

05:53.938 --> 05:55.348
Felony vandalism
should've added

05:55.439 --> 05:56.645
another year or two
to your sentence.

05:56.732 --> 05:59.064
It's a miracle
the parole board agreed
to six months.

06:01.362 --> 06:03.728
I will go to jail.
Eventually.

06:05.032 --> 06:08.695
I will pay the price.
I'd just rather
that Wilson didn't.

06:10.496 --> 06:12.282
Come on.
Be a friend.

06:18.254 --> 06:19.460
Okay.
(ELEVATOR DINGS)

06:19.547 --> 06:23.460
But whatever cases you have,
you have to take them all.

06:33.644 --> 06:35.851
"Be a friend"?

06:35.938 --> 06:37.803
How many fingers
am I holding up?

06:38.232 --> 06:39.563
Of course,
you know it's three

06:39.650 --> 06:40.935
because you know
everything I know,

06:41.068 --> 06:43.525
everything
my smack-addled brain
can remember.

06:43.654 --> 06:46.646
Including that
I actually said,
"Be a friend."

06:46.740 --> 06:47.946
My point wasn't
that you said it.

06:48.033 --> 06:50.115
My point was,
once again, why?

06:50.202 --> 06:51.362
I think it's because
part of you knew

06:51.453 --> 06:52.533
you were going
to need a friend.

06:52.746 --> 06:56.159
Part of you knew the plan,
even when it was working,
wouldn't work.

06:57.960 --> 07:00.076
And right now, I'm curious
about why you're sitting
on the ground

07:00.212 --> 07:01.543
instead of heading
for the door.

07:08.137 --> 07:10.503
Guess we've figured out
why you're seeing me,

07:10.848 --> 07:12.679
your suicidal friend.

07:19.690 --> 07:22.557
He'll call you twice a day.
Then his wife will
call you twice a day

07:22.651 --> 07:25.233
to make sure
she understands what
he told her you told him.

07:25.321 --> 07:27.482
Which she won't,
because he didn't.

07:27.573 --> 07:29.154
Maybe you want to
give this one to Connors.

07:29.366 --> 07:30.446
(LAUGHS)
(DOOR OPENS)

07:31.118 --> 07:32.107
Where's House?

07:33.078 --> 07:35.069
Don't know,
don't care, working.

07:40.919 --> 07:42.204
Excuse me.

07:44.506 --> 07:47.043
No one has seen
or heard from him
since two nights ago.

07:47.134 --> 07:48.590
I'm sure he's
enjoying himself.

07:48.677 --> 07:49.712
Last time he went
to prison

07:49.803 --> 07:50.883
he maxed out
his credit cards.

07:50.971 --> 07:55.089
Last time he went to prison,
he thought he had
you waiting for him.

07:55.976 --> 07:58.968
You think
he could have done
something stupid?

08:00.731 --> 08:03.564
I think stupid is
our best-case scenario.

08:04.443 --> 08:06.604
Why do you want
to kill yourself?

08:06.695 --> 08:10.233
Here's a reason.
I can't even get stoned
without some annoying jerk

08:10.324 --> 08:13.031
deciding I need to
be deeply analyzed.

08:14.620 --> 08:17.737
Isn't this
just an incredibly
simple calculation?

08:17.831 --> 08:22.074
I'm going to jail,
losing myjob,
losing my best friend.

08:22.169 --> 08:23.158
Do I need more?

08:23.253 --> 08:25.209
You think
that's the sum total
of who you are?

08:26.924 --> 08:29.711
I'm also
a tremendous baritone.

08:29.802 --> 08:31.212
Now go away.

08:32.513 --> 08:35.255
Even with your subconscious,
you're evasive.

08:38.769 --> 08:41.135
Death's not interesting.

08:41.271 --> 08:43.182
You exist for
what's interesting.

08:43.273 --> 08:46.060
Puzzles, ideas,
analysis.

08:46.151 --> 08:49.359
Death is the opposite
of a cool puzzle.

08:50.280 --> 08:52.271
lt's eternal nothingness.

08:58.288 --> 09:01.451
But you don't find life
interesting anymore.

09:03.168 --> 09:04.954
AMBER: Stop being an idiot.

09:08.799 --> 09:10.130
Can I have
Kutner back, please?

09:10.217 --> 09:11.878
How much pathetic wallowing
do l have to sit through?

09:11.969 --> 09:13.254
How are things in hell?

09:13.345 --> 09:14.801
Is the humidity
the big issue?

09:14.888 --> 09:17.630
What happened next
with the guy's
medical case?

09:19.476 --> 09:21.387
Why?
Exactly.

09:21.478 --> 09:23.309
Why am I, meaning you,

09:23.522 --> 09:25.854
still obsessing
about this case?

09:26.483 --> 09:27.893
Obviously,
we think it's relevant

09:27.985 --> 09:31.728
to why we're still
sitting on the floor
of a burning building.

09:35.200 --> 09:36.235

get even worse.

He'll die before we can
finish the procedure.

off the receptors,

And like it or not,
you are a person.

10:44.645 --> 10:45.851

every one of those...

10:45.938 --> 10:47.269
But not then.
And not like that.

10:47.397 --> 10:48.933
This guy was going nuts
from the naloxone.

10:49.066 --> 10:50.852
He couldn't be rational
if you wanted him to be.

10:50.943 --> 10:53.355
Which you did. Why?

10:53.445 --> 10:54.651
I compressed
the story a little to...

10:54.738 --> 10:55.818
Context matters.

10:56.240 --> 10:58.947
You never talk to patients
for non-diagnostic reasons.

11:19.346 --> 11:20.631

11:20.764 --> 11:22.755
And I was miserable.

11:24.768 --> 11:26.133
You say
you were miserable

11:26.270 --> 11:29.728
because you need
to rationalize
screwing it up.

I mean, I did,

but I'm not miserable.

11:37.656 --> 11:39.146
Not anymore.

11:41.285 --> 11:44.152
I had a ski injury

11:44.288 --> 11:46.529
and painkillers
weren't enough

11:46.623 --> 11:49.615
and a friend of mine
gave me some heroin.

11:54.214 --> 11:57.297

my veins, it was like

11:58.218 --> 12:01.130

or anybody else's.

you lost everything.

he's a good role model?

you wanted to hear.

interesting question,

is why you wanted
to hear it.

13:10.791 --> 13:13.407
Maybe that I was
in the OR the entire day
the ceiling collapsed,

13:13.502 --> 13:16.369
so I couldn't have caused
the plumbing problem.

13:18.173 --> 13:19.913
You set me up.
Not really.

13:20.008 --> 13:22.090
You were going to
basically perjure yourself

13:22.177 --> 13:23.713
so that I could
delay jail time.

13:23.804 --> 13:26.011
Doesn't it make more sense
to actually perjure yourself

13:26.098 --> 13:28.259
so I can actually
avoid jail time?

13:29.518 --> 13:31.429
Why are you doing this?

13:32.479 --> 13:34.310
Why are you risking
destroying yourself?

13:34.398 --> 13:36.559
There is no risk.
I know you.

13:36.733 --> 13:38.598
You'll do
the honest thing.

13:38.694 --> 13:40.104
You'll lie.

13:47.285 --> 13:48.365
No.

13:51.206 --> 13:53.037
(DOOR OPENS)

13:54.167 --> 13:56.078
(DOOR CLOSES)

14:01.925 --> 14:04.086
He's happy.

14:04.177 --> 14:05.963
He's dead.

14:09.975 --> 14:11.761
You weren't worried.

14:11.852 --> 14:14.343
Of course I was worried.
My plan fell through.

14:14.438 --> 14:17.396
The plan didn't matter.
Your plan to replace
that plan didn't matter.

14:18.150 --> 14:20.391
Wilson didn't matter,
jail didn't matter,

14:20.819 --> 14:21.899
the only thing
that mattered,

14:21.987 --> 14:25.445
the only thing
that ever mattered,
was the puzzle.

14:31.913 --> 14:35.326
I noticed a slight twitch
in his thenar eminence.

14:36.251 --> 14:37.411
Which meant...

14:37.502 --> 14:38.878
You're dying.

14:40.547 --> 14:42.333
Because my thumb
is a little shaky?

14:42.966 --> 14:44.172
Plus the thinning
of the muscle.

14:44.259 --> 14:46.420
Plus that speech you gave
at Yankee Stadium

14:46.511 --> 14:49.298
saying you were
the luckiest man
on the face of the earth.

14:49.973 --> 14:52.009
Add them up,
it means ALS.

14:53.769 --> 14:54.929
Lou Gehrig's disease?

14:55.687 --> 14:57.803
You're trapped in your body.
You can't move or speak

14:58.774 --> 15:00.230
while you just die?

15:00.317 --> 15:01.477
If it makes you
feel any better,

15:01.568 --> 15:04.105
at this rate,
it'll be fast.

15:10.702 --> 15:12.863
You're not symmetrical.

15:12.954 --> 15:13.943
AMBER: Wait.

15:14.039 --> 15:15.199
Now you're standing
at the door.

15:15.290 --> 15:16.370
What happened
in the meantime?

15:16.541 --> 15:19.908
And lo, there was
a miraculous wonder.
I walked across the room...

15:20.003 --> 15:23.040
No, you just
skipped over a chunk
of conversation.

15:23.131 --> 15:25.622
He swore that
he'd live a better,
more selfless life

15:25.717 --> 15:27.423
in his remaining time,
blah, blah, blah.

15:27.511 --> 15:30.719
After two blahs,
I'd heard enough
and I moved to the door.

15:30.806 --> 15:32.762
No. You're avoiding it.

15:34.643 --> 15:36.349
Do you smell smoke?

15:37.771 --> 15:39.136
Fair enough.

15:39.731 --> 15:41.642
You're not symmetrical.

15:44.402 --> 15:46.984
The veins
on your right side
are distended.

15:47.072 --> 15:48.061
What does that mean?

15:48.156 --> 15:50.943
There's a bulge
in your supraclavicular notch.

15:51.159 --> 15:52.194
There's something
in there.

15:52.285 --> 15:53.274
What?

15:54.204 --> 15:56.286
I'm not
that good a doctor.

16:10.220 --> 16:12.006
Good news.

16:12.097 --> 16:13.587
Your case
is fascinating.

16:14.266 --> 16:15.506
And good news for you,

16:17.519 --> 16:19.760
Youâ€™ve inhaled
a small branch,

16:19.896 --> 16:22.478
probably while
you were realizing
that itâ€™s all worth it

16:22.566 --> 16:24.602
while you were passed out
on a park bench.

16:24.818 --> 16:26.979
Anyone else would
have coughed it up,
but â€™cause youâ€™re a junkie,

16:27.070 --> 16:28.901
your cough reflex
is suppressed.

16:28.989 --> 16:30.069
OLIVER: And it grew?

16:30.157 --> 16:32.113
HOUSE: Not unless
you also inhaled
a chunk of the sun

16:32.200 --> 16:35.112
and a drip-irrigation
system, you idiot.

16:35.203 --> 16:39.287
lt set off
an autoimmune reaction which,
and I canâ€™t help saying this,

16:39.374 --> 16:41.615
was the root of
all your problems.

16:44.337 --> 16:45.838
AMBER: You're smiling.

16:48.175 --> 16:50.382
Iwas, and now I'm not.

16:51.970 --> 16:54.006
Because a moment's
fun a few days ago

16:54.097 --> 16:55.758
does not trump
a friend dying.

16:55.849 --> 16:57.180
Yeah, it does, you idiot.

16:58.185 --> 16:59.516
Because after he's dead
you cry for a while

16:59.603 --> 17:01.764
and then you go back
to doing what you love.

17:03.106 --> 17:05.392
Every patient I've had,

17:05.483 --> 17:09.021
in 70 years from now,
they'll all be
as dead as Wilson.

17:09.112 --> 17:11.273
Everybody dies.
It's meaningless.

17:11.448 --> 17:12.654
When you solve a puzzle,

17:13.408 --> 17:16.821
the world makes sense
and everything feels right.

17:16.912 --> 17:18.527
And you'll always
have another one,

17:18.622 --> 17:20.988
because people
will always get sick.

17:21.082 --> 17:22.868
It's shallow and
it's insignificant,

17:22.959 --> 17:24.790
but if you don't give
a damn if idiots live,

17:24.878 --> 17:28.086
why would you
possibly give a damn
about shallowness?

17:28.882 --> 17:30.622
It makes you happy.

17:31.760 --> 17:34.467
And why would you
need more than that?

17:35.680 --> 17:37.011
Go home.

18:16.805 --> 18:18.011
Foreman.

18:19.432 --> 18:22.174
House would never
leave food out here
rotting for days.

18:22.310 --> 18:24.642
His suitcases are
in his closet.

18:27.023 --> 18:28.604
Ifwe had handled
this differently...

18:28.692 --> 18:30.603
We did the right thing.

18:32.362 --> 18:34.193
(CELL PHONE RINGING)

18:40.829 --> 18:41.818
Hello?

18:44.833 --> 18:46.869
I'll let
his accountant know.

18:46.960 --> 18:48.541
House no-showed
on a hooker
two nights ago.

18:50.297 --> 18:51.787
Outgoing calls.

18:53.842 --> 18:55.048

18:56.386 --> 18:58.342
Me. I didn't pick up.

18:59.055 --> 19:00.795
The Chinese place...

19:01.308 --> 19:02.844
Wait, wait, wait.
Who's that?

19:03.059 --> 19:04.799
He called four times.

19:04.894 --> 19:05.883
I don't know.

19:17.741 --> 19:18.947

20:01.785 --> 20:02.945
(GROANS)

20:17.884 --> 20:21.376
It's a total disaster.
Do you have any idea
how hard it is

20:21.471 --> 20:24.679
to schedule
a cable appointment
with the hours that I work?

20:24.808 --> 20:26.764
House has been
missing for two days,
we know he talked to you.

20:26.851 --> 20:28.887
WILSON:
Anything you can tell us
about his mental state,

20:28.978 --> 20:30.593
or where he was headed,
anything at all...

20:30.688 --> 20:33.225
Would be a breach
of confidentiality
and a violation of the law.

20:33.316 --> 20:35.682
Not if he's
a danger to himself
or someone else.

20:37.529 --> 20:39.861
Is this coming out
of our 50 minutes?

20:39.989 --> 20:41.274
Is this your
douchebag group?

20:41.658 --> 20:43.148
Excuse me.

20:48.456 --> 20:49.616
What makes you think
he's a danger to himself?

20:49.707 --> 20:51.413
He hasn't been home,
but he didn't take
anything with him,

20:51.501 --> 20:53.287
not even his cell.

20:55.171 --> 20:56.331
You're not
saying anything,

20:56.423 --> 20:58.459
which means
he didn't specifically
mention suicide.

20:58.550 --> 21:00.086
But you came out here
to talk to us,

21:00.176 --> 21:03.168
so he must've
said something
that worries you.

21:04.514 --> 21:07.301
There are other ways
of reaching oblivion.

21:07.392 --> 21:08.677
Vicodin?
He always
has his Vicodin,

21:08.810 --> 21:11.347
there's no reason
to call a shrink...

21:11.479 --> 21:12.889
His last patient
was a heroin addict.

21:16.484 --> 21:18.065
So I guess
we're all done here.

21:19.487 --> 21:21.352
The guy's address has
gotta be in the file.

21:25.368 --> 21:26.483
STACY: What about God?

21:28.872 --> 21:30.578
You were leaving,
and then you stopped.

21:31.708 --> 21:32.948
VVhy?

21:33.042 --> 21:36.580
Your theory is
I'm not leaving because
I believe in God?

21:37.213 --> 21:38.464
What?
He's calling me home?

21:38.548 --> 21:41.039
Maybe falling through
that floor was a sign.

21:41.176 --> 21:43.337
Maybe that the universe
hates you. Something.

21:45.430 --> 21:47.421
You really don't believe?

21:48.224 --> 21:51.307
Really,
not in some deep crack
of some remote recess

21:51.394 --> 21:53.806
of some dark corner
of your mind?

21:53.897 --> 21:55.228
No.

21:56.065 --> 21:58.772
Except that some deep crack
of some remote recess

21:58.902 --> 22:00.813
of some dark corner
is here telling me...

22:00.904 --> 22:01.859
That's enough.

22:01.946 --> 22:05.530
In a burning building,
facing imminent death,
that's more than enough.

22:06.034 --> 22:07.695
Pascal's wager
is facile.

22:07.785 --> 22:10.037
Saying it's facile
is facile.

22:11.456 --> 22:12.866
Why is it wrong?

22:14.542 --> 22:16.123
Don't be logical.
Be desperate.

22:16.586 --> 22:19.419
You've gotta
have something
to hold on to.

22:20.715 --> 22:23.548
But you can't live your life
based on something
you don't believe.

22:23.635 --> 22:27.548
But you could end your life
based on something
you don't believe?

22:27.639 --> 22:28.879
What about love?

22:29.891 --> 22:33.258
I lived with you for years.
I know you believe in love.

22:37.315 --> 22:39.397
Foreman
wouldn't help me.

22:40.443 --> 22:43.560
Which means I need you
to take the fall.

22:44.614 --> 22:46.229
You do remember
I'm dying, right?

22:46.324 --> 22:49.282
Which is why you'll
never spend a day
in jail.

22:49.786 --> 22:52.152
Fresh-faced,
cancer-ridden.

22:52.247 --> 22:53.828
It's tough to do both,
but you pull it off.

22:53.957 --> 22:55.572
Your fingerprints
are all over
those hockey tickets.

22:55.667 --> 22:58.124
I never admitted to
flushing anything.

22:58.253 --> 23:01.541
My prints make sense
if I gave those
tickets to you,

23:01.631 --> 23:03.121
as an incentive
to stay alive.

23:03.841 --> 23:06.298
And I was so angry
that you didn't
respect my dying wishes,

23:06.386 --> 23:08.502
I took thousands of
dollars of season tickets

23:08.596 --> 23:09.881
and flushed them
down toilets?

23:09.973 --> 23:12.806
All you have to do
is create reasonable doubt.

23:12.892 --> 23:14.393
Great. What if I do
more than that?

23:14.477 --> 23:15.637
What if I end up
in jail?

23:15.728 --> 23:19.220
Or spending my final months
in endless hearings?

23:20.858 --> 23:23.565
That's a risk
you're willing to take.

23:25.405 --> 23:28.613
I have a reputation,
I have a legacy
that could...

23:28.700 --> 23:30.156
Wilson.

23:32.829 --> 23:35.536
I don't want to lose
this time with you.

23:45.508 --> 23:46.668
Okay.

23:50.888 --> 23:52.173
Thanks.

23:53.182 --> 23:54.763
I knew
I could count on you.

24:00.023 --> 24:01.354
Wait! Wait!

24:04.235 --> 24:06.191
You want the fries back?

24:08.906 --> 24:11.113
I'm not
gonna take the fall.

24:17.373 --> 24:18.533
Don't do this
to me, Wilson.

24:20.543 --> 24:22.329
It's our only option.
Exactly.

24:22.420 --> 24:24.661
Because you overplayed
your hand with Foreman.

24:24.756 --> 24:27.748
Because you knew
you had me as a backstop.

24:27.884 --> 24:30.717
Even with me dying,
you just assumed

24:30.803 --> 24:31.883
I'd be here
to bail you out.

24:32.722 --> 24:34.838
Since you are here,
and you are bailing me out,

24:34.932 --> 24:37.423
seems like
a pretty safe assumption.

24:38.895 --> 24:40.055
Hey!

24:41.814 --> 24:43.645
I won't be here soon.

24:43.733 --> 24:45.519
If I do this,
I'm teaching you

24:45.610 --> 24:47.692
that your bad behavior
will always be rewarded.

24:47.779 --> 24:49.019
You need to learn...

24:49.113 --> 24:50.978
How to act
when you're gone?

24:51.074 --> 24:53.656
If that's the lesson,
we've a really great
opportunity coming up.

24:53.743 --> 24:55.950
You'll just try to
find someone else,
and it won't work,

24:56.079 --> 24:57.159
and it shouldn't work.

24:57.246 --> 24:59.453
So that's the great wisdom
you're imparting?

24:59.582 --> 25:00.947
That I'll always
be alone?

25:01.084 --> 25:04.247
There's only one person
you can count on.

25:07.840 --> 25:09.796
I thought there were two.

25:12.804 --> 25:14.510
I need to do this.

25:15.598 --> 25:16.804
For you.

25:27.485 --> 25:28.600
Wilson's right.

25:28.945 --> 25:31.937
He's always right.
He's always been
your good side.

25:32.448 --> 25:35.360
I always wondered
why I photographed
so poorly.

25:36.369 --> 25:38.030
And because he's
always played that role,

25:38.121 --> 25:40.453
you've never had to
develop a conscience
of your own.

25:41.666 --> 25:45.705
People don't change.
Consciences don't
spontaneously develop.

25:47.964 --> 25:49.670
You're wrong, Greg.

25:50.967 --> 25:54.459
Which is why you'll be
better off without him.

25:57.640 --> 26:02.134
You've been looking to him
to find what you've gotta
find within yourself.

26:05.356 --> 26:07.597
Something you can find.

26:24.751 --> 26:26.366
Hold your child.

26:44.604 --> 26:46.595
This is a reason to die.

26:48.399 --> 26:51.141
This is what my life
could have been,
not what it can be.

26:51.235 --> 26:52.486
If it could have been,

26:52.695 --> 26:54.731
you're capable
of it now.

26:57.450 --> 26:59.816
You're married,
Cuddy's gone.

26:59.911 --> 27:02.573
We aren't
the only two people
who could love you.

27:12.089 --> 27:14.080
Why settle so easily?

27:17.845 --> 27:20.928
These are just
idiotic fantasies.

27:21.974 --> 27:22.963
Greg, don't.

27:24.060 --> 27:27.268
At odds with every
logical bone in my body.

27:27.355 --> 27:28.595
Get up.

27:29.190 --> 27:31.727
You do not have
to die in here!

27:46.499 --> 27:48.035
IS this hell?

27:48.918 --> 27:51.660
An eternity of people
trying to convince me
to live?

27:56.968 --> 27:59.835
Who says I'm here to
convince you to live?

28:06.561 --> 28:08.392
You're the last one
I thought would hate me.

28:08.479 --> 28:09.685
I don't hate you.

28:10.731 --> 28:12.107
I love you.

28:14.318 --> 28:16.058
And yet you think
I deserve to die.

28:16.737 --> 28:19.524
But not as a punishment.

28:19.615 --> 28:20.991
As a reward.

28:23.452 --> 28:24.908
lthink

28:25.580 --> 28:27.696
you've suffered enough.

28:27.874 --> 28:29.580
You've given enough.

28:29.667 --> 28:33.455
I think you deserve
a chance to just

28:36.132 --> 28:37.622
give up.

28:40.928 --> 28:42.088
Like Wilson did?

28:42.305 --> 28:44.170
Like Wilson did.

28:44.307 --> 28:48.550
You accepted his choice
that ending the pain
is better than the pain.

28:51.314 --> 28:54.021
Why can't you give
yourself that gift?

29:05.411 --> 29:07.026
This is the address
House's patient gave?

29:08.664 --> 29:10.245
Everybody lies.

29:13.878 --> 29:15.709
Do you smell smoke?

29:29.518 --> 29:31.645

Just let go.

29:39.695 --> 29:41.401
Just go to sleep.

29:46.661 --> 29:49.528
I had a chance
to avoid this.

29:49.622 --> 29:52.705
You had many chances,
and you blew them all up.

29:55.127 --> 29:56.788
No, this was different.

29:57.171 --> 30:00.629
They're all different.
But the reasons
are all the same.

30:00.716 --> 30:03.378
You're arrogant.
You're self-destructive.

30:03.803 --> 30:07.011
You only care
about yourself.

30:07.598 --> 30:10.010
That moment
with the patient.

30:11.894 --> 30:14.727
That chunk of conversation
I skipped over.

30:17.775 --> 30:19.731
I told him he was dying.

30:20.069 --> 30:21.309
If it makes you
feel any better,

30:21.404 --> 30:23.861
at this rate,
it'll be fast.

30:32.123 --> 30:33.863
Let me take the fall.

30:36.711 --> 30:38.702
For you.
For that prank.

30:43.342 --> 30:44.377
You don't
owe me anything.

30:44.510 --> 30:45.499
You tried to save me.

30:45.594 --> 30:48.722
I failed.
Motives don't matter.
Only actions.

30:48.806 --> 30:50.637
Trying is an action.

30:50.766 --> 30:53.052
Why are you trying to
talk me out of this?

30:53.644 --> 30:57.432
You just fake the records,
you say I came into
the clinic last week.

30:57.523 --> 30:59.684
I'll tell the cops
you treated me like crap.

30:59.942 --> 31:02.809
So I stole your tickets
and flushed them.

31:08.993 --> 31:10.324
Thank you.

31:24.300 --> 31:26.256
And you're doing this
because you're dying?

31:26.343 --> 31:28.834
I'm doing this
because I have
nothing left to lose.

31:32.808 --> 31:35.299
So when you were living,
you did nothing for anyone
and didn't care.

31:35.394 --> 31:40.263
Now that you're dying,
you're willing to
help a virtual stranger.

31:40.357 --> 31:44.475
Which means you're
a better person dying
than you ever were living.

31:45.404 --> 31:48.988
And the world's a better place
because I didn't save you.

31:52.495 --> 31:55.783
Which makes me wonder
why I'm about to tell you,

31:57.625 --> 31:59.490
you're not symmetrical.

31:59.627 --> 32:01.583
What's your point?

32:01.670 --> 32:04.457
That you cared about him
more than you cared
about yourself?

32:05.466 --> 32:09.334
You cared about the puzzle
more than you cared
about yourself.

32:10.971 --> 32:14.589
If I kept it to myself,
then it would
just be a puzzle.

32:15.768 --> 32:17.929
But I opened my mouth
because I thought
it was more.

32:18.020 --> 32:19.931
You know it's the same
or you wouldn't be
bickering with me

32:20.022 --> 32:21.353
while the flames lick
at your feet.

32:21.690 --> 32:23.191
You're afraid
of this decision,

32:23.275 --> 32:25.982
and you are trying to argue
until fate takes it
out of your hands.

32:27.822 --> 32:30.279
You're taking
the cowardly way out.

32:31.033 --> 32:33.695
And worse,

32:33.786 --> 32:38.029
you're too cowardly
to even admit you're taking
the cowardly way out.

32:45.047 --> 32:46.548
You're right.

32:47.842 --> 32:49.503

no one else would.

35:23.706 --> 35:25.822
He got me fired.

35:26.542 --> 35:28.328
He gave me the guts

He was willing to kill me.

be grateful.

...but somewhere in there,

36:25.017 --> 36:26.848
he knew how to love.

36:32.107 --> 36:33.608
He was my friend.

you have to remember,

36:40.449 --> 36:42.030
the thing
you can't forget,

36:42.201 --> 36:45.568
is that Gregory House
saved lives.

36:47.790 --> 36:51.624
He was a healer,
and in the end...

37:02.221 --> 37:03.552
House was an ass.

37:06.809 --> 37:08.970
He mocked anyone.

up to his insane ideals
of integrity.

He claimed to be
on some heroic quest
for truth.

37:18.445 --> 37:20.777
But the truth is
he was a bitterjerk

37:20.864 --> 37:22.320
who liked making
people miserable.

37:22.491 --> 37:25.654
And he proved that
by dying selfishly,

numbed by narcotics,
without a thought
ofanyone.
