03:49.562 --> 03:51.698
You're sweating.

03:51.698 --> 03:54.667
I know. I'm excited though.
I can see it all happening.

03:58.571 --> 04:00.039
A little turn...

04:00.039 --> 04:02.269
Now side to side.

04:03.843 --> 04:05.470
Other people can sing.

04:19.826 --> 04:21.194
Can we talk out here
for a minute?

04:21.194 --> 04:22.195
She's fantastic.

04:22.195 --> 04:23.129
What are you
talking about?

04:23.129 --> 04:24.931
I think she sings funny.

04:24.931 --> 04:27.166
And her dancing's not
all that great either.

04:27.166 --> 04:28.997
That's the first time
she did it, okay?

04:31.804 --> 04:33.973
Yeah, but I had
all the kits by then.

04:33.973 --> 04:35.208
Because she didn't
take the kettle,

04:35.208 --> 04:36.809
so I was stuck.

04:36.809 --> 04:38.444
Do you want me to
take the kettle, Samuel?

04:38.444 --> 04:40.313
No, I don't.
I just want Kathy

04:40.313 --> 04:43.049
to put it over here.
This is, you know...

04:43.049 --> 04:44.851
If you say these words,
and then, boom,

04:44.851 --> 04:46.152
you just put
your hands out,

04:46.152 --> 04:47.585
and there they are.
They're there.

04:51.391 --> 04:53.586
Please don't
drop the props, Kathy.

05:01.534 --> 05:02.735
Wait, wait.

05:02.735 --> 05:04.137
Why are you putting it
on her head, though?

05:04.137 --> 05:05.905
I'm a little confused.

05:05.905 --> 05:07.840
I don't know.
It was, uh...

05:07.840 --> 05:09.676
Because she's not
going to pick it up.

05:09.676 --> 05:11.511
It looks like
you're trying to...

05:11.511 --> 05:13.279
put a hat on her head
or something.

05:13.279 --> 05:14.847
You're fantastic.

05:14.847 --> 05:17.083
You just have to listen
to your heart, Cvalda.

05:17.083 --> 05:18.951
I don't want you
to call me Cvalda.

05:18.951 --> 05:20.386
Okay, Paul, please.

05:20.386 --> 05:21.854
You're Cvalda
to me.

05:21.854 --> 05:23.788
Let's do some sound effects.

05:50.616 --> 05:51.851
Wait!

05:51.851 --> 05:53.152
I told you
no tapping

05:53.152 --> 05:54.487
in "The Sound
of Music."

05:54.487 --> 05:56.389
It really needs rhythm.

05:56.389 --> 05:57.757
Like drums or something.

05:57.757 --> 06:02.128
Everybody’s
doing a great job.

06:02.128 --> 06:03.618
Really.

06:13.339 --> 06:17.139
"L-T-U..."

06:20.947 --> 06:22.548
Oh, hello, Selma.
Come here.

06:22.548 --> 06:24.384
- Are you ready?
- Yeah, I'm ready.

06:24.384 --> 06:26.819
Okay, you know
where to stand.

06:26.819 --> 06:27.887
Yeah.

06:27.887 --> 06:30.523
So let's try
this one.

06:30.523 --> 06:33.393
"F-E-Z-T."

06:33.393 --> 06:34.994
Maybe
even this one.

06:34.994 --> 06:38.798
"T-E-F-P-O..."

06:38.798 --> 06:41.667
I think you can work
that machine safely.

06:41.667 --> 06:43.736
I'll write a note
to the plant

06:43.736 --> 06:44.971
and let them know.

06:44.971 --> 06:46.873
Thank you.

06:46.873 --> 06:47.974
Bye.

06:47.974 --> 06:49.175
Goodbye.

06:49.175 --> 06:50.243
Bye.

06:50.243 --> 06:51.301
Goodbye.

07:20.440 --> 07:22.575
We lost five hours
'cause some idiot

07:22.575 --> 07:23.701
broke the machine.

07:25.745 --> 07:27.613
Bill's here.

07:27.613 --> 07:29.615
So?

07:29.615 --> 07:31.784
Well, he's here
with Gene.

07:31.784 --> 07:34.654
Oh, that sounds
like bad news.

07:34.654 --> 07:37.156
What are you
going to do?

07:37.156 --> 07:40.148
Well, I guess I got
to tell her, don't I?

07:44.931 --> 07:47.467
You can't bring
the script to work, Selma.

07:47.467 --> 07:49.969
Keep your eyes
on the machine, okay?

07:49.969 --> 07:51.561
Yeah.

07:52.605 --> 07:54.072
Sure.

07:57.410 --> 07:58.878
Bill's here.

07:58.878 --> 08:00.213
Bill?

08:00.213 --> 08:02.340
He's here with Gene.

08:06.152 --> 08:08.120
Not again!

08:08.120 --> 08:09.951
You got to come
right back, okay?

08:16.929 --> 08:19.198
Don't be too worried.

08:19.198 --> 08:20.833
We're gonna work this out.

08:20.833 --> 08:22.164
Here she comes.

08:28.107 --> 08:30.877
Why are you
not in school?!

08:30.877 --> 08:32.410
Uhh...

08:32.410 --> 08:35.615
When I say so,
you go to school!

08:35.615 --> 08:36.849
Do you think I joke?

08:36.849 --> 08:38.451
You have to study!

08:38.451 --> 08:42.121
Come on, Selma, stop.

08:42.121 --> 08:45.291
We talked about this.
Didn't we talk about it?

08:45.291 --> 08:48.461
Hanging out with those
automobile thieves.

08:48.461 --> 08:49.228
So what?

08:49.228 --> 08:50.963
He's learning.

08:50.963 --> 08:52.465
Selma,
he's learning.

08:52.465 --> 08:53.633
Aw, come on.

08:53.633 --> 08:56.669
Gene, this is the most
important thing.

08:56.669 --> 08:58.569
You have to go to school.

08:59.939 --> 09:01.874
Selma, l... I can...

09:01.874 --> 09:03.643
drive him back to school
if you like.

09:03.643 --> 09:05.444
Since when was that
your business?

09:05.444 --> 09:06.679
What you doing here?

09:06.679 --> 09:08.581
If you need
a ride home...

09:08.581 --> 09:10.082
I don't
even punch out

09:10.082 --> 09:12.184
until after
another two hours.

09:12.184 --> 09:14.220
Sometimes you punch out
around this time.

09:14.220 --> 09:15.955
I never punch out early!

09:15.955 --> 09:17.547
Don't need a dumb...

09:19.025 --> 09:20.927
Don't need a ride!

09:20.927 --> 09:22.662
In your little head.

09:22.662 --> 09:23.829
All right.

09:23.829 --> 09:26.059
Come on, Mr. G.
Let's get you to school.

09:46.452 --> 09:48.521
Thank you, but I...

09:48.521 --> 09:52.124
I'll just...
I'll just ride my bike.

09:52.124 --> 09:53.523
Bye, Jeff.

09:57.263 --> 09:59.365
She likes you.

09:59.365 --> 10:01.801
I'm sure of it.

10:01.801 --> 10:03.169
You're sure?

10:03.169 --> 10:05.069
Yeah, I'm sure of it.

10:08.074 --> 10:09.809
This is my punishment,

10:09.809 --> 10:12.645
that you help me with this.

10:12.645 --> 10:15.113
And you've got...

10:16.349 --> 10:19.011
You've got to make
your bed as well.

10:20.553 --> 10:23.589
And you forgot
to wrap up the bread.

10:23.589 --> 10:25.079
Two times.

10:26.092 --> 10:28.127
There's no more of that.

10:28.127 --> 10:29.856
You keep reading.

10:30.863 --> 10:32.865
"So long, farewell,

10:32.865 --> 10:35.668
auf... wiedersehen...

10:35.668 --> 10:38.871
adieu, adieu, adieu,

10:38.871 --> 10:40.896
to yieu and yieu and yieu."

10:42.842 --> 10:44.076
"To yieu...

10:44.076 --> 10:46.178
and yieu..."

10:46.178 --> 10:48.781
What does that mean,

10:48.781 --> 10:49.748
"yieu"?

10:51.484 --> 10:53.486
It's your dumb musical.

10:53.486 --> 10:54.851
"And yieu..."

10:55.988 --> 10:57.546
It's German.

10:58.724 --> 11:01.124
- You think?
- Mm.

11:08.034 --> 11:09.669
You want
some more ketchup?

11:09.669 --> 11:11.000
No.

11:18.511 --> 11:20.376
Are you tired?

11:25.217 --> 11:27.653
Why... why should you...

11:27.653 --> 11:29.855
always ask me so...

11:29.855 --> 11:32.289
so stupid questions?

11:36.162 --> 11:37.652
Shall I show you
my step?

11:49.175 --> 11:52.945
Oh, hi.
Hi, Gene.

11:52.945 --> 11:54.747
How's the dancing?

11:54.747 --> 11:56.982
Oh... good.

11:56.982 --> 11:58.718
- Yeah?
- Yeah, Yeah.

11:58.718 --> 12:01.053
You want to come over
to me and Bill's place

12:01.053 --> 12:02.418
and listen
to some music?

12:03.889 --> 12:06.659
That... that
would be lovely.

12:06.659 --> 12:07.960
But... we couldn't.

12:07.960 --> 12:09.895
Come on.
Come on.

12:09.895 --> 12:12.431
Yeah... uh...

12:12.431 --> 12:14.262
Let's go.
Come on.

12:23.008 --> 12:25.511
You should ask Bill
about his money.

12:25.511 --> 12:28.708
Linda likes it when
we talk about that.

12:30.716 --> 12:33.085
You're doing
a very n ice job with these.

12:33.085 --> 12:35.521
How about that?

12:35.521 --> 12:37.189
You have to be
very careful

12:37.189 --> 12:39.191
not to bend
the card.

12:39.191 --> 12:40.226
Uh-h uh.

12:40.226 --> 12:43.662
Otherwise I don't
get paid for it.

12:43.662 --> 12:45.197
No.

12:45.197 --> 12:47.133
That's fair,
because...

12:47.133 --> 12:50.136
the people in the shops
would never want to buy it

12:50.136 --> 12:51.337
if it's bent.

12:51.337 --> 12:53.038
You wouldn't buy it
if it was bent.

12:53.038 --> 12:54.039
That's true,
I wouldn't.

12:54.039 --> 12:55.836
Wouldn't buy anything
if it was bent.

13:04.116 --> 13:06.519
In Czechoslovakia,

13:06.519 --> 13:07.753
I saw a film,

13:07.753 --> 13:11.323
and they were eating candy
from a tin

13:11.323 --> 13:12.324
just like this.

13:12.324 --> 13:14.193
No.

13:14.193 --> 13:15.961
I thought to myself...

13:15.961 --> 13:19.064
how wonderful it must be

13:19.064 --> 13:21.600
in the United States.

13:21.600 --> 13:23.169
Yeah?

13:23.169 --> 13:25.004
You think my house
looks like a movie?

13:25.004 --> 13:26.939
Oh, our house
looks like a movie.

13:26.939 --> 13:28.839
And you look
like a movie star.

13:31.377 --> 13:33.345
Bill gives me
a lot of money.

13:33.345 --> 13:34.680
You know?

13:34.680 --> 13:35.848
I know.

13:35.848 --> 13:37.716
Of course, it's all
that money you inherited,

13:37.716 --> 13:39.985
Isn’t it, Bill?

13:39.985 --> 13:41.316
That's right.

13:44.890 --> 13:46.258
Hey, Selma...

13:46.258 --> 13:47.919
Take the rest
with you.

13:49.361 --> 13:50.629
Are you sure?

13:50.629 --> 13:52.256
Go on.

15:07.740 --> 15:09.341
Hello.

15:09.341 --> 15:11.543
Good morning.

15:11.543 --> 15:12.978
I've got the rent.

15:12.978 --> 15:14.446
Oh.

15:14.446 --> 15:16.482
You always pay
right on time.

15:16.482 --> 15:18.984
Don't worry about Gene.
I’ll get him off to school,

15:18.984 --> 15:19.985
okay?

15:19.985 --> 15:20.986
Thank you.

15:20.986 --> 15:22.254
Thanks very much.

15:22.254 --> 15:25.557
Remember your bag.

15:25.557 --> 15:26.792
Bye-bye.

15:26.792 --> 15:27.884
Bye.

15:29.628 --> 15:32.364
I think you're always
so serious, Kathy.

15:32.364 --> 15:34.389
Aw... again we start.

15:35.534 --> 15:38.404
I don't think inside
you're serious at all.

15:38.404 --> 15:40.239
I don't know.

15:40.239 --> 15:42.007
Not always.

15:42.007 --> 15:43.008
Cvalda.

15:43.008 --> 15:45.044
Why do you
call me that?

15:45.044 --> 15:47.672
It's like...
someone who's...

15:49.581 --> 15:52.184
I don't know,
just big and happy.

15:52.184 --> 15:53.786
I am not that big.

15:53.786 --> 15:56.322
Happy?
I don't know.

15:56.322 --> 15:58.381
Just need someone
to pull it out.

16:05.097 --> 16:06.398
Beautiful eyes.

16:06.398 --> 16:07.399
Yeah.

16:07.399 --> 16:09.526
But he's not
real happy, is he?

16:11.136 --> 16:13.127
How is she doing?

16:14.340 --> 16:15.975
It's when she
can not keep up,

16:15.975 --> 16:18.777
and she's going to faint.

16:18.777 --> 16:19.979
Ah, she fainted.

16:19.979 --> 16:21.447
Please be quiet.

16:21.447 --> 16:22.581
Oh, give us a break.

16:22.581 --> 16:23.949
She doesn't see
that well.

16:23.949 --> 16:25.718
I paid good money
to see this film.

16:25.718 --> 16:26.912
Well, so did she.

16:30.189 --> 16:32.124
I love it
when they dance.

16:32.124 --> 16:33.959
for Pete's sake,
it's a musical.

16:33.959 --> 16:35.461
Of course they're dancing!

16:35.461 --> 16:36.395
We know that!

16:36.395 --> 16:37.663
Oh, you're so smart.

16:37.663 --> 16:39.028
- Yes.
- Oh.

16:41.066 --> 16:43.193
I think you made
friends, Kathy.

16:49.274 --> 16:50.741
Stop!

17:00.686 --> 17:02.821
So, what'd she say?

17:02.821 --> 17:03.822
What?

17:03.822 --> 17:05.290
What did she say?

17:05.290 --> 17:07.526
She didn't say
anything.

17:07.526 --> 17:09.391
Are you trying to
tell me something?

17:10.396 --> 17:12.564
It's about the bike.

17:12.564 --> 17:13.832
The bike?

17:13.832 --> 17:16.702
Mm, the bike.

17:16.702 --> 17:18.137
Oh, um, I... I...

17:18.137 --> 17:20.506
I can not
give Gene a bike.

17:20.506 --> 17:21.807
Is this his idea?

17:21.807 --> 17:23.575
No, it's not his idea.

17:23.575 --> 17:24.576
Gene?

17:24.576 --> 17:25.944
Yeah?

17:25.944 --> 17:28.047
Did you ask them
to come over?

17:28.047 --> 17:29.681
No.

17:29.681 --> 17:31.250
No, he didn't.
It doesn't...

17:31.250 --> 17:33.619
He doesn't know anything,
Selma. Frankly.

17:33.619 --> 17:35.554
Why, have I
done something?

17:35.554 --> 17:36.755
No.

17:36.755 --> 17:38.157
I haven't got
the money.

17:38.157 --> 17:41.427
But... I'm almost
the only k id in class

17:41.427 --> 17:42.985
who doesn't have
a bike.

17:44.096 --> 17:46.932
I even know a boy
who's got a scooter.

17:46.932 --> 17:49.162
You know I haven't got
any money.

17:50.202 --> 17:51.770
The only extra money I got

17:51.770 --> 17:53.772
the times I managed
to save up,

17:53.772 --> 17:54.873
I send it...

17:54.873 --> 17:56.075
to Grandpa.

17:56.075 --> 17:57.476
- Come have a look.
- I'm not gonna get you

17:57.476 --> 17:58.477
expensive things.

17:58.477 --> 17:59.778
Your mother
is only teasing.

17:59.778 --> 18:02.047
Look what she's
brought for you!

18:02.047 --> 18:04.016
It's a bike!

18:04.016 --> 18:05.084
We can not
accept that.

18:05.084 --> 18:06.819
Selma, it was second-hand.

18:06.819 --> 18:09.254
I can't give him
any expensive things.

18:09.254 --> 18:10.489
- Yeah, but...
- I can't even give it

18:10.489 --> 18:11.924
for his birthday.

18:11.924 --> 18:13.992
- Yeah, but, well...
- He's just gonna accept that.

18:13.992 --> 18:15.494
I'm not that sort of mom.

18:15.494 --> 18:16.962
I'm... I'm...

18:16.962 --> 18:20.532
I'm just not that kind
of mother, Gene. I...

18:20.532 --> 18:22.067
Can't you be

18:22.067 --> 18:24.169
that kind of a mother?

18:24.169 --> 18:26.205
It's not exactly a scooter.

18:26.205 --> 18:29.341
Hmm... We’ll see.

18:29.341 --> 18:30.676
We’ll see.

18:30.676 --> 18:31.777
Careful!

18:31.777 --> 18:33.745
Don't ride
too fast.

18:36.682 --> 18:38.206
Hey, gene,
bring it over here.

18:42.354 --> 18:43.989
He looks very happy,
doesn't he?

18:43.989 --> 18:44.921
He does look happy.

18:46.291 --> 18:48.026
Here he comes again.

18:48.026 --> 18:49.061
Attention!

18:49.061 --> 18:50.429
Bring it over here.

18:50.429 --> 18:51.630
Mom...

18:51.630 --> 18:54.600
Okay.

18:54.600 --> 18:56.568
Did you hear
what she said?

18:56.568 --> 18:59.505
- She say okay?
- Yeah!

18:59.505 --> 19:00.939
Did you say okay?

19:00.939 --> 19:02.531
Yeah.

19:03.609 --> 19:05.344
Promise to go to school.

19:05.344 --> 19:08.247
Yes, yes.

19:08.247 --> 19:09.915
Every day.
On time.

19:09.915 --> 19:12.349
I didn't know you
were such a good biker.

19:13.152 --> 19:15.687
Rust and women
are the same.

19:15.687 --> 19:17.856
"Rust and women
are the same"?

19:17.856 --> 19:19.591
They are the same.

19:19.591 --> 19:20.826
What is it?

19:20.826 --> 19:22.494
Your fat Yeah. Is that?

19:22.494 --> 19:24.096
Some joke...

19:24.096 --> 19:26.087
I don't know
what it meant.

19:30.602 --> 19:32.871
Look at that.
Oh, ho...

19:32.871 --> 19:35.841
You're so kind.
Look at me.

19:35.841 --> 19:37.943
He did all the work,
you know that.

19:37.943 --> 19:39.978
He's really good.

19:39.978 --> 19:42.147
Thank you, Jeff!

19:42.147 --> 19:44.672
You're welcome.

19:51.957 --> 19:53.926
Come in.

19:53.926 --> 19:56.360
Something up, Bill?

19:57.362 --> 20:00.024
No, no, I just couldn't
sleep, that's all.

20:08.407 --> 20:10.068
I have no money.

20:11.109 --> 20:13.579
All the money
that I inherited is...

20:13.579 --> 20:15.274
It's gone.

20:19.751 --> 20:21.446
And Linda...

20:23.288 --> 20:25.779
Linda...

20:26.825 --> 20:29.316
She spends and spends.

20:32.464 --> 20:34.989
And my salary's
nowhere near enough.

20:36.001 --> 20:38.231
I can't say no to her.

20:39.705 --> 20:42.265
The bank’s gonna
repossess the house...

20:44.977 --> 20:47.639
because I'm so far behind
on the payments.

20:49.014 --> 20:51.750
And I'm gonna lose Linda.

20:51.750 --> 20:54.620
I know it.

20:54.620 --> 20:56.110
I know I am.

21:00.626 --> 21:02.651
She loves you, Bill.

21:08.000 --> 21:09.991
Oh, don't cry.

21:16.775 --> 21:18.877
I shouldn't
have told you.

21:18.877 --> 21:19.945
Don't worry.

21:19.945 --> 21:21.813
- Shouldn't have told you.
- It's okay.

21:21.813 --> 21:23.148
Don't worry.

21:23.148 --> 21:24.716
No, I think you’ve
got enough... stuff.

21:24.716 --> 21:26.084
Would it make you
feel better

21:26.084 --> 21:28.186
if I told you
a secret?

21:28.186 --> 21:30.211
What secret
could you tell me?

21:36.962 --> 21:39.055
I'm going blind.

21:46.138 --> 21:48.340
Not yet, but...

21:48.340 --> 21:49.739
Soon.

21:53.345 --> 21:55.336
Maybe sometime
this y ear.

22:05.123 --> 22:06.818
Blind...

22:11.797 --> 22:14.789
It's not as bad
as it sounds.

22:16.335 --> 22:18.136
It's, uh...

22:18.136 --> 22:20.570
It's a family thing.

22:25.143 --> 22:26.478
But, blind?

22:26.478 --> 22:28.680
I’ve always known it.

22:28.680 --> 22:31.850
From... when I was
a little girl,

22:31.850 --> 22:32.839
I knew.

22:37.989 --> 22:39.616
And you're okay?

22:41.226 --> 22:43.695
Well, I came to America

22:43.695 --> 22:45.664
because in America,

22:45.664 --> 22:48.200
they can give Gene
an operation.

22:48.200 --> 22:49.189
You know?

22:50.469 --> 22:51.536
Gene?

22:51.536 --> 22:53.902
He doesn't know
about it.

22:54.940 --> 22:57.909
You... you
mustn't tell him,

22:57.909 --> 23:00.445
because then
it could get worse.

23:00.445 --> 23:02.581
I just have to save up
money, you know,

23:02.581 --> 23:04.640
enough money to...

23:05.650 --> 23:08.820
Oh, I almost got it.

23:08.820 --> 23:10.789
To, uh...

23:10.789 --> 23:13.058
for the operation.

23:13.058 --> 23:16.395
They can operate on Gene
when he turns 13.

23:16.395 --> 23:18.886
And you made up that story
about your father?

23:20.265 --> 23:22.467
H uh.

23:22.467 --> 23:24.369
I never had a father.

23:24.369 --> 23:27.270
I made up
his name, too.

23:29.474 --> 23:31.376
And that's why you
put in all these hours

23:31.376 --> 23:34.607
and do all these pins
and do everything you do.

23:36.014 --> 23:37.449
for him.

23:37.449 --> 23:39.383
for his operation.

23:44.723 --> 23:46.792
Well, it is my fault.

23:46.792 --> 23:48.794
I guess...

23:48.794 --> 23:50.887
How is it your fault?

23:56.134 --> 23:59.237
Because I...
I knew he would...

23:59.237 --> 24:01.933
he would have
bad eyes like me.

24:04.109 --> 24:05.610
But I had him...

24:05.610 --> 24:07.237
all the same.

24:10.849 --> 24:12.680
You're very strong.

24:14.986 --> 24:17.722
I'm not strong.

24:17.722 --> 24:19.424
I’ve got
little games I play

24:19.424 --> 24:21.085
when it goes really hard.

24:23.829 --> 24:26.161
When I'm working
in the factory...

24:27.899 --> 24:31.670
and the machines,
they make these...

24:31.670 --> 24:33.501
rhythms...

24:37.108 --> 24:39.211
And I just start dreaming,

24:39.211 --> 24:41.480
and it all becomes music.

24:41.480 --> 24:42.647
But you like movies,
don't you?

24:42.647 --> 24:44.749
- I love the movies.
- Yeah?

24:44.749 --> 24:46.785
I just love
the musicals.

24:46.785 --> 24:49.321
Oh, when they're
all tap dancing?

24:49.321 --> 24:51.323
All of them
tap dancing,

24:51.323 --> 24:53.859
all of them, this
huge, long line.

24:53.859 --> 24:55.393
I... wouldn't you
like to be

24:55.393 --> 24:56.724
in that big,
long line?

24:58.697 --> 24:59.698
Yeah.

24:59.698 --> 25:00.932
Kicking your feet
up there?

25:00.932 --> 25:02.033
Yeah.

25:02.033 --> 25:04.102
When they're,
like, spiraling up

25:04.102 --> 25:07.138
the huge,
enormous wedding cakes

25:07.138 --> 25:08.473
to the top?

25:08.473 --> 25:09.541
Yeah.

25:09.541 --> 25:10.675
But isn't that annoying

25:10.675 --> 25:12.911
when they do the last song
in the films, though?

25:12.911 --> 25:14.079
Why?

25:14.079 --> 25:16.748
Because you just know
when it goes really big,

25:16.748 --> 25:20.185
and the camera goes,
like, out of the roof,

25:20.185 --> 25:22.254
and you just know
it's gonna end.

25:22.254 --> 25:24.256
I hate that.

25:24.256 --> 25:25.524
I really hate that.

25:25.524 --> 25:28.460
I used to cheat on that
when I was a little girl

25:28.460 --> 25:30.729
back in Czechoslovakia.

25:30.729 --> 25:33.532
I would leave the cinema

25:33.532 --> 25:36.635
just after
the next to last song,

25:36.635 --> 25:39.832
and the film would
just go on forever.

25:42.073 --> 25:43.542
It's lovely, isn't it?

25:43.542 --> 25:45.009
That is lovely.

25:47.245 --> 25:48.580
Selma...

25:48.580 --> 25:50.916
Yeah?

25:50.916 --> 25:52.884
Thank you for
telling me your secret.

25:55.720 --> 25:57.654
Thanks for
telling me yours.

25:59.991 --> 26:02.260
Mum's the word, right?

26:02.260 --> 26:04.829
"Mum"?

26:04.829 --> 26:06.464
We don't tell anybody?

26:06.464 --> 26:08.600
Oh, yes.

26:08.600 --> 26:10.192
I won't tell
any one.

26:11.670 --> 26:13.572
Goodbye.

26:13.572 --> 26:14.368
Goodbye.

26:33.992 --> 26:35.460
Oh, thank you.

26:35.460 --> 26:37.629
So, can I get you
another?

26:37.629 --> 26:39.898
Yeah, sure.

26:39.898 --> 26:41.566
How about a big one?

26:41.566 --> 26:44.035
How many is there
in a big one?

26:44.035 --> 26:45.332
10, 000.

26:47.072 --> 26:48.630
I’ll have a big one.

26:52.744 --> 26:54.371
What's this
guy's name again?

26:56.047 --> 26:57.649
Who?

26:57.649 --> 26:59.050
The old man,
your old man,

26:59.050 --> 27:01.416
the guy we're carding
these pins for.

27:03.421 --> 27:05.090
Her father?

27:05.090 --> 27:07.726
I know.
Oldrich.

27:07.726 --> 27:08.727
Right?

27:08.727 --> 27:10.061
Yeah.

27:10.061 --> 27:12.430
Oldrich Novy.

27:12.430 --> 27:14.899
He used to dance
in Prague.

27:14.899 --> 27:16.301
You commies
make a big deal

27:16.301 --> 27:17.736
out of sharing
everything.

27:17.736 --> 27:20.038
Yeah.

27:20.038 --> 27:22.173
It's... It's
a good thing.

27:22.173 --> 27:24.142
What are you doing
here if, uh...

27:24.142 --> 27:25.977
Czechoslovakia's
so much better

27:25.977 --> 27:27.501
than the U.S. Of A?

28:05.717 --> 28:08.019
No, Selma, no!

28:08.019 --> 28:09.884
There are
two plates.

28:13.391 --> 28:14.881
It's all right.

28:17.829 --> 28:19.130
You know what happens

28:19.130 --> 28:20.859
when you put two plates
in, don't you?

28:24.302 --> 28:26.838
Well, she didn't do it.
I mean, it didn't happen...

28:26.838 --> 28:27.998
You destroy
the tool.

28:29.374 --> 28:30.909
It takes
a whole day

28:30.909 --> 28:31.976
to mend.

28:31.976 --> 28:34.079
Never two plates,
Selma, never!

28:34.079 --> 28:35.814
You cheated the doctor.

28:35.814 --> 28:37.949
You shouldn't be working
at the press at all.

28:37.949 --> 28:40.452
I mean, how dare you!
Just how much can you see?

28:40.452 --> 28:42.253
I could do my job
with my eyes closed.

28:42.253 --> 28:43.588
So could you.

28:43.588 --> 28:44.589
No.

28:44.589 --> 28:47.592
It's just because
I was daydreaming.

28:47.592 --> 28:48.693
Daydreaming?

28:48.693 --> 28:50.795
Dreaming about what?

28:50.795 --> 28:52.163
Oh, I just
hear music.

28:52.163 --> 28:54.399
Come on. I mean,
Selma, music?

28:54.399 --> 28:55.600
You could also
cut off your hand

28:55.600 --> 28:57.168
just like that.
You have to watch out

28:57.168 --> 28:58.436
every second.

28:58.436 --> 29:00.404
Promise me
you’ll stay awake.

29:01.840 --> 29:04.309
L... I promise I will
stop daydreaming.

29:04.309 --> 29:05.877
Aw, you're not...
You repeat,

29:05.877 --> 29:07.178
but you don't
even listen to me.

29:07.178 --> 29:08.975
I don't know why
I bother that much.

29:11.583 --> 29:14.119
Hi, Selma.

29:14.119 --> 29:15.453
If you're not
going with Kathy,

29:15.453 --> 29:17.489
can I give you
a lift?

29:17.489 --> 29:19.891
I don't want
a boyfriend.

29:19.891 --> 29:21.882
L... I told you.

29:22.927 --> 29:24.162
Yeah.

29:24.162 --> 29:25.964
You're a really
n ice guy, Jeff,

29:25.964 --> 29:26.998
but...

29:26.998 --> 29:29.660
I just don't have time
for a boyfriend.

29:31.136 --> 29:33.671
Not right now.

29:33.671 --> 29:36.174
I know.

29:36.174 --> 29:39.744
If I wanted a boyfriend,
it would be you, Jeff.

29:39.744 --> 29:41.405
I just don't want one
right now.

29:47.919 --> 29:49.187
All right.

29:49.187 --> 29:50.522
No problem, you know,

29:50.522 --> 29:52.547
on the back,
to have the bike there.

29:53.691 --> 29:55.181
Yeah.

30:00.999 --> 30:01.966
Bye, Jeff.

30:01.966 --> 30:04.569
I don't think it's
very safe, you know,

30:04.569 --> 30:08.206
to ride a bike
wearing glasses and all.

30:08.206 --> 30:09.641
- Selma?
- Bye, Jeff.

30:09.641 --> 30:11.131
H uh?

30:19.350 --> 30:20.715
Are you okay?

30:22.120 --> 30:23.678
Yeah, I'm fine.

30:25.223 --> 30:26.224
Hello, Selm.

30:26.224 --> 30:27.759
Hi, Bill.

30:27.759 --> 30:29.394
Headed home?

30:29.394 --> 30:30.762
Uh, yes.

30:30.762 --> 30:32.664
Want to put it
in the back?

30:32.664 --> 30:35.200
Oh, that would be
lovely. Yes, please.

30:35.200 --> 30:36.167
Hi, Jeff.

30:36.167 --> 30:38.102
Hey. Did you
see the truck?

30:38.102 --> 30:40.104
No?

30:40.104 --> 30:41.105
They're blind,

30:41.105 --> 30:44.442
driving
like crazy.

30:44.442 --> 30:46.477
He's what?

30:46.477 --> 30:49.037
He's driving
like crazy.

30:52.684 --> 30:54.252
Getting dirty.

30:54.252 --> 30:55.947
That's all right.

30:57.922 --> 30:59.724
Thank you.

30:59.724 --> 31:00.925
Bye, Jeff.

31:00.925 --> 31:02.594
Bye.

31:02.594 --> 31:03.891
Thank you, Bill.

31:07.599 --> 31:09.931
- Okay?
- Okay, yeah.

31:15.306 --> 31:17.041
If I could just make
the next payment,

31:17.041 --> 31:19.310
I'd have
a b it more time.

31:19.310 --> 31:21.312
Yeah.

31:21.312 --> 31:23.837
All I need is a loan.

31:29.053 --> 31:30.543
It'd just be a month.

31:32.724 --> 31:34.453
This money is Gene's.

31:37.662 --> 31:39.330
I'm sorry, Bill.

31:39.330 --> 31:41.165
That's all right.
I shouldn't have asked.

31:41.165 --> 31:42.967
Oh, you had to.
Don't worry,

31:42.967 --> 31:43.902
there's no harm
in asking.

31:43.902 --> 31:45.103
No, no, I
shouldn't have asked.

31:45.103 --> 31:47.333
Linda wants new couches.

31:54.646 --> 31:56.944
I could always
shoot myself.

31:58.750 --> 32:01.116
You mustn't say
things like that.

32:02.854 --> 32:05.516
It's...
Make things easier.

32:07.225 --> 32:10.295
- You know that, Bill.
- Aw, Selma.

32:10.295 --> 32:11.896
You mustn't say
things like that.

32:11.896 --> 32:13.363
Selma, I'm kidding.

32:20.104 --> 32:23.474
Hi, Selma.
Come on in.

32:23.474 --> 32:24.609
Hi, Gene.

32:24.609 --> 32:25.810
Good morning.

32:25.810 --> 32:26.435
Hi.

32:36.988 --> 32:39.691
How are you?

32:39.691 --> 32:41.022
Fine, thank you.

32:46.764 --> 32:47.765
Can I see the gun?

32:47.765 --> 32:49.596
Yeah, go on, sure.

32:52.170 --> 32:54.672
- He's got a gun?
- Sure.

32:54.672 --> 32:56.274
He's a police officer.

32:56.274 --> 32:59.010
I just didn't know
he would keep it here,

32:59.010 --> 33:00.144
in the house.

33:00.144 --> 33:02.146
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, yeah.

33:02.146 --> 33:04.671
He keeps it
in his desk.

33:13.358 --> 33:15.626
Maybe I should
pay more rent.

33:15.626 --> 33:17.228
It's been the same

33:17.228 --> 33:19.163
for the whole period
I’ve been here.

33:19.163 --> 33:21.766
No, Selma,
I won't hear it.

33:21.766 --> 33:23.668
You keep your money.
You need it more

33:23.668 --> 33:24.362
than we do.

34:14.786 --> 34:16.721
Two boxes?

34:16.721 --> 34:18.422
Did you decide
you are going to do

34:18.422 --> 34:20.324
two boxes at
the same time now?

34:20.324 --> 34:21.324
Yeah.

34:21.324 --> 34:23.261
Selma...
10:00 then?

34:23.261 --> 34:25.592
10:00.

34:26.731 --> 34:29.033
What happens
at 10:00?

34:29.033 --> 34:32.136
I'm... I'm gonna do
the night shift.

34:32.136 --> 34:33.737
The night shift?

34:33.737 --> 34:34.972
You can hardly see
well enough

34:34.972 --> 34:36.974
to do your own shift.

34:36.974 --> 34:38.643
It suits me fine.

34:38.643 --> 34:41.245
It's just after
drama class.

34:41.245 --> 34:42.803
You are going
to do that, too?

34:45.349 --> 34:47.284
I’ve had my fill
of you, Selma.

34:47.284 --> 34:48.553
You do
what you want.

34:48.553 --> 34:50.388
Go ahead,
break your neck.

34:50.388 --> 34:51.621
Do your night shift,

34:51.621 --> 34:52.857
but don't think
for one second

34:52.857 --> 34:55.291
I'm going to come
and rescue you.

35:01.666 --> 35:03.361
Selma?

35:06.003 --> 35:08.372
Kathy split already.

35:08.372 --> 35:10.475
I'm not looking
for Kathy.

35:10.475 --> 35:12.500
I was looking
for you.

35:14.045 --> 35:16.614
I just have to go to
drama rehearsal.

35:16.614 --> 35:18.309
So what do you say?

35:19.317 --> 35:20.952
You can always
ride your bike.

35:20.952 --> 35:23.888
You have it over there.

35:23.888 --> 35:25.323
I left it at home.

35:25.323 --> 35:27.892
I though t it'd be
quicker if I walked.

35:27.892 --> 35:30.161
How do you reckon that?

35:30.161 --> 35:33.562
I just walk along
the rail road tracks.

35:35.099 --> 35:37.235
It's a...

35:37.235 --> 35:38.566
shortcut.

35:57.922 --> 36:01.826
Look, I don't understand.
In musicals...

36:01.826 --> 36:05.387
why do they start to sing
and dance all of a sudden?

36:06.531 --> 36:11.869
I mean, I don't suddenly
start... to sing and dance.

36:11.869 --> 36:12.836
No...

36:14.805 --> 36:17.675
You're right, Jeff.
You don't.

36:17.675 --> 36:21.946
The last thing on the list
is the bake sale.

36:21.946 --> 36:23.811
Two sundays away.

36:25.616 --> 36:28.553
Hi, Selma.
Come on in, come on in.

36:28.553 --> 36:31.088
I'm gonna introduce you
to your understudy.

36:31.088 --> 36:32.890
My understudy?

36:32.890 --> 36:33.891
Yeah.

36:33.891 --> 36:36.327
This girl Suzan,
who Boris knows,

36:36.327 --> 36:39.230
is a good singer.
She's a good dancer.

36:39.230 --> 36:40.865
She'll learn
your part, too,

36:40.865 --> 36:43.868
because, say,
you get a cold,

36:43.868 --> 36:45.636
and...

36:45.636 --> 36:46.704
you can't do it,

36:46.704 --> 36:49.807
then the show
doesn't have to stop.

36:49.807 --> 36:50.808
Okay?

36:50.808 --> 36:54.005
Suzan, Selma.
Selma, Suzan.

36:56.581 --> 36:58.811
Could you take off
your glasses?

37:04.222 --> 37:05.823
I think
we'll do the part

37:05.823 --> 37:07.391
without glasses.

37:07.391 --> 37:09.961
Next sunday,
you will see

37:09.961 --> 37:11.696
both Marias.

37:11.696 --> 37:13.564
I mean, Selma will
do the role, really,

37:13.564 --> 37:15.967
but... I’ll have you
read part of it too.

37:15.967 --> 37:16.991
All right?

37:18.869 --> 37:20.171
It's your first time
on the night shift,

37:20.171 --> 37:21.172
right?

37:21.172 --> 37:22.940
While this
is being pressed,

37:22.940 --> 37:24.375
you’ll be cutting
on the other machine.

37:24.375 --> 37:26.677
That means
you’ll be in charge

37:26.677 --> 37:29.647
of two machines.

37:29.647 --> 37:33.551
You have to beat Sarah
over there, right?

37:33.551 --> 37:35.486
This pal let must
never be empty.

37:35.486 --> 37:37.588
Is it always
so dark in here?

37:37.588 --> 37:38.589
What?

37:38.589 --> 37:39.857
Is it always
so dark in here?

37:39.857 --> 37:41.559
It's exactly the same
as the daytime.

37:41.559 --> 37:42.727
Oh.
Okay.

37:42.727 --> 37:44.662
The only thing is you have
to work a little faster.

37:44.662 --> 37:45.863
That's what
you're paid for, right?

37:45.863 --> 37:46.964
- Okay.
- Okay?

37:46.964 --> 37:47.953
Thank you.

38:10.388 --> 38:12.523
- Excuse me.
- Yeah?

38:12.523 --> 38:13.658
You have to work
a little, you know,

38:13.658 --> 38:15.026
a little faster
than this.

38:15.026 --> 38:16.118
Okay.

38:40.251 --> 38:42.787
What are you
doing here?

38:42.787 --> 38:44.152
What do you think?

38:49.226 --> 38:52.797
I didn't put you down for
the night shift, Kathy.

38:52.797 --> 38:54.298
Run along, Norman.

38:54.298 --> 38:56.400
I'm on my own time now.

38:56.400 --> 38:58.569
How I spend it
is my own business.

38:58.569 --> 39:00.237
'Nigh t, ladies!

39:00.237 --> 39:01.261
Good night!

39:03.374 --> 39:05.076
F aster.

39:05.076 --> 39:06.444
A little faster.

39:06.444 --> 39:08.979
I like it better
when you dance.

39:08.979 --> 39:11.515
You should dance
more... Cvalda.

39:11.515 --> 39:14.279
I will dance
when there is music.

40:25.289 --> 40:27.124
It's music.

40:27.124 --> 40:28.785
Now dance.

43:40.851 --> 43:42.045
Selma!

43:43.053 --> 43:44.388
Stop that,
you’ve cut yourself!

43:44.388 --> 43:46.023
Get away from
the machine!

43:46.023 --> 43:47.320
Henry!

43:55.032 --> 43:57.500
Oh, Jeff is here.

43:59.203 --> 44:00.904
Hello, Jeff.

44:00.904 --> 44:02.072
Hi, Kathy.

44:02.072 --> 44:03.733
Do you live here?

44:05.576 --> 44:07.845
Though t she might
say yes to a ride

44:07.845 --> 44:09.713
when it's
this late.

44:09.713 --> 44:11.649
M-maybe Kathy...

44:11.649 --> 44:13.183
wants a ride.

44:13.183 --> 44:15.117
No, it's all right.

44:16.286 --> 44:18.122
What's that,
with your hand?

44:18.122 --> 44:19.957
She cut her...

44:19.957 --> 44:21.291
Cut my finger.

44:21.291 --> 44:23.360
Yeah. It's going
to be all right.

44:23.360 --> 44:25.863
The plates are sharp.

44:25.863 --> 44:26.864
Goodnight.

44:26.864 --> 44:27.853
Careful.

45:27.391 --> 45:30.019
I think I found
a solution to our problem.

45:32.730 --> 45:35.332
That makes me
really happy.

45:35.332 --> 45:38.335
It's nothing special...

45:38.335 --> 45:40.571
But I’ve made up my mind.
I'm gonna tell Linda,

45:40.571 --> 45:42.129
and, uh...

45:46.477 --> 45:49.207
I mean, after all,
she loves me, and...

45:53.717 --> 45:55.480
We’ll just
work it out together.

45:56.520 --> 45:59.421
That sounds like
a really good idea, Bill.

46:07.664 --> 46:09.900
I'm sorry, I’ll
let you get to bed.

46:09.900 --> 46:11.561
I guess I'm kind a tired.

46:12.770 --> 46:14.271
Thanks, Bill.

46:14.271 --> 46:15.506
Good night, Selma.

46:15.506 --> 46:16.837
Good night, Bill.

46:27.751 --> 46:29.150
Bill?

47:53.850 --> 47:55.477
What's happening now?

48:18.308 --> 48:20.242
Here we go.
Selma, are you ready?

48:29.553 --> 48:30.687
And...

48:30.687 --> 48:31.654
You're on.

48:36.426 --> 48:38.628
Cut. Cut, stop.

48:38.628 --> 48:40.764
Stop, please.

48:40.764 --> 48:42.999
This is Selma's entrance, okay?

48:42.999 --> 48:44.626
Yeah?

48:45.736 --> 48:47.567
Okay, Paul, please.

48:50.540 --> 48:52.909
How far
do you think it is?

48:52.909 --> 48:54.501
I don't know.

49:00.183 --> 49:01.241
And...

49:04.921 --> 49:06.823
Kathy, what
are you doing?

49:06.823 --> 49:08.825
This is
Maria's entrance.

49:08.825 --> 49:10.327
Yes.
I'm sorry.

49:10.327 --> 49:11.595
My mistake.

49:11.595 --> 49:12.729
Please, please!

49:12.729 --> 49:13.797
I don't have
all night!

49:13.797 --> 49:14.865
Six steps.

49:14.865 --> 49:16.799
Let's take this
a little more seriously.

49:26.877 --> 49:28.044
Good!

49:28.044 --> 49:30.514
Okay, I'm thinking
maybe, Selma...

49:30.514 --> 49:33.116
You could take a little
sort of circle around Boris

49:33.116 --> 49:34.684
on this next part,

49:34.684 --> 49:38.121
unless you have something else
you wanna suggest.

49:38.121 --> 49:40.557
I'm open.

49:40.557 --> 49:42.459
Okay?

49:42.459 --> 49:43.827
Samuel.

49:43.827 --> 49:45.762
Yes?

49:45.762 --> 49:47.097
I need to
talk to you.

49:47.097 --> 49:49.699
Oh, Selma, please, if
it's about the drummer,

49:49.699 --> 49:51.368
I have been looking
everywhere for a drummer...

49:51.368 --> 49:53.470
It's not
about the drummer.

49:53.470 --> 49:54.960
It's not
about the drummer.

49:59.576 --> 50:01.945
Um... just a quick word.

50:01.945 --> 50:03.780
Do you wanna
go outside?

50:03.780 --> 50:04.848
Yup.

50:04.848 --> 50:05.974
Okay.

50:15.392 --> 50:18.628
L... I'm not
gonna play Maria.

50:18.628 --> 50:20.493
What?

50:21.731 --> 50:24.034
My heart just
isn't in this...

50:24.034 --> 50:26.436
Like, I shouldn't
be wasting my time

50:26.436 --> 50:27.904
on something...

50:27.904 --> 50:30.805
that isn't...
that important really.

50:33.844 --> 50:36.880
I’ve been watching Suzan,
and she's...

50:36.880 --> 50:37.948
She's great.

50:37.948 --> 50:40.550
She's... She's very...

50:40.550 --> 50:42.419
She's a much better dancer
than I am.

50:42.419 --> 50:43.420
Terrific.

50:43.420 --> 50:46.389
Suzan's terrific.
I'm not denying that,

50:46.389 --> 50:49.226
but you... I though t
you lived for musicals.

50:49.226 --> 50:51.661
So you’ve been pretending
the whole time?

50:51.661 --> 50:53.730
Yes.

50:53.730 --> 50:56.633
I’ve just been pretending.

50:56.633 --> 50:58.635
I don't know what else
I could do with you.

50:58.635 --> 51:00.036
I’ve got everything
cast right now.

51:00.036 --> 51:02.005
Yeah.

51:02.005 --> 51:04.508
The only part that's left
is the old nun

51:04.508 --> 51:06.910
who lets Maria out
of the convent gate.

51:06.910 --> 51:08.211
I don't think
you'd want that part.

51:08.211 --> 51:11.548
There's no dancing
in that.

51:11.548 --> 51:13.383
She's
quite serious then?

51:13.383 --> 51:14.851
She's serious.

51:14.851 --> 51:16.920
It's important
for the part.

51:16.920 --> 51:18.820
Okay. I'm not
dancing really.

51:20.123 --> 51:21.758
No.

51:21.758 --> 51:24.828
I could put a little b it
of dancing in there.

51:24.828 --> 51:26.363
You think so?

51:26.363 --> 51:29.933
It... I didn't
have it in mind.

51:29.933 --> 51:32.736
You can have
your tapping.

51:32.736 --> 51:35.672
She could be just
a little... humorous

51:35.672 --> 51:37.340
once in a while...

51:37.340 --> 51:38.967
even though
she's a nun.

51:41.978 --> 51:44.105
You’ll always be
my perfect Maria.

51:47.017 --> 51:49.719
Where are all
the hairpins today?

51:49.719 --> 51:51.488
I left them at home.

51:51.488 --> 51:54.190
And she won't be
playing Maria.

51:54.190 --> 51:56.192
What do you reckon
I'm gonna do

51:56.192 --> 51:57.627
if I can't bawl you out
for learning your lines

51:57.627 --> 51:58.821
on company time?

52:00.163 --> 52:02.132
One... two...

52:02.132 --> 52:03.360
Three!

52:06.136 --> 52:08.271
What kind of a joke
is that?

52:08.271 --> 52:09.172
Well, she's beating me.

52:09.172 --> 52:11.374
I need a word with you.

52:11.374 --> 52:12.976
We're talking
right now.

52:12.976 --> 52:14.744
All right...

52:14.744 --> 52:16.109
Come on.

52:24.688 --> 52:26.053
Please sit down.

52:28.992 --> 52:31.795
We were off
for the whole day.

52:31.795 --> 52:33.797
Everything stops when
the machine breaks.

52:33.797 --> 52:35.025
You know that.

52:36.533 --> 52:39.836
L... I can do my job
just fine...

52:39.836 --> 52:43.206
if I stick
to the day shift.

52:43.206 --> 52:45.408
This won't happen again.

52:45.408 --> 52:48.812
Look, I daydream
too much.

52:48.812 --> 52:51.610
L... I decided to quit.

52:53.783 --> 52:54.909
And...

52:56.686 --> 52:59.553
And I guess,
then l... I forgot.

53:02.692 --> 53:05.160
I’ve been ordered
to let you go, Selma.

53:12.435 --> 53:14.070
You're not
gonna have to pay

53:14.070 --> 53:15.605
for the machine
you broke.

53:15.605 --> 53:17.941
I got them
to agree to that.

53:17.941 --> 53:19.533
Uh, thanks, Norman.

53:24.114 --> 53:27.515
This is your salary.

53:29.119 --> 53:32.455
And you know, um...

53:32.455 --> 53:34.658
Maybe we can find you
something

53:34.658 --> 53:37.494
away from the machines

53:37.494 --> 53:39.663
where your eyesight
wouldn't matter so much.

53:39.663 --> 53:40.563
Yeah...

53:40.563 --> 53:42.365
Not right away.

53:42.365 --> 53:44.134
That's very kind
of you.

53:44.134 --> 53:45.402
I better go.

53:45.402 --> 53:48.772
I’ll be okay.
I really will.

53:48.772 --> 53:50.640
Thanks, Norman.

53:50.640 --> 53:52.375
Thank you, Selma.

53:52.375 --> 53:53.364
Thank you.

54:11.528 --> 54:13.396
What is she
going to do now?

54:13.396 --> 54:15.227
Did you ever think
about that?

54:18.735 --> 54:20.837
Don't worry, Kathy.
Really.

54:20.837 --> 54:22.395
I'm gonna be fine.

54:25.041 --> 54:26.776
Has anybody
seen Jeff today?

54:26.776 --> 54:28.845
He's usually here
early, Selma,

54:28.845 --> 54:30.714
but not this early.

54:30.714 --> 54:32.045
It's a shame.

54:41.725 --> 54:43.556
Selma!

54:45.695 --> 54:47.720
Selma...

54:51.468 --> 54:53.937
I could give you
a lift if you want.

54:53.937 --> 54:56.439
L... I will need a lift...

54:56.439 --> 54:59.442
Later.

54:59.442 --> 55:01.111
I need to do
something important

55:01.111 --> 55:03.341
at... at 3:00.

55:04.481 --> 55:07.780
Well, you need to get
your truck then, don't you?

55:08.818 --> 55:09.785
Yeah.

55:17.961 --> 55:21.431
Train's coming.
Get off the track, Jeff.

55:21.431 --> 55:24.067
You have to be careful.

55:24.067 --> 55:25.659
Stay to the side.

55:32.475 --> 55:34.568
You can't see,
can you?

55:52.061 --> 55:54.791
What is there to see?

01:00:54.397 --> 01:00:56.888
You can't see,
can you?

01:00:58.935 --> 01:01:00.835
See you at 3:00.

01:01:07.610 --> 01:01:09.373
I can see.

01:02:04.534 --> 01:02:06.900
Gene hasn't
come back yet.

01:02:09.572 --> 01:02:12.475
I need to talk to Bill.

01:02:12.475 --> 01:02:14.010
He decided to
take the day off

01:02:14.010 --> 01:02:16.137
to go to the ban k
for his box.

01:02:18.181 --> 01:02:19.815
Is he... is he upstairs?

01:02:19.815 --> 01:02:20.804
Yeah.

01:02:23.319 --> 01:02:25.555
I know everything, Selma.

01:02:25.555 --> 01:02:26.923
Bill told me.

01:02:26.923 --> 01:02:29.391
I want you to move out!

01:02:34.363 --> 01:02:36.265
L... I don't understand.

01:02:36.265 --> 01:02:38.563
Wh-what would you know?

01:02:41.103 --> 01:02:43.573
That you came on
to him.

01:02:43.573 --> 01:02:45.975
That you asked him
into the trailer,

01:02:45.975 --> 01:02:47.738
but he
turned you down!

01:02:53.583 --> 01:02:55.847
You’ve got nothing
to say for yourself?

01:02:57.720 --> 01:02:59.488
No.

01:02:59.488 --> 01:03:01.319
I want to talk to Bill.

01:03:21.310 --> 01:03:22.971
Hi, Bill.

01:03:26.349 --> 01:03:28.874
Linda saw me go up
to the, um...

01:03:31.254 --> 01:03:33.222
Up to the trailer.

01:03:35.625 --> 01:03:38.594
I told her it was you
who wanted to, uh...

01:03:38.594 --> 01:03:40.329
That you'd...

01:03:40.329 --> 01:03:43.196
That you'd fallen
in love with me.

01:03:44.300 --> 01:03:47.603
I know.
She told me.

01:03:47.603 --> 01:03:49.505
And what did
you tell her?

01:03:49.505 --> 01:03:51.374
Nothing.

01:03:51.374 --> 01:03:54.543
You didn't tell her
I was lying?

01:03:54.543 --> 01:03:56.875
Mum's the word, right?

01:04:04.253 --> 01:04:06.721
Linda told me
you went to the ban k.

01:04:08.758 --> 01:04:10.919
I went to the ban k
to ask for more time.

01:04:15.464 --> 01:04:16.899
But I couldn't do it.

01:04:16.899 --> 01:04:20.232
And I brought the box
home instead.

01:04:21.237 --> 01:04:22.738
Linda always
gets so proud

01:04:22.738 --> 01:04:25.298
when she sees me
sitting in here with it.

01:04:26.909 --> 01:04:29.645
But you have put
my money in it,

01:04:29.645 --> 01:04:31.010
haven't you?

01:04:33.449 --> 01:04:36.213
To make it look
like it's yours.

01:04:41.123 --> 01:04:43.819
I tried to shoot
myself, but...

01:04:47.530 --> 01:04:49.498
I couldn't
do that either.

01:04:52.301 --> 01:04:54.370
But it's my money, Bill.

01:04:54.370 --> 01:04:57.606
I'm gonna have to take it.

01:04:57.606 --> 01:04:59.335
Well, you
can have it back.

01:05:02.078 --> 01:05:03.579
No, you can have it.

01:05:03.579 --> 01:05:04.580
Bill...

01:05:04.580 --> 01:05:07.708
You can have it back
in a month.

01:05:11.654 --> 01:05:13.823
But... but I can't
do that, Bill.

01:05:13.823 --> 01:05:14.824
Selma.

01:05:14.824 --> 01:05:17.893
L... I’ve decided to...

01:05:17.893 --> 01:05:19.662
to pay the doctor

01:05:19.662 --> 01:05:22.298
this afternoon.

01:05:22.298 --> 01:05:24.800
I can't save up more money.

01:05:24.800 --> 01:05:26.631
That's over now.

01:05:32.441 --> 01:05:34.410
Gene doesn't
even turn 13

01:05:34.410 --> 01:05:36.779
until after Christmas.

01:05:36.779 --> 01:05:40.349
It was $2, 026

01:05:40.349 --> 01:05:42.685
and 10 cents

01:05:42.685 --> 01:05:44.016
in the tin.

01:05:45.821 --> 01:05:48.551
I can't count it now,
but I trust you.

01:05:50.426 --> 01:05:52.628
And it's...

01:05:52.628 --> 01:05:55.119
$30 I got today...

01:05:56.399 --> 01:05:58.067
which makes it

01:05:58.067 --> 01:06:02.128
2, 056...

01:06:03.139 --> 01:06:04.707
and 10 cents.

01:06:04.707 --> 01:06:06.868
It's not enough.

01:06:08.010 --> 01:06:09.545
But it’ll have to do.

01:06:09.545 --> 01:06:11.080
Selma...

01:06:11.080 --> 01:06:13.640
- Bye, Bill.
- Selma...

01:06:20.623 --> 01:06:22.887
Selma, stop.

01:06:25.060 --> 01:06:26.652
I'm pointing my gun
at you, Selma.

01:06:32.168 --> 01:06:34.403
I don't believe you.

01:06:34.403 --> 01:06:36.705
You're just trying
to scare me.

01:06:36.705 --> 01:06:38.730
I can't see a gun.

01:06:39.608 --> 01:06:41.410
Selma...

01:06:41.410 --> 01:06:43.245
Just... feel this.
Feel this.

01:06:43.245 --> 01:06:45.338
Just feel it!
Feel it!

01:06:47.783 --> 01:06:49.885
Do you believe
I have the gun?

01:06:49.885 --> 01:06:52.321
I believe you.

01:06:52.321 --> 01:06:53.589
But it's my money.

01:06:53.589 --> 01:06:55.524
No, it's my money.

01:06:55.524 --> 01:06:57.860
It's the money
I had in my box.

01:06:57.860 --> 01:06:59.895
And you're trying
to steal it from me.

01:06:59.895 --> 01:07:01.897
Selma?

01:07:01.897 --> 01:07:03.999
Selma!
Selma, stop!

01:07:03.999 --> 01:07:05.935
Selma, stop!
Linda!

01:07:05.935 --> 01:07:07.470
- No!
- Linda! Linda!

01:07:07.470 --> 01:07:09.631
What's the matter,
Bill?

01:07:12.141 --> 01:07:14.166
She tried to
steal the money.

01:07:15.711 --> 01:07:17.580
She knew I had
the gun in my...

01:07:17.580 --> 01:07:19.215
in my drawer
and she...

01:07:19.215 --> 01:07:20.549
Is that why
you wanted him,

01:07:20.549 --> 01:07:21.951
for the money?

01:07:21.951 --> 01:07:24.053
Go out to the car
and get my handcuffs.

01:07:24.053 --> 01:07:26.214
Go get the handcuffs.

01:07:28.457 --> 01:07:31.160
Give me the money.

01:07:31.160 --> 01:07:33.195
Give me the money.

01:07:33.195 --> 01:07:36.131
Give me the money
and I’ll let you go.

01:07:36.131 --> 01:07:37.533
No.

01:07:37.533 --> 01:07:38.934
No.

01:07:38.934 --> 01:07:40.231
Where should I go?

01:07:41.504 --> 01:07:43.105
Just give me
the money.

01:07:43.105 --> 01:07:45.174
Selma.

01:07:45.174 --> 01:07:47.309
Just give me
the money!

01:07:47.309 --> 01:07:48.377
The money.

01:07:48.377 --> 01:07:49.778
Give me the money!

01:07:49.778 --> 01:07:50.880
No!

01:07:50.880 --> 01:07:51.680
No!

01:07:51.680 --> 01:07:53.204
- Get...
- No!

01:07:56.485 --> 01:07:57.816
Bill!
Oh, Bill!

01:08:02.424 --> 01:08:03.891
You shot me.

01:08:10.332 --> 01:08:11.967
No, no, Selma.

01:08:11.967 --> 01:08:13.602
You did the right thing.

01:08:13.602 --> 01:08:16.196
I should’ve done it
myself.

01:08:22.176 --> 01:08:23.769
Kill me.

01:08:26.282 --> 01:08:28.182
Just kill me.

01:08:29.385 --> 01:08:32.287
Will you just be
my friend...

01:08:32.287 --> 01:08:34.823
and show some mercy,
please, and just...

01:08:34.823 --> 01:08:35.890
kill me?

01:08:35.890 --> 01:08:38.594
Your handcuffs aren't
in the car, Bill.

01:08:38.594 --> 01:08:40.296
Just show
some mercy, Selma,

01:08:40.296 --> 01:08:41.661
and just...

01:08:46.201 --> 01:08:47.803
Linda, run.

01:08:47.803 --> 01:08:50.139
Run up to Miller’s farm.
Just run up to Miller’s farm

01:08:50.139 --> 01:08:52.741
and call the station.
Tell them to hurry.

01:08:52.741 --> 01:08:55.642
Run! Get up there!
Go on to Miller’s farm!

01:08:58.546 --> 01:09:00.537
If you want
the money...

01:09:05.888 --> 01:09:08.457
you're gonna have
to kill me.

01:09:08.457 --> 01:09:12.018
Don't do this to me.

01:09:21.236 --> 01:09:23.227
Don't do this
to me.

01:09:25.006 --> 01:09:26.702
I'm not letting go.

01:09:28.777 --> 01:09:30.845
No.

01:09:30.845 --> 01:09:32.747
Selma, shoot me!

01:09:32.747 --> 01:09:34.917
Just shoot me!
Shoot me! Shoot me!

01:09:34.917 --> 01:09:37.613
Shoot me!!

01:09:52.067 --> 01:09:53.836
Can't you
just stand up

01:09:53.836 --> 01:09:56.498
and pull
the goddamn trigger!

01:10:17.292 --> 01:10:19.556
I’ll have to
take the money.

01:15:24.166 --> 01:15:25.793
forgive me.

01:19:03.285 --> 01:19:04.752
Selma?

01:19:09.391 --> 01:19:11.916
Jeff.

01:19:19.334 --> 01:19:21.268
What are you
doing here?

01:19:26.208 --> 01:19:27.903
Is it al ready 3:00?

01:19:30.345 --> 01:19:31.980
Uh, not really.

01:19:31.980 --> 01:19:33.811
Hell, I'm always early.

01:19:42.490 --> 01:19:45.026
You cut yourself again.

01:19:45.026 --> 01:19:47.796
There's some blood
on your blouse.

01:19:47.796 --> 01:19:50.966
Strange.

01:19:50.966 --> 01:19:53.161
I couldn't feel it
at all.

01:20:29.671 --> 01:20:31.263
Selma...

01:20:33.141 --> 01:20:34.733
We're here now.

01:20:41.483 --> 01:20:43.212
By the bus stop?

01:20:45.453 --> 01:20:47.387
Yeah, the bus stop.

01:20:48.390 --> 01:20:50.458
It's over there.

01:20:50.458 --> 01:20:53.295
And the lake
is here?

01:20:53.295 --> 01:20:56.097
Promise me
that you won't follow me.

01:20:56.097 --> 01:20:58.156
Promise.

01:21:02.637 --> 01:21:04.468
Yeah, I promise.

01:22:50.645 --> 01:22:53.314
Dobry Vecer,
Pane Doktore.

01:22:53.314 --> 01:22:55.049
Dobry Vecer.

01:22:55.049 --> 01:22:57.745
I would like to pay
for the operation now.

01:22:59.921 --> 01:23:02.791
$2, 056...

01:23:02.791 --> 01:23:06.194
and 10 cents.

01:23:06.194 --> 01:23:08.530
I know it's not quite

01:23:08.530 --> 01:23:11.566
what you told me, but...

01:23:11.566 --> 01:23:13.468
but it's all
I could get together.

01:23:13.468 --> 01:23:15.231
Well.

01:23:19.007 --> 01:23:20.809
What last name

01:23:20.809 --> 01:23:22.444
shall I put
on the receipt?

01:23:22.444 --> 01:23:25.513
Oh, I don't need
a receipt.

01:23:25.513 --> 01:23:28.049
I really don't.

01:23:28.049 --> 01:23:29.951
I have to know
the name of your son.

01:23:29.951 --> 01:23:32.146
When he comes in
for his operation.

01:23:34.022 --> 01:23:35.580
Novy...

01:23:38.193 --> 01:23:39.594
He will come,

01:23:39.594 --> 01:23:42.563
and he will say
that his name is Novy.

01:23:44.232 --> 01:23:47.035
And then
you will know...

01:23:47.035 --> 01:23:48.970
that he has
been paid for.

01:23:48.970 --> 01:23:51.372
Novy?

01:23:51.372 --> 01:23:54.609
Like Oldrich Novy,

01:23:54.609 --> 01:23:56.377
the tap dancer?

01:23:56.377 --> 01:23:58.313
It is strange,
isn't it?

01:23:58.313 --> 01:24:00.014
But he never really
made it over here,

01:24:00.014 --> 01:24:01.749
did he?

01:24:01.749 --> 01:24:05.720
I saw his films
when I was a k id.

01:24:05.720 --> 01:24:08.022
He was in
the first musical

01:24:08.022 --> 01:24:10.191
I ever saw.

01:24:10.191 --> 01:24:12.091
Same here.

01:24:17.699 --> 01:24:19.360
Selma?

01:24:34.282 --> 01:24:36.273
It's Tuesday night.

01:24:39.254 --> 01:24:40.983
What about
your rehearsal?

01:24:43.925 --> 01:24:45.517
Yeah, I guess.

01:24:47.161 --> 01:24:49.264
You want to go?

01:24:49.264 --> 01:24:51.065
Yeah.

01:24:51.065 --> 01:24:52.767
Then maybe put
your arm around her,

01:24:52.767 --> 01:24:54.632
and... a little b it of...

01:24:56.404 --> 01:24:58.006
Hi, Selma.

01:24:58.006 --> 01:25:00.308
Hi, Samuel.

01:25:00.308 --> 01:25:02.833
We weren't sure you'd
show up, actually.

01:25:04.112 --> 01:25:05.477
Sure, I'd show up.

01:25:07.649 --> 01:25:08.650
Hi.

01:25:08.650 --> 01:25:10.351
Nice to see you.

01:25:10.351 --> 01:25:11.052
Be right back.

01:25:11.052 --> 01:25:12.451
Okay.

01:25:27.535 --> 01:25:29.571
She's here.

01:25:29.571 --> 01:25:30.572
Yeah.

01:25:30.572 --> 01:25:32.164
Okay.

01:25:33.341 --> 01:25:34.330
Okay.

01:25:38.980 --> 01:25:41.182
Okay, I think... I
think you could...

01:25:41.182 --> 01:25:44.285
try it one more time
for me.

01:25:44.285 --> 01:25:46.988
But I should...
I should be going now.

01:25:46.988 --> 01:25:49.422
I think Gene may wonder
where I am.

01:25:51.426 --> 01:25:53.728
Jeff, he... he hasn't
seen me all day.

01:25:53.728 --> 01:25:55.830
I think maybe we
could do your scene.

01:25:55.830 --> 01:25:57.732
Let's do
the tapping scene.

01:25:57.732 --> 01:26:00.201
Okay? We haven't
done it in weeks,

01:26:00.201 --> 01:26:01.636
and we really need
to rehearse it,

01:26:01.636 --> 01:26:02.804
and while you're here,
we might as well

01:26:02.804 --> 01:26:05.807
take advantage
of the time, please?

01:26:05.807 --> 01:26:07.275
Okay, let's do
the tapping scene.

01:26:07.275 --> 01:26:08.409
You come offstage...

01:26:08.409 --> 01:26:09.777
Let me have
the nuns up there.

01:26:09.777 --> 01:26:11.179
I magi...
you're going to do

01:26:11.179 --> 01:26:12.180
Selma's part
for her

01:26:12.180 --> 01:26:13.545
for right now,
all right?

01:26:18.119 --> 01:26:19.187
You like it?

01:26:19.187 --> 01:26:21.422
Yes.

01:26:21.422 --> 01:26:23.356
We haven't done it
for a while.

01:26:49.017 --> 01:26:50.518
Remember that part
we did where...

01:26:50.518 --> 01:26:52.053
where you, uh...

01:26:52.053 --> 01:26:54.188
you come to
the convent gate

01:26:54.188 --> 01:26:56.391
to say goodbye
to the... to Maria?

01:26:56.391 --> 01:26:58.393
I should leave, Jeff.

01:26:58.393 --> 01:26:59.460
What?

01:26:59.460 --> 01:27:01.429
Gene... Gene is
probably worried now.

01:27:01.429 --> 01:27:03.631
I haven't seen him
all day.

01:27:03.631 --> 01:27:04.962
All right.

01:27:07.435 --> 01:27:09.604
I'm sorry, Samuel, but...

01:27:09.604 --> 01:27:11.439
Betty, come here
for a second, please.

01:27:11.439 --> 01:27:12.540
The drummer
that you wanted...

01:27:12.540 --> 01:27:14.108
Remember, you asked
me for a drummer?

01:27:14.108 --> 01:27:16.044
I found somebody.
She's fantastic.

01:27:16.044 --> 01:27:17.445
Her name's Betty.
She's right here

01:27:17.445 --> 01:27:18.579
for the first time
tonight.

01:27:18.579 --> 01:27:21.516
Please meet her.
Selma, this is Betty.

01:27:21.516 --> 01:27:22.750
Hi, Betty.

01:27:22.750 --> 01:27:25.753
You play the drums?

01:27:25.753 --> 01:27:26.821
Yeah.

01:27:26.821 --> 01:27:28.389
Tell her how long
you’ve been studying.

01:27:28.389 --> 01:27:29.757
Two years.

01:27:29.757 --> 01:27:31.526
She's wonderful.

01:27:31.526 --> 01:27:32.994
You’ve got to stay
and enjoy this.

01:27:32.994 --> 01:27:34.896
You’ve got to...
I have an idea.

01:27:34.896 --> 01:27:37.160
Let's do the finale.

01:27:37.265 --> 01:27:40.201
I just remembered,
You hate finales.

01:27:40.201 --> 01:27:41.803
No finale!

01:27:41.803 --> 01:27:44.172
I’ve a better idea.

01:27:44.172 --> 01:27:46.106
"Climb Every Mountain,"
part one.

01:29:47.595 --> 01:29:49.330
The state will show

01:29:49.330 --> 01:29:52.066
that the defendant
has not only perpetrated

01:29:52.066 --> 01:29:54.168
the most callous...

01:29:54.168 --> 01:29:57.137
and well-planned homicide
in recent memory...

01:29:58.573 --> 01:30:01.909
but is also
a fundamentally selfish

01:30:01.909 --> 01:30:04.212
individual...

01:30:04.212 --> 01:30:06.247
who cynically hides

01:30:06.247 --> 01:30:08.149
behind a handicap,

01:30:08.149 --> 01:30:10.418
devoid of sympathy
for anybody

01:30:10.418 --> 01:30:11.885
but herself.

01:30:13.487 --> 01:30:16.657
This woman found
trust and friendship

01:30:16.657 --> 01:30:20.528
when she sough t refuge
in our country,

01:30:20.528 --> 01:30:22.230
and the evidence will show

01:30:22.230 --> 01:30:25.366
that she has repaid
such kindness with betrayal,

01:30:25.366 --> 01:30:27.168
robbery, and murder,

01:30:27.168 --> 01:30:29.637
inflicted upon
the very people

01:30:29.637 --> 01:30:32.663
who opened their homes
and hearts to her.

01:30:34.876 --> 01:30:36.605
Ladies and gentlemen
of the jury...

01:30:37.678 --> 01:30:40.448
The evidence will pro v e
that she herself...

01:30:40.448 --> 01:30:43.906
did not show that mercy
she will ask of us.

01:30:45.219 --> 01:30:48.188
Is this the bag here,
detective?

01:30:51.726 --> 01:30:52.927
Yes,
the very same.

01:30:52.927 --> 01:30:55.162
Houston's blood
was all over it.

01:30:55.162 --> 01:30:57.999
Well, shortly
before the homicide,

01:30:57.999 --> 01:31:00.501
I had a check up
on her vision,

01:31:00.501 --> 01:31:04.438
and I found
that she was myopic.

01:31:04.438 --> 01:31:05.640
It's nearsighted...

01:31:05.640 --> 01:31:08.200
Nearsighted, but...
She could see.

01:31:09.210 --> 01:31:10.199
Yes.

01:31:11.779 --> 01:31:13.514
She said communism was...

01:31:13.514 --> 01:31:15.505
better for human beings.

01:31:17.451 --> 01:31:18.886
She had nothing
but contempt

01:31:18.886 --> 01:31:21.022
for our great country
and its principles?

01:31:21.022 --> 01:31:23.791
Apart from its musicals.
She said the American one...

01:31:23.791 --> 01:31:25.393
the American ones
were better.

01:31:25.393 --> 01:31:27.295
So...

01:31:27.295 --> 01:31:29.463
the defendant
preferred Hollywood

01:31:29.463 --> 01:31:31.021
to Vladivostok.

01:31:32.166 --> 01:31:34.902
I suppose that's
an acknowledgement of sorts.

01:31:34.902 --> 01:31:36.304
She just asked
many times

01:31:36.304 --> 01:31:38.306
about the money.

01:31:38.306 --> 01:31:40.408
She wanted to know
where it was?

01:31:40.408 --> 01:31:41.709
That's right.

01:31:41.709 --> 01:31:43.778
She asked you
about the gun?

01:31:43.778 --> 01:31:45.546
Yes, she did.

01:31:45.546 --> 01:31:48.015
She wanted to know
where it was kept?

01:31:48.015 --> 01:31:49.984
That's right.

01:31:49.984 --> 01:31:51.552
Bill was lying on the floor

01:31:51.552 --> 01:31:54.455
and... he was wounded.

01:31:54.455 --> 01:31:56.857
And...

01:31:56.857 --> 01:31:58.960
And...

01:31:58.960 --> 01:32:01.562
He was pleading for his life?

01:32:01.562 --> 01:32:02.530
Yes.

01:32:02.530 --> 01:32:04.966
"L... I beg you,
I beg you,

01:32:04.966 --> 01:32:06.100
I beg you."

01:32:06.100 --> 01:32:09.467
You showed him
no mercy, Selma!

01:32:15.176 --> 01:32:18.509
You shall have
no mercy either!

01:32:20.381 --> 01:32:23.612
Would you state your name
for the record, please?

01:32:26.554 --> 01:32:28.886
Selma Jezkova.

01:32:30.124 --> 01:32:33.928
And Bill and
Linda Houston...

01:32:33.928 --> 01:32:35.862
were your friends,
is that right?

01:32:39.467 --> 01:32:40.468
Yeah.

01:32:40.468 --> 01:32:42.370
In fact, you lived
in a trailer

01:32:42.370 --> 01:32:44.338
on their property.

01:32:48.209 --> 01:32:49.677
Yeah.

01:32:49.677 --> 01:32:51.579
And didn't they also

01:32:51.579 --> 01:32:53.247
take care
of your young son

01:32:53.247 --> 01:32:55.044
when you were at work?

01:33:00.087 --> 01:33:01.145
Yeah.

01:33:03.324 --> 01:33:04.492
They bough t him a...

01:33:04.492 --> 01:33:07.128
birthday present
recently.

01:33:07.128 --> 01:33:08.459
Is that right?

01:33:12.933 --> 01:33:15.060
Yeah. They
got him a bike.

01:33:17.038 --> 01:33:20.007
Right.

01:33:20.007 --> 01:33:22.610
Your sigh t
was poor,

01:33:22.610 --> 01:33:24.712
you claim,
contrary to

01:33:24.712 --> 01:33:27.203
the expert testimony
we have received.

01:33:28.616 --> 01:33:31.352
But you saw
well enough

01:33:31.352 --> 01:33:34.913
to inflict 34 wounds
on Bill Houston.

01:33:36.524 --> 01:33:39.084
So why did you
kill him, actually?

01:33:40.528 --> 01:33:42.553
If I may be
so bold to ask?

01:33:49.003 --> 01:33:50.732
He asked me to.

01:33:52.206 --> 01:33:53.908
He did?

01:33:53.908 --> 01:33:55.476
How intriguing.

01:33:55.476 --> 01:33:57.244
A man with
a fine career

01:33:57.244 --> 01:34:00.081
and some wealth,
a happy marriage,

01:34:00.081 --> 01:34:02.049
why would
this Bill Houston

01:34:02.049 --> 01:34:03.573
ask you to kill him?

01:34:09.323 --> 01:34:11.358
I promised not to say.

01:34:11.358 --> 01:34:14.562
Well, that clears
things up immensely.

01:34:14.562 --> 01:34:17.498
You promised
you wouldn't say.

01:34:17.498 --> 01:34:20.267
In that case, we'II just
have to take your word for it

01:34:20.267 --> 01:34:22.970
when you say
that the money you stole

01:34:22.970 --> 01:34:24.405
was your own,
despite the fact

01:34:24.405 --> 01:34:25.639
that Bill Houston's savings

01:34:25.639 --> 01:34:27.775
also disappeared
so mysteriously

01:34:27.775 --> 01:34:29.276
that same day.

01:34:29.276 --> 01:34:31.545
Just, uh...

01:34:31.545 --> 01:34:33.740
Just where did you
get your money?

01:34:37.918 --> 01:34:39.180
Well...

01:34:40.855 --> 01:34:43.257
I'd been saving up.

01:34:43.257 --> 01:34:47.027
Well, I suppose
you could call it that.

01:34:47.027 --> 01:34:49.430
What were these savings
to be used for?

01:34:49.430 --> 01:34:51.198
You never bough t your son

01:34:51.198 --> 01:34:53.134
so much as
a single birthday present,

01:34:53.134 --> 01:34:54.931
as we've heard.

01:34:58.302 --> 01:34:59.564
Yes?

01:35:01.405 --> 01:35:03.674
My... my father.

01:35:03.674 --> 01:35:06.302
In Czechoslovakia.

01:35:10.380 --> 01:35:11.904
Your father?

01:35:14.051 --> 01:35:15.586
And what,
pray tell...

01:35:15.586 --> 01:35:17.019
is his name?

01:35:21.558 --> 01:35:23.617
My... my father is...

01:35:26.363 --> 01:35:28.932
Oldrich Novy.

01:35:28.932 --> 01:35:30.058
So...

01:35:31.268 --> 01:35:33.236
We're meant to believe...

01:35:33.236 --> 01:35:35.138
that you killed
Bill Houston

01:35:35.138 --> 01:35:37.074
by inflicting
34 wounds on him

01:35:37.074 --> 01:35:39.676
because...

01:35:39.676 --> 01:35:41.645
He asked you to.

01:35:41.645 --> 01:35:44.414
Just as we're meant
to believe

01:35:44.414 --> 01:35:46.350
that you were blind
when you did it...

01:35:46.350 --> 01:35:50.487
Are meant to believe
that it was your own savings

01:35:50.487 --> 01:35:52.322
that you stole from him...

01:35:52.322 --> 01:35:53.790
Just as we're meant
to believe

01:35:53.790 --> 01:35:55.926
that you sent all you had

01:35:55.926 --> 01:35:57.794
to your father back home,

01:35:57.794 --> 01:36:00.763
a man by the name
of Oldrich Novy.

01:36:01.865 --> 01:36:03.196
Is that right?

01:36:07.671 --> 01:36:09.263
Yes.

01:36:10.774 --> 01:36:13.470
Thank you,
Miss Jezkova.

01:36:22.285 --> 01:36:23.887
Ladies and gentlemen
of the jury,

01:36:23.887 --> 01:36:26.790
you’ve now heard from
the defendant's own lips.

01:36:26.790 --> 01:36:28.792
You must believe her,

01:36:28.792 --> 01:36:31.328
just as you
must believe her

01:36:31.328 --> 01:36:33.597
when she claims
her father's name

01:36:33.597 --> 01:36:35.827
is Oldrich Novy.

01:36:37.067 --> 01:36:38.935
Your Honor...

01:36:38.935 --> 01:36:40.237
at this time,
the state calls

01:36:40.237 --> 01:36:41.898
to the witness stand...

01:36:43.440 --> 01:36:45.135
Oldrich Novy.

01:36:55.452 --> 01:36:57.320
Please state
your full name.

01:36:57.320 --> 01:36:59.823
The name is
Oldrich Novy.

01:36:59.823 --> 01:37:03.520
And you used to live
in Czechoslovakia?

01:37:04.528 --> 01:37:05.929
That is right.

01:37:05.929 --> 01:37:08.432
I live now in California,
as you know.

01:37:08.432 --> 01:37:10.701
That's right, that's
where we found you.

01:37:10.701 --> 01:37:13.904
What exactly is
your relationship

01:37:13.904 --> 01:37:15.735
with the defendant?

01:37:20.210 --> 01:37:22.007
I do not know her.

01:37:23.447 --> 01:37:25.348
You don't know her?

01:37:25.348 --> 01:37:26.616
So...

01:37:26.616 --> 01:37:29.186
You have not received money

01:37:29.186 --> 01:37:30.687
from her.

01:37:30.687 --> 01:37:32.122
Money that... that...

01:37:32.122 --> 01:37:34.556
she says was so dearly earned?

01:37:35.926 --> 01:37:37.260
No, I have not.

01:37:37.260 --> 01:37:39.285
Perhaps you're
not her father then?

01:37:40.564 --> 01:37:42.132
No, I am not.

01:37:42.132 --> 01:37:43.767
Well, if
this relationship

01:37:43.767 --> 01:37:46.837
was made up
by the defendant,

01:37:46.837 --> 01:37:48.138
then...

01:37:48.138 --> 01:37:49.206
can you think
of any way

01:37:49.206 --> 01:37:51.775
she might've come
to know your name?

01:37:51.775 --> 01:37:55.412
I was once well known
in Czechoslovakia

01:37:55.412 --> 01:37:58.148
uh... because of my profession.

01:37:58.148 --> 01:38:01.118
Yes, Mr. Oldrich Novy,
what is your profession?

01:38:01.118 --> 01:38:03.120
Maybe that can give us
a clue to why,

01:38:03.120 --> 01:38:05.589
why this somewhat...
romantic,

01:38:05.589 --> 01:38:07.758
certainly communistic, woman

01:38:07.758 --> 01:38:10.727
who worships Fred Astaire
but not his country,

01:38:10.727 --> 01:38:12.729
why she might've lied...

01:38:12.729 --> 01:38:14.898
and misused your name...

01:38:14.898 --> 01:38:18.135
to make us think
all her money was spent

01:38:18.135 --> 01:38:21.538
on a poor father
and not on her own vanity.

01:38:21.538 --> 01:38:22.706
What is it that you do?

01:38:22.706 --> 01:38:25.909
I was an actor.
I made films.

01:38:25.909 --> 01:38:28.207
They were musicals.

01:40:15.118 --> 01:40:16.745
Say it again!

01:41:39.035 --> 01:41:41.367
Will the court please rise?

01:41:43.440 --> 01:41:46.534
The honorable Judge
A. D. Mantle presiding.

01:41:57.754 --> 01:41:59.813
Have you reached a verdict?

01:42:01.591 --> 01:42:02.819
Yes, Your Honor.

01:42:22.112 --> 01:42:24.945
Will the defendant
please rise?

01:42:35.125 --> 01:42:37.360
We, the jury,
find the defendant

01:42:37.360 --> 01:42:39.396
Selma Jezkova

01:42:39.396 --> 01:42:41.331
guilty of murder
in the first degree

01:42:41.331 --> 01:42:44.401
and hereby sentence her
to death.

01:42:44.401 --> 01:42:47.137
Is this
the verdict of this jury?

01:42:47.137 --> 01:42:50.807
You fully understand
that it must be unanimous?

01:42:50.807 --> 01:42:53.209
We do, Your Honor.

01:42:53.209 --> 01:42:55.645
Selma Jezkova...

01:42:55.645 --> 01:42:58.048
You are hereby sentenced

01:42:58.048 --> 01:43:00.150
to be taken from this place

01:43:00.150 --> 01:43:02.652
and confined in
the state penitentiary

01:43:02.652 --> 01:43:05.955
until such time
as you shall be executed

01:43:05.955 --> 01:43:08.725
by being hanged
by the neck

01:43:08.725 --> 01:43:10.393
until you are dead.

01:43:10.393 --> 01:43:12.062
This court is adjourned.

01:43:12.062 --> 01:43:13.586
All rise!

01:43:31.548 --> 01:43:33.917
I’ve just heard
about the...

01:43:33.917 --> 01:43:36.519
Supreme Court decision.

01:43:36.519 --> 01:43:38.254
Yeah, I...

01:43:38.254 --> 01:43:41.087
I just want to talk
practical stuff.

01:43:45.395 --> 01:43:47.727
On Gene's birthday...

01:43:50.033 --> 01:43:53.403
he will receive
a letter.

01:43:53.403 --> 01:43:55.638
And it's so important,
Kathy...

01:43:55.638 --> 01:43:58.575
that he reads it
really carefully.

01:43:58.575 --> 01:44:01.811
I need you to take care
of that for me...

01:44:01.811 --> 01:44:03.880
because I'm not
gonna be there

01:44:03.880 --> 01:44:05.949
when he gets it.

01:44:05.949 --> 01:44:07.484
He should not be afraid,

01:44:07.484 --> 01:44:10.253
because there's nothing
to be afraid of, Kathy.

01:44:10.253 --> 01:44:14.257
Listen, Gene wants
to see you so badly.

01:44:14.257 --> 01:44:16.782
Won't you let him?
Please?

01:44:20.463 --> 01:44:22.363
There's nothing
for him to see.

01:44:24.934 --> 01:44:26.834
He's got you now,
Kathy.

01:44:30.006 --> 01:44:32.575
And there's
one more thing:

01:44:32.575 --> 01:44:35.311
He has to
call himself Novy.

01:44:35.311 --> 01:44:37.180
That's
very important.

01:44:37.180 --> 01:44:39.849
All right,
time's up, Selma.

01:44:39.849 --> 01:44:41.818
I know that sounds
a bit foolish.

01:44:41.818 --> 01:44:43.820
Novy?

01:44:43.820 --> 01:44:45.221
I'm sorry I didn't
tell you before

01:44:45.221 --> 01:44:47.257
about all this.
I just didn't dare to

01:44:47.257 --> 01:44:50.093
because they would
ruin everything.

01:44:50.093 --> 01:44:51.461
But what...
Why does he

01:44:51.461 --> 01:44:53.196
have to call himself Novy?

01:44:53.196 --> 01:44:55.298
Stop asking questions
like that, Cvalda.

01:44:55.298 --> 01:44:58.234
Please... let me
tell Gene hello...

01:44:58.234 --> 01:44:59.531
from you to him.

01:45:01.304 --> 01:45:02.669
No.

01:45:22.425 --> 01:45:24.188
I know you love
your son very much.

01:45:26.129 --> 01:45:27.926
I love him very much.

01:45:31.634 --> 01:45:34.102
Got a boy of my own
back home.

01:45:39.576 --> 01:45:42.067
You never told me that.

01:45:47.817 --> 01:45:49.118
Good night, Brenda.

01:45:49.118 --> 01:45:50.320
Good night.

01:45:50.320 --> 01:45:52.254
Say hi to your son
from me.

01:45:54.857 --> 01:45:56.085
Thank you, Selma.

01:46:53.683 --> 01:46:55.082
Can I help you?

01:46:56.085 --> 01:46:58.421
Did you once have
a patient called...

01:46:58.421 --> 01:47:01.357
Jezkova...

01:47:01.357 --> 01:47:04.827
Selma Jezkova?

01:47:04.827 --> 01:47:06.296
Well, if it wasn't
too long ago,

01:47:06.296 --> 01:47:08.196
I can check
my records for you.

01:47:10.967 --> 01:47:12.901
Jes... Jez... Jess...

01:47:13.903 --> 01:47:15.996
Sorry, there's no one
here by that name.

01:47:22.812 --> 01:47:24.439
What about Novy?

01:47:26.049 --> 01:47:28.384
I have good news for you.

01:47:28.384 --> 01:47:29.552
What's that?

01:47:29.552 --> 01:47:30.753
We found a new lawyer...

01:47:30.753 --> 01:47:34.090
and he's going to get
your case re-opened.

01:47:34.090 --> 01:47:36.854
He says your lawyer
was incompetent.

01:47:39.262 --> 01:47:40.627
What do you mean?

01:47:42.832 --> 01:47:44.959
Well, the case is
going to be re-opened.

01:47:46.502 --> 01:47:48.299
You won't get
the death sentence.

01:47:50.540 --> 01:47:52.175
Is that true?

01:47:52.175 --> 01:47:54.871
Yes. New information
has turned up.

01:47:56.045 --> 01:47:57.613
Wh-what information?

01:47:57.613 --> 01:47:59.649
Well, we know
the whole story, Selma.

01:47:59.649 --> 01:48:02.385
Why didn't you tell us
anything?

01:48:02.385 --> 01:48:04.087
You know, about...

01:48:04.087 --> 01:48:06.248
about the money
for Gene's operation.

01:48:09.759 --> 01:48:12.028
How did you find out?

01:48:12.028 --> 01:48:13.962
Well, Jeff talked
to the doctor.

01:48:16.132 --> 01:48:18.191
Does... does Gene know?

01:48:20.737 --> 01:48:22.204
I mean,
have you told Gene?

01:48:23.306 --> 01:48:25.842
No.
No, I didn't.

01:48:25.842 --> 01:48:28.044
But you’ve got
a much better case now.

01:48:28.044 --> 01:48:30.137
That's very important,
Kathy.

01:48:32.348 --> 01:48:34.984
His eyes might get
worse from worrying,

01:48:34.984 --> 01:48:36.975
and then the operation
won't work.

01:48:38.087 --> 01:48:39.856
Yes, but, Selma...

01:48:39.856 --> 01:48:41.791
Don't you see
that it would help you

01:48:41.791 --> 01:48:44.227
if they knew that you
were trying to save your son

01:48:44.227 --> 01:48:45.558
from going blind?

01:48:46.629 --> 01:48:48.464
The lawyer,
he'II come and see you

01:48:48.464 --> 01:48:50.600
in two weeks' time.

01:48:50.600 --> 01:48:51.634
Kathy, but, uh...

01:48:51.634 --> 01:48:53.436
You know
they're hanging me

01:48:53.436 --> 01:48:54.437
in one week.

01:48:54.437 --> 01:48:55.805
We know that,
but he says

01:48:55.805 --> 01:48:57.473
you can apply for a stay.

01:48:57.473 --> 01:48:59.907
You know, most cases
get one the first time.

01:49:03.613 --> 01:49:05.274
Well, you can smile.

01:49:06.682 --> 01:49:08.384
Selma...

01:49:08.384 --> 01:49:11.080
Yeah... it's just
too much for me.

01:49:14.457 --> 01:49:15.925
I though t
I was strong.

01:49:15.925 --> 01:49:18.194
I just can't
take it, Kathy.

01:49:18.194 --> 01:49:20.890
Apply for a stay.

01:49:33.009 --> 01:49:34.772
What if they
don't phone?

01:49:37.013 --> 01:49:40.950
Uh, well, you’ll be
transferred to the other...

01:49:40.950 --> 01:49:43.248
cell block
at some point tomorrow.

01:49:46.055 --> 01:49:48.990
That's the cell block
where they hang people.

01:49:52.795 --> 01:49:55.465
Yeah,
that's where they...

01:49:55.465 --> 01:49:58.267
spend the last day.

01:49:58.267 --> 01:50:01.471
And then they do
their 107 steps.

01:50:01.471 --> 01:50:04.574
It's from that room...

01:50:04.574 --> 01:50:06.439
to the gal lows,
isn't it?

01:50:08.444 --> 01:50:11.280
That's what they say,
Selma, but...

01:50:11.280 --> 01:50:12.648
Look at...

01:50:12.648 --> 01:50:14.517
You're gonna get
your stay.

01:50:14.517 --> 01:50:17.019
Why don't you try to
think of something n ice,

01:50:17.019 --> 01:50:18.111
all right?

01:50:21.657 --> 01:50:23.989
It's just
so quiet here.

01:50:26.429 --> 01:50:28.488
What's that got
to do with it, Selma?

01:50:33.302 --> 01:50:36.669
You know, when I used
to work in the factory...

01:50:38.608 --> 01:50:41.978
I used to dream
that I was in a musical,

01:50:41.978 --> 01:50:43.513
because, in a musical,

01:50:43.513 --> 01:50:46.448
nothing dreadful
ever happens.

01:50:50.586 --> 01:50:52.713
But it's so quiet here.

01:50:55.224 --> 01:50:58.027
Don't the prisoners
march or something?

01:50:58.027 --> 01:50:59.195
March?
No.

01:50:59.195 --> 01:51:00.263
Yeah?

01:51:00.263 --> 01:51:01.097
No, they don't.
They don't...

01:51:01.097 --> 01:51:03.266
There's not...

01:51:03.266 --> 01:51:04.934
There's not much noise
around here, Selma,

01:51:04.934 --> 01:51:05.992
I know.

01:51:08.671 --> 01:51:11.774
But later they
turn on the radio.

01:51:11.774 --> 01:51:14.010
No, no, no.
There's no...

01:51:14.010 --> 01:51:17.070
They don't al low radio
in the isolation b lock.

01:51:18.180 --> 01:51:21.784
But I’ve been listening
to the ventilation...

01:51:21.784 --> 01:51:23.886
shaft.

01:51:23.886 --> 01:51:26.122
I hear sometimes
people singing there,

01:51:26.122 --> 01:51:28.391
like...

01:51:28.391 --> 01:51:29.551
hymns or...

01:51:30.860 --> 01:51:32.295
That's not
against the rules,

01:51:32.295 --> 01:51:34.195
to listen, is it?

01:51:35.865 --> 01:51:37.233
No.

01:51:37.233 --> 01:51:38.962
I wonder if...

01:51:40.536 --> 01:51:42.271
if maybe you're
hearing the singing

01:51:42.271 --> 01:51:43.806
coming from the chapel.

01:51:43.806 --> 01:51:44.966
Yeah?

01:51:47.777 --> 01:51:49.711
Maybe you’ll
even get a sermon.

01:55:44.647 --> 01:55:47.049
Selma...

01:55:47.049 --> 01:55:48.710
Selma...

01:55:49.919 --> 01:55:52.021
You got your stay.

01:55:52.021 --> 01:55:53.750
You got the stay.

01:55:56.659 --> 01:55:58.183
I'm so happy for you.

01:56:13.142 --> 01:56:15.077
I'm your new legal counsel.

01:56:15.077 --> 01:56:16.779
My name is Lu k e, okay?

01:56:16.779 --> 01:56:18.747
Oh, hi, Luke.

01:56:18.747 --> 01:56:21.750
I'm, uh, quite sure...

01:56:21.750 --> 01:56:23.581
I can get your sentence
commuted.

01:56:24.553 --> 01:56:26.155
All I need is a signature

01:56:26.155 --> 01:56:29.158
stating you want
the case re-opened...

01:56:29.158 --> 01:56:31.126
and then I can get
all the paperwork ready

01:56:31.126 --> 01:56:32.821
by tomorrow.

01:56:35.598 --> 01:56:36.799
Yeah.

01:56:36.799 --> 01:56:39.602
There's a lot of things
your other lawyer didn't do

01:56:39.602 --> 01:56:41.370
that I'm going to do.

01:56:41.370 --> 01:56:43.472
A lot of ground
that wasn't covered

01:56:43.472 --> 01:56:45.474
that I am going
to cover.

01:56:45.474 --> 01:56:47.676
The fact that you were
fighting for your boy

01:56:47.676 --> 01:56:49.645
is something
we can really mi I k.

01:56:49.645 --> 01:56:53.775
I have some experience
in cases like this, so...

01:56:54.850 --> 01:56:57.119
That's what
the attorney before said.

01:56:57.119 --> 01:56:58.177
Uh... yeah.

01:56:59.421 --> 01:57:03.392
You see, he was
appointed by the court,

01:57:03.392 --> 01:57:05.494
and you don't get
the best legal counsel

01:57:05.494 --> 01:57:06.595
that way.

01:57:06.595 --> 01:57:09.231
Y-You were not
appointed by the court?

01:57:09.231 --> 01:57:11.734
I'm not appointed
by the court, no.

01:57:11.734 --> 01:57:13.429
You're gonna have
to pay me.

01:57:17.239 --> 01:57:19.909
But... not to worry.

01:57:19.909 --> 01:57:20.910
Yeah?

01:57:20.910 --> 01:57:22.344
That's been
taken care of.

01:57:22.344 --> 01:57:25.314
I made a deal with
your... lady friend?

01:57:25.314 --> 01:57:26.515
Deal?

01:57:26.515 --> 01:57:29.585
Yeah, in regard
to my fee.

01:57:29.585 --> 01:57:31.887
I’ve agreed to
accept the amount

01:57:31.887 --> 01:57:34.355
that she said
she could raise.

01:57:43.832 --> 01:57:45.356
How much...

01:57:46.735 --> 01:57:48.137
How much was it?

01:57:48.137 --> 01:57:49.738
Well, I can tell you
precisely,

01:57:49.738 --> 01:57:50.973
because I received
an envelope.

01:57:50.973 --> 01:57:53.442
It's, uh,
two thousand dollars...

01:57:53.442 --> 01:57:57.680
$2, 056.10?

01:57:57.680 --> 01:57:59.705
That's it precisely.

01:58:01.750 --> 01:58:04.275
Now...

01:58:06.288 --> 01:58:08.586
There's something here.

01:58:10.125 --> 01:58:14.263
I'd like to just sort of
go over our tactics.

01:58:14.263 --> 01:58:16.966
I have a couple of
questions to ask you.

01:58:16.966 --> 01:58:18.867
If he doesn't have
the operation next month,

01:58:18.867 --> 01:58:20.302
it's gonna be too late!

01:58:20.302 --> 01:58:22.938
And he will never
be able to see!

01:58:22.938 --> 01:58:25.174
This is what
it's all about,

01:58:25.174 --> 01:58:26.909
so he can see
his grandchildren!

01:58:26.909 --> 01:58:29.111
Well, let me
tell you something.

01:58:29.111 --> 01:58:30.346
The only thing
that's important to me

01:58:30.346 --> 01:58:32.247
in my whole life,

01:58:32.247 --> 01:58:34.450
and you don't
understand, Kathy!

01:58:34.450 --> 01:58:36.085
- Listen to me!
- It's just plain stupidity!

01:58:36.085 --> 01:58:37.720
- Listen to me!
- Waste that kind of money...

01:58:37.720 --> 01:58:39.588
on a blind woman
who's gonna spend

01:58:39.588 --> 01:58:41.156
the rest of her life
in jail!

01:58:41.156 --> 01:58:42.558
But he needs his mother,
you know,

01:58:42.558 --> 01:58:43.559
alive,
no matter where!

01:58:43.559 --> 01:58:45.160
You don't understand!

01:58:45.160 --> 01:58:46.428
He needs his eyes!

01:58:46.428 --> 01:58:47.863
- He needs his mother!
- No!

01:58:47.863 --> 01:58:49.865
- Yes! Alive!
- No!

01:58:49.865 --> 01:58:51.700
Listen to reason
for once!

01:58:51.700 --> 01:58:52.997
Selma.

01:58:54.103 --> 01:58:55.204
Selma.

01:58:55.204 --> 01:58:57.106
I listen to my heart.

01:58:57.106 --> 01:58:59.441
I will go to the police.
I will tell them that...

01:58:59.441 --> 01:59:01.671
you stole the money
from... from Bill.

01:59:02.978 --> 01:59:04.346
Oh, yes,
I will tell that.

01:59:04.346 --> 01:59:06.348
I will
tell them that,

01:59:06.348 --> 01:59:07.716
that you stole it
from Bill,

01:59:07.716 --> 01:59:09.718
and you will never see
the money again!

01:59:09.718 --> 01:59:11.987
That will be gone
for good.

01:59:11.987 --> 01:59:15.320
No operation! Nothing!
No mother! Nothing!

01:59:24.666 --> 01:59:27.536
You can have
your money back.

01:59:27.536 --> 01:59:28.470
I just want
to make sure

01:59:28.470 --> 01:59:31.907
that you fully comprehend

01:59:31.907 --> 01:59:34.810
what this means,
this decision.

01:59:34.810 --> 01:59:35.811
Yeah.

01:59:35.811 --> 01:59:37.146
You fully realize
what will happen?

01:59:37.146 --> 01:59:38.247
Yeah.

01:59:38.247 --> 01:59:41.517
I al ready asked
for no more stays.

01:59:41.517 --> 01:59:43.419
Once this starts,
there's no stopping it.

01:59:43.419 --> 01:59:44.750
You understand me?

01:59:45.788 --> 01:59:47.085
Yeah.

01:59:48.991 --> 01:59:50.549
I'm prepared.

02:00:00.669 --> 02:00:02.864
Gene says thank you.

02:00:06.275 --> 02:00:08.072
Thanks for what?

02:00:12.047 --> 02:00:15.107
Oh, some comic books
on his birthday.

02:00:18.520 --> 02:00:21.590
You can't buy him...
presents

02:00:21.590 --> 02:00:24.760
and say it's from me.

02:00:24.760 --> 02:00:27.092
You have to stop
doing that, Jeff.

02:00:28.130 --> 02:00:30.724
Uh, maybe
you can just...

02:00:35.437 --> 02:00:37.132
phone him.

02:00:38.941 --> 02:00:42.144
Just say,
you know...

02:00:42.144 --> 02:00:43.745
something to him.

02:00:43.745 --> 02:00:46.077
No, that's... that's
not a good idea.

02:00:50.419 --> 02:00:53.252
He wants to be the one...

02:00:54.790 --> 02:00:57.850
who's al lowed to be there
when it happens.

02:01:01.230 --> 02:01:04.633
But I... And then
they told him

02:01:04.633 --> 02:01:06.066
he's too young.

02:01:09.037 --> 02:01:12.006
Who put that crazy idea
into his head anyway?

02:01:14.543 --> 02:01:16.067
I don't want him
to be there.

02:01:19.047 --> 02:01:20.912
I’ll be there
if you would.

02:01:23.051 --> 02:01:24.916
And Kathy?

02:01:30.926 --> 02:01:33.019
You know Kathy.
She's...

02:01:35.030 --> 02:01:36.793
She's still angry.

02:01:39.001 --> 02:01:41.561
If you think
you can take it...

02:01:44.573 --> 02:01:46.507
I would love you
to be there.

02:01:54.049 --> 02:01:56.818
Don't cry, Jeff.

02:01:56.818 --> 02:01:59.309
Jeff, don't cry.
It's gonna be fine.

02:02:01.590 --> 02:02:02.955
Jeff.

02:02:12.935 --> 02:02:14.766
Why did you have him?

02:02:16.438 --> 02:02:19.202
You knew he would have
the same disease as you.

02:02:29.518 --> 02:02:32.385
I just wanted to hold
a little baby...

02:02:36.925 --> 02:02:38.620
just in my arms.

02:02:45.701 --> 02:02:47.191
I love you.

02:03:19.301 --> 02:03:21.235
It's time, Selma.

02:03:47.963 --> 02:03:49.521
Okay?

02:03:52.501 --> 02:03:53.934
Okay.

02:05:14.049 --> 02:05:15.778
Your meal, Jezkova.

02:06:21.983 --> 02:06:24.386
Selma Jezkova...

02:06:24.386 --> 02:06:25.614
It's time.

02:06:44.573 --> 02:06:46.097
Please stand.

02:06:48.243 --> 02:06:50.143
She can walk on her own.

02:06:54.483 --> 02:06:56.618
Selma...

02:06:56.618 --> 02:07:00.522
I'm afraid my legs
aren't working very well.

02:07:00.522 --> 02:07:02.324
You can do it, Selma.

02:07:02.324 --> 02:07:03.391
Yeah.

02:07:03.391 --> 02:07:04.526
I have a plan, okay?

02:07:04.526 --> 02:07:05.720
Yeah.

02:07:07.195 --> 02:07:08.763
You're gonna
stand up with me.

02:07:08.763 --> 02:07:09.787
Yeah.

02:07:11.366 --> 02:07:12.526
I may make some noise.

02:07:14.769 --> 02:07:16.438
It will give you
something to listen to.

02:07:16.438 --> 02:07:17.339
Yeah.

02:07:17.339 --> 02:07:18.328
Listen.

02:07:23.979 --> 02:07:27.115
There's 107 steps.

02:07:27.115 --> 02:07:28.617
Selma, listen
to the mark.

02:07:28.617 --> 02:07:30.085
I couldn't even do one.

02:07:30.085 --> 02:07:31.319
You can do it.

02:07:31.319 --> 02:07:34.523
I can't do it!

02:07:34.523 --> 02:07:36.184
Now listen, Selma.

02:07:37.259 --> 02:07:39.693
I want you to do
one... there, one.

02:07:42.030 --> 02:07:43.965
Come on.

02:07:43.965 --> 02:07:45.125
Listen.

02:07:47.102 --> 02:07:48.364
Two.

02:07:50.071 --> 02:07:51.573
Three...

02:07:51.573 --> 02:07:52.574
four...

02:07:52.574 --> 02:07:55.010
five... six...

02:07:55.010 --> 02:07:56.912
seven... eight...

02:07:56.912 --> 02:07:58.947
nine... ten...

02:07:58.947 --> 02:08:02.083
11... 12... 13...

02:08:02.083 --> 02:08:04.052
14... 15...

02:08:04.052 --> 02:08:06.821
16... 17... 18...

02:08:06.821 --> 02:08:09.190
19... 20...

02:08:09.190 --> 02:08:11.660
21... 22... 23...

02:08:11.660 --> 02:08:14.029
24... 25...

02:08:14.029 --> 02:08:16.965
26... 27... 28...

02:08:16.965 --> 02:08:18.660
29... 30...

02:08:26.541 --> 02:08:28.372
39... 40...

02:08:31.012 --> 02:08:33.378
43... 44... 45...

02:08:43.358 --> 02:08:44.757
55... 56...

02:08:48.296 --> 02:08:50.491
60... 61... 62...

02:08:58.306 --> 02:09:00.774
70... 71... 72...

02:09:02.711 --> 02:09:06.078
75... 76... 77...

02:09:23.164 --> 02:09:25.428
93... 94... 95...

02:09:31.806 --> 02:09:34.109
104... 105...

02:09:34.109 --> 02:09:35.510
106...

02:09:35.510 --> 02:09:37.746
107.

02:09:37.746 --> 02:09:39.447
Selma Jezkova,

02:09:39.447 --> 02:09:40.914
do you have
any last words?

02:09:46.221 --> 02:09:47.950
Very well.
Proceed.

02:09:57.432 --> 02:09:58.956
Selma.

02:10:00.568 --> 02:10:02.331
Selma, you okay?

02:10:05.940 --> 02:10:07.168
It's okay.
It's okay.

02:10:11.146 --> 02:10:13.181
Come on now.

02:10:13.181 --> 02:10:14.349
Use the board.

02:10:14.349 --> 02:10:15.884
Oh, no, no. No, wait.
Give her a chance.

02:10:15.884 --> 02:10:17.579
She can stand up.
She can stand.

02:10:32.667 --> 02:10:33.635
In here.

02:10:33.635 --> 02:10:37.072
It's okay.
It's okay.

02:10:37.072 --> 02:10:38.573
It's okay.

02:10:38.573 --> 02:10:40.473
It's okay.

02:10:43.078 --> 02:10:45.113
It's okay.

02:10:45.113 --> 02:10:46.014
The straps
on her hands.

02:10:46.014 --> 02:10:47.282
I'm scared.

02:10:47.282 --> 02:10:48.450
It's okay.

02:10:48.450 --> 02:10:50.111
- I'm so scared!
- I know.

02:10:57.592 --> 02:10:58.957
On the mark.

02:11:07.635 --> 02:11:09.003
No!

02:11:09.003 --> 02:11:10.505
I can't do the hood!

02:11:10.505 --> 02:11:12.474
It's okay.
Selma.

02:11:12.474 --> 02:11:14.275
I have to breathe!

02:11:14.275 --> 02:11:16.044
Nobody told me
about the hood!

02:11:16.044 --> 02:11:18.079
It's just so
you can't see, Selma.

02:11:18.079 --> 02:11:19.514
- I can't breathe!
- I know.

02:11:19.514 --> 02:11:20.915
I can't breathe!

02:11:20.915 --> 02:11:22.684
- Look, look...
- I can't breathe!

02:11:22.684 --> 02:11:23.818
I have to breathe!

02:11:23.818 --> 02:11:24.512
Look,
she can't breathe.

02:11:25.587 --> 02:11:27.689
She can't breathe!
She can't...

02:11:27.689 --> 02:11:29.724
I'm taking it.
I'm taking it.

02:11:29.724 --> 02:11:31.726
This is irregular.

02:11:31.726 --> 02:11:33.495
I don't care
if it's irregular.

02:11:33.495 --> 02:11:34.562
- We have regulations.
- She's blind...

02:11:34.562 --> 02:11:36.264
I don't care about
the regulations!

02:11:36.264 --> 02:11:37.298
The girl is blind,
for Christ's sake.

02:11:37.298 --> 02:11:38.500
I'm gonna make a call.

02:11:38.500 --> 02:11:40.331
Yeah, make the call...

02:11:42.871 --> 02:11:43.905
Gene...

02:11:43.905 --> 02:11:46.141
Yeah, we
have a situation here.

02:11:46.141 --> 02:11:47.574
I’ll hold for him.

02:11:48.576 --> 02:11:49.644
Gene...

02:11:49.644 --> 02:11:51.146
The woman's blind...
I’ll wait.

02:11:51.146 --> 02:11:53.348
Gene...

02:11:53.348 --> 02:11:54.315
Gene...

02:11:56.484 --> 02:11:57.852
Waiting for a call.

02:11:57.852 --> 02:11:59.820
Gene...

02:12:08.463 --> 02:12:09.794
Gene!

02:12:09.998 --> 02:12:11.329
Gene!

02:12:14.469 --> 02:12:15.570
Gene!

02:12:15.570 --> 02:12:17.806
He... he's just outside.

02:12:17.806 --> 02:12:19.674
He gave me these
for you.

02:12:19.674 --> 02:12:21.109
Guard.

02:12:21.109 --> 02:12:22.744
So he had the operation?

02:12:22.744 --> 02:12:25.680
He will see
his grandchildren!

02:12:25.680 --> 02:12:27.341
He is just outside.

02:12:28.383 --> 02:12:29.645
You were right, Selma!
