WEBVTT

00:36.088 --> 00:37.589
Will you do my back?

00:41.301 --> 00:43.512
Whoa, Kelly, you're,
like, totally burning.

00:43.554 --> 00:45.055
Whatever. Color's color.

00:45.097 --> 00:48.016
Yeah, well, you won't be saying that
when you're all crying to me later.

00:49.101 --> 00:49.852
Carla, lean back.

00:49.893 --> 00:51.812
You're totally blocking my sun.

00:54.398 --> 00:55.691
Carla...

00:56.400 --> 00:57.901
What? What is it?

01:04.408 --> 01:06.118
Oh, my God.

02:12.392 --> 02:14.061
The victim's Ronnie Temple.

02:14.102 --> 02:15.687
He lived in Hialeah Gardens.

02:15.729 --> 02:17.314
Hialeah Gardens.

02:17.356 --> 02:18.899
So he was local.

02:20.484 --> 02:24.196
Alexx is on her way, but we don't
need her to see that he was garroted.

02:24.613 --> 02:26.573
Any witnesses?

02:26.615 --> 02:29.785
Couple dozen people hanging around
the pool, but nobody saw a thing.

02:29.910 --> 02:32.120
That's because they were watching...

02:32.412 --> 02:34.081
the eclipse.

02:34.206 --> 02:35.791
All eyes on the sky.

02:35.916 --> 02:37.793
I think the killer
counted on the distraction.

02:37.918 --> 02:40.587
But he didn't count on us.

03:28.621 --> 03:29.789
Hey, Calleigh!

03:33.292 --> 03:34.502
Okay...

03:34.585 --> 03:36.295
That's not your usual
passive-aggressive.

03:36.420 --> 03:37.797
Now that was aggressive-aggressive.

03:37.838 --> 03:39.090
Not now, Berkeley.

03:39.215 --> 03:40.800
I know that tone.

03:41.008 --> 03:44.095
I mean, us taking a break
was a mutual thing, right?

03:44.220 --> 03:45.054
It was.

03:45.096 --> 03:45.888
It is.

03:46.222 --> 03:47.515
Hey, Alexx!

03:47.556 --> 03:48.808
Look...

03:48.891 --> 03:51.268
I just want to be put on record:

03:51.310 --> 03:57.108
This, right here, this is some bad mojo.

03:59.485 --> 04:00.986
How do you figure?

04:01.112 --> 04:05.700
My grandmother was into
astrology, and the saying goes:

04:05.741 --> 04:08.661
If someone dies during an eclipse,

04:08.703 --> 04:14.500
they can't rest until they
take another soul with them.

04:16.293 --> 04:17.503
That's ridiculous.

04:17.586 --> 04:18.587
Hey...

04:19.296 --> 04:21.423
I'm going to do my job...

04:21.589 --> 04:26.303
but mojo is mojo, honey.

04:27.596 --> 04:28.681
Just ignore him, Alexx.

04:28.723 --> 04:31.600
He takes everything at face value.

04:35.396 --> 04:37.690
Well, call me if you get anything.

04:38.190 --> 04:40.609
If you still remember the number.

04:41.694 --> 04:45.114
I heard you two had to break
up because of department rules.

04:45.698 --> 04:47.199
That's the story.

04:47.324 --> 04:49.285
Speaking of stories, I heard
on the radio this morning

04:49.410 --> 04:53.998
that there had not been a total
eclipse in Miami since the year 1637.

04:54.123 --> 04:55.916
The path of totality.

04:56.709 --> 05:01.005
It's the one time when God
Himself looks the other way.

05:01.047 --> 05:05.301
I don't know this side of
you, Alexx, but I like it.

05:08.012 --> 05:09.680
Hey, check out this little metal case.

05:09.722 --> 05:12.308
It seems out of place at
a pool, don't you think?

05:12.349 --> 05:13.559
And it's empty.

05:13.601 --> 05:15.561
Looks like someone had a go at it.

05:15.603 --> 05:18.314
They probably left me
some nice epithelials.

05:18.397 --> 05:21.317
I wonder if the contents
were worth killing over?

05:31.410 --> 05:34.497
I just ran the swabs Calleigh got
from the metal case at the scene,

05:34.538 --> 05:37.792
and they were a match to a
known felon: Mario Montero.

05:37.833 --> 05:40.002
He's in the system for
two aggravated assaults.

05:40.086 --> 05:41.420
That's great. I'm going
to have him picked up.

05:41.504 --> 05:42.922
Perfect.

05:43.422 --> 05:45.424
Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

05:45.508 --> 05:46.717
What is this?

05:46.759 --> 05:47.259
This...

05:47.301 --> 05:49.970
well... this can't be right.

05:50.012 --> 05:52.515
Look at this-
check out his DNA.

05:53.224 --> 05:56.310
16 markers, two peaks per.

05:56.394 --> 05:57.603
I don't know- it
looks normal to me.

05:57.645 --> 05:59.814
ten alles apiece.

05:59.897 --> 06:02.316
But then look at the last six.

06:02.400 --> 06:04.151
They'rewayoutside the variant.

06:04.193 --> 06:07.696
And that last peak is so low
that it barely even registers.

06:07.738 --> 06:08.489
I don't know; you got me.

06:08.531 --> 06:09.573
What?

06:09.615 --> 06:10.449
Well, they...

06:10.491 --> 06:12.618
don't register as human.

06:15.913 --> 06:17.415
What do you mean?

06:17.456 --> 06:18.874
His DNA is mutating.

06:18.916 --> 06:22.712
These peaks mic a
specific canine profile.

06:22.753 --> 06:24.213
Canine, like a dog.

06:24.255 --> 06:25.589
Like a wolf.

06:26.090 --> 06:27.675
A wolf!

06:27.717 --> 06:32.221
Okay, well, I guess I'm going
to need a leash to bring him in.

06:34.098 --> 06:35.599
Thanks.

06:39.103 --> 06:42.189
Evidence puts you at
the scene of a homicide.

06:42.314 --> 06:45.484
Ronnie Temple from the
Woolrich Hotel pool.

06:45.609 --> 06:48.320
Yeah, I was there.

06:48.404 --> 06:49.363
So?

06:49.405 --> 06:50.614
Saw him all bloody and whatnot.

06:50.698 --> 06:52.700
I just snaked all of his stuff.

07:04.712 --> 07:06.589
What were you looking for?

07:06.714 --> 07:08.924
Wolf hormones.

07:09.508 --> 07:10.676
Come on.

07:10.718 --> 07:12.344
Wolf hormones?

07:12.386 --> 07:17.224
80 years ago, no one ever thought
they could turn a dude into a chick.

07:20.811 --> 07:24.690
And, uh, Ronnie Temple used
to sell you all this stuff?

07:24.732 --> 07:26.567
Temple was the go-to guy.

07:26.609 --> 07:29.904
Anything you could eat,
snort, smoke, shoot.

07:29.945 --> 07:31.697
Dealt out of that cabana.

07:32.990 --> 07:36.786
I gotta ask-
why a wolf?

07:36.911 --> 07:39.121
That's my destiny.

07:39.205 --> 07:40.790
That's why.

07:42.708 --> 07:46.796
Werewolves, man, they're
outlaws... warriors.

07:46.837 --> 07:51.384
In other words... killers

07:54.512 --> 07:59.809
If I'd killed him, it'd went
down way different, tell you that.

08:02.019 --> 08:05.898
Wouldn't even have been
enough left of him to identify.

08:08.192 --> 08:11.195
That's not exactly the best way to
convince me to let you out of here.

08:11.237 --> 08:14.198
If you could pinch me for murder,
you'd have done it already.

08:14.323 --> 08:16.909
I guess I'll have to
settle for theft for now.

08:16.992 --> 08:20.121
And I want everything back
that you took from that cabana.

08:20.287 --> 08:21.789
Everything.

08:30.423 --> 08:33.008
Is that the stuff that Mario stole?

08:33.092 --> 08:34.467
You mean the wolf man?

08:34.510 --> 08:39.097
Yeah, this is it- everything that he
scavenged from Ronnie Temple's briefcase.

08:40.515 --> 08:43.394
I guess Montero wasn't lying.

08:43.436 --> 08:46.313
Embryonic hormones: Canis Lupus.

08:46.355 --> 08:48.315
He injects wolf hormones?

08:48.357 --> 08:49.191
Why?

08:49.316 --> 08:52.111
The guy want to turn
himself into a wolf.

08:52.194 --> 08:53.779
Well, Mario made bail.

08:53.821 --> 08:56.157
And he's gotten a big
firm to represent him.

08:56.198 --> 09:00.786
Lawyers, vampires and werewolves-
they all run in the same circles.

09:03.706 --> 09:07.418
You're still angry with me
about the thing with Jake, right?

09:07.710 --> 09:09.795
No, I'm not.

09:10.296 --> 09:12.214
You know what, it...

09:12.423 --> 09:14.216
it probably would've
gotten out eventually,

09:14.300 --> 09:15.593
even if you hadn't have told Stetler,

09:15.718 --> 09:18.387
and you probably just
sped up the inevitable.

09:18.512 --> 09:23.100
If it would've been me, I would've
transferred to the night shift.

09:25.895 --> 09:27.688
That's sweet.

09:31.609 --> 09:34.070
Check this out- it may
be the victim's blood.

09:34.111 --> 09:36.989
And look at the frayed edge-
it's not from the name card.

09:37.031 --> 09:39.742
That's an employee ID
from the Woolrich Hotel.

09:39.784 --> 09:42.286
Frayed thread's probably from
the lanyard he ripped it off of.

09:42.411 --> 09:43.746
Lanyard, cord, string

09:43.788 --> 09:47.416
whatever it was, it would've been
something good to strangle someone with.

09:56.801 --> 09:58.844
Does it say who the card belongs to?

09:58.886 --> 10:00.888
No. It's got an employee ID number.

10:00.930 --> 10:03.891
"51395."

10:06.394 --> 10:08.979
Shawn, you're a pool boy
at the Woolrich Hotel,

10:09.021 --> 10:13.484
and we recovered your employee
badge at our victim's body.

10:13.526 --> 10:15.820
Someone broke into my
locker, took my badge.

10:24.286 --> 10:27.123
Why don't you show him
your hands here, sport?

10:35.506 --> 10:36.966
It's not what you think.

10:37.007 --> 10:38.551
It happened on the job this morning.

10:38.592 --> 10:41.262
I think you've hit your quota
of cockamamy excuses today.

10:41.303 --> 10:43.889
I cut myself when I was
putting out the lounge chairs.

10:49.311 --> 10:52.815
We'll verify that if we have
to turn over every chair.

10:52.898 --> 10:54.024
Be my guest.

10:54.108 --> 10:56.360
What reason could I possibly
have to kill the guy?

10:56.402 --> 10:58.988
Well, the victim was dealing
drugs out of one of your cabanas.

10:59.030 --> 11:00.614
Maybe he didn't cut you in.

11:03.117 --> 11:05.036
I didn't care what the
guy did, to be honest.

11:05.077 --> 11:06.954
I just didn't want
to be on his bad side.

11:06.996 --> 11:10.416
You don't want to be on mine,
either, I can assure you.

11:10.458 --> 11:11.709
You have to believe me.

11:11.751 --> 11:12.376
I'm innocent.

11:12.418 --> 11:16.213
Mr. Hodges, I don't
have to believe anything.

11:35.191 --> 11:40.279
Case number 0792134.

11:40.321 --> 11:43.115
Victim's name is Ronnie Temple.

11:43.157 --> 11:45.910
Male Caucasian, 30 years old.

11:45.951 --> 11:48.454
Apparent homicide by a ligature.

11:48.496 --> 11:52.416
Body was found in the
cabana of the Woolrich Hotel.

11:52.708 --> 11:56.712
A deep furrow stretches
across the anterior neck,

11:56.796 --> 12:01.801
crossing just below the
laryngeal prominence.

12:04.720 --> 12:10.184
Seems to be something
stuck in the wound.

12:12.186 --> 12:14.605
Looks like hair.

12:15.898 --> 12:17.983
Noted.

12:18.401 --> 12:21.696
Could belong to his assailant.

12:22.113 --> 12:26.909
Now going to begin the Y incision.

13:03.964 --> 13:05.382
Alexx!

13:05.466 --> 13:08.052
Alexx, guess who just got reinstated!

13:10.179 --> 13:11.555
Alexx?

13:14.850 --> 13:15.768
Alexx?

13:15.851 --> 13:17.561
Alexx, can you hear me?

13:19.647 --> 13:21.065
Alexx, hold on. Hold on.

13:21.148 --> 13:21.982
This is Ryan Wolfe.

13:22.066 --> 13:25.069
I need paramedics in
the autopsy room, now.

13:25.653 --> 13:27.071
Alexx!

13:46.256 --> 13:47.675
Alexx's doctor called.

13:47.758 --> 13:49.468
and she's regained consciousness.

13:49.551 --> 13:51.387
CT scan came up normal.

13:51.470 --> 13:53.180
Doesn't seem to be any internal cause.

13:53.222 --> 13:54.556
So it was environmental.

13:54.682 --> 13:57.184
You'd think, but
HAZMAT cleared the room.

13:57.267 --> 13:59.770
There's nothing showing
up on the MiniRAE.

14:01.480 --> 14:03.357
I don't know, maybe Alexx is right.

14:03.482 --> 14:04.775
About what?

14:04.858 --> 14:08.654
The eclipse and somebody
dying during an eclipse.

14:08.696 --> 14:12.449
They don't rest until they
take someone else's soul?

14:20.749 --> 14:22.751
I think we found our other soul.

14:22.793 --> 14:25.254
Ligature marks are similar.

14:31.677 --> 14:33.470
So, Eric...

14:33.554 --> 14:35.097
we've got another victim.

14:35.139 --> 14:36.640
Yeah, her name's Diana Long.

14:36.682 --> 14:38.517
23 years old, she was
killed in her apartment.

14:38.559 --> 14:40.352
Called it in late last
night after midnight.

14:40.477 --> 14:41.603
Night shift processed her?

14:41.645 --> 14:44.273
Yeah, and the scene- no way to
tell there was a pattern until now.

14:44.315 --> 14:46.525
Two murders, 12 hours, right?

14:46.567 --> 14:48.986
Both strangled within
five miles of each other.

14:49.069 --> 14:50.654
Anything else to connect the victims?

14:50.779 --> 14:53.073
Jake's doing background
checks as we speak.

14:53.157 --> 14:54.950
I think we're dealing
with a serial killer, H.

14:55.075 --> 14:56.452
So do I.

15:03.584 --> 15:04.960
Hello?

15:12.176 --> 15:14.011
We get the full report from night shift?

15:14.053 --> 15:18.349
She lived alone, didn't work, and
nobody even came to claim the body.

15:18.474 --> 15:19.850
All right, well...

15:19.975 --> 15:23.228
there's something I need to say
to you, so just let me say it.

15:23.270 --> 15:25.648
The thing with you and Calleigh,
Stetler- I never meant for that...

15:25.689 --> 15:26.732
Save it.

15:26.774 --> 15:29.485
She's obviously not too bothered by it.

15:29.526 --> 15:32.363
Means, I'm not too bothered by it.

15:33.155 --> 15:34.782
Good.

15:44.958 --> 15:47.878
You know, I'm beginning to understand
why Diana Long didn't have any friends.

15:47.920 --> 15:52.049
Got take-out menus,
catalogs, a mini-fridge.

15:52.091 --> 15:53.717
Take a look at this.

15:53.759 --> 15:56.261
See how deep that wear pattern is?

15:56.303 --> 15:58.764
Spent a ton of time in this chair.

15:58.847 --> 16:01.725
So she was living her
life on the computer.

16:01.767 --> 16:05.145
She's got a screensaver of the beach when
the real thing's right outside her window.

16:05.187 --> 16:06.772
Yeah, I'm going to take it to AV.

16:06.814 --> 16:08.357
There could be something on it.

16:09.274 --> 16:13.278
She's got no roommates, no friends...

16:14.363 --> 16:15.781
Who discovered the body?

16:15.864 --> 16:18.367
It was a delivery guy.

16:18.409 --> 16:19.910
Clint Gilmore.

16:19.952 --> 16:23.163
He hung around for questioning,
had all the right answers.

16:23.205 --> 16:25.958
Maybe he wasn't being
asked the right questions.

16:28.585 --> 16:29.920
So, Clint...

16:29.962 --> 16:33.465
it was you who discovered
Diana Long's body.

16:33.507 --> 16:37.261
I told the other officers that already.

16:37.386 --> 16:39.763
I don't know what more you want from me.

16:39.805 --> 16:42.057
How about the truth?

16:43.183 --> 16:44.685
Okay.

16:44.768 --> 16:46.145
My name is Clint Gilmore.

16:46.228 --> 16:47.563
I work for Takeln Delivery.

16:47.646 --> 16:49.356
Whatever you need, we bring to you.

16:49.398 --> 16:51.066
We're number one in Miami for a reason.

16:51.150 --> 16:52.818
So Diana was a customer.

16:52.860 --> 16:54.945
Yes, she was one of my best clients.

16:54.987 --> 16:57.072
Every single night she need something.

16:57.114 --> 16:59.950
Bread, toothpaste, diet soda...

17:00.659 --> 17:04.371
Even once- I
swear- a snare drum.

17:04.954 --> 17:06.665
So you knew her pretty well.

17:06.707 --> 17:08.375
No, I didn't know her at all.

17:09.585 --> 17:12.171
I had never even spoke with the woman.

17:12.212 --> 17:14.714
She'd just leave her door unlocked,

17:14.757 --> 17:18.551
d leave money on a side table
so she wouldn't have to get up.

17:18.676 --> 17:22.765
It was like she was
living under quarantine.

17:22.806 --> 17:25.476
What was the last order she placed?

17:25.559 --> 17:28.270
Uh... food for two.

17:28.771 --> 17:35.152
But when I got there, I opened the
door, the money wasn't on the table.

17:42.951 --> 17:45.245
And you know what's weird, Lieutenant?

17:45.287 --> 17:46.622
What is that?

17:46.664 --> 17:50.876
That was the only time
I ever saw her face.

17:51.460 --> 17:53.879
Did you ever see her guest?

17:54.046 --> 17:55.881
Sorry, but no.

17:57.049 --> 17:59.051
I hope you catch this guy.

17:59.176 --> 18:00.552
I will, Clint.

18:00.678 --> 18:02.346
I will.

18:12.147 --> 18:14.274
That's a nice upgrade.

18:14.650 --> 18:15.859
The, uh, hardware, I meant.

18:15.985 --> 18:18.445
Not that you're not very, um...

18:18.779 --> 18:19.613
Let's just start this over again.

18:19.655 --> 18:21.865
My name's Ryan Wolfe,
and I was just reinstated.

18:21.907 --> 18:22.866
I know who you are.

18:22.908 --> 18:23.951
Samantha.

18:24.076 --> 18:26.954
So this is Diana
Long's desktop computer?

18:26.996 --> 18:28.372
More like her lifeline.

18:28.455 --> 18:30.958
There's an icon for
absolutely everything.

18:31.000 --> 18:32.668
Well, it's modern living, I guess.

18:32.751 --> 18:35.629
If you call being a mouse
potato living, sure, I guess so.

18:35.671 --> 18:39.675
Says the girl who gets her paycheck from
standing in front of a computer screen all day.

18:39.717 --> 18:42.136
Wow, first day back and
you're already feisty.

18:42.177 --> 18:45.973
So can you tell me if Diana had any, uh,
communications with anyone last night?

18:46.056 --> 18:47.975
Sure, let me look at
her instant messages.

18:48.058 --> 18:49.977
They're all archived.

18:50.853 --> 18:51.437
Here we go

18:51.478 --> 18:52.938
she went by the name WRLDTRVLER

18:52.980 --> 18:56.567
and chatted with someone
going by LIONCASH88.

19:07.661 --> 19:09.455
What's their last exchange?

19:09.580 --> 19:12.124
LIONCASH88 said, "We should meet, "

19:12.166 --> 19:14.960
and she said, "Kind
of busy, I don't know. "

19:15.085 --> 19:17.254
Her last words were sent at 11:30 p. m.

19:17.296 --> 19:19.757
And she died shortly after that.

19:21.467 --> 19:24.011
Can you get an identity
for Mr. LIONCASH88?

19:24.053 --> 19:28.182
Sure, I can run a reverse
trace on the IP address.

19:30.351 --> 19:33.479
Looks like your gentleman caller's
real name is Nicholas Pike.

19:33.562 --> 19:35.147
Think she rejected him?

19:35.481 --> 19:39.777
Well, if she did, why did
she order food for two?

19:50.663 --> 19:53.082
You got quite a place here, Mr. Pike.

19:53.165 --> 19:54.667
Thank you.

19:54.875 --> 19:57.461
The nightclub business
has been good to me.

19:57.586 --> 20:03.759
You know what they say, bring in
the ladies, the men always follow.

20:03.968 --> 20:06.178
Actually, I'm interested
in just one lady.

20:06.261 --> 20:07.471
Her name is Diana Long.

20:07.554 --> 20:09.682
Does that sound familiar?

20:09.974 --> 20:12.559
Not off hand, no.

20:12.685 --> 20:15.354
Maybe her screen name does: WRLDTRVLER.

20:15.396 --> 20:18.065
Oh, yeah. Sure. We met in a chat room.

20:18.107 --> 20:20.275
Um, very nice to talk to.

20:20.317 --> 20:21.819
We hit it off.

20:21.860 --> 20:25.781
Different from all the
models-slash-actresses that I'm used to.

20:25.864 --> 20:27.574
How about in person?

20:27.658 --> 20:29.034
We never met in person.

20:29.076 --> 20:33.080
It appears that you two had dinner
last night before her murder.

20:33.163 --> 20:34.373
Murder?

20:35.457 --> 20:37.376
Look, uh...

20:37.459 --> 20:40.254
We were supposed to
hook up last night...

20:48.554 --> 20:50.556
but she backed out on me.

20:50.681 --> 20:54.184
Um... I never even got her address.

20:54.476 --> 20:57.855
What did you do immediately
after you got off the computer?

20:57.980 --> 20:58.814
Went to work.

20:58.856 --> 21:00.607
Had some VIPs to entertain.

21:00.649 --> 21:03.152
Late night is when things
really start to heat up.

21:03.193 --> 21:05.321
Can anyone verify that?

21:05.362 --> 21:08.073
About a thousand people in the club.

21:08.782 --> 21:10.534
I'm really sorry I
can't be of more help,

21:10.576 --> 21:13.662
but be sure to let me know if
there's anything else I can do.

21:13.704 --> 21:15.164
I'll do that.

21:19.376 --> 21:20.461
Hey, look who's back.

21:20.586 --> 21:22.004
There's my hero.

21:22.046 --> 21:23.964
Did you get a nice homecoming, baby?

21:24.048 --> 21:24.965
Hey, I don't want to talk about that.

21:25.049 --> 21:26.967
You know what I want to talk about?

21:27.009 --> 21:28.427
What happened to you?

21:28.469 --> 21:30.179
He is what happened to me.

21:30.262 --> 21:31.513
Ronnie Temple.

21:31.555 --> 21:32.765
Our drug dealer.

21:32.848 --> 21:36.143
Apparently, he took them, too.

21:36.185 --> 21:40.230
His coffin nail of
choice- crystal meth.

21:40.272 --> 21:42.358
So that explains why the
stomach looks like that.

21:42.483 --> 21:44.652
This is what knocked me out.

21:44.777 --> 21:49.573
Crystal meth is cut with ammonia,
drain cleaner, even chloroform.

21:49.615 --> 21:53.077
Massive use can cause a
build up of phosphine gas.

21:53.118 --> 21:56.538
I would think that the gas
would dissipate over time.

21:56.580 --> 22:02.086
Well, yeah, if somebody doesn't kill you
before your body has a chance to absorb it.

22:14.181 --> 22:16.058
You know the hair I
found in his neck wound?

22:16.183 --> 22:17.977
Did you ever figure out
who that belonged to?

22:18.018 --> 22:19.186
What hair?

22:19.228 --> 22:20.354
Wait a minute.

22:20.479 --> 22:23.273
I bagged it and I put it on the tray.

22:33.575 --> 22:35.119
I got it.

22:35.160 --> 22:37.663
So you said this is from the wound?

22:38.580 --> 22:40.249
There's no skin tag, Alexx.

22:40.291 --> 22:41.959
Oh, no, so there's no DNA?

22:42.001 --> 22:43.127
That's all right.

22:43.168 --> 22:45.879
It's short and it's coarse.

22:45.921 --> 22:48.549
And the color's banded.

22:48.674 --> 22:51.176
I'm guessing that it's
probably from a dog.

22:51.260 --> 22:53.679
Do any of your suspects have a dog?

22:53.762 --> 22:54.430
None that I know of.

22:54.471 --> 22:57.266
But there's one that
we suspect might be...

22:58.684 --> 23:00.561
part canine.

23:14.366 --> 23:16.076
Got blood on the door.

23:18.370 --> 23:19.955
Mario Montero.

23:20.080 --> 23:21.206
It's MDPD.

23:21.248 --> 23:22.875
We have a warrant to
search the premises.

23:22.916 --> 23:24.251
We're coming in.

23:27.171 --> 23:28.756
Montero.

23:33.260 --> 23:34.053
What the hell is that?

23:34.178 --> 23:36.180
- stay behind me
- okay

23:59.662 --> 24:01.455
Thank God you're here.

24:02.164 --> 24:04.375
Somebody just tried to kill me.

24:17.756 --> 24:19.633
Guy came out of nowhere.

24:19.758 --> 24:21.843
Lucky I had protection.

24:36.358 --> 24:38.568
I hit the ground, played dead.

24:38.652 --> 24:40.153
Played dead?

24:40.362 --> 24:42.864
What happened to the outlaw warrior?

24:42.906 --> 24:44.449
Hey, man, I'm alive.

24:44.533 --> 24:45.742
Did you see his face?

24:45.784 --> 24:46.702
No.

24:46.743 --> 24:48.453
Just heard him scramble to get out.

24:48.537 --> 24:50.122
Maybe that's his blood on the door.

24:50.163 --> 24:52.457
Yeah, that's the killer's first mistake.

24:52.541 --> 24:54.459
Let's make it his last.

24:54.543 --> 24:56.628
Let's get that blood over to the lab.

25:12.144 --> 25:16.356
Shawn, sometimes a killer
will leave a calling card.

25:16.857 --> 25:17.607
What are you talking about?

25:17.649 --> 25:20.235
We recovered your blood
from the second crime scene.

25:20.277 --> 25:22.738
And that's two in two days.

25:47.637 --> 25:48.388
I
- I don't know what to say.

25:48.430 --> 25:51.141
So we have the missing
lanyard from your locker,

25:51.183 --> 25:53.852
the cuts on your hands
and now the blood, Shawn.

25:57.731 --> 25:58.940
Look, I know it sounds crazy.

25:58.982 --> 26:00.150
But I can't explain it, okay?

26:00.192 --> 26:02.069
I can't.

26:06.531 --> 26:08.033
Am I going to need a lawyer?

26:08.075 --> 26:09.951
Immediately.

26:16.041 --> 26:18.960
What do you mean Horatio
thinks the pool boy is innocent?

26:19.044 --> 26:21.338
Yeah, he thinks it's possible
Hodges is being framed,

26:21.463 --> 26:24.049
so I dug up one of his coworkers.

26:24.466 --> 26:26.551
Verified his locker was broken into.

26:26.635 --> 26:28.929
So someone could have stolen
the lanyard with his ID badge.

26:28.970 --> 26:29.930
Yeah.

26:30.055 --> 26:31.515
Let me ask you something, Frank.

26:31.556 --> 26:35.644
Do you believe in all of this,
you know, eclipse affecting people?

26:35.686 --> 26:37.896
No, I don't believe
in that hocus-pocus.

26:37.938 --> 26:41.441
It is what it is, it ain't what it
ain't, don't make it what it isn't.

26:41.483 --> 26:42.859
Okay.

26:45.362 --> 26:46.488
Oh, look here.

26:46.530 --> 26:50.867
Just found a puncture hole in
the metal with some blood on it.

26:50.909 --> 26:52.661
There's one on this side, too.

26:52.703 --> 26:54.454
Where Hodges would grab it.

27:15.434 --> 27:16.727
Little bugger's telling the truth.

27:16.810 --> 27:18.061
So someone was trying to set him up.

27:18.145 --> 27:21.231
And that means that the person could
have stolen a sample of Hodges blood

27:21.273 --> 27:24.651
and then planted it in
Mario Montero's apartment.

27:27.362 --> 27:29.531
So he could get off scot-free.

27:29.573 --> 27:31.658
Or maybe not.

27:31.867 --> 27:34.536
Found a little bit of
trace on this chair.

27:38.540 --> 27:41.168
I'll get this sample over to Trace.

27:48.550 --> 27:50.135
That's odd.

27:50.635 --> 27:51.511
What is it?

27:51.553 --> 27:55.140
The trace Natalia found on the
lounge chair is a topical cream.

27:55.182 --> 27:55.807
Suntan lotion?

27:55.849 --> 27:58.143
That's hardly out of
place on a pool chair.

27:58.185 --> 27:59.102
No, it's stronger than that.

27:59.144 --> 28:02.356
It's a medication for people
with polymorphic light eruption.

28:02.397 --> 28:04.024
- Photoxicity?
- Exactly.

28:04.066 --> 28:05.609
An allergy to the sun.

28:05.650 --> 28:09.029
You know, in extreme cases, even a few
minutes can cause a person to blister,

28:09.071 --> 28:10.405
or breakout in hives,

28:10.447 --> 28:12.616
you know, even get
a second-degree burn.

28:12.658 --> 28:14.868
Well, that definitely
rules out Shawn Hodges.

28:14.910 --> 28:17.663
I mean, he works out in the sun all day.

28:17.746 --> 28:19.414
What are we not seeing?

28:19.456 --> 28:23.043
And you say that I take
everything at face value.

28:24.544 --> 28:27.047
Think outside the science for a minute.

28:27.130 --> 28:28.799
Twice this killer struck at night.

28:28.840 --> 28:30.592
And the other time, it
was during an eclipse.

28:30.634 --> 28:34.262
The only time he can go out
without risking sun exposure.

28:34.304 --> 28:36.014
What about Nicholas Pike?

28:36.056 --> 28:38.433
The guy who met Diana Long online.

28:38.558 --> 28:39.643
He's a nightclub owner.

28:39.768 --> 28:40.894
Which makes him a night owl.

28:40.936 --> 28:42.646
Judge isn't going to give
us a warrant based on that,

28:42.688 --> 28:44.648
though, so, how do we get him?

28:44.731 --> 28:46.400
Well, you know, it's a nice sunny day.

28:46.441 --> 28:49.653
Why don't we invite him
outside and see if he shows?

29:04.251 --> 29:05.127
Mr. Pike.

29:05.168 --> 29:06.628
Lieutenant Caine.

29:06.753 --> 29:08.338
Thank you for coming in.

29:08.463 --> 29:10.966
We neglected to get a sample from
you at the house the other day.

29:11.008 --> 29:13.552
We'd like to do that
today if it would be okay.

29:13.593 --> 29:14.094
No problem.

29:14.136 --> 29:15.554
What do you need, fingerprints?

29:15.595 --> 29:16.221
Something like that.

29:16.263 --> 29:18.765
Would you step out of the car, please.

29:29.151 --> 29:33.238
Mr. Pike, this officer will escort you
inside, and I appreciate your help today.

29:33.280 --> 29:34.197
Thank you.

29:34.239 --> 29:36.366
My absolute pleasure.

29:54.978 --> 29:55.646
Calleigh.

29:55.687 --> 29:58.190
I just talked to Eric and he said
it's a no-go on Nicholas Pike.

29:58.231 --> 30:01.193
Well, swabs came back negative
for photoxicity medication.

30:01.234 --> 30:02.986
Not even a suntan lotion.

30:03.028 --> 30:03.445
Great.

30:03.487 --> 30:04.613
So what now?

30:04.696 --> 30:06.239
Well, I'm going to head
over to the evidence locker.

30:06.281 --> 30:09.993
Night shift has turned in all their
evidence on the Diana Long murder, so.

30:10.035 --> 30:11.411
So, what do you want from me?

30:11.495 --> 30:13.747
Diana Long was on the computer
all the time, wasn't she?

30:13.789 --> 30:16.583
Yeah. Samantha's still trying to
pull everything up off her hard drive.

30:16.625 --> 30:18.502
Check in with her, would you?
See if anything jumps out at you.

30:18.585 --> 30:20.504
Okay. I'll see you in a few.

30:51.201 --> 30:53.203
That is wolf hair.

30:53.245 --> 30:54.413
What?

30:55.080 --> 30:55.789
Really?

30:55.914 --> 30:56.999
How do you know?

30:57.082 --> 30:58.709
Because I met the wolf.

30:58.750 --> 31:00.294
Up close and personal.

31:00.335 --> 31:02.087
It's Mario Montero's pet.

31:03.714 --> 31:04.756
Okay.

31:04.798 --> 31:08.302
So Mario got his wolf's hair on
him, and then shed it at not one,

31:08.343 --> 31:10.512
but two different crime scenes.

31:15.600 --> 31:18.312
That makes sense because guess who
she's been on the Internet with?

31:18.353 --> 31:20.939
It's Mario Montero, our wolf boy.

31:20.981 --> 31:24.109
And they've been chatting online
together four to five hours a day.

31:24.151 --> 31:26.778
So Mario was just as chained
to his computer as Diana was.

31:26.820 --> 31:29.281
So playing the victim was just an act?

31:29.323 --> 31:31.700
That's what we're going to find out.

31:32.409 --> 31:34.411
You know Diana Long?

31:34.494 --> 31:36.913
Wait, uh... Diana?

31:36.997 --> 31:38.999
We know you had a relationship with her.

31:40.208 --> 31:44.087
Well, we had sex, yes.

31:44.212 --> 31:45.297
But only online.

31:45.339 --> 31:46.340
Never in person.

31:46.381 --> 31:49.885
Then why did we find another one
of your wolf hairs at her home?

31:52.387 --> 31:54.014
One time, she let her last name slip.

31:54.097 --> 31:55.182
Thought I'd look her up.

31:55.307 --> 31:57.392
See if she was all that.

32:06.777 --> 32:08.403
You actually are good looking.

32:08.445 --> 32:09.988
I'm sorry. Can I help you?

32:10.030 --> 32:11.114
It's me, Diana.

32:11.156 --> 32:12.282
Mario.

32:13.283 --> 32:15.911
MOONDOG34.

32:16.078 --> 32:18.288
What do you say we
finish what we started?

32:18.330 --> 32:20.707
I'm sorry, you have to leave.

32:23.710 --> 32:26.088
She was fun online.

32:26.213 --> 32:29.800
In real life, forget it.

32:30.509 --> 32:32.094
Can I go now?

32:32.177 --> 32:34.304
No, not quite.

32:34.805 --> 32:38.684
The killer has an allergy to the
sun and uses prescription sunscreen.

32:38.725 --> 32:41.812
And the swab will tell us if it's you.

32:41.853 --> 32:44.606
Well, then, swab away.

32:54.491 --> 32:55.909
Hey, Calleigh.

32:56.785 --> 32:58.662
So wolf man's clean.

32:58.704 --> 33:00.372
No medication on his skin.

33:00.414 --> 33:02.499
Man, we went through his
entire apartment, too.

33:02.582 --> 33:03.834
There's no weapon, nothing.

33:03.875 --> 33:08.005
Yeah, well, how are we going to possibly
tie our killer to all of his victims?

33:08.046 --> 33:10.882
Okay, well, Mario and Diana were
on the computer all the time,

33:10.924 --> 33:13.176
Ronnie was at the cabana selling drugs.

33:13.302 --> 33:18.390
It's like he knew their habits, their
vulnerabilities and when to strike.

33:20.684 --> 33:22.185
There's only one way that's possible.

33:22.311 --> 33:24.104
He was watching them.

33:54.509 --> 33:58.180
location: mario montero's apartment

34:18.699 --> 34:19.701
Sam.

34:19.784 --> 34:21.995
Well, we know our killer may
have been spying on his victims.

34:22.036 --> 34:24.748
I've taken all the photos
from the three crime scenes

34:24.790 --> 34:27.501
and created panoramic views
of the outside environments.

34:27.542 --> 34:30.212
And it stands to reason if the
killer could see his victims,

34:30.253 --> 34:32.130
it's possible they could see him.

34:32.172 --> 34:34.007
Yes, 'cause of line of sight.

34:34.091 --> 34:38.679
If I superimpose the panoramas
over each other, I get this.

34:39.804 --> 34:43.100
There's an overlap which
isolates this building.

34:43.600 --> 34:45.978
What is the address of this building?

34:46.018 --> 34:49.481
1205 Landon Street.

34:49.606 --> 34:50.190
Familiar?

34:50.232 --> 34:50.732
It should be.

34:50.774 --> 34:53.402
It's where Nicholas Pike lives.

35:06.999 --> 35:12.296
Mr. Pike, it's Horatio
Caine of the Crime Lab.

35:20.304 --> 35:22.180
H, we're clear.

35:23.307 --> 35:25.183
Okay, Eric.

35:29.396 --> 35:30.897
Eric.

35:32.983 --> 35:34.693
Come here a minute.

35:41.074 --> 35:43.994
This is how he selected
his victims, Eric.

35:44.036 --> 35:46.705
It looks like it's pre-progammed.

35:48.874 --> 35:51.293
He can see into Diana Long's apartment.

35:51.335 --> 35:53.378
Victim number one.

35:56.214 --> 35:58.592
It's the poolside cabana where
Ronnie Temple was murdered.

35:58.675 --> 36:00.886
Victim number two.

36:01.678 --> 36:04.973
He programmed in the order of his kills.

36:07.601 --> 36:09.102
It's Mario's apartment.

36:09.186 --> 36:13.398
Victim number three and
here goes victim number four.

36:19.404 --> 36:21.907
It's just some kid playing video games.

36:21.990 --> 36:26.411
H, those are the dorms
over at Brigton College.

36:26.578 --> 36:28.288
He's victim number four, Eric.

36:28.413 --> 36:30.374
The sun is going down.

36:55.774 --> 36:57.484
Mr. Pike?

37:00.404 --> 37:03.115
Mr. Pike, turn around slowly.

37:07.077 --> 37:09.413
Put your hands in the air.

37:11.081 --> 37:14.584
Mr. Pike, I'm not going
to ask you a second time.

37:14.710 --> 37:19.506
Turn around slowly, get down on
the ground, hands behind your head.

37:53.081 --> 37:56.877
People seem to think there's
an immediate reaction.

37:57.002 --> 37:58.795
It's like a sunburn.

37:59.087 --> 38:01.006
Takes a while before it shows up.

38:01.048 --> 38:03.383
We have plenty of time.

38:05.302 --> 38:09.306
So I have a sun allergy,
and I was at some kid's dorm.

38:09.389 --> 38:11.391
So what?

38:12.893 --> 38:16.313
I think that it's quite
a bit more than that.

38:16.355 --> 38:18.190
Did you find a murder weapon on me?

38:18.273 --> 38:19.483
As a matter of fact, we have.

38:19.608 --> 38:23.487
It's your wristwatch.

38:25.697 --> 38:27.991
Take it off, please.

38:53.100 --> 38:54.184
Let me guess.

38:54.309 --> 38:57.896
It's, uh, victims' blood.

39:17.082 --> 39:19.584
I was normal once.

39:19.626 --> 39:21.211
Active.

39:21.503 --> 39:24.089
I spent every moment I could outdoors.

39:24.214 --> 39:26.883
My body turned against me.

39:27.592 --> 39:30.387
The sun became poisonous.

39:32.806 --> 39:35.976
I was going bloody
mad stuck in my house.

39:52.409 --> 39:55.495
Used the telescope to
go to places I couldn't.

39:55.579 --> 39:57.789
I was lonely.

39:59.374 --> 40:02.002
Then I got obsessive.

40:08.383 --> 40:14.181
Diana and Mario talked
all day on their computer.

40:14.514 --> 40:17.184
They lived three minutes apart.

40:19.394 --> 40:24.274
And that loser, spending his
days selling drugs by the pool.

40:27.194 --> 40:29.196
This life...

40:29.905 --> 40:32.783
we only get one go-round.

40:34.409 --> 40:36.411
They all wasted it.

40:48.882 --> 40:50.676
Oh, my God.

41:02.688 --> 41:05.190
They were never really alive.

41:05.273 --> 41:07.067
I was doing them a favor.

41:07.109 --> 41:11.113
But that's not for you to
decide, is it, Mr. Pike?

42:27.397 --> 42:30.108
Good to have you back, Mr. Wolfe.

42:31.610 --> 42:33.779
It's good to be back.

42:36.406 --> 42:38.575
You went to bat for me.

42:40.285 --> 42:42.746
I'm never going to forget that.

42:42.788 --> 42:45.207
It's in your blood, isn't it?

42:45.707 --> 42:48.210
Never forget that.

42:54.675 --> 42:56.385
I won't.

42:58.011 --> 43:01.056
Mr. Wolfe, at the end of the day,

43:01.098 --> 43:06.478
if we don't hang
together, we'll die alone.
