I brought Jeremy back to life.

13:34.083 --> 13:35.430
That's it!

13:35.885 --> 13:37.909
I can't contact the dead.

13:38.393 --> 13:40.143
Jeremy can.

13:40.353 --> 13:41.724
I'm listening.

13:41.888 --> 13:43.939
What if I told you there
was a way to kill Klaus?

13:44.332 --> 13:46.379
And not Dagger dead.
Dead dead.

13:46.418 --> 13:48.110
I'd say you were
desperate and lying.

13:48.177 --> 13:49.427
Or drunk.

13:49.720 --> 13:51.596
Or desperate,
lying and drunk.

13:51.647 --> 13:54.116
- Do you remember my friend Pearl?
- Vividly.

13:54.200 --> 13:57.536
Centuries ago, she told me about a
vampire who knew how to kill Klaus.

13:57.556 --> 13:58.917
Then she wouldn't
tell me any more.

13:58.936 --> 14:01.106
- Well, why not?
- Because it was her leverage.

14:01.157 --> 14:03.291
She knew it was
valuable information,

14:03.376 --> 14:05.720
and wouldn't share it with me.

14:05.782 --> 14:07.045
Well, this is all great...

14:07.770 --> 14:08.964
But she's dead.

14:09.048 --> 14:10.685
Which is why I never
brought it up.

14:11.091 --> 14:12.951
Because she only ever told
one other person.

14:13.002 --> 14:14.219
- Who?
- Her daughter.

14:14.286 --> 14:15.700
- Anna.
- Also dead.

14:15.755 --> 14:17.682
Which brings us
right back around to...

14:17.724 --> 14:19.124
Jeremy: To me.

Stefan...

14:35.418 --> 14:36.408
Klaus.

14:36.475 --> 14:38.415
Come to save
your damsel, mate?

14:39.495 --> 14:41.923
I came to ask
for your forgiveness.

14:42.865 --> 14:44.416
And pledge my loyalty.

14:45.416 --> 14:47.881
Well, you broke that pledge
once already.

14:47.923 --> 14:50.041
Elena means nothing
to me anymore.

14:52.939 --> 14:55.210
And whatever
you ask of me...

14:56.190 --> 14:58.100
I will do.

14:59.515 --> 15:00.960
Fair enough.

15:01.960 --> 15:03.627
Let's drink on it.

15:04.708 --> 15:06.375
Kill them.

15:07.774 --> 15:10.308
What are you waiting
for? Kill them.

15:10.359 --> 15:12.561
No! Stefan, don't.

15:12.645 --> 15:15.730
He's not going to hurt me.
He already said... ahh!

15:21.020 --> 15:22.627
She means nothing to you?

15:22.822 --> 15:25.023
Your lies just keep
piling up.

15:25.074 --> 15:28.111
Let her go! I'll do whatever
you want, you have my word!

15:28.134 --> 15:30.028
Your word doesn't mean much.

15:30.079 --> 15:31.963
I lived by your word
all summer,

15:32.031 --> 15:34.589
during which time
I never had to resort to this...

15:34.643 --> 15:36.551
Stop fighting.

15:36.636 --> 15:38.503
Don't do this,
don't do this.

15:38.554 --> 15:41.039
I didn't want to.
All I wanted was your allegiance.

15:41.090 --> 15:42.874
Now I'm going to have
to take it.

15:42.925 --> 15:44.226
Don't... Don't...

15:44.310 --> 15:47.229
You will do
exactly as I say

15:47.313 --> 15:48.814
when I say it.

15:48.881 --> 15:51.549
You will not run,
you will not hide,

15:51.601 --> 15:55.570
you will simply just obey.

15:58.441 --> 16:00.128
No!

16:02.024 --> 16:03.941

16:06.628 --> 16:09.463

They're looking for
a way to stop Klaus.

I don't care. Katherine
is not a friend to you.

- What's she saying?

want to help you.

- My advice?
- Hmm?

If you want to make an omelet,
you have to break a few eggs.

know, it's nothing personal.

Mikael.
Is that his name?

He's a vampire

idiots to wake him.

Maybe it's possible.

Yeah, yeah.
Maybe it's just mind control, right?

that come out of your mouth,

is the sound of your heart

through your body.

ticks down...

to feed on you.

what's worse?

to be able to stop.

I don't believe that.
You can fight it.

to want it bad enough.

- Why, because I love you?
- Yeah!

everything that we've been through,

you are the one thing

from giving up;

what I am, Elena.

the more I want,

as near yours...

27:12.859 --> 27:14.327
[Gasping]

27:14.411 --> 27:16.445
Where am I?
What happened?

27:17.464 --> 27:20.032
- Tyler.
- Don't be shy about it.

27:21.284 --> 27:22.940
What's going on?

27:23.486 --> 27:25.821
Klaus is turning you
into a vampire.

27:26.264 --> 27:27.656
A hybrid.

27:28.683 --> 27:30.826
You're in transition.

27:30.877 --> 27:33.713
Don't leave out
the hard part, sweets.

27:33.797 --> 27:35.765
You'll only survive if
your witch is successful.

27:35.832 --> 27:37.133
If not...

27:37.585 --> 27:38.968
You're pretty much dead.

27:39.191 --> 27:40.473
You're going to be ok.

27:40.505 --> 27:43.140
Ok? It's going to be ok.

27:43.357 --> 27:45.551
I wonder how she's doing.

27:47.229 --> 27:50.062
Tick tock goes
the gym clock.

27:50.147 --> 27:51.630
As soon as you're
feeling better,

27:51.698 --> 27:53.315
I'm going to kill you.

27:53.367 --> 27:56.118
It worked. I saw
her, I saw Vicki.

27:56.186 --> 27:56.902
You did?

27:57.059 --> 27:59.186
- She said she had a message for you.
- For me?

27:59.342 --> 28:01.474
From the witch that put the
hybrid curse on Klaus.

28:01.541 --> 28:04.026
She said that Elena shouldn't
have survived Klaus' ritual.

28:04.094 --> 28:06.912
The hybrids can't transition
because Elena's still alive.

28:10.067 --> 28:12.435
- Tyler...
- He's going to die, isn't he?

28:12.502 --> 28:15.149
I wouldn't be
too sure about that.

28:15.672 --> 28:17.840
Given the choice,
doppelganger or a hybrid,

28:17.891 --> 28:19.975
I go hybrid every time.

28:21.627 --> 28:22.978
Elena, you're going
to have run.

28:23.046 --> 28:24.379
But Klaus said
that if I run...

28:24.481 --> 28:27.216
I know what he said, but if
you stay, it won't matter.

28:28.031 --> 28:30.556
Elena, please,
please, please.

28:31.752 --> 28:33.022
There's no other way.

28:33.073 --> 28:35.024
There is another way, Stefan.
It's for you to fight.

28:35.075 --> 28:37.726
[Buzzer sounds]

28:40.664 --> 28:42.615
Stefan...
I love you.

28:42.699 --> 28:44.667
Fight, Stefan.
Don't give up.

28:44.734 --> 28:46.735
I can't hold it.

28:48.622 --> 28:49.872
Aaah!

28:49.923 --> 28:53.242
Elena, run! Go!

29:14.505 --> 29:17.193
We've got to stop
meeting like this.

29:18.232 --> 29:20.286
[Groaning]

29:30.765 --> 29:34.049
Now this is fascinating.
I've never seen this before.

29:34.117 --> 29:36.952
The only thing stronger
than your craving for blood

29:37.003 --> 29:39.255
is your love
for this one girl.

29:40.259 --> 29:41.623
Why don't you turn it off?

29:41.675 --> 29:43.592
- No!
- Come on.

29:43.643 --> 29:45.460
Your humanity
is killing you.

29:45.512 --> 29:48.147
All the guilt
must be exhausting.

29:48.231 --> 29:50.132
- Turn it off.
- No!

29:50.183 --> 29:52.351
- Stefan...
- You're strong.

29:52.419 --> 29:55.685
But you're not
that strong.

29:57.714 --> 30:00.109
Turn... it...

30:00.160 --> 30:01.695
Off.

30:04.831 --> 30:06.916
No!

30:10.086 --> 30:13.005
Turn it off!

30:20.046 --> 30:21.931
What did you do?

30:28.772 --> 30:30.822
I fixed him.

30:31.691 --> 30:34.176
But I think a test
is in order, don't you?

30:35.855 --> 30:37.244
Ripper...

30:39.783 --> 30:41.617
Perhaps you'd
like a drink...

30:41.684 --> 30:43.118
[Inhales sharply]

30:44.083 --> 30:46.155
From the doppelganger's neck.

31:03.840 --> 31:05.558
Aaah!

31:08.605 --> 31:10.573
Well, the verdict's in.
The Original witch

31:10.657 --> 31:12.097
says the doppelganger
should be dead.

31:12.108 --> 31:13.659
Does that mean
we can kill her?

31:13.726 --> 31:15.834
No, I'm fairly certain
it means the opposite.

31:16.281 --> 31:17.169
What?!

31:17.230 --> 31:19.114
Call it a hunch...

31:20.708 --> 31:24.203
Elena's blood.
Drink it.

31:24.344 --> 31:25.975
No! No, no, no,
Tyler, don't!

31:26.045 --> 31:27.906
If he doesn't feed,
he'll die anyway, love.

31:28.581 --> 31:30.709
Consider this an experiment.

31:32.712 --> 31:34.163
It's ok.

31:39.700 --> 31:41.985
There we go.

31:44.460 --> 31:45.744
Good boy.

31:48.028 --> 31:49.928
[Grunting]

31:49.980 --> 31:51.730
Tyler? No!

31:51.781 --> 31:54.433
Bloody hell, shut up!

31:54.484 --> 31:56.902
[Groaning]

32:00.573 --> 32:03.608
[Screaming]

32:17.295 --> 32:18.957
Well, that's a good sign.

32:26.016 --> 32:28.701
[Groans]

32:33.890 --> 32:35.347
Where am I?

32:35.453 --> 32:36.900
In the hospital, sweetie.

32:36.940 --> 32:38.460
You suffered through
a terrible ordeal.

32:38.508 --> 32:40.225
I have to get out of here.

32:40.277 --> 32:44.030
Ah. Not an option.
You've lost a lot of blood.

32:45.892 --> 32:46.999
Wait...

32:47.067 --> 32:48.848
You're taking my blood?

32:48.889 --> 32:52.147
Of course. It's very important
for your friend Klaus.

32:53.707 --> 32:55.505
[Gasps]
Ah!

32:56.153 --> 32:57.654
Don't fight it, sweetie.

32:58.194 --> 33:01.380
He told me you need
plenty of rest.

33:06.142 --> 33:08.200
So the doppelganger
isn't the problem.

33:08.226 --> 33:10.061
Her blood is the solution.

33:10.228 --> 33:12.128
Seems so.

33:12.180 --> 33:13.814
How did you know?

33:13.898 --> 33:16.400
Well, you know how much
the Original witch hated me.

33:16.467 --> 33:17.901
Do you honestly think
I would do anything other

33:17.969 --> 33:19.403
than the opposite
of what she says.

33:19.821 --> 33:23.692
A thousand years in the grave and
she's still screwing with you.

33:24.086 --> 33:27.199
Well, it makes sense if you think
about it from her perspective.

33:27.235 --> 33:30.437
It was her failsafe in case I
ever broke the hybrid curse.

33:30.480 --> 33:31.847
The doppelganger had to die

33:31.876 --> 33:33.961
in order for me to become a
hybrid, but if she was dead...

33:34.007 --> 33:37.176
Then you couldn't use her blood
to sire yourself a new species.

33:37.856 --> 33:39.817
Leaving me alone for all time.

33:41.929 --> 33:44.100
Is that what
this is about?

33:44.574 --> 33:46.743
Your obsession
with hybrids.

33:47.665 --> 33:49.767
You just don't want
to be alone?

33:52.998 --> 33:54.226
What I want

33:54.294 --> 33:57.113
is to take my girl,
take my hybrid

33:57.626 --> 34:00.297
the hell out of this
one pony town.

34:03.589 --> 34:05.062
You know,
why don't you, uh,

34:05.071 --> 34:07.506
why don't you get
the truck? I'll get Elena.

34:21.780 --> 34:24.723
Well, look who finally decided
to show up to the party.

34:24.775 --> 34:25.978
- Where is she?
- Elena?

34:26.025 --> 34:29.562
Ah, she's making a donation
to a greater cause.

34:29.612 --> 34:31.293
I'm afraid I can't
let you interfere, mate.

34:31.313 --> 34:33.395
- You'll have to kill me.
- Oh, I would love to kill you,

34:33.418 --> 34:35.324
but I made a pledge
to your brother,

34:35.324 --> 34:36.935
and unlike him,
I keep my word.

34:36.987 --> 34:38.925
Although, you know what,
thinking about it now,

34:39.034 --> 34:41.657
he probably doesn't care
that much anymore.

34:41.741 --> 34:44.909
You don't want to know
about your friend Mikael?

34:44.960 --> 34:46.545
What do you know about Mikael?

34:46.612 --> 34:48.897
Just that he knows
you're here.

34:50.342 --> 34:51.466
You're bluffing.

34:51.489 --> 34:53.127
Katherine and I found him.

34:53.168 --> 34:55.303
Consider it our leverage.

34:56.623 --> 34:58.457
[Groaning]

35:14.991 --> 35:17.660
[Music playing]

35:47.995 --> 35:49.859
Damon...

35:51.695 --> 35:52.973
Hey.

35:53.680 --> 35:56.181
[Music playing]

36:13.200 --> 36:14.833
Are you sure you're ok?

36:14.885 --> 36:16.835
I'm great, Caroline.

36:16.887 --> 36:19.305
I mean, like, phenomenal.

36:19.372 --> 36:21.473
It's a rush. I wish
I could explain it.

36:22.261 --> 36:24.426
Everything's just...

36:24.978 --> 36:26.729
Better.

36:26.813 --> 36:29.064
[Laughs]
Oh!

36:43.997 --> 36:46.498
This is going to be
an amazing year.

36:46.566 --> 36:49.234
[Chuckles]

36:55.544 --> 36:56.908
Hey.

36:56.960 --> 36:59.762
You ready? I could still use
a ride over to Jeremy's.

36:59.791 --> 37:01.325
Yeah, just a second.

37:06.560 --> 37:08.520
Listen to me.

37:09.513 --> 37:12.975
I know you want to help, and
I know you miss your sister.

37:13.059 --> 37:15.227
But what you did was
reckless and stupid.

37:15.278 --> 37:17.563
I know. Bonnie.

37:18.544 --> 37:19.798
I know.

37:21.384 --> 37:23.902
But it worked.
It was worth it.

37:23.954 --> 37:26.104
You don't want to be a
part of all this, Matt.

37:26.156 --> 37:27.740
You are the only
one of us who actually

37:27.791 --> 37:30.576
gets to live your life
like a normal person,

37:30.627 --> 37:32.661
no matter
how lost you feel.

37:33.177 --> 37:35.306
Don't forget that.

37:36.716 --> 37:38.950
I get it, Bonnie.

37:40.900 --> 37:43.339
I'll be out in a minute, ok?

37:45.463 --> 37:46.958
Vicki's here.

37:48.449 --> 37:51.347
Watching me, and I just, uh,

37:52.151 --> 37:54.433
I just need a minute
to say good-bye, ok?

38:08.296 --> 38:10.533
Bon, seriously,

38:10.658 --> 38:13.687
I'm not going to do
anything stupid, I just...

38:15.404 --> 38:16.955
Vickie?

38:23.396 --> 38:25.497
Hi, Mattie.

38:36.096 --> 38:37.893
Damon: Hey,
have some bourbon.

38:41.147 --> 38:42.748
It'll help you forget.

38:46.319 --> 38:47.853
[Sips] Mmm.

38:47.904 --> 38:50.021
Yeah, it's strong.

38:52.325 --> 38:54.993
You know I can help you
forget, too.

38:57.637 --> 38:59.794
At least the memories
you don't want to keep.

38:59.811 --> 39:02.909
No. No compulsion.

39:04.337 --> 39:06.050
I need to remember.

39:07.357 --> 39:08.995
All of it.

39:18.768 --> 39:20.569
I stole it back for you.

39:25.635 --> 39:27.776
He's really gone
this time.

39:28.759 --> 39:30.642
I watched it happen.

39:31.197 --> 39:34.750
After everything that we went
through to get... to help him.

39:35.735 --> 39:37.586
Now he's just...

39:38.295 --> 39:40.163
Gone.

39:54.089 --> 39:56.555
Where were you, Damon?

39:58.830 --> 40:00.783
I shouldn't have left.

40:08.034 --> 40:10.285
I promise you...

40:11.139 --> 40:14.679
I will never leave you again.

40:21.523 --> 40:23.960
Stefan: Well,
isn't this cozy?

40:26.336 --> 40:28.700
What are you doing
here, brother?

40:30.511 --> 40:32.391
Last I checked,

40:33.085 --> 40:34.804
I live here.

40:37.179 --> 40:39.898
Klaus is gone,
but he's asked me

40:39.966 --> 40:42.692
to keep watch on you
until he returns.

40:43.849 --> 40:47.289
From now on,
you're under my protection.

40:52.529 --> 40:53.829
Mmm, by all means.

40:54.237 --> 40:55.816
Carry on.

41:03.289 --> 41:05.345
Katherine: How do you know
that Anna wasn't tricking you?

41:05.439 --> 41:06.491
Jeremy:
This is the place.

41:06.543 --> 41:08.827
It's the oldest wing of the
largest cemetery in Charlotte.

41:08.878 --> 41:11.565
She said that a witch entombed
them here in the nineties.

41:12.999 --> 41:14.633
Look there.
