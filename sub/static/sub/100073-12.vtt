WEBVTT

00:01.460 --> 00:04.420
Control, 7-Adam-15.
Show us on a vehicle stop,

00:04.420 --> 00:05.460
Sherman Grove and Wyngate.
Clear for plate.

00:05.460 --> 00:08.420
 Go ahead.
2 Frank Adam Nora 3-2-1 

00:08.420 --> 00:10.250
Let's book it!
 They're bailing.

00:10.250 --> 00:12.120
Control, we got
multiple runners 

00:12.120 --> 00:14.750
East and Westbound. Need
Code 3 units and an airship.

00:19.000 --> 00:21.040
Move!
Get out of here!

00:21.040 --> 00:23.670
Driver's heading East.
Nolan, with me.

00:25.000 --> 00:31.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:02.380 --> 01:04.540
So, um...
How is she?

01:04.540 --> 01:07.620
She made me run out to buy
her concealer at 6:00 a.m.

01:07.620 --> 01:09.620
To cover the tattoo.
She does it every morning.

01:09.620 --> 01:11.540
Well, wouldn't you?
I mean, can you imagine

01:11.540 --> 01:13.960
walking around with
a serial killer's brand on you?

01:13.960 --> 01:16.250
When can she have it
removed?

01:16.250 --> 01:19.040
Four weeks, two days,
nine hours.

01:19.040 --> 01:20.790
Hey, for your
first day back,

01:20.790 --> 01:22.580
I thought you could use
some sugar and some carbs.

01:22.580 --> 01:24.040
Oh, that's sweet.

01:24.040 --> 01:25.830
Literally.

01:25.830 --> 01:27.790
So, are you ready?

01:27.790 --> 01:29.080
Absolutely.

01:29.080 --> 01:30.880
Um, doctor signed off
on physical,

01:30.880 --> 01:32.500
department shrink
signed off on mental.

01:32.500 --> 01:34.620
Oh, uh, but could
you do me a favor?
Anything.

01:34.620 --> 01:37.290
I just don't want everybody
clapping during roll call, so 

01:37.290 --> 01:39.580
Well, that's tradition,
though.

01:39.580 --> 01:42.080
You know, I mean, you survive
something like that,

01:42.080 --> 01:44.960
they're gonna want to
show you some respect.

01:44.960 --> 01:46.500
I'll see what I can do.
Thank you.

01:46.500 --> 01:48.210
Hey, did Henry and Abigail
make it in last night?

01:48.210 --> 01:50.250
Yes. Boy, they have
a whole long list

01:50.250 --> 01:52.420
of wedding venues
they need to investigate.

01:52.420 --> 01:54.040
Oh, fun.

01:54.040 --> 01:55.330
No?
No, yes.

01:55.330 --> 01:57.460
No, yeah 
I mean, yes.

01:57.460 --> 02:00.250
It's just  It's a lot
to take in, you know?

02:00.250 --> 02:01.880
It seems like
only yesterday

02:01.880 --> 02:05.040
Henry was a toddler
on my shoulders,

02:05.040 --> 02:06.960
just holding on to my hair,

02:06.960 --> 02:08.710
his little feet
in my hands.

02:08.710 --> 02:09.960
Aww, that's sweet.

02:09.960 --> 02:11.380
He was a bit of a puker.

02:12.790 --> 02:14.460
So hard to get that
smell out of your hair.

02:14.460 --> 02:15.750
Ew.

02:18.000 --> 02:19.620
Hey, so,
what's your plan?

02:19.620 --> 02:21.460
For what?
Officer Chen.

02:21.460 --> 02:23.790
I'm sure you've got
some Alpha strategy

02:23.790 --> 02:24.830
to get her
"back on the horse."

02:24.830 --> 02:26.080
So, what is it?

02:26.080 --> 02:27.250
Your standard
input overload.

02:27.250 --> 02:29.170
Force her to push through
dynamic engagements.

02:29.170 --> 02:30.620
Hone in her
fight-or-flight response.

02:30.620 --> 02:33.500
So basically get her into
as many fights as possible.

02:33.500 --> 02:35.380
I'm gonna remind her that
she's a cop, not a victim.

02:35.380 --> 02:37.290
She knows she's not a victim.

02:37.290 --> 02:39.290
Look, Chen doesn't
need to fight,

02:39.290 --> 02:42.380
she needs to make peace with
the voice inside of her head

02:42.380 --> 02:44.500
telling her she's never
gonna be safe again.

02:44.500 --> 02:46.250
Okay, I've been training rookies
a lot longer than you.

02:46.250 --> 02:48.330
I know what she needs.
That's ego talking.

02:53.120 --> 02:56.670
What happened to Chen
is every woman's worst fear.

02:56.670 --> 03:00.000
I'm aware of that.
But you have never
lived that fear.

03:00.000 --> 03:02.790
It's clear that you have
her best interests at heart.

03:02.790 --> 03:04.460
I'm just asking you
to consider

03:04.460 --> 03:07.420
whether she might
be better served by...

03:07.420 --> 03:10.580
someone who has been through
what she has been through.

03:12.750 --> 03:14.290
And that someone's you.

03:21.420 --> 03:23.210
Okay.

03:23.210 --> 03:24.710
I'll tell Grey
to make the switch.

03:27.620 --> 03:29.670
Hey!

03:29.670 --> 03:31.040
What are you guys
doing here?

03:31.040 --> 03:33.210
Oh, the wedding venue
we were gonna look at

03:33.210 --> 03:35.040
got shut down by
the health department.

03:35.040 --> 03:37.420
Oh! I guess you're crossing
that one off your list.

03:37.420 --> 03:39.580
Are you kidding?
It'll be super cheap now 

03:39.580 --> 03:41.540
which is our price point.

03:41.540 --> 03:43.750
Well, I am just
starting my shift,

03:43.750 --> 03:45.790
so I-I really can't
hang out with you.

03:45.790 --> 03:49.170
Actually, I was hoping
I could hang out with you.

03:49.170 --> 03:51.210
I've done a lot of
self-reflection

03:51.210 --> 03:52.620
since I dropped out
of school,

03:52.620 --> 03:55.540
and meeting you, seeing how
you reinvented your life,

03:55.540 --> 03:56.920
has been really inspiring.

03:56.920 --> 03:59.670
Wow, Abigail. Thank you.
That's a very nice thing to say.

03:59.670 --> 04:02.210
It's made me want to
become a cop.

04:02.210 --> 04:04.670
So I was hoping I could
do a ride-along today.

04:06.920 --> 04:09.920
Ha!
You almost had me.

04:09.920 --> 04:11.250
This is another,
"I'm pregnant 

04:11.250 --> 04:12.790
psych,
I'm not pregnant" bit.

04:12.790 --> 04:14.120
Yeah, I'm not
falling for it.

04:14.120 --> 04:16.380
No, no, she's 
she's serious, Dad.

04:16.380 --> 04:17.380
Totally.

04:17.380 --> 04:19.209
I'm  Oh, okay, sorry.
Uh...

04:19.209 --> 04:21.959
Oh. Well,
given your history, Abigail,

04:21.959 --> 04:24.120
with the arson, I don't know
that that's possible.

04:24.120 --> 04:26.000
She was 17
when that happened.

04:26.000 --> 04:28.080
And  And I was
never convicted.

04:28.080 --> 04:29.750
Right.
The DA cut me a deal.

04:29.750 --> 04:33.080
I realize it won't be easy,
but I really want to try.

04:33.080 --> 04:34.880
Well, I'd have to ask
the watch commander.

04:36.170 --> 04:37.670
But, you know,
he's always saying

04:37.670 --> 04:39.250
recruit the brightest
and the best, so...

04:39.250 --> 04:41.460
Great. I'll just grab
my jacket from the car.
Okay.

04:44.000 --> 04:45.830
You can't let her
become a cop.

04:45.830 --> 04:47.420
What?

04:47.420 --> 04:49.170
Yeah, she's been talking
about this for weeks.

04:49.170 --> 04:50.830
And I'm trying to
be encouraging,

04:50.830 --> 04:53.380
but I'm barely okay

04:53.380 --> 04:54.880
worrying if you're gonna
make it home every night.

04:54.880 --> 04:56.500
I-I can't do that with her.

04:56.500 --> 04:58.920
Well, this sounds like something
you should discuss with her.

04:58.920 --> 05:02.750
Dad, please, can you just make
sure she has a-a bad time?

05:02.750 --> 05:03.880
Henry, I can't do that.

05:03.880 --> 05:05.460
Please.
I-I...

05:05.460 --> 05:08.500
I can lean into
the bad parts.
Great.

05:08.500 --> 05:10.170
Okay. Uh 
T-Thank you.
That's wonderful.

05:10.170 --> 05:12.460
Reporting for duty, sir!

05:12.460 --> 05:14.540
This is gonna be great.

05:33.960 --> 05:35.210
Sorry, I tried.

05:35.210 --> 05:37.210
Yeah, you're dead to me.

05:37.210 --> 05:39.290
Welcome back, Officer Chen.
How're you feeling?

05:39.290 --> 05:40.540
Can't wait to get on
the streets, sir.

05:40.540 --> 05:41.790
Just get back to normal.

05:41.790 --> 05:42.920
So glad to hear that.

05:42.920 --> 05:44.330
We're gonna
mix things up a bit.

05:44.330 --> 05:46.420
You're gonna be riding
with Harper this week.

05:46.420 --> 05:49.500
Which means, Nolan, you and your
ride-along are with Bradford.

05:49.500 --> 05:50.880
Sorry, wait. What?
Ride-along?

05:50.880 --> 05:53.710
Which brings us
to Officer West.

05:53.710 --> 05:56.290
Tell me, son, you enjoy
the red carpet last night?

05:56.290 --> 05:58.080
What? H-How did you know
I was at a red carpet 

05:58.080 --> 06:00.250
LAPD Media Relations
sent me a link.

06:00.250 --> 06:01.620
And now some hot goss

06:01.620 --> 06:04.170
from "Hot Suspect" star
Sterling Freeman.

06:04.170 --> 06:06.120
TV's favorite cop has
been hitting the town

06:06.120 --> 06:09.170
with real-life LAPD Officer
Jackson West.

06:09.170 --> 06:11.420
Looks like these cops should
call the fire department,

06:11.420 --> 06:13.920
'cause it's getting
hot in here.

06:13.920 --> 06:15.920
Okay.

06:15.920 --> 06:17.540
Yeah, no, no, no,
keep laughing.

06:17.540 --> 06:19.380
I also gained 10,000
new Instagram followers

06:19.380 --> 06:20.500
overnight, so 

06:20.500 --> 06:22.670
West, the only followers
you should worry about

06:22.670 --> 06:24.170
are your superiors.

06:24.170 --> 06:26.000
Think about us next time
you're out on the town.

06:26.000 --> 06:28.580
Yes, sir.
Alright. That's it.

06:28.580 --> 06:30.670
Stay safe out there.

06:30.670 --> 06:32.330
Nolan, you scheduled
a ride-along

06:32.330 --> 06:33.920
without clearing it
with your TO first?

06:33.920 --> 06:35.330
No, sir. I cleared it
with Detective Harper.

06:35.330 --> 06:37.170
She said it was alright.

06:37.170 --> 06:40.000
'Cause she knew she wasn't
riding with you today.

06:40.000 --> 06:41.580
Alright, so who
am I saddled up with?

06:41.580 --> 06:43.790
Uh, it's my future
daughter-in-law,

06:43.790 --> 06:44.960
Abigail, over there.

06:44.960 --> 06:46.710
She's considering signing up
to the Academy.

06:46.710 --> 06:48.580
She's like nine pounds.

06:48.580 --> 06:49.960
And I'm not interested in
chasing tame calls today.

06:49.960 --> 06:51.040
Uh, no need to.

06:51.040 --> 06:52.250
I think Abigail
would benefit

06:52.250 --> 06:55.250
from seeing the harsh side
of police work.

06:55.250 --> 06:56.620
You don't want her
to be a cop.

06:56.620 --> 06:59.920
I'm merely concerned
about her suitability.

06:59.920 --> 07:02.960
So perhaps we should show her
what she'd be signing up for?

07:02.960 --> 07:04.460
No problem.

07:04.460 --> 07:06.250
Scaring rookies off the job
is my specialty.

07:10.880 --> 07:12.250
Hi, I'm Abigail.

07:12.250 --> 07:13.960
My name
is Officer Bradford.

07:13.960 --> 07:15.580
You'll address me only
as Officer Bradford.

07:15.580 --> 07:16.620
Do you understand?

07:16.620 --> 07:17.880
You sign
the liability waiver?

07:17.880 --> 07:19.120
Yes, sir.

07:19.120 --> 07:20.670
Officer Bradford.
Good.

07:20.670 --> 07:22.000
Then you understand
you could be injured,

07:22.000 --> 07:23.790
maimed, paralyzed,
burned, or killed

07:23.790 --> 07:26.500
during this ride-along.
I mean, yeah, sure.

07:26.500 --> 07:28.170
We're not tour guides 
we're the police.

07:28.170 --> 07:29.960
We drive towards
the sound of gunshots.

07:29.960 --> 07:30.790
So, if that's
gonna be a problem,

07:30.790 --> 07:32.670
you should bail out now.

07:33.620 --> 07:35.120
No problem at all.

07:35.120 --> 07:36.460
Let's go find
some gunshots.

07:40.750 --> 07:42.830
So, why the switch?

07:42.830 --> 07:44.710
Tim felt you'd be better served
riding with me.

07:44.710 --> 07:46.420
Yeah, right.

07:46.420 --> 07:48.580
This has to be some kind of
elaborate Tim Test

07:48.580 --> 07:50.540
that he roped you into.
Do I strike you as someone

07:50.540 --> 07:51.960
who could get roped
into anything?

07:51.960 --> 07:53.880
Especially by Bradford.

07:53.880 --> 07:55.250
Fair enough.

07:55.250 --> 07:58.000
So, I'll ask you again 
why the switch?

08:01.920 --> 08:04.330
I convinced him
that I would have more insight

08:04.330 --> 08:05.880
into what
you were going through.

08:05.880 --> 08:07.420
And could therefore
be more helpful

08:07.420 --> 08:09.580
to your re-integration
onto the street.

08:09.580 --> 08:11.460
Did you go on a date
with a serial killer, too?

08:14.080 --> 08:17.420
Uh, no.
Well, then I'm not sure
how much help you'd be.

08:17.420 --> 08:19.670
But it's fine, 'cause
I don't need any help.

08:19.670 --> 08:21.040
I've already worked
through the trauma

08:21.040 --> 08:23.000
using both cognitive
and exposure therapy,

08:23.000 --> 08:24.500
combined with
mindful breathing

08:24.500 --> 08:27.540
and Eye Movement Desensitization
and Reprocessing,

08:27.540 --> 08:29.830
so it's  it's fine.

08:31.380 --> 08:32.539
You don't get it 

08:32.539 --> 08:34.380
Grey didn't show
that red-carpet stuff

08:34.380 --> 08:36.539
just to tell you how to act
appropriately off-duty.

08:36.539 --> 08:39.750
He's sending you a message 
fame and police work don't mix.

08:39.750 --> 08:41.580
Come on. Look,
it was just my fifteen minutes.

08:41.580 --> 08:43.419
That's not a thing
you should want.

08:43.419 --> 08:45.500
Unless you want to say goodbye
to doing undercover.

08:45.500 --> 08:46.670
Or joining SWAT.

08:46.670 --> 08:48.000
Or Robbery/Homicide.

08:48.000 --> 08:49.540
Nobody's gonna wanna
ride with a "celebrity."

08:49.540 --> 08:51.500
Okay, look, you're blowing
this way out of proportion.

08:51.500 --> 08:53.080
Okay?
It was just a red carpet.

08:53.080 --> 08:54.670
I have it under control.

08:57.120 --> 08:58.500
Does that guy
look familiar?

08:58.500 --> 09:00.620
You mean Captain Suspicious?
Yeah.

09:00.620 --> 09:02.580
I think I saw him on a BOLO
back at the station.

09:02.580 --> 09:04.250
Run his plate.

09:04.250 --> 09:06.880
I'm guessing we're looking
at our first arrest of the day.

09:08.120 --> 09:09.580
 If you really want
to be a cop,

09:09.580 --> 09:11.290
first thing you need to
come to terms with is death 

09:11.290 --> 09:12.790
in all its forms.

09:12.790 --> 09:14.380
Stay here.

09:14.380 --> 09:15.670
I'll never get used
to the smell of death.

09:15.670 --> 09:16.790
 It's actually
not that bad.

09:16.790 --> 09:18.960
But I kind of got a thing
for armpits.

09:18.960 --> 09:21.120
The funkier the better.
I don't need to know that.

09:23.290 --> 09:25.420
We got a jumper.
Did a header from the roof.

09:25.420 --> 09:26.960
You really don't
want to see this.

09:26.960 --> 09:28.920
No, I kinda do.

09:28.920 --> 09:30.830
If you're gonna hurl, kid,
do it over there.

09:32.920 --> 09:34.790
Huh.

09:34.790 --> 09:36.670
I'm not even sure
what I'm looking at.

09:36.670 --> 09:39.500
Impact velocity tends to
turn people into piÃ±atas.

09:39.500 --> 09:42.120
Five stories onto asphalt,
and it's limbs akimbo.

09:42.120 --> 09:44.380
That's his left leg.
That's his spine.

09:44.380 --> 09:46.540
Oh, okay.
Yeah, I see now.

09:46.540 --> 09:48.210
We got an I.D.?
Yeah.

09:48.210 --> 09:49.750
Heston Dayton, 22.

09:49.750 --> 09:51.380
You thinking homicide?
Suicide?

09:51.380 --> 09:53.210
I won't know
until I do an autopsy.

09:53.210 --> 09:54.380
And even then,
it might not be clear

09:54.380 --> 09:55.580
given the state of the body.

09:55.580 --> 09:56.920
Have you notified
next of kin?

09:56.920 --> 09:58.120
Not yet.

10:01.250 --> 10:03.000
Okay, let detectives know
that we'll take care of it.

10:03.000 --> 10:04.920
C'mon.

10:04.920 --> 10:06.250
Thank you.

10:06.250 --> 10:08.380
That was cool.

10:08.380 --> 10:09.960
That was a human being.

10:09.960 --> 10:11.080
We're about to go
tell his family

10:11.080 --> 10:12.460
they'll never
see him again.

10:12.460 --> 10:14.040
 7-Adam-07, be advised,

10:14.040 --> 10:15.670
vehicle is registered

10:15.670 --> 10:17.500
to a felon
with outstanding warrants.

10:17.500 --> 10:18.620
I love being right.

10:18.620 --> 10:20.790
First name Jedi,
last name Monet,

10:20.790 --> 10:22.330
sending details to your box.

10:22.330 --> 10:23.620
Whoa.

10:23.620 --> 10:26.580
Seems Mr. Monet has
an affinity for armed robbery

10:26.580 --> 10:28.290
and assault
with a deadly weapon.

10:28.290 --> 10:30.290
Light him up?
No, get backup going first.

10:30.290 --> 10:32.170
Better safe than sorry
with this clown.

10:32.170 --> 10:35.420
7-Adam-07, headed south
on Hauser near 9th.

10:35.420 --> 10:37.080
Need backup for
a felony car stop.

10:37.080 --> 10:38.830
You sure?
Hell, yeah.

10:38.830 --> 10:40.380
7-Adam-19, responding.

10:40.380 --> 10:42.750
We're approximately 30 seconds
out, heading Northbound.

10:46.790 --> 10:48.290
Five bucks he rabbits.

10:52.830 --> 10:54.250
You can pay me after.

10:54.250 --> 10:56.120
You never accepted
the bet, so...

11:04.170 --> 11:05.460
Driver,
turn off the vehicle

11:05.460 --> 11:07.420
and place both hands
outside the window.

11:10.580 --> 11:13.420
Oh, my God,
you're that cop!
Aah!

11:13.420 --> 11:15.210
Sterling's boyfriend!
Oh, my God!

11:15.210 --> 11:16.670
Are you shooting a scene?
Jackson, get them
the hell out of here!

11:16.670 --> 11:18.500
Hey, ladies,
you need to step back!
Aah!

11:18.500 --> 11:19.620
He's gonna arrest me!
Ladies. Ladies, ladies.

11:19.620 --> 11:20.830
you need to get back.
 Jackson!

11:22.250 --> 11:23.880
Ladies, stay back.
He's running.
He's running!

11:23.880 --> 11:25.790
-Lady, stay back.

11:29.580 --> 11:31.710
 Get out of the store,
get out of the store.

11:31.710 --> 11:33.330
Back!

11:33.330 --> 11:35.040
Move! Move, move!

11:43.790 --> 11:45.420
 He's empty!

11:45.420 --> 11:48.540
Hey!
Stop where you are!

11:48.540 --> 11:49.830
Police!
Stop right there!

11:49.830 --> 11:51.170
Hands behind your head,
fingers laced.

11:51.170 --> 11:52.250
Down on your knees.

11:52.250 --> 11:53.580
Control, show us
one in custody.

11:53.580 --> 11:54.580
Code 4.

11:55.790 --> 11:57.120
Nice of you to join us.

11:57.120 --> 11:58.620
Maybe our suspect
wants your autograph.

12:29.250 --> 12:31.580
Hey, I-I just wanted to say
I'm sorry about before 

12:31.580 --> 12:33.080
at the crime scene.

12:33.080 --> 12:35.250
I wasn't thinking
about the family.

12:35.250 --> 12:38.670
I get it, but listen 
what we're here to do is awful.

12:38.670 --> 12:40.120
Death notifications
always are.

12:40.120 --> 12:42.290
You spend the drive over
dreading it.

12:42.290 --> 12:43.710
Trying to come up with words

12:43.710 --> 12:46.420
that will somehow
soften the blow.

12:46.420 --> 12:48.250
Knowing that
there aren't any.

12:48.250 --> 12:50.750
This boy lived here
with his mother and his sister,

12:50.750 --> 12:52.000
and what we're
about to tell them

12:52.000 --> 12:53.670
has the potential
to destroy lives.

12:53.670 --> 12:54.960
There's no shame in
waiting in the shop

12:54.960 --> 12:56.460
if you're not up for it.

13:00.790 --> 13:01.830
Police!

13:03.790 --> 13:06.080
What?
What'd he do this time?

13:06.080 --> 13:08.460
Ma'am, I'm Officer Bradford.
This is Officer Nolan.

13:08.460 --> 13:09.710
Can we come in?
No.

13:09.710 --> 13:11.000
Ma'am, I think it's
best if you let 

13:11.000 --> 13:13.830
Just tell me
what Heston did.

13:13.830 --> 13:15.000
We regret to inform you

13:15.000 --> 13:17.210
that your son was killed
this morning.

13:19.080 --> 13:21.880
-What?
-What's going on?

13:21.880 --> 13:23.330
Mom?

13:26.750 --> 13:28.040
Your brother's dead.

13:30.830 --> 13:32.830
No.
I'm afraid so.

13:32.830 --> 13:35.120
What happened?

13:35.120 --> 13:36.920
He fell from a building
in downtown.

13:36.920 --> 13:38.420
It's possible he jumped.

13:38.420 --> 13:40.540
No, he would never
do that.

13:40.540 --> 13:42.080
N-N-Never.

13:44.170 --> 13:45.210
Do you know what
he was doing downtown?

13:45.210 --> 13:46.250
No.

13:47.620 --> 13:49.670
I hadn't seen him
in a couple of days.

13:52.620 --> 13:54.710
I'm  I'm so sorry.

13:56.120 --> 13:57.500
Who are you?

13:57.500 --> 13:59.210
I'm Abigail.
I'm  I'm doing a ride-along.

14:01.000 --> 14:02.000
It doesn't matter.

14:02.000 --> 14:03.540
Did you see him 

14:03.540 --> 14:05.000
his body?

14:06.080 --> 14:06.920
No.

14:09.040 --> 14:10.380
Is there anything
I can do?

14:10.380 --> 14:11.790
Like what?
Make him alive again?

14:11.790 --> 14:14.330
Can you do that?

14:14.330 --> 14:15.580
No.

14:15.580 --> 14:17.380
You asked what Heston
had "done now"?

14:17.380 --> 14:18.880
What kind of trouble
was your son into?

14:18.880 --> 14:21.040
Just hanging around
with idiots.

14:21.040 --> 14:22.290
Anybody
we should talk to?

14:27.880 --> 14:30.420
What did you do?!
Guys!

14:30.420 --> 14:32.040
What the hell did you do?!
What?

14:32.040 --> 14:33.250
It's your fault he's dead!

14:33.250 --> 14:34.290
What the hell
are you squawking about?

14:34.290 --> 14:35.380
Hey, leave her alone!

14:35.380 --> 14:37.170
Hey.

14:37.170 --> 14:38.620
Here. Ma'am 
Ma'am, calm down.

14:38.620 --> 14:41.080
Who is this guy?
He's the reason
Heston's dead!

14:41.080 --> 14:42.620
What are you talking about?

14:42.620 --> 14:43.620
I just talked to him
this morning.
Get up.

14:45.080 --> 14:47.170
7-Adam-15, can you run
a name for me?

14:47.170 --> 14:50.500
Everest Jones,
born 02/01/96.

14:50.500 --> 14:52.710
Wait, he  he's not
really dead, is he?
Yes, he is.

14:52.710 --> 14:54.500
If you know anything about it,
you need to tell us right now.

14:54.500 --> 14:55.540
Dude, I don't
know anything.

14:55.540 --> 14:56.620
Liar!
Hey, hey.

14:56.620 --> 14:58.880
Do you have a specific
accusation?

14:58.880 --> 15:01.380
No. But ever since Heston's been
hanging out with this loser,

15:01.380 --> 15:02.920
he's been getting
himself in trouble.

15:02.920 --> 15:05.750
 7-Adam-15, first name
Everest, last name Jones.

15:05.750 --> 15:08.170
Priors for criminal threats
and brandishing a firearm.

15:08.170 --> 15:09.750
You're under arrest for
assault and battery.

15:09.750 --> 15:11.000
They attacked me.

15:11.000 --> 15:12.040
Detectives
will come by later

15:12.040 --> 15:13.620
to talk to you and your mom.

15:13.620 --> 15:16.540
If you have any questions,
give me a call.

15:21.580 --> 15:25.170
Thanks for jumping
in the fight.

15:25.170 --> 15:26.380
No problem.

15:26.380 --> 15:29.000
And sorry for biting
your head off.

15:29.000 --> 15:30.620
It's okay.
I can't even imagine

15:30.620 --> 15:32.170
what you must be feeling
right now.

15:34.120 --> 15:35.380
Take care of yourself.

15:41.880 --> 15:43.000
You okay?

15:45.790 --> 15:47.420
Better than her.

15:49.620 --> 15:51.750
Come on.

15:52.750 --> 15:53.750
Turn to the right.

15:54.830 --> 15:56.290
Okay, and that concludes
today's festivities.

15:56.290 --> 15:58.080
Transport'll be here soon.

16:02.080 --> 16:03.170
You want me to do
the paperwork?

16:03.170 --> 16:04.290
Oh, nope.

16:04.290 --> 16:05.960
That was a nice job
out there.

16:05.960 --> 16:07.580
Thanks.

16:07.580 --> 16:09.120
So, you're just not gonna
let me help you at all.

16:09.120 --> 16:10.620
I don't need any help.

16:10.620 --> 16:12.540
I already told you, I'm fine.

16:12.540 --> 16:13.750
We'll see.

16:15.250 --> 16:16.500
Abigail?

16:16.500 --> 16:18.120
Hey.
Hi.

16:18.120 --> 16:20.000
I'm so glad
you're okay.

16:20.000 --> 16:21.500
Did you get
the flowers we sent?

16:21.500 --> 16:23.460
And the basket.
Thank you.

16:23.460 --> 16:26.210
So, you're Nolan's
ride-along.

16:26.210 --> 16:29.120
How's it going?
It's, uh, a lot.

16:29.120 --> 16:30.420
Mm-hmm.
What the hell is this?

16:30.420 --> 16:31.880
I let you run around with Harper
for half a day

16:31.880 --> 16:33.750
and you start hugging
people on duty?

16:33.750 --> 16:35.540
Don't listen to him.
He's all bark.

16:35.540 --> 16:36.620
I gotta pee.

16:38.460 --> 16:40.250
All bark?

16:40.250 --> 16:42.500
She is not buying
what you're selling.

16:42.500 --> 16:45.250
That's because I don't hold
her fate in my hands.

16:45.250 --> 16:46.620
Heard you dodged
some bullets.

16:46.620 --> 16:49.250
Yeah, a few.

16:49.250 --> 16:52.120
What, are you
keeping tabs on me?

16:52.120 --> 16:54.880
Look, if you need anything,
you let me know.

16:54.880 --> 16:56.040
You got a time machine?

17:00.000 --> 17:02.040
I wish I did.

17:02.040 --> 17:04.250
Alright, Everest,
time to come clean.

17:04.250 --> 17:06.040
You need to tell us what
you know about Heston.

17:06.040 --> 17:08.000
Maybe he did really jump.
How the hell should I know?

17:08.000 --> 17:09.710
His sister tried to
scratch your eyes out.

17:09.710 --> 17:11.579
She thinks
you're responsible.
Well, I was at the DMV

17:11.579 --> 17:13.579
in Culver City all morning,
clearing up tickets, so 

17:13.579 --> 17:15.040
They got cameras there,
so if you're lying 

17:15.040 --> 17:16.790
I'm not!
And I know my rights.

17:16.790 --> 17:18.670
I don't have to talk
to you two anymore, so...

17:21.540 --> 17:22.750
Get him processed.

17:22.750 --> 17:24.119
I'll get the detectives
table up to speed.

17:24.119 --> 17:24.920
Right.

17:27.250 --> 17:29.250
You warned me,
and I didn't listen.

17:29.250 --> 17:31.120
Like it or not,
I'm a celebrity now.

17:31.120 --> 17:33.540
Celebrity-adjacent.
Hey, whatever.

17:33.540 --> 17:36.210
Look, e-either way, somebody
almost got hurt today

17:36.210 --> 17:38.210
because of me  because
I thought it'd be cool

17:38.210 --> 17:40.000
to walk down
the actual red carpet,

17:40.000 --> 17:40.920
have people
take my picture.

17:40.920 --> 17:42.380
It made me feel important.

17:42.380 --> 17:43.710
You're young. You still
think popularity matters.

17:43.710 --> 17:45.460
So, what do I do?

17:45.460 --> 17:47.080
I can't answer that.

17:47.080 --> 17:50.920
Wait, you think I should
break things off with Sterling?

17:50.920 --> 17:53.960
Unless you got another way
to stay under the radar 

17:53.960 --> 17:55.120
yeah.

18:02.880 --> 18:04.380
A little hungry?

18:04.380 --> 18:05.460
No.

18:07.500 --> 18:10.330
I get it.

18:10.330 --> 18:14.080
This job isn't how you
imagined it would be.

18:14.080 --> 18:15.330
What's gonna happen
with Everest?

18:15.330 --> 18:16.500
Well,
he's got an alibi.

18:16.500 --> 18:18.170
Detectives will run it down.

18:18.170 --> 18:19.620
If it's real,
he'll get "cited out,"

18:19.620 --> 18:21.290
be home before dark.

18:21.290 --> 18:23.500
It's still possible Heston's
death was an accident 

18:23.500 --> 18:25.210
or a suicide.

18:25.210 --> 18:27.040
An autopsy's gonna
shed some light on that.

18:27.040 --> 18:29.580
Look, it's good
that you see now

18:29.580 --> 18:32.040
how rough this job can be,
before you sign on.

18:32.040 --> 18:34.290
Now you can move on

18:34.290 --> 18:36.620
and figure out what it is
you really want to do.

18:36.620 --> 18:38.380
But I really want
to do this.

18:38.380 --> 18:39.880
Now more than ever.

18:39.880 --> 18:43.580
Your job affects people  makes
a difference in their lives.

18:43.580 --> 18:45.380
If there had been a cop
like you around

18:45.380 --> 18:48.500
back when I needed help...
things would've been different.

18:50.460 --> 18:52.290
Thanks for making
today happen.

18:52.290 --> 18:54.210
And for believing in me.

19:03.460 --> 19:05.250
Hey.
Where's your ride-along?

19:05.250 --> 19:06.500
Oh, Henry came
to pick her up.

19:06.500 --> 19:08.040
They're crashing a wedding
in Malibu

19:08.040 --> 19:09.380
to see
if they like the place.

19:09.380 --> 19:10.960
Well, let her know
I thought she showed

19:10.960 --> 19:12.920
some solid
instincts today.

19:12.920 --> 19:14.710
And she's clearly
got some fight in her.

19:14.710 --> 19:17.080
So, I'd be happy to put in
a word when she turns 21.

19:17.080 --> 19:18.670
That's very nice of you.

19:18.670 --> 19:21.290
You should know she's got
a little trouble in her past 

19:21.290 --> 19:23.040
you know, she knows
that's gonna make the road

19:23.040 --> 19:25.380
a little harder for her,
but she's committed.

19:25.380 --> 19:26.710
Okay,
what kind of trouble?

19:28.120 --> 19:30.170
Ex-boyfriend put
some revenge porn

19:30.170 --> 19:31.670
on the Internet
when she was 17.

19:31.670 --> 19:32.750
She kind of torched
his car 

19:32.750 --> 19:35.080
She'll never be a cop.

19:35.080 --> 19:36.580
She knows she handled it
the wrong way.

19:36.580 --> 19:37.710
She did a ton of
community service 
Doesn't matter.

19:37.710 --> 19:40.170
The law sees it as an incident
of domestic violence 

19:40.170 --> 19:42.330
that's a hard pass
at the Academy.

19:42.330 --> 19:43.250
There's gotta be something
she can do 

19:43.250 --> 19:44.620
There isn't.

19:44.620 --> 19:46.290
It's a shame.

19:46.290 --> 19:47.880
She seems like
a good kid.

19:51.620 --> 19:53.620
Oh!

20:03.920 --> 20:05.540
You're not gonna shower?

20:05.540 --> 20:08.170
Uh, I'm gonna do it
at home.

20:08.170 --> 20:09.330
Oh, but you're not
going home.

20:09.330 --> 20:10.460
What?

20:10.460 --> 20:12.380
Ready?
Almost.

20:12.380 --> 20:14.250
I'm  I'm sorry,
ready  ready for what?

20:14.250 --> 20:16.330
We have plans.

20:16.330 --> 20:18.290
Girls night.
Oh, I get it.

20:18.290 --> 20:19.500
You've seen that I'm fine
on the job,

20:19.500 --> 20:20.920
but you're still
not convinced?

20:20.920 --> 20:23.000
No, that's not it.
We just thought it would be fun.

20:23.000 --> 20:24.790
But if you're not
up for it...

20:24.790 --> 20:27.750
Oh, wait, no, I am.
It's...

20:27.750 --> 20:29.040
You guys have just never
asked me out before.

20:29.040 --> 20:31.210
But that's great.
Uh, cool.

20:31.210 --> 20:33.210
So, where are we going?
A bar?

20:33.210 --> 20:35.670
Club?

20:41.710 --> 20:44.380
Uh, this is a joke,
right? I 

20:44.380 --> 20:46.540
You were right.
I have never gone on a date

20:46.540 --> 20:48.710
with a serial killer,
and you have.

20:48.710 --> 20:50.790
And that would make anyone
question their judgment.

20:50.790 --> 20:53.420
Yeah, sure, but,
uh, this is 
But nothing.

20:53.420 --> 20:55.170
Look, you can never truly know
that you are fine

20:55.170 --> 20:58.000
until you know that you can
trust your judgment again.

20:58.000 --> 21:00.290
So, we're here in this
controlled environment

21:00.290 --> 21:01.670
with zero stakes

21:01.670 --> 21:04.000
so you can meet and evaluate

21:04.000 --> 21:06.330
a succession of men.
If you can
call them "men."

21:06.330 --> 21:08.460
Look, I appreciate what
you're trying to do here.

21:08.460 --> 21:10.790
And actually, it's fairly
psychologically sound,

21:10.790 --> 21:13.540
but this 
this is unnecessary.

21:13.540 --> 21:15.670
Well, it'll just be
a great story for tomorrow.

21:15.670 --> 21:17.620
You are not gonna take "no"
for an answer, are you?

21:17.620 --> 21:21.420
I am just real committed to
getting you to say "yes."

21:25.670 --> 21:27.960
Okay. Fine. Yes.

21:27.960 --> 21:30.380
Great. We will be
sitting over there...

21:30.380 --> 21:32.620
Y
...having just some BYO.

21:32.620 --> 21:36.170
Uh, oh, no. If I'm doing this,
so are you guys.

21:36.170 --> 21:38.880
Can't have a control study
without independent data.

21:38.880 --> 21:41.170
Otherwise how will I know
that my judgment is sound?

21:41.170 --> 21:42.250
She's got a point.

21:42.250 --> 21:44.880
Don't make me pull
the buried alive card.

21:49.080 --> 21:51.880
Screw it, I'm in.

21:57.250 --> 21:59.750
Hey.
Hey.

22:02.420 --> 22:04.670
Well, at the risk of sounding
like my mother,

22:04.670 --> 22:06.540
is that what
you're wearing tonight?

22:06.540 --> 22:07.880
We got that restaurant
opening,

22:07.880 --> 22:10.580
the vodka launch,
the runway show.

22:10.580 --> 22:12.960
I just thought we could
stay in tonight.

22:12.960 --> 22:14.540
I ordered a pizza.

22:14.540 --> 22:16.540
Extra large with
all the toppings.

22:16.540 --> 22:19.210
See, my  my  my PR rep
had to pull massive strings

22:19.210 --> 22:20.420
to get us into
that vodka launch.

22:20.420 --> 22:22.670
Well, I'm not dating
your PR rep,

22:22.670 --> 22:24.960
and I don't care
about vodka launches
and runway shows.

22:26.210 --> 22:28.210
Well, that's not true.
You're right.

22:28.210 --> 22:29.580
I would love to go to
a runway show 

22:29.580 --> 22:31.670
just not tonight.

22:31.670 --> 22:33.080
Okay, hey, hey.

22:33.080 --> 22:34.620
What is going on with you?

22:36.540 --> 22:38.960
Okay, um...

22:38.960 --> 22:40.920
I got recognized at work.

22:40.920 --> 22:42.290
From the red carpet
last night.

22:42.290 --> 22:43.960
That is so cute.
No, it  it's not.

22:43.960 --> 22:45.500
It was a real problem.

22:45.500 --> 22:48.380
Look, Sterling, I have to be
anonymous for my job.

22:48.380 --> 22:50.420
What are you saying?

22:50.420 --> 22:51.670
I don't know.

22:51.670 --> 22:53.960
Look, man, if we could
just stay in tonight,

22:53.960 --> 22:55.540
it would really mean
a lot to me, please.

22:55.540 --> 22:58.290
Look, this PR stuff,
it's part of my job.

22:58.290 --> 23:00.250
It's how I make connections,
stay relevant.

23:01.580 --> 23:05.460
Jackson, don't make me go
without you.

23:05.460 --> 23:06.750
We'll have fun.

23:06.750 --> 23:08.080
Yeah, but we can
have fun here.

23:08.080 --> 23:09.580
I can't.

23:09.580 --> 23:10.750
I have to go.

23:13.210 --> 23:15.830
Okay. Yeah.

23:22.580 --> 23:24.120
Thanks.

23:26.620 --> 23:29.000
For nothing.

23:31.580 --> 23:32.460
You ready?

23:32.460 --> 23:34.040
Uh...

23:34.040 --> 23:35.540
Can I...?
Mm.

23:35.540 --> 23:37.080
Thanks.

23:44.540 --> 23:46.250
Okay, let's do this.

23:46.250 --> 23:48.380
Do you ever have
any intrusive thoughts?

23:49.670 --> 23:51.750
I mean, I know it's not
"PC" to say,

23:51.750 --> 23:53.580
but women are paid less

23:53.580 --> 23:55.380
because they just naturally
take fewer risks.

23:56.460 --> 23:58.540
So there I was,
wandering the crash site,

23:58.540 --> 23:59.790
carrying this guy's leg...

23:59.790 --> 24:01.830
Mm-hmm.

24:01.830 --> 24:03.960
Did you have any early
behavioral issues?

24:03.960 --> 24:05.750
How would you describe your
relationship with your mom?

24:05.750 --> 24:08.710
And would you submit yourself
to a full background check?

24:08.710 --> 24:10.790
If not, um, why?

24:12.830 --> 24:15.290
Ah, ah, ah, ah.
Don't say anything.

24:15.290 --> 24:17.880
Let's just sit here
until the timer goes off.

24:18.960 --> 24:20.580
Anyway,
I learned my lesson.

24:20.580 --> 24:23.380
Don't wear open-toed shoes
to a crime scene.

24:24.380 --> 24:25.710
Okay.

24:27.460 --> 24:28.710
She did good.
Yeah.

24:28.710 --> 24:31.290
This has actually been
really interesting.

24:31.290 --> 24:32.420
I feel like I learned
something about myself.

24:32.420 --> 24:34.040
That's great.

24:35.330 --> 24:36.920
Oh, you have a string
coming...

24:39.380 --> 24:41.380
Hey, hey, it's okay.
It's okay.

24:43.040 --> 24:45.290
You know, you really shouldn't
touch a woman without asking,

24:45.290 --> 24:47.210
but, you know, we don't need
to make a thing of it, right?

24:47.210 --> 24:49.250
Are you okay?
What happened?

24:59.460 --> 25:01.170
Good morning.

25:05.000 --> 25:06.710
How are you feeling?

25:06.710 --> 25:09.000
Just gearing up for a day of
country clubs and wedding halls.

25:09.000 --> 25:10.290
I mean,
how are you feeling

25:10.290 --> 25:12.460
about the "not becoming a cop"
situation?

25:12.460 --> 25:13.920
I'm fine.

25:13.920 --> 25:15.750
It's not the first time
I lost out on something

25:15.750 --> 25:17.500
because of what happened.

25:17.500 --> 25:19.750
And it won't be the last.
Abigail 

25:19.750 --> 25:20.960
I'm gonna take a shower.

25:20.960 --> 25:22.710
Hey. Good morning.

25:22.710 --> 25:24.960
Morning.

25:24.960 --> 25:26.290
She's heartbroken,
you know.

25:26.290 --> 25:27.330
Yeah, I know.

25:27.330 --> 25:29.790
But, uh, I think
it's for the best.

25:31.500 --> 25:33.620
Henry, I-I'm disappointed
you feel that way.

25:33.620 --> 25:35.120
You love her,

25:35.120 --> 25:37.670
but you're rooting
against her?

25:37.670 --> 25:40.330
All because you can't handle
the idea of her being in danger.

25:40.330 --> 25:43.330
Okay, Dad, that's not fair.
I'm trying to protect her.

25:43.330 --> 25:45.330
Deciding what's best for
her is not protecting her 

25:45.330 --> 25:46.830
that's controlling her.

25:46.830 --> 25:48.250
And you're better
than that.

25:48.250 --> 25:50.380
I shouldn't have played along
yesterday, and that's on me.

25:50.380 --> 25:52.420
But I would be a failure
as a father

25:52.420 --> 25:55.290
if I didn't tell you you're
falling down as a fiancÃ©.

25:55.290 --> 25:58.170
Abigail deserves your empathy
and your honesty.

26:00.120 --> 26:02.380
You can't give her that,
you should tell her it's over.

26:09.540 --> 26:11.210
Uh, yeah?

26:11.210 --> 26:12.380
I don't feel so good.

26:12.380 --> 26:14.170
Aw.

26:14.170 --> 26:16.210
Did you eat
that whole pizza?

26:16.210 --> 26:17.790
I went for a slice
when I got home,

26:17.790 --> 26:19.380
but the box was empty.

26:19.380 --> 26:20.620
Worse.

26:20.620 --> 26:22.670
I spent the whole
night in bed,

26:22.670 --> 26:24.880
shame-eating while I refreshed
Sterling's Instagram feed.

26:24.880 --> 26:27.120
Oh, no.
FOMO overload?

26:27.120 --> 26:28.830
Oh, yeah,
you have no idea.

26:28.830 --> 26:30.830
Red carpets, gift bags,

26:30.830 --> 26:33.080
and guess who Sterling sat
next to at the fashion show 

26:33.080 --> 26:34.880
Hmm?
Lady Gaga.

26:34.880 --> 26:36.330
Oh, my God.
And you missed her?

26:36.330 --> 26:37.880
I know.
Ohh.

26:37.880 --> 26:39.290
That's when I ordered
another pizza.

26:39.290 --> 26:41.710
I'm sorry, what?
You  You ate two pizzas?

26:41.710 --> 26:43.540
Mm, it sounds so bad
when you say it out loud.

26:43.540 --> 26:47.540
And completely unsustainable
as a coping mechanism.

26:47.540 --> 26:50.040
Aw.

26:50.040 --> 26:51.080
What are you gonna do?

26:52.880 --> 26:54.750
I think I have to
break up with him.

26:54.750 --> 26:56.500
I'm sorry.

26:56.500 --> 26:58.250
Yeah, me too.

26:58.250 --> 27:00.040
Just, I like him.

27:00.040 --> 27:01.670
Like, a lot.

27:01.670 --> 27:03.080
Well, on the bright side,

27:03.080 --> 27:05.040
you won't be alone
in being alone.

27:05.040 --> 27:07.420
You know,
we can FOMO together.

27:07.420 --> 27:08.420
Okay.

27:12.920 --> 27:15.710
Hey.
You seen Nolan?

27:15.710 --> 27:18.080
Not yet. Hey, Lucy had
a bit of a moment

27:18.080 --> 27:19.500
last night
when we were out.

27:19.500 --> 27:20.880
It's  It's not a big deal.
She's fine.

27:20.880 --> 27:22.420
What the hell
is Harper doing?
Helping.

27:22.420 --> 27:24.620
Don't get all "Tim" on me.
I just thought you should know.

27:24.620 --> 27:26.170
Lucy's okay?

27:26.170 --> 27:27.880
She will be.

27:27.880 --> 27:29.670
Alright.
Thanks for letting me know.

27:31.790 --> 27:33.170
Nolan, I got something.

27:33.170 --> 27:34.040
Me too.
Who goes first?

27:34.040 --> 27:35.420
I do.

27:35.420 --> 27:37.000
Listen,
Medical Examiner called.

27:37.000 --> 27:38.210
Heston Dayton
wasn't a jumper.

27:38.210 --> 27:39.960
Pushed?
More like tossed.

27:39.960 --> 27:41.330
He was dead
before he left the roof.

27:41.330 --> 27:42.420
Strangled.

27:42.420 --> 27:44.290
Weirdly,
he also had acid burns

27:44.290 --> 27:45.830
on his forearms,
less than a week old.

27:45.830 --> 27:47.170
Well, funny you should
say that.

27:47.170 --> 27:49.460
I looked up the arrest records
for Everest Jones.

27:49.460 --> 27:51.920
His burglary charge was
for stealing drain cleaner,

27:51.920 --> 27:53.290
which contains
sulfuric acid.

27:53.290 --> 27:54.670
Which is used
to cook meth.

27:54.670 --> 27:55.960
You think they were cooking it
in the trailer park?

27:55.960 --> 27:57.580
No.
We'd have smelled it.

27:57.580 --> 27:59.040
So, what now? We bring
the detectives up to speed?

27:59.040 --> 28:02.500
Not yet.
Let's go to Everest first.

28:02.500 --> 28:05.750
I know what you're thinking,
but I'm fine.

28:05.750 --> 28:07.210
You nearly broke
that guy's arm.

28:07.210 --> 28:09.000
I was just doing what they
taught us in the Academy.

28:09.000 --> 28:11.040
React quickly.
Subdue the threat.

28:12.710 --> 28:16.540
He was picking a piece of
thread off of your shirt.

28:16.540 --> 28:17.710
And you got triggered.

28:17.710 --> 28:19.710
Yeah, well, what do
you know about it?

28:27.170 --> 28:30.210
Come on.

28:30.210 --> 28:32.040
When you're undercover,

28:32.040 --> 28:34.120
you can't let go
for even a second.

28:34.120 --> 28:36.210
You have to maintain
complete control

28:36.210 --> 28:37.460
over your responses,

28:37.460 --> 28:39.250
read between every glance.

28:39.250 --> 28:41.290
It is physically,
mentally,

28:41.290 --> 28:43.290
and emotionally
exhausting.

28:43.290 --> 28:45.420
Okay, and, what,
you slipped up,

28:45.420 --> 28:47.500
and one of them figured out
you were a cop?

28:47.500 --> 28:48.920
What?

28:54.210 --> 28:56.000
I always met my case officer
at a bar.

28:57.420 --> 28:59.420
It was the one place
that I could go

28:59.420 --> 29:02.290
where I could drop
the character,

29:02.290 --> 29:04.880
and I could
stop strategizing

29:04.880 --> 29:08.120
and just have a beer
and be myself.

29:08.120 --> 29:09.580
So, one night,

29:09.580 --> 29:12.580
one beer turned into two,
which turned into 

29:12.580 --> 29:15.750
Well, I lost count.

29:15.750 --> 29:18.580
And if it were
any other scenario,

29:18.580 --> 29:21.330
I would have sobered up,
I would've cut myself off,

29:21.330 --> 29:22.830
but...

29:27.290 --> 29:28.960
I wasn't with the crooks.

29:30.670 --> 29:32.500
I was with another cop.

29:35.620 --> 29:37.170
And I trusted him.

29:45.250 --> 29:47.210
I'm so sorry.

29:47.210 --> 29:49.580
Yeah, it was
a long time ago, but...

29:52.290 --> 29:55.500
...my point is...

29:55.500 --> 29:57.880
I shut down.

29:57.880 --> 30:00.620
I didn't even tell
my husband.

30:00.620 --> 30:02.170
I just 
I kept telling myself

30:02.170 --> 30:04.750
that I would deal with it
when I was ready.

30:04.750 --> 30:07.170
But with every passing week,
it just got worse.

30:07.170 --> 30:10.790
Maybe I pushed you
too hard last night.

30:12.620 --> 30:14.120
But I know what it is like

30:14.120 --> 30:16.000
when you do not
face things head-on.

30:18.210 --> 30:19.210
Hey.

30:20.420 --> 30:22.500
Yeah?

30:22.500 --> 30:25.620
You're gonna
get through this.

30:25.620 --> 30:26.620
I promise.

30:32.790 --> 30:34.620
What  What happened
to him?

30:34.620 --> 30:36.330
Your case officer.

30:36.330 --> 30:39.120
He fell down a flight
of stairs a few times,

30:39.120 --> 30:42.460
had to take
a disability pension.

30:46.500 --> 30:48.670
You and Chen
are close, right?

30:48.670 --> 30:50.710
Yeah, I'd say so.

30:50.710 --> 30:52.000
How's she doing?

30:52.000 --> 30:54.460
I mean, really doing?

30:54.460 --> 30:55.960
She's good.

30:55.960 --> 30:57.790
Really.

30:57.790 --> 31:00.960
I think she'll be better once
she gets that tattoo removed.

31:00.960 --> 31:02.710
Can you imagine that 

31:02.710 --> 31:04.830
walking around every day,
branded by the worst thing

31:04.830 --> 31:06.080
that's ever
happened to you?

31:06.080 --> 31:07.500
You think because
it's physical, it's worse?

31:07.500 --> 31:10.460
Tragedies
always leave scars 

31:10.460 --> 31:12.420
only some of them
you can see.

31:19.710 --> 31:21.290
Well, that can't be good.

31:21.290 --> 31:23.040
We saw two Dead Bastards
leaving the park

31:23.040 --> 31:24.710
when we pulled in
there yesterday.

31:24.710 --> 31:26.000
Can't be a coincidence.
Let me guess 
they sell a little meth?

31:26.000 --> 31:27.670
A lot of meth.

31:27.670 --> 31:29.500
And they wouldn't take kindly
to a couple of idiots

31:29.500 --> 31:31.250
trying to cook and sell
in their territory.

31:31.250 --> 31:33.040
So, they chuck Heston
off of a roof,

31:33.040 --> 31:34.880
come back by the park
to do the same to Everest,

31:34.880 --> 31:36.250
but leave when they see us.

31:36.250 --> 31:37.960
Yeah, but now they came back
to finish the job.

31:37.960 --> 31:40.080
Confiscate any product
or cash they find on site.

31:40.080 --> 31:41.540
So, what's our next move?

31:41.540 --> 31:42.790
We call in the cavalry

31:42.790 --> 31:44.460
and hope nobody gets killed
while we're waiting.

31:49.500 --> 31:51.540
7-Adam-15,
in position for recon.

31:51.540 --> 31:52.540
Stand by
for tactical assessment.

31:52.540 --> 31:53.750
Roger that. We just landed

31:53.750 --> 31:54.830
at the staging area
around the corner 

31:54.830 --> 31:56.540
SWAT's mobilizing,

31:56.540 --> 31:58.380
but I'm not sure we can
wait around for them to land.

31:58.380 --> 31:59.920
Set up an OP and then report
back to me.

32:00.830 --> 32:02.920
Okay, Bradford and Nolan

32:02.920 --> 32:05.040
are hopping the wall
to give us eyes inside.

32:05.040 --> 32:07.120
Get ready to move out.

32:40.210 --> 32:41.710
Oh!

32:41.710 --> 32:43.210
Get back here.

32:48.420 --> 32:50.960
Get him up.
Get him back inside.

32:52.250 --> 32:54.330
Sarge, this thing
is going south fast.

32:54.330 --> 32:56.040
I definitely don't think
we can wait for SWAT.

32:56.040 --> 32:58.290
Copy that.
You two proceed to target.

33:00.880 --> 33:02.420
That's my truck.

33:02.420 --> 33:04.000
What?

33:04.000 --> 33:05.330
I lent it
to Abigail and Henry

33:05.330 --> 33:06.290
to go take a look
at wedding venues.

33:07.500 --> 33:08.500
Are you sure?

33:08.500 --> 33:10.250
Yes.

33:10.250 --> 33:12.040
They must've come here
to see Ellen.

33:12.040 --> 33:14.210
Abigail was talking
about her last night.

33:15.210 --> 33:17.170
Sarge, we got
a new situation.

33:20.750 --> 33:22.170
Where'd he cook?

33:22.170 --> 33:24.000
I don't know.
Try again.

33:24.000 --> 33:24.880
-Hey, hey, hey, hey.

33:24.880 --> 33:26.040
-Sit down!
-Stop, stop!

33:26.040 --> 33:27.580
She doesn't know anything.

33:27.580 --> 33:30.420
Okay, how about you?
You know where the kid cooked?

33:30.420 --> 33:31.670
Where he kept the cash?

33:31.670 --> 33:34.040
No.
Man, we don't
know anything.

33:34.040 --> 33:36.580
We're just  We're just in the
wrong place at the wrong time.

33:36.580 --> 33:38.120
Lot of that going around.

33:41.670 --> 33:44.500
People wandering into territory
they got no business in.

33:44.500 --> 33:46.500
Messages got to get sent.

33:46.500 --> 33:47.670
You killed my brother.

33:47.670 --> 33:49.330
Nah, he killed himself,
really,

33:49.330 --> 33:50.540
by being stupid enough

33:50.540 --> 33:52.620
to wander into the middle
of a criminal enterprise

33:52.620 --> 33:56.210
like a turkey staring up
at the rain and then drowning.

33:56.210 --> 33:58.750
That's a myth, actually.

33:58.750 --> 34:00.880
What's that?
Turkeys don't actually
do that 

34:00.880 --> 34:02.830
look up at the rain
and drown.
Okay, okay.

34:02.830 --> 34:04.210
Well, if somebody
don't start telling me

34:04.210 --> 34:06.120
what it is
I need to know right now,

34:06.120 --> 34:09.210
then Big Death is gonna
drown you in the toilet.

34:12.620 --> 34:13.540
We're in position.

34:13.540 --> 34:14.710
All units  Green Light.

34:14.710 --> 34:16.580
I repeat, Green Light.

34:39.710 --> 34:40.960
Drop your guns now!

34:40.960 --> 34:42.000
Get on your stomach!

34:42.000 --> 34:43.540
Arms out, palms up!

34:43.540 --> 34:45.580
-Now!
-Get down, get down.

35:16.330 --> 35:17.120
I thought you checked
the place.

35:17.120 --> 35:19.960
I did.
Check it again.

35:31.830 --> 35:33.670
What the hell are you
doing back there?

35:44.670 --> 35:46.040
Go, go, go, go, go!

35:46.040 --> 35:47.540
Get on the ground now!

35:47.540 --> 35:49.250
-Get on the ground!
-Get down!

35:49.250 --> 35:50.960
-Right now!
-Get on the ground!

35:50.960 --> 35:52.710
-Clear?

35:52.710 --> 35:54.460
All clear.

35:54.460 --> 35:55.790
You got him?
Got him.

35:55.790 --> 35:57.460
Hey, you okay?
What?

35:57.460 --> 35:58.880
He asked
if we were okay.

35:58.880 --> 35:59.880
What?!

35:59.880 --> 36:02.000
Come here. Come here.

36:04.080 --> 36:06.380
Police!

36:06.380 --> 36:07.540
Stop where you are!

36:07.540 --> 36:08.750
Down on your knees.

36:08.750 --> 36:10.710
Hands behind your head,
fingers laced. Don't move.

36:10.710 --> 36:12.670
7-Adam-19,
two suspects in custody.

36:12.670 --> 36:14.170
Code 4.

36:33.080 --> 36:35.040
What?
It's totally your fault.

36:35.040 --> 36:36.580
What? This is my fault?
How is this my fault?
This is all your fault!

36:36.580 --> 36:38.420
Because I like going out?
Are you crazy?

36:38.420 --> 36:39.250
You're the one
that's putting your job

36:39.250 --> 36:40.290
ahead of our relationship.

36:40.290 --> 36:41.460
Because it is not
a relationship!

36:41.460 --> 36:42.580
I'm just arm candy to you

36:42.580 --> 36:43.960
to all your celebrity
responsibilities.

36:43.960 --> 36:45.580
How can you say that?
Because it's true.

36:45.580 --> 36:48.380
Well, if you're so unhappy,
then walk away, okay?

36:48.380 --> 36:50.380
I'm not gonna stop you.
I know you won't.

36:50.380 --> 36:52.080
That's why it's over.
Fine.

37:02.620 --> 37:04.120
You okay?

37:04.120 --> 37:06.000
Yeah. That was hard.

37:07.880 --> 37:08.880
Ah!

37:08.880 --> 37:10.750
That was awesome!

37:12.170 --> 37:13.620
Honestly, I'm glad we didn't get
a chance to rehearse,

37:13.620 --> 37:15.210
'cause the first take,
always the best.

37:15.210 --> 37:16.420
I know, right? I mean,
you were such a good actor,

37:16.420 --> 37:18.040
I totally believed you
were breaking up with me.

37:18.040 --> 37:19.920
Dude, you were incredible.
In fact, you were so good,

37:19.920 --> 37:21.380
I could probably get you
a guest role on the show.

37:21.380 --> 37:22.620
Aww.
That's so sweet.

37:22.620 --> 37:24.670
Yeah.
Focus!

37:24.670 --> 37:27.290
The public breakup was meant to
get you out of the spotlight.

37:27.290 --> 37:29.000
And as long as you guys
stay off the radar,

37:29.000 --> 37:31.170
Jackson's choices in
the department stay open.

37:31.170 --> 37:33.250
Right. Sorry.
Uh, got carried away.

37:33.250 --> 37:34.330
Well, that's 'cause
you're passionate.

37:34.330 --> 37:36.040
That's what
I dig about you.
Aww.

37:36.040 --> 37:38.250
Hey, uh, you got any of that
pizza left at your place?

37:38.250 --> 37:39.580
I'm starving.

37:41.420 --> 37:43.000
What's so funny?

37:43.000 --> 37:44.250
Can we go?

37:46.790 --> 37:48.040
I finally found
the one thing

37:48.040 --> 37:49.580
that makes me not
want to be a cop.

37:49.580 --> 37:52.380
Yes. The paperwork
is a bitch.

37:52.380 --> 37:54.670
Who's a bitch?
Oh, you're my bitch.

37:54.670 --> 37:56.210
Okay.
Can we go home now?

37:56.210 --> 37:58.460
Uh, I have another
30 minutes here,

37:58.460 --> 37:59.380
but you guys
should take off.

37:59.380 --> 38:01.170
I'll meet you at home.
Sure.

38:03.330 --> 38:05.000
Today was scary.

38:05.000 --> 38:06.540
Yes, it was.

38:06.540 --> 38:08.000
Yeah, you're used to it,
though, right?

38:08.000 --> 38:10.040
Used to it?
No, no, no.

38:10.040 --> 38:12.290
Especially not with
you two in danger.

38:12.290 --> 38:15.040
But we're trained to
deal with our fear.

38:15.040 --> 38:16.170
You know, most people operate

38:16.170 --> 38:18.040
in fairly conflict-free
environments.

38:18.040 --> 38:20.960
So, when something
shocking happens,

38:20.960 --> 38:24.330
they're overwhelmed,
and they panic or freeze.

38:24.330 --> 38:26.250
Everyone has a plan until
they get punched in the mouth.

38:26.250 --> 38:29.040
Exactly. And cops
are a little used to

38:29.040 --> 38:30.380
getting punched
in the mouth.

38:30.380 --> 38:32.670
Conflict is literally in
the job description, so...

38:32.670 --> 38:36.080
We try to recognize fear
and not let it paralyze us.

38:36.080 --> 38:37.540
I never thought
about it that way.

38:37.540 --> 38:40.960
My man didn't freeze when
the bullets started flying.

38:40.960 --> 38:43.120
He jumped on top of me.
My hero.

38:44.750 --> 38:46.420
I'm not a hero.

38:46.420 --> 38:48.420
Um, I have to
tell you something.

38:48.420 --> 38:52.210
I wasn't supportive of you
wanting to be a cop.

38:52.210 --> 38:55.250
I asked my dad if he could
scare you straight.

38:55.250 --> 38:59.120
And he called me out
for being selfish 

38:59.120 --> 39:00.540
and he was right.

39:00.540 --> 39:02.880
Oh.

39:02.880 --> 39:05.830
Look, you deserve
so much better,

39:05.830 --> 39:07.500
and, uh, I'll understand

39:07.500 --> 39:09.670
if you don't want to
marry me anymore.

39:16.580 --> 39:18.790
That escalated
quickly.

39:18.790 --> 39:21.500
You're not 
not upset?

39:21.500 --> 39:24.170
A little.

39:24.170 --> 39:26.500
I don't know why you didn't
just say something.

39:26.500 --> 39:29.920
But I get it.

39:29.920 --> 39:32.290
I'm a bit of a wildcard.

39:32.290 --> 39:33.830
You grew up in
a stable home

39:33.830 --> 39:36.420
with parents
who believed in you.

39:36.420 --> 39:38.420
I'm used to people
underestimating me.

39:40.290 --> 39:41.580
I just didn't think
you were one of them.

39:43.670 --> 39:46.880
But we'll work through it.

39:46.880 --> 39:48.580
You're not getting
rid of me that easily.

39:48.580 --> 39:49.750
Thank God.

39:52.420 --> 39:54.960
Proud of you.
Proud of both of you.

39:54.960 --> 39:57.120
And I think we should celebrate

39:57.120 --> 40:00.830
Henry's newfound maturity 
with pie.

40:00.830 --> 40:02.460
Now you're talking.
Wait, wait.

40:02.460 --> 40:03.830
Don't you have to
finish your paperwork?

40:03.830 --> 40:05.040
I'll come in early tomorrow.

40:17.750 --> 40:19.210
Hey. Hi.

40:19.210 --> 40:20.880
You got no quit in you,
do you, Boot?

40:20.880 --> 40:22.960
No, sir.
I get that from you.

40:22.960 --> 40:24.380
I don't think so.

40:24.380 --> 40:26.250
You walked in the door
this way.

40:26.250 --> 40:27.420
It's what makes you
so aggravating.

40:28.790 --> 40:30.290
I'm taking that
as a compliment.

40:30.290 --> 40:32.120
It was meant to be.

40:32.120 --> 40:33.170
You have a good night.

40:33.170 --> 40:34.460
Yeah, you too.

40:39.790 --> 40:41.080
You know...

40:43.920 --> 40:45.380
I got half a dozen scars.

40:45.380 --> 40:48.420
Bullet wounds, knife wounds,
broken bottle.

40:48.420 --> 40:50.580
Then there's the ones
you can't see 

40:50.580 --> 40:52.290
Isabel's addiction,

40:52.290 --> 40:55.830
a dad who would tune me up
on the regular.

40:55.830 --> 40:59.080
And whether I like it or not,
they're a part of me.

40:59.080 --> 41:01.330
I-I know what you're
trying to do,

41:01.330 --> 41:04.710
and I appreciate it,
but this is different.

41:04.710 --> 41:06.120
I was tattooed
by a sadist

41:06.120 --> 41:09.170
who etched my day of death
into my skin.

41:09.170 --> 41:11.210
Okay, but you didn't die.
Okay? You lived.

41:11.210 --> 41:12.580
And now he's the one
in the ground.

41:12.580 --> 41:14.120
But 

41:14.120 --> 41:16.380
I'm not trying to tell you
what to do with it.

41:16.380 --> 41:20.040
Okay? Burn it off, keep it,
whatever gives you peace.

41:20.040 --> 41:24.170
All I'm trying to do is give you
some hard-won perspective.

41:24.170 --> 41:26.210
You can choose
to see that tattoo

41:26.210 --> 41:28.080
as your greatest failure.

41:29.460 --> 41:31.830
But I see it as proof
that you're a survivor.

41:33.380 --> 41:36.120
It wasn't your day of death,
Officer Chen.

41:36.120 --> 41:40.250
It was the first day
of the rest of your life.

41:40.250 --> 41:42.250
And no one can
take that away from you.

41:45.500 --> 41:48.380
Thanks.
Yeah.

41:48.380 --> 41:49.540
You're welcome.

41:51.920 --> 41:52.920
You riding with me
tomorrow?

41:54.670 --> 41:56.330
Yes, sir.

41:56.330 --> 41:58.210
Good.
Get in early.

41:58.210 --> 41:59.750
War bags need restocking.

42:00.305 --> 42:06.912
