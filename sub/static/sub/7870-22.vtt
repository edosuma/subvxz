BART: All right!

11:13.673 --> 11:16.092
Lie Smeller!
Lie Smeller!

11:16.175 --> 11:18.511
(sobbing)

11:18.594 --> 11:20.596
Does everybody love themselves?

11:20.680 --> 11:22.973
(crowd cheers)

11:23.057 --> 11:25.935
That kind of thing sounds
hollow from anyone but you!

11:28.729 --> 11:30.356
Now, we have to get going.

11:30.439 --> 11:32.775
Wait a minute. No.

11:32.858 --> 11:34.485
No, no! (moans)

11:34.568 --> 11:36.195
(sings powerful melody)

11:40.241 --> 11:41.867
GAGA: You!

11:41.951 --> 11:43.202
What's wrong, honey?

11:43.285 --> 11:46.956
Please, I've had enough
attention for one day!

11:47.039 --> 11:50.793
Yo, lighting! I can't see the girl
who's had enough attention.

11:53.629 --> 11:55.715
We should go
to your house and talk.

11:55.798 --> 11:57.466
Incognito!

11:57.550 --> 11:58.926
Oh, God.

12:00.177 --> 12:02.972
Psst! It's me, Gaga.

12:03.055 --> 12:04.640
But no one must know.

12:04.724 --> 12:06.642
<i>HOODIE VOICE CHIP:</i>
<i>Gaga. Gaga. Gaga.</i>

12:06.726 --> 12:11.397
So peaceful. Just the buzzing
of the paparazzi.

12:11.480 --> 12:13.232
(cameras snapping)

12:13.315 --> 12:14.984
Hey, Gary.
How's your wife and kids?

12:15.067 --> 12:17.403
Still ashamed of me.
Big smile!

12:17.486 --> 12:19.155
This is where I live.

12:19.238 --> 12:21.240
Well, hello.

12:21.323 --> 12:23.701
It's one of those
music industry superstars

12:23.784 --> 12:26.078
who's turning our innocent children
into ladies of the night.

12:26.162 --> 12:28.247
What sweater drawer
did you crawl out of?

12:28.330 --> 12:31.083
(chuckles) Name's Ned Flanders.
I've heard of you.

12:31.167 --> 12:34.253
Haven't seen so much skin since
shedding season on a snake farm.

12:34.336 --> 12:36.922
But all I'm saying
is that everyone is beautiful...

12:37.006 --> 12:39.550
Yes, but Jesus said that...

12:39.633 --> 12:41.177
pretty much the same thing.

12:41.260 --> 12:43.512
Darn it, the Bible said
the Devil would be attractive.

12:43.596 --> 12:45.639
What makes you think
I'm the Devil?

12:48.350 --> 12:51.353
Unless you're gonna slap some
wieners on those, turn 'em off.

12:52.229 --> 12:54.273
Joke's on you; I needed a trim.

12:56.609 --> 13:00.446
(Gaga groaning)

13:02.490 --> 13:04.158
Bastards!

13:04.241 --> 13:06.577
Lisa, look at me.

13:06.660 --> 13:09.747
So what if your number one
supporter is you.

13:09.830 --> 13:11.499
That's how it should be.

13:11.582 --> 13:13.584
I had some
very tough times myself

13:13.667 --> 13:16.420
before I became
a superstar at age 22.

13:16.504 --> 13:19.548
Everything is gonna be fine.
You better yet?

13:19.632 --> 13:22.802
-(phone chimes)
-Sorry, gotta answer this text.

13:22.885 --> 13:24.345
Please, take your time.

13:26.180 --> 13:27.515
You know what you need?

13:27.598 --> 13:30.100
-Solitude?
-Flash mob!

13:33.604 --> 13:36.524
Now, Lisa, if that didn't
fundamentally change

13:36.607 --> 13:38.651
who you are,
I don't know what.

13:45.115 --> 13:47.701
You idiots!
She meant we should disperse.

13:50.955 --> 13:54.083
Lisa, you un-tattooed
little miracle,

13:54.166 --> 13:58.254
I'm not leaving here until
I restore your sense of hope.

13:58.337 --> 14:02.508
Let me explain. I have a chance
for a grim but tolerable life,

14:02.591 --> 14:04.218
but only if I give up hope.

14:04.301 --> 14:07.596
Now if you don't mind,
and with all due worship,

14:07.680 --> 14:09.265
I would like to be alone.

14:09.348 --> 14:13.102
Lady Gaga, meet your biggest
threat: Baby Googoo.

14:15.062 --> 14:16.981
Can I please be alone?

14:28.367 --> 14:30.494
Well, it worked once.

14:37.209 --> 14:39.753
-So, any ideas about Lisa?
-(sighs)

14:39.837 --> 14:42.882
I never have any idea
what to do for Lisa.

14:42.965 --> 14:45.718
To be the mother of someone
who's so smart

14:45.801 --> 14:49.763
and so sensitive and who
beautifully plays an instrument

14:49.847 --> 14:52.391
(whispers)
I don't really care for,

14:52.474 --> 14:54.810
(sobbing)
it's so hard.

14:55.811 --> 14:57.313
I wish I was one of those

14:57.396 --> 14:59.481
young women who could
just wave their hands

14:59.565 --> 15:01.483
in front
of their eyes and not cry,

15:01.567 --> 15:03.736
because it doesn't
work for me.

15:03.819 --> 15:04.987
-(yells)
-Marge...

15:05.070 --> 15:06.322
-(yells)
-Ah...

15:06.405 --> 15:08.073
-Ooh! Aah! Ooh!
-Marge. Marge.

15:08.157 --> 15:09.074
-Marge.
-Hm...

15:09.158 --> 15:11.201
-Marge, take it easy.
-(groans)

15:11.285 --> 15:12.828
It's just human contact.

15:12.912 --> 15:16.457
I'm afraid handholding
isn't going to cheer me up.

15:16.540 --> 15:18.709
Well, maybe this will.

15:21.962 --> 15:23.339
Homer!

15:23.422 --> 15:24.840
Wow. Wow.

15:24.924 --> 15:28.510
This is like the night Hillary
won the New Hampshire Primary.

15:31.138 --> 15:33.098
Lisa snuck out.

15:33.182 --> 15:34.725
I'm going after her.
(Homer grunting)

15:34.808 --> 15:37.519
-What are you gonna say?
-HOMER: Whoo! Mm.

15:37.603 --> 15:39.688
I'll just tell her that...

15:39.772 --> 15:40.856
Stop it, Homer!

15:40.940 --> 15:43.609
Some of that meat is me.
Can I just trim the hem?

15:43.692 --> 15:45.361
(groans) It's yours.

15:49.531 --> 15:51.200
Oh, good. She's playing.

15:51.283 --> 15:54.370
Not so good.
It's "Lisa Roulette."

15:54.453 --> 15:56.372
(kids shouting)
Don't let her get you!

15:57.456 --> 15:59.959
Her eyes shoot loser lasers!

16:00.042 --> 16:01.710
(feigns gasping)

16:04.588 --> 16:05.965
(chanting)
There is no over-the-top.

16:06.048 --> 16:07.591
There is no over-the-top.

16:07.675 --> 16:08.884
Run!

16:08.968 --> 16:13.263
With an egg that big, there's
gotta be an even bigger chicken!

16:14.848 --> 16:16.850
Lisa?

16:16.934 --> 16:19.687
Lisa, listen to me.

16:19.770 --> 16:22.898
This pity party's being shut
down by the smile police.

16:22.982 --> 16:24.692
Here's what you're gonna do.

16:24.775 --> 16:26.735
Why do you keep telling me
what I'm gonna do?

16:26.819 --> 16:28.529
This isn't about me.

16:28.612 --> 16:31.198
-Well, who else would it be about?
-You!

16:31.281 --> 16:34.743
It's about
"Hello, hello, Springfield."

16:34.827 --> 16:36.620
"It's me, Gaga!"

16:36.704 --> 16:39.790
"Why is everyone looking
at my purple hair

16:39.873 --> 16:41.542
full of bluebirds?"

16:42.793 --> 16:45.295
-Well, I denounce thee!
-Wha...?

16:45.379 --> 16:48.590
I denounce thee for giving people
ambitions they cannot fulfill.

16:48.674 --> 16:50.426
And I denounce thee
for positing a world

16:50.509 --> 16:53.887
where social acceptance
and walking on heels are easy!

16:53.971 --> 16:56.473
Please, may we kill the kid?

16:56.557 --> 16:58.767
I denounce thee!
I denounce thee!

16:58.851 --> 17:00.269
I denounce thee!

17:00.352 --> 17:02.938
Whoa, easy, little monster.

17:03.022 --> 17:05.441
Don't "monster" me.

17:05.524 --> 17:06.358
(all gasp)

17:07.234 --> 17:08.736
Whatever you say.

17:08.819 --> 17:10.112
(sobbing)

17:12.906 --> 17:14.616
Are you crying... glitter?

17:14.700 --> 17:16.076
Tiny diamonds.
(sobs)

17:16.160 --> 17:17.953
Hurts like hell.

17:18.037 --> 17:21.582
(chanting)
Gaga, Gaga, Gaga, Gaga...

17:25.586 --> 17:29.006
HOMER: Okay Lisa, coming up
to make things better!

17:29.089 --> 17:31.967
(grunting)
Okay, I'm almost there.

17:32.051 --> 17:33.969
Upward, ever upward.

17:34.053 --> 17:35.846
(panting)
Stay hydrated...

17:35.929 --> 17:38.015
Oh, I'm on the wrong tree!

17:38.098 --> 17:40.142
(grunts)
Okay, try again.

17:40.225 --> 17:41.852
Here we go. Up again.

17:41.935 --> 17:44.980
(grunting and panting)
Oh... Lisa, can you come down?

17:48.108 --> 17:49.610
Sweetie, I've been thinking.

17:49.693 --> 17:52.112
Now, this all started
because you used a fake name

17:52.196 --> 17:54.364
to defend yourself.

17:54.448 --> 17:57.117
The problem's not
that you were cheating.

17:58.118 --> 18:00.412
It's that you got caught.

18:01.497 --> 18:05.000
I cheat on my diet,
but nobody knows

18:05.084 --> 18:07.377
'cause the damage
is on the inside,

18:07.461 --> 18:10.047
and the first warning sign
is sudden death.

18:10.130 --> 18:11.882
So, honey, what do you say?

18:11.965 --> 18:13.884
Dad, thank you!

18:13.967 --> 18:16.303
Like always, the fact
that I could tune you out

18:16.386 --> 18:18.514
without fearing I'd miss out
on something

18:18.597 --> 18:20.974
gave me the time
to take stock and realize

18:21.058 --> 18:22.893
how ungrateful I have been.

18:22.976 --> 18:25.938
Which means,
I've got a train to catch.

18:26.021 --> 18:28.273
(chuckling)
Parenting.

18:28.357 --> 18:32.402
It's the one job you know
you're always doing right.

18:32.486 --> 18:36.323
So long, Springfield.
You are my Waterloo.

18:36.406 --> 18:38.075
(crowd cheers)

18:38.158 --> 18:41.745
And now I'm just going to lie
in bed and eat Fruit Roll-Ups.

18:41.829 --> 18:44.414
Why is she doing in defeat
what I do in victory?

18:44.498 --> 18:45.833
(whistle blowing)

18:45.916 --> 18:48.335
(chugging)

18:49.169 --> 18:50.254
Gaga!

18:50.337 --> 18:51.255
Lisa?

18:51.338 --> 18:52.589
Why are you here?

18:52.673 --> 18:54.842
-To thank you.
-For what?

18:54.925 --> 18:56.718
Look at me!
You did help me

18:56.802 --> 18:59.263
by allowing me
to inappropriately focus

18:59.346 --> 19:02.099
eight years of rage
and rejection on you.

19:02.182 --> 19:04.268
It was like a great sneeze.

19:04.351 --> 19:06.353
And now I can say
what's good about me.

19:06.436 --> 19:08.730
And I can say it
as Lisa Simpson!

19:08.814 --> 19:10.858
-(gently) Just not that loud.
-Go ahead.

19:10.941 --> 19:13.861
Well, I am smart,
nice, tolerant, funny

19:13.944 --> 19:16.196
but not "mean funny,"
and I never forget a birthday,

19:16.280 --> 19:17.906
even for kids who move away.

19:17.990 --> 19:19.700
Now, Lisa,
there's only one last thing

19:19.783 --> 19:21.827
you have to do
to be a Little Monster.

19:21.910 --> 19:24.163
I'll do anything but sing.
