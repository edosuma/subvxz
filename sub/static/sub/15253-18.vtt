00:02.719 --> 00:04.854
<i>Is it strange that
all of the new employees</i>

00:04.905 --> 00:07.390
have been named Greta?

00:07.458 --> 00:09.459
Devon, this is one
of my father's laptops.

00:09.526 --> 00:11.661
How did...? He left it for
Ellie. There's something on it,

00:11.729 --> 00:13.863
<i>some memory problem
that Ellie figured out.</i>

00:13.931 --> 00:16.916
<i>What was exactly
going down there in Castle?</i>

00:17.001 --> 00:18.334
Are you leveraging me

00:18.385 --> 00:19.502
to stay in my apartment?

00:19.570 --> 00:20.870
Let's say I was.

00:20.921 --> 00:22.755
You can stay at my place,
long as you keep quiet.

00:22.840 --> 00:24.974
Don't tell anyone,
especially Bartowski.

00:33.984 --> 00:35.985
Hope you didn't
think this interrogation was over,

00:36.053 --> 00:37.253
Mr. Grimes.

00:37.321 --> 00:40.723
We know about your
involvement with the CIA.

00:40.774 --> 00:43.409
I have no idea, no idea
what you're talking about.

00:43.494 --> 00:46.062
We know that you work
with John Casey.

00:46.113 --> 00:49.465
Just admit it; this
can all be over.

00:49.533 --> 00:52.335
I don't know anything,
I don't know.

00:53.437 --> 00:57.206
Okay, okay, hold on a second.

00:57.274 --> 00:58.458
I admit it.

00:58.542 --> 01:00.877
I have worked with John Casey.

01:00.944 --> 01:05.214
We worked together
for the last four years now.

01:05.282 --> 01:06.432
We started in large appliances,

01:06.517 --> 01:08.101
and then I worked
up to Buy More manager.

01:08.185 --> 01:10.119
You think this is funny?

01:10.187 --> 01:13.056
Are you really willing
to sacrifice your life

01:13.123 --> 01:16.359
to protect John Casey?

01:16.426 --> 01:20.096
My only regret is that
I have one life to give.

01:20.147 --> 01:22.331
Go ahead, do your worst.

01:27.071 --> 01:28.004
Okay.

01:28.072 --> 01:29.605
That was tough.

01:29.673 --> 01:31.624
Well, you didn't wet yourself
this time.

01:31.708 --> 01:32.642
That's an improvement.

01:32.709 --> 01:33.776
I didn't drink any water today.

01:33.844 --> 01:35.611
Welcome to the team, soldier.

01:35.662 --> 01:37.146
Thank you, sir.

01:37.214 --> 01:39.749
Glad to be part of it.

01:42.202 --> 01:43.986
Whoa.

01:44.054 --> 01:46.923
So where are you
going... a super secret spy mission?

01:46.990 --> 01:48.324
Don't do that.

01:48.392 --> 01:50.860
I'm just goofing around
with you there, buddy, roomie.

01:50.928 --> 01:52.295
First rule of Team Casey,

01:52.362 --> 01:53.813
right: don't ask, don't tell.

01:53.897 --> 01:55.431
What about Chuck and Sarah?

01:55.482 --> 01:57.400
Especially not Chuck and Sarah.

01:58.485 --> 02:00.436
Sorry.

02:02.106 --> 02:04.040
You really care
about your best friend,

02:04.108 --> 02:06.342
you'll lock it down, Morgan.

02:10.514 --> 02:13.282
Morgan Grimes, you are a badass.

02:15.335 --> 02:16.986
Oh, no, I peed a little bit.

02:17.054 --> 02:19.555
15 seconds.

02:20.624 --> 02:21.791
Ten...

02:21.859 --> 02:23.042
Sarah, stop yelling.

02:23.127 --> 02:24.677
You know I don't work well
under pressure.

02:24.761 --> 02:25.962
Okay?

02:28.632 --> 02:30.199
Gah, no, no,

02:30.267 --> 02:31.567
no.

02:31.635 --> 02:33.703
Damn wishbone.

02:33.770 --> 02:34.904
Your turn.

02:34.972 --> 02:36.355
I can't do this anymore.

02:36.440 --> 02:37.974
I'm sorry, we've been
sitting around for two weeks.

02:38.025 --> 02:39.642
We need a mission, Chuck.

02:39.693 --> 02:41.077
So we hit a dry spell?

02:41.145 --> 02:43.479
Are you ready
for some real excitement?

02:43.530 --> 02:46.616
Final Fantasy II.

02:46.683 --> 02:48.918
Morgan and I spent an entire
summer devouring this one.

02:48.986 --> 02:52.788
What is the point of being a spy
if there aren't any missions?

02:55.492 --> 02:57.493
Ca...

02:57.544 --> 02:58.711
Casey, what are you doing here?

02:58.795 --> 02:59.712
Did Beckman call?

02:59.796 --> 03:02.765
No, I'm just...
returning something.

03:02.833 --> 03:05.234
A.50-cal sniper rifle?

03:05.302 --> 03:06.419
Why are you checking weapons

03:06.503 --> 03:07.670
out of the armory?

03:07.721 --> 03:09.505
I was just plinking
on the range.

03:09.556 --> 03:11.540
Don't want a beautiful weapon
like this to feel neglected.

03:11.592 --> 03:13.226
Well, what about us?
Do you think

03:13.310 --> 03:14.644
Beckman has secretly
sidelined our team?

03:14.711 --> 03:16.712
Yeah, why else would our
missions dry up like this?

03:16.780 --> 03:18.514
I don't know, maybe
the Intersect has made

03:18.565 --> 03:21.100
the world
a more peaceful place.

03:21.185 --> 03:22.118
Hmm.

03:22.186 --> 03:23.385
What is that about?

03:23.437 --> 03:24.387
Well, you think
we're stir-crazy.

03:24.454 --> 03:25.655
Think about how Casey feels.

03:25.722 --> 03:27.957
I mean, he hasn't shot
someone in two weeks.

03:28.025 --> 03:28.958
That we know of.

03:29.026 --> 03:30.059
Casey is up to something

03:30.127 --> 03:32.245
and I am going to get
to the bottom of it.

03:32.329 --> 03:35.698
Sarah... Sarah.

03:58.421 --> 03:59.555
This is so weird.

03:59.606 --> 04:01.691
I didn't know
this hallway even existed.

04:01.758 --> 04:03.309
Maybe it's part of all
that new construction

04:03.393 --> 04:05.094
that's been going on.

04:07.898 --> 04:09.198
Huh.

04:09.266 --> 04:11.334
Well, allow me. It's not like
they're going to deny

04:11.401 --> 04:13.269
the one and only Intersect.

04:16.740 --> 04:19.158
Okay, so maybe you're not
being completely paranoid.

04:19.243 --> 04:22.043
Come to think of it, I
haven't seen much of Casey

04:22.112 --> 04:23.079
in the last couple weeks.

04:23.146 --> 04:25.014
Do you think he's gone
lone wolf on us?

04:25.082 --> 04:26.949
Yeah, that's it, prowling
around the streets at night,

04:27.017 --> 04:27.984
administering
vigilante justice.

04:28.051 --> 04:29.285
I mean, come...

04:29.353 --> 04:31.153
Actually, that's, that's
entirely plausible.

04:31.221 --> 04:32.805
Chuck, I think it's time
for a spy intervention.

04:32.889 --> 04:34.790
We need to put
our partner on the spot.

04:34.858 --> 04:36.809
No.

04:36.893 --> 04:38.294
I have a better idea.

04:38.362 --> 04:40.630
Hey, Chuck, what's up, man?

04:40.697 --> 04:44.000
Hey, buddy, um, you
mind if I come in?

04:44.067 --> 04:45.818
You know what?
I do mind because,

04:45.902 --> 04:48.704
uh, I just waxed my floors.

04:48.772 --> 04:50.990
Really? Cooked that one
up on the spot, did you?

04:51.074 --> 04:53.976
What's your new spy partner
been up to these days?

04:54.044 --> 04:55.811
<i>Oh, you must be referring
to my domestpartner,</i>

04:55.862 --> 04:57.446
for I am not privy

04:57.514 --> 04:59.382
to Casey's spy life.

04:59.449 --> 05:01.083
Well, have you seen
your new roommate

05:01.151 --> 05:02.385
disappearing at odd times?

05:02.452 --> 05:03.452
No.

05:03.503 --> 05:04.520
Coming home with
fresh injuries?

05:04.588 --> 05:05.371
None that I'm aware of.

05:05.455 --> 05:06.389
Receiving solo missions

05:06.456 --> 05:08.874
from one General Diane Beckman?

05:08.959 --> 05:10.026
Can't say that I have, Chief.

05:11.795 --> 05:13.329
One more little question.

05:13.397 --> 05:14.730
Mm-hmm.

05:14.798 --> 05:16.465
Where have all my missions gone?

05:16.533 --> 05:18.801
Because either all the
bad guys are on vacation

05:18.869 --> 05:20.936
or Casey's up to something.

05:22.372 --> 05:23.739
Or

05:23.807 --> 05:25.207
maybe

05:25.275 --> 05:28.644
the Intersect has just made
the world a more peaceful place.

05:31.214 --> 05:32.148
Yeah.

05:34.284 --> 05:36.385
Yeah.

05:36.453 --> 05:38.487
Good seeing you, pal.

05:38.555 --> 05:41.190
I can't believe Morgan would
just lie to my face like that.

05:41.258 --> 05:42.658
I can't believe Casey
would lie to my face...

05:42.709 --> 05:43.659
my old partner.

05:43.710 --> 05:46.162
Wait, didn't Casey say

05:46.213 --> 05:47.880
that Beckman had him working
on something new?

05:47.964 --> 05:49.932
Do you think Beckman is sending
him out on missions without us?

05:50.000 --> 05:51.834
That's crazy talk, Sarah,
why would Beckman do that?

05:51.902 --> 05:53.502
We're Casey's team.

05:53.553 --> 05:55.421
Wait, he's on the move.

05:55.505 --> 05:56.906
Oh, oh,
are we really doing this

05:56.973 --> 05:58.341
right now... I mean,
spying on our own partner?

05:58.408 --> 05:59.342
Isn't that a little icky?

05:59.409 --> 06:00.643
Well, think about it.

06:00.711 --> 06:02.211
If Casey is going out
on missions without us,

06:02.279 --> 06:04.347
then he is doing so
without the Intersect.

06:04.414 --> 06:05.915
You're right.

06:05.982 --> 06:07.350
What if he gets in a jam?

06:07.417 --> 06:08.417
What if he needs our help?

06:08.485 --> 06:10.219
I mean, we're not spying
on Casey.

06:10.287 --> 06:11.787
We're watching his back.

06:11.855 --> 06:13.456
Duh.

06:13.523 --> 06:16.558
♪
♪

06:28.805 --> 06:31.040
It sure was nice of Devon
to let us borrow his new Sienna.

06:31.108 --> 06:33.242
I mean, it is the
perfect tail vehicle.

06:33.310 --> 06:35.010
Think about it...
dual screens, Bluetooth,

06:35.078 --> 06:36.746
ten-speaker sound system,

06:36.813 --> 06:37.747
and it's so comfy.

06:37.814 --> 06:39.014
Yeah, it's unassuming.

06:39.082 --> 06:41.684
That's why it's
the perfect tail vehicle.

06:43.787 --> 06:46.288
Of course, yes,
you're right, focus.

06:46.356 --> 06:49.108
Time to find out what kind
of game Casey's playing.

06:53.697 --> 06:56.365
Easy.

06:56.433 --> 06:58.401
Your boss is expecting me.

06:58.452 --> 07:00.469
I wasn't expecting you,

07:00.537 --> 07:02.438
I was expecting Dragan,

07:02.506 --> 07:05.508
and I wasn't expecting him
for two days.

07:05.575 --> 07:07.126
Slight change of plans.

07:07.210 --> 07:09.145
Wasn't part of our arrangement.

07:09.212 --> 07:11.447
All right.

07:11.515 --> 07:14.984
My employer will be happy
to do business elsewhere.

07:15.051 --> 07:17.353
Please...

07:17.421 --> 07:20.156
excuse my lack

07:20.223 --> 07:22.141
of hospitality.

07:35.839 --> 07:37.606
He's all alone.

07:37.657 --> 07:39.842
What's he trying to do...
get himself killed?

07:39.910 --> 07:42.745
Don't you want to open it?

07:43.847 --> 07:46.682
I would trust Dragan
with my life.

07:48.618 --> 07:52.955
You, on the other hand,
John Casey,

07:53.006 --> 07:55.958
NSA agent,

07:56.026 --> 07:58.360
not so much.

08:00.347 --> 08:02.198
What exactly was your plan...

08:02.265 --> 08:03.899
to just walk in here

08:03.967 --> 08:05.634
and arrest me,

08:05.702 --> 08:08.237
all alone?

08:08.305 --> 08:11.240
He's not alone.

08:11.308 --> 08:13.509
He wouldn't go undercover
without his team.

08:13.560 --> 08:14.710
Yeah,

08:14.778 --> 08:16.846
honestly,
what do you take him for?

08:16.913 --> 08:18.347
What are you doing here?

08:18.415 --> 08:20.149
Saving your life, partner.

08:20.217 --> 08:21.851
I don't need saving, idiot.

08:21.918 --> 08:23.986
Oh, really, I'm the idiot, huh?

08:24.037 --> 08:26.655
Please, let me settle this.

08:29.960 --> 08:34.330
You are all idiots.

08:55.402 --> 08:57.403
You're under arrest.

08:57.487 --> 08:59.522
Good work, Colonel.

09:00.924 --> 09:02.424
Wait, so this was all a sting?

09:04.027 --> 09:05.861
Hang on a second.

09:05.929 --> 09:07.863
Is that Greta...

09:07.931 --> 09:10.566
and the other Greta?

09:11.668 --> 09:14.336
Chuck, Sarah.

09:15.422 --> 09:17.506
Meet my new team.

Look at those two.

10:06.708 --> 10:09.610
First, they take over the Buy
More, then they steal

10:09.677 --> 10:11.645
our partner, and now they're
taking over our spy base.

10:11.677 --> 10:13.628
I just can't believe
Casey replaced us.

10:13.695 --> 10:15.179
I can't believe
the CIA replaced us.

10:15.263 --> 10:16.630
Come again?

10:16.682 --> 10:18.766
Well, who do you think
is taking all of our missions?

10:18.834 --> 10:21.686
Honey, please, look,
I have something irreplaceable

10:21.770 --> 10:23.104
in this little head
of mine, okay?

10:23.155 --> 10:25.439
So let Casey have his new team.

10:25.507 --> 10:27.875
You've still got
the Intersect, baby.

10:27.943 --> 10:29.910
Let's go introduce
ourselves, shall we?

10:31.330 --> 10:33.280
So I said to him,

10:33.332 --> 10:35.149
"You can keep
your larger magazine capacity.

10:35.200 --> 10:36.484
"When it comes
to stopping power,

10:36.551 --> 10:38.319
nothing beats my.45."

10:38.387 --> 10:39.353
That is hilarious.

10:39.421 --> 10:40.855
That hilarious.

10:40.922 --> 10:42.723
.45s.

10:42.791 --> 10:44.825
Great work back there,
by the way,

10:44.893 --> 10:45.993
with the, with the guns

10:46.061 --> 10:47.428
and the bad guys
and the... b-b-boo!

10:47.496 --> 10:48.429
Took 'em all out.

10:48.496 --> 10:49.864
That was impressive.
I'm sorry,

10:49.931 --> 10:52.066
but I never got
your actual names,

10:52.134 --> 10:54.935
and I really don't want
to keep calling you Greta.

10:55.003 --> 10:56.470
I'm assuming GRETA's probably
an acronym for...

10:56.538 --> 10:57.304
Captain Richard Noble.

10:57.372 --> 10:58.272
Captain Victoria Dunwoody.

10:58.340 --> 10:59.440
Captain.

10:59.508 --> 11:00.408
- Captain.
- Agent.

11:00.475 --> 11:02.109
Rick and Vicki.

11:02.177 --> 11:03.511
It's rhymey.
It's cute.

11:03.578 --> 11:04.979
You guys a couple or something?

11:05.030 --> 11:07.114
Don't be ridiculous.
It's against agency protocol.

11:07.182 --> 11:09.150
Romantic entanglements lead
to lapses in judgment.

11:09.217 --> 11:10.217
You ought to know.

11:10.285 --> 11:11.619
Agent Walker?

11:12.854 --> 11:14.455
A word, please.

11:14.523 --> 11:16.490
So, what kind of music
are you guys into?

11:17.459 --> 11:19.393
I see you're very busy.

11:19.461 --> 11:21.212
I see you picked your new team

11:21.296 --> 11:22.496
for their sparkling
personalities.

11:22.564 --> 11:24.215
I'm sorry you had
to find out this way.

11:24.299 --> 11:25.466
Oh, forget it. It's not like

11:25.534 --> 11:27.001
I've been your partner
for the last four years.

11:27.069 --> 11:28.169
Please let me explain.

11:28.236 --> 11:30.037
No, it's cool.
You know, I get it.

11:30.105 --> 11:31.572
You've been busy, Beckman
gave you a new team,

11:31.640 --> 11:32.807
you've been out running
missions with them.

11:32.874 --> 11:35.209
This wasn't Beckman's idea.

11:37.646 --> 11:38.729
Colonel Casey,

11:38.814 --> 11:40.064
grab your team.

11:40.148 --> 11:41.682
Mission briefing in five.

11:41.750 --> 11:46.053
That is, if you're all through
fraternizing with your old team.

11:53.912 --> 11:56.097
So, who is, uh, Susie Sunshine?

11:56.164 --> 11:57.531
Director Bentley.

11:57.599 --> 11:59.700
She's our Beckman...

11:59.768 --> 12:02.286
except not as warm and cuddly.

12:02.370 --> 12:06.807
Well, babe,
I guess it's just you and me.

12:06.875 --> 12:08.008
Where are you going?

12:08.076 --> 12:09.410
To fix this.

12:09.478 --> 12:11.278
Oh, boy.

12:11.346 --> 12:13.748
General, why didn't you tell
us that Casey was heading up

12:13.815 --> 12:15.216
his own team?

12:15.283 --> 12:17.752
Agent Walker, you're not the
only one who has to take orders.

12:17.819 --> 12:19.587
I'm playing the cards
I was dealt.

12:19.654 --> 12:20.821
I suggest you do the same.

12:20.889 --> 12:22.890
Quick follow-up question,
General?

12:22.941 --> 12:25.309
Who's the A-team,
and who's the B-team here?

12:25.393 --> 12:28.262
I know that you love our team
and Casey's team equally...

12:28.330 --> 12:29.563
Enough. Both of you.

12:29.631 --> 12:32.233
Right now you need
to focus on the mission at hand.

12:32.300 --> 12:34.101
Which is?

12:34.169 --> 12:35.770
A top-priority extraction
from Tblisi.

12:35.837 --> 12:37.171
You'll recognize the target

12:37.239 --> 12:38.939
of the Colonel's
recent sting operation,

12:38.990 --> 12:41.709
Necati Acar, AKA The Turk.

12:41.776 --> 12:43.010
Although his arrest
was important,

12:43.078 --> 12:44.779
the real prize

12:44.846 --> 12:46.981
is this man... Dragan Pichushkin.

12:47.048 --> 12:48.749
Arms dealer.

12:48.817 --> 12:52.119
He's made a fortune dismantling
the former Soviet arsenal,

12:52.187 --> 12:53.637
and selling it
on the black market.

12:53.722 --> 12:54.822
The Turk has agreed

12:54.890 --> 12:56.791
to lure Dragan onto U.S. soil

12:56.858 --> 12:58.025
under one condition.

12:58.093 --> 12:59.994
That we offer his family asylum?

13:00.061 --> 13:01.829
Precisely, Agent Walker.

13:01.897 --> 13:04.331
All we have
is a first name... Jana.

13:04.399 --> 13:05.533
Wife?

13:05.600 --> 13:07.001
Jana?

13:07.068 --> 13:08.686
Jana. Mistress.

13:08.770 --> 13:10.538
Think it's probably
a mistress. No photos?

13:10.605 --> 13:12.139
That's why we're sending you.

13:12.207 --> 13:13.874
Wheels up first thing
in the morning.

13:13.942 --> 13:15.876
Use the Intersect to ID Jana,

13:15.944 --> 13:18.445
and return her safely
to U.S. soil.

13:18.513 --> 13:21.482
That is all... team.

13:21.550 --> 13:23.818
I think she meant
to say "A-team."

13:23.885 --> 13:27.037
I can't believe we're
finally going on a mission!

13:33.461 --> 13:35.379
Hey.

13:36.548 --> 13:38.032
Devon, you okay?

13:38.099 --> 13:40.100
Just trying to find
my baseline, bro.

13:40.168 --> 13:41.702
Oh, stressful day at the ER?

13:41.770 --> 13:42.903
Trauma surgery's a cinch.

13:42.971 --> 13:44.405
It's coming home
that's stressful.

13:44.472 --> 13:47.474
Being home with the baby has
made Ellie a little stir crazy.

13:47.542 --> 13:49.476
Must be going around. When
I walk through that door,

13:49.544 --> 13:52.980
she makes up for 12 hours of
not talking to another adult

13:53.048 --> 13:54.181
in about 12 minutes.

13:54.249 --> 13:55.349
Wish me luck.

13:55.417 --> 13:56.984
Good luck.

13:57.052 --> 13:58.853
Hi, honey.
How was work?

13:58.920 --> 14:01.488
I'm so glad you're home.
I've been dying to talk.

14:01.540 --> 14:02.823
Remember how I've been trying

14:02.874 --> 14:04.658
to keep track
of Clara's sleep schedule?

14:04.726 --> 14:06.227
Well, I finally crunched
some numbers.

14:06.294 --> 14:08.229
At first I couldn't
find the Circadian cycle,

14:08.296 --> 14:10.364
but then, I applied
some basic biostatistics.

14:10.415 --> 14:13.834
Voila. Isn't that incredible?
Oh, wait till you see

14:13.902 --> 14:15.769
the data that I gathered
during tummy time.

14:15.837 --> 14:18.038
And here is a chart
of Clara's new vocal sounds.

14:18.106 --> 14:19.874
Trust me, you can
go a little loony

14:19.941 --> 14:21.926
with somebody babbling
in your ear all day long.

14:23.228 --> 14:25.479
The problem is,
I only have one test subject,

14:25.546 --> 14:27.547
so in order
to control my experiment,

14:27.599 --> 14:29.783
we're going to have
to have a second baby.

14:31.052 --> 14:32.219
Joking.

14:32.287 --> 14:34.388
Speaking of computer modeling,

14:34.456 --> 14:36.557
whatever happened
to my dad's laptop?

14:36.625 --> 14:38.459
Devon?

14:38.526 --> 14:40.027
Devon, are you listening to me?

14:40.095 --> 14:41.262
Huh? Yeah. Computers.

14:41.329 --> 14:42.763
Brain science.
Totally with you.

14:42.831 --> 14:44.632
Good, because
I'm starting to think

14:44.699 --> 14:47.234
that my dad left me
that computer for a reason.

14:47.285 --> 14:51.038
Maybe his research is just the
diversion that I need right now.

14:51.106 --> 14:53.240
Devon, I want
that computer back.

14:55.477 --> 14:57.461
<i>I wonder what
Casey's team is up to.</i>

14:57.545 --> 14:58.879
Who cares? Beckman said it

14:58.930 --> 15:00.598
herself... this extraction
is top priority.

15:01.850 --> 15:03.784
It's the bro-in-law.

15:05.353 --> 15:07.121
Hey, Devon.
What's going on, buddy?

15:07.188 --> 15:08.639
Chuck, we need to talk.

15:08.723 --> 15:09.723
Why are you whispering?

15:09.791 --> 15:10.791
'Cause Clara's sleeping.

15:10.859 --> 15:12.459
And I don't want Ellie to hear.

15:12.527 --> 15:14.561
- Can this wait till I'm home?
- Chuck,

15:14.629 --> 15:15.796
Ellie wants your dad's laptop.

15:15.864 --> 15:17.398
She thinks he gave it
to her for a reason.

15:17.449 --> 15:20.534
No. Devon, listen to me,
and listen to me very carefully.

15:20.602 --> 15:22.569
She cannot have the laptop.

15:22.637 --> 15:25.172
The laptop is filled with all
kinds of dangerous spy stuff,

15:25.240 --> 15:26.573
which is probably why

15:26.641 --> 15:28.342
it's buried
deep beneath Langley right now.

15:28.410 --> 15:30.077
That's great, but she gave
the computer to me.

15:30.128 --> 15:31.412
What am I supposed to tell her?

15:31.479 --> 15:33.213
I don't know. Tell her
you lost it. Better yet...

15:33.281 --> 15:35.165
Better yet, tell her
you brought it to the Buy More

15:35.250 --> 15:36.350
to get it fixed.

15:36.418 --> 15:37.851
She'll assume
Jeff and Lester lost it.

15:37.919 --> 15:39.003
Good cover story, bro.

15:39.087 --> 15:40.754
Hey, that's why
you called a pro, huh?

15:50.231 --> 15:52.433
Wait.

15:52.500 --> 15:55.035
I'm seeing a... square?

15:55.103 --> 15:57.471
Close. Squiggly lines.

15:57.522 --> 15:59.523
Excuse me?

15:59.607 --> 16:01.075
Damn it, lady!

16:01.142 --> 16:03.444
Can't you see that you're
ruining his concentration?

16:03.511 --> 16:04.912
Listen, I'm just here
to get my computer,

16:04.980 --> 16:06.980
and then you two can go back
to your little game.

16:07.032 --> 16:09.983
Game? I will have you know,
Eleanor,

16:10.035 --> 16:12.586
that our friend Jeffrey here
is a clairvoyant.

16:14.189 --> 16:16.490
Read her thoughts, Jeffrey.

16:18.593 --> 16:20.561
She hates us.

16:20.628 --> 16:22.596
She thinks we're pathetic.

16:22.664 --> 16:24.531
She doesn't believe in ESP.

16:24.599 --> 16:26.133
That's really good.

16:26.201 --> 16:28.002
Can I have my computer?

16:28.069 --> 16:29.887
Fine. Where's your claim stub?

16:29.971 --> 16:31.021
I don't know.
Devon dropped it off.

16:31.106 --> 16:32.856
No claim stub,
no computer. Mush!

16:35.110 --> 16:38.012
Okay, uh, you guys just...

16:38.079 --> 16:39.980
You don't understand.
There's-There's something

16:40.048 --> 16:42.483
really important
on that laptop.

16:42.534 --> 16:45.652
Something... private.

16:46.738 --> 16:48.922
Go on.

16:48.990 --> 16:52.226
Devon and I... we made a video

16:52.293 --> 16:54.228
when we were in med school.

16:54.295 --> 16:57.865
Um, I'd just hate for it
to fall into the wrong hands.

16:57.932 --> 17:01.418
Jeffrey, clear our schedule.

17:01.503 --> 17:04.171
Ma'am, we're gonna find

17:04.239 --> 17:06.406
that laptop
if it's the last thing we do.

17:09.810 --> 17:11.145
Ugh.

17:15.916 --> 17:18.234
Looks like Jana's
running a little late.

17:18.319 --> 17:22.289
Or else The Turk's enemies
got to her before we did.

17:24.576 --> 17:27.027
Looks like this landing zone
is about to get a little hot.

17:29.781 --> 17:32.066
That's why Beckman sent us.

17:41.760 --> 17:44.211
Do any of those guys look
like a Jana to you?

17:44.279 --> 17:46.964
You wanted Jana?
I'm getting her.

17:47.048 --> 17:49.316
These charmers stuffed
her in the trunk.

17:49.384 --> 17:51.151
I don't like this, Sarah.

17:55.023 --> 17:57.791
Oh, my God, they chopped her up
into little pieces.

18:09.871 --> 18:10.871
What?

18:14.409 --> 18:17.327
Sarah, meet Jana.

18:18.713 --> 18:20.080
This was our big extraction?

18:20.131 --> 18:21.832
A stupid dog?!

18:21.916 --> 18:24.134
Sometimes boss's dog
gets upset tummy.

18:24.219 --> 18:27.321
Try mixing in a cup of her
dry food with the wet stuff.

18:27.388 --> 18:31.458
And be sure to
walk her every hour, or...

18:31.526 --> 18:33.126
that happens.

18:33.178 --> 18:34.528
Oh!

18:34.596 --> 18:37.631
Oh, gross.

18:37.699 --> 18:39.333
Oh, my God, Sarah.

18:41.069 --> 18:43.770
We're the B-team.

18:51.421 --> 18:52.936
We used to be
the A-team, Sarah,

18:52.937 --> 18:53.729
the sharp end of the CIA stick.

18:53.730 --> 18:55.006
And now we're glorified
pet couriers?

18:55.091 --> 18:56.624
Nothing has changed,
Chuck. Oh, is that right?

18:56.676 --> 18:58.760
Well, okay, what do you call
Casey's new team then?

18:58.811 --> 19:00.061
I call them the competition.

19:00.129 --> 19:01.696
You want to be on
the A-team again,

19:01.764 --> 19:02.998
we're gonna have to earn it.

19:03.065 --> 19:04.849
What? How?

19:04.934 --> 19:07.168
Dragan. Beckman said
he's the brass ring.

19:07.236 --> 19:08.770
We're gonna collar him,

19:08.838 --> 19:11.273
and we're gonna show the
General that we've still got it.

19:11.324 --> 19:13.875
Except that the only person
who can lead us to Dragan is

19:13.943 --> 19:15.910
The Turk, and who knows
where they're keeping him.

19:20.416 --> 19:21.499
Is that...?

19:21.584 --> 19:22.984
Jana?

19:25.154 --> 19:27.322
I bet she's got an upset tummy.

19:27.390 --> 19:29.991
Do you think they remembered
to mix in the dry food?

19:30.042 --> 19:31.126
Chuck, if The Turk's dog

19:31.193 --> 19:32.594
is behind that door,
so is The Turk.

19:32.662 --> 19:34.696
All we got to do is get through
four inches of solid steel.

19:34.764 --> 19:37.966
Or we chop off Casey's hand.

19:38.034 --> 19:40.335
Let's keep that as our
backup plan, shall we?

19:40.403 --> 19:41.603
Sure.

19:41.671 --> 19:43.305
Okay.

19:46.475 --> 19:48.710
Morgan, I can hear you
eating potato chips.

19:48.778 --> 19:50.278
All right? Open the door.

19:50.346 --> 19:52.347
Can't do that, Chuck.
This is ridiculous.

19:52.398 --> 19:53.915
Why can't we talk face-to-face?

19:53.983 --> 19:55.450
Just trust me, okay?
It's for your own good.

19:55.518 --> 19:56.685
Oh, is that right?

19:56.752 --> 19:58.787
Or is that what Casey told you
to tell me?

19:58.854 --> 20:00.789
Hey, hey,
the Colonel's a good man,

20:00.856 --> 20:02.724
and he gave me my orders, okay?

20:02.792 --> 20:04.075
To lock it down.

20:04.160 --> 20:05.126
Let me in!

20:05.194 --> 20:06.895
Over my dead body, Chuck.

20:10.966 --> 20:13.034
How about
over your tranq'd body?

20:14.603 --> 20:17.005
You were distracting me
so she could break in.

20:17.073 --> 20:18.239
Yeah.

20:18.307 --> 20:19.974
Clever girl.

20:20.042 --> 20:21.343
Are you using
the five-milligram darts?

20:21.410 --> 20:22.544
Ten.

20:22.611 --> 20:24.746
Please tell Casey
I put up a good fight.

20:25.614 --> 20:27.282
Great. Now all we need

20:27.350 --> 20:29.884
is something with Casey's
handprint on it so we can

20:29.935 --> 20:32.570
access the secret
part of Castle.

20:32.655 --> 20:33.988
Ooh. What are these?

20:34.056 --> 20:36.224
These have a camera
inside of them

20:36.275 --> 20:37.575
that'll scan for any bioresidue.

20:37.660 --> 20:39.594
Ugh! Sounds like a CBS show.

20:44.033 --> 20:45.417
I found one, but

20:45.501 --> 20:47.502
this handprint is way too tiny.

20:47.570 --> 20:49.454
Looks like it belongs
to a child.

20:50.873 --> 20:52.340
Oh, right.

20:52.408 --> 20:54.292
Bingo.

20:55.845 --> 20:57.212
Sarah.

21:10.726 --> 21:13.311
Not bad for the B-team.

21:21.704 --> 21:24.622
Holy crap! Their Castle is

21:24.707 --> 21:26.174
so much cooler than ours.

21:26.242 --> 21:28.343
I wonder if they have that

21:28.411 --> 21:29.978
fancy Greek yogurt
in their kitchen.

21:31.881 --> 21:33.281
Okay, you go find The Turk.

21:33.332 --> 21:37.302
I'm gonna see if I can pull up
Dragan's case file.

21:48.197 --> 21:50.815
Please, I told you
everything I know

21:50.900 --> 21:54.102
about Dragan's shipments. No, no, no,
no, relax. I'm not part of their team.

21:54.170 --> 21:56.838
They are like a pair
of evil robots.

21:57.907 --> 22:00.275
Wait. They told me about you.

22:00.342 --> 22:02.777
You're the dog-walker, no?

22:02.845 --> 22:05.013
I'm happy you're here.

22:05.080 --> 22:06.781
Jana was beginning
to walk funny.

22:06.849 --> 22:10.118
She needs to have, uh,
how you say, a pee-pee time.

22:22.014 --> 22:23.548
Chuck.

22:23.632 --> 22:26.334
Chuck, I think you
should look at this.

22:29.638 --> 22:30.738
Hey.

22:30.806 --> 22:32.023
What's up?
What do you want me...?

22:38.614 --> 22:41.082
My dad's computer.

22:41.150 --> 22:43.585
Why would they...?

22:43.652 --> 22:46.154
Oh, my God, Casey, please
tell me you didn't.

22:46.222 --> 22:49.040
I think it's
time for us to go, right now.

22:49.124 --> 22:52.327
You're not authorized to be
in this section of Castle.

22:52.378 --> 22:53.862
What are you two doing
with my father's computer?

22:53.929 --> 22:56.998
Sorry, Bartowski, the Intersect
project is classified.

22:57.066 --> 22:58.666
Classifi... Classified?!

22:58.734 --> 23:00.935
I'm not authorized
to be down here?

23:01.003 --> 23:03.421
I am the Intersect.

23:03.506 --> 23:06.007
You're not as special
as you think.

23:06.058 --> 23:08.877
I think you should get out
of here, before you get hurt.

23:27.329 --> 23:28.630
I see you know kung fu.

23:28.697 --> 23:30.281
That's very impressive,

23:30.366 --> 23:31.733
but a little showy
for my taste.

23:31.800 --> 23:33.585
How about this style, Bartowski?

23:33.669 --> 23:35.336
Oh, for heaven's sake.

23:52.521 --> 23:54.255
Chuck, what is happening?

23:54.306 --> 23:57.025
We're following
the same program.

23:58.727 --> 24:02.463
Sarah, they're Intersects.

24:03.566 --> 24:04.866
Stand down, Captain.

24:06.902 --> 24:09.137
So this was your idea,
Casey, huh?

24:09.204 --> 24:12.574
Use my father's program
to make your own Intersects?

24:12.641 --> 24:14.943
Well, now that you have your dream
team, I guess you don't need me

24:15.010 --> 24:16.744
around anymore.
But that right there...

24:16.812 --> 24:18.546
that's mine and I'm taking it.

24:18.614 --> 24:20.331
You don't want to
do that, Bartowski.

24:20.416 --> 24:22.850
Yeah? Well, my father
never wanted his invention

24:22.918 --> 24:24.836
to be used like this. Drop it.

24:24.920 --> 24:27.922
That computer is property
of the U.S. government.

24:28.757 --> 24:29.974
Call off your dogs, Casey.

24:30.059 --> 24:32.660
Captain, put the gun down. Now.

24:32.728 --> 24:35.363
First you put the computer
down, Bartowski.

24:35.431 --> 24:39.000
Or I'll put a bullet in that
obsolete brain of yours.

24:40.152 --> 24:41.202
That's enough.

24:41.270 --> 24:45.657
I'd do as she says,
Mr. Bartowski.

24:45.741 --> 24:47.542
Unlike you,

24:47.610 --> 24:50.545
my Intersects aren't
afraid to pull the trigger.

25:03.107 --> 25:06.180
Now do you understand why
I had Beckman send you to the ***?

25:06.357 --> 25:07.644
Yeah, you wanted us
out of the way.

25:07.645 --> 25:08.644
The CIA's two Intersect teams

25:09.227 --> 25:12.629
were never supposed
to, well, intersect.

25:12.697 --> 25:14.831
It was important that
you not interfere

25:14.899 --> 25:16.233
with the GRETA field tests.

25:16.301 --> 25:19.202
Right. The GRETA's
in the Buy More.

25:19.270 --> 25:21.805
We've been using your store
as a proving ground

25:21.873 --> 25:23.940
for prospective
Intersect candidates.

25:24.008 --> 25:25.242
These two are the best
of the best.

25:25.310 --> 25:28.378
Oh, really? Uh, so then what
does that make me?

25:28.446 --> 25:30.514
None of this would be possible
without you, Chuck.

25:30.581 --> 25:34.017
That's right. We've
been studying you, as well.

25:34.085 --> 25:35.252
Correcting your father's
software

25:35.319 --> 25:37.487
for your various limitations.

25:37.555 --> 25:38.872
What limitations?

25:38.956 --> 25:40.324
His emotional sensitivity.

25:40.391 --> 25:41.858
His over-reliance
on his handlers.

25:41.926 --> 25:44.394
His inability
to terminate targets.

25:44.462 --> 25:46.596
You clearly fixed that glitch.
Vicki here almost shot Chuck.

25:48.166 --> 25:50.600
If you'll excuse us,
we have a mission to complete.

25:53.855 --> 25:55.672
Dragan Pichushkin,
our primary target,

25:55.723 --> 25:57.140
is currently en route

25:57.208 --> 25:59.476
to an airfield outside
of Los Angeles.

25:59.527 --> 26:03.030
Our analysts at Langley believe that
he is on this aircraft, which was...

26:07.085 --> 26:11.038
...hijacked by
drug runners in 2006.

26:11.122 --> 26:14.324
The plane is now registered
to a Moscow shell corporation.

26:14.375 --> 26:16.460
Yeah, what they said.

26:16.527 --> 26:17.694
Very good.

26:17.762 --> 26:19.830
Colonel, your team will
intercept Pichushkin,

26:19.897 --> 26:22.899
confiscate all cargo and
return him alive. Ma'am.

26:22.967 --> 26:23.967
Dismissed.

26:26.971 --> 26:29.005
Oh, and you two are free
to return home

26:29.073 --> 26:30.173
and await further orders.

26:30.241 --> 26:32.476
Unbelievable.

26:36.380 --> 26:39.349
Walker, Walker, let me explain.

26:39.400 --> 26:40.650
Don't, Casey.
Okay, I get why you left.

26:40.718 --> 26:41.952
Because if you'd stayed
with Chuck and I

26:42.019 --> 26:44.020
you would have been
mothballed, as well.

26:44.072 --> 26:47.074
I didn't jump ship. Yeah, well, you didn't
exactly go down with the ship, did you?

26:47.158 --> 26:48.892
I left because you and
Bartowski don't need me anymore.

26:48.960 --> 26:51.728
What? Don't pretend like you
don't know what I'm talking about.

26:51.796 --> 26:53.930
We were a team, Casey.

26:53.998 --> 26:56.600
No, no, you and Bartowski
were the team.

26:56.667 --> 26:59.202
I was just the backup.
That is not true.

27:00.371 --> 27:02.139
Doesn't matter anyway.

27:02.206 --> 27:04.274
I just want you to know,
I think Bentley's

27:04.342 --> 27:06.410
giving you the short
end of the stick.

27:06.477 --> 27:09.346
You and Bartowski...
you're still good agents.

27:09.414 --> 27:12.265
Yeah, well, we used
to be the best.

27:13.951 --> 27:15.786
I'm calling about the laptop.

27:15.853 --> 27:17.253
Did you find it?

27:17.305 --> 27:19.139
Well, there is a chance

27:19.223 --> 27:21.475
that we returned the laptop
to the wrong person.

27:21.559 --> 27:23.660
Gee, what a surprise.

27:23.728 --> 27:25.612
Don't worry. I've got
my best man on it.

27:28.199 --> 27:30.567
I need you to focus
your powers, Jeffrey.

27:30.635 --> 27:32.369
I need a name.

27:32.437 --> 27:34.171
I need you to tell me

27:34.238 --> 27:36.907
who has that missing computer.

27:37.909 --> 27:39.960
So...

27:40.044 --> 27:41.277
You...

27:41.329 --> 27:43.480
are going to close your eyes

27:43.548 --> 27:47.584
and you're going to jot down
whatever letters pop into your head.

27:47.635 --> 27:49.119
Go.

27:50.421 --> 27:52.923
No, that's not a letter.

27:54.642 --> 27:55.759
Deeper.

27:56.844 --> 27:59.062
Jeffrey. Dig! Dig!

28:07.655 --> 28:09.206
What just happened?

28:09.273 --> 28:10.841
Did I do it?

28:17.915 --> 28:19.783
"Cia"?

28:20.918 --> 28:24.004
What the hell kind
of name is Cia?

28:24.088 --> 28:26.756
Totally worthless, Jeffrey.

28:28.342 --> 28:30.227
Take a look at this.

28:30.294 --> 28:32.028
12 hours ago...

28:32.096 --> 28:33.630
target leaving for the States.

28:33.681 --> 28:36.500
I'm confident that your
new team can handle a few bodyguards.

28:36.567 --> 28:39.436
Not them, that.

28:44.809 --> 28:46.026
He's not moving parts.

28:46.110 --> 28:49.379
Pichushkin's moving
a fully-assembled bomb.

28:49.447 --> 28:51.181
We can assume he's
going to use it.

28:51.249 --> 28:52.682
Director, we need backup.

28:52.733 --> 28:54.651
You have two GRETA's.
What else do you need?

28:54.719 --> 28:56.887
My old team, Chuck and Sarah.

28:56.954 --> 28:58.154
It's a five-man job.

28:58.222 --> 29:00.924
You sure you're not just
being sentimental?

29:00.992 --> 29:04.427
Pichushkin's delivering live
explosives to a metropolitan center.

29:04.495 --> 29:06.997
Thanks to the Intersect, we're
equipped with live ordnance disposal.

29:07.064 --> 29:09.332
No, the colonel is right.

29:09.400 --> 29:13.703
This is a perfect job
for Chuck Bartowski.

29:16.641 --> 29:18.391
Bomb disposal?

29:18.476 --> 29:19.776
I mean, seriously?

29:19.844 --> 29:21.711
Don't they have robots
for stuff like this?

29:21.762 --> 29:23.914
It's the only way Bentley would
let you come on the mission.

29:23.981 --> 29:27.017
- I guess expendability has its perks.
- Okay, team,

29:27.084 --> 29:28.451
target lands in inside ten.

29:28.519 --> 29:31.087
You two, help me neutralize
Dragan's security team,

29:31.155 --> 29:33.156
and take him
into custody. Alive.

29:36.193 --> 29:39.195
You're a vital part of this
mission, Chuck. Don't forget it.

29:42.033 --> 29:43.900
And try not to drop
the bomb, Chuck.

29:50.551 --> 29:53.047
Once we have the bomb, ***

29:53.050 --> 29:54.084
Use the Intersect to defuse it.

29:54.152 --> 29:55.702
I know you're
a little scared, Chuck,

29:55.787 --> 29:57.187
but the suit will protect you.

29:57.255 --> 30:00.073
<i>I saw The Hurt Locker,
Casey, okay?</i>

30:00.158 --> 30:01.525
I know what happened
to Guy Pearce.

30:01.592 --> 30:02.859
His suit didn't really do him

30:02.927 --> 30:04.360
a lot of good.

30:04.412 --> 30:06.663
I'm sorry. I'm being
overly sensitive, aren't I?

30:06.714 --> 30:07.998
I bet your new Intersects,

30:08.065 --> 30:09.599
wow, they wouldn't
complain, would they?

30:09.667 --> 30:12.169
I had to wear one of these
in Bosnia.

30:12.236 --> 30:14.004
One of my worst missions.

30:16.007 --> 30:17.741
Here, let me show you
a little trick.

30:17.809 --> 30:20.760
This way, you don't have
to use your hands to drink.

30:22.280 --> 30:23.547
Thanks, buddy.

30:23.614 --> 30:26.383
Good luck, Chuck.

30:26.450 --> 30:27.901
It's your favorite...
apple juice.

30:40.081 --> 30:42.032
♪
♪

30:59.467 --> 31:01.785
Oh, oh, Sarah, they
are outnumbered and outgunned.

31:01.853 --> 31:04.754
Those guards are carrying
automatic weapons.

31:23.574 --> 31:25.508
Oh! Holy crap!
Those two are like Terminators.

31:25.576 --> 31:28.144
They just took out five guys
in the blink of an eye.

31:33.417 --> 31:34.551
Welcome to America,
Mr. Pichushkin.

31:37.521 --> 31:39.256
Let me take your luggage.

31:39.323 --> 31:40.957
It's yours.

31:52.003 --> 31:56.172
Portable fission device.
Five-kiloton yield.

31:56.240 --> 31:58.141
Approximate fire ball radius...
two kilometers.

31:58.209 --> 32:00.210
That's a suitcase nuke.

32:00.278 --> 32:01.978
It's a... I'm sorry.

32:02.046 --> 32:03.613
Did Casey just say...?

32:03.681 --> 32:05.115
So you have your bomb.

32:07.218 --> 32:08.618
But I have detonator.

32:08.686 --> 32:11.121
So I think it's better

32:11.188 --> 32:12.522
<i>if we just part ways, Da?</i>

32:12.590 --> 32:14.958
Casey, let him go.

32:15.009 --> 32:16.543
I've got my eyes on Dragan.

32:18.012 --> 32:19.162
Sar...

32:19.230 --> 32:20.196
Help Walker.

32:20.264 --> 32:22.098
You stay with the bomb.

32:24.835 --> 32:27.270
You need to disarm this now.

32:27.338 --> 32:30.540
This bomb is a Frankenstein with
a hundred different components.

32:30.608 --> 32:31.942
There's nothing in the Intersect

32:32.009 --> 32:34.044
about how to defuse this.

32:34.111 --> 32:35.946
- I can help with this!
- Casey? Hold on.

32:36.013 --> 32:38.815
I'm coming, Casey! I'm coming!

32:38.866 --> 32:40.583
I'm coming. I'm coming.

32:50.878 --> 32:52.662
Show me your hands!

32:54.732 --> 32:55.665
Where's the detonator?

33:00.037 --> 33:01.638
<i>I am detonator.</i>

33:03.207 --> 33:04.307
Very simple.

33:04.375 --> 33:06.576
My heart stop, bomb start.

33:06.644 --> 33:08.979
So you have choice:
you can shoot me,

33:09.046 --> 33:11.264
and hundreds of
thousands of people

33:11.349 --> 33:12.816
will die in nuclear blast.

33:15.987 --> 33:17.120
Or I kill you.

33:19.423 --> 33:20.557
Not easy choice.

33:23.494 --> 33:24.661
Vicki, no, don't shoot!

33:30.901 --> 33:32.035
What did you do?!

33:39.243 --> 33:41.744
What the hell just happened?

33:41.796 --> 33:43.913
Your trigger-happy new partner
just armed the bomb.

33:52.790 --> 33:56.526
Ooh! Portable fission device,
five-kiloton yield.

33:56.594 --> 33:58.895
Yeah, we covered that.
Sir, our best chance is to fly

33:58.963 --> 34:00.263
as far away from civilization
as possible.

34:00.331 --> 34:03.066
What?! We're in
the middle of LA County!

34:03.134 --> 34:05.118
It's a difference between
100,000 casualties

34:05.202 --> 34:07.603
and a million.
We gotta move this bomb now.

34:07.655 --> 34:09.906
No, no. Casey, no,
that's not an option.

34:09.974 --> 34:11.274
We have to disarm it.

34:11.324 --> 34:12.792
You've got the same
computer I've got.

34:12.877 --> 34:13.775
It can't be disarmed.

34:13.828 --> 34:16.413
I can do this, Casey.

34:18.581 --> 34:21.684
Bomb's all yours, Bartowski.

34:21.752 --> 34:23.753
You can't be ser...
Move.

34:28.692 --> 34:29.893
Okay.

34:31.594 --> 34:32.996
Just like old times, huh?

34:33.063 --> 34:34.998
Just tell me there's a plan.
There's a plan, right?

34:35.065 --> 34:36.099
Yeah, yeah, there's a plan.

34:36.167 --> 34:37.801
Okay, Casey, first of all,

34:37.868 --> 34:41.905
I need you to pull out
the primary device.

34:43.873 --> 34:45.641
Slowly, carefully.

34:45.708 --> 34:48.645
We're gonna have to improvise
our way through this one.

34:48.712 --> 34:50.313
Improvi...?!
It's a nuclear bomb.

34:50.380 --> 34:52.114
Stow it, Captain.

34:52.183 --> 34:53.699
Okay, now, Sarah,
that hockey puck-looking

34:53.784 --> 34:55.485
thing on the end there?
That's the detonator.

34:55.553 --> 34:57.003
I need you to twist

34:57.088 --> 35:00.423
and pull... gently.

35:10.101 --> 35:11.968
Okay, the detonator is from

35:12.036 --> 35:13.403
a next-gen Chinese sub,

35:13.471 --> 35:16.106
which means the firing mechanism
had to have been modified

35:16.173 --> 35:21.177
to allow the warhead's
deployment in saltwater.

35:22.246 --> 35:23.646
Saltwater!

35:23.714 --> 35:25.848
Saltwater! Yes!
These detonators,

35:25.900 --> 35:27.517
they automatically deactivate in
saltwater

35:27.585 --> 35:29.986
in the event of a hull breach.

35:30.054 --> 35:31.154
We're nowhere near the ocean.

35:32.156 --> 35:33.890
Ooh...

35:33.958 --> 35:35.525
Saltwater, saltwater,
saltwater...

35:35.593 --> 35:37.794
Mmm, what has...?

35:39.396 --> 35:40.497
What is he doing?

35:40.548 --> 35:42.565
Casey... my juice box.

35:46.303 --> 35:49.389
Please have sodium, please have
sodium, please have sodium.

35:49.473 --> 35:51.141
Yeah, it does! Yes, yes, yes.

35:58.949 --> 36:01.985
Chuck, are you about to disarm a
nuclear bomb using fruit juice?

36:03.087 --> 36:04.487
Okay, do it.

36:12.630 --> 36:15.131
I can't believe that worked.

36:23.924 --> 36:25.542
Love you.

36:25.593 --> 36:26.459
I love you, too.

36:30.464 --> 36:32.749
Try not to drop the bomb, Rick.

36:35.386 --> 36:37.220
Whoa!

36:41.719 --> 36:45.283
Looks like things have
gotten a little crowded in castle.

36:45.295 --> 36:47.363
As I told you before,
this operation

36:47.431 --> 36:48.631
requires only one team.

36:48.698 --> 36:52.034
I concur. I've read Colonel
Casey's report.

36:52.102 --> 36:54.703
In addition to threatening Agent
Bartowski's life,

36:54.771 --> 36:56.705
your team managed to kill
the man

36:56.773 --> 36:58.240
you were supposed to capture

36:58.308 --> 37:02.044
and accidentally arm
a nuclear bomb.

37:02.112 --> 37:04.246
General, I take full
responsibility for my team.

37:04.314 --> 37:05.714
The truth is, Director Bentley,

37:05.782 --> 37:08.217
you should never have pursued
the Intersect field trial

37:08.285 --> 37:11.220
without consulting
the original Intersect.

37:11.288 --> 37:14.590
Agent Bartowski, that is why
you will oversee

37:14.658 --> 37:17.059
all aspects of the Intersect
project from here on out.

37:17.127 --> 37:19.128
And what about my GRETAs?

37:30.039 --> 37:33.109
Intersect extraction complete.

37:37.347 --> 37:39.181
So, how's it feel?

37:39.249 --> 37:42.384
What a relief to have
that outta my head.

37:42.452 --> 37:44.186
That poor bastard Bartowski.

37:44.254 --> 37:46.021
Looks like that's it
for the team.

37:46.089 --> 37:49.625
Honor serving with you, sir.

37:49.693 --> 37:51.827
Captain, Captain, good luck.

38:01.905 --> 38:04.256
Where do you think you're going?

38:05.625 --> 38:07.576
I figured I was through here,

38:07.644 --> 38:09.111
since I don't have a team.

38:09.179 --> 38:11.096
I never dismissed you, Colonel.

38:11.181 --> 38:13.132
Beckman's wrong.

38:13.216 --> 38:15.100
The problem's not
with my GRETAs...

38:15.185 --> 38:16.418
it's this computer.

38:16.470 --> 38:18.420
And you're going
to help me fix it.

38:18.488 --> 38:20.756
Our best engineers couldn't
crack Intersect code.

38:20.824 --> 38:22.224
That's because it wasn't meant
for them.

38:22.292 --> 38:25.461
I need someone who thinks
like a Bartowski.

38:25.529 --> 38:26.695
What are you getting at?

38:32.536 --> 38:36.138
<i>Prepare yourself
for Final Fantasy deux.</i>

38:39.476 --> 38:41.877
Oh, please let that be Beckman.

38:41.945 --> 38:43.579
Oh, come on.

38:43.647 --> 38:44.780
A new mission already?

38:44.848 --> 38:46.448
Beckman wants us to leave ASAP.

38:46.516 --> 38:48.918
She's gonna brief us
in the air.

38:48.969 --> 38:52.154
What? Aren't you curious
as to where we're going?

38:52.222 --> 38:53.956
Well, I'm sure it's someplace
far-off, exciting and dangerous.

38:54.024 --> 38:55.491
And what makes you so sure?

38:55.559 --> 38:57.676
Chuck, we're the A-team.

38:57.761 --> 38:59.862
Valid point.

38:59.930 --> 39:02.598
Well, might as well bring this.

39:02.649 --> 39:04.733
It's gonna be a long flight.

39:04.801 --> 39:08.971
I'm sure we can find something
else to pass the time.

39:09.022 --> 39:11.139
♪
♪

39:14.444 --> 39:17.162
Oh. Mmm.

39:19.749 --> 39:22.451
Not to be crude, but you were
talking about sex, right?

39:26.923 --> 39:29.091
Okay, Devon, "go" time.

39:36.766 --> 39:39.051
Babe, you okay?

39:39.135 --> 39:42.104
It's nothing. I went to the Buy
More to get my dad's laptop,

39:42.172 --> 39:43.973
and of course,
they couldn't find it.

39:44.040 --> 39:45.357
It's my fault.

39:45.442 --> 39:48.377
I should have never trusted
those jackasses.

39:48.445 --> 39:50.846
No, it's my fault.

39:50.914 --> 39:54.316
I shouldn't have pretended
to be something that I'm not.

39:54.384 --> 39:56.385
I guess I just thought
that there might be something

39:56.453 --> 39:58.587
on my dad's computer
that would...

39:58.655 --> 40:00.589
I don't know, change the fact

40:00.657 --> 40:03.125
that I'm just
a stay-at-home mom.

40:03.192 --> 40:05.060
Whoa, whoa, stop right there.

40:05.128 --> 40:11.233
You're Eleanor Bartowski
Woodcomb, PhD, M.D.,

40:11.301 --> 40:13.402
the brainiest, sexiest,

40:13.470 --> 40:15.371
kick-assiest woman
I have ever known.

40:17.173 --> 40:18.941
You're not "just" anything.

40:19.009 --> 40:19.942
Really?

40:20.010 --> 40:21.977
You're Mrs. Awesome.

40:40.046 --> 40:41.496
What happened to you?

40:41.548 --> 40:44.800
I've been in a drug-induced
stupor for the last 24 hours.

40:44.851 --> 40:46.669
What'd I tell you about letting
Jeff buy you

40:46.736 --> 40:47.853
drinks at Chili's?

40:47.937 --> 40:50.172
No, sir, listen,
Chuck and Sarah tranq'd me.

40:50.240 --> 40:52.508
They breached our apartment.

40:52.575 --> 40:55.144
I blew it, and I'm
so sorry, sir.

40:55.195 --> 40:57.713
So, I'm turning in my wings.

41:00.066 --> 41:02.568
One, you're not an aviator,

41:02.652 --> 41:04.519
two, these wings are plastic.

41:04.571 --> 41:07.122
Yeah, I told the Southwest pilot
they were for my nephew.

41:07.190 --> 41:08.290
Look, that's not the point.

41:08.358 --> 41:10.075
The fact remains,
I let you down, sir.

41:10.160 --> 41:11.694
And I'm sorry,

41:11.761 --> 41:13.829
I can't lie to Chuck anymore.

41:13.897 --> 41:15.064
You don't have to.

41:15.131 --> 41:16.632
From here on out,
we're on the same team.

41:16.700 --> 41:19.568
Oh, yes! What a relief!

41:19.619 --> 41:21.620
Gotcha.
Okay...

41:21.705 --> 41:23.622
All right, that's enough.

41:25.241 --> 41:26.925
Can I have my wings back?

41:35.918 --> 41:36.752
Mrs. Woodcomb?

41:36.820 --> 41:37.753
Yes?

41:37.821 --> 41:40.389
Hi. I believe that I have

41:40.440 --> 41:41.724
something of yours.

41:45.028 --> 41:48.030
This is my dad's computer.
Where did you find this?

41:48.098 --> 41:50.799
The Nerd Herd gave me
the wrong computer.

41:50.867 --> 41:52.434
I found your address
in the bag.

41:52.485 --> 41:56.004
Thank you. You have no idea
how much this means to me.

41:58.208 --> 42:00.042
Hi. You're home early.

42:00.110 --> 42:01.543
Babe, it's dinnertime.

42:01.611 --> 42:03.212
What?

42:03.279 --> 42:05.614
Oh, wow, Clara's taking
a monster nap.

42:05.682 --> 42:08.183
I must have lost myself.

42:08.251 --> 42:09.284
Is that...?

42:09.352 --> 42:10.386
Yeah. Great news.

42:10.453 --> 42:13.889
I found my dad's computer.
