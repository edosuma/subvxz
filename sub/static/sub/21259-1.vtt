WEBVTT

00:04.038 --> 00:06.140
- Carpe diem,
let's party!

00:06.474 --> 00:07.541
Yes!

00:08.276 --> 00:09.043
Voiceover:
Last season on

00:09.077 --> 00:09.610
"Odd Mom Out."

00:09.643 --> 00:10.578
- You shot the doormen.

00:10.611 --> 00:12.313
I'm gonna do a group show.

00:12.346 --> 00:14.082
I'd love to include you.

00:14.115 --> 00:15.083
- I wish you would stay.

00:15.116 --> 00:16.084
- Is this a test?

00:16.117 --> 00:18.519
- No, I just wanted
you to know how I feel.

00:18.552 --> 00:19.520
- So you met
Mr. Ernie Krevitt,

00:19.553 --> 00:21.122
genius investor.

00:21.155 --> 00:21.989
- What's going on?

00:22.022 --> 00:23.224
- They're saying he
pulled a Madoff.

00:23.257 --> 00:24.058
[gasps]

00:24.092 --> 00:25.126
- Brooke just got
me in with him.

00:25.159 --> 00:26.327
- Sebastian!

00:26.360 --> 00:27.528
- Of course I
went all in.

00:27.561 --> 00:29.363
Ernie was our best
performing manager.

00:29.397 --> 00:30.398
He was killing it for us.

00:30.431 --> 00:31.565
- Should we be
freaking out?

00:31.599 --> 00:33.267
- No, fortunately
we never had

00:33.301 --> 00:35.069
enough money
to invest with him.

00:35.103 --> 00:35.503
My mother did.

00:35.536 --> 00:36.404
- Oh.

00:36.437 --> 00:37.271
- Candace?!

00:37.305 --> 00:38.372
- We didn't have
much money with him,

00:38.406 --> 00:39.640
did we?

00:39.673 --> 00:42.210
- Babe, we still
have each other.

00:42.243 --> 00:45.413
[screams]
- No!

00:45.446 --> 00:47.548
[gags]

00:50.484 --> 00:54.388
- I just can't
believe she's gone.

00:54.422 --> 00:55.556
I mean,
she was so beautiful,

00:55.589 --> 00:59.127
I mean, almost too
perfect to look at,

00:59.160 --> 01:01.429
like the teeth
of an Obama.

01:01.462 --> 01:02.630
- I'm sorry.

01:02.663 --> 01:04.432
I don't mean to interrupt--
But I- I- I--

01:04.465 --> 01:05.866
- Now she's
God only knows where

01:05.899 --> 01:09.470
with God only
knows who.

01:09.503 --> 01:11.439
I hate myself
for losing her!

01:11.472 --> 01:13.374
- Lex,
I'm a grief counselor

01:13.407 --> 01:16.210
for those who've
lost a loved one...

01:16.244 --> 01:17.511
Not a yacht.

01:17.545 --> 01:19.480
[sobs]

01:24.318 --> 01:26.420
- Are you all right?

01:26.454 --> 01:27.555
It's just you've
been standing here

01:27.588 --> 01:30.624
the better part
of an hour.

01:30.658 --> 01:32.226
Is there someone
I should call?

01:32.260 --> 01:34.195
- Who would you call?

01:34.228 --> 01:36.130
I had to fire
my Art Advisor.

01:36.164 --> 01:36.897
Now I'm expected
to figure out

01:36.930 --> 01:38.266
if I like
this painting.

01:38.299 --> 01:42.102
All. By. Myself!

01:46.374 --> 01:49.410
- Marisa?
Are you okay?

01:49.443 --> 01:51.212
- Jill.
You have no idea

01:51.245 --> 01:52.580
what I've just
been through.

01:52.613 --> 01:54.382
Our financial advisor
made us choose

01:54.415 --> 01:56.650
between the chalet
in Aspen

01:56.684 --> 02:00.221
and the horse farm
in Millbrook.

02:00.254 --> 02:01.589
It was a Sophie's Choice.

02:01.622 --> 02:03.391
- Have you ever read
Sophie's Choice?

02:03.424 --> 02:05.493
- Just be thankful
that you were not affected

02:05.526 --> 02:08.162
by that crook, Krevitts.

02:08.196 --> 02:09.463
- Oh, I was affected.

02:09.497 --> 02:11.332
- We're out of tonic.

02:11.365 --> 02:12.933
And I'd appreciate
if you'd invest

02:12.966 --> 02:15.203
in a removable
shower head.

02:18.539 --> 02:19.407
- Mother!?

02:21.409 --> 02:24.645
[theme music]
* Hey yes you know

02:24.678 --> 02:28.216
* I'm feeling fine
I'm feeling fine *

02:29.283 --> 02:32.220
- Dottie! Miles!
Let's hit the roadski!

02:32.253 --> 02:33.554
- Must you project
like that?

02:33.587 --> 02:36.357
You're not centerstage
on Broadway.

02:36.390 --> 02:38.292
- Rolling Eyes Emoji.

02:38.326 --> 02:39.393
- Just trying to get
the gang together

02:39.427 --> 02:42.463
to go visit Hazel at
sleep-away camp!

02:42.496 --> 02:43.397
You're gonna have
the place to yourself

02:43.431 --> 02:44.332
this weekend.

02:44.365 --> 02:45.366
- Ah, thank goodness.

02:45.399 --> 02:47.968
I haven't slept past eleven
since I moved in.

02:48.001 --> 02:50.271
I'm practically on
a day laborer's schedule.

02:50.304 --> 02:51.705
- I'm sorry, Grandma.

02:51.739 --> 02:54.242
- I thought I told you
never to use that word.

02:54.275 --> 02:55.576
I mean, really,

02:55.609 --> 02:57.311
do I look like
a grandmother?

02:57.345 --> 02:58.679
- You look like an angel.

02:58.712 --> 03:00.548
A fallen
Victoria's Secret angel.

03:00.581 --> 03:02.416
- Honey, I know
it has not been easy,

03:02.450 --> 03:03.784
but it's important that
we are supportive

03:03.817 --> 03:05.219
in her time of need.

03:05.253 --> 03:06.086
- 'Til when?

03:06.119 --> 03:08.289
The Grim Reaper buzzes
from the lobby?

03:08.322 --> 03:09.490
- Mother,
please turn off all the

03:09.523 --> 03:10.724
lights when you go out.

03:10.758 --> 03:13.494
And don't leave out
any food overnight and--

03:13.527 --> 03:14.728
- I suppose next
you're gonna tell me

03:14.762 --> 03:16.664
not to have
any boys over?

03:16.697 --> 03:19.233
- Actually, yeah.
We don't want any--

03:19.267 --> 03:22.603
- Ta-ta!
- Okay.

03:25.439 --> 03:26.740
- You know that your
mother's gonna throw

03:26.774 --> 03:28.309
an epic rager.

03:28.342 --> 03:30.010
We're gonna come home to
find Long Duck Dong

03:30.043 --> 03:32.413
on the exercise bike
and Anthony Michael Hall

03:32.446 --> 03:33.847
trapped under the
coffee table.

03:33.881 --> 03:35.416
- Don't be silly, honey.

03:35.449 --> 03:37.518
Life is not
a John Hughes movie.

03:37.551 --> 03:38.586
- You're right.
Otherwise I'd be married

03:38.619 --> 03:40.321
to Andrew McCarthy.

03:41.622 --> 03:44.458
- This city is one
crawdad boil away

03:44.492 --> 03:46.460
from being a swamp.
I'm dying.

03:46.494 --> 03:47.728
- Oh I know.
It's so hot

03:47.761 --> 03:49.763
the Statue of Liberty
is like--

03:49.797 --> 03:51.599
[sniffs and groans]

03:51.632 --> 03:53.567
- At least you're escaping
to the woods!

03:53.601 --> 03:55.636
I'll be here with
the cockroach conga line

03:55.669 --> 03:57.471
down Avenue A.

03:57.505 --> 03:58.706
- Are you still seeing
Krevitt victims

03:58.739 --> 04:01.342
in the ER from
rich person accidents?

04:01.375 --> 04:03.611
- Our burn unit
is inundated with people

04:03.644 --> 04:05.379
using their ovens
for the first time.

04:05.413 --> 04:07.615
- Seriously?
- And last night,

04:07.648 --> 04:08.716
a woman checked
in because

04:08.749 --> 04:10.551
she missed
having her call button.

04:10.584 --> 04:12.520
[cell phone rings]

04:12.553 --> 04:15.489
- Oh, let me guess, Graham?
- Yup.

04:15.523 --> 04:16.890
It's like four
FaceTimes a day!

04:16.924 --> 04:19.059
- It's still so weird to
me that he's in Burundi

04:19.092 --> 04:20.461
but can FaceTime.

04:20.494 --> 04:21.695
I was picturing him
in the bush

04:21.729 --> 04:24.432
with some tribeswoman
bringing him a telegram.

04:24.465 --> 04:25.866
With, like,
those neck rings--

04:25.899 --> 04:27.535
- Jill! No.

04:27.568 --> 04:30.070
It's impoverished there,
but it's still 2017.

04:30.103 --> 04:32.406
They don't have like,
bones through their nose.

04:32.440 --> 04:34.542
They're wearing, like,
Sean John t-shirts.

04:34.575 --> 04:36.377
- Stop it.
- I swear.

04:36.410 --> 04:37.110
- Time to go.

04:37.144 --> 04:38.679
- Okay, give this
to Hazel

04:38.712 --> 04:40.614
and tell that sweet
girl I love her!

04:40.648 --> 04:42.383
- Okay, and tell
Graham I say--

04:42.416 --> 04:44.518
[clicks tongue]
[mimics African dialect]

04:44.552 --> 04:45.386
- That means "hi".

04:45.419 --> 04:46.387
- You're going to hell.

04:46.420 --> 04:47.187
- I ought to hug you

04:47.220 --> 04:47.955
but I'm schvitzing
my balls off.

04:47.988 --> 04:49.523
- Don't touch me.
- Love you.

04:49.557 --> 04:51.625
[birds crowing]

04:53.894 --> 04:58.366
[scoffs]
[water splashing]

04:58.399 --> 05:01.402
[ding dong]
- Oh God.

05:01.435 --> 05:04.338
There's no one here
to answer it.

05:04.372 --> 05:07.375
Do you think I should
open it...myself?

05:07.908 --> 05:09.443
If I'm not back
in five minutes,

05:09.477 --> 05:11.645
eat Langley first.

05:16.717 --> 05:19.453
Oh Devon!
Thank God!

05:19.487 --> 05:20.821
There's someone
at the door.

05:20.854 --> 05:22.556
- It was me.

05:22.590 --> 05:24.458
- Ugh, you have no idea
what it's like

05:24.492 --> 05:27.561
being alone with these
unruly hellcats.

05:27.595 --> 05:29.597
If Ernie Krevitt
wasn't already in jail,

05:29.630 --> 05:31.565
I would murder him
for what he's done

05:31.599 --> 05:32.566
to this family.

05:32.600 --> 05:34.868
I had to cut my staff!
- [gasps]

05:34.902 --> 05:36.804
- From seven days
a week to five.

05:36.837 --> 05:38.672
We're living like animals.

05:38.706 --> 05:40.408
- What doesn't kill us,
makes us thinner.

05:40.441 --> 05:43.944
- Amen.
Kids, we need the kitchen.

05:43.977 --> 05:46.480
Go teach yourselves coding.

05:47.180 --> 05:48.649
Thank you so much
for coming, Devon.

05:48.682 --> 05:49.383
- Mm.

05:49.417 --> 05:50.818
- With Lex's fund
in limbo,

05:50.851 --> 05:52.953
my company's our only
source of income.

05:52.986 --> 05:54.154
- Mine too.

05:54.187 --> 05:55.188
- So give it
to me straight.

05:55.222 --> 05:57.691
What is the state of
the union with Von Weber?

05:57.725 --> 06:00.494
- As you know, we ordered
100,000 Native American

06:00.528 --> 06:01.962
inspired totes for
last season's

06:01.995 --> 06:03.464
Navawhore collection.

06:03.497 --> 06:06.166
- Still a great
looking bag!

06:06.199 --> 06:07.601
- Then Krevitt relieved
our target demo

06:07.635 --> 06:08.936
of all disposable income.

06:08.969 --> 06:12.873
- [sighs]
So how many did we sell?

06:12.906 --> 06:14.742
- 37,000.

06:14.775 --> 06:16.877
- You're telling me there's
$14 million dollars' worth

06:16.910 --> 06:18.879
of merchandise
just sitting there?

06:18.912 --> 06:19.913
- Like Ghandi.

06:19.947 --> 06:22.416
- [exasperated sigh]
We need people who weren't

06:22.450 --> 06:24.618
bank-raped by Krevitt
to start paying attention

06:24.652 --> 06:26.454
to Von Weber.

06:26.487 --> 06:29.757
- Who are they?
- [scoffs]

06:34.795 --> 06:37.030
- Does this paper chain
look ghettissimo ?

06:37.064 --> 06:39.633
I feel like it's all about
flash tattoos

06:39.667 --> 06:40.801
and drones these days.

06:40.834 --> 06:42.503
- Im just so excited
to see her.

06:42.536 --> 06:44.605
- How much farther?

06:44.638 --> 06:45.773
- Pull up the
"Are we there yet?"

06:45.806 --> 06:46.774
feature on your screen

06:46.807 --> 06:48.476
and track our
progress, hon.

06:48.509 --> 06:50.010
- I wonder if she's
gonna look different.

06:50.043 --> 06:51.645
Like, more developed.

06:51.679 --> 06:53.481
When she left
she had cherry tomatoes,

06:53.514 --> 06:55.649
but by now, they may be
full-on heirlooms.

06:55.683 --> 06:57.217
- Jill, it's only been
three and a half weeks!

06:57.250 --> 06:58.486
My parents
always said I'd grown

06:58.519 --> 06:59.920
two inches
by visiting day.

06:59.953 --> 07:01.889
- It says 11:45.

07:01.922 --> 07:03.724
- Why is Maine so far?

07:03.757 --> 07:06.226
- Guys, we're going to play
a wonderful game called:

07:06.259 --> 07:07.160
Silencio!

07:07.194 --> 07:09.930
Whoever's quiet the longest
gets a prize.

07:09.963 --> 07:11.532
- You've been doing
the vast majority

07:11.565 --> 07:12.666
of the talking.

07:12.700 --> 07:13.867
- What is the prize?

07:13.901 --> 07:15.569
- You don't know
until you win.

07:15.603 --> 07:16.704
Might be a snack,

07:16.737 --> 07:17.938
or a wad of cash,

07:17.971 --> 07:19.673
or a brand new family!

07:19.707 --> 07:21.709
Ready?
One, two, three:

07:21.742 --> 07:25.879
Silencio!

07:25.913 --> 07:28.782
B-T-dubs I got the new
parent volunteer forms

07:28.816 --> 07:30.951
for school and
I can't deal.

07:30.984 --> 07:33.554
Between prepping for
my Men in Uniform art show

07:33.587 --> 07:36.524
and your mom squatting
like the cast of "Rent",

07:36.557 --> 07:39.593
I could really use some
more support this fall.

07:41.695 --> 07:43.831
Um, if that pause were
any more pregnant

07:43.864 --> 07:45.766
it would have its
own show on MTV.

07:45.799 --> 07:47.868
- I just think you're
better at that stuff.

07:47.901 --> 07:49.837
- Better at pretending
to care about

07:49.870 --> 07:53.574
inconsequential shit during
interminable meetings?

07:53.607 --> 07:54.775
You're a lawyer.

07:54.808 --> 07:56.510
Didn't you go to
school for that?

07:56.544 --> 07:57.878
- Let's talk
about it later?

08:00.080 --> 08:02.516
Guys!
We're here!

08:02.550 --> 08:07.755
[rock music playing]

08:07.788 --> 08:09.289
- What's with all
the Lester's bags?

08:09.322 --> 08:10.591
- They should spell it

08:10.624 --> 08:11.992
L-E-S-T-I-Z-Z

08:12.025 --> 08:13.861
because everyone
who shops there

08:13.894 --> 08:15.829
call it "Lestizz."

08:15.863 --> 08:17.965
- How long 'til we
get to see Hazel?

08:17.998 --> 08:19.667
- Oh, are you
Hazel's family?

08:19.700 --> 08:21.602
- Yeah hi.
I'm Andy Weber.

08:21.635 --> 08:22.670
My wife, Jill.

08:22.703 --> 08:24.605
- Hi! I am Kara,
Remi's mom!

08:24.638 --> 08:27.741
- Remi?
- Hazel's BFF!

08:27.775 --> 08:28.909
I've heard all about
your daughter!

08:28.942 --> 08:30.010
How she taught
the whole cabin

08:30.043 --> 08:32.546
the Badunkadunk Shake.

08:32.580 --> 08:34.548
So, what did you
bring for Bunk Junk?

08:34.582 --> 08:37.050
- Oh um, the twins
decorated these cookies.

08:37.084 --> 08:38.552
How about you?

08:38.586 --> 08:40.588
- Oy, what didn't
we bring?

08:40.621 --> 08:42.022
We've got Zabar's
cold bags,

08:42.055 --> 08:43.791
we've got
Baked by Melissa,

08:43.824 --> 08:46.026
Mr. Chows and
Sushi of Gari

08:46.059 --> 08:48.128
'cause they miss the
ethnic so much up here.

08:48.161 --> 08:48.762
- But... isn't it hard

08:48.796 --> 08:49.897
to keep that stuff fresh?

08:49.930 --> 08:51.699
- No, we've got ice packs,

08:51.732 --> 08:54.067
and we were wheels
up about an hour ago, so.

08:54.101 --> 08:55.903
- Wh- what does
that mean?

08:55.936 --> 08:57.938
- That's the tail
number of our jet!

08:57.971 --> 08:59.873
It's like the
license plate.

08:59.907 --> 09:01.775
- Neat!?

09:01.809 --> 09:04.044
This place is like John
Galliano and Mel Gibson's

09:04.077 --> 09:06.046
worst nightmare.

09:06.079 --> 09:08.882
- Moms and Dads,
sisters and bros!

09:08.916 --> 09:10.984
Who's ready to see
their campers?

09:11.018 --> 09:14.955
[cheers]
- Yes!

09:14.988 --> 09:15.723
- I'm so glad
we got Hazel

09:15.756 --> 09:17.057
up here in nature
for a while.

09:17.090 --> 09:18.659
Out of the rat race
of the city.

09:18.692 --> 09:24.665
- Ready, set, go!

[energetic rock music]
[people chattering]

09:30.904 --> 09:33.741
- Mom, are you okay?

09:33.774 --> 09:36.143
- That was Pamplona.

09:36.176 --> 09:38.045
But with Jews.

09:38.078 --> 09:39.947
- Okay, she's okay.
Come on!

09:39.980 --> 09:44.084
[rock music continues]

09:44.117 --> 09:44.652
- There she is!

09:44.685 --> 09:46.720
There's my little girl!

09:48.856 --> 09:51.391
- See I told you she'd
look more grown up.

10:06.406 --> 10:07.140
- Yay! La Durée!
I love you, mom.

10:09.142 --> 10:13.681
- Hon, be sure to share
with the less fortunate.

10:13.714 --> 10:15.816
- Are jacks not
a thing still?

10:15.849 --> 10:17.718
- Thanks, Mom, I
love everything.

10:17.751 --> 10:19.352
- Oh my God!

10:19.386 --> 10:21.321
It's just like I'm
walking through a forest!

10:21.354 --> 10:23.256
- I know.
Incredible, right?

10:23.290 --> 10:24.692
- I like what you've done
with your area.

10:24.725 --> 10:28.762
It's really creative.
- Thanks.

10:28.796 --> 10:31.098
- Jill, get over here.

10:31.131 --> 10:33.100
- What's wrong?
- Look!

10:33.133 --> 10:34.334
- Babe, that's sweet!

10:34.367 --> 10:36.003
- Who is this JR person?

10:36.036 --> 10:38.038
- Calm down.
Crushes are as much

10:38.071 --> 10:39.840
a part of camp
as pink eye.

10:39.873 --> 10:42.710
- Remi, show the Webers
the dance Hazel taught you.

10:42.743 --> 10:45.012
It is the cutest.

got a fat ass *

10:52.753 --> 10:55.022
* Damn my girl
got a flat ass *

10:55.055 --> 10:57.124

* Shorty got that

10:59.492 --> 11:01.328
- I'm smelling toast.

11:01.361 --> 11:02.830
Isn't that a sign
of a stroke?

11:02.863 --> 11:04.264
- Adorable, right?

11:04.297 --> 11:06.099
My Remi is a
danceaholic.

11:06.133 --> 11:08.135
She's on a competitive
team in Boca.

11:08.168 --> 11:09.036
- I want to start
dance class

11:09.069 --> 11:10.270
this fall, too, Mom.

11:10.303 --> 11:13.040
- Sure, as long as the
barre is horizontal

11:13.073 --> 11:14.842
and not vertical.

11:14.875 --> 11:16.877
- This isn't funny.
We're losing her.

11:16.910 --> 11:19.479
- Relax. It'll
twerk itself out.

11:19.512 --> 11:22.182
- Mommy, can you
get me the jacks ball?

11:22.215 --> 11:25.118
- Sure honey.

You shaved?!

11:30.791 --> 11:32.793
* I told y'all
she the shit *

11:33.761 --> 11:35.162
- So here is the plan.

11:35.195 --> 11:38.298
We gift the major influencer
of each group a bag.

11:38.331 --> 11:40.067
Then their friends
will buy buy buy,

11:40.100 --> 11:41.434

Instagram'ing us

11:41.468 --> 11:42.402
into the black,
black, black.

11:42.435 --> 11:45.405
- Hm, it's basic trickle
down Brookenomics.

11:45.438 --> 11:46.473
It has to work!

11:46.506 --> 11:49.442
Okay for our web of
influencers we have identified

11:49.476 --> 11:53.113
hip-hop baby mommas
for the urban demographic.

11:53.146 --> 11:56.183
Second-tier telenovela stars
for the latina market.

11:56.216 --> 11:59.753
And NFL wives--
- A Von Weber on the arm

11:59.787 --> 12:03.156
of a game-day jersey?
It just doesn't feel right.

12:03.190 --> 12:04.091
- Think of all your idols

12:04.124 --> 12:06.226
who've had to endure
mainstream success.

12:06.259 --> 12:08.161
Ralph Lauren, Tory Burch--

12:08.195 --> 12:11.865
- Tommy Hilfiger practically
pioneered the hi low strategy.

12:11.899 --> 12:12.900
- Exactly.

12:12.933 --> 12:16.236
- Oh, I'm DMing you
India Gants's latest post.

12:16.269 --> 12:19.139
She's beachside in
Montauk with Dot the Rapper

12:19.172 --> 12:20.808
wearing the cutest suit.

12:20.841 --> 12:22.109
Track it down for me?

12:22.142 --> 12:24.845
- I'll buy anything
that she's selling.

12:25.412 --> 12:28.315
- Devon, we're a genius!

12:28.348 --> 12:29.249
Forget the local Brookes.

12:29.282 --> 12:31.184
One big Brooke would
sell all these bags

12:31.218 --> 12:32.352
in a heartbeat.

12:32.385 --> 12:33.353
- Perfect!

12:33.386 --> 12:35.255
We know she's
already beachside,

12:35.288 --> 12:36.824
so I'll just
deliver the bag!

12:36.857 --> 12:38.225
- No gifting.

12:38.258 --> 12:41.328
America's Next Top
Model could gag on swag.

12:41.361 --> 12:43.463
We're going to need
to be stealth.

12:43.496 --> 12:44.297
- If a model owns a bag,

12:44.331 --> 12:45.833
but doesn't take a
picture with it,

12:45.866 --> 12:47.801
did it even exist in
the first place?

12:47.835 --> 12:48.969
- Exactly.

12:49.002 --> 12:51.138
We gonna need ankle boots
on the ground

12:51.171 --> 12:53.340
to cleverly place a
Von Weber bag

12:53.373 --> 12:57.577
in her next selfie, ideally
without her noticing.

12:57.610 --> 13:01.548
But I am on house arrest
with my demon spawn.

13:05.252 --> 13:07.587
- I'll do
whatever you need.

13:07.620 --> 13:09.156
- Swim-suit up.

13:09.189 --> 13:10.223
I'm sending you in.

13:10.257 --> 13:11.524

13:16.429 --> 13:17.998
- Mom, all the
girls shave!

13:18.031 --> 13:19.166
I was a yeti.

13:19.199 --> 13:21.168
- Yes, but you're
a blonde yeti!

13:21.201 --> 13:23.370
No one sees it
unless the sun hits it.

13:23.403 --> 13:25.172
- Which is all the
time in summer.

13:25.205 --> 13:27.374
- Look, once you start,
you can't stop.

13:27.407 --> 13:29.009
Shaving is like
a gateway drug.

13:29.042 --> 13:30.577
- To what?

13:30.610 --> 13:32.913
- Shaving other
things? I don't know.

13:32.946 --> 13:34.447
Just take your time.

13:34.481 --> 13:36.583
Don't just go
with the flow.

13:36.616 --> 13:38.919
Wait, you didn't
get your period, did you?

13:38.952 --> 13:40.187
- No.

13:40.220 --> 13:42.856
- Phew! Yeah, eleven's
way too young.

13:42.890 --> 13:44.357
- But Remi and Mollie have.

13:44.391 --> 13:46.193
- What?

13:46.226 --> 13:47.327
- Jill, it's normal.

13:47.360 --> 13:48.962
- What are you
talking about?

13:48.996 --> 13:51.531
We didn't have boobs
and pubes then.

13:51.564 --> 13:53.033
Her bunkmates have
legit knockers

13:53.066 --> 13:54.567
and crimson
tides.

13:54.601 --> 13:55.936
- It's environmental.

13:55.969 --> 13:57.237
Because there's hormones

13:57.270 --> 13:58.605
in milk and
chicken nuggets,

13:58.638 --> 14:00.573
the national menarche
has plummeted.

14:00.607 --> 14:02.342
- What the hell
is a menarche?

14:02.375 --> 14:03.911
- A girl's first period.

14:03.944 --> 14:05.512
I think it's Greek
for "beginning."

14:05.545 --> 14:07.380
- I can't accept
that girls Hazel's age

14:07.414 --> 14:09.016
are on their Raggedy Ann.

14:09.049 --> 14:10.450
And I'm not even
the one freaking out.

14:10.483 --> 14:12.886
Andy's ready to FedEx
her to a convent.

14:12.920 --> 14:17.657
- Hang on.
First time using an iron?

14:17.690 --> 14:19.426
Yeah, you can't press
the clothes

14:19.459 --> 14:21.061
when they're on
your body.

14:21.094 --> 14:22.129
I'll treat the burn

14:22.162 --> 14:25.232
and give you a prescription
for an ironing board.

14:26.533 --> 14:27.935
I gotta go.

14:27.968 --> 14:30.037
Rich people require
supervision.

14:30.070 --> 14:31.338
- Tell me about it.

back on and get that snap.

you embarrass me--

And how does it

come from?

you master backspin

in tetherball.

15:59.392 --> 16:00.360

- Do I look
like an idiot?

17:33.386 --> 17:36.089
- No, you look stunning

17:36.123 --> 17:38.325
and that bag
really suits you.

17:38.358 --> 17:40.560
- Listen, sister,
I ain't mad at hustle,

17:40.593 --> 17:42.495
but don't ever
try to hustle me.

17:42.529 --> 17:43.796
- See,
I went rogue.

17:43.830 --> 17:45.365
She knew nothing
about this.

17:45.398 --> 17:47.867
- Well, according to
my bodyguard,

17:47.900 --> 17:49.336
he was wearing
a headset

17:49.369 --> 17:51.238
and reporting his
every move.

17:51.271 --> 17:52.305
I could sue.

17:52.339 --> 17:53.106
Do you have any idea
how much money

17:53.140 --> 17:55.342
I get paid for
an endorsement?

17:55.375 --> 17:58.511
- India, from one
incredibly attractive

17:58.545 --> 18:00.813
businesswoman to
another,

18:00.847 --> 18:04.251
please accept my
sincerest apologies.

18:04.284 --> 18:07.220
And hey,
you keep the bag, huh?

18:07.254 --> 18:09.356
- Oh I'm keeping it.

18:10.523 --> 18:13.260
- I have one with
turquoise accents as well,

18:13.293 --> 18:16.596
that would really
complement your eyes.

18:16.629 --> 18:18.598
- You're lucky
your shit's cute.

18:18.631 --> 18:20.433
What else you got?

18:21.668 --> 18:24.837
- Right this way.
- Come in.

18:25.472 --> 18:29.409
* Welcome to my palace
to my palace *

18:29.442 --> 18:30.477
* Walking on these diamonds

18:30.510 --> 18:33.446
* Tell 'em who the baddest
who's the baddest *

18:33.480 --> 18:35.315
* Just tell them who's
the baddest *

18:35.348 --> 18:36.916
* Looking at my necklace

18:36.949 --> 18:38.651
* I know you feeling precious

18:38.685 --> 18:40.420
* Open up the eyes

18:40.453 --> 18:42.655
* Look at all this madness
bitch *

18:42.689 --> 18:43.590
* I'm rich

18:43.623 --> 18:45.858
[ding dong]

18:50.330 --> 18:52.865
- What seems to be
the problem, Officer?

18:52.899 --> 18:55.435
- Someone reported
a disturbance in here, ma'am.

18:55.468 --> 18:57.870
- Really?
I can't imagine why.

18:57.904 --> 19:01.541
- Because something
disturbing is happening.

19:12.785 --> 19:13.253
- Mm, great Frosé babe.

19:14.787 --> 19:16.256
Seriously,
I am so proud of you.

19:16.289 --> 19:18.925
Juggling your job
and the kids all weekend

19:18.958 --> 19:21.261
all without the staff.

19:21.294 --> 19:24.331
And kind of without me.

19:24.731 --> 19:27.734
Look, I know I've been a
little lost lately--

19:27.767 --> 19:31.904
- Sh.
Babe, look!

19:31.938 --> 19:33.473
Isn't that the most
beautiful thing

19:33.506 --> 19:38.778
you've ever seen?
The nannies.

19:38.811 --> 19:40.480
[deep sighs]

19:44.417 --> 19:48.455
[slurp drinks]

19:48.488 --> 19:49.556
- You know what,

19:49.589 --> 19:51.724
I am going to volunteer at
Hazel's school this year

19:51.758 --> 19:53.226
like you suggested.

19:53.260 --> 19:55.928
- That's great...
but tread lightly.

19:55.962 --> 19:58.498
'Cause if you hover too low,
she could rebel

19:58.531 --> 20:01.868
and become a conservative,
or a vegan.

20:01.901 --> 20:03.470
- But if I keep
tabs on her--

20:03.503 --> 20:04.937
- Everyone says
kids today are

20:04.971 --> 20:06.339
"growing up so fast"

20:06.373 --> 20:07.974
because of technology
and everything,

20:08.007 --> 20:09.942
but I think it was way worse
when I was a kid.

20:09.976 --> 20:13.380
There was nothing else to
do but experiment.

20:13.413 --> 20:15.282
- Yeah. Lex and I
used to go out to

20:15.315 --> 20:16.716
Sheep's Meadow and
see how high

20:16.749 --> 20:18.751
we could shoot up
model rockets.

20:18.785 --> 20:21.821
- Oh, I meant
experiment sexually.

20:21.854 --> 20:23.022
At my bat-mitzvah

20:23.055 --> 20:24.991
Jenn Linardos gave
Trip Cullman a handjob

20:25.024 --> 20:27.294
on the putting green
at our club.

20:27.327 --> 20:30.563
Everyone called her
the 19th hole after that.

20:30.597 --> 20:32.832
- Is that supposed to
make me feel better?

20:32.865 --> 20:34.834
- Well, that's
two years away,

20:34.867 --> 20:37.537
and she was the
fastest one in our group.

20:37.570 --> 20:38.771
- I have a good idea.

20:38.805 --> 20:40.006
Let's play that game:

20:40.039 --> 20:42.409
Silencio!

20:47.414 --> 20:49.849
- Wow!

20:49.882 --> 20:51.851
- Welcome back!

20:51.884 --> 20:54.587
- Thank you, Candace.
The place looks perfect.

20:54.621 --> 20:57.890
- I'm shocked you would
expect anything less.

20:57.924 --> 20:58.991
- Goodnight, Mother.

20:59.025 --> 21:00.760
- Sweet dreams, honey!

21:04.497 --> 21:05.898
[coughs]

21:13.640 --> 21:18.345
[whistles]
Third door on the left.

21:23.650 --> 21:24.617
