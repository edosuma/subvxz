00:02.749 --> 00:04.283
Previously, on <i>Smash</i>...

00:04.655 --> 00:07.373
Mom. They want me
to play Marilyn Monroe.

00:07.408 --> 00:10.193
I'm just pretending to be brave.
I'm scared to death.

00:10.227 --> 00:12.245
I need to stop
sleeping with men

00:12.279 --> 00:14.914
who are complete
narcissistic pricks!

00:14.997 --> 00:16.714
Okay.

00:16.748 --> 00:19.450
This workshop goes up in front
of an audience in a week.

00:19.501 --> 00:21.085
No one is gonna buy it.

00:21.119 --> 00:23.454
You're making
a fool of yourself.

00:24.260 --> 00:26.062
Bobby Raskin was there?

00:26.097 --> 00:28.815
He's big. He's like,
Tommy Mottola.

00:30.249 --> 00:32.033
I have to see you.

00:34.194 --> 00:36.294
Smash
s01 ep07 - the workshop

00:36.699 --> 00:40.199
Sync and corrected by dr.jackson
for www.addic7ed.com

00:41.847 --> 00:46.184
- You look good today.
- You too.

00:46.202 --> 00:47.869
You giving
my actors notes?

00:47.904 --> 00:49.321
I changed
a lyric without asking.

00:49.355 --> 00:50.322
Were they any good?

00:50.356 --> 00:53.291
Pretty good.

00:53.326 --> 00:56.044
Okay, so,
what's this new lyric?

00:56.078 --> 01:00.048
I'll go get it.

01:00.082 --> 01:02.334
Is it hot in here?
It's really hot in here!

01:02.368 --> 01:04.669
I actually just overheard
the building manager talking.

01:04.703 --> 01:06.471
He said there's a problem
with the boiler.

01:06.505 --> 01:08.706
- Okay, I'll go talk to him.
- It's ridiculously hot.

01:08.724 --> 01:10.392
We've got investors
coming in tomorrow!

01:31.414 --> 01:33.031
You're late.

01:33.065 --> 01:34.366
I know, sorry.
The train.

01:34.400 --> 01:37.202
Are you Mr. Raskin?...

01:37.236 --> 01:39.037
I guess not.

01:39.071 --> 01:43.375
Let's get this over with.

01:46.078 --> 01:47.846
- Yo, stop, stop.
- Sorry.

01:47.880 --> 01:49.264
Trying to blow out
my speakers?

01:49.298 --> 01:51.716
I'm really
more of a stage performer.

01:51.750 --> 01:54.219
Back up from the mic.

01:56.272 --> 01:58.273
d Stop me on the corner d

01:58.307 --> 02:00.725
d I swear you hit me
like a vision d

02:00.759 --> 02:03.278
d I-I-I wasn't expecting d

02:03.312 --> 02:05.113
d but who am I to tell fate d

02:05.147 --> 02:07.782
d where it's supposed to go
with it d

02:07.817 --> 02:10.035
d don't you blink,
you might miss it d

02:10.068 --> 02:12.603
d see, we got a right
to just love it or leave it d

02:12.622 --> 02:14.706
d you find it and keep it d

02:14.740 --> 02:16.774
d 'cause it ain't every day
you get the chance to say d

02:16.792 --> 02:20.245
d oh, this is
how it starts d

02:20.279 --> 02:23.131
d lightning
strikes the heart d

02:23.165 --> 02:25.300
d it goes off like a gun d

02:25.334 --> 02:26.784
d brighter than the sun d

02:26.802 --> 02:30.138
d oh, we could
be the stars d

02:30.172 --> 02:32.390
d falling from the sky d

02:32.425 --> 02:35.810
d shining how we want d

02:35.845 --> 02:37.795
d brighter than the sun d

02:37.813 --> 02:40.065
d everything is like
a whiteout d

02:40.099 --> 02:42.434
d 'cause we shook-a
shook-a shine down d

02:42.468 --> 02:44.986
d even when the...
When the light's out d

02:45.021 --> 02:47.656
d but I can see you glow d

02:47.690 --> 02:50.158
d got my head
up in the rafters d

02:50.192 --> 02:52.577
d got me happy ever after d

02:52.611 --> 02:54.913
d never felt
this way before d

02:54.947 --> 02:56.647
d ain't felt
this way before d

02:56.666 --> 03:00.251
d oh, this is
how it starts d

03:00.286 --> 03:02.754
d lightning
strikes the heart d

03:02.788 --> 03:05.323
d it goes off like a gun d

03:05.341 --> 03:06.657
d brighter than the sun d

03:06.676 --> 03:10.261
d oh, this is

03:10.296 --> 03:12.764

03:12.798 --> 03:15.183
d it goes off like a gun d

03:15.217 --> 03:19.471
d brighter than the sun d

03:19.505 --> 03:22.757
- That was beautiful.
- Thanks.

03:22.792 --> 03:24.342
I think I love you.

03:26.011 --> 03:29.013
Let go of me.

03:29.031 --> 03:30.982
I have this other lyric
I needed to talk to you about.

03:39.408 --> 03:41.159
Julia.

03:41.193 --> 03:45.380
Derek has some questions
about the breakup scene.

03:46.414 --> 03:47.514
Did Ivy get here?

03:47.549 --> 03:50.479
Still hunting her down, but
he doesn't want to wait.

03:50.480 --> 03:52.703
They're looking for you both.

04:14.400 --> 04:16.800
Look, I talked with you about this,
two hours ago.

04:16.827 --> 04:19.209
I called the plumber
as soon as you spoke to me.

04:19.305 --> 04:20.790
And yet we still
have a problem with the heat?

04:20.808 --> 04:22.342
What can I say?
It's New York.

04:22.393 --> 04:24.510
Those guys...
They're on their own schedule.

04:24.561 --> 04:26.312
Perhaps you could
call again.

04:26.347 --> 04:29.298
I have an extremely important
workshop happening in 24 hours.

04:29.316 --> 04:31.067
I would be happy
to do that.

04:31.101 --> 04:33.820
It's just they got contracts
on a lot of buildings.

04:33.854 --> 04:35.988
They can't always get the guys
over here right away!

04:36.023 --> 04:38.491
- Where's Arthur Miller?
- Back here.

04:38.525 --> 04:39.809
I'm gonna need
to change your entrance.

04:39.827 --> 04:41.944
Guys.

04:41.978 --> 04:43.913
- So, how'd it go?
- Pretty good.

04:43.947 --> 04:45.815
A little weird. The studio was,
like, state of the art.

04:45.833 --> 04:47.116
I've never seen
anything like it before.

04:47.150 --> 04:48.317
Where were you?

04:48.335 --> 04:50.002
Cutting a demo
for Bobby Raskin.

04:50.037 --> 04:52.004
- Shut up.
- My God.

04:52.039 --> 04:54.006
They... they want me back.

04:54.041 --> 04:55.425
- What?
- I have to go back.

04:55.459 --> 04:56.509
They want me back
at the recording studio,

04:56.543 --> 04:58.094
like, right now.
What do I do?

04:58.128 --> 04:59.595
Here.

04:59.630 --> 05:01.497
Linda...

05:01.515 --> 05:03.015
Karen has to take off
for an hour or two.

05:03.050 --> 05:04.684
Is that gonna be okay?

05:04.718 --> 05:06.302
- Sure thing.
- Go.

05:06.336 --> 05:07.603
Go, go, go, go, go.

05:07.638 --> 05:09.439
We're so late.

05:09.473 --> 05:11.858
Well, traffic was never like
this when I lived in New York.

05:11.892 --> 05:13.476
I know, mom.

05:13.510 --> 05:15.344
That's why I said
we should take the subway.

05:15.362 --> 05:19.816
My God.
Does this take me back.

05:19.850 --> 05:21.200
Derek.

05:21.235 --> 05:23.986
Derek Wells.
I know you by reputation.

05:24.020 --> 05:25.621
Leigh Conroy.

05:25.656 --> 05:27.373
My mother.

05:27.408 --> 05:28.958
You never told me
your mother was Leigh Conroy.

05:28.992 --> 05:30.793
She is,
and she's quite contrite

05:30.828 --> 05:32.962
at having caused
the late arrival of your star.

05:32.996 --> 05:34.864
I told her a cab
would take too long,

05:34.882 --> 05:36.198
but she won't
take the subway.

05:36.216 --> 05:37.884
Not in heels I won't.

05:40.921 --> 05:42.138
Ivy was quite reluctant
to let me come.

05:42.172 --> 05:43.890
It's an honor
to have you.

05:43.924 --> 05:47.009
Ms. Conroy, forgive me.
You've been such an inspiration.

05:47.043 --> 05:49.479
No need for me
to forgive you for that.

05:49.513 --> 05:51.397
Sing something!

05:51.432 --> 05:53.349
No, I couldn't.

05:53.383 --> 05:55.651
We do have a lot
to get through today.

05:55.686 --> 05:56.986
Do <i>Everything's</i>
<i>coming up roses.</i>

05:57.020 --> 05:58.554
- Yeah.
- I couldn't.

05:58.572 --> 06:00.189
Come on,
please, please.

06:00.223 --> 06:01.741
I saw you do it
when I was eight,

06:01.775 --> 06:03.192
at the Westport Country
Playhouse... you were amazing.

06:03.226 --> 06:05.862
Unfortunately,
our pianist is running late.

06:05.896 --> 06:08.998
Don't be ridiculous.
I know it.

06:20.711 --> 06:23.245
d I had a dream d

06:23.263 --> 06:26.916

08:20.330 --> 08:21.964
My God,
I can't believe she's here!

08:21.999 --> 08:24.383
My God.

08:24.418 --> 08:25.418
Ho ho!

08:31.541 --> 08:34.744
10:00 in the morning,
she sounds like that.

08:34.778 --> 08:37.346
So are we good?

08:37.380 --> 08:39.815
Fine.

08:39.850 --> 08:42.684
Listen.

08:42.719 --> 08:46.405
I know I don't
say this enough, but...

08:46.440 --> 08:50.826
You're wonderful
in this show.

08:50.861 --> 08:54.697
Thank you.

08:54.731 --> 08:56.532
And you're gonna
be great tomorrow.

09:03.957 --> 09:07.343
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, and grab her.

09:07.377 --> 09:09.679
It's even hotter in here
than it was before.

09:09.713 --> 09:10.930
Sweltering.

09:10.964 --> 09:12.214
- Daddy, daddy!
- Daddy's working.

09:12.248 --> 09:14.433
I'm sorry.

09:14.468 --> 09:16.185
We were in the neighborhood,
so...

09:16.219 --> 09:17.920
- What do you got?
- I've got a golden hat.

09:17.938 --> 09:19.689
I see that.

09:19.723 --> 09:22.074
He wanted
to dress up like daddy.

09:25.562 --> 09:27.947
The child thing
never ceases to perplex me.

09:27.981 --> 09:32.601
- Because you're a reptile.
- Excuse me.

09:32.619 --> 09:36.188
Did I
say something?

09:36.223 --> 09:41.210
That's the least offensive thing
I've said in days.

09:41.244 --> 09:43.295
You as well.

09:48.952 --> 09:51.253
Julia.

09:51.287 --> 09:52.922
I thought
I had to throw up.

09:52.956 --> 09:54.289
I'm okay.

09:54.307 --> 09:56.142
Well, that's good.

09:56.176 --> 09:58.561
'Cause I think this gentleman
is waiting to get his bike.

09:58.595 --> 10:02.464
Sorry.
You gonna be okay?

10:02.482 --> 10:04.567
Julia, what did...

10:04.601 --> 10:08.738
My God.
You did, didn't you?

10:08.772 --> 10:11.657
You slept with him?

10:11.692 --> 10:14.076
I have to go home.

10:14.111 --> 10:15.911
I'm sorry. You have to finish
the day without me.

10:15.946 --> 10:19.115
I have to...
I have to go home.

10:29.767 --> 10:31.587
Where the hell is she?

10:32.193 --> 10:33.827
Has anybody seen Julia?

10:33.861 --> 10:35.528
She had to go home.

10:35.562 --> 10:37.497
Well, we need to work
on <i>Lexington and 52nd street.</i>

10:37.531 --> 10:38.898
I'm here. Let's work.

10:38.916 --> 10:40.433
No, the song is fine.
The book needs work.

10:40.468 --> 10:42.202
- It's the dialogue. Eileen.
- She just left?

10:42.236 --> 10:43.737
Yup. Had to go home.

10:43.771 --> 10:45.088
Well, she does realize
the workshop is tomorrow.

10:45.122 --> 10:46.423
I need something
to work on.

10:46.457 --> 10:47.991
Linda, find me
something to work on.

10:48.025 --> 10:49.926
- Eileen.
- Ellis.

10:49.960 --> 10:51.378
Can I talk to you
for a second?

10:51.412 --> 10:54.080
Sure.

10:54.098 --> 10:57.550
This is difficult, but you
really need to know this.

10:57.584 --> 11:00.720
Julia is having an affair
with Michael Swift.

11:00.754 --> 11:03.606
It's why she's been
so erratic with the pages.

11:03.641 --> 11:05.358
It's completely out of control.
They...

11:05.393 --> 11:07.027
That's enough.

11:07.061 --> 11:08.778
I won't pretend
this isn't useful information,

11:08.813 --> 11:10.280
because it is.

11:10.314 --> 11:11.731
But if I hear you've
repeated this to anyone,

11:11.765 --> 11:13.199
you'll never
work on this production

11:13.234 --> 11:15.068
or in this town again.

11:15.102 --> 11:17.570
- Do we understand each other?
- Yes.

11:17.604 --> 11:19.772
Good.

11:39.460 --> 11:40.977
Mom. What...
What're you doing here?

11:41.011 --> 11:42.395
I live here.

11:42.430 --> 11:43.897
You're supposed to be
at rehearsal.

11:43.931 --> 11:44.964
You're supposed
to be not smoking pot.

11:44.982 --> 11:46.433
Mason, would you
get out of here?

11:46.467 --> 11:48.902
Yeah.
Sure, Mrs. Houston.

11:48.936 --> 11:51.488
Don't be so polite,
you little drug addict.

11:51.522 --> 11:55.308
My workshop is tomorrow. You
know what I'm in the middle of!

11:55.326 --> 11:57.177
I do know what you're
in the middle of.

11:57.211 --> 12:00.947
And I think it sucks,
and I think you suck.

12:07.800 --> 12:09.184
He's got millions,
he's got glasses...

12:09.218 --> 12:12.203
- He's got a yacht.
- You don't say.

12:12.389 --> 12:14.606
He's not only got a yacht,
he's got a bicycle!

12:14.640 --> 12:20.260
That Derek's very charming.
And so handsome.

12:20.459 --> 12:21.943
Mom...

12:21.525 --> 12:23.310
He's a very
important director.

12:23.344 --> 12:25.362
I'm not so sure I'd let him
slip out of my hands.

12:25.396 --> 12:28.031
I am not talking
about this with you.

12:28.065 --> 12:30.317
You poor thing.

12:30.351 --> 12:32.786
I was over getting nervous
by the time I was your age,

12:32.820 --> 12:34.788
but you're used
to the ensemble.

12:34.822 --> 12:37.857
It's not nerves,
it's the prednisone.

12:37.875 --> 12:39.692
I got these
sleeping pills,

12:39.710 --> 12:42.329
but I don't want to start taking
one thing on top of another.

12:42.363 --> 12:45.448
I won a Tony
without any of it.

12:45.483 --> 12:49.803
Look at that magnetism.

12:49.837 --> 12:52.205
No wonder you're nervous.

12:52.239 --> 12:54.674
I don't know how you're
gonna pull that off.

12:59.347 --> 13:00.563
What do you think,
Josephine?

13:00.598 --> 13:03.066
What does it say
in your crystal ball?

13:03.100 --> 13:06.336
- Nobody?
- Well, it's a union contract.

13:06.370 --> 13:07.737
Nobody wants
to step on that.

13:07.772 --> 13:09.572
It's a problem.

13:09.607 --> 13:11.024
Don't talk to me
about problems with unions.

13:11.058 --> 13:12.993
- I work in the theater.
- Well, I...

13:13.027 --> 13:14.861
I did find somebody
that said he would step in,

13:14.895 --> 13:16.529
but he mostly
spoke Chinese,

13:16.564 --> 13:18.164
and I couldn't understand
what he wanted.

13:18.199 --> 13:19.732
What do you mean,
"what he wanted"?

13:19.750 --> 13:21.351
Well, just
in terms of money.

13:21.385 --> 13:23.586
I've never heard
of a Chinese plumber before.

13:23.621 --> 13:26.039
So you live
on the lower east side,

13:26.073 --> 13:27.707
and you've never heard
of a Chinese plumber.

13:27.741 --> 13:29.509
I'm new
to the neighborhood.

13:29.543 --> 13:31.044
You know, I've got
a guy lives upstairs.

13:31.078 --> 13:32.545
He did this whole place.

13:32.580 --> 13:35.115
Plumbing, wiring,
not exactly licensed,

13:35.149 --> 13:36.433
but he knows
what he's doing.

13:36.467 --> 13:38.218
He knows
what he's doing?

13:38.252 --> 13:39.752
Absolutely.

13:39.770 --> 13:41.838
- Does he speak English?
- Yeah, he speaks English.

13:41.872 --> 13:45.025
He's illegal, so he prefers
things a little under the table.

13:45.059 --> 13:47.560
Well, get him down here.

14:24.932 --> 14:28.935
I slept like a rock.

14:38.028 --> 14:40.914
The big day.

14:40.948 --> 14:43.149
The workshop.

14:48.839 --> 14:51.591
Who on earth is calling you
at 6:00 in the morning?

14:51.625 --> 14:52.792
Bobby Raskin.

15:00.026 --> 15:02.826
Bobby Raskin called,
and he wants to meet you.

15:03.481 --> 15:06.182
That's incredible.
Like, crazy incredible.

15:06.200 --> 15:07.651
No, no, no,
you don't understand.

15:07.685 --> 15:09.202
He wants to meet me now,
like in half an hour.

15:09.237 --> 15:10.316
They said it's the only time,

15:10.317 --> 15:11.656
and then he's leaving for a month.

15:11.748 --> 15:15.668
He's going somewhere
in Europe or Dubai or something.

15:16.750 --> 15:17.950
What is with her?

15:17.968 --> 15:19.886
Don't worry about Ivy.

15:19.920 --> 15:21.637
Why aren't you
on your way over there?

15:21.672 --> 15:23.806
We're starting in half
an hour... I'd miss the workshop.

15:23.841 --> 15:26.125
You're making
$200 a week in this.

15:26.143 --> 15:28.461
You're in the chorus, and Bobby
Raskin wants to meet with you.

15:28.479 --> 15:30.813
You think
I should just leave?

15:30.848 --> 15:32.465
I think it's
a crazy opportunity.

15:32.483 --> 15:34.567
We'll be fine.
You're in the chorus.

15:34.601 --> 15:36.302
Nobody will hold it
against you.

15:36.320 --> 15:37.937
Even Derek will understand.

15:37.971 --> 15:39.805
Well, I just
would never do that.

15:39.823 --> 15:41.491
I just wouldn't do that.

15:43.426 --> 15:46.645
Looks like
the boiler room.

15:46.680 --> 15:48.097
It's locked, though.

16:00.026 --> 16:02.895
May I?

16:02.913 --> 16:05.898
Thank you.

16:09.419 --> 16:12.504
No, no, no, no.
Who was that for?

16:12.539 --> 16:14.239
My soon-to-be
ex-husband.

16:14.257 --> 16:16.091
Despite how this looks,

16:16.126 --> 16:18.076
this is all
perfectly legitimate.

16:18.094 --> 16:20.129
Whatever you say.

16:23.717 --> 16:25.517
Michael.

16:25.552 --> 16:27.436
- Hey, you.
- No.

16:27.470 --> 16:32.024
Leo knows.

16:34.227 --> 16:37.279
That's,

16:37.314 --> 16:38.397
That's something.

16:38.431 --> 16:40.399
Yeah.

16:40.433 --> 16:43.101
And you have
that beautiful son.

16:43.119 --> 16:44.269
How could you
not think of him?

16:44.287 --> 16:45.905
Don't do this
to me again.

16:45.939 --> 16:48.073
- You know I'm right.
- I don't know that.

16:48.107 --> 16:50.709
I need you both.

16:50.744 --> 16:52.544
They're coming.

16:52.579 --> 16:55.547
And can we please just
listen to it one last time?

16:55.582 --> 17:00.386
Okay, I'm asking nicely.
It's just not working.

17:00.420 --> 17:02.721
Let's have a run at it,
could we?

17:02.756 --> 17:05.140
Okay,

17:05.175 --> 17:06.925
You're being ridiculous.

17:06.960 --> 17:08.978
Yeah, it's great.
Terrific. You're out there,

17:09.012 --> 17:10.561
all of New York
is staring up your skirt.

17:10.597 --> 17:12.231
- It's just publicity.
- It's dirty.

17:12.265 --> 17:16.484
- It's filthy.
- Joe.

17:16.519 --> 17:18.771
Can we hold?

17:18.805 --> 17:19.939
Yes, all right,
fine, I've got it.

17:19.973 --> 17:21.807
I'm not the greatest
Marilyn.

17:21.825 --> 17:24.476
- Okay, Julia, step in.
- What?

17:24.493 --> 17:26.244
Step in.
Read for Marilyn.

17:26.279 --> 17:27.913
Where's Ivy?

17:27.948 --> 17:29.999
I just got a text.
She's stuck in the elevator.

17:30.033 --> 17:31.650
My God,
this wonderful building.

17:31.668 --> 17:33.669
Look, it's now or never.
Please.

17:41.145 --> 17:42.429
I'm not a joke.

17:42.463 --> 17:44.234
This relationship
is a joke.

17:47.468 --> 17:48.985
That's not the line.

17:49.020 --> 17:51.738
Well,
maybe it should be.

17:51.772 --> 17:53.823
Look, what do you
want out of me?

17:53.858 --> 17:56.142
What I want
is, uh, what's here.

17:56.160 --> 17:57.911
What's real between us,
and you keep lying.

17:57.945 --> 18:00.447
- I never lie.
- You lie every day.

18:00.481 --> 18:02.082
Every day is a lie
with you.

18:02.116 --> 18:04.751
You don't get to decide
how these things go.

18:04.785 --> 18:06.786
I am not yours
to order around.

18:06.820 --> 18:09.623
I'm not yours.

18:12.326 --> 18:14.177
Actually,
that's pretty good.

18:14.211 --> 18:15.462
Certainly bumps
into the song better.

18:15.496 --> 18:16.463
Did someone get that?

18:16.497 --> 18:18.599
Got it.

18:19.634 --> 18:21.501
Heat's still broken, right?
I need a little break.

18:21.519 --> 18:25.138
Well, stay off
the elevator.

18:25.172 --> 18:28.841
- Write that out for me.
- Okay.

18:32.563 --> 18:34.614
God.

18:37.635 --> 18:39.536
You know, early on
in my so-called career,

18:39.570 --> 18:42.789
I was working
on a new play.

18:42.823 --> 18:45.325
Promising young playwright,
lovely little theater.

18:46.544 --> 18:48.294
Then, one day,
we turned up,

18:48.329 --> 18:50.380
and the roof had caved in
'cause of a snowstorm.

18:51.766 --> 18:53.817
And the leading lady
got SARS.

18:54.986 --> 18:58.088
- Do you remember SARS?
- Yeah.

18:58.122 --> 19:02.276
And finally a divan
we had on set got bedbugs.

19:02.310 --> 19:04.511
Well, that's quite a story....

19:04.545 --> 19:08.949
My point, Eileen, is that
sometimes a project is cursed.

19:08.983 --> 19:13.937
Derek, this workshop
is gonna happen today,

19:13.972 --> 19:18.442
as scheduled,
and it's gonna be brilliant.

19:18.476 --> 19:20.360
Because the material
is brilliant,

19:20.395 --> 19:22.162
and the songs
are brilliant,

19:22.180 --> 19:25.015
and you're truly
a great enough director

19:25.049 --> 19:27.167
to justify your behavior.

19:27.201 --> 19:29.136
Is that supposed
to be flattery?

19:29.170 --> 19:32.522
You can take it
however you like.

19:32.557 --> 19:35.525
But we're gonna
make a hit out of this.

19:35.560 --> 19:37.811
Because Marilyn
deserves it.

19:37.845 --> 19:39.813
Who the hell is that
in my boiler room?

19:39.847 --> 19:41.181
I called a plumber.

19:41.199 --> 19:42.366
I want him out of here
immediately.

19:42.400 --> 19:44.701
Not before
the heat is fixed.

19:44.736 --> 19:45.702
Fine.
I'm calling the cops.

19:45.737 --> 19:47.654
Call the cops.

19:47.688 --> 19:49.873
And I'll call the Schuberts
and the Nederlanders.

19:49.907 --> 19:51.491
They all have studios here,

19:51.525 --> 19:53.960
and I'm sure they'll be
extremely interested

19:53.995 --> 19:56.847
to find out just how badly
this building is maintained.

19:56.881 --> 19:59.132
Anyone gets hurt,
it's on your head.

19:59.167 --> 20:02.552
No one's gonna get hurt.

20:02.587 --> 20:05.639
Wisely done.

20:05.673 --> 20:07.758
And we're back!

20:09.427 --> 20:11.561
Excuse me,
are you in the show?

20:11.596 --> 20:13.397
Yeah.

20:13.431 --> 20:16.316
Could you tell Tom Levitt
that John Goodwin's here?

20:16.351 --> 20:18.502
- Sure.
- Thanks.

20:20.271 --> 20:22.022
Uhoh.

20:22.056 --> 20:25.725
That's Joe Machota,
from CAA.

20:25.743 --> 20:27.227
Okay, so...

20:27.245 --> 20:29.229
So, he just happens
to represent

20:29.247 --> 20:30.497
about three
different stars

20:30.531 --> 20:32.699
who would be perfect
for Marilyn.

20:32.733 --> 20:34.167
Guys.

20:34.202 --> 20:36.403
You want
to maybe shut up?

20:36.421 --> 20:38.071
She can hear you.

20:39.740 --> 20:43.844
- Sorry.
- Sorry.

20:43.878 --> 20:46.181
Unbelievable.

20:48.216 --> 20:49.749
- You okay?
- I'm sorry, bro.

20:49.767 --> 20:51.584
Yeah.

20:51.602 --> 20:53.387
You'll be stunned to hear
that the ensemble's being

20:53.421 --> 20:55.755
a shred insensitive,
sort of loudly speculating

20:55.773 --> 20:57.524
right before
the performance

20:57.558 --> 20:59.943
that you're planning
on replacing Ivy with a star.

20:59.977 --> 21:01.278
- God.
- It's...

21:01.312 --> 21:03.763
- Tom?
- John.

21:05.433 --> 21:07.267
Yeah, so,
if you get a chance,

21:07.285 --> 21:09.936
she could use
some encouragement.

21:09.954 --> 21:12.122
Honey, hi.
Where's Leo?

21:12.156 --> 21:13.740
He's in high school
now, honey.

21:13.774 --> 21:15.909
He was gonna start skipping
things sooner or later.

21:15.943 --> 21:16.975
- Frank.
- Michael.

21:16.976 --> 21:18.462
How are you?
Good to see you again.

21:18.496 --> 21:20.380
Leo said that you
stopped by the house.

21:20.415 --> 21:21.598
You should come by when I'm
there... maybe dinner sometime.

21:21.632 --> 21:22.999
That sounds great.

21:25.619 --> 21:27.620
How ya feeling?

21:27.638 --> 21:29.756
Great. Great.

21:29.790 --> 21:31.591
Where's your boyfriend?

21:31.625 --> 21:34.594
He's not my boyfriend,
we're just seeing each other.

21:34.628 --> 21:37.981
He's over there,
by your... friend.

21:38.015 --> 21:39.399
His name is Sam,

21:39.434 --> 21:41.301
and what is
your problem with him?

21:41.319 --> 21:42.486
It's just...

21:42.520 --> 21:45.272
Okay.
He's too straight.

21:45.306 --> 21:47.824
I like straight people,
that's not the issue.

21:47.859 --> 21:51.278
But I just kissed John in front
of him, and he was all...

21:51.312 --> 21:52.913
You know how
some straight people get.

21:52.947 --> 21:54.331
He's just too straight.

21:54.365 --> 21:55.949
For crying out loud.
He's gay.

21:55.983 --> 21:57.751
Shut up.

21:57.785 --> 22:00.620
Tom, he's been my best friend
since I was 18 years old.

22:00.655 --> 22:03.340
He is gay, gay,
gay, gay, gay.

22:03.374 --> 22:04.341
He's gay?

22:04.375 --> 22:06.009
Where have you been?

22:06.043 --> 22:07.928
Where have you been?
Why didn't you tell me?

22:07.962 --> 22:09.662
Who knew your gaydar
was so stupid?

22:09.680 --> 22:12.466
My gaydar is not stupid.
I do not have stupid gaydar.

22:12.500 --> 22:13.683
I hate that word.

22:13.718 --> 22:15.519
I can't believe he's gay.

22:15.553 --> 22:18.004
What do you care?
You're seeing someone.

22:18.022 --> 22:19.806
And besides,
you can't stand him.

22:19.840 --> 22:20.941
That's right.

22:20.975 --> 22:23.693
- How are you?
- Okay.

22:23.728 --> 22:27.864
You can tell me anything.
You know that, right?

22:27.899 --> 22:31.017
My mother is doing everything
she can to undermine me.

22:31.035 --> 22:34.788
And Karen Cartwright is just
handed everything on a plate,

22:34.822 --> 22:37.290
and...

22:37.325 --> 22:38.992
I really don't
think I can do this.

22:39.026 --> 22:43.046
Ivy, listen to me.

22:43.080 --> 22:46.366
You were born to do this.

22:46.384 --> 22:49.719
You have ice water
in your veins.

22:55.543 --> 22:57.060
Thank you.

23:07.700 --> 23:08.800
- Bill.
- Hi.

23:08.814 --> 23:10.814
I'm so happy you could make it.

23:14.322 --> 23:16.258
Sorry.

23:16.429 --> 23:17.462
Is it completely
hopeless?

23:17.480 --> 23:19.431
He's still working.

23:19.465 --> 23:20.682
He says he's close, but you
got all these people here,

23:20.733 --> 23:22.434
so I'm sorry.

23:22.468 --> 23:25.237
Well, there's no need
to apologize.

23:25.271 --> 23:29.324
- Well, back to work.
- Nick...

23:29.359 --> 23:30.976
I'd like you
to stay and watch,

23:30.994 --> 23:33.662
if you want to, that is.

23:33.696 --> 23:36.665
- Sure.
- Yeah.

23:36.699 --> 23:39.084
Well, I should
maybe wash up a little.

23:39.118 --> 23:41.619
Yeah, the bathroom's
down the hall.

23:41.654 --> 23:43.956
I'll be right back.

23:50.263 --> 23:53.432
Ladies and gentlemen,
apologies for the delay.

23:53.466 --> 23:54.766
And the heat,

23:54.801 --> 23:57.352
which is currently
being attended to.

23:57.387 --> 24:00.505
Now, as many of you know,

24:00.523 --> 24:02.507
this is very much
a work in progress.

24:02.525 --> 24:05.477
We've focused primarily
on the Joe DiMaggio years,

24:05.511 --> 24:07.112
and the rest
of Marilyn's biography

24:07.146 --> 24:09.031
is covered very much
in sketch form.

24:09.065 --> 24:12.150
But what we have
is great.

24:12.184 --> 24:13.869
I think you'll agree.

24:13.903 --> 24:15.487
Please.

24:15.521 --> 24:19.091
Don't mind me.
I'm not here.

24:20.710 --> 24:22.544
Leigh Conroy,
ladies and gentlemen.

24:26.382 --> 24:27.365
Thank you.

24:27.383 --> 24:31.703
Thank you.

24:31.721 --> 24:33.472
Goodness, whew!

24:33.506 --> 24:35.474
Apparently,
some do like it hot.

24:35.508 --> 24:37.676
Indeed.

24:37.710 --> 24:40.512
And now, without further delay,
a brand-new musical

24:40.546 --> 24:42.965
about the life
of Marilyn Monroe,

24:42.999 --> 24:46.401
from the amazing
Houston and Levitt.

24:54.127 --> 24:58.563

I think I'm... I'm fine.

28:13.759 --> 28:16.228
And, uh,
that's intermission.

28:22.819 --> 28:24.569
Jules.

28:24.603 --> 28:26.705
- Not now. Please, Michael.
- We have to deal with this.

28:26.739 --> 28:29.791
There's nothing to deal with.
This is wrong, and you know it.

28:29.826 --> 28:31.609
- And it's over now.
- All right...

28:31.627 --> 28:32.911
Frank.

28:32.945 --> 28:35.613
Honey.
Great work up there.

28:35.631 --> 28:40.085
Thanks, sweetie.

28:40.119 --> 28:43.722
'Scuse me.

28:43.756 --> 28:45.257
Actors.

28:45.291 --> 28:49.060
- Ivy.
- Yeah.

28:49.095 --> 28:51.096
Okay, I'm talking to you
as your director now.

28:51.130 --> 28:54.432
Get your head in the game.
You are great in this.

28:54.466 --> 28:56.268
And you can do it
better than anyone,

28:56.302 --> 28:58.904
but I need you to focus.

28:58.938 --> 29:02.240
The show needs you
to focus, okay?

29:02.275 --> 29:04.776
Is that all?

29:04.811 --> 29:06.111
Yeah, that's it.

29:06.145 --> 29:07.745
Yeah.

29:11.117 --> 29:12.617
You do not talk
to an actor like that

29:12.651 --> 29:14.152
at intermission.

29:14.170 --> 29:16.988
Well, you do
if they're off their game.

29:17.006 --> 29:21.810
Jordan, hey!
Lovely to see you.

29:21.844 --> 29:25.163
- It's just publicity.
- It's dirty! It's filthy!

29:25.181 --> 29:27.132
They're turning you
into a joke!

29:27.166 --> 29:28.800
I am not a joke.

29:28.834 --> 29:30.635
This relationship
is a joke.

29:30.669 --> 29:32.521
Look, what do you
want from me?

29:32.555 --> 29:35.807
What I want is what's here.
What's real between us.

29:35.841 --> 29:37.008
You keep lying.

29:37.026 --> 29:40.979
I never lied.

29:41.013 --> 29:44.816
d Hurry, hurry,
step right up d

29:44.850 --> 29:48.770

30:11.710 --> 30:15.480
It is chaos down here
on 52nd and Lexington.

30:15.514 --> 30:19.985
Film star Marilyn Monroe
brings Hollywood to Manhattan

30:20.019 --> 30:23.989
as she films Billy Wilder's
<i>Seven year itch.</i>

30:24.023 --> 30:26.658
d Hurry,

Bye.

33:31.293 --> 33:34.512
- Congratulations.
- Thanks.

33:34.547 --> 33:35.764
How do you feel
about it?

33:35.798 --> 33:39.050
I feel great.

33:39.084 --> 33:40.751
The room
was a little hot.

33:40.770 --> 33:42.920
Will you excuse me
for a second?

33:48.727 --> 33:50.562
That was great,
guys, really.

33:50.596 --> 33:52.230
I couldn't be prouder.

33:52.264 --> 33:55.700
- I thought it was awesome.
- The heat boned us.

33:55.734 --> 33:56.901
- So boned us.
- So what if it was hot?

33:56.935 --> 33:58.286
The show was fantastic.

33:58.320 --> 34:00.271
Yeah, and then you
fell off the bleachers!

34:00.289 --> 34:02.874
I didn't mean to.

34:02.908 --> 34:04.409
But Ivy was incredible.

34:04.443 --> 34:06.244
I was just so... I don't know.
Overwhelmed.

34:06.278 --> 34:08.713
I don't know
about incredible.

34:08.746 --> 34:10.114
You guys know she's not
my favorite person,

34:10.132 --> 34:11.782
but she was great.

34:11.801 --> 34:13.301
You should've taken
that meeting with Raskin.

34:13.335 --> 34:15.453
- You had a meeting?
- Yes.

34:15.471 --> 34:17.088
And I skipped it to do <i>Marilyn.</i>
They think I'm crazy.

34:17.121 --> 34:18.306
Yeah.

34:18.340 --> 34:20.291
This was just
a workshop, Karen.

34:20.309 --> 34:23.228
Which didn't pay anything, which
probably won't go anywhere.

34:23.262 --> 34:25.647
I wouldn't have missed it
for the world.

34:27.349 --> 34:28.799
I wouldn't have
missed it for the world.

34:28.818 --> 34:30.902
I didn't say it
like that, actually.

34:30.936 --> 34:33.471
Thanks for coming.
Great to see you. Thanks.

34:33.489 --> 34:35.440
We need to rethink
some things.

34:35.474 --> 34:36.774
Not right now.

34:36.808 --> 34:40.978
Of course, but soon.

34:40.996 --> 34:42.831
I'm sorry
about the plumber.

34:42.864 --> 34:44.282
Don't be silly.

34:44.315 --> 34:46.150
This was great, though.
A lot of fun.

34:46.168 --> 34:47.619
Thanks for coming.

34:47.652 --> 34:51.322
Gonna have to
come to more of these.

34:51.340 --> 34:53.257
Who the hell is that?

34:53.292 --> 34:56.928
He makes the best
$7 Martinis in Manhattan.

34:56.962 --> 34:58.630
How nice for him.

35:03.519 --> 35:05.303
Bravo, darling.

35:05.337 --> 35:06.837
Than, mom.

35:06.856 --> 35:08.606
The songs are excellent,
and the direction,

35:08.641 --> 35:11.676
and who was that boy
that played Joe DiMaggio?

35:11.694 --> 35:12.843
He was terrific.

35:12.862 --> 35:16.648
I just loved
the whole thing.

35:16.682 --> 35:17.682
Well, what about me?

35:17.700 --> 35:19.517
Well...

35:19.535 --> 35:21.786
Forget it.
Just forget it.

35:21.820 --> 35:23.321
Ivy!

35:23.355 --> 35:25.039
Look, how am I
supposed to be anything

35:25.074 --> 35:28.960
when you're always here,
sucking up the light like a...

35:28.994 --> 35:31.546
- Like a black hole?
- Sweetheart...

35:31.580 --> 35:32.830
Don't even.

35:32.864 --> 35:35.550
You say something cruel
every day,

35:35.584 --> 35:38.386
when you're not
ignoring me.

35:38.420 --> 35:43.391
You're my mother, and you can't
even say one kind word.

35:43.425 --> 35:45.977
And you know who else
had a mother like that?

35:46.011 --> 35:49.015
Marilyn.

35:50.549 --> 35:52.016
Look how she turned out.

35:52.050 --> 35:54.905
She was a legend.

35:56.939 --> 36:00.525
She was an unhappy,
drug-addicted disaster.

36:00.559 --> 36:03.895
Because her mother
didn't love her.

36:03.929 --> 36:07.198
That's what Marilyn was.

36:24.899 --> 36:28.284
You coming up to the house
anytime soon?

36:28.319 --> 36:31.021
No, I'm not.

36:31.755 --> 36:34.707
Your father
will be disappointed.

36:34.742 --> 36:36.843
Jimmy too.

36:36.877 --> 36:41.881
Tell them I said hello.

36:44.919 --> 36:48.704
Ivy...

36:48.722 --> 36:51.374
It's hard for me
to watch you.

36:51.392 --> 36:53.643
I never wanted you
to do this.

36:53.677 --> 36:55.345
Yes, mom.
That's very clear.

36:55.379 --> 36:59.799
I know I haven't been
the greatest mother.

36:59.833 --> 37:02.735
I know that.

37:02.770 --> 37:05.321
But I know how heartbreaking
this world is.

37:05.356 --> 37:07.390
And I can't stand
to watch you

37:07.408 --> 37:10.476
go through everything
I went through.

37:10.511 --> 37:15.698
Even now, I wish you'd
find something else.

37:15.732 --> 37:20.703
Not because
you're not good at it.

37:20.737 --> 37:24.340
Because you're
my daughter.

37:27.077 --> 37:30.380
And I love you,
and for years,

37:30.414 --> 37:32.915
I've watched as people
without an ounce of your talent

37:32.950 --> 37:34.917
have passed you by.

37:34.935 --> 37:39.555
That's the theater.

37:39.589 --> 37:44.560
But your day will come,

37:44.595 --> 37:47.897
because there's
no question.

37:47.931 --> 37:52.785
You're a star.

38:22.683 --> 38:27.654
"Insiders indicated
it was in serious trouble.

38:27.688 --> 38:32.175
"One long-time producer
called it 'confused.'

38:32.209 --> 38:33.609
another came out
and said..."

38:33.643 --> 38:34.944
I don't want to know.

38:34.978 --> 38:36.829
Just step away
from the computer.

38:36.864 --> 38:40.867
Okay.

38:42.453 --> 38:44.454
So...

38:44.488 --> 38:46.339
Is it over?

38:46.373 --> 38:48.591
Don't be ridiculous.
We all know what we're doing.

38:48.625 --> 38:51.344
The show is great.
It was too hot.

38:51.378 --> 38:53.112
They're getting
a new boiler.

38:53.147 --> 38:55.131
They couldn't
have done that yesterday?

38:55.165 --> 38:58.267
Listen, we're gonna
have to regroup and repackage.

38:58.302 --> 39:00.937
Joe Machota
was there from CAA.

39:00.971 --> 39:02.805
He represents
Scarlett Johansson,

39:02.840 --> 39:04.640
Michelle Williams,
Sutton Foster.

39:04.675 --> 39:05.675
Stop.

39:05.709 --> 39:07.694
Come on,
Ivy was terrific.

39:07.728 --> 39:09.112
Not yesterday,
she wasn't.

39:09.146 --> 39:10.446
It didn't help
that you told her

39:10.481 --> 39:13.316
she was off her game
at intermission.

39:13.350 --> 39:14.600
You said that?

39:14.635 --> 39:16.102
Yeah, I did.
I was directing her.

39:16.136 --> 39:18.354
Look, Ivy's terrific,

39:18.372 --> 39:19.789
but she's been
in the ensemble for how long?

39:19.823 --> 39:21.190
Look, they turn down the wattage
to blend in.

39:21.225 --> 39:22.792
And they can't
turn it up again.

39:22.826 --> 39:25.278
Ivy was terrific under
impossible circumstances,

39:25.312 --> 39:26.279
and you didn't help.

39:26.313 --> 39:27.964
You know what I think?

39:27.998 --> 39:31.217
She humiliated you
in front of everyone,

39:31.251 --> 39:33.136
and so you sabotaged her.

39:33.170 --> 39:34.370
Okay, do you want
to fix the show,

39:34.388 --> 39:36.005
or indulge
in paranoid fantasies?

39:36.039 --> 39:37.857
I'm not paranoid.
This happens all the time.

39:37.891 --> 39:39.475
Things don't go well,

39:39.510 --> 39:41.811
and instead of
figuring out the problem,

39:41.845 --> 39:42.812
everyone picks a scapegoat
and then gangs up on them.

39:42.846 --> 39:44.213
That's all this is.

39:44.231 --> 39:46.733
Tom, Tom, Tom.
Nobody is scapegoating Ivy.

39:46.767 --> 39:48.484
She was excellent.

39:48.519 --> 39:51.020
Now, I was hoping we could
get some of these investors

39:51.054 --> 39:53.639
to come onboard on the strength
of the material.

39:53.674 --> 39:55.358
But we're gonna need
another piece.

39:55.392 --> 39:57.410
It was too hot....

39:57.444 --> 39:59.662
The heat didn't help.

40:00.696 --> 40:02.064
I...

40:02.082 --> 40:03.833
uh...

40:03.867 --> 40:05.918
I think the real problem
is Michael Swift.

40:05.953 --> 40:07.503
Tom.

40:07.538 --> 40:11.424
Are you daft?
He was sensational.

40:11.458 --> 40:14.343
Where are you
on this, Julia?

40:22.136 --> 40:24.253
Yes.

40:24.271 --> 40:27.039
- I think he should go.
- Eileen.

40:27.074 --> 40:31.060
I think Tom and Julia

40:31.094 --> 40:32.595
should make the call
on this one, Derek.

40:32.613 --> 40:34.347
There are other actors
out there.

40:34.381 --> 40:37.116
Yeah, okay.

40:49.963 --> 40:52.231
Where's your dad?

40:52.266 --> 40:54.801
Upstairs,
studying chemistry.

41:04.595 --> 41:08.581
- You hungry?
- No, we ate.

41:10.934 --> 41:13.402
So?

41:13.437 --> 41:16.441
What did people say
about <i>Marilyn?</i>

41:20.810 --> 41:23.846
They liked it.
There were some problems.

41:23.881 --> 41:28.000
There's always
a few problems.

41:28.035 --> 41:32.522
This time it was the heat.

41:32.556 --> 41:35.708
Yeah?

41:38.445 --> 41:40.379
We're firing Michael.

41:46.019 --> 41:47.670
You are?

41:47.688 --> 41:49.205
Yes.

41:49.239 --> 41:50.839
He wasn't right
for the part.

41:50.858 --> 41:54.510
- No,
- No.

41:54.528 --> 41:58.531
He wasn't right.

41:58.565 --> 42:00.149
So we're firing him.

42:07.157 --> 42:08.878
Good.
