00:24.796 --> 00:27.796
<- credit goes to the original subber ->

00:28.796 --> 00:30.762
Here's what we know.

00:31.099 --> 00:34.066
Gina DeSavio was working her usual shift

00:34.068 --> 00:39.705
in the Harrington Country Club dining
room on Friday, November 6th, 1998.

00:39.707 --> 00:42.775
She was a smart girl.
Not afraid of hard work.

00:42.777 --> 00:45.611
She had two jobs ever since
graduating high school,

00:45.613 --> 00:47.379
saving for college.

00:47.381 --> 00:50.182
She made good tips at the
Country Club on the weekend.

00:50.184 --> 00:53.352
I spoke to the bartender and
the club manager from that night.

00:53.354 --> 00:58.966
They estimated she must have cleared
$150 which she picked up before she left.

00:59.527 --> 01:01.860
Another waitress, Courtney Jeffers,

01:01.862 --> 01:05.399
said the next day that
Gina might have been upset.

01:05.433 --> 01:07.833
She hadn't really paid attention.

01:11.739 --> 01:15.207
Gina got in her car, a 1993 blue Neon,

01:15.209 --> 01:19.105
and the security guard said she raced
out of the parking lot without waving,

01:19.107 --> 01:21.180
which was unusual.

01:25.052 --> 01:29.054
It was the last time
Gina was ever seen alive.

01:29.924 --> 01:34.760
Gina's car was found smashed
into a boulder off Route 17

01:34.862 --> 01:38.030
near the edge of the national forest.

01:38.232 --> 01:41.033
There was blood found
on the windshield inside

01:41.035 --> 01:43.469
and it matched Gina's blood type.

01:43.471 --> 01:45.671
The next morning when she
didn't turn up at home,

01:45.673 --> 01:49.708
her mother called the
police and the search began.

01:49.710 --> 01:53.079
That search turned into a recovery.

01:53.481 --> 01:56.014
But there was no recovery.

01:57.885 --> 02:01.353
There was no body found,
there were no answers.

02:01.355 --> 02:04.823
What happened to Gina
DeSavio that night?

02:04.825 --> 02:07.159
How did she die?

02:07.161 --> 02:08.743
Why?

02:08.745 --> 02:13.165
I'm Alex McPherson and this
is season 2 of "Recovered".

02:20.742 --> 02:24.006
If you're listening to this, you
probably heard the first season,

02:24.011 --> 02:26.211
The Search for Amy Montoya.

02:26.213 --> 02:28.990
When my mother was sick, I
was at the hospital nonstop.

02:28.992 --> 02:31.216
That's where I met Mrs. Montoya.

02:31.218 --> 02:34.119
And after my mother
passed on, I had time.

02:34.121 --> 02:39.222
I'm not a detective, but before I quit to take
care of my mom, I'd been a business consultant.

02:39.227 --> 02:43.362
I'd take companies that were on the rocks,
and figure out how to make them float again.

02:43.364 --> 02:47.182
I am good at organizing chaos.
I learned as I went along.

02:47.184 --> 02:52.264
Listeners gave us some good tips and we
got lucky, Amy survived and came home.

02:52.269 --> 02:54.440
Now I want answers for Gina.

02:54.442 --> 02:55.708
So, here's the deal.

02:55.710 --> 02:58.977
I spent summers in Harrington,
Pennsylvania, growing up.

02:58.980 --> 03:01.128
I knew Gina DeSavio when we were kids.

03:01.130 --> 03:03.549
Right up through middle
school we were good friends.

03:03.551 --> 03:07.152
I haven't been back in... too long.

03:07.154 --> 03:10.689
But there's no way to
get justice for Gina

03:10.691 --> 03:12.958
without diving in again.

03:15.329 --> 03:18.731
Hi. It's Eileen Bruce
calling from The Chronicle.

03:19.033 --> 03:19.798
Thank you.

03:19.800 --> 03:22.210
- Hey, uh... Chuck.
- Yes, Chief?

03:22.217 --> 03:26.654
Yeah, these stats on imminent domain and accounting...
how'd you get them out of the hall of records?

03:26.707 --> 03:28.741
My wife's cousin Wanda made us a copy,

03:28.743 --> 03:31.148
- Which we will all deny.
- Okay.

03:31.150 --> 03:33.074
- Thanks.
- Yeah. You bet.

03:41.188 --> 03:42.487
Hi.

03:42.891 --> 03:45.257
Welcome to The Chronicle.
Are you here to place an ad?

03:45.259 --> 03:49.161
No, I'm here for some research
on a podcast I'm working on.

03:49.163 --> 03:50.829
I'm Alex McPherson.

03:50.831 --> 03:55.598
Oh, Chuck Matthews, senior press
manager and general assistant.

03:55.600 --> 03:58.392
- Sorry, it's not on.
- That's embarrassing.

03:58.405 --> 03:59.987
No... no worries.

03:59.989 --> 04:02.836
Um... it's nice to meet
you, Chuck. Press manager?

04:02.843 --> 04:06.636
Yeah, I keep the printing press running and I assist with
anything else they need around here. It's kind of cool.

04:06.638 --> 04:08.414
Well they say assistants run the world.

04:08.423 --> 04:11.576
So, how about it? Would you
mind if I use the archives?

04:11.585 --> 04:14.393
Sure. Wait... not my call.

04:14.417 --> 04:16.735
- Uh, hey Chief?
- I'm not Chief.

04:16.757 --> 04:19.935
He's the Editor in Chief but I call him
Chief. He loves it, it's kind of our thing.

04:19.959 --> 04:20.493
What is it?

04:20.495 --> 04:24.328
Miss McPherson here would like to take
a look at our archives for her podcast?

04:24.351 --> 04:27.263
- Hi, Miss McPherson?
- Call me Alex.

04:27.267 --> 04:31.668
Hi, uh, Drew Godfried.
So, what's this podcast?

04:31.671 --> 04:33.672
A cold case, Gina DeSavio.

04:33.674 --> 04:36.642
A local woman who went
missing 20 years ago from here.

04:36.644 --> 04:42.077
I'm having some trouble finding information
online, I thought the back issues would help a lot.

04:42.082 --> 04:45.655
- With what exactly?
- Facts. Context.

04:45.681 --> 04:49.025
Right, yes, that is what we do here. But
how is that going to help with your...

04:49.423 --> 04:51.256
I'm sorry, you're recording right now?

04:51.258 --> 04:53.425
I would never record
without your consent!

04:53.427 --> 04:55.048
Of course you wouldn't.

04:56.231 --> 04:57.963
Oh that's okay, he
doesn't like strangers.

04:57.965 --> 04:59.893
Oh, hi.

04:59.896 --> 05:01.833
What a good boy... girl?

05:01.835 --> 05:02.868
Uh, that's Hearst.

05:02.870 --> 05:06.358
That's funny, he normally doesn't
warm up that quickly to strangers.

05:06.362 --> 05:09.141
Aww, you seem like a sweetheart.

05:09.276 --> 05:11.043
Good boy.

05:11.045 --> 05:12.778
Is your publisher here?

05:12.780 --> 05:14.313
How do you know I'm not the publisher?

05:14.315 --> 05:15.814
Because you don't like Hearst.

05:15.816 --> 05:18.201
I love Hearst, actually
we're pretty tight. Here.

05:18.214 --> 05:19.518
Someone wants him here.

05:19.520 --> 05:22.454
And the masthead reads that
Miles Lewiston is the publisher.

05:22.456 --> 05:24.909
- He's out sick today.
- Sick?

05:24.911 --> 05:26.878
Can he be reached?

05:28.529 --> 05:30.061
Okay.

05:43.517 --> 05:45.444
Miles Lewiston.

05:45.446 --> 05:47.212
Hey, it's Drew. How you feeling?

05:47.214 --> 05:49.247
I'm hanging in. Place holding together?

05:49.250 --> 05:51.149
Yeah, no we're good. We're good.

05:51.151 --> 05:53.452
Listen, there's a woman here,

05:53.454 --> 05:58.327
says that she's doing a podcast about a local
cold case, wants to go through the archives.

05:58.331 --> 06:00.535
What podcast? Any credentials?

06:00.537 --> 06:02.399
I don't know. Do you need
any credentials for those?

06:02.404 --> 06:04.828
Her name's Alex McPherson. I
don't know anything about her.

06:04.832 --> 06:08.066
You say she's here.
What, she just showed up?

06:08.068 --> 06:11.770
Just in reception, casually
not watching me on the phone.

06:11.772 --> 06:14.373
Did she say anything else
about why she's in Harrington?

06:14.375 --> 06:16.141
No, just the podcast.

06:16.143 --> 06:17.709
So, it's a local case?

06:17.711 --> 06:20.724
Yeah. Some disappearance
from 20 years ago.

06:20.864 --> 06:22.915
That's got to be Gina DeSavio.

06:22.917 --> 06:25.018
- And you know it?
- I do.

06:25.023 --> 06:28.186
So will our readers.
This could be big for us.

06:28.189 --> 06:31.723
Give her a run of the archives,
help her if she needs it.

06:38.739 --> 06:41.905
You post your episodes on The
Chronicle website, exclusively.

06:41.909 --> 06:43.268
I already have arrangements.

06:43.270 --> 06:48.435
Three weeks exclusive and then you can
cast your pod wider. That's the deal.

06:48.609 --> 06:50.275
Done.

06:50.316 --> 06:52.544
How much do you hate this idea?

06:52.546 --> 06:54.913
Archives are at the end of the hall.

06:54.915 --> 06:57.074
- Thank you!
- Yep.

07:05.626 --> 07:09.565
Courtney Jeffers, Gina's
co-worker on her last known night,

07:09.568 --> 07:13.053
still lives in Harrington. She's
an attorney and tax accountant.

07:13.056 --> 07:16.383
I made an appointment to see he
but first I have another stop.

07:20.839 --> 07:23.107
- Mrs. DeSavio.
- Alex.

07:23.111 --> 07:25.643
What a nice surprise to hear from you.

07:27.147 --> 07:29.301
Please, come in.

07:31.085 --> 07:33.051
So, these are Angela's kids?

07:33.053 --> 07:36.596
Yeah, she's doing great.
They live in Pittsburgh.

07:36.599 --> 07:38.590
I can't believe Angela's
old enough to have kids.

07:38.592 --> 07:41.059
You know how people freeze
in time in your mind?

07:41.061 --> 07:43.804
I do... So, you were saying?

07:43.931 --> 07:48.734
So... Gina loved the
summers you were here.

07:48.736 --> 07:54.298
She would start counting down a month
out, marking big X's on the calendar.

07:56.377 --> 07:58.243
What?

08:00.347 --> 08:02.935
I was supposed to be here.

08:03.717 --> 08:07.686
I wanted to be here but
my dad, he got so sick.

08:07.688 --> 08:09.955
She understood.

08:09.957 --> 08:11.800
But maybe if I'd been here...

08:11.802 --> 08:14.669
What? You could've
stopped what happened?

08:14.760 --> 08:15.761
I know.

08:15.763 --> 08:17.696
I know that that sounds nutty.

08:17.698 --> 08:19.589
We've all thought it a thousand times.

08:19.591 --> 08:22.201
What could I do? How
could it be different?

08:22.503 --> 08:25.437
You couldn't have done
anything here, honey.

08:26.207 --> 08:28.573
But I can now.

08:28.575 --> 08:31.643
Podcasts, they make a
difference, you know.

08:31.645 --> 08:35.280
People come forward with new
information, with new clues.

08:35.282 --> 08:38.450
Don't you wonder what
happened that night?

08:38.452 --> 08:40.719
Every day.

08:41.989 --> 08:43.822
I'm going to grab you those things.

08:43.823 --> 08:46.024
They're in the garage.

08:46.043 --> 08:49.937
I kept Gina's room the same.
Have a look if you like.

09:54.295 --> 09:56.294
Here's Gina's keepsake box.

09:56.296 --> 09:58.997
Oh, did those fall down again?

09:59.099 --> 10:02.221
- I've got to glue those better.
- Okay.

10:02.936 --> 10:04.469
Is that Coleman House?

10:04.471 --> 10:07.906
Yeah, we took her there
for her 12th birthday.

10:09.016 --> 10:10.642
This is nice.

10:10.644 --> 10:13.233
I tried to make it of all
the things she would've loved.

10:13.235 --> 10:15.313
Here, you'll take care of these?

10:15.315 --> 10:16.748
Of course I will.

10:16.750 --> 10:18.852
Yes, and I'll bring them
back to you as soon as I can.

10:18.854 --> 10:21.786
So let me show you out.

10:24.324 --> 10:26.371
Okay, that's good. I appreciate that.

10:26.373 --> 10:28.393
Thanks. So, we can go to the
property after you've been there?

10:28.395 --> 10:29.594
Yeah sure, yeah.

10:29.596 --> 10:31.629
Hey, you going to come shoot
some pool Saturday, or... ?

10:31.631 --> 10:33.498
Yeah, Saturday sounds good.

10:35.936 --> 10:38.603
Yeah, I'll see you on Saturday.

10:38.605 --> 10:41.473
- Hi, Detective Patterson.
- Hi Detective, Alex McPherson.

10:41.475 --> 10:42.841
So, what can I do for you?

10:42.843 --> 10:45.911
Well, I'm just here to pick up
some paperwork. I called ahead.

10:45.913 --> 10:49.047
You have the Gina
DeSavio case file for me?

10:49.049 --> 10:50.749
Right, yeah.

10:50.751 --> 10:52.550
I saw that.

10:53.086 --> 10:56.185
Sad case. Barely a trace
of that girl ever found.

10:56.187 --> 10:57.088
You know it?

10:57.090 --> 10:59.361
- Oh yes, it was my rookie year.
- Really?

10:59.363 --> 11:03.026
I'm doing a podcast about this
case. I would love to interview you.

11:03.029 --> 11:05.981
Well, I'm not sure there's too much I could
offer that's not already in the file there.

11:05.983 --> 11:08.941
But, um... I mean, if you have any
questions I can try and do my best.

11:08.943 --> 11:10.268
Thank you!

11:10.270 --> 11:12.315
- I'll be in touch.
- Alright.

11:18.011 --> 11:20.145
You got a case file already?

11:20.147 --> 11:23.920
Well, I filed the Freedom of
Information Act request two weeks ago.

11:23.924 --> 11:26.637
Good thing it's a cold case otherwise
they wouldn't have released anything.

11:26.653 --> 11:28.320
What did you do when that happened?

11:28.322 --> 11:29.754
What do you mean?

11:29.756 --> 11:33.282
Well, you worked the crime beat
in Philly for 12 years. Right?

11:33.286 --> 11:35.260
I do research.

11:35.262 --> 11:38.263
Do you know how to read a case file?

11:38.465 --> 11:41.700
I mean, you know, if you need a hand.

11:41.902 --> 11:43.966
Did your boss tell you to help me?

11:43.968 --> 11:48.154
It was more like, let you have the run of the
archives but make sure you stay out of the way.

11:48.158 --> 11:50.097
- No, it wasn't.
- No...

11:50.099 --> 11:52.110
It wasn't. He told us that
we're supposed to help you.

11:52.112 --> 11:53.845
Any idea why?

11:53.847 --> 11:56.649
Well... I could use your insight.

11:56.650 --> 11:59.053
- If you don't mind.
- Sure.

11:59.056 --> 12:01.352
Maybe I could record your impressions?

12:01.354 --> 12:03.255
Hard pass.

12:03.357 --> 12:06.189
I'm going to the accident scene
tomorrow night, check it out.

12:06.191 --> 12:08.326
Okay, why not tonight?

12:08.328 --> 12:10.495
I have an important dinner date tonight.

12:10.497 --> 12:13.298
Okay, so why not tomorrow morning?

12:13.600 --> 12:16.167
I want to go at night. That's
when the accident happened,

12:16.169 --> 12:18.803
I want to see it the way that Gina did.

12:18.805 --> 12:20.939
You know, something
weird is going on here.

12:20.941 --> 12:22.908
You wouldn't believe
what I found out already.

12:22.910 --> 12:24.576
What?

12:25.145 --> 12:28.188
Tomorrow night. Nine o'clock?

12:31.118 --> 12:32.284
Okay.

12:32.286 --> 12:34.986
Well, thank you so much for
squeezing me in Courtney.

12:34.988 --> 12:36.867
Well, I have to say I was
surprised to get your call.

12:36.869 --> 12:40.258
It's been 20 years since
Gina DeSavio disappeared.

12:40.260 --> 12:41.826
I haven't thought about her in years.

12:41.828 --> 12:46.785
Well, it must've stuck with you. I mean, you were
interviewed by the police that night, weren't you?

12:46.788 --> 12:48.433
Uh, the next day.

12:48.435 --> 12:51.036
Gina and I weren't friends.
We worked together, that's all.

12:51.038 --> 12:55.540
You told the police that she was very
upset before she clocked out that night.

12:55.542 --> 12:57.609
If that's what I said.

12:57.611 --> 13:01.980
Well, I do have your statement
from the police report.

13:01.982 --> 13:04.449
If that helps jog your memory.

13:04.451 --> 13:06.985
It seems like it was
a really busy night.

13:06.987 --> 13:12.379
Sperling College had their homecoming
and there were three private events.

13:12.431 --> 13:16.536
Well, fridays were always
crazy. We worked as a team.

13:18.432 --> 13:21.766
I was taking orders and Gina
was running drinks from the bar.

13:21.768 --> 13:24.199
The old club manager mentioned that...

13:24.204 --> 13:26.972
there had been some sort of medical
emergency in the dining room?

13:26.974 --> 13:28.942
Oh yeah, there was.

13:33.347 --> 13:37.615
Courtney, if you could
try to remember anything.

13:53.767 --> 13:55.233
Courtney?

14:00.424 --> 14:03.541
Courtney, what did you remember?

14:07.080 --> 14:09.114
Err... It was a mess.

14:09.116 --> 14:11.850
That's all, just busy.

14:14.187 --> 14:18.650
We worked, Gina left and
I never saw her again.

14:18.792 --> 14:22.460
I really did squeeze you in so
I'm going to have to wrap up.

14:22.462 --> 14:25.984
Oh. Um... okay.

14:27.167 --> 14:30.735
Well, would you mind if I called
you to make another appointment

14:30.737 --> 14:33.173
- where you might have some time?
- Sure.

14:33.175 --> 14:35.201
Okay. Thank you.

14:47.454 --> 14:48.553
It's me.

14:48.555 --> 14:50.655
I just had an interesting meeting.

14:50.657 --> 14:53.854
I remembered something about
the day Gina DeSavio disappeared.

14:53.860 --> 14:55.894
I bet you know what it is.

14:55.896 --> 14:59.131
Well, if there's an
explanation I'd love to hear it.

14:59.533 --> 15:02.643
Tomorrow then. Be there.

15:13.346 --> 15:15.513
Dad, dinner in five.

15:16.883 --> 15:18.083
What's that?

15:18.085 --> 15:21.786
Just a file from Miss
McPherson's cold case.

15:21.788 --> 15:23.760
Why?

15:23.790 --> 15:26.091
Mr. Lewiston said to help any way we can

15:26.093 --> 15:30.595
and I want to keep my job so that I can
stay and teach and you can go to Sperling.

15:30.597 --> 15:34.532
I mean why is Miss McPherson
looking at that case?

15:34.534 --> 15:36.161
Oh. Good question.

15:36.163 --> 15:40.402
I don't know exactly why but I figured
that if I can help her maybe I can find out.

15:40.707 --> 15:43.241
I'll just be two more minutes.

15:43.243 --> 15:45.276
Sure, Dad.

15:48.348 --> 15:52.350
There's clearly an art, or at least
a skill, to reading a police report.

15:52.352 --> 15:55.653
But amidst all the
abbreviations and jargon

15:55.655 --> 15:58.089
one question seems clear.

15:58.091 --> 16:00.859
Yes, Gina was injured.

16:00.861 --> 16:02.994
But not severely.

16:02.996 --> 16:06.264
There wasn't that much blood in the car.

16:17.043 --> 16:18.768
Courtney.

16:19.780 --> 16:22.613
Courtney, what did you remember?

16:25.519 --> 16:27.552
It was a mess.

16:27.554 --> 16:30.421
That's all, just busy.

16:32.659 --> 16:36.828
Miles Lewiston is the only reason
this paper is still running.

16:36.830 --> 16:39.831
I mean, we only publish weekly as it is.

16:39.833 --> 16:43.234
How many days has he
actually been in this month?

16:43.236 --> 16:45.470
It's always been a family-run paper.

16:45.472 --> 16:47.906
- I mean, if he goes...
- He can't retire.

16:47.908 --> 16:50.308
This is my second Plan B.

16:50.310 --> 16:53.178
When the mill closed, I
was lucky to find anything.

16:53.180 --> 16:55.313
If The Chronicle didn't
run their own presses

16:55.315 --> 16:57.481
I'd already be out on the street.

17:00.720 --> 17:02.387
You'll find your own niche.

17:02.389 --> 17:05.857
Listen, I invented my own job.

17:05.858 --> 17:08.726
And now my columns are the most
widely read at The Chronicle

17:08.728 --> 17:10.762
and I drive the most web traffic.

17:10.763 --> 17:14.199
And my comment section sizzles.

17:14.201 --> 17:16.634
I don't know about sizzles but
she's not wrong about the rest.

17:16.636 --> 17:19.034
- Gossip...
- Local commentary.

17:19.039 --> 17:20.805
Sells.

17:21.374 --> 17:22.973
What you working on?

17:22.976 --> 17:28.242
I'm looking for hostels and SRO hotels
close to town that were in business in 1998.

17:28.248 --> 17:31.249
- What's an SRO hotel?
- Single Room Occupancy.

17:31.251 --> 17:33.818
They're like hotels but
residences for people

17:33.820 --> 17:36.487
with not a lot of money or
who don't want to be seen.

17:36.489 --> 17:39.090
Hey... do you want
a hand? I've got time.

17:39.092 --> 17:40.825
- Really?
- Yeah.

17:40.894 --> 17:43.578
Um... yeah! I mean it would
be great if you could check...

17:43.580 --> 17:45.797
How about a 100-mile radius from here?

17:45.799 --> 17:47.865
- Yeah!
- All right, I'm on it.

17:47.867 --> 17:49.534
Thank you.

17:52.272 --> 17:56.407
You know, your column is
the first thing I read too.

18:00.480 --> 18:02.849
- It is you!
- Katie!

18:03.717 --> 18:05.950
I was just coming to find
you, I heard you were back.

18:05.952 --> 18:08.825
- Look at you, you look great.
- I know, right?

18:08.827 --> 18:10.221
So do you!

18:10.223 --> 18:13.291
Did you ever get my little
comment on the Montoya podcast?

18:13.293 --> 18:15.360
I finally found it. You
know, you could email me.

18:15.362 --> 18:17.695
Well I wanted to leave you
a little surprise to find.

18:17.697 --> 18:19.197
I can't believe you
listen to my podcast.

18:19.199 --> 18:22.716
I listen to podcasts every
chance I get. I stumbled upon it.

18:22.769 --> 18:24.269
Are you still in criminal defence?

18:24.271 --> 18:27.105
I am in private practice now.
So I do whatever people need.

18:27.107 --> 18:30.001
- What brings you back?
- Gina DeSavio.

18:30.310 --> 18:32.217
Oh, Alex.

18:32.853 --> 18:35.046
I'll never forget that phone call.

18:35.048 --> 18:36.781
I can't believe I'm the
one who had to tell you.

18:36.783 --> 18:38.850
I didn't even know she was missing.

18:38.852 --> 18:41.352
I was no help then but I can
do something about it now.

18:41.354 --> 18:43.388
Is this going to be your next case?

18:43.390 --> 18:47.223
Next case, it sounds so strange,
like I have any idea what I'm doing.

18:47.225 --> 18:49.093
But... but, yeah.

18:49.095 --> 18:52.596
Katie, I'm going to find
out what happened to Gina.

19:30.971 --> 19:32.603
How'd your date go last night?

19:32.605 --> 19:34.339
Great. Just like old times.

19:34.341 --> 19:35.606
Good.

19:35.608 --> 19:37.909
So... this is it?

19:37.911 --> 19:39.477
Yeah.

19:39.479 --> 19:41.913
This is the rock.

19:41.915 --> 19:43.781
You want to play it out for me?

19:43.783 --> 19:45.283
Okay.

19:45.285 --> 19:50.354
Well, Gina was speeding down the road
and she skids off into these rocks.

19:50.356 --> 19:55.093
Except... as I saw
earlier, she doesn't skid.

19:55.495 --> 19:57.295
She didn't even try to stop?

19:57.297 --> 19:58.928
She was just...

19:58.933 --> 20:02.499
swerving off the road and crashed into
the rocks without even trying to break.

20:02.502 --> 20:06.471
She hits her head on the windshield, she
gets out and she heads off into the woods

20:06.473 --> 20:08.906
instead of back towards the road. Why?

20:08.908 --> 20:10.942
I don't know.

20:11.244 --> 20:13.578
Wasn't thinking straight?

20:13.580 --> 20:17.982
She left everything in the car. Her
purse, her wallet, her cell phone.

20:17.984 --> 20:19.550
But she had cash on her.

20:19.552 --> 20:22.820
The country club manager confirmed that
she'd gotten her tips before she left.

20:22.822 --> 20:24.982
Do you know for a fact she
didn't go to the bank first?

20:25.029 --> 20:27.692
She didn't have time. She
must've had that cash on her.

20:27.694 --> 20:29.527
You know what, more likely,

20:29.529 --> 20:33.397
someone helped themselves to the cash before the
cops did inventory, didn't think they would notice.

20:33.399 --> 20:35.606
Maybe in the big city but here?

20:37.103 --> 20:40.238
Okay. Gina headed off
into the woods., so...

20:40.240 --> 20:41.706
Careful.

20:41.708 --> 20:43.474
You used to live here, right?

20:43.476 --> 20:45.176
Well I spent my summers here.

20:45.178 --> 20:48.346
Why just summers? Where were
you the rest of the time?

20:48.348 --> 20:50.281
Is this an interview?

20:50.283 --> 20:52.984
Oh, just friendly
questions that people ask.

20:52.986 --> 20:55.686
But you're not people,
you're a reporter.

20:55.688 --> 20:58.423
I'm still technically human.

20:58.625 --> 21:03.259
So, do you think this about 200 yards from
the road? I'm not very good at distances.

21:03.263 --> 21:05.763
I'm not very good at forests.

21:05.865 --> 21:07.832
City boy?

21:08.334 --> 21:11.436
Is that a friendly
question or an interview?

21:11.438 --> 21:12.537
City boy.

21:12.539 --> 21:14.138
So, 200 yards?

21:14.140 --> 21:16.774
- I'm going with 200 yards, right.
- Yeah, probably.

21:16.776 --> 21:21.769
Right. So, this would be where they found
a scrap of her clothing under the brush.

21:25.831 --> 21:28.518
This is where the dogs lost her.

21:29.022 --> 21:31.556
This is treacherous.

21:31.858 --> 21:35.159
And she was injured,
didn't have a light.

21:35.161 --> 21:37.695
But it was a three-quarter
moon that night.

21:37.697 --> 21:40.965
Right. Clear and 19 degrees.

21:40.967 --> 21:43.601
I checked.

21:43.603 --> 21:45.536
Man, she would've been freezing.

21:45.538 --> 21:48.039
Especially if she was losing blood.

21:48.041 --> 21:50.541
And she went into that river.

22:00.453 --> 22:04.489
I get it now. You thought
that Gina could've survived.

22:04.958 --> 22:08.023
I still think that. It is possible.

22:08.128 --> 22:10.328
Okay. You're right.

22:10.330 --> 22:12.730
Let's just say it's possible
she survived, all right?

22:12.732 --> 22:14.851
But then what? She...

22:14.853 --> 22:20.214
walked off, left her sister and her
mother for 20 years, never returned. Why?

22:22.509 --> 22:24.575
I don't know.

22:29.616 --> 22:31.649
So what do you think you found?

22:31.651 --> 22:34.285
It's a postcard from
Coleman House in Rockbridge.

22:34.287 --> 22:38.523
And it was with a collage of a bunch
of Gina's things that her mom had.

22:38.525 --> 22:44.093
So? Her mom got a blank postcard
in November 1998 from 30 miles away.

22:44.097 --> 22:46.597
There was another one too
from Kentucky horse country.

22:46.599 --> 22:48.966
I didn't get a chance to
check out the postmark though.

22:49.068 --> 22:50.134
What did she say?

22:50.136 --> 22:52.503
Mrs. DeSavio? She said
she bought them herself

22:52.505 --> 22:54.205
because she thought
Gina would like them.

22:54.207 --> 22:55.906
But she doesn't know
that I saw the back.

22:55.908 --> 22:58.743
So, you think that this
is a signal from Gina?

22:58.745 --> 23:03.047
Who sends a blank postcard
with block lettering and why?

23:03.049 --> 23:04.749
Hmm.

23:07.887 --> 23:10.388
I gotta go, it's a bit
of a professional hazard.

23:10.390 --> 23:12.623
You don't have to come,
it's 1:30 in the morning.

23:12.625 --> 23:14.125
Uh, yeah.

23:14.127 --> 23:16.126
Let's go.

23:27.874 --> 23:30.241
Hey Sean, is everyone okay?

23:30.303 --> 23:32.109
Not the owner.

23:34.347 --> 23:36.046
Oh, wow.

23:36.749 --> 23:39.083
Do we know who the owner was?

23:39.085 --> 23:42.353
Says here the address belongs to...

23:42.555 --> 23:44.840
Courtney Jeffers.

23:45.795 --> 23:47.325
What?

23:47.327 --> 23:49.360
Did you know her?

23:49.362 --> 23:51.796
Yeah, I interviewed her yesterday.

23:51.798 --> 23:55.633
She was one of the last
people to see Gina alive.

23:59.772 --> 24:04.173
It's preliminary, but we think it
started with the heater in the bedroom.

24:04.210 --> 24:05.843
Was it just her in there by herself?

24:05.845 --> 24:08.045
I'm telling you it's not
as cut and dry as you think.

24:08.047 --> 24:10.196
Yeah, and I'm telling you
it doesn't start with you.

24:10.198 --> 24:12.099
There's a chain of command
and it starts with Barlow.

24:12.101 --> 24:14.719
- You can look forward to my investigation.
- Thank you.

24:14.721 --> 24:16.921
I heard it was an accident.

24:18.091 --> 24:21.115
Yeah. That's the Sheriff's assessment.

24:21.160 --> 24:23.051
But not yours?

24:23.663 --> 24:24.862
Have we met?

24:24.864 --> 24:29.100
Alex. You're not buying the small
heater fire, are you Captain?

24:29.202 --> 24:30.635
John.

24:30.637 --> 24:32.653
It's not that cold tonight.

24:32.685 --> 24:34.272
Not really, no.

24:34.274 --> 24:38.175
So, does the fire department do their
own investigation to rule out arson?

24:38.177 --> 24:39.777
Are you a reporter?

24:39.779 --> 24:41.112
No.

24:41.114 --> 24:43.514
Well, I mean, not really.

24:43.516 --> 24:46.049
Well if you ever wanted
to be one you've...

24:46.051 --> 24:48.486
you've got some good instincts.

24:48.488 --> 24:50.287
Thank you.

24:53.860 --> 24:56.662
I don't know. They're
saying it's an accident.

24:56.663 --> 24:58.596
Not everyone.

25:02.068 --> 25:05.936
What if opening up a cold
case leads to a new crime?

25:05.938 --> 25:08.605
I am in uncharted water.

25:09.008 --> 25:12.476
I'm going to have to stay out the way
of law enforcement and any investigation.

25:12.478 --> 25:16.523
But if Courtney was killed, it
feels like it's connected to Gina.

25:16.599 --> 25:18.649
Which gives me pause.

25:18.651 --> 25:21.919
I don't want to do harm but if
there is something wrong here...

25:21.921 --> 25:24.521
it needs to be brought to light.

25:25.792 --> 25:30.261
Okay, left the country club at 7:00 P.M.

25:30.263 --> 25:31.595
Good boy, Hearst.

25:31.597 --> 25:33.931
Kendall, can you update the
post on the Jeffers fire?

25:33.933 --> 25:37.199
We just got a quote from Sean Mullen from
the fire department about the investigation.

25:37.201 --> 25:38.896
Me, myself?

25:38.898 --> 25:41.471
Yeah, it'll be easy.
I emailed you a copy.

25:41.477 --> 25:43.073
- Okay.
- Okay.

25:43.110 --> 25:45.676
So, if you would just hear my
theory about Courtney's death.

25:45.678 --> 25:49.233
Okay, we are a newspaper. We
deal in facts not speculation.

25:49.248 --> 25:50.515
- Facts.
- Yes.

25:50.517 --> 25:53.417
Well let's make sure we get
our facts correct then, huh?

25:53.419 --> 25:58.022
Gina left the country
club at 7:30, not 7:00.

25:58.224 --> 25:59.924
See, I care about facts.

25:59.926 --> 26:01.392
Mmm-hmm. Until you don't.

26:01.394 --> 26:04.195
But for now, what we know
is that Courtney Jeffers died

26:04.197 --> 26:07.264
in an accident and Gina
DeSavio died 20 years ago.

26:07.266 --> 26:08.895
You don't believe that.

26:08.897 --> 26:11.102
I mean, not half of that. Right?

26:11.104 --> 26:13.889
Do your facts tell you exactly
what time Courtney died?

26:13.891 --> 26:15.906
No, because we're waiting on an autopsy.

26:15.908 --> 26:20.956
But we do know that the neighbour called the fire
department at 1:15, they showed up 10 minutes later.

26:20.958 --> 26:24.432
The fire was out by 1:40,
the body was preserved.

26:24.434 --> 26:27.184
Isn't' that an awfully short
period of time for someone to die?

26:27.186 --> 26:29.319
Stranger things have happened.

26:31.357 --> 26:32.363
What?

26:32.365 --> 26:34.625
Hey! That's a fact. What are you doing?

26:34.627 --> 26:38.358
Well we don't know that it's relevant. What
happened after that, that's what matters.

26:42.802 --> 26:45.069
Where you going? We're
just getting started.

26:46.973 --> 26:49.306
Well I know it's just a
sweater but it is my favourite

26:49.308 --> 26:51.542
and Courtney called me,
told me to come pick it up.

26:51.544 --> 26:54.578
I can't believe that was
the last time I spoke to her.

26:54.580 --> 26:57.648
Yeah, well do you
remember where you left it?

26:57.650 --> 26:59.817
Yeah, I left it right here on my chair

26:59.819 --> 27:03.219
but she must have put it away
somewhere. So, I'll have to...

27:03.322 --> 27:05.223
Hey, Nate.

27:05.425 --> 27:07.458
I bet you'll have a busy day today, huh?

27:07.460 --> 27:09.960
Yeah. It's a shame about Miss Jeffers.

27:09.962 --> 27:11.228
She was a nice lady.

27:11.230 --> 27:13.263
Listen, do you mind if
I get a quote from you?

27:13.265 --> 27:16.563
We're actually doing a background
story on Miss Jeffers. It'd be great.

27:16.569 --> 27:17.802
Yeah.

27:18.239 --> 27:20.838
Oh, uh... I've got to get that.

27:20.840 --> 27:22.239
Uh, Miss?

27:22.241 --> 27:24.569
You go ahead. I'll stay
here until you get back.

27:24.577 --> 27:25.864
Okay.

27:27.013 --> 27:28.512
What are you doing?

27:28.514 --> 27:30.714
Me? What, are you following me?

27:30.716 --> 27:33.049
A thank you might be nice. Do
you know how lucky you just got?

27:33.051 --> 27:34.426
Lucky?

27:35.421 --> 27:36.554
Oh, that's good.

27:36.556 --> 27:37.755
We don't have much time.

27:37.757 --> 27:39.423
Okay. What exactly are
we looking for then?

27:39.425 --> 27:43.313
I'll know it when I see it.
She has a paper calendar.

27:44.504 --> 27:47.524
Wow. A Phillipe Delmaine pen.

27:47.567 --> 27:49.704
It's very high dollar.

27:50.269 --> 27:53.170
She has a standing
appointment on Thursdays.

27:53.172 --> 27:55.673
314 Hugginn?

27:55.675 --> 27:58.242
Hugginn. I don't recognize that name.

27:58.244 --> 28:01.214
Oh, get photos of this, get photos
of this. This looks like, uh...

28:01.216 --> 28:04.928
I don't know, like a billing log
for companies or something like that.

28:04.950 --> 28:09.216
- This guy, Russell. I know that name.
- Uh... found it!

28:10.756 --> 28:12.256
Look at that.

28:12.258 --> 28:15.086
Just over behind her
desk. Thank you so much.

28:15.091 --> 28:16.752
- No problem.
- Thanks.

28:16.762 --> 28:18.262
Thank you.

28:18.464 --> 28:20.855
Chuck. Did you have any
luck with those hostels?

28:20.858 --> 28:22.632
Hey. Yeah, yeah, there were only two.

28:22.635 --> 28:24.034
Those are on the yellow card.

28:24.036 --> 28:27.503
And the blue cards are campgrounds, which I
thought might be a place you'd go if you were broke.

28:27.506 --> 28:30.073
You know we're not really an
SRO flop-house kind of locale.

28:30.075 --> 28:31.208
No, I suppose not.

28:31.210 --> 28:33.911
But in 1998 there was a bus
to Pittsburgh from Raleigh

28:33.913 --> 28:36.546
that ran four times a
day starting at 5:00 A.M.

28:36.548 --> 28:38.015
You're a researcher!

28:38.017 --> 28:39.850
Uh... more like lapsed steel worker.

28:39.852 --> 28:43.954
Next career still TBD. But in
1998 I was a complete delinquent

28:43.956 --> 28:46.845
and I used that Rockbridge bus
to get to the city all the time.

28:46.847 --> 28:48.984
- That's over the river?
- Yeah, that's right.

28:48.995 --> 28:53.996
And the white cards are hostels and SROs
in Pittsburgh that were there in 1998.

28:53.999 --> 28:55.932
You up for a road trip later?

28:56.135 --> 28:57.920
- I'll check with Drew.
- You should check with Drew.

28:57.937 --> 28:59.316
- Yeah.
- Okay.

29:01.704 --> 29:04.708
- So, Courtney Jeffers worked for you?
- Yes.

29:04.710 --> 29:07.058
Did she work for you
or the adventure park?

29:07.060 --> 29:07.945
Hi.

29:07.947 --> 29:11.626
Hi. I'm Alex McPherson.
I work with Drew.

29:11.650 --> 29:13.067
Bradley Williford.

29:13.069 --> 29:15.252
Yeah, you're with
Riverview Adventure Park?

29:15.254 --> 29:16.387
That's us.

29:16.389 --> 29:19.690
My friends and I used to go
there all the time in the summers.

29:19.692 --> 29:22.726
- What was your favourite ride?
- White Water Challenge.

29:22.728 --> 29:26.127
I'm impressed. That's pretty hard-core!

29:27.066 --> 29:31.762
So... Courtney Jeffers, did she
work for you or the adventure park?

29:31.764 --> 29:34.104
Uh, she did my tax planning.

29:34.106 --> 29:36.707
But you want a quote
for your profile, right?

29:36.709 --> 29:39.293
Courtney was a skilled
professional and tireless worker.

29:39.295 --> 29:41.078
She'll be hard to replace.

29:41.080 --> 29:43.948
And how long did you know her for?

29:43.950 --> 29:46.550
She started five years ago.

29:46.552 --> 29:49.853
You know, I'm sorry I
have a meeting to get to.

29:49.855 --> 29:51.955
You can try me later next week.

29:51.957 --> 29:54.791
- Thank you, I appreciate it.
- Bye.

29:57.997 --> 29:59.104
Look...

29:59.106 --> 30:04.001
That... that's the kind of juicy details
you're going for with Courtney's client list?

30:04.003 --> 30:06.609
- You've got to get people talking.
- At the right time, yes.

30:06.612 --> 30:09.139
And those boring details,
those paint a bigger picture

30:09.141 --> 30:10.574
and you don't know what's
going to be important.

30:10.576 --> 30:12.476
If Courtney was killed
because of her job.

30:12.478 --> 30:17.196
If Courtney was killed at all and if so
it's because of money, not your theory.

30:17.198 --> 30:19.583
If she was killed, and
it wasn't because of Gina,

30:19.585 --> 30:21.885
the chances are it was
because of something personal.

30:21.887 --> 30:26.304
When a woman turns up dead, the killer's
usually the man who loved her too much.

30:26.308 --> 30:29.026
So, we have to find out about
Courtney's personal life.

30:29.028 --> 30:33.573
You know, like does she have a boyfriend,
an ex-boyfriend, who does she live with?

30:34.299 --> 30:35.733
What?

30:35.735 --> 30:39.136
Uh... you're right.

30:39.138 --> 30:41.438
Take deep breaths.
It won't hurt so much.

30:41.440 --> 30:44.008
Is there a reason that you
interrupted my interview?

30:44.010 --> 30:47.644
Oh, yes. I was hoping Chuck could come
with me to Pittsburgh, do some digging.

30:47.646 --> 30:50.981
Sure. We don't go to print for a
couple of days. So, if he wants to.

30:50.983 --> 30:53.016
What do you mean? Of course he wants to!

30:53.018 --> 30:55.786
And FYI, if you're going to be
digging in the city, just so you know,

30:55.789 --> 30:59.530
The Chronicle's agreement with
you does not include bail money.

30:59.532 --> 31:01.759
I'll keep that in mind.

31:01.861 --> 31:04.933
Hey, there's Stan
Russell. Hey Stan, wait up.

31:05.898 --> 31:08.765
May I have two cups of
coffee to go, please?

31:09.535 --> 31:12.373
Yeah, it's a shame about Courtney.

31:12.375 --> 31:14.738
So, you worked with her a long time?

31:14.740 --> 31:16.240
I had, yeah.

31:16.242 --> 31:20.344
Would you say she was good at her job?

31:20.346 --> 31:22.079
No complaints.

31:24.583 --> 31:25.616
All right.

31:25.618 --> 31:28.151
I got to get back to the hardware store.

31:29.055 --> 31:31.355
Did you know Courtney Jeffers?

31:31.357 --> 31:34.289
So sad. I liked her, she did my taxes.

31:34.293 --> 31:35.759
Was she good at it?

31:35.761 --> 31:39.630
Did right by me, but she
was distracted lately.

31:39.632 --> 31:41.765
Any idea why?

31:41.767 --> 31:45.535
All she'd say is men should
be a four-letter word.

31:53.305 --> 31:54.211
Hey!

31:54.213 --> 31:56.246
You stop poking around
in Courtney's business.

31:56.248 --> 31:59.483
You leave it alone
before somebody gets hurt.

32:05.458 --> 32:07.791
Well, the day wasn't a total waste.

32:07.793 --> 32:10.327
At least you got to see the
colourful side of Pittsburgh.

32:10.329 --> 32:13.764
Oh, yeah, every street and alley.
Thank you for your help, Chuck.

32:13.766 --> 32:16.332
I'm buying tonight. Pie is on me!

32:16.636 --> 32:18.568
Sorry we didn't come up with anything.

32:18.570 --> 32:20.611
Yeah. It was a long shot.

32:20.613 --> 32:23.341
I mean to think that someone from 1998

32:23.343 --> 32:27.851
would still be working in the same place and
remember seeing a young woman who stayed there.

32:27.853 --> 32:30.513
- If she even did.
- Yeah.

32:30.516 --> 32:32.650
Well we'll keep at it.

32:32.752 --> 32:33.884
[message alert]

32:33.886 --> 32:34.985
Okay.

32:34.987 --> 32:37.354
- What pie am I going to have?
- Oh good, nice!

32:37.356 --> 32:39.957
Kendall got Hearst home to
Mr. Lewiston safe in one piece.

32:39.959 --> 32:43.427
So, Hearst goes to work
even if his owner doesn't?

32:43.429 --> 32:45.295
Oh yeah, he missed the action.

32:45.297 --> 32:48.999
And Mr. Lewiston says that he keeps
an eye on things, which he does.

32:49.001 --> 32:51.401
Does Mr. Lewiston miss
a lot of days of work?

32:51.403 --> 32:52.803
Well it depends.

32:52.805 --> 32:55.837
But the truth? I think he's bored.

32:55.838 --> 32:59.872
Like he needs, well,
something. I mean something new.

33:02.675 --> 33:07.284
Most of the time when someone disappears
and no body is found it's deliberate.

33:07.286 --> 33:11.121
If Gina died and it was an
accident, how can there be no trace?

33:11.123 --> 33:12.756
And if she did survive,

33:12.758 --> 33:16.660
how could that possibly have happened.
Where could she have gone and why?

33:16.662 --> 33:20.998
We'll explore all of those questions,
especially the possibility of foul play

33:21.000 --> 33:23.800
and some surprising
discoveries I've made.

33:23.802 --> 33:26.770
On the next episode of "Recovered".

33:38.484 --> 33:41.819
Err... It was a mess,
that's all, just busy.

33:41.821 --> 33:44.288
Did you hear that?

33:44.490 --> 33:47.825
Uh... I'm not sure
what you think is there.

33:47.927 --> 33:49.593
Courtney was rattled.

33:49.595 --> 33:51.528
She obviously remembered something big

33:51.530 --> 33:53.864
about what happened the
night that Gina disappeared.

33:53.866 --> 33:56.733
She was just sitting there and then
she looks like she's seen a ghost...

33:56.735 --> 33:59.469
and then she tells me she doesn't
have enough time to talk to me.

33:59.471 --> 34:01.838
She hustles me out the door
and the next night she's dead.

34:01.840 --> 34:03.774
I just think that's
too big a coincidence.

34:03.776 --> 34:06.812
Miss McPherson, coincidences
happen all the time in real life.

34:06.814 --> 34:09.079
I believe the cases are connected.

34:09.081 --> 34:11.782
Captain Mullen from the fire
department suspects arson.

34:11.784 --> 34:14.177
Well if that's in his report
then we'll look into it

34:14.179 --> 34:18.217
but as of right now we just don't
have a crime here. In either case.

34:25.598 --> 34:29.266
Kendall, get the community calendar
to Eileen and send me her feature.

34:29.268 --> 34:32.350
- We're going to post in an hour.
- Okay, got it.

34:32.504 --> 34:35.804
- How was Pittsburgh?
- Total bust.

34:35.808 --> 34:38.876
There is a reason they
call them cold cases.

34:38.878 --> 34:41.277
Okay, well I have the
podcast too, Kendall.

34:41.280 --> 34:44.081
She's finishing the web page,
she's going to get it loaded up

34:44.083 --> 34:47.351
and I think that ought
to warm things up.

34:47.353 --> 34:50.047
Listen, has it occurred to you
that if Courtney was murdered

34:50.049 --> 34:53.090
this could be dangerous and somebody out
there is not going to be very happy with you?

34:53.092 --> 34:55.893
Maybe it'll just flush
them out. I'll be careful.

34:55.895 --> 34:57.294
Good.

34:57.963 --> 34:59.296
That you and Gina?

34:59.298 --> 35:01.732
Yeah. Her mom gave me
this picture. We were 10.

35:01.734 --> 35:04.434
Gina loved horses so much.

35:04.436 --> 35:06.536
She could only catch
ride but she didn't care.

35:06.538 --> 35:10.400
She would muck out a stall all day
just to earn one hour on a horse.

35:12.344 --> 35:16.279
Up Stan Russell, his family
used to own land around here.

35:16.281 --> 35:19.483
Russell? Yeah. The Russell
Estates, I knew that family.

35:19.485 --> 35:21.451
- Really? - They had
riding stables. - Oh.

35:21.521 --> 35:25.387
Well now he owns a couple of hardware stores. But
he told me that he was happy with Courtney's work.

35:25.391 --> 35:28.892
This says he hasn't paid his taxes.
He hasn't even filed in a long time.

35:28.894 --> 35:31.128
I mean, he must have all
his money laying around.

35:31.130 --> 35:33.463
Did he not notice that he
wasn't paying his taxes?

35:33.465 --> 35:37.032
I don't know, but the penalties are going to cost
him, from what I can tell, at least one of his stores.

35:37.036 --> 35:39.169
So why would he say he
was happy with her work?

35:39.171 --> 35:42.021
So, you're still going with money
as a motive for Courtney's murder?

35:42.024 --> 35:45.831
Yeah, check this out. I was
poking around at the hospital

35:45.833 --> 35:48.845
and found that the emergency
contact for Courtney was...

35:48.847 --> 35:50.446
- Troy Hines.
- Troy Hines, yeah.

35:50.482 --> 35:52.316
That sounds familiar. Is it a relative?

35:52.318 --> 35:53.950
Says right there, other.

35:53.952 --> 35:56.915
- Oh, as in significant.
- As in probably.

35:57.089 --> 35:59.715
- Oh, let's go.
- Let's go.

36:08.567 --> 36:10.434
Oh, you want to spook the guy?

36:10.436 --> 36:12.577
I'll be really relaxed about it, okay?

36:12.579 --> 36:15.739
But, you know, reporters record
interviews all the time, don't they?

36:15.741 --> 36:18.475
You're doing a memorial
profile, I'm your assistant.

36:18.477 --> 36:19.943
Oh, go on.

36:19.945 --> 36:23.694
I'm just your assistant for
this, okay? Just for today.

36:25.517 --> 36:26.783
Troy.

36:26.785 --> 36:27.818
Hey.

36:27.820 --> 36:29.619
Drew, Harrington Chronicle.

36:29.621 --> 36:31.421
Were you Courtney's boyfriend?

36:31.423 --> 36:32.689
I got nothing to say to you.

36:32.691 --> 36:34.041
We just wanted some impressions.

36:34.043 --> 36:36.795
I want to know why I'm going to be sorry
for asking questions about Courtney.

36:36.797 --> 36:38.462
What?

36:38.464 --> 36:40.831
Let's take this out back.

36:42.902 --> 36:44.404
Are you trying to get me fired?

36:44.406 --> 36:48.572
That'll be the least of your problems
if you threaten Miss McPherson again.

36:48.574 --> 36:50.407
I just said stop poking around.

36:50.409 --> 36:54.111
Look... Courtney and I were
together. We broke up a while ago.

36:54.113 --> 36:56.546
I'm putting things together for
myself now, we both moved on.

36:56.548 --> 36:58.048
So, there was a new guy?

36:58.050 --> 37:01.818
And I got a new girl who doesn't need you
embarrassing her with stupid questions about me.

37:01.820 --> 37:03.663
Okay. What's the name of the new guy?

37:03.665 --> 37:06.156
I don't know. Some
guy with a lot of cash.

37:06.158 --> 37:08.555
Look, you want to hassle
somebody? Find him.

37:08.557 --> 37:11.295
I hadn't even seen Courtney in months.

37:11.997 --> 37:14.264
I've got to get back to work.

37:19.371 --> 37:21.171
Hey, you ever hear of burying the lead?

37:21.173 --> 37:23.207
He threatened you?
That's useful information.

37:23.209 --> 37:24.808
I was going to tell you.

37:24.810 --> 37:27.777
But now, Troy has definitely
jumped to the top of my list.

37:27.779 --> 37:29.813
- Nah, I don't think so.
- What?

37:29.815 --> 37:31.114
You saw how mad he was.

37:31.116 --> 37:34.468
He was punching above his weight. I mean
if Courtney starts dating another guy,

37:34.470 --> 37:36.503
he's ticked off but he gets it.

37:36.505 --> 37:39.790
What if there isn't another guy? What
if Courtney got rich all on her own?

37:39.792 --> 37:42.292
We need to find the
name of that boyfriend.

37:42.294 --> 37:44.360
If there was one.

37:44.797 --> 37:47.131
Troy Hines?

37:47.633 --> 37:51.101
Well he's worked at the
country club most of his life.

37:51.203 --> 37:55.572
See I always suspected that
Courtney had someone else.

37:55.574 --> 37:57.040
Besides who?

37:57.042 --> 38:01.144
Besides the socially acceptable choice.

38:01.146 --> 38:03.880
See he always felt
like a stand-in to me.

38:03.882 --> 38:06.016
No way she could take
Troy to the founder's ball.

38:06.018 --> 38:08.285
- Any chance they were a couple?
- Does he have any money?

38:08.287 --> 38:09.719
Uh, no and no.

38:09.721 --> 38:14.658
He had a really tiny little law practice.
That's why he moved to Philadelphia last year.

38:14.660 --> 38:17.427
But, um... I'll see what I can find out.

38:17.429 --> 38:19.429
Great. Good job.

38:19.431 --> 38:22.876
Production meeting, 15
minutes. Give me all your copy.

38:27.673 --> 38:29.389
Hey Sean.

38:30.995 --> 38:33.243
My investigation into
the Jeffers' house.

38:33.245 --> 38:35.545
I found a pour pattern in the bedroom

38:35.547 --> 38:37.581
and the floor tested
positive for accelerant.

38:37.583 --> 38:40.148
- And you filed your report?
- I did.

38:40.152 --> 38:41.551
With all due respect,

38:41.553 --> 38:43.820
I don't think your boss
wants to open the case.

38:43.822 --> 38:45.789
This was no accident.

38:45.791 --> 38:48.291
He said if I found any evidence
of arson to come to you.

38:48.293 --> 38:49.926
Yeah, you're right. Okay.

38:49.929 --> 38:52.962
Uh... leave this with me and I
will push it through with Barlow.

38:52.964 --> 38:53.970
Great.

38:53.972 --> 38:56.665
- Great. Thank you.
- Yeah.

38:56.835 --> 39:00.437
Troy Hines was working at the country
club the night that Gina disappeared.

39:00.439 --> 39:02.906
Look at that! He was
interviewed by the police

39:02.908 --> 39:06.810
which means he is tied to both women.

39:06.912 --> 39:09.446
Okay. Put him up in the middle.

39:09.648 --> 39:11.481
Good idea.

39:11.483 --> 39:13.132
- Ten minutes!
- Ugh.

39:13.135 --> 39:14.317
Ten minutes everyone!

39:14.319 --> 39:17.303
Hearst, let's ask Katie
to meet us for coffee.

39:22.728 --> 39:25.362
I can't stop thinking about Gina now.

39:25.364 --> 39:27.998
Memories just keep flooding in.

39:28.000 --> 39:30.600
Hey, would you want
to record one for me?

39:30.602 --> 39:31.768
Sure.

39:31.770 --> 39:33.954
Um... mid-term break.

39:33.956 --> 39:38.325
I came home from school and the family went
to Arturo's for dinner and Gina waited on us.

39:38.327 --> 39:40.544
It was her second job.

39:40.546 --> 39:44.080
It always felt weird to me, but
she always made it feel comfortable.

39:44.082 --> 39:47.684
You know? Like she didn't mind how
hard she had to work for everything.

39:47.686 --> 39:50.020
She had goals.

39:50.222 --> 39:54.088
And that laugh. Do
you remember her laugh?

39:54.526 --> 39:59.360
She never let anything stop
her. Gina was pure potential.

39:59.464 --> 40:03.667
How does someone like that die
before realizing her dreams?

40:03.669 --> 40:06.596
You're right. It's so wrong.

40:08.040 --> 40:11.140
Gina would never let
things get her down for...

40:13.679 --> 40:15.111
I have to go.

40:15.113 --> 40:16.713
Hearst!

40:16.715 --> 40:19.548
Katie, I'll be in touch! Bye!

40:21.753 --> 40:23.920
- Hey. Chuck?
- Hey, here.

40:23.922 --> 40:26.423
Oh! I've been going at this all wrong.

40:26.425 --> 40:28.091
I mean what if Gina survived?

40:28.093 --> 40:31.928
Even if she was broke and had to live in
hostels, that would not be her whole story.

40:31.930 --> 40:33.863
Not this girl. She would find a way.

40:33.865 --> 40:36.069
So, what if... Hey, stay with me.

40:36.073 --> 40:38.765
Look, I'm just saying what if she
didn't just settle for half a life?

40:38.770 --> 40:40.737
What if she went after her dream?

40:40.739 --> 40:43.840
What if we could finish
our meeting in peace?

40:43.942 --> 40:48.812
Miles Lewiston, this is our
podcaster Alex McPherson.

40:49.014 --> 40:50.947
Really? Still?

40:50.949 --> 40:53.016
Hi, Uncle Miles.

40:53.218 --> 40:54.684
Uncle?

40:54.686 --> 40:56.886
Everybody, my niece.

41:06.999 --> 41:08.765
You think these two are connected?

41:08.767 --> 41:10.200
- No.
- Yes.

41:10.202 --> 41:11.568
Not necessarily.

41:11.570 --> 41:14.838
If it's not about the DeSavio girl,
any idea on motive on Courtney?

41:14.840 --> 41:16.740
- Greed.
- Jealousy.

41:16.742 --> 41:17.974
Ah-ha.

41:17.976 --> 41:21.583
Well Uncle Miles, you should
know some of these guys, right?

41:22.280 --> 41:23.804
Yeah.

41:24.616 --> 41:27.650
Well, you can rule out Ted Peters.

41:27.652 --> 41:31.354
Stan Russell is treading
water financially, I hear.

41:31.356 --> 41:35.725
Never should've sold the farm and the
stables. Retail's hard business these days.

41:35.727 --> 41:37.694
Brad Williford...

41:37.696 --> 41:39.629
I knew his father better.

41:39.631 --> 41:42.982
The old man was hard on Bradley,
nothing the kid could do was good enough.

41:42.984 --> 41:45.302
But when he took over,
he was in a hurry.

41:45.304 --> 41:47.003
Expanded the business.

41:47.005 --> 41:51.709
You see, now he stuck
around town and made it work.

41:52.208 --> 41:54.911
Unlike some other people's
ungrateful relatives?

41:54.913 --> 41:56.913
It was a heartbreak
for those left behind.

41:56.915 --> 41:59.749
They had to drag themselves through
their wretched, lonely existence.

41:59.751 --> 42:02.018
- Barely making it through the day.
- Stop.

42:02.020 --> 42:05.021
What's the follow on on
the profile on Courtney?

42:05.023 --> 42:08.224
Oh, depends. If it's found an
accident we talk fire safety.

42:08.226 --> 42:10.961
- Meanwhile you're following money.
- Exactly.

42:11.163 --> 42:15.296
Good episode. We're running a feature
promoting it on the front page.

42:15.300 --> 42:17.266
- I wrote it myself.
- Thanks.

42:17.268 --> 42:21.121
Of course, since I had no details about
your life these past few years, I made it up.

42:21.123 --> 42:24.808
- Your season as a rodeo clown...
- What about trapeze artist?

42:24.810 --> 42:26.810
You still have time to
put that in, don't you?

42:26.812 --> 42:29.612
Dinner Sunday and
you're cooking this time.

42:29.614 --> 42:32.515
Okay, but healthy food this time.

42:39.891 --> 42:43.493
So, he was your... date?

42:43.495 --> 42:45.862
Again, you bury the
lead. You're a Lewiston?

42:45.864 --> 42:48.343
- My mother was.
- Why didn't you say anything?

42:48.366 --> 42:50.367
It's a long story.

42:50.369 --> 42:52.669
Listen... is Uncle Miles sick?

42:52.671 --> 42:54.938
He told me at dinner that
sometimes he plays hooky.

42:54.940 --> 42:57.474
Yeah, he may not come
in everyday but he's...

42:57.476 --> 42:59.842
he's still very much on the job.

43:05.317 --> 43:07.784
According to police,
Gina got out of her car,

43:07.786 --> 43:10.820
wandered into the woods
and simply vanished.

43:10.822 --> 43:13.283
I'm Alex McPherson and
this is "Recovered".

43:13.285 --> 43:15.058
When you ask anyone who knew her,

43:15.060 --> 43:17.921
one of the first things people
will mention is Gina's laugh.

43:17.923 --> 43:19.662
By 1:00 A.M. on November 7th,

43:19.664 --> 43:24.167
the police had already received a call
from Gina's mother, Antonetta DeSavio.

43:24.169 --> 43:25.635
On the second day,

43:25.637 --> 43:28.304
the police brought in tracking
dogs to cover the area.

43:28.306 --> 43:31.908
The trail went dead by a bluff a
quarter mile up from Casper Falls.

43:31.910 --> 43:35.609
We'll explore those questions,
especially the possibility of foul play

43:35.647 --> 43:38.014
and some surprising discoveries I found

43:38.016 --> 43:41.117
on the next episode of "Recovered".

43:51.263 --> 43:52.829
You still got it!

43:52.831 --> 43:54.564
Oh, thanks Mr. Mitchell.

43:54.566 --> 43:56.366
Thanks for letting me ride Goose.

43:56.368 --> 43:58.702
I think you can call me Howard now.

43:58.704 --> 44:01.070
I heard what you've been doing for Gina.

44:01.072 --> 44:03.640
Yeah, well we're trying anyway.

44:03.642 --> 44:05.542
Did she keep riding after middle school?

44:05.544 --> 44:07.777
Couldn't keep her out
of here in high school.

44:07.779 --> 44:10.680
Once she finally quit
going over to the Russells.

44:10.882 --> 44:12.615
Gina worked for the Russells?

44:12.617 --> 44:15.084
Yeah, about three months.

44:15.086 --> 44:16.519
Then she stopped cold.

44:16.521 --> 44:19.589
She wouldn't say why except that
she had to get away from the family.

44:19.591 --> 44:23.657
I was glad she was back. She
worked harder than any two guys.

44:23.728 --> 44:26.162
By that time, I'd
actually paid her to ride.

44:26.164 --> 44:27.337
- Really?
- Yeah.

44:27.339 --> 44:30.233
She got better all the time. That
girl could stick in the saddle.

44:30.235 --> 44:32.836
Any time I had a young
horse, no matter how wild,

44:32.838 --> 44:36.306
I could put Gina on and she'd bring
them along. She had a real gift.

44:36.308 --> 44:39.175
She wanted to be a trainer after
college. She talked about it all the time.

44:39.177 --> 44:41.410
Yeah, that would've been her dream.

44:47.152 --> 44:51.614
Okay. These two are definitely
corporations, but it's weird.

44:51.616 --> 44:56.125
They don't have any website of their own or
advertising or anything. I can't tell what they do.

44:56.127 --> 44:58.164
So, they only exist on paper.

44:58.166 --> 45:00.563
They must be past the
usual shell companies.

45:00.565 --> 45:04.100
Try Central PA Mechanics.

45:07.405 --> 45:10.373
Yeah, it's the same as all
of them. Two principals.

45:10.375 --> 45:12.908
Stan Russell. Wait, that's
the second principal?

45:12.911 --> 45:13.443
Yeah.

45:13.445 --> 45:16.980
Okay, I want you to make copies and
text me if anything else pops. Okay?

45:16.982 --> 45:18.581
Okay.

45:21.720 --> 45:24.688
It's nice running into you tonight.

45:25.290 --> 45:27.640
You've done well, Bradley.

45:27.642 --> 45:30.927
We're lucky, the business is family
entertainment at a good price point.

45:30.929 --> 45:32.195
Nice and steady?

45:32.197 --> 45:34.564
There is a limit I can do there.

45:34.566 --> 45:37.133
You know, he may not
have been able to say it

45:37.135 --> 45:40.149
but your father would be proud of you.

45:42.173 --> 45:44.974
Stan, hey. I need to
talk to you for a minute.

45:48.280 --> 45:49.513
What's up?

45:49.515 --> 45:52.882
Yeah, I was just wondering why you were
so happy with Courtney Jeffers' work,

45:52.884 --> 45:55.552
given she helped drive
you into bankruptcy?

45:55.554 --> 45:57.053
Are you... are you kidding me?

45:57.055 --> 45:58.888
You think that I...

45:58.890 --> 46:01.724
Courtney is of no use to me dead.

46:01.726 --> 46:04.093
I was filing a lawsuit for negligence.

46:04.095 --> 46:07.063
- She can't pay damages if she's dead!
- Right.

46:07.105 --> 46:10.267
What kind of company
is Central PA Mechanics?

46:10.469 --> 46:11.901
I've never heard of it.

46:11.903 --> 46:15.643
That's funny because you and Courtney
are listed as principals in the company.

46:16.107 --> 46:17.507
Check it out!

46:17.509 --> 46:19.175
Whatever.

46:19.177 --> 46:21.511
Hey, what are you doing here?
I thought you hate these things.

46:21.513 --> 46:23.346
With a passion.

46:23.348 --> 46:25.014
Are you working on Courtney's story?

46:25.016 --> 46:28.950
- I wouldn't dream of interfering, I'm mingling.
- Okay.

46:28.954 --> 46:33.921
Stan doesn't have an alibi for the
night of the fire, for what it's worth.

46:41.333 --> 46:44.172
Hey. I got your text. What's up?

46:44.235 --> 46:46.903
There's a comment section
on the podcast page.

46:46.905 --> 46:51.131
And someone posted on it.
There is a way down that cliff.

46:51.243 --> 46:53.543
I guess we should go check that out.

46:53.545 --> 46:55.278
Great idea.

46:57.949 --> 47:01.384
Mr. Mitchell told me that
she just quit suddenly

47:01.386 --> 47:04.552
- And she wouldn't tell him why.
- Huh.

47:04.789 --> 47:07.790
So, Stan Russell knew
Gina in high school,

47:07.792 --> 47:09.892
maybe he harassed her?

47:09.894 --> 47:14.932
I don't know that but certainly something happened
and she refused to work with him after that.

47:14.933 --> 47:20.664
Okay, so the comment read that there
was a way down from under the platform.

47:24.797 --> 47:27.410
Does that look like a foothold to you?

47:27.813 --> 47:29.950
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

47:31.783 --> 47:34.248
I got you! I got you! I got you!

47:37.939 --> 47:39.305
- Okay.
- Don't let go!

47:39.357 --> 47:40.689
I got you!

47:41.926 --> 47:44.327
Don't kick, okay? Don't kick.

47:44.329 --> 47:46.495
Stop telling me what to do and help me!

47:46.497 --> 47:48.765
- Just... I got you!
- You okay?

47:48.767 --> 47:51.601
You guys, go get help. Go get help! Now!

47:51.603 --> 47:53.541
- Okay. Hang in there.
- I can't.

47:53.543 --> 47:54.571
No, no, no. You're fine.

47:54.573 --> 47:56.673
I can't keep holding on. You
have to get me over to the side.

47:56.675 --> 47:57.840
How am I going to get you over there?

47:57.842 --> 47:59.408
- Swing me, okay?
- I'm not swinging you.

47:59.410 --> 48:01.193
You are. Just on three, swing.

48:01.195 --> 48:03.179
One... ahh!

48:03.181 --> 48:05.448
Okay, two.

48:05.450 --> 48:07.183
Okay, one more swing.

48:07.285 --> 48:08.751
Three!

48:10.622 --> 48:12.088
- Are you okay?
- Ha!

48:12.190 --> 48:13.890
Yeah! Great!

48:13.892 --> 48:15.458
Living the dream.

48:15.460 --> 48:19.328
Listen... do you see something,
like above me I could reach for?

48:19.330 --> 48:22.497
No, just hang in there,
you're fine. Help is coming.

48:22.500 --> 48:25.491
It's not exactly safe where I am.

48:27.139 --> 48:29.405
So look, I'm sure you
feel fine right now.

48:29.407 --> 48:32.008
Just make sure you take it
easy for the rest of the day.

48:32.010 --> 48:33.309
Okay.

48:33.311 --> 48:36.577
That platform should've been
tested at the start of the season.

48:37.782 --> 48:42.091
- Hey, uh, you okay?
- Yeah. I'm fine. Thank you.

48:50.195 --> 48:52.728
The young lady's only
been in town a week

48:52.730 --> 48:56.579
and somehow you two seem involved
in every emergency in town.

49:00.405 --> 49:02.405
Did he just call me young lady?

49:02.407 --> 49:05.608
Yes, he did. He's a little
old school like that.

49:05.610 --> 49:07.198
- Are you okay?
- Fine.

49:07.200 --> 49:11.147
It's so weird, like she hardly pressed up
against it and it just gave way like that.

49:11.149 --> 49:13.557
Yeah, well it looks like the
wood's rotted near the bottom

49:13.559 --> 49:16.774
so we'll try to recover the boards
from down below, take a look.

49:17.021 --> 49:18.587
Thanks.

49:23.128 --> 49:25.561
You know, that rail did
not break by accident,

49:25.563 --> 49:27.782
that was a set-up, that was sabotage.

49:27.784 --> 49:31.007
I know, I know. But look, clearly,
you've ticked off someone very dangerous.

49:31.068 --> 49:31.902
- Me?
- Yes!

49:31.904 --> 49:35.610
You. And if this is more and more what it
looks like then we need to be smart about this.

49:35.640 --> 49:37.873
- We need to think about our next move.
- Good idea.

49:37.875 --> 49:39.907
- Dad?   -
Hey. - Dad?

49:39.909 --> 49:41.111
- What happened?
- We're fine.

49:41.114 --> 49:43.045
Did you get any information
on those corporations?

49:43.047 --> 49:44.046
Yeah, a bunch.

49:44.048 --> 49:47.750
And I printed it out on
paper because, you know, you.

49:47.752 --> 49:50.084
- I'll go get them.
- Thank you.

49:51.422 --> 49:53.256
Talk about burying the lead.

49:53.258 --> 49:57.760
Well it was Kendall's rule, she insisted
that I treat her like every other employee.

50:00.131 --> 50:02.465
Does her mom work here too?

50:02.467 --> 50:07.336
No. She lives in Philadelphia. Kendall's
with me while she goes to school at Sperling.

50:07.338 --> 50:08.771
Oh.

50:08.923 --> 50:10.973
That's nice.

50:12.277 --> 50:13.743
I should, uh...

50:13.745 --> 50:15.778
go get cleaned up and
have a glass of wine...

50:15.780 --> 50:18.321
- Okay, I'll see you in the morning.
- Yeah. I'll see you.

50:18.323 --> 50:20.548
Oh, wait. I have something
for you too, Alex.

50:20.551 --> 50:21.851
What is it?

50:22.303 --> 50:27.156
it's Gina DeSavio
today, if she was today.

50:27.158 --> 50:32.161
There's a program that takes a photo and
ages the person. I thought you'd want it.

50:32.263 --> 50:33.863
Thank you.

50:43.942 --> 50:46.776
We're not ready to release
a statement just yet.

50:46.778 --> 50:49.846
I need everybody to stay
off the platform for now.

50:49.848 --> 50:52.348
Can you turn that up?

50:52.350 --> 50:54.150
Thanks.

50:54.152 --> 50:59.253
Drew Godfried and Alexandra McPherson were
both treated at the scene and released.

50:59.257 --> 51:02.425
Harrington F.D. will
investigate the incident.

51:02.427 --> 51:04.761
They're lucky they made it.

51:09.868 --> 51:12.802
They say, "stick in the
saddle", that's the expression.

51:12.804 --> 51:13.403
Ooh, I like that one.

51:13.405 --> 51:16.873
She was training horses when she was
a teenager so she'd be a pro by now.

51:16.875 --> 51:19.075
Maybe we should start looking
at horse farms in Kentucky.

51:19.077 --> 51:20.209
Why there?

51:20.211 --> 51:22.545
Well there was some evidence at
her mom's house that pointed to it.

51:22.547 --> 51:25.681
- It's just a theory, that's all.
- No, no, I'm totally into it. Keep going.

51:25.683 --> 51:28.350
I've started making a list
of farms that we could...

51:30.889 --> 51:33.554
I'll call you back.
I see him. I see him.

51:34.119 --> 51:35.624
Over there.

51:38.263 --> 51:39.751
Hey! Chris.

51:39.764 --> 51:40.563
Hi.

51:40.565 --> 51:41.797
What are you doing here?

51:41.799 --> 51:46.168
Uh, I just wanted to tell you that we've
ruled Courtney Jeffers' death a homicide.

51:46.170 --> 51:47.336
What'd you find?

51:47.338 --> 51:49.204
Well, nothing we want
in the paper right now

51:49.206 --> 51:52.574
but if you come across anything, any information
that might help with the investigation,

51:52.576 --> 51:55.978
please, share it and then back
off. Just let us do our job.

51:55.980 --> 51:58.514
- Okay, Then we're happy to help.
- Of course.

51:58.551 --> 52:01.050
In fact, you might want to
look into Courtney's clients.

52:01.052 --> 52:03.519
She put Stan Russell into bankruptcy.

52:03.521 --> 52:08.421
And I was interviewing this guy, Troy
Hines, for my podcast and he was a hot-head.

52:08.426 --> 52:11.494
- I mean, he got right in my face.
- Okay, thank you.

52:11.496 --> 52:14.297
This is, uh... very elaborate.

52:14.299 --> 52:15.798
This is for your show?

52:15.800 --> 52:19.001
Yeah, yeah, it helps me
keep everything organized.

52:19.003 --> 52:22.267
I'd love to interview you
if you have time. Now's good.

52:22.273 --> 52:24.707
I'm not sure my boss would love that
but I will get back to you on that.

52:24.709 --> 52:26.042
Thank you!

52:26.044 --> 52:27.476
Bye.

52:29.847 --> 52:32.415
Look, Courtney incorporated
all these companies

52:32.417 --> 52:35.284
with herself as one of the principals.

52:35.286 --> 52:37.386
She was starting her own businesses?

52:37.388 --> 52:40.289
All of them had one of her own
clients listed as principals

52:40.291 --> 52:45.026
but Stan Russell said he'd never heard
of the company that he was listed on.

52:45.029 --> 52:46.495
Do you believe him?

52:46.497 --> 52:48.697
I think it looks like they're
passed through companies, you know

52:48.699 --> 52:53.387
used for some kind of transaction, then all
the money's transferred out to somewhere else.

52:53.571 --> 52:58.274
So... was she hiding her
money or her clients'?

52:58.476 --> 53:00.743
I think maybe both.

53:00.745 --> 53:04.771
What if she was stealing from her clients
and one of them found out about it?

53:04.782 --> 53:07.717
Or she could've been working with them.

53:07.819 --> 53:11.620
Did we ever find out who that is,
Hugginn? She met with him every week.

53:11.622 --> 53:15.024
No, no luck yet. Nobody
here in Harrington.

53:15.026 --> 53:17.760
- Oh, I gotta go.
- Oh, are you sure?

53:17.762 --> 53:21.864
I'm going to cross reference company names with
the client list. It's going to be good times.

53:21.966 --> 53:24.398
- No thanks.
- Okay.

53:24.502 --> 53:27.737
Let me guess, you were a chef somewhere.

53:27.839 --> 53:32.108
I helped restructure a company
that owned Italian restaurants.

53:32.310 --> 53:34.643
I picked up a tip or two.

53:34.645 --> 53:37.046
And where do you call home now?

53:37.048 --> 53:39.215
Wherever I am, I guess.

53:39.217 --> 53:44.635
The last few years I travelled with my
mom to every place left on her bucket list.

53:44.639 --> 53:47.323
She'd been to every
continent by the end.

53:47.325 --> 53:48.858
What happened to your business?

53:48.860 --> 53:51.357
I asked my partners to buy me out.

53:51.359 --> 53:53.962
We were doing pretty
well so that floated me

53:53.964 --> 53:57.133
and paid for all of our travel.

53:57.135 --> 54:01.371
Now I think I'm going to have
to figure out what to do next.

54:01.673 --> 54:05.236
- She's lucky to have you.
- I was lucky to have her.

54:05.243 --> 54:07.677
She never wanted to come back here, huh?

54:07.679 --> 54:09.412
And I never knew why.

54:09.414 --> 54:12.815
She was okay that I wanted
to come but she wouldn't.

54:12.817 --> 54:16.485
She knew I loved Uncle Miles,
I loved my summers here,

54:16.487 --> 54:19.222
I loved working with him at the paper.

54:19.824 --> 54:24.693
But I started to feel
guilty, disloyal somehow.

54:24.695 --> 54:27.363
It's part of the reason
I didn't come back.

54:27.365 --> 54:31.167
So... maybe now you'll stick around?

54:31.169 --> 54:33.736
It'd be nice to know where
to send the Christmas cards.

54:33.738 --> 54:36.906
Jessica's grown five
inches since the last card!

54:36.908 --> 54:39.141
She sure has.

54:39.143 --> 54:40.476
Fireman John?

54:40.478 --> 54:43.112
Oh, that's Steve's friend.

54:43.114 --> 54:46.215
Steve's single friend.

54:46.417 --> 54:50.052
Who was training as an
E.M.T. when Gina disappeared.

54:52.957 --> 54:57.084
Yeah, I was out there every day. It
was my first missing person search.

54:57.412 --> 54:59.195
I wish I'd been there.

54:59.197 --> 55:00.763
Hey, no.

55:00.765 --> 55:03.666
No, no. We had plenty of people.

55:03.668 --> 55:06.302
We just had nothing to find.

55:06.334 --> 55:10.439
After a few weeks when it turned
into a recovery instead of a rescue,

55:10.441 --> 55:14.845
the volunteers started to fall
away. But there were regulars.

55:14.848 --> 55:16.579
Her family, some friends.

55:16.581 --> 55:19.215
This one guy turned up every day, uh,

55:19.217 --> 55:22.750
Tim... no, Todd... Travis, maybe?

55:22.754 --> 55:25.219
- Troy Hines?
- Yeah.

55:25.223 --> 55:27.123
Yeah, yeah, that's the guy.

55:27.125 --> 55:29.792
I think him and Gina were dating.

55:29.794 --> 55:31.690
Anyway, uh...

55:31.694 --> 55:36.532
He was there every single day.
It was like he was obsessed.

55:45.676 --> 55:47.843
You wanted to see me?

55:47.845 --> 55:51.647
You nearly fell off a platform into
a ravine. What were you thinking?

55:51.649 --> 55:53.983
Well, I didn't do it on
purpose, the railing broke.

55:53.985 --> 55:56.619
Which it just happened to
occur when you were there?

55:56.621 --> 55:58.688
That's a question.

55:58.690 --> 56:01.123
I've had the head of the forest service,

56:01.125 --> 56:04.393
the Sheriff and the Governor on
the phone already this morning.

56:04.395 --> 56:07.663
Is that why you're limping? You've
been throwing your weight around.

56:07.665 --> 56:08.764
I'm not.

56:08.766 --> 56:10.499
I saw it the other day too.

56:10.501 --> 56:12.868
Uncle Miles, are you okay?

56:12.870 --> 56:14.170
Not at all.

56:14.172 --> 56:17.640
I need full time family
home care, starting now.

56:17.642 --> 56:19.241
All right.

56:19.243 --> 56:21.544
How about I call cousin Lucinda?

56:21.546 --> 56:22.978
Or Randall?

56:22.980 --> 56:26.947
Well that's just mean. I
need comfort, not nagging.

56:27.085 --> 56:29.085
It's just a little bit of arthritis.

56:29.087 --> 56:32.054
It comes and goes depending
on how annoyed I am.

56:32.056 --> 56:34.222
Do you need anything? Seriously.

56:34.225 --> 56:36.759
I seriously need you to watch your back.

56:36.761 --> 56:40.895
We don't know what kind of a hornets
nest you and Drew have stirred up.

56:40.932 --> 56:43.264
Is Patterson in? I need to
speak with him immediately.

56:43.266 --> 56:44.320
- Russo!
- Sheriff.

56:44.323 --> 56:46.836
What does the medical
examiner want from me today?

56:46.838 --> 56:49.905
The toxicology I ran
on Courtney Jeffers.

56:52.377 --> 56:55.344
Tox report and poison assay? Russo, why?

56:55.346 --> 56:59.446
She had a very pronounced cerebral edema,
not caused by the fire, so I ran the tests.

56:59.450 --> 57:03.385
Bromethalin. She was poisoned
before the fire ever started.

57:03.387 --> 57:06.689
- Anybody else know about his?
- Not yet.

57:06.691 --> 57:09.658
This is the piece we
hold back from the public.

57:12.597 --> 57:14.979
- And when was this?
- Yeah, I mean it was 1998, but...

57:14.981 --> 57:16.799
- 2004?
- I can send you a picture of her from then.

57:16.801 --> 57:18.501
- And when did she leave?
- Sure.

57:18.503 --> 57:20.933
Yeah, she's 5'3", brunette.
She'd really stick in the saddle.

57:20.935 --> 57:23.038
You'd most likely have her
working with young horses.

57:23.040 --> 57:26.697
Perfect. Do you have an
email? Great! Thank you, sir.

57:26.878 --> 57:28.277
That sounded good.

57:28.279 --> 57:31.780
Yeah, they had a trainer there for a
year in 2004 that fits Gina's description.

57:31.782 --> 57:35.224
But like all the other farms they had a
bunch of women work there over the years.

57:35.226 --> 57:37.349
- Have we narrowed down our list at all?
- No.

57:37.355 --> 57:41.890
Alex, tell Miles this guy needs
a new collar. Something seasonal.

57:41.892 --> 57:43.725
Will do.

57:47.498 --> 57:48.998
No answer.

57:49.000 --> 57:50.466
It's not a name.

57:50.468 --> 57:54.370
You kept asking me if there
was somebody named Hugginn?

57:54.672 --> 57:56.505
It's the Hugg Inn.

57:56.507 --> 57:59.840
- What is that?
- It's an entry from Courtney's calendar.

57:59.844 --> 58:01.343
What is the Hugg Inn?

58:01.345 --> 58:03.512
It's a nickname for
the Grand Royal Hotel.

58:03.514 --> 58:06.715
- That needed a nickname?
- Oh, it was the 60s.

58:06.717 --> 58:09.868
I was a mere toddler but
the stories are outrageous.

58:09.870 --> 58:13.453
Anyway, it closed down in the '70s and there
were a bunch of different owners, and...

58:13.457 --> 58:14.957
Where is it?

58:14.959 --> 58:18.927
- On the square at, at... Rockbridge.
- Thank you.

58:19.597 --> 58:21.396
She's amazing.

58:22.900 --> 58:24.600
Wait, hold up.

58:24.602 --> 58:26.734
- What? Me?
- Yeah. Yeah.

58:27.271 --> 58:30.272
- It's okay, I've got this.
- I know, it just looks like fun.

58:30.274 --> 58:32.441
- What does?
- You know.

58:32.443 --> 58:34.710
- Oh... Miles called.
- Look, he's not wrong.

58:34.712 --> 58:38.345
You almost fell off a cliff, you shouldn't
be alone. So, it's either me or Chuck.

58:38.349 --> 58:40.015
Get in.

58:43.664 --> 58:45.421
Let's do this!

58:49.127 --> 58:50.659
Hi Mr. Russell. How can I help you?

58:50.661 --> 58:53.095
I need to close three accounts.

58:53.097 --> 58:58.400
We'll do a wire transfer
to... this account.

59:12.049 --> 59:14.248
- It's charming.
- Yeah.

59:14.252 --> 59:16.852
More of a tourist stop these days.

59:17.054 --> 59:20.407
Really? Meaning you wouldn't
run into locals here?

59:20.458 --> 59:22.154
Interesting.

59:37.842 --> 59:40.209
She must have rented the room long term,

59:40.211 --> 59:43.279
that's how she kept having the
same number. Maybe an affair?

59:43.281 --> 59:46.749
Right. Which means she
wasn't staying here alone.

59:46.751 --> 59:48.784
314.

59:48.886 --> 59:51.115
Or... you're wrong

59:51.189 --> 59:55.455
and we're about to walk in on a couple of
nice living people who just want their privacy.

59:55.626 --> 59:58.360
Then you better come up
with a good cover story.

59:58.362 --> 01:00:00.195
Where are you going?

01:00:02.300 --> 01:00:03.899
Hi. Excuse me.

01:00:03.901 --> 01:00:08.268
May I please, um, just have a few
extra towels? Thank you so much.

01:00:08.512 --> 01:00:10.939
That's a good idea.

01:00:18.015 --> 01:00:21.683
Drew... this is the purse
Courtney had when I saw her.

01:00:21.685 --> 01:00:25.087
Whoa! Don't... touch anything.

01:00:25.289 --> 01:00:27.436
Do you have gloves?

01:00:27.458 --> 01:00:29.324
No. Do you?

01:00:29.393 --> 01:00:30.626
Yeah, normally.

01:00:30.628 --> 01:00:33.295
This is definitely a crime scene.

01:00:33.397 --> 01:00:36.563
Here. Use these to touch anything.

01:00:36.567 --> 01:00:38.300
Okay.

01:00:41.272 --> 01:00:45.236
How much do you want to bet that
this is where Courtney was killed?

01:00:45.676 --> 01:00:47.609
There was definitely a struggle here.

01:00:47.611 --> 01:00:49.952
Look at this, there's dry blood.

01:00:55.286 --> 01:00:58.755
Hey, look at this. They're maps.

01:00:59.957 --> 01:01:04.058
- Are they property lots?
- Looks like it. Oh, that's good.

01:01:04.061 --> 01:01:06.228
- We should call the Sheriff.
- Yeah, definitely.

01:01:06.230 --> 01:01:09.298
- Let's check the trash first.
- Okay.

01:01:13.170 --> 01:01:14.937
Fourth Ave Hardware.

01:01:14.939 --> 01:01:18.073
Gosh, that's Stan Russell's store.

01:01:23.247 --> 01:01:25.780
- Okay, let's get out of here.
- Okay.

01:01:25.816 --> 01:01:29.518
Hey. No, tell the Sheriff
to come to room 314.

01:01:30.254 --> 01:01:31.770
No, you're going to want to see this.

01:01:31.772 --> 01:01:33.814
- Hey. This way.
- Okay.

01:01:33.816 --> 01:01:35.657
Okay, bye.

01:01:38.996 --> 01:01:42.692
Drew. This could be a back staircase.

01:01:47.805 --> 01:01:52.028
He could come in and out from here
without ever being seen by the front desk.

01:01:52.376 --> 01:01:55.210
Or it's a good way to get a body out.

01:02:03.954 --> 01:02:05.822
Hey.

01:02:06.524 --> 01:02:08.223
You okay?

01:02:08.425 --> 01:02:09.258
Yeah, yeah.

01:02:09.360 --> 01:02:12.294
I've just never seen a fresh
crime scene before, you know?

01:02:12.296 --> 01:02:13.195
Yeah.

01:02:13.197 --> 01:02:16.181
Poor Courtney. Who would...

01:02:16.983 --> 01:02:19.168
Who could do that?

01:02:19.170 --> 01:02:20.669
I don't know.

01:02:20.671 --> 01:02:23.472
But if we find the person
that was in that room...

01:02:23.474 --> 01:02:25.907
then we find our killer.

01:02:29.080 --> 01:02:30.946
Well, that's a new look for you.

01:02:30.948 --> 01:02:33.035
I thought you would want
to know this immediately.

01:02:33.050 --> 01:02:35.193
Ask me who I play tennis with?

01:02:35.203 --> 01:02:39.254
Kathy Russell, Stan
Russell's soon to be ex-wife.

01:02:39.256 --> 01:02:42.323
- She said he bailed.
- Bailed?

01:02:42.325 --> 01:02:44.259
Right after the business alliance lunch

01:02:44.261 --> 01:02:47.696
he cleaned out their bank
account and blew town.

01:02:47.698 --> 01:02:49.898
Left her one year's
worth of child support.

01:02:49.900 --> 01:02:52.183
He sounded twitchy on
the phone. Her word.

01:02:52.186 --> 01:02:56.451
- So, he fled?
- No forwarding address.

01:02:57.942 --> 01:02:59.408
You're welcome.

01:02:59.410 --> 01:03:03.039
- I'm going to start researching.
- Great. Thank you.

01:03:03.858 --> 01:03:06.565
Okay, we should call the
Sheriff. Can't he get a warrant?

01:03:06.567 --> 01:03:09.482
For what, for travel? Stan
didn't even do anything wrong.

01:03:09.484 --> 01:03:10.853
Look, he's supposed to be broke

01:03:10.855 --> 01:03:15.023
and all of a sudden he has enough money to
just run off. How is that not suspicious?

01:03:18.028 --> 01:03:19.895
Well that's interesting.

01:03:19.897 --> 01:03:22.730
Didn't Troy tell us that
Courtney left him for a rich guy?

01:03:22.733 --> 01:03:24.937
Troy's driving a car like
that, he's not hurting.

01:03:24.939 --> 01:03:29.670
Maybe it's her car, you did say he'd
moved on, didn't want us messing it up.

01:03:29.940 --> 01:03:31.573
Does that make sense?

01:03:31.575 --> 01:03:32.741
Hey guys.

01:03:32.743 --> 01:03:34.042
Chuck, hey.

01:03:34.044 --> 01:03:35.610
Did you find anything
at the hardware store?

01:03:35.612 --> 01:03:39.081
No, nothing. They wipe the security footage
every 48 hours. There's nothing there.

01:03:39.083 --> 01:03:41.049
Now, the receipt, it was for cash.

01:03:41.051 --> 01:03:42.951
But the kid at the store, he
couldn't remember who bought it.

01:03:42.953 --> 01:03:45.521
- Did you find out what it was for?
- Rat poison.

01:03:45.523 --> 01:03:48.590
Look, here's the brand,
list of the ingredients.

01:03:49.159 --> 01:03:51.458
- Good work, Chuck.
- Yeah, good job.

01:03:51.462 --> 01:03:55.208
Now, I'm just saying hypothetically
if you did run any tests, Russo,

01:03:55.210 --> 01:03:57.900
that you should check for rat poison.

01:03:58.002 --> 01:04:02.761
No, I'll send you the link for the brand and
the ingredients. Then you get back to me, okay?

01:04:02.763 --> 01:04:05.141
Great. Thank you.

01:04:06.010 --> 01:04:08.393
Taco Tuesday came early, okay?

01:04:08.395 --> 01:04:09.711
Sure.

01:04:09.713 --> 01:04:11.046
Rat poison?

01:04:11.048 --> 01:04:12.247
Yeah, I know.

01:04:12.249 --> 01:04:14.649
It's nasty but it's possible.

01:04:14.651 --> 01:04:17.953
Just... don't think about it. Okay?

01:04:18.166 --> 01:04:19.522
Okay.

01:04:19.557 --> 01:04:21.289
Tell me that's English homework.

01:04:21.291 --> 01:04:22.725
Sure.

01:04:22.987 --> 01:04:25.397
All right. What have you got?

01:04:25.499 --> 01:04:28.838
I found owners for the properties
on your paper map thing.

01:04:28.840 --> 01:04:30.431
- Oh yeah?
- Yeah.

01:04:30.444 --> 01:04:34.736
Lot 17 is owned by Clearvale Properties.
They have an address up in Wallace Falls.

01:04:34.738 --> 01:04:36.571
Who owns the company?

01:04:36.573 --> 01:04:40.308
Just Courtney. They buy real
estate and then sell it fast.

01:04:40.310 --> 01:04:44.212
To who? No... wait. Tomorrow. All right.

01:04:44.214 --> 01:04:47.082
I want you to eat your dinner
and then you're going to go out.

01:04:47.084 --> 01:04:50.650
- Out?
- Yeah, you know, with friends and have fun. On campus.

01:04:51.288 --> 01:04:53.021
You are adorable!

01:04:53.023 --> 01:04:54.222
Why?

01:04:54.224 --> 01:04:58.527
I'm having two different conversations with
friends right now and searching property records.

01:04:58.529 --> 01:05:01.426
- Do you know Mary
Rogers? - Nuh-uh.

01:05:01.432 --> 01:05:03.315
- Jack Gardner?
- No.

01:05:03.317 --> 01:05:04.399
Troy Hines?

01:05:04.401 --> 01:05:06.018
Troy Hines, yeah. What about Troy Hines?

01:05:06.020 --> 01:05:09.569
His name is on one of these companies
that bought and sold property.

01:05:09.573 --> 01:05:12.674
An LLC called Green Hills Associates.

01:05:12.676 --> 01:05:14.175
Ah-ha.

01:05:15.446 --> 01:05:17.312
Good work.

01:05:17.314 --> 01:05:18.947
Thanks!

01:05:20.384 --> 01:05:21.883
There are two people.

01:05:21.885 --> 01:05:25.220
Two suspects who are connected
to both Gina and Courtney.

01:05:25.222 --> 01:05:29.524
Troy Hines and Stan Russel,
who took off without a warning.

01:05:29.526 --> 01:05:32.260
Maybe the sheriff can't pursue him now.

01:05:32.262 --> 01:05:35.230
But we can't cross him off our list.

01:06:00.290 --> 01:06:03.176
Russo, hey. Thanks for calling me back.

01:06:03.193 --> 01:06:08.161
No, listen, I understand that the Sheriff
put an embargo on the autopsy but...

01:06:08.198 --> 01:06:11.099
Russo, come on, it's me. I mean...

01:06:11.101 --> 01:06:13.201
Yes, but can you at least
confirm that there was

01:06:13.203 --> 01:06:16.638
a substance found without
naming exactly what it was?

01:06:18.742 --> 01:06:20.242
Yes!

01:06:20.244 --> 01:06:24.486
Of course. Deep
background, unnamed source.

01:06:25.682 --> 01:06:27.049
Thank you.

01:06:27.251 --> 01:06:28.650
Great.

01:06:28.852 --> 01:06:30.685
Nice!

01:06:36.090 --> 01:06:38.360
Troy Hines.

01:06:56.514 --> 01:06:58.346
How many calls do you have left to make?

01:06:58.348 --> 01:07:01.050
- I'm done, all 200 calls.
- What, really?

01:07:01.052 --> 01:07:03.018
Oh yeah, I'm super
caffeinated. I'm just flying.

01:07:03.020 --> 01:07:05.287
Well I have two possible maybes here.

01:07:05.289 --> 01:07:08.955
Okay, I have five. So that's seven women
that are definitely possible maybes.

01:07:08.959 --> 01:07:11.159
I wish there was a way we could
narrow it down a little bit.

01:07:11.161 --> 01:07:12.194
There is.

01:07:12.196 --> 01:07:16.098
Chuck, where is the database
for The Chronicle subscriptions?

01:07:16.200 --> 01:07:18.165
- Should I ask Drew?
- If you could.

01:07:18.168 --> 01:07:19.568
Yeah, I will.

01:07:22.239 --> 01:07:23.539
- Hey.
- Where are you?

01:07:23.541 --> 01:07:24.873
Just leaving, what did you find out?

01:07:24.875 --> 01:07:27.173
- How quickly can you get back?
- Why, what's up?

01:07:27.177 --> 01:07:29.839
We're going to see a
woman about a horse.

01:07:37.321 --> 01:07:39.654
If you could get about half
the mail you could see that,

01:07:39.656 --> 01:07:42.289
I don't know, how many other
companies are at that same address.

01:07:42.326 --> 01:07:45.892
Well I can see four names
here. Central PA Mechanics.

01:07:45.894 --> 01:07:46.926
Stan Russell.

01:07:46.928 --> 01:07:50.199
- Green Hills Associates.
- Troy Hines.

01:07:50.501 --> 01:07:53.335
This one says Clearvale Properties.

01:07:53.337 --> 01:07:56.371
Now that is just Courtney
and another corporation.

01:07:56.473 --> 01:07:59.072
That's weird. A corporation, not a name.

01:07:59.109 --> 01:08:01.105
Yeah. It is weird.

01:08:01.178 --> 01:08:02.844
Hey, let's switch. I'll drive.

01:08:02.846 --> 01:08:03.845
No, I'm fine.

01:08:03.847 --> 01:08:05.747
You took most of the night, come on.

01:08:05.749 --> 01:08:09.016
What about this next
one... Aderly Security?

01:08:09.019 --> 01:08:10.585
Now that I don't know.

01:08:10.587 --> 01:08:12.787
It's the one account that racked
up a bunch of consulting fees.

01:08:12.789 --> 01:08:15.390
But I do know that the
rest of the businesses

01:08:15.392 --> 01:08:17.658
did a bunch of real
estate with Clearvale

01:08:17.661 --> 01:08:20.362
that Courtney sold to them
at really inflated prices.

01:08:20.363 --> 01:08:22.363
Those companies must be loaded.

01:08:22.365 --> 01:08:24.038
Nuh-uh. Dead broke.

01:08:24.041 --> 01:08:26.468
Kendall's working on it but
it looks like all the money

01:08:26.470 --> 01:08:28.737
is disappearing offshore
once Clearvale pays.

01:08:28.738 --> 01:08:32.808
Courtney is involved with both ends of that
transaction. That's money laundering, right?

01:08:32.810 --> 01:08:35.109
Or just a good way to get a
lot of cash out of the country.

01:08:35.112 --> 01:08:37.145
- But whose?
- Well that's the question.

01:08:37.147 --> 01:08:39.014
So, I'm thinking is it Stan and Troy?

01:08:39.015 --> 01:08:40.948
Yeah, but where would they
come up with that kind of cash?

01:08:40.951 --> 01:08:44.051
I don't know, it could be a payoff
to use their names as the dummy corp.

01:08:44.054 --> 01:08:45.520
That just makes them shady.

01:08:45.522 --> 01:08:49.089
Still doesn't explain where all that
money's coming from that Courtney's moving.

01:08:49.091 --> 01:08:52.093
Someone who'd kill her to keep it.

01:08:52.095 --> 01:08:54.488
Or keep her quiet.

01:08:54.491 --> 01:08:55.897
You know you're right.

01:08:55.899 --> 01:08:58.500
The motive for Courtney's
murder must've been greed.

01:08:58.502 --> 01:09:03.251
So, let me ask you... Why are
you driving all night with me?

01:09:03.283 --> 01:09:05.640
Because if you found Gina DeSavio,

01:09:05.642 --> 01:09:08.009
that's a huge story.

01:09:09.473 --> 01:09:11.645
That's a big if.

01:09:17.354 --> 01:09:20.654
They say that it's very hard for
people to disappear completely.

01:09:20.657 --> 01:09:23.779
No matter their motivation,
it's hard to walk away from

01:09:23.782 --> 01:09:28.162
everything you ever had or knew without
holding on to at least one thread.

01:09:28.165 --> 01:09:32.165
You might send a signal to a loved one
to at least let them know you're alive.

01:09:32.169 --> 01:09:36.537
So they don't grieve needlessly.
And you keep hobbies or habits.

01:09:36.540 --> 01:09:39.573
We had seven leads that
sounded possible for Gina...

01:09:39.576 --> 01:09:43.542
the right age, general description,
they seemed to move around a lot.

01:09:43.546 --> 01:09:46.915
But Valerie Taylor
at Ramsey Springs Farm

01:09:46.917 --> 01:09:49.551
had something that
the other six didn't...

01:09:49.553 --> 01:09:54.388
A brand-new digital subscription
to the Harrington Chronicle.

01:10:00.030 --> 01:10:01.797
Come on.

01:10:05.919 --> 01:10:07.736
Hi, Gina.

01:10:13.510 --> 01:10:16.945
I, uh... you got here fast.

01:10:16.947 --> 01:10:21.181
I was hoping to have a little more time
to get Peaches settled before I left.

01:10:21.601 --> 01:10:24.152
It's really good to see you.

01:10:33.030 --> 01:10:34.796
I have so many questions.

01:10:34.798 --> 01:10:37.231
Why didn't you just leave things alone?

01:10:37.234 --> 01:10:39.447
The last few years I finally felt free.

01:10:39.449 --> 01:10:42.771
The older I get the more I think
good, no one's going to recognize me.

01:10:42.773 --> 01:10:45.273
Maybe I could sneak back and see Mom.

01:10:45.275 --> 01:10:47.563
What I wouldn't give
to just hug her again.

01:10:47.567 --> 01:10:51.313
- Why did you disappear?
- Because I had to.

01:10:51.415 --> 01:10:52.980
That's it?

01:10:53.951 --> 01:10:57.419
Whatever it was, it
happened 20 years ago.

01:10:57.421 --> 01:11:00.036
- You don't know.
- Then tell me.

01:11:00.040 --> 01:11:02.257
Look, I get it, something scared you.

01:11:02.259 --> 01:11:05.193
But we could help you fix it.

01:11:05.595 --> 01:11:07.963
We've got your back.

01:11:08.365 --> 01:11:12.133
We believe you, Gina.
Just tell us the truth.

01:11:15.472 --> 01:11:17.639
You have your recorder?

01:11:25.182 --> 01:11:28.216
I didn't think anything of it at first.

01:11:31.818 --> 01:11:35.857
There was a man standing at the wait station
beside a tray full of champagne glasses,

01:11:35.859 --> 01:11:38.660
which I thought was weird.

01:11:40.564 --> 01:11:43.398
I startled him when I came up.

01:11:46.169 --> 01:11:49.053
He just took one of the
champagne glasses and took off,

01:11:49.055 --> 01:11:51.072
which I also thought was weird.

01:11:51.074 --> 01:11:53.174
And I saw that there were
still pills on the ground

01:11:53.176 --> 01:11:56.311
so I picked them up and I
slipped them into my pocket.

01:11:59.082 --> 01:12:01.983
I took the tray and I went
over to his party to serve them.

01:12:01.985 --> 01:12:04.185
The pill guy was with
an older gentleman.

01:12:04.187 --> 01:12:06.750
They already had champagne.
They were toasting.

01:12:06.757 --> 01:12:09.311
One of those glasses,
had to be from my tray.

01:12:09.313 --> 01:12:12.593
15 minutes later there
was a crash in that banquet

01:12:12.595 --> 01:12:15.296
and I went running in and that
older man was on the floor.

01:12:15.298 --> 01:12:18.316
People were yelling that Mr.
Williford had a heart attack.

01:12:18.318 --> 01:12:20.568
And then he stood up.

01:12:20.570 --> 01:12:25.064
And I realized for the first time
who it was that I saw at the bar...

01:12:25.075 --> 01:12:27.375
Bradley Williford.

01:12:28.478 --> 01:12:33.114
He just looked at me like
I knew what he had done.

01:12:38.588 --> 01:12:41.940
And my brain just froze. I
wanted to get out of there.

01:12:41.942 --> 01:12:46.191
I grabbed my purse, I grabbed my
coat and I headed for a side door.

01:12:46.213 --> 01:12:48.663
I didn't make it very far.

01:12:48.665 --> 01:12:50.064
[Alex]: What happened?

01:12:50.066 --> 01:12:52.193
[Gina]: This goon stops me.

01:12:52.636 --> 01:12:54.903
He had a gun tucked in his waistband.

01:12:54.905 --> 01:12:56.988
He made sure I saw it too.

01:12:56.990 --> 01:12:59.240
He wanted to clarify
any misunderstanding

01:12:59.242 --> 01:13:01.643
that I might have had,
what I might have seen.

01:13:01.645 --> 01:13:03.579
Bradley Junior doctored that drink.

01:13:03.582 --> 01:13:06.781
That creep drugged his own dad right out
there in front of all of those people!

01:13:06.783 --> 01:13:09.451
I just tell this goon
that I never saw anything.

01:13:09.453 --> 01:13:13.388
And then he says to me that I might actually
even be happier living in another town.

01:13:13.390 --> 01:13:15.156
That it would be better for everyone,

01:13:15.158 --> 01:13:18.459
especially for my mom Antonetta
and my little sister Angela.

01:13:18.461 --> 01:13:21.394
- He knew their names.
- Why didn't you call the cops?

01:13:21.398 --> 01:13:24.399
Bradley Williford and
the cops are buddies.

01:13:24.401 --> 01:13:29.135
God, the Willifords were such an important
family in that town. Who's going to believe me?

01:13:29.137 --> 01:13:34.023
Besides, this guy got his order
from Williford and he wanted me gone.

01:13:34.084 --> 01:13:37.712
So, I got in my car and I didn't know
what to do, I didn't know where to go.

01:13:37.714 --> 01:13:41.516
If he knew our names, he probably knew
where I lived, where I was going to go.

01:13:41.518 --> 01:13:44.185
So, I just kept driving and
suddenly this truck comes up

01:13:44.187 --> 01:13:47.321
so fast that I hit a boulder.

01:13:48.759 --> 01:13:50.658
You hit your head on the windshield.

01:13:50.660 --> 01:13:52.360
Honestly, I didn't even feel that.

01:13:52.362 --> 01:13:55.263
At that point, I was just
running on adrenaline.

01:13:55.265 --> 01:13:58.633
I knew it was that guy with the
gun and I couldn't outrun him.

01:13:58.635 --> 01:14:01.168
So, I hid and waited.

01:14:16.219 --> 01:14:18.453
[Man]: Hey, is everyone okay?

01:14:18.455 --> 01:14:20.889
And so, the goon had
to go back to the road.

01:14:20.891 --> 01:14:22.757
And that was my chance.

01:14:22.759 --> 01:14:25.460
I just kept going, and going and going.

01:14:25.462 --> 01:14:29.530
I went down a cliff, up
the stream to the bridge.

01:14:30.517 --> 01:14:33.001
I know it was stupid to keep
the pills that he dropped,

01:14:33.003 --> 01:14:35.569
it's worthless as evidence in court.

01:14:37.574 --> 01:14:39.574
Why did you hold onto them for so long?

01:14:39.576 --> 01:14:42.159
Someone wanted me dead,
I don't even know who.

01:14:42.163 --> 01:14:44.579
For the past 20 years I
have looked over my shoulder.

01:14:44.581 --> 01:14:48.182
I thought maybe they'd
be some kind of insurance.

01:14:48.184 --> 01:14:50.618
I took them to a vet that
I trust I few years back.

01:14:50.620 --> 01:14:53.487
Got it tested. Cyanide.

01:14:55.058 --> 01:14:58.760
Did you hear that Courtney Jeffers died?

01:14:58.762 --> 01:15:02.497
Yeah, on The Chronicle
website. It's house fire?

01:15:02.499 --> 01:15:05.583
The fire was staged. She'd
already been poisoned.

01:15:05.585 --> 01:15:08.268
Bradley? Or what about
that guy that was after me?

01:15:08.271 --> 01:15:11.755
We don't know who killed Courtney
or who came after you, but

01:15:11.757 --> 01:15:14.275
I know one way to find out.

01:15:35.332 --> 01:15:37.098
I could have trouble.

01:15:37.100 --> 01:15:40.060
Sky Zone. Now.

01:15:54.718 --> 01:15:57.351
I'm sorry, we're closed for the night.

01:15:57.353 --> 01:15:59.053
Right. We know.

01:15:59.055 --> 01:16:01.859
Can you make an
appointment for tomorrow?

01:16:04.124 --> 01:16:07.095
Don't you recognize her?

01:16:07.097 --> 01:16:10.164
Gina DeSavio, you dropped these.

01:16:13.703 --> 01:16:15.269
Okay.

01:16:16.423 --> 01:16:18.539
I'll take those.

01:16:20.510 --> 01:16:22.410
Why don't you just
tell us why you did it.

01:16:22.412 --> 01:16:24.579
Why did you poison your father?

01:16:24.581 --> 01:16:27.348
The old man wasn't going
to let up or let go.

01:16:27.350 --> 01:16:28.916
I couldn't make any money.

01:16:28.918 --> 01:16:31.819
I built all this once I had
the chance. Anything else?

01:16:31.821 --> 01:16:33.855
Come on, Williford. Put the gun away.

01:16:33.857 --> 01:16:35.390
Hand over the tape.

01:16:35.392 --> 01:16:38.726
Of course I know you're
recording. Hand over the tape!

01:16:58.214 --> 01:17:00.948
Come on, real knots!

01:17:02.619 --> 01:17:04.452
Get away from him.

01:17:04.454 --> 01:17:06.764
Ah-ah-ah!
Forget it.

01:17:07.690 --> 01:17:08.989
Gina!

01:17:10.894 --> 01:17:12.727
Now you get to tie up your little buddy.

01:17:12.729 --> 01:17:15.162
Get over there, both of you!

01:17:15.929 --> 01:17:19.634
Patterson, you got my 9-1-1
call. You got here fast.

01:17:19.636 --> 01:17:22.270
I was in the area. So,
what's going on folks?

01:17:22.272 --> 01:17:23.971
Mr. Williford, let's
talk about this now.

01:17:23.973 --> 01:17:25.840
Let's try to find another
way out of this, okay?

01:17:25.842 --> 01:17:28.874
Right now, it's just me but in five minutes
the whole department's going to be here.

01:17:28.876 --> 01:17:31.011
And anything could happen.

01:17:32.716 --> 01:17:34.282
Okay.

01:17:36.570 --> 01:17:38.908
- Finish her off this time.
- What?

01:17:38.956 --> 01:17:41.122
If you'd done it right they
would've gone over the cliff

01:17:41.124 --> 01:17:43.023
and we wouldn't have
this problem, would we?

01:17:43.025 --> 01:17:45.092
Don't you have somewhere to go?

01:17:47.697 --> 01:17:49.964
You can't do this, okay?
The police are coming.

01:17:49.966 --> 01:17:52.833
We'll be long gone by then.
My squad car's out back.

01:17:52.835 --> 01:17:54.436
So let's go.

01:17:54.838 --> 01:17:56.904
Move! Let's go!

01:17:57.841 --> 01:18:00.575
You were supposed to kill
Gina. What about Courtney?

01:18:00.577 --> 01:18:03.177
Who wanted her gone? Was
that you or Williford?

01:18:03.179 --> 01:18:04.878
- He had to be the boss.
- Yeah.

01:18:04.881 --> 01:18:07.083
Yeah, you're Williford's
boy, huh? His goon.

01:18:07.085 --> 01:18:08.715
- I'm nobody's
boy. - Mm-hmm.

01:18:08.719 --> 01:18:11.384
You're partners, is that
how that works? Please...

01:18:11.387 --> 01:18:12.720
Shut up.

01:18:13.256 --> 01:18:16.190
Aderly Security... That's you, isn't it?

01:18:16.292 --> 01:18:19.726
The money. Really? You're
just doing this for money?

01:18:19.728 --> 01:18:21.896
Hey... keep walking.

01:18:22.198 --> 01:18:24.678
Clean up after a murder,
that's got to cost.

01:18:24.680 --> 01:18:27.568
- What's the price for poisoning?
- Well that wasn't me.

01:18:27.570 --> 01:18:29.737
Look, Courtney showed up
with an ultimatum for Brad,

01:18:29.739 --> 01:18:31.973
saying she suddenly remembered
what he did to his dad.

01:18:31.975 --> 01:18:34.008
And that, uh, it was going to cost.

01:18:34.010 --> 01:18:38.345
So, does he handle it? No, the idiot doses her and
then he calls me to somehow cover it up for him.

01:18:38.347 --> 01:18:40.581
Gina, I'm so sorry I got you into this.

01:18:40.583 --> 01:18:42.450
I keep thinking about when we were kids,

01:18:42.452 --> 01:18:45.185
how we would ride and have fun. I was...

01:18:45.187 --> 01:18:50.589
How I was so good at the half-seat
but boy, you knew how to post.

01:18:53.296 --> 01:18:54.595
Move.

01:18:58.768 --> 01:19:01.102
Gina, quick. Untie me.

01:19:02.772 --> 01:19:04.338
Take the gun, take it.

01:19:04.440 --> 01:19:06.523
Here. Go get him!

01:19:07.177 --> 01:19:10.101
Call my uncle. Call my
uncle, he'll get help.

01:19:27.283 --> 01:19:28.729
Freeze!

01:19:30.033 --> 01:19:32.033
You think you're a better shot than me?

01:19:32.035 --> 01:19:35.503
Ten years on shooting ranges
with Philly's finest. Maybe...

01:19:35.505 --> 01:19:37.671
You want to take that chance?

01:19:38.741 --> 01:19:39.974
Go.

01:19:55.126 --> 01:20:01.663
[sirens wailing]

01:20:01.963 --> 01:20:05.032
Sounds like my chief of detectives'
not going down by himself.

01:20:05.034 --> 01:20:07.201
- Is he talking?
- He won't shut up about it.

01:20:07.203 --> 01:20:10.137
Unit picked up Bradley
Williford boarding a private jet.

01:20:10.139 --> 01:20:12.072
We'll exhume his father's
body in the morning.

01:20:12.074 --> 01:20:14.441
We think we have enough to
charge him with both murders.

01:20:14.443 --> 01:20:15.797
Wow.

01:20:20.793 --> 01:20:22.450
Hey.

01:20:24.654 --> 01:20:26.520
Come here!

01:20:32.562 --> 01:20:35.396
Oh... you're beautiful.

01:20:38.851 --> 01:20:42.970
After 19 years, seven
months and 18 days,

01:20:42.972 --> 01:20:46.507
Gina DeSavio was finally
able to come home.

01:20:46.509 --> 01:20:49.693
And as luck would have it,
Mitchell stables was looking for

01:20:49.695 --> 01:20:52.229
a trainer to work with
their young horses.

01:20:52.231 --> 01:20:56.250
So she could stay on and recove
the life she had to leave.

01:20:56.252 --> 01:20:59.754
Hot off the presses! I always
wanted to say that, so fun.

01:20:59.756 --> 01:21:04.008
Sheriff's Deputy business owner
charged with murder and embezzlement.

01:21:04.010 --> 01:21:08.229
Local woman recovered after 20
years missing is key witness.

01:21:08.231 --> 01:21:11.015
Boy, you two really earned it this week.

01:21:11.017 --> 01:21:13.868
You won't believe the
follow up I can do on this.

01:21:13.870 --> 01:21:17.238
Everyone, if you could
bring it in, please.

01:21:17.240 --> 01:21:19.073
Don't be shy.

01:21:24.380 --> 01:21:26.524
I want to thank you all

01:21:26.526 --> 01:21:29.066
for the hard work you've
done these past few days.

01:21:29.068 --> 01:21:30.551
Good news first.

01:21:30.553 --> 01:21:32.987
Ever since news of the arrest broke,

01:21:32.989 --> 01:21:35.456
everybody's been calling
in about "Recovered".

01:21:35.458 --> 01:21:38.092
They cannot wait for the new episodes.

01:21:38.094 --> 01:21:43.157
This podcast is going to drive advertising
for our little old paper for a good long while.

01:21:43.159 --> 01:21:46.633
And the embezzlement and
corruption stories Drew will write

01:21:46.635 --> 01:21:49.203
will be vital news for this community.

01:21:49.205 --> 01:21:50.937
Is there bad news?

01:21:50.974 --> 01:21:52.740
Well it depends on how you look at it.

01:21:52.742 --> 01:21:56.842
You all might have noticed I haven't
been around as much these days.

01:21:56.846 --> 01:21:59.680
Maybe you have some worry if
the paper will stay afloat.

01:21:59.682 --> 01:22:05.378
Well lucky for us I have family with a
business degree and a cash flow problem.

01:22:05.521 --> 01:22:09.505
- So, I'm going to step back.
- That's unlikely.

01:22:09.509 --> 01:22:12.226
And I'm naming Alexandra McPherson

01:22:12.228 --> 01:22:15.162
as our new managing editor.

01:22:17.053 --> 01:22:20.101
Wait... what?

01:22:20.103 --> 01:22:22.236
Help an old man out?

01:22:22.238 --> 01:22:23.904
Do you know any?

01:22:23.906 --> 01:22:26.473

01:22:30.513 --> 01:22:31.812
