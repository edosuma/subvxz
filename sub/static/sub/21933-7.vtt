Whoa!

Look at you!

00:05.806 --> 00:07.741
It's the biggest pitch
of our career, right?

00:07.808 --> 00:11.445
You want to be a winner,
you got to dress like one.

00:11.512 --> 00:13.981
Well, it's much better
than your normal look...

00:14.048 --> 00:15.683

and a Mets shirt.

That has a name.
It's called "couchletic."

00:20.221 --> 00:22.890
Okay. So, I have an idea
for the pitch today.

00:22.956 --> 00:24.892
Don't need new ideas.

00:24.958 --> 00:26.960
Let's just stick
to the plan.

00:27.027 --> 00:28.529
Let me finish, all right?

00:28.596 --> 00:30.398
I'm just thinking, instead of
some of the small talk,

we punch him
right in the throat
with a sizzle reel.

that sizzles.

supposed to do it,

07:54.575 --> 07:56.644
I mean, I can't
think of a better place.
Can you think of one?

07:56.710 --> 07:58.946
(QUIETLY) I can tell you,
that vitamin's kicking in.
It's kicking in.

08:04.117 --> 08:06.419
Hey, mountain lion!

08:06.486 --> 08:08.956
How did it go?
I'm on pinching needles.

08:10.257 --> 08:12.325
Go ahead, tell him.
I screwed it up.

08:12.392 --> 08:13.794
No.
Nobody screwed it up.

08:13.861 --> 08:15.195
We just didn't
get this one.

08:15.262 --> 08:16.296
Did you take the pill?

08:16.363 --> 08:18.131
Yep. Not good.

08:19.767 --> 08:21.234
He was a little chatty.

08:21.301 --> 08:22.603
And I was sweating a lot.

08:22.670 --> 08:25.138
Ah, I bet you took it
on an empty stomach.

08:25.205 --> 08:27.941
Yeah, like
that's possible.

08:28.008 --> 08:31.511
Okay, that was mean,
and I am sorry.

08:31.579 --> 08:32.780
It's fine.
I deserve it.

08:32.846 --> 08:33.947
I blew it back there.

08:34.014 --> 08:35.382
You have every right
to be mad.

08:35.448 --> 08:37.450
I am not mad.

08:37.517 --> 08:38.886
Look, there's lots of other
business out there.
We'll just get the next one.

08:38.952 --> 08:40.487
Okay, I see what
you're doing here.

08:40.554 --> 08:42.289
You're doing that thing where
you pretend not to be mad

08:42.355 --> 08:45.859
and you're acting all cool,
like, "Ooh, I'm cool".

08:45.926 --> 08:47.394
I'm not acting anything.

08:47.460 --> 08:48.829
You're my partner!

08:48.896 --> 08:50.230
This just didn't go
our way.

08:50.297 --> 08:51.865
Well, let's get it
to go our way, all right?

08:51.932 --> 08:53.567
Call Bill back.
Tell him I had a mini-stroke.

08:53.634 --> 08:54.968
No.
Yes!

08:55.035 --> 08:55.869
We'll get
a second chance!
No. No. Stop.

08:55.936 --> 08:57.537
I am not calling Bill.

08:57.605 --> 08:58.872
Let's just let this go.

08:58.939 --> 09:00.574
I won't take
the vitamin next time

09:00.641 --> 09:02.075
and I'll be
totally relaxed.

09:02.142 --> 09:03.977
Oh, relaxed?
I have something
for that, too.

09:04.044 --> 09:06.146
It's made out of melatonin
and maple syrup.

09:06.213 --> 09:08.148
They use it to calm down
animals at the zoo.

09:11.619 --> 09:13.186
Hey, kid, you tell her
the good news?

09:13.253 --> 09:15.522
(GASPS) The investors
changed their mind?

09:15.589 --> 09:16.857
They want to buy
your app?

09:16.924 --> 09:18.325
(CHUCKLES)
Not that good of news.

09:18.391 --> 09:21.995
Um, Enzo asked me if I
wanted to be the manager.

09:22.830 --> 09:25.098
Yeah, not as good.

09:25.165 --> 09:27.167
But I mean, you're gonna
tell him "No", right?

09:27.234 --> 09:30.237
I don't know. I mean,
the app is all but dead,

09:30.303 --> 09:33.206
whereas, manager of Enzo's,
I mean, that's a real thing.

09:33.273 --> 09:34.908
And I'm good at it.
Enzo was telling me that

09:34.975 --> 09:37.177
profits are up since I've
computerized the place.

09:37.244 --> 09:39.246
Yeah, but, babe,
I mean, we had a plan.

09:39.312 --> 09:41.414
(iPAD DINGS)
Oh, sorry...
I've got to go.

09:41.481 --> 09:42.716
Mwah.

09:43.751 --> 09:46.553
Little low on pretzels.

09:46.620 --> 09:48.088
Fill her up.

09:48.155 --> 09:49.623
Kendra.

09:50.691 --> 09:52.893
Kendra!
What?

09:52.960 --> 09:54.795
(SIGHS)
I'm sorry, what?

09:54.862 --> 09:56.263
You okay?
Yeah, I'm fine.

09:56.329 --> 09:58.632
I'm just...
I'm worried about Chale.

09:58.699 --> 10:00.033
He's talking about
giving up on his app

10:00.100 --> 10:01.501
and working here
full-time.

10:01.568 --> 10:03.003
Yeah.
Sounds about right.

10:03.070 --> 10:05.305
He's at that age where
a man starts to die inside.

10:05.372 --> 10:08.008
What? No! I don't
want that for Chale.

10:08.075 --> 10:09.710
Maybe you could
talk to him.

10:09.777 --> 10:11.211
Me?
Yeah.

10:11.278 --> 10:13.146
You had a dream that...

10:13.213 --> 10:16.717
went differently
than real life.

10:16.784 --> 10:18.585
Are you saying
I tasted failure?

10:18.652 --> 10:20.553
No. I don't mean...
No, no, no.

10:20.620 --> 10:22.055
(CHUCKLES) I have.

10:22.122 --> 10:23.924
I have sipped
from the cup of failure
more than once.

10:23.991 --> 10:25.759
Like your '80s
rock band?

10:25.826 --> 10:27.227
Ugh, I forgot about that.

10:27.294 --> 10:29.229
See? You had something
you were passionate about

10:29.296 --> 10:30.798
and you let it slip away,
and I just...

10:30.864 --> 10:32.199
I don't want that for Chale.

10:32.265 --> 10:33.967
You know,
we could have been huge.

10:34.034 --> 10:35.268
It's just that the other guys
didn't want it as much.

10:35.335 --> 10:37.270
Like Larry, you know?
He missed our showcase.

10:37.337 --> 10:39.206
"Oh, I got to see
the birth of my daughter."

10:39.272 --> 10:42.075
He already had a daughter.
How different could it be?

10:44.344 --> 10:46.346
Yes, I would like to
cancel my massage.

10:46.413 --> 10:48.882
The reason?
Oh, my boss panicked
in the big meeting

10:48.949 --> 10:53.286
and, uh, let's just say
that my employment here
is on shaky ground.

10:53.353 --> 10:55.723
All right, Sharon.
Thank you. Bye.

10:55.789 --> 10:56.924
Hey, where's Vanessa?

10:56.990 --> 10:58.491
Oh, she said she was
going to the doctor.

10:58.558 --> 10:59.626
My guess?

10:59.693 --> 11:01.628
Woman stuff.

11:01.695 --> 11:04.097
That's perfect,
'cause I'm going back
to the toy store,

11:04.164 --> 11:05.733
and this time,
I'm doing it alone.

11:05.799 --> 11:06.834
Oh, you need a pill?

11:06.900 --> 11:08.268
No! No pills.

11:08.335 --> 11:09.903
No, I'm just
gonna go in there,

11:09.970 --> 11:11.504
and I'm not leaving
till I get the account.

11:11.571 --> 11:14.007
Gonna to be like the champion
that I am, you know.

11:14.074 --> 11:16.076
And I'm doing it for me,
I'm doing it for you,

11:16.143 --> 11:18.411
I'm doing it for everybody
here at The Fist!

11:20.647 --> 11:22.315
Hey, there.
Hey.

11:22.382 --> 11:24.885
Oh, um, everyone's out
at the moment.

11:24.952 --> 11:26.887
Do you want me to tell them
you stopped by?

11:26.954 --> 11:28.789
Uh, no.
I'm actually here for you

11:28.856 --> 11:31.024
and where you're going
in life.

11:31.491 --> 11:32.726
Why?

11:32.793 --> 11:34.661
Well, you know,
you're my nephew now,

11:34.728 --> 11:36.563
and I just want to
make sure you don't make
the same mistakes I made.

11:36.629 --> 11:39.366
Are you talking about the time
you shaved your eyebrows?

11:39.432 --> 11:42.803
I didn't shave them.
I was lighting my grill.

11:42.870 --> 11:46.106
Anyway, I wanted to talk about
the fact that I was once part

11:46.173 --> 11:48.909
of a, uh, very promising
rock band.

11:48.976 --> 11:51.544
I actually hate the fact
that I walked away from it.

11:51.611 --> 11:54.114
I, I just don't want that
to happen to you.

11:54.181 --> 11:57.717
Oh. Well, why don't you
just go back to it?

11:57.785 --> 12:00.120
What's that, now?

12:00.187 --> 12:03.223
The band, why don't you just,
you know, start it up again?

12:03.290 --> 12:04.657
Oh, nah. Too old.

12:04.724 --> 12:07.995
Oh no, no, no. You're never
too old to follow your dreams,

12:08.061 --> 12:10.663
especially if it's something
you're good at.

12:10.730 --> 12:12.065
Interesting.

12:12.132 --> 12:14.467
It seems to me,
if being in a rock band

12:14.534 --> 12:17.838
is what you want to do,
then you should do that.

12:17.905 --> 12:19.372
You're right.

12:19.439 --> 12:22.175
I mean, Larry's girls
are off to college this year.

12:22.242 --> 12:25.078
Richard's new heart valve
is working fine.

12:25.145 --> 12:26.579
There's not a lot
holding us back.

12:26.646 --> 12:28.081
(CHUCKLES)
That's the spirit!

12:28.148 --> 12:29.817
(LAUGHS)
Rock 'n' roll!

12:29.883 --> 12:31.518
Hey, thanks for
the pep talk, Chale!

12:34.521 --> 12:35.923
Okay.

12:35.989 --> 12:37.490
Deep breath.
You can do this.

12:39.392 --> 12:42.262
Whoa.
What are you doing here?

12:42.329 --> 12:46.466
Um, I am shopping
for toys. I mean...

12:46.533 --> 12:48.301
You came here
to pitch to him again!

12:48.368 --> 12:51.104
No. I needed
one of these...

12:51.905 --> 12:53.506
These.
I can't...

12:55.575 --> 12:57.310
I cannot believe you.

12:57.377 --> 12:58.979
What happened
to all that stuff about
"letting this one go"?

12:59.046 --> 13:01.014
Okay, what I really meant
was you letting it go.

13:01.081 --> 13:03.817
I mean, you couldn't even
focus on a focus pill!

13:03.884 --> 13:05.152
"Why don't you adopt kids?

13:05.218 --> 13:06.653
"Maybe you won't be so sad.

13:06.719 --> 13:07.720
"I like ice cream.

13:07.787 --> 13:09.189
"Choca, Mocha,
Choca-Mocha!"

13:09.256 --> 13:11.258
Okay, for the last time,
I took a supplement

13:11.324 --> 13:12.860
from a trusted colleague,
all right?

13:12.926 --> 13:14.527
It didn't work out.
Sorry.

13:14.594 --> 13:15.829
Okay.

13:15.896 --> 13:17.364
We are making a scene.
Let's go inside.

13:17.430 --> 13:18.899
In. Let's go.

13:18.966 --> 13:20.433
In where?
In here.

13:23.536 --> 13:26.339
All right, look...
We need this account, okay?

13:26.406 --> 13:28.808
So, I thought it would be best
just to leave you at home

13:28.876 --> 13:31.845
where you can sizzle-pitch
by yourself.

13:31.912 --> 13:33.746
You should be ashamed.
Ugh.

13:33.813 --> 13:35.682
Coming here
behind my back.

13:35.748 --> 13:38.518
Honestly, you really
think that I...
Hold it, hold it.

13:40.387 --> 13:42.956
You know that's for
an infant, right?

13:43.023 --> 13:44.291
It'll never hold you.

13:44.357 --> 13:47.260
Yeah, okay.
I wasn't gonna sit on it.

13:47.327 --> 13:48.996
It's for this.
I was gonna do this.

13:49.062 --> 13:50.497
Is that what you
were gonna do?

13:50.563 --> 13:52.532
Yeah, yeah.
Very comfortable,
by the way.

13:52.599 --> 13:55.002
Just admit it, you came here
to pitch him, too.

13:55.068 --> 13:56.803
Okay, maybe I did.

13:56.870 --> 13:58.405
Because I can
get this account,
I just need a second chance.

13:58.471 --> 13:59.639
Oh, come on.

13:59.706 --> 14:01.008
You can't stay focused.

14:01.074 --> 14:02.575
I'm a different guy now!

14:02.642 --> 14:05.879
I'm telling you, I'm off
the sauce, I'm totally clean!

14:05.946 --> 14:07.380
Look, let me pitch you.

14:07.447 --> 14:08.848
I'll pitch you, and I promise
you, it'll be magic.

14:08.916 --> 14:10.350
Fine, just do it.

14:10.417 --> 14:11.751
You're never gonna shut up
until I hear it. Go, go!

14:11.818 --> 14:14.254
Give me a second here.
You ready?

14:14.321 --> 14:15.488
Okay.

14:15.555 --> 14:17.224
(SIGHS)

14:20.327 --> 14:21.661
Mr. Prince.

14:21.728 --> 14:22.996
Are you...
Are you gonna do that
with your hands?

14:23.063 --> 14:24.297
Yeah. It's called
"pyramid hands."

14:24.364 --> 14:26.900
It's very powerful.
Okay.

14:26.967 --> 14:30.803
Mr. Prince, I need you to ask
yourself this question...

14:30.870 --> 14:36.709
"Why do I need
Monkey Fist Security?"

14:36.776 --> 14:38.178
And then,
the doctor was like,

14:38.245 --> 14:39.779
"At this point
you can take the scab off

14:39.846 --> 14:40.981
"and it would be fine."

14:41.048 --> 14:42.349
And I was like,
"I, I totally disagree,

14:42.415 --> 14:44.017
"because I think
it's gonna leave a scar."

14:44.084 --> 14:45.185
Look at above the brow.
In the brow?
Yep.

14:45.252 --> 14:46.453
Nothing there?
Mnh-mnh.

14:46.519 --> 14:48.288
And it...
Back on the other thing...

14:48.355 --> 14:50.290
In conclosion...
Conclusion...

14:51.091 --> 14:52.659
These are all the reasons

14:52.725 --> 14:54.962
you should choose
Monkey Fist.

14:55.028 --> 14:56.563
(QUIETLY)
Pyramid hands.

14:58.365 --> 15:00.900
Okay, so, we know
it wasn't the pill.

15:03.971 --> 15:06.006
So, here's how
it's gonna down.

15:06.073 --> 15:07.507
I'm gonna do
all the pitching,

15:07.574 --> 15:09.576
and you just sit there
and say nothing.

15:09.642 --> 15:10.944
Yep.
Okay.

15:11.011 --> 15:12.345
What the heck?

15:16.549 --> 15:17.850
What time is it?

15:17.917 --> 15:20.487
(SCOFFS)
It's 10 after 8:00!

15:20.553 --> 15:21.688
(CHAINS RATTLE)

15:21.754 --> 15:23.856
There's chains
on the door.

15:23.923 --> 15:25.325
We are locked in here.

15:25.392 --> 15:27.627
They don't check the bathroom
for children or...

15:27.694 --> 15:29.529
adults.

15:35.202 --> 15:37.570
Now we're trapped
inside a toy store

15:37.637 --> 15:40.173
that we wanted to
provide security for.

15:40.240 --> 15:41.941
It's a good look.

15:42.976 --> 15:44.444
Relax. I already
texted Rootger.

15:44.511 --> 15:46.479
He'll get the message,
grab some bolt cutters,

15:46.546 --> 15:47.780
and he'll get us
out of here.

15:47.847 --> 15:48.948
Why don't we just
call the cops?

15:49.016 --> 15:50.483
That's a good idea.

15:50.550 --> 15:53.353
"Yeah, hello. We are two
retired police officers.

15:53.420 --> 15:56.123
"We're kind of trapped
inside of a toy store.

15:56.189 --> 15:57.924
"Uh-huh. Oh, and
it's a funny story

15:57.991 --> 16:00.427
"'cause we own
our own security company.
(LAUGHS)

16:00.493 --> 16:02.329
"Hello? Hello?"

16:02.395 --> 16:05.598
Boy, if you pitched as well
as you do fake phone calls,

16:05.665 --> 16:07.600
we would have
had that account.

16:07.667 --> 16:10.070
I'm just curious, are you
trying to sink our business?

16:10.137 --> 16:12.372
Just, like, actively
trying to do it?

16:12.439 --> 16:14.307
Because in
a partnership...

16:17.477 --> 16:19.512
You're a 12-year-old,
you know that? Okay...

16:19.579 --> 16:20.713
Oh!

16:20.780 --> 16:23.050
I am warning you,
I do not play well with...

16:23.116 --> 16:25.218
Knock it off!
Okay.

16:25.285 --> 16:27.120
Let's do it.
Oh!

16:28.288 --> 16:29.956
Hey, all right, stop!

16:30.023 --> 16:31.124
Stop it, stop!

16:31.191 --> 16:32.759
Yep. Yep. What?

16:32.825 --> 16:33.893
I got an idea.

16:33.960 --> 16:35.395
What?

16:35.462 --> 16:36.996
The crown.

16:37.064 --> 16:38.165
What about it?

16:38.231 --> 16:39.466
We get it, we grab it,

16:39.532 --> 16:41.234
we move it to
Mr. Prince's office.

16:41.301 --> 16:44.104
He comes in the morning,
he realizes it's been moved,

16:44.171 --> 16:47.140
and he's like,
"Huh, we need security!"

16:47.207 --> 16:49.008
Who's he gonna call?

16:49.076 --> 16:50.843
Okay. Well, even
if I agreed to this,

16:50.910 --> 16:52.779
I mean,
how would we get to it?

16:52.845 --> 16:54.347
Oh, I'll get to it.

16:56.316 --> 16:57.817
You just be thankful
you've got a partner

16:57.884 --> 16:59.319
who thinks
outside the box.

16:59.386 --> 17:00.787
Okay.

17:00.853 --> 17:02.455
Oh, and one more thing.

17:04.291 --> 17:05.658
Okay, when I
get up there,

17:05.725 --> 17:08.128
just get ready
to catch the crown, okay?

17:14.734 --> 17:16.269
Hey.
Hey.

17:16.336 --> 17:18.305
I just had the most
interesting conversation
with your uncle,

17:18.371 --> 17:20.740
a real eye-opener.
Oh, babe, that's great!

17:20.807 --> 17:22.142
It's official.

17:22.209 --> 17:24.077
You are looking at
the new manager of Enzo's.

17:24.144 --> 17:25.312
What?

17:25.378 --> 17:27.414
But didn't Kyle
talk to you about,

17:27.480 --> 17:29.116
you know,
following your dreams?

17:29.182 --> 17:30.817
He did, and that's
what I'm doing.

17:30.883 --> 17:32.419
I am so confused.

17:32.485 --> 17:35.488
Look, Kyle is getting his band
back together in his 50s,

17:35.555 --> 17:38.325
which made me realize
I have forever to do my app.

17:38.391 --> 17:40.260
But right now,
the one thing
that I really want

17:40.327 --> 17:42.329
is just to have
a dependable job,
you know,

17:42.395 --> 17:44.297
and I can start
looking after my wife.

17:44.364 --> 17:45.898
Babe, we'll be okay.

17:45.965 --> 17:47.100
You don't have
to do this.

17:47.167 --> 17:48.201
No, no, I do!

17:48.268 --> 17:49.869
Trust me,
this is the right move!

17:49.936 --> 17:52.772
Look, I came in here tonight
with a pep in my step,

17:52.839 --> 17:55.575
and all I want right now
is my woman to just

17:55.642 --> 17:57.310
jump into my arms!

17:58.111 --> 17:59.546
Jump into my arms!

18:00.113 --> 18:02.282
Have at it!

18:02.349 --> 18:04.751
Or we can just hug.
Yeah, that's better.

18:06.453 --> 18:08.455
I... All right,
I already regret this.

18:08.521 --> 18:11.524
Hey, I've done my calculations
perfectly, okay?

18:11.591 --> 18:13.360
If I get enough speed
coming down here

18:13.426 --> 18:15.528
and hit that trampoline
at the right velocity,

18:15.595 --> 18:17.564
that momentum's gonna
carry me to the crown.

18:17.630 --> 18:19.466
Gravity will take over
after that.

18:19.532 --> 18:22.835
Okay, nothing's scarier
than you talking science.

18:24.271 --> 18:25.805
You just worry about
one thing, all right?

18:25.872 --> 18:27.974
If I don't get enough speed
by those LEGOs,

18:28.040 --> 18:30.577
as I'm coming down here,
I need you to tell me
to bail out, all right?

18:30.643 --> 18:31.644
Got it, yep.

18:31.711 --> 18:32.779
Let's do this.

18:51.564 --> 18:54.301
(SLO-MO VOICE)
Bail out!

18:54.367 --> 18:56.703
(SLO-MO VOICE)
What?

19:05.612 --> 19:07.747
(NORMAL VOICE) You okay?
(STRAINED) Yeah.

19:07.814 --> 19:08.948
(KNOCK ON DOOR)

19:09.015 --> 19:10.250
ROOTGER: Hello!

19:10.317 --> 19:12.151
Oh. Rootger's here.

19:20.927 --> 19:22.595
The plan
should have worked.

19:22.662 --> 19:24.297
(CHUCKLES)
You really got to let it go.

19:24.364 --> 19:26.366
But we proved to him
he needs security.

19:26.433 --> 19:29.836
We got locked in his place
and basically trashed it.

19:31.103 --> 19:33.540
Should've worked.

19:33.606 --> 19:36.243
Look, the toy-store account
is gone, okay?

19:36.309 --> 19:37.344
It's just time to move on.

19:37.410 --> 19:38.711
Okay, fine.

19:38.778 --> 19:41.648
I want to re-address
the sizzle reel.

19:41.714 --> 19:42.882
Oh, my God.

19:42.949 --> 19:44.083
Listen to me.

19:44.150 --> 19:46.152
I reshot it.
Rootger is out.

19:46.219 --> 19:48.355
He was horrible.
I get it, you know.

19:48.421 --> 19:51.591
But Kyle's in now,
and he's much more natural.

19:52.124 --> 19:53.360
Really good.

19:53.426 --> 19:54.561
(KNOCK ON DOOR)

19:54.627 --> 19:57.029
Vanessa, Kevin.
Oh, Mr. Prince.

19:57.096 --> 20:00.600
I know I told you
I wasn't interested
in security,

20:00.667 --> 20:03.270
but one of my stores
was broken into last night.

20:04.337 --> 20:06.273
Whaaaat?

20:07.173 --> 20:08.908
That's terrible!

20:08.975 --> 20:11.811
It's just made me realize
that you guys were right.

20:11.878 --> 20:13.079
I need to hire you.

20:13.145 --> 20:17.450
24/7, 365, all my stores,
starting immediately.

20:17.517 --> 20:19.452
Of course, thank you.

20:19.519 --> 20:21.554
Yeah, thank you very much,
Mr. Prince.

20:21.621 --> 20:23.390
And let me say,
you are in good hands,

20:23.456 --> 20:25.592
'cause we're, we're
a very strong team,

20:25.658 --> 20:29.729
and we like to think
outside the box, yeah.

20:29.796 --> 20:30.697
Also inside the box.

20:30.763 --> 20:32.865
Yeah, but mostly...
Mostly outside.

20:32.932 --> 20:34.534
It's a balance.
It is a balance.

20:34.601 --> 20:36.168
Okay.
It's a balance.

20:36.235 --> 20:37.704
Yeah.
Thank you very much.

20:37.770 --> 20:39.739
So, my neighbor
across the street

20:39.806 --> 20:40.773
has a security cam.

20:40.840 --> 20:43.310
It takes picture
every ten minutes.

20:43.376 --> 20:45.878
We got a picture of the guy
in the act.

20:45.945 --> 20:49.816
First order of business...
Find this maniac.

20:56.723 --> 20:59.826
* Don't want no sweet perfume

20:59.892 --> 21:03.596
* Shake your thing,
go bust your move

21:03.663 --> 21:05.832
* Do, do, do, do, do

21:05.898 --> 21:07.934
* Do, do, do, do

21:08.000 --> 21:10.837
* Oh, yeah

21:10.903 --> 21:14.073
* Don't want
no high-heel shoes

21:14.140 --> 21:16.643
* I just don't want no...
