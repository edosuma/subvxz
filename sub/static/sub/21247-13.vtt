(STRAINING)

01:08.285 --> 01:10.018
Did you try pulling?

01:10.221 --> 01:11.987
Of course I tried pulling!

01:12.022 --> 01:13.122
ONO: Everyone?

01:13.157 --> 01:15.357
We've got an impatient
antelope herd back here.

01:16.026 --> 01:18.127
Seems they won't go anywhere
without Bupu.

01:18.162 --> 01:20.462
Of course not.
I am their leader.

01:21.232 --> 01:24.199
Good thing he didn't lead
the whole herd into that tree.

01:24.235 --> 01:27.069
Wait. Instead of pulling
Bupu out of the tree,

01:27.238 --> 01:29.271
why don't we just break off
the branch that's stuck?

01:29.406 --> 01:32.441
So I'll be walking around with
a branch stuck to my horns?

01:33.144 --> 01:34.376
At least you'll be
walking around.

01:34.411 --> 01:37.045
Yeah. So you can
lead your herd.

01:37.181 --> 01:38.347
Like you're supposed to.

01:38.516 --> 01:41.183
Not to mention,
it'll look great.

01:41.318 --> 01:43.118
Maybe I'll start wearing
a branch.

01:43.354 --> 01:46.321
Why don't you just see if you
can break off a piece, Bunga.

01:46.457 --> 01:47.489
You got it, Kion.

Careful!

01:51.428 --> 01:53.328
NYUNI:<i> Quit shaking my branch!</i>

01:53.364 --> 01:55.097
(GASPS) A talking tree?

01:55.132 --> 01:57.232
Can't a bird feather his nest
in peace?

01:57.434 --> 01:59.234
Oh. Just a Bird.

01:59.270 --> 02:01.203
Hey, Nyuni!
You live here now?

02:01.372 --> 02:03.438
Yes. I like to try staying

02:03.474 --> 02:05.174
in different parts
of the Savannah.

02:05.209 --> 02:07.442
And this was
a great place to live.

02:08.112 --> 02:11.280
Until someone waving around
his giant horns.

02:12.082 --> 02:14.082
Bupu, I think he means you.

02:14.118 --> 02:15.083
(GRUMBLES)

02:16.153 --> 02:18.387
Nyuni, would you mind if you
had to find a new nest?

02:18.422 --> 02:20.389
Why should I have to move
just because

02:20.424 --> 02:22.191
this big ox came along and...

02:22.226 --> 02:23.325
I am not an ox!

02:23.494 --> 02:25.994
Or maybe he's not
talking about you!

02:26.030 --> 02:27.996
Oh, I'm talking about him
all right.

02:28.032 --> 02:30.265
ZAZU: What is all this
commotion about?

02:30.301 --> 02:31.433
Oh, hey, Zazu.

02:32.036 --> 02:33.001
Kion.

02:33.470 --> 02:36.171
Hmm. An antelope
stuck in a tree...

02:36.373 --> 02:40.342
This will most definitely be
included in my Morning Report.

02:40.377 --> 02:41.376
To the King?

02:41.412 --> 02:43.378
Does he need to find out
about this?

02:43.414 --> 02:44.446
Does everyone?

02:45.049 --> 02:48.050
It is my sworn duty to keep
the King informed

02:48.085 --> 02:50.252
of all the goings-on
in the Pride Lands.

02:50.387 --> 02:53.188
No matter how bizarre
they may be.

02:53.324 --> 02:54.289
Wait.

02:54.425 --> 02:57.259
I think I know how you can
both be happy.

03:03.000 --> 03:04.399
I don't know about this.

03:05.169 --> 03:07.102
At least now you can lead
your herd again.

03:07.137 --> 03:09.972
And you get to see even more
of the Pride Lands this way.

03:10.207 --> 03:12.374
Yeah! Let's go Bupu!

03:13.010 --> 03:15.344
(GROANS)
Let's go, antelopes.

03:15.379 --> 03:17.312
Whoa! Easy!

03:18.182 --> 03:21.250
Hmm. Very original solution,
Kion.

03:21.285 --> 03:22.284
Thanks, Zazu.

03:22.319 --> 03:24.253
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I must see what else

03:24.288 --> 03:26.321
is transpiring
in the Pride Lands.

03:27.358 --> 03:30.359
Not that I imagine anything
will top this.

03:32.162 --> 03:36.098
Bupu, in the future, do try to
avoid running into trees.

03:37.034 --> 03:38.133
Thank you, Zazu.

03:39.203 --> 03:42.304
Zazu sure likes getting into
everybody's business.

03:42.506 --> 03:44.172
It's his job, Fuli.

03:44.341 --> 03:47.075
He looks out for all the
animals in the Pride Lands.

03:47.244 --> 03:48.243
Even us.

03:48.279 --> 03:50.245
Remember that time
he was after you

03:50.281 --> 03:51.413
to slow down
when we were little?

03:51.448 --> 03:53.048
Huh. Which time?

03:53.183 --> 03:56.051
The time Bunga and I
ran into the crocodiles...

03:56.387 --> 03:58.220
<i> Zuka Zama!</i>

04:04.128 --> 04:05.093
There you are!

04:05.229 --> 04:08.063
Kion, didn't your father
tell you to stay put?

04:08.232 --> 04:09.264
Aw, Zazu!

04:09.433 --> 04:11.300
Me and Bunga
are on an adventure!

04:11.335 --> 04:13.201

04:15.139 --> 04:19.174
Now see here, young cheetah.
You need to slow down!

04:19.376 --> 04:21.977
Slow down. Got it.
<i>Huwezi!</i>

04:22.279 --> 04:24.212
That's not slowing down.

04:25.049 --> 04:26.348
ZAZU: Fuli! Fuli!

04:27.384 --> 04:29.418
(BOTH LAUGHING)

04:30.054 --> 04:31.987
And as for you two...

04:33.090 --> 04:34.456
Kion? Bunga!

04:35.225 --> 04:38.060
Oh, dear!
Where have you gotten to?

04:38.228 --> 04:39.428
Adventure, here we come!

04:39.463 --> 04:41.063
Yeah!

04:41.498 --> 04:43.398
(GASPS) Crocodiles!

04:44.068 --> 04:46.234
Crocodiles? Big deal.

04:46.270 --> 04:49.404
They can't stop us.
<i> Zuka Zama!</i>

04:49.440 --> 04:51.306
Bunga? Wait for me.

04:52.042 --> 04:55.177
All right, croc-iddy crocs!
Outta the way!

04:55.346 --> 04:57.179
What's this?

04:57.214 --> 04:59.014
Looks like a snack.

05:00.117 --> 05:01.249
Careful crocodiles.

05:01.418 --> 05:03.218
You don't want to
mess with us.

05:03.253 --> 05:05.354
Who do these little ones
think they are?

05:06.056 --> 05:07.022
I'm Bunga!

05:07.224 --> 05:08.190
He's Kion!

05:08.425 --> 05:12.160
And you crocs are
in our way!

05:12.396 --> 05:15.097
(LAUGHING)

05:15.132 --> 05:16.164
Little cubs.

05:16.200 --> 05:19.034
This is crocodile territory.

05:19.236 --> 05:22.104
You should leave. Now!

05:22.339 --> 05:25.040
Unless you mean
to challenge me.

05:25.209 --> 05:27.075
Oh, yeah! That's right!

05:27.311 --> 05:30.012
You bet your bumps
I'm gonna challenge you!

05:30.381 --> 05:32.080
What does "challenge" mean?

05:34.284 --> 05:38.053
Hey! If you're messin' with
Bunga, you're messin' with me!

05:38.288 --> 05:39.421
Oh, good.

05:40.090 --> 05:42.224
Two tasty snacks
at the same time...

05:42.493 --> 05:43.458
(GULPS)

05:45.195 --> 05:46.161
Yummy!

05:46.330 --> 05:47.429
ZAZU: Enough!

05:47.464 --> 05:48.463
BOTH: Zazu?

05:48.499 --> 05:51.066
I expect it's merely
an oversight

05:51.101 --> 05:52.200
on your part, Pua.

05:53.137 --> 05:56.138
But surely you did not intend
for Makuu to eat...

05:57.074 --> 05:59.408
The son of the King?

06:00.077 --> 06:02.344
This is the son of the King?

06:03.013 --> 06:03.979
Him. Not me.

06:04.114 --> 06:06.081
I hardly think the King
would be pleased

06:06.116 --> 06:08.984
if your crocs gobbled him up
for no reason.

06:09.153 --> 06:11.019
"No reason?"

06:11.155 --> 06:14.423
These two came to our watering
hole and challenged us.

06:14.458 --> 06:17.392
We have every right
to eat them.

06:18.062 --> 06:20.095
Makuu is right, Zazu.

06:20.230 --> 06:23.165
King Simba knows
and respects our ways.

06:24.234 --> 06:25.300
Zazu?

06:25.335 --> 06:27.102
Very well, Pua.

06:27.337 --> 06:29.971
I, too, respect the
crocodile ways.

06:30.107 --> 06:34.109
But, as Kion's well-being
is my responsibility...

06:35.245 --> 06:37.412
I offer myself in his place.

06:37.448 --> 06:38.413
Huh?

06:39.016 --> 06:40.315
Un-Bunga-lievable!

06:40.350 --> 06:43.385
Though I am but a humble
adviser to King Simba,

06:43.420 --> 06:46.354
I expect I will satisfy
even the most

06:46.390 --> 06:49.091
discriminating of palates.

06:50.027 --> 06:52.194
Simba is a good and fair King.

06:52.396 --> 06:55.363
I would not want to anger him
by eating his son.

06:56.066 --> 06:58.133
Or his royal adviser.

06:58.335 --> 07:02.370
Especially one who displays
the bravery of a crocodile.

07:03.207 --> 07:04.172
(SIGHS)

07:04.441 --> 07:07.242
You three are
all free to go.

07:10.114 --> 07:12.347
Fine.
I wasn't that hungry anyway.

07:12.983 --> 07:13.949
Kion.

07:15.119 --> 07:17.285
You and your friends should
not come here uninvited again.

07:17.421 --> 07:19.254
Uh... Yes, sir!

07:19.456 --> 07:21.156
Come you two. Quickly.

07:21.291 --> 07:24.292
Back to Pride Rock before Pua
changes his mind.

07:25.229 --> 07:27.028
Huh. I forgot all about that.

07:27.197 --> 07:30.132
Zazu jumped into Makuu's mouth
to save you?

07:30.267 --> 07:31.333
That's brave.

07:32.169 --> 07:34.369
(SCOFFS)
He had to rescue you.

07:35.038 --> 07:36.004
You're the King's son.

07:36.406 --> 07:38.974
Fuli,
he was in Makuu's mouth.

07:39.243 --> 07:41.109
Not everyone
can be that brave.

07:41.311 --> 07:44.980
I'll say. And I know all about
being brave.

07:45.149 --> 07:46.414
Sure sounds like
bravery to me.

07:47.151 --> 07:48.116
Maybe.

07:50.187 --> 07:52.254
Keep an eye out for Zazu.

07:52.489 --> 07:53.455
Who-zu?

07:54.158 --> 07:55.290
The bird. Right there.

07:56.126 --> 07:57.092
(GRUNTS)

07:57.261 --> 07:59.427
All appears to be
in order here.

07:59.463 --> 08:02.931
Pathway clear,
shrubs not too pointy.

08:02.966 --> 08:05.033
That's the bird
Scar wants us to grab?

08:05.068 --> 08:06.034
Yeah.

08:06.203 --> 08:07.969
But why did he want us
to grab him?

08:08.138 --> 08:09.137
Who cares?

08:09.173 --> 08:12.040
When Scar tells me to
do something, I do it.

08:12.309 --> 08:15.343
Just like when
I tell you to
do something,

08:15.379 --> 08:16.978
you do it.

08:18.348 --> 08:20.982
(SIGHS)
Just grab the bird!

08:21.018 --> 08:22.017
(GRUNTS)

08:22.219 --> 08:23.952
(SQUAWKS)

08:25.155 --> 08:26.955
What is the meaning of this?

08:28.125 --> 08:30.325
Hyenas. I should have known.

08:30.994 --> 08:33.094
What do you think you're doing
in the Pride Lands?

08:33.297 --> 08:35.330
Actually, we're leaving
the Pride Lands.

08:36.066 --> 08:37.966
And you're coming with us.

08:38.168 --> 08:41.069
What? I most certainly am not!

08:41.271 --> 08:42.971
Grab him and let's get moving.

08:43.273 --> 08:45.173
Unmouth me, you brute!

08:45.409 --> 08:48.176
Do you have any idea who I am?

08:48.445 --> 08:51.279
Ooh, ooh! I know! I know!
You're Zazu.

08:51.448 --> 08:55.150
Yeah, and now that we've
all been properly introducted,

08:55.185 --> 08:56.218
let's go.

08:57.421 --> 08:59.054
You'll pay for this.

08:59.089 --> 09:01.189
I am adviser to the King.

09:01.225 --> 09:04.226
This is definitely making
my Morning Report.

09:06.029 --> 09:07.329
Zazu missed
the Morning Report?

09:08.065 --> 09:09.231
Zazu?

09:09.266 --> 09:10.999
That doesn't sound like him.

09:11.034 --> 09:12.234
It's never happened before.

09:12.269 --> 09:14.169
We just saw him
a little while ago.

09:14.204 --> 09:15.337
Maybe he's just late?

09:15.973 --> 09:17.973
No. It's not like him
to be late.

09:18.008 --> 09:18.974
For anything.

09:19.142 --> 09:20.942
Especially
the Morning Report.

09:21.345 --> 09:22.944
If he's not here,
then I'm afraid

09:22.980 --> 09:24.079
something could be wrong.

09:24.381 --> 09:25.347
Don't worry, Dad.

09:26.049 --> 09:27.949
We'll find him and
make sure he's okay.

09:28.185 --> 09:29.951
And I know just where
to start.

09:30.988 --> 09:33.221
No.
I haven't seen
that busybody bird

09:33.257 --> 09:34.356
since this morning.

09:35.058 --> 09:37.325
Perhaps, he's out
embarrassing some other animal

09:37.361 --> 09:39.394
who found himself in
an unfortunate situation.

09:40.030 --> 09:41.062
How about you, Nyuni?

09:41.231 --> 09:42.297
Seen anything from up there?

09:43.000 --> 09:44.432
Nope,
but I'll keep an eye out.

09:45.102 --> 09:46.067
Hey, Bupu.

09:47.137 --> 09:48.303
Looks like one of the
little ones is wandering off.

09:48.338 --> 09:49.304
Again?

09:50.007 --> 09:51.006
Good catch, Nyuni.

09:51.041 --> 09:52.007
I'll take care of it.

09:52.376 --> 09:54.276
The two of them are
getting along now?

09:54.411 --> 09:56.144
Of course we're getting along.

09:56.179 --> 09:58.079
I'm very easy
to get along with.

09:58.348 --> 10:00.282
Ah, right. Of course.

10:01.118 --> 10:02.417
Ono, scan the skies.

10:03.186 --> 10:05.253
Fuli, see if you can track him
by scent.

10:05.455 --> 10:07.255
Affirmative.
On it, Kion.

10:07.457 --> 10:09.090
(SNIFFING)

10:09.493 --> 10:11.459
And I'll make sure
he knows we're looking
for him.

10:12.162 --> 10:15.430
Zazu! We're looking for you!

10:16.066 --> 10:18.433
If Zazu doesn't hear that,
we'll know he's in trouble.

10:19.369 --> 10:22.137
(LAUGHING MANIACALLY)

10:22.439 --> 10:26.007
I fail to see
what's so funny?

10:26.176 --> 10:27.142
(LAUGHING)

10:27.344 --> 10:28.310
Really?

10:29.112 --> 10:32.180
It's funny
'cause you can't fly

10:32.215 --> 10:34.082
while you're trapped in there.

10:34.117 --> 10:36.451
(LAUGHS)
Get it?

10:38.522 --> 10:40.221
Maybe he had to be there.

10:40.457 --> 10:42.290
But he is here.

10:42.459 --> 10:45.327
Yeah.
He ain't going nowhere.

10:45.362 --> 10:47.329
(BOTH LAUGHING)

10:47.364 --> 10:50.265
Yes. So, now
that you've trapped me

10:50.300 --> 10:52.100
so cleverly.

10:52.269 --> 10:56.204
What, pray tell, is the rest
of your ingenious plan?

10:56.406 --> 10:58.473
You ain't gonna believe this,
but...

10:59.176 --> 11:00.208
We don't know.

11:02.112 --> 11:04.045
Yeah, we sure don't.

11:04.181 --> 11:06.381
We're waiting for Janja
to come back and tell us.

11:07.084 --> 11:08.183
(SIGHS)

11:08.352 --> 11:10.018
Of course, you are.

11:11.121 --> 11:12.120
Ugh.

11:13.223 --> 11:17.058
This wrongful imprisonment
will not go unanswered.

11:17.227 --> 11:19.094
Maybe we should just eat him.

11:19.129 --> 11:20.095
You think?

11:22.099 --> 11:23.398
Oh, you're thinking now?

11:24.134 --> 11:27.168
So, what would Janja think
if he returned to find

11:27.204 --> 11:28.169
that you've eaten me?

11:29.106 --> 11:31.106
Oh, yeah.
He's right.

11:31.308 --> 11:33.208
We gotta wait for Janja.

11:33.243 --> 11:34.209
Thanks, Zazu.

11:34.478 --> 11:37.312
Honestly your plan would
utterly fall apart

11:37.347 --> 11:38.446
if it were't for me.

11:39.182 --> 11:41.182
We got the bird, Scar.
So now what?

11:41.385 --> 11:43.385
Now, you get Zazu

11:43.420 --> 11:45.487
to tell you
everything he knows.

11:46.289 --> 11:48.423
And you listen.

11:49.092 --> 11:50.425
We went to
all that trouble

11:50.460 --> 11:53.328
just to listen to that
annoying, little bird?

11:53.363 --> 11:55.230
That annoying, little bird

11:55.265 --> 11:57.465
is the King's royal adviser.

11:58.068 --> 11:59.334
He knows Simba's strengths,

11:59.469 --> 12:03.138
his weaknesses,
who his allies are.

12:03.173 --> 12:06.007
In short, Zazu is keeper

12:06.042 --> 12:09.110
of all the secrets of
the Pride Lands.

12:10.080 --> 12:11.446
Oh, and if he tells us,

12:11.481 --> 12:14.983
then we know all the secrets
of the Pride Lands.

12:15.218 --> 12:17.051
And armed with that knowledge

12:17.087 --> 12:18.420
taking over the Pride Lands

12:18.455 --> 12:20.422
will be a simple matter.

12:21.258 --> 12:23.057
Even for you.

12:23.293 --> 12:26.060
Yeah, even for me.

12:26.096 --> 12:29.097
Hyenas would rule
the Pride Lands.

12:29.132 --> 12:30.198
Yes.

12:30.400 --> 12:32.200
But there's no time to waste.

12:32.235 --> 12:35.170
Zazu is very important
to the royal family.

12:35.305 --> 12:38.273
No doubt,
Kion and his Lion Guard

12:38.308 --> 12:40.341
are already looking for him.

12:41.111 --> 12:43.178
Oh, I'll get him to talk,
all right.

12:43.413 --> 12:44.479
It'll be easy.

12:44.514 --> 12:47.415
He hasn't shut that hornbill
of his since we found him.

12:49.186 --> 12:50.151
What have we here?

12:52.456 --> 12:54.389
(GASPS) Those look like
Zazu's feathers.

12:55.425 --> 12:58.092
Everyone! Everyone!
Over here.

13:00.464 --> 13:02.063
(SNIFFS)
That's Zazu, all right.

13:02.232 --> 13:03.298
There's more over here.

13:06.336 --> 13:07.335
What do you think happened?

13:08.038 --> 13:09.437
Nothing good,
that's for sure.

13:09.473 --> 13:11.339
I don't know.
Zazu's pretty old.

13:11.374 --> 13:13.174
Maybe his feathers
just fell out.

13:13.477 --> 13:15.043
I don't think so, Bunga.

13:15.178 --> 13:16.244
KION: Definitely not.

13:17.380 --> 13:20.348
And I bet it has something
to do with these hyena tracks.

13:21.418 --> 13:24.085
The hyenas
must have taken Zazu.

13:24.120 --> 13:25.153
The hyenas?

13:25.188 --> 13:27.155
What do they want with that
poor, old bird?

13:27.357 --> 13:29.090
I'm not waiting to find out.

13:29.426 --> 13:30.391
Follow me.

13:34.264 --> 13:37.165
So...
Why should
I let you go?

13:37.200 --> 13:40.435
Because,
it's the smart thing to do.

13:41.104 --> 13:43.238
And you're the smart one.

13:44.140 --> 13:45.106
Huh?

13:45.375 --> 13:48.076
Chungu,
I'll address this to you

13:48.111 --> 13:51.212
since obviously,
you are the smart one.

13:51.248 --> 13:53.081
That's what I always thought.

13:53.116 --> 13:55.216
I just didn't think of it
till now.

13:55.252 --> 13:57.352
When you said it. (GIGGLES)

13:57.387 --> 13:59.020
Hear that, Cheezi?

13:59.055 --> 14:02.257
The smart bird says
I'm the smart one.

14:02.292 --> 14:05.393
(LAUGHS)
Yeah! That makes sense.

14:06.229 --> 14:09.030
But isn't Janja
the smart one?

14:10.000 --> 14:13.101
Actually, I believe
that you both
are the smart ones.

14:13.136 --> 14:14.302
Yeah, right!

14:14.337 --> 14:17.038
(GIGGLES)
We is the smart ones!

14:17.073 --> 14:20.041
Indeed!
And the smart thing to do

14:20.076 --> 14:23.344
is to let me go
and tell Janja I escaped.

14:25.081 --> 14:27.081
Ooh, that is smart!

14:27.117 --> 14:28.416
Yeah!

14:28.451 --> 14:33.087
If we're smart, we gotta do
what the smart bird says!

14:33.256 --> 14:35.323
JANJA: Oh, no, you don't!
Oh, dear.

14:35.492 --> 14:37.325
Nice try, bird-brain.

14:37.360 --> 14:40.128
"Bird brain" (LAUGHING)

14:40.397 --> 14:42.330
Is that like a fur-brain?

14:42.365 --> 14:43.464
See what
I have to deal with?

14:44.067 --> 14:45.433
I'm beginning to.

14:46.102 --> 14:49.304
Now. You're gonna tell us
everything you know, bird.

14:49.339 --> 14:53.374
So start spilling some
royal secrets. And fast.

14:53.410 --> 14:57.445
Please. The three of you
don't scare me.

14:57.480 --> 14:58.479
(CHUCKLES)

14:59.082 --> 15:01.015
(HYENAS SNARLING)

15:07.223 --> 15:10.091
Oh...
That is a lot of hyenas.

15:10.460 --> 15:14.195
Fine. Here is what
I have to say.

15:14.230 --> 15:18.266
(SHOUTING)
If anyone can hear me,
I'm trapped in the Outlands!

15:19.169 --> 15:20.435
We already know that.

15:20.470 --> 15:23.304
Yeah. We're right here.
You don't have to shout.

15:23.340 --> 15:24.372
Ugh!

15:24.407 --> 15:26.140
We ain't got time for this!

15:26.176 --> 15:29.377
Oh, I'm sorry,
were you in a hurry?
I'll make this quick.

15:29.412 --> 15:32.413
(SHOUTING)
I'm near the Hyeya's volcano!

15:32.449 --> 15:34.115
Enough screaming!

15:34.150 --> 15:37.418
Unless you'd like me
to give you something
to scream about.

15:38.254 --> 15:43.091
Specially seeing as how
you're startin' to get me
a little steamed.

15:43.126 --> 15:44.258
(LAUGHS)

15:44.427 --> 15:46.027
Hmm?

15:46.062 --> 15:47.228

all it takes is

It was the hyenas.

21:03.112 --> 21:06.047
Yeah! But you should've
seen Zazu in action!

21:06.082 --> 21:09.317
Yeah. You took out
two hyenas to save me.

21:09.352 --> 21:13.020
Not everyone
can be that brave.
I owe you one.

21:13.156 --> 21:15.222
Oh. Thank you, Fuli.

21:15.258 --> 21:18.392
Though I wouldn't be here
if you all hadn't rescued me.

21:19.062 --> 21:21.062
In fact,
I owe all of you one.

21:21.097 --> 21:23.064
Not me. We're even.

21:23.433 --> 21:26.200
Maybe you forgot
that you saved me
from the crocs

21:26.235 --> 21:29.103
when I was a little cub.
But I never did.

21:29.138 --> 21:33.307
Ah, yes. That was
a close one, indeed.

21:33.343 --> 21:35.309
But enough reminiscing.

21:35.345 --> 21:37.345
And on
with the Morning Report!

21:37.380 --> 21:40.281
Oh, by all means,
before it's morning again.

21:40.316 --> 21:42.316
Well, it all began
this morning!

21:42.352 --> 21:46.287
After observing Kion's clever
solution for Bupu.

21:47.123 --> 21:51.158
The sight of an antelope
stuck in a tree
is quite amusing, sire.

21:51.194 --> 21:55.096
I then continued
my inspection of the path
through the grasslands,

21:55.131 --> 21:58.132
where I encountered
the hyenas.

21:58.167 --> 22:00.234
Of course we know
how that turned out,
don't we?
