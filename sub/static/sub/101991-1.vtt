[indistinct radio chatter]

00:34.208 --> 00:36.250
[tense music playing]

00:43.333 --> 00:46.541
[man 1] Uh, this is Rattlesnake.
Hostiles in the area.

00:46.625 --> 00:47.500
[man 2] Copy.

00:53.541 --> 00:55.666
-[man 1] Put the Gumps out!

[whirring and beeping]

00:57.375 --> 00:58.208
[rapid gunfire]

00:58.291 --> 00:59.666
[man 1] Let's go, let's go!

01:03.666 --> 01:06.500
[shouting]

01:07.416 --> 01:08.541
[rapid gunfire]

01:11.166 --> 01:14.833
[man 3] Jesus! IED blast ahead!
Gumps down! We cannot move forward!

01:15.333 --> 01:18.833
-[man 4] Sarge, it's a fuckin' ambush!
-[man 3] Fuck, they're everywhere!

01:21.291 --> 01:22.250
Take cover!

01:23.750 --> 01:25.000
[shouting and groaning]

01:25.916 --> 01:26.833
[groans]

01:27.916 --> 01:29.375
Take fucking shelter now!

01:30.750 --> 01:32.208
[man 5] We need to fall back!

01:32.708 --> 01:33.625
[screams]

01:33.708 --> 01:36.125
[man 1] Contact! Contact!
West side checkpoint!

01:36.208 --> 01:37.250
Man down! Over!

01:37.333 --> 01:40.708
-[man 6] Fuck! They took out the APC.
-[man 7] Sarge, we need to fall back.

01:40.791 --> 01:42.458
I'm not leaving anyone behind!

01:42.541 --> 01:44.541
[whirring]

01:45.166 --> 01:47.250
[Sgt.] Bigfoot, where are you? Over!

01:48.125 --> 01:50.333
[Bigfoot] I'm on my way.
Are we pushing through?

01:50.416 --> 01:52.291
[Sgt.] Negative. We cannot move forward.

01:52.375 --> 01:55.916
I think we lost the entire Gump unit,
and we have a man trapped. Over!

01:56.000 --> 01:57.000
[shouting]

01:57.083 --> 01:59.416
[man 8] Can't see shit!
Where the fuck are the Gumps?

01:59.500 --> 02:01.666
Gomez! Get your ass over here.

02:01.750 --> 02:03.125
[gunshots continue]

02:03.208 --> 02:06.291
-Where the fuck are they shooting from?
-They're fuckin' everywhere.

02:06.375 --> 02:09.000
-Where the fuck are the Gumps?
-[man 9] I've got you!

02:11.208 --> 02:12.500
[screaming]

02:12.583 --> 02:14.708
We need to get him out of there.
See a way through?

02:15.375 --> 02:16.333
[soldier groans]

02:16.833 --> 02:18.916
-Yes, sir.
-Okay, we'll provide covering fire.

02:19.000 --> 02:20.541
Gomez, go, go, go!

02:20.625 --> 02:22.083
-Go!
-Open fire!

02:23.000 --> 02:24.750
Contact! Covering fire now!

02:29.583 --> 02:30.916
Go, go, go, go, go!

02:31.000 --> 02:32.250
[rapid gunfire]

02:32.333 --> 02:33.416
[pants]

02:33.500 --> 02:34.625
[Gomez] Two o'clock.

02:36.125 --> 02:38.416
[Gomez] Fuck! Krasnys all over!

02:38.500 --> 02:40.083
[Bigfoot] Rattlesnake, I need cover!

02:40.166 --> 02:42.291
[Sgt.] Concentrate fire on the building.

02:43.041 --> 02:45.625
[Bigfoot] Sarge, we can't get to him!
It's too far.

02:46.208 --> 02:49.041
[Sgt.] I repeat,
I'm not leaving anyone behind.

02:49.125 --> 02:51.333
-[unintelligible]
-Let's go! Cover fire, now!

02:52.875 --> 02:53.916
Go!

02:55.000 --> 02:57.041
-Contact right!
-[shouting and gunfire]

02:59.583 --> 03:00.541
[screams]

03:01.041 --> 03:02.791
-[Sgt.] Cover!
-Contact!

03:05.500 --> 03:06.791
-Go!
-Bigfoot!

03:07.666 --> 03:09.208
[Sgt.] Cover fire, now!

03:10.416 --> 03:11.875
[rapid fire]

03:11.958 --> 03:13.541
[tense music playing]

03:15.333 --> 03:17.208
-Now!
-[Bigfoot] Reloading!

03:18.208 --> 03:19.541
Cover!

03:21.750 --> 03:22.958
[Sgt.] Bigfoot!

03:23.041 --> 03:24.583
[groans] I'm hit!

03:25.958 --> 03:27.500
[man 11] Man down! Man down!

03:30.625 --> 03:32.541
[atmospheric music plays]

03:37.958 --> 03:41.000
[Bigfoot] Rattlesnake, come on.
I need cover. I'm hit!

03:41.083 --> 03:43.166
[Sgt.] This is Rattlesnake.
I hear you loud and clear.

03:43.250 --> 03:45.541
-We'll be there. Stay where you are.
-Rattlesnake,

03:46.291 --> 03:47.500
this is Rolling Thunder.

03:48.041 --> 03:50.458
Unidentified vehicle
approaching at high speed.

03:50.541 --> 03:53.000
Potential attack.
Requesting permission to engage.

03:54.541 --> 03:56.583
Hold on. I got you, buddy. Come on.

03:57.750 --> 03:59.875
Permission denied. Two of our men trapped.

04:03.500 --> 04:04.958
[rapid gunfire]

04:05.833 --> 04:07.291
[beeping]

04:07.375 --> 04:09.125
We have an additional
38 men on the ground.

04:09.208 --> 04:11.916
They're a priority.
I need you to fall back. Over.

04:12.000 --> 04:13.125
Let me get my men out!

04:14.500 --> 04:16.541
Bale, confirm Hellfire
with Captain Brydon.

04:16.625 --> 04:19.458
Yes, sir. Base, this is Rolling Thunder,

04:19.541 --> 04:22.166
requesting permission for air strike.
Over.

04:22.250 --> 04:24.125
-I need Sector 9.
-Here, sir.

04:24.208 --> 04:27.000
[tense music continues]

04:27.958 --> 04:29.333
-Put it up.
-Yes, sir.

04:29.416 --> 04:30.708
Rattlesnake, I need that cover!

04:30.791 --> 04:32.041
Do you copy?

04:32.125 --> 04:34.458
Stay there, hold position.
We'll come get you.

04:35.041 --> 04:37.166
Rattlesnake,
I need you to fall back, over.

04:37.250 --> 04:39.666
[Sgt.] I repeat!
Two of our men trapped! Over!

04:39.750 --> 04:40.583
Amber Base,

04:40.666 --> 04:43.708
this is Rolling Thunder.
Do I have permission to engage?

04:43.791 --> 04:46.000
I have a heavily armored truck,
broad wheelbase.

04:46.083 --> 04:48.291
-High risk, mobile launcher.
-Rolling Thunder,

04:48.375 --> 04:50.083
this is Amber Base, hold for command.

04:52.166 --> 04:54.250
Truck's too close to our men
to risk Hellfire.

04:54.333 --> 04:55.625
[gunfire continues]

04:56.208 --> 04:58.958
Rattlesnake, do you copy?
I'm getting fucking hit down here!

04:59.041 --> 05:01.208
[rapid fire]

05:03.208 --> 05:04.666
[grunts] Come on!

05:06.291 --> 05:09.208
[Sgt.] All right, Fire team,
prepare for cover fire.

05:09.291 --> 05:11.458
That's a launch-- That's a launcher, sir.

05:11.541 --> 05:12.375
Over.

05:13.166 --> 05:14.875
No launcher visible in my feed.

05:15.458 --> 05:17.791
-Fire request denied.
-I'm positive that's a launcher, sir.

05:17.875 --> 05:19.333
Impact is imminent. Over.

05:19.416 --> 05:20.541
You heard him!

05:20.625 --> 05:21.958
Hold fire till I clear my men!

05:22.041 --> 05:23.208
We have 38 men on ground,

05:23.291 --> 05:25.083
plus two exposed. They'll all die.

05:25.166 --> 05:26.166
It's not your call.

05:26.250 --> 05:27.916
[Bigfoot] Rattlesnake, do you copy?

05:28.000 --> 05:29.958
-I'm getting fucking hit here!
-[Bale] Harp?

05:30.041 --> 05:32.458
[Sgt.] We'll be there! Stay where you are!

05:32.541 --> 05:34.000
Let's get those two Marines.

05:34.083 --> 05:35.541
-Go!
-[shouting]

05:35.625 --> 05:37.083
Go! Moving out!

05:37.166 --> 05:38.500
Let's get them! Let's go!

05:39.083 --> 05:40.208
West flank, be ready!

05:42.458 --> 05:43.416
Danger close.

05:44.083 --> 05:45.666
-[beeping]
-[Harp] Target locked.

05:45.750 --> 05:47.583
-Goddammit!
-Abort, abort!

05:47.666 --> 05:49.708
-[Sgt.] Take cover.
-Stand down.

05:49.791 --> 05:51.875
-What are you doing, Harp?
-[beeping]

05:51.958 --> 05:53.291
DA1 off the rail on three…

05:53.375 --> 05:55.125
-Stand down.
-[beeping]

05:55.208 --> 05:56.291
-[Harp] …two,
-[sighs]

05:57.416 --> 05:58.666
-…one.
-[beeping]

06:01.583 --> 06:02.916
Incoming!

06:06.708 --> 06:08.083
[screams]

06:09.125 --> 06:10.375
[screams]

06:16.958 --> 06:18.041
Goddammit, Harp!

06:21.708 --> 06:24.291
[indistinct radio chatter]

06:24.375 --> 06:25.666
[breathes heavily]

06:25.750 --> 06:26.875
What the fuck, Harp?

06:27.375 --> 06:28.875
You disobeyed a direct order.

06:29.583 --> 06:31.125
[Sgt.] You son of a bitch!

06:32.208 --> 06:33.291
You killed 'em!

06:36.041 --> 06:37.500
You killed 'em!

06:39.791 --> 06:43.375
[intense music playing]

07:03.666 --> 07:05.000
[Brydon] Two US Marines.

07:06.125 --> 07:06.958
Dead.

07:08.500 --> 07:10.833
And one US Army Gump destroyed.

07:16.625 --> 07:19.500
I made the call that felt most correct
given the intel available--

07:19.583 --> 07:20.666
[Brydon] At the time.

07:21.250 --> 07:22.083
We know.

07:22.791 --> 07:26.208
With all due respect, Captain,
with 40 men on the ground, I saved 38,

07:26.291 --> 07:28.666
including Master Sergeant Miller
and his convoy.

07:28.750 --> 07:32.208
If Miller had been given the chance,
he would've tried to save all 40.

07:33.291 --> 07:35.250
But you took that option away from him.

07:39.083 --> 07:40.500
When did you do your basic?

07:41.250 --> 07:42.666
Three years ago. Parris Island.

07:42.750 --> 07:44.833
Have you ever experienced
a mass-casualty encounter,

07:44.916 --> 07:46.708
other than from behind your screen?

07:50.291 --> 07:52.541
Have you spent time
in a conflict zone, Harp?

07:52.625 --> 07:55.208
-No, ma'am, but I--
-Thank you, Lieutenant.

07:56.750 --> 07:58.291
Here's your deployment drive.

08:01.875 --> 08:04.250
Captain, this can't be the only option.

08:04.333 --> 08:06.000
They wanted to court-martial you.

08:06.083 --> 08:08.458
-I fought for you.
-What am I gonna tell Olivia?

08:08.541 --> 08:10.875
Tell her you're going on
an all-expenses-paid refresher

08:10.958 --> 08:12.500
in how to make the world a safer place.

08:12.583 --> 08:14.958
-Until when?
-Until you pass the assessment.

08:15.041 --> 08:16.541
And when's that gonna be?

08:20.416 --> 08:21.750
When's that gonna be, sir?

08:23.916 --> 08:25.208
I like you, Harp.

08:25.291 --> 08:27.416
You're precise, efficient.
Brilliant drone pilot.

08:28.000 --> 08:29.791
But you disobeyed a direct order.

08:30.291 --> 08:32.083
Consider yourself lucky today.

08:32.791 --> 08:35.375
Your CO at Camp Nathaniel
is a Captain Leo.

08:36.250 --> 08:37.208
Report to him.

08:39.750 --> 08:42.583
Camp Nathaniel?
That's where the platoon's based.

08:42.666 --> 08:44.416
Keep your head down.
See it as an opportunity

08:44.500 --> 08:46.083
to meet your fellow servicemen.

08:46.750 --> 08:48.791
Let's pray you're a fast learner.

08:48.875 --> 08:49.791
Dismissed.

08:57.791 --> 09:00.125
[whirring]

09:05.208 --> 09:07.791
-[buzzer]
-[man 1] Let's go, guys. Let's get moving!

09:07.875 --> 09:09.458
Straight ahead, straight ahead.

09:10.458 --> 09:13.875
Move it, soldier.
This is your new home, maggots.

09:14.583 --> 09:17.083
Get into three separate lines
to get scanned in.

09:17.166 --> 09:20.500
-Pronto! Double-time! Move!
-[aircraft roars overhead]

09:20.583 --> 09:21.791
Welcome to Camp Nathaniel.

09:21.875 --> 09:24.000
You'll be seeing a lot of my pretty face.

09:24.083 --> 09:26.166
Get scanned in by the Gumps
and keep it moving.

09:26.250 --> 09:28.916
Your digs are in Sections 2 and 4,
ahead on your left.

09:29.000 --> 09:30.208
Keep it moving, soldier.

09:30.291 --> 09:32.583
Let's go. What are you waiting for?

09:32.666 --> 09:33.708
Come on! Don't be shy.

09:33.791 --> 09:36.041
-[beeping]
-Look at them straight in the eye.

09:36.125 --> 09:37.708
-Do not hesitate.
-[Gump beeps]

09:37.791 --> 09:41.583
[man 1] They smell fear, boys.
Keep it moving, soldiers. Come on!

09:41.666 --> 09:45.208
Hey, eyes on the prize, soldier.
Eyes on the prize. Come on.

09:45.291 --> 09:48.958
Left foot, right foot, keep it going.
Why are you being so slow? Come on!

09:49.041 --> 09:51.541
Excuse me.
Hi, I'm looking for Captain Leo.

09:52.791 --> 09:54.833
-Sorry. I'm looking for Captain Leo.
-Leo?

09:54.916 --> 09:58.125
Oh man. I don't know.
You better talk to Colonel Eckhart.

09:58.208 --> 10:00.666
-He's by the medical tent right there.
-Thank you.

10:02.083 --> 10:02.916
[growling]

10:03.000 --> 10:06.666
[man 1] Hey! I am not gonna let my men
be out on inspection here. Move!

10:06.750 --> 10:08.708
[man 2] Make room. Got another one coming.

10:08.791 --> 10:10.041
[Harp] Colonel Eckhart?

10:11.291 --> 10:12.500
Lieutenant Harp, sir.

10:12.583 --> 10:15.750
Posted here from Creech Air Force Base.
Looking for Captain Leo.

10:15.833 --> 10:18.833
[laughs] You must've really fucked up
if they sent you to Leo.

10:18.916 --> 10:20.333
What do you mean, sir?

10:20.416 --> 10:22.791
You don't have permission to speak
until I ask you a question.

10:24.375 --> 10:26.250
You even know why you're here?

10:26.333 --> 10:29.291
-Experientum Auctoriat, sir.
-"Authority of experience."

10:29.375 --> 10:31.958
Don't give it a Latin name, shit.
Explain it to me.

10:32.583 --> 10:35.041
Uh, it's an Ethics Committee dictate, sir.

10:35.125 --> 10:39.083
It proposes UAV pilots would exercise
greater caution if they experienced--

10:39.166 --> 10:41.458
The Ethics Committee is a PR team.

10:41.541 --> 10:44.541
This dictate is a bullshit pass
for pilots who fuck up.

10:45.166 --> 10:47.416
You killed two marines.
You should be in jail.

10:49.500 --> 10:51.916
Someone deemed
the dollar value of your training

10:52.000 --> 10:54.541
to be higher than the lives
of those two men.

10:54.625 --> 10:57.291
If you survive, Air Force keeps a pilot.

10:57.791 --> 11:01.875
You don't, you're a cautionary tale
to all the other fly-by-wire assholes.

11:03.125 --> 11:06.250
-With all due respect, sir--
-I didn't ask you a question, son.

11:13.750 --> 11:16.375
Block 13. Follow the music.

11:18.583 --> 11:19.750
Thank you, Colonel.

11:21.375 --> 11:22.208
[Eckhart] Harp…

11:23.416 --> 11:24.875
…he's not like us.

11:26.458 --> 11:28.583
[mechanical footsteps]

11:37.500 --> 11:39.083
[man] This is ridiculous.

11:40.666 --> 11:43.041
Can you believe
we have to read all this and file it?

11:56.375 --> 11:57.916
[door creaks]

11:58.000 --> 11:58.875
[loud clang]

11:59.500 --> 12:00.333
Shh!

12:01.208 --> 12:02.250
Be quiet!

12:17.791 --> 12:20.666
[Gump whirs]

12:22.125 --> 12:24.125
[whirs and beeps]

12:39.791 --> 12:44.125
[female announcer] Remaining charging time
for Gump unit C-45, 20 minutes.

12:49.250 --> 12:52.541
[muffled music plays]

12:52.625 --> 12:56.791
["Stars Fell On Alabama"
by Ella Fitzgerald &amp; Louis Armstrong]

13:00.625 --> 13:01.833
Are you Captain Leo?

13:02.833 --> 13:06.333
[jazz song continues]

13:17.125 --> 13:19.583
[man hums]

13:20.250 --> 13:22.000
[scatting on record]

13:22.083 --> 13:25.958
[hums along quietly]

13:26.041 --> 13:27.291
Lieutenant Harp, sir.

13:29.625 --> 13:32.041
[continues humming]

13:35.250 --> 13:37.083
-My deployment drive, sir.
-Shh!

13:39.458 --> 13:42.750
-[hums]
-[music fades]

13:47.916 --> 13:51.791
[keyboard clicks]

13:55.041 --> 13:56.625
Lieutenant Thomas Harp.

13:57.500 --> 13:59.250
Tier three UAV pilot,

13:59.333 --> 14:02.083
56,000 flight hours,

14:02.166 --> 14:05.333
99% performance record,
and 99% discipline.

14:05.416 --> 14:09.333
Engaged to Olivia Rose Meyer of Carlsbad.

14:10.333 --> 14:12.333
To be married in Palm Springs.

14:12.916 --> 14:14.791
It's a very nice part of the world.

14:15.458 --> 14:18.125
Did I leave anything out
other than your kills and commendations

14:18.208 --> 14:20.458
or the fact
that you can't appreciate culture,

14:20.541 --> 14:22.916
or you just don't know
when to shut the fuck up?

14:24.166 --> 14:25.875
-No.
-No, Captain.

14:25.958 --> 14:26.958
No, Captain.

14:27.041 --> 14:28.000
[Leo] Very good.

14:29.333 --> 14:31.666
How many insurgents have you killed, Harp?

14:31.750 --> 14:33.708
-163.
-Collateral?

14:34.833 --> 14:37.833
My numbers are consistent
with mission goals and flight hours, sir.

14:37.916 --> 14:39.875
Your numbers? [chuckles]

14:40.333 --> 14:43.666
Goddamn, you a cold motherfucker. [laughs]

14:44.750 --> 14:45.583
Here.

14:47.125 --> 14:48.541
Grab that and follow me.

14:54.625 --> 14:57.333
Far too many names
to memorize and recite, sir.

14:58.125 --> 15:00.708
If you could, would you really want to?

15:01.875 --> 15:03.583
I'm aware we kill people, Captain.

15:03.666 --> 15:05.833
If you were aware of that,
you wouldn't be here.

15:09.083 --> 15:10.291
You a quartermaster?

15:11.375 --> 15:12.250
If I were…

15:13.208 --> 15:14.333
would you be disappointed?

15:15.125 --> 15:18.583
-Why would I be disappointed?
-'Cause that means you flew 10,000 miles

15:18.666 --> 15:20.375
to sign equipment out of a warehouse.

15:21.500 --> 15:22.750
We all play our part.

15:22.833 --> 15:24.541
The fuck do you think you are?

15:25.125 --> 15:26.291
Some Academy kid?

15:27.166 --> 15:30.791
Daddy pay your way through cadet school
so you could mind your Ps and Qs?

15:32.666 --> 15:36.625
With all due respect,
I put myself through cadet school.

15:41.666 --> 15:42.500
Sir.

15:45.000 --> 15:45.833
No.

15:48.750 --> 15:50.083
No what, Captain?

15:50.166 --> 15:51.958
[Leo] No, I'm not a quartermaster.

15:53.166 --> 15:55.416
We have to deliver
these vaccines to a clinic.

15:56.000 --> 15:57.791
Twenty klicks outside the wire.

15:58.291 --> 16:01.666
There's an outbreak of cholera,
and it's spreading fast.

16:02.541 --> 16:05.791
It might be a war zone,
but women and children still get sick.

16:07.166 --> 16:08.875
So you're "hearts and minds," sir?

16:08.958 --> 16:10.750
Yes. I'm hearts and minds.

16:11.250 --> 16:13.250
Ostensibly. [chuckles lightly]

16:13.333 --> 16:14.666
So, what do you really do?

16:15.708 --> 16:16.791
I chase ghosts.

16:18.500 --> 16:20.208
-I'm sorry, what?
-[Leo chuckles]

16:20.291 --> 16:23.541
MARSOC. Marine Special Operations.

16:23.625 --> 16:28.250
I locate and remove advanced weapons
from insurgents beyond the wire.

16:30.416 --> 16:33.291
And what do you do?
Put them in filing cabinets?

16:33.375 --> 16:35.583
It's the latest
in counter-intel technology.

16:35.666 --> 16:38.166
Beats the hell out
of those Russian hackers.

16:39.500 --> 16:40.500
It's your NDA.

16:41.416 --> 16:44.416
-You can sign it or read all 90 pages.
-Oh. No, sir.

16:50.000 --> 16:50.916
Welcome, Lieutenant.

16:53.666 --> 16:55.916
You ever heard the name Viktor Koval?

16:57.416 --> 17:01.208
Yeah. Heard insurgents say it
on intercepted radio comms.

17:01.291 --> 17:04.458
Forget what you heard in the air.
You're on the ground now, kid.

17:05.625 --> 17:08.000
Viktor Koval is a Krasny warlord.

17:09.375 --> 17:12.875
The Krasny wanna make
the Ukraine a part of Russia.

17:13.958 --> 17:16.375
-[Harp] Like in the good old days.
-Opposing them

17:16.916 --> 17:18.125
are the Resistance.

17:18.208 --> 17:21.750
They're a militia set up to defend
the independence of the Ukraine.

17:21.833 --> 17:25.458
But the Krasnys are getting stronger
with the full support of Moscow.

17:25.541 --> 17:27.750
It's a war that's got too hot for the UN,

17:27.833 --> 17:30.541
so now we're the assholes
in the middle of it,

17:30.625 --> 17:32.333
in the demilitarized zone.

17:33.166 --> 17:34.291
We're peacekeepers.

17:34.916 --> 17:38.166
We're the only thing stopping these guys
from committing genocide.

17:38.250 --> 17:41.041
You believe that, I have a timeshare
in Florida I want to sell you.

17:42.333 --> 17:46.791
No, we're talking about Viktor Koval,
the Terror of the Balkans.

17:52.083 --> 17:52.916
And nukes.

17:55.208 --> 17:56.041
Nukes?

17:56.833 --> 18:00.083
There's Intel that says
Koval is responsible for the dirty bomb

18:00.166 --> 18:01.291
set off in Kiev,

18:02.041 --> 18:03.500
using Russian uranium.

18:04.000 --> 18:07.166
This motherfucker may be responsible
for 25,000 people's deaths.

18:07.750 --> 18:10.625
My sources tell me he's trying
to get to Systema Perimeter.

18:11.291 --> 18:13.083
Systema Perimeter?

18:13.166 --> 18:15.875
That's Russia's
automated nuclear retaliation system.

18:16.625 --> 18:17.750
[Leo] Exactly.

18:17.833 --> 18:20.083
Even after Ukraine's independence,

18:20.166 --> 18:23.458
the country still held one-third
of Russia's nuclear arsenal.

18:23.541 --> 18:27.041
Silos scattered across the country
at top-secret locations,

18:27.125 --> 18:29.541
ready to strike anywhere in the world.

18:33.708 --> 18:34.583
Yeah.

18:35.083 --> 18:38.666
But it was shut down like 50 years ago,
after the Cold War.

18:38.750 --> 18:39.750
You believe that?

18:40.708 --> 18:44.750
You really think Russia would dismantle
its one true safeguard against attack?

18:45.333 --> 18:48.666
You telling me
the Russian systems are still functioning?

18:49.250 --> 18:50.125
And Koval…

18:51.458 --> 18:53.875
he's trying to get
to the nukes here in Ukraine?

18:53.958 --> 18:57.208
CIA sources say that
the Kremlin's lost control of Koval.

18:57.791 --> 19:00.958
My informant believes
Koval's gonna make a move for those nukes

19:01.041 --> 19:02.291
in the next 24 hours.

19:03.375 --> 19:05.208
And if all this is true,

19:05.291 --> 19:08.208
imagine what he'll do
if he gets his hands on those silos.

19:08.291 --> 19:09.833
Yeah. A madman with nukes.

19:09.916 --> 19:12.166
A crazy terrorist with nukes.

19:12.250 --> 19:15.750
Downtown Washington,
New York, Paris. Who knows?

19:15.833 --> 19:19.833
What I do know is, there won't be
a pretty little wedding in Palm Springs,

19:19.916 --> 19:22.875
unless you're wearing
factor 500 UV protection.

19:26.458 --> 19:29.041
Now, we deliver
these vaccines to the hospital,

19:29.125 --> 19:32.166
and my informant will
feed us intel on Koval's next plan.

19:32.750 --> 19:34.000
We ride out at dawn.

19:34.958 --> 19:35.791
Dawn?

19:36.291 --> 19:38.166
But that's… now!

19:38.250 --> 19:39.750
Whoa, uh, Captain.

19:39.833 --> 19:40.916
Uh, Sir?

19:43.458 --> 19:46.125
With all due respect, sir,
I think there's been a mistake.

19:46.208 --> 19:47.291
I just got here.

19:47.375 --> 19:49.416
[Leo] I don't make mistakes, Lieutenant.

19:49.500 --> 19:51.625
[Harp] No, I don't mean it like that, sir.

19:56.375 --> 19:58.458
Dress, Lieutenant. Double-time.

19:59.125 --> 20:00.166
What's this?

20:00.750 --> 20:03.291
You wear your uniform,
you'll be a standing target.

20:07.583 --> 20:10.166
-Thought I'd be guarding the fence, sir.
-[chuckles]

20:11.291 --> 20:13.958
I don't have any specialist training
as a field agent.

20:14.458 --> 20:17.666
Don't worry.
I'm special enough for both of us.

20:19.833 --> 20:21.833
[buzzing]

20:28.583 --> 20:29.416
What the fuck?

20:29.500 --> 20:31.083
What the fuck, Captain.

20:35.791 --> 20:37.875
-You're a--
-Your commanding officer.

20:37.958 --> 20:39.291
Fourth-generation biotech,

20:39.375 --> 20:41.916
and I'm gonna give you
60 seconds to deal with it.

20:45.333 --> 20:47.791
I'm-- I'm sorry, what, Captain?
[clears throat]

20:48.833 --> 20:51.041
Do you feel as though
you can trust me, Harp?

20:51.625 --> 20:54.000
-I, uh--
-[Leo] We're about to enter a war zone.

20:54.083 --> 20:56.666
If I continue
to instill shock and distrust,

20:56.750 --> 20:58.625
I'll file your removal papers myself,

20:58.708 --> 21:01.375
and you'll have to deal
with the consequences.

21:01.958 --> 21:04.875
[solemn music playing]

21:10.666 --> 21:11.500
Now…

21:12.708 --> 21:13.833
do you trust me?

21:15.708 --> 21:16.625
Yes, sir.

21:20.708 --> 21:21.583
Cool.

21:29.125 --> 21:30.833
So, what are you? Like, AI?

21:30.916 --> 21:34.083
Your cell phone's AI. A Gump's AI.

21:35.000 --> 21:37.250
I'm a prototype.
My existence is classified.

21:37.333 --> 21:39.166
You're evading the question, sir.

21:39.250 --> 21:42.250
[Leo] Ask the right question,
I'll give you the right answer.

21:42.333 --> 21:44.750
-[soldier laughs]
-[man] Go again?

21:44.833 --> 21:47.125
Okay. What the hell are you?

21:49.083 --> 21:51.291
You want my model number or tech specs?

21:51.375 --> 21:52.500
Both are classified.

21:52.583 --> 21:54.208
-[soldiers laugh]
-Yo!

21:54.791 --> 21:55.666
Oh, ten-hut!

21:57.208 --> 21:58.916
The fuck are you doing?

21:59.000 --> 22:02.333
Some asshole in Arlington thinks
a vending machine can do a soldier's job.

22:05.583 --> 22:08.333
-Aside from that, it's got a fucked rotor.
-[Gump beeps]

22:08.416 --> 22:11.666
You want me to take the butt of my gun
and bash your ugly fucking mug in?

22:14.375 --> 22:15.291
[Gump beeps]

22:15.375 --> 22:16.208
No, sir.

22:17.083 --> 22:18.291
Charlie Nine.

22:18.375 --> 22:20.375
-[Gump beeps and whirs]
-[Leo] Mount up.

22:21.500 --> 22:23.000
This way, Lieutenant.

22:23.583 --> 22:26.250
Only two people have clearance
to know who and what I am.

22:26.333 --> 22:27.875
Colonel Eckhart and you.

22:27.958 --> 22:32.000
Why was I assigned to you?
I'm not qualified to go chasing nukes.

22:32.083 --> 22:33.333
You weren't assigned.

22:33.916 --> 22:34.875
I chose you.

22:35.791 --> 22:38.083
I can't do this alone.
I need eyes on my back.

22:39.083 --> 22:41.791
I needed someone
who could think outside the box.

22:46.875 --> 22:47.750
You got me?

22:50.541 --> 22:51.666
So, we're partners?

22:52.833 --> 22:53.666
Fuck, no.

22:55.875 --> 22:57.208
You're my subordinate.

22:59.291 --> 23:01.833
You respect me like the rest
of your commanding officers.

23:01.916 --> 23:04.583
Don't question my authority,
and we'll get on fine.

23:05.750 --> 23:07.083
Our jeep's over there.

23:08.416 --> 23:09.708
[indistinct yelling]

23:09.791 --> 23:11.416
-Captain.
-At ease, soldier.

23:12.416 --> 23:13.500
[scoffs] Subordinate.

23:18.500 --> 23:19.875
-Hey, drone boy!
-Come here.

23:20.458 --> 23:22.500
Hey! What the-- [groans]

23:22.583 --> 23:25.333
-[soldiers grunt]
-[Harp groans]

23:26.000 --> 23:27.208
Stand down!

23:29.666 --> 23:30.958
You made your point.

23:32.333 --> 23:34.500
[Harp breathes heavily]

23:38.541 --> 23:40.833
You recognize my voice,
you son of a bitch?

23:43.583 --> 23:45.291
They were only 19 years old.

23:47.541 --> 23:49.625
Nothing I say will bring them back.

24:02.625 --> 24:04.125
What are you staring at?

24:05.041 --> 24:05.875
Load up.

24:05.958 --> 24:08.291
[propulsive music plays]

24:09.500 --> 24:12.083
[man] Report of hostile activities
in Sector 9.

24:12.166 --> 24:15.875
[radio chatter continues]

24:27.250 --> 24:29.375
Eleven miles to the city.

24:29.916 --> 24:32.958
We don't control
any of the area outside the wire.

24:33.541 --> 24:35.041
[buzzer sounds]

24:37.875 --> 24:40.208
-The Marines call it--
-"Running the gauntlet."

24:41.833 --> 24:43.708
Because attacks in it are so frequent.

24:43.791 --> 24:45.458
[chuckles] Good.

24:46.041 --> 24:48.125
-[radio beeps]
-[Miller] All units be advised.

24:48.208 --> 24:50.416
We are proceeding outside the wire.

24:54.583 --> 24:56.458
[Leo] Pick up your rifle, Lieutenant.

24:56.541 --> 24:59.541
If they attack,
you're gonna need to shoot back.

25:03.625 --> 25:04.541
[breathes heavily]

25:05.666 --> 25:08.083
[tense music playing]

25:25.375 --> 25:26.291
[breathes heavily]

25:30.666 --> 25:32.458
[radio chatter]

25:32.541 --> 25:33.625
Must be nice.

25:34.166 --> 25:37.333
Fight a war, never have to leave home.

25:37.416 --> 25:39.541
[breathes deeply]

25:39.625 --> 25:41.458
When was the last time you saw her?

25:42.875 --> 25:44.833
-Saw who?
-What do you mean "who"?

25:44.916 --> 25:46.500
Olivia Rose Meyer.

25:48.500 --> 25:49.416
Last week.

25:49.916 --> 25:51.375
[Leo] Last week. Damn.

25:54.333 --> 25:57.958
[aircraft roars overhead]

26:01.125 --> 26:03.750
-You fucking somebody else?
-Get the fuck outta here.

26:03.833 --> 26:06.416
Come on. Look,
I get a sense of arrogance from you.

26:06.916 --> 26:09.625
Guys like you, so dispassionate, so cold,

26:09.708 --> 26:11.166
so into himself.

26:11.958 --> 26:15.500
-Those are the guys that usually wander.
-Yeah? Well, I'm faithful.

26:15.583 --> 26:17.791
-She faithful to you?
-Yeah. She is--

26:18.291 --> 26:20.666
[scoffs] Why am I even
having this conversation?

26:20.750 --> 26:21.875
Fair game, rookie.

26:22.791 --> 26:27.000
I need your head out here,
not thinking about if Olivia's at home

26:27.083 --> 26:29.875
playing "put the beef in my taco"
with her Pilates instructor.

26:29.958 --> 26:33.666
-Her Pilates instructor's a woman.
-Oh, even better!

26:33.750 --> 26:37.250
-She goes both ways. I knew I liked her.
-We're getting married in September.

26:37.333 --> 26:40.750
What do you know about relationships?
Aren't you like three years old?

26:41.250 --> 26:42.083
Five.

26:44.458 --> 26:45.958
You got a picture of her?

26:46.958 --> 26:48.500
Come on, man. Pull it out.

[Harp sighs]

26:54.000 --> 26:54.916
Holy shit.

26:55.000 --> 26:56.958
She's a hottie. Congratulations.

26:57.041 --> 26:58.791
-Thank you. She's special.
-Hey!

26:59.916 --> 27:02.958
"My Gummy Bear." [chuckles]
She calls you Gummy Bear?

27:03.666 --> 27:06.583

-[Miller] This is Rattlesnake.

27:18.875 --> 27:20.875
We've been moved up to Yellow alert.

27:21.791 --> 27:24.000
-So, eyes open. Over.
-[radio beeps]

27:26.333 --> 27:29.958
[Leo] Look at these poor bastards.
Stuck between us and Koval.

27:30.750 --> 27:33.166
[man] I got a bunch of civilians.
Nine o'clock.

27:35.750 --> 27:37.541
No signs of hostile activity.

27:44.375 --> 27:45.541
Keep your distance.

27:48.250 --> 27:49.791
[Miller] This is Rattlesnake.

27:49.875 --> 27:53.750
We have reports from base
of aid truck hit. Man down.

27:53.833 --> 27:55.833
Repeat. Aid truck hit.

27:55.916 --> 27:57.250
Road to encampment blocked.

27:57.833 --> 27:59.250

Listen, put the Gumps out.
Form a perimeter

[Leo sighs]

29:34.125 --> 29:35.833
I said hold fire, goddammit!

-Step away! Back!

29:53.166 --> 29:55.833
Captain, just a sec, sir. Sir?

29:55.916 --> 29:56.916
[marine] Cooperate!

29:58.083 --> 30:00.291

[marine] Stand down!
Put your weapons down.

30:04.708 --> 30:07.916

30:43.125 --> 30:44.125

30:51.750 --> 30:53.916
-Okay, all right.
-[shouting]

[shouting quietens]

30:59.833 --> 31:01.916
All right. I'm unarmed.

31:02.541 --> 31:04.458

Come on.

31:10.708 --> 31:11.625
[breathes deeply]

31:23.166 --> 31:26.416
[Leo] You gotta move this truck,
we gotta get our men out of here.

-What do you want?
-[Harp breathes heavily]

31:30.708 --> 31:32.541
[intense music]

31:33.375 --> 31:35.833
[Leo] We don't want to fight.
You understand?

31:42.291 --> 31:43.208
Okay?

31:43.291 --> 31:45.708
-What the fuck?
-[marine] What's he doing?

-[Leo] All right.
-[man shouts in Ukrainian]

32:02.208 --> 32:03.458

32:03.541 --> 32:06.375
Get your men off the street.
Let's get that truck moved.

32:06.458 --> 32:07.625
-Fuck, yeah.
-Copy that.

32:07.708 --> 32:09.083
-I'm sorry.
-[marine] Relax!

32:09.166 --> 32:11.666
-Go get those Marines.
-What did you say to him?

32:11.750 --> 32:13.833
[Leo]
Said we had to get vaccines through.

32:13.916 --> 32:16.541
-Is that all it took?
-No, I gave him the aid truck.

32:17.166 --> 32:20.000
[scoffs] They had weapons, though.
They weren't after food.

32:20.083 --> 32:21.875
-They were militia.
-[Miller] Easy.

32:22.375 --> 32:23.791
They can't be both?

32:23.875 --> 32:25.750
It's our job to identify, neutralize.

32:25.833 --> 32:28.541
It's our job to stay alive
long enough to get our intel

32:28.625 --> 32:30.291
and focus on the bigger picture.

32:30.375 --> 32:33.458
-We gotta get to the clinic.
-[Miller] Keep your eyes open.

32:37.291 --> 32:39.125
-He's gone.
-[Miller] Check right.

32:39.625 --> 32:41.041

-[Miller] Easy, easy.

32:48.583 --> 32:49.625
Nice and slow.

Just like that. We all go--

32:55.791 --> 32:57.166

[indistinct yelling]

33:23.083 --> 33:24.083
Take cover!

33:24.166 --> 33:27.791
Try and concentrate fire on the building.
Flush them out into the open.

33:30.375 --> 33:31.791
[Marine 2] Got 'em! Stand down!

33:36.250 --> 33:37.375
[Marine 3] Cover me!

33:49.458 --> 33:50.791
All right. Fire team…

We gotta make it to our contact!

We're gonna go ahead on foot!

34:40.208 --> 34:43.000
-You get that vaccine delivered.
-Okay.

One, two, go!

[birds tweet]

35:18.875 --> 35:20.750
[Harp] That was Koval's men attacking us?

35:20.833 --> 35:24.875
[Leo] Yeah, they hit the supply truck
and waited for the locals to go for food.

35:25.458 --> 35:28.583
Koval's getting closer.
Popping up like a game of whack-a-mole.

35:30.541 --> 35:31.750
Lose the helmet.

35:31.833 --> 35:34.666
Makes you look aggressive.
Trying to cultivate trust.

35:35.416 --> 35:38.666
Keep your gun in the holster.
It might just keep you alive.

[Harp] Got you.

35:40.541 --> 35:41.416
[Harp sighs]

35:42.000 --> 35:43.916
Miller doesn't know
about our real mission?

35:44.000 --> 35:45.375
What about the colonel?

35:45.458 --> 35:48.625
Eckhart thinks you can manage
this conflict from behind a fence.

35:48.708 --> 35:49.916
War is ugly.

35:50.000 --> 35:52.625
Sometimes you gotta get dirty
to see any real change.

-He doesn't like you, you know.
-[Leo sighs]

36:05.208 --> 36:06.833
…I feel more than he does.

36:07.791 --> 36:08.791
That gut feeling?

36:08.875 --> 36:09.708
No.

I couldn't empathize with you if I didn't.
Like now, what do you feel?

36:25.625 --> 36:27.208
Shit-scared and confused.

36:27.291 --> 36:30.000
[Leo] That's good.
That means you're here and alive.

36:30.541 --> 36:32.791
Do you ever wonder
why I look like this, Harp?

36:33.375 --> 36:34.208
What?

36:35.083 --> 36:36.500
Chiseled cheekbones?

36:36.583 --> 36:37.416
Funny.

36:39.625 --> 36:43.708
Why would the Pentagon pick my face
to represent the United States Marines?

36:44.291 --> 36:47.208
Why wouldn't they make me
a blond-haired, blue-eyed,

36:47.291 --> 36:49.416
all-American varsity peckerwood?

36:49.500 --> 36:51.833
Didn't wanna ask.
Thought it might be robotist.

38:47.833 --> 38:50.125
Find out what they need
and give it to them.

38:50.208 --> 38:51.875
Most of 'em just wanna live.

38:51.958 --> 38:53.500
You manipulate people?

It's called compassion.

40:54.583 --> 40:55.791
[in Russian] Who are you?

40:57.708 --> 40:59.250
-[screams]
-[Leo] Who are you?

41:00.833 --> 41:03.125
Fuck yourself, American pig!

41:03.208 --> 41:05.833
-[screams]
-I can do this all day.

41:05.916 --> 41:08.083
[sniper breathes heavily]

41:08.750 --> 41:09.958
[Leo] Krasny.

41:10.958 --> 41:13.083
What do you know about Viktor Koval?

41:13.166 --> 41:15.291
-[man] Give him to us, Americans.
-Tell me!

41:16.208 --> 41:19.916
I hit you in your subclavian artery.
You're gonna bleed out.

41:20.416 --> 41:22.000
[gasps and grunts]

41:22.083 --> 41:23.583
So, where were we?

41:24.541 --> 41:25.750
[sniper groans]

41:25.833 --> 41:27.291
[Leo] Come on. Tell me!

41:27.833 --> 41:30.500
Or do you wanna spend
your final few moments

41:30.583 --> 41:31.750
with my friends here?

41:31.833 --> 41:33.666
[clamoring in Ukrainian]

41:34.666 --> 41:35.708
[sniper grunts]

41:36.541 --> 41:37.625
Suit yourself.

41:38.750 --> 41:40.125
[splutters]

41:41.083 --> 41:42.125
Cap.

41:43.166 --> 41:45.000
Cap, he's still alive.

41:45.083 --> 41:46.833
-[Leo] Not for long.
-[sniper chokes]

41:46.916 --> 41:48.000
[Leo] He's a fanatic.

41:48.708 --> 41:50.125
It always ends the same.

41:52.250 --> 41:53.750
Welcome to the war, kid.

42:00.375 --> 42:01.833
[shouting and grunting]

42:03.500 --> 42:05.166
[Harp] Hey! What the fuck?

42:05.250 --> 42:07.125
-You gotta call this in.
-Nothing to call in yet.

42:07.708 --> 42:10.875
What are you talking about?
We got insurgents. We got a sniper.

42:10.958 --> 42:14.541
That's enough to get command to listen,
to commit a fucking task force--

42:14.625 --> 42:18.416
All we have is enough for command
to hold us up in bureaucracy three days

42:18.500 --> 42:21.500
while they consider
if Perimeter's even a conversation.

42:21.583 --> 42:23.375
We don't have that kind of time.

42:23.458 --> 42:27.375
If their spies and snipers are here,
that means Koval isn't that far behind.

42:27.458 --> 42:30.458
You said we'd deliver
the vaccines to get intel on Koval.

42:30.541 --> 42:32.083
Where the fuck are we going?

42:32.708 --> 42:34.791
I didn't say the intel was at the clinic.

42:34.875 --> 42:37.791
This is a live-fire scenario, son.
Think you can handle it?

42:37.875 --> 42:40.250
-Tell me what you're hiding.
-[Leo laughs]

42:40.750 --> 42:43.125
I'll walk back to base,
tell 'em you went rogue.

42:44.958 --> 42:46.625
Did your motherboard freeze?

42:49.083 --> 42:51.958
Stop staring at me like that.
Did your motherboard freeze?

42:52.708 --> 42:53.791
Say something!

42:54.791 --> 42:58.875
Why are you such
a pain in my motherfucking ass?

42:59.583 --> 43:01.083
Get in the fucking truck.

43:01.166 --> 43:03.833
-Who programmed you to curse so much?
-Nobody.

43:03.916 --> 43:06.333
I respond to the asshole
that's in front of me.

43:06.416 --> 43:08.375
-Now get in the fucking truck!
-No.

43:10.583 --> 43:11.916
I'm not getting in there.

43:12.000 --> 43:12.833
Okay.

43:12.916 --> 43:13.750
Walk.

43:15.125 --> 43:18.000
How long do you think
you'll survive out here on your own?

43:18.583 --> 43:19.583
[rifles click]

43:25.958 --> 43:29.333
[tense, atmospheric music playing]

43:58.875 --> 44:00.458
You were right to fire.

44:02.833 --> 44:04.125
It was a launcher.

44:05.625 --> 44:07.583
You killed two marines but saved 38.

44:07.666 --> 44:10.083
They should've put
a fucking medal on your chest.

44:11.166 --> 44:12.500
I did the right thing.

44:14.416 --> 44:17.541
You mean you stepped outside your box,
and they had to put you back?

44:18.291 --> 44:21.083
-Is that why you think you're here?
-I broke chain of command.

44:23.041 --> 44:24.875
What about you? What's your mandate?

44:26.500 --> 44:29.791
Shit, I'm no expert, but this seems
beyond protocol for a r--

44:33.125 --> 44:34.208
…whatever you are.

44:37.250 --> 44:38.208
Shake my hand.

44:47.291 --> 44:48.250
What do you feel?

44:50.083 --> 44:51.875
A hand. Soft tissue and heat--

44:51.958 --> 44:52.791
Heat.

44:54.708 --> 44:55.791
Grab my arm.

44:58.958 --> 44:59.958
What do you feel?

45:00.041 --> 45:02.625
[atmospheric music plays]

45:04.375 --> 45:06.166
Cold. Steel.

45:06.250 --> 45:07.125
[Leo] Lifeless.

45:07.958 --> 45:09.500
I'm not a man, Lieutenant.

45:10.583 --> 45:12.458
I was created to simulate one

45:12.541 --> 45:14.791
to the exact necessity to do my damn job.

45:16.083 --> 45:17.375
I'm a combat soldier.

45:18.625 --> 45:22.458
But I also have the ability to break
the rules in certain circumstances.

45:22.541 --> 45:24.750
-Just like you.
-What kind of circumstances?

45:24.833 --> 45:28.583
In extreme situations, I have
the ability to act of my own volition.

45:30.666 --> 45:32.625
And is this an extreme situation?

45:32.708 --> 45:34.500
Ask me what you really wanna ask.

45:34.583 --> 45:35.916
How come you're so like us?

45:37.375 --> 45:38.375
Sentient?

45:38.458 --> 45:39.291
Emotional.

45:39.833 --> 45:42.083
So, you equate humanity with emotion?

45:42.166 --> 45:43.500
I equate it with fault.

45:44.166 --> 45:45.291
People are stupid,

45:45.375 --> 45:46.875
habitual, and lazy.

45:47.625 --> 45:49.750
Their emotions lead to mistakes.

45:52.083 --> 45:54.750
Maybe humans aren't
emotional enough, Lieutenant.

You finally found a friend.

47:23.333 --> 47:25.958
Pleasure to meet you. Lieutenant Harp.

47:26.041 --> 47:28.833
So formal.
You'll be calling me ma'am next.

47:30.833 --> 47:32.750
I hear you had some trouble in Damsk.

47:34.041 --> 47:35.458
The vaccines were delivered.

47:40.458 --> 47:42.416
Let's go, rookie. [chuckles]

47:50.500 --> 47:51.541
[Gump whirs]

47:52.041 --> 47:54.541
-Hello.
-[Gump beeps]

48:01.125 --> 48:03.916
I've done everything
you asked me to do, Sofiya.

48:04.541 --> 48:06.833
I'm gonna need you
to level with me, please.

48:06.916 --> 48:07.750
Come on.

48:09.208 --> 48:10.541
Tell me what you know.

48:11.625 --> 48:12.666
In front of him?

48:13.708 --> 48:14.833
You can trust him.

48:16.333 --> 48:18.583
-She can trust you. Right, Harp?
-Uh, yeah.

48:19.250 --> 48:21.000
Yeah, you can trust me.

48:26.125 --> 48:27.833
The violence at the hospital…

48:29.250 --> 48:30.833
It was definitely a Krasny spy?

48:30.916 --> 48:32.333
As Krasny as it gets.

48:32.416 --> 48:33.666
Fuck.

48:35.250 --> 48:37.958
I think Koval's one step away
from operating the silos.

48:38.041 --> 48:40.583
What? How'd you know that?

48:40.666 --> 48:44.750
The nuclear missiles can only be operated
by highly classified access codes.

48:47.041 --> 48:50.041
When the Cold War ended,
an FSK agent got hold of those codes

48:50.125 --> 48:51.833
and hid them in a vault.

48:51.916 --> 48:53.083
[loud locking echoes]

48:53.666 --> 48:55.625
Somewhere this side of the city.

48:55.708 --> 48:56.958
Why would he do that?

48:57.041 --> 48:59.208
The agent figured
the codes would fetch a price.

48:59.916 --> 49:02.166
-And Koval met that price.
-I think so.

49:03.125 --> 49:05.708
If he knows where the silos are,
and he gets those codes,

49:05.791 --> 49:07.291
he'll have access to nukes.

49:07.875 --> 49:08.791

49:09.375 --> 49:11.333
-Tell me where those codes are.
-I don't know.

49:11.416 --> 49:13.375
If we did,
we'd have gotten to them already.

49:13.458 --> 49:15.041
Well, tell me who might know.

49:16.250 --> 49:17.500
[sighs]

49:18.333 --> 49:19.458
[Leo] Come on.

49:19.541 --> 49:20.375
[Sofiya] Well,

49:21.333 --> 49:24.500
to break into a vault, the Krasny
would need to buy hardware here,

49:24.583 --> 49:27.583
as they wouldn't be able to smuggle it
or get it through our lines.

49:27.666 --> 49:29.125
What? Black market?

49:29.208 --> 49:32.750
[Sofiya] There's only one arsehole
with access to the weapons they'd need

49:32.833 --> 49:34.791
who wouldn't think twice
about betraying us.

49:34.875 --> 49:37.250
He's an arms dealer called Varyk Oshlak.

49:37.750 --> 49:40.166
If they went to him,
he might know where it's located.

49:42.166 --> 49:43.541
Can you take us to him?

49:44.791 --> 49:46.541
You'll need weapons of your own.

49:59.541 --> 50:00.833
[Harp] What's all this?

50:02.791 --> 50:04.708
Sadly, no discounts for the US.

50:04.791 --> 50:07.041
What? Hold up.
You're buying weapons from her?

50:07.125 --> 50:09.041
How do you think I pay for this orphanage?

50:10.291 --> 50:12.791
You know these are illegal weapons, right?

50:14.250 --> 50:16.250
You gonna arrest me, Lieutenant?

50:17.791 --> 50:18.625
Cap?

50:22.750 --> 50:23.750
[chuckles softly]

50:25.708 --> 50:28.875
-[Sofiya] You have to do this for us.
-I know. I will.

50:29.375 --> 50:31.166
-What about him?
-He'll be fine.

50:31.750 --> 50:33.916
It's his first day outside the wire.

50:36.041 --> 50:37.125
His first day?

50:37.958 --> 50:39.375
He's a drone pilot.

50:48.500 --> 50:50.500
[children laugh and chat]

50:52.541 --> 50:55.000
How does it feel
to see your work up close?

50:58.500 --> 50:59.333
My work?

50:59.916 --> 51:02.833
Yeah. Most of these kids
weren't orphaned by the civil war.

51:03.875 --> 51:05.833
Your bombs destroyed their homes.

Get in the car.

51:47.958 --> 51:49.833
-[Leo] You sure about this?
-[horn beeps]

51:49.916 --> 51:52.333
[Sofiya] That's his car. He's here.

You wanna try that again,
or should I fuck you up a little?

53:32.166 --> 53:33.166
[Oshlak] Okay, okay.

53:34.083 --> 53:35.125
Hey, Sofiya.

53:35.208 --> 53:36.875
I haven't seen you for long.

53:36.958 --> 53:39.166
-I can see how much you missed me.
-[chuckles]

53:39.250 --> 53:41.500
Stop. I'll tell you whatever you want.

53:41.583 --> 53:44.375
Did you sell weapons
to a Krasny unit this morning?

53:44.458 --> 53:47.125
Ten men. They took delivery one hour ago.

53:47.208 --> 53:49.541
Details, piece of shit.
What did you sell them?

53:49.625 --> 53:51.000
XR-12s.

53:51.083 --> 53:52.500
Russian Gumps?

53:54.208 --> 53:55.708
Where's the vault?

53:55.791 --> 53:59.083
-Well, I'm a dead man if--
-Either I kill you or Koval kills you,

Be careful.

54:26.750 --> 54:27.958
[Leo] I will.

54:28.041 --> 54:28.875
Go.

54:30.375 --> 54:31.708
Come on! Let's go.

54:35.750 --> 54:38.583

-Head north, take Magistral.

We can't go up against Koval alone.
We gotta call in for backup.

Come on, Harp.
What's wrong? You scared? [laughs]

54:56.250 --> 54:58.083
At what point does your program shut down?

54:58.166 --> 55:01.375
-At what point are you violating orders?
-That's why you're here.

55:01.458 --> 55:05.583
Our intel investigation into the Perimeter
is not just cold. It was aborted.

55:07.416 --> 55:08.416
I'm sorry, what?

55:08.500 --> 55:10.875
An intel officer like you
can follow an aborted line,

55:10.958 --> 55:14.041
and it's considered a hunch.
If I do it, it's a fault.

55:15.041 --> 55:17.125
Intel would take me offline,
leaving Koval to win.

55:18.875 --> 55:20.583
[tires screeching]

55:20.666 --> 55:24.125
What about your internal systems?
At what point do you cross the line?

55:24.208 --> 55:25.666
When you're no longer with me.

55:27.083 --> 55:29.958
I requested your deployment
because I need your help.

55:30.041 --> 55:33.250
That means this whole shitty time,
I'm the one breaking orders?

55:33.333 --> 55:35.250
I'll go to jail! I can't do this shit.

55:35.333 --> 55:37.250
-Tell me to stop the car.
-You'll stop?

55:37.333 --> 55:38.833
Tell me to stop the car!

55:38.916 --> 55:40.833
We're the only ones searching for him.

55:40.916 --> 55:43.791
But if you don't think
it's worth your time, call it in,

55:43.875 --> 55:46.541
they'll shut me down,
and you can fucking walk!

55:46.625 --> 55:48.791
-Okay, let me… Let me think.
-[Leo scoffs]

55:48.875 --> 55:49.875
[sighs heavily]

55:56.958 --> 55:58.250
-You still thinking?
-Yes!

55:58.333 --> 56:02.333
All I'm saying is, calling in for backup
might not be such a bad idea.

56:02.416 --> 56:03.750
That's all I'm saying.

-[sighs] Are you sure about this?

56:37.083 --> 56:39.750
The Russians have
the capability to detect the signal.

56:39.833 --> 56:42.125
-They put your tracker on your back?
-Cut it out.

56:44.875 --> 56:46.208
[Leo grunts]

56:47.333 --> 56:49.250
-Does it hurt?
-Of course it fucking hurts.

Fuck.

1:10:02.333 --> 1:10:03.750
[breathes deeply]

1:10:03.833 --> 1:10:06.875
[woman cries]

1:10:16.750 --> 1:10:17.958
[woman] Weapons are hot.

1:10:20.166 --> 1:10:21.250
Target locked.

1:10:26.416 --> 1:10:28.958
[woman speaks Ukrainian]

1:10:29.041 --> 1:10:30.708
Come on. Come on!

1:10:31.958 --> 1:10:34.375
We're gonna go in there, okay?
Okay. You ready?

1:10:35.208 --> 1:10:36.583
Let's go.

1:10:40.208 --> 1:10:42.000
Fuck. Get down, get down!

1:10:45.666 --> 1:10:46.583
[screaming]

1:10:49.416 --> 1:10:50.750
[woman] Target destroyed.

1:10:51.791 --> 1:10:52.625
Gotcha.

1:10:53.833 --> 1:11:00.375
[siren wails]

1:11:17.875 --> 1:11:19.166
Are we okay?

1:11:20.041 --> 1:11:21.125
Yeah.

1:11:21.208 --> 1:11:22.291
Stay here.

1:11:23.458 --> 1:11:24.291
Stay.

1:11:28.208 --> 1:11:29.250
[groans]

1:11:29.333 --> 1:11:31.375
[sound distorts]

1:11:32.791 --> 1:11:33.791
[grunts]

1:11:43.208 --> 1:11:44.208
They're all dead.

1:11:51.250 --> 1:11:53.250
I tried to save 'em, you know.

1:11:56.583 --> 1:11:58.000
I tried to save 'em.

1:12:08.791 --> 1:12:10.791
Now you see your work first-hand.

1:12:14.583 --> 1:12:18.000
-[Leo] Goddamn, you a cold motherfucker.
-I'm aware we kill people, Captain.

1:12:22.583 --> 1:12:24.041
[Miller] Incoming!

1:12:24.625 --> 1:12:25.833
[screaming]

1:12:25.916 --> 1:12:27.750
[man] I don't wanna die down here!

1:12:27.833 --> 1:12:29.625
[Miller] They were only 19 years old.

1:12:31.000 --> 1:12:32.458
[Harp] Good job, Harp.

1:12:40.583 --> 1:12:42.125
Did you get the codes?

1:12:48.416 --> 1:12:49.541
The codes. Did you…

1:12:51.750 --> 1:12:52.666
I got 'em.

1:12:57.333 --> 1:12:59.041
Great, let's call it in.

1:13:01.250 --> 1:13:02.166
[sighs]

1:13:10.041 --> 1:13:13.041
What the fuck are you up to, Leo? Hmm?

1:13:15.791 --> 1:13:17.333
I see you, you know.

1:13:18.750 --> 1:13:20.166
You brought me here.

1:13:21.958 --> 1:13:24.500
A drone pilot
with a history of gross disobedience,

1:13:24.583 --> 1:13:27.833
punished and humiliated,
and with nobody to believe anything I say

1:13:27.916 --> 1:13:31.083
unless you back it up, so tell me
what the fuck am I doing here,

1:13:31.166 --> 1:13:32.833
and what are you using me for?

1:13:32.916 --> 1:13:35.291
Sounds like you don't trust me, Harp.

1:13:36.416 --> 1:13:37.625
That makes me upset.

1:13:40.291 --> 1:13:41.833
You weren't assigned, Harp.

1:13:42.541 --> 1:13:46.875
I chose you. I needed someone
who could think outside the box.

1:13:49.291 --> 1:13:52.625
Leo, I'm ordering you
to return us back to base immediately

1:13:52.708 --> 1:13:55.625
-or be in breach of your moral directives.
-[Leo scoffs]

1:13:55.708 --> 1:13:58.625
And the fact that I can act
of my own volition scares you.

1:13:58.708 --> 1:14:00.375
No, you need me to validate you.

1:14:00.458 --> 1:14:02.250
Oh, come on! Here we go.

1:14:02.333 --> 1:14:03.833
Who validates you?

1:14:03.916 --> 1:14:05.583
You follow me, I follow you.

1:14:05.666 --> 1:14:08.041
It's kinda like
a paradox of command, isn't it?

1:14:08.125 --> 1:14:11.416
-I'm ordering you to stop the fucking car.
-Or what?

1:14:13.125 --> 1:14:15.125
Hmm? [laughs]

1:14:15.958 --> 1:14:19.375
My backup system allows me
to relinquish the need for human authority

1:14:19.458 --> 1:14:23.041
if said person is exhibiting
improper or impaired judgment.

1:14:23.125 --> 1:14:24.250
You, my friend,

1:14:24.833 --> 1:14:28.291
have exercised improper,
impaired judgment throughout this mission…

1:14:29.791 --> 1:14:31.625
-Do you trust me?
-Yes, sir.

1:14:33.750 --> 1:14:38.125
[Leo] …including the removal
of one fail-safe device.

1:14:38.916 --> 1:14:41.458
A what? You told me that was your tracker.

1:14:43.541 --> 1:14:46.125
You disabled US military hardware.

1:14:47.125 --> 1:14:49.000
Thanks to your air strike back there…

1:14:49.083 --> 1:14:50.875
Tell him Koval's in the building.

1:14:50.958 --> 1:14:52.666
…Eckhart thinks I'm destroyed.

1:14:54.166 --> 1:14:55.041
Gotcha.

1:14:56.541 --> 1:14:58.208
[Leo] War is ugly.

1:14:59.041 --> 1:15:02.000
Sometimes you gotta get dirty
to see any real change.

1:15:05.125 --> 1:15:07.583
Hey, hey! Don't grow balls now.

1:15:10.708 --> 1:15:11.791
Put it down.

1:15:13.458 --> 1:15:14.541
There you go.

1:15:17.083 --> 1:15:18.708
You owe me more than this, man.

1:15:20.333 --> 1:15:21.166
Nah, kid.

1:15:22.916 --> 1:15:24.750
I just saved your fucking life.

1:15:32.833 --> 1:15:34.750
[children speak Ukrainian]

1:15:35.250 --> 1:15:36.250
[grunts]

1:15:36.333 --> 1:15:37.958
[children giggle]

1:15:38.041 --> 1:15:40.583
[breathes heavily]

1:15:41.166 --> 1:15:44.083
[muffled music]

1:15:47.000 --> 1:15:51.333
-[music continues]
-[breathes heavily]

1:15:51.416 --> 1:15:54.291
-[chatter]
-[music becomes clearer]

1:15:58.375 --> 1:16:01.041
[children laugh]

1:16:03.500 --> 1:16:05.000
[boy speaks Ukrainian]

1:16:16.625 --> 1:16:17.458
Fuck!

1:16:23.125 --> 1:16:24.125
[men shout]

1:16:26.833 --> 1:16:28.875
-[men shout]
-[Harp yells]

1:16:38.000 --> 1:16:40.791
[Russian radio chatter]

1:17:00.291 --> 1:17:01.375
[coughing]

1:17:02.375 --> 1:17:04.250
[Harp] Can't fucking breathe in here.

1:17:04.833 --> 1:17:07.750
[gasps] Hello?
I can't fucking breathe in here!

1:17:07.833 --> 1:17:08.791
[grunts]

1:17:08.875 --> 1:17:10.500
The boss is coming! Be quiet.

1:17:10.583 --> 1:17:11.666
[Harp yells]

1:17:11.750 --> 1:17:13.000
What the fuck is that?

1:17:13.083 --> 1:17:14.708
[Sofiya] Sodium pentothal.

1:17:14.791 --> 1:17:17.458
It's truth serum.
You'll tell us all we need to know.

1:17:18.791 --> 1:17:19.791
[Harp] The boss?

1:17:20.541 --> 1:17:22.708
[gasps]

1:17:23.375 --> 1:17:24.458
Jesus Christ.

1:17:26.000 --> 1:17:28.875
-Are you the leader of the Resistance?
-Are you our enemy?

1:17:28.958 --> 1:17:31.125
No. No, I'm not your fucking enemy.

1:17:31.208 --> 1:17:32.916
I-I don't have any information.

1:17:34.500 --> 1:17:38.083
[laughs] It wasn't pentothal.
It was antibiotic for your wounds.

1:17:40.291 --> 1:17:41.291
[Harp scoffs]

1:17:42.375 --> 1:17:43.375
Right. Awesome joke.

1:17:43.458 --> 1:17:45.458
Hilarious, comical, very fucking funny.

1:17:45.541 --> 1:17:46.875
Can you untie me now?

1:17:46.958 --> 1:17:50.208
-Not until I know you're no threat.
-I'm not a threat. Leo is.

1:17:50.291 --> 1:17:53.125
-I think he's going after Perimeter.
-No, he's going for Koval.

1:17:53.208 --> 1:17:55.333
-Then he's going for Perimeter.
-Koval's dead.

1:17:55.416 --> 1:17:57.791
-He died in the bank strike.
-He wasn't there.

1:17:59.833 --> 1:18:01.458
He's still very much alive.

1:18:10.291 --> 1:18:13.791
Leo's going to take control of
the nuclear missiles for the Resistance.

1:18:15.166 --> 1:18:16.000
For us.

1:18:19.666 --> 1:18:21.541
I told you I'd get the codes, Viktor.

1:18:23.291 --> 1:18:24.291
General Koval.

1:18:26.250 --> 1:18:27.958
Why would you try to kill me?

1:18:34.666 --> 1:18:35.916
Oh, Leo…

1:18:40.375 --> 1:18:41.666
I took insurance.

1:18:41.750 --> 1:18:43.708
I am your insurance.

1:18:43.791 --> 1:18:44.916
[chuckles]

1:18:51.625 --> 1:18:52.750
You have the codes?

1:19:00.500 --> 1:19:01.916
-Give them.
-[Leo scoffs]

1:19:06.208 --> 1:19:08.916
What's stopping me
from killing you and taking it?

1:19:09.000 --> 1:19:11.708
You honestly think
I would have them with me, Viktor?

1:19:12.458 --> 1:19:13.541
I'm not an idiot.

1:19:15.000 --> 1:19:16.666
That would make me human.

1:19:20.041 --> 1:19:21.166
[laughs]

1:19:22.375 --> 1:19:23.875
That's what he told you.

1:19:25.083 --> 1:19:27.416
-We trust in Leo.
-You trust in Leo?

1:19:28.083 --> 1:19:31.583
He's more likely to take control
of the nukes himself, and he used you.

1:19:34.083 --> 1:19:36.166
-He told you that?
-Not in so many words.

1:19:36.958 --> 1:19:40.625
I don't know exactly why he's doing it,
but you can't trust him.

1:19:41.333 --> 1:19:42.916
He's a machine, Sofiya.

1:19:46.333 --> 1:19:47.666
What do you want?

1:19:48.875 --> 1:19:51.166
I want the location of Perimeter.

1:19:51.250 --> 1:19:52.291
Hmm.

1:19:54.166 --> 1:19:55.666
What do I get in return?

1:19:59.500 --> 1:20:00.625
I'll let you live.

1:20:00.708 --> 1:20:01.958
[laughs]

1:20:04.625 --> 1:20:07.083
I didn't know your kind
had such a sense of humor.

1:20:11.125 --> 1:20:15.375
It's incredible
what man is able to create.

1:20:17.250 --> 1:20:20.250
[Sofiya] I think I know Leo
better than you, Lieutenant Harp.

1:20:20.875 --> 1:20:23.708
You see, Leo, he can't lie to himself.

1:20:24.375 --> 1:20:27.541
He can't pretend
there's virtue in an immoral act.

1:20:28.708 --> 1:20:30.333
That's why he's gone rogue.

1:20:31.291 --> 1:20:35.041
-He's learned who the real enemy is.
-The real enemy. Who? The US military?

1:20:35.125 --> 1:20:38.041
They rationalize this war
because it serves their fucking agenda.

1:20:38.125 --> 1:20:39.833
This is a peacekeeping mission.

1:20:39.916 --> 1:20:40.875
[scoffs] "Peace."

1:20:40.958 --> 1:20:43.500
Russia wants its former territories back.

1:20:43.583 --> 1:20:48.083
The US wants to destabilize Russia
by extending conflict in those countries.

1:20:48.166 --> 1:20:51.125
We are the ones
who want fucking peace, Lieutenant Harp.

1:20:51.708 --> 1:20:54.500
And if Leo's rogue operation
makes sure you leave us in peace,

1:20:54.583 --> 1:20:58.416
if your war machine turns against you,
well then, why should I fucking care?

1:20:59.250 --> 1:21:01.125
[Leo] A crazy terrorist with nukes.

1:21:02.708 --> 1:21:04.750
Downtown Washington, New York…

1:21:06.458 --> 1:21:08.333
[screaming]

1:21:08.416 --> 1:21:09.625
Who knows?

1:21:13.666 --> 1:21:16.333
He's gonna launch
a nuclear strike on the US.

1:21:19.541 --> 1:21:20.500
[sniffs]

1:21:21.083 --> 1:21:23.125
Innocent people will die.

1:21:27.541 --> 1:21:29.208
Aren't they just collateral?

1:21:32.125 --> 1:21:33.750
Or not when it's American lives.

1:21:33.833 --> 1:21:37.083
It's not collateral. It's mass murder.
You can't let him do this.

1:21:40.500 --> 1:21:42.875
What will you do with so much power?

1:21:45.000 --> 1:21:46.833
That's between me and my creator.

1:21:46.916 --> 1:21:48.125
Philosophical.

1:21:48.208 --> 1:21:49.125
Mm-hmm.

1:21:49.625 --> 1:21:51.625
What would you do with it, Viktor?

1:21:53.625 --> 1:21:55.541
I will guarantee world peace.

1:21:57.041 --> 1:21:58.375
[both laugh]

1:21:59.958 --> 1:22:03.041
-I knew you would say that.
-Well, yeah. Can you say the same?

1:22:03.125 --> 1:22:04.208
We'll see.

1:22:08.333 --> 1:22:09.875
Now we have a deal.

1:22:12.333 --> 1:22:14.291
I take Perimeter.

1:22:15.333 --> 1:22:17.083
Then I dictate.

1:22:19.708 --> 1:22:21.875
-Let's forget what happened.
-[Leo scoffs]

1:22:21.958 --> 1:22:24.125
We can be good allies
in the worst to come.

1:22:24.208 --> 1:22:25.625
[they chuckle]

1:22:26.458 --> 1:22:29.833
Don't make me have to ruin
this marvel of American technology.

1:22:29.916 --> 1:22:31.041
[laughs]

1:22:32.708 --> 1:22:33.958
Viktor Koval,

1:22:35.250 --> 1:22:36.916
the Terror of the Balkans.

1:22:37.000 --> 1:22:38.458
My man,

1:22:38.541 --> 1:22:42.541
what makes you think
that you're still calling shots?

1:22:44.250 --> 1:22:46.583
You should have never tried to kill me.

1:22:57.625 --> 1:22:58.625
[laughs]

1:23:00.875 --> 1:23:01.958
[Viktor yells]

1:23:13.083 --> 1:23:14.833
[Viktor yells]

1:24:06.291 --> 1:24:07.833
[chokes quietly]

1:24:14.875 --> 1:24:16.666
How many people will die?

1:24:20.791 --> 1:24:22.875
How many people will die, Sofiya?

1:24:23.625 --> 1:24:24.625
[sniffs]

1:24:28.958 --> 1:24:30.250
Can't answer it, can you?

1:24:30.333 --> 1:24:31.166
[gun clicks]

1:24:32.458 --> 1:24:34.625
[Harp breathes heavily]

1:24:37.958 --> 1:24:39.083
[computer beeps]

1:24:43.750 --> 1:24:46.916
[Sofiya] Enough to teach Americans
about collateral damage.

1:24:55.958 --> 1:24:57.083
You're on your own.

1:24:59.125 --> 1:25:00.000
What?

1:25:00.708 --> 1:25:02.291
Go home. It's over.

1:25:05.791 --> 1:25:07.333
Spasiba, Viktor.

1:25:50.375 --> 1:25:51.208

1:25:56.041 --> 1:25:57.250
Stay where you are!

1:26:00.166 --> 1:26:01.833
I said, stay where you are!

1:26:02.625 --> 1:26:03.750
Down on the ground!

1:26:14.000 --> 1:26:16.375
Dismissed. At ease.

1:26:25.583 --> 1:26:26.750
What the hell's going on?

1:26:28.333 --> 1:26:30.708
Sergeant Miller has been briefed
on Operation Leo. Go ahead.

1:26:32.875 --> 1:26:34.375
Leo's alive, sir.

1:26:35.541 --> 1:26:37.208
-He's gone AWOL.
-[Eckhart sighs]

1:26:38.833 --> 1:26:39.666
Right.

1:26:40.500 --> 1:26:43.041
I appreciate
that you had a rough time out there.

1:26:43.125 --> 1:26:46.375
Captain Leo was destroyed.
We lost his signal immediately.

1:26:46.458 --> 1:26:49.125
He lost his signal
'cause I removed his fail-safe.

1:26:50.291 --> 1:26:51.125
You did what?

1:26:51.208 --> 1:26:54.291
I know I fucked up, okay?
But, sir, you've gotta listen to me.

1:26:54.375 --> 1:26:56.833
Leo has the codes,
and he's going after the silos.

1:26:56.916 --> 1:26:58.208
He's on his way to Koval.

1:26:58.291 --> 1:26:59.875
You said Koval was at the bank.

1:26:59.958 --> 1:27:02.458
-He's dead.
-Leo tricked me. Koval was never there.

1:27:02.541 --> 1:27:06.000
Wanted me to call in the drone strike
so it would appear he'd been destroyed.

1:27:06.083 --> 1:27:08.833
You could've turned back,
he would've been forced to comply.

1:27:08.916 --> 1:27:13.000
Leo's smarter than we are. He's stronger,
faster, and he can be very persuasive.

1:27:13.083 --> 1:27:16.166
This Viktor Koval Perimeter stuff,
it's all bullshit!

1:27:16.750 --> 1:27:18.916
Anything to it,
Intel would've made it priority.

1:27:19.000 --> 1:27:21.250
-I am the fucking Intel!
-Sit down!

1:27:26.875 --> 1:27:28.166
I saw the heist, sir.

1:27:29.333 --> 1:27:30.583
I was eyes on the ground.

1:27:32.166 --> 1:27:33.291
Perimeter's real, sir.

1:27:34.458 --> 1:27:36.833
-And Leo's going after it.
-I thought Koval was.

1:27:36.916 --> 1:27:40.083
Leo's playing the Krasnys
and the Resistance against each other.

1:27:41.041 --> 1:27:43.041
They all have the same goal.

1:27:43.125 --> 1:27:44.583
Nuke the US mainland.

1:27:48.041 --> 1:27:49.958
-But Leo is calling the shots.

1:27:50.041 --> 1:27:51.333
Impossible. He can't--

1:27:51.416 --> 1:27:55.291
He can! He put a gun to my head and said
something about a paradox of command.

1:27:56.625 --> 1:27:59.041
Me using my judgment
triggered his fail-safe directive

1:27:59.125 --> 1:28:02.375
to relinquish his need
to follow human authority.

1:28:08.541 --> 1:28:09.791

1:28:11.000 --> 1:28:11.958
[sighs]

1:28:14.875 --> 1:28:17.875
-How do you know he's gonna meet Koval?
-It's a long fucking story.

1:28:17.958 --> 1:28:19.958
Sir, we don't have time for this, okay?

1:28:20.041 --> 1:28:21.708
-We've gotta find him fast.
-How?

1:28:21.791 --> 1:28:24.291
Hmm? You made that practically impossible,
Lieutenant.

1:28:24.875 --> 1:28:26.000
How's he getting around?

1:28:28.083 --> 1:28:29.125
Oshlak's car.

1:28:30.750 --> 1:28:32.458
Who the fuck is Oshlak?

1:28:32.541 --> 1:28:35.166
Arms dealer.
We've been tracking him for months.

1:28:38.458 --> 1:28:40.666
It'll take us hours to go through Central.

1:28:41.250 --> 1:28:42.458
Do you have a phone?

1:28:43.166 --> 1:28:44.041
Corporal Bale.

1:28:44.125 --> 1:28:45.916
Bale, it's Harp.

1:28:47.375 --> 1:28:49.125
-Harp?
-I need your help fast.

1:28:49.208 --> 1:28:50.708
-What's going on?
-I'll explain later

1:28:50.791 --> 1:28:52.083
for now, trust me, okay?

1:28:54.041 --> 1:28:54.916

1:28:57.000 --> 1:28:58.041
Bale?

1:28:58.125 --> 1:28:59.291
-Okay.
-Help me.

1:28:59.375 --> 1:29:00.208
Okay.

1:29:00.916 --> 1:29:04.625
Okay. Do we have any surveillance drones
out in the Snovski District

1:29:04.708 --> 1:29:06.083
along the Russian border?

1:29:06.166 --> 1:29:07.083

Yes, that's him. Okay, okay. Stay on him.

1:29:42.750 --> 1:29:43.666
Copy that.

1:29:43.750 --> 1:29:45.041

on the Russian border.

1:29:58.916 --> 1:30:02.666
I can't send forces over unverified intel.
I will start a war with the Russians.

1:30:02.750 --> 1:30:04.166
You don't have to, sir.

1:30:05.666 --> 1:30:06.500
I'll go.

1:30:06.583 --> 1:30:08.208
Harp, you said it yourself.

1:30:08.708 --> 1:30:10.625
He's stronger, faster, smarter.

1:30:10.708 --> 1:30:13.625
-Once I find him, I'll call it in.
-And then what?

1:30:15.875 --> 1:30:19.208
Can we drone strike the silos
without detonating the warheads?

1:30:20.291 --> 1:30:22.875
It'll take out the command center
and disarm the missiles.

1:30:22.958 --> 1:30:24.291
What if you don't get to him?

1:30:24.375 --> 1:30:28.125
Then deny we had this conversation
and pray I'm wrong about his plans.

1:30:31.041 --> 1:30:32.541

when to hit that red button, Harp.

-[Russian PA announcement]
-[rapid beeping]

1:42:20.000 --> 1:42:21.916
Jesus Christ! Better move your ass.

1:42:22.000 --> 1:42:23.333
Harp, do you copy?

1:42:23.416 --> 1:42:24.416
Don't do it.

[breathes heavily]

1:42:28.375 --> 1:42:29.208
Harp.

1:42:29.916 --> 1:42:31.833
You know this makes sense.

1:42:32.333 --> 1:42:33.666
It's the greater good.

1:42:35.750 --> 1:42:38.375
You, of all people,
should understand that.

-We've got to pull the trigger.
-Sir?

1:42:50.416 --> 1:42:51.500
For fuck's sake.

1:42:51.583 --> 1:42:54.666
The drone strike is imminent.
Clear out of there, Alpha Three.

1:42:55.708 --> 1:42:56.541
No.

1:42:58.541 --> 1:42:59.666
You're wrong.

1:43:00.833 --> 1:43:02.833
Humans can learn to do better.

1:43:04.791 --> 1:43:07.125
That is the greater good, Leo.

1:43:08.416 --> 1:43:10.708
[Eckhart] Harp, goddammit, do you copy?

1:43:15.250 --> 1:43:16.083

DA1 off the rail in 30.

[heavy rumbling]

1:43:36.416 --> 1:43:38.041

1:44:18.833 --> 1:44:20.083
Alpha Three, come in.

1:44:22.958 --> 1:44:25.041
Harp, this is Eckhart. Do you copy?

Returning back to base.

1:44:58.791 --> 1:45:00.000
Over.

1:45:00.083 --> 1:45:01.166
Copy that.

1:45:02.000 --> 1:45:03.166
Great job, kid.

1:45:05.583 --> 1:45:07.083
You just saved the world.

1:45:09.208 --> 1:45:12.666
[poignant music playing]

1:45:21.583 --> 1:45:23.458
Harp, you should be proud, son.

1:45:26.625 --> 1:45:28.625
I already spoke to your captain, Brydon.

1:45:29.791 --> 1:45:31.083
You're going home.
