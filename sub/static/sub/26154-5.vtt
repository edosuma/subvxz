A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

00:09.009 --> 00:11.011
[classical music playing]

00:11.678 --> 00:13.888
[man on TV]  Can't you see?
You don't belong here!

00:13.972 --> 00:16.808
Destiny has bigger plans for you.
Oh, yes.

00:16.891 --> 00:19.352
-[woman on TV]  But this is my home.
- [rooster crows]

00:19.477 --> 00:21.396
It's the only home I've ever known!

00:21.479 --> 00:23.481
-[voices]
-[man]  You were made for the skies.

00:23.565 --> 00:25.984
Why do you think
they named you Amelia Earhart?

00:26.067 --> 00:29.529
It's because your heart...
belongs in the air.

00:29.612 --> 00:32.157
[reciting Amelia's lines]
It's true, that is my name.

00:32.240 --> 00:35.702
-Ah! Boots, leave your sister alone!
-She started it!

00:35.785 --> 00:39.205
Well, stop it right now
or I'll pop the both of you.

00:39.289 --> 00:43.543
So, put on those flygirl goggles,
get in your biplane and fly to the sun.

00:43.793 --> 00:46.504
[reciting] But a woman's never flown
to the sun before.

00:46.588 --> 00:48.923
Come on! What other gal's
got the get-up-and-go

00:49.007 --> 00:52.802
to tame those savage sun beasts
and become their queen?

00:52.886 --> 00:54.512
How many times
have you watched this tape?

00:54.596 --> 00:56.806
When you get me a second tape,
I'll watch something else.

00:56.890 --> 00:58.600
What am I, made of tapes?

00:58.850 --> 00:59.809
[man]  That's the spirit!

00:59.893 --> 01:02.896
[reciting] I suppose the most effective
way to do it is to do it!

01:02.979 --> 01:04.981
[phone buzzing, meowing]

01:08.735 --> 01:11.362
[sighs] Hello?

01:11.446 --> 01:14.532
How the hell do they expect me to learn
five pages of dialogue in one day?

01:14.616 --> 01:16.284
-What am I, Young Sheldon?
-BoJack--

01:16.367 --> 01:19.829
No show should have that much talking.
TV is a visual medium.

01:19.954 --> 01:22.415
-Anyway, where the hell are you?
-Eden, North Carolina.

01:22.499 --> 01:25.585
Ugh, North Carolina?
That's the second worst of the Carolinas.

01:25.668 --> 01:28.505
-You know I'm from here, right?
-Yeah, and you got out.

01:28.588 --> 01:30.173
You know what "from" means?

01:30.256 --> 01:32.842
You don't have to be there anymore.
That's why they call it "from."

01:32.926 --> 01:35.678
Okay, I'm about to be
from  this conversation.

01:35.762 --> 01:38.348
Wait, wait. I'm sorry.
Can we just talk about Mr. Peanutbutter?

01:38.431 --> 01:40.642
Why did you cast him on this show?
Everybody loves him.

01:40.725 --> 01:43.394
I'm the guy everybody's supposed to love.
I'm Philbert.

01:43.478 --> 01:45.772
-Ugh!
-So then I got a food truck for the crew

01:45.855 --> 01:48.191
with a big sign that said,
"From your favorite star,"

01:48.274 --> 01:50.276
but everybody thought
it was from Mr. Peanutbutter.

01:50.360 --> 01:51.778
They didn't even read the sign.

01:51.861 --> 01:53.446
BoJack, I'm gonna be back tomorrow.

01:53.530 --> 01:55.532
Do you think you can handle your shit
until then?

01:55.615 --> 01:58.618
Oh, yeah, that sounds like me.
What are you doing there anyway?

01:58.743 --> 02:01.913
Just... taking care of some family stuff.

02:03.623 --> 02:06.459
[series theme music playing]

02:59.470 --> 03:01.222
Thanks for coming, all this way.

03:01.306 --> 03:04.267
-We could've just talked on the phone.
-I wanted to meet you in person.

03:04.350 --> 03:06.102
That's the Princess Carolyn difference.

03:06.186 --> 03:09.522
Ooh! I've never met a person who had
a difference named after them before.

03:09.606 --> 03:12.609
Well, this is important.
We're here to talk about your baby.

03:12.692 --> 03:14.777
I know what you're thinking;
another dumb teenager,

03:14.861 --> 03:18.031
so liquored up, she forgot to make sure
her boyfriend wrapped his tweedle.

03:18.114 --> 03:20.575
Well, that's all true,
but I'm not some backwoods hick.

03:20.658 --> 03:23.036
-Oh!
-I'm 18, I got my whole life ahead of me,

03:23.119 --> 03:25.622
and it's not like my boyfriend's begging
me to marry him.

03:25.705 --> 03:27.290
Boyfriends rarely do.

03:27.498 --> 03:30.210
-His name's Strib, short for Dennis.
-Uh, sure.

03:30.293 --> 03:31.961
He's not exactly the romantic type,

03:32.045 --> 03:35.423
but he's got those eyes
you just can't say no to, you know?

03:35.506 --> 03:38.384
I hope you and Strib have
many happy child-free years, together.

03:38.468 --> 03:42.138
I'm willing to do whatever I can
to help contribute to the child-free part.

03:42.222 --> 03:43.932
-Hmm.
-[phone buzzing, meowing]

03:44.015 --> 03:45.391
Oh, sorry. It's work.

03:45.475 --> 03:47.227
Everyone I work with is such a baby.

03:47.477 --> 03:49.395
And I love babies!
[laughs]

03:49.479 --> 03:50.688
Hello, baby.

03:50.813 --> 03:53.566
Hey, listen, I know Flip
just wants me to be "the woman",

03:53.650 --> 03:56.611
and keep my mouth shut,
but this show makes no sense.

03:56.694 --> 03:59.489
In the rooftop motorcycle scene,
Fritz and Philbert keep saying,

03:59.572 --> 04:02.575
"This is so dangerous."
"Yeah, man. We're really dangerous."

04:02.659 --> 04:04.535
But then they just get off
the motorcycles.

04:04.619 --> 04:07.038
Why aren't they skidding
towards the side of the building,

04:07.121 --> 04:10.500
and then they roll off just as their bikes
go careening over the edge?

04:10.583 --> 04:11.834
Okay, sure, pitch it to Flip.

04:11.918 --> 04:13.503
Everything I pitch, he shoots down.

04:13.586 --> 04:16.047
That's just because it's coming
from someone who isn't him.

04:16.130 --> 04:17.674
If you want him to like your idea,

04:17.757 --> 04:19.634
just convince him
he thought of it, himself.

04:19.717 --> 04:22.053
You really think he'll do it
because I say it's his idea?

04:22.136 --> 04:24.055
That's a great idea, Diane.

04:24.138 --> 04:25.890
Oh, thanks! I'm gonna do it.

04:25.974 --> 04:27.976
-So sorry.
-No problem.

04:28.559 --> 04:32.814
Um, just so you know, I have met with
some other candidates, mostly couples.

04:32.897 --> 04:33.773
Oh.

04:33.856 --> 04:36.234
I couldn't believe I found someone
who grew up in Eden.

04:36.317 --> 04:39.404
-When's the last time you were here?
-Oh, not since my mother died.

04:39.487 --> 04:41.906
-Oh, I'm sorry.
-It was a long time ago.

04:41.990 --> 04:44.492
-She's still dead, though.
-That is true.

04:45.201 --> 04:47.203
[sipping]

04:48.162 --> 04:50.748
-Sorry we had to meet at Phuzzy's.
-I love Phuzzy's.

04:50.832 --> 04:53.084
I bet you got fancy restaurants
in LA, huh?

04:53.167 --> 04:55.545
Probably a California Pizza Kitchen
on every corner.

04:55.628 --> 04:58.131
Or do y'all call it "Pizza Kitchen,"
since you're in California?

04:58.214 --> 05:01.259
No, we call it "California Pizza Kitchen,"
or "CPK."

05:01.342 --> 05:04.762
CPK? What kind of city person's too busy
to say "California Pizza Kitchen"?

05:04.846 --> 05:07.724
You gotta catch a bus or something?
Stay a while and say the whole name.

05:07.807 --> 05:09.392
Yeah, yeah, well, I'm not like that.

05:09.475 --> 05:12.103
I live in Los Angeles now,
but you know what they say,

05:12.186 --> 05:13.146
you can take the girl

05:13.229 --> 05:16.190
out of the Greensboro-High Point
metropolitan area, but you can't take

05:16.274 --> 05:18.860
the Greensboro-High Point
metropolitan area out of the girl.

05:18.943 --> 05:21.696
I wish my boyfriend would've taken
his penis out of the girl.

05:21.779 --> 05:24.657
-Meaning, I wish he would've pulled out.
-Yeah, no, I got it.

05:25.491 --> 05:26.326
Thank you.

05:26.617 --> 05:27.994
Ooh, have I missed this!

05:28.077 --> 05:30.121
I'm gonna eat the shit
out of these hush puppies,

05:30.204 --> 05:32.915
and then tomorrow,
I'm getting a real sausage biscuit,

05:32.999 --> 05:34.459
meaning a sausage patty,

05:34.542 --> 05:37.879
not that bullshit link situation
they call "sausage" in LA.

05:37.962 --> 05:38.838
[both laughing]

05:38.921 --> 05:41.382
Oh, my goodness, I gotta pee.
I'll be right back.

05:41.632 --> 05:44.177
-[grunts, sighs]
-[phone buzzing, meowing]

05:47.555 --> 05:49.390
-Hello?
-Princess Carolyn!

05:49.474 --> 05:53.478
I just wanted to tell you what a ball
I'm having on this crazy cop show.

05:53.561 --> 05:54.395
Glad to hear it.

05:54.479 --> 05:57.690
And my favorite star paid
for a food truck.

05:57.774 --> 06:00.109
I don't know why Peter Scolari is buying
me a falafel plate,

06:00.193 --> 06:01.861
but, hey, I'm not complaining.

06:01.944 --> 06:03.821
-Did you have a question?
-Yeah.

06:03.905 --> 06:06.657
So, I know my ex-wife is
in the writers' room.

06:06.741 --> 06:11.037
I don't want to make things weird for her
or anybody else, so...

06:11.120 --> 06:14.582
do I have to do all the dialogue,
as scripted,

06:14.665 --> 06:16.501
or can I have a little fun with it?

06:16.584 --> 06:18.211
-Um--
-Normally, I wouldn't even ask,

06:18.294 --> 06:20.546
but because of the whole  ex-wife
of it all,

06:20.630 --> 06:23.466
I figured I should just double-check
that it's definitely okay

06:23.549 --> 06:25.218
if I change every single word.

06:25.301 --> 06:27.220
Knowing Flip,
I would just stick to the script.

06:27.303 --> 06:28.638
So, don't flip the script?

06:28.721 --> 06:31.766
-Exactly. Don't flip Flip's script.
- That's a double-flip.

06:31.849 --> 06:33.226
So, you're saying I should flip it?

06:33.309 --> 06:34.727
I'm saying the exact opposite.

06:34.811 --> 06:37.397
-So, flip it. Flip it good.
-Okay, I gotta go.

06:37.480 --> 06:41.067
You're very funny and talented.
Goodbye. Sorry. Show folk.

06:41.484 --> 06:44.404
Well, this was a pleasure.
Thanks for coming all this way.

06:44.487 --> 06:46.155
I do hope to make a decision soon.

06:46.239 --> 06:49.242
-Oh, you have to leave already?
-Yeah, I gotta go set up my booth.

06:49.325 --> 06:50.910
-Your booth?
-At the flea market.

06:50.993 --> 06:52.954
I sell clothes I bought cheap
and then bedazzled.

06:53.037 --> 06:55.123
I'm not saying I'm the Danville Target
or nothing,

06:55.206 --> 06:56.624
but it's good enough for fleas.

06:56.707 --> 06:58.543
Okay, call me if you have
any other questions.

06:58.626 --> 07:01.045
I always answer my phone,
day or night.

07:01.129 --> 07:01.963
Thanks.

07:04.424 --> 07:05.258
[bell jingles]

07:11.264 --> 07:15.309
-[water dripping]
-[grunting, sighs]

07:15.810 --> 07:17.770
Your mom's drunk again, isn't she?

07:18.020 --> 07:20.565
My mom, well, obviously she was planning
on cleaning the floors,

07:20.648 --> 07:22.275
but I asked her if I could do it.

07:22.358 --> 07:24.652
I wanna learn all the tricks of the trade,
so one day,

07:24.735 --> 07:26.529
I can be as good a housekeeper
as she is.

07:26.946 --> 07:28.990
Why do you still live here?

07:29.073 --> 07:31.200
Why don't you go live with your dad
down in Raleigh?

07:31.284 --> 07:32.910
All my sisters and brothers are gone.

07:32.994 --> 07:34.745
If I leave, my mom's got nobody.

07:34.829 --> 07:38.624
Besides, if I go,
who's going to keep you out of trouble?

07:38.791 --> 07:41.002
Did you know I'm on the football team?

07:41.085 --> 07:43.588
[chuckles] I do know it.
Are you ever gonna play?

07:43.671 --> 07:45.256
Probably not, smart-ass.

07:45.339 --> 07:47.967
Not unless the first-string quarterback
gets hurt.

07:48.050 --> 07:50.011
Why aren't you
the first-string quarterback?

07:50.094 --> 07:51.804
You're not even
first-string housekeeper!

07:51.888 --> 07:54.056
Well, how about I first-string punch you
in the nose?

07:54.140 --> 07:56.642
Oh! Okay, easy, easy.

07:56.726 --> 07:59.353
Look, I think if I just keep my head down
and be patient,

07:59.437 --> 08:01.939
Coach will eventually realize
I should be QB one, you know?

08:02.023 --> 08:03.816
That's a terrible approach.

08:03.900 --> 08:05.651
You need to go after what  you  want.

08:05.735 --> 08:08.779
You gotta fly into that sun,
like Amelia Earhart did.

08:08.863 --> 08:10.448
-What?
-You know, like in the movie.

08:10.531 --> 08:13.784
I never knew anybody who liked old movies
as much as you do.

08:13.868 --> 08:16.287
You're 18.
You never knew anybody, period.

08:16.370 --> 08:17.663
Okay, okay.

08:17.830 --> 08:21.000
But what if I'm not as good a quarterback
as I think I am?

08:21.083 --> 08:23.336
Doesn't matter.
You don't need to be good enough.

08:23.419 --> 08:25.671
You just need to convince your coach
you're good enough.

08:25.755 --> 08:27.381
Damn! You know what?

08:27.798 --> 08:30.801
-I'll talk to him tomorrow.
-Don't leave until you get that yes.

08:31.469 --> 08:34.430
-[bell jingling]
-Oh!

08:34.514 --> 08:35.806
[panting]

08:35.890 --> 08:38.518
-Sadie, wait!
-Oh. Um, hey.

08:38.601 --> 08:41.687
Listen, I really want to spend more time
getting to know each other.

08:41.771 --> 08:44.690
This baby, your baby,
means everything to me.

08:44.774 --> 08:46.692
I think the more time we spend together,

08:46.776 --> 08:48.486
-you'll realize I'm--
-[phone meowing]

08:48.569 --> 08:51.447
-Do you need to take that?
-No, it's fine. The perfect candidate.

08:51.531 --> 08:54.033
I thought you always answered your phone,
day or night.

08:54.116 --> 08:55.910
Right. Hello?

08:55.993 --> 08:57.495
I just got off the phone with Flip.

08:57.578 --> 09:00.748
He's really excited about
this new motorcycle stunt he came up with.

09:00.831 --> 09:04.418
-He wants to do it tomorrow, but--
-That's Flip, full of ideas. Gotta go.

09:04.502 --> 09:08.756
Well, the show is already way over budget
and my boss is starting to ask questions.

09:08.839 --> 09:12.343
Now, normally, I love questions
because they're good for pondering,

09:12.426 --> 09:14.095
but I guess in the corporate world,

09:14.178 --> 09:17.557
when people ask questions,
they expect someone to answer them.

09:17.640 --> 09:20.601
And, apparently,
"Yeah, wow, it really makes you think,"

09:20.685 --> 09:23.062
is not the kind of answer
they're looking for.

09:23.145 --> 09:24.063
Goodbye, Todd.

09:24.146 --> 09:25.439
- Wait, one more thing.
-What?

09:25.523 --> 09:29.402
Do you think Lake Erie ever gets jealous
of Lake Superior?

09:29.485 --> 09:32.321
Or is it, like, proud to be the eerie one?

09:32.405 --> 09:34.991
We've been through this, Todd.
Lakes don't have emotions.

09:35.074 --> 09:36.409
What about Ricki Lake?

09:36.826 --> 09:40.580
As I was saying, I'd love to spend
more time together, if you're up for it.

09:40.663 --> 09:43.040
You mentioned the flea market.
I'd love to check it out.

09:43.124 --> 09:45.876
-Yeah, come by anytime tomorrow.
-I thought it was today.

09:45.960 --> 09:47.878
No, no. I just have to prep for it today.

09:47.962 --> 09:50.256
But if you can stay another day,
that would be awesome.

09:50.339 --> 09:52.049
But only if you can. I know you're busy.

09:52.133 --> 09:55.428
I don't want me, or my baby,
to get in the way of your career.

09:56.345 --> 09:58.347
Sadie, I'll be there.

09:58.973 --> 10:00.266
[Sadie grunting]

10:00.349 --> 10:01.976
-[engine starts]
-Toodle-oos! [laughs]

10:02.059 --> 10:04.395
-[gasps] Ah! Oh!
-[phone dialing]

10:04.520 --> 10:08.232
Stuart, I need you to change my flight.
No, just do it through the website.

10:08.316 --> 10:11.444
Yeah, no, go to the website
and put in my confirmation number.

10:11.527 --> 10:13.487
Hold on, let me see if I can find it.

10:13.654 --> 10:15.531
It's 5-2-1-8.

10:15.615 --> 10:17.450
Change it to a Wednesday flight.

10:17.533 --> 10:20.786
No. Oh, okay, click "yes."
Click "yes."

10:20.870 --> 10:22.455
Okay, put in my credit card info.

10:22.538 --> 10:24.582
-I'll text you a picture.
-[camera shutter clicks]

10:24.665 --> 10:26.542
-[phone whooshes]
-Okay, did you get it?

10:26.626 --> 10:27.835
Check your work email.

10:27.918 --> 10:30.796
Okay, click "accept."
Now forward me the confirmation.

10:31.005 --> 10:33.716
Thank you, Stuart.
I don't know what I'd do without you.

10:33.924 --> 10:35.551
[deep breath, sighs]

10:37.011 --> 10:39.180
[Cooper humming] Ow!

10:39.263 --> 10:40.806
-Hey.
-Hey, yourself.

10:40.890 --> 10:43.309
Well, you've been up to something.

10:43.392 --> 10:47.688
I'm up to something, all right.
It's called first-string quarterback!

10:47.772 --> 10:49.482
-[cheering]
-Really?

10:49.565 --> 10:53.194
-I didn't leave until I got the yes.
-Oh, congratulations! Ah!

10:53.277 --> 10:54.695
-Oh!
-Oops. [chuckles]

10:54.779 --> 10:57.615
-Sorry. I got a little carried away there.
-That's okay.

10:57.698 --> 10:58.824
-[kisses] Oh!
-[gasps]

10:58.908 --> 11:00.242
-Sorry. Sorry.
-That's okay.

11:00.326 --> 11:02.036
[both laugh]

11:02.411 --> 11:04.288
[both moaning]

11:12.838 --> 11:16.300
[man on TV]  By Jove, she's doing it!
She's flying to the sun!

11:16.384 --> 11:18.010
That's where she's going.

11:18.094 --> 11:22.223
Now we don't need to be sad
when we think about her, later.

11:22.306 --> 11:25.309
-[mom snoring, TV playing]
-[switching off TV]

11:25.434 --> 11:28.562
-I'd be careful if I were you.
-What do you mean?

11:28.646 --> 11:30.940
Think I don't know what's going on?

11:31.023 --> 11:32.983
-Mom.
-Let me tell you something.

11:33.067 --> 11:35.277
Life is a big ol' roulette wheel.

11:35.361 --> 11:38.030
Everyone's got a number.
Some are winners, some aren't.

11:38.114 --> 11:40.658
It all depends
where the little white ball lands.

11:40.741 --> 11:44.203
The problem is when people
with losing numbers think they're winners.

11:44.286 --> 11:46.122
I don't know what you're talking about.

11:46.205 --> 11:48.791
-Then what the hell are these?
-College brochures. I--

11:48.874 --> 11:52.336
You think you're going
to some fancy college in California,

11:52.420 --> 11:55.464
all the way on the other side
of the country from your mother?

11:55.548 --> 11:57.800
-You're gonna abandon me?
-Mom, it's not about you.

11:57.883 --> 12:01.679
UCLA?
No, you will not see LA.

12:01.762 --> 12:04.974
Even if you get into one of these places,
how're you gonna pay for it?

12:05.057 --> 12:07.309
I'll get a job or a paid internship.

12:07.393 --> 12:11.313
Well, la-di-da, I did not realize
I was in the presence of someone,

12:11.397 --> 12:15.693
-who was gonna get a paid internship.
-Mom, you need to go to bed.

12:15.776 --> 12:18.821
See, that's the difference
between you and me, Princess Carolyn.

12:18.904 --> 12:21.824
I know where I belong.
This is my bed.

12:22.491 --> 12:23.993
No, it's not.
Where's my bed?

12:24.160 --> 12:27.079
-[phone buzzing, meowing]
-[mom, distorted] I know where I belong.

12:27.955 --> 12:29.832
-Hello?
- I thought you were gonna be here today.

12:29.915 --> 12:31.333
-Where are you?
-Something came up.

12:31.417 --> 12:34.128
Okay, well, listen, Mr. Peanutbutter's
doing all his own stunts,

12:34.211 --> 12:36.797
and every time he does
a dumb little somersault,

12:36.881 --> 12:39.216
everybody goes nuts
like he's goddamn Kerri Strug.

12:39.300 --> 12:41.469
Kerri Strug?
You gotta update your references.

12:41.552 --> 12:43.596
When the world sees
the likes of Kerri Strug, again,

12:43.679 --> 12:45.139
I will adjust accordingly.

12:45.222 --> 12:47.391
Anyway, I said I wanted to do
my own stunts, too,

12:47.475 --> 12:50.019
but little did I know
that Flip was writing a new scene,

12:50.102 --> 12:52.855
where a motorcycle falls off
a five-story building.

12:52.938 --> 12:54.273
Just say you don't want to do it.

12:54.356 --> 12:57.234
I cannot do that
because I already fired my stunt double,

12:57.318 --> 12:59.570
so I also need you to call him
and get him back,

12:59.653 --> 13:02.406
and that might be tricky,
'cause I was really brutal about it.

13:02.490 --> 13:04.325
-Why?
-Because people were watching.

13:04.408 --> 13:07.495
Now I need you to intervene
and forbid me from doing my own stunts,

13:07.578 --> 13:09.997
even though I want to,
because I actually don't want to,

13:10.080 --> 13:13.209
because that would require me to be
in good shape, which we know I'm not,

13:13.292 --> 13:15.294
and also not a coward,
which we both know I am.

13:15.377 --> 13:16.796
-BoJack--
- Also, if you could say

13:16.879 --> 13:19.340
it's because I'm too important a star
to take the risk on,

13:19.423 --> 13:21.217
but Mr. Peanutbutter can keep doing
his stunts

13:21.300 --> 13:24.178
because he is less important;
that would be real cool, thanks.

13:24.261 --> 13:25.429
Fine, I'll handle it!

13:25.513 --> 13:27.723
Just stop whining like a little bitch!

13:29.099 --> 13:31.477
[laughs]
Okay, love you, bitch!

13:31.560 --> 13:32.394
-[beep]
-Hey, girl!

13:32.478 --> 13:35.105
Hey! I'm so glad you came.
This is my stuff.

13:35.189 --> 13:37.233
-I call it Made-y by Sadie.
-Wow!

13:37.316 --> 13:39.151
Problem is got a bunch of lookie-loos.

13:39.235 --> 13:41.028
Everyone's browsing,
but no one's buying.

13:41.111 --> 13:43.572
It's not about people buying.
it's about you selling.

13:43.656 --> 13:44.490
Watch this.

13:44.573 --> 13:46.784
Whoa!
Hey, you can't get that jacket.

13:46.867 --> 13:48.786
-Why not?
-I was gonna get it.

13:48.869 --> 13:51.789
It's the best thing in this whole place
and I saw it first.

13:51.872 --> 13:54.542
So, why don't you make like yourself
and flee?

13:54.625 --> 13:56.961
I got it now.
Maybe I'm gonna buy it.

13:57.044 --> 13:58.754
-[grunts]
-Five dollars.

13:59.922 --> 14:01.966
[gasps] Oh, my God!

14:02.049 --> 14:03.592
Sadie, you can sell anything,

14:03.676 --> 14:06.720
if you just sell people the idea
that they're not being sold to.

14:06.804 --> 14:09.056
Wow!
That's pretty manipulative.

14:09.139 --> 14:11.642
But I didn't need to
because your clothing sells itself.

14:11.725 --> 14:13.644
Hey, I guess you're right.

14:13.727 --> 14:15.229
[groans] My back aches.

14:15.312 --> 14:16.939
-I gotta sit down.
-Oh!

14:18.065 --> 14:19.692
-Here.
-[bear growls]

14:20.109 --> 14:21.193
Smart move adopting.

14:21.277 --> 14:23.404
Let someone else do all the work, right?
[chuckles]

14:23.487 --> 14:25.281
Girl, you do not wanna be pregnant.

14:28.826 --> 14:30.578
Ugh! What am I gonna do?

14:30.661 --> 14:32.037
My life's over.

14:32.121 --> 14:34.748
No! Are you kidding?
This is a good thing.

14:34.832 --> 14:38.210
-That boy's stuck with you, now.
-Stuck with me?

14:38.294 --> 14:40.838
No, good stuck,
like when you try on

14:40.921 --> 14:43.048
your friend's fancy ring
and it won't come off.

14:43.132 --> 14:44.508
Now you got a free ring.

14:44.592 --> 14:46.844
You know, Evelyn still expects you
to give that ring back.

14:46.927 --> 14:48.512
That sounds like an Evelyn problem.

14:48.596 --> 14:52.850
Meanwhile, that little white roulette ball
just landed on your number.

14:52.933 --> 14:55.019
You know the Wallaces are good people.

14:55.102 --> 14:57.563
-They're gonna do right by you.
-[sobbing]

14:57.646 --> 14:58.856
No, don't cry. Look.

14:58.939 --> 15:01.358
They're gonna have you move
into the big house,

15:01.442 --> 15:03.319
probably in the big room.

15:03.402 --> 15:05.696
You know, the one with all the dolls.

15:05.779 --> 15:08.490
And I'll be right up here
whenever you need me.

15:09.158 --> 15:11.660
Hey, I wanna give you this.

15:12.036 --> 15:14.079
Did you steal this from Evelyn, too?

15:14.163 --> 15:18.709
Your... grammy gave me this necklace
when I first got pregnant.

15:18.792 --> 15:21.420
It's been in our family for generations.

15:21.503 --> 15:23.255
It's from the old country.

15:23.339 --> 15:24.465
And when you wear this,

15:24.548 --> 15:28.594
I want you to remember that you've come
from a long line of women,

15:28.677 --> 15:32.514
who've taken our licks,
but we always land on our feet.

15:33.766 --> 15:35.768
-Don't we?
-[grunts]

15:35.851 --> 15:37.895
Now listen to me. This is our shot.

15:38.228 --> 15:41.148
-Don't blow it, okay?
-[sniffles] Okay.

15:41.982 --> 15:42.983
[Sadie]  Princess Carolyn?

15:44.401 --> 15:46.904
-Yeah.
-Would you want to meet my family?

15:47.237 --> 15:49.323
-Of course.
-There's a potluck at the church, tonight.

15:49.406 --> 15:53.452
-I love a church potluck!
-Oh! What church do you go to in LA?

15:53.535 --> 15:58.457
Oh, uh, St. Mary's Good Shepherd
of the Lady... of the Passion...

15:58.540 --> 16:03.963
of the Constant Gardener...
of Latter-Day Belle and Sebastian.

16:04.046 --> 16:06.715
You got time for that, but you can't say
"California Pizza Kitchen"?

16:06.840 --> 16:08.801
I love church and I love the Lord.

16:08.884 --> 16:10.302
God is my back-door pilot.

16:10.552 --> 16:12.346
I wish Strib was a back-door pilot.

16:12.429 --> 16:14.723
Maybe then I wouldn't be pregnant.
[chuckles]

16:14.932 --> 16:16.433
-[whispers] Anal sex.
-Got it.

16:18.477 --> 16:20.270
[chatter]

16:20.354 --> 16:22.982
That's my mom. That woman's been banged
more times than a screen door

16:23.065 --> 16:24.191
during hurricane season.

16:24.274 --> 16:25.609
-Oh!
-But I love her.

16:25.693 --> 16:26.902
That's my sister Tanya.

16:26.986 --> 16:28.153
Thinks she's so smart.

16:28.237 --> 16:29.613
If you're so smart, Tanya,

16:29.697 --> 16:31.699
why do you live
on a dry-docked pontoon boat?

16:31.782 --> 16:33.826
-Good one!
-She's got a great heart.

16:33.909 --> 16:36.036
And, finally, the cousins.
I've slept with all of them.

16:36.120 --> 16:37.121
-Wow!
-I'm just kidding.

16:37.204 --> 16:39.456
-I'm from North Carolina, not Tennessee.
-[laughing]

16:39.540 --> 16:43.836
Hope you like ambrosia, since everyone
brought the exact same dish; ambrosia.

16:43.919 --> 16:45.379
Ah, it's beautiful out here.

16:45.587 --> 16:47.339
Look at all those stars!

16:47.423 --> 16:50.175
-You don't have stars in LA?
-Not like these.

16:50.259 --> 16:51.635
Too much light pollution.

16:51.719 --> 16:53.012
And heavy pollution.

16:57.224 --> 16:59.351
[Princess Carolyn shivering]

17:01.937 --> 17:04.898
[sighs]
My dad's ready to see you.

17:05.357 --> 17:06.483
[sighs]

17:06.775 --> 17:08.527
-We better not.
-[groans]

17:11.280 --> 17:12.698
[Mr. Wallace clearing throat]

17:13.240 --> 17:18.162
Oh, I gotta tell you, when my idiot son
told me he'd knocked up the help, I...

17:19.079 --> 17:20.205
Let me try that again.

17:20.289 --> 17:23.417
Princess Carolyn,
we're going to do the right thing, here.

17:23.500 --> 17:25.919
You'll have a lovely wedding
before you start to show.

17:26.003 --> 17:28.255
If it's a girl, we'll name her Dorothy
after my mother.

17:28.338 --> 17:31.717
Of course, if it's a boy, he'll be
the third Cooper Thomas Rogers Wallace,

17:31.800 --> 17:35.637
so you'll call him Cooper III,
or Cooper Three, Trip, Trey or Lil' Coop.

17:35.721 --> 17:38.223
You'll join the Junior League,
maybe sing in the Follies.

17:38.307 --> 17:40.100
Mrs. Wallace will teach you
how to play bridge

17:40.184 --> 17:43.228
and destroy other families' social status
through indelicate gossip.

17:43.312 --> 17:45.064
-Oh...
-We'll go to Hilton Head every summer

17:45.147 --> 17:47.983
and take a photo of all of us on the beach
wearing khaki and white.

17:48.067 --> 17:49.443
This will be our Christmas card.

17:49.526 --> 17:52.613
Inside, it will say "Merry Merry"
or "Seasons Greetings,"

17:52.696 --> 17:54.948
so as not to alienate our friends
of other faiths,

17:55.032 --> 17:56.575
but we'll know it's Christmas.

17:57.201 --> 17:59.078
Princess Carolyn, I know you're scared,

17:59.161 --> 18:02.164
but I promise you,
you've got a great life ahead of you.

18:02.498 --> 18:05.584
No worries, no tough choices
and no money troubles,

18:05.667 --> 18:08.921
thanks to the Wallace and Sons
Answering Machine Tape empire.

18:09.004 --> 18:13.092
Yes, as long as people need answering
machine tapes, you will be taken care of.

18:13.175 --> 18:14.676
-Sound good?
-Yes.

18:14.760 --> 18:16.929
Ah, ah, ah. Wait for the beep.

18:17.012 --> 18:19.056
Sound good? Beep!

18:19.598 --> 18:21.767
-Yes, sir.
-[phone buzzing, meowing]

18:21.850 --> 18:23.977
[back to present time] Hello?

18:24.061 --> 18:26.146
Princess Carolyn,
there's been an accident.

18:26.230 --> 18:27.940
BoJack's hurt real bad.

18:28.023 --> 18:30.067
Ow! I'm in so much pain.

18:30.150 --> 18:32.027
I'm like Kerri Strug over here.

18:32.152 --> 18:34.113
Where's my big Russian guy?

18:34.196 --> 18:35.114
What happened?

18:35.197 --> 18:37.783
- He fell off a building is what happened.
-Oh!

18:37.866 --> 18:38.700
Are you okay?

18:38.784 --> 18:42.871
I mean, I know you're not  okay, okay,
but you're  okay,  right?

18:42.955 --> 18:44.873
Why did you let him do his own stunts?

18:44.957 --> 18:47.334
-That was today?
-Of course it was today.

18:47.417 --> 18:50.379
I put a sticky on your day page
at our sister site

18:50.462 --> 18:52.548
WhatDateIsItRightNow.net.

18:52.631 --> 18:55.676
-Oh!
-Do you even check your day page?

18:55.759 --> 18:58.428
Every part of me hurts.
Sartre was wrong.

18:58.512 --> 19:02.224
Physical pain is so much worse
than prolonged emotional distress.

19:02.307 --> 19:04.184
What a hack!

19:04.268 --> 19:07.688
We're supposed to be shooting, all week.
You're behind schedule and over budget.

19:07.771 --> 19:09.606
I'm sending you the number
of a specialist.

19:09.690 --> 19:12.401
He can fix BoJack up
and inject him full of enough pep

19:12.484 --> 19:14.361
to keep things together
until end of production.

19:14.444 --> 19:16.572
-Sadie!
-[mother] No, no, no, no, Strib!

19:16.655 --> 19:17.781
[sister] Go away!

19:17.865 --> 19:19.491
-So I call this number--
-[phone beeps]

19:19.575 --> 19:21.201
Strib, what are you doing here?

19:21.285 --> 19:24.538
I mean, I guess I was wrong, maybe.
Maybe you don't give the baby away.

19:24.621 --> 19:27.332
Like, maybe keep it.
I mean, I guess I could marry you.

19:27.416 --> 19:29.293
Have a family and stuff. I don't know!

19:29.376 --> 19:31.712
A grand gesture?
This is like a fairy tale!

19:31.795 --> 19:33.505
Strib, I can't do this again.

19:33.589 --> 19:37.634
-Come on. I love you or whatever.
-Go to him, Sadie. He loves you.

19:37.718 --> 19:40.137
Don't listen to her, Sadie.
She lives in a pontoon boat.

19:40.220 --> 19:42.723
Y'all gonna be beggin' for a ride
when the flood comes.

19:42.806 --> 19:45.392
-Oh, my God.
-Somebody gotta get him outta here.

19:45.475 --> 19:48.896
-[people arguing]
-Hey! Sadie? Sadie.

19:48.979 --> 19:50.647
[voices overlapping]

19:53.650 --> 19:57.321
You blew it!
We were this close, and you blew it.

19:57.404 --> 19:59.865
-[sighs] Mom.
-What the hell happened?

19:59.948 --> 20:03.744
You eat a pineapple or something?
Put something up there you shouldn't have?

20:03.827 --> 20:06.413
No. It just--
I don't know, it just happened.

20:06.496 --> 20:10.209
Miscarriages don't "just happen."
This was our ticket.

20:10.292 --> 20:12.961
That baby would've changed
everything for us.

20:13.045 --> 20:16.632
[sobs] I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry!

20:16.715 --> 20:19.092
[sighs] It's not your fault.

20:19.760 --> 20:22.221
We just got losing numbers.

20:22.304 --> 20:24.681
Well, maybe Cooper will marry me, anyway?

20:24.765 --> 20:28.644
Oh, sweetie, you've been watching
too many of those old movies.

20:28.727 --> 20:31.188
Coopers don't marry gals like you.

20:31.271 --> 20:35.859
He's gonna end up with some fancy heiress,
like Samantha Floppy-Disk.

20:35.943 --> 20:38.570
Besides, you don't want that life.

20:38.654 --> 20:41.573
-You're free now.
-Free to do what?

20:42.532 --> 20:46.286
I wasn't gonna tell you,
but this came in the mail.

20:46.370 --> 20:47.204
[gasps]

20:52.125 --> 20:53.710
[phone buzzing, meowing]

20:53.794 --> 20:56.380
-Hello?
-I guess you heard about BoJack?

20:56.588 --> 20:58.590
-Yeah.
-This is all my fault.

20:58.674 --> 21:00.550
I thought the stunt was Flip's idea.

21:00.634 --> 21:03.345
Well, no, I just convinced him
it was his idea.

21:03.428 --> 21:07.015
That's not what I heard.
I heard it was Flip's idea.

21:07.099 --> 21:09.017
-Right, but that's just--
-It was Flip's idea.

21:09.101 --> 21:10.227
How are you not getting this?

21:10.310 --> 21:12.354
Do you only seem smart
because you wear glasses?

21:12.437 --> 21:15.857
[sighs] Okay, it was Flip's idea.

21:16.066 --> 21:17.276
Great. I'll see you tomorrow.

21:17.359 --> 21:18.902
-Hey.
-Hey.

21:19.653 --> 21:23.407
Listen, I've known me some Stribs.
A little sweet, a little dangerous.

21:23.490 --> 21:25.826
But the second things get complicated,
he'll run away.

21:25.909 --> 21:29.037
-You don't know my Strib.
-But I know you. And you are too special

21:29.121 --> 21:31.415
to settle for the first guy
who rolls up on a motorcycle

21:31.498 --> 21:33.292
and says, [drawls]
"I love you or whatever."

21:33.500 --> 21:36.295
Well, I haven't decided
what I'm gonna do yet anyway.

21:36.378 --> 21:38.964
You're a bright girl,
and you've got an incredible future.

21:39.047 --> 21:42.217
Let me ask you something.
Did you really like the clothes I made?

21:42.301 --> 21:43.468
Of course I did.

21:43.552 --> 21:45.971
Then why didn't you buy anything
for yourself?

21:46.096 --> 21:48.181
-Sadie...
-You're bullshitting me.

21:48.265 --> 21:50.350
-This is just another sale for you.
-No.

21:50.434 --> 21:53.395
You think I'm stupid,
but I've been watching you bullshit,

21:53.478 --> 21:54.813
everyone on that phone of yours.

21:54.896 --> 21:58.400
I want to give your baby the best life,
the best schools, the best opportunities--

21:58.483 --> 22:00.319
You think, because you left her,
you're better.

22:00.402 --> 22:03.113
Because of your fancy show business,
you can take whatever you want.

22:03.196 --> 22:06.616
-No, no, no, you don't understand.
-Well, I got something you can't have,

22:06.700 --> 22:10.037
and no amount of your managing
or producing is gonna change that.

22:10.120 --> 22:13.415
I just want to help you.
I want to give your baby a better life.

22:13.498 --> 22:15.292
Better than what?

22:16.251 --> 22:18.170
Better than a sky fulla stars?

22:18.545 --> 22:19.963
[sighs]

22:20.589 --> 22:24.259
[deep breath] Okay, Sadie,
you do whatever you want.

22:24.968 --> 22:26.428
You want to keep the baby,

22:26.511 --> 22:28.847
you want to give the baby
to someone else, fine.

22:28.930 --> 22:30.766
Just do, what  you  want to do.

22:30.849 --> 22:34.811
Don't live your life for Strib,
or this baby, or anybody else.

22:35.312 --> 22:37.898
-I know that.
-Okay. Good.

22:39.399 --> 22:41.318
-Thank you.
-I mean it.

22:44.863 --> 22:46.865
[sign grinds]

22:48.450 --> 22:50.494
-[phone buzzing, meowing]
-Hello?

22:50.619 --> 22:53.914
So, I just got the word from Sadie.

22:54.414 --> 22:57.209
-She's gonna keep looking.
-Okay.

22:57.292 --> 23:00.670
Ugh! I'm sorry.
This is the hardest part of my job,

23:00.754 --> 23:03.465
when I have to lie to the clients
and tell them it's not their fault.

23:03.548 --> 23:06.635
-Thank you, Tracy.
-It's not your fault.

23:06.718 --> 23:08.136
-Goodbye, Tracy.
-[phone beeps]

23:08.762 --> 23:09.596
[sighs]

23:15.685 --> 23:18.146
-[chattering]
-[planes landing and taking off]

23:18.438 --> 23:19.689
[phone buzzing, meowing]

23:19.773 --> 23:23.485
BoJack, I am so sorry.
This was all my fault.

23:23.652 --> 23:26.446
Uh, it's your fault I feel amazing?

23:26.530 --> 23:28.240
I don't know what that doctor gave me,

23:28.323 --> 23:32.119
but, man, you should leave town
more often.

23:32.244 --> 23:34.579
Hey, quick question... is this a train?

23:34.663 --> 23:35.622
I'm on my way home.

23:35.705 --> 23:37.749
I'll come check on you
as soon as I get there.

23:37.833 --> 23:39.709
Hey, I'm golden. Let me tell you.

23:39.793 --> 23:42.087
You accidentally drive a motorcycle
off a building,

23:42.170 --> 23:44.714
and suddenly
you are everybody's favorite guy.

23:44.798 --> 23:47.592
We did it, Princess Carolyn. Back on top!

23:47.801 --> 23:49.636
-[phone beeps]
-[sighs]

23:55.142 --> 23:57.894
[announcer]  Flight 29 to Los Angeles,
say your goodbyes.

23:57.978 --> 24:00.021
- This is the final call for boarding.
-[mom grunts]

24:00.105 --> 24:02.232
Okay. Bye, Mom. Ooh!

24:02.315 --> 24:05.861
Hey, I got a nutty idea.
What if you deferred for a year?

24:05.944 --> 24:07.779
Mom, I-I can't do that.

24:07.863 --> 24:11.783
Of course you could.
Los Angeles isn't going nowhere.

24:11.867 --> 24:13.076
Just another year.

24:13.160 --> 24:17.038
By that time, Boots will be out of rehab,
and he can come home, and help out.

24:17.122 --> 24:19.791
-Just wait until then.
-Mom, please.

24:19.875 --> 24:22.043
A year. You'll hardly notice it.

24:22.127 --> 24:25.297
-No, Mom. I gotta go.
-Please?

24:25.714 --> 24:28.633
Can't you just do this one thing for me?

24:29.926 --> 24:31.178
I'm sorry, Mom.
