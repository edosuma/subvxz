WEBVTT

00:00.551 --> 00:02.218
<i>So here's what you missed</i>
<i>on</i> Glee: <i> Sue got fired</i>

00:02.252 --> 00:03.719
<i>from McKinley, so now she's</i>

00:03.754 --> 00:05.421
<i>at Carmel High
coaching Vocal Adrenaline.</i>

00:05.456 --> 00:07.356
<i>Dalton Academy burnt down,
and all the Warblers</i>

00:07.391 --> 00:09.192
<i>came to McKinley, which is good
because the New Directions!</i>

00:09.226 --> 00:10.860
<i>Didn't have enough kids,
and if they don't win,</i>

00:10.894 --> 00:12.695
<i>the glee club's over,
but it might be anyway</i>

00:12.730 --> 00:14.263
<i>because Rachel got
accepted back at NYADA</i>

00:14.298 --> 00:15.932
<i>and got offered
a role on Broadway.</i>

00:15.966 --> 00:17.926
<i>And that's what you missed</i>
<i>on</i> Glee.

00:20.178 --> 00:22.012
All right, I don't care
what the body's doing.

00:22.046 --> 00:24.181
Just make sure the <i> facce</i>
is doing something special.

00:24.215 --> 00:26.516
A five, six, seven, eight.

00:26.551 --> 00:28.719
Show it. Hide it.

00:28.753 --> 00:30.854
Hit your friend,
hit your friend.

00:30.888 --> 00:33.724
- Grab the jelly... - Good, you guys.
Remember, show faces.

00:33.758 --> 00:36.526
Make a sandwich, throw it down.
Stay at home, stay at home.

00:36.561 --> 00:38.328
Leave your home, seven, eight.

00:38.363 --> 00:40.497
Twinkle, twinkle, little star.

00:40.531 --> 00:42.933
Mother, may I point to you?

00:42.967 --> 00:45.002
- All right, not bad, guys.
- Yay! That was so good, you guys!

00:45.036 --> 00:46.236
Let's take five.

00:46.270 --> 00:48.238
Uh, no, no, no.
Let's not take five.

00:48.272 --> 00:50.674
- Excuse me? - My feet are like
an outtake from <i> Black Swan,</i>

00:50.708 --> 00:53.010
but you don't hear me
complaining...

00:53.044 --> 00:55.846
Because my fellow Warblers and I
understand the stakes involved.

00:55.880 --> 00:58.360
May I remind you that if
we don't win sectionals,

00:58.383 --> 01:00.884
Glee Club no longer exists.

01:00.918 --> 01:02.386
Do you think
Sue Sylvester is giving

01:02.420 --> 01:04.888
Vocal Adrenaline
a five minute break? No.

01:04.922 --> 01:07.924
This weekend, I saw them
walking on hot coals.

01:07.959 --> 01:09.960
(all screaming)

01:11.396 --> 01:13.797
If Oprah can do this,
so can you.

01:17.001 --> 01:18.735
- We suck!
- Okay, you suck!

01:18.770 --> 01:20.470
Take a nap, Nickelodeon.

01:20.505 --> 01:21.938
(all arguing indistinctly)

01:21.973 --> 01:24.041
- Relax.
- KURT: Come on, guys.

01:24.075 --> 01:25.809
Everyone's improving
very nicely.

01:25.843 --> 01:27.878
This is not the time to panic.

01:27.912 --> 01:29.713
But it is time to be pragmatic.

01:29.747 --> 01:31.615
With all due respect
to our well-meaning teachers,

01:31.649 --> 01:34.584
there is zero chance
of beating Vocal Adrenaline

01:34.619 --> 01:37.554
with rudimentary moves like
"Mother, may I point

01:37.588 --> 01:38.722
to you?"

01:38.756 --> 01:40.223
- I love that move.
- It's awesome.

01:40.258 --> 01:42.259
- Thank you.
- Moreover, the Warblers and I

01:42.293 --> 01:44.394
recently had a little sidebar,
and we believe it's time

01:44.429 --> 01:46.964
for a frank discussion about
who should be featured up front.

01:46.998 --> 01:48.665
And who should be...

01:48.700 --> 01:50.100
- hidden in the back.
- JANE: No.

01:50.134 --> 01:51.802
The only three girls
in this group

01:51.836 --> 01:53.070
are not moving to the back.

01:53.104 --> 01:54.504
Nope.

01:54.539 --> 01:56.073
- Uh-uh.
- Oh, no, no, no.

01:56.107 --> 01:57.274
I wasn't talking
about the girls.

01:57.308 --> 01:59.476
I was talking about...

01:59.510 --> 02:01.078
Just say it, Skyler.

02:01.112 --> 02:02.980
The dead weight.

02:03.014 --> 02:05.494
Look, we all know that some of
us aren't as physically fit

02:05.516 --> 02:08.018
as others, but give
Roderick some time.

02:08.051 --> 02:10.320
He's got a killer voice
and he's a quick learner.

02:10.354 --> 02:12.189
I guarantee he can get
the dance moves, dude.

02:12.223 --> 02:13.290
And when will you
get them, dude?

02:13.324 --> 02:14.524
You're just as bad as he is.

02:14.559 --> 02:15.592
You're worse!

02:15.627 --> 02:17.260
You dance like a blind man

02:17.295 --> 02:18.762
with a back brace
who hasn't taken

02:18.796 --> 02:20.530
a dump in three weeks!

02:20.565 --> 02:21.865
Hey, I don't have to dance good.

02:21.899 --> 02:23.267
I just need to look good,
and I do.

02:23.301 --> 02:24.501
Get over yourself!

02:24.535 --> 02:26.169
We all look good.

02:26.204 --> 02:28.105
Even Julianne Moore over there.

02:28.139 --> 02:29.640
Order, order, gentlemen.
What?

02:29.674 --> 02:32.276
Look, I have to agree
with super gay Warbler.

02:32.310 --> 02:35.279
I love you guys, but we
just can't afford to lose.

02:35.313 --> 02:37.915
So, unless you magically get
better, like, this second,

02:37.949 --> 02:39.349
then I think you should

02:39.384 --> 02:41.384
take one for the team
and maybe just...

02:41.386 --> 02:43.186
stay hidden in the back row.

(school bell ringing)

02:56.935 --> 02:58.302
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm...

02:58.336 --> 02:59.670
I'm fine.

02:59.704 --> 03:00.737
No, you're a mess.

03:00.772 --> 03:02.639
Let me help you with that.

03:02.674 --> 03:04.741
Thanks.

03:04.776 --> 03:06.977
How the hell are we supposed
to get this routine down

03:07.011 --> 03:08.545
if I can't even
get through my day

03:08.580 --> 03:10.013
without tripping over myself?

03:10.048 --> 03:11.548
We're screwed.

03:11.583 --> 03:13.584
I feel like a hippo
trying to do ballet

03:13.618 --> 03:16.420
like some strange nightmare
out of <i> Fantasia.</i>

03:16.454 --> 03:18.355
I know, man. I got
moves on the field,

03:18.389 --> 03:20.357
but I can't seem to get these
dance moves down. It's...

03:20.391 --> 03:22.326
right, left,
right, left... Yeah?

03:22.360 --> 03:23.894
No, I thought it was
left and then right.

03:23.928 --> 03:25.696
Well... I don't know.

03:25.730 --> 03:27.164
I mean, how are we supposed
to get through this routine

03:27.198 --> 03:28.532
if neither one of us
actually even knows it?

03:28.566 --> 03:29.600
I mean, we need
someone to help us.

03:29.634 --> 03:31.034
- Maybe Alistair can...
- No.

03:31.069 --> 03:32.536
No, I'm sorry.
I just don't want

03:32.570 --> 03:34.171
- to watch you two make
out all weekend. - Yeah.

03:34.205 --> 03:36.039
But we got to have someone
to whip us into shape.

03:36.074 --> 03:37.274
Well, how about Mr. Shue, then?

03:37.308 --> 03:38.675
He's the best dancer.

03:38.710 --> 03:40.677
We need his moves,
but he'll just

03:40.712 --> 03:43.113
tell us he's proud of us even
when we're doing a subpar job.

03:43.147 --> 03:44.414
Who we really need...

03:44.449 --> 03:45.849
- is Kitty.
- Is Kitty.

03:45.884 --> 03:47.784
I mean, she's by far
our harshest critic.

03:47.819 --> 03:49.086
And a true taskmaster.

03:49.120 --> 03:50.420
She'll make at least
one of us cry.

03:50.455 --> 03:51.889
Yeah.

03:51.923 --> 03:53.223
I'll see you later.
(school bell rings)

03:53.258 --> 03:54.525
Want to do that.

03:54.559 --> 03:56.393
And try this one second.

03:56.427 --> 03:58.595
Hey, uh, Rachel, do you have
a second to go over this list?

03:58.630 --> 04:00.297
I-I-I thought that Kurt

04:00.331 --> 04:02.533
- had the set list for sectionals
nailed down. - Uh, yeah.

04:02.567 --> 04:04.034
No, this is a list of performers

04:04.068 --> 04:05.802
that, uh, finished
their college degrees

04:05.837 --> 04:07.371
before they actually...

04:07.405 --> 04:09.406
Sam...
jumped to Broadway or Hollywood.

04:09.440 --> 04:10.874
We talked about this, okay?
You were very clear

04:10.909 --> 04:11.975
about how you felt,
and I'm very clear

04:12.010 --> 04:13.076
about how I feel.

04:13.111 --> 04:14.912
Patti LuPone, Carrie Underwood,

04:14.946 --> 04:17.147
- Meryl Streep.
- Okay, look. You know what?

04:17.182 --> 04:19.249
I knew you were gonna do this,
so I made a list of all

04:19.284 --> 04:20.983
the performers who either
dropped out of college

04:21.019 --> 04:23.287
or who didn't go at all, and
who had very successful careers.

04:23.321 --> 04:25.055
Here you go... Lady
Gaga, Coco Chanel

04:25.089 --> 04:27.224
and Miss Barbra
Streisand herself.

04:27.258 --> 04:29.259
I know you, so I made
this list of people

04:29.294 --> 04:31.461
that dropped out
and were huge for five minutes,

04:31.496 --> 04:32.963
but then were
never heard of again.

04:32.997 --> 04:34.832
Kesha.

04:34.866 --> 04:36.900
- Kesha's still performing.
- Okay, well, my bad. I'm just...

04:36.935 --> 04:38.469
Sam, please, look.

04:38.503 --> 04:40.270
I hear you, okay?

04:40.305 --> 04:42.272
And you're being a
really good friend.

04:42.307 --> 04:44.408
I just... I don't want to
talk about this anymore

04:44.442 --> 04:47.311
unless you support
my choice, okay?

04:47.345 --> 04:48.812
All right.

04:48.847 --> 04:51.615
You know...

04:51.649 --> 04:53.350
we all support you.

04:53.384 --> 04:54.785
Okay, we always do.

04:54.819 --> 04:57.821
Just please, think
about the future, okay?

04:57.856 --> 04:59.123
And not just, like,
the next month

04:59.157 --> 05:00.691
or the next big
ticket out of here,

05:00.725 --> 05:02.359
but actually look
back at yourself

05:02.393 --> 05:03.994
from the future and ask

05:04.028 --> 05:06.530
if dropping out of NYADA was
something you're proud of.

05:14.672 --> 05:16.473
Hmm.

05:18.009 --> 05:20.411

07:24.169 --> 07:26.070
- Hmm.
- What are you doing here?

07:26.104 --> 07:28.238
I'm from here, remember?

07:28.273 --> 07:30.140
And I'm just in town
for a couple of days.

07:30.175 --> 07:32.810
My mom is getting a tummy tuck
and a little eye work done.

07:32.844 --> 07:35.579
So... I thought she could use
a little help around the house.

07:35.614 --> 07:37.681
The real question is,
Rachel Berry...

07:37.716 --> 07:39.450
what are you doing here?

07:39.484 --> 07:41.518
What? I'm coaching
the glee club.

07:41.553 --> 07:43.754
Yeah, we're-we're cramming
for sectionals right now, so...

07:43.788 --> 07:45.456
Well, I heard you were
offered a new role

07:45.490 --> 07:47.658
in the Russell Simmons musical
opposite one of Broadway's

07:47.692 --> 07:49.627
hottest up-and-coming young
actors, but that the producers

07:49.661 --> 07:51.261
are still waiting
to hear back from you.

07:51.296 --> 07:52.696
Wait, how do you know that?

07:52.731 --> 07:54.298
Because I'm the hot
up-and-coming young actor

07:54.332 --> 07:56.500
that you're going
to play opposite of.

07:56.534 --> 07:57.968
You're playing Tino?

07:58.003 --> 07:59.770
The Iraqi War vet who was
discharged for covering

07:59.804 --> 08:01.804
the American embassy
with the graffiti that he used

08:01.806 --> 08:03.674
to make him a famous
Philly street artist,

08:03.708 --> 08:05.476
and when he comes home
crippled with PTSD,

08:05.510 --> 08:07.945
it's only his love of hip-hop
that can save his life?

08:07.979 --> 08:08.979
(laughs) Yeah.

08:09.014 --> 08:10.681
The producer spent a month

08:10.715 --> 08:12.850
trying the cast the role
of Segovia Shade

08:12.884 --> 08:14.485
until I finally reminded them

08:14.519 --> 08:16.487
they found their Segovia Shade.

08:16.521 --> 08:19.023
She auditioned for them.
Her name is Rachel Berry.

08:19.057 --> 08:21.692
Jessie, I really appreciate you
doing that for me,

08:21.726 --> 08:24.962
but I just... I-I haven't
made up my mind yet.

08:24.996 --> 08:26.676
Rachel...
(quiet laugh)

08:26.698 --> 08:28.499
It's really fun to come home
every now and again

08:28.533 --> 08:30.467
and coach a glee club or...

08:30.502 --> 08:32.469
in my case, help your mom
use her grabber tool

08:32.504 --> 08:34.972
to pull a box of cereal
off the top of the fridge,

08:35.006 --> 08:37.508
but you and I both know
that you belong on Broadway.

08:37.542 --> 08:39.309
You need to get your ass
back to New York.

08:39.344 --> 08:41.044
I am going back to New York.
Right after sectionals.

08:41.078 --> 08:42.645
I just don't know yet if
it's gonna be for college

08:42.681 --> 08:43.921
or for Broadway.

08:43.948 --> 08:44.982
(laughs):
What?!

08:45.016 --> 08:46.183
You can't be serious.

08:46.217 --> 08:47.685
Look, my career was on track.

08:47.719 --> 08:49.887
And then I dropped out of NYADA,

08:49.921 --> 08:51.522
and-and my whole
life fell apart.

08:51.556 --> 08:53.490
So now I have the chance
to rectify that mistake

08:53.525 --> 08:56.393
by going back to college, so
what if that's the right choice?

08:56.428 --> 08:58.495
Rachel, your mistake
was not leaving NYADA.

08:58.530 --> 09:00.231
You got the lead role
in <i> Funny Girl.</i>

09:00.265 --> 09:02.032
Nobody could've expected you
to turn that down.

09:02.067 --> 09:04.001
Your mistake was leaving
the show too early

09:04.035 --> 09:05.736
to do that stupid sitcom.

09:05.770 --> 09:09.373
Look, I'm sure that NYADA
is a great place, and maybe

09:09.407 --> 09:10.687
it's because I'm a little biased

09:10.709 --> 09:12.076
because she personally
rejected me,

09:12.110 --> 09:14.545
but unless you want
to be Carmen Tibideaux

09:14.579 --> 09:17.081
and run a school that claims
to be the nation's top

09:17.115 --> 09:19.216
performing arts institution when
they have a known track record

09:19.251 --> 09:21.518
for rejecting really
talented young actors...

09:21.553 --> 09:23.754
(sighs)
you don't need to go to college.

09:23.788 --> 09:25.122
Well, thank you for your input.

09:25.156 --> 09:26.757
I really appreciate
your opinion.

09:26.791 --> 09:28.692
I just...

09:28.727 --> 09:32.129
I have to make
this decision on my own.

09:32.163 --> 09:34.231
Fair enough.

09:34.266 --> 09:36.634
I know that you'll make
the right decision.

09:36.668 --> 09:39.069
I just...

09:41.506 --> 09:44.475
We make really great
music together, Rachel.

09:44.509 --> 09:47.912
We always have.

09:49.247 --> 09:52.349
Think about it.

09:54.119 --> 09:55.719
(school bell rings)

09:55.754 --> 09:57.254
Okay, you're in the back row,
but you're gonna be

09:57.289 --> 09:58.656
the best back-row dancers ever.

09:58.690 --> 09:59.823
Okay? Here we go.

09:59.858 --> 10:02.259
A five, six, seven, eight.

10:02.294 --> 10:04.495
Step together, step together.

10:04.529 --> 10:06.330
Turn. Slide.

10:06.364 --> 10:07.565
Oh, yeah, slide.

10:07.599 --> 10:09.133
WILL and KITTY:
Kick-ball change.

10:09.167 --> 10:10.668
Okay, guys, good,
good, good, good.

10:10.702 --> 10:11.836
Um... we're making progress.

10:11.870 --> 10:13.737
A for effort, all right?

10:13.772 --> 10:15.906
Guys, I'm really sorry.
I'm just, like, not a dancer.

10:15.941 --> 10:17.641
Dude, I'm the one
that's slowing us down.

10:17.676 --> 10:20.110
Okay, anyways,
let's just try it again, okay?

10:20.145 --> 10:22.680
- I'll do it with them. - Okay.
Maybe the music will help.

10:22.714 --> 10:24.081
♪ ♪

10:24.115 --> 10:26.617
Five, six, seven, eight.

10:26.651 --> 10:28.686
Step, step, step, step.

10:28.720 --> 10:30.421
Step together, step together.

10:30.455 --> 10:32.990
Let's just do those turns.

10:33.024 --> 10:35.759
Yes!

10:35.794 --> 10:37.795
(cracks) (groaning)

10:37.829 --> 10:40.698
(sighing, groaning) Aw, gross.

10:40.732 --> 10:42.299
Holy crow!

10:42.334 --> 10:43.634
You did a number on this thing.

10:43.668 --> 10:45.028
Geez, it looks like
somebody rubbed

10:45.036 --> 10:47.004
beets all over your feet.
I love beets.

10:47.038 --> 10:48.506
The X-rays were negative.
It's just a sprain.

10:48.540 --> 10:50.140
But it's one of the
worst I've ever seen.

10:50.141 --> 10:52.810
It's fine, and I'm
not missing sectionals.

10:52.844 --> 10:54.512
The only way you could put
weight on that thing,

10:54.546 --> 10:56.313
let alone dance,
is if you got a cortisone shot.

10:56.348 --> 10:58.449
Okay.
Well, it'll take away the pain,

10:58.483 --> 11:01.218
but it won't fix the damage.
Damage?

11:01.253 --> 11:03.154
I've read this book before, son.

11:03.188 --> 11:04.889
It's a book written
by these knees.

11:04.923 --> 11:06.524
Looks like
a jacked up C-section.

11:06.558 --> 11:08.225
If you perform
on an ankle like that,

11:08.260 --> 11:09.994
there's no telling
how much worse it'll get.

11:10.028 --> 11:12.196
Torn ligaments,
ruptured tendons.

11:12.230 --> 11:15.166
You take an injury that should
take two weeks to heal,

11:15.200 --> 11:18.335
and you turn it into a month,
a year, maybe never.

11:18.370 --> 11:20.204
I-I've heard enough.
This is insane.

11:20.238 --> 11:21.572
Absolutely not.

11:21.606 --> 11:22.973
There's no way
I can let you perform.

11:23.008 --> 11:24.041
No, it's worth it.

11:24.075 --> 11:25.176
No, Spencer, listen to him.

11:25.210 --> 11:27.244
Look, I'm not the best dancer,

11:27.279 --> 11:28.579
I'm not the best singer,

11:28.613 --> 11:30.814
not even close,
but I'm an athlete.

11:30.849 --> 11:33.250
I'm the one that's supposed to
be tougher than everyone else.

11:33.285 --> 11:35.019
On game day, I'm gonna get

11:35.053 --> 11:37.054
that shot and we're gonna win.

11:37.088 --> 11:38.556
And whatever happens after that,

11:38.590 --> 11:39.890
I'll deal with it.

11:45.367 --> 11:46.801
- Hey.
- (Gasps) Oh, my gosh.

11:46.835 --> 11:48.169
What are you doing?
You scared me.

11:48.203 --> 11:49.637
I'm throwing away
all of our old brushes,

11:49.672 --> 11:51.306
and I'm organizing
the foundations.

11:51.340 --> 11:52.974
I found a really good one
to match Spencer's skin tone.

11:53.008 --> 11:55.810
Okay, let me take that and, um,

11:55.844 --> 11:57.078
will you have a seat?

11:57.112 --> 11:58.579
I wanted to talk to you
for a second.

11:58.614 --> 11:59.654
Are you gonna give me

11:59.682 --> 12:00.715
the same speech that Sam did?

12:00.749 --> 12:02.850
Look, Rachel,

12:02.885 --> 12:04.319
I don't want to fight with you.

12:04.353 --> 12:05.720
You know that.

12:05.754 --> 12:07.588
We had the same exact argument
last year.

12:07.623 --> 12:09.324
Broadway or NYADA.

12:09.358 --> 12:11.159
Life is too short.

12:11.193 --> 12:13.895
I truly want you to do
whatever's gonna make you happy,

12:13.929 --> 12:16.998
but I remember you last year,
and you weren't happy.

12:17.032 --> 12:19.000
Last year was hard.
A lot happened.

12:19.034 --> 12:21.569
Yeah, it was hard for all of us.

12:21.603 --> 12:23.771
But a lot of great things
happened to you, too.

12:23.806 --> 12:26.574
You just never got the chance
to enjoy any of them.

12:26.608 --> 12:29.210
I just want you to appreciate
this time in your life.

12:29.244 --> 12:30.945
What if I say no to the show,

12:30.980 --> 12:32.700
and then I never get cast
on Broadway again?

12:32.715 --> 12:34.048
It could be like career suicide.

12:34.083 --> 12:35.683
That's not going
to happen to you.

12:35.718 --> 12:38.786
Listen, you could do
Broadway or NYADA.

12:38.821 --> 12:40.888
You're gonna be great
at whatever you choose.

12:40.923 --> 12:43.191
When I first heard
that you and Blaine

12:43.225 --> 12:45.460
were moving back to Lima
to teach your old glee clubs,

12:45.494 --> 12:47.228
I thought you were crazy,

12:47.262 --> 12:49.764
but I'm so lucky you made
the decision that you did.

12:49.798 --> 12:52.200
You inspired more
than just this group of kids.

12:52.234 --> 12:53.434
You inspired me, too.

12:53.469 --> 12:56.070
What we're doing really matters.

12:56.105 --> 12:58.039
We have a profound effect
on these kids

12:58.073 --> 13:01.042
and their self-esteem and
what they go on to accomplish.

13:01.076 --> 13:02.910
Look, we only have
a few more years left

13:02.945 --> 13:04.279
to go to college and learn

13:04.313 --> 13:05.913
all the fun stuff
like acting and fencing

13:05.948 --> 13:07.148
and choreography.

13:07.182 --> 13:09.751
But we also get to go to school

13:09.785 --> 13:11.052
and be inspired in the process.

13:11.086 --> 13:12.954
I mean, how lucky are we?

13:12.988 --> 13:14.656
I just want you
to think about that

13:14.690 --> 13:16.090
while you're making
this decision.

13:16.125 --> 13:17.659
I'm going back to NYADA,

13:17.693 --> 13:19.427
and-and Blaine is real excited

13:19.461 --> 13:21.763
because he just got into NYU
for next semester.

13:21.797 --> 13:23.798
So we get to start over again.

13:23.832 --> 13:25.800
I mean, how many people
really get the opportunity

13:25.834 --> 13:28.336
to go back to the crossroads
they faced a year ago

13:28.370 --> 13:30.672
and choose the other path?

13:30.706 --> 13:33.941
It could all be different.

13:33.976 --> 13:35.343
(school bell ringing)

13:35.377 --> 13:36.577
Hey, Mr. Shue.

13:36.612 --> 13:38.680
All right.

13:38.714 --> 13:40.248
Look, Mr. Schuester,

13:40.282 --> 13:41.950
the glee club got
a special delivery.

13:41.984 --> 13:43.351
Oh, that's so nice.

13:43.385 --> 13:44.986
The return label says GLAAD.

13:45.020 --> 13:47.422
Maybe they're gifts
for hosting the trans choir.

13:47.456 --> 13:49.616
Wait, wait, wait!
Let's all open them on three.

13:49.625 --> 13:50.792
Oh, yeah.

13:50.826 --> 13:52.627
One,

13:52.661 --> 13:54.028
two,

13:54.063 --> 13:55.463
three!
No!

13:59.501 --> 14:01.369
(screaming)

14:09.812 --> 14:11.446
Quiet, quiet!

14:11.480 --> 14:13.047
(ticking)

14:16.051 --> 14:17.218
Take cover!

14:17.253 --> 14:19.020
(screaming)

14:21.000 --> 14:27.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

14:28.264 --> 14:29.764
It's raining glitter!

14:31.033 --> 14:32.166
Is everyone okay?

14:32.201 --> 14:33.601
Who would do this?

14:35.704 --> 14:38.172
Sue.

14:38.207 --> 14:39.374
Sue.

14:39.408 --> 14:41.009
Sue!

14:43.379 --> 14:44.979
Please tell me that was insured.

14:45.014 --> 14:46.514
Oh, it's not.

14:46.548 --> 14:48.650
But that was very, very pretty.

14:48.684 --> 14:50.151
(sighs)

14:50.185 --> 14:52.086
(Sam groans)

14:52.121 --> 14:55.223
Geez, Sam, are you all right?

14:55.257 --> 14:57.325
Yeah, I think I just
ate some bad meat loaf.

14:57.359 --> 14:58.493
Okay.

14:58.527 --> 15:00.695
(retching) No.

15:00.729 --> 15:02.830
(coughs, sniffles)

15:02.865 --> 15:05.600
I-I'm gonna go get
the school nurse, okay?

15:07.069 --> 15:08.949
Has anyone seen
the school nurse?

15:12.741 --> 15:14.075
(Sue giggling)

15:16.312 --> 15:17.579
Sue, what is going on?

15:17.613 --> 15:19.214
Oh, hello, William.

15:19.248 --> 15:20.949
I was just sniggering
behind this <i> Tupidanthus.</i>

15:20.983 --> 15:22.417
You sent those glitter bombs,
and you...

15:22.451 --> 15:24.052
you put eyedrops
in the coffee, didn't you?

15:24.086 --> 15:25.787
Oh, no, no, no, it's actually

15:25.821 --> 15:28.122
in the entire McKinley High
water system.

15:28.157 --> 15:30.892
Everyone at this school is
experiencing what I like to call.

15:30.926 --> 15:32.627
Monte-Sue-ma's revenge.

15:32.661 --> 15:34.128
What is wrong with you?

15:34.163 --> 15:35.863
Oh, just another flare-up

15:35.898 --> 15:38.800
of my chronic hate disorder,
that's not going to stop

15:38.834 --> 15:40.768
until you quit,
William Schuester.

15:40.803 --> 15:42.470
Oh, my gosh!

15:42.504 --> 15:44.906
Somebody's car's on fire.

15:55.818 --> 15:58.138
(sirens approaching) No.

16:04.627 --> 16:07.629
Oh, Eileen,

16:07.663 --> 16:11.432
preparations are complete,
and my victory is close at hand.

16:11.467 --> 16:13.801
If you'll be so kind,
I'd like to get

16:13.836 --> 16:15.937
my signature Carol Brady blowout

16:15.971 --> 16:19.173
before I lead Vocal Adrenaline
to sectionals.

16:19.208 --> 16:21.009
Coming right up.

16:22.278 --> 16:24.145
(muffled grunting)

16:27.283 --> 16:28.950
(men shouting)

16:28.984 --> 16:31.419
SUE:
Look at the precision.

16:31.453 --> 16:33.521
Not a goose step out of place.

16:33.556 --> 16:35.190
Simply put,

16:35.224 --> 16:38.092
Vocal Adrenaline
is such a machine.

16:38.127 --> 16:39.794
BEISTE: What the hell's
going on in here?

16:42.231 --> 16:43.364
What the hell happened
to your hair?

16:43.399 --> 16:44.532
Hello, Sheldon.

16:44.567 --> 16:45.867
How did you get in here?

16:45.901 --> 16:47.101
You're not even allowed
on the property.

16:47.136 --> 16:48.303
Let's be honest, Sheldon.

16:48.337 --> 16:50.104
If history
has taught us anything,

16:50.139 --> 16:52.607
it's that this school is
remarkably easy to break into.

16:52.641 --> 16:55.009
You know, Sue, it was Will and I

16:55.044 --> 16:56.878
who stood up for you
when nobody else would.

16:56.912 --> 16:58.546
And you pay me back

16:58.581 --> 17:00.048
by breaking into my locker room?

17:00.082 --> 17:02.984
With the show choir
that trashed my car?

17:03.018 --> 17:07.122
So you can show them
old footage of Nazis?

17:07.156 --> 17:09.824
Do you know what those guys
would've done

17:09.858 --> 17:11.726
with a guy like me?

17:11.760 --> 17:13.962
They would've shipped me off.

17:13.996 --> 17:16.498
Or made you the centerpiece
of an awesome zoo.

17:16.531 --> 17:18.633
(laughter)

17:18.666 --> 17:20.568
I want you to get out of here.

17:21.837 --> 17:23.070
Now.

17:23.105 --> 17:24.405
Get out of here, all of you!

17:24.440 --> 17:25.573
Get out!

17:28.176 --> 17:30.545
Well, then, Sheldon, I guess
I will see you at sectionals,

17:30.579 --> 17:33.815
and I think you're going
to be very surprised

17:33.849 --> 17:36.251

30:28.237 --> 30:30.205
(cheering, excited chatter)

30:34.355 --> 30:35.422
(school bell ringing)

30:35.456 --> 30:37.057
Can I just say, I can't believe

30:37.091 --> 30:38.992
I got roped into
doing this thing again...

30:39.027 --> 30:41.995
What has got to be
the lowest form of entertainment

30:42.030 --> 30:43.363
ever known to mankind.

30:43.672 --> 30:45.213
__

30:45.333 --> 30:47.567
So when I got the call
this morning, I'm like,

30:47.602 --> 30:50.404
"Okay, Donna Landries,
just calm down.

30:50.438 --> 30:54.274
These groups cannot be worse
than the last time."

30:54.308 --> 30:56.677
And then they were.

30:56.711 --> 30:58.578
I don't know which group
I hated more.

30:58.613 --> 30:59.813
The Vocal Adrenalines
were like...

30:59.847 --> 31:02.015
that was like
sitting through Fallujah.

31:02.050 --> 31:03.784
You gonna point a cannon at me?

31:03.818 --> 31:05.419
Hell no!

31:05.453 --> 31:07.688
And what's up with
this bird school?

31:07.722 --> 31:09.589
I-Is that a public school?

31:09.624 --> 31:12.759
Is that where
my taxpayer dollars are going?

31:12.794 --> 31:14.961
And don't start me
on New Directions! Oh!

31:14.996 --> 31:17.130
Now, Donna, I'm gonna
stop you right there.

31:17.165 --> 31:19.366
They might not be able
to dance or sing,

31:19.400 --> 31:21.201
but when it comes
to New Directions!

31:21.235 --> 31:23.637
Of the female persuasion, ooh.

31:23.849 --> 31:25.353
__

31:25.473 --> 31:27.140
I mean, how about
that smoking gal

31:27.175 --> 31:29.443
going Au naturel
with the Pam Grier Afro?

31:29.477 --> 31:32.012
Sister's got it going on.

31:32.046 --> 31:34.715
She got me hankering for
a piping hot cup o' cocoa.

31:34.749 --> 31:37.050
What the hell
did you just say to me?

31:37.085 --> 31:39.565
Technically, I'm not even
supposed to be judging.

31:39.685 --> 31:41.269
__

31:41.389 --> 31:43.657
The invitation was
addressed to Trixie,

31:43.691 --> 31:45.125
so really it's up to the dog.

31:45.159 --> 31:47.227
(barks)

31:47.261 --> 31:49.830
Sorry. Trixie's
not racist.

31:49.864 --> 31:52.366
Like all dogs, he sees
in black and white,

31:52.400 --> 31:54.468
and darker skin makes
it harder for him

31:54.502 --> 31:56.982
to make out facial features.

31:57.005 --> 31:58.672
Wait, this dog is a dude?

31:58.706 --> 32:00.307
BUTCH:
He sure is.

32:00.341 --> 32:02.509
And that maleness might
just give us an indication

32:02.543 --> 32:04.177
as to how he's gonna vote.

32:04.212 --> 32:05.646
Now, Trixie...
(clicker clicks)

32:05.680 --> 32:07.314
Trixie, Trixie.

32:07.348 --> 32:11.051
Which glee club displayed
more... "performativity"?

32:11.085 --> 32:12.285
Good boy!

32:12.320 --> 32:14.021
Are you out of your mind?

32:14.055 --> 32:16.423
That was the worst music
I've ever heard.

32:16.457 --> 32:19.726
There's not a single person on
Earth who woke up this morning

32:19.761 --> 32:22.663
and said, "You know what song I
just really need to hear today?"

32:22.697 --> 32:23.764
'Hey, Mickey.'"

32:23.798 --> 32:25.365
And by the time
fatty was singing.

32:25.400 --> 32:27.701
"Take Me to the Church,"
I'm like, "Okay.

32:27.735 --> 32:30.437
Provided the service we attend
is my funeral."

32:30.471 --> 32:33.573
Well, I thought I knew
which show choir had my vote.

32:33.608 --> 32:35.709
But as I scour

32:35.743 --> 32:37.611
the depths of my soul,

32:37.645 --> 32:41.581
I now realize
I have deep reservations

32:41.616 --> 32:44.084
about sending them to regionals.

32:44.118 --> 32:45.585
Well, can we just vote, please?

32:45.620 --> 32:47.554
I got piles.

32:49.490 --> 32:51.358
(school bell ringing)

32:51.392 --> 32:53.060
ANNOUNCER: Before we get
to announcing the winners,

32:53.094 --> 32:54.795
a quick message
from our sponsor:

32:54.829 --> 32:57.764
Wayne's Waffle House is where
to spend your Sundays.

32:57.799 --> 32:59.433
(applause)

33:01.736 --> 33:03.536
(whispering):
I love waffles.

33:04.739 --> 33:06.659
ANNOUNCER:
And now, in third place...

33:11.512 --> 33:13.447
...from the John James
Audubon Institute

33:13.481 --> 33:16.483
for Rehabilitative Ornithology,
the Falconers!

33:20.688 --> 33:23.457
And now, without further ado...

33:23.491 --> 33:27.928
the winner of this year's
sectionals is...

33:41.976 --> 33:43.944
...the New Directions!

33:43.978 --> 33:47.180
(cheering)

33:47.215 --> 33:49.650
♪ ♪

34:15.877 --> 34:17.878
♪ ♪

34:26.460 --> 34:29.496
All right, guys. We're back
at it on Monday morning.

34:29.530 --> 34:30.764
(sighs)

34:30.797 --> 34:32.466
SUE:
Hello, William.

34:36.437 --> 34:39.072
Well, Sue,

34:39.107 --> 34:41.208
looks like it finally happened.

34:41.242 --> 34:42.909
You lost.

34:42.944 --> 34:45.579
Yeah, in a manner
of speaking, yes.

34:45.612 --> 34:47.714
And I have only one thing
to say to you,

34:47.748 --> 34:49.916
and one thing only:
You're welcome.

34:51.219 --> 34:52.585
(chuckles)
I didn't say thank you.

34:52.620 --> 34:54.621
I know, and that's
just plain rude,

34:54.655 --> 34:58.191
because I handed your glee club
a victory on a silver platter,

34:58.226 --> 34:59.693
guaranteeing that
the New Directions!

34:59.727 --> 35:01.895
Will be a part of this school

35:01.929 --> 35:03.397
long after you and I are gone.

35:03.431 --> 35:05.098
Okay, what are you
talking about?

35:05.133 --> 35:07.213
You've spent the last six years
trying to destroy us.

35:07.235 --> 35:09.269
Now you want me to believe
that you suddenly had

35:09.303 --> 35:11.423
a change of heart and you've
been secretly helping us?

35:11.439 --> 35:12.973
Well, that's exactly
what happened,

35:13.007 --> 35:15.309
and I am impressed
that a mind as simple as yours

35:15.343 --> 35:17.110
could make that sophisticated
leap in logic.

35:17.145 --> 35:18.979
What are you talking about?

35:19.013 --> 35:21.915
Well, it is true that I have
spent a better part of a decade

35:21.949 --> 35:23.750
trying to destroy you
and the glee club,

35:23.785 --> 35:26.119
for which I harbor a deep
and abiding hatred,

35:26.154 --> 35:29.556
but when that backstabbing
Geraldo Rivera,

35:29.590 --> 35:32.459
with his craven
ad hominem hack job...

35:32.493 --> 35:35.329
there were only two people
who stood up for me:

35:35.363 --> 35:38.065
Coach Sheldon "The
Abomination" Beiste

35:38.099 --> 35:39.466
and you.

35:39.500 --> 35:41.068
So I took it upon myself

35:41.102 --> 35:42.803
to repay you by sabotaging.

35:42.837 --> 35:45.172
Vocal Adrenaline
from the inside,

35:45.206 --> 35:47.274
handing you a win at sectionals.

35:47.308 --> 35:48.775
Okay, that is insane.

35:48.810 --> 35:50.811
You were absolutely trying
to win today.

35:50.845 --> 35:52.679
You pulled out all the stops.

35:52.714 --> 35:54.181
That was, by far,

35:54.215 --> 35:55.782
the most over-the-top routine.

35:55.817 --> 35:57.517
Vocal Adrenaline has ever done.

35:57.552 --> 35:59.620
Precisely, and it was a routine

35:59.654 --> 36:02.122
specifically tailored
to the deep background

36:02.156 --> 36:04.324
I performed on all three judges.

36:04.359 --> 36:06.259
Now, I knew that an
overly produced,

36:06.294 --> 36:10.330
acrobatic spectacle would remind
Vice Comptroller Donna Landries

36:10.365 --> 36:13.200
of that fateful day
back in October of 1964

36:13.234 --> 36:14.801
in Sandusky, Ohio,

36:14.836 --> 36:16.703
when she attended the circus

36:16.738 --> 36:18.872
and witnessed the most notorious

36:18.906 --> 36:23.043
mass clown stomping in the
history of elephant husbandry.

36:23.077 --> 36:25.278
I included a song from Starship

36:25.313 --> 36:26.847
to subconsciously

36:26.881 --> 36:28.682
unsettle Rod Remington,

36:28.716 --> 36:31.318
who was briefly in
an acrimonious group marriage

36:31.352 --> 36:34.221
with all seven members
of Jefferson Airplane.

36:34.255 --> 36:35.789
But what about the dog trainer?

36:35.823 --> 36:37.958
That chick's rocking an IQ
in the low 80s.

36:37.992 --> 36:39.860
She's an actual idiot.

36:39.894 --> 36:41.628
She was always gonna
love you people.

36:41.663 --> 36:43.563
Well, then why did you
put eyedrops

36:43.598 --> 36:45.032
in the McKinley water system?

36:45.066 --> 36:46.633
I mean, why did you
want the glee club

36:46.668 --> 36:48.168
to spend an entire day

36:48.202 --> 36:50.404
violently projectile-vomiting?
Well, I figured

36:50.438 --> 36:52.506
they all needed to lose
a few pounds, and there's

36:52.540 --> 36:55.475
nothing like a day-long
projectile-vomiting sesh

36:55.510 --> 36:57.411
to jump-start
the old metabolism.

36:57.445 --> 36:59.046
Then why the glitter bombs?

36:59.080 --> 37:02.416
Well, that was to trigger
the stress hormone cortisol.

37:02.450 --> 37:04.718
A good burst of cortisol
boosts alertness

37:04.752 --> 37:07.254
and takes about three days
to fully exit the system,

37:07.288 --> 37:10.490
giving your glee club a
perfectly timed sensation

37:10.525 --> 37:13.393
of relaxed euphoria
the exact moment

37:13.428 --> 37:16.096
they walked onstage.

37:16.130 --> 37:17.831
Wow.

37:17.865 --> 37:19.099
Yeah.

37:19.133 --> 37:20.267
But why did you blow up my car?

37:20.301 --> 37:23.036
Well, that was just for fun.

37:24.739 --> 37:26.273
Well, Susan...

37:26.307 --> 37:28.275
William.

37:28.309 --> 37:29.843
Looks like this is it.

37:29.877 --> 37:31.645
Yeah.

37:38.386 --> 37:40.420
Wow. No thank-you?

37:42.156 --> 37:43.557
No thank-you for the person

37:43.591 --> 37:45.025
who just described
in painstaking detail

37:45.059 --> 37:46.860
how she sacrificed
her own well-being

37:46.894 --> 37:48.795
to save your glee club

37:48.830 --> 37:51.064
and guarantee your job
indefinitely?

37:51.099 --> 37:53.367
Mmm...

37:53.401 --> 37:54.601
Okay.

37:54.636 --> 37:56.770
Change of plans, Butt Chin.

37:56.804 --> 37:58.772
I'm gonna take the weekend,

37:58.806 --> 38:02.109
maybe fly down to my condo
in Boca, brown up a bit,

38:02.143 --> 38:04.945
and when I come back,
I will have come up

38:04.979 --> 38:08.015
with some brand-new ways
to destroy you.

38:10.685 --> 38:12.953
(sighs)

38:25.533 --> 38:28.001
(laughing)

38:28.036 --> 38:30.938
Looks like it was another
cutthroat sectionals.

38:30.972 --> 38:34.007
You know, I forgot the way
it smells in here.

38:34.042 --> 38:37.311
All that life-or-death
teen adrenaline, all that drama.

38:37.345 --> 38:39.580
Feels like a million years ago.

38:39.614 --> 38:41.348
Miss it that much, huh?

38:41.382 --> 38:43.817
(laughs) Oh, God, yes.

38:43.851 --> 38:46.853
Give me a medley or a mash-up
or a Broadway tribute,

38:46.888 --> 38:49.022
anything to get me
back up on that stage

38:49.057 --> 38:52.359
with my friends, singing
and dancing for my life.

38:52.393 --> 38:55.462
God, I loved it so much.

38:55.496 --> 38:57.831
But you know what?

38:59.167 --> 39:01.301
We got bigger fish
to fry now, Berry.

39:01.336 --> 39:03.670
You, me, the footlights
of Broadway.

39:03.705 --> 39:04.838
I don't know

39:04.873 --> 39:06.473
if you've found an apartment yet

39:06.507 --> 39:09.009
to live in,
in New York, but, uh,

39:09.043 --> 39:11.345
you can always stay at mine
until you find one.

39:11.379 --> 39:14.514
No strings attached, of course.

39:14.549 --> 39:16.049
He said flirtatiously.

39:17.318 --> 39:19.219
I turned down the part,

39:19.254 --> 39:20.554
and I decided

39:20.588 --> 39:22.389
to go back to NYADA.

39:22.423 --> 39:24.558
I think I was afraid that going

39:24.592 --> 39:27.528
back to college would be
a step backwards, but...

39:29.531 --> 39:31.565
I think it's a step
in the right direction.

39:31.599 --> 39:33.000
- Hmm.
- So...

39:33.034 --> 39:34.568
don't be mad.

39:34.602 --> 39:36.470
- You're mad.
- No.

39:36.504 --> 39:38.639
I'm not mad.

39:38.673 --> 39:40.908
Sad that I won't be spending

39:40.942 --> 39:43.243
every night onstage
with Rachel Berry, absolutely,

39:43.278 --> 39:44.878
but I'm proud of you.

39:44.913 --> 39:46.480
You went with your gut.

39:46.514 --> 39:49.149
You didn't take the easy
road back to Broadway.

39:49.184 --> 39:50.851
And you know what I think?

39:50.885 --> 39:53.387
NYADA better watch out,
'cause the Berry is back.

39:53.421 --> 39:55.923
(chuckles softly)

39:55.957 --> 39:57.324
(sighs)

39:57.358 --> 39:59.426
Thank you so much
for understanding.

39:59.460 --> 40:01.595
And I will be there on
your opening night,

40:01.629 --> 40:03.363
so you better not screw up,
because I'll have an egg

40:03.398 --> 40:05.365
- in my purse with your name on it.
- Oh, wow.

40:05.400 --> 40:07.234
You're really not gonna let me
live that down, are you?

40:07.268 --> 40:08.602
- No.
- Well, maybe I can make it up

40:08.636 --> 40:10.170
to you, because,
you know, you're gonna

40:10.205 --> 40:12.239
be in New York,
and I'm gonna be in New York,

40:12.273 --> 40:13.707
so we're bound to run
into each other.

40:13.741 --> 40:14.942
I mean, we're bound to, yeah.

40:14.976 --> 40:16.877
I mean, I think it's inevitable.

40:16.911 --> 40:19.613
I'd like that.

40:29.824 --> 40:31.625
All right, I'm gonna go.

40:31.659 --> 40:33.660
I'll see you soon.

40:38.166 --> 40:40.267
(school bell ringing)

40:40.301 --> 40:41.635
(whooping and cheering)

40:41.669 --> 40:43.403
All right, the next
first-place trophy

40:43.438 --> 40:44.905
in that case
is gonna be regionals.

40:44.939 --> 40:47.908
(cheering)

40:47.942 --> 40:49.243
You know, someday... five,

40:49.277 --> 40:50.544
ten, 20 years from now...

40:50.578 --> 40:52.212
You're gonna walk
into this school

40:52.247 --> 40:54.248
and you're gonna see the
trophies in that case or...

40:54.282 --> 40:55.716
or maybe you'll be
watching your own

40:55.750 --> 40:57.384
sons and daughters
win their awards,

40:57.418 --> 41:00.654
and I hope you'll remember
this time in your life,

41:00.688 --> 41:02.556
this incredible
moment when a group

41:02.590 --> 41:05.325
of very different people
put aside their differences,

41:05.360 --> 41:07.928
supported each other
and formed a team,

41:07.962 --> 41:10.731
and hopefully made
some lifelong friendships.

41:10.765 --> 41:12.499
Now, some of our advisors

41:12.534 --> 41:15.135
are gonna be leaving us,

41:15.170 --> 41:17.671
but no matter where we go,
no matter where we are,

41:17.705 --> 41:19.173
we will always be
here in spirit,

41:19.207 --> 41:21.175
and we will always
be supporting you.

41:21.209 --> 41:23.610
Now, a chapter
in Glee Club history

41:23.645 --> 41:27.080
may be ending,
but it is just the beginning

41:27.115 --> 41:29.082
for all of you.

41:29.117 --> 41:30.784
We could not be
more proud of you.

41:30.819 --> 41:32.753
(whooping) Congratulations.

41:32.787 --> 41:35.088
Hey, let's hear it for
Rachel, Mr. Shue, Kurt

41:35.123 --> 41:36.590
and Blaine, everybody.
Oh...

41:36.624 --> 41:39.593
(cheering)

41:39.627 --> 41:42.129
(students murmuring)

41:51.539 --> 41:54.374
You know,
our two little trophies

41:54.409 --> 41:57.644
look really pathetic
in there all by themselves.

41:57.679 --> 42:00.547
I vote we get the old ones

42:00.582 --> 42:02.783
and put them back
in there with them.

42:02.817 --> 42:04.918
(others murmuring in agreement)

42:15.263 --> 42:17.831
(laughter)

42:26.040 --> 42:28.575
(cheering)

42:31.946 --> 42:33.680
WILL:
<i>Congratulations, guys.</i>

42:33.715 --> 42:35.716
(cheering)

42:39.854 --> 42:41.622
(cheering and applause)

42:55.136 --> 42:57.805
(applause)
