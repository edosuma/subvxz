00:10.210 --> 00:13.480
Hey, ladies. I was just taking a nap in my dressing room

00:13.510 --> 00:17.530
When this amazing fantasy dance number came to me in a dream.

00:17.570 --> 00:19.430
It'll be a cool hip-hop dance,

00:19.470 --> 00:23.130
With the dancers coming out of a giant cuckoo clock!

00:23.170 --> 00:24.370
Isn't that a great idea?

00:24.400 --> 00:26.400
Yeah, I love it. I also loved it

00:26.440 --> 00:29.110
When I came up with that idea.

00:29.140 --> 00:30.270
Yeah, well, now it's my idea,

00:30.310 --> 00:32.240
And I love it and we're doing it!

00:32.280 --> 00:34.380
CeCe, who cares whose idea it was?

00:34.410 --> 00:38.220
Especially since Gary's going to make us the leads in that dance.

00:38.250 --> 00:40.250
- I am?  - Yes, you are.

00:40.280 --> 00:43.220
Hmm. Another good idea I came up with.

00:43.250 --> 00:45.490
Now if you'll excuse me, I have to start the show.

00:49.590 --> 00:51.560
Welcome to Shake It Up, Chicago!

00:51.590 --> 00:53.040

00:53.040 --> 00:55.460

00:55.500 --> 00:57.460
Because we are gonna raise the roof

00:57.500 --> 01:00.370
With another one of my dance crew discoveries.

01:00.400 --> 01:04.239
I give you... the ICONic Boyz!

01:04.269 --> 01:07.370
The ICONic Boyz? That was my idea to put them on the show!

01:07.410 --> 01:10.110
Not so much fun when it happens to you, huh?

01:12.000 --> 01:18.074

She move like magic on the floor

01:56.260 --> 01:57.600
I'll be screaming wanting more

01:57.630 --> 01:59.530
She got nothing up her sleeve

01:59.570 --> 02:01.400
I don't know what to believe

02:01.430 --> 02:03.370
She moves like magic on the floor

02:31.500 --> 02:35.400
Everybody, everybody, get out on the floor

02:35.430 --> 02:39.140
It can get a little crazy and the kick hits the floor

02:39.170 --> 02:43.210
Make a scene. Make a scene nobody can ignore

02:43.240 --> 02:47.150
Don't knock it, til you rock it. We can't take it not more!

02:47.180 --> 02:50.480
Bring the lights up! Bust the doors down!

02:50.520 --> 02:54.290
Dust yourself off, Shake it up, shake it up

So, Jessica said the costume for cuckoo clock dance

03:29.220 --> 03:30.350
Are da bomb.

03:31.490 --> 03:33.560
Are you even listening to me?

03:33.590 --> 03:37.160
That girl over there have been staring at us for the past five minutes.

03:37.200 --> 03:41.200
And unless she's blinking exact the same time that I'm blinking

03:41.230 --> 03:42.400
She hasn't blinked yet.

03:44.170 --> 03:45.300
What girl?

03:46.500 --> 03:48.240
Drop your napkin on the floor,

03:48.270 --> 03:51.410
Pretend to pick it up and casually look over your shoulder

03:52.540 --> 03:53.580
Okay.

03:57.580 --> 04:02.420
Oh, look! A random breeze has blow my napkin on the floor.

04:04.290 --> 04:07.090
I will casually pick it up now.

04:14.200 --> 04:15.270
Is it that girl?

04:17.269 --> 04:19.110
Very subtle, CeCe.

04:19.510 --> 04:22.540
Hi, I'm Kat.

04:22.580 --> 04:24.440
Sorry to bother you.

04:24.480 --> 04:27.110
It's just that I'm such a huge fan.

04:27.150 --> 04:31.350
Aw. Thank you.

04:31.390 --> 04:34.490
And I think you're the most awesome dancer on Shake It Up, Chicago!

04:35.490 --> 04:38.420
Aw. Thank you.

04:40.130 --> 04:42.330
Listen to me, gushing on and on.

04:42.360 --> 04:45.230
Nerd City, population, me.

04:46.530 --> 04:48.330
Sorry for interrupting your lunch.

04:56.280 --> 04:59.280
So, uh... Would you like to join us?

04:59.320 --> 05:02.380
Oh, my gosh. No, no, no. Really.

05:02.420 --> 05:04.250
I mean, I couldn't. Really.

05:04.290 --> 05:07.460
What if someone saw a loser like me sitting with you?

05:07.490 --> 05:08.470
It could ruin your career

05:08.470 --> 05:10.190
And then I'd never see you on the show again

05:10.230 --> 05:11.460
And then I'd die. I'd just die!

05:13.100 --> 05:15.260
Although, a few minutes wouldn't kill anyone.

05:17.270 --> 05:21.170
So, what kind of pizza do you like?

05:21.200 --> 05:23.400
I like whatever you like, CeCe.

05:23.440 --> 05:25.410
You have the most amazing taste.

05:25.440 --> 05:28.080
I mean, I love your clothes, your hair...

05:28.110 --> 05:31.410
And you're even prettier in real life than you are on TV!

05:33.150 --> 05:35.180
You know what? I like this girl.

05:40.190 --> 05:42.320
Next time, Flynn, you're gonna come to our place.

05:42.360 --> 05:45.220
We have our own bowling alley and an indoor pool.

05:45.260 --> 05:49.260
I had no idea, Mr. Gold.

05:49.300 --> 05:52.230
I'm so glad you're my new best friend, Mike.

05:52.270 --> 05:54.100
And we're right on the lake, so you play your cards right,

05:54.130 --> 05:55.330
I'll let you drive the speedboat.

05:55.370 --> 05:57.270
Am I old enough for that?

05:57.300 --> 05:58.950
Flynn, I'm incredibly rich.

05:58.950 --> 06:01.270
There are no rules for people like me.

06:01.310 --> 06:03.410
Come on, Son, the helicopter's on the roof.

06:08.150 --> 06:11.480
That was Dave Gold! The biggest music producer in Chicago!

06:11.520 --> 06:13.390
And that was his son, Mike Gold,

06:13.420 --> 06:15.290
The biggest booger producer in the fourth grade.

06:16.490 --> 06:18.320
You have to hook me up with his dad

06:18.360 --> 06:19.530
And get him to listen to my music.

06:19.560 --> 06:21.360
You know, I would, but not a fan.

06:23.130 --> 06:25.400
Come on, Flynn. This could be my big shot.

06:25.430 --> 06:27.470
What's in it for me?

06:27.500 --> 06:28.680
The knowledge that you

06:28.680 --> 06:31.200
helped your friend achieve his life-long dream.

06:31.240 --> 06:32.510
What else you got?

06:32.540 --> 06:34.170
I'll cut you in for 10%.

06:34.210 --> 06:36.480
Excited to be working with you. Big fan.

06:39.580 --> 06:41.480
One and two, and three and four...

06:42.580 --> 06:44.550
Okay. I'm coming.

06:48.560 --> 06:50.420
Hi, CeCe! Hi, Rocky!

06:51.390 --> 06:52.490
Kat!

06:53.360 --> 06:56.130
Okay, come on in.

06:57.400 --> 06:58.530
Let me guess.

06:58.570 --> 07:00.430
Did my autograph wash off your hand already?

07:01.240 --> 07:03.500
No, all good.

07:03.540 --> 07:05.510
But you forgot your lip gloss at Crusty's

07:05.540 --> 07:08.110
And I wanted to bring it to you.

07:08.140 --> 07:10.510
Oh, thank you, Kat. It's my favorite.

07:10.550 --> 07:13.350
Oh! Looks like it's your favorite, too.

07:13.380 --> 07:16.080
Oh, I am so mortified.

07:16.120 --> 07:18.050
It looked so pretty on you, CeCe.

07:18.090 --> 07:20.160
I just wanted to try it on for a second.

07:20.190 --> 07:24.160
What was I thinking? My lips are not good enough for your gloss.

07:30.370 --> 07:32.100
You can keep it, Kat.

07:32.140 --> 07:33.340
There.

07:33.370 --> 07:36.140
She's gonna need it after kissing your butt all day.

07:37.140 --> 07:38.340
Thank you, CeCe.

07:38.380 --> 07:41.140
You're just as generous as your fan site says you are.

07:41.180 --> 07:43.250
Oh, I don't have a fan site.

07:43.280 --> 07:46.480
Now you do. You're welcome.

07:46.520 --> 07:49.550
Okay. Well, we have to get back to rehearsing now.

07:49.590 --> 07:53.320
Oh, my gosh. I'm so sorry to interrupt.

07:54.130 --> 07:55.230
Good-bye.

08:03.300 --> 08:04.300
Good-bye.

08:05.270 --> 08:09.070
Oh, right. Take care.

08:15.310 --> 08:16.410
See you.

08:17.510 --> 08:19.150
You, too.

08:24.220 --> 08:28.290
Mmm, would you like to stay and watch us rehearse?

08:28.320 --> 08:32.130
I'd love to. And to think I nearly left.

08:32.530 --> 08:34.530
Yeah... Nearly.

08:37.429 --> 08:40.299
Okay. So, five, six, seven, eight.

08:40.340 --> 08:44.310
One and two, three and a four, and a five, six, seven, eight.

08:44.340 --> 08:47.110
Oh, you guys are so good.

08:47.140 --> 08:50.150
If only I could be a part of Shake It Up, Chicag somehow.

08:50.180 --> 08:53.510
But what would someone who can't dance do on a dance show?

08:54.580 --> 08:57.220
Well, sometimes the show hires interns,

08:57.250 --> 08:58.350
Which is a good way to learn about the business.

08:58.390 --> 08:59.550
I mean, you don't have to dance...

08:59.590 --> 09:01.450
Great! So you'll talk to Gary about that?

09:01.490 --> 09:05.190
I'll start Monday. Anytime after three. You guys are the best.

09:13.370 --> 09:16.310
Here you go, Mr. Wilde. Fresh baked.

09:16.340 --> 09:18.470
Kat, you're the best intern ever.

09:18.510 --> 09:20.040
How did you know that pumpkin

09:20.040 --> 09:22.150
chocolate chip muffins were my favorite?

09:22.180 --> 09:23.510
I researched you online.

09:23.550 --> 09:27.380
"Gary Wilde loves croquet, macrame, and argyle sweaters."

09:27.420 --> 09:30.090
Speaking of which...

09:30.120 --> 09:31.320
I knitted it myself.

09:32.220 --> 09:34.120
It matches my eyes!

09:34.160 --> 09:35.360
No coincidence, Gary.

09:38.100 --> 09:40.260
You look hot, CeCe. Allow me.

09:40.300 --> 09:42.470
Wow! That feels really nice. Ow, ow!

09:42.500 --> 09:44.140
What's wrong, CeCe?

09:44.170 --> 09:46.200
My foot! You're crushing my foot!

09:46.240 --> 09:48.470
I'm so sorry, CeCe.

09:48.510 --> 09:51.440
Still on my foot!

09:53.280 --> 09:56.350
Oh, my godfather! I'm such a clod!

09:56.380 --> 09:58.250
I'm so sorry I crushed your toe.

09:58.280 --> 10:00.490
Don't worry about it. It was an accident.

10:00.520 --> 10:02.550
All right. Take five, everyone.

10:02.590 --> 10:04.420
This is all my fault.

10:04.460 --> 10:05.620
Now everyone's losing

10:05.630 --> 10:08.130
precious rehearsal time because of clumsy me.

10:09.330 --> 10:11.300
Unless...

10:11.330 --> 10:13.100
I fill in for you, CeCe.

10:13.130 --> 10:16.200
I mean, I'm horrible but at least everyone can keep rehearsing.

10:16.240 --> 10:18.200
Great idea, Kat! Let's do that.

10:19.170 --> 10:20.310
Thanks, Kat.

10:20.340 --> 10:24.510
Okay, from the top, people! Five, six, seven, eight...

10:28.380 --> 10:31.350
Um, you know, for someone who claimed that they couldn't dance,

10:31.380 --> 10:33.620
you seem to be a huge liar.

10:40.560 --> 10:42.490
You know, Ty, I get handed a lot of demos,

10:42.530 --> 10:44.530
But your music really impressed me.

10:44.560 --> 10:48.270
Are you serious, Mr. Gold? Oh, this is amazing.

10:48.300 --> 10:50.440
Uh-uh-uh. Not so fast.

10:50.470 --> 10:54.340
See, Ty tends to get a little overly excited.

10:54.370 --> 10:55.370
But you should know that

10:55.370 --> 10:57.310
We're currently fielding a lot of other offers.

10:58.440 --> 10:59.480
What are you doing?

10:59.510 --> 11:00.510
I'm sweetening the pot.

11:00.550 --> 11:03.250
My pot's fine!

11:03.280 --> 11:06.220
It's the kid's first time at the rodeo.

11:06.250 --> 11:08.320
Now let's get down to brass tacks, Dave.

11:08.350 --> 11:11.290
What exactly are you offering Ty?

11:11.320 --> 11:13.360
An opportunity to cut a demo

11:13.390 --> 11:16.160
at a world-class recording studio with a top music producer.

11:16.600 --> 11:18.500
And what does that pay?

11:18.530 --> 11:21.130
Let's see, all together,

11:21.170 --> 11:22.230
That would be nothing.

11:24.340 --> 11:27.310
Okay, that's a good starting point.

11:27.340 --> 11:30.280
But I'm going to counter with five million dollars.

11:32.180 --> 11:34.150
Your move.

11:34.180 --> 11:37.480
Still paying nothing, but I will throw in lunch.

11:37.520 --> 11:39.520
You drive a hard bargain, Dave.

11:42.190 --> 11:43.560
You hear that, Ty? I got you lunch.

11:48.230 --> 11:50.130
What is up with that Kat?

11:50.160 --> 11:51.330
I mean, one second, she's like,

11:51.370 --> 11:54.270
"Oh, I don't know how to dance..."

11:54.300 --> 11:56.200
And then the next second, she's all...

11:56.240 --> 11:59.140
"Five, six, seven, let's go."

11:59.170 --> 12:02.440
I'm telling you, there is something not right about that girl.

12:02.480 --> 12:07.110
Yeah, but she's so sweet, and I love the way she dresses.

12:07.150 --> 12:10.320
That's because she's now dressing exactly like you.

12:10.350 --> 12:12.350
And dancing exactly like you.

12:12.390 --> 12:15.320
Seriously, she's studying you like there's going to be a test.

12:16.160 --> 12:17.360
I wish.

12:17.390 --> 12:19.290
It'd be the one test I could definitely get a B on.

12:21.430 --> 12:24.570
Would you relax, Rocky? She's just a big fan.

12:24.600 --> 12:28.100
I mean, it's kind of like how we love Beyonce.

12:28.140 --> 12:30.310
Her dance moves, the way she dresses.

12:30.340 --> 12:32.470
Kat is to us as we are to Beyonce.

12:33.480 --> 12:37.550
Hey, not a bad math equation, huh?

12:37.580 --> 12:40.550
Not bad at all. Except that's not math. It's English.

12:40.580 --> 12:43.320
And that's not an equation, that's an analogy.

12:44.420 --> 12:45.620
So I didn't get anything right?

12:47.160 --> 12:48.390
Well, we do like Beyonce.

12:51.400 --> 12:53.400
Hey, CeCe, I forgot to ask if...

12:56.270 --> 12:57.430
Kat?

12:57.470 --> 13:00.140
Oh, hey, Rocky. What's new?

13:00.170 --> 13:02.240
Your hair.

13:02.270 --> 13:04.410
Oh, sorry, I thought you said, "What's creepy?"

13:06.410 --> 13:09.510
Later, Rocky. Hi, Kat. You look really cute today.

13:09.550 --> 13:11.450
Did you do something different to your hair?

13:13.150 --> 13:14.220
Hey!

13:21.320 --> 13:23.130
Rocky, I'm freaking out!

13:23.160 --> 13:26.200
I mean, she stole my hair, she stole my look...

13:26.230 --> 13:27.500
Kat! She is a big...

13:27.530 --> 13:29.470
Nutty-nutty-nutball, whackadoo of the week?

13:31.330 --> 13:35.470
I was going to say copycat, but I like yours better.

13:35.500 --> 13:38.270
Hey, look, there's no way that we're gonna let her get away

13:38.310 --> 13:40.370
With whatever she's trying to get away with.

13:40.410 --> 13:43.240
By the way, what the heck is she trying to get away with?

13:43.280 --> 13:46.380
Guys, come on! It's not that difficult.

13:46.420 --> 13:48.380
Scoop kick, swivel foot, cool jerk.

13:48.420 --> 13:49.490
Get it together!

13:52.520 --> 13:56.330
Um, Kat, what are you doing on the stage again?

13:56.360 --> 13:57.460
Didn't you hear? After you wrote that

13:57.490 --> 13:59.330
Awesome recommendation letter to Gary,

13:59.360 --> 14:02.260
He made me a backup dancer on the show.

14:02.300 --> 14:04.570
We didn't write any recommendation letter.

14:04.600 --> 14:07.440
Well, you guys are so busy I didn't want to bother you,

14:07.470 --> 14:10.340
So I did it for you. You're welcome.

14:11.540 --> 14:13.340
What is your problem?

14:13.380 --> 14:15.210
Did I do something wrong?

14:15.250 --> 14:17.080
Because I'd feel really bad if my friends...

14:17.110 --> 14:20.350
Oh! Sell it somewhere else, sister, because we ain't buying it.

14:22.320 --> 14:24.320
Yeah. Cancel our subscription,

14:24.350 --> 14:27.060
Because we are over your issues.

14:27.090 --> 14:28.390
- Oh, that was a good one. - I know, right?

14:28.420 --> 14:30.260
I'm just starting.

14:32.160 --> 14:34.400
You pretended to be all shy and clueless

14:34.430 --> 14:36.230
But your real plan was just to get on

14:36.270 --> 14:39.070
Shake It Up, Chicago! All along.

14:39.100 --> 14:42.100
Well, I guess you're not as stupid as everyone thinks you are.

14:42.510 --> 14:44.310
Thank you. Hey!

14:46.110 --> 14:49.280
Okay, look! This is not about how stupid CeCe is!

14:49.310 --> 14:51.110
Thank you. Hey!

14:53.150 --> 14:55.220
Look, there's room for all of us here.

14:55.250 --> 14:57.450
I'm perfectly happy being a background dancer,

14:57.490 --> 14:59.460
And you two have your big cuckoo clock dance.

14:59.490 --> 15:03.390
So, stay out of my way and I'll stay out of yours.

15:05.330 --> 15:08.500
From the top, people! And this time, try and keep up with me!

15:08.530 --> 15:11.070
Five, six, seven, eight!

15:16.310 --> 15:18.410
I've got a really good feeling about this, Ty.

15:18.440 --> 15:21.210
I think you're exactly the sound we've been looking for.

15:21.240 --> 15:22.580
Oh, thanks, man.

15:22.610 --> 15:25.310
I brought a few songs I've written to choose from for the demo.

15:25.350 --> 15:28.150
Needless to say, we'll be retaining full rights and ownership

15:28.180 --> 15:30.550
of said songs, heretofore and in perpetuity.

15:32.260 --> 15:33.460
Do you even know what that means?

15:33.490 --> 15:35.460
Because I don't even know what that means.

15:35.490 --> 15:38.230
But, kid, my next negotiation, I'm totally using it.

15:39.300 --> 15:41.130
Anyway, it doesn't matter

15:41.170 --> 15:42.470
Because we've already had a song written for you to sing.

15:42.500 --> 15:45.230
What? You had a song written just for me?

15:45.270 --> 15:47.170
Aw, man! That's so cool!

15:49.410 --> 15:52.170
Uh... "Lace It Up"?

15:52.210 --> 15:54.540
Who wants to hear a rap about tying your shoe?

15:54.580 --> 15:57.280
Four to nine-year-olds. That's the market we're going after.

15:57.310 --> 15:58.410
This is kid rap.

15:58.450 --> 16:00.180
Come on, give it a try.

16:04.150 --> 16:06.160
Okay. Yeah!

16:06.190 --> 16:07.320
Here we go!

16:07.360 --> 16:09.390
Check it out kids all up in the place

16:09.430 --> 16:13.200
I'm gonna show you how to handle a shoe with a lace

16:16.130 --> 16:18.030
Okay.

16:18.070 --> 16:20.170
Grab two strings and you pull 'em apart

16:20.200 --> 16:22.400
Then you cross and pull this is how you start

16:22.440 --> 16:24.440
You make two loops

16:24.470 --> 16:27.340
Okay, I can't do this.

16:27.380 --> 16:29.280
You want to handle this or should I?

16:29.310 --> 16:30.380
I got it.

16:35.080 --> 16:36.220
You wanna talk about this?

16:38.250 --> 16:40.680
Look, this is just not what I expected.

16:40.680 --> 16:42.290
This song is totally lame.

16:42.330 --> 16:44.530
Yeah, I hear ya. Here's how I see it.

16:44.560 --> 16:46.020
You can have a career rapping

16:46.020 --> 16:48.130
to kids about tying their shoes and stuff,

16:48.160 --> 16:50.360
Or you can go back to rapping to your pillow.

16:51.100 --> 16:52.270
Your call.

16:54.500 --> 16:55.540
Pillow.

16:58.540 --> 17:00.240
Sorry, Mr. Gold.

17:03.180 --> 17:05.280
Don't worry, Dave. Fortunately, I have another rapper

17:05.310 --> 17:06.200
Who would love to be

17:06.210 --> 17:08.210
popular with the four to nine-year-old crowd.

17:08.250 --> 17:11.420
In fact, he is nine. And he's much better looking than Ty.

17:11.450 --> 17:12.490
Really, who's that?

17:19.089 --> 17:20.329
Hey, CeCe, could you get this for me?

17:22.359 --> 17:25.130
Thanks. This dance is gonna totally kick butt.

17:25.170 --> 17:27.400
Speaking of which... Ow!

17:27.440 --> 17:30.440
You're cutting off the circulation to my butt.

17:30.470 --> 17:33.210
You're pulling it too tight, CeCe.

17:34.110 --> 17:35.280
Oh, sorry.

17:36.150 --> 17:38.450
Hey, you're not CeCe.

17:38.480 --> 17:41.380
What gave it away? The fact that I'm a much better dancer

17:41.420 --> 17:43.120
or I know all 50 states?

17:44.220 --> 17:45.520
CeCe knows all...

17:45.560 --> 17:49.160
CeCe knows almost all...

17:49.190 --> 17:50.490
CeCe's a much better dancer than you!

17:52.300 --> 17:54.200
Where is she?

17:54.230 --> 17:56.200
You should know, since you're the one who emailed her

17:56.230 --> 17:59.100
to go pick up her new costume all the way across town.

17:59.140 --> 18:01.340
Good thing I know all the steps and can go on for her.

18:03.170 --> 18:05.470
You really think that you can just get rid of CeCe that easy?

18:05.510 --> 18:08.380
Well, trust me, CeCe's like a bad mustard stain

18:08.410 --> 18:12.180
on your favorite T-shirt. Not going anywhere.

18:12.220 --> 18:15.220
Now, there is no way that CeCe's going to miss this dance.

18:15.250 --> 18:16.700
And now, get ready to go

18:16.700 --> 18:19.050
cuckoo with the Spotlight Dance of the Week!

18:19.090 --> 18:20.460
Cuckoo! Time's up.

18:20.490 --> 18:23.290
Oh, and you better not mess up my big number.

18:23.330 --> 18:24.330
Hmm.

18:56.160 --> 18:58.290
Rocky! I made it! I'm here! I'm here!

18:58.330 --> 19:00.500
Rocky, the cuckoo clock dance has started.

19:00.530 --> 19:02.430
Why aren't you dressed as a giant order of nachos?

19:02.470 --> 19:03.500
Wait a minute, don't answer that.

19:03.530 --> 19:06.300
Kat's doing my dance, isn't she?

19:06.340 --> 19:09.370
Yep. This was all part of her big setup to take your place.

19:09.410 --> 19:12.170
But don't worry, we'll figure out what to do together.

19:12.210 --> 19:14.110
No matter what, I will stand by your side.

19:14.140 --> 19:16.150
I am not going anywhere.

19:17.310 --> 19:18.310
Okay.

19:23.520 --> 19:28.020
Can I get a large soft drink and one of you with no butter?

19:28.060 --> 19:28.960
You didn't really think you

19:28.960 --> 19:30.360
were going to get away with this, did you?

19:30.390 --> 19:32.260
Actually, I think I already have.

19:32.290 --> 19:34.130
Well, think again!

20:17.340 --> 20:21.340
Okay, Kat, that's it. I want you out of here now!

20:21.380 --> 20:23.440
Get off this stage and never come back.

20:23.480 --> 20:25.380
Okay.

20:25.410 --> 20:28.250
Wow, that went a lot better than I thought it would.

20:28.280 --> 20:30.080
Today was my last day anyway.

20:30.120 --> 20:32.520
I'm leaving to join the cast of Shake It Up, New York!

20:33.590 --> 20:36.290
Shake It Up, New what now?

20:36.320 --> 20:38.460
Apparently, Gary sent a glowing email about me,

20:38.490 --> 20:40.230
And they just snapped me up.

20:40.260 --> 20:42.260
Yeah, well, I'd like to snap you in half.

20:43.530 --> 20:47.300
Oh, Rocky, don't be like that.

20:47.340 --> 20:48.570
Good luck, Kat. We'll miss you.

20:51.370 --> 20:54.240
Yeah, like you'd miss having a zit on your rear end.

20:56.280 --> 20:57.370
No, I cannot believe that

20:57.370 --> 20:59.250
She's going to be on Shake It Up, New York!

20:59.280 --> 21:01.120
Well, then you shouldn't believe it.

21:01.150 --> 21:04.420
Because someone used Shake It Up, New York!'s account

21:04.460 --> 21:06.420
And sent her a fake email.

21:06.460 --> 21:08.490
Imagine the look on her face when she gets there

21:08.530 --> 21:11.490
And they have no idea who she is.

21:11.530 --> 21:15.060
Yeah, well, whoever did that is a genius.

21:15.100 --> 21:18.400
Hey, I may not know all 49 states,

21:20.140 --> 21:21.440
But I know one thing.

21:21.470 --> 21:23.500
There's only room for one nutty-nutty-nutball on this stage,

21:23.540 --> 21:25.440
And it's me.

21:27.140 --> 21:31.310
Hi, Rocky. Hi, CeCe. I'm your biggest fan!

21:31.350 --> 21:36.120
I know I'm not worthy, but could I carry your dance bags for you?

21:37.250 --> 21:39.490
Aw. No, thanks!

21:43.070 --> 21:45.350
There once was a boy who lived in a shoe

21:45.450 --> 21:48.100
He had so many laces that he didn't know what to do

21:48.240 --> 21:50.900
But over, under around and through

21:51.000 --> 21:53.850
That's how MC Flynn ties his shoes

21:54.090 --> 21:56.500
Don't get it yet, please don't frown

21:56.500 --> 21:59.700
'Cause now it's time for me to break it down, come on

21:59.780 --> 22:02.290
Over, under around and through

22:02.420 --> 22:05.250
That's how MC Flynn ties his shoes. Word!

22:08.520 --> 22:11.720
I didn't know they are going to do a whole music video for this.

22:13.350 --> 22:15.990
Or that will go number 1 on the kid's shots.

22:16.650 --> 22:18.270
Or go viral on the Internet.

22:19.530 --> 22:22.310
Ten million people don't know how to tie their stupid shoes?

22:23.610 --> 22:27.950
A, the important thing, is that your pillow nose didn't sell out.

22:29.870 --> 22:31.930
Oh, careful. Your shoe lace is untide.

22:31.990 --> 22:35.680
Remember, you go over under, round and through.
