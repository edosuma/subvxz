02:43.104 --> 02:44.605
How did you get him
so quickly?

02:44.605 --> 02:46.607
A medical team heard
the shell coming in.

02:46.607 --> 02:48.108
Apparently, he did, too.

02:48.609 --> 02:51.011
Chest and belly
practically unmarked.

02:51.012 --> 02:53.381
Curious how they always
double up in the fetal position.

02:53.381 --> 02:54.849
What's curious about it?

02:54.849 --> 02:56.684
They're trying to
protect their genitals.

02:56.684 --> 02:59.553
Well, this young man
unfortunately succeeded.

02:59.554 --> 03:01.422
Any identification?

03:01.422 --> 03:02.456
No, sir.

03:02.457 --> 03:03.758
Then we'll assume he's ours.

03:04.292 --> 03:06.694
I'll need to take personal
charge of this case

03:06.694 --> 03:08.162
until repairs are completed.

03:08.629 --> 03:10.130
That could be
rather a long time,

03:10.131 --> 03:11.632
Colonel Tillery.

03:11.632 --> 03:13.100
Wouldn't you say, Captain,

03:13.101 --> 03:15.036
that it's worth a year
of any doctor's life

03:15.036 --> 03:16.837
to observe
a case like this?

03:16.838 --> 03:19.782
You'd never know what
has happened to him.

03:19.782 --> 03:22.284
The one part of his brain
that has escaped damage

03:22.285 --> 03:24.287
is the medulla oblongata.

03:24.287 --> 03:26.289
It is only because of this

03:26.289 --> 03:28.291
that his heart, vasal, motor,

03:28.291 --> 03:30.793
and respiratory centers
still function.

03:30.793 --> 03:33.796
In short, that he lives.

04:36.859 --> 04:39.862
Unidentified casualty
number 4-7.

04:39.862 --> 04:41.864
Post-operation orders,

04:41.864 --> 04:42.865
Colonel M.F. Tillery,

04:42.865 --> 04:45.367
U.S. Army Medical Corps.

04:45.368 --> 04:47.870
Although the cerebellum
still permits

04:47.870 --> 04:49.371
limited physical movement,

04:49.372 --> 04:51.874
said movement
signifies nothing.

04:51.874 --> 04:54.376
Bodily actions
have become violent,

04:54.877 --> 04:55.878
and are persistently
repetitive

04:56.379 --> 04:59.382
and must be treated as
reflexive muscular spasms--

04:59.382 --> 05:01.884
which is to say, by sedation.

05:04.754 --> 05:08.758
The cerebrum has suffered
massive and irreparable damage.

05:08.758 --> 05:10.259
Had I not been sure of this,

05:10.259 --> 05:13.262
I would not have
permitted him to live.

05:16.766 --> 05:20.778
There's no justification
for his continued existence

05:20.778 --> 05:23.747
unless we learn from him
how to help others.

05:23.748 --> 05:25.750
Care for him as gently

05:26.250 --> 05:27.751
as if he knew
what you were doing

05:27.752 --> 05:30.755
and would feel the pain
if you did it badly.

05:30.755 --> 05:33.257
Attending personnel
will remember that

05:33.257 --> 05:34.691
good medical care forbids

05:34.692 --> 05:37.461
emotional involvement
with the patient.

05:37.461 --> 05:40.363
Avoid such involvement
by remembering

05:40.364 --> 05:43.375
that it is impossible for
a decerebrated individual

05:43.375 --> 05:46.878
to experience pain,
pleasure, memory,

05:46.879 --> 05:50.323
dreams, or thought
of any kind.

05:50.323 --> 05:53.326
It follows, therefore,
that this young man

05:53.326 --> 05:56.829
will be as unfeeling,
as unthinking as the dead

05:56.830 --> 05:59.332
until the day he joins them.

06:19.085 --> 06:21.087
Kareen?

06:27.594 --> 06:29.095
Kareen?

06:33.099 --> 06:35.601
What happened?

06:37.612 --> 06:39.614
Where am I?

06:45.620 --> 06:48.122
It's dark in here.

06:50.125 --> 06:51.126
Shouldn't have
turned the lights out.

06:51.126 --> 06:53.136
Your old man
will be sore.

06:53.136 --> 06:54.971
Oh, Mike won't care.
He loves me.

06:54.971 --> 06:58.574
Only could I just
ask you one thing?

06:59.075 --> 07:01.052
Why'd you have to volunteer?

07:01.052 --> 07:03.454
Only six months
from the draft anyhow.

07:03.455 --> 07:05.965
Pinkie and Larry
have already gone.

07:05.965 --> 07:08.467
You could have been exempt
because of your sisters.

07:08.468 --> 07:09.969
My mother's got a job.

07:09.969 --> 07:11.347
Besides, when the country
needs you, you've gotta go.

07:11.348 --> 07:13.259
You should go.

07:13.259 --> 07:15.794
I don't think
anybody should go.

07:15.795 --> 07:17.696
They'll kill you.

07:17.697 --> 07:19.699
Oh, I could get killed
at the bakery, too,

07:19.699 --> 07:21.701
or crossing the street.

07:21.701 --> 07:24.704
I can take care of myself.
Don't worry.

07:24.704 --> 07:27.640
Lots of people get killed
who don't think they'll be.

07:27.640 --> 07:29.541
Lots of people come
back, too. Most of 'em.

07:29.542 --> 07:33.279
Most of them, Joe,
they never come back.

07:33.279 --> 07:35.114
Oh, if anything ever
happened to you,

07:35.114 --> 07:36.523
I'd just die.

07:36.524 --> 07:39.326
Ah, you're only
saying that.

07:40.327 --> 07:42.262
I love you.

07:42.263 --> 07:44.231
I do love you.

07:55.451 --> 07:56.952
Stop it.

07:58.954 --> 08:00.938
I won't have this
in my house.

08:00.939 --> 08:02.807
You think you're sitting in
the back seat of a flivver?

08:02.807 --> 08:05.051
Now get up. Both of you,
get up like decent people.

08:05.052 --> 08:06.528
Come on, get up.

08:06.529 --> 08:08.030
But he's going away
in the morning.

08:08.531 --> 08:10.533
I know, I know.
Get in the bedroom.

08:11.534 --> 08:13.035
Both of you.

08:19.875 --> 08:21.376
I ain't much.

08:21.877 --> 08:23.378
25 years
in the coal mines,

08:23.379 --> 08:24.880
carryin' an IWW card.

08:24.880 --> 08:26.214
Now, what am I?

08:26.215 --> 08:28.183
Goddamn railroad
bull, that's what.

08:28.183 --> 08:30.118
Oh, anyhow.

08:30.119 --> 08:32.087
Go on in there
with her. She's scared.

08:32.087 --> 08:33.996
Go-- Go on in.

08:33.996 --> 08:35.798
Yes, sir.
Put your arms around her.

08:35.799 --> 08:37.808
You know how to
treat her, don't you? Yes, sir.

08:37.808 --> 08:39.243
Uh--

08:39.244 --> 08:41.212
She isn't a whore.
You know that, don't ya?

08:41.212 --> 08:42.714
Yes, sir.

08:42.714 --> 08:45.149
Eh, go to bed, son.

08:45.150 --> 08:46.684
Yes, sir.

08:53.592 --> 08:55.560
Son.

09:01.466 --> 09:03.342
I see you.

09:04.853 --> 09:06.354
Nice room.

09:10.191 --> 09:13.127
Mike fixed it up
for my graduation.

09:15.630 --> 09:17.965
Picture's crooked, though.

09:23.772 --> 09:25.640
It was my mother's.

09:31.579 --> 09:33.547
Why don't you
take your shoes off?

09:33.548 --> 09:34.982
Okay.

10:20.729 --> 10:21.730
Joe.

10:22.163 --> 10:23.164
Yeah?

10:23.164 --> 10:24.665
Could you turn your back?

10:24.666 --> 10:26.167
Why?

10:26.167 --> 10:27.568
I have to get out of bed.

10:27.569 --> 10:30.355
No. I want to see you.

10:30.355 --> 10:31.856
I won't let you see me.

10:31.856 --> 10:33.757
Would you get me my robe?

10:33.758 --> 10:34.592
Sure.

10:34.960 --> 10:36.528
It's on the closet
door. It's red.

10:37.862 --> 10:39.697
Okay.

10:46.546 --> 10:48.548
Why'd you do that?

10:48.548 --> 10:50.483
Hot night.

10:50.483 --> 10:51.395
Here it is.

10:51.863 --> 10:55.700
Bring it
closer, silly. Uh-uh. Reach for it.

10:55.700 --> 10:57.702
All right, here.
I'll help you.

11:04.676 --> 11:06.678
Oops.

11:10.015 --> 11:11.983
Let's get it
through here.

11:11.983 --> 11:14.919
There. There you go.

11:16.922 --> 11:19.357
I'll get it right.

11:19.357 --> 11:20.358
Here, let me show you.

11:20.358 --> 11:23.361
Now we got it. There.

11:25.363 --> 11:27.798
Huh?
No.

11:54.359 --> 11:57.295
We should have flowers.
Hm? Sure.

12:04.436 --> 12:06.905
If you really
want to see me--

12:06.905 --> 12:08.406
Oh, if you don't
want me to,

12:08.406 --> 12:09.907
I don't want to, either.

12:53.084 --> 12:55.586
Well, fair is fair.

13:02.027 --> 13:04.429
Okay.

14:31.983 --> 14:33.484
It's nice like this,
isn't it?

14:33.485 --> 14:36.321
Mm-hmm.

14:36.321 --> 14:38.823
Have you ever been this
way with anyone else?

14:38.823 --> 14:40.825
Not with anyone I loved.

14:41.301 --> 14:42.802
I'm glad.

14:43.303 --> 14:44.812
Have you?

14:44.813 --> 14:46.314
You shouldn't
ask that.

14:46.314 --> 14:47.790
Why not?

14:48.291 --> 14:49.258
Because I'm a lady.

14:49.259 --> 14:52.078
You're a mick.

14:52.078 --> 14:53.546
No, I've never
been this way

14:53.547 --> 14:55.515
with anyone
else before.

14:55.515 --> 14:58.017
I know.
But you couldn't have known.

14:58.018 --> 14:59.519
Not really.

14:59.519 --> 15:03.322
Joe, I don't
want you to go.

15:03.323 --> 15:06.301
I want you
to run away.

15:06.302 --> 15:08.737
You don't want me
to see Paris, France,

15:08.737 --> 15:10.238
that's all.

15:21.016 --> 15:23.459
Don't go, Joe.
Please don't go.

15:23.460 --> 15:25.762
Run away.

15:25.762 --> 15:26.763
Where to? Shipyards?

15:27.230 --> 15:28.664
Anywhere.

15:28.665 --> 15:30.433
I'll hide you,
honest I will.

15:30.934 --> 15:33.236
Want me to be
a slacker, huh?

15:33.236 --> 15:34.637
Yes.

15:34.638 --> 15:37.841
Oh, they'll kill you,
Joe. I know they will.

15:37.841 --> 15:40.844
In the words of
that great patriot

15:40.844 --> 15:42.779
Theodore Roosevelt--

15:42.779 --> 15:44.747
I love you, Joe.

15:44.748 --> 15:47.617
Hold me closer.

15:47.617 --> 15:50.119
Put both your arms
around me.

15:50.120 --> 15:52.021
Both of them.

15:57.360 --> 15:59.362
Let us pray.

16:01.765 --> 16:02.766
Our Father--

16:06.303 --> 16:09.239
I can't pray like that.

16:09.239 --> 16:11.082
All I can say is
dear God,

16:11.516 --> 16:13.351
don't make him go away.

16:13.351 --> 16:15.753
Don't let him be killed.
I won't be.

16:15.753 --> 16:18.689
All aboard!

16:20.592 --> 16:21.626
All aboard!

17:37.969 --> 17:39.904
<i>Why don't they turn the lights on?</i>

17:42.640 --> 17:44.108
<i>It's dark in here.</i>

17:47.045 --> 17:49.555
<i>It's dark and still,</i>

17:49.555 --> 17:53.967
<i>and I can feel the blood</i>
<i>pumping through my veins.</i>

17:53.967 --> 17:56.803
<i>But I can't hear</i>
<i>the pulse in my ears.</i>

17:59.740 --> 18:01.683
<i>If you can't hear</i>
<i>your own pulse, you're deaf.</i>

18:02.184 --> 18:03.652
<i>You're deaf, Joe.</i>

18:03.652 --> 18:05.620
<i>Deaf.</i>

18:07.423 --> 18:10.859
<i>Maybe not.</i>
<i>Maybe I'm just dreaming.</i>

18:10.859 --> 18:13.261
<i>Maybe-- oh, Jesus</i>
<i>Christ, I hurt!</i>

18:16.665 --> 18:21.169
<i>I can feel the sweat</i>
<i>pouring out of my skin.</i>

18:21.170 --> 18:24.139
<i>Hot, wet skin that's</i>
<i>all covered up with--</i>

18:24.540 --> 18:26.450
<i>with bandages.</i>

18:26.450 --> 18:28.752
<i>Even my head.</i>

18:28.752 --> 18:31.554
<i>I sure must've</i>
<i>caught a big one.</i>

18:33.490 --> 18:34.958
<i>No.</i>

18:34.959 --> 18:36.927
<i>Telephones in the middle</i>
<i>of the night</i>

18:36.927 --> 18:38.395
<i>are bad luck.</i>

18:38.395 --> 18:41.197
<i>Don't let anybody</i>
<i>answer it, Father.</i>

18:43.200 --> 18:45.202
<i>What's this? Footsteps.</i>

18:45.202 --> 18:47.704
<i>I can feel</i>
<i>their vibrations.</i>

18:54.111 --> 18:55.912
<i>What are they doing?</i>

18:57.414 --> 18:59.416
Any evidence of
hypostasis

18:59.416 --> 19:00.417
while aspirating?

19:00.918 --> 19:02.352
None thus far.

19:08.342 --> 19:10.344
<i>They're looking</i>
<i>at something.</i>

19:10.344 --> 19:11.845
Trachea tube clear.

19:14.167 --> 19:15.635
<i>A hand on my chest.</i>

19:15.635 --> 19:17.169
He's breathing well.

19:19.673 --> 19:22.676
No more oxygen unless
an emergency develops.

19:24.685 --> 19:26.186
<i>I don't understand that.</i>

19:26.187 --> 19:28.088
Can you lift for
intravenous feeling?

19:28.089 --> 19:29.557
Good.

19:31.559 --> 19:33.060
<i>My face.</i>

19:33.060 --> 19:34.461
<i>Is something wrong</i>
<i>with my face?</i>

19:34.462 --> 19:35.896
Skin grafts will
be necessary here.

19:37.865 --> 19:39.867
Colostomy good.

19:39.867 --> 19:42.236
Cystotomy functioning?

19:42.236 --> 19:43.737
Uh-huh.
Very good.

19:43.738 --> 19:44.646
<i>What next?</i>

19:44.646 --> 19:46.147
Is the ambulance
ready? Yes, sir.

19:46.148 --> 19:47.649
Very well.
Bring him along.

19:47.649 --> 19:49.659
Where are you
taking him, sir?

19:49.660 --> 19:52.095
Occupation forces
base hospital

19:52.096 --> 19:54.431
number 3 at
Jeanville St. Clears.

19:56.934 --> 19:59.937
All right.
Let's move it.

19:59.937 --> 20:00.938
<i>David's Perfection Bakery.</i>

20:00.938 --> 20:01.939
<i>Rudy McKenna speaking.</i>

20:01.939 --> 20:03.440
<i>It's Rudy.</i>

20:03.440 --> 20:04.441
<i>Telephone, Joe.</i>

20:04.441 --> 20:05.942
<i>Okay, coming.</i>

20:10.948 --> 20:12.382
Hello.

20:19.056 --> 20:21.825
Yes, Mother.
I'll be right home.

20:32.277 --> 20:34.145
Thank you.
I'll let you know

20:34.146 --> 20:36.148
when everything's
finished, okay? Okay, Joe.

20:36.648 --> 20:38.149
I'll be back to work
in a couple days.

20:38.150 --> 20:41.553
That's all right.
Rest up. Good night.

22:52.725 --> 22:55.227
I'm sorry, Father.

22:56.729 --> 22:59.732
I'm sorry I lost
your fishing pole, too.

23:01.710 --> 23:03.712
I loved you.

23:17.125 --> 23:20.128
<i>Well, the bandages</i>
<i>are off my arm.</i>

23:20.629 --> 23:22.130
<i>It itches.</i>

23:22.130 --> 23:24.132
<i>I wish they'd</i>
<i>scratch it.</i>

23:26.134 --> 23:27.135
<i>What happens now?</i>

23:27.135 --> 23:29.549
Yes, we can remove
the sutures.

23:29.550 --> 23:32.563
Let's disinfect.

23:32.563 --> 23:34.565
<i>I wish they'd get</i>
<i>this stuff off my face</i>

23:34.565 --> 23:36.567
<i>so I could see</i>
<i>what they're doing.</i>

23:36.567 --> 23:38.068
Sorry, sir.
Another.

23:48.020 --> 23:49.430
<i>Ouch!</i>

23:49.430 --> 23:50.364
<i>They're pinching me.</i>

23:50.364 --> 23:52.799
<i>No, it's more like a--</i>

23:52.800 --> 23:55.702
<i>a little stab of heat.</i>

23:55.703 --> 23:57.671
<i>Wait a minute.</i>
<i>I know.</i>

23:57.672 --> 23:59.040
<i>It's just like when</i>
<i>I ran into</i>

23:59.040 --> 24:00.941
<i>the barbed-wire fence</i>
<i>and cut my eyebrow.</i>

24:00.942 --> 24:02.710
<i>They sew you up,</i>
<i>and then it heals,</i>

24:03.211 --> 24:05.213
<i>and then they take</i>
<i>the stitches out.</i>

24:05.713 --> 24:08.557
<i>Only-- Well, only</i>
<i>this is different.</i>

24:08.558 --> 24:10.560
<i>I can feel what they're</i>
<i>doing to my arm,</i>

24:10.560 --> 24:13.003
<i>but I can't feel the end</i>
<i>of my arm at all.</i>

24:13.004 --> 24:15.014
<i>The nearest thing</i>
<i>to the end of my arm</i>

24:15.281 --> 24:16.348
<i>is the heel of my hand.</i>

24:16.349 --> 24:20.861
<i>The heel of my hand,</i>
<i>the end of my arm.</i>

24:20.862 --> 24:22.864
<i>It's too high.</i>

24:22.864 --> 24:24.866
<i>It's high</i>
<i>as my shoulder.</i>

24:24.866 --> 24:27.869
<i>You've cut off my arm!</i>
The tissues have closed.

24:27.869 --> 24:29.370
<i>My arm! Oh, my God.</i>
Remove the wrist.

24:29.871 --> 24:31.172
<i>Why did you do</i>
<i>a thing like that?</i>

24:31.339 --> 24:32.406
<i>I need that arm.</i>

24:32.406 --> 24:34.908
<i>Oh, I've gotta</i>
<i>work with it. I--</i>

24:36.410 --> 24:38.412
<i>You can't go around</i>
<i>cutting a man's arm off,</i>

24:38.412 --> 24:41.890
<i>like you were pruning</i>
<i>dead branches off a tree!</i>

24:41.891 --> 24:44.869
<i>Well, there's</i>
<i>a law or something!</i>

24:44.870 --> 24:45.871
<i>You've gotta get</i>
<i>his consent</i>

24:45.871 --> 24:47.305
<i>before you do</i>
<i>a thing like that.</i>

24:47.806 --> 24:48.807
<i>He's gotta sign a paper</i>

24:48.807 --> 24:50.308
<i>because a man</i>
<i>with only one arm</i>

24:50.308 --> 24:51.609
<i>is a cripple, and--</i>
<i>and all he can do</i>

24:51.877 --> 24:53.945
<i>is go around</i>
<i>selling pencils!</i>

24:59.451 --> 25:02.529
<i>Oh, no!</i>
<i>Not my other arm, too!</i>

25:02.839 --> 25:04.407
<i>No, no! Please, no.</i>

25:04.407 --> 25:05.383
<i>You've already taken</i>
<i>one of my arms--</i>

25:05.383 --> 25:07.885
I want him moved to
the least conspicuous room

25:07.886 --> 25:10.855
you can find,
for his own good.

25:10.855 --> 25:12.857
A room with a lock
and something over the windows

25:12.857 --> 25:13.858
so they can't peer
in at him.

25:14.359 --> 25:16.661
There isn't a decent
unoccupied room in the building.

25:16.661 --> 25:18.162
Utility room?
Supply room?

25:18.163 --> 25:19.339
Store room? Anything.

25:19.339 --> 25:20.840
He can't tell
the difference.

25:20.840 --> 25:22.842
Put someone
in here who can.

25:38.291 --> 25:39.792
<i>There's a game out there,</i>

25:39.793 --> 25:42.295
<i>and the stakes are high.</i>

25:42.295 --> 25:44.797
<i>And the guy who runs it</i>
<i>figures the averages</i>

25:44.798 --> 25:47.308
<i>all day long</i>
<i>and all night long.</i>

25:47.308 --> 25:50.811
<i>Once in a while,</i>
<i>he lets you steal a pot.</i>

25:50.812 --> 25:53.314
<i>But if you stay</i>
<i>in the game long enough,</i>

25:53.815 --> 25:55.316
<i>you've got to lose.</i>

25:55.316 --> 25:59.320
<i>And once you've lost,</i>
<i>there's no way back.</i>

25:59.320 --> 26:00.621
<i>No way at all.</i>

26:00.829 --> 26:02.397
Hit me.

26:04.333 --> 26:06.335
Pay 20.

26:06.335 --> 26:09.846
Christ, I sure could
do with a shot of whiskey.

26:09.846 --> 26:11.347
Help yourself.

26:12.849 --> 26:14.684
Bets down.

26:16.119 --> 26:17.495
How'd you learn that?

26:17.496 --> 26:19.973
I used to do it
at weddings.

26:19.973 --> 26:21.474
Hey, can you do
card tricks, too?

26:21.942 --> 26:22.909
Sure.

26:26.913 --> 26:28.915
Cards to the gamblers.

26:30.417 --> 26:32.394
Hit me.

26:32.394 --> 26:34.396
I'm just fine.

26:34.396 --> 26:35.397
Boy, I'm just fine.

26:35.397 --> 26:36.398
Hit me.

26:37.866 --> 26:39.834
Stan?

26:39.835 --> 26:41.803
Hit me,
but not too hard.

26:41.803 --> 26:42.737
Now, watch him get 21.

26:47.576 --> 26:49.077
Pay 21.

26:49.578 --> 26:51.012
It's a funny thing,

26:51.012 --> 26:52.413
I can do
almost everything

26:52.414 --> 26:54.315
but hit a 12.

26:54.316 --> 26:55.750
12 shouldn't be
any harder to hit

26:55.750 --> 26:56.726
then a 13, should it?

26:56.727 --> 26:58.228
Shouldn't be, but it is.

26:58.229 --> 27:00.540
That's nothing
but superstition.

27:00.540 --> 27:02.408
A 12 to hit
is just the same

27:02.408 --> 27:03.809
as any other
number above it,

27:03.810 --> 27:05.244
only better.

27:05.244 --> 27:08.588
Don't let anybody
tell you different.

27:11.000 --> 27:12.509
Assembly. What time
is it anyhow?

27:12.509 --> 27:14.944
Three Christmases
and 41 days.

27:16.923 --> 27:17.924
Time to go.

27:17.924 --> 27:20.726
If I don't make
that train, I miss--

27:20.727 --> 27:22.170
I miss a date to be killed

27:22.170 --> 27:23.638
on the 27th of June

27:23.638 --> 27:25.673
at 4:30 a.m.
in the morning.

27:26.174 --> 27:28.176
Not too good
for my kid, huh?

27:28.676 --> 27:30.119
He's only a year,
eight months,

27:30.119 --> 27:32.087
and smart as hell
already.

27:33.356 --> 27:35.224
Sure wish I could see
him when he was 5.

27:35.224 --> 27:38.493
You'll see him
when he's 50.

27:38.494 --> 27:40.963
And you'll still be 23.

27:40.964 --> 27:42.665
What the hell?
We're all gonna be killed.

27:42.665 --> 27:43.666
That's what we're here for.

27:44.167 --> 27:46.110
He's already got his.

27:46.511 --> 27:49.046
And the big Swede here,
he's gonna catch flu

27:49.547 --> 27:50.948
and die on shipboard.

27:52.951 --> 27:54.953
I'm gonna get buried
in a trench cave-in

27:54.953 --> 27:55.954
and smothered to death.

27:55.954 --> 27:58.389
Now, isn't that
a hell of way to go?

27:58.890 --> 28:00.391
Jeez.

28:00.825 --> 28:02.860
All aboard!

28:02.860 --> 28:05.229
Next stop, New York,

28:05.229 --> 28:08.232
Atlantic Ocean,
and Paris, France!

28:08.232 --> 28:09.199
What's this guy doing here?

28:09.200 --> 28:11.644
He ain't gonna get killed.

28:11.645 --> 28:13.087
Leave him alone.
He's all right.

28:13.087 --> 28:14.896
Come on, boys.
On your feet.

28:14.897 --> 28:16.406
We've got to make
that train.

28:16.406 --> 28:17.407
Are you going with us?

28:17.908 --> 28:20.277
Of course. I've got
lots of trains to handle.

28:20.277 --> 28:21.845
Lots of dead men.

28:21.845 --> 28:23.346
So many dead men,

28:23.347 --> 28:25.849
you wouldn't believe it.

28:55.646 --> 28:58.456
Not my legs! Not my legs, too!

28:58.457 --> 29:00.959
<i>Oh, God, no.</i>

29:00.959 --> 29:03.962
<i>Not my legs, too.</i>

29:04.463 --> 29:06.465
<i>Help me, somebody.</i>

29:06.465 --> 29:08.467
<i>Help me.</i>

29:08.467 --> 29:12.471
<i>Don't let them</i>
<i>cut my legs off.</i>

29:12.471 --> 29:16.441
<i>Don't let them take my legs, too.</i>

29:23.682 --> 29:25.684
<i>Jesus.</i>

29:25.684 --> 29:28.687
<i>They just went ahead</i>
<i>and chopped off everything.</i>

29:28.687 --> 29:30.696
<i>Of course,</i>
<i>it's a lot cheaper</i>

29:30.697 --> 29:33.700
<i>to cut a leg off</i>
<i>than fix it up.</i>

29:33.700 --> 29:37.704
<i>With a war going on,</i>
<i>they haven't got much time.</i>

29:37.704 --> 29:39.706
<i>Everybody is tired.</i>

29:41.708 --> 29:44.210
<i>But, what kind of doctor</i>
<i>would cut a man down</i>

29:44.210 --> 29:45.711
<i>to what I am now</i>

29:45.712 --> 29:47.213
<i>and still let him live?</i>

29:49.716 --> 29:51.718
<i>Do they have a bet on?</i>

29:53.219 --> 29:55.721
<i>Were they showing off</i>
<i>or something?</i>

29:57.223 --> 29:59.225
<i>Was it some kind</i>
<i>of experiment?</i>

30:01.227 --> 30:03.229
<i>No.</i>

30:03.229 --> 30:05.231
<i>Nobody would do</i>
<i>a thing like that</i>

30:05.231 --> 30:07.233
<i>to another man.</i>

30:07.233 --> 30:11.244
<i>Nobody could be</i>
<i>such a butcher.</i>

30:11.245 --> 30:12.246
My dear students,

30:12.646 --> 30:16.082
war has various meanings

30:16.083 --> 30:17.659
to various persons.

30:17.660 --> 30:19.161
To the scientist,

30:19.161 --> 30:22.564
war means that he
is actually set free

30:22.565 --> 30:25.434
to accomplish
his most brilliant

30:25.434 --> 30:27.944
and most imaginative
enterprises.

30:27.945 --> 30:28.946
For example,

30:28.946 --> 30:31.315
in previous wars,

30:31.315 --> 30:34.151
each injury has resulted

30:34.151 --> 30:37.053
in a very serious loss
to the taxpayers,

30:37.054 --> 30:40.290
the loss of a most
expensively trained soldier--

30:40.291 --> 30:42.960
or fighting unit,
as we call him now.

30:42.960 --> 30:44.861
However, in the next war,

30:44.862 --> 30:46.671
we shall be able to repair

30:46.672 --> 30:49.616
and deliver that
same fighting unit

30:49.616 --> 30:51.017
to the frontline trenches

30:51.018 --> 30:53.253
in three weeks
or even less.

30:53.253 --> 30:55.755
And all because

30:55.756 --> 30:58.567
of the radical
new techniques

30:58.568 --> 31:01.486
which this young man
has taught us.

31:01.486 --> 31:04.555
<i>I'm having a nightmare</i>
<i>that says I'm real.</i>

31:04.556 --> 31:07.025
<i>Wake me up, Mother,</i>
<i>and tell me I'm not real.</i>

31:07.526 --> 31:09.895
<i>I don't know where you are, my son,</i>

31:09.895 --> 31:11.329
<i>or what troubles you.</i>

31:11.330 --> 31:14.741
<i>Try to remember that God</i>
<i>is the only reality,</i>

31:14.741 --> 31:18.177
<i>and that you are made</i>
<i>in his image and likeness.</i>

31:18.178 --> 31:20.180
<i>And since you are</i>
<i>the perfect reflection</i>

31:20.180 --> 31:22.048
<i>of God's reality,</i>

31:22.549 --> 31:23.492
<i>you are real.</i>

31:23.492 --> 31:24.993
<i>You're wrong, Mother.</i>

31:24.994 --> 31:26.996
<i>It's a dream.</i>

31:26.996 --> 31:28.497
<i>It's got to be.</i>

31:28.998 --> 31:31.500
<i>Everything else</i>
<i>is true, but not this.</i>

31:31.500 --> 31:35.403
<i>No, I remember</i>
<i>the real things, Mother.</i>

31:35.404 --> 31:40.375
<i>Even before we left Colorado</i>
<i>and moved to Los Angeles.</i>

31:40.376 --> 31:42.378
<i>I remember everything.</i>

31:42.378 --> 31:43.345
Ouch.

31:43.345 --> 31:44.779
You hurt yourself,
son?

31:44.780 --> 31:47.290
Uh-uh.
Let's see.

31:50.227 --> 31:52.229
Oh, honestly.

31:52.229 --> 31:55.565
Someday those feet
are gonna get so dirty,

31:55.566 --> 31:58.001
they'll
never wash clean.

32:34.271 --> 32:37.707
From now on, I'm gonna
take my baths at the YMCA,

32:37.708 --> 32:40.043
the way Daddy does.

32:55.993 --> 32:59.229
For behold, I bring
you tidings of great joy

32:59.229 --> 33:02.065
that shall be
to all people.

33:02.066 --> 33:04.568
For unto you is
born this day

33:04.568 --> 33:07.571
in the city of David,
a savior,

33:07.571 --> 33:10.073
which is Christ the Lord.

33:10.074 --> 33:13.043
And suddenly there was
with the angel--

33:23.053 --> 33:25.063
See those rocks
over there?

33:25.064 --> 33:26.373
A long time ago,
they caught

33:26.540 --> 33:29.109
a hunting party
of Ute Indians there.

33:29.109 --> 33:32.612
Know what they did?
Rounded 'em up,

33:32.613 --> 33:34.915
tied rocks around their feet,
and threw 'em in the lake.

33:36.291 --> 33:38.293
About where we are now.

33:38.593 --> 33:43.164
The, uh, fishing on this
side of the lake's been good ever since.

33:49.249 --> 33:51.284
<i>Science and Health</i>
<i>with Key to the Scriptures,</i>

33:51.285 --> 33:52.786
by Mary Baker Eddy.

33:52.786 --> 33:55.296

33:55.297 --> 33:57.732

34:33.909 --> 34:35.409
<i>Reality is God.</i>

34:35.411 --> 34:37.913

34:37.913 --> 34:39.414
<i>that perfect love</i>

34:39.415 --> 34:40.916
<i>which banishes all fear</i>

34:40.916 --> 34:43.670

34:43.972 --> 34:46.040
<i>Stop it. I don't</i>
<i>want to hear anymore</i>

34:46.040 --> 34:48.042
<i>about God is love.</i>
Prepare an injection.

34:48.042 --> 34:49.043
<i>Because If I do,</i>
<i>I'll begin to hate him.</i>

34:49.043 --> 34:51.027
When did you
aspirate him last? 4:30.

34:51.027 --> 34:52.529
Gavage feeding?

34:52.530 --> 34:54.532
2:00 and again at 4.

35:02.540 --> 35:04.542
<i>No, no.</i>
<i>Don't put me under again.</i>

35:04.542 --> 35:07.044
<i>I've gotta figure</i>
<i>some way out of this mess.</i>

35:08.520 --> 35:11.523
<i>Father, I need help.</i>

35:11.523 --> 35:14.025
<i>I'm in terrible trouble,</i>
<i>and I need help.</i>

35:14.026 --> 35:16.528
<i>Father?</i>
<i>Did you hear me?</i>

35:16.528 --> 35:17.996
Father?

35:17.997 --> 35:20.899
I hear ya, son. But I
got troubles of my own.

35:20.899 --> 35:26.121
Nothing I have in this world
is really any good, you know?

35:26.122 --> 35:29.066
My house is small.
My job is small.

35:29.066 --> 35:32.369
My salary is also small.

35:32.370 --> 35:36.481
Son is small.
So is my wife,

35:36.482 --> 35:38.851
and get right down to it,
I'm no giant, myself.

35:39.852 --> 35:41.820
Everything
around me is small,

35:42.321 --> 35:44.289
inferior,

35:44.289 --> 35:47.692
except this fishing pole.

35:48.594 --> 35:51.129
I, myself,
wind it every year

35:51.130 --> 35:52.931
with the best
of silk thread.

35:52.931 --> 35:54.841
See this lacquer?

35:55.275 --> 35:57.653
Comes from China.

35:57.653 --> 35:59.588
No finer lacquer
in the world.

36:04.594 --> 36:05.995
See those guides?

36:05.995 --> 36:07.429
Pure amber.

36:09.340 --> 36:11.308
Nobody in town has
a fishing pole like this.

36:11.809 --> 36:14.311
Not even Mr. Ladamer
down at the bank.

36:15.780 --> 36:17.782
My life is so poor
and shoddy

36:17.782 --> 36:20.184
that without this pole,
why,

36:20.184 --> 36:23.554
I'd have nothing to set me
apart from other men.

36:23.554 --> 36:27.090
Nothing to give me distinction,
nothing at all.

36:27.091 --> 36:31.428
That's why
I love it so much.

36:31.429 --> 36:33.898
Do you love it more
than you love me?

36:34.365 --> 36:35.866
'Course I do.

36:35.867 --> 36:39.136
What is there about you
that can give a man distinction?

36:39.137 --> 36:41.038
You're not unusual at all.

36:41.539 --> 36:42.973
Yes I am, Father.

36:42.974 --> 36:44.675
How's that?

36:44.876 --> 36:46.878
I may not be
unusual now,

36:46.878 --> 36:49.046
but I'm going to be.

36:49.347 --> 36:51.349
Of course you are.

36:51.349 --> 36:53.751
You're gonna make the world
safe for democracy, aren't ya?

36:54.118 --> 36:55.586
What is democracy?

36:59.490 --> 37:01.391
Well, I was never very
clear on it, myself.

37:03.427 --> 37:05.862
Like every other
kind of government,

37:05.863 --> 37:08.165
it's got something to do
with young men

37:08.166 --> 37:09.567
killing each other,
I believe.

37:10.902 --> 37:12.911
Why don't old men
kill each other?

37:12.911 --> 37:14.279
Well, the old men
are needed

37:14.280 --> 37:16.215
to keep the home
fires burning.

37:16.215 --> 37:19.102
Couldn't the young men
do that just as well?

37:19.102 --> 37:21.337
Young men don't have homes.

37:21.338 --> 37:23.206
That's why they must go out
and kill each other.

37:24.708 --> 37:27.744
When it comes my turn,

37:27.744 --> 37:29.145
will you want me to go?

37:30.981 --> 37:32.958
For democracy,

37:32.958 --> 37:35.827
any man would give
his only begotten son.

37:37.138 --> 37:38.005
I wouldn't.

37:46.689 --> 37:48.691
I won't be here
to stop you, Joe.

37:54.697 --> 37:56.198
Put your arms around me.

37:56.432 --> 37:58.867
I need their warmth

37:58.868 --> 38:01.604
to keep the chill
of death away.

38:03.372 --> 38:04.272
I can't.

38:07.584 --> 38:09.485
Please?

38:09.486 --> 38:10.987
No!

38:18.228 --> 38:20.563
Well...

38:20.564 --> 38:21.598
I guess it always
comes down to that.

38:24.101 --> 38:26.603
Each man faces
death by himself.

38:26.603 --> 38:29.439
Alone.

38:29.773 --> 38:30.840
From now on, it's
a simple matter

38:30.841 --> 38:32.142
of good nursing care,

38:33.377 --> 38:35.320
I can always be
reached at GHQ

38:35.320 --> 38:36.754
if anything develops.

38:36.755 --> 38:39.090
Let's try the mask.

38:39.090 --> 38:40.591
<i>Thank God. They're</i>
<i>finally getting</i>

38:40.592 --> 38:42.560
<i>this stuff off my face.</i>

38:42.561 --> 38:43.495
<i>The air feels good.</i>

38:43.995 --> 38:45.496
<i>Feels cool.</i>

38:48.366 --> 38:50.776
Repairs seem to
have healed well.

38:53.280 --> 38:55.282
<i>What's this?</i>

38:55.282 --> 38:56.783
You see?

38:56.783 --> 38:58.284
Works very well.

38:58.285 --> 38:59.786
Any questions?

39:00.687 --> 39:02.622
Good luck.

39:02.622 --> 39:04.123
<i>It's better.</i>

39:04.124 --> 39:05.625
<i>It does let</i>
<i>the air in.</i>

39:05.625 --> 39:07.627
<i>But I thought when</i>
<i>they unbandaged my face,</i>

39:07.627 --> 39:09.595
<i>I'd be all healed.</i>

39:25.178 --> 39:27.146
<i>She's cleaning</i>
<i>my breathing tube.</i>

39:28.448 --> 39:30.391
<i>I thought when they took</i>
<i>this stuff off my face,</i>

39:30.392 --> 39:33.061
<i>they'd take</i>
<i>the tubes out, too.</i>

39:34.029 --> 39:35.964
<i>But they didn't.</i>

39:35.964 --> 39:37.432
<i>I don't understand.</i>

39:39.434 --> 39:41.411
<i>Where is she going now?</i>

39:52.790 --> 39:54.291
<i>Oh, yes. I know.</i>

39:56.802 --> 39:59.604
<i>I've still got</i>
<i>my feeding tube.</i>

39:59.805 --> 40:03.809
<i>When am I gonna</i>
<i>be able to feed myself?</i>

40:04.310 --> 40:06.278
<i>When am I going to get well?</i>

40:12.051 --> 40:13.852
<i>Dinner's over.</i>

40:13.853 --> 40:16.655
<i>But it won't always</i>
<i>be like this, will it?</i>

40:16.889 --> 40:18.957
<i>Now wait.</i>

40:20.726 --> 40:21.860
<i>Think for a minute.</i>

40:21.861 --> 40:22.862
<i>There's something</i>
<i>funny here--</i>

40:22.862 --> 40:24.797
<i>something cool,</i>
<i>something wet.</i>

40:24.797 --> 40:26.799
<i>I thought my face</i>
<i>was just wrapped up,</i>

40:26.799 --> 40:28.767
<i>when they unwrapped it,</i>
<i>I could--</i>

40:29.201 --> 40:32.070
<i>Oh. Oh, please, I--</i>

40:32.071 --> 40:33.972
<i>Now, get a hold</i>
<i>of yourself, Joe.</i>

40:33.973 --> 40:35.941
<i>Don't lose your head.</i>

40:35.941 --> 40:37.342
<i>Your jaws.</i>

40:37.343 --> 40:38.844
<i>You can't move your jaws.</i>

40:41.847 --> 40:43.849
<i>They don't work.</i>

40:43.849 --> 40:45.358
<i>You haven't got any.</i>

40:45.359 --> 40:47.260
<i>Well, take your tongue, rub</i>
<i>it around inside your teeth</i>

40:47.260 --> 40:49.262
<i>like you were chasing</i>
<i>a raspberry seed.</i>

40:50.764 --> 40:53.166
<i>I-- I haven't got any tongue!</i>

40:53.166 --> 40:55.902
<i>I-- I haven't got</i>
<i>any teeth for it to feel.</i>

40:56.403 --> 40:58.905
<i>I haven't got anything</i>
<i>here but a hole.</i>

40:59.406 --> 41:00.240
<i>How big is it?</i>

41:00.240 --> 41:02.742
<i>How-- How does it go?</i>

41:02.743 --> 41:05.754
<i>Now don't panic.</i>

41:05.754 --> 41:08.256
<i>Think.</i>

41:08.256 --> 41:11.767
<i>Inside of the hole is--</i>
<i>is wet.</i>

41:11.768 --> 41:14.670
<i>The edges of it are dry.</i>

41:14.671 --> 41:16.114
<i>Wet, dry.</i>

41:16.115 --> 41:17.850
<i>Yes, that's it.</i>

41:17.850 --> 41:19.693
<i>Now, figure out</i>
<i>where it's dry.</i>

41:19.693 --> 41:21.670
<i>Feel. Yes.</i>

41:22.113 --> 41:23.547
<i>I'm feeling.</i>

41:23.548 --> 41:27.285
<i>Dry-- And shouldn't</i>
<i>the hole go up?</i>

41:27.285 --> 41:28.753
<i>Up.</i>

41:28.753 --> 41:31.021
<i>No eyes.</i>

41:31.022 --> 41:32.490
<i>I haven't got any eyes</i>

41:32.490 --> 41:33.924
<i>or mouth or teeth,</i>
<i>tongue, or nose.</i>

41:33.925 --> 41:34.934
<i>I haven't gotten anything,</i>

41:34.934 --> 41:36.902
<i>but my whole face</i>
<i>is scooped out!</i>

41:36.903 --> 41:39.772
<i>Oh, Jesus Christ,</i>
<i>it's me, and I'm alive!</i>

41:39.773 --> 41:41.182
<i>Oh, no. It can't be!</i>

41:41.683 --> 41:44.585
<i>Not me! I--</i>
<i>I can't live like this!</i>

41:44.586 --> 41:46.087
<i>I-- I can't.</i>

41:46.087 --> 41:47.488
<i>Please, no, I can't--</i>
<i>I can't!</i>

41:47.489 --> 41:48.965
<i>Help me. Somebody</i>
<i>please help me.</i>

41:48.965 --> 41:51.400
<i>Mother, where are ya?</i>

41:51.401 --> 41:52.902
<i>Help me, Mother.</i>
<i>I'm having a nightmare</i>

41:52.902 --> 41:54.803
<i>and I can't wake up.</i>

41:54.804 --> 41:58.274
<i>If you don't wake me up</i>
<i>I'll be like this for years</i>

41:58.274 --> 41:59.208
<i>and years</i>

41:59.208 --> 42:01.076
<i>and years</i>

42:08.217 --> 42:11.620
<i>Pray for me, please.</i>

42:11.621 --> 42:14.123
<i>Please, pray for me.</i>

42:14.123 --> 42:17.626
To all those
in the armed forces

42:17.627 --> 42:21.631
who sacrificed
their young lives

42:21.631 --> 42:25.134
in this just and holy war

42:25.134 --> 42:28.137
for everlasting peace,

42:28.137 --> 42:33.642
I grant absolution
of all their sins.

42:33.643 --> 42:35.144
In the name of the Father

42:35.144 --> 42:36.645
and of the Son

42:37.146 --> 42:39.648
and of the
Holy Ghost, amen.

42:39.649 --> 42:41.651
Let us pray.

42:49.425 --> 42:51.435
<i>A place like this,</i>
<i>you've gotta think</i>

42:51.436 --> 42:54.939
<i>in order to keep</i>
<i>from thinking.</i>

42:54.939 --> 42:56.440
<i>There are eight planets,</i>

42:56.441 --> 42:59.844
<i>Earth, Venus,</i>

42:59.844 --> 43:02.146
<i>Mars, Jupiter,</i>

43:02.614 --> 43:06.451
<i>Mercury--</i>
<i>What's that?</i>

43:06.451 --> 43:08.886
<i>There's something</i>
<i>chewing on my forehead.</i>

43:10.788 --> 43:12.264
<i>It's a rat!</i>

43:12.265 --> 43:13.766
<i>It's one of those great</i>
<i>big fat trench rats.</i>

43:13.766 --> 43:17.144
<i>Help me, somebody.</i>
<i>Kill it!</i>

43:17.145 --> 43:19.589
<i>No, couldn't be a rat.</i>

43:20.056 --> 43:21.490
<i>They wouldn't let</i>
<i>rats run around</i>

43:21.491 --> 43:23.392
<i>chewing up the customers</i>
<i>in a place like this.</i>

43:23.927 --> 43:25.428
<i>It's a dream.</i>

43:26.896 --> 43:27.897
<i>No, it isn't.</i>

43:27.897 --> 43:29.398
<i>It is a rat.</i>

43:29.399 --> 43:31.868
<i>It's crawling.</i>
<i>It's crawling.</i>

43:31.868 --> 43:33.803
<i>No. No, no, no, no.</i>

43:33.803 --> 43:36.572
<i>Don't--</i>
<i>Don't let it get me.</i>

43:36.573 --> 43:39.309
<i>No. No, no. No, no, no.</i>

43:39.309 --> 43:42.654
<i>He's close.</i>

43:42.654 --> 43:44.622
<i>He's on my chest.</i>

43:45.124 --> 43:47.059
<i>Don't even scare him.</i>

43:48.527 --> 43:50.882
<i>Hold still and he will--</i>

43:53.485 --> 43:54.953
<i>Where'd it go?</i>

43:54.953 --> 43:56.354
<i>Did somebody kill it?</i>

43:56.354 --> 43:58.122
<i>Or did it just go away?</i>

43:58.398 --> 44:01.343
<i>What if it comes back?</i>

44:01.343 --> 44:02.777
<i>It was a dream.</i>

44:02.778 --> 44:05.147
<i>It had to be.</i>

44:05.147 --> 44:06.648
<i>But how can you tell</i>

44:07.149 --> 44:08.158
<i>what's a dream</i>
<i>and what's real</i>

44:08.159 --> 44:10.094
<i>when you can't even</i>
<i>tell when you're awake</i>

44:10.094 --> 44:11.595
<i>and when you're asleep?</i>

44:12.930 --> 44:14.364
<i>Or maybe the rat's real</i>

44:14.365 --> 44:15.833
<i>and the nurse here</i>
<i>is a dream.</i>

44:16.300 --> 44:20.504
<i>Oh, Jesus Christ,</i>
<i>how can I ever be able to tell the difference?</i>

44:20.504 --> 44:23.440
The thing to do is yell.

44:23.440 --> 44:26.409
Sometimes, even now,
I have this old dream

44:26.911 --> 44:28.412
that somebody
wants to kill me.

44:28.412 --> 44:29.921
And my mother and father
are running away

44:29.921 --> 44:31.756
with me to Egypt.

44:31.757 --> 44:33.759
I hear the sound of
soldiers riding at night

44:33.759 --> 44:35.560
and the screams.

44:35.560 --> 44:36.861
And I yell.

44:36.862 --> 44:38.905
And the yell wakes me up.

44:38.905 --> 44:41.315
And then I know
that it's a dream.

44:41.316 --> 44:43.251
So what you have
to do is yell.

44:43.251 --> 44:45.253
But, you see,
I can't yell.

44:45.753 --> 44:47.755
I can't even whisper.

44:47.755 --> 44:50.758
Well, whispering
wouldn't help anyhow.

44:50.758 --> 44:54.762
Another way is just
to tell yourself

44:54.762 --> 44:59.233
"Wait a minute, here.
This is a nightmare.

44:59.234 --> 45:01.669
"And I have to wake up
in order to stop it."

45:01.669 --> 45:02.670
Then just force
your eyes open,

45:03.104 --> 45:04.655
and the dream
will be gone.

45:04.655 --> 45:06.990
Oh, I can't open my eyes.
I haven't got any.

45:12.329 --> 45:14.097
Well, that complicates things.

45:16.100 --> 45:17.534
Maybe the thing to do

45:17.535 --> 45:20.471
is police your mind
before you go to sleep.

45:20.471 --> 45:22.473
Say to yourself,

45:22.473 --> 45:24.908
"I'm going to sleep now.

45:24.909 --> 45:28.212
"And I'm not going
to have any nightmares."

45:28.212 --> 45:30.547
Could be done, you know?
With practice.

45:33.918 --> 45:35.694
You feel yourself
getting drowsy--

45:35.694 --> 45:37.562
I never feel drowsy.

45:37.563 --> 45:39.398
I haven't got anything
to feel drowsy with.

45:42.201 --> 45:43.969
Nothing?

46:20.339 --> 46:22.341
Maybe we should

46:22.341 --> 46:23.809
take a different
line of attack,

46:23.809 --> 46:25.243
altogether.

46:25.244 --> 46:28.113
Let us begin
by assuming

46:28.113 --> 46:29.455
that everything
is a dream,

46:29.456 --> 46:31.800
which by and large,
it is.

46:31.800 --> 46:33.201
When we're awake,
we have one kind of dream.

46:33.710 --> 46:34.644
When we're asleep,
we have another.

46:35.145 --> 46:36.646
The difference is

46:36.647 --> 46:38.649
that we control
our daydreams.

46:38.649 --> 46:40.584
And the dream
that comes at night

46:40.584 --> 46:43.086
controls us.

46:43.086 --> 46:45.588
Now think about that.

46:45.589 --> 46:49.100
When you dream that
the rat is there,

46:49.100 --> 46:51.602
do you control the dream?

46:51.603 --> 46:53.071
Or does the dream
control you?

46:53.071 --> 46:54.480
It controls me.

46:54.914 --> 46:56.866
Yes, exactly.

46:56.867 --> 46:58.368
If the rat
were really there,

46:58.368 --> 47:00.303
you'd knock it off,
wouldn't you?

47:00.303 --> 47:01.704
Of course.

47:01.705 --> 47:03.623
So the fact that
you don't knock it off

47:03.623 --> 47:06.166
proves that
it really is a dream.

47:06.167 --> 47:08.469
Yes, yes.

47:08.470 --> 47:10.972
I--

47:10.972 --> 47:13.307
That doesn't work.

47:13.808 --> 47:16.143
Even if the rat was real,
I couldn't knock it off

47:16.144 --> 47:17.478
because I haven't
got any arms.

47:20.715 --> 47:21.682
No arms.

47:21.683 --> 47:23.685
I haven't got anything.

47:23.685 --> 47:25.586
I'm just like a piece of meat

47:26.087 --> 47:27.555
that keeps on living.

47:32.902 --> 47:35.838
Since your real life--

47:35.839 --> 47:38.074
is a greater nightmare
than your dreams,

47:39.542 --> 47:40.976
it would be cruel

47:40.977 --> 47:44.480
to pretend that anyone
could help you.

47:46.924 --> 47:48.425
What you need is a miracle.

47:48.426 --> 47:49.911
No, not a miracle.

47:50.412 --> 47:51.929
Just tell me
that the rat is real.

47:51.930 --> 47:54.933
And the way I am now
is a dream.

47:54.933 --> 47:56.410
Perhaps it would be
better for you

47:56.410 --> 47:57.911
to go away now.

47:57.911 --> 47:59.412
You're a very
unlucky young man,

47:59.413 --> 48:00.922
and sometimes
it rubs off.

48:00.923 --> 48:03.425
I'll go, but first
tell me just one thing.

48:03.425 --> 48:05.927
Are you and I
really here together?

48:06.436 --> 48:07.962
Or is this
a dream, too?

48:07.963 --> 48:09.473
It's a dream.
How do you know?

48:09.473 --> 48:12.484
Because I'm a dream.
I don't believe you.

48:12.485 --> 48:15.454
Nobody does.

48:15.455 --> 48:17.865
That's why I'm as unreal

48:17.865 --> 48:20.734
as every other dream
that didn't come true.

48:25.906 --> 48:27.407
<i>I don't know whether</i>
<i>I'm alive and dreaming</i>

48:27.408 --> 48:29.368
<i>or dead and remembering.</i>

48:29.368 --> 48:31.286
<i>Am I getting old?</i>

48:31.287 --> 48:32.788
<i>Is my hair turning gray?</i>

48:32.789 --> 48:35.291
<i>Will anybody ever</i>
<i>come to visit me?</i>

48:35.792 --> 48:37.126
<i>I hope not.</i>

48:37.126 --> 48:38.560
<i>I really wouldn't</i>
<i>want anybody</i>

48:38.561 --> 48:40.896
<i>to see me like this.</i>

48:40.897 --> 48:43.774
<i>I do get homesick, though.</i>

48:43.775 --> 48:46.285
<i>Oh, but they wouldn't</i>
<i>have shipped me that long way home.</i>

48:46.286 --> 48:48.797
<i>Not with all these</i>
<i>tubes and things in me.</i>

48:49.297 --> 48:51.799
<i>No, I'm probably in</i>
<i>some frog hospital,</i>

48:51.800 --> 48:53.802
<i>or maybe limey.</i>

48:53.802 --> 48:56.304
<i>At least my teeth</i>
<i>don't ache.</i>

48:57.238 --> 48:59.716
<i>Wait a minute.</i>
<i>What's this?</i>

48:59.717 --> 49:01.218
<i>There are two</i>
<i>vibrations,</i>

49:01.218 --> 49:02.686
<i>and one of them</i>
<i>is heavy.</i>

49:02.686 --> 49:04.187
<i>It's a man.</i>

49:04.188 --> 49:07.098
Why are the shutters
closed?

49:07.099 --> 49:08.108
They always have been.

49:08.608 --> 49:10.543
At least, as long
as I've been here.

49:10.544 --> 49:12.554
It's on the order sheet.

49:12.554 --> 49:13.997
Well, it's crazy.

49:13.997 --> 49:16.507
<i>Well,</i>
<i>what are you doing?</i>

49:16.508 --> 49:18.510
<i>Hello? Have I</i>
<i>got visitors?</i>

49:18.510 --> 49:20.011
<i>What happened then?</i>

49:20.011 --> 49:21.512
As long as I'm
head nurse of this ward,

49:21.513 --> 49:24.349
the shutters are open
and they will stay open.

49:24.349 --> 49:26.158
Let him have
a little sunshine.

49:26.159 --> 49:27.593
They said it was
to keep people

49:27.593 --> 49:28.560
from peeking
in at him.

49:30.096 --> 49:31.573
It would take a man
7 feet tall

49:31.573 --> 49:33.575
to peek through that window.

49:33.575 --> 49:35.076
Oh, and another thing.

49:35.577 --> 49:36.578
I want sheets
on this bed.

49:36.979 --> 49:39.290
<i>He's walking.</i>
No more blankets.

49:39.290 --> 49:41.267
He can't really
tell the difference, you know.

49:41.267 --> 49:43.168
<i>Now he's stopped.</i>
I can.

49:47.073 --> 49:49.442
Well.

49:49.442 --> 49:53.345
How did the triage officer
ever overlook this one?

49:57.350 --> 49:58.696
<i>He's looking at me.</i>

49:59.197 --> 50:00.569
Poor baby.

50:05.942 --> 50:07.451
<i>No, it's a woman.</i>

50:07.451 --> 50:08.885
<i>Those hands, a fat woman.</i>

50:08.886 --> 50:10.787
<i>That's why I could feel</i>
<i>her footsteps so plain.</i>

50:10.788 --> 50:13.657
Poor-- Poor baby.

50:17.895 --> 50:18.896
Come on.

50:28.005 --> 50:29.448
<i>That was funny.</i>

50:29.949 --> 50:31.383
<i>What were they doing?</i>
<i>What has happened?</i>

50:31.384 --> 50:32.860
<i>What's different?</i>

50:33.327 --> 50:34.803
<i>Think, Joe.</i>

50:34.804 --> 50:35.805
<i>Think. Use your head.</i>

50:35.805 --> 50:37.740
<i>Feel.</i>
<i>Feel with your scalp</i>

50:37.740 --> 50:39.208
<i>and the skin</i>
<i>on your forehead.</i>

50:39.208 --> 50:40.642
<i>Something has changed.</i>

50:40.643 --> 50:43.588
<i>It was cooler before</i>
<i>she came in than it is now.</i>

50:43.588 --> 50:46.023
<i>What I feel is--</i>
<i>is warmth.</i>

50:46.424 --> 50:47.758
<i>But where does it come from?</i>

50:47.759 --> 50:50.661
<i>Yes. Yes, yes, yes.</i>
<i>Of course.</i>

50:50.662 --> 50:52.664
<i>Oh, my God. I see it now.</i>

50:52.664 --> 50:55.133
It-- It's the sun.

50:55.133 --> 50:57.135
<i>The sun, the sun, the sun.</i>

50:57.135 --> 51:00.346
<i>I found the sun.</i>

51:00.347 --> 51:03.183
<i>Thank you, God.</i>

51:03.650 --> 51:07.720
Thank you. Thank you.

51:12.726 --> 51:14.736
If I never have
anything else,

51:14.736 --> 51:17.739
I'll always have God

51:17.739 --> 51:20.241
and the morning sunlight.

51:27.916 --> 51:29.296
<i>It's night.</i>

51:29.296 --> 51:30.642
<i>If a man can</i>
<i>tell the difference</i>

51:30.642 --> 51:31.442
<i>between day and night,</i>

51:31.943 --> 51:32.877
<i>he's beginning to tell time.</i>

51:32.877 --> 51:34.812
<i>It's warm again.</i>
<i>It's morning,</i>

51:35.313 --> 51:36.714
<i>and she's changing</i>
<i>my sheets.</i>

51:36.981 --> 51:38.482
<i>Now it's night.</i>

51:38.483 --> 51:40.701
<i>Morning again.</i>
<i>She's bathing me.</i>

51:40.701 --> 51:42.169
<i>One morning she changes me,</i>

51:42.169 --> 51:44.013
<i>the next morning,</i>
<i>she bathes me.</i>

51:44.014 --> 51:45.415
<i>Night, night.</i>

51:45.682 --> 51:47.016
<i>Day. Night.</i>

51:47.317 --> 51:48.626
<i>How will I keep track?</i>

51:48.926 --> 51:50.502
<i>I know.</i>
<i>Put a big blackboard up in your mind.</i>

51:50.503 --> 51:52.121
<i>And right here</i>
<i>in the middle,</i>

51:52.122 --> 51:53.699
<i>put a mark for each day.</i>

51:53.699 --> 51:56.125
<i>Four, six, seven days.</i>

51:56.125 --> 51:57.868
<i>Now, put a mark up</i>
<i>in this corner for the weeks.</i>

51:57.868 --> 51:59.936
<i>Erase the days.</i>
<i>Start over again.</i>

51:59.937 --> 52:01.817
<i>Three, four weeks.</i>
<i>That's right!</i>

52:01.817 --> 52:03.218
<i>Erase the weeks</i>
<i>and mark down</i>

52:03.219 --> 52:04.153
<i>a month over here.</i>

52:04.453 --> 52:07.522
<i>5, 9, 11, 12 months.</i>

52:07.523 --> 52:08.464
<i>Now that isn't a year,</i>
<i>not yet.</i>

52:08.965 --> 52:10.032
<i>Four twelves is only 48.</i>

52:10.033 --> 52:12.376
<i>Okay, check off</i>
<i>four more weeks,</i>

52:12.710 --> 52:13.855
<i>very carefully.</i>

52:14.089 --> 52:16.833
<i>And then put Roman</i>
<i>numeral number 1</i>

52:16.834 --> 52:19.303
<i>right down here. One year!</i>

52:19.303 --> 52:20.804
<i>I'm ringing bells!</i>

52:20.804 --> 52:22.205
<i>Hey, I'm blowing horns</i>

52:22.206 --> 52:23.540
<i>and shooting off</i>
<i>firecrackers.</i>

52:23.541 --> 52:25.009
<i>Everybody's singing</i>

52:25.009 --> 52:27.544
<i>"Should old acquaintance</i>
<i>be forgot."</i>

52:27.545 --> 52:29.547
<i>And I'm saying--</i>

52:29.547 --> 52:32.550
<i>I'm saying,</i>
<i>"Happy New Year, Kareen."</i>

52:32.550 --> 52:34.552
<i>And I'm kissing her.</i>

52:40.291 --> 52:42.726
<i>But it isn't</i>
<i>New Year's Day out there.</i>

52:42.726 --> 52:44.227
<i>Sure, I've counted a year,</i>

52:44.228 --> 52:46.129
<i>but a year from when?</i>

52:46.130 --> 52:48.407
<i>I don't even know</i>
<i>how old I am.</i>

52:48.408 --> 52:50.376
<i>All I know is</i>
<i>I'm 20 years old,</i>

52:50.843 --> 52:52.778
<i>plus X years since</i>
<i>I got blown up,</i>

52:52.779 --> 52:55.181
<i>plus the year I just counted.</i>

52:55.181 --> 52:57.591
<i>But when did</i>
<i>those X years begin?</i>

52:57.592 --> 53:00.027
<i>Think, Joe. Think back.</i>

53:00.461 --> 53:03.372
<i>We were next to</i>
<i>an English regiment.</i>

53:03.372 --> 53:05.874
<i>And we went out</i>
<i>on night patrol and scattered.</i>

53:05.875 --> 53:07.343
<i>And then I hooked up</i>

53:07.343 --> 53:08.844
<i>with that little</i>
<i>limey corporal</i>

53:08.845 --> 53:09.779
<i>and his outfit, and--</i>

53:09.779 --> 53:12.548
<i>Yes, I remember now.</i>

53:12.815 --> 53:14.825
<i>I was writing a letter</i>
<i>to you, Kareen.</i>

53:15.293 --> 53:16.294
Corporal Timlon?

53:16.294 --> 53:17.795
Yes, sir?

53:20.798 --> 53:23.809
What is that damnable odor?

53:23.810 --> 53:24.811
Out there, sir.

53:25.311 --> 53:27.813
This fat Hun came
stumbling through the fog.

53:27.814 --> 53:31.317
Some bloke lost his head
and popped him off.

53:31.317 --> 53:32.818
The stink ain't half so bad

53:33.119 --> 53:33.986
when they're close
to the ground, sir,

53:33.986 --> 53:36.021
but he's got himself
hung up on the wire.

53:36.022 --> 53:37.999
Bad for morale.
Extremely bad.

53:37.999 --> 53:41.002
He's a Bavarian, sir.
They always smell worse.

53:41.503 --> 53:43.004
Yes, they do,
don't they?

53:43.480 --> 53:46.483
Not so bad as Hindu is,
though. Or Welshmen.

53:46.483 --> 53:48.485
While it's nice and quiet,
sir, we keep on trying

53:48.485 --> 53:50.487
to shoot him down,
but he hangs on pretty good.

53:50.487 --> 53:52.989
Well, take a detail
out tonight, Corporal.

53:52.990 --> 53:54.491
And bury him.

53:54.491 --> 53:56.993
Well, but it's kind of
busy out there, sir. Even at night.

53:57.494 --> 53:59.496
And don't forget,
Corporal.

53:59.496 --> 54:01.998
Death has a dignity
all its own.

54:01.999 --> 54:06.010
And you will say
a few words of prayer over the remains.

54:06.511 --> 54:08.012
Yes.

54:10.015 --> 54:12.017
Oh, Jesus!

54:12.365 --> 54:14.371
Just for that,
I'll take volunteers.

54:14.372 --> 54:16.374
You. You. You.

54:16.374 --> 54:18.809
You two.
You in the back there.

54:18.810 --> 54:21.212
And to almighty God,

54:21.212 --> 54:24.949
we commend the soul of
our brother departed,

54:24.949 --> 54:27.685
and we commit his body
to the ground.

54:34.092 --> 54:37.806
Earth to earth,
ashes to ashes,

54:37.807 --> 54:40.109
dust to dust.

54:40.109 --> 54:41.777
Who's got the dust?

54:43.713 --> 54:46.048
It's kinda wet, but--

54:46.048 --> 54:47.049
I have--

54:47.049 --> 54:51.028
Well, throw the bloody
stuff in. Go on.

54:53.972 --> 54:57.308
Ashes to ashes.
Dust to dust.

54:57.309 --> 54:58.810
God have mercy on his soul!

54:58.811 --> 55:01.088
The bloody bastards
have shot me in the ass!

55:01.088 --> 55:02.889
Take cover, men.

55:02.890 --> 55:05.392
If it's prayers he wants,
he can make up his own.

55:39.427 --> 55:41.262
<i>Oh, Jesus.</i>

55:41.262 --> 55:43.130
<i>I shouldn't have</i>
<i>been there at all.</i>

55:43.130 --> 55:44.598
<i>Or that poor</i>
<i>Bavarian, either.</i>

55:46.934 --> 55:48.502
<i>For all I know,</i>

55:48.503 --> 55:51.305
<i>we might have been friends.</i>

55:51.739 --> 55:53.173
<i>Instead of him dead,</i>

55:53.574 --> 55:55.484
<i>out there in the mud.</i>

55:55.485 --> 55:58.488
<i>And me, lying here like...</i>

55:58.488 --> 56:01.390
<i>like some freak</i>
<i>in a carnival show.</i>

56:04.043 --> 56:06.011
<i>Remember that time</i>
<i>in Los Angeles,</i>

56:06.012 --> 56:07.513
<i>when we all went</i>
<i>to the circus,</i>

56:07.513 --> 56:09.456
<i>and took Kareen</i>
<i>with us, too?</i>

56:09.457 --> 56:11.192
<i>And when we got home, the old man began</i>

56:11.192 --> 56:13.427
<i>imitating those</i>
<i>sideshow barkers?</i>

56:13.427 --> 56:15.762
<i>And the rest of us</i>
<i>joined in, too?</i>

56:17.198 --> 56:19.133
<i>He was a funny man!</i>

56:19.133 --> 56:22.069
<i>Just think what he</i>
<i>could have done with me,</i>

56:22.069 --> 56:23.503
<i>the way I am now.</i>

56:23.504 --> 56:26.707
<i>I eat...through a tube!</i>

56:27.041 --> 56:30.110
He breathes through a tube.

56:30.111 --> 56:32.613
And whatever goes in a tube

56:32.613 --> 56:34.623
has to come out
through a tube.

56:35.124 --> 56:38.627
He is the armless,
legless wonder

56:38.627 --> 56:40.629
of the 20th century!

56:40.629 --> 56:42.138
And yet, by God,

56:42.139 --> 56:44.141
he's just as alive
as you and me!

56:44.141 --> 56:48.145
He was a good boy.

56:48.379 --> 56:52.123
He was always forgetting things!

56:52.124 --> 56:54.201
And it's this
fellow right here!

56:54.201 --> 56:57.680
But he don't worry
about no shoes.

56:57.680 --> 56:58.981
'Cause he don't
need no shoes!

56:59.248 --> 57:01.316
He'd forget his overshoes.

57:01.317 --> 57:03.819
No shoes! No shirt!

57:03.819 --> 57:05.320
No socks!

57:05.321 --> 57:07.323
No gloves! No hat!

57:07.323 --> 57:09.325
He would forget his cap.

57:09.667 --> 57:11.235
No necktie!
No collar buttons!

57:11.236 --> 57:12.237
No vest! No coat!
No nothing!

57:12.745 --> 57:14.747
And now...

57:14.747 --> 57:18.751
he's forgotten...
just everything.

57:18.751 --> 57:21.754
All you gotta do
is drop a love offering

57:21.754 --> 57:25.335
of 15 cents or more
in this little lady's thunder mug.

57:25.612 --> 57:27.559
And I'll you
what I'm gonna do!

57:27.559 --> 57:30.261
I'm gonna lift the lid
of this box here,

57:30.262 --> 57:32.764
and I'm gonna let you
look at the face

57:32.765 --> 57:34.774
of the only man in the world

57:34.774 --> 57:38.277
who don't give a damn
about anything.

57:38.278 --> 57:40.280
And remember!

57:40.280 --> 57:42.790
It only cost ya 15 cents.

57:42.791 --> 57:44.800
And if this guy
looks back at you,

57:44.801 --> 57:46.302
by golly, I'll give ya
a five dollar bill.

57:48.137 --> 57:50.205
All right! Bring on
the music, Rollo Boy!

57:50.206 --> 57:51.707
Okay! Step right up!

57:52.208 --> 57:53.709
Step right up, folks!

57:53.710 --> 57:55.712
Step right up. Hurry,
hurry, hurry. hurry.

57:55.712 --> 57:57.246
Get a close look
at the man who can't--

57:57.747 --> 58:01.250
Thank you.
Or maybe he can!

58:01.251 --> 58:04.754
Thank you.

58:06.256 --> 58:07.757
Thank you.

58:09.759 --> 58:12.261
See that little lady?
Make her pot ring out

58:12.262 --> 58:14.264
like the bells of St. Mary!

58:14.764 --> 58:17.266
Glory, glory, glory!
Thank you, sir.

58:17.267 --> 58:19.269
Thank you.

58:19.769 --> 58:21.270
Thank you.

58:21.271 --> 58:22.772
Thank you!

58:25.775 --> 58:28.277
Thank you.

58:28.278 --> 58:30.647
Thank you.

58:34.450 --> 58:35.951
<i>Thank you.</i>

58:52.535 --> 58:54.537
<i>What's this?</i>

58:54.537 --> 58:56.972
<i>A different nurse?</i>

58:56.973 --> 58:58.975
<i>Why does she walk</i>
<i>without vibrations?</i>

58:58.975 --> 59:00.943
<i>Is she tip-toeing?</i>

59:01.444 --> 59:03.446
<i>Or-- Or is she just--</i>

59:03.446 --> 59:04.447
<i>little?</i>

01:00:04.941 --> 01:00:06.718
<i>Something fell on me.</i>

01:00:06.718 --> 01:00:08.119
<i>Something wet.</i>
<i>What was it?</i>

01:00:11.565 --> 01:00:13.066
<i>She must be new.</i>

01:00:13.067 --> 01:00:16.303
<i>She is new. Her hands</i>
<i>are soft, like Kareen's.</i>

01:00:16.737 --> 01:00:19.439
<i>She's a girl,</i>
<i>and I don't make her sick.</i>

01:00:19.440 --> 01:00:21.442
<i>She isn't afraid of me.</i>

01:00:21.442 --> 01:00:22.843
<i>Hello, new nurse.</i>

01:00:22.843 --> 01:00:24.277
<i>Hello, new beautiful</i>
<i>young nurse.</i>

01:00:25.279 --> 01:00:26.780
<i>Hello out there.</i>

01:00:29.250 --> 01:00:30.651
<i>Kareen.</i>

01:00:30.651 --> 01:00:33.587
<i>Oh, Kareen...</i>

01:00:33.587 --> 01:00:36.590
<i>where are you?</i>

01:00:36.590 --> 01:00:39.593
<i>We only made love</i>
<i>to each other one time</i>

01:00:39.593 --> 01:00:43.104
<i>in our--</i>
<i>in our whole lives.</i>

01:00:43.105 --> 01:00:46.608
<i>Joe-oe...</i>

01:00:51.079 --> 01:00:55.016
Joe-oe...

01:00:58.820 --> 01:01:02.766
Come out to the garden
in the pale moonlight!

01:01:05.078 --> 01:01:06.579
Is that you, Kareen?

01:01:06.579 --> 01:01:08.556
Hello, Joe.

01:01:08.557 --> 01:01:10.025
I had to get married.

01:01:10.025 --> 01:01:12.304
So now I'm somebody
else's Kareen.

01:01:12.304 --> 01:01:13.814
Then where's mine?

01:01:13.815 --> 01:01:15.216
In the pale moonlight,

01:01:15.216 --> 01:01:16.150
where she said she'd be.

01:01:53.421 --> 01:01:54.755
Kareen?

01:02:01.996 --> 01:02:04.840
Why did you bring me
to a place like this?

01:02:04.840 --> 01:02:06.308
I didn't.

01:02:06.308 --> 01:02:07.809
I heard you calling.

01:02:07.810 --> 01:02:10.813
I called,
and I called.

01:02:10.813 --> 01:02:13.315
And you never came.

01:02:13.315 --> 01:02:14.316
I was held up.

01:02:16.318 --> 01:02:17.819
How late am I?

01:02:17.820 --> 01:02:19.822
How long have I been away?

01:02:20.322 --> 01:02:21.823
I don't know.

01:02:21.824 --> 01:02:24.835
It may have been
forever, though.

01:02:24.835 --> 01:02:26.336
I can't remember.

01:02:26.337 --> 01:02:27.805
Well, try, Kareen.

01:02:27.805 --> 01:02:30.307
Please try.

01:02:30.307 --> 01:02:34.319
You see, I don't know
how long I've been here.

01:02:34.320 --> 01:02:35.321
I don't know
what year I'm in.

01:02:35.821 --> 01:02:38.123
And I'm trying
to get back into--

01:02:38.123 --> 01:02:40.058
into time.

01:02:40.059 --> 01:02:43.436
I don't pay much attention
to time any more.

01:02:43.437 --> 01:02:45.380
Oh, you must.

01:02:45.814 --> 01:02:47.148
All I think about is time.

01:02:47.148 --> 01:02:50.317
Time is what
makes people old.

01:02:50.318 --> 01:02:52.620
The way I am, Kareen,

01:02:53.121 --> 01:02:55.857
the way it is with me,
you'll never grow old.

01:02:55.857 --> 01:02:59.293
Because I keep you
right here in my mind.

01:02:59.294 --> 01:03:00.728
And in my heart.

01:03:00.729 --> 01:03:03.239
Just the way you were
when I saw you last.

01:03:04.707 --> 01:03:07.643
So you see, with me,
you can't get old.

01:03:07.644 --> 01:03:10.647
Your hair will always
stay brown.

01:03:10.647 --> 01:03:14.283
Your skin will always
be fresh like rain.

01:03:14.284 --> 01:03:18.463
I won't let one little
wrinkle mark your face.

01:03:18.464 --> 01:03:22.835
I'll keep you beside me,
young and beautiful forever.

01:03:22.835 --> 01:03:25.646
Because of all the people
in the world,

01:03:26.146 --> 01:03:30.350
only with me will you
be safe from time.

01:03:30.350 --> 01:03:33.186
Like a fresh, fresh flower.

01:03:34.566 --> 01:03:36.534
Like a rose--
I'm not! I'm not!

01:03:36.534 --> 01:03:38.369
Nobody loves me anymore!

01:03:38.370 --> 01:03:40.372
Oh, I do, Kareen.

01:03:55.787 --> 01:03:56.762
Stop that.
What happened to you?

01:03:58.272 --> 01:03:59.273
Don't even know
how to treat her.

01:03:59.273 --> 01:04:00.707
Then you got her pregnant,
went away,

01:04:00.708 --> 01:04:02.710
and stopped writing to her.

01:04:02.710 --> 01:04:05.612
I didn't know! I couldn't write!

01:04:05.613 --> 01:04:07.548
Bye, Joe.

01:04:09.483 --> 01:04:10.884
Goodbye.

01:04:19.894 --> 01:04:22.296
Goodbye, Joe!

01:04:22.296 --> 01:04:26.300
Kareen!
Goodbye, Joe...

01:04:33.274 --> 01:04:36.710
[Kareen
Don't let them take you, Joe...

01:04:36.711 --> 01:04:38.212
Run away!

01:04:39.647 --> 01:04:42.082
Goodbye, Joe...

01:04:42.583 --> 01:04:45.085
Can't you tell me
how long it's been?

01:04:45.086 --> 01:04:47.054
No...

01:04:49.523 --> 01:04:52.526
Can't you tell me
where I am?

01:04:52.526 --> 01:04:53.960
No...

01:05:00.334 --> 01:05:04.071
Can't you even tell me
what country I'm in?

01:05:04.071 --> 01:05:07.483
No country...

01:05:15.425 --> 01:05:16.926
<i>Well...</i>

01:05:16.926 --> 01:05:19.929
<i>I can feel them wheeling</i>
<i>my old bed out.</i>

01:05:19.929 --> 01:05:22.431
<i>And I am in a new one.</i>

01:05:22.432 --> 01:05:24.434
<i>With a pillow.</i>

01:05:24.434 --> 01:05:25.935
<i>What next?</i>

01:05:36.212 --> 01:05:38.214
<i>She's moving me.</i>

01:05:38.214 --> 01:05:40.716
<i>Yes.</i>

01:05:40.717 --> 01:05:42.719
<i>Ah, into the sunlight.</i>

01:05:55.198 --> 01:05:57.200
<i>Now she's in back of me.</i>

01:06:09.887 --> 01:06:11.897
<i>That tube.</i>

01:06:11.897 --> 01:06:14.399
<i>I never did</i>
<i>understand that one.</i>

01:06:16.878 --> 01:06:17.879
<i>Now my table.</i>

01:06:25.220 --> 01:06:26.221
<i>What else?</i>

01:07:07.136 --> 01:07:08.137
<i>Good.</i>

01:07:12.975 --> 01:07:13.909
<i>Good.</i>

01:07:19.882 --> 01:07:22.885
<i>I wonder if she's</i>
<i>an American.</i>

01:07:22.885 --> 01:07:24.795
<i>I hope so.</i>

01:07:24.796 --> 01:07:27.131
<i>I've only seen</i>
<i>one American girl</i>

01:07:27.132 --> 01:07:27.966
<i>since I left home.</i>

01:07:28.433 --> 01:07:31.736
I'm as American as apple pie.

01:07:34.606 --> 01:07:37.075
I was born
in San Francisco.

01:07:37.075 --> 01:07:38.852
Didn't I tell you?

01:07:38.852 --> 01:07:40.854
I was there when
the earthquake hit

01:07:40.854 --> 01:07:42.789
in 1906.

01:07:43.290 --> 01:07:46.259
Believe me,
that was a shake.

01:07:46.260 --> 01:07:48.737
I was up on the fourth floor

01:07:48.737 --> 01:07:50.138
of a hotel on Market Street,

01:07:50.138 --> 01:07:53.082
entertaining
a gentleman friend.

01:07:53.083 --> 01:07:55.518
And when I first
heard that thing hit,

01:07:55.519 --> 01:07:58.930
I said to myself,
I said, "Lucky," I said.

01:07:58.930 --> 01:08:01.440
"That's an earthquake.

01:08:01.441 --> 01:08:02.942
"And you ain't
gonna be caught dead

01:08:03.443 --> 01:08:06.646
with no fat son of a bitch
on top of ya like this."

01:08:08.448 --> 01:08:09.282
So you know what I did?

01:08:09.716 --> 01:08:10.725
Uh-uh.

01:08:11.125 --> 01:08:12.059
I pushed him off

01:08:12.060 --> 01:08:14.570
and ran stark naked
down the street.

01:08:14.571 --> 01:08:16.948
And you shoulda seen
the guys stare.

01:08:16.948 --> 01:08:18.950
I'll bet.

01:08:18.950 --> 01:08:19.884
Yeah.

01:08:26.291 --> 01:08:27.725
You aren't wanting
to do anything now,

01:08:27.725 --> 01:08:28.710
I guess, huh?

01:08:29.211 --> 01:08:30.212
Ah, too tired.

01:08:30.212 --> 01:08:32.214
That's what that French
cognac will do to ya.

01:08:32.214 --> 01:08:34.616
It'll be $2.00, just the same.

01:08:37.051 --> 01:08:38.553
Okay.

01:08:38.554 --> 01:08:40.022
What are you
knitting there?

01:08:40.022 --> 01:08:42.424
Sweater for my kid.

01:08:42.424 --> 01:08:46.269
He's only 5 years old.

01:08:46.270 --> 01:08:47.671
And the sweetest little
bastard you ever saw.

01:08:47.671 --> 01:08:49.625
Huh. Where is he?

01:08:49.625 --> 01:08:52.904
Oh, I keep him in
a school in Long Island.

01:08:53.404 --> 01:08:55.214
That's in New York.

01:08:55.215 --> 01:08:57.216
A private school.

01:08:57.216 --> 01:09:00.420
They got lots of
polo players there.

01:09:00.420 --> 01:09:03.656
And that's what I want him
to be when he grows up.

01:09:03.657 --> 01:09:05.625
Once you're a polo player,

01:09:05.626 --> 01:09:07.602
you meet all
the best people.

01:09:07.602 --> 01:09:09.103
Did you know that?

01:09:13.841 --> 01:09:15.243
You asleep?
No.

01:09:18.580 --> 01:09:21.049
Must have... cost you
a lot of money.

01:09:21.049 --> 01:09:22.450
A school like that.

01:09:22.450 --> 01:09:24.318
Oh, sure it does!

01:09:24.319 --> 01:09:26.821
But I don't do
too bad here.

01:09:26.821 --> 01:09:29.622
I make about
a hundred bucks a week.

01:09:31.593 --> 01:09:33.127
Of course...

01:09:33.127 --> 01:09:35.029
you got to dress up
to your position,

01:09:35.029 --> 01:09:36.930
and that takes money.

01:10:24.446 --> 01:10:25.380
<i>Kareen?</i>

01:10:27.348 --> 01:10:29.350
<i>Kareen...</i>

01:10:29.350 --> 01:10:31.352
<i>Oh, Kareen.</i>

01:12:30.972 --> 01:12:31.973
Hello, Bill.

01:12:31.973 --> 01:12:32.974
Hi, Mr. Bonham.

01:12:32.974 --> 01:12:33.983
Bill hasn't got a pole,

01:12:33.983 --> 01:12:35.918
and he's only here
for the afternoon.

01:12:35.918 --> 01:12:37.920
And I thought maybe
he could borrow yours.

01:12:37.920 --> 01:12:39.321
We could borrow yours.

01:12:39.322 --> 01:12:40.723
Oh.

01:12:42.158 --> 01:12:44.560
Uh...sure.

01:12:44.560 --> 01:12:46.061
Hey, but, uh--

01:12:46.062 --> 01:12:48.097
give Bill your pole,
and you take mine.

01:12:48.097 --> 01:12:49.531
Oh, sure.

01:12:53.803 --> 01:12:55.237
We'll be back
before dark.

01:12:55.238 --> 01:12:57.173
Thank you, Mr. Bonham.
Yeah.

01:13:04.180 --> 01:13:05.614
Hmm.

01:14:37.807 --> 01:14:39.249
Father.

01:14:42.519 --> 01:14:43.486
Yes?

01:14:46.890 --> 01:14:51.261
I lost your pole
today, Father.

01:14:51.261 --> 01:14:52.570
Got a quick strike,
and before we knew,

01:14:53.072 --> 01:14:55.774
your pole
was in the water.

01:14:55.774 --> 01:14:58.143
And, um-- we hunted
around for it,

01:14:58.143 --> 01:15:00.612
fished with the oars,
but--

01:15:01.013 --> 01:15:03.515
but we couldn't find it,
so it's gone.

01:15:26.839 --> 01:15:28.740
Well...

01:15:31.577 --> 01:15:34.021
Shouldn't let
a fishing pole...

01:15:35.422 --> 01:15:38.324
spoil our last trip
together, should we?

01:15:38.325 --> 01:15:39.292
No.

01:16:16.163 --> 01:16:18.999
I'll go on ahead. Catch us a ride into town.

01:16:21.001 --> 01:16:22.502
I won't be long.

01:16:36.483 --> 01:16:38.785
<i>Hello?</i>

01:16:38.786 --> 01:16:41.255
<i>Is it you?</i>

01:16:41.255 --> 01:16:42.731
<i>The one I love?</i>

01:16:45.734 --> 01:16:47.168
<i>Yes.</i>

01:16:57.312 --> 01:16:59.681
<i>What's this?</i>

01:16:59.682 --> 01:17:00.616
<i>What are you doing?</i>

01:17:04.887 --> 01:17:06.889
<i>One up. One down.</i>

01:17:06.889 --> 01:17:09.391
<i>One up. One down again.</i>

01:17:10.893 --> 01:17:12.370
<i>Oh, God, no.</i>

01:17:12.370 --> 01:17:14.805
<i>It can't be!</i>
<i>It can't!</i>

01:17:15.306 --> 01:17:17.315
<i>Are you talking to me</i>
<i>out there?</i>

01:17:17.316 --> 01:17:19.251
<i>Are you saying</i>
<i>something to me?</i>

01:17:19.752 --> 01:17:23.155
<i>Are you drawing a letter</i>
<i>on my skin, and then erasing it?</i>

01:17:23.155 --> 01:17:24.156
<i>A word?</i>

01:17:27.401 --> 01:17:29.578
<i>You are. You are.</i>
<i>You are! Yes, you are!</i>

01:17:29.578 --> 01:17:31.546
<i>It's a letter M!</i>

01:17:31.547 --> 01:17:33.982
<i>Yes. Oh, God bless you,</i>
<i>nurse! I got it! M!</i>

01:17:39.788 --> 01:17:41.122
<i>E.</i>

01:17:44.459 --> 01:17:45.927
<i>R.</i>

01:17:49.264 --> 01:17:51.266
<i>R.</i>

01:17:55.637 --> 01:17:57.138
<i>Y. Yes.</i>

01:17:57.139 --> 01:17:59.141
<i>Yes, of course</i>
<i>I've got it!</i>

01:17:59.141 --> 01:18:00.942
<i>Merry!</i>

01:18:01.109 --> 01:18:03.519
I'm trying to tell you.

01:18:03.520 --> 01:18:04.954
Merry Christmas.

01:18:05.489 --> 01:18:06.957
C.

01:18:11.395 --> 01:18:12.829
H.

01:18:17.768 --> 01:18:19.136
R.

01:18:20.904 --> 01:18:22.739
I.

01:18:26.076 --> 01:18:27.510
S.

01:18:30.013 --> 01:18:31.014
T.

01:18:46.697 --> 01:18:50.200
<i>Merry Christmas!</i>
<i>Merry Christmas!</i>

01:18:50.200 --> 01:18:53.102
<i>Oh, Merry Christmas!</i>
<i>Merry Christmas!</i>

01:18:53.103 --> 01:18:54.070
<i>Merry Christmas.</i>

01:18:56.406 --> 01:18:57.907
<i>Merry Christmas.</i>

01:18:59.910 --> 01:19:02.412
<i>Oh, God.</i>

01:19:02.412 --> 01:19:04.864
<i>I've got a date</i>
<i>to count from!</i>

01:19:04.865 --> 01:19:07.350
<i>By counting Christmases,</i>
<i>I can tell when it's spring!</i>

01:19:07.351 --> 01:19:09.328
<i>I can tell when it's summer!</i>

01:19:09.328 --> 01:19:11.697
<i>I can smell leaves</i>
<i>burning in autumn.</i>

01:19:14.066 --> 01:19:16.435
<i>Oh, Merry Christmas,</i>
<i>sweet nurse.</i>

01:19:16.435 --> 01:19:19.371
<i>Merry Christmas to you.</i>

01:19:19.371 --> 01:19:20.872
<i>Merry Christmas,</i>
<i>and all my love!</i>

01:19:20.873 --> 01:19:23.383
<i>Merry, Merry,</i>
<i>Merry Christmas.</i>

01:19:23.593 --> 01:19:25.661
Merry Christmas!

01:19:43.947 --> 01:19:46.449
I'm the boss.
This is champagne.

01:19:46.449 --> 01:19:48.451
Merry Christmas.

01:19:48.451 --> 01:19:50.961
I'm the boss.
This is champagne.

01:19:50.962 --> 01:19:51.963
Merry Christmas.

01:19:51.963 --> 01:19:53.898
I'm the boss.

01:19:53.898 --> 01:19:55.900
This is champagne.

01:19:55.900 --> 01:19:57.301
Merry Christmas.

01:19:57.302 --> 01:19:59.237
Where's my boy?
I'm the boss.

01:19:59.237 --> 01:20:01.239
Where's my little boy?
This is champagne.

01:20:01.239 --> 01:20:02.740
Merry Christmas.
He's too young.

01:20:02.740 --> 01:20:04.742
Can't you see--
I'm the boss.

01:20:04.742 --> 01:20:06.744
...he's underage?
This is champagne.

01:20:06.744 --> 01:20:09.246
Merry Christmas!
He just came up from Tucson.

01:20:09.247 --> 01:20:10.248
I'm the boss.

01:20:10.748 --> 01:20:12.257
This is champagne.
His name is--

01:20:12.759 --> 01:20:13.760
Merry Christmas.
...Jesus Christ.

01:20:13.760 --> 01:20:15.762
I'm the boss.
And today is

01:20:15.762 --> 01:20:16.763
his birthday.

01:20:16.763 --> 01:20:19.232
Merry Christmas.

01:20:19.232 --> 01:20:20.233
I'm the boss.

01:20:20.233 --> 01:20:22.235
This is champagne.

01:20:22.735 --> 01:20:24.737
Merry Christmas.

01:20:24.737 --> 01:20:26.238
I'm the boss.

01:20:26.239 --> 01:20:27.740
This is champagne.

01:20:27.740 --> 01:20:28.741
Merry Christmas.

01:20:28.741 --> 01:20:30.242
Might I cut in?

01:20:30.243 --> 01:20:31.744
Uh-uh.

01:20:31.744 --> 01:20:33.245
I have influence.

01:20:33.246 --> 01:20:36.249
Merry Christmas.
I can get you a soft berth.

01:20:36.249 --> 01:20:38.251
I can be
of great help.

01:20:38.251 --> 01:20:39.728
Merry Christmas.
I can help myself.

01:20:39.728 --> 01:20:41.204
That's what you think.

01:20:41.205 --> 01:20:43.207
But everything
has changed.

01:20:43.207 --> 01:20:46.210
The time has come
for you to go out

01:20:46.210 --> 01:20:47.611
and fight.

01:20:47.611 --> 01:20:49.512
Are you going
to fight, too?

01:20:49.513 --> 01:20:51.515
Merry Christmas.
I'm overaged. I can't.

01:20:51.515 --> 01:20:54.518
But somebody's
got to fight them.

01:20:54.518 --> 01:20:57.028
Merry Christmas.
We must have a just

01:20:57.028 --> 01:21:00.031
and lasting peace!

01:21:00.031 --> 01:21:02.041
Merry Christmas.
We've already got ours.

01:21:02.042 --> 01:21:03.043
Damn right.

01:21:03.043 --> 01:21:05.045
See these?
Two arms.

01:21:05.045 --> 01:21:06.546
Merry Christmas.
You see these?

01:21:06.546 --> 01:21:07.547
Two legs.

01:21:07.547 --> 01:21:09.048
You see this?

01:21:09.049 --> 01:21:10.550
One girl.

01:21:11.051 --> 01:21:13.028
Merry Christmas.
What else does anyone want?

01:21:13.028 --> 01:21:14.029
I'm the boss.

01:21:14.029 --> 01:21:15.030
This is champagne.
Liberty.

01:21:15.030 --> 01:21:16.031
And justice.

01:21:16.031 --> 01:21:18.033
Merry Christmas.
Liberty.

01:21:18.033 --> 01:21:19.034
And justice.

01:21:20.035 --> 01:21:21.536
Liberty.
I love you, Kareen.

01:21:21.537 --> 01:21:24.540
Merry Christmas.
You're so lucky, Joe. You are.

01:21:24.540 --> 01:21:25.516
You don't understand.

01:21:25.516 --> 01:21:27.518
I have to make
the world safe.

01:21:28.019 --> 01:21:29.520
This is champagne.

01:21:29.520 --> 01:21:31.455
Merry Christmas.

01:21:31.456 --> 01:21:32.457
I'm the boss.

01:21:32.457 --> 01:21:34.459
This is champagne.

01:21:34.459 --> 01:21:36.961
Merry Christmas.

01:21:36.961 --> 01:21:37.962
I'm the boss.
You're not my boy.

01:21:38.463 --> 01:21:39.464
This is champagne.

01:21:39.464 --> 01:21:40.465
Where's my boy?

01:21:40.465 --> 01:21:42.467
Merry Christmas.
Kareen?

01:21:42.467 --> 01:21:44.469
Where's
my little boy?

01:21:44.469 --> 01:21:45.470
Kareen?

01:21:45.470 --> 01:21:47.472
I'm the boss.

01:21:47.472 --> 01:21:48.973
This is champagne.

01:21:48.973 --> 01:21:51.842
Merry Christmas!

01:21:53.244 --> 01:21:55.187
Fellow workers.

01:21:56.689 --> 01:21:57.589
Ahem!

01:21:58.090 --> 01:21:59.524
Fellow workers?

01:22:01.427 --> 01:22:02.761
Fellow workers!

01:22:06.265 --> 01:22:08.767
Due to the war emergency,

01:22:08.768 --> 01:22:12.271
our little holiday will end
in just three more minutes.

01:22:12.271 --> 01:22:14.706
But the ovens are hot,

01:22:14.707 --> 01:22:16.875
and we must keep
the home fires burning.

01:22:18.177 --> 01:22:19.178
Let us sing.

01:22:22.648 --> 01:22:28.862

Father.

01:23:28.806 --> 01:23:29.814
Hello, son.

01:23:29.815 --> 01:23:30.782
Hello, Father.

01:23:31.283 --> 01:23:32.784
Want some honey?

01:23:32.784 --> 01:23:33.785
No, thanks.

01:23:33.785 --> 01:23:34.786
Sit down.

01:23:41.727 --> 01:23:43.228
Goodbye, Joe.

01:23:43.228 --> 01:23:45.129
Who was that girl?

01:23:47.966 --> 01:23:49.434
I really don't know.

01:23:50.936 --> 01:23:52.370
I was fishing.
She happened by.

01:23:52.871 --> 01:23:54.873
Wriggled
into my arms and stayed there.

01:23:56.308 --> 01:23:58.310
So many young girls
these days

01:23:58.310 --> 01:24:02.247
seem to be
hunting for a place in old men's arms.

01:24:02.247 --> 01:24:03.181
Pshew.

01:24:05.158 --> 01:24:06.659
Where did all
the young men go?

01:24:06.660 --> 01:24:08.094
They drift away.

01:24:09.596 --> 01:24:11.105
How is it with you,
Father?

01:24:11.106 --> 01:24:12.549
It's all right.

01:24:14.017 --> 01:24:15.952
You know,
it's a funny thing.

01:24:18.755 --> 01:24:20.757
I was a very good
shoe clerk.

01:24:20.757 --> 01:24:22.266
But I was
more than that.

01:24:22.267 --> 01:24:23.768
I could handle
a horse.

01:24:23.768 --> 01:24:24.769
If I had a cow,

01:24:24.769 --> 01:24:26.203
she was
always healthy,

01:24:26.204 --> 01:24:27.738
gave plenty of milk.

01:24:27.739 --> 01:24:30.241
Raised our own food
on two city lots.

01:24:31.743 --> 01:24:34.679
Even up to the honey
on our biscuits.

01:24:35.680 --> 01:24:38.149
I could, uh, hoe
a pretty good row...

01:24:39.484 --> 01:24:40.918
lay out
a pretty good grade

01:24:40.919 --> 01:24:43.421
on an uphill road.
Build a house.

01:24:45.432 --> 01:24:48.401
But I never did learn
how to make any money.

01:24:48.835 --> 01:24:51.771
The goddamndest thing
I ever ran into.

01:24:53.273 --> 01:24:54.707
See, the trouble
with life is

01:24:54.707 --> 01:24:56.208
you work so much,
you don't enjoy it.

01:24:56.209 --> 01:24:57.710
Yeah.

01:24:57.710 --> 01:24:58.711
Yeah.

01:25:02.182 --> 01:25:03.216
Better this way.

01:25:05.218 --> 01:25:05.718
Except...

01:25:07.728 --> 01:25:08.729
I do miss your mother.

01:25:13.178 --> 01:25:14.179
How is she?

01:25:14.179 --> 01:25:16.147
I haven't seen her lately.

01:25:16.148 --> 01:25:17.149
Oh.

01:25:18.150 --> 01:25:19.151
Well...

01:25:22.488 --> 01:25:24.423
not too long
till sunrise.

01:25:24.423 --> 01:25:25.924
Mmhh.

01:25:25.924 --> 01:25:27.358
I have to go.

01:25:29.361 --> 01:25:30.762
Trout'll be rising.

01:25:30.762 --> 01:25:32.563
Willow Lake.

01:25:32.564 --> 01:25:34.465
Now that I got
my pole back, I don't want to miss 'em.

01:25:37.970 --> 01:25:39.404
Goodbye, Father.

01:25:41.907 --> 01:25:43.884
Give my love
to your mother when you see her.

01:25:45.820 --> 01:25:47.729
Sorry I had to leave
you in the lurch,

01:25:47.730 --> 01:25:49.264
but it was
the only way, believe me.

01:25:50.733 --> 01:25:51.600
Goodbye.

01:26:21.430 --> 01:26:23.865
Joe.

01:26:23.866 --> 01:26:25.801
Joe.

01:26:25.801 --> 01:26:28.036
Here I am.

01:26:28.037 --> 01:26:29.938
No, Joe.
Over here.

01:26:31.440 --> 01:26:33.442
Let's play
blindman's bluff.

01:26:34.443 --> 01:26:35.444
Joe.

01:26:40.390 --> 01:26:42.291
Find me, Joe.

01:26:42.292 --> 01:26:44.702
Why did you
leave me, Joe?

01:26:45.704 --> 01:26:46.680
Run, Joe.

01:26:46.681 --> 01:26:49.417
Why didn't you
write me?

01:26:49.417 --> 01:26:50.718
I couldn't
write you!

01:26:50.718 --> 01:26:52.219
I just couldn't!

01:26:54.067 --> 01:26:55.034
Why couldn't you?

01:26:55.034 --> 01:26:56.468
I can't tell you!

01:26:56.469 --> 01:26:57.970
That's all!
I can't!

01:26:57.971 --> 01:27:00.807
You don't
love me, Joe.

01:27:05.612 --> 01:27:09.048
You don't love me.

01:27:09.048 --> 01:27:10.549
I do love you!

01:27:11.904 --> 01:27:12.943
I do love you!

01:27:12.944 --> 01:27:14.912
No, you don't, Joe.
You never did.

01:27:14.912 --> 01:27:16.914
Don't go, Kareen!

01:27:18.424 --> 01:27:19.825
Where are you?

01:27:19.825 --> 01:27:21.860
Olly olly
oxen free!

01:27:23.229 --> 01:27:24.697
Don't go away
from me again.

01:27:31.044 --> 01:27:32.512
Please.

01:27:33.447 --> 01:27:34.448
Don't.

01:27:39.887 --> 01:27:40.888
You need help, son.

01:27:43.891 --> 01:27:47.394
There isn't any help.

01:27:47.394 --> 01:27:50.397
Have you asked for any?

01:27:50.397 --> 01:27:51.898
I can't.

01:27:55.402 --> 01:27:57.404
I can't ask for anything.

01:27:57.905 --> 01:28:01.408
There is no way
I can talk to them.

01:28:01.408 --> 01:28:04.911
Then why don't you
send a telegram?

01:28:16.264 --> 01:28:18.774
A telegram?

01:28:18.775 --> 01:28:21.253
Don't you remember
when you were little?

01:28:21.253 --> 01:28:23.255
How you and Bill Harper
used to

01:28:23.255 --> 01:28:25.257
string a wire
between the two houses

01:28:25.257 --> 01:28:27.626
so you could telegraph
to each other?

01:28:29.161 --> 01:28:30.962
Yes.

01:28:37.603 --> 01:28:39.104
Still remember
the Morse code?

01:28:40.539 --> 01:28:42.040
Yes.

01:28:44.944 --> 01:28:47.980
What good is that?

01:28:47.980 --> 01:28:50.449
How can I type out
a message to them?

01:28:50.449 --> 01:28:52.918
You've got to learn to think.

01:28:52.918 --> 01:28:54.920
Use your head.

01:28:56.889 --> 01:28:59.224
Yes.

01:28:59.225 --> 01:29:02.161
Yes. My head.

01:29:04.096 --> 01:29:06.398
My head. My head, my head!

01:29:06.899 --> 01:29:08.600
Yes.

01:29:09.902 --> 01:29:13.405
<i>Yes. My head.</i>

01:29:13.405 --> 01:29:15.407
<i>My head.</i>

01:29:38.697 --> 01:29:40.699
<i>Where is she going?</i>

01:29:42.468 --> 01:29:45.504
Captain?
Yes?

01:29:45.504 --> 01:29:47.506
Could you come here
a minute, please?

01:29:47.506 --> 01:29:50.976
Yes, of course. Would you
take care of that, nurse? Thank you.

01:29:50.976 --> 01:29:52.978
<i>She's brought somebody in!</i>

01:30:00.920 --> 01:30:02.922
I can't understand
what he's doing.

01:30:04.390 --> 01:30:05.858
May I see
the orders, please?

01:30:05.858 --> 01:30:07.359
Yes.

01:30:08.861 --> 01:30:11.363
Thank you.

01:30:11.363 --> 01:30:13.698
Probably an early entry.

01:30:17.136 --> 01:30:18.570
"If bodily action
becomes violent

01:30:19.071 --> 01:30:20.906
or persistently repetitive"--

01:30:20.906 --> 01:30:23.884
These movements
are persistently repetitive.

01:30:23.884 --> 01:30:26.394
"They must be treated
as reflexive muscular spasms."

01:30:26.395 --> 01:30:28.897
Which is to say by sedation.

01:30:29.398 --> 01:30:31.400
Fair enough.
I'll prepare an injection.

01:30:33.402 --> 01:30:35.312
<i>Why is she trying to stop me?</i>

01:30:35.813 --> 01:30:38.816
I don't believe that
the movement is reflexive.

01:30:40.217 --> 01:30:42.185
Oh, you don't?

01:30:42.186 --> 01:30:45.055
Well, General Tillery
will pass through on the 23rd

01:30:45.055 --> 01:30:47.957
with his annual
staff inspection.

01:30:47.958 --> 01:30:49.392
If you don't trust me,
nurse,

01:30:49.393 --> 01:30:51.395
perhaps you'd better
take it up with him.

01:30:54.907 --> 01:30:56.408
I will.

01:30:56.408 --> 01:30:58.918
Well, that's excellent,
nurse.

01:30:58.919 --> 01:31:01.930
General Tillery is
the chief operating surgeon

01:31:01.931 --> 01:31:03.933
who wrote those orders.

01:31:05.368 --> 01:31:06.869
<i>No. No.</i>

01:31:07.370 --> 01:31:09.372
<i>Don't give me dope.</i>

01:31:09.372 --> 01:31:12.358
<i>Don't put me under again.</i>
Would you unlock the door, please?

01:31:12.358 --> 01:31:15.361
<i>I'm trying to talk to you.</i>

01:31:15.861 --> 01:31:19.364
<i>Oh, God, please</i>
<i>make them hear me.</i>

01:31:19.365 --> 01:31:22.735
<i>All I'm asking is for you</i>
<i>to take one little idea</i>

01:31:22.735 --> 01:31:26.150
<i>that's in my mind</i>
<i>and put it into their minds.</i>

01:31:26.150 --> 01:31:29.153
<i>Maybe only 2 or 3</i>
<i>feet away from me.</i>

01:31:29.153 --> 01:31:32.956
<i>It's-- It's such</i>
<i>a little thing to ask,</i>

01:31:32.957 --> 01:31:34.959
<i>but they won't listen.</i>

01:31:34.959 --> 01:31:36.961
<i>They won't hear me.</i>

01:31:36.961 --> 01:31:39.939
<i>All they do is give me dope,</i>

01:31:39.939 --> 01:31:42.274
<i>and I go down</i>

01:31:42.275 --> 01:31:44.777
<i>and down</i>

01:31:44.778 --> 01:31:46.279
<i>and...</i>

01:31:46.780 --> 01:31:48.281
<i>Oh, there you are, brothers.</i>

01:31:49.716 --> 01:31:52.719
<i>What were you hunting</i>
<i>when they caught you?</i>

01:31:52.719 --> 01:31:55.730
<i>Look, Father!</i>
<i>I found your fishing pole!</i>

01:31:57.699 --> 01:32:00.368
<i>Use your head, son.</i>

01:32:00.368 --> 01:32:03.204
<i>I am, Father. I am.</i>

01:32:04.472 --> 01:32:06.941
<i>Hear me.</i>

01:32:06.941 --> 01:32:11.312
<i>Please try to understand</i>
<i>what I'm doing and hear me!</i>

01:32:23.324 --> 01:32:25.326
<i>She did hear me!</i>

01:32:25.326 --> 01:32:27.227
<i>She's going</i>
<i>to get somebody!</i>

01:32:29.631 --> 01:32:31.833
<i>She didn't even</i>
<i>close the door!</i>

01:32:39.774 --> 01:32:42.143
<i>I've broken through.</i>

01:32:42.143 --> 01:32:45.146
<i>I'm back</i>
<i>with people again.</i>

01:32:45.146 --> 01:32:48.157
<i>Hello,</i>
<i>all you people out there.</i>

01:32:48.158 --> 01:32:52.137
<i>It's me, and we're going</i>
<i>to talk to each other.</i>

01:32:52.137 --> 01:32:54.639
<i>They're here. A lot of them.</i>

01:33:01.413 --> 01:33:02.814
It's Morse code.

01:33:02.815 --> 01:33:04.550
For what?

01:33:04.791 --> 01:33:08.161
SOS. Help.

01:33:12.065 --> 01:33:14.934
Do you mean to say
that this man

01:33:14.935 --> 01:33:18.271
is actually speaking to us?

01:33:18.271 --> 01:33:20.615
<i>What are they doing?</i>

01:33:20.616 --> 01:33:22.050
Yes, sir.

01:33:30.759 --> 01:33:32.694
Decerebrated, General?

01:33:33.662 --> 01:33:36.598
Completely decerebrated?

01:33:36.598 --> 01:33:38.533
<i>What are they waiting for?</i>

01:33:38.767 --> 01:33:39.768
<i>What's happening?</i>

01:33:49.111 --> 01:33:51.613
<i>Are they leaving?</i>

01:33:51.613 --> 01:33:53.114
<i>No.</i>

01:33:53.115 --> 01:33:55.617
<i>Just one of them.</i>

01:33:55.617 --> 01:33:57.561
<i>Or maybe two.</i>

01:33:57.562 --> 01:33:59.071
<i>No. Just one.</i>

01:34:04.943 --> 01:34:06.786
Ask what he wants.

01:34:06.786 --> 01:34:09.622
How can I ask a man like this
a question like that?

01:34:09.622 --> 01:34:13.525
By asking it.
How else can we help him?

01:34:14.461 --> 01:34:17.897
<i>Why don't they do something?</i>

01:34:20.233 --> 01:34:21.667
<i>They are.</i>
What...

01:34:24.471 --> 01:34:28.641
do...you...

01:34:30.877 --> 01:34:32.511
want?

01:34:34.322 --> 01:34:37.609
<i>What do I want?</i>

01:34:38.043 --> 01:34:39.611
<i>What do I want?</i>

01:34:41.246 --> 01:34:43.047
<i>What I want...</i>

01:34:45.058 --> 01:34:46.559
<i>I want out!</i>

01:34:46.935 --> 01:34:48.269
<i>I want to feel fresh air</i>
<i>against my skin.</i>

01:34:48.536 --> 01:34:50.838
<i>I want to feel people</i>
<i>around me.</i>

01:34:51.139 --> 01:34:53.040
<i>No.</i>

01:34:53.041 --> 01:34:54.042
<i>It would cost too much money</i>

01:34:54.542 --> 01:34:55.976
<i>taking care of me</i>
<i>on the outside.</i>

01:34:55.977 --> 01:34:57.745
<i>They never do that.</i>

01:34:57.746 --> 01:35:00.148
<i>But-- But maybe</i>
<i>there's a way</i>

01:35:00.148 --> 01:35:02.150
<i>I can take care of myself.</i>

01:35:03.652 --> 01:35:06.087
<i>Yes! There is a way!</i>

01:35:06.087 --> 01:35:08.097
<i>All you have to do</i>
<i>is put me on display</i>

01:35:08.098 --> 01:35:09.607
<i>and people</i>
<i>will pay to see me.</i>

01:35:09.607 --> 01:35:11.617
<i>Lots of people.</i>
<i>Put me in a fancy coffin</i>

01:35:12.118 --> 01:35:13.986
<i>with windows in it,</i>
<i>and take me out where people</i>

01:35:13.986 --> 01:35:15.887
<i>are spending money</i>
<i>and having fun.</i>

01:35:15.888 --> 01:35:17.890
<i>Take me to the beaches</i>
<i>and the county fairs</i>

01:35:17.890 --> 01:35:18.891
<i>and the 4th of July</i>
<i>celebrations</i>

01:35:18.891 --> 01:35:20.893
<i>and all the church bazaars.</i>

01:35:20.893 --> 01:35:22.828
<i>They've seen</i>
<i>the pin-headed girl from Timbuktu</i>

01:35:22.828 --> 01:35:23.829
<i>or the dog-faced man</i>

01:35:23.829 --> 01:35:25.330
<i>who crawls on his belly</i>
<i>like a reptile.</i>

01:35:25.331 --> 01:35:27.308
<i>But they're not real freaks.</i>
<i>They were born that way.</i>

01:35:27.308 --> 01:35:29.310
<i>They were made</i>
<i>that way by God.</i>

01:35:29.310 --> 01:35:31.312
<i>But this thing here</i>
<i>in his fancy coffin</i>

01:35:31.312 --> 01:35:33.247
<i>was made by people--</i>

01:35:33.248 --> 01:35:35.250
<i>by you and me</i>
<i>and the lady next door--</i>

01:35:35.250 --> 01:35:36.684
<i>and that takes</i>
<i>a lot of planning</i>

01:35:36.684 --> 01:35:38.085
<i>and costs a lot of money.</i>

01:35:38.086 --> 01:35:40.096
<i>Advertise me as the only</i>
<i>piece of meat in the world</i>

01:35:40.597 --> 01:35:42.098
<i>that can talk through</i>
<i>the back of its head.</i>

01:35:42.098 --> 01:35:44.508
<i>And if that</i>
<i>doesn't pull them in, then-- then-- then--</i>

01:35:45.043 --> 01:35:47.045
<i>then bill me as the last man</i>
<i>on earth who joined the Army.</i>

01:35:47.045 --> 01:35:49.047
<i>Because the army makes men.</i>

01:35:49.047 --> 01:35:50.524
<i>So rally around</i>
<i>the flag, boys--</i>

01:35:50.524 --> 01:35:52.526
<i>your flag, their flag,</i>
<i>anybody's flag--</i>

01:35:52.526 --> 01:35:53.460
<i>because the flag</i>
<i>needs soldiers,</i>

01:35:53.460 --> 01:35:56.379
<i>and the army makes men.</i>

01:35:56.380 --> 01:36:01.359
I...want...out...

01:36:01.627 --> 01:36:04.563
so...people...

01:36:05.064 --> 01:36:08.320
can...see...

01:36:08.320 --> 01:36:11.089
what...I am.

01:36:11.089 --> 01:36:15.326
Put me...in...

01:36:15.327 --> 01:36:18.563
a...

01:36:18.563 --> 01:36:22.466
c-carnival...show

01:36:22.467 --> 01:36:26.437
where they...can

01:36:26.438 --> 01:36:28.907
look...at me.

01:36:28.907 --> 01:36:31.943
Let...me out.

01:36:31.943 --> 01:36:35.880
Well, what could we
have expected?

01:36:36.882 --> 01:36:39.317
Tell him, uh...

01:36:39.317 --> 01:36:41.252
Tell him we'll do
everything we can,

01:36:41.253 --> 01:36:44.022
but, uh, his condition
won't permit him to be moved.

01:36:44.322 --> 01:36:45.723
For the present, that is.

01:36:46.191 --> 01:36:48.927
Be sure to say
"for the present."

01:36:57.903 --> 01:36:59.271
If...

01:37:00.839 --> 01:37:01.781
you...

01:37:04.117 --> 01:37:07.887
won't...let...

01:37:08.154 --> 01:37:10.990
people see me,

01:37:11.157 --> 01:37:12.625
then...

01:37:14.627 --> 01:37:15.928
kill me.

01:37:29.842 --> 01:37:32.711
He's upset.
Understandably so.

01:37:33.212 --> 01:37:34.713
Ask him what his name is.

01:37:54.233 --> 01:37:57.455
These shutters are to be closed
at all times.

01:37:57.456 --> 01:37:59.458
What's he saying?

01:37:59.892 --> 01:38:02.361
He says, "Kill me."

01:38:02.361 --> 01:38:04.696
Over and over again.
"Kill me."

01:38:08.434 --> 01:38:11.746
Tell him we'll do everything we can to make him comfortable.

01:38:11.746 --> 01:38:13.214
For now, he needs rest.

01:38:13.214 --> 01:38:16.091
Tell him we'll give him
a sedative and come back later.

01:38:16.092 --> 01:38:18.035
And try to get his name.

01:38:20.004 --> 01:38:22.873
You're not to mention
what has happened here to anyone.

01:38:22.873 --> 01:38:25.775
I'll hold you collectively
responsible for any breach.

01:38:25.776 --> 01:38:28.712
If new orders are received
in view of the new situation which has developed,

01:38:28.712 --> 01:38:30.714
you'll be notified.

01:38:31.215 --> 01:38:32.223
Well?

01:38:34.159 --> 01:38:36.961
He won't wait
for an answer.

01:38:36.962 --> 01:38:39.898
All he says is

01:38:39.898 --> 01:38:44.177
"Kill me, kill me, kill me."

01:38:46.555 --> 01:38:49.491
Don't you have some message
for him, Padre?

01:38:51.927 --> 01:38:52.827
You could at least tell him

01:38:52.828 --> 01:38:54.462
to put his faith in God,
couldn't you?

01:38:55.831 --> 01:38:58.308
I'll pray for him
for the rest of my days,

01:38:58.808 --> 01:39:01.110
but I will not risk
testing his faith

01:39:01.111 --> 01:39:02.912
against your stupidity.

01:39:07.384 --> 01:39:09.352
Well, you're a hell
of a priest, aren't you?

01:39:09.819 --> 01:39:12.788
He's the product
of your profession,

01:39:12.789 --> 01:39:15.091
not mine.

01:39:17.060 --> 01:39:19.128
Clear the room.

01:39:19.129 --> 01:39:21.631
Give him a light sedative,
nurse.

01:39:23.133 --> 01:39:25.635
<i>They're going away. Why?</i>

01:39:25.635 --> 01:39:27.536
<i>Why don't they get it</i>
<i>over with and kill me?</i>

01:39:28.938 --> 01:39:31.240
<i>But you're still here.</i>

01:39:31.241 --> 01:39:33.743
<i>Can't you see</i>
<i>what I'm tapping to you?</i>

01:39:33.743 --> 01:39:36.746
<i>I'm asking you to kill me.</i>

01:39:36.746 --> 01:39:38.748
<i>Please do.</i>

01:40:02.138 --> 01:40:03.973
O my God,

01:40:04.908 --> 01:40:07.243
I'm heartily sorry

01:40:07.243 --> 01:40:09.645
for having offended thee.

01:40:11.047 --> 01:40:13.949
And I detest all my sins,

01:40:13.950 --> 01:40:16.285
not because of Thy judgment,
O Lord,

01:40:16.286 --> 01:40:18.988
but because
thou art all good

01:40:18.988 --> 01:40:22.124
and deserving
of all my love.

01:40:29.098 --> 01:40:31.100
I firmly resolve,

01:40:31.100 --> 01:40:34.336
with the help of thy grace,

01:40:34.337 --> 01:40:37.606
to sin no more, to avoid
all the occasions of sin.

01:40:40.510 --> 01:40:41.944
Amen.

01:40:49.027 --> 01:40:50.995
<i>Oh, nurse--</i>

01:40:50.995 --> 01:40:54.974
<i>beautiful,</i>
<i>beautiful nurse--</i>

01:40:54.975 --> 01:40:56.876
<i>thank you,</i>

01:40:56.877 --> 01:41:00.221
<i>thank you, thank you.</i>

01:41:00.221 --> 01:41:02.223
<i>Dear God,</i>
<i>thank her for me.</i>

01:41:02.223 --> 01:41:04.191
<i>Be sweet to her, God.</i>

01:41:04.192 --> 01:41:06.621
<i>Make her happy.</i>
<i>Make her beautiful.</i>

01:41:06.622 --> 01:41:09.157
<i>Make everything she wants</i>
<i>come true!</i>

01:41:09.658 --> 01:41:11.159
<i>Make everyone love her!</i>

01:41:13.162 --> 01:41:14.663
No!

01:41:16.165 --> 01:41:17.642
No.

01:41:17.642 --> 01:41:18.643
Leave the room.

01:41:18.643 --> 01:41:22.813
<i>Oh, somebody stopped her.</i>

01:41:22.814 --> 01:41:25.057
<i>Why?</i>

01:41:25.058 --> 01:41:28.670
I said,
"Leave the room."

01:41:29.171 --> 01:41:30.906
Give me the key.

01:41:30.906 --> 01:41:33.375
<i>What's happening?</i>

01:41:33.375 --> 01:41:35.243
The key?

01:41:38.647 --> 01:41:40.148
Go on.

01:41:42.084 --> 01:41:44.562
<i>She's going.</i>

01:41:44.562 --> 01:41:47.197
<i>I can feel her</i>
<i>moving toward the door.</i>

01:41:47.198 --> 01:41:50.067
<i>He's sending her away.</i>

01:41:50.067 --> 01:41:52.002
<i>Why?</i>

01:41:52.003 --> 01:41:53.904
<i>First they</i>
<i>close the shutters,</i>

01:41:53.904 --> 01:41:57.883
<i>and now they're</i>
<i>sending her away.</i>

01:41:57.884 --> 01:42:00.353
<i>Why did they</i>
<i>close the shutters?</i>

01:42:02.589 --> 01:42:05.091
<i>Why is he</i>
<i>sending her away?</i>

01:42:06.593 --> 01:42:09.529
<i>Why won't they</i>
<i>let me talk?</i>

01:42:09.929 --> 01:42:13.432
<i>Because I'm a secret</i>
<i>or something?</i>

01:42:13.433 --> 01:42:15.435
<i>Oh, I don't know.</i>

01:42:16.870 --> 01:42:18.805
<i>She's gone.</i>

01:42:20.306 --> 01:42:22.308
<i>Good-bye, nurse.</i>

01:42:23.818 --> 01:42:26.320
<i>You're gone,</i>

01:42:26.320 --> 01:42:28.322
<i>and I'm a secret.</i>

01:42:29.824 --> 01:42:31.826
<i>Oh, no. Not that again.</i>

01:42:35.830 --> 01:42:39.275
<i>I-- I thought</i>
<i>they'd be glad</i>

01:42:39.275 --> 01:42:42.211
<i>that I found a way to--</i>

01:42:42.211 --> 01:42:44.213
<i>to talk to them.</i>

01:42:45.214 --> 01:42:47.216
<i>But they're not.</i>

01:42:50.720 --> 01:42:53.723
<i>The only thing on this earth</i>
<i>I'm any good for</i>

01:42:55.157 --> 01:42:57.692
<i>they won't let me do.</i>

01:42:58.194 --> 01:42:59.195
<i>All they want is to push me</i>

01:42:59.195 --> 01:43:03.199
<i>back into the darkness</i>
<i>down here</i>

01:43:03.199 --> 01:43:06.068
<i>so they won't ever</i>
<i>see me again.</i>

01:43:07.479 --> 01:43:10.915
<i>He's gone, too.</i>

01:43:10.916 --> 01:43:14.219
<i>Well, now I know.</i>

01:43:14.219 --> 01:43:16.154
<i>They'll never let me out.</i>

01:43:18.089 --> 01:43:21.459
<i>They'll keep me a secret here</i>
<i>until someday,</i>

01:43:21.459 --> 01:43:24.328
<i>when I'm an old, old man,</i>

01:43:24.329 --> 01:43:27.231
<i>I'll sneak away</i>
<i>from them and die.</i>

01:43:29.734 --> 01:43:31.235
<i>It isn't easy, though.</i>

01:43:32.579 --> 01:43:37.383
<i>Inside me,</i>
<i>I'm screaming and yelling</i>

01:43:37.383 --> 01:43:39.752
<i>and howling</i>
<i>like a trapped animal...</i>

01:43:41.221 --> 01:43:44.557
<i>and nobody</i>
<i>pays any attention.</i>

01:43:44.557 --> 01:43:47.459
<i>If I had arms,</i>
<i>I could kill myself.</i>

01:43:48.895 --> 01:43:51.764
<i>If I had legs,</i>
<i>I could run away.</i>

01:43:51.764 --> 01:43:53.599
<i>If I had a voice,</i>

01:43:53.600 --> 01:43:57.270
<i>I could talk and be some</i>
<i>kind of company for myself.</i>

01:43:57.704 --> 01:43:59.605
<i>I could yell for help.</i>

01:44:00.607 --> 01:44:03.384
<i>But nobody'd help me.</i>

01:44:03.384 --> 01:44:06.253
<i>Not even God,</i>
<i>because there isn't any God.</i>

01:44:06.254 --> 01:44:08.656
<i>Couldn't be</i>
<i>in a place like this.</i>

01:44:09.991 --> 01:44:11.792
<i>And, uh...</i>

01:44:13.661 --> 01:44:16.030
<i>And yet,</i>

01:44:16.030 --> 01:44:19.500
<i>I've just got</i>
<i>to do something</i>

01:44:21.836 --> 01:44:24.772
<i>because I--</i>

01:44:25.707 --> 01:44:28.009
<i>I don't see how I can</i>

01:44:28.009 --> 01:44:30.478
<i>go on like this</i>

01:44:30.478 --> 01:44:32.813
<i>much longer.</i>

01:44:35.216 --> 01:44:38.994
<i>SOS.</i>

01:44:38.995 --> 01:44:42.506
<i>Help me.</i>

01:44:42.507 --> 01:44:46.410
<i>SOS.</i>

01:44:46.411 --> 01:44:49.814
<i>Help me.</i>

01:44:49.814 --> 01:44:53.751
<i>SOS.</i>

01:44:53.752 --> 01:44:57.255
<i>Help me.</i>

01:44:57.255 --> 01:45:00.758
<i>SOS.</i>

01:45:01.259 --> 01:45:04.762
<i>Help me.</i>

01:45:04.763 --> 01:45:08.767
<i>SOS.</i>

01:45:08.767 --> 01:45:12.270
<i>Help me.</i>

01:45:12.771 --> 01:45:15.774
<i>SOS.</i>

01:45:16.274 --> 01:45:19.777
<i>Help me.</i>

01:45:19.778 --> 01:45:24.015
<i>SOS.</i>

01:45:24.015 --> 01:45:26.517
<i>Help me.</i>

01:45:27.519 --> 01:45:31.523
<i>SOS.</i>

01:45:31.523 --> 01:45:34.526
