WEBVTT

00:00.400 --> 00:01.400
i'm hank.

00:01.500 --> 00:05.300
i was your typical emergency
room doctor until i got fired.

00:05.400 --> 00:07.400
you let a billionaire
hospital trustee die

00:07.500 --> 00:08.600
to save some kid off the street.

00:08.700 --> 00:10.800
- i made a judgment call.
- you made a mistake.

00:10.900 --> 00:11.700
this is my brother.

00:11.800 --> 00:13.500
i'm evan r. lawson, c.p.a.

00:13.600 --> 00:17.000
he took me away from my
troubles and to the hamptons.

00:17.400 --> 00:20.900
and suddenly, i had a chance to
become a whole new kind of doctor.

00:21.000 --> 00:23.100
it turns out the wealthy
and not so wealthy out here

00:23.200 --> 00:25.500
could use a guy
who makes house calls.

00:25.700 --> 00:29.500
so i got a second chance
to do what i do best.

00:31.000 --> 00:37.074

00:42.700 --> 00:44.000
wha...

00:45.000 --> 00:45.800
can i help you?

00:45.900 --> 00:47.400
it's an abomination,
what you're doing.

00:47.500 --> 00:49.000
you can't separate
an egg from a yolk.

00:49.100 --> 00:51.400
it's like separating
the earth from the moon

00:51.500 --> 00:53.300
or thunder from lightning
or hall from oates.

00:53.400 --> 00:54.900
you just compared daryl
hall to the earth.

00:55.000 --> 00:56.100
what do you know
about taste?

00:56.200 --> 00:58.100
and egg whites happen to be
loaded with protein,

00:58.200 --> 00:59.800
low in calories,
have no fat, and--

00:59.900 --> 01:01.100
taste like it.

01:01.500 --> 01:02.500
- oh.
- what are you do--

01:02.600 --> 01:03.800
in the bowl, hank.

01:03.900 --> 01:05.200
the goal is to get the egg
in the bowl.

01:05.300 --> 01:06.700
look, i spent years at a job

01:06.800 --> 01:08.700
where i had to scrub in and out
countless times a day.

01:08.800 --> 01:10.800
i'm messy at home
because i can be.

01:10.900 --> 01:11.800
- oh...
- look, i'll clean up.

01:11.900 --> 01:13.600
oh, really, you'll clean up
like you clean up your clothes

01:13.700 --> 01:15.000
or the towel
on the bathroom floor?

01:15.100 --> 01:15.800
who are you?

01:15.900 --> 01:16.900
all i'm saying is,
it's been really great

01:17.000 --> 01:18.000
living with you again,
you know.

01:18.100 --> 01:20.500
it's like old times--
sharing a place with my big brother

01:20.500 --> 01:21.300
and the bonding and everything--

01:21.300 --> 01:22.200
wait for it, here it comes.

01:22.300 --> 01:25.500
but you are the biggest slob
i've ever met in my life.

01:25.600 --> 01:27.000
so i make a mess. i clean it up.

01:27.100 --> 01:28.500
no, you make a mess
and i clean it up.

01:28.600 --> 01:30.100
what does it matter?
it's our home.

01:30.200 --> 01:32.800
it matters because
"a," you're a slob, and "b,"

01:33.100 --> 01:34.600
it's not just our home,

01:34.700 --> 01:36.200
but it's also gonna be
our office.

01:36.300 --> 01:37.500
hankmed's workstation.

01:37.800 --> 01:39.000
check it out,
i made a blueprint.

01:39.100 --> 01:40.800
okay, so i've divided
the space into quadrants.

01:40.800 --> 01:41.900
- quadrants?
- it's four parts.

01:42.000 --> 01:42.700
i know what a quadrant is.

01:42.800 --> 01:43.900
work environment in quadrant one.

01:44.000 --> 01:45.100
sleeping quarters in quadrant two.

01:45.100 --> 01:46.600
- stop saying quadrant.
- wet bar in quad--

01:46.600 --> 01:47.800
wet bar over here.

01:47.900 --> 01:48.900
- wet bar?
- yeah, wet bar.

01:49.000 --> 01:50.300
that's pretty cool, right?
it's what people do out here.

01:50.400 --> 01:53.100
- what, get soused?
- yeah, basically.

01:56.200 --> 01:57.100
you gonna get that?

01:57.200 --> 01:58.200
i...

01:58.700 --> 02:00.900
ah, ah, ah.
work before food.

02:02.300 --> 02:03.800
this is hank.

02:03.900 --> 02:06.000
hi. of course.

02:06.100 --> 02:08.199
just text me the address.
okay.

02:08.300 --> 02:09.600
- eh?
- i just...

02:09.699 --> 02:12.400
no. no.

02:13.900 --> 02:15.700
have fun.

02:28.400 --> 02:30.000
- hey.
- hey.

02:30.100 --> 02:30.900
everything okay?

02:30.900 --> 02:32.200
yeah. follow me.

02:32.300 --> 02:33.400
sure. what's up?

02:33.500 --> 02:34.800
good morning.

02:34.900 --> 02:37.100
just play along.

02:37.700 --> 02:40.300
dr. lawson.
sheila montgomery.

02:40.300 --> 02:42.300
- so glad you could make it.
- me too.

02:42.300 --> 02:43.600
from what jill tells me,

02:43.600 --> 02:46.500
you and this turn-key,
center hall modern colonial

02:46.600 --> 02:47.700
are made for each other.

02:47.700 --> 02:50.700
i had no idea you were so familiar
with my architectural leanings.

02:50.800 --> 02:52.600
i surprise people.

02:52.700 --> 02:56.100
dr. lawson, allow me
to show you the great room.

02:56.200 --> 02:58.200
i-i don't want
to waste your time,

02:58.300 --> 02:59.300
but, uh...what?

02:59.400 --> 03:02.900
i'm not really
a big great room man.

03:03.200 --> 03:04.700
but...

03:04.800 --> 03:08.600
this, however, is
truly a great great room.

03:08.600 --> 03:09.400
one of the greatest.

03:09.500 --> 03:11.500
and it's really, uh, great.

03:11.600 --> 03:12.400
sorry to pry.

03:12.500 --> 03:14.400
i couldn't help, um,
but notice.

03:14.500 --> 03:15.400
what did you do
to your arm?

03:15.500 --> 03:18.600
oh, uh, burned myself
taking cookies out of the oven.

03:18.700 --> 03:20.200
occupational hazard.

03:20.300 --> 03:21.800
it's a little realtor trick.

03:21.900 --> 03:24.100
before you show a place,
bake fresh cookies.

03:24.200 --> 03:26.000
it makes a house
smell like a home.

03:26.100 --> 03:29.500
oh, well, that explains my sudden
craving for a glass of milk.

03:29.600 --> 03:31.300
did you see a doctor
about that?

03:31.300 --> 03:33.500
oh, don't worry, hank.
sheila's on top of it.

03:33.600 --> 03:35.000
she has to be
as a diabetic.

03:35.100 --> 03:36.200
diabetic?

03:36.300 --> 03:38.300
uh, you really should
see your doctor.

03:38.400 --> 03:39.300
get that looked at.

03:39.400 --> 03:41.900
i will. i just have a full
day of potential renters.

03:42.000 --> 03:43.500
if you leave that wound untreated,

03:43.500 --> 03:44.900
it could get very serious.

03:45.000 --> 03:47.000
you are absolutely right.

03:47.300 --> 03:48.800
let me show you
the master bedroom.

03:48.900 --> 03:50.100
little doctor trick.

03:50.200 --> 03:53.400
when you're a doctor with a busy
diabeticwho has an untreated burn,

03:53.400 --> 03:55.000
you treat it.

03:55.100 --> 03:58.100
i want you to shower
the wound, using soap,

03:58.600 --> 03:59.600
three to four times a day.

03:59.600 --> 04:01.600
make sure you pat it dry

04:01.700 --> 04:03.800
and cover it
with a clean bandage.

04:03.900 --> 04:06.000
if it starts looking red or pus-y,

04:06.100 --> 04:07.500
i want you to call me
immediately.

04:07.600 --> 04:09.000
and watch your sugars,
okay?

04:09.100 --> 04:10.200
thanks.

04:10.300 --> 04:12.200
are you sure you don't want
to see the basement?

04:12.300 --> 04:13.500
it was just renovated.

04:13.600 --> 04:15.800
- hank has to get back to work.
- yes, i do.

04:15.900 --> 04:18.399
then promise me you'll come back
and see the house at sunset.

04:18.500 --> 04:21.200
- oh, i don't-- it is?
- it's magical then.

04:21.300 --> 04:22.900
key's under the mat.

04:23.000 --> 04:24.300
bring a bottle of wine.

04:24.300 --> 04:27.600
i guarantee it's the most
romantic view in the hamptons.

04:27.700 --> 04:29.600
how can i say no to that?

04:30.300 --> 04:31.800
why did i say yes to that?

04:31.900 --> 04:33.300
because you are a good guy.

04:33.900 --> 04:35.400
and who is she again?

04:35.500 --> 04:36.600
sheila's a neighbor.

04:36.700 --> 04:38.000
her cobra coverage ran out,

04:38.100 --> 04:40.800
and i offered to help,
but she's too proud.

04:41.000 --> 04:42.000
thanks for coming.

04:42.100 --> 04:44.900
and, uh, being so cool.

04:45.000 --> 04:46.100
- cool?
- mm-hmm.

04:46.200 --> 04:49.100
oh, that's me, you know.
mister cool.

04:49.500 --> 04:51.500
no, no, look.
i'm happy to do it.

04:51.500 --> 04:52.800
just give me a little
warning next time.

04:52.900 --> 04:55.100
my playing along skills
are still coming along.

04:55.200 --> 04:57.600
well, hopefully,
there won't be a next time.

04:57.700 --> 04:59.600
i'm sending letters
to all the patients

04:59.700 --> 05:00.900
who've been frozen
out of the hospital

05:01.000 --> 05:03.300
letting them know
that the hamptons free clinic

05:03.400 --> 05:05.300
is on schedule to open in the fall.

05:05.400 --> 05:07.900
- congratulations.
- yeah, thank you.

05:08.400 --> 05:13.200
for some reason, i find myself
craving chocolate chip cookies.

05:13.400 --> 05:14.400
you wanna grab a bite to eat?

05:14.500 --> 05:16.300
i only have 30 minutes
till my next meeting.

05:16.400 --> 05:18.100
we'll take big bites.

05:20.600 --> 05:22.100
hey, divya.

05:22.600 --> 05:24.200
what time is it?

05:24.400 --> 05:25.900
okay, okay.

05:26.600 --> 05:28.000
rain check?

05:28.400 --> 05:30.000
we'll see.

05:31.300 --> 05:32.800
we'll see.

05:39.400 --> 05:41.100
hey, guys.

05:41.800 --> 05:43.000
sorry i'm late.

05:43.300 --> 05:46.000
wow, rule number one
of concierge doctoring, hank:

05:46.100 --> 05:47.800
you don't keep the
rich people waiting.

05:47.900 --> 05:48.600
good to know.

05:48.700 --> 05:50.500
yeah, actually,
come to think of it,

05:50.700 --> 05:52.200
concierge doctors in the hamptons,

05:52.300 --> 05:54.700
by definition,
are required to be arrogant,

05:54.700 --> 05:57.600
boring, and quick to scope out
libby when she's in a bikini.

05:57.700 --> 05:59.100
cut me some slack,
i'm new at this.

05:59.200 --> 06:00.500
but also good to know.

06:00.600 --> 06:02.600
you seem to lack
all of those qualities.

06:02.700 --> 06:04.600
wow, thank you guys so much.

06:04.700 --> 06:06.600
okay, shall we
remove the sutures?

06:06.700 --> 06:07.500
yes.

06:07.600 --> 06:10.000
uh, should we just
do it out here?

06:10.100 --> 06:11.500
i don't see why not.

06:11.500 --> 06:15.300
this will be my first
suture extraction poolside.

06:16.300 --> 06:18.000
huh, the surgeon id nice work.

06:18.100 --> 06:19.100
he was under a lot of pressure.

06:19.200 --> 06:20.900
why, was your father
standing over him?

06:21.000 --> 06:22.700
no, i was.

06:22.800 --> 06:24.900
imagine being
mozart's piano tuner,

06:25.000 --> 06:26.400
but then more stressful
than that.

06:26.400 --> 06:28.100
i guess your dad
didn't visit?

06:28.500 --> 06:30.000
right. busy man.

06:30.100 --> 06:31.800
we're all busy, hank.

06:32.100 --> 06:34.300
all right, you may feel
a little pull.

06:34.400 --> 06:35.900
i'll live.

06:36.200 --> 06:37.000
tucker.

06:37.100 --> 06:39.900
we never received your father's
signed form of consent.

06:39.900 --> 06:41.100
i'd be happy to forge one.

06:41.100 --> 06:43.600
you really should see his
forgeries. they are works of art.

06:43.600 --> 06:45.200
yeah, you know what?
how about we get an original?

06:45.300 --> 06:47.100
yeah, just as soon
as dad gets back.

06:47.200 --> 06:49.300
oh, there's a retirement party
this afternoon

06:49.400 --> 06:50.600
mr. bryant is invited to,

06:50.600 --> 06:52.900
and tucker has
to represent the family.

06:53.000 --> 06:53.800
you guys wanna come?

06:53.900 --> 06:55.900
retirement party?
sounds like a can't-miss.

06:56.000 --> 06:58.100
unfortunately, i'll miss it.

06:58.400 --> 06:59.900
okay, you're all done.

07:00.000 --> 07:01.900
hank, it might be a
good thing for us to go.

07:01.900 --> 07:04.300
in what way would it be good for
us to go to a retirement party?

07:04.300 --> 07:05.900
come on, hank.
old people?

07:06.000 --> 07:07.900
high incomes,
higher blood pressure.

07:07.900 --> 07:08.900
it's your prime demo.

07:09.000 --> 07:10.800
hank, the kid's right.

07:12.800 --> 07:14.800
who's the retiree?

07:23.300 --> 07:34.400
<font color="#ffff00">www.1000fr.com presents</font>

07:34.400 --> 07:43.600
<font color="#ffff00">Capture:FRM@ID
Sync:smolhh</font>

07:44.400 --> 07:48.400
B i e r d o p j e . c o m

07:50.800 --> 07:52.400
well, i'm ready to leave.

07:52.500 --> 07:53.800
we just got here.

07:53.900 --> 07:55.800
you know what? i'm actually
with hank on this one.

07:56.100 --> 07:59.000
the average age here is dead.

08:14.500 --> 08:15.900
everyone, please.

08:16.000 --> 08:19.000
welcome tess premoli
as she premieres for us

08:19.100 --> 08:20.800
what will be her final piece

08:20.800 --> 08:23.400
with the san francisco
ballet next sunday.

08:23.400 --> 08:24.900
ballerinas.

08:27.800 --> 08:28.800
wait a moment.

08:28.900 --> 08:30.900
that's the retiree?

08:48.800 --> 08:50.600
that was beautiful.

08:50.800 --> 08:52.500
she certainly is.

08:52.600 --> 08:55.200
hottest card-carrying member
of the a.a.r.p. i've ever seen.

08:55.300 --> 08:56.300
plus, as a retired person,

08:56.300 --> 08:57.800
it won't cost as much
to take her to the movies.

08:57.900 --> 09:00.100
forget it. i call dibs, okay?

09:00.200 --> 09:01.900
any hot ballerina is all mine.

09:02.000 --> 09:03.800
that's one of my ground rules.

09:04.500 --> 09:06.400
anyway, yours is over there.

09:08.900 --> 09:10.500
who is that guy jill's talking to?

09:10.600 --> 09:12.600
not you.

09:14.600 --> 09:16.500
i would love to help you out,
but i'm sorry.

09:16.600 --> 09:17.900
you've already--wait!

09:18.000 --> 09:20.100
don't walk away.
i'm not finished with this.

09:20.200 --> 09:22.200
i am not gonna have
this discussion here.

09:22.300 --> 09:24.500
this conversation
is not over.

09:28.000 --> 09:29.000
hi.

09:29.100 --> 09:30.300
how's your neighbor?

09:30.500 --> 09:31.800
sheila?

09:32.100 --> 09:33.500
she's okay.

09:34.000 --> 09:35.200
better.

09:36.200 --> 09:37.400
are you okay?

09:37.800 --> 09:39.000
mm!

09:39.300 --> 09:40.900
i'm fine.

09:41.000 --> 09:43.700
maybe you should, uh,
slow down there.

09:43.900 --> 09:46.900
now that would
defeat the purpose.

09:47.000 --> 09:49.000
thank you, thank you.

09:49.100 --> 09:50.700
thank you very much.

09:51.000 --> 09:53.800
very happy.
thank you for having me.

09:54.300 --> 09:55.600
thank you.

09:57.900 --> 10:00.100
uh...outstanding work.

10:00.200 --> 10:02.200
having sat through
the nutcracker

10:02.300 --> 10:04.800
every christmas
since i was, like, three,

10:04.900 --> 10:07.000
uh, i can say that
with full confidence.

10:07.100 --> 10:09.300
having played my share
of sugar plum fairies,

10:09.400 --> 10:10.800
i can say thank you.

10:11.700 --> 10:12.900
evan r. lawson.

10:13.000 --> 10:15.300
uh, c.f.o. of hankmed.

10:15.800 --> 10:17.500
and so much more.

10:18.900 --> 10:22.500
- so, yeah.
- excuse me, excuse me--hi.

10:23.300 --> 10:24.600
feel this.

10:24.800 --> 10:26.200
silk.

10:26.900 --> 10:28.800
how much you think
this benefit costs?

10:28.800 --> 10:31.400
uh, i don't know. a lot.

10:31.600 --> 10:34.300
twice that. at least.

10:34.900 --> 10:36.500
do you know how much
these things run?

10:36.600 --> 10:38.100
- i don't.
- i do.

10:38.200 --> 10:40.500
see, we've thrown parties
at the hospital.

10:40.600 --> 10:42.000
we get polyester.

10:42.100 --> 10:43.700
he might as well
just burn the money.

10:43.800 --> 10:45.900
what happened with that man?

10:47.000 --> 10:47.600
what man?

10:47.600 --> 10:49.600
the one who apparently dared you
to chug three glasses of wine

10:49.700 --> 10:51.200
before he got back
or there'd be trouble.

10:51.300 --> 10:53.300
uh, or is that
none of my business?

10:53.400 --> 10:55.000
- bingo.
- got it.

10:55.100 --> 10:55.900
hey.

10:56.000 --> 10:56.900
- hey.
- hi, guy

10:57.000 --> 10:58.100
tucker, libby, jill.

10:58.200 --> 11:00.000
- hi, jill.
- jill, tucker, libby.

11:00.000 --> 11:01.300
hi, jill.

11:01.400 --> 11:02.500
we're gonna go
grab a bite to eat.

11:02.600 --> 11:03.900
it's wall-to-wall food here.

11:04.000 --> 11:07.100
yes, but no one can tell me
if the tuna is farmed or wild.

11:07.200 --> 11:09.900
farmed has, on average,
five times less omega-3s

11:10.000 --> 11:12.000
and is, like, three
times higher in mercury.

11:12.100 --> 11:14.300
and they can't say
whether the grapes were grown

11:14.400 --> 11:15.500
with or without pesticides.

11:15.600 --> 11:19.300
we're talking residue such as
azinphos, carbofuran, metalaxyl.

11:19.400 --> 11:22.100
but as a doctor, i'm sure that's
???

11:22.300 --> 11:23.700
oh, yeah.

11:23.700 --> 11:25.100
totally.

11:25.900 --> 11:28.300
but your date seems
to be having a good time.

11:28.600 --> 11:29.500
- oh, no--
- oh, this--

11:29.600 --> 11:31.000
- is not a date.
- it's not a date.

11:31.000 --> 11:32.400
aw.

11:33.100 --> 11:35.300
what do you kids
call it these days?

11:37.500 --> 11:40.000
listen, why don't we go
back to my place?

11:40.100 --> 11:41.000
you know, dad's not home,

11:41.100 --> 11:42.800
and libby's stocked the fridge

11:42.900 --> 11:45.600
with food so organic
you can taste the dirt.

11:46.300 --> 11:47.700
awesome.

11:48.400 --> 11:50.400
would you like the rib
eye or the tenderloin?

11:50.600 --> 11:51.800
yes.

11:52.900 --> 11:54.800
- hi.
- hi.

11:55.200 --> 11:56.300
you're the doctor, right?

11:56.400 --> 11:58.400
um, i'm actually
not the doctor,

11:58.500 --> 11:59.700
medically speaking.

11:59.800 --> 12:01.900
um, but i run hankmed,
which is--

12:02.000 --> 12:04.300
it's a concierge doctor service.

12:04.500 --> 12:06.200
so... great--great party, huh?

12:06.300 --> 12:07.900
i just feel like,
this place is so cool.

12:08.000 --> 12:10.700
the wine and the food
are so--so cool.

12:10.800 --> 12:11.700
yeah, i hate it.

12:11.700 --> 12:13.100
i hate it too.
do you wanna bail?

12:13.200 --> 12:15.200
i can't duck out
on my own party.

12:15.300 --> 12:16.400
can i buy you dinner?

12:16.500 --> 12:19.800
um, it's free
and i have some.

12:19.900 --> 12:21.900
well, you haven't
even touched yours.

12:22.100 --> 12:24.100
- are you not hungry?
- i'm starving.

12:24.200 --> 12:26.400
somebody made this for me.

12:26.900 --> 12:27.900
i don't wanna sound spoiled,

12:28.000 --> 12:32.500
but i can't tell you how sick i am
of grilled fish and fresh fruit.

12:32.500 --> 12:34.400
now that i'm being
put out to pasture,

12:34.500 --> 12:37.500
i'm craving all that stuff
i've had to avoid my whole life.

12:37.600 --> 12:39.900
i know this charming little spot

12:39.900 --> 12:43.500
that specializes
in just that cuisine.

12:45.500 --> 12:47.700
- wow.
- yeah.

12:47.800 --> 12:50.300
i, uh, i don't play around
when it comes to junk.

12:51.200 --> 12:53.400
i don't even know
where to begin.

12:53.500 --> 12:59.600
well, uh, convention says the
cheese crunches are the amuse.

12:59.600 --> 13:00.600
they're light,
they're cheesy.

13:00.700 --> 13:02.600
they, uh, leave your fingers orange.

13:02.800 --> 13:05.400
the nachos
are the hors d'oeuvres.

13:05.500 --> 13:08.800
they also leave your fingers orange.

13:08.900 --> 13:11.600
and then you've earned the dog.

13:11.700 --> 13:12.600
the dog?

13:12.700 --> 13:14.100
yes, the dog.

13:14.200 --> 13:15.300
the dog must be earned.

13:15.400 --> 13:17.300
i can't remember
the last time i had a--

13:17.300 --> 13:20.800
what if i want to start
with the dog?

13:21.800 --> 13:23.500
i love a rebel.

13:24.300 --> 13:25.200
monsignieur.

13:25.300 --> 13:28.200
uh, last time i checked, the
drinking age in new york was 21.

13:28.300 --> 13:32.300
well, while technically
the hamptons are in new york,

13:32.600 --> 13:35.600
they actually occupy a
time-space continuum of their own.

13:35.700 --> 13:36.900
- ???
- ???

13:36.900 --> 13:39.500
and this is a chateau
avignon from 1990.

13:39.600 --> 13:42.200
the greater crime
would be to not drink it.

13:42.300 --> 13:44.400
well, think how much
more aged it'll be

13:44.400 --> 13:46.700
when you're of age
in five years.

13:46.800 --> 13:49.400
so this wine
is older than you?

13:49.500 --> 13:51.600
jill, age is just a number.

13:51.700 --> 13:53.000
right.

13:53.400 --> 13:55.300
yeah, everything's
just a number.

13:55.400 --> 13:57.300
that's how you people think.

13:57.400 --> 13:59.200
"you people"?

13:59.500 --> 14:01.300
like mr. kliner.

14:01.900 --> 14:03.800
he was our biggest donor.

14:03.900 --> 14:07.900
he had plenty of money to throw a
retirement party for a ballerina,

14:08.000 --> 14:12.000
but not enough to honor
his pledge to the free clinic.

14:12.200 --> 14:13.700
and for the record,

14:13.800 --> 14:16.100
free clinics--
they're not free.

14:16.200 --> 14:17.300
big misnomer.

14:17.400 --> 14:18.800
they're expensive.

14:18.900 --> 14:22.700
only you can't call 'em that,
or nobody would come.

14:23.600 --> 14:25.300
you know what, maybe--
why don't we, um,

14:25.400 --> 14:26.400
why don't we walk it off a little?

14:26.500 --> 14:27.300
you wanna go for a walk?

14:27.400 --> 14:29.600
- yeah, let's go.
- let's go for a walk.

14:29.600 --> 14:30.800
- okay.
- okay.

14:30.800 --> 14:32.300
come with me, jill.

14:32.400 --> 14:34.900
i mean, just take
the items in this house.

14:35.100 --> 14:39.800
that model boat,
or that ancient map.

14:40.000 --> 14:42.300
or these guitars,
signed by lennon.

14:42.300 --> 14:44.300
john, not vladimir.

14:44.500 --> 14:47.000
if it were vladimir, that'd
really be worth something.

14:47.400 --> 14:50.000
each one of these gems could
float a year of my clinic.

14:50.100 --> 14:55.100
but i guess paying god knows what
for a pair of torn jeans is-- oh.

14:55.100 --> 14:56.500
oh, my god.

14:56.600 --> 14:59.000
are these really springsteen's?

14:59.200 --> 15:02.800
uh, that or they're running
low on closet space.

15:03.700 --> 15:05.400
you're cute.

15:05.900 --> 15:07.700
okay then.

15:08.500 --> 15:11.100
and voila.

15:11.500 --> 15:14.200
mustard, relish, and onions,
just as god intended it.

15:14.300 --> 15:15.000
no ketchup?

15:15.100 --> 15:17.400
ketchup is for dilettantes
and three year olds.

15:17.500 --> 15:19.400
well, all right then.

15:20.600 --> 15:22.000
okay.

15:23.000 --> 15:24.700
i am so gonna enjoy this.

15:24.800 --> 15:26.900
and not just for
the reason you think.

15:29.300 --> 15:30.700
mm.

15:31.500 --> 15:32.600
yeah?

15:32.700 --> 15:33.800
mm-hmm.

15:33.900 --> 15:35.500
guess it was
worth the wait.

15:49.200 --> 15:50.600
what happened to me?

15:50.800 --> 15:51.700
i'm not sure.

15:51.800 --> 15:52.900
did you eat today?

15:53.000 --> 15:54.500
no, i was too nervous.

15:54.600 --> 15:58.100
i did have a glass
of wine. or two.

15:58.200 --> 15:59.000
oh.

15:59.200 --> 16:01.900
do you remember having
any chest pains,

16:01.900 --> 16:03.900
shortness of breath, headache?

16:04.000 --> 16:06.300
no, nothing.
not that i can remember.

16:06.300 --> 16:08.200
okay, tess,
this is important.

16:08.300 --> 16:09.600
are you on any meds?

16:09.800 --> 16:12.200
do you take recreational
drugs of any kind?

16:12.200 --> 16:14.200
no, no, nothing like that.

16:14.900 --> 16:15.800
am i gonna be okay?

16:15.900 --> 16:17.400
i have my last show next week.

16:17.500 --> 16:19.700
for some reason, your blood
pressure went down to a level

16:19.700 --> 16:22.200
that didn't allow blood
to be pumped to your brain.

16:22.500 --> 16:24.600
it may have been a reaction
to your not eating

16:24.700 --> 16:26.700
and then drinking alcohol
while being tired,

16:26.800 --> 16:28.100
and so you fainted.

16:28.400 --> 16:29.900
you should just--
you should go home,

16:30.000 --> 16:31.000
eat, and get some rest.

16:31.100 --> 16:32.400
and call me if
there are any problems.

16:32.500 --> 16:33.800
okay, i will do that.
thank you.

16:33.900 --> 16:35.200
okay, sure.

16:35.400 --> 16:36.300
i'll be right back, okay?

16:36.400 --> 16:37.700
okay.

16:37.900 --> 16:39.300
thank you for handling that.

16:39.300 --> 16:42.700
you have no idea
how embarrassing this is.

16:45.100 --> 16:46.000
or maybe you do.

16:46.100 --> 16:47.000
long story. she's fine.

16:47.100 --> 16:48.500
wow, two women passed out.

16:48.600 --> 16:49.900
mom would be so proud.

16:49.900 --> 16:51.600
shut up. are you okay to drive?

16:51.700 --> 16:54.200
yeah, unless they've started spiking
the arctic freezees, i'm fine.

16:54.300 --> 16:55.200
good.

17:00.800 --> 17:02.300
hey, jill.

17:03.500 --> 17:05.599
- we're here.
-  hi.

17:06.099 --> 17:07.599
uh, how long
have i been out?

17:07.700 --> 17:10.099
a couple minutes,
give or take an hour.

17:12.900 --> 17:13.500
let me help you.

17:13.599 --> 17:17.000
i'm fine. i'm fine.

17:19.900 --> 17:21.500
did you want--

17:23.099 --> 17:24.900
the letters for my clinic.

17:25.300 --> 17:26.900
pointless now.

17:27.099 --> 17:28.500
throw 'em away, please.

17:28.600 --> 17:31.200
they're garbage anyway.

17:31.400 --> 17:32.200
oh, and...

17:32.300 --> 17:33.400
thank you for driving me home.

17:33.500 --> 17:37.200
i'm sure this is not how
you expected your night to go.

17:37.300 --> 17:39.500
hey, you surprise people.

17:39.800 --> 17:41.200
hmm.

18:03.000 --> 18:05.300
- dr. lawson?
- hey.

18:05.400 --> 18:06.700
hi.

18:08.500 --> 18:09.300
is everything okay?

18:09.400 --> 18:10.700
i'm sorry to bother you.

18:10.800 --> 18:13.700
i was just wondering
if we could talk in private?

18:13.700 --> 18:16.100
of course, yeah.
let's take a walk.

18:18.700 --> 18:21.600
i, um, wasn't entirely
honest last night.

18:21.700 --> 18:23.300
i've been dancing
since i was three,

18:23.400 --> 18:25.000
professionally
since i was five.

18:25.100 --> 18:27.000
and don't get me wrong, i love it.

18:27.200 --> 18:30.100
i loved it, but, um,
we take a pounding.

18:30.100 --> 18:32.500
and sometimes, dancers,
for the pain,

18:33.000 --> 18:34.500
the--the anxiety of performance,

18:34.600 --> 18:35.800
weight, trying to stay the best,

18:35.800 --> 18:38.200
we...we take things.

18:38.300 --> 18:40.000
pain medication? diet pills?

18:40.100 --> 18:41.700
anti-anxiety.

18:41.800 --> 18:43.300
are you on all three?

18:43.400 --> 18:45.500
sometimes, yeah.

18:46.800 --> 18:48.800
do you think that's
what caused me to faint?

18:48.900 --> 18:51.100
it's possible. i-i can't know
without doing some blood work.

18:51.200 --> 18:53.700
i'd love to have divya,
my associate, do a full workup.

18:53.800 --> 18:56.400
i have to be able
to dance next week.

18:56.900 --> 18:58.900
dancing's been my whole life, and--

18:59.300 --> 19:01.200

19:02.200 --> 19:03.400
hey, guys.

19:03.500 --> 19:04.900

19:05.100 --> 19:07.000
just going for a run, and...

19:07.100 --> 19:08.500
just run into people.

19:09.000 --> 19:09.700
what's going on?

19:09.800 --> 19:11.200
we were just
going for a walk.

19:11.300 --> 19:12.600
yeah, i was just
showing tess the dunes.

19:12.700 --> 19:14.000
oh, dynamite, dunes.
okay, cool.

19:14.000 --> 19:15.300
yeah, i should get going.

19:15.300 --> 19:17.000
um, i don't wanna
be late, so...

19:17.200 --> 19:18.300
it was really nice
seeing you guys.

19:18.300 --> 19:20.000
yeah, you too, tess.

19:20.100 --> 19:21.900
great seeing you.

19:22.400 --> 19:23.600
did i or did i not call dibs?

19:23.700 --> 19:25.800
relax, i wasn't making a move.

19:26.000 --> 19:27.200
"making a move"?

19:27.300 --> 19:28.100
you actually just said that?

19:28.200 --> 19:29.000
i've been out of the game.

19:29.100 --> 19:31.000
for how long, since
the sinking of the lusitania?

19:31.100 --> 19:32.300
wow.

19:33.200 --> 19:33.900
so what were you doing, then?

19:34.000 --> 19:35.100
talking, that's all i can say.

19:35.100 --> 19:37.400
if you're pulling
doctor-patient confidentiality,

19:37.500 --> 19:39.300
- i'm exempt.
- no, actually, you're not.

19:39.400 --> 19:42.100
uh, need i remind you, i'm
the c.f.o. of hankmed, okay?

19:42.200 --> 19:42.800
c.f.o.

19:42.800 --> 19:45.800
who is also making a move
on my patient.

19:47.600 --> 19:48.900
she ask about me?

19:49.000 --> 19:50.200
we weren't talking about you.

19:50.300 --> 19:51.800
okay, that wasn't my question.

19:52.300 --> 19:53.900
i like her.

19:54.100 --> 19:55.900
and it's not just 'cause
she's a ballerina, either.

19:56.100 --> 19:57.300
although i must say
that doesn't hurt.

19:57.500 --> 20:00.200
look, if you like her,
then ask her out.

20:00.400 --> 20:04.400
did she tell you to tell me that?

20:00.500 --> 20:01.400
Did she tell you to tell me that?

20:01.500 --> 20:03.200
Yes, by my locker,before homeroom.

20:03.300 --> 20:05.100
We did not talk about you.

20:05.200 --> 20:06.200
Okay, stop saying that.

20:14.700 --> 20:15.500
Uh, excuse me.

20:15.700 --> 20:17.600
Do you know where i can find james harper?

20:17.800 --> 20:18.900
Go fish yourself.

20:19.800 --> 20:20.500
Excuse me?

20:20.800 --> 20:22.000
-That's the name of his boat.
-Ah.

20:22.300 --> 20:23.300
Third boat down the pier.

20:23.400 --> 20:24.300
Okay, uh...

20:24.700 --> 20:26.400
You could've just--Thank you.

20:30.900 --> 20:31.600
Excuse me.

20:32.200 --> 20:33.400
Are you james harper?

20:33.500 --> 20:34.600
Name's jim.What do you want?

20:35.000 --> 20:37.300
Hi.My name's hank lawson.

20:39.600 --> 20:40.700
You selling something?

20:40.800 --> 20:42.000
Nope, i'm a doctor.

20:44.000 --> 20:44.900
Have a nice day.

20:45.400 --> 20:46.100
Quick guess.

20:46.400 --> 20:49.600
Unless the yellow in your eyes
and your complexion Is from carrots,

20:49.900 --> 20:52.600
And that paunch in your
midsection Is from too many budweisers,

20:52.800 --> 20:54.900
My hunch is you've got
the symptoms of hep c.

20:55.200 --> 20:56.500
You need to take care of yourself.

20:56.600 --> 20:57.200
I can help you.

20:57.400 --> 20:58.200
Course you can.

20:59.300 --> 21:00.100
Let me guess.

21:00.500 --> 21:02.800
Fill out some forms,sit and wait.

21:03.300 --> 21:04.800
And wait.
And wait.

21:06.200 --> 21:07.200
I've been through the system.

21:07.700 --> 21:08.700
Done the patient history.

21:08.800 --> 21:10.000
Gotten the piss-Poor care.

21:10.200 --> 21:11.300
And been charged through the nose.

21:11.400 --> 21:13.000
-I'll pass.
-I understand.

21:13.100 --> 21:15.500
You don't understand
the first thing about it,Doctor.

21:15.600 --> 21:17.500
Look, hey, can i at least
give you my card?

21:19.000 --> 21:19.600
No.

21:24.200 --> 21:26.000
I know you're the chief of neurosurgery.

21:26.100 --> 21:29.300
But starting a stereotaxic
oncological surgery program

21:29.400 --> 21:33.200
Will cost the hospital millions
in startup That we just don't have.

21:36.300 --> 21:39.400
Could you yell
a little quieter, please?

21:43.300 --> 21:45.000
Okay. Yeah--

21:45.800 --> 21:48.100
I'm coming down there
To haggle this out face to face.

21:49.800 --> 21:51.700
-Hi.
-Hi.

21:52.100 --> 21:54.500
-Um, hi.
-Hey.

21:54.600 --> 22:00.300
Uh, whatever i said last night,
Whatever i did, blanket apology.

22:00.400 --> 22:01.300
I don't drink a lot.

22:01.400 --> 22:03.900
In fact, the last time
i got that drunk,

22:04.000 --> 22:06.500
I had just gotten my degree
in health administration.

22:06.700 --> 22:08.500
And yes, i am aware
of the irony.

22:08.600 --> 22:11.500
Hey, listen.
You were a lady.

22:12.000 --> 22:13.600
Then i must've been really hammered.

22:14.100 --> 22:15.500
Please, sit.

22:17.200 --> 22:19.900
I am not the woman
who makes a fool of herself At a party.

22:20.000 --> 22:22.300
I'm the woman
who makes fun of that woman.

22:22.400 --> 22:23.800
-So you judge.
-Yes.

22:24.000 --> 22:26.500
-Nice.
-But only in the most non-Judgmental way.

22:26.600 --> 22:27.200
- Right.

22:28.000 --> 22:29.000
It was a tough night.

22:29.800 --> 22:33.000
I have been working
on that clinic for three years.

22:33.500 --> 22:36.200
And when the economy tanked,
A lot of the donors pulled out.

22:36.600 --> 22:40.900
Kliner was my biggest,
best, and last hope.

22:41.300 --> 22:42.100
I'm sorry.

22:43.700 --> 22:44.800
Well, this should help.

22:45.400 --> 22:46.700
The hangover, at least.

22:47.400 --> 22:49.600
I have no money to give you,
but i have some aspirin.

22:49.800 --> 22:50.900
I hope you didn't buy these.

22:51.000 --> 22:53.000
You know, i do work in a hospital.

22:53.100 --> 22:54.600
No, i stole them from your hospital.

22:55.200 --> 22:55.800
Mm.

22:57.300 --> 23:00.900
Okay, i have to go And haggle
with the chief of radiology.

23:01.400 --> 23:05.200
Uh...so i didn't just come bearing aspirin.

23:05.300 --> 23:06.000
I could use your help.

23:06.200 --> 23:07.400
- Name it.
-Jim harper.

23:07.500 --> 23:08.600
Jim harper?What about him?

23:08.700 --> 23:09.600
I'd like to see his medical file.

23:11.300 --> 23:12.500
You read one of my letters.

23:13.800 --> 23:14.900
I can't believe you did that.

23:15.000 --> 23:15.800
I glanced.

23:16.100 --> 23:17.100
Okay, i read.
I read.

23:17.200 --> 23:18.800
Look, i think he has hep c.

23:19.800 --> 23:22.600
I can't give you a patient's
information Without their consent.

23:22.700 --> 23:24.100
Well, jim didn't seem like the giving type.

23:24.200 --> 23:25.100
You went to see him?

23:27.000 --> 23:28.200
I can't believe you.

23:28.400 --> 23:31.300
Do you have any idea
how wrong that is,How unethical?

23:31.700 --> 23:35.700
Not to mention,you completely violated
my trust By even looking at that letter.

23:35.800 --> 23:38.400
I'm sorry, jill,but sometimes you've
got to work Outside the system, right?

23:38.600 --> 23:39.500
Bend the rules.

23:39.600 --> 23:41.100
-Break the law?
-The system is broken.

23:41.200 --> 23:42.300
You know that as well as i do.

23:42.400 --> 23:43.600
It's why you're starting your clinic.

23:43.700 --> 23:44.300
Was.

23:44.700 --> 23:45.800
The man needs help.

23:46.000 --> 23:47.100
Interferon, probably.

23:47.300 --> 23:49.400
I want to help him.
I can help him.

23:50.400 --> 23:53.200
And if we are who we treat and
we treat no one,What does that make us?

23:53.300 --> 23:54.000
I'm sorry, hank.

23:55.000 --> 23:57.400
Breaking the rules is not part
of my job description.

23:57.500 --> 23:58.500
??

24:08.900 --> 24:10.700
Hey.Everything okay?

24:11.100 --> 24:13.100
Yeah.Everything okay with you?

24:13.200 --> 24:15.500
Yeah, you texted me.To come here.

24:16.200 --> 24:17.600
You showed up at the wrong mansion.

24:18.000 --> 24:20.300
Hank, you've really got to work
on your concierge doctoring.

24:21.200 --> 24:22.400
I contacted you.

24:23.100 --> 24:24.300
I'm marshall bryant.

24:25.700 --> 24:27.100
You must be dr. Lawson.

24:27.300 --> 24:28.600
No, uh, hank.

24:29.200 --> 24:30.000
Nice to meet you.

24:31.900 --> 24:33.600
Look what--Look what he bought me.

24:34.700 --> 24:35.300
Wow.

24:35.600 --> 24:36.300
Great plane.

24:36.400 --> 24:37.500
Tucker, would you give us a minute?

24:37.600 --> 24:38.300
Yeah, sure.

24:41.500 --> 24:42.800
You're younger than i imagined.

24:43.100 --> 24:47.100
Most concierge doctors around here
Are on their third wives and last legs.

24:48.300 --> 24:49.900
Well, they've--
They've set the bar high.

24:50.600 --> 24:53.500
Dr. Lawson,i want to thank you
For taking such good care of my son.

24:53.600 --> 24:54.900
Hank, please.

24:55.200 --> 24:56.300
Tucker's quite a young man.

24:56.500 --> 24:57.200
He is that.

24:57.700 --> 25:00.400
Sometimes i feel like
i'm the kid And he's the adult.

25:00.900 --> 25:01.700
I know what you mean.

25:02.400 --> 25:03.200
This is for you.

25:03.300 --> 25:04.500
If it's not enough,
you'll let me know.

25:05.300 --> 25:07.500
Oh, uh...no, i'm sure it's fine.

25:07.700 --> 25:08.500
Thanks.

25:08.900 --> 25:11.800
I'd love to offer you a drink,
but my jet is waiting.

25:12.400 --> 25:13.000
Right.

25:15.200 --> 25:16.500
Uh, listen, mr. Bryant.

25:17.500 --> 25:20.400
While i have you,
i-I know you're a busy man.

25:20.500 --> 25:21.100
Oh, boy.

25:22.000 --> 25:23.700
Tucker's drug test
come back positive?

25:23.800 --> 25:25.400
Did his...no.

25:25.500 --> 25:26.400
Um, no.

25:27.200 --> 25:28.800
This is not about tucker's health.

25:29.400 --> 25:30.500
Not his physical health.

25:30.600 --> 25:31.600
What is it about, then?

25:32.600 --> 25:33.600
Uh, well...

25:34.600 --> 25:36.700
I hope i'm not overstepping
any boundaries here.

25:37.400 --> 25:41.000
Um, tucker seems to be
missing something in his life.

25:41.900 --> 25:44.000
I--See, i had a similar
situation when i was his age.

25:44.100 --> 25:44.900
My father...

25:46.100 --> 25:49.900
Well, anyway,maybe you
could spend A little more time with him.

25:50.900 --> 25:53.700
He seems like he could use
some more dad time.

25:55.500 --> 25:56.100
Huh.

25:58.700 --> 25:59.800
You a psychiatrist?

26:00.300 --> 26:00.900
No.

26:01.400 --> 26:02.400
Psychotherapist?

26:03.100 --> 26:03.600
No.

26:03.700 --> 26:06.000
Right.You're a concierge doctor.

26:06.600 --> 26:07.900
Pretty simple concept.

26:08.000 --> 26:09.900
Come when called,
fix patient, cash check.

26:11.000 --> 26:13.100
With all due respect,While that may be
what you're used to,

26:14.100 --> 26:15.200
That's not how i do it.

26:15.300 --> 26:16.700
However you do it,hank,

26:18.300 --> 26:19.600
You don't do it
for us any more.

26:20.700 --> 26:22.200
Let that check
be your severance, hmm?

26:35.600 --> 26:36.200
Hi.

26:36.700 --> 26:39.100
Sorry to be laying in wait
at your house,

26:39.200 --> 26:41.400
But i have something for you.

26:42.200 --> 26:43.800
Fine, i'll see another property.

26:43.900 --> 26:46.500
But it should have a fabulous room
And the person showing it should have leprosy.

26:47.300 --> 26:48.300
Those are my conditions.

26:48.400 --> 26:49.800
No, something better.

26:50.500 --> 26:53.700
This was for a patient Who
no longer comes to the hospital.

26:55.200 --> 26:56.900
It--It's interferon.

26:57.200 --> 26:58.200
We're overstocked.

26:58.500 --> 26:59.600
Before this batch goes bad,

26:59.700 --> 27:01.100
I thought maybe you knew
somebody who could use it.

27:02.400 --> 27:03.000
All right.

27:04.200 --> 27:05.900
Spielberg's pad
is down that way.

27:07.000 --> 27:09.700
And martha stewart has a
modest little mansion Over there.

27:10.000 --> 27:14.600
And the seinfeld summer place
Is about five palaces on the left.

27:14.700 --> 27:17.000
You can't see it,
but it's over there.

27:18.600 --> 27:20.600
You seem to be an expert
on the hamptons.

27:20.700 --> 27:21.800
Did you come here growing up?

27:22.000 --> 27:23.900
Uh, no,i moved out to
the hamptons A couple weeks ago.

27:24.000 --> 27:25.200
- Really?
-Mm-Hmm.

27:25.400 --> 27:26.300
Where are you from?

27:26.400 --> 27:27.300
Different habitat.

27:27.900 --> 27:29.700
Brooklyn, via jersey.

27:30.400 --> 27:33.700
But, uh, then hank had
a little premature Midlife crisis, and...

27:34.500 --> 27:36.800
You know, i guess i did
what any good brother would do.

27:36.900 --> 27:37.900
I sacrificed for family.

27:38.700 --> 27:40.300
Yeah, that hut you're
living in seems harrowing.

27:40.400 --> 27:41.500
It's disgusting, you know.

27:41.700 --> 27:43.500
But sometimes you've just
got to take one for the team.

27:44.000 --> 27:44.600
I know.

27:46.700 --> 27:48.400
Seriously, though, it's--
It's been nice.

27:49.300 --> 27:51.500
Life kind of dead-Ended for me in new york.

27:53.900 --> 27:55.200
And i am all about opportunity.

27:55.700 --> 27:57.900
And it's all opportunity out here.

27:59.900 --> 28:01.000
Kind of like us right now.

28:04.700 --> 28:06.000
Would you like to grab lunch?

28:06.100 --> 28:08.100
Oh, it's just i'm...

28:09.200 --> 28:11.100
I'm having fun.
I don't want to ruin it.

28:11.300 --> 28:12.000
What--

28:12.100 --> 28:15.100
Food and i have a contentious relationship.

28:15.200 --> 28:17.400
Ever since i was a young dancer
trying to make it.

28:19.200 --> 28:20.300
Kind of messed me up.

28:21.700 --> 28:22.300
Hmm.

28:23.400 --> 28:24.800
Then let me unmess you.

29:29.200 --> 29:30.100
I'm back.

29:33.000 --> 29:34.200
I'll get my harpoon.

29:34.300 --> 29:36.700
As inviting as that sounds,
i won't stay long.

29:37.000 --> 29:38.100
The doctor's mantra.

29:38.200 --> 29:39.300
Look, you know,
for what it's worth,

29:39.400 --> 29:41.300
I'm not a big fan
of hospitals myself.

29:41.400 --> 29:43.600
In fact, i just got fired
by one a few weeks ago.

29:43.700 --> 29:44.600
Well, that's reassuring.

29:44.700 --> 29:46.400
Not--No.
Not for medical reasons.

29:46.500 --> 29:50.700
Look...Hospitals are bureaucracies,right?

29:50.900 --> 29:52.500
Bureaucracies screw people.

29:52.800 --> 29:54.300
They overcharge you if you're insured,

29:54.400 --> 29:55.400
And they really do it if you're not,

29:55.500 --> 29:56.400
Just 'cause they can.

29:56.700 --> 29:59.500
You get zero leverage and
no alternatives,So you get screwed.

30:00.600 --> 30:02.200
It's--It's like out here
with the--

30:02.300 --> 30:05.300
With the gas docks when they
price gouge you After a hurricane.

30:05.400 --> 30:06.500
The system sucks.

30:07.900 --> 30:08.700
But you're sick.

30:09.600 --> 30:11.500
And you're gonna get sicker
if you don't get treatment.

30:12.700 --> 30:13.600
I'd like to help you.

30:14.100 --> 30:15.000
That's what they all say.

30:15.700 --> 30:16.700
Then the bill comes.

30:16.800 --> 30:17.300
There is no bill.

30:18.400 --> 30:23.100
No, i'm gonna be here for you
week in, week out.

30:24.200 --> 30:26.500
No red tape, no forms.

30:27.100 --> 30:28.100
No harpoon.

30:29.400 --> 30:30.200
Just me.

30:30.600 --> 30:31.600
So what's the catch?

30:33.500 --> 30:34.700
You're the fisherman,you tell me.

30:41.100 --> 30:43.200
Wow, this is quite a spread.

30:43.400 --> 30:44.300
What's on the menu?

30:44.600 --> 30:45.500
Um, okay.

30:45.600 --> 30:48.800
So the best meal i've ever had
in my entire life Was in machu picchu.

30:49.200 --> 30:50.100
You ever been to machu picchu?

30:50.200 --> 30:50.900
Um, no.

30:51.000 --> 30:53.400
If my company doesn't perform
there,I haven't been.

30:53.500 --> 30:55.400
Okay, basically,it's like heaven on earth.

30:55.500 --> 30:56.800
Like, you have to go one day.

30:56.900 --> 30:57.600
Like, everybody should go.

30:58.300 --> 31:02.300
Tonight, i have recreated
that meal In painstaking detail.

31:02.500 --> 31:05.300
So if you would,senorita.

31:06.300 --> 31:07.300
??

31:07.700 --> 31:10.200
Okay,just take a deep breath.

31:10.300 --> 31:11.000
Relax.

31:15.200 --> 31:16.000
Close your eyes.

31:17.700 --> 31:18.700
I'm ready.I'm there.

31:24.800 --> 31:25.600
Mm.

31:27.500 --> 31:28.800
This is really good.

31:30.800 --> 31:31.600
It tastes really good.

31:31.700 --> 31:32.900
That's good.It's--Yeah.

31:33.000 --> 31:34.500
It's all about just
becoming one with the food.

31:35.900 --> 31:36.500
Ready for bite two?

31:43.600 --> 31:44.400
Mm.

31:45.600 --> 31:47.000
Mm, that's delicious.

31:47.400 --> 31:48.000
Wow.

31:48.500 --> 31:49.600
Big points.

31:51.200 --> 31:53.100
I've been on a lot of dates
around the world,

31:53.200 --> 31:55.000
But you're the first guy
to ever feed me.

31:55.200 --> 31:56.600
Well, you're the first girl
i've ever fed.

31:56.700 --> 31:57.400
So...

31:58.400 --> 32:00.200
Hey, am i interrupting--

32:00.300 --> 32:00.900
Uh, big time.

32:01.100 --> 32:02.500
Would you excuse me
for one second?

32:03.100 --> 32:03.800
Yeah.

32:04.100 --> 32:05.000
-Hey.
-Hey.

32:05.200 --> 32:06.400
So first of all, get out.

32:06.700 --> 32:08.900
But before you do that,
just know,I totally fixed her.

32:09.000 --> 32:09.800
Problem solved.

32:09.900 --> 32:12.100
Uh, which problem
would we be talking about?

32:12.200 --> 32:13.900
Tess's eating problem.
The whole passing out problem.

32:14.000 --> 32:15.700
All problems?
Solved. Me.

32:15.800 --> 32:16.900
Ask her.
Mind over matter.

32:20.700 --> 32:21.500
What's happening?

32:22.200 --> 32:23.000
She's aspirating.

32:23.100 --> 32:24.700
Her food is stuck
in her upper trachea.

32:24.800 --> 32:26.300
Get the emergency medical kit.

32:31.500 --> 32:32.100
Thank you.

32:33.500 --> 32:35.000
Can i help, or do you want me
to do something?

32:40.400 --> 32:41.000
Oh...

32:44.800 --> 32:45.900
-Get it out!
- I'm trying.

32:47.600 --> 32:48.200
All right.

32:49.700 --> 32:51.200
Is she bleeding, or--

32:52.900 --> 32:54.200
Oh, my god.
Okay.

33:01.100 --> 33:02.700
Were you eating before you fainted?

33:02.900 --> 33:05.100
Chorizo bouillabaisse.
It's a peruvian specialty.

33:05.200 --> 33:06.000
Chorizo.

33:06.700 --> 33:07.800
The other night
it was a hot dog.

33:07.900 --> 33:10.500
Are you thinking anaphylactic
reaction to nitrates?

33:10.700 --> 33:11.300
Lines up.

33:11.400 --> 33:12.400
No, it's not.

33:12.500 --> 33:13.500
How can you be so sure?

33:14.200 --> 33:16.100
Because it's happened before.

33:16.600 --> 33:18.200
And not just from nitrates.

33:18.300 --> 33:19.200
Why didn't you tell me that?

33:19.300 --> 33:20.700
There are certain foods
that i love,

33:21.000 --> 33:23.200
That i crave,
that i can't have.

33:23.300 --> 33:24.600
But sometimes i do.

33:27.500 --> 33:28.500
Were you eating this?

33:28.800 --> 33:29.900
Yeah, just a bite.

33:30.900 --> 33:33.200
Okay, um, you're going
on a heart monitor,

33:33.300 --> 33:35.200
And you're gonna eat
a piece of pepperoni pizza.

33:37.900 --> 33:39.000
You really want me to eat that?

33:39.100 --> 33:39.700
You really want her
to eat that?

33:39.800 --> 33:41.800
Yes, i really want her
to eat that.

33:48.300 --> 33:49.200
Step it up, hank.

33:49.400 --> 33:50.000
Okay.

33:50.400 --> 33:52.500
Tess, i want you to take
a big bite of the crust.

34:00.000 --> 34:01.200
-Whoa, whoa, whoa!
- Hank, she's bradying down.

34:02.000 --> 34:03.100
She's going into
cardiogenic shock.

34:03.200 --> 34:05.200
- Shock her! Hit her!
Feed her a snickers!

34:05.300 --> 34:07.100
-Do something!
- Be patient.

34:10.600 --> 34:11.500
Hold on.

34:13.199 --> 34:14.800
Wait wait wait.

34:15.900 --> 34:16.500
You okay?

34:17.300 --> 34:18.100
Yeah, i think so.

34:18.300 --> 34:19.199
Stay down, stay down.

34:19.300 --> 34:20.400
Let your body adjust.

34:20.699 --> 34:21.600
What is it?
What's wrong with her?

34:22.100 --> 34:23.900
Is she allergic
to mediocre pizza, what?

34:24.300 --> 34:24.900
No.

34:25.100 --> 34:26.300
It's not an allergy.

34:26.600 --> 34:29.699
I think you have a condition
That's called deglutition syncope.

34:31.000 --> 34:32.400
You eat certain foods,
you pass out.

34:32.500 --> 34:35.800
It's an extremely rare condition
That causes an atrioventricular block

34:35.900 --> 34:37.699
When you eat specific types of food.

34:37.800 --> 34:40.199
Yeah, your heart is reacting
to certain carbohydrates.

34:40.300 --> 34:42.600
Some have it with carbonated
beverages, some with chocolate.

34:42.699 --> 34:43.900
So it wasn't the hot dog,
it was the bun.

34:44.300 --> 34:45.600
Gold star, evan.

34:47.600 --> 34:49.600
So...So there's
something wrong with my heart?

34:49.699 --> 34:50.300
There is.

34:50.500 --> 34:51.900
You need to see a cardiologist.

34:52.000 --> 34:52.900
I can recommend one.

34:53.400 --> 34:54.900
Uh, they'll probably want
to put in a pacemaker.

34:55.000 --> 34:56.500
You know, it's a good thing
we found it.

34:56.600 --> 34:58.200
If you'd had an episode
while you were driving,

34:58.600 --> 34:59.600
I mean,it could have been fatal.

34:59.700 --> 35:00.400
Wait, hold up a second.

35:00.600 --> 35:02.000
-She needs a pacemaker?
-Yeah.

35:02.100 --> 35:04.600
A cardiologist can put it in
under light sedation.

35:04.700 --> 35:06.700
Will i be able to dance
my final performance?

35:06.800 --> 35:08.900
Yes, as long as you avoid these carbs.

35:09.100 --> 35:10.300
And after your surgery,

35:10.500 --> 35:14.900
You can enjoy a long and happy retirement
Eating as much junk food as you want.

35:15.200 --> 35:15.900
Thank you.

35:16.200 --> 35:17.200
-you're welcome.
-you're welcome.

35:22.400 --> 35:24.000
Feed me, i beg you.

35:24.300 --> 35:25.700
Uh, how do you feel about fish?

35:27.000 --> 35:29.100
I love fish.

35:29.300 --> 35:33.900
That's good,because some dude named jim
Just dropped off two dozen striped bass.

35:34.000 --> 35:37.100
Said they were for you,
And scared the bejeezus out of me.

35:37.300 --> 35:37.900
me too.

35:38.000 --> 35:39.200
I will explain over dinner.

35:39.900 --> 35:41.300
This is civilized.

35:41.500 --> 35:43.000
Yeah.Like gentlemen.

35:43.200 --> 35:44.300
We should do this every night.

35:44.500 --> 35:45.800
As long as you stay out of the kitchen, okay.

35:47.400 --> 35:49.100
You cook, i'll clean.

35:49.200 --> 35:51.400
I'll even pick up my clothes.
Or try.

35:51.700 --> 35:52.500
Henry.

35:53.700 --> 35:55.100
Done. And done.

35:55.500 --> 35:56.200
Clink.

35:58.700 --> 36:00.800
The two of us,keeping a house in order?

36:00.900 --> 36:03.700
Mom would be so...shocked.

36:04.600 --> 36:05.200
Hi.

36:06.200 --> 36:07.400
Oh, hey.
Come on in.

36:07.700 --> 36:09.600
I just wanted to say thank you.

36:09.900 --> 36:10.800
Oh, yeah.No need.

36:10.900 --> 36:12.200
It's--It's what i do.

36:12.300 --> 36:15.500
Well, i-I wanted
to say thank you to evan too.

36:16.100 --> 36:16.700
Hi.

36:17.700 --> 36:19.000
How's the old ticker?

36:20.900 --> 36:22.800
I was just heading out
to mow the--

36:22.900 --> 36:24.300
- Bye.
- Bye.

36:27.400 --> 36:31.000
So...i'm leaving tomorrow
to see that cardiologist.

36:31.100 --> 36:32.900
Tomorrow?
Wow, that's soon.

36:33.100 --> 36:37.300
I know, which is why i wanted to say
thank you For helping me have so much fun.

36:37.400 --> 36:38.800
You got a warped sense of fun, lady.

36:38.900 --> 36:40.900
No, i mean it.
I had a great time.

36:41.000 --> 36:42.900
I mean, other than
passing out a lot.

36:43.600 --> 36:45.600
I did a lot of things with you
i haven't done in years.

36:45.900 --> 36:48.800
I usually get that After
i've dated a girl for a long time.

36:49.000 --> 36:50.100
I'm serious, evan.

36:50.200 --> 36:52.100
I really loved
our time together.

36:52.200 --> 36:54.600
I mean, maybe it didn't
mean much to you,

36:54.700 --> 36:55.800
But it meant a lot to me.

36:57.400 --> 36:58.600
Uh, it meant a lot to me too.

36:59.200 --> 37:00.800
Bought a ticket for machu picchu.

37:01.600 --> 37:02.500
I'm gonna hike it.

37:03.000 --> 37:04.800
I'm flying to cuzco
after the surgery.

37:06.300 --> 37:07.500
You're going to machu picchu?

37:07.600 --> 37:09.400
Yeah, after what you said,
how could i not?

37:09.500 --> 37:10.400
Okay, this is awkward.

37:10.500 --> 37:12.400
Um, i made that up.

37:13.000 --> 37:14.400
I've never even been
to machu picchu.

37:14.600 --> 37:16.500
I-I read it in a magazine.

37:16.600 --> 37:18.300
I thought it would
make the meal sound better.

37:18.400 --> 37:20.100
Like, i couldn't even
find machu picchu on a map.

37:20.200 --> 37:21.400
I don't even know
what country it's in.

37:21.600 --> 37:22.800
Like, maybe it is a country.

37:22.900 --> 37:24.900
Is it like a mountain village,
or what is it?

37:25.000 --> 37:26.600
Well, yeah,after you served, um,

37:26.700 --> 37:28.000
Garlic bread and lobster,

37:28.200 --> 37:31.700
I was wondering if this greatest meal
ever Was at a sizzler in machu picchu.

37:31.800 --> 37:32.700
But it doesn't matter.

37:33.400 --> 37:36.400
I'm gonna have an adventure,
And i need an adventure.

37:36.500 --> 37:37.100
Of course.

37:38.000 --> 37:38.600
Okay.

37:38.700 --> 37:42.800
Yeah, but before i go,There's
just this one thing that i have to do.

37:54.800 --> 37:56.200
God, i hate machu picchu.

38:08.200 --> 38:09.800
That's quite a maneuver,maverick.

38:09.900 --> 38:10.800
Maverick?

38:11.700 --> 38:12.400
Who's that?

38:12.900 --> 38:14.800
Oh, i don't know,a little movie called top--

38:14.900 --> 38:16.800
Top gun.I know, hank.

38:16.900 --> 38:17.600
I'm just joking.

38:17.800 --> 38:20.400
I am aware
of american culture pre-Ipod.

38:21.500 --> 38:22.700
Talk to me, goose.

38:26.300 --> 38:28.100
I didn't realize
you were such a daredevil.

38:28.200 --> 38:30.700
Well, as a hemophiliac,
What choice do i have,you know?

38:31.300 --> 38:33.900
Even slicing an orange can be a deadly stunt.

38:36.800 --> 38:37.900
Didn't dad fire you?

38:38.100 --> 38:38.800
He did.

38:39.200 --> 38:40.300
From being your doctor.

38:41.400 --> 38:42.500
Not from being your friend.

38:45.600 --> 38:46.600
Wanna take it for a spin?

38:46.700 --> 38:48.600
Uh, no.No, thank you.

38:48.700 --> 38:49.300
Fear of flying.

38:51.200 --> 38:51.900
Yeah, me too.

39:04.500 --> 39:05.900
Uh, nice landing, goose.

39:08.200 --> 39:10.100
Hmm, maybe i should've
rented this place.

39:10.600 --> 39:12.200
Sheila was right
about the view.

39:12.300 --> 39:14.200
Yeah, this one's pretty nice.

39:15.000 --> 39:17.500
One of the perks of being a local
Is you know all the best views.

39:17.800 --> 39:18.400
Right.

39:19.500 --> 39:20.400
Were you born here?

39:20.700 --> 39:21.800
Local hamptonite.

39:22.500 --> 39:24.100
Endangered, but not extinct.

39:24.300 --> 39:26.100
Citiots haven't
killed us off yet.

39:26.400 --> 39:28.700
Mm, thank god.
Right, citiots.

39:29.500 --> 39:30.600
Wait, am i a citiot?

39:31.700 --> 39:33.500
I'll grant you temporary
membership to our clan.

39:33.600 --> 39:36.300
-Temporary?What's up with temporary? ??
-Wow.

39:39.800 --> 39:40.700
Thanks for seeing jim.

39:41.200 --> 39:43.000
Yeah, and i'm sorry
about the clinic.

39:43.100 --> 39:44.300
I know how important it was to you.

39:44.800 --> 39:47.500
When i was 12,I was surfing,

39:47.600 --> 39:50.700
And this board tore into my arm.

39:50.700 --> 39:52.300
Nearly separated it
from my shoulder.

39:52.500 --> 39:56.300
And the hospital bills were Way
more than my parents could handle.

39:56.400 --> 39:59.700
But...hamptons heritage
took care of it.

40:00.600 --> 40:01.800
And me, so...

40:02.500 --> 40:04.100
You know, i owe the place so much.

40:04.600 --> 40:06.700
Hmm, that's why
you work at the hospital?

40:06.900 --> 40:08.400
Yeah, i wanted to help
do that for others.

40:08.900 --> 40:09.900
Be a part of something special.

40:10.600 --> 40:13.200
But, you know, it's not
the same place it was.

40:13.800 --> 40:18.100
We have so much less money,
Less staff,less everything.

40:18.400 --> 40:20.100
Hmm.And that explains the clinic.

40:20.300 --> 40:21.200
It's a setback.

40:21.300 --> 40:21.900
That's all.

40:23.400 --> 40:24.200
I don't quit.

40:25.100 --> 40:26.400
You need to know that about me.

40:27.100 --> 40:28.400
Clinic will happen.

40:29.100 --> 40:29.800
I know it will.

40:30.700 --> 40:33.000
And look, in the future,
if there are any...

40:33.600 --> 40:36.200
Sheilas or jims,
you just give them my number.

40:38.700 --> 40:39.700
Guess you can be both.

40:40.300 --> 40:40.900
Both?

40:41.100 --> 40:42.500
Concierge doctor to the rich,

40:42.600 --> 40:44.900
And an on-Call doctor
to the rest of us.

40:45.700 --> 40:46.700
Robin hood of medicine.

40:48.800 --> 40:50.400
As long as no tights are involved.

40:50.500 --> 40:52.600
Why not?You've got nice, strong legs.

40:52.700 --> 40:53.300
Do i, now?

40:54.600 --> 40:55.800

40:56.400 --> 41:00.700
Do you remember anything you said While
you were under the influence The other night?

41:01.000 --> 41:02.300
Not a word.Why?

41:02.900 --> 41:04.400
