- Let's take a seat a second.
- Okay.

01:09:34.800 --> 01:09:36.765
The doctor says yes,

01:09:37.103 --> 01:09:41.000
But we gotta have an important
man-to-man first.

01:09:44.975 --> 01:09:46.999
It's about your mother.

I know how you feel

01:09:54.145 --> 01:09:57.197
but the doctors've had helped
me understand is that...

01:09:57.332 --> 01:10:00.167
It wasn't your mother that was
doing those things at the night.

01:10:00.762 --> 01:10:02.896
Let's say she was sick, Jimmy.

01:10:03.032 --> 01:10:05.418
and the doctor say that with
enough treatment...

01:10:05.598 --> 01:10:07.388
- she's gonna be herself again.
- Dad no,

01:10:07.502 --> 01:10:09.601
Dad they can't let her out.
She'll kill me.

01:10:09.760 --> 01:10:14.836
- She won't stop till I'm dead.
- No son, the court's explained

01:10:14.971 --> 01:10:19.041
and the doctors did too.
It wasn't her that was doing
those things.

01:10:22.482 --> 01:10:30.137
Listen, I know that you might not
wanna hear this right now,

01:10:30.705 --> 01:10:34.905
But when your mother is healthy,
I want her to come home.

01:10:37.233 --> 01:10:41.518
I know it's hard, but I'm only
asking of you Cheif is,

01:10:42.571 --> 01:10:44.096
that's a try.

01:10:45.670 --> 01:10:47.229

survived.

01:11:10.431 --> 01:11:13.120
