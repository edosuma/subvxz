WEBVTT

00:05.070 --> 00:07.500
OK. Lilly, you ready for your first day?

00:07.530 --> 00:09.430
Aye aye, captain. Full speed ahead.

00:10.930 --> 00:13.550
Like a submarine, 'cause we're in a sub shop.

00:15.430 --> 00:16.830
My sandwiches are better than my jokes.

00:17.260 --> 00:19.760
Good. 'Cause you're my first hire as assistant manager

00:19.760 --> 00:21.150
and if you look good, then I look good.

00:21.330 --> 00:22.180
And if you don't look good...

00:22.990 --> 00:24.650
...don't go there, Dwight, don't go there...

00:24.920 --> 00:25.640
...don't go there.

00:27.890 --> 00:29.200
Well, someone looks hungry.

00:29.400 --> 00:30.820
Well I wasn't.

00:30.900 --> 00:34.220
But then I saw that girl over there, and I said to myself

00:34.650 --> 00:39.430
"Self, you want a sandwich made by her."

00:40.030 --> 00:42.470
Well, I only hire the best! Showtime!

00:42.690 --> 00:44.800
Hello, and welcome to The Smiling Sub,

00:44.800 --> 00:46.280
where every order comes with chuckling chips

00:46.340 --> 00:47.910
- and a large giddy gulp. 
 - Nice!

00:49.630 --> 00:52.120
Enjoy your meal.  Don't blow it.

00:52.210 --> 00:54.800
She'll be fine. She'll be fine! She'll be fine.

00:55.550 --> 00:57.710
Oh my gosh, you look so cute! Here...

00:58.140 --> 00:58.910
Say, "Ham and cheese!"

00:58.920 --> 00:59.660
Ham and cheese!

01:01.480 --> 01:02.760
And after a few paychecks

01:02.830 --> 01:04.690
and some generous tips, wink-wink,

01:04.760 --> 01:06.240
you can take one of me and Oliver

01:06.300 --> 01:08.240
buying our brand new used car!

01:10.130 --> 01:11.260
Now, what can I get you, Miss?

01:11.800 --> 01:13.430
I'll have a footlong, toasted,

01:13.530 --> 01:14.960
with roast beef, turkey and provolone,

01:14.960 --> 01:15.690
provolone on top,

01:15.690 --> 01:16.760
mustard and mayo on the bottom,

01:16.760 --> 01:18.280
three shakes salt, half a shake pepper

01:18.360 --> 01:21.240
and some oil and vinegar on the meat, but not on the bun.

01:21.240 --> 01:22.720
I hate when it gets soggy.

01:23.600 --> 01:25.720
What part of "my first day" did you not get?

01:26.560 --> 01:27.330
I'll take a ham and cheese.

01:27.410 --> 01:28.250
Coming right up!

01:29.240 --> 01:31.050
One ham and cheese...

01:31.720 --> 01:33.520
Oh. Oh, no wait,  that's not even.

01:34.160 --> 01:39.360
OK. Alright, lets see. OK.
Closer, but not good enough.

01:40.140 --> 01:41.760
It doesn't have to be perfect.

01:41.760 --> 01:43.800
You know what? You're absolutely right.

01:43.800 --> 01:46.070
But this one is! Oh wait, hang on.

01:47.080 --> 01:48.280
OK, perfect!

01:48.920 --> 01:52.240
Now two slices of ham. One, two...

01:52.240 --> 01:53.920
Oh, hang on, it's hanging over.

01:53.920 --> 01:55.160
Is there anyone else who can help me?

01:55.160 --> 01:56.400
Oh, I'll be right with you.

01:57.290 --> 01:58.910
Come on. You can just shove the ham in there.

01:58.910 --> 02:00.840
Uh, it's not like that in the picture.

02:01.230 --> 02:03.200
You know I'm thinking this may be a defective bun.

02:03.200 --> 02:04.000
Oh, come on!

02:04.000 --> 02:05.880
Hey! Back off. It's her first day.

02:06.560 --> 02:08.560
-Just shove the ham in. 
 -Fine.

02:09.280 --> 02:13.600
OK, two slices of cheese...Oh, that is not right.

02:14.460 --> 02:16.120
My break's almost over.

02:16.120 --> 02:17.360
Let's go!

02:17.360 --> 02:19.560
Uh, what's going on out here?

02:19.560 --> 02:21.040
She's taking forever!

02:21.040 --> 02:22.440
Hey, I told you to back off!

02:22.440 --> 02:23.740
I can handle this, thank you.

02:23.740 --> 02:26.080
She'll be right with you. Just make the sandwich!

02:26.080 --> 02:28.120
OK, fine! I mean, you're the boss!

02:28.120 --> 02:29.640
Who cares what it looks like?

02:29.690 --> 02:32.150
Forget about quality, forget about pride in your work,

02:32.190 --> 02:34.220
just mash it together!

02:34.440 --> 02:36.600
There! There's my  first sandwich.

02:36.600 --> 02:39.480
- Take a picture of that! 
 - Thank you.

02:39.480 --> 02:41.120
No no no! It's hideous!

02:41.440 --> 02:42.710
Don't wrestle with the customer!

02:42.710 --> 02:44.370
It's my first sandwich!

02:48.960 --> 02:50.240
And your last!

02:50.720 --> 02:52.720
But I was saving up for a car.

02:53.200 --> 02:53.760
Fine.

02:56.240 --> 02:57.490
You can keep your tips.

02:59.000 --> 03:05.074

04:04.810 --> 04:07.680
Hey, girls! Lilly, how was your first day on the job?

04:10.660 --> 04:13.940
I mean, I hear you and Oliver 
are saving up to buy a new car.

04:16.920 --> 04:18.250
OK, who wants a ham and cheese?

04:23.560 --> 04:25.870
I'm sorry honey, he came with the house.

04:27.080 --> 04:29.520
Don't worry, we'll get you another job.

04:29.520 --> 04:31.920
I applied for thirty before I got this one.

04:31.920 --> 04:34.960
And the only reason I got it was because my dumb boss

04:34.960 --> 04:38.480
had a grandmother named Lilly and I totally used it.

04:38.760 --> 04:41.120
"Oh, land sake's alive,

04:41.150 --> 04:45.400
aren't you adorable. Here's my application."

04:45.400 --> 04:47.790
Oh! My eyes!

04:49.410 --> 04:50.520
What was that?!

04:50.960 --> 04:53.510
I think the new housekeeper
 just found Jackson's room.

04:54.680 --> 04:55.880
The horror!

04:56.880 --> 04:57.880
The horror!

04:58.920 --> 05:01.720
Aw, c'mon buddy, you were a Navy Seal.

05:01.720 --> 05:04.220
You ain't gonna let a little 
dirt scare ya off, are ya?

05:04.400 --> 05:07.720
I took out my own appendix with a wet wipe,

05:08.080 --> 05:10.150
dental floss and a rusty spoon

05:10.150 --> 05:11.800
and I never shed a tear.

05:12.960 --> 05:14.400
But that room.

05:15.480 --> 05:17.640
I gotta sleep with the lights on tonight.

05:22.220 --> 05:22.960
That's it!

05:23.340 --> 05:27.200
Another brave one bites the dust. This ends now.

05:32.400 --> 05:33.800
There you are.

05:40.570 --> 05:44.320
Oh, sweet filthy flippin' niblets son,

05:44.640 --> 05:46.400
all we need is a tire on a swing

05:46.400 --> 05:49.520
and I could sell tickets to see The Malibu Monkey Boy!

05:50.160 --> 05:51.680
Listen, you're in college now,

05:51.680 --> 05:55.160
it's time to start thinking, acting and living like an adult.

05:58.440 --> 05:59.740
- Jackson?  
 - Oh...

06:00.320 --> 06:01.080
...sorry, Dad.

06:01.640 --> 06:03.320
I was just thinking about how cool it'd be

06:03.320 --> 06:05.720
if I really were half man and half monkey.

06:05.720 --> 06:07.040
I mean, check it out.

06:09.560 --> 06:11.200
I'd have a driver's license,

06:11.720 --> 06:13.790
and I'd be able to drive with my feet!

06:14.600 --> 06:17.050
Hey, you, get out of the way!

06:19.650 --> 06:22.040
You just love to test me, don't you, big guy?

06:28.120 --> 06:31.320
Come on, Dad. We'll find another housekeeper.

06:31.320 --> 06:32.360
Son, that's the fifth one

06:32.360 --> 06:34.460
that's ran screaming out of the house this year!

06:34.720 --> 06:36.590
You think it's so easy, you find one.

06:37.040 --> 06:37.960
I'll do it.

06:38.380 --> 06:39.420
What?

06:40.670 --> 06:42.240
Great, you're hired.

06:42.500 --> 06:43.440
You're welcome.

06:43.640 --> 06:44.800
And you're ugly.

06:46.280 --> 06:48.160
- Dummy say what? 
 - What?

06:48.160 --> 06:49.240
Heh! Dummy.

06:50.040 --> 06:52.360
Are you sure you wanna be a housekeeper?

06:52.450 --> 06:53.880
Well, it's not my first choice,

06:53.880 --> 06:56.360
but if Oliver and I are gonna buy a car, I need a job.

06:56.360 --> 06:56.880
But Lilly,

06:56.890 --> 06:59.200
won't it be a little strange cleaning up after us?

06:59.200 --> 07:01.080
Why not? I mean, I'm here all the time anyway,

07:01.080 --> 07:02.400
I know where everything goes.

07:02.400 --> 07:03.290
It's true.

07:03.600 --> 07:05.400
And Dad, let's face it, I mean,

07:05.920 --> 07:07.800
she's the only housekeeper that we're gonna find

07:07.800 --> 07:09.720
that's already immune to Jackson stank.

07:09.720 --> 07:12.000
See? Her eyes don't even water anymore.

07:13.640 --> 07:15.160
Honey, please don't stir it up!

07:16.800 --> 07:17.760
So, are you cool with it?

07:17.760 --> 07:19.800
Honey, if it gets the sting outta my eyes,

07:19.800 --> 07:21.840
she can have your grandmother's wedding ring.

07:26.750 --> 07:29.600
...yeah, but I really need this job. You know, you see,

07:29.600 --> 07:31.760
Me and my girlfriend are trying to buy a car together and...

07:32.370 --> 07:34.440
OK, well can you put me on the waiting list?

07:35.520 --> 07:37.860
Fantastic! OK, thank you.

07:39.120 --> 07:40.390
How's the job search going?

07:40.450 --> 07:43.200
Great! If 32 people ahead of me all win the lottery,

07:43.200 --> 07:44.500
you're lookin' at the new scooper

07:44.500 --> 07:46.450
trainee at Yippy Yummy Yogurt

07:47.640 --> 07:50.120
Don't worry, buddy. Just keep your eyes open.

07:50.440 --> 07:53.520
You never know when a job will just pop up.

07:54.440 --> 07:58.400
Oh, excuse me while I move
 my New Jackson Wanted sign

07:58.450 --> 08:01.400
to where some lucky potential employee might see it.

08:04.400 --> 08:06.720
Oh, I'm not working for you.

08:06.920 --> 08:07.730
Why not?

08:08.200 --> 08:09.760
For the same reason no one wants to work for you

08:09.760 --> 08:11.590
ever since Jackson quit for college.

08:11.960 --> 08:13.730
Rico, you're a horrible person.

08:13.870 --> 08:15.560
That is so not true.

08:16.140 --> 08:17.120
Excuse me,

08:17.200 --> 08:18.570
I only have 99 cents,

08:18.660 --> 08:20.880
but could I get the dollar bottle of water?

08:21.120 --> 08:23.000
Who do I look like, the water fairy?

08:23.840 --> 08:26.080
You need a penny, sell your hair!

08:29.400 --> 08:33.240
Cute little guy. So, when you wanna start?

08:34.360 --> 08:35.720
Ah, forget it.

08:36.440 --> 08:38.169
But, Oliver, you have to.

08:38.630 --> 08:40.600
If you don't, I'll have to face my girlfriend,

08:40.640 --> 08:42.559
tell her I can't afford my half of the car,

08:42.570 --> 08:44.960
I'm a complete loser and...

08:45.360 --> 08:49.190
Oh, wait, that's not me, that's you.

08:51.160 --> 08:52.920
You're despicable.

08:53.800 --> 08:55.160
Welcome aboard.

09:01.160 --> 09:04.460
Who's the cleanest plant in
 Malibu? You are! Yes, you are!

09:10.590 --> 09:12.290
- Whoa.  
- Oh my gosh.

09:17.200 --> 09:19.840
Lilly, this place looks amazing!

09:19.840 --> 09:20.840
It's OK?

09:20.840 --> 09:22.160
Are you kidding me?

09:22.560 --> 09:26.120
Lulu! She smells so lemony fresh!

09:26.720 --> 09:28.640
And the couch! It doesn't smell so...

09:30.360 --> 09:31.770
...Jacksony ripe!

09:32.650 --> 09:33.800
Lilly, I love you!

09:33.800 --> 09:35.880
Oh, well I'm just doing my job.

09:35.960 --> 09:37.830
Oh, Mr. Stewart, I hope you don't mind,

09:37.830 --> 09:39.040
when I cleaned your bathroom,

09:39.040 --> 09:42.400
I reorganized all your hair products in order of application

09:42.400 --> 09:44.000
from a pre-rinse to shampoo to...

09:44.000 --> 09:45.280
- Volumizing mousse? 
 - Volumizing mousse.

09:45.280 --> 09:46.720
Oh, yeah!

09:47.440 --> 09:48.560
If you ladies will excuse me,

09:48.560 --> 09:49.960
I'm gonna go shampoo now.

09:54.720 --> 09:56.960
I gotta admit, I was kinda worried about the whole thing,

09:56.960 --> 09:58.600
but it's working out perfectly.

10:00.100 --> 10:00.720
What?

10:00.840 --> 10:03.960
Well, it's just that, you know, things look so nice,

10:03.960 --> 10:07.040
and then the purse and the scarf...

10:07.040 --> 10:08.960
No, no. It's fine! It's your house.

10:08.960 --> 10:10.160
You should be comfortable.

10:10.680 --> 10:11.360
Cool.

10:15.160 --> 10:15.960
Now what?

10:16.080 --> 10:17.890
Well, it's just umm...

10:18.190 --> 10:20.390
...you know, the cushions were plumped...

10:20.420 --> 10:21.280
No, you know, it's fine!

10:21.280 --> 10:24.160
I'll just clean it all over again on Thursday.

10:24.520 --> 10:25.900
What happened to "I should be comfortable?"

10:26.790 --> 10:28.120
You're right, I'll stop.

10:29.850 --> 10:31.360
Let me just get those Hannah hairs

10:31.360 --> 10:33.500
before they wind up on my clean rug.

10:35.120 --> 10:38.240
Yeah, that would be tragic.

10:38.680 --> 10:39.560
Oh, yes!

10:44.480 --> 10:45.720
Movie time!

10:55.160 --> 10:56.640
Ooh, butter.

10:58.120 --> 10:59.830
"Ooh, butter" what?

11:01.200 --> 11:05.470
It's just, you know, butter, it's a stain waiting to happen.

11:05.470 --> 11:07.420
A grease stain! Oh, they're the worst.

11:09.400 --> 11:10.340
And I don't care.

11:11.200 --> 11:12.030
Good girl.

11:15.920 --> 11:18.330
Leave extra time to scrub couch.

11:18.410 --> 11:21.200
And clothes I just washed today.

11:21.880 --> 11:24.040
Fine. I won't eat the popcorn.

11:40.880 --> 11:41.880
Happy?

11:47.920 --> 11:49.520
This isn't working!

11:51.520 --> 11:54.960
Well, maybe if you ate in the kitchen like a person.

11:55.870 --> 11:59.720
Look, although you are an unbelievable housekeeper,

11:59.960 --> 12:02.240
maybe Dad was right. Maybe you working for us is kind of,

12:02.550 --> 12:03.480
I don't know, strange.

12:03.500 --> 12:05.160
- Oh, not for me. 
- Really?

12:05.160 --> 12:06.480
- Really. 
- Really?

12:06.540 --> 12:07.800
Unless you have a problem with it.

12:07.800 --> 12:09.760
Because I mean I totally need this job.

12:09.950 --> 12:12.720
No! It's not me.

12:14.800 --> 12:15.840
It's my dad!

12:16.400 --> 12:19.080
He's actually just not as 
happy as he made you think.

12:25.960 --> 12:27.160
Bless you, Lilly.

12:27.360 --> 12:28.880
He's way happier.

12:34.440 --> 12:35.840
I mean look at this!

12:36.080 --> 12:39.760
I forgot he even had a floor! And this chair!

12:39.760 --> 12:41.680
I thought we lost it in the move.

12:42.680 --> 12:44.490
Yeah, I didn't even see it at first, either.

12:44.490 --> 12:46.040
I mean it was buried under pizza so old

12:46.040 --> 12:48.120
there were mushrooms growing out of the mushrooms.

12:48.800 --> 12:50.920
Lilly Truscott, I'm giving you a raise!

12:50.920 --> 12:51.960
Thank you, Mr. Stewart!

12:51.960 --> 12:54.600
Uh, new car here I come! Isn't that great, Miley?

12:54.600 --> 12:56.000
Super!

12:59.610 --> 13:01.050
My room!

13:01.080 --> 13:02.820
Oh, you're welcome.

13:02.850 --> 13:04.990
For what? It's horrible!

13:05.340 --> 13:07.850
Where's my petrifiedsweat sock sculpture?

13:08.460 --> 13:10.190
Where's Mashed Potato Mountain?

13:10.580 --> 13:13.660
Where's... Hey, I thought we lost that chair in the move.

13:14.800 --> 13:16.100
Hey, you got any advice

13:16.100 --> 13:18.380
for getting the burnt crusty pork off my barbecue?

13:18.380 --> 13:19.600
- Too late! 
 - You didn't.

13:19.600 --> 13:20.500
I did!

13:20.705 --> 13:23.020
Yeah. She probably even dusted the charcoal.

13:23.020 --> 13:25.310
I even dusted the charcoal! Come see!

13:25.840 --> 13:27.070
I'm gettin' my camera!

13:27.110 --> 13:28.460
- I cleaned the lens! 
 - You didn't!

13:28.460 --> 13:29.940
- I did!   
- Oh!

13:31.020 --> 13:33.060
Socks in drawers,

13:34.460 --> 13:37.500
shirts on hangers, it's madness!

13:37.500 --> 13:39.140
I can't live like this.

13:39.540 --> 13:42.110
That neat freak has to go!

13:43.160 --> 13:46.890
You know, I don't really want
to say this but, you're right.

13:47.380 --> 13:52.100
Ow, that actually hurt. But she does need a job.

13:52.180 --> 13:54.170
So just get her her old job back.

13:54.200 --> 13:55.380
Yeah, like I could...

13:56.370 --> 13:59.680
Actually, Jackson, that's a great idea.

14:00.140 --> 14:02.480
Ow, two in a row.

14:07.420 --> 14:10.360
Here you go and thank you for choosing Rico's.

14:12.350 --> 14:14.990
Three cheers for the generous tipper! Hip-hip...

14:15.020 --> 14:16.760
- Hey-o! 
 - Hip-hip...

14:16.790 --> 14:18.660
- Hey-o!  
 - What are you doing?

14:18.660 --> 14:20.260
Oh, we're cheering on the tipper.

14:20.260 --> 14:21.860
It's a crowd pleaser. Watch this.

14:21.860 --> 14:22.600
Hip-hip...

14:22.630 --> 14:24.030
Hey-o!

14:25.380 --> 14:26.680
You see that?

14:29.740 --> 14:31.040
OK, first,

14:31.070 --> 14:36.080
I own the exclusive North American rights to the "hey-o!"

14:37.180 --> 14:39.110
Second, why are you happy?

14:39.180 --> 14:42.460
You're not supposed to be happy! You work for me!

14:43.220 --> 14:45.660
You know what? It's not so bad.

14:46.220 --> 14:48.980
I mean I'm on the beach all day, everyone's friendly,

14:49.120 --> 14:51.130
and every hour that I'm working for you,

14:51.340 --> 14:53.620
I'm an hour closer to getting my new car.

14:55.100 --> 14:57.180
I don't like your attitude, mister.

14:58.870 --> 15:01.340
Jackson was miserable every minute he was here

15:01.340 --> 15:02.580
and I loved it.

15:02.770 --> 15:06.300
Oh, seeing his pain was like waking up on Christmas morning

15:06.300 --> 15:08.660
to find all those presents under the tree.

15:09.110 --> 15:10.580
Where are my presents?!

15:10.610 --> 15:11.780
I want my presents!

15:11.810 --> 15:13.140
I don't know!

15:13.140 --> 15:17.860
Sorry to disappoint you man, but I like this job.

15:17.910 --> 15:20.500
Oh, we'll see about that!

15:20.592 --> 15:22.780
Because I will have my Christmas morning!

15:26.730 --> 15:28.530
I own that, too.

15:31.830 --> 15:34.230
Oh, you missed some bird poop over there.

15:34.270 --> 15:36.870
Oh, cool. Hey, thanks Rico.

15:39.170 --> 15:42.980
Oh, come on! What can you possibly like about this?

15:44.140 --> 15:46.700
I can see Lilly cleaning the Stewart's house from here.

15:46.780 --> 15:51.740
Hey, Lilly! She saw me! She saw me!

15:52.340 --> 15:53.660
She saw me!

15:53.660 --> 15:55.920
She did! She did! She's right there.

15:55.920 --> 15:57.700
I was mocking you!

15:57.990 --> 16:01.510
I know! And you're cute when you're mad!

16:02.500 --> 16:05.470
Well, I'm about to get adorable!

16:10.460 --> 16:13.240
Come to Rico's for good food

16:13.900 --> 16:16.540
It will brighten up your mood

16:16.588 --> 16:19.300
And if you think that I'm a fool

16:19.300 --> 16:22.180
Please tell everyone at school

16:27.820 --> 16:29.720
Why are you still happy?

16:29.760 --> 16:33.130
You're dressed as a penguin,  you're sweating like a pig.

16:33.160 --> 16:34.380
You should be miserable!

16:34.380 --> 16:35.600
Miserable?

16:35.730 --> 16:37.330
Dude, I just lost the last three pounds

16:37.330 --> 16:39.630
I needed to get in my skinny jeans.

16:40.740 --> 16:44.260
Now, when I say "foxy"  you 
say "penguin!" Foxy!

16:44.260 --> 16:45.660
- Penguin! 
 - Foxy!

16:45.670 --> 16:47.340
- Penguin!
 - Stop it!

16:51.050 --> 16:55.900
- Foxy! 
- Penguin!

16:59.284 --> 17:00.660
Enjoy your meal.

17:07.780 --> 17:10.000
Uh, excuse me, sir. What are you doing?

17:10.030 --> 17:12.780
Sorry pal, this shop is closed.

17:14.900 --> 17:18.140
Here, why don't you go next door and get yourself

17:18.140 --> 17:21.609
a nice soup in a sourdough bowl.

17:21.900 --> 17:24.099
And if you hear any screaming

17:24.099 --> 17:26.380
emanating from this establishment,

17:26.540 --> 17:28.220
just eat your soup.

17:29.780 --> 17:31.830
Hey! That was my...

17:32.390 --> 17:33.410
But I could...

17:33.960 --> 17:34.910
I just...

17:37.940 --> 17:40.790
Yo, Adrian. We're good to go.

17:41.830 --> 17:43.560
Thanks, Fredo.

17:45.300 --> 17:48.370
Hello, Dwight. How you doin'?

17:48.400 --> 17:49.740
Do I know you?

17:49.770 --> 17:52.420
No, but I know youse.

17:52.840 --> 17:54.680
You are the deeply confused young man

17:54.710 --> 17:57.410
who mistakenly fired my little girl.

17:58.380 --> 18:00.710
Fredo, help our friend sit down.

18:02.180 --> 18:03.950
You're Lilly Truscott's mom?

18:03.990 --> 18:06.540
Incorrect, my friend.

18:07.820 --> 18:09.220
I'm her godmother.

18:11.360 --> 18:12.380
Not yet.

18:12.620 --> 18:14.930
You sure? That felt like the right place to throw that...

18:14.960 --> 18:16.930
- Fredo!  
- Sorry, boss.

18:18.430 --> 18:20.460
He's one layer short of a lasagna

18:20.460 --> 18:21.870
if you know what I'm sayin'.

18:22.860 --> 18:24.340
Yeah, lasagna, that's good.

18:24.340 --> 18:25.570
That wasn't a joke.

18:25.610 --> 18:27.110
Sorry.

18:27.140 --> 18:28.820
Do I amuse you?

18:29.820 --> 18:32.980
Do you think of me as some kind of clown?

18:32.980 --> 18:35.920
Please don't hurt me, please don't hurt me...

18:35.950 --> 18:40.050
Relax, Dwight, there's no need to get hurt here.

18:40.090 --> 18:44.620
All you gotta do's is call Lilly 
and offer her her job back.

18:44.660 --> 18:46.360
But I'm not sure I can do that.

18:46.390 --> 18:48.300
Listen, I got a question for youse.

18:48.700 --> 18:50.330
Are you fond of your kneecaps?

18:51.700 --> 18:54.200
I said are you fond of your kneecaps?

18:54.240 --> 18:55.250
Sorry.

18:57.940 --> 19:00.940
My sister's kid. What are you gonna do?

19:01.910 --> 19:04.010
So, what's it gonna be?

19:04.050 --> 19:08.580
Lilly here or you taking a little walk with Fredo?

19:10.080 --> 19:11.250
Lilly?

19:12.250 --> 19:13.390
Good kid.

19:13.420 --> 19:15.160
Now you go call that girl

19:15.190 --> 19:17.580
and make her an offer that she can't refuse.

19:17.860 --> 19:21.860
And remembers, we were never here.

19:21.900 --> 19:24.000
- Never.  
- OK.

19:25.860 --> 19:27.020
Badda bing?

19:27.020 --> 19:28.260
Badda boom.

19:28.470 --> 19:30.690
- Miley?
  - Badda busted.

19:31.500 --> 19:32.460
What are you guys doing here?

19:32.460 --> 19:33.840
Just getting a sandwich.

19:34.580 --> 19:35.800
Dressed like that?

19:35.880 --> 19:38.260
Uh, I just came back from my uh...

19:38.900 --> 19:39.780
Uh, video shoot.

19:39.780 --> 19:42.220

Called uh...

19:45.050 --> 19:46.420
Mobster Mama!

19:47.540 --> 19:49.220
Yeah, it's super cool.

19:49.460 --> 19:50.220
You should hear it.

19:50.220 --> 19:51.390
Why don't you sing her a little?

19:54.700 --> 19:56.500
I'm a mobster mama

19:56.530 --> 19:59.000
She's mean, she's tough She's a monster mama

19:59.030 --> 20:01.660
Don't make me get rough 'cause I can do my stuff

20:02.300 --> 20:03.660
Like Julianne Hough, hey!

20:03.660 --> 20:04.540
Break it down!

20:04.780 --> 20:06.700
Miley.

20:09.740 --> 20:11.080
Fine.

20:12.860 --> 20:16.780
The truth is... Dad was right.

20:17.580 --> 20:19.620
Having you work for us was a little ookie

20:19.650 --> 20:22.020
and we were just trying to get your job back.

20:22.140 --> 20:24.300
You're kidding! I came down here to get my job back

20:24.300 --> 20:25.700
'cause I felt the same way.

20:25.700 --> 20:27.020
Why didn't you tell me?

20:27.020 --> 20:30.730
I didn't want to hurt you. Really? Aw.

20:30.770 --> 20:32.930
Oh. This is so sweet

20:32.970 --> 20:36.800
it reminds me of my favorite  
episode of <i>My Name is Hurl</i>.

20:39.210 --> 20:41.410
Well, I guess I better go try and get my job back.

20:41.440 --> 20:42.580
Oh, nope!

20:43.420 --> 20:45.080
That's already taken care of.

20:45.110 --> 20:47.260
And, think you're even gettin' a raise.

20:47.308 --> 20:49.650
- Really?  
 - Yo, Dwight!

20:49.680 --> 20:52.090
And I think you should give the girl a raise!

20:52.120 --> 20:53.950
Yes, Godmother!

20:53.990 --> 20:57.060
- Good boy!  
 - Thank you, Miley.

20:57.090 --> 20:59.590
Oh, you know what? I better call your dad.

20:59.630 --> 21:00.700
I'm already on it.

21:01.630 --> 21:03.130
I'm sure he'll be fine.

21:03.130 --> 21:04.820
He's a big boy. He can take care of himself.

21:05.300 --> 21:09.440
No, Jackson, no! She can't do this to me!

21:09.470 --> 21:12.980
Please, please, please, please!

21:18.220 --> 21:20.750
And it smells so fresh!

21:27.870 --> 21:30.500
Come on dude it's not so bad

21:30.500 --> 21:33.020
Just 'cause you can't make me mad

21:34.500 --> 21:38.020
Jump in Rico sing along Join me in my jolly...

21:38.020 --> 21:39.100
Enough!

21:40.140 --> 21:43.220
You win. Your happiness has broken me.

21:43.660 --> 21:45.140
Now get out of my sight.

21:45.490 --> 21:47.660
Go back to your stupid girlfriend.

21:49.860 --> 21:51.730
What did you call Lilly?

21:52.100 --> 21:53.430
Stupid.

21:55.470 --> 21:58.620
A dumb, pathetic...

21:59.440 --> 22:02.070
...squeaky voiced loser.

22:03.270 --> 22:05.900
Nobody talks about my Lillypop like that!

22:06.221 --> 22:09.940
- Come here!   
- Dopey! Stinky!

22:10.540 --> 22:12.020
Whiny!

22:12.050 --> 22:14.300
That's it! When I get my hands on you!

22:14.371 --> 22:19.380
Yes! I'm being chased by an
 angry penguin employee!
