WEBVTT

00:01.667 --> 00:03.583
[instrumental music]

00:10.875 --> 00:14.000
Ivanova, good.
I was just about to call you.

00:14.083 --> 00:15.625
I've been going over
these reports

00:15.708 --> 00:18.042
trying to figure out how
we're going to get along with

00:18.125 --> 00:20.792
all our supply shipments from
Earth cut off by the embargo.

00:22.708 --> 00:24.750
We've got two, maybe
three months of reserves.

00:24.833 --> 00:27.167
Then we are going to start
running out of things.

00:27.250 --> 00:30.708
'Small things at first,
but then more important things.'

00:30.792 --> 00:33.292
Something breaks,
we may not be able to fix it.

00:33.375 --> 00:35.792
And you can forget the spare
parts for the fighters.

00:35.875 --> 00:38.583
Well, we can go black market
if we have to.

00:38.667 --> 00:40.042
We will.

00:40.125 --> 00:42.083
Even that's gonna be tough.

00:42.167 --> 00:43.792
The black market survives
only so long

00:43.875 --> 00:46.042
as the money outweighs the risk.

00:46.125 --> 00:47.458
Now, with imprisonment
for anyone

00:47.542 --> 00:49.042
caught bringing supplies here--

00:49.125 --> 00:51.458
I'll start lining it up.

00:51.542 --> 00:52.917
Are you sure?

00:53.000 --> 00:54.708
The type of people
you'll be dealing with are--

00:54.792 --> 00:56.250
(Susan)
'I'm looking forward to it.'

00:56.333 --> 00:58.250
It'll keep your hands clean,
give you deniability

00:58.333 --> 00:59.917
and take some of the weight
off your shoulders.

01:00.000 --> 01:01.417
I appreciate it, thanks.

01:01.500 --> 01:03.625
and speaking of which..

01:03.708 --> 01:05.708
...as of now I'm relieving you
of command.

01:10.542 --> 01:11.958
Ivanova, your sense of humor

01:12.042 --> 01:14.792
has always been on the edge
of good taste, but--

01:14.875 --> 01:16.833
I'm serious, John.

01:16.917 --> 01:18.500
On what grounds?

01:18.583 --> 01:21.542
You haven't taken any personal
time in over nine months.

01:21.625 --> 01:25.500
And in that time, we have broken
away from Earth, fought a war

01:25.583 --> 01:27.333
you've been declared dead
at least once

01:27.417 --> 01:28.542
and you know how tiring
that could be.

01:28.625 --> 01:30.208
- Ivanova--
- 'Be sensible.'

01:30.292 --> 01:32.000
We still have Earth to deal
with, we can't do that

01:32.083 --> 01:33.375
until all our pieces
are in place

01:33.458 --> 01:35.667
so just take a day or two
for yourself.

01:35.750 --> 01:39.333
You may not get another break
for a long time.

01:39.417 --> 01:41.500
There isn't much chance of me
winning this argument, is there?

01:41.583 --> 01:44.167
None whatsoever.
I never give up when I'm right.

01:44.250 --> 01:46.333
Your only option is surrender.

01:46.417 --> 01:48.625
Who taught you
to negotiate like that?

01:48.708 --> 01:50.792
- You did.
- Oh.

01:53.833 --> 01:56.250
Well, then I assume this
enforced vacation

01:56.333 --> 01:57.917
is to begin immediately?

01:58.000 --> 02:00.833
It started when I walked in
that door.

02:00.917 --> 02:03.000
Ah.

02:03.083 --> 02:06.458
Oh, uh, any word from Franklin
or Marcus?

02:06.542 --> 02:08.542
No, they were only supposed
to break communications

02:08.625 --> 02:10.833
after making contact
with the Resistance.

02:10.917 --> 02:12.583
They should be almost
to Mars by now.

02:12.667 --> 02:13.708
Yeah.

02:16.042 --> 02:17.250
- I--
- Ahem.

02:22.792 --> 02:23.792
Tsk.

02:28.375 --> 02:29.917
(Marcus)
'Seven sisters.'

02:30.792 --> 02:31.833
'Saturn.'

02:35.375 --> 02:37.333
Side of the ship.

02:40.625 --> 02:41.792
Stars.

02:45.375 --> 02:48.167
Well, that was easy. My turn.

02:48.250 --> 02:50.583
Best of five.

02:50.667 --> 02:53.500
I spy with my little eye..

02:55.083 --> 02:57.000
...something beginning with B.

02:57.083 --> 02:58.625
- Boxes.
- Right.

03:00.083 --> 03:02.750
I spy with my little eye
something beginning with M.

03:02.833 --> 03:04.583
- More boxes.
- Two in a row.

03:04.667 --> 03:06.500
"And that's when I shot him,
Your Honor."

03:06.583 --> 03:09.750
I spy with my little eye
something beginning with E.

03:09.833 --> 03:11.833
- I, I-I give up.
- Oh, come on.

03:13.000 --> 03:15.000
This better not be what I..

03:15.083 --> 03:16.625
- Even more boxes.
- Even more boxes.

03:16.708 --> 03:19.750
Look, Marcus, look, you know,
don't misunderstand me, alright?

03:19.833 --> 03:21.375
You're a nice guy. I like you.

03:21.458 --> 03:23.708
I-I-I respect you, but after
being cooped up

03:23.792 --> 03:25.792
for two weeks with you
I'm about ready to..

03:29.000 --> 03:30.958
And I really hate
when you do that!

03:31.667 --> 03:33.167
[man groaning]

03:36.375 --> 03:40.042
It would appear we have a spy
on our hands, Stephen.

03:45.917 --> 03:48.625
[instrumental music]

03:48.708 --> 03:50.625
(Lennier)
It was the year of fire.

03:50.708 --> 03:52.542
(Zack)
The year of destruction.

03:52.625 --> 03:55.458
(G'kar)
The year we took back
what was ours.

03:55.542 --> 03:57.125
(Lyta)
It was the year of rebirth.

03:57.208 --> 03:59.708
(Vir)
The year of great sadness.

03:59.792 --> 04:01.375
(Marcus)
The year of pain.

04:01.458 --> 04:02.875
(Delenn)
And a year of joy.

04:02.958 --> 04:04.708
(Londo)
It was a new age.

04:04.792 --> 04:06.583
(Franklin)
It was the end of history.

04:06.667 --> 04:09.250
(Ivanova)
It was the year
everything changed.

04:12.083 --> 04:16.083
(Garibaldi)
The year is 2261.
The place..

04:16.167 --> 04:17.250
(Sheridan)
Babylon 5.

04:17.333 --> 04:20.375
[theme music]

04:47.292 --> 04:50.375
[music continues]

05:18.542 --> 05:20.625
Alright, who are you
and where did you come from?

05:20.708 --> 05:23.042
Uh, there's an access panel
behind the hold

05:23.125 --> 05:24.458
over there on that side.

05:24.542 --> 05:26.208
I checked it
when we came through.

05:26.292 --> 05:29.083
- It was locked.
- I've got the key.

05:29.167 --> 05:30.875
The pilot's my brother.

05:30.958 --> 05:32.833
He lets me travel around
with him.

05:32.917 --> 05:34.375
You know, do a little business.

05:34.458 --> 05:37.333
None of those damned transit
forms to fill out.

05:37.417 --> 05:39.583
Why didn't he tell us about you?

05:39.667 --> 05:41.458
Probably forgot.

05:41.542 --> 05:43.708
I get forgotten so many times..

05:43.792 --> 05:45.833
Well, I forget.

05:48.375 --> 05:51.000
[breathing heavily]

05:51.083 --> 05:53.250
Your friend's fast.

05:53.333 --> 05:56.458
Got right up behind me.
Never even heard him.

05:56.542 --> 05:59.375
Me, I, I'm built
for endurance, with

05:59.458 --> 06:01.917
pleasures of the mind,
pleasures of the body.

06:02.000 --> 06:02.958
[chuckling]

06:03.042 --> 06:05.458
My name's John Demeter, uh..

06:05.542 --> 06:07.750
But most everybody calls me
Captain Jack.

06:07.833 --> 06:08.917
[laughing]

06:09.000 --> 06:11.458
- And you are..
- Passing through.

06:12.625 --> 06:14.750
(Marcus)
'Look, I'll tell you what.'

06:16.417 --> 06:19.125
- You see these boxes here?
- Right.

06:19.208 --> 06:22.708
Pretend there's
a very large dragon

06:22.792 --> 06:24.958
on the other side
of the cargo hold.

06:25.042 --> 06:28.583
And if you pass this point..

06:28.667 --> 06:31.042
...it will eat you.

06:31.125 --> 06:34.167
You stay on your side
and we'll stay on ours.

06:36.417 --> 06:38.750
Right. Well, as you say.

06:38.833 --> 06:41.958
Far from friendly,
but that's no concern of mine.

06:42.042 --> 06:44.667
No, uh-uh, Captain Jack
is not the sort to

06:44.750 --> 06:47.542
push himself on others
when he's not wanted.

06:47.625 --> 06:49.875
'I was just gonna offer
to share my dinner with you.'

06:49.958 --> 06:53.208
You know, brothers
of the great space highway

06:53.292 --> 06:55.750
have gotta stick together.

06:55.833 --> 06:58.000
We have our own dinner,
thank you.

06:58.083 --> 07:00.292
Oh, yes, so I see.

07:00.375 --> 07:02.333
Meal bars, is it?

07:02.417 --> 07:06.375
Kind of dry, nasty,
kind of mealy things.

07:06.458 --> 07:09.833
Chew 'em all day,
still taste like sand.

07:09.917 --> 07:12.750
Me, I go for insta-heats.

07:14.500 --> 07:16.000
Oh-oh-oh.

07:18.875 --> 07:21.083
- That's beef and potatoes.
- 'Yeah.'

07:21.167 --> 07:24.750
The least of my inventory.
A tiny taste of home.

07:24.833 --> 07:28.167
I deal in wonders
and sensualities.

07:28.250 --> 07:30.792
A thousand delicacies
from a 100 worlds.

07:30.875 --> 07:35.750
As I said, pleasures of the
mind, pleasures of the body.

07:35.833 --> 07:36.792
Come along, Stephen.

07:36.875 --> 07:38.458
Well, now,
we don't wanna be rude.

07:43.042 --> 07:44.458
No contact, remember?

07:50.958 --> 07:55.042
(automated response)
'Entertainment channel
unavailable due to jamming.'

07:55.125 --> 07:58.750
'Movie channel unavailable
due to jamming.'

07:58.833 --> 08:02.750
'Sports channel unavailable
due to jamming.'

08:02.833 --> 08:06.708
'Adult channel unavailable
due to jamming.'

08:06.792 --> 08:08.958
'ISN available.'

08:09.042 --> 08:10.667
(man on TV)
'As we continue the rebroadcast'

08:10.750 --> 08:13.708
'of our story covering recent
events aboard Babylon 5'

08:13.792 --> 08:17.792
'for all our friends and viewers
in Grid Epsilon.'

08:17.875 --> 08:20.208
Look, don't get me wrong.
I like Sheridan.

08:20.292 --> 08:23.000
He's, I don't know,
he's just different

08:23.083 --> 08:25.333
since he got back
from alien space.

08:25.417 --> 08:28.417
You know, sometimes he thinks
he's the Second Coming.

08:28.500 --> 08:30.708
'He's..
He-he has like a God complex.'

08:30.792 --> 08:32.292
You can't talk to him anymore.'

08:32.375 --> 08:33.583
'He doesn't listen.'

08:33.667 --> 08:35.083
'Well, that's-that's not true.'

08:35.167 --> 08:37.583
'He, he listens to Delenn,
this other alien Lorien'

08:37.667 --> 08:40.625
'who was here for a while,
maybe a few others.'

08:40.708 --> 08:43.583
'I just wasn't comfortable
with the situation anymore.'

08:43.667 --> 08:44.958
'You know, he,
he thinks he knows'

08:45.042 --> 08:46.417
'what's best
for everybody else.'

08:46.500 --> 08:50.250
'Now, maybe that goes with being
a CO, but this, I..'

08:50.333 --> 08:51.417
[Michael sighing]

08:51.500 --> 08:54.167
'I just think he's gone
over the top.'

08:54.250 --> 08:56.583
(man on TV)
'You think you'll get into
trouble for saying this?'

08:58.792 --> 09:00.958
(Michael)
'Yeah, probably.'

09:01.042 --> 09:03.208
But somebody's
gotta say something.

09:09.500 --> 09:13.042
- Michael, you got a minute?
- Yeah, make it quick.

09:14.333 --> 09:16.167
I've been meaning to talk to you
about something.

09:16.250 --> 09:17.625
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
the ISN interview.

09:17.708 --> 09:19.083
Look, captain,
I don't work for you anymore.

09:19.167 --> 09:20.958
I know and I supported
your decision, but..

09:21.042 --> 09:22.417
Yeah, but now
you don't like it because

09:22.500 --> 09:25.292
I'm challenging
your authority, right?

09:25.375 --> 09:27.958
There's a difference between
challenging and undermining.

09:28.042 --> 09:30.833
- Now your opinion is--
- My opinion. I'm entitled.

09:30.917 --> 09:32.292
You know, I thought free speech
was one of the things

09:32.375 --> 09:34.250
you were supposed
to be fighting for.

09:34.333 --> 09:36.125
I'm just trying to find out
where all this anger

09:36.208 --> 09:37.500
is coming from.

09:37.583 --> 09:38.833
I thought we were friends.

09:38.917 --> 09:41.542
Yeah, well,
maybe we both thought wrong.

09:42.958 --> 09:45.083
Michael, we've got everything
on the line right now.

09:45.167 --> 09:47.833
Clark's propaganda is doing
a good enough job of smearing us

09:47.917 --> 09:51.042
without one of us
giving it credibility.

09:51.125 --> 09:53.500
'Now, what you said about me,
I really don't care.'

09:53.583 --> 09:56.542
But you're damaging the cause
and hurting the station.

09:56.625 --> 09:58.292
It wouldn't be so bad
if I at least understood it

09:58.375 --> 09:59.625
but I don't.

09:59.708 --> 10:02.333
If I did something to,
to upset you, I--

10:02.417 --> 10:03.500
Look, it would take
too long to explain

10:03.583 --> 10:04.958
and I don't have the time.

10:05.042 --> 10:06.375
You see, I'm meeting a client
in a few minutes

10:06.458 --> 10:07.750
and he doesn't like
authority figures

10:07.833 --> 10:09.375
whether there are in
or out of uniform.

10:09.458 --> 10:11.083
So why don't you go back
to playing God

10:11.167 --> 10:14.292
and let the rest of us mere
mortals, get back to business?

10:16.250 --> 10:18.667
Alright, if that's the way
you want it, fine.

10:18.750 --> 10:19.833
I don't know
what's gotten into you

10:19.917 --> 10:21.500
but it's not my problem anymore.

10:21.583 --> 10:23.125
I've got a job to do.

10:23.208 --> 10:26.375
And I can't let anyone interfere
with that, not even you.

10:26.458 --> 10:29.042
Now, privately you think
what you want, but publicly

10:29.125 --> 10:31.542
I don't want to hear
this stuff anymore.

10:31.625 --> 10:33.042
Otherwise I'm gonna
have to make things

10:33.125 --> 10:34.417
difficult for you around here.

10:34.500 --> 10:36.208
I don't want to have to do that,
but I will.

10:36.292 --> 10:37.708
Don't threaten me, Sheridan.

10:37.792 --> 10:39.417
I'm a private citizen now.

10:39.500 --> 10:42.208
(John)
'With an obligation to keep
the oath you gave me'

10:42.292 --> 10:44.958
and Ivanova and the Alliance.

10:45.042 --> 10:46.875
You held a position
of authority here.

10:46.958 --> 10:49.458
Because of that people
took stock in what you say.

10:49.542 --> 10:51.000
You broke that trust!

10:51.083 --> 10:52.792
'You knew what was at stake
with that interview'

10:52.875 --> 10:55.375
and you deliberately gave aid
and comfort to the enemy

10:55.458 --> 10:56.833
in front of a billion people.

10:56.917 --> 10:59.167
A little criticism, and all the
universe starts falling.

10:59.250 --> 11:01.250
Enough!

11:01.333 --> 11:03.833
Now, if you've got a legitimate
complaint, you make it!

11:03.917 --> 11:07.708
But if it's a personal attack in
disguise, it stops right here.

11:07.792 --> 11:09.250
Hey, I didn't make
this personal.

11:09.333 --> 11:10.542
You did that all by yourself.

11:10.625 --> 11:11.583
What are you talking about?

11:11.667 --> 11:13.000
The people who work for you

11:13.083 --> 11:14.708
they're not following the cause,
they're following you.

11:14.792 --> 11:15.750
Did you ever hear
of a little thing

11:15.833 --> 11:17.250
called the cult of personality?

11:17.333 --> 11:19.458
Well, it's not about us, it's
not about doing what's right

11:19.542 --> 11:21.292
it's about how you're
fulfilling prophecy.

11:21.375 --> 11:23.250
How you went to Z'Ha'Dum
and came back alive.

11:23.333 --> 11:24.792
Hell, you even came back
from the dead.

11:24.875 --> 11:27.042
Could we possibly get any more
messianic than that?

11:27.125 --> 11:28.583
You know what
the real problem is?

11:28.667 --> 11:30.542
It's that you're starting to buy
into your publicity.

11:30.625 --> 11:31.917
And maybe, just maybe it's time

11:32.000 --> 11:33.667
that somebody punches
a hole in that.

11:35.667 --> 11:37.875
- Someone like you?
- Yeah.

11:39.750 --> 11:41.000
I don't buy it.

11:41.083 --> 11:43.417
It's just a cheap excuse
for crummy behavior.

11:43.500 --> 11:45.875
Bottom line is you're misusing
your authority

11:45.958 --> 11:47.333
and I won't have it.

11:47.417 --> 11:49.708
You want to be mad at me,
fine, you be mad at me!

11:49.792 --> 11:52.250
But don't hurt everyone else
just to get at me!

11:57.083 --> 12:00.167
[instrumental music]

12:13.833 --> 12:17.958
Would you like me to tell you
in explicit medical terminology

12:18.042 --> 12:20.875
exactly what this tastes like?

12:20.958 --> 12:23.625
Now, what have we got here?

12:23.708 --> 12:25.750
Beef stroganoff. Oh.

12:25.833 --> 12:28.667
[inhaling]
What a delicious aroma.

12:28.750 --> 12:32.625
We stay clear of everyone
until we meet our contact.

12:32.708 --> 12:34.667
Then we can verify
the pass phrase, we can--

12:34.750 --> 12:39.208
(John)
'Lyta had a little Vorlon,
her skin was pale as snow.'

12:39.292 --> 12:43.208
'And everywhere that Lyta went,
her Vorlon was sure to go.'

12:48.083 --> 12:49.292
[chuckling]

12:49.375 --> 12:51.500
Why didn't you just say that
in the first place?

12:51.583 --> 12:53.833
I wanted to check you out first.

12:53.917 --> 12:55.667
Captain Jack hasn't lived
this long

12:55.750 --> 12:57.292
by being stupid, now, has he?

12:57.375 --> 12:59.833
Go on, have a seat,
help yourself.

12:59.917 --> 13:02.458
I got your new Identicards
here somewhere.

13:02.542 --> 13:05.292
- Ouch.
- 'Careful now, that's hot.'

13:05.375 --> 13:07.750
It's a good job, really.

13:07.833 --> 13:12.125
I get to handle first contacts
for the underground and, uh

13:12.208 --> 13:14.708
well, they let me ride for free.

13:14.792 --> 13:17.375
I can bring in anything I like.

13:17.458 --> 13:19.583
Uh, well, here we go.

13:19.667 --> 13:20.708
Ah.

13:20.792 --> 13:23.458
Now, there's just one thing.

13:23.542 --> 13:27.417
We don't usually have people
coming through here in pairs.

13:27.500 --> 13:31.708
Most of the Resistance
travel light, travel alone.

13:31.792 --> 13:34.583
So to get travel permits
for the two of you together..

13:34.667 --> 13:37.500
Well, our access to the Transit
Bureau is limited

13:37.583 --> 13:40.583
to whatever we can steal.

13:40.667 --> 13:41.625
[chuckling]

13:41.708 --> 13:44.500
So you're Jim Fennerman

13:45.417 --> 13:48.375
'and you're Daniel Lane.'

13:48.458 --> 13:51.375
A young married couple
on holiday to Mars

13:51.458 --> 13:52.542
for their honeymoon.

13:52.625 --> 13:54.417
[Captain Jack chuckling]

13:54.500 --> 13:56.542
(male announcer)
'Attention, all passengers'

13:56.625 --> 13:58.917
'we are about to enter
Mars' orbit.'

13:59.000 --> 14:00.917
'Please stand by to disembark.'

14:07.875 --> 14:09.208
Well, shall we go, darling?

14:13.625 --> 14:16.667
[instrumental music]

14:28.500 --> 14:29.667
(male #1)
'Evening.'

14:31.083 --> 14:32.417
Thought we might have a word
about you

14:32.500 --> 14:34.875
and your former friend
Captain Sheridan.

14:34.958 --> 14:36.542
'Couldn't help but notice
earlier you and he'

14:36.625 --> 14:38.167
'aren't exactly getting on.'

14:38.250 --> 14:39.583
What's it to you?

14:39.667 --> 14:41.458
I thought you might like to know
there are other people

14:41.542 --> 14:43.083
who feel the same way you do.

14:43.167 --> 14:45.417
'Who aren't exactly thrilled
about one of our own'

14:45.500 --> 14:47.458
'turning against Earth.'

14:47.542 --> 14:48.583
'It's no good.'

14:48.667 --> 14:50.375
It's no good for business.

14:50.458 --> 14:52.958
For the president.
It's not good for anyone.

14:53.042 --> 14:54.292
So I thought
we could have a word

14:54.375 --> 14:56.042
see what else we might
have in common.

14:56.125 --> 14:59.167
I mean, besides the both of us
sleeping with your sister?

14:59.250 --> 15:02.042
You can do better than that,
Garibaldi, I know you can

15:02.125 --> 15:05.167
'cause my information on you
is very extensive.

15:05.250 --> 15:06.917
Which leads me to wonder

15:07.000 --> 15:09.375
'are your objections
only halfhearted'

15:09.458 --> 15:11.125
more form than substance?

15:11.208 --> 15:12.875
Well, you wonder all you want.

15:12.958 --> 15:15.250
I got places to be.

15:16.583 --> 15:18.667
There is, uh, one other thing

15:18.750 --> 15:20.583
that you might wanna
consider, Mr. Garibaldi

15:20.667 --> 15:24.208
and that is,
a man can become a threat

15:24.292 --> 15:26.833
to the very cause
he professes to believe in.

15:26.917 --> 15:30.000
I don't know what it is,
his ambition, his ego

15:30.083 --> 15:32.500
his sense of personal destiny
gets in the way.

15:32.583 --> 15:36.458
Under other circumstances he
would want somebody to intervene

15:36.542 --> 15:38.333
before the wrong people
got hurt.

15:38.417 --> 15:41.333
Now, if indeed Sheridan
has lost his way

15:41.417 --> 15:44.000
don't you feel obligated
to intervene

15:44.083 --> 15:45.208
at least for the sake of others?

15:45.292 --> 15:46.542
I won't sell him out.

15:46.625 --> 15:48.167
You're the only one
who could clearly see

15:48.250 --> 15:49.792
what the hell's really
going on, Garibaldi.

15:49.875 --> 15:51.083
Open up your eyes.

15:51.167 --> 15:53.042
'You tell me something,
can you sleep at night'

15:53.125 --> 15:54.792
'knowing everything
could just slip away'

15:54.875 --> 15:56.833
'because of one man, huh?'

15:56.917 --> 15:59.000
You tell me,
can you stand by and watch'

15:59.083 --> 16:01.875
everything that you've worked
for die right before your eyes

16:01.958 --> 16:04.167
knowing that you could have done
something to stop it?

16:06.625 --> 16:07.750
Can you?

16:12.042 --> 16:15.083
[dramatic music]

16:29.000 --> 16:33.208
(Captain Jack)
'Oh, the others are gonna be
real glad to see you, yes, sir.'

16:33.292 --> 16:34.292
[chuckling]

16:34.375 --> 16:36.042
You wouldn't believe
half the stories

16:36.125 --> 16:39.208
we've heard about Babylon 5
this last year.

16:39.292 --> 16:41.458
- Such as?
- 'Crazy things.'

16:41.542 --> 16:43.750
One story had your lot
coming in here

16:43.833 --> 16:48.083
with an alien fleet to take over
the whole operations yourselves.

16:48.167 --> 16:50.917
[Captain Jack laughing]

16:51.000 --> 16:53.083
Then we had a reliable report

16:53.167 --> 16:56.292
that said you decided to write
off everybody back here

16:56.375 --> 16:57.625
and hang us out to dry.

16:57.708 --> 17:00.292
The captain's never forgotten
about Mars.

17:00.375 --> 17:03.083
We just haven't had a chance
to do anything about it till now

17:03.167 --> 17:04.333
what with the war and all.

17:04.417 --> 17:06.125
Right. Well..

17:07.667 --> 17:10.542
- What war?
- What do you mean, what war?

17:10.625 --> 17:13.917
Well, nothing personal,
but you gotta understand

17:14.000 --> 17:16.875
we don't hear a lot about
what's going on out there.

17:16.958 --> 17:20.042
I mean, aliens fighting aliens?

17:20.125 --> 17:22.250
Doesn't really involve us,
now, does it?

17:22.333 --> 17:24.292
(Marcus)
'I should bloody well hope
it does.'

17:24.375 --> 17:27.417
I don't believe
you haven't heard anything.

17:27.500 --> 17:29.958
Well, we, we get reports,
of course.

17:30.042 --> 17:34.042
A few pilots came through here,
pff, last summer

17:34.125 --> 17:35.875
mentioned something
was going on.

17:35.958 --> 17:38.292
We figured they was just
making up stories

17:38.375 --> 17:40.292
to try to impress people.

17:40.375 --> 17:43.292
We've heard
some pretty wild things.

17:43.375 --> 17:47.125
Real end-of-the-world sort
of stuff. You'd love it.

17:47.208 --> 17:50.167
You gotta remember, now, we've
been embargoed same as you.

17:50.250 --> 17:51.792
Even longer.

17:51.875 --> 17:54.000
Now, just the other day I, uh..

17:57.583 --> 18:00.625
- Who won?
- We did. We all did.

18:00.708 --> 18:04.417
Ah, yes, well, good for us.

18:06.167 --> 18:07.708
Just my luck.

18:07.792 --> 18:12.458
First time in my life I'm a war
hero and nobody knows about it.

18:12.542 --> 18:14.167
And worst of all,
I'm married to you.

18:14.250 --> 18:15.667
Yeah, well, that's not my idea.

18:15.750 --> 18:18.292
Oh, you say that now.
Tell that to your mother.

18:18.375 --> 18:20.208
'She never stopped calling us
about it.'

18:20.292 --> 18:23.500
"So when's the big day,
I've got to pick out patterns.

18:23.583 --> 18:25.500
Your father isn't gonna
live forever"

18:25.583 --> 18:26.750
and on and on and on and on.

18:26.833 --> 18:29.833
I hate this.
I really hate this.

18:29.917 --> 18:31.958
[laughing]

18:32.042 --> 18:34.167
You're just nervous, that's all.

18:34.250 --> 18:36.000
You'll get used to it.

18:36.083 --> 18:37.250
Next thing,
he'll be locking himself

18:37.333 --> 18:38.458
in the bathroom all night.

18:38.542 --> 18:41.583
[both laughing]

18:47.792 --> 18:51.875
(male announcer)
'Please advise Commander Ivanova
we have the cargo she wanted.'

18:51.958 --> 18:53.083
'Confirmed, shuttle.'

18:53.167 --> 18:55.625
'We'll have security
standing by.'

18:58.292 --> 19:01.167
I realize in the past
that we've had our little

19:01.250 --> 19:02.750
ups and downs.

19:02.833 --> 19:07.375
I mean, some of you
have tried to smuggle in dust..

19:07.458 --> 19:11.042
...weapons, other items
on our prohibited list

19:11.125 --> 19:12.958
and we've had
to come down on you.

19:13.042 --> 19:14.625
That's our job.

19:14.708 --> 19:16.417
Most days, nobody gets hurt.

19:16.500 --> 19:18.167
Oh, is the arm feeling
better now?

19:18.250 --> 19:20.000
Yeah, sure, fine.

19:20.083 --> 19:21.042
Except when it rains
and it hurts

19:21.125 --> 19:22.458
all up through here where you--

19:22.542 --> 19:24.375
Yes. Well, since it never rains
on Babylon 5

19:24.458 --> 19:26.875
that should encourage you
to spend more time here.

19:26.958 --> 19:29.000
But we hardly see
any of you anymore.

19:29.083 --> 19:31.000
Things are different now.

19:31.083 --> 19:32.125
Used to be we get caught

19:32.208 --> 19:34.750
we spend a couple of days
in the brig.

19:34.833 --> 19:37.583
'Yeah, maybe somebody
gets tossed around'

19:37.667 --> 19:41.042
but nobody gets killed
or stuck in prison for life.

19:41.125 --> 19:42.417
If those Earth patrol catch us

19:42.500 --> 19:45.042
running shipments
into Babylon 5..

19:45.833 --> 19:46.875
[sighing]

19:48.625 --> 19:50.875
No. Hm-mmm.

19:50.958 --> 19:53.292
- No deal.
- Same here.

19:53.375 --> 19:55.083
Dust market's gone down.

19:55.167 --> 19:57.375
And since the war,
there's guns all over the place.

19:57.458 --> 20:00.250
Nobody's buying.
Profits are down everywhere.

20:00.333 --> 20:01.667
Well, then perhaps now would be
a good time

20:01.750 --> 20:02.750
to invest in the future.

20:02.833 --> 20:04.208
The future.

20:04.292 --> 20:06.542
(Susan)
'Look,
here's what I'm offering.'

20:06.625 --> 20:09.542
Instead of the usual destructive
crap you guys bring in here

20:09.625 --> 20:12.583
I want you to start
transporting useful things.

20:12.667 --> 20:14.458
Those food items
that we can't grow here

20:14.542 --> 20:16.083
medicines we can't fabricate

20:16.167 --> 20:19.000
spare parts for fighters
and shuttles and other ships.

20:19.083 --> 20:20.375
[laughing]

20:20.458 --> 20:23.083
- Did I say something funny?
- Get real, Ivanova.

20:23.167 --> 20:26.042
There's no profit in that.
Not enough to justify the risk.

20:26.125 --> 20:27.208
That's where you're wrong.

20:27.292 --> 20:28.708
First, if you cooperate

20:28.792 --> 20:30.792
we'll provide fighter escorts
to protect your ships

20:30.875 --> 20:32.958
starting as far away
as four jumps from here.

20:33.042 --> 20:35.083
Now that should cut down
on your risk factor.

20:35.167 --> 20:37.708
'Second, for as long as
you're operating on our behalf'

20:37.792 --> 20:39.542
'we will take care
of your ships.'

20:39.625 --> 20:41.333
We've got the best mechanics
in the sector.

20:41.417 --> 20:43.625
Maintenance, fuel,
you name it. No cost.

20:43.708 --> 20:46.458
We'll upgrade your data systems
and supercharge your engines

20:46.542 --> 20:49.417
and if you have an accident,
we'll repair your ships.

20:49.500 --> 20:52.333
And sooner or later,
your ships will have accidents.

20:52.417 --> 20:54.208
My pilots don't have accidents.

20:54.292 --> 20:57.167
- They will. I'll see to it.
- You wouldn't.

20:57.250 --> 20:59.083
I got a 200-megawatt
pulse cannon

20:59.167 --> 21:01.750
on the forward cargo bay
that says otherwise.

21:01.833 --> 21:04.542
'The odds of you having such
an accident are greatly reduced'

21:04.625 --> 21:06.917
'once you sign on with us.'

21:07.000 --> 21:08.583
And since we'll be maintaining
your ships

21:08.667 --> 21:09.792
it would be in your best
interest

21:09.875 --> 21:11.792
to keep us supplied
with fresh parts.

21:11.875 --> 21:14.500
'You're not gonna get rich,
but take my word for'

21:14.583 --> 21:16.333
'you're going to make a profit.'

21:16.417 --> 21:20.208
And finally, I don't wanna name
names or anything but, um

21:20.292 --> 21:21.583
we did a little checking around

21:21.667 --> 21:25.208
and...some of you are wanted
by Earthgov..

21:25.292 --> 21:28.875
...on charges
ranging from trespassing..

21:30.583 --> 21:33.292
...to arms smuggling.

21:33.375 --> 21:35.750
To assault on Earth property.

21:37.375 --> 21:39.542
Now, once all of this is over

21:39.625 --> 21:41.583
we are willing to overlook
all of that.

21:43.792 --> 21:45.875
Everyone's entitled
to a fresh start.

21:45.958 --> 21:48.042
You're even willing to forget
about that business?

21:48.125 --> 21:51.125
Yes, even though it did make
Mr. Garibaldi's hair fall out.

21:51.208 --> 21:52.792
'You had no way of knowing
what was in that bottle.'

21:52.875 --> 21:56.875
That's my story and I'm sticking
to it just in case he asks.

21:56.958 --> 21:59.042
You only bring in
what we tell you to bring in.

21:59.125 --> 22:02.333
No weapons, no dust, no more
illegal or dangerous items.

22:02.417 --> 22:05.167
You play it clean
and we'll work with you.

22:05.250 --> 22:06.625
Look, you'll have more money

22:06.708 --> 22:08.917
your ships will be in perfect
running order

22:09.000 --> 22:11.542
and you'll have an investment
in the future.

22:11.625 --> 22:13.750
What more could you ask for?

22:18.625 --> 22:20.375
You seeing anybody, Ivanova?

22:22.208 --> 22:25.292
[instrumental music]

22:29.750 --> 22:31.500
(Captain Jack)
'Once you've been cleared,
they'll call in'

22:31.583 --> 22:33.458
'the other big shots
of the Resistance'

22:33.542 --> 22:35.708
so as you can talk with them.

22:35.792 --> 22:37.083
Here we go.

22:40.417 --> 22:42.000
No, this way.

22:43.333 --> 22:46.083
You sure you know
where you're going?

22:46.167 --> 22:48.917
Well, a Resistance cell isn't
exactly gonna be on a map

22:49.000 --> 22:53.250
in the Martian Tourist Bureau,
now is it?

22:53.333 --> 22:56.625
We had to move into these
old mining tunnels.

22:56.708 --> 22:59.792
Only way we could guard
against a frontal assault.

22:59.875 --> 23:01.667
Trust Captain Jack.

23:01.750 --> 23:03.750
He'll get you
where you want to go.

23:07.292 --> 23:09.458
I don't trust anyone
who talks of themselves

23:09.542 --> 23:10.875
in the third person.

23:15.542 --> 23:18.125
Right, here we are.
Right up through there.

23:18.208 --> 23:21.833
That's far enough.
Move, you die instantly.

23:29.708 --> 23:32.792
Just take it slow and easy,
and nobody gets hurt.

23:32.875 --> 23:35.083
Up against the wall. Over there.

23:35.167 --> 23:37.625
Look, I don't understand.
Now, you were told to expect us.

23:37.708 --> 23:39.500
Oh, we're expecting
all kinds of people.

23:39.583 --> 23:42.167
Whether you're one of 'em
or not we'll have to see.

23:42.250 --> 23:43.708
Now, up against it!

23:45.042 --> 23:47.917
- Good job, Jack.
- All part of the service.

23:48.000 --> 23:49.542
- Where's Number--
- Not now.

23:54.542 --> 23:56.125
Check this out.

23:56.208 --> 23:59.042
Oh, I've seen these before.

23:59.125 --> 24:02.333
Took one off a dead Minbari
during the war.

24:02.417 --> 24:04.417
Not the sort of thing
I'd expect to see

24:04.500 --> 24:06.083
one of us carrying around.

24:06.167 --> 24:08.750
- I'm a Ranger.
- Is that so?

24:08.833 --> 24:12.458
Well, you a long way
from Texas, son.

24:12.542 --> 24:15.958
And, that ain't
the right accent. Let's go.

24:21.750 --> 24:22.792
Jack.

24:37.292 --> 24:39.958
Look, can we talk
to somebody in charge?

24:40.042 --> 24:42.500
That'd be me.
I'm Number Two around here.

24:42.583 --> 24:43.833
Then, can we talk to Number One?

24:43.917 --> 24:45.458
Well, that's what
I'm trying to decide.

24:45.542 --> 24:47.875
See, we got word a hit squad
was being sent to take out

24:47.958 --> 24:49.542
the head of Mars Resistance.

24:49.625 --> 24:52.417
Said they might be coming in
from one of the outer sectors

24:52.500 --> 24:55.750
and here you two come in
right on cue.

24:56.792 --> 24:58.292
Well, you can't believe--

24:58.375 --> 25:01.042
You'd be surprised
on the things I can believe.

25:01.125 --> 25:04.875
See, around here,
we only got two types.

25:04.958 --> 25:07.417
The suspicious and the dead.

25:07.500 --> 25:10.250
I trust the people
I know and nobody else.

25:10.333 --> 25:11.833
Look, I-I don't understand.

25:11.917 --> 25:13.875
Now, this should've been cleared
before we got here.

25:13.958 --> 25:16.958
(Number Two)
'They've been jamming our
transmissions for six months.'

25:17.042 --> 25:19.458
Now, we only got
a partial message saying

25:19.542 --> 25:22.708
someone's coming in
from Babylon 5.

25:22.792 --> 25:24.333
Never got a clear ID.

25:26.417 --> 25:28.042
Tell you what..

25:28.125 --> 25:31.542
...since I don't want to appear
inhospitable

25:31.625 --> 25:33.042
give me your Identicards.

25:33.125 --> 25:35.167
The real ones.

25:35.250 --> 25:38.875
Now, we'll check the DNA code
on here against your blood type.

25:38.958 --> 25:41.500
That'll tell me
if they really belong to you.

25:41.583 --> 25:43.458
Then we'll pull
a partial ID code

25:43.542 --> 25:45.333
see if we can get a clear signal
to Babylon 5

25:45.417 --> 25:47.292
try for a match on the rest.

25:47.375 --> 25:50.583
Anyone on the outside,
look like a frequency check.

25:52.125 --> 25:55.250
If it matches, we'll talk.

25:55.333 --> 25:59.125
If it doesn't, you two
are gonna leave here feet first.

25:59.208 --> 26:01.250
Now, let's have 'em.

26:10.208 --> 26:12.292
[clearing throat]

26:12.375 --> 26:13.667
Captain, I've finished my work.

26:13.750 --> 26:15.542
I, I'd like to give
my regards to Number--

26:15.625 --> 26:16.958
- No, you better wait here.
- What?

26:17.042 --> 26:18.292
You're their contact.

26:18.375 --> 26:21.167
A friendly voice might help calm
'em down a bit.

26:21.250 --> 26:25.292
This'll take a few hours, so you
may as well get comfortable.

26:25.375 --> 26:27.250
You get the blood sample.

26:27.333 --> 26:30.125
And if they do anything
you don't like..

26:31.708 --> 26:32.875
...shoot to kill.

26:35.292 --> 26:38.375
[instrumental music]

26:54.917 --> 26:58.583
If you could look anymore
unhappy, please do not tell me.

26:58.667 --> 27:00.750
There are some things
I would rather not know.

27:02.250 --> 27:04.500
I'm just mad at myself.

27:04.583 --> 27:05.583
I went to Michael today.

27:05.667 --> 27:08.458
I figured we could talk this
through.

27:08.542 --> 27:10.458
Well, we ended up
going around and around

27:10.542 --> 27:13.292
and I got hot, then he got hot,
and then I stormed out.

27:16.458 --> 27:19.375
He's like a complete stranger.

27:19.458 --> 27:22.250
A few months ago I-I would
have trusted him with my life.

27:22.333 --> 27:25.792
But now, I don't know.

27:25.875 --> 27:28.208
Sometimes feel like I..

27:28.292 --> 27:30.458
...you know, I'm better
at fighting wars

27:30.542 --> 27:31.750
than relationships.

27:34.167 --> 27:36.708
You know, I keep thinking
that I can turn him around

27:36.792 --> 27:40.875
if I could just figure out
the right words.

27:40.958 --> 27:44.708
He has to find his own way.
And so do you.

27:44.792 --> 27:46.750
In the past,
those two paths have crossed.

27:46.833 --> 27:48.583
Now, perhaps they don't.

27:48.667 --> 27:51.625
- It is the way of things.
- I know.

27:51.708 --> 27:53.875
Doesn't make it any easier.

27:56.167 --> 27:57.958
Anyway, I didn't mean
to get so morose.

27:58.042 --> 27:59.917
You came looking for me
for a reason.

28:00.000 --> 28:03.208
Ivanova tells me
that you have taken the day off.

28:03.292 --> 28:04.750
Hm, at gunpoint.

28:04.833 --> 28:07.083
(Delenn)
'Then, um, this may be
a good time.'

28:10.333 --> 28:14.042
As you know,
when Minbari become close

28:14.125 --> 28:15.583
as we have become close--

28:15.667 --> 28:17.583
- Not another ritual.
- It is our tradition.

28:17.667 --> 28:19.667
- I'm just about ritualed out.
- John--

28:19.750 --> 28:21.833
Well, how many more of these
rituals are there?

28:21.917 --> 28:24.583
Um, depending on the length
of time we take

28:24.667 --> 28:26.875
before fully committing
to one another

28:26.958 --> 28:29.750
which clan is in dominance
at the time

28:29.833 --> 28:34.167
'the types and amounts
of offerings made at temple..'

28:34.250 --> 28:36.167
...as many as, um..

28:38.500 --> 28:40.958
...uh...47.

28:42.042 --> 28:44.958
- No, no, no, no, 50.
- 50?

28:45.042 --> 28:46.083
Fifty.

28:47.375 --> 28:49.250
Anyone ever elope on your world?

28:49.333 --> 28:51.958
It has happened, but it is
always a great disgrace.

28:52.042 --> 28:55.792
A disgrace to the family,
the caste, the clan. Got it.

28:55.875 --> 28:59.250
(Delenn)
'That's why Minbari do not have
problems with relationships.'

28:59.333 --> 29:01.042
We have a ritual for everything.

29:01.125 --> 29:04.125
For being together,
for being apart, for meeting

29:04.208 --> 29:06.625
for saying goodbye,
for solving disputes.

29:06.708 --> 29:08.167
Alright, alright, alright.

29:09.875 --> 29:11.375
Which is this one?

29:11.458 --> 29:13.875
It is called Shan-Fall.

29:13.958 --> 29:16.167
The third movement
of preparation

29:16.250 --> 29:17.875
and mutual understanding.

29:19.625 --> 29:21.625
Oh, that old one, yeah.

29:21.708 --> 29:24.333
In a little while,
you come to my quarters

29:24.417 --> 29:26.542
where we spend the night
together

29:26.625 --> 29:30.500
discovering one another's
centers of pleasure.

29:30.583 --> 29:33.708
It is done with great
deliberation

29:33.792 --> 29:36.958
prayerfully,
with respect and meditation.

29:37.042 --> 29:40.042
It is good for us to know
all we can about one another

29:40.125 --> 29:44.083
should we continue the joining
of our hearts and our blood.

29:44.167 --> 29:47.083
So, you can meet me there.

29:49.042 --> 29:51.000
Unless, of course

29:51.083 --> 29:53.000
you can find
something of equal value

29:53.083 --> 29:55.958
sitting here
and staring at plants

29:56.042 --> 29:59.083
while feeling guilty
about things you cannot change.

30:02.208 --> 30:05.042
[instrumental music]

30:06.917 --> 30:08.000
Nope.

30:17.708 --> 30:19.667
Damn, it's hot down here.

30:21.375 --> 30:23.708
How can you stand it
in that coat?

30:23.792 --> 30:26.167
It's fine, fine.

30:26.250 --> 30:28.458
Guess you get used to it
after a while.

30:31.375 --> 30:34.208
You eating another one
of those things, Jack?

30:34.292 --> 30:36.958
[scoffing]
Thought you were on a diet.

30:37.042 --> 30:41.083
Yes, well, uh, important people
have larger appetites.

30:42.875 --> 30:43.958
[chuckling softly]

30:44.042 --> 30:46.000
[Marcus clearing throat]

30:46.083 --> 30:49.542
Look, uh, I'm-I'm sorry
about what happened.

30:56.792 --> 30:58.958
You wanna see something?

30:59.042 --> 31:00.083
Alright.

31:02.250 --> 31:04.542
- That's my daughter Elysha.
- Yeah?

31:04.625 --> 31:06.750
Just turned 18 two days ago.

31:06.833 --> 31:08.500
Can't send her
a birthday greeting though

31:08.583 --> 31:10.667
not with this embargo and all.

31:10.750 --> 31:13.750
- But I think she understands.
- She's gorgeous.

31:13.833 --> 31:15.167
Yeah.

31:15.250 --> 31:16.833
She's the alpha and omega

31:16.917 --> 31:19.958
of...my soul.

31:20.042 --> 31:22.875
First thing I think about
in the morning..

31:24.042 --> 31:26.708
...last thing I think about
at night.

31:26.792 --> 31:29.875
I've been doing
most of my business for her.

31:29.958 --> 31:33.292
You know, a little, uh,
security from her old man.

31:33.375 --> 31:36.958
[chuckling]
Give her something
to be proud of.

31:37.042 --> 31:38.167
Is this her address on the back?

31:38.250 --> 31:39.750
[chuckling]
Yeah.

31:39.833 --> 31:42.667
Yeah, I-I kept forgetting it, so
I finally had to write it down.

31:42.750 --> 31:46.542
Block this, subsection that,
city district something.

31:46.625 --> 31:48.375
Whatever happened
to good old addresses

31:48.458 --> 31:49.792
that's what I'd like to know.

31:49.875 --> 31:51.625
Have you ever met
Number One before?

31:52.875 --> 31:56.625
Many times. We're very close.

31:56.708 --> 31:58.625
I, I wanted to bring her
back something

31:58.708 --> 32:01.375
but I couldn't find anything
on my last run.

32:01.458 --> 32:04.833
But that's always the way
it is at Deneb 4.

32:04.917 --> 32:05.833
Nothing there.

32:05.917 --> 32:07.500
Yeah, but I thought that..

32:07.583 --> 32:10.667
Alright, up.
Hands behind your heads. Move!

32:11.792 --> 32:14.208
What? What's wrong?

32:14.292 --> 32:17.500
Well, the ID numbers you gave us
didn't check out.

32:17.583 --> 32:20.750
And the DNA didn't match.

32:20.833 --> 32:23.208
- That's what's wrong.
- That's impossible.

32:23.292 --> 32:24.667
(Number Two)
What'd you do with our contacts?

32:24.750 --> 32:27.875
- You got 30 seconds.
- We didn't do anything.

32:27.958 --> 32:29.292
Wrong answer!

32:29.375 --> 32:32.167
Twenty seconds.
First, we kill him, then you.

32:33.833 --> 32:36.125
Make it two minutes.

32:36.208 --> 32:38.917
- You shouldn't be here.
- I wanna see them for myself.

32:39.000 --> 32:41.458
You're exposing yourself
to risk.

32:41.542 --> 32:42.958
(Tessa)
'That's the nature of the job.'

32:43.042 --> 32:44.625
'I wanna know
what they're up to.'

32:44.708 --> 32:45.917
Marcus.

32:46.917 --> 32:48.292
I see it.

32:49.792 --> 32:51.542
[grunting]

32:51.625 --> 32:52.708
Get down!

33:01.833 --> 33:03.333
Let's go.

33:09.958 --> 33:11.542
- What the hell was that?
- I don't know.

33:11.625 --> 33:13.542
I've never seen
anything like it.

33:13.625 --> 33:16.292
Whatever it was,
it was on Captain Jack.

33:16.375 --> 33:17.875
Where is he?

33:20.833 --> 33:23.917
[panting]

33:39.167 --> 33:40.792
We found your real Identicards.

33:40.875 --> 33:42.458
Jack must've switched them
for the fakes

33:42.542 --> 33:45.083
'when you were
handing 'em over.'

33:45.167 --> 33:46.667
I don't understand.

33:46.750 --> 33:50.208
Why'd he do it?
He's been with us for years.

33:50.292 --> 33:52.583
Well, he may not
have had a choice.

33:52.667 --> 33:53.917
How so?

33:54.000 --> 33:56.500
Well, the skin of this thing is
covered with microfibers

33:56.583 --> 33:59.208
that dig into the skin
and hook into the neural system.

34:05.375 --> 34:07.667
The whole thing..

34:07.750 --> 34:10.417
...is built like
a series of synaptic relays

34:10.500 --> 34:11.750
with a symbiotic--

34:11.833 --> 34:13.875
English, doc.

34:13.958 --> 34:16.167
This entity..

34:16.250 --> 34:19.583
...can cut into the neural
pathways and override them.

34:19.667 --> 34:23.833
Now, some of the microfibers
are fresh

34:23.917 --> 34:25.958
so my guess is

34:26.042 --> 34:28.500
that its control
over a given host

34:28.583 --> 34:31.125
grows as it does.

34:31.208 --> 34:33.292
A parasite.

34:33.375 --> 34:35.833
I hate parasites.
Nasty little buggers.

34:35.917 --> 34:37.875
So, this was controlling him
the whole time?

34:37.958 --> 34:39.875
Yeah, mostly.

34:39.958 --> 34:42.500
Wouldn't let him warn us.

34:42.583 --> 34:45.292
Didn't notice the small things
he kept doing, though.

34:45.375 --> 34:47.083
Well, he kept trying to tell me
that something was wrong

34:47.167 --> 34:48.792
'without actually saying it.'

34:48.875 --> 34:51.708
The way he kept his coat on
even though he was sweaty.

34:51.792 --> 34:53.333
Saying there was nothing
on Deneb worth buying

34:53.417 --> 34:55.958
when it's the biggest
colony market in the area.

34:56.042 --> 34:59.417
And...giving me
his daughter's address

34:59.500 --> 35:01.583
contact her in case
he didn't survive this.

35:04.750 --> 35:07.375
We lost him when he got topside
and hopped a tube.

35:07.458 --> 35:10.500
- Does he still have his comset?
- I didn't find it anywhere.

35:10.583 --> 35:12.417
But we did find something else.

35:12.500 --> 35:14.833
He broke into a weapons case.

35:14.917 --> 35:16.958
Took a thermal grenade.

35:19.792 --> 35:22.542
[instrumental music]

35:25.250 --> 35:26.625
[beeping]

35:32.750 --> 35:35.250
(Tessa)
'Jack? Jack, it's me.'

35:38.042 --> 35:39.667
Yes.

35:39.750 --> 35:42.000
What happened wasn't your fault.

35:42.083 --> 35:44.917
Come on back. It's okay.
Nobody got hurt.

35:45.000 --> 35:47.083
(Jack)
'I can't do that.'

35:47.167 --> 35:49.375
'They knew who I was.'

35:49.458 --> 35:52.375
They found me
in the middle of the night

35:52.458 --> 35:55.333
and they put that thing on me.

35:57.750 --> 36:00.250
In me.

36:00.333 --> 36:03.917
I, I wanted to warn you
but I couldn't say anything.

36:04.000 --> 36:06.375
It wouldn't let me.

36:06.458 --> 36:09.000
Now it's, it's too late.

36:09.083 --> 36:11.792
'No. It's not.
We killed the thing.'

36:13.250 --> 36:15.458
You killed a part of it.

36:15.542 --> 36:18.333
But see, you can't remove
the whole thing.

36:20.000 --> 36:22.167
The thing of it is..

36:23.458 --> 36:25.500
..the damn thing of it is..

36:26.375 --> 36:28.917
...they grow back.

36:29.000 --> 36:31.417
They always grow back.

36:31.500 --> 36:34.542
Jack, listen to me.

36:34.625 --> 36:37.083
Don't do anything stupid.

36:37.167 --> 36:39.208
They say these, uh..

36:39.292 --> 36:42.833
...tunnels can withstand just
about anything.

36:42.917 --> 36:45.042
And I've always wondered
if that was true or not.

36:48.833 --> 36:52.625
I guess I'll finally find out
what my..

36:52.708 --> 36:54.917
...tax money's been doing
all these years.

36:55.958 --> 36:57.625
(Tessa)
'Jack, don't be a..'

36:57.708 --> 36:59.750
[explosion]

37:09.625 --> 37:10.875
- Thank you.
- Okay.

37:13.083 --> 37:14.292
Michael.

37:15.708 --> 37:18.333
Ah, look, uh..

37:18.417 --> 37:21.875
...I wanna apologize
for losing my temper earlier.

37:21.958 --> 37:24.333
I-I think we should
try this again.

37:24.417 --> 37:27.125
You're him. You're Sheridan.

37:27.208 --> 37:28.792
Ah, yes, I am. I'm sorry--

37:28.875 --> 37:31.458
You went to Z'Ha'Dum
and you died and returned

37:31.542 --> 37:33.083
with knowledge of good and evil.

37:33.167 --> 37:35.458
- You understand.
- Look, it's not what you think.

37:35.542 --> 37:36.625
- Well, you got that right.
- Just a blessing.

37:36.708 --> 37:38.042
That's all I ask, please.

37:38.125 --> 37:40.167
- I'm-I'm sorry.
- Come on! He's not the pope.

37:40.250 --> 37:41.250
He doesn't look
anything like her.

37:41.333 --> 37:42.708
Let me go. You know the truth.

37:42.792 --> 37:44.208
- You've seen the truth.
- Hey, leave her alone.

37:44.292 --> 37:45.375
- Let me go!
- What is it?

37:45.458 --> 37:46.500
You-you like this?
Is that it?

37:46.583 --> 37:48.000
No, you're hurting her!

37:48.083 --> 37:50.208
He's not what he appears to be!
Give it up, will you?

37:50.292 --> 37:52.750
- Let me go!
- I said, let her go!

37:52.833 --> 37:55.083
[all exclaiming]

37:55.167 --> 37:57.167
It's alright. It's alright.
It's alright.

38:03.667 --> 38:06.625
[breathing heavily]

38:08.083 --> 38:10.917
Now, because of everything
we've been through before

38:11.000 --> 38:12.958
you get that one free.

38:14.333 --> 38:16.292
Next one,
I'll take your head off.

38:21.458 --> 38:23.042
'Come on.'

38:23.125 --> 38:24.458
[sighing]

38:26.042 --> 38:27.125
[sighing]

38:28.833 --> 38:30.750
Damn it.

38:30.833 --> 38:33.500
[instrumental music]

38:42.583 --> 38:44.167
[sighing]

38:47.292 --> 38:49.042
[device beeping]

38:49.125 --> 38:50.792
- 'Yes?'
- It's me.

38:53.958 --> 38:56.167
Delenn, you wouldn't believe
the kind of day I've..

38:58.083 --> 38:59.750
(Delenn)
'Y-yes?'

39:00.875 --> 39:02.750
I, I thought we were
going to be alone.

39:02.833 --> 39:03.958
I mean, what are they..

39:04.042 --> 39:05.875
They're here for the ritual.

39:05.958 --> 39:09.208
While we discover
one another's pleasure centers

39:09.292 --> 39:11.333
they wait outside to pray
and meditate

39:11.417 --> 39:14.250
and ensure that things
do not go too far.

39:16.667 --> 39:18.792
'It is our tradition.'

39:20.042 --> 39:22.750
- They're going to be out here?
- Yes.

39:22.833 --> 39:25.208
- While we're in there?
- Yes.

39:30.208 --> 39:31.542
I can't.

39:31.625 --> 39:33.417
Delenn, I-I can't
in front of other..

39:33.500 --> 39:35.292
- John--
- No, no, no, no, no, no.

39:35.375 --> 39:38.833
John, it matters to me
that we do this properly.

39:38.917 --> 39:42.500
In keeping with the values
and traditions of our people.

39:42.583 --> 39:44.750
As the engagement ring
meant so much to you

39:44.833 --> 39:47.792
our ceremonies mean
just as much to us.

39:48.625 --> 39:50.083
Please stay.

39:54.375 --> 39:56.208
[instrumental music]

40:08.875 --> 40:11.250
[instrumental music]

40:28.417 --> 40:29.458
Woo-hoo?

40:45.167 --> 40:47.917
I heard back from the other
leaders in the Resistance.

40:48.000 --> 40:49.292
They're on their way.

40:49.375 --> 40:50.583
But it'll take a couple of days.

40:50.667 --> 40:52.708
It looks like you're stuck here
for a while.

40:52.792 --> 40:56.000
Typical. Nothing on this trip
has been easy.

40:56.083 --> 40:59.375
I don't suppose there's any
place around here we could stay.

40:59.458 --> 41:02.583
I hot-linked your fake
Identicards to a hotel I know.

41:02.667 --> 41:04.375
They don't ask questions
and they don't see

41:04.458 --> 41:05.833
what we don't want them to see.

41:05.917 --> 41:08.875
Meanwhile, I was going to go out
and get some dinner.

41:08.958 --> 41:11.625
If you'd like to join me.

41:11.708 --> 41:12.958
Why don't you two go on ahead

41:13.042 --> 41:15.250
and I'll meet you
at the hotel later.

41:17.667 --> 41:19.458
- Are you sure?
- Positive.

41:22.292 --> 41:25.417
- Oh! W-where will I find you?
- The Red Planet Hotel.

41:25.500 --> 41:27.750
For some reason they gave you
two the honeymoon suite.

41:29.125 --> 41:30.875
Right. Fine.

41:32.750 --> 41:34.125
I'll remind you of this
when we decide

41:34.208 --> 41:36.417
on custody of the children.

41:43.083 --> 41:45.250
Hear you were looking for me.

41:45.333 --> 41:46.625
Yeah.

41:46.708 --> 41:49.458
Also hear that you had
a little dustup with Sheridan.

41:51.333 --> 41:52.833
Yeah.

41:52.917 --> 41:54.000
Look , ah..

41:56.167 --> 41:58.875
...I think he's lost it.

41:58.958 --> 42:00.250
He's starting
to believe the things

42:00.333 --> 42:01.500
everybody's been saying
about him

42:01.583 --> 42:05.333
and buying into this
hero-worship stuff.

42:05.417 --> 42:08.250
It's become about him,
not what we've been saying

42:08.333 --> 42:10.375
not what we've been
fighting for.

42:10.458 --> 42:13.625
And if he could see straight,
he'd agree with me but, uh..

42:14.417 --> 42:15.500
...in the end..

42:17.667 --> 42:19.292
...we're gonna lose everything
we been working for

42:19.375 --> 42:20.375
because of one man.

42:20.458 --> 42:21.458
That's what happens.

42:21.542 --> 42:22.792
It's exactly what happens

42:22.875 --> 42:25.958
when one man begins to matter
more than the cause.

42:27.792 --> 42:29.625
Are you with us?

42:29.708 --> 42:30.792
I won't hurt him.

42:30.875 --> 42:32.708
No one's asking you to.

42:32.792 --> 42:35.250
You give him to us
when we tell you to.

42:35.333 --> 42:37.750
We'll see to it that
he gets the help that he needs.

42:41.375 --> 42:43.667
Are you with us?

42:50.208 --> 42:51.333
I'm with you.

43:04.375 --> 43:06.833
[theme music]

43:33.792 --> 43:36.875
[music continues]
