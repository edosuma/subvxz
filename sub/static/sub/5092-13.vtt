WEBVTT

00:14.182 --> 00:16.015
Carolyn?

00:17.685 --> 00:20.321
Carolyn!

00:20.354 --> 00:21.122
(turns off vacuum)

00:21.155 --> 00:21.922
Mr. Bynes,
is everything all right?

00:21.955 --> 00:22.590
Well, Mrs. Bynes
isn't picking up,

00:22.623 --> 00:24.392
I thought I'd check on her.

00:24.425 --> 00:26.160
So did her daughter.
She's in there now.

00:26.194 --> 00:28.062
I told you not to allow Sandy in

00:28.096 --> 00:29.730
unless Mrs. Bynes and I gave
our permission.

00:29.763 --> 00:31.499
I didn't. She has a key.

00:31.532 --> 00:33.434
She's not supposed
to have a key!

00:33.467 --> 00:36.070
(woman screams)

00:36.104 --> 00:37.638
Carolyn?!

00:37.671 --> 00:38.706
Carolyn!

00:41.109 --> 00:41.975
Sandy?

00:42.009 --> 00:44.112
What did you do to her?
What did you do?

00:44.145 --> 00:45.346
What are you talking about?

00:45.379 --> 00:46.514
I warned her.
Sandy...

00:46.547 --> 00:48.449
I tried to warn
her about you.
Carolyn!

00:48.482 --> 00:50.251
What are you talking about?

00:50.284 --> 00:51.119
See?

00:54.322 --> 00:55.556
Oh, my God!

00:56.357 --> 00:58.092
Oh, my God!

01:07.168 --> 01:08.869
OPERATOR:
911. What's your emergency?

01:08.902 --> 01:10.804
Yeah, something's happened
to my wife!

01:10.838 --> 01:13.174
I need an ambulance to 886
Park Avenue, seventh floor.

01:13.207 --> 01:15.843
Hi. I'd like to report a murder.

01:24.785 --> 01:25.819
Morning, Your Excellency.

01:25.853 --> 01:28.189
Good Morning, Commissioner.
Thank you, Jonathan.

01:28.222 --> 01:29.623
You're looking well, Terry.

01:29.657 --> 01:30.891
I owe it
to clean living.

01:30.924 --> 01:32.893
Not that I have a choice.
(chuckles)

01:32.926 --> 01:34.728
Monsignor Ferraro.

01:34.762 --> 01:37.165
Monsignor.
Commissioner, thank you
for joining us.

01:37.198 --> 01:40.201
Please, please,
have a seat.

01:41.869 --> 01:43.671
Well, what can I do for you?

01:43.704 --> 01:46.240
Lauro is visiting
from Rome as a postulate

01:46.274 --> 01:49.410
in the cause of a priest
from a Brooklyn parish,

01:49.443 --> 01:50.611
Father William Campion.

01:52.180 --> 01:53.080
I believe you knew him.

01:53.113 --> 01:56.384
Father Bill is a candidate
for sainthood?

01:56.417 --> 01:57.718
Isn't it wonderful?

01:57.751 --> 02:02.656
Well, as a boy, we nicknamed
certain priests

02:02.690 --> 02:06.260
"Saint So-and-So," but Father
Bill sure wasn't one of them.

02:06.294 --> 02:09.297
Well, granted,
he was an iconoclast.

02:09.330 --> 02:12.166
(chuckles)
But the evidence suggests

02:12.200 --> 02:14.735
there's at least one
posthumous miracle

02:14.768 --> 02:17.438
attributable to Father Campion.

02:17.471 --> 02:19.673
The Giants in Super Bowl XLII?

02:19.707 --> 02:23.177
(chuckles) Well,
maybe make that two miracles.

02:34.322 --> 02:36.590
My wife had M.S.

02:36.624 --> 02:39.460
She was supposed to
inject herself with interferon.

02:39.493 --> 02:44.265
but she was afraid of needles,
so, sometimes...

02:44.298 --> 02:45.333
she'd forget.

02:45.366 --> 02:46.967
Well, the vials were empty,

02:47.000 --> 02:49.270
so we're assuming
that she did take her meds.

02:49.303 --> 02:50.338
Then what happened?

02:50.371 --> 02:52.906
The paramedics said it seems
like a heart attack.

02:52.940 --> 02:53.741
A heart attack?

02:53.774 --> 02:56.310
We were only worried
about the M.S.

02:56.344 --> 02:59.480
That's why I came home, to make
sure she took her injection.

02:59.513 --> 03:02.650
Are you going to arrest him?!
Why haven't you arrested him?!

03:02.683 --> 03:03.651
Hey, hey! Arrest him for what?

03:03.684 --> 03:05.219
What is he even doing home?

03:05.253 --> 03:06.554
He came back to destroy
the evidence!

03:06.587 --> 03:08.422
Murderer!
That's... that's enough.
That's enough.

03:08.456 --> 03:09.757
Settle down.

03:09.790 --> 03:10.958
Settle down, okay?

03:10.991 --> 03:13.894
My stepdaughter has
some serious issues.

03:13.927 --> 03:16.297
She was very close
with her father,

03:16.330 --> 03:17.765
and he passed away
about a year

03:17.798 --> 03:19.567
before her mother
and I got married.

03:19.600 --> 03:24.372
Right. Well, she was here with
the body before you got here?

03:24.405 --> 03:28.376
Yes. She's not supposed
to just come in the house.

03:28.409 --> 03:30.244
We've had problems with her.

03:30.278 --> 03:31.245
Murderer!

03:31.279 --> 03:32.446
Hey! Hey!

03:32.480 --> 03:34.948
You gotta tone it down, okay?
I understand you're upset,

03:34.982 --> 03:37.285
but it's time
to calm down now.
No, no!

03:37.318 --> 03:38.452
I know that he killed her.

03:38.486 --> 03:41.255
You don't...
you don't know anything.

03:41.289 --> 03:43.824
Look, right now, it looks
like your mom may have died

03:43.857 --> 03:45.393
of natural causes,
all right?
No-no-no-no-no!

03:45.426 --> 03:46.827
No, I know that
Charles murdered her.

03:46.860 --> 03:48.529
How do you know that?

03:48.562 --> 03:50.230
God told me.

04:21.661 --> 04:24.498
You should be talking to
Charles, not to me.

04:24.532 --> 04:26.534
Uh, we will, Ms. Huffman,

04:26.567 --> 04:28.702
but he's making funeral
arrangements right now.

04:28.736 --> 04:30.904
We wanted
to speak to you first

04:30.938 --> 04:33.841
because you were the one
that found your mother, okay?

04:33.874 --> 04:35.943
I knew she was dead.

04:35.976 --> 04:40.848
I hoped she wasn't,
but... I knew.

04:40.881 --> 04:41.915
Right.

04:41.949 --> 04:43.751
Because God told you?

04:43.784 --> 04:45.953
While I was jogging on
the Promenade,

04:45.986 --> 04:47.788
He told me Charles did it.

04:47.821 --> 04:49.056
How did He tell you?

04:49.089 --> 04:50.924
I heard a voice.

04:50.958 --> 04:52.493
You heard a voice in your head?

04:52.526 --> 04:55.429
But hasn't God ever talked
to you?

04:55.463 --> 04:58.031
I'm Catholic;
when I speak to God,

04:58.065 --> 04:59.633
it's usually a
one-way conversation.

04:59.667 --> 05:01.001
And I'm Jewish.

05:01.034 --> 05:03.036
It's the same god.

05:05.038 --> 05:07.074
Look, why else would I have
come here just then?

05:07.107 --> 05:08.776
Well, that's what
we were wondering.

05:08.809 --> 05:10.744
Has God ever told you
to hurt anybody?

05:10.778 --> 05:12.846
Like my mother?

05:12.880 --> 05:14.081
The housekeeper said you
didn't visit much.

05:14.114 --> 05:16.384
But that's because of Charles.

05:16.417 --> 05:17.818
He's evil!

05:17.851 --> 05:20.654
Okay, look, we have no proof,

05:20.688 --> 05:22.423
no evidence
that Charles is evil.

05:22.456 --> 05:24.958
He married my mother
for her money

05:24.992 --> 05:26.994
just like his first wife,

05:27.027 --> 05:29.029
who supposedly killed herself.

05:30.998 --> 05:33.066
His first wife committed
suicide?

05:33.100 --> 05:35.736
She left him
a ton of money, too.

05:41.108 --> 05:45.012
Given your position and the fact
that you knew him,

05:45.045 --> 05:47.147
Monsignor and I thought
you could provide valuable

05:47.180 --> 05:49.049
evaluations for his cause.

05:49.082 --> 05:51.585
My mother was a saint.

05:51.619 --> 05:54.388
My wife was a saint,
especially by the time she was

05:54.422 --> 05:56.624
chasing four kids under ten
around the house.

05:56.657 --> 05:59.026
We're talking about
canonization here, Frank,

05:59.059 --> 06:00.428
of one of our own.

06:00.461 --> 06:02.129
I'm really not your guy.

06:02.162 --> 06:03.063
Why's that?

06:03.096 --> 06:05.733
Well, for starters,
I'm a cop at heart.

06:05.766 --> 06:08.569
Which makes me
by definition a skeptic.

06:08.602 --> 06:11.004
Which makes you all the more
valuable in his cause.

06:11.038 --> 06:13.073
Not if the cause is
giving him a halo.

06:13.106 --> 06:14.642
And why is that?

06:14.675 --> 06:18.479
Father Bill was what we now call
an "activist" priest.

06:18.512 --> 06:20.113
That doesn't disqualify him.

06:20.147 --> 06:24.184
Legend was back in the late
'60s, Father Campion,

06:24.217 --> 06:27.555
who was an ardent pacifist,
by the way,

06:27.588 --> 06:29.790
became involved in some
of the more radical elements

06:29.823 --> 06:31.124
in the anti-war movement.

06:31.158 --> 06:32.726
Well, I'm confused, Frank.

06:32.760 --> 06:34.895
Now, is this fact or legend?

06:34.928 --> 06:37.865
Was Father Campion ever arrested
and charged?

06:37.898 --> 06:41.068
Why do I think you already
know the answer to that, Terry?

06:41.101 --> 06:44.071
And it still doesn't mean
he didn't break the law.

06:44.104 --> 06:46.440
The benefits that sainthood
for one of our own

06:46.474 --> 06:48.942
would bring to our church
and our city are immeasurable.

06:48.976 --> 06:50.611
Now, if you can't
see that, Frank,

06:50.644 --> 06:52.145
I will simply thank you
for your time.

06:52.179 --> 06:55.449
You are a practicing
Catholic, yes?

06:55.483 --> 06:59.152
I practice, but practice does
not make perfect in my case.

06:59.186 --> 07:02.923
Your Church is asking you
for one small favor

07:02.956 --> 07:06.927
as a practicing Catholic,
not as the sheriff.

07:06.960 --> 07:09.930
Will you please reconsider?

07:11.264 --> 07:13.467
I'm sorry, Monsignor, I can't.

07:17.871 --> 07:22.109
But I can tell you I have lived
here all my life,

07:22.142 --> 07:25.879
and it is almost impossible
to be a saint in this city.

07:39.560 --> 07:40.928
Hello.

07:40.961 --> 07:42.262
It's not enough.

07:42.295 --> 07:43.964
What's not enough?

07:43.997 --> 07:46.667
Whatever it is that you have in
your hand is not enough

07:46.700 --> 07:47.801
for free legal advice.

07:47.835 --> 07:49.770
I'm in pretrial
and I'm way behind.

07:49.803 --> 07:52.740
You mean these red velvet
cupcakes, your favorite,

07:52.773 --> 07:56.777
and the brain food of the
greatest legal minds

07:56.810 --> 07:59.146
everywhere?

07:59.179 --> 08:01.281
Buys you a five-minute retainer.

08:01.314 --> 08:05.052
Okay, good, 'cause it's
about the Carolyn Bynes case.

08:05.085 --> 08:08.522
Sandy Huffman was in,
trying to get us

08:08.556 --> 08:10.023
to charge her stepfather.

08:10.057 --> 08:11.258
If she tries

08:11.291 --> 08:12.526
to get in the building again,

08:12.560 --> 08:13.994
we've asked the guards
to call God.

08:14.027 --> 08:17.230
Yeah, you may want to wait on
making that call.

08:18.331 --> 08:20.267
I was hoping you'd help me get
a search warrant

08:20.300 --> 08:21.535
for Charles Bynes' apartment.

08:21.569 --> 08:23.971
Based on what?

08:24.004 --> 08:26.006
Based on he's had
two wives die on him.

08:26.039 --> 08:28.976
That calls for flowers and
a card, not a search warrant.

08:29.009 --> 08:31.712
Come on, Erin.
His second wife was loaded,

08:31.745 --> 08:33.145
his real estate business
was failing

08:33.179 --> 08:35.248
and he's burned through the
entire inheritance

08:35.282 --> 08:36.884
he got from his first wife.

08:36.917 --> 08:38.284
Still doesn't connect the dots.

08:38.318 --> 08:40.721
Look, this guy is not right.

08:40.754 --> 08:41.955
And you know that how?

08:41.989 --> 08:43.557
What, are you
hearing voices, too?

08:43.591 --> 08:45.659
Yeah, yeah, I am.
I'm hearing intuition.

08:45.693 --> 08:48.161
My detective's intuition,
that's what I'm hearing.

08:49.730 --> 08:50.831
Okay, you know what?

08:50.864 --> 08:53.266
I'll go to Connecticut,

08:53.300 --> 08:55.302
I'll investigate the death
of the first wife on my own.

08:55.335 --> 08:56.737
Be my guest.

08:56.770 --> 09:00.207
But the M.E. report shows
that she died

09:00.240 --> 09:02.175
of a heart attack,
end of story.

09:02.209 --> 09:03.110
And the vial

09:03.143 --> 09:05.112
that was found
next to her body contained

09:05.145 --> 09:07.214
the medication she was taking
for MS, nothing more.

09:07.247 --> 09:09.182
Enjoy your cupcakes.

09:11.051 --> 09:12.886
You really think this woman
talks to God?

09:12.920 --> 09:14.287
Wh... Why not?

09:14.321 --> 09:16.990
I mean, God told Noah
to build a boat, didn't he?

09:17.024 --> 09:19.326
He speaks to people in
the Bible all the time.

09:19.359 --> 09:20.961
Who knows? Maybe he did
speak to her.

09:20.994 --> 09:22.295
This isn't the Bible.

09:22.329 --> 09:24.598
Right.

09:28.301 --> 09:31.238
MAN:
I heard Mr. Bynes'
second wife died.

09:31.271 --> 09:33.340
If you see him, please give
him my condolences.

09:33.373 --> 09:36.276
So you know him?
You remember Mr. Bynes?

09:36.309 --> 09:38.078
I was lead on his first
wife's suicide.

09:38.111 --> 09:40.280
And before that, he was co-chair
of our annual fundraiser.

09:40.313 --> 09:42.215
He donate much?
Yeah.

09:42.249 --> 09:43.917
Some of the people with
money around here,

09:43.951 --> 09:46.219
they treat the police like their
personal rent-a-cop:

09:46.253 --> 09:47.087
"My dog ran away.

09:47.120 --> 09:48.689
Could you find him and
drive him home?"

09:48.722 --> 09:50.357
Oh, you have no idea.

09:50.390 --> 09:52.259
But Mr. Bynes
wasn't like that?

09:52.292 --> 09:53.927
No. Everybody liked him.

09:53.961 --> 09:56.396
It was a shock when
the wife offed herself.

09:56.429 --> 09:58.031
And you're sure
that she liked him?

09:58.065 --> 09:59.733
I think maybe she
was mentally ill.

09:59.767 --> 10:02.903
She took a fistful of sleeping
pills, closed the garage door,

10:02.936 --> 10:05.272
climbed into the Jaguar
and started it up.

10:05.305 --> 10:07.074
Did she leave a suicide note?

10:07.107 --> 10:09.276
No, she didn't.

10:09.309 --> 10:11.879
But you're certain, though, that
she did all this herself?

10:11.912 --> 10:13.146
Yeah.

10:13.180 --> 10:15.315
You thinking we missed
a homicide?

10:15.348 --> 10:16.383
I don't know.

10:16.416 --> 10:18.285
Mr. Bynes is batting a thousand
burying his wives.

10:18.318 --> 10:19.286
What do you think?

10:19.319 --> 10:20.387
I can count sleeping pills

10:20.420 --> 10:21.321
missing from
a prescription bottle,

10:21.354 --> 10:23.691
find fingerprints on
a garage door opener.

10:23.724 --> 10:25.158
Come on.
She lived in the house.

10:25.192 --> 10:26.927
You would have found her
fingerprints everywhere.

10:26.960 --> 10:30.330
Where was Mr. Bynes when the
suicide took place, huh?

10:30.363 --> 10:32.265
Oh, right, I forgot to tell you.

10:32.299 --> 10:33.701
He was at the arsenic store.

10:33.734 --> 10:35.168
Oh, that's funny.

10:35.202 --> 10:37.838
Okay, okay, listen,
we're just asking you since...

10:37.871 --> 10:39.106
...since you're New York City
detectives

10:39.139 --> 10:40.841
and I'm just the hick
cop whose job consists

10:40.874 --> 10:42.409
of chasing drunk kids off
the golf course.

10:42.442 --> 10:43.376
That sounds about right to me.

10:43.410 --> 10:45.178
Uh, look, we just
want to know

10:45.212 --> 10:47.347
if you've ruled him out;
that's it.

10:47.380 --> 10:49.016
Yeah.

10:49.049 --> 10:50.350
We ruled him out

10:50.383 --> 10:52.385
Completely.
Mm-hmm.

10:52.419 --> 10:54.922
Anything else
you want to know?
Yeah.

10:54.955 --> 10:56.890
Do you get paid
to cover up, or do you like

10:56.924 --> 10:58.759
getting tickled behind the ears
once in a while?

11:00.227 --> 11:03.430
On your way out of
town, Detectives,

11:03.463 --> 11:05.165
better make sure you mind
our speed limits.

11:05.198 --> 11:08.836
We got some pretty strict
traffic enforcement around here.

11:08.869 --> 11:10.037
Awesome.

11:10.070 --> 11:11.772
Well, aside from
making a new friend,

11:11.805 --> 11:13.140
that was a dead end.

11:13.173 --> 11:13.941
There's a difference between

11:13.974 --> 11:15.776
a dead end
and a stone wall, partner.

11:15.809 --> 11:17.277
Let it go, man.

11:24.017 --> 11:26.453
I got you the contact info
for that retired detective.

11:26.486 --> 11:27.988
Thank you, Baker.

11:28.021 --> 11:29.456
Is he a snowbird?
No, sir.

11:29.489 --> 11:31.191
He lives year round
on the Jersey shore.

11:31.224 --> 11:32.492
I'm happy to call him for you.

11:32.525 --> 11:34.061
No, it's a personal matter.

11:34.094 --> 11:35.495
I realize that, sir,
I'm just offering...

11:35.528 --> 11:36.997
No, thank you.

11:39.767 --> 11:41.735
I'm sorry, Baker.

11:43.503 --> 11:45.338
If I told the archbishop
I wouldn't do it,

11:45.372 --> 11:47.007
why am I looking into it?

11:47.040 --> 11:49.342
Well, yes.

11:49.376 --> 11:51.879
For myself.

11:51.912 --> 11:53.914
Did you know this priest well?

11:53.947 --> 11:56.083
I served Father Bill's masses
as his altar boy,

11:56.116 --> 11:57.818
he was my first
basketball coach.

11:57.851 --> 11:59.319
I looked up to him.

12:00.921 --> 12:03.256
I joined the Marines
and became a cop,

12:03.290 --> 12:06.459
he radicalized
and probably did a lot more

12:06.493 --> 12:08.295
than just protest the war.

12:08.328 --> 12:09.429
I felt betrayed.

12:09.462 --> 12:13.967
I'm not a Catholic, so I don't
really know the rules.

12:14.001 --> 12:16.736
Well, I am a Catholic.

12:18.538 --> 12:21.441
I did the right thing
saying no to the archbishop,

12:21.474 --> 12:23.543
but... in matters of faith,

12:23.576 --> 12:27.180
I think it's pretty important
to come clean with yourself.

12:28.949 --> 12:32.419
I have to make sure I said no
for the right reasons.

12:43.563 --> 12:45.498
If this is about my
stepdaughter's accusations....

12:45.532 --> 12:46.533
It's all right,
it's all right.

12:46.566 --> 12:48.435
Why don't you have
a seat, sir, okay?

12:48.468 --> 12:50.503
Sometimes this stuff comes up,
and when it does,

12:50.537 --> 12:52.505
we just have to follow up,
you understand.

12:52.539 --> 12:53.373
Go ahead, sit down.

12:53.406 --> 12:55.876
Well, do what
you have to do, but...

12:55.909 --> 12:58.111
I'm afraid Sandy's
mentally unstable.

12:58.145 --> 13:00.147
When she was in her
sophomore year in college,

13:00.180 --> 13:03.383
she attacked her economics
professor because God told her

13:03.416 --> 13:05.352
he was a sinner
from another planet.

13:05.385 --> 13:06.453
Really?

13:06.486 --> 13:09.089
She's been institutionalized
at Saddle Rock three times

13:09.122 --> 13:11.224
in the last five years
for paranoid delusions.

13:11.258 --> 13:14.027
And clearly doesn't
like you very much.

13:14.061 --> 13:18.198
I stepped into her father's
place in her mother's life.

13:18.231 --> 13:20.400
And I encouraged her mother
not to coddle her.

13:20.433 --> 13:22.469
I thought having to work
for a living would focus

13:22.502 --> 13:25.038
Sandy's attention on things
that were real.

13:25.072 --> 13:27.474
Well, ironically, it's you
who's not gonna have to work for

13:27.507 --> 13:29.509
a living anymore now that you've
inherited your wife's money.

13:32.145 --> 13:35.182
I know how this looks.

13:35.215 --> 13:37.317
My money troubles
aren't a secret,

13:37.350 --> 13:40.053
Carolyn and I had
separate finances,

13:40.087 --> 13:42.055
she had a large sum
from her first husband.

13:42.089 --> 13:43.623
But...

13:43.656 --> 13:45.392
This is the second time
this happened for you.

13:45.425 --> 13:46.626
Didn't happen for me,

13:46.659 --> 13:50.097
this happened to me.

13:50.130 --> 13:52.599
Has either of you
ever lost someone close?

13:55.502 --> 13:58.538
I loved my wife very much.

13:58.571 --> 14:00.607
Yesterday, I lost her.

14:00.640 --> 14:01.841
Okay?

14:03.676 --> 14:05.278
One last question.

14:05.312 --> 14:09.282
Um, what exactly did you
go home for yesterday?

14:09.316 --> 14:10.617
I-I told you.

14:10.650 --> 14:12.219
To check on Carolyn.

14:12.252 --> 14:13.586
Anyway, I live there.

14:13.620 --> 14:15.989
The real question is
what was Sandy doing there?

14:16.023 --> 14:17.524
You suggesting
she killed her mother?

14:17.557 --> 14:20.627
If she succeeds in blaming me
for her death,

14:20.660 --> 14:23.196
she'll inherit her mother's
entire fortune.

14:23.230 --> 14:24.397
Right.

14:24.431 --> 14:28.068
But didn't you just finish
telling us that she was insane?

14:28.101 --> 14:30.537
She may be crazy, Detective...

14:30.570 --> 14:32.572
but she's not stupid.

14:41.381 --> 14:43.150
If you'll forgive me,
I've got a funeral to plan.

14:43.183 --> 14:46.119
If there's anything you need,
please don't hesitate to call.

14:46.153 --> 14:46.954
Here... here...

14:46.987 --> 14:48.321
DANNY: Whoa, whoa,
what are you doing?

14:48.355 --> 14:50.657
Hey, you said
you needed proof, right?

14:50.690 --> 14:52.059
Look at this stuff.

14:52.092 --> 14:53.060
Hey, what are
you doing?!

14:53.093 --> 14:54.094
Maybe you'll find it.

14:54.127 --> 14:55.095
This is his.
It's from his apartment.

14:55.128 --> 14:57.330
You broke into my house?!

14:57.364 --> 14:59.199
No, I didn't break in,
I have a key.

14:59.232 --> 15:00.333
Yeah, but you don't
live there, Sandy.

15:00.367 --> 15:02.035
How many times
do we have to tell you?

15:02.069 --> 15:03.036
Here, let me get...

15:03.070 --> 15:04.671
Whoa!
No, do not
let him do that.

15:04.704 --> 15:06.406
Look, these
are my things.

15:06.439 --> 15:07.540
Some of these
are my mother's.

15:07.574 --> 15:08.608
But none of them
belong to you, Sandy.

15:08.641 --> 15:10.110
DANNY:
All right, hold on!

15:10.143 --> 15:11.078
Just wait a minute!

15:11.111 --> 15:12.145
You're saying she stole

15:12.179 --> 15:13.080
all this stuff from you?

15:13.113 --> 15:15.115
Yeah, she stole them.

15:15.148 --> 15:18.018
Okay, um, you know, we're gonna
have to hold this as evidence,

15:18.051 --> 15:19.019
until the D.A. decides
whether or not

15:19.052 --> 15:21.088
to prosecute her for
stealing your belongings.

15:21.121 --> 15:22.322
Are you kidding me?

15:22.355 --> 15:23.690
No, I'm not kidding.

15:23.723 --> 15:25.025
I'm going to have
to call my lawyer.

15:25.058 --> 15:26.126
You do that.

15:27.527 --> 15:29.196
Now we got him, right?

15:41.041 --> 15:42.375
Commissioner Reagan?

15:44.411 --> 15:46.079
Just Frank today.

15:46.113 --> 15:47.614
Walter Loggia.

15:47.647 --> 15:51.184
What are we doing here?

15:51.218 --> 15:53.486
This was my parish
church, as a boy.

15:53.520 --> 15:55.488
I just wanted to get
one last look around

15:55.522 --> 15:56.990
before it becomes a Gap

15:57.024 --> 15:58.758
or whatever it is
they're gonna do with it.

15:58.791 --> 16:00.693
So Campion was your pastor?

16:00.727 --> 16:02.695
In another century, yeah.

16:02.729 --> 16:04.197
Can I be honest?

16:04.231 --> 16:05.365
I wish you would.

16:05.398 --> 16:06.666
Far as I'm concerned,

16:06.699 --> 16:08.601
Campion may have been
a man of God,

16:08.635 --> 16:11.204
but he thought he was
above the laws of man.

16:11.238 --> 16:13.140
He's a dyed-in-the-wool radical

16:13.173 --> 16:14.641
hiding behind his vestments.

16:14.674 --> 16:17.444
Now, look, everything
I tell you is gonna be true.

16:17.477 --> 16:19.346
But you gotta give me your word

16:19.379 --> 16:21.648
this is not gonna
come back to bite me.

16:21.681 --> 16:23.716
I'm not here as the PC.
You have my word.

16:23.750 --> 16:25.152
All right,
then what are you doing

16:25.185 --> 16:27.220
following up
on a cold case like this?

16:29.122 --> 16:31.258
Satisfying a curiosity.

16:31.291 --> 16:33.060
Okay.

16:33.093 --> 16:36.063
I kept copies of all my old
cold case files.

16:36.096 --> 16:37.797
It's all in here.

16:37.830 --> 16:39.532
Including Campion's.

16:39.566 --> 16:41.101
You Catholic?

16:41.134 --> 16:43.603
Christmas, Easter.

16:43.636 --> 16:45.338
It's Father Campion.

16:45.372 --> 16:49.676
Campion took the confession
of David Cummings,

16:49.709 --> 16:51.578
a college student that we liked
for the bombing

16:51.611 --> 16:53.413
of an ROTC recruiting station.

16:53.446 --> 16:55.115
Liked, but didn't have
enough evidence on?

16:55.148 --> 16:56.116
No, we were
getting there.

16:56.149 --> 16:58.451
But Campion, you see,
he left the rectory here

16:58.485 --> 16:59.719
at approximately
3:30 in the morning,

16:59.752 --> 17:02.489
picked up the fugitive Cummings
from another rectory in Pelham

17:02.522 --> 17:04.824
and drove him
to the Canadian border

17:04.857 --> 17:07.194
near Kingston.

17:07.227 --> 17:08.828
Why didn't you stop them?

17:08.861 --> 17:11.631
Because we got the information
from a wiretap on Campion

17:11.664 --> 17:13.566
that we didn't have
a warrant for.

17:13.599 --> 17:16.203
Well, Cummings was a fugitive.

17:16.236 --> 17:18.238
You didn't need a warrant
to pick him up.

17:18.271 --> 17:20.839
We learned this after the fact.

17:20.873 --> 17:22.775
After Campion helped
the criminal flee.

17:22.809 --> 17:25.112
And probably after
the archdiocese reached out

17:25.145 --> 17:26.546
to the mayor's office
and our department.

17:26.579 --> 17:27.547
But this is all in there.

17:27.579 --> 17:29.349
Everything in there is exactly
as I reported it

17:29.382 --> 17:30.350
in my case files.

17:30.383 --> 17:31.718
The bottom line is

17:31.751 --> 17:32.885
he got away with it.

17:32.919 --> 17:36.223
And what do you call putting
an illegal wiretap on him?

17:36.256 --> 17:38.225
In this case?

17:38.258 --> 17:39.726
The right thing to do.

17:41.728 --> 17:43.530
Thought you'd say that.

17:45.132 --> 17:47.267
I'll keep this.

17:54.907 --> 17:57.244
Okay, used
interferon vial.

17:57.277 --> 17:59.279
We'll run that for prints
and check for residue.

17:59.312 --> 18:00.647
You know, knock yourself out.

18:00.680 --> 18:03.316
You know, Bynes might have
a point with Sandy.

18:03.350 --> 18:04.817
She's building a hell of

18:04.851 --> 18:07.620
an insanity defense in case she
ever gets charged with murder.

18:07.654 --> 18:08.855
Yeah, but she's
not the one

18:08.888 --> 18:10.490
living it up off her
dead mother's money.

18:10.523 --> 18:12.292
Look at this.

18:12.325 --> 18:13.760
Dinner, Tribeca restaurant:
$600.

18:13.793 --> 18:16.796
Shoes, Bergdorf
men's department: $750.

18:16.829 --> 18:19.799
Paying it off with your dead
wife's fortune: priceless.

18:19.832 --> 18:20.800
Priceless.

18:20.833 --> 18:21.601
ERIN:
Is that the material

18:21.634 --> 18:22.735
that was taken
from the apartment

18:22.769 --> 18:25.672
without a warrant, which I
told you you couldn't get?

18:25.705 --> 18:26.739
It's evidence in a burglary.

18:26.773 --> 18:28.175
Right.

18:28.208 --> 18:29.576
Whoa, wait. He didn't take it.

18:29.609 --> 18:32.179
Seriously, she came and
she dumped it all on his desk.

18:32.212 --> 18:34.381
Which she stole.
Can I have a word with you?

18:35.215 --> 18:37.150
(mouthing)

18:38.951 --> 18:41.421
What, you, uh, speak to
Bynes's attorney or something?

18:41.454 --> 18:42.922
No, he called the DA.

18:42.955 --> 18:46.193
The DA sent me on a theory
that I'm the ADA

18:46.226 --> 18:48.795
that my brother is least likely
to throw out a window.

18:48.828 --> 18:51.364
Well, that is, as of yet,
an untested theory, sis.

18:51.398 --> 18:54.267
And, uh, the last I heard,
we can use this stuff

18:54.301 --> 18:56.303
that's obtained illegally,
as long as we didn't

18:56.336 --> 18:57.670
illegally obtain it ourselves.

18:57.704 --> 19:00.407
Right. Except Bynes's lawyer
is claiming

19:00.440 --> 19:02.275
that you put the stepdaughter
up to it.

19:02.309 --> 19:03.276
So it's off-limits.

19:03.310 --> 19:04.311
Whoa, hold on.

19:04.344 --> 19:05.645
We didn't put her
up to anything.

19:05.678 --> 19:07.347
We had no idea
what she was doing.

19:07.380 --> 19:09.382
You didn't happen to mention
how nice it would be

19:09.416 --> 19:11.284
to have some proof
on the stepfather?

19:11.318 --> 19:13.286
No, no, no, no,
all I said to her was

19:13.320 --> 19:15.322
we have no proof
that Bynes was evil.

19:15.355 --> 19:17.790
To a mentally ill young woman
who thinks

19:17.824 --> 19:20.327
God is sending her on missions
to root out evil?

19:20.360 --> 19:22.662
You didn't think that she was
gonna go off and do something?

19:22.695 --> 19:23.696
No.
No.

19:23.730 --> 19:25.265
We didn't tell her
to do anything.

19:25.298 --> 19:26.533
Maybe God told her...

19:26.566 --> 19:28.301
Danny, you need to
give all this stuff

19:28.335 --> 19:29.669
back to him right now.
Okay, all right!

19:29.702 --> 19:30.537
Wait, you two.

19:30.570 --> 19:31.538
Wait, this is weird.

19:31.571 --> 19:33.273
The wife is the one with

19:33.306 --> 19:34.407
the medical problems, right?

19:34.441 --> 19:36.343
So why is Mr. Bynes
seeing a doctor

19:36.376 --> 19:37.810
two, three times a week?

19:37.844 --> 19:39.312
A Dr. Folson.

19:39.346 --> 19:40.980
What is it, a shrink?

19:41.013 --> 19:42.315
St. Victor's Hospital?

19:42.349 --> 19:43.616
I-- seems like
a Park Avenue guy.

19:43.650 --> 19:45.252
DANNY: Okay, you know
what, let's go

19:45.285 --> 19:46.753
introduce ourselves
to this doctor.

19:46.786 --> 19:49.456
Um, Counselor, would you
do us a favor, please?

19:49.489 --> 19:51.458
Could you return
all of these stolen things

19:51.491 --> 19:52.659
to their proper owner?
No. No, no, no, no.

19:52.692 --> 19:53.793
No, I am not doing
this for you.

19:53.826 --> 19:55.462
Danny!

19:55.495 --> 19:57.330
We got to go
investigate a murder.

19:57.364 --> 19:58.865
You-You need to return...

19:58.898 --> 20:01.334
What am I supposed
to do with this?

20:01.368 --> 20:02.469
You can, um, ask God.

20:02.502 --> 20:03.703
He'll tell you what to do.

20:07.874 --> 20:09.342
No, he's not a patient.

20:09.376 --> 20:10.643
I'm an anesthesiologist.

20:10.677 --> 20:12.312
You do know Mr. Bynes.

20:12.345 --> 20:14.481
Yes, I do.
How well do you know him?

20:14.514 --> 20:16.449
Would you mind telling me
why you want to know?

20:16.483 --> 20:18.551
It's just a matter
of routine.

20:18.585 --> 20:21.388
Detective, uh, I'm 40 years old,

20:21.421 --> 20:23.790
I've lived in New York City
for 16 years,

20:23.823 --> 20:26.526
and not once in that time
have the police dropped by

20:26.559 --> 20:27.894
as a matter of routine.

20:27.927 --> 20:30.963
Well, uh, we try to be discreet,
Dr. Folson.

20:30.997 --> 20:32.299
So do I.

20:32.332 --> 20:34.967
My relationship with
Mr. Bynes is personal.

20:35.001 --> 20:36.936
And you haven't given me
any reason why

20:36.969 --> 20:38.338
it shouldn't stay that way.

20:38.371 --> 20:40.473
Are you aware
that Mr. Bynes's wife

20:40.507 --> 20:42.475
died suddenly yesterday morning?

20:42.509 --> 20:43.910
Yes, I heard.

20:43.943 --> 20:45.678
And you're aware that
his, uh, date book shows

20:45.712 --> 20:47.447
he's been visiting you
regularly?

20:48.715 --> 20:51.050
And not looking up at you
from an operating table.

20:51.083 --> 20:53.286
I told you that I know him.

20:53.320 --> 20:54.921
You didn't say how well, though.

20:54.954 --> 20:59.592
Look, I'm very sorry to hear
that Mrs. Bynes is dead,

20:59.626 --> 21:02.429
but I really don't see
how I can help you.

21:02.462 --> 21:04.431
And I'm late for surgery.
Excuse me.

21:04.464 --> 21:06.599
Hmm.

21:06.633 --> 21:08.835
Well, I'd say she was
his girlfriend,

21:08.868 --> 21:11.404
but that'd be stating
the obvious.

21:11.438 --> 21:13.873
And an anesthesiologist,
which means she has access

21:13.906 --> 21:15.475
to a lot of
interesting medication.

21:15.508 --> 21:17.043
Exactly.

21:17.076 --> 21:19.546
Yeah, hey, this is
Detective Reagan.

21:19.579 --> 21:22.382
Do you still have
Carolyn Bynes' body there?

21:22.415 --> 21:24.351
Okay, we need
a full tox screen, all right?

21:24.384 --> 21:26.353
Focus on anything
you can find in a hospital,

21:26.386 --> 21:27.387
any kind of drugs.

21:27.420 --> 21:28.555
All right.

21:30.423 --> 21:31.724
First responders had it right.

21:31.758 --> 21:34.361
Carolyn Bynes had
a heart attack.

21:34.394 --> 21:35.762
Heart attack.

21:35.795 --> 21:37.697
I know you're in
the homicide business,

21:37.730 --> 21:39.999
but is it really bad news
when someone isn't murdered?

21:40.032 --> 21:41.401
Of course not.

21:41.434 --> 21:42.535
But it's just...

21:42.569 --> 21:44.070
I think she was murdered, too.

21:44.103 --> 21:46.439
Are you playing
with us, Doc?

21:46.473 --> 21:47.407
She had a heart attack.

21:47.440 --> 21:49.509
Question is,
what caused the heart attack?

21:50.477 --> 21:51.544
You ever hear of fentanyl?

21:51.578 --> 21:52.879
Yeah. Fun stuff.

21:52.912 --> 21:55.382
A hundred times more potent
than morphine.

21:55.415 --> 21:58.084
All right, so you're saying
our DOA...

21:58.117 --> 22:00.086
Fentanyl in her blood.
Probably injected.

22:01.588 --> 22:03.490
It's used in hospitals
all the time,

22:03.523 --> 22:04.924
mostly by anesthesiologists.

22:04.957 --> 22:06.526
Right.

22:06.559 --> 22:07.860
Lovely.

22:24.143 --> 22:25.912
Commissioner,
His Excellency is here.

22:27.013 --> 22:28.681
Terry, what a surprise.

22:28.715 --> 22:30.617
Afternoon, Frank.
I hope I'm not interrupting.

22:30.650 --> 22:33.019
I won't take up your time,
but I bring good news

22:33.052 --> 22:34.954
and I wanted to deliver it
personally.

22:34.987 --> 22:36.689
Well, I can always
use more of that.

22:36.723 --> 22:37.790
Sit down.

22:37.824 --> 22:40.593
Thank you.
Thank you, thank you.

22:40.627 --> 22:43.963
Um, Monsignor Ferraro's
medical investigation

22:43.996 --> 22:45.965
is completed.

22:45.998 --> 22:48.835
And, while it's
not official--

22:48.868 --> 22:50.870
the Vatican moves
like Midtown traffic--

22:50.903 --> 22:53.873
he's confident the miracle will
be confirmed.

22:53.906 --> 22:56.142
And how's that work?

22:56.175 --> 22:58.077
Well, the doctors
involved in the case

22:58.110 --> 22:59.278
were clear in
their confirmation:

22:59.311 --> 23:01.948
the boy's tumor disappeared
and they can't explain why.

23:01.981 --> 23:04.150
So... it's a miracle?

23:04.183 --> 23:06.018
We believe it was.

23:06.052 --> 23:08.955
You know, I had a cinnamon bun
this morning

23:08.988 --> 23:11.491
I swear looked
just like Mother Teresa.

23:11.524 --> 23:15.127
I should also tell you
evidence of a second miracle,

23:15.161 --> 23:16.929
another case
of unexplained recovery

23:16.963 --> 23:18.064
from pancreatic cancer,
attributable...

23:18.097 --> 23:20.099
Look, Terry...

23:20.132 --> 23:21.668
...to Father Campion's
intercession, has come to light.

23:21.701 --> 23:23.069
And Frank, Frank,
do you know the cause

23:23.102 --> 23:25.137
of Father Campion's own death?

23:26.839 --> 23:28.475
Let me guess.

23:28.508 --> 23:30.577
Pancreatic cancer.

23:32.645 --> 23:34.981
I never would have taken you
for a doubting Thomas, Frank.

23:35.014 --> 23:37.149
This isn't
about God, Terry.

23:37.183 --> 23:39.519
It is about a very old
and powerful institution

23:39.552 --> 23:41.020
that is run by men.

23:41.053 --> 23:42.489
And in my experience,

23:42.522 --> 23:44.457
anything fits that description

23:44.491 --> 23:46.158
usually has an agenda.

23:46.192 --> 23:49.161
Once a cop, I guess.

23:51.263 --> 23:53.533
(sighs)

23:56.135 --> 23:57.904
I get audited
all the time.
DANNY: Uh-huh.

23:57.937 --> 23:59.005
Do you know
the street value

23:59.038 --> 24:00.206
of the pharmaceuticals
in here?

24:00.239 --> 24:02.775
No, I really have no clue,
ma'am.

24:02.809 --> 24:05.244
Me neither, and I never
want to find out.

24:05.277 --> 24:08.147
"Hospital Pharmacy
Missing Drugs With
Street Value Of..."

24:08.180 --> 24:10.617
Hm-mm. What's this
about, anyway?

24:10.650 --> 24:13.520
I'm trying to see if you have
a drug in there called fentanyl.

24:13.553 --> 24:15.588
Sure. Synthetic heroin.

24:15.622 --> 24:17.757
Used as an anesthetic
during surgery.

24:17.790 --> 24:19.025
Right.

24:19.058 --> 24:20.159
And occasionally for joyriding

24:20.192 --> 24:22.629
by anesthesiologists,

24:22.662 --> 24:25.231
which is why
I get audited all the time.

24:25.264 --> 24:28.835
Okay, anesthesiologists
like Dr. Karen Folson?

24:28.868 --> 24:30.770
Dr. Folson?
Yeah.

24:30.803 --> 24:33.640
No, she does the surgery part,
not the joyriding part.

24:33.673 --> 24:35.675
Uh-huh.

24:35.708 --> 24:38.044
You think she misappropriated
some fentanyl?

24:38.077 --> 24:40.146
I don't know. Could she have?

24:40.179 --> 24:41.380
No.

24:41.413 --> 24:44.116
Drugs are checked out in the
morning right before surgery.

24:44.150 --> 24:46.819
Not a gram leaves this room that
isn't headed for the veins

24:46.853 --> 24:48.287
of a specific
designated patient.

24:48.320 --> 24:50.523
All right, all right,
but how can you be sure

24:50.557 --> 24:51.958
the drug always gets
to the patient?

24:51.991 --> 24:54.126
Well, because, if it didn't,
you'd hear the screams

24:54.160 --> 24:55.862
when they cut them open.

24:57.830 --> 25:00.166
Right. Thank you.
Mm-hmm.

25:00.199 --> 25:01.701
No luck with
the pharmacist.

25:01.734 --> 25:04.203
I couldn't pry an aspirin
tablet out of that woman.

25:04.236 --> 25:05.972
JACKIE: So what are we
doing here now?

25:06.005 --> 25:07.173
Well, call me crazy,

25:07.206 --> 25:09.041
but Bynes had to get
the fentanyl from somebody

25:09.075 --> 25:09.976
if he didn't get it

25:10.009 --> 25:11.143
from his anesthesiologist
girlfriend, right?

25:11.177 --> 25:14.213
Uh-huh.
So something told me
check with Sandy Huffman.

25:14.246 --> 25:16.048
Maybe she can come up
with something.

25:16.082 --> 25:17.083
The God Whisperer?

25:17.116 --> 25:19.118
Maybe she heard something,
maybe she saw something,

25:19.151 --> 25:21.287
maybe she doesn't even know
she knows it.

25:21.320 --> 25:23.623
I'm thinking this whole
"talking to God" thing is

25:23.656 --> 25:25.758
just her way of facing things
she's afraid of.

25:25.792 --> 25:27.026
You a shrink now?

25:27.059 --> 25:29.028
Look, she helped us before.
She was right.

25:29.061 --> 25:31.097
Maybe her or God can
help us again.

25:31.130 --> 25:33.165
I hope he doesn't
bring his attorney.

25:33.199 --> 25:34.701
Ha, ha, ha.

25:34.734 --> 25:38.004
DANNY: So, this is where
God spoke to you, huh?

25:38.037 --> 25:39.005
Right over here?

25:39.038 --> 25:41.641
Yeah, I was on a run
and I had stopped to rest.

25:41.674 --> 25:42.742
This city's really
beautiful,

25:42.775 --> 25:44.744
if you take the
time to look at it.

25:44.777 --> 25:46.278
And I was looking
up at the trees.

25:46.312 --> 25:48.280
And that's when
you heard the voice?

25:48.314 --> 25:51.150
As clear as I am hearing yours
right now, yeah.

25:51.183 --> 25:54.186
Okay, well, what exactly did
this voice say to you?

25:54.220 --> 25:57.023
It said that my mother was dead.

25:57.056 --> 25:58.290
That Charles killed her.

25:58.324 --> 26:00.192
Right.

26:00.226 --> 26:03.062
I knew that it was true.
I started to cry.

26:03.095 --> 26:04.296
Okay, did the voice
say anything else to you?

26:04.330 --> 26:06.999
Anything at all?
No.

26:07.033 --> 26:09.936
It hasn't said anything
to you since?
No, no.

26:09.969 --> 26:12.238
Didn't you find anything in
the stuff I brought you?

26:12.271 --> 26:13.840
No, nothing we can use
so far.

26:13.873 --> 26:15.241
DANNY:
No, but what we could use is

26:15.274 --> 26:17.744
a little bit more of your help,
if you can.

26:17.777 --> 26:21.247
(anxious laugh)

26:21.280 --> 26:22.749
It's not like a jukebox

26:22.782 --> 26:24.316
where you can
just press a button

26:24.350 --> 26:25.652
and God starts to talk.

26:25.685 --> 26:27.286
All right, well,
how does it work?

26:27.319 --> 26:28.721
What do you need
to do?

26:28.755 --> 26:29.622
You need to look up
at the tree,

26:29.656 --> 26:31.791
pray, meditate, what?

26:31.824 --> 26:33.292
You think I'm crazy.

26:33.325 --> 26:35.862
No, look, nobody thinks
you're crazy here, all right?

26:35.895 --> 26:37.930
If we thought you were crazy,
we wouldn't be here.

26:37.964 --> 26:39.666
JACKIE:
No, come on. Gear up.

26:39.699 --> 26:41.801
Let's go.
Go. Is it this tree?

26:41.834 --> 26:43.836
All right, you know what?
I'm not doing this.

26:43.870 --> 26:45.071
It does not work like that.

26:45.104 --> 26:46.773
I'm sorry. I don't know
how to talk to God.

26:46.806 --> 26:47.940
All right, all right,
that's enough.

26:47.974 --> 26:49.108
Let's just,
let's just stop.

26:52.111 --> 26:53.212
Berlin.

26:55.214 --> 26:56.315
What?

26:56.348 --> 26:58.384
Berlin.

26:58.417 --> 26:59.986
Wh-What's Berlin?
What are you talking about?

27:00.019 --> 27:01.387
That doesn't make any sense.

27:01.420 --> 27:03.656
No, it doesn't.
God just said, "Berlin"?

27:03.690 --> 27:05.391
Yes.

27:05.424 --> 27:06.959
DANNY:
Okay. Hold on.

27:06.993 --> 27:08.327
Does Berlin
mean anything

27:08.360 --> 27:09.428
to you or to your mother?

27:09.461 --> 27:11.864
Are you from Berlin?
Does she know anyone in Berlin?

27:11.898 --> 27:13.232
No, she didn't travel.

27:13.265 --> 27:15.267
There's no connection to Berlin?

27:16.736 --> 27:19.338
No.

27:19.371 --> 27:21.173
Berlin. All right.

27:25.211 --> 27:26.946
Uncle Danny, if she says
she talks to God,

27:26.979 --> 27:28.114
she's nuts,
no doubt about it.

27:28.147 --> 27:29.749
Amen.

27:29.782 --> 27:31.317
Maybe she is nuts,
I don't know.

27:31.350 --> 27:33.285
But where did we just
come from? Church?

27:33.319 --> 27:35.221
We came from church.
And what did we do there?

27:35.254 --> 27:37.156
We talked to God, right?

27:37.189 --> 27:38.891
Through prayer,
through moments of silence

27:38.925 --> 27:41.460
we ask for forgiveness,
for intervention.

27:41.493 --> 27:43.262
Does that make us nuts?

27:43.295 --> 27:46.398
But none of us are saying
he talked back, right?

27:46.432 --> 27:49.368
I'm not saying he talked back
to the girl either.

27:49.401 --> 27:51.203
She heard something.

27:51.237 --> 27:52.338
When I was in school
up in Boston,

27:52.371 --> 27:53.973
I stopped going to Mass
for a while.

27:54.006 --> 27:57.343
Between studying and classes
and working at the coop,

27:57.376 --> 27:58.410
I didn't have time,

27:58.444 --> 28:01.313
so I'd just kind of talked
to God kind on the fly.

28:01.347 --> 28:02.782
And he gave you
a shout-out back?

28:02.815 --> 28:04.116
Not exactly.

28:04.150 --> 28:05.284
But it was like the
difference between

28:05.317 --> 28:06.919
listening to a professor

28:06.953 --> 28:08.454
with 800 other people in
a lecture hall,

28:08.487 --> 28:10.823
and getting to meet with him
one-on-one in his office.

28:10.857 --> 28:12.458
So you believe God
talks to people.

28:12.491 --> 28:14.093
When it came to deciding
whether or not

28:14.126 --> 28:15.494
to come back home and
join the department?

28:15.527 --> 28:17.263
Yeah, I could hear him.

28:17.296 --> 28:19.966
Yeah, but this Sandy person,
I mean, she's making God out

28:19.999 --> 28:22.434
to be some kind of character
in a Stephen King novel,

28:22.468 --> 28:23.803
giving out these
cryptic clues.

28:23.836 --> 28:25.037
To a mystery, yeah.

28:26.305 --> 28:28.174
Like, is Father Campion a saint?

28:28.207 --> 28:30.142
Because that's
a real mystery to me.

28:30.176 --> 28:32.111
How come?

28:32.144 --> 28:33.412
Well, any priest who could tell

28:33.445 --> 28:36.048
a certain kind of joke
the way he did...

28:36.082 --> 28:37.149
(Erin clears throat)

28:39.485 --> 28:44.223
However, he was the first person
to drive a Volvo before

28:44.256 --> 28:45.357
it was common over here.

28:45.391 --> 28:48.460
Boys, what Pop is trying

28:48.494 --> 28:51.530
to say is Father Bill is
not an obvious choice

28:51.563 --> 28:54.033
when you think about who's
gonna be a saint,

28:54.066 --> 28:55.534
which makes it more of a...

28:55.567 --> 28:56.468
...mystery?

28:56.502 --> 28:57.937
Right.

28:57.970 --> 28:59.138
How do you solve it?

28:59.171 --> 29:00.172
How do you solve it?

29:00.206 --> 29:03.342
Well, you start by walking
a mile in his shoes,

29:03.375 --> 29:07.379
find out what makes him tick,
why he made the choices he did.

29:07.413 --> 29:09.248
I'm feeling like a bad Catholic.

29:09.281 --> 29:10.917
I'm not getting any of this.

29:10.950 --> 29:13.352
Well, faith, sister, faith.

29:13.385 --> 29:15.922
It's kind of like listening
to your heart.

29:15.955 --> 29:17.456
Same kind of thing.

29:17.489 --> 29:20.359
Okay, so when God talks to you,
does He extend

29:20.392 --> 29:22.228
professional courtesy
by calling you "Commissioner"?

29:22.261 --> 29:24.396
No. He calls me "Frankie."

29:24.430 --> 29:27.934
(all laughing)

29:27.967 --> 29:29.501
Not "Francis"?

29:29.535 --> 29:31.337
Okay, well, can you pass
the butter, Frankie?

29:31.370 --> 29:32.338
Not "Francis."

29:32.371 --> 29:35.908
(laughter)

29:39.946 --> 29:40.847
Hey, excuse me.

29:40.880 --> 29:41.814
Hey.
Hey!

29:41.848 --> 29:43.182
What are you
doing here?

29:43.215 --> 29:45.017
I thought Sundays were
sacred for you people.

29:45.051 --> 29:47.319
Yeah, well, I got a call
from the lab.

29:47.353 --> 29:48.855
Turns out those
interferon vials had

29:48.888 --> 29:50.189
Carolyn Bynes'
fingerprints on them,

29:50.222 --> 29:51.490
but not her husband's.

29:51.523 --> 29:53.459
Yeah, but she injects herself.

29:53.492 --> 29:55.962
But the one found next
to her body had her fingerprints

29:55.995 --> 29:57.363
and his fingerprints.

29:57.396 --> 29:58.898
I'm thinking
he switched the vial

29:58.931 --> 30:01.400
after she took the one
he loaded with fentanyl.

30:01.433 --> 30:03.535
Amazing.

30:03.569 --> 30:05.437
Now what are you doing here
on a Sunday?

30:05.471 --> 30:06.305
They don't pay us overtime

30:06.338 --> 30:07.373
to investigate heart attacks,
Jackie.

30:07.406 --> 30:10.409
Well, I thought maybe God knows
something I don't.

30:10.442 --> 30:12.378
Surprising, but yes,
maybe He does.

30:12.411 --> 30:14.947
What, are you getting religion?

30:14.981 --> 30:17.016
No, I'm just taking it
for a little test drive.

30:17.049 --> 30:18.017
But I was thinking about it.

30:18.050 --> 30:19.251
Berlin, what is Berlin?

30:19.285 --> 30:21.153
It's a city, right?
But what else is it?

30:21.187 --> 30:23.155
A town?

30:23.189 --> 30:25.357
It's a last name.

30:25.391 --> 30:28.260
Who wrote "White Christmas"?
Irving Berlin.

30:28.294 --> 30:30.029
What are you up to?

30:30.062 --> 30:32.031
I've been looking
for anybody named Berlin

30:32.064 --> 30:34.901
associated with Carolyn
or Charles Bynes.

30:34.934 --> 30:36.235
I was looking
at business directories,

30:36.268 --> 30:37.403
their friends on
social Web sites.

30:37.436 --> 30:40.272
And then I thought,
"Obituaries."

30:40.306 --> 30:42.508
Look what I found.

30:42.541 --> 30:44.143
"Harold K. Berlin."

30:44.176 --> 30:45.144
Okay.

30:45.177 --> 30:46.979
Well, I just talked
to his widow.

30:47.013 --> 30:49.481
It seems he died
a few weeks ago,

30:49.515 --> 30:51.650
and three hours before he was
about to have

30:51.683 --> 30:53.019
a triple-bypass surgery.

30:53.052 --> 30:54.887
And guess who's the
anesthesiologist.

30:54.921 --> 30:56.989
Dr. Karen Folson.

30:57.023 --> 30:58.624
Thank you.

30:58.657 --> 31:01.427
All right, my turn
to do a little overtime.

31:01.460 --> 31:03.029
I'm going back to the hospital.

31:03.062 --> 31:05.431
You enjoy the rest
of your Sunday.

31:05.464 --> 31:07.499
Yes, right here.

31:09.568 --> 31:10.536
Dinner with my husband.

31:10.569 --> 31:11.403
I will give you two minutes.

31:11.437 --> 31:14.540
All right.
It's about Dr. Folson again.

31:14.573 --> 31:17.609
I told you that woman is
not a drug addict.

31:17.643 --> 31:19.645
I didn't say she was.
Can you just tell me

31:19.678 --> 31:21.480
what drugs she pulled
two weeks ago Monday?

31:21.513 --> 31:23.082
I'm not seeing a subpoena.

31:23.115 --> 31:25.217
Okay, read the records, okay?

31:25.251 --> 31:27.186
You look at it,
I'll guess what it says,

31:27.219 --> 31:28.620
you tell me I'm right or wrong.

31:30.322 --> 31:33.359
Please? This is very important.

31:36.628 --> 31:38.965
And can you open the door?

31:38.998 --> 31:41.200
I don't want to talk
through the glass.

31:41.233 --> 31:42.668
Mm. Really?

31:44.436 --> 31:45.404
Don't worry.
This will be quick.

31:45.437 --> 31:47.639
You'll be on your way
to dinner in no time.

31:47.673 --> 31:49.075
It better.
You got the records?

31:49.108 --> 31:50.476
Yeah.
Okay.

31:50.509 --> 31:52.278
Dr. Folson pulled an O.R. tray

31:52.311 --> 31:54.213
for a heart patient
named Harold Berlin.

31:54.246 --> 31:57.316
How am I doing so far?

31:57.349 --> 31:58.650
Go on.

31:58.684 --> 32:00.352
There's no more to tell.

32:00.386 --> 32:02.488
Harold Berlin died three hours
before the operation took place.

32:02.521 --> 32:03.622
He did?

32:03.655 --> 32:05.191
Now do your doctors typically

32:05.224 --> 32:07.259
inject these drugs
into people who are dead?

32:07.293 --> 32:09.628
Of course not.

32:09.661 --> 32:13.532
Okay, so the question is:
did Dr. Folson return the drugs

32:13.565 --> 32:16.135
that she was supposed to use
for Harold Berlin?

32:24.710 --> 32:26.378
No, she didn't.

32:26.412 --> 32:28.247
Enjoy your dinner.

32:38.457 --> 32:40.459
*

32:55.774 --> 32:58.044
I'm Frank.

32:58.077 --> 33:00.479
Thanks for coming.

33:04.750 --> 33:07.053
You can call me David.

33:08.387 --> 33:11.257
Although it's been a while
since anyone else has.

33:11.290 --> 33:13.325
Yeah.

33:13.359 --> 33:17.429
But I gather it's David's story
you wanted to talk to me about.

33:17.463 --> 33:19.765
You don't know who I am, do you?

33:19.798 --> 33:21.733
Oh, some kind of law, I'd guess.

33:21.767 --> 33:23.602
That obvious?

33:25.271 --> 33:27.639
And yet, here you are.

33:28.674 --> 33:31.210
I was told
there was no risk.

33:31.243 --> 33:34.380
That you suggested
meeting in a sanctuary.

33:34.413 --> 33:37.616
I was also told this
was about Father Campion.

33:37.649 --> 33:39.418
True on both counts.

33:39.451 --> 33:41.220
How can I help you, Frank?

33:43.389 --> 33:46.492
Was Father Campion aware
of what you'd done

33:46.525 --> 33:48.394
when he helped you
evade the authorities

33:48.427 --> 33:50.129
and get into Canada?

33:50.162 --> 33:51.563
He was well aware.

33:51.597 --> 33:54.800
I'd confessed
the action to him,

33:54.833 --> 33:57.836
and he arranged for me
to get across the border.

33:57.869 --> 33:59.738
Why would he do that?

34:01.873 --> 34:05.144
I can tell you how he came
to the decision.

34:07.746 --> 34:11.183
Father Campion was close
to a woman in his parish--

34:11.217 --> 34:13.085
a single mother of two sons

34:13.119 --> 34:16.522
who'd been drafted
and were over in Vietnam.

34:16.554 --> 34:18.724
He sought her counsel.

34:18.757 --> 34:20.792
By what license?

34:20.826 --> 34:22.860
He asked me
if I was willing

34:22.893 --> 34:25.531
to abide by what
she thought was just.

34:25.563 --> 34:27.266
Do you understand?

34:27.299 --> 34:30.369
No, not really.

34:30.402 --> 34:33.804
Well, Father Campion
was putting me to the test.

34:33.839 --> 34:37.243
He asked me to place myself
at the mercy

34:37.275 --> 34:41.347
of a woman who should have
a genuine say in the matter.

34:41.380 --> 34:43.215
A proud mother
of two soldiers.

34:43.248 --> 34:46.185
And then he decided
you should go free?

34:46.217 --> 34:48.520
No.

34:48.554 --> 34:53.159
He told me I had the choice
between prison and exile.

34:54.826 --> 34:56.661
That's very different
from free.

34:56.695 --> 34:59.598
And you believed he
had that authority?

34:59.631 --> 35:01.667
Oh, ask anybody
who knew him.

35:01.700 --> 35:03.835
He was one
of those people

35:03.869 --> 35:06.172
you just trusted
above all else.

35:06.205 --> 35:09.841
And if you prayed to God--
and I still do--

35:09.875 --> 35:13.179
it's William Campion
you hope is listening with him.

35:13.212 --> 35:14.380
What can you tell me

35:14.413 --> 35:15.914
about his relationship
with the woman?

35:15.947 --> 35:17.783
Simple.

35:17.816 --> 35:20.619
I've never seen two people
more in love.

35:21.653 --> 35:23.322
But he was
her priest,

35:23.355 --> 35:25.191
and she was his parishioner,

35:25.224 --> 35:27.193
and that was their cross
to bear.

35:27.226 --> 35:29.628
He talked about her
on the drive up.

35:29.661 --> 35:32.198
He said he was grateful to God
for the challenge.

35:32.231 --> 35:33.365
He just wished the challenge

35:33.399 --> 35:35.167
didn't have
such a great pair of legs.

35:39.238 --> 35:40.572
Anything else?

35:40.606 --> 35:42.608
No. I think that covers it.

35:42.641 --> 35:44.343
Well, whatever it is
you're looking for,

35:44.376 --> 35:47.179
I hope that helps.

35:47.213 --> 35:49.315
William Campion was no saint,

35:49.348 --> 35:51.883
but he was a better man
than most.

35:51.917 --> 35:53.652
(sighs)

35:53.685 --> 35:54.886
Thank you.

36:14.005 --> 36:15.807
(knocking)

36:18.977 --> 36:20.579
Doctor.

36:20.612 --> 36:21.947
Oh, Mr. Bynes.

36:23.415 --> 36:24.816
This another routine visit,
Detectives?

36:24.850 --> 36:26.252
No, it's business.

36:26.285 --> 36:27.953
Then why don't you call
tomorrow at my office?

36:27.986 --> 36:29.455
No, actually,
we thought this would be

36:29.488 --> 36:31.757
a great time
to get you two together.

36:31.790 --> 36:33.492
How are those funeral plans
working out for you, sir?

36:33.525 --> 36:36.728
Oh, I think I've been patient
with this long enough.

36:36.762 --> 36:37.929
Would you like
the phone number

36:37.963 --> 36:40.266
of my stepdaughter's
psychiatrist?

36:40.299 --> 36:41.933
Charles, why don't you
just call your lawyer, okay?

36:41.967 --> 36:43.635
Thank you.
A-A-Actually...

36:43.669 --> 36:45.003
we wanted to
talk to you,

36:45.036 --> 36:46.405
since you're facing

36:46.438 --> 36:48.307
some serious
criminal charges.

36:48.340 --> 36:49.575
What are you talking about?

36:49.608 --> 36:50.842
Sale of a narcotics, sir.

36:50.876 --> 36:52.344
DANNY:
Well, you know,
the fentanyl

36:52.378 --> 36:53.712
that you checked out
from the hospital

36:53.745 --> 36:55.013
for an operation
that never happened,

36:55.046 --> 36:56.582
but then you failed
to return it?

36:56.615 --> 36:57.583
What operation?

36:57.616 --> 37:00.286
Well, the one on Harold
Berlin two weeks ago.

37:00.319 --> 37:03.722
The O.R. pharmacist--
she confirmed it for us.

37:03.755 --> 37:05.591
Then she is mistaken--
or it's in my office.

37:05.624 --> 37:06.825
Don't talk
to them, Karen.

37:06.858 --> 37:08.527
They're just trying
to scare you.

37:08.560 --> 37:09.495
Well, losing
her medical license,

37:09.528 --> 37:12.264
two years in prison--
that would scare me.

37:12.298 --> 37:13.632
Or 25 to life for murder.

37:13.665 --> 37:15.434
That would
sure scare me.

37:15.467 --> 37:17.903
You must have really wanted
to marry this guy bad, huh?

37:17.936 --> 37:18.970
Murder?
Yeah, murder.

37:19.004 --> 37:20.439
The tox screen
on his wife

37:20.472 --> 37:23.442
came back, and it showed
fentanyl in her body.

37:23.475 --> 37:25.444
She injected it in herself
instead of the drug

37:25.477 --> 37:27.313
that she's supposed
to be taking for MS

37:27.346 --> 37:29.281
when he switched the vials.

37:29.315 --> 37:30.749
She died of a heart attack.

37:32.318 --> 37:33.852
The M.E. revised
the cause of death.

37:33.885 --> 37:35.454
So now the only
question is--

37:35.487 --> 37:36.788
did he kill her,

37:36.822 --> 37:39.291
or did you kill her?

37:39.325 --> 37:40.626
But, you know,
if you gave him that drug,

37:40.659 --> 37:41.927
it still counts as a sale, Doc.

37:43.829 --> 37:46.064
You want to tell
us what happened?
Karen, don't say anything.

37:46.097 --> 37:47.866
Sir, why don't you just
stay where we can see you?

37:47.899 --> 37:49.735
All right? And keep your hands
where we can see them as well.

37:49.768 --> 37:52.471
You do know
that his first wife died.

37:52.504 --> 37:55.374
Do you want to be on
deck for number three?

37:58.109 --> 37:59.645
JACKIE:
Listen, just tell me

37:59.678 --> 38:00.812
what happened with the fentanyl.

38:04.816 --> 38:06.352
Charles has a herniated disk.

38:06.385 --> 38:08.987
And when it flares up,
the pain can be excruciating.

38:09.020 --> 38:10.356
Karen!
His doctor

38:10.389 --> 38:12.324
prescribed him
pain medicine,

38:12.358 --> 38:14.092
but Charles ran out,
his doctor was out of town.

38:14.125 --> 38:15.093
I... Tell them, Charles.

38:15.126 --> 38:16.595
I'm calling my lawyer.

38:16.628 --> 38:17.996
DANNY:
Yeah, come on, Charles.

38:18.029 --> 38:19.097
Tell us all about it.

38:19.130 --> 38:21.400
He just needed something
to tide him over, that's...

38:21.433 --> 38:22.668
Karen!
For God's sake,

38:22.701 --> 38:24.436
that's enough.

38:24.470 --> 38:26.338
Charles, you can tell them
what your doctor said.

38:26.372 --> 38:27.706
You can show them
the prescriptions.

38:27.739 --> 38:29.341
What-what he said
about managing your pain.

38:29.375 --> 38:31.443
Karen...

38:31.477 --> 38:35.481
just... stop... talking.

38:45.524 --> 38:47.759
I-I didn't...

38:47.793 --> 38:50.429
I didn't want to give him
the fentanyl at first,

38:50.462 --> 38:52.598
because...

38:52.631 --> 38:54.132
I was worried
about him.

38:54.165 --> 38:56.134
Because I cared.

38:56.167 --> 38:58.370
I told him that it
was too dangerous.

38:58.404 --> 39:01.339
I told him it could cause
a heart attack.

39:17.489 --> 39:20.392
And with the full knowledge
of what he was doing,

39:20.426 --> 39:22.093
that's a federal
offense-- at least one.

39:22.127 --> 39:24.696
Could also be framed
as an interpretation

39:24.730 --> 39:26.865
of the pacifist tenets
of Christ's teachings.

39:29.134 --> 39:31.169
There's also anecdotal evidence

39:31.202 --> 39:33.572
that he maintained
a close, personal relationship

39:33.605 --> 39:35.641
with a single mother
in the parish.

39:35.674 --> 39:39.177
Cummings characterized it...

39:39.210 --> 39:41.547
as two people in love.

39:42.981 --> 39:44.516
Is the woman still living?

39:44.550 --> 39:46.452
No. She passed away last year.

39:46.485 --> 39:48.520
Was the relationship
consummated?

39:48.554 --> 39:50.922
Not as far as I know,
but I don't know very far.

39:50.956 --> 39:52.524
As a man,
I can make an assumption.

39:52.558 --> 39:54.025
That won't be necessary.

39:57.195 --> 39:59.197
Well...

39:59.230 --> 40:01.767
the vows of chastity,
as far as I'm concerned,

40:01.800 --> 40:03.469
make you guys all saints

40:03.502 --> 40:04.603
in my book, but, uh,

40:04.636 --> 40:07.539
I assume you're
aiming higher here.

40:08.707 --> 40:10.175
All right, Frank,
uh... thank you

40:10.208 --> 40:11.510
for your input.

40:11.543 --> 40:13.144
Don't I get a vote?

40:13.178 --> 40:14.813
We're not voting here.

40:14.846 --> 40:17.916
I would like to know
what you think, Commissioner.

40:19.217 --> 40:21.086
I think we already know
where the commissioner stands.

40:21.119 --> 40:24.956
Look, like you, I'd be
out of a job without sinners,

40:24.990 --> 40:27.559
so I have
kind of a soft spot for them.

40:27.593 --> 40:29.094
Besides, if you took
all the sinners

40:29.127 --> 40:31.697
out of the pool for sainthood,
you'd be left with who?

40:31.730 --> 40:33.732
Very few.
Exactly.

40:33.765 --> 40:37.636
St. Olga of Kiev
scalded her husband's enemies

40:37.669 --> 40:39.938
and burned villages
that crossed her.

40:41.239 --> 40:42.608
And she's still
on active duty, right?

40:42.641 --> 40:44.476
So to speak.

40:44.510 --> 40:45.677
A lot of them

40:45.711 --> 40:49.715
did a lot worse than go outside
the law in troubled times

40:49.748 --> 40:53.218
to help a misguided kid
get a second chance.

40:53.251 --> 40:55.721
And I think...

40:55.754 --> 40:58.123
the Church could do a lot worse

40:58.156 --> 41:00.526
than St. Bill from Brooklyn.

41:01.560 --> 41:03.529
Does have a nice ring to it.

41:06.665 --> 41:09.501
To me, it comes down to this:
if you told Father Bill

41:09.535 --> 41:10.836
he was a candidate
for sainthood,

41:10.869 --> 41:12.203
he'd laugh his ass off.

41:12.237 --> 41:14.506
(chuckling)

41:14.540 --> 41:16.875
And that's exactly
the kind of saint

41:16.908 --> 41:19.177
the Church needs
to put out there.

41:27.252 --> 41:30.789
I wanted to let you know that,
um, we arrested Charles Bynes.

41:30.822 --> 41:32.524
Thanks to your help.

41:32.558 --> 41:33.525
God's help.

41:33.559 --> 41:35.527
Whoever's help.

41:35.561 --> 41:36.995
I really thought he was
going to get away with it.

41:37.028 --> 41:39.531
Even though God
was on your side, huh?

41:39.565 --> 41:41.533
He just gives me
the information.

41:41.567 --> 41:43.602
He doesn't give me the outcome.

41:43.635 --> 41:45.003
Right. Right.

41:45.036 --> 41:47.573
Look, you going to be all right?

41:47.606 --> 41:49.207
I'm sure He has a plan for me.

41:49.240 --> 41:50.576
I'm sure He does.

41:50.609 --> 41:51.910
Yeah.
Anyway,

41:51.943 --> 41:53.579
it's not going to bring
your mom back,

41:53.612 --> 41:55.313
but at least you got
the inheritance, too.

41:55.346 --> 41:57.816
Money can't buy happiness.

41:57.849 --> 41:59.284
No, but it can buy you

41:59.317 --> 42:02.588
a nice little boat to park
right alongside of happiness.

42:02.621 --> 42:03.822
(laughs quietly)

42:03.855 --> 42:06.191
Do you really believe that?

42:06.224 --> 42:07.859
No.

42:08.326 --> 42:10.896
Then maybe there is hope
for you yet.

42:10.929 --> 42:12.831
Maybe.

42:12.864 --> 42:15.033
See you around, kid.
