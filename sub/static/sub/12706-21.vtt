WEBVTT

00:01.000 --> 00:02.636
Almost time
to wake up, Adam,

00:02.669 --> 00:04.971
take your first look
at the world. I know

00:05.004 --> 00:06.674
you're gonna make me proud.

00:06.705 --> 00:10.711
Aah!
 Previously on
Buffy the Vampire Slayer...

00:10.743 --> 00:12.846
Adam?

00:12.880 --> 00:15.682
Spike, I want you
to come with me.

00:15.715 --> 00:17.818
You're going to help me
with my problem.

00:17.850 --> 00:20.187
The slayer's got pals.
Take them away from her.

00:20.221 --> 00:22.323
This all goes down,
the chip comes out.

00:22.356 --> 00:23.257
Scout's honor.

00:23.291 --> 00:24.757
FORREST:
Riley had a career.

00:24.792 --> 00:26.660
He had a future till he met you.
And, yeah, I got a problem

00:26.693 --> 00:28.161
with that.
(whirring)

00:28.196 --> 00:30.131
Thank you.

00:32.633 --> 00:35.034
Okay, Adam was at that cave. So
maybe he was there for a reason.

00:35.069 --> 00:37.003
I'll go back. I'll scope it out.

00:37.036 --> 00:39.740
You never train with me anymore.
He's going to kick your ass.

00:39.773 --> 00:41.709
Giles.
Stupid?

00:41.741 --> 00:43.743
So you finally had the guts
to say it to my face.

00:43.777 --> 00:45.679
What exactly do you mean
by "witch stuff"?

00:45.713 --> 00:47.280
You guys, what is happening?
Buffy,

00:47.314 --> 00:49.182
things have been wrong
for a while.

00:49.216 --> 00:51.918
I'm starting to understand
why there's no ancient prophecy

00:51.951 --> 00:55.456
about a chosen one
and her friends.

00:55.488 --> 00:58.225
If I need help, I'll go
to someone I can count on.

00:58.259 --> 01:00.194
I've been waiting for you.

01:00.228 --> 01:02.130
And now I'm here.

01:03.131 --> 01:05.965
(crickets chirping)

01:10.069 --> 01:12.472
Riley?

01:21.149 --> 01:23.551
Riley.

01:23.584 --> 01:25.085
Your thoughts
are troubled.

01:25.118 --> 01:28.087
In turmoil.

01:28.121 --> 01:31.024
I understand, brother.
We have a lot to discuss.

01:34.762 --> 01:35.628
Speak.

01:35.662 --> 01:37.063
What have you done to me?

01:37.097 --> 01:39.932
Nothing.

01:39.966 --> 01:42.002
It was Mother.
Your...

01:42.034 --> 01:46.939
Professor Walsh. She implanted
the behavior modifier.

01:46.973 --> 01:50.578
A chip in my head.
She really did it.

01:50.610 --> 01:52.412
Actually, the
chip is here,

01:52.445 --> 01:54.247
tied directly into your
central nervous system

01:54.281 --> 01:56.082
through the
thoracic nerve.

01:56.115 --> 01:59.085
This is phase one
of your preparation.

01:59.118 --> 02:01.087
It lay dormant
until the time came.

02:01.120 --> 02:02.822
I simply activated it, brother.

02:02.855 --> 02:05.459
Stop calling me that.
I'm not your brother.

02:05.492 --> 02:07.927
You're a botched
science experiment.

02:07.960 --> 02:10.198
And I'm a human being who's
gonna do everything in his power

02:10.229 --> 02:11.498
to...
Sit.

02:13.800 --> 02:15.302
You have no power.

02:17.670 --> 02:19.639
Not yet.

02:19.673 --> 02:22.643
Once you forget your old life
and embrace your destiny

02:22.675 --> 02:26.146
as I have, you will know power
you've never dreamed of.

02:27.215 --> 02:29.582
I think you're going to like it.

02:33.721 --> 02:36.824
(wolf howling)

02:36.856 --> 02:38.925
*

03:27.307 --> 03:30.377
Demons cling to old ways
and ancient feuds.

03:30.411 --> 03:34.180
And they're hopeless
with technology. Unworthy.

03:34.213 --> 03:36.182
Not really wanting
a lecture right now.

03:36.216 --> 03:39.687
Disappointed by demon-kind,
we turned to humans.

03:39.719 --> 03:44.625
Smart, adaptive but
emotional and weak.

03:44.658 --> 03:49.128
Blind. There's
imperfection everywhere.

03:49.162 --> 03:51.564
Something must be done.

03:51.598 --> 03:53.667
Who will deliver us?

03:56.103 --> 03:57.037
Mother.

03:57.069 --> 03:58.872
She saw our future,

03:58.906 --> 04:01.074
yours and mine.

04:01.108 --> 04:04.076
She saw that you were necessary.

04:04.110 --> 04:08.080
She saw the role
that you will play by my side.

04:08.115 --> 04:09.349
Stand up.

04:10.751 --> 04:13.621
You see,
we are brothers after all.

04:13.653 --> 04:16.223
Warms the cockles
of my non-beating heart

04:16.255 --> 04:17.990
seeing you lads together.

04:18.024 --> 04:19.992
I didn't send
for you, Spike.

04:20.026 --> 04:24.264
Yeah, well, I'm not much
the being-sent-for type.

04:24.298 --> 04:26.934
I'm much more
the, um, "I did my part,

04:26.966 --> 04:29.370
now get this chip out
of my head" kind of guy.

04:33.273 --> 04:36.343
Slightly stiffer than usual.

04:38.278 --> 04:40.480
Subtle but I like it.

04:40.514 --> 04:41.981
What's with him?

04:42.014 --> 04:43.651
I activated
his chip.

04:43.683 --> 04:46.653
Oh. So it's chips
all around, is it?

04:46.687 --> 04:49.255
Someone must've bought
the party pack.

04:49.288 --> 04:52.625
You get yours removed when
the slayer is where I want her.

04:52.659 --> 04:54.461
She's separated
from her friends.

04:54.495 --> 04:57.029
They want nothing
to do with her.

04:57.064 --> 05:00.300
She's all alone.

05:00.334 --> 05:01.935
That's how I want her.

05:01.968 --> 05:05.038
Where I want her is down
in the Initiative.

05:05.072 --> 05:07.040
She will ensure
that as many demons

05:07.074 --> 05:08.875
die as humans.

05:08.908 --> 05:12.312
She will achieve maximum carnage
before she's too weak to go on.

05:12.346 --> 05:13.480
No. You can't...

05:13.514 --> 05:14.648
Stop talking.

05:18.485 --> 05:20.353
Right. The Initiative.

05:20.387 --> 05:22.288
But getting her there--
that's what the bleeding disks

05:22.322 --> 05:24.957
are for, isn't it? Our little
witch gives her the info and,

05:24.992 --> 05:27.293
pop, Alice heads back down
the rabbit hole.

05:27.326 --> 05:28.194
The witch?

05:28.228 --> 05:29.463
Uh, Willow.

05:29.497 --> 05:31.298
About so high, perky,

05:31.331 --> 05:33.966
good with math. Natural choice.

05:34.000 --> 05:36.302
Her friend. One of the friends
Right.

05:36.336 --> 05:38.971
from whom you've
so efficiently separated her.

05:39.005 --> 05:40.807
Damn right I did.
You should've seen 'em.

05:40.841 --> 05:44.343
They won't be talking to each
other for a long, long...

05:46.779 --> 05:48.749
Hang on.

05:48.781 --> 05:51.317
I think I might've detected
a small flaw.

05:51.350 --> 05:52.685
So you failed.

05:52.720 --> 05:54.687
Well, hey,

05:54.721 --> 05:56.189
you're supposed to be so smart.

05:56.223 --> 05:58.257
You let me plan this thing.
(scoffs)

06:00.728 --> 06:02.663
Okay, let's not quibble
about who failed who.

06:02.696 --> 06:04.331
The important thing
is making sure the slayer

06:04.363 --> 06:05.533
is where we want...
Go.

06:05.565 --> 06:07.535
Gone.

06:07.567 --> 06:09.536
(sighs)

06:09.569 --> 06:13.206
So, um, we'll do
this chip thing when I get back.

06:20.146 --> 06:22.182
(knocking)

06:22.214 --> 06:24.418
(sighs)

06:24.451 --> 06:25.786
Hey.

06:25.819 --> 06:27.721
Hello.

06:29.389 --> 06:32.692
Um... Oh. Uh, pardon the robe.

06:32.725 --> 06:34.795
It's a bit of a late start.

06:34.827 --> 06:37.230
Right.

06:37.264 --> 06:40.033
Hope you're feeling
all right, Mr. Giles.

06:40.067 --> 06:43.202
Oh, yes, quite-quite well,
thank you.

06:43.235 --> 06:47.406
Yes, I'll-I'll probably have
a-a brisk jog later on.

06:49.408 --> 06:51.377
Did you want something?

06:51.411 --> 06:53.913
I forgot my laptop
and the disks.

06:53.947 --> 06:56.316
Uh, yes,
please, please, come in.

06:57.685 --> 07:00.319
Uh, will you be
working here,

07:00.353 --> 07:01.488
you know,
typing,

07:01.521 --> 07:03.156
talking?

07:03.189 --> 07:05.559
Because that-that will be fine.

07:05.593 --> 07:07.595
No, that's okay.

07:17.637 --> 07:19.439
Got 'em.

07:19.473 --> 07:22.408
So... see ya.

07:22.442 --> 07:25.444
Right. Yes, well, uh, well,
good luck with-with that.

07:26.446 --> 07:27.880
Okay.

07:29.281 --> 07:31.418
Bye.

07:31.451 --> 07:32.451
Bye.

07:32.485 --> 07:35.021
Bye.

07:41.127 --> 07:43.497
*

08:02.482 --> 08:04.884
(dial tone)

08:19.331 --> 08:21.701
(clang)

08:22.935 --> 08:24.904
(dog barking in distance)

08:24.937 --> 08:27.374
(door shuts)
ANYA:
Xander.

08:29.742 --> 08:31.377
You said you wanted
to check the board

08:31.411 --> 08:33.179
at the unemployment office
this morning.

08:35.783 --> 08:37.350
(sighs)

08:38.619 --> 08:41.020
You can't go like that.

08:41.053 --> 08:43.423
They won't even interview you
if you're naked.

08:43.456 --> 08:45.424
I'm not goin'.

08:45.457 --> 08:47.494
There's never anything good.

08:47.527 --> 08:50.496
(sighs)
Maybe I should join the Army.

08:50.529 --> 08:52.566
Don't they make you get up
really early in the morning?

08:52.600 --> 08:55.067
Oh, yeah.

08:55.101 --> 08:56.870
Never mind.

08:56.903 --> 09:01.374
Are you still upset about that
fight you had with your friends?

09:01.408 --> 09:03.711
It was hours ago. Get over it.

09:03.744 --> 09:05.946
Anya, y...

09:05.979 --> 09:08.014
Forget it.

09:08.048 --> 09:10.417
So they all think you're
a lost, directionless loser

09:10.450 --> 09:13.052
with no plans for his future.
(sputters)

09:13.086 --> 09:15.522
Anya, you can't...
(sputters) that stuff away.

09:15.554 --> 09:16.389
Why not?

09:16.423 --> 09:19.426
I don't know.

09:21.427 --> 09:23.897
'Cause I think
maybe they're right.

09:24.932 --> 09:27.333
(sighs)

09:33.139 --> 09:35.542
So what if they are?

09:35.575 --> 09:38.477
You're a good person and
a good boyfriend and...

09:40.947 --> 09:42.982
...and I'm in love with you.

09:43.015 --> 09:47.855
Whatever they think of you,
it shouldn't matter.

09:50.123 --> 09:52.659
Yeah.

09:52.692 --> 09:55.361
Yeah, it doesn't matter.

10:09.976 --> 10:11.378
(debris falling)

10:32.865 --> 10:35.634
Adam.

10:39.139 --> 10:41.073
Where are you?

10:49.581 --> 10:52.820
This is where
it will all happen.

10:52.852 --> 10:55.688
Where the new race
begins.

10:58.158 --> 10:59.726
Where are we?

10:59.759 --> 11:01.660
In the Initiative.

11:01.695 --> 11:04.230
There are areas
no one knew about

11:04.264 --> 11:08.235
beyond those that needed to.

11:08.268 --> 11:11.337
Mother kept her secrets well.

11:14.673 --> 11:15.842
Didn't you?

11:17.376 --> 11:18.846
RILEY:
Professor Walsh?

11:18.879 --> 11:20.679
This is all how she planned it,

11:20.713 --> 11:22.282
except she thought
she would be alive.

11:34.527 --> 11:36.428
Are you...

11:38.798 --> 11:40.868
Is that what you're gonna do
to me?

11:40.900 --> 11:42.870
They're just workers.

11:42.903 --> 11:44.504
You know your destiny

11:44.537 --> 11:46.105
is much greater.

11:51.711 --> 11:53.679
Forrest.

11:53.712 --> 11:55.715
Oh, God.

11:56.750 --> 11:59.652
God has nothing to do with it.

12:16.003 --> 12:18.806
Easy, Sheriff. Watch where
you point that thing.

12:18.838 --> 12:20.206
What are you doing here?

12:20.240 --> 12:23.475
Looking for a little
weekend getaway place.

12:23.509 --> 12:24.711
Shove off.

12:24.744 --> 12:26.779
Adam's been using these caves.

12:26.813 --> 12:28.881
What?

12:28.916 --> 12:31.618
I found his lair.

12:31.650 --> 12:34.287
Oh, cripes, that's all I need,

12:34.321 --> 12:36.288
running into that goon.

12:36.322 --> 12:38.758
Yeah, well,
Adam's cleared out of here,

12:38.792 --> 12:40.827
so whatever he's planning
is about to go down.

12:40.860 --> 12:42.995
Look at little Nancy Drew.

12:43.029 --> 12:45.731
What about
those disks I nabbed?

12:45.764 --> 12:47.399
They ought
to tell you something.

12:47.433 --> 12:50.403
Willow has the disks.

12:50.437 --> 12:52.672
Well, I'd get on that.

12:52.705 --> 12:54.606
Can't ignore
valuable information

12:54.640 --> 12:56.876
just 'cause you two birds
fell out now, can you?

12:58.879 --> 13:00.346
Right.

13:00.379 --> 13:02.782
Well, you do what you want.

13:02.816 --> 13:05.518
No worry of mine now, is it?

13:09.056 --> 13:12.759
Maybe you should rest,
clear your head.
Can't.

13:12.792 --> 13:14.760
Not now.
I-I think I'm onto something.

13:14.793 --> 13:16.763
I-I've been assuming that the...

13:16.796 --> 13:19.932
the ciphertext was encrypted
with an asymmetric algorithm.

13:19.966 --> 13:23.036
Then it hit me. A hexagonic
key pattern, it's...

13:23.070 --> 13:24.937
Hey, look. You did it.

13:24.971 --> 13:27.440
(beeping)

13:27.474 --> 13:28.942
I didn't.

13:28.975 --> 13:32.011
I haven't even finished
typing in the new code.

13:32.044 --> 13:34.647
Something's
doing it.

13:34.681 --> 13:38.551
Must be programmed to
self-decrypt at a certain point.

13:38.585 --> 13:41.388
That is so annoying. It-It's
like somebody blurting out

13:41.421 --> 13:43.389
the answer to a riddle
just when you've...

13:43.423 --> 13:47.059
I mean, yippee,
we have the information.

13:47.094 --> 13:49.495
I-I don't know if "yippee"
is the right response either.

13:49.528 --> 13:50.998
Read that.
(phone rings)

13:53.265 --> 13:55.668
Hello?

13:55.701 --> 13:57.904
Yeah, um, she's right...

13:57.937 --> 14:01.341
I mean, let me check.

14:01.374 --> 14:02.841
(quietly):
It's Buffy.

14:04.410 --> 14:07.080
Professor Walsh.

14:08.280 --> 14:11.683
Professor Walsh,
it's Riley Finn.

14:11.717 --> 14:13.753
Can you hear me?

14:13.785 --> 14:15.154
FORREST:
She's dead.

14:15.187 --> 14:16.822
Artificially
reanimated

14:16.855 --> 14:19.591
with basic
to moderate brain activity.

14:19.625 --> 14:23.696
Mommy can hear you, but
she's still a walking corpse.

14:24.898 --> 14:25.831
So are you.

14:25.865 --> 14:27.667
Mm-mm.

14:27.700 --> 14:29.501
Got that wrong.

14:29.536 --> 14:31.504
I'm surging with life

14:31.538 --> 14:33.505
and strength.

14:33.539 --> 14:36.375
Adam made me to be nearly as bad
as he is.

14:36.408 --> 14:38.110
(grunts)

14:38.144 --> 14:42.448
Really looking forward
to trying out your girl again.

14:42.481 --> 14:45.784
I'm sorry, Forrest.
Don't be.

14:45.817 --> 14:48.788
This is the best thing
that ever happened to me.

14:48.821 --> 14:50.856
I'm free of all
my weaknesses,

14:50.889 --> 14:53.759
my doubts.

14:53.793 --> 14:55.861
He's gonna fix you up, too,

14:55.894 --> 14:57.864
soon as we got
some choice parts.

14:57.897 --> 15:00.799
Then you and me'll
be back on the same side,

15:00.832 --> 15:03.903
moving toward a new future.
I'll never let that happen.

15:03.937 --> 15:06.139
You don't get it, brother.
You don't have a choice.

15:07.673 --> 15:10.043
Your will belongs to us now.

15:10.076 --> 15:12.479
No. That's not true.

15:16.482 --> 15:19.318
Then why don't you get out of
that chair and walk out of here?

15:19.351 --> 15:21.388
You can't control my...
WALSH:
Riley,

15:21.421 --> 15:24.191
be a good boy.

15:33.100 --> 15:35.501
(indistinct chatter)

15:49.948 --> 15:51.518
Where's Anya?

15:51.551 --> 15:54.520
Oddly, Anya decided
not to join us,

15:54.553 --> 15:56.923
despite all the fun we had
at our last meeting.

15:56.956 --> 16:00.027
And I don't think
Tara felt welcome.

16:00.059 --> 16:02.461
Why? Because of the things
that we said?

16:03.830 --> 16:05.631
Will, who told you
that we were talking

16:05.664 --> 16:07.167
behind your back, specifically?

16:07.200 --> 16:09.168
Well, I...

16:09.201 --> 16:12.205
Spike, specifically, but...
And who told you

16:12.239 --> 16:13.873
that we thought you'd be
better off joining the Army?

16:13.905 --> 16:15.875
That's not...

16:15.908 --> 16:18.711
exactly what he said.

16:20.147 --> 16:23.115
Well, um,
S-Spike can be very convincing

16:23.149 --> 16:25.184
when-when, uh...

16:25.217 --> 16:27.120
I'm very stupid.

16:27.153 --> 16:30.557
He played us. He wanted us
to fight to split us up.

16:33.692 --> 16:34.961
That's where
it came from,

16:34.994 --> 16:36.796
the stuff we said
the other night.

16:36.828 --> 16:40.533
Of course. Well, piffle.
Let's-let's move on.

16:40.567 --> 16:41.467
I'm movin'.

16:41.500 --> 16:42.634
Me, too.

16:42.668 --> 16:43.936
Good.

16:45.437 --> 16:47.740
Great.

16:53.779 --> 16:57.649
So why do you think Spike
made with the head games?

16:57.683 --> 17:01.421
He's all dressed up with
no one to bite. He's got
to get his ya-yas somehow.

17:01.453 --> 17:03.056
I think it was more than that.

17:03.090 --> 17:04.891
I think it was Adam.

17:06.025 --> 17:07.759
Spike's working for Adam?!

17:07.794 --> 17:11.329
After all we've done...
Nah, I can't even act surprised.

17:11.364 --> 17:13.333
BUFFY:
I just went to Adam's
lair, and he was gone,

17:13.365 --> 17:15.666
but Spike just happened
to be there.

17:15.701 --> 17:17.737
And he made this big noise
about getting the information

17:17.769 --> 17:19.338
off those encrypted disks.

17:19.372 --> 17:20.873
Oh, I decrypted 'em.

17:21.874 --> 17:24.242
Well, they decrypted themselves,

17:24.277 --> 17:26.846
but I almost had it.
What did they say?

17:26.877 --> 17:29.848
Bunch of stuff
we already knew about 314.

17:29.882 --> 17:32.785
But it also said
there's some final phase

17:32.818 --> 17:35.087
where Adam
manufactures a bunch

17:35.122 --> 17:36.888
of creepy
cyber-demonoids

17:36.923 --> 17:40.227
like him. There's a special lab
in the Initiative,

17:40.259 --> 17:42.060
but it didn't say where.

17:42.095 --> 17:44.730
Adam fed Spike those disks.
It has to be.

17:44.763 --> 17:48.300
He wanted me to know about
his evil-guy assembly line.

17:48.335 --> 17:51.471
This lab, it's
in the Initiative?

17:51.503 --> 17:53.240
Hidden somewhere.

17:54.473 --> 17:56.442
Well, give the demon his due.

17:56.476 --> 17:58.510
He thought this one out.

17:59.778 --> 18:01.047
What do you mean?

18:01.079 --> 18:02.714
You know how overcrowded

18:02.749 --> 18:04.584
the containment cells have been
at the Initiative?

18:04.616 --> 18:07.153
Those demons were
just too easy to catch.

18:07.186 --> 18:09.388
It's like they
wanted in that place.

18:09.422 --> 18:11.157
The Trojan horse.

18:11.191 --> 18:13.593
Adam's gonna make sure
the demons attack the Initiative

18:13.625 --> 18:14.826
from the inside.

18:14.861 --> 18:16.663
Demons versus soldiers.

18:16.695 --> 18:18.498
Massacre, massacre.

18:18.530 --> 18:19.731
WILLOW:
And Adam has
a neat pile

18:19.766 --> 18:20.967
of body parts

18:21.000 --> 18:23.001
to start assembling his army.

18:23.035 --> 18:26.173
Diabolical yet... gross.

18:26.205 --> 18:28.607
Does anybody else
miss the mayor,

18:28.641 --> 18:31.178
"I just want to be a big snake"?

18:31.211 --> 18:32.979
I've got to shut him down,
Giles.

18:33.011 --> 18:34.480
His final phase
is about to start.

18:34.513 --> 18:36.249
We need to warn the Initiative.

18:36.282 --> 18:38.084
They're not gonna listen to me.

18:38.116 --> 18:39.085
Riley?

18:39.117 --> 18:40.752
He's a deserter.

18:40.787 --> 18:43.155
He got some bad news, anyway,

18:43.190 --> 18:45.857
and kind of took off.

18:48.194 --> 18:49.828
Okay, I'm confused again.

18:49.862 --> 18:51.463
Adam has this evil plan.

18:51.498 --> 18:53.700
Why is he so anxious
for you to know about it?

18:53.732 --> 18:55.701
He wants me there.

18:55.734 --> 18:58.104
Probably figures
I'll even the kill ratio.

18:58.136 --> 19:01.874
He's not worried you might kill,
oh, say, him?

19:01.907 --> 19:05.811
No. He's really not.

19:05.845 --> 19:08.047
She's coming.

19:08.079 --> 19:09.882
I can feel it.

19:09.915 --> 19:11.518
Good on you.

19:11.550 --> 19:14.487
Got a chunk of Prognosticating
Demon in there, eh?

19:16.154 --> 19:19.959
Now, if you'll just get
this chip out of my cranium,

19:19.991 --> 19:21.961
I'll be out of your way.

19:21.993 --> 19:23.462
And mind the hairline.

19:23.496 --> 19:24.963
I don't fancy fussing
with a comb-over

19:24.997 --> 19:26.999
once I resume my killing ways.

19:30.169 --> 19:32.204
Come on. We had a deal.

19:32.239 --> 19:33.740
When she's here.

19:33.772 --> 19:35.942
(sighs)

19:37.777 --> 19:39.412
There's certainly no lack
of supplies.

19:39.445 --> 19:42.013
Only wish I knew which ones
would kill Adam.

19:42.048 --> 19:44.517
According to Riley, his
power source is a uranium core

19:44.550 --> 19:46.152
embedded somewhere
inside his chest,

19:46.184 --> 19:47.819
probably near the spine?

19:47.854 --> 19:50.056
Great. So we just ask him
to lie down quietly

19:50.088 --> 19:52.057
while we do some
exploratory surgery.

19:52.090 --> 19:54.894
What about magic? Some kind of,

19:54.926 --> 19:58.897
I don't know,
uranium-extracting spell?

20:00.967 --> 20:04.103
I know. I'm reaching.

20:04.135 --> 20:05.938
Perhaps a paralyzing spell.

20:05.971 --> 20:09.709
Only I can't perform
the incantation of this.
Right.

20:09.741 --> 20:12.111
Don't you have to speak it
in Sumerian or something?

20:12.144 --> 20:15.548
I do speak Sumerian.
It's not that.

20:15.582 --> 20:19.050
Only a-an experienced witch
can incant it, and you'd have

20:19.085 --> 20:21.788
to be within striking distance
of the subject.

20:21.820 --> 20:22.954
XANDER:
See what you get
for taking French

20:22.989 --> 20:24.523
instead of Sumerian?

20:24.557 --> 20:25.958
What was I thinking?

20:25.991 --> 20:28.295
So no problem. All
we need is Combo Buffy--

20:28.327 --> 20:30.630
her with slayer strength,
Giles' multilingual know-how,

20:30.663 --> 20:33.465
and Willow's witchy power.

20:34.567 --> 20:35.902
Yeah, don't tell me.

20:35.934 --> 20:38.203
I'm just full
of helpful suggestions.

20:38.237 --> 20:39.672
As a matter of fact, you are.

20:42.308 --> 20:44.743
(birds chirping)

20:51.683 --> 20:53.486
Nervous?

20:53.519 --> 20:55.253
No way.

20:55.288 --> 20:59.090
I'm full of that good
old kamikaze spirit.

20:59.125 --> 21:01.093
Xander, just because this
is never gonna work

21:01.126 --> 21:03.061
is no need to
be negative.

21:03.095 --> 21:06.065
WILLOW:
The enjoining spell isn't
powerful enough to defeat Adam?

21:06.097 --> 21:07.433
GILES:
It's very powerful.

21:07.467 --> 21:09.836
It's
also extraordinarily dangerous.

21:09.868 --> 21:13.506
Game faces, guys.
We're going in.

21:20.112 --> 21:21.681
How you doing?

21:21.713 --> 21:25.684
Super. What was I thinking
using stairs all this time?

21:25.718 --> 21:27.720
Okay.

21:29.888 --> 21:32.090
Will...

21:32.124 --> 21:35.193
No, really, Buffy,
it's not as scary as I thought.

21:35.227 --> 21:37.364
No. That's not what
I was gonna say.

21:39.798 --> 21:41.768
I just...

21:41.800 --> 21:44.170
I'm sorry.

21:44.202 --> 21:47.874
I hate that things have been
so strained between all of us.

21:47.906 --> 21:51.943
It's not your fault.
Spike stirred up trouble.

21:51.978 --> 21:55.280
Yeah, but I think
trouble was stir-uppable.

21:55.314 --> 21:58.518
I think we've all sort of
drifted apart this year,

21:58.550 --> 21:59.786
don't you?

21:59.818 --> 22:01.520
Maybe a little.

22:01.554 --> 22:03.789
But, you know,
first year of college,

22:03.823 --> 22:07.727
it's hard to keep the old
high school gang together.

22:07.759 --> 22:11.096
But I want it together.
Will, I miss you.

22:12.598 --> 22:14.567
And Giles and Xander.

22:14.601 --> 22:16.403
And it is my fault.

22:16.435 --> 22:18.471
I've been so wrapped up
in my own stuff,

22:18.505 --> 22:20.306
I've been a bad friend.

22:20.338 --> 22:23.675
You're the slayer, Buffy.
Your stuff is pretty crucial.

22:23.710 --> 22:26.178
I mean Riley and...

22:26.211 --> 22:28.948
Riley, mostly.

22:30.348 --> 22:33.352
I haven't been Miss Available
either.

22:35.186 --> 22:37.557
I-I kept secrets.

22:37.589 --> 22:39.826
I hid things from everyone.

22:39.858 --> 22:41.394
That's not your fault.

22:41.427 --> 22:43.996
Will, you were going
through something huge.

22:44.029 --> 22:48.567
I wanted to tell you,
but I was so scared.

22:48.601 --> 22:51.403
You can tell me anything.

22:51.438 --> 22:53.405
I love you.

22:53.440 --> 22:55.575
You're my best friend.

22:55.607 --> 22:57.343
Me, too.

22:57.375 --> 22:58.677
I love you, too.

22:58.711 --> 23:02.280
Oh.
Falling now.

23:02.314 --> 23:03.715
(grunting)

23:03.750 --> 23:06.919
(panting)
Let's promise
Mmm.

23:06.952 --> 23:08.354
to never not talk again.

23:08.386 --> 23:10.789
I promise, I promise.

23:12.223 --> 23:14.861
Xander.
Oh, wonderful Xander.

23:14.894 --> 23:16.628
You know we
love you, right?

23:16.663 --> 23:18.230
We totally do.

23:18.263 --> 23:20.231
Oh, God.
We're gonna die, aren't we?

23:20.266 --> 23:23.234
No. We just missed you.

23:24.269 --> 23:26.137
Giles, hurry up!

23:27.673 --> 23:29.909
You definitely want
to get down here for this!

23:30.942 --> 23:32.744
(grunting)

23:32.778 --> 23:35.413
Okay, we stick together
and everything should be fine.

23:35.448 --> 23:36.648
Everybody ready?

23:36.682 --> 23:38.651
(grunting)
Let's...

23:42.087 --> 23:43.522
...do this.

23:48.259 --> 23:51.463
SPIKE:
It's must-see TV.

23:53.465 --> 23:56.434
Bait's been taken.
Trap's all set.

23:56.469 --> 23:58.837
Slayer has landed.

23:58.871 --> 24:04.143
So, one chip-erectomy,
please.

24:05.678 --> 24:08.780
Hello. Paging Dr. Owe Me One.

24:08.815 --> 24:10.016
She's not alone.

24:15.354 --> 24:17.624
You failed me again.

24:17.656 --> 24:20.459
Well, that's one way
of looking at it.

24:20.492 --> 24:22.662
What's the other way?

24:24.730 --> 24:26.532
(grunting)

24:26.566 --> 24:28.535
Oh! Come on!

24:28.567 --> 24:30.537
It's not like I wasn't trying.

24:30.569 --> 24:32.538
That's worth something,
isn't it?

24:32.572 --> 24:34.540
I suppose.

24:34.574 --> 24:39.144
Yes, I will honor our agreement
and remove your chip.

24:40.211 --> 24:41.480
Take his head off.

24:41.513 --> 24:43.650
(growls, grunting)

24:48.855 --> 24:50.623
(sizzling)
(groaning)

24:50.656 --> 24:51.857
(shouts)

24:52.490 --> 24:54.192
Let him go.

24:57.496 --> 24:59.330
There's nowhere left to run.

24:59.365 --> 25:01.733
(snarling softly)

25:03.068 --> 25:04.871
Colonel...
Shut up.

25:04.903 --> 25:07.306
You got some
nerve, lady.

25:07.338 --> 25:09.541
You have to listen to us.
You think you
and your friends

25:09.576 --> 25:12.310
can just keep waltzing into
a government installation

25:12.344 --> 25:14.681
brandishing
weapons like...

25:14.713 --> 25:18.017
like...

25:18.049 --> 25:18.951
It's a gourd.

25:20.586 --> 25:23.255
Magic gourd.

25:26.424 --> 25:28.661
What kind of freaks
are you people?

25:28.694 --> 25:31.931
Adam is here, Colonel.
In the Initiative.

25:31.963 --> 25:34.733
Nice try.
Those overcrowded
containment cells of yours--

25:34.767 --> 25:36.903
courtesy of Adam. He's pulling
a Trojan horse on you.

25:36.935 --> 25:38.369
He's just waiting...
Every inch

25:38.403 --> 25:39.672
of this installation

25:39.705 --> 25:42.374
is under
constant 24-hour surveillance.

25:42.407 --> 25:44.210
Including the secret lab?

25:44.242 --> 25:45.477
Including everything!

25:49.949 --> 25:51.917
What secret lab?

25:51.951 --> 25:53.685
The one Adam's been using.

25:53.720 --> 25:56.655
The one built for the final
stage of the 314 Project.

25:58.156 --> 26:01.728
And you have no idea
what I'm talking about.

26:01.760 --> 26:03.695
I know everything
that goes on around here.

26:03.730 --> 26:06.865
A tick on a mouse couldn't
get in without my knowing it.

26:06.898 --> 26:09.268
And if Adam wants to try,
we're ready for him.

26:09.300 --> 26:13.705
Jolly good. H-How exactly do you
plan to get close enough to Adam

26:13.740 --> 26:15.907
to remove his power source?

26:17.943 --> 26:21.480
Hit him simultaneously
with multiple Taser blasters.

26:21.512 --> 26:24.817
Incapacitate him with as much
voltage as we can muster.

26:24.851 --> 26:28.253
Great plan. That's right up
there with "duck and cover."

26:28.287 --> 26:30.757
BUFFY:
I've seen Adam
hit with Taser blasts.

26:30.789 --> 26:32.625
He feeds on it.

26:32.659 --> 26:34.593
And now you're gonna provide him
with an all-you-can-eat buffet?

26:34.626 --> 26:35.961
You telling me my business?

26:35.994 --> 26:37.797
This is not your business.

26:37.829 --> 26:39.298
It's mine.

26:39.330 --> 26:41.267
You, the Initiative,
the boys

26:41.299 --> 26:44.103
at the Pentagon-- you're all in
way over your heads,

26:44.135 --> 26:45.604
messing with primeval forces

26:45.637 --> 26:47.740
you have
absolutely no comprehension of.

26:47.773 --> 26:48.606
And you do?

26:48.641 --> 26:50.342
I'm the slayer.

26:50.375 --> 26:53.112
You're playing on my turf.

26:54.512 --> 26:56.481
Up there, maybe.

26:56.515 --> 26:59.018
But down here,
I'm the one who's in control.

27:00.152 --> 27:01.019
(beep)

27:01.053 --> 27:03.655
Sir, the power grid's down.

27:03.690 --> 27:05.457
Backup's not responding.

27:05.490 --> 27:06.959
(beeping)

27:06.992 --> 27:08.559
We're locked in.

27:13.332 --> 27:14.967
(beeping)

27:16.634 --> 27:19.605
(beep, buzz)

27:19.637 --> 27:21.740
(clicking)

27:27.413 --> 27:30.215
This will be interesting.

27:30.249 --> 27:31.616
(beeping)

27:31.650 --> 27:32.651
(alarm blaring)

27:32.684 --> 27:33.618
What's going on?

27:33.652 --> 27:35.621
MAN:
I don't know.

27:35.653 --> 27:38.023
(snarling, growling)

27:38.057 --> 27:39.525
WOMAN:
Go!

27:41.093 --> 27:44.395
(screaming, shouting)

27:46.999 --> 27:48.634
The containment
area's been breached.

27:48.666 --> 27:50.236
Hostiles are loose.

27:50.269 --> 27:51.837
How many?

27:52.872 --> 27:55.007
All of 'em, sir.

27:55.040 --> 27:58.576
BUFFY:
It's Adam.

27:58.609 --> 28:00.179
Look, I'm the only one
that can stop him now.

28:00.211 --> 28:02.347
Just let me handle this.
Get your people out of here.

28:02.381 --> 28:05.351
All right, you men follow me.
We got to take the armory now.

28:05.384 --> 28:06.853
Yes, sir.
Colonel...
These people

28:06.885 --> 28:08.086
are under arrest.

28:08.119 --> 28:09.387
Do you understand?

28:09.421 --> 28:10.521
MAN:
Yes, sir.

28:19.698 --> 28:22.868
(grunting)

28:22.902 --> 28:24.903
We've got to find Adam.
On it.

28:26.238 --> 28:28.240
GILES:
The enjoining spell

28:28.273 --> 28:31.844
is extremely touchy. It's, uh,
volatile. We-we can't risk it

28:31.877 --> 28:33.578
being interrupted.
We need a place that's

28:33.612 --> 28:36.082
close to you and quiet.
Uh,

28:36.115 --> 28:37.548
quiet?

28:37.583 --> 28:40.586
(shouting, screaming)
(snarling)

28:47.125 --> 28:49.595
(automatic gunfire)

28:55.134 --> 28:57.568
(grunting)

29:15.153 --> 29:17.423
(shouting)
(screeching)

29:20.792 --> 29:22.961
How we doing, Will?
Hold on.

29:22.994 --> 29:25.263
Hold on.

29:25.297 --> 29:27.098
According to this,

29:27.133 --> 29:29.601
there's air ducts
and electrical conduits

29:29.634 --> 29:31.303
all running into there.

29:32.337 --> 29:33.672
So?

29:33.704 --> 29:35.673
So there's no there there.

29:35.707 --> 29:36.942
Look.

29:40.479 --> 29:41.913
It's Adam.

29:41.948 --> 29:42.780
Are you sure?

29:42.815 --> 29:45.151
Right behind 314.

29:47.385 --> 29:48.453
Can you unlock it?

29:48.487 --> 29:50.122
I don't have to.

29:50.155 --> 29:52.959
All the locks in the Initiative
have been disengaged,

29:52.991 --> 29:55.260
except for the exits.

29:55.294 --> 29:57.296
Demon open house.

29:57.328 --> 29:58.596
(distant gunfire)

29:58.630 --> 30:01.633
Great. So we know
we're going to 314.

30:01.666 --> 30:03.634
Now all we have to do
is get there.

30:03.669 --> 30:05.203
(shouting, grunting)

30:12.711 --> 30:15.314
(automatic gunfire)

30:22.020 --> 30:23.689
(grunting)

30:35.401 --> 30:38.037
(growling)

30:43.709 --> 30:46.511
(shouting)

30:46.545 --> 30:49.414
(gunshots)

30:49.448 --> 30:51.849
(shouting, grunting)

30:57.256 --> 30:58.824
(grunts)

30:58.856 --> 31:00.026
Willow, down!
(gunfire)

31:01.093 --> 31:03.394
(grunting)

31:03.429 --> 31:05.530
Come on!

31:09.234 --> 31:10.568
(grunts)

31:16.442 --> 31:18.710
Okay, it should be over here.

31:24.916 --> 31:27.318
(hissing)

31:28.954 --> 31:32.924
Once I'm in, barricade
the door behind me.

31:32.959 --> 31:35.260
Is this place okay
to be Magic Central?

31:35.294 --> 31:37.563
It, uh, should do.

31:37.596 --> 31:39.730
As long as we don't get
blowed up or nothin'.

31:39.765 --> 31:41.567
What are the odds of that?

31:41.599 --> 31:43.970
How long before
the ritual kicks in?

31:44.002 --> 31:46.305
Five minutes, give or take.

31:47.605 --> 31:48.906
I'll move fast then.

31:48.941 --> 31:52.111
Buffy, I still don't
like you going in alone.

31:54.113 --> 31:55.646
I won't be.

32:03.288 --> 32:06.592
(grunting)

32:14.865 --> 32:16.301
Riley.

32:19.837 --> 32:23.174
Are you hurt?

32:24.210 --> 32:25.611
Say something.

32:33.951 --> 32:35.621
What is this?

32:36.654 --> 32:38.624
Why won't you talk to me?

32:38.656 --> 32:40.291
ADAM:
He can't.

32:40.326 --> 32:42.627
He's not programmed to.

32:42.661 --> 32:45.297
He's part
of the final phase now,

32:45.330 --> 32:48.500
as you were supposed to be.
Sorry.

32:48.534 --> 32:50.635
I don't jump through
hoops on command.

32:50.669 --> 32:53.072
I've never really been one
to toe the line.

32:54.140 --> 32:56.474
Oh.

32:57.675 --> 32:58.609
Kill her.

32:58.644 --> 32:59.677
(grunting)

32:59.711 --> 33:00.979
I thought you'd never ask.

33:05.084 --> 33:06.884
(buzzing)

33:13.259 --> 33:16.095
(grunting)
(buzzing)

33:24.670 --> 33:27.173
WILLOW:
The power of the slayer
and all who wield it.

33:27.205 --> 33:30.541
Last to ancient first,
we invoke thee.

33:30.576 --> 33:33.211
Grant us thy domain
and primal strength.

33:33.244 --> 33:35.980
Accept us
and the powers we possess.

33:36.013 --> 33:38.049
Make us mind and heart
and spirit joined.

33:38.084 --> 33:41.319
Let the hand encompass us.
Do thy will.

33:41.353 --> 33:43.454
(grunting)

33:52.064 --> 33:53.098
Buffy!

33:53.898 --> 33:56.034
Shut up.

33:56.067 --> 33:59.971
Watch me kill your girlfriend,
Finn. That's an order.

34:01.373 --> 34:03.842
(exhales)

34:03.875 --> 34:06.044
(blows landing,
grunting)

34:12.217 --> 34:14.018
(shattering)

34:14.052 --> 34:16.487
(blows landing,
grunting)

34:21.393 --> 34:24.096
(grunting)

34:30.768 --> 34:33.605
Spiritus... spirit.

34:35.907 --> 34:39.077
Animus... heart.

34:40.077 --> 34:42.914
Sophus... mind.

34:44.081 --> 34:46.152
And manus...

34:46.184 --> 34:48.320
the hand.

34:51.822 --> 34:54.159
(grunting)

34:56.827 --> 34:59.297
(groans)

34:59.331 --> 35:01.233
(grunts)

35:01.266 --> 35:02.900
(grunts)

35:02.934 --> 35:06.405
We enjoin that we may inhabit
the vessel--

35:06.438 --> 35:08.907
the hand, daughter of Sineya,

35:08.940 --> 35:10.876
first of the ones.

35:12.110 --> 35:13.478
(blows landing)

35:13.512 --> 35:15.181
(groans)

35:15.213 --> 35:19.184
(grunting)

35:23.489 --> 35:25.891
(grunting)

35:29.494 --> 35:32.197
Is that it?
That all you got?

35:32.231 --> 35:34.632
RILEY:
No! She's got me.

35:34.666 --> 35:37.536
(grunting)

35:37.568 --> 35:39.804
Look who's come off the bench.

35:41.039 --> 35:43.509
(grunting)

35:43.541 --> 35:45.976
I need to get to Adam,
like, now. Are you able?

35:46.010 --> 35:48.380
Go.

35:51.016 --> 35:53.284
(growling)

35:53.318 --> 35:56.387
(grunting)

36:00.659 --> 36:03.394
(gunfire)
(shouting)

36:13.704 --> 36:16.708
Fall back! Fall back!

36:16.742 --> 36:20.311
Protect the flank, troops!
Lock down that pit!

36:20.346 --> 36:22.047
(gunfire)

36:24.583 --> 36:26.918
Fun, isn't it?

36:28.387 --> 36:31.056
I do appreciate
violence.

36:31.088 --> 36:32.590
Good.

36:33.559 --> 36:35.760
(grunting)

36:49.574 --> 36:52.344
(grunting)

36:52.378 --> 36:53.278
Broke your arm.

36:53.311 --> 36:55.280
Got another.

36:55.313 --> 36:57.181
(whirring)

36:57.215 --> 36:59.585
(clanking)

37:00.619 --> 37:02.820
I've been upgrading.

37:03.755 --> 37:05.791
(gunfire)

37:17.603 --> 37:19.971
We implore thee, admit us.

37:20.005 --> 37:21.739
Bring us to the vessel.

37:21.773 --> 37:23.775
Take us now.

37:40.826 --> 37:43.594
You can't last much longer.

37:43.628 --> 37:44.996
BUFFY/WILLOW/XANDER/GILES:
We can.

37:45.030 --> 37:46.998
We are forever.

37:48.967 --> 37:51.336
(speaking Sumerian)

37:58.275 --> 37:59.911
Interesting.

37:59.945 --> 38:01.947
(gunfire)
(speaking Sumerian)

38:04.516 --> 38:07.117
Very... interesting.

38:08.686 --> 38:10.456
(gunshots in distance)

38:10.489 --> 38:13.224
(grunting)

38:17.195 --> 38:19.130
What are you making me do this
for?

38:20.465 --> 38:22.934
Not that I'm not enjoying
myself.

38:22.967 --> 38:24.869
(clanging)

38:27.072 --> 38:28.773
But Adam's
not gonna like it if...

38:28.806 --> 38:30.708
(grunting)

38:37.315 --> 38:39.284
(growls)

38:39.317 --> 38:42.653
(grunting)

38:55.233 --> 38:56.402
(gunfire)

38:56.434 --> 38:59.336
(whirring)

39:02.407 --> 39:05.411
(wings flapping)

39:08.713 --> 39:11.215
(clanking)

39:16.521 --> 39:18.590
(grunting)

39:25.030 --> 39:27.065
How... can you...

39:27.097 --> 39:30.335
You could never hope to grasp
the source of our power.

39:30.367 --> 39:31.536
(grunts)

39:35.239 --> 39:37.375
(grunting)

39:39.911 --> 39:42.079
(squishing)

39:47.885 --> 39:50.021
(grunts)

39:50.054 --> 39:52.056
But yours is right here.

39:52.090 --> 39:53.458
(panting)

39:53.492 --> 39:56.393
(thud)

40:02.233 --> 40:03.168
Buffy.

40:08.106 --> 40:11.909
(voices chanting in Sumerian)

40:25.990 --> 40:27.224
(grunts)

40:27.257 --> 40:29.594
(panting)

40:34.500 --> 40:36.735
Wow. That was...

40:36.768 --> 40:38.670
(crashing)

40:38.704 --> 40:41.405
(snarling)
(grunting)

40:41.438 --> 40:43.108
(snap)

40:43.141 --> 40:48.313
(Spike panting,
chuckles)

40:48.346 --> 40:49.514
Nasty sort of fellow.

40:49.547 --> 40:52.282
Lucky for you blighters
I was here, eh?

40:52.317 --> 40:54.885
Yes. Uh, thank you.

40:56.454 --> 40:58.322
Although your heroism
is slightly muted by the fact

40:58.356 --> 41:00.324
that you were helping Adam
to start a war

41:00.358 --> 41:02.059
that would kill us all.

41:03.894 --> 41:06.164
You probably just saved us
so we wouldn't stake you

41:06.197 --> 41:07.431
right here.

41:07.465 --> 41:09.134
Well, yeah.

41:09.166 --> 41:11.536
Did it work?

41:18.744 --> 41:20.711
Well, then everything's
all right,

41:20.746 --> 41:23.014
and we all get to be not staked
through the heart.

41:23.047 --> 41:24.449
Good work, team.

41:24.481 --> 41:26.985
(hissing)

41:27.018 --> 41:28.987
Buffy.

41:29.019 --> 41:31.121
Wasn't it amazing?
You were great.

41:31.155 --> 41:33.692
We were great.
We still got men
out there.

41:33.724 --> 41:36.561
Well, let's go
save 'em, by gum.

41:36.594 --> 41:38.295
You guys get to the
exits, get 'em open. You,

41:38.329 --> 41:40.931
organize the soldiers,
pull 'em back. I'll take point.

41:43.333 --> 41:45.003
WILLOW:
Are you up to this?
I am.

41:45.771 --> 41:47.706
It was an experiment.

41:47.739 --> 41:50.507
The Initiative represented
the government's interest

41:50.541 --> 41:53.844
in not only controlling
the otherworldly menace

41:53.878 --> 41:58.849
but in harnessing its power
for our own military purposes.

41:58.884 --> 42:01.753
The considered opinion
of this council

42:01.786 --> 42:05.356
is that the experiment
has failed.

42:05.389 --> 42:07.659
*

42:07.693 --> 42:10.494
Once the prototype took control
 of the complex,

42:10.527 --> 42:14.398
our soldiers suffered
 a 40% casualty rate.

42:14.431 --> 42:16.902
And it seems that it was
 only through the actions

42:16.934 --> 42:20.237
of a deserter and a group
 of civilian insurrectionists

42:20.271 --> 42:24.175
that our losses were not total.

42:24.208 --> 42:28.579
I trust the irony of that
 is not lost on any of us.

42:28.614 --> 42:31.516
Maggie Walsh's vision
 was brilliant

42:31.548 --> 42:34.920
but ultimately insupportable.

42:34.952 --> 42:37.688
The demons cannot be harnessed,

42:37.722 --> 42:40.692
cannot be controlled.

42:40.726 --> 42:42.693
It is therefore
our recommendation

42:42.728 --> 42:44.528
that this project be terminated

42:44.561 --> 42:47.264
and all records
concerning it expunged.

42:47.297 --> 42:49.534
Our soldiers will be debriefed.

42:49.567 --> 42:52.269
Standard confidentiality clause.

42:52.302 --> 42:55.039
We will monitor the civilians,

42:55.072 --> 42:59.543
any usual measures prepared
should they try to go public.

42:59.577 --> 43:02.648
I don't think they will.

43:02.681 --> 43:07.085
The Initiative itself
will be filled in with concrete.

43:07.117 --> 43:09.721
Burn it down, gentlemen.

43:09.755 --> 43:11.489
Burn it down

43:11.521 --> 43:14.092
and salt the earth.

43:16.594 --> 43:18.496
(static)

43:54.965 --> 43:57.402
Grr. Argh.
