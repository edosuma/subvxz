00:06.008 --> 00:09.359
There's this thing. It's really creepy.

00:09.360 --> 00:12.462
Sometimes I feel like I'm being watched.

00:12.463 --> 00:15.766
I see this big, black, massive shadow.

00:15.767 --> 00:18.222
There's a girl right there.

00:18.223 --> 00:20.518
She's got blood all over her dress.

00:20.519 --> 00:21.953
It's very gruesome.

00:21.954 --> 00:24.656
She likes to play games.

00:24.657 --> 00:27.125
The foundation of the house shook.

00:27.126 --> 00:29.027
All the energy just went fwoop!

00:29.028 --> 00:32.109
I'm being kicked out of my own home.

00:32.110 --> 00:34.870
This isn't good.

00:37.270 --> 00:39.475
They're being watched.

00:39.476 --> 00:42.383
My name is Amy Allan.

00:42.384 --> 00:44.634
This thing likes death.

00:44.635 --> 00:46.417
I see dead people.

00:46.418 --> 00:47.985
This thing is, like, a monster.

00:47.986 --> 00:50.055
I speak to dead people.

00:50.056 --> 00:51.745
And he's pissed off now.

00:51.746 --> 00:53.254
And they speak to me.

00:53.255 --> 00:54.850
His head was cracked.

00:54.851 --> 00:57.830
But there's only one way to
know if my findings are real.

00:57.831 --> 00:59.880
This guy was murdered.

00:59.881 --> 01:01.299
I rely on my partner.

01:01.300 --> 01:02.703
I'm Steve Di Schiavi.

01:02.704 --> 01:04.654
I'm a retired New York
City homicide Detective.

01:04.655 --> 01:07.372
I cannot help you unless
I know the whole story.

01:07.373 --> 01:10.465
And I know every person,
every house has secrets.

01:10.466 --> 01:13.378
You saw her? It's my job to reveal them.

01:13.379 --> 01:14.531
Why would you stay here?

01:14.532 --> 01:16.655
But Steve and I never speak...

01:16.656 --> 01:18.639
We never communicate
during an investigation.

01:18.640 --> 01:20.051
Until the very end.

01:20.052 --> 01:21.825
Stop it.

01:21.826 --> 01:23.989
We uncover if it's safe for you to stay...

01:23.990 --> 01:26.395
I want to know the truth. I
want to know what's happening.

01:26.396 --> 01:27.776
Or time to get out.

01:27.777 --> 01:32.457
I told you there were ghosts in this house.

01:34.000 --> 01:40.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:53.371 --> 01:55.839
Amy and I conduct our
investigations separately.

01:55.840 --> 02:01.039
It's my job to look into the property's
past and hear from the witnesses involved.

02:01.040 --> 02:04.520
While Amy makes contact with the dead.

02:04.521 --> 02:06.416
When our investigation is done,

02:06.417 --> 02:11.517
we meet with our clients
and reveal our findings.

02:15.193 --> 02:18.168
I'm in Forester, Michigan, a
small waterfront community

02:18.169 --> 02:20.679
about an hour and a half from Detroit.

02:20.680 --> 02:22.899
I'm getting ready to meet
with a woman named Chrystal,

02:22.900 --> 02:26.536
who says the house she inherited from
her parents is not only scaring her...

02:26.537 --> 02:30.051
It's tearing her entire family apart.

02:30.052 --> 02:35.952
I hope we can figure out what the
hell's going on in this place.

02:46.391 --> 02:49.926
It's obvious from the photos that a
family with at least one kid lives here.

02:49.927 --> 02:52.896
And that could influence Amy's findings.

02:52.897 --> 02:58.797
So it's important that I remove them
all before she can begin her walk.

03:25.515 --> 03:31.215
There's this guy, and all of
a sudden, like, I was him.

03:33.010 --> 03:38.910
That's never happened before in an
opening, where I was the dead person.

03:39.263 --> 03:42.083
Or he was in me.

03:42.191 --> 03:46.383
Before I begin my walk, I enter a
meditative state called opening.

03:46.384 --> 03:49.686
This allows me to receive
information from the dead.

03:49.687 --> 03:55.587
I felt very uncomfortable because
I felt like I was losing myself.

03:58.696 --> 04:00.979
I don't do that.

04:00.980 --> 04:05.000
I don't let them do that anymore.

04:05.312 --> 04:09.839
So, I was pushing him out, but
I couldn't, so I stopped.

04:09.840 --> 04:11.341
Stopped the opening, you mean?

04:11.342 --> 04:13.808
Yes, I stopped the opening.

04:13.809 --> 04:17.228
He was a big, burly dude.

04:17.781 --> 04:22.526
His hands were calloused...
very, very calloused.

04:22.527 --> 04:26.727
I'm getting a sharp pain right here.

04:29.450 --> 04:34.586
Anyways, he didn't come back
until I was in the yard.

04:34.587 --> 04:35.945
Ah!

04:35.946 --> 04:37.866
Uh...

04:38.839 --> 04:40.069
Uh...

04:40.070 --> 04:44.390
Getting a really sharp pain right here.

05:01.924 --> 05:04.220
So, Chrystal, when we spoke
on the phone it sounded like,

05:04.221 --> 05:07.197
things are pretty serious
here, what's going on?

05:07.198 --> 05:10.461
We have been experiencing...

05:10.462 --> 05:13.603
Noises, voices, footsteps.

05:13.604 --> 05:15.038
Objects have moved.

05:15.039 --> 05:16.806
Lights going on and off.

05:16.807 --> 05:19.876
My family has seen shadows.

05:19.877 --> 05:23.180
I get very overwhelmed and
emotional, something comes over me.

05:23.181 --> 05:24.851
Like, you feel a presence.

05:24.852 --> 05:27.358
Is it getting to the point where
you think it's dangerous here?

05:27.359 --> 05:29.425
I feel like it's getting that way.

05:29.426 --> 05:33.099
I feel like it's
progressively getting worse.

05:33.100 --> 05:34.896
So, how long have you been living here?

05:34.897 --> 05:36.142
About a year.

05:36.143 --> 05:38.428
I inherited it from my parents.

05:38.429 --> 05:41.537
They were making the house into
a bed-and-breakfast and...

05:41.538 --> 05:44.382
That's kind of why I sold
my home and moved in here,

05:44.383 --> 05:47.194
with my husband and my
three children, because I

05:47.195 --> 05:51.850
want to honor my mom by finishing the
home and making it a bed-and-breakfast.

05:51.851 --> 05:54.494
- Okay, so that's your plans for the house.
- Right.

05:54.495 --> 05:56.989
Chrystal, why is it so
important for you to stay?

05:56.990 --> 05:59.763
Um, I'm attached to this home.

05:59.764 --> 06:02.361
My whole family's attached.

06:02.362 --> 06:05.561
So, obviously, it's emotional for you.

06:05.562 --> 06:08.466
It's very emotional. I feel
like I'm being kicked out.

06:08.467 --> 06:11.595
Kicked out of my own home.

06:11.596 --> 06:13.961
Well, hopefully we'll get
some answers for you,

06:13.962 --> 06:16.266
and you won't have to leave, okay?

06:16.267 --> 06:18.187
Okay.

06:20.377 --> 06:22.897
He is ticked.

06:23.741 --> 06:27.277
He's pissed off, and he won't talk to me
because I won't let him inside my body.

06:27.278 --> 06:29.198
Okay.

06:29.880 --> 06:31.814
So, do you know who he is?

06:31.815 --> 06:35.684
I think he's the guy who lived here.

06:35.685 --> 06:37.954
I mean, he, like, owned the
property or something...

06:37.955 --> 06:40.757
The guy from my opening.

06:40.758 --> 06:43.338
Where are you?

06:44.161 --> 06:48.390
It took me years to learn how to
keep the dead from entering my body.

06:48.391 --> 06:50.552
But this man has figured out a way in.

06:50.553 --> 06:55.413
And now that I kicked
him out, he's furious.

06:56.974 --> 06:58.775
Oh, God.

06:58.776 --> 07:00.543
Oh, my head. My head hurts.

07:00.544 --> 07:02.079
This is really weird.

07:02.080 --> 07:07.980
It's almost like if somebody took
your jaw and just ripped it off.

07:11.922 --> 07:14.082
Oh, God.

07:15.660 --> 07:20.319
This is the area of the house where
most of the activity occurs.

07:20.320 --> 07:21.755
Okay. Like what?

07:21.756 --> 07:24.768
Lights coming on constantly.

07:24.769 --> 07:28.405
I literally saw the
bathroom light switch on.

07:28.406 --> 07:30.206
And nobody was in the bathroom, I assume?

07:30.207 --> 07:34.010
No, I got up and checked it out and
said, "anyone in the bathroom?"

07:34.011 --> 07:35.178
And there was nobody there.

07:35.179 --> 07:37.180
Okay, so you saw the light go on?

07:37.181 --> 07:39.549
Something manually flips that switch.

07:39.550 --> 07:42.552
Okay. That's strange.

07:42.553 --> 07:44.854
What do you know about the
house or the area itself?

07:44.855 --> 07:46.189
Do you have any history here?

07:46.190 --> 07:50.026
The first documentation
that I see is from 1892.

07:50.027 --> 07:52.061
Okay. So this house is old.

07:52.062 --> 07:54.230
Any deaths in the area?

07:54.231 --> 07:57.549
I do know that there is a town legend

07:57.550 --> 08:00.218
that people have talked
about since I was a kid.

08:00.219 --> 08:01.284
What is it?

08:01.285 --> 08:06.108
Her name is Minnie Quay, and in the
late 1800s, she committed suicide.

08:06.109 --> 08:12.009
She's actually buried in the local cemetery
that's just not too far from here.

08:18.609 --> 08:22.449
So, there's a girl right there.

08:24.729 --> 08:30.122
She's wearing, like, a yellow
dress, and she has long hair.

08:30.123 --> 08:32.883
She's not happy.

08:36.374 --> 08:39.283
She's really wild, especially
for her time, you know?

08:39.284 --> 08:43.311
And I think she got in trouble a lot.

08:43.312 --> 08:44.631
She...

08:44.632 --> 08:47.092
Is an issue.

08:47.407 --> 08:50.107
She's an issue.

08:51.987 --> 08:53.907
Yeah.

08:56.560 --> 08:59.629
She's so hyper, I can't understand
a word she's [Bleep] saying.

08:59.630 --> 09:01.561
She's like, "alalala," like right here.

09:01.562 --> 09:03.332
Lalalalalala, pa-pa-pa...

09:03.333 --> 09:05.167
Talking so fast, I can't understand her.

09:05.168 --> 09:07.927
I'm, like, asking her to calm down.

09:07.928 --> 09:11.602
She needs to calm it down, calm it down.

09:11.603 --> 09:14.123
Calm it down.

09:20.518 --> 09:25.498
We've had a few experiences upstairs
that were pretty frightening.

09:25.499 --> 09:27.813
My husband and I were in bed one night,

09:27.814 --> 09:30.360
and we heard footsteps
coming up the stairs.

09:30.361 --> 09:33.178
And I got up out of bed, and I
looked at the top of the stairs,

09:33.179 --> 09:36.520
expecting, really, to see
somebody on the stairway...

09:36.521 --> 09:39.038
And nobody was there.

09:39.039 --> 09:40.557
As we were walking down the steps,

09:40.558 --> 09:43.840
we realized at that point
that we were following it.

09:43.841 --> 09:45.386
Now, the kids were downstairs?

09:45.387 --> 09:47.034
Yes, they were sleeping in their beds.

09:47.035 --> 09:50.513
Okay, so, besides the footsteps, have
you experienced anything else up here?

09:50.514 --> 09:53.215
Yeah. One day, I walked into the
house through the back door,

09:53.216 --> 09:57.176
and I heard a door slam upstairs.

09:59.323 --> 10:03.059
It slammed so hard that literally
the foundation of the house shook.

10:03.060 --> 10:05.528
Wow. Now, was anybody upstairs?

10:05.529 --> 10:07.495
- No.
- All right.

10:07.496 --> 10:10.615
Well, Chrystal, I don't know what
Amy's gonna see on her walk.

10:10.616 --> 10:12.118
She could turn around and tell you...

10:12.119 --> 10:14.737
"Listen, you can't stay here,
you got to get out of here".

10:14.738 --> 10:16.962
You got to be prepared for that.

10:16.963 --> 10:20.790
It's my mother's dream to make
this place a bed-and-breakfast,

10:20.791 --> 10:24.991
and I want to continue on with that.

10:28.752 --> 10:32.052
She likes to play games.

10:32.531 --> 10:34.691
Oh, kay.

10:36.398 --> 10:39.853
In my opening, I saw this
hallway, and all the doors were,

10:39.854 --> 10:44.054
opening and closing at the same time.

10:44.902 --> 10:47.656
This has to do with the girl.

10:47.657 --> 10:50.881
Do you know, like, why she does that?

10:50.882 --> 10:54.100
She likes to mess around.

10:54.101 --> 10:56.151
She's [Bleep] nuts.

10:56.152 --> 10:59.332
She's totally lost it.

11:23.750 --> 11:26.755
So, Brittany, I was talking to your mom,
and she was explaining what's going

11:26.756 --> 11:30.094
on in the house and how it's affecting
her and practically the whole family.

11:30.095 --> 11:32.044
So what about yourself?

11:32.045 --> 11:36.156
I just wake up in the middle of the night
sometimes, I feel like I'm being watched.

11:36.157 --> 11:38.482
I get an eerie feeling.

11:38.483 --> 11:41.668
So, what do you think is watching you?

11:41.669 --> 11:45.886
I have seen a tall, black shadowy person.

11:45.887 --> 11:47.574
- Okay.
- And I never see its face.

11:47.575 --> 11:51.235
It's just like a black blob.

11:55.964 --> 11:59.411
I feel bad in this room. I don't like it.

11:59.412 --> 12:01.635
I feel dark.

12:01.636 --> 12:05.776
Like, corners are really, really bad.

12:09.343 --> 12:13.198
So, there's two of these very tall, dark...

12:13.199 --> 12:16.799
Solid, perfectly round things.

12:20.344 --> 12:24.024
Do you know if they can
interact with anybody living?

12:24.025 --> 12:27.145
I feel like they can.

12:29.864 --> 12:32.465
And they can reach.

12:32.466 --> 12:36.306
They're trying to get something.

12:46.480 --> 12:49.751
So, Brittany, why did you bring me
in the kitchen? What's going on?

12:49.752 --> 12:54.035
I was standing right here, and I
actually saw the shadowy figure,

12:54.036 --> 12:57.524
standing right there in the doorway.

12:57.525 --> 13:02.342
Almost like it was watching us and
listening to our conversation.

13:02.343 --> 13:07.729
It was really tall, skinnier,
but it resembles like a man.

13:07.730 --> 13:09.188
Is it something you can see through?

13:09.189 --> 13:12.969
No. It's a black, dark shadow.

13:20.210 --> 13:23.071
I'm getting two things.

13:23.072 --> 13:24.953
They're together.

13:24.954 --> 13:29.806
- What do you mean?
- They have some relationship here.

13:29.807 --> 13:32.541
And it's a male and a female.

13:32.542 --> 13:36.142
This is male. That's female.

13:36.218 --> 13:39.698
That's angry. This is sad.

13:41.364 --> 13:43.232
I think these black masses
are the beginnings,

13:43.233 --> 13:45.365
of a psychokinetic manifestation.

13:45.366 --> 13:46.889
I can't tell where they came from,

13:46.890 --> 13:49.808
but they're powerful and can
affect people in this house.

13:49.809 --> 13:52.277
Especially whoever sleeps in that room.

13:52.278 --> 13:55.814
This one makes you hurt inside.

13:55.815 --> 13:56.909
Like how?

13:56.910 --> 14:01.350
Like lots of nervous energy here, like...

14:03.550 --> 14:07.592
Or your heart's beating, and your head's
dizzy, and you're kind of nauseous,

14:07.593 --> 14:12.153
and you feel like you're gonna fall over.

14:12.765 --> 14:15.656
I'm physically being affected here.

14:15.657 --> 14:21.417
I got chills just on my leg,
like there's something here.

14:24.643 --> 14:27.403
This isn't good.

14:35.254 --> 14:37.503
So, Mike, I was talking to
your wife, Chrystal, and

14:37.504 --> 14:39.803
she's pretty upset about the
stuff that's happening here.

14:39.804 --> 14:42.987
Now, is there any place specific in the
house where you've experienced anything?

14:42.988 --> 14:48.088
I have actually seen a
shadow in my dining room.

14:48.481 --> 14:51.439
I was standing in the
doorway of my kitchen.

14:51.440 --> 14:55.036
All of a sudden, I see this
big, black, massive shadow.

14:55.037 --> 14:57.701
Just go right across my dining-room wall.

14:57.702 --> 14:59.842
And it freaked me out a little bit.

14:59.843 --> 15:01.184
Well, describe it to me.

15:01.185 --> 15:03.936
So, it was like... about this wide.

15:03.937 --> 15:05.501
It was like a mass.

15:05.502 --> 15:08.653
It took up the whole length of the
ceiling, which we've got 9-foot ceilings,

15:08.654 --> 15:12.374
so I know it was pretty tall.

15:14.020 --> 15:17.138
Wow. I don't know what this is.

15:17.139 --> 15:20.892
Like, all of a sudden, all of
the energy just went fwoop!

15:20.893 --> 15:24.313
And it's completely still.

15:29.611 --> 15:32.371
Nobody's talking.

15:37.759 --> 15:40.695
Getting chills up my back right here.

15:40.696 --> 15:43.996
It's like being touched.

15:44.300 --> 15:47.235
It's really tall, and it bends over.

15:47.236 --> 15:50.176
It's really creepy.

15:53.631 --> 15:56.508
It's like 9 feet tall.

15:56.509 --> 16:00.049
And it has to bend to see.

16:02.517 --> 16:04.465
I don't feel good in here.

16:04.466 --> 16:08.006
I feel really sick in here.

16:08.056 --> 16:10.163
I don't like it.

16:10.164 --> 16:14.047
That's it. That's it. That's it.

16:14.048 --> 16:16.508
This is bad.

16:29.889 --> 16:31.467
I'm gonna start my investigation

16:31.468 --> 16:35.233
by following up on something
Chrystal told me about...

16:35.234 --> 16:39.816
The mysterious death of a
teenage girl named Minnie Quay.

16:39.817 --> 16:41.650
I'm heading over to meet
with a local author,

16:41.651 --> 16:43.812
who's been researching this case for years.

16:43.813 --> 16:49.393
I'm hoping she's got some
information to help my case.

16:56.759 --> 16:59.438
Denise, the reason I called
you is my client mentioned,

16:59.439 --> 17:01.895
a legend about this girl, Minnie
Quay, that killed herself.

17:01.896 --> 17:03.812
I need to find out from
you if it's true or not.

17:03.813 --> 17:04.935
Oh, it's true.

17:04.936 --> 17:07.724
- It is?
- Minnie Quay did kill herself.

17:07.726 --> 17:09.117
Now, when did this happen?

17:09.118 --> 17:12.520
This happened on April 27th, 1876.

17:12.521 --> 17:13.561
Okay.

17:13.563 --> 17:17.223
Here is her death certificate.

17:18.223 --> 17:21.164
Suicide by drowning.

17:21.765 --> 17:23.185
So, what can you tell me about her?

17:23.185 --> 17:26.800
You know, Minnie was a 15-year-old
girl who was boy-crazy.

17:26.800 --> 17:29.136
She was a wild child of the time.

17:29.137 --> 17:31.754
But her parents were very strict.

17:31.755 --> 17:36.188
And so she was unable to do the
things that she wanted to do.

17:36.189 --> 17:39.646
She fell in love with a sailor
off one of these ships,

17:39.647 --> 17:42.715
and she would secretly meet him.

17:42.716 --> 17:44.975
Uh, they pledged their love to each other.

17:44.976 --> 17:47.669
Maybe they were formally engaged.

17:47.670 --> 17:50.381
And her parents found out.

17:50.382 --> 17:53.961
And they forbade her to see this sailor.

17:53.962 --> 17:59.862
And she defied them and tried to see
him, and they locked her in her room.

18:07.376 --> 18:10.722
I'm getting a really weird pain.

18:10.723 --> 18:13.098
This is from someone else.

18:13.099 --> 18:15.319
Mm, damn.

18:15.661 --> 18:17.521
Wow.

18:19.622 --> 18:22.790
Pain behind my ears, on either side...

18:22.791 --> 18:25.216
Really, really intense.

18:25.217 --> 18:28.517
The girl who slams doors upstairs
is trying to get my attention.

18:28.518 --> 18:31.022
She finally has someone who can hear her.

18:31.023 --> 18:34.298
And desperately wants to tell me her story.

18:34.299 --> 18:37.805
She said her father was a bastard and um...

18:37.806 --> 18:41.826
I think she got in trouble a lot.

18:42.011 --> 18:45.380
You know, she was kind of like the black
sheep of the family or something.

18:45.381 --> 18:48.630
She got married. She's
really, really young.

18:48.631 --> 18:51.157
She didn't want anything
to do with anybody.

18:51.158 --> 18:53.468
She hated her father.

18:53.469 --> 18:57.729
I don't think he cared for her much.

18:59.770 --> 19:04.270
And then I'm getting a pain on my head.

19:05.087 --> 19:10.967
I'm feeling, like, this pain
in my head that's like crazy.

19:11.384 --> 19:14.588
So, what exactly happened after
her parents let her out?

19:14.589 --> 19:17.624
When the shipping season
reopened again in April,

19:17.625 --> 19:22.506
she found out that his ship had
foundered, and he was lost at sea.

19:22.507 --> 19:24.130
She was devastated.

19:24.131 --> 19:30.031
And so, on April 27th, eyewitnesses said
that she walked through Main Street.

19:30.805 --> 19:35.315
- Okay.
- And walked down the length of the pier...

19:35.316 --> 19:40.656
And jumped into the frigid,
icy water of Lake Huron.

19:44.451 --> 19:46.929
Now, are we talking about
the pier a few hundred

19:46.930 --> 19:49.907
- yards from the house I'm investigating?
- Correct.

19:49.908 --> 19:53.494
The water was probably only 38
to 40 degrees at that time.

19:53.495 --> 19:54.695
She wouldn't have lasted long.

19:54.696 --> 19:56.713
She would not have lasted long.

19:56.714 --> 19:58.632
It's painful to jump in icy water.

19:58.633 --> 20:02.236
She would have gasped,
maybe inhaled water...

20:02.237 --> 20:04.940
And once the core temperature
begins to drop...

20:04.941 --> 20:07.241
- Right.
- The systems begin to fail.

20:07.242 --> 20:09.550
Okay. So, was her body recovered?

20:09.551 --> 20:12.579
It was recovered. They did
it by using grappling hooks.

20:12.580 --> 20:14.648
Oh, I've seen that before.

20:14.649 --> 20:15.849
It's very gruesome.

20:15.850 --> 20:19.713
They could hook into the
neck, the torso, the face.

20:19.714 --> 20:22.103
I actually seen a guy one time
get caught under the chin,

20:22.104 --> 20:25.123
and that's how they were able to pull
him out of the water. It's pretty sad.

20:25.124 --> 20:27.464
It is sad.

20:29.891 --> 20:33.522
I'm just hearing this woman.
There's a woman crying.

20:33.523 --> 20:36.403
It's just a girl.

20:36.661 --> 20:39.541
It's just a girl.

20:41.208 --> 20:44.123
I'm walking away from the
house and across the street.

20:44.124 --> 20:47.047
Right away I can see something
traumatic happened here.

20:47.048 --> 20:51.662
And I'm seeing the residual
energy play out in front of me.

20:51.663 --> 20:57.563
The girl who's sad is lost, and
then a woman's looking for her.

21:00.862 --> 21:03.097
Yelling, yelling, yelling for her.

21:03.098 --> 21:06.578
Lots of people are yelling.

21:07.853 --> 21:10.155
I can't uh...

21:10.156 --> 21:12.633
I can't uh...

21:12.634 --> 21:13.495
Reach it.

21:13.496 --> 21:16.136
I can't, uh...

21:16.546 --> 21:18.646
Breathe.

21:19.347 --> 21:22.407
I think she's dying.

21:37.925 --> 21:41.895
Since this is such a small town and
everything's so close together.

21:41.896 --> 21:46.866
Minnie Quay's suicide might not have been
the only death near Chrystal's property.

21:46.867 --> 21:49.068
So I'm heading over to meet
with a local historian

21:49.069 --> 21:54.969
who tells me Forester has a very
colorful and tragic history.

22:00.414 --> 22:03.417
T.J., you mentioned that
Forester had a dark past.

22:03.418 --> 22:04.650
Yeah.

22:04.651 --> 22:09.155
In 1871, you get a massive fire that
starts over on the West Side of the state,

22:09.156 --> 22:10.824
and it never really ends.

22:10.825 --> 22:14.027
It just keeps kind of hopscotching
its way across the state.

22:14.028 --> 22:16.129
Hundreds upon hundreds of people die.

22:16.130 --> 22:19.792
In Forester, there are stories of
people jumping into their wells,

22:19.793 --> 22:21.889
people that literally, you
know, walked into the

22:21.890 --> 22:23.797
lake because there was no place else to go.

22:23.798 --> 22:25.171
It was just a ball of flame.

22:25.172 --> 22:27.131
How bad was the fire? What got destroyed?

22:27.132 --> 22:29.943
The '71 fire pretty much
devastated the entire community.

22:29.944 --> 22:31.654
Did they rebuild?

22:31.655 --> 22:34.780
They did, but the fire of '81

22:34.781 --> 22:37.270
kind of spelled the doom
a second time around.

22:37.271 --> 22:39.812
While it didn't devastate it
as much as it did in '71,

22:39.813 --> 22:42.736
it still damaged the town pretty badly.

22:42.737 --> 22:45.621
Oh, geez. Look at this. Wow.

22:45.622 --> 22:47.190
So, what happened to these people?

22:47.191 --> 22:51.594
A lot of them just left, and
Forester never truly recovered.

22:51.595 --> 22:53.169
Well, a lot of tragedy.

22:53.170 --> 22:55.426
You weren't kidding when you
said it had a dark past.

22:55.427 --> 22:57.347
Yeah.

23:07.544 --> 23:10.580
Something happened, and
everybody went away.

23:10.581 --> 23:14.852
But this was not attached to the house.

23:14.853 --> 23:17.553
This is outside.

23:19.777 --> 23:24.157
I just see people yelling and screaming.

23:24.410 --> 23:30.310
Like, I see this one woman, and she's
laying there, and she's in blood.

23:30.587 --> 23:34.967
And I do see a little boy who's dead.

23:35.493 --> 23:39.093
Probably like 15 to 20 died.

23:46.816 --> 23:52.716
The two fires that swept through Forester
in the late 1800s were a definite tragedy.

23:52.847 --> 23:57.952
So I'm at the library to find out who
owned Chrystal's land around that time.

23:57.953 --> 24:00.008
While looking through the
town's property records,

24:00.009 --> 24:03.490
I came across the name Harrison Cooper.

24:03.491 --> 24:05.692
He not only owned the land back then

24:05.693 --> 24:10.286
but had some strange debts
associated with his name.

24:10.287 --> 24:13.514
I need to find out more
about the Cooper family.

24:13.515 --> 24:16.003
I'm on my way to meet
with a local genealogist.

24:16.004 --> 24:21.904
Who promised to tell me a lot more
about this family's dark past.

24:28.250 --> 24:30.684
I came across the name Harrison Cooper.

24:30.685 --> 24:33.294
And I know he lived in the
property I'm investigating.

24:33.295 --> 24:34.600
What can you tell me about him?

24:34.601 --> 24:36.490
Well, before he lived in that property,

24:36.491 --> 24:40.428
he had purchased 56 acres
of land, kind of adjacent.

24:40.429 --> 24:44.531
He lived there with his wife,
Elizabeth, and they had a daughter.

24:44.532 --> 24:46.367
- Her name was Emma Jay.
- Okay.

24:46.368 --> 24:50.404
And then the fire of 1881
wiped out everything.

24:50.405 --> 24:53.140
So, how did this fire affect the coopers?

24:53.141 --> 24:55.834
At that time, Elizabeth was pregnant.

24:55.835 --> 24:58.124
She gave birth to a little boy.

24:58.125 --> 24:59.154
Okay.

24:59.155 --> 25:03.223
A week after that, Elizabeth
had a heart attack and died.

25:03.224 --> 25:08.367
So now, Harrison is left with his
daughter, Emma Jay, and a baby.

25:08.368 --> 25:12.292
Six weeks later, the baby
died because of malnutrition.

25:12.293 --> 25:13.876
Oh, geez.

25:13.877 --> 25:15.890
Now, how does he move on? What happened?

25:15.891 --> 25:18.578
The next year, he married
his Sister-in-law.

25:18.579 --> 25:23.006
And in 1894, he purchased the
property that you're investigating.

25:23.007 --> 25:25.891
His daughter Emma and her
husband lived with them.

25:25.892 --> 25:29.848
Then, in 1903, another tragedy struck.

25:29.849 --> 25:32.628
Emma gave birth, but the
baby was stillborn.

25:32.629 --> 25:34.700
- Now loses a grandchild.
- Yes.

25:34.701 --> 25:37.699
Here's a copy of the death certificate.

25:37.700 --> 25:39.333
What did they do with the body?

25:39.334 --> 25:45.234
Back in those days, they would have
buried the body on the property.

25:54.164 --> 25:55.554
There's a woman crying.

25:55.555 --> 25:58.790
Real, real, like, sobbing.

25:58.791 --> 26:00.192
She's sobbing.

26:00.193 --> 26:05.053
And then somebody says,
"well, the baby died".

26:06.165 --> 26:07.932
It's horrible.

26:07.933 --> 26:10.102
She's holding the dead baby.

26:10.103 --> 26:14.639
She's, like, petting it or
something, it looks like.

26:14.640 --> 26:18.441
And then she's got blood
all over her dress.

26:18.442 --> 26:21.742
This lady, she's fading.

26:23.998 --> 26:26.614
But she doesn't want to
fade away she actually,

26:26.615 --> 26:30.822
doesn't want to because she likes
to be around those memories.

26:30.823 --> 26:33.158
Even though they're bad.

26:33.159 --> 26:36.346
So she's trying to hold on.

26:36.347 --> 26:39.827
She doesn't want to leave.

26:47.006 --> 26:50.368
During my walk, I saw two black
masses in the upstairs bedroom,

26:50.369 --> 26:53.903
that felt so threatening I
had to try and sketch them.

26:53.904 --> 26:56.380
It's these two...

26:56.381 --> 26:58.682
Round, black...

26:58.683 --> 27:00.723
Things.

27:01.662 --> 27:04.561
They're looking at whoever's on the bed.

27:04.562 --> 27:07.425
And they're on each side of the room.

27:07.426 --> 27:10.428
How close would you say it came to the bed?

27:10.429 --> 27:12.325
Okay.

27:12.326 --> 27:16.646
This one is coming out of the dresser.

27:23.108 --> 27:26.468
Amy, is that about right?

27:28.347 --> 27:30.207
Yes.

27:56.854 --> 27:59.206
Amy, this is Chrystal,

27:59.207 --> 28:02.392
Brittany, their daughter,
and Mike, her husband.

28:02.393 --> 28:04.439
Chrystal inherited this
house from her parents,

28:04.440 --> 28:06.897
who sadly passed away a few years back.

28:06.898 --> 28:10.734
And Chrystal's mom had a dream of turning
this place into a bed-and-breakfast,

28:10.735 --> 28:12.002
and she'd like to do the same.

28:12.003 --> 28:15.306
But since they moved in
about a year or so ago,

28:15.307 --> 28:17.541
they've been going through
some horrific things.

28:17.542 --> 28:20.138
They're actually scared to be here.

28:20.139 --> 28:21.716
Leaving here is not an option.

28:21.717 --> 28:24.416
So, with that being said, what I'll
do is I'll turn it over to Amy,

28:24.417 --> 28:29.217
and she can start telling
us about her walk.

28:31.556 --> 28:35.592
I saw that something bad happened outside.

28:35.593 --> 28:39.741
And I heard people screaming and yelling.

28:39.742 --> 28:45.642
And then I saw like 15 to 20 bodies just
kind of scattered around on the ground.

28:46.118 --> 28:48.536
One of them was a child.

28:48.537 --> 28:53.119
Like, I see this one woman, and she's
laying there, and she's in blood.

28:53.120 --> 28:57.500
And I do see a little boy who's dead.

28:58.771 --> 29:02.490
Back in 1871, there was a
huge fire here that killed

29:02.491 --> 29:04.896
a few hundred people, and
there were bodies everywhere.

29:04.897 --> 29:07.718
- So, hundreds of people died?
- Yeah.

29:07.719 --> 29:12.356
Then again, in 1881, another
fire just wiped everything out.

29:12.357 --> 29:14.908
It actually destroyed
about 56 acres of land

29:14.909 --> 29:17.938
that was owned by this guy Harrison Cooper.

29:17.939 --> 29:20.193
The interesting thing
about Harrison Cooper,

29:20.194 --> 29:25.170
his wife was pregnant during
the time of the fire.

29:25.171 --> 29:29.758
She gave birth within a few days
after the fire to a baby boy.

29:29.759 --> 29:33.383
She dies of a heart attack
a couple days after that.

29:33.384 --> 29:36.903
Unfortunately, six weeks
later, the baby died.

29:36.904 --> 29:39.424
- Wow.
- Wow.

29:42.324 --> 29:45.227
I'm doing my opening and...

29:45.228 --> 29:49.450
There's this man that came into my body.

29:49.451 --> 29:55.034
And so, I'm seeing things through
his eyes, because we meshed.

29:55.035 --> 29:58.907
He wanted to do the whole walk like that.

29:58.908 --> 30:02.015
So that he would be talking through me.

30:02.016 --> 30:04.291
Well, that's really dangerous.

30:04.292 --> 30:06.264
I kicked him out, and...

30:06.265 --> 30:07.614
What did he look like?

30:07.615 --> 30:10.615
He was a big guy...

30:11.073 --> 30:12.464
Very husky.

30:12.465 --> 30:13.727
Why did you ask her that?

30:13.728 --> 30:17.088
Because I've seen a man.

30:17.792 --> 30:19.338
It's a dark shadow.

30:19.339 --> 30:22.339
- Is he big?
- Yep.

30:24.780 --> 30:28.800
- Are you okay?
- Yeah? All right.

30:32.058 --> 30:34.074
- Is he dangerous?
- Yes.

30:34.075 --> 30:35.476
Say, you're sleeping.

30:35.477 --> 30:40.150
The distinction between reality
and dreams can get blurred.

30:40.151 --> 30:42.032
She's having nightmares.

30:42.033 --> 30:44.218
- I do.
- Okay.

30:44.219 --> 30:46.654
Does he come and go, or
is he here all the time?

30:46.655 --> 30:49.315
It seems like he's here all the time.

30:49.316 --> 30:50.690
Does he watch us?

30:50.691 --> 30:52.059
Well, yeah.

30:52.060 --> 30:54.526
Well, I feel like I'm being
watched, that's why I asked.

30:54.527 --> 30:57.262
- Where?
- In my upstairs bedroom.

30:57.263 --> 31:00.143
And in the hallway.

31:00.144 --> 31:04.044
This is kind of freaking me out.

31:04.162 --> 31:05.978
Okay. So, what else did you see?

31:05.979 --> 31:09.209
When I went upstairs, I
heard this woman sobbing...

31:09.210 --> 31:11.037
Really crying, like, hard.

31:11.038 --> 31:13.877
Like from her stomach, you know?

31:13.878 --> 31:18.401
I heard someone say, "well, the baby died".

31:18.402 --> 31:20.776
I saw blood all over her.

31:20.777 --> 31:22.667
And then she was holding the baby

31:22.668 --> 31:25.340
- and, like, petting it in a weird way.
- Ah, geez.

31:25.341 --> 31:28.521
And the baby was dead.

31:29.439 --> 31:33.321
A lot of things that happened here
were very disturbing for her.

31:33.322 --> 31:35.571
Well, that makes sense to me then.

31:35.572 --> 31:37.312
The guy Harrison Cooper
I was talking about?

31:37.313 --> 31:40.295
When he moved to this property,
his daughter Emma Jay,

31:40.296 --> 31:42.230
she was living here with her husband.

31:42.231 --> 31:45.283
She wound up having a stillborn baby here.

31:45.284 --> 31:49.694
Matter of fact, it was in 1903, but they
still had a death certificate for her.

31:49.695 --> 31:54.919
What I was told, the baby's
probably buried on the property.

31:54.920 --> 31:57.898
So you're saying you think that it's Emma?

31:57.899 --> 32:01.079
It would seem like it.

32:01.414 --> 32:03.581
Okay. What else did you see?

32:03.582 --> 32:07.586
I went back outside and
went across the street.

32:07.587 --> 32:12.652
And we're walking down there, and all of a
sudden, I felt really, really, really sad.

32:12.653 --> 32:15.743
Like somebody had just died.

32:15.744 --> 32:21.644
I'm feeling this girl, and I'm hearing
this woman calling for this girl.

32:22.262 --> 32:25.689
"Where are you? Where are you?"

32:25.690 --> 32:27.211
Who does that sound like?

32:27.212 --> 32:28.862
Yeah. Minnie Quay.

32:28.863 --> 32:29.866
Huh?

32:29.867 --> 32:31.669
It was a town legend
that she killed herself,

32:31.670 --> 32:34.004
she was 15 years old, she
threw herself in the river.

32:34.005 --> 32:37.169
Right over here by the dock.

32:37.170 --> 32:39.358
Because she was in a relationship with a...

32:39.359 --> 32:41.000
- Merchant sailor.
- Oh, man.

32:41.001 --> 32:45.222
So, he was out to sea, and
word got back that he died.

32:45.223 --> 32:47.123
- His ship went down.
- Oh, no.

32:47.124 --> 32:49.759
She walked down the block from her house,

32:49.760 --> 32:53.627
walked up to the lake,
and then she jumped in.

32:53.628 --> 32:57.733
So, the men used grappling hooks
to get her out of the water.

32:57.734 --> 33:01.581
This has been told to
us since we were kids.

33:01.582 --> 33:03.817
So, this is more than a town legend?

33:03.818 --> 33:04.918
Yeah.

33:04.919 --> 33:09.239
The girl you say that's here, could
that be Minnie Quay, the same girl?

33:09.240 --> 33:11.628
I think it very well could be.

33:11.629 --> 33:15.208
She might be going between
different locations all the time.

33:15.209 --> 33:19.348
It could be more than just this house.

33:19.349 --> 33:25.249
So, the next person that I met when I
came back into the house was a girl.

33:25.255 --> 33:28.423
And she was kind of wild
and crazy for her time.

33:28.424 --> 33:32.390
And she was very much the
black sheep of the family.

33:32.391 --> 33:36.856
It's interesting you're saying that because
it kind of sounds like Minnie Quay.

33:36.857 --> 33:39.726
She kind of told everybody that
her and this guy were engaged.

33:39.727 --> 33:42.366
There's no records for it because
everything burned in the fire,

33:42.367 --> 33:45.366
but the father was very strict, he
thought this sailor was beneath her.

33:45.367 --> 33:47.039
And he locked her up...

33:47.040 --> 33:50.614
I mean, physically locked her up in her
room so she couldn't get out to see him.

33:50.615 --> 33:52.612
She was very physical...

33:52.613 --> 33:55.377
Capable of having physical interaction.

33:55.378 --> 33:57.831
She is very bored.

33:57.832 --> 34:01.688
And she likes to get
reactions for her behaviors.

34:01.689 --> 34:04.331
Does she move things?

34:04.332 --> 34:07.272
She's capable, yes.

34:07.361 --> 34:10.830
I came in one time, and I walked
back into the dining room,

34:10.831 --> 34:15.668
and the door slammed upstairs
so hard the whole house shook.

34:15.668 --> 34:17.570
- Wow.
- The foundation shook.

34:17.571 --> 34:19.821
Oh, my gosh.

34:19.822 --> 34:22.462
It's the girl.

34:24.645 --> 34:26.145
So, what else did you see then?

34:26.146 --> 34:27.875
So...

34:27.876 --> 34:31.356
This part was uncomfortable.

34:32.157 --> 34:37.768
So, I went into a room with a pink bed,
and I did not feel good in there at all.

34:37.768 --> 34:42.900
I got really, really bad chills,
like in different parts of my body.

34:42.902 --> 34:48.802
Then I'm looking, and I see these two
dark things in each corner of the room.

34:51.042 --> 34:55.587
They're very tall, and I
felt like they were trying

34:55.588 --> 34:59.248
to reach something or someone.

34:59.410 --> 35:02.956
Because they're coming in towards the bed.

35:02.957 --> 35:07.397
And they are just sitting there watching.

35:07.704 --> 35:11.124
They're very, very creepy.

35:22.351 --> 35:24.631
I see it.

35:37.893 --> 35:43.533
I see these two dark things
in each corner of the room.

35:44.547 --> 35:49.238
They're very tall, and I
felt like they were trying

35:49.239 --> 35:52.899
to reach something or someone.

35:53.015 --> 35:56.578
Because they're coming in towards the bed.

35:56.579 --> 36:01.019
And they are just sitting there watching.

36:09.371 --> 36:11.651
I see it.

36:14.587 --> 36:19.807
I've seen it watch me and
my mom in the doorway.

36:28.662 --> 36:32.622
And I feel it watch me at night.

36:33.318 --> 36:36.258
And I can't sleep.

36:36.888 --> 36:39.356
I wake up in the middle of the night.

36:39.357 --> 36:42.893
I don't even want to get out
of bed because it scares me.

36:42.894 --> 36:46.374
I feel like they watch me.

36:46.397 --> 36:48.365
I've seen it.

36:48.366 --> 36:54.066
It's tall, and it's black,
and I can't see through it.

36:59.238 --> 37:03.498
I did sketch what I saw in her room.

37:04.116 --> 37:07.296
It looks a little odd.

37:16.971 --> 37:19.251
Oh, Jesus.

37:19.574 --> 37:21.554
Now...

37:21.901 --> 37:27.421
Does this look similar to
what you saw in the doorway?

37:30.050 --> 37:33.530
Yeah. I can't see a face.

37:33.732 --> 37:39.552
These things can make you feel
sick and dizzy and nauseous.

37:39.960 --> 37:42.696
And this one is sadness.

37:42.697 --> 37:46.089
This one makes you hurt inside.

37:46.090 --> 37:48.912
Or your heart's beating,
and your head's dizzy.

37:48.913 --> 37:51.164
This one's making us feel like that?

37:51.165 --> 37:52.403
Oh, yeah.

37:52.404 --> 37:54.501
Yeah, it's very hard to
control your emotions here.

37:54.502 --> 37:58.822
I feel like we're all over the place.

38:03.542 --> 38:07.711
So, when you're seeing the dark
mass bopping around the house,

38:07.712 --> 38:12.932
I think that's the man
doing those things to you.

38:13.254 --> 38:17.206
The male who was trying to jump me...

38:17.207 --> 38:22.044
This is just a part of him,
that nasty emotional part.

38:22.045 --> 38:24.442
But then there's also this
separate conscious entity,

38:24.443 --> 38:26.949
that he is like, his own person.

38:26.950 --> 38:28.714
The dead male?

38:28.715 --> 38:30.419
Maybe this Harrison?

38:30.420 --> 38:33.473
- Harrison Cooper?
- Yes.

38:33.474 --> 38:37.559
And then this one is aspects of
the woman who lost the child.

38:37.560 --> 38:39.629
- That's his daughter?
- Yes.

38:39.630 --> 38:40.730
Okay.

38:40.731 --> 38:44.562
So, these are always in that room.

38:44.563 --> 38:49.663
And what they want to do
is, they want to grow.

38:49.676 --> 38:51.847
These dark masses are the very beginnings

38:51.848 --> 38:54.039
of psychokinetic manifestations.

38:54.040 --> 38:56.208
Usually these are formed by the living,

38:56.209 --> 39:02.109
but in this case, it's the dead
here that have created them.

39:02.682 --> 39:06.518
Typically, it's affiliated
with living people.

39:06.519 --> 39:09.054
But what I'm seeing is
that conscious dead people

39:09.055 --> 39:13.364
are also creating these types of entities.

39:13.365 --> 39:16.990
It's because they're not dealing
with their emotions properly.

39:16.991 --> 39:19.811
And it's growing.

39:19.923 --> 39:23.814
Like, it's actually kind of
forming a consciousness.

39:23.815 --> 39:25.364
What happens if they grow?

39:25.365 --> 39:28.495
It would become its own entity.

39:28.496 --> 39:31.084
That would be really, really bad.

39:31.085 --> 39:34.246
The problem is that they
can be very physical.

39:34.247 --> 39:38.987
I mean, these guys can cause a lot of harm.

39:39.182 --> 39:43.080
They're reaching out, I
think, because of your age.

39:43.081 --> 39:47.449
A lot of poltergeist hauntings
will be around teenagers.

39:47.450 --> 39:50.175
And they'll be the conduit for it.

39:50.176 --> 39:53.699
These things feed off of the
living person's energy.

39:53.700 --> 39:55.400
- Me, or my parents, too?
- Yeah.

39:55.401 --> 39:57.261
You.

40:09.115 --> 40:11.416
Now that you've seen the
results of the investigation,

40:11.417 --> 40:14.942
you know why things have been going wrong
since you moved into your parents' house.

40:14.943 --> 40:19.725
The big question is, is it safe for you to
stay, and can you fulfill your mom's dream?

40:19.726 --> 40:24.346
With that, I have to turn it over to Amy.

40:26.166 --> 40:30.002
Well, the first thing is
that you do need a medium.

40:30.003 --> 40:34.306
To come back and help to move Minnie on...

40:34.307 --> 40:39.587
Not talk to her, not do
anything, just to move on.

40:40.346 --> 40:43.182
That medium, after doing that with her,

40:43.183 --> 40:47.552
needs to go up into your
room and go to the corner,

40:47.553 --> 40:51.923
then ask the male that's
here to receive this back...

40:51.924 --> 40:55.268
As part of him so he's whole.

40:55.269 --> 40:57.836
And then she moves him on.

40:57.837 --> 41:00.065
Then she needs to deal with this.

41:00.066 --> 41:05.137
And what she needs to do there is
she needs to collect the energy.

41:05.138 --> 41:07.975
And then she needs to
take it out of the house.

41:07.976 --> 41:10.784
It's just funky emotional energy

41:10.785 --> 41:14.246
that needs to be contained
and removed from the house.

41:14.247 --> 41:18.147
And the medium needs to do that.

41:18.184 --> 41:20.352
The other thing would be for you

41:20.353 --> 41:22.683
to go ahead and sleep in
another area of the house.

41:22.684 --> 41:26.758
Because it would take quite some
time for these things to reroute.

41:26.759 --> 41:28.967
So if you're sleeping in
another area of the house,

41:28.968 --> 41:32.430
that would be much more beneficial for you.

41:32.431 --> 41:34.439
So, where are you sleeping tonight?

41:34.440 --> 41:36.657
I don't know. Not in my room.

41:36.658 --> 41:38.170
- Okay.
- I won't sleep in there.

41:38.171 --> 41:41.623
I wouldn't sleep in your room right now.

41:41.624 --> 41:42.647
No way.

41:42.648 --> 41:45.201
Bottom line, they get all this done...

41:45.202 --> 41:46.204
Mm-hmm.

41:46.205 --> 41:48.400
Is Chrystal and her family
gonna be able to stay here

41:48.401 --> 41:50.348
and turn this place into
a bed-and-breakfast?

41:50.349 --> 41:52.929
Possibly, yeah.

41:53.619 --> 41:56.255
Now, you're gonna follow
Amy's advice, obviously.

41:56.256 --> 41:57.810
Oh, I'm gonna do it.

41:57.811 --> 42:01.711
And then we'll just continue on.

42:04.397 --> 42:06.698
If Chrystal and her
family bring in a medium,

42:06.699 --> 42:10.067
they should be able to get rid of
the poltergeist manifestations.

42:10.068 --> 42:14.954
And hopefully make their dream of
opening a bed-and-breakfast come true.
