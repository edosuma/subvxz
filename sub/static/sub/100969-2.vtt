Did you see that?

14:32.496 --> 14:33.956
They're in yearbook together.

14:34.456 --> 14:35.666
It's probably nothing.

14:36.709 --> 14:39.712
That's how he knows.
That's how he got into my locker.

14:40.588 --> 14:41.755
What else does he know?

15:01.358 --> 15:03.319
We have to tell everyone about Winston,
at least.

15:03.402 --> 15:04.361
We don't.

15:04.445 --> 15:06.655
All that will accomplish is mass panic.

15:06.947 --> 15:09.825
We can huddle with everyone 
during the tour, slip away at some point.

15:10.200 --> 15:11.327
It's the perfect time.

15:11.744 --> 15:13.078
Perfect timing for what?

15:16.123 --> 15:17.124
-What?
-Nothing.

15:19.627 --> 15:21.253
Ah-ah-ah, good morning, seniors.

15:21.670 --> 15:22.588
Shit. Bolan.

15:22.671 --> 15:25.299
-[Bolan] Really exciting day.
-What the fuck is he doing here?

15:25.382 --> 15:28.928
Now, I know that many of you
tend to overlook Sanderson

15:29.470 --> 15:32.181
because it's so close to home,
but the reality is

15:32.264 --> 15:35.976
it's one of the foremost small,
private universities in the country,

15:36.060 --> 15:41.482
with, fun fact,
an award-winning literature department

15:41.565 --> 15:46.195
headed by the father
of our very own Clay Jensen.

15:46.570 --> 15:48.614
[scattered applause]

15:49.281 --> 15:53.661
[Bolan] I'm very thrilled
to be among you for this tour.

15:54.078 --> 15:55.829
So I expect each of you to be on...

15:56.538 --> 15:57.498
your best behavior.

15:57.957 --> 16:00.334
-What the fuck?
-Did either of you see--

16:00.417 --> 16:02.544
-Fucking get rid of it.
-What, out the window?

16:05.047 --> 16:06.382
[Bolan] Room for one more?

16:07.216 --> 16:08.050
Huh?

16:13.389 --> 16:16.684
Yeah, I used to sit in the back of the bus
when I was a kid.

16:16.767 --> 16:18.727
It was easier to get away with stuff.
Yeah.

16:19.353 --> 16:21.105
It was a bit of trouble. [chuckles]

16:23.107 --> 16:26.360
Mr. Padilla, can't remember the last time
you and I had a chat.

16:26.443 --> 16:27.903
How's your senior year going?

16:28.821 --> 16:30.406
[Tony] It's... going.

16:30.864 --> 16:33.993
[Bolan] So you're finding
a good work-school balance?

16:34.827 --> 16:37.413
[Clay]  The campus tour
was clearly just another opportunity

16:37.496 --> 16:39.373
for things to get royally fucked up.

16:39.873 --> 16:40.874
And they did.

16:41.709 --> 16:44.712
-We've gotta find a trash can.
-Yeah, but not in front of Bolan. Fuck.

16:44.795 --> 16:47.297
I gotta watch Jess. If she loses her shit
on Justin again, then--

16:47.381 --> 16:49.133
Wait. What about Winston and Tyler?

16:49.675 --> 16:50.718
Over there.

16:52.177 --> 16:53.470
Split up. Stay low.

16:58.475 --> 16:59.435
[Mr. Jensen] Clay.

17:00.436 --> 17:01.770
Ani. Hi.

17:02.563 --> 17:03.605
Hey, Dad.

17:03.689 --> 17:05.315
I'm your official tour greeter.

17:06.108 --> 17:07.693
Consider us officially greeted.

17:07.776 --> 17:09.653
Hi, Mr. Jensen. Excuse me--

17:09.737 --> 17:11.989
How beautiful is this place?

17:12.072 --> 17:14.366
I can't believe
I've lived in Evergreen this entire time,

17:14.450 --> 17:16.535
-and I've never been here.
-I hope you guys don't mind,

17:16.618 --> 17:19.121
I arranged a meeting with the Dean
of Admissions after the tour.

17:19.538 --> 17:22.499
-Thank you. That's awesome. [chuckles]
-Does that sound good?

17:23.834 --> 17:24.710
Clay?

17:25.210 --> 17:27.838
-Yeah, that sounds great.
-[Bolan] Professor Jensen.

17:28.756 --> 17:31.258
-Hi, thank you so much for hosting.
-My pleasure, Gary.

17:31.341 --> 17:33.594
I thought I might join you
on the first few stops, sir.

17:33.677 --> 17:35.846
I just wanted to continue our discussion
for a minute.

17:35.929 --> 17:37.139
-Sure.
-OK, yeah.

17:39.349 --> 17:40.225
What...

17:40.976 --> 17:43.562
what was that? Why'd he call him Gary?
What discussion?

17:43.645 --> 17:45.856
I'm sure they just know each other, right?

17:46.774 --> 17:47.775
I didn't think so.

17:48.484 --> 17:51.028
Two groups, please! Two groups!

17:51.111 --> 17:52.112
Shit!

17:56.617 --> 17:59.536
-[teacher] Group one, this way, please!
-Hey, Alex, you OK?

18:00.454 --> 18:03.207
Can we make a rule
that we stop asking each other that?

18:06.376 --> 18:08.504
Um... I'm gonna walk with you,
I just gotta--

18:08.587 --> 18:10.923
Clay Jensen, back to your group, please.

18:11.465 --> 18:13.759
Fuck, shit, OK.
Can you keep an eye on Tyler?

18:13.842 --> 18:15.427
Wait. What? Did something happen?

18:15.511 --> 18:18.388
Nothing. It may be nothing.
Just watch him, all right?

18:18.472 --> 18:20.599
OK. Wait.
Will you do the same with Zach?

18:21.558 --> 18:23.769
You don't think he would do anything,
do you?

18:23.852 --> 18:25.312
I don't fucking know anymore.

18:25.771 --> 18:26.897
[teacher] Clay Jensen!

18:41.286 --> 18:42.329
[Bolan] Mr. Jensen.

18:43.539 --> 18:44.414
[Clay] Uh...

18:45.833 --> 18:49.253
-Hey.
-Your dad's campus is quite nice.

18:51.547 --> 18:53.006
Well, he doesn't own it.

18:53.090 --> 18:54.216
Well, of course.

18:54.758 --> 18:58.846
Um, I thought you might have some thoughts
about the graffiti this morning.

19:00.013 --> 19:03.433
No. I mean, uh... no.

19:03.517 --> 19:07.604
Well, I should just tell you
that we received a tip anonymously

19:08.355 --> 19:11.817
from someone saying
you might have done it.

19:15.320 --> 19:19.449
That's... That doesn't make sense
for me to do that.

19:19.533 --> 19:20.409
I agree.

19:20.492 --> 19:22.035
Just wonder who said you did.

19:25.873 --> 19:27.708
-I don't know.
-All right.

19:27.791 --> 19:29.293
Well, if you hear anything…

19:35.632 --> 19:36.633
What'd he want?

19:40.846 --> 19:41.680
Nothing.

19:56.153 --> 19:58.322
You don't really think
you can trace the paint?

19:59.531 --> 20:03.452
There's only a few stores in Evergreen
that are authorized to sell spray paint.

20:04.203 --> 20:07.372
They're required to take identification
and log purchases.

20:07.456 --> 20:09.124
[inhales then exhales deeply]

20:09.208 --> 20:11.543
We find the brand. We check the stores.

20:12.085 --> 20:13.420
[chuckles] All right.

20:14.296 --> 20:15.297
Let me know.

20:21.136 --> 20:24.348
Greek life is a huge part of our campus
here at SU.

20:24.431 --> 20:27.309
I'm proud to call myself
a part of the Greek community.

20:27.392 --> 20:31.396
It's truly one of the most
rewarding experiences of college.

20:31.480 --> 20:35.150
One of my favorite parts of sorority life
is the service projects

20:35.234 --> 20:37.819
we support every semester. Last year...

20:39.238 --> 20:40.155
What?

20:42.282 --> 20:43.825
What? We're walking together.

20:44.910 --> 20:46.161
No, I'm walking this way.

20:47.704 --> 20:49.081
Hey, no. Dude, no.

20:50.832 --> 20:52.709
What better way
to learn about college life

20:52.793 --> 20:54.253
than actually experiencing it?

20:55.671 --> 20:56.672
Zach, no.

20:57.839 --> 20:58.840
What are you...

20:59.758 --> 21:00.801
Enjoy the tour.

21:00.884 --> 21:01.802
Zach!

21:03.470 --> 21:05.347
[Clay]  I ditched the tour because, well…

21:05.430 --> 21:06.306
Fuck!

21:06.974 --> 21:09.059
…I didn't want Zach getting into trouble.

21:09.643 --> 21:13.063
Sanderson University is known
for its state-of-the-art facilities.

21:13.146 --> 21:14.189
And that's true…

21:14.564 --> 21:17.067
-I'll catch up with you guys in a bit.
-Wait, where are you going?

21:17.150 --> 21:20.821
The entablature on this building,
it's really impressive. I want to get it.

21:21.655 --> 21:23.282
He  loves  his architecture.

21:23.365 --> 21:24.241
Yeah.

21:25.033 --> 21:26.743
You guys been friends for a while?

21:27.536 --> 21:29.997
Uh... kind of since last year.

21:30.080 --> 21:31.331
He's a good guy.

21:32.040 --> 21:35.836
-He's strange sometimes.
-Can be a little awkward.

21:35.919 --> 21:39.381
Yeah, though not as awkward
as Jeremy the tour guide.

21:39.464 --> 21:42.676
So, this is the Life Sciences building
on your right.

21:42.759 --> 21:45.846
Students here are encouraged
to pursue all their passions.

21:45.929 --> 21:49.558
That's why
I'm a bioengineering/modern dance major.

21:50.434 --> 21:53.562
Pretty much everyone you'll see here
is a "slasher" too.

21:54.438 --> 21:57.524
He actually did the air quotes.

21:57.607 --> 21:58.984
Maybe it was modern dance.

21:59.067 --> 22:00.193
Yeah. [chuckles]

22:00.277 --> 22:02.904
[female tour guide]
The School of Architecture is housed

22:02.988 --> 22:05.532
in one of the most significant buildings
on campus.

22:07.868 --> 22:09.578
Jess, do you know where Clay went?

22:10.495 --> 22:11.705
Look at Justin.

22:12.789 --> 22:15.000
Totally crushing on that Amanda.

22:15.083 --> 22:16.835
Oh, God. Thank you. [giggles]

22:17.627 --> 22:18.545
Excuse me?

22:18.628 --> 22:20.255
-Amanda?
-Yes?

22:20.339 --> 22:23.759
Yeah, your website claims that Sanderson
has a rate of sexual assault

22:23.842 --> 22:25.844
that's way below the national average.

22:25.927 --> 22:29.431
But isn't it true that most claims
are adjudicated in private sessions

22:29.514 --> 22:33.018
with no transparency
or legal responsibility?

22:34.311 --> 22:35.395
Uh... [sighs]

22:35.937 --> 22:37.230
I don't know.

22:37.314 --> 22:39.983
Well, as a woman on campus,
you should find out.

22:42.486 --> 22:43.987
Our student body president.

22:45.655 --> 22:46.531
OK...

22:47.157 --> 22:48.200
[rock music plays]

22:48.283 --> 22:49.201
Nice.

22:49.368 --> 22:50.994
Go!

22:51.078 --> 22:53.580
-[guys cheer and chant]
-[guy 1] Don't suck!

22:58.752 --> 23:00.837
If anyone finds out
we're still in high school--

23:00.921 --> 23:02.881
Dude, half the kids here
are probably underage.

23:02.964 --> 23:03.840
-Don't worry.
-Right,

23:03.924 --> 23:05.842
but should we really be playing
a drinking game?

23:05.926 --> 23:07.719
If you're worried,
why's this your third round?

23:07.803 --> 23:08.762
I'm here because of you.

23:08.845 --> 23:10.389
If that's what you need
to tell yourself,

23:10.472 --> 23:12.682
but if you're here because of me,
I'm staying.

23:12.766 --> 23:13.975
[guys] Go!

23:15.102 --> 23:16.520
-Go!
-[Clay] Shit!

23:22.150 --> 23:23.193
Come on! Flip!

23:24.403 --> 23:25.612
-Yeah!
-[guy 2] Come on!

23:25.695 --> 23:28.323
[chanting] Corey!

23:28.407 --> 23:29.658
Feels good, doesn't it?

23:29.741 --> 23:31.493
Corey!

23:31.576 --> 23:32.869
It does for Corey.

23:32.953 --> 23:34.413
[Clay]  Why am I always Corey?

23:34.788 --> 23:37.624
[guys chanting] Corey!

23:40.585 --> 23:42.337
-[Zach] Let's run it back.
-All right!

23:43.004 --> 23:44.423
-[Zach] Let's go!
-High five!

23:48.885 --> 23:50.554
[stumbling footsteps]

23:50.846 --> 23:51.888
[girl] Oh, shit.

23:58.645 --> 24:00.689
Oh, my God, the day drinking.

24:00.772 --> 24:02.983
-Right?
-Are you OK?

24:03.442 --> 24:05.110
[guy 3] Hey. Babe?

24:06.153 --> 24:08.780
Brady? You got me drunk!

24:09.906 --> 24:11.825
[Brady] You and tequila are bad news.

24:12.117 --> 24:13.785
Come on, let's get you upstairs.

24:13.869 --> 24:15.620
-Sleep it off.
-[girl groans]

24:16.204 --> 24:17.622
[footsteps receding]

24:49.154 --> 24:50.614
[belt buckle jangling]

24:52.741 --> 24:53.658
Hey!

24:56.953 --> 24:58.538
She's all yours, Jensen.

24:58.622 --> 24:59.831
Don't let me stop you.

25:01.374 --> 25:05.837
Oh, come on, you know you wanna fuck her.
And you know she wants you to, so...

25:07.339 --> 25:08.173
do it.

25:08.840 --> 25:11.134
Do it, go ahead. Go on, come on. Fuck her.

25:11.968 --> 25:14.304
I can't... I can't do that.

25:14.387 --> 25:15.764
What? Why? Why not?

25:16.431 --> 25:18.767
I mean,
that guy said he'd be in the next room.

25:18.850 --> 25:20.018
That's your response?

25:20.101 --> 25:22.103
Not, "I would never do that"?

25:22.979 --> 25:24.773
[chuckles] That's fucked up.

25:25.732 --> 25:27.526
Or maybe you're starting to get it.

25:27.609 --> 25:29.277
[panting] Get what?

25:29.945 --> 25:31.238
What you're capable of.

25:32.489 --> 25:33.657
Who you really are.

25:36.785 --> 25:38.286
[Brady] Who the fuck are you?

25:39.746 --> 25:40.580
I...

25:42.123 --> 25:44.084
No, I wasn't... I was just...

25:44.167 --> 25:46.670
You were just what?
Get the fuck away from her!

25:50.131 --> 25:53.134
I'm about to show you guys
how you're gonna get dominated real quick.

25:53.218 --> 25:54.594
-Throw some balls--
-Zach!

25:54.678 --> 25:55.971
-Oh, shit!
-Sorry!

25:56.054 --> 25:57.472
-[Zach] What?
-Sorry!

25:58.014 --> 25:59.724
Wait, my backpack.

26:00.308 --> 26:02.852
Wait, where the fuck is my backpack?
Where the fuck--

26:02.936 --> 26:04.688
Right here, man.
What the fuck is going on?

26:04.771 --> 26:06.606
-Stop that little fucker!
-[Zach] What the fuck?

26:06.690 --> 26:08.817
-Wait. No.
-Clay, what the fuck did you do?

26:08.900 --> 26:09.734
Nothing, I swear,

26:09.818 --> 26:12.988
-I walked into the wrong room.
-All right, calm down. I know this guy.

26:13.071 --> 26:14.197
Hey! Hold him!

26:14.281 --> 26:15.323
-No!
-What'd he do, Brady?

26:15.407 --> 26:17.659
Please, let me go.

26:17.742 --> 26:19.536
You know what? Grab both of them.

26:19.619 --> 26:21.830
Hey, whoa. We're all friends here.

26:21.913 --> 26:23.164
Are we friends?

26:23.248 --> 26:26.418
Because I have never seen either of you
on campus before today.

26:26.501 --> 26:28.628
So who are you, "friend"?

26:28.712 --> 26:29.546
Please, I…

26:29.629 --> 26:32.507
We were just trying to have a good time,
have a few beers, that's about it.

26:32.591 --> 26:35.218
That what you were trying to have
with my girlfriend, you shit?

26:35.302 --> 26:37.596
-A fucking good time?
-No, it's not what it looks like.

26:37.679 --> 26:38.763
Please just let me go.

26:38.847 --> 26:41.683
What it looked like is
you saw a drunk girl passed out in a bed.

26:41.766 --> 26:43.893
And it looked like
you were gonna try and fuck her.

26:43.977 --> 26:45.395
Clay, what the fuck?

26:45.812 --> 26:46.688
Let me go!

26:47.355 --> 26:54.029
Let me go! Let me go! Let me go!
Let me go! Let me go! Let me go!

26:57.407 --> 26:58.450
[Justin sighs]

27:01.244 --> 27:05.123
So, you're not actually thinking
of going here, are you?

27:05.999 --> 27:07.125
What if I am?

27:07.917 --> 27:11.546
What? What, you're worried I'll get
in between you and Amanda the tour guide?

27:11.630 --> 27:12.589
No. [chuckles]

27:15.050 --> 27:16.760
Why are you not more freaked out?

27:18.303 --> 27:20.263
About college?

27:20.722 --> 27:22.307
No, the graffiti.

27:22.932 --> 27:24.976
Tyler. I mean, everything.

27:25.435 --> 27:28.271
I'm sure it's... going to be fine.

27:29.272 --> 27:30.190
[Jess] Really?

27:30.607 --> 27:33.652
Well, share your secret sauce.
I mean, how are you so sure?

27:35.820 --> 27:37.030
Because I have to be.

27:37.781 --> 27:40.075
Oh, because you didn't actually
do anything.

27:41.034 --> 27:43.453
Or lie or anything,

27:43.536 --> 27:46.873
so you know that you'll just skate
if the rest of us get caught.

27:46.956 --> 27:47.999
What? That's...

27:48.583 --> 27:50.126
How can you say that to me?

27:50.210 --> 27:51.127
This.

27:52.003 --> 27:53.755
I don't recognize this.

27:53.838 --> 27:55.924
I don't know who this is.

27:56.883 --> 27:57.884
It's me.

27:59.678 --> 28:00.970
It's me trying...

28:02.681 --> 28:03.848
trying to get better.

28:06.351 --> 28:08.770
Well, I hope it lasts.

28:15.610 --> 28:16.736
[Alex] But on the other hand,

28:16.820 --> 28:20.407
it must be kind of nice coming to a school
where nobody knows your history.

28:20.865 --> 28:22.325
Um... yeah.

28:23.243 --> 28:24.411
Well, that's true.

28:24.494 --> 28:26.371
[Alex] Yeah, sometimes I wish that...

28:27.914 --> 28:29.040
I mean, I don't know.

28:31.042 --> 28:31.918
What?

28:33.086 --> 28:34.087
What do you wish?

28:34.170 --> 28:37.549
There's just a lot of shit
that I wish never happened.

28:39.676 --> 28:40.677
Like what?

28:42.595 --> 28:43.888
Oh, like, um...

28:45.724 --> 28:47.308
I tried to kill myself.

28:48.435 --> 28:49.394
Oh, Jesus. I...

28:50.812 --> 28:53.189
-I'm sorry.
-Yeah, me too.

28:53.773 --> 28:54.649
Hugely.

28:56.776 --> 29:00.697
Sorry, I didn't mean to make it awkward.
I just don't talk about it very often.

29:00.780 --> 29:02.532
No, it's not awkward.

29:04.075 --> 29:05.326
You should talk about it.

29:07.996 --> 29:09.414
Sorry I got quiet. I just--

29:09.497 --> 29:11.666
Well, I mean, what can you say to that?
[chuckles]

29:13.042 --> 29:14.169
I'm glad you're alive?

29:15.003 --> 29:16.254
Thanks. Yeah.

29:17.672 --> 29:18.673
Yeah, me too.

29:21.217 --> 29:24.220
And I'm sorry that I didn't stay
at that party last summer,

29:24.304 --> 29:27.140
just to make sure that you were OK
after Monty, you know?

29:27.223 --> 29:30.268
I just... needed to get out of there.

29:32.854 --> 29:33.772
No, I get it.

29:33.855 --> 29:36.191
You know,
Monty beat the shit out of me once.

29:38.318 --> 29:39.152
Why?

29:41.446 --> 29:42.655
It's complicated.

29:55.543 --> 29:56.544
Um...

29:57.045 --> 29:59.422
Sorry, I'm not... I'm not gay.

30:01.174 --> 30:02.091
Oh.

30:02.967 --> 30:03.843
Shit.

30:04.844 --> 30:06.179
I thought maybe, uh…

30:07.472 --> 30:08.306
No.

30:08.848 --> 30:09.974
Don't feel bad.

30:11.726 --> 30:12.727
It's OK.

30:13.228 --> 30:14.229
[Winston chuckles]

30:15.647 --> 30:16.481
OK.

30:18.024 --> 30:19.275
Cool, thank you.

30:19.359 --> 30:22.362
Yeah. I mean,
there's no need to thank me, but…

30:25.031 --> 30:26.199
We should probably…

30:26.741 --> 30:32.497
♪  What's luck got to say
To questions of fate, my love? ♪

30:36.751 --> 30:40.296
[Clay]  "Recount a time when you faced

How did it affect you,

from the experience?"

30:46.761 --> 30:50.014
[slurring] Don't know why
a frat house called a seclearity line.

-Security line.

Fair point.

Careful?

Yeah, I've been careful
my whole damn life, Clay.

31:23.172 --> 31:24.048
Zach,

31:25.550 --> 31:26.885
you didn't do it, did you?

31:28.595 --> 31:29.596
The graffiti?

31:32.557 --> 31:33.975
Fuck, no. Wha...

31:35.643 --> 31:37.604
How the fuck could you even ask me that?

31:39.230 --> 31:40.523
Jesus, Clay.

31:41.107 --> 31:42.066
What the hell?

31:42.150 --> 31:44.986
Mr. Jensen, they totally held us hostage.

31:45.069 --> 31:49.032
You're lucky they didn't do a lot worse.
They made some pretty wild accusations.

31:49.115 --> 31:51.409
If it weren't for the fact
the Sigs have zero credibility

31:51.492 --> 31:53.620
with campus security,
we might have a real problem.

31:54.037 --> 31:56.456
What were you boys thinking? Clay?

32:00.960 --> 32:01.961
[sighs heavily]

32:02.420 --> 32:06.883
Well, I told Gary you two were "detained,"
so the bus has left to go back to Liberty.

32:07.800 --> 32:10.720
And, Clay,
you missed the meeting with the dean.

32:14.349 --> 32:17.101
[Clay]  At least my parents have one son
with a future.

32:17.185 --> 32:19.145
This discussion will continue at home.

32:20.188 --> 32:21.105
And, Zach,

32:22.482 --> 32:26.736
-I might have to speak with your mother.
-Oof! Well, I am sorry about that.

32:36.496 --> 32:37.705
Dude, are you OK?

32:37.789 --> 32:38.790
Fuck you.

32:38.873 --> 32:40.875
No, I mean,
you really don't look that great.

32:41.751 --> 32:42.627
Oh!

32:43.461 --> 32:44.921
God, Clay!

32:48.383 --> 32:49.258
Oh!

32:50.051 --> 32:51.344
Wow!

32:52.470 --> 32:53.721
Looks good in here.

32:53.805 --> 32:56.683
Yeah, it's just a few things.

32:57.600 --> 32:58.518
[Jess] Um...

32:59.268 --> 33:03.022
I heard about Zach and Clay.
They got busted at the frat house today?

33:03.106 --> 33:05.108
Clay was minding Zach at the time.

33:05.191 --> 33:07.485
He's been... off.

33:08.319 --> 33:09.654
So has Clay.

33:09.737 --> 33:11.656
So have you, no?

33:12.699 --> 33:13.700
I know.

33:14.117 --> 33:18.162
Look, I'm... really sorry
about all that Justin stuff.

33:19.205 --> 33:21.082
Look, I'll be fine. Don't worry.

33:21.165 --> 33:24.252
We have to hold it together
until graduation.

33:24.627 --> 33:28.256
Or you get into Columbia or some shit,
and I'll never see you again.

33:28.756 --> 33:29.590
No.

33:30.049 --> 33:31.926
Not true. You  will  see me.

33:33.011 --> 33:34.846
This is forever, you and me.

33:36.139 --> 33:38.266
We will get through these next few months.

33:38.641 --> 33:40.351

33:41.853 --> 33:42.854
Forever.

Right. Free.

33:52.030 --> 33:53.656

33:54.782 --> 33:55.783
You OK?

33:57.577 --> 34:00.288
The usual. It's not even a thing anymore.

34:01.122 --> 34:03.332
"We're disappointed. We're worried.

34:04.042 --> 34:06.294
Are the sessions with Dr. Ellman working?"

Are they?

34:10.631 --> 34:12.258
What the fuck does it look like?

34:14.260 --> 34:16.679
Dad's mostly just pissed
I blew off the meeting with the dean.

34:17.138 --> 34:18.765
Because you aced it, I'm sure.

34:21.601 --> 34:22.602
No, I blew it.

34:24.479 --> 34:26.856
Yeah, it's only a matter of time
before I fuck everything up

34:26.939 --> 34:28.649
and just become a junkie again.

34:29.734 --> 34:31.527
-That's not true.
-Really?

34:31.611 --> 34:33.446
'Cause it's kind of
how you've been acting.

34:33.905 --> 34:34.906
I have not.

34:38.034 --> 34:39.077
Yeah, whatever.

34:44.540 --> 34:47.085
So, no sweat.
You'll just go to Occidental.

34:47.293 --> 34:50.838
[scoffs] Even if I do get in,
which, who the hell knows,

34:50.922 --> 34:52.673
it's fucking expensive.

34:52.757 --> 34:54.884
If I go to Sanderson, it's free.

34:54.967 --> 34:57.887
Well, you don't have to go
just because it's free. We're not poor.

34:57.970 --> 35:00.098
I don't want to cost your parents
any more money.

35:00.181 --> 35:04.685
And I don't want to take away
from something that... should be yours.

35:05.686 --> 35:06.521
Oh...

35:06.813 --> 35:08.731
OK, I just want there to be
enough college money

35:08.815 --> 35:10.650
for you to go wherever you want.

35:10.733 --> 35:11.651
I mean,

35:13.444 --> 35:16.197
it's not like I have
fucking options right now, so...

35:16.280 --> 35:19.283
OK, well, look, can I help? With...

35:19.909 --> 35:21.327
With anything?

35:21.911 --> 35:22.745
No.

35:23.496 --> 35:24.497
No, thanks.

35:32.505 --> 35:33.339
Clay.

35:36.217 --> 35:38.803
What exactly were you doing
in the room with that girl?

35:45.685 --> 35:47.311
[Clay]  What exactly was I doing?

35:48.563 --> 35:49.730
What am I doing?

35:50.982 --> 35:52.316
Dear admissions committee,

35:53.317 --> 35:54.819
I am fucking lost.

36:18.301 --> 36:20.303
Working hard for 7:00 a.m.

36:22.013 --> 36:23.347
What are you doing here?

36:23.848 --> 36:24.932
Morning coffee.

36:25.558 --> 36:26.392
You?

36:27.143 --> 36:29.645
-Homework.
-[Winston] Why do you work so hard?

36:29.729 --> 36:32.231
Second semester, senior year…

36:32.315 --> 36:36.194
Well, not all of us have a trust fund
or a family legacy at Princeton.

36:37.278 --> 36:39.238
I don't have any of those things anymore.

36:39.989 --> 36:41.657
So maybe you should be working harder.

36:42.617 --> 36:44.744
[inhales, exhales deeply] Nah.

36:46.120 --> 36:48.748
-I'm dumb.
-Um, yeah, have a seat, I guess.

36:48.831 --> 36:49.874
I'm not smart.

36:51.042 --> 36:54.170
Two centuries of WASP inbreeding,
and this is what I got.

36:56.756 --> 36:58.090
I got a 2.8.

36:58.174 --> 36:59.425
And if I work hard,

37:00.343 --> 37:01.636
it could be a 2.9.

37:02.803 --> 37:04.513
-Lifelong C student.
-Hmm.

37:05.181 --> 37:06.098
I'm OK with it.

37:06.182 --> 37:08.351
That's good for your stress levels,
at least, isn't it?

37:09.560 --> 37:11.020
What are you, a 4.0?

37:11.562 --> 37:12.396
4.4.

37:12.813 --> 37:13.940
Holy shit.

37:14.899 --> 37:16.859
I guess I knew
that was mathematically possible.

37:16.943 --> 37:20.363
OK, what do you want?
Why are you talking to me?

37:20.947 --> 37:23.407
-I'm just trying to be friendly.
-[scoffs] Hardly.

37:23.866 --> 37:25.368
You have spray paint for that.

37:25.826 --> 37:26.827
It wasn't me.

37:27.662 --> 37:28.663
Honest.

37:33.918 --> 37:35.002
[Winston sighs]

37:35.962 --> 37:37.546
Tell me what really happened,

37:38.214 --> 37:41.467
and I swear to you
I'll never mention it again. To anyone.

37:41.550 --> 37:45.137
Just tell me what really happened.

37:46.639 --> 37:47.807
I don't know.

37:54.230 --> 37:55.231
Why lie to me?

37:56.816 --> 37:58.192
What good does that do?

38:07.326 --> 38:09.954
Hey, why'd you ask me to watch Tyler?

38:11.455 --> 38:13.124
Why didn't you text me last night?

38:13.207 --> 38:16.585
Because nothing happened on the tour.
Did you think something would?

38:17.420 --> 38:18.879
You still believe him, right?

38:21.132 --> 38:22.216
Of course.

38:22.925 --> 38:23.759
Really?

38:24.385 --> 38:27.596
Yeah, I just didn't want you to do
anything that might draw attention.

38:27.680 --> 38:30.266
Oh, you mean like getting arrested
at a frat party?

38:31.392 --> 38:33.477
Yeah, I got the report from Zach
this morning.

38:34.061 --> 38:36.689
Um... What the hell happened? Are you OK?

38:37.815 --> 38:39.442
How did Tyler seem on the tour?

38:39.525 --> 38:40.818
Did anything happen?

38:40.901 --> 38:43.404
-Was he acting weird?
-No, he's, like, super normal.

38:43.487 --> 38:45.823
He was all happy to be on the tour
and excited about college.

38:46.240 --> 38:48.617
-Was he hanging out with anyone?
-Not really, why?

38:48.701 --> 38:49.827
Who would he hang out with?

38:50.578 --> 38:51.579
[Winston] Hey, Alex.

38:53.581 --> 38:55.666
-You going to Spanish?
-Um... yeah.

38:56.834 --> 38:58.002
I gotta get to class.

39:00.004 --> 39:01.005
Hey, Clay.

39:07.261 --> 39:09.847
Mr. Jensen? Care to meet me in my office?

39:10.264 --> 39:12.058
[Clay]  I don't know
why they bother asking.

39:12.141 --> 39:15.227
It's not like you have a choice.
There are no choices.

39:15.311 --> 39:18.189
Shit just keeps happening,
and all you can do is react.

39:20.900 --> 39:23.527
I've spoken at length
with your very gracious father.

39:23.611 --> 39:27.531
And since Sanderson is not interested
in pursuing the matter further,

39:28.616 --> 39:30.910
I've decided to leave it alone.

39:31.369 --> 39:34.288
So, I'm not in trouble?

39:34.372 --> 39:40.878
No, but I am interested in your reasons
why you made the choices you made.

39:41.295 --> 39:44.465
See, it's important for me to understand

39:44.548 --> 39:48.552
so I can help you navigate
these next few months at Liberty.

39:49.053 --> 39:53.140
[voice fades, echoes] I know
you've been through an awful lot

39:54.308 --> 39:55.851
these last two years.

39:58.354 --> 40:01.524
I can't imagine what you're feeling...
[trails off]

40:03.692 --> 40:04.652
...the vandalism.

40:07.530 --> 40:08.489
What?

40:08.948 --> 40:10.199
Is it still on your mind?

40:11.283 --> 40:15.413
'Cause I hope you know
that if anyone ever gives you a hard time,

40:15.496 --> 40:17.998
if any problems arise
with you and your friends,

40:18.082 --> 40:19.708
you can come to me directly.

40:20.376 --> 40:21.419
I want to help you,

40:22.753 --> 40:25.631
but I can't do that
if I don't know what's going on.

40:25.714 --> 40:26.715
You understand?

40:29.009 --> 40:30.344
Sure. Thank you.

40:33.639 --> 40:34.723
Oh, sorry.

40:34.807 --> 40:35.975
Just forgot my books.

40:36.350 --> 40:38.352
No, you're fine. It's...

40:39.812 --> 40:41.397
I just like to study down here.

40:41.981 --> 40:44.150
Feels a little more safe.

40:44.233 --> 40:45.192
Yeah. [chuckles]

40:45.276 --> 40:47.236
I mean, that's good that it feels safe.

40:57.746 --> 40:59.957
Hey, um...
would you like to get some coffee?

41:01.083 --> 41:02.668
-Right now?
-Yeah.

41:02.751 --> 41:04.503
I mean, I was just gonna get some.

41:05.713 --> 41:07.381
-Yeah, sure.
-Cool.

41:24.565 --> 41:28.068
So you're not worried about Tyler?
I mean, it's not like him not to show up.

41:28.152 --> 41:29.195
I'm not worried.

41:29.612 --> 41:32.656
OK, I mostly believe you,
but you're training like a madman,

41:32.740 --> 41:34.533
-so I don't know--
-I'm training for a fight.

41:34.617 --> 41:35.784
Like a real fight?

41:36.368 --> 41:38.287
-Does Caleb know?
-Of course he knows.

41:38.621 --> 41:42.541
-'Cause he always says--
-I know what he always says.

41:42.625 --> 41:43.792
I'm gonna do it anyway.

41:46.170 --> 41:49.882
-But you could get seriously hurt, right?
-[chuckles, exhales rhythmically]

41:50.132 --> 41:52.009
And what if they find out you're gay?

41:52.384 --> 41:55.179
-What if?
-That's like a target on your back.

41:55.262 --> 41:57.223
It's boxing. There's a target on my front.

41:57.306 --> 42:00.976
Yeah, it just seems like that world...
I don't know.

42:02.436 --> 42:06.190
Why are you so worried about this, man?
I can fight. You know I can fight.

42:10.611 --> 42:12.321
When did you know that you were gay?

42:14.990 --> 42:15.991
Uh...

42:16.700 --> 42:17.701
[sighs]

42:18.244 --> 42:19.245
Well, I always knew.

42:19.995 --> 42:23.332
I always knew I was different,
from a pretty young age.

42:23.415 --> 42:24.458
I just didn't know how.

42:25.042 --> 42:28.587
It was hard to find out,
growing up how I did, where I did.

42:29.004 --> 42:31.966
Being a man is a particular way.

42:32.383 --> 42:33.926
So no one to ask about it.

42:34.009 --> 42:38.097
I tried things with girls pretty early on.
Nothing really ever came of anything.

42:38.180 --> 42:39.974
-Never?
-[chuckles] No.

42:40.057 --> 42:43.852
I always felt like I was, uh...
like I was playing a role or something.

42:43.936 --> 42:47.606
'Cause I wasn't feeling
what I was supposed to be feeling.

42:48.774 --> 42:51.235
Then I started feeling shit for boys.

42:52.069 --> 42:53.737
And that's how I knew. [sniffs]

42:54.488 --> 42:56.824
All right, you wanna spot me
on the heavy bag?

42:56.907 --> 42:57.783
Yeah.

43:01.579 --> 43:04.290
[Clay]  Everyone keeps trying
to put you in one box.

43:04.373 --> 43:07.626
And you fit, or you don't,
or you pretend to.

43:07.710 --> 43:10.045
But any way you look at it,
it's a fucking box.

43:11.463 --> 43:14.466
It's a fucking box,
like the box they'll bury you in.

43:17.553 --> 43:19.555
Is that why you tanked the college tour?

43:21.181 --> 43:22.558
To get out of your box?

43:24.435 --> 43:26.812
I didn't do it on purpose.   Shit happened.

43:28.063 --> 43:29.231
Just happened to you?

43:29.315 --> 43:30.816
Or did you make choices?

43:31.692 --> 43:33.319
Why'd you make those choices?

43:36.488 --> 43:38.782
-Tour was boring.
-Come on.

43:39.533 --> 43:40.951
Tell me a better story.

43:42.202 --> 43:43.412
Why'd you go upstairs?

43:43.495 --> 43:45.623
-I wanted to help that girl.
-Why you?

43:46.498 --> 43:48.792
Why did you have to be the one
to save her?

43:48.876 --> 43:52.546
Because there was another douchey
fucking guy with another beautiful girl,

43:52.630 --> 43:56.342
and I didn't...
I didn't want it to happen again.

43:56.425 --> 43:58.135
So why'd you go in the room...

43:59.261 --> 44:00.679
if she was alone in there?

44:01.847 --> 44:03.474
What were you gonna do next?

44:05.059 --> 44:06.727
-I don't know.
-You don't?

44:06.810 --> 44:09.188
Isn't that fucking scary that you don't?

44:11.357 --> 44:12.232
Yes.

44:15.110 --> 44:16.612
I was, uh...

44:19.573 --> 44:21.408
I was thinking about having sex.

44:23.911 --> 44:24.912
With the girl?

44:26.997 --> 44:27.831
No.

44:29.041 --> 44:31.043
Well, I... No, I mean... No, I don't...

44:31.293 --> 44:33.295
[sighs heavily]

44:34.505 --> 44:35.756
I wasn't thinking...

44:37.132 --> 44:38.258
about the specifics.

44:38.342 --> 44:40.678
I just saw this hot girl, and...

44:41.512 --> 44:42.513
And what?

44:46.350 --> 44:47.434
I was hard.

44:50.854 --> 44:51.855
[slaps thighs]

44:52.106 --> 44:55.317
And I didn't even realize it,
and it was fucking freaking me out.

44:55.401 --> 44:56.485
Why?

44:56.568 --> 44:59.238
-Why did it freak you out?
-I don't fucking know why.

44:59.321 --> 45:02.074
Aren't you supposed to tell me?
Isn't that your job?

45:02.157 --> 45:03.867
Is that what you think my job is?

45:03.951 --> 45:05.911
Jesus fucking Christ,
can you just tell me?

45:05.994 --> 45:10.165
I'm here because of the panic attacks
and the intrusive thoughts and everything.

45:10.249 --> 45:12.835
And aren't you supposed to help me
get rid of those?

45:13.669 --> 45:15.587
[sighs] Yes.

45:17.005 --> 45:18.215
This is the work.

45:20.759 --> 45:22.553
These are the questions we ask.

45:26.014 --> 45:27.641
[sighs in exasperation, scoffs]

45:30.394 --> 45:33.355
I just want it to get better.

45:36.442 --> 45:37.443
It can.

45:39.862 --> 45:40.863
It will.

45:42.322 --> 45:45.200
But it's not instant,
and it's not a straight line.

45:46.118 --> 45:47.369
And it may well...

45:49.371 --> 45:51.457
get worse before it gets better.

46:00.674 --> 46:02.676
I think it's brave that you joined HO.

46:03.635 --> 46:06.930
Although, I admit I was a bit surprised.

46:07.931 --> 46:09.099
I don't blame you.

46:10.434 --> 46:13.562
Most people think that I'm here
to defend who my brother is...

46:14.897 --> 46:18.066
was, or... what he did.

46:18.150 --> 46:20.778
But that's not me.

46:20.861 --> 46:22.571
-I'm not him.
-No, of course not.

46:23.614 --> 46:27.075
Must be tough trying to grieve for him,

46:28.118 --> 46:29.495
knowing what he did.

46:29.578 --> 46:31.705
I've always known that Monty had a temper.

46:32.039 --> 46:34.500
The only thing
that I don't understand is Bryce.

46:36.168 --> 46:37.377
What do you mean?

46:37.461 --> 46:39.630
Bryce was like a brother to Monty.

46:39.713 --> 46:41.757
I mean, he was even nice to me.

46:43.801 --> 46:47.221
I'm sorry, I know that Bryce
has done some really terrible--

46:47.304 --> 46:48.555
No, it's OK.

46:49.473 --> 46:53.101
He was a complicated person, I think.

46:54.228 --> 46:57.397
You used to live at his house, didn't you?

46:58.690 --> 47:00.734
In the guest house, yeah.

47:00.818 --> 47:04.404
Did you see Monty hanging around
these last few months?

47:04.988 --> 47:06.073
Um...

47:06.573 --> 47:08.283
No, not that I can remember.

47:09.493 --> 47:12.246
Well, did you see anything
that would make you think

47:12.329 --> 47:15.874
that Monty would actually want
to hurt Bryce?

47:17.459 --> 47:20.295
I never saw anything like that, no.

47:24.299 --> 47:25.467
[sniffs]

47:27.052 --> 47:30.722
[Clay]  It's just a really challenging time
for me and my friends.

47:33.684 --> 47:34.518
Hey.

47:38.063 --> 47:39.731
[groans] Thanks for meeting me.

47:41.733 --> 47:43.485
I'm surprised you actually made it.

47:44.152 --> 47:46.738
I thought you were gonna stand me up
for the third time.

47:49.074 --> 47:50.826
Yeah, I'm sorry about that.

47:50.909 --> 47:54.788
I just...
I had a lot of things... going on. [sighs]

47:56.164 --> 47:57.291
A lot of what?

47:58.542 --> 48:00.252
Driving around and drinking?

48:03.672 --> 48:05.757
Just school and shit.

48:08.135 --> 48:09.428
Zach, what's going on?

48:10.387 --> 48:11.805
This is not the way you are.

48:12.764 --> 48:14.057
What's not the way I am?

48:15.392 --> 48:17.019
Like, not showing up.

48:17.978 --> 48:19.104
Not calling.

48:20.856 --> 48:22.190
Not looking at me.

48:24.359 --> 48:25.986
[inhales shakily] Um...

48:31.992 --> 48:33.619
-Oh, Zachy.
-[sighs]

48:33.952 --> 48:35.829
-[sniffs, grunts]
-Zach, what is it?

48:38.749 --> 48:40.208
[voice catching] Shit's just...

48:41.460 --> 48:42.461
[sniffs]

48:42.544 --> 48:43.670
Shit's fucked up.

48:45.631 --> 48:46.715
What do you mean?

48:48.133 --> 48:50.761
Tell me what happened,
and we'll figure out a way to fix it.

48:50.844 --> 48:52.429
No, there's no...

48:55.015 --> 48:56.224
There's no fixing this.

48:58.977 --> 49:01.605
[Clay]  We're all just desperate
for something better.

49:03.065 --> 49:04.024
More true.

49:04.858 --> 49:07.027
Did it hurt when you did it?

49:08.570 --> 49:11.156
I'm sorry, you don't have to answer that.
That's none of my--

49:11.239 --> 49:12.532
No, it's OK.

49:13.408 --> 49:14.284
Um...

49:14.993 --> 49:15.994
I thought…

49:17.996 --> 49:20.624
[clears throat]
...I don't even know what I thought.

49:20.707 --> 49:24.002
And I never really thought
about how it'd feel, like, after.

49:24.086 --> 49:25.671
You know, how fucked up I'd be.

49:26.463 --> 49:28.966
'Cause I didn't think
there was gonna be any after.

49:29.049 --> 49:31.677
I really wish
I would've considered that possibility.

49:31.760 --> 49:33.470
I don't think you fucked up, Alex.

49:34.262 --> 49:37.140
I think it's kind of amazing, actually,
where you are now.

49:37.599 --> 49:38.767
Yeah. [chuckles]

49:39.226 --> 49:42.270
I mean, I've worked really hard
with the physical therapy and stuff.

49:42.354 --> 49:44.523
I finally got rid of that fucking cane.

49:44.940 --> 49:49.528
But... I don't know,
I'm never gonna be, like, normal again.

49:49.611 --> 49:51.113
Hey. Well, fuck normal.

49:51.822 --> 49:53.156
What does that even mean?

49:54.157 --> 49:56.493
Nobody ever actually feels normal.

49:58.078 --> 49:59.496
Yeah, I guess that's true.

49:59.579 --> 50:00.414
[chuckles]

50:00.872 --> 50:04.084
I'm sure it helps, you know,
having such a good group of friends.

50:04.292 --> 50:07.546
Tyler's always telling me you guys are so,
you know, close and everything.

50:07.754 --> 50:10.716
Yeah, we're not as close
as we used to be, but…

50:12.259 --> 50:14.011
Well, why not?

50:14.970 --> 50:18.515
I mean, you know,
they're great, and we're all great.

50:18.598 --> 50:21.268
It's just we don't hang out
as much lately.

50:23.103 --> 50:25.355
That's good news for me, I guess.
I mean...

50:27.190 --> 50:29.901
I don't really have a lot of friends
at Liberty, so...

50:31.028 --> 50:32.404
I'm really glad you called.

50:33.113 --> 50:34.406
[chuckles] Yeah, me too.

50:41.371 --> 50:42.456
-Shall we?
-[laughs]

50:46.168 --> 50:47.627
[Mrs. Jensen] Bill mentioned cameras?

50:47.711 --> 50:50.005
[Mr. Jensen]
I'm not sure how I feel about cameras.

50:50.422 --> 50:52.132
[Mrs. Jensen] Oh, hey, Clay. Uh...

50:54.134 --> 50:55.719
We were just talking about you.

50:55.927 --> 50:57.846
[suspenseful music plays]

50:59.723 --> 51:01.433
What's going on? Did something happen?

51:01.516 --> 51:04.186
No, I was just, uh,
checking in with your folks.

51:06.563 --> 51:09.024
-About what?
-Sheriff Diaz is walking us through

51:09.107 --> 51:11.318
some of the new security measures
for the school.

51:11.401 --> 51:12.527
Given all the tension lately,

51:12.611 --> 51:14.738
I wanted to make sure
your parents were aware

51:14.821 --> 51:19.409
that we're doing everything we can
to keep you and everyone else at Liberty

51:19.493 --> 51:20.952
as safe as possible.

51:21.411 --> 51:22.287
That's...

51:23.413 --> 51:24.414
That's excellent.

51:26.792 --> 51:27.834
Well, I, uh...

51:28.585 --> 51:30.212
I should probably get to work.

51:30.712 --> 51:32.214
College essays and everything.

51:44.142 --> 51:45.268
Did you see Diaz?

51:47.270 --> 51:48.105
Yeah.

51:49.856 --> 51:51.108
This isn't good, is it?

51:52.609 --> 51:53.527
No.

51:54.945 --> 51:56.071
This isn't good.

51:56.655 --> 51:58.573
[heartbeat echoes]

52:05.247 --> 52:07.249
Clay, what the fuck is wrong with you?

52:07.332 --> 52:09.334
[heart beats faster, panting]

52:10.043 --> 52:12.087
-I'm having a panic attack. [gasps]
-[thud]

from obstacles we encounter

52:22.514 --> 52:24.808

Recount a time when you faced
