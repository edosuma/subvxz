00:30.180 --> 00:31.499
What's your name?

00:33.700 --> 00:34.974
Alberto.

00:35.180 --> 00:36.408
Alberto?

00:37.060 --> 00:39.016
I've never met anyone called Alberto.

00:39.660 --> 00:41.059
What are they like?

00:41.540 --> 00:43.610
What are Albertos like?

00:44.380 --> 00:46.098
I don‘t know.

00:46.620 --> 00:49.418
They're the same as Antonios,
Ricardos,

00:49.740 --> 00:51.537
Vicentes.

00:52.380 --> 00:53.859
Vicentes. ..

00:56.300 --> 00:57.892
I've met a Vicente once.

00:58.260 --> 01:00.216
He was insane.
Insane.

01:01.700 --> 01:04.260
He told me I was the most beautiful
woman he'd ever seen.

01:05.740 --> 01:07.537
He was insane.

01:09.380 --> 01:11.450
He died young.

01:12.260 --> 01:14.615
It couldn't have been otherwise.

01:15.860 --> 01:17.293
What about me?

01:17.540 --> 01:19.292
Will I die young?

01:20.380 --> 01:23.372
- Do I look like a psychic?
- No.

01:24.700 --> 01:26.133
How about a whore?

01:27.180 --> 01:28.852
Don't we all?

01:30.140 --> 01:31.778
It depends.

01:32.420 --> 01:33.569
You don't.

01:33.980 --> 01:35.174
Don't I?

01:35.500 --> 01:37.570
So, what do I look like?

01:42.340 --> 01:43.819
You look like a poet.

01:45.340 --> 01:46.773
What do you mean?

01:48.740 --> 01:50.810
Your eyes are too sad.

01:52.220 --> 01:55.098
All men whose eyes
are too sad are poets.

02:00.980 --> 02:03.574
But you never cry, do you?

02:06.620 --> 02:09.418
The world isn't real
unless a man cries.

02:18.980 --> 02:21.255
We must watch out for sadness.

02:22.420 --> 02:24.650
It impregnates the soul.

02:24.980 --> 02:27.050
It unfolds like life.

02:29.020 --> 02:30.817
It becomes the name itself.

02:33.980 --> 02:36.016
Al Berto.

03:33.140 --> 03:35.973
A ﬁlm by

03:39.580 --> 03:43.334
Ba by baby
Let's get together

03:48.340 --> 03:52.049
And do the things
Do the things

03:53.220 --> 03:55.939
That we like to do

03:57.220 --> 03:59.370
Do a little dance

03:59.500 --> 04:01.252
Make a little love

04:01.500 --> 04:05.334
Get down tonight
Get down tonight

04:05.780 --> 04:09.773
Do a little dance
Make a little love

04:10.020 --> 04:14.377
Get down tonight
Get down tonight

04:14.620 --> 04:17.930
Baby baby
I'll meet you

04:18.899 --> 04:22.210
The same place
Same time

04:23.100 --> 04:28.094
Where we can
Get together

04:28.220 --> 04:31.815
And ease up our mind

04:31.940 --> 04:35.694
Do a little dance
Make a little love

04:36.300 --> 04:39.656
Get down tonight
Down tonight

04:40.820 --> 04:45.371
Do a little dance
Make a little love

04:45.500 --> 04:49.288
Get down tonight
Get down tonight

04:50.940 --> 04:52.089
I'm Joao, I'm from here.

04:52.820 --> 04:54.458
I went to school
with your brother Chico.

04:54.620 --> 04:57.134
Really?
I don't remember your face.

04:57.380 --> 05:00.656
That's alright,
I don't remember yours either.

05:00.900 --> 05:02.128
Shall we go?

05:02.260 --> 05:04.410
- Have you decided where to?
- Let's go to Buzio.

05:04.660 --> 05:05.615
I think I'm going to go.

05:05.740 --> 05:07.810
Come along, you'll get
to know the group!

05:11.020 --> 05:12.339
Alors, tu viens?

05:25.140 --> 05:27.859
Leonor says you came to Sines to write
a book and revolutionise the town.

05:27.980 --> 05:30.448
And that you want to be a poet.
Or was it a painter?

05:30.740 --> 05:32.298
I can't remember.

05:32.940 --> 05:34.737
I'm not good at art.
But I'd love to!

05:35.300 --> 05:36.733
You were in Brussels, weren't you?

05:36.980 --> 05:39.778
I've never left...
IfI could choose...

05:40.740 --> 05:43.937
Paris. I think the ﬁrst place
I'd visit would be Paris.

05:44.300 --> 05:47.133
I'm absolutely sure Paris would love
meeting you, Clara.

05:47.380 --> 05:50.816
- Why? What makes you say that?
- There's something Parisian about you.

05:51.780 --> 05:53.498
Me?! No...

05:53.700 --> 05:56.168
Joao Maria says I look like
Anna Karina, Godard's muse.

05:56.420 --> 05:57.409
ButI don't think so.

05:58.380 --> 06:01.053
She's beautiful...l
So is Romy Schneider.

06:01.300 --> 06:03.734
But that's a whole different story...

06:03.860 --> 06:07.170
- And we're in Sines...
- That isn't necessarily bad.

06:08.380 --> 06:10.098
Do you really think
a poet or a writer

06:10.340 --> 06:12.570
could make that much difference
in such a small town?

06:12.700 --> 06:14.850
With the right friends, sure.

06:16.580 --> 06:18.411
Clara!
Excuse me.

06:18.660 --> 06:20.378
I'm leaving.
Do you need a lift?

06:20.620 --> 06:22.770
- Right now? But it's still early!
- Are you coming?

06:23.020 --> 06:24.169
Yes, I'm coming.

06:25.420 --> 06:28.651
Well, I'd better go, my mum doesn't
want me walking home alone at night.

06:29.660 --> 06:31.412
Good night, Al Berto.

06:32.260 --> 06:34.569
- I had a lovely time.
- Good night, Clara.

06:36.660 --> 06:38.776
- See you tomorrow.
- See you!

06:40.580 --> 06:42.377
The poor thing, Joao!

06:42.500 --> 06:44.809
She'll be back, don't worry.

06:46.820 --> 06:48.731
So?
Where's Clara?

06:48.940 --> 06:50.817
- She went home.
- Alone?

06:51.060 --> 06:53.528
- No. What's his name... Ze'?
- Yes, Zé.

06:53.780 --> 06:56.897
- He left with her.
- Ah! That's better.

06:57.020 --> 07:00.057
Walking alone to Bairro das Indias
is not a good idea.

07:00.540 --> 07:01.529
So, how about you?

07:01.860 --> 07:03.054
Are you okay? Having fun?

07:03.620 --> 07:05.975
I know this isn't Bruxelles, hein!

07:06.500 --> 07:08.934
But it still helps to
take your mind off things, right?

07:10.260 --> 07:11.978
Excuse me, can I have a beer?

07:12.460 --> 07:14.178
Your friends are great!

07:15.340 --> 07:16.329
Thank you.

07:16.580 --> 07:19.140
Come, now, my love...
You shall want for nothing.

07:19.260 --> 07:21.137
Especially someone
to have a few drinks with.

07:22.340 --> 07:25.218
And these guys, they all
read and write...

07:25.340 --> 07:28.059
You'll see, you'll ﬁnd
very interesting people here.

07:28.940 --> 07:30.259
Here's to them!

07:30.900 --> 07:32.219
Thank you.

07:33.140 --> 07:34.698
Santé!

07:42.620 --> 07:44.451
You have no idea
how happy you've made me!

07:45.180 --> 07:47.535
Happiness is
overrated, Leonor.

07:48.420 --> 07:49.819
Good night.

07:50.100 --> 07:52.568
Okay, I'll think about it.

07:53.460 --> 07:54.654
- Bye!
- Take care.

07:54.780 --> 07:56.259
- Bye.
- Goodbye.

08:05.180 --> 08:07.455
Well, I'm off.

08:07.700 --> 08:10.055
- We'll walk with you.
- No, that's okay. Thanks.

08:10.700 --> 08:12.179
I enjoy walking alone.

08:12.900 --> 08:14.015
I'll be ﬁne.

08:14.300 --> 08:16.177
Iféxes'rii

09:35.700 --> 09:37.133
The door was open.

09:41.300 --> 09:43.177
The door is always open.

10:37.740 --> 10:39.617
You've got piano hands.

10:43.260 --> 10:45.137
- Piano hands?
- Yes.

10:47.900 --> 10:50.460
Your fingers are long and delicate.

10:50.780 --> 10:54.090
You need long, delicate
fingers to play the piano.

10:55.020 --> 10:59.536
Mine are... short and fat.
They're useless.

11:01.420 --> 11:03.217
I wouldn't say that.

11:04.900 --> 11:08.734
I can even give you a few examples...
of what they're good for.

11:09.020 --> 11:10.692
You bastard!

11:17.260 --> 11:19.490
Shouldn't you go home?

11:20.140 --> 11:22.370
Are you sending me away?

11:23.260 --> 11:24.818
No.

11:26.540 --> 11:30.135
I'm just not used to
spending the night with someone.

11:30.780 --> 11:32.736
That's all.

11:34.020 --> 11:35.897
Me neither.

11:37.180 --> 11:39.091
Actually, I...

11:41.020 --> 11:45.855
I had never spent the whole night
with someone...

11:47.780 --> 11:49.372
You hadn't?

11:50.380 --> 11:52.052
No.

12:31.820 --> 12:33.253
Alberto!

12:33.700 --> 12:36.168
- Ola!
- Pedro!

12:41.700 --> 12:43.452
What did I tell you?

12:43.740 --> 12:45.253
Good morning.

12:46.340 --> 12:47.568
Al Berto?

12:47.740 --> 12:49.253
Yes, that's me. How can I help you?

12:51.060 --> 12:52.778
This is my boyfriend, Miguel.

12:53.100 --> 12:56.058
The little brat is Pedro.
And I'm Manuela.

12:56.220 --> 12:57.858
- Hi.
- Hello.

12:59.100 --> 13:01.773
I'm not sure if you know Lidia,

13:02.100 --> 13:03.613
the daughter of Mrs Aliete -

13:03.820 --> 13:06.209
you know, the lady with
the eyepatch...

13:06.460 --> 13:08.655
She told us you...

13:09.660 --> 13:13.050
We've rented a house, you see,
but the landlady needs it back because

13:13.420 --> 13:15.331
her daughter's getting married...

13:15.900 --> 13:18.050
And with so many people
working at the port

13:18.180 --> 13:20.535
we seem to be a bit... at a loss.

13:20.780 --> 13:24.534
Do you need a place to stay?
That's alright. You can stay here.

13:24.820 --> 13:26.936
There's always room
for one more.

13:31.660 --> 13:32.809
Come along!

13:36.860 --> 13:39.294
But ever since I got here...

13:39.500 --> 13:40.853
it's been a nightmare.

13:41.380 --> 13:43.530
I've thought about going back,
but with the kid...

13:43.740 --> 13:47.016
Forget it! You have the same rights
as everyone else!

13:47.260 --> 13:50.013
We didn't bring anything...
Except the clothes on our back.

13:50.180 --> 13:52.535
I forgot to mention, my whole family
comes from Lourenco Marques.

13:52.700 --> 13:54.691
My parents stayed behind,
they wouldn't leave.

13:54.820 --> 13:57.015
- And now what?
- Now, nothing! It's over, isn't it?

13:58.660 --> 14:00.730
What are my two girls
talking about?

14:00.860 --> 14:02.532
- The deceased.
- Why?

14:02.660 --> 14:05.572
- We wouldn't talk about it anymore.
- Yes, but I asked...

14:05.740 --> 14:07.412
Do you know what happened
to Chico Ze'?

14:07.540 --> 14:08.495
No.

14:08.700 --> 14:10.258
Everybody's talking about it
at the fish market.

14:10.420 --> 14:12.934
- He killed himself this morning.
- Leonor didn't know...

14:13.780 --> 14:15.099
- I asked.
- Nosy!

14:15.260 --> 14:17.251
And Al Berto's house
has also been seized!

14:17.500 --> 14:20.936
They say they need the land to build a
housing development. Can you imagine?

14:21.100 --> 14:23.170
I went to a job interview
the other day.

14:23.340 --> 14:25.729
Do you know what the dick said
just as I turned my back?

14:25.980 --> 14:28.016
Go back to where you came from,
to the land of the blacks!

14:28.140 --> 14:30.017
- What did you say?
- Nothing.

14:30.180 --> 14:32.648
What they're doing
is disgraceful, let me tell you.

14:33.260 --> 14:36.809
The difference, Manuela,
is that now we can react.

14:36.940 --> 14:39.215
- Why didn't you smoke in here?
- With all this smoke?

14:39.380 --> 14:41.052
Yeah, there's too much smoke.

14:41.180 --> 14:42.454
I can't stand it, man!
I've been ill recently.

14:42.580 --> 14:43.979
- Did you know I used to smoke?
- Really?

14:44.140 --> 14:45.619
Miss Goody Two-shoes used to smoke?!

14:45.820 --> 14:48.493
It's true!
But it was a long time ago.

14:48.700 --> 14:50.179
This calls for a toast.

14:50.300 --> 14:52.734
Everybody, I'd like to propose a toast,
please raise your glasses!

14:52.900 --> 14:54.333
- Fine, let's have a toast.
- Cheers!

14:54.540 --> 14:56.212
Wait, let me say a few words.
Calm down!

14:56.340 --> 14:57.932
- Here's to you, Leonor!
- No! Wait!

14:58.180 --> 15:00.296
- To Leonor!
- Chin-chin!

15:00.740 --> 15:02.219
- Don't close your eyes!
- Don't cross your arms!

15:16.620 --> 15:18.850
It took them merely five years
to destroy the beach.

15:19.580 --> 15:23.653
They're fooling people with household
appliances and employment promises.

15:24.220 --> 15:27.769
People are so desperate
they'll believe anything.

15:27.900 --> 15:30.095
If it were me,
I'd bomb that office.

15:30.380 --> 15:31.813
Fucking fascists.

15:31.940 --> 15:33.976
Right or wrong, they pay my salary.

15:34.660 --> 15:36.173
Do you work at the complex, Duarte?

15:36.420 --> 15:37.614
I and three thousand others.

15:38.180 --> 15:41.138
This used to be very poor,
Al Berto. Very poor...

15:42.300 --> 15:43.858
You could either go to sea or emigrate.

15:44.300 --> 15:47.133
My family worked at sea their whole
life and never starved, Duarte.

15:47.500 --> 15:49.092
This is nothing.

15:49.340 --> 15:53.094
As soon as the petrochemical
discharges begin, we'll see.

15:54.060 --> 15:55.857
We put an end
to the dictatorship's poison

15:56.060 --> 15:58.369
but found another poison to kill us.

15:58.580 --> 16:00.536
But do people really want the complex?

16:01.020 --> 16:04.808
Now, Master Al Berto,
it's not a question of wanting.

16:07.220 --> 16:09.415
Money will resist anything,

16:09.580 --> 16:11.616
even revolutions.

17:20.220 --> 17:21.972
Haven't you brought anything?

17:22.660 --> 17:23.887
No.

17:25.300 --> 17:27.018
They were too big.

17:27.980 --> 17:29.572
I wasn't able to bring anything.

17:47.580 --> 17:49.172
Paint me instead.

18:58.380 --> 19:00.894
Elle est retrouvée.
Quoi?

19:02.180 --> 19:03.738
L' Eternité.

19:04.340 --> 19:07.093
C'est la mer alle'e avec le soleil.

19:07.700 --> 19:10.339
Mai 1872.

19:17.780 --> 19:20.931
You could paint Rimbaud's sun
on the living room ceiling.

19:24.980 --> 19:28.495
I could write "sun"
on the living room ceiling.

19:29.180 --> 19:30.659
Write?

19:31.740 --> 19:32.968
3:3

19:33.460 --> 19:34.575
3:3

19:34.780 --> 19:36.099
3:3

19:36.340 --> 19:37.853
Say it...

19:38.500 --> 19:40.172
Sun!

19:42.900 --> 19:44.458
You see?

19:46.660 --> 19:49.413
The word is much more radiant.

19:50.420 --> 19:51.739
Sun...

20:12.820 --> 20:14.936
I'm sorry I took off.

20:16.580 --> 20:18.650
We've missed you.

20:23.740 --> 20:26.618
"Live your eternity in each moment.

20:27.980 --> 20:29.538
"Without grief

20:29.700 --> 20:31.497
"0r yearning

20:31.980 --> 20:33.698
"Live it

20:33.820 --> 20:35.890
"Whole and strong

20:36.180 --> 20:38.569
"In frantic bravery

20:40.540 --> 20:43.418
"So that your death
may always be an ending

20:43.660 --> 20:46.333
"And never a beginning"

21:07.780 --> 21:09.179
- I don't know. Are you sure?
- Let me see.

21:09.300 --> 21:11.097
- Are you sure?
- Let me see!

21:11.300 --> 21:13.894
Except for Joao Maria
no one has ever read my stuff.

21:14.140 --> 21:15.778
It's as if they didn't exist.

21:15.940 --> 21:17.089
Nonsense!

21:17.220 --> 21:20.292
A poet can go his whole life
without publishing a book.

21:20.500 --> 21:22.855
But he'll never stop being a poet.

21:27.100 --> 21:29.250
How are you going to do this?

21:29.420 --> 21:31.536
You're taking
the books on consignment, right?

21:31.740 --> 21:35.574
What else can I do?
I hardly have enough cash flow.

21:37.620 --> 21:40.009
This will need some work.

21:42.140 --> 21:46.656
THE LAND BELONGS
TO THOSE WHO WORK IT!!

21:51.100 --> 21:53.933
I can't believe the nerve
of some people!

21:54.140 --> 21:55.698
The town is full of them, Clarinha.

21:55.860 --> 21:58.135
There aren't enough women for
all the guys working in construction.

21:58.260 --> 21:59.932
- Now, that's true!
- Why don't they bring their wives?

22:00.100 --> 22:01.419
Or get girlfriends?

22:01.580 --> 22:04.378
Sines is full of young,
beautiful girls, eager to get married.

22:04.500 --> 22:06.730
I don't think these guys
want to get married.

22:06.900 --> 22:08.652
Most of them probably already are!

22:09.180 --> 22:10.738
- Traitors!
- You're overreacting!

22:13.460 --> 22:15.690
He emigrated with his family,
he even invited you to go with him...

22:15.980 --> 22:17.413
That story again?

22:17.580 --> 22:19.059
He sent her a letter...

22:19.380 --> 22:21.291
Actually, a wedding invitation!

22:24.740 --> 22:26.856
As soon as he was gone
he got himself another girl!

22:27.020 --> 22:28.499
And a French girl at that!

22:28.700 --> 22:29.974
A French blonde!

22:30.180 --> 22:32.899
And he used to say he hated blondes.

22:33.980 --> 22:36.050
Would you ever cheat on someone, B.?

22:36.260 --> 22:37.329
Me?

22:38.020 --> 22:40.739
I don't know...
It never happened to me.

22:41.540 --> 22:42.575
- No?
- Well, I would!

22:43.540 --> 22:46.338
If it was with Raquel Welch.
Or Brigitte Bardot!

22:46.460 --> 22:48.496
Blondes, right?
Blondes!

22:49.020 --> 22:51.898
Do you think cheating changes anything?

22:54.860 --> 22:56.009
I don't know.

22:56.180 --> 22:57.579
I should ask my mum.

23:03.340 --> 23:06.855
And what about the bookshop? Will it
be named "Tanto Mar" ("All This Sea")?

23:06.980 --> 23:08.459
I like the title.

23:09.100 --> 23:11.056
It isn't a title, Duarte. It's a name.

23:31.740 --> 23:33.173
You're sleeping on the ﬂoor tonight,
Al Berto.

23:33.300 --> 23:34.653
- You're not the boss of me!
- You're not the boss of me!

23:34.940 --> 23:37.579
No, you're not the boss of me!
And now you listen to me.

23:48.860 --> 23:51.420
I need your body each and every day.

23:52.100 --> 23:56.093
Life is too short for
the desire I feel for you!

23:56.420 --> 23:58.411
If you perched on my hand

23:58.540 --> 24:01.816
you'd know that closed
it would be home,

24:01.940 --> 24:04.374
open
it would be the sky,

24:04.660 --> 24:07.094
and that you would never be alone.

24:07.340 --> 24:08.659
Bravo!

24:23.860 --> 24:25.418
Fucking fairies!

24:26.980 --> 24:29.130
- B. ,they're not worth it...
- Good evening.

24:29.420 --> 24:30.933
Beat it...

24:31.420 --> 24:33.012
before I smash your face.

24:33.220 --> 24:35.131
Fucking fairy!

24:36.060 --> 24:38.210
Do you know
where the petrol station is?

24:38.540 --> 24:40.258
Just around the corner?

24:40.740 --> 24:43.618
If you continue straight ahead
you'll see a garden.

24:43.780 --> 24:45.532
And after the garden, a house.

24:45.700 --> 24:47.133
That's where I live.

24:47.300 --> 24:49.370
The door is always open.

24:49.820 --> 24:51.970
Whenever you wish to smash my face,

24:52.300 --> 24:54.052
just drop by.

24:54.460 --> 24:56.178
Let's go!

25:09.100 --> 25:10.852
Does he usually hit him?

25:13.780 --> 25:16.010
I'm guessing this isn't the ﬁrst time.

25:17.260 --> 25:19.728
What about your father?
Did he ever hit you?

25:19.900 --> 25:21.015
No.

25:21.140 --> 25:22.493
You were lucky.

25:22.900 --> 25:26.529
He died young.
I was little.

25:27.420 --> 25:29.615
Is that right?
How did he die?

25:30.420 --> 25:32.331
In a car crash.

25:32.460 --> 25:34.735
Right, that's what they say
at the fish market.

25:36.460 --> 25:38.894
And what else do they say?

25:41.140 --> 25:42.539
Al Berto...

25:43.620 --> 25:45.611
People like change.

25:45.820 --> 25:48.254
They're very happy
with this change, but...

25:48.380 --> 25:51.452
You know some things
are better... out of sight.

25:51.660 --> 25:55.972
- You know that, right?
- No... Idon't. You tell me.

25:59.100 --> 26:01.409
You and him, of all people!

26:03.420 --> 26:06.537
Your family has always been
highly respected, and so has his.

26:06.900 --> 26:09.619
You're not a bunch of deadbeats
like my family.

26:10.340 --> 26:12.900
You know,
we didn't leave.

26:13.420 --> 26:14.933
We went to war!

26:16.700 --> 26:19.294
We don't own houses in Lisbon.

26:19.460 --> 26:21.690
We live in Bairro das Indias.

26:23.420 --> 26:26.298
Do you know why we don't dream
of being artists?

26:26.620 --> 26:28.258
Do you?

26:28.900 --> 26:31.972
Because we spend the night
at sea, afraid of dying.

26:32.140 --> 26:33.698
What are you trying to say?

26:33.820 --> 26:38.098
I'm trying to tell you to get your
things and get the hell out of here!

26:39.100 --> 26:41.216
Before something happens to you.

28:31.660 --> 28:33.139
What was that?

28:35.340 --> 28:37.695
It's the blasts at the quarry.

28:38.180 --> 28:40.136
They've started again.

28:44.460 --> 28:46.769
Get dressed.
I want to show you something.

30:00.780 --> 30:02.259
My Joao...

30:04.220 --> 30:05.812
My wind...

30:07.500 --> 30:09.331
My August.

30:12.380 --> 30:13.972
Don't be scared.

30:15.460 --> 30:17.291
I'm here.

32:04.180 --> 32:06.535
SEARCHING FOR THE WIND

32:30.660 --> 32:31.934
What is it? What's going on?

32:33.460 --> 32:34.575
Nothing.

32:34.700 --> 32:36.292
Where's Al Berto?

32:36.460 --> 32:39.213
He's taking care of some phone calls
for the publisher.

32:40.340 --> 32:42.217
Have you shown him anything?

32:42.340 --> 32:44.535
- What about?
- Your writing, Joao!

32:44.660 --> 32:46.252
I know you have
a drawer full of texts!

32:46.460 --> 32:49.133
Why won't you let him know
you also like to write?

32:50.580 --> 32:52.775
- No.
- Why not?

32:54.580 --> 32:56.218
I don't want him to think...

32:57.540 --> 33:00.816
- I'm not like you, Sara.
- No.

33:01.020 --> 33:04.251
No, you're not, Joao. And you
don't have to be here, unlike me!

33:04.540 --> 33:06.451
Because if you had to,
you'd show him your writing.

33:06.860 --> 33:08.896
What if it doesn't work out
and nobody buys anything?

33:09.020 --> 33:11.534
What are you so afraid of?
I don't get it.

33:11.980 --> 33:13.618
- Nothing, forget it. I just don't...
- What?

33:13.860 --> 33:16.738
Are you afraid he might
go back to Lisbon? Is that it?

33:17.020 --> 33:19.454
- No. That's not it, no.
- You're such a liar, Joao...

33:19.580 --> 33:20.979
What do you want?

33:21.700 --> 33:24.055
- What do you mean, what do I want?
- You heard me, what do you want?

33:29.260 --> 33:30.932
I know what I want, Joao.

33:31.060 --> 33:32.698
It may not seem like it, but I do.

33:33.020 --> 33:34.533
And if Al Berto were to tell me:

33:34.700 --> 33:37.533
"Sara, I want to publish your stuff."
What's the harm?

33:37.860 --> 33:39.452
Tell me, what's the big deal?

33:41.380 --> 33:43.940
If a miracle doesn't happen
I'll end up here.

33:44.460 --> 33:46.928
Like my parents and
grandparents.

33:48.660 --> 33:51.094
I don't want to spend
the rest of my life here.

33:54.900 --> 33:59.610
And you, Joao,
you'd better start living yours.

34:22.340 --> 34:24.058
"Tanto Mar" - "All This Sea".

34:25.340 --> 34:26.773
The bookshop.

34:50.380 --> 34:51.859
Finally!

34:54.500 --> 34:57.253
- How long haveI been asleep?
- Two or three hours.

34:57.420 --> 34:58.694
Are you hungry?

34:58.940 --> 34:59.975
No.

35:04.060 --> 35:07.018
B., can I ask you something?

35:08.380 --> 35:10.177
Sure, go ahead.

35:12.260 --> 35:15.730
Have you...
Have you ever been with a woman?

35:23.100 --> 35:25.091
Ah Clarinha, Clarinha...

35:25.700 --> 35:26.894
Yes.

35:27.980 --> 35:29.652
I've been with women.

35:29.780 --> 35:31.054
Why?

35:32.740 --> 35:35.618
You're not going to tell me
you're in love with me.

35:41.780 --> 35:43.657
You're so handsome...

35:46.420 --> 35:48.570
So inspiring...

35:48.940 --> 35:50.896
Brave.

35:51.100 --> 35:54.729
Boys here...
They're not like you.

35:55.340 --> 35:56.932
They lack...

35:57.060 --> 35:58.618
Sparkle.

35:59.100 --> 36:01.568
They lack sparkle in their eyes.

36:03.260 --> 36:05.649
I'm not sure
I'm all that.

36:05.860 --> 36:08.090
- But thank you.
- You are.

36:08.300 --> 36:10.575
Joao Maria is a lucky man.

36:10.740 --> 36:13.857
I hope one day I'll find
a man like you. But I doubt it.

36:14.540 --> 36:16.212
I'll likely end up like Leonor.

36:16.380 --> 36:20.373
A spinster at thirty.
A teacher, all alone.

36:21.220 --> 36:24.530
I don't believe it.
One day he'll come along.

36:25.180 --> 36:28.297
And I trust Leonor has a boyfriend
in Alcochete, you can bet!

36:28.740 --> 36:30.173
Hum... I doubt it!

36:31.220 --> 36:34.098
And those women you've been with,
was that in Brussels?

36:36.900 --> 36:38.049
Yes.

36:41.980 --> 36:43.777
And why did it end?

36:47.460 --> 36:49.416
She left.

36:51.980 --> 36:54.289
She packed her bags and left.

36:57.340 --> 36:59.570
Is that why you came back?

37:00.420 --> 37:02.012
No.

37:03.740 --> 37:05.810
I came back...

37:06.860 --> 37:10.455
Because I think I ﬁgured out there
what I wanted to be here.

37:11.500 --> 37:14.333
Because it was time to come back home.

37:15.140 --> 37:16.334
Right.

37:16.540 --> 37:18.735
Maybe that's what I'll have to do.

37:19.300 --> 37:20.619
What?

37:20.780 --> 37:22.611
Leave.

37:24.300 --> 37:26.336
Why don't you?

37:29.380 --> 37:31.450
Because I'm scared.

38:37.980 --> 38:40.369
I never wanted to see you
through your eyes

38:40.500 --> 38:43.060
for I believed you were
the way I saw you.

38:43.700 --> 38:46.009
I never wanted to be
what you desired

38:46.300 --> 38:48.973
for I believed you were
the way I desired.

38:49.140 --> 38:51.415
And I never said
what you heard

38:51.620 --> 38:55.329
forI lived hoping to hear you say
what you never did.

38:58.460 --> 39:00.212
That's beautiful!

39:01.660 --> 39:04.493
- Now you, Al Berto!
- No. Not yet.

39:04.620 --> 39:06.451
When the book's
closer to being finished

39:06.580 --> 39:09.048
I promise to do a session at the house
and I'll read it cover to cover.

39:09.260 --> 39:11.091
- Promise.
- Okay. It's a promise.

39:12.420 --> 39:14.775
And how about you, Joao Maria,
why don't you read us something?

39:14.940 --> 39:17.135
- No, I haven't brought anything.
- You are such a liar!

39:18.500 --> 39:20.297
- He brought something.
- Joao...

39:20.740 --> 39:22.492
- Read!
- Come on.

39:42.460 --> 39:43.939
This will do.

39:58.660 --> 40:00.696
When dawn broke

40:00.820 --> 40:03.698
I laid my naked breast
over your breast

40:04.220 --> 40:05.573
I was trembling

40:05.700 --> 40:07.258
my face was pale

40:07.380 --> 40:09.132
my hands were cold

40:09.260 --> 40:12.491
and the agony of return
now dwelled in my eyes

40:13.220 --> 40:15.893
I wanted to kiss you
with a vague thankful caress

40:16.100 --> 40:18.534
but as my lips
touched your lips

40:18.700 --> 40:21.453
I realised death
was already in me

40:21.700 --> 40:23.611
and thatI had to flee

40:24.380 --> 40:26.257
so I wouldn't miss a single moment

40:26.420 --> 40:29.537
in which I was
the true absence of sorrow

40:30.380 --> 40:32.974
and you were true serenity

40:44.580 --> 40:45.979
To Joao!

40:46.300 --> 40:47.699
To Joao.

41:48.060 --> 41:50.096
I'm very curious about
one author.

41:50.260 --> 41:53.058
He brought... He's bringing
all kinds of different things.

41:53.180 --> 41:55.455
- Yes, I can see that.
- Ah! Bob Dylan!

41:55.700 --> 41:57.338
I love him!

41:57.780 --> 42:00.294
he wrote some songs about...

42:00.620 --> 42:02.929
Yeah, but Bob Dylan is my favourite.

42:03.060 --> 42:05.620
- For me, he could win the Nobel Prize.
- The Nobel Prize in Music?

42:05.900 --> 42:07.777
- Isn't there one?
- No!

42:08.140 --> 42:10.017
- How are you?
- I'm great!

42:11.380 --> 42:14.213
I think it's terrific.
The decoration is so simple...

42:14.660 --> 42:17.015
Sines deserved a bookshop
like this...

42:17.260 --> 42:20.297
There are foreign books,
even a French book.

42:44.620 --> 42:46.497
What the hell are you doing here?

42:46.900 --> 42:49.016
Haven't you had enough?
Hadn't you left?

42:51.540 --> 42:53.690
Get out! Get the hell out! Now!

42:53.940 --> 42:55.453
- Did you hear me?
- Stop it! Please.

42:55.660 --> 42:58.094
- Are you out of your mind, Joao? Stop!
- She knows damn well. Fucking whore!

42:58.260 --> 42:59.613
- Stop it!
- Get out!

43:03.100 --> 43:04.499
Out!

43:30.700 --> 43:31.894
It looks terrific!

43:43.540 --> 43:44.768
Salope!

43:49.980 --> 43:52.335
- Why haven't you called?
- What are you doing here?

43:52.500 --> 43:54.855
I had enough of the old lady,
I couldn't put up with her anymore!

43:55.940 --> 44:00.650
And you! Living like a king in this
palace and keeping it all to yourself!

44:00.820 --> 44:03.414
When I told you I was coming to Sines
you rolled your eyes at me!

44:03.660 --> 44:05.298
Liar. I did not!

44:08.500 --> 44:10.456
Ca c'est super, mon amour!

44:13.740 --> 44:15.378
Ah! And there's alcohol too!

44:15.700 --> 44:18.055
What? Beer?! Really?

44:18.180 --> 44:19.772
You know I hate beer...

44:19.980 --> 44:21.379
Is there any whisky?

44:21.580 --> 44:22.649
Here!

44:34.700 --> 44:36.577
Did you put that in your mouth, chéri?

44:36.740 --> 44:38.298
Yeah, why?

44:40.140 --> 44:42.176
You don't have any oral infections,
do you?

44:42.380 --> 44:43.779
It's just that...

44:44.020 --> 44:46.170
- I have such sensitive lips!
- No.

44:48.220 --> 44:49.414
Oral infections, no...

44:49.540 --> 44:53.010
- Only dirty words.
- Ouch!

44:53.460 --> 44:55.178
I love it!

44:55.300 --> 44:57.177
I love dirty words...

44:57.340 --> 45:00.059
Especially when they look like this,

45:00.540 --> 45:02.019
big.

45:02.900 --> 45:04.731
blue-eyed,

45:05.540 --> 45:07.098
bearded...

45:11.700 --> 45:13.770
- Give him a kiss, Dudu!
- Shut up!

45:14.260 --> 45:15.932
You give me a kiss!

45:16.260 --> 45:18.854
- I'm coming, hot stuff, I'm coming!
- Who's that guy?

45:18.980 --> 45:20.811
He's a friend from Brussels,
I'll explain later.

45:21.940 --> 45:23.851
Hum... 15 he going to stay here?

45:24.060 --> 45:26.210
Yes... Why?

45:26.380 --> 45:27.813
Is there a problem?

45:28.820 --> 45:30.776
I don't like the way he looks.

45:31.300 --> 45:33.609
Are you afraid he might steal
something from you?

45:33.780 --> 45:35.259
Tell me...

45:51.060 --> 45:52.095
Where are you going?

45:52.260 --> 45:54.012
I'm meeting Joao Maria and Leonor.

45:54.140 --> 45:55.858
Then don't bother coming home!

45:55.980 --> 45:57.129
What?

45:57.540 --> 45:58.814
You heard me!

45:59.020 --> 46:01.136
If you're going to meet those people,
don't bother coming home tonight.

46:01.300 --> 46:03.530
Look...
If that's what you want, I won't.

46:03.780 --> 46:06.692
Have you no shame?
People are talking all over town!

46:06.820 --> 46:08.856
If your father was alive...
you'd break his heart!

46:09.020 --> 46:11.534
If my father was alive
he'd be very proud of me!

46:12.460 --> 46:15.099
Don't play coy with me!

46:15.540 --> 46:18.134
People know damn well what's going on
in that house, you hear me?

46:18.260 --> 46:20.216
Who do you think you are?
You think you're one of them?

46:20.420 --> 46:22.251
You're a ﬁsherman's daughter!
Don't fool yourself!

46:22.380 --> 46:24.530
You can't afford to behave like them.

46:24.700 --> 46:26.816
They've got their mummies and daddies
to protect them.

46:26.940 --> 46:28.498
They're privileged.
You're not!

46:29.180 --> 46:31.899
Can't you see they're having fun
at your expense?

46:33.100 --> 46:34.977
If you won't do it for me, at least do
it for your father, God rest his soul.

46:35.140 --> 46:37.813
My father?! My father fought very hard
for this country to be free!

46:38.060 --> 46:40.096
He suffered a great deal. He was
arrested, he did everything he could

46:40.220 --> 46:42.051
so I wouldn't end up here,
like he did!

46:42.260 --> 46:44.410
Don't you dare compare yourself
to your father, you hear me?

46:44.540 --> 46:46.212
You're a woman! Don't be ridiculous!

46:46.380 --> 46:49.531
If it's ridiculous to you,
I'm really sorry,

46:49.660 --> 46:52.857
but I won't stop living my life just
because of what others think of me.

46:53.180 --> 46:54.135
What about me?

46:54.300 --> 46:56.211
Don't you care about what I think?

46:56.340 --> 46:57.739
At all?!

47:38.020 --> 47:41.649
blessed is the fruit of thy womb,
Jesus.

47:41.820 --> 47:45.051
Holy Mary, Mother of God,
pray for us sinners,

47:45.300 --> 47:48.656
now and at the hour of our death. Amen.

47:48.820 --> 47:51.971
Hail Mary, full of grace
The Lord is with thee

47:52.340 --> 47:54.808
Blessed art thou amongst women...

48:01.380 --> 48:03.450
Oh, what a shame...!
We're too late.

48:03.820 --> 48:04.969
Yeah...

48:05.180 --> 48:06.852
We should have come sooner.

48:07.220 --> 48:09.973
- Maybe there's a matinee on Sunday!
- Yeah, maybe.

48:10.100 --> 48:12.136
It says today was the last day.

48:12.420 --> 48:13.569
Oh well...

48:13.700 --> 48:15.019
We'll come back next year!

48:15.140 --> 48:16.334
Pedro...

48:16.460 --> 48:18.496
- Would you like to see the circus?
- I'd like to see it too.

48:18.620 --> 48:21.088
Uncle Al Berto is going to fix this,
okay?

48:31.540 --> 48:32.973
Good evening!

48:34.580 --> 48:36.013
Good evening.

48:36.460 --> 48:39.020
I'd like to talk to
the person in charge.

48:39.460 --> 48:40.973
That'll be me.

48:41.780 --> 48:43.133
How can I help you?

48:43.300 --> 48:46.053
- I have an invitation for you.
- An invitation?

52:18.740 --> 52:22.699
FAIRIES OUT!

52:50.940 --> 52:53.579
Who did this, Leandrinho?

52:55.620 --> 52:58.214
- I don't know.
- You do.

53:01.460 --> 53:03.894
You know, but you won't tell me.

53:07.300 --> 53:08.858
I can't.

53:09.300 --> 53:11.018
Why?

53:11.780 --> 53:14.453
Because you don't want to know.

53:23.100 --> 53:25.375
Was it someone in the house?

53:27.580 --> 53:29.172
No.

53:29.900 --> 53:32.733
It was the whole town, Master Al Berto.

53:33.660 --> 53:35.571
People are talking.

53:36.500 --> 53:37.899
And you know...

53:38.020 --> 53:40.898
when people talk...
- They don't know what they say.

53:46.420 --> 53:48.138
You're right, they don't.

53:48.900 --> 53:51.858
But now they're free
to speak their mind.

53:52.140 --> 53:53.619
- Hello!
- Good afternoon!

53:53.820 --> 53:55.253
- Welcome!
- Thank you.

53:55.460 --> 53:57.018
I've invited all the parents
from Pedro's school,

53:57.180 --> 53:59.216
and Miguel's brought
his buddies from the factory.

53:59.540 --> 54:01.770
Hello, good afternoon!

54:01.900 --> 54:03.219
They wanted whores and fairies,

54:03.460 --> 54:06.657
they're getting Cam6es,
Florbela, Baudelaire, Sophia!

54:06.900 --> 54:08.731
Al Berto, only you
would say something like that!

54:08.860 --> 54:10.657
- Yeah, right!
- I'd like to introduce you Candinha.

54:10.980 --> 54:13.255
- What a beauty, Duarte!
- Thank you!

54:13.420 --> 54:14.535
- Hello!
- Hello.

54:15.180 --> 54:17.774
- Pleasure.
- Thank you so much for inviting us.

54:17.940 --> 54:21.057
Duarte told me there'd be poetry
and I love poetry,

54:21.220 --> 54:22.972
but I apologise
for dressing like this,

54:23.140 --> 54:24.778
I'm on holiday
and didn't have time to...

54:24.900 --> 54:28.370
That's alright, dear.
Poetry doesn't have a dress code yet.

54:28.540 --> 54:30.929
Better than dressing properly to
read it, you should read it in bed...

54:31.060 --> 54:32.732
naked!
- That's what I keep telling her!

54:32.860 --> 54:34.259
Shut up!

54:34.380 --> 54:35.893
Enjoy. Later!

54:38.860 --> 54:40.259
Hi.
Good afternoon.

54:42.180 --> 54:44.489
Welcome!
Good afternoon!

54:46.500 --> 54:49.412
It is a great honour welcoming you here

54:49.580 --> 54:51.571
to our ﬁrst poetry recital

54:51.780 --> 54:53.657
in Maison Pidwell.

54:54.460 --> 55:00.217
Our programme today includes
some of the most distinguished

55:00.380 --> 55:02.416
figures of international poetry.

55:02.580 --> 55:05.811
I'd like to start with reciting
a poem from the heart

55:06.060 --> 55:08.051
by George Sand.

55:08.540 --> 55:09.575
Here goes.

55:13.700 --> 55:16.260
La nature est
Tout ce qu'on voit

55:16.900 --> 55:18.697
Tout ce qu'on veut

55:18.820 --> 55:20.492
Tout ce qu'on aime

55:21.140 --> 55:23.290
Tout ce qu'on sait
Tout ce qu'on croit

55:23.700 --> 55:26.294
Tout ce que I'on sent
En soi-méme

55:26.660 --> 55:28.616
Elle est belle
A qui Ia voit

55:28.740 --> 55:31.573
‘Elle est bonne
A celui qui I'aime

55:31.900 --> 55:34.095
Elle est juste
Quand on y croit

55:34.900 --> 55:37.414
Et qu'on Ia respecte
En soi-méme

55:38.220 --> 55:40.051
Regarde Ie ciel

55:40.420 --> 55:42.012
II te voit

55:42.460 --> 55:44.928
Embrasse Ia terre
Elle t'aime

55:47.300 --> 55:48.892
La vérité

55:49.020 --> 55:50.692
C'est ce qu'on croit

55:50.820 --> 55:52.014
En la nature

55:52.140 --> 55:53.892
C'est toi-méme

55:56.100 --> 55:57.772
Bravo!

55:58.660 --> 55:59.979
Thank you!

56:00.300 --> 56:01.892
Thank you so much! Thank you!

56:02.340 --> 56:04.934
Merci! Merci!
Thank you!

56:05.140 --> 56:08.212
And now we shall continue with...

56:09.620 --> 56:10.848
the complete reading

56:11.060 --> 56:13.051
of The Lusiads. It shouldn't take long!

56:14.180 --> 56:17.172
Thank you so much!
What a wonderful soirée!

56:17.380 --> 56:19.177
Seriously! I never would've guessed.

56:19.340 --> 56:21.649
Your mother would be
very proud, Al Berto.

56:21.780 --> 56:23.975
- Thank you so much for coming.
- Don't mention it!

56:24.260 --> 56:25.739
The palace is absolutely gorgeous!

56:25.900 --> 56:28.778
I'd never been here.
Only imagined what it would be like.

56:28.900 --> 56:30.253
It's gorgeous! Gorgeous.

56:30.420 --> 56:32.490
You're very welcome here.

56:32.660 --> 56:34.651
It's a shame the house
isn't yours anymore.

56:34.940 --> 56:37.329
Your family must be devastated.

56:37.540 --> 56:40.373
But, if you need anything,
don't hesitate. You can count on us.

56:40.540 --> 56:41.575
Can I?

56:41.780 --> 56:45.455
Then tell your lady friends that
we don't eat children for breakfast.

56:46.580 --> 56:47.649
Good afternoon.

56:47.780 --> 56:49.179
- Good afternoon.
- God bless.

56:50.140 --> 56:51.539
Good afternoon.

56:55.300 --> 56:58.133
I bet the husband will drop by later
tonight saying he forgot something!

56:58.700 --> 57:01.055
- Hey, sorw! Excuse me.
- Yes?

57:01.220 --> 57:02.812
Is this a hotel or something?

57:02.980 --> 57:06.814
- Depends... What you are looking for!
- Maria...

57:07.020 --> 57:09.329
What can we do for you guys?

57:23.660 --> 57:28.211
J' habite seul avec maman
Dans un trés vieil appartement

57:28.500 --> 57:30.570
Rue Sarasate

57:31.180 --> 57:35.856
J'ai pour me tenir compagnie
Une tortue, deux canaris

57:36.220 --> 57:38.256
Et urre chatte

57:39.260 --> 57:43.890
Pour Iaisser maman reposer
Trés souventje fais Ie marche'

57:44.180 --> 57:46.569
Et Ia cuisine

57:47.180 --> 57:49.694
Je range, je lave
J'essuie

57:49.860 --> 57:54.376
A I'occasion je pique aussi
A la machine

57:55.100 --> 57:57.489
Le travail ne me fait pas
Peur

57:57.980 --> 58:02.098
Je suis un peu décorateur
Un peu styliste

58:02.860 --> 58:05.294
Mais mon vrai métier
C'est la nuit

58:05.540 --> 58:09.579
Or) je I'exerce, travesti
Je suis artiste

58:10.700 --> 58:13.658
J'ai un numéro trés spécial

58:13.820 --> 58:17.813
Qui ﬁnit en nu inte'gral
Aprés strip-tease

58:18.900 --> 58:21.368
Et dans la salle
Je vois que

58:21.540 --> 58:23.417
Les males n'en croient pas
Leurs yeux

58:23.620 --> 58:25.212
Je suis un homo

58:25.420 --> 58:27.058
Comme ils disent

58:28.820 --> 58:32.051
A I'heure ou naft
Un jour nouveau

58:32.340 --> 58:33.455
- What's up?
- Hey...

58:34.860 --> 58:36.179
Why aren't you dancing?

58:36.740 --> 58:37.775
No...

58:39.700 --> 58:41.497
Unless you want to.

58:46.540 --> 58:48.929
Why have I never
seen you with a boyfriend?

58:54.620 --> 58:56.497
Because I've never had one.

58:58.900 --> 59:01.289
Would you like to?

59:05.300 --> 59:07.734
I don't think about it anymore.

59:10.700 --> 59:12.656
- Come on.
- Huh?

59:12.780 --> 59:14.657
- Come on.
- Please don't...

59:18.460 --> 59:23.375
N'a pas [6 draft en vérité
De me blamer, de me juger

59:23.740 --> 59:25.253
Etje précise

59:26.620 --> 59:29.009
Qui sait bien la nature qui

59:29.940 --> 59:32.329
Et Ie seul responsable ici

59:34.220 --> 59:36.097
Je suis un homo

59:37.300 --> 59:39.689
Comme ils disent

01:00:08.900 --> 01:00:11.050
You won't see me crying tonight.

01:00:11.420 --> 01:00:13.138
Al Berto.

01:00:13.780 --> 01:00:16.499
Your name contains
a huge abyss.

01:00:18.180 --> 01:00:20.978
This house is just the first plunge.

01:00:21.260 --> 01:00:24.491
Others will come...
Ever darker,

01:00:24.660 --> 01:00:27.128
lonelier, truer.

01:00:31.140 --> 01:00:35.816
You must experience it all, so then
you'll want nothing but to write.

01:00:39.980 --> 01:00:43.177
I gather this is a town of poets.

01:00:43.340 --> 01:00:44.932
No, it isn't.

01:00:45.580 --> 01:00:48.458
It's you who illuminates people.

01:00:48.820 --> 01:00:51.095
You see what's inside.

01:00:51.380 --> 01:00:54.133
You see things
they can't even imagine...

01:00:54.620 --> 01:00:56.690
But that's not your job.

01:00:58.740 --> 01:01:01.174
This world is doomed, Al Berto.

01:01:03.060 --> 01:01:04.539
We're all doomed.

01:01:06.340 --> 01:01:09.298
We'll all end up dying alone.

01:04:07.420 --> 01:04:09.456
What the hell are you doing here?

01:04:11.260 --> 01:04:12.818
Get out.

01:04:15.300 --> 01:04:16.699
- Get out!
- Stop it, Al Berto!

01:04:16.820 --> 01:04:18.936
You think I didn't see you?
What have you been doing till now?

01:04:19.140 --> 01:04:22.177
- You pig!
- Stop it, Al Berto! Stop!

01:04:22.380 --> 01:04:24.052
- Traitor!
- Stop it!

01:04:24.260 --> 01:04:26.091
- Al Berto, what's going on?
- Get the hell out!

01:04:26.860 --> 01:04:28.737
Do you think I deserve this?
Look at it!

01:04:28.940 --> 01:04:30.168
- Look!
- Stop it, Al Berto.

01:04:30.300 --> 01:04:31.699
- Why, Joao? Tell me!
- Let's talk.

01:04:31.860 --> 01:04:33.088
Do you think I deserve it?

01:04:33.260 --> 01:04:34.693
- I don't deserve this!
- Stop it!

01:04:34.860 --> 01:04:36.213
Stop it, both of you!

01:04:36.380 --> 01:04:38.416
You're crazy and you're sick!

01:04:38.580 --> 01:04:39.615
Sick!

01:04:39.740 --> 01:04:41.219
Cut it out,
I didn't do anything!

01:04:41.340 --> 01:04:42.295
I knew it.

01:04:42.460 --> 01:04:44.815
I knew it!
All that talk...

01:04:45.180 --> 01:04:46.738
and you're just
like your fucking father!

01:04:46.860 --> 01:04:48.452
That's it, stop it!

01:05:16.100 --> 01:05:18.011
I hate you!

01:05:27.540 --> 01:05:29.531
- Come on, it'll be good for you.
- Manuela, I don't want it!

01:05:29.700 --> 01:05:31.133
Manuela, please go.

01:05:59.940 --> 01:06:01.817
Don't you want me to call him?

01:06:02.140 --> 01:06:03.209
No.

01:06:04.740 --> 01:06:06.378
It's better this way.

01:06:07.140 --> 01:06:09.859
Sooner or later everything ends.

01:06:10.060 --> 01:06:11.778
But he loves you...

01:06:13.820 --> 01:06:15.731
I know he does, Al Berto.

01:06:15.940 --> 01:06:17.851
He was drunk, that's all.

01:06:17.980 --> 01:06:19.254
I saw him, Duarte!

01:06:22.620 --> 01:06:24.053
I saw him...

01:06:25.140 --> 01:06:27.335
I've known Joao since we were kids.

01:06:27.540 --> 01:06:30.100
I know he wouldn't do
something like that.

01:06:30.460 --> 01:06:33.179
On top of everything
that's going on in his house?!

01:06:35.740 --> 01:06:36.889
Come on.

01:06:37.100 --> 01:06:38.692
At least talk to him.

01:06:39.340 --> 01:06:40.773
What for?

01:06:41.300 --> 01:06:43.256
Will it change anything?

01:06:43.380 --> 01:06:45.257
If you love him, it will.

01:06:46.420 --> 01:06:49.093
And it may even change
something in him.

01:06:55.220 --> 01:06:58.337
Aren't you supposed to feel lost
when you're in love?

01:07:37.740 --> 01:07:40.971
"Des humains suffrages

"enﬁn".

01:08:05.740 --> 01:08:07.890
Would you ever cheat on someone, B.?

01:08:09.780 --> 01:08:12.214
I don't know...
It never happened to me.

01:08:22.899 --> 01:08:25.130
-"La‘ pas d'espérance"

I'd like a whisky.

I've already told you
we've got nothing of the sort!

01:10:02.940 --> 01:10:03.975
Those are my things!

01:10:04.100 --> 01:10:06.660
Do you have a warrant
to search the house, ofﬁcer?

01:10:06.900 --> 01:10:08.333
Those are my son's!

01:10:11.620 --> 01:10:12.575
Mr Al Berto...

01:10:12.700 --> 01:10:15.339
Mr Al Berto is not the owner
of this property, madam.

01:10:15.500 --> 01:10:16.933
This is an illegal occupation.

01:10:17.100 --> 01:10:19.534
And sooner or later you will get
an eviction order.

01:10:19.660 --> 01:10:22.857
How can you do something like this,
in the middle of the night?

01:10:25.300 --> 01:10:26.415
Run, Zé!

01:10:26.660 --> 01:10:29.618
Zé, where are you going, man?
Come here!

01:10:29.740 --> 01:10:30.855
No!

01:10:31.180 --> 01:10:32.579
- No! No. Zé!
- I'm sorry!

01:10:32.700 --> 01:10:34.099
‘- Zé!
- I m sorry!

01:10:35.860 --> 01:10:37.657
- I'm sorry!
- No...

01:10:37.820 --> 01:10:39.333
We are good people.

01:10:39.540 --> 01:10:42.259
And until proven otherwise
you have no right to say these things.

01:10:42.420 --> 01:10:43.773
Let me go!

01:11:06.620 --> 01:11:08.576
You'll hear from us soon.

01:11:19.620 --> 01:11:21.531
It's alright, sweetheart.

01:11:21.860 --> 01:11:22.975
It's over.

01:11:40.580 --> 01:11:44.255
I failed yet again in providing
a home for my son.

01:11:46.460 --> 01:11:48.849
Sooner or later they'll send us away...

01:11:50.460 --> 01:11:52.610
And we've got nowhere to go.

01:11:58.180 --> 01:11:59.932
I'm sorry.

01:12:05.980 --> 01:12:07.857
I truly am.

01:12:19.900 --> 01:12:23.210
Your future is at stake here.
Those people aren't good for anyone.

01:12:23.340 --> 01:12:25.092
- That's not true.
- You're going to your aunt's.

01:12:25.260 --> 01:12:27.615
You'll be alright there.
You'll be safe...

01:12:27.820 --> 01:12:29.811
And you can apply yourself to
your books... You'll be focused, love.

01:12:30.260 --> 01:12:33.013
Those people aren't good for you.
Child. . . !

01:12:33.460 --> 01:12:36.020
I don't want to go, Sara...
I don't want to go.

01:12:36.140 --> 01:12:37.289
Let's go, Clara!

01:12:37.420 --> 01:12:38.773
- Clara, let's go!
- I don't want to go...

01:12:38.980 --> 01:12:40.936
Clara, you are going to Lisbon
and that's ﬁnal!

01:14:13.300 --> 01:14:15.450
If you're looking for your son
I don't know where he is.

01:14:15.620 --> 01:14:16.655
No...

01:14:16.780 --> 01:14:19.169
I came to see you.

01:14:32.500 --> 01:14:34.650
Jorge de Sena.

01:14:37.300 --> 01:14:39.894
Poetry, poetry...

01:14:41.100 --> 01:14:44.536
Do you really think this is
what people need?

01:14:44.660 --> 01:14:45.934
Books?

01:14:47.060 --> 01:14:49.290
IfI didn't, I wouldn't have
opened the door.

01:14:49.500 --> 01:14:51.775
I wouldn't have come back to Sines...

01:14:55.620 --> 01:14:57.372
You know what, Al Berto?

01:14:57.620 --> 01:14:59.451
People starved for many years.

01:14:59.660 --> 01:15:00.888
They starved.

01:15:01.180 --> 01:15:03.933
And then too many sons
died in the war.

01:15:04.060 --> 01:15:05.698
I was lucky, mine came back.

01:15:05.820 --> 01:15:07.776
But some weren't that lucky.

01:15:09.060 --> 01:15:11.290
The war is over, Mr Vicente.

01:15:12.020 --> 01:15:13.692
The country is free.

01:15:14.340 --> 01:15:17.059
There are plenty of jobs at the
complex. What seems to be the problem?

01:15:18.620 --> 01:15:21.259
You know damn well
what the problem is.

01:15:21.460 --> 01:15:22.939
Custédio's son was arrested!

01:15:23.060 --> 01:15:25.051
They found drugs at the Palace.

01:15:25.380 --> 01:15:27.769
And everyone knows, the parties...

01:15:28.380 --> 01:15:30.257
Everyone talks about it...

01:15:30.740 --> 01:15:32.810
The way you people live...

01:15:33.220 --> 01:15:35.688
I don't care about what they say.

01:15:35.980 --> 01:15:38.255
I only care about what you think.

01:15:39.820 --> 01:15:41.651
Is it because
your son and I are together?

01:15:41.820 --> 01:15:43.412
Don't be ridiculous!

01:15:44.020 --> 01:15:47.808
You people don't understand anything!
You don't understand life!

01:15:48.740 --> 01:15:51.049
And who do we need approval from?

01:15:51.220 --> 01:15:52.369
You?

01:15:52.500 --> 01:15:54.218
The party? The town?

01:15:54.820 --> 01:15:57.618
Wasn't that supposed to have ended
with the dictatorship?

01:15:58.100 --> 01:16:00.568
What have we been doing
that is so terrible?

01:16:10.420 --> 01:16:12.376
Just remember one thing.

01:16:12.660 --> 01:16:14.093
You have somewhere to go

01:16:14.300 --> 01:16:16.530
once you get tired of all this shit...

01:16:16.700 --> 01:16:18.452
You have somewhere to go!

01:16:18.620 --> 01:16:20.497
Joao Maria doesn't.

01:16:20.660 --> 01:16:23.220
Joao Maria... doesn't.

01:17:07.700 --> 01:17:09.338
Promise me.

01:17:09.780 --> 01:17:11.179
What?

01:17:13.980 --> 01:17:16.574
Promise you'll never leave me.

01:17:17.700 --> 01:17:19.452
I promise.

01:18:02.940 --> 01:18:03.895
Al Berto!

01:18:04.060 --> 01:18:05.379
- Joao Maria!
- What is it?

01:18:05.580 --> 01:18:06.979
- Look!
- What's going on?

01:18:08.820 --> 01:18:10.890
- What the fuck's going on?
- Come down here!

01:18:11.220 --> 01:18:13.450
Open the door!

01:18:14.020 --> 01:18:15.692
Get the hell out of here!

01:18:20.580 --> 01:18:22.696
Manuela, bring the kid downstairs.
It's safer.

01:18:27.620 --> 01:18:29.019
What was that?

01:18:38.780 --> 01:18:40.372
Al Berto, the door isn't locked!

01:18:41.220 --> 01:18:43.017
- Stop it!
- Joao!

01:18:43.220 --> 01:18:44.369
Miguel!

01:18:47.060 --> 01:18:49.494
Master Al Berto, they're coming in
through the kitchen!

01:18:50.140 --> 01:18:51.778
Miguel, go get Pedro!

01:18:52.420 --> 01:18:55.139
- What do I do?
- Call the police, quickly.

01:18:55.340 --> 01:18:56.534
Leandrinho, help me!

01:18:57.340 --> 01:18:58.614
Stop!

01:18:59.860 --> 01:19:01.088
Go away!

01:19:01.260 --> 01:19:04.058
- Leave us alone!
- Master Al Berto!

01:19:04.820 --> 01:19:07.050
Move, move!
I'm going to handle this!

01:19:07.980 --> 01:19:08.935
What do you want?

01:19:09.140 --> 01:19:10.858
You have eight days
to leave this house!

01:19:11.020 --> 01:19:12.692
Or we'll be back!

01:19:13.220 --> 01:19:14.573
Leave!

01:19:15.220 --> 01:19:17.939
If anything happens to my son I swear
I'll kill each and every one of you!

01:19:18.100 --> 01:19:20.534
You hear me?
I'll kill you with my bare hands!

01:19:23.820 --> 01:19:25.299
Can you tell us what's going on?

01:19:25.460 --> 01:19:26.779
I don't know...

01:19:26.980 --> 01:19:30.575
You let those who could've answered
get away, officer!

01:19:30.700 --> 01:19:31.974
Why don't you go after them?

01:19:32.100 --> 01:19:35.410
Because I'm asking you,
Mr Alberto Pidwell Tavares.

01:19:35.540 --> 01:19:37.258
What's happened to the lights?

01:19:37.460 --> 01:19:39.337
How long have you been
living here?

01:19:39.460 --> 01:19:40.529
Two years.

01:19:40.700 --> 01:19:42.770
You're aware that
this property has been seized.

01:19:43.780 --> 01:19:45.498
As has half the town...

01:19:45.700 --> 01:19:48.658
All our properties
have been seized and then occupied.

01:19:48.820 --> 01:19:50.094
Isn't it ironic?

01:19:50.220 --> 01:19:52.529
I occupied my own house!

01:19:52.700 --> 01:19:54.850
The law doesn't accept
irony as a right

01:19:54.980 --> 01:19:58.131
to illegal occupation, Mr Alberto.
- That's too bad.

01:19:58.340 --> 01:20:01.935
Until today, no one has forbidden us
to live in this house, ofﬁcer. No one!

01:20:02.140 --> 01:20:03.414
This house is shutdown,
there's no owner.

01:20:03.540 --> 01:20:05.178
I mean, no one knows who they are.

01:20:05.340 --> 01:20:07.979
So, tell me, why can't I live here
with my son?

01:20:08.100 --> 01:20:09.419
Do you want me to live on the street?

01:20:09.540 --> 01:20:11.929
- You should have thought about it...
- You know who these people are!

01:20:12.340 --> 01:20:13.409
Excuse me?

01:20:14.540 --> 01:20:15.609
Yes!

01:20:15.740 --> 01:20:17.298
They are friends of my father's...

01:20:17.420 --> 01:20:19.570
Or are you going to tell me
you don't know who my father is?

01:20:19.780 --> 01:20:21.498
Or my brother Chico?

01:20:21.780 --> 01:20:23.372
Or my brother Carrau?

01:20:25.260 --> 01:20:26.693
Well...

01:20:26.860 --> 01:20:28.930
Would you like to ﬁle a complaint?

01:20:29.060 --> 01:20:30.379
May I?

01:20:31.700 --> 01:20:33.179
Ofﬁcially, no.

01:20:33.380 --> 01:20:35.211
At least not against the property.

01:20:35.420 --> 01:20:38.412
But against your life
and the life of these people, you may.

01:20:38.660 --> 01:20:40.059
No, no, no.

01:20:40.180 --> 01:20:41.499
- What?!
- No.

01:20:42.100 --> 01:20:43.772
We'll do no such thing!

01:20:43.900 --> 01:20:45.618
You should file a complaint against us,

01:20:45.900 --> 01:20:48.858
since you're assuming
we're the ones breaking the law.

01:20:49.260 --> 01:20:50.454
I can't do that.

01:20:50.660 --> 01:20:53.220
Well, then, good night.

01:23:54.980 --> 01:23:56.857
How old is he?

01:23:57.700 --> 01:23:59.133
Four

01:23:59.340 --> 01:24:00.773
What's his name?

01:24:00.940 --> 01:24:02.373
Vicente.

01:24:04.300 --> 01:24:06.131
He's so cute.

01:24:06.980 --> 01:24:08.379
Yes...

01:24:08.500 --> 01:24:09.899
And a brat.

01:24:10.020 --> 01:24:12.534
He has yet to give me
a lot of headaches.

01:24:13.180 --> 01:24:14.738
He takes after those people...

01:24:14.860 --> 01:24:16.771
Joao didn't mean it.

01:24:17.300 --> 01:24:19.450
- Once he starts, he...
- I know.

01:24:20.140 --> 01:24:21.653
I understand.

01:24:22.860 --> 01:24:25.055
He's only taking his mother's side.

01:24:26.220 --> 01:24:27.573
That's life.

01:24:27.700 --> 01:24:28.974
But there...

01:24:30.220 --> 01:24:32.097
It was what it was.

01:24:33.620 --> 01:24:36.054
It was almost twenty years...

01:24:38.100 --> 01:24:41.490
But when you love someone,
you love them all the way.

01:24:41.860 --> 01:24:44.010
You do what you have to do.

01:24:44.460 --> 01:24:47.691
And I loved
Joao Maria's father very much.

01:24:47.860 --> 01:24:51.091
So much so,
I had everyone against me, as if...

01:24:53.420 --> 01:24:55.376
You know what it's like.

01:24:55.540 --> 01:24:56.529
Ido...

01:24:57.380 --> 01:24:59.848
I had to close the bookshop.

01:25:00.980 --> 01:25:03.653
I had such high hopes for Sines,

01:25:03.900 --> 01:25:06.368
yet Sines had none for me.

01:25:07.340 --> 01:25:09.217
You're different...

01:25:09.380 --> 01:25:11.450
You've been out there,

01:25:11.580 --> 01:25:13.730
you've seen the future.

01:25:24.100 --> 01:25:26.455
But the future hasn't arrived here yet.

01:25:28.820 --> 01:25:30.936
Well, I'd better go
before it starts raining...

01:25:32.300 --> 01:25:33.892
Miss Alcide?

01:25:40.060 --> 01:25:41.573
Pourquoi?

01:25:41.980 --> 01:25:43.129
Je suis son pére...

01:25:43.260 --> 01:25:44.579
J'ai Ie droit!

01:25:45.460 --> 01:25:46.495
Oui.

01:25:46.660 --> 01:25:48.696
Je suis au Portugal.

01:25:49.380 --> 01:25:51.769
Alors, je viens a‘ Bruxelles.

01:25:52.820 --> 01:25:53.969
Aid?

01:25:54.180 --> 01:25:55.408
Aid?

01:26:03.940 --> 01:26:06.374
- Can I burn a cigarette?
- Sure.

01:26:14.500 --> 01:26:16.377
What's his name?

01:26:18.380 --> 01:26:19.972
I don't know.

01:26:21.060 --> 01:26:23.528
His mother must've changed
his name by now. I don't know...

01:26:24.700 --> 01:26:26.816
No one knows where they are...

01:26:26.980 --> 01:26:29.335
Or they do, but they won't tell me.

01:26:32.260 --> 01:26:34.490
How do you live like this?

01:26:38.740 --> 01:26:40.492
You don't.

01:26:41.260 --> 01:26:43.410
You survive...

01:26:45.540 --> 01:26:47.531
Why did you stay?

01:26:47.820 --> 01:26:50.050
Why didn't you leave?

01:26:51.300 --> 01:26:53.211
ButI did, Al Berto.

01:26:54.740 --> 01:26:56.856
I ran away from here.

01:27:03.540 --> 01:27:05.531
I came back six months ago.

01:27:05.700 --> 01:27:06.928
It didn't work out...

01:27:07.220 --> 01:27:08.812
They didn't let me stay.

01:27:11.220 --> 01:27:13.609
I took my son to Canada,

01:27:14.660 --> 01:27:16.855
but they didn't let us stay.

01:27:19.020 --> 01:27:20.658
So I came back.

01:27:22.980 --> 01:27:25.699
I had to buy everything again.

01:27:28.100 --> 01:27:31.331
I came back with only my son
and a bag of clothes.

01:27:33.300 --> 01:27:36.417
I had to start over...

01:27:39.780 --> 01:27:43.011
When I arrived in Sines I thought
things would be a lot easier.

01:27:43.220 --> 01:27:44.892
It made sense.

01:27:45.500 --> 01:27:48.219
My memories,
even the bad ones, are here.

01:27:48.420 --> 01:27:50.888
It made sense to start here.

01:27:52.940 --> 01:27:55.056
But it's not just up to us.

01:27:56.380 --> 01:27:58.018
It's really tough.

01:28:00.180 --> 01:28:02.569
And doing something different...

01:28:02.820 --> 01:28:04.811
Being different...

01:28:05.300 --> 01:28:07.860
You end up paying the price.

01:28:09.940 --> 01:28:11.498
I have.

01:28:13.300 --> 01:28:15.609
And you're paying it now.

01:28:27.380 --> 01:28:28.972
He sent me a letter.

01:28:30.940 --> 01:28:33.932
Saying he's in Lisbon
for a few weeks to take care of...

01:28:34.060 --> 01:28:37.609
some stuff...
His book, the publisher...

01:28:38.420 --> 01:28:39.978
Did he mention my book?

01:28:41.700 --> 01:28:43.099
No.

01:28:45.060 --> 01:28:47.096
I think my mother's right.

01:28:47.780 --> 01:28:49.259
About what?

01:28:49.980 --> 01:28:52.892
That my fate is to stay with her
down at the fish market.

01:31:56.780 --> 01:31:59.248
Why won't you tell me
what happened?

01:32:02.580 --> 01:32:04.536
He's your friend...

01:32:05.060 --> 01:32:06.812
What about you?

01:32:09.220 --> 01:32:10.858
I'm your friend too.

01:32:12.780 --> 01:32:14.532
That's why.

01:32:16.300 --> 01:32:18.894
It's better if you don't know anything.

01:32:22.660 --> 01:32:24.616
What about us, Al Berto?

01:32:27.860 --> 01:32:30.454
What are we going to do without you?

01:32:32.420 --> 01:32:34.729
You'll keep on living...

01:32:36.900 --> 01:32:38.891
But it isn't the same.

01:32:41.980 --> 01:32:44.289
It will never be the same.

01:34:04.900 --> 01:34:06.253
Good morning.

01:34:07.700 --> 01:34:09.053
Good morning.

01:34:09.820 --> 01:34:12.015
I have to get to work.
Will you be alright?

01:34:12.900 --> 01:34:14.253
Yes...

01:34:15.300 --> 01:34:17.018
and thank you.

01:34:17.180 --> 01:34:18.772
You're a baby.

01:34:21.580 --> 01:34:24.492
I can't stay here alone,
what can I say?

01:34:26.580 --> 01:34:28.491
I miss him...

01:34:30.060 --> 01:34:31.652
Yes, I know.

01:34:34.180 --> 01:34:36.978
I'm going to bring some clothes tonight
because it's getting cold and...

01:34:37.940 --> 01:34:39.692
sleeping naked is all very well,

01:34:39.900 --> 01:34:41.128
but only in the movies.

01:34:44.660 --> 01:34:46.093
Kiss...

01:34:46.500 --> 01:34:47.819
See you later.

01:34:49.420 --> 01:34:50.819
See you.

01:35:25.860 --> 01:35:27.179
- Good afternoon, Miss Manuela.
- Good afternoon.

01:35:27.500 --> 01:35:29.491
Here's a letter from the court.

01:35:29.620 --> 01:35:30.689
The court?

01:35:31.460 --> 01:35:32.893
I think it's about the house...

01:36:16.660 --> 01:36:17.729
Belga?

01:36:32.700 --> 01:36:34.816
Joaozinho...

01:36:36.540 --> 01:36:38.496
You fucked around so much

01:36:38.780 --> 01:36:40.213
you fucked everything up.

01:36:46.300 --> 01:36:48.450
The party's over!

01:37:46.140 --> 01:37:47.539
Al Berto?

01:37:47.940 --> 01:37:51.296
Al Berto, come on! Al Berto!

01:37:56.740 --> 01:37:58.014
Al Berto!

01:37:58.220 --> 01:37:59.699
Fuck!

01:38:01.060 --> 01:38:03.335
Please, Al Berto...

01:38:13.940 --> 01:38:15.498
Al Berto...
