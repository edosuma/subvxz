but foretelling the future.

00:08.048 --> 00:09.847
- Whose future?
- Yours.

00:09.883 --> 00:11.966
Your wounds
were likely inflicted

00:12.002 --> 00:14.002
by some sort of animal claw.

- Yes.

- That's for you to say.

00:27.367 --> 00:29.817

- Let them stare.

00:29.853 --> 00:33.538
- Does this corset flatter me?
- Yes.

00:33.573 --> 00:36.541
It's my cousin, you see,
she's coming to visit me

00:36.576 --> 00:39.077
and she's a simple girl,

00:39.129 --> 00:40.628

Oh, yes,
our clairvoyant friend.

00:45.535 --> 00:47.885
Well,
proceed with caution, eh?

00:52.392 --> 00:54.926

- That's impossible.

00:54.978 --> 00:56.427
I appreciate
your honesty, Malcolm.

00:56.479 --> 00:58.513
<i>And it's always good to
have something to aim at.</i>

00:59.315 --> 01:01.683
Do you truly not
believe in heaven?

01:01.718 --> 01:03.317
We are accountable
to no one but each other.

01:03.353 --> 01:05.687
That's a profound
responsibility.

01:05.722 --> 01:07.321
I'll prepare the enchantment
for tonight.

01:07.357 --> 01:08.956
- You know what to bring me?
- Yes.

01:08.992 --> 01:10.692
Don't disappoint me
again, girl.

01:10.727 --> 01:13.111
You'll understand
I find it difficult to accept

01:13.163 --> 01:15.863

[Ethan] I know what a siege
is like. I've been there.

05:50.673 --> 05:52.540
You get the enemy
when they're relaxed

05:52.575 --> 05:54.742
and making dinner
or feeding their babies.

05:54.811 --> 05:57.645
You get them concentrated
in one location,

05:57.697 --> 05:59.947
you surround them,
and then you attack

05:59.983 --> 06:01.582
with every weapon
at your disposal

06:01.617 --> 06:03.417

[Sir Malcolm]
When were you in a siege?

06:14.080 --> 06:15.663
During the Indian Wars.

06:15.665 --> 06:17.381
I was seconded
to a cavalry unit

06:17.417 --> 06:18.916
that had as its goal

06:19.002 --> 06:21.168
the annihilation
of the Apaches.

06:21.204 --> 06:23.971
Dress it up any way you want,
that's what it was.

06:27.010 --> 06:29.593
We were in the southern part
of the Arizona Territory

06:29.645 --> 06:31.345
and there's one little tribe

06:31.397 --> 06:33.247
we're supposed to send
to the reservation

06:33.282 --> 06:35.483
or murder, didn't matter.

06:35.518 --> 06:37.618
They were dug in
on a Cliffside.

06:38.955 --> 06:40.921
We moved in at night,

06:40.957 --> 06:43.190
with our horses' hooves
wrapped in burlap.

06:43.226 --> 06:45.559
We surrounded them
very slowly.

06:46.696 --> 06:49.030
Hours of getting
into position.

06:49.632 --> 06:52.950
Some of us lucky ones
who spoke Chiricahua

06:53.002 --> 06:54.735
infiltrated the village.

06:54.771 --> 06:57.738
We stood in the darkness
20 feet away

06:57.774 --> 07:02.009
while they talked
and smoked and made dinner.

07:03.546 --> 07:05.429
They had no idea.

07:05.465 --> 07:07.548
They thought they were safe.

07:08.618 --> 07:10.251
They had underestimated

07:10.286 --> 07:12.653
the ruthlessness
of their enemies.

07:14.557 --> 07:15.656
Sound familiar?

07:16.626 --> 07:18.025
What happened?

07:18.061 --> 07:20.361
One bugle call
and we attacked.

07:20.396 --> 07:23.397
We didn't talk.
We didn't negotiate.

07:25.118 --> 07:26.951
My squad worked
from the inside out.

07:26.986 --> 07:28.536
They had nowhere to run.

07:29.572 --> 07:33.074
In 15 minutes... that tribe
had ceased to exist.

07:34.961 --> 07:37.661
They were wiped from history.

07:39.916 --> 07:43.017
We can't let ourselves
be infiltrated and surrounded.

07:45.421 --> 07:47.121

07:57.316 --> 07:59.300
They're making a fetish.

08:07.193 --> 08:08.609

There is lore

And rituals.

08:43.645 --> 08:46.614
And sturdy locks

18:14.767 --> 18:16.416

18:16.452 --> 18:18.185
I said I didn't know.

18:18.220 --> 18:19.953

if she must love you now.

18:19.988 --> 18:22.589

it was up to her entirely.

18:23.358 --> 18:24.691
Was I wrong?

18:25.994 --> 18:27.694
- [loudly] Was I wrong?
- No. No.

No, she must... care for me
of her own accord.

18:34.403 --> 18:35.635
[sighing]

18:43.829 --> 18:46.046

- In what way?
- [gasps]

18:51.336 --> 18:53.553
[scoffs] Such sadism,
even now.

18:53.589 --> 18:55.972
She knows you look differently
than she or I.

18:57.176 --> 18:59.092
She's seen no one else.

19:01.930 --> 19:03.930
If you come
as the jolly wooer...

19:04.767 --> 19:06.433

19:06.435 --> 19:08.602

gone from my existence

never drawn breath.

19:10.405 --> 19:12.439

Cousin Victor, you won't stay?

19:59.321 --> 20:01.655
I've... work downstairs.

20:02.908 --> 20:04.708
I'll come back.

20:10.916 --> 20:12.999
Won't you sit, sir?

20:14.336 --> 20:15.669
Thank you.

20:23.679 --> 20:25.011
[Lily sighs]

20:29.268 --> 20:31.568
And you may call me John,
if you will.

20:33.021 --> 20:35.121
- That's a lovely dress.
- What?

20:36.942 --> 20:39.025
Yes. Victor picked it out.

20:42.197 --> 20:44.130
And... do you like it?

20:45.167 --> 20:47.400
Yes. Victor picked it out.

20:52.941 --> 20:54.674
You're looking at my face.

20:54.710 --> 20:58.378
Uh... I don't mean to.
I can't help it.

21:00.849 --> 21:04.050
Kind eyes can look on anything
and find it beautiful.

21:04.052 --> 21:05.318
[stammers]

21:06.104 --> 21:09.105
[stammering] I don't mean
to be forward. I'm sorry.

21:12.644 --> 21:15.228
Ours is
an exceptional history.

21:17.449 --> 21:20.033
We were friends... once,
and...

21:21.036 --> 21:24.204
and that...
friendship grew between us.

21:24.239 --> 21:25.872
Victor told me.

21:25.908 --> 21:28.875
Well, let me tell you,
for I was there.

21:30.646 --> 21:32.779
I remember, one night,
we were walking

21:32.814 --> 21:34.464
through the village...

21:34.499 --> 21:36.883
and we came across some men
outside a tavern,

21:36.919 --> 21:38.468
drunken they were.

21:40.422 --> 21:42.505
And they saw me with you...

21:42.557 --> 21:45.642
and they laughed
and pointed and said,

21:45.677 --> 21:48.561
"How could the likes of her
be with the likes of him?"

21:49.998 --> 21:51.498
And what did you do?

21:52.167 --> 21:53.833
It was more what you did.

21:55.003 --> 21:58.038
You took my hand...
and you held it.

21:59.858 --> 22:01.574
And you looked at them.

22:03.412 --> 22:05.662
Then you raised
my hand to your lips...

22:08.550 --> 22:10.116
and you held it there.

22:10.168 --> 22:11.785
I don't remember.

22:14.423 --> 22:16.756
- And yet it happened.
- To someone else.

22:19.127 --> 22:21.294
I've no wish
to cause you pain.

22:22.214 --> 22:24.681
Let us start
by being friends, Mr. Clare.

22:24.716 --> 22:26.383
I can do no other.

22:32.274 --> 22:33.556
I understand.

22:35.110 --> 22:36.609
[Lily sniffling]

22:53.729 --> 22:55.962
[breathing deeply]

23:25.527 --> 23:28.028
- [Gladys struggling]
- [Madame Kali] <i>Lucifer.</i>

23:28.080 --> 23:30.697
[Madame Kali speaking
demonic language]

23:33.702 --> 23:35.251
[screaming]

23:37.706 --> 23:40.373
[continues speaking
demonic language]

23:48.100 --> 23:50.050
[screaming]

24:09.287 --> 24:11.738
[Rusk clears throat]
Mr. Chandler?

24:16.461 --> 24:17.911
Who's asking?

24:20.665 --> 24:23.967
Inspector Bartholomew Rusk...
Scotland Yard.

24:26.471 --> 24:28.555
I should like a few words,
if I may.

24:32.928 --> 24:34.094
You may.

24:36.431 --> 24:38.815
Perhaps my office
would be more comfortable?

24:40.936 --> 24:42.185
For whom?

24:44.823 --> 24:46.106
This way.

25:06.461 --> 25:08.011
[Frankenstein] Miss Ives.

25:08.046 --> 25:09.129
Doctor.

25:09.181 --> 25:11.764
May I present
Miss Lily Frankenstein.

25:12.717 --> 25:14.217
Such a pleasure, miss.

25:14.269 --> 25:16.519
Your cousin
has told me so much.

25:16.555 --> 25:18.555
How do you do, Miss Ives?

25:41.663 --> 25:43.496
What's the one thing
a sharpshooter

25:43.548 --> 25:44.998
is sure to need?

25:46.801 --> 25:48.218
[Ethan grunting]

25:48.887 --> 25:50.003
Bullets.

25:51.056 --> 25:53.556
I've given up
the theatrical profession.

25:53.592 --> 25:54.557
Oh, why?

25:55.260 --> 25:57.927
It didn't suit my character.

25:57.979 --> 26:02.432
Yes... I see you don't
seem made for the limelight.

26:02.484 --> 26:04.684
- Then again, we've just met.
- Indeed.

26:09.241 --> 26:11.741
One wonders how you keep
body and soul together...

26:12.994 --> 26:14.527
without employment.

26:14.579 --> 26:16.696
[Ethan]
Bit of this, bit of that.

26:23.038 --> 26:25.038
I lost it in the Transvaal.

26:25.090 --> 26:26.756
Boer sharpshooter.

26:27.709 --> 26:29.375
I think a carbine.

26:29.411 --> 26:31.211
They never use
long-barreled weapons,

26:31.246 --> 26:33.146
they are so frequently
on horseback.

26:34.316 --> 26:37.617
Much like your, um...
Red Indians, yes?

26:38.119 --> 26:39.586
Is that right?

26:39.621 --> 26:42.889
I mean, you must know weapons,
given your former occupation.

26:42.891 --> 26:46.259
Just the theatrical kind.
I'm not that good a shot.

26:46.294 --> 26:48.561
We used shotgun pellets
in the show.

26:48.563 --> 26:51.531
Well... these aren't pellets.

26:52.534 --> 26:54.284
And I'm not in the show.

26:56.571 --> 26:58.488
You lived
in the Mariner's Inn.

26:58.540 --> 26:59.706
Did I?

27:00.542 --> 27:04.444
You registered
September 25th last year.

27:05.330 --> 27:06.713
[Ethan] Must have then.

27:07.999 --> 27:10.583
- Where do you live now?
- Elsewhere.

27:12.721 --> 27:15.054
Are you aware of the recent
trouble at the inn?

27:15.090 --> 27:16.506
No.

27:16.558 --> 27:18.224
Don't you read the newspapers?

27:18.260 --> 27:19.509
No.

27:22.430 --> 27:23.796
There were murders.

27:23.832 --> 27:25.431
- Were there?
- Many.

27:26.067 --> 27:27.300
Shame.

27:27.335 --> 27:29.636
All of the guests at the inn
have been accounted for

27:29.671 --> 27:31.988
but for one... Brona Croft

27:32.023 --> 27:35.074
and one... Ethan Chandler.

27:37.329 --> 27:39.279
- And?
- And...

27:41.249 --> 27:44.450
- I am bound to ask.
- And am I bound to answer?

27:44.452 --> 27:46.352
Well, you haven't
been remanded.

27:46.388 --> 27:49.055
- Am I free to leave?
- Any time you like.

27:58.099 --> 28:00.717
We've had some trouble
here in London.

28:00.769 --> 28:03.136
It started in early
September last year.

28:03.188 --> 28:04.504
Is that so?

28:04.539 --> 28:06.139
According to customs records,

28:06.191 --> 28:09.809
that was when you arrived
with your Wild West show.

28:09.811 --> 28:12.278
September 3rd,
to be precise.

28:13.898 --> 28:15.398
How can I help?

28:15.450 --> 28:17.016
You can tell me
why an American

28:17.085 --> 28:18.785
who is seemingly
without employment

28:18.820 --> 28:21.738
and a place of residence
and proficient in firearms

28:21.790 --> 28:23.539
is currently buying ordinance.

28:24.326 --> 28:27.377
- Is it illegal?
- Not in the slightest.

28:27.412 --> 28:29.462
Were the people
who were killed shot?

28:29.497 --> 28:31.047
Not a one.

28:31.082 --> 28:32.832
Well, then, I'm not quite sure

28:32.884 --> 28:34.550
what I'm doing here,
Inspector Rusk.

28:34.636 --> 28:36.085
Because...

28:39.808 --> 28:41.174
you're a mystery.

28:42.110 --> 28:45.378
- And you don't like mysteries.
- I like order.

28:46.648 --> 28:48.731
And peaceable streets
upon which to walk.

28:49.851 --> 28:51.100
As do I.

28:52.187 --> 28:53.269
[exhales sharply]

28:53.321 --> 28:56.439
There was something different
about the Mariner's Inn.

28:57.158 --> 28:59.158
There was a survivor.

29:01.329 --> 29:03.196
That must be useful to you.

29:03.248 --> 29:04.781
Well, people who were there

29:04.833 --> 29:06.733
seem to have a way
of forgetting things.

29:06.768 --> 29:08.468
Well, it was
a forgettable place.

29:09.637 --> 29:10.837
Not to me.

29:12.340 --> 29:14.173
- What's your name?
- You know my name.

29:14.209 --> 29:16.476
I know your stage name.

29:16.511 --> 29:18.711
We've been cabling
our American colleagues

29:18.763 --> 29:20.847
for information
on an "Ethan Chandler"

29:20.882 --> 29:23.216
with few useful results
thus far.

29:23.268 --> 29:26.269
I have reams of documents
on a farmer in Iowa,

29:26.304 --> 29:29.522
and a cotton grower
in Louisiana...

29:29.557 --> 29:32.642
and... a chemist in New York.

29:35.897 --> 29:38.448
All men... without mystery.

29:39.567 --> 29:41.984
That must be frustrating
for you.

29:43.238 --> 29:44.737
Only temporarily.

29:45.740 --> 29:48.157
Well, since I have
nothing to tell you...

29:49.160 --> 29:50.293
- [clears throat]
- Of course.

29:50.328 --> 29:52.245
Do you mind
if I walk with you?

29:52.247 --> 29:54.497
I never seem to get
any air in this job.

29:54.549 --> 29:55.748
My pleasure.

29:56.718 --> 29:58.634
He's been very generous.

29:58.670 --> 30:00.336
Yes, the doctor is a kind man.

30:00.388 --> 30:02.755
I think that rather comes
with the job.

30:08.146 --> 30:10.730
And... are you intending
to remain in London?

30:11.649 --> 30:12.815
As long as she likes.

30:12.851 --> 30:14.600
As long as he'll have me.

30:16.688 --> 30:20.022
Makes a... change
from the country at any rate.

30:22.193 --> 30:25.194
And... how do you
find London, Lily?

30:27.499 --> 30:28.948
The weather is challenging,

30:28.950 --> 30:31.117
but the excitement
is palpable.

30:36.925 --> 30:38.374
There's a lot to explore here.

30:38.426 --> 30:40.193
Have you seen much
of the city?

30:41.596 --> 30:44.130
Just the... usual
tourist spots mostly.

30:44.632 --> 30:46.332
[Lily] It's very loud.

30:46.718 --> 30:48.718
Loud. That's silly. Sorry.

30:48.770 --> 30:51.687
No, no, you're right.
The din is everlasting.

30:56.394 --> 30:57.693
I think
that's probably enough.

30:57.729 --> 31:00.029
Sorry. [laughing]
These are fun.

31:00.064 --> 31:02.482
[chuckling] They are indeed.

31:04.869 --> 31:07.153
Well, if you'll excuse me,
I've an engagement.

31:08.122 --> 31:10.907
I do hope we'll see you at
Grandage Place soon, Doctor.

31:10.959 --> 31:12.658
- We miss you.
- Of course.

31:14.295 --> 31:17.580
Such a pleasure, Lily.
I hope we'll meet again.

31:17.632 --> 31:19.298
You're very pretty.

31:19.334 --> 31:22.084
Well, thank you. As are you.

31:22.136 --> 31:23.970
And thank you for the dress.

31:24.005 --> 31:25.388
[mock whispering]
Next time we'll go alone.

31:25.423 --> 31:27.340
I think the doctor
was mortified.

31:29.310 --> 31:31.344
- Good day to you both.
- Miss Ives.

31:36.684 --> 31:39.185
Did I do all right, Victor?

31:39.187 --> 31:40.853
You were perfect.

31:54.586 --> 31:57.336
[Rusk] It's never what
you think it's going to be.

31:57.372 --> 31:59.455
We expected a proper
military engagement

31:59.507 --> 32:01.757
but the Boers
didn't play along.

32:03.011 --> 32:05.461
There we were
in our formations...

32:05.513 --> 32:07.179
and our scarlet uniforms

32:07.215 --> 32:10.216
while they were a guerilla
force who struck at will.

32:10.268 --> 32:12.518
Never seen better
on horseback.

32:13.521 --> 32:15.805
Like the Sioux Indians
in your country.

32:15.857 --> 32:17.056
I read about them
in dime novels.

32:17.058 --> 32:19.392
Your accent
isn't from the East.

32:20.645 --> 32:22.395
Aren't you a Westerner?

32:22.447 --> 32:24.363
You've been to America?

32:25.400 --> 32:26.782
I have an ear.

32:28.069 --> 32:30.453
Works with the ladies.
Who doesn't love a cowboy?

32:30.488 --> 32:33.406
- Or a soldier.
- I suppose.

32:34.826 --> 32:36.208
Your War Department
hasn't been

32:36.244 --> 32:38.244
particularly forthcoming
with records.

32:38.246 --> 32:40.997
Too busy invading Haiti
and killing Red Indians

32:41.049 --> 32:43.416
at the moment I should think.

32:43.468 --> 32:44.917
But I'll keep at it.

32:44.919 --> 32:46.168
You do that.

32:47.305 --> 32:49.005
It's been a pleasure,
Inspector.

32:49.057 --> 32:51.557
But I've got shopping to do
if you'd excuse me?

32:52.510 --> 32:53.759
Of course.

32:56.648 --> 32:58.314
Be careful, Mr. Chandler.

33:02.487 --> 33:04.103
With the bullets.

33:06.024 --> 33:07.356
Inspector.

33:13.164 --> 33:14.530
Excuse me.

33:34.852 --> 33:36.185
[woman] Thank you.

33:41.025 --> 33:42.558
[Vanessa] Mr. Clare.

33:43.811 --> 33:45.144
[Mr. Clare] Miss Ives.

33:45.813 --> 33:48.114
Do you know you share
your name with a dead poet?

33:49.233 --> 33:50.566
Yes. [chuckles]

33:51.903 --> 33:53.219
Do you like poetry?

33:53.254 --> 33:55.321
All sad people like poetry.

33:55.323 --> 33:57.156
Happy people like songs.

33:57.191 --> 33:58.991
[both chuckle]

34:02.030 --> 34:04.664
I've always been moved
by John Clare's story.

34:06.334 --> 34:09.101
By all accounts he was
only five feet tall, so...

34:09.137 --> 34:10.735
considered freakish.

34:12.340 --> 34:15.741
Perhaps due to this, he felt
a singular affinity with...

34:15.777 --> 34:17.943
the outcasts
and the unloved...

34:19.414 --> 34:22.947
the ugly animals...
the broken things.

34:25.253 --> 34:26.485
"I am

34:27.889 --> 34:30.856
yet what I am
none care or knows.

34:33.393 --> 34:36.295
My friends forsake me
like a memory lost.

34:38.132 --> 34:40.666
I am the self-consumer
of my woes.

34:42.003 --> 34:45.036
They rise and vanish
in oblivious host,

34:45.072 --> 34:49.408
like shadows in love's
frenzied stifled throes.

34:50.911 --> 34:53.411
And yet I am, and live..."

34:54.815 --> 34:56.482
[both] "Like vapors tossed..."

34:58.453 --> 35:01.954
"I long for scenes
where man hath never trod.

35:03.091 --> 35:06.492
A place where woman
never smiled or wept.

35:07.895 --> 35:10.596
There to abide
with my Creator, God.

35:11.666 --> 35:15.134
And sleep as I in childhood
sweetly slept.

35:15.737 --> 35:19.138
Untroubling and untroubled
where I lie."

35:20.675 --> 35:24.510
[both] "The grass below,
above, the vaulted sky."

35:31.385 --> 35:33.719
I wonder
if he ever found it...

35:33.755 --> 35:35.521
his silent place with God.

35:37.525 --> 35:40.226
Oh, the poem tells me

But... she touched his hand.

36:10.525 --> 36:11.624

36:13.461 --> 36:15.161
something
I'd never seen before.

36:16.230 --> 36:17.997
A kind of peace, anyway.

36:19.734 --> 36:21.333

are too grave.

cast our boats on that sea?

to navigate the waters
