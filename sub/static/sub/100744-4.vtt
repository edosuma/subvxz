WEBVTT

00:11.000 --> 00:13.440
[Uhtred] <i>I am Uhtred, son of Uhtred.</i>

00:14.040 --> 00:15.400
<i>My lifelong ambition</i>

00:15.480 --> 00:20.120
<i>to take back my birthright</i>
<i>to Bebbanburg has ended in failure.</i>

00:20.200 --> 00:21.320
Beocca!

00:21.400 --> 00:25.280
-He is with God now. He is at peace.
-[sobs]

00:25.360 --> 00:29.000
<i>While I struggle to come to terms</i>
<i>with this devastating loss,</i>

00:29.680 --> 00:32.960
<i>Haesten has revealed the true cause</i>
<i>of Ragnar’s death.</i>

00:35.240 --> 00:38.240
[Haesten] Let me live
and I'll tell you who gave the command.

00:38.320 --> 00:40.120
-Speak.
-Cnut.

00:41.680 --> 00:44.880
<i>But Brida knows nothing</i>
<i>of Cnut’s treachery...</i>

00:45.400 --> 00:48.320
<i>and prepares to ride into battle with him.</i>

00:48.400 --> 00:52.400
When the kings are dead,
we will sit together on Alfred’s throne.

00:52.920 --> 00:58.360
<i>Aethelred, blinded by lust and power,</i>
<i>has foolishly invaded Daneland.</i>

00:59.200 --> 01:02.600
[Eardwulf] Cnut did not sail to Irland.
Haesten gave me false information.

01:02.680 --> 01:05.960
-You must tell Aethelred the truth!
-If I tell him the truth, he will kill me.

01:06.440 --> 01:08.400
[Eadith]
I will do all I can to soften the blow.

01:08.960 --> 01:13.480
<i>Aethelhelm’s influence on Edward</i>
<i>has caused conflict in Winchester.</i>

01:13.880 --> 01:15.040
These are my people.

01:15.120 --> 01:19.600
I will not send them to be slaughtered
while Cnut sets the terms of the battle!

01:20.400 --> 01:23.520
You will take a message to the Welsh King.

01:23.600 --> 01:27.440
Aethelflaed is expecting an army.
We must deliver one.

01:28.600 --> 01:33.440
<i>I have taken Cnut’s sons as my prisoners</i>
<i>and brought them to Aethelflaed...</i>

01:33.520 --> 01:37.000
<i>to be used as bait in the battle</i>
<i>I know is to come.</i>

01:39.280 --> 01:40.920
Destiny is all!

02:06.440 --> 02:09.360
[pants]

02:17.920 --> 02:19.920
The monastery is two miles south.

02:20.400 --> 02:22.200
I am not looking for the monastery.

02:23.280 --> 02:25.760
-Saxons are not welcome here, Father.
-I know.

02:25.840 --> 02:27.920
But I’ve urgent business with King Hywel.

02:28.000 --> 02:28.840
[exhales]

02:29.160 --> 02:32.320
-Are you Saxon?
-Well, I was born a Briton.

02:32.400 --> 02:34.160
You will only find trouble here, Brother.

02:34.560 --> 02:37.480
You will find more than trouble
if you do not let me pass.

02:51.120 --> 02:54.160
[Young Uhtred] Oh, Lord,
grant us the knowledge of your power

02:54.240 --> 02:58.080
when it comes to pass that a man and wife
may bring a child into this world.

02:58.160 --> 03:02.440
They clothe him. They cherish him,
but God alone may know his fate.

03:02.520 --> 03:03.800
These children were in darkness.

03:03.880 --> 03:06.040
-[sobbing]
-Now they are saved.

03:06.400 --> 03:08.680
Bring them the light of your love,
Lord God...

03:09.240 --> 03:11.440
and let them walk as children of light.

03:11.760 --> 03:13.960
Where are they? Why is she not ready?

03:15.800 --> 03:16.920
They mourn the dead.

03:17.600 --> 03:21.480
...than he who considers
before his soul’s departure

03:21.560 --> 03:23.880
how worthy he may be deemed
after his death...

03:23.960 --> 03:25.400
There is no time for this.

03:25.480 --> 03:26.920
[breathes heavily]

03:27.000 --> 03:29.360
They are children, Uhtred.

03:29.800 --> 03:32.400
Sons of Mercia's most revered men.

03:32.800 --> 03:33.720
[sobs softly]

03:33.800 --> 03:36.200
When did children become the cost of war?

03:39.800 --> 03:41.600
[Uhtred] You did all that you could.

03:42.880 --> 03:44.160
Now, come.

03:45.400 --> 03:48.360
They took their heads. [inhales deeply]
All of them.

03:55.120 --> 03:58.280
We must move off
before the Danes know that you are here.

03:58.360 --> 04:00.240
Not until they have been blessed!

04:00.320 --> 04:03.640
-Aethelflaed, please--
-Not until they have been blessed!

04:03.720 --> 04:06.880
[Finan] Danes! The Danes are here, Lord!

04:08.120 --> 04:10.800
-They're heading towards the gates!
-How many?

04:10.880 --> 04:11.800
Too many, Lord!

04:11.880 --> 04:13.040
Stay back, Aethelflaed.

04:13.120 --> 04:15.960
Seeing you will inflame them.
Go! Upstairs now!

04:16.680 --> 04:19.240
-[Finan] They got past the entrance!
-Go. We will hold them off.

04:21.360 --> 04:22.839
[all yelling]

04:34.640 --> 04:35.480
[grunts]

04:35.560 --> 04:39.640
Give me the Lady
and you will not be slaughtered!

04:40.280 --> 04:41.560
Do not even consider it!

04:41.640 --> 04:45.480
-I will not have men murdered in my place!
-I will not see you taken!

04:45.560 --> 04:50.000
You have the word of Cnut!
He only wants Alfred's daughter!

04:50.080 --> 04:51.560
[all grunting]

04:52.200 --> 04:54.200
-Is there another way out?
-No!

04:54.880 --> 04:57.520
-Can we get to the roof?
-We would only get trapped.

04:57.600 --> 05:00.240
-Let me bargain.
-Lady, you are the bargain.

05:00.320 --> 05:03.400
[Aethelflaed] We cannot just let death
come to us. I will not just wait for it.

05:03.840 --> 05:06.560
What are we doing, Lord?
The door will not hold!

05:06.640 --> 05:08.560
-Bring me Cnut's sons.
-Sihtric!

05:08.640 --> 05:11.000
Uhtred, you cannot.
There will be another way.

05:11.080 --> 05:13.000
You must trust me and you must swear

05:13.080 --> 05:15.800
-to me you will stay here. Swear to me!
-Do not do this--

05:18.840 --> 05:20.720
Where is she?

05:23.840 --> 05:24.680
[men grunting]

05:24.760 --> 05:26.320
Kill them all!

05:26.760 --> 05:28.120
-[Uhtred] Enough!
-[silence]

05:32.120 --> 05:33.360
Come and face me.

05:38.800 --> 05:40.360
I have Cnut's sons.

05:43.200 --> 05:44.360
You are lying.

05:45.040 --> 05:48.280
[boys whimper]

05:52.840 --> 05:55.280
Leave this place
or I will cut their throats!

05:55.920 --> 05:57.240
Take a son of Cnut...

05:58.040 --> 06:00.040
every Dane in this land
will see it avenged!

06:00.120 --> 06:02.080
Yes and every Dane will come for you, too.

06:02.160 --> 06:03.960
The blood of his child will be
on your hands.

06:04.040 --> 06:05.880
Do not play games.

06:05.960 --> 06:09.680
Send them down now...
or all the men here will be killed.

06:09.760 --> 06:12.000
Leave this place
or I will cut off their heads!

06:12.080 --> 06:14.600
You harm them and every Saxon here dies!

06:16.080 --> 06:17.400
[Young Cnut] No!

06:18.440 --> 06:21.440
-[Young Cnut screams]
-[Esgar] No!

06:21.520 --> 06:23.960
[boys sob and scream]

06:24.040 --> 06:25.800
-[sword thuds]
-[screaming stops]

06:27.480 --> 06:28.800
[Uhtred grunts]

06:28.880 --> 06:31.560
No! [sobs]

06:35.360 --> 06:36.920
[Esgar] No!

06:37.000 --> 06:38.080
[Uhtred] Leave!

06:39.120 --> 06:40.880
Or I will kill the other one also!

06:42.240 --> 06:43.280
Go!

06:44.120 --> 06:46.120
Now... go!

06:55.320 --> 06:56.360
No!

06:56.920 --> 06:59.760
-[Esgar sobs]
-Stay down. Look! Your brother’s alive.

07:45.920 --> 07:49.200
Cnut will hunt us as soon as he gets word
I killed his boy.

07:49.880 --> 07:53.440
-Surely we just show that they are alive?
-Danes do not work like that.

07:53.960 --> 07:55.400
We're now headed for battle.

07:55.480 --> 07:56.480
What about the boys?

07:56.560 --> 07:58.960
Cut them free and let them run.
They’ve served their purpose.

07:59.040 --> 08:01.200
And was the purpose
to enrage a Danish army?

08:01.640 --> 08:04.560
It bought us time
and allowed us to escape with our lives.

08:04.640 --> 08:06.800
Fate wants to drag us
to fight for the Saxons.

08:06.880 --> 08:09.920
[laughs] Yes. It was definitely fate
that dragged us into all of this.

08:10.000 --> 08:11.760
Uhtred had nothing to do with it.

08:11.840 --> 08:14.520
I do not seek battles.
Battles just seem to seek me.

08:14.600 --> 08:15.840
[Finan chuckles]

08:15.920 --> 08:18.320
[Uhtred] But you are right,
I have unleashed a storm.

08:18.400 --> 08:21.480
Cnut will find us. This is now our fight.

08:21.560 --> 08:25.240
[Finan] It was our fight from the moment
you took those boys from Haesten, Lord.

08:29.840 --> 08:32.200
The men would be forgiven
for abandoning me.

08:32.680 --> 08:35.840
They like an adventure
and they’re loyal to a good leader.

08:37.120 --> 08:38.240
As are you.

08:46.520 --> 08:48.600
Which is the fastest road to Tettenhall?

09:00.080 --> 09:02.320
[pants]

09:04.600 --> 09:07.200
Do not fear the beast. He’s been fed.

09:07.280 --> 09:08.120
[men chuckle]

09:08.200 --> 09:11.000
-Does he like strangers?
-Only when cooked.

09:11.080 --> 09:13.080
[Hywel and men laugh]

09:15.200 --> 09:18.800
You are from the boy king in Wessex?
Why do you come crawling before us?

09:19.440 --> 09:21.520
Wessex would like to strike a bargain.

09:21.800 --> 09:23.920
I do not make treaties with Saxons.

09:24.000 --> 09:26.240
Nevertheless, we have an offer.

09:27.320 --> 09:30.880
There is concern in Wessex about Cnut
and his incursion into Mercia.

09:30.960 --> 09:35.120
Alfred's actions have bitten Edward
on the arse. So?

09:35.200 --> 09:37.920
Cnut's army is slaughtering
all in their path.

09:38.760 --> 09:43.360
You are not friends to us, Father Pyrlig.
Why should any of this concern me?

09:43.840 --> 09:46.640
Because it brings a dangerous heathen
to your border.

09:46.720 --> 09:49.280
And yet, our borders are strong...

09:50.000 --> 09:52.840
because we’ve been repelling Saxons
for years.

09:52.920 --> 09:54.720
[men laugh]

09:54.800 --> 09:57.920
As you know, Alfred wanted
all the Christian kingdoms to unite.

09:58.400 --> 10:01.960
Yes, under his banner,
so we could all bow to him.

10:02.040 --> 10:04.600
He wanted to conquer, not unite the faith.

10:04.680 --> 10:06.960
Nevertheless that faith
is now under threat.

10:07.840 --> 10:10.040
We follow the same one God
and share a common enemy.

10:10.120 --> 10:13.160
You know that, Lord King.
And you know to repel Cnut now

10:13.240 --> 10:17.400
will save you bloodshed later, so,
it is a bargain that works for both of us.

10:20.760 --> 10:21.920
[dog grunts]

10:23.800 --> 10:25.440
What are Edward's plans?

10:26.920 --> 10:28.920
Mercians are gathering at Tettenhall.

10:29.600 --> 10:32.600
There are... plans
for Wessex to join them.

10:33.880 --> 10:38.520
And what would I get in return,
in this holy war against the pagans?

10:38.600 --> 10:41.080
And do not tell me recompense in heaven.

10:41.560 --> 10:44.280
Celestial rewards do not build fortresses.

10:46.800 --> 10:47.960
What is it you want?

10:48.040 --> 10:54.000
The spoils of battle, all of them,
every last piece of Danish silver.

10:54.680 --> 10:57.240
That is not a promise
I have the authority to make.

10:58.160 --> 11:01.760
You are here on Edward's orders,
you must have his authority.

11:03.640 --> 11:05.600
Do I have your promise, Father Pyrlig?

11:09.000 --> 11:10.480
Let him swear upon the book.

11:21.120 --> 11:27.360
[indistinct chattering in background]

11:34.600 --> 11:35.840
Eardwulf!

11:37.800 --> 11:39.840
What news of our troops in Lindcylne?

11:39.920 --> 11:43.640
The settlements that surround it
are resisting, Lord, but we will prevail.

11:43.920 --> 11:45.000
I should hope so.

11:46.480 --> 11:50.720
I want all of East Anglia
or our bargain does not hold.

11:51.240 --> 11:53.880
It would be a shame
for your family to go unrewarded.

11:57.320 --> 11:58.560
After so much effort!

12:10.200 --> 12:11.840
He’s like a pig rolling in shit.
[chuckles]

12:12.840 --> 12:16.440
Ask me nothing of the detail.
It was a favor to you, not to him.

12:17.800 --> 12:20.560
It is enough that humping me
has lifted his spirits.

12:21.080 --> 12:23.000
So, you must tell him
the news from Mercia.

12:26.200 --> 12:28.240
-Perhaps I should delay--
-You cannot put it off.

12:29.600 --> 12:33.400
I know you are afraid,
but I have bought us some goodwill.

12:33.480 --> 12:36.240
-I'm not afraid. I'm just--
-You are afraid and so am I.

12:37.400 --> 12:40.840
But I have done my part, brother.
Now you do yours.

12:42.880 --> 12:44.200
[exhales slowly]

12:55.560 --> 12:57.640
[both grunt]

13:04.960 --> 13:05.840
[Steapa chuckles]

13:10.120 --> 13:12.320
[yelling and grunting]

13:12.400 --> 13:14.600
-[both pant]
-[chuckles]

13:14.680 --> 13:17.960
-Do not let me win, Steapa.
-Lord, I am not.

13:21.600 --> 13:22.720
What has happened?

13:29.760 --> 13:32.320
The settlements around Lindcylne
have capitulated.

13:32.960 --> 13:34.880
If you want to see some hands,
it can be arranged.

13:34.960 --> 13:35.880
[chuckles]

13:39.080 --> 13:40.800
And what’s the bad news?

13:42.400 --> 13:44.600
You are clearly waiting
to deliver bad news.

13:48.080 --> 13:49.960
News has come from Edward, Lord King.

13:51.200 --> 13:54.160
I regret to tell you
that Cnut's armies have raided Mercia

13:54.240 --> 13:56.120
and taken your palace at Aegelesburg.

14:00.000 --> 14:02.960
Is this the same Cnut that you told me
was heading to Irland...

14:03.960 --> 14:05.760
to help some feral cousin?

14:07.120 --> 14:08.080
Yes, Lord.

14:08.160 --> 14:10.560
Because of whom
I left my kingdom undefended?

14:12.720 --> 14:13.920
And now it is in ruins?

14:14.000 --> 14:15.920
There was no reason to mistrust
the information.

14:16.320 --> 14:19.320
My spy in the Danish camp was certain.
He swore it was true.

14:20.200 --> 14:22.920
-Haesten is a close ally of--
-Did you say Haesten?

14:25.080 --> 14:27.640
-Yes, Lord. He's a close--
-I know who he is!

14:28.400 --> 14:30.160
He is well known to be a liar!

14:31.800 --> 14:35.160
You are nothing but a rat's turd,
who should never have been trusted

14:35.240 --> 14:36.800
with anything more than an ax!

14:36.880 --> 14:38.320
[breathes heavily]

14:38.800 --> 14:39.880
I pitied you...

14:41.720 --> 14:45.640
gave your whore of a sister the chance
to restore your family and this...

14:46.200 --> 14:47.800
is how you repay me.

14:49.960 --> 14:51.920
Only a fool would have trusted Haesten.

14:52.920 --> 14:57.520
-I know, but I've made a plan to retake--
-My reputation will be ripped to shreds!

14:57.800 --> 14:59.760
We’ve had word from Lady Aethelflaed.

14:59.840 --> 15:02.560
She will be at Tettenhall,
where she plans to lure Cnut.

15:02.640 --> 15:05.560
So now my wife is heading to battle
before me...

15:06.240 --> 15:09.600
so that she can be revered
as the savior of my kingdom?

15:10.280 --> 15:12.840
How in the name of God
is that supposed to cheer me?

15:12.920 --> 15:14.520
I'm just saying that there is a plan.

15:15.480 --> 15:19.120
Lord, there is advantage in this,
if you play it right,

15:19.200 --> 15:22.080
a chance to return to Mercia
as the avenging hero.

15:24.760 --> 15:28.480
[breathes heavily]
Can the men get here by morning?

15:31.880 --> 15:36.800
Uh, yes, Lord. I can send orders
for them to return immediately.

15:38.280 --> 15:41.760
-This could be your greatest triumph--
-You are finished, Eardwulf!

15:43.560 --> 15:44.880
Please do not execute me.

15:44.960 --> 15:47.040
You will pray for execution.

15:48.600 --> 15:51.840
When we return to Aegelesburg,
I will publicly castrate you.

15:53.120 --> 15:57.560
And your family will never prosper
and your sister will never leave my bed.

15:57.640 --> 15:59.400
[breathes heavily]

16:16.560 --> 16:17.560
[door opens]

16:19.600 --> 16:21.960
Why have you sent Father Pyrlig to Wealas?

16:23.240 --> 16:26.840
Do not lie to me, Mother. We have spies
in every court from here to Rome!

16:30.200 --> 16:34.440
Hywel has Danes,
rampaging near his borders.

16:34.520 --> 16:37.040
It is only right for Pyrlig
to alert him to it.

16:37.120 --> 16:39.800
Have you asked Hywel for help?

16:42.280 --> 16:44.040
That is unforgiveable.

16:44.120 --> 16:45.560
I had to do something!

16:46.200 --> 16:49.600
Your sister has thrown herself
into the lion's mouth.

16:49.680 --> 16:51.440
I challenge any mother to act differently.

16:51.520 --> 16:54.720
You are not just any mother.
You are the mother of a king.

16:56.000 --> 17:00.000
Cnut wants us to march on his terms.
It is a trap you have walked into.

17:00.080 --> 17:04.440
But Hywel is a Christian,
and God wants us to be united.

17:04.520 --> 17:07.200
Hywel serves no one but his own people.

17:07.280 --> 17:10.319
In going to him,
you have made Wessex look divided.

17:10.400 --> 17:13.040
Cnut will hear of it
and think we are weak!

17:15.800 --> 17:20.040
Yes, but I want my daughter safe.

17:21.200 --> 17:24.079
Then you should have persuaded her
to stay in Wessex.

17:25.560 --> 17:29.400
My men would not forgive me for chasing
my sister into a hopeless battle.

17:30.200 --> 17:34.320
And yet you know they'll also revile you
for letting her die.

17:34.960 --> 17:37.720
Like it or not,
Aethelflaed has forced your hand.

17:37.800 --> 17:41.160
So I trade the life of Wessex soldiers
for my own honor?

17:41.240 --> 17:44.760
That is what soldiers are there for,
to do the King's bidding--

17:44.840 --> 17:47.120
Yes, but not the bidding
of the King's mother.

17:50.720 --> 17:54.440
Besides, it is too late.
Aethelflaed's fyrds are marching.

17:56.800 --> 17:59.960
You had word of that and did not tell me?

18:00.040 --> 18:02.800
You were elsewhere, making other plans.

18:05.280 --> 18:09.800
If you wanted men to speak your name
in awe,

18:10.600 --> 18:14.400
believe me, this was not the way.

18:26.600 --> 18:27.440
[door closes]

18:41.320 --> 18:42.160
Lord.

18:42.240 --> 18:44.720
I want all of these defenses
finished by sunset.

18:44.800 --> 18:46.320
-Yes, My Lord.
-Good.

18:49.600 --> 18:50.880
We are so close, Brida...

18:52.080 --> 18:53.880
to everything we ever wanted.

18:56.000 --> 19:00.120
Lands for our people to settle in
for generations.

19:03.800 --> 19:04.720
Cnut?

19:06.400 --> 19:07.360
Yes.

19:12.280 --> 19:15.160
-There’s something--
-Ah. It’s Bjorgulf,

19:15.240 --> 19:17.360
returning with Alfred's little bitch.

19:25.480 --> 19:26.920
Where is Aethelflaed?

19:28.800 --> 19:29.960
She escaped.

19:31.600 --> 19:32.760
How did this happen?

19:36.400 --> 19:37.360
Tell us.

19:39.880 --> 19:41.840
Uhtred Ragnarson is in Aegelesburg.

19:43.560 --> 19:45.040
He had your sons with him.

19:45.120 --> 19:47.560
Haesten appears to have traded them
for his life.

19:48.640 --> 19:50.920
Tell me that my sons live.
[breathes heavily]

19:53.360 --> 19:55.920
I will not harm you.
Just tell me the news.

20:14.160 --> 20:15.920
Uhtred beheaded your eldest son.

20:19.200 --> 20:22.760
He would have killed Esgar
had we not left.

20:28.440 --> 20:31.320
[yells angrily] No! Why? Why?

20:31.400 --> 20:33.760
[groans and yells]

20:34.480 --> 20:36.600
I want Uhtred Ragnarson taken immediately!

20:36.680 --> 20:39.040
-No.
-No one sleeps until he is found!

20:39.120 --> 20:42.280
No! This will be paid for in blood,
but we cannot let it distract us.

20:42.360 --> 20:44.680
Avenging my child is not a distraction!

20:44.760 --> 20:45.600
Jackdaw!

20:46.680 --> 20:51.320
Cnut, I share your grief and your anger.
The gods know I do.

20:51.400 --> 20:55.280
Please... do not let Uhtred lure you
into a fight. He's not the priority.

20:55.360 --> 20:56.480
He killed my firstborn

20:56.560 --> 20:58.200
And Esgar is still with him!

20:59.200 --> 21:01.240
-If I have no heir, all of this...
-Cnut.

21:01.320 --> 21:03.080
-All of this is for nothing!
-Cnut.

21:03.160 --> 21:05.080
Do not give up our battle position!

21:05.160 --> 21:09.600
It does not matter where we fight!
We have a thousand warriors!

21:09.680 --> 21:12.320
-Jackdaw! Prepare the men to march!
-I will.

21:12.400 --> 21:15.800
And send men ahead to find them!
We will follow... now!

21:16.480 --> 21:17.480
-Cnut--
-Leave me!

21:17.560 --> 21:19.280
This way is foolishness, Cnut!

21:19.360 --> 21:20.840
[Cnut] You find him, Jackdaw!

21:36.200 --> 21:37.600
You got a numb arse there?

21:42.800 --> 21:45.160
You get used to a numb arse
kneeling through church all day.

21:45.680 --> 21:47.280
It’s a damp arse that kills you.

21:47.920 --> 21:48.880
[chuckles]

21:53.040 --> 21:55.240
What do you think will happen
when we face the Danes?

21:55.320 --> 21:58.000
A numb arse will be the least
of our problems.

21:59.200 --> 22:02.120
-We're good fighters.
-When we are all fit to fight.

22:03.000 --> 22:05.800
I have fought alongside your father
for a while now.

22:06.440 --> 22:10.480
And he tends to come up with something...
at the last minute.

22:11.000 --> 22:14.160
And many men are loyal to Aethelflaed,
even at their own cost.

22:14.240 --> 22:17.880
And no doubt the pair of them
are devising a battle plan to save us all.

22:19.160 --> 22:21.120
[breathing heavily]

22:26.600 --> 22:28.920
[panting and kissing]

22:37.600 --> 22:40.840
[softly] Not here. Not with them so close.

22:41.920 --> 22:44.920
You would deny yourself
the day before a fight?

22:45.000 --> 22:46.480
It gives me strength.

22:47.600 --> 22:49.800
What if you die on the battlefield?

22:52.160 --> 22:56.880
I will not die, because God favors
those with goodness in their hearts.

22:59.800 --> 23:00.640
Maybe.

23:01.320 --> 23:03.400
I believe the gods play with us.

23:04.840 --> 23:08.480
And we do not know their reasons
or what is destined for us.

23:11.120 --> 23:13.680
But tonight, I will believe
what you believe.

23:15.920 --> 23:18.320
I thought your destiny was Bebbanburg.

23:23.000 --> 23:24.480
I thought that.

23:27.000 --> 23:28.480
For so long.

23:33.360 --> 23:36.800
But now I ask myself why I failed there.

23:40.400 --> 23:43.720
I know there is a plan for me,
yet I do not know what it is.

23:47.320 --> 23:49.280
Only that it leads me to you.

23:51.000 --> 23:56.000
And Finan is right. I chose to be here,
so, that must mean something.

23:57.600 --> 24:01.320
It means that you care for the fate
of Mercia and the Saxons.

24:02.160 --> 24:03.600
Now you sound like your father.

24:03.680 --> 24:04.680
[laughs]

24:05.600 --> 24:07.840
He only used me for his own wishes.

24:07.920 --> 24:11.240
Yes, he was a wise man,
and I tried to follow in his path.

24:11.320 --> 24:15.960
So, perhaps then,
I, too, should only use you for my wishes.

24:52.400 --> 24:53.240
Edward...

24:54.120 --> 24:55.200
come and rest.

24:56.200 --> 24:57.800
God is guiding you. I know it.

25:00.360 --> 25:02.080
[footsteps approaching]

25:02.160 --> 25:04.360
Do not turn away from all of your family.

25:05.440 --> 25:07.400
I know your son would like to see you.

25:08.000 --> 25:10.000
He often speaks fondly of you.

25:14.240 --> 25:16.840
A child without its father's guidance
will grow weak.

25:16.920 --> 25:19.400
Which is why I endeavor
to seek the Lord's help.

25:21.480 --> 25:23.280
So if you would leave me in peace.

25:29.360 --> 25:34.920
[door opens and closes]

25:41.760 --> 25:45.280
There's no point disturbing him.
He is still deep in prayer.

25:45.760 --> 25:48.120
He does not need divine guidance.

25:48.200 --> 25:50.920
He just needs to listen to those of us
that know the cost of battle.

25:51.000 --> 25:52.400
His mother’s been advising him.

25:52.480 --> 25:55.920
Yes. I’m afraid that’s not all
she’s been doing.

25:57.400 --> 26:01.000
Lady Aelswith was seen visiting
Edward's bastard at the monastery.

26:01.080 --> 26:06.240
I am told she arranged a reunion
between the boy and his mother.

26:06.320 --> 26:11.160
Why? What business has she showing
kindness to a whore and her offspring?

26:11.240 --> 26:12.600
I do not know.

26:13.800 --> 26:17.720
But a rumor persists that their marriage
was legitimate.

26:18.640 --> 26:20.120
A false rumor.

26:20.200 --> 26:23.480
But still one that could endanger my son,
when the time comes.

26:23.560 --> 26:25.040
[sobs and sighs]

26:26.400 --> 26:30.400
I trust you are keeping
your husband satisfied.

26:31.400 --> 26:33.760
Another son would strengthen our position.

26:34.480 --> 26:38.440
I try to, Father, but he is not
as attentive as he once was.

26:38.760 --> 26:41.120
The matters of Kingship weigh heavy
on him.

26:41.200 --> 26:43.480
Then you must try harder...

26:44.240 --> 26:49.400
because it is clear that Lady Aelswith
is following a plan of her own.

26:49.480 --> 26:51.320
Then you must do something to stop her,

26:51.400 --> 26:53.920
before she turns the King from me
and my son!

26:54.200 --> 26:57.120
I will do what I must. Trust me.

26:57.800 --> 27:02.480
I have not come this far to be thwarted
by a bitter widow.

27:07.320 --> 27:09.200
[men yelling]

27:35.280 --> 27:36.120
[Finan] Um...

27:37.240 --> 27:39.160
Is this the place?

27:39.240 --> 27:40.160
Yes.

27:40.480 --> 27:42.600
I'm not sure I can see Edward's camp.

27:43.600 --> 27:45.680
I’m not sure I can see anyone.

27:45.960 --> 27:47.240
He will be here.

27:50.600 --> 27:51.840
[horses whinnying]

28:10.800 --> 28:13.640
I sent word
that the fyrds should gather in the woods.

28:13.720 --> 28:16.440
I will ready them for battle
before my brother arrives.

28:17.400 --> 28:18.800
[men yelling indistinctly]

28:19.200 --> 28:20.240
[Finan] Lord.

28:20.640 --> 28:21.560
[Finan whistles] Men!

28:24.960 --> 28:27.760
-[Uhtred] That is not a fyrd.
-And they are not Mercian.

28:30.680 --> 28:32.360
You do not look like Christians.

28:32.440 --> 28:35.840
We are men from Wealas,
loyal to King Hywel.

28:35.920 --> 28:38.600
Are you an ally or an enemy of Mercia?

28:39.720 --> 28:41.560
We are here to fight Cnut, Lady.

28:41.840 --> 28:46.200
And best The Dane as we have bested
the Saxon for so many years.

28:46.280 --> 28:48.080
And the fyrds?

28:48.160 --> 28:51.520
I put them under the command
of the little bald priest.

28:51.600 --> 28:54.640
I am not bald! I'm certainly not little!

28:55.000 --> 28:58.440
Father Pyrlig! I do not understand?

28:58.520 --> 29:02.200
He rode to Wealas
to beg King Hywel for his army.

29:02.760 --> 29:06.560
[softly] Edward sent him to find allies.
I knew he would not abandon me!

29:06.640 --> 29:09.200
No, Lady. It was your mother who sent me.

29:09.880 --> 29:11.560
I have had no word from the King.

29:15.280 --> 29:16.760
Then we fight with what we have.

29:18.000 --> 29:20.440
-[Uhtred] It’s good to see you, Pyrlig.
-You, too, Lord Uhtred.

29:20.520 --> 29:22.000
-[chuckling]
-[Pyrlig] Finan! Sihtric!

29:22.080 --> 29:24.320
-Father Pyrlig!
-It’s good to see you are alive.

29:25.480 --> 29:28.240
Even with these Welshmen,
we may not be enough.

29:28.800 --> 29:32.400
I know you have summoned Cnut,
but you can still turn away with honor.

29:34.160 --> 29:36.800
No one would condemn you
for leaving an unfair fight.

29:37.480 --> 29:40.440
I do not fight for honor, Uhtred.

29:40.520 --> 29:43.400
I fight because
someone must make a stand against Cnut...

29:44.400 --> 29:46.160
even though I am forbidden.

29:46.760 --> 29:49.640
As a sister, I am defiant,
but as a daughter of Alfred,

29:49.720 --> 29:51.400
I am just doing my duty.

29:53.040 --> 29:57.520
Even if it wasn’t made for me,
I can't blindly follow the King's command.

29:58.320 --> 30:00.080
That is something I understand.

30:00.960 --> 30:04.120
Yet I cannot believe he has left me
to face this without him.

30:05.680 --> 30:08.400
I thought, somehow,
he would find it in his heart.

30:11.400 --> 30:13.160
What do I tell my men?

30:14.120 --> 30:14.960
[sighs]

30:17.600 --> 30:22.000
Tell them your brother is close behind us.
They must believe we have a chance.

30:34.960 --> 30:37.520
We've heard from Uhtred
and the Lady Aethelflaed.

30:37.600 --> 30:38.640
Where are they?

30:39.800 --> 30:41.840
They’re waiting for you
at a place called Tettenhall.

30:42.800 --> 30:43.720
We go?

30:45.680 --> 30:48.000
It mocks the gods to give away
the advantage!

30:53.320 --> 30:54.880
I will have my revenge.

30:56.480 --> 31:01.200
[warriors bang shields rhythmically]

31:25.320 --> 31:27.080
There are worse places to defend.

31:28.560 --> 31:30.920
With a few more men,
we would stand a chance.

31:38.000 --> 31:39.080
Follow me.

31:43.800 --> 31:45.760
[grunting]

31:47.600 --> 31:48.880
[grunts]

31:56.720 --> 31:57.720
It is prepared.

32:00.600 --> 32:01.480
Will it work?

32:03.560 --> 32:04.480
I do not know.

32:07.840 --> 32:08.960
[Uhtred] They're coming.

32:10.400 --> 32:11.400
Get into position!

32:11.880 --> 32:13.040
[Rhodri] Follow me!

32:13.120 --> 32:14.560
Mercians to the woods!

32:14.640 --> 32:16.280
To the woods!

32:18.360 --> 32:20.280
[horn blows]

32:24.600 --> 32:27.160
[whispers] If this fails
and there is no escape for you...

32:28.200 --> 32:31.240
promise me you will find a man
you trust to kill you softly.

32:31.800 --> 32:33.560
I have already picked a man.

32:36.160 --> 32:41.040
[Danes yelling]

32:41.400 --> 32:43.360
[Finan] Be merciful to me, oh God!

32:44.240 --> 32:45.760
[yelling]

32:49.200 --> 32:51.520
[Finan]
When I am afraid, I will trust in You.

32:56.680 --> 32:59.240
In God whose word I praise.

32:59.320 --> 33:01.360
In God I trust.

33:01.440 --> 33:04.160

-[mouths]

33:04.840 --> 33:06.000
[yelling]

33:06.320 --> 33:08.440
What can a man do to me?

33:10.000 --> 33:11.040
Nothing.

33:12.080 --> 33:15.320
For you have delivered my soul from death

33:15.400 --> 33:17.760
and my feet from stumbling...

33:18.160 --> 33:20.800
that I may walk before God.

33:21.720 --> 33:22.880
Something isn’t right.

33:26.200 --> 33:28.280
[breathes heavily]

33:37.160 --> 33:40.720
-Die! Die!
-[Danes yell]

33:40.800 --> 33:43.800

-[Brida] No! Wait! Hold back!

[horse neighs]

33:55.480 --> 33:57.880

34:05.160 --> 34:07.120
[Uhtred] Now... charge!

34:07.200 --> 34:08.680

34:10.520 --> 34:11.520
With me!

It's a trick! [grunts]

[Cnut grunting]

35:05.400 --> 35:06.800

35:11.880 --> 35:13.080
[Cnut] Where is he?

35:14.600 --> 35:16.480
[Brida yells]

35:25.760 --> 35:27.400
[screams]

35:28.240 --> 35:29.360
[grunts]

35:30.200 --> 35:32.000
Give me your hand! Pull!

35:35.240 --> 35:36.800
[grunting]

35:39.560 --> 35:40.960
[arrows whistling]

35:50.080 --> 35:51.280
[grunts]

35:52.120 --> 35:53.200
Uhtred!

35:53.280 --> 35:57.560
Uhtred, I will cut you into pieces,
you murderous coward!

35:57.640 --> 36:00.240
[swords clanging]

36:04.040 --> 36:05.040
[gasps]

36:06.680 --> 36:07.880
[Dane grunts angrily]

36:09.520 --> 36:10.400
[Dane groans]

36:11.520 --> 36:12.600
Father!

36:12.680 --> 36:13.560
[grunts]

36:19.520 --> 36:23.560
No shame in having a Dane atop you,
but, honestly, I've seen prettier.

36:26.040 --> 36:27.720
The ridge, Father!

36:33.560 --> 36:35.120
It's Aethelred!

36:35.200 --> 36:36.440
Can they reach us?

36:41.960 --> 36:44.360
-[sword clang]
-[men yelling]

36:44.720 --> 36:46.320
Charge!

36:53.600 --> 36:55.480
-[Young Uhtred grunts]
-[Dane screams]

37:03.960 --> 37:05.640
Who fights alongside Aethelflaed?

37:05.960 --> 37:10.280
The Mercian fyrds, her husband,
even the Welsh.

37:13.640 --> 37:15.200
Christians united.

37:15.760 --> 37:17.880
And without Wessex to lead them forward.

37:17.960 --> 37:21.240
-[Aethelflaed yells]

[Aldhelm grunting]

37:27.560 --> 37:28.800
[grunts and gasps]

37:28.880 --> 37:30.400
[Dane] It’s the Lady Aethelflaed!

37:30.480 --> 37:32.200
-There she is!
-Surround her!

37:32.560 --> 37:33.960
There are too many of them.

37:34.040 --> 37:35.280
[Aldhelm pants]

37:35.360 --> 37:36.360
[Dane] Get her!

37:40.120 --> 37:41.200
[whispers] Aldhelm.

37:48.160 --> 37:49.120
[Aethelflaed sighs]

37:49.200 --> 37:51.680
Withdraw! You will not take her from us!

37:52.160 --> 37:53.760
You do not have the courage.

37:54.480 --> 37:55.800
Aldhelm, you must.

37:56.360 --> 37:57.760
Since you are Alfred's daughter,

37:57.840 --> 38:00.080
I'll let you choose
which of us humps you first.

38:00.160 --> 38:03.200
-Aldhelm, please.
-I can't. I can't.

38:05.000 --> 38:06.480
You Saxons have...

38:06.560 --> 38:07.880

Hold fast, men! Hold your lines!

39:16.640 --> 39:17.920
[yells]

39:20.080 --> 39:22.440
[Uhtred] They are fleeing to the forest!

39:22.880 --> 39:24.200
Stop them!

39:28.480 --> 39:29.360
Uhtred!

My Lord! My Lord!

40:11.080 --> 40:12.840

Push on, men... to victory!

40:21.600 --> 40:23.160
[yelling and groaning]

40:36.440 --> 40:37.440
[Cnut] Uhtred!

40:39.480 --> 40:40.320
Finally.

40:42.200 --> 40:43.040
Fight me.

40:43.960 --> 40:45.000
Fight me!

40:45.680 --> 40:46.680
[both grunting]

41:01.000 --> 41:02.200
Murderer!

41:18.240 --> 41:19.720
You killed my firstborn.

41:20.600 --> 41:24.680
You killed my boy! Why?

41:25.360 --> 41:27.560
It was fair revenge for Ragnar!

41:27.960 --> 41:29.160
Ragnar!

41:33.600 --> 41:37.160
Ragnar was weak...
and I needed him to die!

41:37.240 --> 41:39.600
But my son... my son was innocent!

41:40.720 --> 41:42.960
[both grunt]

41:43.040 --> 41:44.280
[Cnut pants]

41:45.480 --> 41:46.480
Brida...

41:46.560 --> 41:47.880
[Cnut grunts and gasps]

41:49.000 --> 41:50.320
Give me your seax!

41:51.040 --> 41:51.880
[gags and gasps]

41:53.400 --> 41:54.920
Give me your seax!

[grunts and groans]

42:06.640 --> 42:08.920
[gasps and coughs]

42:15.560 --> 42:17.560
You sent Aethelwold to kill Ragnar?

42:20.360 --> 42:21.240
Because...

42:22.200 --> 42:25.480
Because we're destined to be together.
You know this.

42:27.280 --> 42:28.800
Please, my love.

42:28.880 --> 42:31.440
[Brida yells angrily]

[groans]

42:43.360 --> 42:44.560
Your boys live.

42:46.560 --> 42:50.360
The body your man saw was a Mercian,
killed by Danish hands.

42:51.000 --> 42:54.280
-[Cnut] Both... both survive?
-[Uhtred] Both.

42:55.840 --> 42:57.960
But you will not live
to see them grow old.

42:59.960 --> 43:01.440
[Cnut gasps for breath]

43:01.520 --> 43:03.520

43:03.600 --> 43:05.200
You should not have trusted him.

-[man] Keep up!

43:41.680 --> 43:43.160
[whimpers]

43:53.360 --> 43:54.920
Send me to Valhalla.

43:55.000 --> 43:58.880
[breathes heavily]

43:58.960 --> 44:00.640
They will take you as a prisoner.

44:00.720 --> 44:05.240
That’s worse than death.
Please, I cannot be a slave.

44:06.440 --> 44:08.800
Let me die with honor
here on the battlefield.

44:09.760 --> 44:11.760
You owe me that, Uhtred.

44:13.760 --> 44:16.320
I want to be with Ragnar.
Please, Uhtred.

44:18.000 --> 44:18.880
[softly] Please.

44:21.640 --> 44:23.200
[Rhodri] Take the pagan bitch!

44:27.600 --> 44:28.440
[whimpers]

44:28.600 --> 44:29.560
[Uhtred] Brida.

44:55.920 --> 44:59.880
King Hywel,
you have done all Christians proud.

45:00.360 --> 45:01.840
It is an honor to meet you.

45:01.920 --> 45:04.720
And I am pleased
you were able to make the battle, Lord.

45:05.880 --> 45:08.440
Well, we would not have won
without you and your men.

45:08.960 --> 45:10.400
I am most grateful.

45:10.480 --> 45:13.440
And your generous rewards are appreciated.

45:14.360 --> 45:18.160
Your priest conveyed to me
your kind offer of the spoils of battle.

45:21.560 --> 45:25.160
Of course.
It is the least your bravery deserves.

45:25.240 --> 45:27.440
May it strengthen our new union.

45:28.360 --> 45:30.160
As we are united in faith...

45:31.000 --> 45:35.120
let us be united in prosperity
and security!

45:35.200 --> 45:36.640
[men cheering]

45:36.720 --> 45:39.280
I promise you, we shall feast tonight!

45:39.360 --> 45:42.320
[cheering]

45:42.600 --> 45:46.640
There will be no alliance
and no more favors.

45:47.720 --> 45:50.320
The people of Wealas
do not need Saxon help.

46:26.000 --> 46:27.440
The Lord favored us.

46:29.160 --> 46:31.360
I've just sent Brida to her doom.

46:31.440 --> 46:33.280
-It is battle.
-[pants]

46:33.360 --> 46:36.440
What matters is we both survived
and Mercia is safe.

46:40.280 --> 46:41.840
-[man] My Lord King.
-[man] My Lord.

46:42.360 --> 46:43.200
[man] Sire.

46:43.840 --> 46:44.800
My Lord...

46:44.880 --> 46:47.640
-He dares to walk amongst the fallen?
-Do not.

46:48.200 --> 46:49.800
There has been enough fighting.

46:51.000 --> 46:52.200
Your men need you.

47:09.000 --> 47:13.400
Lady, the triumph is all yours.

47:14.080 --> 47:17.040
You led us to a great victory
they will speak of for years to come.

47:17.120 --> 47:19.480
And I thank you I am alive to see it.

47:20.800 --> 47:22.840
I probably wasn't the man for that task.

47:28.120 --> 47:30.400
Edward, thank you.

47:31.520 --> 47:33.760
If it were not for you,
I would be amongst the dead.

47:34.080 --> 47:36.000
I came despite my better judgment.

47:37.240 --> 47:39.800
I do not take your defiance lightly.

47:40.600 --> 47:44.160
-Yes, but surely it was a great victory.
-With a great loss of many men.

47:46.200 --> 47:47.520
Steapa is dead.

47:49.400 --> 47:50.680
-No.
-Yes.

47:51.120 --> 47:54.280
The man who has stood
since our childhood like a giant oak.

47:54.600 --> 47:56.400
He stood with our father, then with us.

47:56.480 --> 47:59.320
Now he's been taken
in a battle of your making,

47:59.400 --> 48:01.720
sacrificed for your husband's ambition
and for yours.

48:02.040 --> 48:03.640
No, I have no ambition.

48:03.720 --> 48:05.280
You seek to be loved by all...

48:06.560 --> 48:10.160
chronicled for your bravery,
no matter if it costs the blood of men.

48:11.600 --> 48:13.960
-That is not true.
-Yes, it is.

48:14.440 --> 48:17.440
You've chosen Mercia
over the kingdom of Alfred.

48:18.760 --> 48:21.400
I suggest you do not return south
for a long time.

48:22.640 --> 48:24.840
You should not exile me from Winchester.

48:24.920 --> 48:27.840
I fear you would not be welcome there,
Lady.

48:29.720 --> 48:32.520
The widows of these men
will not forgive you easily.

48:33.200 --> 48:39.000
Still, you may receive
adoration in this place.

48:40.200 --> 48:43.000
It may be some compensation.

48:44.440 --> 48:47.880
None of this was done for anything
but love of my country!

48:52.320 --> 48:54.360
Come away from this place, Lord King.

49:02.200 --> 49:03.960
I have been made to look a fool...

49:04.880 --> 49:08.320
unable to reward my own men,
paying tribute to the Welsh.

49:10.000 --> 49:11.400
This will be made right.

49:12.560 --> 49:15.120
What excuses did he make
for his cowardice?

49:16.760 --> 49:19.120
He wanted to avoid bloodshed for his men.

49:19.600 --> 49:21.200
Which created more bloodshed.

49:22.200 --> 49:23.960
-I have to speak with him.
-No!

49:24.560 --> 49:25.800
At least not now.

49:27.240 --> 49:30.200
The Danes are defeated.
Let us just enjoy the peace...

49:31.320 --> 49:32.880
just for one night.

49:37.040 --> 49:38.600
I will do as you ask...

49:40.800 --> 49:42.280
just for one night.

50:02.040 --> 50:04.240
Let us go, take advantage of the chaos.

50:04.320 --> 50:07.880
-He can believe you died in battle.
-No. I have half killed myself fighting.

50:07.960 --> 50:10.960
[pants] I will find him
and I will beg him.

50:11.040 --> 50:14.800
He will never forgive us for what
we have done. It is over for us, brother.

50:14.880 --> 50:17.680
[soldier] Clear a path! Move! Stand aside!

50:23.600 --> 50:25.960
Lord Aethelred is wounded. Fetch a healer!
