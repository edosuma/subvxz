01:47.800 --> 01:49.689
Can you just listen up?

01:50.360 --> 01:51.486
Guys?

01:52.840 --> 01:56.765
We got 2,000 feet, 600 vertical meters

01:57.320 --> 01:58.810
to Camp Four.

01:59.440 --> 02:03.411
It's roped all the way,
so I know you can make it.

02:04.040 --> 02:06.561
Once we get to the yellow band,
we're gonna regroup,

02:07.200 --> 02:09.860
put on the masks, turn on the gas.

02:09.960 --> 02:11.610
Make sense?

03:03.600 --> 03:06.060
325 dollars a bottle.

03:06.160 --> 03:07.140
For oxygen?

03:07.240 --> 03:08.380
That's daylight robbery!

03:08.480 --> 03:10.780
Yeah, well, he's cornered
the market, he's got it.

03:10.880 --> 03:13.804
He reckons there's gonna be 20 teams
at Base Camp this season.

03:13.920 --> 03:14.860
Twenty teams?

03:14.960 --> 03:18.841
I mean, with all the Sherpas and porters,
it's gonna be a squeeze up there.

03:19.320 --> 03:21.900
Well, that's a scrum on
the ropes, right there.

03:22.000 --> 03:24.100
- What is this?
- It's Helen's.

03:24.200 --> 03:26.260
It's a little decoration
for the mess tent.

03:26.360 --> 03:27.340
You can wear them in your hair.

03:27.440 --> 03:28.441
I'll have that. Thank you.

03:28.560 --> 03:30.403
Okay, I got some news.

03:31.000 --> 03:32.860
We got Krakauer.

03:32.960 --> 03:34.780
You stole him from Scott Fischer?

03:34.880 --> 03:36.211
No, he made up his own mind.

03:36.320 --> 03:37.731
Good job, Rob!

03:38.360 --> 03:40.700
How much is he paying you, Rob?

03:40.800 --> 03:43.140
Well, he's only paying for his airfare

03:43.240 --> 03:46.220
but we get 5,000 words in the magazine

03:46.320 --> 03:48.100
and our picture on the front cover. Huh?

03:48.200 --> 03:50.780
That makes it all worthwhile.
Right there.

03:50.880 --> 03:52.180
Well, if you get him to the top.

03:52.280 --> 03:53.460
If?

03:53.560 --> 03:55.260
If? How can you say that to me?

03:55.360 --> 03:56.460
There you go. You all right?

03:56.560 --> 03:58.140
Thanks, Guy. Cheers, mate.

03:58.240 --> 03:59.844
- Hey!
- Hello!

04:01.240 --> 04:03.100
- You all right?
- Oh, yeah, how are you?

04:03.200 --> 04:04.565
- Me? I'm good.
- Oh, look at you!

04:04.680 --> 04:06.580
I know, I'm big.

04:06.680 --> 04:08.580
- Here you go.
- You good?

04:08.680 --> 04:10.540
Yeah, you know, I'm just gonna miss you.

04:10.640 --> 04:11.846
Come on.

04:14.720 --> 04:16.563
- Let's go, Guy.
- Mmm-hmm.

04:17.079 --> 04:19.740
Just go careful, all right?

04:19.839 --> 04:21.329
- It's...
- Please, my love.

04:21.839 --> 04:23.683
Come on. Please don't worry.

04:23.800 --> 04:27.051
It's just the doing nothing back here
that's making me worry.

04:27.160 --> 04:28.140
You're not doing nothing.

04:28.240 --> 04:29.500
No, but...

04:29.600 --> 04:30.726
What?

04:31.280 --> 04:33.123
It's the waiting for you.

04:33.680 --> 04:35.842
- For him.
- Her.

04:35.960 --> 04:37.405
- Her.
- Her.

04:40.200 --> 04:42.885
Just be back for the birth, Rob Hall.

04:44.280 --> 04:46.044
You try and stop me.

04:46.480 --> 04:50.940
This is a final call for Air New Zealand
Flight 7419 to Kathmandu.

04:51.040 --> 04:53.260
- Okay, I love you.
- Go, or I'll cry.

04:53.360 --> 04:54.600
Go.

05:18.960 --> 05:20.086
Yeah.

05:20.600 --> 05:21.726
That all you got?

05:21.840 --> 05:23.126
Yeah, that's it.

05:23.600 --> 05:25.568
I think we're over here.

05:33.920 --> 05:36.220
Hey, what outfit you guys with?

05:36.320 --> 05:37.321
Uh, Adventure Consultants.

05:37.440 --> 05:38.500
Ah, good. Me too.

05:38.600 --> 05:39.700
- Ah.
- I'm Beck.

05:39.800 --> 05:41.643
- Beck Weathers.
- Doug Hansen.

05:42.160 --> 05:43.820
- Jon Krakauer.
- How you doing?

05:43.920 --> 05:45.420
- Good.
- Are you, uh...

05:45.520 --> 05:48.220
- Krakauer from Outside magazine?
- Yep.

05:48.320 --> 05:49.380
Really?

05:49.480 --> 05:51.540
What are you doing?
Writing or climbing or what?

05:51.640 --> 05:53.780
- Little bit of both.
- Hmm.

05:53.880 --> 05:56.420
Well, I'll let you know
how the summit goes, okay?

05:56.520 --> 05:58.260
No need. I'll be there.

05:58.360 --> 05:59.691
Ah, we'll see.

06:15.520 --> 06:17.780
What do you do when
you're not climbing, Doug?

06:17.880 --> 06:19.769
- What, for work?
- Yeah.

06:20.080 --> 06:22.580
Uh, different things.
Carpenter, mailman.

06:22.680 --> 06:24.540
Carpenter, mailman?

06:24.640 --> 06:25.620
Yep.

06:25.720 --> 06:27.020
Seriously, you deliver the mail?

06:27.120 --> 06:28.645
Yeah, I deliver the mail.

06:30.320 --> 06:31.700
Mailman on Everest?

06:31.800 --> 06:33.300
Hope so.

06:33.400 --> 06:35.420
I like that.

06:35.520 --> 06:37.284
Mailman on Everest.

06:45.600 --> 06:46.580
There we go.

06:46.680 --> 06:47.980
- Beck.
- Yeah?

06:48.080 --> 06:50.380
You know he made it to the South
Summit on Everest last year?

06:50.480 --> 06:52.528
- Who, Doug did?
- Yeah.

06:52.640 --> 06:54.700
That's pretty high for a mailman.

06:54.800 --> 06:58.247
Yep. Longs Peak, McKinley.

06:58.800 --> 07:01.500
I never made it up to
the top of McKinley myself.

07:01.600 --> 07:03.620
- I know.
- Well, how do you know that?

07:03.720 --> 07:05.085
'89, right?

07:05.600 --> 07:06.886
Oh!

07:07.080 --> 07:08.580
You've done your research.

07:08.680 --> 07:10.330
That's what we do.

07:18.200 --> 07:21.620
You, my friends, are following
in some very famous footsteps.

07:21.720 --> 07:23.768
A history made famous by George Everest,

07:23.880 --> 07:26.780
George Mallory, Tenzing Norgay,
Edmund Hillary.

07:26.880 --> 07:28.340
And Rob Hall!

07:31.720 --> 07:33.210
Legends all of them!

07:34.480 --> 07:35.970
That's right.

07:36.720 --> 07:38.404
For those of you who
dare face their dreams,

07:38.520 --> 07:42.940
Adventure Consultants offers something
beyond the power of words to describe.

07:43.040 --> 07:46.408
And why don't we describe it
in the brochure?

07:47.120 --> 07:49.100
Because it's mostly just pain.

07:49.200 --> 07:50.700
- Yes.
- Ain't that the truth?

07:50.800 --> 07:54.722
And the odd, if you don't mind,
Mike, and the odd missing toe.

07:56.240 --> 07:57.366
There we go.

07:59.240 --> 08:03.500
To put it simply, guys, human beings
simply aren't built to function

08:03.600 --> 08:07.241
at the cruising altitude of a 747.

08:07.680 --> 08:10.940
Okay, once we get above here,
above the South Col

08:11.040 --> 08:12.300
our bodies will be literally dying.

08:12.400 --> 08:14.340
And I mean literally dying.

08:14.440 --> 08:16.340
It's not called the Death Zone
for nothing, guys.

08:16.440 --> 08:17.441
So the game is,

08:17.800 --> 08:21.820
can we get you up to the top
and down to the bottom

08:21.920 --> 08:23.260
before that happens?

08:23.360 --> 08:25.089
- You sure can.
- Oh!

08:25.240 --> 08:27.060
Beck Weathers, ladies and gentlemen.

08:27.160 --> 08:29.540
You might have noticed
a bit of the Lone Star State?

08:29.640 --> 08:31.165
100% Texan right here, people.

08:31.280 --> 08:33.282
100% Texan.

08:34.240 --> 08:36.082
You've met Mike Groom.

08:36.600 --> 08:38.500
I'd like to introduce you
to Andy Harris.

08:38.600 --> 08:40.179
- Harold.
- Our other guide out of Queenstown.

08:40.280 --> 08:42.340
Taranaki, actually, originally. Kia Ora.

08:42.440 --> 08:45.020
Helen and the rest of the team
are already on the way up to Base Camp.

08:45.120 --> 08:47.300
They're setting it up
for when we get there.

08:47.400 --> 08:48.820
Today's March 30, people.

08:48.920 --> 08:50.900
I plan on going for the summit May 10.

08:51.000 --> 08:53.500
It's been a lucky day for me
and Adventure Consultants

08:53.600 --> 08:55.980
and the weather's usually
pretty stable around then.

08:56.080 --> 08:57.220
So that means,

08:57.320 --> 09:02.220
we have 40 days to train your bodies
and your minds to go for it.

09:02.320 --> 09:05.369
Now, I know there's a lot of
mountaineering experience in this room.

09:05.480 --> 09:06.820
You wouldn't be here without it.

09:06.920 --> 09:09.860
Stu, K2, Broad Peak.

09:09.960 --> 09:10.900
John Taske.

09:11.000 --> 09:13.500
1,192 meters of Mount Kosciuszko.

09:14.960 --> 09:17.486
And... I mean, Yasuko Namba.

09:17.600 --> 09:20.060
Six of the Seven Summits and the only woman.

09:20.160 --> 09:21.100
There you go.

09:21.200 --> 09:22.700
- Let's make it seven.
- Thank you.

09:22.800 --> 09:26.340
But Everest, though, is another beast,
another beast altogether.

09:26.440 --> 09:28.220
That's why you're here,
isn't that right, Dougie?

09:28.320 --> 09:30.721
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

09:31.400 --> 09:34.540
So, listen. Tonight, that's it from me.
Eat, drink, be merry.

09:34.640 --> 09:36.005
Tomorrow, we trek.

09:38.680 --> 09:40.620
- We good?
- You ready for this?

09:42.480 --> 09:43.845
Dougie.

09:44.720 --> 09:46.580
All right, folks, hang on.

09:46.680 --> 09:47.660
Okay.

09:47.760 --> 09:50.420
- That's it, here we go, Colonel.
- All right, everybody, earbuds.

09:50.520 --> 09:52.500
Take your seats, buckle in, everyone.

09:52.600 --> 09:53.601
Thanks, Mike.

09:54.520 --> 09:56.420
Do or die. Here we go.

09:56.520 --> 09:57.681
Okay.

09:58.960 --> 10:00.140
Can you believe it?

10:00.240 --> 10:03.449
Bravo 270 en route, request Bravo 410.

10:33.600 --> 10:34.780
Keep 'em all in a nice group.

10:34.880 --> 10:36.006
Hey, guys, take it easy.

10:37.240 --> 10:38.700
- Yes, I'm ready.
- Ready.

10:38.800 --> 10:40.500
We're kicking it off, let's go.

10:40.600 --> 10:42.443
You lead the way, pal.

10:43.280 --> 10:44.500
You all right?

10:44.600 --> 10:45.726
Yes.

11:19.960 --> 11:22.180
Guys, man wants to see
your climbing permits.

11:22.280 --> 11:24.380
Need to see all your climbing permits!

11:24.480 --> 11:26.660
Namaste.

11:26.760 --> 11:28.340
Thank you very much,
we'll see you on the way back.

11:28.440 --> 11:30.090
Thank you very much.

11:30.200 --> 11:32.340
- All good?
- Yeah, yeah. Yeah, you?

11:32.440 --> 11:34.010
- Yeah.
- Hey, uh...

11:34.800 --> 11:36.245
Thanks, Rob.

11:36.680 --> 11:37.900
Thanks for what?

11:38.000 --> 11:39.604
You know, the discount.

11:40.840 --> 11:43.260
Well, you're working three jobs, Doug.

11:43.360 --> 11:44.340
It was the least I could do, mate.

11:44.440 --> 11:47.887
I know, you didn't have to do it,
though, and I appreciate it.

11:49.600 --> 11:51.220
Let's just get you to the top this time.

11:51.320 --> 11:52.606
Yeah.

12:03.240 --> 12:05.129
How you feeling, Beck?

12:05.960 --> 12:07.380
Fair to middling.

12:07.480 --> 12:09.340
Come on, buddy, you can do it.

12:09.440 --> 12:11.124
Thought I was gonna acclimatize
faster than this.

12:11.440 --> 12:13.660
Uh, you'll be all right.

12:16.160 --> 12:17.650
Darn critters.

12:33.120 --> 12:34.121
Whoo!

12:35.560 --> 12:37.403
- Wow.
- Yeah.

12:43.080 --> 12:44.460
How close did you get?

12:44.560 --> 12:47.740
Well, I got real close
but it got late and I was

12:47.840 --> 12:49.604
pretty shot anyways.

12:50.680 --> 12:52.887
Well, I think I would
have made a run for it.

12:53.000 --> 12:54.300
Every day I wake up thinking that.

12:54.400 --> 12:55.900
Then why didn't you do it?

12:56.000 --> 12:57.331
'Cause I turned him around.

12:58.240 --> 13:00.860
Morning 15 at the South Summit,
bad conditions,

13:00.960 --> 13:03.540
we weren't gonna make
our 2:00 p.m. turnaround.

13:03.640 --> 13:05.260
See, it's all good and well
to make the top, Beck,

13:05.360 --> 13:07.700
but you pay me to bring you down safely.

13:07.800 --> 13:09.529
Remember that.

13:10.600 --> 13:11.726
Okay.

13:21.080 --> 13:22.764
What's eating him?

13:23.600 --> 13:26.220
One of our Sherpas, Tenzing.
He had an accident.

13:26.320 --> 13:28.084
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

13:28.640 --> 13:30.500
Fell while fixing one
of the ladders on the Icefall.

13:30.600 --> 13:33.729
It's not good.
They had to bring him down.

14:14.960 --> 14:16.246
Namaste.

14:20.600 --> 14:21.601
Namaste.

15:18.680 --> 15:22.180
Congratulations, you all made it.
Welcome to Base Camp!

15:22.280 --> 15:24.248
We got the United
Nations here this year.

15:24.360 --> 15:26.840
Got the IMAX team, South Africans.

15:29.320 --> 15:30.924
And right up here

15:32.480 --> 15:34.369
in the best spot of all

15:35.120 --> 15:36.963
we have the Adventure
Consultants Base Camp.

15:37.080 --> 15:39.401
- Hey, Helen.
- Hey. Hi, how are you?

15:39.520 --> 15:42.500
- Good to see you. Thank you.
- Welcome, nice to see you.

15:42.600 --> 15:43.620
- Hi, Rob.
- Hey.

15:43.720 --> 15:45.300
Well done, you all right?

15:45.400 --> 15:46.420
Yeah, good. You?

15:46.520 --> 15:49.020
- Yeah, no, we're good.
- It looks good.

15:49.120 --> 15:51.420
For those of you that haven't met,
this is Helen Wilton,

15:51.520 --> 15:52.860
Base Camp manager.

15:52.960 --> 15:56.487
She will be your mom
for the next few weeks.

15:56.600 --> 15:58.443
Any problems, take it to
her and she'll sort it.

15:58.560 --> 16:00.820
All right, well, it's very nice

16:00.920 --> 16:02.570
to finally meet you all in person.

16:02.680 --> 16:04.100
Ang Dorjee, come here.

16:04.200 --> 16:05.860
This is Ang Dorjee, everyone.

16:05.960 --> 16:08.645
He's your climbing sirdar,
your lead Sherpa.

16:09.160 --> 16:10.740
Hey, how are ya?

16:10.840 --> 16:11.940
You speak English?

16:12.040 --> 16:15.249
Better than you, Mr. America.

16:15.360 --> 16:17.840
- Bet you climb better than I do, huh?
- Yeah.

16:18.520 --> 16:19.601
Yeah?

16:20.520 --> 16:21.885
Summited three times, Beck.

16:22.000 --> 16:23.380
All right, all right.
I hear ya, I hear ya.

16:23.480 --> 16:27.727
All right, well, there's tea in the mess
tent when you've dumped your sacks

16:28.280 --> 16:31.980
and the comms tent's down the back,
that's the cooking tent, and over there

16:32.080 --> 16:33.570
is the toilet.

16:34.120 --> 16:37.660
It's a little bit drafty,
but just remember that

16:37.760 --> 16:41.760
when the wind gets up here, you've got
the same view that George Everest did.

16:49.480 --> 16:51.500
For those of you
who haven't used crampons before

16:51.600 --> 16:54.460
the left and rights are marked with an "L"
and an "R," so you can't get it wrong.

16:54.560 --> 16:55.940
All right? So, simple.

16:56.040 --> 16:59.442
First of all, you push it
into the shoe with this.

16:59.920 --> 17:01.660
Unbelievable.

17:01.760 --> 17:04.420
If it isn't the mayor of Base Camp!

17:04.520 --> 17:07.364
Scott Fischer, Mr. Mountain Madness.

17:08.599 --> 17:09.660
In the flesh.

17:09.760 --> 17:11.220
You want a cup?

17:11.319 --> 17:14.642
Sit down, man. Acclimatize!

17:15.280 --> 17:18.365
Okay. I'm normally a tea man myself,
but let's give it a go.

17:18.960 --> 17:20.644
Thank you so much.

17:26.160 --> 17:27.969
Wow. It's crazy this year, eh?

17:28.800 --> 17:29.860
I know, man.

17:29.960 --> 17:32.540
Some idiot Kiwi goes and invents
Himalayan guiding

17:32.640 --> 17:34.780
and look what happens.

17:34.880 --> 17:37.460
Yeah, it didn't take you too long
to get in on the act.

17:37.560 --> 17:39.562
Gotta make a living, man.

17:41.680 --> 17:43.820
You went ahead and fixed
the icefalls, I see.

17:43.920 --> 17:45.001
Yeah, yeah.

17:45.120 --> 17:46.620
- It's pretty messy up there this year.
- Yeah?

17:46.720 --> 17:48.180
Crevasses are pretty big.

17:48.280 --> 17:50.220
Strung four or five ladders across.

17:50.320 --> 17:53.005
You used good ropes though, didn't you?

17:53.640 --> 17:54.780
You ready? Okay.

17:54.880 --> 17:58.100
This is, um, April 7th,
about 10:30 a.m.,

17:58.200 --> 18:01.442
this is Sandy Hill Pittman,
reporting for NBC Interactive Media

18:01.600 --> 18:04.206
and we are officially at Everest Base Camp!

18:04.800 --> 18:06.460
- She one of yours?
- Oh, yeah.

18:06.560 --> 18:08.420
Someone went and stole my journalist

18:08.520 --> 18:10.460
- so I had to get another one.
- Hmm.

18:10.560 --> 18:13.060
She's a lot easier on the eye
than Jon Krakauer,

18:13.160 --> 18:14.340
- that's for sure.
- Listen, just to be clear,

18:14.440 --> 18:15.460
I didn't steal your journalist.

18:15.560 --> 18:16.580
Hey, man, it's all good.

18:16.680 --> 18:18.980
Outside magazine gave me a call.

18:19.080 --> 18:20.580
- Hey. Hey!
- They gave me a call.

18:20.680 --> 18:22.660
- Said they wanted to...
- It's all good, man.

18:22.760 --> 18:27.363
They were gonna send a journalist up
the hill and asked me if I was interested.

18:27.960 --> 18:30.042
It was his call in the end.

18:40.440 --> 18:41.980
All right, Caroline MacKenzie,
team doctor.

18:42.080 --> 18:43.580
Why don't you kick it off, Caro.

18:43.680 --> 18:45.409
- Hi, everyone.
- Hey, Caro.

18:45.520 --> 18:46.760
Hi there.

18:48.280 --> 18:50.442
- Sorry.
- That's fine.

18:50.560 --> 18:51.561
Um...

18:51.880 --> 18:53.940
So Rob and Harold and Mike will tell you

18:54.040 --> 18:58.168
all sorts of stuff about mountaineering,
but from a medical standpoint

18:58.280 --> 19:01.780
getting you to the top of Everest
is really about oxygen.

19:01.880 --> 19:03.500
And the lack of it.

19:03.600 --> 19:05.460
To give you the best chance of summiting

19:05.560 --> 19:08.850
you need to prepare your bodies
for the thin air up there.

19:08.960 --> 19:11.580
So, over the next month,
before the final ascent

19:11.680 --> 19:14.580
you're gonna make three
partial acclimatizing ascents

19:14.680 --> 19:16.921
returning here to
Base Camp after each one.

19:17.640 --> 19:21.443
The bad news is that each ascent
begins and ends with the Icefall.

19:22.080 --> 19:25.140
I'm sorry, but there
is no way around it.

19:25.240 --> 19:29.500
There are millions of tons of glacial
ice continually moving day and night.

19:29.600 --> 19:31.540
You got seracs the size of tower blocks,

19:31.640 --> 19:35.247
you got crevasses so deep they
probably don't even have a bottom.

19:35.360 --> 19:37.740
It is not a place that you wanna
get caught hanging out in,

19:37.840 --> 19:39.500
especially when the sun hits it.

19:39.600 --> 19:43.087
So we're gonna be up nice and early
and through that as soon as possible.

19:43.200 --> 19:45.860
Now the Sherpas have gone ahead and
fixed the ladders across the crevasses

19:45.960 --> 19:48.300
and we've made it as
safe as we possibly can.

19:48.400 --> 19:50.607
But that is not to say
that it is completely safe.

19:51.240 --> 19:53.971
19 people have died in that Icefall.

19:54.560 --> 19:56.961
Whoa! Whoa! Hold on!

19:58.160 --> 19:59.460
Steady.

19:59.560 --> 20:00.740
You all right, Jon?

20:00.840 --> 20:02.420
You all right?

20:02.520 --> 20:03.780
- I'm good.
- Okay.

20:03.880 --> 20:05.660
- All right, steady up.
- Whoo!

20:05.760 --> 20:08.300
So remember, we're a team.

20:08.400 --> 20:10.004
Let's look out for each other.

20:11.360 --> 20:15.891
Look out for hypothermia, things like
slurred speech and irrational behavior.

20:16.840 --> 20:20.260
I've seen hypoxic climbers rip off
all their clothes at 8,000 meters

20:20.360 --> 20:22.488
because they're feeling hot.

20:23.880 --> 20:26.660
You all know about cerebral edema,
the swelling of your brain

20:26.760 --> 20:29.969
to the point of loss of motor function
and eventually death.

20:31.560 --> 20:34.803
And pulmonary edema,
which is your lungs filling with fluid

20:34.920 --> 20:36.900
so you effectively drown.

20:37.000 --> 20:39.685
The only cure is to get
down the mountain, fast.

20:40.440 --> 20:41.980
- All right, okay.
- All right, buddy.

20:42.080 --> 20:44.500
But it is not all doom
and gloom here, okay?

20:44.600 --> 20:48.300
Myself and the whole AC team are here
to make sure you get up and down safely

20:48.400 --> 20:51.100
and you will acclimatize naturally.

20:51.200 --> 20:55.326
So why don't we all give Caro a nice big
thank you, it's her first time here.

20:56.160 --> 20:58.367
- All right.
- Nice job.

21:09.400 --> 21:10.731
Well done.

21:11.080 --> 21:12.889
See, you want to get on the regulator.

21:13.000 --> 21:14.047
You want to hear that hiss.

21:16.520 --> 21:17.580
Connect your hose.

21:17.680 --> 21:19.580
- Yasuko.
- Beck.

21:19.680 --> 21:21.100
- How'd you do, darling?
- Okay.

21:21.200 --> 21:22.780
- Good?
- Well done.

21:22.880 --> 21:25.980
- Can I get a hit of that?
- Have a suck on that.

21:26.080 --> 21:29.780
In a situation like this, you just wanna
catch your breath, throw it up to four.

21:29.880 --> 21:31.900
- You should start feeling pretty good.
- I can feel it already.

21:32.000 --> 21:33.500
How did you boys go?

21:33.600 --> 21:34.940
- Hey.
- Instant happiness.

21:35.040 --> 21:37.088
- It's amazing.
- Very happy.

21:41.000 --> 21:42.729
Doug, you okay?

21:43.200 --> 21:46.807
When we get back to Base, I want you
to get Caro to take a look at you.

21:46.920 --> 21:48.843
- No. I'm all right, I'm okay.
- No, no.

21:49.440 --> 21:51.010
And do me a favor,
spend your night on oxygen.

21:51.120 --> 21:52.300
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

21:52.400 --> 21:53.380
We got enough?

21:53.480 --> 21:55.369
- We got plenty.
- All right.

21:57.400 --> 21:59.607
Get some tea into ya.

22:00.240 --> 22:02.060
Just lift your shirt up a bit.

22:02.160 --> 22:03.491
Thank you.

22:06.640 --> 22:08.563
And take a deep breath for me?

22:14.920 --> 22:17.660
Just take one of those in the morning
with a bit of water, before breakfast.

22:17.760 --> 22:19.489
Okay, thanks.

22:19.600 --> 22:22.763
- Right, Beck, you're up.
- Sorry. Here, go for it.

22:24.440 --> 22:26.090
Read it and weep.

22:26.640 --> 22:28.483
Take it easy, Doug.

22:31.720 --> 22:33.420
- Right, you can stop.
- Yeah?

22:33.520 --> 22:34.500
You're in great shape, Beck.

22:34.600 --> 22:35.601
I am in great shape.

22:36.040 --> 22:37.940
- You are.
- Six days a week in the gym.

22:38.040 --> 22:40.180
- Ought to do it.
- Your wife must love that.

22:40.280 --> 22:41.281
Yeah, she does.

22:42.640 --> 22:45.020
Oh, no. What's the date today?

22:45.120 --> 22:46.060
April 25th.

22:46.160 --> 22:48.891
No!

22:53.520 --> 22:56.300
I need to send a message to my wife.
Can I use your fax?

22:56.400 --> 22:57.580
You might wanna look at this one first.

22:57.680 --> 23:00.001
It came in for you last night.

23:04.200 --> 23:06.043
- Lord.
- What?

23:07.920 --> 23:10.220
- Can I use your sat phone?
- Ooh!

23:10.320 --> 23:12.780
Well, if this did come in last night,
it's an emergency.

23:12.880 --> 23:14.460
It's 25 bucks a minute, Beck.

23:14.560 --> 23:15.620
Yep, fine.

23:15.720 --> 23:16.960
No, this one's on us.

23:17.080 --> 23:18.620
Seriously?

23:18.720 --> 23:19.960
Thanks.

23:21.480 --> 23:22.561
Rob!

23:24.280 --> 23:26.780
- Beck?
- Peach, it's me.

23:26.880 --> 23:28.340
What's happened?

23:28.440 --> 23:29.965
Nothing, nothing. I'm fine.

23:30.640 --> 23:32.165
Where are you?

23:32.480 --> 23:35.900
Uh, I'm at Base Camp right now.

23:36.000 --> 23:37.900
You're calling me from Everest?

23:38.000 --> 23:39.780
Yeah, it's a satellite phone, honey.

23:39.880 --> 23:43.220
Oh, my God, how much is that costing?
What's the problem?

23:43.320 --> 23:44.620
There is no problem, Peach.

23:44.720 --> 23:45.721
Uh...

23:46.680 --> 23:48.260
I'm sorry, we were up at Camp Two

23:48.360 --> 23:51.523
and that's why I didn't
send you a fax yesterday.

23:53.000 --> 23:55.810
Happy anniversary! Okay?

23:58.080 --> 23:59.140
How are the kids?

23:59.240 --> 24:00.366
Fine.

24:01.160 --> 24:02.100
Peach?

24:02.200 --> 24:03.531
Bub's here

24:05.040 --> 24:07.780
doing his homework
in the morning, as per usual.

24:07.880 --> 24:08.860
You wanna say hi to him?

24:08.960 --> 24:10.580
Well, yeah, of course I do.

24:10.680 --> 24:11.740
- Hang on.
- Okay.

24:11.840 --> 24:12.940
- Say hi.
- Hey, Dad!

24:13.040 --> 24:14.020
- Hey, bud!
- Hi!

24:14.120 --> 24:15.724
I miss you, buddy.

24:16.240 --> 24:18.340
Oh! And Meg went on her
first date last weekend.

24:19.560 --> 24:21.060
Well, you did!

24:21.160 --> 24:23.208
- Wow! Really?
- Mmm-hmm.

24:23.720 --> 24:25.404
- Get off!
- Peach?

24:28.360 --> 24:30.380
I miss you, honey.

24:30.480 --> 24:32.460
Mom? Mom?

24:32.560 --> 24:34.210
I miss the kids.

24:36.040 --> 24:37.246
A lot.

24:39.320 --> 24:40.300
Peach?

24:40.400 --> 24:43.300
Listen, I gotta get the kids to school

24:43.400 --> 24:45.129
so I gotta run.

24:47.080 --> 24:48.020
Okay.

24:48.120 --> 24:49.121
Yeah, go careful.

24:49.960 --> 24:51.041
Bye-bye.

24:54.520 --> 24:56.090
Is Dad okay?

24:57.920 --> 24:59.763
Just, he never calls.

25:01.400 --> 25:03.209
I think he's scared.

25:15.920 --> 25:18.241
Here, come in, mate, come on!

25:18.960 --> 25:21.088
- Come on.
- Come on, Beck.

25:22.440 --> 25:24.660
You don't dance, you don't climb!

25:24.760 --> 25:27.001
Come on, guys, Beck Weathers!

25:28.960 --> 25:32.282
No dance, no climb! No dance, no climb!

25:41.480 --> 25:43.780
Hey, man. Breaking into the rations?

25:43.880 --> 25:44.881
Yeah, you want some?

25:45.640 --> 25:47.961
No. I'll wait till we summit.

25:49.680 --> 25:52.206
I don't know about that, Neal.

25:52.840 --> 25:54.700
We'll get there.

25:54.800 --> 25:55.820
I'm excited.

25:55.920 --> 25:59.410
Anyway, me and Anatoli
are here to help you, you know?

26:01.640 --> 26:04.325
There's too much competition, Toli.

26:07.360 --> 26:10.204
We don't need competition
between people.

26:13.600 --> 26:17.571
There is competition between
every person and this mountain.

26:20.680 --> 26:24.287
The last word always belongs
to the mountain.

26:49.200 --> 26:51.260
- Ang Dorjee!
- Yeah?

26:51.360 --> 26:53.567
Stay there, Beck, stay there.

26:54.200 --> 26:56.043
Okay, I'm coming down!

27:00.080 --> 27:01.980
Harold, Mike, this is Rob.

27:02.080 --> 27:04.765
- Mike here.
- This isn't happening, guys.

27:05.880 --> 27:07.769
Let's turn 'em around,

27:08.320 --> 27:11.483
let's get 'em off the face and back down
to Base Camp. Turn around.

27:11.600 --> 27:13.250
- Ang Dorjee, come on, we're going down.
- Okay.

27:19.720 --> 27:20.926
My hand.

27:22.880 --> 27:24.780
Okay, make a fist again.

27:24.880 --> 27:27.360
Keep clenching,
just keep the blood flowing.

27:30.320 --> 27:32.100
What's going on, man?

27:32.200 --> 27:34.660
We're still waiting
for the South Africans.

27:34.760 --> 27:37.081
Taiwanese took forever as well.

27:38.840 --> 27:41.660
Hey, Ian.
You haven't paid for these ladders.

27:41.760 --> 27:44.604
Yeah, yeah. Your Yak
Fund money's coming.

27:45.320 --> 27:46.580
You serious, man?

27:46.680 --> 27:47.920
Come on, get a move on.

27:54.760 --> 27:55.780
How long you been waiting here?

27:55.880 --> 27:57.060
Good 45 minutes.

27:57.160 --> 27:58.321
Man, it's freezing.

27:58.440 --> 28:00.380
- Yeah.
- It's stinging, huh?

28:00.480 --> 28:02.130
Yeah. Right at the tips.

28:02.240 --> 28:03.340
Hey, Rob, we gotta get 'em over.

28:03.440 --> 28:04.500
We're working on it.

28:04.600 --> 28:06.329
He's freezing, mate.

28:07.720 --> 28:09.700
- Are you set?
- Clear.

28:09.800 --> 28:12.644
- Sending him over, Mike!
- Yeah, all right.

28:19.120 --> 28:21.020
Looking good, Beck.

28:21.120 --> 28:22.645
Looking good.

28:29.800 --> 28:32.280
That's it. No, head up, mate, head up.

28:49.640 --> 28:50.766
Steady yourself!

28:51.640 --> 28:52.660
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

28:52.760 --> 28:55.540
Little help? Help! Help!

28:55.640 --> 28:57.900
Mike, you good?

28:58.000 --> 28:59.060
Are these ladders gonna take two?

28:59.160 --> 29:00.620
Yeah, I'll get a rope, I'll belay you.

29:00.720 --> 29:01.860
Just stay right where you are, mate.

29:01.960 --> 29:03.020
I can't pull myself up!

29:03.120 --> 29:05.500
I'm gonna come out to you.

29:05.600 --> 29:06.620
Okay.

29:06.720 --> 29:07.700
You're good, Beck, you're okay.

29:07.800 --> 29:08.820
Got it for you.

29:08.920 --> 29:11.140
- Right, tie me in, Scott, tie me in.
- Come and get me!

29:11.240 --> 29:12.620
- On belay?
- Got it. On belay.

29:12.720 --> 29:13.980
Let's go.

29:14.080 --> 29:16.481
Right, I'm coming out to you, Beck.
Here I come, mate.

29:22.320 --> 29:24.891
Nice and easy, you're tied in, mate.

29:25.920 --> 29:28.420
- I can't feel my hands.
- You're looking good.

29:28.520 --> 29:30.010
- Grab me.
- Beck, Beck, Beck.

29:30.120 --> 29:32.060
- Grab me!
- Stay right where you are, mate.

29:32.160 --> 29:33.380
I'm right here, I'm coming to you.

29:33.480 --> 29:35.380
I can't pull myself up!

29:35.480 --> 29:36.720
I got ya.

29:45.520 --> 29:46.851
You okay?

29:48.080 --> 29:50.860
There's no guarantee
to the summit, I get it.

29:50.960 --> 29:55.361
But to get killed because I'm waiting
in line like I'm in freaking Walmart.

29:55.480 --> 29:58.780
That's not why I
paid you 65,000 dollars.

29:58.880 --> 30:00.484
Now get me off of here.

30:02.040 --> 30:05.044
That's it.
Plant your feet one at a time.

30:11.600 --> 30:12.965
All right, thanks for coming by.

30:13.080 --> 30:14.020
Uh...

30:14.120 --> 30:17.500
Look, Base Camp's, you know,
chockablock full this year, so,

30:17.600 --> 30:19.620
I think it would all benefit us greatly

30:19.720 --> 30:20.900
by coming together like this

30:21.000 --> 30:23.260
and, you know, working out
some kind of plan and schedule.

30:23.360 --> 30:24.691
What, like some kind of rota?

30:24.800 --> 30:25.820
Yes.

30:25.920 --> 30:27.251
On Everest?

30:29.040 --> 30:32.340
Everyone knows Everest is a business
for you, Robert, are you kidding?

30:32.440 --> 30:34.620
What gives you the right to tell us
when we can climb and when we can't?

30:34.720 --> 30:36.609
I'm not telling you, mate. I'm asking.

30:37.200 --> 30:39.540
If we know when everybody's
planning to summit, for instance,

30:39.640 --> 30:42.808
you know, we can avoid the chaos
that happened in the Icefall today.

30:43.440 --> 30:45.700
Adventure Consultants
are aiming for May 10.

30:45.800 --> 30:47.780
- So are we, man!
- Us too.

30:47.880 --> 30:49.086
May 10.

30:51.440 --> 30:54.300
Okay, that's bumper-to-bumper
traffic on the Hillary Step.

30:54.400 --> 30:55.460
Yes, it is, that's my point.

30:55.560 --> 30:58.450
Look, this is ridiculous.
We're summiting when we want.

30:59.120 --> 31:00.060
All right?

31:00.160 --> 31:03.100
And I don't need your permission
to climb the mountain.

31:03.200 --> 31:05.260
Ian, have you seen how many people
are here at Base Camp?

31:05.360 --> 31:07.681
- We're finished here. Come on, guys.
- Ian! Hey, man.

31:22.160 --> 31:23.810
Oh, Rob!

31:24.280 --> 31:26.965
- Ah! Come in, man!
- Hi.

31:27.760 --> 31:29.980
Have a drink, Rob! Come on, man.

31:30.080 --> 31:31.740
Na zdorovie.

31:31.840 --> 31:33.171
Na zdorovie!

31:34.200 --> 31:36.248
- Can we have a word?
- Yeah.

31:41.840 --> 31:43.340
You feeling a little crook, huh?

31:43.440 --> 31:44.820
No, it's just a little...

31:44.920 --> 31:46.620
Little touch of the Delhi belly.

31:46.720 --> 31:48.100
He means Buddha belly.

31:48.200 --> 31:49.820
Maybe Sandy's caviar.

31:49.920 --> 31:52.700
I told you not to have
the Dom Perignon with it!

31:52.800 --> 31:54.802
What's going on, Roberto?

32:02.800 --> 32:06.140
I don't like the look
of the crowds on the ropes.

32:06.240 --> 32:09.688
I think we're gonna have some trouble
once we get above Camp Three.

32:10.400 --> 32:12.020
I mean, you wanna top
it on the 10th, yeah?

32:12.120 --> 32:13.690
- Yeah.
- So do I.

32:15.480 --> 32:17.460
What, are you saying we should team up?

32:17.560 --> 32:19.562
Well, it's an idea, yeah.

32:21.040 --> 32:22.485
Oh, man.

32:25.440 --> 32:28.330
I don't know, man.
We have different styles, man.

32:30.360 --> 32:34.331
All due respect, you're a hand-holder.
I mean, the best, but...

32:34.920 --> 32:37.220
I just believe that if you
can't get up there yourself

32:37.320 --> 32:39.780
you shouldn't be on the mountain at all.

32:39.880 --> 32:42.740
You guide your team, I guide mine.

32:42.840 --> 32:45.580
I'm just suggesting that we work
with each other instead of against.

32:45.680 --> 32:48.411
The only way we both summit,
mate, is if we work together.

32:49.480 --> 32:51.642
Particularly fixing the ropes.

32:52.360 --> 32:54.249
It's gotta make sense.

32:59.720 --> 33:02.087
Whoo-ie! Why not?

33:03.360 --> 33:06.060
- Yeah?
- Yeah, I see the sense in it.

33:06.160 --> 33:07.980
Good man. That was all.

33:08.080 --> 33:09.445
All right.

33:10.120 --> 33:12.930
Who's gonna lead when we get up there?

33:17.320 --> 33:20.244
Rob. If I say I will
do it, it will be done.

33:25.440 --> 33:26.420
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

33:26.520 --> 33:29.489
You gotta work with Ang Dorjee,
because we're working together now.

33:30.600 --> 33:32.740
I'm just saying, if both of us...

33:32.840 --> 33:34.808
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

33:35.600 --> 33:36.726
Okay?

33:37.240 --> 33:38.605
Ang Dorjee.

33:40.520 --> 33:41.965
We're all professionals here.

33:42.080 --> 33:44.300
We'll work together and
we'll get the job done. Yes?

33:44.400 --> 33:45.420
- All right.
- Yeah.

33:45.520 --> 33:49.600
We're planning on stashing, what, eight
bottles of O up at the South Summit.

33:49.720 --> 33:51.780
- Well, I'm not using O.
- What do you mean?

33:51.880 --> 33:53.100
You're not using oxygen at all?

33:53.200 --> 33:54.300
Come on, man. You know you want to.

33:54.400 --> 33:55.820
English air. Don't need it.

33:55.920 --> 33:58.100
Yeah, but Anatoli,
you're guiding for Scott this year.

33:58.200 --> 34:00.740
You have people's lives
in your hands. It's a job.

34:00.840 --> 34:03.411
Never used it. Never will.

34:03.520 --> 34:05.807
Bigger problems if you run out.

34:06.920 --> 34:07.921
Okay.

34:08.560 --> 34:09.971
I'll put some more
bottles of O up there.

34:10.080 --> 34:11.605
- All right, that'll be good.
- All right.

34:12.440 --> 34:13.580
Just so long as you guys are clear.

34:13.679 --> 34:16.500
If you work for me, you use oxygen,
otherwise you don't work for me.

34:16.600 --> 34:18.045
You don't have to ask, mate.

34:18.159 --> 34:19.620
I've been up there
before without O's, Rob.

34:19.719 --> 34:21.219
I don't need to do it with clients.

34:21.320 --> 34:23.482
All right, next we have to fix ropes.

34:23.600 --> 34:26.060
- Yeah.
- Particularly above the Lhotse Face.

34:26.159 --> 34:28.020
Hillary Step need new fixed rope.

34:28.120 --> 34:29.500
And South-East Ridge as well.

34:29.600 --> 34:30.761
Yes, it does. Well...

34:30.880 --> 34:33.300
My idea is that we work together
and we fix ropes together.

34:33.400 --> 34:34.500
We share the duties.

34:34.600 --> 34:35.739
- Okay?
- Sounds good.

34:35.840 --> 34:37.460
All right, you and Lopsang
maybe get together.

34:37.560 --> 34:40.370
Talk about who wants
to fix what and where, okay?

34:41.040 --> 34:45.444
Only essentials. I'm not gonna tell you
what to pack, but be brutal. Okay?

34:45.560 --> 34:47.847
One pound down here is like 10 up there.

34:49.080 --> 34:51.940
Light and fast.

34:52.040 --> 34:55.362
What, and just like that,
you kill my summit cappuccino.

34:56.400 --> 34:58.767
Go, go, go! Run!

34:58.880 --> 35:01.500
- That camera's totally dying.
- Okay.

35:01.600 --> 35:03.620
All right, it's gonna be a tough week.

35:03.720 --> 35:07.020
But it is gonna be the best Friday
of your lives.

35:07.120 --> 35:09.340
Yeah, what are we doing again on Friday?

35:09.440 --> 35:11.329
Summiting!

35:14.360 --> 35:16.140
- Now it's up to me, right?
- Yes, it is, yes, it is.

35:16.240 --> 35:17.260
I'll take three.

35:17.360 --> 35:18.600
It's from Jan.

35:21.360 --> 35:24.780
I knew it was gonna be a girl.
I can't believe it.

35:24.880 --> 35:25.881
It's a girl!

35:29.280 --> 35:30.980
All right, good on you!

35:31.080 --> 35:32.420
I knew I was.

35:32.520 --> 35:33.500
- I knew she was.
- Congratulations.

35:33.600 --> 35:35.409
Thank you, thank you, Doug.
Cheers, mate.

35:36.200 --> 35:37.740
When's she due?

35:37.840 --> 35:39.340
Mid-July, as soon as I get back.

35:39.440 --> 35:40.860
You better sleep now, buddy.

35:40.960 --> 35:42.405
Yeah, that's true.

35:42.880 --> 35:44.340
Hey, Rob.

35:44.440 --> 35:45.740
- Yeah?
- So...

35:45.840 --> 35:47.285
Jan doesn't mind you being here?

35:47.520 --> 35:48.521
Uh-oh.

35:48.760 --> 35:51.180
Krakauer's sword is unleashed.

35:51.280 --> 35:53.860
It's okay.
Jan's a climber, Jon, she gets it.

35:53.960 --> 35:55.820
- Yeah!
- Cheers, Helen.

35:55.920 --> 35:57.460
What about you, Doug?
What about your wife?

35:57.560 --> 35:59.688
Oh, she's been fine with it,
ever since we divorced.

36:00.920 --> 36:02.140
She's been great
with everything since then.

36:02.240 --> 36:03.340
I'm so sorry, buddy.

36:03.440 --> 36:04.780
No, no.

36:04.880 --> 36:07.580
No, no, no, I ask
because Peach said to me,

36:07.680 --> 36:10.020
"If you climb one more mountain,
I will divorce you."

36:10.120 --> 36:13.203
And you went ahead
and then booked this trip!

36:14.040 --> 36:19.089
No, no, no, the worst part of it
is that I kind of forgot to tell her.

36:20.760 --> 36:22.500
You don't forget to tell her
you're climbing Everest!

36:22.600 --> 36:23.540
I forgot to tell her, I did.

36:23.640 --> 36:26.660
All right. It's all on the table, here.

36:26.760 --> 36:30.980
It hurts, it's dangerous,
it destroys relationships,

36:31.080 --> 36:32.700
it's costing you all a small fortune.

36:32.800 --> 36:34.340
Are there any negative
aspects to this game?

36:34.440 --> 36:37.540
I gotta ask the question, you know I do.

36:37.640 --> 36:39.085
Why?

36:40.440 --> 36:41.601
Why.

36:43.240 --> 36:44.180
Because...

36:44.280 --> 36:45.964
It's there!

36:46.600 --> 36:48.568
That's why. Thank you, Mr. Mallory.

36:48.680 --> 36:51.180
Come on. Guys, I'm serious.

36:51.280 --> 36:54.170
Yasuko. Why are you climbing Everest?

36:55.400 --> 36:56.380
Uh...

36:56.480 --> 36:58.380
I'm 47 years old,

36:58.480 --> 37:02.060
I have reached six of
the seven summits, so...

37:02.160 --> 37:05.780
Of course, now I have
to reach the seventh.

37:05.880 --> 37:07.450
That's not an answer.

37:08.000 --> 37:10.180
No. Why any summit?

37:10.280 --> 37:11.420
Doug.

37:11.520 --> 37:12.806
- Me?
- Why?

37:13.960 --> 37:14.900
Come on, tell 'em about the kids.

37:15.000 --> 37:15.980
What?

37:16.080 --> 37:17.380
Tell 'em about the kids.

37:17.480 --> 37:18.860
- Whose kids?
- Oh...

37:18.960 --> 37:20.689
You have kids?

37:20.800 --> 37:23.260
Yeah, I have kids,
but, I thought I told you,

37:23.360 --> 37:25.840
there's an elementary school, back home.

37:26.520 --> 37:28.522
And I've been going
and talking to the kids there

37:28.640 --> 37:32.060
and they actually helped me
raise some of the money to come

37:32.160 --> 37:35.420
and gave me a flag
to plant on the summit, and...

37:35.520 --> 37:38.580
So, I was thinking, maybe it's...

37:38.680 --> 37:42.300
They see a regular guy can,

37:42.400 --> 37:44.580
you know, follow impossible dreams,

37:44.680 --> 37:48.602
maybe they'll be inspired
to do the same, I guess.

37:49.360 --> 37:51.840
I'm climbing Mount Everest

37:53.680 --> 37:55.205
because I can.

37:56.000 --> 37:58.100
Because to be able to climb that high

37:58.200 --> 38:01.363
and see that kind of beauty
that nobody ever sees,

38:02.480 --> 38:04.642
it'd be a crime not to.

38:06.200 --> 38:07.220
Hear, hear, Dougie.

38:07.320 --> 38:09.209
- There you go.
- I like that.

38:14.720 --> 38:15.780
Hello?

38:15.880 --> 38:17.723
Hey. Did I wake you?

38:18.840 --> 38:20.001
No.

38:20.560 --> 38:22.483
I did too, you liar.

38:23.040 --> 38:24.087
Huh?

38:25.880 --> 38:27.723
- You okay?
- Yeah.

38:28.280 --> 38:29.900
Yeah, yeah, I'm good, I'm better.

38:30.000 --> 38:31.365
I'm better now, I'm...

38:31.920 --> 38:33.251
I miss you.

38:34.520 --> 38:37.046
We go for the final ascent tomorrow.

38:37.560 --> 38:39.980
So, you summit Friday?

38:40.080 --> 38:41.650
Yeah, the 10th.

38:42.480 --> 38:43.620
It's your lucky day.

38:43.720 --> 38:44.926
It is.

38:45.760 --> 38:47.410
How's the weather?

38:47.920 --> 38:49.420
It's good.

38:49.520 --> 38:51.522
Yeah, I think we're
gonna get a good window.

38:52.120 --> 38:54.340
So, it's a girl.

38:54.440 --> 38:55.660
Yeah.

38:55.760 --> 38:58.540
And did you go to the doctor,
did you get a scan done?

38:58.640 --> 38:59.660
Did you see her?

38:59.760 --> 39:01.046
Yeah, sure did.

39:02.960 --> 39:05.980
And? Come on. What did she look like?

39:06.080 --> 39:09.980
Oh, you know. Blonde hair, nice smile,
perfect height-to-weight ratio,

39:10.080 --> 39:12.924
she's gonna be a great climber.

39:14.120 --> 39:15.770
She's there, Rob.

39:16.280 --> 39:18.647
- Already.
- Wow.

39:19.080 --> 39:20.660
A little me, a little you.

39:20.760 --> 39:22.285
A little bear, huh?

39:24.120 --> 39:26.691
And then, one day, you

39:26.800 --> 39:28.131
and me

39:29.120 --> 39:32.180
and our little Sarah,
we'll all go climbing together. Hmm?

39:32.280 --> 39:33.520
Sarah?

39:34.600 --> 39:36.580
Yeah, what do you think?

39:36.680 --> 39:38.700
- No way!
- Come on.

39:38.800 --> 39:39.780
No!

39:39.880 --> 39:41.180
Please? Think about it.

39:41.280 --> 39:42.611
- No.
- Huh?

39:47.280 --> 39:48.540
You still there?

39:48.640 --> 39:50.688
Of course I'm still here.

39:53.360 --> 39:54.646
I love you.

39:55.480 --> 39:57.050
Love you, too.

40:01.640 --> 40:03.220
Sleep well, my love.

40:03.320 --> 40:05.288
All right. Bye.

41:20.760 --> 41:23.660
Take it easy, now. You're gonna be okay.

41:23.760 --> 41:25.980
We're gonna get you
down the hill. All right?

41:26.080 --> 41:27.500
Hey, Neal, you okay?

41:27.600 --> 41:29.409
Yeah, Dale, he doesn't look too good.

41:30.360 --> 41:31.300
We need to take him down.

41:31.400 --> 41:32.820
Yeah.

41:32.920 --> 41:34.820
You can't get Scott on the radio?

41:34.920 --> 41:37.366
Nope. Nah, I think he's up ahead.

41:47.680 --> 41:49.500
Best not to stare too long
at the summit.

41:49.600 --> 41:51.841
That's a long way to go, man.

41:54.280 --> 41:57.500
Head down, one step at a time.

41:57.600 --> 41:59.284
You got it, boss.

42:02.080 --> 42:03.660
You seen Dale?

42:03.760 --> 42:06.540
Yeah, I did, he wasn't looking too good

42:06.640 --> 42:09.860
but Neal seemed to have
a handle on the situation.

42:09.960 --> 42:10.940
Tried to get you on the radio.

42:11.040 --> 42:12.963
- You're kidding me.
- No.

42:14.000 --> 42:16.162
This thing's not working, huh?

42:17.120 --> 42:18.531
I'm going down to Camp One.

42:18.640 --> 42:20.529
If he's not doing so well, I'm gonna
take him down to Base Camp

42:20.640 --> 42:23.340
and I'll head back up.
You guys all right?

42:23.440 --> 42:24.680
Yeah.

42:26.120 --> 42:28.060
He can't be too far ahead of you, mate.

42:28.160 --> 42:30.970
Yeah, I'll make it
down in half the time.

42:32.000 --> 42:33.809
I'm gonna catch you! Whoo!

42:51.600 --> 42:52.540
Rob to Guy.

42:52.640 --> 42:55.060
Rob to Guy, you up there, mate?

42:55.160 --> 42:57.640
Yeah, Guy to Rob. I'm here.

42:57.760 --> 42:58.807
Good to hear you, Gee.

42:59.520 --> 43:01.180
Where are you?

43:01.280 --> 43:03.140
Camp One, Pumori.

43:03.240 --> 43:04.446
Yeah.

43:05.440 --> 43:07.980
There you go, I got the old sly rotter.

43:08.080 --> 43:10.606
Listen, I think you're on
the wrong mountain, there.

43:11.520 --> 43:13.580
Look, I can't talk,
we gotta get out of here.

43:13.680 --> 43:14.620
All right, mate.

43:14.720 --> 43:16.900
Well, listen, you take care
on the kiddie slope.

43:17.000 --> 43:18.580
I'm gonna get back to the real thing.

43:18.680 --> 43:21.843
Yeah, don't worry, Rob.
I'll keep an eye on you.

43:30.840 --> 43:31.841
Ice!

43:36.720 --> 43:37.767
Rob!

43:39.040 --> 43:40.451
I got you!

43:50.880 --> 43:52.211
Harold, you okay?

43:56.040 --> 43:57.620
Is everyone okay?

43:57.720 --> 43:59.324
We're okay!

44:04.560 --> 44:06.460
Come here, sit down, sit.

44:06.560 --> 44:07.766
I'm fine.

44:09.400 --> 44:10.660
Look at me.

44:10.760 --> 44:11.980
- Look at me.
- I'm fine, mate.

44:12.080 --> 44:13.100
Look at me, Harold!

44:13.200 --> 44:14.700
Look, I'm telling you, I'm all right.

44:14.800 --> 44:16.609
- Okay.
- I'm all right.

44:19.040 --> 44:20.201
- There you go.
- Thank you.

44:20.880 --> 44:23.247
Don't do that to me again, eh?

44:24.440 --> 44:25.805
I'm sorry.

44:26.920 --> 44:27.980
Okay, mate.

44:28.080 --> 44:31.180
I'm gonna drop back with Frank,
he's struggling a bit, all right?

44:31.280 --> 44:32.691
All right.

44:36.720 --> 44:37.721
Straight down.

44:38.720 --> 44:40.420
Let's get him on the oxygen.

44:40.520 --> 44:42.020
Rob Hall to Scott Fischer,
Rob Hall to Scott Fischer,

44:42.120 --> 44:43.360
Mountain Madness, how do you copy?

44:44.160 --> 44:46.561
Hey, man! Scott, here.

44:47.160 --> 44:49.700
I've been down to Base Camp,
and I'm back at Camp One.

44:49.800 --> 44:51.340
I'm gonna catch you tomorrow.

44:51.440 --> 44:53.920
What, you're not gonna
rest up a day first? No?

44:55.120 --> 44:56.690
Scott, you sound a little rough.

44:57.480 --> 44:59.020
Mate, take an extra day.

44:59.120 --> 45:02.044
No way, José, what,
miss out on all the fun?

45:02.760 --> 45:06.060
That's a lot of up and down in one day,
even for you, Scott.

45:06.160 --> 45:08.288
You know what they say, man.

45:09.120 --> 45:11.964
It's not the altitude,
it's the attitude.

45:13.480 --> 45:15.580
Are you sure you're gonna be okay?

45:15.680 --> 45:16.780
- Scott?
- I'll be good.

45:16.880 --> 45:19.645
Just taking a shot of dexamethasone now.

45:20.600 --> 45:24.321
Well, just don't push yourself
too hard, okay? Over and out.

45:31.160 --> 45:34.700
Rob, I've just been over to Mal's
to get a weather update.

45:34.800 --> 45:36.540
It's moving fast.

45:36.640 --> 45:39.166
It's changed course slightly.

45:40.160 --> 45:43.140
And it could still go north,
but, if it doesn't

45:43.240 --> 45:46.926
it's gonna hit sometime
on the 11th, I reckon.

45:49.600 --> 45:51.820
It's a weather forecast, Helen.

45:51.920 --> 45:53.820
This mountain makes its own weather.

45:53.920 --> 45:55.001
We're keeping an eye on it.

45:56.240 --> 45:58.322
Yeah, sure, just letting you know.

45:58.440 --> 46:00.010
Appreciate it, Helen.

46:02.760 --> 46:04.683
Why do we do this to ourselves?

46:09.200 --> 46:10.690
Oh, this is crazy.

46:16.360 --> 46:20.681
You know, I never told Krakauer this when
he was asking us why we climb Everest.

46:21.440 --> 46:23.044
When I'm at home

46:24.680 --> 46:26.444
I just got this big,

46:27.880 --> 46:30.260
black cloud following me.

46:30.360 --> 46:32.488
You know, like a depression?

46:33.760 --> 46:36.740
And when I'm out here
on a mountain, any mountain...

46:36.840 --> 46:38.080
Yeah?

46:39.680 --> 46:41.762
It's just like it's a cure.

46:43.520 --> 46:45.409
I feel like I'm reborn.

46:45.880 --> 46:47.962
So, you're happy now?

46:49.560 --> 46:51.642
No, I'm starting to wonder.

46:54.400 --> 46:56.243
This is suffering, man.

46:57.880 --> 46:59.803
- Yeah.
- This is suffering.

46:59.920 --> 47:01.251
Yeah.

47:02.080 --> 47:06.060
Suffer a few more days,
for the rest of your life you'll be a guy

47:06.160 --> 47:08.401
that got to the top of Everest.

47:08.640 --> 47:10.483
- Mmm.
- Huh?

47:13.760 --> 47:15.922
I just hope I get there.

47:16.600 --> 47:17.965
Yeah.

47:19.440 --> 47:21.966
Just hope I get there, and get home.

47:28.280 --> 47:30.009
What do you think, Mike?

47:32.880 --> 47:34.340
Looks pretty good.

47:34.440 --> 47:37.020
Little bit of wind, up higher.

47:37.120 --> 47:39.260
I mean, if it picks up,
we can always come back down.

47:39.360 --> 47:41.601
- Exactly.
- It's your call, Rob.

47:42.720 --> 47:45.291
Let's get 'em all going.

48:39.760 --> 48:40.740
Rob!

48:40.840 --> 48:42.001
You okay?

48:42.720 --> 48:44.006
Not good!

48:47.640 --> 48:48.641
Ah.

48:49.640 --> 48:52.660
I'm hoping it's gonna
die down after sundown.

48:52.760 --> 48:54.700
It's been doing that.

48:54.800 --> 48:56.340
I don't like this.

48:56.440 --> 48:59.500
Well, we don't go if it doesn't calm.

48:59.600 --> 49:01.780
I talk to Scott when he comes here.

49:01.880 --> 49:02.881
Okay.

49:16.200 --> 49:18.340
Scott! Scott!

49:18.440 --> 49:20.010
- Toli?
- Here!

49:30.840 --> 49:31.780
Toli!

49:31.880 --> 49:34.500
Where's Rob? Where are they?

49:34.600 --> 49:35.931
- We go down!
- No.

49:36.600 --> 49:39.683
What's Rob's... What's Rob's team doing?

49:40.400 --> 49:43.722
He wants to see if this passes.

49:44.600 --> 49:46.090
If he waits,

49:49.120 --> 49:50.260
we wait.

49:50.360 --> 49:51.441
Okay.

50:05.400 --> 50:06.890
Hey, guys.

50:07.480 --> 50:09.482
Come out and take a look.

50:23.600 --> 50:26.060
At least somebody up there loves us.

50:26.160 --> 50:27.446
Nothing?

50:31.160 --> 50:33.242
Where'd the storm go?

50:33.640 --> 50:35.130
Exactly.

50:36.000 --> 50:37.604
That's crazy.

50:37.720 --> 50:39.643
You ready to saddle up?

50:41.960 --> 50:45.089
Okay, everyone. We got a window.

50:46.320 --> 50:50.740
We don't know how long it's gonna last,
but we're gonna go for it.

50:50.840 --> 50:52.700
Be ready in half an hour.

50:52.800 --> 50:55.340
We'll have a 2:00 p.m. turnaround,
let's climb this thing.

50:55.440 --> 50:56.566
Okay.

51:00.880 --> 51:02.962
So, today's the day, huh?

51:03.680 --> 51:04.920
Yep.

51:06.640 --> 51:08.165
Now or never.

51:11.360 --> 51:12.930
Oh, boy.

51:16.320 --> 51:18.780
Now the South Africans
were late out of Camp Three.

51:18.880 --> 51:20.980
They never made it into Camp Four.

51:21.080 --> 51:22.780
Probably got caught up in it.

51:22.880 --> 51:24.580
Maybe it blew through early.

51:24.680 --> 51:27.100
Yeah, well, it hit us all night,

51:27.200 --> 51:29.980
but now there's nothing.
Absolutely nothing.

51:30.080 --> 51:32.287
So, it's definitely worth a shot.

51:32.400 --> 51:35.210
I'll radio out and
tell everyone the news.

51:36.080 --> 51:37.570
Any messages?

51:38.240 --> 51:41.340
Yeah, ring Jan and tell her
that we're heading out.

51:41.440 --> 51:44.780
I'll call you, Helen, in 12 hours
when we get to the summit.

51:44.880 --> 51:46.660
Turnaround's 2:00 p.m.

51:46.760 --> 51:48.660
Good luck, and Godspeed to you all.

51:48.760 --> 51:51.740
- Okay, thanks, Helen. Bye-bye.
- I'll see you guys up there.

51:51.840 --> 51:52.900
- Take it easy, Scott.
- Let's do it.

51:53.000 --> 51:55.260
Gonna get a couple hours
of sleep, and I'll be right behind you.

51:55.360 --> 51:56.340
- Yeah, okay.
- See you at the top.

51:56.440 --> 51:57.460
Have fun, Pittman.

51:57.560 --> 51:59.380
You get some rest, okay?

51:59.480 --> 52:00.420
See you there.

52:00.520 --> 52:02.260
You got the ropes for the Hillary Step?

52:02.360 --> 52:03.460
Yeah.

52:03.560 --> 52:04.860
- Okay.
- Okay.

52:04.960 --> 52:06.803
Okay. Yeah.

52:23.080 --> 52:24.900
Can we go any faster?

52:25.000 --> 52:28.180
Not a chance we can go
faster here. It's too difficult.

52:28.280 --> 52:30.282
This could take a while.

52:31.200 --> 52:32.964
We're losing time.

52:59.320 --> 53:01.380
Beck. What's wrong?

53:01.480 --> 53:02.970
I don't know.

53:05.720 --> 53:09.100
I had an operation a couple
years ago, on my eyes.

53:09.200 --> 53:10.486
That might be it.

53:11.160 --> 53:13.401
- I don't know.
- Okay.

53:14.480 --> 53:16.300
You guys go in front of us.

53:16.400 --> 53:19.449
All right, Beck, let's sit you down.

53:25.120 --> 53:27.282
Beck. Look at me.

53:29.760 --> 53:30.820
I need to send you down with someone.

53:30.920 --> 53:32.081
No, I don't wanna go down, Rob.

53:32.200 --> 53:35.488
- No, you gotta go down.
- I don't wanna go down.

53:38.640 --> 53:39.846
Okay.

53:42.720 --> 53:45.660
Right, Beck, listen.

53:45.760 --> 53:48.047
You can wait here for half an hour.
Beck, listen to me.

53:48.160 --> 53:52.560
If it gets better by then
join in the queue and keep going up.

53:53.200 --> 53:55.540
But if it doesn't get better,
Beck, I'm sorry, mate, it's over.

53:55.640 --> 53:56.620
Okay.

53:56.720 --> 53:59.490
The Sherpas are gonna go up and drop off
the extra oxygen at the South Summit

54:00.280 --> 54:02.089
then I'm gonna send one
of them down for you.

54:02.200 --> 54:04.009
- Is that clear? Yeah?
- Mmm-hmm.

54:05.800 --> 54:07.220
Okay, mate.

54:07.320 --> 54:08.685
All right.

54:12.480 --> 54:13.925
See you.

54:15.040 --> 54:17.260
Sandy, do you want to go down?

54:17.360 --> 54:19.580
What? No. No way.

54:19.680 --> 54:21.740
Look, Lopsang,
I'm gonna make it to the top.

54:21.840 --> 54:22.841
Do you understand?

54:23.800 --> 54:25.340
- Okay.
- I'm not going back.

54:25.440 --> 54:27.329
- Okay?
- Okay.

54:39.360 --> 54:40.660
Where are the ropes?

54:40.760 --> 54:43.220
There is no rope! No rope.

54:43.320 --> 54:44.651
Yeah, they should have been fixed.

54:44.760 --> 54:46.649
Do you have more in your pack?

54:46.760 --> 54:49.380
Lopsang has the rope. He's not here!

54:49.480 --> 54:51.528
Harold. No ropes?

54:51.640 --> 54:52.687
No.

54:53.880 --> 54:54.900
Neal.

54:55.000 --> 54:56.047
Hey, Rob.

54:57.080 --> 54:58.620
Listen, we got a problem, here, mate.

54:58.720 --> 55:02.340
There's no fixed ropes on the traverse
to the Hillary Step, over.

55:02.440 --> 55:03.660
Where's Ang Dorjee and Lopsang?

55:03.760 --> 55:06.780
Yeah, I've got Ang Dorjee here,
but there's no sign of Lopsang.

55:06.880 --> 55:11.340
So me, Neal, and Toli are gonna
have to set some new ones, over.

55:11.440 --> 55:12.580
- Find them?
- Yeah.

55:12.680 --> 55:14.569
- Good.
- Let's do it!

55:19.400 --> 55:20.980
What's going on?

55:21.080 --> 55:22.730
No fixed ropes.

55:22.840 --> 55:23.887
What?

55:53.280 --> 55:54.780
That's it.

55:54.880 --> 55:57.121
One step at a time, Doug.

56:05.080 --> 56:07.686
Come on, Dougie. Deep breaths, Dougie.

56:07.800 --> 56:09.460
Come on, mate, keep it on, keep it on.

56:09.560 --> 56:12.220
Deep breaths, Dougie, hang on. Hang on.

56:21.000 --> 56:22.900
You can do this, Dougie.

56:23.000 --> 56:24.100
I know you can, pal.

56:24.200 --> 56:25.201
Yeah.

56:26.920 --> 56:28.809
I don't wanna see you
back here a third time, mate.

56:29.800 --> 56:30.801
Huh?

56:46.560 --> 56:49.530
John. You headed back down?

56:50.800 --> 56:52.220
There's a holdup.

56:52.320 --> 56:54.460
There's no fixed ropes
above the South Summit.

56:54.560 --> 56:57.820
Yeah, I know, mate, but we're
sorting that situation out now.

56:57.920 --> 57:01.060
Ran out of juice, waiting. Cold.

57:01.160 --> 57:02.660
I'm sorry, Rob.

57:02.760 --> 57:04.524
It's your call, pal.

57:07.640 --> 57:10.660
I don't wanna run
out of oxygen up there.

57:10.760 --> 57:12.171
Sorry, Rob.

57:19.000 --> 57:20.540
Yeah, bit of a setback.

57:20.640 --> 57:23.700
Lou, Stuart, and John Taske
just turned back.

57:23.800 --> 57:25.900
Just below the South Summit.

57:26.000 --> 57:27.580
How are the conditions, so far?

57:27.680 --> 57:29.060
Cold and windy.

57:29.160 --> 57:30.500
Okay, let me know, Rob.

57:30.600 --> 57:32.841
Okay, Helen, thanks, bye-bye.

57:34.400 --> 57:38.820
I hope we're not looking at another year
with no clients at the top.

57:38.920 --> 57:40.980
Well, if they don't get
a move on pretty soon

57:41.080 --> 57:43.060
they're out of time, aren't they?

57:43.160 --> 57:44.241
Yeah.

57:45.480 --> 57:49.121
And what's Jon gonna say
about that in his article?

57:49.600 --> 57:51.820
It's Rob. Guys...

57:51.920 --> 57:54.127
We just lost Lou, Stu, and John Taske.

57:54.240 --> 57:56.380
What's going on, what's the holdup?

57:56.480 --> 57:57.900
Yeah, mate, we're...

57:58.000 --> 58:02.300
We still have Toli and Neal
at the top of the Step

58:02.400 --> 58:03.811
fixing the ropes.

58:04.600 --> 58:07.580
We're at the base of the Step, over.

58:07.680 --> 58:09.250
Rob, it's Mike.

58:10.280 --> 58:11.300
How's Doug faring?

58:11.400 --> 58:14.980
Doug's just behind me,
I left him behind to scoot forward.

58:15.080 --> 58:19.140
Yeah, I got eyes on you right now,
yep, that's me. Let's move as...

58:19.240 --> 58:20.980
As quickly as possible, over.

58:21.080 --> 58:25.085
We'll start moving everybody up,
as soon as we get the all clear.

58:25.680 --> 58:28.180
Rob to base, Rob to base,
how copy, Helen?

58:28.280 --> 58:30.660
- You all right?
- Copy, Base Camp to Rob.

58:30.760 --> 58:32.500
Have you heard from Scott?

58:32.600 --> 58:35.500
Anyone managed to find out
where he is, over?

58:35.600 --> 58:37.820
Whoo-ie! Yo, dude!

58:37.920 --> 58:39.740
Look, where are you, mate?

58:39.840 --> 58:41.380
We got a real logjam,
here at the Hillary Step, over.

58:41.480 --> 58:42.970
We're more than an hour behind!

58:43.080 --> 58:44.060
Just chill.

58:44.160 --> 58:46.620
People are just sitting here,
using up their oxygen.

58:46.720 --> 58:48.848
Get here as soon as you can.

58:50.600 --> 58:52.060
You feeling okay, Beck?

58:52.160 --> 58:55.220
Yeah, I got a little
problem with my eyes.

58:55.320 --> 58:56.446
You guys turned back?

58:56.960 --> 59:00.248
There's a logjam below
the Hillary Step. It's crazy.

59:01.000 --> 59:02.420
Come down with us.

59:02.520 --> 59:05.340
Nah, I can't, promised
Rob I'd wait for him.

59:05.440 --> 59:06.900
- Your call.
- I'm good.

59:07.000 --> 59:08.980
See you down there.

59:09.080 --> 59:10.764
Neal, ready!

59:11.800 --> 59:15.168
Okay, Toli! I'm done.

59:16.800 --> 59:20.300
Off rope! Safe to climb!

59:20.400 --> 59:21.860
Okay, we're climbing up!

59:21.960 --> 59:23.121
- Hey, Mike.
- What?

59:23.240 --> 59:24.969
- You mind if I go first?
- Why?

59:25.080 --> 59:26.206
I'm running pretty low on O.

59:28.440 --> 59:30.420
Rob, it's Mike, here.

59:30.520 --> 59:33.420
We've had the all-clear on this end.

59:33.520 --> 59:37.260
I'm gonna stay here with Yasuko,
until we get a clear line.

59:37.360 --> 59:40.842
I'll be here till I get a visual
on Doug, over and out.

01:00:33.560 --> 01:00:35.005
Come here.

01:00:38.520 --> 01:00:39.646
We did it!

01:01:03.520 --> 01:01:05.090
You did it!

01:01:34.120 --> 01:01:35.360
Yasuko.

01:01:38.280 --> 01:01:39.500
- Seven.
- Seven.

01:01:39.600 --> 01:01:40.965
- Seven Summits.
- Seven.

01:01:42.320 --> 01:01:46.020
Come here. I'm so proud of you, Yasuko.

01:01:46.120 --> 01:01:47.940
So proud.

01:01:48.040 --> 01:01:49.405
Thank you.

01:01:55.280 --> 01:01:57.282
Rob to Base, Rob to Base.

01:02:00.320 --> 01:02:02.740
Rob, this is Helen, hello?
Where are you?

01:02:02.840 --> 01:02:05.300
I'm on the top of Everest,
Helen, we made it.

01:02:06.800 --> 01:02:08.040
How copy us, over?

01:02:08.160 --> 01:02:10.060
We copy you loud and clear, Rob.

01:02:10.160 --> 01:02:13.020
It's wonderful to
hear your voice up there.

01:02:13.120 --> 01:02:14.420
Who are you with, again, say?

01:02:14.520 --> 01:02:16.409
At the moment, I'm with Mike and Yasuko.

01:02:16.520 --> 01:02:18.100
- Headed down, Rob.
- Now you have to go.

01:02:18.200 --> 01:02:20.140
Rob. See you. Thank you.

01:02:20.240 --> 01:02:22.720
Jon K has already been and gone.

01:02:22.840 --> 01:02:24.540
Doug is just coming over the horizon.

01:02:24.640 --> 01:02:26.660
And what about Beck?

01:02:26.760 --> 01:02:29.380
Beck was having a problem
with his eyesight.

01:02:29.480 --> 01:02:33.660
He waited on the southeast
ridge, on the Balcony

01:02:33.760 --> 01:02:36.060
for the first people
that came back, over.

01:02:36.160 --> 01:02:39.060
And I guess you'll be
leaving right away, yes?

01:02:39.160 --> 01:02:40.700
We'll be off in a few minutes.

01:02:40.800 --> 01:02:43.460
Just as soon as I see Doug,
we'll be heading back down, over.

01:02:43.560 --> 01:02:44.540
Right, understood.

01:02:44.640 --> 01:02:46.300
Well, that's terrific, Rob.

01:02:46.400 --> 01:02:48.900
We're all keeping
our fingers crossed for Doug.

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:50.809
Over and out, Helen.

01:03:03.040 --> 01:03:04.980
- Congratulations.
- Welcome!

01:03:05.080 --> 01:03:06.100
Yeah, Lopsy!

01:03:06.200 --> 01:03:07.361
You did it!

01:03:12.240 --> 01:03:13.241
Whoo-ie!

01:03:41.560 --> 01:03:43.324
You look terrible.

01:03:44.200 --> 01:03:47.443
My stomach's not so good, man.

01:03:48.120 --> 01:03:49.100
See Doug?

01:03:49.200 --> 01:03:51.043
Oh, yeah. He's way, way,

01:03:52.080 --> 01:03:54.020
way back there, man.

01:03:54.120 --> 01:03:57.780
Hey, Roberto.
Where are the rest of your guys?

01:03:57.880 --> 01:04:00.980
'Cause I'm pretty sure my whole team

01:04:01.080 --> 01:04:02.500
made it up, yeah?

01:04:02.600 --> 01:04:03.965
I saw 'em.

01:04:04.480 --> 01:04:06.660
Don't worry, I won't tell Krakauer.

01:04:06.760 --> 01:04:09.020
Well done, mate. I had a mixed bag.

01:04:09.120 --> 01:04:11.202
I'll have to give you this year.

01:04:11.320 --> 01:04:13.540
Scott, you really don't look too good.

01:04:13.640 --> 01:04:15.220
- Lopsang.
- Yeah?

01:04:15.320 --> 01:04:17.721
Come on, mate, let's get him down.

01:04:23.960 --> 01:04:26.611
All right. Let's go.

01:04:51.440 --> 01:04:53.886
Harold. What are you doing?

01:04:54.960 --> 01:04:59.340
I'm just trying to sort the O.
I can't find any full ones.

01:04:59.440 --> 01:05:01.460
There's full bottles,
I saw 'em on the way up.

01:05:01.560 --> 01:05:02.540
No.

01:05:02.640 --> 01:05:04.460
No, I'm pretty sure,
you should have another look.

01:05:04.560 --> 01:05:06.860
No, I just have, they're not full.

01:05:06.960 --> 01:05:07.940
Harold, listen, I saw...

01:05:08.040 --> 01:05:10.122
Look, mate, I checked twice, all right?

01:05:11.160 --> 01:05:13.845
Yeah. All right, man.

01:05:15.320 --> 01:05:16.845
I'm going down.

01:05:18.680 --> 01:05:20.125
Harold?

01:05:28.120 --> 01:05:29.770
Doug, Doug, Doug.

01:05:31.360 --> 01:05:32.900
- It's over, mate.
- What?

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:34.740
- I'm sorry.
- No, no, no.

01:05:34.840 --> 01:05:36.740
Doug, you're too late, okay?

01:05:38.040 --> 01:05:40.500
You guys keep going,
mate, I'll catch up.

01:05:40.600 --> 01:05:42.500
Doug, Doug. Doug, listen to me.

01:05:42.600 --> 01:05:44.420
- It's way too late. It's over.
- No, come on!

01:05:44.520 --> 01:05:46.940
Listen to me, mate, I'm sorry,

01:05:47.040 --> 01:05:49.460
but I gotta turn you around.

01:05:49.560 --> 01:05:50.607
Okay?

01:05:51.680 --> 01:05:53.205
I can do it.

01:05:54.600 --> 01:05:57.410
It's right here, man. It's right here.

01:05:58.520 --> 01:06:02.081
I'm not coming back next year,
man, it's my last chance.

01:06:05.440 --> 01:06:07.442
You gotta let me do this.

01:06:09.200 --> 01:06:10.770
Let me do this.

01:06:11.560 --> 01:06:13.100
- Okay.
- Please, Rob.

01:06:13.200 --> 01:06:14.380
Let's do it.

01:06:14.480 --> 01:06:16.180
- Let's get it done.
- All right.

01:06:16.280 --> 01:06:18.169
- Come on.
- Thanks, man.

01:06:22.560 --> 01:06:24.085
Come on, Doug.

01:06:44.440 --> 01:06:47.900
There ain't no hope of getting

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:51.800
My double-wide trailer

01:06:55.080 --> 01:06:56.300
There ain't no...

01:06:56.400 --> 01:06:57.526
Beck?

01:06:58.280 --> 01:06:59.580
Are you okay?

01:06:59.680 --> 01:07:00.860
Who is that?

01:07:00.960 --> 01:07:01.961
It's Jon.

01:07:02.640 --> 01:07:06.008
I'm not seeing too well, Jon.
I'm freezing.

01:07:07.720 --> 01:07:09.500
Mike's just behind me.

01:07:09.600 --> 01:07:11.860
He's back there with Yasuko.

01:07:11.960 --> 01:07:14.725
You'll be okay. Mike's right behind me.

01:07:14.840 --> 01:07:16.700
You're okay?

01:07:16.800 --> 01:07:18.131
I'll see you down there.

01:07:24.280 --> 01:07:25.980
There she is.

01:07:26.080 --> 01:07:27.081
Ten more steps, mate.

01:07:29.720 --> 01:07:31.940
Dig deep, Doug, dig deep.

01:07:32.040 --> 01:07:33.485
There you go.

01:07:44.960 --> 01:07:46.724
There ya go.

01:07:53.200 --> 01:07:54.247
You made it!

01:07:55.240 --> 01:07:56.241
Huh?

01:08:00.240 --> 01:08:01.605
You did it!

01:08:02.480 --> 01:08:05.006
Because of you, man.

01:08:14.080 --> 01:08:16.367
Guy to Rob, you read me, mate?

01:08:19.080 --> 01:08:21.127
Guy to Rob, are you there?

01:08:23.880 --> 01:08:25.689
For the school kids.

01:08:32.600 --> 01:08:35.080
Good on you, Doug. Come on.

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:37.020
Easy.

01:08:37.120 --> 01:08:38.645
Here, I got it.

01:08:45.200 --> 01:08:47.140
Come on, let's get you up.

01:08:47.240 --> 01:08:48.260
Need more O.

01:08:48.359 --> 01:08:49.340
No, Doug, we can't give you more O.

01:08:49.439 --> 01:08:53.001
We gotta get down to
the South Summit, come on.

01:08:57.319 --> 01:09:00.620
Guy Cotter to Everest Base Camp.
You there, Helen?

01:09:00.720 --> 01:09:02.939
Guy, this is Helen, how's it going?

01:09:03.040 --> 01:09:03.979
Yeah, fine.

01:09:04.080 --> 01:09:07.500
I got a clear view of the summit
and we've still got climbers up there.

01:09:07.600 --> 01:09:09.540
They're not any of ours, right?

01:09:09.640 --> 01:09:12.060
We got three up,
and they're all on their way down.

01:09:12.160 --> 01:09:13.700
Well, what are they doing there so late?

01:09:13.800 --> 01:09:16.279
They had a 2:00 turnaround time,
they're way past it.

01:09:17.160 --> 01:09:20.140
Yeah, we got cloud coming up
through the valley, it's a lot of it.

01:09:20.240 --> 01:09:22.720
Thanks, I'm calling them now, Guy.

01:09:26.160 --> 01:09:28.367
Rob, come in, this is Helen.

01:09:30.399 --> 01:09:32.607
Rob, come in, this is Helen.

01:09:39.920 --> 01:09:40.899
Whoa!

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:43.220
Easy, easy, easy, Dougie! There you go.

01:09:43.319 --> 01:09:44.765
There you go.

01:09:45.760 --> 01:09:48.127
Looking good. Round the corner.

01:09:49.479 --> 01:09:50.765
That's it.

01:09:53.640 --> 01:09:55.290
Rob, is that you?

01:09:56.440 --> 01:09:57.521
Beck?

01:09:58.360 --> 01:10:00.580
It's Mike, Beck.
What are you doing here?

01:10:00.680 --> 01:10:02.420
I can't see, it's bad.

01:10:02.520 --> 01:10:04.020
You guys all right?

01:10:04.120 --> 01:10:05.565
We got a problem with Beck.

01:10:05.680 --> 01:10:08.940
Hey, Mike, we're getting low on O.
We gotta move.

01:10:09.040 --> 01:10:10.580
Gonna get you to stand up, okay?

01:10:10.680 --> 01:10:11.700
I'll take Yasuko.

01:10:11.800 --> 01:10:12.881
That's it.

01:10:15.800 --> 01:10:17.086
I got you.

01:10:18.400 --> 01:10:19.811
You're okay.

01:10:22.120 --> 01:10:24.300
Doug, come on!

01:10:24.400 --> 01:10:25.686
Come on!

01:10:32.960 --> 01:10:34.200
I'm cold.

01:10:39.800 --> 01:10:42.340
Mike, Harold, Ang Dorjee,
put the brakes on, guys,

01:10:42.440 --> 01:10:44.044
we got a problem.

01:10:45.840 --> 01:10:47.420
We're out of gas, Doug.

01:10:47.520 --> 01:10:49.380
We're out of gas.
Need to keep moving, come on.

01:10:49.480 --> 01:10:50.481
Come on!

01:10:52.840 --> 01:10:55.730
Mike, Harold, do you copy?
I need someone...

01:10:56.400 --> 01:10:59.609
I need someone to come back up
with oxygen, over.

01:11:02.040 --> 01:11:04.520
Somebody, please, I'm begging you.

01:11:05.560 --> 01:11:07.483
Doug, come on, mate, come on!

01:11:09.240 --> 01:11:11.368
Harold, do you copy, over?

01:11:13.200 --> 01:11:15.567
Has anyone got eyes on Ang Dorjee?

01:11:16.760 --> 01:11:18.380
Mate, I've just had Ang Dorjee

01:11:18.480 --> 01:11:20.300
go past me, heading down, over.

01:11:20.400 --> 01:11:21.940
He's going down.

01:11:22.040 --> 01:11:23.724
Can you stop him,
can you turn him around?

01:11:23.840 --> 01:11:25.460
I need someone to come back up now.

01:11:25.560 --> 01:11:27.608
Hey, Ang Dorjee!

01:11:29.160 --> 01:11:30.161
Ang Dorjee!

01:11:31.440 --> 01:11:33.488
Base Camp, do you copy, over?

01:11:33.600 --> 01:11:35.620
Helen to Rob, go ahead.

01:11:35.720 --> 01:11:39.729
Helen, please. I need a bottle of gas
at the top of the Hillary Step.

01:11:40.400 --> 01:11:42.380
I can't get him down without it.

01:11:42.480 --> 01:11:44.209
I'm really stuffed.

01:11:45.120 --> 01:11:48.220
Understood that you
need a bottle of oxygen

01:11:48.320 --> 01:11:49.860
at the bottom of the Hillary Step.

01:11:49.960 --> 01:11:52.620
We are sending it up to you,
as soon as we can.

01:11:52.720 --> 01:11:55.166
At the top, at the top.

01:11:55.920 --> 01:11:57.780
The last thing I said to Ang Dorjee was

01:11:57.880 --> 01:12:00.660
"Please, leave two bottles of gas
at the South Summit."

01:12:00.760 --> 01:12:01.761
Yes.

01:12:02.440 --> 01:12:03.900
Copy that, Rob.

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:08.380
Boys, there's oxygen
at the South Summit, right?

01:12:08.480 --> 01:12:10.860
No, Rob, this is Harold.

01:12:10.960 --> 01:12:15.488
There's no oxygen at South Summit.

01:12:15.600 --> 01:12:17.250
Repeat, no O.

01:12:18.760 --> 01:12:22.020
Ang Dorjee stashed
four bottles there, Harold.

01:12:22.120 --> 01:12:23.281
Harold, where are you?

01:12:26.440 --> 01:12:28.020
Can you hear me, Harold?

01:12:28.120 --> 01:12:29.121
Harold!

01:12:30.160 --> 01:12:31.940
Harold, can you hear me?

01:12:32.040 --> 01:12:35.362
Think it'll take me about half an hour
to get back up to the South Summit.

01:12:39.760 --> 01:12:42.206
Okay, I'm coming.

01:12:44.520 --> 01:12:47.020
If you don't have oxygen, mate,
don't come up, don't come up.

01:12:47.120 --> 01:12:48.060
We're moving on.

01:12:48.160 --> 01:12:50.208
I'm coming up to you, Rob.

01:12:51.200 --> 01:12:53.168
Doug, come on, mate, come on!

01:12:57.880 --> 01:13:01.487
Rob, this is Base Camp.

01:13:02.480 --> 01:13:04.420
I copy you, Caro.

01:13:04.520 --> 01:13:06.807
Rob, can you get yourself down?

01:13:08.480 --> 01:13:10.164
Caro, we're not at that point, yet.

01:13:10.960 --> 01:13:13.088
Rob, can you let us
know who you're with?

01:13:14.680 --> 01:13:16.140
I'm with Doug.

01:13:16.240 --> 01:13:17.860
We're both listening.

01:13:17.960 --> 01:13:20.580
Come on, Dougie, come on, mate.
One more effort, come on.

01:13:20.680 --> 01:13:23.100
Rob, what is
Doug's state of consciousness?

01:13:23.200 --> 01:13:24.420
He's really weak.

01:13:24.520 --> 01:13:27.330
He collapsed after we ran out of oxygen.

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:31.846
Okay, give him eight milligrams
of dexamethasone.

01:13:32.880 --> 01:13:35.220
That's two tablets, Rob.

01:13:35.320 --> 01:13:36.321
Guy to Rob.

01:13:37.760 --> 01:13:39.489
Go ahead, Guy, I got you, mate.

01:13:39.600 --> 01:13:41.940
Rob, I suggest you get yourself down.

01:13:42.040 --> 01:13:43.580
You know you're doing no good up there.

01:13:43.680 --> 01:13:45.620
Now, we've got people that
we can send up to help Doug

01:13:45.720 --> 01:13:48.291
but you've gotta get yourself
down, do you understand?

01:13:48.400 --> 01:13:50.687
I mean, come on, man,
we're playing with a man's life here.

01:13:51.560 --> 01:13:54.291
There's no way I'm leaving Doug behind.

01:13:55.720 --> 01:13:57.900
We gotta keep moving, mate.

01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:00.207
No, we gotta keep moving,
we're in some trouble.

01:14:00.760 --> 01:14:02.740
Yeah, Helen's gonna need some help

01:14:02.840 --> 01:14:05.740
so I'm gonna try and make
my way back. Okay?

01:14:05.840 --> 01:14:07.683
All right. Go on.

01:14:17.280 --> 01:14:18.860
Hey, Scott.

01:14:18.960 --> 01:14:20.928
Scott! You okay?

01:14:25.640 --> 01:14:26.801
Lopsang.

01:14:27.560 --> 01:14:28.561
Lopsy!

01:14:30.960 --> 01:14:32.405
I'm done, pal.

01:14:34.240 --> 01:14:35.526
I'm done.

01:14:37.880 --> 01:14:40.724
You go, send Anatoli...

01:14:41.920 --> 01:14:44.321
Send Anatoli back with some O.

01:14:46.600 --> 01:14:47.620
Okay.

01:14:47.720 --> 01:14:49.500
- Go!
- Okay.

01:14:49.600 --> 01:14:52.444
I will send back Anatoli.

01:14:58.840 --> 01:15:00.820
- Let's go.
- You go down.

01:15:00.920 --> 01:15:01.967
No, mate.

01:15:02.720 --> 01:15:04.140
No, I'm not leaving you behind, Doug.

01:15:04.240 --> 01:15:05.860
- Come on!
- Gotta rest.

01:15:05.960 --> 01:15:07.900
No, Doug, come on,
you're coming with me!

01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:10.002
I need 10 good minutes, Doug, come on!

01:15:14.360 --> 01:15:16.340
Please, Dougie, come on, mate.

01:15:16.440 --> 01:15:18.727
Ten minutes.
We'll get to the bottom of the Step.

01:15:19.960 --> 01:15:21.220
Come on, this leg.

01:15:21.320 --> 01:15:23.402
This leg, Dougie, come on!

01:15:24.040 --> 01:15:25.326
Come on.

01:15:26.040 --> 01:15:27.451
There we go.

01:15:47.280 --> 01:15:48.281
Oh, no.

01:15:48.840 --> 01:15:49.887
Oh, no.

01:15:52.480 --> 01:15:55.643
Hold that down. Come on, come on!
Get those chairs!

01:16:36.520 --> 01:16:38.900
No, no, no, no. Come on, Dougie!

01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:41.048
Doug, let's go, hurry up!

01:17:16.920 --> 01:17:20.540
Doug! I'm gonna go
to the South Summit to get oxygen.

01:17:20.640 --> 01:17:24.180
Okay, mate? Gonna find oxygen.

01:17:24.280 --> 01:17:26.380
But you've gotta stay here!

01:17:26.480 --> 01:17:28.460
Okay? Stay here!

01:17:28.560 --> 01:17:30.562
Don't move! I'll be back!

01:17:55.480 --> 01:17:56.766
Hey, Rob.

01:18:35.720 --> 01:18:40.180
Beck! Stop! That's the wrong way!

01:18:40.280 --> 01:18:41.300
Stop!

01:18:41.400 --> 01:18:43.607
Back! Turn back!

01:19:00.880 --> 01:19:02.370
Beck, easy!

01:19:13.440 --> 01:19:14.566
Rob!

01:19:18.440 --> 01:19:19.646
Harold!

01:19:20.320 --> 01:19:21.367
Harold!

01:19:33.680 --> 01:19:34.886
Rob!

01:19:37.560 --> 01:19:39.608
- Harold?
- I've got oxygen!

01:19:40.240 --> 01:19:43.926
Here, I found some half-empty ones.

01:19:45.640 --> 01:19:47.130
Where's Doug?

01:19:48.760 --> 01:19:50.205
Doug's gone.

01:19:51.640 --> 01:19:52.971
He's what?

01:19:53.360 --> 01:19:54.407
Gone!

01:20:12.600 --> 01:20:14.260
Camp Four's that way!

01:20:14.360 --> 01:20:15.407
Get up!

01:20:16.080 --> 01:20:17.411
Let's go!

01:20:18.720 --> 01:20:21.405
Come on! Beck!

01:20:29.920 --> 01:20:31.968
I'll get help!

01:21:09.840 --> 01:21:11.046
Here!

01:21:17.120 --> 01:21:18.485
- Toli!
- Where are the others?

01:21:18.600 --> 01:21:19.601
They're still out there.

01:21:27.640 --> 01:21:30.020
Jon! I need help!

01:21:30.120 --> 01:21:31.121
What?

01:21:31.240 --> 01:21:34.380
They're out there, I need help!

01:21:34.480 --> 01:21:37.006
I can't see, Toli.

01:21:37.120 --> 01:21:38.645
I'm snow-blind.

01:21:39.480 --> 01:21:41.005
Beck, Doug.

01:21:42.320 --> 01:21:43.660
They need help.

01:21:43.760 --> 01:21:45.762
They're still outside...

01:21:47.640 --> 01:21:50.325
I go find them! You stay here!

01:22:05.320 --> 01:22:06.321
Good job.

01:22:26.760 --> 01:22:29.580
Toli! Sandy needs O!

01:22:29.680 --> 01:22:31.409
Sandy, here!

01:22:34.400 --> 01:22:36.721
- Can you walk?
- I can't.

01:22:38.520 --> 01:22:40.204
I'll come back!

01:22:41.720 --> 01:22:42.881
I'll stay!

01:22:49.480 --> 01:22:51.100
Here, give me that, come on.

01:22:51.200 --> 01:22:52.940
It won't go, it's frozen!

01:22:53.040 --> 01:22:54.405
Take this.

01:22:55.600 --> 01:22:56.840
The glove.

01:22:58.400 --> 01:22:59.731
I'm sorry.

01:23:12.280 --> 01:23:13.805
Come on, mate.

01:23:14.640 --> 01:23:15.880
Come on, Harold.

01:23:18.400 --> 01:23:20.289
Thanks for coming back.

01:23:41.520 --> 01:23:42.500
Hello, Base Camp.

01:23:42.600 --> 01:23:43.860
Helen, it's Jan.

01:23:43.960 --> 01:23:47.100
Why haven't I heard from you?
Why isn't anybody calling me?

01:23:47.200 --> 01:23:50.682
They've been hit by a storm, Jan.
It's really bad.

01:23:52.560 --> 01:23:53.766
Where is he?

01:23:53.880 --> 01:23:55.803
We don't know, exactly, but

01:23:56.440 --> 01:23:58.500
he was still on the summit at 4:00.

01:23:58.600 --> 01:24:00.762
Oh, no. Can he get down?

01:24:01.560 --> 01:24:03.642
Rob can, but Doug can't.

01:24:05.160 --> 01:24:07.820
There's at least 13
people stranded up there

01:24:07.920 --> 01:24:10.764
and, well, the storm is getting worse.

01:24:15.320 --> 01:24:16.980
Get Ang Dorjee up there.

01:24:17.080 --> 01:24:18.127
He'll bring them down.

01:24:19.360 --> 01:24:21.220
- Helen, do you understand?
- Helen! Give me an update!

01:24:21.320 --> 01:24:23.800
Get Ang Dorjee up there.

01:24:24.560 --> 01:24:26.300
Jan, yeah, we will get him.

01:24:26.400 --> 01:24:29.100
And I will call you,
the minute I hear from him.

01:24:29.200 --> 01:24:30.700
As soon as I hear from him.

01:24:30.800 --> 01:24:31.900
- Thanks, Helen.
- All right?

01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:33.001
Okay.

01:24:33.600 --> 01:24:35.220
- Where is he?
- Guy, I haven't heard from him.

01:24:35.320 --> 01:24:36.340
Okay, I'll get him.

01:24:36.440 --> 01:24:38.044
I've been trying.

01:24:38.160 --> 01:24:40.140
- Guy...
- Just hang on, hang on.

01:24:40.240 --> 01:24:42.380
Rob? It's Guy, where are you?

01:24:42.480 --> 01:24:44.380
Guy, I've been doing that
for the last two hours.

01:24:44.480 --> 01:24:46.482
All right. Rob, it's Guy.

01:24:47.240 --> 01:24:48.969
- Just keep your energy, mate.
- Helen.

01:24:49.720 --> 01:24:52.620
Once you catch a break,
you move, you know the drill.

01:24:52.720 --> 01:24:55.620
We've got a stash of oxygen
on the South Col.

01:24:55.720 --> 01:24:56.700
Whoever needs it can have it.

01:24:56.800 --> 01:24:57.820
That's the way, thank you.

01:24:57.920 --> 01:24:59.580
Mal's team are gonna
go up, they're gonna

01:24:59.680 --> 01:25:01.580
mount a search as soon as they can.

01:25:01.680 --> 01:25:04.540
Anyone who's going, we're gonna
leave at dawn, weather permitting.

01:25:04.640 --> 01:25:06.780
- Of course, Helen. At dawn.
- That's great, David.

01:25:06.880 --> 01:25:08.740
Go let Ed know what's going on,
I'll be right behind you.

01:25:08.840 --> 01:25:11.060
Camp Four, come in.

01:25:11.160 --> 01:25:13.180
Rob. Rob, can you hear me?

01:25:13.280 --> 01:25:15.460
David Breashears has a stash of oxygen

01:25:15.560 --> 01:25:17.801
at the South Col that we can use.

01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:22.364
All right, mate, we're organizing
a team, we're coming to get you.

01:25:41.120 --> 01:25:42.246
Hot.

01:25:45.240 --> 01:25:46.605
Burning up.

01:26:07.120 --> 01:26:08.360
No, no.

01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:11.081
Yasuko.

01:26:14.600 --> 01:26:15.806
Sandy?

01:26:23.080 --> 01:26:24.411
Come on!

01:27:19.680 --> 01:27:23.207
Rob, talk to me, please. Pick up.

01:27:28.240 --> 01:27:30.129
Pick up, mate, please.

01:27:57.960 --> 01:27:59.580
Is there any word on the others?

01:27:59.680 --> 01:28:04.120
Anatoli managed to get three clients
back from the South Col last night,

01:28:04.520 --> 01:28:07.060
but Beck and Yasuko are still out there.

01:28:07.160 --> 01:28:10.060
They're trying to mount a search but
everyone who's been up there is exhausted.

01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:15.650
Rob, is that you?

01:28:16.560 --> 01:28:19.723
Rob, where are you?
We're sending people for you.

01:28:20.680 --> 01:28:22.603
Rob, this is Base Camp.

01:28:25.840 --> 01:28:27.900
I can't... I can't move...

01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:30.731
I can't move anymore. Anymore.

01:28:32.560 --> 01:28:34.260
Hey, mate. Yeah, I know.
I know, mate. I know.

01:28:34.360 --> 01:28:36.460
But you gotta keep on moving.

01:28:36.560 --> 01:28:38.300
My hands...

01:28:38.400 --> 01:28:41.085
I can't feel my hands, they're frozen.

01:28:44.240 --> 01:28:46.242
Gotta de-ice my mask.

01:28:46.920 --> 01:28:49.380
I gotta de-ice my mask.

01:28:49.480 --> 01:28:51.940
That's good. Yeah, you gotta get
that mask working. Yeah?

01:28:52.040 --> 01:28:55.900
The sun's gonna come up and, you know,
you can get warmer, you can get moving.

01:28:56.000 --> 01:28:57.820
- Guy.
- Yeah?

01:28:57.920 --> 01:29:00.780
Guy. Harold was here.

01:29:00.880 --> 01:29:01.980
Where's he gone?

01:29:02.080 --> 01:29:04.321
Rob, is Doug with you?

01:29:06.360 --> 01:29:07.820
Harold...

01:29:07.920 --> 01:29:10.810
Doug... Doug's gone.

01:29:13.040 --> 01:29:14.451
Harold's gone.

01:29:18.280 --> 01:29:20.442
I'm gonna need a little help.

01:29:21.960 --> 01:29:23.849
Okay, Rob, you gotta get yourself down.

01:29:23.960 --> 01:29:25.769
Where are you?

01:29:30.760 --> 01:29:31.921
Guy...

01:29:32.400 --> 01:29:34.340
I'm in that little...

01:29:34.440 --> 01:29:37.603
In that little dip just
below the South Summit.

01:29:38.400 --> 01:29:39.700
All right. You can do this.

01:29:39.800 --> 01:29:41.006
You just gotta, you know,

01:29:41.120 --> 01:29:44.260
pull yourself up out of that dip
and slide the rest of the way.

01:29:44.360 --> 01:29:46.660
Guy, send the boys.

01:29:46.760 --> 01:29:48.205
Okay?

01:29:48.320 --> 01:29:50.700
I'm gonna need a little help.

01:29:50.800 --> 01:29:53.460
We've got some Sherpas
coming up there with tea, oxygen.

01:29:53.560 --> 01:29:55.620
You just gotta come on down, mate.

01:29:55.720 --> 01:29:57.484
Yeah? Come on down.

01:29:59.480 --> 01:30:00.527
Rob.

01:30:05.800 --> 01:30:07.700
Can you patch Jan through?

01:30:07.800 --> 01:30:09.060
To Rob?

01:30:09.160 --> 01:30:10.500
Patch her through, yeah?

01:30:10.600 --> 01:30:12.260
Let's just try it. Let's just...

01:30:12.360 --> 01:30:14.886
Put the sat phone next to the radio.

01:30:16.080 --> 01:30:19.482
Yeah, if anyone can motivate him
to move, then Jan will.

01:30:20.240 --> 01:30:21.980
Guy to Rob.

01:30:22.080 --> 01:30:23.491
Guy to Rob.

01:30:26.480 --> 01:30:28.608
Guy to Rob. Can you read me?

01:30:33.960 --> 01:30:35.260
- We're just getting...
- Rob, are you there?

01:30:35.360 --> 01:30:37.522
- We're getting him now.
- Here.

01:30:39.320 --> 01:30:41.004
Rob, this is Helen.

01:30:43.200 --> 01:30:44.281
Copy.

01:30:44.960 --> 01:30:47.042
Rob, I've got Jan for you.

01:30:49.600 --> 01:30:51.100
My Jan?

01:30:51.200 --> 01:30:52.180
Yeah, she's just here.

01:30:52.280 --> 01:30:53.580
Jan, you're on.

01:30:53.680 --> 01:30:54.841
Okay.

01:30:55.840 --> 01:30:58.241
Hi, sweetheart, how are you doing?

01:31:01.720 --> 01:31:03.220
Hi, my love.

01:31:03.320 --> 01:31:04.321
I'm a bit...

01:31:04.840 --> 01:31:06.171
A bit cold

01:31:07.320 --> 01:31:09.100
but I'm okay.

01:31:09.200 --> 01:31:10.900
I know you are.

01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:13.207
But the sun'll warm you soon.

01:31:14.080 --> 01:31:15.127
Sweetheart?

01:31:15.880 --> 01:31:17.803
You've gotta get moving.

01:31:18.360 --> 01:31:20.886
You've gotta come on down.

01:31:21.640 --> 01:31:23.085
My hands

01:31:26.040 --> 01:31:27.405
are frozen.

01:31:30.720 --> 01:31:32.529
My feet are frozen.

01:31:33.880 --> 01:31:37.180
We're sending people
up to you with tea and O's.

01:31:37.280 --> 01:31:40.489
But you've gotta get moving.
Rob? Can you hear me?

01:31:41.080 --> 01:31:43.380
You've gotta get your circulation going.

01:31:43.480 --> 01:31:45.050
Okay, my love.

01:31:45.760 --> 01:31:48.764
You do it... You do it right now.

01:31:51.320 --> 01:31:52.731
I love you.

01:31:54.040 --> 01:31:55.326
Over and out.

01:32:05.760 --> 01:32:07.444
Come on, Rob.

01:32:57.560 --> 01:32:59.369
We can't carry them.

01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:02.780
It's not possible.

01:33:02.880 --> 01:33:03.881
It's gonna...

01:33:06.120 --> 01:33:08.060
It's gonna take all we got

01:33:08.160 --> 01:33:10.242
just to get ourselves down.

01:33:12.480 --> 01:33:14.323
I don't wanna die, man.

01:33:18.880 --> 01:33:21.406
Helen, it's Mike here. Do you copy?

01:33:22.640 --> 01:33:24.260
Come in, Mike. What do you got?

01:33:24.360 --> 01:33:27.220
Yasuko and Beck

01:33:27.320 --> 01:33:29.527
did not make it back to camp.

01:33:34.360 --> 01:33:37.648
Okay, Mike. Thanks for letting us know.

01:34:11.720 --> 01:34:13.006
Meg?

01:34:15.920 --> 01:34:17.046
Bub?

01:34:49.960 --> 01:34:51.644
Helen Base Camp. Helen Base Camp.

01:34:52.520 --> 01:34:54.124
Helen Base Camp.

01:34:55.240 --> 01:34:57.020
Ang Dorjee, this is Helen.

01:34:57.120 --> 01:34:58.724
We have to turn back!

01:34:59.360 --> 01:35:01.442
There is a very bad storm again.

01:35:03.280 --> 01:35:05.260
- Your call, Ang Dorjee.
- Sorry.

01:35:05.360 --> 01:35:08.300
We'll try to again
when the storm's passed.

01:35:08.400 --> 01:35:11.688
We'll leave some tea
and oxygen here. Sorry.

01:35:18.880 --> 01:35:21.008
We have to tell Rob they're not coming.

01:35:22.760 --> 01:35:24.125
Okay.

01:35:33.280 --> 01:35:34.380
Hey, Rob, it's Guy, mate.

01:35:34.480 --> 01:35:35.766
Guy.

01:35:37.720 --> 01:35:40.530
Can't stop shaking, mate.

01:35:41.760 --> 01:35:44.684
The boys have hit a bit of high wind.

01:35:44.800 --> 01:35:47.724
And your best shot is
gonna be to get lower.

01:35:50.480 --> 01:35:52.289
Let me think about it.

01:35:54.920 --> 01:35:57.764
I think I can hang
out here another night.

01:36:03.160 --> 01:36:05.640
We'll try again first thing, okay?

01:37:14.400 --> 01:37:16.926
- Helen?
- Yeah.

01:37:17.600 --> 01:37:19.648
Yeah, he's still there.

01:37:20.640 --> 01:37:23.086
He's just below the South Summit.

01:37:23.760 --> 01:37:28.340
He's got oxygen, but it's iced up.

01:37:28.440 --> 01:37:31.523
We don't know whether
he's been able to free it.

01:37:33.720 --> 01:37:35.660
Is anybody with him?

01:37:35.760 --> 01:37:37.205
No.

01:37:37.760 --> 01:37:39.046
No.

01:37:39.920 --> 01:37:41.060
You have to get him down before dark.

01:37:41.160 --> 01:37:43.260
He won't survive another night.

01:37:43.360 --> 01:37:44.600
We know.

01:37:46.120 --> 01:37:49.044
But the storm's come back, real bad.

01:37:50.560 --> 01:37:53.420
We can't get anyone up to him tonight.

01:37:53.520 --> 01:37:54.806
We tried.

01:37:58.640 --> 01:38:00.961
He might as well be on the moon.

01:38:03.640 --> 01:38:04.641
Uh...

01:38:06.960 --> 01:38:09.380
Can you put me on with him again?

01:38:09.480 --> 01:38:10.811
Of course.

01:38:14.120 --> 01:38:16.168
Guy, get Rob.

01:38:20.600 --> 01:38:22.170
Hey, Rob, it's Guy.

01:38:23.640 --> 01:38:25.608
I've got Jan for you.

01:38:26.320 --> 01:38:30.006
Hold on. Give me a sec.

01:38:44.680 --> 01:38:45.806
Okay.

01:38:54.800 --> 01:38:56.370
Hi, sweetheart.

01:38:57.760 --> 01:38:59.364
How are you?

01:39:02.120 --> 01:39:04.441
I'm thinking about you.

01:39:08.360 --> 01:39:10.010
You sound good.

01:39:12.680 --> 01:39:14.523
Are you warm, my love?

01:39:15.600 --> 01:39:17.967
I might have a little frostbite.

01:39:20.320 --> 01:39:23.244
I'm looking forward
to making it all better.

01:39:26.200 --> 01:39:28.362
I can't wait for you to come home.

01:39:31.720 --> 01:39:33.085
How's Sarah?

01:39:34.040 --> 01:39:35.405
Sarah?

01:39:36.320 --> 01:39:37.685
Yeah.

01:39:39.360 --> 01:39:41.249
Yeah, Sarah's good.

01:39:43.080 --> 01:39:45.686
Will you call her that for me?

01:39:46.080 --> 01:39:47.809
Yes, I will.

01:39:50.560 --> 01:39:53.564
I don't think I'm gonna get to meet her.

01:39:57.160 --> 01:39:59.003
I'm so sorry.

01:40:03.840 --> 01:40:05.410
Don't say that.

01:40:07.760 --> 01:40:10.060
If anyone can make it, you can.

01:40:10.160 --> 01:40:11.685
Remember?

01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:17.445
I love you.

01:40:19.240 --> 01:40:21.766
Please don't worry too much.

01:40:28.120 --> 01:40:30.168
Good night, my love.

01:40:43.880 --> 01:40:45.803
I love you, Rob.

01:40:49.960 --> 01:40:51.485
I love you.

01:44:15.480 --> 01:44:17.005
Beck?

01:44:20.160 --> 01:44:22.083
Helen, it's Mike here.

01:44:22.680 --> 01:44:24.444
Helen, do you copy?

01:44:25.000 --> 01:44:26.580
Mike, come in.

01:44:26.680 --> 01:44:28.420
Beck's still alive.

01:44:28.520 --> 01:44:30.660
He walked himself into camp.

01:44:30.760 --> 01:44:35.162
David Breashears and the IMAX team
are gonna get him down to Camp One.

01:44:37.600 --> 01:44:39.090
Thanks, Mike.

01:44:43.080 --> 01:44:46.402
We don't even know how, but he is alive.

01:44:47.400 --> 01:44:50.980
The thing is, Peach,
we can't get him down the Icefall.

01:44:51.080 --> 01:44:52.340
Oh, no, I'll get him down.

01:44:52.440 --> 01:44:54.620
I'll get him down. Okay.

01:44:54.720 --> 01:44:57.620
Okay, what do we need?
We need a helicopter, right?

01:44:57.720 --> 01:45:00.460
Yeah, but they can't take
a helicopter up that high

01:45:00.560 --> 01:45:02.244
because the air is too thin.

01:45:02.800 --> 01:45:05.620
We should try,
but it is one heck of a risk.

01:45:05.720 --> 01:45:07.460
And he's not in a good way, Peach,

01:45:07.560 --> 01:45:09.767
so I don't want you to get
your hopes up too high.

01:45:15.400 --> 01:45:17.129
One step at a time.

01:45:20.440 --> 01:45:21.620
- You gotta keep moving.
- Tired.

01:45:21.720 --> 01:45:22.801
- I know.
- I'm tired.

01:45:22.920 --> 01:45:24.922
I know you are. Come on.

01:45:27.240 --> 01:45:28.890
Slow and steady.

01:45:30.560 --> 01:45:32.900
Come on, keep moving.

01:45:33.000 --> 01:45:34.460
Yes, I'd like the number

01:45:34.560 --> 01:45:37.245
of the American Embassy
in Kathmandu, Nepal.

01:45:37.880 --> 01:45:40.140
- Yes, Nepal.
- Ambassador, please.

01:45:40.240 --> 01:45:41.660
No, sweets, I can't hold.

01:45:41.760 --> 01:45:44.180
No, you listen, sir,
my husband's already died once

01:45:44.280 --> 01:45:45.660
as you'll have seen the news.

01:45:45.760 --> 01:45:49.647
Trust me, having him die a second time
is not gonna play well on CNN.

01:45:50.280 --> 01:45:52.009
There we go, buddy.

01:45:53.080 --> 01:45:55.003
That's it, all right.

01:46:00.240 --> 01:46:01.220
Mike.

01:46:01.320 --> 01:46:02.321
Mmm-hmm.

01:46:03.400 --> 01:46:04.460
How you doing?

01:46:04.560 --> 01:46:06.642
Oh, you know, fair to middling.

01:46:07.560 --> 01:46:08.971
Warming up?

01:46:09.960 --> 01:46:11.610
I'm not sure yet.

01:46:12.320 --> 01:46:14.800
Look like you are, a little bit.

01:46:16.800 --> 01:46:18.643
How's Rob doing?

01:46:21.600 --> 01:46:23.887
Rob's still up there right now.

01:46:26.440 --> 01:46:28.488
And Doug? What's he up to?

01:46:33.600 --> 01:46:35.489
Doug's gone, Beck.

01:46:51.440 --> 01:46:54.100
I don't know, no one's ever tried
to fly higher than Base Camp before,

01:46:54.200 --> 01:46:55.980
they're gonna give it a go.

01:46:56.080 --> 01:46:58.620
You find an LZ, just mark it out
with whatever you can.

01:46:58.720 --> 01:47:01.180
Okay, worth a try. Thanks, Guy.

01:47:01.280 --> 01:47:02.700
- Yeah?
- Grab a Gatorade.

01:47:02.800 --> 01:47:05.060
Got a chopper coming in,
we need to make an LZ.

01:47:05.160 --> 01:47:07.322
We got a chopper coming in!

01:47:08.680 --> 01:47:10.523
Clear everyone back to the tents!

01:47:11.320 --> 01:47:12.242
Thanks.

01:47:12.360 --> 01:47:14.169
Keep it clear,
keep this whole area clear.

01:47:14.280 --> 01:47:15.260
Back away.

01:47:15.360 --> 01:47:17.328
Come on, come on.

01:47:22.080 --> 01:47:23.525
Army 45, keep updating.

01:47:24.200 --> 01:47:26.407
Lukla Tower, we're doing fine.

01:47:32.000 --> 01:47:34.082
It's not possible!

01:47:34.360 --> 01:47:36.408
You land here, we'll never get back up.

01:47:41.720 --> 01:47:43.140
Gonna kill us!

01:47:43.240 --> 01:47:45.049
Okay, Major, let's go back.

01:48:03.840 --> 01:48:04.780
That's it!

01:48:04.880 --> 01:48:07.460
We can't get any more out.
It's as light as we're gonna get it!

01:48:07.560 --> 01:48:09.260
Time to go then, Major.

01:48:23.280 --> 01:48:25.248
Right here, right here!

01:48:27.600 --> 01:48:29.489
Come on! You can do it!

01:48:58.520 --> 01:49:01.126
Come on, buddy. You're nearly there.

01:49:04.480 --> 01:49:06.050
Okay, come on.

01:49:09.040 --> 01:49:10.660
One person. Only one person.

01:49:10.760 --> 01:49:13.580
Yeah, it's just him, just one! There.

01:49:13.680 --> 01:49:15.125
There you go.

01:49:18.360 --> 01:49:19.771
You're good!

01:49:20.360 --> 01:49:23.540
I'm going to lift the tail up,
to fly us over the edge.

01:49:23.640 --> 01:49:25.820
Fall a bit, until
the blades catch on the air.

01:49:25.920 --> 01:49:27.100
Is that okay with you?

01:49:27.200 --> 01:49:29.202
- I'm with you.
- Good man.

01:50:48.720 --> 01:50:51.690
Get yourself inside, go on.

01:50:54.840 --> 01:50:56.080
Oh, Anatoli.

01:51:02.440 --> 01:51:05.260
I'm so sorry, Helen.

01:51:05.360 --> 01:51:07.567
Come on, let's get you inside.

01:51:29.440 --> 01:51:30.771
Hi, Peachy.

01:51:35.760 --> 01:51:36.966
Hey.

01:51:49.920 --> 01:51:52.446
Thank you so much, darling.
