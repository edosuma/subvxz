Previously, on <i>Royal Pains</i>...

00:02.125 --> 00:04.125
- Paige Collins, will you marry me?
- Yes!

00:04.150 --> 00:06.150
You think you'll be able
to provide for Paige

00:06.175 --> 00:08.175
in the style to which she is accustomed?

00:10.800 --> 00:12.300
Maybe you should talk to someone.

00:13.725 --> 00:15.025
Wait... wait...

00:15.050 --> 00:16.050
Keep going...

00:16.075 --> 00:17.275
<i>Das ist ihr nicht!</i>

00:17.300 --> 00:18.500
What does that mean to you?

00:18.525 --> 00:21.025
<i>Es ist nicht ihr</i>... It's not her.

00:21.050 --> 00:23.550
My parents feel entitled to restitution.

00:23.575 --> 00:25.175
But parents cut me off, Raj.

00:25.200 --> 00:27.600
I can't even afford the gratuity on this!

00:27.625 --> 00:28.825
Thank you again.

00:28.850 --> 00:31.250
Don't thank me. We need you around here.

00:31.275 --> 00:32.475
I want to grow Hankmed.

00:32.500 --> 00:34.700
I've heard these kinds
of suggestions before...

00:34.725 --> 00:36.525
And we're talking about
a whole new level here,

00:36.550 --> 00:38.650
I have a fully fleshed-out business plan.

00:38.675 --> 00:40.475
Is this about you wanting
a bigger business,

00:40.501 --> 00:41.901
or is this about you wanting

00:41.903 --> 00:44.037
to make this a bigger business for Paige?

00:50.011 --> 00:53.580
No, thank you for hosting
such a lovely party.

00:53.582 --> 00:55.582
Uh, wonderful, wonderful...

00:55.584 --> 00:56.583

00:57.919 --> 00:59.586
it's a beautiful, exquisite home.

00:59.588 --> 01:02.255
I'm going to assume that you're
quite a wealthy man.

01:02.257 --> 01:04.724
Would you agree to that?

01:04.726 --> 01:09.095
Now, I would like to guess the
exact amount of your net worth.

01:09.097 --> 01:10.397
Hello, sir.

01:10.399 --> 01:12.132
Hello.

01:12.134 --> 01:14.367
What are you doing with these?

01:14.369 --> 01:16.469
I am promoting Hankmed
in an understated way.

01:16.471 --> 01:17.937
That's the way you prefer me
to do it, isn't it?

01:17.939 --> 01:19.239
I guess, but...

01:19.241 --> 01:21.307
This promotion is so understated,

01:21.309 --> 01:22.642
no one even knows it's happening.

01:22.644 --> 01:24.144
It's total stealth marketing.

01:24.146 --> 01:25.712
God, this Pappy Van Winkle

01:27.249 --> 01:28.715
I told you.

01:28.717 --> 01:29.949
Oh, I added some footage
of the Jitney crash

01:29.951 --> 01:30.950
I found on YouTube.

01:30.952 --> 01:32.152
I am so grateful

01:32.154 --> 01:34.254
for that horrible, horrible accident.

01:34.256 --> 01:35.255
Evan...

01:35.257 --> 01:36.489
Just because, you know,

01:36.491 --> 01:37.824
we've gotten a lot of business out of it.

01:37.826 --> 01:39.159

Uh, I thought it would impress the girls.

04:53.915 --> 04:56.015
Ah, the basis of so many things we do.

04:56.017 --> 04:57.350
Heh, I was wrong.

Magic just made them think I was weird.

- "Er." Weirder.
- Oh.

05:01.689 --> 05:03.222
Unfortunately, by the time
I figured that out,

05:03.224 --> 05:04.891
I had already gotten bitten by the bug.

05:04.893 --> 05:06.826
I thought butter was for burns.

05:06.828 --> 05:09.128
Common misconception.

05:09.130 --> 05:11.297
Butter traps heat in the tissue,

05:11.299 --> 05:12.665
which risks causing more damage

05:12.667 --> 05:14.167
and increases the chances of infection.

Not... not professionally,
of course, but...

05:23.678 --> 05:26.646
Two years ago,
I was doing magic part-time.

05:26.648 --> 05:28.681
While I was selling orthopedic shoes

05:28.683 --> 05:30.016
in Massapequa.

05:30.018 --> 05:31.317
Oof.

05:31.319 --> 05:33.586
And then, I started doing custom escapes

05:33.588 --> 05:34.620
at private parties

05:34.622 --> 05:35.922
for high-end clients.

05:35.924 --> 05:37.990

08:26.094 --> 08:28.461
is for me to pay back Raj's parents.

08:50.018 --> 08:51.717
Now, was that so hard to say?

08:51.719 --> 08:52.952
Yes.

08:52.954 --> 08:54.954
Look... it's your secret.

08:54.956 --> 08:57.323
And... I'll keep it.

08:57.325 --> 08:58.858
I just think that the longer I do,

08:58.860 --> 09:00.326
the more awkward things could get.

09:00.328 --> 09:01.527
It won't be forever.

09:01.529 --> 09:03.929
Just until I get my financial
house in order.

09:03.931 --> 09:06.432
And I give you my word,
it will not be awkward.

09:06.434 --> 09:09.402
What won't?

09:09.404 --> 09:12.071
Nothing.

09:14.000 --> 09:20.074
Learn the unknown words of this movie
--->   Skeebdo.com

09:49.342 --> 09:51.977
Oh, I'm so sorry, I'm s...

09:51.979 --> 09:53.112
[Sputters]

09:53.114 --> 09:54.647
Puh! I'm sorry.

09:54.649 --> 09:56.348
Oh, God, my stomach.

09:56.350 --> 09:58.150
- Gah!
- What the hell are you doing?

09:58.152 --> 09:59.752
I'm sorry. Okay, look.

09:59.754 --> 10:01.954
I just really want
to talk to you for two seconds

10:01.956 --> 10:03.622
about The <i>Today</i> Show, okay?

10:03.624 --> 10:06.692
Seriously? That's why
you're jumping on top of me?

10:06.694 --> 10:09.361
Yeah, k... kind of.

10:09.363 --> 10:10.863
Gee, I missed it this morning. All right.

10:10.865 --> 10:14.333
All right, tell me,
who was the musical guest?

10:14.335 --> 10:16.502
So... you're not Matt Lauer.

10:16.504 --> 10:18.604
No. And you're not Natalie Morales.

10:18.606 --> 10:20.372
That's it. We got that cleared up now?

10:20.374 --> 10:21.774
- Yeah.
- Can I finish my swim?

10:21.776 --> 10:23.576
Sure... sure.

10:23.578 --> 10:24.977
Have a good... lap.

10:32.586 --> 10:34.086
Andy?

10:35.889 --> 10:39.391
[Door creaks]

10:48.368 --> 10:49.835
[Chains jingling]

11:03.283 --> 11:04.450
Andy?

11:07.053 --> 11:08.220
Help!

11:08.222 --> 11:09.588
[Chains jingling]

11:09.590 --> 11:11.490
Andy?

11:11.492 --> 11:13.259
Okay... okay...

11:15.195 --> 11:16.495
[Grunts]

11:18.598 --> 11:19.665
Is there a key?

11:19.667 --> 11:21.133
No! No, there's not.

11:21.135 --> 11:22.401
All right, hang on.

11:22.403 --> 11:23.936
I'm gonna get you out of there.

11:26.740 --> 11:28.107
Good. Good.

11:36.750 --> 11:39.018
Are you okay?
[Gasping]

11:40.208 --> 11:42.642
Oh, my God. What is wrong with me?

11:42.944 --> 11:44.878
- What is wrong with me?
- I don't know yet.

11:44.880 --> 11:46.646
I'm not seeing any arrhythmias
on your halter results,

11:46.648 --> 11:48.314
so it's probably not your heart.

11:48.316 --> 11:50.316
All you've got is a slightly
elevated heart rate

11:50.318 --> 11:51.751
while you were trapped.

11:51.753 --> 11:53.520
That's the thing.
I shouldn't have been trapped.

11:53.522 --> 11:55.188
I built this crate.

11:55.190 --> 11:57.323
I mean, it was like
I was in the chimney again.

11:57.325 --> 11:59.359
Paralyzed by fear.

11:59.361 --> 12:00.727
All right, well, then let's start

12:00.729 --> 12:02.562
by checking your reflexes. Here you go.

12:04.665 --> 12:06.066
Okay, lie down for me, please.

12:06.068 --> 12:08.701
All right.

12:08.703 --> 12:09.869
[Groans]

12:09.871 --> 12:12.005
[Sighs]

12:12.007 --> 12:13.173
Ooh!

12:13.175 --> 12:14.507
Oh ho. Whoa ho.

12:14.509 --> 12:16.076
[Chuckles]
Ooh.

12:16.078 --> 12:17.911
[Laughing]
That tickles.

12:17.913 --> 12:19.779
As long as it makes your toes flex.

12:19.781 --> 12:21.114
If they were to extend, it could indicate

12:21.116 --> 12:24.250
a lesion in your spinal cord
or cerebral cortex.

12:24.252 --> 12:26.419
Aren't you a big bag of sunshine?

12:26.421 --> 12:28.555
[Chuckles]
Lift your shirt, please.

12:28.557 --> 12:30.457
Yesterday, you mentioned
you take a diuretic

12:30.459 --> 12:31.825
to lose weight before an escape.

12:31.827 --> 12:33.560
I know, it's not a six pack.

12:33.562 --> 12:35.562
No, no, no, no. I didn't mean that.

12:35.564 --> 12:38.064
I need to test the quadrants
of your abdominals.

12:39.467 --> 12:41.234
All right, you can sit up now.

12:41.236 --> 12:43.269
What I'm getting at is,

12:43.271 --> 12:45.705
if you're feeling
the kind of pressure to perform

12:45.707 --> 12:47.607
that's got you taking water pills

12:47.609 --> 12:49.742
and freezing up in situations
you've rehearsed,

12:49.744 --> 12:53.079
then maybe what you have
is an anxiety disorder.

12:53.081 --> 12:55.148
Okay... yes, I...

12:55.150 --> 12:57.217
I have anxiety in my everyday life.

12:57.219 --> 13:00.186
But it's not supposed to spill over

13:00.188 --> 13:01.454
into my act.

13:01.456 --> 13:02.755
My act is rehearsed.

13:02.757 --> 13:04.157
There's no surprises.

13:04.159 --> 13:05.725
There's nothing to fear.

13:05.727 --> 13:07.560
I'm actually more comfortable
in front of an audience

13:07.562 --> 13:10.263
than I am one on one.

13:10.265 --> 13:11.965
- You okay, buddy?
- Hmm.

13:11.967 --> 13:14.300
It's funny. I'm the exact opposite.

13:14.302 --> 13:15.969
Yeah, most people are.

13:15.971 --> 13:18.972
But to me, that... that's the real magic

13:18.974 --> 13:20.006
of my act.

13:20.008 --> 13:22.275
That I can transform this...

13:22.277 --> 13:24.711
introverted ex-shoe salesman

13:24.713 --> 13:26.546
into the kind of polished performer

13:26.548 --> 13:29.015
that rich, successful people,
they clap for.

13:29.017 --> 13:30.583
Well, if it is an anxiety disorder,

13:30.585 --> 13:32.552
it can likely be controlled
with medication.

13:32.554 --> 13:34.787
What about side effects?

13:34.789 --> 13:37.123
Magic requires dexterity,
it requires focus.

13:37.125 --> 13:39.025
I can't take anything
that's gonna impair that.

13:39.027 --> 13:41.060
Look, I'm not prescribing anything yet.

13:41.062 --> 13:42.862
Let me take some blood.

13:42.864 --> 13:44.097
See if that gets us anywhere.

13:44.099 --> 13:45.398
And, in the meantime...

13:45.400 --> 13:47.033
no escapes.

13:48.569 --> 13:50.336
I have a huge show tonight.

13:50.338 --> 13:52.372
If I don't barely escape from that crate

13:52.374 --> 13:54.474
right before J. Turner Wellerbing

13:54.476 --> 13:56.075
drives his Aston Martin into it,

13:56.077 --> 13:57.377
he's not gonna be happy.

13:59.046 --> 14:00.880
Okay, I'm not saying don't do any magic.

14:00.882 --> 14:02.715
Just stick to turning handkerchiefs

14:02.717 --> 14:03.883
into Hermes scarves

14:03.885 --> 14:05.818
and quarters into krugerrands.

14:05.820 --> 14:07.187
You said rich people love custom.

14:07.189 --> 14:08.488
Isn't that what you said?

14:08.490 --> 14:10.390
Look, I will walk your blood
into the lab myself

14:10.392 --> 14:12.125
and try to work my magic.

14:12.127 --> 14:13.693
But until I know for sure
what's going on with you,

14:13.695 --> 14:15.495
I'm sorry, but Mr. Wellerbing
is just gonna have to drive

14:15.497 --> 14:17.197
his Aston Martin into someone else.

14:26.640 --> 14:28.007
[Cell phone rings]

14:31.412 --> 14:32.612
[Softly]
Yes?

14:32.614 --> 14:34.013
Hey, I need our billing number

14:34.015 --> 14:35.582
for the lab at Hamptons Heritage.

14:35.584 --> 14:36.583
Again?

14:39.253 --> 14:42.755
[Whispering]
"O" 8a7bgp732.

14:42.757 --> 14:44.524
Why is that so hard for you to remember?

14:44.526 --> 14:46.192
Hang on, let me get a pen.

14:46.194 --> 14:47.460
And why are you talking like that?

14:47.462 --> 14:48.828
Are you stalking Matt Lauer?

14:50.798 --> 14:52.899
[Whispering]
No, I am not stalking him.

14:52.901 --> 14:55.435
I am... observing him from a safe distance

14:55.437 --> 14:58.404
until the moment is right
for me to, uh, strike.

14:58.406 --> 15:00.073
Evan, that's stalking.

15:00.075 --> 15:02.642
Just call me when when you find a pen.

15:02.644 --> 15:04.210
Wait, I got one! Hello? Evan?

15:04.212 --> 15:05.411
- Uhh!
- Hey there.

15:05.413 --> 15:06.879
- Hey.
- Problem?

15:06.881 --> 15:09.382
I need Evan to give me
our billing number for the lab.

15:09.384 --> 15:12.085
"O" 8a7bgp732.

15:12.087 --> 15:14.020
How does he... how do you...

15:14.022 --> 15:15.054
one more time.

15:15.056 --> 15:16.289
[Laughs]

15:16.291 --> 15:19.325
Come here.

15:19.327 --> 15:21.127
"O" 8a...

15:23.564 --> 15:25.098
there you go.

15:25.100 --> 15:26.132
Problem solved.

15:26.134 --> 15:27.333
Thank you.

15:27.335 --> 15:28.468
Now can you get Evan to quit

15:28.470 --> 15:30.103
his <i>Today</i> Show obsession?

15:30.105 --> 15:31.237
I'm sure it's just a phase.

15:31.239 --> 15:32.438
Yeah, you thought him saying,

15:32.440 --> 15:34.307
"Evan R. Lawson, CFO of Hankmed"

15:34.309 --> 15:35.475
was just a phase too.

15:35.477 --> 15:37.477
Wishful thinking, I guess.

15:37.479 --> 15:39.279
- You know what I wish?
- Hmm?

15:39.281 --> 15:40.847
I wish there was a fake <i>Today</i> Show

15:40.849 --> 15:42.282
I could hire to interview him.

15:42.284 --> 15:43.716
Then he'd stop.

15:43.718 --> 15:45.151
You know, I have a friend

15:45.153 --> 15:46.986
in the Suffolk College Media Department...

15:46.988 --> 15:49.489
she might be able
to arrange something like that.

15:49.491 --> 15:50.857
But wouldn't that be cruel?

15:50.859 --> 15:51.924
Yeah.

15:51.926 --> 15:53.559
Yeah, it would.

15:53.561 --> 15:57.030
- Let's call her.
- Okay.

15:57.032 --> 15:58.965
[Coughing]

15:58.967 --> 16:02.101
- Are you okay?
[Loudly] - I'm fine, Hank!

16:02.103 --> 16:03.870
[Loudly]
Uh, okay... Jill.

16:03.872 --> 16:05.338
Uh, maybe have a sip of the tea.

16:05.340 --> 16:07.073
- Yeah. Okay.
- Okay.

16:07.075 --> 16:08.074
- Thanks.
- See ya.

16:14.715 --> 16:16.349
Hey, you're the new girl, yeah?

16:16.351 --> 16:18.318
Um, the new P.A., yes. Divya...

16:18.320 --> 16:19.752
I've written discharge papers
for bed four,

16:19.754 --> 16:21.421
but give him a road test first, will you?

16:21.423 --> 16:23.556
Road test?

16:23.558 --> 16:25.058
Make sure he's sober.

16:25.060 --> 16:27.160
Got it. What's going on with him?

16:27.162 --> 16:28.161
Well, for starters,

16:28.163 --> 16:29.395
he's uninsured

16:29.397 --> 16:30.930
and smells like cheap scotch.

16:30.932 --> 16:32.332
He wanted a shot of meperidine,

16:32.334 --> 16:35.301
but I just gave him some antacid
for his gastritis.

16:35.303 --> 16:37.337
Drug seekers are like cats, you know?

16:37.339 --> 16:40.673
You can't feed 'em
or they keep comin' back.

16:43.143 --> 16:44.510
Mr. Lauer, you let me know

16:44.512 --> 16:45.578
if there's anything I can help you with.

16:45.580 --> 16:47.280
Thanks, Bernice. I will.

16:54.655 --> 16:56.422
May I help you?

16:56.424 --> 16:58.558
Um, no. No, actually.

16:58.560 --> 17:01.060
I was just admiring
this, uh, this beautiful horse.

17:01.062 --> 17:02.328
It's spectacular, isn't it?

17:02.330 --> 17:03.329
Mm-hmm.

17:03.331 --> 17:04.864
It was carved in the 19th century.

17:04.866 --> 17:06.432
It was taken from the carousel

17:06.434 --> 17:08.935
that appeared in the film <i>Mary Poppins.</i>

17:08.936 --> 17:10.670
- Really? <i>Mary Poppins</i> ?
- Mm-hmm.

17:10.672 --> 17:12.271
The bridle, I think, has been replaced,

17:12.272 --> 17:13.740
but the tail is original horsehair.

17:13.742 --> 17:15.241
Okay, excuse me.
Excuse me for one second.

17:15.242 --> 17:17.777
- Sorry.
- Ohh! [Shrieks]

17:17.779 --> 17:18.944
Ohh!

17:18.946 --> 17:21.180
Look what you've done to poor Wilbur.

17:21.182 --> 17:22.714
- Wilbur?
- Oh, my...

17:22.717 --> 17:24.584
- Sorry, Wilbur.
- Um...

17:24.586 --> 17:26.551
- Here, let me just...
- No, no, sir...

17:26.554 --> 17:27.854
no, I can sew... I can shove it back in.

17:36.231 --> 17:38.965
My head hurts. My stomach hurts.

17:38.967 --> 17:40.133
[Burps]

17:40.135 --> 17:42.201
I got gas shooting out both ends.

17:42.203 --> 17:43.536
Terrific.

17:43.538 --> 17:44.771
I hear that you have been drinking.

17:44.773 --> 17:46.272
Pff! A little.

17:46.274 --> 17:49.409
Hey, if you get away with it
on the job, right?

17:49.411 --> 17:51.310
You mind lifting up your shirt for me?

17:51.312 --> 17:53.980
You'll have to toss me some beads first.

17:53.982 --> 17:58.751
Kidding.

17:58.753 --> 18:00.686
Ahh.

18:09.830 --> 18:10.997
[Inhales sharply]

18:15.602 --> 18:17.069
What? What was that look for?

18:17.071 --> 18:18.337
[Sighs]
It means that your days

18:18.339 --> 18:20.406
of drinking on the job,
among other places,

18:20.408 --> 18:21.674
are over.

18:23.677 --> 18:25.678
The accumulation of fluid in your abdomen

18:25.680 --> 18:27.313
is called ascites.

18:27.315 --> 18:30.183
The paracentesis should
give you some relief.

18:33.454 --> 18:34.487
Whoa.

18:36.023 --> 18:38.224
Look at that.

18:38.226 --> 18:39.992

18:39.994 --> 18:42.195
and I turned whisky into beer.

18:42.197 --> 18:43.429
[Chuckles]

18:43.431 --> 18:48.034
Actually, you turned it
into peritoneal fluid.

18:48.036 --> 18:49.836
Your drinking has damaged your liver

18:49.838 --> 18:51.704
and you need to see a hepatologist.

18:51.706 --> 18:54.207
Still, it looks cool.

18:54.209 --> 18:55.508
Hmm.

18:58.812 --> 19:00.012
What are you doing?

19:00.014 --> 19:01.514
Paracentesis.

19:01.516 --> 19:02.715
I can see that.

19:02.717 --> 19:03.950
Where did you get the ultrasound?

19:03.952 --> 19:05.218
Oh, I grabbed it from down the hall.

19:05.220 --> 19:07.687
It reduces the risk of
intra-abdominal organ injury.

19:07.689 --> 19:09.288
I know what it does,
but you can't just go

19:09.290 --> 19:11.524
grabbing an ultrasound
because you feel like it.

19:11.526 --> 19:13.359
There's protocol.

19:13.361 --> 19:16.028
Does Dr. Van Dyke know you're doing this?

19:16.030 --> 19:17.296
Uh, no.

19:17.298 --> 19:19.031
Oh, impressive.

19:19.033 --> 19:22.034
You're going to get fired
after only two shifts.

19:29.874 --> 19:34.511
Andy?

19:34.513 --> 19:35.812
Andy...

19:35.814 --> 19:37.547
- Yeah.
- Aah!

19:37.549 --> 19:38.548
Look, I know you're a magician,

19:38.550 --> 19:39.549
but do you have to do that?

19:39.551 --> 19:40.984
- Do what?
- Just appear?

19:40.986 --> 19:42.953
I didn't just appear.
I came from the bathroom.

19:42.955 --> 19:44.488
Oh.

19:44.490 --> 19:45.722
Okay.

19:45.724 --> 19:46.890
Well, I have some news.

19:46.892 --> 19:48.692
Your symptoms aren't being caused

19:48.694 --> 19:49.860
by an anxiety disorder.

19:49.862 --> 19:51.828
They're from an elevated thyroid level.

19:51.830 --> 19:53.163
So why do I have that?

19:53.165 --> 19:56.500
If you don't mind...

19:56.502 --> 19:58.135
um... swallow for me.

19:58.137 --> 19:59.302
[Gulp]

19:59.304 --> 20:00.904
There it is.

20:00.906 --> 20:03.240
An adenoma on your thyroid gland.

20:03.242 --> 20:04.674
It's called a hot nodule.

20:04.676 --> 20:06.176
Hmm, terrific.

20:06.178 --> 20:08.011
The one part of me
that's hot's making me sick.

20:08.013 --> 20:09.412
I'm gonna give you some beta blockers.

20:09.414 --> 20:10.914
They need to build up in your system,

20:10.916 --> 20:12.215
but once they do,

20:12.217 --> 20:13.550
you ought to have some short-term relief.

20:13.552 --> 20:14.885
What about long term?

20:14.887 --> 20:17.053
Surgery to remove the adenoma.

20:17.055 --> 20:18.321
It's pretty minor.

20:18.323 --> 20:19.656
And after a few weeks rest,

20:19.658 --> 20:20.857
you'll be good as new.

20:20.859 --> 20:23.860
So I know what's going on with me now.

20:23.862 --> 20:25.595
Ta-da!

20:25.597 --> 20:26.763
- Don't do that.
- What?

20:26.765 --> 20:28.398
Never do "Ta-da".

20:28.400 --> 20:31.168
- Why not?
- It says your magic is weak.

20:31.170 --> 20:32.936
I... I... it speaks for the moment

20:32.938 --> 20:34.671
when the moment should speak for itself.

20:34.673 --> 20:35.705
Ohh.

20:41.012 --> 20:42.379
- Hey.
- Hey.

20:42.381 --> 20:43.814
I thought your shift was over.

20:43.816 --> 20:45.081
It is.

20:45.083 --> 20:47.050
I had some patients to follow up on.

20:47.052 --> 20:48.218
Yeah.

20:48.220 --> 20:49.920
The guy with the ascites you drained...

20:54.192 --> 20:55.792
Did the duty nurse come running in here

20:55.794 --> 20:57.360
like the sky was falling?

20:57.362 --> 20:58.895
No, but...

20:58.897 --> 21:00.096
Honestly, Jill, the way she went on

21:00.098 --> 21:02.232
about protocol.

21:02.234 --> 21:03.667
How I could be fired.

21:03.669 --> 21:05.502
You'd think that I was
somehow killing this man.

21:05.504 --> 21:07.604
Divya.

21:07.606 --> 21:10.640
She was right.

21:10.642 --> 21:12.943
Okay.

21:12.945 --> 21:15.879
Welcome to a hospital.

21:15.881 --> 21:18.548
You can't do things how
you'd want to when you want to.

21:18.550 --> 21:20.116
Hey, Van Dyke barely looked at the guy.

21:20.118 --> 21:21.651
He totally missed the ascites.

21:21.653 --> 21:22.919
I'm not arguing that the patient

21:22.921 --> 21:24.888
didn't need a procedure.

21:24.890 --> 21:26.656
But you should have told Van Dyke first.

21:26.658 --> 21:28.758
It wasn't brain surgery.

21:28.760 --> 21:29.993
It doesn't matter.

21:29.995 --> 21:32.262
Divya, I love having you here,

21:32.264 --> 21:34.297
and I was happy to help you
with this job.

21:34.299 --> 21:36.433
But now, I need you to help me

21:36.435 --> 21:38.134
by following the rules.

21:38.136 --> 21:42.105
Because, while it's nice that
they protect my doctors' egos,

21:42.107 --> 21:44.307
what's really nice...

21:44.309 --> 21:46.643
is they protect the patient's health.

21:50.481 --> 21:52.148
Ahh.

21:52.150 --> 21:53.483
Yeah.

21:53.485 --> 21:55.018
[Exhales]

21:55.020 --> 21:57.854
What the hell is that?

21:57.856 --> 21:59.089
This? What is it?

21:59.091 --> 22:00.590
It's an antique carousel horse.

22:00.592 --> 22:01.925
Hmm.

22:01.927 --> 22:03.293
Originally carved in the 19th century,

22:03.295 --> 22:06.263
it also appeared in the film
<i>Mary Poppins.</i>

22:10.868 --> 22:12.702
And you have it because...

22:12.704 --> 22:13.904
Uh, no reason.

22:13.906 --> 22:15.372
Just don't touch its tail.

22:15.374 --> 22:16.806
Okay.

22:19.677 --> 22:23.413
So, Ev, uh...

22:23.415 --> 22:25.282
you're not gonna believe this.

22:25.284 --> 22:27.517
The <i>Today</i> Show actually called.

22:27.519 --> 22:29.319
They want to interview us.

22:29.321 --> 22:30.587
What?

22:30.589 --> 22:31.688
What?

22:31.690 --> 22:34.124
Hold on.

22:34.126 --> 22:35.458
- What?!
- I know!

22:35.460 --> 22:37.394
Are you kidding me?

22:37.396 --> 22:38.662
Oh, my God!

22:38.664 --> 22:40.397
I told you that DVD was a good idea!

22:40.399 --> 22:41.698
I guess I can't argue.

22:41.700 --> 22:43.133
They'll be here on Friday at 9:30.

22:43.135 --> 22:44.868
[Laughing]
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

22:44.870 --> 22:46.002
Yes!

22:46.004 --> 22:48.271
Oh, my... ohh.

22:48.273 --> 22:52.609
[Cell phone chimes]

22:52.611 --> 22:54.477
[Over speakerphone]
Hey, Hank, it's Andy.

22:54.479 --> 22:56.279
Hey, I just want to say thanks.

22:56.281 --> 22:59.115
These pills already
have me feeling 100% better.

22:59.117 --> 23:01.184
Good, good.
[Car revving over speakerphone]

23:01.186 --> 23:03.053
Okay, I gotta go. Bye.

23:03.055 --> 23:06.289
Man... think I sweat out like ten pounds

23:06.291 --> 23:09.326
lugging that thing in here.

23:09.328 --> 23:11.161
Andy said he always takes a water pill

23:11.163 --> 23:12.562
before an escape.

23:12.564 --> 23:14.230
Water comes in pills?

23:14.232 --> 23:16.533
Dude, I'd swallow, like,
10,000 of those right now.

23:16.535 --> 23:17.867
No, no, water pills are diuretics.

23:17.869 --> 23:19.469
They make your body lose water.

23:19.471 --> 23:21.805
Then I would not swallow any of them.

23:21.807 --> 23:23.707
Evan, do you know where
the Wellerbings live?

23:23.709 --> 23:26.076
Yeah, it's the biggest house
on Georgica Pond.

23:26.078 --> 23:27.644
I've been trying to sign
those guys up with us

23:27.646 --> 23:29.612
since last summer... why?

23:29.614 --> 23:30.981
'Cause I need to get there now.

23:30.983 --> 23:33.083
There's more to Andy's condition
than I realized.

23:33.085 --> 23:34.684
He wasn't paralyzed by fear.

23:34.686 --> 23:36.987
He was paralyzed by paralysis.

23:36.989 --> 23:39.689
[Crowd cheering]

23:39.691 --> 23:41.191
Now, now...

23:41.193 --> 23:44.094
once I am securely locked
inside the crate,

23:44.096 --> 23:46.496
Mr. Wellerbing will crush me

23:46.498 --> 23:48.698
at 60 miles per hour

23:48.700 --> 23:51.468
with his Aston Martin DBS,

23:51.470 --> 23:54.671
one of the most expensive cars
in the world.

23:54.673 --> 23:56.072
Now, Mr. Wellerbing,

23:56.074 --> 23:57.340
you know that if this doesn't go well,

23:57.342 --> 23:59.376
your car could get pretty messed up.

23:59.378 --> 24:00.877
Are you sure you don't want to use

24:00.879 --> 24:02.545
one of those cheap
Lamborghinis that you have?

24:02.547 --> 24:03.747
[Chuckles]
No? All right.

24:03.749 --> 24:04.748
How long do I have?

24:04.750 --> 24:07.217
Zero to 60 in 4.7 seconds.

24:07.219 --> 24:09.252
Mr. Wellerbing,
please take your position.

24:09.254 --> 24:12.555
I need two volunteers. Two volunteers.

24:12.557 --> 24:14.958
Ah, lovely lady in the back,
please come forward.

24:14.960 --> 24:17.594
And you, miss,
would you please step forward?

24:17.596 --> 24:19.529
If you don't mind opening the crate,

24:19.531 --> 24:21.965
I would greatly appreciate it.

24:21.967 --> 24:23.733
Thank you very much.

24:23.735 --> 24:25.902

25:16.353 --> 25:18.721
You can't move, can you?

25:18.723 --> 25:19.789
[Weakly]
Ta-da.

25:23.243 --> 25:24.877
You took a water pill, didn't you?

25:24.879 --> 25:26.212
Yeah.

25:26.214 --> 25:27.613
What, now I'm gonna die?

25:27.615 --> 25:30.216
No. This is temporary.

25:30.218 --> 25:33.186
Your hyperthyroidism
combined with the dehydration

25:33.188 --> 25:36.222
from the water pill
dropped your potassium so low,

25:36.224 --> 25:40.727
you went into thyrotoxic
periodic paralysis.

25:40.729 --> 25:42.228
So all those times I was feeling weak,

25:42.230 --> 25:43.696
is this what was happening then too?

25:43.698 --> 25:45.765
If I were a betting man,
I'd put money on it.

25:45.767 --> 25:47.967
And didn't I tell you to stay
away from confinement tricks?

25:47.969 --> 25:49.936
[Sighs]

25:49.938 --> 25:52.438
Magic is my life, Hank.

25:52.440 --> 25:56.309
I can't go back to selling
corrective insoles.

25:56.311 --> 25:58.144
Damn it!

25:58.146 --> 26:00.346
All that planning, all that rehearsal.

26:00.348 --> 26:01.347
And I blew it.

26:01.349 --> 26:02.515
What? Are you kidding me?

26:02.517 --> 26:04.083
You did it half-paralyzed.

26:04.085 --> 26:05.918
I mean, that's...
that's even more amazing.

26:05.920 --> 26:07.120
No. No.

26:07.122 --> 26:08.087
It didn't go as planned.

26:08.089 --> 26:09.288
There was no big finish.

26:09.290 --> 26:10.623
Just a bunch of broken glasses

26:10.625 --> 26:11.858
and people that think I'm pathetic.

26:11.860 --> 26:13.359
Oh, my God, I swear to God.

26:13.361 --> 26:14.827
This is like high school again.

26:14.829 --> 26:17.230
A... actually, in that waiter's outfit,

26:17.232 --> 26:20.032
I don't think most people here
even know it's you.

26:20.034 --> 26:21.134
Thank you.

26:22.636 --> 26:24.871
You're honey and plastic wrap, right?

Actually, I go by Betty.

26:26.541 --> 26:28.040
[Chuckles]

I've worked a lot of the same
parties out here as you,

26:30.278 --> 26:33.079
and that was the coolest
illusion I've ever seen.

26:33.081 --> 26:35.948
And not just of yours. Of... of anyone's.

26:37.217 --> 26:39.152
Thanks, Betty.

26:39.154 --> 26:40.186
I'm Andy.

I'd shake your hand, but I'm
kind of paralyzed right now.

Are you sure this is gonna wear off?

26:47.729 --> 26:50.329
Positive.

26:51.365 --> 26:52.565
Oh, I'm so sorry.

26:52.567 --> 26:53.633
I did not know that you were busy.

26:53.635 --> 26:55.368
I'm not. Close the curtain.

27:01.375 --> 27:02.775
You asked to see me?

27:02.777 --> 27:04.010
How are your eyes?

27:04.012 --> 27:05.545
- Good.
- Not you, Danny.

27:05.547 --> 27:06.913
They're fine.

27:06.915 --> 27:08.281
Top of this patient's chart,

27:08.283 --> 27:11.317
what does it say
next to the word "physician"?

27:11.319 --> 27:13.386
It says "Van Dyke."

27:13.388 --> 27:14.987
Winner, winner, chicken dinner.

27:14.989 --> 27:16.756
Dr. Van Dyke, I wasn't trying
to flout your authority.

27:16.758 --> 27:18.191
- I was merely...
- Okay, this isn't a discussion.

27:18.193 --> 27:21.060
So I don't need explanations, apologies,

27:21.062 --> 27:22.528
or excuses.

27:22.530 --> 27:24.297
You thought I missed
the ascites, didn't you?

27:24.299 --> 27:25.932
- Yes.
- Well...

27:25.934 --> 27:27.500
his presentation didn't warrant

27:27.502 --> 27:30.069
immediate paracentesis.

27:30.071 --> 27:32.104
What he needed was
a trip to the free clinic.

27:32.106 --> 27:34.373
So... next time you get the urge

27:34.375 --> 27:37.109
to go sticking needles into my patients,

27:37.111 --> 27:38.778
consult me first.

27:38.780 --> 27:41.347
I will.

27:41.349 --> 27:44.417
Now... breaches of protocol aside,

27:44.419 --> 27:46.519
his peritoneal fluid
came back from the lab

27:46.521 --> 27:48.054
positive for SBP.

27:48.056 --> 27:50.289
Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis.

27:50.291 --> 27:51.924
He's been admitted.

27:51.926 --> 27:54.126
Turns out, you probably saved his life.

27:54.128 --> 27:56.128
Or, since my name's on his chart,

27:56.130 --> 27:57.530
I did.

27:57.532 --> 27:58.698
Danny, stop wiggling,

27:58.700 --> 28:00.433
unless you want a crooked eyebrow.

28:01.535 --> 28:04.003
So...

28:04.005 --> 28:06.873
in spite of the ass-backward
way you went about it,

28:06.875 --> 28:11.177
you made me look good,
and I'd like to say thank you.

28:11.179 --> 28:12.445
Well, you are welcome...

28:12.447 --> 28:13.913
I'd like to say thank you...

28:13.915 --> 28:16.482
by buying you dinner.

28:16.484 --> 28:17.717
So...

28:17.719 --> 28:21.020
I'll let you know where and when.

28:23.457 --> 28:24.824
You can go now.

28:24.826 --> 28:28.060
Not you, Danny.

28:30.964 --> 28:34.100
Almost done.

28:40.274 --> 28:41.474
[Crash]
Whoa!

28:41.476 --> 28:44.343
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- Oh, my...

28:44.345 --> 28:45.511
It's you.

28:45.513 --> 28:46.946
Yeah, it's me.

28:46.948 --> 28:48.948
Ben Affleck.

28:48.950 --> 28:50.349
Oh!

28:50.351 --> 28:52.585
Isn't that crazy how... how, sometimes,

28:52.587 --> 28:53.886
when you stop looking for something,

28:53.888 --> 28:55.588
it just pops up in front of you?

28:55.590 --> 28:56.789
I guess.

28:56.791 --> 28:57.757
Right now, I'm just looking

28:57.759 --> 28:59.358
for a little cowboy rub.

28:59.360 --> 29:01.060
You're looking for what?

29:01.062 --> 29:02.161
Yeah, that sounded weird.

29:02.163 --> 29:03.729
It's, um, it's a spice blend.

29:03.731 --> 29:06.732
I like it on my meat.

29:06.734 --> 29:08.534
That sounded weird too.

29:08.536 --> 29:10.369
It's, uh... look.

29:10.371 --> 29:12.171
Grilly Man Cowboy Rub.

29:12.173 --> 29:13.172
See? Not weird.

29:13.174 --> 29:14.740
Cool.

29:14.742 --> 29:16.309
So I'm... I'm really looking forward

29:16.311 --> 29:18.678
- to our interview on Friday.
- What?

29:18.680 --> 29:19.912
Um, our...

29:19.914 --> 29:21.480
oh, do you not recognize me?

29:21.482 --> 29:24.016
I'm Evan R. Lawson, the CFO
of Hankmed, from the DVD.

29:24.018 --> 29:27.086
My brother and I, we're talking
on the show on Friday, 9:30.

29:27.088 --> 29:28.854
He's the former E.R. doctor

29:28.856 --> 29:30.323
turned house call physician to the rich

29:30.325 --> 29:31.657
and not-so-rich.

29:31.659 --> 29:32.725
Wait a minute.

29:32.727 --> 29:34.260
Did you watch the DVD?

29:34.262 --> 29:35.661
Can I be honest with you?

29:35.663 --> 29:37.697
I don't have a clue
what you're talking about.

29:37.699 --> 29:39.599
We don't have
a doctor interview on Friday.

29:39.601 --> 29:40.967
This is baby animal week.

29:40.969 --> 29:44.537
Al got the polar bears. I got turtles.

29:44.539 --> 29:46.806
Ooh, turtles. That sucks, for both of us.

29:46.808 --> 29:48.874
Listen, Matt... can I call you Matt?

29:48.876 --> 29:51.110
- No.
- Mr. Lauer...

29:51.112 --> 29:52.445
you wanna get out of this turtle thing?

29:52.447 --> 29:53.813
I have a perfect replacement

29:53.815 --> 29:55.681
that not only fits
into your occasional series

29:55.683 --> 29:57.550
on the changing face
of health care in America,

29:57.552 --> 29:59.518
but also features home video

29:59.520 --> 30:01.854
of a brutal, multi-car accident

30:01.856 --> 30:05.191
with a daring medical rescue at the end.

30:05.193 --> 30:06.459
Evan, right?

30:06.461 --> 30:08.260
Yes.

30:08.262 --> 30:09.795
Evan, take a walk with me.

30:09.797 --> 30:12.331
I need a little sugar.

30:12.333 --> 30:15.301
Why does that keep happening?

30:25.345 --> 30:28.047
I understand you've
regained some memories

30:28.049 --> 30:29.782
from the night of the accident.

30:29.784 --> 30:30.816
I have.

30:30.818 --> 30:32.451
At the time,

30:32.453 --> 30:34.220
I recalled smelling cigarette smoke.

30:34.222 --> 30:36.355
So there was someone else there.

30:36.357 --> 30:38.557
The driver who fled, presumably?

30:38.559 --> 30:40.059
Mm, a second person.

30:40.061 --> 30:42.361
- You saw them?
- No.

30:42.363 --> 30:44.897
But I heard something that would
only really make sense

30:44.899 --> 30:46.899
if one person were talking to another.

30:46.901 --> 30:48.167
Which was?

30:48.169 --> 30:49.502
<i>Das ist die nicht.</i>

30:49.504 --> 30:52.772
<i>"Das ist</i> sie <i>nicht"?</i>

30:52.774 --> 30:54.240
"It's not her."

30:54.242 --> 30:56.575
So whoever that was was expecting to find

30:56.577 --> 30:58.044
someone else in your car.

30:58.046 --> 31:00.312
Hmm.

31:00.314 --> 31:01.347
So your theory, then,

31:01.349 --> 31:02.848
is that these persons

31:02.850 --> 31:04.383
deliberately created an accident

31:04.385 --> 31:05.785
to get to Marisa?

31:05.787 --> 31:07.687
Yes.

31:07.689 --> 31:09.422
The smoke you smelled,

31:09.424 --> 31:11.257
could it not have been a damaged engine?

31:11.259 --> 31:13.292
I don't think so, but...

31:13.294 --> 31:14.760
What does your therapist
say about all of this?

31:16.997 --> 31:18.764
You know I'm seeing a therapist?

31:18.766 --> 31:21.100
You're a member of the medical community.

31:21.102 --> 31:23.436
You sustained head trauma. I assumed.

31:25.238 --> 31:26.372
Right.

31:29.242 --> 31:31.277
I'm sorry, what did you ask?

31:31.279 --> 31:33.746
If your therapist feels
these are memories

31:33.748 --> 31:36.582
rather than fabrications?

31:36.584 --> 31:40.119
Are you saying that you think
that I'm imagining all of this?

31:40.121 --> 31:41.420
Well, I think...

31:41.422 --> 31:45.825
our minds seek to order
and explain our experiences...

31:45.827 --> 31:48.194
to give reason to events

31:48.196 --> 31:50.396
which otherwise would seem
random and meaningless.

31:50.398 --> 31:52.298
Well, if that's the case,

31:52.300 --> 31:54.867
then I have wasted your time
and the police's.

31:54.869 --> 31:56.902
The police?

31:56.904 --> 32:00.239
What did they think of your theory?

32:00.241 --> 32:02.942
They said they'd look into it.

32:04.611 --> 32:06.746
- Boris, I'm sorry if I've...
- Please, don't be.

32:06.748 --> 32:10.349
You were concerned
for someone else's safety.

32:10.351 --> 32:12.852
To allay any lingering fears you my have,

32:12.854 --> 32:15.621
I'll share your concern
with Galil, my security chief.

32:15.623 --> 32:18.824
Okay.

32:18.826 --> 32:20.259

it would be good to have one.

36:53.634 --> 36:54.666
- I can't do this.
- Yes, you...

36:54.668 --> 36:56.035
you agreed to do this.

36:56.037 --> 36:57.669
Yeah, because I never
thought it would happen.

36:57.671 --> 36:58.704
I... I don't know what to say.

36:58.706 --> 37:00.005
Just stick to the talking points.

37:00.007 --> 37:01.106
What talking points?

37:01.108 --> 37:02.908
- On the note cards you read.
- I...

37:02.910 --> 37:04.877
- That you didn't read.
- No.

37:04.879 --> 37:06.245
- Here, take mine.
- Okay.

37:06.247 --> 37:07.279
Read them really quick, right here.

37:07.281 --> 37:09.248
Just read some right now.

37:09.250 --> 37:10.315
Just memorize a couple of them.

37:10.317 --> 37:11.483
- Okay.
- Please, quick.

37:11.485 --> 37:13.485
We have become... we're... okay.

37:13.487 --> 37:16.121
It's ok... it's fine.
Just take a deep breath.

37:16.123 --> 37:17.956
- Hank, it's okay, all right?
- Okay.

37:17.958 --> 37:20.526
- Okay. Okay.
- It's all right.

37:20.528 --> 37:23.095
That, I have to say,
is, uh, pretty impressive stuff.

37:23.097 --> 37:24.663
So, Dr. Lawson, let me ask you,

37:24.665 --> 37:28.267
how would you say your life
has changed since then?

37:28.269 --> 37:29.535
It cha... well, um...

37:29.537 --> 37:30.636
[whispering]
Just read the cards.

37:30.638 --> 37:31.937
- How did that, uh...
- Just read.

37:31.939 --> 37:33.505
- These... I don't know.
- Just say something.

37:33.507 --> 37:35.674
Uh, there... there... uh...

37:35.676 --> 37:37.676
- Ah, umm. Aaah.
- You know, Matt,

37:37.678 --> 37:39.211
the business has definitely changed.

37:39.213 --> 37:40.879
We haven't changed that much at all.

37:40.881 --> 37:43.348
We're still the same patient-focused

37:43.350 --> 37:45.217
private practice that we've always been.

37:45.219 --> 37:46.885
- ...Private practice that we've always been.
- And... and we're just...

37:46.887 --> 37:48.687
- we're more popular.
- Yeah, we're more popular.

37:48.689 --> 37:50.355
- Yeah.
- More popular.

37:50.357 --> 37:52.891
In a day, an age when we go to the doctor

37:52.893 --> 37:56.128
and sometimes we feel
more like numbers than people,

37:56.130 --> 37:58.297
I have to say it's nice
to see that you guys

37:58.299 --> 38:00.532
are flipping that on its head.

38:00.534 --> 38:01.900
- We are. We are. We are.
- Yeah.

38:01.902 --> 38:04.903
And, you know what?
We're really flipping...

38:04.905 --> 38:06.105
good.

38:06.107 --> 38:07.906
Yeah, we're f... flipping good.

38:07.908 --> 38:09.641
That sounds like a new catchphrase.

38:09.643 --> 38:12.010
So, um, Hank and Evan,
we'll stop it there.

38:12.012 --> 38:13.212
Thank you for joining us.

38:13.214 --> 38:15.180
- Thank you.
- Thank you, Brian.

38:15.182 --> 38:17.649
[Sighs]
And we're clear.

38:19.319 --> 38:20.352
Who's Brian?

38:20.354 --> 38:21.620
That's Brian.

38:21.622 --> 38:22.921
Hank, no, that's Matt Lauer!

38:22.923 --> 38:24.389
[Whimpers]
That's Matt Lauer.

38:24.391 --> 38:25.491
Hank, what the...
what... what just happened?

38:25.493 --> 38:27.025
I don't know! I got... so I got...

38:27.027 --> 38:29.261
I got a little...
I got a little... nervous.

38:29.263 --> 38:31.330
You got a little ner... look at you!

38:31.332 --> 38:32.564
Dude, you're melting!

38:32.566 --> 38:33.866
Yeah, maybe that's because
you just sprang

38:33.868 --> 38:36.902
a nationally televised
live interview on me!

38:36.904 --> 38:38.837
Oh, that... that wasn't live.

38:38.839 --> 38:41.573
We were pre-taping to use
at some point in the future.

38:41.575 --> 38:42.774
- What?
- What? Wait, wait.

38:42.776 --> 38:43.642
So no one... no one saw that.

38:43.644 --> 38:44.977
Nope!

38:44.979 --> 38:46.145
And to be totally honest with you,

38:46.147 --> 38:48.113
I'm not super-sure that anyone ever will.

38:57.056 --> 38:58.390
[Softly]
You promise?

39:07.376 --> 39:13.081
Okay, so at the risk
of stealing your motto...

39:13.083 --> 39:15.016
I have a confession to make.

39:15.018 --> 39:16.551
[Crunching]

39:16.553 --> 39:18.920
I am terrified of public speaking.

39:18.922 --> 39:20.589
You don't say?

39:20.591 --> 39:23.058
Ever since my ninth grade
production of <i>The Wizard Of Oz.</i>

39:23.060 --> 39:24.626
Oh, when you played the scarecrow.

39:24.628 --> 39:25.694
And forgot all the words

39:25.696 --> 39:27.195
to <i>If I Only Had A Brain.</i>

39:27.197 --> 39:28.330
Yes, I remember that.

39:28.332 --> 39:29.564
I do. It was very ironic.

39:29.566 --> 39:30.732
It's hard to imagine something

39:30.734 --> 39:32.534
more embarrassing than that.

39:32.536 --> 39:34.269
[Crunching]
These pretzels are so good.

39:34.271 --> 39:35.270
I told you.

39:35.272 --> 39:37.539
So can we just...

39:37.541 --> 39:38.740
get something straight.

39:38.742 --> 39:41.243
Just wanna understand something.

39:41.245 --> 39:43.678
Cutting people open... that's easy.

39:43.680 --> 39:45.113
Right?

39:45.115 --> 39:49.484
Talking... scary to the point of

39:49.486 --> 39:51.119
sweating out half your body weight?

39:51.121 --> 39:52.988
What can I say?

39:52.990 --> 39:54.422
I'm more at home one on one

39:54.424 --> 39:55.757
than I am in front of an audience.

39:55.759 --> 39:57.158
You're being really honest about it.

39:57.160 --> 39:59.227
It's making it really hard
for me to gloat.

39:59.229 --> 40:02.130
Just please, don't ever
make me do that again.

40:02.132 --> 40:03.965
Believe me, had I known,

40:03.967 --> 40:06.401
it never would have happened.

40:06.403 --> 40:07.736
Really?

40:07.738 --> 40:09.738
You'd have passed up The <i>Today</i> Show?

40:09.740 --> 40:11.573
What? No, I wouldn't have passed it up.

40:11.575 --> 40:13.074
I just wouldn't have allowed you

40:13.076 --> 40:15.143
and your amazing waterfall
armpits near the camera.

40:15.145 --> 40:16.177
That's all.

40:16.179 --> 40:17.746
Look, I only agreed to do it

40:17.748 --> 40:20.282
because I never believed
you could make it happen.

40:20.284 --> 40:22.217
Yeah, you pretty much
don't believe anything

40:22.219 --> 40:25.854
I say I can do.

40:25.856 --> 40:29.090
It's funny.

40:31.994 --> 40:34.763
You're right.

40:34.765 --> 40:36.064
Hmm?

40:36.066 --> 40:38.767
You're right.

40:38.769 --> 40:41.836
You talk and I roll my eyes

40:41.838 --> 40:44.005
at your ideas, your dreams,

40:44.007 --> 40:45.707
and your schemes,

40:45.709 --> 40:47.542
just because they're yours
and I think you're crazy.

40:47.544 --> 40:49.077
Hmm.

40:49.079 --> 40:51.913
Only now I realize you're not just crazy,

40:51.915 --> 40:54.683
you're fearless.

40:54.685 --> 40:56.818
I just don't give up
when I know what I want.

40:56.820 --> 40:59.854
Not the first time, anyway.

40:59.856 --> 41:02.824
Which is why, in spite
of your objections, Henry,

41:02.826 --> 41:07.162
Hankmed must expand.

41:07.164 --> 41:09.931
Look, I know that's your plan.

41:09.933 --> 41:12.300
But what if it's not my plan?

41:12.302 --> 41:14.035
What if I'm comfortable
the way things are?

41:14.037 --> 41:15.403
Um, the way I remember it,

41:15.405 --> 41:16.905
you were comfortable back in Brooklyn

41:16.907 --> 41:18.106
in your boxer shorts,

41:18.108 --> 41:19.641
watching <i>Jerry Springer</i> reruns,

41:19.643 --> 41:21.743
drinking beer at 10:00 in the morning.

41:21.745 --> 41:24.980
You sure as heck didn't plan to
be a concierge doctor, either.

41:24.982 --> 41:27.682
Or to live here.

41:27.684 --> 41:29.718
Or to call it Hankmed, even.

41:29.720 --> 41:32.020
That was all me, Henry.

41:32.022 --> 41:35.256
That's true.

41:35.258 --> 41:36.992
Okay. Okay.

41:36.994 --> 41:38.226
This round goes to you.

41:38.228 --> 41:39.394
Hmm.

41:39.396 --> 41:41.529
But...

41:41.531 --> 41:42.964
our battle isn't over.

41:44.166 --> 41:45.667
Bring it.

41:45.669 --> 41:48.503
You're not turning this
into "McMedicine."

41:48.505 --> 41:49.537
Fine.

41:49.539 --> 41:50.839
How 'bout Medbucks?

41:50.841 --> 41:53.041
- Okay.
- Hank-Mart? Doc In The Box?

41:53.043 --> 41:56.277
Look, Henr... all I want to do
is add one doctor.

41:56.279 --> 41:58.747
One doctor to expand our service area.

41:58.749 --> 42:00.115
That's it.

42:00.117 --> 42:02.117
But...

42:02.119 --> 42:03.551
eventually...

42:03.553 --> 42:05.153
[Knock on door]

42:05.155 --> 42:07.188
Hi. We're here from The <i>Today</i> Show.

42:13.329 --> 42:14.696
Hi.
