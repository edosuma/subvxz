00:00.237 --> 00:01.987
Previously on How I Met Your Mother:

00:01.988 --> 00:03.740
She was completely amazing.

00:03.751 --> 00:06.606
She was amazing and funny and...

00:06.607 --> 00:08.632
You have feelings for Ted.

00:08.633 --> 00:09.715
Maybe.

00:09.716 --> 00:14.024
I've just been offered a fellowhip at a culinary institute in Germany.

00:14.025 --> 00:15.294
Do you want to try long distance?

00:15.295 --> 00:16.094
Yes.

00:16.096 --> 00:18.285
"This long-distance thing sucks, huh?

00:18.286 --> 00:20.130
And I really need to talk to you tonight."

00:20.130 --> 00:21.220
She's going to dump me!

00:21.220 --> 00:23.083
She's not going to break up with you, Ted.

00:23.083 --> 00:24.297
Hello?

00:24.552 --> 00:26.145
Do you want to come over?

00:39.458 --> 00:42.034
Kids, your grandma always used to say to me,

00:42.035 --> 00:44.722
"Nothing good happens after 2:00 a.m.,"

00:44.723 --> 00:45.881
and she was right.

00:45.882 --> 00:49.236
When 2:00 a.m. rolls around, just go home and go to sleep.

00:49.237 --> 00:50.707
Case in point:

00:53.561 --> 00:54.425
Hello.

00:54.426 --> 00:56.403
Hi, Ted, it's Robin.

00:56.404 --> 01:00.827
Um, listen, I know it's late, but do you want to come over?

01:02.248 --> 01:04.129
Let's back up a little bit.

01:15.728 --> 01:16.981
Sit.

01:17.133 --> 01:18.527
Good boys.

01:18.528 --> 01:22.892
Okay, remember, stay out of the liquor cabinet.

01:22.893 --> 01:24.188
I'll see you tonight.

01:25.376 --> 01:28.778
And so the life of a television reporter is very rewarding,

01:28.779 --> 01:32.310
and I stronly urge you to consider it as a career.

01:32.637 --> 01:33.825
Thank you.

01:36.331 --> 01:37.149
Yeah?

01:37.150 --> 01:39.340
Do you have a fiancé?

01:40.012 --> 01:41.475
Marshall was here yesterday.

01:41.476 --> 01:43.213
They just learned the word "fiancé."

01:43.214 --> 01:45.634
Oh, no, I don't have a fiancé.

01:45.635 --> 01:47.045
Then who do you live with?

01:47.046 --> 01:50.289
Well, actually, I've got five dogs.

01:50.290 --> 01:52.175
Don't you get lonely?

01:52.176 --> 01:54.759
No, I've got five dogs.

01:54.760 --> 01:58.152
My grandma has five cats and she gets lonely.

01:58.153 --> 02:01.842
Well, yeah, that's cats. I'm not some pathetic cat lady.

02:01.843 --> 02:03.911
Not that your grandmother is...

02:04.340 --> 02:06.427
Does anyone else have a...? Yes?

02:06.428 --> 02:09.136
- Are you a lesbian?
- No. Are you?

02:09.137 --> 02:11.328
Just because a woman lives alone doesn't mean she's a les...

02:11.329 --> 02:15.194
Okay, let's have a big hand for Robin the reporter.

02:15.497 --> 02:17.765
All right, our next guest is another friend...

02:17.766 --> 02:21.052
So, Robin, you ever report on train wrecks? 'Cause I just saw one.

02:21.053 --> 02:22.793
What up? Tiny five.

02:24.547 --> 02:26.991
Ha-ha. Laugh now, those kids are monsters.

02:26.992 --> 02:28.590
They're going to eat you alive.

02:28.591 --> 02:31.080
He has a job doing...

02:31.212 --> 02:32.497
What do you do?

02:32.526 --> 02:33.713
Please.

02:34.250 --> 02:35.927
Kids, let's rap.

02:35.976 --> 02:39.209
You guys don't give half a brown Crayola what I do for a living, do you?

02:39.210 --> 02:40.844
- No.
- No, no.

02:40.845 --> 02:42.517
I know what you want.

02:43.199 --> 02:44.468
Magic.

02:46.643 --> 02:47.666
Hello.

02:47.667 --> 02:48.883
Why hasn't she called yet?

02:48.884 --> 02:50.542
Okay, you're making yourself crazy.

02:50.543 --> 02:52.914
It's Saturday night. Go out and do something.

02:52.915 --> 02:56.966
What's the point of going out? I got a girlfriend... for now.

02:56.980 --> 02:58.486
Besides, if I go out, who's going to watch the news?

02:58.487 --> 03:00.018
I'm, like, half your viewership.

03:00.019 --> 03:02.378
I'm flattered you think we have two viewers.

03:04.734 --> 03:06.366
And we're clear.

03:06.367 --> 03:08.356
So, Scherbotsky, got a boyfriend?

03:08.357 --> 03:11.408
No, and why does this keep coming up today?

03:11.409 --> 03:13.301
Oh, I just thought that guy you were on the phone with...

03:13.302 --> 03:16.151
What? Oh, no, that was Ted. He's just a friend.

03:16.152 --> 03:18.834
I mean, there was this moment where we almost dated,

03:18.835 --> 03:21.327
but we want completely different things.

03:21.328 --> 03:23.383
Anyway, now he has this girlfriend in Germany

03:23.384 --> 03:26.728
and he thinks she's calling to dump him tonight, but I don't think she is.

03:26.729 --> 03:29.251
And besides, we want completely different things.

03:29.536 --> 03:31.212
We should have sex.

03:31.472 --> 03:33.357
- What?
- Why not?

03:33.358 --> 03:36.993
We're both available, we're both attractive, we're both good at it.

03:36.994 --> 03:38.599
At least, I'm good at it.

03:38.600 --> 03:41.919
And even if you're not, don't worry, I'll have a good time either way.

03:42.154 --> 03:47.163
Well, moving past the horrifying image of your hair helmet clanging against the headboard,

03:47.164 --> 03:49.947
don't get involved with people I work with.

03:50.040 --> 03:52.659
Get involved? Who said get involved?

03:52.660 --> 03:55.407
I'm just saying we should have sex, it could be fun.

03:55.691 --> 03:57.534
Having sex is fun.

03:58.037 --> 03:59.677
Home number. Call me anytime.

03:59.678 --> 04:02.367
A lot of local teens in action tonight...

04:05.124 --> 04:06.522
Hey, guys.

04:08.316 --> 04:09.763
Miss me?

04:13.159 --> 04:14.709
I missed you, too.

05:02.884 --> 05:04.952
Hi, Ted, it's Robin.

05:04.953 --> 05:09.294
Um, listen, I know it's late, but do you want to come over?

05:17.958 --> 05:18.937
Ted?

05:19.011 --> 05:21.287
Uh, yeah... Uh, hi, I'm here.

05:21.851 --> 05:23.486
Do you want to come over?

05:23.665 --> 05:25.324
Why? What's up?

05:26.292 --> 05:30.776
Well, um, I just finally set up my new juicer

05:30.777 --> 05:33.167
and I was going to make some juice, and I was, like,

05:33.168 --> 05:35.666
"You know who likes juice? Ted."

05:37.608 --> 05:38.724
I love juice.

05:38.725 --> 05:42.727
Great. So you want to come over and make juice?

05:42.997 --> 05:45.894
When it's after 2:00 a.m., just go to sleep

05:45.895 --> 05:50.245
because the decisions you make after 2:00 a.m. are the wrong decisions.

05:50.246 --> 05:54.297
Okay, sure. I'll come over. We'll... juice.

05:54.298 --> 05:55.731
Yes, we'll juice.

05:55.732 --> 05:56.948
O kay.

05:56.949 --> 05:58.979
Okay... bye.

05:59.559 --> 06:00.864
Bye.

06:06.620 --> 06:09.004
This is fine. This is totally fine.

06:09.119 --> 06:10.441
What's fine?

06:10.442 --> 06:13.705
Oh, I'm, uh, going over to this girl's house to make some juice.

06:14.345 --> 06:15.566
Nice.

06:15.567 --> 06:18.508
No, it's not like that. We're juicing as friends.

06:19.363 --> 06:22.957
See, I have this girlfriend, I would never cheat on her.

06:22.958 --> 06:24.668
She lives in Germany.

06:24.669 --> 06:28.994
See, she was supposed to call me four hours ago to have a serious talk.

06:28.995 --> 06:30.385
I still haven't heard from her.

06:30.386 --> 06:31.515
I don't know.

06:31.910 --> 06:34.113
Sorry to bug you with my problems.

06:34.155 --> 06:36.993
Guess cab drivers are the new bartenders, huh?

06:38.004 --> 06:40.063
You ain't kidding, kid.

06:41.585 --> 06:42.648
Want a nip?

06:42.649 --> 06:44.691
You can just let me out right up here.

06:45.747 --> 06:46.948
Where you going to, buddy?

06:46.949 --> 06:48.747
Park Slope, Eighth and Eighth.

06:50.818 --> 06:53.413
Okay, here's where I left off with the last guy.

06:53.414 --> 06:56.856
See, I have a girlfriend, but I'm going over to this other girl's house...

06:56.857 --> 06:58.921
And you're wondering if I'd be upset.

06:59.157 --> 07:01.755
Hi, Ted. Remember me, your girlfriend?

07:01.756 --> 07:03.990
Okay, relax, Robin's just a friend.

07:03.991 --> 07:06.471
Right. You're going to go make some juice.

07:06.472 --> 07:08.820
Yes, yes! Juice is perfectly harmless.

07:08.821 --> 07:10.747
In fact, it's healthy.

07:10.748 --> 07:13.742
Oh, yeah? Then why are you wondering what she looks like naked?

07:13.743 --> 07:15.713
I am not won...

07:15.714 --> 07:18.298
Okay, even if I am wondering that, it's only 'cause you put it in my head.

07:18.299 --> 07:20.881
Ah, but I'm just a manifestation of your subconscious,

07:20.882 --> 07:23.164
so actually, you put it in your own head.

07:23.165 --> 07:24.280
Damn it!

07:24.281 --> 07:25.611
Nothing's going to happen.

07:25.612 --> 07:26.470
Right.

07:26.470 --> 07:29.422
Okay, okay. You want a second opinion? Fine.

07:34.540 --> 07:36.033
Hey, did she call?

07:36.033 --> 07:37.794
No. I need a ruling.

07:37.794 --> 07:41.964
Um, I'm... Yeah, this is stupid. It's not even a big deal, but

07:41.965 --> 07:44.785
I'm on my way over to Robin's right now.

07:44.786 --> 07:48.286
She got a new juicer. Whatever. We're going to test it out.

07:48.487 --> 07:49.976
Let me call you back.

07:55.165 --> 07:58.050
Honey, there's a situation developing.

07:58.051 --> 08:00.259
Do you remember the huge secret that you told me

08:00.260 --> 08:02.351
that you weren't supposed to but you did?

08:02.352 --> 08:04.566
The thing... about Robin?

08:04.567 --> 08:06.222
Oh, you mean how Robin's in love with Ted?

08:06.223 --> 08:07.101
- What?
- What?

08:07.102 --> 08:09.252
Yeah, she told me already. Go on.

08:09.405 --> 08:11.620
Wait. So I'm the only one that she didn't tell?

08:11.621 --> 08:13.408
She told you and not me?

08:13.409 --> 08:16.199
Well, I guess I'm just better friends with her than you are.

08:16.200 --> 08:19.171
Well, I'm better friends with Ted than you are.

08:19.172 --> 08:21.367
- That is a lie!
- It is not a lie.

08:21.368 --> 08:24.223
Okay, that's it! You and me! I'm not afraid of you!

08:24.224 --> 08:26.792
I'll show you things you never seen before!

08:26.793 --> 08:28.488
I used to box in the Army!

08:30.989 --> 08:32.941
Come on, pick up.

08:33.244 --> 08:36.503
Damn it, Victoria, where are you? Pick up, pick up!

08:36.504 --> 08:37.467
Cupcake?

08:37.467 --> 08:38.611
No, thanks.

08:38.613 --> 08:40.393
Where are you? Why haven't you called?

08:40.394 --> 08:43.207
Oh, I'm out hooking up...

08:43.207 --> 08:44.938
with three other guys.

08:45.566 --> 08:49.946
Or maybe I'm a devoted girlfriend and I'm calling you right now.

08:49.947 --> 08:52.295
Yeah. Why do I doubt that?

08:53.960 --> 08:54.768
Hello.

08:54.769 --> 08:59.319
Ted, I just saw the news and a truck carrying sulphuric acid

08:59.320 --> 09:01.986
overturned right in front of Robin's house.

09:01.987 --> 09:03.507
And it's melting through the sidewalk.

09:03.508 --> 09:05.883
You can see straight down into hell. It's bad.

09:05.884 --> 09:07.148
You should go home, dude.

09:07.149 --> 09:10.383
Marshall, it's fine. Nothing's going to happen.

09:10.384 --> 09:12.892
Ted, what does your mom always say?

09:12.893 --> 09:14.057
Nothing good ever...

09:14.058 --> 09:18.036
Nothing good ever happens after 2:00 a.m. Go home! It's too late for juice.

09:18.037 --> 09:19.965
Dude, Robin and I are just friends.

09:19.966 --> 09:21.898
She doesn't even like me that way.

09:21.899 --> 09:25.291
Yes, she does! She likes you. She told me.

09:25.489 --> 09:26.200
What?

09:26.201 --> 09:28.907
It's a big secret, so don't tell her I told you,

09:28.908 --> 09:32.842
but she's very vulnerable right now and you have a girlfriend.

09:32.843 --> 09:34.754
Go home, Ted.

09:34.862 --> 09:36.229
She-she likes me?

09:36.230 --> 09:40.781
Yes. So you see why it would be a very bad idea for you to go up there.

09:40.782 --> 09:42.667
Go home, Ted.

09:43.200 --> 09:44.800
She likes me?

09:45.241 --> 09:47.179
Go home, Ted.

09:47.386 --> 09:52.585
Uh, you're right. I'll, uh, I'll see you at home.

09:53.599 --> 09:55.702
Good. He's going home.

09:55.703 --> 09:57.405
He is so not going home.

09:57.406 --> 09:59.591
I cannot believe you just told him that.

09:59.592 --> 10:00.560
What do you mean?

10:00.561 --> 10:01.898
Lily, here's what you just said:

10:01.899 --> 10:04.070
"Ted, whatever you do, don't go up there.

10:04.071 --> 10:06.776
There's a beautiful girl who wants to have sex with you."

10:06.777 --> 10:10.121
"And then she's gonna make you some delicious juice."

10:10.492 --> 10:14.498
No, he's not going up there. He has more sense than that.

10:14.577 --> 10:17.009
I did have more sense than that.

10:17.428 --> 10:18.188
Keep the change.

10:18.189 --> 10:19.161
- Thanks.
- Thanks.

10:19.162 --> 10:22.211
But after 2:00 a.m, my good sense was sound asleep.

10:34.425 --> 10:36.588
So you're doing this? You're going up there?

10:36.589 --> 10:37.953
You want to get out of the way?

10:37.954 --> 10:39.762
I'm not in the way.

10:40.276 --> 10:43.149
You know, if you had just called me, I...

10:49.273 --> 10:50.294
- Hi.
- Hi.

10:50.995 --> 10:53.870
Um, I got some vegetables. I got carrots, I got beets.

10:53.871 --> 10:55.447
Or we could just drink wine.

10:55.448 --> 10:56.939
Wine... not?

10:56.940 --> 10:58.521
Well, that's the stupidest thing I've ever said.

10:59.792 --> 11:00.918
Thanks.

11:01.359 --> 11:02.854
Make it a big glass.

11:02.855 --> 11:04.163
Sure.

11:04.909 --> 11:06.608
So, how's it hanging?

11:08.371 --> 11:13.315
Have you ever had one of those days where nothing at all that monumental happens

11:13.316 --> 11:17.571
but by the end of it you have no idea who you are anymore

11:17.572 --> 11:19.761
or what the hell you're doing with your life?

11:19.972 --> 11:21.757
Do you ever have one of those days?

11:21.758 --> 11:23.574
Uh, about once a week.

11:24.042 --> 11:26.792
I don't know, it was just a, a rough day

11:26.793 --> 11:30.632
and the only person I wanted to see at the end of it was you.

11:33.142 --> 11:37.051
So... um... how was the big phone call with your girlfriend?

11:37.251 --> 11:40.853
When the clock strikes 2:00, just go to sleep.

11:41.089 --> 11:42.657
We broke up.

11:43.302 --> 11:44.366
What?

11:44.367 --> 11:46.555
Yeah. Yeah, she finally called.

11:46.556 --> 11:49.113
We talked for a while-- how hard long distance is--

11:49.114 --> 11:52.263
and then... she dumped me.

11:52.632 --> 11:58.325
Oh, Ted, I'm so sorry. That's just terrible. I feel awful.

11:58.997 --> 12:00.504
You're smiling.

12:00.505 --> 12:02.867
Am I? No I'm not.

12:03.308 --> 12:04.750
I'm a news anchor.

12:04.751 --> 12:06.471
Smiling's a part of the job.

12:06.472 --> 12:09.407
Thousands died in a tragic avalanche today.

12:09.408 --> 12:10.860
See?

12:12.521 --> 12:14.377
You're smiling, too.

12:16.262 --> 12:17.980
Yeah.

12:18.173 --> 12:21.065
I have no idea what that's all about.

12:23.507 --> 12:27.936
# There's got to be a morning after... #

12:27.937 --> 12:30.250
How much does Korean Elvis rock?

12:30.251 --> 12:31.448
I'll answer that.

12:31.449 --> 12:33.095
Infinity.

12:33.096 --> 12:36.259
He rocks... infinity.

12:36.345 --> 12:37.926
Okay, it's time for bed.

12:37.927 --> 12:40.258
What? No. It's 2:30.

12:40.259 --> 12:43.053
Nothing good ever happens after 2:00 a.m.

12:43.054 --> 12:45.827
You know, I have found, in my travels...

12:45.828 --> 12:50.131
that all the best things in life happen after 2:00 a.m.

12:50.132 --> 12:52.615
When I look back at the best stories of my life--

12:52.616 --> 12:56.723
the Liberty Bell incident, the little scrape I got in at the Russian Embassy,

12:56.724 --> 12:59.047
- the almost four-way.
- You never had a four-way.

12:59.048 --> 13:01.098
I said "almost."

13:01.168 --> 13:03.821
All those things happened after 2:00 a.m.

13:03.822 --> 13:10.257
because after 2:00 a.m. is when things get-- audience, say it with me-- legendary.

13:10.258 --> 13:11.669
We're going home.

13:11.670 --> 13:14.664
What's that? Interesting theory, Barney, but I'll need some proof?

13:14.665 --> 13:15.918
Okay.

13:18.427 --> 13:19.752
Korean Elvis.

13:19.753 --> 13:23.230
How would you like to have a drink with me and my friends?

13:23.361 --> 13:25.076
Rock 'n' roll.

13:25.954 --> 13:28.275
And it begins.

13:29.874 --> 13:33.538
So, um... Hey. I got a new phone.

13:33.539 --> 13:34.974
Same as yours. Look.

13:34.975 --> 13:36.964
Oh, yeah. Do you like it?

13:37.205 --> 13:39.510
Yeah. Yeah.

13:39.511 --> 13:41.782
This is some solid small talk.

13:42.115 --> 13:45.049
I had that other phone, and it was good,

13:45.050 --> 13:50.147
but I think the whole time a little part of me wanted this phone instead.

13:50.148 --> 13:52.123
This phone... um...

13:52.770 --> 13:54.645
feels right.

13:55.662 --> 13:57.620
Wow. Weird.

13:57.621 --> 14:01.038
Yeah. Uh, I should probably take this.

14:01.039 --> 14:02.888
I'll be here.

14:08.621 --> 14:09.487
Hello?

14:09.488 --> 14:11.702
Ted, this is your main man, K.E.

14:11.703 --> 14:15.202
I want you to shake your tail feathers down here ASAP, you dig?

14:15.203 --> 14:16.680
Sorry about that.

14:16.681 --> 14:18.271
Was that Korean Elvis?

14:18.272 --> 14:20.468
I'll explain later. Hey, we're headed down to MacLaren's.

14:20.469 --> 14:23.201
Um... Actually...

14:23.303 --> 14:25.760
I'm at Robin's.

14:25.844 --> 14:29.167
Yeah, and, um... I might have done something bad.

14:29.168 --> 14:32.991
I just lied and told her I broke up with Victoria.

14:32.992 --> 14:36.517
Ted, I don't want to swear in front of Korean Elvis,

14:36.518 --> 14:39.419
but what the bleep are you doing, dude?

14:39.420 --> 14:41.608
What do you expect from me? It's Robin.

14:41.609 --> 14:44.682
Victoria's great, but, it's Robin.

14:44.683 --> 14:47.470
I've made up my mind. I'm going to end it with Victoria.

14:47.471 --> 14:48.328
Gonna?

14:48.329 --> 14:49.983
Yes. First thing tomorrow.

14:49.984 --> 14:57.166
Okay, but, but, as of right now at-at... 2:45 a.m. you still have a girlfriend.

14:57.167 --> 14:59.779
Ted, I love you. I love Robin.

14:59.780 --> 15:05.425
But if you do this right now, your entire future with her will be built on a crime.

15:05.426 --> 15:09.250
Just go home, Ted. Don't do this the wrong way.

15:09.251 --> 15:10.990
I hate how you're always right.

15:10.991 --> 15:13.699
It's my best and most annoying trait.

15:14.245 --> 15:15.426
Okay.

15:16.427 --> 15:18.420
I'm coming home. I'll see you soon.

15:23.138 --> 15:24.541
- Hey.
- Hey.

15:31.642 --> 15:35.074
I should probably get going. It's pretty late.

15:36.601 --> 15:38.886
- I'm sorry. I...
- Oh. Oh, no. I understand.

15:38.887 --> 15:40.416
It's fine. Yeah.

15:43.240 --> 15:44.765
Can I call you tomorrow?

15:44.766 --> 15:46.877
Totally. Totally. Call me tomorrow.

15:46.878 --> 15:48.288
Okay. Good night, Robin.

15:48.289 --> 15:49.719
Good night, Ted.

16:21.485 --> 16:24.634
Oh, my God. We're making out.

16:24.635 --> 16:25.820
- Right.
- This is crazy.

16:25.821 --> 16:27.444
Right? Right?

16:29.840 --> 16:31.351
Should we go to my room?

16:31.352 --> 16:33.574
I mean, there's five dogs in there, but...

16:33.644 --> 16:34.639
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

16:34.640 --> 16:35.543
Yeah.

16:38.462 --> 16:44.201
I just, um... I have to run to the bathroom real quick.

16:45.256 --> 16:46.607
Okay.

16:59.780 --> 17:01.424
Stop doing that.

17:01.425 --> 17:03.038
Whatcha doin'?

17:03.504 --> 17:04.874
I'm calling you.

17:04.875 --> 17:07.111
We're breaking up. I'm doing this right now,

17:07.112 --> 17:09.250
I'm coming out of this bathroom a single man.

17:09.251 --> 17:10.586
Okay.

17:10.598 --> 17:13.958
Say, Ted... how long do you think that conversation's going to be?

17:13.959 --> 17:15.675
Length of an average pee?

17:15.676 --> 17:18.708
No. We're gonna be on the phone for at least 20 minutes.

17:18.709 --> 17:21.640
Robin's out there. She's gonna think you're in here taking a massive...

17:21.641 --> 17:23.036
What do you want from me?

17:23.037 --> 17:25.547
People break up. It happens.

17:25.968 --> 17:27.535
Not like this.

17:27.536 --> 17:30.959
Not from the bathroom of the girl that you're about to sleep with.

17:32.057 --> 17:34.440
It's not ideal.

17:35.023 --> 17:36.763
Meanwhile, back at the bar,

17:36.764 --> 17:40.585
Barney was still trying to prove that good things can happen after 2:00 a.m.

17:40.586 --> 17:42.362
Come on, Lily.

17:42.363 --> 17:46.987
How many women can say they've been personally serenaded by Korean Elvis?

17:49.337 --> 17:51.310
I think he just spat on me.

17:51.311 --> 17:54.162
Barney, you tried, I think that's great, but we're going.

17:54.163 --> 17:56.016
- No! No, come on.
- Yes!

17:56.017 --> 17:59.123
Dude, we haen't hit legendary yet. We're only at the "le".

17:59.124 --> 18:02.199
We still got the "gen." The "da." The "ry."

18:02.200 --> 18:07.335
Okay, if we're at the "le," then I say we follow it up with a "t's go home."

18:07.336 --> 18:11.650
Oh, wow, you just got burned, phonics style.

18:11.651 --> 18:15.322
No, no, no, no, no. Baby, baby, baby, don't go.

18:15.323 --> 18:16.734
Just one dance, huh?

18:16.735 --> 18:18.161
Okay, seriously.

18:18.162 --> 18:21.282
Hey, I know what you like.

18:27.867 --> 18:31.511
And so, Barney was right-- the night was legendary.

18:31.512 --> 18:35.595
It would come to be known as The Time Lily Kicked Korean Elvis in the Nards.

18:35.596 --> 18:40.242
Hey, you guys remember the time that Lily kicked Korean Elvis in the Nards?

18:41.976 --> 18:43.158
You're right.

18:43.159 --> 18:45.432
I owe you a real breakup call.

18:45.433 --> 18:46.948
I'll call you tomorrow.

18:46.949 --> 18:48.332
Good.

18:48.333 --> 18:49.945
So you're gonna go home?

18:50.611 --> 18:52.589
Why should I have to go home?

18:52.718 --> 18:56.358
You know, there's every chance Robin's the woman I'm going to marry.

18:56.359 --> 18:56.993
Ted.

18:56.994 --> 18:58.353
It could happen.

18:58.354 --> 19:02.724
And so really, what's it gonna matter in 50 years if I jump the gun by one night?

19:02.725 --> 19:06.353
Look, I-I know this is a moral gray area, but...

19:06.706 --> 19:08.417
It's Robin.

19:08.878 --> 19:09.997
And I'm exhausted.

19:09.998 --> 19:12.641
I am. I'm exhausted from pretending I'm not in love with her.

19:12.642 --> 19:14.171
I think that makes this okay.

19:14.172 --> 19:17.067
Oh, please. You just want to get laid.

19:17.102 --> 19:19.453
Yes, I do. You got me.

19:19.454 --> 19:22.137
That is exactly what I want right now. And so what?

19:22.138 --> 19:23.822
I want this. She wants this.

19:23.823 --> 19:27.070
It's happening, and if you have a problem with it, don't be in Germany.

19:28.011 --> 19:30.201
It's been nice pretending to talk to you.

19:30.202 --> 19:32.824
Thanks for not calling me and good night.

19:33.924 --> 19:35.914
That's not your phone.

19:36.944 --> 19:38.715
This isn't my phone.

19:45.037 --> 19:47.784
Okay. Bye.

19:49.661 --> 19:52.272
I thought it was mine, so I answered it.

19:52.986 --> 19:53.875
Was it...?

19:53.876 --> 19:55.682
It was your girlfriend.

19:56.418 --> 19:58.400
You might want to call her back.

20:20.336 --> 20:23.988
I called Victoria from the cab and we broke up.

20:24.558 --> 20:25.961
Yes...

20:26.128 --> 20:28.273
And there you have it, kids.

20:28.274 --> 20:31.252
The stupidest thing I've ever done.

20:31.521 --> 20:35.324
In one night, I managed to hurt two people I cared about.

20:35.325 --> 20:38.789
And none of it would've happened if I just listened to my mom.

20:49.405 --> 20:53.116
So I guess if there's a lesson to be learned here, it's this:

20:53.274 --> 20:57.642
when it's 2:00 a.m., just go to sleep.
