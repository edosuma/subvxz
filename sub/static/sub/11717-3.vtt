00:20.893 --> 00:22.536
Aloha, football fans,

00:22.537 --> 00:24.033
and welcome the grudge match;

00:24.034 --> 00:26.902
the inter-island rivalry
everyone's been waiting for:

00:26.965 --> 00:30.852
The Kapui Kings versus
the P-Boy's School. Yeah.

00:32.491 --> 00:35.001
Oh! How'd you miss that
facemask call, ref?!

00:35.002 --> 00:38.528
He only tried to gouge the
kid's eyes out! You suck!

00:38.529 --> 00:39.435
I'm glad she's on our team.

00:39.436 --> 00:41.078
No, she's just getting warmed up.

00:44.366 --> 00:46.914
Sorry we're late. Hey, brah.

00:46.915 --> 00:48.090
Nice hands, brah.

00:48.630 --> 00:51.356
Hey, Gracie. I'm Steve.

00:51.357 --> 00:52.668
It's great to meet you finally.

00:52.669 --> 00:54.457
Your dad, he talks
about you all the time.

00:54.458 --> 00:56.139
Talks about you a lot, too.

00:57.526 --> 00:59.587
Really? Does he?

00:59.588 --> 01:02.237
We, uh, we commiserate.
It's a father-daughter thing.

01:04.202 --> 01:04.923
Hi, I'm Kono.

01:04.924 --> 01:05.908
Hello.

01:06.164 --> 01:07.526
And I'm Uncle Chin.

01:07.527 --> 01:10.932
Are you a football player?
I used to be. I used to play

01:10.933 --> 01:12.337
quarterback for that red team.

01:12.338 --> 01:15.225
He was a legend, too, till,
uh, till I came along

01:15.226 --> 01:16.713
and shattered all his records.

01:20.338 --> 01:21.877
That's a really
pretty tennis outfit.

01:21.878 --> 01:24.501
Yeah, I had to pick her up
today at a country club.

01:26.063 --> 01:27.673
Step-Stan decided that she should

01:27.674 --> 01:29.043
start taking tennis lessons.

01:29.044 --> 01:30.218
What's wrong with tennis, Danny?

01:30.219 --> 01:31.428
I'll tell you what's
wrong with tennis.

01:31.429 --> 01:32.328
It can be played on a table,

01:32.329 --> 01:33.692
which makes it an activity,
not a sport.

01:33.693 --> 01:36.743
You throw the ball,
I catch the ball, that is a sport.

01:37.068 --> 01:38.306
It's my duty as a father

01:38.307 --> 01:39.604
to teach my daughter
the difference.

01:39.605 --> 01:41.293
Dad, I can still hear you.

01:41.693 --> 01:43.955
Well, you're not supposed
to be listening to me, huh?

01:43.956 --> 01:45.273
You're supposed to
be paying attention,

01:45.274 --> 01:47.175
'cause it's football.
It's a sport.

01:48.507 --> 01:50.144
Dad, I'm hungry.

01:50.406 --> 01:52.468
How can you be hungry?
We ate an hour ago.

01:52.469 --> 01:54.504
We didn't eat nachos an hour ago.

01:54.505 --> 01:56.703
What was I thinking about?
Of course, we didn't.

01:56.704 --> 01:57.792
Come on. Let's go.

01:58.546 --> 01:59.600
Hey, get me some.

01:59.601 --> 02:00.388
All right.

02:05.339 --> 02:06.639
Oh! Yeah!

02:07.676 --> 02:09.699
I mean, is this place
great or what, huh?

02:09.701 --> 02:11.585
It's a real ballpark here.

02:11.586 --> 02:12.716
Remember Yankee Stadium?

02:12.717 --> 02:16.162
Uh-huh. Popcorn, we got corndogs.

02:16.163 --> 02:17.795
They don't have that kind of
food at country clubs, do they?

02:17.796 --> 02:19.343
Well, they have hot dogs,

02:19.344 --> 02:21.103
but they don't come on a stick.

02:21.403 --> 02:24.003
No stick? Defeats
the whole purpose.

02:27.878 --> 02:29.540
Come here. Come on.

02:30.796 --> 02:32.485
Excuse me. I'm a
police officer. Yes?

02:32.486 --> 02:34.046
We may have a situation here.

02:34.047 --> 02:35.596
This is my daughter Grace.
I need you

02:35.597 --> 02:37.202
to take her and your
daughter into the bathroom

02:37.203 --> 02:38.585
and wait there until I
get back, all right?

02:38.586 --> 02:40.889
Okay. Thank you.
Hey, come on, kid, listen to me.

02:40.890 --> 02:42.299
This nice lady's gonna
watch you for a little bit.

02:42.300 --> 02:43.735
I want you to go with her,
okay? Daddy...

02:43.736 --> 02:45.157
Hey, I'm just gonna go make sure

02:45.158 --> 02:46.664
there's no bad guys,
that's all... all right?

02:46.665 --> 02:49.174
I'll be right back. Come here.
I love you. Go on.

02:49.461 --> 02:50.586
Okay, come on.

02:56.881 --> 02:57.798
Where are my nachos?

02:57.799 --> 03:00.036
Hey, I'm right in front of you.

03:00.091 --> 03:02.877
Got two guys headed to
the field, strapped.

03:03.469 --> 03:05.017
I think something's
about to go down.

03:05.529 --> 03:06.366
We got trouble.

03:06.367 --> 03:08.141
Kono, call HPD for backup.

03:18.569 --> 03:20.657
Hey, all right Come on, Junior.

03:23.218 --> 03:24.419
Gun! Gun!

03:25.025 --> 03:28.503
Put it down! Put it down! Hey!

03:29.083 --> 03:31.639
Get out of the way!

03:33.125 --> 03:34.337
Black shirt! Runner!

03:34.338 --> 03:35.155
Got him.

03:35.440 --> 03:37.376
Hands behind your head right now...
right now!

03:37.377 --> 03:40.489
Got him. Got him.
Go! Go get Grace!

03:41.882 --> 03:44.311
All right, everybody,
keep the peace and stay calm.

03:44.312 --> 03:45.102
Grace!

03:48.914 --> 03:49.739
Grace!

03:50.072 --> 03:52.122
Daddy! Daddy!

03:53.320 --> 03:54.732
*

03:55.059 --> 03:55.819
Come here.

03:57.969 --> 03:59.693
You okay, huh?

03:59.694 --> 04:00.457
You okay?

04:02.231 --> 04:03.645
Freeze!

04:04.930 --> 04:06.404
Put your hands where
I can see 'em!

04:07.143 --> 04:08.257
Turn around slowly.

04:13.921 --> 04:14.696
Sid?

04:25.561 --> 04:28.335
*

04:30.159 --> 04:32.634
*

04:33.388 --> 04:35.475
*

04:37.782 --> 04:39.983
*

04:41.633 --> 04:44.208
*

04:47.416 --> 04:49.506
*

04:49.507 --> 04:52.536
*

04:59.040 --> 05:00.507
There's no I.D. On this victim.

05:00.508 --> 05:02.347
See if any of the other
witnesses know him.

05:03.085 --> 05:05.197
You're a hell of a quarterback.
What's your name?

05:07.171 --> 05:08.281
Junior Satelli.

05:08.282 --> 05:11.431
Junior, all right, you got lucky today.
It's just a scratch.

05:11.432 --> 05:13.062
Hey, boss, over here.

05:14.168 --> 05:15.139
You're gonna be all right, kid.

05:15.868 --> 05:16.955
Excuse me.

05:19.117 --> 05:20.577
This is one of the shooters.

05:20.578 --> 05:22.065
Do you recognize the art?

05:24.130 --> 05:26.734
It's a 14K tattoo.
This guy's a Triad enforcer.

05:26.735 --> 05:28.005
The other vic is Samoan.

05:28.006 --> 05:29.746
These guys are from
two different gangs.

05:30.159 --> 05:32.758
So what are we looking at here,
a gang war?

05:35.209 --> 05:37.033
The Triads and Samoans have
coexisted on this island

05:37.034 --> 05:39.028
for as long as I can remember.
They never brought

05:39.029 --> 05:40.460
their wars into the public,

05:40.461 --> 05:42.236
especially in front
of their families.

05:43.333 --> 05:44.233
You guys okay?

05:44.411 --> 05:45.785
Yeah, okay. You?

05:46.048 --> 05:47.950
Yeah. I lost my runner
in the parking lot.

05:48.927 --> 05:50.748
That is the most ridiculous thing

05:50.749 --> 05:52.201
I have ever heard in my life.

05:52.213 --> 05:54.139
Violence follows me? I mean,

05:54.140 --> 05:55.976
how do you even come up
with something like that?

05:56.010 --> 05:58.580
No, what happened here has
nothing to do with my job.

05:58.581 --> 06:00.208
In fact, it is just
the opposite, okay?

06:00.209 --> 06:02.560
She is safe because I am a cop.

06:03.185 --> 06:05.009
Huh? You know, I can't,

06:05.010 --> 06:06.435
I can't even do this right now.

06:07.249 --> 06:08.454
She'll be there in five minutes.

06:08.455 --> 06:09.673
An officer's bringing her home.

06:10.218 --> 06:11.706
Yeah. Good-bye.

06:12.537 --> 06:13.746
Can't wait to meet your ex.

06:13.747 --> 06:15.912
Yeah, the two of you
can plan my demise.

06:16.454 --> 06:17.592
So what do we got?

06:18.579 --> 06:20.578
Six friendlies wounded,
two hostiles dead.

06:20.579 --> 06:21.866
Think it was a gang shooting.

06:21.867 --> 06:23.143
Triads and Samoans.

06:26.029 --> 06:27.470
Well, if this is a gang war,

06:27.679 --> 06:29.092
the problem is there's
only gonna be one winner.

06:29.093 --> 06:31.855
Yeah. And the losers:
whoever gets in the way.

06:39.515 --> 06:43.322
*

06:56.337 --> 06:57.198
What do you want?

07:00.644 --> 07:01.428
Where's Sid?

07:03.490 --> 07:04.803
I haven't seen him in months.

07:12.638 --> 07:13.676
She has your eyes.

07:15.387 --> 07:16.175
I gotta go.

07:18.103 --> 07:18.866
All right.

07:19.616 --> 07:21.953
Well, if you see him,
tell him I'm looking for him.

07:28.681 --> 07:31.556
So I got an I.D. On the
target of our gang shooting.

07:31.658 --> 07:33.114
His name is Mana Sapolu.

07:33.115 --> 07:35.276
HPD says he's a
high-ranking lieutenant.

07:35.277 --> 07:37.939
If this is a gang war,
Sapolu might be retaliation.

07:38.189 --> 07:40.462
Crime Reduction Unit says
the Samoans are responsible

07:40.463 --> 07:43.363
for murders of at least seven
Triads in the last six months.

07:43.413 --> 07:45.113
That's why this was so public.

07:45.413 --> 07:47.727
The Triads are sending a message
they're not gonna sit back

07:47.728 --> 07:49.069
and get taken out one-by-one.

07:49.669 --> 07:52.158
Hey, guys! I got something.

07:54.018 --> 07:55.541
Been going through the
cameras left behind,

07:55.542 --> 07:56.465
trying to I.D. the shooters...

07:56.466 --> 07:57.540
This is what I saw.

08:05.248 --> 08:07.548
Wait, wait, wait.
Go back. Rewind that.

08:11.216 --> 08:11.991
Check it out.

08:13.566 --> 08:15.403
That's Junior Satelli,
the quarterback.

08:17.523 --> 08:18.918
So wait a minute-
everyone's running

08:18.919 --> 08:20.696
away from the gunshots,
but this kid Junior's

08:20.697 --> 08:21.622
moving right towards it.

08:21.623 --> 08:22.930
Thought you might
find that interesting,

08:22.931 --> 08:23.996
so I asked around.

08:24.283 --> 08:25.920
Junior's uncle is Mana Sapolu,

08:25.921 --> 08:26.910
r dead Samoan.

08:26.911 --> 08:28.878
Yeah, so he's
probably in the gang.

08:29.088 --> 08:30.463
And knows who the shooters are.

08:30.571 --> 08:31.710
EMTs released him.

08:31.711 --> 08:33.249
I saw him heading
for the locker room.

08:33.663 --> 08:34.462
Come on.

08:36.187 --> 08:36.974
You know, when I was a kid,

08:36.975 --> 08:39.200
this island seemed like
the safest place on Earth.

08:39.201 --> 08:40.169
That's the thing
about being a kid,

08:40.171 --> 08:41.022
you don't know any better.

08:41.023 --> 08:43.145
You could leave your door unlocked,
no one would bother you.

08:43.145 --> 08:44.698
If people had a beef,
they'd settle it

08:44.699 --> 08:46.540
with their fists, not with guns.

08:46.703 --> 08:48.170
Back home, you win a fistfight,

08:48.171 --> 08:49.859
you go home and you
lock the doors twice,

08:49.860 --> 08:52.162
'cause you know somebody's
coming back with a gun. Yeah.

08:52.485 --> 08:54.799
Hawaii's just catching
up to the times.

08:54.800 --> 08:55.647
Maybe.

08:58.371 --> 08:59.958
Hey, there's Junior.

09:03.098 --> 09:04.398
What do you think's in the bag?

09:04.621 --> 09:05.788
I don't know.
I'll give you three-to-one

09:05.789 --> 09:06.816
it ain't his lunch.

09:12.339 --> 09:13.678
Hey! Junior.

09:14.113 --> 09:14.907
How's it?

09:16.575 --> 09:18.100
Let's take a look at your lunch.

09:19.212 --> 09:20.560
Hey, hey, I didn't do nothing.

09:20.561 --> 09:21.674
You didn't do anything yet.

09:21.684 --> 09:23.597
We know Mana Sapolu's your uncle.

09:28.427 --> 09:29.327
What do you got?

09:32.563 --> 09:33.314
Look at that.

09:34.614 --> 09:35.966
What are you thinking, huh?

09:35.967 --> 09:37.005
What are you thinking about?

09:37.061 --> 09:38.511
It's all my fault, man.

09:38.960 --> 09:40.159
I asked him to come
watch me play today,

09:40.160 --> 09:43.151
and if I wouldn't
have done it, he...

09:43.152 --> 09:43.868
You were starting quarterback

09:43.869 --> 09:45.234
in the biggest game of the year.

09:45.584 --> 09:47.294
You think your uncle
was gonna stay away?

09:51.538 --> 09:53.551
You lost someone you
love today, I get that.

09:53.863 --> 09:55.183
But putting another
body in the morgue,

09:55.184 --> 09:57.113
you think that's gonna
make you feel better?

09:58.500 --> 10:00.525
Junior, tell us where
we can find the men

10:00.526 --> 10:01.553
who shot your uncle.

10:02.166 --> 10:04.853
I promise you we'll
take 'em off the street.

10:06.755 --> 10:08.081
International Marketplace.

10:09.264 --> 10:10.539
The guys that did this...

10:11.463 --> 10:12.130
they just started using

10:12.131 --> 10:13.972
the store trains to front
their meth business.

10:15.191 --> 10:15.929
All right.

10:16.503 --> 10:19.253
If I see you anywhere
but a football field,

10:19.491 --> 10:20.627
I will arrest you.

10:21.577 --> 10:22.326
You understand?

10:22.327 --> 10:23.327
Yes. Go home.

10:23.464 --> 10:24.833
Excuse me? Go.

10:24.834 --> 10:26.767
Hold on, hold on.
Wait, whoa-whoa-whoa.

10:27.156 --> 10:29.155
Go. Whoa-whoa-whoa!

10:29.850 --> 10:32.138
Okay, let me ask you a question.

10:32.325 --> 10:34.914
What the hell is the
matter with you, huh?!

10:34.915 --> 10:35.762
He's just a kid.

10:35.763 --> 10:36.787
No, he's not just a kid.

10:36.788 --> 10:37.990
He's a kid with a gun, okay?

10:37.991 --> 10:38.493
What, did you want me

10:38.494 --> 10:41.055
to book him, Danno?
You think that's funny?

10:41.693 --> 10:43.530
Let me break it
down for you, okay?

10:43.611 --> 10:47.450
Kids with guns kill
innocent people and cops!

10:47.451 --> 10:48.657
Right. All right, now, that kid,

10:48.658 --> 10:50.619
maybe he's going to
finish a math assignment,

10:50.620 --> 10:52.666
but more likely he's
looking for another gun

10:52.667 --> 10:54.304
so he can shoot someone!

10:54.305 --> 10:56.640
Why? 'Cause you
conveniently just decided

10:56.641 --> 10:57.753
to forget about the law!

10:57.754 --> 10:59.601
He's angry because
somebody came along

10:59.602 --> 11:01.421
and killed a member
of his family today.

11:01.422 --> 11:03.715
And he feels like if he
doesn't do something about it,

11:03.716 --> 11:04.679
nobody will.

11:05.291 --> 11:06.566
So let's prove him wrong.

11:07.770 --> 11:09.469
Come on, we got a killer to catch.

11:09.486 --> 11:11.423
There's something wrong with you,
you know that, right?

11:12.678 --> 11:15.541
*

11:43.670 --> 11:46.120
So you like to kill people
on football fields, huh?

11:47.658 --> 11:50.219
You're under arrest for
the murder of Manu Sapolu.

12:00.318 --> 12:02.143
That's because these girls are like,
"Give us some money."

12:08.517 --> 12:10.171
Go ahead, take the girls
back to the house.

12:24.532 --> 12:25.782
What the hell are you doing here?

12:27.193 --> 12:28.232
There's a tape of the game.

12:28.743 --> 12:29.805
It's only a matter of time

12:29.806 --> 12:31.393
before you're I.D.'d and arrested.

12:32.046 --> 12:33.655
What are you talking about, cuz?

12:34.034 --> 12:35.646
You were the one pointing the gun.

12:35.667 --> 12:38.045
Listen to me. You need
to come with me right now

12:38.046 --> 12:39.042
and talk to my people.

12:39.685 --> 12:40.510
Your people?

12:40.584 --> 12:43.170
You mean the drug dealers you
ripped off when you were a cop.

12:43.750 --> 12:44.988
Stay away from me.

12:47.505 --> 12:48.467
What the hell are you doing?!

12:48.766 --> 12:49.803
I'm a cop again.

12:49.834 --> 12:51.534
I was trying to cut you a break.

12:51.809 --> 12:53.708
I was trying to do
things a different way.

12:54.621 --> 12:55.621
I guess I was wrong.

12:56.861 --> 12:58.274
Hey! Ow!

12:58.824 --> 12:59.711
Come on! In here.

12:59.967 --> 13:02.377
Give me a break! Have a seat!

13:05.048 --> 13:05.911
What's going on?

13:07.011 --> 13:09.720
This is Sid. He was
at the football game.

13:09.756 --> 13:11.082
And part of a Samoan gang.

13:11.370 --> 13:14.232
Kono? Don't tell me
you're working with them?

13:15.507 --> 13:16.433
How do you know him?

13:17.820 --> 13:19.051
He's our cousin. He's our cousin.

13:19.526 --> 13:20.789
I'm also a cop.

13:36.418 --> 13:37.218
You're a cop?

13:37.493 --> 13:38.430
Undercover.

13:39.005 --> 13:40.454
Chin said you quit the HPD.

13:41.580 --> 13:43.305
That would have been
the easy way out.

13:44.391 --> 13:46.865
Before I took this assignment,
I had the whole department

13:46.866 --> 13:49.706
coming down on me just because
I shared blood with this thief.

13:49.707 --> 13:50.782
Watch your mouth.

13:52.032 --> 13:54.482
All right, just got off
the phone with HPD.

13:55.432 --> 13:56.645
His story checks out.

13:57.235 --> 13:58.674
He's working with the gang unit.

13:58.675 --> 14:00.723
They got him undercover
with the Samoans.

14:02.031 --> 14:03.709
That's what I was
trying to tell you.

14:03.710 --> 14:05.230
The police department
said that I quit

14:05.231 --> 14:06.460
to set up my cover.

14:06.785 --> 14:08.965
I've been under with the
Samoan gangs for 11 months.

14:08.966 --> 14:10.559
Trying to identify
the major players

14:10.560 --> 14:11.640
and collect enough evidence

14:11.641 --> 14:13.196
to take them down
on Federal warrants.

14:13.197 --> 14:15.097
What can you tell us
about this gang war?

14:17.713 --> 14:20.237
I ain't saying another word
in front of this dirty cop.

14:20.442 --> 14:22.830
You want to believe I took money
from drug raids, that's fine.

14:23.255 --> 14:25.029
But you're going to
tell us what you know.

14:26.179 --> 14:27.654
I'll tell these two.

14:29.345 --> 14:30.732
I ain't talking to you.

14:51.061 --> 14:52.785
You saw Sid at the football game,
didn't you?

14:54.592 --> 14:55.529
And you let him go.

14:56.679 --> 14:58.104
He wasn't involved
in the shooting.

14:59.016 --> 15:00.016
He was trying to get away.

15:01.241 --> 15:03.815
You give him a pass
because he's family.

15:05.603 --> 15:06.790
They didn't do that for you.

15:15.048 --> 15:16.198
Been working my way up.

15:16.497 --> 15:17.972
They're starting to trust me.

15:18.526 --> 15:20.190
For the past six months,
I was muscle

15:20.191 --> 15:21.683
for their call girl operations.

15:21.684 --> 15:24.171
And finally starting to get in
some of their security work.

15:24.617 --> 15:26.304
From what I've been
able to put together,

15:27.128 --> 15:28.766
this beef with the Triads

15:28.796 --> 15:30.771
was instigated by the Samoans.

15:31.411 --> 15:32.591
Why? No idea.

15:32.592 --> 15:33.665
But from what I been hearing,

15:33.666 --> 15:35.543
it's going to get a lot
worse before it gets better.

15:35.741 --> 15:37.378
We're in the business
of making things better,

15:37.379 --> 15:39.003
so why don't you tell
us where to start.

15:42.289 --> 15:44.100
There's a repair
shop over on Lagoon

15:44.101 --> 15:46.339
Samoans sometimes
use for deliveries.

15:46.454 --> 15:48.316
Been a lot of activity
over there lately.

15:48.805 --> 15:51.818
Not sure what... but I
heard it something to do

15:51.819 --> 15:54.267
with muscling the Triads
out of one of the rackets.

15:54.767 --> 15:56.178
If you're looking for answers...

15:56.267 --> 15:57.329
I'd start there.

16:01.848 --> 16:04.722
So this is where Sid thinks the
Samoans are doing business.

16:04.973 --> 16:07.269
What kind of business?
I'd say chop shop,

16:07.270 --> 16:09.922
but I can't see anyone stealing
and stripping these hoopties.

16:11.947 --> 16:13.409
You know, I was thinking about it.

16:13.684 --> 16:16.009
I think you should send
Chin home for a couple days.

16:18.158 --> 16:20.287
Law enforcement is
Chin's family business,

16:20.288 --> 16:22.941
so when he lost his badge,
he lost his family.

16:22.942 --> 16:24.366
If he wants to wear a badge,

16:24.367 --> 16:26.083
he has to be able to deal
with things like this.

16:26.283 --> 16:28.295
You weren't held when you
were a baby, were you?

16:28.558 --> 16:30.245
It's called tough love, partner.

16:35.945 --> 16:38.172
Oh, and by the way, I was held.

16:38.173 --> 16:40.414
Okay? I have photos,
if you want proof.

16:41.589 --> 16:42.476
Photoshop.

16:43.436 --> 16:44.587
So you say something? No.

16:49.460 --> 16:51.197
Have to give the Samoans props.

16:51.237 --> 16:53.174
Sure can pack away the pies.

16:53.412 --> 16:55.086
Right? That's a lot of pizza.

16:55.719 --> 16:56.556
Maybe not.

16:58.105 --> 16:58.831
Look at this.

17:00.492 --> 17:01.220
What do you see?

17:03.372 --> 17:04.406
I don't see anything.

17:04.446 --> 17:05.185
Exactly.

17:05.186 --> 17:07.060
No cheese drips, no grease stains.

17:07.661 --> 17:08.948
Nothing. No crust.

17:09.924 --> 17:11.097
Doesn't that seem strange to you?

17:11.098 --> 17:13.835
Not half as strange as it must
to a man who lives on take-out.

17:13.836 --> 17:16.759
What do they deliver in these
boxes is what I'm saying.

17:19.397 --> 17:21.862
Okay, all right, what's that look?

17:21.863 --> 17:22.410
What look?

17:22.411 --> 17:23.781
The look... the look you give me

17:23.781 --> 17:25.119
when you don't tell me
what you're thinking about.

17:25.121 --> 17:26.364
Next thing I know,
I'm getting shot at.

17:26.365 --> 17:28.979
Looking for iodine. Iodine.

17:28.980 --> 17:29.737
Iodine.

17:29.738 --> 17:31.287
Look at that, mystery solved.

17:31.288 --> 17:33.503
Grab one of those boxes,
put it on this table here.

17:38.241 --> 17:39.566
Right here? Yeah.

17:44.316 --> 17:46.116
Okay, enough already.
What are we doing here?

17:46.261 --> 17:50.755
When iodine mixes with metal,
it forms binary salts.

17:50.756 --> 17:52.956
Binary salts... all right.

17:53.231 --> 17:54.688
Is there a reason for
this chemistry lesson?

17:54.689 --> 17:56.789
Pay attention.
You might learn something.

17:57.272 --> 17:59.061
Any metallic objects

17:59.873 --> 18:01.422
that were left in those boxes...

18:03.314 --> 18:05.081
...will have left
trace elements behind.

18:05.082 --> 18:07.721
The iodine will bring it
out in a couple of seconds.

18:12.314 --> 18:13.064
Wow.

18:16.589 --> 18:18.369
Thick crust,
extra bullets, please.

18:18.370 --> 18:19.083
Yeah.

18:20.933 --> 18:23.045
Come on, I can use a
good slice. Let's go.

18:32.366 --> 18:34.578
You know what? This place
actually sounds all right.

18:34.916 --> 18:37.378
I'm sure it does. It says
here they fly in the water.

18:37.891 --> 18:39.165
That's great. Yeah.

18:39.359 --> 18:40.725
This town could use a good slice.

18:40.726 --> 18:42.365
It's a shame we got to
put them out of business.

18:42.552 --> 18:44.739
You should try
Iolani's in Waikiki.

18:44.740 --> 18:47.501
They do the best ham and pineapple
on the Island... Oh! Oh!

18:47.502 --> 18:48.200
What?

18:48.523 --> 18:50.423
Let me explain
something to you, okay?

18:50.424 --> 18:53.623
Pizza is mozz, sauce and dough.

18:53.624 --> 18:54.449
That is it.

18:54.649 --> 18:57.020
All right, you want to put
a pepperoni on your slice

18:57.021 --> 18:58.761
that's fine, but ham, out.

18:58.808 --> 19:00.033
Fruit, out.

19:00.036 --> 19:02.496
Okay, I don't care where we are.
Pizza and pineapple

19:02.497 --> 19:04.313
do not belong in
the same airspace.

19:05.769 --> 19:08.005
I guess you feel quite
strongly about this.

19:09.368 --> 19:12.017
That's cute. Did your
ex get a new one, too?

19:12.018 --> 19:14.068
No, it's... miserable attorney.

19:14.993 --> 19:16.329
Yes, Lord Vader.

19:19.130 --> 19:20.243
Is that a joke?

19:22.041 --> 19:23.474
Yeah, over my dead body.

19:23.475 --> 19:25.056
Let me explain to you why.

19:25.093 --> 19:27.405
She is my daughter too, okay?

19:28.542 --> 19:29.369
I don't care.

19:29.370 --> 19:31.320
Hey, hey! Listen to me!

19:31.432 --> 19:33.146
You scumbag.

19:33.147 --> 19:36.434
You low-life, miserable,
money-suck...

19:36.435 --> 19:37.759
Hello? Hello?!

19:38.912 --> 19:39.847
Uh! Uh!

19:42.840 --> 19:44.443
Okay. What up?

19:44.444 --> 19:48.041
Rachel is trying to
take me back to court

19:48.042 --> 19:51.729
over visitation, because she
says that it is not safe

19:51.891 --> 19:53.290
for Grace to be around me.

19:53.291 --> 19:54.734
Like the football
shooting was my fault.

19:54.735 --> 19:55.885
Aw, man...

19:58.334 --> 19:59.271
I'm sorry.

20:11.090 --> 20:12.369
Hey, you the owner?

20:13.055 --> 20:15.052
Pie or slice, officers?

20:15.053 --> 20:16.427
We want to ask you
a couple questions.

20:16.428 --> 20:17.440
You mind turning that off?

20:17.441 --> 20:19.040
I got money on this fight.

20:19.528 --> 20:21.240
Okay. I got it.

20:24.791 --> 20:26.741
You have no idea where
you are, do you?

20:27.391 --> 20:29.628
Well, we know we're
not in New York, huh?

20:29.987 --> 20:32.940
From your accent I'd say Jersey...
West Orange?

20:33.078 --> 20:35.177
Bingo. You, too?

20:35.229 --> 20:36.003
Yeah.

20:36.332 --> 20:37.582
You're a long way from home.

20:37.844 --> 20:38.944
Yeah, don't remind me.

20:38.971 --> 20:41.371
You've been making deliveries
to Kamomi Auto Shop?

20:41.501 --> 20:44.368
Yeah. I make a lot of
deliveries to a lot of places.

20:44.369 --> 20:45.176
I'll bet you do.

20:47.251 --> 20:48.779
This one was a special order.

20:52.070 --> 20:54.356
Look, I just deliver the pizzas,
man, you know?

20:54.357 --> 20:56.392
What people choose to put
in the boxes afterwards,

20:56.704 --> 20:57.730
that's up to them.

20:58.266 --> 21:00.216
Now if you gentlemen have
any more questions...

21:01.279 --> 21:02.429
speak to my lawyer.

21:04.989 --> 21:05.900
Hey, I tried.

21:05.901 --> 21:07.211
I thought you were
very reasonable.

21:07.212 --> 21:07.828
Your turn.

21:08.309 --> 21:09.096
Oh...!

21:18.646 --> 21:21.299
You guys have been watching
too many gangster movies.

21:21.300 --> 21:22.503
How do you figure?

21:22.870 --> 21:24.745
This whole death march routine.

21:25.058 --> 21:26.830
Like I'm supposed to
believe a couple of cops

21:26.831 --> 21:28.686
are going to cap me and
dump me in the ocean.

21:28.687 --> 21:29.512
Please.

21:30.413 --> 21:31.899
We're not going to
shoot you, Joey.

21:31.900 --> 21:33.450
Whoo, that's a load off.

21:33.922 --> 21:36.472
Hey, Joey, you got an 'aumakua?

21:36.932 --> 21:37.932
What'd you call me?

21:38.182 --> 21:39.469
An 'aumakua.

21:39.954 --> 21:42.268
No, what's an 'aum... what's that?

21:42.490 --> 21:45.625
Some Hawaiians believe that
the spirits of their ancestors

21:45.626 --> 21:48.305
appear in other living forms.

21:48.454 --> 21:50.552
Oh, for instance, like a shark.

21:50.626 --> 21:51.338
Right?

21:51.813 --> 21:54.286
And that those animals,
those specific animals,

21:54.287 --> 21:56.827
will be there to protect
them in times of need.

22:02.826 --> 22:03.592
Looks like you could use

22:03.593 --> 22:05.914
one of those 'aumakuas
right about now, Joey.

22:07.844 --> 22:09.913
Hey... What the hell, man?

22:09.914 --> 22:11.582
Those dolphins? Huh? Hey, hey.

22:11.583 --> 22:13.350
Tell me those are dolphins! Hey,
hey, hey, hey.

22:14.006 --> 22:15.269
Are those sharks?

22:15.602 --> 22:17.552
No! No! Come on, Joey.

22:24.853 --> 22:25.752
Hey!

22:26.177 --> 22:27.777
Hey! Hey!

22:31.022 --> 22:32.115
Get me out of here!

22:32.116 --> 22:34.266
You let us know when
you're ready to talk, Joey.

22:34.666 --> 22:35.716
Don't leave me!

22:36.028 --> 22:37.777
Help! Hey!

22:37.991 --> 22:38.653
Hey!

22:38.991 --> 22:41.115
Don't leave me here! Hey!

22:42.973 --> 22:44.423
Hey... Wait!

22:46.873 --> 22:47.810
Hey!

22:48.926 --> 22:50.441
Wait! Wait!

22:51.507 --> 22:52.819
Get me out of here!

22:54.854 --> 22:55.578
Let me ask you a question.

22:55.579 --> 22:57.634
Are you literally insane?
Oh, relax.

22:57.635 --> 22:58.977
It's a cage for tourists.

22:58.978 --> 23:01.367
They're... they're
homeless Galapagos sharks.

23:01.584 --> 23:02.896
They're not man-eaters.

23:03.216 --> 23:05.026
Hey!

23:05.027 --> 23:06.223
Joey doesn't know that, though.

23:07.318 --> 23:09.568
Hey, you want a beer? Yeah.

23:12.053 --> 23:13.596
To, uh... to Joey.

23:13.597 --> 23:14.446
Help!

23:18.336 --> 23:20.287
Hey, what are you going
to do about your ex, man?

23:22.198 --> 23:23.434
I have no idea.

23:27.422 --> 23:28.864
Gracie's my life.

23:29.234 --> 23:31.159
If I lose her,
I got no reason to be here.

23:31.833 --> 23:33.009
I'd be alone on this island.

23:34.646 --> 23:37.421
Hey! Wait!

23:37.909 --> 23:39.196
Well, you still got Joey.

23:39.493 --> 23:40.241
Yeah.

23:41.495 --> 23:42.667
Hey! Hey!

23:42.668 --> 23:44.205
We should go get him.

23:44.926 --> 23:45.788
All right, all right.

23:45.789 --> 23:47.513
Just get me out of here! Okay.
All right.

23:47.651 --> 23:49.423
Why are you running
guns to the Samoans?

23:49.424 --> 23:50.660
I got business with them.

23:50.661 --> 23:52.886
I know you got business with 'em-
what kind of business?

23:55.450 --> 23:56.976
Samoans are helping
us squeeze the Triads

23:56.977 --> 23:59.662
out of their gambling operations.

24:03.133 --> 24:04.516
We got the guns and money.

24:04.517 --> 24:07.270
The Samoans got the muscle
and the local what's-what.

24:07.418 --> 24:09.679
And that's all I know.
I swear. Please!

24:09.680 --> 24:11.280
Hey! Hey! Hey!

24:12.434 --> 24:13.258
Who's "We"?

24:13.259 --> 24:14.389
Who are you working for?

24:14.589 --> 24:16.641
Salvo. Frank Salvo?

24:16.651 --> 24:19.730
Yeah! Yeah! He's coming
to town tomorrow.

24:20.755 --> 24:21.468
Why?

24:21.761 --> 24:24.016
Because the guy he brokered
the deal with got clipped.

24:24.017 --> 24:26.584
You know, the guy who got
shot at the football game.

24:27.081 --> 24:29.043
Salvo wants to see the operation

24:29.638 --> 24:32.000
and sit down with the new
boss of the Samoan gang

24:32.225 --> 24:33.055
and make sure
everything's straight.

24:33.056 --> 24:34.541
Joey, hold up a second.

24:35.965 --> 24:36.939
Who's Salvo?

24:38.086 --> 24:39.248
Frank Salvo is the head

24:39.249 --> 24:41.537
of the Salvo crime
family back in Jersey.

24:41.538 --> 24:42.840
If he's the one
pulling the strings,

24:42.841 --> 24:44.799
the real war hasn't
even begun yet.

24:50.974 --> 24:52.141
Frank Salvo.

24:52.142 --> 24:53.964
Suspected of a half dozen kills.

24:53.965 --> 24:55.583
Three years ago, he put a bullet

24:55.584 --> 24:56.819
in his uncle to take
over the family.

24:56.820 --> 24:58.106
His crews do it all.

24:58.107 --> 24:59.605
Okay? They got prostitution,

24:59.606 --> 25:01.257
loan-sharking, protection,

25:01.258 --> 25:02.831
drugs... you name it.

25:02.981 --> 25:05.167
The only racket they don't
have is illegal gambling

25:05.168 --> 25:06.631
'cause Atlantic City
gets all the action.

25:06.632 --> 25:08.356
That's why he's setting
up shop out here.

25:08.357 --> 25:11.313
Of course. Honolulu just shot
down legalized gambling again.

25:11.314 --> 25:13.406
Salvo knows this is an
island of opportunity.

25:13.544 --> 25:14.781
He takes over illegal gambling,

25:14.782 --> 25:15.744
does things his way.

25:15.745 --> 25:18.281
Let me tell you,
he will spread like a virus.

25:18.370 --> 25:20.568
Okay, and since the New Jersey
Mob doesn't like partners,

25:20.569 --> 25:23.006
it's only a matter of time
before they cut out the Samoans.

25:23.065 --> 25:25.529
Once that happens,
every street from Mauka to Makai

25:25.530 --> 25:27.197
will be as bloody as
that football field.

25:27.285 --> 25:29.735
Well, we have to
eliminate the virus.

25:29.922 --> 25:30.634
How?

25:31.359 --> 25:33.889
According to Joey,
Salvo is here for a sit-down

25:33.890 --> 25:35.232
with the new head
of the Samoan gang.

25:35.233 --> 25:37.984
This guy... Tuinei.
Manu Sapolu's underboss.

25:37.985 --> 25:38.674
Right.

25:38.675 --> 25:40.509
Tomorrow night is
Tuinei's big audition

25:40.510 --> 25:42.161
to see if he can
run these casinos.

25:42.537 --> 25:43.908
We need to be on the inside,

25:43.909 --> 25:46.199
getting Salvo on tape,
spelling out the punch.

25:47.524 --> 25:48.961
Okay, how are we going to do that?

25:52.029 --> 25:53.142
What do you need, cuz?

25:53.660 --> 25:54.835
Said it was urgent.

25:55.460 --> 25:57.172
There's a rolling casino tonight.

25:57.434 --> 25:58.347
Can you get us in?

25:58.943 --> 26:01.379
I said I was working security
detail for something.

26:02.032 --> 26:03.290
Then, will you do it?

26:03.973 --> 26:05.520
Putting me in a tough spot, kid.

26:05.909 --> 26:06.783
This thing goes south,

26:06.784 --> 26:08.597
I risk compromising
my investigation.

26:09.284 --> 26:10.653
I wouldn't be asking
you to do this

26:10.654 --> 26:11.976
if I didn't think that
we had a real shot

26:11.977 --> 26:13.323
at ending this gang war.

26:13.824 --> 26:16.936
I'll help you, but I don't want
anything to do with Chin Ho.

26:19.065 --> 26:20.702
That's cold, brah.

26:21.094 --> 26:22.419
That is still family.

26:23.044 --> 26:24.594
You think I want to feel this way?

26:25.244 --> 26:26.781
We were boys, me and Chin.

26:27.605 --> 26:28.568
I thought I knew him.

26:28.643 --> 26:29.770
You do know him.

26:30.055 --> 26:32.431
I know that what he did
set me back with HPD.

26:33.436 --> 26:34.663
I know if I'm not the one

26:34.664 --> 26:36.149
volunteering for
the hardest jobs...

26:36.150 --> 26:37.706
the ones that nobody will take...

26:37.707 --> 26:39.244
they're going to
think I'm dirty, too.

26:39.919 --> 26:41.561
You think I like
living in a tenement?

26:41.562 --> 26:43.683
Away from my wife and
baby almost a year.

26:44.183 --> 26:46.309
That's what being related
to Chin Ho did for me.

26:46.310 --> 26:47.283
Do you ever think for a second

26:47.284 --> 26:48.700
that maybe he didn't do anything?

26:49.050 --> 26:50.149
That maybe he was set up?

26:50.150 --> 26:52.137
All that matters is
what the bosses think,

26:52.212 --> 26:53.749
and they took his badge away.

26:54.428 --> 26:56.598
To think anything else
is career suicide.

26:56.599 --> 26:57.700
He protected you at
the football field,

26:57.701 --> 26:58.835
and this is how you pay him back.

26:59.085 --> 27:01.934
He thought I was a gangbanger,
and he let me go.

27:02.146 --> 27:03.794
What kind of cop does that?

27:03.795 --> 27:06.245
The kind that knows how
to look after his family.

27:11.997 --> 27:13.409
I worry about you, Kono.

27:14.610 --> 27:16.212
You know those HPD guys,

27:16.213 --> 27:17.807
the ones that you
depend on for back up?

27:17.808 --> 27:19.457
You think they don't
know who your cousin is?

27:19.458 --> 27:21.445
They're wrong about him,
and so are you.

27:21.720 --> 27:23.007
He's a good man.

27:25.720 --> 27:26.554
Listen, kid.

27:26.555 --> 27:28.877
If you want my help, you got it.

27:29.435 --> 27:31.460
But not Chin. End of story.

27:31.853 --> 27:33.278
He's not going undercover.

27:33.705 --> 27:35.305
Everyone knows him on the island.

27:35.306 --> 27:37.367
It's just me, McGarrett and Danny.

27:40.155 --> 27:42.687
I can probably get you in if
you don't mind serving drinks.

27:42.856 --> 27:44.393
I don't know about the two haoles.

27:44.655 --> 27:45.831
They clean up nice.

27:46.131 --> 27:47.318
They can go as whales.

27:48.299 --> 27:49.086
Trust me.

28:01.193 --> 28:01.948
Detour.

28:01.949 --> 28:05.047
I beg of you. I beg of you.

28:10.890 --> 28:13.828
What are you doing?
Turn around! Turn around!

28:42.263 --> 28:43.938
I'm in. Copy that.

28:45.439 --> 28:46.976
I have house security online.

29:13.089 --> 29:16.226
*

29:16.753 --> 29:17.548
Aloha, gentlemen.

29:17.549 --> 29:18.261
Name?

29:19.726 --> 29:20.699
Edwards.

29:28.333 --> 29:29.684
They're good to go.

29:29.685 --> 29:30.549
Let them in.

29:38.468 --> 29:39.218
*

29:49.634 --> 29:51.084
That guy's all yours.

29:51.214 --> 29:52.077
Very large.

29:52.919 --> 29:53.569
We're in.

29:53.570 --> 29:54.169
Gotcha.

29:54.170 --> 29:55.445
And you're loud and clear.

29:59.602 --> 30:01.301
Vaveni and soda, please.

30:01.777 --> 30:02.420
What do I look like?

30:02.421 --> 30:04.144
Try one of the ladies
holding drinks.

30:04.369 --> 30:06.081
Yeah, good idea, right?

30:07.767 --> 30:09.747
How come I look like a waiter,
you look like James Bond?

30:09.748 --> 30:10.555
I don't know.

30:10.592 --> 30:13.080
He doesn't know what he's
talking about. Clearly.

30:14.221 --> 30:15.296
Mind if we join you?

30:19.258 --> 30:20.170
Ten to start.

30:27.327 --> 30:29.448
Gentlemen, Salvo's on his way in

30:29.449 --> 30:31.339
with Tuinei, new Samoan boss.

30:42.708 --> 30:43.541
Shall we?

30:52.646 --> 30:53.483
What do you think?

30:55.008 --> 30:56.438
Think he's got an ace.

31:08.272 --> 31:09.720
Such serious men.

31:10.687 --> 31:11.636
How about a...

31:11.648 --> 31:13.011
drink before business?

31:14.256 --> 31:15.531
Whiskey, straight up.

31:16.881 --> 31:17.856
Beer in the bottle.

31:30.623 --> 31:31.586
Thank you, sweetheart.

31:33.157 --> 31:34.030
Enjoy.

31:34.031 --> 31:34.968
Hope you like it.

31:37.660 --> 31:39.322
Got to come out here more often.

31:39.930 --> 31:42.516
All right, look.
Now that Sapolu's gone,

31:42.517 --> 31:45.165
my friends on the mainland
are a little concerned

31:45.166 --> 31:47.477
that you could do everything
that Manu said you could.

31:47.478 --> 31:48.617
We can, and we will.

31:48.915 --> 31:50.252
We're more motivated than ever

31:50.253 --> 31:51.476
to take out the Triads.

31:51.477 --> 31:52.703
That's what I'm afraid of.

31:52.704 --> 31:55.132
We're not shipping out
all this firepower

31:55.133 --> 31:56.973
and cash for you to finance

31:56.974 --> 31:58.760
some never-ending gang war.

31:58.761 --> 31:59.862
You're getting paid

31:59.863 --> 32:02.678
to get the Triads out
of the gambling business

32:02.679 --> 32:06.012
so that we can go on with
our operation uncontested.

32:06.013 --> 32:06.753
That's it.

32:06.953 --> 32:08.727
Then your money is
being well spent.

32:08.828 --> 32:10.164
You've seen for yourself.

32:10.453 --> 32:12.027
The rooms are up and running.

32:12.028 --> 32:13.561
What's going on?

32:13.562 --> 32:15.131
These two names-
I have to take...

32:15.132 --> 32:16.025
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

32:16.026 --> 32:17.218
I cleared them.
They're good to go.

32:17.219 --> 32:18.899
The boss wants to see it.

32:20.246 --> 32:22.658
Guys, I'm getting a bad
feeling about this.

32:23.530 --> 32:26.669
I need to know from you
that you and your people

32:26.670 --> 32:29.054
are going to protect
my investment.

32:29.092 --> 32:30.017
What is this?

32:31.164 --> 32:32.752
I think you need to see this.

32:35.190 --> 32:36.516
You know what to do.

32:37.640 --> 32:38.415
Something wrong?

32:40.871 --> 32:42.520
How is it that you people

32:42.521 --> 32:44.310
have been fumbling around

32:44.311 --> 32:47.582
on this moss-covered
rock for generations,

32:48.033 --> 32:50.019
and in two seconds, my men

32:50.020 --> 32:51.897
find two names on that list

32:51.898 --> 32:52.994
that don't check out?

32:52.995 --> 32:53.982
We've been made.

32:55.421 --> 32:57.509
Get Sid in here.
He's running the gate.

32:57.510 --> 32:58.509
I want to see him right now.

32:58.510 --> 33:00.021
My men are handling Sid.

33:00.495 --> 33:02.908
You just find the two
men that he let in here.

33:12.566 --> 33:13.766
Where did they take Sid?

33:15.888 --> 33:17.098
Salvo's got him by the pool.

33:17.099 --> 33:17.936
He's in trouble.

33:20.847 --> 33:22.346
I'm coming in with backup now.

33:29.092 --> 33:31.104
Can I help you? Invitation only.

33:38.695 --> 33:40.033
Tell me what I want to know,

33:40.578 --> 33:42.665
I make it fast and painless.

33:43.200 --> 33:45.174
That's very considerate of you.

33:49.237 --> 33:51.238
It is when you consider
the other option.

33:51.239 --> 33:54.914
Which is I put one in your gut
and I watch you bleed out.

33:55.164 --> 33:56.981
Because that's exactly
what's gonna happen

33:56.982 --> 33:58.614
if you don't start talking.

34:00.550 --> 34:02.913
Now, who are those two
guys you let in here?

34:04.263 --> 34:05.787
And are you a cop?

34:20.969 --> 34:22.408
Get them the hell out of here!

34:22.906 --> 34:24.972
No, we can't... Oh, oh, hey.

34:24.973 --> 34:27.581
Guys, I'm really sorry.
We don't want any trouble.

34:27.792 --> 34:28.554
Hey!

34:32.380 --> 34:33.179
Use the gun!

35:26.149 --> 35:28.196
*

35:49.343 --> 35:50.718
Rachel, just hear me out.

35:51.241 --> 35:53.265
All right, before you
sic your lawyers on me

35:53.530 --> 35:55.294
and try to take
Grace away from me,

35:55.295 --> 35:56.882
I want to remind you of something.

35:57.607 --> 36:00.498
I moved 5,000 miles

36:00.499 --> 36:03.082
so that I could see
Grace twice a week.

36:03.403 --> 36:04.577
Twice a week, okay?

36:04.578 --> 36:07.147
That is 48 hours, 52 times a year,

36:07.148 --> 36:09.953
for a grand total of 2,500 hours.

36:10.507 --> 36:13.069
When you factor in
sleep and school,

36:13.156 --> 36:14.659
I can really only count on about

36:14.660 --> 36:16.806
400 hours of real
face time each year.

36:17.935 --> 36:19.654
And then, you know,
that's only gonna shrink

36:19.655 --> 36:20.909
when she starts making friends

36:20.910 --> 36:23.197
and then she goes off to college.

36:28.155 --> 36:31.282
So, ultimately, that does not
leave me with a lot of time

36:31.283 --> 36:32.681
to spend with my daughter.

36:33.331 --> 36:35.406
Not as much as I would want.

36:36.065 --> 36:37.627
But I never complained.

36:37.764 --> 36:38.613
I never complained,

36:38.614 --> 36:40.231
because every single
one of those minutes

36:40.232 --> 36:43.064
reminds me of what I am
doing and why I am here.

36:45.601 --> 36:47.601
That little girl is my life.

36:49.239 --> 36:52.045
So I am asking you,
I am begging you, Rachel,

36:52.046 --> 36:56.846
to please, please, just be kind...

36:58.125 --> 36:59.349
and don't take her away from me.

36:59.350 --> 37:00.113
That's all.

37:01.487 --> 37:04.100
I will get Miss Rachel, sir.

37:06.056 --> 37:08.269
Detective Williams,
this is Rachel's counsel.

37:09.126 --> 37:10.939
Yeah, will you put
Rachel on, please?

37:11.355 --> 37:12.705
That won't be necessary.

37:13.113 --> 37:15.701
Don't tell me what's necessary,
just do what I tell you to do.

37:15.721 --> 37:17.634
Rachel's dropping the petition.

37:18.534 --> 37:19.158
She's what?

37:19.159 --> 37:21.308
She's decided not to
fight you for visitation.

37:27.057 --> 37:28.027
Daddy!

37:28.414 --> 37:29.825
Hi, monkey.

37:30.575 --> 37:31.437
God!

37:35.838 --> 37:38.314
Guess what? I think I know
what I want for my birthday.

37:38.315 --> 37:39.074
Tell me.

37:39.199 --> 37:41.060
A football... a squishy pink one.

37:41.061 --> 37:42.274
A squishy pink one?

37:42.430 --> 37:43.181
Oh!

37:44.230 --> 37:44.929
Oh.

37:45.333 --> 37:47.541
That's the second best
news I've heard all day.

37:59.995 --> 38:00.694
Hey.

38:00.929 --> 38:01.499
Hey.

38:01.500 --> 38:03.320
So, uh, HPD is rolling out

38:03.321 --> 38:04.737
the red carpet for Sid.

38:04.807 --> 38:05.432
What do you mean?

38:05.433 --> 38:07.026
Well, he goes
undercover for a year,

38:07.027 --> 38:08.681
basically ends the gang war.

38:08.682 --> 38:09.952
Now he helps us get Salvo.

38:09.953 --> 38:11.159
That guy's a hero now.

38:11.457 --> 38:13.319
So are he and Chin cool then?

38:13.320 --> 38:14.357
I don't know if I'd say "Cool,"

38:14.358 --> 38:15.882
more like defrosting, you know.

38:15.883 --> 38:16.820
It's gonna take time.

38:17.133 --> 38:18.693
It's a hell of a grudge
to hang onto, man.

38:18.694 --> 38:20.174
Chin saved that guy's life.

38:20.486 --> 38:21.720
Yeah, that reminds me,

38:21.721 --> 38:23.425
did you, uh, speak to the governor

38:23.426 --> 38:24.794
about my custody issue?

38:25.106 --> 38:27.243
Governor doesn't discuss
her business with me.

38:28.856 --> 38:30.777
I might have heard something
about Step-Stan building

38:30.778 --> 38:31.940
a new hotel, though, and, uh,

38:31.941 --> 38:33.672
you need government
approval for that.

38:35.907 --> 38:36.691
Thank you.

38:38.402 --> 38:39.690
Let me ask you something.

38:40.060 --> 38:41.771
How far deep did you have to dig?

38:41.772 --> 38:43.647
I mean, how much of your soul

38:43.648 --> 38:45.936
did you just lose by
actually appreciating me?

38:47.310 --> 38:49.188
Uh, I'm measuring.

38:50.574 --> 38:51.349
Right.

38:52.699 --> 38:55.549
Maybe you're not as alone
around here as you think, Danno.

39:03.318 --> 39:04.309
What are we watching?

39:04.950 --> 39:07.686
You getting your ass handed to
you in the state championship.

39:08.275 --> 39:09.836
Kukui put all the
old games online.

39:09.837 --> 39:12.159
You just got sacked, boss.
You should've passed.

39:12.160 --> 39:13.545
Why pass when you can run?

39:15.583 --> 39:16.233
Oh.

39:20.495 --> 39:21.957
Ah, see, now I gotta admit,

39:22.231 --> 39:24.273
that was a beautiful play.

39:24.274 --> 39:26.009
Your dad couldn't stop screaming.

39:28.296 --> 39:29.921
You were there with my dad?

39:33.795 --> 39:34.594
Yeah.

39:34.873 --> 39:36.282
I was fresh out of the academy,

39:36.283 --> 39:37.648
he was my training officer.

39:40.473 --> 39:42.036
I'll tell you, any day that

39:42.037 --> 39:43.848
Steve McGarrett was
starting at quarterback

39:43.849 --> 39:45.309
was an official day off.

39:47.232 --> 39:48.293
I just got one question:

39:48.294 --> 39:50.344
What's a quarterback
doing with the number 50?

39:52.556 --> 39:54.912
No, it's five-oh. Yeah.

39:55.499 --> 39:57.580
No, it's not, it's not 50,
it's five-oh.

39:57.581 --> 39:58.656
It's what my dad used to call

39:58.657 --> 40:00.858
our family, because we
weren't native Hawaiian,

40:00.859 --> 40:02.609
so he nicknamed us "Five-oh's"

40:02.610 --> 40:04.893
after the 50th state in the Union-
I don't know.

40:04.894 --> 40:06.212
It was his way of making us feel

40:06.735 --> 40:08.910
like we belonged someplace,
I guess.

40:11.522 --> 40:12.209
Hmm.

40:12.456 --> 40:14.105
I like that.
Five-O.
