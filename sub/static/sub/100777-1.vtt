[Paul] Relax. I got this.

25:38.666 --> 25:41.583
-[Ellie] <i>But--</i>
-[Paul] It's a date, not a book report.

25:43.708 --> 25:46.958
I got two of them signed when he came
to Powell's Books last year. [chuckles]

25:47.750 --> 25:49.375
I drove all night to get there.

25:49.916 --> 25:51.083
Oh, uh...

25:51.958 --> 25:52.791
Cool.

25:53.416 --> 25:55.250
You've probably already read it.

25:56.333 --> 25:58.791
-Thought you'd like one.
-Uh, yeah, totally.

25:58.875 --> 26:00.416
No, I-- I love, uh...

26:01.291 --> 26:02.125
Nazis.

26:04.333 --> 26:06.416
[Paul over speaker]
<i>I mean, the-- the ones in the book.</i>

26:06.500 --> 26:08.750
<i>I mean, like, more of those Nazis.</i>
<i>Am I right?</i>

26:20.541 --> 26:22.708
Uh, speaking of Nazis...

26:24.125 --> 26:25.625
thank you for meeting me here.

26:26.333 --> 26:27.500
My dad...

26:28.833 --> 26:31.000
he isn't a Nazi exactly, but, uh...

26:31.625 --> 26:32.875
he can be pretty strict.

26:33.708 --> 26:35.708
You know, people talk.

26:36.416 --> 26:38.666
Um, yeah. Talk. Ugh.

26:40.083 --> 26:41.208
[sighs]

26:46.416 --> 26:47.333
It's nice...

26:48.000 --> 26:49.458
to make a new friend, though.

26:50.416 --> 26:51.250
Oh.

26:51.458 --> 26:52.333
A friend.

26:54.583 --> 26:55.416
Good.

27:04.333 --> 27:05.583
They use Reddi-wip.

27:07.458 --> 27:08.291
Oh.

27:09.083 --> 27:10.958
It's, uh... from a can.

27:11.708 --> 27:13.416
Uh... but it's okay.

27:19.708 --> 27:21.041
[sighs heavily]

27:21.541 --> 27:22.875
[Paul] <i>It wasn't that bad.</i>

27:22.958 --> 27:26.000
What about that date wasn't bad?
You have nothing in common.

27:26.083 --> 27:27.000
Not yet, but--

27:27.083 --> 27:28.166
Game over.

27:28.250 --> 27:29.541
[Paul panting] I can't give up.

27:29.625 --> 27:32.041
[Ellie] Look, you and Aster Flores,
not gonna happen.

27:36.833 --> 27:40.250
-[boy] Chugga chugga Chu Chu!
-[Paul] Hey!

27:43.750 --> 27:46.416
-Who are you calling "Chu Chu"?
-[boy] Shit, let's get out of here!

27:46.541 --> 27:49.916
[Paul] What kind of wusses say dumb shit
and then drive away?

27:51.333 --> 27:52.500
Yeah, you'd better run!

27:55.291 --> 27:56.125
What?

27:58.541 --> 28:01.000
[Ellie] Aster Flores thinks
you're into abstract art

28:01.083 --> 28:02.708
and repressed British literature.

28:02.791 --> 28:04.375
-Yeah.
-None of that is you.

28:04.458 --> 28:07.416
It could be.<i> </i>I started reading
that <i>Remains Of The Day </i>book.

28:07.833 --> 28:10.041
-Really?
-Yeah. I fell asleep a few times,

28:10.125 --> 28:11.541
but I'm still reading it.

28:11.625 --> 28:13.291
That's gotta count for something.

28:13.750 --> 28:15.375
There are no points for effort.

28:16.666 --> 28:20.083
Isn't that what love is? How much effort
you put into loving someone?

28:20.166 --> 28:22.000
[thunder rumbles]

28:23.625 --> 28:25.083
Well, whatever love is,

28:25.166 --> 28:27.166
-we just blew it with Aster Flores.
-[phone chimes]

28:36.791 --> 28:37.708
Yes!

28:41.041 --> 28:42.166
No, I can do this.

28:43.333 --> 28:44.291
We can do this.

28:44.375 --> 28:45.875
[rain pattering on roof]

28:51.250 --> 28:52.083
Okay.

28:52.583 --> 28:53.583
I'll pay you double.

28:54.083 --> 28:55.208
You don't have to pay me.

28:55.291 --> 28:57.666
Don't be weird, dude.
Why else would you do this?

28:58.125 --> 28:59.458
No, I've got savings.

29:01.541 --> 29:03.333
[Ellie] Next date is three weeks away.

29:03.416 --> 29:05.000
-Three weeks?
-You told her you're slammed

29:05.083 --> 29:06.916
-with football training.
-I-- I did?

29:07.000 --> 29:09.208
Yes. Also, you're in a debate
on who's the better Hepburn.

29:09.291 --> 29:10.166
[Mr. Chu] Who there?

29:12.708 --> 29:14.250
[in Mandarin] Ba, did we wake you?

29:14.833 --> 29:15.875
School project.

29:16.583 --> 29:17.666
Hi, Ellie Chu's dad.

29:21.541 --> 29:24.125
We don't have time to school you
on everything Aster thinks you are,

29:24.208 --> 29:26.625
so we have to be selective.
Deep versus broad-based learning.

29:26.708 --> 29:28.083
-Huh?
<i>-</i>We spy on her,

29:28.166 --> 29:29.750
then cram you on her greatest hits.

29:29.833 --> 29:31.000
Oh, cool.

29:31.083 --> 29:32.833
-Are you ready for this?
-Yes.

29:32.916 --> 29:35.083
[hushed] Are you ready for this?

29:35.166 --> 29:36.083
Yes, sir! Yes, sir!

29:36.166 --> 29:37.000
Shh!

29:37.083 --> 29:39.416
So, in <i>No Exit,</i>
three people are trapped in hell.

29:39.500 --> 29:42.041
A door opens, but nobody leaves.

29:42.125 --> 29:44.083
[Paul]
That's nuts. He can't stand these people.

29:44.166 --> 29:45.750
A door opens and he doesn't leave?

29:45.833 --> 29:48.125
[Ellie] He's trapped in hell.
It's a metaphor for existence.

29:48.208 --> 29:50.041
[Paul] My nana hated Minnesota. She left.

29:50.125 --> 29:52.708
[Ellie] Your nana wasn't one of
the great thinkers of the 20th century.

29:52.791 --> 29:55.333
-[Paul] Nana's not trapped in hell either.
-[Ellie groans]

29:55.833 --> 29:57.625
Hey! Hey, where are you going?

30:01.708 --> 30:03.333
The hell's got into Munsky?

30:06.125 --> 30:09.750
<i>You're like some marvelous, distant,</i>
<i>well, queen, I guess.</i>

30:10.291 --> 30:11.791
<i>You're so cool and fine.</i>

30:11.875 --> 30:14.875
[Hepburn] <i>I don't want to be worshiped,</i>
<i>I want to be loved.</i>

30:14.958 --> 30:17.666
Key thing about <i>The Philadelphia Story</i>
is it's a plea for tolerance.

30:17.750 --> 30:20.250
Check this out. I'm calling it
taco sausage. Do you want a bite?

30:20.333 --> 30:21.916
No. So tolerance...

30:22.000 --> 30:24.291
Two hand foods, one great taste.

30:25.250 --> 30:26.916
Conversation is like ping-pong.

30:27.000 --> 30:28.666
I hit one and then you...

30:30.000 --> 30:30.833
What the...

30:31.625 --> 30:32.458
Oops.

30:35.166 --> 30:36.291
[crowd groans]

30:36.958 --> 30:39.041
-[screaming]
-[giggling]

30:40.125 --> 30:41.291
[crowd gasps]

30:43.333 --> 30:45.958
-[crowd groans, shrieks]
-[Aster continues giggling]

30:46.041 --> 30:48.041
[instrumental spy music playing]

31:23.833 --> 31:25.958
We're writing a profile
on the student we most admire.

31:26.041 --> 31:27.500
Oh, cool, cool.

31:27.583 --> 31:29.958
-Views on women in the workplace?
-Does Aster like lean meats?

31:30.500 --> 31:31.583
[both] What are you doing?

31:31.666 --> 31:33.791
-I'm good cop.
-Then how come you aren't smiling?

31:33.875 --> 31:36.041
I'll smile when you follow the plan
that I carefully--

31:36.125 --> 31:39.208
I'm surprised more kids
haven't asked to interview me. Huh.

31:39.291 --> 31:40.916
I'm going in.
I'm going in with my smile.

32:04.416 --> 32:06.833
[announcer]
<i>Looks like The Moose have a man open.</i>

32:07.083 --> 32:07.916
<i>Oh!</i>

32:09.416 --> 32:10.583
[Paul] You're not hungry?

32:11.375 --> 32:12.916
Not if it's not time to eat.

32:14.208 --> 32:15.208
Now that's weird.

32:21.833 --> 32:23.958
Hey, uh, can I ask you a question?

32:24.041 --> 32:25.541
I don't want to try a taco sausage.

32:28.250 --> 32:29.375
Why Squahamish?

32:30.833 --> 32:35.083
Just, like, your dad seems so unhappy here
and you also seem kind of unhappy.

32:36.041 --> 32:37.583
-I gotta go.
-No, no, no, wait.

32:37.666 --> 32:40.833
No, you're not taking this seriously.
I have a ton of work I have to do.

32:41.208 --> 32:43.333
No, just, you're so smart.
Like, too smart to, like--

32:43.416 --> 32:45.916
Waste my time trying to win you a girl
who'll never look your way?

32:46.000 --> 32:47.666
-No, it just seems weird.
-You're weird!

32:47.750 --> 32:48.583
No-- Yes.

32:49.125 --> 32:51.750
-Enjoy your happy life in Squahamish.
-No, no...

32:52.333 --> 32:56.083
The thing about <i>No Exit </i>is it's like how
what I really want is to run my own shop,

32:56.166 --> 32:59.916
with new recipes. And-- And FYI,
taco sausage is really effing good.

33:00.250 --> 33:01.458
Okay, but I'm the fourth son

33:01.541 --> 33:03.833
and my family's been making
the same sausage for 49 years

33:03.916 --> 33:06.333
and it doesn't matter
if they're going broke, or out of style,

33:06.416 --> 33:07.333
they're Nana's recipes.

33:07.416 --> 33:09.625
If Ma can't have Nana,
at least she can make her sausages.

33:09.708 --> 33:12.541
If I break away, it'll break her heart.
And it's either her heart or mine.

33:13.291 --> 33:14.333
[panting]

33:14.416 --> 33:15.375
So I stay.

33:31.625 --> 33:32.666
[Ellie scoffs]

33:34.000 --> 33:35.208
[sighs heavily]

33:40.375 --> 33:42.208
We had to go
where my dad could get a job.

33:44.291 --> 33:45.500
He studied trains?

33:46.041 --> 33:47.083
Engineering.

33:47.291 --> 33:48.333
PhD, no less.

33:49.916 --> 33:51.041
So, uh, 

33:51.291 --> 33:53.625
he became the station manager
at Squahamish.

33:53.708 --> 33:54.625
To start.

33:55.916 --> 33:58.250
The plan was to be promoted
to system engineer.

33:59.041 --> 34:00.541
Or anything engineer.

34:02.291 --> 34:04.166
Squahamish was a jumping-off point.

34:06.208 --> 34:09.000
It turns out speaking good English
trumps having a PhD.

34:10.083 --> 34:11.583
Or one from China anyway.

34:12.750 --> 34:13.875
And my dad, he--

34:13.958 --> 34:15.291
Doesn't speak very good.

34:15.833 --> 34:18.666
-He's not bad.
-I don't speak very good either.

34:21.875 --> 34:22.750
True.

34:24.541 --> 34:25.708
What's your excuse?

34:33.625 --> 34:35.375
How do you feel about pot roast?

34:37.416 --> 34:38.791
I should get back to the station.

34:38.875 --> 34:40.458
I know, but we've gotta eat.

34:43.291 --> 34:44.250
[sighs]

34:44.583 --> 34:45.625
-[engine starts]
-[boy] <i>Mom!</i>

34:45.708 --> 34:47.375
[girl] Tommy, stop friending my friends!

34:47.458 --> 34:51.000
Would you like to weigh in or are you
just gonna scream throughout the meal?

34:51.083 --> 34:52.916
I'll deal with the dog wrestling.

34:53.000 --> 34:54.708
-Mom!
-It's your fault!

34:54.791 --> 34:56.791
[overlapping shouts]

35:01.958 --> 35:03.458
[Paul] Or we could go to your place?

35:04.625 --> 35:06.500
[jaunty instrumental music plays on TV]

35:06.583 --> 35:08.625
[cutlery clinks softly]

35:20.375 --> 35:21.291
[sighs]

35:26.541 --> 35:30.083
Match energy, match strokes,
and just say one thing.

35:33.583 --> 35:34.625
Where were you born?

35:34.958 --> 35:35.833
In Squahamish.

35:36.333 --> 35:37.166
What about you?

35:37.250 --> 35:39.375
Okay. Good. That wasn't so hard.

35:40.208 --> 35:41.416
But where were you born?

35:42.208 --> 35:43.708
I don't need talking practice.

35:44.250 --> 35:47.083
It just seems
like a really short conversation.

35:52.083 --> 35:53.250
[Ellie sighs]

35:56.666 --> 35:58.583
I was born in Xuzhou, China.

36:00.166 --> 36:01.375
When did you come here?

36:03.208 --> 36:04.291
When I was five.

36:06.291 --> 36:08.875
-What do you like about Squahamish?
-Uh...

36:09.541 --> 36:11.083
I've never been anywhere else.

36:13.250 --> 36:14.083
Me neither.

[Mr. Flores]
<i>How does Satan get his message through?</i>

36:18.416 --> 36:23.541
Outside are the dogs, the sorcerers,
the immoral persons. [groans]

36:28.416 --> 36:29.958
Does he write letters?

36:31.250 --> 36:34.500
-No, he causes us to question.
-[phone vibrates]

36:34.791 --> 36:37.083
Question our lives, our path.

36:38.541 --> 36:40.083
Our very faith in God.

36:41.125 --> 36:43.708
-Satan plants the seed of doubt...
-[phone vibrates]

36:43.791 --> 36:46.708
...and, from that seed, grows sin.

36:47.625 --> 36:48.625
Sin is everywhere.

36:51.125 --> 36:54.291
We're lucky to live in a good town
like Squahamish.

36:54.916 --> 36:57.083
But the world is changing.

36:57.708 --> 37:00.208
Let us stay strong against Satan's call,

37:00.291 --> 37:05.333
lest sin creep in and destroy
the good life God has prepared for us.

37:05.416 --> 37:07.375
[school bell rings]

37:11.750 --> 37:14.666
You know what it's like to finally meet
someone your age who gets you?

37:15.250 --> 37:18.458
You know where else you can meet
people your age who get you?

37:18.541 --> 37:19.500
College.

[Paul] <i>You should send some emojis.</i>

37:23.541 --> 37:25.541
[whispers] I'm not sending her emojis.

37:25.625 --> 37:28.125
Do pineapple, owl,
caterpillar with glasses.

37:28.750 --> 37:30.000
[Ellie] What does that mean?

37:30.083 --> 37:31.458
That doesn't mean anything.

37:31.541 --> 37:33.333
[Paul]
Glasses make the caterpillar look smart.

37:34.041 --> 37:35.125
Favorite food?

37:35.208 --> 37:37.250
Braised pork over rice. Yours?

37:37.333 --> 37:38.791
[both] Taco sausage.

37:39.291 --> 37:42.708
-Does braised pork have five-spice powder?
-How do you know five-spice powder?

37:43.291 --> 37:45.166
I kind of creeped in your cabinets.

37:45.250 --> 37:46.958
I'm always looking for new spices.

37:47.708 --> 37:48.958
Giving up on the taco sausage?

37:49.041 --> 37:51.958
Oh, no way. I've been writing to the paper
in Wenatchee for months now.

37:52.041 --> 37:53.666
If I could just get the guy to taste it.

37:54.125 --> 37:56.416
-The gateway to greatness is Wenatchee.
-Yeah.

37:57.541 --> 37:58.625
Hey, you gotta try it.

37:59.291 --> 38:00.708
What do the other Munskys think?

38:01.750 --> 38:02.916
They haven't tried it.

38:10.083 --> 38:12.125
Taco sausage has a nice ring to it.

38:12.333 --> 38:13.166
Yeah, right?

38:15.875 --> 38:16.708
Hey.

38:16.791 --> 38:17.666
Yeah?

38:18.708 --> 38:20.083
What was your mom like?

38:21.875 --> 38:23.958
Young, funny, dead.

38:24.500 --> 38:25.500
No, before she died.

1:27:49.083 --> 1:27:50.958
Only for a few months, but...

1:27:51.541 --> 1:27:52.583
it sucks.

1:27:52.958 --> 1:27:54.208
[whispers] Paul.

1:27:54.291 --> 1:27:58.666
And I've been thinking about how much
it would suck to have to<i> </i>pretend to be...

1:27:59.583 --> 1:28:00.583
not you...

1:28:01.250 --> 1:28:03.083
uh... your whole life.

1:28:07.041 --> 1:28:09.333
I always thought
that there was one way to love.

1:28:10.416 --> 1:28:11.625
Uh, one right way.

1:28:12.916 --> 1:28:14.250
But there are more.

1:28:15.000 --> 1:28:17.000
Uh, so many more than I knew.

1:28:18.708 --> 1:28:19.541
And...

1:28:20.416 --> 1:28:23.083
I never want to be the guy
who stops loving someone...

1:28:24.333 --> 1:28:26.166
for loving the way that they want to love.

1:28:29.916 --> 1:28:31.583
And thank you, Paul.

1:28:33.333 --> 1:28:34.458
That was...

1:28:35.083 --> 1:28:35.916
odd.

1:28:37.458 --> 1:28:39.041
Now, let's give Trig--

1:28:39.125 --> 1:28:41.375
-[Ellie] I also have been pretending.
-[crowd gasps]

1:28:46.416 --> 1:28:48.250
I've been pretending that--

1:28:48.333 --> 1:28:52.208
Don't worry, everyone, I, uh--
I think I know where this is going. Um...

1:28:52.291 --> 1:28:56.625
Look, Ellie, I am so, so flattered, um...

1:28:56.708 --> 1:28:59.291
-but, see, you and I are never--
-You know, Trig,

1:28:59.375 --> 1:29:01.916
I have been writing your papers
for the last four years.

1:29:02.000 --> 1:29:02.875
[crowd murmurs]

1:29:02.958 --> 1:29:04.291
And if you'll forgive me...

1:29:04.916 --> 1:29:07.041
I'm just gonna rewrite you one last time.

1:29:11.250 --> 1:29:13.875
Love isn't patient and kind and humble.

1:29:15.000 --> 1:29:16.083
Love is...

1:29:16.833 --> 1:29:17.791

1:29:18.333 --> 1:29:19.375
Love is...

1:29:24.750 --> 1:29:25.916
Love is messy.

1:29:27.000 --> 1:29:31.625
And horrible and selfish and...

1:29:35.208 --> 1:29:36.125
bold.

1:29:43.375 --> 1:29:46.333
It's not finding your perfect half.
It's...

1:29:47.708 --> 1:29:48.791

1:29:49.375 --> 1:29:50.208
and...

1:29:51.166 --> 1:29:52.708
reaching and...

1:29:53.625 --> 1:29:54.583
failing.

1:29:56.291 --> 1:29:57.750
Love is...

1:30:02.666 --> 1:30:05.208
being willing to ruin
your good painting...

1:30:07.625 --> 1:30:09.166
for the chance at a great one.

1:30:19.833 --> 1:30:22.208
Is this really the boldest stroke
you can make?

1:30:27.875 --> 1:30:28.708
You.

1:30:31.750 --> 1:30:32.583
Yeah.

So I'm the good painting?

1:31:01.250 --> 1:31:04.583
Mommy wants you to know, in case
you are gay, Mommy still loves you.

1:31:04.666 --> 1:31:06.916
-I'm not gay, Mom.
-Thank God.

1:31:07.000 --> 1:31:09.458
I might want to change
our sausage recipe, though.

1:31:09.541 --> 1:31:10.750
Are you insane?

so you could be like me.

1:32:29.375 --> 1:32:31.041

Yeah?

1:33:22.833 --> 1:33:23.666
Yeah.

1:33:25.416 --> 1:33:28.083
You need four portfolio pieces
for art school, so...

1:33:28.500 --> 1:33:29.416
Art school?

1:33:30.041 --> 1:33:30.916
That's great.

1:33:32.000 --> 1:33:33.833
Yeah, well, nothing's great yet,

1:33:34.333 --> 1:33:35.333
but we'll see.

1:33:37.583 --> 1:33:38.875
What's going on with you?

1:33:40.166 --> 1:33:41.041
Well...

1:33:41.666 --> 1:33:43.625
I'm headed east to Grinnell.

1:33:44.416 --> 1:33:47.000
-I'm leaving tomorrow--
-That's great, Ellie. Take care.

1:33:48.916 --> 1:33:49.750
Aster!

1:33:52.833 --> 1:33:53.708
I'm sorry.

1:33:58.500 --> 1:33:59.375
It was just...

1:34:01.208 --> 1:34:02.833
supposed to be one letter.

1:34:05.000 --> 1:34:06.333
I never meant to hurt you.

1:34:28.041 --> 1:34:29.916
Deep down, I probably knew the truth.

1:34:32.708 --> 1:34:35.541
You really didn't use enough emojis
in his texts.

1:34:36.791 --> 1:34:38.166
I don't know what they mean.

1:34:38.250 --> 1:34:39.458
A puppy or...

1:34:40.166 --> 1:34:43.000
-a sausage--
-I should have sent you a sausage emoji?

1:34:43.875 --> 1:34:44.958
Fair point.

never crossed my mind.

You know...

1:35:00.000 --> 1:35:01.166
if things were different.

1:35:05.541 --> 1:35:06.708
Or I was different.

1:35:12.083 --> 1:35:13.541
You could never be different.

-And on, and on, and on, and on.
-And you know, you-- you watch.

1:35:27.500 --> 1:35:30.708
Okay? In a couple of years,
I am gonna be so sure.

Good luck with that.
