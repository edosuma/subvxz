01:07.800 --> 01:09.791
(Applause)

01:11.920 --> 01:14.195
Middle and leg, please, Peter.

01:14.240 --> 01:16.231
All right, towards you.

01:16.280 --> 01:18.669
Little more. Little more.

01:18.720 --> 01:20.711
I want you.

01:20.760 --> 01:22.830
And I want you now.

01:22.880 --> 01:25.075
Scintilla of a nano inch more.

01:27.280 --> 01:28.952
<i>That's middle and leg.</i>

01:29.960 --> 01:31.951
You are, you're the most...

01:32.680 --> 01:33.795
(Snores)

01:37.280 --> 01:39.077
All right, three to come.

01:39.120 --> 01:40.838
Right arm over.

01:41.600 --> 01:43.033
And, play.

01:48.480 --> 01:49.879
Howzat!

01:49.920 --> 01:52.115
Oh, that's very out, Nigel.

01:52.160 --> 01:54.549
- <i>New batsman.</i>
- Ah! I'm in.

01:54.600 --> 01:56.158
(Applause)
- <i>Well done.</i>

01:56.200 --> 01:57.349
I know.

01:57.400 --> 01:59.789
Sorry, Nigel. Should have moved your feet.

02:01.640 --> 02:03.039
No, no, no.

02:03.080 --> 02:05.275
- Um... l'm in.
- Oh!

02:07.120 --> 02:09.110
Be careful, he's quick.

02:09.160 --> 02:11.276
Bloody quick. Never saw it.

02:22.200 --> 02:24.191
OLIVIA: <i>We had a deal, Mr Pearson.</i>

02:31.120 --> 02:33.111
Leg, please, Umpire.

02:33.160 --> 02:35.071
Yeah, that's leg.

02:37.880 --> 02:39.871
Two to come, right arm over.

02:39.920 --> 02:41.638
Play.

02:44.960 --> 02:46.951
<i>Nice shot, Simon.</i>

02:47.000 --> 02:49.514
Oh, Lord, he's back.

02:49.560 --> 02:50.879
(Applause)

02:50.920 --> 02:52.717
(Chuckles)

03:01.560 --> 03:03.551
Um... I thought this was <i>my</i> office?

03:03.600 --> 03:05.591
No, I'm just seeing what we're up to.

03:07.160 --> 03:09.151
Did you just say what <i>we're</i> up to?

03:10.240 --> 03:12.470
Yeah, I'm coming back to work - as a partner.

03:13.360 --> 03:15.351
Simon, you're being prosecuted.

03:15.400 --> 03:17.197
Yes, but not yet.

03:19.600 --> 03:23.513
The SRA say it's OK to practice,
pending any proceedings. So here I am.

03:23.720 --> 03:25.915
Yes, but that isn't what they say, is it?

03:25.960 --> 03:27.871
They've laid down strict conditions.

03:27.920 --> 03:30.992
Ten of them!
Ten commandments, ten thou shalt not dos.

03:31.040 --> 03:34.555
Couldn't be clearer
if Moses brought it down from Mount Sinai.

03:34.600 --> 03:36.591
Oh, chi-lax, will you?

03:36.640 --> 03:40.155
On the door, it says "Kingdom and Kingdom".

03:40.200 --> 03:42.156
And the second one's back.

03:42.200 --> 03:44.191
No, Simon, I'm the second one.

03:44.240 --> 03:46.071
And Dad was the first.

03:46.120 --> 03:48.111
No, Dad's dead and I'm not.

03:49.120 --> 03:51.111
Well... not now anyway.

03:51.160 --> 03:52.593
Oh...

03:52.640 --> 03:54.631
I need to borrow the car.

03:54.680 --> 03:56.477
(Knock at door)

03:56.520 --> 03:57.953
Your ten o'clock's here, Peter.

03:58.000 --> 03:59.877
Morning, Louise.

03:59.920 --> 04:01.319
Louise?

04:02.920 --> 04:04.512
Chi-lax.

04:04.560 --> 04:06.551
What kind of word is "chi-lax"?

04:07.280 --> 04:09.271
Nice car, Simon.

04:09.320 --> 04:13.233
Thank you!
So, do you fancy another innings, Mrs Pearson?

04:13.920 --> 04:15.717
Simon Kingdom!

04:15.760 --> 04:17.557
(Both laugh)

04:20.640 --> 04:22.835
OLIVIA: <i>I could go out of business.</i>

04:23.480 --> 04:25.471
L5,000 is a lot of money.

04:26.080 --> 04:28.469
No, no, I'm sure, Mrs Godfrey. It's just...

04:29.400 --> 04:31.675
You gave this money to the Cricket Club?

04:31.720 --> 04:34.632
For sponsorship.
And they've reneged on the agreement.

04:34.680 --> 04:36.113
Mr Pearson promised.

04:36.160 --> 04:37.673
Nigel Pearson?

04:37.720 --> 04:39.711
Look, I won't be taken for a fool.

04:39.760 --> 04:41.751
I gave that man a cheque.

04:41.800 --> 04:45.190
My shop was to have its name on the kit
and the pavilion.

04:45.240 --> 04:47.959
Willow on leather.

04:49.040 --> 04:51.190
<i>In business terms, a perfect fit.</i>

04:51.240 --> 04:56.189
But when I turned up last Sunday, it wasn't Tiger
Lily's on the jumpers, it was Exhausts R Us.

04:56.240 --> 04:57.832
Most upsetting.

04:57.880 --> 04:59.711
What exactly is your shop?

04:59.760 --> 05:01.955
<i>Well, what do you think?</i>

05:02.000 --> 05:03.991
Naughty boy.

05:05.640 --> 05:08.916
You see, Lyle, scratch the surface
of Market Shipborough

05:08.960 --> 05:12.475
and you will expose
sedimentary layers of legal complexity.

05:12.520 --> 05:17.674
Where else would you find a woman's hopes
dashed by a tyre and exhaust centre?

05:17.720 --> 05:19.995
But what exactly does she sell?

05:20.040 --> 05:21.837
Use your imagination.

05:21.880 --> 05:24.075
GLORIA: (Groans) <i>Oh, Peter!</i>

05:24.120 --> 05:27.317
Have you been playing
Warrior God Slayers again? It's crashed.

05:27.360 --> 05:29.351
I haven't touched it, I swear to you.

05:34.040 --> 05:36.031
Er... Mr Snell, are you all right?

05:36.080 --> 05:37.513
Sidney, what happened?

05:39.240 --> 05:43.995
I wonder, Mr Kingdom, if I might have
a word with you of a private nature?

05:44.040 --> 05:46.315
Right. Well, let's go to the garden.

05:49.440 --> 05:51.271
Arrh!

05:51.320 --> 05:53.914
Well, no wonder you found it difficult to walk.

05:55.080 --> 05:57.071
They sent two of them.

05:57.120 --> 05:58.712
Did they?

05:58.760 --> 06:00.751
And um... what exactly is this?

06:00.800 --> 06:02.791
Well...

06:02.840 --> 06:04.831
it's a Nordic ski trainer.

06:06.080 --> 06:07.479
It's for Gloria.

06:07.520 --> 06:09.238
You know, birthday present.

06:09.280 --> 06:11.271
So you and she really are?

06:12.640 --> 06:14.232
Whatever. That doesn't matter.

06:14.280 --> 06:18.353
The thing is...
I can't give it to her if I can't erect it.

06:18.400 --> 06:20.356
Well, quite.

06:20.400 --> 06:23.472
I bought it off the internet -
NorwegianDelights. Com.

06:23.520 --> 06:27.354
But I'm getting nowhere complaining
and they won't give me my money back.

06:27.400 --> 06:31.279
Mr Kingdom, I want you to make them eat dirt!

06:32.760 --> 06:35.149
This is really important to me, Mr Kingdom.

06:35.200 --> 06:36.394
Hmm?

06:36.440 --> 06:38.476
So, er... not a word.

06:38.520 --> 06:40.909
No, no, no, no. My lips are sealed, Mr Snell.

06:40.960 --> 06:41.949
<i>Peter.</i>

06:42.000 --> 06:45.595
Exhausts R Us also did their sponsorship deal
with Nigel Pearson.

06:45.640 --> 06:47.915
Oh, they did, did they?

06:48.960 --> 06:50.951
You leave this with me, Mr Snell.

06:51.000 --> 06:52.991
Right, come on, let's go.

07:01.720 --> 07:04.029
If you just hold that for about 30 seconds.

07:06.280 --> 07:09.590
So, yes, the sponsorship.
Well, it was all looking very promising.

07:09.640 --> 07:13.189
Mrs Godfrey was very generous,
so we did the printing.

07:13.240 --> 07:17.472
But the team threw a wobbly
and downright refused to wear the kit.

07:17.520 --> 07:19.511
What was wrong with it?

07:22.680 --> 07:26.468
See, I thought it was all right,
cos the motto was in Latin.

07:27.360 --> 07:32.434
"Coito, ergo sum."
"I make love, therefore I am." How original.

07:32.480 --> 07:35.711
But I think it was the logo that did the damage.

07:35.760 --> 07:37.751
(Mobile rings)
- <i>Oh, my Lord!</i>

07:40.400 --> 07:42.994
- Hello?
- That's for the children's home.

07:43.480 --> 07:44.913
- Ow!
- <i>Lyle!</i>

07:52.360 --> 07:54.112
Well, you've got my vote.

07:54.800 --> 07:58.110
A fellow warrior!
Would you mind helping me a moment?

07:58.160 --> 08:00.913
- Certainly.
- Thanks so much.

08:01.880 --> 08:04.075
- Just hold that.
- OK.

08:05.000 --> 08:07.673
Now, can you put that through there?

08:07.720 --> 08:09.711
- No problem.
- And click it.

08:10.440 --> 08:11.270
Thanks.

08:11.320 --> 08:15.711
- But now you're attached...
- Recycle plastics, or we won't pay our taxes!

08:16.400 --> 08:19.915
Recycle plastics, or we won't pay our taxes!

08:19.960 --> 08:21.757
She's nothing to do with me.

08:28.320 --> 08:31.949
I'm surprised Peter hasn't palmed
Henny off on you before.

08:32.000 --> 08:36.471
She's a bit of a nutter. We always like
to give her the same cell. Keeps her quiet.

08:36.520 --> 08:38.476
(Banging) Police brutality!

08:38.520 --> 08:40.510
Yeah! Hello, Henny.

08:41.320 --> 08:46.348
Now, if people want to chain themselves up
in their own home, that is their own affair.

08:46.400 --> 08:51.315
But a bit of light bondage is a world away
from chaining yourself to the council railings.

08:51.360 --> 08:53.999
(Banging)
- Human rights!

08:54.040 --> 08:55.871
<i>Yes, dear. Yes.</i>

08:55.920 --> 08:58.912
One witness said she had an accomplice.

09:02.640 --> 09:03.834
All yours.

09:06.840 --> 09:08.558
My hero!

09:14.200 --> 09:15.394
(Chuckles)

09:15.440 --> 09:20.639
I'll contact the council and the courts on your
behalf- try to negotiate a way through this.

09:20.680 --> 09:24.309
In the meantime, no chaining yourself
to railings. Is that clear?

09:24.360 --> 09:27.432
- But the protest must go on.
- Oh, of course.

09:27.480 --> 09:29.471
But a little less obviously.

09:30.440 --> 09:33.955
What's the point of civil action,
if nobody knows you're taking it?

09:34.000 --> 09:36.992
There must be ways.
Gandhi had some pretty good ideas.

09:37.800 --> 09:39.028
Gandhi?

09:40.080 --> 09:43.629
Of course. He walked across India.
I could walk across...

09:43.680 --> 09:47.036
No. You can't walk anywhere.
You can't leave the area.

09:47.080 --> 09:50.197
- Silent protest outside the council?
- Obstruction.

09:50.240 --> 09:52.037
- Leaflets?
- Litter.

09:52.080 --> 09:54.719
- I could live in a tree.
- Wildlife bylaws.

09:57.080 --> 10:00.550
If I were you, I'd just stay at home.
Put your feet up.

10:01.360 --> 10:03.112
(Chuckles)

10:05.120 --> 10:06.792
All right.

10:06.840 --> 10:09.308
Now, click on History.

10:09.360 --> 10:11.590
Let's see what caused your hiccup.

10:12.400 --> 10:16.075
NorwegianDelights. Com? Oh, Peter!

10:16.120 --> 10:18.156
What? I haven't touched your machine.

10:18.200 --> 10:21.636
Why would you assume that something
called NorwegianDelights. Com

10:21.680 --> 10:23.477
is a euphemism for pornography?

10:23.520 --> 10:25.511
Well, what else could it be? Herrings?

10:25.560 --> 10:27.630
<i>Just take my word for it. All right?</i>

10:31.800 --> 10:34.439
Eccentric and completely barking she might be...

10:34.480 --> 10:37.836
but at least Henny believes in
something - views which I share.

10:37.880 --> 10:43.238
Don't get yourself chained to anything. The Law
Society takes a dim view of solicitors in cells.

10:43.280 --> 10:46.829
Speaking of which, I want you to baby-sit Simon
for me - in the legal capacity.

10:46.880 --> 10:50.429
Be my ears and eyes. Make sure
he doesn't get up to anything he shouldn't.

10:50.480 --> 10:53.199
(Laughs) Come here, you!

10:53.240 --> 10:55.037
(Laughing)

10:55.880 --> 10:57.199
Ohh!

10:57.240 --> 10:58.195
Mwah!

11:00.840 --> 11:02.637
Catch me if you can!

11:02.680 --> 11:06.673
<i>I'm gonna catch you, Mrs Pearson!</i>

11:06.720 --> 11:09.917
- <i>Ooh, Simon! Can't you wait?</i>
- <i>No, I can't.</i>

11:09.960 --> 11:12.758
- And here we are.
- Er...

11:14.720 --> 11:17.109
Well, come along, for goodness' sake.

11:20.160 --> 11:22.196
Nothing to be embarrassed about.

11:22.800 --> 11:24.233
Someone might see me.

11:24.280 --> 11:25.872
<i>Good morning.</i>

11:25.920 --> 11:29.435
Mr Kingdom. So good to see you again.
What's the news?

11:29.480 --> 11:33.996
Well, I'm afraid the players refuse to wear the kit,
Olivia.

11:34.040 --> 11:35.439
The logo.

11:35.480 --> 11:36.993
What's wrong with it?

11:37.040 --> 11:40.794
Well, you have to admit that any bee
looking for pollen in that lily logo

11:40.840 --> 11:42.831
is in for a nasty shock.

11:43.680 --> 11:46.592
I'm sorry, Olivia,
but... have you looked at what you sell?

11:46.640 --> 11:48.198
Don't be such a prude.

11:48.240 --> 11:50.993
I'm not. I'm just saying that,
on the appropriate scale,

11:51.040 --> 11:54.316
a sex shop sponsoring a cricket team
is minus six out of ten.

11:54.360 --> 11:59.309
It doesn't matter whether it's a sex shop or
a greengrocer. It makes no difference in law.

11:59.360 --> 12:04.195
The contract was signed and executed by
Nigel Pearson himself on behalf of the club.

12:05.080 --> 12:07.833
Lyle... put it down.

12:08.600 --> 12:10.192
Sorry.

12:11.440 --> 12:13.431
Oh, good God! Get off.

12:14.120 --> 12:16.315
(Air hissing)

12:16.360 --> 12:17.509
Sorry...

12:18.560 --> 12:20.551
Leave the goods alone, Lyle.

12:28.480 --> 12:30.471
ROSIE: Oh, thanks for a brilliant time.

12:31.920 --> 12:34.115
Same time next week?

12:34.160 --> 12:36.151
Wild horses wouldn't stop me.

12:36.960 --> 12:38.678
Mwah!

12:38.720 --> 12:40.995
Send my love to your husband. (Chuckles)

12:44.080 --> 12:45.513
<i>See you!</i>

12:47.040 --> 12:50.271
Nigel! I'm home!

12:51.240 --> 12:52.912
<i>Have you missed me?</i>

12:52.960 --> 12:54.439
(Groans)

12:55.480 --> 12:57.471
Mwah!

13:07.080 --> 13:09.071
What on earth?

13:11.320 --> 13:13.197
(Phone rings)

13:14.120 --> 13:17.749
- Lyle Anderson.
- Lyle? Oh, thank goodness.

13:17.800 --> 13:20.268
Listen. I've been burgled.

13:20.320 --> 13:22.993
Burgled? What have they taken?

13:23.040 --> 13:25.031
Everything, Lyle.

13:25.080 --> 13:27.071
Except the phone.

13:30.200 --> 13:34.034
- So, what do you think?
- Yes, it's very...

13:34.080 --> 13:35.911
It's very...

13:35.960 --> 13:38.349
Do you know, I don't think there's a word for it?

13:39.360 --> 13:41.396
All that's really missing are clients.

13:41.440 --> 13:43.476
What about my old clients?

13:43.520 --> 13:47.149
Yes, I had to take them on, after you...
went swimming.

13:47.200 --> 13:51.239
I've built up a relationship with them.
They trust me. I trust them.

13:51.280 --> 13:54.397
But you trust everybody. That's your problem.

13:55.560 --> 13:58.836
Peter, Henny Leach... has been burgled.

13:59.920 --> 14:02.992
Henny? Are you sure
it's not one of her cries for help?

14:03.040 --> 14:05.110
Oh. I'll tell you what.

14:05.160 --> 14:08.755
Why don't you introduce her to Simon?

14:11.600 --> 14:13.238
Love to.

14:14.280 --> 14:17.636
Lyle, so good you're here. Erm... who's this?

14:17.680 --> 14:19.750
Simon Kingdom.

14:19.800 --> 14:21.791
Lyle works for us.

14:24.640 --> 14:27.677
Well, I just came back and found this.

14:28.400 --> 14:30.755
- Good Lord.
- It's everything.

14:30.800 --> 14:34.315
My campaign literature,
all the research documents.

14:34.360 --> 14:38.672
And my scrapbook...
with all my court appearances.

14:39.400 --> 14:43.154
- I presume you've informed the...
- The police, Mr Kingdom?

14:43.200 --> 14:45.031
Yes, Mr Anderson did.

14:45.080 --> 14:49.551
Some people are more willing to work with
the police than others, if you get my meaning.

14:49.600 --> 14:53.036
Still, I'm glad to see
you're in gainful employment.

14:53.680 --> 14:56.911
Like you said, they've really turned her over.

14:57.800 --> 14:59.472
Professional job.

14:59.520 --> 15:01.988
<i>No sign of forced entry.</i>

15:02.040 --> 15:05.430
Somehow, they managed to get in
through that tiny little window.

15:05.480 --> 15:08.392
You will go easy when you catch them,
won't you?

15:08.440 --> 15:11.876
I mean, they probably come from
a deprived background,

15:11.920 --> 15:15.276
and they have no choice
but to resort to a life of crime.

15:15.320 --> 15:18.551
Ms Leach... you're the victim here.

15:19.360 --> 15:24.070
The people that did this -
they don't have any more rights than you do.

15:24.120 --> 15:25.951
So, what should she do?

15:26.800 --> 15:28.438
What?

15:28.480 --> 15:32.029
Advice to client.
I mean, you are one of the partners.

15:33.840 --> 15:35.796
Ooh...

15:38.000 --> 15:40.878
Er... it's a tricky one. Erm...

15:40.920 --> 15:42.592
I think he's trying to say that,

15:42.640 --> 15:45.871
because you left your window open,
your insurance might not cover you.

15:46.640 --> 15:49.791
That is what you were trying to say, isn't it,
Mr Kingdom?

15:50.520 --> 15:53.592
- Yeah.
- But I don't have insurance.

15:53.640 --> 15:55.631
I just don't believe in it.

15:56.800 --> 16:00.270
(Phone rings)
- <i>Hello. Nigel Pearson.</i>

16:00.320 --> 16:03.630
<i>Yes, Nigel. Peter Kingdom.</i>
<i>Have you got a moment?</i>

16:03.680 --> 16:06.035
Ah, Peter. Yes.

16:06.080 --> 16:09.914
Er... not a good time.
I'll have to come back to you.

16:09.960 --> 16:12.190
OK. Bye. (Sighs)

16:12.240 --> 16:14.595
Right. Who's for crazy golf, then?

16:14.640 --> 16:16.119
(Cheering)

16:16.160 --> 16:19.118
Something is just not right here.

16:20.360 --> 16:24.035
Yet another member of the cricket
team says he never even saw the kit.

16:24.080 --> 16:27.436
I can't understand why Nigel Pearson would lie.

16:27.480 --> 16:29.038
He's not that kind of man.

16:29.080 --> 16:32.277
Have you any idea
how much he does for this town?

16:32.320 --> 16:37.075
Look, I have a contract. He came to me,
I said yes, I gave him the money.

16:37.120 --> 16:40.078
I'm not the grubby one in this relationship.

16:40.120 --> 16:44.511
Right. I need every single detail.
How did you meet?

16:44.560 --> 16:47.791
Customer.
He was in buying something for his wife.

16:47.840 --> 16:50.798
What was it, now? Spanking paddle, I think.

16:53.000 --> 16:55.958
- Ah, just the man.
- Oh, Mr Kingdom.

16:56.000 --> 16:59.629
Have you been coming into our office
and crashing Gloria's computer?

16:59.680 --> 17:01.238
Yeah, that was me.

17:01.280 --> 17:04.875
Well, thanks to you, I'm being blamed
as a user of internet pornography.

17:05.680 --> 17:07.238
Which you're not?

17:07.280 --> 17:11.114
Certainly not.
Look, I think we may have a problem.

17:11.160 --> 17:13.878
Norwegian Delights is based in Trondheim.

17:13.920 --> 17:16.150
You are based in Market Shipborough.

17:16.200 --> 17:19.157
So, what am I gonna get Gloria
for her birthday present?

17:19.200 --> 17:21.873
- Chocolates. Flowers.
- Well, it's...

17:22.560 --> 17:24.117
Wheelbarrow.

17:24.160 --> 17:27.709
Not quite as romantic, perhaps, but if you...

17:28.720 --> 17:31.871
Hang on. Nigel? Nigel!

17:33.520 --> 17:35.192
(Chuckles)

17:38.640 --> 17:40.949
I can come back when you're less busy.

17:41.000 --> 17:42.991
Oh, yeah. Very amusing. What is it?

17:43.040 --> 17:44.871
The council returned my calls.

17:44.920 --> 17:48.196
They've got a court order against Henny
for non-payment of council tax.

17:48.240 --> 17:50.071
The bailiffs have been instructed.

17:50.120 --> 17:52.588
But they won't get much. She's been burgled.

17:52.640 --> 17:54.517
Are you being this thick on purpose?

17:54.560 --> 17:57.996
She hasn't been burgled.
The bailiffs have cleaned her out.

18:04.840 --> 18:09.231
I took you at your word. Even though you're a
defendant in this possible action, I trusted you.

18:09.280 --> 18:11.430
Simon wasn't there when I showed them the kit.

18:11.480 --> 18:13.789
I've had so much trouble with the committee
over it.

18:13.840 --> 18:16.354
Morning, Isabel. Hello, Sophie, Georgia.

18:16.400 --> 18:18.391
- Apple?
- Thank you.

18:19.960 --> 18:24.829
All my client wants is what you and she agreed:
To sponsor the team.

18:24.880 --> 18:28.759
Look, I'll sort this out.
I'm on the cusp of a breakthrough.

18:28.800 --> 18:32.429
Wear the Tiger Lily sweaters
or give back the money.

18:32.480 --> 18:36.996
The best thing is: You back off. Leave it to me.
I'll sort it. You know me.

18:37.040 --> 18:40.635
- Here's an apple for you.
- For me? Thank you very much.

18:41.640 --> 18:43.358
How kind.

18:45.520 --> 18:47.511
Melts your heart, doesn't it?

18:49.080 --> 18:51.958
Cut the clever-bugger stuff
and brief me on the law again.

18:52.000 --> 18:54.434
- You don't know it?
- Well, I did know it, but...

18:54.480 --> 18:56.357
right now I can't recall it.

18:56.400 --> 18:59.392
I thought you weren't supposed to
work on financial cases.

18:59.440 --> 19:01.635
Oh, God, you sound just like my brother.

19:01.680 --> 19:04.433
Tell me the law, or I'll twist your ears. All right?

19:11.640 --> 19:14.916
It rather reminds me of those
university library sit-ins.

19:16.280 --> 19:21.035
Yeah, well, we've looked into this,
Henny, and the upshot is

19:21.080 --> 19:25.517
that your goods and chattels were removed
by the bailiffs to repay your council tax.

19:25.560 --> 19:27.676
Well, they don't have the right, do they?

19:27.720 --> 19:30.314
Yes. If you'd paid,
they wouldn't have taken your stuff.

19:30.360 --> 19:33.750
But I thought we were conscientious objectors.

19:33.800 --> 19:36.837
In spirit. Still, bailiffs have to abide by the law.

19:36.880 --> 19:40.111
They can't just swan into your property
and take your things...

19:40.160 --> 19:43.197
Did they give you seven days' notice?

19:43.240 --> 19:44.229
No.

19:44.280 --> 19:47.352
They have to give you
seven working days' notice.

19:47.400 --> 19:50.790
- Actually, that's not quite right.
- What do you mean?

19:50.840 --> 19:53.149
<i>Bailiffs can enter without giving any notice.</i>

19:53.200 --> 19:56.237
If you open the door to them,
or leave a door or window open,

19:56.280 --> 19:58.794
they can come into your house
and seize your goods.

19:58.840 --> 20:01.035
Without the seven working days' notice?

20:01.080 --> 20:03.833
Yeah. I don't know where you got that from.

20:03.880 --> 20:06.838
But what worries me is how they got
in through that tiny window.

20:06.880 --> 20:09.235
(Door bell)
- Oh, excuse me.

20:12.960 --> 20:15.599
- Aaaarghh!
- How kind of you...

20:15.640 --> 20:18.438
to humiliate me in front of a client!

20:19.280 --> 20:22.989
Any time. Yeah. Don't mention it.
Oh, and about your bag...

20:23.040 --> 20:25.270
- Ah, finally.
- You want to be more careful.

20:25.320 --> 20:29.199
Especially with that sort of cash.
It's in an even safer place now.

20:29.240 --> 20:34.234
Mr Kingdom... this is my next-door neighbour.

20:34.280 --> 20:39.274
She feeds my cats for me
when I'm on remand or away doing time.

20:39.320 --> 20:43.632
She says she let two very nice gentlemen in
from the electricity board.

20:45.440 --> 20:47.431
I'm gonna need a screwdriver.

20:48.160 --> 20:50.037
Oh.

21:03.120 --> 21:06.749
I'm completely appalled.
It's offensive - that's what it is.

21:06.800 --> 21:11.396
Too right. It's that Peter Kingdom making us
wear you-know-whats on our cricket jumpers.

21:13.200 --> 21:15.475
No offence, but your brother is a complete arse.

21:15.520 --> 21:17.636
Oh, none taken, I assure you.

21:17.680 --> 21:21.912
You see, you and I are part of a dying breed,
an endangered species.

21:21.960 --> 21:24.076
Solicitorus Care-A-Lottus.

21:24.120 --> 21:29.114
You've got a lot of bottle, showing your face
around here - at least until the anger subsides.

21:29.160 --> 21:30.479
What anger?

21:30.520 --> 21:33.080
Forcing them to be sponsored by a sex shop.

21:33.120 --> 21:37.432
No, that's complete nonsense. It was
Nigel Pearson who signed that contract.

21:37.480 --> 21:39.516
Oh, that's not how he's been telling it.

21:40.200 --> 21:43.033
What do you think we are? Perverts?

21:43.080 --> 21:46.038
Don't you ever come and umpire here again.

21:47.200 --> 21:49.191
Told you they were angry.

22:00.440 --> 22:02.431
Oh...

22:02.480 --> 22:04.471
(Bottles clinking)

22:12.400 --> 22:13.913
(Banging)

22:13.960 --> 22:15.951
Nigel!

22:19.560 --> 22:21.551
I know you're in there, Nigel!

22:25.920 --> 22:29.799
Right. I'm going to count to six.

22:29.840 --> 22:33.230
And if you haven't opened the door,
I'm going to sue you for slander.

22:34.040 --> 22:36.429
<i>One,</i>

22:36.480 --> 22:37.913
<i>two,</i>

22:37.960 --> 22:41.191
three, four...

22:41.240 --> 22:45.028
Two left in the over. Five...

22:45.080 --> 22:47.196
- (Groans)
- <i>And...</i>

22:47.600 --> 22:50.512
So, I'm making them wear phallic jumpers, am I?

22:50.560 --> 22:52.630
They probably got the wrong end of the stick.

22:52.680 --> 22:57.834
Thanks to you, the club thinks
I'm some sort of sex-obsessed dildo-phile.

22:57.880 --> 23:01.555
It's nothing to do with me, Nigel.
You are the one who signed the contract.

23:01.600 --> 23:04.592
And you are the one who's obliged to
keep his end of the bargain.

23:04.640 --> 23:06.596
I will. The club will.

23:06.640 --> 23:10.553
You've already cashed Olivia's cheque
for L5,000.

23:10.600 --> 23:13.558
But the printing's already been done.
I don't know what to do.

23:13.600 --> 23:17.957
Either the club honours its deal,
or we come after you for the money.

23:22.200 --> 23:24.191
You've got 24 hours.

23:28.400 --> 23:30.391
(Tyres squealing)

23:32.920 --> 23:35.832
Doesn't look very welcoming.

23:35.880 --> 23:37.677
No, I...

23:37.720 --> 23:41.838
Yeah, all right. Look, I've got to go.
That nutter's back.

23:44.440 --> 23:46.829
Actually, I'm glad you're here.

23:47.840 --> 23:50.434
Saves us the bother of posting the bill.

23:52.120 --> 23:56.511
This must be the fifth time we've
repossessed your property.

23:56.560 --> 24:00.394
- Why are you posting it to her?
- She's liable for the costs.

24:00.440 --> 24:03.955
What? Your costs are meant to be
fair and reasonable.

24:04.000 --> 24:08.152
Well, it's inflation. That's how much it costs
to recover property these days.

24:08.200 --> 24:11.749
Yes, well, we heard you said you
were from the electricity board.

24:11.800 --> 24:15.395
No. We got in through an open window.
All perfectly legal.

24:15.480 --> 24:19.029
Then would you mind showing me
who gained entry through this window?

24:20.000 --> 24:22.958
- Jason?
- <i>Yeah? What?</i>

24:30.120 --> 24:33.192
- Run that by me again.
- He's put on a few pounds.

24:33.880 --> 24:36.269
Illegal entry. Illegal removal of property.

24:36.320 --> 24:38.788
<i>I want it back, and I want it back now.</i>

24:38.840 --> 24:41.638
You can't take advantage of
vulnerable people like that.

24:45.480 --> 24:47.471
Simon?

24:55.680 --> 24:57.671
<i>(Laughter)</i>

25:01.040 --> 25:03.031
Oh, Simon...

25:12.160 --> 25:16.392
Well, I don't understand. Nigel Pearson's
such a nice man. We couldn't do without him.

25:16.440 --> 25:18.556
- Well...
- How are you and Simon getting on?

25:18.600 --> 25:21.433
Well, he's spending a lot of time
with other people's wives.

25:21.480 --> 25:23.357
Says he wants to put down roots.

25:23.400 --> 25:25.868
He had roots. He tore them up.

25:26.640 --> 25:29.950
Simon's problem is that he's so believable.

25:30.000 --> 25:32.514
Even he believes the lies he tells.

25:33.760 --> 25:37.673
Well, don't be too hard on him. It wasn't
so long ago we were mourning his passing.

25:37.720 --> 25:41.395
And now he's back,
I hear he's the life and soul of the cricket club.

25:41.440 --> 25:46.275
And you are Market Shipborough's
very own pornographer in chief.

25:46.320 --> 25:52.429
That is a complete lie. I only ever go into
that sex shop for professional reasons.

25:54.480 --> 25:56.755
As a lawyer. What's this?

25:56.800 --> 25:59.758
A shopping list for Tiger Lily's,
from the residents.

25:59.800 --> 26:02.075
Sex is not just the preserve of the young.

26:03.120 --> 26:07.318
And... what exactly is
a "human chocolate sundae"?

26:07.360 --> 26:09.874
Oh, that's Mr Butler's. It comes in a box.

26:09.920 --> 26:15.313
One sheet of polythene, a quart of chocolate
sauce, a quart of ice cream and a cherry.

26:15.360 --> 26:17.510
- Oh, just the one cherry?
- Yes.

26:17.560 --> 26:19.551
Heaven knows where you put it.

26:21.440 --> 26:24.637
Olivia? It's Peter Kingdom.

26:24.680 --> 26:26.671
Oh, actually, I'm right outside.

26:27.960 --> 26:30.952
Yeah, do you mind if I don't?
People have been talking.

26:36.320 --> 26:41.235
Well, if he doesn't come up with
a solution or your money...

26:41.280 --> 26:43.396
we're going to have to go after him.

26:43.440 --> 26:44.873
We need your permission.

26:44.920 --> 26:47.150
Do it. Don't hesitate.

26:47.840 --> 26:53.073
Yeah, but if you go after Nigel Pearson,
you're in danger of becoming a social pariah.

26:53.120 --> 26:57.193
I run a sex shop, Mr Kingdom.
I'm already a social pariah.

26:57.760 --> 26:59.478
It makes me laugh.

26:59.520 --> 27:03.035
I've a good profit going here,
so someone's buying my stuff.

27:03.080 --> 27:06.231
But they're all so prudish.

27:06.280 --> 27:08.396
What is it I do that's so wrong?

27:08.440 --> 27:12.035
I improve people's sexual relationships,
keep their marriages together.

27:12.080 --> 27:13.479
What's wrong with that?

27:13.520 --> 27:15.875
You divorce people, but they don't hate you.

27:15.920 --> 27:19.708
Oh, I don't know. I'm not exactly
flavour of the month at the moment.

27:19.760 --> 27:23.594
You want a pudding?
Special of the day: Chocolate sundae.

27:23.640 --> 27:25.835
Oh, that reminds me.

27:26.680 --> 27:28.750
Aunt Auriel's shopping list.

27:29.320 --> 27:31.470
That can't be right. Advokat.

27:31.520 --> 27:34.796
Yeah. Lawyer in Market Shipborough.

27:34.840 --> 27:36.990
Er...

27:37.040 --> 27:38.676
Snakker ikke Norsk.

27:38.760 --> 27:41.354
How do you say, "I want to sue your bottom off"
in Norwegian?

27:41.400 --> 27:43.356
Give it here.

27:43.400 --> 27:45.391
Ja har.

27:46.160 --> 27:48.151
(Speaks Norwegian)

27:49.360 --> 27:51.920
(Norwegian)

27:51.960 --> 27:55.430
(Speaks Norwegian)

27:55.480 --> 27:57.471
(Norwegian)

27:58.040 --> 28:01.874
<i>Ja. Ja. Ja.</i>

28:04.300 --> 28:08.054
New ski-trainer tonight.
I've accepted their offer of compensation.

28:08.100 --> 28:09.215
But...

28:09.260 --> 28:11.728
I spent a few months out in the fjords...

28:12.540 --> 28:15.691
trying to work out if it was a good idea to...

28:15.740 --> 28:17.412
kill myself.

28:18.140 --> 28:20.779
Anyway, can I borrow the car again?

28:21.420 --> 28:22.773
Of course. Yes.

28:23.940 --> 28:25.612
Great. Thank you. Cheers.

28:29.060 --> 28:30.652
<i>I've been so selfish.</i>

28:31.500 --> 28:35.732
All I've ever done is look on his
disappearance from my perspective -

28:35.780 --> 28:37.452
being left high and dry.

28:37.500 --> 28:40.617
It never occurred to me
that he'd been suffering too.

28:40.660 --> 28:43.618
- Was he?
- Well, of course he was.

28:43.660 --> 28:45.013
How do you know?

28:46.700 --> 28:48.452
Do you think he's lying to me?

28:49.300 --> 28:52.770
Simon's never known
where the truth ends and fantasy begins.

28:54.900 --> 28:57.858
You're not the selfish one, Peter. He is.

29:00.260 --> 29:02.854
SIMON: Mrs Pearson, that's not the gear stick!

29:02.900 --> 29:06.859
ROSIE: Let's go and play at the beach.
I've got some new toys!

29:06.900 --> 29:10.017
Excellent! (Laughs) Bring it on!

29:10.060 --> 29:12.654
- <i>One for you.</i>
(Slap)

29:12.700 --> 29:15.897
- <i>Ow!</i>
- <i>And one for me.</i>

29:17.340 --> 29:19.490
(Laughing)

29:22.500 --> 29:25.139
Ah. Did you find the postbox?

29:25.180 --> 29:26.659
Yeah.

29:28.940 --> 29:31.613
Is that all I do? Take the post?

29:32.620 --> 29:34.497
Well, we've all got to start somewhere.

29:34.540 --> 29:38.533
This is meant to be work experience. How am
I going to be a barrister by posting letters?

29:38.580 --> 29:40.013
But you're a great help.

29:40.060 --> 29:42.255
I'm only doing this cos she forced me to.

29:42.300 --> 29:44.495
And she banned me from playing cricket -

29:44.540 --> 29:46.451
even though I captain the school team.

29:46.500 --> 29:48.491
<i>She's so annoying.</i>

29:48.540 --> 29:51.930
She's your mother.
She's supposed to be annoying.

29:51.980 --> 29:54.619
Tell you what. Here's the deal.

29:55.980 --> 29:59.495
But you have to promise me
to behave like a normal child.

29:59.540 --> 30:00.973
What's in it for me?

30:04.660 --> 30:05.649
There.

30:07.620 --> 30:09.099
My grandfather's.

30:10.100 --> 30:12.409
- Make sure the top two are weighed.
- All right.

30:12.460 --> 30:14.451
And get the receipt, will you?

30:16.140 --> 30:19.291
Oh, dear. I don't want to upset Scott,

30:19.340 --> 30:22.537
but I was hoping Sidney might do
something for my birthday.

30:22.580 --> 30:26.016
- Well, he might.
- No. He hasn't shown any interest.

30:26.060 --> 30:28.051
Well, there's still time.

30:28.860 --> 30:31.499
Harry, how are things
in the fish-and-chip business?

30:31.540 --> 30:35.419
Things could be better, Peter.
Somebody's done me out of some money.

30:35.460 --> 30:37.451
I sponsored the cricket team.

30:47.100 --> 30:50.888
- Same again, please, Ted.
- I don't think you should, Nigel.

30:52.020 --> 30:54.409
Don't tell me what to do.

30:54.460 --> 30:56.530
It's best you make your way home.

31:11.980 --> 31:14.016
I need your bike.

31:14.060 --> 31:17.575
Nigel Pearson's got a lot of explaining to do.

31:19.740 --> 31:22.971
Treating me like... dirt.

31:23.860 --> 31:24.849
Cow.

31:40.620 --> 31:41.735
Look out!

31:45.300 --> 31:47.609
(Groans)

31:47.660 --> 31:49.651
Oh, my God!

31:52.820 --> 31:55.095
<i>Ambulance. I think I've killed someone.</i>

32:03.660 --> 32:06.094
- How is he?
- Not good.

32:06.140 --> 32:09.416
He just stepped off the pavement.
There was nothing I could do.

32:09.460 --> 32:11.849
Oh, no. With the injuries you gave him, he's fine.

32:11.900 --> 32:14.175
They're discharging him later this morning.

32:14.220 --> 32:16.859
No, he hasn't stopped crying about his wife.

32:16.900 --> 32:19.289
It's terrible, isn't it?

32:20.860 --> 32:23.249
He's such a nice bloke.

32:28.460 --> 32:31.179
Please, Rosie.

32:31.220 --> 32:34.292
Please take it. I bought it for you.

32:34.940 --> 32:37.852
I don't want your stupid necklace!

32:40.460 --> 32:42.451
I'm going. I'm leaving.

32:44.020 --> 32:46.614
Simon! Oh, Peter.

32:46.660 --> 32:47.979
Is he in?

32:48.620 --> 32:50.929
Nigel, it's the man who nearly killed you.

32:50.980 --> 32:53.369
And keep the noise down. I've got a headache.

32:57.380 --> 33:00.816
- I'm so sorry.
- No. It was my fault.

33:00.860 --> 33:02.771
I didn't look where I was going.

33:02.820 --> 33:07.211
From where I was, it looked as if you
deliberately walked into the traffic.

33:07.260 --> 33:10.775
Can I come and see you,
sort this whole business out?

33:10.820 --> 33:12.890
Well, in your own time, when you're ready.

33:12.940 --> 33:15.090
No - now.

33:15.140 --> 33:17.335
My 24 hours is up.

33:21.340 --> 33:23.331
I don't know what to do.

33:23.980 --> 33:25.971
I stole.

33:26.900 --> 33:30.097
I'm a thief. I'm in terrible debt. Big, big debt.

33:31.580 --> 33:33.855
Hi. You wanted me?

33:33.900 --> 33:35.777
Oh...

33:35.820 --> 33:37.811
Erm... Nigel.

33:38.540 --> 33:41.816
Nigel's been falsely promising
sponsorships to businesses

33:41.860 --> 33:43.851
all over Market Shipborough.

33:45.780 --> 33:47.452
I've conned people.

33:47.500 --> 33:50.458
I don't think I'll ever be able to
look them in the eye again.

33:51.100 --> 33:56.811
But presumably, the emotional strain
you've been under, because of your...

33:56.860 --> 33:58.930
failing marriage,

33:58.980 --> 34:01.653
means that you don't really know
what you've been doing.

34:01.700 --> 34:04.851
No. I knew what I was doing.

34:04.900 --> 34:09.212
Undertakers. Newsagents. Chip shop. Sue me.

34:11.100 --> 34:13.739
Make me bankrupt. It'll end all the turmoil.

34:13.780 --> 34:16.248
You see, Rosie's been having affairs.

34:18.540 --> 34:21.532
- Awful, isn't it?
- Yeah, yeah.

34:21.580 --> 34:22.774
<i>I thought...</i>

34:24.340 --> 34:26.808
...if I bought her something, she'd stop.

34:27.659 --> 34:29.297
I got her a diamond necklace.

34:29.980 --> 34:32.574
I knew it was wrong, but I didn't know what to do.

34:32.620 --> 34:34.371
Peter...

34:34.420 --> 34:36.172
I want her back.

34:36.940 --> 34:39.454
Simon... what do you suggest?

34:39.500 --> 34:41.058
Erm...

34:42.100 --> 34:45.137
Well... difficult one, isn't it?

34:45.179 --> 34:47.091
Mm. Isn't it?

34:48.219 --> 34:51.053
(Tearfully) I feel like such a failure!

34:51.100 --> 34:55.935
Listen. Will you excuse us? I'd really like
to get Simon's considered opinion on this.

35:02.060 --> 35:03.573
Pleased with yourself?

35:03.620 --> 35:06.453
Peter, I do not know what you are talking about.

35:06.500 --> 35:08.491
No? Well, let me remind you.

35:09.420 --> 35:11.934
I do wish you'd clear up after your messes.

35:11.980 --> 35:14.448
I found these in my glove compartment.

35:14.500 --> 35:16.377
Mrs Rosie Pearson.

35:16.420 --> 35:19.378
Well, you heard it yourself: It wasn't just me.

35:19.420 --> 35:21.411
Oh, so, you joined a queue, did you?

35:21.460 --> 35:25.772
The poor man is having a nervous breakdown,
and you're gallivanting with his wife!

35:25.820 --> 35:28.380
Do you have an ounce of remorse in
your whole body?

35:28.420 --> 35:31.810
- I didn't know it was affecting him.
- Affecting him?

35:32.860 --> 35:37.172
Do you have any capacity to
distinguish between right and wrong?

35:37.220 --> 35:41.896
Or does that all go west as soon as you scent
the soft allure of some marital thighs?

35:41.940 --> 35:44.534
We're not all like you, Peter!

35:44.580 --> 35:47.253
We're not all Mr bloody High And Mighty.

35:47.300 --> 35:50.212
What happened to common decency?

35:50.260 --> 35:52.216
Well, all right. OK, OK.

35:52.900 --> 35:54.891
What do you want me to do, then?

36:01.180 --> 36:02.659
Reparation.

36:03.900 --> 36:06.698
For all the damage you've caused.

36:06.740 --> 36:07.889
Ah...

36:13.820 --> 36:18.211
Mr Kingdom. Will they soon be
polishing their balls on my whites?

36:18.260 --> 36:21.491
Sadly not. No. Erm...

36:21.540 --> 36:23.929
We found we couldn't enforce the contract.

36:23.980 --> 36:26.494
I'm afraid you're the victim of a confidence trick.

36:26.540 --> 36:29.100
And you're not the only one.

36:29.140 --> 36:30.892
I've lost my money?

36:31.940 --> 36:34.818
Well, actually, I did manage to trace it.

36:38.860 --> 36:42.614
Mr Kingdom... I don't know how to thank you.

36:42.660 --> 36:44.696
Don't be silly.

36:44.740 --> 36:46.332
Oh, hello.

36:47.380 --> 36:52.135
Will Lyle be free to join a protest at lunch time?

36:52.180 --> 36:54.933
This lunch time? Oh, I'm sorry. I'm afraid not.

36:54.980 --> 36:56.732
Oh.

36:56.780 --> 37:01.296
Would you be offended if, every time
I get arrested, I ask for him in future?

37:01.340 --> 37:02.978
Offended? Not in the slightest.

37:04.140 --> 37:07.052
Er... I understand you sell handcuffs?

37:07.660 --> 37:08.570
Yes.

37:08.620 --> 37:10.770
I'll... leave you to it.

37:10.820 --> 37:14.051
Oh, no, don't go.
I've got the order for your aunt's care home.

37:14.100 --> 37:15.931
<i>I've put in extra whipped cream.</i>

37:15.980 --> 37:18.619
Good. Thank you.

37:29.380 --> 37:35.091
Don't buy willies from Tiger Lily's!
Don't buy willies from Tiger Lily's.

37:35.140 --> 37:36.971
Well, I won't, then.

37:37.020 --> 37:39.773
Don't buy willies from Tiger Lily's!

37:44.340 --> 37:47.855
<i>Hello, Mr Good Samaritan.</i>

37:47.900 --> 37:50.050
If you've finished now...

37:50.100 --> 37:52.534
can I have the rest of my money back, please?

37:52.580 --> 37:55.458
Oh, no. Not until after the trial.

37:55.500 --> 38:01.735
I'm keeping it out of your reach, until you show
me you can behave like a responsible adult.

38:01.780 --> 38:04.931
And what's more, dear brother,
we all know perfectly well

38:04.980 --> 38:08.290
that the moment I give it to you,
you'll be out of the door in a flash.

38:17.540 --> 38:21.499
It was a protest against
the sexual enslavement of women.

38:21.540 --> 38:25.818
Yes. But you assaulted DC Yelland
with a spanking paddle.

38:25.860 --> 38:28.249
Now, if you're lucky, you might get off with a fine.

38:28.300 --> 38:33.215
And then, perhaps, together, we could really
tackle the issue of renewable energy.

38:33.260 --> 38:35.091
<i>And CC TV.</i>

38:35.140 --> 38:37.973
And those microchips
they put inside the dustbins.

38:38.020 --> 38:39.738
Perhaps, Henny.

38:41.100 --> 38:42.977
We'll see.

38:45.060 --> 38:47.733
He's a decent man, Rosie.

38:47.780 --> 38:49.498
He loves you.

38:50.260 --> 38:52.728
But we had such a great time.

38:52.780 --> 38:54.372
I know. I know.

38:54.420 --> 38:56.490
And that's how we should remember it.

38:58.020 --> 39:00.614
- Look, I know there have been others.
- (Sobs)

39:02.020 --> 39:05.979
I've done a lot of running away
from problems myself, Rosie.

39:06.020 --> 39:09.251
And in the end,
you find the problems come with you.

39:09.300 --> 39:13.930
And sometimes the best thing is...
to confront them.

39:15.220 --> 39:19.293
Talk to him, Rosie.
Give your marriage a chance.

39:20.020 --> 39:21.692
Talk.

39:23.700 --> 39:25.691
(Sobs)

39:38.100 --> 39:39.499
Mr Kingdom.

39:39.540 --> 39:41.815
Mr Snell, is there something wrong
with the door?

39:41.860 --> 39:45.216
Would you thank your brother for me?

39:45.260 --> 39:46.773
Thank Simon? What for?

39:46.820 --> 39:51.336
Special delivery from Trondheim.
And I got compensation.

39:51.380 --> 39:54.258
I'll certainly pass on your thanks. Yes.

39:54.300 --> 39:57.098
Thing is, I'm not sure how to put it together.

39:57.900 --> 40:00.130
Why don't you just wait here a moment?

40:05.580 --> 40:08.492
I don't know what all the fuss is about.
It's simple.

40:08.540 --> 40:11.054
Well, I'm glad, because it's for your mother.

40:11.100 --> 40:13.056
- From you?
- Not exactly.

40:13.100 --> 40:15.250
(Laughs) Sidney, what's going on?

40:15.300 --> 40:16.779
A-ha!

40:18.900 --> 40:20.299
Sidney!

40:20.340 --> 40:23.173
I've bought you... a birthday present!

40:25.380 --> 40:26.972
It's lovely.

40:27.820 --> 40:30.209
Mum, I'm not stupid. I know.

40:31.100 --> 40:33.091
- You don't mind?
- No.

40:34.300 --> 40:35.892
Cost you a tenner, though.

40:35.940 --> 40:38.215
Well... done.

40:40.420 --> 40:42.058
What is it?

40:42.100 --> 40:44.739
Well, it's a ski trainer.

40:44.780 --> 40:46.452
A ski trainer?

40:46.500 --> 40:49.219
I'm touched. I really am.

40:50.420 --> 40:54.459
See, the thing is,
Mr Kingdom had to threaten to sue 'em.

40:54.500 --> 40:57.810
And as a result, I got compensation, so...

40:57.860 --> 40:59.816
Mrs Gloria Millington,

40:59.860 --> 41:02.169
would you do me the signal honour

41:02.220 --> 41:07.055
of being my companion
on the Nordic Princess?

41:07.100 --> 41:11.571
They've sent us two tickets for
a cruise up the Norwegian fjords!

41:11.620 --> 41:13.611
Oh, Mr Snell!

41:14.940 --> 41:18.535
Scott, that thing we were going to
talk about - remember? We should...

41:19.220 --> 41:21.450
Well, I'll take that as a yes, then.

41:22.820 --> 41:25.857
And... happy birthday.

41:29.660 --> 41:30.979
Thank you.

41:34.020 --> 41:35.692
(Chiming)

41:38.940 --> 41:40.419
(Cheering and applause)

41:40.460 --> 41:42.451
(Bell)

41:52.580 --> 41:54.571
Is it safe to show my face?

41:55.820 --> 41:58.414
Well, the only way to find out is to confront it.

41:58.460 --> 42:01.532
A little contrition. A little explanation.

42:01.580 --> 42:05.255
You'd be amazed how understanding
Market Shipborough can be.

42:05.300 --> 42:08.531
Where's Simon? He's supposed to be
opening the batting for me.

42:08.580 --> 42:10.571
He's playing instead of me.

42:10.620 --> 42:14.613
Yeah, well, reliability
was never really his strong point.

42:14.660 --> 42:17.413
Oh, no. They'll hate me even more now.

42:18.020 --> 42:22.650
Nigel! You've got to stop trying to
please everyone all the time.

42:22.700 --> 42:24.497
You already do a lot for this town.

42:24.540 --> 42:28.249
Maybe it's time you concentrated on doing
things for yourself for a while.

42:28.300 --> 42:32.771
But, as for your opening-bat problem,
I do know someone.

42:33.500 --> 42:36.173
Possibly even better than Simon.

42:38.060 --> 42:40.051
Go on!

42:56.700 --> 42:58.850
Nigel, I...

42:58.900 --> 43:00.777
I just...

43:00.820 --> 43:02.936
Oh, I'm sorry!

43:04.980 --> 43:07.096
We need to get to know each other again.

43:14.220 --> 43:16.211
CRICKETER: <i>Out!</i>

43:44.140 --> 43:46.131
(Cheering)

43:46.900 --> 43:48.936
(Chuckles)

44:01.620 --> 44:03.611
- One run!
(Cheering)

44:05.700 --> 44:06.815
(Applause)

44:10.020 --> 44:12.090
Good knock, Scott!

44:12.140 --> 44:15.655
Always play the ball that's bowled,
not the one you're expecting.

44:15.700 --> 44:17.691
How right you are!

44:18.820 --> 44:21.414
- Well done!
- Well done, mate?????«??????????????????????????????????????????
