WEBVTT

00:07.038 --> 00:12.613
IT WOULD SEEM OUR FATES
ARE ON A COLLISION COURSE.

00:12.613 --> 00:15.346
FIND DYSON FROST YESTERDAY.

00:15.346 --> 00:17.488
THE NEXT MOVE
IS MARK BENFORD'S.

00:17.488 --> 00:19.490
DYSON FROST?
IT'S YOUR MOVE.

00:19.490 --> 00:21.392
I TOOK THIS PICTURE.

00:21.392 --> 00:23.054
SHE SAW SOMETHING
SHE SHOULDN'T HAVE

00:23.054 --> 00:25.226
AND GOT IN TROUBLE
WITH JERICHO.

00:25.226 --> 00:27.058
THE SECOND THAT JERICHO
KNOWS THAT I'M STILL ALIVE...
(grunts)

00:27.058 --> 00:29.800
THEY'LL FIND ME,
AND THEY'LL KILL ME.
TRACY STARK--

00:29.800 --> 00:32.303
I KNOW YOU TOOK HER.
NOW YOU'RE GONNA GIVE HER BACK.

00:32.303 --> 00:35.306
I CAN'T GIVE YOU
YOUR DAUGHTER BACK.
THEN WE GO TO WAR.

00:35.306 --> 00:39.110
YOU WILL BE SHOT 3 TIMES
ON MARCH 15th.

00:39.110 --> 00:42.673
IT WILL BE YOUR GUN,
AGENT BENFORD.
(man) DEMETRI?

00:42.673 --> 00:45.246
YEAH?
THE BOX IS HERE,
BUT THE GUN IS GONE.

00:45.246 --> 00:49.580
MY FIRST TERM WAS A BITCH.
I COULD HAVE USED YOU, STAN.

00:49.580 --> 00:51.322
I'M SORRY I COULDN'T
BRING YOU IN.

00:51.322 --> 00:54.125
I DON'T WANT YOU TO THINK
I-I'M HARASSING YOU.

00:54.125 --> 00:58.189
I KNOW. YOU'RE JUST TRYING
TO SAVE THE WORLD. GOOD-BYE.

00:58.189 --> 01:01.232
SHE WAS
SIGNALING HER HANDLERS.

01:01.232 --> 01:03.264
(firing)

01:03.264 --> 01:06.097
(Simon) I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN--
TWO MOLES,

01:06.097 --> 01:09.069
IN CASE ONE IS CAUGHT--
AND NOT ONE PERSON IN THE OFFICE

01:09.069 --> 01:10.741
WOULD SUSPECT IT'S YOU.

01:15.446 --> 01:18.749
(Mark) TODAY IS MORE THAN JUST
THE BEGINNING OF YOUR CAREER.

01:18.749 --> 01:22.183
TODAY,
ALONG WITH A BADGE AND A GUN,

01:22.183 --> 01:26.557
YOU'RE GONNA GET A STORY
ABOUT YOUR FIRST DAY ON THE JOB.

01:26.557 --> 01:29.860
EVERY SPECIAL AGENT HAS ONE.

01:29.860 --> 01:32.863
SOME ARE FUNNY.
SOME ARE TRAGIC.

01:32.863 --> 01:35.095
SOME ARE BORING.

01:35.095 --> 01:37.628
BUT TODAY WON'T BE
THE MOST IMPORTANT DAY

01:37.628 --> 01:39.200
IN YOUR CAREER
AS AN FBI AGENT.

01:39.200 --> 01:42.403
THAT DAY IS SOMEWHERE
DOWN THE LINE.

01:42.403 --> 01:46.137
YOU WON'T SEE IT COMING.
IT SNEAKS UP ON YOU.

01:46.137 --> 01:48.879
IT'LL MOST LIKELY BE
AN ANONYMOUS MOMENT--

01:48.879 --> 01:51.442
A CROSSROADS WHERE YOU'RE
ASKED TO DO SOMETHING,

01:51.442 --> 01:53.444
MAKE SOME KIND
OF PERSONAL SACRIFICE

01:53.444 --> 01:56.487
FOR THE GOOD OF SOMEONE ELSE,
AND THAT PERSON MAY NEVER KNOW

01:56.487 --> 02:00.821
YOUR NAME OR SEE YOUR FACE
OR EVEN UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU DID.

02:00.821 --> 02:03.894
BUT YOU'LL KNOW.

02:03.894 --> 02:07.228
AND ISN'T THAT WHY YOU'RE HERE,
AFTER ALL?

02:07.228 --> 02:09.800
BECAUSE YOU CAN BE COUNTED ON
TO DO THE RIGHT THING

02:09.800 --> 02:14.205
AT THE RIGHT TIME, EVERY TIME.

02:14.205 --> 02:15.836
WELCOME TO THE FBI.

02:19.540 --> 02:21.872
WELL DONE. NICELY DONE.

02:24.345 --> 02:26.347
ALL RIGHT,
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.

02:26.347 --> 02:28.879
SEE ME FOR YOUR PARTNER
ASSIGNMENTS. CONGRATULATIONS.

02:30.481 --> 02:33.624
(Wedeck) NICELY DONE.
(Demetri) SPECIAL AGENT VREEDE--

02:33.624 --> 02:36.156
IS IT "VREED-Y"
OR "VREEDE" AS IN "FREED"?

02:36.156 --> 02:38.429
OH, I DON'T KNOW.
I GOT BENFORD.

02:38.429 --> 02:40.291
NO. SWITCH WITH ME.

02:40.291 --> 02:42.333
WHY?
HE'S A LEGEND.
HE'S DONE IT ALL--

02:42.333 --> 02:45.296
SURVEILLANCE, COUNTERTERRORISM,
TRAFFICKING. COME ON.

02:45.296 --> 02:48.399
DO IT.
WHATEVER, BUT YOU GOTTA
TAKE IT UP WITH WEDECK

02:48.399 --> 02:50.601
AND GET IT APPROVED.
DONE. THANK YOU.

02:50.601 --> 02:52.473
OF COURSE.
YES!

02:52.473 --> 02:55.906
JANIS, WHO'D YOU GET?
NO PARTNER.
HEADED TO ANALYSIS. BORING.

02:55.906 --> 02:58.679
YOU KNOW, I GOT IT WORSE.
I REPORT TO YOU.
(chuckles)

02:58.679 --> 03:01.252
(laughs)
I MEAN, HOW COULD THAT BE?
I SCORED HIGHER.

03:01.252 --> 03:02.953
YEAH, IN, LIKE, ONE CATEGORY.

03:02.953 --> 03:06.387
COME ON, MARCIE.
WE'LL HAVE FUN.
YEAH, WE'VE BEEN A TEAM
SINCE QUANTICO--

03:06.387 --> 03:09.260
BOOZE AND BULLETS.
YEAH, WELL,
WHAT AM I, THE MASCOT?

03:09.260 --> 03:10.891
NO, YOU'RE LIKE OUR CAPTAIN.

03:10.891 --> 03:13.724
YEAH, YOU'LL PROBABLY
OUTPACE ALL OF US.

03:13.724 --> 03:15.666
I'M SURE OF IT.
YEAH, WE'RE--WE'RE SURE.

03:15.666 --> 03:18.629
(beep, door opens)

03:18.629 --> 03:20.631
(door closes)

03:20.631 --> 03:22.633
(Mark) INTERVIEW
OF MARCIE TUROFF,

03:22.633 --> 03:25.776
AGENTS BENFORD
AND NOH QUESTIONING.

03:25.776 --> 03:28.208
MARCH 12, 2010.

03:28.208 --> 03:30.241
FIRST THING
WE'D LIKE TO KNOW IS--

03:30.241 --> 03:33.344
WHO CAME AFTER US IN THAT
PARKING GARAGE IN D.C.?
I DON'T KNOW.

03:33.344 --> 03:37.548
WHO CAME AFTER US
IN THE PARKING GARAGE IN D.C.?
I DON'T KNOW.

03:37.548 --> 03:40.220
ON TO THE NEXT.
ARE THEY STILL AFTER US?

03:40.220 --> 03:43.354
I DON'T KNOW.
DEMETRI.

03:43.354 --> 03:45.756
WHO KILLED IAN McKINNON?
COME ON. LET'S GO.

03:45.756 --> 03:48.799
IS THAT WHO'S COMING AFTER ME?
LET'S GO.

03:51.462 --> 03:54.535
WE NEED THOSE ANSWERS.

03:54.535 --> 03:56.907
YEAH, BUT THERE ARE
A WHOLE LOT OF OTHER ONES

03:56.907 --> 03:59.940
WE NEED TO GET TO FIRST.
LISTEN, DEM.

03:59.940 --> 04:03.314
YOU THINK I DON'T HAVE
MARCH 15th CIRCLED

04:03.314 --> 04:04.815
IN MY CALENDAR, TOO?

04:04.815 --> 04:07.948
WE BOTH KNOW THERE'S A CHANCE
YOU'LL DIE IN THREE DAYS.

04:07.948 --> 04:09.950
LOOK, YOU KEEP
CHASING DOWN LEADS.

04:09.950 --> 04:12.423
I'LL LET YOU KNOW WHEN
WE'RE READY FOR YOUR QUESTIONS,

04:12.423 --> 04:13.924
ALL RIGHT?

04:13.924 --> 04:17.458
HEY, JANIS, I NEED YOUR HELP
IN HERE WITH MARCIE.
ME?

04:17.458 --> 04:19.259
WHAT, YOU GOT SOMETHING
MORE IMPORTANT

04:19.259 --> 04:21.261
THAN GRILLING OUR MOLE?

04:21.261 --> 04:23.634
NO. OF COURSE NOT.

04:31.342 --> 04:35.346
WHAT WERE YOUR DUTIES?

04:35.346 --> 04:38.008
EVERY WEEK, I'D TAKE WHATEVER
INFORMATION THERE WAS

04:38.008 --> 04:41.952
IN THE MOSAIC INVESTIGATION
AND LEAVE IT AT A DEAD DROP.

04:41.952 --> 04:44.014
WHO RECRUITED YOU?

04:46.657 --> 04:49.760
I WAS APPROACHED BY A MAN THREE
MONTHS BEFORE THE BLACKOUT HIT.

04:49.760 --> 04:51.492
WHAT WAS HIS NAME?

04:51.492 --> 04:54.825
ALL IN DUE TIME.

04:54.825 --> 04:57.968
HE ASKED IF I WANTED TO BE
A PART OF SOMETHING BIG.

04:57.968 --> 04:59.870
AND YOU SAID YES.

05:02.973 --> 05:05.676
YOU THINK I SOLD OUT
MY FRIENDS AND MY COUNTRY,

05:05.676 --> 05:07.738
BUT... YOU DON'T KNOW ME.

05:09.810 --> 05:11.982
WHY DON'T YOU ENLIGHTEN US?

05:13.814 --> 05:16.316
COME ON. DON'T YOU REMEMBER
MY FLASH-FORWARD?

05:19.790 --> 05:22.593
NO, YOU DON'T,
'CAUSE NEITHER OF YOU

05:22.593 --> 05:24.995
EVER BOTHERED TO ASK ME
WHAT I SAW.

05:24.995 --> 05:26.927
(whoosh)

05:26.927 --> 05:29.900
I WAS INCARCERATED.

05:33.003 --> 05:35.005
THAT DIDN'T CROSS YOUR MIND

05:35.005 --> 05:38.008
WHEN YOU SHOT SIX
OF YOUR FELLOW AGENTS?

05:38.008 --> 05:40.671
(firing)

05:40.671 --> 05:41.972
IT DID.

05:41.972 --> 05:43.974
BUT EVEN THOUGH
I WAS IN JAIL,

05:43.974 --> 05:46.677
I WAS HAPPIER
THAN I'VE BEEN IN YEARS.

05:46.677 --> 05:50.481
(whoosh)
I THOUGHT WE'D HAVE TO BEG
FOR LIFE WITHOUT PAROLE.

05:50.481 --> 05:53.654
I TOLD YOU THEY'D COME AROUND.
UNTIL I TELL THEM

05:53.654 --> 05:56.387
WHO RECRUITED ME,
I'M INDISPENSABLE.
FOR THE FIRST TIME
SINCE I GOT HERE,

05:56.387 --> 05:58.559
I ACTUALLY FELT LIKE
I WAS IMPORTANT.

06:05.035 --> 06:07.898
(Wedeck) I NEED YOU MARK.

06:12.002 --> 06:14.745
THESE ARE OUR GUESTS
FROM WASHINGTON.

06:14.745 --> 06:17.408
AND WHILE THEY'RE GRATEFUL
FOR ALL OUR EFFORTS

06:17.408 --> 06:21.782
IN APPREHENDING
AGENT TUROFF...
OH, NO. YOU GOTTA BE KIDDING.

06:21.782 --> 06:24.755
DIRECTOR MIDDLETON
FEELS MORE COMFORTABLE

06:24.755 --> 06:27.057
HAVING SUCH
A HIGHLY VALUED TARGET

06:27.057 --> 06:31.662
WHERE HE CAN KEEP AN EYE ON HER.
AND WHERE HE CAN GIVE
THE PRESS CONFERENCES HIMSELF.

06:31.662 --> 06:34.865
HEAR ME OUT.
WE KNOW HER. WE CAN READ HER.

06:34.865 --> 06:37.027
JUST GIVE US ONE MORE DAY.

06:48.809 --> 06:50.541
I KNOW IT'S FRUSTRATING,

06:50.541 --> 06:52.943
BUT LET'S TRY TO GET SOMETHING
POSITIVE DONE TODAY--

06:52.943 --> 06:55.145
LIKE MAYBE GET BACK
TO WHAT CAUSED THE BLACKOUT.

06:55.145 --> 06:58.048
NOW I'LL BE OUT OF THE OFFICE
FOR A COUPLE OF HOURS,

06:58.048 --> 06:59.490
SO GIVE ME AN UPDATE.
DYSON FROST--

06:59.490 --> 07:01.552
HE'S OUR BEST LEAD SO FAR.
WHERE ARE WE?

07:01.552 --> 07:03.724
I'VE LEFT FOUR MESSAGES.
HAVEN'T HEARD BACK.

07:03.724 --> 07:06.957
I'M AFRAID HE'S
JUST TOYING WITH US.
THE GUY'S BEEN WANTING
TO TALK TO YOU FOR 19 YEARS,

07:06.957 --> 07:09.730
AND NOW HE'S PLAYING
HARD TO GET?

07:09.730 --> 07:13.033
SHEL, SEE WHAT YOU CAN GET
BY TRACING FROST'S PHONE.
YES, SIR.

07:13.033 --> 07:15.005
HEY,
I JUST GOT A CALL FROM L.A.P.D.

07:15.005 --> 07:18.709
THEY'VE GOT A BALLISTICS REPORT
SAYING THAT MARK'S GUN,

07:18.709 --> 07:21.772
THE ONE THAT'S SUPPOSED
TO KILL ME IN THREE DAYS,

07:21.772 --> 07:25.546
WAS USED IN A MURDER
LAST NIGHT.

07:49.069 --> 07:52.503
(siren wailing in distance)

07:54.545 --> 07:58.008
(Mark) SO WHAT DO WE KNOW
FROM THE EYEWITNESS REPORTS?

07:58.008 --> 08:01.982
55-YEAR-OLD, IN HIS COT,

08:01.982 --> 08:04.014
PRESUMABLY ASLEEP.

08:04.014 --> 08:07.818
AT 3:33 A.M.,
THE SHOOTER WALKED UP TO HIM,

08:07.818 --> 08:10.721
AND A COUPLE OF INSOMNIACS
HEARD THE VICTIM SAY...

08:10.721 --> 08:15.566
I KNEW IT WOULD BE YOU.
I JUST DIDN'T WANT TO BELIEVE.
"I KNEW IT WOULD BE YOU.
I JUST DIDN'T WANT TO BELIEVE."

08:15.566 --> 08:18.098
THE SHOOTER MUST HAVE HAD
A SILENCER ON YOUR GUN.

08:18.098 --> 08:20.070
(muffled shots fire)
(gasps)

08:20.070 --> 08:24.034
HE PLUGGED HIM THREE TIMES
IN THE CHEST AT CLOSE RANGE.

08:25.936 --> 08:29.640
UH, DO YOU WANT TO PUT
THAT THING AWAY?

08:29.640 --> 08:31.712
SORRY.
THANKS.

08:31.712 --> 08:33.113
PHYSICAL DESCRIPTION

08:33.113 --> 08:35.245
RANGING FROM...

08:35.245 --> 08:39.089
5'5" WHITE GUY
TO A 6' INDIAN.

08:39.089 --> 08:40.791
ANOTHER DEAD END.

08:40.791 --> 08:42.923
WASN'T THERE SOMETHING
ABOUT A CAR?

08:42.923 --> 08:45.856
UH...

08:45.856 --> 08:50.000
SOMEBODY SAID THEY SAW A 1970s
BLUE SEDAN DRIVE AWAY--

08:50.000 --> 08:51.862
FOREIGN MAKE.

08:51.862 --> 08:54.104
THAT'S A START.
(scoffs)

08:54.104 --> 08:57.708
L.A.P.D.'s GONNA FORWARD
THE VICTIM'S EFFECTS TO US.

08:57.708 --> 08:59.610
CAN'T WAIT
TO SIFT THROUGH THAT.

08:59.610 --> 09:02.112
FORGET ABOUT THE SHOOTER.

09:02.112 --> 09:05.876
WHO'S THE ONE OTHER PERSON
WE KNOW WHO HANDLED THAT GUN?

09:05.876 --> 09:08.048
THERE WERE 40 AGENTS
IN THAT EVIDENCE ROOM.

09:08.048 --> 09:10.921
THEY WERE ALL CLEARED
MONTHS AGO.

09:10.921 --> 09:13.954
ONE OF THOSE AGENTS MARCIE?

09:15.255 --> 09:17.658
(jet engines roaring)

09:17.658 --> 09:19.630
(Demetri) MARCIE!

09:19.630 --> 09:22.993
STOP! STOP!
YOU GUYS NEVER GIVE UP.

09:22.993 --> 09:26.136
I NEED TO TALK TO HER.
SHE'S IN OUR CUSTODY NOW.

09:26.136 --> 09:29.139
YOU CAN'T TAKE HER.
SHE'S PART OF OUR INVESTIGATION.
I'M JUST DOING MY JOB,
SAME AS YOU DOING YOURS.

09:29.139 --> 09:31.271
WHO'D YOU GIVE MY GUN TO,
MARCIE?
I DON'T KNOW.

09:31.271 --> 09:33.343
COME ON. WHO HAS IT?
I DON'T KNOW.

09:33.343 --> 09:35.876
COME ON. DON'T DO THIS.
WE WERE FRIENDS.

09:35.876 --> 09:37.878
LOOK, I'M SORRY.
REALLY, I AM.

09:37.878 --> 09:40.811
ALL I HEARD IS THAT
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO DIE IN L.A.

09:40.811 --> 09:43.854
WHAT?
GIVE ME MORE SPECIFICS.

09:43.854 --> 09:45.986
WHO DOES IT? WHEN?
IT WAS A VOICE ON THE PHONE

09:45.986 --> 09:48.889
WHEN I CALLED TO REPORT
THE GUN IN LOCKUP.
WHO'D YOU CALL?

09:48.889 --> 09:51.862
A NUMBER.
IT WAS DIFFERENT EVERY TIME.

09:51.862 --> 09:54.865
LOOK, THAT'S ALL I KNOW.
THERE ISN'T ANY MORE.

09:54.865 --> 09:57.067
LOOK, YOU'RE GONNA DIE
IN THREE DAYS,

09:57.067 --> 09:59.930
AND THERE'S NOTHING
YOU CAN DO TO STOP IT.

09:59.930 --> 10:02.673
I'M SORRY.

10:04.134 --> 10:07.708
(woman) COME ON.
MARCIE, COME ON.

10:07.708 --> 10:11.882
MARCIE! MARCIE! MARCIE!

10:16.186 --> 10:17.988
(children shouting indistinctly)

10:17.988 --> 10:20.020
(Charlie) COME ON, COME ON!

10:20.020 --> 10:22.192
SWEETIE, WHAT IS THE HURRY?
WE'RE HERE.

10:22.192 --> 10:25.025
I TOLD HIM WE'D BE HERE
BY 2:00. WE'RE LATE.
WHO?

10:25.025 --> 10:26.727
DYLAN!

10:26.727 --> 10:29.629
(Charlie) HEY, DYLAN.

10:29.629 --> 10:32.703
NUTS TO YOU, SQUIRRLIO!
TOOT! TOOT!
TOOT! TOOT!

10:32.703 --> 10:34.634
COME ON, DYLAN!
OKAY, I'M COMING.

10:34.634 --> 10:37.037
DID YOU KNOW ABOUT THIS?

10:37.037 --> 10:39.039
ABSOLUTELY NOT.

10:39.039 --> 10:41.742
CHARLIE, WHO ARRANGED THIS?

10:41.742 --> 10:43.714
I DID! I GOT DYLAN'S
PHONE NUMBER FROM HIM

10:43.714 --> 10:46.176
WHEN HE WAS
IN THE HOSPITAL.

10:46.176 --> 10:48.648
HE WAS VERY INSISTENT
ABOUT THIS SPECIFIC PARK,

10:48.648 --> 10:52.683
AND NOW I KNOW WHY.
DO YOU NORMALLY COME HERE?

10:52.683 --> 10:55.285
WELL, THE HOUSE IS
JUST AROUND THE CORNER.

10:55.285 --> 10:57.057
RIGHT.

10:57.057 --> 10:59.830
(Charlie laughing)

10:59.830 --> 11:01.391
THIS IS FUN.
COME ON. YOU GO FIRST.

11:01.391 --> 11:04.434
LOOK, I-I CAN SIT
ON A BENCH OR SOMETHING.

11:04.434 --> 11:07.938
IT'S FINE.
DOESN'T HAVE TO BE THAT WAY.

11:07.938 --> 11:11.772
(Charlie screaming and crying)
CHARLIE?

11:11.772 --> 11:14.745
(Lloyd) DYLAN, WHAT HAPPENED?
(Olivia) LET ME SEE, SWEETIE.

11:14.745 --> 11:17.047
(Dylan) WE BONKED HEADS.
DID HE HIT YOUR TEETH?

11:17.047 --> 11:20.210
LET ME SEE, BABY. OKAY,
CHARLIE, LET'S SEE. OPEN UP.
(Dylan) SORRY, CHARLIE.

11:20.210 --> 11:22.452
I'M BLEEDING.
OKAY. LET ME SEE.

11:22.452 --> 11:25.716
(Dylan) IS SHE OKAY?
OPEN YOUR MOUTH.

11:25.716 --> 11:29.089
HERE WE GO, CHARLIE.
I WANT YOU TO DO SOMETHING NOW.

11:29.089 --> 11:31.762
JUST--JUST GRAB MY HAND,
AND WHEN IT HURTS,

11:31.762 --> 11:34.164
I WANT YOU TO SQUEEZE
AS HARD AS POSSIBLE, OKAY?

11:34.164 --> 11:36.296
IS THAT ALL YOU GOT? COME ON.

11:36.296 --> 11:38.899
YOU TRY A LITTLE BIT HARDER
THAN THAT. THAT'S GOOD.

11:38.899 --> 11:42.973
DOES THIS MEAN I CAN'T GO
TO THE CARNIVAL, MOMMY?
NO, I THINK YOU'RE GONNA BE
JUST FINE FOR THE CARNIVAL.

11:42.973 --> 11:44.735
I THINK
YOU'RE GONNA BE OKAY.

11:44.735 --> 11:47.377
YEAH, THAT'S GOOD. I'M STARTING
TO FEEL THAT A BIT NOW.

11:47.377 --> 11:50.110
LISTEN, I'M JUST GONNA GO BACK
TO THE CAR AND GET

11:50.110 --> 11:52.883
A BOTTLE OF WATER AND A TOWEL.
YOU'LL BE OKAY.
OKAY.

11:52.883 --> 11:55.715
YEAH. I SEE CARNIVALS
IN YOUR FUTURE. COME HERE.
I WANNA GO.

11:55.715 --> 11:59.850
I KNOW. COME HERE.
IT'S OKAY, SWEETIE.

12:15.305 --> 12:17.838
ASSISTANT DIRECTOR WEDECK?

12:17.838 --> 12:19.940
THAT'S ME.

12:19.940 --> 12:22.112
COME THIS WAY.

12:22.112 --> 12:23.814
SHE'S READY FOR YOU.

12:23.814 --> 12:24.845
THANK YOU.

12:31.882 --> 12:33.884
MADAME VICE PRESIDENT.

12:33.884 --> 12:36.186
(sighs)
GOOD TO SEE YOU, STAN.

12:36.186 --> 12:38.758
IT'S BEEN QUITE A WHILE.

12:38.758 --> 12:40.931
PLEASE SIT.
THANK YOU.

12:42.963 --> 12:44.434
(sighs)

12:46.967 --> 12:50.540
THANKS FOR COMING
ON SUCH SHORT NOTICE, STAN.

12:50.540 --> 12:52.873
HOW IS EVERYTHING?

12:52.873 --> 12:55.946
YOU WANT TO TELL ME WHY THE HELL
YOU DRAGGED ME OUT HERE?

12:55.946 --> 12:58.378
(chuckles) IT'S NICE
TO KNOW MY NEW POSITION

12:58.378 --> 13:02.252
HASN'T CHANGED
YOUR ATTITUDE TOWARDS ME.

13:02.252 --> 13:05.315
DOES THE NAME JERICHO
RING A BELL?

13:05.315 --> 13:08.488
THEY'RE A PRIVATE CONTRACTOR
OPERATING OVER IN AFGHANISTAN.

13:08.488 --> 13:10.190
I'VE HEARD OF THEM.

13:10.190 --> 13:12.993
AGENT BENFORD LOOKED
INTO THEM A WHILE BACK.

13:14.064 --> 13:15.896
YES?

13:15.896 --> 13:19.870
WELL, IN MY SECURITY BRIEFING
THIS MORNING,

13:19.870 --> 13:22.973
I LEARNED THAT JERICHO'S C.E.O.
JUST TRIPLED THE SECURITY

13:22.973 --> 13:26.206
AROUND HIS MALIBU COMPOUND.
I THINK YOU SHOULD TAKE A LOOK.

13:26.206 --> 13:28.939
WRONG DEPARTMENT.
NSA IS WHO YOU WANT TO CALL.

13:28.939 --> 13:32.342
I DON'T WANT THEM TO KNOW.

13:32.342 --> 13:35.215
I NEED THIS DONE
OFF THE BOOKS.

13:35.215 --> 13:37.147
THE VICE PRESIDENT DOESN'T
FLY ACROSS THE COUNTRY

13:37.147 --> 13:40.120
'CAUSE SOME GUY HIRED
AN EXTRA NIGHT WATCHMAN.

13:40.120 --> 13:43.353
(sighs)

13:46.096 --> 13:50.861
IN MY VISION, IT WAS CLEAR THAT
JERICHO HAD DONE SOME THINGS

13:50.861 --> 13:53.503
THAT THREATENED
OUR NATIONAL SECURITY.

13:53.503 --> 13:57.037
THE SAME VISION WHERE YOU
SAW YOURSELF AS PRESIDENT?

13:57.037 --> 13:59.009
(whoosh)

13:59.009 --> 14:03.113
AS A MATTER OF FACT, YES.
AND I WAS THERE BECAUSE JERICHO

14:03.113 --> 14:05.615
DID SOMETHING THAT TRIGGERED
A POLITICAL CRISIS.

14:05.615 --> 14:09.279
I CAN'T FIND OUT ANYTHING
ABOUT WHAT THEY'RE DOING.

14:09.279 --> 14:11.882
BUT IF IT'S BAD ENOUGH
TO BRING DOWN PRESIDENT SEGOVIA,

14:11.882 --> 14:13.623
IT MUST BE SIGNIFICANT.

14:13.623 --> 14:16.586
I'VE BEEN KEEPING A CLOSE EYE
ON EVERY MOVE THEY MAKE,

14:16.586 --> 14:20.130
AND SOMETHING
IS HAPPENING RIGHT NOW.

14:20.130 --> 14:22.632
ARE YOU SURE YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT IT IS?

14:22.632 --> 14:27.467
EVEN IF I DID,
DAVE AND I GO BACK 25 YEARS.

14:27.467 --> 14:32.142
LISTEN, THESE FLASH-FORWARDS
ARE COMING TRUE.

14:32.142 --> 14:34.274
SEGOVIA IS GOING DOWN.

14:35.976 --> 14:39.980
DO YOU WANT TO BE OUT WITH
THE OLD OR IN WITH THE NEW?

14:51.361 --> 14:54.024
(Demetri) WELL, NOW WE KNOW
YOUR GUN'S HERE IN L.A.

14:54.024 --> 14:57.427
YEAH, TOO BAD MARCIE COULDN'T
TELL US WHO'S USING IT.
SO I'LL RUN THIS CAR INFO,

14:57.427 --> 15:00.270
SEE IF ANYTHING PINGS
ON A 1970s BLUE SEDAN.

15:00.270 --> 15:03.103
WE'RE GONNA GET THIS GUY.
YEAH.

15:03.103 --> 15:05.936
GOT A SECOND?

15:05.936 --> 15:07.477
JERICHO--

15:07.477 --> 15:10.580
YOU USED OUR DATABASE TO LOOK
INTO THEM A FEW MONTHS AGO.

15:10.580 --> 15:14.144
IS THAT A PROBLEM?
NO, NO.
JUST CURIOUS WHY YOU DID.

15:14.144 --> 15:16.246
IT WAS A FAVOR FOR A FRIEND--

15:16.246 --> 15:19.019
WANTED AS MUCH INFORMATION
AS I COULD GIVE HIM,

15:19.019 --> 15:22.922
WHICH WASN'T A LOT.
A FRIEND?
DO ALL YOUR FRIENDS ASK YOU

15:22.922 --> 15:26.156
TO RESEARCH THIRD WORLD
MILITARYCONTRACTORS?

15:26.156 --> 15:28.999
HE HAD QUESTIONS
ABOUT HIS DAUGHTER'S DEATH.

15:28.999 --> 15:30.961
SHE WAS SERVING
IN AFGHANISTAN.

15:30.961 --> 15:33.503
HE THINKS
JERICHO IS INVOLVED?

15:36.166 --> 15:40.070
THE THINGS HE TOLD ME--
THEY WERE IN CONFIDENCE.

15:40.070 --> 15:42.342
OH. I CAN RESPECT THAT.

15:42.342 --> 15:43.943
THANKS.

15:43.943 --> 15:47.317
DO YOU MIND
IF I TALK WITH HIM?

15:47.317 --> 15:50.950
MAYBE ASK HIM
A FEW QUESTIONS?

15:50.950 --> 15:52.682
WHAT'S HIS NAME?

15:52.682 --> 15:55.185
AARON STARK.

15:55.185 --> 15:57.327
GOOD LUCK FINDING HIM.

15:57.327 --> 16:00.330
HE'S OFF THE GRID.
I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHERE HE IS

16:00.330 --> 16:03.233
OR HOW TO TRACK HIM DOWN.
THANK YOU, MARK.

16:03.233 --> 16:04.564
SURE.

16:15.745 --> 16:18.148
HEY.
JUST HEARD ON THE SCANNER--

16:18.148 --> 16:20.750
L.A.P.D.'s IN THE MIDDLE
OF A HIGH-SPEED CHASE.

16:20.750 --> 16:23.683
DRIVER--ROSS WEBBER--
HAS BEEN SPOTTED WITH A GUN.

16:23.683 --> 16:26.216
CAR THEY'RE FOLLOWING--
'71 BLUE SEDAN.

16:26.216 --> 16:28.288
THE SHOOTER
FROM THE HOMELESS SHELTER?

16:28.288 --> 16:30.560
HOW MANY CRIMINALS
ARE DRIVING

16:30.560 --> 16:33.463
THE SAME DISCO ERA SEDANS,
RIGHT?
ANY IDEA WHERE THEY'RE HEADED?

16:33.463 --> 16:34.994
(tires screech)

16:34.994 --> 16:36.996
(Mark) THERE'S YOUR BLUE SEDAN.

16:36.996 --> 16:38.598
(men speaking indistinctly)

16:38.598 --> 16:40.430
WHERE IS HE?

16:40.430 --> 16:43.073
RIGHT INSIDE. A BUNCH OF PEOPLE
RAN OUT. HE'S GOT HOSTAGES.

16:43.073 --> 16:45.075
WHERE IN THE BUILDING IS HE?
SECOND FLOOR.

16:45.075 --> 16:48.108
WHO'S TALKING TO HIM?
NO ONE YET.

16:48.108 --> 16:51.781
YOU THINK HE'S JUST GONNA
COME OUT ON HIS OWN?
CAPTAIN DOESN'T WANT US TO DO
ANYTHING TILL HE GETS HERE.

16:51.781 --> 16:54.044
(gunshot)
(man) SHOTS FIRED!
GET DOWN! STAY DOWN!

16:54.044 --> 16:58.118
(woman screaming,
officer shouting indistinctly)

17:01.391 --> 17:03.393
(whispering) YOU HANG BACK.

17:03.393 --> 17:06.726
I TALK TO HIM, TRY TO MAKE SURE
HE RELEASES THE HOSTAGE.

17:06.726 --> 17:10.560
ONCE HE DOES,
YOU TAKE YOUR SHOT.
(lowers voice) SOUNDS GOOD,

17:10.560 --> 17:14.604
EXCEPT FOR THE PART ABOUT ME
STAYING ON THE SIDELINES.

17:14.604 --> 17:17.467
NO WAY
YOU'RE GOING DOWN THERE.

17:17.467 --> 17:21.211
LISTEN, I'M NOT GONNA LET
THAT GUN KILL ONE MORE PERSON.

17:21.211 --> 17:24.414
MARCH 15th--I KNOW THAT'S
THE DAY YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO DIE.

17:24.414 --> 17:28.578
WHO SAYS YOU DIDN'T GET SHOT
THREE DAYS EARLIER?

17:28.578 --> 17:30.750
(man) WHO THE HELL IS THAT?!

17:30.750 --> 17:32.822
(normal voice)
I'M RIGHT HERE!

17:36.686 --> 17:39.429
(lowers voice)
TRY NOT TO SHOOT ME.

17:41.231 --> 17:42.432
OH!
STOP.

17:42.432 --> 17:44.094
(normal voice) OH.

17:44.094 --> 17:47.437
I TOLD THEM THE ONLY PERSON I
WANT TO TALK TO IS RANDY SAVAGE!

17:47.437 --> 17:50.300
MACHO MAN?

17:50.300 --> 17:52.802
YEAH, I DIG THAT.
UH, THAT'S NOT ME.

17:52.802 --> 17:56.546
MY NAME'S DEMETRI.
OH, GOD! (crying)

17:56.546 --> 17:59.209
YOU DON'T TURN AROUND
IN FOUR SECONDS,

17:59.209 --> 18:01.551
I WILL KILL HER, DEMETRI.

18:01.551 --> 18:04.083
DOESN'T MATTER TO ME.
SHE'S JUST A SALESWOMAN.

18:04.083 --> 18:07.086
THAT'S WHAT SHE GETS FOR CAUSING
THE BLACKOUT. I SAID STOP!

18:07.086 --> 18:09.489
OKAY.

18:09.489 --> 18:13.463
ROSS, YOU STILL HAVE
THAT GUN, RIGHT?

18:13.463 --> 18:16.766
I'M GONNA
TAKE THE CLIP OFF NOW.

18:16.766 --> 18:18.768
HERE WE GO.

18:24.174 --> 18:27.106
GONE, BUDDY.

18:27.106 --> 18:28.408
AND, UH...
(gasps)

18:28.408 --> 18:32.482
ON MY ANKLE,
I GOT A GUN, MAN.

18:32.482 --> 18:36.146
I'M GONNA TAKE THAT OFF,
TOO, OKAY?

18:45.425 --> 18:48.728
WE'RE NOT WORRYING
ABOUT THAT ANYMORE.

18:48.728 --> 18:50.200
(crying)

18:50.200 --> 18:52.832
HEY, WHAT WERE YOU
SAYING, THOUGH, ABOUT...

18:52.832 --> 18:56.166
ABOUT HOW SALESPEOPLE
CAUSED THE BLACKOUT?

18:56.166 --> 18:58.508
THAT'S--
THAT'S A FASCINATING THEORY.

18:58.508 --> 19:01.171
I'D LIKE TO HEAR
MORE ABOUT IT.

19:03.243 --> 19:05.815
THEY MADE US
BUY CELL PHONES.

19:05.815 --> 19:07.647
UH-HUH.

19:07.647 --> 19:09.649
SEE, BEFORE EVERYBODY
HAD A CELL PHONE,

19:09.649 --> 19:12.652
NOBODY EVER BLACKED OUT.
NONE OF THIS EVER--STOP MOVING!
(screams)

19:12.652 --> 19:15.625
OKAY.
YOU THINK I WON'T KILL YOU?

19:15.625 --> 19:18.688
YOU'RE ABOUT
JUST PLAIN INCORRECT.

19:18.688 --> 19:21.861
(creaking)
(whimpering)

19:23.933 --> 19:26.165
I'M NOT AFRAID.

19:26.165 --> 19:28.167
(woman crying)

19:28.167 --> 19:31.241
IT'S OKAY.

19:31.241 --> 19:33.803
EVERYBODY'S SCARED OF DYING,
MAN.

19:33.803 --> 19:35.675
(crying)

19:38.478 --> 19:39.809
SHE IS.

19:39.809 --> 19:42.752
LOOK AT HER...

19:42.752 --> 19:44.954
I'M SCARED OF DYING...

19:44.954 --> 19:47.387
ALL THREE OF US.

19:47.387 --> 19:50.660
IT'S WHAT MAKES US HUMAN,
DON'T YOU THINK?

19:52.262 --> 19:55.525
YOU'RE SCARED.

19:55.525 --> 19:57.727
THAT'S FINE.

19:57.727 --> 20:03.433
SEE, WHEN PEOPLE GET SCARED,
JUDGMENT GETS CLOUDED.

20:03.433 --> 20:05.575
I'LL BE HONEST, MAN.

20:05.575 --> 20:08.638
YOU HAVE MADE SOME
REALLY BAD DECISIONS TODAY.

20:12.882 --> 20:17.747
BUT YOU CAN MAKE
A REALLY GOOD ONE RIGHT NOW...

20:17.747 --> 20:19.889
IF YOU JUST GIVE ME THE GUN.

20:19.889 --> 20:22.252
ROSS.

20:22.252 --> 20:24.994
COME ON.

20:24.994 --> 20:27.927
LET ME SAVE YOUR LIFE.

20:30.960 --> 20:33.363
(screams)

20:33.363 --> 20:34.964
UHH!

20:34.964 --> 20:37.907
(woman wailing)

20:44.474 --> 20:46.476
(gasping)

21:07.297 --> 21:10.500
E.M.T. SAYS HE'S STABLE. WE CAN
QUESTION HIM IN THE HOSPITAL.

21:10.500 --> 21:13.903
IT'S NOT YOUR GUN.

21:13.903 --> 21:16.776
SERIAL NUMBER
IS TOTALLY DIFFERENT.

21:16.776 --> 21:19.949
YOUR GUN'S
STILL OUT THERE.

21:19.949 --> 21:22.912
SO YOU ALMOST GOT YOURSELF
KILLED FOR NOTHING?

21:22.912 --> 21:25.485
YEAH, I GUESS SO.

21:25.485 --> 21:26.916
(exhales deeply)

21:32.592 --> 21:34.063
ALL RIGHT.

21:34.063 --> 21:36.326
YOU TOOK HIM DOWN,

21:36.326 --> 21:37.827
SAVED AN INNOCENT WOMAN.

21:37.827 --> 21:40.900
THAT'S FANTASTIC WORK.

21:40.900 --> 21:43.603
WHAT I CAN'T UNDERSTAND IS,

21:43.603 --> 21:45.935
IF YOU THOUGHT THAT GUN
WAS GONNA KILL YOU,

21:45.935 --> 21:49.439
I MEAN... COPS HAD
THE PLACE SURROUNDED.

21:49.439 --> 21:52.041
HE WAS NEVER GONNA
MAKE IT OUT OF HERE ANYWAY.

21:52.041 --> 21:54.013
THAT'S WHY I NEEDED
TO GET TO HIM, MAN--

21:54.013 --> 21:56.686
SO I COULD ASK HIM WHY.

22:01.891 --> 22:03.893
UGH.

22:05.695 --> 22:07.927
DO YOU REMEMBER...

22:07.927 --> 22:11.761
THAT SPEECH YOU GAVE
MY FIRST DAY ON THE JOB?

22:13.833 --> 22:17.537
IT WAS ALL ABOUT
BEING THE KIND OF PERSON

22:17.537 --> 22:20.410
WHO COULD BE COUNTED ON

22:20.410 --> 22:23.373
TO DO THE RIGHT THING
AT THE RIGHT TIME.

22:23.373 --> 22:26.676
AND, MAN, SINCE OCTOBER 6th,
WHEN I DIDN'T SEE ANYTHING,

22:26.676 --> 22:30.620
I HAVE HAD A LOT OF TROUBLE
BEING THAT PERSON.

22:32.922 --> 22:35.925
AND I NEED YOUR HELP.

22:35.925 --> 22:39.489
WHY?

22:39.489 --> 22:42.932
(chuckles)
I MEAN, LOOK AT ME.

22:42.932 --> 22:45.665
IF YOU THINK I'VE BEEN MAKING
GOOD CHOICES LATELY,

22:45.665 --> 22:48.768
YOU'RE CRAZIER
THAN I THOUGHT.

22:48.768 --> 22:51.100
I'LL DO ANYTHING
TO HELP YOU, DEMETRI,

22:51.100 --> 22:54.674
SO I'M GONNA
TELL YOU SOMETHING,

22:54.674 --> 22:57.577
AND I REALLY WANT YOU
TO LISTEN.

22:57.577 --> 22:59.579
GET OUT OF HERE.

22:59.579 --> 23:02.882
YOU AND ZOEY JUST
GET OUT OF HERE.

23:02.882 --> 23:04.884
(whispers)
I'M NOT RUNNING AWAY.

23:04.884 --> 23:07.657
THAT'S RIGHT. YOU'RE NOT.

23:07.657 --> 23:09.859
YOU'RE BEING SMART.

23:11.921 --> 23:14.624
JUST PROMISE ME
YOU'LL GO SOMEWHERE SAFE.

23:20.830 --> 23:24.904
(horns honk)

23:24.904 --> 23:29.078
(Zoey) SPECIAL AGENT NOH,
DO YOU RECOGNIZE EXHIBIT "H"?

23:29.078 --> 23:31.080
YES. IT'S A COPY OF MY NOTES

23:31.080 --> 23:33.483
TAKEN WHILE WITNESSING
THE TRANSACTION.

23:33.483 --> 23:37.787
AND THOSE HANDWRITTEN NOTES ARE
YOUR ONLY RECORD OF THE EVENTS?

23:37.787 --> 23:41.591
WELL, IT WAS A VERY SIMPLE
MONEY-FOR-STOLEN-GOODS EXCHANGE.

23:41.591 --> 23:44.123
HMM.

23:44.123 --> 23:46.456
WOW.

23:46.456 --> 23:48.928
THAT IS VERY GOOD.

23:48.928 --> 23:51.901
AGENT NOH,
WHO TAUGHT YOU TO DRAW?

23:51.901 --> 23:54.904
I GUESS
I'M JUST NATURALLY ARTISTIC.

23:54.904 --> 23:58.037
WOW. LUCKY GUY, RIGHT?

23:59.138 --> 24:02.071
NOW YOUR DESCRIPTION HERE

24:02.071 --> 24:05.044
OF THE ALLEGED BUYER--OH, HERE,
FURTHER DOWN IN YOUR NOTES--

24:05.044 --> 24:07.947
CAN YOU READ THAT
FOR THE COURT, PLEASE?

24:07.947 --> 24:11.821
UH, "CAUCASIAN MALE,
AVERAGE HEIGHT/WEIGHT,

24:11.821 --> 24:13.883
DARK JACKET, BASEBALL CAP."

24:13.883 --> 24:16.185
HMM.
WHEN MY CLIENT WAS BOOKED,

24:16.185 --> 24:20.059
HE WAS PHOTOGRAPHED
WEARING A RED JACKET,

24:20.059 --> 24:22.892
NOT A DARK ONE, WASN'T HE?
YES.

24:22.892 --> 24:26.566
AND HE CLEARLY HAS A GOATEE,
DOES HE NOT, AGENT NOH?

24:26.566 --> 24:30.469
YES.
SO WHICH INDIVIDUAL BOUGHT
THE STOLEN COMPUTER DISK,

24:30.469 --> 24:32.942
AGENT NOH--
THE ONE WITH THE GOATEE,

24:32.942 --> 24:34.944
OR THE ONE
IN YOUR ARTISTIC NOTES?

24:34.944 --> 24:37.877
BECAUSE THEY'RE OBVIOUSLY
NOT THE SAME PERSON.

24:37.877 --> 24:40.750
(man) OBJECTION--
ARGUMENTATIVE.
(judge) SUSTAINED.

24:40.750 --> 24:43.753
DO I GET TO ANSWER THAT?
NOT REALLY.
NO FURTHER QUESTIONS.

24:43.753 --> 24:46.085
I'M DONE WITH THIS WITNESS.

24:46.085 --> 24:48.518
OH, YOU CAN GO NOW.

24:52.061 --> 24:55.995
COME ON. THERE'S NO NEED
TO TAKE IT PERSONALLY.

24:55.995 --> 24:58.227
THAT WAS A WIN THAT YOU
JUST TURNED INTO A LOSS.

24:58.227 --> 25:02.501
(chuckles) IT WAS NEVER REALLY
A WIN, BECAUSE YOU WERE WRONG.
WOW. YOU KNOW WHAT?

25:02.501 --> 25:04.904
UM, I'M GONNA GO AHEAD
AND TAKE THE STAIRS.
YOU KNOW WHAT?

25:04.904 --> 25:07.977
LOOK, I'M--I'M SORRY. I WILL
TURN THE DEFENSE ATTORNEY OFF.

25:07.977 --> 25:10.980
OKAY, THAT WOULD BE
AN INSTANT IMPROVEMENT.

25:10.980 --> 25:13.613
WHY DON'T YOU LET ME
MAKE IT UP TO YOU?

25:13.613 --> 25:16.145
CAN I...
TAKE YOU TO DINNER?

25:16.145 --> 25:18.217
HA!
YOU GOTTA BE KIDDING ME.

25:18.217 --> 25:20.089
WHAT?

25:20.089 --> 25:23.092
THERE'S NOT A CHANCE IN HELL
I WOULD EVER GO OUT WITH YOU.

25:26.956 --> 25:29.228
(plate scrapes)

25:33.633 --> 25:34.934
HEY.
(silverware clinking)

25:34.934 --> 25:37.567
HEY.

25:37.567 --> 25:39.569
HOW ARE YOU?

25:39.569 --> 25:40.970
(kisses) GOOD.

25:40.970 --> 25:44.273
SIT DOWN.
I WANT TO TALK TO YOU.

25:44.273 --> 25:47.146
IT'S OKAY.

25:47.146 --> 25:49.919
WOW. YOU'RE BEAUTIFUL.

25:49.919 --> 25:53.052
SHUT UP.

25:53.052 --> 25:55.855
WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU?

25:55.855 --> 25:58.327
NOTHING.
(claps hands)

25:58.327 --> 26:00.059
IT'S GOOD.

26:00.059 --> 26:03.162
YOU KNOW, I WASN'T SUPPOSED
TO BE THERE THAT DAY.

26:03.162 --> 26:05.564
WHAT DAY?

26:05.564 --> 26:07.867
AL GOUGH WAS SUPPOSED
TO BE MARK'S PARTNER.

26:07.867 --> 26:10.700
I SWITCHED WITH HIM, AND BECAUSE
I WAS MARK'S PARTNER,

26:10.700 --> 26:13.943
I WAS COVERING THE BUST
THAT LED ME TO YOU.

26:13.943 --> 26:16.806
ALL THESE TINY LITTLE DECISIONS
WE MAKE, YOU KNOW,

26:16.806 --> 26:18.808
WITHOUT THINKING,
THEY--THEY ALL--

26:18.808 --> 26:22.581
THEY ALL LINE UP
TO LEAD US SOMEWHERE...

26:22.581 --> 26:25.314
SOMEWHERE GOOD.
YEAH.

26:25.314 --> 26:28.618
SO I WANT TO ASK YOU
IF YOU WILL...

26:28.618 --> 26:31.020
MARRY ME.

26:31.020 --> 26:34.093
(laughs)
BABY, WE COVERED THIS.

26:34.093 --> 26:36.065
I-I SAID YEAH.

26:36.065 --> 26:38.928
NO, I WANT TO GET MARRIED
RIGHT NOW.
OKAY.

26:38.928 --> 26:40.129
I WANT TO GET
MARRIED TOMORROW.

26:40.129 --> 26:42.702
THEN WE GET ON A PLANE
AND WE GO TO HAWAII.

26:42.702 --> 26:46.836
WE STAY THERE THROUGH THE 15th,
MAYBE THROUGH APRIL 29th.

26:46.836 --> 26:49.178
LISTEN,
MAYBE WE DON'T EVER COME HOME.

26:49.178 --> 26:52.081
WANT TO DO IT?
ARE YOU SERIOUS?

26:52.081 --> 26:54.744
I'M SERIOUS.
HELL, YES!

26:54.744 --> 26:56.015
YES?

26:56.015 --> 26:59.919
OF COURSE!
OH, I LOVE YOU. MM.

26:59.919 --> 27:03.022
(dogs barking in distance)

27:03.022 --> 27:06.025
(knocks on door)

27:08.027 --> 27:09.228
HEY.

27:09.228 --> 27:11.260
HI.

27:13.062 --> 27:17.236
I--SORRY. I JUST WANTED
TO COME BY AND SAY THANKS

27:17.236 --> 27:20.339
FOR WHAT YOU DID WITH CHARLIE
TODAY IN THE PARK.

27:20.339 --> 27:22.772
OKAY, UM...

27:22.772 --> 27:24.914
NO PROBLEM.

27:24.914 --> 27:28.017
WELL, THANK YOU.

27:28.017 --> 27:30.980
CAN I--
CAN I GET YOU TO COME IN?

27:30.980 --> 27:34.383
I JUST LEFT THE WATER RUNNING,
BUT PLEASE, PLEASE COME IN.

27:36.425 --> 27:38.257
SURE.

27:42.061 --> 27:45.134
(door closes)
I'M SORRY. THE DISHES WERE
GETTING KIND OF OUT OF CONTROL.

27:45.134 --> 27:47.136
CAN I GET YOU
SOMETHING TO DRINK?

27:47.136 --> 27:50.800
UM, I COULD OFFER YOU A CARTON
OF MILK THAT EXPIRED YESTERDAY,

27:50.800 --> 27:53.672
SOME JUICE BOXES
OR A BOTTLE OF GIN.

27:57.076 --> 27:59.078
NO.

27:59.078 --> 28:02.952
NO, I THINK I--
I THINK I SHOULD BE GOING.

28:02.952 --> 28:05.154
REALLY?

28:05.154 --> 28:07.186
YEAH.
THANK YOU FOR TODAY.

28:07.186 --> 28:10.720
YEAH, I DO HAVE A TELEPHONE.

28:10.720 --> 28:13.462
YOU COULD'VE CALLED
TO SAY THANK YOU.

28:13.462 --> 28:16.295
OLIVIA...

28:16.295 --> 28:19.128
WHY ARE YOU HERE?

28:32.982 --> 28:37.486
I DON'T KNOW. I'VE JUST MADE
SUCH A MESS OF THINGS.

28:37.486 --> 28:41.791
I WISH I COULD BLAME IT ALL
ON MARK, BUT I REALLY CAN'T.

28:41.791 --> 28:45.194
I MADE A TON OF MISTAKES.

28:47.096 --> 28:50.760
I KNOW THAT FEELING.

28:50.760 --> 28:54.063
I TRIED MY BEST WITH LINDA
AFTER DYLAN WAS BORN,

28:54.063 --> 28:57.006
BUT... (sighs)

28:57.006 --> 29:00.039
TO BE HONEST,
I-I USED HIS AUTISM

29:00.039 --> 29:02.411
AS AN EXCUSE
TO GET AWAY FROM HER.

29:02.411 --> 29:06.345
EVEN THE THOUGHT OF THAT
MAKES ME ASHAMED NOW.

29:06.345 --> 29:09.478
I THOUGHT I WAS DOING
THE RIGHT THING AT THE TIME.

29:09.478 --> 29:11.480
YOU'RE DAMNED IF YOU DO,

29:11.480 --> 29:13.983
AND THEN YOU'RE DAMNED
IF YOU DON'T.

29:13.983 --> 29:16.455
YEAH, MAYBE WE JUST...

29:16.455 --> 29:18.487
CHOOSE TO LIVE
IN THE MOMENT,

29:18.487 --> 29:22.091
YOU KNOW, JUST GRAB THE...

29:22.091 --> 29:24.994
GOOD THINGS IN OUR LIFE
WHEN WE RECOGNIZE THEM.

29:26.495 --> 29:28.497
I HAVE TO GO.

29:28.497 --> 29:31.500
LOOK. WAIT.

29:31.500 --> 29:34.103
I'M NOT TRYING
TO ARGUE AGAINST MARK.

29:34.103 --> 29:38.277
HE'S A BRAVE MAN DOING
SOMETHING EXTRAORDINARY.

29:38.277 --> 29:40.249
YEAH, HE IS.

29:40.249 --> 29:43.082
(sighs)

29:43.082 --> 29:45.084
THIS DOES KIND OF PUT ME

29:45.084 --> 29:48.517
IN THE LANCELOT-TRYING-TO-
PERSUADE-GUINEVERE POSITION.

29:48.517 --> 29:51.790
OH, YOU DID NOT JUST COMPARE
YOURSELF TO LANCELOT. (chuckles)

29:51.790 --> 29:54.463
(chuckles) YEAH, WELL,
THE ONLY OTHER METAPHOR I HAD

29:54.463 --> 29:57.126
INVOLVED PROTONS AND NEUTRONS,
AND BELIEVE ME,

29:57.126 --> 30:01.100
UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES,
I WENT WITH THE STRONGER CHOICE.

30:01.100 --> 30:05.804
I KNOW THAT WE'RE FEELING
THE SAME THING RIGHT NOW.

30:05.804 --> 30:09.578
(lowers voice) HOW DO YOU KNOW
WHAT I'M FEELING?

30:09.578 --> 30:13.913
BECAUSE I'M IN THAT ROOM
ON APRIL THE 29th.

30:17.046 --> 30:19.118
THAT WASN'T AN ACCIDENT.

30:21.220 --> 30:24.323
(whoosh)

30:24.323 --> 30:26.255
(whoosh)

30:26.255 --> 30:28.527
(whispers)
THIS SCARES ME.

30:28.527 --> 30:32.001
IT SHOULD.

30:47.977 --> 30:50.379
WHO THE HELL ARE YOU?

30:52.451 --> 30:54.223
IT'S OKAY, AARON.

30:54.223 --> 30:56.585
I WORK WITH MARK.

30:56.585 --> 30:59.428
I'M A FRIEND.

30:59.428 --> 31:02.131
(horn honks)

31:02.131 --> 31:04.863
YOU MIND TELLING ME
HOW YOU FOUND ME?

31:04.863 --> 31:07.336
THERE WAS A COMPUTER
IN ECHO PARK DOING WEB SEARCHES

31:07.336 --> 31:09.638
FOR A "JERICHO
PARWAN AFGHANISTAN,"

31:09.638 --> 31:11.540
"JERICHO CENTRAL BASE"

31:11.540 --> 31:15.644
AND "JERICHO MURDER
U.S. SOLDIERS."
THAT LIBRARY'S
2 MILES FROM HERE.

31:15.644 --> 31:19.308
AND THIS IS THE 14th
CASH-ONLY HOTEL I'VE HIT.

31:19.308 --> 31:22.081
WELL, HERE I AM.
NOW WHAT?

31:22.081 --> 31:24.083
MARK DIDN'T WANT
TO TELL ME WHY

31:24.083 --> 31:28.017
YOU WERE SO INTERESTED
IN JERICHO.

31:28.017 --> 31:31.090
BUT SOME VERY POWERFUL PEOPLE
WOULD LOVE TO TAKE THEM DOWN.

31:31.090 --> 31:34.123
ALL THEY NEED IS PROOF.

31:34.123 --> 31:36.165
THEY GOT MY DAUGHTER.

31:36.165 --> 31:39.368
THEY KILL HER?
THEY TRIED.
SHE'S STILL ALIVE.

31:39.368 --> 31:42.031
BUT IN YOUR FILE IT--
TRACY'S ALIVE.

31:42.031 --> 31:45.074
SHE WAS HERE,
BUT JERICHO FOUND HER

31:45.074 --> 31:47.236
AND TOOK HER BACK
TO AFGHANISTAN.

31:47.236 --> 31:50.179
I GOTTA BELIEVE I'VE ONLY GOT
SO MUCH TIME LEFT TO FIND HER.

31:50.179 --> 31:53.112
WAIT. YOU'RE--YOU'RE--
YOU'RE GOING TO AFGHANISTAN?
SURE AM.

31:53.112 --> 31:55.985
I KNOW YOU WERE
IN THE SERVICE AND EVERYTHING,

31:55.985 --> 31:57.216
BUT HOW ARE YOU PLANNING
ON GETTING THERE?

31:57.216 --> 31:59.188
FLY INTO UZBEKISTAN,
CROSS THE BORDER AT TERMEZ.

31:59.188 --> 32:03.152
AND YOU'RE DOING THIS
WITH A U.S. PASSPORT?

32:03.152 --> 32:06.355
YEAH.
YOU'LL BE DEAD
BEFORE YOU LEAVE HAIRATON.

32:06.355 --> 32:09.198
I DON'T HAVE A CHOICE.

32:11.000 --> 32:14.003
DO YOU KNOW WHY JERICHO
TRIED TO KILL YOUR DAUGHTER

32:14.003 --> 32:16.105
TWO YEARS AGO?

32:19.969 --> 32:23.172
SHE SAW JERICHO
WIPE OUT AN ENTIRE VILLAGE.

32:25.544 --> 32:29.248
IF I COULD HELP YOU
GET TO TRACY...

32:29.248 --> 32:32.421
DO YOU THINK SHE WOULD
TELL US THE WHOLE STORY?

32:32.421 --> 32:34.423
(sighs)

32:39.688 --> 32:43.362
(Janice) REALLY?
YOU CAN DO THAT LEGALLY?

32:43.362 --> 32:46.695
HEY, DEMETRI. COME HERE.
WHAT?

32:46.695 --> 32:48.297
COME HERE.

32:48.297 --> 32:52.041
YO, I'M GETTING MARRIED.
(chuckles) COME HERE.

32:52.041 --> 32:55.744
I'M GETTING MARRIED.
SO WOULD YOU BE OKAY
WITH VREEDE OFFICIATING

32:55.744 --> 32:59.148
AT YOUR WEDDING?
DEFINE "OKAY."

32:59.148 --> 33:02.151
NO CHARGE. (chuckles)

33:02.151 --> 33:05.554
CONSIDER IT
MY WEDDING GIFT.

33:05.554 --> 33:07.556
WHOA. YOU'RE GONNA MARRY HIM?

33:07.556 --> 33:09.258
(Janis)
VREEDE'S AN INTERNET MINISTER.

33:09.258 --> 33:12.121
HAVE I EVER TOLD YOU HOW
AWESOME YOU ARE, SHELLY VREEDE?

33:12.121 --> 33:15.124
(Janis) OHH.
YOU MAKE ME FEEL AWESOME.

33:15.124 --> 33:16.325
JANIS, YOU'RE AWESOME, TOO.

33:16.325 --> 33:18.467
OH, THANK YOU.
JANIS IS AWESOME.

33:18.467 --> 33:21.070
THAT'S VERY SWEET. THANK YOU.

33:21.070 --> 33:23.402
(Vreede) ALL RIGHT.
MARK IS AWESOME.

33:23.402 --> 33:26.175
TIME TO TAKE THE GROOM HOME.
ALL RIGHT.
YEAH. LET'S FIND A CAB.

33:26.175 --> 33:28.177
HERE WE GO, BUDDY.
ALL RIGHT.

33:28.177 --> 33:30.008
OH. OKAY, I'M SLEEPY.

33:30.008 --> 33:32.081
(Janis) YEAH.
GOOD NIGHT.

33:36.145 --> 33:38.147
YOU GOT
MILITARY CLEARANCE.

33:38.147 --> 33:40.149
YOUR COVER IS
YOU'RE IN AFGHANISTAN

33:40.149 --> 33:42.151
TO HELP INSTALL
THEIR POWER GRID.

33:43.452 --> 33:45.154
(beep)

33:45.154 --> 33:46.625
SATELLITE PHONE.

33:46.625 --> 33:49.728
VIDEO CAPABILITY. AS SOON AS YOU
CAN DOCUMENT WHAT TRACY KNOWS,

33:49.728 --> 33:53.202
I WANT IT UPLOADED.
IF YOU SEE ANY JERICHO ACTIVITY,

33:53.202 --> 33:55.134
I WANT IT UPLOADED--
PICTURES, VIDEO, AUDIO,

33:55.134 --> 33:57.306
ANYTHING YOU CAN GET ME.
NO PROBLEM.

33:57.306 --> 33:59.308
GET YOURSELF TO BAGRAM
AS SOON AS YOU'RE CLEAR.

33:59.308 --> 34:01.670
MILITARY TRANSPORTS LEAVE
EVERY TWO DAYS.

34:01.670 --> 34:04.673
I'LL ARRANGE A FLIGHT HOME.
EXCELLENT.

34:04.673 --> 34:06.815
I'M GUESSING...

34:06.815 --> 34:10.579
YOU DON'T NEED ME TO TELL YOU
WHAT TO DO WITH THESE.

34:10.579 --> 34:13.482
I GOT A COUPLE IDEAS.

34:13.482 --> 34:15.654
AH, ALL THIS GEAR IS CLEAN.

34:15.654 --> 34:19.128
NONE OF IT CAN BE TRACED
BACK TO THIS AGENCY.

34:19.128 --> 34:22.161
IF THEY FIND YOU...

34:22.161 --> 34:23.492
YOU'RE ON YOUR OWN.

34:23.492 --> 34:26.695
IS THAT IT?

34:26.695 --> 34:29.067
I GUESS IT IS.

34:29.067 --> 34:31.240
THANK YOU, STAN.

34:31.240 --> 34:33.672
THIS ISN'T SOMETHING
I THINK I NEED TO TELL YOU,

34:33.672 --> 34:38.307
BUT THERE'S A VERY GOOD CHANCE
YOU'RE NEVER COMING BACK.
I SAW MYSELF WITH MY DAUGHTER.

34:38.307 --> 34:40.409
(whoosh)
WE WERE TOGETHER IN AFGHANISTAN,

34:40.409 --> 34:42.251
AND SHE WAS ALIVE.

34:42.251 --> 34:45.114
GOD HELP ANYONE
WHO STANDS IN MY WAY.

34:51.089 --> 34:55.194
DO YOU THINK I'M CHICKEN
FOR RUNNING AWAY?

34:55.194 --> 34:56.725
(chuckles)

34:56.725 --> 35:00.499
SOMETIMES THE BEST OFFENSE
IS A GOOD DEFENSE.

35:00.499 --> 35:01.770
(chuckles)

35:01.770 --> 35:05.474
NO, JANIS,
I'M JUST SCARED.

35:05.474 --> 35:08.437
YOU PLAYED THIS OUT
AS BEST AS YOU COULD.

35:08.437 --> 35:12.141
EVERYBODY NEEDS
A SUCCESSFUL EXIT STRATEGY.

35:12.141 --> 35:14.213
THIS IS YOURS.

35:17.516 --> 35:19.488
(groans)

35:19.488 --> 35:22.120
HEY, UM...

35:22.120 --> 35:25.754
(chuckles)
I WANT YOU TO KNOW, UM...

35:25.754 --> 35:27.756
THAT NIGHT IN SOMALIA--

35:27.756 --> 35:31.129
OH, DEMETRI, DON'T.
NO, I WANT TO. I-I HAVE TO--

35:31.129 --> 35:32.231
STOP.

35:32.231 --> 35:34.163
JUST STOP.

35:34.163 --> 35:36.305
NO, UH, THIS MAY BE
MY LAST CHANCE, ALL RIGHT?

35:36.305 --> 35:38.837
I'M PREGNANT.

35:38.837 --> 35:41.210
WHAT?

35:41.210 --> 35:42.841
(engine starts)

35:42.841 --> 35:44.273
(taps roof)

35:44.273 --> 35:46.775
JANIS.

35:46.775 --> 35:47.876
JANIS!

35:59.358 --> 36:01.730
(Zoey) OH, MY GOSH.
THIS IS PERFECT.

36:01.730 --> 36:03.892
MY MOM IS GONNA BE
SO EXCITED.

36:03.892 --> 36:06.235
WELL, I'M HAPPY
TO LET YOU USE THE SPACE,

36:06.235 --> 36:08.667
BUT SINCE
YOU AREN'T MEMBERS HERE,

36:08.667 --> 36:12.941
AND, UH, SINCE WE DIDN'T DO
ANY PREMARITAL COUNSELING--

36:12.941 --> 36:15.304
OH, WE DON'T NEED
ANY PREMARITAL COUNSELING.

36:15.304 --> 36:18.707
WE'VE BEEN LIVING TOGETHER
FOR A YEAR.
I'M GOING TO PRETEND
I DIDN'T HEAR THAT.

36:18.707 --> 36:22.381
LISTEN, YOU, UH, NEED
TO GET MARRIED THIS AFTERNOON--

36:22.381 --> 36:25.214
FINE. BUT UNDER
THESE CIRCUMSTANCES,

36:25.214 --> 36:27.516
YOU'RE GOING TO NEED
TO FIND SOMEBODY ELSE

36:27.516 --> 36:29.958
TO OFFICIATE FOR YOU.

36:36.895 --> 36:39.298
HEY, I NEVER HEARD.
DID YOU, UH, TRACK DOWN AARON?

36:39.298 --> 36:41.700
I GUESS HE DIDN'T
WANT TO BE FOUND.

36:43.732 --> 36:46.235
GUYS, YOU GOTTA SEE THIS.

36:46.235 --> 36:47.776
IT'S FROST.

36:47.776 --> 36:50.979
YOU FOUND HIM?
HIS PHONE WAS ACTIVATED
12 DAYS AGO

36:50.979 --> 36:52.711
AT A CONVENIENCE STORE

36:52.711 --> 36:55.914
ON THE CORNER OF WESTERN
AND WASHINGTON--3:18 P.M.
(taps button)

36:55.914 --> 36:59.688
3:19, A MAN FITTING
FROST'S DESCRIPTION

36:59.688 --> 37:03.592
WALKS TO
A 1971 CITROEN DS SEDAN--

37:03.592 --> 37:05.394
POWDER BLUE, SILVER TOP.

37:07.996 --> 37:09.458
A MATCH FROM THE SHELTER.

37:09.458 --> 37:11.330
MM-HMM.
WAIT A MINUTE.

37:11.330 --> 37:14.303
DYSON FROST MADE A VIDEOTAPE
FOR YOU 19 YEARS AGO,

37:14.303 --> 37:16.305
THEN ENCODED A PHONE NUMBER
FOR YOU TO FIND.

37:16.305 --> 37:18.937
AND THEN AFTER ALL THAT,
INSTEAD OF MEETING WITH YOU,

37:18.937 --> 37:21.870
HE'S MURDERING A HOMELESS GUY?

37:21.870 --> 37:23.772
BUT HE USED MY GUN
TO DO IT.

37:23.772 --> 37:26.615
HE MAY BE CRAZY,
BUT HE ISN'T RANDOM.

37:26.615 --> 37:28.877
THERE'S A METHOD HERE.

37:28.877 --> 37:33.382
WE JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHAT IT IS YET.

37:38.787 --> 37:41.490
â™ª ISLANDS IN THE STREAM â™ª

37:41.490 --> 37:43.932
â™ª THAT IS WHAT WE ARE â™ª

37:43.932 --> 37:46.465
â™ª NO ONE IN BETWEEN â™ª

37:46.465 --> 37:48.467
â™ª AH, AH â™ª

37:57.906 --> 38:00.278
(violin playing)
ANY WORD FROM THE L.A.P.D.

38:00.278 --> 38:02.280
ON THE SEARCH
FOR FROST'S VEHICLE?

38:02.280 --> 38:05.053
STILL LOOKING.
I'LL STAY ON TOP OF IT.
WELL, LET'S KEEP
PUTTING THE PRESSURE ON.

38:05.053 --> 38:07.856
I MEAN, I REALLY--
GUYS, CAN WE STOP
WITH THE SHOPTALK?

38:07.856 --> 38:10.819
THIS IS A SPECIAL OCCASION.
IT'S JUST LIKE DEMETRI TO BE
LATE FOR HIS OWN WEDDING.

38:10.819 --> 38:12.861
HE'S NOT ANSWERING HIS CELL.

38:12.861 --> 38:14.863
I CALLED THREE TIMES.

38:14.863 --> 38:17.866
LET ME TRY.
(speed-dials)

38:17.866 --> 38:20.899
(cell phone rings)

38:20.899 --> 38:23.031
(ring)

38:23.031 --> 38:25.033
(beep)
(Demetri)
Demetri Noh. Leave a message.

38:25.033 --> 38:26.835
NOTHING.
WHAT IS IT?

38:26.835 --> 38:28.837
(beep)
GUYS, WHERE IS HE?

38:36.785 --> 38:39.087
(woman over P.A.) ...TICKET
BOOTH RIGHT BY THE ENTRANCE.

38:39.087 --> 38:41.390
(continues indistinctly)

38:43.622 --> 38:46.625
(carnival music playing)

39:00.709 --> 39:03.011
DON'T FORGET TO BUY
YOUR RAFFLE TICKETS...

39:03.011 --> 39:06.575
(bell ringing)

39:06.575 --> 39:09.448
(man) CORN DOGS!
EVERY PENNY GOES TO THE SCHOOL!
(Charlie) GET SOME COTTON CANDY!

39:09.448 --> 39:11.780
HEY, SWEETIE.
(Charlie) HI, MOM!

39:11.780 --> 39:13.782
HEY, STEP RIGHT UP,
LADIES AND GENTS.

39:13.782 --> 39:17.025
WHEEL OF FORTUNE--
ONE SPIN FOR THREE TICKETS.

39:17.025 --> 39:20.529
YOU WANT TO GIVE ME?
ROUND AND ROUND SHE GOES,

39:20.529 --> 39:25.033
AND WHERE SHE STOPS,
NOBODY KNOWS.
(cell phone rings)

39:25.033 --> 39:26.535
(ring)

39:26.535 --> 39:29.097
UH...
(ring, beep)

39:29.097 --> 39:30.769
(normal voice) HEY.

39:30.769 --> 39:32.471
HEY. WHERE ARE YOU?

39:32.471 --> 39:34.142
UH, SCHOOL, UH, CARNIVAL.

39:34.142 --> 39:37.145
WELL, LISTEN, I'M CALLING
BECAUSE I'M NOT GONNA MAKE IT.

39:37.145 --> 39:40.509
I NEED YOU TO KEEP CHARLIE.
OH. HOW COME?

39:40.509 --> 39:43.752
SOMETHING'S HAPPENED
TO DEMETRI.
WHAT?

39:43.752 --> 39:45.754
NOT SURE WHAT IT IS YET.

39:45.754 --> 39:48.056
HE DIDN'T SHOW UP
AT THE WEDDING.

39:48.056 --> 39:50.058
I just thought
you should know.

39:50.058 --> 39:52.591
WOW.
WHAT DO YOU THINK HAPPENED?
I don't know.
I hope it's just cold feet,

39:52.591 --> 39:54.593
BECAUSE IT'S ALMOST MARCH 15th,

39:54.593 --> 39:57.095
AND THIS IS TOO CLOSE
FOR COMFORT.

39:57.095 --> 39:58.897
Olivia?
YEAH?

39:58.897 --> 40:01.700
BE CAREFUL.

40:01.700 --> 40:02.931
OF COURSE.

40:02.931 --> 40:04.132
KISS CHARLIE FOR ME.

40:04.132 --> 40:05.974
I WILL.

40:05.974 --> 40:07.806
(beep)

40:07.806 --> 40:10.038
(beep)
UH, HANG ON, KIDS.

40:10.038 --> 40:12.611
UH...

40:14.683 --> 40:16.915
CHARLIE!

40:16.915 --> 40:19.548
CHARLIE!

40:28.096 --> 40:30.428
HELLO, CHARLIE.
