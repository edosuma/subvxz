00:01.698 --> 00:04.459
I've got a screw we can use. You
get it and they'll bring it in.

00:04.539 --> 00:05.539
Give it to me.

00:05.979 --> 00:08.579
I asked you to start a small
fight that I could handle.

00:08.659 --> 00:10.499
How easily a fight turns into a riot.

00:12.499 --> 00:15.299
Meg? Oh, no, no, no, no.

00:15.779 --> 00:18.619
When they buried her, they gave me
her wedding ring, but no bracelet.

00:18.699 --> 00:20.739
Whoever killed Meg took that bracelet.

00:21.339 --> 00:23.099
You're stronger with Bea than without her.

00:23.179 --> 00:24.899
And a smart girl like you should know that.

00:28.059 --> 00:29.339
Can you please go now?

00:29.419 --> 00:31.019
Do you think you could
let me make it up to you?

00:31.379 --> 00:32.619
Could I have a bit of time?

00:32.939 --> 00:36.899
Last night, your husband found
Debbie in her bedroom unconscious.

00:37.299 --> 00:38.659
I'm sorry, Bea, they were too late.

00:39.139 --> 00:40.979
Debbie was making up notes from me.

00:41.059 --> 00:44.099
And then I find out she was
lying about staying at Matilda's.

00:44.179 --> 00:46.179
She was staying at some boyfriend's place.

00:46.259 --> 00:48.419
- She had a boyfriend?
- Yeah. Brayden.

01:46.299 --> 01:48.179
I just wish she'd told
me what was going on.

01:49.299 --> 01:51.819
I wish she'd just talked to me. I
should have asked more questions.

01:51.899 --> 01:54.059
Yeah, but teenagers keep secrets.

01:54.979 --> 01:56.179
She had a boyfriend.

01:56.259 --> 01:58.659
I just keep wondering if he was
the one that got her into the drugs.

02:01.619 --> 02:03.139
You're never gonna know what she was up to.

02:03.219 --> 02:04.899
Kids are into all sorts of stuff now.

02:04.979 --> 02:06.099
Yeah, but heroin?

02:06.739 --> 02:10.299
Harry had no idea. He'd never
even heard of this Brayden kid.

02:14.979 --> 02:16.099
What?

02:17.579 --> 02:18.939
Jacs' son.

02:20.179 --> 02:21.379
His name's Brayden.

02:23.139 --> 02:25.099
Yeah, well, that could be a coincidence.

02:26.299 --> 02:27.419
You reckon?

02:35.019 --> 02:36.299
Bea!

02:36.379 --> 02:37.459
Get off me!

02:37.779 --> 02:39.859
- What are you doing?
- Let's take this outside.

02:39.939 --> 02:41.379
- Bea, now.
- What are you doing?

02:42.739 --> 02:43.739
Come on.

02:46.619 --> 02:47.979
Look, I know things are
difficult at the moment

02:48.059 --> 02:49.739
but you don't just go
around attacking other women.

02:49.819 --> 02:51.259
- I didn't. I didn't.
- Oh, come on!

02:51.339 --> 02:53.059
All right. Okay, whatever happened,

02:53.139 --> 02:55.019
if it happens again,
you're both in the slot.

02:59.059 --> 03:01.339
01 calling 03. Over.

03:03.419 --> 03:05.619
- No, no, no, don't.
- She did this.

03:05.699 --> 03:07.979
- She did this.
- You do not know that for sure.

03:08.499 --> 03:11.619
You have to find out the truth
and there is only one way to do it.

03:11.979 --> 03:13.979
Hey? You know that.

03:15.899 --> 03:18.539
Mr. Jackson, I need to
speak to the Governor now.

03:26.139 --> 03:27.659
Yeah?

03:28.299 --> 03:29.539
Bea Smith, Governor.

03:29.619 --> 03:31.579
- Bea.
- Jacs killed Debbie.

03:31.819 --> 03:33.859
It was Jacs. It had to be.

03:33.939 --> 03:36.899
- We need to talk to the police.
- Okay, calm down. I don't understand.

03:36.979 --> 03:38.899
Jacs' son Brayden. Debbie was seeing him.

03:38.979 --> 03:41.299
It wasn't an accident, Jacs
is responsible for this.

03:41.739 --> 03:44.899
Right, can you just take a seat?
We'll be fine. Thank you, Mr. Jackson.

03:46.019 --> 03:49.419
Debbie was going to nightclubs, she...
She was taking drugs, it wasn't like her.

03:49.819 --> 03:51.699
She started seeing this kid, Brayden.

03:51.779 --> 03:54.259
Jacs had Debbie killed. We
have to talk to the police.

03:54.339 --> 03:55.939
Why do you think it was Jacs?

03:57.539 --> 04:00.659
She knew where we lived.
She'd threatened Debbie before.

04:00.739 --> 04:02.859
She told me she'd have her
run down outside her school.

04:03.099 --> 04:05.579
She knew Debbie's routine. Now I know how.

04:05.659 --> 04:07.939
- It was Brayden.
- And why would she hurt Debbie?

04:09.099 --> 04:10.339
She thinks I'm a threat.

04:11.739 --> 04:13.499
Will you talk to the police?

04:13.819 --> 04:14.979
Look, I understand that you want answers...

04:15.059 --> 04:17.019
Are you gonna talk to
the police or should I?

04:17.899 --> 04:19.259
I will speak to them.

04:21.418 --> 04:22.419
Thank you.

04:23.979 --> 04:25.739
I should put you into protection.

04:26.739 --> 04:27.779
Why?

04:27.859 --> 04:29.899
Just you here, talking to
me, it puts you at risk.

04:29.979 --> 04:32.619
- No, no, I'm fine.
- And what about when you run into Jacs?

04:32.699 --> 04:34.019
How will you deal with that?

04:34.619 --> 04:36.259
I just want to do this right.

04:48.859 --> 04:50.219
You should have stopped
her going to the Governor.

04:50.779 --> 04:52.339
We don't know that that's where she's gone.

04:52.699 --> 04:55.099
- You were there.
- No, Bea'd know better than to lag.

04:56.299 --> 04:58.099
- She wouldn't do it.
- Yeah, Doreen is right.

04:58.179 --> 04:59.899
The Governor's gonna talk to the police.

05:00.779 --> 05:01.899
Will she?

05:05.179 --> 05:06.619
You know what they do to laggers, Red?

05:06.899 --> 05:07.979
You don't have a say in this.

05:08.579 --> 05:10.739
The only way this works
is if you follow my lead.

05:10.819 --> 05:12.139
- This isn't about you.
- Yeah, you're right.

05:12.219 --> 05:13.419
This could hurt all of us.

05:13.899 --> 05:15.939
So you wanna deal with
Jacs, you deal with her.

05:18.099 --> 05:19.459
The police will handle it.

05:28.699 --> 05:30.539
This is an extraordinary situation.

05:31.859 --> 05:34.619
A mother has lost a child.
I'd call that tragic.

05:35.819 --> 05:37.979
Were you aware that your
son was seeing Debbie?

05:38.059 --> 05:39.179
Yes.

05:39.539 --> 05:41.259
Did you encourage him to see her?

05:41.979 --> 05:44.459
The two of them met the
first time Debbie visited Bea.

05:45.299 --> 05:47.139
Brayden told me he was seeing someone.

05:47.219 --> 05:49.579
I didn't realize till recently who it was.

05:50.579 --> 05:51.859
I heard how Debbie died.

05:52.779 --> 05:54.699
Brayden dabbled in things
too that worried me.

05:55.379 --> 05:57.379
What? Drugs?

05:57.459 --> 06:00.179
It could have just as easily
been him and thank God it wasn't.

06:01.659 --> 06:04.099
What Bea's going through, no mother should.

06:04.579 --> 06:05.699
Mmm.

06:08.499 --> 06:10.979
Bea has a lot of support in here now.

06:12.459 --> 06:13.659
And you don't.

06:15.819 --> 06:18.179
The women are aware of what's
happened with your husband.

06:18.739 --> 06:21.259
You don't have the same backing
on the outside as you used to.

06:21.739 --> 06:24.139
So, regardless of the outcome
of the police investigation

06:24.219 --> 06:27.019
into Debbie's death, you are vulnerable.

06:28.339 --> 06:30.939
My offer of moving you into
protection still stands.

06:31.379 --> 06:32.659
You should take it.

06:35.059 --> 06:36.579
I'm not responsible for this.

06:41.579 --> 06:42.779
You all right?

06:44.299 --> 06:45.419
You not hungry?

06:45.739 --> 06:46.819
No.

07:10.579 --> 07:13.139
My son wanted me to
pass on his condolences.

07:31.739 --> 07:33.059
Now's your chance.

07:46.619 --> 07:48.259
- No, no, Bea!
- Let her go.

07:53.539 --> 07:54.699
How's your arthritis?

07:56.339 --> 07:58.139
Can't be easy with that cast on.

08:00.939 --> 08:02.059
Here.

08:12.539 --> 08:14.739
Fancy a cup of tea? I know how you like it.

08:16.139 --> 08:17.539
I don't feel like one today.

08:19.059 --> 08:20.539
Well, let me help you with this tray then.

08:39.259 --> 08:41.979
Grief can make you see a lot of
things that aren't there, Bea.

08:44.939 --> 08:47.419
Oh, I can see perfectly what's going on.

08:47.979 --> 08:49.739
Just like everybody else here.

09:11.859 --> 09:16.099
Bea? What were you thinking
provoking Jacs like that?

09:16.539 --> 09:18.699
- What was I thinking?
- Yeah, 'cause it was bloody stupid...

09:18.779 --> 09:20.499
I was thinking about my little girl.

09:22.139 --> 09:25.579
Did she suffer? Was she... Was she scared?

09:25.659 --> 09:27.259
Did she know what was happening to her?

09:28.019 --> 09:30.499
I was thinking, where
was I when she needed me?

09:31.219 --> 09:32.459
That's what I was thinking.

09:35.699 --> 09:37.779
Please, just don't give me shit today.

09:38.859 --> 09:39.939
Okay.

09:43.979 --> 09:45.059
Bea.

09:48.859 --> 09:51.339
- Get out.
- Now's not a good time.

09:52.299 --> 09:53.419
You lagged.

09:53.499 --> 09:55.299
- I said get the fuck out!
- Bea.

09:56.219 --> 09:59.419
But I understand as a mother driven
by grief you're not thinking right.

09:59.499 --> 10:01.179
Oh, you're gonna pay for what you've done.

10:01.259 --> 10:04.099
And as a mother, you'll understand
me wanting to defend my boy

10:04.179 --> 10:06.099
for being accused of
something he didn't do.

10:06.179 --> 10:08.099
Oh, you threaten my
daughter and then she dies

10:08.179 --> 10:10.539
and you're telling me it's a coincidence?

10:10.619 --> 10:12.859
You just say these things
to keep the women in line.

10:12.939 --> 10:16.179
Look, whatever it is,
my boy didn't do this.

10:16.939 --> 10:18.179
You're a liar.

10:18.819 --> 10:20.099
Brayden had girlfriends before

10:20.179 --> 10:22.259
but he never spoke of any of
them like he did your girl.

10:23.579 --> 10:25.339
So, you knew that he was seeing her?

10:25.579 --> 10:26.779
I knew she was different.

10:27.939 --> 10:30.539
His face used to light up, he
couldn't stop talking about her.

10:31.339 --> 10:32.859
Brayden loved Debbie.

10:33.099 --> 10:34.499
He could never harm her.

10:34.899 --> 10:36.979
She was obviously a very special kid.

10:37.619 --> 10:38.819
And so is Brayden.

10:39.339 --> 10:40.539
I mean, as mothers, we fucked up.

10:40.619 --> 10:42.299
We just weren't there for
them when they needed us.

10:42.699 --> 10:44.379
Though we must have done something right.

10:46.979 --> 10:49.539
Hey. It's understandable
you need someone to blame

10:49.619 --> 10:51.259
but you're looking in the wrong place.

10:51.699 --> 10:53.299
My boy didn't do this.

10:53.899 --> 10:55.059
He couldn't.

10:58.139 --> 10:59.499
Get out.

11:00.939 --> 11:02.259
Go on, get out.

11:27.659 --> 11:28.859
- Hi.
- Hi.

11:30.459 --> 11:33.899
Um, you don't have a pen on you, do you?

11:33.979 --> 11:34.979
Yep.

11:35.619 --> 11:36.739
Right, thanks.

11:37.739 --> 11:40.379
They, um... They just disappear in here.

11:40.459 --> 11:41.619
Bloody criminals.

11:44.739 --> 11:45.779
Thanks.

11:46.099 --> 11:48.539
You keep it. I've got a stash at home.

11:51.619 --> 11:52.939
Um, Fletch?

11:54.579 --> 11:57.619
You know, the, um... The other night...

11:57.699 --> 11:59.299
Vera, it wasn't your fault.

11:59.379 --> 12:01.819
No, I mean, I'm just... I'm inexperienced.

12:01.899 --> 12:04.419
What happened, that's all on me.

12:05.019 --> 12:06.499
And I need you to know that.

12:14.099 --> 12:16.139
Um, Vera.

12:16.699 --> 12:19.259
Let me cook you dinner at my place.

12:23.419 --> 12:24.699
I'd like that.

12:27.299 --> 12:28.419
How is it?

12:28.779 --> 12:29.939
It's, um...

12:30.579 --> 12:32.419
It's lovely, thanks.

12:36.579 --> 12:38.339
- Ah, have I got...
- No, no.

12:39.019 --> 12:40.139
It's just you.

12:41.099 --> 12:42.299
Which is good.

12:44.939 --> 12:46.779
It's really nice having you here.

12:49.819 --> 12:51.179
It's nice being here.

12:58.459 --> 12:59.499
Whoops.

13:04.579 --> 13:05.819
Have you got to get going?

13:08.939 --> 13:10.539
I don't want to go home.

13:11.459 --> 13:12.899
Well, you don't have to.

13:12.979 --> 13:16.419
- I mean, I... I can sleep on the couch.
- No. No, no.

13:20.579 --> 13:22.459
I don't want you to sleep on the couch.

13:35.019 --> 13:36.579
Look, I'm sorry, Bea, but police have found

13:36.659 --> 13:38.779
that there's no grounds
for an investigation.

13:40.539 --> 13:41.979
Did you tell them what I said?

13:42.059 --> 13:44.419
- Yes. Yes, of course I did.
- Maybe you didn't explain it properly.

13:44.499 --> 13:45.739
I should talk to them, I think.

13:47.379 --> 13:48.659
Harry gave them Debbie's phone.

13:48.739 --> 13:51.099
On it there are a lot of text
messages to a girl called Matilda.

13:51.179 --> 13:52.859
- Yeah, that's right.
- Well, they were about Brayden

13:52.939 --> 13:54.659
and they were about how
they were using drugs.

13:54.739 --> 13:55.899
So, there's the proof.

13:57.019 --> 13:58.899
Well, she talked about
how much she liked it.

13:59.819 --> 14:01.419
They'd experimented for a while.

14:01.499 --> 14:03.259
Yeah, smoking dope, not heroin.

14:05.819 --> 14:08.539
Police found evidence
in her bedside drawer.

14:08.779 --> 14:10.859
She'd been smoking heroin as well.

14:11.739 --> 14:14.539
There was also bruising on her arm. I'm...

14:14.619 --> 14:17.499
I'm sorry, it wasn't the
first time she'd tried it.

14:24.259 --> 14:25.259
What about...

14:26.579 --> 14:28.499
What about Jacs? What about the threats?

14:28.819 --> 14:30.299
I've got no proof to give them.

14:30.379 --> 14:31.419
She's in here for murder.

14:31.499 --> 14:33.579
And you're charged with attempted murder.

14:34.339 --> 14:37.419
If the police could find information
on Jacs and the Holt family

14:37.499 --> 14:39.019
and they could prosecute, they would.

14:39.099 --> 14:41.099
Yeah, Brayden's her son.

14:41.179 --> 14:44.619
Brayden and Debbie both visited
their mothers in the same prison.

14:44.699 --> 14:46.419
Chances are their paths would cross.

14:46.499 --> 14:47.979
No, no, it's too much of a coincidence.

14:48.059 --> 14:49.419
It's circumstantial.

14:49.979 --> 14:53.619
As far as the police are
concerned, Debbie was a 16-year-old

14:53.699 --> 14:57.059
experimenting with drugs and
it just went terribly wrong.

15:01.739 --> 15:03.659
I know in my gut that's not what happened.

15:04.019 --> 15:05.259
Well, I'm sorry.

15:06.739 --> 15:07.819
You're wrong.

15:18.819 --> 15:20.179
You okay?

15:20.259 --> 15:21.499
You're still here?

15:22.739 --> 15:24.899
If there's anything
else you need, just ask.

15:34.619 --> 15:35.739
Don't start.

15:36.059 --> 15:37.419
Governor told you cops won't do anything.

15:37.499 --> 15:39.099
- It was an accident.
- That's what they say.

15:39.179 --> 15:40.219
It was.

15:40.299 --> 15:42.619
Yeah, so you're a crim,
daughter's a junkie...

15:42.699 --> 15:44.699
My daughter is not a junkie.

15:44.779 --> 15:46.539
Which is why you know
it wasn't an accident.

15:46.619 --> 15:49.219
- Will you stop messing with my head?
- Stop ignoring it.

15:49.899 --> 15:52.059
I thought that my daughter
was killed because of me.

15:53.099 --> 15:55.899
You see this place, it...
It puts things in your mind,

15:55.979 --> 15:58.179
twists them around until you go
crazy and don't know what to believe.

15:58.259 --> 16:00.739
- You know what the truth is.
- Yeah, yeah, I do.

16:01.699 --> 16:03.419
And that's what makes
me different from you.

16:04.499 --> 16:05.979
See, you're all lying about something.

16:06.379 --> 16:07.979
You think that's the only
way you can survive in here.

16:08.059 --> 16:09.179
But I'm not like that.

16:09.619 --> 16:12.059
I'm not going to leave this place any
more screwed up than what I came in.

16:25.539 --> 16:26.539
Hi.

16:27.859 --> 16:29.099
Hey.

16:30.899 --> 16:33.419
- You hungry?
- Yep.

16:33.499 --> 16:35.139
Listen, I was thinking, why don't we go out

16:35.219 --> 16:36.979
and grab some brekkie
before you head to work?

16:38.179 --> 16:40.579
I'm gonna call in sick.

16:42.299 --> 16:43.739
That's a first.

16:45.459 --> 16:46.619
I, um...

16:47.619 --> 16:50.339
I just really don't want to
go in there today and I...

16:51.659 --> 16:53.939
Do you mind if we just
hang around here a bit?

16:54.019 --> 16:55.139
Of course not.

16:56.339 --> 16:58.059
Hey, so what do you feel like? Um...

16:59.099 --> 17:01.139
Cereal? I could whip up some pancakes?

17:01.219 --> 17:02.339
You know, I make a mean omelet.

17:02.419 --> 17:05.259
- Oh, omelet. Omelet sounds good.
- Great, omelet it is.

17:05.739 --> 17:07.138
I've got to grab some more eggs.

17:07.419 --> 17:09.098
Oh, no, no. Don't go to any trouble.

17:09.179 --> 17:10.419
I'll be back soon.

17:12.819 --> 17:13.858
Okay.

18:42.819 --> 18:44.379
I knew what she was doing.

18:44.819 --> 18:46.579
I'd be bloody stupid not to.

18:46.659 --> 18:48.619
Changing shifts and putting me on the slot.

18:49.499 --> 18:52.339
And there was nothing I could
do about it. And she knew that.

18:53.539 --> 18:57.499
She wanted to make me feel like
shit so I'd stop hassling her.

18:58.299 --> 19:02.499
Sometimes I think I just want to hurt
her the same fucking way she hurt me.

19:03.219 --> 19:05.899
Like that dream I keep having.
You know, I'm back in Timor.

19:05.979 --> 19:10.219
I raise my gun, fire, but it's
Meg with a bullet in her head.

19:11.259 --> 19:12.659
But I don't feel anything.

19:13.619 --> 19:15.779
I should never have
started fucking that bitch.

19:18.219 --> 19:19.259
Vera?

19:25.019 --> 19:26.499
I... I have to go.

19:27.099 --> 19:28.579
What are you doing going through my stuff?

19:28.659 --> 19:29.899
Sorry. I, um...

19:30.859 --> 19:32.899
Look, I won't tell anyone, I promise.

19:33.859 --> 19:35.019
What? What?

19:35.099 --> 19:37.059
I know you were angry with Meg. I will...

19:37.339 --> 19:40.579
I won't tell a soul, I
promise. I'm... I've got to go.

19:43.699 --> 19:45.219
What, so you think I killed Meg?

19:47.059 --> 19:48.539
Are you bloody crazy?

19:49.899 --> 19:52.299
I mean, I only wrote that because
a bloody counselor told me to.

19:54.179 --> 19:56.979
- I'm... I'm sorry... I thought...
- Get the fuck out!

20:01.539 --> 20:02.619
Go.

20:17.939 --> 20:20.659
I've informed Bea that there
will be no police investigation

20:20.739 --> 20:22.019
into her daughter's death.

20:22.819 --> 20:24.259
Because it was an accident.

20:24.979 --> 20:26.099
No, I lied.

20:26.659 --> 20:28.619
With you refusing to go into protection,

20:28.699 --> 20:30.979
it's the only way I can
control the situation.

20:31.059 --> 20:33.619
I told you, I had nothing
to do with Debbie's death.

20:35.579 --> 20:37.059
It's out of my hands.

20:37.659 --> 20:40.299
The police are investigating
Brayden and your family.

20:40.739 --> 20:42.939
So, until they've completed
their investigation,

20:43.019 --> 20:46.619
all your phone calls, visits and
mail privileges will be suspended.

20:46.699 --> 20:48.299
I have to speak to my son.

20:48.379 --> 20:50.179
- Put him back on my contact list.
- Not possible.

20:50.259 --> 20:53.099
He'll be devastated about
Debbie. I need to know he's okay.

20:53.739 --> 20:55.859
Well, I'm sure he has his father's support.

20:59.459 --> 21:01.819
I'll be fully cooperating with the police.

21:02.019 --> 21:04.819
If you did have anything to
do with it, they will find out.

21:05.259 --> 21:06.859
They're not gonna let this go.

21:08.139 --> 21:10.339
So, we're lying to Jacs
about the investigation?

21:10.419 --> 21:12.219
Yes. There isn't one.

21:12.299 --> 21:15.499
Putting pressure on her, cutting
off her privileges, it's dangerous.

21:15.579 --> 21:17.139
Sure, but we need to keep her contained.

21:17.219 --> 21:18.299
And while she's contained,

21:18.379 --> 21:20.259
we need to try and find
something the police can't ignore.

21:20.339 --> 21:22.539
Well, maybe if Channing got
involved, the cops will listen?

21:22.619 --> 21:25.539
No, I'm not taking this any further
until I can find solid proof.

21:25.619 --> 21:29.379
So, I need all CCTV footage from
the last three months reviewed.

21:29.459 --> 21:31.659
I need you to focus on the visitor center.

21:31.739 --> 21:34.579
All phone calls Jacs and her crew
have made that have been recorded,

21:34.659 --> 21:35.779
I want it reviewed.

21:35.979 --> 21:38.459
Check the mail logs. Keep
up with the spot checks.

21:38.539 --> 21:40.539
We need to find anything, something,

21:40.619 --> 21:42.419
that can link Jacs with
Debbie Smith's death.

21:42.499 --> 21:44.379
Chance of finding anything's pretty slim.

21:44.459 --> 21:45.659
So, what are you saying, Linda?

21:45.739 --> 21:49.619
We should just ignore this. We
should wait until it just explodes.

21:49.699 --> 21:51.899
Yeah, what if Bea's wrong? We could
be stirring things up for nothing.

21:51.979 --> 21:56.259
Yeah, you call it stirring and I call
it taking control of the situation.

21:57.299 --> 21:58.379
Keep me updated.

22:05.259 --> 22:06.579
Spot check.

22:08.219 --> 22:10.459
I hope you're giving the other
units the same attention as mine.

22:10.539 --> 22:11.619
The women will talk.

22:12.619 --> 22:14.259
Your unit?

22:15.579 --> 22:16.979
Not anymore, Jacs.

22:18.499 --> 22:20.099
What's going on with this investigation?

22:20.579 --> 22:23.619
- You worried what they'll discover?
- Find out for me.

22:23.979 --> 22:25.379
I don't see the point, Jacs.

22:26.539 --> 22:28.979
See, I'm only gonna tell you
what we both already know.

22:29.659 --> 22:31.579
You had something to
do with Debbie's death.

22:38.219 --> 22:39.779
I know who killed your wife.

22:52.899 --> 22:54.019
No, you don't.

22:55.979 --> 22:58.179
- You're desperate.
- So are you.

22:59.459 --> 23:01.579
Been a long time with no information.

23:02.619 --> 23:04.099
Cops couldn't find anything.

23:04.179 --> 23:06.859
No one's talked. Why do you think that is?

23:08.859 --> 23:11.859
- Because I didn't want it to get out.
- That's bullshit.

23:12.619 --> 23:15.379
You've worked around here long
enough to know how I operate,

23:15.939 --> 23:18.059
and what that sort of information's worth.

23:20.219 --> 23:22.259
Maybe it's time to cash it in.

23:23.299 --> 23:24.939
What do you think, Mr. Jackson?

23:49.459 --> 23:50.779
She didn't want to come in.

23:50.859 --> 23:52.219
Her mum told her to stay away.

23:52.779 --> 23:54.179
And how does she feel about that?

23:54.619 --> 23:56.819
She gets freaked. She wants to see her mum,

23:56.899 --> 23:59.259
but doesn't want to go against her.

23:59.819 --> 24:01.139
Yeah, of course.

24:01.219 --> 24:03.619
But Bea needs to see Debbie
to be reminded of just

24:03.699 --> 24:06.299
how much she loves her daughter,
and how much she'll do for her.

24:06.739 --> 24:08.579
Make sure she comes in next time.

24:10.939 --> 24:12.219
Yeah, I'll try.

24:12.659 --> 24:14.099
No, son, you do it.

24:17.219 --> 24:19.499
- Okay.
- Good boy.

24:30.459 --> 24:33.219
I've just listened to an
interesting conversation

24:33.299 --> 24:34.659
between you and your son.

24:36.459 --> 24:38.499
You pushed Brayden to be with Debbie.

24:39.539 --> 24:42.819
You made him bring her in
here to keep her in Bea's face.

24:45.139 --> 24:48.379
You tell me who killed my wife,
and I'll erase the recording.

24:51.139 --> 24:52.419
Who did it?

24:53.379 --> 24:54.699
I'll tell you.

24:56.059 --> 24:59.739
Once you've erased the recording
and had the investigation shut down.

25:00.659 --> 25:01.899
Not before.

25:17.059 --> 25:18.219
Anything?

25:19.099 --> 25:20.339
Well?

25:20.739 --> 25:23.579
Uh, not yet. There's a lot to get through.

25:24.739 --> 25:26.419
Just find me something conclusive.

25:27.019 --> 25:28.579
- Okay?
- Yeah, okay.

25:29.419 --> 25:30.499
Thanks.

25:38.899 --> 25:41.699
I need proof that Jacs
has a vendetta against Bea.

25:45.019 --> 25:47.299
- Now you want to talk to me?
- You want to help Bea?

25:47.379 --> 25:48.779
Please, this is your chance.

25:51.299 --> 25:52.379
Why am I here?

25:52.459 --> 25:54.859
You're here because I wanna make this
prison a better place for the women.

25:56.499 --> 25:58.899
No. Why am I really here?

26:00.379 --> 26:02.499
If you don't wanna help
me, then just leave.

26:02.579 --> 26:04.459
- You don't care about the women.
- Oh, here we go.

26:04.539 --> 26:05.739
It's all bullshit.

26:07.579 --> 26:09.339
You're hiding in here with us.

26:10.379 --> 26:11.859
You get off on being here.

26:12.819 --> 26:13.899
Get out.

26:14.259 --> 26:16.299
And the thing that scares you the most,

26:17.459 --> 26:19.499
is that when you're fucking
him, you're thinking of me.

26:19.579 --> 26:20.659
Get out!

26:20.899 --> 26:22.019
Huh?

26:57.659 --> 27:01.739
The funeral people called. They want
to know what we want to do with her.

27:03.219 --> 27:04.379
The ashes.

27:06.459 --> 27:07.939
Let's bring her home.

27:08.699 --> 27:10.059
Keep her safe.

27:14.939 --> 27:17.339
You know, I never should
have done what I did to you,

27:17.419 --> 27:20.659
but I never should have let things
go on for as long as they did either.

27:21.699 --> 27:23.619
Did you ever think about
how it affected Deb?

27:25.939 --> 27:27.099
I never touched her.

27:27.179 --> 27:28.859
Yeah, but she knew what was going on.

27:29.459 --> 27:31.899
She blamed herself for everything
that happened between you and me.

27:31.979 --> 27:33.299
That's ridiculous.

27:33.379 --> 27:35.859
You know, she thought that I
stayed with you because of her.

27:36.099 --> 27:38.019
So, staying with me was the problem.

27:38.499 --> 27:40.819
- You're blaming me.
- No.

27:42.299 --> 27:44.139
That would be too easy.

27:44.659 --> 27:46.259
And unfair on her.

27:47.259 --> 27:48.779
No, this is my fault.

27:50.419 --> 27:52.859
And I'm gonna do what I should
have done in the first place.

27:54.339 --> 27:57.899
I'm gonna plead guilty, I'm going to
tell them about what really happened.

27:57.979 --> 27:59.419
- About what you did to me.
- You can't.

27:59.499 --> 28:01.979
- I can.
- We agreed. We promised Debs.

28:02.059 --> 28:04.299
You can't keep using Deb like that anymore.

28:05.899 --> 28:09.579
If this gets out, they will do
me for lying. Everyone will know.

28:10.019 --> 28:12.419
We stuffed up, Harry. Big time.

28:13.219 --> 28:14.499
But not anymore.

28:16.579 --> 28:18.779
I'm gonna accept responsibility
for what I've done.

28:35.139 --> 28:36.379
What did the Governor want?

28:37.539 --> 28:39.539
I reckon she's a little
confused about that.

28:40.059 --> 28:41.699
Did she say anything about Bea?

28:44.499 --> 28:45.939
Bea can take care of herself.

28:47.979 --> 28:50.379
- I know what you're doing, Franky.
- What's that?

28:50.459 --> 28:52.659
You're pushing Bea at Jacs all the time,

28:52.739 --> 28:54.739
and you're hoping they're
gonna cancel each other out.

28:55.619 --> 28:58.419
- Ooh! You've been here too long.
- Yeah, maybe.

28:59.459 --> 29:02.539
But Bea is a good person. And
what you're doing is wrong.

29:03.059 --> 29:04.419
And I want you to stop.

29:05.339 --> 29:06.899
Someone will get hurt.

29:07.619 --> 29:09.979
You keep sticking your
nose in, maybe it'll be you.

29:12.059 --> 29:13.179
It's your choice.

29:24.859 --> 29:26.059
Hi.

29:30.499 --> 29:33.059
- Fletch, I'm so sorry.
- I need you to do something for me.

29:34.979 --> 29:36.979
Never mention this to Will.

29:37.059 --> 29:39.379
I don't want him to find
out about me and Meg.

29:41.579 --> 29:42.699
Um...

29:43.819 --> 29:45.139
No, I won't.

29:45.899 --> 29:47.179
Um, Fletch?

29:48.819 --> 29:50.139
Can we talk about us?

29:53.979 --> 29:55.019
Fletch?

29:55.659 --> 29:56.779
Fuck off, Vera.

30:06.219 --> 30:07.619
Yeah?

30:08.899 --> 30:11.459
- Liz Birdsworth to see you, Governor.
- Okay, thank you.

30:12.899 --> 30:14.019
Liz?

30:16.299 --> 30:17.699
Liz, how can I help you?

30:18.019 --> 30:21.139
Well, you said you wanted me to keep
you updated on how the women are doing.

30:21.219 --> 30:22.419
Yes, how are they doing?

30:24.139 --> 30:25.459
You know something?

30:26.899 --> 30:28.019
Liz.

30:28.859 --> 30:32.139
Liz, if you've heard something,
it's your responsibility to tell me.

30:34.099 --> 30:37.259
About a week ago, Bea found
a mobile phone in her cell.

30:37.339 --> 30:39.379
The person who called
said they were with Debbie,

30:39.459 --> 30:40.979
and he said some awful stuff.

30:41.059 --> 30:42.619
And you think Jacs was behind it.

30:42.699 --> 30:45.019
She's had it in for Bea since she got here.

30:47.459 --> 30:48.699
Thank you.

31:37.579 --> 31:38.659
Fletch?

31:43.379 --> 31:44.459
Shit.

31:45.979 --> 31:47.179
I'm gonna kill her.

31:47.419 --> 31:48.939
- Will!
- I'm gonna kill you!

31:49.019 --> 31:50.219
Will!

31:54.819 --> 31:55.939
Get off me!

32:05.259 --> 32:07.859
- It's Meg's.
- I know, mate.

32:08.379 --> 32:09.539
I know.

32:15.419 --> 32:17.859
Meg Jackson's bracelet has
been found in your possession.

32:18.979 --> 32:20.099
Can you explain why?

32:20.899 --> 32:21.979
Yeah.

32:22.699 --> 32:24.019
Someone put it there.

32:24.259 --> 32:27.379
I put it to you that the Governor
slotted you for dealing drugs.

32:27.459 --> 32:29.659
When you were finally
released you were angry.

32:29.739 --> 32:33.579
You wanted payback, so you
organized a riot as a distraction.

32:33.659 --> 32:37.819
You were armed and you waited for an
opportunity to get Meg Jackson alone.

32:37.899 --> 32:39.139
Then you killed her.

32:40.819 --> 32:42.659
At this point I'm gonna take
you down to the police station

32:42.739 --> 32:45.179
and charge you with the
murder of Meg Jackson.

32:45.819 --> 32:47.459
Do you have anything you'd like to say?

32:47.539 --> 32:49.259
I know nothing about it.

32:51.139 --> 32:52.299
Let's go.

33:08.459 --> 33:09.899
Thank you all for coming.

33:10.619 --> 33:12.099
I have an important announcement

33:12.179 --> 33:13.939
regarding the investigation into the death

33:14.019 --> 33:16.459
of the former governor of the
Wentworth Correctional Centre.

33:17.299 --> 33:18.779
Just a short time ago,

33:18.859 --> 33:21.939
Mrs. Jacqueline Holt was charged
with the murder of Meg Jackson.

33:22.339 --> 33:25.139
I'm very proud in saying that
my staff were instrumental

33:25.219 --> 33:28.499
in uncovering key evidence
that led to Mrs. Holt's arrest.

33:29.019 --> 33:32.259
It is now up to the justice system
to determine Mrs. Holt's fate.

33:33.019 --> 33:36.219
I am grateful that, after
a grueling five months,

33:36.699 --> 33:39.939
I can confidently reassure
my staff of their safety,

33:40.379 --> 33:43.779
and deliver on my promise
to you to rehabilitate

33:44.219 --> 33:45.459
not only our prisoners,

33:45.819 --> 33:47.699
but the way that we work here at Wentworth.

33:47.939 --> 33:50.219
Thank you.

34:02.819 --> 34:04.219
Where is she off to?

34:05.699 --> 34:07.259
Rounding them up, is she?

34:07.859 --> 34:09.859
I see missus is in a
bit of trouble, is she?

34:10.299 --> 34:11.978
So, are you sick of her shit yet, or what?

34:13.659 --> 34:15.859
- Is anybody with me?
- Yeah, right.

34:21.659 --> 34:24.619
I know you're with me. I want you to
let her know what you think, all right?

34:28.619 --> 34:31.699
She's got no power on the
outside. She's a fucking cripple.

34:31.779 --> 34:33.579
She killed your kid.

34:35.299 --> 34:37.219
You might not want to
believe it, but she did.

35:00.379 --> 35:01.779
Hey. Hey, hey.

35:01.859 --> 35:04.259
Hey, fuck you! Move your fucking...

35:08.059 --> 35:09.739
You fucking kid killer!

35:20.459 --> 35:21.459
Scum!

35:22.659 --> 35:23.739
Scum!

35:23.819 --> 35:25.699
I'll rip your fucking hair out!

35:29.219 --> 35:30.619
You're a fucking liar!

35:34.779 --> 35:36.979
Hey, Jacs, you're nothing now.

36:19.339 --> 36:21.699
Tell the Governor I'm
going into protection.

36:24.699 --> 36:28.619
You are aware it could take some
time before a bed becomes available.

36:28.699 --> 36:30.019
Weeks, maybe longer.

36:32.619 --> 36:34.179
You'll find me a bed now.

36:34.979 --> 36:37.379
Or I'll go to the Governor
and tell her all about you.

36:38.259 --> 36:40.379
The pain killers, the riot.

36:43.899 --> 36:46.859
Showing you kindness hasn't
really worked for me, has it, Jacs?

36:48.339 --> 36:50.379
That's the way the world works.

36:56.499 --> 36:59.459
Now, you'll go and see her
or I'll tell her what I know.

36:59.539 --> 37:01.579
And you really think
she'll believe you now.

37:01.659 --> 37:03.459
You murdered Meg Jackson.

37:05.139 --> 37:07.619
That little display by the women out there?

37:08.699 --> 37:12.299
That's nothing to what the officers
will do every chance they get.

37:13.539 --> 37:14.859
And I won't stop them.

37:15.579 --> 37:17.619
That'll be the way my world works.

37:51.699 --> 37:52.939
I told you to drop it.

37:53.299 --> 37:56.059
- It's a good book.
- Ah, cut the crap, Franky.

37:56.499 --> 37:58.019
Jacs is finished.

37:58.099 --> 38:00.339
She's either gonna end
up in protection or dead.

38:00.419 --> 38:03.419
So you don't need to use Bea
to do your dirty work anymore.

38:03.499 --> 38:05.979
- What's it to you?
- Leave her alone.

38:06.539 --> 38:08.019
I'll make that decision, eh?

38:08.899 --> 38:11.619
I was watching you when
we found out about Jacs.

38:12.299 --> 38:14.699
Ooh, you didn't see that coming, did you?

38:15.459 --> 38:17.019
Or where it came from.

38:18.259 --> 38:19.579
So, what are you saying?

38:19.659 --> 38:21.059
You remember the riot.

38:36.299 --> 38:38.139
Oh... Oh, fuck!

38:40.779 --> 38:41.779
Shit.

38:50.219 --> 38:51.899
Oh, fuck!

39:08.779 --> 39:10.139
You planted the bracelet.

39:11.059 --> 39:12.179
Yeah.

39:12.379 --> 39:14.659
You wanted to get rid of Jacs. I fixed it.

39:14.739 --> 39:17.739
- Yeah, well, I appreciate it.
- No, I didn't do it for you.

39:17.819 --> 39:19.219
I did it for Bea.

39:20.059 --> 39:22.339
- I told you to stay out of it.
- No.

39:22.899 --> 39:24.979
Now, you said make a choice.

39:26.299 --> 39:27.499
And I have.

39:42.699 --> 39:44.779
I want to know the truth about my daughter.

39:46.899 --> 39:49.379
I knew the first time
we met you were a player.

39:51.819 --> 39:52.899
What happened to her?

39:52.979 --> 39:55.299
They say, "Same recognizes same."

39:56.459 --> 39:57.819
I'm not a murderer.

39:57.899 --> 39:59.699
You tried, with your husband.

39:59.779 --> 40:02.339
- Yeah, but I didn't go through with it.
- A technicality.

40:02.779 --> 40:04.819
You just can't accept who you really are.

40:05.259 --> 40:08.219
Someone who's capable
of taking another life.

40:08.739 --> 40:11.139
- It wasn't like that.
- I know what it's like.

40:11.859 --> 40:14.419
You crossed that line,
but you're still in denial.

40:15.259 --> 40:17.899
Me? I'm at peace with my actions.

40:18.659 --> 40:21.139
- So, who's the more dangerous?
- I couldn't give a fuck.

40:21.219 --> 40:23.699
I want you to tell me what
you did to my daughter.

40:23.779 --> 40:25.539
Don't you think it's
a little late for that?

40:25.619 --> 40:27.539
I know that you're
responsible for her death.

40:28.139 --> 40:30.219
I'm sure you wondered how she'd turn out.

40:30.699 --> 40:34.539
After all those years of her knowing
what you let your husband do to you?

40:35.499 --> 40:37.739
Would she let a man do that to her too?

40:37.819 --> 40:39.779
Would she just sit back and take it?

40:40.979 --> 40:43.579
Debbie made it easy for Brayden.

40:44.139 --> 40:46.379
She was so desperate for attention

40:46.459 --> 40:48.939
that when he gave it to
her she let him do anything.

40:49.739 --> 40:50.779
Sex.

40:51.099 --> 40:53.859
- Drugs.
- God, I knew it. I knew it.

40:53.939 --> 40:56.659
All the signs were there,
but you ignored them.

40:56.739 --> 40:59.659
You pushed her away. You convinced
yourself that everything was fine.

40:59.739 --> 41:01.059
- You didn't want to see that Debbie...
- Shut up!

41:01.139 --> 41:02.859
- ... was just like you.
- You know nothing!

41:02.939 --> 41:05.299
And I almost felt sorry for her.

41:05.379 --> 41:08.459
And then I thought what
she'd got to look forward to.

41:08.539 --> 41:10.699
A life just like her mother's.

41:11.579 --> 41:13.459
It was a kindness, really,

41:13.539 --> 41:16.739
putting her out of her misery.
She was better off dead.

41:36.859 --> 41:38.099
No! No!

42:20.019 --> 42:21.499
Attention, compound! Attention, compound!

42:21.579 --> 42:24.179
This is a code red. All
prisoners, return to your cells.

42:24.259 --> 42:26.699
Back up against the wall, ladies! Let's go!
