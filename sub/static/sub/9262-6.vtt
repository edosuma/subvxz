<i>Third time this month.</i>

00:08.674 --> 00:10.675
I swear,
a bird shits too close to the place

00:10.676 --> 00:13.478

00:13.479 --> 00:16.081

00:38.170 --> 00:40.105
D-don't shoot.

00:42.174 --> 00:45.944
Sir, you all right?

00:45.945 --> 00:47.712
Where are your clothes?

00:50.549 --> 00:52.616
Just stay
where you are.

00:54.186 --> 00:55.487
Stay where you are.

01:00.359 --> 01:02.027
You got a moment?

01:06.232 --> 01:09.100
I just put a call in to one
of my contacts at Justice.

01:09.101 --> 01:10.735
Regarding what?
It's time to end this.

01:10.736 --> 01:12.604
I'm turning over
the blackmail box to them.

01:12.605 --> 01:14.105
And I'm giving you
the opportunity

01:14.106 --> 01:16.307
to come with when I do this,
so we can share the credit.

01:16.308 --> 01:17.642
I want Pezuela in jail.

01:17.643 --> 01:20.111
Not for 30 days
on some pissant charges

01:20.112 --> 01:21.880
his lawyer can plea down
to a fine.

01:21.881 --> 01:23.180
Hey, I'm the one
still washing

01:23.181 --> 01:24.815
Robert Martin's blood
out of my suit.

01:24.816 --> 01:27.485
So this off-the-books
investigation is done.

01:27.486 --> 01:29.221
What about Olivia?

01:29.222 --> 01:30.755
If you turn
over that box now

01:30.756 --> 01:33.592
you're throwing a good woman
and her career under the bus.

01:33.593 --> 01:35.226
She got herself
into that jam.

01:35.227 --> 01:37.195
All she did was
to get arm-twisted

01:37.196 --> 01:39.264
into helping illegals
cross the border.

01:39.265 --> 01:41.499
She doesn't even deal
with Pezuela directly.

01:41.500 --> 01:43.634
She got blackmailed into
committing an illegal act.

01:43.635 --> 01:45.469
She's the only link
we know about for sure.

01:45.470 --> 01:49.240
So if she's got to get dragged
down to bust Pezuela, so be it.

01:50.643 --> 01:52.076
Look.

01:53.613 --> 01:56.180
Pezuela uses a guy named Rios
to do his dirty work.

01:56.181 --> 01:58.750
Now if I can catch
Rios red-handed

01:58.751 --> 02:01.552
and make him
give us Pezuela?

02:01.553 --> 02:02.787
If you can do that,
so can the feds.

02:02.788 --> 02:04.923
Oh, I'm on the inside.

02:04.924 --> 02:08.059
I'm the only one now who
can get Pezuela to trip up.

02:08.060 --> 02:09.961
You've had your chance.

02:09.961 --> 02:11.863
Just give me one more day.

02:11.864 --> 02:13.798
If I can't pull this off

02:13.799 --> 02:15.734
we can both walk into
your buddy's office

02:15.735 --> 02:17.268
day after tomorrow.

02:17.269 --> 02:18.870
All right,
you get 36 hours.

02:18.871 --> 02:20.204
But that box
is getting turned in,

02:20.205 --> 02:21.740
whether you sting Rios
or not.

02:28.180 --> 02:29.748
He had blood on
his hands and chest.

02:29.749 --> 02:31.550
No visible lacerations
or cuts though.

02:31.551 --> 02:32.951
What happened
to his clothes?

02:32.952 --> 02:34.785
He was naked
when we found him.

02:34.786 --> 02:37.222
Seems scared,
he thinks he hurt somebody

02:37.223 --> 02:38.957
but can't remember anything.

02:38.958 --> 02:40.392
Trying to get someone
to come down,

02:40.393 --> 02:42.794
run a test, a psych exam.

02:42.795 --> 02:44.128
This time of night, good luck.

02:44.129 --> 02:45.830
You guys want him
when we're through?

02:45.831 --> 02:47.565
Steve?

02:49.068 --> 02:50.734
Ah, I'm a little busy here.

02:50.735 --> 02:53.037
Any naked girls show up though,
you give me a holler.

02:53.038 --> 02:54.205
If psych
doesn't want him,

02:54.206 --> 02:55.840
I'll take him in the morning.
Okay.

03:07.586 --> 03:12.623
The last time we were here,
Shane stood right next to us.

03:13.959 --> 03:18.496
He watched as I vowed to get
the guy who killed Lem.

03:18.497 --> 03:19.831
All this time
has passed,

03:19.832 --> 03:22.199
and I still haven't made
good on my promise.

03:27.739 --> 03:29.707
Why are we here?

03:31.177 --> 03:35.780
Aceveda's taking the box
to Justice day after tomorrow.

03:38.651 --> 03:40.351
We lose a lot of
leverage with Rezian

03:40.352 --> 03:42.854
when he finds that
that box is out of play.

03:42.855 --> 03:45.023
What do we do?

03:45.024 --> 03:46.957
I've been standing here
for the last two hours

03:46.958 --> 03:48.626
trying to figure that out.

03:48.627 --> 03:51.362
I think I've come up with a way
to dig us out of our hole.

03:51.363 --> 03:53.264
Which one?

03:53.265 --> 03:54.532
All of them.

03:54.533 --> 03:56.801
I've got a plan
that's gonna get rid

03:56.802 --> 03:58.436
of our Armenian
problem for good,

03:58.437 --> 04:01.205
take care of Pezuela in a way
that secures my badge.

04:01.206 --> 04:04.009
And that will give Lem
the justice he deserves.

04:04.010 --> 04:05.943
You were right,
we can't just wait around

04:05.944 --> 04:09.547
until Shane makes a mistake
that's gonna drown us.

04:09.548 --> 04:11.483
As long as he's around,

04:11.484 --> 04:13.818
we'll never
breathe free air again.

04:13.819 --> 04:17.154
Wait a second. We go through
with what you're talking about.

04:17.156 --> 04:18.488
There's no turning back.

04:18.490 --> 04:20.558
Never thought I'd convince you.
You don't.

04:20.559 --> 04:24.161
But doing this in a rush,
to meet some deadline,

04:24.162 --> 04:25.763
we're bound
to make a mistake.

04:25.764 --> 04:28.833
Look, it's time we made
good on our vow.

04:28.834 --> 04:30.735
We owe it to Lem.

04:34.573 --> 04:37.308
What's the plan?

04:37.309 --> 04:41.345
What I'm thinking about,
won't ever lead back to us.

04:59.331 --> 05:00.932
Where you guys been?

05:02.568 --> 05:05.302
We've been talking, I may let
the rough patch between us

05:05.303 --> 05:07.772
make me a little hardheaded
about the blackmail box.

05:07.773 --> 05:09.774
I told Vic about that
conversation that we had.

05:09.775 --> 05:12.777
Soon as that thing is back
in Pezuela's hands

05:12.778 --> 05:16.014
Rezian's eternally grateful
and we can move past all this.

05:16.015 --> 05:19.050
The problem is,
Pezuela is not gonna wanna pay

05:19.051 --> 05:21.352
for something he considers his.

05:21.353 --> 05:22.586
But Rezian might.

05:22.587 --> 05:25.189
Our third and final
wish to the Armenians.

05:25.190 --> 05:27.391
Considering all the hell
we've been through,

05:27.392 --> 05:30.027
might as well earn
a little scratch for it.

05:31.397 --> 05:33.764
Call Rezian.

05:33.765 --> 05:35.733
Tell him the owner of the box
is willing to sell it.

05:35.734 --> 05:37.902
For a price.
Okay. All right.

05:37.903 --> 05:41.906
So we get a couple of cholos
to play the role of our sellers.

05:41.907 --> 05:44.209
I say we could milk at least
a hundred grand out of this.

05:44.210 --> 05:45.276
I'll find the cholos.

05:45.277 --> 05:47.211
Get us face time
with Rezian this morning.

05:47.212 --> 05:49.647
We gotta agree to terms
before we make the delivery.

05:49.648 --> 05:52.249
Yeah, sure.

05:52.250 --> 05:54.786
I gotta tell you it's gonna feel
real good to move past this.

05:54.787 --> 05:56.521
Already feel
like there's this weight--

06:01.827 --> 06:04.628
Oh, I'm sorry.
Am I interrupting something?

06:04.629 --> 06:06.230
Look what crawled in.

06:06.231 --> 06:08.933
Tavon. How you doing?

06:08.934 --> 06:10.868
I, uh...

06:10.869 --> 06:12.202
I'm pretty good.

06:12.203 --> 06:13.871
Just got off disability
a few weeks ago.

06:13.872 --> 06:16.207
Still have some
physical therapy to do though.

06:16.208 --> 06:17.841
Really. That's great, man.

06:17.842 --> 06:20.311
Yeah. They got your boy
working Hollywood now.

06:20.312 --> 06:21.880
Yeah.

06:21.881 --> 06:24.949
Blow jobs from B-listers,
sounds like good therapy to me.

06:24.950 --> 06:27.819
That's not so bad.
It's, uh--

06:27.820 --> 06:30.488
Hey, Julien.

06:30.489 --> 06:32.757
Oh, you went out and found
yourself another brother?

06:34.460 --> 06:36.961
They, They letting you ride
in the front of the bus yet?

06:36.962 --> 06:38.897
Sorry.
Yep.

06:38.898 --> 06:40.565
Doesn't matter.

06:40.566 --> 06:42.400
Listen, ah, Julien.

06:42.401 --> 06:46.537
These guys, they might be tight,
but they're not unbreakable.

06:48.707 --> 06:51.943
Listen, eh,
my sympathies about Lem.

06:53.646 --> 06:55.746
Oh, thanks.

06:56.315 --> 06:57.948
What brings you to the Barn?

06:57.949 --> 07:01.519
Oh, I actually came
to talk to that guy.

07:01.520 --> 07:03.454
Oh, you got a minute
to run upstairs

07:03.455 --> 07:04.955
and chat with your captain?

07:04.956 --> 07:06.957
Yeah. What about?
Gary Barba.

07:06.958 --> 07:08.926
Hope he fell
into a meat grinder.

07:08.927 --> 07:11.996
He popped back up on the grid
and landed right in my lap.

07:11.997 --> 07:15.099
Sure. Yeah. Let's go.

07:16.401 --> 07:18.469
I'll, uh--
I'll catch you guys later.

07:18.470 --> 07:21.439
- Yeah, do that.
- See you later.

07:21.440 --> 07:22.240
Who's Gary Barba?

07:22.241 --> 07:25.443
A blast from Shane's past.

07:25.444 --> 07:28.980
Don't worry.
It won't slow us down.

07:28.981 --> 07:30.414
I liked Barba for a rape

07:30.415 --> 07:33.518
back when, uh, Vic and I
were working Vice,

07:33.519 --> 07:35.686
uh, we couldn't get enough
to bring him in.

07:35.687 --> 07:36.921
Piece of shit goes off

07:36.922 --> 07:39.323
and kills his family
a week later.

07:39.324 --> 07:42.493
Only survivor was his, um,
10-year-old daughter Camille.

07:42.494 --> 07:44.228
And he's been a fugitive
ever since.

07:44.229 --> 07:46.597
I mean, completely off
the radar for six years

07:46.598 --> 07:48.665
until this week, when
he reached out to Camille.

07:48.666 --> 07:51.935
No shit.
Her foster family lives in Hollywood.

07:51.936 --> 07:53.838
They contacted us
two days ago.

07:53.839 --> 07:56.474
How's Cammy doing?

07:56.475 --> 07:58.075
She's in bad shape.

07:58.076 --> 07:59.777
I mean, he's been
calling her every day.

07:59.778 --> 08:01.479
I mean, at first
he wasn't even talking,

08:01.480 --> 08:03.080
just breathing.

08:03.081 --> 08:05.283
And now he's trying to get her
to meet, face to face.

08:05.284 --> 08:07.585
Camille told me
that she was close to you.

08:07.586 --> 08:09.654
I stayed with her
in protective custody

08:09.655 --> 08:13.424
while we were trying to track
down her asshole of a dad.

08:13.425 --> 08:14.925
Camille isn't comfortable

08:14.926 --> 08:16.527
with going face to face
with her old man.

08:16.528 --> 08:18.095
Even with undercovers
around her.

08:18.096 --> 08:20.864
She said she'd only do it
if Shane was there with her.

08:20.865 --> 08:22.133
Can Ronnie spare you?

08:22.134 --> 08:24.068
Oh, for this, yeah.

08:28.473 --> 08:31.375
You know what? I've gotta wrap
up a few things here first.

08:31.376 --> 08:33.410
I'll, um--
I'll meet you there.

08:33.412 --> 08:36.046
Yeah, listen, before we,
uh, get into all this,

08:36.047 --> 08:38.916
I just really wanna
apologize to you

08:38.917 --> 08:40.717
for hitting Mara that night.

08:40.719 --> 08:42.787
Look, what happened in the past
is exactly that.

08:42.788 --> 08:47.090
I've, uh-- I've moved on
and so has my wife.

08:49.361 --> 08:51.796
I really am sorry.

08:53.164 --> 08:54.598
Okay.

09:01.472 --> 09:03.707
Anything interesting?

09:03.708 --> 09:05.442
Barba's back.

09:05.443 --> 09:07.578
Got a chance to take him.
I'm gonna assist.

09:07.579 --> 09:09.047
We got that
other thing today.

09:09.048 --> 09:11.882
I know. I'll set it up.
I'll have to go back and forth.

09:11.883 --> 09:13.851
I need you to appreciate
the seriousness

09:13.852 --> 09:15.653
of what we're trying
to do here, Shane.

09:15.654 --> 09:18.589
I do,
but Barba is here today.

09:19.558 --> 09:23.360
Tavon say anything else?
No.

09:23.361 --> 09:25.563
You know, he still thinks
he smacked Mara around.

09:25.564 --> 09:29.400
Good. Got enough
problems as it is.

09:37.475 --> 09:40.177
What's the daily word
from the streets?

09:40.178 --> 09:43.747
More like a whisper.
Nothing worth repeating.

09:43.748 --> 09:45.850
Nothing
on the Armenians?

09:48.486 --> 09:50.387
Let me decide that.

09:51.756 --> 09:54.225
I might have
heard something.

09:54.226 --> 09:56.227
I'd rather not
tell you about it

09:56.228 --> 09:59.463
because I'm afraid of what
you'll do with the information.

09:59.464 --> 10:01.299
I don't pay you
to be afraid.

10:01.300 --> 10:02.834
You don't pay me
enough to stand by

10:02.835 --> 10:05.336
while you assassinate
city officials either.

10:05.337 --> 10:07.438
It made my point.

10:07.439 --> 10:09.306
Yeah, and it scared
the real Armenian targets

10:09.307 --> 10:10.474
right into hiding.

10:10.475 --> 10:12.276
And you know
where they are?

10:15.580 --> 10:17.081
Look, I need to be sure

10:17.082 --> 10:18.916
there will be
no more civilian casualties.

10:18.917 --> 10:20.550
I already made my point.

10:21.720 --> 10:22.954
All right, the word is

10:22.955 --> 10:24.856
the Armenian Board
of Directors is meeting.

10:24.857 --> 10:26.257
All of them. In one spot.

10:26.258 --> 10:28.159
Where and when?
Tonight.

10:28.160 --> 10:31.262
I'll have
all the details soon.

10:31.263 --> 10:34.866
Coordinate with Rios.
Give him the details.

10:34.867 --> 10:36.533
If you're gonna go
through with this,

10:36.534 --> 10:39.937
it's gonna burn hot
and bright for a long time.

10:39.938 --> 10:43.340
Now, it might be best if your
boys get lost afterwards.

10:43.341 --> 10:44.842
Real lost.

10:47.713 --> 10:49.380
Why would he come back now?

10:49.381 --> 10:51.449
Ah, baby, your old man
is a bad penny,

10:51.450 --> 10:53.251
and he was bound to show up
sooner or later.

10:53.252 --> 10:56.020
The important thing
is I am here,

10:56.021 --> 10:57.821
and I am not
going anywhere

10:57.822 --> 11:00.958
until you're safe
and he's under arrest.

11:00.959 --> 11:03.394
Shane and I will be
listening the whole call.

11:03.395 --> 11:05.563
Okay? And he can guide you
through any bumps.

11:05.564 --> 11:07.064
You ready for when he calls?

11:07.065 --> 11:08.665
I'm ready. Are you?

11:08.666 --> 11:10.301
Look, you don't
want him out there,

11:10.302 --> 11:12.703
never knowing when
he's gonna show up again.

11:12.704 --> 11:15.039
Now trust me, Cammy,
you are better off

11:15.040 --> 11:17.442
dealing with trouble now

11:17.443 --> 11:19.877
than looking over your shoulder
for the rest of your life.

11:19.878 --> 11:21.746
Okay?

11:26.885 --> 11:28.152
Ah, God.

11:29.621 --> 11:31.455
Jesus, I've been
calling you all morning.

11:31.456 --> 11:33.123
I practically beat in
the front door.

11:33.124 --> 11:35.226
I thought you were
supposed to be at the hospital.

11:35.227 --> 11:37.195
I took a personal day.

11:38.330 --> 11:39.630
Are you all right?

11:39.631 --> 11:41.632
Yeah, yeah.
What's going on?

11:41.633 --> 11:43.133
We were supposed to meet,
remember?

11:43.134 --> 11:44.901
To talk about
counseling for Cass.

11:45.904 --> 11:47.171
Can we do it tomorrow?

11:47.172 --> 11:49.474
You've been bitching to me
about being more involved.

11:49.475 --> 11:50.775
Now you wanna
do it tomorrow?

11:50.776 --> 11:51.942
I just...

11:52.911 --> 11:54.812
A-- Are you--?
Let me look at you.

11:54.813 --> 11:56.747
Are you on something?

11:56.748 --> 11:58.582
Goddamn it, you're high.

11:58.583 --> 12:01.285
I couldn't sleep last night,
and I had these pills.

12:01.286 --> 12:03.987
What kind of pills?
The kind that help you sleep.

12:03.988 --> 12:06.424
Well, looking at your eyes,
they look like downs.

12:06.425 --> 12:08.592
You have any idea how
addictive those things are?

12:08.593 --> 12:10.094
Between Shane kidnapping us

12:10.095 --> 12:12.162
and your ex-cop buddy
guarding us

12:12.163 --> 12:13.931
I haven't had
a lot of rest lately.

12:13.932 --> 12:15.799
Our three children
are living in this house

12:15.800 --> 12:17.535
under your supervision.

12:17.536 --> 12:19.303
Now, if you have to
pop downs

12:19.304 --> 12:20.971
in order to handle
what's happening,

12:20.972 --> 12:23.507
maybe we should figure out
a different plan.

12:23.508 --> 12:25.075
That's just great.

12:25.076 --> 12:28.078
Let that be the last thing
you say before you leave.

12:30.415 --> 12:32.249
Our daughter's
falling apart,

12:32.250 --> 12:34.719
and you're snoring
the day away?

12:41.326 --> 12:45.462
I can't remember anything
after 11 last night.

12:45.463 --> 12:47.198
Where were you then?

12:47.199 --> 12:50.033
Watching the news at home.

12:50.034 --> 12:53.003
Must have fallen asleep.
I sleepwalk.

12:53.004 --> 12:54.538
Really?

12:54.539 --> 12:57.675
You ever, uh, woken up
in strange places before?

12:57.676 --> 13:00.144
Most of the time
I come to in my house,

13:00.145 --> 13:02.446
the garage, the kitchen.

13:02.447 --> 13:03.581
Most of the time?

13:03.582 --> 13:06.183
Once I woke up
at a convenience store.

13:06.184 --> 13:09.053
I was arrested
for public indecency.

13:09.054 --> 13:10.454
I was naked then too.

13:10.455 --> 13:12.889
How does your, uh,
girlfriend feel

13:12.890 --> 13:15.025
about you running
all over town naked?

13:15.026 --> 13:16.793
I don't have a girlfriend.

13:16.794 --> 13:19.930
I'm married. Well, been
separated, six months.

13:19.931 --> 13:21.866
You do any drugs
last night?

13:21.867 --> 13:23.133
Uh, have anything to drink?

13:23.134 --> 13:25.102
No. I'm-- I'm recovering.

13:25.103 --> 13:27.705
Any idea
who you might have hurt?

13:27.706 --> 13:29.073
I was sleepwalking.

13:29.074 --> 13:31.275
You ever see a doctor
about this problem?

13:31.276 --> 13:32.643
I know how it sounds.

13:32.644 --> 13:34.645
I'm just scared I hurt someone.

13:34.646 --> 13:36.546
I wanna make sure
they're all right.

13:36.547 --> 13:39.283
Okay, Officer Hanlon
took a sample

13:39.284 --> 13:41.452
of the, uh, blood that's on you.

13:41.453 --> 13:42.686
Soon as we get a type,

13:42.687 --> 13:45.622
we can match it against
any reported assaults,

13:45.623 --> 13:46.791
murder victims in the area.

13:46.792 --> 13:48.125
Was somebody murdered?

13:48.126 --> 13:50.061
Let's not get
ahead of ourselves.

13:50.062 --> 13:51.161
What happened to your wrists?

13:51.162 --> 13:54.931
Um, sometimes I tie
myself up at night.

13:54.932 --> 13:57.234
To stop myself from leaving.

13:58.436 --> 14:00.437
Okay.

14:02.107 --> 14:03.407
Well, this isn't
the first time

14:03.408 --> 14:04.909
he's been caught
waving his willy.

14:04.910 --> 14:06.344
Ah, he told me.

14:06.345 --> 14:08.412
Looks like unis
responded to a 911 call

14:08.413 --> 14:09.780
from his wife
six months ago.

14:09.781 --> 14:12.450
Right around the time Jeff
said they were separated.

14:12.451 --> 14:13.850
Could be our victim.

14:13.851 --> 14:15.619
Let's track her down,
find out.

14:15.620 --> 14:17.722
How's the Tavon thing coming along?

14:17.723 --> 14:19.356
Stopped by
to check on Camille.

14:19.357 --> 14:22.026
She looks great, man,
you ought to see her.

14:22.027 --> 14:24.461
She's really grown up
in the last few years.

14:24.462 --> 14:26.664
Really likes
her new family too.

14:26.665 --> 14:28.399
Hey, you get a lock down
on this old man?

14:28.400 --> 14:30.901
We gotta tell Rezian what time
this thing's happening.

14:30.902 --> 14:32.703
Barba wants a meeting
in the park.

14:32.704 --> 14:34.338
It's gonna be
this afternoon.

14:34.339 --> 14:38.508
I tell you, it's gonna feel
really good righting that wrong.

14:40.311 --> 14:41.612
Let's go get paid.

14:41.613 --> 14:43.447
Okay.

14:46.718 --> 14:49.086
Open up,
you shit heads.

14:51.056 --> 14:53.657
Come on, open this door.

14:55.394 --> 14:56.927
Goddamn.

14:56.928 --> 14:58.629
Smells like
a dog's ass in here.

14:58.630 --> 15:00.430
You boys forget
to slap on some deodorant?

15:00.431 --> 15:02.199
Till my people stop
getting slaughtered

15:02.200 --> 15:06.737
I'll be interested
in survival not luxury.

15:06.738 --> 15:08.739
You said you have the box?
I don't.

15:08.740 --> 15:10.341
But I found out who does.

15:10.342 --> 15:12.809
Someone inside the
Mexi's been pulling a fast one

15:12.810 --> 15:14.545
on his bosses pointing
the finger at you

15:14.546 --> 15:16.881
while he plays God
with his little box of intel.

15:16.882 --> 15:18.515
Now that the heat's
getting too high,

15:18.516 --> 15:21.151
he wants to off load
the box once and for all.

15:21.152 --> 15:23.320
Asking price is $100,000.

15:23.321 --> 15:25.555
As far as I'm concerned,
that's cheap.

15:25.556 --> 15:27.657
You're gonna make 10 times
that in blackmail alone.

15:27.658 --> 15:30.794
Or sell it back to the Mexis
for twice as much

15:30.795 --> 15:32.396
and end this war.

15:32.397 --> 15:34.164
It sounds like
a Mexican problem.

15:34.165 --> 15:35.933
Let their gang
handle it internally.

15:35.934 --> 15:37.635
The Mexicans think
you still have it,

15:37.636 --> 15:39.102
so it's gonna stay
your problem.

15:39.103 --> 15:41.539
And eventually you're gonna
run out of lamb kebab,

15:41.540 --> 15:43.073
have to poke your head out.

15:43.074 --> 15:46.444
Now, hopefully, you won't catch
a bullet anywhere it hurts.

15:48.347 --> 15:49.580
Forget it.

15:49.581 --> 15:52.750
They'll have no problem
getting another buyer.

15:52.751 --> 15:54.618
Can I see this box?

15:54.619 --> 15:56.654
Nine o'clock tonight.

15:56.655 --> 15:58.555
That is, if you can get
the cash that soon.

15:58.556 --> 16:00.757
Good.

16:00.758 --> 16:02.893
The sellers wanna bring
a full crew,

16:02.894 --> 16:04.228
guarantee their protection.

16:04.229 --> 16:05.495
Then I want
a full crew as well.

16:05.496 --> 16:06.663
Fine.

16:06.664 --> 16:08.599
You bring your three
lieutenants with you.

16:08.600 --> 16:09.766
No weapons.

16:09.767 --> 16:11.101
I'll screen the Mexicans,

16:11.102 --> 16:13.336
make sure no one has
an itchy trigger finger.

16:13.337 --> 16:15.239
Absolutely not.

16:15.240 --> 16:16.874
You're asking me
to expose myself

16:16.875 --> 16:18.875
and my men while there's
a target on our heads?

16:18.876 --> 16:20.878
I'll be there with you,
armed.

16:20.879 --> 16:24.248
Anything looks out of place,
I'll pull the plug.

16:26.551 --> 16:29.853
Can't get a better guarantee
than that.

16:29.854 --> 16:32.389
Here you go. Thanks.

16:34.058 --> 16:35.726
What's this?

16:35.727 --> 16:38.228
Composite sketches of
the Robert Martin shooters.

16:38.229 --> 16:41.098
Mayor wants them hung
in every precinct.

16:43.568 --> 16:44.835
Help yourself.

16:44.836 --> 16:46.537
A man attacks you
in the line of duty,

16:46.538 --> 16:48.539
and this is the first time
I'm hearing about it?

16:48.540 --> 16:51.142
Army surplus room
was supposed to be cleared.

16:51.143 --> 16:53.110
I didn't wanna get another
officer in trouble.

16:53.111 --> 16:55.712
You understand if you had
stepped forward sooner--

16:55.713 --> 16:58.782
I spent hours looking through
mug shots. On my own time.

16:58.783 --> 17:00.351
This guy wasn't
in any of them.

17:00.352 --> 17:01.552
This is the first time

17:01.553 --> 17:04.488
I've even come across his face
since that night.

17:04.489 --> 17:07.624
New intel which makes
the Robert Martin shooters

17:07.625 --> 17:09.226
the same
as our body draggers.

17:09.227 --> 17:11.428
I need the Strike Team
to look into where they are.

17:11.429 --> 17:13.364
Any gangs you can roust.

17:13.365 --> 17:16.032
I-I know where Shane is.
Where's Vic?

17:16.034 --> 17:17.034
He's on his way here
now.

17:17.035 --> 17:20.271
From doing what?
Running down a lead.

17:20.271 --> 17:21.405
On what?

17:21.406 --> 17:23.073
This ongoing
Mexican-Armenian shit.

17:23.074 --> 17:25.275
The shit is what
you're trying to feed me.

17:25.276 --> 17:26.843
I put you in charge
of the Strike Team

17:26.844 --> 17:29.246
so I could have somebody
who could be held accountable.

17:29.247 --> 17:30.781
Captain,
he's running down a lead.

17:30.782 --> 17:34.151
If I wanted to be lied to daily,
I would have left him in charge.

17:34.152 --> 17:37.288
Now, the truth is, that he is
running around out there

17:37.289 --> 17:40.424
doing God knows what while
you are content to sit back

17:40.425 --> 17:42.359
and cover his ass repeatedly.

17:42.360 --> 17:44.494
Now, I've told you
time and time again,

17:44.495 --> 17:47.631
so a reprimand goes
in your jacket.

17:47.632 --> 17:52.435
One more you lose the team, plus
your job, if I can manage it.

17:52.436 --> 17:54.637
You understand?
Yeah.

17:54.638 --> 17:58.675
I am prepared to make it through
putting up with Vic's bullshit

17:58.676 --> 18:00.143
till the hearing.

18:00.144 --> 18:03.980
The question is, who's gonna
be left after he's gone?

18:04.949 --> 18:06.350
Check it.
Hey.

18:06.351 --> 18:08.118
Where you off to?

18:08.119 --> 18:09.486
Somebody connected
a few dots.

18:09.487 --> 18:11.755
Claudette knows the Martin
shooters are the same guys

18:11.756 --> 18:13.023
who did the draggings.

18:13.024 --> 18:14.591
She connected them
to Rios yet?

18:14.592 --> 18:15.893
No.

18:17.295 --> 18:20.196
What happened with Rezian?
He's in.

18:20.197 --> 18:23.000
Shane even offered to ride
the deal from the Armenian side,

18:23.001 --> 18:25.135
I didn't even have
to suggest it to him.

18:25.136 --> 18:28.706
I think he's already spent
his share of the hundred G's.

18:28.707 --> 18:30.874
Holy shit.

18:30.875 --> 18:32.843
This is gonna work,
isn't it?

18:37.515 --> 18:39.917
Blood tests
on the naked guy came back.

18:39.918 --> 18:41.318
Can you believe this?

18:41.319 --> 18:43.754
My lawyer says my disability
case is hanging by a thread.

18:43.755 --> 18:45.990
I'm lucky to get payment
for days missed.

18:45.991 --> 18:47.124
Um... sorry?

18:47.125 --> 18:49.192
Where are we at on Mr. Busada?

18:49.193 --> 18:51.661
Blood came back AB negative,
as in not his.

18:51.662 --> 18:53.964
But get this,
the wife's 911 call

18:53.965 --> 18:56.599
was because he was
choking her in her sleep.

18:56.600 --> 18:58.201
Claims he doesn't
remember doing it.

18:58.202 --> 18:59.636
Because he was
sleep killing.

18:59.637 --> 19:01.672
I think the parasomnia
claim is bullshit.

19:01.673 --> 19:04.375
He lied to cover up what he did,
like he lied to the ex-wife.

19:04.376 --> 19:06.944
We don't find the victim,
he comes off as paranoid.

19:06.945 --> 19:10.413
We do, he's already
established his defense.

19:10.414 --> 19:11.681
That Lloyd kid burned you,

19:11.682 --> 19:13.417
gets away with shooting
his school buddy

19:13.418 --> 19:15.152
and you start
taking it out on everybody

19:15.153 --> 19:17.954
who walks through that door?
Quit projecting on this guy.

19:17.955 --> 19:19.489
Uh, I would hardly say
Lloyd burned me,

19:19.490 --> 19:21.525
and haven't you got
a lawsuit to lose?

19:21.526 --> 19:23.827
Sounds like it's time to have
another talk with Mr. Busada.

19:23.828 --> 19:26.096
Yeah. I'd love to,

19:26.097 --> 19:28.232
but I got a legal catastrophe
on my hands here.

19:28.233 --> 19:31.868
Dutch boy's gonna have to screw
this one up without me.

19:31.869 --> 19:34.771
I guess I'm on my own?
I could use the diversion.

19:40.645 --> 19:41.978
You okay? What's wrong?

19:41.979 --> 19:43.614
Just got a call from Rios.

19:43.615 --> 19:45.616
He says he needs safe
passage out of the country

19:45.617 --> 19:47.317
for himself
and two others late tonight.

19:47.318 --> 19:49.085
Something big must be
going down today.

19:49.086 --> 19:51.288
I haven't heard any
lip flapping on the street.

19:51.289 --> 19:52.856
I've been thinking
of turning myself in,

19:52.857 --> 19:55.659
deal with this the way that
I should've from the beginning.

19:55.660 --> 19:57.928
You've done nothing but
try to protect your brother.

19:57.929 --> 19:59.629
I will keep you clear
of this.

19:59.630 --> 20:02.398
This is my litter box.
I'm not worried about myself.

20:02.399 --> 20:04.301
Why is it that people like
Pezuela walk around free

20:04.302 --> 20:05.869
while you're falling
on your sword?

20:05.870 --> 20:07.838
Because I don't have
any options right now.

20:07.839 --> 20:09.273
Because I did wrong.

20:09.274 --> 20:11.575
You always have other options.

20:14.411 --> 20:16.980
Let's say you were gonna help
these guys with this task.

20:16.981 --> 20:18.615
How would you do it?
I'm not.

20:18.616 --> 20:21.718
I'm just trying to figure out
a way to string them along,

20:21.719 --> 20:23.853
buy us some time.
Time to do what?

20:23.854 --> 20:25.655
If we can deliver
Rios on something solid,

20:25.656 --> 20:27.357
we can get him
to turn on Pezuela.

20:27.358 --> 20:28.825
Whatever they're
planning today

20:28.826 --> 20:30.760
sounds like a perfect
opportunity.

20:30.761 --> 20:32.796
And if we don't figure out
what they're up to on time?

20:32.797 --> 20:34.665
Vic, I can't have any
more blood on my hands.

20:34.666 --> 20:36.633
Oh, we'll never
let it come to that.

20:36.634 --> 20:38.201
Just call Rios,

20:38.202 --> 20:40.503
tell him you're trying
to get his paperwork together.

20:40.504 --> 20:42.072
Meanwhile, I'll--
I'll find out

20:42.073 --> 20:43.974
why he's in such a rush
to leave, okay?

20:45.310 --> 20:46.643
Yeah.

20:47.845 --> 20:50.413
I'm gonna take care
of you in this.

20:53.217 --> 20:55.385
Señor Rios.

20:55.386 --> 20:56.854
Give lube-jobs
dressed like that?

20:56.855 --> 20:59.623
You have
information for me?

20:59.624 --> 21:02.826
Witnesses made two of your boys
for the Robert Martin killing.

21:02.827 --> 21:05.495
Same two guys who dragged
a couple of Salvadorans around

21:05.496 --> 21:07.197
like tin cans on a limo.

21:07.198 --> 21:08.365
These are the same two guys

21:08.366 --> 21:10.868
you plan on using
for our thing tonight?

21:10.869 --> 21:13.136
Half the force is already
out looking for them.

21:13.137 --> 21:15.739
Make sure they can't be found.
They won't be.

21:15.740 --> 21:18.441
How's your exit
strategy coming along?

21:18.442 --> 21:19.876
How are your boys
skipping town?

21:19.877 --> 21:21.978
That's not your concern.

21:21.979 --> 21:23.246
With my badge on the line

21:23.247 --> 21:25.449
and Pezuela about to be
my only paycheck,

21:25.450 --> 21:28.084
you bet your ass
it's my concern.

21:28.085 --> 21:29.386
A call has been made.

21:29.387 --> 21:31.788
I'm not gonna do this dance
after every question.

21:31.789 --> 21:33.323
How is it being handled?

21:33.324 --> 21:34.525
I've received confirmation

21:34.526 --> 21:36.593
that our new identification
is being drafted.

21:36.594 --> 21:37.660
Satisfied?

21:38.897 --> 21:41.197
Be at the armo junkyard
on Bradwell.

21:41.198 --> 21:43.433
Little after 9.

21:43.434 --> 21:46.136
Everyone will be there?
Everyone who counts.

21:46.137 --> 21:48.072
You put one of them
in the ground,

21:48.073 --> 21:50.807
you better make sure
put them all there.

21:55.546 --> 21:58.181
Anyone having better luck
than me finding these assholes?

21:58.182 --> 22:00.917
Southside door to door
got me nothing but blank stares.

22:00.918 --> 22:02.920
Byz Lats
are in the dark too.

22:03.654 --> 22:04.988
How'd the takedown go?

22:04.989 --> 22:07.224
Asshole dad sensed something
and almost cancelled.

22:07.225 --> 22:10.193
So I'm gonna have to push
that other thing a little later.

22:11.862 --> 22:13.997
Ah, show me which locations
we have left to hit.

22:19.837 --> 22:21.838
I don't think this other
thing can wait until later.

22:21.839 --> 22:23.340
Why not?
You own the cholos, right?

22:23.341 --> 22:24.975
Just tell them
to push an hour.

22:24.976 --> 22:28.244
What if Rezian gets cold feet
because of these changes?

22:28.245 --> 22:29.479
It's a couple hours, man.

22:29.480 --> 22:33.650
Which is it? One hour
or a couple of hours?

22:33.651 --> 22:35.319
All right, fine.

22:35.320 --> 22:37.487
I'll make sure our
Mexican proxies know

22:37.488 --> 22:38.755
the meeting has been pushed.

22:38.756 --> 22:41.358
But make sure you and the armos
are there on time, okay?

22:41.359 --> 22:44.561
I wouldn't miss this
for the world.

22:44.562 --> 22:45.829
Okay.

22:45.830 --> 22:49.466
I was grabbing Sophia,
not choking her.

22:49.467 --> 22:50.801
I was asleep when I did it.

22:50.802 --> 22:52.803
That's not what
you told your wife.

22:52.804 --> 22:55.405
In fact, you told her you
didn't remember what you did.

22:55.406 --> 22:57.107
I didn't know
what was happening.

22:57.108 --> 22:58.508
Fine.

22:58.509 --> 22:59.876
Let's, uh,

22:59.877 --> 23:01.845
talk about your trip
to the convenience store

23:01.846 --> 23:04.781
a month earlier.
I was asleep then too.

23:04.782 --> 23:07.284
I was. I-- I swear.

23:07.285 --> 23:08.952
I have a disorder.

23:08.953 --> 23:10.553
It's called parasomnia, Jeff.

23:10.554 --> 23:12.455
And if you'd really had
a problem this severe,

23:12.456 --> 23:14.524
I think you'd know what
the proper name for it was.

23:14.525 --> 23:16.960
I wasn't really diagnosed.

23:16.961 --> 23:19.563
And yet, it's your excuse
for everything.

23:19.564 --> 23:22.299
And yet, you won't
see a doctor about it.

23:22.300 --> 23:24.201
You're a recovering
alcoholic, Jeff.

23:24.202 --> 23:25.969
You'd hurt someone
while drunk last night,

23:25.970 --> 23:27.503
you'd still be
accountable for it.

23:27.504 --> 23:29.672
It doesn't mean
that it isn't true.

23:29.673 --> 23:30.874
You know? It doesn't.

23:35.212 --> 23:38.315
You wanna know
what I think?

23:38.316 --> 23:40.116
I think the demise
of your marriage

23:40.117 --> 23:42.218
was making you
feel powerless.

23:42.219 --> 23:45.088
Being naked in public was
a way to get that power back.

23:45.089 --> 23:49.826
In truth, you like making
people experience discomfort.

23:49.827 --> 23:51.795
Most exhibitionists do.

23:51.796 --> 23:54.697
That's the rush.
Until it doesn't work anymore.

23:56.067 --> 23:58.935
You amp it up. Attack someone.

23:58.936 --> 24:01.305
I think you probably got
into some kinky sex.

24:01.306 --> 24:03.707
That would account for the,
uh, rope burns on your wrist.

24:03.708 --> 24:08.679
Only last night,
things went a little too far.

24:08.680 --> 24:11.415
She got scared.

24:11.416 --> 24:12.649
So you silenced her.

24:12.650 --> 24:15.419
Unburden yourself, Jeff.

24:15.420 --> 24:16.686
You did a bad thing.

24:16.687 --> 24:18.855
Don't make it worse
by lying about it.

24:18.856 --> 24:20.624
I'm not lying.

24:20.625 --> 24:24.060
Just tell us
who the victim is.

24:24.061 --> 24:26.863
I-I never...

24:26.864 --> 24:30.233
I never meant
to hurt anybody.

24:30.234 --> 24:34.204
I swear,
I'm not a bad person.

24:34.205 --> 24:37.073
Why don't you, uh,
leave Mr. Busada and me

24:37.074 --> 24:39.509
alone for a moment,
Dutch?

24:41.179 --> 24:43.413
I ran Rios through the database.

24:43.414 --> 24:45.215
Yeah, there's nothing.
There was nothing.

24:45.216 --> 24:47.918
But today, I ran him again
and he was flagged.

24:47.919 --> 24:49.886
They put him
on a federal watch list.

24:49.887 --> 24:51.821
Bank accounts, travel
and surveillance.

24:51.822 --> 24:54.157
What kind of surveillance?

24:54.158 --> 24:58.561
Camera cops documenting his
whereabouts and contacts 24/7.

24:58.562 --> 25:00.630
Audio too?
I don't know.

25:00.631 --> 25:02.132
Vic, if he gets grabbed,

25:02.133 --> 25:04.000
I'll be the first name
out of his mouth.

25:04.001 --> 25:07.804
I need to turn myself in now
while I still have some control.

25:07.805 --> 25:10.940
Turning yourself in might clear
your conscience for a few hours,

25:10.941 --> 25:13.777
but it's not gonna stop
what Rios has planned.

25:13.778 --> 25:17.013
And if he thinks you're burnt,
he's gonna disappear for good.

25:17.014 --> 25:19.349
I can arrange a meet
to give him the fake IDs

25:19.350 --> 25:20.650
and arrest him there.

25:20.651 --> 25:22.518
That way,
I can turn myself in with him.

25:22.519 --> 25:26.389
We still could get him
red-handed. Get you out clean.

25:26.390 --> 25:28.191
What's done is done, Vic.

25:28.192 --> 25:30.260
I'll never be clean of this.

25:33.664 --> 25:36.333
Feds are running
visual surveillance on Rios.

25:36.334 --> 25:38.034
Could be audio too.

25:38.035 --> 25:39.068
Shit.

25:39.069 --> 25:41.804
Photos of me and Rios
chatting on the same day

25:41.805 --> 25:43.740
this thing goes down.

25:43.741 --> 25:45.609
It's gonna be hard
to deny involvement

25:45.610 --> 25:47.344
when we arrest him
for the Armo hit.

25:47.345 --> 25:48.645
Do we call it off?

25:50.181 --> 25:52.382
If letting Rios and his shooters
slip through the cracks

25:52.383 --> 25:54.384
means my family being safe,

25:54.385 --> 25:55.819
it's worth going
through with it.

25:55.820 --> 25:57.721
It may delay us
getting Pezuela,

25:57.722 --> 26:00.490
but at least we get Rezian
and his crew members

26:00.491 --> 26:03.126
who knew about me
and the money train.

26:03.127 --> 26:04.594
And Shane, finally.

26:04.595 --> 26:05.895
I'll call you.

26:10.001 --> 26:12.802
Who told you this?
Believe me, it's solid.

26:12.803 --> 26:15.438
With the feds watching,
Rios is of no use to us.

26:15.439 --> 26:16.906
Find a way to get
a message to him.

26:16.907 --> 26:18.642
Tell him to stay clear
of that junkyard.

26:18.643 --> 26:20.510
I'll have his men
do the job without him.

26:20.511 --> 26:23.379
We have to assume that
whatever exit Rios has planned

26:23.380 --> 26:24.947
was compromised.

26:24.948 --> 26:28.585
Gotta find another way to get
this guys out. Understood.

26:28.586 --> 26:32.121
You said earlier that you
were embarrassed to tell your wife

26:32.122 --> 26:34.591
that you were asleep
when you tried choking her.

26:34.592 --> 26:36.660
Why?
It's hard to explain.

26:36.661 --> 26:38.995
Try me.
Well, it's disgusting.

26:38.996 --> 26:42.965
That I did that in my sleep?

26:42.966 --> 26:46.436
It shows those feelings actually
exist some-- Some where in me.

26:46.437 --> 26:47.737
It must be difficult.

26:47.738 --> 26:50.840
That moment when you awoke

26:50.841 --> 26:55.244
and she said what you did
while subconscious.

26:55.245 --> 26:58.347
I'm guessing
there's a lot of shame

26:58.348 --> 27:01.384
with that loss of control.
Must be tiring too.

27:01.385 --> 27:02.786
Having to defend your actions

27:02.787 --> 27:07.223
no matter how unacceptable
may seem to other people.

27:07.224 --> 27:10.860
I thought-- Thought
about hurting Sophia.

27:12.530 --> 27:15.131
I wanted to make her pay

27:15.132 --> 27:17.400
for-- For trying to take
my daughter away.

27:17.401 --> 27:20.236
That's understandable.

27:20.237 --> 27:23.205
I know you must love
your daughter a great deal.

27:23.206 --> 27:25.442
Who thinks that about--?

27:25.443 --> 27:28.277
About the mother
of their own child?

27:28.278 --> 27:30.479
I thought
about other things too.

27:30.480 --> 27:32.381
I don't know why...

27:32.382 --> 27:35.651
My brain just goes places.

27:35.652 --> 27:37.087
Like where?

27:40.591 --> 27:43.493
Do you remember that story

27:43.494 --> 27:45.895
about the football player
in the news last year?

27:45.896 --> 27:47.831
<i>He got in trouble</i>
<i>for dog fighting.</i>

27:47.832 --> 27:51.401
<i>He put the female dogs in--</i>
<i>In a box to keep them trapped.</i>

27:51.402 --> 27:54.671
<i>So the males dogs could have</i>
<i>sex with them for breeding.</i>

27:54.672 --> 27:55.839
They called it a rape stand.

27:55.840 --> 27:58.508
I don't know why,
but I--

27:58.509 --> 28:00.610
I couldn't stop
thinking about that.

28:00.611 --> 28:02.979
I started to wonder
whether I could build

28:02.980 --> 28:05.581
one of those--
Those for women.

28:07.451 --> 28:10.253
I even made some sketches.

28:11.321 --> 28:12.922
What normal person
would do that?

28:12.923 --> 28:15.191
We can figure this out,
Jeff.

28:15.192 --> 28:18.928
And whatever you have
to tell me,

28:18.929 --> 28:21.998
the faster
we can resolve this.

28:21.999 --> 28:25.902
We can maybe even save
whoever you attacked last night.

28:25.903 --> 28:29.973
I get these flashes.
Blond hair.

28:29.974 --> 28:32.475
And young, I think.

28:32.476 --> 28:34.744
I see her screaming.

28:34.745 --> 28:36.912
I think I wanted to kill her.

28:39.684 --> 28:42.452
You're doing fine, Cammy.
Just fine.

28:42.453 --> 28:44.487
You got six cops
protecting you.

28:44.488 --> 28:45.988
<i>I'm scared, Shane.</i>

28:45.989 --> 28:48.758
Look, you're not scared,
baby. You're brave.

28:48.759 --> 28:50.459
Okay, this is almost over.

28:50.460 --> 28:51.995
<i>What time is it?</i>

28:51.996 --> 28:53.796
He's not due for
another 10 minutes,

28:53.797 --> 28:56.866
but let's keep the chitchat
down on case he's early.

28:56.867 --> 28:58.267
You're good with her.

29:02.306 --> 29:05.008
Hey, look,
I was wondering.

29:05.009 --> 29:08.444
Uh, would you tell me
what happened that night?

29:12.183 --> 29:14.918
I thought Lem told you.

29:14.919 --> 29:16.652
He did.

29:16.653 --> 29:18.288
And I just...

29:19.723 --> 29:23.093
I-I've been replaying it all
in my mind all this time.

29:23.094 --> 29:25.795
You know, what I--
What I can remember at least.

29:25.796 --> 29:29.232
And I just can't understand
how I'd do something like that.

29:29.233 --> 29:31.167
Hell, we got a 16-year-old
girl out there

29:31.168 --> 29:32.869
who's scared to death.

29:32.870 --> 29:35.771
Maybe this isn't the
right time for this, you know?

29:43.080 --> 29:45.348
Picked a bad day
to come out of hiding.

29:45.349 --> 29:47.217
I need to tell her
I'm sorry.

29:47.218 --> 29:49.619
Yeah, that should make it
all better, right?

29:49.620 --> 29:52.488
I mean, you killed her mom,
her two brothers.

29:52.489 --> 29:54.824
You almost killed her.

29:56.093 --> 29:59.128
Promise me you'll tell her
I'm sorry.

29:59.129 --> 30:00.697
Please.

30:01.765 --> 30:04.200
Make sure she knows
I mean it.

30:04.201 --> 30:05.969
You know what, buddy?

30:05.970 --> 30:07.637
Sometimes it's too late
to apologize

30:07.638 --> 30:10.573
no matter how much
you mean it.

30:10.574 --> 30:12.108
Now,
do the right thing, Gary.

30:12.109 --> 30:14.010
Confess to all of it.

30:14.011 --> 30:15.879
Maybe I'll tell Camille
you did that.

30:17.915 --> 30:19.148
Nice collar.

30:19.149 --> 30:21.050
Yeah, old-style Strike Team,
right?

30:21.051 --> 30:23.553
Yeah,
long time coming.

30:23.554 --> 30:24.954
I need a minute.

30:24.955 --> 30:27.991
Good job.

30:27.992 --> 30:29.926
Yeah, thanks.

30:29.927 --> 30:34.297
I need that guy's booking slip.
His lawyer called.

30:38.269 --> 30:41.304
Rezian get the money?
As far as I know.

30:41.305 --> 30:44.708
Okay. Just get there early,
and make sure he stays calm.

30:44.709 --> 30:45.942
Look, I know what to do.

30:49.146 --> 30:50.246
I wanna make sure

30:50.247 --> 30:52.214
that we don't miss out
on a payday, that's all.

30:52.215 --> 30:54.951
We won't, man.

30:54.952 --> 30:56.486
Okay?
Yeah.

31:06.296 --> 31:07.963
Hey, Shane.

31:07.964 --> 31:09.666
Listen, I was wondering
if you'd be cool

31:09.667 --> 31:11.601
with me stopping by
this weekend.

31:11.602 --> 31:13.203
I'd really like
to apologize to Mara.

31:13.204 --> 31:14.704
It's not necessary.

31:14.705 --> 31:15.805
I'll pass it along.

31:15.806 --> 31:17.140
Look, Shane,
I'd really,

31:17.141 --> 31:19.242
really like to talk
to her in person.

31:19.243 --> 31:21.610
I need to try to make
some peace with myself.

31:21.611 --> 31:23.680
Look, I appreciate it,
Tavon, really.

31:23.681 --> 31:24.814
I-I just don't think

31:24.815 --> 31:26.650
that Mara would be
too comfortable with it.

31:26.651 --> 31:28.985
Yeah, sure.
Sure, I understand.

31:28.986 --> 31:30.453
I mean, hey.

31:30.454 --> 31:33.189
After all, she might not have
her iron ready this time, right?

31:33.190 --> 31:34.891
What the hell is that
suppose to mean?

31:34.892 --> 31:36.026
It's like I said, man.

31:36.027 --> 31:36.993
I've been thinking

31:36.994 --> 31:38.794
about that night
for a long time now.

31:38.795 --> 31:42.565
And I, uh-- I can remember
almost everything.

31:42.566 --> 31:44.834
Everything,
except for hitting Mara.

31:44.835 --> 31:48.204
You wanna know why I can't
remember that one thing, Shane?

31:48.205 --> 31:51.207
Because it didn't happen,
did it?

31:51.208 --> 31:53.043
You must have gone
through that windshield

31:53.044 --> 31:55.244
harder that you thought.
You lied to me.

31:55.245 --> 31:56.946
And then you had to use
Lem to cover it up,

31:56.947 --> 31:58.480
so you wouldn't
get in trouble.

31:58.481 --> 32:00.049
And I'm guessing it wasn't
the first time

32:00.050 --> 32:02.285
that you had
these guys cover your ass.

32:02.286 --> 32:04.320
What's wrong?

32:05.055 --> 32:06.288
Oh...

32:08.025 --> 32:12.061
Oh, yeah, ain't got nobody
here to get your back.

32:13.797 --> 32:16.232
But now I know
who you really are.

32:16.233 --> 32:18.567
And so do you.

32:27.511 --> 32:30.780
Hey. Thought you were
headed to the junkyard.

32:30.781 --> 32:32.882
I am, I, uh...

32:32.883 --> 32:34.083
I just forgot something.

32:36.487 --> 32:39.622
Look, you know what? Um...

32:39.623 --> 32:42.291
Maybe I've been looking
at this thing from my side.

32:42.292 --> 32:44.760
Maybe you guys
would be better off.

32:44.761 --> 32:47.630
You know, with a fresh start,
without me around.

32:47.631 --> 32:49.532
It's just that, uh...

32:49.533 --> 32:51.501
I don't know that
we'll ever be able

32:51.502 --> 32:54.871
to put all this shit
behind us, man, really.

32:54.872 --> 32:59.876
So when this is done
and, uh, your family's safe,

32:59.877 --> 33:01.911
if you want me to transfer out,
I will.

33:01.912 --> 33:05.448
You do what you need to do,
but Ronnie and me,

33:05.449 --> 33:07.250
we got no axe to grind.

33:07.251 --> 33:09.052
Okay.

33:12.089 --> 33:16.392
Okay, I'll, uh-- I'll see you
on the other side.

33:20.931 --> 33:24.099
Can you believe the balls
on that guy?

33:27.337 --> 33:29.572
Hey, superstar.
How's the canvassing going?

33:29.573 --> 33:31.441
I got nothing.
No one's seen these shooters

33:31.442 --> 33:32.642
or even heard of these guys.

33:32.643 --> 33:34.910
Splitting up
has gotten us nowhere.

33:34.911 --> 33:37.046
The three of us
should roll together as a team.

33:37.047 --> 33:39.416
See if we can
shake things up that way.

33:39.417 --> 33:40.716
I wouldn't mind the company.

33:41.885 --> 33:43.386
Us either.

33:50.594 --> 33:51.994
Hey, give me a minute.

33:53.497 --> 33:56.833
You come to raid
the evidence locker?

33:56.834 --> 34:01.237
Here. I've only been
taking them for a week.

34:01.238 --> 34:03.139
I just wanted
some peace of mind.

34:03.140 --> 34:04.874
I'm exhausted, Vic.

34:04.875 --> 34:08.911
And I know I am not doing the
best job of handling all this,

34:08.913 --> 34:11.347
but it's the best
that I can do.

34:11.348 --> 34:12.849
Those kids
mean everything to me.

34:12.850 --> 34:15.418
And I don't care how many times
Cassidy screws up.

34:15.418 --> 34:18.254
I will never
give up on her. Never.

34:18.255 --> 34:23.793
So, please, don't try to
take them away from me. Please.

34:23.793 --> 34:27.397
Corrine, I'm not gonna try
to take the kids from you.

34:27.398 --> 34:28.864
How could you even think that?

34:28.864 --> 34:30.833
"We need to figure out
a new plan"?

34:30.833 --> 34:32.067
I know you, Vic.

34:32.068 --> 34:34.170
I don't have the energy
to raise these kids

34:34.170 --> 34:35.538
while I'm fighting you too.

34:35.539 --> 34:37.540
I'm begging you.

34:37.541 --> 34:40.042
You think my first move would be
to rip the kids from you?

34:40.043 --> 34:41.978
That's who you think I am?

34:41.978 --> 34:43.946
We both know who you are.

34:43.947 --> 34:46.216
Just please don't do it.

34:50.721 --> 34:53.889
Victim is Fiona Perskie, 34.

34:53.889 --> 34:55.623
She's found in a Dumpster.

34:55.625 --> 34:57.793
How far away from
where we found our guy?

34:57.794 --> 34:59.095
A few miles.

34:59.096 --> 35:01.197
He walked there without
anyone seeing his bare ass?

35:01.198 --> 35:02.865
No. It means he knew
what he was doing.

35:02.866 --> 35:05.401
He drove away from the scene,
got undressed to sell his story.

35:05.402 --> 35:07.670
Stabbed, uh, five times.

35:10.708 --> 35:13.609
We're running
some tests on the blood.

35:13.610 --> 35:16.779
But if you recognize her
as the woman you remember,

35:16.780 --> 35:20.149
you'd be doing yourself
a favor by admitting it now.

35:20.150 --> 35:24.987
Jeff, do you remember
what you did to her?

35:26.190 --> 35:28.724
I'd like to call
a lawyer now, please.

35:34.698 --> 35:36.865
We gotta stall
about five more minutes.

35:38.235 --> 35:40.103
We gotta pull Shane
out of there, man.

35:40.104 --> 35:42.138
What?
I can't do this.

35:42.139 --> 35:45.341
Vic, it's done.
It's all set up.

35:45.342 --> 35:47.576
We'll never get
another chance this clean.

35:47.577 --> 35:48.945
I don't care.

35:48.946 --> 35:51.647
It's not too late.
We still have a choice.

35:51.648 --> 35:54.484
Do you think that Shane
gave Lem a choice?

35:55.386 --> 35:57.487
I'm not Shane.

36:10.000 --> 36:11.200
Don't answer that.

36:11.201 --> 36:13.002
This will just
take a second.

36:13.003 --> 36:14.770
Hello?
- <i>Hey, baby.</i>

36:14.771 --> 36:15.838
Can you do me a favor?

36:15.839 --> 36:17.340
<i>Uh, now's not the best time.</i>

36:17.341 --> 36:19.042
<i>Can I call you back later?</i>

36:19.043 --> 36:20.843
<i>I just need you</i>
<i>to stop by the pharmacy</i>

36:20.844 --> 36:23.880
<i>and pick up Jackson's</i>
<i>prescription on the way home.</i>

36:23.881 --> 36:26.048
Yeah, sure, honey, um...

36:26.049 --> 36:27.917
I gotta go.
I'm getting another call, okay?

36:27.918 --> 36:29.619
Okay. Bye.

36:29.620 --> 36:32.221
I said no phones,
no distractions.

36:32.222 --> 36:33.856
Give it to him
or we're leaving.

36:36.159 --> 36:39.862
I see any calls to Armenia,
I'm coming after you.

36:41.431 --> 36:44.300
<i>Hey, there.
It's Shane. Leave a message.</i>

36:46.236 --> 36:49.906
Something's wrong. Shane
should be answering his phone.

36:49.907 --> 36:52.575
Hey, Ronnie, didn't, uh--?
Didn't Shane tell you

36:52.576 --> 36:54.510
he was gonna be seeing
the Armenians today?

36:54.511 --> 36:55.978
Yeah, I think so.

36:55.979 --> 36:57.480
Did he say where?

36:58.915 --> 37:00.148
No. No idea.

37:03.253 --> 37:05.320
Maybe we should roll by
Little Armenia, anyway.

37:05.321 --> 37:06.723
See if we get lucky.

37:06.724 --> 37:09.625
The captain was clear about
wanting us to stay on task.

37:09.626 --> 37:11.727
Shane should be
answering his phone.

37:11.728 --> 37:14.062
Plenty of reasons
he might not be.

37:14.063 --> 37:16.064
We're looking out
for one of our own.

37:16.065 --> 37:17.867
I'm not gonna sit back
while a team member

37:17.868 --> 37:20.035
falls off the map
in a red zone.

37:29.747 --> 37:31.781
This is taking too long.

37:31.782 --> 37:33.149
You trust
this seller of yours?

37:33.150 --> 37:35.151
Vic says it's solid,
it's solid.

37:35.152 --> 37:38.421
Trust me, we want this over
as much as you do.

37:39.956 --> 37:41.557
You know what?

37:41.558 --> 37:43.392
I'll take a look around.

38:10.086 --> 38:11.587
Shane!

38:26.036 --> 38:27.136
Who's this?

38:43.186 --> 38:45.588
He's still not answering.

38:45.589 --> 38:47.556
We pick up
the pace a little bit?

38:48.458 --> 38:49.892
<i>One Tango 13.</i>

38:49.893 --> 38:53.395
<i>Shots fired in the area</i>
<i>of 5959 Bradwell Avenue.</i>

38:53.396 --> 38:55.431
Isn't the Armo junkyard
right round there?

38:55.432 --> 38:58.367
<i>No further, Code 2.</i>

39:27.130 --> 39:29.998
Anyone else?
We just got here.

39:48.218 --> 39:49.418
Shane.
Sorry I'm late.

39:49.419 --> 39:52.688
I, uh, forgot to sign Tavon's
arrest report.

39:52.689 --> 39:54.757
Had to stop by Hollywood.

39:57.227 --> 39:58.694
No problem.

39:58.695 --> 40:00.630
Just glad you're here.

40:00.631 --> 40:01.897
How did you
get those Mexicans?

40:01.898 --> 40:03.433
Almost got my dick shot off.

40:03.434 --> 40:05.033
I know. I just got
some late intel on them.

40:05.034 --> 40:06.803
I tried to call you.

40:06.804 --> 40:08.704
Yeah, Rezian
took my cell phone.

40:08.705 --> 40:10.273
Jesus Christ, Shane.

40:10.274 --> 40:12.174
Thank God.
Yeah, no shit.

40:12.175 --> 40:13.542
I'm still shaking.

40:14.578 --> 40:17.046
I don't see any money.

40:17.047 --> 40:19.381
Looks like our Armenian
problem's solved, though.

40:19.382 --> 40:22.184
At least
your family's safe.

40:33.997 --> 40:35.464
Found a victim
for our naked guy.

40:35.465 --> 40:37.232
Woman in the Dumpster?
We already got her.

40:37.233 --> 40:39.001
Captain's working
on a confession now.

40:39.002 --> 40:40.403
No, Mission Cross
just called.

40:40.404 --> 40:42.271
Says they have a blood
match for a girl.

40:42.272 --> 40:44.006
Says she had a run-in
with a naked man

40:44.007 --> 40:46.208
after leaving a bar
late last night.

40:46.209 --> 40:48.077
I had a few
too many mai tais.

40:48.078 --> 40:51.047
I felt sick and my friend
took me outside

40:51.048 --> 40:52.314
to get some fresh air.

40:52.315 --> 40:54.015
But I tripped on the curb,

40:54.016 --> 40:56.551
and I smacked my head
into a fire hydrant.

40:56.552 --> 40:58.954
Suddenly, he just came
running up to us.

40:58.955 --> 41:00.222
Did he say
anything to you?

41:00.223 --> 41:01.757
Well, he just
stood over me.

41:01.758 --> 41:03.659
He kept grabbing on my arms
to pull me up.

41:03.660 --> 41:05.661
He was, like, naked.

41:05.662 --> 41:08.197
So, I mean,
he was a freak.

41:08.198 --> 41:11.233
I just shoved him off me,
and I ran back to the bar.

41:11.234 --> 41:14.069
Did he try to assault you
at all or act inappropriately?

41:14.070 --> 41:16.738
No. He just
gave me the creeps.

41:26.249 --> 41:29.685
Officer. Help me
open this door, please.

41:38.228 --> 41:39.829
Oh, sh--

41:42.966 --> 41:45.368
Call an ambulance!

42:00.550 --> 42:02.818
Vic.

42:02.819 --> 42:04.453
I didn't wanna wake you.

42:04.454 --> 42:05.922
You didn't.
What's wrong?

42:05.923 --> 42:11.393
I just wanted to come by and
tell you, uh, you're safe now.

42:11.394 --> 42:13.562
I, uh-- I let Carlson go.

42:13.563 --> 42:16.498
It's all over.
It's just you and the kids.

42:16.499 --> 42:18.366
Nothing to worry about.

42:18.367 --> 42:19.534
Really?

42:19.535 --> 42:22.171
Get some sleep, Corrine.
You've earned it.

42:29.613 --> 42:32.048
So the city
is countersuing against

42:32.049 --> 42:34.716
my pursuing legal recourse
for getting hurt on the job.

42:34.717 --> 42:36.885
Negligent lawsuit
or some bullshit.

42:36.886 --> 42:39.188
Then my lawyer won't take
the case without a retainer,

42:39.189 --> 42:42.324
but I can't afford the retainer
without winning the case.

42:42.325 --> 42:43.625
Nice legal system, huh?

42:44.227 --> 42:45.394
You gonna eat that?

42:45.395 --> 42:47.563
You know, Steve,
someone died here tonight.

42:47.564 --> 42:50.333
Yeah, well, the guy
sounded like a nut job.

42:50.334 --> 42:54.603
Maybe, but I missed it.
I couldn't close Lloyd either.

42:54.604 --> 42:56.339
You're having
a bad month.

42:56.340 --> 42:57.806
Happens to the best of us.

42:57.807 --> 43:00.976
I did my best work
when Claudette was my partner

43:00.977 --> 43:04.613
because she challenged
my assumptions.

43:04.614 --> 43:07.349
Forced me
to prove my theories.

43:10.720 --> 43:14.389
For better or worse,
you are my partner now.

43:14.390 --> 43:16.859
And I need the help.

43:19.329 --> 43:20.930
Okay?

43:21.898 --> 43:23.432
Yeah.

43:23.433 --> 43:24.699
Sure.

43:34.377 --> 43:36.312
Hey.

43:36.313 --> 43:37.813
You okay?

43:37.814 --> 43:39.181
Someone should call
the wife.

43:39.182 --> 43:40.549
Tina put in a call.

43:40.550 --> 43:44.386
Maybe we should, um,
talk about what happened.

43:44.387 --> 43:46.988
I'm going home, Dutch.

44:18.087 --> 44:20.189
Where you been?

44:21.591 --> 44:23.959
Looking for a place to hide
a hundred thousand dollars

44:23.960 --> 44:26.028
where Vic won't find it.

44:27.296 --> 44:29.464
One hundred thousand dollars?
My God.

44:30.800 --> 44:31.766
Where'd it come from?

44:34.237 --> 44:36.138
It's a consolation prize.

44:36.139 --> 44:37.807
For what?

44:38.975 --> 44:41.077
Vic and Ronnie
tried to kill me tonight.

44:41.078 --> 44:43.679
What?
Yeah.

44:47.083 --> 44:48.717
Are you sure?

44:50.287 --> 44:52.721
Yeah. They set me up.

44:54.191 --> 44:57.293
It's sheer luck
I'm even alive right now.

45:00.063 --> 45:01.497
And, you know...

45:05.168 --> 45:08.170
You know,
the worst part is--

45:11.341 --> 45:15.211
--is they think I'm too stupid
to even realize it.

45:16.305 --> 45:22.700
