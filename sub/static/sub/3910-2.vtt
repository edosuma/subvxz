00:02.767 --> 00:04.900
(male announcer)
Next is a Bravo scripted
original series.

00:04.900 --> 00:08.800
What news could be so urgent
that it couldn't wait one night?

00:08.800 --> 00:10.633
I mean, that's weird,
even for your family.

00:10.633 --> 00:12.000
God only knows.

00:12.000 --> 00:14.267
Something about
their trip to Austria.

00:14.267 --> 00:16.467
Well, getting a sitter
on two hours' notice

00:16.467 --> 00:19.233
is like the triple Salchow
of parenting.

00:19.233 --> 00:21.067
It can't be done.

00:21.067 --> 00:22.233
But I did it.

00:22.233 --> 00:23.533
I made it happen.

00:23.533 --> 00:25.233
[doorbell buzzes]
- Ooh.

00:25.233 --> 00:26.533
Hi, come on up.

00:26.533 --> 00:28.200
So who'd we get,
Katie or Jenny?

00:28.200 --> 00:29.700
Katie or Jenny?

00:29.700 --> 00:31.067
Hon, are you high?

00:31.067 --> 00:33.500
We're not in a position
to get a babysitter we know.

00:33.500 --> 00:34.867
We're desperados.

00:34.867 --> 00:37.367
So who the hell's looking
after our kids tonight?

00:37.367 --> 00:39.767
Someone that the Goulds'
downstairs neighbor's

00:39.767 --> 00:41.700
sitter's friend met
in improv class.

00:41.700 --> 00:44.500
[doorbell rings]

00:44.500 --> 00:46.000
Hi!

00:46.000 --> 00:47.433
Where are the kiddos?

00:47.433 --> 00:49.867
I brought toys.

00:49.867 --> 00:51.933
I bet you did.

00:51.933 --> 00:54.333
Welcome.

00:54.333 --> 00:55.900
Kids, the booby-sitter--

00:55.900 --> 00:57.567
the babysitter's here.

00:57.567 --> 00:59.433
Um, Can you pick your tongue
off the floor?

00:59.433 --> 01:00.467
We've got to go.

01:00.467 --> 01:01.500
We have a reservation.

01:01.500 --> 01:03.700
* Hey, yes, you know *

01:03.700 --> 01:06.967
* I'm feeling fine,
I'm feeling fine *

01:10.067 --> 01:13.333
Okay, we scrounged up
a sitter at the last minute.

01:13.333 --> 01:16.167
Pretty sure she's a porn star,
but she was available.

01:16.167 --> 01:19.267
What is this urgent,
thrilling news?

01:19.267 --> 01:21.433
It's official.

01:21.433 --> 01:25.067
We're not regular people.

01:25.067 --> 01:26.933
We're Vons.

01:26.933 --> 01:28.767
And so are you.

01:30.267 --> 01:31.633
- What?
- What does that mean?

01:31.633 --> 01:33.100
(Candace)
As you know, one of the reasons

01:33.100 --> 01:34.633
why we flew to Vienna
for the weekend

01:34.633 --> 01:37.133
was to explore
our family history.

01:37.133 --> 01:40.633
And we discovered that
we are direct descendants

01:40.633 --> 01:43.400
of a 16-century
Prussian duke,

01:43.400 --> 01:45.567
Ludwig Von Weber,

01:45.567 --> 01:50.200
which means we are actually
Austrian aristocracy.

01:50.200 --> 01:51.200
Rad.

01:51.200 --> 01:52.200
Oh, yay, bre--

01:52.200 --> 01:55.067
- No bread!
- No bread!

01:55.067 --> 01:56.767
Anyway, I was telling Dottie

01:56.767 --> 01:58.367
the other day
for the thousandth time

01:58.367 --> 01:59.867
that she can't pee
standing up.

01:59.867 --> 02:02.367
Jillybean, you're not
hearing the best part.

02:02.367 --> 02:06.633
We're all changing our name
to Von Weber.

02:06.633 --> 02:08.800
Ha, right!

02:08.800 --> 02:10.667
Oh, my God,
you're serious?

02:10.667 --> 02:12.533
Well, we're not
actually changing.

02:12.533 --> 02:14.200
We're restoring.

02:14.200 --> 02:16.200
Now, if a Cezanne
were chipped,

02:16.200 --> 02:17.967
it would be
restored, yes?

02:17.967 --> 02:20.567
You see, this is just
genealogical art history.

02:20.567 --> 02:22.500
(Andy)
Okay, I mean,
it's very exciting.

02:22.500 --> 02:23.867
But, I mean,
don't you find it

02:23.867 --> 02:26.867
just ever so slightly
pretentious?

02:26.867 --> 02:29.067
Is it pretentious
to call Judi Dench

02:29.067 --> 02:31.500
Dame Judi Dench?

02:31.500 --> 02:32.933
No.

02:32.933 --> 02:35.533
I redid all of Rutherford's
kindergarten applications,

02:35.533 --> 02:39.700
and let me just say...
it's good.

02:39.700 --> 02:42.367
Adding the Von could really
give the twins a leg up,

02:42.367 --> 02:46.067
which, if you
think about it...

02:46.067 --> 02:47.567
Just think about it.

02:47.567 --> 02:50.500
So I'm curious,
during your research,

02:50.500 --> 02:52.167
did you happen
to stumble upon

02:52.167 --> 02:57.100
where this Von Weber clan was
during the 1930s and '40s?

02:57.100 --> 03:00.067
You know, the tree gets a little
fuzzy in that time period.

03:03.400 --> 03:06.500
in the '60s,
which is cool.

03:06.500 --> 03:07.833
(Jill)
They're Nazis.

03:07.833 --> 03:09.267
It explains everything.

03:09.267 --> 03:10.767
They're not Nazis.

03:10.767 --> 03:13.533
Look at the antlers
on your family crest.

03:13.533 --> 03:16.733
And did you see how they
signaled for no bread?

03:16.733 --> 03:18.367
We are not changing our name.

03:18.367 --> 03:20.333
No, never, nyet.

03:20.333 --> 03:21.967
Nyet is Russian.

03:21.967 --> 03:23.233
I think you mean nein.

03:23.233 --> 03:25.567
And, honey, just playing
devil's advocate.

03:25.567 --> 03:27.400
What about the kindergarten
applications thing?

03:27.400 --> 03:31.067
These schools do pop a boner
over fancy lineage.

03:31.067 --> 03:34.133
Oh, I still have a tsunami
of applications to finish.

03:34.133 --> 03:36.200
I know it's weird
and unnecessary,

03:36.200 --> 03:37.533
but they're my family.

03:37.533 --> 03:38.833
We have to pick our battles.

03:38.833 --> 03:40.600
And at the end
of the day, sweetie,

03:40.600 --> 03:43.200
it's three letters, right?

03:43.200 --> 03:46.200
So could you just pretend
to think about it?

03:46.200 --> 03:47.467
Sure.

03:47.467 --> 03:49.333
(Miles)
Mommy, I'm scared!

03:49.333 --> 03:50.900
Oh. That's the fourth night
in a row.

03:50.900 --> 03:51.867
What the hell?

03:51.867 --> 03:53.567
Mommy!

03:53.567 --> 03:54.967
Do you want me
to go deal with it?

03:54.967 --> 03:56.967
Nein, I'll go.

04:03.200 --> 04:05.233
Everything has
to be re-monogrammed.

04:05.233 --> 04:07.700
The linens,
all three china patterns,

04:07.700 --> 04:09.667
The silver set,
the flatware.

04:09.667 --> 04:12.333
Oh, did you find
any needy W families

04:12.333 --> 04:13.733
who would appreciate
that stuff?

04:13.733 --> 04:15.133
I'd hate to just
throw it all out.

04:15.133 --> 04:18.067
Not yet, but I am
still looking.

04:18.067 --> 04:20.433
It's every bit as exciting
as you said, Brookey!

04:20.433 --> 04:21.500
I know!

04:21.500 --> 04:23.567
Confession--
I always thought Weber

04:23.567 --> 04:25.433
was a little ho-hum,
kitchen sink.

04:25.433 --> 04:28.267
That's because
it was Americanized.

04:28.267 --> 04:29.600
Oh, just think.

04:29.600 --> 04:31.667
This baby will never
have to live a day

04:31.667 --> 04:33.100
as a non-Von.

04:33.100 --> 04:34.100
Gay-men.

04:34.100 --> 04:35.533
[doorbell rings]

04:35.533 --> 04:37.867
Nicole, can you get that?

04:40.067 --> 04:41.300
The kids are doing great.

04:41.300 --> 04:44.100
Thank you for asking.

04:44.100 --> 04:45.700
Dude, you want Nicole

04:45.700 --> 04:47.733
to make you an espresso
or a smoothie?

04:47.733 --> 04:49.767
No, no, I'm good.
Thanks.

04:49.767 --> 04:52.167
It's not even 8:00.
It's like Grand Central here.

04:52.167 --> 04:54.367
I don't even notice
anymore.

04:54.367 --> 04:55.600
What's going on?

04:55.600 --> 04:57.500
You need money?

04:57.500 --> 04:58.700
Jesus.

04:58.700 --> 05:02.567
Could you please not get
all dick-swingy on me?

05:02.567 --> 05:05.233
Even if I did need money,
I wouldn't ask you.

05:05.233 --> 05:06.267
Why not?

05:06.267 --> 05:07.600
I'd do anything for you.

05:07.600 --> 05:09.833
You know how much money
you've loaned me over the years?

05:09.833 --> 05:14.367
$6,300 for your dorm-brewed
beer business at Dartmouth,

05:14.367 --> 05:15.967
not to mention all
the pro-bono legal help

05:15.967 --> 05:18.200
I gave you when that kid
nearly died drinking it.

05:18.200 --> 05:19.567
He was such a faker.

05:19.567 --> 05:21.233
He was on
life support, Lex.

05:21.233 --> 05:23.067
For, like, a day.

05:23.067 --> 05:24.233
The rock.

05:24.233 --> 05:25.533
Let's see what you got.

05:25.533 --> 05:27.167
Splash.

05:27.167 --> 05:28.433
Nice shot.

05:28.433 --> 05:30.700
So are you guys actually
gonna do this Von thing?

05:30.700 --> 05:32.067
What's your problem
with it?

05:32.067 --> 05:33.900
Splash.

05:33.900 --> 05:36.467
It just seems kind of douchey,
don't you think?

05:36.467 --> 05:38.633
It's our heritage.

05:38.633 --> 05:39.967
Look alive.

05:39.967 --> 05:41.233
Okay.

05:41.233 --> 05:42.233
Here we go.

05:44.533 --> 05:46.700
All right, well,
I've been working a lot lately.

05:46.700 --> 05:48.600
Just because some lackey
at Ellis Island

05:48.600 --> 05:50.833
was too lazy
to put the letters V-O-N

05:50.833 --> 05:52.233
on our ancestors' papers,

05:52.233 --> 05:54.600
why should our children
and our grandchildren

05:54.600 --> 05:57.300
be deprived
of their cultural identity?

05:57.300 --> 06:00.067
Plus, it sounds badass.

06:04.367 --> 06:07.567
(woman)
There is a fast-spreading wave
of overconsumption

06:07.567 --> 06:09.767
ignited by the nouveau riche

06:09.767 --> 06:13.100
and colored by our children
with a gilded confusion

06:13.100 --> 06:15.433
between mass and class.

06:15.433 --> 06:17.067
Let me get
this straight.

06:17.067 --> 06:20.800
This is like a club for
descendants of Euro nobility?

06:20.800 --> 06:22.667
No portfolio
can buy heritage.

06:22.667 --> 06:23.967
Brooke and Candace jumped

06:23.967 --> 06:25.767
at the chance to join,
of course.

06:25.767 --> 06:27.367
Now they want me
to experience it

06:27.367 --> 06:29.900
while we're considering
Von-ification.

06:29.900 --> 06:31.167
Thank you for coming.

06:31.167 --> 06:32.667
Sometimes I just
need a witness.

06:32.667 --> 06:34.967
Please, you had me
at "free food and open bar."

06:34.967 --> 06:40.100
And one can't buy
a transfusion of blue blood.

06:40.100 --> 06:41.667
I'd rather
eat my spleen.

06:41.667 --> 06:43.400
Let's go.

06:43.400 --> 06:44.767
[Jill crunching]

06:44.767 --> 06:47.333
Try the shrimp.
It's amazing.

06:47.333 --> 06:49.067
Okay, I'm dying to hear
about the new guy.

06:49.067 --> 06:50.233
What's his name, again?

06:50.233 --> 06:52.133
Timothy.
We had drinks at The Standard.

06:52.133 --> 06:53.967
- Love.
- He's into bird watching.

06:53.967 --> 06:54.967
Weird.

06:54.967 --> 06:57.333
He's also
a big baseball fanatic.

06:57.333 --> 06:58.800
- Snooze-a-roonie.
- Oh, and this is sad.

06:58.800 --> 07:00.800
His parents died
in a plane crash when he was 12.

07:00.800 --> 07:02.933
He's an orphan?

07:02.933 --> 07:04.500
Wait.
That's fantastic!

07:04.500 --> 07:07.667
A guy without parents
is a deal-maker.

07:07.667 --> 07:08.633
Marry that guy.

07:08.633 --> 07:09.933
Crack out the ketubah.

07:09.933 --> 07:11.600
I'm not getting
married again.

07:11.600 --> 07:13.067
I might not even
sleep with him.

07:13.067 --> 07:15.067
Maybe just dinner
and a little hand stuff.

07:15.067 --> 07:16.600
Okay, yum.

07:16.600 --> 07:19.467
I'm totally reconsidering
this whole Von thing.

07:19.467 --> 07:20.833
You should do it.

07:20.833 --> 07:22.067
Candace, Brooke, and Lex

07:22.067 --> 07:24.300
would have a simultaneous
orgasm if we agreed.

07:24.300 --> 07:25.267
Hi, guys.

07:25.267 --> 07:26.300
Hi!

07:26.300 --> 07:28.067
Ugh, I have to pee again.

07:28.067 --> 07:31.133
God, I hate being pregnant.
I'm Chris Christie.

07:31.133 --> 07:33.733
[sighs]
How exciting is this, huh?

07:33.733 --> 07:37.967
Gianni del Bianco is the most
exclusive spa in Europe.

07:37.967 --> 07:39.767
Even I couldn't get
an appointment

07:39.767 --> 07:41.433
in one of my last trips
to Rome.

07:41.433 --> 07:43.067
(Vanessa)
That's an outrage.

07:43.067 --> 07:45.933
I hope you told the Pope.

07:45.933 --> 07:48.267
They're offering us--
sorry, Vanessa--

07:48.267 --> 07:52.933
a day of beauty at their
first location in the States.

07:52.933 --> 07:54.867
Candace and I are booked
for next Monday,

07:54.867 --> 07:56.067
and you are coming with.

07:56.067 --> 07:58.300
Oh, that's so nice.

07:58.300 --> 08:00.800
But I can't even think
about next Monday or anything

08:00.800 --> 08:03.300
until I get the twins' school
applications in the mail.

08:03.300 --> 08:05.433
Jill, you're not
seriously putting

08:05.433 --> 08:07.133
your children's futures
in the hands

08:07.133 --> 08:09.300
of the U.S. Postal Service,
are you?

08:09.300 --> 08:12.567
Nicole is hand-delivering all
of Rutherford's applications,

08:12.567 --> 08:14.833
and I'd be happy to have
her do that for you.

08:14.833 --> 08:18.100
That's so sweet,
but it's okay.

08:18.100 --> 08:20.067
I say this with love.

08:20.067 --> 08:21.600
But, um...

08:21.600 --> 08:25.367
you're starting
to look a bit late-30s.

08:25.367 --> 08:26.600
Just from above the neck.

08:26.600 --> 08:28.200
Well, I'm 39.

08:28.200 --> 08:29.800
The neck too.

08:29.800 --> 08:31.767
You deserve some pampering.

08:31.767 --> 08:34.433
I'm gonna have Nicole
call you, okay?

08:34.433 --> 08:36.433
(Brooke)
Tootles.

08:36.433 --> 08:39.233
For Brooke,
that was really nice.

08:39.233 --> 08:40.533
A little too nice.

08:40.533 --> 08:42.733
Why do I feel like Adrianna
from The Sopranos

08:42.733 --> 08:44.133
right before
she got whacked?

08:44.133 --> 08:45.900
Well, if you don't go,
I will.

08:45.900 --> 08:47.500
I've read about
that stem-cell facial

08:47.500 --> 08:48.733
in the New York Times,

08:48.733 --> 08:49.933
and it sounds "ridic."

08:49.933 --> 08:53.367
[cell phone chimes]
- Ooh, it's Timothy.

08:53.367 --> 08:54.767
- Do you mind?
- Not at all.

08:54.767 --> 08:55.900
Lock that orphan down.

08:55.900 --> 08:57.700
You wouldn't have in-laws.

08:57.700 --> 08:59.200
Lock that Von down.

08:59.200 --> 09:02.067
I want to come back here
with a bigger purse.

09:05.900 --> 09:06.967
(Jill)
Hmm...

09:09.600 --> 09:12.600
[cell phone ringing]

09:18.067 --> 09:22.367
[ringing continues]

09:22.367 --> 09:25.933
Have not had coffee yet.
Sorry in advance.

09:25.933 --> 09:29.067
So how was date three
with the orphan?

09:29.067 --> 09:30.467
Are you engaged yet?

09:30.467 --> 09:32.533
Uh...
maybe the opposite.

09:32.533 --> 09:35.200
We took a romantic trip
to Bone Town,

09:35.200 --> 09:36.900
and I just woke up.

09:36.900 --> 09:37.933
Gone.

09:37.933 --> 09:38.900
He just left?

09:38.900 --> 09:41.567
- Who does that?
- Me, usually.

09:41.567 --> 09:43.533
I've thrown myself
down trash chutes

09:43.533 --> 09:45.233
to avoid the morning after.

09:45.233 --> 09:46.200
What's up with you?

09:46.200 --> 09:47.467
Okay, it's D-Day.

09:47.467 --> 09:49.233
Kindergarten applications
are due.

09:49.233 --> 09:51.067
And don't laugh,

09:51.067 --> 09:53.333
but I'm really torn
about this Von thing.

09:53.333 --> 09:55.233
Brooke is sending
one of her nannies over

09:55.233 --> 09:57.067
to pick up my applications
any minute.

09:57.067 --> 09:58.633
- What do I do?
- What does Andy say?

09:58.633 --> 09:59.600
You know him.

09:59.600 --> 10:01.300
He just wants
to please his family.

10:01.300 --> 10:03.633
He even printed out
another set of applications

10:03.633 --> 10:05.500
and filled them out
with "Von Weber"

10:05.500 --> 10:07.133
to try to change my mind.

10:07.133 --> 10:08.533
But every time
I reach for that pile,

10:08.533 --> 10:11.333
I feel like I'm joining
the Aryan Nation.

10:11.333 --> 10:13.233
Who's crazy this time,
them or me?

10:13.233 --> 10:14.667
Usually
it's pretty clear-cut,

10:14.667 --> 10:17.767
but, oof, that raw bar
is clouding my judgment.

10:17.767 --> 10:19.400
[knock at door]

10:19.400 --> 10:20.633
That's weird.

10:20.633 --> 10:22.367
Jill,
I'll call you back.

10:26.233 --> 10:27.367
Timothy!

10:27.367 --> 10:29.800
Hey, you.

10:29.800 --> 10:31.533
What's happening?

10:31.533 --> 10:32.733
I'm making us breakfast.

10:32.733 --> 10:34.033
What did you think
was happening?

10:34.033 --> 10:37.033
I make a mean
Spanish omelet.

10:37.033 --> 10:38.433
Wait. You didn't think
I'd just take off

10:38.433 --> 10:40.167
without saying good-bye?

10:40.167 --> 10:42.733
I've heard that happens.

10:45.367 --> 10:47.333
Oh, do you have
a 12-inch cast iron?

10:47.333 --> 10:49.400
Nonstick would work,
but I like cast iron.

10:49.400 --> 10:50.800
Better flavor.

10:54.200 --> 10:55.933
[Jill's voice warbling]

10:59.467 --> 11:03.300
Ahh!
Oh, my God.

11:03.300 --> 11:06.433
So, Jill, what happened
this morning with Nicole?

11:06.433 --> 11:07.867
She said you had a conflict.

11:07.867 --> 11:08.867
Big-time.

11:08.867 --> 11:09.867

11:11.600 --> 11:14.133
Oh, my God,
that feels so good.

11:14.133 --> 11:15.567
I'll spare you the details,

11:15.567 --> 11:18.533
but I schlepped both piles
of school applications up here,

11:18.533 --> 11:20.567
Von and non-Von,

11:20.567 --> 11:23.567
and I'm just gonna see
where the day takes me.

11:23.567 --> 11:24.733
[sighs]

11:24.733 --> 11:26.233
Will you move in
with me?

11:26.233 --> 11:28.267
If she doesn't show up
at work tomorrow,

11:28.267 --> 11:30.200
she's chloroformed
in my closet.

11:30.200 --> 11:32.067
[laughter]

11:32.067 --> 11:35.400
Jill, you're funny!

11:35.400 --> 11:36.700
You're overthinking it.

11:36.700 --> 11:38.333
It's only a name.

11:38.333 --> 11:41.533
Well, a name that has already
opened up many doors.

11:41.533 --> 11:44.133
I just got a table
at Danny Meyer's new taqueria,

11:44.133 --> 11:46.533
after weeks of trying
with no success.

11:46.533 --> 11:49.400
My point is, this is
just the beginning.

11:52.567 --> 11:54.067
Oh, my God.

11:54.067 --> 11:55.267
Jill!

11:55.267 --> 11:57.633
You look young enough
to still have your period.

11:57.633 --> 12:00.800
Oh, my, she does
look radiant.

12:00.800 --> 12:03.933
I told you they're famous
for their stem-cell facials.

12:03.933 --> 12:05.833
It's illegal
in most countries.

12:05.833 --> 12:07.400

I'm terribly sorry
to bother you,

12:14.567 --> 12:16.467
but there's a Nicole
at the desk

12:16.467 --> 12:19.867
asking for a package
she's meant to pick up.

12:19.867 --> 12:21.633

Jill.

12:21.633 --> 12:23.800
Jill!

12:23.800 --> 12:25.567
Tell her...

12:25.567 --> 12:28.633
Jill Von Weber
will be right there.

12:35.867 --> 12:37.300
Thanks again.

12:37.300 --> 12:40.967
That was the most action
that this kitchen's ever had.

12:40.967 --> 12:42.833
Oh.

12:45.367 --> 12:48.700
Is it bad that I want
to see you again really soon?

12:48.700 --> 12:51.633
- Like, how soon?
- I was thinking tonight.

12:51.633 --> 12:55.067
Oh, look at you
with no intimacy issues.

12:55.067 --> 12:57.467
Sure. Text me later.
I'll be at work.

12:59.367 --> 13:01.067
One more.

13:02.933 --> 13:05.100
Okay.

13:05.100 --> 13:06.667
One more.

13:06.667 --> 13:08.133
- Okay, but that's the last one.
- Mm-hmm.

13:08.133 --> 13:09.367
- For reals.
- Okay.

13:09.367 --> 13:11.133
I'm leaving.

- Bye.
- Bye.

to luxuriate.

14 applications

Jill, you're a hoot.

13:36.833 --> 13:39.700
Anyway, thank you so much
for including me.

This is really such a treat.

enough time together,

Yeah.

I thought you had bread.

that I still have

We got you a surprise
treatment instead.

14:14.233 --> 14:15.767
Seriously?

when I know they're coming.

I think he's in shock.

14:28.633 --> 14:31.433

Probably is.

I love being married,
but next time around,

I'm definitely not
changing my name.

I'm sorry.

but overhear.

I'm Andy, by the way.

14:45.900 --> 14:48.633
Curious, why the regrets
about changing your name?

Oh, my God,
don't get me started.

14:58.100 --> 15:00.733
Just last week,
I couldn't get on to a flight

15:00.733 --> 15:02.167
because my airline tickets

15:02.167 --> 15:03.633
didn't match
my driver's license.

15:03.633 --> 15:05.067
I went berserk.

15:05.067 --> 15:06.100
One of me is probably

15:06.100 --> 15:07.700
on a terrorist
watch list by now.

15:07.700 --> 15:09.500
Ironically, I'm thinking
of changing my name.

15:09.500 --> 15:10.833
I was going to, but now...

15:10.833 --> 15:12.400
Oh, don't listen to me.

15:12.400 --> 15:14.100
You should totally
go for it.

or doing a hybrid or...?

Whatever. It doesn't matter.

We thought it might be fun
to try out some new looks.

15:44.600 --> 15:47.067
Okay, what kind
of new looks?

15:47.067 --> 15:48.967

here and there,

caramel highlights.

18:09.300 --> 18:10.800
Oh, really?

18:10.800 --> 18:13.667
What kind of persuasion,
my tall,

18:13.667 --> 18:17.200
handsome,
aristocratic husband?

18:17.200 --> 18:19.200
This kind.

18:19.200 --> 18:21.433
(Miles)
Mommy! I'm scared!

18:21.433 --> 18:24.067
- What is wrong with him?
- He needs to grow a pair.

18:26.833 --> 18:27.933
(Miles)
Mommy!

18:27.933 --> 18:29.733
- Eff me hard.
- Oh!

18:29.733 --> 18:31.233
That's what I was
trying to do.

18:31.233 --> 18:32.867
Coming, honey!

18:35.467 --> 18:37.633
- Damn.
- Right?

18:41.433 --> 18:43.533
Hey, where are you going?

18:43.533 --> 18:44.867
Just the bathroom.

18:44.867 --> 18:46.900
Oh, no, don't go.

18:46.900 --> 18:50.400
Aw, you're cute.

18:50.400 --> 18:52.200
Really, don't, okay?

18:52.200 --> 18:53.233
Just, like, not yet.

18:53.233 --> 18:54.233
Come back.

18:54.233 --> 18:55.533
I will, in a sec.

18:55.533 --> 18:57.367
I just have to pee
and take my contacts out.

18:57.367 --> 18:58.833
You go to sleep.
I'll be right back.

18:58.833 --> 19:00.333
Okay, but, like,
really hurry back

19:00.333 --> 19:02.067
and don't even
wash your hands.

19:04.300 --> 19:07.600
Um, it's okay.

19:07.600 --> 19:09.133
I can go later.

19:09.133 --> 19:11.933
Yeah, yeah.
[pounds bed]

19:11.933 --> 19:13.567
Yes, yeah, come here.

19:13.567 --> 19:14.667
- Okay.
- Come back.

19:14.667 --> 19:15.733
- Come back.
- Oh.

19:15.733 --> 19:17.133
- Okay.
- Oh.

19:17.133 --> 19:19.433
- Okay.
- Okay.

19:19.433 --> 19:21.933
Well...

19:21.933 --> 19:23.467
This is comfortable.

19:25.233 --> 19:27.367
Hey, your timing
is perfect.

19:27.367 --> 19:29.167
I just got him to sleep.

19:29.167 --> 19:30.933
(Vanessa)
Oh, me too.

19:30.933 --> 19:33.867
So here's the thing
about this particular orphan.

19:33.867 --> 19:36.100
He has abandonment issues,
which would be fine

19:36.100 --> 19:38.167
if I didn't have
intimacy issues.

19:38.167 --> 19:40.067
Define "abandonment issues."

19:40.067 --> 19:41.867
Um, he cried when I said

19:41.867 --> 19:43.700
I couldn't see him
tomorrow night.

19:43.700 --> 19:45.667
Okay, yeah, bye-bye.

19:45.667 --> 19:48.733
Oh, so that selfie you sent
after your day of beauty

19:48.733 --> 19:50.333
was insane.

19:50.333 --> 19:52.500
Your skin looked so young.

19:52.500 --> 19:54.067
I had to hate you
for a second.

19:54.067 --> 19:57.067
Thanks, honey,
but it's not happening again.

19:57.067 --> 19:58.567
My in-laws
might disown me

19:58.567 --> 20:00.500
for rejecting
their stupid heritage.

20:00.500 --> 20:01.567
[groans]

20:01.567 --> 20:03.867
Shh, shh,
shh, shh, shh.

20:03.867 --> 20:06.600
Good night, Miles.

20:06.600 --> 20:08.933
Good night,
stem-cell facials.

20:08.933 --> 20:10.433
[laughs]

20:10.433 --> 20:12.967
Good night,
Candace thinking I'm a hoot.

20:12.967 --> 20:15.433
Good night,
Spanish omelets.

20:15.433 --> 20:18.200
Good night, best sex
I've had since Labor Day.

20:18.200 --> 20:19.667
[groaning]
No.

20:19.667 --> 20:21.667
Oh, God.
He's having a nightmare.

20:21.667 --> 20:22.767
I got to go.

20:22.767 --> 20:24.133
[Timothy muttering,
Vanessa shushing]

20:24.133 --> 20:25.367
(Timothy)
I was at the store.

20:25.367 --> 20:27.233
Good night, I love you.

20:27.233 --> 20:29.600
No...

20:29.600 --> 20:30.867
I haven't seen him.

20:30.867 --> 20:32.067
Okay, he's gone.

20:32.067 --> 20:33.400
No...

20:43.200 --> 20:45.633
[phone beeping]

20:45.633 --> 20:47.733
Hello.
I'm wondering if, by chance,

20:47.733 --> 20:50.900
you have a table
for two tonight at 8:00?

20:50.900 --> 20:52.367
Yeah, I figured.

20:52.367 --> 20:54.600
Thanks, anyway, and congrats
on the great review--

20:54.600 --> 20:56.200
[dial tone]

21:01.600 --> 21:03.533
[phone beeping]

21:03.533 --> 21:04.767
[British accent]
Yes, hello.

21:04.767 --> 21:07.067
I'm calling on behalf
of Madam Von Weber.

21:07.067 --> 21:08.867
I know it's terribly
last-minute,

21:08.867 --> 21:10.500
but I want to see
if perhaps you might have

21:10.500 --> 21:14.567
a table for two available
tonight at 8:00?

21:14.567 --> 21:17.333
You can accommodate her.

21:17.333 --> 21:19.767
Brilliant.
She'll be thrilled.

21:19.767 --> 21:21.767
Many thanks.
That's wonderful news.

21:21.767 --> 21:24.967

Oh, dear.
