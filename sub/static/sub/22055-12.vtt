00:04.590 --> 00:06.178
NARRATOR: Previously
on "Hell's Kitchen

00:06.282 --> 00:09.975
All Stars," Chef Ramsay
challenged the chefs

00:10.079 --> 00:14.186
to create the most expensivepasta dish they could on $20.

00:14.290 --> 00:15.084
What's the price on that?

00:15.187 --> 00:16.637
$5.99 a pound.

00:16.740 --> 00:17.776
NARRATOR: Back in the Kitchens--

00:17.879 --> 00:18.811
GORDON RAMSAY: Let's go, guys.

00:18.915 --> 00:20.572
NARRATOR: Elise needed
help translating

00:20.675 --> 00:22.056
her dish to Italian.

00:22.160 --> 00:23.644
I'm doing a play
on "pa-ay-la."

00:23.747 --> 00:25.025
Just stop that, it's paella.

00:25.128 --> 00:27.372
It's Spanish.

00:27.475 --> 00:30.133
NARRATOR: And Michelle was onanother continent altogether.

00:30.237 --> 00:32.791
MICHELLE: I'm making a
pork potsticker, Chef.

00:32.894 --> 00:34.620
The word "potsticker"
is not Italian.

00:34.724 --> 00:36.277
I'll make a tortellini, Chef.

00:36.381 --> 00:37.761
Thank you.

00:37.865 --> 00:38.900
NARRATOR: At judging--

00:39.004 --> 00:40.247
Thank you so much,
gentlemen, for giving

00:40.350 --> 00:41.662
up your day to be here.

00:41.765 --> 00:44.044
NARRATOR: The red teamgot off to a shaky start.

00:44.147 --> 00:46.563
It's a bit overcooked.

00:46.667 --> 00:49.497
This is kind of a problem.

00:49.601 --> 00:50.602
NARRATOR: While Robyn--

00:50.705 --> 00:51.499
Amazing,

00:51.603 --> 00:52.466
Thank you, Chef.

00:52.569 --> 00:53.536
NARRATOR: And Ben--

00:53.639 --> 00:55.434
This is the most
cohesive dish so far.

00:55.538 --> 00:56.470
Thank you, Chef.

00:56.573 --> 00:57.988
NARRATOR: Cashed in
for the blue team.

00:58.092 --> 00:58.886
$30.

00:58.989 --> 01:00.508
I would say $29.

01:00.612 --> 01:03.373
GORDON RAMSAY: $31-- greatprofit margin from a $20 cost.

01:03.477 --> 01:04.754
Thank you, chefs.

01:04.857 --> 01:06.997
NARRATOR: But strong
performances by Elise--

01:07.101 --> 01:08.068
Really delicious.

01:08.171 --> 01:10.932
GORDON RAMSAY: $93
yield on a $20 spend.

01:11.036 --> 01:12.210
Thank you.
NARRATOR: And Michelle--

01:12.313 --> 01:13.107
Good job.

01:13.211 --> 01:14.004
Thank you.

01:14.108 --> 01:15.385
$97 total.

01:15.489 --> 01:17.042
NARRATOR: Gave the
red team the win.

01:17.146 --> 01:18.871
Ladies, congratulations.

01:18.975 --> 01:20.459
Finally!

01:20.563 --> 01:21.805
Yes!

01:21.909 --> 01:24.222
NARRATOR: At dinner
service, Robyn struggled

01:24.325 --> 01:25.740
to keep her head in the game.

01:25.844 --> 01:28.881
What is going?

01:28.985 --> 01:29.779
Fuckin' A!

01:29.882 --> 01:31.815
Are you OK?

01:31.919 --> 01:33.196
NARRATOR: While Dana
struggled to keep

01:33.300 --> 01:34.680
the meat station running.

01:34.784 --> 01:36.372
Oh, my god.

01:36.475 --> 01:38.822
What a way to start
off dinner service.

01:38.926 --> 01:41.411
NARRATOR: But both teamsrecovered and were on their way

01:41.515 --> 01:42.619
to a solid service.

01:42.723 --> 01:44.483
The first to finish isgoing to win the evening.

01:44.587 --> 01:45.691
Let's go, ladies.

01:45.795 --> 01:47.797
NARRATOR: And while theblue team hit its stride--

01:47.900 --> 01:48.763
Walking garnish.

01:48.867 --> 01:50.040
Walking tortellini.

01:50.144 --> 01:53.285
GORDON RAMSAY: Go John, please.

01:53.389 --> 01:56.185
NARRATOR: The red team trippedbefore the finish line.

01:56.288 --> 01:57.324
Bam!

01:57.427 --> 01:59.119
All of the sudden, we're
at a halt. You know why?

01:59.222 --> 02:00.258
Dana.

02:00.361 --> 02:01.604
GORDON RAMSAY: All of
you in the back room.

02:01.707 --> 02:02.605
NARRATOR: The red team lost.

02:02.708 --> 02:03.951
GORDON RAMSAY: I
want you to think

02:04.054 --> 02:06.298
how your team could be strongerwithout two of you in it.

02:06.402 --> 02:07.196
Get out.

02:07.299 --> 02:08.335
NARRATOR: And nominated.

02:08.438 --> 02:11.061
Elise, Michelle,
Dana, step forward.

02:11.165 --> 02:12.994
NARRATOR: And Chef
Ramsay eliminated--

02:13.098 --> 02:14.272
Dana.

02:14.375 --> 02:16.515
NARRATOR: Ending her dreamof becoming the head chef

02:16.619 --> 02:18.483
at Gordon Ramsay'sHell's Kitchen restaurant

02:18.586 --> 02:22.556
at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas.

02:22.659 --> 02:26.318
And now, the continuation of"Hell's Kitchen All Stars."

02:26.422 --> 02:27.595
GORDON RAMSAY: Let's go.
Good morning.

02:27.699 --> 02:28.493
Let's go.

02:28.596 --> 02:29.494
[clapping]

02:29.597 --> 02:30.391
How are we feeling?

02:30.495 --> 02:31.737
ALL: Good, Chef.

02:31.841 --> 02:33.360
GORDON RAMSAY: Now,
cooking is very

02:33.463 --> 02:35.327
similar to other professions.

02:35.431 --> 02:37.157
The people who
rise to the top are

02:37.260 --> 02:39.331
individuals who
combined real talent

02:39.435 --> 02:41.299
with an incredible work ethic.

02:41.402 --> 02:45.165
Right now, I'd like you tomeet two incredible individuals

02:45.268 --> 02:46.821
who have done just that.

02:46.925 --> 02:49.203
Please welcome David and Dania.

02:49.307 --> 02:52.172
[clapping]

02:52.275 --> 02:55.623
[music playing]

02:58.316 --> 02:59.109
CROWD: Whoa!

02:59.213 --> 03:00.456
What?

03:00.559 --> 03:01.353
Amazing.

03:06.600 --> 03:07.428
CROWD: Oh!

03:07.532 --> 03:09.154
What?

03:09.258 --> 03:11.398
Dania, please, can
you come to my house

03:11.501 --> 03:14.090
and teach my girlfriend how tochange their clothes that fast?

03:14.194 --> 03:17.542
Because I'm literally waitingin the living room for hours

03:17.645 --> 03:20.717
every time it's time to go out.

03:20.821 --> 03:21.684
CROWD: That's scary.

03:21.787 --> 03:23.064
How the the hell
do they do that?

03:27.414 --> 03:28.346
CROWD: Wow!

03:28.449 --> 03:29.209
What the?

03:34.938 --> 03:35.732
CROWD: What?

03:46.398 --> 03:47.813
[cheering]

03:47.917 --> 03:50.264
GORDON RAMSAY: That's right.

03:50.368 --> 03:52.162
It's black jacket time.

03:52.266 --> 03:54.026
Come on, guys.

03:54.130 --> 03:55.614
MICHELLE: This is the dayI've been waiting for.

03:55.718 --> 03:58.307
Back in season 14, I was
the youngest person ever

03:58.410 --> 03:59.756
to receive a black jacket.

03:59.860 --> 04:01.102
Really good job.
Well done.

04:01.206 --> 04:02.138
Thank you.

04:02.242 --> 04:03.553
So moving forward,
I want to make sure

04:03.657 --> 04:05.486
that I am the youngest all starever to receive a black jacket.

04:05.590 --> 04:06.694
GORDON RAMSAY:
Absolutely brilliant.

04:06.798 --> 04:07.937
Thank you.
- Woo!

04:08.040 --> 04:08.903
[cheering]

04:09.007 --> 04:09.801
GORDON RAMSAY: Told you.

04:09.904 --> 04:11.009
it's a big one tonight.

04:11.112 --> 04:14.426
[rock music playing]

04:43.248 --> 04:48.598
Now, as you may have noticed,1, 2, 3, 4, 5 jackets

04:48.702 --> 04:50.048
stand behind me.

04:50.151 --> 04:52.637
And there are seven of you.

04:52.740 --> 04:54.777
Two of you will be going home.

04:54.880 --> 04:55.709
Wow.

04:55.812 --> 04:57.055
NICK: Oh, my god.

04:57.158 --> 04:58.781
Chef Ramsay's not playing aroundtoday in "Hell's Kitchen."

04:58.884 --> 05:02.267
We're literally going to go fromseven to five really quickly.

05:02.371 --> 05:03.924
GORDON RAMSAY: The
chefs who will receive

05:04.027 --> 05:05.822
their black jackets
today are the ones

05:05.926 --> 05:08.653
who are most
successful at facing

05:08.756 --> 05:11.483
three difficult challenges.

05:11.587 --> 05:12.760
Wow.

05:12.864 --> 05:15.832
Are you ready for
your first challenge?

05:15.936 --> 05:16.937
ALL: Yes, Chef.

05:17.040 --> 05:19.077
GORDON RAMSAY: There
will be two winners.

05:19.180 --> 05:20.181
It's a big one.

05:20.285 --> 05:22.908
It's become a "Hell's
Kitchen" classic.

05:23.012 --> 05:25.704
Any ideas?

05:25.808 --> 05:26.843
"Taste it, now make it."

05:26.947 --> 05:28.120
You got it--

05:28.224 --> 05:29.018
my favorite.

05:29.121 --> 05:29.950
Oh, man.

05:30.053 --> 05:31.400
I love "taste it, now make it."

05:31.503 --> 05:32.504
Follow me through the kitchen.

05:32.608 --> 05:33.712
Let's go.

05:33.816 --> 05:36.025
MILLY: I lost to Nick andMichelle on season 14.

05:36.128 --> 05:37.923
I've gotta get this win.

05:38.027 --> 05:38.855
GORDON RAMSAY: Are we ready?

05:38.959 --> 05:39.856
ALL: Yes, Chef.

05:39.960 --> 05:43.826
Your 45 minutes starts now.

05:43.929 --> 05:46.518
NARRATOR: In the first ofthree black jacket challenges,

05:46.622 --> 05:49.210
Chef Ramsay is having
the all stars recreate

05:49.314 --> 05:52.075
a 16-ingredient entree,
the most intricate

05:52.179 --> 05:54.837
dish he has ever presentedin a "taste it, now make it"

05:54.940 --> 05:55.769
challenge.

05:55.872 --> 05:57.633
One stunning portion--

05:57.736 --> 05:58.979
let's go.

05:59.082 --> 06:00.256
ROBYN: I'm confused by the fish.

06:00.360 --> 06:01.499
It's a little bit dense.

06:01.602 --> 06:03.121
It's a little bit dry.

06:03.224 --> 06:04.881
So I look at that
bloodline underneath.

06:04.985 --> 06:06.780
Just by the bloodline, youcan tell that's not halibut.

06:06.883 --> 06:08.057
That's bass.

06:08.160 --> 06:08.954
Fingers crossed.

06:11.957 --> 06:13.407
What fish are you gonna cook?

06:13.511 --> 06:14.304
Sea bass.

06:14.408 --> 06:15.823
I'm going to go
with bass, Chef.

06:15.927 --> 06:16.755
Yeah.

06:16.859 --> 06:17.687
What are you thinking?

06:17.791 --> 06:19.137
Bass.

06:19.240 --> 06:21.726
NARRATOR: All of the chefs havegone with the same protein, sea

06:21.829 --> 06:22.658
bass.

06:22.761 --> 06:23.797
30 minutes remaining.

06:23.900 --> 06:25.557
NARRATOR: The chefs
must now decipher both

06:25.661 --> 06:27.628
the white and Green pur es.

06:27.732 --> 06:28.836
I keep tasting
the fucking sauces.

06:28.940 --> 06:30.182
I know.
It's so fucking--

06:30.286 --> 06:32.012
It's so confusing becausemy brain's telling one thing.

06:32.115 --> 06:33.289
But I don't know.

06:33.393 --> 06:35.498
It's definitely a mentalmindfuck when you're, like,

06:35.602 --> 06:36.568
could this be celery?

06:36.672 --> 06:37.845
Or could this be cauliflower?

06:37.949 --> 06:40.538
Is it white asparagus?

06:40.641 --> 06:42.712
And the more you thinkabout it, the worse you do.

06:46.267 --> 06:47.337
Kind of.

06:47.441 --> 06:49.270
So I'm definitely still
nervous about my pur es.

06:49.374 --> 06:51.411
I did cauliflower and fava bean.

06:51.514 --> 06:52.377
I'm hoping for the best.

06:55.138 --> 06:57.106
I'm watching them tryingto figure out these pur es.

06:57.209 --> 06:59.936
But I know I've got the
correct ingredients.

07:00.040 --> 07:02.698
That green one, it was Romesco.

07:02.801 --> 07:07.012
And then the white one, Iknew exactly what that was--

07:07.116 --> 07:07.944
white asparagus.

07:10.844 --> 07:13.156
I know that people
spy in this kitchen.

07:13.260 --> 07:16.125
So I go over there,
and I grab cauliflower,

07:16.228 --> 07:17.920
just to sit it on
my station to make

07:18.023 --> 07:19.162
them think I was doing it too.

07:19.266 --> 07:20.992
Do you have any more
extra cauliflower?

07:24.064 --> 07:25.962
I'm planning on
doing a turnip pur e.

07:26.066 --> 07:27.308
But then I taste the turnips.

07:27.412 --> 07:29.069
And they're kind of funky.

07:29.172 --> 07:31.451
And there was more of a
creamy, velvety taste.

07:31.554 --> 07:33.556
And that kind of comes
from cauliflower.

07:33.660 --> 07:36.835
And for the green pur e, itreminded me of the slight

07:36.939 --> 07:39.251
sweetness that's in edamame..

07:39.355 --> 07:42.634
So I used that pur e.

07:42.738 --> 07:45.637
NARRATOR: Robyn has decided thatthe two pur es are cauliflower

07:45.741 --> 07:49.641
and fava bean, while Elise andJennifer are convinced they

07:49.745 --> 07:52.782
are cauliflower and pea-based.

07:52.886 --> 07:55.371
I think that this is thepur e instead of the peas.

07:55.475 --> 07:57.097
NARRATOR: Michelle is
going out on her own,

07:57.200 --> 08:00.721
choosing green asparagus andwhite asparagus for the pur es.

08:00.825 --> 08:02.343
14 minutes.

08:02.447 --> 08:04.276
NARRATOR: For the
final key component,

08:04.380 --> 08:08.488
the chefs must solve themystery of the complex hash.

08:08.591 --> 08:09.730
That's definitely not it.

08:09.834 --> 08:12.422
It is do or die to get
the right ingredients.

08:12.526 --> 08:14.252
I'm gonna cook
this just in case.

08:14.355 --> 08:16.461
The hash I know is some
kind of root vegetables.

08:16.565 --> 08:18.049
And I know that
there's rutabaga,

08:18.152 --> 08:19.119
fava beans, and chives.

08:19.222 --> 08:20.051
That it.

08:20.154 --> 08:21.501
I've been bringing my A game.

08:21.604 --> 08:23.295
And now I'm going
to turn up the heat.

08:23.399 --> 08:25.746
The black jacket is
mine for the taking.

08:25.850 --> 08:27.368
Look at your
options and taste.

08:27.472 --> 08:31.614
I decide that I'm going to doyams, fava beans, and chives.

08:31.718 --> 08:35.238
Every person has done "tasteit, or make it" besides me.

08:35.342 --> 08:37.309
I'm hoping first
time's the charm here.

08:37.413 --> 08:38.656
Remember how that plate looks.

08:38.759 --> 08:40.105
Yes, Chef.

08:40.209 --> 08:41.866
NARRATOR: Nick's
hash consists of--

08:41.969 --> 08:44.765
Sunroot, apples,
chives, and fava beans.

08:44.869 --> 08:46.802
NARRATOR: While the
other chefs have

08:46.905 --> 08:49.563
chosen a similar array
of fruits and starches

08:49.667 --> 08:53.153
to complete their hash.

08:53.256 --> 08:54.603
GORDON RAMSAY: Last 5.

08:54.706 --> 08:55.535
5 minutes, Chef.

08:59.124 --> 09:00.747
Damn it.

09:00.850 --> 09:02.127
My fish got a little too brown.

09:02.231 --> 09:05.337
But I'm hoping
it's not a problem.

09:05.441 --> 09:07.512
Don't leave it
too late to plate.

09:07.616 --> 09:08.651
Yes, Chef.

09:08.755 --> 09:10.135
GORDON RAMSAY: 2 and 1/2
minutes remaining, guys.

09:10.239 --> 09:11.033
2 and 1/2?

09:11.136 --> 09:12.586
Holy shit.

09:12.690 --> 09:13.725
I'm freaking out.

09:13.829 --> 09:16.107
I am just trying to get
everything on the plate.

09:16.210 --> 09:17.522
GORDON RAMSAY: 90
seconds remaining.

09:17.626 --> 09:19.420
Holy fuck.

09:19.524 --> 09:20.594
This is black jacket day.

09:20.698 --> 09:21.802
Get it together.

09:21.906 --> 09:27.774
GORDON RAMSAY:
10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5,

09:27.877 --> 09:32.502
4, 3, 2, 1, and serve, please.

09:32.606 --> 09:33.400
Oh, my god.

09:40.372 --> 09:43.168
NARRATOR: Today Chef Ramsayhas designed three challenges

09:43.272 --> 09:46.827
to determine which five ofthe seven remaining all stars

09:46.931 --> 09:49.278
will receive a
coveted black jacket.

09:49.381 --> 09:51.314
Let's hope your palates
have served you well.

09:51.418 --> 09:53.282
NARRATOR: It's now the
chef's first opportunity

09:53.385 --> 09:56.181
to advance as he judgesthe "taste it, now make it"

09:56.285 --> 09:57.217
challenge.

09:57.320 --> 09:59.184
Let's start off
with Jennifer, please.

09:59.288 --> 10:00.807
JENNIFER: I am freaking out.

10:00.910 --> 10:03.223
I'm trying to see who pickeda different fish, what color

10:03.326 --> 10:05.121
everyone's pur es look like.

10:05.225 --> 10:06.226
This is a tough one.

10:06.329 --> 10:07.192
Describe the dish, please.

10:07.296 --> 10:08.469
JENNIFER: I did bass.

10:08.573 --> 10:12.025
The pur es are
cauliflower and pea.

10:12.128 --> 10:14.165
Cauliflower and pea pur e.

10:14.268 --> 10:15.407
Yeah.

10:15.511 --> 10:16.546
Interesting.

10:16.650 --> 10:17.824
OK.

10:17.927 --> 10:20.309
MILLY: Chef Ramsay is exactlyhow like when women say,

10:20.412 --> 10:21.344
I'm OK.

10:21.448 --> 10:23.899
But you know that
"OK" is not OK.

10:24.002 --> 10:25.625
GORDON RAMSAY: Slide down.

10:25.728 --> 10:26.936
Michelle.

10:27.040 --> 10:30.526
OK, visually, looks nice.

10:30.630 --> 10:32.079
Last time I did
"taste it, now make it"

10:32.183 --> 10:32.977
I was paired up with Nick.

10:33.080 --> 10:34.012
And we won.

10:34.116 --> 10:35.635
Congratulations,
Michelle and Nick.

10:35.738 --> 10:37.084
Yes.

10:37.188 --> 10:40.329
I'm the king of
"Hell's Kitchen."

10:40.432 --> 10:41.468
Today I'm by myself.

10:41.571 --> 10:43.953
But I'm sure I'll
repeat that success.

10:44.057 --> 10:45.645
Chef, I have seared sea bass.

10:45.748 --> 10:48.440
Underneath you have a hashof rutabaga, celery root,

10:48.544 --> 10:51.271
and fava bean, and a
white asparagus pur e,

10:51.374 --> 10:54.412
and a green asparagus pur e.

10:54.515 --> 10:56.966
Tastes good.

10:57.070 --> 10:57.898
OK.

10:58.002 --> 10:59.797
All rights, Elise.

10:59.900 --> 11:00.694
Yes, Chef.

11:00.798 --> 11:03.179
Describe the dish, please.

11:03.283 --> 11:05.630
I'm sorry?

11:05.734 --> 11:07.390
Describe the dish, please.

11:07.494 --> 11:08.875
Oh, OK.

11:08.978 --> 11:10.462
I made--

11:10.566 --> 11:11.429
[laughs]

11:12.533 --> 11:15.260
--sea bass.

11:15.364 --> 11:20.610
The hash is rutabaga
and fava beans.

11:20.714 --> 11:25.201
The pur e is
cauliflower and pea.

11:25.305 --> 11:28.964
Elise's face usuallylooks something like this.

11:29.067 --> 11:31.138
But today Elise is
grabbing her face.

11:31.242 --> 11:32.830
She's looking very scared.

11:32.933 --> 11:34.659
I think she's just
unsure of herself.

11:34.763 --> 11:36.385
OK, very interesting.

11:36.488 --> 11:37.869
Benjamin, please,
bring your dish.

11:37.973 --> 11:40.700
NARRATOR: Benjamin has chosensea bass for his protein.

11:40.803 --> 11:44.117
For his hash, he's pickedcelery root, rutabaga,

11:44.220 --> 11:46.809
apple, fava beans, and chives.

11:46.913 --> 11:48.777
And for his puree he's chosen--

11:48.880 --> 11:51.607
Edamame pur e as well
as a cauliflower pur e.

11:51.711 --> 11:53.057
I think I'm the only
person who did edamame.

11:53.160 --> 11:56.474
So hopefully I'm the only onewho got the pur e correct.

11:56.577 --> 11:58.890
Top slithy toasted--

11:58.994 --> 12:01.375
slide down, please.

12:01.479 --> 12:02.514
Milly.

12:02.618 --> 12:04.551
NARRATOR: Milly has
selected sea bass served

12:04.654 --> 12:06.829
over a hash of Yukon potatoes.

12:06.933 --> 12:09.556
His white pur e is
a white asparagus.

12:09.659 --> 12:11.834
And his green pur e is Romesco.

12:11.938 --> 12:13.284
GORDON RAMSAY: It
tastes like Romesco.

12:13.387 --> 12:14.595
Back to the end of
the queue, please.

12:14.699 --> 12:15.493
Robyn.

12:15.596 --> 12:17.806
OK, fish visually looks nice.

12:17.909 --> 12:19.946
NARRATOR: Robyn has
also picked sea bass.

12:20.049 --> 12:24.605
And for the hash, she's chosenturnip, celery root, and apple,

12:24.709 --> 12:29.783
and has decided on a cauliflowerpur e and a fava bean pur e.

12:29.887 --> 12:31.889
Swap places, please.

12:31.992 --> 12:32.993
Nick, describe the dish, please.

12:33.097 --> 12:35.030
NICK: What you have
is a seared bass.

12:35.133 --> 12:37.618
Underneath is celery root,apples, and fava beans

12:37.722 --> 12:39.517
tossed with butter and chives.

12:39.620 --> 12:41.208
Around the plate, you
have a cauliflower

12:41.312 --> 12:42.140
and fava bean pur e.

12:45.040 --> 12:46.662
Wow.
Thank you.

12:46.766 --> 12:48.043
Chef Ramsay should
stop playing poker,

12:48.146 --> 12:50.700
because I couldn't
read him at all.

12:50.804 --> 12:54.256
GORDON RAMSAY: First of all,you all have nailed the protein.

12:54.359 --> 12:57.121
Let's come down to
the white pur e.

12:57.224 --> 13:00.572
Only two of you had
the pur e right.

13:00.676 --> 13:07.787
The white pur e was
white asparagus.

13:07.890 --> 13:08.684
Yes.

13:08.788 --> 13:09.685
MILLY: That's right, Michelle.

13:09.789 --> 13:12.101
Congratulations
Milly and Michelle.

13:12.205 --> 13:14.310
Thank you, Chef.

13:14.414 --> 13:16.588
Let's move onto
the green pur e.

13:16.692 --> 13:18.590
Only one of you
had that correct.

13:21.628 --> 13:25.805
And it's the first personreceiving a black jacket.

13:25.908 --> 13:29.670
And that chef is Milly.

13:29.774 --> 13:30.568
Yes!

13:30.671 --> 13:31.500
Oh.

13:31.603 --> 13:32.397
MILLY: Yes!

13:32.501 --> 13:33.329
Good job, Milly.

13:33.433 --> 13:34.710
Yes!

13:34.814 --> 13:38.472
Everybody is eating humblepie, especially Nick right now.

13:38.576 --> 13:40.405
He picked me as one
of the weakest chefs

13:40.509 --> 13:41.924
on the fucking blue team.

13:42.028 --> 13:43.823
I'd like to see Milly kindof step it up a little bit

13:43.926 --> 13:45.825
and see if he can finessewell with this dish.

13:45.928 --> 13:48.448
MILLY: And now I'm the firstperson with a black jacket.

13:48.551 --> 13:50.070
All that noise is done.

13:50.174 --> 13:51.244
GORDON RAMSAY: How
are you feeling?

13:51.347 --> 13:52.935
I feel great, Chef.

13:53.039 --> 13:55.593
Let's move on to the hash.

13:55.696 --> 14:00.149
There were five incredibleingredients in that hash--

14:00.253 --> 14:01.392
sweet potato--

14:01.495 --> 14:02.669
Fuck.

14:02.772 --> 14:08.019
--fava beans, celery root,apple with fresh chives.

14:08.123 --> 14:11.471
Two of you got four out of five.

14:14.129 --> 14:17.960
And those two are
Benjamin and Nick.

14:21.826 --> 14:25.830
The second recipient
of the black jacket--

14:25.934 --> 14:29.351
congratulations, Nick.

14:32.285 --> 14:33.148
Good job, Nick.

14:33.251 --> 14:34.045
NICK: It's been a while.

14:34.149 --> 14:35.081
But I'm super excited.

14:35.184 --> 14:36.496
I'm really proud of myself.

14:36.599 --> 14:39.464
This is just solidifying whatI worked for this whole season.

14:39.568 --> 14:40.845
And I'm ready to win.

14:40.949 --> 14:42.364
Amazing job.

14:42.467 --> 14:44.435
Benjamin, you were so close.

14:44.538 --> 14:46.851
But you burned the protein.

14:46.955 --> 14:48.335
I didn't do as
good as I wanted to.

14:48.439 --> 14:49.612
But it's like
being a quarterback

14:49.716 --> 14:51.131
and throwing an interception.I didn't get it done.

14:51.235 --> 14:52.650
But you know what?
I'm not giving up.

14:52.753 --> 14:55.308
I'm going to come backand be the top contender.

14:55.411 --> 14:56.688
GORDON RAMSAY: Congratulations.

14:56.792 --> 14:59.519
Both of you will be spendingthe rest of the day in our very

14:59.622 --> 15:02.936
exclusive black jacket lounge.

15:03.040 --> 15:04.179
CHEF: Wow, that's awesome.

15:04.282 --> 15:05.076
GORDON RAMSAY: Well done.

15:05.180 --> 15:06.284
MILLY: Thank you, Chef.

15:06.388 --> 15:08.355
Now, Nick and Milly,say goodbye and head off.

15:08.459 --> 15:09.494
NICK: Good luck, guys.

15:09.598 --> 15:11.220
GORDON RAMSAY: Some of
them you may see later.

15:11.324 --> 15:12.497
Good luck.
GORDON RAMSAY: Good job.

15:12.601 --> 15:13.395
Thank you, Chef.

15:13.498 --> 15:14.914
NICK: Good job, girls.

15:15.017 --> 15:16.777
MILLY: Woo!

15:16.881 --> 15:18.745
NICK: I fought so hard
for this black jacket.

15:18.848 --> 15:20.057
And this is the all-star season.

15:20.160 --> 15:21.955
So it's the best of the best.

15:22.059 --> 15:23.232
- Hello.
- Hello.

15:23.336 --> 15:24.130
Hello.
MASSEUSE: Welcome.

15:24.233 --> 15:25.441
Hello.
NICK: Oh, damn.

15:25.545 --> 15:26.373
OK.
Oh, this is awesome.

15:26.477 --> 15:27.271
Congratulations.

15:27.374 --> 15:28.686
Would you guys like a massage?

15:28.789 --> 15:30.067
NICK: 100%

15:30.170 --> 15:33.242
I get to sit back and chillin the black jacket lounge.

15:33.346 --> 15:35.210
I'm drinking Marino margaritas.

15:35.313 --> 15:36.142
Thank you, sir.

15:36.245 --> 15:38.109
Getting my feet
massaged, playing

15:38.213 --> 15:40.318
little mini golf-- this VIP!

15:40.422 --> 15:42.838
I was the first blackjacket on all star season.

15:42.942 --> 15:43.735
Hell, yeah.

15:43.839 --> 15:46.083
Yeah!

15:46.186 --> 15:47.394
Yes!

15:47.498 --> 15:48.982
GORDON RAMSAY: Time for
challenge number two

15:49.086 --> 15:50.121
and the opportunity
for you to get

15:50.225 --> 15:52.641
your hands on a black jacket--

15:52.744 --> 15:54.125
under each of these
five those domes

15:54.229 --> 15:56.852
are ingredients that
you will use to create

15:56.956 --> 15:59.268
a unique and delicious dish.

15:59.372 --> 16:02.202
When I ring the bell, youwill run to the first dome,

16:02.306 --> 16:04.549
grab one, and stop cooking.

16:04.653 --> 16:06.551
Obviously, you'll
need to be quick

16:06.655 --> 16:08.829
because there's limited
options under that dome.

16:08.933 --> 16:10.141
And then the bell
will ring again.

16:10.245 --> 16:13.075
And you'll grab anotheringredient from underneath all

16:13.179 --> 16:14.456
those domes.

16:14.559 --> 16:17.700
You all have 30 minutes toperfect an amazing dish.

16:17.804 --> 16:18.598
Are you ready?

16:18.701 --> 16:19.633
ALL: Yes, Chef.

16:19.737 --> 16:23.085
ROBYN: This is going
to get U-G-L-Y--

16:23.189 --> 16:24.017
ugly.

16:24.121 --> 16:24.914
GORDON RAMSAY: 1.

16:25.018 --> 16:25.846
Don't plus.

16:25.950 --> 16:26.744
2.

16:26.847 --> 16:27.883
Fucking A.

16:27.987 --> 16:28.746
3!

16:32.819 --> 16:34.131
On the count of 3.

16:34.234 --> 16:35.028
1.

16:35.132 --> 16:36.409
- Don't push.
- 2.

16:36.512 --> 16:37.720
Fucking A.

16:37.824 --> 16:38.618
3!

16:38.721 --> 16:39.653
Let's go.

16:39.757 --> 16:40.896
- Get off.
- Damn It.

16:41.000 --> 16:41.793
OK, veal chop.

16:41.897 --> 16:42.898
That fine.

16:43.002 --> 16:44.244
I'm not here to
argue with the Elise.

16:44.348 --> 16:46.212
If she wants
lobster, that's fine.

16:46.315 --> 16:47.972
It might come back to
bite her ass in the end

16:48.076 --> 16:50.285
because lobster is
really hard to execute.

16:50.388 --> 16:51.389
Now that you
got your proteins,

16:51.493 --> 16:53.012
I suggest you do
something with them.

16:53.115 --> 16:55.876
NARRATOR: It's the second blackjacket challenge of the day.

16:55.980 --> 16:56.946
Jennifer, what do you have?

16:57.050 --> 16:58.569
Airline chicken, Chef.

16:58.672 --> 17:00.812
NARRATOR: And while
Milly and Nick relax

17:00.916 --> 17:01.710
in the black jacket lounge.

17:01.813 --> 17:02.607
Oh.

17:02.711 --> 17:03.712
What the fuck?

17:03.815 --> 17:05.369
NARRATOR: The
remaining chefs will

17:05.472 --> 17:07.267
be presented with five domes.

17:07.371 --> 17:09.304
Stand by for the starches.

17:09.407 --> 17:11.444
NARRATOR: Each time Chef
Ramsay rings the bell--

17:11.547 --> 17:13.825
[ringing]

17:13.929 --> 17:15.862
--they must quickly
grab one ingredient

17:15.965 --> 17:17.381
from the uncovered dome.
- What?

17:17.484 --> 17:18.899
Well, what's the-- did
y'all grab one or what?

17:19.003 --> 17:19.969
It's fallen over.

17:20.073 --> 17:21.281
NARRATOR: And incorporateit into a dish

17:21.385 --> 17:22.662
worthy of a black jacket.

17:22.765 --> 17:24.664
GORDON RAMSAY: There itis, around the other side.

17:24.767 --> 17:25.768
Hurry up.

17:25.872 --> 17:26.873
I said stand by.

17:29.462 --> 17:30.325
What did you end up getting?

17:33.535 --> 17:34.743
ROBYN: I can think
lightning fast.

17:34.846 --> 17:36.469
So I feel like thischallenge is perfect for me.

17:36.572 --> 17:39.748
But whoa-- sweet potato.

17:39.851 --> 17:40.852
Like, that's the name of my cat.

17:40.956 --> 17:42.130
[meowing]

17:42.233 --> 17:43.717
Hopefully, whatever'sunderneath that dome 3 is gonna

17:43.821 --> 17:45.236
get me rocking and rolling.

17:45.340 --> 17:46.341
Can you open this
for me, please?

17:46.444 --> 17:47.273
Yeah, of course.

17:47.376 --> 17:48.481
Honey, yeah?

17:48.584 --> 17:49.723
Just a little bit.

17:49.827 --> 17:51.725
NARRATOR: Stand by
for the third dome.

17:51.829 --> 17:53.106
[ringing]

17:56.040 --> 17:57.490
Whoa.
Uh.

17:57.593 --> 17:58.353
Yeah, you can have that.

17:58.456 --> 17:59.285
Fuck.

17:59.388 --> 18:00.424
I'll take the leeks.

18:00.527 --> 18:01.942
JENNIFER: You guys are
making this easy here.

18:02.046 --> 18:03.772
You're giving me
good ingredients.

18:03.875 --> 18:05.601
This is like a Sunday
dinner right now.

18:05.705 --> 18:07.431
Chicken, potatoes
and broccolini--

18:07.534 --> 18:09.018
I can't go wrong with this.

18:09.122 --> 18:11.745
7 minutes gone, 23
minutes remaining.

18:11.849 --> 18:13.471
What the fuck?

18:13.575 --> 18:15.784
All of my ingredients
are really odd.

18:15.887 --> 18:17.648
With the leaks, I don'treally know what I'm doing.

18:17.751 --> 18:22.411
Fu-- So I kind of just have
to go with my gut here.

18:22.515 --> 18:24.068
I don't even know.

18:24.172 --> 18:25.552
[ringing]

18:28.383 --> 18:29.177
No.

18:29.280 --> 18:30.488
This one.

18:30.592 --> 18:32.076
ELISE: You have to be quickon your feet in thinking,

18:32.180 --> 18:33.353
like, what am I going to grab?

18:33.457 --> 18:35.390
And I thrive under
that type of pressure.

18:35.493 --> 18:36.598
Elise, what did you get?

18:36.701 --> 18:38.151
Parmesan cheese.GORDON RAMSAY: Parmesan, wow.

18:38.255 --> 18:39.256
Yep.

18:39.359 --> 18:40.602
Because if I don't make
it to black jackets,

18:40.705 --> 18:42.190
I'm not going to have a chanceto shine as an individual,

18:42.293 --> 18:44.019
which is my strongest suit.

18:44.123 --> 18:44.916
I'm going to wait.

18:48.920 --> 18:49.783
Benjamin, what did you get?

18:49.887 --> 18:50.750
Truffles, Chef.

18:50.853 --> 18:52.096
GORDON RAMSAY: Oh,
my goodness me--

18:52.200 --> 18:53.201
whole [inaudible] truffle.

18:53.304 --> 18:54.133
Oui, Chef.

18:54.236 --> 18:55.410
Who doesn't love
fucking truffles?

18:55.513 --> 18:56.790
I mean, they're amazing.

18:56.894 --> 18:58.413
I love my dish-- very excited.

18:58.516 --> 19:00.000
This is like the
challenge made for me.

19:00.104 --> 19:01.485
I do this at the
restaurant all the time.

19:01.588 --> 19:03.728
I'm always making specialrequests for our guests.

19:03.832 --> 19:05.144
So I feel great.

19:05.247 --> 19:06.938
One more dome to go.

19:07.042 --> 19:08.319
[ringing]

19:12.012 --> 19:12.806
Uh!

19:12.910 --> 19:13.704
I got it.

19:13.807 --> 19:15.326
No, I got it.

19:15.430 --> 19:16.431
I had my hands on it first.

19:16.534 --> 19:17.742
My hand is in the bowl.

19:17.846 --> 19:19.261
ROBYN: I had my hands on itfirst, sun-dried tomatoes.

19:19.365 --> 19:20.366
Sorry, Robyn.

19:20.469 --> 19:21.919
I'm not giving up these
sun-dried tomatoes.

19:22.022 --> 19:23.990
They are definitely
meant for my dish.

19:24.093 --> 19:25.578
GORDON RAMSAY: 3
minutes remaining.

19:25.681 --> 19:26.958
Phew.

19:27.062 --> 19:27.890
Wha--

19:27.994 --> 19:29.098
Robyn, you happy
with your dish?

19:29.202 --> 19:29.996
ROBYN: Yes.

19:30.099 --> 19:32.481
We're chefs.

19:32.585 --> 19:35.415
GORDON RAMSAY: 90 secondsremaining-- time to plate.

19:40.834 --> 19:47.496
5, 4, 3, 2, 1, and stop.

19:47.600 --> 19:51.051
OK, time to find out who'sgoing to join Milly and Nick

19:51.155 --> 19:53.744
in that black jacket lounge.

19:53.847 --> 19:55.263
Let's start with Robyn.

19:55.366 --> 19:56.471
Bring the dish down, please.

19:56.574 --> 19:58.300
ROBYN: I've waited
5 and 1/2 years

19:58.404 --> 20:00.268
to get another black jacket.

20:00.371 --> 20:02.684
And all the motions
after creating this dish

20:02.787 --> 20:03.616
has just hit me.

20:03.719 --> 20:06.066
It's like, this is real.

20:06.170 --> 20:08.276
This is really, really real.

20:08.379 --> 20:10.174
I have a pan-seared
Chilean sea bass

20:10.278 --> 20:12.797
with sweet potato,
corn, and aloe hash

20:12.901 --> 20:13.867
with a little bit of honey.

20:13.971 --> 20:15.110
Why honey?

20:15.214 --> 20:17.492
I just wanted to elevatethe little bit sweetness

20:17.595 --> 20:19.356
to balance out the saffron.

20:19.459 --> 20:20.702
But you got
sweet potato pur e.

20:20.805 --> 20:21.599
Yes.

20:21.703 --> 20:22.566
Which is what?

20:22.669 --> 20:23.981
Sweet.

20:24.084 --> 20:25.016
It's a really strong effort.

20:25.120 --> 20:25.914
Wow.

20:26.017 --> 20:27.156
Benjamin, slide down, please.

20:27.260 --> 20:29.228
NARRATOR: Benjamin ispresenting a filet mignon

20:29.331 --> 20:31.540
with braised Swiss
chard and cauliflower,

20:31.644 --> 20:32.714
topped with truffles.

20:32.817 --> 20:36.131
That is beautiful.

20:36.235 --> 20:37.926
What I'd change--
a little less heavy

20:38.029 --> 20:38.996
on the reduction of the sauce.

20:39.099 --> 20:39.893
BENJAMIN: Yes, Chef.

20:39.997 --> 20:41.826
But filet-- nailed.

20:41.930 --> 20:42.724
Pretty good leave.

20:42.827 --> 20:44.553
Thank, you Chef.

20:44.657 --> 20:46.486
GORDON RAMSAY: Jennifer.

20:46.590 --> 20:49.075
NARRATOR: Next up is Jenniferwith her airline chicken,

20:49.178 --> 20:50.697
potatoes, and broccolini dish.

20:50.801 --> 20:52.285
GORDON RAMSAY: Chickencooked beautifully-- love

20:52.389 --> 20:55.323
that lemony fresh lightness.

20:55.426 --> 20:58.257
But I've got potatoeshere that are undercooked.

20:58.360 --> 20:59.741
Damn.

20:59.844 --> 21:01.363
I thought they
were cooked, Chef.

21:01.467 --> 21:03.365
Undercooked potato-- no go.

21:03.469 --> 21:05.712
JENNIFER: Why did you
put untasted potatoes

21:05.816 --> 21:06.610
on your plate, Jennifer?

21:06.713 --> 21:09.164
You're a fucking chooch.

21:09.268 --> 21:11.787
NARRATOR: Michelle has preparedan elaborately seasoned veal

21:11.891 --> 21:13.755
chop with couscous and leeks.

21:13.858 --> 21:15.032
GORDON RAMSAY: Great
sear on the chop.

21:15.135 --> 21:16.067
Thank you, Chef.

21:16.171 --> 21:17.206
GORDON RAMSAY: What's
the rub on that?

21:17.310 --> 21:18.104
Because it's got that
spicy fragrant there.

21:18.207 --> 21:19.312
What is that?

21:19.416 --> 21:22.591
Cardamom, cumin,coriander, salt, pepper, lots

21:22.695 --> 21:24.490
of different spices.

21:24.593 --> 21:27.941
I haven't gone too crazy withspices yet in this competition.

21:28.045 --> 21:29.357
And I feel like
in this challenge,

21:29.460 --> 21:30.841
it's really going
to help me win.

21:30.944 --> 21:32.221
That's a really good
dish-- really good.

21:32.325 --> 21:33.395
- Thank you, Chef.
- Thank you.

21:33.499 --> 21:35.742
Good job, man Michelle.

21:35.846 --> 21:37.710
GORDON RAMSAY: Finally,
Elise, let's go, please.

21:37.813 --> 21:39.539
ELISE: I do believe
that I am the strongest

21:39.643 --> 21:40.920
member of the red team.

21:41.023 --> 21:42.853
And one of us has tomake it to black jackets.

21:42.956 --> 21:44.682
But I'm hoping it's me.

21:44.786 --> 21:46.615
NARRATOR: Elise has
served a poached lobster

21:46.719 --> 21:49.066
tail with Parmesan
rice and asparagus.

21:49.169 --> 21:50.895
Visually, there's
something on that plate

21:50.999 --> 21:51.793
that doesn't sit right.

21:51.896 --> 21:52.897
Can anyone see it?

21:53.001 --> 21:53.760
Take a close look.

21:56.694 --> 21:57.937
Oh, my god.

21:58.040 --> 22:00.629
So it's got its shit sack there.

22:00.733 --> 22:05.116
And that's the poop sack thatyou do not want to crunch on.

22:05.220 --> 22:07.705
One tiny sack of
shit can destroy

22:07.809 --> 22:10.846
the flavor of a $60 lobster.

22:10.950 --> 22:11.951
Oh, my god.

22:12.054 --> 22:13.228
Elise, you need to
come up to New England

22:13.332 --> 22:14.781
to learn how to
break down a lobster

22:14.885 --> 22:18.371
because you do not leavethe poop sack in a lobster.

22:18.475 --> 22:21.132
It's not edible.

22:21.236 --> 22:22.341
GORDON RAMSAY: What a shame.

22:22.444 --> 22:23.790
Thank you.

22:23.894 --> 22:25.102
Boop.

22:25.205 --> 22:27.104
That's what I think
about Elise's lobster.

22:27.207 --> 22:29.071
GORDON RAMSAY: The firstrecipient of a black jacket

22:29.175 --> 22:32.385
and joining Milly and Nick inthe VIP black jacket lounge--

22:35.940 --> 22:39.461
The next black jacketis mine, fingers crossed,

22:39.565 --> 22:40.807
hoping, hoping, hoping.

22:40.911 --> 22:45.018
Congratulations, Michelle.

22:45.122 --> 22:46.295
Yes!

22:46.399 --> 22:47.193
GORDON RAMSAY: Amazing.

22:47.296 --> 22:48.297
Congratulations.

22:48.401 --> 22:49.471
MICHELLE: Thank you, Chef.

22:49.575 --> 22:50.886
Woo!

22:50.990 --> 22:51.818
Yay!

22:51.922 --> 22:54.027
I got a black jacket, finally.

22:54.131 --> 22:55.028
Congratulations, great job.

22:55.132 --> 22:56.098
Thank you, Chef.

22:56.202 --> 22:57.341
MICHELLE: I'm the
third person to get

22:57.445 --> 22:59.412
a black jacket overall,first person on the red team

22:59.516 --> 23:00.413
to get a black jacket.

23:00.517 --> 23:01.621
GORDON RAMSAY:
Michelle, to the lounge.

23:01.725 --> 23:02.933
You do not want to
miss a minute there.

23:03.036 --> 23:04.106
Good luck, y'all.

23:04.210 --> 23:06.143
And I'm just so proud
and relieved right now.

23:06.246 --> 23:07.558
I'm just ecstatic.

23:08.559 --> 23:11.010
Yeah!

23:12.011 --> 23:13.909
Yes!

23:14.013 --> 23:15.808
We straight up--
we like Michelle!

23:15.911 --> 23:16.740
Yo, you out here.

23:16.843 --> 23:18.224
Season 14 right here!

23:18.327 --> 23:20.191
[cheering]

23:21.814 --> 23:23.229
GORDON RAMSAY:
The person joining

23:23.332 --> 23:26.853
Michelle, Nick, Millie
in the black jacket

23:26.957 --> 23:28.441
lounge-- congratulations.

23:35.586 --> 23:37.554
NARRATOR: In the second
of three challenges--

23:37.657 --> 23:39.797
[cheering]

23:39.901 --> 23:43.939
Michelle has just earned her wayinto the black jacket lounge.

23:44.043 --> 23:46.286
With Jennifer's
potatoes being raw--

23:46.390 --> 23:47.909
Undercooked potato-- no go.

23:48.012 --> 23:50.118
NARRATOR: And Elise'sblunder with her lobster--

23:50.221 --> 23:52.707
GORDON RAMSAY: So it's
got its shit sack there.

23:52.810 --> 23:54.467
NARRATOR: Chef Ramsay
is now deciding

23:54.571 --> 23:56.676
between Benjamin
and Robyn on who

23:56.780 --> 23:58.954
gets the fourth black jacket.

23:59.058 --> 24:06.928
Congratulations, Benjamin.

24:07.031 --> 24:08.308
- Thank you, Chef.
- Great job.

24:08.412 --> 24:09.240
Solid.

24:09.344 --> 24:10.897
I think that
black jacket shows

24:11.001 --> 24:12.278
that you're here for business.

24:12.381 --> 24:14.625
You know, everybody with a blackjacket right now is no joke.

24:14.729 --> 24:16.593
And we're here to
win this competition.

24:16.696 --> 24:18.871
Elise, Jennifer, Robyn,
head for the patio.

24:18.974 --> 24:20.666
Wait for your final challenge.

24:20.769 --> 24:22.115
Oh, who the fuck is that?

24:22.219 --> 24:23.013
Oh, shit.

24:23.116 --> 24:24.670
[cheering]

24:24.773 --> 24:25.878
Yeah, look at that.

24:25.981 --> 24:27.362
My bro!

24:27.466 --> 24:28.328
Yes!

24:28.432 --> 24:29.778
Congratulations!

24:29.882 --> 24:31.262
Damn.

24:31.366 --> 24:33.161
Damn, I'm so happy for you, bro.

24:37.717 --> 24:40.617
[crying]

24:41.652 --> 24:43.447
I don't get it.

24:44.586 --> 24:48.107
You have to beat her.

24:48.210 --> 24:51.213
To only have one spot left--

24:51.317 --> 24:53.561
you know, if I
don't get it, then

24:53.664 --> 24:57.323
I hope Robyn gets it
because, you know,

24:57.426 --> 24:58.945
they always say nice
guys finish last.

24:59.049 --> 25:01.085
So hopefully the nice
guys finish first.

25:13.822 --> 25:15.341
It wasn't supposed to
come down to Jennifer

25:15.444 --> 25:16.860
or I getting a black jacket.

25:16.963 --> 25:17.861
[sighing]

25:17.964 --> 25:19.656
JENNIFER: This fucking sucks.

25:19.759 --> 25:21.968
I respect Jennifer so much.

25:22.072 --> 25:25.040
And to have to go against herlike this, this is really hard.

25:25.144 --> 25:25.972
[crying]

25:27.008 --> 25:28.009
Sorry Jennifer, I love you.

25:28.112 --> 25:31.495
But I want this more.

25:31.599 --> 25:36.017
GORDON RAMSAY: Ladies, thereis only one black jacket left.

25:36.120 --> 25:38.398
That means only one of
you will be moving on.

25:38.502 --> 25:40.711
ELISE: I need to focus becauseI put everything on the line

25:40.815 --> 25:41.816
for a second chance.

25:41.919 --> 25:43.680
And I didn't
sacrifice everything

25:43.783 --> 25:45.336
to come here for no reason.

25:45.440 --> 25:46.579
GORDON RAMSAY: Here's
the challenge--

25:46.683 --> 25:48.547
it could be anything you want.

25:48.650 --> 25:50.652
You have total freedom.

25:50.756 --> 25:53.206
So it needs to be somethingreally impressive.

25:53.310 --> 25:54.104
Understood?

25:54.207 --> 25:55.623
ALL: Yes, Chef.

25:55.726 --> 25:57.452
GORDON RAMSAY: You've
all got 30 minutes.

25:57.556 --> 26:00.006
And your time starts now.

26:00.110 --> 26:01.594
Let's go.

26:01.698 --> 26:03.389
30 minutes to
cook the dish that's

26:03.492 --> 26:04.632
going to change my life--

26:04.735 --> 26:06.185
I just need to focus.

26:06.288 --> 26:08.532
And I need to cook
my ass off right now.

26:08.636 --> 26:10.223
Anything you wish--

26:10.327 --> 26:13.261
something special.

26:13.364 --> 26:14.158
MICHELLE: Oh, what is it?

26:14.262 --> 26:15.884
What is it?
- Oh, damn.

26:15.988 --> 26:17.541
BENJAMIN: Oh, baby.
MICHELLE: Oh, my god.

26:17.645 --> 26:19.060
BENJAMIN: It's on, guys.
This is awesome.

26:19.163 --> 26:19.992
Yay!

26:20.095 --> 26:21.338
We get to watch this one.

26:21.441 --> 26:22.684
Look at all those
ingredients they have.

26:22.788 --> 26:23.685
NICK: That's a lot of food.

26:23.789 --> 26:24.583
MILLY: Oh, my god.

26:24.686 --> 26:26.205
That's a lot of food, man.

26:26.308 --> 26:27.137
NICK: Robyn, be smart.

26:27.240 --> 26:28.103
What is she doing?

26:28.207 --> 26:29.104
That's going to fuck her up.

26:29.208 --> 26:30.485
She has too many options.

26:30.589 --> 26:32.038
NICK: Yeah, it's easy to puttoo many things on the plate.

26:32.142 --> 26:33.833
You've got to come up
with something goofy.

26:33.937 --> 26:35.559
You've got to show that
you deserve to be here.

26:35.663 --> 26:37.526
And two of them dropping.

26:37.630 --> 26:39.287
Yeah, only one of themis going to survive this.

26:39.390 --> 26:40.288
BENJAMIN: That's awesome.

26:40.391 --> 26:40.909
MICHELLE: It better
not be Elise.

26:44.085 --> 26:46.605
ELISE: There's like 1,000ingredients on the table.

26:46.708 --> 26:50.332
And I have so many ideas butcan't really hone in on one.

26:50.436 --> 26:51.989
What dish are
you doing, Elise?

26:52.093 --> 26:54.474
Um.

26:54.578 --> 26:55.475
come back to me.

26:55.579 --> 26:56.373
Come back, yeah?

26:56.476 --> 26:57.270
Yeah.

26:57.374 --> 26:58.686
I fought my way to get here.

26:58.789 --> 27:01.585
And now I find myself
up against the wall.

27:01.689 --> 27:04.208
And with one black jacketleft, I'm upset with myself

27:04.312 --> 27:06.003
that I'm even in this position.

27:06.107 --> 27:08.592
But I want this
more than anything.

27:08.696 --> 27:09.938
I'm just fighting for my life.

27:10.042 --> 27:12.492
ROBYN: Do we not have jalape os?

27:12.596 --> 27:14.805
Chef Ramsay's like,
make what you want.

27:14.909 --> 27:16.600
But there's so many
ingredients right now.

27:16.704 --> 27:17.843
Oh, no.

27:17.946 --> 27:19.051
Too many choices are scary.

27:19.154 --> 27:20.708
What are you gonna--what are you going to make?

27:20.811 --> 27:23.607
ROBYN: I'm going
back to a halibut

27:23.711 --> 27:24.953
with a mango beurre blanc.

27:25.057 --> 27:26.817
I'm gonna finish it with achimichurri sauce and a salsa.

27:29.751 --> 27:31.373
What dish are you
doing, Jennifer?

27:31.477 --> 27:34.307
A corn succotash
with seared scallops,

27:34.411 --> 27:36.620
shrimp, and a paprika butter.

27:36.724 --> 27:38.139
I'm going with this
dish because it's

27:38.242 --> 27:39.865
something I do all the time.

27:39.968 --> 27:42.833
I'm going to go withwhat I know, what I love.

27:42.937 --> 27:44.283
This is how I'm going
to win my jacket.

27:44.386 --> 27:46.423
I'm going to cook
from the heart.

27:46.526 --> 27:48.011
MILLY: Come on, Jenn.
- Yes, Jenn.

27:48.114 --> 27:49.012
Get that corn.

27:49.115 --> 27:50.082
She books focused.

27:50.185 --> 27:51.255
She looks like she
knows what she's doing.

27:51.359 --> 27:52.636
NICK: Jenn looks fine.

27:52.740 --> 27:53.879
So far, Jenn's ingredientsseem the most cohesive to me.

27:53.982 --> 27:55.466
Elise looks confused.
MICHELLE: Look at her.

27:55.570 --> 27:56.502
She's just staring.

27:56.605 --> 27:58.538
You need to be doing
something, Elise.

27:58.642 --> 27:59.608
She seems upset.

27:59.712 --> 28:00.920
Yeah, her last
round was super bad.

28:01.024 --> 28:01.818
That sucks.

28:01.921 --> 28:02.819
No, it doesn't.

28:02.922 --> 28:03.889
Oh, my god.

28:03.992 --> 28:05.235
She's putting her
potatoes in the Vitamix.

28:05.338 --> 28:06.201
NICK: Oh, no.
They're

28:06.305 --> 28:08.617
MICHELLE: Gonna
be gummy as fuck.

28:08.721 --> 28:09.515
Nope, they're done.

28:09.618 --> 28:10.550
Gummy-- they're already gummy.

28:10.654 --> 28:11.448
NICK: That's bad.

28:15.901 --> 28:20.526
Culinary 101 has gone
out of Elise's brain.

28:20.629 --> 28:22.701
Elise is cracking
under this pressure.

28:22.804 --> 28:25.980
And I couldn't be happier.

28:26.083 --> 28:28.016
GORDON RAMSAY: 10 minutes gone--

28:28.120 --> 28:29.880
just under 20 minutes remaining.

28:29.984 --> 28:31.088
ROBYN: Yes, Chef.

28:31.192 --> 28:33.539
GORDON RAMSAY: Somethingspecial, something unique.

28:33.642 --> 28:34.816
ROBYN: I changed it.

28:34.920 --> 28:35.714
You changed?

28:35.817 --> 28:37.301
ROBYN: Yes, lamb loin.

28:37.405 --> 28:38.440
Lamb loin?

28:38.544 --> 28:39.441
GORDON RAMSAY: What
did you start off with?

28:39.545 --> 28:40.580
I started off with halibut.

28:40.684 --> 28:41.927
But I'm more confident
with this now, Chef.

28:42.030 --> 28:43.376
You're changing your protein.

28:43.480 --> 28:44.550
Yes, Chef.

28:44.653 --> 28:46.000
I started with halibut
because I'm like, yo,

28:46.103 --> 28:47.346
I really kick ass cooking fish.

28:47.449 --> 28:48.796
But I'm like, you know what?

28:48.899 --> 28:49.866
Forget that.

28:49.969 --> 28:51.453
I'm going to step
out of my box and use

28:51.557 --> 28:53.214
a really hard meat
to cook so I can

28:53.317 --> 28:55.595
execute that protein perfect.

28:55.699 --> 28:57.183
And who the hell changes
their dish when they're

28:57.287 --> 28:58.944
already 10 minutes into it?

28:59.047 --> 28:59.979
I do.

29:00.083 --> 29:01.118
You've got 18 and
1/2 minutes to go.

29:01.222 --> 29:02.050
MICHELLE: Shit.

29:02.154 --> 29:03.224
They don't have a lot of time.

29:03.327 --> 29:04.984
Focus Robyn.
MILLY: Calm down.

29:05.088 --> 29:05.882
NICK: I know.

29:05.985 --> 29:06.848
Calm down, Robyn.

29:06.952 --> 29:08.125
I thought she was
making halibut.

29:08.229 --> 29:09.057
[gasps]

29:09.161 --> 29:10.300
What's she doing?

29:10.403 --> 29:11.404
She changed her protein.

29:11.508 --> 29:12.716
MILLY: With 20 minutes left?

29:12.820 --> 29:13.613
She thought too much.

29:13.717 --> 29:14.994
It's over now.

29:15.098 --> 29:16.651
NICK: I hope she's not doingmango beurre blanc with lamb.

29:16.755 --> 29:19.412
Changing proteinsmid-challenge is very risky.

29:19.516 --> 29:21.552
There's kind of a
fine line between just

29:21.656 --> 29:23.485
being stupid and taking a risk.

29:23.589 --> 29:24.832
I'm nervous for them.BENJAMIN: 15 minutes left--

29:24.935 --> 29:25.971
14 minutes left--
14.

29:26.074 --> 29:27.317
MILLY: Whoa!

29:27.420 --> 29:29.284
NICK: This is scaring me.

29:29.388 --> 29:30.561
They need to finish.

29:30.665 --> 29:31.735
Have you thought
of your dish yet?

29:31.839 --> 29:32.943
Yeah, I thought of
it the whole time.

29:33.047 --> 29:33.979
I just didn't want to talk.- Go on.

29:34.082 --> 29:35.152
Tell me.
Speak to me.

29:35.256 --> 29:38.224
I'm making a
pan-seared filet mignon.

29:38.328 --> 29:39.156
Yep.

29:39.260 --> 29:40.088
Rainbow Swiss chard.

29:40.192 --> 29:41.331
Yep.

29:41.434 --> 29:45.749
Mushroom duxelle andchive mascarpone whipped.

29:45.853 --> 29:46.646
potato.

29:46.750 --> 29:47.544
Whipped potato.

29:47.647 --> 29:48.683
Potato pur e-- potato pur e.

29:48.787 --> 29:50.961
Robyn, she hasn't done
anything remarkable.

29:51.065 --> 29:53.446
And Jennifer's not vocal enough.

29:53.550 --> 29:54.516
And she doesn't
know how to lead.

29:58.382 --> 29:59.590
Robyn, your corn fell off.

29:59.694 --> 30:00.695
I just put it back on.

30:00.799 --> 30:01.800
Thank you.

30:01.903 --> 30:04.664
ELISE: Jennifer and
Robyn, they're a clique.

30:04.768 --> 30:05.942
I don't need someone
to cheer me on.

30:06.045 --> 30:08.530
I don't need someone to dragme across the finish line.

30:08.634 --> 30:10.670
I'm going to sprint to thefinish line and beat you there.

30:10.774 --> 30:11.844
I don't need a clique.

30:11.948 --> 30:13.501
GORDON RAMSAY: 90 seconds, guys.Ooh.

30:13.604 --> 30:14.398
ELISE: How much?

30:14.502 --> 30:15.641
ALL: 90 seconds.

30:15.744 --> 30:17.091
90, 90, 90.

30:17.194 --> 30:18.264
Get your plate ready.

30:18.368 --> 30:19.265
I need a bit more thyme.

30:27.308 --> 30:28.896
NARRATOR: Elise,
Jennifer, and Robyn

30:28.999 --> 30:31.001
are cooking for their
lives in the last

30:31.105 --> 30:32.451
of today's three challenges.

30:32.554 --> 30:33.866
GORDON RAMSAY: Let's go.

30:33.970 --> 30:36.420
NARRATOR: It is their finalchance to earn a black jacket.

30:36.524 --> 30:37.525
GORDON RAMSAY: 90 seconds, guys.

30:37.628 --> 30:38.422
How much?

30:38.526 --> 30:40.148
ALL: 90 seconds.

30:40.252 --> 30:42.185
NARRATOR: Nick, Benjamin,Michelle, and Milly

30:42.288 --> 30:44.773
already earned theirs
and are watching along

30:44.877 --> 30:46.396
from the black jacket lounge.

30:46.499 --> 30:47.811
I need a bit more thyme.

30:47.915 --> 30:49.468
Elise, we could all use somemore time in this challenge.

30:49.571 --> 30:50.469
But we're not going to get it.

30:50.572 --> 30:52.022
Thyme herb.

30:52.126 --> 30:52.920
Thank you.

30:53.023 --> 30:54.438
Oh, you mean thyme, the herb.

30:54.542 --> 30:55.646
My bad.

30:55.750 --> 30:57.234
75 seconds.

30:57.338 --> 30:58.857
JENNIFER: Fudge.GORDON RAMSAY: Come on, guys.

30:58.960 --> 30:59.823
Holy shit

30:59.927 --> 31:01.549
Don't forget,
guys-- season, yeah?

31:01.652 --> 31:04.552
Make sure your protein'scooked well, vegetables cooked.

31:04.655 --> 31:06.761
Make it look beautiful.

31:06.865 --> 31:08.245
Guys, it's a mad
dash to the finish.

31:08.349 --> 31:09.660
MICHELLE: Come on, come
on, come on, Robyn.

31:09.764 --> 31:10.592
Come on.
-

31:10.696 --> 31:11.593
She needs to start
fucking plating.

31:11.697 --> 31:12.698
MICHELLE: She's
cutting it too thin.

31:12.801 --> 31:13.699
Oh, she's cutting it too thin!

31:13.802 --> 31:14.596
Oh, my god.

31:14.700 --> 31:15.632
This is stressful.

31:15.735 --> 31:16.875
Now I want to see
the other dishes.

31:16.978 --> 31:17.772
NICK: I know.

31:17.876 --> 31:19.153
ALL: Ah!

31:19.256 --> 31:20.568
BENJAMIN: It doesn't
make a difference who

31:20.671 --> 31:22.363
walks through the door,because I'm just going to beat

31:22.466 --> 31:23.709
them later in the competition.

31:23.812 --> 31:24.883
MICHELLE: Only one
of them is going

31:24.986 --> 31:26.608
to come through those doors.

31:26.712 --> 31:27.575
MILLY: Damn.

31:27.678 --> 31:30.992
GORDON RAMSAY: 3,
2, 1, and stop.

31:33.270 --> 31:34.099
Wow.

31:34.202 --> 31:35.928
That was intense.

31:36.032 --> 31:39.587
Ladies, only one spot left.

31:39.690 --> 31:42.383
Have you put everythingyou have into these dishes?

31:42.486 --> 31:43.280
ALL: Yes, Chef.

31:43.384 --> 31:44.316
GORDON RAMSAY: Glad to hear it.

31:44.419 --> 31:46.559
Let's start off with Robyn.

31:46.663 --> 31:48.251
ROBYN: I am shaking in my boots.

31:48.354 --> 31:50.701
And I'm trying not
to let it show.

31:50.805 --> 31:52.738
It's all down to this dish.

31:52.841 --> 31:54.084
GORDON RAMSAY: Describe
the dish, please.

31:54.188 --> 31:55.637
I have a seared lamb loin.

31:55.741 --> 31:58.917
I did a potato and corn hashwith some bacon in there.

31:59.020 --> 32:01.195
And finished a lamb loin with alittle bit of chimichurri sauce

32:01.298 --> 32:03.197
and some lemon zest.

32:03.300 --> 32:05.026
Visually, it looks refined.

32:05.130 --> 32:07.235
It's got that kind
of quirkiness to it.

32:07.339 --> 32:08.857
You know, you
change your protein.

32:08.961 --> 32:11.999
So you were setting
yourself up for failure.

32:12.102 --> 32:14.346
But you've actually nailedthe lamb beautifully,

32:14.449 --> 32:16.106
every slice from top to bottom.

32:16.210 --> 32:17.073
Thank you, Chef.

32:17.176 --> 32:19.075
Also, it's
melting in my mouth.

32:19.178 --> 32:21.318
The dish is finessed.

32:21.422 --> 32:23.803
It's exactly what I
would call a special.

32:23.907 --> 32:25.184
What I'd change?

32:25.288 --> 32:27.773
A bit more potato in there soyou got that starchy element

32:27.876 --> 32:29.464
and balance out the corn.

32:29.568 --> 32:31.673
But yeah, strong effort.

32:31.777 --> 32:32.605
Thank you, Chef.

32:32.709 --> 32:33.813
Thank you.

32:33.917 --> 32:34.814
Thank you!

32:34.918 --> 32:35.884
Thank you.

32:35.988 --> 32:37.956
ROBYN: I am so glad
I switched my dish.

32:38.059 --> 32:39.854
That was like the smartestthing you've done today, Robyn.

32:39.958 --> 32:41.994
Elise, let's go.

32:42.098 --> 32:43.030
ELISE: It's been a rough day.

32:43.133 --> 32:44.065
And I'm emotional.

32:44.169 --> 32:45.653
But that's because
I'm passionate.

32:45.756 --> 32:47.655
And I literally
could be going home.

32:47.758 --> 32:49.519
There's only one
black jacket left.

32:49.622 --> 32:52.625
So I'm humbly hoping thatmy dish is good enough.

32:52.729 --> 32:53.523
GORDON RAMSAY: Wow.

32:53.626 --> 32:54.903
Describe the dish, please.

32:55.007 --> 32:58.390
I made for you a pan-searedfilet mignon, potato pur e,

32:58.493 --> 32:59.667
and rainbow chard.

32:59.770 --> 33:01.634
And there's a mushroomduxelles underneath the steak.

33:01.738 --> 33:03.222
Mm.
Wow.

33:03.326 --> 33:04.672
Yeah, what have you
done to the potato?

33:04.775 --> 33:08.952
Pur ed it with a littlebit of cream, mascarpone.

33:09.056 --> 33:10.436
You put it in the blender?

33:10.540 --> 33:11.403
Yes, Chef.

33:11.506 --> 33:15.303
A great sear on the filet.

33:15.407 --> 33:16.442
Temperature inside?

33:16.546 --> 33:17.547
Medium rare, Chef.

33:17.650 --> 33:18.927
GORDON RAMSAY: Let's
have a look inside.

33:19.031 --> 33:19.825
Medium rare, right?

33:19.928 --> 33:20.722
ELISE: Yes, Chef.

33:26.314 --> 33:27.246
Wow.

33:27.350 --> 33:30.077
Filet is not medium rare.

33:30.180 --> 33:31.802
But it is tender.

33:31.906 --> 33:33.701
I love what you've done
with the seasoning.

33:33.804 --> 33:35.806
Mashed potatoes
taste a bit strange--

33:35.910 --> 33:37.567
duxelles, delicious.

33:37.670 --> 33:40.742
The greens, wonderful--
filet is tender.

33:40.846 --> 33:42.089
Please pick up your dish.ELISE: Yes, Chef.

33:42.192 --> 33:43.780
Thank you.Next up, Jennifer, please.

33:43.883 --> 33:46.231
Let's go.

33:46.334 --> 33:47.577
JENNIFER: When I go
home the first time,

33:47.680 --> 33:48.923
I was fucking blindsided.

33:49.027 --> 33:50.476
I was backstabbed.

33:50.580 --> 33:51.960
I feel like I was robbed.

33:52.064 --> 33:55.102
I promise, if you will
defend me to the end,

33:55.205 --> 33:57.725
I will have your back.

33:57.828 --> 33:59.451
The weakest chef--

33:59.554 --> 34:00.693
Will?

34:00.797 --> 34:02.868
I think Elise is astronger cook than Jennifer.

34:02.971 --> 34:06.665
Jennifer, please
give me your jacket.

34:06.768 --> 34:08.391
Keep your hand
head up, Jennifer.

34:08.494 --> 34:09.875
JENNIFER: [bleep].

34:09.978 --> 34:11.670
I've always said that
I wanted redemption.

34:11.773 --> 34:14.328
I want to fucking beat
Elise so bad right now.

34:14.431 --> 34:15.708
Jennifer, describe
the dish, please.

34:15.812 --> 34:17.572
Sea scallops and
shrimp with Old Bay

34:17.676 --> 34:19.471
butter and a corn succotash.

34:19.574 --> 34:20.920
GORDON RAMSAY: Visually,
it looks beautiful.

34:21.024 --> 34:21.818
It's glamorous.

34:21.921 --> 34:23.061
It's decadent.

34:23.164 --> 34:25.408
That's exactly thepersonality that I want to see

34:25.511 --> 34:26.961
with that attitude on a dish.

34:27.065 --> 34:28.031
Break down the succotash.

34:28.135 --> 34:29.170
What's in there?

34:29.274 --> 34:32.242
JENNIFER: Corn, peppers,
tomato, sweet potatoes--

34:32.346 --> 34:33.485
also there's a little
bacon in there.

34:33.588 --> 34:34.624
It gives its smokiness.

34:34.727 --> 34:36.004
GORDON RAMSAY:
Love the succotash.

34:36.108 --> 34:38.731
Shrimp-- cooked beautifully.

34:38.835 --> 34:41.320
Just the shrimp on its ownwith the succotash-- delicious.

34:41.424 --> 34:42.632
How long did you cook
the scallops for?

34:42.735 --> 34:43.909
I don't know, Chef.GORDON RAMSAY: You don't know?

34:44.012 --> 34:45.324
The time goes fast here, Chef.

34:45.428 --> 34:46.394
Mhm.

34:46.498 --> 34:48.327
You've got a great
sear on the outside,

34:48.431 --> 34:49.639
not so good underneath.

34:49.742 --> 34:52.607
The big question is, what'sit like in the center?

34:52.711 --> 34:53.505
Oh?

34:57.336 --> 35:00.408
Scallops slightly undercookedin the center there.

35:00.512 --> 35:04.102
I love what you've done withthe color on the outside.

35:04.205 --> 35:04.999
Succotash-- delicious.

35:05.103 --> 35:06.828
Shrimp-- delicious.

35:06.932 --> 35:07.933
Thank you.

35:08.036 --> 35:09.624
JENNIFER: If Elise
gets farther than me,

35:09.728 --> 35:10.729
she can fucking sit and spin.

35:10.832 --> 35:12.938
I am a way better
chef than she is.

35:13.041 --> 35:13.835
She's just a cook.

35:13.939 --> 35:15.078
And I'm a chef.

35:15.182 --> 35:18.116
GORDON RAMSAY: Elise,Robyn, Jennifer, all three

35:18.219 --> 35:21.291
of you put tremendous effortsacross all three challenges.

35:21.395 --> 35:23.604
And also, during your
time here as all stars,

35:23.707 --> 35:24.674
I'm grateful for that.

35:24.777 --> 35:25.640
You've done yourselves proud.

35:25.744 --> 35:27.090
Your family's proud.

35:27.194 --> 35:29.920
And unfortunately, the journeyends for one of you right now.

35:30.024 --> 35:34.925
I'm gonna narrow this downto two remaining chefs.

35:35.029 --> 35:37.652
ROBYN: I feel like I
deserve this so bad.

35:37.756 --> 35:40.172
I want that jacket!

35:40.276 --> 35:42.899
My decision is--

35:43.002 --> 35:44.625
Jennifer's scallops
is undercooked.

35:44.728 --> 35:47.731
And I think that
I'm a better leader.

35:47.835 --> 35:51.459
I just hope Chef Ramsayhasn't given up on me yet.

35:51.563 --> 35:52.771
I'm sorry.

35:52.874 --> 35:57.016
It's time for a nice girlto win, not a fucking devil.

35:57.120 --> 36:00.330
The person leaving"Hell's Kitchen" right now--

36:11.134 --> 36:16.001
Elise, Robin, Jennifer,
the person leaving

36:16.104 --> 36:17.520
"Hell's Kitchen" right now--

36:21.938 --> 36:22.732
Elise.

36:26.943 --> 36:28.255
Come here, young lady.

36:31.292 --> 36:33.501
First of all, I was sohappy to see you back here.

36:33.605 --> 36:34.916
Your passion is exemplary.

36:35.020 --> 36:36.573
Let's get that right.

36:36.677 --> 36:37.954
That dish fell short.

36:38.057 --> 36:40.232
But I don't want your jacket.

36:40.336 --> 36:42.061
I want you to walk out herewith your head up high.

36:42.165 --> 36:43.994
Thank you, Chef,
for having me back.

36:44.098 --> 36:45.099
GORDON RAMSAY: Thank you.

36:45.203 --> 36:47.998
Hey, don't you stop
on that journey.

36:48.102 --> 36:48.896
ELISE: Yes, Chef.

36:48.999 --> 36:49.793
GORDON RAMSAY: Good night.

36:54.246 --> 36:56.110
ELISE: I'm absolutely
better than those three

36:56.214 --> 36:57.318
dishes I put up today.

36:57.422 --> 36:59.113
And I'm definitelyembarrassed by my performance.

36:59.217 --> 37:00.735
Mentally, I was cooked.

37:00.839 --> 37:02.910
And I should have gotten
that black jacket.

37:03.013 --> 37:10.089
But I guess you could say thepressure got to me a bit today.

37:10.193 --> 37:12.920
Ladies, bring your dishesup here one more time, please.

37:13.023 --> 37:14.024
Yes, Chef.

37:14.128 --> 37:16.303
Motherfucking
redemption, bitch.

37:16.406 --> 37:17.683
Bye-bye, Elise.

37:17.787 --> 37:18.650
You went out first.

37:18.753 --> 37:19.547
Boom.

37:38.394 --> 37:40.465
Jennifer is an amazing cook.

37:40.568 --> 37:42.881
It just sucks that I haveto go against someone that I

37:42.984 --> 37:44.710
truly respect in this industry.

37:44.814 --> 37:47.299
This is so tough.

37:47.403 --> 37:48.266
My decision is--

37:54.858 --> 37:56.791
Christina, Jocky,
I need your help.

37:56.895 --> 37:57.930
Both of you, come
out here, please.

37:58.034 --> 37:58.828
Fuck.

37:58.931 --> 38:00.554
God.

38:00.657 --> 38:02.832
I'd like both of
you to taste this.

38:02.935 --> 38:04.143
Come over.

38:04.247 --> 38:05.662
[whispering]

38:06.939 --> 38:09.839
To the end, I got your
back no matter what--

38:09.942 --> 38:11.910
no matter what, you and me.

38:12.013 --> 38:13.532
I'm doing this for myself.

38:13.636 --> 38:15.154
But most of all, I'm
doing it for my mom.

38:19.538 --> 38:20.539
She's my rock.

38:20.643 --> 38:21.609
This is for you, Mom.

38:21.713 --> 38:23.439
I want to get this
black jacket for you.

38:28.306 --> 38:31.239
I always said if I
came back, I would win.

38:31.343 --> 38:33.966
So for me to go home
tonight, it would suck.

38:34.070 --> 38:36.452
And I would be so
upset with myself.

38:36.555 --> 38:37.522
But you know what?

38:37.625 --> 38:39.938
I went fucking out
swinging if I go home.

38:44.908 --> 38:47.152
Oh, boy.

38:47.255 --> 38:51.708
The final chef that'sreceiving a black jacket,

38:51.812 --> 38:55.471
congratulations goes to--

38:55.574 --> 38:56.403
Oh, fuck.

38:59.129 --> 38:59.923
Robyn!

39:05.066 --> 39:06.792
I love you-- so proud of you.

39:06.896 --> 39:09.277
Jennifer, that wasawfully close, young lady.

39:09.381 --> 39:13.558
You know, your
palate is incredible.

39:13.661 --> 39:15.594
And the change in you since thelast time in this competition

39:15.698 --> 39:17.320
is just mind-blowing.

39:17.424 --> 39:19.391
I hope you continue that
journey because there

39:19.495 --> 39:20.910
are some great things ahead.

39:21.013 --> 39:23.602
Chef, I'm so happy
that you asked me back.

39:23.706 --> 39:25.363
I'm so proud.

39:25.466 --> 39:26.640
You better fucking win this.

39:26.743 --> 39:28.538
For us now, girl.

39:28.642 --> 39:29.953
- Thank you, Chef.
- Oh, dear.

39:30.057 --> 39:30.851
Come here.

39:30.954 --> 39:32.542
Yeah, good luck.

39:32.646 --> 39:33.647
Thank you.

39:33.750 --> 39:35.096
Thank you, Jennifer.
Thanks for everything.

39:35.200 --> 39:36.443
JENNIFER: Thank you so
much for helping me out.

39:36.546 --> 39:37.340
Super proud.

39:37.444 --> 39:39.204
Thank you Well done.

39:39.307 --> 39:40.067
Jennifer.

39:44.002 --> 39:46.418
JENNIFER: I did
not expect myself

39:46.522 --> 39:48.178
to be going home right now.

39:48.282 --> 39:49.766
I wish I had done
a little bit more

39:49.870 --> 39:51.389
to make it to that black jacket.

39:51.492 --> 39:52.597
But you know what?

39:52.700 --> 39:54.081
I definitely think Robyndeserves the black jacket.

39:54.184 --> 39:55.669
She beat me out today
fair and square.

39:55.772 --> 39:56.601
And--

39:56.704 --> 39:58.741
[laughing]

39:58.844 --> 40:00.087
I still beat Elise.

40:00.190 --> 40:01.916
Who does this belong to?

40:02.020 --> 40:03.435
Congratulations.
Well done.

40:03.539 --> 40:04.402
Thanks, Chef.

40:04.505 --> 40:05.299
Good job.

40:05.403 --> 40:07.059
Black jacket, woo!

40:07.163 --> 40:08.233
Yes!

40:08.336 --> 40:10.442
I think I look pretty
pimp in a black jacket.

40:10.546 --> 40:12.340
Like, black looks great on me.

40:12.444 --> 40:14.204
GORDON RAMSAY: Well done.

40:14.308 --> 40:15.274
Deep breath-- enjoy it, right?

40:15.378 --> 40:16.862
Good job.

40:16.966 --> 40:20.659
Told you I was going
to bring this, Mom.

40:20.763 --> 40:23.110
Shit.

40:23.213 --> 40:24.732
As long as it's
not Elise, I'm happy.

40:24.836 --> 40:25.940
[laughing]

40:26.976 --> 40:28.253
[knocking]
- Who is it?

40:28.356 --> 40:29.288
Who is it?
Who is it?

40:29.392 --> 40:30.635
- All right, I'll go.
- Open the door!

40:30.738 --> 40:31.532
Who is it?

40:31.636 --> 40:32.637
MILLY: Who is it?

40:32.740 --> 40:33.500
Yes, Robyn!

40:36.503 --> 40:38.125
MICHELLE: Robyn!MILLY: That's right, mamacita.

40:38.228 --> 40:39.575
-
NARRATOR: Blue team!

40:39.678 --> 40:42.474
[laughing]

40:43.475 --> 40:44.269
I knew it!

40:44.372 --> 40:45.753
I knew it, baby!

40:45.857 --> 40:46.685
Yay!

40:46.789 --> 40:47.928
Elise is gone.

40:48.031 --> 40:49.999
There's nothing more I couldask for in this moment.

40:50.102 --> 40:51.483
[knocking]

40:51.587 --> 40:52.484
Who is it?

40:52.588 --> 40:55.487
[cheering]

40:56.523 --> 40:57.593
GORDON RAMSAY: Congratulations.

41:01.666 --> 41:04.496
First of all, you should allbe feeling incredibly proud.

41:04.600 --> 41:05.808
That was intense.
- Yeah.

41:05.911 --> 41:06.740
It's intense.

41:06.843 --> 41:07.741
The reason?

41:07.844 --> 41:10.191
Because you've all
become that good.

41:10.295 --> 41:14.713
Now it's going to
get even tougher.

41:14.817 --> 41:16.715
It's been much more
challenging this time.

41:16.819 --> 41:17.854
The competition's tougher.

41:17.958 --> 41:18.959
The challenges are tougher.

41:19.062 --> 41:20.201
The service is tougher.

41:20.305 --> 41:22.031
To be able to get to theblacks is really important.

41:22.134 --> 41:23.204
This is when it
starts to get real.

41:23.308 --> 41:24.447
And you know, I think
it's going to be

41:24.551 --> 41:26.069
a mad dash to the finish line.

41:26.173 --> 41:31.212
1, 2, 3, 4, 5 talented
individuals with a 1

41:31.316 --> 41:34.353
in 5 chance of
getting yourselves

41:34.457 --> 41:36.114
that incredible position.

41:36.217 --> 41:38.012
MICHELLE: It does feelreally surreal right now.

41:38.116 --> 41:40.739
It's every woman or
every man for themselves

41:40.843 --> 41:43.224
because we all need to showChef Ramsay our talent.

41:43.328 --> 41:45.572
And it's going to be a reallycutthroat competition from here

41:45.675 --> 41:46.469
on out.

41:46.573 --> 41:48.298
There's not long to go.

41:48.402 --> 41:51.198
But it's still a very
tough road ahead.

41:51.301 --> 41:52.095
Yes, Chef.

41:52.199 --> 41:53.200
I'm number one.

41:53.303 --> 41:54.546
I've got it.

41:54.650 --> 41:57.066
And now I just got to ridethis number one fucking car

41:57.169 --> 41:58.136
all the way to the finish line.

41:58.239 --> 42:00.310
I just got to keep
it in front and win.

42:00.414 --> 42:01.484
Black jacket, well done.

42:01.588 --> 42:02.381
Congratulations.
