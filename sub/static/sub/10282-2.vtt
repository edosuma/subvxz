00:32.900 --> 00:34.235
Previously, on E.R...

00:34.268 --> 00:36.070
I don't know what else to do.

00:36.104 --> 00:39.207
Go to your car
and follow me back to Chicago.

00:39.240 --> 00:41.509
Welcome to County,
Dr. Lockhart.

00:41.542 --> 00:43.511
Eight years of school, you're
so close to the finish line.

00:43.544 --> 00:46.247
What are you gonna do,
just throw away your future?

00:46.280 --> 00:47.715
I'm not sure if it's
the future I want.

00:47.748 --> 00:49.683
WEAVER:
You don't work here
anymore.

00:49.717 --> 00:51.285
When are you coming back?

00:51.319 --> 00:53.187
I'm not sure.

00:53.221 --> 00:55.256
I've got to rest...

00:55.289 --> 00:57.191
get back into work.

01:07.668 --> 01:09.403
KEM:
John!

01:11.572 --> 01:12.640
Kem?!

01:14.142 --> 01:14.875
( Kem screams )

01:14.908 --> 01:16.277
Kem?!

01:16.310 --> 01:18.379
( Kem screaming )

01:31.559 --> 01:33.594
( soft clattering )

01:36.930 --> 01:38.399
( sighs )

01:55.616 --> 01:57.485
Can't sleep?

01:59.320 --> 02:02.890
You'll get cold
like that.

02:02.923 --> 02:04.758
He'll come back.

02:04.792 --> 02:08.262
We won't have any idea when.

02:08.295 --> 02:09.562
We'll be sleeping in
one morning,

02:09.597 --> 02:10.931
or on our way home
from a movie,

02:10.964 --> 02:12.366
and he'll just show up.

02:12.400 --> 02:15.203
Well, we'll deal
with that.

02:15.236 --> 02:16.704
I don't know why you'd want to.

02:16.737 --> 02:18.572
KOVAC:
I can think of a reason.

02:22.376 --> 02:25.213
This place is too small.

02:25.246 --> 02:27.415
Maybe you should both
come live with me.

02:27.448 --> 02:28.582
What?

02:28.616 --> 02:30.651
My apartment has two floors.

02:30.684 --> 02:32.486
Alex can sleep downstairs.

02:32.520 --> 02:33.921
Luka...

02:33.954 --> 02:35.623
if we all move in together,
it's gonna be

02:35.656 --> 02:37.225
because it's something
we all want,

02:37.225 --> 02:38.759
not because you think
we need to be protected.

02:38.792 --> 02:40.628
Hey...
I need to take
a shower.

02:40.661 --> 02:41.595
Hey.

02:44.432 --> 02:46.400
Scrambled or fried?

02:49.537 --> 02:50.471
Poached.

02:52.640 --> 02:53.874
Poached.

02:55.809 --> 02:58.379
( phone ringing )

03:09.823 --> 03:12.260
( clears throat ):
Hello?

03:12.260 --> 03:13.794
( woman speaks Punjabi )
What? Hello?

03:13.827 --> 03:15.296
This is Neela's mother.

03:15.329 --> 03:16.997
We are on our way in
from the airport.

03:17.030 --> 03:18.366
Hold on a second.

03:22.603 --> 03:23.871
( gasps )

03:23.904 --> 03:25.573
It's for you.

03:27.040 --> 03:28.842
Hello, Neela?

04:32.640 --> 04:33.841
You didn't tell your parents?

04:33.874 --> 04:35.509
I was waiting
for the right time.

04:35.543 --> 04:37.611
When?
My wedding day.

04:37.645 --> 04:40.514
Hey, you know, you could
just put those... anywhere.

04:40.548 --> 04:42.015
They phoned Michigan.

04:42.049 --> 04:44.685
The department head
told them I wasn't there.

04:44.718 --> 04:45.686
Those are still dirty.

04:45.719 --> 04:47.388
I'm totally screwed.

04:47.421 --> 04:48.489
What are you doing?

04:48.522 --> 04:49.690
I'm getting out
of your way.

04:49.723 --> 04:51.359
No, please don't leave me.

04:51.359 --> 04:52.860
Oh, Neela, they're
just your parents.

04:52.893 --> 04:54.395
You think you've seen trauma
at work?

04:54.428 --> 04:55.829
You don't know the Rasgotras.

04:55.863 --> 04:57.731
I know this may not be
the best time to ask,

04:57.765 --> 05:00.401
but how long do you think
you'll be needing my couch?

05:00.434 --> 05:02.436
( knocking )

05:02.470 --> 05:03.971
( quietly ):
Damn it.

05:08.809 --> 05:10.944
Mom, Dad.

05:10.978 --> 05:12.480
You remember Abby.

05:18.586 --> 05:20.388
You look like hell.

05:20.421 --> 05:22.590
Yeah, The Searchers was on
channel nine last night.

05:22.623 --> 05:25.459
It's tough to sleep
in the middle of
a John Ford movie.

05:25.493 --> 05:27.428
Talked to Jing Mei?
Yeah, she's in a cast.

05:27.461 --> 05:29.062
She's gonna start seeing
a physical therapist.

05:29.096 --> 05:30.698
Pratt keeps calling.

05:30.731 --> 05:32.566
Wants Weaver to put him
back on the schedule.

05:32.600 --> 05:34.402
The guy doesn't even have
his stitches out yet.

05:34.435 --> 05:36.804
Kyle Skinner, 23 years old,
was found altered by his mom.

05:36.837 --> 05:38.038
He's had some
skin grafts.

05:38.071 --> 05:39.473
His headache's
getting worse.

05:39.507 --> 05:41.409
Looks like dehiscence
with cellulitis.

05:41.409 --> 05:42.510
What happened to him?

05:42.543 --> 05:43.777
Iraq. He was
a hemmit driver

05:43.811 --> 05:45.479
in the Sunni triangle
near Fallouja.

05:46.980 --> 05:48.949
Any meds? Allergies?
Just Vicodin
when he hurts.

05:48.982 --> 05:50.651
CARTER:
Lungs are clear.

05:50.684 --> 05:52.786
What's the differential
for altered mental status

05:52.820 --> 05:54.422
with fever and headache?

05:54.455 --> 05:55.856
Well, this guy's a setup
for all kinds of stuff,

05:55.889 --> 05:57.825
but I'd have to go with
meningitis all the way.

05:57.858 --> 05:59.092
( groans softly )

05:59.126 --> 06:00.494
Uh, Dr. Carter?

06:00.528 --> 06:02.930
SKINNER:
Take me home, Ma.

06:04.865 --> 06:07.034
All right, CBC, uh...

06:07.067 --> 06:10.438
blood and wound cultures,
LP, ceftriaxone, and a head CT.

06:11.872 --> 06:14.442
Easy, man, we're gonna
fix you right up, okay?

06:14.442 --> 06:15.976
( coughing ):
No, you won't.

06:19.813 --> 06:21.048
Dislocated shoulder
in three, Harold.

06:21.081 --> 06:22.716
Herman.
Howard.

06:22.750 --> 06:25.052
Ha! There is a god.

06:25.085 --> 06:27.688
It took me five minutes just
to track down a strep culture.

06:27.721 --> 06:29.623
What are you waiting for on
this ankle sprain in two?

06:29.657 --> 06:31.459
Needs an ace wrap
and a crutch lesson.

06:31.492 --> 06:32.960
I'll do it as soon as I swab
my football player's throat.

06:32.993 --> 06:34.662
Abby, how many patients
do you have on the board?

06:34.695 --> 06:37.030
Ten?
12. You can't be an
efficient resident

06:37.064 --> 06:39.032
if you get hung up
doing jobs other
people can do.

06:39.066 --> 06:40.734
Yes, well, sometimes
it's easier...

06:40.768 --> 06:42.703
Your job is to move patients,
not wrap bad ankles

06:42.736 --> 06:44.605
or go on treasure hunts
for strep cultures.

06:44.638 --> 06:47.007
You need to learn to delegate
to nurses and med students.

06:47.040 --> 06:49.810
Go see the migraine in one.

06:49.843 --> 06:52.646
Abby... your med student
ordered a bolus

06:52.680 --> 06:54.648
on the dehydrated kid.
My med student?

06:54.682 --> 06:56.183
Penny Nicholson.

06:56.216 --> 06:58.018
Dr. Weaver told me
I'd be shadowing you today.

06:58.051 --> 07:00.120
I need you
to cosign the order.

07:00.153 --> 07:03.156
Weird. Last week someone
was cosigning for me.

07:03.190 --> 07:04.758
Nice to be the boss, huh?

07:04.792 --> 07:06.494
Sam, can you prep and drape
my forehead lac in two?

07:06.527 --> 07:08.829
Yeah, I'm on my way.
And can you do
a throat swab

07:08.862 --> 07:10.063
for the guy in sutures?

07:10.097 --> 07:11.865
Fine!

07:11.899 --> 07:14.735
Something the matter?
I'm getting slammed here.

07:14.768 --> 07:16.537
In the time it took you
to wait and ask me to do it,

07:16.570 --> 07:18.138
you could have
swabbed him yourself.

07:18.171 --> 07:19.973
Oh, but you can do a setup
for Dr. Tiger Beat over there?

07:20.007 --> 07:23.577
That's my patient.
It's okay, Sam,
I'll do it.

07:23.611 --> 07:25.078
Thanks, Haleh.
No problem.

07:25.112 --> 07:27.748
Listen, Haleh, I, uh,
I think you might have been off

07:27.781 --> 07:30.183
a decimal point
on my pylo patient's dopamine.

07:30.217 --> 07:32.553
Excuse me?

07:32.586 --> 07:35.656
I just noticed it was running
at three cc's instead of 30.

07:35.689 --> 07:36.724
I caught it early,
but next time,

07:36.757 --> 07:38.926
maybe you could double-check.

07:38.959 --> 07:40.828
You need to double-check
the concentration

07:40.861 --> 07:42.930
before you start messing
with the I.V. pump.

07:42.963 --> 07:45.165
I mixed it ten to one.

07:45.198 --> 07:47.267
Don't we always mix it
one to one?

07:47.300 --> 07:49.570
No, you always mix
it one to one.

07:49.603 --> 07:52.072
I always mix it
ten to one.
I didn't realize...

07:52.105 --> 07:54.675
If you concentrate the drip,
the bag will last longer.

07:54.708 --> 07:56.544
Sorry.
I'll go turn
down her rate,

07:56.577 --> 07:59.212
make sure her B.P.
doesn't hit the roof.

08:01.682 --> 08:06.554
Um... you know, nurses
really are the backbone
of a place like this.

08:06.554 --> 08:09.557
It's good to get
on their good side.

08:09.557 --> 08:12.693
Thanks. I'll keep
that in mind.

08:27.708 --> 08:30.210
So, when are you going
to tell us what's going on?

08:30.243 --> 08:31.879
Ajay, relax.

08:44.892 --> 08:48.596
I don't know if I want
to be a doctor.

08:48.596 --> 08:50.130
What?

08:50.163 --> 08:51.832
I'm not sure
I'm good at it.

08:51.865 --> 08:53.233
Of course you're
good at it.

08:53.266 --> 08:55.102
You're good
at everything.

08:55.135 --> 08:57.104
Some people
send their children
to medical school,

08:57.137 --> 08:58.872
they get a Nobel Prize
on the mantle.

08:58.906 --> 09:00.741
Ajay, please!
Why does she want
to punish us?

09:00.774 --> 09:02.109
I'm not trying
to punish you.

09:02.142 --> 09:03.877
I'm just trying
to figure some things out.

09:03.911 --> 09:04.812
What's there to figure out?

09:04.845 --> 09:05.779
Like what I want to do,

09:05.813 --> 09:06.947
how I want my life to be.

09:06.980 --> 09:08.148
Neela, you're not
a child anymore!

09:08.181 --> 09:11.619
Then stop treating
me like one.

09:11.652 --> 09:13.954
And what about
your brothers and sisters?

09:13.987 --> 09:15.956
Don't you think they want
to go to university, too?

09:15.989 --> 09:18.091
We don't make enough
at the restaurant
to pay for all that.

09:18.125 --> 09:19.627
And, Neela,
you promised to help out

09:19.627 --> 09:20.628
once you began
your residency.

09:20.661 --> 09:21.929
I'll help soon enough.

09:21.962 --> 09:23.330
You'll just have
to wait a little.

09:23.363 --> 09:24.965
Is that what you're going
to tell them?

09:24.998 --> 09:26.767
That their futures
have to wait

09:26.800 --> 09:29.269
because their sister is not sure
what she wants her life to be?!

09:29.302 --> 09:31.739
I'll have a job soon,
and I'll send some money.

09:31.772 --> 09:33.073
What job? Where?

09:33.106 --> 09:34.775
Here at the hospital, I hope.

09:34.808 --> 09:35.943
That's possible?

09:35.976 --> 09:37.144
I've talked to my supervisor,

09:37.177 --> 09:38.311
she's trying to arrange it.

09:38.345 --> 09:39.880
Starting when?

09:39.913 --> 09:44.051
I'm supposed to discuss it
with her today!

09:44.084 --> 09:45.352
If the third neb
doesn't break her,

09:45.385 --> 09:47.054
it's time to
call her up.
Call her up?

09:47.087 --> 09:48.756
To medicine,
to be admitted.

09:48.789 --> 09:50.323
Call the resident.
Should I write this down?

09:50.357 --> 09:52.292
What year did
you say you were?

09:52.325 --> 09:54.361
Labs are back on
your Crohn's guy,
Dr. Lockhart.

09:54.394 --> 09:56.163
Something wrong?
Yeah, I heard
what you did.

09:56.196 --> 09:58.065
HOWARD:
Um, excuse me?

09:58.098 --> 10:00.133
Changed the bedpan
in two and dug out
the earwax in one.

10:00.167 --> 10:01.635
Et tu Chuny?

10:01.669 --> 10:03.403
Acetaminophen level
on pharmacy girl.

10:03.436 --> 10:05.338
Okay, what, so now
I'm the bane of all nurses?

10:05.372 --> 10:07.941
Anything else?
Yeah, you can stop
the mucomyst.

10:07.975 --> 10:08.976
Yes, Doctor.
Abby?

10:09.009 --> 10:10.210
What?!

10:10.243 --> 10:12.680
Anterior glenohumeral
dislocation.

10:12.713 --> 10:14.782
I was hoping you
could take a look.
Did you try to reduce it?

10:14.815 --> 10:16.083
The girl won't let
me tape the weight

10:16.116 --> 10:18.151
to her hand--
she's crying a lot.

10:18.185 --> 10:20.921
Hi. I'm Dr. Lockhart.

10:20.954 --> 10:22.956
Are you the mom?
I'm her aunt.

10:22.990 --> 10:24.091
She cannot move it.

10:24.124 --> 10:25.158
I tried to fix
at home but...

10:25.192 --> 10:26.660
Okay. What's her name?

10:26.694 --> 10:28.061
Marta.

10:28.095 --> 10:30.931
Marta, I'm gonna show you
a trick with a sheet,

10:30.964 --> 10:33.233
and it's gonna make your arm
feel much better, okay?

10:33.266 --> 10:34.835
She doesn't speak
much English.

10:34.868 --> 10:36.670
Um... okay.

10:36.704 --> 10:39.239
Quiero ayudarte.

10:39.272 --> 10:40.240
Huh?

10:40.273 --> 10:41.408
Three of versed and 50 of fent.

10:41.441 --> 10:43.110
You sure you want
to use both?

10:43.143 --> 10:45.278
Yes, I am.
Can you hook up some blow-by.
Blow-by?

10:45.312 --> 10:46.947
I'll get it.

10:46.980 --> 10:48.415
You don't think the
versed will be enough?

10:48.448 --> 10:50.383
No, I think
it'll be too painful.

10:50.417 --> 10:52.085
Marta, es sola una...

10:52.119 --> 10:53.754
uh... uh...

10:53.787 --> 10:56.189
sheet, okay?

10:56.223 --> 10:58.458
No dolor nada.
Here you go.

10:58.491 --> 11:00.027
Versed's in.

11:00.060 --> 11:01.361
ABBY:
Penny, come here.

11:01.394 --> 11:02.930
Um, I'm not
really familiar

11:02.963 --> 11:04.397
with this
technique.
It's okay.

11:04.431 --> 11:07.267
All right, go ahead
with the fent.

11:07.300 --> 11:08.969
O2's not ready.

11:09.002 --> 11:12.005
50 of fent sounds like a lot
on top of the versed.

11:12.039 --> 11:13.874
That's what
I was saying.

11:13.907 --> 11:16.877
Listen, team, we're shoving
a bone back into its socket.

11:16.910 --> 11:18.278
If it were you,

11:18.311 --> 11:19.813
you'd want all the pain meds
in the hospital.

11:19.847 --> 11:21.281
It could suppress her
respiratory drive.

11:21.314 --> 11:23.016
I'm aware of that, Howard.

11:23.050 --> 11:24.484
That's why I asked for oxygen.

11:24.517 --> 11:27.154
Okay... on the count of three,

11:27.187 --> 11:28.255
I want you to lean back

11:28.288 --> 11:29.790
as hard as you can.

11:29.823 --> 11:31.324
All right, this
is gonna go fast.

11:31.358 --> 11:32.960
Muy rapido.

11:32.993 --> 11:34.161
Okay, one,

11:34.194 --> 11:36.129
two... three.

11:36.163 --> 11:37.164
( crying gasp )

11:37.197 --> 11:38.231
Cool.

11:38.265 --> 11:39.800
We can go now?

11:39.833 --> 11:44.772
Um... there's a cut here, too.

11:44.772 --> 11:45.873
We should clean that out.

11:45.906 --> 11:47.474
SAM:
Ceftriaxone's in.

11:47.507 --> 11:49.276
CARTER:
CT shows a sinus
infection

11:49.309 --> 11:51.178
that's spread
to his brain.

11:51.211 --> 11:53.113
We can isolate it
with a tap down here,

11:53.146 --> 11:55.348
but he's going to have to go
up to the O.R. for drainage.

11:55.382 --> 11:57.084
Hold still, Kyle,
little pinch.

11:57.117 --> 11:58.351
When was he wounded?

11:58.385 --> 11:59.519
HARRIET:
In February.

11:59.552 --> 12:01.488
Okay, one more minute.

12:01.521 --> 12:03.056
I've been with him
the whole way.

12:03.090 --> 12:04.992
Finally got him home
on Tuesday, and now this.

12:06.927 --> 12:08.028
( clears throat )

12:12.265 --> 12:14.868
Yeah, fluid's cloudy.

12:14.902 --> 12:16.203
That means
an infection, right?

12:16.236 --> 12:17.971
Almost done.
You okay, Kyle?

12:18.005 --> 12:18.972
Yeah.

12:19.006 --> 12:21.942
Okay, we are done.

12:21.975 --> 12:23.443
You want me to run those
to the lab?

12:23.476 --> 12:25.112
Yeah, but I want you
to stay with them

12:25.145 --> 12:26.279
while they do the gram stain.

12:26.313 --> 12:28.048
They like to lose things
up there.

12:28.081 --> 12:32.285
Okay, you can
sit up now.

12:32.319 --> 12:34.521
Why don't you try
and get some sleep,

12:34.554 --> 12:36.423
and I will be back
in a little bit.

12:36.456 --> 12:37.490
Can't sleep.

12:37.524 --> 12:38.959
Well, I will see
what I can do

12:38.992 --> 12:40.360
about moving you
into a quiet room.

12:40.393 --> 12:41.494
Doesn't matter.

12:41.528 --> 12:42.830
Try and get
some rest, huh?

12:42.863 --> 12:44.164
In my dreams,

12:44.197 --> 12:47.267
I'm still the guy
I used to be...

12:47.300 --> 12:48.836
but I always wake up.

12:51.238 --> 12:52.239
LOCKHART:
Did you get a history?

12:52.272 --> 12:53.506
HOWARD:
No hablo,

12:53.540 --> 12:55.308
and they didn't have
any paperwork, so...

12:55.342 --> 12:57.477
And no address
and no phone number.

12:57.510 --> 12:59.312
Okay.

12:59.346 --> 13:00.881
ROSARIO:
She better now. We go.

13:00.914 --> 13:02.215
Get a guard
over here, okay?

13:03.550 --> 13:04.417
Hi.

13:04.451 --> 13:06.386
Feels good. Gracias.

13:06.419 --> 13:08.488
Okay, but, uh, I'm
going to give you
a complete exam.

13:08.521 --> 13:09.456
What for?

13:16.997 --> 13:18.999
¿Hermanos?

13:19.032 --> 13:20.167
Sisters.

13:20.200 --> 13:21.201
Three.

13:23.236 --> 13:24.604
See there?

13:24.637 --> 13:26.006
¿Que pasó?

13:26.039 --> 13:28.041
The-the girls play
crazy sometimes.

13:37.550 --> 13:39.052
Okay.

13:39.086 --> 13:41.454
Los pantalones, can
you take them off?

13:41.488 --> 13:42.956
Why you look at her legs?

13:42.990 --> 13:44.424
Because everybody
gets a full exam.

13:44.457 --> 13:46.259
We don't have time.
Marta, vamonos.

13:46.293 --> 13:49.296
Well, you can't leave.
Ma'am, you can't leave.

13:49.329 --> 13:51.364
Ma'am, you don't want
to do that. Stop them!

13:51.398 --> 13:52.966
Dejanos!
Calm down, ma'am.

13:53.000 --> 13:54.134
What are you doing!
Calm down!

13:54.167 --> 13:55.402
Dejanos!
Calm down!

13:55.435 --> 13:57.304
Get away from me.
No me toques!

13:57.337 --> 13:58.571
Take her
to the conference room.

13:58.605 --> 14:00.273
No me toques!
I'll get the girl.

14:00.307 --> 14:02.042
Marta! Marta!

14:02.075 --> 14:04.311
Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait. Okay.

14:04.344 --> 14:06.379
No quiero que me toques!
Slut. Puta.

14:06.413 --> 14:07.981
Okay, listen,
listen...

14:08.015 --> 14:09.950
Uh, tranquila,
tranquila, okay?

14:09.983 --> 14:11.518
I'm not going
to hurt you.

14:11.551 --> 14:14.054
I'm not going to hurt you.

14:14.087 --> 14:15.222
( sobs )

14:15.255 --> 14:16.189
Okay?

14:17.690 --> 14:18.625
Okay.

14:29.502 --> 14:31.371
I wasn't aware there was
a dress code here.

14:31.404 --> 14:33.440
I just don't want you
to create

14:33.473 --> 14:36.309
any discomfort
for the patients.

14:36.343 --> 14:40.080
The patients or
the other doctors?

14:40.113 --> 14:41.281
It's the jewelry,
isn't it?

14:41.314 --> 14:42.615
No...

14:42.649 --> 14:45.285
Hmm, the fingernails?
Tattoo? The hair?

14:45.318 --> 14:47.420
It's the whole package.

14:47.454 --> 14:49.456
Okay, well, I'll
talk to my band mates

14:49.489 --> 14:52.392
and see if I can't
pull it back a little.

14:52.425 --> 14:53.660
Band mates?

14:53.693 --> 14:54.962
It appears we've hired

14:54.962 --> 14:58.098
the love child
of Ozzy Osbourne.

14:58.131 --> 14:59.299
So, did Kem get back okay?

14:59.332 --> 15:00.300
Yep.

15:00.333 --> 15:01.568
Have you heard
from her yet?

15:01.601 --> 15:02.535
Yep, she sent
me an e-mail.

15:02.569 --> 15:04.437
Dr. Weaver?

15:04.471 --> 15:06.039
She and I are just
sort of taking a
little time to...

15:06.073 --> 15:07.074
How's Henry?

15:07.107 --> 15:08.641
He's pretty great, thanks.

15:08.675 --> 15:10.377
JERRY:
So, your folks are
back in Chicago?

15:10.410 --> 15:11.711
That's great,
but where are they?

15:11.744 --> 15:12.980
They're across the street.

15:12.980 --> 15:14.014
Is Dr. Weaver in?

15:14.047 --> 15:15.148
CARTER:
Yes, she is.

15:15.182 --> 15:16.683
She's just
down the hall there.

15:16.716 --> 15:18.651
Hi, Dr. Carter.
How is everything?

15:18.685 --> 15:23.023
Um... nice to see
you, Neela.

15:23.056 --> 15:24.191
Wait, what's
she doing here?

15:24.224 --> 15:25.325
I'm not really sure.

15:25.358 --> 15:27.294
I am not an animal!

15:27.327 --> 15:28.528
Whose patient is that?

15:28.561 --> 15:30.097
I did the H and P,
was waiting on a doctor.

15:30.130 --> 15:31.631
I am not a victim!
Okay, ma'am?

15:31.664 --> 15:33.733
You need to settle down!
( shouts )

15:33.766 --> 15:36.003
I am the solution...
Hard restraints.

15:36.036 --> 15:36.636
to the problem...

15:36.669 --> 15:37.604
( screams )

15:37.637 --> 15:40.307
I am not the problem!

15:40.340 --> 15:42.375
Actually, right now,
you are.

15:42.409 --> 15:44.011
He forgot to
write it down.

15:44.044 --> 15:45.478
He's lying. He wouldn't
even let me take it.

15:45.512 --> 15:46.479
You're a liar!

15:46.513 --> 15:47.480
You're a liar!

15:47.514 --> 15:48.548
You are!

15:48.581 --> 15:50.050
Dr. Weaver, do
you have a minute?

15:50.083 --> 15:52.352
Malik, try to take his
temperature again, okay?

15:52.385 --> 15:54.454
I've decided not to do my
internship at Ann Arbor.

15:54.487 --> 15:56.423
I know. Your department
head called me.

15:56.456 --> 15:58.025
He wanted to know
if we detected

15:58.058 --> 16:00.327
any psychiatric problems
during your rotation.

16:00.360 --> 16:02.062
What did you tell him?

16:02.095 --> 16:03.696
I lied.

16:03.730 --> 16:05.165
I didn't want to be there.

16:05.198 --> 16:07.367
I'm not even sure I
want to be a doctor.

16:07.400 --> 16:09.402
So... what can I do for you?

16:09.436 --> 16:11.404
Give me a position.

16:11.438 --> 16:14.674
A job-- any kind of
job-- just until I
get myself refocused.

16:14.707 --> 16:16.176
But you don't want
to be a doctor?

16:16.209 --> 16:17.210
No, what I meant...

16:17.244 --> 16:19.046
I have no idea what I meant.

16:19.079 --> 16:20.613
I just... I
need some work.

16:20.647 --> 16:23.350
Uh... I'm sorry.
I can't-can't really help you.

16:23.383 --> 16:24.784
Look, I'll take
anything.

16:24.817 --> 16:27.354
I-I can stock supplies
or be a candy striper...

16:27.387 --> 16:29.156
Neela, can I give
you some advice?

16:29.189 --> 16:31.258
Go back to Michigan,
before it's too late.

16:34.294 --> 16:36.396
¿Esta bien?
Does that hurt?

16:36.429 --> 16:38.665
Donde esta Mamacita?

16:38.698 --> 16:40.533
Quiero Mamacita.

16:40.567 --> 16:42.302
Well...

16:42.335 --> 16:44.771
your aunt has to
answer some questions.

16:50.077 --> 16:53.146
Why do you call
her "mamacita"?

16:53.180 --> 16:55.582
Is she your mother?

16:58.485 --> 17:00.320
You said she was
your aunt, right?

17:00.353 --> 17:02.589
No es.

17:04.491 --> 17:06.326
What?

17:06.358 --> 17:09.229
No es mi tia.

17:09.262 --> 17:13.099
She... she keeps us.

17:13.133 --> 17:16.203
She keeps who?
You and your sisters?

17:16.236 --> 17:17.804
Not sisters.

17:17.837 --> 17:19.205
Only girls.

17:23.276 --> 17:26.179
Is Mamacita the one
that's been hurting you?

17:28.781 --> 17:29.716
You can tell me.

17:29.749 --> 17:32.119
No mas. Secreto.

17:33.386 --> 17:36.323
Okay.

17:36.356 --> 17:38.158
It's okay. You're safe here.

17:38.191 --> 17:39.259
Who's hurting you?

17:41.761 --> 17:43.830
Marta, who hurts you?

17:48.835 --> 17:50.237
Los hombres.

17:52.139 --> 17:54.374
Military medical record
on Kyle Skinner.

17:54.407 --> 17:56.343
His mom had someone
drop them off.

17:56.376 --> 17:57.777
Okay, thanks.

18:11.891 --> 18:14.361
Coffee break?

18:14.394 --> 18:18.465
Nah, I put vodka in
here on special days.

18:18.498 --> 18:21.268
( sighs )

18:25.338 --> 18:28.275
I wasn't trying to be
a hero this morning.

18:34.447 --> 18:37.784
I asked you to move
in, because I...

18:37.817 --> 18:39.286
I love you.

18:42.722 --> 18:45.458
I'm in love with you, and I..

18:45.492 --> 18:49.396
I thought, I don't know,
maybe... you feel the same.

18:51.498 --> 18:54.867
( sighs ):
Did you just say that?

18:54.901 --> 18:58.271
I've spent too much
time wasting time.

18:58.305 --> 19:02.309
So, whenever you're ready,
just let me know.

19:08.748 --> 19:10.217
You guys doctors?

19:10.217 --> 19:11.451
My buddy needs
some help.

19:11.484 --> 19:12.819
Herm Bullard.

19:12.852 --> 19:14.854
I'm a marine biologist
over at the aquarium.

19:14.887 --> 19:16.656
Hey, over here!
There's been
a small incident

19:16.689 --> 19:18.825
during a tank cleaning.
What the hell
is that?

19:18.858 --> 19:19.959
HERM:
Ginglymostoma
cirratum--

19:19.992 --> 19:21.561
a nurse shark.

19:21.594 --> 19:23.330
Damn fish just latched onto me.

19:23.363 --> 19:25.365
We need to get
them disconnected.
Gee, you think?

19:25.398 --> 19:27.700
But it's important that neither
Mr. Fahey nor the shark

19:27.734 --> 19:28.835
be damaged
in any way.

19:28.868 --> 19:29.802
I'll get a gurney.

19:29.836 --> 19:30.870
Uh, wheelchair, too.

19:30.903 --> 19:32.239
Keep pouring water
on him, Mort.

19:32.272 --> 19:34.574
He's suffocating.

19:34.607 --> 19:36.509
Chuny, I have a
patient in Sutures.

19:36.543 --> 19:37.944
I need you to help
me get a history.

19:37.977 --> 19:40.247
Last time I checked,
an H and P was a doctor's job.

19:40.280 --> 19:42.582
Yeah, she's in trouble, and
my Spanish is not very good.

19:42.615 --> 19:44.517
The one who came in
with her aunt?
It's not her aunt.

19:44.551 --> 19:46.286
Chuny, can you change
the pressure dressing

19:46.319 --> 19:48.555
on my pumper in one?
Security has her in
custody right now.

19:48.588 --> 19:50.390
I'll be over there
in a minute.
Thank you.

19:50.423 --> 19:51.924
He'll only live
for 30 minutes

19:51.958 --> 19:52.992
or so like this.
What?!

19:53.025 --> 19:54.427
Not you, Mort, the shark.

19:54.461 --> 19:55.728
You're just making it worse.

19:55.762 --> 19:57.530
KOVAC:
Need three grams
of Unasyn I.V.

19:57.564 --> 19:58.898
SAM:
Can you feel this?
Yeah.

19:58.931 --> 19:59.932
Clem, go get
the tank from
the truck.

19:59.966 --> 20:01.334
This?
Yes.

20:01.368 --> 20:02.735
Fish got a mouthful
of subq fat.

20:02.769 --> 20:05.905
SAM:
Can you feel this?

20:05.938 --> 20:07.340
Hey, watch it!

20:07.374 --> 20:08.308
( moaning )

20:08.341 --> 20:11.210
( screaming )

20:13.413 --> 20:16.516
Okay, you don't have
a job here,

20:16.549 --> 20:18.318
so we are taking you
to Michigan.

20:18.351 --> 20:19.386
No, Dad.

20:19.419 --> 20:20.520
It's a good hospital.

20:20.553 --> 20:22.322
Dermatology is
a lucrative field.

20:22.355 --> 20:23.590
It's not what I want.

20:23.623 --> 20:25.258
What do you want?
To be like this man here?

20:25.292 --> 20:26.926
Ajay...

20:26.959 --> 20:29.296
I don't know, that's what
I'm trying to tell you.

20:29.329 --> 20:31.364
I have heard enough.

20:31.398 --> 20:34.000
Ajay, will you
go get us a cab?

20:34.033 --> 20:35.468
Excuse me?

20:37.704 --> 20:38.971
We are getting your things,

20:39.005 --> 20:41.474
we'll rent a car
and then we'll go.

20:41.508 --> 20:42.442
And that's final!

20:47.347 --> 20:49.416
He doesn't get it, Mum.

20:49.449 --> 20:52.385
You think he doesn't get it?

20:52.419 --> 20:53.786
We get it.

20:53.820 --> 20:55.322
You're the one
that doesn't get it.

20:55.355 --> 20:56.723
Oh, don't you start in
on me now.

20:56.756 --> 20:58.558
Neela, when I
married your father,

20:58.591 --> 21:00.860
I was younger than you are.

21:00.893 --> 21:04.764
Sure, I loved him, but
do you think I didn't have
grander ideas for my life

21:04.797 --> 21:06.933
than running
a curry house
in Southall?

21:06.966 --> 21:08.935
Well, then let me find
my own path.

21:08.968 --> 21:11.003
Passing up the opportunity
that you have been given

21:11.037 --> 21:12.405
is not the way to do it.

21:12.439 --> 21:13.740
I've worked hard for it.

21:13.773 --> 21:14.974
So have we all.

21:15.007 --> 21:16.743
All those years
at the restaurant,

21:16.776 --> 21:18.645
saving, planning
for your future.

21:18.678 --> 21:20.079
I just need some time.

21:20.112 --> 21:21.681
Sorry, love. Time's up.

21:23.916 --> 21:27.620
I've always done everything
you've asked, everything.

21:27.654 --> 21:29.389
Even the damn viola.

21:29.422 --> 21:30.757
When I was a girl,
I had to learn

21:30.790 --> 21:32.392
to play the sheet music
and play it perfectly.

21:32.425 --> 21:33.960
I was never allowed to play
what I wanted.

21:33.993 --> 21:35.562
You wanted to
play rock music!

21:35.595 --> 21:37.063
Or to improvise
or be creative...

21:37.096 --> 21:39.499
You can't improvise
the viola.

21:39.532 --> 21:41.100
You can try.

21:41.133 --> 21:42.802
So, you want to
be a musician now?

21:42.835 --> 21:43.903
No, Mum...

21:43.936 --> 21:45.772
I want to improvise.

21:48.107 --> 21:53.746
En mi país, un hombre estaba
en la parada del autobus.

21:53.780 --> 21:55.915
Me golpeó y me llevó.

21:55.948 --> 21:58.885
A man abducted her
from a bus stop in Mexico.

21:58.918 --> 22:00.620
When did this happen?

22:00.653 --> 22:01.854
Tenia doce años.

22:01.888 --> 22:03.923
You were 12?

22:03.956 --> 22:06.025
How old are you now?

22:06.058 --> 22:08.495
No... no sé.

22:10.963 --> 22:13.600
So, what happened
after the man took you?

22:13.633 --> 22:15.402
Me trajeron aquí,

22:15.435 --> 22:19.772
y me dejaron en un cuarto
con otras chicas.

22:19.806 --> 22:23.042
They make me dañada.

22:23.075 --> 22:25.412
"Damage girl."

22:25.445 --> 22:27.079
What is "damage girl"?

22:27.113 --> 22:33.152
Quando los hombres te pegan,
o hacen lo que quieren contigo.

22:33.185 --> 22:36.556
The men, they hit her,
or do what they want.

22:36.589 --> 22:38.425
Anything they want.

22:40.126 --> 22:42.161
When was the last time
you spoke to your family?

22:42.194 --> 22:45.865
Hace mucho tiempo,

22:45.898 --> 22:47.534
los llame una vez

22:47.567 --> 22:49.168
que con moneda
que me dio un aomre.

22:49.201 --> 22:50.737
Once, a long time ago,

22:50.770 --> 22:52.138
she snuck off and
called her parents.

22:52.171 --> 22:54.441
Les dije,
no se cuando voy a volver.

22:54.441 --> 22:57.076
She told them she didn't
know when she'd be home.

22:57.109 --> 22:58.545
No lloren.

22:58.578 --> 23:00.980
She told them not to cry.

23:06.919 --> 23:10.590
Okay, Marta,
we're going to help you now.

23:10.623 --> 23:12.459
All right?

23:12.459 --> 23:15.127
Vamos a... ayudarte?

23:15.161 --> 23:17.730
Okay?

23:17.764 --> 23:20.032
My name's not Marta.

23:20.066 --> 23:24.671
My real name is... Tesoro.

23:29.776 --> 23:30.843
We're going, Ajay.

23:30.877 --> 23:32.044
Good.

23:32.078 --> 23:33.646
Home.
Neela's staying here.

23:33.680 --> 23:34.881
What?
I love you, Mum.

23:39.552 --> 23:40.953
Get in the car, Ajay.

23:43.122 --> 23:45.558
I hope you know that we
can't help you anymore.

23:45.592 --> 23:47.059
I'll find a job.

23:47.093 --> 23:50.697
I'll send something
for Rajiv when I can.

23:50.730 --> 23:52.064
When you were little,
you used to tell me

23:52.098 --> 23:53.933
that you always dreamed
of being a bird

23:53.966 --> 23:58.605
so that you could
fly far, far away.

23:58.638 --> 24:01.508
Well, you've finally
done it, haven't you?

24:30.069 --> 24:31.270
PENNY:
I called the factory

24:31.303 --> 24:32.572
where Tesoro said
her parents worked.

24:32.605 --> 24:33.573
Did you talk
to somebody?

24:33.606 --> 24:34.641
Through the translator.

24:34.674 --> 24:35.975
A secretary gave us
this number.

24:36.008 --> 24:38.711
Okay, great. Get Chuny
for me, will you?

24:38.745 --> 24:40.112
She's a real piece of work.

24:40.146 --> 24:41.681
Asking for asylum,

24:41.714 --> 24:43.616
saying she's as much
a victim of the Lenones

24:43.650 --> 24:45.051
as the girls are.
The Lenones?

24:45.084 --> 24:46.886
Organizations of
traffickers and pimps

24:46.919 --> 24:49.556
that bring these girls in
and set them up in houses.

24:49.589 --> 24:50.289
You've seen this
before?

24:50.322 --> 24:52.191
A bit.

24:52.224 --> 24:53.860
She'll be placed into custody
and we'll search the apartment.

24:53.893 --> 24:55.227
What about the girl?

24:55.261 --> 24:57.263
All the girls will be put
into foster care.

24:57.296 --> 24:59.966
Children's Services and
the INS will get into it.

24:59.999 --> 25:01.601
She needs to go home
to her parents.

25:01.634 --> 25:02.635
Yeah.

25:06.739 --> 25:08.040
Hey, where are
your folks?

25:08.074 --> 25:10.843
Gone.

25:10.877 --> 25:12.111
You crying?

25:12.144 --> 25:13.580
No.

25:13.580 --> 25:14.847
Look, I'm sorry.

25:14.881 --> 25:15.982
I'm off at 8:00,
we can talk then.

25:16.015 --> 25:17.617
I'll wait around.

25:17.650 --> 25:19.118
You're gonna wait
around for three hours?

25:19.151 --> 25:21.954
I got nothing better to do.

25:21.988 --> 25:23.856
Okay.

25:23.890 --> 25:26.793
Hey, you don't speak
Spanish, do you?

25:26.826 --> 25:29.596
Punjabi, French,
bit of Farsi,

25:29.629 --> 25:31.130
smattering of German,
some...

25:31.163 --> 25:33.265
All right, all right,
all right.

25:37.236 --> 25:38.705
Hey.

25:40.172 --> 25:41.674
How's your shoulder?

25:41.708 --> 25:44.210
What happens now?

25:44.243 --> 25:48.114
Maybe you can go home
to Mexico.

25:48.147 --> 25:49.281
Quieres?

25:49.315 --> 25:51.350
They don't love me.

25:51.383 --> 25:54.286
They don't want me.

25:54.320 --> 25:57.289
Of course they do.

25:57.323 --> 25:58.758
No more.

26:02.962 --> 26:04.864
Want to call them?

26:08.134 --> 26:12.138
I have a phone number
where I think they'll be.

26:12.171 --> 26:14.006
Maybe we should try.

26:14.040 --> 26:15.207
Too long now.

26:15.241 --> 26:18.645
I've gone too long.

26:18.645 --> 26:20.647
Let's try it.

26:22.181 --> 26:24.784
It's ringing.

26:24.817 --> 26:25.885
Hola.

26:25.918 --> 26:29.388
¿Usted es Senora Delgado?

26:29.421 --> 26:31.858
¿Tiene hija, Tesoro?

26:35.161 --> 26:36.963
Ella esta aqui.

26:45.672 --> 26:48.040
Hello?

26:48.074 --> 26:50.009
Mama?

26:50.042 --> 26:53.212
Te extrano tambien, Mama.

26:53.245 --> 26:54.914
Te amo, Mami.

26:54.947 --> 26:57.383
Did you get any sleep?

26:57.416 --> 26:59.018
What do you think?

26:59.051 --> 27:02.755
So, your mom says that
you don't want the surgery.

27:02.789 --> 27:04.223
It's relatively minor.

27:04.256 --> 27:06.693
They're just going to
touch up your cheek implant.

27:06.726 --> 27:09.929
A drop in
the ocean, right?

27:09.962 --> 27:12.031
Whatever.

27:12.064 --> 27:14.033
Okay.

27:14.066 --> 27:17.704
You a Democrat?

27:17.704 --> 27:21.040
Yeah, most of the time.

27:21.073 --> 27:23.710
People rag on this war.

27:23.743 --> 27:26.112
I say it was a good thing.

27:26.145 --> 27:30.917
Gave a lot of people
their freedom.

27:30.950 --> 27:33.052
It's good that
you feel that way.

27:33.085 --> 27:35.254
Where the hell would I be
if I didn't?

27:38.991 --> 27:40.392
I hear you got engaged.

27:40.426 --> 27:42.094
I was.

27:45.965 --> 27:49.035
Her name's Karen.

27:49.068 --> 27:51.070
What happened?

27:51.103 --> 27:54.741
She tried to come
see me at Bethesda.

27:54.774 --> 27:56.442
I wouldn't let her.

27:56.475 --> 27:59.211
You think she would've
given up on you that easy?

27:59.245 --> 28:02.749
Karen's a good girl,
she's the best.

28:04.483 --> 28:05.952
But sometimes things happen

28:05.985 --> 28:09.355
that even the best people
can't get past.

28:09.388 --> 28:10.489
Maybe in a few years,

28:10.522 --> 28:12.759
I won't think
about her anymore.

28:17.396 --> 28:18.898
MALIK:
What kind of
shark was it?

28:18.931 --> 28:20.199
SAM:
A nurse shark.

28:20.232 --> 28:21.901
KOVAC:
We got a few of those
working here.

28:21.934 --> 28:23.970
JERRY:
Says here they "adapt
well to captivity."

28:24.003 --> 28:25.304
MALIK:
Sounds like a nurse to me.

28:25.337 --> 28:26.873
Not all of us.

28:26.906 --> 28:28.507
"They tend to move slowly

28:28.540 --> 28:31.377
within a relatively
small range during the day."

28:31.410 --> 28:33.045
Watch it.

28:33.079 --> 28:35.247
Nobody has any work
to do today, huh?

28:41.387 --> 28:43.189
Need me to take
a look at that?

28:44.924 --> 28:46.392
This?

28:46.425 --> 28:47.359
It's nothing.

28:49.128 --> 28:50.329
Why don't you
take off early?

28:50.362 --> 28:52.131
We have things
under control here.

28:52.164 --> 28:54.066
I got some
follow-ups to do,

28:54.100 --> 28:55.167
and my vet guy in
curtain two...

28:55.201 --> 28:58.170
I'll take care of it.

28:58.204 --> 29:00.206
Okay. Thank you.

29:04.210 --> 29:05.878
19-year-old male attacked
in Grant Park,

29:05.912 --> 29:07.814
multiple contusions,
complains of belly pain.

29:07.847 --> 29:09.849
Hi, I'm Dr. Lockhart,
can you tell me your name?

29:09.882 --> 29:13.052
Good airway, sats 98.
Pulse 133, B.P. 104/58.

29:13.085 --> 29:13.953
They hit us...

29:13.986 --> 29:15.021
Who hit you, honey?

29:15.054 --> 29:16.455
They hit us with a tire jack.

29:16.488 --> 29:18.891
Initial GCS 15, but
mental status is waning.

29:18.925 --> 29:20.526
Help my boyfriend.
Help Zack first.

29:20.559 --> 29:22.194
Wait here,
I'll check the other one.

29:22.228 --> 29:23.930
20-year-old, blunt trauma
to the head and torso.

29:23.963 --> 29:25.097
Agonal on the scene,
L.M.A. placed,

29:25.131 --> 29:27.099
sats 78/100 percent.

29:27.133 --> 29:28.300
Pulse thready and irregular,
120s.

29:28.334 --> 29:29.568
Flail chest.

29:29.601 --> 29:31.070
Oh, God, are they
going to be okay?

29:31.103 --> 29:32.071
Give us room to work.

29:32.104 --> 29:33.172
Pupils are fixed and dilated.

29:33.205 --> 29:34.406
We were sitting
in the grove,

29:34.440 --> 29:35.842
a bunch of us.

29:35.842 --> 29:36.843
I'd never
been there before.

29:36.843 --> 29:38.177
Belly's tense.

29:38.210 --> 29:39.378
These four guys, they
came out of nowhere.

29:39.411 --> 29:40.446
They just started
beating them.

29:40.479 --> 29:42.849
It's because they were kissing.

29:42.882 --> 29:44.283
I'll take this in T-2,

29:44.316 --> 29:46.285
you and Haleh with
the other guy in trauma one.

29:46.318 --> 29:47.954
This guy's less critical,
shouldn't I stay...

29:47.987 --> 29:49.021
Just go.

29:51.223 --> 29:52.524
Curved kelly.

29:52.558 --> 29:54.126
Sats are 72,
heart rate's dropping.

29:54.160 --> 29:55.261
Sure the ET's
in good position?

29:55.294 --> 29:56.462
I put it through
the cords.

29:56.495 --> 29:57.563
36 French.

29:58.530 --> 29:59.531
What do you hear?

29:59.565 --> 30:01.100
Uh, distant breath sounds.

30:02.334 --> 30:03.035
Whoa.

30:03.069 --> 30:04.303
Whoa!

30:04.336 --> 30:05.905
Okay, I'll tighten up
the clamp.

30:05.938 --> 30:07.306
All right, hook him up,
get the cell saver.

30:07.339 --> 30:10.242
Hemocue's 5.2
after two units of O-neg.

30:10.276 --> 30:12.244
Okay, hang another two
on the rapid infuser.

30:12.278 --> 30:13.379
Start another P.I.V.

30:13.412 --> 30:15.114
He's too clamped down.

30:15.147 --> 30:16.215
Well, set me up
for a subclavian,

30:16.248 --> 30:17.616
I'll do it
right after this.

30:17.649 --> 30:19.151
Ten blade.
Sats down to 68.

30:19.185 --> 30:20.352
It's getting harder to bag.

30:20.386 --> 30:21.587
Bradycardia's 47.

30:21.620 --> 30:23.189
Mig of atropine, amp of epi.

30:23.222 --> 30:24.490
Uh, there's blood
in the ET tube.

30:24.523 --> 30:26.392
Well, suction it.

30:26.425 --> 30:29.028
Call for platelets
and FFP.

30:29.061 --> 30:30.562
( air sucking )

30:30.596 --> 30:31.964
I'm in.

30:31.998 --> 30:33.165
Any blankets in here?

30:33.199 --> 30:34.266
Check in the warmer.

30:38.905 --> 30:40.239
You guys okay?

30:40.272 --> 30:41.974
( alarm )
Lost the pulse.

30:42.008 --> 30:43.409
P.E.A.
Starting compressions.

30:43.442 --> 30:45.444
Sam, get Kovac in here.

30:45.477 --> 30:46.913
Sats are down to 82.

30:46.946 --> 30:48.247
I got a good look at those guys.

30:48.280 --> 30:49.515
I can tell the police.

30:49.548 --> 30:51.884
The grove always seemed safe.

30:51.918 --> 30:54.320
Tom, we're going to put
a tube in your airway
to help you breathe.

30:54.353 --> 30:55.454
20 of etomidate,
100 of sux.

30:55.487 --> 30:56.588
Abby's asking for you.

30:56.622 --> 30:58.190
This guy needs to be
tubed right now.

30:58.224 --> 30:59.658
Where's Howard?
See if he can help.

30:59.691 --> 31:01.060
He's stuck in CT
with a kid in status.

31:01.093 --> 31:02.361
Meds are ready.

31:02.394 --> 31:04.596
Okay. We're going to
send you to the O.R.

31:04.630 --> 31:06.298
so surgeons can
stop the bleeding, okay?

31:06.332 --> 31:08.334
Zack... how is he?

31:08.367 --> 31:09.635
His belly's
blowing up.

31:09.668 --> 31:10.937
He's going to need
another crit.

31:10.970 --> 31:12.271
Okay, he's out.

31:12.304 --> 31:14.606
They'll be able
to fix it, right?

31:16.675 --> 31:17.643
The surgeons.

31:17.676 --> 31:18.677
They'll stop the bleeding.

31:18.710 --> 31:20.279
That's what you said.

31:20.312 --> 31:22.181
They're going to do
everything they can.

31:22.214 --> 31:23.615
What's that mean?

31:23.649 --> 31:25.117
Tube.

31:25.151 --> 31:26.218
( alarm )

31:26.252 --> 31:27.519
He's really tachy, 145.

31:27.553 --> 31:29.188
What do you mean
"everything they can"?

31:29.221 --> 31:30.122
He was just talking to me.

31:30.156 --> 31:33.359
Okay, page Corday again.

31:33.392 --> 31:36.295
You can't just kill people
for kissing in the park.

31:36.328 --> 31:37.263
Robert!

31:37.296 --> 31:38.264
Don't go in there.

31:38.297 --> 31:39.565
Hold compressions.

31:39.598 --> 31:41.367
( alarm )
Still P.E.A.
Rate 38.

31:41.400 --> 31:42.401
What's happening?

31:42.434 --> 31:43.435
You need to
let them work.

31:43.469 --> 31:44.570
Resume compressions.

31:44.603 --> 31:45.972
How long since
the last epi?

31:45.972 --> 31:47.306
About 30 seconds.
Atropine?

31:47.339 --> 31:48.540
MALIK:
Just pushed it.

31:48.574 --> 31:50.142
How much fluid?
Liter of L.R.,

31:50.176 --> 31:52.311
seven units O-neg, and
another two going in.

31:52.344 --> 31:53.980
Um, can I switch out?

31:53.980 --> 31:55.147
My arms are
getting tired.
Check the I.V.s.

31:55.181 --> 31:56.648
Maybe the meds
aren't getting in.

31:56.682 --> 31:58.417
We got good flow
through all the lines.

31:58.450 --> 32:00.552
Okay, no pneumo, not tamponade,

32:00.586 --> 32:04.056
temp's okay, tube's good,
got bicarb.

32:04.090 --> 32:05.257
The obvious cause
is hypovolemia.

32:05.291 --> 32:06.392
We're slamming fluids in.

32:06.425 --> 32:08.027
Can you check the pupils again?

32:08.060 --> 32:10.997
Tox screen's back, negative.

32:11.030 --> 32:12.631
Thoracotomy?

32:12.664 --> 32:14.166
Not with blunt trauma.

32:14.200 --> 32:16.035
Fixed and dilated.

32:16.068 --> 32:17.603
Should I put in a central line?

32:17.636 --> 32:19.705
You think that would make
a difference at this point?

32:20.706 --> 32:22.341
Haleh?

32:22.374 --> 32:25.244
You have three large-bore
I.V.s with good flow.

32:25.277 --> 32:26.512
But if we had central access,
maybe we could

32:26.545 --> 32:29.115
get the blood
in faster.

32:29.148 --> 32:30.116
Sam?

32:30.149 --> 32:31.283
Maybe.
I don't know.

32:31.317 --> 32:35.021
Okay, two liters
out of the chest.

32:35.021 --> 32:37.389
If anybody has any opinion
about this, please speak up.

32:45.531 --> 32:47.066
It's your call, Abby.

32:47.099 --> 32:48.434
You're the doctor.

32:56.608 --> 32:58.610
Hey, Dr. Carter.

32:58.644 --> 32:59.578
( clears throat )

32:59.611 --> 33:01.080
Patrick.

33:01.113 --> 33:03.282
I get you an iced coffee
and a BLT right away.

33:06.685 --> 33:08.720
Maybe something else today.

33:27.773 --> 33:28.774
Holding compression.

33:28.807 --> 33:31.077
Junctional rhythm, 24.

33:31.110 --> 33:32.078
No pulse.

33:32.111 --> 33:33.079
What's our time?

33:33.079 --> 33:34.146
42 minutes.

33:36.682 --> 33:38.417
( clears throat )

33:38.450 --> 33:39.485
Is there anything
you want to say to him?

33:58.670 --> 33:59.605
Thank you.

34:03.709 --> 34:05.277
You made me strong.

34:09.248 --> 34:11.650
You let me see who I was.

34:13.652 --> 34:16.121
And to know that it was okay.

34:20.692 --> 34:22.128
Come on, Robert.

34:22.128 --> 34:24.130
Let's go talk
to the police now, okay?

34:28.367 --> 34:30.569
I didn't know
I was gay

34:30.601 --> 34:31.670
until they became

34:31.703 --> 34:33.472
my friends.

34:43.748 --> 34:44.750
4:53 p.m.

34:48.620 --> 34:50.255
KOVAC:
Guide wire back.

34:50.289 --> 34:51.822
Run the FFP
and platelets up here.

34:51.857 --> 34:53.525
My guy died.

34:53.559 --> 34:55.293
Can you throw in
a femoral line?

34:55.327 --> 34:56.828
Tell the O.R. if Corday
isn't here soon,

34:56.862 --> 34:58.397
I'll bring him up myself.

34:58.430 --> 35:00.166
Hematoma on the left,
try the right.

35:00.199 --> 35:02.334
Could have used
a little help in there.

35:02.368 --> 35:05.337
B.P.'s dropping,
55 over 44.

35:05.371 --> 35:06.338
Narrowed pulse
pressure.

35:06.372 --> 35:07.573
Muffled heart sounds.

35:07.606 --> 35:10.209
Pericardiocentesis
needle to Abby.

35:10.242 --> 35:11.177
Raise the head of the bed.

35:13.779 --> 35:14.813
Lost the pulse.

35:14.846 --> 35:16.915
Mig of epi,
have atropine ready.

35:16.948 --> 35:18.217
Angle the needle.

35:18.250 --> 35:19.251
I know.

35:19.285 --> 35:21.420
MARQUEZ:
Ectopy on the monitor.

35:22.888 --> 35:24.690
I need another syringe, quick!

35:25.757 --> 35:26.892
Carotid's back.

35:26.925 --> 35:28.327
Good job, Abby.

35:28.360 --> 35:29.428
I'm sorry.

35:29.461 --> 35:30.729
I was on my way
to grand rounds.

35:30.762 --> 35:32.298
Blunt trauma, bleeding out
into the belly.

35:32.331 --> 35:33.865
Complicated by a bloody
pericardial effusion

35:33.899 --> 35:35.467
and tamponade.

35:35.501 --> 35:37.269
Yeah, set up room five
for an emergent ex-lap.

35:37.303 --> 35:38.704
And tell Doctor Edson
he's going to have to do it.

35:38.737 --> 35:40.206
150 cc's out.

35:40.206 --> 35:43.542
Right. Let's get him
upstairs.

35:43.575 --> 35:45.577
Systolic's up to 88.

35:50.782 --> 35:51.883
Nicely done.

35:51.917 --> 35:53.952
You left me alone
in there.

35:53.985 --> 35:55.554
We had two traumas.

35:55.587 --> 35:57.323
Yeah, and last week,
I had to get approval

35:57.356 --> 35:58.524
for everything I did

35:58.557 --> 35:59.558
and now all of a sudden
I'm supposed

35:59.591 --> 36:00.592
to run a code by myself.

36:00.626 --> 36:01.627
Welcome to internship.

36:01.660 --> 36:02.794
I was tentative,
I was unsure.

36:02.828 --> 36:04.230
I was asking the nurses
for advice,

36:04.263 --> 36:06.298
They respect
that openness.

36:06.332 --> 36:07.766
They respond
to being treated
like members of a team.

36:07.799 --> 36:08.800
No, they don't.

36:08.834 --> 36:09.801
You always did.

36:09.835 --> 36:11.870
Luka, the boy is dead,

36:11.903 --> 36:13.972
and I don't think he got
the best possible care.

36:14.005 --> 36:15.774
You're right,
we gave the best
possible care

36:15.807 --> 36:17.476
to the one I thought
we could save.

36:17.509 --> 36:20.379
And we gave the next
best to your guy.

36:20.412 --> 36:21.780
What?

36:21.813 --> 36:23.749
He had coded when
they brought him in, Abby.

36:23.782 --> 36:26.852
He had barely any vitals
and was fixed and dilated.

36:26.885 --> 36:29.555
He was already gone.

36:29.588 --> 36:31.257
So, what?
I never had a chance?

36:31.257 --> 36:32.724
No, he never had a chance.

36:32.758 --> 36:34.326
You'll have another
one sooner than you want.

36:34.360 --> 36:36.262
15 minutes, an hour,
tomorrow maybe.

36:38.029 --> 36:39.531
You're still here?

36:39.565 --> 36:40.766
Jerry's got me addicted
to this game

36:40.799 --> 36:41.833
where you zap zombies.

36:41.867 --> 36:42.934
Oh, you missed
that guy!

36:42.968 --> 36:44.270
Which one's that?
Pain Killer?

36:44.270 --> 36:45.271
Yeah.

36:45.271 --> 36:47.005
Hello again.

36:47.038 --> 36:48.440
I thought
you went home.

36:48.474 --> 36:50.476
Just something
I meant to do.

36:50.509 --> 36:52.344
You okay, John?

36:52.378 --> 36:53.512
Yeah, I just got
to talk to this guy
for one second.

36:53.545 --> 36:54.313
Can we talk?

36:54.346 --> 36:55.481
Just one minute.

36:55.514 --> 36:57.883
Thought you were gone.

36:57.916 --> 36:59.585
Call Karen, okay?

36:59.618 --> 37:01.387
Bad things happen
to everybody,

37:01.420 --> 37:02.821
but you two have to at least
take a shot

37:02.854 --> 37:04.356
at getting through this.

37:04.390 --> 37:05.524
So...

37:07.493 --> 37:08.894
call her, okay?

37:08.927 --> 37:10.562
You can live through this,
you can live through

37:10.596 --> 37:11.730
all of this.

37:11.763 --> 37:13.365
But you may never
get over losing her.

37:13.399 --> 37:14.733
Dr. Carter.

37:14.766 --> 37:16.635
Let's take a walk, John.

37:16.668 --> 37:18.570
Call her.

37:18.604 --> 37:19.671
You hear me?

37:19.705 --> 37:20.806
ABBY:
Yeah, he heard you.

37:23.942 --> 37:25.777
Call her!

37:25.811 --> 37:26.778
Is he all right?

37:26.812 --> 37:28.380
Yeah, he's fine.

37:28.414 --> 37:29.915
The lady from CPS is here.

37:29.948 --> 37:31.850
Thank you.

37:31.883 --> 37:34.320
Hi, I'm Dr. Lockhart.

37:34.320 --> 37:35.321
You're from Children's Services?

37:35.354 --> 37:36.488
Marie Barclay.

37:36.522 --> 37:37.989
I'm here for
Marta Delgado.

37:38.023 --> 37:39.358
Her name's Tesoro.

37:39.391 --> 37:40.359
They told me "Marta."

37:40.392 --> 37:41.927
No. So when
can she go home?

37:41.960 --> 37:44.062
We'll be in touch
with the Mexican consulate,

37:44.095 --> 37:45.597
they'll locate
the family

37:45.631 --> 37:46.965
and then we'll send someone
to pick her up.

37:46.998 --> 37:48.600
The family's very poor.

37:48.634 --> 37:49.735
We'll figure it out.

37:49.768 --> 37:50.936
And how long
will that take?

37:50.969 --> 37:52.971
Well, she'll be placed
in foster care

37:53.004 --> 37:54.640
until the INS clears her.

37:54.673 --> 37:56.408
Once that happens,
should be a few months.

37:56.442 --> 37:57.843
Like, two?

37:57.876 --> 37:59.345
Six, eight months
at the most.

37:59.378 --> 38:00.746
Of getting bounced around

38:00.779 --> 38:02.348
from one
foster family
to another?

38:02.348 --> 38:03.582
I don't think this
girl can take that.

38:03.615 --> 38:05.617
We'll do our best
to look after her.

38:09.655 --> 38:10.789
Sorry. Okay.
I'll go get her.

38:10.822 --> 38:12.090
Just wait here.

38:12.123 --> 38:13.692
I have a family conference
in an hour.

38:13.725 --> 38:14.693
Will it be long?

38:14.726 --> 38:15.994
No, I'll make it quick.

38:18.764 --> 38:19.831
The train station?

38:19.865 --> 38:21.533
She'd need I.D.
at an airport.

38:21.567 --> 38:22.801
Do you have any money?
I'll pay you back.

38:22.834 --> 38:24.370
Do you know
what you're doing?

38:24.370 --> 38:25.704
Yeah. I'm going to
call her parents

38:25.737 --> 38:26.738
and tell she'll be
there in two days.

38:26.772 --> 38:28.574
Here, here's all my cash.

38:28.607 --> 38:30.576
Take this cred...
No, take that one.
Take this one.

38:30.609 --> 38:32.578
I can't just hop in a cab
and whisk her away.

38:32.611 --> 38:34.646
What, do you have something
better to do?

38:34.680 --> 38:35.814
Uh, I go?

38:35.847 --> 38:38.517
Yeah, honey.
You go now, okay?

38:38.550 --> 38:39.518
Your name?

38:39.551 --> 38:40.519
Abby.

38:40.552 --> 38:41.920
Muchas gracias, Abby.

38:43.989 --> 38:46.024
Okay, you got to run.

38:50.596 --> 38:51.830
And don't take her
through the bay.

38:51.863 --> 38:52.998
Take her out the front.

38:56.802 --> 39:00.739
CARTER:
I don't know
what happened.

39:00.772 --> 39:03.942
You've had a rough time.
It's not hard to understand.

39:05.076 --> 39:06.645
I guess...

39:06.678 --> 39:10.449
I just thought
it would help somehow.

39:10.482 --> 39:11.817
Help what?

39:15.721 --> 39:18.657
What else is going on?

39:18.690 --> 39:20.726
Nothing.

39:20.759 --> 39:22.428
I'm fine.

39:24.430 --> 39:26.432
You looked bad all day.

39:26.465 --> 39:27.633
I wasn't the only one
who noticed.

39:29.435 --> 39:31.703
Well, I did get hit in the head
by a psycho patient.

39:39.945 --> 39:41.480
You can talk
to me, John.

39:48.587 --> 39:50.121
I've been having trouble
sleeping.

39:56.828 --> 39:58.797
I keep having these dreams.

40:04.470 --> 40:05.737
I miss her.

40:09.508 --> 40:11.009
And I miss the baby.

40:16.181 --> 40:17.683
And I miss all the stuff

40:17.716 --> 40:19.751
I thought
we were going to have.

40:19.785 --> 40:21.887
( clears throat )

40:29.127 --> 40:31.830
And I don't know how
to get any of it back.

40:38.770 --> 40:39.805
Here's your ticket:

40:39.838 --> 40:41.873
Chicago to LA,
LA to San Diego,

40:41.907 --> 40:43.575
then a bus to Tijuana.

40:43.609 --> 40:45.544
This envelope
has $200 in it.

40:45.577 --> 40:47.178
It's yours.
Keep it safe.

40:47.212 --> 40:49.715
The train leaves from track 11
in five minutes, okay?

40:49.748 --> 40:51.149
Okay, good luck.

40:53.719 --> 40:55.654
You need to get
on that train now.

40:55.687 --> 40:57.723
No se como.

40:57.756 --> 40:59.157
Tengo miedo.

41:01.827 --> 41:04.129
It's, it's all right,
you can do it.

41:04.162 --> 41:05.664
It's simple, tickets, money.

41:11.703 --> 41:13.672
Dr. Lockhart,
I'm still waiting.

41:13.705 --> 41:15.140
Oh, yeah. I'm sorry.
I feel terrible,

41:15.173 --> 41:16.842
but when I went to get Tesoro,
she wasn't there.

41:16.875 --> 41:18.076
I think she ran off.

41:18.109 --> 41:19.545
Did you have someone
watching her?

41:19.545 --> 41:20.712
A med student.

41:20.746 --> 41:22.213
And I have a nurse
looking for her now.

41:22.247 --> 41:23.281
I have to call
my office.

41:23.314 --> 41:24.816
You people need
better security.

41:24.850 --> 41:25.884
We say that every year.

41:29.755 --> 41:31.557
Hi.
Hey.

41:32.691 --> 41:33.725
I lost my cell phone.

41:36.161 --> 41:38.063
There's a meeting
over at St. John's

41:38.096 --> 41:40.198
if you want me
to go with you.

41:40.231 --> 41:41.900
Yeah. No, that's
all right. I'm okay.

41:41.933 --> 41:44.069
I... just a little slip.

41:46.738 --> 41:47.906
After all the crap
I used to give you.

41:47.939 --> 41:48.940
I'm kind of a hypocrite.

41:48.974 --> 41:51.577
No. We're all hypocrites.

41:52.811 --> 41:53.912
You need a ride home?

41:53.945 --> 41:55.213
No, I took the train.

41:55.246 --> 41:56.247
See you tomorrow.

41:56.281 --> 41:57.816
Yeah.

41:57.849 --> 42:00.619
Hey, what do you want me
to do with the med records

42:00.652 --> 42:01.653
on the vet guy?

42:01.687 --> 42:04.055
Um, I'll take 'em.

42:04.089 --> 42:06.592
I'll have them
sent up to the O.R.

42:11.697 --> 42:12.631
Luka!

42:15.333 --> 42:16.835
I thought you're still on.

42:16.868 --> 42:19.738
For awhile, yeah.

42:19.771 --> 42:24.042
Uh, you know what
you said earlier
over on the steps?

42:27.245 --> 42:29.047
Me, too.

42:30.982 --> 42:35.821
So... come on by later,
and I'll make you some eggs.

42:37.956 --> 42:38.890
Okay.

42:41.860 --> 42:42.828
Hey!

42:45.731 --> 42:47.666
( laughs )

43:30.876 --> 43:33.144
Hey, Kem, it's John.

43:35.146 --> 43:36.682
I know that you're sleeping.

43:36.682 --> 43:39.685
I just, um, wanted
to hear your voice.

44:27.933 --> 44:29.835
No family?

44:29.868 --> 44:32.037
College student
from Milwaukee.

44:37.075 --> 44:38.810
You know, Haleh,

44:38.844 --> 44:40.746
if there's ever anything
you think I'm doing wrong...

44:40.746 --> 44:44.082
You did everything
you could, Abby.

44:44.115 --> 44:46.017
It was a good code.

44:47.305 --> 44:53.359
