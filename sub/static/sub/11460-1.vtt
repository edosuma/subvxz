WEBVTT

00:48.948 --> 00:51.216
- This guy
is a total freak.

00:51.218 --> 00:54.019
But I'm telling you, he's
growing weed in there.

02:23.409 --> 02:24.843
- Hold it.

02:25.945 --> 02:27.412
New jacket?

02:30.850 --> 02:34.119
You really gotta
get a girlfriend, dude.

02:34.121 --> 02:35.587
See you tomorrow.

05:08.474 --> 05:09.875
- What are you doing in my home?

05:30.263 --> 05:31.596
- Katlyn?

05:33.333 --> 05:36.068
- No.
I didn't kill her!

05:37.838 --> 05:38.870
- Get away, you freak!

05:49.515 --> 05:51.083
- Hey! Hey!
I didn't kill her.

05:51.085 --> 05:52.918
She was laying there
when I came in!

05:54.721 --> 05:55.721
- Please!

07:09.695 --> 07:10.462
- Does it hurt?

07:40.092 --> 07:41.626
- You really want one
of those don't you?

07:52.873 --> 07:54.606
Go on! Get!

07:54.608 --> 07:56.441
Go!

07:57.743 --> 07:59.211
Filthy creatures.

08:00.179 --> 08:02.080
They carry germs and disease.

08:10.590 --> 08:12.858
You wouldn't wanna make
mother sick would you?

08:15.394 --> 08:20.031
Besides, young boys can't
afford to be sympathetic.

08:22.401 --> 08:24.536
Not even to a filthy mongrel.

08:26.540 --> 08:27.772
Jesus Christ.

08:33.078 --> 08:35.447
What in god's name
are you wearing?

08:35.448 --> 08:36.313
- I made it.

08:36.816 --> 08:38.183
This is my medical.

08:38.184 --> 08:39.951
This is my bird watching.

08:39.953 --> 08:42.120
- Do you know what those
troop leaders feed on?

08:42.121 --> 08:44.856
The innocence of little boys.

08:44.858 --> 08:48.093
And I'm not gonna let some
sicko pedophile touch my child!

08:51.364 --> 08:53.698
Next thing you know, you'll
wanna be an altar boy.

08:54.767 --> 08:56.034
Snap out of it!

08:56.036 --> 08:58.670
Mother didn't raise you
to be a little bitch.

09:00.673 --> 09:01.973
You're better than that.

09:06.145 --> 09:07.145
That's not for you.

09:07.147 --> 09:08.413
- What is it?

09:10.416 --> 09:11.816
- It's my protection.

09:12.451 --> 09:13.652
Mama needs protection.

09:14.587 --> 09:16.421
Now go make sure the
front door is locked.

09:16.423 --> 09:18.723
- It's locked. I
already checked.

09:20.459 --> 09:22.260
- Well, check it again.

09:24.530 --> 09:26.064
What if some brute of a man,

09:26.066 --> 09:29.234
let himself in here,
raped mother raw,

09:29.236 --> 09:31.069
and then set her on fire?

09:39.145 --> 09:40.946
An unlocked door
is an evil door.

09:56.296 --> 09:57.996
Bless us, oh lord.

10:13.747 --> 10:15.547
Filthy mongrel.

10:59.325 --> 11:00.558
- Good afternoon.

11:01.794 --> 11:03.795
- There was
an accident today?

11:07.834 --> 11:09.167
Under these circumstances,

11:09.169 --> 11:12.270
we canvass the neighborhood,
ask some questions.

11:12.272 --> 11:14.305
- Under these circumstances?

11:14.307 --> 11:15.573
- There was a fatality.

11:16.543 --> 11:17.976
Were you home this afternoon?

11:17.978 --> 11:19.144
- I was.

11:19.146 --> 11:20.745
- Did you
witness the accident?

11:24.484 --> 11:27.185
- You're gonna keep
doing this as long as it takes.

11:27.187 --> 11:28.353
- Sir?

11:29.456 --> 11:30.555
- No. No, I didn't.

11:31.757 --> 11:35.593
- Did you see anything
strange or out of the ordinary?

11:35.595 --> 11:37.028
- No. I'm sorry, officer.

11:37.030 --> 11:39.631
I wasn't aware anything happened
until I heard the sirens.

11:39.633 --> 11:42.701
- If you hear of anything
that might be helpful to me,

11:42.703 --> 11:45.804
would you mind giving me a call?

11:48.407 --> 11:50.241
- I'm sorry I wasn't much help.

12:28.380 --> 12:31.349
- Oh, it's a goddamn
mess out there.

12:35.855 --> 12:38.289
What the hell's
wrong with you today?

12:43.362 --> 12:44.629
Oh, looks like you still have

12:44.631 --> 12:46.464
some leftovers from taco night.

12:47.666 --> 12:52.103
I want you to try heating these
on the stove for 20 minutes.

12:52.105 --> 12:53.338
You're never gonna get better,

12:53.340 --> 12:55.406
if you don't work on this stuff.

12:59.645 --> 13:02.614
Do you have to keep
everything you find?

13:02.616 --> 13:05.049
Try throwing something
away, just once.

13:05.051 --> 13:06.885
It might be cathartic.

13:06.887 --> 13:09.020
- A place for everything
and everything in its place.

13:09.022 --> 13:10.688
- Honey, I'm here to help you.

13:10.690 --> 13:12.090
It's my job.

13:12.092 --> 13:13.291
- I know.

13:13.293 --> 13:14.993
- I promised
to take care of you,

13:14.995 --> 13:17.162
and that's exactly
what I'm gonna do.

13:17.164 --> 13:20.598
So get over yourself
and let me in!

13:22.568 --> 13:24.102
Now give me kisses.

13:28.140 --> 13:29.340
Ahh...

13:33.312 --> 13:36.014
Only two of these per day, okay?

13:42.388 --> 13:44.656
You've gotta work on this stuff.

13:54.834 --> 13:56.568
- What am I gonna do with you?

16:33.759 --> 16:35.293
- The hell you
doing in here, boy?

16:35.295 --> 16:36.828
- Ow! Ouch...

16:40.199 --> 16:41.332
- It's lunch time.

16:49.908 --> 16:53.811
Oh, man. She was a
crazy bitch, dude.

16:53.813 --> 16:55.480
Oh, and those curves.

16:57.317 --> 17:01.219
I ended up spending
the entire weekend in Aspen.

17:01.221 --> 17:02.687
Or as I like to call it,

17:02.689 --> 17:05.790
a drinking town with
a skiing problem.

17:11.063 --> 17:11.996
Man...

17:11.998 --> 17:13.731
Oh, I got another one for you.

17:19.204 --> 17:20.505
Boink!

17:26.078 --> 17:27.045
Right?

17:33.385 --> 17:34.452
- It's a good one.

17:34.454 --> 17:35.953
- Yeah, it's just dope.

17:41.660 --> 17:42.760
Thought you'd like it.

17:43.662 --> 17:45.863
I found it the other
day by the carousel.

17:53.305 --> 17:57.008
God, this park gets lonely
in the off-season, huh?

18:00.913 --> 18:02.246
- I kind of like it.

18:02.848 --> 18:04.582
- What? No.

18:05.851 --> 18:10.855
No, there's no excitement,
no energy, no women...

18:12.091 --> 18:13.458
You're the one who's
always complaining

18:13.460 --> 18:15.393
about not having any friends.

18:24.571 --> 18:25.903
I'm telling you, dude.

18:36.982 --> 18:38.916
What are you smiling about?

18:41.253 --> 18:42.286
- Nothing.

18:43.055 --> 18:44.155
- Nothing?

18:46.692 --> 18:48.626
Oh, there's something!

18:49.761 --> 18:50.928
Come on.

18:54.134 --> 18:55.666
I caught a big one.

19:02.574 --> 19:03.908
- I met someone.

19:06.678 --> 19:07.845
- What?

19:08.747 --> 19:10.114
You met someone?

19:10.116 --> 19:11.015
- Yes.

19:11.383 --> 19:12.450
- Dude!

19:14.753 --> 19:17.421
Yeah! That's great.

19:18.390 --> 19:19.590
That's great, bro.

19:19.592 --> 19:21.259
- Yeah. She's like me.

19:21.261 --> 19:22.827
She doesn't like big crowds.

19:23.997 --> 19:26.197
- Then you can stay
inside. You know?

19:26.199 --> 19:27.999
- She likes staying in.

19:28.001 --> 19:30.034
- Oh, I bet she does.

19:32.071 --> 19:33.971
That's what I'm talking about.

19:52.691 --> 19:54.959
- An unlocked door
is an evil door.

25:37.235 --> 25:38.736
- Taco night.

25:39.504 --> 25:40.704
Chicken with rice.

25:42.908 --> 25:45.276
Taco night. Chicken with rice.

25:46.244 --> 25:48.846
Chicken with
rice. Chicken with rice.

25:48.848 --> 25:50.314
Chicken with rice.

25:50.316 --> 25:54.051
Chicken with rice. Chicken
with rice. Chicken with rice.

25:54.053 --> 25:57.021
Chicken with rice.
Chicken with rice.

25:57.023 --> 26:00.624
Chicken with rice.

26:00.626 --> 26:04.929
Chicken with rice.

26:04.931 --> 26:06.830
Rice. Rice. Rice. Rice.

26:33.692 --> 26:34.825
Oh,
father, lord in heaven,

26:34.827 --> 26:36.126
thank you very much
for these gifts

26:36.128 --> 26:37.261
that we are about to receive.

26:38.431 --> 26:39.363
Thank you very much
for these moments

26:39.365 --> 26:40.798
that we're spending together.

26:42.969 --> 26:45.469
In the name of the father,
the son, and the holy ghost.

26:45.471 --> 26:47.471
Amen.

27:27.912 --> 27:29.079
Much better.

28:08.319 --> 28:11.422
Hmm, pretty good.

28:50.061 --> 28:52.463
Okay, now what?

29:03.308 --> 29:05.843
You're heavy.

29:13.151 --> 29:14.785
I need a better system.

30:04.035 --> 30:04.802
It's for your own good.

30:36.935 --> 30:38.135
Yeah.

30:39.637 --> 30:42.439
This, however, is
not gonna work.

31:16.574 --> 31:17.708
Good night, mother.

31:37.929 --> 31:39.930
Do god's will and
take your pill.

31:52.443 --> 31:54.244
Please bless mother and me.

31:55.346 --> 31:56.747
And all of the
wonderful memories,

31:56.749 --> 31:58.015
that we Cherish
together in life.

31:58.017 --> 31:59.216
Amen.

32:40.124 --> 32:41.725
Here we go.

32:41.727 --> 32:42.793
- Anyways...

32:42.795 --> 32:44.194
- Crazy big!

32:44.196 --> 32:46.830
- I was reading a book with
my book club yesterday,

32:46.832 --> 32:49.266
and I thought of you,
because the main character,

32:49.268 --> 32:51.735
finds a way to
overcome his sickness.

33:07.118 --> 33:08.618
- We were
fucking on the cake.

33:08.620 --> 33:10.587
We were fucking in the cake.

33:10.589 --> 33:12.155
We were eating the cake.

33:12.157 --> 33:12.990
We were fucking and
eating the cake.

33:30.843 --> 33:32.209
- Anyways...

33:32.211 --> 33:34.077
- Crazy bitch, man.

33:34.079 --> 33:37.381
- Told those boys
a million times.

33:37.383 --> 33:40.650
You can't use diesel fuel
in that kind of vehicle.

33:55.533 --> 33:57.234
- I'm telling you, you
know how with marathons,

33:57.236 --> 33:58.702
you've got to pace
yourself, man.

33:58.704 --> 34:01.171
Well, Tanya didn't
want any of that.

34:01.173 --> 34:03.440
You know what I'm
saying?

34:20.690 --> 34:21.690
- Anyways...

34:21.693 --> 34:24.694
- She is a top ten crazy bitch.

34:24.696 --> 34:26.596
- You might not
guess this about me,

34:26.598 --> 34:32.302
but in my youth i
was a cliff-diver at
a theme restaurant.

34:32.304 --> 34:34.804
I know it surprises everybody.

34:35.572 --> 34:37.873
- Oh, my fucking god.

34:49.821 --> 34:51.822
- Because there were
dolls everywhere, man.

34:51.824 --> 34:55.058
And you know me, I'm
always ready to go with it.

34:55.060 --> 34:57.928
Have you ever had sex
in front of dolls?

35:20.385 --> 35:21.585
- Anyways...

35:21.587 --> 35:23.120
- This is a
crazy bitch, right?

35:23.122 --> 35:24.421
- I won't be able
to stop by later,

35:24.423 --> 35:26.256
so I thought I'd drop by
and give you your pills,

35:26.258 --> 35:27.157
and see if you need anything.

35:27.159 --> 35:28.358
Gotta run. Bye.

35:39.604 --> 35:42.639
- This woman
is a crazy bitch.

35:42.641 --> 35:44.141
And I fucking love her.

35:44.143 --> 35:47.077
I think I love her and that's
just crazy enough, you know?

35:47.079 --> 35:48.645
That's crazy in itself.

40:05.236 --> 40:06.936
- You know the rules.

40:27.691 --> 40:29.759
Hold still until it dries.

41:21.178 --> 41:23.746
- Do god's will
and take your pill.

41:35.993 --> 41:38.061
Please bless mother and me.

41:39.029 --> 41:40.330
And all the wonderful memories,

41:40.332 --> 41:42.031
that we Cherish
together in life.

43:59.503 --> 44:00.837
- Good morning to you, Dan.

44:00.839 --> 44:03.840
At least 50 police
officers, including the FBI,

44:03.842 --> 44:07.276
are searching right now, over
night using blood hounds,

44:07.278 --> 44:11.180
in temperatures near
freezing, and still no sign.

44:17.788 --> 44:19.255
- And you
know what she does?

44:19.257 --> 44:21.290
This crazy bitch slaps me.

44:22.226 --> 44:23.960
Boom!

44:23.962 --> 44:26.863
Oh, man! Can you even imagine?

44:26.865 --> 44:29.632
- Crazy.
- - Yeah, right?

44:29.634 --> 44:31.267
I'm telling you.

44:31.269 --> 44:34.003
Crazy bitch. That's
how I like 'em.

44:35.139 --> 44:36.105
Oh, hey...

44:36.907 --> 44:39.308
I found another set,
by the coasters.

44:45.749 --> 44:48.151
So what do you do with
these keys, anyway?

44:49.119 --> 44:50.787
- Keys are for unlocking.

44:52.556 --> 44:55.758
- You're so emo sometimes, dude.

44:55.760 --> 44:57.160
- I like to imagine the
story that goes along

44:57.162 --> 44:58.594
with each one of them.

44:58.596 --> 45:00.496
- Well, some idiot
left them in his pocket,

45:00.498 --> 45:04.200
got on a roller coaster,
and they fell out.

45:04.202 --> 45:05.301
The end.

45:06.403 --> 45:07.770
End of story.

45:08.639 --> 45:09.839
Nothing more.

45:10.507 --> 45:12.275
Did I ever tell you about Becca?

45:13.644 --> 45:16.713
Becca? It's British. Becca.

45:16.715 --> 45:19.382
Anyway, she wants to meet
up with me at a club, right?

45:19.384 --> 45:22.118
So I show up. Guess
what she's wearing?

45:23.020 --> 45:24.487
A fucking burka.

45:24.489 --> 45:25.888
I'm not gonna lie.

45:25.890 --> 45:27.657
I was a little turned on.

45:33.230 --> 45:34.464
- Hey, pumpkin.

45:34.466 --> 45:36.365
- God, I wish
you wouldn't do that.

45:36.367 --> 45:38.167
You know, it's polite
to knock, okay?

45:38.169 --> 45:39.769
- So, I was talking to Lois.

45:39.771 --> 45:43.573
Good heavens. What do you
need with all this ice?

45:43.575 --> 45:45.475
Anyways, what was I saying?

45:45.477 --> 45:46.375
- Anyway.

45:46.377 --> 45:47.276
- What?

45:47.278 --> 45:48.778
- That word is anyway.

45:48.780 --> 45:50.046
There isn't an s.

45:50.048 --> 45:51.914
- Whatever you say.

45:51.916 --> 45:53.850
Anyway...

45:54.685 --> 45:56.753
Lois says that there's
scientific proof

45:56.755 --> 45:58.988
that cats are good
for healing the soul.

45:58.990 --> 46:00.490
You should get one.

46:01.024 --> 46:02.558
- I don't like cats.

46:02.560 --> 46:04.127
- Well,
that doesn't matter.

46:04.129 --> 46:05.561
The cat will like you.

46:07.397 --> 46:08.865
What is this?

46:10.234 --> 46:12.034
- That's not mine.

46:12.036 --> 46:13.503
- I can see that.

46:14.505 --> 46:17.306
- Is this another
one of your finds?

46:17.308 --> 46:18.407
- It's my girlfriend's.

46:18.409 --> 46:21.077
- Girlfriend?
Since when?

46:22.846 --> 46:25.114
- I thought you might get mad.

46:25.116 --> 46:27.817
- Mad? I haven't
been this happy,

46:27.819 --> 46:30.219
since my uncle Dave keeled off.

46:30.221 --> 46:32.488
When do I get to meet her?

46:32.490 --> 46:35.258
- Well, she's kind
of a home-body.

46:35.260 --> 46:37.593
- Oh, that's so cute.

46:37.595 --> 46:40.263
Don't worry, i
won't embarrass you.

46:41.832 --> 46:44.834
Oh, this makes me so happy.

46:44.836 --> 46:46.235
Now give me kisses.

46:50.174 --> 46:53.309
Oh, you know what
else Lois told me?

46:53.311 --> 46:56.045
Sarah, down the
street, has chlamydia.

46:56.047 --> 46:57.680
Can you believe it?

46:57.682 --> 46:59.649
She's married for 12 years.

46:59.651 --> 47:02.084
I mean, how does that happen?

47:02.086 --> 47:04.353
I don't know if she's getting
something on the side,

47:04.355 --> 47:07.590
or maybe he is, but somebody
came home with something.

47:50.602 --> 47:51.667
- Police, open up!

47:56.107 --> 47:58.774
- An unlocked
door is an evil door.

47:59.843 --> 48:00.776
- Afternoon.

48:01.478 --> 48:02.745
- Can I help you?

48:02.747 --> 48:03.846
- Yeah, we're looking
into the disappearance

48:03.848 --> 48:05.114
of a young woman.

48:06.149 --> 48:07.617
- Recognize her?

48:07.619 --> 48:09.385
- Goes by the name katlyn Kelly.

48:10.220 --> 48:11.854
- No,
can't say that I do.

48:12.890 --> 48:17.193
- Where were you the afternoon
of Monday the eighth?

48:17.195 --> 48:20.763
- I was at work. I
work every Monday.

48:20.765 --> 48:21.664
- And what
time would you say

48:21.666 --> 48:22.398
you got home that evening?

48:23.500 --> 48:25.601
About 5:08.

48:26.637 --> 48:29.071
- Look, we're just trying
to retrace her activities.

48:29.073 --> 48:30.640
We got some reports saying that

48:30.642 --> 48:32.575
she was in the neighborhood
that afternoon.

48:32.577 --> 48:34.677
- There was an accident in
front of your house that day.

48:34.679 --> 48:36.279
- Of
course. Yes, Trisha.

48:36.281 --> 48:37.980
The neighbor girl
that was hit by a car.

48:37.982 --> 48:39.415
- That's right.

48:39.417 --> 48:41.384
- Yeah, what does
this have to do with Trisha?

48:41.386 --> 48:44.086
- Well, katlyn was visiting
Trisha from out of town.

48:44.088 --> 48:46.022
We have some reports saying that

48:46.024 --> 48:49.358
they were spotted together
in this neighborhood.

48:49.360 --> 48:50.293
- That's horrible.

48:51.061 --> 48:52.929
Any idea where she
might have gone?

48:52.931 --> 48:53.930
- No, that's why we're here.

48:55.565 --> 48:57.099
- Well, I apologize
that I don't have

48:57.101 --> 48:58.768
anything to add to what
you're looking for.

48:58.770 --> 49:00.002
- Ah, that's okay.

49:00.004 --> 49:01.771
Look, if you remember
anything unusual

49:01.773 --> 49:03.506
about that day, give us a call.

49:03.508 --> 49:06.475
- Of course officers. I'm
sorry I can't be of any help.

49:28.199 --> 49:30.533
- We're gonna keep
doing this, as long as it takes.

50:24.187 --> 50:25.654
- Shut the fuck up!

52:04.554 --> 52:05.721
Am I dreaming?

52:11.362 --> 52:12.761
- Not ruling anyone out.

52:12.763 --> 52:14.330
- We don't have
a person of interest,

52:14.332 --> 52:16.132
and we're gonna
look at every angle.

52:16.134 --> 52:18.334
We're gonna look at every
angle multiple times.

52:18.336 --> 52:20.603
- Police are searching
vast areas of terrain,

52:20.605 --> 52:22.271
including fields and lakes,

52:22.273 --> 52:25.441
but bad weather kept search
helicopters grounded.

52:39.723 --> 52:41.257
- So, stop
pitying yourself.

52:41.259 --> 52:44.160
And how about girls that fish
for compliments, that is my...

52:44.162 --> 52:45.528
Hey, got any change?

52:46.663 --> 52:48.297
- Yeah?
- Anyways, David.

52:48.299 --> 52:49.865
- Do you know David?
- - Yeah, I know him.

52:51.568 --> 52:52.801
- Hello!

52:54.471 --> 52:55.738
Top of the morning.

52:58.375 --> 53:00.242
Hola. Como estas?

53:00.244 --> 53:02.077
Muy bien. Gracias.

53:04.481 --> 53:07.716
Alright. See you
at noon, Jonathan.

53:08.952 --> 53:10.786
I got plenty 'o stories,

53:10.788 --> 53:13.088
for your enjoyment!

53:55.098 --> 53:57.166
- I can't believe you're
still wearing that outfit.

53:57.168 --> 53:58.767
Well, if you wanna look foolish,

53:58.769 --> 54:01.937
in front of all of these
people, be my guest.

54:01.939 --> 54:03.005
- There it is!

54:17.387 --> 54:18.921
What's wrong, mom?

54:20.023 --> 54:21.557
- It's germs.

54:23.059 --> 54:26.629
The disease and the
rot simmer in the air.

54:27.664 --> 54:29.098
All of these sinners...

54:31.568 --> 54:33.302
It infects my mouth.

54:36.439 --> 54:37.673
Look at them.

54:37.675 --> 54:38.874
Slut.

54:39.943 --> 54:41.510
Adulterer.

54:42.245 --> 54:43.746
Whore.

54:44.781 --> 54:48.684
She's a whore, because she
gets paid to be a slut.

54:48.686 --> 54:49.918
Now grow up.

54:59.462 --> 55:03.132
You're different than these
disgusting little knee-biters.

55:05.802 --> 55:07.236
You're better.

55:08.905 --> 55:09.938
Look at them.

55:11.375 --> 55:14.009
Judging me. Judging you...

55:17.113 --> 55:18.213
It's not your fault.

55:18.215 --> 55:20.516
But it is your responsibility.

55:25.255 --> 55:26.889
Now, give me kisses.

55:42.872 --> 55:45.674
- Every fucking
day. Literally, man!

55:45.676 --> 55:47.443
Every fucking day!

55:47.445 --> 55:49.178
Can you believe that shit?

55:51.815 --> 55:54.950
So how's it going with
your new lady friend?

55:56.586 --> 55:58.921
Alright, I get it.

56:01.725 --> 56:06.295
Oh, hey, remember that girl
Britney I was telling you about?

56:07.465 --> 56:09.498
So the other day,
we're out for wings.

56:09.500 --> 56:11.633
Do you know what
this crazy bitch did?

56:13.304 --> 56:14.837
Three words, man.

56:14.839 --> 56:16.004
Under the table.

56:18.108 --> 56:19.708
I'll let you fill in the blanks.

56:24.914 --> 56:26.048
Hand job.

56:31.121 --> 56:32.421
Alright...

57:48.164 --> 57:49.998
- A filthy house is
the devil's playground.

57:50.000 --> 57:51.867
A filthy house is the
devil's playground.

57:51.869 --> 57:53.802
A filthy house is the
devil's playground.

57:55.038 --> 57:56.738
A filthy house is the
devil's playground.

57:58.074 --> 57:59.675
A filthy house...

57:59.677 --> 58:02.578
A filthy house is the
devil's playground.

58:32.042 --> 58:33.775
- Police! Open up!

58:36.846 --> 58:37.679
- Miss us?

58:38.648 --> 58:41.216
- We've got
a few more questions.

58:41.218 --> 58:42.417
- Make it quick.

58:43.921 --> 58:45.220
- This is your house?

58:45.222 --> 58:45.220
- Yes.

58:47.056 --> 58:49.358
- How long
have you lived here?

58:49.360 --> 58:52.528
- 34 years.
It was my mother's house.

58:52.530 --> 58:53.795
Please, be seated.

58:55.865 --> 58:57.232
- Where's
your mom now?

58:57.234 --> 58:59.301
- She's passed away.

58:59.303 --> 59:00.903
- How long
ago did she pass?

59:00.905 --> 59:02.437
- I was a kid.

59:03.373 --> 59:04.940
But she left to the house to me.

59:04.942 --> 59:07.409
So, when I was 18, I moved back.

59:07.411 --> 59:08.544
These are all her things.

59:09.747 --> 59:12.214
- Yeah? Yeah, we're
working in it right now.

59:12.216 --> 59:13.415
- Am I a suspect?

59:13.417 --> 59:15.784
- Oh, it's
purely preventative.

59:15.786 --> 59:18.854
We're just crossing
some names off a list.

59:18.856 --> 59:20.255
- What lists?

59:20.257 --> 59:23.926
- Well, we're
still looking for this girl.

59:23.928 --> 59:25.961
- I remember the photo.
I still haven't seen her.

59:25.963 --> 59:27.462
- Okay,
so you remember

59:27.464 --> 59:29.598
talking about Trisha
the other day?

59:29.600 --> 59:32.467
The girl who got into the
accident across the street.

59:32.469 --> 59:34.102
- Yes, of course.

59:41.244 --> 59:43.211
- You gonna let us look around?

59:43.213 --> 59:44.646
- Do you have a warrant?

59:54.023 --> 59:56.124
- We wanna
be safe don't we?

59:56.126 --> 59:59.027
We're gonna do this as
many times as it takes.

01:00:01.097 --> 01:00:02.097
Do it again.

01:00:04.234 --> 01:00:05.267
Do it again.

01:00:06.670 --> 01:00:07.502
Do it again.

01:00:09.373 --> 01:00:10.439
Do it again.

01:00:12.076 --> 01:00:13.642
- An unlocked door
is an evil door.

01:00:13.644 --> 01:00:16.178
- You shouldn't let
those men in your house.

01:00:16.180 --> 01:00:17.079
- How'd you get--

01:00:17.081 --> 01:00:18.647
- your back door was open.

01:00:18.649 --> 01:00:19.815
You're slipping.

01:00:22.085 --> 01:00:23.852
An unlocked door
is an evil door.

01:00:23.854 --> 01:00:26.521
- What
are you doing here?

01:00:26.523 --> 01:00:28.290
- Your
door was wide open.

01:00:28.292 --> 01:00:30.225
- They forced
their way into the house,

01:00:30.227 --> 01:00:32.894
and were messing with
all of my things.

01:00:32.896 --> 01:00:34.630
- Well, they'll be back.

01:00:37.433 --> 01:00:38.533
Are you a suspect?

01:00:38.535 --> 01:00:40.969
- No. I don't think so.

01:00:41.504 --> 01:00:42.738
- I'll be back.

01:00:42.740 --> 01:00:44.806
- No. Karen,
what are you doing?

01:00:57.187 --> 01:00:59.087
- Stand up straight.

01:00:59.089 --> 01:01:02.290
A young man's posture is
his compliment to god.

01:01:16.039 --> 01:01:17.739
- They shouldn't
bother you anymore.

01:01:17.741 --> 01:01:19.708
I've told them about
your condition.

01:01:19.710 --> 01:01:20.609
- What?

01:01:20.611 --> 01:01:22.110
- I'm here to protect you.

01:01:23.246 --> 01:01:24.446
- Wait,
what condition?

01:01:24.448 --> 01:01:25.881
- I'll see you tomorrow.

01:01:29.052 --> 01:01:31.119
- I don't have a condition.

01:02:13.931 --> 01:02:14.963
Get a way out!

01:02:36.452 --> 01:02:37.953
- So, last night, right?

01:02:46.195 --> 01:02:48.797
This girl, man, she...

01:03:26.469 --> 01:03:29.171
- A filthy house is
the devil's playground.

01:08:31.774 --> 01:08:33.006
I'm sorry.

01:09:54.891 --> 01:09:56.891
- Do god's will
and take your pill.

01:11:46.735 --> 01:11:48.303
Keep it together.
Just keep it together.

01:11:48.305 --> 01:11:50.338
Just keep it together.
Just keep it together.

01:11:50.340 --> 01:11:52.307
Keep it together.
Just keep it together.

01:12:22.137 --> 01:12:23.404
Good night, mother.

01:12:49.264 --> 01:12:50.798
- Such a good boy.

01:12:50.800 --> 01:12:52.567
Taking care of mother.

01:13:03.679 --> 01:13:05.113
Did you forget something?

01:13:06.215 --> 01:13:08.549
What'll it take to get this
through your thick skull?

01:13:08.551 --> 01:13:11.619
A stove left on is
a house soon gone.

01:13:21.029 --> 01:13:22.897
- Do god's will
and take your pill.

01:15:21.183 --> 01:15:25.419
I saw what you did.

01:15:44.439 --> 01:15:47.008
- Excuse me sir, I am
selling raffle tickets to my

01:15:47.010 --> 01:15:49.644
awards banquet where me
and other young scouts

01:15:49.646 --> 01:15:52.346
from the community
are being honored.

01:15:52.348 --> 01:15:53.414
- What?

01:15:53.416 --> 01:15:55.550
- Eww! What happened
to your arm?

01:15:57.185 --> 01:15:59.086
- Oh, yeah. I fell.

01:15:59.721 --> 01:16:01.656
- Hello, sir. Excuse me sir,

01:16:01.658 --> 01:16:04.191
I am selling raffle tickets
to my awards banquet

01:16:04.193 --> 01:16:06.127
where me and other
young scouts--

01:16:06.129 --> 01:16:07.562
- thank you.

01:16:07.564 --> 01:16:10.031
- Young scouts from the
community will be honored.

01:16:10.033 --> 01:16:11.799
- An unlocked door
is an evil door.

01:16:11.801 --> 01:16:13.267
- And I would
like to know if you would

01:16:13.269 --> 01:16:14.602
be interested in supporting--

01:16:14.604 --> 01:16:16.504
- do god's will
and take your pill.

01:16:41.630 --> 01:16:42.897
Proceed...

01:19:09.044 --> 01:19:09.910
- Mom?

01:19:44.012 --> 01:19:44.945
- Oh, god...

01:20:26.521 --> 01:20:29.190
- Look, i
engraved your initials on it.

01:20:29.192 --> 01:20:30.491
It works.

01:20:47.844 --> 01:20:48.742
Mom?

01:20:56.051 --> 01:20:57.051
Mom?

01:21:12.868 --> 01:21:13.767
Mom?

01:21:14.804 --> 01:21:17.104
Mom? Are you up there?

01:21:22.244 --> 01:21:23.544
Are you in there?

01:21:30.285 --> 01:21:31.218
Mom?

01:21:35.123 --> 01:21:36.790
- You left the door open.

01:21:36.792 --> 01:21:39.360
The germs, they're everywhere!

01:21:42.898 --> 01:21:44.732
They're infecting me.

01:21:49.537 --> 01:21:51.038
I can't get clean.

01:22:09.058 --> 01:22:11.358
Please, help me.

01:23:58.166 --> 01:23:59.666
- Hello, Jonathan.

01:24:00.301 --> 01:24:02.269
- What'd you do with her?

01:24:02.271 --> 01:24:05.105
- Her germs were
beginning to infect my mouth.

01:24:12.747 --> 01:24:14.515
You know, if you love someone,

01:24:14.517 --> 01:24:16.350
you really need
to set them free.

01:24:16.352 --> 01:24:17.418
- Katlyn!

01:24:19.154 --> 01:24:20.320
Katlyn?

01:24:20.322 --> 01:24:21.455
- I did
what you couldn't.

01:24:21.457 --> 01:24:22.656
- Katlyn?

01:24:22.658 --> 01:24:24.591
- I don't know what
you saw in her anyways.

01:24:24.593 --> 01:24:27.027
Did you see those
disgusting lips?

01:24:27.997 --> 01:24:29.496
- Shut up!

01:24:31.499 --> 01:24:36.336
I said shut the fuck up!

01:24:37.272 --> 01:24:38.772
- Skip your pills today?

01:24:41.576 --> 01:24:44.011
I always knew you
were a little bitch.

01:24:53.521 --> 01:24:54.788
- Come on, finish it.

01:24:55.857 --> 01:24:58.759
Do it. Come on! Do it!

01:25:00.361 --> 01:25:03.063
You're even more fucked
up than your mother.

01:25:12.540 --> 01:25:16.910
You see? This is why we
can't have nice things.

01:25:22.750 --> 01:25:24.518
I told you, you need me.

01:25:47.709 --> 01:25:48.942
- I'm sorry.

01:25:51.913 --> 01:25:54.014
Sorry. So, so, sorry.

01:25:55.483 --> 01:25:58.152
I am sorry, so sorry.

01:25:59.954 --> 01:26:02.823
I am sorry. I'm so sorry.

01:26:11.733 --> 01:26:14.201
I am sorry. I'm so sorry.

01:26:26.681 --> 01:26:28.916
I'm so, so, sorry.

01:26:29.517 --> 01:26:32.886
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

01:26:32.888 --> 01:26:36.089
I'm so, so, sorry.

01:26:38.026 --> 01:26:39.293
- Hey, what
do you got for time?

01:26:39.295 --> 01:26:40.994
Hey, 2:48.

01:28:52.093 --> 01:28:53.360
- Fuck it.

01:30:19.914 --> 01:30:21.681
80 million years...

01:30:22.517 --> 01:30:24.518
These were around
with the dinosaurs.

01:30:26.320 --> 01:30:27.654
You know, the word orchid,

01:30:27.656 --> 01:30:29.356
actually comes from
the Greek word orchis,

01:30:29.358 --> 01:30:30.924
which means testicle.

01:30:33.161 --> 01:30:34.661
Well, the myth is that

01:30:34.663 --> 01:30:37.731
this guy orchis wandered
into a festival.

01:30:37.733 --> 01:30:39.299
He had way too much to drink.

01:30:40.334 --> 01:30:42.502
And he found his
way to a beautiful,

01:30:43.838 --> 01:30:46.373
beautiful, hot little,
young priestess.

01:30:47.508 --> 01:30:49.242
He tried to have
his way with her.

01:30:50.144 --> 01:30:51.511
You know what they did?

01:30:52.447 --> 01:30:55.949
They tore him apart,
limb from limb.

01:30:55.951 --> 01:30:58.018
Then, his mother tried to
get the gods to restore him.

01:30:58.020 --> 01:30:59.486
But you know what they did?

01:31:00.154 --> 01:31:01.688
They turned him into a flower.

01:31:03.724 --> 01:31:04.791
A flower...

01:31:08.729 --> 01:31:10.664
I could never understand
why they did that.

01:31:16.471 --> 01:31:18.338
- I think they did it
because they wanted him

01:31:18.340 --> 01:31:20.540
to become what he always was,

01:31:20.542 --> 01:31:22.976
a beautiful, delicate flower.

01:31:22.978 --> 01:31:24.511
- Well, shit!

01:31:25.746 --> 01:31:28.315
It still grows on rotted wood.

01:31:55.177 --> 01:31:57.277
- Sometimes, it's
better to be alone.

01:32:38.853 --> 01:32:41.588
- Please
bless mother and me.

01:32:41.590 --> 01:32:43.089
And all the wonderful memories,

01:32:43.091 --> 01:32:45.759
that we Cherish
together in life.

01:32:45.761 --> 01:32:46.960
Thank you.

01:33:03.178 --> 01:33:04.277
- Got any change?

01:33:04.879 --> 01:33:06.413
That's fucking disgusting.

01:34:19.587 --> 01:34:21.187
- See you at noon.
