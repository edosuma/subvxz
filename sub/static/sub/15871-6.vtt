10:47.314 --> 10:48.713
OKAY.

10:48.715 --> 10:49.948
SO THEY'RE SISTERS?

10:49.950 --> 10:53.418
THAT IS WHAT VANESSA
SAID ON THE PHONE.

10:53.420 --> 10:56.821
I'D NEVER LOSE MY MOTHER
IN THE MAIL.

10:56.823 --> 10:58.123
OKAY. I FINALLY
GOT AHOLD OF CAITLYN.

10:58.125 --> 10:59.724
SHE'S ON HER WAY.

10:59.726 --> 11:01.926
SHE SAID, "DON'T LET THAT CRAZY
VANESSA TOUCH THE URN"

11:01.928 --> 11:03.094
UNTIL SHE GETS HERE.

11:03.096 --> 11:05.764
THAT'S WHAT VANESSA SAID
ABOUT CAITLYN,

11:05.766 --> 11:08.233
ONLY HER LANGUAGE
WAS A BIT MORE, UH, COLORFUL.

11:08.235 --> 11:09.668
SHE SHOULD BE HERE
ANY MINUTE.

11:09.670 --> 11:12.003
SO THIS SHOULD BE INTERESTING.

11:12.005 --> 11:14.806

11:14.808 --> 11:16.307

11:43.270 --> 11:44.903

11:44.905 --> 11:46.938
A CONTEST AS HIGHLY REGARDED
AS "MISS SPECIAL DELIVERY"

IS A SINGULAR OPPORTUNITY

11:48.942 --> 11:50.475

THE DEAD LETTER OFFICE

11:50.477 --> 11:52.477

THAT WAY.

12:15.001 --> 12:16.434

12:16.436 --> 12:20.805
MY AUNT AMELIA, SHE USED TO
KEEP MY UNCLE ELMER'S ASHES

12:20.807 --> 12:22.407
IN THE BOTTOM DRAWER
OF HER BEDROOM DRESSER.

12:22.409 --> 12:24.042
IT WAS VERY UPSETTING.

12:24.044 --> 12:26.144
HE DESERVED TO BE
IN THE TOP DRAWER.

12:26.146 --> 12:27.212
OH, EXCUSE ME?

12:27.214 --> 12:29.147

THERE YOU ARE,
CAITLYN.

12:37.022 --> 12:38.990
YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO COME, NESSA.
I CAN HANDLE THIS.

12:38.992 --> 12:40.325
THAT'S WHAT YOU ALWAYS SAY.

12:40.327 --> 12:41.960
AND LOOK WHERE WE ARE.

12:41.962 --> 12:43.261
AND WHERE ARE WE, VANESSA?

12:43.263 --> 12:44.429
I'M AMAZED
TO FIND YOU ANYWHERE.

12:44.431 --> 12:45.797
AND WHAT IS THAT
SUPPOSED TO MEA--

12:53.540 --> 12:56.407
AND THAT, I SUPPOSE...

12:57.910 --> 13:00.145
...IS MAMA.

13:02.314 --> 13:04.916
SO, NEITHER OF YOU
KNOW ANYONE NAMED MAGGIE?

13:06.085 --> 13:07.252
AFTER THE SERVICE,

13:07.254 --> 13:08.419
I THOUGHT
THE FUNERAL DIRECTOR

13:08.421 --> 13:09.554
WOULD GIVE
THE ASHES TO ME.

13:09.556 --> 13:11.022
OR TO ME.

13:11.024 --> 13:13.258
BUT HE SAID THAT MAMA HAD
MADE OTHER ARRANGEMENTS,

13:13.260 --> 13:15.226
AND WE COULD PROBABLY
EXPECT TO RECEIVE

13:15.228 --> 13:17.028
SOME SORT OF
EXPLANATION IN THE MAIL.

13:17.030 --> 13:19.831
SHE ALWAYS HAD
A FLAIR FOR THE DRAMATIC.

13:19.833 --> 13:21.199
ACTUALLY, SHE WAS
VERY ORGANIZED

13:21.201 --> 13:22.267
AND METHODICAL.

13:22.269 --> 13:24.102
I'M SURE
SHE HAD A REASON.

13:24.104 --> 13:26.004
WELL, LET'S JUST READ THE LETTERS

13:26.006 --> 13:27.906
AND FIND OUT WHAT THEY WERE.

13:27.908 --> 13:29.507

THE URN AND THESE LETTERS

13:29.509 --> 13:32.043
ARE STILL UNDER THE PROTECTION
OF THE U.S. POST OFFICE.

13:32.045 --> 13:33.278
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

13:33.280 --> 13:34.946
HE'S SAYING THAT
EVERYTHING WAS IN A BOX

13:34.948 --> 13:36.247
INTENDED FOR SOMEBODY
NAMED "MAGGIE,"

13:36.249 --> 13:38.383
SO IT HAS TO BE DELIVERED
TO MAGGIE.

13:38.385 --> 13:39.551
WHAT I MEANT WAS,

13:39.553 --> 13:41.953
THEY'RE OUR MOTHER'S ASHES,

13:41.955 --> 13:43.253
THE LETTERS ARE ADDRESSED TO US,

13:43.255 --> 13:44.322
WHY CAN'T WE JUST
CUT TO THE CHASE AND--

13:44.324 --> 13:45.590
I'M SORRY.

13:45.592 --> 13:47.826

A VERY FINE LINE HERE.
