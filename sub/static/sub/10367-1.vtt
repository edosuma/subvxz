<i> When I first met Candy...</ i> </i>

03:07.900 --> 03:09.900
<i> Those were like the 
days of juice...</ i>. </i>

03:11.500 --> 03:13.500
<i> Everything was bountiful... </ i> </i>

03:15.400 --> 03:17.400
<i> Birds filled the sky ...</ i> </i>

03:23.200 --> 03:25.200
<i> a great kindness float
 through us... </ i> </i>

03:34.100 --> 03:36.100
Heaven

03:50.800 --> 03:52.800
Here it is. 

03:58.400 --> 04:00.400
I'm gonna try it your way this time. 

04:09.400 --> 04:11.400
This is just as good this way. 
Honestly. 

04:13.600 --> 04:15.600
Then why don't you do it? 

04:19.399 --> 04:21.399
Schumann, 
Why don't I do it? 

04:22.100 --> 04:24.100
Dan is a follower, Candy. 
Not a leader. 

04:26.400 --> 04:28.400
We stick to snorting, keep it simple. 

04:28.400 --> 04:30.200
You know...
Dare to be different! 

04:32.500 --> 04:34.500
Well I think I'd like to try it in the bath. 

04:36.400 --> 04:38.400
well that's different. 

04:46.400 --> 04:50.400
Candy? 

04:50.400 --> 04:51.400
Candy! 

04:57.000 --> 04:58.000
Schumann, fucking help me! 

04:58.500 --> 04:59.200
<i> What?? </ i> </i>

04:59.400 --> 05:00.000
Come here!

05:02.100 --> 05:04.100
Come here!
Babe?

05:05.400 --> 05:07.400
Oh, Christ! 

05:07.400 --> 05:08.500
Shit, I think that she took too much. 

05:08.900 --> 05:10.900
Babe! 

05:11.800 --> 05:13.800
Fucking saline solution or something?
I need saline solution!

05:14.000 --> 05:15.000
<i> What? </ i> </i>

05:15.000 --> 05:17.000
Fuck it!
Go and get a glass of water... 

05:17.000 --> 05:18.700
Put salt in it! 
Hurry up! 

05:21.400 --> 05:23.400
Come on!
Babe! 

05:23.400 --> 05:25.300
Candy! Look at me! 

05:25.600 --> 05:27.599
<i>How much salt? </ i> </i>

05:27.600 --> 05:28.300
I don't know! HEAPS!

05:28.301 --> 05:30.300
Just fucking stir it! 
Make sure it's dissolved!

05:31.200 --> 05:33.200
Come here!
Oh baby!?? 
Fuck!!

05:33.200 --> 05:40.000
I don't think this works man! 
What the fuck's salt gonna do? 

05:40.001 --> 05:41.500
Shut up! 

05:44.300 --> 05:46.200
Fuck! 
Hold her arm! 

05:46.200 --> 05:47.700
Hold her fucking arm, man! 

05:47.700 --> 05:49.700
Harder! 

05:50.800 --> 05:52.800
This will not be. 

05:52.100 --> 05:54.100
Here we go ... 

05:53.000 --> 05:55.000
No, it's not gonna fucking work!
It's bullshit!! 

05:55.000 --> 05:55.900
Shut up! 

05:55.900 --> 05:57.900
Call an ambulance. 

06:00.000 --> 06:02.000
Here we go. 

06:03.400 --> 06:05.400
Candy, look at me. 

06:05.600 --> 06:07.600
Candy! Candy! 

06:08.000 --> 06:10.000
Candy, Look at me! 

06:10.200 --> 06:12.200
Babe ... 

06:12.800 --> 06:14.800
Bring her back. 

06:15.200 --> 06:17.200
...back. 

06:18.700 --> 06:20.700
Enough with the fucking salt. 

06:23.600 --> 06:25.600
It was beautiful. 

06:26.500 --> 06:28.500
Intense. 

06:37.100 --> 06:39.100
The future or the thing that <i> gleamed. </ i> </i>

06:40.300 --> 06:42.300
<i> The present was so very, very good. </ i> </i>

06:44.500 --> 06:46.500
I wasn't trying to <i> 
wreck Candy's life </ i>. </i>

06:47.200 --> 06:49.200
<i> I was trying to make mine better. </ i> </i>

06:50.600 --> 06:52.600
<i> We wanted to share absolutely everything </ i>. </i>

06:54.500 --> 06:56.500
Especially <i> 
the best bits </ i>. </i>

06:57.000 --> 06:59.000
I want to stay with you 
forever. 

07:01.700 --> 07:03.700
<i> ...and who would'nt! </ i> </i>

07:12.800 --> 07:14.800
It's us! 

07:17.500 --> 07:19.500
It's called "The afternoon of 
extravagant delight. " 

07:20.900 --> 07:22.900
By Candy Wyatt. 

07:24.400 --> 07:26.400
It's beautiful. 

07:26.900 --> 07:28.900
I love it! 

08:28.100 --> 08:30.100
Casper. 

08:30.100 --> 08:32.000
Casper, It's Dan. 

08:32.000 --> 08:34.100
Daniel, hang on!, I'm coming in on a win and a prayer! 

08:35.100 --> 08:36.600
What? 

08:36.600 --> 08:38.600
I'm trying to land 
a Jumbo in Dubai. 

08:38.600 --> 08:40.600
What? 

08:39.600 --> 08:42.600
Casper was like <i> 
the dad you always wanted. </ i> </i>

08:44.000 --> 08:47.000
The one that lets you have lollies and fizzy drinks

08:48.600 --> 08:50.600
<i> he lets you stay up late, </ i> </i>

08:50.600 --> 08:52.000
<i> and watch movies 
late at night. </ i> </i>

08:52.300 --> 08:54.300
Daniel, how are you? 

08:54.500 --> 08:56.500
<i> Casper and I went way back. </ i> </i>

08:56.500 --> 08:57.200
I love you

08:59.400 --> 09:01.400
<i> Is that right? </ i> </i>

08:59.200 --> 09:02.400
Yes! 

09:02.400 --> 09:04.400
This is George. 

09:03.600 --> 09:06.600
A very limited English, 
but a very large penis. 

09:06.600 --> 09:09.900
Isn't that right, George? 

09:09.900 --> 09:11.900
Ok. 

09:11.500 --> 09:15.500
Our entire conversation is based on the 1995 "Lonely Planet" guide to Havana

09:17.000 --> 09:19.000
Sit down. 

09:22.100 --> 09:24.100
Just good friends. 

09:26.400 --> 09:28.400
So, what's on the agenda today? 

09:29.100 --> 09:31.100
<i> Not much, we're just wandering around. </ i> </i>

09:34.100 --> 09:36.100
Um, Could you spare us $50? 

09:36.100 --> 09:40.800
Does is ever embarrassed you, Candy? 
...His naked desperation!

09:40.800 --> 09:43.400
Nakedness, I can deal with! 

09:43.400 --> 09:45.400
Or give us some ecstasy 
we can sell for it? 

09:45.900 --> 09:47.900
I'm afraid that my days 
as a manufacturer of ... 

09:48.000 --> 09:50.900
recreational farmaceuticals
has come to an end. 

09:50.900 --> 09:51.900
Why's that? 

09:52.000 --> 09:54.800
I've been made Associate Professor of
Organic Chemistry. 

09:54.800 --> 09:56.800
-Wow! Congratulations. 
-Great. 

09:57.200 --> 09:59.200
So, suddenly I have a 
reputation to uphold. 

10:00.900 --> 10:02.900
Well in that case, could we make it a hundred? 

10:04.300 --> 10:06.300
We'll pay it back! 

10:18.500 --> 10:20.300
Thanks, Cas. 

10:20.300 --> 10:22.300
Everything's alright, isn't it? 

10:23.900 --> 10:26.400
It's just a cash flow problem. 
Only 7 days.

10:28.400 --> 10:30.400
And you, Candy? 

10:30.400 --> 10:32.900
Being one that's so new to the path 
of the dead! 

10:34.100 --> 10:36.100
She is fine. 

10:37.100 --> 10:41.600
When you can stop, 
people don't want to... 

10:41.600 --> 10:44.600
... and when you want to stop,
You can't! 

10:48.900 --> 10:51.500
One of life's little riddles! 

10:52.100 --> 10:54.100
What Grandma? 

10:55.900 --> 10:56.500
Off you go! 

10:56.500 --> 10:58.500
Thank you, Casper. 

11:00.600 --> 11:02.000
Okay, are you ready? 

11:02.000 --> 11:04.000
One, two, three ... 

11:11.400 --> 11:14.400
I feel like some confused 
Sesame Street character! 

11:55.600 --> 11:57.600
Start the car. 

12:08.200 --> 12:11.700
My own parents had long since 
cut me adrift

12:12.600 --> 12:16.100
<i> The Wyatts, on the other hand, 
kept their firm hold on the ropes. </ i> </i>

12:18.200 --> 12:20.200
Do you want more potatoes? 

12:20.400 --> 12:23.900
-It was nice to visit places 
where the fridge was always full.

12:27.900 --> 12:30.900
I shall have to bring my plate round 
when I come here!

12:30.900 --> 12:34.800
I think you'll find that's part of the carbohydrate.

12:34.800 --> 12:36.800
What do you think? 

12:37.100 --> 12:41.400
I don't know. 
I don't know. 

12:44.900 --> 12:46.900
See how you go. 

12:48.500 --> 12:50.000
Stretchers? 

12:50.500 --> 12:53.500
They're like wooden frames you 
stretch the canvass on. 

12:55.600 --> 12:57.600
and anyway, I feel really stupid ... 

12:58.100 --> 13:01.600
... I did about a month ago, 
and as of tomorrow I'm gonna lose 
our deposit on the stretchers. 

13:04.500 --> 13:06.500
It is really rude to ask ... 

13:09.000 --> 13:11.000
... but at least I won't surprise her! 

13:13.800 --> 13:16.800
I can give you the money back 
the next time I see you again. 

13:17.400 --> 13:19.900
Can you ring him, and tell him to 
wait for a week? 

13:20.300 --> 13:22.300
I already tried that pretty much
last week. 

13:22.600 --> 13:24.600
What if I rang him for you? 

13:27.600 --> 13:29.600
I haven't got the card with me. 

13:31.800 --> 13:33.800
How much is it? 

13:34.100 --> 13:35.900
150. 

13:35.900 --> 13:37.900
Mate, the question is not the money. 

13:38.300 --> 13:40.300
I really appreciate it. 

13:40.900 --> 13:43.900
The question...
is the future of my daughter. 

13:45.900 --> 13:47.900
Mate, she's fantastic!

13:48.600 --> 13:50.600
Should see her paintings! 

13:50.600 --> 13:52.100
The question is you. 

13:52.800 --> 13:54.800
When are you gonna do something? 

13:58.300 --> 14:00.300
I've got some ideas. 

14:02.300 --> 14:05.300
I've sent some of my poems into
Heat magazine. 

14:08.600 --> 14:12.600
Here we are! -Milk... 
and sugar, There! 

14:13.400 --> 14:15.400
-Thanks babe!
-Thanks, Elaine. 

14:16.500 --> 14:18.500
You're not a teenager anymore. 

14:19.200 --> 14:21.200
You know that, don't you? 

14:21.200 --> 14:22.200
Yes, I know that, Jim. 

14:26.400 --> 14:28.400
that is why I did'nt want 
you to do it!

14:28.400 --> 14:30.300
No, it's alright! It's fine! 

14:30.300 --> 14:31.600
Look at it!
You've turned it into butter! 

14:31.600 --> 14:33.700
I told you to keep it on blend! 

14:33.900 --> 14:35.900
I put it on "Whip", because 
I'm whipping cream! 

14:36.200 --> 14:38.200
Yes, but you don't know how to use it. 

14:38.600 --> 14:40.600
Right... You do it!! 

14:40.600 --> 14:43.800
-Uhh!! Well it's too late now!! 
-Ah well!! Excuse me!!

14:43.800 --> 14:46.100
Well all these settings are relatve, and if you're not familiar with the workings of the machine ... 

14:46.800 --> 14:49.800
Then why the fuck does it say "Whip"? 

14:52.700 --> 14:54.700
I'll give them ice cream. 

14:56.500 --> 14:58.500
And please don't swear. 

15:02.500 --> 15:05.000
Right!<i> Well, I was going to give you cream, but I'm going to have to give you Ice Cream. </ i> </i>

15:07.500 --> 15:10.000
<i> - Everything okay in there? 
-Well, we live in hope! </ i>. </i>

15:11.400 --> 15:13.400
<i> A good place to live. </ i> </i>

15:56.500 --> 15:58.500
Go!! 

16:23.700 --> 16:25.700
I wonder if that was it? 

16:25.900 --> 16:27.900
If that was what? 

16:28.600 --> 16:30.600
The last shot. 

16:34.700 --> 16:36.700
I wouldn't care. 

17:03.200 --> 17:05.200
It was my Nana's. 

17:06.500 --> 17:09.000
We're going to sell anything 
We're only hocking it! 

17:09.400 --> 17:11.400
We'll get it back! 

17:32.000 --> 17:34.000
$25. 

17:33.800 --> 17:35.800
...and He doesn't want the paints. 

17:48.800 --> 17:50.800
I'll be back!

17:50.900 --> 17:54.400
He said maybe we could work 
something out!. 

19:08.000 --> 19:10.000
Let's go! 

19:16.200 --> 19:18.200
Yes, I fucked him! 

19:19.400 --> 19:21.400
For $50. 

19:21.700 --> 19:23.700
I stink! 

19:24.200 --> 19:26.200
You okay? 

19:29.000 --> 19:31.000
I'm Sorry. 

19:31.100 --> 19:33.100
Don't be! 

19:45.800 --> 19:48.300
<i> Here is the deepest secret, 
that nobody knows </ i>. </i>

19:49.600 --> 19:52.600
<i> Here is the root of the root, 
and the bud of the bud...</ i> </i>

19:52.800 --> 19:55.800
<i> ...and the sky of the sky, 
in the tree called life </ i>. </i>

19:57.400 --> 20:00.900
<i> which grows higher than soul

20:03.100 --> 20:06.600
<i> ..and this is the one that is 
keeping the stars apart. </ i> </i>

20:08.500 --> 20:10.500
I carry your heart. 

20:11.000 --> 20:13.500
I carry it in my heart. 

20:18.600 --> 20:20.600
Will you marry me? 

20:50.800 --> 20:52.800
We will be man and wife. 

20:53.600 --> 20:55.600
One flesh. 

20:59.500 --> 21:03.800
I will ask them if they freely undertake the obligations of marriage ... 

21:04.000 --> 21:08.000
... and to state that there is no 
legal impediment to the marriage. 

21:09.400 --> 21:12.400
Are you ready, 
freely and without reservation ... 

21:12.600 --> 21:16.400
<i> to give yourself to eachother... 
in marriage?</ i> </i>

21:17.300 --> 21:19.300
<i>We are!</ i> </i>

21:20.500 --> 21:23.300
<i> Are you ready for love 
and honor each other ...</ i> </i>

21:23.500 --> 21:27.500
<i> ... as husband and wife, 
for the rest of your life? </ i> </i>

21:28.400 --> 21:30.400
-We are! 
-We are! 

21:30.400 --> 21:32.400
Candice and Dan ... 

21:37.600 --> 21:39.600
Come back, love. 

21:40.200 --> 21:41.400
Ah, okay. 

21:41.900 --> 21:44.400
Alright everyone, Close together! 
Balloons down, Jenny. 

21:44.600 --> 21:47.000
Big smiles, everyone! 
Happy Day! 

21:47.000 --> 21:48.800
One, two... Oh, Shit! 

21:48.800 --> 21:49.900
Schumann! 

21:49.900 --> 21:53.000
-One, two... Three! 
-Right...  

21:53.000 --> 21:56.200
Alright everyone! 
Back to our place for a few drinks, 
and a bite to eat? 

21:57.100 --> 21:59.600
I'm sorry, I'm going to have to go, 
I've got an appointment!

21:59.600 --> 22:02.100
Oh! Well, I hope that nobody else 
has got an appointment! 

22:02.400 --> 22:04.400
I'm in for the long hall, Mrs. Wyatt. 

22:04.800 --> 22:05.800
Good. 

22:06.400 --> 22:07.900
No, I hate spelling! 

22:07.900 --> 22:09.700
Yeah, me too! Spelling and maths! 

22:09.700 --> 22:11.900
I was always hopeless at 
spelling and maths. 

22:13.000 --> 22:14.000
-I like English. 
-English? 

22:14.000 --> 22:15.000
Like stories and stuff?

22:15.200 --> 22:16.200
Yeah!

22:16.200 --> 22:17.700
English and Sport! 

22:17.700 --> 22:18.500
Well you can't go wrong there. 

22:18.700 --> 22:20.100
You can be a Sports journalist. 

22:20.100 --> 22:20.800
Really? 

22:20.800 --> 22:21.800
I could see you as a 
sports journalist. 

22:22.100 --> 22:24.100
Well, Dan, you're laughing mate! 

22:24.100 --> 22:26.100
Financing this love 
as a married couple. 

22:26.700 --> 22:29.200
You get the first one under your belt,
you pour everything into it. 

22:29.800 --> 22:31.800
After that, the minimum equity is 
what you're after.

22:32.300 --> 22:34.600
You get into as much debt 
as possible. 

22:34.800 --> 22:36.800
It gives you some focus. 

22:36.800 --> 22:40.200
I'm not just talking about
real estate. 

22:40.200 --> 22:42.900
I'm talking about a philosophy. 

22:43.000 --> 22:45.100
Would you mind...
if you excuse me for a minute? 

22:45.100 --> 22:46.100
No! Sure!! 

22:46.100 --> 22:51.800
Where are you and Dan going
for the honeymoon? 

22:52.000 --> 22:54.000
- More lemonade? 
Yeah, thanks! 

22:56.800 --> 22:58.600
You're so tight! 
You're selling next year? 

22:59.100 --> 23:02.100
Abbots Road! It's just round 
the corner from us! 

23:02.400 --> 23:04.300
Geez, that'll be a change, eh? 

23:04.400 --> 23:07.600
Yeah, I'd rather go to a state school,
but, it's mom and dad... 

23:07.600 --> 23:10.700
<i> Jenny, could you come and help 
with sanwiches </ i> </i>

23:11.000 --> 23:12.300
I'll give you a hand too, 
Auntie Cap! 

23:17.900 --> 23:20.400
- What? 
- What are you doing in there? 

23:20.600 --> 23:22.600
Doing a shit. 

23:22.900 --> 23:24.900
No you're not! 

23:28.000 --> 23:29.500
Open the door. 

23:29.500 --> 23:31.400
I can't! 

23:31.600 --> 23:34.800
<i> You greedy fuckup!!</ i> </i>

23:36.400 --> 23:38.400
Rather a selfish 
way to begin a marriage! 

23:39.100 --> 23:41.100
Really! All done!

23:44.000 --> 23:45.000
Dick! 

23:45.000 --> 23:46.900
<i> Obviously, it was a 
big dope weekend! </ i> </i>

23:48.600 --> 23:50.600
You wanna be relaxed at 
your own wedding. </ i> 

23:59.300 --> 24:01.300
-Sorry about that. 
-That's fine! 

24:02.100 --> 24:04.100
So where were we? 

24:04.200 --> 24:04.900
I was saying, you need to get your t... 

24:05.200 --> 24:07.200
-Do you need a seat? 
Yeah, sure! Have a seat!

24:08.000 --> 24:10.000
You need to get your toe in the
the market, Jim! 

24:10.500 --> 24:12.500
You know what I'mn saying? 
Out of suburbs, fine! 

24:13.000 --> 24:15.000
Two bedroom... 

24:14.500 --> 24:16.500
...You don't need a garden 
courtyard, do you?

24:16.900 --> 24:18.900
You want the worst house, 
in the best street! 

24:20.800 --> 24:22.700
You don't need a kitchen or bathroom... 

24:22.700 --> 24:24.200
...Put it in later!

24:24.600 --> 24:26.300
Say for example, 
you want to borrow ... 

24:26.300 --> 24:27.700
...400. 

24:30.900 --> 24:31.900
Or 300... 

24:31.900 --> 24:42.200
You do it... 
You Struggle...

24:42.200 --> 24:44.200
Understand? 

24:43.500 --> 24:45.500
Dan? 

24:46.000 --> 24:48.000
Dan? 

24:48.400 --> 24:50.400
Dan! 

24:50.900 --> 24:52.900
Dan... 

24:53.400 --> 24:55.400
Wake up. 

24:55.500 --> 24:57.500
Dan, Dan, wake up. 

24:59.100 --> 25:01.100
I'm fucked. 

25:01.800 --> 25:03.800
Too much champagne. 

25:04.000 --> 25:06.000
Yeah I'm...
I'm sure it's that... 

25:07.000 --> 25:09.100
Well, it is the big day! 

25:09.100 --> 25:11.100
<i> I'll make some coffee. </ i> </i>

25:10.300 --> 25:12.300
<i> He's drunk! </ i> </i>

25:23.300 --> 25:25.800
<i> Is there anything you 
want to talk to me about?</ i> </i>

25:26.000 --> 25:28.000
<i> What? </ i> </i>

25:28.000 --> 25:29.400
What's going on? 

25:29.400 --> 25:31.000
Mum, you know what's going on! 

25:31.000 --> 25:32.100
We are having a lovely time!

25:32.100 --> 25:34.100
That's not what I meant. 

25:35.100 --> 25:37.100
Well then, I don't know what you mean! 

25:38.600 --> 25:40.300
What's wrong with Dan? 

25:40.300 --> 25:44.000
He's just pissed, Mum!
He's hopeless!! 

25:45.400 --> 25:47.400
Sorry. 

25:47.400 --> 25:49.400
Thanks for the beautiful reception. 

25:53.000 --> 25:56.000
It'd kill your father, you know. 

26:11.400 --> 26:13.400
Think we should stop? 

26:14.900 --> 26:16.900
-What? Now that we're respectable? 
-Yeah, I know!

26:20.100 --> 26:22.100
You know what I mean. 

26:22.800 --> 26:24.800
Whenever you say the word. 

26:32.300 --> 26:34.800
We are the coolest people
in McDonalds!

26:40.400 --> 26:42.400
<i> We had a lot going for us. </ i> </i>

26:44.000 --> 26:48.200
We'd found the secret glue <i> 
that held all things together </ i> </i>

26:50.100 --> 26:52.100
<i> in a perfect place...</ i> </i>

26:52.200 --> 26:54.200
<i> ...where the noise 
did not intrude</ i>. </i>

26:58.000 --> 27:01.900
<i> Our world was...
so very complete. </ i> </i>

27:11.300 --> 27:15.300
Earth

27:23.100 --> 27:25.100
-Hey baby! 
-Hi! 

27:25.400 --> 27:27.400
How was it? 

27:27.400 --> 27:28.900
About the same. 

27:28.900 --> 27:30.700
Here's $200. 

27:30.700 --> 27:32.300
I'm gonna give it half an hour
and then I'll split! 

27:32.300 --> 27:34.200
Yeah. I won't be long.
I'll meet you at home. 

27:34.300 --> 27:35.300
Ok, I see you there. 

27:35.800 --> 27:37.800
OK. 

27:39.500 --> 27:41.900
<i> They say that for every 10 years 
you've been a junkie ...</ i> </i>

27:42.000 --> 27:45.100
<i>  You will have spent 7 of them 
...waiting. </ i> </i>

27:46.800 --> 27:50.400
<i> One way is not bad 
have as much time to think </ i>. </i>

27:51.100 --> 27:54.500
<i> on the other, the anxiety  
 was a full time job!</ i> </i>

28:07.800 --> 28:09.800
- Hey? 
- You slimey cunt! 

28:10.600 --> 28:13.300
- What? 
- What do you fucking reckon? 

28:13.300 --> 28:15.300
I just had a quick little bit! 
It was nothing! 

28:15.600 --> 28:17.100
Where? 

28:17.100 --> 28:18.600
Um, In the park. 
When I met Ange. 

28:18.600 --> 28:20.100
Did Angela do it with you? 

28:20.100 --> 28:22.100
No, of course not! 
We left as soon as we did the deal! 

28:22.800 --> 28:25.400
Only because he's decent enough 
to go home to his girlfriend. 
Like you should be!

28:25.400 --> 28:28.900
Oh candy! He sold me the dope! 
Why would he want to have a hit  
in the public toilet? 

28:29.200 --> 28:31.200
Well why the fuck would you?

28:32.700 --> 28:36.400
Oww!
Look, I admit it was dumb! 

28:36.400 --> 28:38.400
Okay? 

28:38.400 --> 28:39.400
I'm Sorry! 

28:39.400 --> 28:41.400
Will you let me make you a nice taste! 

28:41.400 --> 28:42.400
I'm getting sick of this, dickhead! 

28:42.400 --> 28:43.400
What is your problem? 

28:43.500 --> 28:44.800
You are my problem! 

28:45.000 --> 28:46.400
You are a waste of space. 

28:49.500 --> 28:51.100
Are you getting your period
or something? 

28:51.200 --> 28:52.200
No, Dan. 

28:52.300 --> 28:53.900
I hardly have my period anymore! 

28:54.000 --> 28:55.500
...because my body's 
all fucked up! 

28:55.700 --> 28:57.900
It's this fucking nightmare 
you've led me into! 

28:58.000 --> 29:00.000
Oh right! Like I held a 
gun to your head! Did I? Eh??

29:01.200 --> 29:03.200
Held you down, hit you up, did I?

29:03.800 --> 29:04.800
Fuck You! 

29:05.200 --> 29:06.400
Fuck you too, Candy! 

29:07.100 --> 29:09.100
Well, Fuck you double then! 

29:37.800 --> 29:41.000
Dan, have you noticed, the more 
I work, the less I paint? 

29:42.900 --> 29:45.200
Candy, I don't want a fight! OK?

29:45.900 --> 29:48.200
I just don't see what your problem is tonight! I mean...

29:50.000 --> 29:52.000
We've got a life! 

29:52.000 --> 29:53.900
It's neither good nor bad! OK? 

29:55.700 --> 29:59.600
Do you know... Do you know what I do? 

30:00.900 --> 30:02.800
Listen to this, dick fuck! 

30:02.800 --> 30:04.700
What do I do all day? 

30:04.800 --> 30:06.400
I fuck men I hate! 

30:06.800 --> 30:08.700
-Don't do this. 
-What are going to do about it? 

30:08.800 --> 30:10.400
Look, Okay, that's it! Alright? 

30:10.500 --> 30:12.500
No more brothels, No more escorts!

30:12.500 --> 30:14.500
-We're gonna take the time to 
start a new life! 
-You don't understand do you?

30:14.600 --> 30:16.600
That's really it this time. 
That's going away!

30:16.600 --> 30:18.400
Maybe I want to keep using! 

30:18.400 --> 30:20.400
You know, I'm sick of working, yes, 
but... 

30:20.400 --> 30:22.400
...What if I want to keep using? 
What are you gonna do about it? 

30:22.600 --> 30:23.600
Candy! 

30:24.100 --> 30:25.600
Why don't you ring gay blokes?

30:26.500 --> 30:28.300
You start working! 
You hock your ass! 

30:28.400 --> 30:30.400
Hey, you know you can not do that! 

30:31.400 --> 30:33.400
You know, I'll get...
I'll get AIDS! 

30:33.400 --> 30:35.200
No you won't, you moron!

30:35.300 --> 30:37.400
You'll make them use condoms, 
like everybody else! 

30:37.600 --> 30:39.500
I wouldn't know what to do. 

30:39.500 --> 30:42.800
You're heterosexual, right? So you're
just doing what you're good at anyway. 

30:42.800 --> 30:44.000
Did you even hear what you're saying? 

30:44.100 --> 30:45.000
Let me fuck women, no problems! 

30:45.000 --> 30:49.400
If I can do it with women, I'd make us all the money! You'd never have to work, I swear!

30:49.400 --> 30:51.400
But... These women, they want 
muscle types, don't they? 

30:52.700 --> 30:55.100
If there was a market out there, I'd 
do it, but I don't think there is!

30:55.100 --> 30:56.500
And I'd be hopeless with the gay stuff! 
You know that!

30:57.200 --> 30:58.400
You're fucking unbeleivable!

31:15.100 --> 31:17.100
I can't get to sleep with that on. 

31:17.400 --> 31:19.400
Can you turn it off? 

31:19.800 --> 31:21.800
Candy, it's a really good movie! 

31:22.500 --> 31:24.500
I'll turn it down, okay? 

31:30.000 --> 31:34.000
Anyway, it finishes in half an hour. 

31:35.500 --> 31:36.500
Fuck you! 

31:37.500 --> 31:39.500
Go to bed. 

31:41.000 --> 31:43.000
How can you even hear that? 

31:43.000 --> 31:44.600
The light's bugging me! 

31:58.200 --> 32:00.200
<i> I can't believe it. </ i> </i>

32:00.200 --> 32:01.800
<i> I can't fucking believe it. </ i> </i>

32:02.300 --> 32:04.300
What? I'm not making any noise. 

32:05.200 --> 32:07.200
The light! 

32:07.600 --> 32:09.600
The Light's keeping me awake. 

32:09.700 --> 32:11.700
OK, look! I'll cover the light! 
Hmm??

32:13.900 --> 32:16.800
There's more light coming from the 
workshop than that!

32:16.900 --> 32:18.900
<i> Asshole! </ i> </i>

32:25.200 --> 32:28.200
<i>The pen!! I can hear the pen 
scratching on the paper! </ i>. </i>

32:28.600 --> 32:30.600
How? This is ridiculous, Candy. 

32:30.600 --> 32:33.100
You're just looking for an excuse! 

32:33.700 --> 32:35.500
Turn off the light and come to bed. 

32:35.500 --> 32:37.300
I'm not going to discuss this with you anymore! 

32:37.300 --> 32:38.500
Turn the light off! 

32:38.500 --> 32:40.000
Nope! I'm not even talking to you! 

32:40.000 --> 32:41.400
-TURN THE FUCKING LIGHT OFF!! 
-...Aghhh!

32:43.000 --> 32:45.000
FUCK!! 

32:45.000 --> 32:46.000
Oh my God! Oh my God! 

32:46.000 --> 32:48.100
-Shit. 
-I'm so sorry, Danny! 

32:48.200 --> 32:50.900
-What the fuck was that? 
-Oh my God! Oh baby! Oh shit!

32:52.500 --> 32:53.500
Jesus! It's fuckin' blood! 

32:53.600 --> 32:54.600
I didn't mean to hurt you... 

32:58.500 --> 33:00.500
Jesus fuckin' shit, alright!. 
Fuck!

33:01.000 --> 33:03.400
Is there any chance for some morphine? 

33:04.800 --> 33:06.800
I'm in a fair bit of pain. 

33:09.700 --> 33:11.400
I don't think you need any morphine. 

33:11.700 --> 33:13.300
I don't think you're in 
much pain at all! 

33:14.200 --> 33:16.200
Oh well, it was worth a try! 

33:23.900 --> 33:27.300
Excuse me, would you mind if we um, 
bought a couple of flavoured milks off you? 

33:27.900 --> 33:29.900
-Just take a couple. 
-You sure? 

33:29.900 --> 33:31.100
No worries!

33:31.100 --> 33:32.200
-Want some of this? 
-Yeah!

33:32.200 --> 33:35.800
-Have a good night! 
-Thanks. 
-Thankyou!

33:51.300 --> 33:53.300
D'you want anymore? 

34:08.199 --> 34:10.199
It's been a while. 

34:12.199 --> 34:14.199
Yeah! It's been a while. 

34:21.900 --> 34:23.900
I'm sorry I hurt your head. 

34:27.100 --> 34:29.100
I'll get you back! 

34:51.600 --> 34:56.600
Hello.... 
Anybody home? 

34:57.300 --> 34:59.300
Who the fuck are you? 

34:59.300 --> 35:01.000
Yeah, it's me! 
Phil. 

35:01.100 --> 35:03.100
Phillip Dudley, 
from Commercial Realty. 

35:03.600 --> 35:05.600
I've written to you lately. 

35:06.000 --> 35:12.500
-What's the problem? 
-Well...

35:12.500 --> 35:18.600
We've been writing to you about... 
Um... 

35:18.600 --> 35:23.300
I've got these... 
er... hang on...
Er, here they are!

35:23.300 --> 35:26.800
Copies of the three letters 
we've sent you recently... 

35:27.400 --> 35:30.700
Relating to the matter of your er,
rent in arrears. 

35:33.200 --> 35:38.600
I'm here to confirm that the 3rd of 
these letters is in actual fact a 
notice to vacate. 

35:39.200 --> 35:41.200
Effective 7 days hence. 

35:41.700 --> 35:42.500
Fuck! 

35:43.700 --> 35:47.800
Well of course it was...
28 days when you received the letter. 

35:49.300 --> 35:52.300
Now, what I'm actually here for today... 

35:52.300 --> 35:55.800
is to point out to you the 
shortfall owing on the fault 
of your bond. 

35:55.800 --> 36:00.000
Assuming... you've paid no more rent between now and next wednesday... 

36:00.000 --> 36:04.300
We've calculated that the shortfall 
will be er... $1,125. 

36:05.100 --> 36:07.100
Listen, Phillip... 

36:07.300 --> 36:09.300
...we're junkies!

36:09.400 --> 36:11.400
I am a hooker! 

36:11.500 --> 36:13.500
He's hopeless! 

36:14.400 --> 36:18.700
Right now, things are very complicated! 
We haven't got any money. 

36:24.000 --> 36:26.000
Right. 

36:27.500 --> 36:29.000
<i> But it was good...</ i> </i>

36:29.700 --> 36:31.300
<i> Right when times got tough...</ i> </i>

36:31.400 --> 36:32.900
<i>There was always Casper. </ i>. </i>

36:34.300 --> 36:35.800
Ah, the young ones! 

36:35.900 --> 36:36.900
Hi! 

36:37.100 --> 36:39.100
<i>Our... port in the storm! </ i>. </i>

36:39.200 --> 36:41.200
Don't get overexcited! 

36:41.400 --> 36:43.400
<i> ...our gingerbread house! </ i> </i>

36:43.400 --> 36:50.100
For once... Here I come...
Bearing Treats! 

37:01.100 --> 37:03.100
So is this it? 

37:03.200 --> 37:05.600
An honour student didn't show, 
so I had an idle hour to fill. 

37:06.300 --> 37:08.300
You made that in an hour? 

37:08.300 --> 37:11.900
Well... Panadine to morphine, 
in about an hour and 10! 

37:12.800 --> 37:15.000
If you get rid of the paracetamol... 

37:15.600 --> 37:17.100
...do a few things... 

37:18.600 --> 37:21.200
...and morphine to heroin in 15 minutes. 

37:24.000 --> 37:25.500
Thankyou, you guys!

37:26.000 --> 37:27.300
Rearrange the atoms... 

37:28.500 --> 37:29.500
...take a bit off... 

37:30.600 --> 37:31.500
...put a bit on... 

37:32.400 --> 37:34.000
Liquid Diamorphine... 

37:34.100 --> 37:38.200
Commonly known as heroin, 
pharmaceutical grade, pure. 

37:38.400 --> 37:40.400
I call it "My Yellow Jesus!" 

37:42.200 --> 37:44.200
Papa bear. 

37:44.200 --> 37:46.000
Mama bear. 

37:47.100 --> 37:49.100
Baby bear. 

38:31.600 --> 38:36.400
<i>It's just that... Candy says I 
have to start pulling my weight! </ i></i>

38:38.400 --> 38:40.400
Yeah. 

38:45.500 --> 38:48.200
What do you know about gay escorts? 

38:49.300 --> 38:51.300
Growth market. 

38:54.300 --> 38:57.500
Would you mind if asked you a few
technical questions? 

39:00.600 --> 39:03.300
There's nothing I'd rather 
discuss with you! 

39:06.000 --> 39:08.400
What do they expect you to do? 

39:09.000 --> 39:10.900
Well there's a big down in the park! 

39:10.900 --> 39:14.300
Why don't you pop down 
and do some research!

39:15.200 --> 39:16.800
I mean... 

39:16.800 --> 39:23.200
If they pay you, would they 
expect you to have a stiffie? 

39:25.800 --> 39:27.800
It Helps! 

39:30.700 --> 39:33.800
I don't think I could manage that. 

40:12.500 --> 40:14.500
I'm just washing my hands. 

40:37.500 --> 40:38.500
Alright! 

40:38.600 --> 40:40.300
He'll cancel his cards. 

40:40.400 --> 40:41.900
Not if I get to him first. 

40:45.000 --> 40:49.400
M. Ro. Roger. Rog. Rogie baby!
Roger, Donald. 

40:49.400 --> 40:51.400
R.D. Here it is! 

40:52.400 --> 40:55.700
R.D. Moylan, 
48 Charles Street, Petersham. 

40:55.800 --> 40:57.800
He'll trace the call. 

40:57.800 --> 41:00.100
That's why they invented 
prepaid phones. 

41:01.200 --> 41:03.200
Ah, Hi! Roger? 

41:04.000 --> 41:06.000
Is that Roger Moylan? 

41:06.000 --> 41:10.400
Yeah, Look! Look, This is hard... 

41:10.400 --> 41:13.900
I'm the guy who stole your wallet. 

41:14.800 --> 41:17.000
Yep! No, hold on! I'm sorry, okay?
That's why I'm calling! I'm really sorry! 

41:17.100 --> 41:21.200
I just... I was after some money, 
I saw some cash... and you had none... 

41:21.300 --> 41:23.200
I want to give your wallet back! 

41:23.200 --> 41:27.600
No, I know! I feel so stupid! 
It's just that I'm... 

41:27.600 --> 41:30.600
I'm so lonely right now... 

41:30.600 --> 41:33.100
I've got no money, 
I've just come from Adelaide...

41:33.100 --> 41:34.700
And I've got no friends... 

41:35.800 --> 41:37.900
You know, I saw the wallet on the seat, and I took it! I wasn't thinking! 

41:37.900 --> 41:39.800
And I'm not interested in your
credit cards. 

41:39.800 --> 41:42.500
I just want to do the right thing 
and give it back to you. 

41:44.200 --> 41:46.000
Uhh...  Well, no! I mean now's not a good time, I... 

41:46.000 --> 41:48.600
I'm a little bit nervous about 
this whole thing anyway! 

41:48.600 --> 41:51.300
Can we just... 
Let's meet in the morning! 

41:51.500 --> 41:53.300
What... 
What time do you go to work?

41:54.900 --> 41:56.900
So you're in Petersham, right? 

41:56.900 --> 42:00.400
Umm... Isn't there a footie oval down
there or something? 

42:01.300 --> 42:03.700
How about we meet out in front of 
the greyhound stand? 

42:04.700 --> 42:06.000
9:30? Is that good? 

42:08.000 --> 42:10.300
Well I'll be wearing a 
blue baseball cap! 

42:10.300 --> 42:14.500
Look! look, Take my number! 

42:15.000 --> 42:17.000
You got a pen? 
Yep, Right...

42:24.300 --> 42:26.300
Yes, 881. 

42:26.300 --> 42:30.800
Well, have you got...
a mobile just in case there's a... 

42:30.800 --> 42:35.700
Yeah... Yeah! 
Hey, Tell me one thing... 

42:35.800 --> 42:39.100
How did you manage to get such a 
cute photo on your license?

42:39.100 --> 42:42.400
I'm Sorry! Yeah, I'm sorry, 
I go too far!

42:44.800 --> 42:46.800
Alright! 9:30 then! 
I'll see you then! 

42:48.300 --> 42:50.600
Alright, Thanks Rog! 
Okay, bye! 

42:52.600 --> 42:56.500
Imagine if you'd turned your powers 
to the benefit of mankind... Dan!

42:57.300 --> 42:59.300
Does this look like me? 

42:59.800 --> 43:01.800
Not even remotely. 

43:03.000 --> 43:05.000
I could use these! 

43:07.500 --> 43:09.500
And a bit of... 

43:10.000 --> 43:12.000
...How about now? 

43:13.800 --> 43:15.800
Caucasian man with glasses. 

43:17.000 --> 43:18.500
Yes! 

43:23.300 --> 43:26.300
I felt like Tarzan, 
at fuckin' last! 

43:26.300 --> 43:29.100
I had to hunt down some 
food for Jane. 

43:30.000 --> 43:32.900
I knew it was in my power 
to do something brave. 

44:22.600 --> 44:24.600
Yeah... 

44:24.600 --> 44:26.600
Can we talk about this 
when you get back to the office? 

44:26.600 --> 44:28.800
20 minutes... Okay, bye!

44:28.800 --> 44:30.700
Sorry about that! 

44:30.700 --> 44:32.000
Good morning, 
How are you? 

44:32.000 --> 44:33.600
Ah, good! 
How are you?

44:33.600 --> 44:35.200
Good. 

44:35.200 --> 44:37.700
I just uh, wanted to check my 
current balance on this please! 

44:37.700 --> 44:40.300
Okay, I'll just need to get you to
enter in your PIN... 

44:43.300 --> 44:45.300
Oh God, I'm... 
terrible with this! 

44:45.300 --> 44:49.200
God! Do you ever have trouble 
remembering your PIN? 

44:49.700 --> 44:52.900
You'd be surprised at the number of 
people who forget them. 

44:52.900 --> 44:55.400
Yeah I know! 
That's why I came inside... 

44:55.400 --> 44:57.300
Because I couldn't remember it 
out at the ATM, and I thought... 

44:57.300 --> 45:00.000
You know I could just er.. 
If I had ID? 

45:00.000 --> 45:04.900
No! I'm sorry, you need your PIN 
number for all transactions. It's...

45:04.900 --> 45:06.600
It's one of those security things! 

45:06.600 --> 45:08.700
No! Of course, of course! 
I understand. Um...

45:09.900 --> 45:11.900
So you can't just... 

45:12.300 --> 45:13.500
I really can't!

45:17.800 --> 45:19.300
Hello? 

45:19.300 --> 45:21.300
-Mr. Moylan?
-Yes?

45:21.500 --> 45:23.500
-Mr. Roger Moylan? 
-Yes?

45:23.500 --> 45:28.300
Roger Moylan, This is Ewan Douglas 
from the Commonwealth Bank 
Security division... 

45:28.300 --> 45:31.200
Yes? Is something the matter?

45:31.400 --> 45:36.300
We've been tracking some unusual 
activity on your credit card, in   
the last 24 hours...

45:36.300 --> 45:37.300
Oh no! 

45:37.300 --> 45:39.800
When was the last time 
you used your Master Card? 

45:39.800 --> 45:44.000
Um, look! I think my wallet was 
stolen last night... 

45:44.000 --> 45:46.600
Did you report it missing? 

45:47.800 --> 45:49.800
I was just calling now!

45:49.800 --> 45:51.300
<i> But I called you. </ i> </i>

45:51.300 --> 45:53.000
Um, I mean I was about to call. 

45:53.600 --> 45:58.400
Sir, Mr. Moylan, I'm going to have to 
verify your details for a security check. 

45:58.400 --> 46:00.500
Would you please tell me your 
Date of Birth?

46:00.500 --> 46:03.400
Um... 13th of March, 1977. 

46:03.400 --> 46:05.800
Mother's Maiden Name? 

46:05.800 --> 46:07.700
Er, Lynch. 

46:07.900 --> 46:09.200
Number of security? 

46:09.200 --> 46:13.200
Is that like your PIN number? 

46:13.200 --> 46:17.400
Well, it shouldn't be... 
but you often find that it is! 

46:17.400 --> 46:23.000
Umm...
Try... 3279 

46:38.800 --> 46:42.300
It's just one of those days, you know... where everythings just gone! 

46:42.300 --> 46:44.500
It happens all the time! 

46:44.500 --> 46:47.500
Um, but listen... I've already got my daily limit out from the ATM outside... 

46:47.500 --> 46:51.500
...But I actually need more, because 
I'm trying to buy this beautiful old Mercedes....

46:51.500 --> 46:53.100
...you know, the cream ones, 
you know, the TLS? 

46:53.100 --> 46:55.500
Anyway, the guy's willing to negotiate for cash... 

47:02.200 --> 47:04.200
...$2247. 

47:04.800 --> 47:06.800
God, we're going to be 
in the poor house! 

47:07.000 --> 47:09.000
...and 50 cents.

47:09.400 --> 47:11.800
Never get sentimental about a car! 

47:16.200 --> 47:19.600
I might just get you to check the 
available credit on this card...

47:21.000 --> 47:23.000
I can get a cash advance, can't I? 

47:25.900 --> 47:27.900
Candy? Candy! 

47:27.900 --> 47:29.900
I did it! I did it! 
I fucking did it, baby! 

47:31.600 --> 47:33.600
I fucking did it! 

47:33.600 --> 47:36.400

47:36.400 --> 47:38.200

47:38.400 --> 47:40.500
Oh god! You should have seen it! 
I was fucking great! It was like...

47:41.000 --> 47:43.000
It was like that movie 
we saw with that...

47:43.000 --> 47:46.700
God, what was his name, 
that actor we like?

47:46.700 --> 47:48.400
...and he gets all that money,  
and he walks in and he's all coool, 
and stuf like that... 
-Danny!

47:48.400 --> 47:56.400
I'm pregnant. 

47:57.600 --> 47:59.600
Shit. 

48:12.000 --> 48:14.000
Candy. 

48:14.100 --> 48:16.100
Crap. 

48:18.000 --> 48:19.300
It couldn't be, uh... 

48:23.900 --> 48:24.900
No. 

48:25.200 --> 48:27.200
We never broke a condom. 

48:28.300 --> 48:30.300
I'd know. 

48:30.900 --> 48:32.900
It was the night 
I broke your skull. 

48:35.200 --> 48:37.200
How fucking weird. 

48:37.600 --> 48:39.600
One night. 

48:43.200 --> 48:45.200
I can get an abortion. 

48:46.800 --> 48:48.000
No. 

48:48.400 --> 48:50.400
No, no way! 

48:50.700 --> 48:52.700
This is good. 

48:53.200 --> 48:55.200
It was meant to be. 

48:55.900 --> 48:57.900
This is what we need. 

49:00.000 --> 49:02.000
We've got to stop using. 

49:06.400 --> 49:07.600
Yeah. 

49:10.000 --> 49:11.200
Yeah, of course. 

49:19.400 --> 49:20.600
Sugar? 

49:22.000 --> 49:23.200
Two, please. 

49:25.600 --> 49:27.600
We've got some news everybody... 

49:30.300 --> 49:32.600
We're having a baby. 

49:32.600 --> 49:41.500
Ah, Darling! 

50:22.500 --> 50:24.500
Candice, Good God. 

50:30.400 --> 50:34.400
We just wanted you to know that 
we've made some decisions. and uh... 

50:35.100 --> 50:37.100
We've been putting some money aside,
haven't we? 

50:37.800 --> 50:40.000
We're going to get out of that 
whole warehouse environment. 

50:40.300 --> 50:42.100
...and live in a proper house. 

50:42.400 --> 50:44.300
Yeah! We really want to raise 
our child in the.... 

50:45.100 --> 50:47.500
...in a proper home. 

50:48.400 --> 50:50.400
Have you told your parents? 

50:52.500 --> 50:54.000
No. 

50:57.300 --> 50:59.300
Day 1 

51:02.900 --> 51:04.900
We knew what we had 
to do. 

51:06.300 --> 51:09.100
It takes alot of planning to stop. 

51:13.700 --> 51:15.700
Lucky at last! 
We can really do this, Candy. 

51:17.300 --> 51:19.300
It's going to be hard, but... 

51:21.400 --> 51:23.400
I'm sure it's like a bridge... 

51:24.500 --> 51:26.900
And once we cross it, 
everything will be okay. 

51:28.700 --> 51:30.700
You can get back into your 
painting again...

51:31.100 --> 51:33.100
Maybe we'll move to the country... 

51:33.300 --> 51:35.300
Grow some veggies... 

51:35.300 --> 51:36.700
Feed the chickens... 

51:39.100 --> 51:41.100
We could go live in Thailand...

51:46.100 --> 51:48.800
Thailand would be great, 
if we didn't use. 

51:49.800 --> 51:51.800
Or the Himalayas. 

51:53.500 --> 51:55.500
We'll go canoeing... 

51:55.600 --> 51:57.600
A bit of white water rafting... 

52:02.100 --> 52:05.500
Get healthy, sleep well... 

52:06.100 --> 52:08.600
...not have drugs in our system. 

52:10.400 --> 52:12.400
How good would that be? 

52:17.800 --> 52:19.800
We really have to do this. 

52:21.900 --> 52:23.900
We have to do it this time. 

52:24.300 --> 52:26.300
Yeah, we will. 

52:27.300 --> 52:29.300
We are. 

52:30.700 --> 52:32.700
We're really fuckin' doing it! 

53:35.400 --> 53:37.400
Day 2 

56:44.900 --> 56:46.900
Day 4 

56:54.300 --> 56:56.300
I can't do it. 

56:56.900 --> 56:58.900
I can't do it. 

56:58.900 --> 57:01.200
Hey! 
Come back to bed. 

57:01.400 --> 57:03.400
Alright? You'll catch a cold. 

57:29.400 --> 57:31.400
Casper, It's Candy. 

57:31.400 --> 57:33.100
Ring me as soon as you get this. 

57:33.300 --> 57:35.300
We've tried your mobile. 

57:38.100 --> 57:41.100
I know we said to ignore us while
we did this, but... 

57:41.100 --> 57:42.600
3 days... 

57:45.200 --> 57:47.400
...we did pretty well, but 
we're not feeling so great now. 

57:47.400 --> 57:49.800
We don't want you to ignore us now. 

57:51.600 --> 57:53.600
Are you there? 

57:55.100 --> 57:57.100
Pick up if you're there. 

57:58.200 --> 58:00.200
Pick up! 

58:02.900 --> 58:04.900
Okay, you're not there.

58:04.900 --> 58:06.500
Call us!! 

58:06.500 --> 58:07.700
Shit! Shit! 

58:08.700 --> 58:09.700
Shit! Shit! Shit! 

58:15.500 --> 58:17.500
Kojak? It's Candy! 

58:21.100 --> 58:22.400
Um... Shit, not so good. 

58:24.500 --> 58:25.500
I'm really sick. I mean... 

58:25.500 --> 58:27.600
We just need credit. 

58:28.100 --> 58:30.200
Uh... I can work a shift, 
and then I can pay you back. 

58:31.900 --> 58:34.800
Yeah, well if I work a shift, 
then I can pay that too. 

58:36.900 --> 58:38.800
I can't work when I'm this sick! 

58:40.500 --> 58:42.500
Ok, bye. 

58:42.800 --> 58:44.800
Fucking cunt!! 

58:46.200 --> 58:48.200
Candy. 

58:49.500 --> 58:53.600
-Candy. 
-Oh God!

58:53.600 --> 58:55.600
Answer!
Answer, please! 

58:59.600 --> 59:02.100
He was just about to answer!

59:02.400 --> 59:10.300
-Give me the phone. 
-I want the fucking phone!

59:10.300 --> 59:11.300
Don't fucking take it away from me! 
No! No!!

59:12.700 --> 59:18.900
-We can do it. 
-No! Get away!! Nooooo!!

59:18.900 --> 59:20.900
Candy, you're bleeding. 

59:21.100 --> 59:22.600
Candy, you're bleeding. 

59:22.700 --> 59:24.700
Why are you bleeding? 

59:30.300 --> 59:33.600
The water has broken.
Her cervix has dilated. 

59:34.300 --> 59:36.100
This is what we didn't 
want to happen. 

59:36.800 --> 59:39.200
We call this an 
inevitable miscarriage. 

59:39.200 --> 59:40.200
There's no going back. 

59:40.800 --> 59:45.100
As I was explaining to Candy, 
she's going to have to go through 
a kind of... labour! 

59:45.700 --> 59:49.500
I don't know however long that takes, you need to know that at this state of
the pregnancy... 

59:49.500 --> 59:51.200
...the baby is not going to survive. 

59:52.500 --> 59:54.000
I'm Sorry. 

01:00:34.200 --> 01:00:36.200
Give me pethidine! 

01:00:36.200 --> 01:00:37.700
I want pethidine! 

01:00:37.900 --> 01:00:39.800
Will you give her the fucking 
pethidine, or what? 

01:00:40.200 --> 01:00:42.200
She's fucking in pain, 
can't you see this?

01:00:55.800 --> 01:00:57.800
That's it! Candy, push! 

01:00:59.200 --> 01:01:01.200
Almost there! 
Push! 
That's it!!

01:01:23.500 --> 01:01:25.500
Can I hold it? 

01:01:41.400 --> 01:01:43.500
Doctor, it's leg moved. 

01:01:43.900 --> 01:01:44.900
It's just a spasm. 

01:01:44.900 --> 01:01:45.700
It moved! 

01:01:45.700 --> 01:01:47.700
It's just a spasm. 

01:02:50.300 --> 01:02:52.800
Hell 

01:03:35.900 --> 01:03:37.900
-How much did you get? 
-50. 

01:03:39.800 --> 01:03:41.800
That guy is still back there. 

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:44.600
-Maybe you'll sell some. Yeah?
-Alright. 

01:03:49.200 --> 01:03:51.200
<i>Everything we ever did...</ i> </i>

01:03:51.700 --> 01:03:53.700
<i> we did with the best 
of intentions... </ i> </i>

01:03:54.100 --> 01:03:58.300
<i> But.. events tumble!
and the years pile up.</ i> </i>

01:03:58.400 --> 01:04:02.700
<i> The world is very bewildering 
to a junkie. </ i> </i>

01:04:05.800 --> 01:04:07.800
Yeah, we're all good!

01:04:15.600 --> 01:04:22.100
-Well... Tastes bad. 
-Fuck!

01:04:22.100 --> 01:04:24.100
Here you go. 

01:04:26.400 --> 01:04:28.400
Do you feel anything? 

01:04:29.100 --> 01:04:30.600
No. 

01:04:34.400 --> 01:04:36.400
-Shit! 
-Shit!

01:04:41.500 --> 01:04:45.900
<i> and still... you cling to
 the concept of change. </ i> </i>

01:04:55.200 --> 01:04:57.200
Hey, Schumann... 

01:04:57.200 --> 01:04:59.500
...we are thinking of moving 
up the country for a while. 

01:04:59.500 --> 01:05:01.200
Give methadone a try. 

01:05:03.600 --> 01:05:05.600
What the fuck difference 
would it make? 

01:05:13.600 --> 01:05:16.400
The air's cleaner, for one. 

01:06:11.200 --> 01:06:13.200
It's a kitchen. 

01:06:20.100 --> 01:06:22.100
It's a bit dark, isn't it?

01:06:22.100 --> 01:06:23.100
Yeah. 

01:06:24.100 --> 01:06:26.100
Yeah, we Could um... 

01:06:26.100 --> 01:06:31.100
knock out a hole...
and put a skylight. 

01:06:48.500 --> 01:06:50.000
I love you. 

01:07:23.100 --> 01:07:25.100
Any frozen peas? 

01:07:25.600 --> 01:07:27.100
No. 

01:07:29.900 --> 01:07:31.000
I got one!
There he is! 

01:07:31.700 --> 01:07:33.700
It was all the way down 
in the turbo frost.

01:07:41.900 --> 01:07:43.900
I can not believe you didn't do 
this, this morning. 

01:07:44.200 --> 01:07:46.200
What time are they coming? 

01:07:46.200 --> 01:07:47.900
Fuck!! 

01:08:03.100 --> 01:08:04.600
What's the date? 

01:08:04.600 --> 01:08:07.000
Oh no, this expired a month ago. 

01:08:10.900 --> 01:08:12.400
Look at that! It smells bad!

01:08:12.900 --> 01:08:14.900
-That's got that kind of chicken smell!
-Yeah it does doesn't it!

01:08:16.100 --> 01:08:20.899
Not to worry, we'll just 
baste it in lots of stuff!
Like uh... 

01:08:20.899 --> 01:08:22.899
Basil, uh... honey?
Bayleaves or something?

01:08:23.300 --> 01:08:25.300
What's in the cupboard?

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:28.000
What do you put on a roast? 

01:08:33.100 --> 01:08:35.800
How long did it take you to 
get out here? 

01:08:36.300 --> 01:08:38.300
Oh, About an hour and 40 minutes? 
Dear?

01:08:42.600 --> 01:08:44.600
Yeah, about... 40? 45? 

01:08:47.700 --> 01:08:49.200
Much traffic? 

01:08:49.300 --> 01:08:51.300
No, pretty good run really. 

01:08:51.600 --> 01:08:53.600
Can't complain. 

01:08:55.700 --> 01:08:58.300
It's so beautiful here, 
the drive down was so beautiful.

01:08:58.300 --> 01:09:01.500
Yeah, it's... 
Countryside. 

01:09:05.700 --> 01:09:07.700
Had any news on the job front? 

01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:13.700
Um... Well it's pretty... 
There's not much work around here. 
We're getting by on the dole.

01:09:14.200 --> 01:09:17.100
Well, apparently I might be able to 
get some work hay bailing. 

01:09:17.700 --> 01:09:19.700
Hay bailing? 

01:09:20.300 --> 01:09:22.300
-Ooooh! Tough work, hay bailing! 
-Yeah.

01:09:26.300 --> 01:09:28.200
So! What can I do in the kitchen? 

01:09:28.300 --> 01:09:30.200
Nothing mum, really! 
It's fine!

01:09:30.200 --> 01:09:31.800
Nonsense, there must be something 
I can do to help. 

01:09:32.100 --> 01:09:33.600
Everything's under control. 

01:09:33.899 --> 01:09:35.399
The oven's heating up. 

01:09:38.100 --> 01:09:39.899
We're running a bit behind.

01:09:40.500 --> 01:09:41.500
<i> No worries, mate. </ i> </i>

01:09:43.100 --> 01:09:46.100
Oh This is unbelievable. 
You go to all this trouble 
to invite us up here... 

01:09:46.100 --> 01:09:49.399
...and you can't even manage the 
simple decency of getting the meal 
together on time!

01:09:49.600 --> 01:09:51.000
Get off my case, mum! 

01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:52.300
Is not food that's even the issue here.

01:09:52.300 --> 01:09:53.600
It's your attitude! 

01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:56.100
Okay, let's just calm down. 
Lunch will be ready in less than an hour. 

01:09:56.100 --> 01:09:57.100
Who wants some wine? 

01:09:58.800 --> 01:10:00.600
That chicken is rock solid! 

01:10:00.600 --> 01:10:03.000
We're not going to be eating before 
midnight. 

01:10:03.100 --> 01:10:04.300
And where are the vegetables? 

01:10:04.300 --> 01:10:05.300
Hey hey, Let's all calm down, honey. 

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:08.000
What do you think is about? 

01:10:08.600 --> 01:10:11.500
Sunday Lunch. 
It's a pretty simple thing. 

01:10:12.200 --> 01:10:14.300
But with you two, there's no 
such thing as simple. 

01:10:14.600 --> 01:10:15.600
The drugs! 

01:10:16.200 --> 01:10:18.600
The drugs always come first. 

01:10:18.900 --> 01:10:20.600
Hey no, that is not true. 

01:10:20.700 --> 01:10:22.800
We're doing really well now. 

01:10:24.500 --> 01:10:26.500
Do you have any idea... 

01:10:28.300 --> 01:10:31.600
...what you have done to my family? 

01:10:32.900 --> 01:10:34.900
To me? 

01:10:36.300 --> 01:10:39.300
What happened to that beautiful girl? 

01:10:39.800 --> 01:10:41.800
What happened? 

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:44.000
What happened? 

01:10:44.600 --> 01:10:46.600
Can't you see? 

01:10:47.600 --> 01:10:49.600
Don't you understand? 

01:10:50.100 --> 01:10:55.100
I have been clutching my fucking fists
since I was 6 years old. 

01:10:56.100 --> 01:10:58.100
Look at my fucking fists!
Look at them! 

01:11:00.500 --> 01:11:02.500
Look at them, you fucking bitch! 

01:11:02.900 --> 01:11:04.900
Don't you understand? 

01:11:05.900 --> 01:11:08.800
No! I gotta clench my hands!

01:11:11.100 --> 01:11:12.400
I gotta clench my hands! 
I can't relax. 

01:11:15.300 --> 01:11:18.700
Darling, darling! Look!
It's been a big move. 

01:11:18.700 --> 01:11:19.700
It's been a big year. 

01:11:20.300 --> 01:11:21.500
There's been lots of changes. 

01:11:22.600 --> 01:11:24.400
C'mon, you've lost a child.

01:11:24.400 --> 01:11:27.300
But you ARE getting your lives together. 
I can see that!

01:11:28.800 --> 01:11:30.100
Just go. 

01:11:31.100 --> 01:11:32.300
Fuck off. 

01:11:33.500 --> 01:11:35.100
Forget lunch. 

01:11:38.300 --> 01:11:40.300
Can we? 

01:11:40.800 --> 01:11:42.800
Can we cancel the lunch? 

01:11:43.500 --> 01:11:45.500
Maybe we can just make 
this another day. 

01:11:46.600 --> 01:11:49.600
Today is just a bad day. 
I'm sorry. 

01:11:59.900 --> 01:12:01.900
I'm scared. 

01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:07.000
There's nothing to be scared of. 

01:12:11.600 --> 01:12:13.600
There's nothing to be scared of. 

01:12:19.500 --> 01:12:21.500
D'you think we're going to end? 

01:12:24.100 --> 01:12:26.100
-We'll never end. 
-It'll end.

01:12:34.200 --> 01:12:36.200
It's not gonna work. 

01:12:51.600 --> 01:12:53.600
Is that the flu vaccine? 

01:12:53.600 --> 01:12:55.600
It's medicine. 

01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:59.000
It's leading us not into temptation. 

01:13:03.800 --> 01:13:05.800
Hey Candy, check out this. 

01:13:05.800 --> 01:13:07.700
Brickie's labourer.

01:13:08.100 --> 01:13:10.100
-I'll give it a call, eh. 
-Why don't you do that. 

01:14:10.400 --> 01:14:12.400
-Hi. 
-Hey!

01:14:18.900 --> 01:14:20.900
This is Paul. 
He lives up the road. 

01:14:23.900 --> 01:14:25.900
Good day. 

01:14:26.200 --> 01:14:28.200
He's got some good home grow. 

01:14:28.200 --> 01:14:30.200
Great. 
Can I get some more? 

01:14:32.700 --> 01:14:34.700
Um... There is none left. 

01:14:41.400 --> 01:14:43.400
Then I'll grab a beer. 

01:14:43.400 --> 01:14:45.000
There's none of that either. 

01:14:50.500 --> 01:14:52.500
I'm gonna go and get some more pot. 

01:14:53.800 --> 01:14:55.800
Uh.. We gonna grab some dinner, 
or What? 

01:14:55.800 --> 01:14:57.500
No, you eat! I'll be fine. 

01:14:59.100 --> 01:15:01.100
You want some money? 
I got paid. 

01:15:01.100 --> 01:15:02.800
-No. 
-No, it's okay mate. 

01:16:02.800 --> 01:16:04.800
Where were you? 

01:16:05.100 --> 01:16:07.100
Don't you fuck this one with 
your negative comments. 

01:16:09.800 --> 01:16:11.800
What are you doing? 

01:16:11.800 --> 01:16:13.600
Going back to my art. 

01:16:13.600 --> 01:16:15.700
Does not mean anything to you? 

01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:18.000
Have you been fuckingt that guy? 

01:16:20.500 --> 01:16:22.500
You do not know what 
you're talking about. 

01:16:22.500 --> 01:16:24.500
Where have you been all night? 

01:16:24.600 --> 01:16:26.300
Away from you. 

01:16:28.200 --> 01:16:30.200
You fucked him, didn't you? 

01:16:34.700 --> 01:16:36.700
Firstly... 

01:16:37.400 --> 01:16:39.400
...You do not know what 
you're talking about. 

01:16:40.600 --> 01:16:42.600
Secondly... 

01:16:41.900 --> 01:16:43.900
...I hate the sound of your voice. 

01:16:45.300 --> 01:16:46.300
Thirdly... 

01:16:47.300 --> 01:16:48.800
...Why don't you just fuck off? 

01:16:52.200 --> 01:16:54.200
I mean, really! 

01:16:55.500 --> 01:16:57.500
Fuck off! 

01:17:19.900 --> 01:17:22.700
Wakey wakey. 
Hands off snakey!

01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:27.000
What the fuck is that? 

01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:29.200
A statement of fact. 
What do you think it is?

our joy. </ i> </i>

01:20:44.900 --> 01:20:46.900
<i>I was wet thighed  
with the surrender... </ i> </i>

01:20:48.200 --> 01:20:50.200
<i>Then there was a gap in things... </ i> </i>

01:20:50.800 --> 01:20:52.800

01:27:04.300 --> 01:27:06.300
Candy. 

01:27:08.100 --> 01:27:10.100
You okay?

01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:35.000
Sorry. 

01:27:37.300 --> 01:27:39.300

Candy? 

01:27:54.100 --> 01:27:56.100
Everything's dead.

Everything's turning blue. 

01:28:30.400 --> 01:28:32.400
It's hard through all this you know. 

01:28:37.500 --> 01:28:40.700

<i> The world was full of 
startling new concepts. </ i> </i>

<i> I couldn't think. 
I couldn't breathe. </ I> </i>

01:32:04.300 --> 01:32:06.300
<i>I was waiting for her 
to come back. </ i> </i>

01:32:07.300 --> 01:32:09.300
<i> Because she was everything. </ i> </i>

01:32:11.200 --> 01:32:13.200
<i> She was everything to me. </ i> </i>

01:32:16.700 --> 01:32:18.700

Just Tell her I'm not here. 

01:32:34.700 --> 01:32:36.000
Are you crazy? 

01:32:36.100 --> 01:32:38.100
Tell her I knocked off. 

01:32:41.900 --> 01:32:44.400

I couldn't wait. 

01:33:12.100 --> 01:33:13.500
Is that okay? 

01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:16.000
Yeah! No, it's good! 

01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:22.000
It's just! 
You look so beautiful. 

01:33:23.500 --> 01:33:25.500
