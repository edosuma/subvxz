Little does he know,
the tables will soon turn.

40:35.206 --> 40:37.275
Once they're all trapped
in the escape pod,

40:37.379 --> 40:39.620
they'll be easy to hypnotize.

Oh, Karen, it's been years

41:02.517 --> 41:04.827
Gazing into your screen
right now,

41:04.931 --> 41:08.448
I feel the very earth
move under my feet.

41:08.551 --> 41:11.206
Oh... Oh, it is moving!

41:11.310 --> 41:12.586
Breaking news!

41:12.689 --> 41:15.551
A giant boulder is rolling
down from Mount Humongous!

41:15.655 --> 41:19.344
And it's headed this way!

41:20.379 --> 41:23.586
Don't worry, I've got it!

41:35.655 --> 41:37.241
Oh!

41:50.758 --> 41:55.896
- No, it's gonna be...

41:56.000 --> 41:57.931
There's gonna be...
If you would just...

41:58.034 --> 41:59.586
- I'm putting together a...

42:10.586 --> 42:12.448
This will be the end.

42:28.206 --> 42:29.413
Get ready, Patrick!

42:29.517 --> 42:32.275
I have a plan to save the town
and I need your help.

42:32.379 --> 42:34.931
- Are you with me?
- I'm right here, hello.

42:35.034 --> 42:37.655
Well, then,
welcome to the team!

42:37.758 --> 42:41.275
Mr. Star!
Mr. Star!

42:41.379 --> 42:43.137
Were you expecting
all these sardines?

42:43.241 --> 42:44.551
Uh-uh.

42:44.655 --> 42:48.620
You said, "If we close our eyes,
maybe nothing will happen."

42:48.724 --> 42:50.482
And we understood,

42:50.586 --> 42:53.344
it's only by shutting out
the turmoil of the world

42:53.448 --> 42:55.896
that we can find salvation.

42:56.000 --> 42:59.482
Give us more wisdom, O Pink One!
Eeeee!

43:00.379 --> 43:01.517
Um...

43:02.344 --> 43:04.034
Life...

43:04.137 --> 43:06.103
...smells...

43:06.206 --> 43:08.172
...weird.

43:08.275 --> 43:11.448
So. Deep.

43:11.551 --> 43:15.310
Life smells weird!
Life smells weird!

43:15.413 --> 43:17.206
What was that all about?

43:17.310 --> 43:20.310
Finally, someone understands!

43:20.413 --> 43:24.793
The inner machinations
of my mind are an enigma.

43:24.896 --> 43:28.413
Come on, Patrick! We gotta
go get Sandy on the team!

43:30.758 --> 43:33.620
Apocalypse:
a special report.

43:33.724 --> 43:36.413
Just 28 hours left
before the end.

43:36.517 --> 43:39.344
How will you spend them?

43:39.448 --> 43:43.586
I'm gonna do all the living
I should've done before.

43:43.689 --> 43:46.241
Gimme another kelp juice,
Johnny.

43:46.344 --> 43:48.965
Carpe diem!

43:49.068 --> 43:51.689
Who're you calling a carp?

43:51.793 --> 43:55.068
I'm gonna find someone
to blame for all this.

43:55.172 --> 43:56.793
What about the squirrel?

43:56.896 --> 43:59.689
That whole "science" thing
is pretty suspicious.

43:59.793 --> 44:02.482
Not only that...
she has lungs.

44:02.586 --> 44:06.068
Yeah!
This is a gill town!

44:06.172 --> 44:09.206
Land Mammals Go Home!

44:09.310 --> 44:13.896
We don't want her kind here.
Let's blame the squirrel!

44:14.000 --> 44:17.103
Blame the squirrel!
Blame the squirrel!

44:17.206 --> 44:19.000
Blame the squirrel!

44:28.310 --> 44:30.482
I thought this was my home.

44:31.551 --> 44:33.655
I guess I was wrong.

44:36.551 --> 44:38.344
'Let us now follow Sandy

44:38.448 --> 44:41.586
'as she takes refuge
in Jellyfish Fields...

I don't have any special skills

45:08.931 --> 45:10.758
to bring to the table,
I'm coming too.

45:10.862 --> 45:14.137
This town doesn't want my help,
they want me gone.

45:14.241 --> 45:17.517

- No, it's not, SpongeBob.

45:20.862 --> 45:25.068
Let's face it,
I never fit in here.

45:25.172 --> 45:28.034
Then again, I never really fit
in Texas either.

45:29.448 --> 45:32.965
I was always the odd rodent out.

of a girl squirrel

and martial arts.

45:40.517 --> 45:43.000
I've never felt at home
anywhere, really.

45:43.103 --> 45:48.034
And now it's time to dig up
my acorns again and push on.

45:51.965 --> 45:54.862
Oh, that's terrible, Sandy.

45:54.965 --> 45:57.586

Oh! Oh!

01:05:50.724 --> 01:05:53.931
Oh, Gary,
I had a terrible nightmare.

01:05:54.034 --> 01:05:58.827
I dreamed the end was coming
at sundown today,

01:05:58.931 --> 01:06:01.517
and Patrick abandoned me.

01:06:02.931 --> 01:06:05.896
Neither of which could ever
actually happen, of course.

01:06:07.379 --> 01:06:09.137
Good morning, Bikini Bottom.

01:06:09.241 --> 01:06:10.448
Our top story:

01:06:10.551 --> 01:06:13.137
The end is coming
at sundown today,

01:06:13.241 --> 01:06:15.793
and friends
are abandoning friends.

01:06:18.206 --> 01:06:20.068
So it wasn't a dream?

01:06:21.620 --> 01:06:28.448
Nooooooooooo...

01:06:29.896 --> 01:06:32.310
'Ten minutes later...'

01:06:32.413 --> 01:06:37.620
oooooooooo...

01:06:38.586 --> 01:06:41.310
'One hour later...'

01:06:41.413 --> 01:06:47.034

01:06:55.448 --> 01:06:56.586
Meow?

01:06:56.689 --> 01:06:58.413
Oh, this?

01:06:58.517 --> 01:07:00.344
Comes right off.

01:07:01.241 --> 01:07:02.379
Meow.

01:07:02.482 --> 01:07:05.758
You're right.
I need to get moving.

01:07:05.862 --> 01:07:08.137
Sandy and I
have a mountain to climb.

01:07:08.241 --> 01:07:10.517
Meow.

01:07:10.620 --> 01:07:13.379
You need to be strong now, Gary.

01:07:13.482 --> 01:07:18.655
If I don't make it back,
and... I may not,

01:07:18.758 --> 01:07:21.206
you have to go on without me.

01:07:22.137 --> 01:07:23.724
Meow.

01:07:23.827 --> 01:07:26.896
And I carry you in mine, Gary.

01:07:28.137 --> 01:07:29.655

01:07:50.310 --> 01:07:53.034
Is that a jellyfish
on a stick?

01:07:53.137 --> 01:07:55.586
Don't make me zap you, bro.

01:07:55.689 --> 01:07:58.517
I've declared
a State of Emergency.

01:07:58.620 --> 01:08:01.482
You're either with me
or you're against me.

01:08:01.586 --> 01:08:03.379
Now move!

01:08:03.482 --> 01:08:07.896
Out of my way, SpongeBob,
I have a concert to organize!

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:09.448

01:08:09.551 --> 01:08:12.103

01:08:26.206 --> 01:08:28.895
Then let's get moving
while the coast is clear.

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:31.136
Do you have
the ingenious bubble device

01:08:31.241 --> 01:08:33.310
to stop the volcano?

01:08:33.412 --> 01:08:35.620

The ingenious bubble device
to stop the volcano.

01:08:51.379 --> 01:08:54.551
Oh, I came up with a name, too:

01:08:54.654 --> 01:08:58.517
"The Erupter Interrupter".

01:09:00.206 --> 01:09:01.412

01:09:16.482 --> 01:09:19.206
If they reach the top
and save the town,

01:09:19.310 --> 01:09:22.241
my whole hypnosis-in-the-escape
pod scheme will be ruined!

01:09:22.344 --> 01:09:25.274
And I still don't have
a plan to stop them.

01:09:25.379 --> 01:09:29.206
Well, Karen,
my evil genius is exhausted.

01:09:29.310 --> 01:09:30.895

01:32:25.241 --> 01:32:26.344
Ooh!

01:32:27.137 --> 01:32:28.448
Ooh!

01:32:29.103 --> 01:32:30.379
Ooh!

01:32:38.965 --> 01:32:40.689
This is the government's fault!

01:32:40.793 --> 01:32:43.068
This is the media's fault!

01:32:43.172 --> 01:32:45.586
It's your fault!

01:32:57.034 --> 01:32:59.034
'Meanwhile,

01:32:59.137 --> 01:33:02.965
'high on the treacherous slope
of Mount Humongous,

01:33:03.068 --> 01:33:07.655
'SpongeBob and Sandy are
ze only hope for Bikini Bottom.

01:33:07.758 --> 01:33:09.172
'Will they reach the top

01:33:09.275 --> 01:33:11.896

can stop them?

01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:13.241

01:33:13.344 --> 01:33:15.586
'It is a race against time.'

01:33:15.689 --> 01:33:18.689
It's a race against time,
SpongeBob!

01:33:18.793 --> 01:33:20.517
Remember what I told ya:

01:33:20.620 --> 01:33:22.482
don't stop till you drop.

01:33:22.586 --> 01:33:26.241
Yeah,
let's definitely not drop.

01:33:26.344 --> 01:33:27.517
We got this.

01:33:27.620 --> 01:33:30.137
Eyes on the prize.

01:33:33.241 --> 01:33:37.103
Is it just me or is it getting
kinda toasty up here?

01:33:37.206 --> 01:33:39.931
I'm sweatin' like a snowman
in a steam room.

01:33:40.034 --> 01:33:42.793
We're almost at the top,
come on!

01:33:43.620 --> 01:33:46.344
Alright, now's our chance.

01:33:46.448 --> 01:33:48.827
Let's do this. Goodbye.

01:33:49.724 --> 01:33:52.344
- Ready.
- Aim.

01:33:52.448 --> 01:33:54.000
Fire!

01:33:55.551 --> 01:33:57.758
Sandy, do you hear that?

01:33:58.896 --> 01:34:01.965
It's an avalanche!

01:34:12.448 --> 01:34:13.793
Ooh!

01:34:13.896 --> 01:34:15.379
Uh! Ooh! Uh...!

01:34:15.482 --> 01:34:16.965
I'm slipping!

01:34:17.068 --> 01:34:19.068
I've got you!

01:34:19.172 --> 01:34:21.206
Uh... Ooh! Ooh!

01:34:21.310 --> 01:34:24.068
I think this is goodbye, Sandy.

01:34:24.172 --> 01:34:25.482
These are my last words.

01:34:25.586 --> 01:34:27.379
No, SpongeBob, please!

01:34:27.482 --> 01:34:28.827
Look over there!

01:34:28.931 --> 01:34:30.482
Those are your last words?

01:34:30.586 --> 01:34:32.689
No! It's Patrick!

01:34:32.793 --> 01:34:35.241
And he has your jetpack!

01:34:37.827 --> 01:34:40.068
I'll save you!

01:34:40.172 --> 01:34:57.137
- SpooooongeBoooooob!
- Paaaaaaaatriiiiiiiiiiiiick!

01:34:58.172 --> 01:34:59.724
You came back!

01:34:59.827 --> 01:35:02.586
Of course I did.

01:35:02.689 --> 01:35:05.655
I hope it's OK
I borrowed your invention.

01:35:05.758 --> 01:35:08.275
Mi jetpack es su jetpack.

01:35:08.379 --> 01:35:11.517
Aw! I don't know
what that means.

01:35:11.620 --> 01:35:14.172
I realized something today,
buddy.

01:35:14.275 --> 01:35:18.655
The total devotion of adoring
masses is pretty awesome,

01:35:18.758 --> 01:35:21.931
but they're not really
there for me.

01:35:22.034 --> 01:35:23.793
Not like you are.

01:35:23.896 --> 01:35:27.172
Hey, we're BFFs.

01:35:27.275 --> 01:35:29.758
Being there for each other
is what we do.

01:35:32.482 --> 01:35:34.241
We're best friends
and this is the friend dance!

01:35:34.344 --> 01:35:35.827
We're best friends and this is
the friend dance!

01:35:35.931 --> 01:35:37.413
- We're best friends...
- This is real sweet,

01:35:37.517 --> 01:35:40.000
but the town's gonna be toast
if we don't hurry up.

01:35:40.103 --> 01:35:41.000
Alright.

01:35:41.103 --> 01:35:43.793
Team, let's move!

01:35:56.172 --> 01:35:58.413
Boys, we have a problem.

01:35:58.517 --> 01:35:59.965
We do?

01:36:00.068 --> 01:36:01.206
Oh, you mean

01:36:01.310 --> 01:36:04.172
this giant unclimbable
volcano mouth of doom.

01:36:04.275 --> 01:36:05.758
No way can I fit
through those squeezes.

01:36:05.862 --> 01:36:08.103
Oh, me neither.

01:36:08.206 --> 01:36:10.275
But I bet you could,
SpongeBob.

01:36:10.379 --> 01:36:11.931
Done gone it, that's right!

01:36:12.034 --> 01:36:13.448
You can squeeze
through anything.

01:36:13.551 --> 01:36:14.827
Look at that thing!

01:36:14.931 --> 01:36:16.551
I can't do this.

01:36:16.655 --> 01:36:18.275
Mr. Krabs was right:

01:36:18.379 --> 01:36:21.172
- I'm just a simple sponge.
- No!

01:36:21.275 --> 01:36:22.689
Remember when we were
stuck inside

01:36:22.793 --> 01:36:24.689
- and there was nothing on TV?
- Yeah?

01:36:24.793 --> 01:36:27.517
I thought it was
an epic life-ending disaster,

01:36:27.620 --> 01:36:30.482
but you got me through it.
You always see the bright side.

01:36:30.586 --> 01:36:32.482
And you never give up.

01:36:32.586 --> 01:36:34.413
When I was ready
to bail on y'all,

01:36:34.517 --> 01:36:35.758
you kept me going.

01:36:35.862 --> 01:36:39.206
That's what you bring
to the team, SpongeBob.

01:36:39.310 --> 01:36:40.827
Management skills.

01:36:42.034 --> 01:36:44.586
- Really?
- You are manager material.

01:36:44.689 --> 01:36:47.620
And you can do this.

01:36:51.827 --> 01:36:54.586
Give me the Erupter Interrupter.

01:38:35.137 --> 01:38:39.241

01:38:39.344 --> 01:38:41.517
I don't get the question.

01:38:41.620 --> 01:38:45.448

or "One, two, three, uh!"

01:38:45.551 --> 01:38:47.137

01:38:47.241 --> 01:38:48.931

One, two, three, uh!

01:39:18.896 --> 01:39:21.310
Now we wait until sundown
and hope that it works.

01:39:21.413 --> 01:39:22.551
"Hope"?

01:39:23.724 --> 01:39:25.482
What do you mean, "hope"?

01:39:25.586 --> 01:39:27.551
I think my calculations
are right,

01:39:27.655 --> 01:39:30.344
but as they say in Texas,
the proof is in the cowpie.

01:39:30.448 --> 01:39:31.413
I love pie.

01:39:31.517 --> 01:39:33.551
We'll know for sure
in ten minutes.

01:39:35.068 --> 01:39:38.482
Hey, what's that sound?

01:39:38.586 --> 01:39:40.448
It's coming from down there.

01:39:42.862 --> 01:39:45.000
They're all attacking
each other!

01:39:49.137 --> 01:39:51.413
That was the Krusty Krab!

01:39:51.517 --> 01:39:53.551
Volcano or not,

01:39:53.655 --> 01:39:58.172
Bikini Bottom's
gonna destroy itself.

01:39:58.275 --> 01:40:01.000
'It's a big finale
of "SpongeBob the Musical",

01:40:01.103 --> 01:40:03.448
'live on stage. Next!'

01:40:12.137 --> 01:40:13.758
If we don't stop this,

01:40:13.862 --> 01:40:16.310
Bikini Bottom's not going
to last ten more minutes.

01:40:16.413 --> 01:40:18.034
But it'll take hours
to climb down.

01:40:18.137 --> 01:40:19.206
Guys, I have an idea.

01:40:19.310 --> 01:40:20.931
We could roll down.
It might hurt a little.

01:40:21.034 --> 01:40:22.896
- I have an idea.
- If we tuck in our heads...

01:40:23.000 --> 01:40:25.275
Pay attention to me!

01:40:26.310 --> 01:40:28.206
This jetpack,
it has a parachute.

01:40:28.310 --> 01:40:29.827
- Of course!
- See?

01:40:29.931 --> 01:40:32.206
My ideas are worth
listening to.

01:40:32.310 --> 01:40:34.000
You can say that again.

01:40:34.103 --> 01:40:38.137
- See? My ideas are...
- OK, boys!

01:40:38.241 --> 01:40:40.310
Let's do this thing!

01:40:43.172 --> 01:40:45.620
Us, go!

01:40:56.586 --> 01:40:59.724
Stoooooooop!

01:41:00.896 --> 01:41:02.862
What are you doing?

01:41:02.965 --> 01:41:04.724
Is that a rhetorical question?

01:41:04.827 --> 01:41:06.655
Quick, everyone!

01:41:06.758 --> 01:41:09.206
Those fools perished
in an avalanche!

01:41:09.310 --> 01:41:10.620
We have to get
into the escape pod now.

01:41:10.724 --> 01:41:13.517
Honey.
They're alive.

01:41:13.620 --> 01:41:16.655
- They are?
-  Yes, we are.

01:41:16.758 --> 01:41:19.758
But thanks for worrying
about our safety, Plankton.

01:41:19.862 --> 01:41:22.724
Seems you're the only one
with some decency left.

01:41:22.827 --> 01:41:23.965
We made it to the top

01:41:24.068 --> 01:41:27.172
and dropped the bubble device
into the volcano.

01:41:27.275 --> 01:41:29.896
In seven minutes,
we'll know if we saved the town.

01:41:30.000 --> 01:41:33.448
But if you keep going like this,
it won't matter either way.

01:41:33.551 --> 01:41:35.448
There won't be anything left
to save!

01:41:35.551 --> 01:41:36.793
Deep thoughts, SpongeBob,
but...

01:41:36.896 --> 01:41:42.344
I'm not finiiiiiished!

01:41:45.482 --> 01:41:50.344
At a time like this,
we should be coming together.

01:41:50.448 --> 01:41:53.586
Instead, you're all looking
for someone to blame

01:41:53.689 --> 01:41:55.551
or to follow...

01:41:55.655 --> 01:41:58.275
to exploit or control.

01:41:58.379 --> 01:42:00.103
You're all so scared
for yourselves

01:42:00.206 --> 01:42:03.068
that you're turning
against each other.

01:42:03.172 --> 01:42:05.655
That's just as dangerous
as any volcano.

01:42:05.758 --> 01:42:08.241
It doesn't have to be like this.

01:42:09.931 --> 01:42:14.344
We might only have
seven minutes left,

01:42:14.448 --> 01:42:20.517
but we could make them
the best seven minutes ever.

01:42:21.448 --> 01:42:22.689
How?

01:42:22.793 --> 01:42:24.448
The whole town is in ruins!

01:42:24.551 --> 01:42:26.827
Like I said before, SpongeBob:

01:42:26.931 --> 01:42:28.827
the world's a horrible place

01:42:28.931 --> 01:42:32.241
filled with fear,
suffering and despair.

01:42:32.344 --> 01:42:33.896
And you didn't believe me.

01:42:34.000 --> 01:42:35.758
I still don't.

01:42:38.172 --> 01:42:40.310
Just look at the sun.

01:42:42.068 --> 01:42:43.931
It's still shining.

01:42:45.931 --> 01:42:48.172
Look at the kelp.

01:42:48.896 --> 01:42:50.310
It's still...

01:42:51.103 --> 01:42:52.586
kelp-y.

01:42:53.965 --> 01:42:55.413
