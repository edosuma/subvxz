Previously on The Vampire Diaries:

00:04.086 --> 00:06.130
FORBES: Someone drove this stake
through his heart.

00:06.339 --> 00:07.589
I'd know if I were killing.

00:07.799 --> 00:09.758
You wear a ring that lets you cheat death.

00:09.968 --> 00:12.261
How many times can you die
before it changes you?

00:12.470 --> 00:16.515
- What are you doing here, Sage?
- I heard Finn was freed from that casket.

00:16.725 --> 00:17.891
He's my one true love.

00:18.101 --> 00:20.019
Esther's planning on killing her family.

00:20.228 --> 00:23.939
She's linked them all together.
Whatever happens to one happens to all.

00:24.149 --> 00:29.194
It's not over, Nik. A white oak tree 300
years after we fled back to the old world.

00:29.404 --> 00:32.281
- That tree could kill us.
- 1912, Salvatore Milling Company...

00:32.490 --> 00:36.493
...chopped down an old white oak tree
used to make the Wickery Bridge.

00:36.703 --> 00:39.913
- We have a weapon.
- Let's go kill some Originals.

Morning, sunshine.

00:53.344 --> 00:55.679
Hey. How's Alaric?

00:55.889 --> 00:57.681
Indecent. But fine.

00:57.891 --> 01:00.559
So then does that mean
there was no issues last night?

01:00.769 --> 01:03.020
Nope. Slept like a baby. Woke up Alaric.

01:03.229 --> 01:05.313
No headlines
about dead Council members.

01:05.522 --> 01:08.442
Then why do I feel like
you're hiding something from me?

01:08.651 --> 01:12.946
Maybe because you're being all paranoid
and control freaky?

01:13.156 --> 01:14.990
What'd you bring me?

01:15.200 --> 01:18.118
Ooh, chocolate muffins.
You know what they say.

01:18.328 --> 01:20.829
The way to a killer's heart
is through his stomach.

01:21.039 --> 01:22.247
They're not for you.

01:22.457 --> 01:25.042
Fine. Keep convincing yourself
you're still mad at me.

01:25.251 --> 01:27.795
But sadly, Ric's gonna have to miss
Elena time today.

01:28.004 --> 01:29.797
You know, lockdown and all.

01:30.006 --> 01:33.258
Just take it, give it to him,
and tell him that I miss him, okay?

01:33.468 --> 01:34.885
- With pleasure.
ELENA: Please.

01:35.095 --> 01:37.763

Have a great day. Thanks for coming by.

Walking down the stairs.

01:47.982 --> 01:49.066
Opening front door...

01:49.275 --> 01:51.527
...and she's gone.

02:06.459 --> 02:08.961
STEFAN: This needs a sharper point.
- Got it.

02:09.169 --> 02:13.048
We have stakes to kill an Original.
Not gonna miss because you can't whittle.

02:13.258 --> 02:16.051
I said, I got it. Stop micromanaging.

02:16.261 --> 02:19.555
If you guys got this under control,
I'm gonna call the sheriff.

02:19.764 --> 02:23.058
- I wanna turn myself in.
- No, you don't.

02:23.268 --> 02:26.395
I have a homicidal alter ego.
Unlike some people in this room...

02:26.604 --> 02:29.898
...I would like to take responsibility
for the people I've killed.

02:30.108 --> 02:33.277
If you wanted to turn yourself in,
you wouldn't be saying it.

02:33.486 --> 02:36.572
You cannot psychoanalyze me.
I killed Caroline's father.

02:36.781 --> 02:39.032
I nearly killed Meredith.
Everything's changed.

02:39.242 --> 02:42.077
You're not turning yourself in.
Bonnie's herbs are working...

02:42.287 --> 02:43.912
...and we have Originals to kill.

02:44.122 --> 02:47.082
His morals get questionable
when he has revenge on the brain.

02:47.292 --> 02:50.169
Klaus needs to die.
We finally have the chance to kill him.

02:50.378 --> 02:52.796
So you are not turning yourself in.

02:57.010 --> 03:00.262
Here's your ring, Ric. Put it on.

03:00.471 --> 03:02.764
That ring is the reason
I've killed people.

03:02.974 --> 03:04.975
DAMON:
It's also the reason you're alive.

03:05.602 --> 03:08.604
You're going vampire hunting, Ric.
Wear it.

03:18.781 --> 03:20.949
CAROLINE:
Alaric Saltzman killed my father?

03:21.451 --> 03:23.410
I can't expect you to be okay with this...

03:23.620 --> 03:27.206
...but these herbs that Bonnie's
giving him, they're healing him...

03:27.415 --> 03:29.124
...and keeping the dark side buried.

03:29.334 --> 03:31.710
Yeah, and that's supposed
to make everything okay?

03:31.920 --> 03:38.091
No, it's not okay. It's horrible,
and I feel horrible about it, but...

03:39.135 --> 03:42.846
He's a victim of something supernatural.
He didn't ask for this.

03:43.056 --> 03:45.390
It just happened to him,
just like Bonnie's mom.

03:45.600 --> 03:48.644
She didn't ask to become a vampire...

03:48.853 --> 03:51.438
...and neither did Stefan or Tyler.

03:52.106 --> 03:53.982
Or me.

03:56.945 --> 03:58.153
Or you.

04:00.365 --> 04:02.991
None of you asked for this.

04:04.285 --> 04:08.872
But who would I be
if I just turned my back on any of you?

04:13.753 --> 04:16.213
Oh, Elena Gilbert.

04:16.714 --> 04:19.382
Savior of the cursed and the damned.

04:20.385 --> 04:23.011
Hey. What's with the cryptic
secret-meeting text?

04:23.221 --> 04:25.264
I don't know.
Stefan just said to meet here.

04:25.473 --> 04:28.850
Where's Bonnie? I texted her too.

04:29.060 --> 04:31.520
Uh, Bonnie's mom bailed on her again.

04:31.729 --> 04:35.148
- So I think we should leave her out.
- What are we doing here?

04:35.358 --> 04:38.610
I found some more white oak.
Long story, wait for the movie.

04:38.820 --> 04:43.115
Hang on. White oak?
You have a weapon that can kill Klaus?

04:43.324 --> 04:45.659
Nope. We all have a weapon.

04:52.917 --> 04:56.003
- Hello, Finn.
- Hello, Niklaus.

04:56.212 --> 04:59.214
- I have nothing to say to you.
KLAUS: Well, I'm not here to chat.

04:59.424 --> 05:01.967
I will ask you one time, though.
Where's our mother?

05:02.176 --> 05:04.553
Gone to find another way
to end our lives.

05:04.762 --> 05:08.890
And when she does,
I will sacrifice myself all over again.

05:09.100 --> 05:12.853
How fortunate that I found you.
I require your assistance.

05:13.062 --> 05:16.064
I have no wish to help you.
Only to see you dead.

05:16.274 --> 05:18.734
Right. You see,
you won't be able to see me dead...

05:18.943 --> 05:21.862
...because if I die, then you die,
so wish unfulfilled.

05:22.071 --> 05:24.197
Bother someone else
with your hollow charms.

05:24.407 --> 05:26.408
Why, when I can bother my big brother?

05:26.617 --> 05:28.910
I need you to accompany me
back to Mystic Falls.

05:29.120 --> 05:32.706
I have a witch who can help undo
Esther's spell that linked us together.

05:32.915 --> 05:36.835
- I have no wish to be unlinked.
- Again with the wishes.

05:37.045 --> 05:40.505
Let me rephrase. You will come back
with me or I will put you back...

05:40.715 --> 05:43.175
...in that coffin
in which you rotted for 900 years.

05:43.384 --> 05:45.927
What happens to one happens to all.

05:46.137 --> 05:48.263
You may not feel
the effects of the dagger...

05:48.473 --> 05:50.390
...but you'd lose your precious Rebekah.

05:50.600 --> 05:53.560
Wouldn't be the first time.

05:59.901 --> 06:03.070
Let's not make this any worse
than it has to be, darling brother.

06:03.279 --> 06:07.282
You're siding with him?
Rebekah, he stored us in boxes.

06:07.492 --> 06:09.826
At least he's not trying
to make us extinct.

06:13.081 --> 06:14.831
What are you gonna do? Kill me?

06:15.208 --> 06:17.501
Oh, yeah, that's right.
You've got a death wish.

06:17.710 --> 06:19.378
Fine. Pathetic, but fine.

06:19.587 --> 06:22.506
The thing is I'm not gonna let you
take the rest of us down with you.

STEFAN: Klaus has always been
one step ahead of us.

06:30.306 --> 06:32.307
But now we have the advantage.

06:32.517 --> 06:34.810
We're all armed and they are all linked.

06:35.019 --> 06:37.437
Meaning we only need
to kill one of them.

06:37.647 --> 06:39.731
We need to seize the best opportunity...

06:39.941 --> 06:42.776
...which means we need
to prepare for every opportunity.

06:42.985 --> 06:46.905
Scenario number one.
You get to play Klaus.

06:47.115 --> 06:49.741
- Okay.
- Rebekah is our target.

06:49.951 --> 06:51.827
We'll distract her, catch her off guard.

06:52.036 --> 06:55.789
To do that, we need to keep Klaus
separate and occupied.

06:56.332 --> 06:59.126
- Caroline.
- Why do I always have to be Klaus bait?

06:59.335 --> 07:03.046
He's obsessed with you. But for right
now we need you to play Rebekah.

07:03.256 --> 07:05.465
We use the quarterback to distract her.
Keep her talking.

07:05.675 --> 07:08.677
- How?
- Act interested. She's lonely, desperate.

07:08.886 --> 07:11.638
- Clearly. She slept with you.
DAMON: Mm. Heh.

I come up from behind her...

07:15.393 --> 07:17.561
...grab her arms like this.
- Ow.

07:17.770 --> 07:19.980
Which gives me time for one shot.

07:20.189 --> 07:22.941
Got it? Good.
So we all have one stake.

07:23.151 --> 07:26.111
We keep it hidden, and we look out
for any opportunity we have.

from his sire bond to Klaus.

- Do I have a choice?

07:39.083 --> 07:40.125
Good point.

We have 12 stakes.
Twelve shots at killing one Original.

07:44.922 --> 07:47.048
We can do this.

It does occasionally have its uses.

08:33.721 --> 08:35.263

why retribution is in order.

30:53.518 --> 30:55.018
Leave.

30:55.228 --> 30:56.270
No.

30:57.730 --> 30:59.231
Go on, leave.

Vampire disposal?

31:35.560 --> 31:37.811
Not my strong suit.

31:38.396 --> 31:42.649
- Ugh. Where'd Stefan go?
- Trading the stakes for Damon.

31:43.443 --> 31:46.111
- All of them?
- No, not all of them.

31:46.321 --> 31:50.782
We still have enough to kill three
out of the four of them...

31:50.992 --> 31:52.701
...if we can figure out who to save.

31:52.911 --> 31:53.952
[SCOFFS]

31:54.162 --> 31:55.412
How are we supposed to do that?

31:56.623 --> 31:58.832
I have no idea.

31:59.042 --> 32:01.335
You were turned with Damon's blood...

32:01.544 --> 32:04.338
...and Damon and Stefan
were turned by Katherine.

32:04.547 --> 32:07.716
And we know that Katherine was turned
by a vampire named Rose.

32:08.968 --> 32:10.344
Well, who turned Rose?

32:11.596 --> 32:13.347
We don't know.

32:13.640 --> 32:15.807
But it can only lead back to one Original.

32:16.017 --> 32:19.144
And if the odds are in our favor,
hopefully it won't be Klaus.

32:19.354 --> 32:21.480
So we can still kill him.

Even if Klaus didn't create
our bloodline...

that he turned one of us.

Oh, my God.

32:46.005 --> 32:47.965

Minus the stake that's in my brother...

33:16.786 --> 33:20.497
...how many more stakes are out there
that can kill me?

33:24.585 --> 33:27.504
- Eleven.
KLAUS: Eleven. Really.

33:27.714 --> 33:30.424
- So not eight, then.
- You really shouldn't have lied.

33:30.633 --> 33:34.219
- I'll get you the other three.
- Yeah, that'd be nice. Or, since you lied...

33:34.429 --> 33:37.222
...maybe I'll compel
your brother to chew out his tongue.

33:39.892 --> 33:43.311
Do you really have no appreciation
for me?

33:43.521 --> 33:47.065
I have given you someone to hate.
To loathe.

33:47.275 --> 33:52.195
A target for all of your anger
so you don't have to turn it on yourself.

33:53.072 --> 33:57.034
I've given your life purpose,
as your friend.

you should be thanking me.

- Unh.

Step down or you both die.

have to get me the other two.

Fine. Let's say a prayer for Finn...

longer than he lived as a man.

He's better off in death.

Is that how you'd speak of me if I died?

You let the Salvatores loose
with stakes that kill us.

Since when did you have a soft spot
for them?

in the end they would die for each other.
