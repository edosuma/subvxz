00:01.203 --> 00:04.604
<i>Those are your nominees</i>
<i>for Best On Screen Kiss. </i>

00:04.705 --> 00:06.970
<i>And the Teenie Award goes to... </i>

00:07.042 --> 00:12.036
<i>"You know, if we'd been able to finish</i>
<i>our kiss on</i> Zombie High,

00:12.147 --> 00:14.081
<i>"we might've won this thing. "</i>

00:16.819 --> 00:19.310
- Your turn.
- <i>Oh. Right. </i>

00:20.022 --> 00:22.490
<i>"Oh, Jake, I bet you say that</i>
<i>to all your co-stars. </i>

00:22.591 --> 00:23.785
<i>"Push Jake. "</i>

00:27.296 --> 00:29.491
<i>I mean... </i>

00:29.565 --> 00:31.829
<i>And the Teenie... </i>

00:34.770 --> 00:37.967
<i>And the Teenie for Best Teen Kiss</i>
<i>goes to... </i>

00:39.942 --> 00:44.504
<i>Frankie Muniz and his pillow</i>
<i>in</i> The Lonely Sophomore.

00:46.281 --> 00:47.873
<i>Good job, Frankie. </i>

00:47.983 --> 00:52.283
<i>"Unfortunately, Frankie's</i>
<i>doing a movie in Romania. "</i>

00:53.021 --> 00:56.047
<i>"And the pillow has a hot date</i>
<i>with a bunk bed. </i>

00:56.124 --> 00:57.523
<i>"Hold for laughter. "</i>

01:00.329 --> 01:02.524
<i>God, I did it again!</i>

01:04.099 --> 01:06.226
<i>We'll be accepting this</i>
<i>on Frankie's behalf. </i>

01:06.301 --> 01:09.134
<i>Thank you. Oh, and next year,</i>
<i>I promise I'll do better. Toodles. </i>

01:14.243 --> 01:17.235
Man! Darn it!

01:17.346 --> 01:19.746
Come on.
People love it when we mess up.

01:19.815 --> 01:23.979
- Besides, I think you did great.
- Thanks. Hold for applause.

01:25.954 --> 01:27.285
Great to see you again, Hannah.

01:27.389 --> 01:29.653
Can't wait to get you back on the show
to finish that kiss.

01:29.725 --> 01:33.252
- I'll have my people call your people.
- Great. My people will be waiting.

01:33.328 --> 01:36.525
That would be me.
I'm Lola, her most important people.

01:36.832 --> 01:39.426
Which is why I may look familiar,
but we've never met.

01:40.802 --> 01:42.497
Not even in school or anything.

01:43.805 --> 01:45.067
Because I'm home-schooled.

01:46.475 --> 01:47.499
In Canada.

01:48.543 --> 01:49.976
Where the moose are.

01:52.047 --> 01:57.576
Okay. Nice to meet you, too. Bye.

01:57.653 --> 01:59.382
Bye, Jake.

01:59.454 --> 02:03.891
"Where the moose are"? "In Canada"?
"Where I'm home-schooled"?

02:04.326 --> 02:06.817
- Lola, way to keep your cover.
- Oh, who cares?

02:06.895 --> 02:09.556
Hey, you know what? I heard
he broke up with that girl at school.

02:09.664 --> 02:12.463
That means
the zombie slayer's available.

02:12.534 --> 02:14.001
I know.

02:14.202 --> 02:16.170
I can't wait to go to school on Monday.

02:16.271 --> 02:18.705
Maybe Jake and I can finally
get together.

02:22.644 --> 02:24.339
Or not.

02:27.282 --> 02:28.749
Sorry.

02:28.951 --> 02:30.441
No, I'm fine with it.

02:31.553 --> 02:32.577
I'm cool.

02:33.055 --> 02:35.615
I'm really, really fine.

02:37.025 --> 02:38.185
Oopsies.

02:38.593 --> 02:42.051
Frankie won't be when he finds out
you tore off his Teenie's tiny head.

02:43.098 --> 02:44.360
Sorry, Teenie.

02:44.466 --> 02:45.524
It's okay.

02:52.407 --> 02:54.068
<i> Come on!</i>

02:54.142 --> 02:56.542
<i>You get the limo out front</i>

02:58.246 --> 03:01.272
<i>Hottest styles, every shoe, every color</i>

03:01.383 --> 03:05.479
<i>Yeah, when you're famous</i>
<i>it can be kind of fun</i>

03:05.587 --> 03:09.990
<i>It's really you</i>
<i>but no one ever discovers</i>

03:10.058 --> 03:13.858
<i>Who would have thought</i>
<i>that a girl like me</i>

03:13.929 --> 03:19.094
<i>Would double as a superstar?</i>

03:19.167 --> 03:23.467
<i>You get the best of both worlds</i>

03:23.538 --> 03:25.062
<i>Chill it out, take it slow</i>

03:25.140 --> 03:26.664
<i>Then you rock out the show</i>

03:26.742 --> 03:31.338
<i>You get the best of both worlds</i>

03:31.413 --> 03:33.108
<i>Mix it all together</i>

03:33.181 --> 03:36.150
<i>And you know that it's</i>
<i>the best of both worlds</i>

03:43.291 --> 03:45.657
Okay, you got enough shots.
Can we have a little privacy now?

03:45.727 --> 03:46.716
Thanks.

03:49.765 --> 03:51.528
Wow.

03:51.633 --> 03:54.727
First the Teenie, now this.
You got it bad.

03:56.138 --> 03:57.469
I know.

03:57.539 --> 04:00.167
And what's worst is, Jake liked you first,
and you turned him down.

04:00.876 --> 04:02.241
Otherwise that could have been you
over there

04:02.344 --> 04:04.505
giving Jake little popcorn kissies.

04:07.249 --> 04:09.581
- Lilly, you got ice cream on your face.
- Where?

04:09.651 --> 04:10.948
Right there.

04:14.056 --> 04:15.114
Thanks.

04:15.824 --> 04:17.916
Hey, need a napkin?

04:18.026 --> 04:19.493
No thanks, I'm good.

04:21.730 --> 04:23.095
Speak for yourself.

04:26.301 --> 04:27.734
But, you know,

04:29.304 --> 04:32.000
a girl can never have too many napkins.

04:32.107 --> 04:34.302
- Thanks. I'm Miley.
- I'm Willis.

04:37.979 --> 04:40.948
You are so funny, so funny.

04:41.016 --> 04:44.281
Here, take a seat. You come here often?

04:44.386 --> 04:46.217
No. I just moved from Seattle.

04:46.288 --> 04:49.086
Seattle.

04:49.491 --> 04:51.823
There is no stopping you now, is there?

04:56.098 --> 04:57.258
I don't get it either.

04:58.934 --> 05:00.458
So, where are you going to school?

05:00.535 --> 05:02.765
Eastwood Prep. But I'm graduating.

05:02.871 --> 05:05.101
You're a senior? Because we're just...

05:05.173 --> 05:06.265
Starving!

05:06.341 --> 05:09.799
Why don't I go get us all some pretzels?
Wait here, Walter.

05:09.911 --> 05:10.935
It's Willis.

05:13.248 --> 05:15.409
Still so funny.
You just keep on killing me!

05:17.152 --> 05:19.780
- Make sure he doesn't go anywhere.
- What are you doing?

05:20.021 --> 05:21.682
You can't flirt with a senior.
He's old enough...

05:21.790 --> 05:25.123
To make Jake jealous? So he'll realize
I'm the girl he really wants?

05:25.227 --> 05:29.459
Ooh, diabolical.
Or should I say guy-abolical?

05:31.133 --> 05:32.464
You shouldn't say anything.

05:34.736 --> 05:37.261
Oh, hi, Jake.
I didn't notice you here on the beach.

05:37.339 --> 05:41.105
Oh, hey, Miley. I didn't notice
you here on the beach either.

05:42.277 --> 05:45.041
This is Holly. She's an actress.

05:45.147 --> 05:47.707
Oh, yeah. I saw you in that commercial.

05:47.782 --> 05:49.374
You know, the one where
you had to have that

05:49.451 --> 05:51.942
really uncomfortable talk
with your mom.

05:53.822 --> 05:55.449
I hope everything worked out.

05:56.591 --> 05:59.458
That wasn't really my mom, okay?

06:00.195 --> 06:02.527
Well, as long as the toe fungus is gone.

06:04.432 --> 06:06.457
So, who's your friend?

06:06.535 --> 06:10.528
Oh, that's Willis. He's from Seattle.

06:10.605 --> 06:13.301
You know, uh,
the Coffee Capital of America.

06:13.575 --> 06:15.566
He drinks it black.

06:16.778 --> 06:19.008
- Holly drinks espresso.
- Willis shaves.

06:19.114 --> 06:21.139
- Holly waxes.
- Willis is a senior.

06:23.018 --> 06:24.007
Wow.

06:25.253 --> 06:26.345
Toodles.

06:28.957 --> 06:32.188
Hey, I was wondering
if maybe you wanted to go to this

06:32.260 --> 06:33.318
bowling party with me.

06:33.428 --> 06:36.864
Sure, of course I'll go
to the bowling party with you.

06:36.932 --> 06:38.763
With all of your senior classmates.

06:41.903 --> 06:43.803
Oh, Holly. Open up.

06:46.274 --> 06:48.902
Oh, Willis. Are you hungry?

06:56.851 --> 06:59.877
Why did Miley just shove a pretzel
in that guy's mouth?

07:00.622 --> 07:02.681
I think it's supposed to look romantic.

07:06.628 --> 07:09.062
Okay, Dad,
at the parent-teacher conference,

07:09.130 --> 07:12.566
you may hear a little something
about a belching contest.

07:12.667 --> 07:14.532
I just want you to know
that it never happened.

07:16.037 --> 07:18.369
And I was not the champion!

07:20.075 --> 07:21.940
I can't approve of that kind of behavior.

07:22.010 --> 07:24.035
But I guess better out the attic
than out the basement.

07:27.549 --> 07:30.609
Thanks, Dad, but don't try
that kind of humor with Ms. Kunkle.

07:30.685 --> 07:32.676
She doesn't have a funny bone
in her body.

07:32.787 --> 07:35.813
I bet I'll get a giggle out of her.
I know she hasn't heard this one.

07:35.890 --> 07:38.085
- Knock-knock.
- No, no, no, Dad!

07:38.193 --> 07:40.525
No "knock-knock" jokes, all right?
No jokes at all!

07:40.629 --> 07:43.462
If you even think something funny,
I'm going to get detention!

07:43.531 --> 07:45.726
Stop exaggerating.

07:46.101 --> 07:49.036
No one who dedicates themself
to a life of educating kids

07:49.104 --> 07:51.299
- could be that mean.
- Oh, yeah?

07:54.509 --> 07:59.208
Stewart, last night your father
tried to tell me a knock-knock joke.

07:59.314 --> 08:01.714
No. I swear, I told him not to.

08:01.783 --> 08:03.148
Are you blinking?

08:03.718 --> 08:07.279
There is no blinking in my class!

08:07.389 --> 08:08.447
I'm not blinking!

08:11.459 --> 08:12.687
Oh, no!

08:12.827 --> 08:16.854
That's it! I couldn't do anything
to your father. But you...

08:20.135 --> 08:21.830
Solitary for a week!

08:21.903 --> 08:26.101
- Not the cage!
- Oh, yes, the cage.

08:26.174 --> 08:29.337
But I'm so young. Please. No!

08:32.847 --> 08:36.578
Dad, please,
just get in, and then get out. All right?

08:36.650 --> 08:40.347
Just save all that wonderful charm
for the checkout lady at the market.

08:40.422 --> 08:44.153
That reminds me, I can use
some of my funny food puns

08:44.225 --> 08:45.453
to break the ice with her.

08:46.494 --> 08:48.689
It's grape to meet you, ma'am.

08:51.099 --> 08:53.033
Lettuce sit and talk.

08:54.102 --> 08:55.967
Whoa doggies, I'm on fire!

08:57.038 --> 08:58.300
I'm doomed.

09:03.912 --> 09:05.743
You can't go out with this guy.

09:05.814 --> 09:08.248
You start bowling with a senior,
the next thing you know

09:08.350 --> 09:11.251
you're go-karting with a college guy!
It's madness!

09:12.554 --> 09:16.183
Hey, who sprinkled drama queen
in your oatmeal this morning?

09:18.093 --> 09:21.324
Relax, you guys.
I was never going to go out with Willis.

09:21.529 --> 09:23.224
I just said it to make Jake jealous.

09:23.298 --> 09:25.425
So, how are you going to get out
of the bowling party?

09:25.500 --> 09:27.365
I'll just call Willis and tell him the truth.

09:28.570 --> 09:32.973
That I totally forgot I'm allergic
to rental shoes. Perfect.

09:33.108 --> 09:35.542
- Hey, guys.
Hey, Jake.

09:36.010 --> 09:39.002
So I guess I'll, uh, see you
at the bowling alley tonight.

09:39.114 --> 09:41.207
Yeah, that sounds... What?

09:42.617 --> 09:46.018
Well, I just thought that Holly and I
would have a great time bowling, too.

09:46.087 --> 09:49.420
- So we'll probably bump into you there.
- I'm sure you would, but, uh,

09:49.491 --> 09:51.220
- I'm not sure if I'm still going to...
- Aw.

09:51.292 --> 09:54.125
Did your senior boyfriend
already break up with you?

09:54.629 --> 09:59.498
No. I'm just not sure if...
I'm wearing my red top or my green,

09:59.701 --> 10:01.430
just in case you're looking for me.

10:01.503 --> 10:03.835
- Thanks for being so thoughtful.
- My pleasure.

10:03.905 --> 10:06.533
- See you there.
- Yes, you will.

10:08.510 --> 10:10.671
Don't worry.
I've got him right where I want him.

10:12.547 --> 10:14.981
Which is where?

10:15.717 --> 10:16.945
I have no idea.

10:22.056 --> 10:25.822
Dad, the weirdest thing
happened at school today.

10:26.661 --> 10:28.629
I think Ms. Kunkle actually...

10:28.696 --> 10:31.392
- Smiled.
- Is that so?

10:31.466 --> 10:35.368
Some thought it was a trick of the light,
and I had my money on a gas bubble.

10:36.137 --> 10:38.332
Did she seem okay
when you talked to her last night?

10:38.440 --> 10:41.932
Karen? Yeah, she seemed fine.
And later at coffee...

10:42.010 --> 10:45.309
Whoa! You and Kunkle had coffee?
You're kidding.

10:47.015 --> 10:48.846
And an apple crumbly.

10:49.017 --> 10:50.780
I can't believe it.

10:51.119 --> 10:53.883
You went all fruit funny
and now Ms. Kunkle is...

10:54.989 --> 10:56.081
Smiling.

10:56.291 --> 10:59.317
Really? I didn't do anything
but talk with her.

11:00.028 --> 11:02.326
But I was having a pretty good hair day.

11:03.398 --> 11:07.334
Wait a minute. If after a half hour
with you and your hair she's smiling,

11:07.569 --> 11:10.561
imagine what she'd be like
after a real date with you.

11:12.941 --> 11:14.408
Now, class,

11:14.509 --> 11:18.468
the best way to learn about
the wave particle theory of physics is...

11:20.114 --> 11:23.174
To catch some gnarly waves!

11:26.154 --> 11:29.385
Come on, Kunkle-cakes!
Surf's up, baby!

11:30.692 --> 11:33.217
Coming, hunky-monkey!

11:33.294 --> 11:37.594
- Does this mean I get an A?
- This means everybody gets an A!

11:37.665 --> 11:39.428
Cowabunga!

11:41.836 --> 11:44.304
Jackson! Jackson! Jackson!

11:49.878 --> 11:50.867
Jackson?

11:53.314 --> 11:54.508
- Jackson?
- Huh?

11:55.750 --> 11:58.150
Sorry, Dad. Uh, so when
are you going to see her again?

11:58.219 --> 12:01.382
- We never talked about it.
- Well, get on it, Romeo!

12:01.456 --> 12:04.619
It's time to runkle with the...
Karen Kunkle, please.

12:04.692 --> 12:06.853
But, Jackson, don't you dare...
Hello, Karen.

12:06.961 --> 12:10.829
- Uh, yeah, this is Robbie Stewart.
- Work it, Dad, work it.

12:12.000 --> 12:18.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

12:20.642 --> 12:22.769
I got a bad feeling about this.

12:23.511 --> 12:26.537
Come on, we'll just stay long enough
for Jake to see me with Willis

12:26.614 --> 12:28.673
and then we'll be out of here.
No problem.

12:28.750 --> 12:29.978
I don't see Willis.

12:30.051 --> 12:32.713
Just look for a bunch of cool older guys.

12:38.560 --> 12:40.994
Hey, Miley! Hi!

12:41.062 --> 12:43.223
Hey, Willis. Who's this?

12:43.298 --> 12:44.526
My best friend, Mike.

12:44.632 --> 12:46.691
It's that girl I was talking to you about.
What do you think?

12:47.201 --> 12:48.828
Hubba-hubba.

12:51.839 --> 12:54.706
Best friend? How old is he?

12:54.776 --> 12:57.939
I know, I know.
He looks 10, but he's really 12.

12:59.514 --> 13:02.813
Uh, isn't it weird hanging out
with guys so much younger than you?

13:03.518 --> 13:06.453
Well, truth is,

13:06.554 --> 13:07.816
Mike's older than me.

13:09.624 --> 13:12.115
- How old are you?
- Eleven.

13:12.660 --> 13:13.752
And three-quarters.

13:13.828 --> 13:16.160
- You're 11?
- And three-quarters.

13:17.765 --> 13:19.164
What you talking about, Willis?

13:23.671 --> 13:26.640
- How can you be 11?
- And three-quarters.

13:28.042 --> 13:29.134
Not helping!

13:30.445 --> 13:33.937
- And take that giraffe off your head.
- It's a dragon.

13:34.048 --> 13:36.141
Who cares? It's a balloon hat.

13:37.218 --> 13:40.779
Look on the bright side,
she can baby-sit him for extra money.

13:42.390 --> 13:44.551
- You said you were graduating!
- I am.

13:44.626 --> 13:45.991
Elementary school!

13:47.528 --> 13:50.588
Sorry. I thought it'd be cool
to be at the party with...

13:51.232 --> 13:53.598
You know, an older babe.

13:54.469 --> 13:56.630
I can't believe you used me!

13:58.072 --> 14:01.064
You mean, just like you used him?

14:01.142 --> 14:03.736
Okay, fine. I used him.

14:03.845 --> 14:06.575
It was wrong, I learned my lesson
and I'll never do it again.

14:06.681 --> 14:08.114
- Jake alert.
- Right after this.

14:08.182 --> 14:11.515
- Quick, put your arm around me.
- Wow. I'm touching shoulder.

14:11.586 --> 14:15.113
Willis, come on, they're cutting
the cake! It's shaped like a castle!

14:15.189 --> 14:17.555
- In a minute.
- Well, you better hurry up

14:17.625 --> 14:19.217
if you want any of the pudding moat.

14:19.327 --> 14:20.385
Pudding moat?

14:23.097 --> 14:25.998
Remember when you used to like cake
more than girls?

14:26.067 --> 14:29.594
Yeah. Kids.

14:30.838 --> 14:33.136
- Oh, just go get some.
- Maybe just a taste.

14:37.745 --> 14:40.179
All right, Lilly, quick.
Let's get out of here before...

14:40.281 --> 14:41.976
Hey, Lilly.

14:42.083 --> 14:43.778
Miley?

14:44.352 --> 14:45.683
Hello.

14:47.388 --> 14:51.154
Isn't that your senior boyfriend
over there?

14:53.394 --> 14:55.862
No, that kid just looks like him.

14:56.164 --> 14:58.223
I am King Willis!

14:58.299 --> 14:59.857
And has the same name.

15:01.269 --> 15:02.896
- Hi, Miley.
- And knows me.

15:09.911 --> 15:13.108
- Dad, what are you doing?
- What does it look like I'm doing?

15:13.181 --> 15:15.843
Thanks to you,
I'm cooking Chicken à la Kunkle.

15:17.018 --> 15:18.679
At least take off the apron.

15:18.753 --> 15:20.516
You can't have a woman over for a date

15:20.588 --> 15:24.115
looking like you just got off
the late shift at the Waffle Wagon.

15:25.126 --> 15:26.388
It's not a date, Son.

15:26.461 --> 15:29.453
It's two adults having dinner
because one adult's son

15:29.564 --> 15:31.191
hoodwinked him into it.

15:31.666 --> 15:32.997
All right. Whatever you say.

15:35.837 --> 15:37.099
Just walk through that.

15:39.140 --> 15:41.472
- I don't think so.
- Dad.

15:41.876 --> 15:46.040
Get that skunk water away from
my chicken! What's wrong with you?

15:46.581 --> 15:49.482
Would you just work with me
a little bit here, Dad?

15:49.550 --> 15:52.485
Now tilt your nose up,
it's time to trim the jungle.

15:52.687 --> 15:55.178
Keep that weed whacker away from me!

15:56.758 --> 15:58.350
Oh, man, she's here.

15:58.426 --> 16:00.257
At least... yoosh!

16:02.063 --> 16:04.054
I wouldn't do that
even if I knew what it meant.

16:10.671 --> 16:13.640
- Hello, Jackson.
- Ms. Kunkle, come on in.

16:13.708 --> 16:16.939
Karen. Orange you a sight
for sore eyes.

16:17.044 --> 16:20.070
Oh, Robbie, you are so punny!

16:24.118 --> 16:27.110
- Smells incredible.
- And it tastes even better.

16:28.389 --> 16:31.358
Mmm. Wonderful.

16:31.425 --> 16:34.519
But I think it could use
just a dash of tarragon.

16:35.830 --> 16:36.854
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

16:36.964 --> 16:40.798
We got a, uh,
pretty delicate balance of spices here.

16:41.068 --> 16:44.037
Wouldn't want to throw it out of whack,
but thanks for the thought.

16:44.105 --> 16:46.266
Well, I'm just talking about a dash.

16:46.440 --> 16:48.067
I'm a pretty fair cook myself, you know.

16:48.176 --> 16:51.907
That may be, but this recipe's
been in the family for generations.

16:52.013 --> 16:54.880
Well, that doesn't mean
it can't be improved.

16:56.017 --> 17:00.511
Uh, it was good enough
to take second place

17:00.588 --> 17:02.954
for Recipe of the Year
at the Tennessee State Fair.

17:03.057 --> 17:06.617
Well, maybe if it had a dash
of tarragon, it would've won.

17:08.563 --> 17:09.587
Hey, now, hey.

17:09.696 --> 17:11.994
Let's not forget
about the apple crumbly.

17:12.098 --> 17:13.760
Good times, good times.

17:14.669 --> 17:18.605
Well, I remember the apple because
someone else ate all of the crumbly.

17:18.673 --> 17:22.006
And it was delicious because
it didn't have any tarragon in it.

17:22.076 --> 17:24.442
Hey, hey, who wants to get a pizza?

17:24.512 --> 17:27.878
They actually put cheese
in the crust now. Mmm.

17:28.716 --> 17:32.413
You know, everybody's
entitled to their opinion.

17:32.820 --> 17:36.984
But in this case, yours is wronger
than a monkey driving a lawn mower!

17:41.963 --> 17:46.764
Well, my opinion couldn't be any
wronger than your grammar, cowboy.

17:46.834 --> 17:51.794
Oh, pshaw, what's a dash of tarragon
between friends?

17:52.139 --> 17:53.333
Okay, that's it.

17:53.407 --> 17:55.967
The next one that says tarragon
is going to be gone.

17:57.378 --> 17:58.436
Tarragon.

18:01.449 --> 18:02.575
Tarragon.

18:04.652 --> 18:06.950
Tarra... I am so gone!

18:08.856 --> 18:10.448
Dad, what about my A?

18:10.858 --> 18:12.917
Oh, now I see what you're up to.

18:13.728 --> 18:15.389
Son, I'm sorry,

18:16.364 --> 18:18.730
but if you want good grades
you're going to have to earn them.

18:18.799 --> 18:21.097
What kind of a father are you?

18:23.337 --> 18:24.827
Wait a minute, I can save this!

18:24.939 --> 18:27.271
Ms. Kunkle! Ms. Kunkle, wait!

18:27.808 --> 18:30.038
Ms. Kunkle, come back!

18:30.144 --> 18:33.045
You guys make such a great pear!

18:34.515 --> 18:36.710
Turn around! I'm holding a pear!

18:38.419 --> 18:39.511
It's punny!

18:44.725 --> 18:46.488
Oh, great. There's Jake.

18:46.894 --> 18:49.328
You're going to have to face him
sooner or later.

18:49.397 --> 18:50.659
I choose later.

18:51.999 --> 18:54.524
All right, fine.
But I can hear him already.

18:54.602 --> 18:57.230
"Hey, Miley. What are you and Willis
doing tomorrow night?

18:57.338 --> 19:00.136
"Hot date on the teeter-totter?"

19:04.612 --> 19:07.206
Looks like he wanted to
try it out on them first.

19:07.281 --> 19:09.806
I guess I do deserve this.
I did use Willis.

19:10.184 --> 19:11.515
Boy, did you ever.

19:11.619 --> 19:14.053
It was like you had a love cold
and he was the tissue.

19:14.121 --> 19:16.419
"Willis, can I borrow you for a second?

19:19.760 --> 19:20.852
"Goodbye, Willis. "

19:23.364 --> 19:27.130
I already admitted I was wrong.
You don't have to blow my nose in it.

19:27.501 --> 19:31.164
- This is such a disaster.
- Not totally. I bowled a 280.

19:32.907 --> 19:35.569
- The bumpers were up.
- You never let me have anything.

19:37.345 --> 19:40.007
Hey, Miley. Oh, we just heard...

19:40.081 --> 19:42.413
I know. I know.
I went on a date with an 11-year-old.

19:42.483 --> 19:45.509
But in my defense,
he could totally pass for 16.

19:46.053 --> 19:48.521
- Without the balloon hat.
- Or the ninja stickers.

19:48.622 --> 19:49.646
Hey!

19:49.724 --> 19:53.490
Uh, I was just going to tell you
this funny joke Jake told us.

19:53.894 --> 19:57.091
But you going out with an 11-year-old
is so much funnier!

20:00.267 --> 20:01.700
Awkward.

20:02.870 --> 20:04.735
I'm just going to go see
what that joke was.

20:06.273 --> 20:07.934
Maybe Jake didn't tell anybody.

20:08.009 --> 20:10.807
Why wouldn't he tell anybody?
Any other boy would.

20:11.145 --> 20:12.203
I've got to find out.

20:13.447 --> 20:15.142
All right, Jake. What's going on?

20:15.216 --> 20:17.980
Why haven't you told anybody
about me and balloon boy?

20:19.487 --> 20:22.456
Why would I do that?
You seemed so miserable last night

20:22.523 --> 20:25.048
and I didn't want to make it any worse.

20:25.626 --> 20:28.925
Really? That's kind of nice.

20:30.064 --> 20:32.430
It's like I've been trying to tell you
since the beginning.

20:32.500 --> 20:35.230
- I'm really not a bad guy.
- Maybe not.

20:36.570 --> 20:39.505
Plus, I thought it was kind of cool
that you went to all that trouble

20:39.573 --> 20:40.972
just to make me jealous.

20:41.075 --> 20:44.101
Whoa, slow down there, ego boy.

20:44.178 --> 20:46.408
Why would I be trying
to make you jealous?

20:46.514 --> 20:48.004
Besides, you have a girlfriend.

20:48.115 --> 20:50.413
Holly? She's not my girlfriend.

20:50.951 --> 20:54.284
We have a movie coming out so we've
been hanging out as a publicity thing.

20:54.388 --> 20:56.822
Why didn't you tell me that before?

20:58.259 --> 21:01.319
Uh... Well, I think I, uh...

21:01.429 --> 21:03.920
Wait a minute. I know why.

21:04.031 --> 21:07.364
Because you were trying
to make me jealous.

21:09.503 --> 21:11.095
- Was not!
- Was too.

21:11.172 --> 21:14.369
- Admit it, Jake, you like me!
- No, you like me! Just say it!

21:14.475 --> 21:15.965
- No, you say it!
- No, you!

21:16.077 --> 21:17.169
No, you!

21:26.887 --> 21:29.014
I guess this means
we're kind of together.

21:29.156 --> 21:30.214
I guess it does.

21:30.291 --> 21:32.020
So, do you want to go out sometime?

21:32.093 --> 21:34.687
Or do you want to ask me
since you're the guy?

21:35.496 --> 21:37.930
Well, I don't really know how to say it.

21:38.132 --> 21:39.895
Come on, it's not that hard.

21:40.601 --> 21:43.126
Well, okay. You want to go out with me

21:43.370 --> 21:46.271
- four months from this Saturday?
- Yeah, that sounds...

21:46.340 --> 21:47.432
Huh?

21:47.942 --> 21:51.105
Frankie Muniz was going to do
this movie, and he dropped out.

21:51.178 --> 21:52.873
I fly to Romania tonight.

21:54.081 --> 21:56.982
Yeah, but you can't just leave.
You kissed me.

21:57.918 --> 22:00.614
Well, hey, it's not my fault
I got a big part in a movie.

22:00.721 --> 22:02.621
I know, but you kissed me!

22:03.624 --> 22:04.682
I know. It was great.

22:04.792 --> 22:08.626
And now I don't have to go off and
wonder what it would have been like.

22:08.829 --> 22:12.060
Yeah, it would have been awful for you
to have left without planting one on me.

22:12.133 --> 22:13.930
Exactly!

22:16.203 --> 22:18.034
So I guess it is four months.

22:18.105 --> 22:20.767
So I'm going to give you a little
something extra to remember me by.

22:22.877 --> 22:25.209
Whoa!

22:25.312 --> 22:26.939
That's how I plant one.
