NARRATOR:
on<i> Beyond Oak Island...</i>

00:04.254 --> 00:06.163
MATTY:
They have a virgin area

00:06.256 --> 00:08.924
right in the heart
of the 1715 Treasure Fleet.

00:09.009 --> 00:12.678
- At least 750 million dollars in registered silver and gold.
- (laughs)

00:12.762 --> 00:14.588
MATTY (clapping): That's what
we came here for, baby!

00:14.672 --> 00:16.089
GREG: All right, guys,
let's go find something.

00:16.182 --> 00:17.474
MATTY: You've got eyes on them?
They're on the target?

00:20.928 --> 00:23.096
JOHN B.:
It's the best find ever made

00:23.181 --> 00:25.098
in the history
of the 1715 Fleet.

00:25.183 --> 00:26.433
Wow.

00:26.526 --> 00:27.860
- GARY: Top-pocket find.
- MARTY: Top-pocket find.

00:30.280 --> 00:31.938
All the while
we were growing up,

00:32.032 --> 00:35.034
my brother and I were fascinated
with finding treasure.

00:36.369 --> 00:37.202
RICK:
Pirate treasure,

00:37.287 --> 00:38.862
cursed treasure.

00:38.946 --> 00:40.873
Civil War gold.

00:40.957 --> 00:43.784
- (laughter) - Since then,
our work on Oak Island

00:43.868 --> 00:45.961
has shown us
there's a world of mysteries...

00:46.046 --> 00:49.039
- Whoa.
- waiting to be explored.

00:49.123 --> 00:51.875
RICK: So, we like to reach
out to other treasure hunters.

00:51.968 --> 00:54.127
"X" marks the spot, right there.
Brilliant.

00:54.220 --> 00:56.388
- MARTY: We want to hear their stories...
- That's right.

00:56.547 --> 00:58.965
- and share our insights.
- "Ill-gotten gains."

00:59.050 --> 01:00.467
- RICK: And who knows...
- GARY: I got it.

01:00.551 --> 01:02.144
maybe we can help them
with their search.

01:02.228 --> 01:03.804
MARTY:
Not only in America.

01:03.897 --> 01:05.555
Wow. That is gold.

01:05.640 --> 01:07.474
- RICK: But all over the world.
- Yeah!

01:07.567 --> 01:09.068
MARTY:
<i>Beyond Oak Island.</i>

01:18.328 --> 01:19.828
MATTY: Well, thanks, guys,
for letting me call

01:19.987 --> 01:21.163
a little mini war room here.

01:21.247 --> 01:22.331
I wanted you guys to look back

01:22.490 --> 01:23.832
on all the adventures
we've been on.

01:23.917 --> 01:26.076
All the treasure hunts
we've looked into thus far.

01:26.169 --> 01:27.419
What are the ones
that you really thought,

01:27.578 --> 01:29.162
"All right,
this is our best chance

01:29.255 --> 01:31.414
to actually walk out
on the other side of this

01:31.499 --> 01:33.592
with something in our hand,
pull up some treasure"?

01:33.751 --> 01:36.753
For my part, all these forays
into other treasure hunts

01:36.846 --> 01:38.672
are very reminiscent
of my early career

01:38.756 --> 01:39.923
drilling oil and gas wells,

01:40.007 --> 01:41.842
because we're gonna drill,
I don't know,

01:41.935 --> 01:43.677
ten wells this one year,

01:43.770 --> 01:45.604
and we said, "Which ones do
you think, if you had to pick,

01:45.688 --> 01:46.939
would be the ones
that would 'hit'?"

01:47.023 --> 01:49.024
- MATTY: Mm-hmm.
- And we were never right.

01:49.109 --> 01:51.601
We were never right, you know?
A-And the point is,

01:51.694 --> 01:55.030
each of these treasure hunts
have merit

01:55.115 --> 01:57.116
- or we wouldn't have embarked on them, right?
- Absolutely.

01:57.275 --> 01:59.451
I had high hopes for
the one we did with you, Gary--

01:59.610 --> 02:02.788
The 1715 Fleet--
I really did, you know?

02:02.872 --> 02:05.374
How many stories have you
told us about walking the beach

02:05.458 --> 02:07.543
and finding this
and finding that?

02:07.702 --> 02:10.129
I-I really thought that
we were gonna pull something

02:10.288 --> 02:12.798
out of the, out of
the beach sand, I really did.

02:12.882 --> 02:14.291
Yeah, it has that feeling.

02:14.384 --> 02:16.293
I mean,
your treasure hunting chances

02:16.386 --> 02:18.554
on the Treasure Coast can
actually change

02:18.638 --> 02:22.382
on the tides from day to day.

02:22.466 --> 02:24.801
This is it, guys.
Treasure central.

02:24.886 --> 02:27.229
NARRATOR:
Early in 2021,

02:27.388 --> 02:30.807
Rick, Marty and Matty
traveled to Sebastian, Florida

02:30.900 --> 02:33.393
to help Gary Drayton
look for valuables

02:33.477 --> 02:36.980
related to the historic
1715 Treasure Fleet.

02:37.064 --> 02:38.991
- Oh, look at that color green.
- Yep.

02:39.075 --> 02:40.734
- (chuckles)
- Come on!

02:40.818 --> 02:43.328
Look at that.
That is fantastic.

02:44.247 --> 02:46.740
NARRATOR:
Encompassing 12 galleons,

02:46.824 --> 02:49.326
the Treasure Fleet set sail
from the Spanish port of Havana

02:49.410 --> 02:53.172
on July 24, 1715,

02:53.331 --> 02:56.258
carrying billions
in plundered gold, silver

02:56.342 --> 02:58.668
and precious jewels
back to Spain.

02:58.753 --> 03:00.503
But on July 31,

03:00.597 --> 03:03.682
11 of the 12 ships
were destroyed

03:03.841 --> 03:06.009
when the fleet was caught
in a massive hurricane

03:06.102 --> 03:08.937
just off the coast of Florida.

03:09.096 --> 03:13.609
JOHN D.: When the ships sailed
from Havana on the 24th of July

03:13.693 --> 03:15.360
everything went okay
for the first few days

03:15.519 --> 03:18.113
and then,
the oceans start rolling,

03:18.272 --> 03:20.115
and big swells start coming in.

03:20.200 --> 03:22.692
The pilots realized that

03:22.785 --> 03:25.787
they were gonna be in
for a big storm.

03:25.872 --> 03:27.197
- (lightning crashing)
- ROB W.: And one by one,

03:27.281 --> 03:28.949
the ships get smashed to pieces

03:29.042 --> 03:31.368
against the reefs of Florida.

03:31.461 --> 03:35.797
700 to 1,000 people died
in the initial shipwreck.

03:35.957 --> 03:38.208
More perished in the weeks
that came from starvation,

03:38.301 --> 03:39.301
and they didn't have
fresh water.

03:39.385 --> 03:41.553
The news got to Havana first.

03:41.638 --> 03:43.555
The governor sent help
immediately,

03:43.714 --> 03:46.049
and they sent salvage divers
right away.

03:46.142 --> 03:49.052
That operation lasted
for three years,

03:49.136 --> 03:51.230
and they actually were very,
very successful

03:51.389 --> 03:53.473
in recovering
a lot of the treasure.

03:53.566 --> 03:56.318
NARRATOR: Although the
Spanish were able to recover

03:56.402 --> 03:58.987
as much as two thirds
of the sunken cargo,

03:59.146 --> 04:01.731
billions in valuables remained,

04:01.824 --> 04:03.492
which generations
of treasure hunters

04:03.651 --> 04:05.661
have been salvaging ever since.

04:07.080 --> 04:10.573
Gary, who has lived in the area
and combed the beaches

04:10.658 --> 04:13.001
for more than 20 years
with his metal detecting gear,

04:13.086 --> 04:16.672
has discovered
more than $1 million in treasure

04:16.831 --> 04:18.999
that continually washes
onto shore,

04:19.092 --> 04:22.844
including a 22 and a half carat
gold and emerald ring.

04:25.172 --> 04:26.506
That's why you called us
there, right? To say, like,

04:26.599 --> 04:28.258
this is something
we can immediately make a find.

04:28.351 --> 04:30.185
Oh, yeah.
I wanted to give these guys

04:30.270 --> 04:33.105
- instant treasure hunting gratification.
- (chuckles)

04:33.264 --> 04:35.098
Uh, I was hoping
that we could find,

04:35.191 --> 04:37.434
uh, friends of "my precious."

04:37.527 --> 04:39.111
(chuckles)

04:39.195 --> 04:42.022
All it takes is
one turn of the shovel

04:42.115 --> 04:45.951
to change your fortunes
and make history as well.

04:46.035 --> 04:47.861
Well, there's a third thing,
too, Gary,

04:47.945 --> 04:49.195
about that particular trip.

04:49.289 --> 04:50.956
Had we found something--

04:51.115 --> 04:52.949
As long as you stayed
in the sand, right?

04:53.034 --> 04:54.534
Wasn't that the rule?--
You got to keep it.

04:54.627 --> 04:56.953
Do you remember,

04:57.038 --> 04:59.289
from our last trip with Gary
to his backyard,

04:59.382 --> 05:01.207
do you remember John Brandon?

05:01.301 --> 05:02.968
-Oh, very much so.
-Absolutely. How do you forget that?

05:03.052 --> 05:05.137
- (Matty chuckles)
- He of the 80-pound silver bar.

05:05.221 --> 05:07.389
-Almost gave me a hernia. Yeah. Yeah.
-MATTY: Bingo.

05:07.548 --> 05:09.891
Well, John and his team
just renewed

05:09.976 --> 05:11.885
- their salvage license.
- Okay.

05:11.969 --> 05:13.219
And they're about to embark
on their new season.

05:13.304 --> 05:14.938
That's cool.
That's really cool.

05:16.724 --> 05:19.809
NARRATOR: Having grown up on
Florida's so-called Treasure Coast,

05:19.902 --> 05:22.571
John Brandon has been diving
on the shipwrecks

05:22.655 --> 05:26.649
of the 1715 Fleet since he was
a teenager in the 1960s,

05:26.734 --> 05:28.151
when he was first hired

05:28.235 --> 05:30.653
by renowned treasure hunter
Mel Fisher.

05:30.747 --> 05:32.664
JOHN B.: One day,
when I was 13 years old,

05:32.823 --> 05:34.499
I went over to
a neighborhood friend's house,

05:34.584 --> 05:37.160
and Mel was there
with a big find of treasure

05:37.244 --> 05:38.995
they had just made off Vero.

05:39.080 --> 05:42.341
And that really got me,
uh, hooked.

05:42.500 --> 05:45.752
I actually asked, uh, Mel Fisher
for a job that day.

05:45.845 --> 05:47.754
But because I was 13,
it was one of these,

05:47.847 --> 05:49.839
"Go away, kid, you're
bothering me" kind of things.

05:49.932 --> 05:52.517
When I was 17 years old,
I'd already found

05:52.602 --> 05:56.012
hundreds of silver coins
on the beach after big storms.

05:56.097 --> 05:59.524
I'd found a number of gold coins
and a lot of artifacts.

05:59.609 --> 06:01.267
Then Mel finally hired me.

06:01.361 --> 06:04.279
Outside of his own sons,
I was the youngest person ever

06:04.364 --> 06:07.440
to captain, uh,
one of his treasure boats.

06:07.533 --> 06:11.194
NARRATOR: Even though that
company salvaged hundreds of tons

06:11.287 --> 06:14.039
in gold, silver
and jewels themselves,

06:14.123 --> 06:18.201
today, John Brandon serves
as the operations manager

06:18.285 --> 06:22.464
for the 1715 Fleet-Queens
Jewels, LLC--

06:22.623 --> 06:24.207
The entity which controls

06:24.300 --> 06:26.876
all legal salvage rights
to the wrecks.

06:28.629 --> 06:30.797
- JOHN B.: This is part of what you guys are looking for.
- RICK: Oh, yeah.

06:30.890 --> 06:32.882
NARRATOR: During their
recent search with Gary

06:32.967 --> 06:34.643
along Florida's Treasure Coast,

06:34.802 --> 06:39.055
Rick, Marty and Matty
were fascinated and intrigued

06:39.140 --> 06:41.233
by some of John's
greatest discoveries.

06:41.392 --> 06:42.984
MARTY: That is really
cool, John. Wowzer.

06:43.144 --> 06:44.644
And the gold shines forever.

06:44.728 --> 06:46.062
They came off the bottom
of the ocean

06:46.147 --> 06:47.897
looking just like that.

06:48.908 --> 06:53.495
John has told me that
they have a virgin area,

06:53.579 --> 06:56.665
unsearched, in the ocean
off the coast,

06:56.749 --> 06:59.918
right in the heart of
the 1715 Spanish Treasure Fleet.

07:00.077 --> 07:02.337
And he says, "I don't get
excited about things.

07:02.496 --> 07:03.913
I'm excited about this one."

07:03.998 --> 07:05.924
Well, he clearly knows
what he's doing, John Brandon.

07:06.083 --> 07:08.001
- Yes.
- I mean, he's a very interesting guy.

07:08.094 --> 07:10.587
Well, he's actually standing by
if you'd like to talk to him.

07:10.680 --> 07:12.589
I'd love to.
Let's talk to him again.

07:12.673 --> 07:13.840
Let's go back
to the Treasure Coast.

07:13.933 --> 07:15.016
MARTY:
Yeah, excellent.

07:17.178 --> 07:18.511
- MARTY and RICK: Hello, John.
- Hey, John. - Hello, mate.

07:18.604 --> 07:20.180
<i>Hi, guys, how are you doing?</i>

07:20.273 --> 07:21.440
Good. How are you?

07:21.524 --> 07:23.608
- Hanging in there.
- (chuckles)

07:23.693 --> 07:26.102
We've heard better tales
than that.

07:26.187 --> 07:27.612
- Yeah. You're doing a lot better than that. Come on.
<i>- (Laughs)</i>

07:27.771 --> 07:29.939
<i>We're doing pretty good.
We're doing pretty good.</i>

07:30.024 --> 07:32.942
We're looking forward to
an exciting season out there

07:33.035 --> 07:35.195
on the 1715 Fleet shipwrecks.

07:35.279 --> 07:38.698
We've got, uh,
about 18 different vessels

07:38.782 --> 07:40.959
that'll be out there
combing the waters,

07:41.118 --> 07:43.962
<i>so we're looking forward
to having a good summer.</i>

07:44.121 --> 07:45.797
<i>Uh, if we can get
the right kind of weather</i>

07:45.956 --> 07:47.874
<i>and everything goes right,
we hope we'll make</i>

07:47.967 --> 07:51.377
<i>- some interesting finds.</i>
- John, you mentioned to me,

07:51.471 --> 07:54.047
uh, there's some new ground
that you're excited about.

07:54.131 --> 07:55.390
Can you tell us about that?

07:55.475 --> 07:58.218
<i>Yeah, we've got, um, a guy,</i>

07:58.302 --> 08:01.980
<i>uh, Captain Greg Bounds,
an historical shipwreck salver.</i>

08:02.139 --> 08:04.816
<i>He's worked on
numerous shipwrecks and found</i>

08:04.901 --> 08:08.061
a lot of treasure
on the 1715 Fleet.

08:08.145 --> 08:12.065
He's been doing a very detailed
magnetometer survey

08:12.158 --> 08:15.744
<i>of one of the principal ships
in the 1715 Fleet.</i>

08:15.903 --> 08:19.581
<i>Now he's got an area mapped out
of magnetometer targets</i>

08:19.665 --> 08:21.416
<i>in totally virgin territory</i>

08:21.575 --> 08:26.079
<i>that we're setting up to,
uh, go out and excavate.</i>

08:26.172 --> 08:29.007
<i>The targets he has now
look very, very promising.</i>

08:29.091 --> 08:31.676
It's very exciting, uh,
the possibilities are endless.

08:31.761 --> 08:34.170
Rick is always talking about
connect the dots,

08:34.255 --> 08:35.922
connect the dots.
You've connected the dots.

08:36.006 --> 08:38.183
The only thing that remains is
to go look, right?

08:38.342 --> 08:39.425
<i>That's it exactly.</i>

08:39.510 --> 08:40.769
Absolutely.

08:40.853 --> 08:42.345
Okay, switching topics, John.

08:42.429 --> 08:44.105
What percent did you feel

08:44.190 --> 08:48.193
of that 1715 treasure
has been recovered?

08:48.352 --> 08:51.020
<i>We know from
the historical documentation</i>

08:51.113 --> 08:53.022
that the Spanish were
very successful

08:53.107 --> 08:54.115
in their recovery efforts

08:54.275 --> 08:55.775
<i>on the 1715 Fleet wrecks.</i>

08:55.859 --> 08:59.621
<i>They recovered about 80%</i>

08:59.780 --> 09:02.448
<i>of the registered silver coins
that had gone to the bottom,</i>

09:02.533 --> 09:05.618
<i>but there's still
many tons of coins</i>

09:05.703 --> 09:06.786
<i>that are left out there.</i>

09:06.879 --> 09:08.713
Let's say 20% was left

09:08.798 --> 09:11.883
after Spain did
its recovery efforts.

09:11.968 --> 09:13.793
Of that 20%,
how much do you think

09:13.886 --> 09:15.461
modern-day people have found?

09:15.555 --> 09:17.472
How much is still out there,
is what I'm trying to get at.

09:17.557 --> 09:20.392
I would estimate that probably

09:20.476 --> 09:23.895
between 750 million
and one billion dollars' worth

09:23.980 --> 09:25.471
of treasure
still remains to be found

09:25.565 --> 09:28.641
<i>in modern times
on the 1715 Fleet wrecks.</i>

09:28.726 --> 09:31.060
- RICK: Wow.
- MARTY: We're gonna have to arm wrestle

09:31.153 --> 09:33.738
about who gets to go on this.
(laughs)

09:33.897 --> 09:35.982
If I said, "Ready, set, go.
Raise your arm,

09:36.066 --> 09:37.817
and the first guy
that raises his arm wins,"

09:37.910 --> 09:39.569
I think it'd be a tie.

09:39.662 --> 09:41.237
- (laughter)
- Because we're all...

09:41.322 --> 09:44.574
we're all enthused and
we're all interested in going,

09:44.667 --> 09:47.085
but Matty's our eyes
and boots guy.

09:47.169 --> 09:51.172
Marty and I, unfortunately--
Or maybe fortunately--

09:51.257 --> 09:54.584
We, uh, have a lot of work
to do here on Oak Island,

09:54.668 --> 09:56.177
but for right now I think

09:56.262 --> 09:58.263
Matty will carry the torch
forward for us.

09:58.422 --> 10:01.516
Uh, he'll report back to us,
and I-I think at some point

10:01.601 --> 10:03.509
we'll take you up
on that invite.

10:03.603 --> 10:06.938
Uh, Matty, uh, come down here
and bring us a little luck.

10:07.097 --> 10:09.432
I can't wait to see you do
what you do in person,

10:09.516 --> 10:10.850
so I'll coordinate with you
the details, okay, John?

10:10.943 --> 10:12.518
That sounds excellent.

10:12.603 --> 10:13.695
John, thanks for sharing
all of that with us.

10:13.854 --> 10:15.104
- Much appreciated.
- Yeah.

10:15.189 --> 10:16.948

NARRATOR: Three days
after his meeting

10:24.782 --> 10:27.200
with the Laginas and
Gary Drayton on Oak Island,

10:27.293 --> 10:30.378
Matty Blake has traveled
to Sebastian, Florida

10:30.537 --> 10:34.374
some 90 miles
southeast of Orlando.

10:34.458 --> 10:36.384
John, good to see you again.

10:36.469 --> 10:37.710
It's good to be back
on the Treasure Coast.

10:37.795 --> 10:39.304
- Welcome aboard.
- NARRATOR: At the headquarters

10:39.463 --> 10:43.549
of the 1715 Fleet-Queens Jewels,
LLC,

10:43.643 --> 10:46.978
Matty is meeting with
operations manager John Brandon

10:47.137 --> 10:50.723
in preparation to join a search
for some $1 billion

10:50.808 --> 10:52.567
in sunken Spanish treasure.

10:52.726 --> 10:54.319
This is our lab here

10:54.403 --> 10:56.229
where we, uh,
bring the artifacts

10:56.322 --> 10:57.822
and the things that are found
out there in the ocean,

10:57.907 --> 10:59.482
for conservation purposes.

10:59.575 --> 11:01.159
Hopefully,
over the next couple of days

11:01.318 --> 11:03.820
when we are out with Greg,
he'll make some finds,

11:03.904 --> 11:05.571
and we'll be bringing them
back here to, uh,

11:05.656 --> 11:07.156
to do the conservation work.

11:07.241 --> 11:09.992
Here's a copy of, uh,
our-our log books

11:10.086 --> 11:11.661
that all the boats fill out
out there.

11:11.745 --> 11:12.837
It's a computer database.

11:12.996 --> 11:15.090
Last year,
you can see they were finding

11:15.174 --> 11:18.343
quite a bit of material,
every item is tagged.

11:18.427 --> 11:20.837
You can see when they turn it in
I put my initials,

11:20.930 --> 11:22.505
and then as I process
the material

11:22.598 --> 11:24.340
through conservation
and recording

11:24.425 --> 11:27.260
- and all that stuff, I put an X by it.
- So cool.

11:27.353 --> 11:30.096
There's so many things. I mean,
look at all the silver coins.

11:30.180 --> 11:32.774
JOHN B.: A lot of coins.
Uh, you've got silver coins.

11:32.858 --> 11:35.601
- This is just last summer.
- What's our target today?

11:35.686 --> 11:37.696
What's the actual target?
Like, can you show me

11:37.855 --> 11:40.022
what we are actually
gonna dive on today?

11:40.116 --> 11:41.607
Yeah, most people think of
a shipwreck

11:41.701 --> 11:44.026
- as it hit the rocks and sank in a pile.
- Right.

11:44.120 --> 11:45.695
The captain is still
at the wheel.

11:45.788 --> 11:47.530
Yeah, you think of the big, uh,
stern going down.

11:47.614 --> 11:49.115
- Exactly, exactly.
- Yeah.

11:49.208 --> 11:51.459
And again, when these wrecks
hit the reefs

11:51.544 --> 11:53.878
they just scattered
over huge, vast areas of, uh,

11:53.963 --> 11:55.630
of ocean bottom.

11:55.715 --> 11:57.707
And this is, uh, just south
of where we're going today

11:57.791 --> 11:59.384
with Greg Bounds.

11:59.468 --> 12:01.720
NARRATOR:
Over the past year,

12:01.804 --> 12:03.972
John's colleague,
Captain Greg Bounds,

12:04.056 --> 12:06.466
has conducted
an extensive search

12:06.550 --> 12:10.353
for the scattered remains of
the 1715 Spanish Treasure Fleet.

12:11.564 --> 12:13.055
Using a magnetometer,

12:13.149 --> 12:16.309
which deploys
electromagnetic pulses,

12:16.402 --> 12:19.070
a number of large ferrous--
Or iron-- objects

12:19.155 --> 12:22.157
have been identified
for further investigation.

12:22.316 --> 12:25.067
GREG:
I towed this magnetometer

12:25.161 --> 12:27.829
over 1,000 linear miles
back and forth

12:27.913 --> 12:31.073
on a two-square-mile area
in front of this wreck site,

12:31.167 --> 12:33.001
just to get
the highest resolution

12:33.085 --> 12:35.661
of how the ship is dispersed
across the sea floor.

12:35.755 --> 12:38.080
So, what this mag survey's done,

12:38.174 --> 12:40.917
it's given me
a true treasure map.

12:41.001 --> 12:43.261
The wreck came in here,

12:43.420 --> 12:45.847
first hit and lost some material
out in this water...

12:45.931 --> 12:49.342
NARRATOR: Based on Greg's
initial magnetometer survey,

12:49.435 --> 12:52.187
the team will be diving
on a possible debris field

12:52.346 --> 12:54.847
of wreckage from the 1715 Fleet

12:54.932 --> 12:57.350
that has not been explored
in the modern era

12:57.443 --> 13:01.196
and could potentially contain
millions in scattered treasure.

13:02.448 --> 13:05.116
All the blue dots are silver.

13:05.275 --> 13:07.860
All of the red dots like that
are-are gold.

13:07.945 --> 13:10.530
- No way.
- Um, we're looking for any dispersal patterns

13:10.614 --> 13:12.791
within that debris field that
might lead us to the treasure.

13:12.875 --> 13:16.702
Here's a gold coin
off the 1715 Fleet.

13:16.787 --> 13:19.288
- May I? (groans) - The gold
comes up shining just like that.

13:19.373 --> 13:23.468
The silver coins become
encrusted through sulfiding

13:23.627 --> 13:25.711
and seashells and things
will stick to them.

13:25.796 --> 13:27.972
But that's the kind of items
that we're gonna be looking for

13:28.057 --> 13:29.474
out there today with Greg.

13:29.633 --> 13:31.976
Wow. Let's go find
some treasure.

- JOHN B.: A whole pile.

14:06.262 --> 14:07.428
I think if there's not
a pile of gold,

14:07.588 --> 14:09.097
they're gonna make me
swim back to the docks,

14:09.256 --> 14:10.682

14:12.342 --> 14:14.427
get into this
because you liked fishing.

14:14.520 --> 14:15.937
I mean, this is about treasure,
right, at the end of the day?

14:16.021 --> 14:18.180
-Exactly.
-It's about treasure. That's right.

14:18.265 --> 14:21.693
There's tremendous quantities of
treasure that's still out there.

14:21.852 --> 14:25.697
We conservatively estimate
at least $750 million

14:25.856 --> 14:28.274
- in registered silver and gold.
- (chuckles)

why we're out here?

14:45.792 --> 14:47.302
How about any safety issues?

14:47.386 --> 14:48.878
- Anything like that to be aware of?
- Well, you know,

14:48.962 --> 14:50.379
weather can change at any time.

14:50.464 --> 14:52.214
This is one of
the most dangerous inlets

14:52.299 --> 14:54.216
on Florida's coast,
so we got to be careful.

14:54.310 --> 14:55.810
The tides change, and they-- if
they're a little bit of swell,

14:55.895 --> 14:57.386
it can stand the waves right up,

14:57.479 --> 14:59.063
so we got to be careful
for that.

What we came here for, baby.

15:10.409 --> 15:13.578
What's most exciting is,
this is virgin territory.

15:13.737 --> 15:16.989
And it's kind of outside
where they believed

15:17.074 --> 15:19.667
the 1715 Spanish Treasure Fleet
was wrecked.

15:19.752 --> 15:23.079
If it's period, that's
the 1715 Spanish Treasure Fleet,

15:23.163 --> 15:25.831
and that's a new site
in a new area.

15:25.925 --> 15:27.425

15:29.678 --> 15:32.505
All right, fellas.
We got to set our anchors here.

15:32.598 --> 15:34.840
So, walk me through that, John.
What's he doing right now?

15:34.925 --> 15:37.101
He's getting ready to run out
one of the stern anchors,

15:37.186 --> 15:39.595
and he's gonna use that whaler.
He's gonna take off in a minute,

15:39.680 --> 15:41.430
and that line's gonna go
shooting out of

15:41.523 --> 15:43.024

- MATTY: There he goes.
- JOHN B.: There he goes.

15:44.944 --> 15:47.103
So, he's actually pulling it out
to where they want it?

15:47.187 --> 15:48.863
JOHN B.: So now he's, now
he's pulling the stern anchor out.

15:49.022 --> 15:51.199
And when Chas gets in position,

15:51.283 --> 15:53.409
he'll wave his arms,
and Chas will drop the anchor.

15:54.695 --> 15:56.287
MATTY:
Ah, there he goes.

15:57.623 --> 16:00.032
NARRATOR: Before
the divers enter the water,

the boat's engine wash
is redirected downward,

19:08.138 --> 19:09.889
Do you see the object
they're working on?

19:09.973 --> 19:12.316
Have they pulled anything out?
What's it look like? What shape?

19:27.166 --> 19:29.909
All right, so we're
getting targets, that's great.

19:29.993 --> 19:33.495
We have documented fact,

19:33.580 --> 19:37.091
1715 Treasure Fleet went down
in this area,

19:37.176 --> 19:40.094
and we know that these ships had
hundreds and hundreds

19:40.253 --> 19:42.513
of millions of dollars,
perhaps billions of dollars,

19:42.672 --> 19:44.515
worth of gold, silver
and treasure on them.

19:44.674 --> 19:47.268
That's a fact,
so you're not hunting

19:47.352 --> 19:49.437
for some mysterious,
nebulous thing.

19:49.521 --> 19:50.688
You know there's treasure
in these waters.

19:50.772 --> 19:52.348
Diver's coming up.

19:52.432 --> 19:53.941
Let's just hope
it's something good.

19:55.352 --> 19:56.936
MATTY: There's a part
of the ship right there.

19:57.020 --> 19:59.697
I hope. Look at this.

20:01.366 --> 20:03.609
- Oh, I'll tell you what it is.
- What?

20:03.693 --> 20:05.119
This is an iron ring.

20:05.204 --> 20:06.621
It would have come up like this.

20:06.705 --> 20:08.789
And this iron ring would have
come up here

20:08.874 --> 20:10.616
for a rope to run through it.

20:10.700 --> 20:11.784
And it definitely looks
like it's period.

20:11.868 --> 20:12.710
- Ah, yes.
- I mean, definitely looks like

20:12.794 --> 20:14.787
it's from the wreck.

20:14.871 --> 20:16.455
- This piece would be into the hull of the boat.
- Into the ship.

20:16.548 --> 20:18.624
Then probably exit
a piece of wood in here

20:18.708 --> 20:20.292
- because it would chafe and break.
- Right.

20:20.385 --> 20:22.887
They're starting to bring up
those pieces.

20:22.971 --> 20:24.639
Looks like a hammer.

20:24.723 --> 20:26.224
That looks more typical of a...

20:26.383 --> 20:27.391
- Spike. Yeah.
- of a ship's spike.

20:28.727 --> 20:30.728
But it definitely looks
like period material.

20:30.887 --> 20:32.230
Yeah, we're definitely
finding that debris.

20:32.389 --> 20:34.065
JOHN B.: It looks
good. It looks really good.

20:35.817 --> 20:36.984
MATTY: Well, yeah,
it's always described as--

20:37.143 --> 20:38.394
The night of that storm,
right?--

20:38.478 --> 20:40.479
We say, like,
the ships literally got

20:40.572 --> 20:43.741
blown apart into pieces,
and we're pulling up pieces.

20:43.900 --> 20:45.743
♪ ♪

20:49.498 --> 20:51.749
Got another interesting piece.

20:51.833 --> 20:53.334
Oh, wow. Look at that.

20:53.418 --> 20:55.086
JOHN B.:
Yep, a large ship's pin.

20:55.245 --> 20:56.754
RIC: Yeah, that
looks like a large pin.

20:56.838 --> 20:59.173
NARRATOR: After
finding three large artifacts

20:59.258 --> 21:03.252
potentially connected
to the 1715 Treasure Fleet...

21:03.336 --> 21:06.013
- Can almost see the heads.
- John Brandon and the team have good reason to believe

21:06.172 --> 21:09.767
they're getting closer to
the millions in gold and silver

21:09.926 --> 21:12.436
that may still lie
scattered nearby.

21:13.847 --> 21:16.691
So, uh, when I got to the
bottom, the viz was--

21:16.775 --> 21:19.443
I'm gonna estimate--
About five feet.

21:19.528 --> 21:22.938
- The artifacts are penetrated down into that shell and clay.
- Okay.

21:23.023 --> 21:25.024
A couple of them,
the shell's so hard, you know.

21:25.117 --> 21:27.118
You can't even get your fingers
into it to dig around it,

21:27.277 --> 21:29.361
so I needed the knife
just to poke holes.

21:29.454 --> 21:32.197
They look like ship material,
ship pins and things,

21:32.282 --> 21:34.208
-so it's, uh, it's a good sign. Yeah.
-GREG: It looks good.

21:34.293 --> 21:36.869
JOHN B.: When you do an
excavation and find something,

21:36.962 --> 21:39.288
even if it's only
a single iron ship's spike,

21:39.372 --> 21:41.123
but it's something that
you're fairly certain is

21:41.207 --> 21:42.624
from the wreck,

21:42.718 --> 21:44.376
then that level of excitement
goes up,

21:44.461 --> 21:45.803
because you know you're close.

21:45.962 --> 21:47.463
You know you're in
the debris field.

21:47.556 --> 21:49.381
So it's very, very exciting.

21:49.466 --> 21:51.142
And that'll lead you
to the major finds.

21:54.563 --> 21:56.230
Wind's picking up a little bit.
It's starting to get choppy,

21:56.315 --> 21:59.725
so this might be our last dive.
So, uh, give it hell.

21:59.809 --> 22:01.068
MATTY:
Go get 'em.

22:08.735 --> 22:09.827
Copy that.

22:20.922 --> 22:23.174
That's not what we wanted
to hear, fellas.

22:23.258 --> 22:26.585
NARRATOR: Although the team
has made great progress so far,

22:26.678 --> 22:28.253
continued diving

22:28.338 --> 22:31.015
in the deteriorating
visibility conditions

22:31.174 --> 22:34.518
could lead to danger
rather than good fortune.

22:34.677 --> 22:36.595
With the weather picking up
a little bit,

22:36.679 --> 22:38.773
it's about to come off shore.

22:38.932 --> 22:40.858
It's probably better if we, uh,
play it safe and head in.

22:40.942 --> 22:45.029
NARRATOR: Weather permitting, the
search will have to continue tomorrow.

22:45.188 --> 22:46.188
So, we got to call
this one short,

22:46.281 --> 22:48.357
but I am really encouraged

22:48.450 --> 22:50.117
by the finds that they made.

22:50.276 --> 22:52.611
Uh, the fact that we pulled up
anything out of the water,

22:52.695 --> 22:54.196
never mind things
that look like they're

22:54.289 --> 22:55.456
part of the Treasure Fleet.

22:55.540 --> 22:57.449
I'm really ready to go tomorrow.

22:57.534 --> 22:58.959
- Great job.
- Tomorrow's the day.

22:59.044 --> 22:59.877
All right, tomorrow's the day.

23:07.803 --> 23:10.379
MARTY: Guys, while we're here
laboring away on Oak Island,

23:10.463 --> 23:12.556
Matty Blake is in Florida

23:12.715 --> 23:15.217
looking for treasure
in your favorite place.

23:15.301 --> 23:17.719
- Oh, blimey. Oh, to be there.
- (laughs)

23:17.804 --> 23:19.471
I mean, I always equate
metal detecting

23:19.556 --> 23:22.233
on the Treasure Coast
of Florida as like

23:22.317 --> 23:24.735
you're metal detecting
outside the jewelry store,

23:24.894 --> 23:27.896
- but Matty is actually in the jewelry store.
- He's in the jewelry store.

23:27.989 --> 23:29.565
That's a good analogy Gary.

23:29.649 --> 23:31.826
Let's get him up
and let's see how he's doing.

23:33.495 --> 23:35.663
- Hello, Matty Blake.
- Hey, Matty.

23:35.822 --> 23:38.490
- Hello, my mate from another state.
<i>- Hey, guys.</i>

23:38.583 --> 23:41.168
Greetings from
the Treasure Coast in Florida.

23:41.253 --> 23:42.837
So, Matty. How are you doing?

23:42.921 --> 23:45.172
I'm doing great.
Uh, it's great to be back.

23:45.257 --> 23:46.674
Gary, it's a little weird being

23:46.758 --> 23:49.501
in your stomping grounds
without you, but, uh,

23:49.586 --> 23:50.511
<i>I think you're gonna be
impressed with</i>

23:50.595 --> 23:51.929
<i>what we're coming up with here.</i>

23:52.013 --> 23:54.181
Right, so, Matty,
what's going on down there?

23:54.266 --> 23:56.267
<i>Incredible day today, you know,</i>

23:56.426 --> 23:57.676
<i>this team knows
what they're doing.</i>

23:57.760 --> 23:59.937
<i>The magnetometer guys
had indicated</i>

24:00.096 --> 24:02.273
<i>what they believed to be
a debris field,</i>

24:02.357 --> 24:05.934
<i>which is exciting when you're
looking for the 1715 Fleet.</i>

24:06.019 --> 24:07.853
<i>That's exactly
the type of imaging you want.</i>

24:07.946 --> 24:09.688
<i>It was also really cool
tech-wise, guys,</i>

24:09.781 --> 24:11.857
to see the map
that the captain was using.

24:11.941 --> 24:13.442
You know, he's got a monitor

24:13.526 --> 24:15.786
<i>right on the boat,
and you can literally see</i>

24:15.871 --> 24:17.788
<i>where the boat is
being positioned, live time,</i>

24:17.873 --> 24:20.040
to the target--
Super impressive.

24:20.200 --> 24:21.783
<i>It's quite extraordinary.</i>

24:21.868 --> 24:24.620
So, Matty, question is,
what're they finding?

24:24.713 --> 24:27.047
<i>They brought up artifacts.</i>

24:27.132 --> 24:29.708
And what they brought up today
was really exciting.

24:29.792 --> 24:30.792
They were bringing up

24:30.877 --> 24:32.294
<i>parts of a ship,</i>

24:32.378 --> 24:34.889
very old parts of a ship,
they believe.

24:36.224 --> 24:37.966
<i>When you think about it,
I'm the second human being</i>

24:38.051 --> 24:42.054
to hold one of these items
in over 300 hundred years.

24:42.138 --> 24:44.389
Um, that's hallowed ground.

24:44.474 --> 24:46.391
That's brilliant, Matty.

24:46.476 --> 24:47.985
Look, I'd like to do that
here on Oak Island.

24:48.144 --> 24:49.561
- We think we have ship parts.
- GARY: Yep.

24:49.654 --> 24:53.157
But he has 1715 Fleet
ship parts. That's pretty cool.

24:53.241 --> 24:55.242
<i>This was exciting.</i>

24:55.327 --> 24:57.244
<i>This was, uh, a successful dive.</i>

24:57.329 --> 24:58.820
<i>It's pretty cool to work
with a team</i>

24:58.905 --> 25:01.665
<i>that has actually pulled up
gold and silver.</i>

25:01.750 --> 25:03.584
Oh, that hurt.

25:03.743 --> 25:06.578
<i>No offense. (stammers)
I didn't mean it like that,</i>

25:06.671 --> 25:08.497
<i>(chuckles):
I did not mean it like that.</i>

25:08.590 --> 25:09.840
<i>But hey, no, it-it's true.</i>

25:09.925 --> 25:11.425
<i>They have the advantage,
however,</i>

25:11.510 --> 25:15.012
<i>of a very keen and exacting
historical record.</i>

25:15.096 --> 25:18.840
<i>We know the Spanish Treasure
Fleet went down in that area.</i>

25:18.925 --> 25:21.260
<i>We know for a fact--
There's ship's logs</i>

25:21.344 --> 25:24.346
<i>that catalogue what was
on these ships, treasure-wise.</i>

25:24.439 --> 25:26.181
So they've got
a lot of advantage

25:26.274 --> 25:27.942
that you guys don't have
on Oak Island.

25:28.101 --> 25:31.436
<i>The goal tomorrow is, get in
the water a little earlier,</i>

25:31.521 --> 25:34.022
and hit the rest of the targets
that we haven't got to yet.

25:34.115 --> 25:36.275
You know,
follow that debris field.

25:36.368 --> 25:38.619
<i>And I don't know if you remember
when John showed us</i>

25:38.778 --> 25:40.195
<i>that big bar of silver...</i>

25:40.280 --> 25:42.206
Damn straight, I remember
the big bar of silver.

25:42.290 --> 25:44.124
My back still hurts.

25:44.209 --> 25:45.867
Well, I'm hoping after tomorrow
I'll be able to show you

25:45.952 --> 25:47.202
something real similar.

25:47.295 --> 25:49.129
I certainly hope so,
Matty Blake.

25:49.289 --> 25:50.297
Get back after it.

25:50.382 --> 25:51.873
Thanks, fellas.

25:51.958 --> 25:53.208
- Talk to you soon.
- MARTY: Best of luck.

25:53.293 --> 25:54.468
- See ya. Stay safe.
- Good luck, Matty.

25:54.553 --> 25:55.627
Good luck, mate.

25:55.712 --> 25:56.971
MATTY:
Cheers, guys.

26:03.136 --> 26:05.980
NARRATOR: As a new day begins
in Sebastian, Florida...

26:06.139 --> 26:07.806
- MATTY: Good morning, team.
- GREG: Hey, good morning, Matty.

26:07.890 --> 26:08.974
- How you doing this morning?
- How you guys doing?

26:09.058 --> 26:10.976
Matty Blake once again joins

26:11.060 --> 26:13.395
treasure salvager John Brandon
and his team.

26:13.479 --> 26:14.905
So, what's the plan for today?
What you got?

26:15.064 --> 26:16.148
GREG:
So, where we were yesterday,

26:16.241 --> 26:17.733
we had a lot of targets.

26:17.817 --> 26:19.243
And so, I want to
keep following this trail

26:19.402 --> 26:20.736
- and see what else is on it.
- JOHN B.: Very good.

26:20.820 --> 26:23.372
Let's go get it.
Let's go get it. All right.

26:24.916 --> 26:26.908
NARRATOR:
They are continuing their search

26:26.993 --> 26:29.003
in a previously unexplored area

26:29.162 --> 26:31.255
for wreckage connected to

26:31.339 --> 26:34.666
the famed
1715 Spanish Treasure Fleet,

26:34.759 --> 26:39.171
which may be hiding millions
in lost gold and silver.

26:39.255 --> 26:40.756
MATTY: Day two, you
know, they're ready to go.

26:40.849 --> 26:42.591
I'm definitely ready to go.

26:42.684 --> 26:44.518
I think we're all
very encouraged

26:44.603 --> 26:47.271
by what was found yesterday
in just a short dive.

26:47.355 --> 26:48.930
GREG:
It looks like we're pretty good.

26:49.015 --> 26:50.357
JOHN B.:
It looks real good. Right on it.

26:50.442 --> 26:52.276
Today's the day.

26:52.360 --> 26:53.777
GREG:
All right, let's dig a hole.

26:53.862 --> 26:55.771
(chain links clicking)

26:55.864 --> 26:58.198
NARRATOR:
Having reached their target area

26:58.283 --> 27:00.951
and anchored the salvage boat...

27:01.036 --> 27:04.538
- Going in gear.
- Captain Greg Bounds once again employs

27:04.623 --> 27:08.700
the high-powered mailbox blowers
to clear the silt and sand

27:08.785 --> 27:10.619
from the ocean bottom below,

27:10.712 --> 27:13.455
so the divers can begin
their search.

27:13.548 --> 27:15.957
GREG: All right, Matty, we're
over, uh, "big boy" target here.

27:16.042 --> 27:17.635
There's a little bit
more mass to it

27:17.719 --> 27:19.053
- than what we got yesterday.
- All right, we like that.

27:19.137 --> 27:21.555
So, we should uncover it
on our first hole.

27:21.640 --> 27:23.131
All right, let's get 'em
in the water.

27:23.216 --> 27:24.800
- What do you think, Captain?
- All right, let's do it.

27:24.893 --> 27:26.310
JOHN B.:
Find something.

♪ ♪

27:44.829 --> 27:46.830
(detector beeping)

27:56.249 --> 27:57.257
All right, so we're
getting targets.

27:57.342 --> 27:59.134
That's great.

28:16.102 --> 28:17.194
All right great,
see you on the surface.

28:17.278 --> 28:18.696
Great, great, over.

GREG: Looks like some
rigging pieces of some sort.

28:28.123 --> 28:29.531
Could this be a blunderbuss?

28:29.615 --> 28:31.032
-(laughter) -JOHN B.:
No, they all-- looks like...

28:31.117 --> 28:32.710
It's kind of in the shape
of a blunderbuss.

28:32.869 --> 28:33.877
They all look
like ship's spikes.

28:33.962 --> 28:36.380
(overlapping chatter)

28:36.464 --> 28:38.132
This is probably
the head of the spike,

28:38.291 --> 28:39.708
the tail, all of these.

28:39.801 --> 28:40.959
But they all look
like they could

28:41.043 --> 28:42.553
very well be period material

28:42.637 --> 28:44.796

38:02.446 --> 38:03.521
<i>I don't know
if you guys can tell,</i>

38:03.605 --> 38:06.941
Uh, it appears to depict
the Madonna.

38:07.026 --> 38:08.785
- MATT: Wow.
- MARTY: Yeah. - Yeah.

38:08.869 --> 38:10.370
<i>JOHN B.:
It's a magnificent piece</i>

38:10.454 --> 38:12.697
because they didn't have
gold-plating back in 1715,

38:12.781 --> 38:15.283
They would actually dip items
in molten gold

38:15.376 --> 38:17.702
<i>to put a gold sheen on them.</i>

38:17.786 --> 38:19.045
And that's
what's been done to this.

38:19.130 --> 38:20.714
A very, very impressive piece.

38:20.798 --> 38:22.540
- (Matty groaning)
- MARTY: Very cool piece.

38:22.624 --> 38:24.384
- It's unbelievable.
- And it brings it to life, too.

38:24.468 --> 38:26.878
We know they, you know,
they were Catholic

38:26.971 --> 38:28.546
and Christians,

38:28.630 --> 38:29.889
and so you picture
the inside of that ship

38:30.049 --> 38:31.808
with a shiny gold, uh, Madonna.

38:31.892 --> 38:33.643
It's just stunning.

38:33.802 --> 38:35.303
Where did you say
that treasure site was?

38:35.387 --> 38:37.397
(laughter)

38:37.481 --> 38:39.566
Mike, right now, is
in a virgin area, uh,

38:39.725 --> 38:40.734
where he's working.

38:40.818 --> 38:41.809
No one's ever

38:41.902 --> 38:43.728
<i>found treasure there before.</i>

38:43.812 --> 38:45.572
<i>He's putting the clues together.</i>

38:45.656 --> 38:48.649
<i>He's got just tremendous areas
to work out there</i>

38:48.743 --> 38:50.160
that look to be very,
very promising.

38:50.244 --> 38:52.162
Bravo, bravo, Mike.

38:52.246 --> 38:53.654
- Great finds, beautiful stuff.
- Yeah, congratulations.

38:53.748 --> 38:56.666
<i>It's probably the best find</i>

38:56.825 --> 38:59.077
<i>of worked silver artifacts
ever made</i>

38:59.161 --> 39:00.754
<i>in the history of the 1715 Fleet</i>

39:00.838 --> 39:03.590
<i>in modern times
by modern salvers.</i>

39:03.674 --> 39:04.924
But there's no telling
what else he'll find

39:05.009 --> 39:06.584
along that trail.

39:06.668 --> 39:09.012
He's-he's found
beautiful escudo gold coins.

39:09.096 --> 39:10.254
- I think Mike even brought a...
- Yeah.

39:10.348 --> 39:11.348
We've got a couple more.

39:11.432 --> 39:12.849
Top-pocket find.

39:13.008 --> 39:14.184
- Top pocket!
- Yeah, top-pocket find.

39:14.268 --> 39:15.426
MARTY:
Top-pocket find.

39:15.511 --> 39:16.427
<i>Show you one of the gold coins</i>

39:16.512 --> 39:17.520
that we wound up finding.

39:17.605 --> 39:18.688
So, it's very similar to

39:18.847 --> 39:20.023
what John's wearing
around his neck.

39:20.107 --> 39:21.024
Look at that.

39:22.601 --> 39:24.611
So, this is an eight escudo.

39:24.695 --> 39:26.780
And this particular coin was
minted in Mexico City

39:26.864 --> 39:29.199
in 1714,

39:29.283 --> 39:30.775
<i>- and it's a unique dye.
- JOHN B.: In the entire time</i>

39:30.859 --> 39:33.953
<i>that I've been doing this,
over 55 years,</i>

39:34.038 --> 39:36.373
I've probably found
seven or eight

39:36.457 --> 39:38.616
of these dye nines
or "gras" coins.

39:38.709 --> 39:42.036
<i>Mike found seven or eight
in one or two days.</i>

39:42.121 --> 39:45.548
<i>So, um, it was
a very, very significant find</i>

39:45.633 --> 39:48.551
numismatically off of
the, uh, 1715 Fleet shipwrecks.

39:48.636 --> 39:50.220
- Beautiful.
- Yeah.

39:50.304 --> 39:52.389
<i>Mike's got another piece here
he can show you.</i>

39:52.473 --> 39:55.058
<i>So, this is probably my favorite
artifact that we found.</i>

39:55.217 --> 39:58.353
And, uh, this is
a solid silver lion.

39:59.555 --> 40:01.564
Wow.

40:01.723 --> 40:04.809
- That is cool.
- Truly, truly remarkable.

40:04.902 --> 40:07.487
He's sitting on his haunches,
but you can see

40:07.571 --> 40:10.573
the mane of the lion
flowing down his back,

40:10.658 --> 40:13.993
and, uh, he's got
a-a shield of some sort.

40:14.078 --> 40:16.162
Beautiful. Well done.

40:16.247 --> 40:18.748
One thing we all know is
the treasure's been out there

40:18.833 --> 40:19.999
for over 300 years.

40:20.159 --> 40:21.659
<i>It's not going anywhere</i>

40:21.743 --> 40:24.254
<i>until Mike or one of our crew
brings it up.</i>

40:24.413 --> 40:26.840
Well, congratulations,
Mike and John.

40:26.924 --> 40:30.260
I thank you again for the honor
of letting me watch you work.

40:30.344 --> 40:32.503
Uh, please express
to Captain Greg

40:32.588 --> 40:33.763
that I think he's a rock star,

40:33.848 --> 40:35.348
He's got a great crew,

40:35.433 --> 40:37.267
and I just loved
every second of it.

40:37.351 --> 40:40.011
Hey, understood, Matty.
We'll relay the message.

40:40.104 --> 40:42.847
It was great talking with
all of you guys today.

40:42.931 --> 40:44.774
<i>And, uh, all we can say is</i>

40:44.933 --> 40:46.601
<i>much success up there
at Oak Island.</i>

40:46.694 --> 40:47.861
You've got us all juiced up

40:47.945 --> 40:49.362
because there's nothing
like seeing...

40:49.521 --> 40:51.865
I mean, Gary's-Gary's dying
to get back out there now.

40:51.949 --> 40:53.941
Nothing like seeing
real treasure.

40:54.034 --> 40:56.035
All right, guys.
You have a great day.

40:56.120 --> 40:57.454
- Thank you.
- Same. See you chaps.

40:57.538 --> 40:58.955
Congratulations.

40:59.114 --> 41:01.875
Well, I should've taken
another boat ride.

41:01.959 --> 41:04.377
- (other chuckle)
- Yes, it was exciting

41:04.462 --> 41:06.370
to pull those large artifacts.

41:06.455 --> 41:08.789
It was thrilling, actually, to
pull those large artifacts

41:08.874 --> 41:10.300
on that boat, but that's,
like, what I had in mind.

41:10.384 --> 41:11.626
Some sort of silver
or gold plate

41:11.710 --> 41:13.127
or something like that.

41:13.212 --> 41:15.129
Sounds like I missed it
by 48 hours.

41:15.222 --> 41:16.973
- I mean... that much.
- (sighs)

41:17.132 --> 41:18.382
RICK: Yeah,
but you didn't miss it,

41:18.476 --> 41:20.143
because you still have
the experience, right?

41:20.227 --> 41:22.479
You still have the memories,
right?

41:22.638 --> 41:24.889
- It'll never leave you.
- MATTY: No way.

41:24.982 --> 41:27.317
And-and, you know, we always say
all the time here

41:27.401 --> 41:29.486
that, like, when we go
on these adventures, right,

41:29.645 --> 41:30.820
we're only there
for a couple days.

41:30.905 --> 41:32.396
It takes longer than that.

41:32.490 --> 41:34.482
And this is probably
the ultimate example of that,

41:34.566 --> 41:36.400
just two or three more days,

41:36.485 --> 41:37.911
I would've been part of
something like that.

41:37.995 --> 41:39.320
So, it's like, you can't just...

41:39.404 --> 41:41.072
How long have they been
salvaging the 1715 Fleet?

41:41.165 --> 41:42.240
How many years?

41:42.324 --> 41:43.908
John, over 50 years.

41:43.992 --> 41:46.336
Yeah, this is not done
overnight.

41:46.420 --> 41:48.746
- You know what that says?
- I know what that says.

41:48.830 --> 41:51.257
We could put a lot of years
out back yet.

41:51.342 --> 41:52.759
All right, guys.

41:52.843 --> 41:55.094
Well, like-like I say,
we're all juiced up.

41:55.254 --> 41:56.346
- Let's go get our own.
- MATTY: All right. - GARY: Yeah.

41:58.423 --> 42:00.016
MATTY:
Ah, what an adventure.

42:00.100 --> 42:01.684
- MARTY: Absolutely.
- GARY: Cor blimey.
