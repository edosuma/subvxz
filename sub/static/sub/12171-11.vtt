07:01.542 --> 07:02.582
This was not anyone,

07:02.583 --> 07:04.083
- anything, anything.
- Oh.

He was like, "you are vida"

through and through."

07:07.250 --> 07:09.250
He's not wrong about that.

07:09.292 --> 07:10.667
I think that there's

07:10.668 --> 07:12.042
this probable thing

07:12.083 --> 07:13.917
that I'm supposed to live alone.

07:13.958 --> 07:15.226
- Maybe I'm too much
- to deal with,

07:15.250 --> 07:16.521
You know,

07:16.522 --> 07:17.791
maybe I'm just not worth it,

07:17.792 --> 07:19.624
you know?

07:19.625 --> 07:20.792
With men, okay,

07:20.793 --> 07:21.957
you have to be careful

07:21.958 --> 07:23.708
- that all this stuff
- doesn't turn into,

07:23.750 --> 07:24.896
"Why this, why this? Ahh."

07:24.897 --> 07:26.042
That's what it was.

07:26.083 --> 07:27.958
- And then that's
- when it's like, downhill.

07:28.000 --> 07:29.750
- That's where we were.
- You can't get...

07:29.792 --> 07:31.375
- But I did.
- I mean, I'm...

07:31.417 --> 07:33.624
I'm confessing I did.

07:35.585 --> 07:37.542
so many others out there

Hey, monk.

08:01.625 --> 08:02.750
Good morning.

08:04.667 --> 08:06.063
Excuse me, can we order

08:06.064 --> 08:07.458
some eggs for everyone?

08:07.500 --> 08:08.709
I'll have an egg white

08:08.710 --> 08:09.917
omelette with vegetables.

08:16.375 --> 08:17.917

- Salam.

No, this is my vibrator.

08:19.667 --> 08:21.083

- Can I see it?
- [Inaudible]

08:27.583 --> 08:29.207
Mj and I...

08:29.208 --> 08:31.143
- We got one yesterday.
- So, some of us can come out

08:31.167 --> 08:32.333
And go cave tubing

08:32.375 --> 08:33.874
or stay here at the hotel

08:33.875 --> 08:34.958
and go and have a massage.

08:35.000 --> 08:36.292
I'm thinking to myself,

08:36.333 --> 08:38.208
- if Jessica
- would've come to Belize,

08:38.211 --> 08:40.042
- We'd be experiencing
- all this together.

08:40.045 --> 08:41.375
Departure, 12 noon.

08:42.875 --> 08:44.167
She loves this kind of stuff.

08:44.208 --> 08:46.167

- she loves drinking,

08:46.208 --> 08:47.458
She loves eating ceviche.

08:47.500 --> 08:48.875
Then we go hiking up

08:48.917 --> 08:50.541
and then you have an inner tube

08:50.542 --> 08:52.167
and you just float down a river.

08:52.208 --> 08:54.167
- I have this fantasy
- in my mind,

08:54.208 --> 08:55.438
She's gonna surprise me

08:55.439 --> 08:56.667
and come to Belize.

08:57.875 --> 08:59.625
- I'm hopeful.
- You go through the rivers

08:59.667 --> 09:01.021
And then you see the stalactites

09:01.022 --> 09:02.375
and stalagmites.

09:02.417 --> 09:03.518
Is it dark in there or what?

09:03.542 --> 09:05.541
Yeah, so you have a light.

09:05.542 --> 09:06.667
Uh, on your head, okay.

09:06.708 --> 09:07.809
- Yeah, you have
- a light on your head

09:07.833 --> 09:09.417
- And then you just go through
- the river and...

09:09.420 --> 09:10.917
- I was kind of freaking out
- about that last night.

09:10.920 --> 09:12.582
I don't like caves.

- Oh my gosh.
- Aww.

That's awesome.

11:00.667 --> 11:02.499
I can't believe it.

11:02.500 --> 11:04.458

- And I definitely,

11:22.376 --> 11:23.542
were meant to end

11:23.583 --> 11:25.396
but this is

11:25.397 --> 11:27.207
a beautiful exception to that.

- I love you
- more than the mets, baby.

- Mm-hmm.

- if the hospital

11:48.545 --> 11:50.208

- is that good,

- make claims,

I didn't even have

14:04.189 --> 14:05.333
the number saved,

14:05.375 --> 14:07.792
and she blew the f... up.

14:07.833 --> 14:09.351
- And I tried to explain it to her
- and she didn't wanna hear it

14:09.375 --> 14:11.333
- And that's it.
- That's what made her leave?

14:11.375 --> 14:13.542
Yeah, yeah.

At this point,

- Is gonna happen.

- married to her,

14:21.083 --> 14:23.125
Have you ever done her wrong?

14:23.167 --> 14:24.688
Have I ever done anything...

14:24.689 --> 14:26.208
No, no, no,

14:26.250 --> 14:28.167
- get very specific.
- Have I cheated on her?

14:28.208 --> 14:29.354
Yeah.

14:29.355 --> 14:30.500
No, no.

14:30.542 --> 14:32.375
- Does she believe you
- and know that?

14:32.417 --> 14:33.726
- I don't know
- what she believes.

14:33.750 --> 14:34.893
- At this point,
- I don't know what she believes.

14:34.917 --> 14:36.226
- Because believing
- is an important thing.

14:36.250 --> 14:38.208
- I see.
- Girls throw themselves at me.

14:38.211 --> 14:39.542
Jessica's telling everyone

14:39.583 --> 14:40.708
who will listen

14:40.750 --> 14:41.750
that you've been

14:41.751 --> 14:42.751
unfaithful to her,

14:42.792 --> 14:44.667
a lot.

14:44.708 --> 14:46.667
These are all allegations.

14:49.417 --> 14:50.605
The entire f... ing world

14:50.606 --> 14:51.792
knows I'm married.

14:53.458 --> 14:55.917
I didn't keep it a secret.

14:55.958 --> 14:57.583
- You're out with sherv.
- Uh-huh.

14:57.584 --> 14:58.601
And you're pouring drinks

14:58.625 --> 15:00.250
- like you're entertaining
- these women.

15:00.292 --> 15:01.393
- So f... ing what?
- We're at a club.

15:01.417 --> 15:02.518
- Mike.
- I'm having a good time.

15:02.542 --> 15:03.583
- Mike, Mike.
- I'm having a good time.

15:03.586 --> 15:04.768
- Reza,
- what is he supposed to do?

15:04.792 --> 15:05.917
- Come on, sherv.
- What am I supposed to do,

15:05.920 --> 15:07.084
I'm not dead.

15:07.085 --> 15:08.250
Sherv, sherv. Oh f...

15:08.292 --> 15:10.167
I don't have a guilty mind.

15:10.208 --> 15:11.583
So things that I do,

15:11.625 --> 15:13.768
- I don't see as being wrong.
- It's not about a guilty mind.

15:13.792 --> 15:14.875
You also have

15:14.917 --> 15:18.416
very disgusting, flirty...

15:18.417 --> 15:19.726
- At some point,
- you're gonna have to face it.

15:19.750 --> 15:20.917
- No, I don't have
- to face nothing,

15:20.920 --> 15:22.083
- To be honest with you.
- Okay. [Inaudible]

15:22.086 --> 15:23.268
- So, if you wanna talk
- about it,

15:23.292 --> 15:24.625
I'll just walk out of the pool.

15:24.667 --> 15:27.708
[Music playing]

15:31.125 --> 15:32.291
Mike, please don't walk out.

15:32.292 --> 15:34.125
- Jessica's not gonna
- f... ing leave him

15:34.128 --> 15:35.457
On some bullsh...

15:35.458 --> 15:36.854
I thought it was gonna be cool

15:36.855 --> 15:38.250
with Mike, saying,

15:38.292 --> 15:39.917
"oh yeah, Jessica left me"

15:39.958 --> 15:40.958
because I wasn't giving

15:40.959 --> 15:41.959
her attention.

15:42.000 --> 15:43.083
Jessica left me

15:43.125 --> 15:45.417
"because I was working too much."

15:45.458 --> 15:47.124
F... that.

15:47.125 --> 15:48.771
"I left him

15:48.772 --> 15:50.417
because he cheated on me."

15:50.458 --> 15:52.291
These stories don't add up.

15:52.292 --> 15:53.792
Mike and Jessica

15:53.833 --> 15:55.417
are telling me things

15:55.458 --> 15:57.958
that make no sense,

15:58.000 --> 15:59.104
and we need to get

15:59.105 --> 16:00.208
to the bottom of this.

16:00.250 --> 16:01.750
Lives are at stake,

16:01.792 --> 16:03.791
marriage, future,

16:03.792 --> 16:05.791
babies, family,

16:05.792 --> 16:08.083
like, this is some big sh...

16:08.125 --> 16:09.643
- What am I gonna say,
- "no, bitch, you're lying."

16:09.667 --> 16:10.684
No, well, define cheating.

16:10.708 --> 16:12.143
- Like, what,
- somebody sent him a text?

16:12.167 --> 16:13.417
- Or him like...
- No, dude.

16:13.458 --> 16:14.792
They just got married.

16:14.833 --> 16:16.083
Sherv, you think his wife

16:16.084 --> 16:17.332
is gonna leave him over a text?

16:17.333 --> 16:19.268
- That's what I'm telling you,
- I've never seen him go that far.

16:19.292 --> 16:20.351
- Huh?
- I've never even seen him

16:20.375 --> 16:21.999
Attempt to go that far.

16:22.000 --> 16:23.166
Okay.

16:23.167 --> 16:24.333
- I'm telling you
- from my experience,

16:24.336 --> 16:25.434
- From what I've seen.
- I know. I've known him

16:25.458 --> 16:26.499
For a lot of years.

16:26.500 --> 16:27.875
I know that he has had

16:27.876 --> 16:29.250
that in him.

16:29.292 --> 16:30.917
I'm worried that I have a friend

16:30.958 --> 16:33.292
that could be in denial.

16:48.375 --> 16:49.792
What's up, buddy?

16:49.833 --> 16:51.000
I'm debating if I stay here

16:51.001 --> 16:52.167
and massage...

16:52.208 --> 16:54.333
- You don't want that, bro.
- Let's go wet the tubes.

- Go f... ing tube with...
- Let's go.

16:56.333 --> 16:57.809
- You're gonna see something
- in your life.

16:57.833 --> 16:59.041
Life's about experience.

16:59.042 --> 17:00.292
The last thing I wanna do

17:00.333 --> 17:01.541
is stick around with Reza

17:01.542 --> 17:03.042
and his harem

17:03.043 --> 17:04.541
of f... ing instigators

17:04.542 --> 17:06.500

- F... it,
- I'll come with you guys.

17:12.875 --> 17:14.559
- Maybe it'll be a good idea
- to go cave tubing

17:14.583 --> 17:15.707
And explore

17:15.708 --> 17:18.292
and get my mind off things.

17:18.333 --> 17:20.042
- Oh, only an hour

17:31.625 --> 17:33.250
- I'm done.
- I'm going home.

right f... ing now.

17:46.917 --> 17:48.875
- Babe, I need your help
- with something.

17:48.917 --> 17:50.084
What?

17:50.085 --> 17:51.249
We both know mj and Tommy

17:51.250 --> 17:52.459
right now are having sex.

17:52.460 --> 17:53.667
Yes.

17:53.708 --> 17:55.749
So, what I would love

17:55.750 --> 17:56.813
is to shoot them

17:56.814 --> 17:57.875
in the water, naked.

17:57.917 --> 17:59.500
- I won't show anything.
- Okay.

17:59.542 --> 18:00.688
How do we convince them?

18:00.689 --> 18:01.833
Where are they staying?

18:58.542 --> 19:00.166
goes down like this, bro.

- holding your phones?

19:01.375 --> 19:02.792
- What?
- Why are you holding

19:02.833 --> 19:03.833
- Your phone?

She was making a homemade movie!

19:06.833 --> 19:08.917
- Yeah.
- Merce, let me see that...

Some people just want

19:10.397 --> 19:11.832
some cameras rolling

19:11.833 --> 19:13.499
while you're ass up naked

19:13.500 --> 19:14.625
in a bed with your man.

19:14.667 --> 19:16.143
- Give us a demo.
- You guys, you guys.

- Once I took the pictures

19:27.000 --> 19:28.166
Of my parents,

19:28.167 --> 19:29.958
I felt so inspired.

19:30.000 --> 19:32.083
- It's been 43 years,
- do you guys love each other?

19:32.125 --> 19:33.583

- Alright, hit it.

- Okay, can you quickly say

19:51.711 --> 19:52.874
You're sorry?

19:54.500 --> 19:55.854
when you two were acting

19:55.855 --> 19:57.207
very inappropriately.

19:57.208 --> 19:58.374
I'm sorry.

19:58.375 --> 19:59.896
Do I feel like I've invaded

19:59.897 --> 20:01.417
her privacy?

20:02.500 --> 20:03.688
No, I've known her

20:03.689 --> 20:04.874
for 25 years,

20:04.875 --> 20:06.333
we've shared everything,

20:06.375 --> 20:08.333
including our private parts.

20:09.375 --> 20:10.875
I want you guys to be like,

20:10.917 --> 20:13.041

20:13.042 --> 20:14.207
And I'm gonna give you flowers

20:14.208 --> 20:15.833
to cover your genitals.

20:17.042 --> 20:18.063

20:19.125 --> 20:20.750

- you know.

20:20.753 --> 20:22.208
I have a body like a god.

20:22.250 --> 20:24.083
- Rez, can you help us, please?
- Yeah, I'm gonna art direct.

20:24.086 --> 20:25.563
You're not art directing,

20:25.564 --> 20:27.042
you can assist.

20:27.083 --> 20:28.333
- Thank you.
- Wow.

- Yeah.
- Yala let's go.

In two weeks.

21:11.458 --> 21:13.708
My girl is the only person

21:13.750 --> 21:15.583
that could ever get me to do

21:15.625 --> 21:17.458
what I'm doing right now.

21:17.500 --> 21:19.583
This does not happen in queens.

21:19.625 --> 21:21.125
Look up.

21:21.167 --> 21:22.563
Now can I get a kiss?

21:22.564 --> 21:23.958
I wanna get a close-up.

21:24.000 --> 21:25.209
Tommy joon,

21:25.210 --> 21:26.417
what made you come here?

21:26.458 --> 21:27.771
She's the best.

21:27.772 --> 21:29.083
Alright.

21:29.125 --> 21:30.542
- You wanna give me
- one last shot?

21:30.583 --> 21:31.771
Ugh.

21:31.772 --> 21:32.957
Tommy and mj couldn't be

21:32.958 --> 21:34.750
more perfect subjects,

21:34.792 --> 21:36.542
however, one thing is for sure,

21:36.583 --> 21:37.792
I'm never stepping

21:37.793 --> 21:38.999
into this pool again, ever.

21:39.000 --> 21:40.332
We got this.

21:40.333 --> 21:41.666
Who knows what's floating around

21:41.667 --> 21:42.999
in that water at this point?

21:43.000 --> 21:44.167
Get out.

21:44.168 --> 21:45.332
So f... ing gorgeous.

21:45.333 --> 21:47.333
- I cannot wait for you guys
- to see this.

21:47.336 --> 21:50.333
[Music playing]

21:53.042 --> 21:55.417
Oh, hey, little fish.

21:55.458 --> 21:57.417
- I see a lot over here,
- like hundreds of them.

21:57.458 --> 21:58.833
Just be careful of the...

21:58.875 --> 22:00.792
- We have piranhas.
- There's a piranha area

22:00.833 --> 22:02.351
- Over there where you are.
- What the f...?

22:02.375 --> 22:03.417
Yeah.

22:03.418 --> 22:04.458
Just kidding.

22:06.625 --> 22:08.018
- This guy's been dying
- to take his shirt off.

22:08.042 --> 22:09.313
Yeah.

22:09.314 --> 22:10.583
Shervin's been dying

22:10.625 --> 22:11.832
to flex in front of Mike.

22:11.833 --> 22:12.917
Just wait until you see

22:12.918 --> 22:13.999
my one.

22:14.000 --> 22:15.750
- Oh yeah?
- Girls don't flex,

22:15.792 --> 22:17.292
We just kind of like,

22:17.293 --> 22:18.792
you know...

22:22.542 --> 22:24.375
That's flexing.

22:24.376 --> 22:26.207
That's a female flex.

22:26.208 --> 22:27.792
- Hi.
- [High pitched]

22:29.208 --> 22:30.458
It looks like a rope,

22:30.459 --> 22:31.707
this is amazing.

22:31.708 --> 22:33.707
They call it the Tarzan vine.

22:33.708 --> 22:35.042
That's cool.

22:35.043 --> 22:36.374
So cool.

22:36.375 --> 22:37.541
I'm a nature girl.

22:37.542 --> 22:39.374
I'm all about the outdoors.

22:39.375 --> 22:41.167
- Frog.
- Let me take a... ew.

22:41.208 --> 22:42.375
- Why, why?
- He's peeing on you.

22:42.378 --> 22:43.875
- That wasn't peeing,
- it's probably poison.

22:43.878 --> 22:45.208
- It's poison.
- Don't touch your face

22:45.211 --> 22:46.292
- Or anything.
- What is up

22:46.333 --> 22:47.708
- With your irrational fear
- of frogs?

22:47.711 --> 22:49.333
- First off,
- the word irrational

22:49.375 --> 22:52.041
Is being used very incorrectly.

22:52.042 --> 22:53.542
I'm very rational about things

22:53.583 --> 22:55.458
that I prefer not to be around.

22:55.500 --> 22:56.707
And afraid?

22:56.708 --> 22:58.374
Alpha sherv doesn't get scared.

22:58.375 --> 23:00.041
Watch your steps

23:00.042 --> 23:01.143
because it's a bit slippery.

23:01.167 --> 23:02.500
Shervin, close your eyes.

23:02.542 --> 23:03.851
- Are there bats?
- So right here, we have

23:03.875 --> 23:05.333
- Pillars.
- Yeah, we have guano bats

23:05.375 --> 23:06.417
- Right here.
- Where are the bats?

23:06.420 --> 23:07.917
- Bats.
- Turn the light,

23:07.918 --> 23:08.918
Get it away from there.

23:08.958 --> 23:10.917
[Speaking farsi] Bats suck.

23:10.958 --> 23:12.958
- I'm not scared of them,
- I just don't like them.

23:14.042 --> 23:15.105
Oh sh...

23:15.106 --> 23:16.167
Oh sh...

23:16.208 --> 23:17.250
- Oh sh...
- Alright,

23:17.292 --> 23:18.375
I don't like bats, bro.

23:18.417 --> 23:19.667
Shervin is afraid

23:19.708 --> 23:21.146
of all small creatures.

23:21.147 --> 23:22.582
[Laughs]

23:22.583 --> 23:24.167
The guy's freaking out

23:24.208 --> 23:25.833
over amphibians,

23:25.875 --> 23:26.916
arachnoids,

23:26.917 --> 23:28.416
and flying rodents.

23:28.417 --> 23:29.500
Oh my god.

23:29.501 --> 23:30.583
Ooh, that's huge.

23:30.625 --> 23:32.000
Okay, let's go out, guys.

23:32.042 --> 23:33.750
- Sherv, there's a bat
- behind you, buddy.

23:33.753 --> 23:35.249
Hey sherv, what about that frog?

23:35.250 --> 23:37.083
- Mike, guide the way.
- I'm having a big problem

23:37.086 --> 23:39.417
With this "fear" word, okay.

23:39.458 --> 23:41.000
I prefer not to hang out

23:41.001 --> 23:42.542
with them.

23:48.750 --> 23:50.250
It says pool this way,

23:50.292 --> 23:51.417
spa that way.

23:51.458 --> 23:52.791
This is the moment

23:52.792 --> 23:54.271
I've been waiting for

23:54.272 --> 23:55.750
since we got here, the massage.

23:55.792 --> 23:56.792
True dat.

23:56.793 --> 23:58.291
Did you facetime Adam?

23:58.292 --> 23:59.292
No, I've been texting

23:59.293 --> 24:00.293
the whole time.

24:00.333 --> 24:01.458
Oh, is he good?

24:01.500 --> 24:02.917
Yeah, he's really good.

24:02.958 --> 24:04.958
- I know.
- He loves his new job so far.

24:04.961 --> 24:06.354
It would've been amazing

24:06.355 --> 24:07.750
to have Adam on this trip.

24:07.792 --> 24:09.750
There's really nothing to do

24:09.792 --> 24:10.917
but eat,

24:10.958 --> 24:12.042
enjoy the scenery

24:12.083 --> 24:13.625
and make sweet, sweet love.

24:13.667 --> 24:15.063
And since I'm sharing a room

24:15.064 --> 24:16.457
with Mike,

24:16.458 --> 24:18.125
I guess I will eat

24:18.167 --> 24:20.125
and enjoy the scenery.

24:20.167 --> 24:21.250
Hello.

24:22.292 --> 24:24.208
Face down, boo boo.

24:24.250 --> 24:26.167
Ooh ooh, oh my god,

24:26.208 --> 24:27.354
it really hurts

24:27.355 --> 24:28.499
on the butt, ouch.

24:28.500 --> 24:29.583
Thank you.

24:29.625 --> 24:30.625
My dear, dear, dear,

24:30.626 --> 24:31.626
best friend.

24:31.667 --> 24:33.292
Do you know ceviche's life?

24:33.333 --> 24:34.750
Yeah.

24:34.792 --> 24:36.292
- Mm.
- Mm.

24:36.333 --> 24:38.833
Asa is obsessed with ceviche

24:38.875 --> 24:40.833
but I don't like ceviche.

24:40.875 --> 24:42.292
I don't like raw fish,

24:42.333 --> 24:43.333
I don't like Sushi,

24:43.375 --> 24:44.833
I don't like ceviche.

24:44.875 --> 24:46.188
They remind me of something else

24:46.189 --> 24:47.499
that I don't like.

24:47.500 --> 24:49.667
I'm gay, remember?

24:52.708 --> 24:54.417
- So babe?
- Yeah?

24:54.458 --> 24:56.499
I feel like what you told me

24:56.500 --> 24:59.458
what Jessica said is one thing,

24:59.500 --> 25:00.917
and the way Mike is acting

25:00.958 --> 25:02.750
is the opposite.

25:02.792 --> 25:03.833
Complete.

25:03.875 --> 25:06.000
I just feel like,

25:06.042 --> 25:08.000
as people who love him...

25:08.042 --> 25:09.707
I need to have a talk?

25:09.708 --> 25:11.042
- Yeah.
- If it can help him,

25:11.083 --> 25:12.541
I'm willing to do it.

25:12.542 --> 25:13.874
He may get mad at me.

25:13.875 --> 25:15.893
- No, he will for sure get mad,
- but you've got to...

25:15.917 --> 25:17.207
Because this is the last talk.

25:17.208 --> 25:18.559
- We can't talk,
- we can't keep having...

25:18.583 --> 25:19.708
No, we can't keep...

25:19.750 --> 25:21.229
It's like beating

25:21.230 --> 25:22.708
a f... ing horse.

25:22.750 --> 25:25.000
I want Mike to fess up

25:25.042 --> 25:26.500
to whatever it is

25:26.501 --> 25:27.958
that Jessica has found out

25:28.000 --> 25:29.792
and Mike isn't prepared to

25:29.833 --> 25:31.292
or won't,

25:31.333 --> 25:33.792
and I need to find out why.

25:33.833 --> 25:35.250
If he decides that he wants

25:35.251 --> 25:36.667
to stay in that mode,

25:36.708 --> 25:37.875
then he stays in that mode.

25:37.917 --> 25:39.583
- Right.
- But at least I tried.

25:41.375 --> 25:42.708
- Coming up...
- I mean,

25:42.750 --> 25:44.625
He can't even admit it.

25:44.667 --> 25:46.333
Like, I wanna have a talk

25:46.375 --> 25:48.041
and knock some f... ing sense

25:48.042 --> 25:49.167
into his head

25:49.208 --> 25:50.229
because I'm worried

25:50.230 --> 25:51.250
he's f... ing up

25:51.292 --> 25:52.500
and he's gonna lose you.

26:03.583 --> 26:05.416
Welcome to xibalba, guys.

26:05.417 --> 26:06.542
Woo.

26:06.583 --> 26:08.417
Wow, that's creepy, you guys.

26:09.750 --> 26:10.851
What you are seeing right here

26:10.875 --> 26:12.000
is mostly limestone.

26:12.042 --> 26:13.250
That's cool.

26:14.250 --> 26:16.875
You guys, oh my god.

26:16.917 --> 26:18.916
What are you guys doing?

26:18.917 --> 26:20.083
What are you doing, bro?

26:20.125 --> 26:21.542
Stop it.

26:22.708 --> 26:24.250
- For the first time
- on this trip,

26:24.292 --> 26:25.334
I had a chance

26:25.335 --> 26:26.375
to just kind of unwind,

26:26.417 --> 26:28.417
with no one interrogating me

26:28.458 --> 26:29.833
about my relationship,

26:29.875 --> 26:31.417
- what the f...'s going on
- in my life

26:31.458 --> 26:32.458
And it gave me a chance

26:32.459 --> 26:33.875
to really forget

26:33.917 --> 26:35.125
- about everything
- I'm going through.

26:35.128 --> 26:36.583
This is really cool.

26:36.625 --> 26:37.792
We find basically,

26:37.793 --> 26:38.957
human sacrifice.

26:38.958 --> 26:40.125
And they offer you as food

26:40.126 --> 26:41.291
to the gods.

26:41.292 --> 26:42.791
Wow, this is amazing.

26:42.792 --> 26:44.042
The reason why this trip

26:44.043 --> 26:45.292
was so amazing to me

26:45.333 --> 26:47.375
- is because it gave me a chance
- to reflect.

26:47.417 --> 26:49.292
- I've been through a lot
- of therapy

26:49.295 --> 26:50.709
These last several months

26:50.710 --> 26:52.124
of my life

26:52.125 --> 26:53.750
and this...

26:53.792 --> 26:56.375
Far exceeds therapy, man,

26:56.417 --> 26:58.208
and think to myself

26:59.583 --> 27:01.291
that I can accomplish anything

27:01.292 --> 27:02.792
I put my mind to,

27:02.833 --> 27:04.104
and if I really want

27:04.105 --> 27:05.375
my wife back,

27:05.417 --> 27:07.292
I can do it.

27:07.333 --> 27:08.750
Woo, yeah.

27:08.792 --> 27:10.291
Oh my god.

27:10.292 --> 27:13.667
[Music playing]

27:13.708 --> 27:15.792
- I love these banana trees,
- though.

27:15.833 --> 27:17.500
- Aren't they just
- gorgeous perfection?

27:17.542 --> 27:18.917
Yeah, they look like fans.

27:18.958 --> 27:21.625
Yeah, amazing that nature god

27:21.667 --> 27:23.625
makes such perfect things.

27:23.667 --> 27:25.458
- We came to like,
- hook up Mike and Jessica

27:25.500 --> 27:26.833
And she's not even coming,

27:26.875 --> 27:28.250
that's kind of f... ed up.

27:28.292 --> 27:30.958
Mike and Jessica is a situation

27:31.000 --> 27:32.750
of he said, she said.

27:32.792 --> 27:34.375
So, I need to find out

27:34.376 --> 27:35.958
what happened.

27:37.167 --> 27:38.332
Are you calling Jessica?

27:38.333 --> 27:39.625
Yes.

27:40.625 --> 27:42.042
Hello?

27:42.043 --> 27:43.458
Jessica?

27:43.500 --> 27:45.667
- Hi.
- Hey, it's Reza, how are you?

27:45.708 --> 27:47.332
I'm okay, how are you?

27:47.333 --> 27:48.396
I'm okay.

27:48.397 --> 27:49.458
I'm super bummed

27:49.500 --> 27:50.500
you're not here.

27:50.501 --> 27:52.250
- There was a part of me
- that was hoping

27:52.292 --> 27:54.125
That you were coming

27:55.333 --> 27:57.707
but I had a talk with Mike

27:57.708 --> 27:58.958
and I don't know what to do.

27:59.000 --> 28:00.542
- I don't know how to...
- Well, what did he say?

28:00.545 --> 28:02.041
He says that you saw

28:02.042 --> 28:03.771
some one and a half year old

28:03.772 --> 28:05.500
text message

28:05.542 --> 28:07.207
and you flew off the deep end

28:07.208 --> 28:08.374
and you left.

28:08.375 --> 28:10.874
Well, I was doing my resume

28:10.875 --> 28:13.042
on his computer

28:13.083 --> 28:14.875
and his imessage popped up.

28:14.917 --> 28:16.875
So, I looked at it

28:16.917 --> 28:18.375
and it went back months before,

28:18.376 --> 28:19.833
weeks before,

28:19.875 --> 28:21.374
all the way to the week

28:21.375 --> 28:24.167
after we got engaged.

28:24.208 --> 28:25.792
Um, he'd been going

28:25.833 --> 28:27.833
and seeing this girl.

28:27.875 --> 28:29.167
And it was a trail

28:29.168 --> 28:30.458
of text messages.

28:30.500 --> 28:31.893
- They're like,
- "send me an address."

28:31.917 --> 28:33.355
"This is what I want you

28:33.356 --> 28:34.792
to wear."

28:34.833 --> 28:37.042
"Dress like this."

28:38.583 --> 28:40.542
"Oh, I'm going here,

28:40.543 --> 28:42.500
can you meet me today?"

28:42.542 --> 28:44.021
And there was multiple

28:44.022 --> 28:45.500
text messages

28:45.542 --> 28:47.146
that were not appropriate

28:47.147 --> 28:48.750
for a married man.

28:49.750 --> 28:51.083
I'm devastated.

28:51.125 --> 28:52.417
I'm so sorry,

28:52.418 --> 28:53.708
I can't believe that.

28:53.750 --> 28:54.875
Yeah.

28:57.125 --> 28:58.146
This is so f... ed up.

28:58.147 --> 28:59.167
[Sighs]

29:03.708 --> 29:05.563
I wish that I could get

29:05.564 --> 29:07.417
through to him.

29:07.458 --> 29:09.000
You seem like the type of girl

29:09.042 --> 29:11.500
that just wants him to get real.

29:12.792 --> 29:14.188
Yes.

29:14.189 --> 29:15.582
So, a part of me is worried

29:15.583 --> 29:18.124
that he is trying to save face

29:18.125 --> 29:19.250
because he's thinking,

29:19.292 --> 29:20.957
"well, if she leaves me"

29:20.958 --> 29:22.624
and I need to find another wife,

29:22.625 --> 29:24.457
I can't get real with Jessica.

29:24.458 --> 29:25.604
I can't be honest

29:25.605 --> 29:26.750
with what went down.

29:26.792 --> 29:28.957
"I can't own what happened,"

29:28.958 --> 29:30.250
and it's driving me insane.

29:30.292 --> 29:32.625
I think it is too.

29:32.667 --> 29:34.375
Like, I wanna have a talk

29:34.417 --> 29:35.855
and knock some f... ing sense

29:35.856 --> 29:37.291
into his head

29:37.292 --> 29:38.355
because I'm worried

29:38.356 --> 29:39.417
he's f... ing up

29:39.458 --> 29:41.125
and he's gonna lose you.

29:43.083 --> 29:44.917
- Reza, I already told you
- how I felt

29:44.958 --> 29:46.958
When I went to dinner with you.

29:47.958 --> 29:49.624
This is, just something

29:49.625 --> 29:52.291
that I'm, I'm...

29:52.292 --> 29:53.480
This is for real.

29:53.481 --> 29:54.667
I'm not going back to him.

29:56.792 --> 29:58.625
There's no chance?

30:00.125 --> 30:01.417
No.

30:04.167 --> 30:05.417
[Inaudible] what do I say?

30:05.418 --> 30:06.666
What the f... do I say?

30:06.667 --> 30:08.500
- I mean,
- he can't even admit it.

30:08.503 --> 30:09.729
Why would...

30:09.730 --> 30:10.958
How are we supposed to move on

30:11.000 --> 30:12.434
- if he can't even admit it?
- No problem.

30:12.458 --> 30:13.646
I am going to work

30:13.647 --> 30:14.833
on his dumb ass,

30:14.875 --> 30:16.084
because the one thing

30:16.085 --> 30:17.292
that's crystal clear

30:17.333 --> 30:18.667
is that he loves you.

30:18.708 --> 30:19.792
The other problem

30:19.833 --> 30:21.063
is that he's a dumb

30:21.064 --> 30:22.292
f... ing idiot

30:22.333 --> 30:23.792
and he took you for granted

30:23.833 --> 30:25.518
- and he thought
- that no matter what he did,

30:25.542 --> 30:26.643
- You would stay.
- He's talking to Jessica.

30:26.667 --> 30:27.792
No problem.

30:29.000 --> 30:31.000
- How's the vacation going
- besides all this?

30:31.042 --> 30:32.355
Honestly, the only reason

30:32.356 --> 30:33.666
I came on this vacation

30:33.667 --> 30:35.332
was the slim chance

30:35.333 --> 30:36.832
that you were gonna come here

30:36.833 --> 30:37.917
and have a reconciliation

30:37.918 --> 30:38.999
with Mike.

30:39.000 --> 30:40.792
I think it's definitely best

30:40.833 --> 30:42.541
that I didn't go.

30:42.542 --> 30:44.333
- I mean,
- it wasn't a one-time thing

30:44.375 --> 30:45.874
Like he claims it was.

30:45.875 --> 30:47.374
It was an ongoing thing.

30:47.375 --> 30:48.875
Not only did he cheat,

30:48.917 --> 30:50.875
it was on multiple occasions.

30:50.917 --> 30:52.313
He can't wiggle

30:52.314 --> 30:53.707
his way out of it.

30:53.708 --> 30:55.707
Step up, be a man,

30:55.708 --> 30:57.541
admit your mistake,

30:57.542 --> 30:59.500
grow and learn from it.

30:59.542 --> 31:01.874
Tonight, I am going to force him

31:01.875 --> 31:03.042
to step up and be the man

31:03.043 --> 31:04.207
that you deserve,

31:04.208 --> 31:06.042
whether you leave him or not.

31:06.083 --> 31:07.874
Before you're done, done, done,

31:07.875 --> 31:09.438
I want him to have

31:09.439 --> 31:11.000
that moment of clarity

31:11.042 --> 31:12.209
where he's actually

31:12.210 --> 31:13.375
a real f... ing man

31:13.417 --> 31:15.041
and he admits the truth.

31:15.042 --> 31:16.105
Okay.

31:16.106 --> 31:17.167
Have a great...

31:17.208 --> 31:19.292
- Thank you for everything.
- You got it.

31:19.333 --> 31:20.542
Bye.

31:20.543 --> 31:21.750
Okay, bye.

31:23.958 --> 31:25.250
Coming up...

31:25.292 --> 31:26.582
I talked to Jessica.

31:26.583 --> 31:27.833
Don't call my wife anymore.

31:27.875 --> 31:29.708
But Mike, you lie sometimes.

31:29.750 --> 31:31.042
- Mike.
- No.

31:31.083 --> 31:32.417
- I know you're heated.
- I'm f... ing furious, dude.

31:32.420 --> 31:33.542
Mike, but it's not good

31:33.583 --> 31:34.684
- when you're furious.
- I'm furious.

31:34.708 --> 31:35.771
No one wins

31:35.772 --> 31:36.833
when you're furious.

31:36.875 --> 31:39.959
Mike.

31:39.960 --> 31:43.042
I am packing and I'm leaving.

31:45.750 --> 31:47.249
Ugh, what a drive.

31:47.250 --> 31:48.916
Oh my goodness.

31:48.917 --> 31:50.417
- I wonder what everyone else
- is doing right now.

31:50.420 --> 31:52.184
- What is the over under
- of how many pounds of ceviche

31:52.208 --> 31:53.582
Have been taken down?

31:53.583 --> 31:54.667
Oh man.

31:54.708 --> 31:56.000
I don't know about the amount

31:56.042 --> 31:57.351
- of ceviche they ate,
- but I can tell you

31:57.375 --> 31:58.709
They missed out, big time.

31:58.710 --> 32:00.042
Oh yeah, they did.

32:00.083 --> 32:01.417
- Welcome back.
- Hi.

32:01.420 --> 32:02.833
- How was it?
- Really, really,

32:02.875 --> 32:04.417
- Really, really amazing, yeah.
- Yeah?

32:04.420 --> 32:06.292
- [Speaking farsi]
- Let's take a shower.

32:06.295 --> 32:08.208
- Yeah, you guys need to go
- get ready.

32:08.250 --> 32:09.458
- Are you guys getting ready
- for dinner?

32:09.461 --> 32:11.625
- See you guys soon.
- Bye guys, see you tonight.

32:11.628 --> 32:12.917
I'm gonna go get ready.

32:12.958 --> 32:14.542
Mike, Mike,

32:14.543 --> 32:16.124
can we talk for a sec?

32:16.125 --> 32:17.625
About?

32:17.626 --> 32:19.124
About a phone call.

32:19.125 --> 32:21.292
Mike is a captive right now

32:21.333 --> 32:23.250
and his denials

32:23.292 --> 32:25.624
have not helped his cause.

32:25.625 --> 32:27.958
He's no closer to Jessica

32:28.000 --> 32:29.458
and I'm thinking

32:29.500 --> 32:31.542
maybe if you're honest

32:31.583 --> 32:33.083
about everything,

32:33.125 --> 32:34.791
you guys have a shot.

32:34.792 --> 32:36.042
[Clears throat]

32:36.083 --> 32:37.917
I talked to Jessica

32:40.625 --> 32:41.709
and I wanna talk to you

32:41.710 --> 32:42.792
about it.

32:42.833 --> 32:44.188
What did she say?

32:44.189 --> 32:45.542
She got very specific with me

32:45.583 --> 32:47.167
about what it was

32:47.168 --> 32:48.750
that she found out.

32:49.708 --> 32:50.999
She was on your computer,

32:51.000 --> 32:52.499
she was redoing her resume.

32:52.500 --> 32:54.460
- Yeah, I know the story already
- and I told you,

32:54.500 --> 32:55.625
This was text messages

32:55.626 --> 32:56.750
of just bullsh...

32:56.792 --> 32:58.143
- That was coming through
- my phone.

32:58.167 --> 32:59.833
- She said
- she saw something of you

32:59.836 --> 33:00.979
Telling some bitch

33:00.980 --> 33:02.125
to wear something specific.

33:02.167 --> 33:04.125
No, no, no.

33:04.167 --> 33:05.292
That's not the truth.

33:09.167 --> 33:10.667
- So, she's upset.
- Okay.

33:10.708 --> 33:11.917
So anyways,

33:11.918 --> 33:13.125
tell me what she wants.

33:13.167 --> 33:14.167
She wants you to own up

33:14.168 --> 33:15.167
to the things

33:15.168 --> 33:16.333
that you've done.

33:16.375 --> 33:18.250
- Uh-huh.
- And admit the things

33:18.292 --> 33:19.396
That you've done.

33:19.397 --> 33:20.500
Uh-huh.

33:20.542 --> 33:22.167
And that's the only way

33:22.208 --> 33:23.438
you could have a chance

33:23.439 --> 33:24.667
of getting her back.

33:26.667 --> 33:28.208
There's nothing to admit.

33:31.500 --> 33:33.333
So, that's it.

33:34.375 --> 33:35.874
Don't call my wife anymore

33:35.875 --> 33:37.041
because if you're gonna do that

33:37.042 --> 33:39.042
- and then,
- knowing she's upset with me,

33:39.083 --> 33:40.458
And then do this.

33:40.500 --> 33:41.833
It's not gonna work.

33:41.875 --> 33:43.250
My dad uses this phrase

33:43.251 --> 33:44.625
"schadenfreude,"

33:44.667 --> 33:46.063
which means getting pleasure off

33:46.064 --> 33:47.458
other people's pain.

33:49.708 --> 33:51.042
And these people,

- doing this.

- Continue to do what?

- by any chance?

- Yes.
- Can I please have it?

34:31.042 --> 34:32.184
- Mike.
- To admit to something

- That's not true,
- that's the problem.

- is not true.

With his bag?

36:58.458 --> 36:59.559
- Is his bag there?
- His bag is still...

36:59.583 --> 37:01.333
- Yeah.
- Good.

37:05.083 --> 37:06.583
- What's up, brother?
- Yeah, what's going on?

37:06.586 --> 37:08.167
[Speaking farsi]

37:08.208 --> 37:09.208
Yeah.

37:09.250 --> 37:10.417
- [Speaking farsi]
- Dude,

37:10.458 --> 37:12.083
- What were you guys
- yelling about?

37:13.583 --> 37:14.917
Why, are you nervous?

37:17.250 --> 37:18.601
- What's up, buddy?
- What's going on?

37:18.625 --> 37:20.042
- Come on in. Nothing.
- I'm sorry.

37:20.083 --> 37:21.208
I'm not mad at you.

37:21.250 --> 37:22.268
- There's just ways
- to do things.

37:22.292 --> 37:23.521
And it's just...

37:23.522 --> 37:24.749
What happened?

37:24.750 --> 37:25.916
I just heard yelling, that's it.

37:25.917 --> 37:27.018
Yeah, we could hear yelling.

37:27.042 --> 37:28.101
- We could hear it from here.
- What?

37:28.125 --> 37:29.750
- We could hear you guys yelling
- from here.

37:29.753 --> 37:31.083
- Are you guys ready?
- Yeah.

37:31.086 --> 37:33.083
- Yeah, we're all ready.
- Okay.

37:33.125 --> 37:34.188
Should we go?

37:34.189 --> 37:35.250
Yeah, come to our villa.

37:35.292 --> 37:36.416
Grab your drink.

37:36.417 --> 37:37.958
Oh, sweet. Thank you.

37:44.792 --> 37:46.167
I am f... ing tired

37:46.168 --> 37:47.542
of this sh...

37:47.583 --> 37:49.458
They wanna f... ing bury me.

37:51.000 --> 37:52.479
Did you cheat on Jessica?

37:52.480 --> 37:53.957
Why would I f... ing...

37:53.958 --> 37:55.104
Come on,

37:55.105 --> 37:56.265
I'm not that f... ing stupid.

37:57.792 --> 37:59.958
I'm stupid, but not that stupid.

38:04.958 --> 38:06.292
Hi man.

38:06.293 --> 38:07.624
What was that all about?

38:07.625 --> 38:08.792
I talked to Jessica

38:08.793 --> 38:09.957
and I told Mike

38:09.958 --> 38:11.792
that I'd spoken with Jessica

38:11.833 --> 38:14.042
and he blew up.

38:14.083 --> 38:15.917
- On her or telling you?
- On me.

38:15.958 --> 38:17.250
- On you?
- Hello.

38:17.292 --> 38:18.417
Hello.

38:18.458 --> 38:20.292
- I'm so glad
- that you are all here.

38:20.333 --> 38:21.792
- Where's Mike?
- That's what we...

38:21.833 --> 38:22.833
- That's what
- we were talking about.

38:22.836 --> 38:24.333
- Sit down.
- [Inaudible]

38:24.375 --> 38:25.458
He got a little upset.

38:25.500 --> 38:26.666
Do you wanna...?

38:26.667 --> 38:28.625
- So what happened?
- He just got really upset

38:28.667 --> 38:30.500
- That I had spoken
- with Jessica and he...

38:30.503 --> 38:32.292
- What was
- the conversation about?

38:32.333 --> 38:34.083
- You know, I hit her up
- because I said,

38:34.125 --> 38:35.396
"Hey, Tommy's here.

38:35.397 --> 38:36.666
Are you coming?"

38:36.667 --> 38:38.499
She's like, "no, absolutely not",

38:38.500 --> 38:40.458
- "I'm not coming,"
- and, you know,

38:40.500 --> 38:41.832
She told me some stuff

38:41.833 --> 38:44.166
that was very disturbing and...

38:44.167 --> 38:45.500
- Like what?
- What?

38:45.542 --> 38:47.021
She said that

38:47.022 --> 38:48.499
he had stepped out on her.

38:48.500 --> 38:49.729
She saw some very specific

38:49.730 --> 38:50.958
text messages

38:51.000 --> 38:53.332
and she said, "there's no way."

38:53.333 --> 38:54.499
I'm done with his ass."

38:54.500 --> 38:55.708
He's here.

38:58.375 --> 38:59.476
- What's up, bud?
- What's up?

38:59.500 --> 39:00.583
How are you?

39:00.625 --> 39:01.667
- Do you guys wanna have
- a drink first?

39:01.670 --> 39:03.063
Reza, Reza, Reza.

39:03.064 --> 39:04.458
[Inaudible]

39:04.500 --> 39:05.521
[Speaking farsi]

39:05.522 --> 39:06.542
Got my shirt soaked.

39:06.583 --> 39:09.625
[Music playing]

39:12.875 --> 39:14.167
- Coming up...
- I have someone

39:14.208 --> 39:16.000
- Who I love dearly
- and I made mistakes.

39:16.042 --> 39:18.000
I was a bad husband.

39:18.042 --> 39:19.667
The only thing that I want

39:19.708 --> 39:21.000
is for you and her

39:21.001 --> 39:22.292
to be back together, period.

39:22.333 --> 39:23.375
- Me too.
- That's it.

39:23.378 --> 39:24.542
Me too.

39:28.875 --> 39:30.125
Dude, I'm sweating.

39:30.167 --> 39:31.417
My shirt's soaked, okay.

39:31.418 --> 39:32.667
[Speaking farsi]

39:33.708 --> 39:35.042
I'm sorry.

39:39.708 --> 39:41.042
First off,

39:41.043 --> 39:42.374
I'm not angry with you.

39:42.375 --> 39:44.333
- What you were doing
- was trying to help

39:44.375 --> 39:46.250
And I appreciate that.

39:46.292 --> 39:47.521
And because of what happened

39:47.522 --> 39:48.749
last year,

39:48.750 --> 39:50.000
I'm trying to overcome

39:50.042 --> 39:51.396
these feelings

39:51.397 --> 39:52.750
of anxiety and anger

39:52.792 --> 39:53.875
but it's still hard for me.

39:53.917 --> 39:54.934
And I don't know who I can trust

39:54.958 --> 39:56.500
- and who I can't trust.
- Right.

39:56.542 --> 39:58.917
- Right?
- I have someone who I love dearly

40:00.417 --> 40:01.417
And I made mistakes.

40:01.418 --> 40:03.500
I was a bad husband.

40:05.917 --> 40:07.000
And these text messages

40:07.001 --> 40:08.083
you're alluding to,

40:11.042 --> 40:12.667
- you know,
- there were text messages

40:14.958 --> 40:17.500
And I f... ed up

40:18.458 --> 40:20.542
- and I f... ing feel horrible
- about it

40:20.583 --> 40:21.750
And it's been eating at me.

40:27.125 --> 40:29.167
Did you cheat on Jessica?

40:32.000 --> 40:33.396
I can't hide it.

40:33.397 --> 40:34.791
Yeah, it's true.

40:34.792 --> 40:35.917
I've never wanted somebody

40:35.958 --> 40:37.124
that didn't want me back.

40:37.125 --> 40:39.042
- I've never loved somebody
- this much,

40:39.083 --> 40:40.708
Where I would be willing

40:40.750 --> 40:41.834
to f... ing shoot myself

40:41.835 --> 40:42.917
in the head

40:42.958 --> 40:44.624
if it f... ing made her happy.

40:44.625 --> 40:46.458
That's how I feel about her.

40:46.500 --> 40:48.417
I don't know, - [stammering]

40:48.458 --> 40:49.604
I want her to see

40:49.605 --> 40:50.750
that the pain I caused her,

40:50.792 --> 40:52.438
I'm willing to take on

40:52.439 --> 40:54.083
100 times more pain

40:54.125 --> 40:55.958
- so that she doesn't feel
- an ounce of the pain

40:55.961 --> 40:57.624
She's feeling anymore,

40:57.625 --> 40:59.042
and I could take it all

40:59.043 --> 41:00.458
from her.

41:00.500 --> 41:04.291
It's f... ing killing me, dude.

41:04.292 --> 41:06.417
Well, first and foremost,

41:06.458 --> 41:08.583
I love you.

41:08.625 --> 41:10.792
I don't... I'm not against you.

41:10.833 --> 41:11.958
I know.

41:17.333 --> 41:19.000
- You're being real
- and I love that

41:19.042 --> 41:20.167
You're being real.

41:20.208 --> 41:21.666
The only thing that I want

41:21.667 --> 41:23.042
is for you and her

41:23.043 --> 41:24.417
to be back together, period.

41:24.458 --> 41:25.500
- Me too.
- That's it.

41:25.503 --> 41:26.666
Me too.

41:26.667 --> 41:27.917
There's a huge piece

41:27.918 --> 41:29.166
of my f... ing heart

41:29.167 --> 41:30.958
that's missing.

41:32.000 --> 41:33.792
I hate myself for doing that

41:35.000 --> 41:36.583
and...

41:37.625 --> 41:39.292
- I'm proud of you.
- Yeah.

41:39.333 --> 41:40.667
- I'm proud of you
- for admitting,

41:40.670 --> 41:41.768
- There's nothing
- to be proud of.

41:41.792 --> 41:42.917
Yeah, there is.

41:42.958 --> 41:43.958
I'm disgusted in myself

41:43.959 --> 41:44.959
for what I did.

41:46.208 --> 41:48.000
- You have to have
- this talk with her.

41:48.003 --> 41:49.563
I don't think you've ever been

41:49.564 --> 41:51.125
this real or raw.

41:52.375 --> 41:53.542
You're not...

41:53.583 --> 41:54.958
You're good at a lot

41:54.959 --> 41:56.333
of things, Mike.

41:56.375 --> 41:58.041
Owning up to your sh...

41:58.042 --> 42:00.375
Takes you a minute.

42:00.417 --> 42:02.207
Do you wanna tell her this?

42:02.208 --> 42:03.833
Open with her?

42:03.834 --> 42:05.458
When I go back, yeah.

42:05.500 --> 42:06.707
I think the whole time,

42:06.708 --> 42:08.021
Mike thought we were gonna

42:08.022 --> 42:09.333
lose respect for him

42:09.375 --> 42:10.958
or we would judge him,

42:11.000 --> 42:12.875
or he would lose some of his,

42:12.917 --> 42:14.230
you know, persian-Jewish

42:14.231 --> 42:15.541
boy luster.

42:15.542 --> 42:17.125
When in all actuality,

42:17.167 --> 42:18.958
he's being accountable,

42:19.000 --> 42:20.813
which is something

42:20.814 --> 42:22.625
that has been so hard for him.

42:22.667 --> 42:24.500
This is a big deal.

42:25.708 --> 42:27.833
This mistake was catastrophic.

42:35.583 --> 42:37.500
Next on shahs of sunset...

42:37.542 --> 42:38.917
- Yeehaw.
- What do you do

42:38.920 --> 42:40.375
When you're in Belize?

42:40.417 --> 42:41.833
You go to the ruins.

42:41.875 --> 42:42.916
Oh my god.

42:42.917 --> 42:44.417
- I'm coming.
- Gg's lagging behind,

42:44.458 --> 42:45.749
Not because of ra.

42:45.750 --> 42:46.833
Is there an elevator?

42:46.875 --> 42:48.250
It's because of her clubbing.

42:48.292 --> 42:49.893
- You're fake as f...
- And everyone's sick

42:49.917 --> 42:51.351
- And tired of your bullsh...
- I'm fake as f...?

42:51.375 --> 42:52.417
- Yes.
- I'm fake as...

42:52.420 --> 42:53.833
- I need to find
- a new medication.

42:53.875 --> 42:55.042
If it's the chemo,

42:55.043 --> 42:56.208
then we do the chemo.

42:56.250 --> 42:57.334
I feel like a piece of me

42:57.335 --> 42:58.416
is missing.

42:58.417 --> 42:59.500
Mike and Jessica

42:59.501 --> 43:00.583
just need a little push.

43:00.625 --> 43:01.916
Make it really beautiful.

43:01.917 --> 43:03.749
[Whistle]

43:03.750 --> 43:04.875
I didn't realize

43:04.876 --> 43:06.000
how serious this was.

43:06.042 --> 43:07.833
Damn, this is for real.

43:07.875 --> 43:10.333
How much can I fake this iv?

43:10.375 --> 43:13.083
I mean, it's not fake.

43:13.125 --> 43:14.417
