WEBVTT

00:07.758 --> 00:10.344
[sighs]
It only took three weeks,

00:10.344 --> 00:13.388
seven hours, four wrenches,
and two school blackouts,

00:13.388 --> 00:16.558
but we have our Storm Impact
Pattern Machine built.

00:16.558 --> 00:19.436
What do you plan on doing
with your first million?

00:19.436 --> 00:22.523
I mean, after SIPMA gets funded
by all the corporations

00:22.523 --> 00:24.608
attending Horizon's Open House.

00:24.608 --> 00:28.028
Let's finish it first
and go yacht shopping later.

00:28.028 --> 00:32.032
But if SIPMA gets funded,
I'm totally buying
a hot‐air balloon.

00:32.032 --> 00:35.494
Ooh. Fancy tastes.
[Peter panting]

00:35.494 --> 00:37.120
Peter, what's wrong?

00:37.120 --> 00:40.123
Not enough hours in the day!
[panting]

00:40.123 --> 00:42.876
Only 24 of them left
until the open house!

00:42.876 --> 00:45.671
Hope your project's ready!

00:45.671 --> 00:47.130
[panting continues]

00:47.130 --> 00:49.049
Endless bad‐guy attacks,

00:49.049 --> 00:52.594
a looming school deadline,
and me without a changing room.

00:53.887 --> 00:56.014
[chuckles]
He must be really far behind.

00:56.014 --> 00:59.226
I haven't seen Peter
this frantic since that
whole Spider Island business.

00:59.226 --> 01:02.145
When every single New Yorker,
including us,

01:02.145 --> 01:03.939
got spider powers...

01:03.939 --> 01:05.440
It was madness.

01:05.440 --> 01:07.401
Luckily,
everybody was cured.

01:07.401 --> 01:10.404
Yeah. Everybody.

01:10.404 --> 01:13.991
Well, Pete should've managed
his time better.

01:13.991 --> 01:16.410
Look at everything we've
accomplished on our project.

01:16.410 --> 01:18.954
With these antennas
set to measure ion‐charged air,

01:18.954 --> 01:21.748
SIPMA should be able to predict
oncoming weather events,

01:21.748 --> 01:24.376
like superstorms,
more effectively
than science can now.

01:24.376 --> 01:27.254
Time to see this baby in action.

01:29.214 --> 01:31.258
[whirring]

01:31.258 --> 01:33.594
Looks beautiful.

01:33.594 --> 01:37.306
And it can all be controlled
by an app on my phone.

01:37.306 --> 01:40.350
Wow. I think this thing
might actually work.

01:40.350 --> 01:42.811
[chuckles]
Yeah!
[chuckles]

01:42.811 --> 01:43.854
Huh?

01:44.938 --> 01:46.565
Wait.

01:46.565 --> 01:49.234
Something's wrong.
Either the machine's broken,

01:49.234 --> 01:52.029
or Midtown's about
to get a tornado.

01:52.029 --> 01:54.114
Ion buildup
on Antenna 4.

01:54.114 --> 01:56.867
[groans]
Your ears just pop?

01:58.452 --> 02:01.163
[Anya]
More like reality just popped.

02:01.163 --> 02:02.456
Aah!

02:02.456 --> 02:04.249
Gwen, Anya,
get out of here!

02:04.249 --> 02:06.209
I don't know how long
I can hold the Spot!

02:06.209 --> 02:08.337
Hold what spot?

02:08.337 --> 02:11.465
Guessing he's talking about
that human Dalmatian.

02:11.465 --> 02:14.635
We gotta call the police.
Avengers. Whatever!

02:14.635 --> 02:16.887
[grunting]
Aah!

02:21.975 --> 02:25.187
[Gwen]
Whoa! This guy
can teleport stuff?

02:25.187 --> 02:27.564
[grunts]
Run!

02:29.274 --> 02:31.735
Too late!

02:44.373 --> 02:45.582
Anya, Gwen, watch out!

02:46.625 --> 02:48.960
Huh? Aah!
[groans]

02:48.960 --> 02:50.253
Time to split!

02:50.253 --> 02:52.798
[all grunt]

02:55.175 --> 02:58.136
"Time to split"?
Did you just make
an atom pun?

02:58.136 --> 03:00.972
The adrenaline.
I couldn't help it.

03:00.972 --> 03:04.685
Get to safety.
A whole string of weird,
new bad guys have been after me.

03:04.685 --> 03:06.061
Huh?
[groans]

03:06.061 --> 03:08.397
Spidey's gonna get slammed.

03:08.397 --> 03:11.233
We can't just call the cops.
They'd never get here in time.

03:11.233 --> 03:12.901
We have to do something.

03:12.901 --> 03:14.486
We both know who could help.

03:14.486 --> 03:18.115
Yeah, us!
Doing what we do best‐‐ science.

03:18.115 --> 03:20.325
That's not what I was‐‐
Come on!

03:20.325 --> 03:23.829
You know the crazy readings
we got right before
the portal popped open?

03:23.829 --> 03:28.250
Those portals probably
charged the air with ions,
which SIPMA can detect.

03:28.250 --> 03:31.128
Hmm. It's still connected.

03:31.128 --> 03:33.213
Let's put your hypothesis
to the test.

03:33.213 --> 03:35.715
There's an ion spike
near Antenna 1.

03:35.715 --> 03:38.677
Open SIPMA's video feed.

03:38.677 --> 03:42.097
Look!
Pop goes the portal.
We can predict

03:42.097 --> 03:43.640
where he's gonna
strike next.

03:43.640 --> 03:45.267
But how does that help?

03:45.267 --> 03:48.311
I've got an idea.

03:48.311 --> 03:51.106
These portals are somehow
created by ion flow, right?

03:51.106 --> 03:53.900
What if instead of just
detecting Spot's portal energy,

03:53.900 --> 03:57.112
we could distort it
by redirecting the ion waves?

03:57.112 --> 03:59.739
Hmm?
Hypothetically possible,

03:59.739 --> 04:02.242
if we had a way to project
the ion pulses.

04:02.242 --> 04:05.871
But we'd have to pump an insane
amount of power into SIPMA.

04:05.871 --> 04:08.331
And I know just the thing.

04:08.331 --> 04:10.417
Come on!
Anya, wait!

04:10.417 --> 04:12.377
If whatever
you're planning fails,

04:12.377 --> 04:14.379
you need to be prepared
to use your‐‐

04:14.379 --> 04:15.797
It won't fail.

04:17.340 --> 04:19.342
[Gwen]
What's up here that's going to‐‐

04:19.342 --> 04:21.261
Oh, the school's
solar grid.

04:21.261 --> 04:23.972
Hello, insane amount of power.

04:23.972 --> 04:27.392
Now to find a way to transmit
the ion pulses.

04:27.392 --> 04:28.977
The sat dish!

04:28.977 --> 04:30.520
Yes!

04:30.520 --> 04:33.023
I love science!

04:33.023 --> 04:35.859
[Spider‐Man]
I hate everything!
[echoing]

04:35.859 --> 04:36.985
[Spider‐Man yelling]

04:36.985 --> 04:38.320
[grunts]

04:39.404 --> 04:41.239
Got the app fired up
and ready.

04:41.239 --> 04:43.492
Hate to think what this
is gonna do to your phone's
data plan.

04:43.492 --> 04:45.243
They offered me unlimited.

04:45.243 --> 04:47.412
I think the company's
gonna regret that.

04:50.207 --> 04:52.375
[whirring]

04:56.171 --> 04:58.840
Fifty percent sync!
Come on already!

04:58.840 --> 05:02.928
I... think... I'm... going...
to... be... sick!

05:02.928 --> 05:05.347
We got sync!
[yelling]

05:05.347 --> 05:07.140
[Anya]
But the Spot's
closing up his portals!

05:07.140 --> 05:09.351
[Gwen]
He could've sent
Spidey anywhere.

05:09.351 --> 05:12.521
Underwater,
the top of a mountain,
deep space...

05:12.521 --> 05:14.940
We can take control
of his portals now, right?

05:14.940 --> 05:17.818
Open them back up.
We have to get Spidey!

05:17.818 --> 05:21.238
Ugh! I can't!
They need to be active.

05:21.238 --> 05:24.241
[Anya]
He's leaving and taking
the portals with him!

05:24.241 --> 05:26.743
Should I...

05:26.743 --> 05:29.913
Yes! Anya,
open his portals again.

05:29.913 --> 05:31.915
You know
what you need to be.

05:32.916 --> 05:35.335
Fine. Amazing it is.

05:35.335 --> 05:38.421
[panting]

05:38.421 --> 05:40.423
[grunting]
[Spider‐Girl]
Hey, Mr. Polka Dot!

05:40.423 --> 05:43.176
We're not through here!
[yells]
[grunts]

05:43.176 --> 05:47.180
Looks like Spider‐Girl
hits the Spot.
[Gwen groans]

05:47.180 --> 05:50.517
Your first line in costume,
and that's what you went with?

05:50.517 --> 05:53.353
What? That was totally
classic battle banter.

05:53.353 --> 05:56.940
[Gwen]
Seriously, cut the puns and get
him to send out his portals!

05:56.940 --> 05:58.942
[both grunting]

06:00.652 --> 06:01.820
[yells]
[grunts]

06:01.820 --> 06:03.363
[grunts]

06:03.363 --> 06:05.282
I'm all the way over here,
Spotty.

06:05.282 --> 06:07.909
How you gonna get me?

06:10.537 --> 06:11.538
[grunts]

06:13.081 --> 06:14.541
Huh?

06:16.418 --> 06:17.377
[grunts]

06:17.377 --> 06:19.504
[groaning]

06:19.504 --> 06:20.505
Aah!

06:20.505 --> 06:21.840
This is way more painful

06:21.840 --> 06:23.717
than Spider‐Man lets on.

06:23.717 --> 06:26.887
Gwen, his portals are active.
Do your thing!

06:26.887 --> 06:29.014
Almost.
[buttons beeping]

06:29.014 --> 06:31.516
Yes! Got it!
Let's see what we can do.
[beeping]

06:31.516 --> 06:33.351
Redirecting portals now.

06:33.351 --> 06:34.686
[grunts]

06:38.148 --> 06:40.609
Time to give him a taste
of his own medicine.

06:40.609 --> 06:42.527
[yelling]

06:42.527 --> 06:44.571
[both grunting]

06:44.571 --> 06:46.573
You've got a neat trick, Spot.

06:46.573 --> 06:48.700
Thought we'd get in
on the action.

06:48.700 --> 06:51.369
Finish him up.
We've gotta get Spidey.

06:51.369 --> 06:53.622
[grunts]

06:53.622 --> 06:55.498
[grunting]

06:55.498 --> 06:57.500
[yells]
[grunts]

06:59.502 --> 07:02.047
[grunts]

07:02.047 --> 07:04.215
Be cool.
Don't freak out.

07:04.215 --> 07:06.843
You just beat your first
bad guy as Spider‐Girl.

07:06.843 --> 07:08.803
No biggie.
[chuckles]

07:08.803 --> 07:10.555
Nice!

07:13.224 --> 07:15.226
Now to get Spidey back.

07:15.226 --> 07:19.272
If I invert the polarity...
[beeping, trilling]

07:19.272 --> 07:23.193
There! I reoriented
one of his portals
via quantum tunneling.

07:23.193 --> 07:26.988
It should take you
to the exact coordinates
where Spidey was sent.

07:29.866 --> 07:32.327
Weird first day, huh?

07:32.327 --> 07:35.622
Yeah. But normal's overrated.

07:37.874 --> 07:41.503
Come on, Spider‐Girl.
I know you got this.

07:44.756 --> 07:47.967
[shivers]
Polar... bears...

07:47.967 --> 07:49.511
[sighs]

07:50.553 --> 07:53.556
[Gwen clears throat]
Spidey, wake up.

07:53.556 --> 07:55.684
[Spider‐Man groans]

07:55.684 --> 07:57.102
[groans]

07:57.102 --> 07:58.895
What happened?

07:58.895 --> 08:01.940
Our machine
was able to take over
the Spot's portals.

08:01.940 --> 08:04.150
No big thing.
Weird.

08:04.150 --> 08:07.237
I could've sworn another
spider person saved me from...

08:07.237 --> 08:08.530
polar bears?

08:08.530 --> 08:10.115
Yeah.

08:10.115 --> 08:12.992
Hypothermic hallucinations
can be very convincing.

08:12.992 --> 08:16.162
Oh, heads‐up.
The police are on their way
to arrest the Spot.

08:16.162 --> 08:20.041
[groans]
The police aren't the biggest
fans of me right now.

08:20.041 --> 08:23.378
Don't know how to thank
you guys enough.
You saved my life.

08:23.378 --> 08:25.296
Saved by science.

08:25.296 --> 08:27.382
It's how we do.

08:27.382 --> 08:29.384
You ever gonna tell him?

08:29.384 --> 08:31.511
What? That I'm
the only person

08:31.511 --> 08:33.513
that kept their powers
after Spider Island

08:33.513 --> 08:36.516
because of the experimental cure
I tested on myself?

08:36.516 --> 08:37.559
Nope.

08:37.559 --> 08:40.395
Why not? It's awesome.

08:40.395 --> 08:43.815
As fun as dressing up
as an arachnid may be,

08:43.815 --> 08:47.569
going to college and running
a tech company someday
is all the adrenaline I need.

08:47.569 --> 08:51.239
Muggers and maniacs
already have enough heroes
to deal with in this city.

08:51.239 --> 08:53.241
What are more webs gonna add?

08:53.241 --> 08:55.702
You know I'll support
whatever you decide.

08:55.702 --> 08:59.622
But I gotta admit,
I'm a little jealous
of those powers of yours.

08:59.622 --> 09:01.708
Plus you got some rad moves.

09:01.708 --> 09:04.461
Could be one of the greats.
Top ten, easy.

09:04.461 --> 09:07.505
[sighs]
Maybe someday.

09:11.342 --> 09:14.304
Twenty‐three hours till
my open house project is due.

09:14.304 --> 09:17.098
[grunts]
Fighting with the Spot
really put a hole in my day.

09:17.098 --> 09:20.351
Whew. Gotta focus...
[mumbles]

09:21.352 --> 09:23.146
Open house project's

09:23.146 --> 09:24.981
almost done... for...

09:24.981 --> 09:26.566
[snores]
[semitruck horn blaring]

09:26.566 --> 09:29.778
[screams, grunts]

09:29.778 --> 09:32.906
Worst alarm clock ever!

09:36.159 --> 09:37.577
[shuddering breath]

09:37.577 --> 09:39.954
Oh, man.
If a near head‐on collision

09:39.954 --> 09:42.916
with a semi doesn't wake me up,
nothing will...

09:42.916 --> 09:44.918
Wait!
Wh‐Where'd the sun go?

09:47.545 --> 09:49.547
But it was just daytime!

09:49.547 --> 09:52.133
I didn't just fall asleep,
did I?

09:52.133 --> 09:55.762
Oh, man. Gotta get back.
Only eight hours left now.

09:56.971 --> 09:59.390
Cut me a break.

09:59.390 --> 10:03.061
Fog's as thick as soup.
Can't even tell which way
Queens is.

10:03.061 --> 10:06.606
And this bridge is never empty.
[rumbling]

10:06.606 --> 10:09.818
What's that rumble?
Sounds like a...

10:09.818 --> 10:11.778
Gah!

10:11.778 --> 10:13.613
[grunts]

10:13.613 --> 10:16.241
A tank?!

10:16.241 --> 10:18.535
I had no idea
that thing was coming.

10:18.535 --> 10:21.704
How did two tons of steel
slip past my spider‐sense?

10:24.040 --> 10:26.334
Plus Hydra agents?!

10:26.334 --> 10:27.794
[weapons firing]

10:27.794 --> 10:30.547
[grunts]
Okay. Guys‐‐

10:30.547 --> 10:33.883
Seriously, why is this
my life right now? Aah!

10:35.426 --> 10:37.887
[grunting]
Let's all just go home.

10:37.887 --> 10:40.974
Have some cocoa.
Read a book.

10:44.102 --> 10:46.771
Huh? What happened?

10:51.818 --> 10:53.361
Get down, soldier!

10:57.240 --> 10:59.450
[grunts]

11:05.832 --> 11:07.667
Captain America?!

11:08.877 --> 11:10.253
Yes.

11:13.047 --> 11:15.758
We've met once,
but you probably don't remember.

11:15.758 --> 11:17.260
I'm a huge fan.

11:17.260 --> 11:20.471
Tony‐‐ I mean, Mr. Stark‐‐
You know, Iron Man‐‐

11:20.471 --> 11:24.726
He ever talk about me?
Spider‐Me? I mean Man.

11:24.726 --> 11:27.812
Speaking of talking, I should‐‐
I'm‐‐ I'm‐‐ I'm just gonna stop.

11:27.812 --> 11:29.939
So...
[clears throat]
Yeah.

11:29.939 --> 11:32.567
What's going on?
[weapons firing]

11:35.320 --> 11:38.781
The world's in danger,
and we need you
in the Avenjet, now!

11:38.781 --> 11:40.074
[whirring]

11:43.620 --> 11:45.914
Whoa! By "we," you mean‐‐

11:45.914 --> 11:47.415
The Avengers. Now go!

11:47.415 --> 11:49.584
Oh, man, oh, man!

11:49.584 --> 11:53.087
Avengers missions
are the best missions!
What about you?

11:53.087 --> 11:56.049
I can't just leave
Captain America high and dry.

11:56.049 --> 11:59.761
We can't waste time.
I'll hold them off
while Black Widow debriefs you.

12:00.762 --> 12:02.764
Yes, sir, Captain, sir!

12:09.020 --> 12:10.313
Yo, Widow!

12:10.313 --> 12:12.315
Long time and all that.

12:12.315 --> 12:15.193
Oh, uh,
was that too casual?

12:15.193 --> 12:17.654
I‐I‐I don't know.
We worked together that once.

12:17.654 --> 12:19.530
I'm not saying
I'm totally memorable.

12:19.530 --> 12:21.741
You probably see
super people every day.
I just‐‐

12:21.741 --> 12:23.743
I‐I should stop talking.

12:23.743 --> 12:27.455
Uh, so, yeah.
What's going on?

12:27.455 --> 12:30.458
More Hydra messiness, huh?

12:30.458 --> 12:31.876
Widow?

12:34.629 --> 12:37.882
That's not normal.
A hologram?

12:37.882 --> 12:41.678
Is this an Avengers'
initiation prank or something?

12:41.678 --> 12:43.888
You guys!

12:43.888 --> 12:46.849
[yelling]

12:46.849 --> 12:49.477
[yelling continues]

12:49.477 --> 12:51.896
[grunts]
Ouch.

12:51.896 --> 12:53.773
Whoa. Wait.

12:53.773 --> 12:56.859
I fell asleep on that bridge.
I'm dreaming, right?

12:56.859 --> 13:00.446
<i>[male voice]</i>
<i>Welcome, Spider‐Man,</i>
<i>to my fun house.</i>

13:00.446 --> 13:02.824
Please, don't let
there be clowns.

13:02.824 --> 13:04.409
Clowns equal un‐fun house.

13:04.409 --> 13:06.995
<i>Allow me to properly</i>
<i>introduce myself.</i>

13:06.995 --> 13:10.665
<i>For I am Mysterio,</i>

13:10.665 --> 13:14.752
<i>Master of Illusion</i>
<i>and dealer of your demise.</i>

13:14.752 --> 13:16.921
Mystery‐who‐now?

13:16.921 --> 13:19.632
<i>Ahead of you are three</i>
<i>pathways of doom.</i>

13:19.632 --> 13:23.177
<i>Come, choose, and see</i>
<i>what's on the other side.</i>

13:23.177 --> 13:25.805
<i>[evil laughter]</i>

13:25.805 --> 13:28.975
Considering there's
no emergency exits,
guess I have to do this.

13:28.975 --> 13:32.520
I don't know, though.
These don't seem
particularly doomy.

13:32.520 --> 13:34.856
I mean, come on.
There's a door
with a kitty theme.

13:34.856 --> 13:38.985
Destruction by kittens
sounds like the most
adorable way to go.

13:38.985 --> 13:40.987
And also a really solid name
for a band.

13:46.075 --> 13:47.869
[all mew]

13:47.869 --> 13:49.871
[purring]

13:49.871 --> 13:53.666
Aww! Talk about
warm and fuzzy overload.

13:53.666 --> 13:55.043
[purring]

13:55.043 --> 13:57.045
[deep growling]

13:57.045 --> 14:00.339
Uh, that cat's meow
is a little rough.

14:00.339 --> 14:02.258
Maybe it's just
fighting a cold.
[growling]

14:03.885 --> 14:05.428
Like a really, really

14:05.428 --> 14:08.222
bad cold.
[roars]

14:08.222 --> 14:09.432
Not a cold!

14:09.432 --> 14:11.851
[yelling]
[roars]

14:13.311 --> 14:15.229
Wait a minute.
This whole night's

14:15.229 --> 14:18.399
been nothing but holograms
and fake Avenjets.

14:18.399 --> 14:22.278
Which explains why that Hydra
tank didn't trigger
my spider‐sense.

14:22.278 --> 14:27.033
[growling]
Ohh, who's just the cutest
man‐eating thing in this room?

14:27.033 --> 14:29.535
That's right. You are.

14:29.535 --> 14:31.788
[chuckles]
I'm not in any real danger,

14:31.788 --> 14:33.790
because you're totally‐‐
[roars]

14:33.790 --> 14:35.917
Ow!

14:35.917 --> 14:37.877
[grunts, groans]

14:37.877 --> 14:40.004
A real man‐eating thing!

14:40.004 --> 14:42.048
Not fake. Not fake!
[growls]

14:42.048 --> 14:44.717
Nice kitty. Nice kitty!
[roars]

14:46.469 --> 14:48.346
[roars]

14:48.346 --> 14:50.348
[grunting]
[roaring]

14:52.308 --> 14:53.976
Yaah!

14:55.770 --> 14:56.896
[snarls]

14:56.896 --> 14:58.439
[grunts]

14:58.439 --> 15:00.608
[both growling]
Oh, cool. More panthers.

15:00.608 --> 15:03.945
And I was thinking this fight
wasn't fair enough.
[all growling]

15:09.826 --> 15:11.953
[grunts]

15:11.953 --> 15:15.289
[sighs]
Another hologram.
[growling continues]

15:15.289 --> 15:19.836
Great. So only one
of these deadly panthers is,
you know, deadly.

15:19.836 --> 15:21.420
Trouble is, which one?

15:21.420 --> 15:24.674
Projection's gotta be
coming from somewhere.
Gotcha!

15:24.674 --> 15:27.718
It's tracking
the two on the left,
which means‐‐

15:27.718 --> 15:30.054
Oh, please be right!

15:30.054 --> 15:32.056
[panthers roar]

15:32.056 --> 15:35.059
Okay. Weird.
Kinda awesome, but still weird.

15:35.059 --> 15:38.813
[growls, roars]
[kitten mews]

15:38.813 --> 15:40.481
Now to get outta here.

15:42.525 --> 15:45.695
Here again?
How can that‐‐

15:45.695 --> 15:49.532
Something tells me
this Mysterio guy is not
gonna be my new best friend.

15:49.532 --> 15:51.993
What I really want is
a big exit sign.

15:51.993 --> 15:55.955
But this door promises
zero saw blades, so...

16:08.176 --> 16:10.720
[chuckles]
This is... great.

16:10.720 --> 16:12.305
Just me, myself, and I.

16:20.021 --> 16:21.063
[thud]
[grunts]

16:21.063 --> 16:22.982
Ouch!

16:22.982 --> 16:25.651
Glad no one saw that.
[whimpers]

16:27.195 --> 16:29.197
This is what J. Jonah
thinks I look like anyway.

16:29.197 --> 16:33.284
Not bad. Maybe I could
go by "Daddy Longlegs."

16:33.284 --> 16:36.204
Watch out, Ant‐Man!
[chuckles]

16:38.164 --> 16:40.249
Whoa! Dead end, I guess.

16:40.249 --> 16:41.500
Uh...

16:41.500 --> 16:42.752
Huh?

16:46.547 --> 16:48.007
Uh...

16:48.007 --> 16:50.843
Sure.
Nothing creepy about this.

16:52.053 --> 16:53.804
[panting]
Okay.

16:53.804 --> 16:56.807
At least that's
a normal reflection‐‐
What?

16:56.807 --> 16:59.977
I have to get outta here.
I feel like I'm losing my mind.

17:02.104 --> 17:03.356
Huh?

17:18.120 --> 17:19.413
Aha! Gotcha!

17:19.413 --> 17:22.041
[grunts]

17:22.041 --> 17:23.709
Stop hitting yourself!

17:23.709 --> 17:26.963
Oh, joy. A reflection of me‐‐
jokes and all.

17:28.714 --> 17:30.508
[yells]

17:30.508 --> 17:33.886
As if I don't already
beat myself up enough.

17:35.596 --> 17:38.015
Okay, that looks
nothing like me.
[grunts]

17:38.015 --> 17:41.143
[grunting]

17:45.398 --> 17:48.067
Take that, robo‐me!

17:49.819 --> 17:53.447
Robotics? Panthers? Holograms?

17:53.447 --> 17:56.993
Mysterio's all illusion.
And felines.

17:56.993 --> 17:59.036
But what does
he want with me?

18:00.663 --> 18:03.291
<i>Two rooms down.</i>
<i>Welcome to number three.</i>

18:03.291 --> 18:06.711
<i>Come find me, Spider‐Man,</i>
<i>if you can make it to the exit.</i>

18:06.711 --> 18:09.463
Finally!
Exit sign, how I love you.
[chuckles]

18:09.463 --> 18:12.258
Just glad I didn't have to
go through the room with the...
saw blades.

18:18.139 --> 18:20.933
If I can predict the paths
of the blades, I can...

18:20.933 --> 18:22.476
Got it!

18:26.856 --> 18:29.108
Talk about cutting it close.

18:29.108 --> 18:32.570
All right. Is there a word
for the opposite of a fun house?

18:33.571 --> 18:36.282
Please be a real exit.

18:37.366 --> 18:39.160
Hmm...

18:45.124 --> 18:47.126
<i>[Mysterio]</i>
<i>Welcome to my domain.</i>

18:47.126 --> 18:50.296
<i>I admit you've progressed</i>
<i>farther than I imagined.</i>

18:50.296 --> 18:53.966
<i>But now, to all good things</i>
<i>must come an end.</i>

18:53.966 --> 18:57.136
<i>For the fortune you gaze upon</i>
<i>is your doom,</i>

18:57.136 --> 19:00.139
<i>at the hands of Mysterio!</i>

19:03.434 --> 19:06.145
Oh, come on!
Nothing? Really?

19:06.145 --> 19:08.397
Do you know how long it took
to perfect that entrance?

19:08.397 --> 19:11.192
[sighs]
Showmanship's a dying art form.

19:11.192 --> 19:13.819
Oh, well.
Good‐bye, Spider‐Man.
[snaps fingers]

19:13.819 --> 19:15.363
Stop‐‐
[screaming]

19:18.157 --> 19:20.201
Hello, payday.

19:20.201 --> 19:22.828
Huh.
That was disappointing.

19:22.828 --> 19:24.372
No witty repartee?

19:24.372 --> 19:28.209
I expected more.
[sighs]

19:28.209 --> 19:30.586
That's a wrap.
[laughs]

19:30.586 --> 19:34.048
And one of my best
performances to date.

19:34.048 --> 19:36.092
[machinery whirring]

19:39.553 --> 19:41.555
Hey, Schmoopy.

19:41.555 --> 19:44.183
The bad man scare you?
[purrs]

19:44.183 --> 19:47.853
I'm sorry.
It's all over now.
[growling]

19:47.853 --> 19:51.399
Oh, I know.
It's mere scraps.

19:51.399 --> 19:55.361
But once I collect
the bounty on Spider‐Man's head,

19:55.361 --> 19:58.906
you'll be feasting
on only the finest filets.

19:58.906 --> 20:01.033
Psst!

20:02.243 --> 20:04.036
Ta‐da!
It‐‐

20:04.036 --> 20:06.497
It can't be.
I destroyed you!

20:06.497 --> 20:08.207
Does this feel
like an illusion?

20:08.207 --> 20:10.334
[yells]
[grunts]

20:10.334 --> 20:11.877
[grunts]

20:11.877 --> 20:14.505
[grunts, groans]

20:14.505 --> 20:16.090
But how?

20:16.090 --> 20:18.384
Please! You think
you're the only one

20:18.384 --> 20:20.886
who knows how
to program a robot?

20:20.886 --> 20:24.140
S‐S‐Stop hitting
[distorted]
yourself.

20:24.140 --> 20:27.017
[static, rattling]
So busy gloating,
you didn't notice the ol'

20:27.017 --> 20:29.937
"switch Spidey
with a robot double
and fool the bad guy" trick.

20:29.937 --> 20:33.274
It can't be.
I was so close
to the brass ring!

20:33.274 --> 20:35.234
The money! The respect!

20:35.234 --> 20:39.155
[whimpers]
Buddy, this can't be
your first time losing.

20:39.155 --> 20:41.115
Take a breath.

20:41.115 --> 20:43.325
So, someone
put a price on <i>moi?</i>

20:43.325 --> 20:45.453
Mind telling me who?
Also, how much?

20:45.453 --> 20:48.539
Curious what an arachnid‐powered
hero goes for in this economy.

20:48.539 --> 20:52.251
A magician
never reveals his‐‐
[crying out]

20:52.251 --> 20:54.837
Yeah, well,
the New York Police Department

20:54.837 --> 20:56.881
will be able to get
some answers out of you.

20:56.881 --> 20:58.632
I'll let them know
you're here.

20:58.632 --> 21:00.718
Where is here, anyway?

21:07.433 --> 21:09.560
Whoa! Wait! 8:36AM?

21:09.560 --> 21:12.229
It's still day?
I only lost half an hour!

21:12.229 --> 21:14.899
Even after dropping
a call to the police,
I still have

21:14.899 --> 21:17.902
over 23 hours to finish
my Horizon Open House project!

21:17.902 --> 21:19.695
[laughs]

21:19.695 --> 21:21.989
Science, here I come!
