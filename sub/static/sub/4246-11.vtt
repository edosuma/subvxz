00:01.644 --> 00:03.761
If that letter from
President Grant was forged,

00:03.795 --> 00:05.062
there will be joint
congressional hearings

00:05.113 --> 00:07.181
- and letters of impeachment.
- Good-bye, Edison.

00:08.316 --> 00:09.733
<i>Previously on "Scandal"...</i>

00:09.767 --> 00:11.267
Which one of you forged his signature?

00:11.302 --> 00:13.870
- I did.
- It's a federal crime. It's treason.

00:13.904 --> 00:16.523
I have a sworn affidavit
saying that your husband

00:16.557 --> 00:19.342
has failed to so much as open his eyes.

00:19.377 --> 00:20.560
(Cell phone rings) Hello?

00:20.594 --> 00:21.911
Hi.

00:21.963 --> 00:23.530
(Voice breaks) Hi.

00:25.232 --> 00:28.134
(Projector and camera shutter clicking)

00:32.104 --> 00:33.072
Oh, hi.

00:33.107 --> 00:34.206
"Oh. Hi"?
(Keys jangle)

00:34.224 --> 00:35.441
Hello, Edison.

00:36.960 --> 00:39.211
Olivia.

00:39.229 --> 00:41.798
- What?
- What's going on? With us.

00:41.832 --> 00:43.682
(Files rustling) Nothing.

00:44.300 --> 00:46.484
- Nothing's going on with us?
- Edison.

00:46.702 --> 00:49.104
This serious boyfriend that you had,

00:49.138 --> 00:50.254
the one that you broke up with...

00:50.273 --> 00:51.490
Look, I have a lot to do tomorrow,

00:51.524 --> 00:53.642
and I haven't had much sleep
and I'm not in the mood to...

00:53.676 --> 00:55.410
This serious boyfriend...
Was it Fitzgerald Grant?

00:57.763 --> 01:00.181
(Chuckles)

01:00.232 --> 01:02.150
You're asking me
if I was in a relationship

01:02.201 --> 01:03.668
- with the President?
- Yes.

01:03.703 --> 01:04.803
- He's married.
- Yes.

01:04.837 --> 01:05.904
- He's the President.
- Yes.

01:05.938 --> 01:07.655
Is this a joke?
Are you kidding?

01:07.690 --> 01:09.074
I'm waiting for you
to answer the question.

01:11.543 --> 01:13.627
You're mad because I wouldn't let you

01:13.662 --> 01:14.912
into the President's hospital room?

01:14.946 --> 01:19.033
Not mad. Concerned.
Wary. Suspicious.

01:19.067 --> 01:21.369
- Don't be. - Because the
President's not your boyfriend?

01:21.403 --> 01:24.438
You really want to stop asking me that.

01:24.689 --> 01:26.356
I've been racking my brain
trying to find a reason

01:26.374 --> 01:28.259
why you'd be stupid enough
to willingly attempt

01:28.293 --> 01:29.727
to defraud the American people,

01:29.761 --> 01:31.295
and the only reason I can come up with

01:31.329 --> 01:32.563
for why you'd be in so deep

01:32.597 --> 01:35.031
is because you were his mistress.

01:35.066 --> 01:39.002
Five...
that's sexist and insulting.

01:39.036 --> 01:40.954
You'd never suggest Scooter Libby

01:40.988 --> 01:42.539
was screwing Dick Cheney.

01:42.573 --> 01:45.225
Four... the lengths you're going
to try to twist this

01:45.276 --> 01:47.210
into a conspiracy are
cause for concern.

01:47.245 --> 01:48.745
You should speak to someone about that.

01:48.763 --> 01:51.214
Three... the President
is awake and talking,

01:51.249 --> 01:54.201
and the suggestion that he isn't
is partisan political crap

01:54.235 --> 01:57.053
that I thought you had
enough integrity to rise above.

01:57.087 --> 01:58.838
Two...
in the past three minutes,

01:58.872 --> 02:00.740
you've called me a criminal, a whore,

02:00.774 --> 02:02.442
an idiot, and a liar,

02:02.476 --> 02:04.744
so this is pretty much the
last time we'll be speaking,

02:04.795 --> 02:07.730
so one... who I am or
am <i>not</i> screwing,

02:07.765 --> 02:09.131
what am or am not doing,

02:09.149 --> 02:12.251
is no longer any of your damn business.

02:12.286 --> 02:14.420
You forget how well I know you.

02:14.455 --> 02:17.623
You this angry?
You have something to hide.

02:17.658 --> 02:19.142
I have been summoned to a meeting

02:19.176 --> 02:21.210
at the white house tomorrow
with acting President Langston

02:21.245 --> 02:22.645
about the letter of reinstatement,

02:22.679 --> 02:24.981
which she says is a forgery.
(Scoffs)

02:25.015 --> 02:26.866
And she's going to tell that
to the entire cabinet

02:26.917 --> 02:28.684
first thing in the morning.

02:28.718 --> 02:31.220
So if there's something
that you want to tell me,

02:31.255 --> 02:34.856
do it now, when I still
have time to help you.

02:52.742 --> 02:55.677
Cyrus, we have a problem.

sync and corrections by bellows
www.addic7ed.com

03:02.218 --> 03:04.352
Increasing our military
presence in Asia

03:04.386 --> 03:05.770
costs money, Governor.

03:05.804 --> 03:08.189
Which is why we'd have to
shift our defense spend...

03:08.223 --> 03:10.091
Can't just run to daddy
and ask for the dough

03:10.125 --> 03:11.792
on this one.
(Laughter)

03:11.810 --> 03:13.127
(Lowered voice) Use the attack line.
Attack line.

03:13.145 --> 03:15.430
Go to my web site.
Look at my spending plans.

03:15.464 --> 03:17.131
- Do the math.
- Oh, no.

03:17.149 --> 03:18.683
Now he's giving the voters homework.

03:18.734 --> 03:20.518
Fiscal budget, we can afford to
make this common reallocation.

03:20.569 --> 03:21.769
I'm sorry, Governor.
We have to move on.

03:21.787 --> 03:23.004
I deserve a chance to respond.

03:23.039 --> 03:25.072
You think you deserve
everything, don't you, Governor?

03:25.107 --> 03:26.524
(Laughter)
No... (Chuckles)

03:26.575 --> 03:28.276
No. If we could get
back to medicare.

03:28.310 --> 03:29.610
Look. Look.
Governor Reston...

03:29.644 --> 03:31.145
- I can't.
- Tell me when it's over.

03:31.163 --> 03:33.664
You need 270 electoral
college votes to win, right?

03:33.699 --> 03:36.451
And you've got 188 locked up
from the deep red states.

03:36.485 --> 03:38.002
So you need a pickup of 82 votes,

03:38.036 --> 03:40.288
most likely from a combination of Ohio,

03:40.322 --> 03:43.040
Florida, Virginia, Colorado,
Nevada, North Carolina.

03:43.091 --> 03:46.127
So, basically, you can't afford
to lose more than one of them.

03:46.161 --> 03:47.995
- And if I do?
- You're toast.

03:48.013 --> 03:49.647
Did the debate move the needle at all?

03:49.681 --> 03:52.166
Not in your favor.
I'm sorry, Governor.

03:52.184 --> 03:54.101
Numbers don't lie.

03:55.271 --> 03:56.155
(Projector and camera shutter clicks)

03:56.189 --> 03:59.140
As the individual helping
finance this little enterprise,

03:59.174 --> 04:01.643
I'd like to start feeling like
I'm getting my money's worth.

04:01.677 --> 04:03.111
We've still got a month left.

04:03.145 --> 04:04.345
Plenty of time to turn things around.

04:04.363 --> 04:05.513
That's just whistlin'
past the graveyard.

04:05.531 --> 04:08.033
- We need to do something.
- You have a suggestion?

04:08.067 --> 04:10.018
Stack the deck.

04:10.036 --> 04:12.153
I found a computer nerd of my own,

04:12.187 --> 04:14.656
says he can rig the election
for Grant, easy as pie.

04:14.690 --> 04:16.541
- Very funny.
- Am I laughing?

04:16.575 --> 04:18.326
(Lowered voice) Okay.
You saying "rig the election"

04:18.360 --> 04:21.880
on a campaign plane is like
joking that you have a bomb

04:21.914 --> 04:23.548
in the security line at the airport.

04:23.582 --> 04:25.366
You don't do it unless
you want to end up

04:25.384 --> 04:28.169
having your body cavities
searched by big men with guns.

04:28.203 --> 04:30.138
Whoa.
Just trying to help.

04:30.172 --> 04:32.874
We got a problem.
I am a solution man.

04:32.892 --> 04:34.009
Your solution is a felony.

04:34.043 --> 04:35.343
Well, then,
you're the fix-it gal.

04:35.377 --> 04:36.728
Quit bitchin' and start pitchin'.

04:36.762 --> 04:38.930
(Clears throat)
Those numbers are fatal.

04:38.981 --> 04:40.932
(Clears throat)
What this campaign needs

04:40.983 --> 04:43.601
is a big pointy boot
to kick it square in the ass.

04:43.652 --> 04:45.403
I was thinking... (Sighs)

04:45.438 --> 04:47.906
Maybe it's time we brought in help.

04:47.940 --> 04:50.108
- He's not gonna like it.
- He will learn to like it.

04:50.110 --> 04:50.994
We talking about Jerry?

04:51.028 --> 04:53.028
Fitz's father?
That's... that's brilliant.

04:53.029 --> 04:54.496
I wondered why he wasn't on the trail.

04:54.530 --> 04:56.331
I figured maybe his health wasn't good.

04:56.365 --> 04:57.866
(Cyrus) Oh, it's good.

04:57.900 --> 04:59.334
The good senator
Fitzgerald Thomas Grant II's

04:59.368 --> 05:01.169
gonna bury us all.

05:01.203 --> 05:03.755
Fitz has been very clear
about his father.

05:03.789 --> 05:05.390
He'll never agree to it.

05:05.424 --> 05:06.524
That was then.

05:06.559 --> 05:08.242
This is 10 points down.

05:08.260 --> 05:09.761
(Projector and camera shutter clicking)

05:09.795 --> 05:11.930
No! You know better!
You know!

05:11.964 --> 05:13.431
We are losing!
We are lost!

05:13.466 --> 05:14.933
I can win this on my own!

05:14.967 --> 05:17.602
You have political capital!
You need to start spending it!

05:17.636 --> 05:19.721
(Lowered voice) I need to
point out voices carry.

05:19.755 --> 05:21.756
(Sighs) You might want to
either lower the volume

05:21.774 --> 05:24.609
or continue this
conversation in a room.

05:26.112 --> 05:28.229
You talk to him.
He actually listens to you.

05:28.263 --> 05:32.266
(Beep, door opens and slams)

05:41.009 --> 05:42.644
(Panting)

05:42.678 --> 05:44.045
Fitz...
Mm?

05:44.080 --> 05:45.780
We're all concerned that
the campaign needs a spark.

05:45.798 --> 05:47.548
Your father could be it.

05:47.566 --> 05:51.552
And I really don't want to
discuss my father right now.

05:51.686 --> 05:52.270
(Exhales) Mm.

05:53.004 --> 05:54.189
Your father...

05:55.223 --> 05:56.590
Is a national treasure.

05:56.625 --> 05:58.559
Self-made man,
two terms as...

05:58.593 --> 06:00.477
Governor, 4-time senator.
I know.

06:00.528 --> 06:02.546
The image of him passing on
the torch to his son...

06:02.581 --> 06:05.032
That will ignite the base.
The press loves him.

06:05.066 --> 06:06.667
Everyone loves him.

06:06.701 --> 06:08.786
<i>I</i> don't want him here.

06:10.989 --> 06:12.372
He can help.

06:12.390 --> 06:15.009
You need help right now.

06:17.796 --> 06:20.064
You really think we're at that place?

06:20.098 --> 06:21.715
We're at that place.

06:23.417 --> 06:24.669
If I say yes,

06:26.804 --> 06:28.271
will you stop talking
about the campaign

06:28.305 --> 06:29.655
for the next 20 minutes?

06:29.689 --> 06:31.090
Why?

06:32.726 --> 06:34.860
Hmm...

06:37.931 --> 06:39.149
(Gasps)

06:40.100 --> 06:41.851
The bullet tore
through your frontal lobe.

06:41.885 --> 06:43.853
We managed the swelling,
and with any luck,

06:43.887 --> 06:45.705
the effects you see will be minimal.

06:45.739 --> 06:46.939
Effects such as?

06:46.973 --> 06:48.474
Dizziness, fatigue, irritability.

06:48.509 --> 06:50.493
The symptoms we commonly
associate with concussions.

06:50.527 --> 06:52.211
And if they're not?

06:52.246 --> 06:54.147
Our frontal lobes
control executive function.

06:54.181 --> 06:55.965
So sometimes in patients we've seen

06:55.999 --> 06:58.034
an inability to make decisions,
a shorter attention span.

06:58.068 --> 06:59.669
We've had patients who
haven't been able to write,

06:59.703 --> 07:01.304
patients who suffer from aphasia.

07:01.338 --> 07:02.922
- Aphasia?
- Speech impairment?

07:02.956 --> 07:04.240
Either you can't speak
at all, or if you can,

07:04.274 --> 07:06.292
it's hard to find your words.

07:06.326 --> 07:09.028
We'll also be on the lookout
for changes in personality.

07:09.063 --> 07:10.696
It all depends on the patient.

07:11.231 --> 07:12.715
That's why I want to get
a neurology team in here pronto

07:12.749 --> 07:14.600
- and see where we are.
- So when can I get back to work?

07:14.634 --> 07:16.435
Assuming there's no permanent
damage, three weeks.

07:16.469 --> 07:17.703
(Sighs)

07:17.737 --> 07:19.605
Walking across a room
will feel like a marathon.

07:19.639 --> 07:21.790
(Knock on door) Am I interrupting?

07:21.841 --> 07:23.225
Thank you, doctor.

07:23.260 --> 07:26.412
<i>(Woman speaking</i>
<i>indistinctly over P.A.)</i>

07:26.446 --> 07:27.913
(Door closes) What is it?

07:27.948 --> 07:31.800
I'm afraid we have
a Sally Langston problem.

07:33.035 --> 07:34.636
(Projector and camera shutter clicking)

07:34.671 --> 07:35.837
The letter of reinstatement

07:35.872 --> 07:37.272
submitted on behalf of President Grant

07:37.306 --> 07:40.074
was entirely premature.

07:40.125 --> 07:42.927
Regrettably, he is not
in any sort of condition

07:42.945 --> 07:45.080
to resume the powers
and responsibilities

07:45.114 --> 07:48.099
of this office at this time.

07:48.134 --> 07:51.736
Understanding, as always,
that our first and only duty

07:51.771 --> 07:53.755
is to the American people,

07:53.806 --> 07:57.909
I have prepared a document
for your signatures

07:57.943 --> 08:00.328
declaring that we are left no choice

08:00.362 --> 08:03.014
but to challenge President
Grant's fitness...(Door opens)

08:03.048 --> 08:04.365
To again assume...

08:07.870 --> 08:08.986
Morning, everyone.

08:11.123 --> 08:12.841
Sorry I'm late.

08:18.887 --> 08:20.355
Are we sure this was a good idea?

08:20.406 --> 08:21.522
He's just gonna show his face,
shake a few hands,

08:21.573 --> 08:22.874
hear ten minutes of the briefing,

08:22.908 --> 08:23.941
and go back to bed,

08:23.959 --> 08:25.960
and Sally disappears forever

08:25.995 --> 08:28.680
into that political black hole
called the vice presidency.

08:28.714 --> 08:30.431
- He's looking great!
- Guy's a medical miracle.

08:30.466 --> 08:33.868
Madame vice President,
how are you today?

08:36.355 --> 08:38.722
(Laughs) (Laughs)

08:38.741 --> 08:41.558
That was small of me.
I need to work on that. (Chuckles)

08:42.993 --> 08:44.295
I need a fresh shirt.

08:45.330 --> 08:46.847
Ask Izzie to send one down for me.

08:46.881 --> 08:48.182
Why don't you we get you up to bed?

08:48.216 --> 08:49.600
I have to get down to the sit room.

08:49.634 --> 08:51.168
Fitz, you did it.
You're back.

08:51.202 --> 08:53.036
You're President.
You have nothing to prove.

08:53.054 --> 08:54.955
Until Sally Langston
puts a letter on my desk

08:54.989 --> 08:58.141
accepting my reinstatement,
I have everything to prove.

08:58.159 --> 08:59.843
Have I thanked you for that,
by the way?

08:59.878 --> 09:01.078
For forging my signature

09:01.112 --> 09:02.496
and forcing me out of the hospital

09:02.530 --> 09:03.697
before my stitches had healed

09:03.732 --> 09:05.683
to save you from jail and keep my job?

09:05.717 --> 09:07.935
Thank you.

09:07.969 --> 09:10.621
(Sighs)

09:11.555 --> 09:13.222
I can't show any weakness.

09:13.257 --> 09:14.641
This is not a show of weakness.

09:14.675 --> 09:17.310
You were shot. You've made
a miraculous recovery.

09:17.361 --> 09:19.112
No one is expecting you
to spend five hours

09:19.146 --> 09:20.496
in a military briefing.

09:20.531 --> 09:23.549
Sally Langston
is dancing around the fire.

09:23.584 --> 09:27.353
She's not gonna stop
until my head's on a stick.

09:27.404 --> 09:29.589
They need to see me, not her,

09:29.623 --> 09:32.125
being commander-in-chief
of the armed forces.

09:32.159 --> 09:34.977
I need a clean shirt.

09:35.295 --> 09:36.846
And that's the difference

09:36.880 --> 09:37.997
between Governor Reston and me.

09:39.231 --> 09:41.500
My plan provides for $2 trillion
in discretionary spending.

09:41.551 --> 09:43.101
Just say "spending cuts."

09:43.136 --> 09:45.003
"Discretionary" confuses people.

09:45.054 --> 09:47.455
$2 trillion in spending cuts,

09:47.490 --> 09:49.891
which will save Americans money

09:49.909 --> 09:51.409
and stimulate growth.

09:51.443 --> 09:55.196
Ah, to hell with spending cuts!
I want my taxes lowered!

09:55.231 --> 09:56.964
(People murmuring) We titans
of industry built this nation.

09:56.982 --> 09:59.017
We deserve to get a little relief

09:59.051 --> 10:01.186
in these difficult economic times.

10:01.220 --> 10:04.856
Everybody seems to forget
that the rich need help, too.

10:04.890 --> 10:07.442
Boy, that sounded better in my head

10:07.476 --> 10:08.710
than it did out loud, didn't it?
(Laughter)

10:08.744 --> 10:10.845
Jerry! (Laughing)
(Laughing)

10:10.863 --> 10:12.213
We are so glad that you came.

10:12.248 --> 10:13.398
Anything for you.
Oh.

10:13.432 --> 10:15.033
Mwah!
(Laughs)

10:15.067 --> 10:16.835
Good to see you, Jer.

10:16.869 --> 10:18.853
- Hello, Fitzgerald.
- Dad.

10:21.039 --> 10:22.956
Everybody, why don't we take a break?

10:22.991 --> 10:25.809
No, no, no. Keep working.
I'm just furniture.

10:25.844 --> 10:27.611
(People murmuring)

10:27.662 --> 10:28.929
Hello.

10:28.963 --> 10:30.664
(Man) - Good to see you, Jerry.
- Hi.

10:30.682 --> 10:32.049
Where was I?

10:32.083 --> 10:34.768
(Olivia) Uh, save Americans
money, stimulate growth.

10:34.802 --> 10:37.471
Save Americans money
and stimulate growth

10:37.505 --> 10:39.239
while reducing the national debt

10:39.274 --> 10:41.608
by $5 trillion over the next 10 years

10:41.643 --> 10:43.293
from a deficit that right now increases

10:43.328 --> 10:46.730
by an average of
$3.68 billion a d...

10:46.764 --> 10:49.265
Wait, wait, this isn't a funeral, son.

10:49.299 --> 10:51.717
Perk up! You got the looks.
Add the charm. (Chuckles)

10:51.752 --> 10:54.936
- <i>As</i> I was saying...
(Jerry) - Okay, go on.

10:54.955 --> 10:59.690
$5 trillion from a deficit
that right now increases

10:59.691 --> 11:02.911
by an average
of $3.68 billion a day.

11:02.963 --> 11:04.129
A day.

11:04.147 --> 11:05.564
When I am President, I would...

11:05.598 --> 11:08.033
Uh, no, no, no. Nobody wants
to hear all that math.

11:08.067 --> 11:09.918
Here.
Let me show you how it's done.

11:09.970 --> 11:11.720
Up, up, up!

11:11.755 --> 11:13.572
(People murmuring)

11:13.607 --> 11:15.841
Pleasure. (Sighs)

11:15.875 --> 11:19.878
All right, sweetheart.
Feed it to me.

11:23.483 --> 11:26.935
- A lot of people think this election
is about the economy. - Mm-hmm.

11:27.470 --> 11:28.953
Tell us what differentiates
your economic plan

11:28.971 --> 11:30.522
from Governor Reston's.

11:30.556 --> 11:35.844
A mother is standing
on the sidewalk, choking.

11:35.878 --> 11:38.430
She's, uh, swallowed
a penny accidentally,

11:38.464 --> 11:40.632
and it's lodged in her throat.

11:40.666 --> 11:42.918
A man in a suit comes by,

11:42.952 --> 11:46.020
gives her the heimlich,
and out pops the penny.

11:46.155 --> 11:47.939
Well, the... the woman says...

11:47.973 --> 11:49.874
(Mouths words) "Gosh darn,

11:49.908 --> 11:51.859
I can't thank you enough."

11:51.894 --> 11:53.878
And the guy in the suit said...

11:54.313 --> 11:56.881
(Chuckles) "Oh...
Oh, no, I'm not a doctor.

11:56.915 --> 11:58.499
I'm from the I.R.S.

11:58.533 --> 12:00.685
and he snatched the penny
and he ran off.

12:00.719 --> 12:03.837
That's what's gonna happen
if this guy wins the election.

12:03.871 --> 12:06.959
Next question.
(Laughter and applause)

12:06.993 --> 12:09.745
(People laughing hysterically)

12:09.778 --> 12:11.978
(Jerry) No! No!
That's not the best part.

12:11.979 --> 12:15.766
I come back from Nevada
after watching them test

12:15.800 --> 12:19.569
a hydrogen bomb, and I see
these bruises on my chest.

12:19.603 --> 12:21.921
So I go to an oncologist, and I say,

12:21.972 --> 12:23.423
"look at these bruises!

12:23.457 --> 12:25.625
"I think I've been exposed
to radiation.

12:25.659 --> 12:27.026
What should I do?"

12:27.061 --> 12:28.878
And he looks at me
and he looks at my bruises,

12:28.912 --> 12:31.514
and he says, "Nevada?"
And I go, "yeah."

12:31.532 --> 12:33.733
He goes, "Jerry, that's
from leaning too hard

12:33.767 --> 12:35.001
against the craps table."

12:35.035 --> 12:36.185
(Laughter)

12:36.219 --> 12:38.087
No, Verna was there.
She remembers.

12:38.121 --> 12:40.306
- Well, I was more of a poker girl.
(Jerry) - Ah!

12:40.341 --> 12:42.292
I bet she was.
(Laughter)

12:42.326 --> 12:44.310
So when do you hit Florida?

12:44.361 --> 12:46.162
Thursday.
You think you can join us, Jer?

12:46.196 --> 12:48.765
- Hey...
(Fitz) - No.

12:49.699 --> 12:52.367
You stump in Oregon.
I'll handle Florida myself.

12:52.402 --> 12:54.553
(Laughs) Son...

12:54.587 --> 12:55.938
Oh, no. You need me
in Florida.

12:55.972 --> 12:57.239
No, I don't.

12:57.273 --> 12:59.124
These young boys today.

12:59.158 --> 13:00.709
They think they invented politics.

13:00.727 --> 13:02.644
(Chuckling) We definitely
want you in Florida.

13:02.662 --> 13:04.496
Did I say I want him in Florida?

13:04.530 --> 13:06.765
(Mouths words) Look, I realize
you don't think I know anything,

13:06.799 --> 13:08.867
but I've done more in the past 20 years

13:08.902 --> 13:11.220
than you'll do in an entire lifetime.

13:11.254 --> 13:13.222
You'll want me in Florida.

13:13.256 --> 13:16.942
Unless you want to lose.
Do you want to lose, son?

13:16.976 --> 13:18.377
(Scoffs)

13:22.966 --> 13:25.033
(Swallows and sighs)

13:25.968 --> 13:27.985
We'd be glad to have you.

13:28.020 --> 13:29.887
So can I ask about
your campaign strategy?

13:29.922 --> 13:31.572
No.

13:31.590 --> 13:34.408
Honey. Why didn't you dig enough
dirt on Reston? (Liquid pouring)

13:35.042 --> 13:37.594
We've had a clean campaign so far.

13:37.629 --> 13:40.564
Fitz wants to keep it that way.
I think it's admirable.

13:40.598 --> 13:43.316
Well, I think it's weak.
You want to win the presidency,

13:43.334 --> 13:46.220
you have to attack, be strong.
Finish off your competition!

13:46.254 --> 13:47.871
- You know this from experience?
- Fitz.

13:47.906 --> 13:49.656
No, dad's giving me advice.
I'm just wondering

13:49.691 --> 13:52.543
if it's from his vast experience
running for President.

13:52.577 --> 13:54.178
Oh, yeah, you never ran, did you?

13:54.712 --> 13:57.180
'Cause men who get caught
sleeping with prostitutes

13:57.231 --> 13:58.665
don't get to be leader
of the free world.

13:58.699 --> 14:00.483
Right?

14:00.518 --> 14:01.635
Who wants coffee?

14:01.669 --> 14:04.038
What was her name? Charity?
No, it was Hope.

14:05.072 --> 14:08.041
Hard to forget that name.

14:08.075 --> 14:09.893
You really kept hope alive,
didn't you, dad?

14:09.927 --> 14:11.578
- Fitz.
- No, Hope is alive.

14:11.612 --> 14:13.363
Mom's dead, though.

14:13.397 --> 14:15.865
(Mellie) - Enough.
(Fitz sighs)

14:15.900 --> 14:17.367
(Sets down glass)

14:17.901 --> 14:20.219
Jerry, I'm so sorry.

14:20.237 --> 14:21.654
It's fine.

14:21.688 --> 14:24.257
We have all had a long day. Hmm?

14:24.291 --> 14:27.026
And I think I'm gonna turn in.

14:27.060 --> 14:28.611
Mwah! (Kisses)
Mm.

14:28.645 --> 14:30.646
Mm. Mm.
(Chuckles and kisses)

14:32.566 --> 14:34.967
(Lowered voice) We'll talk
about this in the morning.

14:41.608 --> 14:43.876
(Elevator bell dings)

14:43.910 --> 14:45.261
(Sighs and mutters)

14:46.095 --> 14:48.947
(Indistinct conversations)
(Clears throat)

14:53.052 --> 14:54.453
You didn't wait for me.

14:54.487 --> 14:57.356
It's late.
We can talk in the morning.

14:57.390 --> 15:00.325
Or we can go to your room, talk there.

15:01.661 --> 15:03.178
Or...

15:03.212 --> 15:04.829
Not talk.
(Sighs)

15:04.847 --> 15:06.698
Fitz, you're drunk.

15:06.733 --> 15:09.034
And you're sad.

15:09.068 --> 15:10.502
You should get to bed.

15:10.520 --> 15:12.354
(Slurring) - I'm trying to get to bed.
- Stop it.

15:12.388 --> 15:14.906
Come on.
Really, no. No.

15:14.940 --> 15:16.558
You want to talk, we can talk.

15:16.609 --> 15:19.628
We can get a cup of coffee, you can
sober up, but... mnh-mnh. Mnh.

15:19.679 --> 15:21.313
(Stammering) No...
Come on.

15:21.347 --> 15:23.081
(Elevator bell dings) Stop it.

15:23.115 --> 15:24.549
Fitzgerald.

15:24.584 --> 15:26.318
(Head thuds) Oh...

15:26.352 --> 15:28.470
(Sighs)

15:28.504 --> 15:30.372
Um...

15:32.958 --> 15:35.176
I'm sorry. I'm...

15:36.027 --> 15:37.411
Sorry.

15:39.931 --> 15:42.116
(Sighs)

15:44.302 --> 15:46.070
Mellie...

15:46.104 --> 15:47.738
I wanted to apologize for Fitz.

15:47.772 --> 15:51.342
That's not like him, but he
has had too much to drink.

15:51.376 --> 15:53.360
And he has always had
problems with his father,

15:53.395 --> 15:55.913
and I just...

15:55.947 --> 15:58.982
He respects you.
He needs you.

15:59.000 --> 16:01.485
We both do, and...

16:01.503 --> 16:05.556
I just don't want
what happened here tonight...

16:06.925 --> 16:09.660
I'm so sorry.
I am.

16:09.678 --> 16:12.596
I know how you must feel,
and I am so sorry.

16:12.631 --> 16:14.598
It's okay.

16:14.633 --> 16:17.051
Really.
I'm fine.

16:17.102 --> 16:19.436
You don't have to apologize to me.

16:19.471 --> 16:21.388
I don't know what he'd do without you.

16:21.439 --> 16:23.840
I don't know what <i>I</i>
would do without you. (Chuckles)

16:24.074 --> 16:25.408
(Breathes deeply)

16:35.424 --> 16:36.924
(Projector and camera shutter clicking)

16:36.958 --> 16:40.044
The trouble with precision air
strikes is they're not precise.

16:40.078 --> 16:41.295
There's too much collateral damage.

16:41.330 --> 16:43.781
Again, I think we should
have a S.E.A.L. team go in

16:43.815 --> 16:45.683
and either capture or kill...

17:14.527 --> 17:15.527
Kinyazi.

17:19.833 --> 17:23.002
The east Sudan leader.

17:23.036 --> 17:25.588
Send in a S.E.A.L. team
to capture or kill Kinyazi.

17:25.622 --> 17:26.972
Yes, exactly.

17:29.292 --> 17:30.526
Thank you all.

17:30.960 --> 17:32.511
Mr. President.
Mr. President.

17:41.003 --> 17:42.287
(Projector and camera shutter clicking)

17:42.321 --> 17:45.290
There's no such thing as a
clean campaign! (Sighs)

17:45.341 --> 17:47.008
It's an oxymoron!

17:47.042 --> 17:48.143
From now on, you're...

17:48.177 --> 17:49.644
There's still time to call Hollis.

17:49.679 --> 17:51.179
It's the only way
that you're gonna win this!

17:51.214 --> 17:52.780
We don't have to put up with this.
(Shouting continues)

17:52.798 --> 17:54.866
So we rig an election instead, Cyrus?

17:54.901 --> 17:56.968
I'm just saying it's an option.

17:57.019 --> 17:59.437
I'm kidding.
(Door opens)

18:01.488 --> 18:02.907
My son and I have had a talk.

18:02.958 --> 18:05.426
We're gonna need oppo
on Reston. Everything...

18:05.461 --> 18:06.978
S.A.T. scores,
parking tickets.

18:07.012 --> 18:08.780
If he didn't put the seat down once,

18:08.831 --> 18:10.832
- we want to hear about it.
- Sir, with all due respect...

18:11.566 --> 18:13.467
As I said before, we've been
running a clean campaign

18:13.501 --> 18:14.868
since the primary.

18:14.903 --> 18:16.836
Well, now I'm telling you
to get me some dirt

18:16.871 --> 18:18.371
that we can pin on Reston.

18:18.406 --> 18:20.540
- Sir, we don't work for you.
- We work for the Governor.

18:20.574 --> 18:22.659
(Scoffs)

18:22.693 --> 18:26.012
- Do we bring pillows to a
knife fight, son? - No, sir.

18:26.047 --> 18:28.081
- Do we wanna run a real campaign?
- Yes, sir.

18:28.115 --> 18:29.883
There you go.

18:31.502 --> 18:33.536
Do what he says.

18:36.857 --> 18:38.425
(Projector and camera shutter clicking)

18:39.059 --> 18:40.242
Harrison Wright, Abby Whelan.

18:40.277 --> 18:41.927
The pleasure's all mine.
Hi.

18:41.961 --> 18:43.779
Hi. Listen, we gotta
make this quick.

18:43.814 --> 18:45.965
I got a meeting with the parole
officer in half an hour.

18:45.999 --> 18:47.516
(Breathes deeply)

18:47.551 --> 18:49.035
(Door opens) Oh, God.

18:49.069 --> 18:50.836
Oh.

18:50.854 --> 18:52.438
I think he's coming over here.

18:52.472 --> 18:55.758
(Murmuring)

18:57.160 --> 18:58.728
I'm Huck.

19:00.814 --> 19:02.464
I brought you all here
to dig up some dirt

19:02.499 --> 19:03.932
on the Reston campaign...

19:04.167 --> 19:06.101
Disgruntled ex-girlfriends,
old coworkers...

19:06.152 --> 19:08.553
Whatever we can find.
The dirtier, the better.

19:08.588 --> 19:10.255
(Projector and camera shutter clicking)
- So this is politics, huh?

19:10.289 --> 19:11.957
(Olivia) - What about
Mrs. Reston's accounts?

19:11.990 --> 19:12.990
(Huck) Clean.

19:12.991 --> 19:14.576
(Abby) So have you known
the restons a long time?

19:14.627 --> 19:16.645
(Harrison) Talk to me.
What haven't they uncovered?

19:16.679 --> 19:19.214
He was a rager. Crashed his car into
a tree after a Christmas party.

19:19.248 --> 19:20.982
Excellent.
The only witness is a loyal,

19:21.017 --> 19:22.100
and there's no public record, so...

19:22.134 --> 19:23.735
So dead intel.
Abby?

19:23.769 --> 19:25.453
He was a man-whore.
With a temper.

19:25.488 --> 19:29.223
- How bad? - He had a bevy of
pi-phis at his Beck and call.

19:29.257 --> 19:30.607
Lots of them are still bitter

19:30.625 --> 19:32.076
about his less-than-chivalrous
dating style.

19:32.110 --> 19:34.195
But then he met Joan and mellowed out.

19:34.229 --> 19:35.613
(Projector and camera shutter clicking)
Stayed true, as far as I can tell.

19:35.647 --> 19:37.598
- When did he meet Joan?
- '87.

19:37.649 --> 19:38.866
Around the same time he quit drinking.

19:38.917 --> 19:42.903
You know, perhaps we need
more experienced and...

19:42.954 --> 19:44.455
House-trained people
on this.

19:44.473 --> 19:46.857
Sir, these people...
No more excuses.

19:46.892 --> 19:48.843
If we don't get something on Reston,

19:48.877 --> 19:50.494
something that sticks,
we may just as well

19:50.512 --> 19:52.296
pull all of our ads, pack up camp.

19:52.314 --> 19:54.382
Fitzgerald can't pull this
off on his own.

19:54.416 --> 19:55.999
You know it and I know it.

19:57.118 --> 19:59.269
(Projector and camera shutter clicks)

19:59.303 --> 20:01.588
We put all the lipstick
we can on this pig.

20:01.622 --> 20:03.356
It's time to pony up
and seriously consider

20:03.407 --> 20:05.742
all the options.
There are no options, Hollis.

20:05.776 --> 20:08.428
Yes, there are.
I'm not saying I agree with it,

20:08.479 --> 20:10.246
but we should discuss it.

20:10.281 --> 20:12.432
(Lowered voice) Election rigging
is not an option.

20:12.966 --> 20:15.851
(Lowered voice) I'm talking
about doing a patriotic thing.

20:15.886 --> 20:17.486
You're not serious.

20:17.521 --> 20:19.055
I may be a son of a bitch,
but Fitz is clean as a whistle.

20:19.089 --> 20:20.156
Am I right, Cyrus?

20:24.460 --> 20:25.944
He's the real deal.

20:25.978 --> 20:28.597
A patriot.
A believer.

20:28.631 --> 20:31.316
How rare is that?
How often does that come along?

20:31.351 --> 20:33.585
Once in a generation, if you're lucky.

20:33.636 --> 20:35.404
I'm just saying, this is our chance

20:35.438 --> 20:38.757
to put a man with integrity
inside that big white house.

20:38.808 --> 20:42.811
So you want to do this
because Fitz is so good? Really?

20:42.845 --> 20:46.114
Doesn't matter why I want to do it.

20:46.449 --> 20:48.016
It matters why you'd want to.

20:50.403 --> 20:51.870
What are we talking about?

20:52.905 --> 20:55.206
(Normal voice) Nothing.

20:55.241 --> 20:57.709
(Normal voice) Pull up a chair, Mellie.

20:57.743 --> 20:59.094
Let's have a discussion.

21:09.447 --> 21:10.814
Fitz is out on his feet.
He's weak,

21:10.849 --> 21:12.516
has trouble concentrating,
plain as day.

21:12.567 --> 21:14.234
Presiding over a national
security crisis...

21:14.269 --> 21:15.652
It's damn near treason.

21:15.703 --> 21:17.988
- He's nixed the air strikes.
- Ooh. He's what?

21:18.422 --> 21:19.739
Do I bring him before congress,

21:19.774 --> 21:21.525
expose his unfitness
to the American people?

21:21.559 --> 21:23.426
No. No.
You do nothing.

21:23.461 --> 21:25.295
Just let him hang himself
with his own lasso.

21:25.329 --> 21:26.763
Mulish pridefulness
about provin' himself

21:26.797 --> 21:28.181
has always been
that boy's Achilles' heel

21:28.216 --> 21:29.633
goin' back to him and his daddy.

21:29.667 --> 21:31.051
All you got to do is lay back, be set,

21:31.085 --> 21:33.620
step in once he crashes and burns.

21:34.438 --> 21:36.072
Your dad is helping.

21:36.123 --> 21:38.207
The numbers are giving you good news.

21:38.241 --> 21:39.792
- Although...
- Although?

21:41.111 --> 21:43.312
You're still 7 points down overall.

21:43.347 --> 21:45.748
(Groans)

21:47.567 --> 21:48.634
Come on!

21:49.169 --> 21:51.436
How was this not fixed earlier?
You!

21:51.454 --> 21:53.021
You have done this before, right?

21:53.056 --> 21:54.957
This is not your first time
plugging in a microphone?

21:54.991 --> 21:57.960
We did hire someone who knows
how to do this job, right?!

21:57.994 --> 22:00.028
Governor.
That's Jason.

22:00.063 --> 22:01.930
And he's almost done fixing
the sound system.

22:01.965 --> 22:03.932
- He just needs a minute.
- This is a town hall forum.

22:03.967 --> 22:05.751
You got people spread
all around the room,

22:05.785 --> 22:07.953
and I cannot hear what they are saying!

22:07.971 --> 22:11.288
What's the point of a debate
prep if I can't debate?

22:11.306 --> 22:13.541
Everyone, good work.
But let's call it a night.

22:13.576 --> 22:14.726
(Sighs) Go home, get some sleep.

22:14.760 --> 22:16.744
We'll start here again
at 7:00 A.M.

22:18.179 --> 22:19.581
Not you.

22:20.716 --> 22:23.334
Those people are working
their butts off for you.

22:23.368 --> 22:25.302
- Then we need better people.
- Or we need a better candidate.

22:25.320 --> 22:26.437
Screw you.

22:26.471 --> 22:28.322
I am getting killed in these debates.

22:28.373 --> 22:30.608
I lose votes in these debates.
I need to be prepared.

22:30.642 --> 22:32.794
Which is what we were doing when
you started yelling at people.

22:32.845 --> 22:34.378
I am yelling because no
one is doing their job.

22:34.413 --> 22:36.531
- Your job is to make sure I win.
- Good.

22:37.465 --> 22:40.667
I was worried you thought
my job is to get felt up

22:40.701 --> 22:42.218
in elevators by my drunken candidate.

22:42.253 --> 22:43.703
I'm sorry about that.
You know I'm sorry about that.

22:43.738 --> 22:45.572
- Do you even want this?
- What?

22:45.623 --> 22:47.290
Do you even want to be President?

22:47.325 --> 22:48.692
Obviously.

22:48.726 --> 22:50.660
Is it obvious?
I'm running.

22:50.678 --> 22:52.529
You're running like
you're being chased.

22:52.563 --> 22:54.264
You're not running like you want
to cross the finish line first,

22:54.399 --> 22:56.933
and so I'm asking you, do you want it?

22:56.967 --> 22:59.786
Or are you just wasting everyone's time

22:59.820 --> 23:03.406
and money and energy and
faith and hopes and dreams?!

23:03.441 --> 23:04.808
- I want it.
- Why?

23:04.842 --> 23:06.176
- Liv. - Why do you want
to be the President?

23:06.210 --> 23:07.344
Okay, Olivia.
Why?!

23:07.378 --> 23:08.928
I don't know what you want me to say!

23:08.963 --> 23:11.681
That's your problem.
You're always trying to say

23:11.716 --> 23:12.949
what you think everyone wants to hear,

23:12.983 --> 23:14.584
be what you think everyone
wants you to be,

23:14.602 --> 23:15.885
and I should have caught it before.

23:15.919 --> 23:18.788
I would have if we weren't...
(Sighs)

23:20.825 --> 23:23.426
I know you...

23:24.361 --> 23:26.161
Because you let me know you.

23:26.196 --> 23:28.631
But America has no idea who you are,

23:28.665 --> 23:31.800
because you've never let them
know who you are.

23:31.835 --> 23:33.302
Nobody can tell you how to do that.

23:33.336 --> 23:35.604
I can't fix that, because
I'm not running for President.

23:35.638 --> 23:37.439
Neither is Cyrus,
neither is your father,

23:37.457 --> 23:38.757
so who are <i>you,</i>

23:38.792 --> 23:42.494
and why do <i>you</i> want to be President?

23:42.529 --> 23:44.680
Mellie came to me.
I tried to stop it, but...

23:44.714 --> 23:46.682
(Sighs) He's Fitz.

23:46.716 --> 23:49.051
He'll look okay on tv, but...

23:49.069 --> 23:51.320
- What? - The man is supposed
to be in the hospital,

23:51.354 --> 23:54.189
and instead he's been working all day.

23:55.659 --> 23:57.176
(Lowered voice) I don't think
he'll last on his feet

23:57.210 --> 23:59.578
more than 30 seconds.
You have to shut this down.

23:59.612 --> 24:04.917
(Indistinct conversations)

24:04.951 --> 24:06.819
(Door closes)

24:07.870 --> 24:09.921
I hear someone is being stubborn.

24:09.955 --> 24:11.439
Cyrus sent you.

24:11.457 --> 24:13.358
It might not be wise to
answer questions on live tv

24:13.392 --> 24:14.976
in your condition.

24:15.010 --> 24:17.045
It might not be wise,
but that's what I'm gonna do.

24:17.079 --> 24:19.764
Mind telling me why?

24:19.798 --> 24:22.033
What you said.

24:22.067 --> 24:23.651
I'm stubborn.

24:28.273 --> 24:29.974
(Exhales)

24:31.510 --> 24:33.811
(Exhales and chuckles)

24:35.464 --> 24:36.748
(Exhales)

24:38.966 --> 24:40.884
- You almost died.
- Yes.

24:40.918 --> 24:43.019
- Don't do it again.
- Okay.

24:48.426 --> 24:50.227
(Kisses)

24:50.261 --> 24:52.379
(Sighs)

24:52.413 --> 24:54.080
You can't do this press conference.

24:54.114 --> 24:56.733
You're not strong enough...
Not yet.

24:56.767 --> 24:58.985
I'm doing the press conference.

24:59.020 --> 25:02.405
Tell me why. Tell me why
it's so important to you.

25:02.457 --> 25:03.857
(Groans softly)

25:06.344 --> 25:09.312
This is <i>my</i> office.

25:09.347 --> 25:11.214
I'm the President.

25:12.149 --> 25:14.100
They can shoot me if they want to,

25:14.134 --> 25:15.868
but I'm not going anywhere,
because the people

25:15.902 --> 25:17.386
of this country elected
me to this office,

25:17.421 --> 25:20.256
and the people deserve to see me
and to know that I'm in charge.

25:20.290 --> 25:22.324
(Knock on door)

25:22.359 --> 25:26.929
(Door opens and closes)

25:28.098 --> 25:29.265
Well?

25:29.299 --> 25:32.084
He's doing the press conference...

25:32.102 --> 25:33.469
Live.

25:33.520 --> 25:36.372
And he's going to take questions.

25:36.406 --> 25:38.424
And it's gonna be great.

25:38.442 --> 25:40.826
And it's gonna be great.

25:40.860 --> 25:42.261
(Exhales)

25:48.247 --> 25:50.964
Reston's narrative is that
he was an angry young man

25:51.015 --> 25:53.333
until meeting his wife Joan,
who turned him into

25:53.368 --> 25:55.268
the upstanding
public servant he is today.

25:55.302 --> 25:58.038
Turns out it wasn't love
that fixed him.

25:58.089 --> 25:59.956
- It was Prozac.
- Hmm.

25:59.990 --> 26:01.457
(Projector and camera shutter clicks)

26:01.491 --> 26:03.209
- But this isn't Reston's.
- We pulled it from his trash.

26:03.243 --> 26:05.328
His doctors hide it
under a bunch of fake names,

26:05.362 --> 26:07.329
but they all lead back
to Samuel Montrose Reston.

26:07.347 --> 26:09.398
Fluoxetine.
60 milligrams a day.

26:09.432 --> 26:11.784
For the past 20 years.
That's a pretty heavy habit.

26:11.835 --> 26:14.437
My suggestion, if we choose
to go forward with this,

26:14.471 --> 26:16.455
is to leak rumors
of prescription drug abuse

26:16.507 --> 26:17.907
to the press before the final debate.

26:17.941 --> 26:19.492
It will take over the news cycle

26:19.526 --> 26:21.410
and prevent Reston from
being able to prepare properly.

26:22.145 --> 26:23.545
That's a fine suggestion, honey,

26:23.580 --> 26:25.547
but that's not what we're gonna do.

26:25.582 --> 26:28.133
We're gonna sit on it
until the debate itself.

26:28.167 --> 26:30.085
And then you're gonna work it
into one of your answers

26:30.119 --> 26:32.754
and blindside Reston
and send him up a creek

26:32.788 --> 26:35.641
without a paddle
and demolish him in the process.

26:35.675 --> 26:38.176
(Olivia) - Ahh.
(Jerry chuckles) - Huh?

26:38.928 --> 26:40.895
If you need a rest or don't
know the answer to a question,

26:40.930 --> 26:43.181
take a sip of water.
This is a press conference.

26:43.215 --> 26:44.916
This is a town hall-style debate...

26:44.950 --> 26:46.284
Real Americans with real questions

26:46.318 --> 26:47.952
looking to you for real answers.
Put them...

26:48.003 --> 26:50.655
at ease. This isn't about
military strategy.

26:50.706 --> 26:51.906
It's about convincing
the American people

26:51.941 --> 26:54.258
that their commander-in-chief
is not just back,

26:54.293 --> 26:56.293
but up to the job.

26:56.328 --> 26:58.028
So I wait for a question
about the military?

26:58.062 --> 26:59.546
That's when you drop the bomb.

26:59.581 --> 27:00.948
Give them a choice between a candidate

27:00.982 --> 27:02.349
who's flown combat missions

27:02.383 --> 27:03.884
and a candidate who takes
antidepressants.

27:03.902 --> 27:06.870
Got it?
Got it?

27:06.905 --> 27:07.988
Fitz?

27:08.006 --> 27:09.239
I got it.

27:09.274 --> 27:10.774
Good.

27:11.843 --> 27:14.710
Now show them who you are.

27:15.129 --> 27:17.965
(Indistinct conversations)

27:20.969 --> 27:23.904
(Applause)

27:31.396 --> 27:33.030
(Camera shutters clicking)

27:33.064 --> 27:36.116
At 5:00 this evening
eastern standard time,

27:36.150 --> 27:40.270
a U.S. Navy S.E.A.L.team
parachuted into east Sudan

27:40.305 --> 27:44.640
and captured its President,
Nijam Kinyazi.

27:44.874 --> 27:46.325
(Reston)
The Governor's posturing, Carl.

27:46.359 --> 27:47.659
He wants you to believe
that he's trustworthy,

27:47.694 --> 27:49.011
that he's his father.

27:49.045 --> 27:51.113
He's not his father.
His father was a self-made man.

27:51.147 --> 27:52.798
The Governor...
he was made

27:52.832 --> 27:54.633
on a boarding school assembly line.

27:54.667 --> 27:56.218
He can't relate to you.
(Camera shutter clicks)

27:56.252 --> 27:57.903
(Reporters shouting questions)
(Under breath) Here we go.

27:57.921 --> 27:59.605
- Yes, Carol?
- What were the casualties?

27:59.639 --> 28:02.657
- None on our side.
- And theirs?

28:02.691 --> 28:03.592
I don't have numbers for you yet,

28:03.626 --> 28:05.444
but I'm told there were
several, all non-civilian.

28:06.778 --> 28:08.179
(Reporters shouting questions)
Yeah. Peter?

28:08.213 --> 28:11.014
Having just survived
an assassination attempt,

28:11.032 --> 28:12.750
is there any concern
about P.T.S.D.

28:12.784 --> 28:16.437
or impaired brain functioning that
<i>could</i> affect your judgment?

28:16.471 --> 28:21.542
(Shutters clicking)

28:21.576 --> 28:23.978
(Reporters murmuring)

28:24.012 --> 28:25.980
Oh, boy.

28:27.849 --> 28:29.533
(Clicking continues)

28:30.584 --> 28:33.436
(Moderator) The next question
is for Governor Grant,

28:33.454 --> 28:35.504
and it's from Jessica Moran.

28:35.523 --> 28:37.240
- Jessica.
- Governor Grant...

28:37.274 --> 28:38.291
Hi, Jessica.

28:38.325 --> 28:40.210
As the mother
of an 18-year-old boy

28:40.244 --> 28:43.079
who's about to enlist in the army,

28:43.113 --> 28:46.249
why should I trust you
as our next commander-in-chief?

28:46.283 --> 28:47.784
(Under breath) This is it.

28:47.818 --> 28:49.702
You know, people talk
about a lack of patriotism

28:49.753 --> 28:51.221
in our country.

28:52.255 --> 28:53.856
They're wrong.

28:53.890 --> 28:56.308
And your son is proof of that.

28:56.342 --> 28:59.244
Now, as for whether you should trust me

28:59.279 --> 29:00.963
as commander-in-chief...

29:00.997 --> 29:02.297
Say it.

29:02.331 --> 29:04.666
(Chuckles)

29:04.701 --> 29:06.668
What I should say

29:06.686 --> 29:09.121
is that I've served in the military,

29:09.155 --> 29:11.806
and I've flown combat missions,

29:11.824 --> 29:13.659
and the courage that I exhibited

29:13.693 --> 29:15.677
makes me fit to lead this country.

29:15.712 --> 29:17.763
That's what I should say,

29:17.797 --> 29:20.649
because my pollsters
and aides and advisors

29:20.683 --> 29:22.334
tell me that's what you want to hear.

29:22.368 --> 29:23.752
What the hell's he doing?

29:23.786 --> 29:25.737
But the truth is, Jessica...

29:25.772 --> 29:28.924
Those years I spent in the Navy...

29:28.958 --> 29:30.909
It wasn't courage I felt.

29:31.744 --> 29:34.062
It was fear.

29:34.096 --> 29:35.880
Fear that I'd crash.

29:35.914 --> 29:39.317
Fear that the life
that I wanted to live

29:39.368 --> 29:43.337
would end in a ball of flames
a million Miles from home.

29:43.372 --> 29:47.175
It literally made me sick.

29:47.209 --> 29:50.745
Now does that mean that I am not fit

29:50.779 --> 29:53.715
to be commander-in-chief?

29:53.949 --> 29:55.383
(Camera shutter clicks)

29:55.417 --> 29:56.584
(Projector clicks)

29:56.618 --> 29:59.504
(Camera shutters clicking)

30:00.938 --> 30:02.105
No.

30:03.958 --> 30:05.758
In fact, I've never felt more ready.

30:05.793 --> 30:07.594
Weakness is our strength.

30:07.628 --> 30:08.878
(Camera shutters clicking)

30:08.913 --> 30:11.664
It's what makes us human.

30:11.999 --> 30:14.867
- It's where our compassion
comes from. - I don't believe this.

30:14.902 --> 30:16.402
Our humility.

30:16.437 --> 30:19.705
All qualities that make for
a great commander-in-chief.

30:19.740 --> 30:22.809
You can't have someone protect you

30:22.843 --> 30:25.210
if they don't know
what you're afraid of.

30:25.244 --> 30:27.646
I know what you're afraid of.

30:27.664 --> 30:29.982
I know what your son's afraid of.

30:30.017 --> 30:31.901
Why?

30:31.935 --> 30:33.986
Because I'm afraid of it, too.

30:34.021 --> 30:35.721
(Applause)

30:35.756 --> 30:36.973
(Jessica) Thank you.

30:39.424 --> 30:40.659
Works for me.

30:40.693 --> 30:43.328
- Grant the protector.
- Yeah.

30:43.363 --> 30:46.164
Pull the file on Reston's stint
as Baltimore D.A.

30:46.182 --> 30:48.283
- We're painting him as soft on crime.
- Yeah.

30:48.334 --> 30:50.736
(Applause, camera shutters clicking)

30:50.754 --> 30:52.938
(Fitz) Good night.

30:58.894 --> 31:01.011
You knocked it out of the park, sir.

31:01.045 --> 31:02.680
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

31:02.714 --> 31:04.665
(Laughs)

31:04.699 --> 31:06.934
So that's how you're gonna
win this thing, huh?

31:06.968 --> 31:09.320
By taking out a hankie and crying?

31:09.354 --> 31:12.056
She teed it up for you and you whiffed.

31:12.090 --> 31:13.757
(Scoffs)

31:13.792 --> 31:17.912
I know that I've won
fewer elections than you.

31:17.946 --> 31:19.530
But not because you were
better than me,

31:19.548 --> 31:20.998
because you are not.

31:21.016 --> 31:22.933
You are a petty man.
You are an underhanded man.

31:22.967 --> 31:25.669
You are a small man,
and I don't want to be you,

31:25.704 --> 31:27.938
not now, not ever.

31:28.006 --> 31:29.640
You're gonna lose this election,

31:29.674 --> 31:31.642
and it's gonna be the end of this

31:31.660 --> 31:33.744
so-called career of yours.

31:35.013 --> 31:36.697
You're not cut out to lead.

31:36.748 --> 31:38.649
You never were.

31:38.667 --> 31:42.169
And I may be petty or whatever
else you want to call me,

31:42.204 --> 31:44.488
but I'm a winner.

31:45.974 --> 31:48.676
And that's something you'll never be.

31:53.365 --> 31:54.831
(Chuckles)

31:57.852 --> 31:59.687
(Gate clatters)

32:08.405 --> 32:10.840
Mr. President,
if I could have a word.

32:10.874 --> 32:13.676
You're gonna need to move
this stuff out of here, Sally.

32:13.710 --> 32:16.962
Of course. I'll send someone
right away.

32:18.013 --> 32:19.681
What do you need?

32:19.715 --> 32:21.365
I just wanted to congratulate you

32:21.383 --> 32:22.851
on kinyazi.

32:22.902 --> 32:25.553
I didn't think a S.E.A.L. team
was the way to go. I was wrong.

32:25.604 --> 32:27.372
These things don't always
break your way.

32:27.406 --> 32:29.057
This time it did.

32:29.108 --> 32:30.825
I always wanted to give you this.

32:32.745 --> 32:36.798
It's a copy of my letter
accepting your reinstatement.

32:36.832 --> 32:38.783
When I questioned
your readiness to serve,

32:38.818 --> 32:40.085
I was just thinking about our country,

32:40.519 --> 32:41.602
where it would leave us,

32:41.637 --> 32:43.054
how it would make us look to the world.

32:43.088 --> 32:46.140
I wasn't rooting for you
to fail or die.

32:46.175 --> 32:47.725
The truth is, your getting shot

32:47.759 --> 32:50.411
was the scariest thing
that ever happened to me.

32:50.445 --> 32:53.331
I haven't slept a night
during this whole time.

32:56.318 --> 32:59.537
It is not easy being President.

33:01.773 --> 33:03.590
Thank you, Sally.

33:03.624 --> 33:06.660
You are welcome,
Mr. President.

33:09.263 --> 33:10.947
Got my boy sleeping
with his phone under his pillow.

33:10.982 --> 33:12.883
One call from me, this election's ours.

33:12.917 --> 33:15.652
- No. - We don't use him,
we're gonna lose this thing.

33:15.670 --> 33:17.621
Or maybe you thought that
little math girlie was wrong

33:17.655 --> 33:20.139
about how everything's gonna
shake out in Ohio.

33:20.190 --> 33:23.092
I can't <i>believe</i>
we are having this conversation.

33:23.110 --> 33:24.377
- Olivia, let's be practical.
- Mm.

33:24.411 --> 33:26.045
- What do you want?
- What?

33:26.080 --> 33:28.297
- What do you want out of this?
- I don't know.

33:28.331 --> 33:30.199
Verna here is gonna be
supreme court justice

33:30.233 --> 33:31.566
first time there's a vacancy.

33:31.584 --> 33:33.402
Cyrus is gonna be chief of staff.

33:33.436 --> 33:35.254
Mellie... well, First Lady.

33:37.691 --> 33:39.675
And what are you, Hollis?

33:39.709 --> 33:41.810
I'm a guy everyone
sitting here owes a favor to.

33:41.844 --> 33:46.115
Olivia, you need to think
about your future and decide...

33:46.149 --> 33:47.783
What do you want?

33:51.287 --> 33:53.255
- It has to be unanimous.
- Cyrus...

33:53.289 --> 33:56.492
No, the only way we trust each other
is if everybody's ass is on the line.

33:56.526 --> 33:58.826
If it's not unanimous, we don't do it.

33:58.827 --> 34:00.478
Then we don't do it.

34:01.663 --> 34:04.899
(Sighs)

34:07.469 --> 34:09.303
Governor?

34:09.338 --> 34:10.987
Fitz, you all right?

34:12.458 --> 34:15.810
My father had a heart attack
and died 20 minutes ago.

34:25.353 --> 34:27.505
(Projector and camera shutter clicks)

34:33.362 --> 34:35.496
It was a very nice funeral.

34:39.266 --> 34:41.368
I liked what you said
about your father.

34:41.402 --> 34:43.337
It was a lie.

34:43.371 --> 34:46.072
The story about the dog
he got me for my 10th birthday,

34:46.107 --> 34:48.542
I made it up.

34:48.576 --> 34:50.511
'Cause you can't get up
at your father's funeral

34:50.545 --> 34:53.947
and tell the story about how
you sat outside his office door

34:53.982 --> 34:56.533
on your 10th birthday and...

34:56.568 --> 34:58.452
listened to him bang his secretary.

34:58.486 --> 34:59.486
(Grunts)

34:59.521 --> 35:01.655
(Exhales)

35:03.591 --> 35:04.992
I'm not sad.

35:06.077 --> 35:07.578
I'm relieved.

35:10.582 --> 35:11.648
I'm free.

35:11.683 --> 35:13.951
(Wood clatters) (Grunts)

35:15.203 --> 35:17.871
And I want it, Liv.
(Axe clatters)

35:17.906 --> 35:20.073
I want to win this election.

35:20.808 --> 35:22.809
I'm going to win.

35:24.061 --> 35:26.462
It's mine.

35:28.898 --> 35:31.183
Do you think I'll make
a good President?

35:33.503 --> 35:36.939
I think you'll make a <i>great</i> President.

35:59.012 --> 36:00.913
Put down the axe.

36:00.947 --> 36:02.381
Put it down!

36:02.415 --> 36:03.465
(Wood clatters)

36:06.920 --> 36:08.737
Come here.

36:33.913 --> 36:36.715
(Stifled crying)

36:36.749 --> 36:38.600
(Sobs)

36:38.635 --> 36:42.154
(Sobbing)

36:42.172 --> 36:46.358
(Continues sobbing)

36:54.882 --> 36:56.449
I'm changing my locks.

36:56.483 --> 36:57.567
I wanted to talk to you,

36:57.601 --> 36:58.701
and I didn't want to wait in the hall.

36:58.735 --> 37:00.369
We're done talking.
(Keys clatter)

37:00.403 --> 37:03.022
I've been thinking about this.
Everything.

37:03.056 --> 37:04.407
And you were right.

37:04.441 --> 37:06.109
It was sexist to suggest

37:06.143 --> 37:07.744
that you were in a relationship
with the President.

37:07.778 --> 37:10.363
I was to wrong to think
that there was a conspiracy,

37:10.397 --> 37:13.032
that someone forged
the President's signature.

37:13.066 --> 37:16.152
I'm sorry.

37:16.186 --> 37:17.587
I was wrong.

37:17.621 --> 37:21.958
You forget that I know <i>you</i> too well.

37:21.992 --> 37:27.547
And so I know
when you are lying, Edison.

37:31.285 --> 37:33.519
I love you.

37:34.354 --> 37:36.355
I am <i>in</i> love with you,

37:36.406 --> 37:38.206
and I don't care what you've done,

37:38.240 --> 37:40.242
who you've loved...
I don't care.

37:40.276 --> 37:42.511
And if you will have me,

37:42.545 --> 37:45.147
I would very much like to marry you.

37:49.201 --> 37:50.985
(Groans) You were incredible today.

37:51.020 --> 37:52.587
I've never seen anything like it.

37:52.621 --> 37:55.323
That press conference was flawless.
(Groans)

37:55.357 --> 37:56.708
Struck just the right tone.

37:56.742 --> 38:00.127
Presidential. Strong.
Everything. Back to normal.

38:00.462 --> 38:02.262
(Sighs) I was worried, I have to admit.

38:02.280 --> 38:04.732
I was very worried.
Something like this happens...

38:04.766 --> 38:06.200
a shooting or an accident...

38:06.234 --> 38:08.802
You remember senator Hutchins.
He was in that car accident.

38:08.837 --> 38:11.355
Now he's quadriplegic,
and his poor wife...

38:11.389 --> 38:13.207
She has to change his diapers.
(Groans softly)

38:13.241 --> 38:14.575
I can't even imagine.

38:14.609 --> 38:16.710
Your life can change in an instant.

38:16.744 --> 38:19.363
<i>We</i> were lucky.

38:19.397 --> 38:21.465
You're back. You're you.

38:21.499 --> 38:23.033
That is...

38:23.068 --> 38:26.370
To have our life go back
to the way it was...

38:26.404 --> 38:28.672
Is a gift.

38:28.707 --> 38:30.624
Everything's good.
I'm grateful.

38:30.659 --> 38:32.710
I'm so grateful.

38:32.744 --> 38:36.080
And... honestly?

38:36.114 --> 38:39.265
Your approval rating
has never been higher.

38:39.300 --> 38:41.434
You can have anything
you want right now.

38:41.452 --> 38:43.186
Anything.
We should think about that.

38:43.220 --> 38:46.439
We should take advantage
of this moment politically.

38:46.473 --> 38:48.675
But we have to be smart about it.

38:48.709 --> 38:51.694
What do you think?
What do you want?

38:53.163 --> 38:56.082
If <i>you</i> could have anything...

39:01.171 --> 39:02.972
I want a divorce.

39:06.109 --> 39:07.409
You're telling me that even though

39:07.443 --> 39:09.161
there are 120 million people
voting in this thing,

39:09.195 --> 39:10.595
all we care about is Ohio?

39:10.630 --> 39:11.963
Our problem isn't Ohio.

39:11.981 --> 39:14.416
Our problem is Franklin,
Summit, and Defiance.

39:14.450 --> 39:16.201
You're right.
Take out those three counties,

39:16.235 --> 39:18.103
and this election
is a statistical dead heat.

39:18.137 --> 39:19.988
It could go either way.

39:20.039 --> 39:21.807
Painting Reston as soft
on crime has been a godsend.

39:21.841 --> 39:23.859
There isn't any crime in Defiance?

39:23.910 --> 39:26.094
I just do the math.
(Papers thud)

39:26.129 --> 39:29.347
(Telephone ringing in distance)

39:29.365 --> 39:31.466
I don't know how you can
even consider...

39:31.501 --> 39:33.819
It isn't my idea. Hollis...

39:33.853 --> 39:35.137
Hollis is your guy.

39:35.171 --> 39:37.456
Hollis is Fitz's guy.

39:37.490 --> 39:40.659
Let's not play innocent here.

39:41.693 --> 39:44.328
Fitz is clean.
Fitz walks on water.

39:44.363 --> 39:46.797
Fitz makes the fishes and the loaves.

39:46.832 --> 39:49.016
And people like Hollis
and me and you...

39:49.067 --> 39:50.217
(Scoffs)

39:50.552 --> 39:53.071
Don't roll your eyes.

39:53.105 --> 39:55.940
You're one of us, Olivia.

39:55.974 --> 39:58.793
We march behind him.

39:59.427 --> 40:01.161
We sing his happy tune.

40:01.196 --> 40:03.030
And then we pick up our hatchets,

40:03.081 --> 40:05.883
and we chop up the judases
into bloody little pieces

40:05.917 --> 40:10.354
and dance around their corpses,
because that is our job.

40:10.388 --> 40:14.575
That is what we do.
We take care of Fitz.

40:14.609 --> 40:17.210
And we don't do it
because we are believers,

40:17.261 --> 40:18.796
which we are.

40:19.630 --> 40:21.831
We don't do it for the rush
or the high or the power,

40:21.866 --> 40:23.650
which we are most
certainly junkies for.

40:23.701 --> 40:27.320
We do it because Fitz can't.
He can't do it.

40:27.355 --> 40:30.724
If he could do it, we wouldn't
worship at his altar.

40:30.758 --> 40:35.145
People like Fitz...
They go down in history.

40:35.179 --> 40:39.949
People like us, we create the history.
(Breath quavering)

40:40.767 --> 40:43.869
We run this world so he can lead it.

40:43.920 --> 40:47.423
In order to lead it, the people
have to elect him, Cyrus.

40:47.457 --> 40:48.924
The people have to find him worthy.

40:48.958 --> 40:50.793
That's what I'm trying to tell you.

40:50.827 --> 40:53.479
The way this world works,

40:53.513 --> 40:55.765
the people is you and me

40:55.799 --> 40:57.867
and Hollis and Mellie and Verna.
(Breathing heavily)

40:57.901 --> 40:59.718
- We're the people.
- Cy...

40:59.770 --> 41:01.837
No. It comes down
to two questions, Olivia...

41:01.872 --> 41:04.573
does he deserve to be President?

41:04.608 --> 41:06.709
And if you believe he does,

41:06.743 --> 41:08.928
do you think he can win it on his own?

41:08.979 --> 41:12.331
If you can say "yes" to both,

41:12.382 --> 41:15.551
then we'll never discuss
election rigging...

41:15.569 --> 41:17.486
Ever again.

41:26.229 --> 41:28.730
Do you think I'll make
a good President?

41:28.731 --> 41:29.831
He's the real deal.

41:29.832 --> 41:32.233
- Once in a generation.
- You're gonna lose this election.

41:32.267 --> 41:33.651
<i>Do you think I'll make</i>
<i>a good President?</i>

41:33.685 --> 41:34.986
Fitzgerald can't pull this
off on his own.

41:35.037 --> 41:36.254
- I gotta win this election.
- What do you want?

41:36.305 --> 41:37.855
- It's mine.
- <i>Think about your future.</i>

41:37.890 --> 41:39.540
- I'm going to win...
- I'm a winner.

41:39.575 --> 41:41.542
- ...this election.
- That's something you'll never be.

41:41.560 --> 41:42.794
It's mine.

41:47.081 --> 41:48.900
(Cyrus) It's a finite number
of people, Mellie.

41:48.901 --> 41:50.251
- That's all I'm saying.
- Cyrus, we are all working

41:50.268 --> 41:51.368
as hard as we can work.

41:51.369 --> 41:52.536
I know.
I know that.

41:52.570 --> 41:54.020
So we tell them they just...
(Speaks indistinctly)

41:54.038 --> 41:55.505
Yes.

41:55.540 --> 41:57.274
Yes?

41:58.876 --> 42:00.410
So you're...

42:00.445 --> 42:02.329
In.

42:08.336 --> 42:10.870
(Beep)

42:10.888 --> 42:12.689
(Clears throat)

42:15.944 --> 42:17.561
It's a go.
