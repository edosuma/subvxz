01:20.400 --> 01:22.470
It's beeping pretty good now.

01:22.471 --> 01:25.142
We're definitely getting closer
to the alien crystal.

01:25.143 --> 01:27.179
And to the story of the decade...

01:27.180 --> 01:28.716
Crystals from outer space,

01:28.717 --> 01:30.720
real-live aliens from other planets !

01:30.721 --> 01:33.157
And i can't tell a soul about it.

01:33.158 --> 01:36.330
It's only until we find the other
fragments, April.

01:36.331 --> 01:38.836
Leonardo's right. There's too much
at stake here.

01:40.841 --> 01:43.611
Hey, it's indicating for us to turn here.

01:51.695 --> 01:54.800
Well, it looks kinda deserted,
doesn't it ?

01:54.801 --> 01:57.371
No doubt about it.
We're getting closer.

02:01.280 --> 02:02.548
End of the line.

02:02.549 --> 02:03.885
A carnival ?

02:03.886 --> 02:06.623
That crystal is somewhere
on these grounds.

02:06.624 --> 02:09.162
Well, I just hope it's
near the pizza stand.

02:09.163 --> 02:11.700
I'm so hungry I'm hollow.

02:11.701 --> 02:13.102
Wait a minute, fellas.

02:13.103 --> 02:15.307
You can't walk in there looking
like that.

02:15.308 --> 02:18.480
Why not ? Is there
a carnival dress code ?

02:18.481 --> 02:20.483
You're turtles, remember ?

02:20.484 --> 02:22.922
So that's why i'm green.

02:22.923 --> 02:24.892
And i always thought
it was something i ate.

02:24.893 --> 02:26.328
It's cool, April.

02:26.329 --> 02:28.599
We'll just tell 'em
we're with the sideshow.

02:35.046 --> 02:40.623
Unfortunately I had to call you back
here to Dimension X.

02:40.624 --> 02:42.494
Obviously, it's vital.

02:42.495 --> 02:44.965
Now, let me see the crystal.

02:44.966 --> 02:48.405
I--i--i'm afraid it was lost, Krang.

02:48.406 --> 02:53.248
Lost ?! How could
such a thing happen ?

02:53.249 --> 02:57.189
My idiot assistant Baxter
accidentally threw it out.

02:57.190 --> 02:59.994
It's possible
I merely misplaced it.

03:01.164 --> 03:03.835
Don't eat near the equipment,
you micro-brain !

03:03.836 --> 03:05.772
Yes, master.
I'm sorry.

03:05.773 --> 03:08.510
You must help me find it, Krang.

03:08.511 --> 03:11.249
I'll never be able
to defeat the turtles

03:11.250 --> 03:12.552
without all the fragments.

03:12.553 --> 03:15.992
A-a-all right, Shredder.

03:15.993 --> 03:18.564
But let this be the last time.

03:18.565 --> 03:23.039
I'm a ruthless Intergalactic
Evildoer,

03:23.040 --> 03:25.009
not a wet nurse.

03:26.313 --> 03:33.259
I've located it in an area outside
the city.

03:35.664 --> 03:37.067
I know where this is...

03:37.068 --> 03:39.371
On the grounds of a small carnival.

03:39.372 --> 03:44.114
Splendid. Then that
is where you shall go.

03:44.115 --> 03:45.383
To a carnival ?

03:45.384 --> 03:48.188
Yes, you'll fit in quite well

03:48.189 --> 03:52.129
with the other freaks.

03:54.636 --> 03:56.304
We can't be far now.

03:56.305 --> 03:58.642
Yeah, we hang a left
at the bearded lady

03:58.643 --> 04:00.045
and go past the flea circus.

04:00.046 --> 04:04.620
I got news for ya.
We already did pass the flea circus.

04:04.621 --> 04:07.793
Hey, mom, look at
that bunch of weird people.

04:07.794 --> 04:09.163
You see what happens if you

04:09.164 --> 04:10.599
don't eat all your vegetables, dear ?

04:10.600 --> 04:12.503
You turn green like them.

04:12.504 --> 04:14.407
Quick, pass the spinach.

04:14.408 --> 04:17.478
Ok, turtles, it's very close now.

04:17.478 --> 04:19.983
Hold everything.
Where's Michelangelo ?

04:21.856 --> 04:25.027
All right, here i go again.

04:25.028 --> 04:27.131
Cowabunga !

04:30.272 --> 04:33.277
Like, I'm batting a thousand !

04:33.278 --> 04:37.385
Michelangelo, i've been looking 
all over the carnival for you !

04:37.386 --> 04:41.359
Why'd you do that ?
I was right here.

04:41.360 --> 04:44.431
Here, i won these for you.

04:44.432 --> 04:46.769
You really shouldn't have done it.

04:52.115 --> 04:55.353
That was fun !
Want to go again ?

04:55.354 --> 04:58.559
I can't. I'm all out of tickets.

04:58.560 --> 05:00.864
Hey, look !

05:02.835 --> 05:07.276
You think
It's a diamond ?

05:07.277 --> 05:11.751
If it is, we can trade it
for lots more rides.

05:11.752 --> 05:14.691
All right, we're zeroing in on it.

05:17.130 --> 05:20.134
What, those 2 kids have the crystal ?

05:20.135 --> 05:23.107
Alien tracking devices never lie.

05:23.108 --> 05:25.946
What are we supposed to do, 
knock 'em out and grab it ?

05:25.947 --> 05:28.084
I'll take the little one.

05:28.085 --> 05:30.823
Oh, wait a minute.
They're both little.

05:30.824 --> 05:35.131
Never mind, fellas.
I'll talk to them.

05:35.132 --> 05:37.569
Where the heck have you 
bozos been ?

05:37.570 --> 05:39.773
The show started
10 minutes ago.

05:39.774 --> 05:41.677
You're the next act.

05:42.980 --> 05:45.852
And why aren't you
in your clown outfits ?

05:45.853 --> 05:49.191
Excuse me, but i think
you're making a mistake.

05:49.192 --> 05:52.097
I made my mistake
when I hired you geeks.

05:52.098 --> 05:55.237
Now get in there and be funny.

05:55.238 --> 05:59.478
And next time, leave those
corny turtle suits home.

05:59.479 --> 06:01.816
What do you say
we lay this guy out ?

06:01.817 --> 06:04.622
Come on, Raphael.
We don't want to make a scene.

06:04.623 --> 06:06.793
But $3.00 is all i've got.

06:06.794 --> 06:08.763
Would you please sell me
that thing ?

06:08.764 --> 06:12.738
$3.00 ! That won't
buy diddly nowadays.

06:12.739 --> 06:15.309
Yeah, we're children of the eighties,
remember ?

06:15.310 --> 06:17.981
How about a credit card ?

06:17.982 --> 06:21.154
Forget it.
We don't take plastic.

06:21.155 --> 06:24.227
Don't go away.
I'll be right back.

06:24.228 --> 06:26.965
Oh, maybe we should
have taken the $3.00.

06:26.966 --> 06:30.506
Man, you'll never get anywhere
with that attitude.

06:30.507 --> 06:32.677
There it is...
The crystal.

06:32.678 --> 06:34.179
That little brat has it.

06:34.180 --> 06:39.858
Baxter, this will be
like taking candy from a baby. 

06:39.859 --> 06:43.598
You certainly have a way
with words, master.

06:59.062 --> 07:01.566
I don't know why we're doing this.

07:01.567 --> 07:03.637
I feel like such a doofus.

07:03.638 --> 07:06.042
I do, too, but it's all part

07:06.043 --> 07:07.411
of tracking down that fragment.

07:20.304 --> 07:22.875
Who...

07:23.945 --> 07:25.981
Michelangelo, what happened ?

07:25.982 --> 07:29.120
Aw, i never thought being a 
circus star

07:29.121 --> 07:31.158
could make you see stars.

07:31.159 --> 07:33.829
Quick, give me all the money 
you have.

07:33.830 --> 07:36.235
Like, what is this, a holdup ?

07:36.236 --> 07:39.006
I've got to get those kids to sell me
that fragment.

07:39.007 --> 07:41.244
What a bummer.

07:41.245 --> 07:43.849
I left my wallet in my other shell.

07:43.850 --> 07:46.254
Michelangelo !

07:46.255 --> 07:49.126
Well, hey, it was worth a try.

07:50.196 --> 07:51.999
Here they come now, Master.

07:52.000 --> 07:54.870
I wonder where that lady
with the $3.00 went.

07:54.871 --> 07:58.811
Yeah. This thing's
starting to get heavy.

07:58.812 --> 08:01.717
I'll be happy
to take it off your hands.

08:01.718 --> 08:04.556
Where'd you come from ?

08:04.557 --> 08:07.596
If you must know, from Dimension X

08:07.597 --> 08:09.733
In a far-off galaxy.

08:09.734 --> 08:12.338
You don't scare us, Mister.

08:12.339 --> 08:14.777
We see every episode
of Star Trek.

08:14.778 --> 08:17.848
That's right. Now give that
thing back.

08:19.420 --> 08:21.990
Oh, no ! The crystal !

08:21.991 --> 08:24.329
Have no fear, master.
I've got it.

08:24.330 --> 08:25.831
Good catch, Baxter.

08:25.832 --> 08:28.135
You must admit,
I do have soft hands.

08:28.136 --> 08:30.006
Yes, and a head to match.

08:30.007 --> 08:33.511
You big nerd !

08:33.513 --> 08:37.687
Now to discover the secret 
of the crystal

08:37.688 --> 08:40.460
and what special power it has.

08:40.461 --> 08:43.099
Quite fascinating.

08:48.877 --> 08:51.715
A most unusual molecular 
infrastructure.

08:59.331 --> 09:01.534
Clumsy fool !

09:01.535 --> 09:03.271
You could have damaged it.

09:03.272 --> 09:04.840
You also ruined my shine.

09:04.841 --> 09:07.746
It seems to have picked up
some mud from your boot.

09:10.987 --> 09:13.992
That glob, it's starting
to grow.

09:13.993 --> 09:17.165
This is what I wiped from the crystal.

09:19.403 --> 09:21.941
It's some kind
of sporelike substance,

09:21.942 --> 09:23.845
a primitive form of plant life.

09:23.846 --> 09:27.618
It must have stuck to my boot when I
was in Dimension X.

09:27.619 --> 09:30.891
Touching the crystal must have 
triggered its growth process.

09:30.892 --> 09:32.528
A mutant plant,

09:32.529 --> 09:36.068
the perfect way to flush out
those mutant turtles.

09:36.069 --> 09:41.111
Soon the power of the eye of Zarnov
will be mine !

09:58.981 --> 10:02.687
And we came so close to getting
that fragment, too.

10:02.688 --> 10:05.459
Yeah. What a bummer.

10:05.460 --> 10:07.196
You came close once.

10:07.197 --> 10:09.968
The better to prepare you
for your next encounter.

10:09.969 --> 10:12.439
Tell that to this tracking device.

10:12.440 --> 10:15.279
I think it's suffering
from battery burnout.

10:15.280 --> 10:16.748
Hey, no biggie.

10:16.749 --> 10:18.618
I'll just boogie on down
to the store

10:18.619 --> 10:20.556
And pick up some fresh ones.

10:20.557 --> 10:22.660
Except for one small problem ?

10:22.661 --> 10:24.397
This gizmo's from another planet,

10:24.398 --> 10:28.070
And what store Carries battery size,
quadruple "z" ?

10:28.071 --> 10:30.408
What do you advise, Master ?

10:30.409 --> 10:33.347
I have a feeling the answer will
soon come to us.

10:40.028 --> 10:41.830
What's going on ?!

10:44.937 --> 10:47.709
I saw this on the late show once.

10:47.710 --> 10:52.451
The invasion of the mean, green,
giant killer beanstalk.

10:52.452 --> 10:54.455
Didn't think
I could say it, did ya ?

10:54.456 --> 10:56.058
Stand back, April.

10:56.059 --> 10:57.795
This is no mother's day plant.

11:01.336 --> 11:03.072
Chill out, bro !

11:03.073 --> 11:05.477
I'm green, same as you !

11:05.478 --> 11:07.046
Except for your face.

11:07.047 --> 11:08.650
That's turning blue.

11:08.651 --> 11:11.054
Stand back, fellas.
This one's on me.

11:13.927 --> 11:17.066
Let's see how tough
this thing really is.

11:20.440 --> 11:23.111
It's got me !

11:23.112 --> 11:24.447
Back off, buster !

11:24.448 --> 11:26.351
She's not plant food !

11:26.352 --> 11:28.622
Down, boy !

11:32.531 --> 11:36.136
What kind of hideous plant
was that ?

11:36.137 --> 11:37.907
I don't know, man,

11:37.908 --> 11:40.679
But it was mondo bizarro.

11:40.680 --> 11:43.384
My guess is, it's not from
this planet.

11:43.385 --> 11:46.223
I could almost hear it say ouch.

11:46.224 --> 11:48.227
I think that was me.

11:48.228 --> 11:49.596
Well, whatever it was,

11:49.597 --> 11:51.567
we seemed to have
frightened it off.

11:51.568 --> 11:53.871
I have a feeling we have not seen

11:53.872 --> 11:55.608
the last of that plant creature.

11:55.609 --> 11:57.912
Do you think it's somehow 
connected to the Shredder ?

11:57.913 --> 11:59.816
It is highly possible.

11:59.817 --> 12:01.887
He has access to Dimension X,

12:01.888 --> 12:04.693
where many strange organisms
abound.

12:04.694 --> 12:08.399
Speaking of Shredder, we'd better 
start searching for those crystals.

12:08.400 --> 12:10.137
Great. Let's get started.

12:10.138 --> 12:12.741
No, April. We'll drop you off
at your apartment.

12:12.742 --> 12:14.812
We need you to stay
on the turtle com.

12:14.813 --> 12:17.016
I'd rather go along.

12:17.017 --> 12:19.588
You turtles have all the fun.

12:20.858 --> 12:23.763
Blast ! That plant
is moving too slowly.

12:23.764 --> 12:26.334
It will take weeks to
flush out those turtles !

12:26.335 --> 12:28.272
It appears we'll have to
come up

12:28.273 --> 12:30.342
with a different plan
to destroy them.

12:30.343 --> 12:31.946
Brilliant deduction, Baxter.

12:31.947 --> 12:34.751
I sometimes wonder how that little 
pinhead of yours

12:34.752 --> 12:38.024
manages to hold
all those great big brains.

12:38.025 --> 12:39.127
Really, master,

12:39.128 --> 12:40.696
you don't have to be cruel.

12:40.697 --> 12:43.969
Luckily, i've come up
with the perfect plan

12:43.970 --> 12:46.173
to lure the turtles
to their demise.

12:50.884 --> 12:54.156
So, how come you're sitting home
all by your lonesome ?

12:54.157 --> 12:56.594
You couldn't
get a date, either, huh ?

12:56.595 --> 12:58.130
No, Irma. I'm staying home

12:58.131 --> 13:00.000
Because i'm expecting
someone to call.

13:00.001 --> 13:03.006
Sure you are.

13:03.007 --> 13:05.511
So, what's new at channel 6 ?

13:05.512 --> 13:07.382
Oh, well, Vern said,

13:07.383 --> 13:10.855
"if you don't have a story
on the air in 24 hours,

13:10.856 --> 13:12.191
you can look for another job."

13:12.192 --> 13:15.297
Gee, Irma, I'm sure glad i asked.

13:16.935 --> 13:18.503
Who could that be ?

13:18.504 --> 13:21.542
Maybe it's a gentleman caller.

13:21.543 --> 13:24.515
I seriously doubt it.
I don't know any gentlemen.

13:29.393 --> 13:31.963
"Come quick.
We need your help.

13:31.964 --> 13:34.067
Signed, the turtles."

13:34.068 --> 13:35.604
And there's an address !

13:35.605 --> 13:39.377
You're always talking about
those crazy turtles.

13:39.378 --> 13:42.684
Are you sure you didn't just
dream them up ?

13:42.685 --> 13:45.991
You're right, Irma. They're just 
figments of my imagination.

13:45.992 --> 13:47.393
Bye !

13:51.869 --> 13:53.505
This is the address on the note.

13:56.378 --> 13:57.480
Are you here ?

13:58.650 --> 14:00.653
No, but i am !

14:00.654 --> 14:01.888
Shredder !

14:01.889 --> 14:04.326
Baxter, where are your manners ?

14:04.327 --> 14:06.163
Offer the young lady a seat.

14:06.164 --> 14:08.067
Gladly, master.

14:08.068 --> 14:10.538
Make yourself comfortable,
Ms. O'Neill.

14:10.539 --> 14:13.378
You may be here a very long time.

14:17.653 --> 14:18.988
What are you doing ?

14:18.989 --> 14:21.226
Making sure you don't get lonely.

14:26.337 --> 14:27.738
The turtle Communicator !

14:27.739 --> 14:29.409
April, is that you ?

14:29.410 --> 14:31.046
Not even close.

14:31.047 --> 14:32.348
It's Shredder.

14:32.349 --> 14:35.019
What do you want, 
you metal-faced misfit ?

14:35.020 --> 14:37.625
Now, now, speak with respect.

14:37.626 --> 14:40.531
I'm holding your friend
April hostage.

14:42.669 --> 14:45.373
That's April, all right.
I recognize her mumbles.

14:45.374 --> 14:48.245
All right, Shredder, where have you
got her ?

14:48.246 --> 14:50.683
423 dock street.

14:50.684 --> 14:52.787
I'll be waiting, mutants.

14:52.788 --> 14:55.927
Ok, turtles, let's haul shell !

15:00.804 --> 15:03.642
This is it. 423 dock street.

15:03.643 --> 15:06.915
But we just can't rush in there
without a plan.

15:06.916 --> 15:10.122
Yeah. That scuzzball probably 
has the place booby-trapped.

15:10.123 --> 15:13.094
I think so much better
on a full stomach.

15:13.095 --> 15:15.232
How 'bout we take
a pizza break, huh ?

15:15.233 --> 15:17.402
A pizza break ?!

15:17.403 --> 15:19.073
Oh, chill out, dudes.

15:19.074 --> 15:21.410
It was only a suggestion.

15:21.411 --> 15:22.779
Michelangelo,

15:22.780 --> 15:26.153
you just gave us the perfect way
to surprise Shredder.

15:26.154 --> 15:27.823
I did ?

15:30.128 --> 15:31.664
Special delivery.

15:31.665 --> 15:33.968
See who that is.

15:36.942 --> 15:40.014
It's 4 green pizza delivery boys.

15:40.015 --> 15:42.552
I don't remember ordering any pizzas,

15:42.553 --> 15:44.021
especially green ones.

15:45.592 --> 15:47.995
Well, you're gettin' 'em,
whether you want 'em or not !

15:49.199 --> 15:51.068
I--i can't see !

15:51.069 --> 15:53.574
Like, that was the plan, dude !

15:53.575 --> 15:55.744
It will take more than a pizza

15:55.745 --> 15:58.049
with extra olives to stop me.

16:00.654 --> 16:02.224
Bothersome mutants !

16:03.760 --> 16:07.100
Who likes their crust extra crispy ?

16:07.101 --> 16:09.070
This bo's for you, Shredder.

16:10.341 --> 16:12.176
Blast you !

16:12.177 --> 16:14.748
Hold real still, April.

16:17.020 --> 16:18.856
I knew you'd come through !

16:18.857 --> 16:22.129
You didn't think we'd let Shredder 
get away with this, did you ?

16:22.130 --> 16:24.200
Speaking of Shredder getting away...

16:24.201 --> 16:26.404
Farewell, amphibians,

16:26.405 --> 16:28.441
till we meet again !

16:28.442 --> 16:30.212
Bummer !
They got away !

16:30.213 --> 16:32.115
Forget those two for now.

16:32.116 --> 16:33.652
We've got a bigger problem,

16:33.653 --> 16:35.422
Like finding those fragments.

16:35.423 --> 16:37.693
W-what was that ?!

16:39.464 --> 16:43.470
Correction. We've got an even bigger
problem than that,

16:43.471 --> 16:45.876
mainly stopping that alien plant

16:45.877 --> 16:48.147
before it destroys the entire city.

16:48.148 --> 16:51.453
Turtles, i'm not so sure we can.

16:56.331 --> 16:58.400
The mayor has
declared a state of emergency

16:58.401 --> 17:00.638
as the monstrous alien vines continue

17:00.639 --> 17:03.577
to choke off the streets of the city.

17:05.816 --> 17:08.185
Man, it's a jungle out there.

17:08.186 --> 17:11.258
Yeah, they ought to rename this
Vine street.

17:11.259 --> 17:14.164
We'll need some
antiplant firing power.

17:14.165 --> 17:15.767
Battle stations, everyone.

17:15.768 --> 17:17.002
Right !

17:18.874 --> 17:21.044
Bull's-eye, Raphael !

17:27.223 --> 17:28.525
Donatello !

17:28.526 --> 17:29.795
The brakes !

17:31.632 --> 17:35.339
Oh, man, that thing's humongous !

17:35.340 --> 17:37.710
I don't believe it.
It's ripping off our bumper !

17:37.711 --> 17:39.080
What for ?

17:39.081 --> 17:41.083
That's what for.
It's actually eating it.

17:41.084 --> 17:43.822
Well, like, they are rich in iron.

17:46.929 --> 17:48.063
Ok, chump,

17:48.064 --> 17:50.435
you just bit off more than you 
can chew.

17:50.436 --> 17:52.505
Turtle power !

18:01.357 --> 18:04.596
Thanks a lot, Raphael.

18:04.597 --> 18:06.467
Any time, old buddy.

18:06.468 --> 18:07.702
Great !

18:07.703 --> 18:08.704
It's retreating.

18:11.644 --> 18:14.181
Not great. It's headed for the sewers.

18:14.182 --> 18:17.488
Invading the sanctity
of our happy home ?!

18:17.489 --> 18:20.760
This time, it's gone too far !

18:20.761 --> 18:22.999
No one knows the sewers
better than Splinter.

18:23.000 --> 18:25.837
Come on, guys.
He'll help us track it down.

18:32.986 --> 18:34.455
At the rate that plant is growing,

18:34.456 --> 18:36.859
By now, it could be
anywhere under the city.

18:36.860 --> 18:39.264
Where should
we start looking, master ?

18:39.265 --> 18:43.205
It is wise to always start
at the root of the problem.

18:43.206 --> 18:45.509
Of course. The root !

18:45.510 --> 18:47.079
Splinter is right !

18:47.080 --> 18:49.951
Yeah, i can resonate with that.

18:49.952 --> 18:52.657
But where do we glom on to it ?

18:52.658 --> 18:56.297
Even the longest journey
starts with a single step.

18:57.568 --> 18:59.704
I think i know what Splinter means.

18:59.705 --> 19:03.644
This trail of green goo could 
only have been made by that plant.

19:03.645 --> 19:05.014
Well, what are we waiting for ?

19:05.015 --> 19:07.519
An engraved invitation ?
Let's go !

19:12.997 --> 19:16.135
The trail leads along this corridor...

19:17.607 --> 19:20.177
and then disappears.

19:20.178 --> 19:24.318
There's something really weird
going down here.

19:28.027 --> 19:29.863
It's got me !

19:31.667 --> 19:33.403
N-no, wait ! Don't !

19:33.404 --> 19:35.474
I--i taste terrible !

19:35.475 --> 19:37.076
You're saying that to something

19:37.077 --> 19:39.014
That was raised on fertilizer ?

19:39.015 --> 19:42.655
Looks like we'll have to call up
our secret weapon.

19:42.656 --> 19:43.690
You mean...

19:43.691 --> 19:45.794
Exactly. 

19:45.795 --> 19:48.465
Oh, flora !

19:50.738 --> 19:52.640
Come on, man !

19:52.641 --> 19:54.411
You mustn't keep a weed waiting.

19:54.412 --> 19:57.150
But i feel like such a twerp.

19:57.151 --> 19:59.587
Besides, I hate first dates.

20:04.598 --> 20:07.135
You big tease !

20:07.136 --> 20:09.774
I'll bet you do that to all the growths !

20:11.612 --> 20:13.716
Great !
It likes you.

20:13.717 --> 20:14.884
Yeah ! 

20:14.885 --> 20:17.990
You two could make beautiful 
mulch together.

20:17.991 --> 20:20.061
Go ahead, plant one on its lips.

20:20.062 --> 20:23.835
Actually, i'd rather plant one 
on its plant !

20:26.408 --> 20:28.644
Turtle power !

20:28.645 --> 20:31.082
This one's for you, bud !

20:31.083 --> 20:34.422
Just think of us as your friendly
neighborhood weed whackers !

20:37.997 --> 20:40.667
Fellas, remember what Splinter said.

20:40.668 --> 20:43.039
Get at the root of the problem.

20:45.111 --> 20:47.114
Gotcha !

20:48.651 --> 20:52.023
It looks like adios for this vine fellow.

20:55.297 --> 20:56.800
All right !
We did it !

20:56.801 --> 20:58.703
Ninja power,
Yeah !

20:58.704 --> 21:00.941
Way to go, Michelangelo !

21:00.942 --> 21:03.779
Watch it, bud.
You're crushing my leaves.

21:03.780 --> 21:07.353
I may wanna wear this at the next
harvest moon ball.

21:10.961 --> 21:12.997
This is some dynamite pizza.

21:12.998 --> 21:14.701
What's on it, Michelangelo ?

21:14.702 --> 21:18.074
Everything except green veggies.

21:18.075 --> 21:22.316
Good idea, after that experience
with the giant plant.

21:22.317 --> 21:25.088
I hope you fellas don't feel that way
about all plants.

21:25.089 --> 21:26.959
What's that for, April ?

21:26.960 --> 21:29.363
Well, every sewer can use
a little cheering up.

21:29.364 --> 21:31.667
Well, it is sort of pretty.

21:31.668 --> 21:33.605
What kind of plant is it ?

21:34.608 --> 21:37.779
A venus's-flytrap.

21:37.780 --> 21:40.117
Now she tells me.

21:41.305 --> 21:47.741
