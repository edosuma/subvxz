WEBVTT

00:01.225 --> 00:04.361
Okay, Ron. Enough's enough.
Let's talk plans for Diane's baby shower.

00:04.481 --> 00:06.566
- Dear God, woman.
- Three main activities--

00:06.600 --> 00:08.768
baby bingo, baby food tasting,

00:08.802 --> 00:12.021
and my personal favorite--
baby onesie decorating station.

00:12.072 --> 00:13.806
I'm gonna make mine
look like an astronaut.

00:13.824 --> 00:15.141
What are you doing
up there in space, baby?

00:15.159 --> 00:16.659
Ah! So cute!
Okay.

00:16.693 --> 00:19.293
I have some gift ideas.
I was looking at a very adorable stroller.

00:19.347 --> 00:21.181
We already have a stroller.

00:21.215 --> 00:22.399
Oh, shoot. Really?

00:22.433 --> 00:23.817
I'm gonna have to think
of something else.

00:24.852 --> 00:25.935
Oh, my God, whose baby is that?

00:25.987 --> 00:27.437
That would be mine.

00:27.488 --> 00:29.722
Guys, get in here!
Ron has a baby!

00:29.740 --> 00:32.058
- Oh, Ron, cool baby.
- Thank you, Andrew.

00:32.076 --> 00:34.110
Everyone,
I'd like to introduce you

00:34.161 --> 00:37.781
to my son, John middle name
redacted Swanson.

00:37.832 --> 00:40.000
John was born some time ago,

00:40.034 --> 00:42.669
weighing multiple pounds
and several ounces.

00:42.703 --> 00:45.571
Much like his father,
he is a fan of silence.

00:45.589 --> 00:47.073
Please keep your voices down.

00:47.091 --> 00:48.541
How am I supposed
to keep my voice down

00:48.575 --> 00:50.343
when you had your baby,

00:50.378 --> 00:51.961
and you didn't
tell me that you had your baby?

00:52.013 --> 00:53.413
Why would you need to know
something like that?

00:53.431 --> 00:55.465
Why would I--
oh, my God.

00:55.516 --> 00:57.133
I have not even
sent Diane a gift.

00:57.184 --> 00:59.252
She's just walking around,

00:59.270 --> 01:00.887
wondering why I haven't
sent her a gift yet.

01:00.921 --> 01:02.272
Should we do something?

01:02.306 --> 01:03.723
Just let her tire herself out.

01:03.757 --> 01:05.942
If you need anything from us,
Ron, please just let us know.

01:05.976 --> 01:07.427
Actually there is something.

01:07.445 --> 01:09.646
Could one of you please
stop by the pet store

01:09.697 --> 01:11.865
and pick up some fish food
for me?

01:11.899 --> 01:13.650
When did you get a fish?

01:16.687 --> 01:24.711

01:35.519 --> 01:36.820
Okay, youth committee.

01:36.854 --> 01:38.855
Update on the unity concert.
Madison.

01:38.906 --> 01:41.191
So far, 12 bands have said yes.

01:41.242 --> 01:42.642
And we asked them all
to submit a song

01:42.660 --> 01:44.077
for the new
town anthem contest.

01:44.111 --> 01:46.029
I think we should book Orin
as a headliner.

01:46.080 --> 01:47.530
I think it's a no-brainer.

01:47.581 --> 01:50.533
Um, he dislocates his shoulder
to the music of Billy Joel.

01:50.584 --> 01:51.868
The <i>Pawnee Journal</i> called it,

01:51.919 --> 01:53.036
"Why would anyone do this?"

01:53.087 --> 01:54.871
Stop suggesting Orin.

01:54.922 --> 01:56.539
Craig, any update
on the art tents?

01:56.554 --> 01:58.634
14 local artists have
signed up to show their work.

01:58.659 --> 02:00.543
It was going to be 15,
but then this one guy

02:00.594 --> 02:02.378
described himself
as "Jackson Pollock-esque"

02:02.430 --> 02:04.013
and I told him that's
finger painting for adults

02:04.048 --> 02:05.381
and I hate it!

02:05.433 --> 02:08.017
The Pawnee-Eagleton merger
has made for a rough year,

02:08.051 --> 02:09.936
both for me and for the town.

02:09.970 --> 02:11.838
But if I can pull off
this unity concert

02:11.856 --> 02:14.224
and prove that this merger
was a success,

02:14.275 --> 02:18.728
Pawnee might once again
tolerate-slash-ignore me.

02:18.779 --> 02:20.847
I know that sounds bad,
but for a politician

02:20.865 --> 02:23.182
it's pretty much
the best-case scenario.

02:23.200 --> 02:25.151
You guys might as well be
a pile of leaves

02:25.185 --> 02:26.719
because you're about
to get blown away.

02:26.754 --> 02:30.957
I have booked a meeting with
none other than Grant Larson.

02:32.192 --> 02:34.694
- No one knows who that is?
- Um, I do.

02:34.712 --> 02:36.463
"Grant Larson,"
otherwise known as Elton John.

02:36.497 --> 02:37.747
Congratulations, Leslie.

02:37.798 --> 02:39.332
No, Grant Larson
is the director

02:39.366 --> 02:41.868
of the Midwest branch
of the National Park Service.

02:41.886 --> 02:43.703
He's basically
the Liam Bonneville

02:43.721 --> 02:46.055
of the Midwest.

02:46.090 --> 02:47.390
Liam Bonneville?

02:47.424 --> 02:49.175
The department of the interior's
resident bad boy?

02:49.209 --> 02:51.644
He's basically the Tim Dweck--
Okay, never mind.

02:51.679 --> 02:54.097
I have asked Grant
to declare Eagleton Hills

02:54.148 --> 02:55.815
a national park

02:55.850 --> 02:57.767
as the grand finale
of our unity concert.

02:57.818 --> 02:59.235
Great idea, Leslie.

02:59.270 --> 03:00.520
And with that update,

03:00.554 --> 03:02.405
the Pawnee new founder's day
unity concert

03:02.439 --> 03:04.524
is now officially...

03:04.558 --> 03:06.442
ahead of schedule!

03:06.494 --> 03:09.913
And that banner unfurling
marks the 100th time

03:09.947 --> 03:13.500
that one of my projects
has been...

03:13.534 --> 03:15.067
ahead of schedule.

03:15.085 --> 03:17.203
This is your chance
to put your names

03:17.237 --> 03:21.424
on the Pawnee unity concert,
the biggest event of 2014...

03:21.458 --> 03:23.042
besides the unveiling
of Tricia's new highlights.

03:23.076 --> 03:25.628
You think I wouldn't notice?
You look fly as hell, girl!

03:26.931 --> 03:29.148
This unity concert
needs corporate sponsorship,

03:29.183 --> 03:31.134
so Ben and I are meeting
with local bigwigs.

03:31.185 --> 03:33.803
I'm gonna do what I do best--
lock down deals.

03:33.854 --> 03:36.389
And dork-asaurus over here is
gonna handle the boring stuff.

03:36.423 --> 03:40.777
You said you genuinely valued
my business acumen.

03:40.811 --> 03:43.613
Also, I'm your boss.

03:43.647 --> 03:45.231
Oh, my God, he's so cute.

03:45.265 --> 03:47.266
You're the cutest
little boo-bear I've ever seen.

03:47.284 --> 03:48.902
You are the world's
most adorable baby

03:48.936 --> 03:50.486
and I love you!

03:50.538 --> 03:52.605
You are so freaking precious!

03:52.623 --> 03:53.944
Look what Gayle made
for the baby.

03:53.958 --> 03:56.409
It says "Property
of Pawnee government."

03:56.443 --> 03:57.827
Isn't that adorable?

03:59.496 --> 04:01.214
Come on, John.

04:03.283 --> 04:05.001
Jeez.

04:05.052 --> 04:06.169
Here we are...

04:06.220 --> 04:08.621
the park that borders
Pawnee and Eagleton.

04:08.639 --> 04:10.173
This is the perfect place
for the press conference

04:10.224 --> 04:11.591
to announce our unity concert.

04:11.625 --> 04:13.305
People are gonna clap,
they're gonna cheer.

04:13.310 --> 04:15.762
Today might be the day
that I finally crowd surf.

04:15.796 --> 04:18.130
I should probably
empty my pockets just in case.

04:18.148 --> 04:19.682
Hey, one question.

04:19.733 --> 04:21.517
Um, where do you think
you're gonna stand,

04:21.569 --> 04:24.871
in front of the graffiti
that says "Pawnee, you suck,"

04:24.905 --> 04:26.656
or "Go home, Eagleton snobs"?

04:26.690 --> 04:28.274
I painted over that graffiti
a week ago.

04:28.308 --> 04:29.609
These people are the worst!

04:29.643 --> 04:31.494
I cannot announce
a unity concert

04:31.528 --> 04:32.912
in front of a picture
of a bald eagle

04:32.947 --> 04:34.280
giving the middle finger.

04:34.314 --> 04:35.531
Yeah, you probably
wanna stand to the side

04:35.583 --> 04:36.833
so people can see it.

04:36.867 --> 04:38.818
You know, why do we even
have this wall?

04:38.836 --> 04:41.004
We're supposed to be
uniting the two towns,

04:41.038 --> 04:43.990
and this literally
divides them.

04:44.008 --> 04:45.208
We should just knock it down.

04:45.259 --> 04:48.044
On it, boss.

04:48.095 --> 04:49.295
Ahh!

04:49.329 --> 04:50.513
Ow.

04:50.547 --> 04:52.966
The kool-aid guy
makes it look so easy.

04:55.853 --> 04:57.336
In the time I've worked here,

04:57.354 --> 04:58.771
I've taken great pains

04:58.806 --> 05:00.723
to see as little
of this building as possible.

05:00.774 --> 05:04.060
Turns out the third floor
is silent, empty,

05:04.111 --> 05:07.113
and completely free
of government work.

05:07.147 --> 05:09.198
I can't think of anything
more beautiful

05:09.233 --> 05:11.034
to share with my son.

05:12.519 --> 05:13.870
If I had a toolbox

05:13.904 --> 05:16.789
I could take care
of that faulty radiator.

05:16.824 --> 05:20.159
Ooh!
This place is a paradise!

05:20.193 --> 05:23.579
Nicely done, Tom.
We have 15 sponsorship offers.

05:23.631 --> 05:25.548
Make that 16.
Mitch Savner.

05:25.582 --> 05:27.366
- Savner Bleaches and Chemicals!
- That's it.

05:27.384 --> 05:29.085
You guys make my favorite
teeth-whitening strips--

05:29.136 --> 05:30.202
pearlies for girlies.

05:30.220 --> 05:31.554
It's unisex.

05:31.588 --> 05:33.256
The cartoon princess
on the label says so.

05:33.307 --> 05:35.207
I'll sponsor your concert.

05:35.225 --> 05:36.542
But I'm also looking
to invest in other ventures.

05:36.560 --> 05:37.977
I have a feeling
a bright guy like you

05:38.012 --> 05:39.211
has some ideas of his own.

05:39.229 --> 05:41.230
I may have a few eggs
ready to hatch

05:41.265 --> 05:42.548
in the personal idea nest.

05:42.566 --> 05:44.434
Why don't you come
to my office tomorrow

05:44.485 --> 05:45.885
and pitch me your hottest idea?

05:45.903 --> 05:48.387
Perfect!
I'll see you then.

05:48.405 --> 05:49.555
Oh, that's pretty cool.

05:49.573 --> 05:51.240
It's all happening, Ben.

05:51.275 --> 05:53.493
Soon I'll have a new career,
new crib, new friends.

05:54.895 --> 05:56.696
If all goes well, this may be
one of the last times

05:56.730 --> 05:58.581
I ever have to speak to you.

05:58.615 --> 05:59.949
Come with me, I need your help.

06:01.535 --> 06:03.786
Thank you so much, everyone,
for coming.

06:03.837 --> 06:05.237
And a special thank you
to the city council

06:05.255 --> 06:06.739
for their support.

06:06.757 --> 06:08.074
I was told there'd be
a free barbecue buffet?

06:08.092 --> 06:10.126
Just take some beef jerky
and...hush!

06:10.177 --> 06:14.347
This spring we will be holding
a massive unity concert

06:14.381 --> 06:17.750
to commemorate the merger
between Pawnee and Eagleton.

06:17.768 --> 06:20.269
This three-day
music and arts festival

06:20.304 --> 06:23.723
will end on a day we will call
"New Founder's Day,"

06:23.757 --> 06:25.608
an official beginning
to our new town.

06:25.642 --> 06:27.310
A few years ago,

06:27.361 --> 06:29.479
Eagleton put up this wall
along the border.

06:29.530 --> 06:33.900
Now it is time
to tear down this wall.

06:35.536 --> 06:36.953
In the name of unity,

06:36.987 --> 06:40.039
I have given some former
Eagletonians the first strike.

06:40.074 --> 06:41.874
Take it away, guys.

06:45.045 --> 06:46.963
This is such a great day
for--

06:46.997 --> 06:48.331
Bees!

06:48.382 --> 06:49.665
Bees!
Oh!

06:49.717 --> 06:50.666
Nobody panic!

06:50.718 --> 06:52.618
Ohhh, noooo!

06:52.636 --> 06:54.804
Ah! It stung me
in the eyeball!

06:54.838 --> 06:57.757
Oh, man, this is amazing, man.

06:57.791 --> 06:59.258
The stupid Eagletonians

06:59.292 --> 07:01.677
are totally getting the pwned
by these bees.

07:01.729 --> 07:03.169
I'm gonna send this
straight to tosh.

07:03.180 --> 07:05.898
[Laughing]
Ow, [bleep]! [Bleep]!

07:05.933 --> 07:07.934
Don't worry, babe,
I'll protect you.

07:07.968 --> 07:09.402
I got stung once, I'm immune.

07:09.436 --> 07:11.904
Go ahead and sting me, bees.
It does nothing.

07:13.419 --> 07:17.106
Leslie, it appears that most of the people
that were stung were from Eagleton.

07:17.346 --> 07:18.513
How did you pull that off?

07:18.548 --> 07:19.965
I didn't pull anything off.

07:19.999 --> 07:22.017
The Eagletonians were simply
closest to the wall.

07:22.051 --> 07:25.303
Plus, one Pawneean was stung...
in his mouth

07:25.337 --> 07:27.057
because he was laughing
at the Eagletonians.

07:27.106 --> 07:29.941
How did you get your bees
into the wall,

07:29.976 --> 07:32.177
and how long did it take
to plan

07:32.195 --> 07:34.512
this hilarious bee prank
on Eagleton?

07:34.530 --> 07:37.315
They were not my bees, Trodd.

07:37.349 --> 07:39.951
And for the last time
this was not a prank.

07:39.986 --> 07:42.037
I did not know
that bees were in that wall.

07:42.071 --> 07:43.455
I mean, in fact
you should treat this

07:43.489 --> 07:44.706
like a public service
announcement.

07:44.740 --> 07:47.375
Everybody...should check
their walls for bees.

07:47.410 --> 07:49.294
Nice try, prank queen.
Probably bees in there.

07:49.328 --> 07:50.962
Okay, that's all the time
I have.

07:50.997 --> 07:52.297
What else can you do
with your bees?

07:52.331 --> 07:53.548
Leslie, what's your next prank?

07:53.583 --> 07:54.749
Ooh.

07:54.801 --> 07:56.718
Leslie, Grant Larson
is on the phone

07:56.752 --> 07:58.053
from the National Park Service.

07:58.087 --> 07:59.387
I cannot meet with him
right now.

07:59.422 --> 08:00.705
We are in crisis mode, okay?

08:00.723 --> 08:02.841
Larry, just tell him
I need to reschedule

08:02.875 --> 08:04.810
because I am trying
to fix my bee hole disaster.

08:04.844 --> 08:06.428
- Okeydokey.
- Wait! No, wait!

08:06.479 --> 08:08.180
No!
Larry, don't tell him that.

08:08.214 --> 08:09.815
Don't mention my bee hole.

08:09.849 --> 08:11.650
Just as we suspected, John.

08:11.684 --> 08:13.885
We repaired
the valve stem seal,

08:13.903 --> 08:15.887
and now all that remains
is to tighten down

08:15.905 --> 08:18.323
this packing nut.

08:18.357 --> 08:20.242
And...that should do it.

08:20.276 --> 08:21.610
Can we help you?

08:21.661 --> 08:24.579
No. We have everything
under control.

08:24.614 --> 08:26.397
My crew's redoing
this whole floor.

08:26.415 --> 08:28.233
We're the only people
allowed up here right now.

08:28.251 --> 08:31.086
Well, proceed with your work.
You won't notice us at all.

08:32.455 --> 08:33.788
We're gonna be kinda loud.

08:33.840 --> 08:36.758
My son is several weeks old.

08:36.792 --> 08:39.044
He's quite familiar
with the sound of power tools.

08:40.847 --> 08:43.914
Okay, how about this one--
Lasik for fingernails?

08:43.933 --> 08:46.751
Cut your fingernails once,
never have to cut 'em again.

08:46.769 --> 08:48.920
All we need
is a complicated laser

08:48.938 --> 08:50.355
I have no idea how to build.

08:50.389 --> 08:52.807
- Seems impossible.
- All right.

08:52.859 --> 08:56.144
Uh-oh! "Saltweens!"
Saltines for tweens.

08:56.195 --> 08:58.446
Seems...unnecessary?

08:59.565 --> 09:00.949
The only business idea I have

09:00.983 --> 09:02.617
that's even remotely
fleshed out is a restaurant.

09:02.652 --> 09:03.902
No way.

09:03.936 --> 09:05.437
Restaurants
were ranked number one

09:05.471 --> 09:07.989
in <i>Accounting Magazine's</i>
<i>"Riskiest Businesses" issue.</i>

09:08.040 --> 09:10.201
That was their last issue
before they folded, actually.

09:10.209 --> 09:11.493
Magazines are also very risky.

09:11.544 --> 09:12.827
I can't believe
an angel investor

09:12.879 --> 09:14.112
floated down from the heavens,

09:14.130 --> 09:15.547
and I don't even have
anything to pitch him.

09:15.581 --> 09:17.465
Come on, you must've had
one good business idea.

09:17.500 --> 09:18.967
You're 52 years old!

09:19.001 --> 09:21.419
No, I'm not.
But I do have an idea.

09:21.453 --> 09:22.721
It's air-tight.

09:22.755 --> 09:24.723
But I have to warn you,
it's not super sexy.

09:24.757 --> 09:27.309
- What is it?
- Okay, listen up.

09:27.343 --> 09:30.061
You would be the middleman
between dry cleaners

09:30.096 --> 09:32.681
and the companies
that sell chemicals...

09:32.732 --> 09:34.432
to dry cleaners.

09:34.466 --> 09:36.818
- Wow!
- Right?

09:36.852 --> 09:40.739
You're right, man.
That is <i>not</i> sexy.

09:40.773 --> 09:42.440
Leslie Knope's little stunt

09:42.474 --> 09:44.192
put three people
in the hospital.

09:44.243 --> 09:46.861
This bee incident
is just the latest assault

09:46.913 --> 09:48.914
coming from the Pawnee side
of this merger.

09:48.948 --> 09:51.482
Mike Patterson is Eagleton's
most tenacious reporter.

09:51.500 --> 09:52.851
When he sinks his teeth
into something,

09:52.885 --> 09:54.252
he's like a <i>dog with a bone!</i>

09:54.287 --> 09:55.587
Oh, my God!

09:55.621 --> 09:56.988
You can't lean in to whisper
and then yell.

09:57.006 --> 09:58.123
That's not fair.

09:58.157 --> 09:59.925
This merger is so fragile,

09:59.959 --> 10:01.259
everyone is on edge,

10:01.294 --> 10:02.994
and no one is talking
about the unity concert.

10:03.012 --> 10:04.713
Why would anybody think
that was a prank?

10:04.764 --> 10:06.131
So sad.
People will believe anything.

10:06.165 --> 10:07.325
It was a prank though, right?

10:07.333 --> 10:08.883
No more press, okay?

10:08.935 --> 10:10.719
You just have to lay low
for a while.

10:10.770 --> 10:12.387
I promise it'll all blow over.

10:12.438 --> 10:14.723
April, your competence
and your levelheadedness

10:14.774 --> 10:16.891
is very moving to me,
and I will follow your advice

10:16.943 --> 10:18.310
right after
I go to the hospital

10:18.344 --> 10:19.778
and apologize to every victim
in person.

10:19.812 --> 10:21.980
- Fine, but no cameras.
- Fine, I won't bring any.

10:22.014 --> 10:24.983
Aghh! I can't handle
all this fighting.

10:25.017 --> 10:26.952
It's like Thanksgiving 2004
all over again!

10:26.986 --> 10:28.903
Don't even ask!

10:28.955 --> 10:31.373
Somebody follow me,
I'm distraught!

10:31.407 --> 10:34.692
Who's a big guy?

10:34.710 --> 10:35.961
Man, forget about working.

10:35.995 --> 10:38.630
I just wanna stare
at this baby all day.

10:38.664 --> 10:41.299
What is the nature
of your work on this floor?

10:41.334 --> 10:43.701
Total redo--new floors,
fixtures, plumbing.

10:43.719 --> 10:45.136
How long will it take?

10:45.171 --> 10:47.038
Six to eight weeks.

10:47.056 --> 10:48.340
Deal.

10:48.374 --> 10:51.209
I will do all this work for you
in the time allotted.

10:51.227 --> 10:53.478
Just have your tools
and materials brought up here.

10:53.512 --> 10:54.712
Are you crazy?

10:54.730 --> 10:56.170
This is enough work
for a whole crew.

10:56.182 --> 10:57.582
I'm sure the government
believed you

10:57.600 --> 10:59.150
when you told them that,

10:59.185 --> 11:02.887
and I tip my cap to you for
profiting off their ignoe.

11:02.905 --> 11:04.990
But I'm offering you
two months paid vacation

11:05.024 --> 11:08.243
and the ability to take credit
for my work,

11:08.277 --> 11:11.079
which will be flawless.

11:11.113 --> 11:15.417
Okay.
Guys, let's go!

11:15.451 --> 11:17.369
I got all help I'll need
right here.

11:18.737 --> 11:20.705
Okay, this is
the really exciting part.

11:20.739 --> 11:24.292
We buy tetrachloroethylene
at $1.60 a gallon,

11:24.343 --> 11:26.628
but we sell it back
at 2.38 a gallon.

11:26.679 --> 11:28.213
Now I know
what you're thinking.

11:28.247 --> 11:31.132
What if it's a cleaner
who wants to buy glycol ethers?

11:31.183 --> 11:33.218
Ben, stop!

11:33.252 --> 11:34.752
This is so boring!

11:34.770 --> 11:36.087
This is like listening
to a TED talk

11:36.105 --> 11:37.272
by the color beige.

11:37.306 --> 11:40.025
Look, I know this idea
doesn't excite you.

11:40.059 --> 11:42.360
But I promise it'll make you
a lot of money.

11:42.395 --> 11:45.096
Well, I sold tons
of awesome stuff.

11:45.114 --> 11:46.481
Guess it makes sense
my next challenge

11:46.532 --> 11:48.817
is to sell something
mind-numbingly dull.

11:48.868 --> 11:50.768
Dull?

11:50.786 --> 11:53.905
Does this look dull to you?

11:53.939 --> 11:56.241
Ahhhh.

11:56.275 --> 11:58.293
I'm so incredibly sorry.

11:58.327 --> 12:00.495
That's very kind of you,
Ms. Knope.

12:00.546 --> 12:02.780
I hope you look a lot
less gross very soon.

12:04.166 --> 12:05.583
Hey!

12:05.617 --> 12:08.970
Thanks for coming, Knope.
I knew we were besties.

12:09.004 --> 12:10.924
What do you got in there for me,
some dirty mags?

12:10.956 --> 12:13.458
No! These gift baskets
are for innocent victims...

12:13.476 --> 12:15.260
not for jerks who got stung

12:15.294 --> 12:16.845
because they were laughing
at other people's pain.

12:16.896 --> 12:18.012
Whatever.

12:18.064 --> 12:19.630
Got a lotta filth
in my kindle anyway.

12:19.648 --> 12:21.266
We can just hang.

12:21.300 --> 12:23.234
- Wanna come up?
- What?

12:23.269 --> 12:24.302
- We gotta get this.
- Roll camera.

12:24.320 --> 12:26.020
Tell me when.
Is my hair okay?

12:26.072 --> 12:27.489
We good?

12:27.523 --> 12:29.491
Welcome to <i>Eagleton Now,</i>
<i>with Mike Patterson.</i>

12:29.525 --> 12:31.443
We're live
ambushing Leslie Knope

12:31.477 --> 12:33.478
who's in the middle
of a crass publicity stunt,

12:33.496 --> 12:35.063
shoving cameras cameras
into the faces

12:35.097 --> 12:36.698
of these poor, injured victims.

12:36.749 --> 12:39.701
These are <i>your</i> cameras.
This is not a publicity stunt.

12:39.752 --> 12:41.536
I just came here by myself

12:41.587 --> 12:43.838
to apologize to all
the Eagletonians who got stung.

12:43.873 --> 12:46.758
Really? Because all we see
is you talking to your friend,

12:46.792 --> 12:49.427
known Eagleton hater
Jeremy Jamm.

12:49.462 --> 12:51.596
Excuse me, Mike.
That's, uh, best friend.

12:51.630 --> 12:53.631
Pawneeans and Eagletonians
need to find a way

12:53.665 --> 12:55.850
to come together
and bury the hatchet.

12:55.885 --> 12:58.002
It doesn't matter
who bailed out who,

12:58.020 --> 12:59.721
or who seceded from you.

12:59.772 --> 13:01.106
Awesome idea, Lezzie.

13:01.140 --> 13:04.209
As a matter of fact I say
we should secede from Eagleton!

13:04.243 --> 13:06.745
Whose dumbass idea was it
for them to merge anyway?

13:06.779 --> 13:08.163
Mine. It was my idea.

13:08.214 --> 13:09.497
You heard it here first.

13:09.548 --> 13:11.883
Self-proclaimed dumbass
Leslie Knope

13:11.917 --> 13:13.468
and councilman Jeremy Jamm

13:13.502 --> 13:15.420
are spearheading
a Pawnee secession movement.

13:15.454 --> 13:17.305
And I, for one, am sick of it.

13:17.339 --> 13:19.123
All right, you know what,
Eagleton, enough!

13:19.141 --> 13:20.425
Get these cameras outta here!

13:20.459 --> 13:22.594
Don't touch my camera,
you Pawnee animal!

13:22.628 --> 13:23.928
Name-calling, huh?

13:23.962 --> 13:25.346
Classy move, douche bag.

13:25.397 --> 13:26.731
Oh! All right.

13:26.766 --> 13:28.266
Is that how you wanna play?

13:28.300 --> 13:30.318
- Yeah! Come on!
- No fighting in a hospital.

13:30.352 --> 13:31.992
There shouldn't be
fighting in a hospital!

13:32.021 --> 13:33.354
Wish I had my ninja stars!

13:33.405 --> 13:36.608
Oh, my God!
What's happening?

13:36.642 --> 13:37.859
Oh!

13:37.910 --> 13:39.915
Mother...puncher!

13:41.515 --> 13:43.464
Hey, girl.
What up?

13:43.704 --> 13:44.625
What are you wearing?

13:44.666 --> 13:46.622
It's to distract people
from my black eye.

13:46.673 --> 13:48.457
See?
It's working.

13:48.508 --> 13:52.695
Cool. Um...
well, there is some good news.

13:52.729 --> 13:56.415
That Mike Patterson guy's show
just aired, everyone is angry,

13:56.450 --> 13:58.634
and Jamm is introducing
a secession bill

13:58.685 --> 13:59.965
at the next
city council meeting.

13:59.970 --> 14:01.671
- How is any of that good news?
- It's not.

14:01.705 --> 14:03.806
I just wanted you to have
a brief moment of happiness

14:03.857 --> 14:04.974
before you got sadder.

14:05.025 --> 14:07.777
Those jerks that hate the merger
are a minority.

14:07.811 --> 14:09.691
They're just shouting louder
than everyone else.

14:09.696 --> 14:13.199
I'm sorry this town keeps being
stupid and letting you down.

14:13.233 --> 14:14.367
It sucks.

14:14.401 --> 14:15.985
It's okay, April.
It's fine.

14:16.036 --> 14:17.236
You know, it's a challenge.

14:17.270 --> 14:21.374
It's just like a big, fun...

14:21.408 --> 14:23.108
stinking turd nugget.
It sucks.

14:23.126 --> 14:24.443
You're right, everything sucks.

14:24.461 --> 14:26.962
Everything I try
with this merger backfires.

14:26.997 --> 14:30.166
I wonder what other
excellent surprise lies in store

14:30.217 --> 14:31.634
for Leslie Knope.

14:31.668 --> 14:33.668
Leslie, Grant Larson
from the National Park Service

14:33.670 --> 14:34.953
is here for your meeting.

14:34.971 --> 14:36.172
Excellent.

14:36.223 --> 14:38.641
Now I shall meet
with a very important person

14:38.675 --> 14:40.676
whilst sporting
a gruesome shiner.

14:40.727 --> 14:42.511
Hey, you're also wearing
a tie-dye t-shirt.

14:42.562 --> 14:45.681
Oh, yes! I am!

14:45.732 --> 14:47.316
Wonderful!

14:47.350 --> 14:48.651
Mitch!
Thanks for meeting me.

14:48.685 --> 14:49.819
My pleasure.

14:49.853 --> 14:52.137
It's not often
that I see someone

14:52.155 --> 14:54.523
with your sparkle and passion.

14:54.574 --> 14:56.575
That's what makes
businesses work--

14:56.610 --> 14:57.943
passion!

14:57.977 --> 15:00.663
So, Mr. Haverford,
let's get to it.

15:00.697 --> 15:03.916
What idea
are you passionate about?

15:05.535 --> 15:08.987
I've got two words for you--

15:09.005 --> 15:10.423
"Tom's Bistro,"

15:10.457 --> 15:13.292
an old-fashioned,
old-world Italian restaurant.

15:13.326 --> 15:16.262
Classy, authentic ambience
in a small-town setting.

15:16.296 --> 15:17.663
Why does that say

15:17.681 --> 15:20.349
"dry cleaning chemical
transactional holding company?"

15:20.383 --> 15:23.385
Ben! You brought
the wrong easel. God!

15:23.437 --> 15:26.138
Can't take this guy anywhere.
Let me paint you a picture.

15:26.172 --> 15:27.940
Oh, Mr. Larson, I'm sorry.

15:27.974 --> 15:30.443
I had to reschedule.
It's been kind of a hectic week.

15:30.477 --> 15:31.977
- What happened to your face?
- It doesn't matter.

15:32.011 --> 15:34.814
I would like to apply
to turn some of our new land

15:34.848 --> 15:36.282
into a national park.

15:36.316 --> 15:37.900
I read your request,
Ms. Knope,

15:37.951 --> 15:40.402
and I'm sorry,
but we can't make that happen.

15:40.454 --> 15:41.854
Great.

15:41.872 --> 15:44.189
Well, this week just keeps
getting better and better.

15:44.207 --> 15:46.325
Thank you for coming by
and plunging a dagger

15:46.359 --> 15:48.377
into my already-bleeding
corpse.

15:48.411 --> 15:51.363
I came here
because I wanted to meet you.

15:51.381 --> 15:53.799
I've actually wanted to meet you
since before you called me.

15:53.834 --> 15:55.801
- Really? You know who I am?
- Yes.

15:55.836 --> 15:58.254
You're the person
who wrote this.

15:58.305 --> 16:00.422
You read my proposal
to clean up the Pawnee river?

16:00.474 --> 16:01.807
I wrote this two years ago.

16:01.842 --> 16:04.260
Got shuffled around
in interior for a year and half.

16:04.311 --> 16:07.429
Liam Bonneville actually used it
to humiliate staffers, but...

16:07.481 --> 16:09.849
he's kind of a bad boy.

16:09.883 --> 16:11.267
Liam B--

16:11.318 --> 16:13.519
- You don't have to tell me!
- This report is legendary.

16:13.520 --> 16:15.237
It's easily
the most thoroughly research

16:15.272 --> 16:17.823
and passionate grant request
I've ever seen.

16:19.075 --> 16:21.327
Wow, you have no idea
how meaningful it is

16:21.361 --> 16:22.661
to hear you say that.

16:22.696 --> 16:24.029
But you're a little late.

16:24.063 --> 16:25.581
The river cleanup's
well underway.

16:25.615 --> 16:27.750
This is bigger
than the river cleanup.

16:27.784 --> 16:29.451
We're opening a new office
in Chicago.

16:29.503 --> 16:30.920
I spent the last few weeks

16:30.954 --> 16:32.338
reading about you
and your career

16:32.372 --> 16:34.123
and I think that you're
the perfect person to run it.

16:34.174 --> 16:37.009
Leslie, would you like
to run a branch

16:37.043 --> 16:39.077
of the National Park Service?

16:40.814 --> 16:43.098
Tom's Bistro will have
all the classic elements,

16:43.133 --> 16:44.466
but with modern twists--

16:44.518 --> 16:47.219
an oak bar, live music,

16:47.253 --> 16:49.672
and Sunday brunch
with scrambled eggs so fluffy

16:49.706 --> 16:51.690
they'll be like little pillows
for your bacon.

16:51.725 --> 16:54.310
Bacon pillows.
I like the sound of that.

16:54.361 --> 16:55.694
But I have to say,

16:55.729 --> 16:57.146
restaurants
are incredibly risky.

16:57.197 --> 17:00.599
Most of them
are dead on arrival.

17:00.617 --> 17:02.818
We're well-aware of that,

17:02.869 --> 17:05.119
but believe me,
Tom has thought this out.

17:05.155 --> 17:07.122
See, there's plenty
of real estate available

17:07.156 --> 17:09.491
in the old Eagleton
part of town.

17:09.542 --> 17:11.911
And with the recent closures,
there's massive demand

17:11.944 --> 17:15.548
for affordable dining
that feels high-end.

17:15.582 --> 17:17.967
Okay!

17:18.001 --> 17:20.386
As long as you're running,
I'm in.

17:20.420 --> 17:22.253
Amazing!

17:22.288 --> 17:23.505
Hey, kid...

17:23.557 --> 17:25.790
your boss here
sure knows his stuff.

17:32.432 --> 17:34.433
Ron.
What are you doing here?

17:34.467 --> 17:36.569
The most important
government work I've ever done--

17:36.603 --> 17:39.137
sanding rat urine stains
out of this floor.

17:39.155 --> 17:40.573
What are you doing here?

17:40.607 --> 17:42.324
I come here to think sometimes.

17:42.359 --> 17:44.109
By myself.

17:44.143 --> 17:46.445
- But now that you're here...
- Damn it.

17:46.479 --> 17:47.947
I am going to speak to you
very vaguely

17:47.981 --> 17:49.448
about a problem that I have,

17:49.482 --> 17:52.034
and you cannot ask me any
questions or details about it.

17:52.085 --> 17:55.454
That is my ideal conversation,
aside from no conversation.

17:55.488 --> 17:56.922
But that feels unlikely.

17:56.957 --> 17:59.324
Look, you know how much
I love Pawnee.

17:59.342 --> 18:02.511
But the more I try to fix it
the more people fight me.

18:02.545 --> 18:04.513
They call me names,
they recall me,

18:04.547 --> 18:06.498
they try to kill the merger.

18:06.516 --> 18:08.884
They literally punch me
in the face.

18:08.935 --> 18:12.054
And yet every time
I contemplate leaving,

18:12.105 --> 18:15.975
just walking away
once and for all,

18:16.009 --> 18:18.477
I just can't do it.

18:18.511 --> 18:23.181
What is wrong with me?

18:23.199 --> 18:26.018
Yesterday, I fixed
that old steam radiator.

18:26.036 --> 18:28.320
Threaded a new valve
into the side,

18:28.354 --> 18:29.989
removed the handle
from the base,

18:30.023 --> 18:32.541
unscrewed the packing nut
from the stem.

18:32.575 --> 18:35.527
This subpar toolbox
only had one wrench,

18:35.545 --> 18:37.963
so I was lucky
it was a three-quarters

18:37.998 --> 18:39.248
or I'd have been screwed.

18:39.299 --> 18:40.966
Yeah, man, you are lucky.

18:41.001 --> 18:42.217
Come on, Ron.

18:42.252 --> 18:43.419
What the hell?
I need your help.

18:43.470 --> 18:45.220
By the time I was done,

18:45.255 --> 18:48.140
this 100-year-old piece
of American-made cast iron

18:48.174 --> 18:50.509
was singing like a bird.

18:50.543 --> 18:53.378
Now...to most people,
this story would seem boring.

18:53.396 --> 18:55.714
That's ridiculous.
It's a story about a radiator.

18:55.732 --> 18:58.550
But to me,
it was immensely satisfying

18:58.568 --> 19:01.987
because I enjoy
fixing radiators.

19:02.022 --> 19:05.357
You like fixing this town,
Leslie, you always have.

19:05.391 --> 19:08.610
You know it's an uphill battle,
but you love the struggle.

19:08.662 --> 19:11.080
I would also add
that you've already done

19:11.114 --> 19:12.948
a hell of a lot
to make this town better,

19:12.999 --> 19:15.784
and people
like this young man here

19:15.835 --> 19:17.736
will benefit
from your hard work.

19:17.754 --> 19:20.122
- He is a beautiful boy.
- He's quite a looker.

19:20.156 --> 19:22.291
Thank you, Ron.

19:25.595 --> 19:26.962
- What's that?
- Nothing.

19:27.013 --> 19:29.765
Clearing my throat.

19:32.789 --> 19:34.903
I've been thinking about your offer.

19:35.802 --> 19:37.842
And I have to say I can't think
of one single reason

19:37.867 --> 19:39.000
not to take it.

19:39.035 --> 19:40.401
That's great!

19:40.419 --> 19:41.837
I'll start drawing up
the paperwork.

19:41.871 --> 19:44.039
I'm sorry, I meant...

19:44.073 --> 19:45.957
because I can think
of a lot of reasons

19:46.008 --> 19:47.242
not to take it.

19:47.260 --> 19:50.411
Okay, wow, that's very
misleading phraseology.

19:50.429 --> 19:51.796
I'm sorry.

19:51.848 --> 19:53.715
It's an amazing offer
and I'm very interested,

19:53.749 --> 19:56.218
but if I'm going
to leave Pawnee...

19:56.252 --> 19:58.220
I need to know
it's gonna be okay without me.

19:58.254 --> 20:01.773
And I won't know until I finish
what I've started.

20:01.807 --> 20:03.225
When do you need your answer?

20:03.259 --> 20:05.143
Well, the gears
of federal government

20:05.194 --> 20:07.428
grind pretty slowly,
so you have a little time.

20:07.446 --> 20:10.866
But we can't wait forever.
I'll be in touch.

20:10.900 --> 20:12.951
Great. Thank you.

20:12.985 --> 20:14.736
That's not your hand.
Here it is.

20:14.770 --> 20:17.572
Sorry, my depth perception
is totally screwed up.

20:17.606 --> 20:19.908
Really happy that worked out
for you, Tom,

20:19.942 --> 20:22.377
but you kinda sold me out
back there.

20:22.411 --> 20:23.879
I know, and I'm sorry.

20:23.913 --> 20:26.665
But Mitch asked me
what I was passionate about,

20:26.716 --> 20:28.783
and honestly
I'm never gonna be passionate

20:28.801 --> 20:30.135
about dry cleaning chemicals.

20:30.169 --> 20:31.636
To each his own, I guess.

20:31.671 --> 20:33.138
I know opening a restaurant
is risky,

20:33.172 --> 20:34.556
but I can make this work.

20:34.590 --> 20:36.258
I know I can!

20:36.292 --> 20:38.927
Then count me in
as the second investor

20:38.961 --> 20:40.178
in Tom's Bistro.

20:40.229 --> 20:41.313
Thanks, man.

20:41.347 --> 20:43.798
I know this is
a symbolic gesture,

20:43.832 --> 20:45.800
but my investor floor
is $1,000.

20:45.834 --> 20:47.335
So as of now,
you own zero shares.

20:47.353 --> 20:49.054
Cool!
Thanks for clearing that up.

20:49.105 --> 20:50.838
Now go do work,
or I will fire you.

20:50.856 --> 20:52.057
I'm not kidding.

20:52.108 --> 20:53.841
Yep!

20:55.678 --> 20:57.312
Oh, look, John.
It's red pine.

20:57.346 --> 21:00.031
They were gonna put
flecked linoleum

21:00.066 --> 21:03.084
over this beautifully preserved
knotty red pine.

21:03.119 --> 21:06.571
Most people in this world,
John, are ass[bleep].

21:06.622 --> 21:08.073
This is the best day
I've ever spent

21:08.124 --> 21:09.741
in a government building,

21:09.792 --> 21:11.993
and luckily my son
was here to share it with me.

21:12.028 --> 21:13.828
He now has that satisfied look

21:13.862 --> 21:17.031
that only comes
with the pride of labor.

21:17.049 --> 21:17.915
Or he pooped.

21:18.953 --> 21:21.819
Either way, well done, John.
