05:11.420 --> 05:14.500
He was possessed...
By an extremely powerful

05:14.500 --> 05:15.790
Greater Demon,
who gave him the ability

from the Silent City archives.

05:47.830 --> 05:50.420
She's the mother of all demons.

05:50.420 --> 05:51.540

how did he come back?

I've known Jace
a lot longer than you have.

27:07.790 --> 27:09.670
Before, all he cared
about was the hunt.

27:09.670 --> 27:10.880
Yeah.

27:10.880 --> 27:12.790
Then he met you,

27:12.790 --> 27:14.710
and it was like he woke up
from a deep sleep.

27:16.620 --> 27:18.420
From that day on...

27:18.420 --> 27:19.790
he became a different Jace.

27:21.500 --> 27:22.830
A happier Jace.
