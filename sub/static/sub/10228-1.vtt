00:47.673 --> 00:50.643
Was it Dillinger
got shot through the eyeball

00:50.717 --> 00:52.890
or am I thinking
of somebody else?

00:52.970 --> 00:56.315
Moe Greene got shot through
the eyeball in The Godfather.

00:56.431 --> 00:58.900
Yeah, I'm talking about
in real life. LARRY: Oh.

00:58.976 --> 01:01.729
Somebody in real life
got shot through the eyeball.

01:01.812 --> 01:03.439
Who was that?

01:03.522 --> 01:04.739
Well, no, Larry,

01:04.815 --> 01:06.817
many people in real life have
got shot through the eyeball.

01:06.900 --> 01:09.028
I'm just saying I think
Dillinger was one of them.

01:09.152 --> 01:10.825
That's really good aim.

01:10.904 --> 01:13.077
No, that ain't really good aim.

01:13.156 --> 01:14.453
How is that not
really good aim, Tommy?

01:14.533 --> 01:17.161
That's 100 fucking cops shooting
1,000 bullets a minute.

01:17.244 --> 01:20.214
One of them's bound to go through
somebody's fucking eyeball.

01:20.289 --> 01:21.290
Oh.

01:23.000 --> 01:26.004
Eyeball. Eyeball,
eyeball, eyeball.

01:26.128 --> 01:28.256
You ever shoot
a guy in his eyeball?

01:28.338 --> 01:30.807
I stabbed a guy
in his ear once,

01:30.882 --> 01:32.805
ice pick,
right in his fucking ear.

01:32.884 --> 01:36.639
Yeah, see, that'd be a different subject.
That'd be "ears."

01:37.639 --> 01:39.437
What's the matter
with you, Tommy?

01:39.516 --> 01:41.109
Nothing's the matter with me.

01:41.184 --> 01:42.985
Are you nervous because
we're killing a chick?

01:43.020 --> 01:46.866
Yeah, look at me, I'm shaking. I
got the chick-killing shakes.

02:01.788 --> 02:03.508
The last thing
the boss says to me, he says,

02:03.540 --> 02:07.010
"Tommy, the moment I first saw
Angela's eyes, I knew it."

02:07.085 --> 02:12.433
"I knew it was love, I knew I was fucked.
And lo and behold, I was."

02:13.175 --> 02:15.303
"So, Tommy, the moment
after you kill her,

02:15.844 --> 02:20.190
please, shoot her fucking eyeballs
out." Those were his exact words.

02:20.724 --> 02:22.943
I got one exact word for that.

02:23.602 --> 02:24.979
"Overkill."

02:25.562 --> 02:28.111
I got two exact words
for that, "Hear, hear."

02:29.399 --> 02:31.822
I got three
exact words for that.

02:31.902 --> 02:33.154
"You're damn
fucking straight."

02:34.029 --> 02:38.626
In Cuba, the torturers used to have
a device, two thin metal spikes,

02:39.242 --> 02:41.586
placed here,
that they adjusted,

02:42.663 --> 02:46.588
and slowly, millimeter by millimeter,
pricked into the eyeballs.

02:47.084 --> 02:49.382
You're kidding me? Those
Communist motherfuckers.

02:49.461 --> 02:51.805
Well, no, Larry.
These are the ones

02:51.880 --> 02:54.133
those Communist
motherfuckers kicked out.

02:54.216 --> 02:55.809
What is it with
you today, Tommy?

02:55.884 --> 02:57.431
First it's should
we or shouldn't we

02:57.511 --> 02:58.683
shoot this chick
through the eyeballs,

02:58.762 --> 03:00.810
and second,
it's you've gone soft...

03:24.329 --> 03:26.878
<i>Hey, Martin, it's your
agent calling again.</i>

03:26.957 --> 03:29.380
<i>Just wondering when we're gonna
see that new screenplay of yours.</i>

03:29.459 --> 03:31.052
<i>I'm not sure
what the holdup is,</i>

03:31.128 --> 03:33.381
<i>but the old clock's
ticking, buddy,</i>

03:33.463 --> 03:35.591
<i>so give me a call, okay?</i>

03:56.027 --> 03:57.700
Hiya, Kaya.

03:57.821 --> 03:59.494
Martin's writing today, Billy.

04:00.782 --> 04:03.786
Should I just stand
outside like a dick, then?

04:07.956 --> 04:09.674
You doing yoga?

04:09.750 --> 04:11.593
Was.
Can I watch?

04:13.336 --> 04:14.679
What happened to you?

04:15.338 --> 04:17.180
I got in a fight
at my audition.

04:17.507 --> 04:19.180
Who with this time?

04:19.509 --> 04:20.726
The director guy.

04:20.802 --> 04:22.053
He broke his nose.

04:22.179 --> 04:24.020
How are you ever
gonna get a job, Billy,

04:24.055 --> 04:26.854
if you break the director guy's
nose before you even got the part?

04:26.933 --> 04:28.025
I didn't mean
to break his nose.

04:28.101 --> 04:30.604
His nose was just in the middle
of where I was punching.

04:31.396 --> 04:32.693
I'm going to work.

04:32.773 --> 04:34.150
Are you pissed at me
for something, baby?

04:34.232 --> 04:36.860
Why would I be
pissed at you, Marty?

04:39.696 --> 04:42.040
Because you're a cunt.
Billy!

04:45.202 --> 04:47.363
I don't remember doing
anything to piss her off.

04:47.412 --> 04:48.538
Don't worry about it.

04:48.622 --> 04:50.624
She's probably pissed at you
not for anything specific,

04:50.707 --> 04:52.926
more because
she's a fucking bitch.

04:53.001 --> 04:57.222
She's not a fucking bitch, Billy.
She's just got issues.

04:57.297 --> 05:00.267
Yeah, she's got issues. She's got
"being a fucking bitch" issues.

05:00.675 --> 05:02.395
When are you gonna
get a girlfriend anyway?

05:02.427 --> 05:04.600
Why do I have to do
all this shit on my own?

05:04.679 --> 05:07.057
Maybe I've already
got a girlfriend.

05:07.140 --> 05:09.108
A girlfriend I can't
tell you anything about

05:09.184 --> 05:10.777
in the interests
of your own safety.

05:11.019 --> 05:13.238
That just means you
haven't got a girlfriend.

05:13.313 --> 05:16.533
Proof be if need proof...
Never mind.

05:16.608 --> 05:17.609
Huh?

05:17.692 --> 05:19.410
Proof be if need be.

05:21.988 --> 05:23.786
And how's everything in the
dog-kidnapping business?

05:23.865 --> 05:27.244
Dog- "borrowing"  business. I
ain't talking about that shit neither.

05:27.369 --> 05:29.246
Dog-borrowing business.

06:13.164 --> 06:14.165
Oh!

06:14.249 --> 06:15.466
Big boy.

06:16.084 --> 06:18.462
His name's Abel.

06:25.343 --> 06:27.061
Hi. Is this your dog?

06:27.137 --> 06:28.434
Oh, my God!

06:30.640 --> 06:33.189
I have to pay you.
No, please. I can't.

06:33.310 --> 06:35.938
Take this. Thank you so much.
Are you serious?

06:39.274 --> 06:42.198
Hey, hey. So where
do you wanna go, Hans,

06:42.277 --> 06:43.995
now that we're back
in the money?

06:44.362 --> 06:46.456
The cancer ward,
Billy, if you don't mind.

06:46.531 --> 06:48.750
One cancer ward
coming right up.

06:55.999 --> 07:00.505
Five hundred bucks, baby. A blonde
lady with a big fat basset hound.

07:02.422 --> 07:05.972
When you gonna get a job that ain't
just stealing from folks, Hans?

07:06.343 --> 07:09.347
I'm a 63-year-old,
ain't worked in 20 years.

07:09.429 --> 07:11.397
Myra, where am I
gonna get a job?

07:11.723 --> 07:13.191
Government.

07:13.516 --> 07:14.938
Government?

07:15.018 --> 07:18.648
"A job that ain't just
stealing from folks"?

07:19.773 --> 07:21.150
Government?

07:22.067 --> 07:23.990
Psst! Eh?

07:24.069 --> 07:25.616
Government.

07:26.404 --> 07:27.496
Eh?

07:28.031 --> 07:29.783
Five hundred bucks for a dog.

07:31.868 --> 07:34.212
Come on.
I'm gonna put it here,

07:34.287 --> 07:35.755
and you can take it
if you want.

07:52.055 --> 07:54.433
<i>So how's the Seven
Psychopaths coming along, Marty?</i>

07:55.016 --> 07:56.393
Slow, slow.

07:56.893 --> 07:58.691
I got the title.

07:59.479 --> 08:01.573
Just haven't been able to come
up with all the psychopaths yet.

08:01.648 --> 08:03.321
How many you got?
One.

08:03.441 --> 08:04.658
And he ain't really
much of a psychopath.

08:04.734 --> 08:07.408
He's more of a,
kind of a Buddhist.

08:08.446 --> 08:09.823
A Buddhist?

08:10.407 --> 08:12.455
Yeah. See, I'm sick of
all these stereotypical

08:12.534 --> 08:15.788
Hollywood murderous
scumbag-type psychopath movies.

08:15.954 --> 08:17.315
I don't want it
to be one more film

08:17.372 --> 08:18.840
about guys with
guns in their hands.

08:18.915 --> 08:23.386
I want it, overall,
to be about love and peace.

08:24.337 --> 08:25.930
But it still has to be about
these seven psychopaths,

08:26.006 --> 08:27.724
so this Buddhist psychopath,

08:27.799 --> 08:30.803
he doesn't believe in violence.

08:31.928 --> 08:34.647
I don't know what the fuck
he's gonna do in the movie.

08:35.765 --> 08:39.110
Maybe he could
karate chop somebody.

08:40.812 --> 08:42.109
You know?

08:44.774 --> 08:47.869
So what happens to the seven
psychopaths at the end?

08:47.944 --> 08:50.993
I don't know what happens
to them at the start.

08:52.657 --> 08:53.704
Oops!

08:53.783 --> 08:55.285
Yeah, it'll be all right.

08:55.952 --> 08:59.627
Hey. Shit in my pants,

08:59.706 --> 09:02.835
I got a psychopath
fool you can write about.

09:02.917 --> 09:04.635
Did you see this thing
in the paper the other day

09:04.711 --> 09:06.759
about those two Mafia guys
who got whacked?

09:08.131 --> 09:09.428
How about this?

09:09.507 --> 09:12.226
There's a serial killer
going around, a major whacko.

09:12.302 --> 09:14.725
However, he ain't like your
usual limp-ass serial killer,

09:14.804 --> 09:16.772
tie up a freckle-headed
hitchhiker on a highway.

09:16.848 --> 09:19.647
No, this guy, he's got a
little bit more integrity.

09:19.851 --> 09:23.276
This serial killer will only kill
mid-to high-ranking members

09:23.354 --> 09:25.903
of the Italian-American
organized crime syndicate.

09:27.567 --> 09:29.069
Or the Yakuza.

09:32.447 --> 09:34.245
That's a great
fucking psychopath, Billy.

09:34.616 --> 09:35.742
Do you think?

09:36.659 --> 09:40.038
A serial killer
who will only kill

09:40.747 --> 09:44.502
mid-to high-ranking members of the
Italian organized crime syndicate.

09:44.709 --> 09:47.428
Or the Yakuza.
Yakuza.

09:48.463 --> 09:50.306
I'll keep with the Mafia,
saves doing Jap dialogue.

09:50.381 --> 09:51.507
Good idea.

09:52.050 --> 09:55.975
That's a great fucking psychopath, Billy.
Can I keep him?

09:56.179 --> 09:59.524
You can if you let me
help write the movie with you.

10:02.477 --> 10:06.027
You can keep him, Marty,
I'm just kidding you.

10:37.679 --> 10:40.102
<i>The daughter of
a Quaker went missing.</i>

10:45.186 --> 10:47.439
<i>And when she was discovered,
the slit in her throat</i>

10:47.522 --> 10:51.072
<i>turned out to be the least
of the damage done to her.</i>

10:51.234 --> 10:54.283
<i>Her killer, whose name
shall not be noted,</i>

10:55.029 --> 10:57.703
<i>could not bear the guilt
and the horror, he said,</i>

10:57.907 --> 10:59.659
<i>and a year to the day
of her death,</i>

10:59.742 --> 11:02.416
<i>he walked into a police
station and gave himself up.</i>

11:03.079 --> 11:06.333
<i>And though he asked for execution,
the judge gave him life,</i>

11:07.625 --> 11:11.926
<i>and the killer was sent off to Sing
Sing to serve out his sentence.</i>

11:14.757 --> 11:17.761
<i>Seventeen long years went by.</i>

11:18.761 --> 11:20.809
<i>The killer found religion.</i>

11:23.558 --> 11:26.528
<i>And was sincere about it.
He had changed.</i>

11:26.978 --> 11:30.824
<i>And if he had ever been a psychopath,
he was not one any more.</i>

11:34.903 --> 11:36.155
<i>This story isn't about him.</i>

11:46.289 --> 11:47.711
<i>Many more years went by</i>

11:47.790 --> 11:50.384
<i>and the authorities finally
realized that it wasn't a scam,</i>

11:50.460 --> 11:54.306
<i>that he did truly mean it.
That he had truly repented.</i>

11:54.547 --> 11:56.970
<i>And they decided
to set him free.</i>

12:09.103 --> 12:11.151
<i>And he found himself
a place to stay</i>

12:11.940 --> 12:14.238
<i>and he determined
to live a simple,</i>

12:14.317 --> 12:16.786
<i>joyous life in the years
now left to him.</i>

12:57.527 --> 13:01.122
<i>A simple, joyous life
was not what was left to him.</i>

13:13.543 --> 13:16.092
<i>This went on for
11 fucking years,</i>

13:16.170 --> 13:17.763
<i>till finally
the killer went mad.</i>

13:21.259 --> 13:24.604
<i>And one winter night, while recalling
a Catholic tract he'd read,</i>

13:24.721 --> 13:28.771
<i>which stated that the only people
guaranteed a place in Hell</i>

13:28.850 --> 13:31.569
<i>were not murderers,
were not rapists,</i>

13:31.644 --> 13:34.648
<i>but were those who had
died by their own hand.</i>

13:35.732 --> 13:38.986
<i>The killer accepted
such an idea as beautiful,</i>

13:39.068 --> 13:43.039
<i>for he knew that at least in Hell
the Quaker would not be there.</i>

13:51.289 --> 13:53.633
<i>So he cut his own throat open,</i>

13:54.167 --> 13:56.795
<i>and the last thing
that the killer ever saw</i>

13:57.920 --> 14:01.265
<i>was the old man take out
a cut-throat razor of his own,</i>

14:02.508 --> 14:04.306
<i>put it to his throat,</i>

14:06.304 --> 14:07.806
<i>and slice.</i>

14:32.622 --> 14:34.499
Where were you
walking him, Sharice?

14:35.083 --> 14:36.881
The La Brea Tar Pits.

14:36.959 --> 14:38.927
Mr. Costello,
please don't hurt me.

14:39.003 --> 14:41.301
I promise,
I didn't mean to lose Bonny.

14:41.381 --> 14:44.055
I just turned
around and he was gone.

14:45.343 --> 14:47.937
If it was a genuine error,
Sharice,

14:48.012 --> 14:51.061
if it wasn't your fault
and he just run off,

14:51.349 --> 14:52.601
why did you run off,

14:52.683 --> 14:57.063
have us piss away 12 hours
just to find your fat ass?

14:58.189 --> 15:00.442
You love your dog
so much, Mr. Costello,

15:00.525 --> 15:02.323
and you're such
an angry-type person,

15:02.485 --> 15:06.490
I didn't think you'd listen to anything
I had to say about losing Bonny.

15:06.614 --> 15:08.082
You'd just think
it was my fault

15:08.157 --> 15:11.127
and drag me back here
and tie me up and kill me.

15:12.620 --> 15:15.920
Well, yeah,
that was a pretty good...

15:16.707 --> 15:17.959
Yeah.
Oh.

15:19.335 --> 15:20.336
Yeah.

15:26.384 --> 15:28.011
You should get a new one, boss.

15:28.094 --> 15:31.018
I know, but I like
the handle, the blue.

15:31.389 --> 15:34.188
I'm sorry about this, Sharice.
What it is, I don't oil it.

15:34.267 --> 15:39.239
Please, Mr. Costello, I always loved
Bonny like he was my own child.

15:39.689 --> 15:43.193
One, I do not want
that image in my head.

15:43.317 --> 15:45.365
Two, you shouldn't
take advantage

15:45.486 --> 15:48.410
just because my gun
got stuck by accident.

15:48.489 --> 15:50.207
Because that's low.

15:52.201 --> 15:53.748
There's been a bunch
of dog disappearances

15:53.828 --> 15:56.707
down by the La Brea
Tar Pits, I heard.

15:57.123 --> 16:00.548
This Norwegian chick I was
banging, she got her dog back.

16:00.626 --> 16:02.128
Been missing a couple of days.

16:02.211 --> 16:03.383
Gave the guy a big reward,

16:03.463 --> 16:05.863
then she started to think there
was something fishy about it.

16:06.382 --> 16:07.382
She asked around.

16:07.425 --> 16:09.266
Same thing happened
to three people down there.

16:10.386 --> 16:15.108
And, I'm sorry, Dennis, when
were you gonna mention this?

16:15.183 --> 16:16.730
I'd have mentioned it
straight off

16:16.809 --> 16:19.608
if I hadn't been looking
for fat-ass all night.

16:19.770 --> 16:21.067
Dennis,

16:23.733 --> 16:26.327
could you go make
some inquiries?

16:26.402 --> 16:29.747
Get my fucking dog back for me.

16:31.324 --> 16:32.701
Sure, boss.

16:34.035 --> 16:35.252
What about fatso?

16:38.873 --> 16:41.501
She still lost my
fucking dog, man.

16:51.093 --> 16:54.063
Just kidding, Sharice.
You can go.

17:00.978 --> 17:04.573
You think I'm gonna
see Wendy again when I go?

17:04.648 --> 17:08.449
We'll both see her again, baby,
but not anytime too soon.

17:11.446 --> 17:15.372
You ever worry we was
wrong all those years,

17:15.492 --> 17:18.212
and there ain't no Heaven
and there ain't no nothing?

17:18.287 --> 17:23.167
Of course I worry, but God loves us.
I know He does.

17:23.251 --> 17:26.300
He's just got a funny way
of showing it sometimes.

17:27.128 --> 17:30.383
Sometimes I think
God's gone crazy sometimes.

17:31.217 --> 17:34.221
Stuff He does,
stuff He don't do.

17:34.303 --> 17:37.853
Well, He's had a lot to contend
with in his time, too, you know.

17:37.932 --> 17:40.151
Bastards killed His kid, too.

17:40.268 --> 17:42.020
Don't say "bastards," honey.

17:42.103 --> 17:43.980
It's just a word, Myra.

17:45.523 --> 17:47.651
It's just a word, you know.

17:51.529 --> 17:52.655
"Bastards."

18:14.552 --> 18:17.806
You're gonna have a nice
time tonight, Billy. Relax.

18:19.974 --> 18:22.318
He's your best friend,
ain't he?

18:24.312 --> 18:28.033
Kaya ain't so bad. it ain't her
fault she's a fucking bitch.

18:29.150 --> 18:32.495
Must be hard coming all the
way here from Australia.

18:34.363 --> 18:37.537
Or New Zealand. Or wherever
the fuck she came from.

18:37.783 --> 18:40.707
Hey, I'm Billy.
Billy Bickie.

18:41.370 --> 18:44.294
What's your name?
I didn't catch your name.

18:45.583 --> 18:47.210
Hey. Come again?

18:48.336 --> 18:51.010
Dimitri, I like that.
Where you from?

18:55.384 --> 18:57.307
Hey, happy birthday.

18:57.887 --> 18:59.059
Hey, Bonny.

18:59.180 --> 19:01.182
We'll get you back to your
daddy in a day or two.

19:01.265 --> 19:02.608
Don't be sad.

19:03.434 --> 19:07.234
That's good. You're not sad.
Oh, you're happy!

19:08.105 --> 19:09.197
Paw.

19:09.690 --> 19:10.737
Paw.

19:12.735 --> 19:15.079
No paw. That's okay, too.

19:17.198 --> 19:19.917
<i>And the last thing
that the killer ever saw</i>

19:20.326 --> 19:22.875
was the Quaker take out
a cut-throat razor,

19:22.953 --> 19:25.627
put it to his own throat,
and slice.

19:25.998 --> 19:27.170
MANI Ah.

19:27.583 --> 19:28.630
Wow.

19:30.002 --> 19:31.595
What's up, Bickie?
Don't you get it?

19:32.088 --> 19:33.340
On, I get it.

19:33.422 --> 19:34.844
You don't look like you get it.

19:34.924 --> 19:36.801
Maybe it ain't clear enough.

19:36.884 --> 19:39.433
Maybe I should have
had you write it with me.

19:40.513 --> 19:43.107
Maybe you just
drink too much, Marty.

19:44.892 --> 19:46.360
What did you just say?

19:46.811 --> 19:48.984
You're a dog kidnapper, Billy.

19:49.063 --> 19:51.816
I'm taking advice on drinking
from a dog kidnapper.

19:51.941 --> 19:53.909
I ain't a dog kidnapper, Marty.

19:53.984 --> 19:55.031
Stop it, Martin.

19:55.111 --> 19:56.704
Don't you fucking start.

19:56.779 --> 19:58.122
Yeah, don't you fucking start.

19:58.197 --> 19:59.369
Don't talk to her like that!

19:59.448 --> 20:00.950
You started it.
Oh.

20:02.618 --> 20:03.870
Shut up!

20:10.418 --> 20:12.170
Kaya, that Quaker story,

20:12.253 --> 20:14.631
I told Marty that story
in a bar two months ago.

20:14.755 --> 20:16.177
A friend of mine
told that to me.

20:16.257 --> 20:19.727
So there might be copyright
issues, at the very least.

20:22.430 --> 20:23.898
What are youse looking at?

20:23.973 --> 20:25.725
I'm gonna go, okay?

20:26.058 --> 20:27.275
Um...

20:27.643 --> 20:30.897
Thanks for... It was a nice party.
You look nice.

20:55.755 --> 20:59.805
What you doing, honey? Ain't
you getting undressed?

21:01.260 --> 21:06.437
If I could massacre every person
in this godforsaken country...

21:07.558 --> 21:10.562
...that helped
tear apart mine, I would.

21:11.687 --> 21:16.363
I must focus, however, on the
gruesome task I have in hand.

21:17.443 --> 21:20.413
What are you talking,
baby? Chinese?

21:21.363 --> 21:24.037
Vietnamese. Vietnamese.

21:25.534 --> 21:28.834
Vietnamese. Yeah, didn't
we have like a big war

21:28.913 --> 21:29.960
with you guys one time?

21:30.873 --> 21:31.920
Yes.

21:36.045 --> 21:37.547
It isn't over.

22:04.281 --> 22:06.909
What am I doing at
your place, Billy?

22:07.535 --> 22:09.412
Kaya threw you out.

22:11.247 --> 22:13.545
What did Kaya throw me out for?

22:13.916 --> 22:15.634
You don't remember?

22:18.921 --> 22:20.423
For calling her a fucking bitch

22:20.506 --> 22:22.929
in front of all of her friends.

22:25.052 --> 22:26.725
I'd never do that.

22:27.847 --> 22:29.849
At least not to her face.

22:30.891 --> 22:32.939
Well, call her up and see.

22:33.269 --> 22:34.361
Huh?

22:34.937 --> 22:36.985
Well, call her up and see.

22:55.457 --> 22:56.549
Huh?

23:00.588 --> 23:01.635
<i>Hello?</i>

23:01.714 --> 23:05.435
Honey, listen, I can't exactly
remember what happened last night.

23:05.509 --> 23:07.637
<i>Do the words, "My girlfriend's
a fucking bitch,"</i>

23:07.720 --> 23:09.472
<i>mean anything to you?</i>

23:13.225 --> 23:16.229
Poodles always look
like they've been crying.

23:17.646 --> 23:20.525
Maybe they've just got
dumped by their girlfriend

23:20.691 --> 23:24.321
because they've got
a drinking problem, too.

23:24.987 --> 23:28.082
I don't have a drinking problem.
I just like drinking.

23:28.198 --> 23:29.791
Of course you do, Marty.

23:29.867 --> 23:31.414
One, you're a writer.

23:31.493 --> 23:33.211
Two, you're from Ireland.

23:33.287 --> 23:35.631
It's part of your heritage.
You're fucked!

23:35.706 --> 23:37.583
Fuck off now, Billy!
Seriously, just fuck off now!

23:37.666 --> 23:40.044
I'm not in the fucking mood!

23:40.836 --> 23:42.964
You were fucked from birth.

23:43.464 --> 23:47.185
Spanish have got bullfighting.
The French got cheese.

23:47.551 --> 23:50.054
And the Irish
have got alcoholism.

23:51.013 --> 23:52.515
And what have
the Americans got?

23:56.769 --> 23:58.112
Tolerance.

24:02.191 --> 24:04.785
<i>Oh. Shoot, you're reading
LA Weekly, are you? Huh?</i>

24:04.985 --> 24:06.157
On.

24:06.236 --> 24:08.364
<i>Shoot, you're reading
LA Weekly, are you?</i>

24:09.531 --> 24:11.033
No, no, no.

24:11.742 --> 24:13.119
No, no, no.

24:14.286 --> 24:15.833
No, no, no.

24:17.748 --> 24:20.752
Shoot, did I leave
any water in Bonny's bowl?

24:21.251 --> 24:23.720
I'd better go home and
do that, and while I do,

24:23.796 --> 24:26.345
<i>there's something I put in the LA
Weekly that you should maybe read.</i>

24:26.423 --> 24:28.300
'Cause it's possible
in the short term

24:28.384 --> 24:29.510
that you might be
slightly mad at me.

24:29.718 --> 24:30.799
What are you talking about?

24:30.803 --> 24:32.396
Page 163.

24:38.894 --> 24:40.817
<i>Calling all psychopaths!</i>

24:40.896 --> 24:42.614
<i>Are you mental or deranged?</i>

24:42.690 --> 24:45.113
<i>Maybe you've recently
been hospitalized,</i>

24:45.192 --> 24:46.739
<i>but are now okay.</i>

24:46.819 --> 24:49.413
<i>Or maybe the world
just doesn't understand you.</i>

24:49.488 --> 24:50.831
<i>Yeah, right!</i>

24:50.906 --> 24:54.627
<i>Well, I'm writing a screenplay with my
friend called the Seven Psychopaths,</i>

24:54.702 --> 24:59.378
<i>and if your story is crazy or quirky
enough, we might use it for our movie.</i>

24:59.456 --> 25:02.255
<i>So please call Billy
Bickie at 310-555-01...</i>

25:04.294 --> 25:06.217
Fucking asshole dog-fucker.

25:06.547 --> 25:08.845
Really? That's nice.

25:09.258 --> 25:10.885
No, no, thank you.
Are you sure?

25:10.968 --> 25:12.015
Please, really.

25:12.094 --> 25:13.141
Thank you.

25:32.322 --> 25:34.120
All right, old man, get in the car.
Whoa!

25:34.199 --> 25:35.542
Get in the car.
Come on.

25:35.617 --> 25:37.745
What? "What?"
Get in the car, man.

25:37.828 --> 25:40.627
Don't make me repeat
myself, dog fucker.

25:43.751 --> 25:45.924
<i>Where do you keep the dogs?</i>

25:46.128 --> 25:48.301
What dogs?

25:48.505 --> 25:50.724
To repeat,
where do you keep the dogs?

25:50.799 --> 25:52.142
1228 Bayside.

25:53.552 --> 25:55.020
Who are you?

25:56.305 --> 25:57.352
I'm Billy's friend.

25:57.431 --> 25:59.272
Well, just keep out of
our way, Billy's friend.

25:59.308 --> 26:00.434
Al, check the cages.

26:04.730 --> 26:06.448
He ain't here! Where
is he, old man?

26:06.523 --> 26:08.651
Little shih tzu, name of Bonny.

26:08.776 --> 26:11.871
Shih tzu? We ain't never
had a shih tzu in here.

26:13.280 --> 26:15.658
You don't listen too good the
first time, do you, old man?

26:15.824 --> 26:17.326
Tell me where Bonny is,
or else this guy gets it!

26:17.701 --> 26:19.169
On.

26:19.286 --> 26:21.709
I don't even know this guy.
What the hell do I care?

26:21.789 --> 26:23.837
I know where the shih tzu is.
I know where the shih tzu is.

26:23.916 --> 26:24.917
Where is he?

26:25.000 --> 26:28.925
Kid, I don't know who you
are or why you're here,

26:29.171 --> 26:32.300
and I don't know if you do
know where this shih tzu is

26:32.382 --> 26:34.134
or if you don't know
where this shih tzu is,

26:34.218 --> 26:37.939
but either way have
some pride in yourself.

26:38.013 --> 26:40.983
Have some faith in
Jesus Christ as your Lord,

26:41.058 --> 26:44.312
and don't tell these scum-sucking
motherfuckers nothing.

26:44.853 --> 26:47.402
Don't! Don't, I'll tell you!
I'll tell you!

27:07.292 --> 27:09.090
Billy! Billy! Billy.

27:09.169 --> 27:10.887
Holy fuck!
What the hell happened?

27:10.963 --> 27:12.180
Some punks jumped us.

27:12.422 --> 27:14.470
Said they were looking
for a little shih tzu.

27:14.550 --> 27:16.552
Then some other punk
killed those punks.

27:16.635 --> 27:19.434
I've only been gone 10 fucking minutes.
Marty, are you okay?

27:19.555 --> 27:20.807
You looked fucked.

27:20.889 --> 27:22.311
I just didn't need this today.

27:22.391 --> 27:25.895
He's okay. It's their blood.
It's his puke.

27:26.228 --> 27:27.445
You wanna go to the bathroom,

27:27.563 --> 27:30.567
- clean some of the blood and the puke off you?
- Yeah.

27:32.192 --> 27:35.412
Marty's my writer friend
I was telling you about.

27:35.487 --> 27:37.455
I could smell the booze.

27:39.908 --> 27:42.957
Where did you get this
little shih tzu, Billy? Huh?

27:43.537 --> 27:47.087
I got her off some fat black
chick down at The Elephants.

27:47.875 --> 27:50.754
You think she's the one
that they're after?

27:51.128 --> 27:54.052
I think there's a strong
possibility, Billy.

27:56.758 --> 27:58.351
So are we gonna
give him his dog back?

27:58.427 --> 27:59.768
That jerk's forfeited all right

27:59.769 --> 28:02.355
to having a nice dog like this.
Mmm-hmm.

28:02.806 --> 28:03.932
Miss?

28:05.267 --> 28:07.520
Well, what are we gonna do?

28:08.562 --> 28:11.862
I think we should try and find
this Jack O' Diamonds guy

28:11.940 --> 28:14.489
and get him to
join forces with us.

28:14.610 --> 28:18.160
And then we could take on all the
bad guys, like maybe in the desert.

28:19.865 --> 28:22.118
And what do you think
we should do in real life?

28:22.242 --> 28:25.337
Well, we could sober up, Marty.
How's that grab you?

28:27.414 --> 28:28.711
I think we should
go to the cops.

28:28.790 --> 28:31.088
Fuck the cops!
Fuck them!

28:31.251 --> 28:33.219
Fuck them. All right.
Jesus Christ.

28:33.295 --> 28:35.297
There are some
nice cops, aren't there?

28:35.756 --> 28:36.882
He's from Ireland.

28:36.965 --> 28:38.308
I'm gonna head to the hospital.

28:38.383 --> 28:41.478
I said I'd be with Myra
when her results come in.

28:41.553 --> 28:43.146
No fucking cops.

28:47.059 --> 28:48.311
No cops.

28:49.978 --> 28:51.946
Who's Myra?
His wife.

28:52.814 --> 28:55.408
She's just had
surgery for cancer.

28:55.484 --> 28:57.157
And you think
you've got problems.

28:59.821 --> 29:01.744
He ain't here,
and now we don't know

29:01.823 --> 29:04.872
where this guy is or what
the hell he looks like.

29:04.952 --> 29:07.922
Yeah, can we get Dennis
to a hospital now, Charlie?

29:07.996 --> 29:09.964
Yeah, let's get him
to a hospital.

29:10.040 --> 29:12.418
And let's get on to the ASPCA

29:12.501 --> 29:15.550
and have 'em take care
of these poor bastards.

29:15.629 --> 29:18.678
Maybe we should go to the
hospital with him, Charlie.

29:18.799 --> 29:21.302
You know I don't
like hospitals.

29:21.385 --> 29:24.138
Yeah, but it's where
the guy's wife is.

29:32.896 --> 29:34.614
You know, Marty, the way
you're feeling today,

29:34.690 --> 29:36.363
all depressed and
alcoholic and shit?

29:36.441 --> 29:38.864
You know what you should do?
Put it into your writing, man.

29:38.944 --> 29:40.446
Use it. Mad idea?

29:40.529 --> 29:41.997
Thanks, Billy,
that's what I'll do.

29:42.072 --> 29:44.200
I'll put the way I'm feeling
today into my writing.

29:44.283 --> 29:46.206
And then I'll go blow
my fucking brains out.

29:46.285 --> 29:47.332
Come on, man.

29:47.411 --> 29:49.539
You know your writing
helps alleviate

29:49.621 --> 29:51.339
your suicidal
self-loathing and shit.

29:51.415 --> 29:54.259
I don't have suicidal
self-loathing and shit.

29:54.334 --> 29:55.711
Yeah, right.
Hey, who's this chump?

30:01.341 --> 30:04.891
Hey, are you waiting
for somebody, old guy?

30:06.096 --> 30:07.564
Are you Billy Bickie?

30:07.639 --> 30:08.640
Uh...

30:08.724 --> 30:09.771
No.

30:10.100 --> 30:12.148
Well, my name
is Zachariah Rigby.

30:12.227 --> 30:15.276
I left a message
on Billy's telephone

30:15.355 --> 30:17.278
in answer to the advertisement.

30:17.357 --> 30:18.324
For fuck's sake!

30:18.400 --> 30:19.521
Well, I tell you, Zachariah.

30:19.568 --> 30:22.037
If you sounded like a nut,
I probably just deleted you.

30:22.863 --> 30:25.241
I don't think
I sounded like a nut.

30:25.324 --> 30:27.998
Were you screaming about
eating my heart off a tray

30:28.076 --> 30:29.623
and then shitting on it?

30:29.703 --> 30:32.126
No. No, I wouldn't do that.

30:36.001 --> 30:38.299
Okay, you seem normal.
Come on in.

30:38.378 --> 30:39.675
We gotta get this
dog off the street

30:39.755 --> 30:41.757
because it's kidnapped
from a maniac.

30:41.840 --> 30:43.012
Dandy.

30:51.475 --> 30:54.399
Testing, one-two.
Testing. Okay.

30:55.020 --> 30:58.194
Zach, unfortunately I gotta go play
tennis with my girlfriend now,

30:58.273 --> 30:59.820
but it's Marty who'll be
doing the writing anyway.

30:59.900 --> 31:01.447
You ain't leaving me
with this nut, Billy.

31:01.526 --> 31:03.699
And you ain't got a girlfriend.
He ain't got a girlfriend.

31:03.779 --> 31:04.780
Tennis?

31:04.863 --> 31:07.867
But it's voice-activated, so just
start telling your kooky stuff, Zach,

31:07.949 --> 31:10.168
and see you guys soon, okay?

31:16.625 --> 31:18.127
Zach?
Yeah.

31:19.503 --> 31:22.383
All right, listen. Why don't you just
tell me whatever you wanna tell me,

31:22.464 --> 31:24.967
and I'll go make us a coffee.
How about that?

31:25.175 --> 31:26.427
Tea.
Huh?

31:26.802 --> 31:27.803
Tea.

31:28.011 --> 31:29.638
Tea? Why not?

31:33.558 --> 31:36.402
Well, I guess

31:38.688 --> 31:40.816
it all began
back when I was 17.

31:40.982 --> 31:42.234
I...

31:43.860 --> 31:46.113
The distant mists of time.

31:49.074 --> 31:53.500
I was a little wet behind the ears back then.
I don't mind admitting it.

31:54.037 --> 31:59.669
I was burglarizing the house of
this judge down in Delacroix.

32:01.253 --> 32:03.847
Let me tell you something,
don't never burglarize

32:03.922 --> 32:06.846
the house of no judge
down in Delacroix.

32:07.300 --> 32:10.349
Because when I went down
into his basement,

32:11.721 --> 32:14.144
you know what
I found down there?

32:14.433 --> 32:17.983
I found the corpses of
two negro girls down there.

32:18.395 --> 32:21.774
And then I found a half-alive
'nother negro girl

32:22.232 --> 32:24.451
chained right along with them.

32:27.612 --> 32:28.864
Well,

32:31.074 --> 32:34.248
the girl's name was Maggie.

32:36.538 --> 32:39.587
She told me all about the judge

32:39.666 --> 32:42.510
and she told me what
a terrible man he was,

32:42.586 --> 32:47.342
and I think I fell in love with
Maggie right then and there.

32:49.050 --> 32:51.894
And I think she did
a little with me, too.

32:52.971 --> 32:55.941
Then the judge came home.

32:58.018 --> 33:01.113
Yeah, and he was awful angry.

33:03.398 --> 33:05.571
We just didn't know what to do.

33:05.650 --> 33:06.697
And what did you do?

33:06.776 --> 33:11.407
Well, we hung him from his
neck until he was dead,

33:13.325 --> 33:18.081
and that's when Maggie and
me got this idea, see?

33:19.623 --> 33:20.749
What idea?

33:20.832 --> 33:24.177
Well, the idea that we'd go
around the country killing people

33:24.252 --> 33:27.096
who go around the
country killing people.

33:27.589 --> 33:30.763
Like serial killer killing.

33:31.468 --> 33:34.312
I guess that's what
you'd call it nowadays.

33:34.387 --> 33:35.604
Uh-huh.

34:56.344 --> 34:57.971
Get in the house.

34:58.096 --> 34:59.689
Get in the house!

35:17.032 --> 35:18.204
Maggie!

36:27.227 --> 36:30.481
<i>1975 it was,
she burned that hippie.</i>

36:34.943 --> 36:37.787
<i>I've been looking
for her ever since.</i>

36:42.867 --> 36:46.167
There is something I'd like
you to do for me, Martin.

36:46.621 --> 36:49.295
When you use
my story in your movie,

36:51.626 --> 36:54.505
I'd like you to put a little
message up there at the end.

36:55.255 --> 36:57.974
I want you to tell
her that I miss her.

36:59.050 --> 37:00.597
And I love her.

37:01.594 --> 37:04.598
And I should have helped
her kill that hippie.

37:06.099 --> 37:07.646
And I'm sorry.

37:08.685 --> 37:10.062
And to call.

37:11.646 --> 37:14.490
You think you could
do that for me, Martin?

37:14.983 --> 37:16.826
I'd be glad to, Zach.

37:17.152 --> 37:18.369
Promise?

37:19.320 --> 37:21.072
I promise on my life.

37:21.156 --> 37:22.624
Wow.

37:25.660 --> 37:27.503
That's a big promise.

38:12.040 --> 38:13.542
Can I help you?
Oh.

38:13.625 --> 38:15.423
Uh... Yeah.

38:16.127 --> 38:19.882
I'm looking for a Polish lady.

38:20.089 --> 38:23.889
A Mrs. Kieslowski.

38:26.137 --> 38:28.231
She's having an operation.

38:34.103 --> 38:36.231
How long's that gonna take?

38:37.148 --> 38:38.616
I don't know.

38:44.405 --> 38:47.249
What do you want
Mrs. Kieslowski for?

38:49.285 --> 38:52.129
Her husband's got
something belongs to me.

38:55.834 --> 38:56.835
Oh.

38:58.795 --> 39:01.139
You gonna shoot her?

39:01.256 --> 39:03.350
No. No, "shoot her"?

39:03.424 --> 39:08.646
No, no, I'm just gonna
scare her so she tells me

39:09.639 --> 39:14.361
where her husband's at
and where my dog's at.

39:17.188 --> 39:19.441
And what if she don't know?

39:19.691 --> 39:21.910
Well, then I'm gonna get mad.

39:31.327 --> 39:33.375
Can I go use the bathroom?

39:36.374 --> 39:39.378
I think you'd better wait
around here for a while.

39:39.460 --> 39:42.839
Maybe do it in
a pan or something.

39:43.798 --> 39:45.141
I can wait.

39:45.925 --> 39:47.677
I don't use no pans.

39:49.304 --> 39:50.806
Suit yourself.

40:15.663 --> 40:17.210
What's your dog's name?

40:18.333 --> 40:19.550
Bonny.

40:20.126 --> 40:21.844
That's a nice name.

40:25.173 --> 40:28.894
I'm sure Mr. Kieslowski will
take good care of your dog

40:28.968 --> 40:31.096
and get it back to you safe.

40:32.639 --> 40:36.143
He always seems like a sweet
man when he comes in.

40:45.443 --> 40:47.161
He come visit her a lot?

40:48.529 --> 40:49.872
Every day.

40:51.282 --> 40:53.410
What kind of times every day?

40:54.786 --> 40:55.787
Oh.

40:56.204 --> 40:58.206
Different times, you know.

40:58.498 --> 41:01.752
And not every day. He
misses a day now and then.

41:04.128 --> 41:05.380
Oh, yeah?

41:20.812 --> 41:22.439
He been in today?

41:24.023 --> 41:25.115
Yeah.

41:26.401 --> 41:27.448
Uh...

41:27.527 --> 41:31.577
He came in earlier this
morning, about 10:00 or so.

41:36.494 --> 41:39.043
So the Polack
married a nigger, huh?

41:44.460 --> 41:45.586
Yeah.

41:47.005 --> 41:49.804
The Polack married a nigger.

41:53.970 --> 41:55.643
Where is he now?

41:55.722 --> 41:57.190
I don't know.

42:00.435 --> 42:01.732
Where's my dog?

42:04.147 --> 42:06.275
You figure it out,
dumb-ass.

42:12.613 --> 42:14.615
Goodbye, Mrs. Kieslowski.

42:16.367 --> 42:17.869
Goodbye, Hans.

42:30.798 --> 42:32.641
We should get out of here.
I ain't leaving.

42:32.759 --> 42:35.353
I'm gonna wait down there till
that dog-thief motherfucker

42:35.428 --> 42:37.726
comes in screaming.

43:47.834 --> 43:49.211
You looking at something?

43:51.712 --> 43:53.885
No. Nothing at all.

43:58.511 --> 43:59.558
Are you hurt?

44:01.472 --> 44:02.724
A little.

44:09.939 --> 44:11.361
What's that?

44:13.943 --> 44:15.240
A cravat.

44:19.574 --> 44:21.542
It's nice. It's very...

44:23.077 --> 44:24.829
Of a bygone era.

44:33.588 --> 44:34.965
You have it.

44:36.090 --> 44:37.683
No, really.

44:38.092 --> 44:39.264
Please.

44:40.094 --> 44:42.062
I want you to have it.

44:43.097 --> 44:44.144
Have it.

44:47.101 --> 44:49.320
I don't want your cravat, man.

45:19.467 --> 45:21.014
What's wrong, honey?

45:21.093 --> 45:23.187
I don't think
I can keep it up, Ang.

45:24.680 --> 45:25.806
Nope.

45:26.933 --> 45:29.186
Look at that
limp piece of shit.

45:29.560 --> 45:31.233
Jeez, I hate these
frigging condoms.

45:31.312 --> 45:32.859
Then take it off,
baby, I trust you.

45:32.980 --> 45:36.826
You trust me? But you're still
screwing that Mafia guy.

45:36.943 --> 45:38.991
God knows what shit
that prick's given you.

45:39.946 --> 45:41.994
Get the fuck off me, Billy.

45:44.825 --> 45:47.578
I didn't mean AIDS
or nothing, honey.

45:47.745 --> 45:50.749
Honey, I meant like
chlamydia or something.

45:56.170 --> 45:58.423
Honey, I meant like
chlamydia or something.

45:58.506 --> 45:59.883
Three weeks I haven't seen you,

45:59.966 --> 46:01.343
and that's the way
you talk to me?

46:01.425 --> 46:03.143
I've been busy, baby.

46:03.219 --> 46:06.314
I've been busy trying to help
you out, if you must know.

46:06.389 --> 46:08.062
What are you talking about?

46:08.140 --> 46:12.190
Well, you know you said your
asshole boyfriend loves his dog

46:12.979 --> 46:15.073
more than anything
in the world, right?

46:17.525 --> 46:18.617
You haven't?

46:18.693 --> 46:19.740
I have!

46:19.860 --> 46:21.658
Billy! Billy,
you've gotta give it back.

46:21.737 --> 46:24.581
Give it back? I ain't gonna give
back shit, let alone my shih tzu.

46:24.657 --> 46:27.581
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God!

46:28.327 --> 46:29.294
Oh.

46:29.370 --> 46:31.418
"Give it back." It's kidnapped.
Oh, my God!

46:32.581 --> 46:36.211
It's a kidnapped dog. You don't
just give back a kidnapped dog.

46:36.294 --> 46:38.388
Defeats the entire
object of the kidnapping.

46:39.046 --> 46:41.048
They didn't just give
Patty Hearst back, did they?

46:41.132 --> 46:43.555
No, this dog
is my Patty Hearst.

46:43.634 --> 46:45.978
Except I ain't gonna keep it in a
closet and make it rob a bank.

46:46.053 --> 46:49.557
No, I'm gonna hold on to it
until your asshole boyfriend

46:50.224 --> 46:52.818
starts behaving like a decent human
being and gives me a bunch of money.

46:52.893 --> 46:54.190
The guy's a psychopath, Billy!

46:54.270 --> 46:56.147
Well, did you ever ask yourself

46:56.230 --> 46:59.029
what you're doing screwing a
psychopath in the first place?

46:59.108 --> 47:01.702
Screwing two psychopaths
is what the question is.

47:01.986 --> 47:05.035
What? Who's the second?
Oh. Who, me?

47:06.657 --> 47:08.625
I'm gonna call him,
clear this entire thing up.

47:08.701 --> 47:10.999
- No, you ain't either.
- Shit.

47:11.078 --> 47:12.921
Hello?
Charlie?

47:13.039 --> 47:14.916
Charlie...
Hi, Hans. Angela?

47:14.999 --> 47:17.093
How are you?
We were a little worried,

47:17.168 --> 47:18.715
you were late home is all.

47:18.836 --> 47:22.010
Yeah, I know. I just got
held up at the library.

47:22.923 --> 47:24.846
Hey, did Myra get
her results back?

47:24.925 --> 47:27.769
The results came in.
She got the all-clear.

47:27.845 --> 47:29.688
<i>Oh, my God, Hans,</i>

47:29.764 --> 47:31.437
I'm so happy for you.

47:31.599 --> 47:34.728
<i>Well, no, that gangster guy
whose dog we got,</i>

47:34.810 --> 47:37.108
<i>he come down and he killed her.</i>

47:38.856 --> 47:40.233
He what?

47:41.817 --> 47:45.447
I guess he must have found
out the connection somehow.

47:46.197 --> 47:49.292
He came down, he shot her in the
head in the hospital there,

47:49.408 --> 47:52.833
so she's dead now,
unfortunately.

47:57.333 --> 47:59.461
I'll be home in 20 minutes.

48:03.964 --> 48:05.181
Charlie, I know,

48:05.257 --> 48:06.930
I know we've been going
through some tough times,

48:07.009 --> 48:10.138
but it's all gonna work
out fine, I promise you.

48:27.029 --> 48:31.330
Hi. Can you send an ambulance
to 2618 Mountain Drive?

48:35.329 --> 48:37.707
Gunshot wound to the stomach.

48:46.632 --> 48:49.681
So don't say I never
do nothing for you. Okay?

49:30.718 --> 49:32.345
<i>Monday the 14th.</i>

49:32.678 --> 49:36.558
<i>Sat watching the shadow of the
neighbor's flagpole across my lawn again</i>

49:36.640 --> 49:39.644
<i>from 7:00 in the morning
to 7:00 in the evening.</i>

49:40.978 --> 49:42.571
<i>That's 11 hours.</i>

49:43.647 --> 49:46.651
<i>They've got a right to
fly a flag, don't they?</i>

49:46.734 --> 49:51.490
<i>Note to self, do not set
fire to the neighbor's flag.</i>

50:04.668 --> 50:07.888
<i>Work out more ways of being
a better friend to people.</i>

50:07.963 --> 50:10.261
<i>Kaya, for instance.
She is the girl Marty loves.</i>

50:10.424 --> 50:13.223
<i>Deep down,
she is possibly not a cunt.</i>

50:14.261 --> 50:17.435
<i>Marty. Do everything
to keep his mind</i>

50:17.515 --> 50:19.108
<i>on track about
the Seven Psychopaths.</i>

50:20.100 --> 50:24.105
<i>He is the best writer of his generation,
but he needs to stay focused.</i>

50:26.565 --> 50:30.286
<i>But do not bother him any more about
writing his screenplay with him.</i>

50:30.819 --> 50:33.663
<i>If he wants your help,
he will ask for it.</i>

50:40.412 --> 50:42.665
Hey, hey. Let's go,
let's go, let's go.

50:44.208 --> 50:45.300
Hans!

51:02.142 --> 51:03.743
<i>First thing you
gotta do, Charlie,</i>

51:03.811 --> 51:05.404
<i>you gotta pull
yourself together.</i>

51:05.729 --> 51:08.323
I gotta pull
myself together, I know.

51:10.234 --> 51:13.784
I have no idea
where my dog is now.

51:13.862 --> 51:16.615
Right, second thing,
we simply speak to Angela,

51:17.491 --> 51:20.370
see what else she knows about this
guy, where he might have got to.

51:21.662 --> 51:23.630
<i>What if she
don't know much more?</i>

51:24.206 --> 51:27.301
All right,
then we bide our time,

51:28.502 --> 51:30.425
wait until they
get in touch with us.

51:31.213 --> 51:34.057
Bonny ain't gonna be
no value to them dead.

51:34.174 --> 51:37.678
Don't say "Bonny" and "dead" in
the same thing, Paulo, please.

51:37.761 --> 51:39.684
I'm finding it
hard enough to cope.

51:39.763 --> 51:41.982
You're not pulling yourself
together, are you?

51:42.057 --> 51:43.479
I am, lam.

51:45.853 --> 51:48.026
My dog's gonna end up killed.

51:51.817 --> 51:53.569
There's something
else, Charlie.

51:55.863 --> 51:59.242
The guy's got about a hundred
packs of playing cards,

52:00.826 --> 52:03.545
and all the Jacks
of Diamonds are gone.

52:07.166 --> 52:09.635
The guy's a fucking psychopath.

52:13.881 --> 52:15.383
He's so calm.

52:15.633 --> 52:16.680
Hmm.

52:16.759 --> 52:20.935
Man, if I'd just had my wife
murdered, I think I'd be...

52:21.013 --> 52:22.606
Angry.
Yeah.

52:23.349 --> 52:26.728
That's Hans, man.
He's a proper Christian.

52:27.561 --> 52:30.735
You know, proper old-time Christian.
Not like these Fox News fucks.

52:33.400 --> 52:36.153
I feel bad, man. I kind of feel
like all this was my fault.

52:36.236 --> 52:38.204
I kidnapped
the guy's dog and all.

52:38.489 --> 52:42.414
Come on, Billy. How could you have
known it was that psycho's dog?

52:49.458 --> 52:51.756
<i>Do you wanna help me write
Seven Psychopaths, Billy?</i>

52:54.380 --> 52:55.757
Are you being serious?

52:57.091 --> 53:01.221
I thought I could
bounce some ideas off you,

53:01.303 --> 53:03.180
you could tinker
with some stuff.

53:03.931 --> 53:05.558
I would love that, Marty.

53:07.101 --> 53:08.899
I would really love that.

53:10.354 --> 53:13.198
I think I'm gonna quit drinking
till the movie's done.

53:14.566 --> 53:16.910
That, right there,
is a deal, man.

53:18.612 --> 53:20.910
It's not a deal, no.

53:20.989 --> 53:23.287
I'm just gonna stop drinking for a while.
There's no deal involved.

53:23.367 --> 53:25.369
That, right there, is

53:26.203 --> 53:28.626
not a deal.
Equally cool.

53:34.128 --> 53:35.755
But if we go there,
we're gonna get lost.

53:37.673 --> 53:38.970
You don't drink, Hans, no?

53:39.550 --> 53:42.474
I take peyote, sometimes.

53:42.553 --> 53:45.807
Billy has some peyote
I might take later.

53:55.649 --> 53:57.401
I'm sorry about
your wife, Hans.

54:00.946 --> 54:02.789
But I guess
she's in Heaven now.

54:04.783 --> 54:06.330
You believe in Heaven?

54:07.995 --> 54:10.464
I'm not sure what I
believe, you know.

54:10.539 --> 54:13.088
I put a lot of Heaven and
Hell stuff in my stories,

54:13.167 --> 54:14.885
but I'm not sure
what I believe.

54:18.130 --> 54:21.350
Why don't you tell me one of your
Heaven and Hell stories, Martin?

54:22.259 --> 54:25.229
Billy said he didn't
think you'd like it much.

54:25.304 --> 54:26.851
I like stories.

54:28.629 --> 54:29.721
Okay.

54:32.550 --> 54:34.518
This one is kind of
a Heaven and Hell story.

54:35.303 --> 54:36.350
Uh, well...

54:36.429 --> 54:40.059
It's more of a Hell story. It's
all about this Quaker psychopath.

54:41.100 --> 54:43.819
Out in the fields, one day,
he comes upon his daughter.

54:44.896 --> 54:46.739
She's been murdered brutally.

54:51.068 --> 54:54.322
...the only ones
guaranteed to go to Hell

54:54.405 --> 54:55.907
are those who die
by their own hand.

54:55.990 --> 54:57.663
Stop!
So he took out a...

54:57.742 --> 54:59.995
...cut-throat... Stop!
Stop, stop, stop.

55:00.077 --> 55:01.249
What?
Yeah, what?

55:01.579 --> 55:05.800
I just... I don't think
that's a very nice story.

55:06.501 --> 55:08.720
I wanna know what
happens at the end.

55:09.921 --> 55:11.173
Well...

55:11.506 --> 55:12.758
So...

55:13.883 --> 55:16.727
The killer took out a
cut-throat razor and as he

55:17.470 --> 55:22.351
cut his throat open, he whispered,
"Now are you happy, old man?"

55:22.433 --> 55:24.561
And the last thing that...
The killer ever saw...

55:24.977 --> 55:28.857
That the killer ever saw, yes, was the
old man take out a razor of his own,

55:30.149 --> 55:31.867
put it to his throat and...

55:35.446 --> 55:36.789
And slice.

55:46.624 --> 55:48.092
That's a very good story.

55:49.418 --> 55:52.797
Did you make that
up all by yourself?

56:03.474 --> 56:06.353
Some of the details aren't
exactly right, of course.

56:06.435 --> 56:10.861
I wouldn't necessarily call
myself a psychopath, you know,

56:11.023 --> 56:12.991
and I didn't go
to Hell, obviously.

56:13.693 --> 56:16.446
<i>I don't know if he did. Yet.</i>

56:20.199 --> 56:21.997
<i>Our beautiful
daughter was black.</i>

56:22.076 --> 56:23.498
<i>I don't think
you mentioned that.</i>

56:24.495 --> 56:27.795
<i>And I was not on my own the
whole time, following him.</i>

56:27.873 --> 56:30.672
<i>You know, you can't do that
kind of work all on your own.</i>

56:34.880 --> 56:38.225
But looking back on
what's been wasted...

56:39.510 --> 56:41.888
At the time, I thought
it had to be done.

56:43.014 --> 56:44.516
I'm not so sure any more.

56:45.600 --> 56:48.069
Course it had to be done.
He killed your kid.

56:48.185 --> 56:50.654
You had to fuck him over by any
means necessary.

56:50.938 --> 56:52.656
Well, as Gandhi said...

56:52.732 --> 56:55.952
Oh, you two. If it ain't
Gandhi, it's Jesus Christ.

56:56.027 --> 56:58.621
"An eye for an eye leaves
the whole world blind."

56:58.696 --> 57:00.243
I believe that wholeheartedly.

57:10.291 --> 57:14.717
No, it doesn't. There'll be
one guy left with one eye.

57:14.795 --> 57:17.639
How's the last blind guy
gonna take out the eye

57:17.715 --> 57:21.185
of the last guy left
who's still got one eye?

57:21.260 --> 57:25.811
All that guy has to do is run
away and hide behind a bush.

57:26.474 --> 57:27.942
Gandhi was wrong.

57:28.476 --> 57:31.776
It's just that nobody's got the
balls to come right out and say it.

57:32.980 --> 57:34.581
Hans, I'm trying to
write something about

57:34.607 --> 57:36.208
the kinds of things
you're talking about.

57:37.068 --> 57:41.073
Yeah. Would you like
to help write it with me?

57:41.280 --> 57:43.328
You said I could
help write it with you.

57:43.407 --> 57:44.927
Yeah, we can all
help write it with me.

57:45.618 --> 57:49.043
He doesn't even wanna help write it with you.
His wife just died.

57:49.121 --> 57:51.965
I don't mind helping, as long as
it isn't gonna be too violent.

57:52.124 --> 57:54.673
- Of course it's gonna be too violent.
- That's the whole point.

57:54.752 --> 57:57.847
I told you 20 times, Billy, I
don't want it to be violent.

57:58.673 --> 58:00.266
I want it to be
life-affirming.

58:00.383 --> 58:02.477
Life-affirming?
Schmife-affirming!

58:02.593 --> 58:05.267
It's about seven fucking
psychopaths! Hey!

58:07.056 --> 58:09.354
No, you know what I think
the movie should be?

58:11.310 --> 58:14.154
The first half should
be a perfect setup

58:14.230 --> 58:15.903
for an out-and-out
revenge flick.

58:15.981 --> 58:19.201
Yeah.
Violence. Guns.

58:19.527 --> 58:21.655
All the usual bullshit.
And then...

58:23.489 --> 58:25.082
I don't know, man, it's...

58:25.157 --> 58:28.001
The lead characters
should just walk away.

58:28.703 --> 58:32.424
They should just drive off into the
desert and pitch a tent somewhere

58:32.998 --> 58:35.717
and just talk for the rest of

58:37.545 --> 58:41.550
the frigging movie.
No shoot-outs, no payoffs.

58:41.632 --> 58:44.602
Just human beings talking.

58:45.177 --> 58:47.179
What, are we making
French movies now?

58:47.304 --> 58:50.308
That sounds like the stupidest ending.
No shoot-outs?

58:50.766 --> 58:52.939
That sounds like
the stupidest ending

58:53.018 --> 58:55.066
to a movie I've ever fucking...

58:55.146 --> 58:56.819
No shoot-outs?
Mmm-hmm.

59:01.026 --> 59:03.120
No?
No!

59:13.164 --> 59:14.336
Wow.

59:14.665 --> 59:18.169
Now if we were gonna have a shoot-out,
that'd be the perfect place.

59:18.252 --> 59:19.813
I know we're not
gonna have a shoot-out.

59:19.837 --> 59:21.714
I'm just saying if we were
gonna have a shoot-out.

59:21.797 --> 59:24.676
Jesus. Gandhi. Joseph.

59:56.332 --> 59:57.504
Hey, ho.

01:00:00.669 --> 01:00:03.422
Martin, I've been
reading your movie.

01:00:04.048 --> 01:00:05.049
Oh.

01:00:05.925 --> 01:00:07.393
What do you think?

01:00:07.510 --> 01:00:09.433
Your women
characters are awful.

01:00:11.013 --> 01:00:13.892
None of them have anything
to say for themselves.

01:00:13.974 --> 01:00:15.817
And most of them
get either shot

01:00:15.893 --> 01:00:17.816
or stabbed to death
within five minutes.

01:00:17.895 --> 01:00:20.614
And the ones that don't
probably will later on.

01:00:22.233 --> 01:00:23.405
Well...

01:00:24.610 --> 01:00:27.033
It's a hard world
for women. You know?

01:00:27.905 --> 01:00:29.657
And I guess that's
what I'm trying to say.

01:00:29.740 --> 01:00:31.959
Yeah, it's a hard world
for women,

01:00:32.034 --> 01:00:34.662
but most of the ones I know can
string a sentence together.

01:00:38.582 --> 01:00:40.255
Didn't you like anything in it?

01:00:40.376 --> 01:00:43.004
You know who I'm intrigued by?
Who's that?

01:00:43.087 --> 01:00:47.058
This Vietnamese guy with the hooker.
Is it like a dream sequence?

01:00:47.132 --> 01:00:49.260
No. The Vietnamese guy...

01:00:50.719 --> 01:00:53.268
I just know his story
ain't gonna end in nothing

01:00:54.265 --> 01:00:56.484
but carnage and horror and...

01:00:58.060 --> 01:00:59.403
So I didn't even
wanna write it.

01:01:00.729 --> 01:01:01.889
<i>He's not even a priest.</i>

01:01:01.939 --> 01:01:03.782
<i>I just like the image
of a Vietnamese guy</i>

01:01:03.858 --> 01:01:05.656
<i>in a priest's outfit
with a snub-nosed .44.</i>

01:01:07.236 --> 01:01:09.489
<i>Anyway, his story is...</i>

01:01:09.822 --> 01:01:12.371
<i>He was in the Vietcong
for many years.</i>

01:01:12.449 --> 01:01:16.374
<i>A brilliant warrior
but a sicko. A psycho.</i>

01:01:19.707 --> 01:01:23.052
<i>And when the war was ended, he
returned to his little farming village</i>

01:01:23.127 --> 01:01:26.597
<i>with all intentions of living a peaceful
life with his wife and daughters.</i>

01:01:26.672 --> 01:01:29.551
<i>But the little farming village
he came from was called</i>

01:01:29.633 --> 01:01:30.725
<i>My Lai.</i>

01:01:35.180 --> 01:01:37.308
<i>And his wife
wasn't there any more.</i>

01:01:37.683 --> 01:01:39.606
<i>And his daughters
weren't there any more.</i>

01:01:43.647 --> 01:01:46.400
<i>And he ventured to
the USA to track down</i>

01:01:46.483 --> 01:01:47.951
<i>all the members
of Charlie Company</i>

01:01:48.027 --> 01:01:50.826
<i>who raped and butchered
his whole entire family.</i>

01:01:53.449 --> 01:01:55.417
<i>You see where I'm going
with this, right?</i>

01:01:57.202 --> 01:02:00.797
<i>Well, he'd already slaughtered six of
them by the time he got to Phoenix,</i>

01:02:00.873 --> 01:02:02.625
<i>where some kind of convention
was about to be held</i>

01:02:02.708 --> 01:02:04.961
<i>on the rights and wrongs
of the Vietnam War.</i>

01:02:05.044 --> 01:02:06.637
<i>And he's got
a big bomb with him</i>

01:02:06.712 --> 01:02:07.838
<i>that he's gonna
strap to a hooker</i>

01:02:07.922 --> 01:02:09.845
<i>and send her into the
middle of this convention.</i>

01:02:10.257 --> 01:02:12.055
<i>So this is the night
that we meet him,</i>

01:02:12.134 --> 01:02:13.681
and the hooker's
there in her panties.

01:02:13.761 --> 01:02:16.139
And, like I said,
there's no way

01:02:16.221 --> 01:02:17.643
that story's ending but grimly.

01:02:18.307 --> 01:02:21.106
That's a great
fucking psychopath, Marty.

01:02:22.353 --> 01:02:27.029
Yeah. But it's not what I wanna
really be writing about any more.

01:02:32.363 --> 01:02:35.082
<i>New idea. How about we change the
title from the Seven Psychopaths</i>

01:02:35.157 --> 01:02:37.159
<i>to the Seven Lesbians
Who Are All Disabled</i>

01:02:37.242 --> 01:02:38.722
<i>And Have Overcome
All This Spazzy Shit</i>

01:02:38.786 --> 01:02:41.380
<i>And Are Really Nice To Everybody
And Two Of 'Em Are Black?</i>

01:02:41.455 --> 01:02:42.877
How about that?

01:03:15.906 --> 01:03:18.375
I'm out here in the wilderness

01:03:19.785 --> 01:03:21.913
trying to think
about some ideas.

01:03:22.454 --> 01:03:28.006
Anyway, the way
I picture your screenplay,

01:03:28.085 --> 01:03:32.340
especially with this Vietnamese guy
who, of course, I'm fascinated by.

01:03:37.302 --> 01:03:39.100
- Pressure. Pressure.
- Huh?

01:03:41.265 --> 01:03:42.812
I'm a little nervous.

01:03:43.600 --> 01:03:45.523
Okay, everybody comfortable?

01:03:46.937 --> 01:03:48.405
Cell phones off, right?

01:03:49.898 --> 01:03:51.115
Okay, here we go.

01:03:51.942 --> 01:03:53.239
Exterior.

01:03:53.819 --> 01:03:55.867
Cemetery. Night.

01:03:56.488 --> 01:03:58.786
The shoot-out. Yeah!

01:04:00.993 --> 01:04:03.416
<i>The Jack O' Diamonds
is waiting there with Bonny,</i>

01:04:03.495 --> 01:04:06.044
<i>and he's arranged to give him back
and have this whole thing end</i>

01:04:06.123 --> 01:04:08.592
<i>because all he really
wants is peace. You know,</i>

01:04:08.667 --> 01:04:11.546
<i>like Gandhi or Jesus
or that other guy.</i>

01:04:12.421 --> 01:04:14.719
<i>Anyway, he's waiting there
for the Mafia boss,</i>

01:04:14.798 --> 01:04:17.972
<i>who's agreed to show up alone and unarmed.
But, yeah, guess what?</i>

01:04:18.052 --> 01:04:20.430
<i>Wait, wait a minute.</i>

01:04:20.512 --> 01:04:22.480
Surely he knows that
the Mafia boss is a psycho?

01:04:22.556 --> 01:04:25.150
Why would he believe he'd
show up alone and unarmed?

01:04:25.642 --> 01:04:26.643
Hmm.

01:04:27.311 --> 01:04:28.483
You know?
Yeah.

01:04:34.985 --> 01:04:36.077
Exactly!

01:04:36.153 --> 01:04:39.123
<i>Maybe the Jack O' Diamonds was
expecting to get double-crossed</i>

01:04:39.198 --> 01:04:40.700
<i>because he just happens to have</i>

01:04:40.783 --> 01:04:42.706
<i>brought a couple
of friends along.</i>

01:04:43.869 --> 01:04:46.964
<i>Suddenly, from out
of every fucking grave</i>

01:04:47.039 --> 01:04:50.009
<i>burst the seven psychopaths,
a gun in every hand.</i>

01:04:51.877 --> 01:04:54.505
Flamethrower!
Who the fuck is that?

01:04:56.465 --> 01:04:59.969
It's the Vietcong guy.
He was hiding up a tree.

01:05:01.720 --> 01:05:02.721
You! You're there,

01:05:02.846 --> 01:05:05.007
<i>but you're just there to
observe, and that's all right.</i>

01:05:05.224 --> 01:05:07.943
<i>Nobody thinks you're a pussy.
But it's started raining now.</i>

01:05:09.311 --> 01:05:10.688
Lightning.

01:05:11.355 --> 01:05:15.576
And oh, no, look who's wandered
in like a fucking idiot.

01:05:15.692 --> 01:05:19.822
<i>It's Kaya. She's come to say
sorry to you, and she loves you,</i>

01:05:20.114 --> 01:05:22.958
<i>and that she didn't mean
to be such a fucking bitch.</i>

01:05:23.033 --> 01:05:26.207
<i>You scream out,
"Ka ya! Stay back!"</i>

01:05:26.995 --> 01:05:29.339
<i>Too late,
she's fucking mown down.</i>

01:05:29.790 --> 01:05:32.043
Fucking mown down!

01:05:36.630 --> 01:05:38.007
Her head almost comes off.

01:05:39.091 --> 01:05:40.468
Her head does come off.

01:05:40.551 --> 01:05:43.145
You scream out her name,
all sad, and she dies.

01:05:43.428 --> 01:05:48.104
"Kaya! Kaya!"

01:05:48.392 --> 01:05:53.068
You throw your notepad away. Art and
peace and all that shit can wait!

01:05:53.397 --> 01:05:55.445
<i>Now's the time
for men to be men!</i>

01:06:08.829 --> 01:06:11.628
<i>"Fuck you, you cunts!"</i>

01:06:14.042 --> 01:06:15.419
It's really emotional.

01:06:16.336 --> 01:06:17.679
And then... Hold on.

01:06:21.508 --> 01:06:22.725
Yeah...

01:06:23.468 --> 01:06:25.345
The black chick from
the serial killer killers.

01:06:25.429 --> 01:06:27.431
She fought good,
but she's the next to croak.

01:06:29.474 --> 01:06:31.522
<i>Zachariah dies, too.
He buys it.</i>

01:06:31.977 --> 01:06:34.355
<i>Dies in her arms.
And they die</i>

01:06:34.438 --> 01:06:36.532
<i>and they're old and mental,
and so much in love.</i>

01:06:37.107 --> 01:06:38.734
<i>You know, it's really sad.</i>

01:06:39.568 --> 01:06:41.445
<i>But his rabbit
gets away, though,</i>

01:06:41.528 --> 01:06:44.623
because you can't let the animals
die in a movie. Just the women.

01:06:45.365 --> 01:06:48.414
<i>Anyway, guns, guns, guns!
Blam, blam, blam.</i>

01:06:53.790 --> 01:06:56.088
The Vietcong gets hit.
Then he dies,

01:06:56.168 --> 01:06:59.138
and he never even had a fucking
name, and he's so good.

01:06:59.213 --> 01:07:01.432
With his dying move,
he throws his nunchakus

01:07:01.506 --> 01:07:02.786
and he kills two
of the bastards.

01:07:02.841 --> 01:07:04.559
Nunchakus are Japanese.

01:07:04.801 --> 01:07:07.054
So the only ones left are you

01:07:07.471 --> 01:07:08.973
<i>and Hans.</i>

01:07:19.483 --> 01:07:24.114
Peace is for queers.
And now you're gonna die.

01:07:24.196 --> 01:07:25.664
But the Jack O' Diamonds
isn't dead at all.

01:07:25.739 --> 01:07:28.993
He was just a bit injured and he had
a fucking crossbow up his sleeve.

01:07:35.249 --> 01:07:37.593
<i>That's not enough,
so he pulls out a shotgun.</i>

01:07:39.169 --> 01:07:40.421
<i>Goodbye.</i>

01:07:42.172 --> 01:07:45.267
<i>And as the Jack O' Diamonds dies
in their arms, he whispers,</i>

01:07:46.301 --> 01:07:50.351
<i>"We did good, we
did good, didn't we, Marty?"</i>

01:07:50.681 --> 01:07:52.149
And through your tears,
you say,

01:07:52.224 --> 01:07:53.864
"Ah, bejesus, Jack,

01:07:54.101 --> 01:07:56.524
we did more than good.
We did grand."

01:07:57.145 --> 01:08:01.275
Jack says, "All I ever
wanted was to be your friend."

01:08:01.358 --> 01:08:03.486
"Marty, I'm your friend
now, ain't I?"

01:08:03.568 --> 01:08:08.290
And you say, "Ah, bejesus, sure,
you're me best friend, Jack."

01:08:08.365 --> 01:08:10.038
"You're me best friend."

01:08:10.867 --> 01:08:12.995
And then
the Jack O' Diamonds dies.

01:08:13.578 --> 01:08:17.502
And as his soul leaves his body
to go dance with the angels,

01:08:17.582 --> 01:08:20.005
we pan up over
the blood-strewn cemetery

01:08:20.085 --> 01:08:22.712
<i>and off into the pretty
blue skies of dawn.</i>

01:08:22.796 --> 01:08:27.643
<i>Skies blue enough to suggest
that maybe there can be peace</i>

01:08:28.218 --> 01:08:31.973
one clay in this troubled
but beautiful world.

01:08:32.055 --> 01:08:36.526
Maybe there can be peace
because that would be good!

01:08:42.149 --> 01:08:43.274
That's the end?

01:08:44.109 --> 01:08:45.234
Yeah!

01:08:46.611 --> 01:08:47.658
Oh.

01:08:47.738 --> 01:08:49.740
So, opinions?

01:08:52.576 --> 01:08:53.792
Well...

01:08:54.745 --> 01:08:55.917
It's very...

01:08:58.247 --> 01:09:00.876
I like it.
You like it? Hey!

01:09:01.376 --> 01:09:02.468
All right.

01:09:02.544 --> 01:09:05.171
- It's got layers, you know.
- Layers?

01:09:05.255 --> 01:09:07.256
Like a pie. Like a cake.

01:09:07.758 --> 01:09:10.136
It's got...
It's got many layers.

01:09:10.886 --> 01:09:12.559
This is an important
demographic.

01:09:12.679 --> 01:09:13.850
Mmm-hmm.

01:09:14.180 --> 01:09:15.854
So, what do you think?

01:09:15.932 --> 01:09:18.185
I think it's very,
it's very, you know...

01:09:18.268 --> 01:09:21.442
Very... Moving. Moving. Moving.

01:09:21.520 --> 01:09:23.201
I was paying attention,
I'll tell you that.

01:09:24.441 --> 01:09:26.158
You were... Moving.

01:09:26.443 --> 01:09:27.990
It's impossible

01:09:28.111 --> 01:09:31.866
for someone's head to actually
explode, isn't it? When it gets shot.

01:09:32.366 --> 01:09:33.582
No, no, it's possible.

01:09:33.658 --> 01:09:37.287
If the person's head was made out
of explosives, it's possible.

01:09:38.037 --> 01:09:40.381
Yeah. I like that.

01:09:47.671 --> 01:09:48.798
Hans.

01:10:03.814 --> 01:10:05.657
<i>Billy's a psychopath, Hans.</i>

01:10:09.653 --> 01:10:12.577
I guess he's made it
into your movie, then?

01:10:25.168 --> 01:10:27.967
Hi, Hans.
Hi, Mart.

01:10:31.758 --> 01:10:33.385
Marty, is that
what I think it is?

01:10:34.010 --> 01:10:36.229
If you think it's a bottle
of bourbon, then yeah.

01:10:39.015 --> 01:10:40.267
Do you want some?

01:10:40.350 --> 01:10:41.772
- Wow.
- Wow?

01:10:42.269 --> 01:10:43.270
Wow.

01:10:43.353 --> 01:10:45.822
Hans. Are you not
gonna say something?

01:10:46.481 --> 01:10:47.949
Where's the peyote, Billy?

01:10:48.692 --> 01:10:51.036
Oh, are we gonna
have a peyote party?

01:10:51.319 --> 01:10:52.536
Why not?

01:11:05.292 --> 01:11:06.635
I think

01:11:06.918 --> 01:11:08.545
I'd have made a great Pope.

01:11:12.215 --> 01:11:13.808
I'd have been very lenient.

01:11:13.884 --> 01:11:15.727
You'd have made
an awesome Pope, Hans.

01:11:16.011 --> 01:11:17.012
Huh?

01:11:18.889 --> 01:11:20.106
Hans,

01:11:24.019 --> 01:11:26.488
isn't one of us gonna address
the elephant in the room?

01:11:27.647 --> 01:11:28.899
The what?

01:11:30.358 --> 01:11:35.364
Yeah, who's on the
fucking peyote around here, Marty?

01:11:43.997 --> 01:11:45.089
Paw.

01:11:48.251 --> 01:11:49.343
Paw.

01:11:50.378 --> 01:11:52.597
I'm sorry if I haven't been a
very good friend to you, Billy.

01:11:52.672 --> 01:11:53.764
Paw.

01:11:55.091 --> 01:11:57.772
You've been a good friend to me, Marty.
What are you talking about?

01:12:02.182 --> 01:12:03.855
Why did you kill
all those people?

01:12:07.145 --> 01:12:08.146
Huh?

01:12:10.232 --> 01:12:12.234
Why did you kill
all those people?

01:12:15.779 --> 01:12:17.873
Like I told you
at Kaya's party,

01:12:17.948 --> 01:12:20.028
I killed all those people
to spur you on a little bit

01:12:20.075 --> 01:12:21.873
and give you
something to write about

01:12:21.952 --> 01:12:23.795
and get you to finish
your screenplay.

01:12:25.914 --> 01:12:27.632
You told me...

01:12:28.166 --> 01:12:29.463
When?

01:12:40.303 --> 01:12:44.729
I can't believe you told me
about this at the party, man!

01:12:48.979 --> 01:12:51.778
Maybe I am an alcoholic if I could
forget something like that.

01:12:55.819 --> 01:12:57.492
Maybe I am an alcoholic.

01:13:02.450 --> 01:13:04.570
Okay, listen. I didn't tell
you about it at the party.

01:13:04.578 --> 01:13:08.082
I was just kidding about that
because you surprised me,

01:13:08.164 --> 01:13:10.087
and it would have been ridiculous
telling you at the party.

01:13:10.166 --> 01:13:11.918
You might have told somebody,
got me in trouble.

01:13:12.002 --> 01:13:14.255
Then why did you just tell
me that you told me?

01:13:14.379 --> 01:13:15.972
To make you think a little bit

01:13:16.047 --> 01:13:17.720
about your alcohol issues.
How about that?

01:13:17.799 --> 01:13:19.676
Billy, you kill women!

01:13:19.801 --> 01:13:22.805
I killed a woman.
Take it easy.

01:13:22.971 --> 01:13:24.348
You shot her
in the stomach, Billy.

01:13:24.973 --> 01:13:26.850
That's better than
the head, ain't it?

01:13:27.017 --> 01:13:28.143
Not really, no.

01:13:28.226 --> 01:13:29.899
I said I was sorry, didn't I?

01:13:29.978 --> 01:13:31.104
Yeah, well...

01:13:32.314 --> 01:13:34.612
I don't hang out with people
who kill women, Billy,

01:13:34.691 --> 01:13:37.160
and I certainly don't write
screenplays with them.

01:13:39.946 --> 01:13:41.539
What are you
talking about, Marty?

01:13:43.116 --> 01:13:45.118
You'd best pack
the tent up, Billy.

01:13:48.121 --> 01:13:49.247
It's over.

01:13:51.750 --> 01:13:53.093
It's over?

01:13:56.129 --> 01:13:57.472
Now what...

01:13:57.547 --> 01:14:00.551
Where's this other
fucking nutcase?

01:14:04.387 --> 01:14:05.479
Hans!

01:14:06.723 --> 01:14:07.815
Hans.

01:14:09.684 --> 01:14:11.561
Hans. We're leaving.

01:14:12.729 --> 01:14:18.236
My wife is sitting on a chair someplace.
Some gray place.

01:14:19.069 --> 01:14:21.868
I thought she'd be in Heaven,
but she's sitting on a chair

01:14:22.572 --> 01:14:24.415
with a bullet in her head.

01:14:24.491 --> 01:14:27.040
I thought they'd have cleaned
that kind of stuff up.

01:14:27.661 --> 01:14:28.833
Maybe you've just eaten

01:14:28.912 --> 01:14:30.960
too many hallucinogenic
cactuses tonight, Hans.

01:14:31.039 --> 01:14:33.792
Nothing to do with
the hallucinogens.

01:14:33.875 --> 01:14:35.001
But you've just seen Myra

01:14:35.085 --> 01:14:36.553
on a chair with a bullet
through her head.

01:14:36.628 --> 01:14:38.380
In some gray place.

01:14:39.047 --> 01:14:40.264
England?

01:14:40.715 --> 01:14:42.558
It seemed a lot
worse than that.

01:14:44.177 --> 01:14:45.269
Wow.

01:14:46.054 --> 01:14:48.523
Listen, Hans, what say we talk
about this on the drive home?

01:14:48.598 --> 01:14:50.692
I mean, we may find some
perfectly reasonable...

01:14:55.271 --> 01:14:56.443
Jesus.

01:14:56.648 --> 01:14:57.820
Billy.

01:14:59.317 --> 01:15:00.614
Billy?

01:15:12.247 --> 01:15:13.965
In the tent, dumbo.

01:15:14.207 --> 01:15:15.299
What?

01:15:15.625 --> 01:15:17.093
Now don't get mad.

01:15:20.922 --> 01:15:22.219
What the hell did you do?

01:15:23.174 --> 01:15:24.972
I set the car on fire.

01:15:25.802 --> 01:15:28.351
How the hell are we
supposed to get home?

01:15:28.430 --> 01:15:30.558
We're in the middle
of the fucking desert, Billy.

01:15:30.640 --> 01:15:32.483
Yeah, that's the least
of our worries.

01:15:36.938 --> 01:15:38.485
What else did you do?

01:15:38.565 --> 01:15:40.112
I'll give you a clue.

01:15:43.695 --> 01:15:45.072
Come on in.

01:15:45.363 --> 01:15:47.365
So, yeah, I just called
up old Charlie Costello

01:15:47.449 --> 01:15:49.543
and I told him where we were and
to come down and get his dog back

01:15:49.617 --> 01:15:52.497
and said if he had any trouble finding
us, just look for a Buick on fire.

01:15:52.537 --> 01:15:54.289
But I did tell him to
promise to come alone

01:15:54.372 --> 01:15:56.090
and unarmed,
and he said he would.

01:15:56.499 --> 01:15:58.752
And he'll be here in a couple
of hours, depending on traffic.

01:15:58.835 --> 01:16:01.304
Now, I've labeled
these guns for you,

01:16:01.379 --> 01:16:03.347
but you totally
don't have to use them.

01:16:03.840 --> 01:16:06.764
I won't think you're pussies,
but I'm gonna hang on to mine.

01:16:06.843 --> 01:16:08.123
I think we've
done enough of this

01:16:08.511 --> 01:16:10.388
"talking about peace in
the desert" type stuff.

01:16:10.472 --> 01:16:11.598
Don't you?

01:16:11.681 --> 01:16:13.729
I do. This movie ends my way.

01:16:18.646 --> 01:16:22.947
Well, that's just fucking great!
Oh, great!

01:16:24.527 --> 01:16:26.871
You know what that is?
Do you know what that is?

01:16:26.988 --> 01:16:29.787
Great? That's just
fucking great!

01:16:36.414 --> 01:16:38.382
How far is the walk
to the Welcome Center?

01:16:39.083 --> 01:16:40.300
We can't leave him.

01:16:42.462 --> 01:16:43.839
You ain't gonna fight.

01:16:43.922 --> 01:16:47.051
Of course I ain't gonna
fight, but I ain't gonna run.

01:16:47.467 --> 01:16:49.890
What are you gonna do, then?
I guess I'm gonna die.

01:16:50.929 --> 01:16:52.522
Friends don't make
their friends die, Hans.

01:16:52.597 --> 01:16:54.190
Psychopathic friends do.

01:16:55.350 --> 01:16:58.399
You're the one who thought
psychopaths were so interesting.

01:16:59.229 --> 01:17:02.403
They get kind of tiresome after
a while, don't you think?

01:17:18.581 --> 01:17:22.677
Is that a guinea pig? It's a gerbil, isn't it?
That's enormous.

01:17:22.752 --> 01:17:25.801
Hey, Marty, we just seen
some kind of giant gerbil.

01:17:25.880 --> 01:17:27.132
Oh.

01:17:29.884 --> 01:17:32.478
Marty, you alcoholic
fucking bastard.

01:17:33.721 --> 01:17:35.894
You might wanna
stop drinking, Martin,

01:17:35.974 --> 01:17:38.272
if this is the way
you're gonna behave.

01:17:39.185 --> 01:17:41.438
If this is the way I'm gonna...

01:17:41.521 --> 01:17:44.149
This guy just telephoned
a psycho-killer

01:17:44.232 --> 01:17:45.529
to come down
and psycho-kill us.

01:17:45.775 --> 01:17:48.278
And this guy's doubting a
lifelong belief in the afterlife

01:17:48.361 --> 01:17:50.784
because of a psychedelic
cactus he just ate.

01:17:51.114 --> 01:17:53.958
And you motherfuckers are telling
me to behave? Whoa! Whoa!

01:17:54.033 --> 01:17:55.785
Time out. What's all
this about doubting

01:17:55.869 --> 01:17:57.371
a lifelong belief
in the afterlife

01:17:57.453 --> 01:17:59.000
because of a psychedelic
cactus you just ate?

01:17:59.080 --> 01:18:01.174
Hans, what the heck?
I met Myra.

01:18:02.250 --> 01:18:05.174
On the ridge.
She had some things to say.

01:18:06.504 --> 01:18:09.053
About the afterlife being
non-existent or something?

01:18:10.049 --> 01:18:11.266
That was the gist.

01:18:13.094 --> 01:18:15.813
No, no, it might
have sounded like Myra.

01:18:16.848 --> 01:18:18.316
But you know why?

01:18:19.601 --> 01:18:22.070
Now don't get mad, but you know

01:18:22.145 --> 01:18:24.318
I can do Myra's
voice pretty good.

01:18:25.315 --> 01:18:29.661
Yeah, I snuck up there a little while
ago and I pretended to be her.

01:18:30.320 --> 01:18:32.789
I started saying all
kinds of crazy stuff.

01:18:36.159 --> 01:18:38.833
But what specifically
did you say?

01:18:40.330 --> 01:18:42.082
About the place

01:18:42.999 --> 01:18:45.718
you were in.
The place Myra was in.

01:18:46.419 --> 01:18:47.420
Huh?

01:18:47.503 --> 01:18:50.302
How did you describe it,
specifically?

01:18:53.718 --> 01:18:55.345
You mean specifically?
Yeah.

01:18:56.179 --> 01:18:58.853
I just kind of said
it was all kind of...

01:19:03.102 --> 01:19:05.855
I just kind of said
it was all kind of

01:19:05.939 --> 01:19:07.316
gray and shit.

01:19:11.569 --> 01:19:12.616
No.

01:20:00.785 --> 01:20:03.254
Oh, great, now I have to kill
everybody all on my own.

01:20:06.582 --> 01:20:08.255
Sorry for hitting you
in the face so hard.

01:20:10.169 --> 01:20:13.890
That's all right. It was a pretty
good punch for a pacifist.

01:20:18.511 --> 01:20:19.854
I love you, man.

01:20:20.763 --> 01:20:22.265
I love you, too.

01:20:24.100 --> 01:20:28.025
Listen, if you're not gonna
be really doing any shooting,

01:20:28.104 --> 01:20:30.698
maybe you should just go with
Hans, see he gets back all right.

01:20:32.316 --> 01:20:33.363
Huh?

01:20:33.443 --> 01:20:37.118
I think I'll see how this plays out.
Sure I'm drunk now anyway.

01:20:38.865 --> 01:20:39.991
Yeah.

01:20:41.492 --> 01:20:45.122
Seriously, Marty, you gotta do
something about your drinking

01:20:45.455 --> 01:20:48.174
because, I swear to God, it's
gonna wind up killing you.

01:21:06.809 --> 01:21:08.732
This is kind of like
that window of time

01:21:08.811 --> 01:21:10.188
when you're waiting
in the waiting room

01:21:10.271 --> 01:21:12.069
of the VD clinic, isn't it?

01:21:12.523 --> 01:21:15.026
For the door to open and the
doctor to come out and say,

01:21:15.109 --> 01:21:16.986
"Billy, you're good to go."

01:21:18.613 --> 01:21:21.116
Or, "Billy, you've got VD."

01:21:27.997 --> 01:21:29.590
Or chlamydia or whatever.

01:21:38.341 --> 01:21:39.934
He's all alone.

01:21:41.385 --> 01:21:43.183
What the hell's
he all alone for?

01:22:06.202 --> 01:22:07.579
Turn around again.

01:22:12.542 --> 01:22:14.089
And lift up your jacket.

01:22:20.716 --> 01:22:21.808
You shot him in the back.

01:22:21.884 --> 01:22:22.885
Of course I shot
him in the back.

01:22:22.969 --> 01:22:24.437
I was going for his spine.

01:22:26.139 --> 01:22:27.641
But he was unarmed.

01:22:27.723 --> 01:22:29.976
My ass, he was fucking unarmed.

01:22:32.645 --> 01:22:34.318
Where's your guns?

01:22:34.397 --> 01:22:35.569
Where's your guns?

01:22:35.648 --> 01:22:36.740
You said don't bring none,

01:22:36.816 --> 01:22:38.489
so I didn't bring none.

01:22:38.568 --> 01:22:39.865
Hey, Bonny baby.

01:22:39.944 --> 01:22:44.040
You didn't bring a gun to the
final shoot-out? Bullshit.

01:22:44.115 --> 01:22:45.833
And don't talk to my dog!

01:22:45.908 --> 01:22:48.912
He said don't bring
none, so I didn't bring none.

01:22:49.453 --> 01:22:51.751
Who are you?
Just Billy's friend.

01:22:52.165 --> 01:22:53.712
Found it, motherfucker.

01:22:53.791 --> 01:22:55.759
Your friend's a fucking nut.

01:22:55.835 --> 01:23:00.261
My ass, you was fucking unarmed.
I found it, motherfucker.

01:23:00.715 --> 01:23:01.967
It's a flare gun, Billy.

01:23:02.049 --> 01:23:04.143
You could do a lot of
damage with a flare gun.

01:23:04.218 --> 01:23:05.845
Think I'm gonna die.
What?

01:23:05.970 --> 01:23:08.849
I think I'm gonna die. Well,
don't keep going on about it!

01:23:08.931 --> 01:23:11.184
You fucking cunt.

01:23:11.267 --> 01:23:12.644
Fucking ruined everything now.

01:23:14.270 --> 01:23:17.945
Will you let me give him a couple of
kisses and a couple of scratches?

01:23:18.024 --> 01:23:19.617
No, I ain't gonna
let you give him

01:23:19.692 --> 01:23:22.195
a couple of kisses and
a couple of scratches!

01:23:23.112 --> 01:23:24.614
Billy, we gotta get
him to a hospital.

01:23:25.907 --> 01:23:29.707
Are you out of your
alcoholic fucking mind?

01:23:29.911 --> 01:23:33.632
You don't take the chief fucking
villain to a fucking hospital.

01:24:16.958 --> 01:24:18.130
Put your hands up.

01:24:18.793 --> 01:24:19.840
No.

01:24:21.128 --> 01:24:23.005
What?
I said no.

01:24:24.298 --> 01:24:26.346
Why not?
I don't want to.

01:24:27.885 --> 01:24:29.728
But I've got a gun.
I don't care.

01:24:31.430 --> 01:24:32.647
But...

01:24:33.683 --> 01:24:35.026
it doesn't make any sense.

01:24:35.518 --> 01:24:36.770
Too bad.

01:24:40.356 --> 01:24:41.608
Well...

01:24:43.401 --> 01:24:44.573
Where are your friends?

01:24:44.652 --> 01:24:45.744
I don't know.

01:24:45.820 --> 01:24:48.289
Yes, you do know.
No, I don't know.

01:24:48.364 --> 01:24:49.365
You do know.

01:24:49.448 --> 01:24:50.449
Shoot me, then.

01:25:03.212 --> 01:25:04.213
<i>Fucking dick-bags.</i>

01:25:04.297 --> 01:25:06.641
This is just
un-fucking-believable, man.

01:25:07.758 --> 01:25:09.226
We can't just let
him bleed to death.

01:25:09.302 --> 01:25:10.474
We totally can.

01:25:10.553 --> 01:25:13.773
We totally can let him bleed to death.
That's totally what we can do.

01:25:13.848 --> 01:25:15.566
I'm not leaving without my dog.

01:25:15.933 --> 01:25:20.780
Listen up, you bald-headed fag.
It's you or your fucking dog!

01:25:21.022 --> 01:25:22.490
I gotta pick me, don't I?

01:25:22.565 --> 01:25:24.738
'Cause if I'm dead, I ain't
gonna have a dog anyway.

01:25:25.067 --> 01:25:26.785
That's very good.
That's very brainy.

01:25:26.861 --> 01:25:29.910
And if I'm alive, I can always
come back here and get my dog

01:25:29.989 --> 01:25:32.242
and blow your goddamn
head off, can't I?

01:25:32.408 --> 01:25:35.833
That's exactly right. With
your faggy little flare gun.

01:25:35.911 --> 01:25:37.208
You cunt.

01:25:37.580 --> 01:25:39.253
Can I have my flare gun back?

01:25:39.332 --> 01:25:40.959
No, you can't have
your flare gun back.

01:25:44.545 --> 01:25:46.422
What, is he drinking
and driving?

01:25:49.592 --> 01:25:50.969
I'll be back for you.

01:26:00.102 --> 01:26:03.606
That was the worst final
shoot-out I've ever fucking seen, man.

01:26:05.816 --> 01:26:10.117
Why would he only bring a
flare gun to the big final...

01:26:13.407 --> 01:26:16.035
on, I get it.

01:26:19.205 --> 01:26:20.707
Motherfucker.

01:26:35.471 --> 01:26:36.597
You got a gun?

01:26:48.442 --> 01:26:49.989
You don't got a gun,
do you, Quaker?

01:26:54.824 --> 01:26:58.203
You better keep out of the way now,
all right, old man? I like you.

01:26:58.953 --> 01:26:59.954
Hey.

01:27:04.625 --> 01:27:06.423
Stop! Police!

01:27:29.942 --> 01:27:31.535
It isn't gray

01:27:32.987 --> 01:27:34.284
at all.

01:27:52.631 --> 01:27:54.554
Shit!

01:27:58.804 --> 01:28:00.477
Should've brought
that gun along, buddy.

01:28:00.556 --> 01:28:01.603
Don't believe in them.

01:28:02.516 --> 01:28:05.065
In guns?
You don't believe in guns?

01:28:05.811 --> 01:28:07.563
They ain't fucking leprechauns,

01:28:07.646 --> 01:28:09.523
you dumb Mick. What are
you talking about?

01:28:09.899 --> 01:28:11.742
I was trying to
save your life, man.

01:28:13.152 --> 01:28:15.655
It's a flesh wound,
you fucking idiot.

01:28:16.197 --> 01:28:17.414
Give me my gun.

01:28:20.910 --> 01:28:22.207
Cops are coming, Charlie.

01:28:23.329 --> 01:28:25.081
We had to whack
that Quaker guy.

01:28:31.587 --> 01:28:33.260
Don't you wish
you had a gun now?

01:28:41.931 --> 01:28:42.978
No.

01:28:45.184 --> 01:28:46.436
I don't.

01:28:47.728 --> 01:28:49.651
So why don't you
go fuck yourself.

01:28:51.857 --> 01:28:53.609
Where's the other guy, Charlie?

01:28:57.988 --> 01:28:59.956
Down the road
a-ways with my dog.

01:29:01.158 --> 01:29:02.580
What are we gonna do?

01:29:10.125 --> 01:29:11.798
We're gonna go get my dog.

01:29:20.803 --> 01:29:23.556
What's with
your sour fucking puss?

01:29:23.639 --> 01:29:25.516
I could've just killed
you now, couldn't I?

01:29:26.642 --> 01:29:28.770
You've had your friend killed,

01:29:28.852 --> 01:29:30.445
and you're just about to have
your other friend killed,

01:29:30.521 --> 01:29:33.525
but that still only makes
two friends killed.

01:29:33.607 --> 01:29:37.737
I've had four of my guys killed,
and also my girlfriend killed,

01:29:37.820 --> 01:29:41.415
who I didn't like much, but
that's still five friends killed.

01:29:41.490 --> 01:29:43.584
That's three more
friends killed

01:29:43.659 --> 01:29:44.899
than you've had friends killed,

01:29:44.952 --> 01:29:48.502
so don't give me that moany
fucking face, okay?

01:30:00.593 --> 01:30:02.846
What? What do you see?

01:30:03.804 --> 01:30:07.354
Oh, nothing. Just the perfect
place for a final shoot-out.

01:30:39.798 --> 01:30:42.426
Get away from the car!
Get away from the car!

01:31:00.819 --> 01:31:04.414
Throw your guns down,
or the alcoholic gets it!

01:31:04.490 --> 01:31:05.992
Don't throw down shit, Billy!

01:31:06.075 --> 01:31:09.375
No, no. This is
working out perfect.

01:31:09.453 --> 01:31:11.126
Here's my guns, mister.

01:31:16.669 --> 01:31:18.091
And the other one!

01:31:18.170 --> 01:31:19.342
I only had two.

01:31:19.421 --> 01:31:21.298
Man, I saw you with three!

01:31:21.757 --> 01:31:25.011
All right, all right,
you're one smart cheese!

01:31:28.681 --> 01:31:31.309
Now get down here
with my fucking dog!

01:31:31.725 --> 01:31:33.272
Are you gonna let
Marty go if I do?

01:31:34.186 --> 01:31:36.609
Yes, I'm gonna let
Marty go if you do.

01:31:36.772 --> 01:31:38.945
He didn't have anything
to do with any of this.

01:31:39.608 --> 01:31:41.531
He was just writing a movie.

01:31:42.403 --> 01:31:43.746
Are you?
Yeah.

01:31:44.321 --> 01:31:45.493
What's it called?

01:31:45.572 --> 01:31:46.698
<i>Seven Psychopaths.</i>

01:31:51.412 --> 01:31:52.834
I'm coming down.

01:31:55.124 --> 01:31:57.843
I was just trying to buy

01:31:57.918 --> 01:32:01.639
some time because I had to

01:32:03.465 --> 01:32:05.513
reload something.

01:32:06.635 --> 01:32:08.808
Forgot about the flare
gun, you fucking idiot.

01:32:09.388 --> 01:32:10.810
Bonny.

01:32:10.889 --> 01:32:12.311
Yeah, Bonny, I know.

01:32:14.560 --> 01:32:16.187
And I like this dog.

01:32:16.854 --> 01:32:20.984
Please. Bonny's not part of the gang.
That's not fair.

01:32:21.483 --> 01:32:22.985
You gonna cry?

01:32:25.529 --> 01:32:26.826
Marty, get going.

01:32:28.490 --> 01:32:30.163
They killed Hans, Billy.

01:32:36.373 --> 01:32:37.875
Ah, man.

01:32:39.084 --> 01:32:41.507
I didn't kill him.
He killed him.

01:32:42.296 --> 01:32:43.673
Don't kill my dog.

01:32:44.339 --> 01:32:47.013
Marty, get going.
Write it up.

01:32:51.638 --> 01:32:53.515
Come with me,
Billy. Please.

01:32:55.017 --> 01:32:56.690
I told you, didn't I, Marty?

01:32:58.687 --> 01:32:59.859
Told me what, Billy?

01:33:00.439 --> 01:33:02.066
This movie ends my way.

01:33:08.030 --> 01:33:09.282
Oh, fuck.

01:33:26.715 --> 01:33:28.388
What's the matter
with your fucking gun?

01:33:29.009 --> 01:33:30.056
Gets jammed sometimes.

01:33:33.388 --> 01:33:35.061
At the fucking standoff?

01:33:35.390 --> 01:33:37.643
Paolo, shoot him.
At the fucking standoff?

01:33:37.726 --> 01:33:39.774
Paolo, shoot him
while he's not looking.

01:33:39.895 --> 01:33:42.523
- I am looking. Clearly, I'm looking.
- And I ain't shooting.

01:33:42.606 --> 01:33:44.734
What do you mean, you ain't shooting?
He's gonna shoot my dog.

01:33:44.817 --> 01:33:46.319
Yeah, well, fuck your dog.

01:33:47.236 --> 01:33:48.362
Fuck my dog?

01:33:48.445 --> 01:33:51.198
Hey, mongoloid,
fix your fucking gun,

01:33:51.740 --> 01:33:54.744
or your little gay dog's little
gay head's gonna fucking explode.

01:33:54.868 --> 01:33:56.996
He doesn't have a gay head.
Five.

01:33:57.246 --> 01:33:59.248
He has a normal head.
Four.

01:34:00.916 --> 01:34:03.465
Three. Can you go back to five?

01:34:03.710 --> 01:34:05.508
I ain't going
back to five, man.

01:34:06.421 --> 01:34:07.593
I ain't going back to five.

01:34:17.724 --> 01:34:18.816
Five.

01:34:21.144 --> 01:34:22.236
Four.

01:34:25.065 --> 01:34:26.237
Three.

01:34:28.443 --> 01:34:29.615
Two.

01:34:45.794 --> 01:34:47.717
Drop your gun!
Let me see your hands!

01:34:47.796 --> 01:34:49.218
Hands, move!

01:34:52.426 --> 01:34:54.724
Come here, baby.
Come to Daddy.

01:34:57.973 --> 01:34:59.065
Paw.

01:35:02.394 --> 01:35:03.486
Paw.

01:35:04.563 --> 01:35:05.655
Paw.

01:35:47.648 --> 01:35:49.195
He's my friend.

01:36:12.381 --> 01:36:13.974
<i>To Martin, I...</i>

01:36:14.758 --> 01:36:18.479
<i>Well, I ain't any kind of a
screenwriter as you know,</i>

01:36:18.553 --> 01:36:21.648
<i>but I've been kind of trying to
come up with some sort of solution</i>

01:36:21.723 --> 01:36:25.478
<i>to your Vietcong
psychopath conundrum</i>

01:36:25.560 --> 01:36:27.608
<i>and, goldarnit,
I think I may have found one.</i>

01:36:27.813 --> 01:36:29.907
So, there's this

01:36:31.566 --> 01:36:35.446
Vietnamese guy, and he's in
this hotel room in Phoenix,

01:36:35.570 --> 01:36:39.416
and he's sweating. He's sweating like hell.
He's burning up.

01:36:39.825 --> 01:36:44.080
<i>He takes out from his pocket a .44.
He checks it's loaded.</i>

01:36:45.288 --> 01:36:47.290
I don't know why
he checks it's loaded.

01:36:47.374 --> 01:36:49.877
Surely he's the one
who loaded it?

01:36:50.544 --> 01:36:55.550
Anyway, a hooker comes out of the
bathroom in a beautiful red dress.

01:36:55.757 --> 01:36:58.010
<i>She says, "Would you
like to make love,</i>

01:36:58.093 --> 01:37:02.439
<i>or should we have an intelligent
conversation instead?</i>

01:37:02.681 --> 01:37:06.311
<i>I've been reading a lot of Noam Chomsky
lately, I think he's a marvel."</i>

01:37:06.893 --> 01:37:10.773
The Vietnamese guy, you know, he
doesn't know what she's talking about.

01:37:11.815 --> 01:37:13.783
He's Vietnamese.
So, anyway,

01:37:14.067 --> 01:37:17.697
<i>you said you wanted some sex in it,
so I guess they're having sex.</i>

01:37:18.864 --> 01:37:20.332
Desist, brother.

01:37:20.782 --> 01:37:22.750
You know this will not help us.

01:37:27.289 --> 01:37:29.963
<i>He sniffs the air.
He says the single word...</i>

01:37:31.126 --> 01:37:32.173
Gasoline.

01:37:32.252 --> 01:37:34.175
<i>The hooker, she studied
Vietnamese at Yale.</i>

01:37:35.338 --> 01:37:37.181
I don't smell gas.

01:37:42.012 --> 01:37:43.309
You will.

01:37:44.306 --> 01:37:46.525
<i>He drags her to the place</i>

01:37:47.225 --> 01:37:49.227
<i>where the convention's
being held.</i>

01:37:49.686 --> 01:37:51.859
<i>She's got
the dynamite tied to her.</i>

01:37:51.938 --> 01:37:53.940
<i>He's got the gasoline
he's just bought.</i>

01:37:58.987 --> 01:38:01.911
<i>She backs away, petrified.</i>

01:38:01.990 --> 01:38:06.291
<i>He pours the gas out onto the floor.
It reaches her feet.</i>

01:38:06.495 --> 01:38:09.248
<i>A little of it has splashed over himself.
It doesn't matter.</i>

01:38:09.331 --> 01:38:13.507
<i>He takes out a match. In perfect
Vietnamese, the hooker whispers...</i>

01:38:14.669 --> 01:38:16.012
Desist, brother.

01:38:16.296 --> 01:38:18.344
You know this will not help us.

01:38:25.347 --> 01:38:29.477
He shuts his eyes.
Then he opens them again.

01:38:32.521 --> 01:38:34.649
<i>He ain't in Phoenix any more.</i>

01:38:35.357 --> 01:38:40.033
<i>He's sitting in the middle of
a street in Saigon circa 1963</i>

01:38:40.362 --> 01:38:44.242
<i>in the orange robes
of his Buddhist order,</i>

01:38:44.574 --> 01:38:47.248
<i>and he's drenched
himself in gasoline.</i>

01:38:50.205 --> 01:38:52.207
<i>As he finally manages to push</i>

01:38:52.290 --> 01:38:56.636
<i>the thoughts of anger and hate
out of his gentle mind,</i>

01:38:56.711 --> 01:38:59.214
<i>a fellow monk pleads
with him one final time.</i>

01:39:00.507 --> 01:39:02.555
Desist, brother.

01:39:02.634 --> 01:39:05.183
You know this will not help us.

01:39:05.554 --> 01:39:08.353
And all angry thoughts
finally dispelled.

01:39:12.310 --> 01:39:17.612
The first monk ever to burn himself
to death to protest the war whispers,

01:39:18.233 --> 01:39:19.485
"it might."

01:39:19.568 --> 01:39:20.740
It might.

01:39:21.486 --> 01:39:24.490
"It might."
And he lights the match.

01:39:31.246 --> 01:39:35.171
<i>So, you know,
your Vietcong psycho story</i>

01:39:35.250 --> 01:39:41.178
<i>becomes the final thoughts of a
man who chose not the darkness,</i>

01:39:41.256 --> 01:39:42.758
<i>but the light.</i>

01:39:43.341 --> 01:39:45.639
<i>The light being, you know,</i>

01:39:46.052 --> 01:39:49.056
<i>suicide by self-immolation.</i>

01:39:52.017 --> 01:39:56.113
But I think that's the best we're gonna get.
And, you know...

01:39:57.981 --> 01:39:59.358
I know you said

01:40:00.984 --> 01:40:05.911
dream sequences are for fags, but I
think it could work, don't you?

01:40:06.489 --> 01:40:08.366
We all gotta dream,

01:40:09.618 --> 01:40:11.086
don't we?

01:40:20.170 --> 01:40:21.638
Not just fags.

01:40:23.215 --> 01:40:27.516
Oh, by the way, I don't think they
like being called "fags" any more.

01:40:27.677 --> 01:40:31.807
I think nowadays
they prefer "homos."

01:42:02.897 --> 01:42:04.899
<i>- Hello?
- Is this Martin?</i>

01:42:05.400 --> 01:42:06.822
Yeah, who's this?

01:42:06.943 --> 01:42:08.411
<i>It's Zachariah Rigby.</i>

01:42:10.572 --> 01:42:15.499
<i>The guy you promised you'd put his
number up at the end of your movie.</i>

01:42:16.536 --> 01:42:21.087
Well, I went to see your movie yesterday.
Guess what?

01:42:21.416 --> 01:42:22.668
Shit.

01:42:22.751 --> 01:42:24.128
<i>Now how's she ever
gonna fucking find me?</i>

01:42:24.336 --> 01:42:25.713
<i>I didn't think you were...
Serious?</i>

01:42:26.713 --> 01:42:29.967
You didn't think I was serious just
because I carry a rabbit around?

01:42:30.050 --> 01:42:32.348
Listen, I'll get them
to change the credits.

01:42:32.427 --> 01:42:33.644
I'll get them to
put your number up.

01:42:33.720 --> 01:42:35.017
<i>No, no, no.</i>

01:42:37.640 --> 01:42:39.938
You're miles too late,
you know that, Martin.

01:42:41.186 --> 01:42:42.938
And you promised on your life.

01:42:44.773 --> 01:42:46.446
You know what that means,
don't you?

01:42:49.235 --> 01:42:52.239
<i>I said, "You know what
that means, don't you?"</i>

01:42:54.074 --> 01:42:56.293
I'm gonna be over
to kill you on Tuesday.

01:42:58.661 --> 01:43:00.083
That's good.

01:43:01.081 --> 01:43:02.628
I'm not doing anything Tuesday.

01:43:07.879 --> 01:43:09.301
You sound different.

01:43:12.634 --> 01:43:14.477
You sound like you've
been through a wringer.

01:43:17.430 --> 01:43:18.682
A little.

01:43:22.602 --> 01:43:24.821
I, well...

01:43:25.980 --> 01:43:27.732
Tuesday doesn't
really work for me.

01:43:29.609 --> 01:43:30.986
Can I get back to you?

01:43:34.239 --> 01:43:35.331
Sure.

01:43:37.367 --> 01:43:38.584
I'll be right here.

01:43:41.121 --> 01:43:42.338
I know.

01:43:52.549 --> 01:43:54.176
Come on, Carrie.

01:43:55.260 --> 01:43:56.682
Let's go home, baby.
