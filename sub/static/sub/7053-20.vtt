00:01.308 --> 00:02.975
<i>previously on fringe...</i>

00:03.043 --> 00:04.510
I crossed into another universe

00:04.578 --> 00:07.613
And took a son that wasn't mine.

00:07.680 --> 00:09.181
Not a day has passed
without me feeling

00:09.248 --> 00:11.616
The burden of that act.

00:11.684 --> 00:13.530
Peter deserves to know the
truth about who he is.

00:13.638 --> 00:14.876
You saved his life.

00:14.943 --> 00:16.511
I am sure that he
will understand.

00:16.579 --> 00:19.959
You didn't just open up a
hole to the other side.

00:20.026 --> 00:21.977
You brought me back. Son, this--

00:22.045 --> 00:25.545
I am not your son.

00:25.612 --> 00:27.884
Peter checked himself out of
the hospital three hours ago.

00:27.969 --> 00:29.820
<i>He's gone.</i>

01:23.116 --> 01:25.801
Walter?

01:27.916 --> 01:30.194
I've decided that we
need to get organized.

01:30.262 --> 01:32.441
You've been smoking marijuana.

01:32.514 --> 01:34.892
I'd hardly classify
what I've just smoked

01:34.960 --> 01:36.032
As marijuana.

01:36.099 --> 01:37.943
It's--it's a hybrid.

01:38.011 --> 01:43.644
Of chronic supernova
and afghani kush.

01:43.712 --> 01:46.828
I call it brown betty.

01:46.895 --> 01:49.306
Walter...

01:56.044 --> 01:58.420
I know how you're feeling.

01:58.488 --> 02:02.473
It's important to take
control of one's life.

02:02.541 --> 02:04.016
Walter. Eh.

02:04.084 --> 02:07.497
Peter is going to come back.

02:07.565 --> 02:10.377
He just needs some time.

02:10.446 --> 02:14.163
But he will come back.

02:18.819 --> 02:20.557
Oh! Hey.

02:20.624 --> 02:21.731
<i>Hey.</i>

02:21.799 --> 02:25.749
Is there news?
Have you found him?

02:25.816 --> 02:27.654
I'm sorry, walter.

02:27.721 --> 02:28.761
I have some leads
that I would like

02:28.829 --> 02:30.199
To follow up, but I have to--

02:30.267 --> 02:31.370
You have to what?

02:31.438 --> 02:33.279
What can be more important
than finding peter?

02:33.346 --> 02:34.583
<i>Aunt liv...</i>

02:34.651 --> 02:37.095
The snack machine stole
the dollar you gave me.

02:37.162 --> 02:40.407
Hi, astrid. Hi, uncle walter.

02:40.475 --> 02:42.448
Hi, ella. You know what?

02:42.516 --> 02:45.260
We have some snacks back
there in the fridge.

02:45.327 --> 02:46.497
You can go help yourself.

02:46.565 --> 02:49.241
Thanks. Mm-hmm.

02:49.309 --> 02:51.082
Who's that?

02:51.150 --> 02:53.457
<i>Ella, walter.
It smells funny in here.</i>

02:53.524 --> 02:54.761
Rachel's daughter.

02:54.831 --> 02:56.601
<i>Rachel's olivia's sister.</i>

02:56.669 --> 02:58.542
Rachel had to go to
chicago for the weekend,

02:58.609 --> 03:01.185
So she asked if I
could look after ella.

03:01.253 --> 03:02.959
And I was wondering if
maybe you could watch her--

03:03.027 --> 03:04.129
<i>Oh, no, no, no.</i>

03:04.197 --> 03:06.973
I couldn't possibly
look after anyone else.

03:07.041 --> 03:08.711
I'm well into phase one.

03:08.778 --> 03:11.287
I think she's talking about me.

03:11.355 --> 03:13.394
Walter just smoked something
called "brown betty."

03:13.462 --> 03:16.338
<i>Hi, cow. Be careful, stella.</i>

03:16.405 --> 03:20.384
Gene, gene, no licking.
No licking.

03:20.452 --> 03:22.424
You should only have to
watch her for a few hours.

03:22.492 --> 03:24.431
Don't worry, olivia.

03:24.499 --> 03:26.538
I will be here.
We would love to have her.

03:27.709 --> 03:28.844
<i>You're killing him.</i>

03:28.914 --> 03:30.717
You're not supposed
to touch the sides.

03:30.785 --> 03:32.959
<i>What kind of doctor are you?</i>

03:33.027 --> 03:34.966
<i>You're not even trying.</i>

03:35.033 --> 03:37.072
<i>His heart. All you've done</i>

03:37.140 --> 03:39.746
Is eat all my snacks and
talk about weird stuff.

03:39.813 --> 03:41.485
and everything makes you laugh.

03:41.553 --> 03:43.658
I know!

03:43.726 --> 03:45.397
Why don't you tell me a story?

03:45.465 --> 03:47.503
I'm not very good at stories.

03:47.571 --> 03:49.009
Didn't you used to
tell stories to peter?

03:49.077 --> 03:52.251
Mm.

03:52.319 --> 03:54.257
I'm sure mrs. Bishop did, but...

03:54.325 --> 03:58.936
No, I never told peter stories.

03:59.006 --> 04:03.212
I was always...
Too busy with my work.

04:03.279 --> 04:05.346
<i>What about your parents,</i>

04:05.414 --> 04:06.980
Uncle walter?

04:07.048 --> 04:08.214
Didn't they tell you stories?

04:08.282 --> 04:11.149
Oh, yes.

04:11.217 --> 04:15.385
My mother loved chandler

04:15.453 --> 04:18.187
And another writer
called dashiell hammett.

04:18.255 --> 04:21.490
She loved detective stories.

04:21.558 --> 04:23.958
Oh! And musicals!

04:24.026 --> 04:25.359
She adored musicals!

04:25.427 --> 04:28.562
She often would dress
me up to play parts

04:28.630 --> 04:29.997
In plays at school.

04:30.065 --> 04:33.299
I was roughed up quite
a lot as a child.

04:33.367 --> 04:34.867
<i>Walter...</i>

04:34.935 --> 04:35.935
I think that ella would

04:36.002 --> 04:36.969
Really, really enjoy a story.

04:37.037 --> 04:39.571
Once upon a time.

04:39.639 --> 04:42.073
Well, all right. Are you ready?

04:42.141 --> 04:44.409
<i>Um, hmm.</i>

04:44.476 --> 04:48.745
Once upon a time...

04:51.549 --> 04:56.252
There was an
accomplished detective.

04:56.319 --> 04:59.988
Except that she had
decided to retire,

05:00.056 --> 05:01.289
Pack it in,

05:01.357 --> 05:04.591
Because there was one
mystery she could not solve.

05:04.659 --> 05:06.393
what was that?

05:06.461 --> 05:08.495
how to mend a broken heart.

05:15.001 --> 05:15.934
<i>Miss dunham?</i>

05:16.002 --> 05:17.936
My name is rachel.

05:18.003 --> 05:19.704
I'm sorry to just
show up like this,

05:19.772 --> 05:21.205
But I have left you
several messages,

05:21.273 --> 05:23.040
And I'd like to hire you.

05:23.108 --> 05:25.943
<i>My boyfriend,
he's gone missing.</i>

05:26.011 --> 05:28.412
Well, as you can see,
I'm kinda busy.

05:28.480 --> 05:29.947
<i>He got in over his head
to a gambler.</i>

05:30.015 --> 05:31.248
<i>A guy named big eddie.</i>

05:31.316 --> 05:33.616
I'm afraid something bad
may have happened to him.

05:33.684 --> 05:36.416
Drown him? I'm sorry, what?

05:36.484 --> 05:40.386
Oh, uh, no, thank you.

05:40.454 --> 05:43.388
You know, most times when
someone comes in here

05:43.456 --> 05:46.491
Worried that their sweetheart's
gone missing, or worse...

05:46.558 --> 05:49.460
By the time they find out
what I usually find out,

05:49.527 --> 05:51.495
They wind up wishing
he really were dead.

05:51.562 --> 05:53.730
What do you usually find out?

05:53.798 --> 05:55.598
Rachel, is it?

05:55.666 --> 05:59.268
Do yourself a favor.

05:59.336 --> 06:00.870
Go home.

06:00.938 --> 06:03.739
<i>He wouldn't do what
you're suggesting.</i>

06:03.807 --> 06:07.343
We met only a few
weeks ago, but...

06:07.411 --> 06:10.680
It was love at first sight.

06:10.747 --> 06:12.782
You probably don't believe

06:12.850 --> 06:14.450
Something like that exists.

06:14.518 --> 06:17.654
But I assure you it does.

06:17.721 --> 06:22.592
* something happens and
I'm head over heels *

06:22.660 --> 06:28.329
* I never find out till
I'm head over heels *

06:28.397 --> 06:32.664
* something happens and
I'm head over heels *

06:32.698 --> 06:34.962
* don't take my heart,
don't break my heart *

06:35.030 --> 06:41.599
* don't, don't,
don't throw it away *

06:41.667 --> 06:45.069
What those school kids
must've done to you.

06:45.137 --> 06:47.338
Maybe you should
teach me algebra.

06:47.405 --> 06:48.472
Oh.

06:48.540 --> 06:52.109
Oh, you see, the... Medication

06:52.176 --> 06:55.078
<i>That uncle walter is on,
causes his</i>

06:55.146 --> 06:59.648
Posterior and lateral
cricoarytenoid muscles

06:59.716 --> 07:02.351
To contract his larnyx's.

07:06.089 --> 07:08.323
Anyway, what was I saying?

07:08.391 --> 07:10.158
Ah! Yes.

07:10.226 --> 07:13.562
True love.

07:16.599 --> 07:19.101
When was the last
time you spoke to him?

07:19.168 --> 07:21.668
On the telephone two days ago.

07:21.736 --> 07:23.666
Okay, and what's his name?

07:26.101 --> 07:28.769
<i>Peter bishop.</i>

07:28.836 --> 07:31.002
Wait a minute. That's wrong.

07:31.070 --> 07:32.470
My mom doesn't love peter.

07:32.538 --> 07:33.604
<i>Of course not.</i>

07:33.672 --> 07:35.573
It's just a story.

07:35.640 --> 07:39.175
But, as with all good stories,

07:39.243 --> 07:41.778
<i>Things aren't always
as they seem.</i>

07:41.845 --> 07:43.946
So where were we?

07:44.014 --> 07:45.347
She just took the case.

07:45.415 --> 07:47.049
Oh, yes. How could she not?

07:47.116 --> 07:51.185
See, what rachel didn't know

07:51.253 --> 07:54.989
Is that detective olivia
once believed in love.

07:55.056 --> 07:57.558
Especially great love.

07:57.625 --> 08:00.927
And, if for no other reason,
she took this case

08:00.995 --> 08:04.130
To see if such a
love really existed.

08:04.197 --> 08:08.667
Now, this is where things
might get a bit frightening.

08:08.735 --> 08:11.502
I'm not sure you'd
want me to go on.

08:11.570 --> 08:13.237
Does it have to do with peter?

08:13.305 --> 08:15.506
Maybe.

08:15.574 --> 08:17.341
It just might.

08:17.409 --> 08:21.278
You see, just as olivia

08:21.346 --> 08:23.380
Was gathering the
facts from rachel,

08:23.448 --> 08:26.950
Far on the other side of town,

08:27.018 --> 08:30.687
A young man had gone into hiding

08:30.755 --> 08:36.159
Because he had in his
possession a very special item.

08:36.227 --> 08:38.695
what kind of item?

08:38.763 --> 08:40.530
as it happens...

08:42.633 --> 08:44.267
A heart.

08:44.335 --> 08:50.540
But a heart unlike anything
the world had ever seen.

Now...The measure
of a good detective

Is where she gets her
information from.

09:29.533 --> 09:37.573
* *

09:39.843 --> 09:41.644
Is he here?

09:41.712 --> 09:46.548
Detective dunham knew some
high people in low places.

09:49.619 --> 09:53.652

escape from the sound *

10:09.997 --> 10:12.298
Hello, lieutenant broyles.

10:12.366 --> 10:14.299
Good to see you.

10:16.268 --> 10:17.934
What's the matter?
You're not gonna say hello?

10:18.002 --> 10:20.269
Well, now, I didn't know
if you actually meant hello

10:20.337 --> 10:23.239
Or if you were just
stringing me along.

10:23.306 --> 10:24.306
You're good at that.

10:24.374 --> 10:26.910
I need to ask a favor.

10:26.978 --> 10:28.875
Must be a good one if
you're coming to me.

10:28.943 --> 10:31.511
Not as good a favor as
pretending six years ago

10:31.579 --> 10:33.143
I didn't see a cop on the beat

10:33.211 --> 10:35.711
Plant evidence to
get a promotion.

10:35.779 --> 10:38.513
But yeah, it's important.

10:42.657 --> 10:43.760
What is it?

10:43.827 --> 10:47.300
Missing person.

10:47.368 --> 10:48.902
Never seen him.

10:48.970 --> 10:52.568
What about this?

10:52.635 --> 10:54.603
<i>Does it mean anything to you?</i>

10:56.505 --> 10:58.405
That guy's sweetheart
found it in her apartment

10:58.473 --> 11:01.475
The night he vanished.

11:08.917 --> 11:11.519
<i>It's a company logo.
Massive dynamic.</i>

11:11.586 --> 11:13.153
Ever heard of them?

11:13.221 --> 11:14.688
No. What do they do?

11:14.756 --> 11:16.857
Question is, what don't they do?

11:16.924 --> 11:20.526
indeed, what don't they do?

11:20.594 --> 11:21.794
Olivia did her homework

11:21.861 --> 11:24.363
And soon found out some
of the things they did do.

11:24.430 --> 11:25.497
like what?

11:25.565 --> 11:27.232
massive dynamic made its money

11:27.299 --> 11:28.766
At any cost.

11:28.834 --> 11:31.902
A vile firm that never
missed an opportunity

11:31.970 --> 11:34.170
To exploit the little guy.

11:34.238 --> 11:37.338
Profiteering off the
creativity of others.

11:37.406 --> 11:38.771
<i>Miss dunham...</i>

11:38.839 --> 11:40.773
Nina sharp.

11:40.840 --> 11:41.907
Pleasure to meet you.

11:41.975 --> 11:43.541
Thank you so much for seeing me.

11:43.609 --> 11:45.309
Detective broyles
called on your behalf.

11:45.377 --> 11:47.811
He said you were
looking for someone?

11:47.879 --> 11:50.047
You thought I may be able
to provide some information?

11:50.115 --> 11:51.681
Uh, yes.

11:51.749 --> 11:54.017
His name is peter bishop.

11:54.084 --> 11:55.618
I'm investigating
his disappearance

11:55.686 --> 11:57.186
On behalf of his fiancee.

11:57.254 --> 11:58.954
She believes he
may be in trouble.

11:59.022 --> 12:00.956
Yeah, that wouldn't surprise me.

12:01.024 --> 12:02.057
Whatever trouble he's in,

12:02.125 --> 12:04.292
I'm sure he deserves much worse.

12:04.360 --> 12:06.327
Peter bishop is a con man

12:06.395 --> 12:08.262
With many talents and
many identities--

12:08.330 --> 12:09.563
All of them suspect.

12:09.630 --> 12:13.132
Small cons to large scale
industrial espionage,

12:13.200 --> 12:15.668
With only one person's
interests at heart--

12:15.735 --> 12:17.669
His own.

12:17.736 --> 12:18.870
I see.

12:18.937 --> 12:20.471
But I can tell you one thing.

12:20.539 --> 12:22.873
If he's pretending
to love this woman,

12:22.941 --> 12:24.574
He must be using her somehow.

12:24.642 --> 12:28.077
<i>For her sake and yours,
I hope he stays missing.</i>

12:28.145 --> 12:29.912
He's dangerous.

12:31.748 --> 12:33.415
Ah, I'm sorry.

12:33.483 --> 12:35.884
My attention is required
on another matter.

12:35.951 --> 12:37.218
Of course.

12:37.286 --> 12:39.787
Thank you so much for your time.

12:39.855 --> 12:41.488
Miss dunham.

12:43.157 --> 12:45.691
You should proceed with caution.

12:45.759 --> 12:48.893
I meant it when I said that
peter bishop is dangerous.

13:01.804 --> 13:03.804
It's me.

13:03.872 --> 13:06.139
There has been a development.

13:09.077 --> 13:11.612
Hello, this is rachel.
Please leave a message.

13:11.679 --> 13:13.647
uh, this is olivia dunham.

13:13.715 --> 13:16.316
I need to talk to you.
It's about peter bishop.

13:16.384 --> 13:18.318
So could you give me a call
as soon as you get this?

13:20.787 --> 13:22.253
Rachel? Help me, miss dunham!

13:22.321 --> 13:24.054
rachel!

14:07.044 --> 14:08.511
that's not how it goes.

14:08.579 --> 14:09.545
She can't be dead.

14:09.613 --> 14:10.879
Why not?

14:10.947 --> 14:13.448
Probably because it's
her mother, walter.

14:13.516 --> 14:15.484
Oh. No, that's not it.

14:15.552 --> 14:18.053
Because that's not
how stories work.

14:18.121 --> 14:19.989
She's in love-- true love.

14:20.056 --> 14:21.423
She can't die.

14:21.491 --> 14:22.591
But...

14:22.659 --> 14:25.260
As I have said, in this story,

14:25.328 --> 14:26.829
Things are not as they seem.

14:26.897 --> 14:29.532
<i>She was an actress.</i>

14:29.600 --> 14:31.635
<i>Her real name wasn't even rachel,
it was kelsey.</i>

14:31.702 --> 14:32.736
<i>Don't ask me</i>

14:32.803 --> 14:34.571
What to make of it,
we're in the dark.

14:34.638 --> 14:36.439
But whoever did this was good.

14:36.507 --> 14:38.807
Didn't leave fingerprints.

14:38.874 --> 14:42.610
Hell, we can't even identify
what type of weapon he used.

14:42.677 --> 14:44.878
But one thing we both know,
dunham--

14:44.946 --> 14:48.547
Death seems to
follow you around.

14:48.614 --> 14:50.681
What you sayin' there, chief?

14:50.749 --> 14:53.884
I'm saying I want you
as far away as possible.

14:53.951 --> 14:55.885
Just when my interest is piqued?

14:55.952 --> 14:58.087
Keep nosing around,
and you and your interest

14:58.154 --> 15:00.155
Can spend some time downtown
as a guest of the state.

15:00.223 --> 15:02.857
Well, it's three hot
meals and a bed.

15:02.924 --> 15:05.025
It's tempting. But, uh...

15:05.093 --> 15:07.627
I think I'll pass.

15:07.695 --> 15:11.064
I'm serious, dunham.

15:11.131 --> 15:14.767
Time to leave things
to the big boys.

15:17.804 --> 15:19.538
Okay, you win.

15:43.989 --> 15:45.389
directory assistance?

15:45.457 --> 15:48.359
Yes, operator, I would
like an address, please.

15:48.426 --> 15:49.960
Go ahead, hon. What's the name?

15:50.027 --> 15:53.663
Uh, for dr. Walter bishop.

15:53.730 --> 15:54.797
it's you.

15:54.865 --> 15:56.766
Kind of.

15:56.834 --> 15:59.367
Slightly less handsome
than your uncle walter.

15:59.435 --> 16:00.635
But equally brilliant.

16:00.703 --> 16:03.404
<i>A taker, a dreamer.</i>

16:03.472 --> 16:05.572
And olivia would soon discover

16:05.640 --> 16:08.474
That he was the one that got
her mixed up in all this.

16:08.542 --> 16:10.475
<i>So you're saying that
you hired her</i>

16:10.543 --> 16:13.110
To hire me to find peter bishop?

16:13.178 --> 16:14.545
That's right.

16:14.613 --> 16:16.348
Why didn't you come
to me yourself?

16:16.416 --> 16:20.717
Ah. Your reputation
precedes you, miss dunham.

16:20.785 --> 16:23.653
You aren't the best,
but you're selective.

16:23.721 --> 16:25.488
You only take cases
where someone

16:25.556 --> 16:28.424
Has lost their heart to love.

16:28.492 --> 16:30.793
So I used her to
get your attention.

16:30.861 --> 16:32.828
I never meant for
her to be harmed.

16:32.896 --> 16:35.463
Okay, well, you've got my
attention now, dr. Bishop.

16:35.531 --> 16:37.265
Now who the hell
is peter bishop,

16:37.332 --> 16:38.766
And why are you looking for him?

16:38.832 --> 16:40.898
He was my lab assistant.

16:40.966 --> 16:42.599
You got the same name.
You related?

16:42.667 --> 16:44.967
Just coincidental,

16:45.035 --> 16:48.136
Although I did grow to
love peter as a son.

16:48.204 --> 16:51.972
<i>But apparently, he was far more
dangerous than I feared.</i>

16:52.040 --> 16:54.308
He stole something from me.

16:54.375 --> 16:58.476
My most... Important invention.

17:02.514 --> 17:05.048
I have spent my
life making things

17:05.116 --> 17:07.518
That bring joy and happiness,

17:07.585 --> 17:12.987
To make the world
a better place.

17:13.054 --> 17:17.757
Bubble gum was one of my first.

17:17.825 --> 17:21.026
Ah. Flannel pajamas.

17:21.094 --> 17:23.361
Oh, rainbows.

17:23.429 --> 17:25.463
And my latest project,
singing corpses.

17:25.530 --> 17:26.829
Two, three, four...

17:26.897 --> 17:28.565
* who can take a sunrise *

17:28.633 --> 17:30.534
* who can take a sunrise *

17:30.602 --> 17:31.902
<i>* sprinkle it with dew *</i>

17:31.969 --> 17:33.270
<i>* sprinkle it with dew *</i>

17:33.337 --> 17:37.342
* cover it with chocolate
and a miracle or two *

17:37.409 --> 17:38.743
<i>* the candy man *</i>

17:38.811 --> 17:40.645
<i>* the candy man can *</i>

17:40.712 --> 17:41.845
* 'cause he mixes it with love *

17:41.913 --> 17:46.416
* and makes the
world taste good *

17:46.484 --> 17:49.085
Why not bring a little
life to the dead, I say.

17:51.155 --> 17:52.989
their harmonies are
still a bit off.

17:57.227 --> 17:58.893
What's this?

17:58.961 --> 18:00.527
Well, that's a hug, of course.

18:00.595 --> 18:02.360
he invented hugs?

18:02.428 --> 18:03.761
<i>Oh, yes, my dear.</i>

18:03.828 --> 18:06.296
He invented everything that
is wonderful in the world.

18:06.363 --> 18:08.998
Teddy bears,
and chocolate bars, and...

18:09.066 --> 18:12.100
Oh, and something even
more remarkable than that.

18:12.168 --> 18:14.035
<i>A heart.</i>

18:14.102 --> 18:16.069
A glass heart.

18:16.137 --> 18:18.404
What makes it so special?

18:18.472 --> 18:19.705
Put simply, it's a power source.

18:19.773 --> 18:23.541
But it's capable of
many wondrous things.

18:23.609 --> 18:26.876
And until quite recently...

18:26.944 --> 18:32.348
I was kept alive
his glass heart.

18:32.416 --> 18:34.384
I had a bad heart,

18:34.451 --> 18:37.054
<i>And so I invented the
glass heart.</i>

18:37.121 --> 18:39.223
And then a few nights ago,

18:39.290 --> 18:40.991
Someone slipped into my room

18:41.059 --> 18:44.896
And stole it while I was asleep.

18:44.963 --> 18:48.066
<i>I've done what I can with
these batteries.</i>

18:48.134 --> 18:49.935
It's kept me stable, but...

18:50.003 --> 18:52.738
If I don't get my heart back,
I'll die.

18:52.806 --> 18:55.441
You think peter bishop
stole your heart?

18:55.508 --> 18:57.243
<i>They disappeared at
the same time.</i>

18:57.310 --> 19:00.714
This heart is priceless.

19:00.782 --> 19:03.417
Who knows what somebody
would pay for it.

19:03.484 --> 19:06.854
I have so much good left to do.

19:06.922 --> 19:10.991
If I die, I'll never get
to finish any of them.

19:11.059 --> 19:15.896
All of my ideas...

19:15.963 --> 19:18.365
They will all die with me.

19:20.501 --> 19:21.935
she's gonna help him, right?

19:22.003 --> 19:23.603
Of course.

19:23.671 --> 19:28.110
But first, she needed
to rehire her assistant,

19:28.178 --> 19:30.812
Esther ficklesworth.

19:34.984 --> 19:37.752
I have plenty of experience
with all kinds of people.

19:37.820 --> 19:40.821
I'm sure that would
come in handy, right?

19:40.889 --> 19:44.858
I mean, mental patients
probably need tons of patience.

19:47.395 --> 19:48.328
And love too.

19:48.396 --> 19:51.898
They probably need love, right?

19:51.966 --> 19:55.801
* I really need this job *

19:55.869 --> 19:59.805
* please god, I need this job *

19:59.873 --> 20:05.711
* I've got to get this job *

20:08.114 --> 20:10.849
I'm sorry, excuse me.

20:10.917 --> 20:13.485
Oh, it's my old boss now.

20:13.552 --> 20:14.820
Can you give me just a second?

20:14.888 --> 20:17.124
She only calls when
it's important.

20:17.191 --> 20:19.026
Or when she gets lost.

20:19.094 --> 20:20.727
what do you want?

20:20.795 --> 20:22.496
New case. I need you.

20:22.563 --> 20:24.197
You sent me packing
this morning,

20:24.265 --> 20:26.566
And you owe me six
months' back-pay.

20:26.601 --> 20:28.468
What makes you think I'm
gonna drop everything

20:28.536 --> 20:29.769
Just because you call?

20:29.837 --> 20:31.270
Because it's important.

20:31.338 --> 20:34.374
And because that's just
the kind of girl you are.

20:36.076 --> 20:37.377
Dunham?

20:37.445 --> 20:38.413
Dunham, are you--

20:40.349 --> 20:41.916
Drop what you're investigating.

20:41.984 --> 20:44.719
Who the hell are you?

20:44.787 --> 20:46.587
I'm the man who doesn't
let his feelings

20:46.655 --> 20:49.857
Get him into trouble.

20:54.095 --> 20:57.097
Ah!

20:59.500 --> 21:03.402
Don't stick your heart out
where it doesn't belong.

21:22.085 --> 21:24.420
I'm sorry. Does it hurt?

21:24.487 --> 21:26.288
Oh, no, no, no.
It feels great, actually.

21:26.356 --> 21:29.092
Please, keep-- keep doing it.

21:29.159 --> 21:31.627
I can't believe you got
sucked back into business

21:31.695 --> 21:32.762
Over true love.

21:32.829 --> 21:35.699
You know that's your problem,
isn't it?

21:35.766 --> 21:37.434
You're always looking
for something

21:37.502 --> 21:39.636
That doesn't even exist.

21:39.704 --> 21:41.705
Hey, that's not true.

21:41.773 --> 21:43.339
I'm not looking for someone

21:43.407 --> 21:44.974
Who's gonna give his
heart to the world.

21:45.041 --> 21:48.009
Maybe somewhere in the
universe there's gotta be a guy

21:48.077 --> 21:50.412
Who will keep me
warm when I'm cold,

21:50.480 --> 21:52.848
Feed me when I'm hungry,

21:52.916 --> 21:55.583
And maybe, on occasion,
take me dancing.

21:55.651 --> 21:59.153
Mm.

21:59.221 --> 22:01.890
Huh, that's odd.

22:01.958 --> 22:04.429
<i>It looks like it's healing.</i>

22:04.496 --> 22:07.601
<i>What kind of weapon did
you say he used?</i>

22:07.669 --> 22:09.773
Well, nothing that
I'd ever seen before.

22:09.841 --> 22:11.110
It was, like, some kind of...

22:11.178 --> 22:13.113
Laser.

22:13.181 --> 22:16.785
This is the same kind of
wound that killed rachel.

22:16.853 --> 22:17.988
So the man who attacked me

22:18.057 --> 22:19.725
Is the same man who
took her heart.

22:19.793 --> 22:22.230
Draw it.

22:22.298 --> 22:23.500
Draw what?

22:23.567 --> 22:25.470
The weapon.

22:25.537 --> 22:27.672
I have an idea.

22:27.739 --> 22:31.943
Yeah, the patent on this
device was taken out last year.

22:32.010 --> 22:34.811
Pretty cool little device,
if I recall.

22:34.879 --> 22:37.112
Was patented by this
whiz-bang tech company

22:37.180 --> 22:39.080
Out of manhattan.

22:39.147 --> 22:42.882
Boy, I wish I could work
somewhere like that.

22:42.950 --> 22:47.188
Big outfit,
all kinds of spy stuff.

22:49.060 --> 22:50.596
They go by the name of...

22:50.664 --> 22:53.101
Massive dynamic.

22:53.169 --> 22:54.904
You can't go in there!

22:54.972 --> 22:56.373
<i>Miss dunham!</i>

22:56.440 --> 22:59.074
A few hours ago,
a man attacked me with that,

22:59.142 --> 23:00.242
And told me to forget

23:00.310 --> 23:02.010
I'd ever heard the
name peter bishop.

23:02.078 --> 23:05.080
Now I can call the feds or
you can tell me the truth.

23:05.147 --> 23:06.781
You choose, lady.

23:10.085 --> 23:11.685
Bring me the file on
the quantum laser.

23:13.621 --> 23:15.755
The device was developed here

23:15.823 --> 23:17.190
In our biomedical research lab.

23:17.258 --> 23:19.091
It was designed as
a surgical tool.

23:19.158 --> 23:22.193
Several months ago,
one of our prototypes was stolen.

23:22.260 --> 23:25.629
But tell me... This
man who attacked you,

23:25.697 --> 23:28.630
Was he bald, with an odd
cadence to his voice?

23:28.698 --> 23:30.565
Who is he?

23:30.633 --> 23:33.068
Not he, they.

23:33.136 --> 23:34.770
We call them the watchers.

23:34.837 --> 23:36.704
These people are dangerous

23:36.772 --> 23:38.739
And they don't
make idle threats.

23:38.807 --> 23:39.907
You should know what

23:39.975 --> 23:42.343
You're getting into,
miss dunham.

23:44.113 --> 23:45.146
she was lying.

23:45.214 --> 23:47.181
Who? Nina sharp.

23:47.249 --> 23:48.849
She was lying, wasn't she?

23:48.917 --> 23:50.350
What makes you think that?

23:50.417 --> 23:52.484
I don't know,
I just don't trust her.

23:52.552 --> 23:54.519
Smart girl.

23:54.587 --> 23:56.621
You're getting ahead
of the narrative,

23:56.688 --> 23:59.390
But you're thinking
along the right lines.

23:59.458 --> 24:02.026
Because detective olivia
didn't trust her either.

24:02.094 --> 24:03.094
Now...

24:28.083 --> 24:29.984
Hello?

24:30.051 --> 24:31.618
<i>it's me. You got anything?</i>

24:31.686 --> 24:34.253
<i>nina sharp's company,
massive dynamic,</i>

24:34.320 --> 24:37.120
The founder and ceo is a
guy named william bell.

24:37.188 --> 24:38.321
<i>You ever heard of him?</i>

24:38.389 --> 24:40.023
No. Should I have?

24:40.090 --> 24:41.490
<i>Well, it seems he's a sort of</i>

24:41.558 --> 24:43.525
<i>Scientific christopher
columbus.</i>

24:43.593 --> 24:45.761
He's always searching for
what's right on the edge

24:45.828 --> 24:47.462
Of our imagination.

24:47.530 --> 24:49.430
<i>But here is the
interesting part.</i>

24:49.497 --> 24:52.294
<i>In the past few years,
no one has seen him.</i>

24:52.361 --> 24:55.696
No press conferences,
no public appearances.

24:55.764 --> 24:58.298
It's like he just disappeared
off the face of the earth.

24:58.366 --> 25:00.700
<i>okay, so what's that got to
do with peter bishop?</i>

25:00.767 --> 25:02.435
<i>I don't know.</i>

25:02.502 --> 25:04.136
<i>But that's weird, right?</i>

25:04.204 --> 25:05.537
<i>yeah. Listen, I gotta go.</i>

25:05.605 --> 25:06.738
<i>hey, dunham?</i>

25:06.806 --> 25:09.007
<i>Yeah? Be careful.</i>

25:09.074 --> 25:11.909
Okay, ma.

25:24.989 --> 25:27.524
<i>I have news.
Is it safe to talk?</i>

25:27.591 --> 25:29.426
<i>of course, no one can hear us.</i>

25:29.493 --> 25:32.061
<i>What is it? I found it.</i>

25:32.129 --> 25:34.496
<i>The glass heart? Mm,
you were right.</i>

25:34.564 --> 25:35.864
<i>Peter bishop has it.</i>

25:35.932 --> 25:38.299
<i>so where is he?
Where's the boy?</i>

25:38.367 --> 25:42.402
<i>We don't know yet.
But we'll find him.</i>

25:42.470 --> 25:44.437
Oh, that's fabulous news.

25:44.504 --> 25:47.072
Well done, nina.
I knew you could do it.

25:47.139 --> 25:50.174
<i>William, I've been going
out of my mind.</i>

25:50.242 --> 25:52.710
By utilizing the heart's power,

25:52.778 --> 25:55.415
We'll be able to create a
stable door between universes.

25:55.483 --> 25:56.584
And after all this time,

25:56.651 --> 25:59.053
<i>We can finally be
together again.</i>

25:59.121 --> 26:01.122
<i>I know, my love. </i>

26:20.076 --> 26:21.009
Excuse me.

26:21.077 --> 26:23.978
She is awake.

26:26.714 --> 26:29.515
I see.

26:29.582 --> 26:31.149
<i>I suppose I should feel
sorry for you,</i>

26:31.217 --> 26:32.483
Miss dunham.

26:32.551 --> 26:34.284
None of these should've
been your concerns.

26:34.352 --> 26:36.920
<i>The truth is I did everything
I could to protect you.</i>

26:36.988 --> 26:38.923
I warned you to
stay away from this,

26:38.991 --> 26:40.692
But you didn't listen.

26:40.759 --> 26:42.460
Now you've given me no choice.

26:42.528 --> 26:44.829
Oh, so you're gonna send
me somewhere far away,

26:44.897 --> 26:46.464
Where I won't be
able to tell anybody

26:46.531 --> 26:48.499
What you wanna do
with that glass heart?

26:48.566 --> 26:50.600
Not quite.

26:52.303 --> 26:53.937
Go ahead, mr. Gemini.

26:57.341 --> 26:58.408
<i>No, no!</i>

26:58.475 --> 27:00.810
No, no, no! Ah.

27:35.643 --> 27:38.544
Ah!

27:38.612 --> 27:41.680
No!

27:41.748 --> 27:44.749
Help me!

27:49.922 --> 27:52.924
No! Ah!

28:04.935 --> 28:07.370
I heard you were looking for me.

28:29.025 --> 28:32.361
Thank you.

29:10.927 --> 29:12.264
And get a second one free.
Feeling better?

29:12.332 --> 29:13.367
Do you mean is a hot shower

29:13.435 --> 29:15.504
Better than drowning
in a pine coffin?

29:15.572 --> 29:17.007
Much. Thank you.

29:20.046 --> 29:21.549
I take it you don't live here.

29:21.617 --> 29:23.353
No, but nobody else does either.

29:23.421 --> 29:25.490
Seemed like a pretty
good place to hide out.

29:25.558 --> 29:27.830
But this is yours.

29:27.897 --> 29:29.632
Yeah.

29:29.700 --> 29:31.169
What is it?

29:31.236 --> 29:33.938
You hungry?

29:36.241 --> 29:37.841
<i>So how'd you know I
was drowning?</i>

29:37.909 --> 29:40.544
Coffee?

29:40.612 --> 29:42.812
Yeah, one sugar. Thanks.

29:42.880 --> 29:44.213
<i>Well, like I told you before,</i>

29:44.281 --> 29:46.014
I heard somebody
was looking for me.

29:46.080 --> 29:48.447
A cop named olivia dunham.

29:48.515 --> 29:49.916
<i>So I was following you.</i>

29:49.984 --> 29:52.022
Well, someone's been giving
you false information,

29:52.091 --> 29:54.060
Because I'm not a cop,
I'm a private detective.

29:54.129 --> 29:57.899
I see.

29:57.967 --> 29:59.133
You like jazz?

29:59.201 --> 30:00.968
Jazz?

30:01.036 --> 30:04.136
Miles, duke, louis,
john coltrane...

30:04.204 --> 30:05.438
You can tell a lot
about a person

30:05.505 --> 30:06.472
From the music they listen to.

30:06.539 --> 30:09.007
<i>And whether or not they dance.</i>

30:10.710 --> 30:13.945
Uh, well, jazz... Not so much.

30:14.012 --> 30:18.148
But dancing? Sure.

30:18.216 --> 30:21.384
Well, I guess we're opposites.

30:21.452 --> 30:23.986
I hate to dance.

30:24.054 --> 30:26.055
I'd take you, though.

30:28.858 --> 30:31.124
You would?

30:31.192 --> 30:32.559
Why's that?

30:32.627 --> 30:35.227
I don't know,
seems like it'd be fun.

30:35.295 --> 30:37.262
You look like a good dancer.

30:45.003 --> 30:46.269
You know, all this is very nice,

30:46.337 --> 30:47.871
And I'm grateful that
you saved my life,

30:47.939 --> 30:50.307
But I know who you are,
and I know what you did.

30:50.375 --> 30:52.508
Wanna know why I was
looking for you?

30:52.576 --> 30:54.944
Dr. Walter bishop hired me.

30:55.011 --> 30:59.213
<i>I know you took his
glass heart.</i>

30:59.281 --> 31:03.750
Is that what he told you?

31:03.818 --> 31:06.486
That I stole his heart?

31:06.553 --> 31:08.888
<i>What else did walter
bishop tell you?</i>

31:08.955 --> 31:11.490
That without his
heart he would die.

31:11.557 --> 31:13.792
And that all the good
he does for this world

31:13.859 --> 31:14.826
Would die with him.

31:14.894 --> 31:16.494
Well, I guess I'm
not the only one

31:16.562 --> 31:18.028
Who's been given
false information.

31:18.096 --> 31:19.563
What, yo saying that's not true?

31:19.630 --> 31:21.965
Come with me.

31:28.806 --> 31:30.574
147 pins.

31:30.642 --> 31:33.644
Each one represents a child
injured by walter bishop.

31:33.712 --> 31:35.479
Injured how?

31:35.546 --> 31:37.547
<i>Walter's invented a great
many things.</i>

31:37.615 --> 31:40.016
Wondrous things.
That much is true.

31:40.084 --> 31:44.153
But what he didn't tell you
is where his ideas come from.

31:44.220 --> 31:46.421
Elephants, rainbows,
licorice sticks...

31:46.489 --> 31:50.391
They come from the
dreams of children.

31:50.459 --> 31:53.661
He steals children's dreams

31:53.729 --> 31:56.063
And he replaces them
with nightmares.

31:56.131 --> 31:57.565
That's what this is,

31:57.633 --> 31:59.066
A pattern of destruction.

31:59.134 --> 32:03.071
Of damaged kids,
shattered innocence.

32:05.074 --> 32:07.174
Who else knows about this?

32:07.242 --> 32:09.376
Nobody.

32:09.443 --> 32:10.610
I worked for him for years,

32:10.677 --> 32:13.678
And I didn't even know.

32:13.746 --> 32:17.013
Why I was willing to die
so that he could live.

32:27.120 --> 32:29.121
It's your heart.

32:29.188 --> 32:33.024
I was born with it.

32:33.092 --> 32:37.561
And I was willing to
give it to walter,

32:37.629 --> 32:40.530
'cause of all the
good he's done.

32:40.598 --> 32:42.599
Because of all the
good he could do.

32:42.667 --> 32:43.867
I thought that his life

32:43.934 --> 32:46.235
Was so much more
valuable than mine.

32:46.303 --> 32:49.104
At least until I
learned the truth.

32:49.172 --> 32:51.506
Walter bishop isn't responsible

32:51.574 --> 32:54.075
For all the goodness
in the world.

32:54.143 --> 32:57.011
But he is responsible
for so much evil.

33:04.888 --> 33:05.887
Oh, hell.

33:05.955 --> 33:07.289
What is it?

33:07.356 --> 33:08.757
They found us.

33:10.526 --> 33:13.560
Run!

34:08.342 --> 34:10.309
I knew you were a good dancer.

34:10.377 --> 34:12.978
You really cut a rug out there.

34:13.045 --> 34:15.344
Well, you're not
so bad yourself.

34:21.049 --> 34:24.484
I need your help, olivia.

34:26.219 --> 34:28.721
I'm dying.

34:37.105 --> 34:40.440
Okay, I got them.

34:40.509 --> 34:44.310
So--so what do I do?

34:44.378 --> 34:47.478
Well...

34:47.547 --> 34:49.648
You ever play that
game operation?

34:49.715 --> 34:51.114
Yeah. Well, it's just like that,

34:51.183 --> 34:52.382
Except in reverse.

34:52.451 --> 34:56.320
You gotta put those
batteries into my chest.

34:56.387 --> 34:58.755
But whatever you do,

34:58.823 --> 35:00.823
Don't touch the nerve endings.

35:00.891 --> 35:03.292
And what if I do?

35:03.360 --> 35:05.261
Don't.

35:08.866 --> 35:11.634
Okay.

35:14.571 --> 35:16.805
Hey...

35:16.873 --> 35:18.873
You're gonna be fine.

35:18.941 --> 35:21.275
Just go slow,

35:21.343 --> 35:23.877
And take them one at a time.

35:23.945 --> 35:25.945
Okay.

35:33.517 --> 35:35.250
So what made you
wanna be a detective?

35:35.317 --> 35:38.252
I don't know.

35:38.320 --> 35:41.622
Uh, I, uh...

35:41.690 --> 35:43.791
I guess that I just always knew

35:43.859 --> 35:46.528
What it was I was meant to do.

35:46.595 --> 35:49.697
And what's that?

35:49.765 --> 35:52.667
To care for people.

35:52.734 --> 35:55.469
Then who cares for you?

36:04.143 --> 36:06.779
Okay.

36:06.846 --> 36:08.481
I did it.

36:08.549 --> 36:10.282
Okay.

36:10.350 --> 36:13.352
There's one more.

36:15.522 --> 36:17.923
Must be nice to
know who you are.

36:17.990 --> 36:22.226
To know your place in the world.

36:22.294 --> 36:25.028
So what about you?

36:25.096 --> 36:27.197
Oh, I thought I did.

36:27.264 --> 36:30.201
I thought I knew who I was.

36:30.269 --> 36:33.971
But I was wrong.

36:34.039 --> 36:37.040
Done.

36:40.178 --> 36:41.845
Peter?

36:41.912 --> 36:46.048
Peter? Peter?

36:46.116 --> 36:50.085
Please, peter.

36:51.620 --> 36:55.389
* for once in my life *

36:55.457 --> 36:59.759
* I have someone who needs me *

36:59.827 --> 37:04.897
* someone I've needed so long *

37:07.466 --> 37:10.835
* for once unafraid *

37:10.902 --> 37:14.837
* I can go where life leads me *

37:14.905 --> 37:21.675
* and somehow I know
I'll be strong *

37:22.910 --> 37:25.712
* for once in my life *

37:25.779 --> 37:31.083
* I won't let sorrow hurt me *

37:31.151 --> 37:36.520
* not like it's hurt me before *

37:38.256 --> 37:41.758
* for once I have something *

37:41.825 --> 37:46.395
* I know won't desert me *

37:46.463 --> 37:51.834
* I'm not alone anymore *

38:08.550 --> 38:10.651
Peter.

38:10.718 --> 38:12.251
Hey.

38:12.319 --> 38:15.654
Hey.

38:15.721 --> 38:20.424
You did it.

38:20.492 --> 38:23.127
Okay. You be careful.

38:23.195 --> 38:24.794
These batteries aren't
gonna last long.

38:24.862 --> 38:26.095
Okay. We have to
get my heart back.

38:26.162 --> 38:28.763
Those men who attacked us,
they work for nina sharp.

38:28.831 --> 38:31.231
But nina sharp isn't the
one who's got your heart.

38:31.299 --> 38:33.566
Then who does?

38:38.470 --> 38:39.904
<i>put it down, dr. Bishop.</i>

38:41.973 --> 38:44.174
How did you know it was me?

38:44.242 --> 38:47.210
The device--the one that
came through the wall--

38:47.278 --> 38:51.747
I knew that I had seen
it someplace before.

38:51.815 --> 38:55.449
You brought nina sharp's
watchers to your side.

38:55.516 --> 38:58.184
Didn't you?

39:09.560 --> 39:14.796
Peter. Peter!

39:14.864 --> 39:17.464
I--I never meant to hurt anyone.

39:17.532 --> 39:21.668
I never-- I can change,
you'll see.

39:21.736 --> 39:24.538
I can make up for all
the harm I've done.

39:24.606 --> 39:26.640
Peter, please.

39:26.708 --> 39:29.543
* who can take the sunrise *

39:29.611 --> 39:32.746
* sprinkle it with dew *

39:32.814 --> 39:35.416
* the candy man can *

39:40.988 --> 39:43.355
Peter, please.

39:46.959 --> 39:48.960
It's too late, walter.

39:49.027 --> 39:51.526
There's some things
you can't undo.

40:03.106 --> 40:05.374
* the candy man can *

40:05.442 --> 40:08.511
* 'cause he mixes it with love *

40:08.579 --> 40:12.315
* and makes the
world taste good *

40:12.382 --> 40:14.283
are you kidding?

40:14.350 --> 40:16.084
That's not a proper ending.

40:16.152 --> 40:18.086
Don't you know?

40:18.154 --> 40:20.321
All good stories start
with "once upon a time,"

40:20.389 --> 40:23.057
And they end with "
happily ever after."

40:23.125 --> 40:25.927
You don't know how to tell stories,
uncle walter.

40:25.994 --> 40:28.329
I'll tell you how
the story ends.

40:28.397 --> 40:31.865
Peter. Peter, please.

40:31.933 --> 40:33.131
I can change.

40:33.196 --> 40:35.861
I can fix the damage I've done.

40:35.929 --> 40:38.530
<i>Please, give me another chance.</i>

40:44.069 --> 40:46.637
and peter looked
inside walter's eyes

40:46.705 --> 40:50.140
And realized there was
still goodness inside him.

40:50.207 --> 40:54.010
So peter took his special heart,

40:54.078 --> 40:57.613
And with all his might,
he split it in two.

40:59.282 --> 41:02.683
And the heart was so magical
that it still worked.

41:05.720 --> 41:13.759
* *

41:31.207 --> 41:33.308
And together,
they made goodness,

41:33.376 --> 41:36.745
And lived happily ever after.

41:36.812 --> 41:38.779
The end.

41:43.151 --> 41:44.417
Aunt liv!

41:44.485 --> 41:47.252
We had so much fun. Did you?

41:47.320 --> 41:49.687
<i>That's great. We played
games kind of badly.</i>

41:49.755 --> 41:51.422
<i>Then uncle walter told
me a story.</i>

41:51.489 --> 41:53.256
I'm sorry, walter. No luck.

41:53.324 --> 41:54.991
<i>His ending wasn't very good.</i>

41:55.059 --> 41:58.026
