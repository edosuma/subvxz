00:02.160 --> 00:03.207
Previously on Arrow:

00:03.360 --> 00:06.125
When I'm with you,
I don't think about the mission or...

00:06.280 --> 00:08.567
I trust your judgment.
In fact, I depend on it.

00:09.640 --> 00:11.722
They're designated "Task Force X."

00:11.880 --> 00:15.043
This ain't no task force.
Let's call it like it is.

00:15.280 --> 00:16.691
The Suicide Squad.

00:16.840 --> 00:19.411
- The choice has been made.
- I'm not accepting it.

00:19.560 --> 00:21.801
- There will be consequences.
- Is that a threat?

00:28.280 --> 00:32.250
You tell everyone who will listen
what you've seen.

00:40.800 --> 00:42.928
- You are late.
- It's 12:45.

00:43.080 --> 00:45.924
Invitation said 1. I'm early.
And I'm never early.

00:46.080 --> 00:49.926
Yeah, well, the ceremony's at 1.
Photos were at noon.

00:50.080 --> 00:51.525
- Photos.
- Mm-hm.

00:53.200 --> 00:59.765
Last time Lyla and I got married, we said
our vows on an ATV in a Registan desert.

00:59.920 --> 01:04.084
This time, she hired a photographer.
So, yes, Oliver, photos.

01:04.239 --> 01:06.766
That whole "best man" thing,
it's more like a...

01:06.960 --> 01:09.725
- Not so good.
- No. That's all right. We'll Photoshop you in.

01:09.920 --> 01:11.251
All right.

01:17.880 --> 01:19.006
- Thank you for coming.
- Heh.

01:20.120 --> 01:22.282
- See you brought your plus one.
- Oh, yeah.

01:22.440 --> 01:24.966
- Nice to meet you. Ray Palmer.
- John Diggle.

01:25.120 --> 01:28.761
- You hurt her, they'll never find your body.
- Ha. Ha, ha.

01:28.920 --> 01:31.127
Nice to meet you. Pardon me.

01:31.880 --> 01:35.327
Funny. Five months since we saw
each other. Now it's twice in two weeks.

01:35.480 --> 01:37.960
- It's good to see you, Ray.
- Good to see you too.

01:39.560 --> 01:42.166
Ooh. That was Lyla.

01:42.320 --> 01:45.802
Rick was supposed to be our officiant,
but he got deployed to South Sudan.

01:46.000 --> 01:47.684
- You don't have a minister?
- No.

01:47.840 --> 01:51.083
Okay. What about online certificates?
I need Wi-Fi and three minutes.

01:51.240 --> 01:54.164
Not that I'd officiate,
although I would be honored if you ask.

01:54.320 --> 01:57.961
Or you could just ask me. I'm a minister.

01:59.680 --> 02:01.284
It's a long story.

02:06.080 --> 02:10.483
Normally this is the part where the officiant
offers words of insight about the couple.

02:11.240 --> 02:12.924
Their history.

02:13.080 --> 02:16.766
Which is difficult for me because I just
met John and Lyla eight minutes ago.

02:19.680 --> 02:22.365
And I understand
that you have written your own vows.

02:22.520 --> 02:25.126
Which is great,
because that gives me less to do.

02:34.600 --> 02:37.046
- You really wanna do this?
- Hell, yes.

02:38.040 --> 02:41.362
- Do you?
- Even more than the first time.

02:41.520 --> 02:44.967
Good. Because I'm not letting you
get away from me this time.

02:45.120 --> 02:47.885
- I'm holding you to that.
- Good.

02:49.840 --> 02:52.810
- I love you, Lyla.
- I love you too.

02:52.960 --> 02:54.405
All right.

02:54.560 --> 02:59.851
John Diggle, Lyla Michaels,
I now pronounce you husband and wife.

03:27.240 --> 03:29.686
- Beautiful ceremony.
- Beautiful dress.

03:29.840 --> 03:33.925
- Thank you.
- Did it come with a cast?

03:34.080 --> 03:38.847
I started fighting with a new trainer.
She's enthusiastic.

03:39.000 --> 03:41.082
- "She"?
- She's a friend.

03:41.280 --> 03:43.601
Today's not about that.

03:45.600 --> 03:46.931
- Hey, Laurel.
- Hi.

03:47.680 --> 03:49.125
Nice bouquet.

03:49.280 --> 03:53.285
Ah, yes. I kind of caught it.

03:53.480 --> 03:55.767
- Well done.
- Thank you.

03:58.120 --> 04:00.282
Oh, I hope it's okay
I brought Ray as my date.

04:00.480 --> 04:01.925
Ray saved the day.

04:02.080 --> 04:04.811
For the record,
I am not the one who used that phrase.

04:05.000 --> 04:09.050
He's a good guy
and he clearly cares about you a lot.

04:10.000 --> 04:13.129
- Are you happy?
- Yes. Very.

04:13.280 --> 04:15.601
Good. That's all I've ever wanted.

04:16.440 --> 04:18.408
You deserve a good guy
and a normal life.

04:30.440 --> 04:31.601
Oliver.

04:43.480 --> 04:46.006
There were eight victims total,
all shot with arrows.

04:46.160 --> 04:48.925
However, one escaped
and has given us a statement.

04:49.080 --> 04:52.527
Which remains uncorroborated
so the district attorney's office...

04:52.680 --> 04:55.684
...is going to continue
to investigate before filing charges.

04:55.840 --> 04:59.162
So which one is it?
ls the Arrow being implicated here or not?

04:59.360 --> 05:01.010
We're not sure of anything yet.

05:01.160 --> 05:03.970
We have a statement from Mr. Palmer.

05:06.600 --> 05:09.683
While it's hard to ignore the good
Arrow has done for this city...

05:09.840 --> 05:12.525
...it is equally hard to ignore
evidence of his guilt.

05:12.680 --> 05:15.365
In any case,
the Arrow needs to be apprehended.

05:15.560 --> 05:17.801
And at least brought to
trial, if not justice.

05:18.000 --> 05:20.207
I didn't know he was gonna do that.

05:20.360 --> 05:22.488
I'm devoting my substantial
resources towards...

05:22.640 --> 05:24.881
...making certain the Arrow
is apprehended.

05:31.080 --> 05:33.162
Meet with Lance and tell him
it wasn't you.

05:33.320 --> 05:36.210
- My word doesn't carry weight with him.
- Bring in the culprit.

05:36.360 --> 05:39.045
- Figure out who's doing this.
- We know who's doing this.

05:39.200 --> 05:42.488
- The League of Assassins.
- This is how Ra's al Ghul handles rejection?

05:42.640 --> 05:45.405
No, I think the point is that he doesn't.

05:45.600 --> 05:49.844
He's trying to turn the city against me. Make
the offer to take his place more appealing.

05:50.960 --> 05:52.007
Hit the streets.

05:52.200 --> 05:55.727
Whoever's doing this targets criminals.
We need to know who they'll hit next.

05:56.120 --> 05:58.930
We need the information
the police have from the crime scene.

05:59.120 --> 06:02.681
Whoever is under that hood
has to leave a trail, something to follow.

06:02.880 --> 06:04.245
How can we help?

06:04.400 --> 06:07.085
- Go to Starling City Airport.
- Okay. To do what?

06:07.240 --> 06:09.561
- It's called a honeymoon.
- Fiji can wait.

06:09.760 --> 06:12.240
No. Fiji can't wait.

06:13.240 --> 06:16.767
All right? This is still your day.
I'm not gonna let Ra's al Ghul ruin that.

06:16.920 --> 06:20.720
- Oliver...
- You followed me into the lion's den already.

06:21.200 --> 06:22.850
This time, choose your family.

06:23.720 --> 06:26.405
Go. Live. We got this.

06:35.840 --> 06:38.764
If it doesn't feel right
for you to go, we won't.

06:38.960 --> 06:41.440
No, Oliver was right. It's our turn.

06:41.640 --> 06:44.371
Besides, Felicity and Roy have his back.

06:51.520 --> 06:53.363
Mazel tov, newlyweds.

06:54.680 --> 06:56.250
Lawton.

06:56.800 --> 07:00.646
- What are you doing here?
- Hey, when duty calls, we answer, right?

07:01.680 --> 07:04.081
The Suicide Squad rides again.

07:18.880 --> 07:21.884
Sorry to interfere with your
wedding night.

07:22.080 --> 07:23.286
Yeah, I doubt that.

07:23.440 --> 07:27.570
Five hours ago, there was a
terrorist attack in the Republic of Kasnia.

07:27.720 --> 07:31.327
Hospital was supposed to serve and unite
Kasnia's dissident ethnic faction.

07:31.480 --> 07:33.847
- Wait, is that...?
- Senator Joseph Cray.

07:34.000 --> 07:36.765
This hospital was something
of a pet project for him.

07:36.920 --> 07:39.321
Of course, he insisted on
being at the ceremony.

07:39.520 --> 07:42.967
Agent Michaels, you'll lead
Task Force X on the extraction.

07:43.120 --> 07:46.124
I'll have a plane ready for you
in 30 minutes.

07:46.280 --> 07:48.362
I'm sorry, Johnny.

07:50.280 --> 07:53.489
You go on to Fiji,
and I will meet you there in 48 hours tops.

07:53.640 --> 07:57.167
No, you won't, because
I'm not letting you out of my sight.

07:57.600 --> 08:00.490
You remember what I told you
about not letting go?

08:00.640 --> 08:02.369
I meant that.

08:05.360 --> 08:06.964
Waller.

08:07.120 --> 08:10.363
Count me in.
You have the two of us. Deadshot.

08:10.520 --> 08:12.045
Who else is on the team?

08:12.240 --> 08:14.971
Who else, indeed?
I've always wanted to see the world.

08:15.880 --> 08:18.804
I hear Kasnia's beautiful
this time of year.

08:31.840 --> 08:33.126
Anything?

08:33.320 --> 08:37.644
I'm accessing traffic cameras, ATM cameras,
phone cameras, 911 and squad car chatter.

08:37.799 --> 08:40.405
- And?
- No sign of evil Arrow.

08:40.559 --> 08:42.881
Los Halcones are unloading
a shipment of narcotics.

08:43.080 --> 08:46.801
The entire gang is gonna show up. This
is the thing fake Arrow would go after.

08:47.000 --> 08:48.923
We really need a better name for him.

08:49.080 --> 08:52.084
- When is this happening?
- Right now. I'll suit up.

08:52.280 --> 08:56.330
Roy, this is the League. I've got it.

09:09.040 --> 09:11.884
- So did you hire a florist?
- Yes, we did.

09:12.040 --> 09:13.610
Didn't that cost a fortune?

09:17.400 --> 09:20.722
For my wedding, I'll have the bridesmaids
make the flower arrangements.

09:20.880 --> 09:23.565
And I'll spend the extra money
on the dress.

09:23.760 --> 09:25.842
- Anything?
- Nope. We're clear.

09:27.200 --> 09:30.249
- You seeing anybody, Cutter?
- Of course I am.

09:30.400 --> 09:35.247
The Arrow. And our special day
is going to be the most glorious day.

09:35.400 --> 09:40.440
And then afterwards, we'll make
strong, beautiful babies. Ha, ha.

09:40.640 --> 09:42.608
And does he know this?

09:43.360 --> 09:47.729
Listen, I got news for you, stalker. You don't
get to do what we do and have a family.

09:47.880 --> 09:51.407
I have a wife right here and a child
that say otherwise. Let's hold up here.

09:51.560 --> 09:53.801
Yeah, well, let's hope
you make it home to her.

09:53.960 --> 09:57.885
Love, children, family. It's all just
a distraction for people like us.

09:58.040 --> 10:00.964
They make us better.
Give us something worth fighting for.

10:01.160 --> 10:06.007
Love is a bullet in the brain and if you believe
any different, you're as crazy as she is.

10:06.160 --> 10:08.003
- Hey.
- All right.

10:08.240 --> 10:11.403
Latest satellite flyover
reveals warm bodies here.

10:11.560 --> 10:16.282
Yeah, that's pretty solid. Fortified.
How are we gonna get everyone out?

10:16.600 --> 10:19.410
Our orders are to retrieve Cray,
no one else.

10:19.560 --> 10:22.006
- What about the hostages?
- They're not U.S. citizens.

10:22.160 --> 10:23.810
Are those your words or Wailer's?

10:23.960 --> 10:26.531
Let's not fight, Johnny.
It's our honeymoon.

10:29.800 --> 10:31.006
See what I mean, John?

10:31.880 --> 10:33.962
I'm not you, Lawton.

10:36.400 --> 10:38.004
Yeah.

10:38.320 --> 10:40.527
I wasn't always me either.

10:52.680 --> 10:55.445
Just leave the package at the door.

10:55.600 --> 10:59.810
Ma'am, I think you're gonna
want to sign for these.

11:01.520 --> 11:05.047
Ah! Oh, my God. Floyd.

11:11.360 --> 11:14.045
Why didn't you tell me
you were coming home? I'm a mess.

11:14.200 --> 11:15.725
No.

11:15.880 --> 11:17.962
No, you're perfect.

11:27.920 --> 11:30.571
Mommy, who is he?

11:30.720 --> 11:35.089
Zoe, baby, this is your daddy, remember?

11:35.240 --> 11:37.481
I told you about him.

11:37.640 --> 11:42.089
He was far away fighting the bad guys.
Now he's home.

11:43.440 --> 11:44.487
Hi, Zoe.

11:46.000 --> 11:48.685
Your daddy missed you
every second of every day.

11:50.600 --> 11:53.570
She just needs some time.

11:56.920 --> 12:00.925
I got him. Satellite footage of a man. Green
outfit. Green hood on the roof. Hurry.

13:11.240 --> 13:13.686
You can't kill them all, Oliver.

13:16.040 --> 13:19.362
Where one falls, two more rise.

13:19.560 --> 13:20.925
Maseo.

13:21.080 --> 13:23.287
You can't believe in this.

13:23.440 --> 13:26.364
Murdering all of these people
just to prove a point?

13:26.560 --> 13:29.211
No. To persuade you.

13:29.960 --> 13:32.327
My master sees something in you.

13:32.840 --> 13:35.650
Don't fight it. Embrace it.

13:36.120 --> 13:37.804
You know me better than that.

13:38.000 --> 13:42.369
Don't let your recalcitrance
take any more lives.

14:16.640 --> 14:20.804
Okay, I had no idea the sheer number
of crazies that were in the city...

14:21.000 --> 14:24.243
...until you set up that
1-800 line for Arrow tips.

14:24.400 --> 14:26.243
What's going on?

14:28.200 --> 14:29.850
Ray?

14:31.680 --> 14:34.570
Oliver Queen is the Arrow.

14:36.560 --> 14:38.210
What?

14:40.120 --> 14:43.567
I have a 140 IQ and three PhDs, but...

14:43.720 --> 14:47.042
It's pretty hard to insult my intelligence,
but I think you just did.

14:50.200 --> 14:54.444
It all makes sense now.
Your, uh, sudden disappearances.

14:54.600 --> 14:56.682
Your apprehension with helping
on the mission.

14:56.840 --> 14:58.410
You've been working with the Arrow.

14:58.560 --> 15:00.528
How did you find out?

15:01.600 --> 15:03.967
High spectrum portable radiograph.

15:04.440 --> 15:09.446
Colloquially known as the x-ray machine.
Plus, your facial recognition software.

15:09.600 --> 15:11.967
- Nice code, by the way.
- Hey, you got the suit working.

15:12.120 --> 15:13.565
Hm.

15:15.280 --> 15:19.251
Last night, I saw your friend Oliver
standing over eight of his victims.

15:19.400 --> 15:20.811
Because he was investigating.

15:20.960 --> 15:23.964
He's trying to catch an impersonator,
the one who's doing this.

15:25.280 --> 15:28.124
Please, you have to trust me.
Oliver's not a killer.

15:28.320 --> 15:31.244
This isn't the first time he's been
judge, jury and executioner.

15:31.400 --> 15:35.325
- He hasn't killed anyone in nearly two years.
- That really is not your best argument.

15:35.480 --> 15:37.721
You have no idea what he's been through.

15:37.880 --> 15:43.410
What he's lost. How he's grown. But I do.
I know him better than almost anyone.

15:44.920 --> 15:46.490
Oliver didn't do this.

15:47.840 --> 15:50.650
- You have feelings for him.
- Yes.

15:50.840 --> 15:52.968
I mean, no.

15:53.120 --> 15:54.849
No.

15:55.000 --> 15:56.684
I did.

15:56.840 --> 15:58.444
But that's...

15:59.080 --> 16:01.811
- That's over now.
- And what?

16:03.160 --> 16:04.924
Now I'm supposed to trust you?

16:05.080 --> 16:08.129
From the moment we've met,
I've held nothing back from you.

16:09.480 --> 16:11.369
I did trust you.

16:11.520 --> 16:16.367
And I thought that you were
someone who could be a true partner.

16:16.960 --> 16:23.320
Thought you were someone that I could
rely on in my mission and in my life.

16:24.120 --> 16:26.726
I wanted that too, Ray. I still do.

16:28.680 --> 16:30.205
Ray-

16:31.240 --> 16:33.208
What are you going to do?

16:34.080 --> 16:36.287
I'm gonna honor the promise
I made to this city.

16:36.480 --> 16:38.847
And help them bring the Arrow to justice.

16:59.560 --> 17:00.846
North entrance clear.

17:04.800 --> 17:08.088
Nice work, Deadshot.
We're en route. Move to the X.

17:08.280 --> 17:10.044
Copy that.

17:18.800 --> 17:21.609
Here you go, sweetie. Eat it.

17:23.560 --> 17:25.324
You won't eat it.

17:25.599 --> 17:30.083
Is there something wrong with it?
It's not as good as Mom makes, I guess.

17:31.800 --> 17:33.529
Use your words!

17:34.000 --> 17:36.890
- Hm?
- Baby, what's going on?

17:37.040 --> 17:39.611
- Nothing. I'm fine.
- No.

17:39.800 --> 17:41.609
You're not fine.

17:42.360 --> 17:45.682
You're not sleeping. You barely eat.

17:46.360 --> 17:49.887
You can't hold a job. You can't socialize.

17:50.600 --> 17:51.647
You won't talk to me.

17:52.680 --> 17:54.284
We're talking right now.

17:54.440 --> 17:56.841
So tell me what do you
want to talk about?

17:57.000 --> 17:59.367
I wanna know what happened
to my husband.

17:59.520 --> 18:03.127
You need to tell your story.
There are people who can help you.

18:03.280 --> 18:05.567
Who know
what it's like to come back from war.

18:05.720 --> 18:08.121
They don't understand.
You don't understand.

18:08.280 --> 18:11.807
Nobody understands, do you hear me?

18:11.960 --> 18:14.361
- Make them understand.
- Oh, make them understand.

18:14.960 --> 18:17.725
Like this? You want to
make them understand like that?

18:17.880 --> 18:21.805
How about like this? Huh? Do you want to
know what happened to your husband?

18:21.960 --> 18:24.725
Let me tell you. He pulled triggers.

18:24.880 --> 18:27.724
And every time I did, someone died.

18:27.880 --> 18:29.962
Okay? Every single time.

18:30.920 --> 18:32.365
Floyd.

18:33.000 --> 18:34.081
Stop it.

18:35.640 --> 18:37.165
Please.

18:45.320 --> 18:47.004
Get away from us.

18:50.080 --> 18:52.321
Yes, this is an emergency.

18:52.520 --> 18:54.409
It's my husband. He has a gun.

19:03.520 --> 19:05.648
Find anything on those arrows?

19:06.200 --> 19:09.682
This one is ours. This one is theirs.

19:09.840 --> 19:12.446
- I don't see a difference.
- Yeah. Precisely.

19:12.600 --> 19:14.329
They're identical.

19:15.360 --> 19:17.010
He knows.

19:17.160 --> 19:19.049
God, he knows.

19:22.120 --> 19:25.203
Last year, Ray's fiancé
was killed by Mirakuru men.

19:25.360 --> 19:29.729
And now he wants to protect the city so he
built a suit out of military-grade technology.

19:29.880 --> 19:33.009
He wants to put you in jail.
He used my software to track you down.

19:33.160 --> 19:37.131
He scanned you with his x-rays. He knows
you're the Arrow. He's gonna tell the cops.

19:37.720 --> 19:39.131
Palmer knows I'm the Arrow?

19:41.040 --> 19:43.168
He has his own mission
to protect the city?

19:45.680 --> 19:47.523
When were you gonna tell me this?

19:47.680 --> 19:50.001
I've been getting a lot of that.
It's not important.

19:50.160 --> 19:52.527
He's gonna tell the police who you are.

19:52.680 --> 19:56.890
Wait, Ray built a super suit?
That's kind of awesome.

19:57.040 --> 19:58.246
And reckless.

19:59.000 --> 20:03.483
Look, he's probably on his way to the
precinct right now. What are we gonna do?

20:06.000 --> 20:10.722
The radiograph technology is infallible.
These are screenshots with time stamps.

20:11.920 --> 20:13.684
That's a very bold claim, Mr. Palmer.

20:13.840 --> 20:17.765
Especially since we've been down that road
two years ago when Queen was exonerated.

20:17.920 --> 20:20.924
Because he's smart. I believe he
allowed himself to be accused...

20:21.080 --> 20:23.686
...so as to be ruled out
as a suspect in the future.

20:25.920 --> 20:29.606
And your proof is x-ray vision?

20:30.920 --> 20:34.288
Digital images can be fabricated.
I can't go to a judge with any of that.

20:34.480 --> 20:36.130
What about my statement?

20:36.280 --> 20:38.726
You mean your
uncorroborated testimony.

20:41.960 --> 20:46.124
You're protecting him. Of course.
Because you and Oliver are old friends.

20:46.640 --> 20:49.371
You, uh, hurt yourself
signing depositions?

20:52.000 --> 20:55.641
- At the gym, actually.
- Right. You were training with that...

20:55.800 --> 21:00.010
...wildcat, Grant, right?
The one who also used to be a vigilante.

21:01.040 --> 21:03.407
You and Oliver Queen
used to be a couple, right?

21:04.040 --> 21:06.486
How is it you both
ended up wearing masks?

21:07.880 --> 21:10.645
A word of free legal advice, Mr. Palmer...

21:10.800 --> 21:13.280
...if you go to anyone else,
particularly the media...

21:13.440 --> 21:15.249
...with these unsubstantiated
aflegafionsu.

21:15.800 --> 21:19.168
...Mr. Queen would have the basis
for a slam dunk defamation suit...

21:19.320 --> 21:21.482
...that would leave you bankrupt.

21:21.960 --> 21:25.407
Who knows?
He might even get his company back.

21:26.040 --> 21:29.840
Yeah. You're right. The court system
isn't gonna be able to help me here.

21:31.360 --> 21:32.691
Ah.

21:34.760 --> 21:37.843
Guess I'll just have to seek out
justice on my own.

21:53.640 --> 21:57.326
Don't worry. I'm a United States senator.

21:57.480 --> 21:59.767
Everything's gonna be all right.

22:02.760 --> 22:04.649
Get down! Get down! Get down!

22:18.360 --> 22:21.364
We're here for you, senator,
but we need to move fast.

22:22.160 --> 22:25.881
All right. Everybody, just stay
where you are. Keep calm.

22:26.080 --> 22:30.404
- We'll explain everything once we're in the air.
- What? No. No. This...

22:31.680 --> 22:36.129
It's all wrong. They weren't supposed
to send anybody. That was the whole point.

22:38.840 --> 22:40.922
You shouldn't have come here.

22:44.240 --> 22:46.163
You shouldn't have come here.

22:51.720 --> 22:53.768
We gotta go! We gotta go! Go! Go! Go!

22:57.080 --> 22:58.605
My hero.

22:58.760 --> 23:00.444
Fall back! Fall back! Fall back!

23:05.920 --> 23:09.720
What the hell was that lunatic thinking?
Secure these doors. Lawton, on the table.

23:11.920 --> 23:13.410
Take off that shirt.

23:13.560 --> 23:16.131
Bullet was a through and through.
I ain't gonna die.

23:16.280 --> 23:19.045
Pays to be sure. It's
not a request, soldier.

23:36.400 --> 23:37.890
You still gonna patch me up?

23:41.800 --> 23:45.964
Baby, does it hurt bad?
You were so brave.

23:46.160 --> 23:48.128
Okay, I take it back.

23:48.320 --> 23:49.970
I think I do want to die.

23:50.120 --> 23:53.329
Mockingbird, this is Harbinger on
emergency frequency Delta-Charlie.

23:54.480 --> 23:57.609
Task Force X is broadcasting
in the blind. Over.

23:57.760 --> 24:01.765
Damn it. It's not going through.
I think our signal's being jammed.

24:01.960 --> 24:04.406
Harbinger, this is Senator Cray.

24:04.560 --> 24:09.726
Well, I imagine you must all be feeling
a little bit confused right about now.

24:09.920 --> 24:12.571
This is a hostage situation.
A terrorist attack...

24:12.760 --> 24:18.961
Oh, actually, they're not terrorists.
They're mercenaries. They work for me.

24:19.120 --> 24:22.329
- Why would you do that?
- Because I love my country.

24:22.520 --> 24:24.443
And my country loves a hero.

24:26.000 --> 24:28.321
So this is all theater?

24:28.480 --> 24:31.370
- So you can what? Run for president?
- There it is.

24:31.520 --> 24:33.010
The big picture.

24:33.240 --> 24:35.811
Can you imagine what my
poll numbers will be...

24:35.960 --> 24:39.362
...once I heroically defuse
this tragic situation?

24:39.520 --> 24:43.445
Everybody here
was supposed to go home alive.

24:43.600 --> 24:45.523
That was the whole point.

24:45.720 --> 24:51.124
But now, unfortunately, you have turned my
hostages into witnesses.

24:51.280 --> 24:52.611
And I can't have that.

24:52.800 --> 24:56.885
- I'm gonna kill you slow, you son of a bitch.
- You're outgunned and outnumbered.

24:57.040 --> 24:59.042
But if it's any consolation...

24:59.200 --> 25:04.843
...I am gonna nominate the four of you
for the Medal of Honor once I'm president.

25:05.000 --> 25:06.525
You'll be remembered as heroes.

25:19.120 --> 25:20.645
L-leh-

25:20.800 --> 25:23.644
- Arrow.
- Super Suit.

25:24.400 --> 25:25.731
I prefer the Atom.

25:25.880 --> 25:29.407
I have to admit, I was surprised
to find you on my calendar this morning.

25:29.560 --> 25:30.721
Find the place all right?

25:30.920 --> 25:34.242
- Laurel Lance called me.
- Yeah. The Black Canary.

25:34.400 --> 25:37.051
She tried to shut me up,
but it's not gonna work.

25:37.200 --> 25:41.000
- I didn't kill those people.
- Yeah. That's what Felicity said.

25:41.160 --> 25:45.051
An impersonator, right?
I hate when that happens.

25:49.520 --> 25:51.249
Five years on a deserted island.

25:51.440 --> 25:54.569
That kind of thing changes you,
doesn't it?

25:54.720 --> 26:00.523
It must have been difficult, if not impossible,
to hold on to your sanity all those years.

26:00.680 --> 26:04.048
And now here you are,
pretending you have everything in control.

26:04.200 --> 26:06.521
Felicity told you the truth.

26:08.360 --> 26:10.522
And you should trust herjudgment.

26:11.520 --> 26:12.885
How can I do that?

26:13.040 --> 26:16.567
Her perception of you is clearly clouded
by her emotional attachment.

26:16.760 --> 26:18.888
She's not seeing you
for what you really are.

26:21.320 --> 26:25.120
You have no idea
what this city is up against.

26:25.920 --> 26:26.967
Actually, I think I do.

26:28.080 --> 26:30.128
And I'm gonna stop him.

26:34.720 --> 26:36.563
It's clear.

26:42.800 --> 26:45.451
- Reinforcements just arrived.
- I see them.

26:45.600 --> 26:47.250
Wait.

26:49.000 --> 26:51.401
- Oh, God.
- What? What? What?

26:51.560 --> 26:55.121
Thermal spikes.
Here. Here. Here. And here.

26:56.880 --> 27:01.283
- They've rigged the hospital with explosives.
- Killing all the hostages.

27:02.280 --> 27:03.805
With Cray as the lone survivor.

27:08.080 --> 27:09.525
Why did we come here?

27:09.680 --> 27:13.162
We accepted the mission, Lyla.
We did what soldiers do.

27:13.480 --> 27:16.882
Except we're not just soldiers, Johnny.
We're parents.

27:18.840 --> 27:22.686
I know parents who won't fly together. They
don't wanna risk orphaning their child.

27:24.160 --> 27:25.844
What were we thinking?

27:26.960 --> 27:28.371
Oh, God.

27:28.840 --> 27:30.365
Our baby girl.

27:30.520 --> 27:34.206
- Lawton was right.
- Can you please say that again?

27:35.320 --> 27:39.166
Sorry, I, uh...
I didn't quite hear you the first time.

27:42.840 --> 27:45.320
The Greddians
have rigged the hospital to blow.

27:46.800 --> 27:50.043
- We're not gonna make it.
- Yeah. Yes, we are.

27:50.200 --> 27:52.521
We're gonna get these hostages out.

27:52.680 --> 27:56.401
And you and John are gonna
make it home to your daughter again.

27:58.040 --> 27:59.201
You got it?

28:01.160 --> 28:05.370
Oh, the things I wanna do
to you right now.

28:20.080 --> 28:23.050
- Floyd Lawton.
- Who's asking?

28:23.200 --> 28:26.249
It wasn't a question.
Merely an acknowledgment.

28:26.400 --> 28:28.767
- We've posted your bail.
- "We"?

28:28.960 --> 28:31.884
An organization in need
of your very particular talent.

28:32.040 --> 28:34.088
"Talent." Heh.

28:34.480 --> 28:36.084
Killing people, you mean.

28:36.240 --> 28:40.086
And we will pay handsomely
for the use of those skills.

28:42.400 --> 28:44.482
Again with the "we."

28:45.000 --> 28:47.890
- Who are you?
- Merely a drone.

28:48.880 --> 28:51.531
A piece of a larger entity.

28:51.680 --> 28:56.766
We exist as one organism.
As you might say, a hive.

28:56.960 --> 29:00.009
Well, listen up, honeybee.
I'm done shooting.

29:01.880 --> 29:06.204
I left that life on the battlefield
to come home, be with my family.

29:06.360 --> 29:10.604
I imagine the restraining order your wife
filed against you impedes that plan somewhat.

29:10.760 --> 29:14.651
You'll never be allowed
near her or your daughter again.

29:14.800 --> 29:16.928
You have left the battlefield.

29:17.480 --> 29:20.211
But the battlefield never leaves you.

29:20.400 --> 29:25.566
People like you don't get to
have love, children, families.

29:25.720 --> 29:28.326
These are just distractions
to people like you.

29:29.640 --> 29:33.281
For people like you,
love is a bullet in the brain.

29:40.840 --> 29:42.569
Who's my target?

29:44.280 --> 29:48.171
His name is Andrew Diggle.

30:03.680 --> 30:06.286
- How'd it go with Ray?
- Not well.

30:06.440 --> 30:08.568
Yeah, your new boyfriend is stubborn.

30:08.720 --> 30:10.848
Once he's made his mind up,
that's the end of it.

30:11.280 --> 30:12.930
Sound like anybody we know?

30:13.360 --> 30:16.443
Not only is he untrained, he's unstable.

30:16.600 --> 30:19.524
- "Unstable"?
- Yeah. Yes. Yeah, he's unstable, Felicity.

30:19.680 --> 30:22.490
Because he's flying around in a weapon...

30:22.640 --> 30:26.361
...looking for a man
that has already killed eight people.

30:27.520 --> 30:30.524
- He's gonna be next.
- You'd like that, wouldn't you?

30:31.720 --> 30:32.881
Excuse me?

30:35.320 --> 30:37.527
- You never wanted me to be with him.
- Not true.

30:37.680 --> 30:40.809
Yes, it is. That talk about
wanting me to be happy was just talk.

30:40.960 --> 30:46.046
No, I meant what I said. Right up to the point
where I found out that he is just like me.

30:46.200 --> 30:49.409
- You deserve better.
- What I deserve...

30:49.560 --> 30:52.404
...is to be with someone
who isn't afraid of being happy.

30:55.840 --> 31:01.483
Ray told me he wanted a true partner. In
his work, in his mission and in his life.

31:01.640 --> 31:03.642
Ray wants to be a hero
and a human being.

31:03.840 --> 31:06.081
Because he hasn't realized yet
that he can't be.

31:07.400 --> 31:13.726
I told you that I couldn't be with you
and save the city.

31:15.240 --> 31:16.605
And neither can Ray.

31:18.400 --> 31:20.528
He's just too new at this to know that.

31:23.600 --> 31:25.443
- What's that?
- 911 call.

31:25.600 --> 31:27.921
Suspected gang activity
at Meltzer power plant.

31:28.600 --> 31:30.921
This could be Maseo's next target.
Call Roy.

31:31.080 --> 31:33.082
Tell him to suit up,
meet me at the power plant.

31:45.960 --> 31:47.724
There's no one here.

31:51.280 --> 31:53.521
That must be disappointing.

31:54.160 --> 31:58.609
I'm sorry there's nobody for you to kill,
but, uh, I kind of faked that 911 call.

31:58.760 --> 32:01.286
- Palmer.
- I'd say you have the right to remain silent...

32:01.480 --> 32:03.244
...but I'm not a cop.

32:12.480 --> 32:14.050
No.

32:22.080 --> 32:23.491
Agh!

32:41.320 --> 32:42.924
It's over.

32:43.920 --> 32:46.082
That's it. Nice and easy.

33:04.160 --> 33:08.961
The man you think I am,
he'd kill you here and now.

33:09.120 --> 33:14.001
I told you to back off,
and you didn't listen.

33:14.160 --> 33:16.242
So kill me. Go ahead.

33:16.880 --> 33:18.962
Show Felicity the kind of man
you really are.

33:22.280 --> 33:24.203
I have nothing to prove to her.

33:28.040 --> 33:29.963
But you do.

33:36.280 --> 33:38.203
She chose you.

33:38.960 --> 33:41.088
So trust her.

33:58.320 --> 34:00.288
I am, uh...

34:01.480 --> 34:03.801
I am truly sorry.

34:04.560 --> 34:07.803
Everything was supposed to
work out differently.

34:09.920 --> 34:11.409
At the door!

34:17.199 --> 34:22.525
Stop or I flip this switch
and I blow us all right to hell right now.

34:23.199 --> 34:26.283
You're bluffing.
You'd die right along with us.

34:26.440 --> 34:29.762
I wanna be president for my legacy.

34:29.960 --> 34:33.203
Dying a hero is as good
a consolation prize as any.

34:48.600 --> 34:49.806
The Suicide Squad.

34:52.840 --> 34:55.730
Well, you are true to your name
if you think that the three of you...

34:55.880 --> 34:57.848
...can just shoot your way in here.

35:03.800 --> 35:06.565
Wait. There were four of you.

35:06.760 --> 35:07.921
Unh!

35:14.240 --> 35:15.651
John, 7 o'clock.

35:30.680 --> 35:34.127
You've been a very, very bad boy.

35:35.280 --> 35:38.648
Go. Go. Go. Everybody go, go, go!
Get out. Go.

35:38.800 --> 35:40.086
Move! Move! Move!

35:41.000 --> 35:42.081
Move! Move!

35:42.920 --> 35:44.490
Come on.

35:44.640 --> 35:47.689
Come on, let's go. Quickly.

35:48.920 --> 35:51.048
What about you, baby?
How are you getting out?

35:51.200 --> 35:52.770
I'm not.

35:53.680 --> 35:56.570
That's not part of the plan.
You said you could find your way.

35:57.200 --> 36:00.443
Yeah, I lied.
Someone needs to cover your escape.

36:00.600 --> 36:03.171
Me up here is what
gets you out down there alive.

36:03.320 --> 36:04.970
Why?

36:05.120 --> 36:09.444
You and your new wife, you just get back
to your baby girl. All right, John?

36:09.640 --> 36:11.483
Go. Go. Go.

36:15.640 --> 36:16.687
Move. Move.

36:18.720 --> 36:20.165
Go. Go.
Move. Move.

36:30.240 --> 36:31.730
- Keep on moving.
- Go. Go. Go.

36:31.880 --> 36:33.928
Go. Go. Go.

36:34.640 --> 36:35.721
Come on, Floyd.

36:48.040 --> 36:49.405
No!

36:49.600 --> 36:50.681
No.

37:05.600 --> 37:07.364
How are you?

37:11.600 --> 37:12.761
My ego's bruised.

37:14.960 --> 37:19.124
And my arm, and my back,
and my rotator cuff.

37:20.520 --> 37:22.966
I'm so sorry about...

37:23.800 --> 37:25.290
...all of this.

37:25.440 --> 37:30.651
Ah, well, actually, I think I'm the one
who owes you an apology.

37:31.560 --> 37:37.283
You told me Oliver was innocent, and I didn't
trust you. I want you to know that I do.

37:38.960 --> 37:41.406
About what you said earlier...

37:42.400 --> 37:45.244
...about wanting a true partner...

37:47.640 --> 37:49.802
...is that offer still good?

37:50.480 --> 37:52.164
Yeah.

37:53.160 --> 37:54.810
Once I make an offer.

38:02.240 --> 38:04.766
The Greddian separatists
were led by Floyd Lawton...

38:04.920 --> 38:07.764
...a former sniper
for the United States Army.

38:07.920 --> 38:10.924
Lawton was discharged five years ago
and since then...

38:11.080 --> 38:14.163
...has been linked
to numerous terrorist organizations.

38:14.320 --> 38:18.962
Lawton died as a result of an explosion
intended for a group of hostages...

38:19.120 --> 38:21.964
...including Senator Joseph Cray.
But Cray managed...

38:22.120 --> 38:24.282
He paid the hostages for their silence.

38:24.440 --> 38:27.091
Yeah. Well, the dollar
goes a long way in Kasnia, right?

38:29.200 --> 38:33.364
I tried to set the record straight.
Waller blocked me.

38:35.040 --> 38:38.362
Johnny, there's something else.

38:39.520 --> 38:41.204
Yes, there is.

38:49.880 --> 38:51.962
- I'm leaving Team Arrow.
- What?

38:52.120 --> 38:54.691
Lawton was right.
I can't keep living like this.

38:56.280 --> 39:00.205
It only works until it doesn't.
And then what?

39:02.120 --> 39:03.724
I can't do that to Sara.

39:04.960 --> 39:06.564
And what about this city?

39:07.200 --> 39:11.330
The work you and Oliver do,
it's good work.

39:12.160 --> 39:14.731
Not like what I've
been doing for far too long.

39:16.200 --> 39:20.205
Which is why I resigned.

39:20.360 --> 39:24.490
Lyla, no. You love your job.
And you're damn good at it.

39:24.640 --> 39:27.564
If what happened with Cray can be allowed,
I don't want to be.

39:27.760 --> 39:31.242
What I want is to set
a good example for our daughter.

39:32.880 --> 39:34.928
I want her to be proud of me.

39:35.080 --> 39:36.730
Lyla.

39:38.000 --> 39:39.047
I'm proud of you.

39:41.160 --> 39:42.605
I'm proud of you, Lyla.

39:43.320 --> 39:45.721
Nothing's ever gonna change that.

39:54.600 --> 39:56.523
- Hey.
- Hi.

39:56.680 --> 39:59.570
- Where you off to?
- Ray has a meeting with the mayor.

39:59.720 --> 40:02.121
Seems he's had
a change of heart about the Arrow.

40:02.280 --> 40:03.327
Huh.

40:03.480 --> 40:05.767
- Thanks.
- For what?

40:06.600 --> 40:08.045
Proving me right.

40:15.240 --> 40:16.969
- Hey.
- Hi.

40:17.160 --> 40:18.446
What did I miss?

40:18.680 --> 40:22.287
Oh, not much. I'm glad you're back.

40:22.480 --> 40:27.805
So am I. Turns out Lyla and I
are not very good at vacations.

40:27.960 --> 40:31.567
- The Republic of Kasnia, huh?
- Mm-hm.

40:32.280 --> 40:34.328
And Floyd Lawton?

40:34.480 --> 40:35.891
Yeah.

40:37.480 --> 40:39.323
You were right, Oliver.

40:39.480 --> 40:43.326
Doing what we do,
having loved ones at home...

40:44.960 --> 40:46.644
...it's complicated.

40:46.800 --> 40:49.007
Well, the things that matter always are.

40:49.160 --> 40:50.491
To Floyd Lawton.

40:59.640 --> 41:01.085
Any luck finding your imposter?

41:01.600 --> 41:02.931
He's still out there.

41:03.080 --> 41:06.323
We have to stop this guy before
he puts arrows in any more criminals.

41:06.520 --> 41:10.161
Or before he starts putting them
in innocent people.

41:13.400 --> 41:15.050
Madam, I have it on good authority...

41:15.240 --> 41:16.969
...he's been set up.
Hold on a second.

41:17.160 --> 41:19.447
You're telling me you think
the Arrow's innocent?

41:19.600 --> 41:22.763
Of these murders, yes.
I believe he's being framed.

41:22.920 --> 41:24.809
We need to address the media right away.

41:25.000 --> 41:27.128
Tell them what?
Some genius changed his mind?

41:27.280 --> 41:31.171
You're letting your personal feelings
towards the Arrow cloud your judgment.

41:31.320 --> 41:33.800
Maybe I'm seeing more clearly
than I have for years.

41:33.960 --> 41:36.201
Enough, both of you.
I am tired of listening...
