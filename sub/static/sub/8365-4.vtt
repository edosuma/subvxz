WEBVTT

00:02.237 --> 00:04.571
(Door slams)

00:04.573 --> 00:07.340
- David?

00:07.342 --> 00:10.310
David, what is this?!

00:10.312 --> 00:12.812
- It looks like a bike.

00:12.814 --> 00:14.814
- Is it yours?

00:14.816 --> 00:18.385
- Yes. Yes, it is.

00:18.387 --> 00:20.654
- David, what is this
doing here?

00:20.656 --> 00:22.389
- You might wanna read
the note.

00:22.391 --> 00:24.524
- No, is it from Mutt?

00:24.526 --> 00:26.893
David!

00:26.895 --> 00:28.194
No! No!

00:31.266 --> 00:33.099
- I feel like he really
gets you.

00:33.101 --> 00:36.136
Like, I feel like he sees like,
deep into your soul.

00:36.138 --> 00:38.405
I'm not quite sure what
he's seeing exactly,

00:38.407 --> 00:40.840
but there's definitely -
he's looking inward.

00:40.842 --> 00:42.609
- What am I gonna do?!
- About what?

00:42.611 --> 00:43.877
- This is serious, David!

00:43.879 --> 00:45.545
This is so off base!

00:45.547 --> 00:47.414
Arghh!

00:47.416 --> 00:49.316
My God, imagine what kind
of ring he'd buy!

00:49.318 --> 00:51.084
Like an opal, or something.

00:51.086 --> 00:53.320
- Ooh, like a pear-shaped opal.
- (Groans)

00:53.322 --> 00:54.988
(Knocking)
MUTT: Hello, is anybody home?

00:54.990 --> 00:57.190
- No, Mutt!

00:57.192 --> 00:59.526
Hey, you have to support me
in this.

00:59.528 --> 01:00.794
- Mhmm.
- You have to, do you promise me?

01:00.796 --> 01:03.697
- Oh yeah, of course.

01:03.699 --> 01:05.198
- (Calming exhale)

01:06.902 --> 01:08.835
- So...
- Hey you!

01:11.440 --> 01:14.307
This is so special for me.

01:14.309 --> 01:15.342
- Well, I you needed a new
mode of transportation.

01:15.344 --> 01:18.078
- I do!

01:18.080 --> 01:21.147
I do need a mode
of transportation!

01:21.149 --> 01:24.617
And like, a car would be nice,
but do I need a car?

01:24.619 --> 01:27.787
- Not anymore, it appears.

01:27.789 --> 01:29.222
- Well, you said you missed
spin class, so...

01:29.224 --> 01:30.924
- I did!

01:30.926 --> 01:32.592
I did say that I missed
spin class.

01:32.594 --> 01:34.828
And so you bought me a bike!

01:34.830 --> 01:36.863
Because I said that I missed
spin class.

01:36.865 --> 01:40.700
Because you're so thoughtful
and perceptive.

01:40.702 --> 01:43.403
- So you like it?
- Mm, I'd say she loves it.

01:43.405 --> 01:46.539
- Mm-hmm.
- Well, you're gonna need this.

01:46.541 --> 01:48.208
DAVID AND ALEXIS: A helmet!

01:48.210 --> 01:49.776
- It came with the bike.

01:49.778 --> 01:51.544
- I think you should
put it on.

01:51.546 --> 01:52.712
Like, I think you should
actually like,

01:52.714 --> 01:55.115
like, put the helmet on.
- Yeah.

01:55.117 --> 01:57.150
And I will one day,

01:57.152 --> 02:00.086
when we take this little pony
for a joyride!

02:00.088 --> 02:02.422
- Actually, I brought my bike,
so we can test it out.

02:02.424 --> 02:04.924
I thought maybe we could take
a little ride to the cafe.

02:04.926 --> 02:07.427
- Ah! So fun.

02:07.429 --> 02:09.329
(Whispering)
I hate you, David!

02:09.331 --> 02:10.430
- See 'ya!

02:12.034 --> 02:16.202
♪♪

02:18.306 --> 02:20.273
(Low hum of chatter)

02:26.048 --> 02:28.415
- What about lamps?

02:28.417 --> 02:30.984
The lamps at the motel
have those uh...

02:30.986 --> 02:32.919
little bulbs,

02:32.921 --> 02:35.688
These are old-fashioned
big bulb lamps.

02:35.690 --> 02:37.724
- I don't see any bulbs here.

02:37.726 --> 02:39.426
- No there aren't,
but the point is,

02:39.428 --> 02:41.861
we can get big bulbs
if we have big bulb lamps.

02:41.863 --> 02:44.230
- Oh John, I don't know.

02:44.232 --> 02:47.033
Lamps, clothing, jewelry...

02:47.035 --> 02:48.768
Look at this poor woman's life

02:48.770 --> 02:51.304
strewn across cheap folding
tables.

02:53.542 --> 02:56.176
John, do you think they did
this with our things?

02:56.178 --> 02:58.311
- No, not ours, no.

02:58.313 --> 03:01.815
They put our stuff
right on the lawn.

03:01.817 --> 03:05.685
- Strangers picking through
precious pieces we owned!

03:05.687 --> 03:07.654
- I know, and judging us,

03:07.656 --> 03:09.422
like we're judging
this poor woman.

03:09.424 --> 03:10.924
- Well, except they'd
have been saying,

03:10.926 --> 03:12.792
"what great taste they had!"

03:12.794 --> 03:15.628
- I wonder who got
my golf clubs.

03:15.630 --> 03:18.031
Really, John, that's the first
thing that comes to mind?

03:18.033 --> 03:20.667
- They were custom made.

03:20.669 --> 03:23.670
- So was my Galapagonian
tortoiseshell foot bath.

03:23.672 --> 03:25.672
And now some lonely hoarder

03:25.674 --> 03:28.274
is letting his cats
poop in it.

03:28.276 --> 03:32.145
- Well, they were just
things, Moira, just things.

03:32.147 --> 03:35.215
- Yeah, designer,
one-of-a-kind things.

03:35.217 --> 03:39.486
- Yeah, sleek, oak-trimmed,
leather interior,

03:39.488 --> 03:42.822
German-engineered things.
- Oh!

03:42.824 --> 03:45.425
Shopping used to cheer me up.

03:45.427 --> 03:47.260
Big bulbs is not
doing it for me.

03:48.763 --> 03:52.999
(Knock on door)

03:53.001 --> 03:54.501
- (Groans) Oh God.

03:56.938 --> 03:57.318
- Roland!

03:57.344 --> 03:58.838
- Sure, I'll come in,
but just for a second.

03:58.840 --> 04:01.040
BOTH: Ahem!

04:01.042 --> 04:03.510
- Huh!
- (Laughs)

04:03.512 --> 04:06.279
- Can I help you
with something?

04:06.281 --> 04:09.315
- Well um, here's the deal:

04:09.317 --> 04:11.451
Uh, I was thinking
this morning,

04:11.453 --> 04:12.652
And I don't wanna tell you
where I was thinking,

04:12.654 --> 04:14.087
but it was a small room
in my house,

04:14.089 --> 04:15.355
and I was sitting down--
- Okay.

04:15.357 --> 04:17.624
- And I was thinking to myself,

04:17.626 --> 04:22.595
who can I trust to help me
pick out a woman's blouse?

04:22.597 --> 04:26.099
And you know whose name
came to mind?

04:26.101 --> 04:27.467
- I don't-I don't know,
Rachel Zoe?

04:27.469 --> 04:29.836
- Yours!

04:29.838 --> 04:32.172
- I don't know how to take that.

04:32.174 --> 04:35.008
- It's for Jocelyn.
- Mm!

04:35.010 --> 04:36.609
- And you know,
I would do it myself,

04:36.611 --> 04:38.511
it's just that you know,
shopping,

04:38.513 --> 04:40.580
I mean, you go in, you get--

04:40.582 --> 04:42.849
you know, look at the stuff
on the racks,

04:42.851 --> 04:45.351
- Uh huh... - and you pick out, you
know, the colour that you like,

04:45.353 --> 04:47.554
and then you try it on
and make sure it fits you,

04:47.556 --> 04:49.622
- Right.
- and then you buy it and you--

04:49.624 --> 04:51.457
- You're just describing
what shopping is.

04:51.459 --> 04:54.527
- Yes, and normally
I'm fine with that,

04:54.529 --> 04:58.198
it's just I'm looking for
something a little fancy here.

04:58.200 --> 05:01.434
A little um, stylish.
A little elegant.

05:01.436 --> 05:03.336
- Ah...
- You know?

05:03.338 --> 05:06.039
And who knows elegance
better than you, pal?

05:06.041 --> 05:09.442
I mean, you're the only
elegant guy I know!

05:09.444 --> 05:13.680
- So you're looking for me
to style Jocelyn?

05:13.682 --> 05:16.316
- Well, actually, this is
supposed to be a surprise.

05:16.318 --> 05:18.818
So I was kinda thinking
that maybe um,

05:18.820 --> 05:22.355
you and me could just go out
and do a little uh,

05:22.357 --> 05:24.324
shopping together
on the down low.

05:27.395 --> 05:31.931
- Y-Yeah... Yeah, that um...

05:31.933 --> 05:33.433
No, we could to that,
we could do that at some point.

05:33.435 --> 05:35.034
- Oh, great!
- Yeah. Yeah.

05:35.036 --> 05:36.436
- Good, that's terrific.

05:38.440 --> 05:39.772
So then, whenever's good
for you.

05:39.774 --> 05:41.541
- Okay, great.

05:46.915 --> 05:49.249
So you wanna-so you wanna
go now?

05:49.251 --> 05:51.517
- It's a little time sensitive,
that's the only thing.

05:51.519 --> 05:52.719
- Yeah, okay, well, I take it
you have measurements,

05:52.721 --> 05:55.321
and a mood board, then?

05:55.323 --> 05:57.223
- The whole purpose
of having a bike

05:57.225 --> 05:59.726
might be to actually
ride the bike.

05:59.728 --> 06:01.361
- Yeah, I'm just not wearing
the right outfit.

06:01.363 --> 06:02.929
- It's a five minute ride.

06:02.931 --> 06:04.564
- Yeah, so by the time
we get on,

06:04.566 --> 06:07.233
and then we get off,
it's almost not worth it.

06:07.235 --> 06:09.502
- Do you not like the bike?

06:09.504 --> 06:13.072
- No, I love it! It's just
that, um,

06:13.074 --> 06:15.475
there are so many drunk drivers
around here.

06:15.477 --> 06:17.310
- It's 10:00am.

06:17.312 --> 06:19.612
- Mutt, you tell that
to an alcoholic!

06:19.614 --> 06:20.813
- Is it the colour?
Because I mean,

06:20.815 --> 06:23.016
it's totally fixable!
- Okay, fine.

06:23.018 --> 06:25.084
I don't know how to ride
a bike.

06:25.086 --> 06:28.421
- What?
- I said, I don't know how to ride a bike!

06:28.423 --> 06:32.058
(Groans) Ugh!

06:39.834 --> 06:41.534
- Moira, look at these
cufflinks.

06:41.536 --> 06:43.936
- Oh John,

06:43.938 --> 06:45.605
We're better off stealing
cutlery from the cafe!

06:45.607 --> 06:47.707
- No, these look like sterling.

06:47.709 --> 06:49.442
I'm gonna bid on these.

06:49.444 --> 06:51.311
- Hey there, Roses!

06:51.313 --> 06:52.879
- Oh, hi.
- Oh hey, Jocelyn.

06:52.881 --> 06:54.080
- Look at you two
bargain hunters.

06:54.082 --> 06:56.149
You finding anything yet?

06:56.151 --> 06:57.750
- Mm, nothing you couldn't see
fall out of a common

06:57.752 --> 06:59.986
Christmas cracker!

06:59.988 --> 07:02.155
- I think half the fun
is panning for nuggets

07:02.157 --> 07:06.426
at these things.
- Ooh, look at that mattress!

07:06.428 --> 07:08.895
- Well, there you go,
what a find.

07:08.897 --> 07:11.597
- Poor dear, enchanted
by a death bed.

07:11.599 --> 07:13.800
- This is a brand new mattress,
it's still in the plastic!

07:13.802 --> 07:15.968
- What?!
- Yeah!

07:15.970 --> 07:18.738
And it's memory foam!
This must've cost a fortune!

07:18.740 --> 07:21.140
- Well, you're just gonna have
to bid on it.

07:21.142 --> 07:23.776
- John, why didn't you see
that mattress first?!

07:23.778 --> 07:25.812
That's something we could
actually use!

07:25.814 --> 07:28.414
- I'll use the cufflinks!
- What size is it?

07:28.416 --> 07:30.917
- Oh I don't know,
it's at least a queen.

07:30.919 --> 07:34.187
- Well, that's too big
to get home.

07:34.189 --> 07:36.789
- No, we got the truck.
- But awkward, Jocelyn,

07:36.791 --> 07:39.392
and awkward with those
tiny doorways of yours.

07:39.394 --> 07:41.127
- Johnny, help me cover it up.

07:41.129 --> 07:42.595
I don't want other people
to see it.

07:42.597 --> 07:43.629
(Jocelyn grunts with effort)

07:46.901 --> 07:48.935
- Now, we need a top,
and we need a bottom.

07:48.937 --> 07:50.870
Like a skirt,
something like that,

07:50.872 --> 07:53.039
which I know you're familiar
with 'cause you're wearing one.

07:53.041 --> 07:55.141
- Okay, these are pants that
just so happen to have

07:55.143 --> 07:58.277
a pant fabric over the front
and back-- okay.

07:58.279 --> 08:00.613
- Yeah, it's a skirt.
Um, what about this?

08:00.615 --> 08:02.415
It seems durable, yes?

08:02.417 --> 08:05.151
- Yeah um, in fashion,
durable and elegant

08:05.153 --> 08:06.919
rarely go hand in hand.

08:06.921 --> 08:09.455
so I'd put that- put that back.

08:09.457 --> 08:11.591
- Okay, so not that.

08:11.593 --> 08:13.826
- What about this?

08:13.828 --> 08:17.597
Jocelyn seems to like
loud floral prints.

08:17.599 --> 08:21.000
- Yeah, the thing is, um,
this is kind of a special...

08:21.002 --> 08:24.203
kind of blouse.
- Uh-huh.

08:24.205 --> 08:25.571
- Have you ever seen
"The Devil Wears Prada?"

08:25.573 --> 08:27.740
- Obviously!
- Okay, well,

08:27.742 --> 08:30.977
Meryl Streep plays this kind of
powerful, sexy fashion woman--

08:30.979 --> 08:33.780
- Yep, I've seen it!
- Okay, anyway,

08:33.782 --> 08:35.548
Jocelyn and I like to have
a little fun with that idea,

08:35.550 --> 08:37.483
if you know what I mean.

08:37.485 --> 08:39.519
She plays Meryl,
and I play the nervous

08:39.521 --> 08:43.990
but ambitious intern
who's new to the city.

08:43.992 --> 08:45.925
- Oh, so you're the--

08:45.927 --> 08:48.661
So you-you're the Anne
Hathaway in that situation?

08:48.663 --> 08:51.264
- I don't know who that is.

08:51.266 --> 08:52.765
Well, that's more than enough
information for me to go on.

08:55.670 --> 08:57.437
ALEXIS: You're judging me!
MUTT: I'm not!

08:57.439 --> 08:59.005
It's just riding a bike
is a pretty basic skill.

08:59.007 --> 09:01.507
- Mm, is it though?

09:01.509 --> 09:03.409
- I think that most kids
learn how to ride a bike!

09:03.411 --> 09:06.012
- Yeah well, most kids
also get head lice.

09:06.014 --> 09:08.114
I'm sorry if the opportunity
never presented itself.

09:08.116 --> 09:10.183
- Oh what, there was no
gap year in Belgium?

09:10.185 --> 09:12.452
(With a French accent)
No Tour de France boyfriend?

09:12.454 --> 09:16.456
- Yeah, but I never had
to ride the bike!

09:16.458 --> 09:19.292
And David was such
a little drama queen

09:19.294 --> 09:21.494
when my parents tried
teaching him,

09:21.496 --> 09:23.496
that they threw all the bikes
into this big bonfire

09:23.498 --> 09:25.998
up in the Hamptons, and we
never talked about it again.

09:26.000 --> 09:28.935
- Oh.

09:28.937 --> 09:30.937
- Anyway, I have lots of skills
that you don't have.

09:30.939 --> 09:32.738
- I am sure that you do.

09:32.740 --> 09:34.440
- Like, have you ever had
to negotiate in Arabic?

09:34.442 --> 09:36.609
It is very difficult.
- I believe you.

09:36.611 --> 09:38.077
- And try getting into
"Kiss Kiss" in Tokyo

09:38.079 --> 09:39.912
without a lock of human hair.

09:39.914 --> 09:41.747
- Now, you see,
if you can do all that,

09:41.749 --> 09:43.649
I'm pretty sure that you can
learn to ride a bike.

09:43.651 --> 09:47.019
- (Laughs)

09:47.021 --> 09:48.387
- Alexis?

09:51.025 --> 09:52.925
- Sorry, I was just thinking
about this crazy night

09:52.927 --> 09:57.163
at "Kiss Kiss."

09:57.165 --> 09:58.698
(Laughs)

10:03.571 --> 10:06.072
- Well, this might be the closest
we're gonna get to Meryl.

10:06.074 --> 10:09.175
You know, if she got fired
from her job at the magazine,

10:09.177 --> 10:11.611
and started walking
the streets.

10:11.613 --> 10:14.280
- Oh, that's a good one!
We haven't tried that one yet.

10:14.282 --> 10:16.182
- Yeah, I wouldn't.
- No, it's a good idea.

10:16.184 --> 10:19.085
WENDY: Missing Peter Pan?

10:19.087 --> 10:21.888
- I'm sorry?

10:21.890 --> 10:24.657
- Well, because I see
a couple of "Lost Boys."

10:24.659 --> 10:27.894
(Chuckles)

10:27.896 --> 10:32.198
Hi, I'm Wendy. Are we shopping
for a mother, a girlfriend?

10:32.200 --> 10:34.433
- Actually, my wife.
- Oh!

10:34.435 --> 10:35.368
- Yeah, we've got it
under control though,

10:35.370 --> 10:36.936
so thank you so much.

10:36.938 --> 10:39.171
- Oh well, very well, then.

10:39.173 --> 10:42.308
If you need me,
I'll be right here.

10:42.310 --> 10:44.577
I know how hard it can be
for two men

10:44.579 --> 10:47.346
in a women's clothing store.

10:47.348 --> 10:49.048
Well, I'm actually
in really good hands,

10:49.050 --> 10:51.751
because this man
has a woman's touch.

10:51.753 --> 10:52.118
- I don't-I don't know what
that means.

11:00.328 --> 11:02.328
- Okay, so we're gonna take
these pieces.

11:02.330 --> 11:06.732
- Oh well, I have to ask,
is this for a funeral?

11:06.734 --> 11:09.869
Because we do offer
bereavement discounts.

11:09.871 --> 11:11.571
- No, why would you think that?

11:11.573 --> 11:15.241
- Well, just very somber,
serious pieces.

11:15.243 --> 11:17.176
- Well, we don't want that!

11:17.178 --> 11:19.178
- Well, they're not--
- If you're willing,

11:19.180 --> 11:21.380
I have a few new pieces
that just came in,

11:21.382 --> 11:24.050
I'd love for you to see them.

11:24.052 --> 11:25.451
- I just don't know if we need to be
adding any more options to the mix.

11:25.453 --> 11:27.253
- Well, if she's offering,
what's the problem?

11:27.255 --> 11:30.590
- Everything in here is like
one big, tacky blouse.

11:30.592 --> 11:33.593
- Oh, come on, that's silly.

11:33.595 --> 11:37.263
- Now, I know you men
like to play it safe,

11:37.265 --> 11:40.600
but I just thought,
why not shake it up?

11:40.602 --> 11:43.202
- Ugh!
- Oh, I like these!

11:43.204 --> 11:45.438
- Um...
- Hmm? Mhmm!

11:45.440 --> 11:47.840
- Are they durable?
- Oh well,

11:47.842 --> 11:50.776
durability a given here
at the "Blouse Barn."

11:50.778 --> 11:52.411
And if you're asking
my opinion...

11:52.413 --> 11:54.480
- Are we, though?

11:54.482 --> 11:55.915
- It's between these two.

11:57.919 --> 12:01.754
- Well, this is a real
"Sophie's Choice!"

12:01.756 --> 12:03.789
- I hope that you and Jocelyn
don't role play that at home.

12:03.791 --> 12:05.191
- Hell, we've played
every Streep movie.

12:05.193 --> 12:07.960
- Oh, okay.
- Um...

12:07.962 --> 12:10.663
Would you describe either
of those as "quick release?"

12:10.665 --> 12:13.299
- Funnily enough,
both have snaps.

12:13.301 --> 12:15.568
- Oh, great!

12:15.570 --> 12:18.871
Well, then I guess I um...

12:18.873 --> 12:21.540
Well...

12:21.542 --> 12:23.409
Uh, which one do you like?

12:27.281 --> 12:29.482
- I don't know,
it's such a tough choice.

12:29.484 --> 12:31.517
- Oh, you're tellin' me!

12:31.519 --> 12:33.285
- It's just that I'm finding
both of these options

12:33.287 --> 12:36.255
to be a little um...
- What?

12:36.257 --> 12:38.024
- Well, I don't know,
we've just spent so much time

12:38.026 --> 12:40.760
and energy finding the few
pieces that aren't um...

12:40.762 --> 12:44.130
- Uh...
- What?!

12:44.132 --> 12:46.032
- I'm trying to find the word
to describe what I--

12:46.034 --> 12:48.434
- Oh! Flirty? Sassy?

12:48.436 --> 12:51.637
- Skanky! I think the clothes
are a bit skanky.

12:51.639 --> 12:54.006
- Hmm.

12:54.008 --> 12:55.574
- Well! Skanky.

12:57.578 --> 12:59.945
- We'll um, take
the funereal skirt then,

13:02.016 --> 13:04.884
and the skanky blouse.

13:04.886 --> 13:07.153
RAY: And sold!
(Gavel bangs)

13:07.155 --> 13:09.822
To Johnny Rose, for the price
of $15 dollars!

13:09.824 --> 13:11.524
Which uh, I hope you can
afford.

13:11.526 --> 13:13.726
You know, considering
your financial situation.

13:13.728 --> 13:15.428
- Yeah, I get it Ray,
I get it. I get it.

13:15.430 --> 13:18.230
I've got cash, and I'd just
like my cufflinks, please.

13:18.232 --> 13:20.700
RAY: And now, moving on
to bedroom items.

13:20.702 --> 13:23.502
First we'll have a brand new
queen sized

13:23.504 --> 13:26.205
memory foam mattress.

13:26.207 --> 13:28.340
We'll start the bidding
on the bed at $50 dollars.

13:28.342 --> 13:30.676
We have $50!

13:30.678 --> 13:32.845
- $60!
- Moira.

13:32.847 --> 13:35.014
- Ssh!
- Ooh, I smell a bidding war!

13:35.016 --> 13:36.916
Do we have $70?
- $70!

13:36.918 --> 13:38.951
- $70! Do I have $75?

13:38.953 --> 13:41.387
- $75!
- Moira, what are you doing?

13:41.389 --> 13:43.089
- We are currently sleeping
on a rectangular collection

13:43.091 --> 13:44.290
of knives and barbed wire,
John.

13:44.292 --> 13:45.591
- $75, do we have $80?

13:45.593 --> 13:47.693
- $80!
- $80!

13:47.695 --> 13:49.895
- $90!
- Moira, we can't afford this!

13:49.897 --> 13:51.797
- You got the cufflinks!
- For $15 dollars!

13:51.799 --> 13:53.966
- $90! Do we have $100?
- $100!

13:53.968 --> 13:56.168
- $100!
- You just bid against yourself!

13:56.170 --> 13:58.304
RAY: Do I hear $105?

13:58.306 --> 13:59.839
- Do you remember what we used
to sleep on? Texas Kings!

13:59.841 --> 14:03.109
- $130!
- Wow, $130! Do I hear $135?

14:03.111 --> 14:05.111
- $140!
- $150!

14:05.113 --> 14:07.213
- $160!
- Moira, I'm begging you!

14:07.215 --> 14:09.181
- Oh, she has a decent bed,
John,

14:09.183 --> 14:09.982
she's just being greedy!
- $165, anyone?

14:09.984 --> 14:12.618
- $170!
- You did it again!

14:12.620 --> 14:14.153
- I know what I'm doing!
- $170! $180?

14:14.155 --> 14:15.654
- Ray, I think we're done here!
- $180!

14:15.656 --> 14:18.557
- $180! Do I hear $190?

14:18.559 --> 14:20.559
- One-nine... Two hundred!

14:20.561 --> 14:23.529
- $200! Wow, Mrs. Rose.

14:23.531 --> 14:26.232
You're really going for it,
which is surprising--

14:26.234 --> 14:29.034
- Yeah, Ray, you know what,
that was just a joke bid, so.

14:29.036 --> 14:30.903
- Oh, I understand.

14:30.905 --> 14:32.371
Unfortunately that joke bid
is currently our highest

14:32.373 --> 14:34.473
at $200 dollars!

14:34.475 --> 14:38.410
Going once, going twice,
- Two hundred and one!

14:38.412 --> 14:43.449
- $201 going once, going twice,
- Don't!

14:43.451 --> 14:47.153
- Sold, to Jocelyn Schitt,
for $201 dollars.

14:47.155 --> 14:48.788
- Fuck!

14:48.790 --> 14:50.356
(Truck rumbles)

14:53.561 --> 14:56.362
- Well, thank you for
this delightful trip.

14:56.364 --> 14:57.296
- You know, I'm starting to get
the feeling that uh,

14:57.298 --> 14:59.565
you're a little upset.

14:59.567 --> 15:01.300
- What would give you
that impression?

15:01.302 --> 15:03.369
- Well, I first noticed it
when Heart came on,

15:03.371 --> 15:06.972
and nobody was taking
the high parts.

15:06.974 --> 15:09.141
- Oh my God!
- Look you should feel good about yourself!

15:09.143 --> 15:11.811
Come on, you made some
great choices today.

15:11.813 --> 15:13.846
- Nothing we bought today
came anywhere close

15:13.848 --> 15:15.214
to something Meryl Streep
would wear

15:15.216 --> 15:17.082
in "The Devil Wears Prada,"
nothing!

15:17.084 --> 15:19.418
- Oh jeez, you are so touchy!

15:19.420 --> 15:22.755
God, you're like a-
a fancy dinner plate

15:22.757 --> 15:27.193
that you don't wanna nudge off
the edge of the table.

15:27.195 --> 15:29.128
- Okay, I don't know
what that means.

15:29.130 --> 15:31.163
Um listen, I don't have a lot
to my name right now,

15:31.165 --> 15:32.731
but I do have one thing.

15:32.733 --> 15:36.035
- Self-respect?
- No, taste.

15:36.037 --> 15:38.470
And when that is not
appreciated,

15:38.472 --> 15:42.908
or worse, publicly undermined,
publicly...

15:42.910 --> 15:45.044
uh yeah, I might get a little
upset.

15:45.046 --> 15:46.745
- Look, David- David!

15:46.747 --> 15:49.548
(Sighs) Listen.

15:49.550 --> 15:52.218
If I wasn't so easily swayed
by powerful women

15:52.220 --> 15:55.387
in a retail environment,
I would've been there for you.

15:55.389 --> 15:59.058
Okay, because I honestly
believe that really do

15:59.060 --> 16:00.659
have a very, very sharp eye.

16:04.098 --> 16:06.398
- Thank you, that's nice of you
to say.

16:06.400 --> 16:08.367
- Trust me, when Joc
sees this blouse,

16:08.369 --> 16:09.869
I'm gonna make sure
she knows you're the one

16:09.871 --> 16:11.303
that picked it out.
- I didn't pick that blouse.

16:11.305 --> 16:12.371
- I know, but I'm gonna tell
her you did.

16:12.373 --> 16:13.706
- Okay, thanks so much.

16:13.708 --> 16:15.140
(Truck rumbles)

16:19.547 --> 16:21.814
(Rattles)

16:21.816 --> 16:24.583
- This is ridiculous!
- This is how you learn.

16:24.585 --> 16:25.684
- Everyone is looking
at me, Mutt!

16:25.686 --> 16:27.586
- No one is looking at you!

16:27.588 --> 16:30.356
- Ugh!
- Is everything okay?

16:30.358 --> 16:32.825
People were saying that a girl
was struggling with her bike.

16:32.827 --> 16:34.994
I kinda just assumed
it was a toddler.

16:34.996 --> 16:37.229
- No, I am a grown adult
young woman.

16:37.231 --> 16:38.731
- Okay, this is how my dad
taught me,

16:38.733 --> 16:41.734
and this is how
I'm teaching you!

16:41.736 --> 16:44.169
- I'm glad I knew how to ride
a bike when we dated.

16:44.171 --> 16:45.437
- Yeah, I don't really trust
your dad in terms of like,

16:45.439 --> 16:48.474
"teachable moments."

16:48.476 --> 16:50.643
TWYLA: You know, one of my mom's
boyfriends had a really great trick.

16:50.645 --> 16:52.878
He used to say,
"One foot on the ground,

16:52.880 --> 16:55.681
one foot on the pedal,
now get the hell outta here!"

16:55.683 --> 16:57.549
- Hey, that's fun, I like that,
let's try that.

16:57.551 --> 16:59.184
- Okay fine, I'm just saying,

16:59.186 --> 17:00.419
if it's something you never
did before--

17:00.421 --> 17:03.122
- There you go!
- Okay, wait!

17:03.124 --> 17:06.325
- Are you coming, or do I just
keep like, driving straight?

17:06.327 --> 17:08.260
- I didn't teach you how
to brake yet!

17:08.262 --> 17:11.030
- Get the hell outta here,
you dumb broad!

17:11.032 --> 17:12.364
(Chuckles) That was another
thing he used to say.

17:17.972 --> 17:19.638
(Knocks)

17:25.112 --> 17:27.479
- Hey.
- Roland!

17:27.481 --> 17:30.015
- Johnny, um, do you have
a minute?

17:30.017 --> 17:31.417
- Yeah.
- Come here.

17:33.788 --> 17:35.754
- What's going on?

17:35.756 --> 17:37.790
- Well Johnny,
I'm about to make you

17:37.792 --> 17:41.160
the most popular guy in Room 6.

17:41.162 --> 17:42.962
- Is this the mattress?

17:42.964 --> 17:45.130
- Okay, yeah,
I've got a big heart,

17:45.132 --> 17:46.732
all right, don't spread it
around.

17:46.734 --> 17:50.269
I talked Jocelyn into
letting you have it.

17:50.271 --> 17:52.805
- You're giving us
the mattress?

17:52.807 --> 17:56.809
- Well, practically,
it's yours for $200 bucks.

17:56.811 --> 17:58.944
- That's a dollar less
than you paid for it!

17:58.946 --> 18:01.480
- Johnny, it's barely
out of the plastic.

18:01.482 --> 18:04.016
- We can't afford it.

18:04.018 --> 18:06.885
- Oh I see, you're the master
negotiator at work here, huh?

18:06.887 --> 18:09.655
Okay, um, $195.

18:09.657 --> 18:11.890
- We can't afford it!

18:11.892 --> 18:13.726
- Okay, hardball, huh?
I'll play.

18:13.728 --> 18:15.694
Um, $182.50.

18:15.696 --> 18:19.365
- All right, bye, Roland.
- Fifty bucks.

18:19.367 --> 18:21.500
- Fifty?

18:21.502 --> 18:25.504
- Look, I'll level with you,
okay?

18:25.506 --> 18:26.872
Um, we tried it out as soon
as Jocelyn brought it home.

18:30.144 --> 18:32.211
- You tried it out?

18:32.213 --> 18:33.679
- Yeah, not enough bounce
for the bumps,

18:33.681 --> 18:35.647
if you know what I mean.
-Hmm.

18:35.649 --> 18:37.783
- But given your advanced
years,

18:37.785 --> 18:40.486
it might just be the thing
for you and Moira.

18:40.488 --> 18:42.888
- Yeah well, we're not that
old...

18:42.890 --> 18:45.224
But $50?

18:48.262 --> 18:49.895
(Crickets chirp)

18:49.897 --> 18:52.097
MOIRA: Kudos to you, Mr. Rose.

18:52.099 --> 18:53.298
I can't believe
I'm saying this,

18:53.300 --> 18:55.801
but I'm so comfortable!

18:55.803 --> 18:59.038
- Well, only the best
for you, my dear.

18:59.040 --> 19:02.374
- Yet they didn't want it?

19:02.376 --> 19:05.444
- Oh, I think they just felt
sorry for us.

19:05.446 --> 19:07.980
- Well, that seems strange,
John.

19:07.982 --> 19:11.417
Especially since Jocelyn paid
over $200 for it.

19:11.419 --> 19:12.885
- You know what I think,
I think they tried it out,

19:12.887 --> 19:15.120
and uh, it just didn't
work for them.

19:19.960 --> 19:21.960
- And by tried it out,
you mean...

19:25.032 --> 19:27.366
- I mean they... tried it out.

19:29.103 --> 19:30.636
- Eww! Oh God! No! Oh! Oh!

19:34.141 --> 19:36.575
Oh God, that's memory foam,
John!

19:36.577 --> 19:38.944
- Oh Moira, we've stayed
at Kennedy compound,

19:38.946 --> 19:40.546
- Oh!
- This can't be any worse than that!

19:40.548 --> 19:42.247
- The Kennedys aren't Roland!

19:42.249 --> 19:44.850
The Kennedys have regular
medicals, daily laundering!

19:44.852 --> 19:47.186
- This has gotta be better
than the motel mattress

19:47.188 --> 19:51.023
we were using, I mean,
who knows who tried that out!

19:51.025 --> 19:53.158
- Is that supposed to be
helping me?!

19:53.160 --> 19:55.961
- Moira, this is a $50 dollar
gift from heaven.

19:55.963 --> 19:58.530
I mean, look, hey!

19:58.532 --> 20:01.900
I don't feel any springs,
no nails, no bolts!

20:01.902 --> 20:04.870
It's comfy, come to bed.

20:04.872 --> 20:06.505
- Tomorrow we get
a mattress cover.

20:06.507 --> 20:09.274
- Yes, yes, that's the spirit.

20:09.276 --> 20:10.576
- Oh...

20:13.214 --> 20:14.746
Oh!
- Mm!

20:17.218 --> 20:19.118
Ahh...

20:22.790 --> 20:23.589
Seriously, don't think
about it.

20:28.329 --> 20:29.495
ALEXIS: Okay, so you have
to keep it upright.

20:29.497 --> 20:30.963
- I don't even wanna do this!

20:30.965 --> 20:32.397
- David, you're gonna feel
so good, trust me.

20:32.399 --> 20:33.899
- Oh my God, you know
that I have bad

20:33.901 --> 20:35.467
foot-eye coordination,
you didn't have to wear

20:35.469 --> 20:37.603
corrective leg braces
for three months.

20:37.605 --> 20:39.805
- You can't blame everything on
having been pigeon-toed, David.

20:39.807 --> 20:41.240
- Oh my God! JOHNNY: Kids,
your mother and I are gonna--

20:41.242 --> 20:43.642
Oh my God, David,
what are you doing?!

20:43.644 --> 20:45.677
- I'm teaching him
how to ride a bike!

20:45.679 --> 20:48.080
- Oh please don't, you know I
can't stand the sight of blood.

20:48.082 --> 20:49.815
- Seriously son,
you're gonna hurt yourself!

20:49.817 --> 20:51.717
- David, it is one foot
on the pedal,

20:51.719 --> 20:53.552
and one foot on the ground, and
then get the hell out of here!

20:53.554 --> 20:54.820
Okay?
- I don't know what that means.

20:54.822 --> 20:56.655
- Okay, I'm gonna hold
the back.

20:56.657 --> 20:57.556
- Aah!
- He's coming, come on, come on!

20:57.558 --> 21:00.159
- Oh, okay- aah!
Aah! Aah!

21:00.161 --> 21:02.394
ALEXIS: David, the pedals make
it move more!

21:02.396 --> 21:04.730
- John, he's doing it!
- You're doing it, son!

21:07.902 --> 21:08.500
- Oh my God.

21:11.438 --> 21:13.405
- Yay! (Clapping)
- Woo hoo hoo!

21:13.407 --> 21:15.240
- Hey, someone get my camera!

21:15.242 --> 21:17.943
DAVID: Nobody get a camera!
STEVIE: David! Over here!

21:17.945 --> 21:18.744
(Camera clicks)
