WEBVTT

00:01.035 --> 00:02.570
Scrub in with The Resident.

00:02.603 --> 00:04.638
This is a business.
It's not a charity.

00:04.672 --> 00:06.574
Catch all-new episodes Mondays,

00:06.607 --> 00:08.542
and check out
our other Fox programs--

00:08.576 --> 00:11.912
9-1-1, Lethal Weapon,
and Empire.

00:11.945 --> 00:14.248
We lost Empire,
but we are still here.

00:14.282 --> 00:15.749
Only on Fox.

00:18.619 --> 00:20.154
-Previously on The Resident...
-No pulse.

00:20.188 --> 00:21.389
The strut in the valve
is shattered.

00:21.422 --> 00:22.990
MINA:
Seven QuoVadis heart valves.

00:23.023 --> 00:25.025
I want to put them
through the pulse duplicator.

00:25.059 --> 00:26.094
The valves aren't strong enough

00:26.127 --> 00:27.995
for a younger, active patient.

00:28.028 --> 00:30.198
Mark Truscott, FDA,
Product Regulation.

00:30.231 --> 00:33.267
I know that my firm is engaged
in a wide-ranging fraud.

00:33.301 --> 00:35.503
You are not a team player.

00:35.536 --> 00:37.004
(engine revving)

00:37.037 --> 00:38.772
-(horn honks)
-(screaming)

00:40.274 --> 00:42.110
NIC:
My sister, she OD'd on Oxy.

00:42.143 --> 00:44.078
You almost died today, Jess.

00:44.112 --> 00:45.079
You got to start making
better choices.

00:45.113 --> 00:47.181
So let's start now.

00:47.215 --> 00:48.949
-Go home!
-I can't.

00:48.982 --> 00:49.883
Priya's there.

00:49.917 --> 00:51.085
No wife and no home.

01:48.041 --> 01:51.679
Now, use your ears
as well as your eyes.

01:51.712 --> 01:55.015
You're more likely to hear
a bird before you see it.

01:55.048 --> 01:57.451
(bird calls)

01:58.486 --> 02:01.021
(whistling)

02:04.492 --> 02:06.994
Listen for the call
of a cerulean warbler.

02:07.027 --> 02:09.763
I saw one the last time
I brought a group to this spot.

02:09.797 --> 02:13.567
Most handsome
little blue fell...

02:14.635 --> 02:17.838
Hello, juvenile blue heron.

02:17.871 --> 02:21.675
And perhaps a wood duck as well.

02:23.711 --> 02:26.447
(siren wailing)

02:26.480 --> 02:28.982
(indistinct
police transmission)

02:30.251 --> 02:32.220
Swerved right off
the road there.

02:32.253 --> 02:34.255
(indistinct chatter)

02:36.190 --> 02:38.125
Ran the plates.

02:38.158 --> 02:39.893
Belong to a Julian Booth.

02:39.927 --> 02:41.161
(sighs)

02:41.195 --> 02:42.396
Open it up.

02:56.244 --> 02:58.546
Car's empty.

02:58.579 --> 03:02.283
Let's see if search and rescue
can find a body.

03:03.351 --> 03:05.353
Did you check the perimeter?

03:19.600 --> 03:21.835
Okay, one more thing.

03:21.869 --> 03:24.405
Last question, I promise.
Hoop or stud?

03:24.438 --> 03:26.206
Stud, hoop?

03:26.240 --> 03:28.942
You pick.
They're both great.

03:28.976 --> 03:30.844
You nervous?

03:30.878 --> 03:32.179
My first job interview
since rehab?

03:32.212 --> 03:33.514
Yeah.
(chuckles)

03:33.547 --> 03:36.717
I have your prep material.

03:36.750 --> 03:38.552
Partner CVs and briefs

03:38.586 --> 03:41.389
on high-profile cases
and clients at the firm.

03:41.422 --> 03:44.292
And what they're looking for
in a paralegal.

03:44.325 --> 03:46.059
Five hours till go time.

03:46.093 --> 03:49.963
Thank you so much
for putting that together, Nic.

03:49.997 --> 03:53.033
It's my pleasure.
This is exciting, Jess.

03:53.066 --> 03:56.069
This could be the beginning
of a whole new life for you.

03:56.103 --> 03:58.406
-Call me when it's done.
-I will. Yeah.

03:58.439 --> 04:01.375
-Good luck.
-Bye, thanks.

04:01.409 --> 04:02.976
(inhales)

04:03.010 --> 04:05.779
You need to pull
all QuoVadis valves now.

04:05.813 --> 04:07.981
Because of one resident's
science experiment?

04:08.015 --> 04:10.584
The valves worked fine when
simulated for older patients,

04:10.618 --> 04:12.986
but when I mimicked the blood
flow of active younger ones...

04:13.020 --> 04:15.956
-AUSTIN: Like Bradley.
-...they shattered like glass.

04:15.989 --> 04:18.091
Look, it's very clear
that a defective QuoVadis valve

04:18.125 --> 04:19.927
killed Bradley, not these hands.

04:19.960 --> 04:22.596
Well, your mentor, Abe Benedict,
swears by them.

04:22.630 --> 04:24.231
-Explain that.
-Easy.

04:24.264 --> 04:26.133
He's on the QuoVadis payroll.

04:26.166 --> 04:28.936
-What are you talking about?
-ProPublica.

04:28.969 --> 04:31.238
It's a site you need
to make your home page, Bell.

04:31.271 --> 04:33.907
They have a feature called
Dollars for Docs.

04:33.941 --> 04:36.109
It lists every dime
every doctor takes

04:36.143 --> 04:38.278
from medical device companies.

04:38.312 --> 04:41.649
Every dime to every doctor.

04:41.682 --> 04:45.319
Well, that-that...
that proves nothing.

04:45.353 --> 04:48.422
Billions of dollars are given to
doctors every year by industry.

04:48.456 --> 04:50.023
It's standard practice.

04:50.057 --> 04:52.092
MINA:
QuoVadis paid Dr. Benedict
a small fortune

04:52.125 --> 04:54.194
to push products
that kill people.

04:54.227 --> 04:56.930
Look, I know,
as a fellow surgeon,

04:56.964 --> 04:59.933
you are not gonna stand around
and allow our doctors

04:59.967 --> 05:04.204
to use products
that cause harm to our patients.

05:04.237 --> 05:07.007
Okay, well, uh,
here's how I want to proceed.

05:07.040 --> 05:10.844
I-I want to take you off
all high-risk procedures.

05:10.878 --> 05:13.447
-High-risk procedures
are my thing, Bell.
-I understand,

05:13.481 --> 05:15.716
but if you want to prove
it's the valve

05:15.749 --> 05:17.117
that caused Bradley's death,

05:17.150 --> 05:18.352
you need to keep
your record clean.

05:18.386 --> 05:19.887
You need to take
the easy layups,

05:19.920 --> 05:22.189
the bread and butter procedures.

05:22.222 --> 05:23.991
And while I do that?

05:24.024 --> 05:28.228
You have my word
I will look into this.

05:50.183 --> 05:51.485
(sighs)

05:51.519 --> 05:55.055
Here is your skinny latte.

05:57.190 --> 06:00.428
Get me a meeting with Gordon
Page. Tell him it's urgent.

06:05.132 --> 06:07.100
So?

06:07.134 --> 06:09.703
What's so urgent that it
required a face-to-face meeting?

06:09.737 --> 06:12.773
I received
some information today

06:12.806 --> 06:15.242
suggesting your heart valve
may be defective.

06:15.275 --> 06:16.944
Wh-What information? From where?

06:16.977 --> 06:18.846
Well, one of our doctors
tested the valve,

06:18.879 --> 06:21.381
and they're convinced
you have a significant problem.

06:21.415 --> 06:23.016
It may cause sudden death.

06:23.050 --> 06:25.052
Look, this is absurd.

06:25.085 --> 06:27.287
-We do all our own testing.
-Right.

06:28.622 --> 06:30.223
Have you done follow-ups
on patients

06:30.257 --> 06:32.059
that have received
QuoVadis valves?

06:32.092 --> 06:34.227
What's the mortality rate
at six months or a year?

06:34.261 --> 06:36.029
Naturally, some of them die

06:36.063 --> 06:39.066
due to underlying diseases
or surgical errors.

06:39.099 --> 06:40.601
Well, and some
device manufacturers

06:40.634 --> 06:42.369
use that fact
to hide device problems.

06:42.402 --> 06:44.104
Is that what you're implying?

06:44.137 --> 06:46.707
No, I'm-I'm-- no.
I'm not implying anything,

06:46.740 --> 06:49.076
but I want to see data
on the safety of the valves.

06:49.109 --> 06:50.611
And if it doesn't exist,

06:50.644 --> 06:52.446
QuoVadis has to pull them
from the market.

06:52.480 --> 06:54.414
I'm sorry, are you, are you
asking me to issue a recall

06:54.448 --> 06:56.149
during the run up to our IPO?

06:56.183 --> 06:57.250
Oh, yeah, while you do
more testing. Yes, yes.

06:57.284 --> 06:59.152
Okay. Yeah, um, okay. I've heard

06:59.186 --> 07:00.754
just about enough of this.

07:00.788 --> 07:03.256
You can't tell me
how to run my business.

07:03.290 --> 07:04.758
Who the hell
do you think you are?

07:04.792 --> 07:06.560
You came to me
desperate for money,

07:06.594 --> 07:07.961
so I made you an opinion leader.

07:07.995 --> 07:09.162
I put you on my board.

07:09.196 --> 07:10.964
I arranged speaking fees

07:10.998 --> 07:12.833
to get you out of whatever
trouble you were in.

07:12.866 --> 07:14.568
And I'm grateful.

07:14.602 --> 07:16.403
I asked no questions.
I asked nothing in return

07:16.436 --> 07:18.939
except for loyalty to me.

07:19.973 --> 07:22.676
And to our product.

07:22.710 --> 07:26.947
Ugh, this is an extremely
disappointing conversation.

07:26.980 --> 07:29.517
I made an investment in you.

07:29.550 --> 07:31.118
Earn it.

07:33.186 --> 07:34.722
(siren wailing in distance)

07:39.860 --> 07:41.962
Hey, Jess.
What are you doing here?

07:41.995 --> 07:45.132
Okay, all right, be honest:
do I look like a paralegal?

07:45.165 --> 07:47.535
Right? It's just an interview
at this point,

07:47.568 --> 07:50.470
but thank you. Wish me luck.

07:50.504 --> 07:52.906
Good luck.

07:54.675 --> 07:56.644
NIC:
Hey, I got your text. What's up?

07:56.677 --> 07:58.311
I just, I changed outfits
and I wanted to show you.

07:58.345 --> 07:59.980
This, this is better, right?

08:00.013 --> 08:00.981
What do you think?
It's-it's softer.

08:01.014 --> 08:02.482
It's more approachable.

08:02.516 --> 08:03.984
NIC:
Well, yeah, I like it
'cause it's mine,

08:04.017 --> 08:05.719
which you borrowed
without asking.

08:05.753 --> 08:07.154
What are you doing?
You're supposed to be

08:07.187 --> 08:08.956
at your interview.

08:08.989 --> 08:12.192
Oh, yes, and I missed the bus.
Can I borrow 20 bucks for a cab?

08:12.225 --> 08:14.862
-I'll pay you back. I promise.
-Yes, hurry up.

08:14.895 --> 08:17.330
I'm sorry.
You're the best sister ever.

08:17.364 --> 08:19.166
-I love you. Okay?
-(exhales) Got it.

08:19.199 --> 08:21.201
I'll call you after.

08:23.170 --> 08:25.338
Hey.

08:27.440 --> 08:31.712
She's very... happy.

08:31.745 --> 08:33.581
What's that supposed to mean?

08:33.614 --> 08:35.583
Opioids can cause euphoria.

08:35.616 --> 08:37.651
I-Is Jessie being tested?

08:37.685 --> 08:39.653
Unbelievable.

08:39.687 --> 08:43.190
First, I'm codependent,
now I'm not doing enough.

08:43.223 --> 08:45.392
Conrad, Jessie's fine.

08:45.425 --> 08:47.728
We're actually
in a really good place.

08:47.761 --> 08:50.463
Okay.

08:51.699 --> 08:54.167
AUSTIN:
Take a deep breath.

08:54.201 --> 08:57.404
Our time on this earth begins
and ends with a heartbeat.

08:57.437 --> 09:00.407
It is the first sign of life
within the womb,

09:00.440 --> 09:04.011
and it is the last organ
to stop functioning in death.

09:04.044 --> 09:06.947
ELOISE:
The best part is feeling
like you're actually there.

09:06.980 --> 09:09.717
AUSTIN:
Is it the seat of our emotions?
No.

09:09.750 --> 09:12.219
-Do I want you to be...
-Virtual reality lets me attend

09:12.252 --> 09:15.789
all my med school classes
and practice virtual surgeries.

09:15.823 --> 09:19.126
But I do miss seeing patients.

09:19.159 --> 09:21.128
Eh, new lungs could
change all that.

09:21.161 --> 09:23.430
You would finish
your fourth year of med school,

09:23.463 --> 09:25.432
maybe even come here
as an intern.

09:25.465 --> 09:27.935
I can't think
of anything more amazing.

09:27.968 --> 09:30.237
(coughing)

09:35.142 --> 09:37.044
Yeah, all right.
Here we go, here we go.

09:37.077 --> 09:39.246
(coughing)

09:39.279 --> 09:42.549
Take a big breath.
Blow it out forcefully, sweetie.

09:42.582 --> 09:45.485
Conrad, these are
Eloise's parents.

09:45.518 --> 09:48.656
Florence and Dan Camden,
this is Dr. Hawkins.

09:48.689 --> 09:52.726
-Hello.
-I've asked him
to do a complete workup.

09:52.760 --> 09:54.995
Before we can move forward,
we need to be certain Eloise

09:55.028 --> 09:57.397
is still healthy enough
for a double lung transplant.

09:57.430 --> 09:59.833
We heard the donor is already
here at Chastain.

09:59.867 --> 10:02.302
Can I ask who she is?

10:02.335 --> 10:03.603
KIT:
She's a young woman

10:03.637 --> 10:06.073
who died of an opioid overdose.

10:06.106 --> 10:09.076
That's awful.

10:09.109 --> 10:11.411
I'm sorry.
And here I am, so happy.

10:11.444 --> 10:13.413
Oh, it's okay.

10:13.446 --> 10:16.516
You can have sympathy for
the donor and still be grateful.

10:16.549 --> 10:18.518
Because the donor was an addict,

10:18.551 --> 10:20.420
there is a very small risk
of complications,

10:20.453 --> 10:22.022
but don't worry, the organs

10:22.055 --> 10:24.024
have been through testing
to ensure they're safe.

10:24.057 --> 10:25.793
FLORENCE:
When we thought a donor
might not come through,

10:25.826 --> 10:26.960
Dan and I were tested.

10:26.994 --> 10:28.495
We're both a match

10:28.528 --> 10:30.497
and we can each supply
a lobe of our own lungs.

10:30.530 --> 10:33.033
-Would that be better?
-ELOISE:
Mom, we've been through this.

10:33.066 --> 10:35.035
That would put
both of your lives at risk.

10:35.068 --> 10:38.605
I've lived with CF
all of my life.

10:38.638 --> 10:42.009
50 pills a day,
hours of breathing treatments.

10:42.042 --> 10:44.477
Dad works three jobs to pay
for all my medical bills.

10:44.511 --> 10:46.814
Mom has had
to take care of me 24/7.

10:46.847 --> 10:49.182
Uh-- they have suffered enough.

10:49.216 --> 10:51.985
The donor lungs are going
to work, I'm sure of it.

10:52.019 --> 10:54.221
(coughing)

11:08.902 --> 11:10.904
As you can no doubt tell,
this case is personal to me.

11:10.938 --> 11:13.907
I've been Eloise's med school
mentor since her first year.

11:13.941 --> 11:16.409
CONRAD:
Oh, she's frail, Kit.

11:16.443 --> 11:19.146
-I hope we're not too late.
-I know.

11:19.179 --> 11:21.915
Without new lungs,
she won't live another year.

11:21.949 --> 11:24.584
And that would break my heart.

11:24.617 --> 11:26.754
They found Julian's car.

11:26.787 --> 11:29.389
(newsman speaking indistinctly
on TV)

11:31.024 --> 11:35.395
NEWSMAN:
We now go live to the scene
of a breaking story.

11:35.428 --> 11:37.264
Earlier this morning
birdwatchers stumbled

11:37.297 --> 11:39.499
across a car submerged in water.

11:39.532 --> 11:41.534
It's registered
to a local woman, Julian Booth,

11:41.568 --> 11:43.003
who's been missing
for some time.

11:43.036 --> 11:45.038
Dive teams are now looking
for a body.

11:48.208 --> 11:50.811
(phone ringing)

11:52.913 --> 11:55.548
(groans)

11:59.152 --> 12:00.888
Hey, Conrad, what's up?

12:00.921 --> 12:03.490
They found Julian's car.

12:04.491 --> 12:06.359
Where?

12:06.393 --> 12:09.629
Pulled it out
of the Chattahoochee River.

12:11.631 --> 12:13.133
Did they find her body?

12:15.168 --> 12:17.170
(sighs)

12:18.105 --> 12:20.107
Still searching.

12:20.140 --> 12:22.042
Devon,

12:22.075 --> 12:24.812
she could have made it out of
the car. Until we know more...

12:24.845 --> 12:26.146
Then where is she?

12:26.179 --> 12:27.881
-Why haven't I heard from her?
-Look,

12:27.915 --> 12:30.951
no matter what happens,
we're all here for you.

12:30.984 --> 12:33.253
Whatever you need.

12:34.922 --> 12:37.624
Thanks for the call.

12:48.101 --> 12:49.769
How long have you been
in the hospital?

12:49.803 --> 12:51.338
Three weeks.

12:51.371 --> 12:54.174
I know you're scared,
but you're not alone.

12:54.207 --> 12:56.609
Look... that's me.

12:56.643 --> 12:58.812
I was diagnosed
with cystic fibrosis

12:58.846 --> 13:00.447
when I was six weeks old.

13:00.480 --> 13:03.650
I need a new heart.

13:03.683 --> 13:05.585
I heard. The nurses told me.

13:05.618 --> 13:06.987
I need new lungs.

13:07.020 --> 13:08.455
The doctors are gonna
help us both.

13:08.488 --> 13:09.689
(knocking on door)

13:09.722 --> 13:10.991
Eloise.

13:11.024 --> 13:12.792
Hi, guys.

13:12.826 --> 13:14.094
This is Jeannie.

13:14.127 --> 13:15.328
KIT:
Hello, Jeannie.

13:15.362 --> 13:17.130
Can we borrow Eloise
for a few minutes?

13:17.164 --> 13:18.698
Sure.

13:18.731 --> 13:20.968
-Will you come back?
-ELOISE: Absolutely.

13:26.139 --> 13:28.876
Let's take the limo, shall we?

13:34.181 --> 13:35.115
Where to?

13:35.148 --> 13:37.450
Your room.

13:37.484 --> 13:39.887
KIT:
Your parents want to hear
what we have to say.

13:44.324 --> 13:48.996
I think, somehow, I'm going to
need more oxygen to handle this.

13:49.029 --> 13:51.498
I don't like the look
on your faces.

13:51.531 --> 13:53.066
We have the results
of the tests.

13:53.100 --> 13:56.836
CONRAD:
Unfortunately, your
previous labs have worsened.

13:56.870 --> 13:59.472
You now have extremely
elevated liver enzymes,

13:59.506 --> 14:02.042
clotting factors,
and blood sugar levels.

14:02.075 --> 14:03.977
ELOISE:
Okay, I've been in med school
long enough

14:04.011 --> 14:05.145
to know what that means.

14:05.178 --> 14:09.182
I'm no longer eligible
for a lung transplant.

14:09.216 --> 14:11.184
KIT:
Usually, that would be the case,

14:11.218 --> 14:14.421
but we've found
a potential solution.

14:14.454 --> 14:17.357
A lung, liver and pancreas
transplant.

14:17.390 --> 14:19.026
ELOISE:
A triple transplant?

14:19.059 --> 14:20.360
How did this happen?

14:20.393 --> 14:23.396
(sighs) Eloise's cystic fibrosis
has caused liver failure

14:23.430 --> 14:26.399
and pancreatic insufficiency, on
top of her respiratory failure.

14:26.433 --> 14:31.171
A triple transplant...
sounds impossible.

14:31.204 --> 14:35.342
It's dangerous, rare,
but not impossible.

14:35.375 --> 14:38.178
This operation has been done
successfully before.

14:38.211 --> 14:39.546
How many times?

14:39.579 --> 14:42.149
Once, in Canada.

14:49.622 --> 14:51.858
Without this surgery,
how long do I have?

14:51.891 --> 14:53.961
Not long, Eloise.

14:53.994 --> 14:56.729
Weeks?

14:56.763 --> 14:59.766
Maybe a little bit more.

15:07.407 --> 15:10.243
-It's okay.
-(Florence crying)

15:10.277 --> 15:12.779
-This isn't over.
-DAN: Mm-hmm.

15:12.812 --> 15:16.583
We know what we have to do.

15:16.616 --> 15:19.452
Can we get all three organs
from the donor we already have?

15:21.121 --> 15:22.956
Yes.

15:25.758 --> 15:27.927
Now, we just have to convince
the ethics committee.

15:27.961 --> 15:29.196
Kit?

15:42.675 --> 15:44.277
Come here.

15:52.785 --> 15:54.287
You okay?

15:54.321 --> 15:56.323
No.

15:57.524 --> 15:59.226
This is awful.

16:00.227 --> 16:03.863
I put a brave face on it
for the family.

16:03.896 --> 16:06.366
Oh, but, my God, Conrad.

16:06.399 --> 16:09.036
Where in the world are we gonna
find a surgeon

16:09.069 --> 16:11.004
crazy enough to even
take this on?

16:13.173 --> 16:14.641
A triple transplant?

16:14.674 --> 16:16.276
Dr. Austin can't do it.
Bell assigned him

16:16.309 --> 16:17.677
to low-risk surgeries.

16:17.710 --> 16:18.945
We've been doing stents
all morning.

16:18.978 --> 16:20.880
And you know
I am royally sick of it.

16:20.913 --> 16:23.283
This quarterback is coming
off the bench.

16:23.316 --> 16:25.552
There's no way.

16:25.585 --> 16:28.155
Please, Randolph, as a friend,
just hear me out.

16:28.188 --> 16:29.822
This is deeply important to me.

16:29.856 --> 16:31.991
It's bad for Austin.
It's bad for Chastain.

16:32.025 --> 16:33.826
I mean, I mean,
it looks like a--

16:33.860 --> 16:35.328
just a crazy publicity stunt,

16:35.362 --> 16:37.197
and the ethics committee
will never allow it.

16:37.230 --> 16:40.067
You chair the committee, you can
persuade them. I'll help.

16:40.100 --> 16:41.668
-We can double-team them.
-Kit, I'm-I'm sorry.

16:41.701 --> 16:43.236
I--
It's-it's out of the question.

16:43.270 --> 16:46.473
You go ahead and try
if you'd like.

16:46.506 --> 16:48.108
But I-- I can't help you
on this one.

16:58.385 --> 17:00.720
(sighs)

17:15.135 --> 17:17.504
Mr. and Mrs. Basilico?

17:17.537 --> 17:18.871
(chuckles)
How are you doing?

17:18.905 --> 17:21.074
Nicolette Nevin. Aw...

17:21.108 --> 17:23.743
Jessie's older sister.
Do you remember, Eric?

17:23.776 --> 17:26.413
Of course.
You had blue hair.

17:26.446 --> 17:30.283
I did. Teen years.
How's Letty?

17:33.820 --> 17:37.757
Maybe you'd like to see her.

17:37.790 --> 17:40.360
ERIC:
She's gone, Nic.

17:40.393 --> 17:43.430
Multiple doctors confirmed.

17:43.463 --> 17:45.098
They're keeping her on the vent

17:45.132 --> 17:47.267
because she wanted to be
an organ donor.

17:47.300 --> 17:51.070
Apparently, she's donating
to a young woman here.

17:51.104 --> 17:53.873
What happened?

17:53.906 --> 17:56.709
ERIC:
Opioid overdose.

17:56.743 --> 17:57.710
She's struggled with addiction

17:57.744 --> 17:59.379
since her senior year
in high school.

17:59.412 --> 18:02.982
I know that Letty tore her ACL
at the state championship.

18:03.015 --> 18:06.819
Yeah, and her doctor
gave her Oxy.

18:06.853 --> 18:08.321
They were handing it out
to everybody.

18:08.355 --> 18:10.657
I know.

18:10.690 --> 18:12.225
DINA:
She never really got sober,

18:12.259 --> 18:15.162
although we thought she did.

18:15.195 --> 18:18.131
I really thought
she'd make it this time.

18:18.165 --> 18:20.800
I didn't see any signs
she was using.

18:22.169 --> 18:23.336
I did.

18:25.037 --> 18:28.175
She wasn't eating much,
she'd lost weight.

18:28.208 --> 18:30.243
Her moods were
all over the place.

18:30.277 --> 18:33.280
She'd be anxious, on edge,

18:33.313 --> 18:35.648
and then she'd be up, so up.

18:35.682 --> 18:39.186
DINA (huffs):
Why didn't you say anything?

18:41.188 --> 18:43.156
I didn't want to see it.

18:44.991 --> 18:47.827
(Dina sobs)

19:14.587 --> 19:15.955
What are you doing?

19:15.988 --> 19:18.157
What'd you do with the money
I gave you, Jess?

19:18.191 --> 19:19.226
I told you, I used it for a cab.

19:19.259 --> 19:20.960
You're lying.

19:20.993 --> 19:22.729
Did you even go
to that job interview?

19:22.762 --> 19:25.632
So what if I didn't?
Whole thing was your idea.

19:25.665 --> 19:27.033
I don't want to be a paralegal.

19:28.435 --> 19:31.037
Stop going through my stuff,
Nic. Hey, quit it!

19:31.070 --> 19:33.139
Quit lying to me!
I know you're using.

19:33.172 --> 19:34.974
-God, I've been so stupid.
-You are insane.

19:35.007 --> 19:35.975
You know that?
Completely insane.

19:36.008 --> 19:38.411
I am not the problem here,
you are.

19:38.445 --> 19:41.080
Hey! Give me that,
you controlling bitch!

19:41.113 --> 19:43.650
(both panting)

19:43.683 --> 19:47.587
Okay, I know what you think,
but it's not true, okay?

19:47.620 --> 19:50.089
I-I keep these
in case I need them.

19:50.122 --> 19:51.190
Stop. Just stop!

19:51.224 --> 19:53.760
There is a huge amount
of pressure on me.

19:53.793 --> 19:56.028
And you are in my face
day and night.

19:56.062 --> 19:59.065
So, yes, I-I took a few.
Sometimes, okay?

19:59.098 --> 20:02.034
Be-Because of you!
Y-You are driving me crazy!

20:02.068 --> 20:04.203
This is my fault?

20:04.237 --> 20:07.206
Unbelievable. Yeah, it's always
my fault with you, Jessie, huh?

20:07.240 --> 20:11.210
Oh, poor little Nic.
Always a victim.

20:12.745 --> 20:15.382
Jessie-- Jessie, stop.
Listen to me.

20:15.415 --> 20:17.016
You are using,
and you are in trouble.

20:17.049 --> 20:18.985
(Nic panting)

20:20.787 --> 20:23.222
Remember your friend Letty
from high school?

20:23.256 --> 20:26.526
She's at Chastain, Jess.

20:26.559 --> 20:30.397
She's dead because she OD'd.

20:30.430 --> 20:31.531
I don't want that to be you.

20:31.564 --> 20:33.966
-No.
-It's true.

20:34.000 --> 20:36.569
Come with me to Chastain.
I'll show you.

20:39.171 --> 20:41.240
I don't believe you.

20:43.009 --> 20:44.977
Fine. Fine.

20:45.011 --> 20:48.315
Either way, pack your bags,

20:48.348 --> 20:51.384
'cause you're going to rehab.

20:51.418 --> 20:52.552
I'm not going anywhere.

20:52.585 --> 20:54.287
(sighs)

20:54.321 --> 20:56.656
(catching breath)

20:58.525 --> 21:00.960
Then get out.

21:03.195 --> 21:05.398
Get out.

21:05.432 --> 21:08.234
I'm done, Jess.

21:08.267 --> 21:11.571
I'm done trying to save you.
I'm done enabling.

21:11.604 --> 21:14.073
I'm done worrying.

21:14.106 --> 21:16.443
That's enough.

21:16.476 --> 21:21.914
And if you die...
I won't feel guilty...

21:21.948 --> 21:25.184
'cause I gave you every chance.

21:25.217 --> 21:27.286
So, here, you want your pills?

21:27.320 --> 21:30.022
You need them that bad?
Take 'em.

21:30.056 --> 21:31.824
Take 'em, Jess.

21:31.858 --> 21:33.526
I can't stop you
from killing yourself

21:33.560 --> 21:35.495
if that's what you want.

21:35.528 --> 21:37.530
(panting)

21:42.402 --> 21:44.404
(sighs)

21:48.341 --> 21:51.210
When I come home,
I don't want to find you here.

22:04.223 --> 22:07.360
(sobbing)

22:18.104 --> 22:20.373
(crying)

22:32.519 --> 22:36.088
-Can I help you?
-Yeah, I'm a friend of Julian's.

22:36.122 --> 22:38.391
Tell her she's a week
behind on her rent.

22:38.425 --> 22:40.059
She's not returning my calls.

22:40.092 --> 22:42.529
Um, when was the last time
you saw her?

22:42.562 --> 22:44.063
I don't know. Over a week.

22:44.096 --> 22:46.165
She left the cat all alone.

22:46.198 --> 22:48.501
I've been feeding it,
but it's driving me crazy.

22:48.535 --> 22:50.603
I bet.

22:50.637 --> 22:52.839
That's actually why I'm here.

22:52.872 --> 22:54.707
Julian asked me
to come pick up the cat, but

22:54.741 --> 22:56.843
I forgot her key.

22:56.876 --> 22:59.879
If you let me in,
I can take the cat home with me.

23:08.488 --> 23:10.056
Here's the key.

23:10.089 --> 23:12.592
Thank you.

23:17.464 --> 23:19.466
(cat meows)

23:37.083 --> 23:39.085
(cat meowing)

23:47.860 --> 23:49.996
-(meows)
-(chuckles)

24:16.388 --> 24:17.957
All set.

24:17.990 --> 24:20.459
-Thank you.
-(meows)

24:20.493 --> 24:23.129
Hey.

24:23.162 --> 24:25.031
Come on.

24:25.064 --> 24:28.768
This, my friends, is
what you call a paracentesis.

24:28.801 --> 24:31.437
It's pretty gross.
Look left, and you can see

24:31.470 --> 24:34.674
Dr. Hawkins is removing fluid
that's collected in my abdomen.

24:34.707 --> 24:37.176
(coughing)

24:38.310 --> 24:40.980
You don't have
to stream this, Eloise.

24:41.013 --> 24:43.315
People want
to know how I'm doing.

24:43.349 --> 24:45.985
I've live-streamed all
my procedures for the last year

24:46.018 --> 24:48.354
to med students and
the cystic fibrosis community.

24:48.387 --> 24:52.458
As you can see,
my belly is shrinking.

24:52.491 --> 24:54.561
Maybe I'll finally get some abs.

24:54.594 --> 24:58.965
It also means that
I'm in severe liver failure.

24:58.998 --> 25:01.467
I came in thinking
I was getting some lungs.

25:01.500 --> 25:04.503
Now, we've learned that I need
a new liver and pancreas.

25:04.537 --> 25:07.674
(coughing)

25:07.707 --> 25:10.743
So, I will have a triple
transplant and make history.

25:10.777 --> 25:12.745
Okay. Feel better?

25:12.779 --> 25:16.082
-Yeah. Thank you, Dr. Hawkins.
-My pleasure.

25:16.115 --> 25:18.818
Oh.

25:18.851 --> 25:21.821
Dr. Austin and Dr. Okafor
are gonna be your surgeons.

25:21.854 --> 25:25.825
Wow. We are honored.

25:25.858 --> 25:28.327
It's Dr. AJ Austin in the flesh!

25:28.360 --> 25:29.428
(Conrad chuckles)

25:29.461 --> 25:31.330
ELOISE:
I love your lectures.

25:31.363 --> 25:33.032
Thank you.

25:33.065 --> 25:34.033
"Our time on this earth

25:34.066 --> 25:36.869
begins and ends..."
(coughing)

25:39.238 --> 25:41.574
And ends with a heartbeat.

25:41.608 --> 25:43.009
(coughing)

25:43.042 --> 25:44.744
MINA:
Hi, Eloise.

25:44.777 --> 25:46.946
I have a consent form
for you to read.

25:46.979 --> 25:49.548
After the surgery, you'll be
on dozens of new drugs.

25:49.582 --> 25:52.418
I'm sure you have concerns
about rejection and...

25:52.451 --> 25:55.221
I may have a chest tube,
breathing tube, feeding tubes,

25:55.254 --> 25:59.626
Foley catheter, and central line
for weeks, maybe months.

25:59.659 --> 26:01.728
But I've got a life to live.

26:01.761 --> 26:04.196
-I just have one question.
-MINA: Mm-hmm.

26:04.230 --> 26:06.866
Can we livestream my surgery
to med students?

26:06.899 --> 26:08.134
MINA:
Uh...

26:08.167 --> 26:09.636
Not the best idea,

26:09.669 --> 26:11.203
under these circumstances.

26:11.237 --> 26:13.439
ELOISE:
But... since it's so rare,

26:13.472 --> 26:16.876
whether I live or die, isn't
there a lot to learn from this?

26:16.909 --> 26:18.044
AUSTIN:
Tell you what.

26:18.077 --> 26:19.946
We'll talk to the bigwigs.

26:19.979 --> 26:22.915
And for the record...
I'm cool with it.

26:22.949 --> 26:23.983
(Eloise chuckles)

26:24.016 --> 26:26.052
CONRAD:
Okay.

26:26.085 --> 26:27.787
Hang tight.
We're getting close.

26:27.820 --> 26:31.057
Just one more hurdle left
to cross: the ethics committee.

26:31.090 --> 26:32.258
Ah...

26:32.291 --> 26:33.726
Look, we can keep going

26:33.760 --> 26:34.961
around and around
about this all day,

26:34.994 --> 26:36.262
but the problem is,

26:36.295 --> 26:37.930
two lungs, a liver,
and a pancreas

26:37.964 --> 26:39.932
could go to four people
instead of just one,

26:39.966 --> 26:42.234
all of whom have a far better
chance of survival.

26:42.268 --> 26:44.436
This is an exceptional person.

26:44.470 --> 26:47.907
She's a top medical student
who'll make a great doctor.

26:47.940 --> 26:49.241
We understand how you feel.

26:49.275 --> 26:51.944
But all of our patients
are equally deserving.

26:51.978 --> 26:53.079
CONRAD:
Of course they are.

26:53.112 --> 26:54.313
And the other candidates
will get organs, too,

26:54.346 --> 26:56.015
just not from this donor.
They'll have to wait

26:56.048 --> 26:57.984
a little longer, but
they'll still be next in line.

26:58.017 --> 27:00.519
You're talking about
a five percent success rate.

27:00.552 --> 27:03.622
These odds may be long,
but they are not impossible.

27:03.656 --> 27:05.191
And it doesn't account
for variables,

27:05.224 --> 27:07.660
-like the skill of the surgeons.
-KIT: Eloise started a nonprofit

27:07.694 --> 27:09.962
to empower children
with disabilities.

27:09.996 --> 27:11.664
She works for access
to medications

27:11.698 --> 27:13.465
for those who can't afford them.

27:13.499 --> 27:14.867
She's touched so many lives.

27:14.901 --> 27:16.135
CONRAD:
Dr. Bell, we're deadlocked.

27:16.168 --> 27:17.303
This is up to you,

27:17.336 --> 27:19.972
and you are worried
if this doesn't succeed,

27:20.006 --> 27:22.775
it will be a blow
to Chastain's reputation.

27:22.809 --> 27:24.510
But no matter what,
we advance science

27:24.543 --> 27:26.813
and we open new possibilities
for thousands in the future

27:26.846 --> 27:29.949
who could benefit
from this kind of surgery.

27:29.982 --> 27:32.151
KIT:
We can't just give up
and say it's too difficult.

27:32.184 --> 27:35.587
It will never be possible
if we don't try.

27:38.190 --> 27:40.326
(exhales)

27:46.532 --> 27:48.500
KIT:
I remember a surgeon

27:48.534 --> 27:50.202
who took on
the toughest surgeries

27:50.236 --> 27:51.570
in the state of Georgia.

27:51.603 --> 27:53.572
Who gave hope
to people who had none.

27:53.605 --> 27:54.974
Who had no fear.

27:55.007 --> 27:57.744
He would have jumped
at the chance

27:57.777 --> 28:01.213
to advance the science
and make medical history.

28:11.623 --> 28:13.192
We are taking
a really big risk here.

28:14.927 --> 28:17.029
But we are gonna try
to save this life.

28:24.036 --> 28:25.504
AUSTIN: No second chance
when it comes to

28:25.537 --> 28:27.206
a Donation after Cardiac Death.
When that heart stops,

28:27.239 --> 28:29.008
those organs stop getting
perfused with blood

28:29.041 --> 28:31.010
and quickly become unusable.

28:31.043 --> 28:34.246
When we hit that OR, we got to
be lightning fast to save them.

28:37.083 --> 28:40.186
I thought no surgery
could scare me anymore,

28:40.219 --> 28:41.888
but my heart is
in my throat this time.

28:44.723 --> 28:46.793
(monitor flatlines)

28:50.897 --> 28:52.564
JESSICA:
Letty's heart has stopped.

28:52.598 --> 28:54.433
AUSTIN:
All right, let's get
this show on the road.

28:54.466 --> 28:55.768
BELL:
No, not so fast.

28:55.802 --> 28:57.436
We still have the five-minute
buffer to make sure

28:57.469 --> 28:58.805
-the heart's actually stopped.
-MINA: I think Dr. Austin

28:58.838 --> 29:00.807
is aware of the IOM guidelines.

29:00.840 --> 29:03.309
Just a reminder
to do the right thing.

29:13.152 --> 29:14.620
Let's dance.

29:16.923 --> 29:18.925
CONRAD:
Luckily, the Raptor's fearless.

29:18.958 --> 29:20.993
Thank God.
We need his courage.

29:21.027 --> 29:22.661
-AUSTIN: Sternal saw.
-BELL: 10 blade.

29:30.202 --> 29:32.138
BELL AND AUSTIN:
Catheter.

29:33.505 --> 29:34.506
BELL AND AUSTIN:
Cannulate.

29:34.540 --> 29:35.641
JESSICA:
Preservation fluids.

29:35.674 --> 29:37.209
AUSTIN:
Fast and furious, baby.

29:44.783 --> 29:46.118
BELL:
Checking the liver...

29:46.152 --> 29:48.287
and the pancreas.

29:48.320 --> 29:51.123
They both look viable. Yours?

29:52.825 --> 29:54.360
Lungs are not viable.

29:54.393 --> 29:57.029
There's black discoloration.
A rare complication.

29:57.063 --> 30:00.466
The nodules must not have been
detected during imaging.

30:00.499 --> 30:03.169
(sighs)
We can't use these lungs.

30:05.304 --> 30:07.206
BELL:
We're done.

30:14.813 --> 30:16.048
Remove the liver and pancreas.

30:16.082 --> 30:17.950
Put them on ice.

30:17.984 --> 30:19.685
There's another option.

30:23.722 --> 30:25.157
This can't be over
before it starts.

30:25.191 --> 30:26.692
It's not.
You've already been established

30:26.725 --> 30:28.194
as lung donor matches.

30:28.227 --> 30:30.129
We are gonna use a lobe of lung
from each of you

30:30.162 --> 30:31.998
and the liver and pancreas
we just procured.

30:34.033 --> 30:36.668
-If you agree.
-Of course,

30:36.702 --> 30:38.137
but she'll only have
two lobes of lung.

30:38.170 --> 30:39.906
CONRAD:
All she needs
is two lobes of lung.

30:39.939 --> 30:41.740
And they will expand over time.

30:41.773 --> 30:43.209
Better than her diseased ones.

30:43.242 --> 30:44.877
CONRAD:
Much better
than her diseased ones.

30:44.911 --> 30:46.678
But they haven't been prepped
for surgery.

30:46.712 --> 30:48.414
They haven't fasted, they could
aspirate when they go under.

30:48.447 --> 30:50.883
Anesthesia can do
a rapid sequence intubation

30:50.917 --> 30:52.684
to limit the risk of aspiration.

30:52.718 --> 30:54.153
Let's get you both to pre-op.

30:54.186 --> 30:55.888
If we don't move forward,

30:55.922 --> 30:57.656
we may never have
another opportunity like this.

30:57.689 --> 31:00.359
You're our daughter, Elo.

31:00.392 --> 31:03.062
The board has agreed
to livestream the surgery,

31:03.095 --> 31:05.064
but only to Eloise's
med school classmates,

31:05.097 --> 31:07.033
-just a limited feed.
-AUSTIN: Like she said,

31:07.066 --> 31:09.001
no matter what, it will be
a great learning tool.

31:09.035 --> 31:10.536
This just went
from an incredible long shot

31:10.569 --> 31:12.171
to virtually impossible.

31:12.204 --> 31:14.006
Well, then,
we'd better work a miracle.

31:14.040 --> 31:16.208
There's an entire family
in there counting on us.

31:18.210 --> 31:20.179
Hey, I'm on call for thoracic.

31:20.212 --> 31:21.213
Said you guys could use a hand.

31:21.247 --> 31:22.248
Welcome to the team, bro.

31:34.260 --> 31:36.195
(monitor beeping steadily)

31:36.228 --> 31:38.030
MINA:
Hmm.

31:38.064 --> 31:40.232
Diseased liver
and pancreas removed.

31:40.266 --> 31:42.168
So far, so good.

31:44.770 --> 31:47.573
BELL:
Donor liver and pancreas,
ready for implantation.

31:59.285 --> 32:01.453
Mom and Dad are stable.

32:01.487 --> 32:04.090
Here we go.

32:10.596 --> 32:12.131
How many people
are watching this?

32:12.164 --> 32:13.799
Not many.

32:13.832 --> 32:15.968
Probably just the gunners.

32:16.002 --> 32:18.137
(laughter)

32:29.148 --> 32:31.083
(door opens)

32:31.117 --> 32:33.119
JESSICA:
They're finishing
the liver and pancreas.

32:33.152 --> 32:35.021
We need the right lower lobe
of lung.

32:35.054 --> 32:37.089
NOLAN:
The lobe's harder to remove
than we expected.

32:37.123 --> 32:40.993
Mom has some adhesions
to the chest wall. Stapler.

32:46.032 --> 32:48.434
Transecting
the segmental branches

32:48.467 --> 32:50.002
off the pulmonary artery.

32:51.837 --> 32:54.373
Get Dr. Austin. Now!

32:54.406 --> 32:56.142
(monitor beeping rapidly)

33:05.084 --> 33:07.986
One order of lung to go.

33:10.156 --> 33:12.124
-Mom's crashing. They need you.
-Get this to Okafor

33:12.158 --> 33:13.625
and Bell to implant.

33:13.659 --> 33:15.761
Page Dr. Weiss,
tell her to come close up.

33:17.229 --> 33:19.065
Have we activated
massive transfusion protocol?

33:19.098 --> 33:22.134
NOLAN:
Yes. I've been trying
to repair the pulmonary artery,

33:22.168 --> 33:23.302
but the damage is extensive.

33:23.335 --> 33:26.172
AUSTIN:
Artery forceps to me.

33:37.549 --> 33:40.752
Dr. Austin needs you
to implant the lung.

33:40.786 --> 33:42.588
-Where's Dr. Austin?
-He's helping with the mom.

33:42.621 --> 33:44.356
-She's bleeding out.
-What?

33:44.390 --> 33:45.757
You stay. I'll go.

33:57.936 --> 33:59.205
(monitor beeping rapidly)

33:59.238 --> 34:00.506
BELL:
What's happening?

34:00.539 --> 34:02.040
It's impossible to see anything.

34:02.074 --> 34:03.775
We need to convert to open.

34:03.809 --> 34:05.144
10 blade.

34:06.145 --> 34:08.247
Retractor to Bell.

34:10.582 --> 34:13.119
Put your finger
on that proximal P.A.

34:14.120 --> 34:16.688
Getting the lung
out of the field

34:16.722 --> 34:18.457
will give us a better view.

34:18.490 --> 34:21.660
Looks like the lobe got damaged.

34:22.994 --> 34:25.231
Implant the lung with Mina.
I'll fix the bleed.

34:28.634 --> 34:32.204
3-0 Prolene.

34:32.238 --> 34:34.473
On my mark, let go
and I'll sew this up.

34:34.506 --> 34:36.208
-You ready?
-NOLAN: Yeah.

34:36.242 --> 34:38.644
BELL:
Go.

34:38.677 --> 34:40.011
Suction. Lap.

34:42.848 --> 34:45.050
Had to check on a patient.

34:45.083 --> 34:47.586
-How we doing?
-Florence lost a lot of blood.

34:47.619 --> 34:50.055
-They're working to save her.
-Eloise?

34:50.088 --> 34:52.758
They're putting in Florence's
right lower lobe now,

34:52.791 --> 34:55.327
but it may be damaged.

34:55.361 --> 34:56.962
(groans)

34:56.995 --> 34:59.831
Eloise can't live
with only one lobe.

35:02.668 --> 35:04.670
Dad's lobe on the left
looks good.

35:04.703 --> 35:07.439
Mom's lobe on the right shows
some contusions.

35:07.473 --> 35:09.608
Let's hope this works.

35:09.641 --> 35:12.644
MINA:
Dr. Chu, get the Ambu bag.

35:12.678 --> 35:14.680
("Maps" by Freya Ridings
playing)

35:16.014 --> 35:18.184
* Pack up

35:18.217 --> 35:20.085
CHU:
Inflating the lungs.

35:20.118 --> 35:21.587

35:21.620 --> 35:23.021
The moment of truth.

35:26.692 --> 35:29.661
* Oh, say,

35:29.695 --> 35:32.964
* Oh, say, say, say...

35:32.998 --> 35:34.833
AUSTIN:
Again.

35:34.866 --> 35:37.703
* They don't love you
like I love you *

35:37.736 --> 35:40.105
* Wait, they don't love you...

35:40.138 --> 35:41.707
Again.

35:41.740 --> 35:43.542
I'm getting a lot of resistance.

35:43.575 --> 35:46.144
-Is something wrong
with the tube?
-CHU: No, no, I checked.

35:46.178 --> 35:47.513
Maybe it's reperfusion injury.

35:47.546 --> 35:51.283
* Wait, they don't love you
like I love you... *

35:51.317 --> 35:53.852
-We should check her airway.
-All you.

35:53.885 --> 35:56.688
* Made off

35:56.722 --> 35:59.358
* Don't stray

35:59.391 --> 36:04.530
* My kind's your kind

36:04.563 --> 36:09.167
* I'll stay the same

36:09.201 --> 36:11.970
* Pack up

36:12.003 --> 36:14.139
* Don't stray...

36:14.172 --> 36:16.542
Hmm. Plug at the carina.

36:16.575 --> 36:18.910
* Say, say, oh, say, say...

36:18.944 --> 36:20.579
Got it, try again.

36:20.612 --> 36:23.181
* Wait

36:23.215 --> 36:26.017
* They don't love you
like I love you... *

36:26.051 --> 36:27.919
AUSTIN:
Fingers crossed.

36:27.953 --> 36:30.356
* They don't love you
like I love you *

36:30.389 --> 36:35.227
* Maps

36:35.261 --> 36:37.062
* Wait

36:37.095 --> 36:41.767
* They don't love you
like I love you, wait *

36:41.800 --> 36:44.035
(cheering, applause)

36:44.069 --> 36:46.338
* Wait

36:46.372 --> 36:50.108
* They don't love you
like I love you *

36:50.141 --> 36:54.045
* Maps

36:54.079 --> 36:59.385
* Wait, they don't love you
like I love you *

36:59.418 --> 37:03.121
* Wait, they don't
love you like I love you *

37:03.154 --> 37:05.957
* Wait

37:05.991 --> 37:09.295
* They don't love you
like I love you... *

37:09.328 --> 37:12.130
Mom's not out of the woods yet.

37:12.163 --> 37:13.432
You go, I'll close.

37:13.465 --> 37:16.167
* Wait

37:17.736 --> 37:20.406
* Pack up

37:20.439 --> 37:23.442
* Don't stray

37:23.475 --> 37:26.478
* Enough.

37:34.185 --> 37:36.187
(monitor beeping steadily)

37:38.824 --> 37:42.894
(inhales, exhales)

37:42.928 --> 37:46.164
-(sniffles)
-KIT: How do you feel?

37:46.197 --> 37:47.799
(exhales)

37:47.833 --> 37:51.403
Like I was just born.

37:51.437 --> 37:54.906
Like I'm the luckiest person
in the world.

37:54.940 --> 37:58.410
It's never been like this, ever,

37:58.444 --> 38:01.046
just breathing.

38:03.148 --> 38:04.916
My parents?

38:04.950 --> 38:06.452
Hey, Elo.

38:06.485 --> 38:08.253
CONRAD:
Your dad's procedure went great.

38:08.286 --> 38:11.122
Your mom...

38:11.156 --> 38:14.125
There were some complications
with the pulmonary artery.

38:14.159 --> 38:17.162
It can happen in difficult
surgeries like this.

38:17.195 --> 38:20.098
-Recovery's not gonna be easy.
-MINA: But...

38:20.131 --> 38:21.867
we believe she can make it.

38:21.900 --> 38:24.970
Oh... Mom.

38:36.147 --> 38:38.116
Mom, I'm here.

38:38.149 --> 38:43.154
Right here, where you've
always been: beside me,

38:43.188 --> 38:46.958
helping me.

38:46.992 --> 38:49.227
Mom, can you hear me?

39:06.177 --> 39:08.146
MINA:
You're famous.

39:08.179 --> 39:10.516
Just think how much more
insufferable you'll be.

39:10.549 --> 39:12.017
I wouldn't count on it.

39:12.050 --> 39:14.185
I have recently dined
on humble pie,

39:14.219 --> 39:16.488
and it's a flavor
I will not soon forget.

39:16.522 --> 39:19.057
That surgery was insane.

39:19.090 --> 39:21.059
I mean, we're all proud
of the work we did

39:21.092 --> 39:22.861
and are happy for Eloise
and her family,

39:22.894 --> 39:25.230
but that could have ended
very badly.

39:25.263 --> 39:27.065
A triple tragedy.

39:27.098 --> 39:30.035
Skill certainly played
a large part, but so did luck.

39:30.068 --> 39:33.171
-It was practically a miracle.
-(clears throat)

39:33.204 --> 39:36.074
Check it out. Our next surgery.

39:36.107 --> 39:38.376
What are you gonna do?

39:38.410 --> 39:40.912
Uh,are going
to perform a flawless

39:40.946 --> 39:43.048
aortic valve replacement.

39:43.081 --> 39:45.951
-With a QuoVadis valve?
-A-A QuoVadis valve? Excuse me?

39:45.984 --> 39:48.687
There are no QuoVadis valves
on Chastain shelves.

39:48.720 --> 39:50.589
-(sniffles)
-Are you telling me...

39:50.622 --> 39:52.057
-(chuckles)
-Bell pulled them?

39:52.090 --> 39:54.092
Every last one.

39:54.125 --> 39:57.095
We've got the old reliable
valves back for good.

39:57.128 --> 39:58.797
-Well, today is
truly miraculous.
-Mm.

39:58.830 --> 40:02.267
Bell, of all people,
did the right thing.

40:06.071 --> 40:09.040
You pulled the valves.
Are you insane?

40:09.074 --> 40:11.142
It was the right thing to do.

40:11.176 --> 40:14.780
And I believe, eventually,
you'll agree with my decision.

40:14.813 --> 40:16.582
This is way out of line.

40:16.615 --> 40:18.817
Obviously,
there will be consequences.

40:18.850 --> 40:20.852
You'll regret this, Dr. Bell.

40:29.495 --> 40:32.030
Long day.

40:34.833 --> 40:37.068
A great day.

40:37.102 --> 40:38.837
(knocking on door)

40:38.870 --> 40:40.438
I'm leaving, Dr. B. Uh, don't
forget you have that dinner

40:40.472 --> 40:42.474
with the CEO
of Atlanta General at 8:00.

40:42.508 --> 40:44.910
I canceled it. I have surgery.

40:44.943 --> 40:46.678
GRAYSON:
Ah, that's a nice change.

40:46.712 --> 40:49.380
See you tomorrow, boss.

40:52.618 --> 40:54.686
To you.

40:54.720 --> 40:58.490
Thank you for what you did.

41:01.059 --> 41:04.029
Thank you.

41:04.062 --> 41:06.064
Allow me.

41:18.910 --> 41:21.146
It's a good look.

41:21.179 --> 41:24.550
-Yeah, I just had it pressed.
-(chuckles softly)

41:26.151 --> 41:28.153
(line ringing)

41:31.189 --> 41:33.124
(over phone):
You've reached Mark Truscott,

41:33.158 --> 41:35.293
Director of the Center
of Devices at the FDA.

41:35.326 --> 41:37.128
Leave a message.

41:37.162 --> 41:38.530
(beeps)

41:44.169 --> 41:46.738
CONRAD:
You broke into Julian's place?

41:46.772 --> 41:48.406
DEVON:
Not exactly.

41:48.439 --> 41:50.909
The landlady let me in
to get Julian's cat.

41:50.942 --> 41:52.644
Don't ask.

41:52.678 --> 41:55.747
-And you just took
her phone bill.
-Yes.

41:55.781 --> 41:58.049
Look at the last number
that Julian called.

41:58.083 --> 42:01.186
On the 3rd,
the day I saw her in the park.

42:01.219 --> 42:02.754
The day she disappeared.

42:02.788 --> 42:04.723
I tried the number
about an hour ago

42:04.756 --> 42:07.325
and I got an answering machine.

42:07.358 --> 42:10.495
It was an office at the FDA.

42:10.528 --> 42:12.363
Julian was a device rep.

42:12.397 --> 42:13.932
She probably called them
all the time.

42:13.965 --> 42:15.233
Or maybe she found something out

42:15.266 --> 42:17.402
and she was trying
to blow the whistle.

42:19.237 --> 42:22.741
Look, you said it yourself.

42:22.774 --> 42:25.777
Bradley died because
of a defective valve.

42:27.045 --> 42:29.715
He was my best friend.

42:29.748 --> 42:33.118
Did QuoVadis know
the valve was bad?

42:33.151 --> 42:37.422
If so, they killed him.

42:37.455 --> 42:40.191
Julian told me that something
was wrong at work.

42:40.225 --> 42:44.029
She felt like
everything was falling apart.

42:44.062 --> 42:45.897
What do you think she meant?

42:47.232 --> 42:49.735
I think she was in danger.

42:49.768 --> 42:53.238
Did they kill her?
Did she run away?

42:53.271 --> 42:55.941
I don't know.

42:55.974 --> 42:58.910
Something is up with QuoVadis.

43:03.248 --> 43:04.449
(Nic sighs)

43:04.482 --> 43:07.018
Let's figure out
what to do next.

43:08.019 --> 43:10.488
(shuddering)

43:17.663 --> 43:23.802
* All my worlds

43:23.835 --> 43:30.842
* And fault.

43:32.043 --> 43:34.112
Captioned by
Media Access Group at WGBH

44:14.485 --> 44:16.221
You survived your shift
with The Resident.

44:16.254 --> 44:18.824
Now here are a few more shows
to check out from Fox.

44:21.092 --> 44:22.894
Welcome to the galaxy.

44:24.095 --> 44:26.064
Should be fun. I'll lead.

44:27.899 --> 44:30.802
* We're breaking waves
Shooting stars *

44:30.836 --> 44:32.170
We're gonna make a run for it.

44:32.203 --> 44:33.404
* Live for glory, not forever *

44:33.438 --> 44:37.876
-Go!
-* Reach out *

44:37.909 --> 44:41.479
* Make this right here
Right now *

44:41.512 --> 44:45.250
* Stand up *

44:45.283 --> 44:48.053
-* Here right now *
-Now!
