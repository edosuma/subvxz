WEBVTT

00:45.963 --> 00:47.923
All right, let's do this.

00:48.549 --> 00:51.468
Wait, don't you think
we should look at the instructions?

00:51.552 --> 00:52.845
Nope.

00:52.928 --> 00:54.972
Is this gonna be like Settlers of Catan?

00:55.055 --> 00:56.723
'Cause no one will play with you anymore.

00:57.516 --> 01:00.227
Fine, we will use the instructions.
What's the first step?

01:03.230 --> 01:04.480
Wait.

01:05.399 --> 01:06.692
What does it say?

01:09.111 --> 01:11.071
It's just pictures.

01:13.657 --> 01:15.993
How is this in any way helpful?

01:16.076 --> 01:18.036
I think that it's not helpful.

01:19.204 --> 01:23.083
Did they somehow run out of money
while they were doing this? What?

01:23.166 --> 01:26.753
All right, screw it.
Let's put some poles in some holes.

01:26.837 --> 01:28.005
Keep it clean, Gimble.

01:28.088 --> 01:29.882
So, let me--

01:29.965 --> 01:32.092
Are these the longest? These are the...

01:32.176 --> 01:33.802
-This has a-- Yeah, there we go.
-That one.

01:33.886 --> 01:35.888
Now, what do we think this is,
a side or a top?

01:35.971 --> 01:38.682
-This is the inside.
-These are just, like, clamps.

01:38.765 --> 01:39.850
-Hey.
-Just do--

01:39.933 --> 01:43.103
Well, this... goes here.

01:43.187 --> 01:45.022
As far as we know.

01:45.105 --> 01:47.608
And this goes here.

01:47.691 --> 01:48.775
I mean, it fits.

01:48.859 --> 01:51.904
And that hooks into the end here.

01:51.987 --> 01:52.988
I think we're good.

01:53.071 --> 01:56.533
Are you concerned
that we have so many of these left?

02:00.579 --> 02:03.916
No-- Yeah, these are just extra pieces.
We don't need them.

02:05.000 --> 02:07.628
And this goes... here.

02:08.753 --> 02:11.798
These go like this.

02:13.634 --> 02:15.302
And...

02:16.470 --> 02:17.930
It's a tent!

02:18.013 --> 02:20.349
If only Marv and Joanna could see us now.

02:21.016 --> 02:23.352
Okay, let's...

02:23.852 --> 02:25.938
-Oh, it's spacious.
-It's nice?

02:26.897 --> 02:28.440
-I want you to come in here so bad.
-Yeah?

02:28.524 --> 02:30.275
-Come in here, my darling, please.
-Oh, wow.

02:30.359 --> 02:32.694
-Yes. Welcome.
-Thank you. Oh, my God, this is nice.

02:33.695 --> 02:35.280
Cue our security system here.

02:36.573 --> 02:38.283
-We've got tons of room.
-Oh, yeah.

02:50.963 --> 02:52.297
I'm sorry I broke the tent.

02:53.090 --> 02:55.133
It's okay. It wasn't your fault.

02:55.634 --> 02:59.096
No, I know sleeping outside
is your worst nightmare.

03:01.890 --> 03:03.433
As long as I'm with you.

03:21.869 --> 03:23.120
Carson!

03:24.830 --> 03:26.248
Carson!

03:28.584 --> 03:29.751
Carson?

03:30.252 --> 03:31.587
Leave me alone.

03:32.880 --> 03:33.797
Hey, buddy.

03:33.881 --> 03:35.090
Go away.

03:36.300 --> 03:37.801
Ow! What the hell?

03:37.885 --> 03:39.428
I said go away!

03:39.511 --> 03:42.014
Ow! Hey! Stop that.

03:43.265 --> 03:45.684
Wait, why are you only in your underwear?

03:45.767 --> 03:48.520
I'm not gonna wear anything she gave me.

03:48.604 --> 03:50.355
Then who gave you the underwear?

03:50.439 --> 03:53.775
Look, anyway, Carson, you need
to come down from there right now.

03:53.859 --> 03:56.195
No. And I never wanna see my sister again.

03:56.278 --> 03:58.405
So you're just gonna spend
the rest of your life in that tree?

03:58.488 --> 03:59.907
If I choose to.

03:59.990 --> 04:01.742
Fine, then I'm coming up.

04:03.535 --> 04:05.412
Okay, you need to come down.

04:05.495 --> 04:07.664
And you need to forgive
your sister-- your mother.

04:07.748 --> 04:09.750
This whole thing is very Chinatown.

04:09.833 --> 04:11.293
-What?
-It's a movie.

04:11.376 --> 04:13.462
-Like Air Bud?
-Not like Air Bud.

04:14.630 --> 04:18.257
Look, I know you're mad at Emma, but--

04:18.341 --> 04:19.551
She lied to me.

04:19.635 --> 04:23.222
She was my mom this whole time
and she lied to me!

04:23.305 --> 04:25.390
Yes, she did. And lying is wrong.

04:25.474 --> 04:27.518
But she thought
she was doing the right thing.

04:28.936 --> 04:32.356
People are complicated, Carson.
Even moms make mistakes.

04:32.898 --> 04:36.610
But we can't just run away from the people
we love because they're not perfect.

04:36.693 --> 04:38.028
We have to forgive them.

04:38.111 --> 04:40.572
-I can't.
-I know it's hard.

04:40.656 --> 04:43.534
Relationships are not
like playing the kazoo.

04:44.326 --> 04:46.203
They take work. But they're worth it.

04:47.621 --> 04:49.414
I mean, think about it.

04:49.957 --> 04:53.710
You really never, ever
wanna see her again? Ever?

04:57.881 --> 04:59.842
I think I'm ready to come down now.

04:59.925 --> 05:01.593
Okay. Do y--

05:06.974 --> 05:08.183
Carson!

05:10.727 --> 05:13.564
Oh, I am so sorry, Carson!

05:14.356 --> 05:15.399
Why did you lie?

05:16.400 --> 05:18.652
Because I was afraid
of what people would say.

05:19.278 --> 05:23.323
But that shouldn't have mattered,
because I am so proud to be your mom.

05:28.203 --> 05:29.454
I'll leave you two alone.

05:29.955 --> 05:31.331
No. Wait.

05:33.166 --> 05:35.878
Thank you for finding Carson tonight

05:35.961 --> 05:39.882
and for everything else
that you've done for him, and for me.

05:39.965 --> 05:42.009
You are a good man.

05:42.092 --> 05:46.680
And I wanna be with you and live
in a place where I can have a new start.

05:46.763 --> 05:48.307
So if you'll have me...

05:49.808 --> 05:52.728
I say tomorrow morning we cross
that bridge out of Schmigadoon

05:52.811 --> 05:54.730
and head to New York together.

05:58.400 --> 06:00.110
Let's do it.

06:08.452 --> 06:09.786
Melissa.

06:09.870 --> 06:10.871
Jorge?

06:11.538 --> 06:13.457
I'm so glad I found you.

06:13.540 --> 06:16.668
Blerky told me what she did to you
and it's unforgivable.

06:16.752 --> 06:18.504
But I'm here to bring you back home

06:18.587 --> 06:21.507
because you, and only you,
are the one I love.

06:22.257 --> 06:24.468
I knew you'd choose me over her.

06:24.551 --> 06:28.138
And I'm ready to be challenged and to be
molded into the man you want me to be

06:28.222 --> 06:30.140
and follow you wherever you wanna go.

06:30.933 --> 06:32.142
If you'll have me.

06:32.893 --> 06:33.894
Will you?

06:35.145 --> 06:36.939
Of course I will.

06:42.361 --> 06:43.570
Do you love my son?

06:45.113 --> 06:46.865
Mama, you're only here
because you know how to drive.

06:46.949 --> 06:50.494
Jorge, please.
I have something I need to say.

06:50.577 --> 06:55.791
A week ago my husband of 50 years
died in my arms.

06:56.542 --> 07:00.128
When I buried him,
it was like burying a part of me.

07:00.212 --> 07:02.422
So I think I know something of love.

07:04.132 --> 07:06.718
Tell me, do you love my son?

07:08.345 --> 07:10.138
You have one heart.

07:10.931 --> 07:13.225
Is he the one you want to give it to?

07:19.314 --> 07:20.482
Jorge.

07:21.024 --> 07:24.111
Melissa, no. We belong together.

07:24.194 --> 07:26.029
You want to give it to someone else.

07:26.113 --> 07:28.323
Mama, you're ruining this.

07:29.950 --> 07:34.329
I think I do. But honestly, I don't know.

07:34.413 --> 07:37.332
I mean, yes, there are times

07:37.416 --> 07:40.502
when it feels like
we're the only two people in the world.

07:40.586 --> 07:44.882
And we laugh,
and our eyes meet, and it's like magic.

07:47.342 --> 07:50.429
But there are times
we seem so disconnected,

07:50.512 --> 07:54.349
and I don't even know if he loves me,
or if I love him.

07:54.433 --> 07:58.896
And it just feels so lonely.

08:00.439 --> 08:06.069
Mi'jita, what you have just described
is... love.

08:06.820 --> 08:09.406
It is not something
you can prove is there.

08:09.489 --> 08:13.785
It is something you choose to believe in.
Every day.

08:13.869 --> 08:16.330
You must go to him. Tell him how you feel.

08:16.413 --> 08:19.124
Jorge, get in!
We are taking Miss Melissa to her love.

08:19.208 --> 08:22.503
-Mama--
-Do it! And stop moping.

08:23.170 --> 08:26.298
You are gorgeous.
You'll find someone else in no time.

08:26.381 --> 08:27.382
Come on! Hurry!

08:30.636 --> 08:33.304
I can't believe
we're actually going to New York City!

08:33.388 --> 08:35.640
That's right,
the greatest city in the world.

08:35.724 --> 08:37.142
What's it like there, Dr. Skinner?

08:37.226 --> 08:38.936
It's amazing, buddy, you're gonna love it.

08:39.019 --> 08:42.563
Tallest skyscrapers you've ever seen,
so many people, so many lights,

08:42.648 --> 08:45.150
so many... drugstores.

08:45.234 --> 08:46.360
Will there be snow?

08:57.579 --> 08:59.081
Yes, there'll be snow.

08:59.164 --> 09:00.541
Will there be candy?

09:12.594 --> 09:14.763
Yep. There'll be candy.

09:15.597 --> 09:17.850
Then it sounds like
New York will have everything.

09:18.350 --> 09:21.353
All right, ready to cross
and start our new lives?

09:22.396 --> 09:26.400
On three. One, two, three.

09:29.862 --> 09:30.988
Is everything okay?

09:32.072 --> 09:33.866
Yeah, yeah, fine. I'm just...

09:35.200 --> 09:38.412
It's just a big deal...
heading back home, I guess.

09:38.495 --> 09:40.914
Of course. Take your time.

09:47.963 --> 09:49.173
But...

09:50.632 --> 09:54.303
New York won't have everything, will it?

09:57.931 --> 09:59.516
It's extraordinary, really.

10:00.392 --> 10:03.395
One can be convinced
they are the smartest person in town

10:03.478 --> 10:07.024
and yet still miss
the most important detail.

10:07.691 --> 10:09.109
I am so sorry, Emma.

10:09.193 --> 10:10.277
What's happening?

10:10.360 --> 10:12.821
He's getting cold feet. Kiss him!

10:12.905 --> 10:14.364
I really care about you.

10:16.116 --> 10:17.326
Both of you.

10:20.204 --> 10:21.705
You changed me.

10:22.998 --> 10:24.917
You made me a better person.

10:25.000 --> 10:27.085
I am so sorry.

10:28.086 --> 10:29.296
I didn't...

10:30.881 --> 10:32.633
-I didn't--
-I know.

10:36.386 --> 10:37.888
Go.

10:48.482 --> 10:52.861
Vote for Layton. Vote for Layton.
Mildred. That's Mildred to you.

10:52.945 --> 10:55.864
Vote for Layton. Mildred.
Vote for Layton. Thank you.

10:57.658 --> 10:59.868
Morning, Aloysius. Morning, Florence.

11:00.744 --> 11:04.540
I keep forgetting she's
still too embarrassed to appear in public.

11:04.623 --> 11:07.000
Anyhoo, good luck today.
You're gonna need it.

11:07.084 --> 11:08.585
Ladies, can I get a cackle?

11:11.380 --> 11:14.800
Well, since Carson isn't here,
I've been asked to yell stuff out.

11:15.551 --> 11:17.761
So, hear ye, hear ye,

11:17.845 --> 11:21.306
it is now exactly nine on the o'clock,
and according to the town charter,

11:21.390 --> 11:23.183
time to hold the vote for mayor.

11:24.101 --> 11:27.145
The two candidates are Aloysius Menlove...

11:29.523 --> 11:30.524
and Mildred Layton.

11:31.149 --> 11:32.234
Vote for Layton!

11:32.317 --> 11:33.443
Layton for mayor!

11:33.527 --> 11:37.322
We will vote according to Schmigadoon
tradition, by the show of hands.

11:38.699 --> 11:40.826
-All in favor of Mildred--
-Josh!

11:41.451 --> 11:43.412
Where's Josh? Dr. Skinner?

11:43.912 --> 11:46.206
Has anyone seen him?
I need to talk to him.

11:46.290 --> 11:49.960
Do you mind? We are about
to begin the mayoral election!

11:50.043 --> 11:52.421
Strife and tribulation, people.
Strife and tribulation!

11:53.088 --> 11:54.840
Wait, what?

11:54.923 --> 11:56.842
Did I miss something? Was there a song?

11:56.925 --> 12:00.012
-Shall we proceed with the vote, Howard?
-Yes, dearest.

12:00.095 --> 12:02.764
We shall now vote by the show of hands.

12:02.848 --> 12:04.892
-All in favor of Mildred--
-Melissa!

12:06.018 --> 12:07.311
Oh, for the love of Pete!

12:08.103 --> 12:09.104
Josh.

12:10.147 --> 12:11.523
-I'm sorry.
-Mel.

12:11.607 --> 12:13.567
No. I am.

12:13.650 --> 12:19.239
I'm sorry for acting like everything
that wasn't perfect was a failure.

12:19.323 --> 12:23.076
For treating you like
a burden that I had to carry

12:23.160 --> 12:26.121
on my way to some ridiculous fantasy.

12:26.705 --> 12:28.832
For pushing you to change

12:28.916 --> 12:33.170
without ever considering
maybe I needed to change too.

12:35.214 --> 12:39.968
And I just want you to know
that I'm in it for the long haul.

12:40.052 --> 12:42.471
That I choose to believe in us.

12:43.263 --> 12:47.100
Whether in Schmigadoon,
in New York, wherever.

12:47.935 --> 12:50.729
Because I love you, Josh Skinner.

12:51.647 --> 12:56.318
And you are, and always have been, enough.

13:03.575 --> 13:08.247
I am not a man of many words

13:11.250 --> 13:16.338
Never been romantic
Like all the lovesick herds

13:18.507 --> 13:22.678
I laughed at every sentimental thing

13:24.346 --> 13:28.058
But you make me wanna sing

13:28.141 --> 13:29.351
Josh.

13:30.435 --> 13:35.983
Seems my heart was always like a stone

13:37.568 --> 13:40.487
Even when you're with me

13:41.029 --> 13:43.657
You kind of feel alone

13:44.408 --> 13:50.747
And so I bounced
From fling to fling to fling

13:51.498 --> 13:57.296
But you make me wanna sing

13:57.379 --> 14:01.258
I wanna hold you

14:01.884 --> 14:05.137
And spin you around

14:05.220 --> 14:10.726
So fast that we'll never part

14:10.809 --> 14:14.146
I wanna hold you

14:15.355 --> 14:18.650
And spin you around

14:18.734 --> 14:24.406
'Cause that's what you've done
To my heart

14:27.534 --> 14:32.915
Now I'm here and offering my hand

14:34.625 --> 14:37.336
And asking you to take it

14:38.045 --> 14:41.548
So we can make a stand

14:41.632 --> 14:47.387
For love and all the joy
That it can bring

14:48.639 --> 14:54.895
'Cause you make me wanna sing

15:57.207 --> 16:03.005
Now I'm here and offering my hand

16:04.298 --> 16:07.259
And I will gladly take it

16:07.801 --> 16:11.305
So we can make a stand

16:11.388 --> 16:18.353
For love and all the joy
That it can bring

16:19.897 --> 16:26.737
'Cause you make me wanna sing

16:33.994 --> 16:35.996
No! Boo! No!

16:36.079 --> 16:38.248
Why are you cheering
for these sinful city folk?

16:38.332 --> 16:40.459
Have you forgotten
what they've done to this town?

16:40.542 --> 16:44.004
No. I haven't forgotten,
and I hope I never will.

16:44.087 --> 16:46.298
I hope none of us ever will.

16:46.381 --> 16:49.968
Because they've made Schmigadoon better.
For everyone.

16:50.052 --> 16:52.721
I know I should hate her,
but I kinda love her.

16:52.804 --> 16:57.059
How can you even dare to suggest
they've made Schmigadoon better?

16:57.142 --> 16:58.852
That's a load of fiddle-faddle!

16:58.936 --> 17:00.103
First off, the mayor--

17:00.187 --> 17:03.732
The mayor?
Let me tell you about the mayor.

17:03.815 --> 17:08.028
The mayor is finally being honest
about who he really is.

17:08.111 --> 17:09.738
And I love him for it.

17:10.864 --> 17:12.074
Thank you, Florence.

17:12.741 --> 17:14.242
And I love you for that.

17:15.285 --> 17:19.248
Just not, you know, bedroom love.

17:19.330 --> 17:23.126
Oh, believe me, I know. I'm not stupid.

17:23.210 --> 17:25.462
Maybe it's time we all start
following the mayor's example

17:25.546 --> 17:28.632
and were more honest
about who we really are.

17:29.925 --> 17:32.135
For instance, I'm not Carson's sister.

17:32.845 --> 17:33.846
I'm his mother.

17:35.097 --> 17:37.182
I knew it!
I knew that child was a bastard!

17:37.266 --> 17:38.433
You're a bastard!

17:39.226 --> 17:41.687
You can call him any nasty name you want.

17:42.354 --> 17:46.233
But the circumstances around my son's
birth have nothing to do with who he is.

17:48.610 --> 17:49.778
I love you, Carson.

17:50.529 --> 17:51.947
I love you too, Mom.

17:53.949 --> 17:55.367
What's wrong?

17:56.410 --> 18:00.831
I just hadn't realized how much
I really wanted to hear you call me that.

18:02.457 --> 18:04.126
Oh, give me a break!

18:04.209 --> 18:06.503
I suppose you and the mayor
expect to be admired

18:06.587 --> 18:08.380
for airing your dirty laundry in public.

18:08.463 --> 18:13.385
Well, wake up, sister, because
the two of you are all alone in this!

18:13.468 --> 18:16.013
The rest of us are good, decent people.

18:16.096 --> 18:20.350
God-fearing Schmigadoonians
who are exactly whom we purport to be!

18:21.059 --> 18:24.855
Actually, I hate being an innkeeper.

18:24.938 --> 18:26.648
I wanna be an actor.

18:26.732 --> 18:30.527
I've been working on a one-man show about
my father's death for the last two years.

18:30.611 --> 18:33.113
Yes! You go, Harvey!

18:33.197 --> 18:36.366
Remember the old mill fire last year?
I set that myself.

18:36.450 --> 18:38.660
-Yikes.
-I like getting injured.

18:38.744 --> 18:40.037
I do it for the attention.

18:40.120 --> 18:42.039
You be you, Pete.

18:42.122 --> 18:43.123
Ow!

18:43.207 --> 18:46.001
Actually, I'm a veterinarian.

18:46.084 --> 18:47.836
I'm pretty sure I'm a socialist.

18:47.920 --> 18:49.963
I'm tired of being a rapscallion.

18:50.047 --> 18:51.298
I wanna be better.

18:51.381 --> 18:52.716
It's time everyone knew,

18:53.300 --> 18:55.427
there's really no way
to win the ring toss.

18:57.012 --> 18:59.264
Okay, time to vote. So let's--

18:59.348 --> 19:02.976
I got pregnant out of wedlock
with a seaman. And yes, I heard it.

19:03.060 --> 19:04.811
Nancy! What are you doing?

19:04.895 --> 19:06.480
It's time everyone knew, Mother.

19:06.563 --> 19:08.982
I'm tired of hiding
just because you're ashamed of me.

19:09.608 --> 19:10.859
Mother?

19:10.943 --> 19:12.194
Yee honk.

19:13.028 --> 19:15.697
So I guess you do have secrets, Mildred.

19:16.281 --> 19:19.660
Are you going to let him talk
to me like that, Howard? Are you?

19:19.743 --> 19:22.955
He's only telling the truth, Mildred.
And I'm glad it's out.

19:23.038 --> 19:26.375
I'm sorry, Nancy. We never should have
kept you hidden away like that.

19:26.458 --> 19:28.502
And speaking of the truth,

19:28.585 --> 19:30.295
it's time I let all of you know...

19:32.297 --> 19:34.216
that I am a homosexual too.

19:35.801 --> 19:38.262
And I have feelings for Aloysius.

19:39.763 --> 19:40.973
You do?

19:45.269 --> 19:48.438
Oh, no. No. This can't be happening.

19:48.522 --> 19:51.650
-Mildred...
-No! I don't want your pity.

19:51.733 --> 19:54.361
Because I am stronger than you.
I am stronger than all of you!

19:54.444 --> 19:58.407
So go ahead, let it all out,
be "true" to yourselves.

19:58.490 --> 20:02.494
Because here is the real truth:
you are toilet people!

20:03.954 --> 20:05.831
I hope you all die and go straight to hell

20:05.914 --> 20:08.000
because that's exactly
where you idiots belong!

20:08.083 --> 20:09.668
I hate you!

20:11.336 --> 20:13.589
All right. Time for the vote.

20:14.173 --> 20:17.050
I'd like to explain
exactly what I meant by that.

20:17.134 --> 20:20.929
All in favor of Mildred Layton for mayor,
raise your hands.

20:28.937 --> 20:31.899
Howard... raise your hand.

20:31.982 --> 20:33.358
No, Mildred.

20:34.151 --> 20:36.278
All right, that's one vote
for Mildred Layton.

20:36.361 --> 20:40.324
And now, all in favor of Aloysius Menlove
for mayor, raise your hands.

20:44.286 --> 20:46.997
Looks like it's Mayor Menlove
by a landslide.

20:48.415 --> 20:50.709
Thank you! Thank you for your support.

20:50.792 --> 20:56.423
I am honored to be
Schmigadoon's first openly gay anything.

21:12.397 --> 21:13.440
What are you doing?

21:14.066 --> 21:17.277
I know what it's like to wanna fix
everyone around you

21:17.361 --> 21:19.863
and think that's the only way to be happy.

21:19.947 --> 21:21.365
But it's not.

21:21.448 --> 21:22.866
You have to learn to let go.

21:24.117 --> 21:27.120
But... I'm a good person.

21:28.372 --> 21:29.706
Not really.

21:29.790 --> 21:32.167
You're kind of a controlling,
judgmental asshole.

21:32.251 --> 21:33.085
Yeah.

21:34.711 --> 21:36.547
But you don't have to stay that way.

21:38.006 --> 21:40.092
That's what's so great about change.

21:42.302 --> 21:45.722
There's always the hope
we can be something better than we are.

21:47.808 --> 21:50.811
It's not too late. I promise.

22:03.532 --> 22:09.162
This is how we change

22:09.246 --> 22:14.835
Reimagine, rearrange

22:14.918 --> 22:21.675
See ourselves through others' eyes

22:22.176 --> 22:27.806
Reexamine, realize

22:27.890 --> 22:33.437
This is how we grow

22:33.520 --> 22:38.317
Blossom burst, melting snow

22:39.234 --> 22:46.074
Find another way to learn

22:46.158 --> 22:50.954
Let the soaring phoenix burn

22:51.038 --> 22:52.331
A hurt

22:52.414 --> 22:54.208
A lie

22:54.291 --> 22:55.334
A kiss

22:55.417 --> 22:57.044
A goodbye

22:57.127 --> 22:58.295
We stretch

22:58.378 --> 22:59.671
We hope

22:59.755 --> 23:01.006
We reach

23:01.089 --> 23:02.716
We try

23:02.799 --> 23:08.680
The miracle of intersection

23:08.764 --> 23:15.729
Two hearts meet
Both change direction

23:16.980 --> 23:22.611
-This is how we change
-This is how we change

23:22.694 --> 23:27.032
This is how

23:27.115 --> 23:31.912

24:04.069 --> 24:06.321
We change

24:06.405 --> 24:09.825
Schmigadoon

24:09.908 --> 24:13.328
Where the sun shines bright
From July to June

24:13.412 --> 24:16.707
And the air's as sweet as a macaroon

24:16.790 --> 24:20.210
Schmigadoon

24:20.294 --> 24:23.714
Where we learned to change
And we learned to grow

24:23.797 --> 24:27.843
What the future holds
Well, we just don't know

24:27.926 --> 24:30.679
But there's hope for all
And we call it

24:30.762 --> 24:33.807
Yes, there's hope for all
And we call it

24:33.891 --> 24:38.562
Oh, there's hope for all
And we call it

24:38.645 --> 24:42.149
Schmiga--

25:28.529 --> 25:31.907
This is how we change

25:31.990 --> 25:35.285
Reimagine, rearrange

25:35.369 --> 25:38.830

Schmigadoon

26:01.228 --> 26:04.565
Where the sun shines bright
From July to June

26:04.648 --> 26:08.026
And the air's as sweet as a macaroon

26:08.110 --> 26:11.488
Schmigadoon

26:11.572 --> 26:14.992
Where we learned to change
And we learned to grow

26:15.075 --> 26:18.620
What the future holds
Well, we just don't know

26:18.704 --> 26:21.874
But there's hope for all
And we call it

Yes, there's hope for all

26:25.586 --> 26:30.382
Oh, there's hope for all
And we call it

26:30.465 --> 26:32.926
Schmiga--
