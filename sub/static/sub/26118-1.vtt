WEBVTT

00:22.800 --> 00:25.960
'Hey, girl! How're you holding up?
Is Phillip still bugging you?'

00:26.000 --> 00:29.000
No, you have no idea.
It's been a nightmare.

00:29.040 --> 00:32.200
It's like he couldn't take
no for an answer.

00:32.240 --> 00:34.880
'Seriously? It's not really
that big of a surprise.

00:34.920 --> 00:36.840
'He is a little out there,
you know?'

00:36.880 --> 00:40.840
It's been three weeks since we
broke up and he's still texting me!

00:42.240 --> 00:44.120
Not cool. 'Way uncool.

00:44.160 --> 00:46.720
'You totally need to unwind
and forget about him.

00:46.760 --> 00:48.040
'Let's grab some drinks!'

00:48.080 --> 00:51.200
That sounds amazing.
I could really use a night out.

00:51.240 --> 00:53.240
See you at the bar in 20?

00:53.280 --> 00:55.240
'Um, I think
you should call it five.'

00:55.280 --> 00:57.120
OK. I will.

00:57.160 --> 00:59.440
'Sweet. I'll see you soon!

00:59.480 --> 01:01.160
'Bye!'

01:01.200 --> 01:03.080
Bye!

01:14.720 --> 01:17.560
RUSTLING SOUND

01:26.120 --> 01:27.120
Oh!

01:27.160 --> 01:28.720
God, you scared me!

02:10.600 --> 02:12.480
Hi!

02:12.520 --> 02:15.160
Hi, I'm Melissa Davis.

02:15.200 --> 02:17.520
Hi. Er, John...

02:17.560 --> 02:18.680
..Anderson.

02:20.920 --> 02:24.160
Can I come in? Oh, yes, of course!
Please, come on in.

02:24.200 --> 02:25.680
Thanks.

02:27.280 --> 02:29.480
So, this is it.

02:29.520 --> 02:31.640
It needs a little work.

02:31.680 --> 02:34.200
This is... This is insane.

02:34.240 --> 02:36.720
God, look at this view!
The place is pretty great.

02:36.760 --> 02:39.160
The table and chandeliers were here,
but other than that,

02:39.200 --> 02:40.600
it was just like this.

02:40.640 --> 02:42.200
Wow.

02:42.240 --> 02:43.720
Yes!

02:43.760 --> 02:45.280
This is wonderful.

02:45.320 --> 02:46.880
Open kitchen!

02:46.920 --> 02:48.320
Um, yeah!

02:50.680 --> 02:53.400
This is going to look really great
with what I had in mind.

02:53.440 --> 02:55.400
Travis said you were looking

02:55.440 --> 02:57.480
for something
a little more contemporary. Mm.

02:57.520 --> 03:00.360
I took the liberty
of putting some ideas together.

03:00.400 --> 03:02.880
Mm, yeah. These are terrific.

03:02.920 --> 03:05.560
I found some pictures
of the interiors online.

03:05.600 --> 03:07.800
Oh, I can tell you've put
a lot of work into this.

03:07.840 --> 03:09.880
I'm a pilot.
I travel a lot for work,

03:09.920 --> 03:12.040
so too much detail is wasted on me.

03:12.080 --> 03:14.840
I appreciate
the simple detail here.

03:14.880 --> 03:17.520
I like this one a lot too. Oh, yeah.

03:17.560 --> 03:19.240
This is my favourite, and look...
Mm-hm.

03:19.280 --> 03:22.400
..this set-up... These are
definitely in the right direction.

03:22.440 --> 03:25.520
It's like you read my mind
and you made it better.

03:25.560 --> 03:27.000
Oh, thanks.

03:27.040 --> 03:28.520
Would you like to see the bedroom?

03:28.560 --> 03:30.440
What?

03:30.480 --> 03:33.720
Would you like to go see the space
where the bedroom would be,

03:33.760 --> 03:35.440
so that you can do your job?

03:35.480 --> 03:36.960
Oh, got it! Wait!

03:38.080 --> 03:40.320
I have the job? Are you sure?

03:40.360 --> 03:42.560
Do you want to...
Your designs are amazing.

03:42.600 --> 03:46.200
Exactly what I'm going for.
You're perfect for the job.

03:47.640 --> 03:49.280
Special delivery!

03:49.320 --> 03:50.960
Oh! Hi, Travis!

03:51.000 --> 03:52.920
Got the tile for the upstairs
bathroom.

03:52.960 --> 03:54.160
Hey, man. How are you?

03:54.200 --> 03:56.600
Good, yeah. You've got a little
plaster there... Thanks.

03:56.640 --> 03:57.960
You were right about Melissa.

03:58.000 --> 03:59.400
Oh, he says that to all the girls.

03:59.440 --> 04:00.640
That's not true.

04:00.680 --> 04:02.920
And you're the best contractor
I've ever worked with.

04:02.960 --> 04:05.440
You two are quite the deal.

04:06.560 --> 04:07.560
Yeah.

04:08.640 --> 04:10.520
Well, I'm gonna get started on
this.

04:10.560 --> 04:12.800
See you up there? Yes. Have fun!

04:14.000 --> 04:17.800
So... Do you want to show me
the rest of the house? Yes!

04:17.840 --> 04:20.160
If you agree to have dinner
with me tomorrow night.

04:20.200 --> 04:21.840
I did it again.

04:21.880 --> 04:26.040
So that we can discuss the design,
furniture, carpets...

04:26.080 --> 04:28.320
Right. Business dinner. Mmm.

04:28.360 --> 04:29.640
Um...

04:29.680 --> 04:31.480
Of course.

04:31.520 --> 04:33.920
OK. Do you mind if I take
some measurements?

04:33.960 --> 04:35.840
And then I'll show you around. OK.

04:35.880 --> 04:37.200
This whole thing of pink paint,

04:37.240 --> 04:39.480
it just splat
all over my white shirt,

04:39.520 --> 04:42.440
and then Beth, she's fuming,
and the clerk looks at me,

04:42.480 --> 04:44.360
she's like, "You don't
have to pay for that."

04:44.400 --> 04:46.560
Oh, what a saint!

04:46.600 --> 04:49.680
Yeah. She actually gave us
two free gallons of paint

04:49.720 --> 04:52.560
and we finished the job. Wow!
Miracle. Miracle.

04:52.600 --> 04:54.080
Oh!

04:55.560 --> 04:57.080
You never told me that story.

04:57.120 --> 04:59.840
Yeah. I have these flashes
of memory sometimes.

04:59.880 --> 05:02.280
Yeah, me too.

05:02.320 --> 05:03.680
Guys, get in!

05:03.720 --> 05:06.880
A photo to celebrate this job!

05:13.800 --> 05:16.720
And cheers to Travis. Cheers!

05:16.760 --> 05:19.120
Oh! Thank you for this gig.
I really appreciate it.

05:19.160 --> 05:21.160
All right. Cheers. You're welcome.

05:21.200 --> 05:22.480
Cheers.

05:22.520 --> 05:25.120
OK, Travis that was great.
Love the story. Thank you.

05:25.160 --> 05:27.680
It had depth, you cared
about everybody in it,

05:27.720 --> 05:31.080
but here's the thing, ma'am.

05:31.120 --> 05:33.560
Tell us more about
this hot new client!

05:33.600 --> 05:35.400
Please give us details!

05:35.440 --> 05:37.280
Well, there's nothing really
to tell.

05:37.320 --> 05:40.320
He hired Travis
to remodel his house,

05:40.360 --> 05:43.720
and then Travis of course
referred me to decorate.

05:43.760 --> 05:44.880
And?

05:44.920 --> 05:47.360
And, erm,

05:47.400 --> 05:49.440
he offered me the job.

05:51.800 --> 05:53.920
And he invited me to dinner
tomorrow night

05:53.960 --> 05:56.240
to go over colour schemes
and patterns...

05:56.280 --> 05:58.160
And to talk about how many
children you want?!

05:58.200 --> 05:59.280
How tall is he?

05:59.320 --> 06:01.040
Does he have great arms?

06:01.080 --> 06:03.440
And, please tell me
about his six pack.

06:03.480 --> 06:04.720
Is it visible?

06:04.760 --> 06:06.320
Is it nice?

06:06.360 --> 06:07.960
OK, Ash. Calm down.

06:08.000 --> 06:10.000
I have no idea
what his arms look like.

06:10.040 --> 06:12.080
It's just going
to be talking shop, OK?

06:12.120 --> 06:13.240
You're kidding me.

06:13.280 --> 06:15.680
Brown eyes or blue,
because you love blue eyes?

06:15.720 --> 06:17.840
OK, both of you guys, calm down.

06:17.880 --> 06:19.520
Jeez!

06:19.560 --> 06:21.120
What's his name?

06:21.160 --> 06:22.800
John.

06:22.840 --> 06:23.920
Oh!

06:23.960 --> 06:25.880
Well, what did you say?
She said yes.

06:25.920 --> 06:28.920
You said yes, right? Because I'm
available tomorrow if you're not,

06:28.960 --> 06:31.720
and I will take him out on the town,
have a good time and all of that.

06:31.760 --> 06:33.640
I said yes. Yay!

06:33.680 --> 06:34.720
Really?

06:35.760 --> 06:37.240
Yeah, really.

06:37.280 --> 06:40.000
Why, are you jealous? Oooh!

06:40.040 --> 06:42.160
Someone's jealous! Wow.

06:42.200 --> 06:45.080
Oh, look at your little pouty mouth!

06:45.120 --> 06:46.960
Oh, yes!

06:47.000 --> 06:49.480
My name's Travis, I'm so jealous!

06:49.520 --> 06:50.960
No! No.

06:51.000 --> 06:53.080
OK, I'm not jealous.

06:53.120 --> 06:56.360
I mean, aren't you the one
that told me never to date clients?

06:56.400 --> 06:58.040
Oh, and you really took my advice

06:58.080 --> 07:00.200
and got right involved with Beth,
remember?

07:03.840 --> 07:05.800
Yeah. Yeah, I remember.

07:07.120 --> 07:09.360
Sorry. I shouldn't have said that.
It's all right.

07:09.400 --> 07:10.600
It's OK.

07:10.640 --> 07:13.880
You know, it's getting late.
I should probably get going.

07:13.920 --> 07:15.760
Oh. Oh, stay for another beer.

07:15.800 --> 07:17.960
It's OK, I've got an early morning
tomorrow.

07:18.000 --> 07:20.120
Goodnight, ladies.
Goodnight, Travis.

07:20.160 --> 07:22.440
See you tomorrow.
Yep, bright and early.

07:23.880 --> 07:26.360
Oh, man. Wow!
Shouldn't have said that.

07:26.400 --> 07:27.680
Maybe not.

07:27.720 --> 07:30.560
You know, we really need
to find a nice girl for Travis,

07:30.600 --> 07:32.200
or at least a really cute puppy.

07:33.440 --> 07:36.640
But.. Blue-eyed man of steel...

07:36.680 --> 07:38.040
OK...

07:38.080 --> 07:40.320
THEY WHISPER

07:50.320 --> 07:53.320
I really like this. Yeah?
They're terrific.

07:53.360 --> 07:56.440
I showed them to Travis this
morning. He loved them too.

07:56.480 --> 07:58.680
Anyway, that's all I have for now.

07:58.720 --> 08:01.120
I just want to make sure
you're happy before I start bringing

08:01.160 --> 08:02.520
these things into your house.

08:02.560 --> 08:05.000
I am very happy and I have all
the confidence in the world

08:05.040 --> 08:06.480
to go to knock this out of the park.

08:06.520 --> 08:09.760
Speaking of Travis, he said
that you're from Ohio.

08:09.800 --> 08:10.920
Go, Bucks!

08:10.960 --> 08:12.880
I am from Ohio.

08:12.920 --> 08:14.720
I was born and raised there.

08:14.760 --> 08:17.160
My parents still live there.
They'll never move.

08:17.200 --> 08:19.040
My parents feel the same
way about Montana.

08:19.080 --> 08:20.920
Oh, you're from Montana? Oh, yeah.

08:20.960 --> 08:22.480
Big sky. They own a ranch.

08:22.520 --> 08:25.200
So you have horses
and the whole cowboy getup?

08:25.240 --> 08:26.600
Yeah.

08:26.640 --> 08:27.960
SHE LAUGHS

08:28.000 --> 08:31.760
OK. So, you fly planes
and you ride horses.

08:31.800 --> 08:34.320
You're a real modern cowboy.

08:34.360 --> 08:36.200
Just don't call me ma'am.

08:36.240 --> 08:37.720
Yes, ma'am.

08:37.760 --> 08:39.160
Maybe we could go riding sometime?

08:39.200 --> 08:41.920
Or we can start with
a hike, and build up

08:41.960 --> 08:43.360
to actually getting on a horse?

08:43.400 --> 08:45.400
It's been a long time
since I've been on a horse

08:45.440 --> 08:47.360
so I think starting with the hike
would be best.

08:50.440 --> 08:53.160
I don't want to be
out of line or intrusive,

08:53.200 --> 08:58.800
but...can I ask you something that's
absolutely none of my business?

08:58.840 --> 09:00.440
Oh. OK.

09:00.480 --> 09:02.920
As long as I don't have to answer.
Deal.

09:04.160 --> 09:06.480
What's your relationship
with Travis?

09:06.520 --> 09:09.080
Oh. Oh, gosh.
We just work together.

09:10.840 --> 09:12.520
That's it? Yeah.

09:12.560 --> 09:14.320
Well, we've been through a lot.

09:14.360 --> 09:15.640
How's that?

09:15.680 --> 09:19.280
Well, Travis was the contractor
that my best friend Beth hired

09:19.320 --> 09:20.760
to remodel her house.

09:20.800 --> 09:24.480
Must have done a damn good job.
Oh, he did. He's very talented.

09:24.520 --> 09:26.520
Maybe I should be having dinner
with Travis.

09:26.560 --> 09:28.160
Maybe you should!

09:29.840 --> 09:31.760
Before Travis and I started
working together,

09:31.800 --> 09:34.360
I used to annoy him with
all my opinions on everything.

09:34.400 --> 09:35.960
He finally just ended up hiring me.

09:36.000 --> 09:37.960
We've been working together
ever since.

09:38.000 --> 09:41.120
So that's it? You just work
together. That's it. Good.

09:45.920 --> 09:48.160
Well, thanks for dinner.

09:48.200 --> 09:50.160
It's been really very lovely.

09:50.200 --> 09:51.680
Pleasure's all mine.

09:56.480 --> 09:59.320
I'd be lying if I said I didn't
want to get to know you better.

09:59.360 --> 10:01.560
I hope that doesn't offend you.

10:01.600 --> 10:03.120
No, it doesn't.

10:06.760 --> 10:08.440
It's just been a really long time

10:08.480 --> 10:11.200
since someone's
been interested in me.

10:21.680 --> 10:24.080
Shall we go grab a drink somewhere?

10:24.120 --> 10:26.520
I have a great bottle of Bordeaux
sitting at my house.

10:26.560 --> 10:28.720
I've been saving it
for a special occasion.

10:31.840 --> 10:34.440
How about this...
How about we save it

10:34.480 --> 10:37.160
till after I'm finished
decorating your house?

10:37.200 --> 10:39.120
That'll be a reason to celebrate.

10:40.800 --> 10:42.280
Sounds like a plan.

10:46.280 --> 10:48.760
This place is supposed to look
like the inside of a sports car!

10:48.800 --> 10:50.120
Bucket seats, leather...

10:51.720 --> 10:53.560
So, what do you think?
You've done a great job.

10:53.600 --> 10:54.640
Thanks.

10:54.680 --> 10:58.000
But art and furniture can't possibly
be making you this happy.

11:00.680 --> 11:03.560
So things are going well with him,
huh? With who?

11:03.600 --> 11:05.440
Your new boyfriend.

11:05.480 --> 11:07.160
He's not my boyfriend!

11:07.200 --> 11:09.880
How many nights have you hung
out with him this week?

11:09.920 --> 11:12.000
I don't know, like, three or four.

11:12.040 --> 11:14.640
Three or four nights,
for three weeks now?

11:14.680 --> 11:16.160
That's a lot of time.

11:16.200 --> 11:18.960
OK. We're just dating. Relax!

11:20.360 --> 11:23.360
With a smile like that? No, there's
more than dating going on.

11:24.440 --> 11:25.560
It's good.

11:25.600 --> 11:28.400
Good for you.
You deserve it, Melissa.

11:28.440 --> 11:31.040
Oh, that's nice. Thank you.

11:37.280 --> 11:39.120
So what about you, huh?

11:39.160 --> 11:41.560
It's been three years now.

11:43.640 --> 11:45.880
Hmm. I'm not ready.

11:50.040 --> 11:51.160
Hey.

11:51.200 --> 11:53.160
Hey! Come here.

11:54.920 --> 11:56.080
Sit.

12:01.400 --> 12:03.480
Beth would want you to.

12:03.520 --> 12:04.880
She would.

12:04.920 --> 12:07.160
And you're a catch.

12:07.200 --> 12:08.600
Huh?

12:08.640 --> 12:11.320
Any girl would be
so lucky to be with you.

12:12.400 --> 12:13.520
Really?

12:14.880 --> 12:16.160
Really.

12:17.880 --> 12:20.480
You know, Beth said before she...

12:22.240 --> 12:23.760
She kept saying,

12:23.800 --> 12:27.200
"Travis, promise me you won't spend
the rest of your life alone."

12:29.480 --> 12:30.560
Yeah.

12:32.280 --> 12:34.120
She said that to me too.

12:38.320 --> 12:40.360
She also said,

12:40.400 --> 12:44.480
"Please don't let Travis date any
of your trashy college friends."

12:46.280 --> 12:47.320
Yeah.

12:47.360 --> 12:49.360
She loved you so much.

12:49.400 --> 12:51.560
Not as much as she loved you.

12:51.600 --> 12:52.840
Yeah.

12:52.880 --> 12:54.680
Not gonna argue with you on that.

12:56.440 --> 12:59.960
Look, when I meet someone
and I have the same look on my face

13:00.000 --> 13:01.880
as you have on yours right now,

13:01.920 --> 13:05.080
then I'll know it's time
to move forward. OK?

13:06.080 --> 13:07.360
Yeah.

13:07.400 --> 13:08.920
Sounds good.

13:14.400 --> 13:16.000
Back to work, punk.

13:16.040 --> 13:17.040
Baa!

13:18.840 --> 13:20.720
We've got the basement today too.

13:20.760 --> 13:23.360
Great! Be ready.

13:27.120 --> 13:30.880
Did he have to let all of New York
City get destroyed in the process?!

13:30.920 --> 13:34.880
It's a superhero movie! Can't
you just enjoy the explosions and
destruction like everybody else?

13:34.920 --> 13:37.600
Of course not! Then I couldn't
bother you with my questions. Oh!

13:37.640 --> 13:39.560
Speaking of loving someone...

13:39.600 --> 13:42.200
Hi. ..and then having it
get destroyed...

13:42.240 --> 13:44.040
..what happened to that guy?

13:44.080 --> 13:45.920
That guy you were dating.

13:45.960 --> 13:49.520
Really? That's your segue? Lame.
So lame!

13:49.560 --> 13:50.760
The lamest!

13:50.800 --> 13:52.680
I'm kidding. Um...

13:52.720 --> 13:55.640
Well, you know,
he was perfect on paper.

13:55.680 --> 13:58.400
He was kind, considerate, funny.

13:58.440 --> 14:00.080
A successful psychotherapist.

14:00.120 --> 14:01.640
Oh, no! Not a therapist.

14:01.680 --> 14:03.600
Yeah, but he didn't
take his own advice

14:03.640 --> 14:05.840
because about a year and a half in,
he stopped calling.

14:05.880 --> 14:07.520
He stopped returning my calls.

14:07.560 --> 14:09.800
He just disappeared, I guess.

14:14.240 --> 14:16.040
So, what about girlfriends?

14:16.080 --> 14:18.520
Oh, my best girlfriend's Ashley.

14:18.560 --> 14:21.280
You'll meet her if you come to
Travis and my anniversary party.

14:21.320 --> 14:23.520
If I'm not on a plane I'll be there.
OK.

14:23.560 --> 14:25.440
What about you, huh?

14:25.480 --> 14:27.760
What about your past relationships?

14:27.800 --> 14:30.640
There wasn't anyone before you.

14:30.680 --> 14:32.320
Good one!

14:32.360 --> 14:34.800
Well, my last girlfriend, Phoebe,

14:34.840 --> 14:37.240
was smart, funny, gorgeous...

14:37.280 --> 14:39.200
Not as gorgeous as you...

14:40.640 --> 14:42.640
..but after five months, we
realised

14:42.680 --> 14:45.080
we liked each other
better as friends.

14:45.120 --> 14:48.600
There was no chemistry.
Nothing you can do about that.

14:48.640 --> 14:49.800
No.

14:49.840 --> 14:52.280
It's not a problem with us. No.

14:56.240 --> 14:58.880
I want you to know
that I'm not going anywhere.

15:00.920 --> 15:03.960
I'm not going to disappear
like that other guy did.

15:04.000 --> 15:06.520
What I'm trying to say is,

15:06.560 --> 15:10.000
I really like being with you,
and that...

15:11.360 --> 15:15.160
..there's something about you
and about us that's special...

15:16.600 --> 15:18.280
..and I'm falling for you.

15:22.040 --> 15:23.560
Feel the same way.

15:23.600 --> 15:24.600
Yeah?

15:32.480 --> 15:34.320
But I hate your work schedule.

15:34.360 --> 15:35.920
I really hate it.

15:35.960 --> 15:37.280
It's the worst.

15:37.320 --> 15:40.120
So, this may be a bad time

15:40.160 --> 15:43.040
to bring up the fact
that I have to go back out

15:43.080 --> 15:45.520
first flight tomorrow, but then
I'll be back by Wednesday.

15:45.560 --> 15:47.680
OK. Hope it's not going
to happen every week.

15:47.720 --> 15:50.000
Well, it's not going to
happen every week... Christian!

15:50.040 --> 15:52.960
It's Henry! How are you doing?

15:53.000 --> 15:55.560
I can't believe it! I was just
thinking about you today.

15:55.600 --> 15:57.880
That's weird. I don't know.
Give me a second.

15:57.920 --> 16:00.160
How are you doing?
How long's it been?

16:00.200 --> 16:03.800
THEY CHAT OUT OF EARSHOT

16:05.360 --> 16:08.560
I don't know! He was convinced
I was a friend of his.

16:08.600 --> 16:10.800
I guess I have one of those faces.

16:10.840 --> 16:12.960
I don't think you have
one of those faces anyway.

16:13.000 --> 16:15.240
Hey, let's get out of here.
Let's go to dinner.

16:15.280 --> 16:16.880
We're running late. OK?

16:21.280 --> 16:22.880
Give me two. Two.

16:22.920 --> 16:25.840
Thank you. Come on! Two.

16:25.880 --> 16:27.280
Coming at you.

16:30.040 --> 16:32.840
OK. So, what's the deal
with this party?

16:32.880 --> 16:34.280
Well, it's at Melissa's house,

16:34.320 --> 16:36.760
so you've pretty much just got to
show up and dress nice.

16:36.800 --> 16:40.080
I'm gonna do some awesome
flower arrangements.

16:40.120 --> 16:42.800
I was thinking about doing some
lighting in the back yard,

16:42.840 --> 16:45.360
maybe some candle display,
something like that.

16:45.400 --> 16:47.320
Nice. How's that sound?

16:48.480 --> 16:50.520
Melissa? Hm? Hey!

16:50.560 --> 16:51.760
What? Oh, sorry.

16:51.800 --> 16:53.040
Oh, hi.

16:53.080 --> 16:54.320
Hi. Hi.

16:54.360 --> 16:56.880
So, how long has he been gone
this time?

16:56.920 --> 16:59.920
How do you know he's been gone?
Because you're depressed. I'm not!

16:59.960 --> 17:02.600
Yes, you are.
It's officially predictable.

17:02.640 --> 17:04.880
I mean, I miss him,
but I'm not depressed.

17:04.920 --> 17:08.760
That's a bit dramatic. Every time
he's gone, you're bummed out.

17:08.800 --> 17:10.200
Waaah.

17:10.240 --> 17:12.560
OK, fine.

17:12.600 --> 17:15.480
I hate it when he's gone
on these long trips.

17:15.520 --> 17:18.680
Am I crazy? I mean, it's only
been a couple months.

17:18.720 --> 17:20.240
You're in love!

17:20.280 --> 17:21.960
I wouldn't go that far.

17:23.040 --> 17:25.560
I would. I see how you are
when he's around.

17:25.600 --> 17:27.240
It's the same way I was around Beth.

17:29.160 --> 17:31.080
My cell isn't working.

17:31.120 --> 17:33.200
I'm gonna go post something.

17:33.240 --> 17:36.520
Ah, because it's been a whole
20 minutes since your last post!

17:36.560 --> 17:37.840
I'm getting itchy.

17:37.880 --> 17:40.560
You're not getting any service here!

17:40.600 --> 17:43.280
Bye! Give me two.

17:45.280 --> 17:46.920
So, do you love this guy, or what?

17:48.080 --> 17:49.200
What?

17:50.160 --> 17:51.440
You heard me.

17:53.840 --> 17:55.560
I think so.

17:56.720 --> 17:58.560
I'm happy for you.

17:58.600 --> 18:00.400
Oh, yeah!

18:00.440 --> 18:02.480
You look really happy for me
right now.

18:02.520 --> 18:04.120
What's up?

18:04.160 --> 18:06.720
I just want you to be careful.

18:06.760 --> 18:08.120
What do you mean, careful?

18:09.560 --> 18:11.680
He's weird, that's all.

18:11.720 --> 18:14.320
What does that mean? There's just
something off about him.

18:14.360 --> 18:17.680
I don't quite know how to describe
it. OK, Mr Overprotective.

18:17.720 --> 18:19.200
He's fine.

18:19.240 --> 18:20.440
We're fine.

18:20.480 --> 18:21.760
I'm fine.

18:21.800 --> 18:24.800
Maybe I'm overprotective,
but I can't help it.

18:24.840 --> 18:26.960
And, for the record,

18:27.000 --> 18:29.280
in my eyes, no guy's ever going
to be good enough for you.

18:30.760 --> 18:31.880
Oh, that's sweet.

18:31.920 --> 18:33.560
That's why I love you.

18:35.000 --> 18:38.200
You know, Travis, I haven't been
this happy in a really long time.

18:38.240 --> 18:41.360
I know. Can you just
let me be happy, please?

18:42.440 --> 18:44.360
OK. OK.

18:44.400 --> 18:46.840
I'm calling this.
Let's just go all in.

18:46.880 --> 18:49.240
All in?! All in. Oh, wow!

18:49.280 --> 18:51.160
Trips... Wait, you won!

18:51.200 --> 18:53.320
Boom! You get all the cards! I won!

19:03.280 --> 19:06.920
CHILDREN PLAYING

19:17.560 --> 19:21.200
CHOKING

19:32.680 --> 19:34.520
Travis! Hey!

19:34.560 --> 19:36.920
Just finishing up the install
on the stove here.

19:36.960 --> 19:39.400
Ah, great. Is Melissa around?
Over here.

19:41.080 --> 19:44.120
Hey! I missed you. I missed you.

19:45.640 --> 19:46.680
Oh!

19:46.720 --> 19:49.200
CLATTERING
Sorry!

19:52.560 --> 19:54.520
Wish you didn't have to go
away tomorrow.

20:23.000 --> 20:24.920
Hi. Hi. Can I help you?

20:24.960 --> 20:26.520
Yeah, I tried ringing the doorbell.

20:26.560 --> 20:29.720
Oh, I'm sorry, I was vacuuming.
I couldn't hear anything.

20:29.760 --> 20:32.920
I was just wondering
if John is home.

20:32.960 --> 20:36.520
No. No, John isn't at the moment.
But he does live here?

20:36.560 --> 20:38.240
Yeah. I'm sorry what was your name?

20:38.280 --> 20:39.960
Are you his wife?

20:42.000 --> 20:43.480
Who are you?

20:43.520 --> 20:45.240
I'm an old acquaintance.

20:45.280 --> 20:46.760
Oh, OK.

20:46.800 --> 20:49.520
Well, if you tell me your name
I can tell John you...

20:49.560 --> 20:52.360
No. No, that's not going
to be necessary.

20:52.400 --> 20:53.400
OK.

20:54.880 --> 20:58.640
Listen, if you are involved
with John, you're not safe.

20:58.680 --> 21:00.000
He's dangerous.

21:00.040 --> 21:02.760
Just... Careful how close
you get to him.

21:04.080 --> 21:06.720
You still haven't told me
who you are.

21:06.760 --> 21:08.800
John and I used to date.

21:10.680 --> 21:11.720
Oh.

21:13.320 --> 21:15.200
But that's over, right?

21:15.240 --> 21:17.440
Yes, of course.

21:17.480 --> 21:19.920
I broke up with him four months ago.

21:19.960 --> 21:21.320
So, what are you doing here?

21:23.600 --> 21:26.840
You're not going to... OK. I'll tell
John his ex girlfriend stopped by.

21:28.440 --> 21:29.960
He attacked me.

21:31.480 --> 21:32.760
What?

21:34.040 --> 21:36.520
He started stalking me
after we broke up.

21:36.560 --> 21:40.400
And then, one night I was leaving
my house and he attacked me.

21:40.440 --> 21:43.800
Luckily I was meeting a girlfriend
for drinks and she found me,

21:43.840 --> 21:46.640
I was lucky, but you might not be.

21:48.280 --> 21:51.360
We can't possibly be talking about
the same John that I'm dating.

21:51.400 --> 21:52.880
So you are seeing him?

21:52.920 --> 21:54.600
That's none of your business.

21:54.640 --> 21:58.360
He didn't go by "John Anderson"
when we were together, he went by

21:58.400 --> 22:00.240
Philip, and then three months ago,

22:00.280 --> 22:02.640
he moved to Los Angeles
and changed his name to John.

22:02.680 --> 22:04.880
OK. Please, you have to believe me!

22:04.920 --> 22:06.920
You need to leave right now.

22:10.080 --> 22:13.360
I know this sounds crazy.
I know that I sound crazy,

22:13.400 --> 22:15.280
but I promise you, I'm not.

22:15.320 --> 22:18.480
Just trust me, you are in danger.
Please go!

22:23.360 --> 22:24.800
Call me.

22:25.880 --> 22:29.080
Just... Don't hesitate to call me.

23:14.760 --> 23:16.720
DOORBELL

23:31.600 --> 23:34.040
Hey! Hey. Come in.
Thanks for coming.

23:34.080 --> 23:35.400
Yeah.

23:40.160 --> 23:42.960
You OK?
I mean, I'm in a bit of shock.

23:43.000 --> 23:45.800
From what you told me on the
phone, she sounds like a stalker...

23:45.840 --> 23:48.280
I've known John for months.
He's a solid guy,

23:48.320 --> 23:51.400
and suddenly his ex-girlfriend shows
up to scare off the new girlfriend.

23:51.440 --> 23:53.840
That's weird, right? Mm.

23:53.880 --> 23:56.440
I mean, she's a lunatic
or something.

23:56.480 --> 23:57.760
She sounds a bit off.

23:57.800 --> 24:00.800
But John... I'm not sure John
is as perfect as you think he is.

24:00.840 --> 24:04.840
OK, nobody's perfect, but I don't
think he would ever hurt anybody.

24:04.880 --> 24:06.200
Did you check him out online?

24:06.240 --> 24:08.760
Of course!
Standard dating protocol.

24:08.800 --> 24:11.000
His social media
came up totally normal.

24:11.040 --> 24:13.520
Just some pictures of him
golfing with friends

24:13.560 --> 24:15.680
and some really cute pics
of his family.

24:15.720 --> 24:18.240
Has he ever shown anger or
violent tendencies, or...?

24:18.280 --> 24:19.560
Really?

24:21.640 --> 24:23.840
No, of course not.

24:23.880 --> 24:26.440
All I'm saying is, what if
she is telling the truth?

24:26.480 --> 24:27.960
Travis, he's really good to me.

24:28.000 --> 24:31.320
I'd tell you if there was something
wrong. There's nothing wrong.

24:31.360 --> 24:34.600
OK. I'm just concerned.
Don't get mad. Sorry.

24:34.640 --> 24:38.040
Why don't we check out her social
media, see what we can find out?

24:38.080 --> 24:39.560
That's a good idea.

24:39.600 --> 24:41.840
Yeah. My computer's over there.

24:46.600 --> 24:49.760
OK. Sorry I yelled at you.

24:51.400 --> 24:52.880
That's OK.

24:54.160 --> 24:57.760
Now, what's her name?
Um, Carrie Avery.

25:00.080 --> 25:02.840
Is that her? No.

25:02.880 --> 25:04.640
That's her.

25:04.680 --> 25:07.720
'Philip, if you're reading this, you
will pay for what you did to me.

25:07.760 --> 25:09.840
'The police have arrested
the wrong person.

25:09.880 --> 25:11.200
'They didn't do their job

25:11.240 --> 25:13.720
'and Philip Anderson
is still on the loose.'

25:13.760 --> 25:16.000
These posts, they just go on and on.

25:16.040 --> 25:18.000
My God.

25:19.600 --> 25:22.200
She's from Tawny, California.

25:23.240 --> 25:25.800
Maybe I should call the Tawny
police department tomorrow

25:25.840 --> 25:28.640
see if I can find out any
information. That's a good idea.

25:31.120 --> 25:32.960
Do you want to get food tonight?

25:33.000 --> 25:34.920
No, I'm beat.

25:34.960 --> 25:37.600
Think I'm just going to take a bath.
OK.

25:39.600 --> 25:42.080
I'll just... I'll head out.

25:42.120 --> 25:44.720
Pick you up in the morning. OK.

25:46.160 --> 25:47.840
Bye. Bye.

26:37.440 --> 26:39.240
It's Carrie Avery.

26:39.280 --> 26:41.680
A-V-E-R-Y.

26:41.720 --> 26:42.920
Yes, I can hold.

26:47.400 --> 26:50.560
Hey. I just got off the phone
with the officer

26:50.600 --> 26:52.120
who investigated Carrie's attack.

26:52.160 --> 26:55.600
Really? Yeah. He said that there was
a mugging in town the same week.

26:55.640 --> 26:58.160
The guy they arrested
had a pair of gloves at his house

26:58.200 --> 27:00.200
with Carrie's hair on them.
What about Carrie?

27:00.240 --> 27:02.600
Did they say anything about her
thinking John was her assailant?

27:02.640 --> 27:04.120
Yes. Despite DNA evidence,

27:04.160 --> 27:07.160
she insisted that John was the
one that attacked her. What?!

27:07.200 --> 27:10.560
Yeah, the cop said that she
was obsessed with Philip Anderson,

27:10.600 --> 27:12.960
and when he broke up with her,
she wanted revenge.

27:13.000 --> 27:16.360
Then he told me that she's crazy
and I should stay away from her.

27:16.400 --> 27:18.000
OK. Clearly she's dangerous.

27:18.040 --> 27:21.640
If she comes around again, you've
got to call me immediately, OK? OK.

27:21.680 --> 27:23.440
Got some screws loose.

27:26.480 --> 27:28.480
I don't know, though...

27:28.520 --> 27:30.760
Hey, you OK?

27:30.800 --> 27:34.560
Yeah. It's just this whole John
Anderson, Philip Anderson thing.

27:34.600 --> 27:36.760
It's odd. I'm over-thinking,
aren't I?

27:36.800 --> 27:40.040
I'd probably change my first name
if my ex started stalking me.

27:40.080 --> 27:42.600
Yeah. Are you going to talk to John?

27:42.640 --> 27:44.560
Yeah, I'm going to ask him
about all this.

27:44.600 --> 27:47.360
It's not like he'll tell the truth
if he was lying the entire time.

27:47.400 --> 27:49.800
He's not lying, Travis. You heard
what the police said.

27:49.840 --> 27:52.200
She's crazy.
Still, when you talk to him,

27:52.240 --> 27:53.960
it should be somewhere public. OK?

27:54.000 --> 27:56.920
You shouldn't be alone when you talk
to him, or to her for that matter.

27:56.960 --> 27:58.400
You're right.

27:58.440 --> 27:59.840
I invited him to our party.

27:59.880 --> 28:01.920
If he shows up,
I'll ask him about it.

28:01.960 --> 28:03.160
Good.

28:04.800 --> 28:08.840
LOUD MUSIC PUMPS

28:33.880 --> 28:36.640
Oh, wow! Thank you!

28:37.920 --> 28:39.720
I'm surprised you made it!

28:39.760 --> 28:42.160
It's a big deal, third anniversary
of your company.

28:42.200 --> 28:43.600
I wouldn't miss it. Oh!

28:43.640 --> 28:46.000
How was your trip? Flight
to New York, car to the hotel,

28:46.040 --> 28:48.520
wake up in the hotel, airport,
flight to London,

28:48.560 --> 28:49.920
then Paris, then Geneva.

28:49.960 --> 28:53.600
More hotels. Really, it's all
tedious till I get back to you.

28:55.680 --> 28:57.640
Thanks. Wow.

28:57.680 --> 29:01.800
London, Paris, Geneva! How
exciting, all the places you see.

29:01.840 --> 29:05.040
It would be, but I'm always working
so I don't get to see anything!

29:05.080 --> 29:08.840
Which is why, next month,
I'm going to take us to Paris.

29:08.880 --> 29:11.280
What? Are you serious?

29:11.320 --> 29:12.720
Paris?

29:12.760 --> 29:15.480
Well, I get free airfares, so the
only thing I had to do was book

29:15.520 --> 29:17.960
the penthouse at the Ritz.
The penthouse? Mm!

29:18.000 --> 29:19.920
Excuse me, everyone.

29:19.960 --> 29:21.600
I'd like to propose a toast

29:21.640 --> 29:25.000
to my magnificent and talented
business partner, Melissa,

29:25.040 --> 29:26.920
who is not only a visionary,

29:26.960 --> 29:29.760
but also knows how to throw
a damn good party!

29:31.440 --> 29:32.960
Come here for a second.

29:33.000 --> 29:34.520
Come over here.

29:34.560 --> 29:37.960
CHEERING

29:39.640 --> 29:42.840
OK, so in celebration of our
three years together...

29:42.880 --> 29:45.040
Three years. Wow. Wow. Yeah.

29:45.080 --> 29:46.720
Yeah! Yeah.

29:46.760 --> 29:50.440
..I'd like to present to you
a token of my undying gratitude.

29:52.080 --> 29:54.480
Oh, no! Yeah.

29:54.520 --> 29:55.960
OK, I'll open it.

29:56.000 --> 29:58.200
I'm going to open it right now.

29:58.240 --> 30:00.280
Oh, my gosh!

30:01.600 --> 30:03.640
It's a bedazzle box cutter!

30:03.680 --> 30:04.800
Thank you!

30:04.840 --> 30:07.240
This is really the coolest gift.

30:07.280 --> 30:09.640
This is what every woman
would ever wish for.

30:09.680 --> 30:12.920
At least me! Right. You'll never
have to use mine ever again!

30:12.960 --> 30:14.960
That's right. I have my own!

30:16.120 --> 30:17.320
Cheers, everybody.

30:17.360 --> 30:19.040
ALL: Cheers!

30:21.000 --> 30:23.080
Congratulations!

30:23.120 --> 30:26.760
So proud of you,
congratulations!

30:26.800 --> 30:29.240
You nailed it. Oh, yeah.

30:29.280 --> 30:30.640
Good, good!

30:32.520 --> 30:35.160
Oh, thank you, so much.

30:35.200 --> 30:38.000
Did you talk to him?

30:38.040 --> 30:41.600
No, I didn't. He just got here,
so I'm giving him a second.

30:41.640 --> 30:44.560
Go talk to him. Er...

30:45.960 --> 30:47.200
All right.

30:50.680 --> 30:52.560
Here I go. Go get 'em.

30:55.000 --> 30:57.480
Hey, what are you doing
out here by yourself?

30:57.520 --> 30:59.360
Who knew that
the way to a girl's heart

30:59.400 --> 31:00.840
was through construction tools?!

31:00.880 --> 31:01.920
Oh, yeah!

31:01.960 --> 31:04.200
Oh, man, he really gets me,
doesn't he?

31:04.240 --> 31:05.760
You two have a special relationship.

31:05.800 --> 31:07.480
Yeah, we do.

31:07.520 --> 31:09.160
Makes me a little jealous.

31:09.200 --> 31:12.080
What? Oh, no. Don't be ridiculous.

31:12.120 --> 31:14.400
Hey, at least you've met Travis.

31:14.440 --> 31:16.720
I haven't even met
any of your friends.

31:16.760 --> 31:18.200
I didn't know you were interested.

31:18.240 --> 31:20.880
Of course I am! I feel like
there's so much about you

31:20.920 --> 31:22.160
that I don't even know.

31:22.200 --> 31:24.880
I don't know anything
about your past relationships.

31:24.920 --> 31:26.680
I told you about Phoebe.

31:26.720 --> 31:29.440
That's it. It's my only
significant relationship.

31:29.480 --> 31:31.520
And there wasn't anybody else?

31:31.560 --> 31:34.080
Well now, that is a loaded question!

31:34.120 --> 31:36.320
What do you want to know?

31:36.360 --> 31:38.920
I want to know about Carrie Avery.

31:41.400 --> 31:43.160
I don't know who that is.

31:43.200 --> 31:45.880
You never dated a girl named Carrie?

31:47.400 --> 31:51.480
I don't know where you're going with
this, but it's a little concerning.

31:51.520 --> 31:53.400
OK, er...

31:53.440 --> 31:55.840
..a woman showed up at your house
when you were gone.

31:55.880 --> 31:58.960
She said she used to date you
and she wanted to talk to you.

32:01.640 --> 32:03.480
I don't know Carrie, I swear.

32:03.520 --> 32:05.160
Maybe you know her from Montana?

32:05.200 --> 32:07.880
What? Why Montana?

32:09.120 --> 32:11.480
That's where you said
you're from, right?

32:13.680 --> 32:16.760
Yes, but I don't know Carrie
from Montana.

32:16.800 --> 32:18.840
What did you tell her?

32:18.880 --> 32:21.680
I just told her that you were gone.
What else did you tell her?

32:23.040 --> 32:27.200
I didn't tell her anything, John.
You're sure? Yeah.

32:30.520 --> 32:34.360
Look, I'm sorry, but I don't know
who that could have been.

32:34.400 --> 32:38.480
It's no big deal. I just I want
our private life to be private.

32:39.640 --> 32:42.200
Yeah, sure. OK? Mm.

32:42.240 --> 32:43.640
What did she tell you?

32:44.800 --> 32:46.680
She...

32:46.720 --> 32:48.720
I mean, it's hysterical.

32:48.760 --> 32:52.200
She said that she broke up with you
and then you stalked her

32:52.240 --> 32:53.600
and attacked her.

32:54.880 --> 32:56.480
What else did she tell you?

32:58.680 --> 33:02.040
Because it's absolutely not true.

33:02.080 --> 33:04.080
I will find out who she is.

33:04.120 --> 33:07.840
But in the meantime, I don't want
you working at the house alone.

33:10.240 --> 33:11.400
OK.

33:11.440 --> 33:14.240
It's fine though,
I'm not afraid of her.

33:14.280 --> 33:16.480
I don't think she's coming back.
Where was Travis?

33:16.520 --> 33:18.000
You want me to go talk to him?

33:18.040 --> 33:20.960
No, you don't have to talk to him.
I already told him, OK?

33:21.000 --> 33:23.600
Just forget that I ever
brought it up. OK?

33:23.640 --> 33:27.040
Let's go to the party, OK? I want
you to meet my best friend Ashley.

33:27.080 --> 33:29.800
I've been telling you about her,
remember? All right.

33:29.840 --> 33:32.080
She's so much fun.
I've told her all about you.

33:32.120 --> 33:36.000
You're not going to believe the
things that come out of her mouth!

33:37.760 --> 33:39.400
But she's sweet.

33:39.440 --> 33:40.880
She's very successful.

33:40.920 --> 33:45.160
OK, here he comes, here he comes,
this is what I've been waiting for!

33:45.200 --> 33:47.600
Ashley, this is John.
Hi, John! Act natural.

33:47.640 --> 33:50.480
My name is Ashley.
I've heard a lot about you.

33:50.520 --> 33:53.720
Well! If you heard good things,
they are all true.

33:53.760 --> 33:55.680
Wow! Well, I will be right back.

33:55.720 --> 33:57.040
Excuse me. Of course.

33:57.080 --> 33:59.080
OK! Thank you. Oh, my goodness.

33:59.120 --> 34:02.160
Is your night going OK?
Yeah, it's going great!

34:02.200 --> 34:04.840
We need to get to know
each other a lot better.

34:04.880 --> 34:07.400
We can! Can I get you
something to drink? Yes!

34:07.440 --> 34:10.280
Chardonnay, please. And snacks while
you're at it, if you don't mind.

34:10.320 --> 34:13.120
Coming up. Great, thanks!
You're such a gentleman.

34:15.480 --> 34:16.960
What happened?

34:17.000 --> 34:18.480
OK. He seemed really rattled,

34:18.520 --> 34:20.920
and he didn't even remember
telling me he was from Montana.

34:20.960 --> 34:23.360
Why would you lie about where
you're from? I don't know.

34:23.400 --> 34:25.640
I don't know if he's the one
that attacked Carrie,

34:25.680 --> 34:27.200
but I know he's hiding something.

34:27.240 --> 34:29.880
Are you sure though? Yeah, I'm sure.

34:29.920 --> 34:32.320
I think... I mean,

34:32.360 --> 34:35.400
I don't know. I think I'm sure.

34:35.440 --> 34:36.760
Am I just being paranoid?

34:36.800 --> 34:39.560
You have to trust your instincts.
We've got to look into this dude.

34:39.600 --> 34:42.080
Maybe you should call
that girl. Carrie? Yeah.

34:42.120 --> 34:44.440
Try to find out everything
she claims to know about John.

34:44.480 --> 34:46.800
Look, we're going to get through
this, OK?

34:50.800 --> 34:53.720
Everything OK? John, you scared me!

34:53.760 --> 34:55.360
I'm sorry. Why would I scare you?

34:55.400 --> 34:59.360
No, you didn't. I mean,
the door just flew open. It's fine.

34:59.400 --> 35:01.000
I was looking all over for you.

35:01.040 --> 35:02.880
You guys sure everything's OK?

35:02.920 --> 35:06.840
Yeah! Yeah, we were just
having a moment of reflection

35:06.880 --> 35:08.680
on our three year journey together.

35:08.720 --> 35:11.040
Sorry to keep your girl.

35:11.080 --> 35:13.400
Oh, I don't mind sharing
her with you, Travis.

35:17.800 --> 35:19.520
Well, we should go back
to the party.

35:20.680 --> 35:23.480
Actually, I've got
some work to catch up on,

35:23.520 --> 35:26.520
so I was going to tell you that
I'm heading out. Busy day tomorrow.

35:30.160 --> 35:32.120
Yeah. But thanks for inviting me.

35:32.160 --> 35:34.360
It was great to celebrate
with both of you.

35:34.400 --> 35:36.760
Travis and I'll be working
at your house tomorrow.

35:36.800 --> 35:38.840
Good. I don't want
you working there alone.

35:39.960 --> 35:41.320
You won't be there?

35:44.080 --> 35:45.440
I'll be in and out.

35:46.520 --> 35:51.120
Oh, OK. Well, listen,
if I don't see you tomorrow

35:51.160 --> 35:53.720
then I'll just give you a call.
Do that.

36:14.200 --> 36:15.920
Look what I found. Oh, great!

36:15.960 --> 36:17.720
You put them on the bed? Yeah.

36:17.760 --> 36:22.240
Can I borrow your knife?
Oh, wait for it, wait for it!

36:22.280 --> 36:23.760
Oh... Wait for it.

36:23.800 --> 36:25.000
I'm so proud of you right now.

36:25.040 --> 36:26.080
Boom!

36:26.120 --> 36:31.160
Boom! This is a great day.
Really great. Shut up!

36:32.520 --> 36:34.680
Oh, no!

36:34.720 --> 36:36.320
Did I order these colours?

36:36.360 --> 36:39.360
How's it coming? Hey!

36:39.400 --> 36:40.960
Um...

36:42.800 --> 36:46.800
Do you like the pillow? Er...
They're bright. Colourful.

36:46.840 --> 36:49.400
I think we should say no
to the pillows.

36:49.440 --> 36:52.920
So, I'm gonna go run errands
for a little bit, but I'll be home

36:52.960 --> 36:54.840
if you want to have dinner
before my flight?

36:54.880 --> 36:56.920
Oh, I think that
we'll probably be working here.

36:56.960 --> 36:58.840
Hope so.

37:07.480 --> 37:09.480
Did you have a chance
to check his car?

37:09.520 --> 37:11.320
No, he's been circling like a hawk.

37:11.360 --> 37:13.440
I'll check when he gets back. OK.

37:13.480 --> 37:15.800
You should go check out
the office right now. Yeah.

37:15.840 --> 37:18.040
Good call. Will you just
keep an eye out for him?

37:18.080 --> 37:20.600
I'll watch the garage.
OK, I'll be right back.

37:57.320 --> 38:00.160
Hotel, hotel... Melford?

38:11.600 --> 38:12.920
Hey!

38:12.960 --> 38:14.880
Hey! I thought
you were running errands.

38:14.920 --> 38:16.960
I was until I realised
I'd left my wallet.

38:18.240 --> 38:21.760
Did you see Travis? He's hanging
lights in the guest bedroom.

38:23.560 --> 38:26.280
No, I didn't because I came in
through the back.

38:26.320 --> 38:28.280
What were you looking for
on my desk?

38:28.320 --> 38:31.040
Oh, I need to find
a pair of scissors

38:31.080 --> 38:33.800
because one of the drapes is a
little bit longer than the other,

38:33.840 --> 38:35.280
you probably didn't even notice.

38:37.120 --> 38:38.720
Are you sure everything's OK?

38:38.760 --> 38:40.320
Yeah, why wouldn't it be?

38:41.440 --> 38:44.320
You seem anxious. I do? Oh.

38:45.400 --> 38:47.000
I mean, I'm a little anxious.

38:47.040 --> 38:49.280
I just want to make sure
we finish on time.

38:49.320 --> 38:51.200
I think our
extracurricular activities

38:51.240 --> 38:53.600
have slowed us down a bit.
I'm not in a hurry.

38:53.640 --> 38:57.960
I know, me neither, but I just want
to come in on schedule.

38:58.000 --> 38:59.240
Travis does too.

38:59.280 --> 39:01.040
You're not our only client.

39:02.560 --> 39:06.480
Right. I understand, but you'd
tell me if something was wrong?

39:06.520 --> 39:08.360
Mm, yeah! Of course.

39:08.400 --> 39:10.200
OK.

39:16.360 --> 39:18.240
Hey, Mel?

39:18.280 --> 39:19.920
Hey, there you are.

39:19.960 --> 39:23.240
I need your eyes
on the guest room first.

39:23.280 --> 39:24.800
Duty calls.

39:27.720 --> 39:29.800
Thanks. Scissors.

39:36.360 --> 39:38.600
Thanks for meeting me. Of course.

39:41.600 --> 39:44.560
Well, I talked to John about you.

39:44.600 --> 39:46.080
You did? Wow.

39:46.120 --> 39:47.280
And?

39:47.320 --> 39:48.920
He said he didn't know
who you were.

39:50.440 --> 39:52.960
Course he denied it.
But I know he was lying.

39:55.320 --> 39:58.680
I could see something in his eyes,
some flash of recognition.

39:58.720 --> 40:01.480
I know he was lying,
even though he said he wasn't.

40:01.520 --> 40:03.000
Yeah, well, he thought I was dead.

40:03.040 --> 40:05.920
I'm sure it came as a surprise
to know I'm still alive.

40:05.960 --> 40:09.360
I contacted the Tawny police
department about your case. Good.

40:09.400 --> 40:11.480
That's the first thing
I would have done.

40:11.520 --> 40:14.480
The guy they arrested
was Willie Ross.

40:14.520 --> 40:16.120
He was the town druggie.

40:16.160 --> 40:19.080
He robbed a woman the same week
that I was attacked

40:19.120 --> 40:20.920
and the cops pinned it on him.

40:20.960 --> 40:23.240
What if he did it? No! You see,

40:23.280 --> 40:26.680
John was wearing a pair of gardening
gloves when he attacked me.

40:26.720 --> 40:29.960
They found the gloves in Willie's
apartment with my DNA all over them.

40:30.000 --> 40:32.440
But I know that John
planted them there.

40:32.480 --> 40:34.280
He's vicious and he's smart.

40:34.320 --> 40:36.640
OK. Why did he move here then?

40:36.680 --> 40:39.480
Because he knew the cops
would question him, so he ran.

40:39.520 --> 40:42.400
It was so much worse
not knowing where he was.

40:42.440 --> 40:45.040
Did you tell the police you were
being attacked? Yes, of course.

40:45.080 --> 40:47.360
But he had an ironclad alibi.

40:47.400 --> 40:50.640
He wasn't just trying to scare me,
he was trying to kill me.

40:52.640 --> 40:54.600
The idea of him
doing that to someone else...

40:54.640 --> 40:56.880
Carrie, I'm really sorry
that this happened to you,

40:56.920 --> 41:00.040
but I'm having a really hard time
accepting the fact that this man

41:00.080 --> 41:03.240
that I've been seeing
could do something like this.

41:05.480 --> 41:07.080
He takes long trips.

41:07.120 --> 41:09.960
He's gone for extended
periods of time.

41:10.000 --> 41:13.000
He was always disappearing on me.

41:13.040 --> 41:17.040
He said he was a pilot,
that he travelled for work.

41:17.080 --> 41:18.720
He's not a pilot.

41:21.560 --> 41:23.240
I know John's lying about something.

41:23.280 --> 41:26.160
I just can't believe that
he attacked you. It was dark,

41:26.200 --> 41:27.960
but I can assure you it was him.

41:29.080 --> 41:31.920
If I were you,
I wouldn't wait to find out.

41:34.320 --> 41:38.480
I... I looked through one of
his credit card bills,

41:38.520 --> 41:41.560
and I saw that he's been flying
to Melford every week,

41:41.600 --> 41:43.200
Monday through Thursday,

41:43.240 --> 41:45.520
and coming back here
for the weekends.

41:45.560 --> 41:47.880
What's in Melford? I don't know.

41:47.920 --> 41:49.840
Something you could tell me?

41:51.600 --> 41:54.640
I'm sorry, I've told you
everything that I know.

42:44.040 --> 42:46.520
Here you go. Thank you.
Did you find anything?

42:46.560 --> 42:50.080
Not a lot, but definitely
something we should look into.

42:50.120 --> 42:51.320
He didn't see you, did he?

42:51.360 --> 42:54.080
No. So I went through his car,

42:54.120 --> 42:56.600
and I found some blank legal pads
and some magazines,

42:56.640 --> 42:59.040
and then I found this booklet
from Davrow University.

42:59.080 --> 43:01.840
It had "staff" on the front. I
didn't have time to look through it.

43:01.880 --> 43:04.120
OK. Well, pull up Davrow's website.

43:04.160 --> 43:06.040
Maybe we can find him there.

43:07.760 --> 43:09.720
Go to professors.

43:09.760 --> 43:11.760
Usually they have pictures online.

43:18.520 --> 43:19.800
What...?

43:19.840 --> 43:21.520
Oh, my God.

43:21.560 --> 43:23.280
Who is Christian Wellesley?

43:24.480 --> 43:26.560
That's John!

43:26.600 --> 43:29.360
Christian Wellesley
is head of neuroscience

43:29.400 --> 43:31.840
at Davrow University
in Melford, California.

43:31.880 --> 43:33.600
He's been teaching for 15 years.

43:33.640 --> 43:36.000
He's about to publish
his first book.

43:36.040 --> 43:38.360
John's a neuroscientist?!

43:40.960 --> 43:44.080
The other day at the park, there was
a man that called John Christian,

43:44.120 --> 43:46.600
and John acted like he didn't know
who he was.

43:46.640 --> 43:48.800
Maybe that's why he attacked Carrie.

43:48.840 --> 43:51.480
Maybe he thought that she found out
that he was lying about his life

43:51.520 --> 43:52.760
and that's why she dumped him.

43:52.800 --> 43:54.000
That's impossible.

43:54.040 --> 43:56.720
Look, we don't know who this guy
is, or if this is John, or what,

43:56.760 --> 44:00.280
but we need proof. We need proof
that John is Christian Wellesley.

44:00.320 --> 44:01.600
I have to find out.

44:03.320 --> 44:05.720
Wait, what? Are you crazy?
No, no, no, no!

44:05.760 --> 44:07.840
It's way too dangerous.
Only one way to find out.

44:07.880 --> 44:10.080
I have to go to Davrow University
and see for myself.

44:10.120 --> 44:13.120
We'll call the police. The police
won't do anything, it's not a crime

44:13.160 --> 44:14.680
to change your name. OK...

44:14.720 --> 44:16.280
I'll go.

44:16.320 --> 44:19.280
If I go it's excusable, but if you
are gone, John will be suspicious.

44:19.320 --> 44:22.400
Travis, I should have never let
you get involved in this.

44:22.440 --> 44:23.520
Mel.

44:23.560 --> 44:25.160
Let me help.

44:29.960 --> 44:32.640
All right. He said he was going
on a business trip tonight,

44:32.680 --> 44:34.960
but I'm sure he's
just going back to Melford.

44:35.000 --> 44:38.800
OK, I'll drive up tonight. When I
find something I'll give you a call.

44:38.840 --> 44:41.480
OK? Be careful, all right? OK.

45:06.120 --> 45:08.720
Hey! Shouldn't you
be at the airport? Tonight.

45:08.760 --> 45:10.640
I wanted to see you before I left.

45:10.680 --> 45:15.280
Did you know your doorbell
is broken? No. No, I didn't.

45:17.040 --> 45:19.920
Mind if I come in? Of course.

45:21.200 --> 45:23.880
I called you. Oh, I know.

45:23.920 --> 45:27.440
I got really busy.
Started this really big project.

45:27.480 --> 45:29.760
I'm sorry I didn't call you back.

45:29.800 --> 45:33.080
Is everything all right?
Yeah, of course. Yeah.

45:33.120 --> 45:35.000
Why wouldn't it be?
You just seem on edge,

45:35.040 --> 45:38.120
ever since that woman showed
up at my house. Oh, yeah.

45:38.160 --> 45:42.480
That freaked me out a little bit.
I'm sure you can understand.

45:46.640 --> 45:48.160
Do you mind?

45:48.200 --> 45:49.920
No. Go for it.

45:58.280 --> 46:00.760
Why didn't you tell me
that's what was bothering you?

46:00.800 --> 46:03.440
I thought we talked about all of it
and it was fine.

46:08.280 --> 46:10.000
Yeah, we talked about it.

46:10.040 --> 46:12.160
It's just a little weird.

46:12.200 --> 46:14.080
So...

46:15.520 --> 46:17.600
Things have been moving
quickly between us,

46:17.640 --> 46:19.560
we're still getting
to know one another.

46:19.600 --> 46:21.600
You're still figuring out
if you can trust me,

46:21.640 --> 46:23.400
and that...that has to be earned.

46:23.440 --> 46:26.600
So if you need some space,

46:26.640 --> 46:28.200
I can take a step back.

46:28.240 --> 46:30.560
Yeah. I think... I think so.

46:30.600 --> 46:32.360
I mean, for the both of us.

46:32.400 --> 46:34.480
Slow it down a little bit.

46:41.080 --> 46:44.040
You're an amazing woman.

46:44.080 --> 46:47.360
You're smart, you're funny,
you're talented.

46:47.400 --> 46:49.400
You're worth waiting for.

46:49.440 --> 46:51.200
So I'm not going anywhere.

46:56.360 --> 46:58.840
Now, that is clever.

46:58.880 --> 47:01.200
Why don't I have
one of those in my house?

47:01.240 --> 47:02.800
I will get you one.

47:02.840 --> 47:04.440
That would be great.

47:08.320 --> 47:09.960
Got to catch a flight. OK.

47:10.000 --> 47:11.840
Call me when you're ready.

47:14.240 --> 47:15.600
Bye.

47:52.720 --> 47:54.400
Hi, excuse me? Hi.

47:54.440 --> 47:56.040
Good afternoon. How can I help you?

47:56.080 --> 47:57.640
I was looking for the class schedule

47:57.680 --> 48:00.320
and office hours of
Dr Christian Wellesley.

48:00.360 --> 48:01.760
Are you a student here?

48:01.800 --> 48:02.920
Grad student.

48:02.960 --> 48:04.600
Do you have an appointment?

48:04.640 --> 48:05.800
No.

48:05.840 --> 48:08.080
Then you know how busy
Dr Wellesley is.

48:08.120 --> 48:09.720
No, I did not know that.

48:11.240 --> 48:13.160
I'm feeling generous today.

48:13.200 --> 48:14.680
Here you go.

48:14.720 --> 48:17.480
Contact info is on the sheet.

48:20.360 --> 48:22.040
Thank you so much.

49:00.280 --> 49:02.960
Hey! Watch where you're going!
Sorry.

50:47.600 --> 50:50.000
Oh, my God!

50:50.040 --> 50:51.880
He's married.

50:51.920 --> 50:54.320
How's she doing? She's good.

51:01.560 --> 51:03.120
Come on, come on.

51:05.680 --> 51:07.160
Oh, thank God.

51:07.200 --> 51:09.320
Here we go.

51:09.360 --> 51:12.440
Are you almost ready?
What's your food mood?

51:12.480 --> 51:15.840
Chinese. Ooh, yes, please!

51:15.880 --> 51:18.040
Pick up, pick up, pick up, pick up.

51:18.080 --> 51:19.560
Come on.

51:19.600 --> 51:21.760
Have you seen my phone anywhere?

51:21.800 --> 51:23.040
There it is!

51:23.080 --> 51:24.280
I'll get it.

51:24.320 --> 51:26.920
You finish. Did Travis call.

51:28.160 --> 51:30.440
Yep. Just missed him.

51:37.680 --> 51:39.120
I did? Mm.

51:39.160 --> 51:40.440
Damn.

51:42.320 --> 51:45.200
Straight to voicemail.
Is everything all right?

51:46.440 --> 51:48.880
He went to look for John. Why?
He's working on his house!

51:48.920 --> 51:52.400
Yeah, so... We think that John
might be lying about who he is

51:52.440 --> 51:54.680
and Travis went to find out
if it's true, or not.

51:54.720 --> 51:56.960
Where did he go? Melford.

51:57.000 --> 51:59.760
Oh. The vortex of
no cellphone service.

51:59.800 --> 52:03.120
Girl, my cousin lives there and
even the Wi-Fi is on crutches.

52:03.160 --> 52:04.520
Are you serious? Mmm.

52:04.560 --> 52:06.480
You'll probably
hear from Travis again

52:06.520 --> 52:08.680
when he drives about ten miles
out of town.

52:08.720 --> 52:10.960
I'm really worried about him. Why?

52:11.000 --> 52:13.200
He just doesn't have
cellphone service.

52:13.240 --> 52:16.920
Maybe I should go up there.
Why? What is going on?

52:16.960 --> 52:20.240
It's a long story.
I'll tell you over food.

52:20.280 --> 52:23.760
You'll hear from Travis again
when he realises he's miles away

52:23.800 --> 52:26.000
from any working cellphone tower.

52:31.080 --> 52:32.760
Now, what's going on?

52:32.800 --> 52:35.520
OK, so the other day I was
working at John's house,

52:35.560 --> 52:38.640
and this woman showed up. Oh?
Said that she was his ex...

52:59.120 --> 53:01.560
Honey, you OK? Yeah, I'm fine.

53:03.320 --> 53:04.560
Did you get lost?

53:04.600 --> 53:07.960
You were gone an awfully long time
just for a bottle of wine.

53:08.000 --> 53:10.840
Oh, no. I'm sorry,
I didn't pick up the wine.

53:10.880 --> 53:14.480
I got a call from my booker.
A speaker's dropped out of
conference in LA

53:14.520 --> 53:16.960
and they want me to fill
in tomorrow.

53:17.000 --> 53:18.960
What? You just got back.

53:19.000 --> 53:21.080
I know, I'm sorry,
but it's only two days.

53:21.120 --> 53:23.480
Are you sure you can get
a flight this late?

53:23.520 --> 53:26.280
No, all the flights are booked
so I'll have to drive,

53:26.320 --> 53:29.520
which means I have to get my
suitcase, which means that... Hi.

53:31.560 --> 53:34.720
No. I'll make it up to you, OK?

53:37.080 --> 53:39.440
Can I help you get anything?
No, I'm good.

53:39.480 --> 53:41.200
I'll call you when I get there.

53:41.240 --> 53:42.680
Drive safe.

54:01.200 --> 54:03.480
Come on.

54:03.520 --> 54:04.600
Travis.

54:07.000 --> 54:08.840
FOOTSTEPS APPROACH

54:08.880 --> 54:11.000
Hey! Oh, God! I'm sorry!

54:11.040 --> 54:13.800
John, you scared me!
I don't mean to scare you.

54:13.840 --> 54:15.600
You did!

54:15.640 --> 54:17.520
I thought you had a flight.

54:17.560 --> 54:18.840
It got cancelled.

54:18.880 --> 54:20.880
Oh, OK.

54:23.400 --> 54:25.960
You following me or something, John?

54:26.000 --> 54:27.760
Why would I follow you?

54:27.800 --> 54:29.520
I didn't know you ran here.

54:29.560 --> 54:31.520
Never seen you here before.

54:31.560 --> 54:34.640
I though we were supposed to be
taking some time from each other.

54:36.600 --> 54:38.440
I know. I'm just going for a run.

54:38.480 --> 54:39.920
PHONE RINGS

54:39.960 --> 54:41.200
Sorry.

54:41.240 --> 54:42.520
Hello?

54:42.560 --> 54:43.960
This is she.

54:47.400 --> 54:48.720
What?

54:50.120 --> 54:52.080
Oh, my God. When?

54:52.120 --> 54:53.880
Um...

54:56.000 --> 54:58.200
Is he OK?

55:00.680 --> 55:01.920
OK, er...

55:03.160 --> 55:05.000
Yeah, I'm gonna...

55:05.040 --> 55:06.920
I'll be right there.

55:09.120 --> 55:11.560
That was Travis's dad.
Travis was in a car accident.

55:11.600 --> 55:13.120
Oh, my God. Is he all right? No.

55:13.160 --> 55:15.200
He...he...he... He drove off
a roadside cliff

55:15.240 --> 55:17.600
and he was thrown from his car.
I'm so sorry.

55:17.640 --> 55:19.960
He was airlifted
to Los Angeles for surgery.

55:20.000 --> 55:22.320
They don't know if he'll make it.
What can I do?

55:22.360 --> 55:25.360
I don't know.
I have to go see him, I think...

55:25.400 --> 55:27.680
You shouldn't drive right now,
you're upset.

55:27.720 --> 55:30.320
What are you doing, John? Let go.
Let me drive you. Let me drive.

55:30.360 --> 55:32.200
OK, you're hurting me.

55:32.240 --> 55:33.960
No, I'm protecting you.
John, let go of me!

55:34.000 --> 55:36.440
You're upset. You shouldn't
drive because it's dangerous.

55:36.480 --> 55:37.640
Let me...!

55:46.040 --> 55:47.720
Yes, I understand that.

55:47.760 --> 55:51.080
'I'm sorry, ma'am. He's going to be
in surgery for at least two hours.'

55:51.120 --> 55:52.120
OK.

55:52.160 --> 55:54.840
Can you just please tell me
what kind of surgery he's having?

55:54.880 --> 55:57.200
I just want to make sure
that he's OK.

55:57.240 --> 55:59.800
'Sorry, all I can tell you is that
it'll be a few more hours.'

56:00.920 --> 56:02.720
OK. Thank you.

56:20.840 --> 56:23.680
Hey, it's Melissa.
Can you come and meet me?

56:43.320 --> 56:45.160
Hey. Oh! Sorry.

56:45.200 --> 56:46.480
No, no. I'm sorry.

56:50.560 --> 56:53.000
I am so about Travis.

56:53.040 --> 56:56.360
He has surgery for two more hours.
There's nothing I can do.

56:56.400 --> 56:58.080
So I just feel really helpless.

56:58.120 --> 57:01.160
I'm happy that you called me.
We'll figure it out, OK?

57:01.200 --> 57:02.520
I can't think.

57:02.560 --> 57:05.320
I can't go home because John
showed up there unexpectedly,

57:05.360 --> 57:07.520
he showed up on my morning run,

57:07.560 --> 57:10.200
I think he's following me,
I don't know.

57:10.240 --> 57:12.520
Did you see him? No.

57:13.920 --> 57:17.880
Listen, I already called the
Murphy Police and the LAPD.

57:17.920 --> 57:20.720
I asked them to check the tyre
tracks at the scene of the accident

57:20.760 --> 57:22.640
to see if they can match them
with John's SUV.

57:22.680 --> 57:24.240
He's not getting away with this.

57:24.280 --> 57:25.440
Thank you.

57:26.960 --> 57:28.520
Is Travis going to be OK?

57:30.240 --> 57:31.400
I hope so.

57:33.640 --> 57:36.160
What do you think
Travis found out there?

57:38.120 --> 57:41.800
I think he found out
that John isn't Philip or John,

57:41.840 --> 57:44.840
but he's someone that works
at Davrow University.

57:47.560 --> 57:50.200
I don't care about that.
All I can think about is Travis.

57:50.240 --> 57:53.160
I just want him to be OK.
That's all I can think about.

57:53.200 --> 57:56.360
I want to make John pay
for what he did to you and Travis.

57:56.400 --> 57:58.160
He will not get away with it.

58:03.000 --> 58:04.840
Thank you for being here.

58:04.880 --> 58:07.760
You're the only one
that understands.

58:07.800 --> 58:11.840
Unfortunately, I do. Do you want
me to stay the night with you?

58:11.880 --> 58:15.360
Oh, no. That's sweet. I just want to
go back to the house alone.

58:15.400 --> 58:20.320
Wait for news of Travis. OK, well
call me if you need anything.

59:11.280 --> 59:13.400
KNOCKING

59:22.080 --> 59:24.800
Hello. Sorry! I didn't know
he still had visitors.

59:24.840 --> 59:27.080
Is he going to be OK?

59:27.120 --> 59:29.760
That man's a fighter.
I can tell these things.

59:29.800 --> 59:31.880
So he's going to pull
through then, right?

59:31.920 --> 59:34.560
I can't answer that,
but if anyone can, it's Travis.

59:35.800 --> 59:38.560
I'm so sorry this is going to be
upsetting but visiting hours

59:38.600 --> 59:39.840
are over in five minutes.

59:39.880 --> 59:43.520
Oh, no. I'm like family to him.
I was just going to sleep here.

59:43.560 --> 59:46.960
Typically I would let it slide, but
my boss is on the floor tonight.

59:47.000 --> 59:48.240
Please!

59:48.280 --> 59:50.720
I'm sorry, sweetheart.
Five minutes is all you've got.

59:55.760 --> 59:59.600
Hey. Can't stay,
but I'll be back tomorrow, OK?

1:00:51.000 --> 1:00:52.520
ALARM SOUNDS

1:00:52.560 --> 1:00:57.280
'Security system is armed.
Please enter passcode.'

1:00:57.320 --> 1:00:59.920
PHONE RINGS

1:01:01.400 --> 1:01:03.480
'This is Security.
Your house's alarm...'

1:01:03.520 --> 1:01:05.480
Someone's in my house.
Please come quick.

1:01:05.520 --> 1:01:08.000
'Stay on the phone.
We're sending help.'

1:01:08.040 --> 1:01:09.400
OK.

1:01:11.600 --> 1:01:13.520
ALARM STOPS AND PHONE GOES DEAD
Hello?

1:01:13.560 --> 1:01:15.320
Hello?

1:01:16.600 --> 1:01:17.960
Hello?

1:01:41.480 --> 1:01:42.640
Hello?

1:01:50.080 --> 1:01:51.760
Where are you?

1:01:53.720 --> 1:01:55.640
I'm not afraid of you!

1:02:59.040 --> 1:03:01.200
Oh, my God.

1:03:05.200 --> 1:03:06.560
Carrie?

1:03:09.960 --> 1:03:11.280
Carrie?

1:03:26.720 --> 1:03:29.240
Carrie, are you here?

1:03:44.360 --> 1:03:45.600
Carrie?

1:03:53.640 --> 1:03:54.960
Carrie?

1:04:10.000 --> 1:04:12.800
SHE GASPS
Oh!

1:04:56.160 --> 1:04:59.280
There are 42 John Andersons
in the LA area,

1:04:59.320 --> 1:05:01.120
and we don't know which one's yours.

1:05:01.160 --> 1:05:04.480
The social media accounts you
directed me to have been deleted.

1:05:05.960 --> 1:05:07.640
Did you go to his house?

1:05:07.680 --> 1:05:10.000
We sent units by the house.
No-one was there, of course,

1:05:10.040 --> 1:05:11.480
but we'll continue to check back.

1:05:11.520 --> 1:05:13.360
We did look at public records,

1:05:13.400 --> 1:05:16.280
and we found out that
this residence was purchased

1:05:16.320 --> 1:05:18.560
by a private trust four months ago.

1:05:18.600 --> 1:05:20.240
Fentiman Trust.

1:05:20.280 --> 1:05:21.480
Does that ring a bell?

1:05:22.800 --> 1:05:24.160
No.

1:05:24.200 --> 1:05:27.160
Well, we're looking into individuals
at the Trust now,

1:05:27.200 --> 1:05:29.680
but until then,
we have nothing to go on.

1:05:29.720 --> 1:05:34.080
I mean, there is no John Anderson
that matches your description.

1:05:34.120 --> 1:05:35.680
No evidence that he exists.

1:05:35.720 --> 1:05:38.600
What about Christian Wellesley?
We looked into Mr Wellesley.

1:05:38.640 --> 1:05:41.920
He is a prestigious professor
at Davrow University

1:05:41.960 --> 1:05:44.040
in the neuroscience department.

1:05:44.080 --> 1:05:46.880
He's got no criminal record and
he has a residence in Melford,

1:05:46.920 --> 1:05:49.800
California, where he
lives with his wife and child.

1:05:49.840 --> 1:05:51.000
What?

1:05:51.040 --> 1:05:52.080
What?

1:05:52.120 --> 1:05:55.920
I'm sorry. You just...
He has a wife and a kid? Yes.

1:05:58.000 --> 1:05:59.520
Oh, my God.

1:05:59.560 --> 1:06:01.240
What is it?

1:06:01.280 --> 1:06:05.080
Travis found out about John's family
and that's why he tried to kill him.

1:06:08.440 --> 1:06:11.160
He killed Carrie Avery.
He attacked me in my own home.

1:06:11.200 --> 1:06:12.480
Travis is in a coma.

1:06:12.520 --> 1:06:14.240
There's nothing that you can do?!

1:06:14.280 --> 1:06:17.280
Melford Police have promised
they will interview Mr Wellesley,

1:06:17.320 --> 1:06:19.760
his wife and his colleagues
at the University.

1:06:19.800 --> 1:06:23.280
Good. He might have a bandage
or a cast on his arm.

1:06:23.320 --> 1:06:25.240
I think I broke it
in our fight tonight.

1:06:25.280 --> 1:06:27.160
Good to know.
You can't move any faster?

1:06:27.200 --> 1:06:30.000
There's nothing you can do? I assure
you we're conducting a thorough

1:06:30.040 --> 1:06:32.720
investigation,
but until we find this guy,

1:06:32.760 --> 1:06:35.160
I'd suggest you get
a restraining order.

1:06:35.200 --> 1:06:36.680
Oh, really?!

1:06:36.720 --> 1:06:40.200
How is that possible? You said
John Anderson doesn't exist.

1:06:40.240 --> 1:06:41.880
But Christian Wellesley does exist.

1:06:41.920 --> 1:06:45.360
I can't arrest him now, but if he
breaks a restraining order, I can.

1:06:45.400 --> 1:06:48.560
So I have to be attacked in order
for you to do anything else.

1:06:48.600 --> 1:06:51.400
You get that restraining order,
we'll make sure Wellesley

1:06:51.440 --> 1:06:54.600
doesn't come within 1,000 feet of
you. I want to file that right now.

1:06:54.640 --> 1:06:56.320
It's a smart idea.

1:07:03.120 --> 1:07:04.560
So, this is it.

1:07:08.480 --> 1:07:10.720
Suspect should have a cast
on his right arm.

1:07:10.760 --> 1:07:13.640
It was broken when he assaulted
the victim in her home.

1:07:13.680 --> 1:07:15.160
Let's go.

1:07:35.400 --> 1:07:36.520
Professor Wellesley?

1:07:36.560 --> 1:07:38.520
Yes. How can I help you, officers?

1:07:38.560 --> 1:07:40.800
We just want to ask you
a few questions.

1:07:40.840 --> 1:07:42.480
Do you know Melissa Davis?

1:07:44.120 --> 1:07:45.240
No, I don't.

1:07:45.280 --> 1:07:47.280
Have you taken any trips lately?

1:07:48.600 --> 1:07:52.080
No. I just work full time
here at the university.

1:07:52.120 --> 1:07:56.280
Where were you on the night of the
28th? I believe here in Melford.

1:07:56.320 --> 1:07:58.440
I was probably my office
working on my book.

1:07:58.480 --> 1:08:00.640
If you speak with my wife,
I'm sure she'll tell you.

1:08:00.680 --> 1:08:03.320
Yeah, that'd be great. Can we?
Yeah, please.

1:08:16.760 --> 1:08:21.040
OK. I'll be back in a little bit
to check everything again.

1:08:23.480 --> 1:08:25.520
Hey, are you warm enough?

1:08:30.920 --> 1:08:33.880
White is not your colour,
by the way.

1:08:42.760 --> 1:08:44.320
I'm sorry.

1:08:46.320 --> 1:08:47.640
I'm sorry that...

1:08:49.640 --> 1:08:51.760
..I let you go for me.

1:08:54.080 --> 1:08:55.800
It's my fault.

1:09:09.240 --> 1:09:12.920
I need you, Travis.
I need you to pull through.

1:09:12.960 --> 1:09:15.200
Because I can't lose you.

1:09:18.600 --> 1:09:19.960
Please.

1:09:23.040 --> 1:09:25.720
I don't know what I'll do
if I lose you.

1:09:28.200 --> 1:09:29.560
Nurse!

1:09:29.600 --> 1:09:31.200
No, no, no. It's OK.

1:09:31.240 --> 1:09:32.520
Hey.

1:09:32.560 --> 1:09:34.880
Hey, you're awake.

1:09:34.920 --> 1:09:36.760
John...

1:09:36.800 --> 1:09:40.120
No. John, I know, I know.
I know about his other family.

1:09:40.160 --> 1:09:42.520
Listen to me. Carrie's dead.

1:09:42.560 --> 1:09:45.040
John killed her.

1:09:45.080 --> 1:09:48.040
And I have to tell you that
I'm sorry that I didn't listen

1:09:48.080 --> 1:09:49.520
to what you said about John

1:09:49.560 --> 1:09:52.160
and I need to tell you
how special you are to me.

1:09:52.200 --> 1:09:56.000
It's horrible when we realise
how important someone is to you,

1:09:56.040 --> 1:09:58.320
when you think that...

1:10:00.320 --> 1:10:03.440
Please don't go up there.
You have to promise me.

1:10:03.480 --> 1:10:06.280
Travis, I have to.

1:10:06.320 --> 1:10:07.720
OK?

1:10:08.880 --> 1:10:11.240
You've got to
promise me something though.

1:10:11.280 --> 1:10:14.960
Promise me that you're going
to hang in there till I get back

1:10:15.000 --> 1:10:16.840
because you're all I've got.

1:10:16.880 --> 1:10:18.120
OK.

1:10:21.640 --> 1:10:23.640
Because I can't live without you.

1:10:25.360 --> 1:10:28.560
I love you. Say that again.

1:10:29.800 --> 1:10:33.160
I love you. I love you.
I love you too.

1:10:33.200 --> 1:10:35.720
I'm going to be OK.

1:10:35.760 --> 1:10:37.120
I promise.

1:11:00.000 --> 1:11:03.480
Thank you for your help,
Mr Wellesley. Mm-hmm.

1:11:05.240 --> 1:11:09.320
Well, if I hear anything else, I'll
call you immediately. Thank you.

1:11:11.480 --> 1:11:13.440
His arm was fine.

1:11:15.000 --> 1:11:16.800
I liked the wallpaper.

1:12:17.560 --> 1:12:19.560
Hi.

1:12:19.600 --> 1:12:21.960
Oh, hi! Can I help you?

1:12:22.000 --> 1:12:23.840
Are you Mrs Wellesley?

1:12:23.880 --> 1:12:26.160
Yes. And you are?

1:12:26.200 --> 1:12:29.280
Oh, sorry. Melissa Davis.
I'm a friend of your husband's.

1:12:29.320 --> 1:12:32.040
Oh, well, I'm afraid
he's not home right now.

1:12:32.080 --> 1:12:34.240
Yeah, I know,
he's at the university.

1:12:34.280 --> 1:12:37.320
I was actually hoping that
I could speak with you alone.

1:12:37.360 --> 1:12:38.840
About what?

1:12:38.880 --> 1:12:40.280
About your husband.

1:12:40.320 --> 1:12:41.960
It's important.

1:12:42.000 --> 1:12:43.440
OK.

1:12:54.240 --> 1:12:55.600
How old?

1:12:55.640 --> 1:12:57.360
She's six months.

1:12:57.400 --> 1:12:58.440
Ah.

1:12:59.640 --> 1:13:02.320
It's beautiful house. Thank you.

1:13:02.360 --> 1:13:03.920
It was my husband's father's.

1:13:03.960 --> 1:13:07.200
So, how do you know my husband?

1:13:08.920 --> 1:13:12.520
I'm an interior designer from
Los Angeles, and John hired me.

1:13:12.560 --> 1:13:15.560
Oh, I think there must be
some kind of mistake.

1:13:15.600 --> 1:13:17.600
We don't own a home in Los Angeles.

1:13:17.640 --> 1:13:20.480
But the Fentiman Trust does,
and Christian is beneficiary.

1:13:20.520 --> 1:13:22.920
I don't quite understand.
No, why would you?

1:13:33.120 --> 1:13:37.000
Mrs Wellesley, this is going to be
really difficult to accept...

1:13:38.880 --> 1:13:43.480
..but your husband has been living
part-time in Los Angeles,

1:13:43.520 --> 1:13:45.800
under the alias John Anderson.

1:13:47.480 --> 1:13:50.840
When he goes out of town on
business trips, he comes to LA.

1:13:50.880 --> 1:13:54.320
Christian is one of the foremost
authorities on neurosurgery.

1:13:54.360 --> 1:13:56.920
He gives speaking engagements
all over the world,

1:13:56.960 --> 1:13:59.560
not just Los Angeles... He's not
going to speaking engagements.

1:13:59.600 --> 1:14:02.360
He's coming to Los Angeles
and he's spending time with me.

1:14:02.400 --> 1:14:04.800
Look, I didn't know that John...

1:14:06.080 --> 1:14:08.320
..that Christian was married.

1:14:08.360 --> 1:14:10.920
I would have never gotten
involved with him if...

1:14:15.000 --> 1:14:17.240
Why are you smiling at me?

1:14:19.760 --> 1:14:23.360
Because you're not the first
woman to come here.

1:14:25.960 --> 1:14:27.280
What do you mean?

1:14:27.320 --> 1:14:29.560
Well, sometimes they're students.

1:14:29.600 --> 1:14:33.920
Other times they hear Christian
speak at a conference.

1:14:33.960 --> 1:14:36.080
You see, Miss Davis,

1:14:36.120 --> 1:14:38.360
my husband is very charming.

1:14:38.400 --> 1:14:42.480
Women often mistake his friendliness
for flirtation.

1:14:42.520 --> 1:14:45.120
This is much more
than flirtation, Mrs Wellesley.

1:14:45.160 --> 1:14:46.840
We've been dating for four months.

1:14:51.680 --> 1:14:53.480
He told me you might come here.

1:14:53.520 --> 1:14:54.600
He did?

1:14:54.640 --> 1:14:57.920
He said that he met a woman
at an LA conference that had become,

1:14:57.960 --> 1:15:00.680
how did he put it?

1:15:02.000 --> 1:15:03.400
Obsessed.

1:15:03.440 --> 1:15:05.680
He said that he had to file
a restraining order...

1:15:05.720 --> 1:15:07.040
That is a lie.

1:15:07.080 --> 1:15:09.280
I filed a restraining order
against him.

1:15:09.320 --> 1:15:10.920
He attacked me in my home.

1:15:10.960 --> 1:15:12.640
He murdered my friend.

1:15:12.680 --> 1:15:15.360
I can assure you that I have
grown accustomed to women

1:15:15.400 --> 1:15:16.840
coming after my husband, but...

1:15:18.000 --> 1:15:19.960
..I haven't met one so delusional.

1:15:20.000 --> 1:15:23.000
Your husband
is a very dangerous man.

1:15:23.040 --> 1:15:25.400
I have been married to Christian
for 15 years.

1:15:25.440 --> 1:15:28.440
He loves me, and I love him.

1:15:30.800 --> 1:15:32.560
I think it's time for you to go now.

1:15:34.120 --> 1:15:35.520
Have a nice day.

1:15:40.600 --> 1:15:42.080
Thank you for the tea.

1:16:04.840 --> 1:16:07.400
You should not have come here!

1:16:07.440 --> 1:16:10.040
Just what did you think
you were going to accomplish?

1:16:10.080 --> 1:16:11.280
Christian!

1:16:12.640 --> 1:16:15.320
I'm so sorry. I didn't know
she was going to come here.

1:16:15.360 --> 1:16:17.080
I think you should call the police.

1:16:17.120 --> 1:16:19.200
There's laws against things
like this!

1:16:19.240 --> 1:16:20.880
He's trying to kill me!

1:16:20.920 --> 1:16:22.840
Listen to me. This woman is sick.

1:16:22.880 --> 1:16:23.880
Ahh!

1:16:26.200 --> 1:16:29.200
Christian, what are you doing with a
gun?! Oh, my God, you're bleeding.

1:16:29.240 --> 1:16:30.960
I'm going to call an ambulance. No.

1:16:31.000 --> 1:16:33.280
Do not call an ambulance!

1:16:49.360 --> 1:16:51.200
Melissa!

1:16:52.360 --> 1:16:53.840
Melissa!

1:19:02.640 --> 1:19:04.200
Put your gun down.

1:19:04.240 --> 1:19:07.000
I said drop the gun!

1:19:10.000 --> 1:19:12.480
Look, I'm not going to
tell you again!

1:19:17.160 --> 1:19:18.680
You're never going to hurt me.

1:19:18.720 --> 1:19:21.880
You're just like all the others.

1:19:23.160 --> 1:19:24.400
Weak.

1:19:25.760 --> 1:19:28.760
Oh! Oh, my God. Get away from him!

1:19:30.520 --> 1:19:32.440
Christian! Christian!

1:19:35.240 --> 1:19:37.560
Did you kill him?

1:19:37.600 --> 1:19:39.040
I don't know.

1:19:40.440 --> 1:19:42.480
Olivia.

1:19:42.520 --> 1:19:44.200
He's been lying to you.

1:19:44.240 --> 1:19:46.200
He's been hurting other women.

1:19:47.600 --> 1:19:49.080
He tried to kill me.

1:19:57.160 --> 1:19:58.880
You have to believe me.

1:20:00.720 --> 1:20:02.120
Go.

1:20:02.160 --> 1:20:04.560
Go get an ambulance.

1:20:14.520 --> 1:20:17.040
Put that in your book.

1:20:31.120 --> 1:20:34.200
Don't forget napkins
when you're setting the table.

1:20:34.240 --> 1:20:38.040
I'm pretty sure that was your job.
It was not! It was. It was your job!

1:20:40.840 --> 1:20:42.280
You look so much better.

1:20:42.320 --> 1:20:44.720
How bad did I look before?
Did you see Rocky?

1:20:44.760 --> 1:20:46.360
I did not look that bad!

1:20:46.400 --> 1:20:48.560
It was pretty bad.
Don't make me laugh.

1:20:48.600 --> 1:20:51.240
Oh, no laughing! No laughing
allowed at this table.

1:20:53.960 --> 1:20:56.920
You're in pain, but I'm just
really glad that you're here.

1:20:56.960 --> 1:20:59.480
I am. And I'm here to stay.

1:21:02.200 --> 1:21:04.160
Oh, God.

1:21:05.840 --> 1:21:09.000
I just wish I could have stopped
John... Stop it, stop it.

1:21:09.040 --> 1:21:11.280
You're one of the strongest,
bravest women I know.

1:21:11.320 --> 1:21:13.880
I don't know about that.
John's still alive.

1:21:13.920 --> 1:21:16.680
He's going to go away for
a really, really long time,

1:21:16.720 --> 1:21:18.680
especially now that his wife
agreed to testify.

1:21:18.720 --> 1:21:20.040
That won't bring Carrie back.

1:21:20.080 --> 1:21:23.680
He's not gonna hurt anyone ever
again, and that's because of you.

1:21:23.720 --> 1:21:25.560
You got him.

1:21:25.600 --> 1:21:28.280
And you're home now.

1:21:28.320 --> 1:21:31.120
It always feels like home
when you're here.

1:21:41.840 --> 1:21:44.160
Er, ahem! Hey!

1:21:44.200 --> 1:21:46.520
What happened at the hospital?!

1:21:46.560 --> 1:21:49.000
Hey, hey, we're about to eat!

1:21:49.040 --> 1:21:50.920
OK, well you guys are super cute,

1:21:50.960 --> 1:21:53.800
so I'm just going to take
some pictures.

1:21:53.840 --> 1:21:57.800
Just for the record, I knew this
was the right man all along.

1:21:57.840 --> 1:21:59.440
Look at you!

1:22:27.560 --> 1:22:31.280
