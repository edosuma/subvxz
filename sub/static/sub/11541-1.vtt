00:40.791 --> 00:42.792
  Sonderkommando: a German expression.

00:42.960 --> 00:45.920
  The term was used in concentration camps

00:46.088 --> 00:49.340
  for prisoners with special statuses,

00:49.508 --> 00:53.052
  who were also referred to as "the knowers of 
the secrets" (Geheimnisträger).

00:53.220 --> 00:57.306
  The members of the Sonderkommando are
separated from the rest of the camp,

00:57.474 --> 01:00.768
  working for a couple of months before
they would be killed as well.

01:47.548 --> 01:49.123
Let's go.

02:25.395 --> 02:26.562
Halt!

04:44.534 --> 04:47.703
We need people like you in the workshops.

04:49.706 --> 04:52.458
You will work and you'll be well paid.

04:53.251 --> 04:56.837
After taking a shower and 
having some soup, come to see me.

05:00.467 --> 05:02.718
We need nurses.

05:03.553 --> 05:06.555
We need artisans of all trades.

05:09.184 --> 05:11.185
Joiners, carpenters,

05:12.312 --> 05:14.105
masons, concrete workers,

05:15.607 --> 05:18.734
mechanics, locksmiths, electricians.

05:20.862 --> 05:23.572
When you're finished, come and see me.

05:26.868 --> 05:28.828
Put all clothing here.

05:29.538 --> 05:31.163
And all suitcases too.

05:31.748 --> 05:33.249
Undress.

05:33.834 --> 05:37.378
A little bit faster!
Remember your hook number.

05:38.880 --> 05:41.716
Hurry up, your soups are getting cold.

05:48.849 --> 05:50.266
Open the door.

06:23.858 --> 06:25.409
What is happening here?

06:40.358 --> 06:42.651
Thank you! Go ahead. Close the door.

06:44.613 --> 06:45.821
The door!

07:02.756 --> 07:04.090
You too, come.

07:39.751 --> 07:44.755
THE SON OF SAUL

07:51.388 --> 07:52.596
Faster.

08:05.443 --> 08:07.069
Come on, faster.

09:19.197 --> 09:20.643
Back to work!

09:20.894 --> 09:22.019
You!

09:23.104 --> 09:26.023
Check him! Put him here!

10:04.557 --> 10:07.231
He's still breathing.

10:08.191 --> 10:09.525
Get back to work!

10:59.369 --> 11:01.869
Good. Open him up.

11:08.168 --> 11:10.794
I've only seen something like this once.

11:10.962 --> 11:12.671
There was this girl...

11:14.299 --> 11:16.467
He wants an autopsy.

11:19.679 --> 11:21.180
Bring him to me.

11:27.900 --> 11:29.938
- Let me do it!
- What?

11:33.276 --> 11:35.194
What are you doing?

12:00.095 --> 12:01.345
Put him there.

12:05.308 --> 12:07.017
Put him down. Right now.

12:12.285 --> 12:15.085
Doctor, please ...

12:15.185 --> 12:16.568
  Are you a Hungarian?

12:17.445 --> 12:18.904
  I didn't know.

12:45.974 --> 12:47.766
  Don't do an autopsy on the boy!

12:52.939 --> 12:54.565
  Just leave him like this!

12:55.483 --> 12:56.442
  No.

12:58.611 --> 12:59.862
Get out.

13:04.868 --> 13:06.243
  A relative of yours?

13:10.665 --> 13:11.999
  Even if he is.

13:13.126 --> 13:14.835
  You have no need for him.

13:16.171 --> 13:17.963
  But your boss does?

13:20.049 --> 13:21.675
  Where did you come from?

13:23.052 --> 13:24.428
  Ungvár.

13:29.517 --> 13:31.602
  I am a prisoner, just like you.

13:33.563 --> 13:36.398
  I'll give you five minutes with him
in the evening.

13:40.987 --> 13:43.655
  But in the end, he will burn just like the others.

13:47.952 --> 13:49.536
  What's your name?

13:51.414 --> 13:52.915
  Auslander.

13:55.543 --> 13:56.835
  Saul.

14:01.299 --> 14:03.008
Burn each one of them!

14:13.186 --> 14:14.728
- From where?
- What?

14:14.896 --> 14:16.772
The last convoy! Was it from Hungary?

14:17.482 --> 14:19.149
Back to work!

14:33.414 --> 14:34.581
You!

14:34.958 --> 14:35.999
Hungarian?

14:36.167 --> 14:37.709
- Who?
- The transport.

14:37.877 --> 14:38.919
No.

14:39.754 --> 14:41.004
Perhaps.

14:41.381 --> 14:42.756
They came from another camp.

14:42.924 --> 14:43.924
You!

14:53.351 --> 14:56.019
Your boyfriend is asked to shut his mouth.

15:42.859 --> 15:44.318
Abraham!

16:20.271 --> 16:22.731
Bring me the gold.

16:22.899 --> 16:24.107
But...

16:24.859 --> 16:26.443
Bring me reports!

16:27.570 --> 16:28.987
Don't shit your pants!

16:30.865 --> 16:32.324
  I will help you.

17:01.729 --> 17:03.313
Get back to work!

17:12.990 --> 17:15.157
  Leave the food. Only money and jewellery

17:24.252 --> 17:25.544
  What are you looking at?

17:32.552 --> 17:36.263
Gold, jewels, valuables: into the box.

17:43.312 --> 17:47.315
Money, money ... Whatever you find.

18:04.417 --> 18:05.876
I told you, money and jewellery!!

18:23.144 --> 18:26.396
You want to put yourself in
their pockets, dirty pig?

19:25.623 --> 19:27.040
  Give it back!

19:28.960 --> 19:30.877
You and me, it's like forever.

19:31.879 --> 19:33.463
  Four months...

19:33.631 --> 19:35.215
We are like family!

19:37.093 --> 19:39.010
Go wash, you stink.

19:40.221 --> 19:41.388
Calm down.

19:52.650 --> 19:53.859
Rabbi ...

19:54.986 --> 19:56.736
Bury someone.

19:58.072 --> 20:00.031
Bury? The prayer is enough.

20:00.199 --> 20:02.576
I have the body. Help me!

20:02.869 --> 20:05.161
Get lost. You know the Kaddish?

20:05.496 --> 20:07.372
I'll say it for him. What's his name?

20:10.585 --> 20:12.502
There's nothing more we can do.

20:14.839 --> 20:16.256
That's not enough!

20:17.758 --> 20:19.217
You know as well!

20:22.597 --> 20:24.389
What are you doing in my Kommando?

20:24.557 --> 20:26.016
You know!

20:28.102 --> 20:29.769
- And you?
-  I just had some work!

20:29.937 --> 20:31.813
What's the matter?

20:31.981 --> 20:34.941
- They shouldn't be here.
- I sent them.

20:35.109 --> 20:38.028
- I don't want them. This is my Kommando.
- I am the Oberkapo!

20:38.195 --> 20:40.322
You're a dirty Jewish rat!

20:56.756 --> 21:00.550
- He thinks we're screwed.
- No, it's nothing.

21:05.473 --> 21:07.223
It's not much. And him?

21:07.558 --> 21:09.142
  I've got nothing.

21:17.360 --> 21:19.653
- Di you find me any papers?
- No.

21:20.529 --> 21:21.571
Come.

21:22.448 --> 21:23.406
Come on!

21:25.826 --> 21:26.868
Quick!

21:57.858 --> 21:59.526
  You must help me.

22:00.611 --> 22:02.487
  I need another rabbi.

22:03.906 --> 22:06.116
  Why do you need a rabbi?

22:06.283 --> 22:08.076
  How come Machaias is not good for you?

22:08.995 --> 22:11.204
  You won't be afraid any less with others either.

22:13.541 --> 22:14.749
  Rabbi?

22:18.170 --> 22:20.046
How about the Renegade?

22:31.726 --> 22:34.019
  Have you heard about the Epichaires? ???

22:34.979 --> 22:37.439
  A Greek. They say he used to be a rabbi.

22:38.232 --> 22:39.691
  In which Kommando?

22:39.859 --> 22:41.609
In Mietek's Kommando.

22:41.902 --> 22:43.570
The work is done.

22:45.781 --> 22:46.781
  Mietek?

22:46.949 --> 22:49.200
  That's right. That Polish scum.

22:52.747 --> 22:54.080
I know him.

22:54.457 --> 22:56.875
He has two scars on his face.

22:57.835 --> 22:59.502
  - What does he have on his face?
- Scars.

22:59.670 --> 23:01.463
Marked by God.

23:02.673 --> 23:04.215
Superstition!

23:04.383 --> 23:06.801
  - I must talk to him.
- Stop this!

23:14.101 --> 23:15.602
Grab those things!

24:07.488 --> 24:08.655
He is with us.

24:09.115 --> 24:12.158
In the Kanada, there is a girl. She has a package.

24:12.326 --> 24:13.993
Can you send someone for it?

24:14.703 --> 24:16.121
In two days.

24:16.455 --> 24:17.580
In two days?

24:17.748 --> 24:19.958
They already put us on the list.

24:20.126 --> 24:21.459
Who told you?

24:21.627 --> 24:23.586
My manin the office.

24:26.632 --> 24:28.550
We took the pictures first.

24:30.177 --> 24:31.553
What photos, Elijah?

24:31.720 --> 24:34.722
There was no time for that.
We will go there.

24:35.057 --> 24:37.934
You think you can make everything
explode?

24:38.102 --> 24:41.187
You think that your photos
will reach the liberators?

24:44.191 --> 24:45.191
Find me a locksmith.

24:45.359 --> 24:46.693
Me, I can.

24:47.111 --> 24:48.695
  - What is it you can do?
- What he wants.

24:48.863 --> 24:50.029
What is he saying?

24:50.197 --> 24:51.531
  Tell him.

24:52.741 --> 24:55.493
  - You don't even know what we're 
talking about. - I must get out of here.

24:55.661 --> 24:56.911
  He wants a locksmith, not you!

24:57.079 --> 24:58.955
- You speak Yiddish? - Barely.

24:59.123 --> 25:01.374
  Tell him that I was a watchmaker.

25:01.542 --> 25:03.459
  I can fix anything.

25:03.627 --> 25:07.255
He said he was a watchmaker,
he can do the work of a locksmith.

25:08.424 --> 25:09.507
A locksmith?

25:13.596 --> 25:14.929
Come with me.

25:18.100 --> 25:20.768
  - If you go out, you're all alone.
- Come.

25:38.204 --> 25:39.412
Katz?

26:08.484 --> 26:09.901
These two are with me.

26:10.069 --> 26:11.402
Go.

26:20.496 --> 26:21.996
They are with me.

27:08.961 --> 27:11.045
If a Kapo shows up.

27:16.969 --> 27:19.762
- Mietek ... Kommando? - What?

27:19.930 --> 27:21.556
Why is he here?

27:21.724 --> 27:23.182
He stands guard.

27:23.350 --> 27:24.517
Biederman!

27:26.812 --> 27:27.895
Wait here.

27:36.530 --> 27:38.573
- Who is it?
- The farm!

27:51.253 --> 27:53.129
Fucking Mietek!

27:54.131 --> 27:57.008
Fix the door, but watch out!

27:57.176 --> 27:59.344
You understand? Keep your eyes open!

28:52.314 --> 28:53.356
You!

28:53.899 --> 28:55.149
Finished?

28:55.734 --> 28:56.818
There's too much smoke!

28:56.985 --> 28:57.777
You!

29:01.615 --> 29:03.324
There's too much smoke!

29:13.919 --> 29:15.128
Stand aside!

29:37.359 --> 29:38.192
Go outside!

29:38.861 --> 29:39.944
- What?
- Go outside.

29:42.531 --> 29:43.906
Where are you going?

29:53.083 --> 29:54.292
Halt!

29:54.793 --> 29:56.043
Stop.

29:58.672 --> 30:00.131
Come here!

30:00.340 --> 30:01.507
Locksmith!

30:15.063 --> 30:16.564
Finish it!

30:28.452 --> 30:29.994
Rally!

31:14.581 --> 31:16.040
Where are you going?

31:28.178 --> 31:29.595
Greek rabbi?

33:10.197 --> 33:12.281
Careful not to drop the ashes!

33:25.337 --> 33:27.046
You! Are you the Renegade?

33:30.258 --> 33:31.676
I need you

33:32.344 --> 33:33.594
for the dead.

33:36.932 --> 33:38.224
You understand?

33:39.142 --> 33:41.644
All ashes into the water!

33:51.863 --> 33:53.531
A dead child!

34:06.920 --> 34:08.670
You are a rabbi!

34:12.967 --> 34:15.052
Mietek knows you're a rabbi.

34:18.514 --> 34:21.225
Praised are You,

34:21.393 --> 34:22.101
Adonai ...

34:56.469 --> 34:58.095
Do not pull over!

35:06.480 --> 35:08.481
Get them out of there.

35:49.940 --> 35:51.524
Forgive me.

35:58.657 --> 36:01.116
Who can explain me what happened?

36:03.119 --> 36:04.245
Can you?

36:16.216 --> 36:17.883
My shovel ...

36:18.510 --> 36:21.595
These pigs don't speak
German, Oberscharführer.

36:29.354 --> 36:31.689
Can anyone translate from ...

36:32.190 --> 36:33.983
...which language?

36:34.818 --> 36:35.734
Hungarian.

36:35.902 --> 36:36.944
Hungarian!

36:37.946 --> 36:39.280
Gentlemen?

36:42.325 --> 36:43.909
  What happened?

36:44.077 --> 36:46.078
  The shovel fell into the water.

36:46.413 --> 36:47.913
  He was trying to recover it.

36:51.668 --> 36:54.545
So, he was rescued ... and the shovel?

36:55.422 --> 36:57.172
Yes, Oberscharführer!

36:58.049 --> 37:00.551
You see,  he DOES speak German.

37:12.981 --> 37:15.608
Hungarian is a very beautiful language.

37:19.362 --> 37:21.196
The other stays here.

37:27.954 --> 37:29.788
Bring this pig to work!

37:33.460 --> 37:34.668
  Come on! Faster!

37:51.394 --> 37:53.312
Who are you, you scum?

37:55.774 --> 37:57.232
In my shoe ...

38:17.587 --> 38:19.338
Where did you come from?

38:21.216 --> 38:22.675
Biederman's Kommando.

38:22.842 --> 38:25.260
I'll come and see you soon.

38:28.723 --> 38:30.265
At work!

38:56.584 --> 38:59.420
This one, he belongs to me. I'm taking him.

39:12.892 --> 39:14.018
Call!

39:18.356 --> 39:20.149
  What happened?

39:23.111 --> 39:24.987
  You found the Greek.

39:26.197 --> 39:27.865
In ranks!

39:33.288 --> 39:34.371
Hats!

40:32.472 --> 40:33.972
  What are you doing?

40:35.517 --> 40:36.809
  I got something to do.

40:36.976 --> 40:38.143
  I come with you.

40:38.311 --> 40:39.478
  No need for that.

41:46.004 --> 41:50.132
What is the reason for your visit, please?

41:52.719 --> 41:53.886
Cleaning.

41:58.099 --> 41:59.308
Cleaning?

42:01.686 --> 42:02.978
Cleaning.

42:18.953 --> 42:22.915
A small dance shtetl, like in the old days!

42:44.729 --> 42:45.771
Outside!

42:57.784 --> 42:59.076
The rooms...

42:59.494 --> 43:01.495
The autopsy room ...

43:01.829 --> 43:02.829
Where are they?

43:02.997 --> 43:04.831
You're from the day shift.

43:04.999 --> 43:06.375
Get out!

43:07.293 --> 43:08.543
  The doctor promised!

43:08.711 --> 43:09.711
What?

43:45.415 --> 43:47.874
You want to go up in smoke?

45:45.750 --> 45:47.828
Rate gold.

45:47.995 --> 45:50.080
Come on, give.

46:05.138 --> 46:07.848
Praised are You, O Lord,
King of the universe,

46:08.015 --> 46:10.308
who make spring the bread
from the earth ...

46:11.144 --> 46:14.354
The Angel of Death hears
your prayers, Rabbi!

46:24.907 --> 46:26.950
You. Goldtone.

46:27.118 --> 46:28.452
I have nothing.

46:29.245 --> 46:32.831
You must have something, in
your mattress or in your socks.

46:34.375 --> 46:35.333
Abraham!

46:41.215 --> 46:42.591
  Get lost.

46:44.635 --> 46:46.303
  What were you doing down there?

46:49.807 --> 46:50.724
Give it to me.

46:51.184 --> 46:52.517
I said, give it to me.

46:56.606 --> 46:58.023
I'm taking it.

47:00.318 --> 47:01.568
  Get lost.

47:02.320 --> 47:03.570
We need them.

47:03.738 --> 47:05.530
We can not wait.

47:05.698 --> 47:08.200
We must retrieve the package from Ella.

47:12.246 --> 47:14.289
Will that be enough for the guards?

47:15.208 --> 47:16.166
Yes.

47:17.710 --> 47:19.377
  What is this butcher looking for here?

47:28.679 --> 47:29.804
  The boy!

47:31.390 --> 47:32.807
  Where is the boy?

47:33.309 --> 47:34.601
  I got the boy.

47:38.147 --> 47:40.565
  I had to hide him from the 
other doctors.

47:45.613 --> 47:47.614
  Can't you swap him?

47:48.407 --> 47:49.449
  Instead of somebody else?

47:49.617 --> 47:50.575
  No.

47:53.538 --> 47:56.289
  I have to do an autopsy. And 
make documentations about it.

47:57.250 --> 47:58.250
  Come.

48:20.731 --> 48:22.232
  What's your name?

48:22.400 --> 48:23.733
  Auslander.

48:24.777 --> 48:26.820
  I brought him back. He's inside.

48:28.698 --> 48:29.864
  I'll be back soon.

50:49.630 --> 50:51.256
What is it?

50:53.342 --> 50:54.801
You brought it here.

50:56.262 --> 50:58.388
You're playing with our lives.

51:00.433 --> 51:04.811
I can show the Germans where you
buried your notes about the camp!

52:22.765 --> 52:26.351
  We get the weapons tonight.
Be ready for tomorrow morning.

52:27.853 --> 52:29.103
  In the morning?

52:30.356 --> 52:32.232
  Yes. That's the plan.
In the morning.

52:40.783 --> 52:42.534
  I must find a rabbi.

52:46.664 --> 52:48.873
  I'll get you a rabbi after this.

52:51.335 --> 52:53.044
  I'll need you.

53:04.598 --> 53:07.183
  I wasn't so important for you 
until now.

53:12.356 --> 53:13.898
  Neither you are now.

53:17.778 --> 53:19.237
  I must eat.

53:41.552 --> 53:45.471
It was not just her body, it
was the way she was looking at me.

53:46.348 --> 53:50.351
I had to talk to her. It was breathtaking.

53:50.519 --> 53:53.563
Then she asked for it!

53:54.315 --> 53:56.232
  It would be better not to 
understand a single thing.

53:56.400 --> 53:59.068
  You used to talk about women 
before too.

54:00.237 --> 54:01.905
  I do not remember anymore.

54:18.881 --> 54:19.839
Come.

54:26.889 --> 54:30.516
We saw nothing from the
smoke, and he hid the camera.

54:41.528 --> 54:43.237
You know how to use a gun?

54:44.156 --> 54:45.615
Not really.

54:50.704 --> 54:52.080
I will show you.

54:52.247 --> 54:53.998
He doesn't know how to fight.

54:54.792 --> 54:57.669
He saved us today. Stop pampering him.

55:07.638 --> 55:09.097
Trucks.

55:09.264 --> 55:10.348
Abraham!

55:14.311 --> 55:15.603
A transport.

55:17.064 --> 55:18.147
Was it expected?

55:18.315 --> 55:19.899
They didn't tell me about it.

55:39.712 --> 55:40.878
Kapos!

55:43.549 --> 55:44.632
All Kapos!

55:46.885 --> 55:48.553
You, come with me.

55:54.852 --> 55:56.477
You're with me now.

55:59.106 --> 56:01.607
Hurry up, the coffee will get cold.

56:02.985 --> 56:04.360
Indoor disinfection!

56:04.528 --> 56:06.029
Come.

56:07.448 --> 56:09.615
Rally!

56:22.296 --> 56:23.629
Stay here.

56:26.842 --> 56:28.092
Hats!

56:39.688 --> 56:41.064
Oberscharführer!

56:42.107 --> 56:45.443
Bring the day shift reinforcements
and put them to work.

56:45.611 --> 56:47.028
Yes, Oberscharführer.

56:48.447 --> 56:51.074
After that, we will see how much
is left to be processed.

56:51.241 --> 56:52.241
Yes, Oberscharführer.

56:52.409 --> 56:53.785
You, you come as well.

56:55.871 --> 56:56.954
I said, come!

57:14.098 --> 57:15.348
Clean up!

57:23.023 --> 57:24.107
The table!

57:47.464 --> 57:48.798
Oberscharführer!

57:49.550 --> 57:50.550
So?

57:51.051 --> 57:53.136
How much is left to deal with?

57:54.555 --> 57:57.431
- One thousand, Oberscharführer.
- One thousand?

58:02.146 --> 58:03.437
One thousand...

58:03.605 --> 58:06.566
We expect three times more tonight.

58:06.942 --> 58:09.652
So let's do it like this:

58:10.195 --> 58:12.905
we must finish by dawn.

58:13.240 --> 58:16.659
At each passage, 2 men, 1 woman 1 child.

58:16.827 --> 58:19.704
Clean the ashes every second round,
and ventilate the air every 12 minutes.

58:19.872 --> 58:21.873
You are responsible. Understood?

58:22.040 --> 58:23.166
Yes, Oberscharführer.

58:23.333 --> 58:26.419
When you finish, cleaning and disinfection

58:26.587 --> 58:29.130
for the next transport. Dismissed.

58:30.382 --> 58:31.716
Oberkapo!

58:32.009 --> 58:33.676
Yes, Oberscharführer?

58:34.887 --> 58:37.263
I need a list of 70
names.

58:37.639 --> 58:39.932
Of men you don't need anymore.

58:41.101 --> 58:42.310
Begin.

58:42.895 --> 58:43.811
Yes, Sir.

58:59.745 --> 59:00.828
Hey, you!

59:05.918 --> 59:08.753
Go and bring me Schlojme.

59:10.088 --> 59:11.088
Yes, Sir.

59:23.101 --> 59:24.936
The Oberscharführer calling you.

59:31.568 --> 59:32.818
Hey you!

59:33.487 --> 59:35.404
You stay here.

01:00:19.324 --> 01:00:22.743
Get moving or all of you will be cremated!

01:00:23.120 --> 01:00:25.329
Bunch of crap!

01:00:25.622 --> 01:00:27.206
This one comes with me.

01:00:27.374 --> 01:00:29.250
Jump into the burning furnace!

01:00:40.804 --> 01:00:43.347
This cold water is not potable.

01:00:43.515 --> 01:00:46.517
After the shower, you will have some tea.

01:00:52.107 --> 01:00:53.149
Abraham!

01:00:56.778 --> 01:00:59.780
You were right. It's our turn.

01:01:00.532 --> 01:01:02.950
He wants 70
names tomorrow.

01:01:11.209 --> 01:01:13.836
- Who will pick up the package?
- Me.

01:01:14.254 --> 01:01:15.921
I come as well. Ella knows me.

01:01:16.089 --> 01:01:18.758
No. You must stay here.

01:01:20.093 --> 01:01:22.136
Take Saul then. She knows him.

01:01:22.512 --> 01:01:24.055
I don't know her.

01:01:24.222 --> 01:01:25.431
  Of course, you do.

01:01:26.600 --> 01:01:27.975
  I'm not going!

01:01:28.143 --> 01:01:29.143
Saul!

01:01:31.396 --> 01:01:33.064
  You WILL go, understand?

01:01:35.567 --> 01:01:36.942
  He goes with you.

01:01:37.361 --> 01:01:38.694
What is happening?

01:01:38.862 --> 01:01:40.029
Nothing.

01:01:40.322 --> 01:01:42.073
They both go with you.

01:01:46.953 --> 01:01:48.162
Forward!

01:01:58.423 --> 01:01:59.882
Oberkapo!

01:02:00.050 --> 01:02:01.008
Halt!

01:02:06.765 --> 01:02:08.224
Yes, Oberscharführer?

01:02:08.433 --> 01:02:10.893
What are you doing? We need you here!

01:02:11.061 --> 01:02:13.896
My men can no longer work.

01:02:14.064 --> 01:02:17.400
There are clothes piled up to the ceiling.

01:02:17.567 --> 01:02:20.611
We must put them to the warehouse.

01:02:21.279 --> 01:02:23.447
You stay here. The others will take care of it.

01:02:23.824 --> 01:02:25.366
Yes, Oberscharführer!

01:02:27.411 --> 01:02:28.577
Forward!

01:04:21.191 --> 01:04:22.858
The name of the girl?

01:04:23.026 --> 01:04:24.735
Fried, Ella.

01:04:27.030 --> 01:04:28.072
Fried!

01:05:14.619 --> 01:05:15.828
Keep your hands off.

01:06:00.707 --> 01:06:01.790
Saul!

01:06:13.887 --> 01:06:16.263
You're fast, you.

01:06:33.239 --> 01:06:34.365
  You got it?

01:06:34.532 --> 01:06:35.658
  Yes.

01:06:51.257 --> 01:06:53.842
  - Where are they going?
- To the pits.

01:06:55.553 --> 01:06:57.388
  The furnaces can't take no more.

01:07:23.456 --> 01:07:24.707
  Where are you going?

01:07:37.971 --> 01:07:39.096
  Where are you going?

01:07:39.514 --> 01:07:40.723
  Let me go!

01:07:42.726 --> 01:07:44.143
  Are you are rabbi?

01:08:04.748 --> 01:08:05.497
You...

01:08:05.665 --> 01:08:07.541
You know a rabbi?

01:08:26.685 --> 01:08:28.187
You, Rabbi?

01:08:37.988 --> 01:08:38.988
Rabbi?

01:08:46.163 --> 01:08:48.415
There, a rabbi!

01:08:59.469 --> 01:09:00.844
Rabbi!

01:09:06.600 --> 01:09:07.725
Come.

01:09:10.104 --> 01:09:11.188
Undress!

01:09:11.356 --> 01:09:12.523
Faster!

01:09:55.900 --> 01:09:56.859
You're here as well?

01:09:57.026 --> 01:09:59.278
A strong man for the Sonderkommando.

01:09:59.445 --> 01:10:01.488
You already want to replace yourself?

01:10:02.365 --> 01:10:05.617
Tell him! A strong man for the Sonderkommando.

01:10:05.910 --> 01:10:07.202
You lost your head?

01:10:07.871 --> 01:10:08.871
What?

01:10:13.376 --> 01:10:14.543
They'll kill you!

01:10:52.248 --> 01:10:53.332
Rabbi?

01:11:03.051 --> 01:11:05.636
See, Jews, that's how it goes.

01:11:05.803 --> 01:11:07.262
Take that one.

01:11:07.764 --> 01:11:09.681
What are you doing?

01:11:11.768 --> 01:11:12.976
Sonderkommando!

01:11:18.524 --> 01:11:21.193
  Don't shot  him! He  is Sonderkommando.

01:11:24.364 --> 01:11:25.572
  I too am Sonderkommando.

01:11:25.740 --> 01:11:27.366
Shut up, Jew!

01:11:48.471 --> 01:11:50.639
You're a Kommando, you dirty piece of shit!

01:11:51.224 --> 01:11:54.101
7005.

01:11:54.477 --> 01:11:55.686
Sonderkommando.

01:11:55.853 --> 01:11:57.854
He is from the Sonderkommando.

01:11:59.941 --> 01:12:01.692
He is from the Sonderkommando.

01:12:07.615 --> 01:12:09.992
This time, it will cost you two bracelets!

01:12:17.875 --> 01:12:19.001
Come on!

01:12:28.970 --> 01:12:30.429
Oberkapo!

01:13:19.228 --> 01:13:21.730
  You're gonna help me to give a 
burial to my son.

01:13:57.725 --> 01:13:59.101
Sixty seven.

01:13:59.602 --> 01:14:00.936
Sixty seven?

01:14:02.063 --> 01:14:04.898
What does that mean, 
you, bunch of motherfuckers?

01:14:11.239 --> 01:14:12.656
Who's that one?

01:14:13.866 --> 01:14:16.034
He is another one from the crematorium.

01:14:16.661 --> 01:14:18.120
Biederman is gone.

01:14:18.454 --> 01:14:19.746
Fuck.

01:14:20.373 --> 01:14:22.999
Kapo, how come we don't have the 
right amount?

01:14:24.001 --> 01:14:27.754
Oberscharführer, we lost some men in the fire.

01:14:28.089 --> 01:14:29.840
We'll see to that.

01:14:33.177 --> 01:14:34.261
Attention...

01:14:34.637 --> 01:14:35.428
March!

01:15:42.496 --> 01:15:45.040
Why did you bring here this one?

01:15:47.710 --> 01:15:48.877
He is a rabbi.

01:15:50.588 --> 01:15:52.047
For the dead.

01:16:11.234 --> 01:16:13.610
We take care of our own dead.

01:16:13.778 --> 01:16:15.654
People come to see me for that.

01:16:17.198 --> 01:16:18.740
I did come to see you!

01:16:18.908 --> 01:16:21.076
And I did say the Kaddish.

01:16:40.304 --> 01:16:43.515
This one a rabbi? He's just a bearded thief!

01:16:56.529 --> 01:16:57.821
That's the child.

01:16:59.156 --> 01:17:00.824
I hid him.

01:17:03.494 --> 01:17:05.704
  You'll tell me what to do.

01:18:13.189 --> 01:18:14.356
Saul!

01:18:23.199 --> 01:18:25.283
  Where have you been all night?

01:18:26.327 --> 01:18:27.994
  I was taken to the pits.

01:18:28.162 --> 01:18:29.454
  And the package?

01:18:31.040 --> 01:18:32.916
  The package from the women!

01:18:35.711 --> 01:18:39.130
  We need gunpowder for the explosion...

01:18:39.799 --> 01:18:41.132
  It fell out.

01:18:48.849 --> 01:18:50.392
  Is it him you found?

01:18:51.143 --> 01:18:52.602
  He will help us tomorrow.

01:18:52.770 --> 01:18:55.397
  Are you choosing a rabbi for yourself
from among the dead?

01:19:30.850 --> 01:19:32.225
The packet?

01:19:36.564 --> 01:19:37.981
He lost it.

01:19:41.652 --> 01:19:43.778
Jewish piece of shit!

01:19:46.615 --> 01:19:47.907
Son of a bitch.

01:20:00.713 --> 01:20:02.172
  Who is this?

01:20:08.137 --> 01:20:09.512
  My son.

01:20:10.806 --> 01:20:12.599
  You've got no son.

01:20:18.189 --> 01:20:19.439
  But I do.

01:20:22.193 --> 01:20:23.443
  I must bury him.

01:20:23.611 --> 01:20:25.653
  You don't need a rabbi for that.

01:20:27.781 --> 01:20:29.991
  He'll do what he must.

01:20:32.870 --> 01:20:36.164
  He stays there. And you get 
rid of the corpse.

01:21:03.400 --> 01:21:04.692
Rabbi!

01:22:36.910 --> 01:22:38.286
  Keep digging!

01:22:49.757 --> 01:22:50.673
What is that?

01:22:52.009 --> 01:22:53.301
It doesn't belong here.

01:22:53.510 --> 01:22:54.844
  I don't understand.

01:22:55.429 --> 01:22:56.888
What are you saying?

01:23:00.851 --> 01:23:02.268
This is my place.

01:23:13.697 --> 01:23:14.864
Get lost!

01:23:16.408 --> 01:23:17.867
Get lost, I'm telling you!

01:23:27.670 --> 01:23:29.587
Come! Quick!

01:24:15.759 --> 01:24:18.553
- Did he make his list?
- How many men?

01:24:23.392 --> 01:24:26.978
We can't wait any longer.

01:24:27.146 --> 01:24:29.689
The crema 2 doesn't
lift a finger.

01:24:52.337 --> 01:24:53.963
And now this.

01:24:54.339 --> 01:24:56.048
So Rabbi? This is Shabbat.

01:24:56.216 --> 01:24:57.759
You don't even know about it?

01:24:57.926 --> 01:25:00.928
  - Leave him alone.
- What do you want?

01:25:03.307 --> 01:25:06.851
  If he really  is a rabbi, he
should conduct the ceremony.

01:25:08.812 --> 01:25:12.815
- We will die because of you two.
- We are already dead.

01:25:28.874 --> 01:25:31.334
  I must  take care of my son.

01:25:36.131 --> 01:25:38.174
  He is not from my wife.

01:25:39.343 --> 01:25:41.803
  When did you see him for the last time?

01:25:47.726 --> 01:25:49.185
  You've got no son.

01:26:07.746 --> 01:26:09.455
You!

01:26:09.623 --> 01:26:10.998
Outside!

01:27:12.311 --> 01:27:13.936
  Find me a boy.

01:27:14.104 --> 01:27:16.355
  Same age, same hair.

01:27:25.824 --> 01:27:28.993
  You have forsaken the living for the dead.

01:27:34.207 --> 01:27:35.499
Attention!

01:27:36.919 --> 01:27:40.212
Into the changing room!

01:28:16.208 --> 01:28:18.834
At work!

01:28:19.211 --> 01:28:22.046
Collect the clothes!

01:28:27.636 --> 01:28:30.638
- It was another Kommando!
- The guards burned them.

01:28:35.435 --> 01:28:38.604
It was Biederman's!

01:29:05.132 --> 01:29:06.340
Rabbi!

01:29:41.543 --> 01:29:43.711
Come here, you bastard!

01:29:44.880 --> 01:29:46.797
Hurry up. You're going to fight.

01:29:50.343 --> 01:29:51.886
Move, you son of a bitch!

01:30:20.749 --> 01:30:23.292
I brought him here, from now on,
you help him.

01:30:28.882 --> 01:30:30.382
  Let me go.

01:31:20.100 --> 01:31:21.308
You!

01:32:43.350 --> 01:32:44.475
Rabbi!

01:35:03.531 --> 01:35:04.823
Say the Kaddish.

01:35:06.034 --> 01:35:08.160
Please. The Kaddish!

01:35:14.751 --> 01:35:16.418
Magnified and sanctified ...

01:35:16.878 --> 01:35:17.878
is...

01:35:18.338 --> 01:35:19.505
be the...

01:35:57.961 --> 01:36:00.129
Don't waste the time. Keep on!

01:40:06.918 --> 01:40:09.878
Only five minutes. We must continue.

01:40:12.757 --> 01:40:15.217
Two more kilometers through the woods.

01:40:16.219 --> 01:40:18.220
We should find members

01:40:18.721 --> 01:40:20.472
of the Home Army.

01:40:20.765 --> 01:40:22.557
They will give us weapons.

01:40:22.725 --> 01:40:26.561
We will fight. The Soviets
are almost in Krakow.

01:40:26.729 --> 01:40:28.897
Otherwise, we will go to Pszczyna.

01:40:41.786 --> 01:40:44.162
They have weapons. And food.

01:40:46.791 --> 01:40:48.500
How are you going to find them?

01:40:49.460 --> 01:40:53.213
We should jst hide and wait instead.

01:40:53.548 --> 01:40:54.506
No.

01:40:54.716 --> 01:40:58.176
We must find supporters and fight.
