03:38.551 --> 03:40.075
What are you talking about?

03:40.153 --> 03:42.747
Alan, don't get so uptight!

03:42.822 --> 03:45.188
You're telling me
you don't want to do this anymore.

03:45.258 --> 03:48.318
-That's not what I'm saying.
-Then what are you saying?

03:50.597 --> 03:51.689
Nice.

03:58.137 --> 04:02.130
What is it
with this morbid fixation of yours?

04:02.508 --> 04:04.066
You've got talent, Alan.

04:04.143 --> 04:08.739
I hate to see you squander it with
these adolescent monster movie images.

04:11.050 --> 04:13.518
Why this obsession with death?

04:14.153 --> 04:16.178
Everybody does life.

04:16.589 --> 04:20.149
Maybe you haven't noticed,
my little deadly nightshade...

04:20.560 --> 04:24.291
but it's a brand new age,
time to celebrate life...

04:24.430 --> 04:27.160
the love and the beauty
of the world around us.

04:27.233 --> 04:29.667
So why don't you draw what you see?

04:30.370 --> 04:31.462
I do.

04:32.438 --> 04:34.338
Yeah, more is the pity.

04:35.375 --> 04:37.775
Life is beautiful, Alan.

04:38.378 --> 04:41.472
This gruesome stuff isn't going
to get you anywhere.

04:41.547 --> 04:43.913
That's what my grandmother says.

04:46.119 --> 04:49.418
And a happy Hallow's Eve to you, my friend.

05:00.033 --> 05:03.833
Tricky Dick, your war is sick!

05:04.437 --> 05:06.428
Hell, no, we won't go!

05:15.114 --> 05:18.140
I can't believe you're breaking up with me
on my birthday.

05:18.217 --> 05:20.447
I'm not breaking up with you.

05:20.520 --> 05:24.980
God, you're being
so <i>Leave it to Beaver</i> about this.

05:25.058 --> 05:28.516
I'm sorry, Jessica, but I love you.
I thought you loved me.

05:28.628 --> 05:29.720
I do.

05:30.963 --> 05:32.555
I love everyone.

05:32.865 --> 05:35.390
-You want to.
-No such luck.

05:37.337 --> 05:40.431
Quit playing the Prince of Darkness
and kiss me.

05:40.807 --> 05:43.105
I can't. Not now.

05:44.944 --> 05:46.434
Suit yourself.

05:56.022 --> 05:57.546
Happy birthday.

05:58.324 --> 06:01.487
Yeah. Happy birthday to me.

06:49.108 --> 06:51.008
Happy fucking birthday.

07:00.286 --> 07:01.776
Fuck you, too!

08:47.193 --> 08:48.785
Good idea, Alan.

08:49.762 --> 08:52.595
You know, they don't appreciate you.

08:54.433 --> 08:57.095
Show them how important you are.

08:58.738 --> 09:00.365
Come on, Alan...

09:01.407 --> 09:04.001
you know it's beautiful over here.

09:05.678 --> 09:09.341
Just grit your teeth and cut!

09:13.686 --> 09:15.017
That's it.

09:16.188 --> 09:17.780
Show them, Alan.

09:19.525 --> 09:20.685
Do it!

09:22.194 --> 09:23.252
Cut!

09:41.781 --> 09:43.248
Surprise!

09:44.016 --> 09:45.540
Happy birthday!

09:49.221 --> 09:51.951
Why don't you guys give us some privacy?

09:56.829 --> 09:58.558
What are you doing?

10:10.209 --> 10:13.201
<i>-Are you okay?</i>
<i>-I'm fine.</i>

10:15.314 --> 10:18.374
<i>I am so sorry, Alan.</i>

10:21.587 --> 10:23.782
<i>You know how much I love you.</i>

10:30.229 --> 10:31.321
Damn!

10:31.831 --> 10:34.800
I guess lunch is gonna have to wait
until round two.

10:38.871 --> 10:41.465
That was a stupid fucking thing to do.

10:42.375 --> 10:45.276
Jesus, Alan, I was only kidding.

10:46.646 --> 10:49.547
I was trying to set you up
for your surprise party.

10:51.017 --> 10:53.281
Guess I surprised you instead.

10:54.587 --> 10:55.815
No shit.

10:59.091 --> 11:02.891
Suicide is a very selfish act, you know.

11:03.696 --> 11:06.995
Shit, one more life or death
seems pretty insignificant...

11:07.066 --> 11:09.432
in the greater planetary scheme of things.

11:09.502 --> 11:11.766
It makes a big difference to me.

11:12.672 --> 11:14.833
Death isn't glamorous, Alan.

11:16.075 --> 11:19.738
I guess I don't really know you.

11:20.713 --> 11:23.876
You, and about four billion other people
on the planet.

11:23.949 --> 11:27.112
Don't give me
that misunderstood artist bullshit.

11:27.687 --> 11:30.747
We all have problems. We deal with them.

11:32.258 --> 11:34.283
You know, you are whining.

11:35.461 --> 11:38.760
You're being kind of a creep,
to tell you the truth.

11:40.766 --> 11:42.131
I'm sorry.

11:43.002 --> 11:46.062
I'm just in my "poor me" stage.

11:47.139 --> 11:48.868
Call me an asshole.

11:48.974 --> 11:50.805
Are you ever going to pull...

11:50.876 --> 11:54.243
such a stupid, cruel, selfish stunt
like that again?

11:54.313 --> 11:56.406
-No.
-Promise?

11:56.615 --> 11:58.515
Promise. Cross my heart.

11:59.552 --> 12:01.213
Now, who loves you?

12:01.854 --> 12:04.118
-My mom.
-Who else?

12:06.125 --> 12:07.490
Baby Jesus?

12:07.960 --> 12:09.552
Funny. Who else?

12:11.297 --> 12:13.458
-You?
-Yeah.

12:15.267 --> 12:17.895
But I guess you want proof of that,
don't you?

12:18.070 --> 12:19.560
Proof is good.

12:21.874 --> 12:24.172
It's a little late, but...

12:26.545 --> 12:28.775
-happy birthday.
-Thanks.

12:29.915 --> 12:31.644
I like the artwork.

12:33.953 --> 12:35.477
Let's see here.

12:36.422 --> 12:40.859
"Rock 'n' Roll Revival,
Varsity Stadium in Toronto...

12:40.926 --> 12:44.020
"starring John Lennon
and the Plastic Ono Band."

12:44.096 --> 12:46.394
Jessie, where did you get these?

12:49.201 --> 12:52.227
How do you cut yourself
shaving in a fucking bathtub?

12:52.304 --> 12:55.762
That's just fucking clumsy.
Who shaves in a bathtub anyway?

12:55.841 --> 12:57.570
Only chicks take baths, man.

12:57.643 --> 12:58.974
-Shut up, Hector.
-Shut up?

12:59.044 --> 13:02.138
Show him the picture you took.
He sold it to the school paper.

13:02.214 --> 13:04.705
-Got $25, man.
-You going to split it with me?

13:05.951 --> 13:08.317
-It is my naked ass in the paper.
-Well....

13:08.387 --> 13:11.379
-Just fucking with you, man. Lighten up.
-See? I told you.

13:11.457 --> 13:14.449
He ain't depressed if he's fucking with you.
It was an accident.

13:14.527 --> 13:17.291
Look, you don't accidentally
slice your wrists.

13:17.363 --> 13:20.992
Hector Passmore here passed out
as soon as he saw a little blood in the tub.

13:21.066 --> 13:24.467
I didn't pass out,
I just felt a little woozy, is all.

13:24.537 --> 13:27.529
I'm a pacifist, man.
I don't dig the sight of spilled blood.

13:27.606 --> 13:31.940
-Tell Archie it was an accident.
-I'd really rather not talk about it right now.

13:32.178 --> 13:33.440
See?

13:33.712 --> 13:35.771
Whoa! Asshole!

13:38.651 --> 13:41.211
Can I take a picture of your stitches?

13:41.687 --> 13:44.121
Would you guys mind
getting the car for me?

13:44.190 --> 13:47.125
Right, we'll get the car.

13:53.432 --> 13:55.457
Can Alan come out and play?

13:59.505 --> 14:00.995
Are you okay?

14:02.908 --> 14:05.741
You weren't just setting me up, were you?

14:06.345 --> 14:09.075
-Alan....
-It's okay, I'm not going to...

14:09.748 --> 14:12.114
rip out my stitches or anything.

14:14.386 --> 14:16.149
It's true, isn't it?

14:16.455 --> 14:18.446
I care about you so much.

14:18.924 --> 14:21.324
Then tell me the truth. I'll be okay.

14:21.393 --> 14:24.191
I'm just trying to evolve here.

14:26.765 --> 14:29.393
It's like you have a wall around you.

14:29.935 --> 14:32.597
Like a moat to keep out your enemies.

14:34.940 --> 14:36.669
I'm not your enemy.

14:39.078 --> 14:40.807
I'm sorry, Jessica.

14:44.283 --> 14:46.251
I figure we get fucked up...

14:46.318 --> 14:49.549
go out, swipe a couple bags of candy
from trick-or-treaters...

14:49.622 --> 14:52.887
then check out the Halloween party
at Kappa Gamma Nu.

14:52.958 --> 14:55.756
-Far out.
-Who wants to go to Toronto?

14:56.195 --> 14:59.596
As long as I can hold on
to my student deferment, I'm cool right here.

14:59.665 --> 15:03.157
-They got Halloween in Canada?
-I don't know, but they got this.

15:03.235 --> 15:04.566
What is it?

15:04.637 --> 15:07.265
Only John Lennon
and the Plastic Ono Band.

15:07.673 --> 15:10.233
-No way!
-Out-fucking-standing!

15:10.309 --> 15:13.176
-Where'd you get them?
-From Jessica, for my birthday.

15:13.245 --> 15:14.872
Isn't she going?

15:15.881 --> 15:16.905
No.

15:16.982 --> 15:20.418
-You're okay to travel, right? I mean....
-Man, he's okay!

15:20.552 --> 15:23.749
I told you it was an accident!
Tell him you're okay, Alan.

15:23.822 --> 15:28.452
If everyone wants to know so bad that
I'm all right I'll take out an ad in <i>The Voice.</i>

15:28.560 --> 15:31.461
John "I am the fucking walrus" Lennon!

15:31.697 --> 15:34.165
-Can I touch them?
-Don't let him, he's fucked up.

15:34.233 --> 15:37.293
-So are you!
-Yeah, but I can maintain better than you.

15:37.503 --> 15:38.595
Shit!

15:42.408 --> 15:45.241
-You only got two tickets?
-Dibs. I got the car. I'm driving.

15:45.311 --> 15:46.573
I got the tickets.

15:46.645 --> 15:49.705
We'll all chip in and
buy the third ticket when we get there.

15:49.782 --> 15:51.340
When do we go?

15:53.552 --> 15:55.110
How about tonight?

15:55.754 --> 15:56.982
Radical!

16:02.561 --> 16:05.428
You think the other Beatles might show up?

16:06.365 --> 16:09.596
Lennon's there going,
"This is an oldie, but a goodie..."

16:09.668 --> 16:12.159
and rips into <i>I Want to Hold Your Hand</i>
or something...

16:12.237 --> 16:14.603
and Paul, George, and Ringo
walk on stage...

16:14.673 --> 16:17.073
and everybody just goes fucking apeshit!

16:17.343 --> 16:21.336
As far as I'm concerned,
it's anything-can-happen day.

16:22.381 --> 16:24.042
The Beatles, man!

16:26.518 --> 16:29.282
-You know what's going to be weird?
-What?

16:29.421 --> 16:32.913
When they get old.
What's it going to be like...

16:32.992 --> 16:36.223
when Lennon and Hendrix and Janis...

16:36.295 --> 16:39.594
and Jim Morrison
and all the gods of rock 'n' roll are like...

16:39.665 --> 16:42.293
old and fat and bald and shit?

16:42.634 --> 16:45.102
lt'll be a world I don't want to live in.

16:45.504 --> 16:46.766
Amen, brother.

16:50.642 --> 16:54.738
Don't answer it. It's gonna be Jessica
and she's gonna want her tickets back.

16:54.813 --> 16:58.010
-Don't be ridiculous. It is not.
-It is. Don't answer!

16:58.117 --> 17:00.142
It's bad news, I know it.

17:01.620 --> 17:04.180
-Hello?
<i>-Hi, Alan. It's me.</i>

17:04.723 --> 17:07.624
I'm sorry I said what I said. I love you.

17:08.160 --> 17:12.221
Let's run away to Toronto and forget
about the rest of the world for a few days.

17:12.297 --> 17:14.458
Okay? Please?

17:16.435 --> 17:18.425
Please don't answer it.

17:21.540 --> 17:23.531
-Hello?
<i>-Alan Parker?</i>

17:24.410 --> 17:25.741
That's right.

17:25.810 --> 17:29.178
<i>This is Janey McCurdy.</i>
<i>You know, next door to your mama?</i>

17:30.282 --> 17:32.580
Hi, Mrs. McCurdy.

17:33.786 --> 17:35.754
What is it? Is my mom okay?

17:38.057 --> 17:41.151
It was a stroke.
It happened in the restaurant.

17:42.127 --> 17:43.389
Oh, Jesus.

17:51.437 --> 17:55.339
<i>I don't want you going off all halfcocked.</i>
<i>The doctors think she'll be okay.</i>

17:55.407 --> 17:57.466
-Who is it?
-Shut up!

18:00.612 --> 18:02.739
Is she still in the hospital?

18:03.082 --> 18:05.516
Yes, and under the best of care.

18:06.118 --> 18:08.985
You are not going to Toronto
with Cheech and Chong here...

18:09.054 --> 18:12.751
while your mom's lying in a hospital
120 miles away, maybe dying.

18:12.925 --> 18:15.655
When do you think you'll be coming down,
Alan? Saturday?

18:23.969 --> 18:25.300
Tell her I'll be there tonight.

18:25.370 --> 18:26.496
-What?
-No!

18:27.139 --> 18:29.539
<i>Won't your mama be so happy to see you?</i>

18:30.476 --> 18:31.875
Thanks. Bye.

18:34.113 --> 18:35.478
What is it?

18:36.915 --> 18:41.181
It's my mom. She's in the hospital
down in Lewiston. She had a stroke.

18:41.653 --> 18:43.553
Shit. I'm sorry, Alan.

18:44.189 --> 18:45.656
What about Toronto?

18:45.724 --> 18:48.989
You guys go ahead.
I got to make sure my mom's okay.

19:42.214 --> 19:43.511
<i>Look, Ma!</i>

20:29.428 --> 20:31.157
I got a gold star, Ma.

20:44.409 --> 20:46.377
What's the matter, Mama?

20:48.380 --> 20:50.177
Oh, baby.

20:51.083 --> 20:52.175
What?

20:55.420 --> 20:57.513
It's gonna be okay, sweet pea.

20:59.391 --> 21:01.154
Why are you crying?

21:04.229 --> 21:05.821
It's your daddy.

21:10.802 --> 21:14.932
A loving husband, a good father,
a generous friend....

21:18.510 --> 21:20.842
It's just you and me now, baby.

21:22.681 --> 21:26.310
Alan and Jean Parker against the world.

22:02.621 --> 22:03.645
No!

22:48.400 --> 22:51.699
-Thanks for the ride.
-Not a problem, man.

22:51.770 --> 22:54.295
-Where you headed?
-Down to Lewiston.

22:54.406 --> 22:56.533
I can take you up to Hampton Center, man.

22:56.608 --> 22:57.973
Far out. Thanks.

22:58.710 --> 23:01.178
-You want to get high?
-No, that's okay.

23:02.981 --> 23:04.778
What are you, a narc?

23:05.550 --> 23:07.984
No, I'm not a narc.

23:08.253 --> 23:11.689
No, because if you're a narc,
you'd have to say you're a narc, right?

23:11.757 --> 23:13.486
What's in Lewiston?

23:15.060 --> 23:17.028
I've gotta see my mom in the hospital.

23:17.095 --> 23:18.960
Shit. What is she, sick?

23:19.431 --> 23:22.628
No, she hangs out there,
pulls tricks for a few extra bucks.

23:22.701 --> 23:24.328
Kind of a hobby.

23:25.170 --> 23:26.694
She had a stroke.

23:26.772 --> 23:29.502
That's a drag. My mom died in a hospital.

23:29.808 --> 23:33.437
Heavy shit. She had lung cancer.
She weighed like 75 pounds when she died.

23:33.512 --> 23:36.640
Thanks for sharing that, asshole.
I feel much better now.

23:36.715 --> 23:37.739
I'm sorry.

23:37.816 --> 23:40.341
Yeah, I ain't.
She was a real DAR bitch, you know.

23:40.419 --> 23:43.718
Her and my dad really big on oppression.
<i>Sieg heil,</i> that whole thing.

23:43.789 --> 23:46.622
Actually, my mom's
Another Mother for Peace.

23:47.159 --> 23:50.253
Oh, that's cool. Were you in the service?

23:50.328 --> 23:53.354
No. Student deferment. You?

23:53.465 --> 23:56.263
Fuck, no, man.
They tried to drag my ass to Vietnam.

23:56.334 --> 23:59.963
I'm not going down there, man.
I'm not going to go get killed. I dig life.

24:00.038 --> 24:02.336
"Give peace a chance," right?

24:03.275 --> 24:07.143
I'll tell you what, pretty soon all the over-30s
are going to be six feet under.

24:07.212 --> 24:10.272
Then we'll see. Did you go to Woodstock?

24:10.382 --> 24:12.646
-No.
-You missed out, bro.

24:13.018 --> 24:16.647
Righteous weed, skinny-dipping,
naked chicks.

24:16.755 --> 24:18.347
Here, take this.

24:38.977 --> 24:40.877
What the fuck was that?

24:44.449 --> 24:47.543
What a trip, man. Are you all right, brother?

24:49.454 --> 24:52.617
-What's with the wig?
-Shit, man!

24:53.825 --> 24:55.156
Hey, man. Shit.

24:57.696 --> 24:59.459
-This yours?
-Listen.

24:59.564 --> 25:03.330
You know, they called me a baby killer
I'm no fucking baby killer.

25:03.435 --> 25:07.838
I'm not gonna be a part of that war machine.
Look at me. I'm one of you.

25:08.373 --> 25:12.571
You're not one of me,
you weekend hippie asshole.

25:13.278 --> 25:17.044
-And you're a shitty driver.
-What kind of attitude is that?

25:18.517 --> 25:20.644
Where are you going, man?

25:22.888 --> 25:24.412
Where's that joint?

26:44.836 --> 26:45.928
Mom?

27:20.105 --> 27:22.198
What the fuck are you looking at?

28:29.841 --> 28:31.900
Come on, let's move along.

28:33.178 --> 28:34.338
Move along, please.

29:10.181 --> 29:12.274
Hey, Alan, you need a ride?

29:27.732 --> 29:29.324
What is it, hon?

29:33.404 --> 29:34.996
How did Dad die?

29:37.008 --> 29:40.102
He was killed in a car accident.
You know that.

29:40.311 --> 29:43.178
Yeah, I know, but I never really knew how.

29:45.216 --> 29:46.877
How did it happen?

29:54.292 --> 29:58.228
He was coming home one night...

29:58.296 --> 30:01.265
from a meeting he had out in Castle Rock.

30:02.200 --> 30:04.430
And his car ran out of gas...

30:05.003 --> 30:06.800
on Route Two, you know...

30:07.972 --> 30:09.837
the middle of nowhere.

30:11.209 --> 30:13.643
He was just walking down the road...

30:14.078 --> 30:16.911
when someone just ran right into him.

30:19.551 --> 30:24.250
When they finally found your daddy,
he was still holding on to the gas can.

30:36.234 --> 30:39.726
I honestly don't know what I'd do
if I didn't have you.

30:41.840 --> 30:43.603
Do you remember him?

30:44.475 --> 30:46.033
Not so much.

30:47.745 --> 30:49.372
I wish you could.

30:49.781 --> 30:52.409
You're so much like him it scares me.

30:56.254 --> 30:59.382
You get on up to Orono
and make me proud, okay?

31:02.594 --> 31:04.118
Be careful, Al.

31:09.334 --> 31:13.168
All right, son, let's perambulate along.
Nothing to see here.

31:47.739 --> 31:48.899
Hello?

31:54.445 --> 31:56.072
What do you want?

32:01.619 --> 32:03.018
Who are you?

32:10.495 --> 32:11.553
Dad?

32:16.467 --> 32:18.492
She lied to you, you know.

32:58.242 --> 33:01.541
-Hop on in, son. It's bugger-cold out there.
-Thanks.

33:15.693 --> 33:17.820
I'm heading on down to Bowdoinham.

33:19.797 --> 33:21.697
He trying to catch something?

33:22.266 --> 33:25.565
You know, my wife Aleka, bless her soul,
she used to say...

33:25.770 --> 33:30.207
I would end up in a ditch with a knife
in my back picking up hitchhikers.

33:30.274 --> 33:32.640
But every time I see
a young fellow like you...

33:32.710 --> 33:35.645
standing on the side of the road,
I think of my younger days.

33:35.713 --> 33:37.271
I appreciate it.

33:37.882 --> 33:39.850
Yeah. Where you headed, son?

33:40.985 --> 33:43.647
Central Maine General Hospital
down in Lewiston.

33:43.721 --> 33:46.155
-Yeah.
-My mother had a stroke.

33:47.792 --> 33:49.623
I'm sorry to hear that.

33:50.428 --> 33:53.056
-They think she'll be okay.
-Yeah.

33:54.032 --> 33:57.661
Stroke's what claimed my Allie,
not four years back.

33:58.369 --> 34:01.395
She just started babbling stuff,
not making a lick of sense.

34:01.472 --> 34:04.532
After a while she just sort of
petered out, you know.

34:05.576 --> 34:07.339
I miss her terrible.

34:08.679 --> 34:12.513
On long drives,
I can still see her face sometimes...

34:14.685 --> 34:16.812
sitting right there where you are.

34:23.728 --> 34:25.127
Damn!

34:26.898 --> 34:31.164
You know, I'd take you all the way,
but I promised my brother Ralph...

34:31.302 --> 34:34.328
that I'd take him
over to that nursing home in Gates.

34:34.505 --> 34:37.906
His wife's up there,
she's got that forgetting disease...

34:37.975 --> 34:40.705
what do you call it,
Anderson's or whatever it is.

34:40.777 --> 34:44.077
-Alzheimer's.
-Alzheimer's, yeah. That's the fellow.

34:45.550 --> 34:48.643
Still, I suppose I could take you all the way.

34:49.053 --> 34:51.783
Don't let him.
There's something wrong with him.

34:55.193 --> 34:59.596
You don't have to do that.
I can get a ride from Gates easy.

35:01.032 --> 35:03.330
Damn, damn truss!

35:06.504 --> 35:08.631
Damn rupture!
You know, pardon my French...

35:08.706 --> 35:11.402
but if you stick around
this old world long enough...

35:11.476 --> 35:14.741
after a while all your works
start falling apart, you know.

35:14.879 --> 35:17.575
It just seems like the longer you live...

35:17.648 --> 35:20.481
the more God wants to kick you in the ass.

35:21.519 --> 35:26.081
Still, it's good that you dropped everything
to go see your mom the way you're doing.

35:27.125 --> 35:28.956
She's a good mom.

35:30.128 --> 35:31.527
Okay, Mrs. Parker.

35:33.498 --> 35:35.693
Well. This must be little Al.

35:36.701 --> 35:38.430
Alan. Who are you?

35:39.270 --> 35:41.761
This is Mr. Dalrymple from the ADC.

35:42.974 --> 35:45.841
I think I have everything
I need for now, Mrs. Parker.

35:45.910 --> 35:47.502
-Good. We'll be in touch.
-Thank you.

35:47.578 --> 35:50.479
-Thanks for the coffee and cookies.
-You're welcome.

35:51.215 --> 35:53.775
-Son.
-Goodbye!

35:55.820 --> 35:58.755
-What's ADC?
-He says it's Aid to Dependent Children...

35:58.823 --> 36:01.758
but I think it's Awful Damn Crapheads.

36:02.160 --> 36:04.560
Gotta pucker up
and smooch his white heinie...

36:04.629 --> 36:09.066
just to make sure he writes a good report,
so we can get an extra $50 a month.

36:09.233 --> 36:11.724
-What?
-"Awful Damn Crapheads"?

36:17.108 --> 36:19.872
It's just you and me against the world, Al.

36:28.619 --> 36:29.677
Mom?

36:55.813 --> 36:57.610
It got so my Allie...

36:58.916 --> 37:01.476
didn't even know her own name.

37:02.420 --> 37:06.220
She had that look in her eye,
like she's saying, "Let me out of here."

37:07.158 --> 37:10.924
I mean, if she could think of the words
to say. You know what I mean?

37:18.836 --> 37:19.894
Mom?

37:22.740 --> 37:24.605
There's nothing we can really do for her.

37:24.675 --> 37:28.008
She's going to need someone to care for her
for the rest of her life.

37:28.079 --> 37:30.980
That's your job,
which means quitting school, of course...

37:31.048 --> 37:33.482
and any semblance of a life
that you may have had.

37:35.886 --> 37:39.378
Yeah. I know what you mean.

37:44.528 --> 37:47.861
Look at that.
Look at that harvest moon, son.

37:48.232 --> 37:49.961
Ain't she a corker?

37:50.334 --> 37:52.564
Make a wish on it, boy!

37:53.638 --> 37:56.732
<i>I wish my mom knows me</i>
<i>when I walk into her room.</i>

37:56.807 --> 37:59.435
<i>That her eyes would light up</i>
<i>and she'd say my name.</i>

37:59.510 --> 38:02.138
I wouldn't fuck with wishes if I were you.

38:02.380 --> 38:04.507
Remember <i>The Monkey's Paw?</i>

38:05.850 --> 38:07.875
I wish my Allie was here.

38:29.206 --> 38:32.607
Oh, to hell with Ralph.

38:33.444 --> 38:36.607
Why don't I just take you right on down
to Lewiston with me, son?

38:36.681 --> 38:40.515
Just take you right on down there with me.
What would you say?

38:41.285 --> 38:44.777
Don't do it!
It's another 20 miles of the stink of piss...

38:44.922 --> 38:48.790
and weaving across lanes
till we get hit head on by some Mack truck!

38:48.859 --> 38:51.089
He's dying, man! Can't you smell it?

38:51.228 --> 38:54.197
-What do you say, son?
-No, that's okay.

38:54.899 --> 38:58.767
You take care of your brother. He needs you
as much as my mom needs me.

38:58.903 --> 39:03.101
To hell with Ralph! To hell with him!
I'll take you right to the hospital door...

39:03.174 --> 39:05.642
even though we never met before.
What do you say, son?

39:05.710 --> 39:08.474
What do you say? I'll take you right there!

39:08.546 --> 39:10.104
No, it's okay.

39:13.818 --> 39:17.379
Thanks. I can go out that way.
I can get a ride in no time.

39:18.622 --> 39:22.183
Yeah, best you do that.

39:22.360 --> 39:23.918
Get a ride outside of town.

39:23.994 --> 39:27.020
Nobody would give you a ride inside town,
you know.

39:27.298 --> 39:28.390
Okay.

39:28.566 --> 39:31.535
You sure, now? A bird in the hand....

39:31.602 --> 39:34.127
I'll be okay. Thank you.

39:34.872 --> 39:36.362
Any time, son.

39:38.709 --> 39:40.506
My wife Allie....

39:41.412 --> 39:42.811
What's that?

40:31.162 --> 40:33.255
What's the matter with you?

40:33.898 --> 40:37.857
It was just a sad old man
with leaky plumbing in a sad old car.

40:38.602 --> 40:40.627
There was nobody in there with him.

40:40.704 --> 40:43.332
It was just a reflection or something.

40:44.375 --> 40:46.570
What the hell were you so afraid of?

40:46.744 --> 40:49.736
You were afraid you might
catch what he's got.

40:50.514 --> 40:52.948
Sometimes it's right to be afraid.

40:53.551 --> 40:55.519
I'm not afraid of death.

40:55.853 --> 40:57.650
Oh, yeah, that's right.

40:58.789 --> 41:01.087
You're the fucking Prince of Darkness.

41:16.640 --> 41:18.232
Here we go.

41:20.511 --> 41:22.172
Get a job, faggot!

41:23.047 --> 41:24.514
Hey, fuck you!

41:30.488 --> 41:32.479
Oh, shit!

42:45.596 --> 42:46.995
There he is!

46:31.789 --> 46:32.949
Pussy.

46:57.748 --> 47:00.581
Go on! Go home!

47:02.486 --> 47:04.317
Go on, go! Get! Go!

47:49.466 --> 47:50.694
Jesus.

48:16.526 --> 48:19.051
Don't you wanna see me before I die?

48:20.631 --> 48:22.326
Of course I do, Mom.

48:22.966 --> 48:25.560
Then why do you keep turning down rides?

48:27.104 --> 48:30.562
Fun is fun and done is done.

48:32.576 --> 48:34.237
Don't you love me?

49:25.929 --> 49:27.089
Freezing.

49:54.691 --> 49:57.421
-Look how high we are.
-Why did we do this?

50:21.318 --> 50:24.116
-Mom, let's go.
-What?

50:25.455 --> 50:27.082
I just want to go.

50:27.591 --> 50:30.685
Al, you've been bugging me all weekend
to ride the Bullet.

50:30.761 --> 50:32.991
I know. I just wanna go.

50:33.363 --> 50:35.923
If you're gonna make me wait
in the freezing cold...

50:35.999 --> 50:39.867
-you're going to go on the goddamned ride!
-I changed my mind. I can't.

50:40.504 --> 50:43.029
That's it. That's the last time, buddy boy!

50:43.240 --> 50:45.538
I've had it with your nonsense!

52:20.871 --> 52:22.532
"George Staub."

52:24.574 --> 52:27.407
Jesus, he died two years ago today.

52:29.279 --> 52:31.975
Yeah, but he was born on your birthday.

52:34.951 --> 52:37.852
-"Fun is fun."
-And done is done.

52:39.556 --> 52:41.114
Oh, shit.

52:42.392 --> 52:43.859
Mom's dead.

52:55.472 --> 52:57.667
We're saving a place for you!

53:09.119 --> 53:10.848
That didn't happen.

53:11.254 --> 53:14.951
You're in a graveyard, on your way
to see your mom in the hospital.

53:15.525 --> 53:17.789
You're riding with every maniac on the road.

53:17.861 --> 53:20.227
You think you're in a horror movie,
but you're not.

53:20.297 --> 53:23.232
You're just trying to get home to see Mom.

53:24.701 --> 53:27.499
If you just walk out of here now
without looking back...

53:27.571 --> 53:30.631
you can go on believing that
for the rest of your life.

53:32.075 --> 53:33.440
Fuck that.

53:39.883 --> 53:41.874
You know that's not what it said.

53:41.952 --> 53:43.317
I just read it wrong.

53:43.386 --> 53:45.786
Bullshit.
It said, "Fun is fun and done is done."

53:45.855 --> 53:47.755
-Mom's dead.
-No.

54:13.283 --> 54:16.218
-Thanks for the ride.
-Not a problem.

54:22.425 --> 54:24.825
-Headed up to the city?
-Sure am.

54:25.495 --> 54:27.019
Cool. Me, too.

54:31.935 --> 54:34.631
Maybe we should have taken another car.

54:35.605 --> 54:38.699
-What are you doing up in the city?
-Don't tell him.

54:38.908 --> 54:41.604
There's something's wrong here.
Don't tell him.

54:41.678 --> 54:45.739
My brother's getting married.
I'm gonna be his best man.

54:46.449 --> 54:50.408
Rehearsal's tomorrow,
plus a stag party after.

54:51.054 --> 54:52.214
Yeah?

54:53.089 --> 54:56.024
Your brother's getting married. That's good.

55:00.463 --> 55:03.591
-What's your name?
-Lie!

55:04.401 --> 55:07.336
Hector. Hector Passmore.

55:10.240 --> 55:14.074
There's something really wrong here.
You're never gonna make it to Lewiston.

55:14.144 --> 55:16.908
Mom's dead.
You're never gonna make it home.

55:17.113 --> 55:18.808
And what's that awful smell?

55:18.882 --> 55:21.851
Bet you got a lot of shit for that,
back in school?

55:22.852 --> 55:24.046
What?

55:24.220 --> 55:27.018
Name like that. Hector Passmore.

55:27.424 --> 55:29.119
Yeah, I guess so.

55:30.060 --> 55:32.494
Shit, man. I'd have changed it.

55:38.068 --> 55:40.059
Nice to meet you, Hector.

55:41.104 --> 55:42.594
Name's George.

55:44.474 --> 55:46.032
George Staub.

55:49.279 --> 55:52.771
Formaldehyde! That's the smell!
The son of a bitch is dead!

55:56.219 --> 55:57.880
<i>The dead travel fast.</i>

56:04.761 --> 56:06.888
<i>I can't let him know I know.</i>

56:08.331 --> 56:11.129
I dig this song, man. I really dig this song.

56:11.768 --> 56:15.204
<i>Why didn't I go with the old guy</i>
<i>in the truss? What was I so afraid of?</i>

56:15.338 --> 56:16.896
<i>The dead travel fast.</i>

56:16.973 --> 56:19.567
<i>That old fart never moved more than 45.</i>

56:22.879 --> 56:25.973
So, there's nothing like a wedding.

56:27.016 --> 56:31.077
Yeah. Everyone should do it at least twice.

56:31.287 --> 56:34.120
Easy! You can't let him know you know!

56:35.425 --> 56:40.158
At least twice!
Yeah, sounds like my whole fucking family!

56:40.697 --> 56:42.221
Yeah, mine, too.

56:43.666 --> 56:47.397
-There's really nothing like a funeral, right?
-Wedding.

56:48.638 --> 56:52.096
-What?
-Shit. You said "funeral"!

56:53.276 --> 56:55.369
He knows!

56:58.515 --> 57:01.780
God, what's under that hat?

57:15.365 --> 57:16.593
Wedding.

57:17.467 --> 57:19.128
You said "funeral."

57:22.172 --> 57:23.400
Wedding.

57:23.907 --> 57:25.772
Wedding is what I meant to say.

57:25.842 --> 57:28.743
We always say what we mean to say, Hector.

57:29.245 --> 57:31.110
That's what I think.

57:31.548 --> 57:33.379
Me and Sigmund Freud.

57:35.251 --> 57:36.684
He's fucking with you, man.

57:36.753 --> 57:39.916
He knows you saw his grave.
He knows you know he's dead.

57:53.636 --> 57:55.331
Feel all right?

57:56.539 --> 57:57.733
Yeah.

57:58.575 --> 58:02.067
-You sure?
-I'm just a little carsick, I guess.

58:03.246 --> 58:04.713
I think you should let me out.

58:04.781 --> 58:08.512
Maybe if I get a little fresh air,
my stomach will settle down.

58:09.152 --> 58:10.744
Someone else will come along.

58:10.820 --> 58:13.288
Oh, no, I can't let you out here.

58:14.057 --> 58:16.855
In the middle of nowhere? All alone?

58:21.764 --> 58:23.789
Could be hours
before someone came along...

58:23.867 --> 58:26.995
and even if they did,
they might not pick you up.

58:27.070 --> 58:29.402
No way I'm letting you out here.

58:31.341 --> 58:33.707
Crack your window a little.

58:35.178 --> 58:37.578
I know it doesn't smell so great in here.

58:37.647 --> 58:41.879
Hung up one of those air fresheners,
but those things don't work worth a shit.

58:42.986 --> 58:44.214
Of course...

58:44.420 --> 58:47.583
some smells are harder to get rid of
than others.

58:52.996 --> 58:55.191
Reminds me of that story...

58:56.666 --> 59:00.033
about that kid that buys
a brand-new Cadillac for $750.

59:00.103 --> 59:02.071
You heard that story?

59:02.572 --> 59:04.836
I think everybody's heard that story.

59:07.877 --> 59:09.742
Kid wants to buy a car.

59:10.813 --> 59:13.941
<i>Sees a brand-new Caddy sitting out</i>
<i>in front of this guy's house.</i>

59:14.017 --> 59:15.780
<i>"For sale by owner. "</i>

59:16.686 --> 59:19.450
<i>Kid knows he can't afford no Cadillac car.</i>

59:19.689 --> 59:22.123
<i>Can't get within a shout of a Caddy...</i>

59:22.225 --> 59:24.318
<i>but he's curious, you know?</i>

59:25.395 --> 59:27.727
How much does something like this go for?

59:27.797 --> 59:31.927
Kid, this is your lucky day.
$750 and you can drive it away.

59:32.235 --> 59:36.262
Yeah, right. That's about as funny
as a screen door in a submarine.

59:36.539 --> 59:39.804
No joke, kid.
Pony up the cash and she's yours.

59:40.476 --> 59:43.502
Hell, I'll even take a check.
You've got an honest face.

59:43.580 --> 59:45.741
I heard it was a Thunderbird.

59:46.649 --> 59:48.776
T-Bird, Caddy, same shit.

59:49.319 --> 59:50.616
It's a story.

59:51.087 --> 59:53.146
I may only be 17, but I'm no idiot.

59:53.222 --> 59:55.656
Nobody sells a car like this for $750.

59:56.292 --> 59:58.487
I don't want her anymore, son.

59:59.829 --> 01:00:01.228
She smells.

01:00:01.998 --> 01:00:04.228
You can't get a smell like that out.

01:00:04.467 --> 01:00:08.028
I've tried everything you can think of,
and some you can't.

01:00:09.939 --> 01:00:11.270
You see....

01:00:12.241 --> 01:00:14.141
<i>I was on a business trip.</i>

01:00:14.611 --> 01:00:16.943
<i>Gone a couple, three weeks.</i>

01:00:36.432 --> 01:00:37.660
God!

01:00:46.109 --> 01:00:49.704
She must have been dead
practically the whole time he'd been gone.

01:00:50.346 --> 01:00:53.338
I don't know if it was a suicide
or a heart attack or what.

01:00:53.416 --> 01:00:55.543
She's all bloated up...

01:00:55.652 --> 01:00:58.553
and the car, it's filled with that smell...

01:00:58.688 --> 01:01:01.213
and all he wanted to do was sell it.

01:01:01.524 --> 01:01:03.287
That's some story.

01:01:04.260 --> 01:01:06.558
Why wouldn't he just call home?

01:01:06.696 --> 01:01:07.822
What?

01:01:08.464 --> 01:01:10.329
He's gone for weeks on a business trip...

01:01:10.400 --> 01:01:12.595
he doesn't call home
to see how his wife's doing?

01:01:12.669 --> 01:01:15.160
That's sort of beside the point, ain't it?

01:01:15.371 --> 01:01:18.101
I mean, what a bargain! That's the point.

01:01:19.342 --> 01:01:20.570
Who wouldn't be tempted?

01:01:20.643 --> 01:01:23.544
Probably drive the fucking car
with the windows down, right?

01:01:23.613 --> 01:01:26.047
It's a story. Fiction.

01:01:26.749 --> 01:01:29.547
I thought of it
because of the smell in this car.

01:01:29.952 --> 01:01:31.544
Which is a fact.

01:01:37.193 --> 01:01:39.718
Check out this button. Thrill Village.

01:01:41.431 --> 01:01:43.331
That's where I was today.

01:01:43.733 --> 01:01:46.759
My girlfriend was gonna go,
but called and said she was sick.

01:01:46.836 --> 01:01:50.135
You see, she gets these bad cramps
when she's O.T.R.

01:01:50.206 --> 01:01:51.400
It's too bad...

01:01:51.474 --> 01:01:53.408
but what's the alternative?

01:01:53.543 --> 01:01:56.478
No rag at all? Then we'd both be in trouble.

01:01:59.182 --> 01:02:00.774
So I went alone.

01:02:02.318 --> 01:02:03.842
You ever been to Thrill Village?

01:02:06.622 --> 01:02:07.714
Once.

01:02:07.790 --> 01:02:09.018
<i>When I was 12.</i>

01:02:09.759 --> 01:02:13.559
You didn't go alone, did you?
Not if you were 12, you didn't.

01:02:14.030 --> 01:02:17.796
You didn't tell him that!
Not out loud! He's fucking with you.

01:02:17.900 --> 01:02:21.700
You gotta just open the door,
tuck your head under your arms and jump!

01:02:21.804 --> 01:02:25.467
<i>He'd only reach over and grab me</i>
<i>and pull me right back in with him.</i>

01:02:27.310 --> 01:02:29.107
Yeah, my dad took me.

01:02:29.979 --> 01:02:31.241
Your dad?

01:02:34.984 --> 01:02:38.784
Did you ride the Bullet?
I rode that fucker four times!

01:02:41.758 --> 01:02:43.988
Did you ride the Bullet, Alan?

01:02:45.061 --> 01:02:47.052
You told him your name was Hector!

01:02:47.130 --> 01:02:48.961
Don't let him know you know.

01:02:52.001 --> 01:02:55.095
-Yeah, I rode the Bullet.
-No.

01:02:59.509 --> 01:03:01.306
You didn't ride the Bullet.

01:03:03.179 --> 01:03:05.613
I mean, you got in line and everything...

01:03:05.915 --> 01:03:09.908
but you were with your mom,
not your dad. Remember?

01:03:10.219 --> 01:03:11.777
The line was long...

01:03:11.854 --> 01:03:14.721
your mom didn't wanna wait
out there in the cold.

01:03:14.957 --> 01:03:17.050
But you kept hassling her all day.

01:03:17.126 --> 01:03:20.892
And when you finally got to the head
of the line what happened, Alan?

01:03:21.764 --> 01:03:24.528
You chickened out, didn't you? Didn't you?

01:03:26.903 --> 01:03:27.961
Yes.

01:03:31.941 --> 01:03:33.932
When we got close...

01:03:35.077 --> 01:03:37.272
and I saw how high it was...

01:03:39.182 --> 01:03:41.412
how it turned over the top...

01:03:42.819 --> 01:03:45.379
how they screamed when it came down...

01:03:48.257 --> 01:03:49.849
I chickened out.

01:03:52.161 --> 01:03:53.628
And she swatted me.

01:03:55.731 --> 01:03:58.529
She wouldn't talk to me all the way home.

01:03:59.902 --> 01:04:01.870
I never rode the Bullet.

01:04:03.372 --> 01:04:04.839
Until now.

01:04:07.743 --> 01:04:11.042
I stopped by the state line to get some beers
on my way home.

01:04:11.113 --> 01:04:14.082
I was gonna give my girlfriend
this button as a joke.

01:04:15.885 --> 01:04:18.285
But you probably know
what happened then.

01:05:36.232 --> 01:05:39.633
Every Halloween, when the moon is full
and the wind is high...

01:05:39.735 --> 01:05:42.499
you might see George Staub
on Old Ridge Road...

01:05:42.972 --> 01:05:45.805
Iooking for souls. Like yours!

01:05:52.581 --> 01:05:54.606
There's nothing like a funeral, huh?

01:05:54.684 --> 01:05:56.413
Isn't that what you said?

01:05:57.386 --> 01:05:59.251
Let me out. Please.

01:06:00.656 --> 01:06:02.180
Do you know who I am?

01:06:03.859 --> 01:06:05.486
You're a ghost.

01:06:08.197 --> 01:06:10.791
Come on. You can do better than that.

01:06:11.167 --> 01:06:13.260
Casper is a fucking ghost.

01:06:14.370 --> 01:06:18.101
Do I float in the air?
Can you see through me?

01:06:19.809 --> 01:06:21.538
I'm a kind of messenger...

01:06:22.078 --> 01:06:24.603
fucking Western Union
from beyond the grave.

01:06:25.781 --> 01:06:29.148
Guys like me come out
whenever the circumstances are right...

01:06:29.452 --> 01:06:31.977
because we like to play with guys like you.

01:06:32.121 --> 01:06:34.453
Because you are one of us...

01:06:36.392 --> 01:06:37.916
the walking dead.

01:06:40.129 --> 01:06:43.155
Surgeon did good work.
He must have liked you.

01:06:43.733 --> 01:06:46.725
After all, it is your legacy, isn't it?

01:06:48.204 --> 01:06:50.138
-What do you mean?
-You know.

01:06:50.940 --> 01:06:52.874
Since your dad killed himself.

01:06:53.743 --> 01:06:57.839
Do you know how many children of suicides
commit suicide themselves?

01:06:58.681 --> 01:07:00.376
It's your heritage, man.

01:07:01.117 --> 01:07:05.019
My father didn't commit suicide.
He was killed in a car accident.

01:07:05.588 --> 01:07:08.318
-Is that what she told you?
-It's what happened!

01:07:08.524 --> 01:07:09.855
No, Alan.

01:07:11.961 --> 01:07:14.191
Let me tell you what really happened.

01:07:39.889 --> 01:07:40.878
<i>Splat!</i>

01:07:41.323 --> 01:07:43.314
He painted Miss November with his brains.

01:07:43.392 --> 01:07:45.553
That's bullshit!

01:07:46.362 --> 01:07:49.525
Bullshit? You know it's not.

01:07:53.736 --> 01:07:55.101
You know what I think?

01:07:55.171 --> 01:07:57.662
I think whoever runs things
likes to be entertained.

01:07:57.740 --> 01:08:00.470
He always wants to see
if you're happy with what you got...

01:08:00.543 --> 01:08:03.569
or if he can talk you into
what's behind curtain number two.

01:08:03.646 --> 01:08:05.978
But everything has to be just right.

01:08:06.048 --> 01:08:07.777
And tonight it was.

01:08:07.917 --> 01:08:11.819
You out there all by yourself,
needing a ride in the night...

01:08:12.455 --> 01:08:15.253
in the dark, with your fucking wrist.

01:08:15.858 --> 01:08:17.154
And your dad.

01:08:17.225 --> 01:08:18.988
Your mother dying in the hospital.

01:08:19.060 --> 01:08:20.653
She's not dying!

01:08:21.197 --> 01:08:23.165
Yeah, right. Not yet.

01:08:24.834 --> 01:08:29.100
None of this would've happened if I'd stayed
with the old man in the truck, would it?

01:08:29.171 --> 01:08:30.968
That's hard to say.

01:08:31.607 --> 01:08:33.506
Maybe he was dead, too.

01:08:35.778 --> 01:08:37.609
There's no time to talk about that.

01:08:37.680 --> 01:08:40.581
In five miles we're going
to start seeing houses again.

01:08:40.649 --> 01:08:43.618
A few miles past that
is the Lewiston city line.

01:08:43.685 --> 01:08:46.176
Which means you have to decide now.

01:08:47.389 --> 01:08:48.787
Decide what?

01:08:49.258 --> 01:08:52.421
Who rides the Bullet
and who stays on the ground.

01:08:53.162 --> 01:08:54.993
You or your mother.

01:08:55.965 --> 01:08:59.366
-What?
-I'm taking one of you with me, Al.

01:09:00.803 --> 01:09:03.533
Who's it going be? You or your mom?

01:09:04.974 --> 01:09:08.375
-What are you talking about?
-It's time for one of you to die!

01:09:09.812 --> 01:09:12.542
The choice is yours. It's all up to you.

01:09:14.984 --> 01:09:17.042
This shit isn't funny, man.

01:09:18.187 --> 01:09:19.518
I'm serious.

01:09:19.587 --> 01:09:23.080
I'm as serious as cancer.
You've got a choice to make.

01:09:23.459 --> 01:09:24.926
You or Mommy.

01:09:25.294 --> 01:09:27.386
So put on your thinking cap.

01:09:28.731 --> 01:09:29.925
<i>Hi.</i>

01:09:31.200 --> 01:09:33.760
We had peach pie, so I saved you a slice.

01:09:45.080 --> 01:09:46.774
Come here, hon.

01:09:47.550 --> 01:09:50.178
It's you and me against the world, Al.

01:09:52.988 --> 01:09:54.785
What do you say, Al?

01:09:56.358 --> 01:09:59.816
-Time's a-wasting.
-I can't decide something like that.

01:09:59.895 --> 01:10:02.659
-It's not fair to ask me.
-I know.

01:10:04.099 --> 01:10:05.760
They all say that.

01:10:06.669 --> 01:10:10.196
But if you don't decide
by the time we get to that first light...

01:10:10.272 --> 01:10:12.638
I'll just have to take you both.

01:10:12.908 --> 01:10:14.273
Take us where?

01:10:14.343 --> 01:10:17.244
Come on, that's an easy one.

01:10:18.047 --> 01:10:19.639
This is your meat, Al.

01:10:19.715 --> 01:10:22.650
Life obviously doesn't mean
that much to you.

01:10:23.385 --> 01:10:25.683
You just love death, don't you?

01:10:25.921 --> 01:10:30.187
The romance, the mystery,
the dark fucking beauty of it.

01:10:30.726 --> 01:10:33.490
What's the big deal? People die every day.

01:10:33.562 --> 01:10:35.359
A shitload of people.

01:10:36.632 --> 01:10:38.259
It is a big deal.

01:10:38.367 --> 01:10:39.834
I see.

01:10:39.902 --> 01:10:43.133
Have we had a little change of heart,
drama boy?

01:10:43.672 --> 01:10:46.766
What was that,
just a cry for help, O Prince of Darkness?

01:10:46.842 --> 01:10:49.572
-No!
-What the fuck were you thinking?

01:10:49.845 --> 01:10:51.574
What's more valuable than your life...

01:10:51.647 --> 01:10:54.207
all that there is in your future,
hell, right now?

01:10:54.283 --> 01:10:56.308
Come on, just give mom the boot.

01:10:56.385 --> 01:10:58.853
She's already got diabetes,
smokes like a chimney.

01:10:58.921 --> 01:11:02.220
-She doesn't have long left anyway.
-This is bullshit!

01:11:02.358 --> 01:11:04.553
Yeah, they all say that, too.

01:11:07.329 --> 01:11:11.698
You know, I'd just as soon take two as one.
It's more points for me.

01:11:13.369 --> 01:11:17.203
Go ahead, Alan, you're an artist.
Paint the walls, like I did.

01:11:22.878 --> 01:11:25.676
Come on, Al.
We're running out of wilderness.

01:11:25.748 --> 01:11:27.375
What do you say?

01:11:27.783 --> 01:11:29.614
It's time to choose.

01:11:30.286 --> 01:11:34.279
-I'm not going to do that.
-Okay. Then I'll do it for you.

01:11:35.224 --> 01:11:37.158
No.

01:11:48.637 --> 01:11:50.969
This isn't a request, Al baby!

01:11:51.373 --> 01:11:53.364
You're here for a reason.

01:11:53.442 --> 01:11:56.172
It's not fair. You can't make me choose.

01:11:56.312 --> 01:11:58.837
Hey, man, I didn't even have a choice.

01:11:59.181 --> 01:12:00.478
You do.

01:12:00.749 --> 01:12:02.808
I'd take it if I were you.

01:12:03.085 --> 01:12:04.518
<i>I'm only 21.</i>

01:12:04.586 --> 01:12:09.182
<i>I've got a whole life in front of me.</i>
<i>48 is old. She's sick, real sick.</i>

01:12:09.558 --> 01:12:11.492
<i>And it is only a matter of time.</i>

01:12:11.560 --> 01:12:13.255
Your mom worked her ass off for you.

01:12:13.329 --> 01:12:16.423
All those shit jobs to put money away
so you could go to school.

01:12:16.498 --> 01:12:18.227
Hell, so you could even eat.

01:12:18.300 --> 01:12:20.393
Who the fuck are you anyway?

01:12:20.803 --> 01:12:24.364
The angel on his right shoulder
or the devil on his left?

01:12:24.606 --> 01:12:26.540
Then shut the fuck up!

01:12:27.976 --> 01:12:31.605
Who's it going to be, Al?
You or Mommy? Or both?

01:12:31.847 --> 01:12:33.041
No!

01:13:54.730 --> 01:13:57.221
They're coming to get you, Barbara.

01:16:12.367 --> 01:16:15.564
Just settle back and enjoy the ride, Son.

01:16:15.938 --> 01:16:19.669
Why didn't you come, Al?
Why did you let me die all alone?

01:16:20.609 --> 01:16:23.134
We never quite made it to Toronto, man!

01:17:31.079 --> 01:17:32.137
Mom?

01:17:44.893 --> 01:17:47.623
-Is that you?
-Of course it's me.

01:17:48.664 --> 01:17:50.393
He brought me here.

01:17:57.873 --> 01:17:59.898
You have to choose, honey.

01:18:01.176 --> 01:18:03.303
You have to make the choice.

01:18:04.046 --> 01:18:05.946
I can't do that, Mom.

01:18:08.150 --> 01:18:09.583
You have to.

01:18:12.888 --> 01:18:15.015
What's wrong with your hand?

01:18:19.227 --> 01:18:22.754
You ripped the fucking skin off of it,
that's what's wrong!

01:18:25.133 --> 01:18:29.126
You can't run away, Alan.
And you can't kill what's already dead.

01:18:29.237 --> 01:18:32.297
Now quit pissing me off
and make your decision!

01:18:51.226 --> 01:18:54.718
Hurry, Al. Speed it up.
That's the first house.

01:18:54.830 --> 01:18:58.095
If you've got something to tell me,
you better tell me now.

01:18:58.233 --> 01:19:01.396
<i>How do you choose?</i>
<i>How the hell do you choose?</i>

01:19:03.338 --> 01:19:05.636
I've had it with your nonsense!

01:19:06.875 --> 01:19:09.867
<i>Just you and me against the world, Al.</i>

01:19:10.612 --> 01:19:13.604
<i>I honestly don't know what I'd do</i>
<i>if I didn't have you.</i>

01:19:14.616 --> 01:19:16.481
<i>Make me proud, okay?</i>

01:19:24.493 --> 01:19:26.290
<i>Happy birthday!</i>

01:19:27.295 --> 01:19:29.422
Now, Al. Now!

01:19:31.533 --> 01:19:33.797
Is it going to be your mother or you?

01:19:36.471 --> 01:19:38.029
Now, Al!

01:19:39.641 --> 01:19:42.303
Take her! Take my Mom, don't take me!

01:19:46.081 --> 01:19:48.072
Pleasant dreams, Al.

01:20:45.207 --> 01:20:47.175
Where are you headed, son?

01:20:47.709 --> 01:20:50.803
-Lewiston.
-That works for both of us. Come on.

01:20:51.046 --> 01:20:52.479
Thank you.

01:21:13.768 --> 01:21:16.737
Good luck, son.
I hope your mom's on the mend.

01:21:18.039 --> 01:21:19.267
Thanks.

01:21:19.941 --> 01:21:23.502
Did you ride the Bullet?
I rode that fucker four times.

01:21:25.080 --> 01:21:28.447
You all right, son?
You come over all shivery.

01:21:30.752 --> 01:21:32.014
I'm okay.

01:21:33.855 --> 01:21:35.322
Thanks again.

01:22:07.022 --> 01:22:09.752
Hi, I'm here to see Jean Parker.

01:22:10.225 --> 01:22:12.853
I'm sorry, visiting hours end at 9:00.

01:22:13.094 --> 01:22:15.927
She's my mother. She had a stroke.

01:22:16.398 --> 01:22:19.458
I hitchhiked all the way
from Orono to see her.

01:22:20.802 --> 01:22:24.533
We can make the occasional exception
for immediate family, I think.

01:22:24.773 --> 01:22:26.070
Thank you.

01:22:26.841 --> 01:22:29.207
Let's see, that was Parker?

01:22:29.277 --> 01:22:31.268
Right. Jean Parker.

01:22:34.416 --> 01:22:36.384
Let me call Dr. Higgins.

01:22:45.226 --> 01:22:46.284
Okay.

01:22:47.595 --> 01:22:49.893
He'll be here in just a minute.

01:22:51.900 --> 01:22:53.265
Mr. Parker?

01:22:56.271 --> 01:22:59.866
I'm sorry, Alan,
but your mother passed away at about 8:00.

01:23:01.676 --> 01:23:03.769
Let's see, that was Parker?

01:23:04.479 --> 01:23:06.208
Right. Jean Parker.

01:23:07.482 --> 01:23:09.677
I've got to call Dr. Shustek.

01:23:11.486 --> 01:23:13.613
-What is it?
-Hi, Dr. Shustek.

01:23:13.688 --> 01:23:15.713
Jean Parker's son is here.

01:23:15.991 --> 01:23:17.083
Okay.

01:23:18.159 --> 01:23:20.150
Dr. Shustek will be right here.

01:23:21.730 --> 01:23:23.095
Mr. Parker?

01:23:24.799 --> 01:23:27.427
I'm not going to lie to you.
Your mother is a vegetable.

01:23:27.502 --> 01:23:29.697
A rutabaga. A banana squash.

01:23:30.105 --> 01:23:32.005
She's fucked. And so are you.

01:23:33.408 --> 01:23:37.003
Let's see. Here she is, in 487.

01:23:37.379 --> 01:23:40.439
Let me call up and see
if it's okay for you to come up.

01:23:40.548 --> 01:23:42.743
-Is she okay?
-Hang on a second.

01:23:44.853 --> 01:23:48.516
Hi, Annie. Jean Parker's son is here.
Could he come up and see her?

01:23:49.824 --> 01:23:53.282
Annie's just going down to check in on her.
It'll just be a minute.

01:23:53.361 --> 01:23:54.589
Thanks.

01:24:07.108 --> 01:24:08.439
<i>It's real.</i>

01:24:09.778 --> 01:24:11.746
<i>Then why isn't she dead?</i>

01:24:11.913 --> 01:24:13.938
Okay, Annie. I understand.

01:24:14.382 --> 01:24:16.247
I will. Thanks.

01:24:18.319 --> 01:24:21.015
Annie says you can come up,
but just for a few minutes.

01:24:21.089 --> 01:24:24.320
Your mother's had her evening medication,
and she's a little soupy.

01:24:24.392 --> 01:24:25.586
Thanks.

01:25:26.988 --> 01:25:29.821
Mr. Parker? Hurry up, she's going.

01:25:30.358 --> 01:25:33.327
-Going?
-No, I just meant the sedative.

01:25:34.129 --> 01:25:36.063
She's going to sleep, that's all I meant.

01:25:36.131 --> 01:25:39.567
God, I am so stupid. No, she is fine, just....

01:25:40.768 --> 01:25:43.168
-You're not going to faint, are you?
-No.

01:25:57.952 --> 01:26:00.819
I know what you did, Al!

01:26:12.233 --> 01:26:13.325
Alan?

01:26:15.270 --> 01:26:16.430
Honey?

01:26:29.184 --> 01:26:30.913
Now, don't you cry.

01:26:31.686 --> 01:26:33.313
No need for that.

01:26:37.358 --> 01:26:39.383
I came as soon as I heard.

01:26:39.694 --> 01:26:41.457
Mrs. McCurdy called.

01:26:42.463 --> 01:26:46.456
I told her that the weekend would be fine.

01:26:47.068 --> 01:26:49.628
Yeah, to hell with that.

01:26:52.473 --> 01:26:54.270
How did you get here?

01:26:55.476 --> 01:26:56.943
I hitchhiked.

01:26:57.645 --> 01:26:58.805
Gory.

01:27:02.784 --> 01:27:04.911
You have blood in your hair.

01:27:08.590 --> 01:27:11.423
It's nothing, Mom. I bumped my head.

01:27:12.293 --> 01:27:13.590
Not good.

01:27:14.996 --> 01:27:17.430
You have to take care of yourself.

01:27:18.900 --> 01:27:22.597
I think we should let her sleep now.
She's had a rough day.

01:27:23.338 --> 01:27:24.532
I know.

01:27:28.643 --> 01:27:30.133
I'm going, Ma.

01:27:30.778 --> 01:27:33.212
I'll be back first thing tomorrow.

01:27:34.148 --> 01:27:36.139
You get some sleep, okay?

01:27:38.119 --> 01:27:40.019
Sleep. That's all I do.

01:27:48.196 --> 01:27:50.994
I dreamed we were at that amusement park.

01:27:54.736 --> 01:27:55.964
You did?

01:27:56.638 --> 01:27:58.367
Waiting in line...

01:27:59.140 --> 01:28:01.165
for the roller coaster...

01:28:01.809 --> 01:28:04.141
that goes way up high.

01:28:05.813 --> 01:28:07.474
Remember that one?

01:28:08.249 --> 01:28:11.412
-The Bullet.
-The Bullet, yes.

01:28:13.454 --> 01:28:15.183
You were so scared.

01:28:17.992 --> 01:28:19.789
And I shouted at you.

01:28:22.096 --> 01:28:24.064
Shouted and swatted you.

01:28:25.266 --> 01:28:26.995
It's all right, Ma.

01:28:29.070 --> 01:28:31.163
I'm so sorry.

01:28:32.840 --> 01:28:34.831
That was a long time ago.

01:28:37.245 --> 01:28:39.213
You never got your ride.

01:28:40.148 --> 01:28:42.673
Mr. Parker, it really is time to go.

01:28:48.423 --> 01:28:50.516
I'm gonna see you tomorrow.

01:28:52.126 --> 01:28:54.560
-I love you.
-I love you, too.

01:28:57.065 --> 01:28:58.327
So sorry.

01:30:06.834 --> 01:30:10.930
<i>There's nothing like a brush with mortality</i>
<i>to teach you to appreciate life.</i>

01:30:11.239 --> 01:30:14.766
<i>A little bite of death</i>
<i>can help you grow up real quick.</i>

01:30:17.178 --> 01:30:19.806
<i>Mom got out of the hospital a few days later.</i>

01:30:20.148 --> 01:30:24.414
<i>She walked with a limp for a while.</i>
<i>About a month later she was back at work.</i>

01:30:25.953 --> 01:30:29.184
<i>She tried to quit smoking</i>
<i>and for a little while, she did.</i>

01:30:29.390 --> 01:30:33.019
<i>Then I came back for spring break</i>
<i>a day early and there she was....</i>

01:30:37.165 --> 01:30:39.793
<i>We had a couple of pretty good years</i>
<i>after that.</i>

01:30:39.867 --> 01:30:42.267
<i>I visited her most every weekend.</i>

01:30:43.171 --> 01:30:46.538
<i>We'd play gin rummy or talk politics</i>
<i>until all hours.</i>

01:30:47.442 --> 01:30:50.206
<i>Had a bucket-Ioad of laughs,</i>
<i>as she liked to say.</i>

01:31:03.224 --> 01:31:04.282
Mom?

01:31:19.173 --> 01:31:20.800
<i>Then one night...</i>

01:31:22.210 --> 01:31:24.007
<i>she stopped laughing.</i>

01:31:35.189 --> 01:31:38.818
<i>I will never forget</i>
<i>and always regret the choice I'd made.</i>

01:31:40.962 --> 01:31:44.261
<i>The memory of that night</i>
<i>out on the Old Ridge Road never faded...</i>

01:31:44.332 --> 01:31:46.857
<i>and grew dreamlike, as I expected it would.</i>

01:31:50.404 --> 01:31:51.928
I'm sorry, Mom.

01:32:11.192 --> 01:32:13.956
<i>I can't help but think</i>
<i>that maybe George Staub...</i>

01:32:14.262 --> 01:32:15.923
<i>if there really was a George Staub...</i>

01:32:15.997 --> 01:32:18.591
<i>just teased me with a little more time...</i>

01:32:19.200 --> 01:32:20.963
<i>a couple more years.</i>

01:32:22.270 --> 01:32:24.397
<i>But I was glad to have them.</i>

01:32:25.106 --> 01:32:26.903
<i>It unlocked my heart.</i>

01:32:33.948 --> 01:32:36.280
<i>Jessica and I got married a year later...</i>

01:32:36.350 --> 01:32:38.011
<i>but it didn't last.</i>

01:32:38.085 --> 01:32:40.076
<i>It wasn't anybody's fault.</i>

01:32:40.221 --> 01:32:43.054
<i>We tried, but nothing ever seems to last.</i>

01:32:59.106 --> 01:33:02.769
<i>The Beatles never did get together</i>
<i>in Toronto back in 1969.</i>

01:33:03.144 --> 01:33:05.374
<i>They never got together again.</i>

01:33:07.381 --> 01:33:10.839
<i>John Lennon's life was taken</i>
<i>by a maniac with a gun...</i>

01:33:11.319 --> 01:33:14.220
<i>George Harrison's by cigarettes and cancer.</i>

01:33:15.990 --> 01:33:18.584
<i>And I never made a living as an artist.</i>

01:33:20.094 --> 01:33:22.927
<i>But I still paint, because it's what I do.</i>

01:33:26.867 --> 01:33:30.200
<i>I miss my mom</i>
<i>and I still think about her a lot.</i>

01:33:32.173 --> 01:33:34.038
<i>I miss that time, too.</i>

01:33:34.208 --> 01:33:38.804
<i>From the time of her stroke in 1969</i>
<i>to the time of her passing in 1972...</i>

01:33:39.146 --> 01:33:41.137
<i>my world changed forever.</i>

01:33:41.248 --> 01:33:43.182
<i>I think everybody's did.</i>

01:33:43.718 --> 01:33:45.686
<i>Nothing seems to last...</i>

01:33:49.790 --> 01:33:50.950
<i>but the Bullet.</i>

01:33:51.025 --> 01:33:54.893
<i>The Bullet is constant.</i>
<i>The Bullet is always there.</i>
