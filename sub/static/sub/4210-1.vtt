think it was doing?

42:47.190 --> 42:49.067
He was picking
people out.

42:54.656 --> 42:55.949
What?

42:57.075 --> 42:59.202
It can smell
something in people.

42:59.286 --> 43:00.287
In their fear.

43:00.370 --> 43:02.872
Something that helps
it pick people out.

43:04.207 --> 43:05.625
Pick people
out for what?

43:06.501 --> 43:09.337
I don't understand how you
would know that, sweetie.

43:12.048 --> 43:14.009
A dead boy told me.

43:19.139 --> 43:21.641
I think he was
trying to warn me.

43:22.601 --> 43:25.270
He was trying
to warn all of us.

43:26.021 --> 43:27.814
This thing has been around
for thousands of years

43:27.897 --> 43:29.941
and that nothing has
been able to kill it.

43:30.025 --> 43:31.151
This is a dream
you had?

43:31.234 --> 43:33.987
Well, the boy was dead. So, yes, I'm
assuming that it was a dream, Scotty.

43:34.070 --> 43:36.072
You were waving pom-poms
at people this morning.

43:36.156 --> 43:37.490
Now all of a sudden,
you're a psychic hotline?

43:37.574 --> 43:38.617
I don't know!

43:38.700 --> 43:41.411
You wanna explain it
to me? Because I can't.

43:48.209 --> 43:50.462
That boy was
trying to warn us

43:50.545 --> 43:53.381
that by morning it has to
go back into the earth...

43:53.465 --> 43:55.133
Oh, come on.

43:55.216 --> 43:58.511
Into the ground
for 23 more years.

44:00.889 --> 44:04.059
And then what? Lives
happily ever after, huh?

44:05.352 --> 44:06.978
Why don't you clean
out your bong, all right?

44:07.062 --> 44:08.605
Scotty, just
listen to her.

44:08.688 --> 44:09.773
It is coming back.

44:09.856 --> 44:11.524
This is a dream
she had, Rhonda.

44:11.608 --> 44:12.609
What, are you
gonna believe it?

44:12.692 --> 44:14.569
And it doesn't matter if
we're hiding on this bus

44:14.653 --> 44:17.364
or if we're
hiding under our beds.

44:17.447 --> 44:18.865
It'll find us.

44:20.617 --> 44:22.786
The ones that
it picked out.

44:38.551 --> 44:41.471
Minx.
Take it easy, okay?

44:46.559 --> 44:49.062
The boy told me that

44:49.145 --> 44:51.690
it can smell in our fear,

44:51.773 --> 44:53.566
who it wants.

44:55.944 --> 44:58.571
And what from them

44:58.655 --> 45:00.615
it wants to eat.

45:14.462 --> 45:16.840
Hello,
is anyone out there?

45:17.549 --> 45:20.135
Hello. We have
a serious problem out here.

45:20.218 --> 45:23.638
We need help right away.
Can anybody hear me?

45:23.722 --> 45:26.474
Is anybody out there,
please?

45:26.599 --> 45:30.145

Hello? Look,
can you hear me?

46:49.641 --> 46:51.267

still there?

46:51.392 --> 46:52.644
<i>BUCKY: I'm so fucking
still here.</i>

46:52.727 --> 46:55.647
Okay, okay. Just say again
what you just told me.

46:55.730 --> 46:57.106
<i>We're not playing
games here, right?</i>

46:57.190 --> 46:59.025
Just say it, man!

46:59.108 --> 47:03.780
We're trapped in a broken-down
school bus out on East Nine.

47:03.863 --> 47:05.615
And something
is going to kill us

47:05.698 --> 47:08.493
if we don't get help
out here right away.

47:08.576 --> 47:09.911
Where on Nine East?

47:09.994 --> 47:11.955
<i>BUCKY: In Kissel County.
Are you the cops?</i>

47:12.038 --> 47:13.706
What's trying to kill you?

47:13.790 --> 47:15.166
What are you
talking about?

47:15.250 --> 47:17.418
Just tell me,
are you the fucking cops?

I'm already on the Nine.</i>

47:21.506 --> 47:24.092
But it's a big highway
and so is Kissel County.

47:24.175 --> 47:25.677
Are there any
landmarks near you?

47:25.760 --> 47:27.262
Are you close to anything?

47:27.345 --> 47:29.514
Yeah, I'm close to peeing
my fucking pants, man.

47:29.597 --> 47:32.225
Can you just please tell
me that you're on the way?

47:33.268 --> 47:37.730
I can't really judge the strength of
your signal but it doesn't sound close.

47:37.814 --> 47:39.524
<i>BUCKY: What does that mean, man?</i>

47:39.607 --> 47:41.901
It means it's gonna take
me a while to get to you.

47:41.985 --> 47:45.780
Look, we kind of have a
time-critical situation here.

47:45.864 --> 47:47.532
Roger that.

47:47.615 --> 47:49.534
And please tell me that
you're coming with back-up

47:49.617 --> 47:51.202
'cause if you're
not the cops,

47:51.286 --> 47:53.371
you gotta promise me
that you'll call them

47:53.454 --> 47:56.583
and you'll tell them
that we're stuck out here.

47:56.666 --> 47:58.293
I'll call them.

47:58.376 --> 48:00.044
I'll call them right now.

48:00.128 --> 48:01.963
But what you've
gotta do is hang on.

throwing people off this bus?

should say that, D,

it picked out for sure was you.

is the only thing

away from us,

off this bus, man.

01:03:41.610 --> 01:03:43.737
I saw him
and you did, too.

01:03:44.780 --> 01:03:47.950
He looked right
at you and smiled.

01:03:48.867 --> 01:03:51.537
And when you made Jake
take the lights off it,

01:03:51.620 --> 01:03:53.956
he could've looked at you twice
and licked its fucking lips,

01:03:54.039 --> 01:03:55.582
but we don't know that.

01:03:56.750 --> 01:03:58.877

little black list.

01:04:00.212 --> 01:04:04.216

out and I hope he does,

01:04:05.634 --> 01:04:09.972
I'm gonna be the one getting as far
away from your sorry ass as I can.

01:04:20.107 --> 01:04:21.775
I'm gonna go
find that farm.

going with you.

keep this bus?
