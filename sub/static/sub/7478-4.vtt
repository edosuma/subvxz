00:07.415 --> 00:09.716
Passenger
Brooks, please meet your party

00:09.740 --> 00:11.851
in the baggage-claim area,
Carousel 4.

00:11.875 --> 00:13.812
Passenger Brooks, meet your party

00:13.836 --> 00:17.919
in the baggage-claim area,
Carousel 4.

00:22.263 --> 00:25.383
Will passenger Helbard please
pick up the white courtesy phone?

00:25.683 --> 00:30.144
Passenger Helbard,
pick up the white courtesy phone.

00:31.940 --> 00:34.407
Maintenance,
please report to Security Check 5.

00:34.431 --> 00:38.060
Maintenance, please report
to Security Check 5.

00:42.784 --> 00:44.741
Ball cap.

01:04.471 --> 01:06.014
Oh, hey.

01:07.976 --> 01:09.256
Hey. Hey.

01:14.983 --> 01:16.334
Heading for the exit!

01:16.358 --> 01:18.150
Hey! Hey!

01:34.168 --> 01:36.161
Hey, what are you doing?

01:46.973 --> 01:48.764
Hey!

03:23.736 --> 03:27.046
Karen. Yes, I love you.

03:27.070 --> 03:28.295
Karen?

03:28.319 --> 03:30.258
That's the one I've been waiting for.

03:30.282 --> 03:32.301
Oh, does Karen have a last name?

03:32.325 --> 03:34.594
Can't remember.

03:34.618 --> 03:36.224
- You can't remember?
- No.

03:36.248 --> 03:38.135
But God bless her,
she put me over the top.

03:38.159 --> 03:41.703
I now have 1,000 Facebook friends.

03:42.755 --> 03:46.563
I worked so hard for this. Friending
everyone I've ever gone to school with,

03:46.587 --> 03:49.226
worked with, dated, or met.
The toughest part for me

03:49.250 --> 03:52.074
was trolling through the hundreds
and hundreds of random members

03:52.098 --> 03:53.901
for anyone willing
to accept my invite.

03:53.925 --> 03:56.152
Do you know how many criminals
cruise the Internet,

03:56.176 --> 03:58.617
picking through your chat logs,
looking for information?

03:58.641 --> 04:00.532
- You're not on Facebook, are you?
- No.

04:00.556 --> 04:01.870
- MySpace?
- No.

04:01.894 --> 04:03.916
- Linkedln? Twitter?
- No. No.

04:03.940 --> 04:07.087
- Friendster?
- Friendster? I'm an undercover agent.

04:07.111 --> 04:10.210
- I love Friendster.
- That's not normal.

04:10.234 --> 04:13.385
You're telling me what's normal?
I've never seen you wear pants.

04:13.409 --> 04:14.834
I meant Dom.

04:14.858 --> 04:16.995
Friendster's only popular
in Southeast Asia now.

04:17.498 --> 04:20.048
Three of the coolest people
I've ever met are from Myanmar.

04:20.072 --> 04:21.471
The normal's relative.

04:21.495 --> 04:24.350
More often than not,
online social-networking communities

04:24.374 --> 04:26.432
are a pathetic attempt
to fulfil the needs

04:26.456 --> 04:29.230
of the intersocially challenged.

04:29.254 --> 04:32.344
You know, people fearful
of face-to-face risk taking.

04:33.681 --> 04:35.009
It's just a theory.

04:37.226 --> 04:38.970
What is this, Mr. Callen?

04:41.689 --> 04:43.765
That is a knit combed cotton.

04:44.317 --> 04:45.515
With a blood stain.

04:45.776 --> 04:48.267
I would never bleed on your wardrobe.
It had to be a bad guy.

04:48.988 --> 04:51.087
Good, bad, or ugly, I don't care.

04:51.111 --> 04:54.425
The point is
you neglected to tell me about it

04:54.449 --> 04:57.192
and now it's set long enough
so that it might be permanent.

04:57.663 --> 04:59.347
Hetty, it's just a shirt.

04:59.371 --> 05:03.099
No, no, no. This is not just a shirt.

05:03.123 --> 05:08.726
This is a Savile Row,
100 percent polished Egyptian cotton,

05:08.750 --> 05:11.985
hand-stitched with pearl buttons.

05:12.009 --> 05:15.357
That thing you're wearing
is just a shirt.

05:15.381 --> 05:17.465
Yeah, but it's a comfy shirt.

05:20.311 --> 05:23.680
Your new colour scheme is black.

05:25.316 --> 05:27.439
I can live with black.

05:30.613 --> 05:31.739
Oh, Kens.

05:33.824 --> 05:34.939
Late night, huh?

05:39.497 --> 05:41.679
Um...

05:41.703 --> 05:43.950
Agent Blye
has been on assignment.

05:44.835 --> 05:46.294
How did it go, deary?

05:46.879 --> 05:49.121
It went very well.

05:49.674 --> 05:51.975
We gathered very important intel.

05:51.999 --> 05:56.066
That's wonderful. You can return
your outfit to the wardrobe.

05:56.090 --> 05:58.933
Your clothes are waiting
in your locker.

06:01.185 --> 06:02.406
Thank you.

06:02.430 --> 06:04.928
Nice try, Hetty.

06:05.898 --> 06:10.251
Director Vance is on the system
in five. Move.

06:10.275 --> 06:12.236
Hey, Eric.

06:12.822 --> 06:14.625
Why don't you make Hetty
one of your friends?

06:14.649 --> 06:18.074
She's friend number 251.
She writes to me every day.

06:18.869 --> 06:20.696
In Greek.

06:21.080 --> 06:23.132
The man you're looking at
is a former Marine.

06:23.156 --> 06:25.597
Walton Monroe Flynn.

06:25.621 --> 06:28.260
He's currently working
for Citdential Security,

06:28.284 --> 06:30.727
one of the largest
private security firms

06:30.751 --> 06:32.856
contracted by the U.S. Government
in Iraq.

06:32.880 --> 06:36.111
Ten days ago,
Flynn killed an Iraqi businessman

06:36.135 --> 06:38.153
that he was supposed to be
protecting.

06:38.177 --> 06:41.858
He went into hiding. Citdential found
out that he was on his way to L.A.,

06:41.882 --> 06:44.218
tried to take him at the airport
this morning.

06:44.687 --> 06:45.991
They made a mess of it.

06:46.015 --> 06:47.980
One of their men ended up dead.

06:48.316 --> 06:49.490
Cowboys.

06:49.514 --> 06:52.075
That's why the DOD
wants us involved.

06:52.099 --> 06:54.412
You can't have private
security contractors

06:54.436 --> 06:56.712
operating like a police force
on home ground.

06:56.736 --> 07:00.667
It's a political hot potato,
so do not drop it.

07:00.691 --> 07:02.115
We'll find him.

07:02.913 --> 07:04.763
You can start with Citdential's CEO.

07:04.787 --> 07:07.744
His name is Peter Caldwell.

07:08.502 --> 07:10.412
- Eric.
- Director.

07:10.838 --> 07:12.605
Congratulations on the milestone.

07:12.629 --> 07:14.874
Aw, thank you.

07:18.596 --> 07:19.627
Facebook.

07:20.056 --> 07:21.775
He's friend number 500.

07:21.799 --> 07:24.299
He's kind of honoured.

07:28.898 --> 07:31.899
After I became CEO, I personally
recruited Flynn from the Marine Corps.

07:32.860 --> 07:34.912
He was not only an operator,
but an Arabic speaker

07:34.936 --> 07:37.105
and the company needed them.

07:37.740 --> 07:41.548
Three months ago, he started
exhibiting behavioural problems.

07:41.572 --> 07:43.547
What sort of behavioural problems?

07:43.571 --> 07:46.047
He was trigger-happy.
Started drinking heavily.

07:46.071 --> 07:47.707
You left him on the line?

07:48.042 --> 07:50.533
- An oversight.
- An understatement.

07:50.836 --> 07:53.244
So, what happened in Baghdad,
Mr. Caldwell?

07:54.048 --> 07:58.128
Flynn was part of a security detail
protecting an Iraqi businessman.

07:58.427 --> 08:01.606
Nasir Amini was a key player
in the country's stability,

08:01.630 --> 08:05.281
especially with the start
of the U.S. Troop withdrawal.

08:05.305 --> 08:08.596
Flynn snapped. Took Amini out.

08:10.231 --> 08:12.389
He got away
before we could stop him.

08:13.692 --> 08:15.495
Flew out of the Middle East
via Istanbul.

08:15.519 --> 08:18.161
We got a report
he was headed for L.A.

08:18.185 --> 08:20.332
We tried to apprehend him
this morning.

08:20.356 --> 08:22.252
Yeah, that didn't go so well.

08:22.276 --> 08:24.859
Aimes was a good friend.
Flynn didn't need to kill him.

08:25.287 --> 08:26.806
Flynn was one of our best.

08:26.830 --> 08:29.156
He's trained to kill quickly
and efficiently.

08:29.959 --> 08:33.457
He's even more dangerous
now that he's mentally unstable.

08:34.505 --> 08:35.916
We'd like to help you find him.

08:37.549 --> 08:40.087
I think you guys have done enough.

08:40.594 --> 08:42.717
Let us take it from here.

08:44.056 --> 08:47.176
This is the security-cam footage
from LAX.

08:47.893 --> 08:48.984
Looks stressed.

08:49.008 --> 08:52.329
Travel can do that, particularly
if you're on the run for murder.

08:52.353 --> 08:54.812
- Background?
- Broken home.

08:55.943 --> 08:58.492
Dad busted in a drug conspiracy
when Flynn turned 7.

08:58.516 --> 08:59.751
Mom was a drunk.

08:59.775 --> 09:02.212
- That's a great start.
- Oh, it gets better.

09:02.236 --> 09:05.634
String of foster homes,
a few trips to juvie.

09:05.658 --> 09:08.639
He signed up for the Marines
the day he turned 18.

09:08.663 --> 09:12.674
And the military gave him the family
and structure that he never had.

09:12.698 --> 09:15.426
The only other choice
would have been a gang.

09:15.450 --> 09:17.265
Why did he pick one over the other?

09:17.289 --> 09:19.706
It was a chance
to get away from it all.

09:22.219 --> 09:25.054
Gangs give you structure,
but they keep you in the same place.

09:25.681 --> 09:27.317
The military's all about starting over.

09:27.341 --> 09:31.265
Unless you start
to repeat your behaviour.

09:31.729 --> 09:34.326
Flynn's military record shows
commendations for bravery,

09:34.350 --> 09:36.682
but there's also a handful of side trips
to the brig.

09:37.985 --> 09:39.942
Run the video, Eric.

09:43.199 --> 09:46.983
Flynn bolted from the terminal
with two Citdential agents on his tail.

09:49.497 --> 09:52.581
Outside the terminal, they chased him
across three lanes of traffic

09:53.042 --> 09:57.229
where a third Citdential picked him up
as he ran into a parking garage.

09:57.253 --> 09:59.746
Flynn evaded the agent
in a stolen car.

10:01.091 --> 10:03.274
The chase wound up on the roof.

10:03.298 --> 10:04.904
When the agent started firing,

10:04.928 --> 10:09.069
Flynn mowed him down with the car
and took off on foot.

10:09.093 --> 10:10.273
Brutal.

10:10.297 --> 10:12.848
Any other insights, Nate?

10:17.191 --> 10:19.788
The question is, where did he go?

10:19.812 --> 10:24.006
The logical answer would be as
far away from the airport as possible.

10:24.030 --> 10:27.199
Spock said, "Logic is the beginning
of wisdom, not the end."

10:29.036 --> 10:30.292
- Double back.
- Double back.

10:30.316 --> 10:32.038
Fast forward, Eric.

10:36.502 --> 10:37.533
There's our guy.

10:38.003 --> 10:39.604
He went back to the terminal.

10:39.628 --> 10:42.003
He was waiting for someone
to pick him up.

10:42.675 --> 10:44.751
You gotta love Star Trek.

10:57.981 --> 10:59.748
Double espresso
was speaking to me.

10:59.772 --> 11:03.500
Been hearing voices
from caffeinated beverages long?

11:03.524 --> 11:05.996
Since the brownies started
giving me the silent treatment.

11:06.020 --> 11:08.082
- Couple of things you should know.
- All ears.

11:08.106 --> 11:10.666
Citdential sent Flynn's psych profile.
It's juicy stuff.

11:10.690 --> 11:14.072
- Baited breath. What else do you got?
- Hetty's in the kitchen.

11:14.747 --> 11:16.930
All indicators point
towards a psychotic break.

11:16.954 --> 11:20.719
My guess is undiagnosed PTSD
complicated by his upbringing.

11:20.743 --> 11:22.225
What about his upbringing?

11:22.249 --> 11:23.892
Possible abuse in foster homes.

11:23.916 --> 11:26.308
Probably didn't know his parents
or where he came from.

11:26.332 --> 11:28.561
A childhood like that
can cause psychological...

11:28.585 --> 11:30.042
I get it.

11:31.514 --> 11:32.925
Uh, okay.

11:33.558 --> 11:39.121
Something I don't get is he might have
had a breakdown in Iraq,

11:39.145 --> 11:42.350
but he certainly was lucid
about his trip to L.A.

11:42.650 --> 11:44.418
He could have gotten
off on the East Coast,

11:44.442 --> 11:46.354
but instead, he flew straight here.

11:46.863 --> 11:48.855
He's in L.A. For a reason.

11:49.240 --> 11:50.247
Ragtop Jeep.

11:50.271 --> 11:52.714
Surf racks on the roof,
bumper stickers on the rear.

11:52.738 --> 11:55.460
Rear licence plate was blocked
by the spare tyre.

11:55.484 --> 11:56.968
No plate on the front.

11:56.992 --> 11:58.623
Well, what kind of bumper stickers?

11:59.334 --> 12:02.061
"I had a handle on life, but it broke.

12:02.085 --> 12:04.388
Don't steal,
the government hates competition."

12:04.412 --> 12:06.356
And my personal favourite,

12:06.380 --> 12:08.814
"Be sincere,
whether you mean it or not."

12:08.838 --> 12:10.255
Speaking of the driver...

12:10.887 --> 12:14.777
No facial, tats on the left arm.
Male or female.

12:14.801 --> 12:16.658
- Male.
- Woman.

12:16.682 --> 12:17.990
Yeah.

12:18.014 --> 12:20.309
More on the tats.

12:23.358 --> 12:24.733
Tebori style.

12:25.985 --> 12:29.401
It's a traditional form of tattooing.
They use needles instead of a gun.

12:29.947 --> 12:32.249
Only a couple of places
do that kind of work.

12:32.273 --> 12:34.632
Well,
orange suggests impulsiveness.

12:34.656 --> 12:37.401
The surf racks,
an adventurous nature.

12:38.623 --> 12:41.659
The Jeep is youth
or the pursuit of youth.

12:41.959 --> 12:43.311
The bumper stickers.

12:43.335 --> 12:45.934
Sense of humour,
maybe contempt for authority.

12:45.958 --> 12:48.644
- The tats?
- I could go one of two ways.

12:48.668 --> 12:50.893
To an older generation,
they're a sign of rebellion

12:50.917 --> 12:53.525
and to someone younger,
because they're so ubiquitous,

12:53.549 --> 12:55.097
it might mean conformity.

12:56.474 --> 12:57.909
So basically, you don't have squat.

12:57.933 --> 13:01.493
I'd say it's more of a broad spectrum
of possibilities.

13:01.517 --> 13:04.095
Yeah. That's what they call squat.

13:04.524 --> 13:07.666
There's something else.
A link to L.A.

13:07.690 --> 13:09.995
A really, really good link to L.A.

13:10.019 --> 13:13.541
Flynn's former foster brother
owns a gun shop in the valley.

13:13.565 --> 13:15.449
Chad Ellis.

13:15.952 --> 13:18.490
Thanksgiving must be a hoot.

13:35.263 --> 13:36.982
You looking for someone?

13:37.006 --> 13:40.609
One of my pit stops as a kid
was a couple blocks from here.

13:40.633 --> 13:43.573
Wonder if I'm passing anyone
I used to know.

13:43.597 --> 13:45.823
Not that it matters now.

13:45.847 --> 13:49.143
If it didn't matter, you wouldn't
have brought it up, G.

13:50.194 --> 13:53.374
Oh, my God, he's so hot
Oh, my God, he's so cold.

13:53.398 --> 13:57.440
Oh, my God, I'm so messed up
I don't know which way to go.

13:57.660 --> 13:59.700
Be there in a second.

13:59.996 --> 14:02.048
What was your first like?

14:02.072 --> 14:03.599
We're talking tats, right?

14:03.623 --> 14:04.965
Yeah, we're talking tats.

14:04.989 --> 14:08.762
San Diego, 16, nervous as hell.
Didn't really know what to expect.

14:08.786 --> 14:11.512
Afterwards, I just kind of felt
like a man, you know?

14:11.536 --> 14:13.768
I don't know how else to explain it.

14:13.792 --> 14:15.795
We're talking tats, right?

14:16.512 --> 14:18.090
Yeah.

14:20.641 --> 14:22.184
What can I do for you?

14:24.437 --> 14:25.848
This your work?

14:27.106 --> 14:28.269
Did it about two years ago.

14:28.608 --> 14:29.782
Chick named Cherry.

14:29.806 --> 14:31.502
Does Cherry have a last name?

14:31.526 --> 14:33.663
The world's full of people
with no last name.

14:33.687 --> 14:37.564
Sting, Prince, Brüno.

14:40.411 --> 14:41.442
Cops?

14:42.330 --> 14:45.011
- Would it make a difference?
- I don't have time for this, okay?

14:45.035 --> 14:48.434
She paid in cash. That's all I know.

14:48.458 --> 14:51.582
If you don't mind,
I have a customer waiting.

14:54.342 --> 14:56.524
There can't be many places left.

14:56.548 --> 14:58.130
Nowhere you're ever gonna see.

15:03.226 --> 15:06.156
Why would Chad Ellis' gun store
be closed on a weekday?

15:06.180 --> 15:08.655
Better question is,

15:08.679 --> 15:11.976
why is the door unlocked
if the store's closed?

15:18.866 --> 15:21.536
Careful, Dom.

15:35.216 --> 15:37.268
Lucky escape for the cat.

15:37.292 --> 15:40.255
For Chad, not so much.

15:53.016 --> 15:56.076
I cross-checked the name Cherry
with orange Jeeps through DMV

15:56.100 --> 15:59.365
and I got a hit on a Cherise Dawson.

15:59.389 --> 16:01.200
From there, it was cake.

16:01.224 --> 16:04.542
Opened her electronic belly up
like a pop-up book.

16:04.566 --> 16:06.704
Work and home addresses,

16:06.728 --> 16:09.004
phone numbers and logs,
e-mail address entry.

16:09.028 --> 16:10.835
And we are just getting warmed up.

16:10.859 --> 16:13.417
Guess where she went to high school?
No?

16:13.441 --> 16:15.968
Ridgewell High
in Springfield, Missouri.

16:15.992 --> 16:17.931
Guess who else went there?
Feeling the love?

16:17.955 --> 16:20.057
That's right. Walton Monroe Flynn.

16:20.081 --> 16:22.137
And are you ready for this?

16:22.161 --> 16:23.973
She's one
of your Facebook friends?

16:23.997 --> 16:25.772
Not mine.

16:25.796 --> 16:27.222
Walton Monroe Flynn's.

16:27.246 --> 16:29.750
A few months ago, he friended her.

16:30.053 --> 16:32.864
For you older guys, that's the lingo

16:32.888 --> 16:35.949
for when someone asks you
into their friends list.

16:35.973 --> 16:39.227
What's the lingo for when someone
smacks you with a flip-flop?

16:40.105 --> 16:44.683
Okay, so for a couple weeks,
he played the catch-up game.

16:45.151 --> 16:46.705
You know, nothing revealing.

16:46.729 --> 16:48.919
And then it stopped.

16:48.943 --> 16:50.335
Well, that's not unusual.

16:50.359 --> 16:52.714
After the first blush
of curiosity wanes,

16:52.738 --> 16:55.458
that realisation sets in that
most of these old acquaintances

16:55.482 --> 16:58.473
have nothing in common anymore
and communication ends.

16:58.497 --> 17:01.642
But here is the fly
in the psychological ointment.

17:01.666 --> 17:06.971
A week ago, Flynn contacted her again
and said he was coming to L.A.

17:06.994 --> 17:08.941
Wanted to reconnect in person.

17:08.964 --> 17:11.803
Put Flynn and Cherise up
side by side.

17:19.560 --> 17:21.886
- What are you thinking, G?
- She looks innocent.

17:23.272 --> 17:25.230
No, he's using her.

17:25.650 --> 17:28.900
Might be for money, might be for
a place to crash, but he's using her.

17:29.320 --> 17:31.040
You could be right.

17:31.064 --> 17:32.923
You know,
something's bothering me

17:32.947 --> 17:35.001
about the gun-shop murder.

17:35.025 --> 17:38.119
Coroner said that Chad Ellis
was beaten to death.

17:38.454 --> 17:40.423
There were two pistols missing
from the inventory.

17:40.447 --> 17:42.758
If this is what Flynn wanted,
why not just take them?

17:42.782 --> 17:43.966
Why torture him?

17:43.990 --> 17:46.078
He was an interrogator in Iraq.

17:46.546 --> 17:48.289
He could have gotten a taste for it.

17:48.590 --> 17:49.846
Maybe.

17:49.870 --> 17:52.148
We should keep a quiet read
on our two leads.

17:52.172 --> 17:54.277
See what shakes up.

17:54.301 --> 17:56.510
Would you like her house
or her work?

17:58.683 --> 18:00.782
Now, you're sure
about the census-taking thing?

18:00.806 --> 18:02.910
No, not just census takers, Sam.

18:02.934 --> 18:06.829
Census takers for a community action
organisation for social justice.

18:06.853 --> 18:09.408
Look, Cherise is a tattooed
Venice hippie chick.

18:09.432 --> 18:12.280
She'll practically invite us to move in.

18:26.920 --> 18:28.711
Not home.

18:29.505 --> 18:32.590
Or she is
and she ended up like Chad.

19:01.788 --> 19:03.745
- Clear.
- Clear.

19:06.000 --> 19:08.835
Hm. Ginseng iced tea,

19:09.963 --> 19:13.129
soy milk, veggie burgers,

19:14.467 --> 19:16.923
half a cheese steak sandwich.

19:18.429 --> 19:20.552
Left us a present.

19:46.207 --> 19:47.346
Cherise?

19:47.370 --> 19:49.475
Yeah?

19:49.499 --> 19:52.160
Oh, my God. Is that you?

19:53.369 --> 19:56.003
Regina Sanders. Ridgewell High.

19:56.801 --> 19:58.959
Oh, come on.
I haven't changed that much, have I?

20:00.179 --> 20:03.406
All right, I do have to confess.
I have had a little work done.

20:03.430 --> 20:06.861
But I'm still me. Just a little more
in some places, a little less in others,

20:06.885 --> 20:09.824
depending on what body part
we're talking about.

20:09.848 --> 20:11.576
I'm...

20:11.600 --> 20:13.957
So... You don't remember me,
do you?

20:13.981 --> 20:16.583
- I am sorry.
- No, it's fine. Don't even.

20:16.607 --> 20:19.673
It was a huge high school
and I wasn't exactly "Miss Popularity."

20:19.697 --> 20:22.547
- I have to go to work.
- This is so cool that we met like this.

20:22.571 --> 20:24.546
I have been thinking
about senior year.

20:24.570 --> 20:28.446
Ever since I got an invite on Facebook
from Walton Flynn.

20:29.000 --> 20:30.660
Remember him?

20:31.878 --> 20:33.312
Uh, kind of.

20:33.336 --> 20:36.054
I was his lab partner in chem
for, like, a semester.

20:36.078 --> 20:38.380
Whoever thought
that he would remember me?

20:39.552 --> 20:41.853
I do admit,
I did have a little crush on him.

20:41.877 --> 20:44.782
But then I did have a crush on pretty
much anyone who wore pants.

20:44.806 --> 20:46.279
Except Darlene Coporale.

20:46.303 --> 20:50.070
But that was a different story,
if you know what I mean, right?

20:50.094 --> 20:52.703
So have you spoken to Walton
since graduation?

20:52.727 --> 20:55.413
No. I don't mean to be rude,
but I am late for work, so l...

20:55.437 --> 20:56.866
Oh, absolutely.

20:56.890 --> 21:01.150
Amazing to see you.
Well, okay, bye.

21:08.831 --> 21:09.970
What do you got?

21:09.994 --> 21:13.013
Our girl practically jumped out
of her skin when I mentioned Flynn.

21:13.037 --> 21:14.515
He might have been here.

21:14.539 --> 21:17.262
Eric's checking fingerprints
we pulled off an empty bottle.

21:17.286 --> 21:18.639
What's the plan?

21:18.663 --> 21:21.415
Eric's monitoring the home phone,
cell, Facebook page.

21:21.969 --> 21:24.899
We're about finished wiring the place
and then we just wait and watch.

21:24.923 --> 21:26.272
All right.

21:26.296 --> 21:28.301
Wait and watch.

21:28.976 --> 21:31.016
Wait and watch.

21:57.713 --> 21:58.793
Is that a frog?

21:59.340 --> 22:00.810
It's a swan.

22:00.834 --> 22:02.467
From where? Chernobyl?

22:15.440 --> 22:18.749
- Is that a wing?
- Yeah, it's a wing.

22:18.773 --> 22:21.979
- Why are there three of them?
- There aren't three. That's the tail.

22:23.239 --> 22:24.354
The tail?

22:24.740 --> 22:26.283
Nothing.

22:31.789 --> 22:33.698
I just didn't know
that swans had tails.

22:34.041 --> 22:37.624
Well, they do.
A duck has a tail, right?

22:39.088 --> 22:40.630
Maybe.

22:43.843 --> 22:46.132
Or it could be a duck, then.

22:47.638 --> 22:50.011
Keep it up.
You're gonna have to duck.

22:50.516 --> 22:52.390
I'm just saying.

22:55.771 --> 22:58.097
- What?
- Is everything okay?

22:58.858 --> 22:59.997
Great.

23:00.021 --> 23:01.817
Cherise just pulled into her street.

23:02.195 --> 23:03.274
We got her.

23:18.711 --> 23:20.561
We can take it from here, unless...

23:20.585 --> 23:21.786
Thank you.

23:32.850 --> 23:34.013
Company.

23:39.148 --> 23:42.185
Eric, we've got an SUV behind us.

23:47.031 --> 23:50.756
Three-India-delta-
whisky-six-seven-four.

23:50.780 --> 23:52.066
I got it.

23:52.828 --> 23:54.109
Think that's our man Flynn?

23:54.580 --> 23:57.557
I don't know, but if it is, he's not alone.
There's two of them.

23:57.581 --> 24:02.187
All right, it's a fleet vehicle registered
to our Citdential Security friends.

24:02.211 --> 24:05.522
Didn't Sam make it clear to those guys
this is our investigation?

24:05.546 --> 24:07.602
What do you want me to do?

24:07.626 --> 24:09.344
I got it.

24:18.938 --> 24:20.812
What's she doing?

24:23.985 --> 24:25.942
Oh, we've been made.

24:40.835 --> 24:43.100
You boys need me
to call a tow truck?

24:43.124 --> 24:45.965
- We're good.
- Okay.

24:57.142 --> 24:59.360
And it's another
busy morning on the 101

24:59.384 --> 25:01.161
into downtown Los Angeles.

25:01.185 --> 25:03.561
Traffic is slow and go...

25:05.609 --> 25:06.783
No sign of Flynn.

25:06.807 --> 25:09.666
Not even a phone call.
Cherise was home all night.

25:09.690 --> 25:12.164
So why is this guy here?

25:12.188 --> 25:14.464
We need to be more proactive
than just a stakeout.

25:14.488 --> 25:17.233
- Well, what are you thinking?
- We get close to her at work.

25:17.662 --> 25:19.370
Who's good at video games?

25:19.748 --> 25:23.164
Back in the days,
I was pretty money at "Donkey Kong."

25:24.294 --> 25:26.002
Yeah.

25:26.921 --> 25:28.475
Nate's profile did suggest

25:28.499 --> 25:31.793
that she's attracted to bad-boy types
who need saving.

25:34.304 --> 25:35.383
Did he?

25:38.308 --> 25:42.116
These were on sale at Lucky Brand.

25:42.140 --> 25:48.315
They, uh, already have rips,
so a few more won't matter.

25:49.027 --> 25:54.068
And this is the latest drivel
from what they call the music scene.

25:54.491 --> 25:56.567
I thought we were going all black.

25:56.993 --> 26:02.343
Well, sometimes damaged goods
can actually be more valuable

26:02.367 --> 26:06.075
because of their unique qualities.

26:08.046 --> 26:11.830
- Is that right?
- Mm. It's a thought.

26:15.053 --> 26:17.105
I will try and take good care of them.

26:17.129 --> 26:20.389
Don't try. Just do.

26:22.602 --> 26:24.286
For your UltraSoft interview,

26:24.310 --> 26:26.661
résumé and a little dirty laundry
on the manager.

26:26.685 --> 26:28.730
Should work like a charm.

26:30.485 --> 26:31.955
Well, I'm sorry, Mr. Wells.

26:31.979 --> 26:34.371
We really don't have anything
for you.

26:34.395 --> 26:35.877
You haven't looked at my résumé.

26:35.901 --> 26:38.126
Okay. Well, I'm sure
you're more than qualified.

26:38.150 --> 26:40.793
Let me guess. You've been gaming
since you were a little boy.

26:40.817 --> 26:43.509
Experience in all platforms
and genres.

26:43.533 --> 26:47.158
You have previous employment
in the field. Glowing recommendations.

26:47.711 --> 26:48.885
Am I close?

26:48.909 --> 26:50.285
- Very.
- Yeah.

26:50.797 --> 26:54.106
Well, unfortunately, that's also
the history of the other 22 applicants

26:54.130 --> 26:56.756
on the list ahead of you.
So I'm sorry.

26:57.470 --> 27:00.008
Well, I guess we'll both be sorry.

27:00.432 --> 27:04.381
I'll be out of a job
and you'll be in trouble.

27:04.853 --> 27:09.076
Okay, well, I do like your confidence,
Mr. Wells, and you know what?

27:09.100 --> 27:12.358
I'll even bite. What do you have
that no one else does?

27:13.153 --> 27:15.441
What's under that résumé
you haven't read.

27:28.418 --> 27:30.292
Um... Ahem.

27:30.879 --> 27:32.289
Where did you get this?

27:33.214 --> 27:34.685
Where's not important.

27:34.709 --> 27:40.588
That I won't talk
about your creative tax return is.

27:42.891 --> 27:45.726
- Shall we?
- Yeah.

27:50.231 --> 27:52.639
All right, this is you.

27:53.276 --> 27:56.894
Now, let's see if you're as good
a gamer as you are an extortionist.

28:18.593 --> 28:21.760
Welcome to Warrior Wing.

28:22.555 --> 28:24.762
Make allies now or die.

28:25.266 --> 28:27.733
Possible motive
for the killing in Iraq.

28:27.757 --> 28:30.581
Amini wasn't a fan
of the American military presence

28:30.605 --> 28:32.563
and especially
the private security firms.

28:33.066 --> 28:35.081
He wasn't shy
about letting anyone know it too.

28:35.105 --> 28:36.747
Eric? You there?

28:36.771 --> 28:38.035
You guys, Callen's in trouble.

28:38.059 --> 28:40.040
I got a situation here.

28:40.064 --> 28:42.339
I'm pulling up your computer now.

28:42.363 --> 28:45.618
Bug problems.
Really big bug problems.

28:46.746 --> 28:49.094
All right.
You're up against a devil-droid.

28:49.118 --> 28:51.223
You have to transform yourself
into a dweed.

28:51.247 --> 28:53.659
I already feel like a dweeb
sitting here.

28:54.045 --> 28:55.563
Not a dweeb, a dweed.

28:55.587 --> 28:57.854
It's a combination
between a dwarf and a steed.

28:57.878 --> 29:00.338
All right,
grab your treasure torch and...

29:00.969 --> 29:03.923
Okay. Not good. Not good.

29:05.932 --> 29:07.699
You have used up
17 virtual life-forces.

29:07.723 --> 29:09.055
One more and you die.

29:11.688 --> 29:14.237
Okay, we need to go to plan B, Eric.
Fast.

29:14.261 --> 29:16.184
All right, you got it.

29:16.776 --> 29:19.611
- Do you hear that, Sam?
- On it.

29:37.422 --> 29:39.628
Hello?

29:42.427 --> 29:45.344
Mission accomplished. Lights out.

29:46.514 --> 29:49.277
Listen up, everybody.
It's a building-wide power outage.

29:49.301 --> 29:51.907
Engineering says they're not
gonna have it up anytime soon.

29:51.931 --> 29:54.475
- I guess we get the day off.
- Yeah.

30:08.369 --> 30:10.302
Okay, she's just left the building.

30:10.326 --> 30:11.907
You've got about 20 seconds.

30:12.707 --> 30:16.041
Is that a real 20 seconds,
or 20 seconds give or take?

30:17.378 --> 30:18.873
Uh, more like five now.

30:33.686 --> 30:35.536
Oh, yeah. Great.

30:35.560 --> 30:37.829
I'm trapped under the next car over.

30:37.853 --> 30:40.063
Do I have to do all the heavy lifting
around here?

30:46.362 --> 30:48.157
Sorry.

30:55.041 --> 30:57.662
It sounds like the starter.
Let me take a look.

31:00.755 --> 31:03.791
- Thanks.
- No problem.

31:07.971 --> 31:10.354
Oh, yeah. Your solenoid's fried.

31:10.378 --> 31:11.636
Is that bad?

31:11.975 --> 31:15.260
Well, you could tow it to a mechanic
or I could switch it out tomorrow.

31:15.645 --> 31:18.017
- You can do that?
- I can.

31:18.940 --> 31:20.979
Well, you're a geek and a gear head.

31:21.442 --> 31:24.728
- Yeah, I also cook.
- Nice.

31:25.196 --> 31:27.295
I'll tell you what.
Let me give you a ride home.

31:27.319 --> 31:28.794
- Oh, no.
- Which way you headed?

31:28.818 --> 31:30.984
- You've done enough. I can call a cab.
- No way.

31:31.577 --> 31:33.985
We geeks need to stick together.

31:34.872 --> 31:36.616
I'll grab my bag.

31:38.376 --> 31:40.333
All right.

31:40.837 --> 31:42.093
Sweet.

31:42.117 --> 31:45.143
I'll bet you didn't realise you'd have
to work hard on your first day.

31:45.167 --> 31:46.646
How can I thank you?

31:46.670 --> 31:50.294
That depends on how threatening you
think a bathroom and a beer would be.

31:51.139 --> 31:53.866
Uh, considering my boyfriend's
gonna be home any second,

31:53.890 --> 31:56.490
I don't think I have a lot
to worry about. Yeah.

31:56.514 --> 31:58.228
Sounds good.

32:16.330 --> 32:17.825
In position.

32:19.042 --> 32:20.417
Back lane's covered.

32:20.918 --> 32:23.183
I hope he realises how lucky he is.

32:23.207 --> 32:25.977
Well, we hardly knew each other
in high school.

32:26.001 --> 32:29.340
When we reconnected out here,
it just happened so fast.

32:29.761 --> 32:32.631
I still can't believe it.

32:42.607 --> 32:44.018
Heads up, people.

32:45.193 --> 32:47.019
Our boy's here. Lock and load.

32:47.737 --> 32:50.382
As soon as you say the word, G,
I'm coming through the front door.

32:50.406 --> 32:52.649
He's entering the house.
Stand by, everyone.

32:58.581 --> 33:00.372
Hey, babe.

33:00.708 --> 33:03.164
Hey, baby. Mm.

33:05.338 --> 33:06.808
Oh, Steve works with me.

33:06.832 --> 33:09.354
He gave me a ride home
when my jeep died.

33:09.378 --> 33:12.088
You want me to get you a beer?

33:12.887 --> 33:13.942
It's my first day.

33:13.966 --> 33:16.237
I didn't realise I'd be dealing
with "Talisman Four:

33:16.261 --> 33:18.721
Warlords of the Vesuvian Moon"
and a solenoid.

33:19.018 --> 33:21.474
Yeah.
I never got into the gaming thing.

33:22.146 --> 33:23.533
Yeah, well, it's just...

33:23.557 --> 33:26.459
It's something that kept me away
from dealing with the crap at home

33:26.483 --> 33:27.896
when I was a kid so...

33:28.736 --> 33:31.464
Yeah. Good to meet you.

33:31.488 --> 33:33.233
Thanks.

33:34.909 --> 33:37.115
Army. Don't hate.

33:38.287 --> 33:40.386
Can't hate anyone who's served.

33:40.410 --> 33:43.013
- Iraq?
- Two tours.

33:43.037 --> 33:44.537
That's rough.

33:45.378 --> 33:48.628
Yeah. Not as rough as after.

33:51.050 --> 33:52.758
Come on. What is he waiting for?

33:53.136 --> 33:55.128
Why isn't he giving us
the signal to go in?

34:01.727 --> 34:04.515
Stand by.
We've got some action out here.

34:05.940 --> 34:08.751
G, company. Front door.
Coming in hot and fast.

34:08.775 --> 34:10.817
Dom, maintain your position.

34:11.404 --> 34:13.396
Get down! Flynn!

34:17.909 --> 34:19.867
Stand down! Stand down!

34:21.164 --> 34:22.621
Holster your weapon.

34:23.123 --> 34:24.475
Holster your weapon.

34:24.498 --> 34:25.782
We're okay.

34:46.529 --> 34:48.545
- What was that?
- Collecting our man.

34:48.569 --> 34:50.708
- We were doing our job.
- You were doing our job.

34:50.732 --> 34:53.636
If you'd done your job, we wouldn't
be here cleaning up your mess.

34:53.659 --> 34:56.924
Hey, hey, hey. Look. Look. All right,
we jumped the gun, all right? Our bad.

34:56.947 --> 34:59.258
But he killed one of our own.
You know how that feels.

34:59.282 --> 35:01.842
I know about the rules of engagement
and code of conduct.

35:01.866 --> 35:04.583
Now, get out of here before I forget.

35:11.763 --> 35:13.506
You okay?

35:16.184 --> 35:18.176
You're not a game tester, are you?

35:25.276 --> 35:27.602
Did Flynn say why he came
to see you?

35:29.614 --> 35:32.698
Uh, I wanted to believe
it was because he liked me.

35:33.034 --> 35:34.113
Maybe he does.

35:36.746 --> 35:38.027
It was the SIM card.

35:39.415 --> 35:40.613
He gave you a SIM card?

35:41.292 --> 35:44.708
I downloaded it for him.
It was encrypted.

35:49.092 --> 35:51.191
He tried to pretend
like it wasn't important to him,

35:51.215 --> 35:53.094
but he wanted me to decode it
for him.

35:53.555 --> 35:55.488
I couldn't.
I mean, the card was damaged.

35:55.512 --> 35:59.358
I'm a tester, not a programmer.
What did he expect?

35:59.382 --> 36:02.656
Oh, everything he told me was a lie.

36:02.680 --> 36:04.136
Maybe not everything.

36:09.904 --> 36:11.019
It's him.

36:11.990 --> 36:13.839
- Are you okay?
- Look, I'm sorry, okay?

36:13.863 --> 36:16.524
I'll explain everything later.
Put your friend on.

36:24.252 --> 36:27.063
- Yeah?
- I didn't do what they said I did.

36:27.087 --> 36:28.334
Okay.

36:28.715 --> 36:30.019
Well, why don't we
meet somewhere

36:30.043 --> 36:32.505
and you can tell me
what really happened.

36:33.177 --> 36:34.778
I've got unfinished business.

36:34.802 --> 36:36.928
What kind of business?

36:37.140 --> 36:38.693
I've gotta cut the head off a snake.

36:38.717 --> 36:40.849
Then I'm a ghost.

36:41.102 --> 36:43.675
Tell Cherise... Tell her I'm sorry.

36:45.064 --> 36:46.891
I think you ought to tell her yourself.

36:47.233 --> 36:50.317
You and I both know
it doesn't work that way.

36:54.907 --> 36:56.402
Tell me what?

36:58.786 --> 37:01.277
He told me I'm supposed
to stay away from you.

37:01.748 --> 37:04.155
I guess he really does like you.

37:09.088 --> 37:10.689
This SIM card is pretty messed up.

37:10.713 --> 37:13.728
But it has something to do
with what Citdential is doing in Iraq.

37:13.752 --> 37:15.527
Flynn may have lost it in Baghdad,

37:15.551 --> 37:17.570
but whatever he's doing here
is different.

37:17.594 --> 37:18.926
This is planned.

37:19.474 --> 37:21.799
Enlarge that Citdential logo,
will you?

37:22.894 --> 37:24.436
Bigger.

37:27.315 --> 37:30.043
He's gonna take down Caldwell.
Citdential CEO.

37:30.067 --> 37:32.274
Cutting the head off the snake.

37:33.446 --> 37:35.296
Eric, get me Caldwell's schedule.

37:35.320 --> 37:38.491
And I need to know
what's on that SIM card now.

37:41.996 --> 37:44.677
All right, tonight he's giving a speech

37:44.701 --> 37:47.139
on Middle East security
for a global conference

37:47.163 --> 37:49.718
at the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel
on Hollywood Boulevard.

37:49.742 --> 37:51.272
Oh, it couldn't be more public.

37:51.296 --> 37:53.433
When Caldwell gets out of his car
at the entrance,

37:53.457 --> 37:54.937
he's gonna be completely exposed.

37:54.961 --> 37:56.569
A perfect place to make a hit.

37:56.593 --> 38:01.055
Wait, I got it. The SIM card's a video.

38:05.645 --> 38:07.970
One hell of a video.

38:12.735 --> 38:15.107
Okay, Kensi.
We're outside the Roosevelt.

38:23.371 --> 38:25.055
Here comes Caldwell.

38:25.079 --> 38:26.410
Talk to me, Kensi.

38:26.749 --> 38:29.834
Eric, do we have
any more camera angles?

38:31.045 --> 38:33.512
Wait. I've got him.

38:33.536 --> 38:34.960
Flynn on the move.

38:46.853 --> 38:48.157
Flynn, drop your weapon!

38:48.181 --> 38:50.239
- Stand down!
- Keep your positions!

38:50.263 --> 38:52.931
You know what this is about, Caldwell.

38:57.613 --> 38:59.831
Eric, they need to see
the SIM card video now.

38:59.855 --> 39:02.085
I'm already on it.
There's an electronic billboard

39:02.109 --> 39:05.262
above the club across the street
from Madame Tussauds.

39:05.286 --> 39:08.954
- Can you do it?
- Uh, maybe.

39:10.126 --> 39:11.406
You don't have to do this.

39:11.753 --> 39:14.208
If I'm going down,
that son of a bitch is going with me.

39:15.423 --> 39:17.665
We decoded the SIM card.

39:18.634 --> 39:22.193
Callen, it's on the screen
across the street. Madame Tussauds.

39:22.217 --> 39:26.006
Look behind you.
Look at the screen.

39:30.480 --> 39:32.472
Take him out!

39:45.578 --> 39:47.654
Guess that leaves just you.

39:58.007 --> 40:01.233
The video is from a mini-cam
that was mounted on Flynn's gun.

40:01.257 --> 40:03.562
Kind of like a dashboard cam
in a cop car.

40:03.586 --> 40:07.689
So Caldwell takes Amini out
and sets up Flynn to take the fall.

40:07.713 --> 40:11.367
Then tortures his foster brother
Chad Ellis to death.

40:11.391 --> 40:13.888
Shrinks have a term
for someone like that, doc?

40:14.357 --> 40:15.899
Yeah.

40:16.150 --> 40:17.775
Really screwed up.

40:20.571 --> 40:23.548
DOD will do your intake locally,
then they'll ship you off to D.C.

40:23.572 --> 40:26.386
For protective custody
until the trial's over.

40:26.410 --> 40:28.131
Yeah, right.

40:28.155 --> 40:31.389
And one day we'll both live
in the 'burbs,

40:31.413 --> 40:35.710
barbecue with our neighbours,
and coach Little League.

40:36.796 --> 40:38.623
I don't know.

40:39.423 --> 40:42.353
Teaching your son how
to play baseball sounds pretty idyllic.

40:42.377 --> 40:43.986
Yeah, it does.

40:44.010 --> 40:49.006
But that's why we do what we do,
so others can live those lives.

40:53.271 --> 40:57.079
When Caldwell goes on trial,
if he goes on trial,

40:57.103 --> 41:00.335
I'll do whatever it takes
to keep you from testifying.

41:00.359 --> 41:03.066
Protective custody or not.

41:05.533 --> 41:07.858
The man does have access.

41:09.495 --> 41:11.820
I've got half the Joint Chiefs
on a speed dial.

41:18.754 --> 41:20.213
What are you doing?

42:43.756 --> 42:46.212
Oh, how clever.

42:47.760 --> 42:49.219
A duck.
