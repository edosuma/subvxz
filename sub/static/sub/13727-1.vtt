02:35.639 --> 02:38.315
I was the hero of Hughes Creek. 

02:44.731 --> 02:50.070
I can still see the glint in me
da's eye as he looked down at me...

02:50.154 --> 02:53.439
his hand on me shoulder.

03:09.506 --> 03:15.093
What did he call me that
day? Ah, what did Da call me?

03:21.018 --> 03:25.727
That's right. He called me Sunshine.

03:51.131 --> 03:54.251
You're a pretty girl.

03:55.969 --> 03:59.006
You're Wild Wright's horse, aren't ya?

03:59.098 --> 04:02.680
I know whose ya are. It's all right.

04:02.768 --> 04:06.101
I'll look after ya.

04:33.590 --> 04:39.095
Handsome-looking horse you got there,
Ned. You're cuttin'a flash, all right.

04:44.476 --> 04:47.347
Ah, great.

04:47.438 --> 04:51.482
You're Ned Kelly, aren't
ya? Red Kelly's boy?

04:51.567 --> 04:54.936
Get down, Jane.

04:55.028 --> 04:57.816
Fine animal you got there.

04:57.906 --> 05:03.245
- Distinctive, wouldn't you say?
- She's Wild Wright's.

05:03.328 --> 05:05.654
- That's the postmaster's mare.
- No, it isn't. It's Wild Wright's.

05:05.748 --> 05:08.285
- He lost her when she bolted into the bushes.
- You're a liar, Kelly.

05:08.375 --> 05:11.578
- No, I'm not. I found her this morning, grazing.
- She's been reported stolen.

05:11.670 --> 05:14.457
- Stolen, me arse!
- A horse thief!

05:14.548 --> 05:18.795
- Get your hands off me!
- You're under arrest.

05:21.722 --> 05:25.554
Stand, Kelly, or I swear
to God, I'll shoot you down.

05:25.642 --> 05:28.513
- I was only going after the horse.
- You were trying to escape.

05:28.604 --> 05:32.103
You're just as thick
as your bloody father.

05:36.236 --> 05:39.107
Jesus Christ! Now, what are you trying to
do? I could've tanned your hide for that.

05:39.198 --> 05:44.239
- Strike an officer, and you'll bloody swing for it!
- Strike you down to the ground!

05:44.328 --> 05:46.616
- No blows struck yet, Constable Hall!
- Help me, someone!

05:46.705 --> 05:50.454
Help him! Help Constable
Hall! Poor Constable Hall!

05:50.542 --> 05:53.294
- He's such a fuckin' rat!
- He's trying to kill me, the rascally blackguard!

05:53.378 --> 05:59.499
- Help me, someone! Stand
put! Go on! Put me down!

05:59.593 --> 06:03.721
He tried to shoot me, for Christ's
sake! All right! All right!

06:07.684 --> 06:11.100
Is that the best you can
do, you bloody coward?

06:11.188 --> 06:16.609
Go on. I can take it.

06:16.693 --> 06:19.778
That's enough!

06:46.974 --> 06:50.806
Hello there! Please, can you help me?

06:50.894 --> 06:55.722
Hello! Hello there! Please!
Slow it down, please!

06:55.816 --> 06:59.979
Come on! Come on! Please!

07:00.070 --> 07:05.527
Please, now! Oh, come on!
Give us a ride, you bastards!

07:07.119 --> 07:10.702
Christ, it's muddy enough to bog a dog.

07:10.789 --> 07:14.834
- So, where'd you go after Beechworth?
- May Day Hills on a road gang.

07:14.918 --> 07:17.836
Ah, you see Sean Gallagher?
I heard he was up there.

07:17.921 --> 07:21.586
Yeah. I saw him for a while.

07:21.675 --> 07:27.180
Hey. I think that's old man Wicks
and... What's his daughter called?

07:27.264 --> 07:29.672
- Sarah.
- Sarah. That's right. She's a picture.

07:29.767 --> 07:33.218
Oh, we could be in love, boys.

07:34.980 --> 07:38.930
Mr Wicks, good mornin'.

07:39.026 --> 07:43.771
Mr Wicks, I don't know if you remember
me. I'm Aaron Sherritt, Mr Wicks.

07:43.864 --> 07:47.150
- If you could just hold up for one moment...
- If anyone can persuade...

07:47.242 --> 07:50.943
an old man to share his daughter with
three larrikins like us, it'll be hard.

07:51.038 --> 07:53.955
So how's me ma?

07:54.041 --> 07:57.706
- What?
- Ah, the coppers have been giving her a hard time, Ned.

07:57.795 --> 08:00.250
Something goes missin',
a bullock or anything...

08:00.339 --> 08:05.464
they come round the middle of the night, tear
the place apart, scarin' the kiddies and all.

08:06.804 --> 08:10.219
- She's had it hard.
- Come on, lads!

08:10.307 --> 08:14.221
- Jump up!
- Well, will you look at that.

08:14.311 --> 08:16.600
What did I tell ya?

08:18.315 --> 08:21.020
- Thank you very much, sir.
- Thanks a lot, Mr Wicks.

08:21.110 --> 08:24.728
Thank you, Mr Wicks.

08:32.538 --> 08:35.159
Dan!

08:39.086 --> 08:42.833
Ma, there's someone coming.

08:49.430 --> 08:51.885
Oh, God. It's Ned.

08:53.142 --> 08:55.549
Neddy!

08:58.605 --> 09:01.476
Mommy, I named Hobson's kookaburra.

09:01.567 --> 09:04.651
- What did you name him, darlin'?
- Beefy, 'cause he likes beef.

09:04.736 --> 09:08.105
- Well, that's a fine name for a kookaburra, Grace.
- Who's the proud father, Ma?

09:08.198 --> 09:12.326
Don't even ask. He's a long time
gone. That's all there is to it.

09:12.411 --> 09:15.163
- The stinkin' Proddy.
- He was a Yank.

09:15.247 --> 09:17.999
George the baker. We were
married, Ned, right and proper.

09:18.083 --> 09:21.333
- Well, that's grand, Ma.

09:21.420 --> 09:23.875
- Christ! Will you stop messin'?
I'm sick of the pair of ya.

09:23.964 --> 09:27.084
Give your mother some respect, or I'll
give ya a hidin', both of youse, ya hear me?

09:27.176 --> 09:29.548
- And who are you, anyways?
- Steve Hart.

09:29.636 --> 09:31.795
Well, seein' as how the two
of you are so full of beans...

09:31.889 --> 09:34.806
you can both get off your asses
and help me fix up this place.

09:34.892 --> 09:38.058
- You haven't done a minute's work to help your ma, have you?
- Come on, everyone.

09:38.145 --> 09:41.561
- Sit down, now. What
kind of stew is it?

09:41.648 --> 09:44.852
Wombat. A wombat's a marsupial,
and it lives in a hole.

09:44.943 --> 09:48.644
I know, darlin; I put one in the stew.

09:48.739 --> 09:53.282
Shh. Da-da-da.
La-la-la.

09:53.368 --> 09:56.369
Ned, would you like to say the grace?

09:56.455 --> 09:58.862
All right.

10:02.544 --> 10:05.711
Dear Lord, thank you for
looking after me mother...

10:05.798 --> 10:10.756
me sister Grace, me sister
Kate and me brother Dan.

10:12.846 --> 10:17.093
- Thank you, Lord, for our beautiful baby Ellen...
- Shh, shh, shh.

10:17.184 --> 10:19.936
And for this wonderful
stew made out of wombat.

10:20.020 --> 10:22.226
- Amen.
- Amen.

10:22.314 --> 10:24.556
Amen.

11:09.611 --> 11:12.696
It's not easy for an Irishman
in Queen Victoria's colony...

11:12.781 --> 11:15.901
to walk the straight and narrow...

11:15.993 --> 11:18.947
but I toed the line...

11:19.037 --> 11:21.445
despite all temptations.

11:28.005 --> 11:32.299
- With me fighting
with my fists for money.

11:37.931 --> 11:41.715
And after all, I did three
years for that stolen horse.

11:41.810 --> 11:46.971
Wild Wright only got 18 months. You
think I was gonna let that one slide?

11:51.904 --> 11:56.696
I declare Ned the winner!

11:56.784 --> 12:01.778
Bets are in.

12:08.629 --> 12:11.713
So, are we square?

12:11.799 --> 12:15.796
Course we are, you
mad bugger. Come here!

12:15.886 --> 12:18.638
Thank Christ for that!

12:25.062 --> 12:28.976
Could it be possible that the
Kellys were finally getting ahead?

12:30.275 --> 12:34.487
That I could actually better meself?

12:41.787 --> 12:45.571
Steady.

12:47.126 --> 12:49.118
Excuse me. You there.

12:49.211 --> 12:54.632
- Would you mind coming and holding my horse's thing?
- All right.

12:56.093 --> 12:58.251
Steady.

12:58.345 --> 13:01.714
- Now, what thing are
you talkin' about, ma'am?

13:01.807 --> 13:05.555
Are you gonna help me or not?

13:05.644 --> 13:08.645
I've been riding him pretty
hard the last two days.

13:08.730 --> 13:13.855
Poor thing's been holding on since Saturday.
His bladder's paralyzed with the colic.

13:13.944 --> 13:16.696
- Good God.
- Have you got that?

13:16.780 --> 13:21.526
- Right there. Good. Good.
- Just hold it there.

13:21.618 --> 13:25.663
Keep still.

13:25.747 --> 13:30.244
- I'm glad that's not me. Christ.

13:30.335 --> 13:35.626
- Steady.
- Whoa, boy. Whoa, boy.

13:35.716 --> 13:38.800
Okay. All right.

13:38.886 --> 13:43.014
Watch your boots, boys! Whoo!

13:43.098 --> 13:47.345
- It looks like you've done this kind of thing before.
- Only on horses.

13:47.436 --> 13:50.805
Thank God for that.

13:53.358 --> 13:56.359
My name's Ned Kelly. Pleased to meet ya.

13:56.445 --> 14:00.229
- Hello, Ned.
- Right.

14:11.418 --> 14:15.665
- Watch out, lads! Here he
goes again! Clear the way!

14:20.511 --> 14:23.512
The horse is too wild.
It can't be broken.

14:23.597 --> 14:27.547
A waste of damn money.
Fetch my rifle, please.

14:27.643 --> 14:31.687
What? You can't just shoot
a horse 'cause it's wild.

14:31.772 --> 14:37.644
- What else can we do? We can't keep it here.
- Why don't you set it free?

14:37.736 --> 14:42.149
I could break that horse
for you if you like.

14:45.202 --> 14:48.950
I've broken horses before. You can ask
around. I'd like to give it a try, at least.

14:53.210 --> 14:56.579
- We know there's not much point.

14:56.672 --> 14:59.792
The horse is bad.

16:13.999 --> 16:18.460
You know, the Chinese say you should have
only one true love in your entire life...

16:18.545 --> 16:22.495
otherwise you are no better than
a mangy dog or a loose woman.

16:22.591 --> 16:24.754
- What did he say? Good
thing I'm not Chinese.

16:24.789 --> 16:26.918
-
- What did he say?

16:27.012 --> 16:32.089
He said what a lucky fellow I am
to be with such a beauty as you.

16:32.184 --> 16:34.473
Too lucky, if you ask me.

17:20.022 --> 17:23.891
Oh, hello, Kate. I didn't see you there.

17:23.986 --> 17:27.651
- Fancy seeing you here.
- I'm just having a swift pint after work.

17:27.739 --> 17:33.161
It's not like I'm a regular or anything. A
man needs to relax after a hard day's work.

17:33.245 --> 17:36.246
What would you know
about a hard day's work?

17:36.331 --> 17:40.543
Sleeping and drinking and beatin' up
yellow fellows is all you ever seem to do.

17:40.627 --> 17:44.755
That's not fair, now.
I'm only doing me job.

17:44.840 --> 17:48.423
I get along with everybody.
Everybody gets along with me.

17:59.563 --> 18:04.902
- Can I buy you a drink?
- No, thank you. I have money.

18:04.985 --> 18:07.274
- I just wanna buy you a drink.
- I said I don't want one.

18:07.362 --> 18:10.648
You're startin' to get on me nerves now.

18:10.741 --> 18:14.952
Think you're too good
for me? Is that it?

18:15.037 --> 18:19.533
- Who do you think you are?
- Let go of me bloody arm. You're hurtin' me.

18:19.625 --> 18:23.919
- Let go of her arm, you.
- I'm just bein' friendly, Ned.

18:24.004 --> 18:26.542
Just offering the young lady a drink.

18:26.632 --> 18:32.337
- She doesn't want one from the likes of you.
- A problem there, Fitzpatrick?

18:32.429 --> 18:38.349
No. There's no problem here, Constable.

18:38.435 --> 18:44.355
I'm sorry if I upset you... Kate.

18:44.441 --> 18:49.068
Right. This one's a
request from Ned Kelly.

18:50.864 --> 18:54.779
Right. Follow me, lads. One, two.

19:06.004 --> 19:11.509
The nerve of the bloody knacker. Look
at him. Acts as if he owns the place.

19:11.593 --> 19:17.513
Come here and dance with
your sister! Come on!

19:17.599 --> 19:22.510
- That fella needs taking down
a peg or two, that's for sure.

19:46.378 --> 19:51.289
- Ned, the horses are gone.
- What?

20:08.442 --> 20:12.392
The biggest thieves and
liars the sun ever shone on.

20:12.488 --> 20:16.735
The Victorian police.

20:20.120 --> 20:22.825
Well, I'm telling you
something now, boys.

20:22.915 --> 20:26.747
I'm not gonna let these bloody
maggots put one over on me.

21:39.575 --> 21:43.987
To change a horse's brand is
easy, easier than you'd think.

21:46.331 --> 21:50.709
You just pluck the little hairs
and prick the skin with iodine.

21:50.794 --> 21:55.503
A "C"or an "O" can become a "Q. "

21:55.591 --> 21:59.209
"Q"for "Quinn"... me
mother's maiden name.

22:17.988 --> 22:20.693
Who's that at this hour of the night?

22:33.629 --> 22:37.626
- Dan, is Kate in?
- Yeah, she is.

22:37.716 --> 22:43.221
Well, would you mind telling her I'd
like a word, please? In private, like.

22:43.305 --> 22:46.970
No, I won't. She wants nothing to
do with you. You know that full well.

22:47.059 --> 22:50.179
Well, I'd like to hear that
from her, if you don't mind.

22:50.270 --> 22:54.350
Fitzpatrick, you've already heard
that from her many's the time.

22:54.441 --> 22:57.561
Will you do yourself a
favour. Take a ride home.

22:57.653 --> 23:00.488
- You think you're so smart.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

23:00.572 --> 23:04.440
- I've a warrant for you.
- You've no warrant, you fool.

23:04.535 --> 23:08.200
A Kelly stole them horses. I know
it was, and I have a warrant for you.

23:08.288 --> 23:10.364
Ned and all. I've
warrants for both of ya.

23:10.457 --> 23:13.743
I don't suppose I could
see them warrants, could I?

23:19.508 --> 23:23.885
There's your warrants.
Hmm? There's your warrants.

23:33.105 --> 23:35.560
Oh, hello.

23:35.649 --> 23:39.350
I just came down to
find my riding jacket.

23:39.445 --> 23:43.394
I thought I left it here somewhere.

23:43.490 --> 23:46.361
I haven't seen it.

23:46.452 --> 23:50.034
I was sure it was here.

23:50.122 --> 23:55.578
If I find it, I'll be sure to
bring it up to the house for ya.

23:55.669 --> 23:58.540
- All right then.
- Right.

23:58.630 --> 24:02.675
- You're from England?
- Yes.

24:02.759 --> 24:05.879
Surrey, actually. You're Irish?

24:05.971 --> 24:10.099
Yeah. Me da was from Tipperary, but I
was born here. I've never been to Ireland.

24:10.184 --> 24:13.683
I came over when I was 17.

24:13.771 --> 24:16.440
Richard acquired the land
through his family, and...

24:16.523 --> 24:20.023
My da had to go to all the trouble of
stealing a sheep to get the trip over here.

24:20.110 --> 24:24.060
He got a free fare then. He was lucky.

24:24.156 --> 24:26.481
Yeah.

24:37.836 --> 24:43.293
- How are you tonight?
- Fine. Till you showed up.

24:43.383 --> 24:46.966
Drink, boys?

24:50.808 --> 24:55.268
- Steve?
- I don't drink with coppers.

24:57.189 --> 25:01.317
Aye. There's no need for that.

25:06.490 --> 25:10.238
So I'm leaving here tomorrow. The
work here for me is finished now.

25:10.327 --> 25:12.818
Yes. I know.

25:14.123 --> 25:17.622
So I won't be seeing you any more.

25:20.003 --> 25:22.329
You sure you don't want to have a
better look for that riding jacket?

25:31.098 --> 25:36.638
No. I... I must have left
it in the house somewhere.

25:38.522 --> 25:41.772
Well, it was nice to have met you.

26:04.298 --> 26:06.836
I really should go.

26:09.720 --> 26:12.970
I think you're the most
beautiful woman I've ever seen.

26:16.185 --> 26:21.345
- You don't have any warrants at all, do you?
- Oh, I do, Mrs Kelly. I do.

26:21.440 --> 26:25.188
I don't believe this. You
just plain thick or what?

26:25.277 --> 26:28.112
Come on, Kate. I'm just
having a bit of fun, you know.

26:32.409 --> 26:35.446
Now, let's see those bloody warrants.

27:18.539 --> 27:21.824
I've split me head open! You bastards!

27:21.917 --> 27:24.669
- It's your hand, you bloody idiot.
- Hey, Fitzpatrick.

27:24.753 --> 27:27.588
- Bottom rung on top now, huh?
- Shoot him.

27:27.673 --> 27:30.508
- Don't, Dan.
- Give him back his bloody gun.

27:37.558 --> 27:40.512
Go on! Get!

27:41.770 --> 27:44.724
I'll be back for ya, ya bastards.

28:20.976 --> 28:24.096
Can you believe the
brass neck on that idiot?

28:24.188 --> 28:27.023
Trying to be all friendly with the grog.

28:27.107 --> 28:29.230
Yeah. He seemed sobered up
when you pointed the gun at him.

28:29.318 --> 28:33.315
- See his face?
- I'm glad you think this is all very funny.

28:35.532 --> 28:39.744
- Where have you been?
Never mind where I've been.

28:43.165 --> 28:46.082
- What's happened?
- Fitzpatrick couldn't hold his brandy and lemonade.

28:46.168 --> 28:49.335
- What are you talking about?
- We had a fight with Fitzpatrick.

28:49.421 --> 28:52.173
- A fight? Why?
- He said he had warrants for me and you.

28:52.257 --> 28:55.792
- What warrants?
- Horse stealing, but there was a load of shite in it.

28:55.886 --> 28:59.469
- Whether it was or wasn't, there's trouble now either way.
- You can't take that seriously.

28:59.556 --> 29:04.432
How can you stand there and act like this
is one big joke, after all the trouble...

29:04.520 --> 29:07.723
we've had with coppers in this family?

29:10.234 --> 29:15.359
- What are you thinking, Joe?
- You and Dan oughta clear out for a day or two...

29:15.447 --> 29:17.938
just to be safe.

29:18.033 --> 29:21.616
God willing, it'll all blow over.

29:42.432 --> 29:45.469
What the hell happened to you?

29:48.397 --> 29:52.726
- Ned Kelly shot me.
- He what?

29:52.818 --> 29:57.480
- Take your rotten hands
off me, you bastard!

29:57.573 --> 30:01.820
- Get off her!
- You're under arrest! I'm taking you to the cells!

30:01.910 --> 30:04.448
You filthy bastards!

30:06.790 --> 30:10.040
Ned! Ned!

30:20.846 --> 30:25.259
- Ned. Jesus, Ned, they've arrested Ma.
- They what?

30:25.350 --> 30:28.435
Yeah. They've taken her to the cells,
charged her with attempted murder.

30:28.520 --> 30:32.185
- Attempted murder?
- And Fitzpatrick's saying you took a shot at him.

30:32.274 --> 30:35.809
- I wasn't even there.
- We know that, but it's your word against his.

30:35.903 --> 30:39.069
Take the word of a drunken liar
and arrest an innocent woman?

30:39.156 --> 30:42.489
Is that right?

30:42.576 --> 30:45.530
I won't take this injustice!
I'm gonna kill him!

30:45.621 --> 30:48.028
I swear I'll scatter his
blood and brains like rain!

30:48.123 --> 30:50.910
- Ned! Ned! No!
- Stand aside!

30:51.001 --> 30:53.409
- No, Ned! Don't make this worse for Ma!
- Stop it, Ned!

31:06.433 --> 31:09.683
Take the children inside, please.

31:18.737 --> 31:22.106
- What are you doing here?
- They arrested me ma.

31:22.199 --> 31:25.069
- What for?
- The copper says I tried to kill him.

31:25.160 --> 31:27.532
Why?

31:27.621 --> 31:32.449
'Cause he's a bastard liar,
like all coppers. That's why.

31:32.543 --> 31:36.375
The thing is, I wasn't even there.

31:37.756 --> 31:41.172
I was here with you.

31:41.260 --> 31:45.304
You could tell the truth, show the
swine up for the drunken liar he is.

31:45.389 --> 31:50.134
- And then they'd have to release me ma.
- That's impossible.

31:50.227 --> 31:54.390
I couldn't. Do you realize
what that would mean?

31:54.481 --> 31:57.055
Yes.

32:00.612 --> 32:05.073
I can't. I'd be disgraced.

32:09.371 --> 32:12.954
He'd take away my children, and...

32:23.635 --> 32:27.170
It's all right. I understand.

32:29.183 --> 32:34.390
- Ned.
- Go ahead. Go ahead.

32:38.901 --> 32:41.107
Right.

33:39.294 --> 33:42.212
I made them an offer at the outset:

33:42.297 --> 33:44.788
Charge me and let me mother go.

33:44.883 --> 33:49.794
The answer came back: "We
don't bargain with outlaws.

33:49.888 --> 33:52.379
We'll catch you anyway. "

34:10.409 --> 34:13.493
You see those stretchers?
You know what they're for?

34:13.579 --> 34:17.527
The bastards ain't plannin' on
takin' prisoners, that's for sure.

34:20.918 --> 34:24.253
There's another party down
past the neck of Bullock Creek.

34:24.339 --> 34:29.333
Four of'em. They've hemmed us in on
either side, whether they know it or not.

34:29.428 --> 34:35.347
We'll come back at dawn, hold up
these two, take their guns and horses.

34:35.434 --> 34:38.268
At least then we'll have a
chance of making a run for it.

34:38.353 --> 34:40.476
Right.

35:53.011 --> 35:55.253
Drop your arms!

36:23.584 --> 36:25.956
Christ, it's Lonigan, Ned.

36:27.629 --> 36:31.045
You've killed Lonigan.

36:44.104 --> 36:46.773
Do you want marmalade, Ned?

36:56.200 --> 36:59.485
Are you gonna kill me or what?

37:03.123 --> 37:07.037
I'll leave the force first thing tomorrow
morning. I swear it on me mother's life.

37:13.467 --> 37:15.922
Ned.

37:21.600 --> 37:23.972
- Jesus Christ.
- Do as I said, and no one will get shot.

37:45.332 --> 37:47.905
Sergeant, you'd better
surrender. You're surrounded.

37:50.879 --> 37:56.336
You been into the whisky
again, you old sod?

37:56.426 --> 38:00.673
- Get some toast on, Lonigan. Lonigan's
gone, and you two'll be next...

38:00.764 --> 38:04.216
- If you don't get
off them damn horses.

38:31.044 --> 38:34.710
Oh, Christ!

38:45.350 --> 38:49.847
- Give it up, man! It's over!

38:49.938 --> 38:53.307
Will you stop running? I
won't shoot you. I swear.

39:12.503 --> 39:16.880
- Why didn't you surrender?
I wouldn't have shot ya.

39:16.965 --> 39:19.966
I can't breathe!

39:20.052 --> 39:24.429
- No! I can't breathe!
- Right, right, right.

39:24.515 --> 39:28.347
Listen. It's okay.

39:30.187 --> 39:32.345
I can't breathe.

39:32.439 --> 39:35.773
- One minute. One minute. One minute.

39:35.859 --> 39:39.275
- It's all right. It's all right.
- Oh!

39:44.034 --> 39:48.862
- Why did you have to run?
I wouldn't have shot ya.

39:48.956 --> 39:54.330
God damn. Look. No.

39:54.419 --> 39:57.337
- I don't wanna die like this.
- No. No. I'm sorry I shot you.

39:57.422 --> 40:03.377
I don't wanna... I got
a wife and two children.

40:03.470 --> 40:08.595
What are they gonna do without me?
What are they gonna do without...

40:08.684 --> 40:13.180
- No!
- Look at me. Look at me.

40:13.272 --> 40:16.522
God forgive me!

40:39.465 --> 40:42.715
God forgive me.

41:21.173 --> 41:24.008
I don't know why I took his watch.

41:24.092 --> 41:28.042
It was something to do
with him not needing it.

41:31.850 --> 41:35.682
Later, I thought about
sending it to his family.

41:38.148 --> 41:42.894
But by then, the papers had me
down as some sort of monster...

41:45.614 --> 41:50.110
so I thought, "No point now.

41:50.202 --> 41:53.571
I'm damned anyway. "

42:06.051 --> 42:09.385
Is it true what they've been
saying about the three coppers?

42:09.471 --> 42:11.630
Yeah, it's true.

42:11.723 --> 42:14.049
Oh, God.

42:15.519 --> 42:18.888
It was a fair fight, Ma.

42:18.981 --> 42:22.480
Better them than Ned.

42:22.568 --> 42:26.316
They'll kill him now.

42:26.405 --> 42:29.738
They'll kill him for sure.

42:57.978 --> 43:01.098
Don't shoot, lad. I'm unarmed.

43:01.190 --> 43:04.190
Come on. Put that away.
There aren't any troops.

43:04.276 --> 43:08.570
Aw.

43:08.655 --> 43:12.439
- You're bloody chirpy for this hour of the morning.
- Gotta keep your voice down.

43:12.534 --> 43:14.657
- I've a visitor.
- Who?

43:14.745 --> 43:17.366
- Mary Hegarty.
- Mary Hegarty!

43:17.456 --> 43:20.161
- Mm.
- Jesus. She can be only 13.

43:20.250 --> 43:25.245
I'm not superstitious.
Well, well, well, well, well.

43:25.339 --> 43:30.879
I've never met a man whose lies are worth
Â2,000 before, especially not Irishmen.

43:30.969 --> 43:36.046
- It's Â6,000. Is
that what it's up to?

43:36.141 --> 43:38.264
My cock alone's worth more than that.

43:38.352 --> 43:40.510
I could do with the money meself.

43:40.604 --> 43:43.688
I'd build a shed out the
back, buy a few horses.

43:43.774 --> 43:47.190
In fact, I could buy half
of Beechworth with all that.

43:47.277 --> 43:51.986
- That's very funny, Aaron.
- Clause two.

43:55.953 --> 44:00.247
They've recalled parliament.

44:00.332 --> 44:04.081
Passed something called "The
Felons Apprehension Act. "

44:06.421 --> 44:10.170
It means we're listed as outlaws.

44:10.259 --> 44:14.208
We can be shot on sight
by anyone who chooses.

44:27.025 --> 44:30.857
They said I'd lost what
it meant to be human.

44:30.946 --> 44:33.318
Maybe I never had it in the first place.

44:33.407 --> 44:39.196
- But wasn't this about
protecting the ones I loved...

44:39.288 --> 44:43.237
the ones who gave me food and
shelter, even the clothes on me back.

44:46.545 --> 44:50.210
And therefore, wasn't it now a war?

44:51.758 --> 44:57.548
Dan, you see that wooden gate?

44:57.639 --> 45:00.676
Around the back there
is their living quarters.

45:00.767 --> 45:03.934
If anyone's there, you keep 'em there.

45:54.279 --> 45:57.483
- Can I help you?
- Yes, you can. Me name's Edward Kelly.

45:57.574 --> 46:02.367
- His mates call him Ned.
- Ned Kelly?

46:02.454 --> 46:06.499
- I'm sure I've heard that name somewhere bef...
- I'm sure you have, sir.

46:10.295 --> 46:13.047
Stay where you are.

46:13.131 --> 46:17.295
What do you think you're
doing? Who are you?

46:17.386 --> 46:21.170
Going to a funeral, eh? Better
do as I say, or it'll be your own.

46:21.265 --> 46:24.384
- Ma.
- Shh.

46:24.476 --> 46:27.181
- Fanny Shaw, what are you doing here?
- I work here.

46:27.271 --> 46:30.355
- I can't believe it. What
are you doing here, Steve?

46:30.440 --> 46:36.313
We're robbing the bank. Me and
Fanny used to go to school together.

46:39.992 --> 46:42.993
Steve. Hello, kiddies.

46:46.874 --> 46:50.492
- You're Ned Kelly.
- That's right.

46:50.586 --> 46:53.159
What are you going to do with us?

46:53.255 --> 46:55.294
You're coming with us to Faithfulls
Creek. We can't leave anyone behind...

46:55.382 --> 46:57.458
to raise the alarm, now, can we?

46:57.551 --> 47:01.299
Mr Kelly, we are supposed to
be attending a funeral today.

47:01.388 --> 47:04.175
As you can see, I'm
dressed in mourning wear.

47:07.519 --> 47:11.932
Obviously unsuitable for a woman travelling
in the countryside, hostage or not.

47:12.024 --> 47:14.775
- Even a blackguard like yourself...
- Susan!

47:14.860 --> 47:16.899
I do apologize for my wife's behaviour.

47:16.987 --> 47:19.063
There is no need to apologize
on my account, Charles.

47:19.156 --> 47:22.406
The man is wearing a magenta
cravat, for God's sake.

47:24.161 --> 47:28.111
I have an outfit just
arrived from Melbourne.

47:28.207 --> 47:30.579
L'eau du Nil silk.

47:30.667 --> 47:34.202
Well, you'd better
put it on then. Go on.

47:40.552 --> 47:45.095
Joe, you should follow her, make sure she
doesn't signal from the windows with her bloomers.

47:52.815 --> 47:56.729
- How dare you! Sure.
I'm doing no harm.

48:01.824 --> 48:05.572
What are these, these skulls?

48:05.661 --> 48:09.493
- I collect them.
- Hello.

48:11.416 --> 48:15.082
So you're Joe Byrne?

48:15.170 --> 48:19.038
The papers say you have the facial
features of a creature born to crime.

48:19.132 --> 48:21.920
I'm the handsome one in the bunch.

48:22.010 --> 48:26.968
They also said you married a Spanish housemaid
in Diniliquin with the exotic name of Madela.

48:27.057 --> 48:30.426
We were just good friends.

48:30.519 --> 48:34.682
Mm. I suppose you have
a lot of good friends.

48:39.862 --> 48:43.147
I'm sure there's no
harm in being friendly.

48:44.950 --> 48:50.537
No, I don't suppose there is.

48:52.249 --> 48:55.369
Oh, you're a beast...

48:55.460 --> 48:59.672
an absolute beast.

49:03.844 --> 49:07.177
She's taking an awfully long time.

49:07.264 --> 49:10.348
He just fell off the other
side right into a puddle.

49:10.434 --> 49:12.557
- You'll never guess who I ran into last week.
- Who?

49:12.644 --> 49:17.639
Danny O'Reilly. He's working on the new
rail line. He's got a wife and three kids.

49:17.733 --> 49:21.777
Sure. That's grand. I haven't
seen him in at least three years.

49:21.862 --> 49:26.323
- That's like one kid every year.

49:26.408 --> 49:30.737
Hey, Ned. Look at this.

49:30.829 --> 49:36.168
Mortgages. One of'em's
for old man Wick's place.

49:36.251 --> 49:39.834
- I recognize a couple of the others too.
- They're of no use to you.

49:39.922 --> 49:43.670
They're the only records I have of the
bank's debtors. Can I have them back, please?

49:43.759 --> 49:46.629
No.

49:55.771 --> 49:59.104
So I killed their policeman,
and I robbed their bank...

49:59.191 --> 50:03.438
but burning their mortgages... well,
that was destroying Crown property.

50:03.529 --> 50:08.950
It was like slappin' Queen
Victoria herself across the face.

50:09.034 --> 50:13.198
So they send in Hare,
Superintendent Francis Hare...

50:13.288 --> 50:17.535
late of Cape Town, South Africa.

50:17.626 --> 50:21.410
And wasn't this the challenge of
your whole life, Superintendent?

50:21.505 --> 50:24.755
A feather in your cap.
You can't catch me.

50:24.842 --> 50:29.302
You don't have a hope of catching
me, so you take my friends instead.

50:29.388 --> 50:33.516
Over a hundred men arrested, stuck
in stinkin'cells without trial...

50:33.600 --> 50:37.764
while their crops perish in the fields.

50:44.736 --> 50:50.691
And guess what. Not one of'em caves
in and tries to claim the reward...

50:50.784 --> 50:52.824
not one of'em.

50:52.911 --> 50:56.114
They loved mejust the same and
hated you all the more, didn't they?

50:56.206 --> 51:00.702
- Did you really think I
was gonna let 'em all rot?

51:05.340 --> 51:09.670
Two and a half thousand pounds. There's enough
to pay rent on the leaseholds for lads in jail.

51:09.761 --> 51:12.679
Thomas, you can take what you need for
your mother to pay off her debt to McTeague.

51:12.764 --> 51:15.849
- Thanks, Ned.
- And there's some for McKinleys and Bill Skilling...

51:15.934 --> 51:19.350
whatever he needs for his da.

51:19.438 --> 51:22.807
Have you heard anything about me ma?

51:22.900 --> 51:28.819
They set a trial at the end of last month.
She's been given three years hard labour.

51:28.906 --> 51:32.156
I'm sorry, Ned.

51:37.164 --> 51:40.367
I say, give me that back.

51:40.459 --> 51:43.032
That blackguard just stole my watch.

51:43.128 --> 51:47.173
- They say the Lord helps those who help themselves.
- Give him back his watch.

51:47.257 --> 51:53.130
- What?
- You heard what I said. I said, give him back his damn watch.

51:53.222 --> 51:57.515
Have you gone simple all of a
sudden? We're robbing the bank.

51:57.601 --> 52:02.097
Listen here, kid. This is the last time
I tell ya... Give him back his damn watch.

52:10.239 --> 52:14.106
You're not innocent men. You're
a bunch of common criminals.

52:14.201 --> 52:18.662
Did you hear that? If we act like common
thieves, that's just what they'll call us.

52:32.427 --> 52:37.089
My mother is rotting
away in a prison cell...

52:37.182 --> 52:42.639
because of the lies of a
policeman named Fitzpatrick.

52:42.729 --> 52:46.976
She's an innocent woman,
and so are these boys here.

52:47.067 --> 52:51.065
My Irish brethren have been
unlawfully imprisoned...

52:51.155 --> 52:55.069
and blacklisted from their selections.

52:55.159 --> 53:01.279
How do you expect me to behave other
than to stand up against this treatment?

53:03.625 --> 53:09.046
Any one of you here can take a shot
at me and not be charged for it.

53:09.131 --> 53:12.381
There's me gun.

53:13.886 --> 53:16.424
Any of you feeling
brave enough, go ahead.

53:17.681 --> 53:19.757
No?

53:21.226 --> 53:23.515
That's what I thought.

53:26.857 --> 53:29.811
So if I can beg your patience,
this is my statement...

53:29.902 --> 53:33.946
to the Premier of
Victoria, Graham Berry...

53:34.031 --> 53:36.023
and you here are my witnesses.

53:36.116 --> 53:39.781
Joe, take out a pen and paper.
We'll write ourselves a letter.

53:48.545 --> 53:54.508
Dear Sir...

53:54.593 --> 53:57.001
"Dear Sir...

53:57.095 --> 54:00.678
"I wish to acquaint you with
some of the occurrences...

54:00.766 --> 54:03.767
"of the present, past and future.

54:05.854 --> 54:10.267
It will pay government to give
those people who are suffering... "

54:10.359 --> 54:13.609
...justice and liberty.

54:13.695 --> 54:16.447
"... justice and liberty.

54:16.532 --> 54:22.237
"I seek revenge for the evil
name given me and my relations.

54:22.329 --> 54:25.365
By the light that shines,
this is my warning. "

54:25.457 --> 54:28.791
My brother and sisters and mother...

54:28.877 --> 54:33.623
have to put up with the brutal and
cowardly conduct of a parcel of...

54:33.715 --> 54:37.499
- "... big, ugly... " ... big, ugly, fat
-necked...

54:37.594 --> 54:40.381
- "... fat-necked...
" - Wombat-headed.

54:40.472 --> 54:42.132
Wombat-headed.

54:42.224 --> 54:44.893
"... wombat-headed,
big-bellied... "

54:44.977 --> 54:48.511
- Magpie-legged! Magpie-legged.
Thank you very much, ma'am.

54:48.605 --> 54:51.227
- Joe, write that down. Magpie
-legged.

54:51.316 --> 54:54.768
"... narrow-hipped,
splaw-footed...

54:54.862 --> 54:57.566
sons of Irish bailiffs... "

54:57.656 --> 55:01.405
Or English landlords better
known as what? Victorian police.

55:05.247 --> 55:10.834
This section here you might find
less amusing, Superintendent.

55:10.919 --> 55:14.371
I give fair warning to all those
who have reason to fear me...

55:14.464 --> 55:16.956
not to attempt to reside in Victoria.

55:17.050 --> 55:21.677
Neglect this and abide
by the consequences...

55:21.763 --> 55:24.681
which shall be worse than
than the rust in the wheat.

55:24.766 --> 55:28.978
I do not wish to give this order
full force without timely warning...

55:29.062 --> 55:31.636
but I am a widow's son outlawed...

55:32.816 --> 55:35.568
and my orders must be obeyed.

55:40.032 --> 55:42.605
Hey! Look! It's Ned Kelly.

55:42.701 --> 55:45.488
- Look!
- Oh, my God.

55:45.579 --> 55:49.078
It's Ned Kelly and Joe Byrne.

55:51.543 --> 55:53.666
Can I get a kiss then?

55:54.922 --> 55:56.998
Of course you can.

55:58.550 --> 56:01.302
And a ladies' man, eh?

56:02.471 --> 56:05.341
Where will you go, Ned?

56:06.600 --> 56:08.593
The country belongs to us.

56:08.685 --> 56:12.849
And we'll go wherever we like.

57:08.871 --> 57:12.915
I hear you're planning on getting
married, starting a family.

57:14.918 --> 57:17.326
Well, I'll tell you this, lad.

57:17.421 --> 57:19.710
Lack of cooperation will
make it very hard for me...

57:19.798 --> 57:22.420
to get you out of here and
back to that girl of yours.

57:22.509 --> 57:24.917
I got nothing to tell you.

57:25.012 --> 57:28.796
I don't need to tell you about the
reward out. It's a lot of money.

57:28.891 --> 57:31.595
You could put it to good use.

57:36.690 --> 57:40.770
You're a friend of
Joseph Byrne, aren't you?

57:40.861 --> 57:43.731
You've known each
other since childhood...

57:43.822 --> 57:45.779
served time together, isn't that right?

57:47.951 --> 57:50.988
Aaron, it's the Kellys we want.

57:51.079 --> 57:53.487
We don't care about Joe.

57:53.582 --> 57:56.583
If we let this run its course...

57:56.668 --> 57:58.661
he'll be shot down like the others.

57:58.754 --> 58:02.917
The only chance your friend will have...

58:03.008 --> 58:05.001
depends on you.

58:05.093 --> 58:07.584
If you'll help me with this...

58:09.139 --> 58:11.298
I'll guarantee his safety.

58:36.166 --> 58:38.325
Ned!

58:47.094 --> 58:50.011
Jesus Christ. Come on.

58:56.937 --> 58:59.179
Let's go.

59:41.398 --> 59:43.474
Sir.

01:00:39.581 --> 01:00:42.155
They've poisoned it.

01:00:48.757 --> 01:00:52.755
Lying low, living in caves,
you get to learn sometimes.

01:00:54.388 --> 01:00:59.299
Eventually, you can read
soils and rocks like books.

01:01:12.489 --> 01:01:15.241
I've watched gravel fade.

01:01:16.702 --> 01:01:19.323
Dust settle into crust.

01:01:22.583 --> 01:01:24.622
I've seen drips of water...

01:01:24.710 --> 01:01:26.998
turn to stone that defied gravity.

01:01:39.141 --> 01:01:41.714
I've turned blood red with cave mud.

01:02:04.458 --> 01:02:08.325
I've been a bloody rock.

01:03:57.070 --> 01:03:59.906
Aaah! Oh!

01:04:02.993 --> 01:04:04.986
Sorry.

01:04:05.078 --> 01:04:07.949
Wait... Please.

01:04:09.249 --> 01:04:11.538
Can you help...

01:04:11.627 --> 01:04:14.462
to scrub my back?

01:04:16.507 --> 01:04:18.084
I can't reach.

01:04:21.178 --> 01:04:24.013
Where's your husband?

01:04:24.097 --> 01:04:27.348
Out looking for you, like
the rest of the country.

01:04:31.188 --> 01:04:33.264
You took a risk coming here.

01:04:35.651 --> 01:04:37.939
Well, turn me in so.

01:04:44.618 --> 01:04:48.568
- You think God'll forgive us for what we've done, Ned?
- I don't know.

01:04:50.249 --> 01:04:53.368
I suppose we're all
gonna find out one day.

01:04:55.879 --> 01:04:58.916
Just thinking of Ma
rottin' away in that cell.

01:05:06.306 --> 01:05:09.426
Where do you think
Da is, heaven or hell?

01:05:14.064 --> 01:05:16.733
No. He wouldn't be in hell, you know.

01:05:18.402 --> 01:05:21.853
He wasn't such a bad fella. He...

01:05:21.947 --> 01:05:25.067
He was just a dumb paddy who
got picked on his whole life.

01:05:26.660 --> 01:05:29.780
And that does something
to your pride, you know?

01:05:29.872 --> 01:05:32.244
Can't even picture him.

01:05:34.877 --> 01:05:38.328
When I was 10 and they gave
me that green-and-gold sash...

01:05:38.422 --> 01:05:41.542
for saving that kid from drowning...

01:05:41.633 --> 01:05:45.002
that was the last time I remember him.

01:05:48.348 --> 01:05:51.433
He was proud of me that day.

01:05:55.772 --> 01:05:58.477
We gonna be okay, Ned?

01:06:00.444 --> 01:06:03.694
Of course we are, you little gorn, you.

01:06:19.713 --> 01:06:22.999
You're just gonna keep
running, aren't you?

01:06:23.091 --> 01:06:26.009
They'll catch you eventually...

01:06:26.094 --> 01:06:28.764
or shoot you down.

01:06:31.475 --> 01:06:34.760
Did you know they pardoned Frank
Gardiner in New South Wales?

01:06:34.853 --> 01:06:36.929
On condition he left the colony.

01:06:37.022 --> 01:06:40.106
- He gave himself in.
- He wasn't an Irishman.

01:06:40.192 --> 01:06:44.521
Then why don't you just leave the county now,
try for a new life somewhere in Queensland?

01:06:44.613 --> 01:06:46.938
No. I can't. It's not about me.

01:06:47.032 --> 01:06:49.605
You know there's more to it than that.

01:06:51.203 --> 01:06:54.323
What would it take to make
you save yourself, Ned?

01:06:54.414 --> 01:06:59.657
Hmm? My husband's best stallion?
Take it. It's yours. Forget the mares.

01:06:59.753 --> 01:07:03.252
- More than that. Much more.
- What then?

01:07:04.550 --> 01:07:07.586
The red one, too, would be nice...

01:07:07.678 --> 01:07:10.513
with you atop of it, beside me.

01:07:13.517 --> 01:07:18.179
For that you'd save yourself,
leave your friends behind?

01:07:20.190 --> 01:07:22.479
And you your children.

01:07:27.573 --> 01:07:30.324
Look.

01:07:30.409 --> 01:07:34.703
You and me had no business with one
another in the first place, did we?

01:07:34.788 --> 01:07:38.204
Wasn't that the whole point of it?

01:07:55.976 --> 01:07:58.182
Don't make me grieve for you.

01:07:59.730 --> 01:08:02.435
I ain't dead yet.

01:08:19.541 --> 01:08:21.700
Rebel!

01:08:28.383 --> 01:08:31.799
- Kate. It's all right! It's us!
- Oh... Oh, you bloody swine!

01:08:31.886 --> 01:08:34.129
- It's Ned. I know. Come here.

01:08:34.223 --> 01:08:36.844
- Oh, my God.
- Now, Gracie, look at you.

01:08:36.934 --> 01:08:39.175
You've grown too much.
Give us a cuddle. Come on.

01:08:43.398 --> 01:08:45.889
Rebel, come on. Come on.

01:08:52.908 --> 01:08:54.901
So...

01:08:54.993 --> 01:08:57.698
I saw that rascal Aaron
Sherritt the other night.

01:08:57.787 --> 01:09:00.575
Oh, yeah? And what did you give him?

01:09:00.666 --> 01:09:02.705
Nothing, you little scoundrel.

01:09:02.792 --> 01:09:07.288
- Hmm.
- The thing is, I saw him talking to this fella...

01:09:07.381 --> 01:09:09.622
all friendly like on the way out.

01:09:09.716 --> 01:09:13.417
Then the fella comes back here and starts
asking me all sorts of questions about you.

01:09:13.511 --> 01:09:16.466
Such as?

01:09:16.557 --> 01:09:19.593
When did I see you last
and where you were now...

01:09:19.685 --> 01:09:22.010
that sorta thing.

01:09:22.104 --> 01:09:25.437
- Is he a copper, do you think?
- I don't know.

01:09:25.524 --> 01:09:28.560
Well, it could've been nothing.

01:09:28.652 --> 01:09:31.273
I just thought you ought to know, like.

01:09:31.363 --> 01:09:33.439
Thanks, Maggie.

01:09:47.921 --> 01:09:50.328
Hello, Aaron.

01:09:52.259 --> 01:09:54.797
Joe?

01:09:54.887 --> 01:09:59.881
Ned.

01:09:59.975 --> 01:10:02.051
So how's things, Aaron?

01:10:02.144 --> 01:10:04.813
Not so bad. Well...

01:10:04.897 --> 01:10:06.889
not too bad.

01:10:06.982 --> 01:10:10.481
I've been reading a lot about you, Ned.

01:10:10.569 --> 01:10:13.404
You're a real terror
altogether, aren't you?

01:10:13.488 --> 01:10:16.324
We've been meaning
to talk to you, Aaron.

01:10:16.408 --> 01:10:18.816
We were wondering if you'd
consider acting as a scout for us.

01:10:18.911 --> 01:10:21.532
We're heading into Beechworth
to rob a bank there.

01:10:21.622 --> 01:10:26.829
A scout? Well, I'm flattered
you'd think of me, lads, but, uh...

01:10:26.919 --> 01:10:30.833
- You're not interested?
- No. I-I'd love to.

01:10:30.923 --> 01:10:35.086
If it was just up to me, I'd be in
there like a shot. You know that.

01:10:35.177 --> 01:10:37.798
But I've got the missus
to think about now.

01:10:37.888 --> 01:10:41.506
- Because between you and me, lads, she's up the spout.
- Ah, she isn't?

01:10:41.600 --> 01:10:43.593
- Ah, sure, that's grand.
- Congratulations, Aaron.

01:10:43.685 --> 01:10:47.600
Oh, thanks. Thanks.

01:10:47.689 --> 01:10:51.105
- How are Dan and Steve?
- They're fine.

01:10:51.193 --> 01:10:53.766
Say hello to them for me, will you?

01:10:53.862 --> 01:10:57.942
We will.

01:10:59.243 --> 01:11:01.698
Well, I'd best get back to the party.

01:11:01.787 --> 01:11:04.704
Mary will be wondering where I got to.

01:11:04.790 --> 01:11:07.660
Sure. You go on and look
after that girl of yours.

01:11:07.751 --> 01:11:10.123
Ahh.

01:11:10.212 --> 01:11:12.288
I will indeed.

01:11:19.429 --> 01:11:24.257
Sorry I can't help you out.
Good luck with it all anyways.

01:11:34.236 --> 01:11:36.644
* I am a native *

01:11:36.738 --> 01:11:38.897
* Of Erin, Ireland *

01:11:38.991 --> 01:11:40.983
* Transported now *

01:11:41.076 --> 01:11:43.567
* From my native shore *

01:11:43.662 --> 01:11:45.655
* They tore me from *

01:11:45.747 --> 01:11:48.155
* My aged parents *

01:11:48.250 --> 01:11:50.326
* And from the maiden *

01:11:50.419 --> 01:11:53.088
* Whom I adore *

01:11:55.215 --> 01:11:57.706
* I've been a prisoner *

01:11:57.801 --> 01:11:59.794
** At Port Macquarie **

01:11:59.887 --> 01:12:01.963
** At Norfolk Island **

01:12:02.055 --> 01:12:04.131
** And Emu Plains **

01:12:04.224 --> 01:12:06.217
** At Castle Hill **

01:12:06.310 --> 01:12:08.801
** And cursed Toongabbie **

01:12:08.896 --> 01:12:11.184
** At all those settlements **

01:12:11.273 --> 01:12:13.479
** I've worked in chains **

01:12:13.567 --> 01:12:18.276
** But of all places of condemnation **

01:12:18.864 --> 01:12:20.358
** And penal stations **

01:12:20.449 --> 01:12:22.987
** Of New South Wales ****

01:12:44.264 --> 01:12:48.511
Aaron, what are you doing?

01:12:55.108 --> 01:12:58.727
Some coppers on horses
followed me until Wangaratta...

01:12:58.820 --> 01:13:03.150
but I met up with Tom Lloyd and Bill and
we gave 'em the slip easy as you please.

01:13:03.242 --> 01:13:05.318
- That's good.
- Here we go.

01:13:14.378 --> 01:13:16.584
That's great, Katie.

01:13:16.672 --> 01:13:20.290
Yeah, well, I wish I'd never bloody bothered.
You're all gonna get yourselves killed.

01:13:20.384 --> 01:13:22.542
- We are not.
- You bloody well are!

01:13:22.636 --> 01:13:26.385
No, we're not, Katie. We're gonna give
'em a show like they've never seen before.

01:13:31.186 --> 01:13:33.594
There's a certain type
of black tribesman...

01:13:33.689 --> 01:13:35.812
that bends in the wind...

01:13:37.651 --> 01:13:39.809
blends into the background.

01:13:46.451 --> 01:13:49.121
Mostly he employs the
help of the dead...

01:13:49.204 --> 01:13:51.411
to destroy other people.

01:13:56.628 --> 01:13:59.298
The "Night Dancer, "they call him.

01:14:07.890 --> 01:14:11.140
God, when is someone gonna
give me some proper cards.

01:14:12.269 --> 01:14:14.475
Who's in?

01:14:14.563 --> 01:14:18.774
Ugh. Fold.

01:14:18.859 --> 01:14:23.022
- I'm turning in.
- I guess all that losin' would make you tired.

01:14:24.698 --> 01:14:28.032
- You in or you out?
- Gimme three.

01:14:28.118 --> 01:14:30.407
- You?
- I'm out.

01:14:37.294 --> 01:14:40.912
What's happening?

01:14:41.006 --> 01:14:43.082
Go back to sleep, love.

01:14:44.218 --> 01:14:46.257
Here. I call.

01:14:46.345 --> 01:14:48.883
Three to the English queen.

01:14:48.972 --> 01:14:51.677
- It's blessed you are, Nigel.

01:14:53.060 --> 01:14:55.136
Aaron!

01:15:18.794 --> 01:15:21.332
- Aaron!
- Who's that?

01:15:21.421 --> 01:15:23.747
Who is it?

01:15:23.840 --> 01:15:26.166
Another one of your
whores, it looks like.

01:15:26.260 --> 01:15:30.008
Just tell her to get lost, unless
she wants her head blown off.

01:15:49.032 --> 01:15:51.903
Lizzie, is that you?

01:16:04.506 --> 01:16:06.463
Joe.

01:16:35.662 --> 01:16:38.367
Why do you think he did it?

01:16:40.751 --> 01:16:43.242
Just for the money?

01:16:46.006 --> 01:16:51.001
Maybe he started thinking he
was some kind of big shot...

01:16:51.094 --> 01:16:54.594
instead of a
shit-kicker's son, like us.

01:17:10.489 --> 01:17:14.107
- We have received word
that one of our informants...

01:17:14.201 --> 01:17:16.193
has been shot dead by the Kelly gang...

01:17:16.286 --> 01:17:18.445
over near Beechworth.

01:17:18.539 --> 01:17:21.824
We will entrain immediately
and proceed to Wangaratta.

01:17:21.917 --> 01:17:24.242
From there, you'll be
split up into units...

01:17:24.336 --> 01:17:26.329
and will fan out across the country...

01:17:26.421 --> 01:17:28.461
encircling the immediate vicinity.

01:17:28.549 --> 01:17:30.956
Stay close to your troop commanders...

01:17:31.051 --> 01:17:33.423
for your orders of march.

01:17:33.512 --> 01:17:37.379
I would remind you all...

01:17:37.474 --> 01:17:40.558
the men we are hunting have
not only plundered two banks...

01:17:40.644 --> 01:17:43.561
kidnapped men, women and children...

01:17:43.647 --> 01:17:46.767
but have murdered three
of your fellow officers.

01:17:48.735 --> 01:17:51.061
They have outrun us before, gentlemen.

01:17:51.154 --> 01:17:54.689
Do not allow them to do so again.

01:17:54.783 --> 01:17:57.357
Don't you worry, sir. We'll
show the bloody animals.

01:17:57.452 --> 01:18:00.288
We'll blow 'em all to kingdom come.

01:18:00.372 --> 01:18:04.915
- These are not animals, Constable.

01:18:05.002 --> 01:18:09.296
These are men who have been glorified
as the leaders of a movement...

01:18:09.381 --> 01:18:12.832
a movement that threatens the
stability of an entire country.

01:18:12.926 --> 01:18:17.138
Underestimate them, and it will be
you who will be blown to kingdom come.

01:18:39.203 --> 01:18:41.195
They say the trouble with the Irish...

01:18:41.288 --> 01:18:43.494
is that they rely too much on dreams...

01:18:43.582 --> 01:18:45.871
and not enough on gunpowder.

01:18:45.959 --> 01:18:49.328
Whereas the English were
shy on dreams, as usual...

01:18:49.421 --> 01:18:52.457
but had plenty of the other.

01:18:56.803 --> 01:18:59.092
Now we had both.

01:19:02.476 --> 01:19:06.176
- I suppose you're the Great Orlando.
- That I am.

01:19:06.271 --> 01:19:09.356
Well, I'm the Great Ned Kelly, and
this here is the Fabulous Joe Byrne.

01:19:09.441 --> 01:19:11.813
We'd like to join your circus.

01:19:11.902 --> 01:19:13.526
Ohh.

01:19:30.379 --> 01:19:32.418
Mm.

01:19:43.642 --> 01:19:46.892
That's right. You're not
seeing things. It's a camel.

01:19:46.979 --> 01:19:51.107
I've got a lion and some ponies back down
the road. And the Great Orlando of course.

01:19:51.191 --> 01:19:53.599
If you're here to rob the
train, you're too late.

01:19:53.694 --> 01:19:56.019
We're not here to rob the train.

01:20:40.991 --> 01:20:43.316
Joe, get this lot inside.

01:20:57.966 --> 01:21:00.837
This good-looking fella over
here is me brother, Dan Kelly.

01:21:02.054 --> 01:21:04.046
These are my friends:

01:21:04.139 --> 01:21:06.760
Joe Byrne at the bar there...

01:21:06.850 --> 01:21:10.764
and Steve Hart there in the back corner.

01:21:14.983 --> 01:21:17.059
And I'm Ned.

01:21:19.154 --> 01:21:23.448
We're all Irish boys and selectors'sons.

01:21:24.993 --> 01:21:27.484
Had war declared on us...

01:21:29.164 --> 01:21:33.114
by Victoria, by New South Wales.

01:21:36.129 --> 01:21:38.205
By the crown.

01:21:38.298 --> 01:21:40.836
And by the London Times even.

01:21:48.058 --> 01:21:52.103
The reward on our heads is the
biggest one yet offered in the world.

01:21:52.187 --> 01:21:54.725
It's up to Â8,000.

01:21:54.815 --> 01:21:57.732
It's a lot of money.

01:22:01.280 --> 01:22:05.573
We're the only four lads
in the whole country...

01:22:05.659 --> 01:22:08.067
the entire empire, in fact...

01:22:09.913 --> 01:22:12.748
that any one of you fine
citizens is allowed to kill...

01:22:14.001 --> 01:22:16.077
no questions asked.

01:22:19.631 --> 01:22:22.549
No, it's true. The
queen said so herself.

01:22:30.684 --> 01:22:36.520
That's right. It's Regina
versus us, the Kelly gang.

01:22:42.154 --> 01:22:45.357
So our plans were set.

01:22:48.702 --> 01:22:52.486
One. The traitor, Aaron Sherritt...

01:22:52.581 --> 01:22:55.072
dead, as arranged.

01:22:58.128 --> 01:23:00.168
Two.

01:23:00.255 --> 01:23:04.549
The police special from
Benalla coming to meet us.

01:23:04.635 --> 01:23:09.380
The line torn up to send the
train to hell, as arranged.

01:23:11.350 --> 01:23:15.217
Three. Superintendent
Hare, if he lives...

01:23:15.312 --> 01:23:18.147
easily worth an outlaw's mother.

01:23:18.232 --> 01:23:22.312
And four. The townspeople
out of harm's way...

01:23:22.402 --> 01:23:24.940
drinks on us, as arranged.

01:23:25.030 --> 01:23:27.106
****

01:23:29.493 --> 01:23:32.743
- Here you go.
- Oh, lamb! My favourite.

01:23:35.999 --> 01:23:38.075
- Ohh!
- Ohh!

01:23:39.586 --> 01:23:41.579
Now, cheer up there, Mr Curnow.

01:23:41.672 --> 01:23:44.376
- You're witness to history.

01:23:44.466 --> 01:23:47.550
How many schoolteachers dream of that?

01:23:49.555 --> 01:23:52.674
****

01:24:02.568 --> 01:24:04.560
Come on, Hare. Where the hell are you?

01:24:39.354 --> 01:24:41.513
Were you sleeping?

01:24:50.240 --> 01:24:52.731
You thinking of using that?

01:24:54.369 --> 01:24:57.619
I'm mulling it over.

01:24:57.706 --> 01:25:00.327
Right.

01:25:01.668 --> 01:25:05.251
You don't remember me, do you?

01:25:05.339 --> 01:25:07.627
You were just a boy then.

01:25:09.593 --> 01:25:12.713
You were riding a Palomino
mare with a white blaze.

01:25:23.065 --> 01:25:25.271
Jane. Yeah.

01:25:25.359 --> 01:25:27.102
Yeah.

01:25:29.363 --> 01:25:32.981
Seems like a long time ago, doesn't it?

01:25:36.495 --> 01:25:38.571
A lifetime.

01:26:04.231 --> 01:26:06.603
Where's the other fella?

01:26:17.619 --> 01:26:19.695
Where's Curnow?

01:26:22.791 --> 01:26:24.784
Ned, Curnow's gone!

01:26:27.963 --> 01:26:30.917
Come on! Give me a hand here!

01:26:36.096 --> 01:26:38.089
Quickly!

01:26:38.181 --> 01:26:40.258
Get those horses off!

01:27:00.913 --> 01:27:03.238
Knights in shining armour.

01:27:14.384 --> 01:27:17.919
- Curnow stopped the train.
- Jesus.

01:27:18.013 --> 01:27:22.093
- What does this mean?
- Hare's on his way.

01:27:22.184 --> 01:27:24.853
You mean we didn't get any of'em?

01:27:24.937 --> 01:27:26.976
Not a soul.

01:27:29.942 --> 01:27:33.061
There'll be a hundred
of them... at least.

01:27:47.292 --> 01:27:50.246
You okay, Dan?

01:27:51.838 --> 01:27:55.457
Yeah, I'm okay, Ned.

01:27:59.388 --> 01:28:01.594
Steve?

01:28:01.682 --> 01:28:04.967
Short life, but a merry one.

01:28:07.854 --> 01:28:12.433
- Joe?
- We're gonna give them a good old fight, aren't we?

01:28:15.696 --> 01:28:18.697
Well, that's that then.

01:28:18.782 --> 01:28:21.320
All right. Everyone listen to me!

01:28:21.410 --> 01:28:24.446
We're getting you out of here!

01:29:03.243 --> 01:29:05.817
Hold your fire!

01:29:05.913 --> 01:29:08.700
We've got women and children coming out.

01:29:30.229 --> 01:29:32.554
It's a trick!

01:29:40.572 --> 01:29:42.944
Stop your fire! Cease fire!

01:29:46.119 --> 01:29:48.610
Hold your fire!

01:29:48.705 --> 01:29:50.532
Cease fire!

01:29:50.624 --> 01:29:53.376
-
- Get down on the floor!

01:29:55.796 --> 01:29:59.165
Keep your heads down! Stay on the floor!

01:29:59.258 --> 01:30:01.546
They fired at us! They shot him!

01:30:01.635 --> 01:30:03.841
Keep as low as you can, you hear?

01:30:03.929 --> 01:30:06.384
All right. Let's give it to 'em.

01:30:06.473 --> 01:30:08.632
Hit the lights.

01:30:23.615 --> 01:30:25.655
Fire!

01:31:09.953 --> 01:31:11.946
They have armour on their bodies!

01:31:12.039 --> 01:31:13.996
Aim for their arms and legs!

01:31:25.719 --> 01:31:27.842
- Ohhh! Ahhh.
- He's been shot!

01:31:27.930 --> 01:31:31.133
- They've shot Hare! All
right. Get back inside.

01:31:31.225 --> 01:31:34.759
Get back inside. Come on.

01:31:44.196 --> 01:31:46.948
Oh! Dan, reload me pistols!

01:31:48.200 --> 01:31:50.607
I got the bastard that shot me.

01:31:50.702 --> 01:31:52.861
Give me that anyways. Rifle!

01:31:56.166 --> 01:31:58.657
Bullets. Come on.

01:32:23.068 --> 01:32:26.104
- Aw. The monkey's been shot!

01:32:26.196 --> 01:32:29.031
Poor little bugger!

01:32:31.285 --> 01:32:33.361
Ah, dear God.

01:32:34.788 --> 01:32:36.662
Oh! Shit.

01:32:42.754 --> 01:32:44.913
Somebody help me, for Christ's sake!

01:32:45.007 --> 01:32:47.379
Keep low! Get around
the back of the bar!

01:33:01.732 --> 01:33:04.436
Can you find me something
to stop the bleeding?

01:33:06.069 --> 01:33:08.062
Get down!

01:33:08.155 --> 01:33:11.738
- To hell with all you bastards!

01:33:45.400 --> 01:33:49.480
Ned! Where the hell are you going?

01:33:49.571 --> 01:33:51.778
Get this lot around the back.

01:34:20.102 --> 01:34:21.975
Ned?

01:34:25.566 --> 01:34:27.523
Now's your chance. Quickly!

01:34:27.609 --> 01:34:29.934
Out that back door there!

01:34:36.702 --> 01:34:38.112
Aaah!

01:34:38.203 --> 01:34:40.825
Ohhh!

01:35:00.267 --> 01:35:03.600
Hands up, the lot of you, or
you'll be shot down like dogs!

01:35:03.687 --> 01:35:05.727
Don't shoot!

01:35:09.902 --> 01:35:12.143
I got him! I got Dan Kelly!

01:35:13.280 --> 01:35:16.197
No, you bloody well haven't.

01:35:29.463 --> 01:35:31.669
Jesus Christ, lads.

01:35:33.008 --> 01:35:35.214
I think I need a drink.

01:36:43.078 --> 01:36:47.123
What I best recall is riding alone...

01:36:49.293 --> 01:36:51.831
with the sun behind me...

01:36:51.920 --> 01:36:54.625
seeing me own shadow cantering ahead...

01:36:54.715 --> 01:36:57.550
against the roadside
weeds and willows...

01:36:59.136 --> 01:37:02.302
and leaving me stretched far behind...

01:37:02.389 --> 01:37:04.382
galloping to chase it...

01:37:07.603 --> 01:37:11.137
Like a centaur in the picture books.

01:38:05.827 --> 01:38:07.903
Well done, Ned.

01:38:13.627 --> 01:38:16.332
I wore it seriously...

01:38:16.421 --> 01:38:19.956
me hero sash of green and gold.

01:38:24.972 --> 01:38:28.138
Proof that I've saved a life as well.

01:39:15.856 --> 01:39:19.307
I'm out of rounds.

01:39:19.401 --> 01:39:22.651
Do you have any left?

01:39:29.411 --> 01:39:31.487
Only two.

01:39:34.833 --> 01:39:38.416
I guess that's all we
need then, isn't it?

01:39:39.630 --> 01:39:41.706
We never stood a chance, did we?

01:40:18.001 --> 01:40:20.492
No.

01:40:24.466 --> 01:40:26.542
Steve.

01:40:27.719 --> 01:40:29.878
No.

01:42:13.116 --> 01:42:16.450
It's Ned Kelly. Christ
almighty, it's Ned Kelly.

01:43:49.671 --> 01:43:52.589
Do you mind if I have this?

01:44:08.649 --> 01:44:11.982
Hey! Look! It's Ned Kelly!

01:44:12.069 --> 01:44:14.939
Ned! Hey, Ned!

01:44:25.540 --> 01:44:28.032
Such is life.

01:44:28.126 --> 01:44:33.334
Despite petitions for a pardon that
bore a total of 32,000 signatures...

01:44:33.423 --> 01:44:36.792
Ned Kelly was hanged on
11 th of November, 1880.

01:44:40.597 --> 01:44:45.971
He was 25 years old.

01:44:47.020 --> 01:44:50.804
** At the end of my days **

01:44:50.899 --> 01:44:53.936
** When I'm called to go **

01:44:56.947 --> 01:45:00.695
** Into the open arms **

01:45:00.784 --> 01:45:04.118
** Of the Holy Ghost **

01:45:06.748 --> 01:45:10.532
** To have lived such a life **

01:45:10.627 --> 01:45:14.542
** As I have known **

01:45:16.425 --> 01:45:20.090
** Oh, fortune follow me **

01:45:20.178 --> 01:45:23.630
** That I'm afraid no more **

01:45:45.829 --> 01:45:49.613
** For my great mistakes **

01:45:49.708 --> 01:45:53.124
** I will surely pay **

01:45:55.631 --> 01:45:58.038
** I'm running low **

01:45:58.133 --> 01:46:03.044
** And the devil is on my trail **

01:46:05.474 --> 01:46:09.139
** When fate delivers me **

01:46:09.228 --> 01:46:12.643
** All I'll ask it for **

01:46:15.234 --> 01:46:19.314
** Is a place to rest and shelter **

01:46:19.404 --> 01:46:21.895
** O'er my soul **

01:46:27.537 --> 01:46:31.405
** Oh, if I could spend my days **

01:46:31.500 --> 01:46:37.455
** Free from the prison of your gaze **

01:46:37.547 --> 01:46:41.296
** Then I could die a happy man **

01:46:47.140 --> 01:46:51.008
** Oh, if I could spend my days **

01:46:51.103 --> 01:46:55.397
** Free from the shadow of my name **

01:46:56.942 --> 01:47:00.892
** Then I could die a happy man **

01:47:23.844 --> 01:47:27.544
** And when I am released **

01:47:27.639 --> 01:47:30.925
** From this mortal load **

01:47:33.770 --> 01:47:36.178
** I'll take my leave **

01:47:36.273 --> 01:47:41.149
** But I don't wanna go **

01:47:43.447 --> 01:47:47.314
** When fate delivers me **

01:47:47.409 --> 01:47:50.944
** All I'll ask for **

01:47:53.457 --> 01:47:57.324
** A place to rest and shelter **

01:47:57.419 --> 01:48:00.870
** O'er my soul ****
