00:41.083 --> 00:43.620
<i>My name is Wesley Deeds the Third.</i>

00:45.587 --> 00:48.921
<i>I grew up fifth generation
Ivy League graduate.</i>

00:49.967 --> 00:52.129
<i>I can tell you my pedigree
all the way back to the tribe</i>

00:52.219 --> 00:54.551
<i>that my greatest grandfather came from.</i>

00:55.806 --> 00:57.513
<i>I was born into privilege,</i>

00:57.599 --> 01:00.182
<i>groomed by my father to be a businessman,</i>

01:00.269 --> 01:02.226
<i>to take over his company.</i>

01:02.312 --> 01:05.850
<i>Groomed by my mother to be a gentleman.</i>

01:05.941 --> 01:08.478
<i>I was told where to stand and how to dress,</i>

01:08.819 --> 01:10.435
<i>how to cut my hair,</i>

01:10.529 --> 01:12.395
<i>and what I would be doing
for the rest of my life</i>

01:12.489 --> 01:15.607
<i>from the time that I was five years old.</i>

01:15.701 --> 01:18.864
<i>And right now, I seem to be on track.</i>

01:18.954 --> 01:20.285
<i>Whose track, I don't really know.</i>

01:22.165 --> 01:24.122
<i>By this time,
my mother thought I should be married,</i>

01:24.876 --> 01:29.461
<i>and according to my life schedule,
it's four months</i> away.

01:29.590 --> 01:32.799
<i>I'll be marrying her, Natalie.</i>

01:32.884 --> 01:34.795
<i>She's amazing.</i>

01:34.886 --> 01:38.220
<i>We're perfect together.</i>

01:38.307 --> 01:41.800
<i>With</i> a <i>life like mine,
you'd think that I wake up happy every day,</i>

01:41.893 --> 01:43.850
<i>but I don't.</i>

01:43.937 --> 01:45.974
<i>My life is perfect.</i>

01:46.064 --> 01:49.853
<i>But I often wonder, am I living my own life,</i>

01:49.943 --> 01:52.731
<i>or the life that I've been told to live?</i>

01:56.408 --> 01:58.695
This tie is too dark.

02:03.040 --> 02:05.247
I think this tie is too dark.

02:06.668 --> 02:07.874
Green.

02:08.669 --> 02:11.037
Green. Green's better.

02:18.263 --> 02:22.427
Maria forgot to put the shoe stretchers
in my shoes.

02:28.106 --> 02:30.768
Babe, you know Maria forgot to
put my shoe stretchers in again?

02:30.859 --> 02:32.816
- Really?
- Yeah.

02:32.903 --> 02:34.769
I'll talk to her.

02:34.863 --> 02:36.854
<i>I'll tell you who it won't be,
Deeds Incorporated.</i>

02:36.948 --> 02:39.280
<i>According to the rumor mill,
the software giant...</i>

02:39.993 --> 02:42.530
No, I've been listening to the radio.

02:44.373 --> 02:45.738
Yeah.

02:45.832 --> 02:48.244
No,no,no.
Listen, this is what I want you to do.

02:48.335 --> 02:51.578
Just get everybody, set up a conference call,

02:51.672 --> 02:54.255
I will figure it out when I get there.

02:54.341 --> 02:56.753
John, don't panic. It's all fine.

02:56.843 --> 02:59.335
I'm looking at the paper now.

02:59.429 --> 03:01.295
Okay. Thanks.

03:01.390 --> 03:02.380
Hello.

03:02.808 --> 03:04.640
Yeah, I have a morning meeting.

03:04.726 --> 03:07.388
Showing the Jones apartment. Right.

03:07.479 --> 03:10.813
Hey, can you tell Jeffrey
to have something cool for kids?

03:11.441 --> 03:13.557
- What do kids like?
- Toys, honey.

03:13.902 --> 03:15.518
Toys. Toys.

03:15.737 --> 03:17.148
Bye. See you soon.

03:17.239 --> 03:18.604
What would you like for breakfast?

03:19.199 --> 03:21.531
Egg whites and oatmeal.

03:21.618 --> 03:23.575
Egg whites and oatmeal will be fine.

03:23.829 --> 03:25.445
And don't forget the grapefruit juice.

03:25.914 --> 03:28.372
- And grapefruit juice?
- Right here.

03:47.602 --> 03:49.309
- I don't care, Walter!
- Fine.

03:49.396 --> 03:50.852
It doesn't matter to me! Neither do you!

03:50.939 --> 03:52.145
Get out of here, then!

03:52.232 --> 03:54.849
You know what? Karma's a bitch!
And you're gonna get yours.

03:54.943 --> 03:55.899
Walter!

03:55.986 --> 03:59.024
You're crazy! You're a drunkard!
And you're a nobody!

03:59.114 --> 04:01.321
- Trick.
- Oh, yeah, I'm a trick?

04:02.242 --> 04:04.574
Don't look at me like that, just drive!

04:05.036 --> 04:06.777
- Walter. ..
- Just drive!

04:08.665 --> 04:10.952
Walter, how long before
you get your driver's license back?

04:12.294 --> 04:13.830
You tired of driving me already?

04:15.547 --> 04:18.209
You know what, I'll get a driver.
Don't you worry about me. I don't need you.

04:18.300 --> 04:21.509
I didn't say I was tired of driving you.
I just asked you a question, that's all.

04:21.970 --> 04:23.631
I don't know.

04:25.474 --> 04:27.681
Mom won't speak to the judge.

04:31.688 --> 04:33.929
- Would you do it?
- No!

04:34.024 --> 04:36.231
Come on. Please!

04:36.818 --> 04:39.526
Why can't you just get your license back
just like everybody else

04:39.613 --> 04:41.024
who's had several DUls?

04:41.114 --> 04:44.197
You know, Dad would've done it for me.
'Cause he loved me.

04:44.284 --> 04:46.070
We all love you, okay?

04:46.161 --> 04:47.902
Well, Mom has a weird way of showing it.

04:47.996 --> 04:51.114
She's been through a lot with you, man,
she's tired.

04:51.208 --> 04:53.700
Get a tie out of the glove box.
We're seeing her for lunch.

04:53.794 --> 04:56.912
Hell, no. Hell, no! I ain't going.
Take me home, Wesley!

04:57.005 --> 04:58.871
We're going to work,
then we're going to lunch.

04:58.965 --> 05:00.000
Okay, just shut up!

05:06.014 --> 05:08.426
I'll have it later, when I get off.

05:08.517 --> 05:12.852
Lindsey, you know,
the owner could have the sheriff here today.

05:12.938 --> 05:15.726
Come on, Milton. Just take one for the team.

05:15.816 --> 05:17.727
She's already filed the writ of eviction.

05:19.194 --> 05:22.186
- Will you just give me a couple hours?
- Give me a break.

05:23.073 --> 05:26.361
Look, I'm saying I'll have it. I just need...

05:26.451 --> 05:29.944
I'll have it today. All right? Just tell her that.

05:30.038 --> 05:32.871
That's all I'm asking, just tell her that.

05:50.058 --> 05:52.174
Are we gonna get put out?

05:53.061 --> 05:55.723
I don't want you worrying about that.

06:00.402 --> 06:02.063
How much more do we need?

06:03.446 --> 06:04.436
Ariel, stop it.

06:06.992 --> 06:08.983
Come on, let's get your shoes on.

06:09.077 --> 06:11.068
We're gonna make a stop
before you get to school.

06:12.330 --> 06:14.287
<i>We can expect light onshore wind</i>

06:14.374 --> 06:17.537
<i>coupled with an upper level
low pressure drop off the coast</i>

06:17.627 --> 06:21.586
<i>that will deepen the marine layer
across the coastline today...</i>

06:26.553 --> 06:28.214
We Qot a spot!

06:29.222 --> 06:32.055
You know what? Watch what you're doing!

06:34.436 --> 06:37.599
You trying to kill me? Damn!

06:37.689 --> 06:40.977
Lady! Listen. Hey, hey.
Look, you're in my parking spot.

06:41.067 --> 06:43.274
Oh, really. Well, you know what?
I'll just be one second.

06:43.361 --> 06:46.649
- Lady, I got a conference call I gotta get to...
- I haven't got time for this right now!

06:46.740 --> 06:47.946
Excuse me? "I have a conference call"?

06:48.033 --> 06:49.398
That ain't how you stop
no black woman in her tracks.

06:49.492 --> 06:51.529
- Walter, don't you...
- This how you stop a woman. Hey, bitch!

06:51.620 --> 06:52.951
Walter!

06:54.623 --> 06:56.660
Who the hell are you calling "bitch"?

06:56.875 --> 06:58.457
The man said move your car!

07:02.547 --> 07:04.208
- Hey! Hey!
- Walter!

07:04.299 --> 07:07.462
That mouth of yours
is gonna get you killed, man.

07:09.679 --> 07:12.137
Hey, Kat. Yeah, man, this is Walt Deeds.

07:12.223 --> 07:15.636
Listen, I need a tow truck in the parking lot.
Some lady parked in my brother's spot.

07:18.021 --> 07:19.386
Thanks.

07:19.481 --> 07:22.473
This woman left her child in the car, man.

07:22.984 --> 07:25.601
So? That car and that kid
are about to get towed, man.

07:25.695 --> 07:29.859
Just leave your car here,
Kat'll come down and he'll park it.

07:29.950 --> 07:33.193
Call April, have her transfer
the conference call down to the car, okay?

07:33.453 --> 07:35.660
You want to sit here and wait?

07:37.791 --> 07:38.781
Yeah, April?

07:38.875 --> 07:39.956
I don't talk to strangers.

07:40.043 --> 07:41.625
Wes wants the conference call
transferred to the car.

07:41.711 --> 07:43.167
Thank you.

07:43.254 --> 07:45.370
See? Little black girl already got attitude.

07:45.548 --> 07:46.754
And that little black girl gonna turn into

07:46.841 --> 07:49.208
an even bigger damn black girl
with even bigger attitude, man!

07:49.302 --> 07:54.012
Just get in the car, Walter.
Just get in the car, please.

07:55.058 --> 07:56.594
You know I don't have a cell phone.

07:56.685 --> 08:00.178
It's hard as hell trying to find a payphone
and you're not answering the phone.

08:00.271 --> 08:01.306
Inventory.

08:01.982 --> 08:03.643
Can I get my check?

08:03.733 --> 08:06.350
And then I have to go someplace,
just for a couple of hours.

08:06.611 --> 08:08.272
Your shift starts in 30 minutes.

08:08.613 --> 08:10.320
I know, and I will make it up.

08:10.407 --> 08:12.364
I just... There's something I gotta do.

08:12.534 --> 08:14.195
Be back by 10:00.

08:17.706 --> 08:20.164
- What is this?
- Your check.

08:20.250 --> 08:23.459
No, I know that.
But I worked 80 hours this past two weeks.

08:23.545 --> 08:24.831
So where's the rest of it?

08:24.963 --> 08:27.705
Human Resources got a letter from the IRS.

08:27.799 --> 08:30.541
They said you were behind in back taxes,
so they held most of your pay.

08:30.635 --> 08:33.798
No. I need all of it.

08:33.888 --> 08:35.549
Today. I have to have it today.

08:35.640 --> 08:36.721
There's nothing I can do, doll.

08:36.808 --> 08:37.798
Why don't you call the IRS

08:37.892 --> 08:39.758
and see if you can't
make some type of arrangement with them?

08:40.061 --> 08:42.553
Can you give me an advance on next week?

08:42.897 --> 08:45.855
They're going to take most of your check
for the next six months.

08:46.109 --> 08:48.976
I've been trying to talk to you
about that position from 4:00 to 11:00.

08:49.070 --> 08:50.731
And who looks after my kid at night?

08:50.905 --> 08:51.940
I'm sorry, doll.

08:52.032 --> 08:53.773
- No, you're not.
- We gotta fill it quickly.

08:53.867 --> 08:57.076
If you want it,
you'd better tell me about it now.

08:57.829 --> 09:00.070
Do I have a choice?

09:00.165 --> 09:02.372
I gotta take my kid to school.

09:06.296 --> 09:09.459
With Dexter leaving,
where does that put us, John?

09:09.549 --> 09:12.257
Not in the best place.
They were 75% of our profit.

09:12.677 --> 09:16.420
Hold on a second, when did they get
to 75%? Last quarter it was 60.

09:16.514 --> 09:21.429
<i>When Walt offered them a 12% discount
on all new products, they upped their deal.</i>

09:23.521 --> 09:26.934
It was a good idea at the time. Okay, it was!

09:27.734 --> 09:29.145
<i>Fine, we're in it now.</i>

09:29.235 --> 09:32.227
<i>Get every financial bit of information
you can on Brunson.</i>

09:32.655 --> 09:37.400
I'll be burning the midnight oil on this one,
John, so I'll be up in a second.

09:39.871 --> 09:44.240
Wow. Fat Boy Harley. Nice.

09:49.464 --> 09:51.421
You just ought to do that, Wes.

09:53.468 --> 09:55.425
Do what?

09:55.512 --> 09:57.298
Get a bike.

09:57.388 --> 09:59.755
Meet up with Rich, Josh, in Mexico.

10:00.183 --> 10:02.800
Were you not just on this conference call?

10:02.894 --> 10:04.384
I got a business to run.

10:04.896 --> 10:06.512
I can run this company.

10:09.400 --> 10:11.061
Oh, you don't think I can run the business?

10:11.152 --> 10:12.734
- Walter.
- What?

10:13.988 --> 10:18.027
Wesley, this wasn't even your dream.
It was mine.

10:18.118 --> 10:21.907
- I can run this company, man.
- How about you show me?

10:21.996 --> 10:23.862
Stop saying it, just show me.

10:23.957 --> 10:26.699
Oh, no. Hey. Hey!

10:26.835 --> 10:29.497
- No, come on, please.
- Here she comes.

10:29.587 --> 10:32.500
I'm sorry, lady. You were parked illegally.

10:33.842 --> 10:35.458
You made him tow my car?

10:35.552 --> 10:36.792
You parked in his spot, lady.

10:36.886 --> 10:38.251
I'm not talking to you, midget!

10:38.596 --> 10:40.178
I'm talking to this ass.

10:40.974 --> 10:42.840
- Ass?
- Yeah, you heard me.

10:43.184 --> 10:45.926
- He's the ass?
- I was in there for a second.

10:46.020 --> 10:48.933
Look, I don't know how much they pay you
for doing your job, but I can...

10:49.023 --> 10:50.479
Look, lgot$10...

10:50.942 --> 10:54.025
- Go on, just take it.
- I'm sorry, lady. I told you I'm sorry.

10:54.112 --> 10:55.648
Get your kid out, please.

10:55.738 --> 10:58.526
- No, sweetie.
- Please don't let them take my mommy's car.

10:58.616 --> 11:00.402
- Sweetie, come on.
- It's your mother's fault.

11:00.493 --> 11:02.154
Learn early.
You piss a man off, he will get even!

11:02.245 --> 11:06.204
Don't you talk to my kid!
Don't you say a word to my kid!

11:06.541 --> 11:10.000
- Sir. Sir.
- Walter.

11:10.086 --> 11:12.874
He's a "sir" now, huh?
Gone from an ass to sir?

11:13.131 --> 11:16.544
- Sir Ass ain't got nothin' to say to your ass.
- Walter, Walter.

11:16.759 --> 11:18.170
Please don't take my car.

11:18.261 --> 11:19.626
"Please don't take." You ain't got no choice!

11:19.721 --> 11:22.884
Hey, Frank, get it out of here!
All right, you don't park in a man's spot!

11:22.974 --> 11:24.214
See, that's what's wrong with women, man.

11:24.309 --> 11:26.550
You want to start a fight with a man
and boo-hoo when he fight back!

11:26.644 --> 11:29.636
Walter. Go. Just get the elevator.

11:30.523 --> 11:31.729
Please.

11:40.658 --> 11:42.695
Next time you might want to
find somewhere else to park.

11:44.495 --> 11:45.701
Put it down, Frank.

11:48.166 --> 11:50.658
Jillian, just park my car, okay?
I think my iPad's in the back.

11:51.002 --> 11:52.709
You just sit down.

11:55.840 --> 11:57.080
Ass!

11:58.092 --> 12:01.505
- You see? Move, man!
- Walter, it's handled!

12:01.596 --> 12:03.086
No! You ain't gonna handle it.
I'm gonna handle it!

12:03.181 --> 12:07.266
- I ain't gonna let her call you an ass!
- Get on the elevator, man.

12:08.228 --> 12:10.890
- Come on, man!
- Please.

12:12.941 --> 12:15.057
You like getting walked on?

12:17.153 --> 12:18.359
God.

12:25.453 --> 12:28.445
Ms. Wakefield! Ms. Wakefield.
I need to talk to you for a second.

12:28.748 --> 12:32.537
- I'm running really late for work.
- This will only take a second.

12:32.627 --> 12:35.369
If you get cold, put that on. I love you.

12:35.463 --> 12:37.329
- Bye, MommY-
_l3ye, baby.

12:39.217 --> 12:41.504
- Hi.
- I'm having a day!

12:42.762 --> 12:44.344
I just need to tell you,

12:44.472 --> 12:47.055
you bring your daughter to school late
and you pick her up late

12:47.475 --> 12:50.137
and her teacher has been complaining.

12:51.604 --> 12:53.811
Well, I will bring her on time.

12:56.234 --> 12:59.352
Okay, but I have to tell you.
This is a warning.

13:03.032 --> 13:06.400
<i>I'm not one of your students, Ms. Mackey.
Wear you.</i>

13:24.721 --> 13:27.338
Isn't this exciting, Mrs. Deeds?

13:27.432 --> 13:30.265
Very. I wish I had a daughter.

13:30.351 --> 13:33.184
- Girls are a handful.
- Yeah. Boys, too.

13:33.271 --> 13:34.761
Especially that son of mine.

13:34.856 --> 13:38.565
- How is Walt?
- He's better.

13:38.651 --> 13:42.519
I cannot believe the two of you
are finally getting married.

13:42.613 --> 13:44.354
Do you have any idea
how much your mother and I

13:44.449 --> 13:45.939
have wanted this for the two of you?

13:46.034 --> 13:47.775
Yeah. I think I do.

13:48.870 --> 13:50.656
Well, it's a good thing they wanted it, too.

13:50.747 --> 13:54.285
And pretty soon your little ones
will be playing with my little ones.

13:54.375 --> 13:57.242
I'm beside myself
at the thought of having grandchildren!

13:57.337 --> 13:59.544
Let's get through the engagement party
first, huh, kids?

13:59.630 --> 14:03.123
- You do want children, don't you?
- Of course she does.

14:03.217 --> 14:06.881
Well, you better get busy.
You're not getting any younger.

14:19.609 --> 14:22.977
Looks like
mostly little girl's stuff in this one.

14:24.614 --> 14:27.606
Isn't this nice? At least get $50.

14:28.493 --> 14:32.157
- No!No!
- This, you might get $30.

14:32.246 --> 14:33.987
This is my place!

14:34.082 --> 14:36.494
No, I beg you, please. No! Give me...

14:36.584 --> 14:38.200
Put that down!

14:40.254 --> 14:42.291
- How could you do this?
- I'm sorry!

14:42.382 --> 14:43.838
You let them do this!

14:43.925 --> 14:46.383
I told you she would do this!

14:48.596 --> 14:49.836
No!

14:49.931 --> 14:52.468
- I tried to talk her out of it!
- Yeah, sure you did.

14:52.558 --> 14:54.265
- I did.
- Yeah, sure you did.

14:54.352 --> 14:56.889
- Let me help you.
- Don't touch me!

14:58.356 --> 15:00.597
Yeah, what are you looking at?

15:03.194 --> 15:04.901
Don't you help me!

15:05.738 --> 15:07.945
- Move your car!
- Go to hell!

15:09.367 --> 15:11.358
Lady, what do you think this is?

15:11.452 --> 15:13.034
- Shame on you.
- Let's go!

15:13.121 --> 15:15.283
All right, shame on you!

15:32.306 --> 15:34.638
- Good afternoon, Mrs. Deeds.
- Hello.

15:41.983 --> 15:43.599
- Hello.
- Hello.

15:43.693 --> 15:46.811
- Mom, it's good to see you.
- Good to see you.

15:48.281 --> 15:50.272
Sit up straight. Rise and greet me.

15:50.366 --> 15:53.654
Well, sit up or stand up,
what do you want, Mom?

15:55.163 --> 15:57.825
-"Hello" will do fine.
- Hello, Mother.

16:00.418 --> 16:01.954
Thank you.

16:06.174 --> 16:08.962
- You look quite lovely.
- Thank you!

16:09.635 --> 16:10.796
You should see the wedding dress.

16:11.304 --> 16:14.763
It's not quite my taste,
but it'll work just fine.

16:14.849 --> 16:16.089
I'm so proud of you.

16:16.726 --> 16:18.342
You remind me of your father.

16:18.686 --> 16:20.051
I told you, you shouldn't get married.

16:22.190 --> 16:26.605
Natalie is a respectable girl
from a very fine family,

16:26.694 --> 16:29.903
unlike that trailer-park cheerleader
you married.

16:34.410 --> 16:38.369
Mother, if I remember correctly,
Dad met you at a trailer park.

16:43.127 --> 16:46.836
Mother? The engagement party,
how's the planning going?

16:47.965 --> 16:49.956
Mom?

16:50.051 --> 16:51.041
It's going to be beautiful.

16:53.179 --> 16:55.671
What is this, Walt?
A drink in the middle of the day?

16:56.098 --> 16:57.179
Well, if I have to sit here with you,

16:57.266 --> 16:59.428
you better be glad
it's not a mountain of cocaine.

17:00.895 --> 17:02.886
You enjoy this, don't you?

17:04.190 --> 17:05.680
Yes, I am.

17:07.068 --> 17:08.900
You think it's funny.

17:10.570 --> 17:12.903
Why can't you be more like your brother?

17:16.577 --> 17:18.568
Mom, now look, what's going on?

17:19.329 --> 17:23.368
I wanted to see you.
You insisted on inviting your brother.

17:26.087 --> 17:27.498
Well, you said it was about business

17:27.588 --> 17:32.253
and he is a part of the business,
so I thought he should be here.

17:38.015 --> 17:39.301
Still going to your meetings?

17:39.934 --> 17:40.924
Why?

17:41.143 --> 17:44.511
Yes. Yes, he is. I make sure of it.

17:45.231 --> 17:48.394
Mom. What's going on?

17:50.278 --> 17:53.771
I read the newspaper. Are we all right?

17:54.615 --> 17:57.824
This is just like I thought.
You're worried about yourself.

17:58.619 --> 18:02.578
Your father worked very hard
to build this business,

18:02.665 --> 18:04.906
and to lose it like this would be unthinkable.

18:05.251 --> 18:08.960
Don't worry, Mom, perfect little Wesley's
gonna work it all out for you.

18:09.171 --> 18:11.412
Oh, yes, he will.

18:11.507 --> 18:14.625
And you will find some way
to try to sabotage it.

18:14.927 --> 18:16.713
Where are you going?

18:16.804 --> 18:19.762
I'm going to have a cigarette. Is that okay?

18:20.558 --> 18:22.094
I can't drive.

18:23.185 --> 18:24.220
Wesley has to drive me, Mom,

18:24.312 --> 18:27.145
'cause you have my car locked up
in the office garage.

18:27.732 --> 18:30.190
Okay? I'm going to have a smoke.

18:34.655 --> 18:37.738
It takes the patience of Job to deal with him.

18:40.077 --> 18:43.991
Don't get worked up about it, Mother.
He's fine. It's all fine.

19:06.020 --> 19:07.556
Okay, go on.

19:18.532 --> 19:20.318
Now listen.

19:20.409 --> 19:24.448
I need you to help Mommy and be a big girl.

19:24.538 --> 19:27.326
- You can lay down...
- I'm scared.

19:27.416 --> 19:32.252
No, listen, you can try and go to sleep,
and I'll be back to check on you in an hour.

19:32.338 --> 19:34.170
I want Daddy.

19:34.256 --> 19:37.248
Ariel, don't do that.

19:37.343 --> 19:39.550
Don't do that "Daddy" thing.

19:39.637 --> 19:41.048
Come on.

19:45.893 --> 19:50.137
But you must not come out of the closet,
all right?

19:50.231 --> 19:53.189
And I'll be back to check on you in an hour.

20:05.788 --> 20:07.529
Put the participation
and the operating profit,

20:07.623 --> 20:08.988
and you take that from the gross...

20:09.083 --> 20:11.324
I don't understand what he's doing,
or how he's doing this.

20:11.419 --> 20:13.831
- Can we go home now?
- What?

20:14.630 --> 20:16.416
Can we go home now?

20:18.467 --> 20:20.583
I'm still working, Walter.

20:20.678 --> 20:22.760
And you should be, too.
Did you finish the Brunson report?

20:26.559 --> 20:28.596
Anything else, Mr. CEO?

20:33.816 --> 20:35.022
I'm taking a cab home.

20:38.821 --> 20:40.562
Don't say a word.

20:42.283 --> 20:44.820
You know, everybody around here
is talking about him, it's not just me.

20:45.035 --> 20:48.403
He's not doing a very good job.
He's sleeping with several staffers.

20:48.497 --> 20:50.204
John. My brother.

20:51.167 --> 20:53.579
My father told me to take care of him
and that's what I intend to do.

20:53.669 --> 20:55.501
Can you take care of this, please?
Make sure it's right.

20:57.423 --> 20:59.039
Okay. Look, I gotta go.

20:59.133 --> 21:01.750
Heidi's going out with Natalie tonight
and I get to play Daddy.

21:02.386 --> 21:03.501
Okay.

21:04.680 --> 21:06.717
Come on. Let's do this tomorrow morning.

21:06.807 --> 21:09.048
No, no, I'm not leaving here
until I figure this out.

21:09.143 --> 21:12.261
This one, I'm gonna burn the midnight oil.
Something's up.

21:12.605 --> 21:14.721
All right. I'll talk to you later.

21:14.815 --> 21:17.022
All right, yeah.

21:17.109 --> 21:19.316
- Tell Heidi I said hi.
- Yeah.

21:24.158 --> 21:27.651
Okay, John, okay. I love you.
Kiss the kids for me, okay?

21:27.745 --> 21:29.736
All right. Bye, I love you.

21:29.830 --> 21:32.071
How amazing is it
that he's given me tonight off?

21:32.166 --> 21:33.622
I mean, I can't believe it, we're out!

21:33.709 --> 21:35.325
Yeah, I'm so glad you could come out, girl.

21:35.419 --> 21:39.504
Me, too! I know, the kids keep me so busy.

21:39.590 --> 21:41.297
Okay, Heidi, can we please not talk
about your kids today?

21:41.383 --> 21:42.589
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

21:42.676 --> 21:46.044
You know what? I'm sorry. I'm a jerk.

21:46.138 --> 21:48.926
It's just that all we ever talk about
these days are your kids.

21:49.016 --> 21:53.226
I know, I'm sorry. It's girls' night out.

21:53.312 --> 21:55.929
So we're here for Mark.
No kids, no husbands.

21:56.106 --> 21:59.519
No future husbands.
In fact, I am turning this phone off.

21:59.610 --> 22:02.193
Thank you.

22:02.279 --> 22:04.395
- So how late we gonna be out tonight?
- As late as we wanna be.

22:04.490 --> 22:08.950
Okay. Better call the nanny and tell her... No.

22:09.036 --> 22:13.030
You better call Wesley
and tell him it's gonna be a long night.

22:13.123 --> 22:17.833
No,no,no.
We do not have that kind of relationship.

22:17.920 --> 22:22.130
- What do you mean?
- We just don't check in with each other.

22:22.216 --> 22:25.334
- You don't?
- No.

22:25.427 --> 22:29.170
- What?
- I just don't understand that.

22:29.265 --> 22:34.760
No, I don't have to check in with him,
because I know where he is.

22:34.854 --> 22:36.970
I can literally set my watch by Wesley.

22:37.064 --> 22:39.180
Like, he always does the same thing,

22:39.275 --> 22:43.143
and he's always gonna do the same thing,
so...

22:43.237 --> 22:48.152
Like right now,
I know that he's working late in his office.

22:48.242 --> 22:49.732
Wow.

22:49.827 --> 22:52.239
- What? What?
- It's just crazy.

23:41.378 --> 23:42.709
<i>- Hello?
- John.</i>

23:42.796 --> 23:45.834
Hey, listen, I am sitting at the office,

23:45.925 --> 23:48.041
and I've gone through
all of these financial reports,

23:48.135 --> 23:49.921
-and I see what Brunson is doing.
- What?

23:50.012 --> 23:51.173
He's in dire straits.

23:51.263 --> 23:54.221
He has got this other company
that is interested in bidding,

23:54.308 --> 23:56.174
so he's trying to drive up all of his prices.

23:56.268 --> 23:58.805
That's why
he took the biggest client from us.

23:58.896 --> 24:01.684
It is pretty evident
he can't afford to support him.

24:02.441 --> 24:04.102
<i>You sound pretty sure about this.</i>

24:04.193 --> 24:07.060
I know it, man.
I'm sitting here, I'm looking at it.

24:07.154 --> 24:10.397
It's pretty clever, but I knew I'd find it.

24:10.491 --> 24:13.108
You know what, can you try and get
a meeting with him for me tomorrow?

24:13.202 --> 24:14.818
<i>Yeah, okay.
I'll call him first thing in the morning.</i>

24:27.049 --> 24:29.837
This is a message for Ms. James.

24:29.927 --> 24:32.009
It's Lindsey Wakefield.

24:32.096 --> 24:35.589
I need to talk to you about making
some kind of payment arrangements,

24:35.683 --> 24:40.849
and I will call you at 10:00 a.m.
sharp tomorrow.

24:40.938 --> 24:44.272
I'll be working,
so that's the only time I can call...

24:44.358 --> 24:45.644
Bye.

24:47.861 --> 24:49.147
I'm sorry.

24:49.238 --> 24:52.276
I didn't know that anybody was here.

24:52.366 --> 24:55.575
You do know
that's grounds for termination, right?

24:57.371 --> 25:00.864
You gonna run off,
tell massa everything what's goin' on?

25:01.125 --> 25:03.457
Just give me a break, black man.

25:11.844 --> 25:13.005
"Run tell massa"?

25:15.055 --> 25:18.138
I know about the old white dude
that owns this place.

25:18.225 --> 25:21.138
He's evil to all you employees. Look, I get it.

25:21.228 --> 25:22.559
I won't do it again.

25:23.147 --> 25:26.890
Old white dude. What's his name?

25:27.276 --> 25:30.644
I don't know. You don't know his...

25:30.738 --> 25:33.856
Deeds? Deeds Incorporated?

25:34.199 --> 25:36.782
It doesn't matter.
I'm not gonna use the phone again.

25:36.869 --> 25:38.030
MASS-ll

25:41.081 --> 25:44.199
You think you gonna get some ass
to keep your mouth shut?

25:44.293 --> 25:45.408
What is wrong with you?

25:45.502 --> 25:49.291
Lady, I wasn't asking for ass.

25:49.381 --> 25:51.839
You called me an ass,

25:52.885 --> 25:55.001
when you parked in my spot.

25:56.638 --> 25:59.005
Yes, that was me. I'm so sorry.

25:59.099 --> 26:01.841
I really need this job.
I'm in all kinds of... Please.

26:01.935 --> 26:06.179
When I saw your child sitting in that car,
she was afraid.

26:06.690 --> 26:10.934
Reminded me of the time that my parents
took me to the Maldives one summer.

26:11.278 --> 26:15.067
My father said, "Don't go into the sea, son.
I can't swim, so don't go in."

26:15.157 --> 26:19.947
I didn't care. I grabbed the life ring,
soon as he turned his back ljumped in.

26:21.455 --> 26:23.867
I almost drowned.

26:23.957 --> 26:27.541
My father's standing there,
screaming, "Swim, son, swim!"

26:28.837 --> 26:31.955
Children don't really know
what adults know.

26:33.133 --> 26:37.548
You shouldn't leave her alone in a car.
And don't use the phone again.

26:37.638 --> 26:39.629
How many kids you got?

26:42.476 --> 26:44.592
How many kids have you got?

26:45.312 --> 26:46.802
I don't have any children.

26:47.564 --> 26:49.726
Yeah. That's what I thought.

26:50.567 --> 26:53.810
So don't you lecture me
on how to raise my child,

26:55.155 --> 26:56.737
Mr. Maldives.

27:04.706 --> 27:05.696
How'd you get out?

27:09.670 --> 27:10.831
Excuse me?

27:12.339 --> 27:16.003
The water. Your daddy couldn't swim,
so how'd you get out?

27:17.427 --> 27:20.340
My brother. He jumped in and saved me.

27:22.349 --> 27:25.341
See, you should've kept your ass
on the shore.

27:57.843 --> 27:59.004
What?

28:04.391 --> 28:05.973
Are you following me?

28:08.103 --> 28:09.389
Where'd you come from, beautiful?

28:09.730 --> 28:11.437
The babysitterjust dropped her off.

28:11.523 --> 28:14.356
Ariel, can you get down from there?

28:14.443 --> 28:16.684
You know, you really shouldn't be
sitting here on these side streets.

28:16.778 --> 28:19.110
My secretary got mugged
going to her car one night. Pretty...

28:19.656 --> 28:21.021
Thank you!

28:46.391 --> 28:48.348
What? What do you want?

28:52.689 --> 28:53.895
Are you okay?

28:55.776 --> 28:57.517
I was gonna ask you the same thing.
Are you okay?

28:57.611 --> 28:59.648
You're just sitting here.

29:01.281 --> 29:05.525
My car won't start, but it's fine.

29:06.119 --> 29:09.703
I don't know much about cars, but I could
call a tow truck for you, maybe.

29:10.624 --> 29:13.082
Yeah, you did that already.

29:13.627 --> 29:16.210
I don't mind dropping you and your
daughter off somewhere if you like.

29:16.755 --> 29:22.250
No, I have a friend
who's gonna be here soon.

29:22.636 --> 29:24.047
- Somebody's on their way?
- Yeah.

29:24.137 --> 29:26.344
- Okay, I'll just wait, then.
- No! What?

29:26.431 --> 29:27.592
I'll just find a spot here.

29:30.435 --> 29:32.642
He is not gonna park his car.

29:35.315 --> 29:36.476
He is gonna...

29:42.114 --> 29:45.197
Ariel, just keep quiet, all right?

29:49.496 --> 29:51.954
I don't know what this man wants.

29:59.548 --> 30:01.539
But...

30:01.633 --> 30:03.169
I did not invite you in my car.

30:04.511 --> 30:05.672
Hi.

30:07.180 --> 30:08.261
What's your name?

30:08.348 --> 30:10.089
- Ariel.
- I'm Wesley.

30:12.144 --> 30:13.600
You know Ariel's the name of a mermaid?

30:13.687 --> 30:14.768
Did anybody tell you that?

30:14.855 --> 30:16.266
How do you know that?

30:16.940 --> 30:17.930
I know something about it.

30:18.025 --> 30:21.609
I got a friend who has two kids
and they love The <i>Little</i> Mermaid.

30:24.364 --> 30:27.197
- Did you hear my name?
- Well, obviously.

30:28.910 --> 30:32.278
Well, you just told her. It's Wesley. I got it.

30:34.207 --> 30:35.743
Wesley Deeds.

30:39.546 --> 30:40.627
What?

30:41.423 --> 30:43.289
I'm the old white man.

30:52.100 --> 30:53.465
And you are?

30:57.397 --> 31:00.139
- Unemployed, Fight?
- No.

31:00.859 --> 31:03.396
I'm so humiliated. I'm so sorry.

31:06.239 --> 31:08.230
And I called you an ass.

31:09.743 --> 31:11.199
I'm Lindsey.

31:12.245 --> 31:14.486
Good to meet you, Lindsey.

31:14.581 --> 31:17.573
And you don't have to stay here.

31:17.918 --> 31:19.500
It's all good.

31:19.920 --> 31:23.163
No, it's fine, really.
My secretary was mugged.

31:23.256 --> 31:25.748
I felt really bad when she was,
'cause I had her working really late...

31:25.842 --> 31:29.801
- So you want to stay in the car.
- I'll stay here, it's all fine.

31:33.767 --> 31:34.973
You work with my mom?

31:37.104 --> 31:38.435
Yes, I do.

31:38.688 --> 31:41.180
- What floor?
- On the top floor.

31:41.566 --> 31:44.399
- I was on the top.
- No, Ariel, don't...

31:45.153 --> 31:47.565
Don't be bothering Mr. Deeds
with all that chat.

31:48.824 --> 31:50.064
Sorry.

32:02.462 --> 32:04.373
Got a lot of stuff in here.

32:04.631 --> 32:06.121
We...

32:06.883 --> 32:08.965
We're in the process of moving.

32:09.928 --> 32:12.966
Right, baby? We're done. Almost done.

32:13.390 --> 32:14.471
What part of town?

32:14.766 --> 32:16.427
I don't think you'd know it.

32:25.986 --> 32:27.317
Is that your stomach?

32:27.946 --> 32:29.357
Are you hungry?

32:29.448 --> 32:33.362
What? Again?
Sweetie, you didn't eat with the babysitter?

32:35.036 --> 32:37.573
You know, there's a pizza joint
right up the block here.

32:37.664 --> 32:40.281
You want to take a walk?
Would you like some pizza?

32:40.375 --> 32:43.208
No. I don't think I have my wallet.

32:43.295 --> 32:45.912
No, I got it, it's fine. Now come on.

32:46.840 --> 32:48.547
Come on, honey.

32:48.675 --> 32:50.507
Come on, let's go.
It's right around the corner.

32:51.011 --> 32:54.754
- Come on, Ariel!
- Okay, that's what we're doing. Yep.

32:54.848 --> 32:56.680
That's just perfect.

33:20.332 --> 33:22.289
Mark, I think she needs our help.

33:22.375 --> 33:24.616
I need a drink. Is this me?

33:24.711 --> 33:27.669
So, what's going on with you?

33:27.756 --> 33:29.713
What? Why aren't you guys dancing?

33:30.050 --> 33:33.008
- Why have you not stopped dancing?
- Because I'm having a good time.

33:33.094 --> 33:35.085
The last time you did this
was back in college,

33:35.180 --> 33:37.512
-when you broke up with...
- Rene, right!

33:37.891 --> 33:40.883
- What are you guys talking about?
- Why haven't I met your future husband yet?

33:40.977 --> 33:43.264
'Cause you're busy.
He's busy, everybody's busy.

33:43.355 --> 33:47.019
No one is that busy, okay?
I met Rene the first week you met him.

33:47.108 --> 33:49.475
You were in love,
you were falling all over him.

33:49.569 --> 33:52.652
You talked about him all the time.
This man, you do not talk about.

33:53.114 --> 33:56.732
He's amazing, okay?
He's fantastic and I am in love.

33:57.911 --> 34:00.824
- Am I missing something?
- Yes, a good time.

34:00.914 --> 34:03.622
You Debbie Downers are blowing my buzz.

34:10.715 --> 34:11.830
You're really enjoying that, aren't you?

34:12.926 --> 34:14.087
Yeah.

34:17.806 --> 34:20.797
You know, you have eyed that video game

34:20.891 --> 34:22.724
five times in the last four minutes.

34:23.186 --> 34:24.893
Do you want to play?

34:24.980 --> 34:26.469
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

34:27.524 --> 34:31.688
My mom doesn't have enough money
to play fun things.

34:34.114 --> 34:35.980
No, fun things should be free. Come on!

34:37.117 --> 34:39.324
I got a little money, come on.

34:41.454 --> 34:43.320
Do you know how to play this?

34:43.790 --> 34:45.871
Let's see what we got here.

34:47.460 --> 34:48.916
This one? Here we are.

34:49.629 --> 34:50.960
Hey, hey.

35:00.473 --> 35:02.555
She's a pretty special kid.

35:03.184 --> 35:06.472
- Hey, I don't know why she's so hungry.
- Kids are always hungry.

35:10.108 --> 35:11.769
Harley.

35:11.860 --> 35:13.191
- Softail Deluxe.
- Deluxe!

35:13.278 --> 35:14.268
What do you know about it?

35:14.821 --> 35:17.939
Her daddy used to work at a place
called Baker Boy's Bikes.

35:18.158 --> 35:19.648
- On Elm?
- Yes!

35:19.826 --> 35:22.488
- You know it?
- I do, I do.

35:22.579 --> 35:23.569
Well, small world.

35:23.663 --> 35:26.371
I remember when I was a kid,
boy, I would spend hours there all the time.

35:26.541 --> 35:27.576
You ride?

35:27.667 --> 35:31.001
I did once. When I was about 17.

35:33.298 --> 35:35.756
We'd hang out there all day. We all wanted...
It's so crazy.

35:35.842 --> 35:37.879
We all wanted to get Harleys, right?

35:37.969 --> 35:41.132
We just had this dream of riding our bikes

35:41.222 --> 35:43.589
all over the world,
digging wells in remote villages.

35:44.100 --> 35:46.842
So I started trying to learn how to ride

35:46.936 --> 35:51.430
and my mom found out I was hanging out
down there and she hit the roof.

35:51.524 --> 35:52.685
Crazy, right?

35:53.234 --> 35:56.898
I don't think that is crazy at all.
It means you have a good heart.

35:58.365 --> 36:00.356
That's what that means.

36:05.622 --> 36:07.033
So you ride?

36:08.875 --> 36:09.956
You're looking at a pro.

36:10.335 --> 36:13.248
Oh, come on. That I would like to see.

36:13.797 --> 36:15.583
Well, not on this salary, you won't.

36:18.968 --> 36:20.550
So am I fired?

36:23.264 --> 36:24.345
No.

36:25.058 --> 36:27.470
But I gotta tell you,
nobody's ever talked to me like that before.

36:28.561 --> 36:31.428
You park in my spot, you call me an ass.

36:31.523 --> 36:35.733
Shoot, I mean, it's just been
a pretty interesting day, my friend.

36:37.195 --> 36:40.608
- That is sad, if that is true.
- What's sad?

36:40.949 --> 36:42.781
It means nobody's ever told you the truth...

36:42.867 --> 36:44.949
- No, I beg to differ.
-...that's what that means.

36:45.120 --> 36:48.329
People tell me the truth, they're just not...

36:48.415 --> 36:50.076
They're just not rude when they say it.

36:50.166 --> 36:53.659
I wouldn't call it rude.
I was just being direct.

36:53.753 --> 36:54.914
Direct?

36:55.755 --> 36:58.543
- Okay, fine. If you say so.
- I do.

36:58.633 --> 36:59.794
Direct.

37:01.010 --> 37:02.876
Does that turn you on?

37:08.393 --> 37:10.009
- Now you got jokes.
- Look at your face.

37:10.353 --> 37:11.434
Funny, too.

37:14.441 --> 37:17.103
How long have you worked at the company?

37:18.278 --> 37:19.313
A year.

37:21.573 --> 37:25.157
So what is it, this Deeds Incorporated?

37:26.244 --> 37:27.484
What do you do?

37:27.579 --> 37:29.286
My father was a computer whiz.

37:29.873 --> 37:34.413
And he came up with this great software,
sold it to the government.

37:34.502 --> 37:35.708
It was top secret.

37:35.795 --> 37:39.208
About 20 years ago
he got it declassified and went public.

37:39.299 --> 37:41.210
Company went through the roof.

37:41.301 --> 37:45.090
A little help from affirmative action,
because it was very necessary.

37:45.180 --> 37:47.421
From there,
he started buying smaller companies,

37:47.515 --> 37:50.473
taking their ideas, branding them with his.

37:50.560 --> 37:52.301
I don't know what you're talking about.

37:52.395 --> 37:54.682
Did I lose you? Did I lose you?

37:54.981 --> 37:58.565
Just talk to me like a real person.
What is it that you sell? Come on.

37:59.319 --> 38:01.060
Okay, how about this?

38:02.405 --> 38:04.316
We sell computer software.

38:04.491 --> 38:05.652
All right.

38:06.451 --> 38:07.816
My dad's dream.

38:08.828 --> 38:10.068
And he did it.

38:10.163 --> 38:13.656
Speaking of dreams,
was it your dream to be a janitor?

38:16.169 --> 38:18.001
You ask a lot of questions.

38:18.713 --> 38:21.796
I'm sorry. That's what an ass will do.

38:25.804 --> 38:27.169
You said it.

38:28.348 --> 38:31.181
No. I was in nursing school.

38:33.520 --> 38:36.387
I had two years left. I was close.

38:37.273 --> 38:39.184
Two years left? What happened?

38:40.985 --> 38:45.104
Two years ago, her dad died in Iraq.
He was in the military.

38:45.198 --> 38:48.031
So it all fell on me. I quit school.

38:49.202 --> 38:52.615
But I needed a job, so I'm a janitor.

38:54.666 --> 38:57.954
- I'm sorry.
- You know what?

38:58.044 --> 39:01.082
My boyfriend was on his way over
to help with the car

39:01.172 --> 39:03.459
and if I'm not there, or if you...

39:04.050 --> 39:06.542
Oh, yeah, no. Oh, I'm sorry. I understand.

39:06.678 --> 39:09.386
- You understand?
- I completely understand.

39:09.472 --> 39:11.964
Forgive me.
I should be getting home anyway.

39:12.058 --> 39:14.220
- It's getting late.
- You want me to get some of that?

39:14.310 --> 39:17.143
No. Please, it's all fine.

39:17.230 --> 39:18.766
Let's get out of here.

39:26.239 --> 39:28.446
- So, you enjoy yourself?
- Yeah.

39:29.158 --> 39:31.741
Looks like it's gonna rain tonight.

39:31.828 --> 39:32.943
Yeah.

39:35.874 --> 39:37.660
Sure hope your boyfriend gets here soon.

39:37.750 --> 39:39.332
What boyfriend?

39:43.673 --> 39:45.380
Good night, Ariel.

39:47.552 --> 39:50.135
I guess I'll see you around, then.

39:50.221 --> 39:53.805
- Yeah. Thank you!
- All right. Hope you enjoyed yourself.

39:59.355 --> 40:01.312
That man is persistent.

40:05.278 --> 40:07.110
I nearly lost my job.

40:14.662 --> 40:17.404
All right, come on, let's get some gas.

40:42.315 --> 40:44.226
Someone is Sister Sloshed.

40:47.904 --> 40:50.896
- Wow!
- Somebody woke up mistah.

40:52.158 --> 40:53.694
She's all yours.

40:54.786 --> 40:56.948
- Bye, sweetie.
- Bye. Bye, precious.

40:57.038 --> 40:59.700
- Tell John I'll see him in the morning.
- I will.

40:59.791 --> 41:02.078
- Bye. I had a good time.
- Bye.

41:03.670 --> 41:06.958
- Mark, you better not be driving.
- I have a driver!

41:09.092 --> 41:10.674
What is this?

41:13.179 --> 41:15.170
Oh, yeah, you're wasted.

41:15.807 --> 41:18.014
Come on, I'll take you to bed.

41:18.267 --> 41:20.224
I might take you to bed.

41:20.478 --> 41:23.470
- You gonna take me? Okay. Take me.
- Yeah.

41:23.564 --> 41:25.271
I'm gonna take you to bed on the couch.

41:25.358 --> 41:27.099
What are you doing?

41:30.029 --> 41:31.736
All right, babe. Let me close the blinds.

41:32.365 --> 41:34.857
You know how sick
the guy across the way is...

41:34.951 --> 41:36.362
I know.

41:37.203 --> 41:38.534
- Hey.
- Please stop it.

41:38.871 --> 41:40.361
- Look at my ass!
- Babe,babe.

41:40.873 --> 41:43.535
- That's not funny.
- Let him watch.

41:43.626 --> 41:45.208
- He can learn something.
- Really, stop.

41:45.795 --> 41:48.002
Just get the remote off the table.

41:48.089 --> 41:50.456
Oh, my God. Really?

41:50.550 --> 41:54.293
You can't do one spontaneous thing
in your whole life? Just one thing?

41:54.387 --> 41:57.004
Who cares? Let him watch!

42:40.558 --> 42:41.798
Come on.

42:45.354 --> 42:46.685
Go ahead.

43:01.370 --> 43:03.156
Mommy, I'm hUHQTY-

43:04.832 --> 43:07.995
You're gonna have some breakfast
at school. All right?

43:08.753 --> 43:11.495
We appreciate your seeing us this morning,
Mr. and Mrs. Brunson.

43:12.173 --> 43:13.413
What's this about?

43:13.800 --> 43:15.962
We'd like to buy your company.

43:18.679 --> 43:21.467
My father worked his entire life
building that company.

43:22.308 --> 43:23.594
So did ours.

43:24.018 --> 43:25.929
That, I'm aware of.

43:26.020 --> 43:29.308
But I've been looking at your quarterly
reports for the last three years

43:30.441 --> 43:33.149
and things aren't looking too good.
You can't survive with those numbers.

43:33.402 --> 43:36.520
Yes, I can, and I have been for years.

43:36.614 --> 43:39.982
And with the pick up of Dexter Sky,
well, things are looking up.

43:40.284 --> 43:42.070
Dexter Sky, yes, our biggest client.

43:42.161 --> 43:44.823
You just pulled them right out
from under us.

43:44.956 --> 43:48.244
But in order to do that, you had to make
some pretty steep promises, yes?

43:48.668 --> 43:51.080
Puts you in a great position to sell.

43:51.170 --> 43:52.160
It does, John, but you know what?

43:52.255 --> 43:55.168
If I were in the same position,
I probably would've done the same thing.

43:55.258 --> 43:56.748
That's really great.

43:56.843 --> 44:01.383
You think that all these things were done
to get you to buy my company?

44:01.472 --> 44:03.930
Come on. Of course.

44:04.684 --> 44:08.678
Your father groomed the two of you
from birth to run his company

44:10.064 --> 44:12.681
and he managed to raise a stellar successor.

44:17.864 --> 44:19.354
I admired your father.

44:20.366 --> 44:22.027
He took one small computer company

44:22.368 --> 44:24.951
and he turned it into all of this.

44:25.037 --> 44:26.118
He was a brilliant man.

44:26.581 --> 44:28.413
Yeah, well, too bad
you weren't man enough to say it

44:28.499 --> 44:29.534
to his face when he was alive.

44:29.876 --> 44:32.584
- Walt.
- No. All this man ever did was torment Dad.

44:32.795 --> 44:34.832
- Walter...
- You'd rather climb into your damn grave

44:34.922 --> 44:36.629
than watch two brothers
beat you at your own game.

44:37.216 --> 44:38.547
Good day, gentlemen.

44:38.885 --> 44:42.674
- Mr. Brunson. Sir. Wait.
- I've never been so insulted in my life.

44:42.763 --> 44:45.505
Sir, if you could just give us a minute.

44:47.560 --> 44:50.552
- What is wrong with you?
- What? All I said was the truth!

44:51.063 --> 44:54.272
You want to see all of Dad's things sold,
everything he worked for, at auction?

44:54.358 --> 44:55.348
Is that what you want?

44:55.443 --> 44:58.231
Dad would not want to see his son
in here begging!

44:58.487 --> 45:01.070
What are you... Who was begging?
He wasn't begging!

45:01.157 --> 45:02.693
Shut up, John.

45:09.081 --> 45:10.242
Well.

45:19.133 --> 45:21.670
- Hey, how you doing?
- First name?

45:21.761 --> 45:24.298
Lindsey. I-I-N-D-S...

45:24.847 --> 45:25.837
You got it.

45:25.932 --> 45:29.675
- Go on in.
- No, I can't stay right now.

45:30.019 --> 45:31.601
Then why are you in this line?

45:31.979 --> 45:35.563
Well, see, I was just wondering.
I know you have to be here by 5:00,

45:35.650 --> 45:37.516
but I don't get off work till 11:00.

45:37.610 --> 45:42.901
So I was just praying that you could
hold a spot for me and my daughter.

45:42.990 --> 45:46.233
- It's against the rules.
- Please.

45:46.619 --> 45:47.825
How old is your daughter?

45:48.454 --> 45:49.694
Six.

45:50.665 --> 45:53.703
Honey, have you ever been
in a shelter before?

45:55.628 --> 45:59.087
- No, I haven't.
- You should try the Petrie House.

45:59.173 --> 46:01.039
- They take women and kids.
- Yeah, I know.

46:01.133 --> 46:03.124
I did, and they're full.

46:04.178 --> 46:06.385
So this is it, you know?

46:08.182 --> 46:12.050
Okay, knock around back at 11:00,
ask for Jerry.

46:12.144 --> 46:14.306
Tell him Denise said
it was okay for you to stay.

46:15.273 --> 46:17.560
And, honey, this is no hotel.

46:17.650 --> 46:21.518
Keep your belongings close
and your daughter closer, you hear?

46:22.154 --> 46:23.485
Thank you.

46:25.032 --> 46:26.363
- First name?
- Lauren.

46:26.450 --> 46:28.316
Go in.

46:28.411 --> 46:29.776
- Lonnie.
- Go on in.

46:29.870 --> 46:30.860
- First name?
- Renee.

46:39.922 --> 46:42.038
You're upset, aren't you?

46:43.009 --> 46:44.875
Where is your mother?

46:45.553 --> 46:47.169
She'll be here.

46:51.892 --> 46:54.224
When you come to school,
you're very hungry.

46:54.312 --> 46:56.223
Are you eating at home?

46:57.356 --> 46:59.472
Sometimes.

46:59.567 --> 47:02.935
Why not all the time?
Something wrong with the stove?

47:03.029 --> 47:04.861
No. It's...

47:07.199 --> 47:08.655
You can tell me.

47:08.743 --> 47:11.656
I don't want my mommy to get into trouble.

47:14.040 --> 47:16.372
She won't get in any trouble.

47:19.587 --> 47:21.874
We sleep in the car.

47:33.768 --> 47:36.886
It's okay, I'm here. I'm here.
Thank you for waiting, really.

47:36.979 --> 47:39.346
Can I talk to you for a second?

47:40.566 --> 47:41.772
It's not a great day.

47:41.859 --> 47:45.523
Ariel was telling me
the two of you are homeless.

47:45.613 --> 47:46.774
What?

47:48.074 --> 47:50.361
I don't know, she got an imagination.

47:50.451 --> 47:53.614
And all that stuff in the car
is her imagination?

47:55.414 --> 47:58.827
You know what? We're good. Thank you.

47:58.918 --> 48:00.625
Ms. Wakefield, I will have to call...

48:00.753 --> 48:02.664
I will have to call Child Welfare

48:02.755 --> 48:05.417
-if you don't talk to me!
- I gotta go!

48:15.476 --> 48:17.683
What's the matter with you?
Why would you tell her that?

48:18.396 --> 48:20.057
I'm sorry, Mom.

48:20.856 --> 48:23.723
I mean, do you want them
to take you from me?

48:23.818 --> 48:24.853
- No.
-'Cause I'm telling you

48:24.944 --> 48:26.150
that is exactly what'll happen

48:26.237 --> 48:30.652
if you go around saying
those kind of things to people, come on!

48:30.741 --> 48:34.200
'Cause I'm only telling you
for your own good!

48:34.286 --> 48:36.118
Now have you got it?

48:36.789 --> 48:38.075
Yes.

49:00.729 --> 49:01.764
Damn it!

49:20.583 --> 49:22.073
Where did you go, baby?

49:23.335 --> 49:26.123
- Hey. Where you running to?
- No. I...

49:26.297 --> 49:29.881
Please, please, listen. No, no, no.
I want to talk to you forjust a second.

49:30.301 --> 49:32.633
- Please, just let me go!
- No, no.

49:33.679 --> 49:36.387
She's in my office. No, no, Lindsey. Lindsey.

49:36.682 --> 49:39.265
- Did I tell you not to move?
- Lindsey, Lindsey.

49:39.477 --> 49:41.184
- She knows not to...
- Listen.

49:42.688 --> 49:44.975
She didn't move, I found her.
I made her come with me, okay?

49:45.065 --> 49:46.055
She didn't leave.

49:46.192 --> 49:48.274
Oh, God, did you call Child Welfare?

49:49.320 --> 49:52.529
- No.
- Thank you. Thank you.

49:53.699 --> 49:54.860
But I should have.

49:57.036 --> 49:59.949
Lindsey, what is wrong with you?
What kind of mother does this?

50:00.039 --> 50:03.282
I don't understand what kind of mother
would leave her kid in a car...

50:03.375 --> 50:07.289
I had to take this new shift
and I don't have a babysitter.

50:08.214 --> 50:10.171
Sure, I get it. You don't have a babysitter.

50:10.257 --> 50:13.090
But there's surely someone in your family
who can be a caregiver to this child.

50:13.177 --> 50:14.212
No.

50:14.512 --> 50:15.502
No, we don't have family.

50:15.596 --> 50:17.382
Don't you think
I would have done that already?

50:18.140 --> 50:21.758
What about this boyfriend, the one
that was gonna help you with the car?

50:24.605 --> 50:26.061
We broke up.

50:27.691 --> 50:29.022
- Is that the truth?
- Can you let me go to my kid?

50:29.109 --> 50:31.771
No, no, no. Look.

50:32.446 --> 50:35.359
I had to drag her out of that closet.
She was scared to death.

50:35.449 --> 50:37.315
Shaking. Because she was so worried about

50:37.409 --> 50:40.071
what you would say
or what you would do to her.

50:40.913 --> 50:42.278
How often are you hitting her?

50:43.999 --> 50:45.910
I would never do that.

50:47.753 --> 50:50.666
All right, we're just going through

50:50.756 --> 50:52.997
a rough time right now.

50:53.092 --> 50:55.550
And I don't like it,
but she has to learn to be responsible.

50:55.636 --> 50:59.254
You see how ridiculous you sound?
She's six years old.

50:59.348 --> 51:02.557
She's six!
How can she be responsible at six?

51:05.521 --> 51:06.761
That's like my parents.

51:07.231 --> 51:09.188
You're comparing her to you?

51:09.275 --> 51:11.687
She doesn't have a silver spoon
in her mouth.

51:12.069 --> 51:13.685
You just don't get it!

51:13.779 --> 51:17.192
You're the kind of guy who leaves
a $10 tip for a $20 bill!

51:17.283 --> 51:19.866
I want you to calm down,
'cause I've had just about enough of you...

51:19.952 --> 51:22.319
- You just don't understand.
-...this talk about me and my privilege...

51:22.413 --> 51:25.371
- We live in the real world.
-...and where I come from. And I don't?

51:25.457 --> 51:26.947
No, you do not.

51:28.836 --> 51:31.669
Tell me,
how much does a gallon of milk cost?

51:34.842 --> 51:37.004
You don't even know.

51:37.094 --> 51:38.801
Or a gallon of gas.

51:39.638 --> 51:42.471
When's the last time
you worried about paying a bill?

51:44.852 --> 51:46.013
Ariel.

51:46.979 --> 51:48.435
You're not...

51:54.820 --> 51:57.278
- Come on.
- I'm tired.

52:13.631 --> 52:15.042
- Lindsey?
- Yeah, Jerry?

52:15.132 --> 52:16.748
Yeah, come on in.

52:21.639 --> 52:23.676
Just follow me, all right?

52:26.685 --> 52:28.892
Look, it's lights out,
so you want to be quiet, okay?

52:28.979 --> 52:30.435
Yeah.

52:30.522 --> 52:34.015
All right, the rest room's
right down there, okay?

52:34.109 --> 52:36.726
You guys are over here on this side.

52:36.820 --> 52:39.278
There's your bed, right there.

52:39.365 --> 52:40.947
All right?

52:41.033 --> 52:42.819
- Thank you.
- Have a good night.

52:43.327 --> 52:45.659
Mommy, who are all these people?

52:46.497 --> 52:47.987
Just lay down.

53:06.600 --> 53:08.216
- All right?
- Yeah.

53:31.041 --> 53:32.406
- Hi.
- Hi.

53:33.585 --> 53:35.917
- You're up late.
- And so are you.

53:36.588 --> 53:39.125
Yeah, there's a lot going on at the office.

53:39.883 --> 53:41.248
You want to talk about it?

53:41.760 --> 53:44.092
No. I'll get it all worked out.

53:47.766 --> 53:49.677
You were pretty drunk last night.

53:50.769 --> 53:51.884
Sorry.

53:52.438 --> 53:54.645
Don't apologize. I was just...

53:57.860 --> 53:59.692
I don't think I've ever seen you that drunk.

53:59.778 --> 54:02.861
I don't think
I've ever been that drunk before.

54:03.782 --> 54:04.943
Is there a reason why?

54:05.033 --> 54:06.148
Work.

54:07.077 --> 54:09.444
The real estate market is crap right now.

54:09.955 --> 54:13.243
The wedding, the engagement party,
and it's all been

54:14.084 --> 54:16.667
a little overwhelming, and I guess
I just wanted to let my hair down.

54:16.754 --> 54:19.587
- Anything I can do?
- No, baby, I'll...

54:20.132 --> 54:22.874
I'm gonna be fine, don't worry about me.

54:23.385 --> 54:24.625
Dang it!

54:26.054 --> 54:27.465
What's that?

54:29.808 --> 54:31.298
- Really?
- What?

54:36.023 --> 54:37.104
What?

54:37.191 --> 54:38.773
A blonde hair? In our bed?

54:38.859 --> 54:41.977
- There's no way.
- No. It's a long, blonde hair.

54:42.571 --> 54:44.027
Looks like it's brown to me.

54:44.114 --> 54:46.481
No, no, it's blonde, like a blonde woman.

54:46.575 --> 54:48.566
It's a curly, brown hair.

54:49.286 --> 54:51.744
Like I don't know a blonde hair?

54:52.289 --> 54:53.404
I know blonde women.

54:53.499 --> 54:55.160
- I know they have...
- Okay.

54:55.250 --> 54:56.786
I know what blonde hair looks like.

54:56.877 --> 54:58.743
Blonde, brown, whatever.

54:58.837 --> 55:00.623
And it's in our bed.

55:09.097 --> 55:11.714
You don't think I had some woman
in the bed, now, do you?

55:11.809 --> 55:15.803
No. No, I was gonna say
Maria needs to tell the dry cleaners,

55:15.896 --> 55:16.977
"Be more careful."

55:23.278 --> 55:25.110
Babe, how much is a gallon of milk?

55:25.197 --> 55:27.404
I don't know. You're lactose intolerant.

55:38.210 --> 55:40.326
You're gonna wake that baby!

55:41.755 --> 55:44.213
No! Stop!

55:46.218 --> 55:48.585
Get up! Get up, baby, get up!

55:49.137 --> 55:51.094
Come! Come on, come on!

56:01.316 --> 56:03.227
How can you be so sure?

56:04.570 --> 56:05.981
What, baby?

56:09.992 --> 56:11.858
That I'm not cheating.

56:15.747 --> 56:19.957
You know, a little jealousy
might be nice, Natalie.

56:21.420 --> 56:23.912
Baby, you always do the same thing.

56:31.179 --> 56:33.216
Are you saying I'm boring?

56:35.392 --> 56:36.473
No.

56:38.270 --> 56:43.106
No, I'm saying that you eat
the same thing every day,

56:43.191 --> 56:45.603
you go to work the same time every day,

56:45.694 --> 56:49.062
when we make love,
you do it the same way every time.

56:50.657 --> 56:52.898
I'm saying you're predictable.

58:02.187 --> 58:04.519
- Wesley.
- Morning, John.

58:04.940 --> 58:06.430
Hit me with it. What'd he say?

58:06.525 --> 58:09.734
Well, he and his wife were
extremely offended by Walt,

58:09.820 --> 58:11.436
but they have the offer.

58:12.322 --> 58:14.529
Did he seem interested at all?

58:15.367 --> 58:16.528
No.

58:18.328 --> 58:20.444
As a person who's advised you
for the last few years

58:20.539 --> 58:23.076
and your father for two,
I have to ask you something.

58:26.044 --> 58:30.538
I hate it when you come in with
this advisory tone early in the morning.

58:35.595 --> 58:37.711
You think your brother's
trying to sabotage you?

58:43.020 --> 58:45.261
No. I don't.

58:48.400 --> 58:51.062
Wesley, all I'm gonna say is
that he wants to run this place.

58:51.153 --> 58:54.987
So if you fail, he can tell everybody
that he was right and your father was wrong

58:55.073 --> 58:56.438
-for giving you the position.
- Hey!

58:56.533 --> 58:57.819
- What?
- You didn't pick me up.

58:58.118 --> 58:59.483
I waited 20 minutes out there for you.

58:59.578 --> 59:01.410
Well, just give me my damn keys
and I'll drive myself, Wes.

59:01.496 --> 59:03.407
I'm not giving you your keys
and you know why.

59:03.498 --> 59:04.988
I'll talk to you later.

59:05.333 --> 59:06.744
You do that, John.

59:09.129 --> 59:10.335
What are you trying...

59:10.422 --> 59:12.584
Mr. Deeds, this was left on my desk for you.

59:13.759 --> 59:15.170
Who's Lindsey?

59:15.260 --> 59:17.092
Thank you, April.

59:18.722 --> 59:20.087
Who's this?

59:21.808 --> 59:23.298
Who's Lindsey?

59:26.646 --> 59:28.353
She's the night janitor.

59:28.440 --> 59:29.805
Night janitor.

59:29.900 --> 59:32.016
So why's she leaving you messages?
You screwing her?

59:32.110 --> 59:34.317
Why don't you just go to work, Walter?

59:34.905 --> 59:37.897
Wait, are you still mad at me
about yesterday? You...

59:38.200 --> 59:40.737
Look, I'm sorry
about the other day, all right?

59:40.827 --> 59:44.411
I can't stomach people disrespecting us
to our face, Wes.

59:44.664 --> 59:48.328
Nobody was disrespecting you,
you were disrespectful to them.

59:48.502 --> 59:50.118
I can do better. You want me to call them?

59:50.212 --> 59:51.873
I'll call Brunson and I'll smooth it over.

59:51.963 --> 59:53.545
That's the last thing you're gonna do.

59:53.632 --> 59:56.249
All right, so then what would you
like me to do, CEO?

59:59.221 --> 01:00:01.178
Why don't you just go to work, Walter?

01:00:17.114 --> 01:00:18.479
Wait a second.

01:00:23.912 --> 01:00:26.153
Excuse me. How much does this cost?

01:00:26.248 --> 01:00:28.706
Mr. Deeds says it's free for employees.

01:00:28.792 --> 01:00:30.499
- Everybody?
- Yes.

01:00:45.142 --> 01:00:47.053
I'm so sorry. I'll come back later.

01:00:47.227 --> 01:00:48.843
No, no, no, it's okay.

01:00:48.937 --> 01:00:51.895
I've got a bunch of things over there
need to be taken care of,

01:00:51.982 --> 01:00:53.689
trash on that side.

01:00:54.234 --> 01:00:55.565
Thank you.

01:00:57.195 --> 01:00:58.230
Sure.

01:00:59.030 --> 01:01:02.898
No, for the child day care...

01:01:02.993 --> 01:01:04.575
Well, I should say night care.

01:01:04.661 --> 01:01:06.026
Thank you.

01:01:06.621 --> 01:01:08.487
You're very welcome.

01:01:11.835 --> 01:01:13.621
You know, it's really late.

01:01:15.088 --> 01:01:19.707
Yeah. Got a lot going on.

01:01:21.678 --> 01:01:23.419
Yeah, you look stressed.

01:01:26.349 --> 01:01:27.510
What did I say?

01:01:27.601 --> 01:01:28.887
I... Listen, don't...

01:01:28.977 --> 01:01:33.141
I don't think anybody in my life
will say to me, "You look stressed."

01:01:33.231 --> 01:01:34.312
Nobody says that.

01:01:34.399 --> 01:01:37.187
Nobody's comfortable enough
to say that to me.

01:01:38.153 --> 01:01:40.394
They usually think
I have it all under control.

01:01:41.698 --> 01:01:43.735
Who are you around all day?

01:01:44.034 --> 01:01:45.490
Soon as I walked in I could see that

01:01:45.577 --> 01:01:48.114
your shoulders are
high up around your ears,

01:01:48.205 --> 01:01:50.742
and your forehead is so tense.

01:01:51.249 --> 01:01:53.240
Come on, just...

01:01:54.377 --> 01:01:56.243
Well, what are we doing?

01:01:56.922 --> 01:01:59.289
You really need just two minutes.

01:01:59.382 --> 01:02:03.717
Just you put your knees under the desk
and put your hands on your thighs.

01:02:03.803 --> 01:02:05.589
Lindsey, I don't think this is appropriate.

01:02:05.680 --> 01:02:06.761
It's really okay.

01:02:06.848 --> 01:02:08.759
I swear I'm not flirting with you.

01:02:09.935 --> 01:02:11.642
I figure I owe you.

01:02:13.313 --> 01:02:16.271
Don't forget I was nearly a qualified nurse.

01:02:17.067 --> 01:02:18.102
Okay.

01:02:18.193 --> 01:02:21.811
By the way, nobody talks to me
the way you talk to me, either.

01:02:23.615 --> 01:02:25.447
That's 'cause you're so mean.

01:02:28.286 --> 01:02:29.697
I'm not mean.

01:02:30.080 --> 01:02:33.368
Just like you're not disconnected

01:02:33.458 --> 01:02:36.041
-and cold, and stiff, and uptight.
- Hold on a second.

01:02:36.127 --> 01:02:37.162
Where is that coming from?

01:02:37.254 --> 01:02:39.165
I mean, are you trying to relax me
or stress me out?

01:02:39.256 --> 01:02:41.623
No, I'm just saying,
that's what I thought when I met you,

01:02:41.716 --> 01:02:44.959
but you are incredibly sweet.

01:02:45.762 --> 01:02:48.880
You're a good person. Very sweet, very kind.

01:02:49.808 --> 01:02:51.173
Very caring.

01:02:51.601 --> 01:02:54.844
You just have to set your face right,
I understand.

01:02:58.608 --> 01:03:00.064
There you go.

01:03:00.986 --> 01:03:03.193
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

01:03:06.700 --> 01:03:08.941
What are you listening to on this thing?

01:03:09.828 --> 01:03:11.114
Makaveli.

01:03:12.831 --> 01:03:15.323
- Yeah, and two P-A-C?
- Tupac.

01:03:16.167 --> 01:03:17.908
Tupac, yeah, I've heard of him.

01:03:18.003 --> 01:03:19.994
- The rapper guy.
- Yeah, yeah.

01:03:20.088 --> 01:03:21.328
Makaveli.

01:03:26.344 --> 01:03:28.460
- I love this one.
- Lindsey.

01:03:38.440 --> 01:03:40.852
What? Come on, it just started!

01:03:41.026 --> 01:03:43.267
There's nobody around! Come on!

01:03:43.611 --> 01:03:45.648
Lindsey, this isn't a bar. Here.

01:03:45.739 --> 01:03:49.607
And security will come up and ask
what's going on, so, thank you.

01:03:49.701 --> 01:03:52.193
You care too much what people think.

01:03:52.704 --> 01:03:55.947
But that's cool.
You gotta keep your face right, I get it.

01:03:56.791 --> 01:03:58.873
I'll be back later. You can use it.

01:04:03.214 --> 01:04:04.500
Get back to work.

01:04:05.884 --> 01:04:07.545
Three thirty-nine.

01:04:10.722 --> 01:04:11.803
You say something?

01:04:12.807 --> 01:04:14.548
Three thirty-nine.

01:04:14.642 --> 01:04:18.636
You asked me
how much a gallon of milk costs.

01:04:18.730 --> 01:04:21.722
It's $3.39.

01:04:23.485 --> 01:04:26.819
See, the lesson in that was
for you to find out for yourself,

01:04:26.905 --> 01:04:29.237
not ask somebody to tell you.

01:06:13.678 --> 01:06:16.010
- What's going on?
- Child Welfare.

01:06:18.099 --> 01:06:22.138
She hasn't been attending school,
you can't provide for her right now.

01:06:22.562 --> 01:06:24.894
- You're homeless.
- I know, but...

01:06:24.981 --> 01:06:26.767
Look, get an apartment.

01:06:26.858 --> 01:06:30.522
Get back on your feet and I will personally
help you get her back again.

01:06:30.778 --> 01:06:32.314
Do you promise?

01:06:33.281 --> 01:06:35.238
You have my word, ma'am.

01:06:36.493 --> 01:06:37.699
Please?

01:06:38.411 --> 01:06:41.153
Sweetie? I need your help.

01:06:41.539 --> 01:06:44.122
- Sweetie?
- No.

01:06:44.459 --> 01:06:47.292
I'm sorry. Sweetie, just come with me.
You'll be fine.

01:06:47.378 --> 01:06:48.459
No. Let go!

01:06:48.546 --> 01:06:51.789
Listen to me.
Listen to me, baby, listen to me.

01:06:51.883 --> 01:06:53.715
I need you to be brave, okay?

01:06:54.636 --> 01:06:56.502
I'm gonna come see you every day.

01:06:57.680 --> 01:07:00.672
And this lady can give you
some place to stay.

01:07:02.227 --> 01:07:04.343
Mommy just can't right now.

01:07:05.939 --> 01:07:07.805
- It's time, I'm sorry.
- I'm not going!

01:07:07.899 --> 01:07:09.515
- I'm sorry, it's time.
- I'm not going.

01:07:09.609 --> 01:07:12.101
- Officer? Give us a hand, will you?
- No!No!

01:07:12.195 --> 01:07:13.731
- I'm sorry, you have to come with me.
- No.

01:07:13.821 --> 01:07:16.688
I'm so sorry.
Honey, I wish I didn't have to do this to you.

01:07:17.325 --> 01:07:18.486
Ariel.

01:07:20.745 --> 01:07:22.907
Mommy! No!

01:07:46.354 --> 01:07:48.766
Everything is just falling apart.

01:07:50.441 --> 01:07:53.149
And I been trying to hold on, you know.

01:07:55.113 --> 01:07:58.026
And the more that I was holding on,

01:07:58.116 --> 01:08:00.608
the more everything just fell apart.

01:08:01.119 --> 01:08:03.326
Lindsey, let me help you.

01:08:03.413 --> 01:08:05.120
Don't say that!

01:08:06.457 --> 01:08:08.118
You don't mean it.

01:08:10.003 --> 01:08:13.416
Everybody who's said that in my life
has let me down.

01:08:14.799 --> 01:08:17.631
That's not me. I'm not those people.

01:08:23.390 --> 01:08:26.099
You know I can help you.
You have to let me help you.

01:08:41.993 --> 01:08:44.906
There's a half bath there

01:08:46.288 --> 01:08:48.576
and one bedroom here.
Another bedroom here.

01:08:48.666 --> 01:08:50.077
You need me to clean it?

01:08:52.670 --> 01:08:53.831
Clean?

01:08:56.006 --> 01:08:57.042
No.

01:08:58.718 --> 01:09:00.207
I want you to live in it.

01:09:02.846 --> 01:09:03.962
What?

01:09:04.807 --> 01:09:08.720
It's one of our corporate apartments,
Lindsey. We've got a few of them.

01:09:09.895 --> 01:09:11.352
Nobody's here most of the year.

01:09:11.439 --> 01:09:14.180
You should... You can just live here
as long as you need to.

01:09:16.361 --> 01:09:17.725
I can't.

01:09:17.819 --> 01:09:20.232
- Really, Lindsey, listen.
- I can't.

01:09:22.867 --> 01:09:25.029
I know that you're proud.

01:09:25.870 --> 01:09:29.863
I know that you're used to
doing everything on your own.

01:09:30.541 --> 01:09:34.125
Sometimes even the best of us,
we all need a little help.

01:09:38.925 --> 01:09:40.586
So will you let me do this for you?

01:09:41.551 --> 01:09:42.962
Give to you?

01:09:46.515 --> 01:09:48.256
Does the phone work?

01:09:53.398 --> 01:09:54.888
Yeah, it does.

01:09:57.235 --> 01:10:01.069
So you're saying that I could call
the social worker right now

01:10:01.572 --> 01:10:04.439
and I can tell her that I have a place to stay.

01:10:06.703 --> 01:10:07.909
Please.

01:10:18.673 --> 01:10:21.882
I don't know why you're doing this,
but thank you.

01:10:25.263 --> 01:10:26.674
I better...

01:10:28.099 --> 01:10:29.260
I'd...

01:10:31.102 --> 01:10:32.308
I'm gonna get to work now.

01:10:33.271 --> 01:10:35.933
If you need anything,
I'll be at the office, okay?

01:10:38.025 --> 01:10:39.186
Wesley.

01:10:43.156 --> 01:10:45.488
Thank you, thank you.

01:10:48.202 --> 01:10:49.237
It's okay.

01:10:50.455 --> 01:10:52.366
I thought I'd lost her.

01:10:55.460 --> 01:10:57.042
No, you didn't lose her. You're okay.

01:10:57.128 --> 01:10:58.869
- I thought I'd lost...
- You're okay.

01:10:58.963 --> 01:11:00.294
It's okay.

01:11:02.091 --> 01:11:03.252
It's okay.

01:11:05.178 --> 01:11:06.794
- Thank you.
- Okay.

01:11:09.640 --> 01:11:12.302
I'll be at the office.

01:11:12.852 --> 01:11:15.344
Or on my cell if you need anything.

01:11:16.272 --> 01:11:17.808
Make your call.

01:11:55.144 --> 01:11:58.182
You're gonna break this bed.
We've only just got it!

01:12:00.691 --> 01:12:04.355
Oh, my love, look at you. Look at you!

01:12:05.154 --> 01:12:07.236
Gonna jump till I'm tired.

01:12:08.282 --> 01:12:10.398
Is this our apartment?

01:12:10.493 --> 01:12:11.858
For a little while.

01:12:12.954 --> 01:12:14.820
Come here. Come here.

01:12:19.752 --> 01:12:21.413
Now I know that

01:12:21.879 --> 01:12:24.371
I've been crazy these past few weeks.

01:12:25.508 --> 01:12:27.670
It's just that I was

01:12:29.637 --> 01:12:31.674
trying to help us survive.

01:12:34.225 --> 01:12:38.685
And I'm sorry if I didn't
always treat you right,

01:12:38.771 --> 01:12:42.514
'cause you always make me happy.

01:12:44.694 --> 01:12:45.900
Always.

01:12:46.904 --> 01:12:48.486
I love you, Mommy.

01:12:50.825 --> 01:12:52.236
I love you.

01:12:53.578 --> 01:12:54.818
I love you.

01:12:55.663 --> 01:12:57.449
This tie is too dark.

01:13:03.546 --> 01:13:05.287
Where are you going?

01:13:07.216 --> 01:13:09.708
To work. I started a Casual Friday.

01:13:15.391 --> 01:13:16.756
You know,

01:13:19.645 --> 01:13:21.261
last night, you...

01:13:25.526 --> 01:13:27.608
You made love to me like...

01:13:29.864 --> 01:13:31.070
Like...

01:13:32.116 --> 01:13:33.527
Like what?

01:13:35.369 --> 01:13:38.077
Like you were making love to someone else.

01:13:41.792 --> 01:13:45.660
Well, if I did that,
then that would be unpredictable, right?

01:14:59.745 --> 01:15:00.826
Hey-

01:15:04.083 --> 01:15:05.164
Hi.

01:15:07.169 --> 01:15:09.126
Can I take you to lunch?

01:15:13.175 --> 01:15:14.381
Sure.

01:15:17.430 --> 01:15:19.171
Wes, who is this?

01:15:20.474 --> 01:15:22.056
This is Lindsey.

01:15:23.728 --> 01:15:25.059
I know you.

01:15:26.981 --> 01:15:28.972
- Where are you two going?
- To lunch.

01:15:29.066 --> 01:15:30.227
Lunch?

01:15:33.821 --> 01:15:34.982
Wow!

01:15:36.115 --> 01:15:38.277
- I know, right?
- That's beautiful.

01:15:38.367 --> 01:15:40.028
That is beautiful.

01:15:41.829 --> 01:15:43.991
Hey, Lindsey, come on.

01:15:44.081 --> 01:15:46.288
Get off this guy's bike. What are you doing?

01:15:46.500 --> 01:15:49.083
How are you so sure it's a man's bike?

01:15:49.420 --> 01:15:52.333
I don't care whose it is,
you shouldn't be on it. Get off the bike.

01:15:52.423 --> 01:15:54.539
It's from Baker Boy's Bikes.

01:15:56.052 --> 01:15:59.795
I told them that you wanted to go on
a test drive and they trust me.

01:16:00.306 --> 01:16:03.970
And your name carries a lot of weight,
so here she is.

01:16:06.437 --> 01:16:07.723
Come on.

01:16:08.189 --> 01:16:09.930
This is your lunch.

01:16:10.441 --> 01:16:12.808
Put this on, so that you look cool.

01:16:18.115 --> 01:16:19.401
Are you serious?

01:18:14.231 --> 01:18:17.394
You were going like 100!
I couldn't believe it.

01:18:17.484 --> 01:18:19.976
For someone like you, that's pretty wicked.

01:18:21.655 --> 01:18:23.020
Sorry, l...

01:18:23.908 --> 01:18:26.070
I just lost myself for a second.

01:18:27.411 --> 01:18:30.745
You don't have to apologize
for doing what you feel.

01:18:34.627 --> 01:18:36.038
It was good.

01:18:42.593 --> 01:18:44.709
- You think the road's really dangerous!
- You are really...

01:18:44.803 --> 01:18:46.339
What do you think is gonna happen?

01:18:46.430 --> 01:18:48.171
Get hit by a car! You...

01:18:48.265 --> 01:18:50.973
Oh, my God, you are just such a worrywart!

01:18:51.060 --> 01:18:53.597
- You should just give it up!
- You are a piece of work.

01:18:54.438 --> 01:18:55.553
No!

01:18:58.150 --> 01:19:00.938
Oh, my God! You're tickling me!

01:19:02.279 --> 01:19:04.566
- A piece of work.
- I know I am.

01:19:11.288 --> 01:19:12.653
It's okay.

01:19:19.421 --> 01:19:20.877
I'm engaged.

01:19:27.137 --> 01:19:29.048
You're getting married.

01:19:33.269 --> 01:19:34.805
- Yeah.
- Oh, God.

01:19:35.479 --> 01:19:36.810
I'm sorry.

01:19:39.692 --> 01:19:41.353
Then why are we...

01:19:44.154 --> 01:19:46.236
Why are we even out here?

01:19:46.323 --> 01:19:47.404
God!

01:19:51.912 --> 01:19:56.497
You know, the motorcycle,
that was a really nice gesture.

01:19:56.583 --> 01:19:57.914
Thank you.

01:20:00.921 --> 01:20:04.334
Please. Please tell me you understand.
Please.

01:20:05.259 --> 01:20:06.841
Congratulations.

01:20:09.221 --> 01:20:11.553
I gotta get back to my daughter.

01:20:15.811 --> 01:20:17.051
Damn! Where've you been?

01:20:18.939 --> 01:20:21.021
Left my phone on the desk.

01:20:21.692 --> 01:20:23.558
- You been trying to call me?
- About 10 times.

01:20:23.652 --> 01:20:24.938
Sorry.

01:20:25.696 --> 01:20:26.777
What's this?

01:20:28.490 --> 01:20:29.821
Take a peek.

01:20:30.284 --> 01:20:31.820
There's no way.

01:20:32.369 --> 01:20:34.827
- He accepted it.
- Oh, man.

01:20:36.874 --> 01:20:38.114
- Oh, man!
- Yeah.

01:20:38.208 --> 01:20:40.074
- Oh, man.
- Yeah. Whoa!

01:20:40.169 --> 01:20:42.627
You are all wet. Where did you go?

01:20:42.713 --> 01:20:44.295
Sorry.

01:20:44.381 --> 01:20:46.418
Man, you were worried, weren't you?

01:20:46.508 --> 01:20:49.967
- I don't think I was as worried as you were.
- No. No one's as worried as me.

01:20:50.054 --> 01:20:51.670
Congratulations.

01:20:54.767 --> 01:20:57.509
This is the best news I've had all year.

01:20:58.020 --> 01:21:00.603
- Great job. Great job, John.
- Thank you.

01:21:00.689 --> 01:21:02.179
Our lawyers have the agreements.

01:21:02.274 --> 01:21:04.481
- I'm gonna call my morn and tell her...
- No, no, no.

01:21:04.568 --> 01:21:07.401
Hey, look, let's...
Let's get the agreement signed first

01:21:07.488 --> 01:21:09.274
and have everyone come here on Monday,

01:21:09.365 --> 01:21:12.073
then we make the announcement
and celebrate.

01:21:13.243 --> 01:21:15.701
- Champagne in the office?
- Sounds good to me.

01:21:15.788 --> 01:21:17.779
- Good idea.
- Go change.

01:21:29.426 --> 01:21:32.259
I just got to tell you my father,
Walter Deeds Senior,

01:21:32.346 --> 01:21:34.508
is smiling down from heaven
right now on this moment.

01:21:34.598 --> 01:21:38.136
We took over his competitor and caused
him a lot of stress over the years,

01:21:38.227 --> 01:21:39.183
so I'm very proud of it.

01:21:39.269 --> 01:21:42.261
I know my mother, Ms. Wilimena Deeds,
is very proud of it.

01:21:43.232 --> 01:21:45.269
Thank you, everybody.

01:21:45.859 --> 01:21:48.351
And don't drink too much,
four more hours of work left, okay?

01:21:48.445 --> 01:21:49.810
Hear, hear!

01:21:52.991 --> 01:21:55.449
- Hey, Lindsey.
- You all having a party?

01:21:55.536 --> 01:21:56.776
My brother...

01:21:56.870 --> 01:21:58.861
I wanted to talk to Wesley,
but I'll come back.

01:21:58.956 --> 01:22:01.448
No, no, no. He'd love to see you.

01:22:01.542 --> 01:22:03.533
Come on, he's right over there.
Come on, come on.

01:22:03.627 --> 01:22:06.119
Hey, Wes! Wesley, look who I found.

01:22:06.922 --> 01:22:09.129
Hi. Lindsey, how are you?

01:22:09.258 --> 01:22:11.750
I didn't know this was going on. I'll call you.

01:22:11.844 --> 01:22:14.381
No, no, no. No. Don't leave.

01:22:18.851 --> 01:22:21.434
This is Natalie, my fiancée.

01:22:21.520 --> 01:22:23.102
- This is Lindsey.
- Hi!

01:22:23.188 --> 01:22:25.771
Great to meet you. You're gorgeous!

01:22:26.316 --> 01:22:27.397
Goodness.

01:22:27.484 --> 01:22:29.475
This is my friend Heidi
and her husband John...

01:22:29.570 --> 01:22:31.652
- Who is she?
- I don't know.

01:22:32.990 --> 01:22:35.072
I've never seen her before.

01:22:35.492 --> 01:22:37.950
Mother, you never see the help.

01:22:38.704 --> 01:22:40.320
She's a janitor.

01:22:41.498 --> 01:22:43.114
A janitor?

01:22:43.208 --> 01:22:44.369
Who invited her?

01:22:45.127 --> 01:22:47.334
Oh, apparently, your good son did.

01:22:49.131 --> 01:22:50.337
Hello.

01:22:50.424 --> 01:22:51.914
This is my mother.

01:22:52.676 --> 01:22:54.713
This is Wilimena, Lindsey.

01:22:55.471 --> 01:22:56.506
Hi.

01:22:57.055 --> 01:22:58.216
Lovely.

01:22:58.682 --> 01:23:01.515
- Lovely, you are lovely.
- What?

01:23:02.019 --> 01:23:04.306
How long have you known my son?

01:23:07.065 --> 01:23:09.523
I don't know. Just a little while.

01:23:09.985 --> 01:23:12.101
You know he has a penchant for projects.

01:23:13.322 --> 01:23:14.687
Pen... What?

01:23:15.449 --> 01:23:18.692
Projects.
He loves taking them on, renovating them.

01:23:19.912 --> 01:23:24.156
He buys small businesses,
makes them bigger and better

01:23:24.249 --> 01:23:27.367
and then he sells them, and walks away.

01:23:32.508 --> 01:23:35.296
Did you suck all of the life out of her,
Mom, like you do everybody else?

01:23:35.385 --> 01:23:38.218
You are drunk. Go home and sleep it off.

01:23:38.305 --> 01:23:40.967
No, no, Mother. Why would I do that?

01:23:41.058 --> 01:23:42.093
I'm gonna go get him off her.

01:23:42.184 --> 01:23:44.016
The only time you pay attention to me
is when I cause a scene.

01:23:44.102 --> 01:23:45.092
Walter!

01:23:45.187 --> 01:23:46.427
And here's the good brother.

01:23:46.522 --> 01:23:50.561
You, doing everything
everybody tells you to.

01:23:51.693 --> 01:23:54.936
You know, Mom, I did the deal. All right?
I did it.

01:23:55.030 --> 01:23:57.647
I called Brunson and I went to his house
and I made the deal happen.

01:23:57.741 --> 01:23:58.947
Okay.

01:23:59.034 --> 01:24:00.650
Why is everybody acting
like you can't hear me?

01:24:00.744 --> 01:24:02.485
- I did this deal!
- We know that, Walter.

01:24:02.579 --> 01:24:03.660
Okay.

01:24:04.498 --> 01:24:07.206
Walter, we know. We know you did the deal.

01:24:07.292 --> 01:24:10.034
Don't you dare look at me like that.
I don't... I don't need your pity!

01:24:10.254 --> 01:24:12.916
Dad wanted me
to run this company, Wesley, me!

01:24:13.006 --> 01:24:15.498
- And I can run it, Wesley!
- Walter.

01:24:15.592 --> 01:24:17.458
Yes, you can, right into the ground,

01:24:17.553 --> 01:24:19.715
-just like you run your life.
- You go to hell!

01:24:20.597 --> 01:24:21.712
Take your hands off me!

01:24:28.772 --> 01:24:30.183
Where you going? Where you going?

01:24:30.274 --> 01:24:31.764
You're not leaving, you're not...

01:24:34.444 --> 01:24:35.684
Take your hands off me!

01:24:35.946 --> 01:24:37.607
Give me the keys!

01:24:37.698 --> 01:24:38.859
- Walter.
- Give me the keys!

01:24:38.949 --> 01:24:40.735
- Stop them!
- Oh, my God, stop it!

01:24:40.826 --> 01:24:42.612
Stop it, stop it, stop it!

01:24:43.453 --> 01:24:45.114
Stop! Stop! Stop!

01:24:46.623 --> 01:24:47.988
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

01:24:49.543 --> 01:24:50.624
Stop it!

01:25:17.321 --> 01:25:18.482
You Okay?

01:25:35.088 --> 01:25:36.795
Isn't it ironic?

01:25:38.634 --> 01:25:39.715
We're all stuck here.

01:25:41.928 --> 01:25:43.168
Just like you're stuck

01:25:44.473 --> 01:25:47.465
in a career you don't even want.

01:25:53.607 --> 01:25:54.688
I hate you.

01:25:55.984 --> 01:25:57.770
Let me out of here!

01:25:59.237 --> 01:26:00.568
Let me out of here!

01:26:01.615 --> 01:26:03.231
Let me out of here!

01:26:11.166 --> 01:26:13.248
<i>Let me out of here!</i>

01:26:48.704 --> 01:26:49.785
Hey-

01:26:50.580 --> 01:26:52.241
Are you all right?

01:26:55.419 --> 01:26:56.909
What happened?

01:26:58.088 --> 01:26:59.328
Come on.

01:27:02.426 --> 01:27:04.758
- Where's Ariel?
- She's asleep.

01:27:15.981 --> 01:27:17.597
Oh, no.

01:27:19.568 --> 01:27:21.229
Don't do that!

01:27:25.949 --> 01:27:27.690
What are you doing?

01:27:32.789 --> 01:27:35.622
Do you even know what it is that you want?

01:27:38.670 --> 01:27:40.957
Am I a project for you, Wesley, is that it?

01:27:42.841 --> 01:27:45.879
You gonna fix me up,
so that you can feel whole?

01:27:48.722 --> 01:27:51.635
You got all these people,
they're all around you

01:27:51.725 --> 01:27:54.433
and they all envy what you got,
but the truth is, look at you.

01:27:54.519 --> 01:27:55.759
You're not happy.

01:27:56.980 --> 01:28:01.315
You need to go and find
what makes you really happy.

01:28:03.361 --> 01:28:05.978
Why don't you think you deserve that?

01:28:09.493 --> 01:28:10.983
That's why...

01:28:12.496 --> 01:28:14.237
That's why I'm here.

01:28:22.756 --> 01:28:24.838
You're not attracted to me.

01:28:25.759 --> 01:28:26.840
Look at me.

01:28:32.057 --> 01:28:34.094
I don't think
I was ever really attracted to you.

01:28:34.184 --> 01:28:37.848
We're just both going through
some rough stuff right now.

01:28:43.318 --> 01:28:45.355
Yeah, fine. You know what?

01:28:51.326 --> 01:28:54.864
I get it. You're not...
You're not attracted to me, okay?

01:28:57.874 --> 01:29:01.333
I'm sick of people telling me
how to feel all the time.

01:29:07.050 --> 01:29:08.336
I'm fine.

01:29:59.728 --> 01:30:01.594
Did you sleep with her?

01:30:05.984 --> 01:30:07.019
No.

01:30:12.782 --> 01:30:15.570
I don't think we're ready to get married.

01:30:28.632 --> 01:30:29.838
I know.

01:30:36.097 --> 01:30:37.963
But I love you so much.

01:30:39.601 --> 01:30:41.183
I love you, too.

01:30:52.489 --> 01:30:53.820
But it's not enough, is it?

01:30:56.326 --> 01:30:57.532
No.

01:30:58.495 --> 01:30:59.656
Why didn't you tell me?

01:30:59.955 --> 01:31:02.162
Why didn't you say something to me?

01:31:04.960 --> 01:31:06.450
Mob mentality.

01:31:08.171 --> 01:31:11.084
Our parents, our friends, everybody...

01:31:11.174 --> 01:31:13.836
"Oh, you guys are such a cute couple."

01:31:15.345 --> 01:31:18.337
We bought it lock, stock and barrel.

01:31:21.518 --> 01:31:23.384
I always thought I'd

01:31:26.189 --> 01:31:27.930
find a great guy,

01:31:28.733 --> 01:31:32.647
have him take care of me,
raise a family, live happily ever after.

01:31:33.196 --> 01:31:37.030
I kind of figured out along the way that
I like taking care of myself.

01:31:38.118 --> 01:31:41.031
You're the only woman
I ever wanted to marry,

01:31:42.414 --> 01:31:44.826
have a family with,
you know, it was just you.

01:31:46.126 --> 01:31:47.787
I don't want to have kids.

01:31:50.046 --> 01:31:52.208
And I know you always said,

01:31:52.298 --> 01:31:56.212
"No, baby, you'll change.
You're just scared."

01:31:57.012 --> 01:31:58.753
I'm not scared, Wes.

01:32:01.683 --> 01:32:05.176
And I'm not gonna change.
I don't want kids.

01:32:06.479 --> 01:32:08.186
You think that makes me
a bad person, right?

01:32:08.273 --> 01:32:10.480
No. No.

01:32:11.985 --> 01:32:15.148
What if we're making a mistake, right?
What if...

01:32:16.406 --> 01:32:17.771
What if we're wrong?

01:32:17.866 --> 01:32:21.234
What if I'm the best thing
that ever happened to you?

01:32:22.245 --> 01:32:24.703
What if you're my Prince Charming?

01:32:26.750 --> 01:32:28.991
Or we're walking out too soon?

01:32:29.753 --> 01:32:30.743
Funny.

01:32:33.798 --> 01:32:35.209
You keep it.

01:32:44.893 --> 01:32:46.349
I love you, honey.

01:33:23.181 --> 01:33:25.218
Where have you two been?

01:33:25.308 --> 01:33:26.469
- Mom.
- Never mind.

01:33:26.559 --> 01:33:27.594
- Mom.
- Follow me.

01:33:27.685 --> 01:33:30.222
- I need to tell you something.
- Yes, afterwards. Come with me.

01:33:30.313 --> 01:33:33.055
- Mom. Mom.
- What?

01:33:33.149 --> 01:33:34.560
I need to...

01:33:35.527 --> 01:33:38.064
Come on. The people are starving.

01:33:38.154 --> 01:33:39.235
Hi.

01:33:41.157 --> 01:33:42.647
They're here.

01:33:45.245 --> 01:33:46.656
Everybody!

01:33:47.664 --> 01:33:48.995
The couple!

01:34:00.218 --> 01:34:02.084
I want to thank everybody for coming.

01:34:02.679 --> 01:34:05.341
But there's not gonna be a wedding.

01:34:05.431 --> 01:34:06.967
We're not getting married.

01:34:07.934 --> 01:34:09.095
What?

01:34:11.688 --> 01:34:13.270
We're not getting married, Mom.

01:34:13.356 --> 01:34:15.393
Wesley, can I talk to you?

01:34:18.319 --> 01:34:19.309
No.

01:34:19.404 --> 01:34:20.610
Wesley.

01:34:24.409 --> 01:34:26.195
I've lived for you

01:34:26.953 --> 01:34:29.866
and for Dad, lived his dream,

01:34:29.956 --> 01:34:31.367
but what about mine, Mom?

01:34:32.876 --> 01:34:34.207
I'm sorry.

01:34:36.880 --> 01:34:38.211
I'm...

01:34:39.841 --> 01:34:40.876
I'm leaving.

01:34:41.926 --> 01:34:43.212
Where are you going?

01:34:44.095 --> 01:34:45.711
Travel the world.

01:34:47.390 --> 01:34:49.381
Catch up with Rich, Josh.

01:34:50.894 --> 01:34:52.009
Okay.

01:34:54.314 --> 01:34:56.681
This motorcycle business again, right?

01:34:57.233 --> 01:35:00.396
No. It's about me living

01:35:01.446 --> 01:35:03.562
for the first time in my life.

01:35:06.117 --> 01:35:07.653
John is gonna run the company.

01:35:07.744 --> 01:35:10.236
I've talked to him,
he knows everything about it.

01:35:10.496 --> 01:35:11.986
- So...
- John?

01:35:13.416 --> 01:35:16.158
First Dad screws me over,
now my brother screws me over?

01:35:18.046 --> 01:35:20.037
Nobody's screwing you over, man.

01:35:21.090 --> 01:35:23.081
Everything that's happening to you,
you're doing it to yourself.

01:35:23.176 --> 01:35:25.668
You sabotage every good thing
that comes in your life

01:35:25.762 --> 01:35:27.753
and I can't help you with that anymore.

01:35:28.890 --> 01:35:31.507
That's who you want to be, you be it,
but you won't be it with me.

01:35:32.602 --> 01:35:33.888
I'm done.

01:36:12.642 --> 01:36:13.928
Hi.

01:36:18.606 --> 01:36:19.687
Hey-

01:36:20.942 --> 01:36:22.307
You look great.

01:36:24.404 --> 01:36:28.318
Yeah, no tie.
I just tried to relax myself a little bit.

01:36:35.707 --> 01:36:38.449
I'm so sorry about the other night.

01:36:40.169 --> 01:36:41.500
It's okay.

01:36:44.048 --> 01:36:45.504
No, it's not.

01:36:53.308 --> 01:36:55.219
I'm... I'm...

01:36:55.310 --> 01:36:57.347
I'm not gonna get married.

01:37:02.734 --> 01:37:03.940
And

01:37:06.696 --> 01:37:08.528
I'm leaving tomorrow.

01:37:10.033 --> 01:37:11.569
9:30 a.m.

01:37:15.788 --> 01:37:17.278
Where are you going?

01:37:17.623 --> 01:37:18.829
Africa.

01:37:19.834 --> 01:37:22.667
I'm shipping my bike there.
I'm gonna catch up with my buddies and...

01:37:23.296 --> 01:37:24.377
No!

01:37:24.797 --> 01:37:27.209
Yeah. We're gonna dig those wells.

01:37:28.551 --> 01:37:30.167
That is amazing.

01:37:33.056 --> 01:37:34.512
Good for you.

01:37:37.560 --> 01:37:39.972
'Cause you only live once, right?

01:37:40.813 --> 01:37:41.894
Yeah.

01:37:43.691 --> 01:37:45.147
You're right.

01:37:49.864 --> 01:37:52.947
You did... You did that for me.

01:37:53.993 --> 01:37:55.449
No, I didn't.

01:37:56.829 --> 01:37:58.194
You did it.

01:38:01.667 --> 01:38:05.080
There's an executive here, his name is John,

01:38:05.296 --> 01:38:07.128
and he knows everything
about you and the apartment.

01:38:07.215 --> 01:38:08.501
You'll be fine.

01:38:08.591 --> 01:38:11.253
You can stay there as long as you need to.

01:38:11.594 --> 01:38:13.255
Okay. Thank you.

01:38:16.391 --> 01:38:19.600
I was kind of hoping that
you wouldn't need to.

01:38:19.811 --> 01:38:21.142
Well, I...

01:38:22.605 --> 01:38:25.313
I'm doing both shifts and I figure that
I could be gone in a month...

01:38:25.400 --> 01:38:28.984
No, that's not what I mean to say.
Not what I'm saying.

01:38:31.072 --> 01:38:33.313
I got these two tickets here

01:38:34.075 --> 01:38:35.816
for you and Ariel,

01:38:36.452 --> 01:38:39.114
and I was just kind of hoping
you'd go with me.

01:38:45.503 --> 01:38:46.743
I can't.

01:38:52.760 --> 01:38:54.250
Well, maybe I better

01:38:57.390 --> 01:39:00.098
just leave them there in case
you change your mind maybe?

01:39:00.518 --> 01:39:02.509
No, I won't.

01:39:04.689 --> 01:39:06.020
I'm sorry.

01:39:08.067 --> 01:39:10.809
But thank you. Thank you for everything.

01:39:12.488 --> 01:39:14.479
Thank you for everything.

01:39:29.005 --> 01:39:29.995
I'll see you around.

01:39:31.716 --> 01:39:32.956
Be safe.

01:40:38.741 --> 01:40:39.947
Wesley.

01:40:49.502 --> 01:40:51.539
Came to talk me out of it?

01:40:54.006 --> 01:40:57.215
No. I came to see you off.

01:41:02.974 --> 01:41:04.885
I'm going to miss you.

01:41:10.356 --> 01:41:12.313
Wesley, I'm sorry, baby.

01:41:15.236 --> 01:41:16.692
I'm so sorry.

01:41:34.005 --> 01:41:35.370
Be careful.

01:41:37.967 --> 01:41:39.253
Be happy-

01:41:46.225 --> 01:41:47.556
I love you, Mom.

01:42:37.526 --> 01:42:40.188
This your first time flying commercial?

01:42:54.043 --> 01:42:55.204
You say hi?

01:42:55.961 --> 01:42:57.201
Hi, Mr. Wesley.

01:42:58.047 --> 01:42:59.208
Hi, Ariel.

01:43:01.050 --> 01:43:03.212
All right, baby, go sit down.

01:43:09.350 --> 01:43:10.681
Now, look.

01:43:12.061 --> 01:43:15.725
A lot of times in relationships
people don't say what they feel,

01:43:15.815 --> 01:43:19.399
'cause they're afraid
of being hurt or let down.

01:43:21.195 --> 01:43:24.733
But I want to take this chance with you.

01:43:25.741 --> 01:43:28.984
Even though what your mother said
scared me

01:43:29.078 --> 01:43:33.288
and I don't want to be
a project for you, Wesley.

01:43:34.500 --> 01:43:36.332
I have Ariel to think about and...

01:43:36.711 --> 01:43:37.917
No.

01:43:38.421 --> 01:43:39.536
Mommy!

01:43:40.381 --> 01:43:41.416
Don't look.

01:43:46.053 --> 01:43:49.717
<i>I don't know what's out there,
or what's waiting for me,</i>

01:43:49.807 --> 01:43:52.640
<i>but whatever it is, I'm gonna find it.</i>
