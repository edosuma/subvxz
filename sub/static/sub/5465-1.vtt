WEBVTT

01:34.052 --> 01:36.668
Cold this morning, Captain.

01:45.522 --> 01:47.387
Cold.

01:58.410 --> 02:00.526
And hard.

02:17.554 --> 02:19.715
It's time, captain.

02:23.143 --> 02:24.724
It's time.

02:26.313 --> 02:29.305
Time indeed.

04:47.120 --> 04:51.284
What are you doing? You're supposed
to be upstairs sleeping.

04:51.374 --> 04:54.116
Stanley keeps waking me up.

04:55.337 --> 04:57.168
| get it.

04:57.839 --> 04:59.670
Boy, are you getting heavy.

04:59.758 --> 05:01.589
Don't let her pull more
than her usual nonsense.

05:01.676 --> 05:04.509
Two stories, two glasses of water.

05:05.180 --> 05:09.674
-Jack, you're going to miss the plane.
-Okay. Cricket, you listen to me.

05:09.768 --> 05:13.135
Go upstairs with Mrs Wheeler now
and go to sleep.

05:13.230 --> 05:16.688
On my business trip,
I'll get Stanley a little brother.

05:16.775 --> 05:19.608
-Will you promise?
-I promise.

05:53.895 --> 05:57.763
-Can I get you anything, sir?
-No, thank you very much.

05:58.567 --> 06:02.151
If you try and get sleep,
the flight will go faster.

06:03.113 --> 06:05.525
I can never sleep on a plane.

06:05.615 --> 06:08.322
-Turbulence.
-Pardon?

06:09.452 --> 06:11.943
Turbulence. Solar radiation
heats the earth's crust,

06:12.038 --> 06:13.994
warm air rises, cold air descends.

06:14.082 --> 06:19.668
-Turbu|ence. I don't like that.
-Try to sleep anyway.

06:57.459 --> 06:59.199
Dr Ryan?

07:15.769 --> 07:18.602
Jack, boy, get yourself in here.

07:19.648 --> 07:23.516
-Jesusl You look like hell.
-Thank you very much, Admiral.

07:23.610 --> 07:26.443
-Want coffee?
-I think I need some coffee.

07:26.529 --> 07:29.646
I'm not going to ask you
how your flight went.

07:29.741 --> 07:32.073
When's the last time
you got some sleep?

07:32.160 --> 07:36.620
I don't know.
This thing's still on London time.

07:36.706 --> 07:39.539
-Milk and sugar?
-Milk and sugar.

07:40.085 --> 07:41.791
So how's Caroline?

07:41.878 --> 07:42.958
Last time I saw her

07:43.046 --> 07:46.163
was at your granddad's place
in Maine, wasn't it?

07:46.257 --> 07:49.499
She's fine. Sends you her best.

07:49.761 --> 07:53.003
-And Sally?
-She's fine.

07:53.098 --> 07:55.054
What is she now, three?

07:55.684 --> 07:58.391
No, she's a very precocious five.

08:00.855 --> 08:02.345
She announced
to Caroline and l the other day

08:02.440 --> 08:04.305
that her life would be
considerably less lonely

08:04.401 --> 08:07.893
if we were to buy her a baby brother.

08:09.406 --> 08:13.900
But she decided it would be enough
if we were to buy one for Stanley.

08:15.370 --> 08:18.612
-Who's Stanley?
-Stanley's a bear.

08:22.085 --> 08:25.623
All right. What's important enough
to get you on a plane

08:25.714 --> 08:27.875
in the middle of the night?

08:27.966 --> 08:30.673
British Intelligence
obtained these pictures two days ago.

08:30.760 --> 08:34.628
She's the Red October,
the latest Typhoon class.

08:34.723 --> 08:36.088
Big son of a bitch.

08:36.182 --> 08:38.639
Twelve metres longer
than the standard Typhoon.

08:38.727 --> 08:43.346
Three metres wider.
The captain's name is Ramius.

08:43.440 --> 08:45.772
-One of yours?
-Yeah. I did his bio last year.

08:45.859 --> 08:50.319
He's taken out the lead boat
in each new sub class for 10 years.

08:50.405 --> 08:52.191
Fairly good political connections.

08:52.282 --> 08:55.399
Trained most of their
attack boat skippers.

08:55.493 --> 08:59.031
The Russians call him
Vilnius nastavnik.

08:59.664 --> 09:02.497
The Vilnius schoolmaster.

09:03.460 --> 09:08.329
-What are these doors?
-Those doors, sir, are the problem.

09:08.423 --> 09:11.039
I don't know what they are.
Neither do the British.

09:11.134 --> 09:15.127
Perhaps our friends in Murmansk
have come up with something new.

09:16.139 --> 09:18.425
With your permission,
I'd like to show these to someone.

09:18.516 --> 09:20.507
-Do you know Skip Tyler?
-Sub driver.

09:20.602 --> 09:23.594
Was. Clipped by a drunk driver.
Lost his leg.

09:23.688 --> 09:27.021
He's teaching at the academy,
consulting for navy labs.

09:27.108 --> 09:29.770
-Clearance?
-Top secret or better.

09:31.321 --> 09:35.360
Margie, have a car for Dr Ryan
downstairs in 10 minutes.

09:39.496 --> 09:43.830
A satellite caught Red October
in Polijarny Inlet this morning.

10:24.833 --> 10:26.824
Do you hear it?

10:28.169 --> 10:29.500
No.

10:29.838 --> 10:32.545
Beaumont, at Cal Tech
we used to do this in our sleep.

10:32.632 --> 10:34.293
You hear it now?

10:35.468 --> 10:38.210
Wait a minute. Maybe.

10:40.014 --> 10:43.347
-lt's buried in surface clutter?
-Yes.

10:43.434 --> 10:46.676
-I should go to SAPS?
-Correct, Seaman Beaumont.

10:46.771 --> 10:50.730
Signal algorithmic processing systems.

10:50.817 --> 10:54.651
Give it a week,
and you'll be teaching at Cal Tech.

10:54.737 --> 10:56.318
So...

10:56.406 --> 11:02.823
Like Beethoven on the computer,
you have laboured to produce

11:08.835 --> 11:11.042
a biologic.

11:12.922 --> 11:17.165
-A what?
-A whale, Beaumont. A whale.

11:17.260 --> 11:20.502
A marine mammal that knows
a hell of a lot more about sonar

11:20.597 --> 11:23.259
than you do. Kill the SAPS.

11:23.349 --> 11:27.638
Train over to 2-6-9 and let's try it again.

11:27.729 --> 11:31.938
If he gets to ragging on you too bad,
ask him about Pavarotti.

11:32.025 --> 11:33.686
We don't have time for sea stories.

11:33.776 --> 11:36.859
l was in the middle
of teaching Seaman Beaumont

11:36.946 --> 11:39.107
the intricacies of modern sonar. Now...

11:39.199 --> 11:42.657
I ain't chief of the boat.
I'm Sheena, Queen of the Jungle.

11:42.744 --> 11:45.611
-Cob, please.
-Come on, Cob. Tell me.

11:45.705 --> 11:49.072
Okay. Fine. Go ahead.

11:50.793 --> 11:54.832
Seaman Jones here,
he's into music in a big way.

11:54.923 --> 11:57.005
He figures this whole boat is basically

11:57.091 --> 12:00.800
just his own
personal, private stereo set.

12:00.887 --> 12:03.879
-He gets this piece of Pavarotti...
-He was Paganini.

12:03.973 --> 12:06.055
-Whatever.
-Paganini.

12:06.142 --> 12:07.348
This is my story, okay?

12:07.435 --> 12:11.678
Tell it right. Pavarotti's a tenor.
Paganini was a composer.

12:12.690 --> 12:15.648
Okay. So he's got this music,
and he's got it out in the water.

12:15.735 --> 12:19.523
He's listening on his headsets,
happy as a clam.

12:19.948 --> 12:22.064
Then all hell breaks loose.

12:22.158 --> 12:25.867
-A slew of boats out of San Diego...
-lncluding one way out at Pearl.

12:25.954 --> 12:28.366
Including one way out at Pearl.

12:28.456 --> 12:31.243
All of a sudden,
they start hearing Pavarotti.

12:31.334 --> 12:34.292
-Pavarotti...
-Coming out of their asses.

12:36.839 --> 12:38.830
-What do I do?
-I got it.

12:42.053 --> 12:44.760
Conn, Sonar.
New contact, bearing 0-9-7.

12:44.847 --> 12:47.884
Designate contact number Sierra 3-5.

12:47.976 --> 12:51.810
-Captain, aye. What've you got, Jones?
-Distant contact, probably submerged.

12:51.896 --> 12:53.102
It's a wild guess,

12:53.189 --> 12:56.022
but I'd say we hit a boomer
coming out of the barn.

12:56.109 --> 12:59.317
Could be a missile boat out of Polijarny.

13:00.571 --> 13:02.436
Okay. Start your track.
I'll be there in a minute.

14:04.927 --> 14:07.009
Time to open the orders, sir.

14:08.389 --> 14:12.758
The Political Officer is in your cabin.

14:13.186 --> 14:14.926
Very well.

14:15.063 --> 14:17.725
You have the conn.

14:37.293 --> 14:38.999
What are you doing?

14:39.170 --> 14:44.381
I must oversee
the stability of the crew, Captain.

14:45.968 --> 14:49.301
By invading my privacy?

14:50.098 --> 14:55.343
Privacy is not a major concern
in the Soviet Union, comrade.

14:55.561 --> 14:59.019
It's often contrary to the collective good.

15:03.611 --> 15:07.900
"Behold, I am coming as a thief...

15:07.990 --> 15:11.278
"And they gathered them together

15:12.286 --> 15:16.655
"In a place called...

15:16.749 --> 15:18.330
"Armageddon."

15:18.918 --> 15:22.502
"And the seventh angel
poured forth his bowl into the air,

15:22.588 --> 15:25.500
"and a voice cried out
from heaven, saying,

15:25.591 --> 15:27.957
"'It is done."'

15:29.637 --> 15:34.427
A man with your responsibilities
reading about the end of the world.

15:34.517 --> 15:35.848
And what's this?

15:35.935 --> 15:41.020
"I am become death,
the destroyer of worlds."

15:41.107 --> 15:45.225
It is an ancient Hindu text
quoted by an American.

15:45.319 --> 15:48.607
-American?
-He invented the atomic bomb,

15:48.698 --> 15:51.861
and he was later accused
of being a communist.

15:52.410 --> 15:56.073
You wrote
and underlined these passages?

15:56.164 --> 15:57.574
No.

16:00.877 --> 16:04.790
This book belonged to my wife.
I keep it for sentimental value.

16:04.881 --> 16:08.123
I'm sorry, Comrade Captain.
Your wife was a beautiful woman.

16:08.217 --> 16:10.708
Her death was unfortunate.

16:11.512 --> 16:14.720
I'm only doing myjob.
It is my responsibility.

16:18.644 --> 16:21.807
How many agents
did the KGB put aboard my boat?

16:21.898 --> 16:23.980
-Your boat, Captain?
-Yes.

16:24.066 --> 16:27.558
This vessel belongs
to the people of the Soviet Union.

16:28.070 --> 16:32.530
Besides, if the KGB
or the GRU has agents aboard,

16:32.617 --> 16:34.824
I will be the last to know.

16:37.121 --> 16:39.863
I suggest we open our orders, Captain.

16:41.667 --> 16:43.874
Certainly, comrade.

17:26.295 --> 17:27.751
"From Commander...

17:27.838 --> 17:31.831
"Strategic submarine forces
red banner northern fleet."

17:31.926 --> 17:37.171
We're to proceed north
to grid square reference 54-90

17:37.265 --> 17:41.008
and rendezvous with
Alfa submarine Konovalov.

17:41.102 --> 17:44.890
-Captain Tupolev's boat.
-You know Tupolev?

17:44.981 --> 17:49.395
I know he descends from aristocracy
and that he was your student.

17:50.653 --> 17:53.690
It's rumoured he has a special place
in his heart for you.

17:53.781 --> 17:57.820
There's little room in Tupolev's heart
for anyone but Tupolev.

18:01.247 --> 18:05.035
Having made contact,
we are to run a series of drills.

18:05.126 --> 18:08.118
Tupolev will hunt us
while we test our ship.

18:08.212 --> 18:10.043
Having evaluated
the operational readiness

18:10.131 --> 18:11.246
of the caterpillar drive,

18:11.340 --> 18:15.549
we are to return to Polijarny
on or about the 16th of this month.

18:17.471 --> 18:22.261
Captain, this is an historic moment.
I'd like to make a request.

18:22.351 --> 18:24.888
-Before you proceed, comrade...
-I know it's not protocol,

18:24.979 --> 18:26.765
but would you permit me
to post our orders

18:26.856 --> 18:29.689
and inform the crew of our mission?

18:54.759 --> 18:58.251
Where I'm going, you cannot follow.

19:27.416 --> 19:31.000
Dr Petrov, report
to my cabin immediately.

19:31.087 --> 19:33.999
There's been a dreadful accident.

20:03.786 --> 20:05.322
Buddy!

20:13.462 --> 20:17.046
Daniel, got any more rods? More rods!

20:17.133 --> 20:20.341
Listen to me.
There's no cradle underneath it.

20:20.428 --> 20:23.795
-Get it over.
-Relax! Stop being an old maid.

20:23.889 --> 20:26.050
You want to come up here
and do it yourself?

20:26.142 --> 20:29.100
-All right. Bring her up.
-What? What?

20:30.312 --> 20:31.643
Ryan I

20:32.273 --> 20:33.888
Who let you in here?

20:33.983 --> 20:38.147
Skip, what, have they
got you playing with models now?

20:38.654 --> 20:42.067
Damn it, Bill! Tell them to slow down!

20:42.158 --> 20:45.400
I'm doing it. I'm doing it.
Slow it down, will you?

20:45.494 --> 20:49.988
It's not a model.
The DSRV. Rescue sub.

20:50.082 --> 20:53.245
I know what it is.
What are you doing with it?

20:53.335 --> 20:55.826
We're rigging it
with a generic docking collar

20:55.921 --> 20:59.163
so it'll mate with British, German...
Just about anybody's sub.

20:59.258 --> 21:02.466
We can get it
anywhere in the world in 24 hours.

21:04.513 --> 21:06.674
-How's your back?
-It's fine.

21:08.100 --> 21:10.091
Have you got a minute?

21:12.354 --> 21:14.640
Bigger than a regular Typhoon.

21:15.524 --> 21:19.483
-What are these doors?
-You don't miss much, do you?

21:19.570 --> 21:22.403
Those are too big to be torpedo tubes.

21:24.074 --> 21:26.486
Would you launch an ICBM horizontally?

21:26.577 --> 21:30.320
Sure. Why would you want to?
They're symmetrical.

21:31.916 --> 21:34.908
Right down the long axis of the sub.

21:35.002 --> 21:39.541
-How about a towed sonar array?
-Nope. Too close to the screws.

21:39.632 --> 21:41.293
I'll be...

21:43.469 --> 21:46.051
This... This could be a caterpillar.

21:46.138 --> 21:49.005
-A what?
-A caterpillar drive.

21:49.099 --> 21:51.761
Magneto-hydrodynamic propulsion.

21:51.852 --> 21:53.808
-You follow?
-No.

21:54.605 --> 21:57.813
It's like a jet engine for the water.

21:57.900 --> 22:00.107
Goes in the front,
gets squirted out the back.

22:00.194 --> 22:03.982
Only it's got no moving parts,
so it's very, very quiet.

22:04.073 --> 22:05.734
Like how quiet?

22:06.408 --> 22:08.524
It's doubtful our sonar
would even pick it up.

22:08.619 --> 22:09.825
And if it did,

22:09.912 --> 22:13.621
it would sound like whales humping
or a seismic anomaly.

22:13.707 --> 22:15.743
Anything but a submarine.

22:16.293 --> 22:18.705
We messed with this
a couple of years ago.

22:18.796 --> 22:21.128
Couldn't make it work.

22:22.216 --> 22:25.708
They really built this?
This isn't a mock-up or anything?

22:25.803 --> 22:28.215
She put to sea this morning.

22:34.061 --> 22:35.676
When lwas 12,

22:35.771 --> 22:38.183
I helped my daddy
build a bomb shelter in our basement

22:38.274 --> 22:40.560
because some fool
parked a dozen warheads

22:40.651 --> 22:43.814
90 miles off the coast of Florida.

22:44.572 --> 22:47.359
This thing could park
a couple of hundred warheads

22:47.449 --> 22:48.939
off Washington and New York,

22:49.034 --> 22:52.868
and no one would know
anything about it until it was all over.

23:05.009 --> 23:08.046
-Are you all right, Captain?
-Yes.

23:08.137 --> 23:12.927
It's just to die for something
as petty as slipping on tea.

23:13.017 --> 23:15.850
You're blaming yourself, Captain.
It was an accident.

23:15.936 --> 23:18.848
-You'll feel better when we put in.
-Put in?

23:18.939 --> 23:20.645
To base, Captain.

23:21.275 --> 23:23.391
We cannot
go on without a political officer.

23:23.485 --> 23:26.568
Doctor, this is a combat vessel
of the Soviet Navy,

23:26.655 --> 23:28.987
and I'm a senior combat officer.

23:29.074 --> 23:32.987
We do not cancel operations
because of accidents.

23:34.455 --> 23:36.821
Seaman, come here.

23:38.667 --> 23:40.248
Come here.

23:41.211 --> 23:44.669
-Your name?
-Cook's Assistant Loginov, sir.

23:44.757 --> 23:48.341
Good. I want you and the doctor
to witness this.

23:49.637 --> 23:53.095
I'm removing
the political officer's missile key...

23:53.182 --> 23:57.425
Carry on. And I'm keeping it myself.

23:57.519 --> 24:00.431
Captain, I think we should report this
to Red Fleet Command.

24:00.522 --> 24:04.481
I'm afraid that's impossible, Doctor.
Our orders are for strict radio silence.

24:04.568 --> 24:06.399
Orders, sir.

24:06.487 --> 24:08.443
-That's all, Loginov.
-Yes, sir.

24:08.530 --> 24:11.442
This is most unnerving, Captain.

24:12.117 --> 24:15.234
The reason for having two missile keys

24:15.329 --> 24:19.823
is so that no one man may...

24:19.917 --> 24:21.657
May what?

24:22.878 --> 24:26.245
May arm the missiles.
Perhaps I should keep the key.

24:26.340 --> 24:29.082
-Thank you. That'll be all, Doctor.
-Captain, I...

24:29.176 --> 24:33.215
When I address the crew,
then you will understand.

24:34.264 --> 24:35.925
Yes, sir.

24:38.394 --> 24:40.385
-Petrov.
-Yes, sir?

24:40.938 --> 24:45.853
I will try to forget your comments
when I present my report.

24:45.943 --> 24:48.059
Thank you, sir.

24:52.658 --> 24:56.651
Holding steady on 3-1-0.

24:56.745 --> 24:59.327
Twelve knots at about 20,000 yards.

24:59.415 --> 25:02.578
-Have you got a make on him?
-Computer's chewing on it, sir.

25:02.668 --> 25:06.877
Twin screws.
The plant noise sounds like a Typhoon.

25:16.473 --> 25:18.259
I'd say we got a new boat, sir.

25:18.350 --> 25:21.012
Tommy, I miss
something on the boards?

25:21.103 --> 25:23.890
Sub plant hasn't said anything about it.

25:26.859 --> 25:28.190
All right.

25:28.277 --> 25:29.858
How many Typhoons
we got in the computer?

25:29.945 --> 25:33.904
-Six, sir.
-Okay. Call this guy Typhoon 7.

25:33.991 --> 25:36.698
Start a tape on him.
See if we can work in a little closer.

25:36.785 --> 25:38.491
Yes, sir.

25:39.204 --> 25:40.694
Won't he hear us?

25:40.789 --> 25:43.121
Not if we stay
in his baffles, Seaman Beaumont.

25:43.208 --> 25:45.870
Not if we stay in his baffles.

25:45.961 --> 25:49.795
Come in behind his propeller,
and he's deaf as a post.

26:18.368 --> 26:21.235
Any sonar contacts, Mr Kamarov?

26:21.330 --> 26:23.742
No contacts, Captain.
The sonar is clear.

26:23.832 --> 26:27.199
Good. Do we have
any surface contacts, Mr Borodin?

26:27.294 --> 26:29.626
-No contacts, sir. Scope is clear.
-Good.

26:29.713 --> 26:33.046
Then it is time
I explain our orders to the crew.

26:35.052 --> 26:37.885
Comrades, this is your captain.

26:38.639 --> 26:40.721
It is an honour to speak to you today,

26:40.808 --> 26:43.766
and I 'm honoured to be sailing with you
on the maiden voyage

26:43.852 --> 26:46.935
of our motherland’s
most recent achievement.

26:47.022 --> 26:51.766
And once more,
we play our dangerous game,

26:51.860 --> 26:53.600
a game of chess,

26:53.695 --> 26:57.688
against our old adversary,
the American Navy.

26:58.617 --> 27:00.107
For 40 years,

27:00.202 --> 27:02.784
your fathers before you
and your older brothers

27:02.871 --> 27:05.237
played this game and played it well.

27:05.332 --> 27:10.247
But today, the game is different.
We have the advantage.

27:10.337 --> 27:14.922
It reminds me of the heady days
of Sputnik and Yuri Gagarin,

27:15.008 --> 27:18.250
when the world trembled
at the sound of our rockets.

27:18.345 --> 27:22.304
They will tremble again
at the sound of our silence.

27:22.391 --> 27:26.634
-The order is engage for silent drive.
-Aye, sir.

27:26.728 --> 27:30.471
-Ballast control, open outer doors.
-Yes, open outer doors.

27:30.566 --> 27:31.772
Diving command.

27:31.859 --> 27:34.942
Engage caterpillar
and secure main engines.

27:39.199 --> 27:40.609
Doors opening, Captain.

27:40.701 --> 27:45.161
Comrades, our own fleet
doesn't know our full potential.

27:45.247 --> 27:47.909
They will do
everything possible to test us,

27:48.000 --> 27:50.992
but they will only test
their own embarrassment.

27:51.086 --> 27:53.327
We will leave our fleet behind.

27:53.422 --> 27:55.788
We will pass through
the American patrols,

27:55.883 --> 27:57.839
pass their sonar nets,

27:57.926 --> 28:03.421
and lay off their largest city
and listen to their rock 'n' roll

28:03.515 --> 28:06.507
while we conduct missile drills.

28:06.602 --> 28:08.433
Then...

28:08.979 --> 28:10.935
And when we are finished,

28:11.023 --> 28:14.356
the only sound they will hear
is our laughter

28:14.443 --> 28:16.183
while we sail to Havana,

28:16.278 --> 28:19.770
where the sun is warm
and so is the comradeship.

28:21.783 --> 28:23.694
Cryogenic plant
coming on line, Captain.

28:23.785 --> 28:28.449
A great day, comrades.
We sail into history.

28:34.963 --> 28:37.295
Caterpillar engaging.

28:39.509 --> 28:42.922
Caterpillar engaging, Captain.

28:56.318 --> 28:59.105
-What happened?
-I don't know.

29:26.014 --> 29:28.756
-Full rudder left.
-Full rudder left.

29:28.850 --> 29:32.263
Navigator. New course, 2-5-0.

29:32.354 --> 29:35.596
-Yes, new course, 2-5-0.
-Steering 2-5-0.

29:35.691 --> 29:38.273
Yes, course is 2-5-0.

30:08.598 --> 30:12.967
Sonar contact, Captain.
Port quarter. Close aboard.

30:13.061 --> 30:15.677
American, Los Angeles class.

30:16.315 --> 30:20.604
-American. Captain, we...
-Course 3-1-0.

30:20.694 --> 30:25.734
-Is the American turning to follow us?
-No, Captain.

30:26.325 --> 30:28.737
The American is continuing
in his original course.

30:28.827 --> 30:32.240
-He's continuing northwest.
-He can't hear us.

30:32.331 --> 30:34.913
And the singing?

30:48.638 --> 30:50.879
Let them sing.

31:09.868 --> 31:11.358
What are you talking about?
Check your gear.

31:11.453 --> 31:13.944
Running diagnostics now, Captain.

31:20.962 --> 31:24.204
Sonar is working, Captain.
The Russian disappeared.

31:24.299 --> 31:27.291
One minute, he was steady
4,000 yards off the bow,

31:27.386 --> 31:31.720
and then he was gone,
and for a second, I thought I heard...

31:32.974 --> 31:37.638
-Heard what?
-I thought I heard singing, sir.

31:39.022 --> 31:41.434
-Singing?
-Yes, sir.

32:09.845 --> 32:14.179
Good morning, sir.
I hope we had a lovely evening.

32:14.266 --> 32:16.882
A little chilly this morning.

32:40.584 --> 32:44.668
There's a letter there
from Marko Ramius.

32:45.839 --> 32:48.171
Marko.

33:19.080 --> 33:20.195
Yes?

33:21.249 --> 33:23.956
No. This is Dr Ryan.

33:27.422 --> 33:28.582
What the hell happened?

33:28.673 --> 33:30.288
Come on. This is no longer

33:30.634 --> 33:32.340
a research project.

33:36.264 --> 33:38.630
I got a line on those doors.

33:40.435 --> 33:43.177
You know what they are?

33:44.856 --> 33:49.190
-A nearly silent propulsion system?
-How did you know that?

33:49.277 --> 33:52.144
The captain of the sub
following her radioed in.

33:52.239 --> 33:57.029
Thing disappeared right in front of him,
and that's only the half of it.

33:57.118 --> 33:58.824
Read.

34:05.460 --> 34:07.496
I'm sorry.

34:08.338 --> 34:11.455
-Got your ID?
-My God, this is unbelievable.

34:11.550 --> 34:16.385
The Kirov, three Sverdlovsk,
the Kiev, the Minsk.

34:16.471 --> 34:18.336
They've sortied their whole bloody fleet.

34:18.431 --> 34:19.637
That's about the size of it.

34:19.724 --> 34:22.807
-Good afternoon, Admiral.
-Afternoon, Matthew.

34:23.228 --> 34:24.593
Where are we going, anyway?

34:24.688 --> 34:29.148
Briefing for Jeffrey Pelt,
President's National Security Adviser.

34:29.234 --> 34:34.024
Most of the Joint Chiefs will be there,
along with a few other people.

34:34.114 --> 34:37.948
-Who's giving the briefing?
-You are.

34:38.034 --> 34:40.446
The yeoman will have all the slides
laid out for you.

34:40.537 --> 34:42.994
So all you got to do...

34:48.670 --> 34:53.915
Look, no one understands
this material better than you.

34:54.009 --> 34:58.173
Just give him a rundown on the sub
and a précis of the stuff in your hand.

34:58.263 --> 35:00.754
He's liable
to ask some direct questions.

35:00.849 --> 35:04.091
Give him direct answers.
Tell him what you think.

35:05.020 --> 35:06.635
Come on.

35:12.527 --> 35:15.394
Gentlemen, the last 24 hours have seen

35:15.488 --> 35:19.322
some extraordinary
Soviet Naval activity.

35:19.409 --> 35:23.322
The first to sail was this ship,
we believe called the Red October

35:23.413 --> 35:27.122
in reference
to the October Revolution of 1917.

35:27.208 --> 35:31.121
A variant of the Typhoon class,
she's some 650 feet long

35:31.212 --> 35:33.703
and 32,000 tons
submerged displacement,

35:33.798 --> 35:38.132
roughly the same size
as a World War II aircraft carrier.

35:38.219 --> 35:42.462
We believe that these doors,
here on the bow and again on the stern,

35:42.557 --> 35:44.969
enclose a unique propulsion system,

35:45.060 --> 35:48.518
a magneto-hydrodynamic drive,
or caterpillar,

35:48.605 --> 35:52.063
that would enable
the sub to run virtually silent.

35:52.651 --> 35:54.482
It is possible that this new drive system

35:54.569 --> 35:56.560
allowed the captain,
a man named Ramius,

35:56.655 --> 35:58.691
their senior and perhaps
most respected commander...

35:58.782 --> 36:00.693
Do we have his picture available?

36:00.784 --> 36:04.322
Allowed Ramius to elude
one of our attack boats, the Dallas,

36:04.412 --> 36:07.745
which trailed Red October
from harbour this morning.

36:09.793 --> 36:13.456
It is also possible
that this drive system, if operable,

36:14.422 --> 36:15.582
could render the Red October

36:15.674 --> 36:19.258
undetectable to our SOSUS
warning nets in the Atlantic.

36:19.344 --> 36:23.337
Mr Ryan, would you characterise this
as a first-strike weapon?

36:27.268 --> 36:29.509
That is a possibility, sir.

36:29.938 --> 36:32.054
It is designed to approach by stealth

36:32.148 --> 36:34.685
and to shower its target
with multiple independent warheads

36:34.776 --> 36:38.109
with little or no warning before impact.

36:38.196 --> 36:41.438
Goddamn thing's made to start a war.

36:41.533 --> 36:43.694
Proceed, Mr Ryan.

36:43.785 --> 36:46.242
About the same time
the Dallas lost contact,

36:46.329 --> 36:50.368
there were additional sailings from
Polijarny and from Leningrad

36:50.458 --> 36:53.370
on the Baltic
and from the Mediterranean.

36:53.461 --> 36:55.793
There are now
some 58 nuclear submarines

36:55.880 --> 36:58.542
headed at high speed into the Atlantic.

36:58.633 --> 37:02.217
This afternoon a satellite pass
over Polijarny found heat blooms

37:02.303 --> 37:04.715
in the engineering plants
of the Kirov, the Minsk,

37:04.806 --> 37:06.842
and more than 20 other
cruisers and destroyers,

37:06.933 --> 37:09.219
indicating they were preparing to sail.

37:09.310 --> 37:12.723
This constitutes the bulk
of the Soviet surface fleet.

37:12.814 --> 37:15.226
Admiral Greer, your conclusions.

37:15.316 --> 37:18.900
Sir, the data support
no conclusions as yet.

37:18.987 --> 37:24.482
The absence of activity in the Pacific
suggests this could bejust an exercise.

37:25.493 --> 37:28.155
-It may have nothing to do...
-Suppose it's not an exercise?

37:28.246 --> 37:31.033
Suppose this is the beginning
of a move against NATO?

37:31.124 --> 37:33.490
NSA can speak for that, Mr Pelt.

37:33.585 --> 37:36.577
I must emphasise the extreme
sensitivity of this information

37:36.671 --> 37:38.332
and that it not leave the room.

37:38.423 --> 37:42.917
Before sailing, Captain Ramius
sent a letter to Admiral Yuri Padorin,

37:43.011 --> 37:46.629
Chairman of the Red Fleet
Northern Political Directorate.

37:46.723 --> 37:49.590
-That's her uncle.
-Whose uncle?

37:49.684 --> 37:53.017
Ramius' wife. Padorin's her uncle.

37:53.521 --> 37:57.309
Now, the contents
of the letter are unknown,

37:57.400 --> 37:59.812
but Admiral Padorin
immediately demanded

37:59.903 --> 38:04.863
a meeting with Premier Chernenko,
and within minutes of that meeting,

38:04.949 --> 38:09.363
the Soviet fleet sailed with orders
to find Red October and sink her.

38:11.915 --> 38:12.950
Sink her?

38:13.041 --> 38:15.623
My God.
They've got a madman on their hands.

38:15.710 --> 38:17.792
If it gets within 500 miles of the coast,

38:17.879 --> 38:21.838
we'll have
less than two minutes' warning.

38:36.397 --> 38:38.353
-Today's the 23rd, isn't it?
-What?

38:38.441 --> 38:40.898
-Is today the 23rd?
-Yeah.

38:51.746 --> 38:54.579
You son of a bitch.

38:55.375 --> 38:58.037
You son of a bitch!

39:01.047 --> 39:04.665
You wish to add something
to our discussion, Dr Ryan?

39:10.515 --> 39:11.550
Sir, lwasjust thinking

39:11.641 --> 39:15.680
that perhaps there's
another possibility we might consider.

39:17.146 --> 39:19.353
Ramius might be trying to defect.

39:19.440 --> 39:21.180
Do you mean to suggest
that this man has come...

39:21.276 --> 39:23.483
Proceed, Mr Ryan.

39:29.117 --> 39:32.280
Ramius trained most
of their officer corps,

39:32.370 --> 39:36.363
which would put him in a position
to select men willing to help him.

39:36.457 --> 39:39.039
And he's not Russian.

39:39.127 --> 39:43.461
He's Lithuanian by birth, raised by
his paternal grandfather, a fisherman.

39:44.507 --> 39:47.795
And he has no children,
no ties to leave behind.

39:50.680 --> 39:54.719
And today is the first anniversary
of his wife's death.

39:54.809 --> 39:58.893
Come on. You're just an analyst.
How can you read his mind?

39:58.980 --> 40:01.096
I know Ramius, General.

40:01.941 --> 40:04.683
He's nearly a legend
in the submarine community.

40:04.777 --> 40:06.233
He's been a maverick his entire career.

40:06.321 --> 40:08.687
I actually met him once
at an embassy dinner.

40:08.781 --> 40:12.490
Have you ever met
Captain Ramius, General?

40:20.168 --> 40:21.658
Admiral Hollis,

40:22.378 --> 40:27.247
how long before Ramius could be
in a position to fire his missiles at us?

40:27.342 --> 40:29.082
Four days.

40:29.177 --> 40:33.386
All right. I'll brief the President.
That will be all, gentlemen.

40:33.473 --> 40:37.512
Dr Ryan,
would you stay for a moment, please?

40:38.603 --> 40:41.686
I said speak your mind,
Jack, but Jesus...

40:54.410 --> 40:57.618
You slammed the door
on the general pretty hard, Jack.

40:57.705 --> 41:01.197
-That was not my intention, sir.
-Yes, it was.

41:01.292 --> 41:03.999
He was patronising you,
and you stomped on him.

41:04.087 --> 41:06.578
In my opinion, he deserved it.

41:07.173 --> 41:12.213
Listen, I'm a politician,
which means I'm a cheat and a liar,

41:12.303 --> 41:15.921
and when I'm not kissing babies,
I'm stealing their Iollipops,

41:16.015 --> 41:19.803
but it also means
that I keep my options open.

41:21.396 --> 41:26.060
So let's assume for a minute
that you're right

41:27.527 --> 41:31.019
and this Russian intends to defect.

41:31.823 --> 41:34.530
What do you suggest we do about it?

41:36.160 --> 41:39.869
-We definitely grab the boat, sir.
-Wait a minute.

41:39.956 --> 41:43.119
We're not talking
about some stray pilot with a MIG.

41:43.209 --> 41:44.164
We're talking about

41:44.252 --> 41:47.540
several billion dollars' worth
of Soviet state property.

41:48.089 --> 41:50.000
They're going to want it back.

41:50.091 --> 41:51.206
Maybe it's enough then

41:51.300 --> 41:53.541
just to get some people onboard
and inspect it.

41:53.636 --> 41:57.845
Call it whatever you want to...
A coast guard safety inspection.

41:57.932 --> 42:00.594
So how do we proceed?

42:01.561 --> 42:05.145
First, we need to contact
the commanders in the Atlantic directly.

42:05.231 --> 42:06.721
The Russians get one whiff of this

42:06.816 --> 42:08.272
through the regular
communications circuits,

42:08.359 --> 42:09.940
the game is up.

42:10.028 --> 42:12.986
Second, we figure out
how we can help them.

42:13.072 --> 42:17.691
We devise a plan to intercede,
ready to go at a moment's notice.

42:17.785 --> 42:21.744
Third, somebody's
got to go make contact with Ramius

42:21.831 --> 42:24.288
and find out
what his intentions really are.

42:24.375 --> 42:26.536
Okay. When do you leave?

42:28.212 --> 42:29.702
Wait a minute.

42:32.592 --> 42:33.752
The general was right.

42:33.843 --> 42:35.959
I am not field personnel.
I am only an analyst.

42:36.054 --> 42:37.214
You're perfect.

42:37.305 --> 42:39.261
I can't ask
any of these characters to go.

42:39.348 --> 42:40.804
They don't believe in it.

42:40.892 --> 42:43.884
They'd never stake their reputation
on a hunch, whereas you...

42:43.978 --> 42:45.969
Are expendable.

42:48.649 --> 42:50.810
Something like that.

42:54.072 --> 42:57.564
I'll give you three days
to prove your theory correct.

42:57.658 --> 43:02.402
After that, I have to hunt down Ramius
and destroy him.

43:02.497 --> 43:04.078
Will you do it?

43:21.099 --> 43:24.262
Mother of God! Secure the mast!

43:24.352 --> 43:26.764
All ahead, two-thirds!
Set depth to 900 metres!

43:26.854 --> 43:30.642
-What is it? What's happened?
-Mast secured, helm at two-thirds.

43:33.444 --> 43:37.983
-Commence heading 2-0-5.
-2-0-5, affirmative.

43:51.337 --> 43:54.750
These orders
are seven bloody hours old!

43:54.841 --> 43:58.004
Sitting on the bottom
like an addled schoolboy.

43:58.094 --> 43:59.379
-Captain. ..
-Passing at...

43:59.470 --> 44:01.631
-Al| ahead, flank.
-All ahead, flank.

44:01.722 --> 44:03.258
Inquire of the engineer
about the possibility

44:03.349 --> 44:06.261
of going to 105% on the reactor.

44:07.562 --> 44:12.226
Seven hours.
The entire fleet is after him.

44:20.992 --> 44:23.608
-Leve||ing at 900 metres.
-Very well.

44:23.703 --> 44:28.322
Captain, engineer reports
105% on the reactor possible,

44:28.416 --> 44:30.577
but not recommended.

44:41.137 --> 44:43.423
Go to 105 on the reactor.

44:46.559 --> 44:49.676
Captain, what is it?
Where are we going?

44:49.770 --> 44:52.682
We're going to kill a friend, Yevgeni.

44:53.441 --> 44:55.682
We're going to kill Ramius.

45:17.340 --> 45:21.709
If you like borscht, perhaps,
but I've eaten better in an oiler's galley.

45:21.802 --> 45:23.338
My wife said to the waiter,

45:23.429 --> 45:27.217
"Where did this man
learn to cook, Afghanistan?"

45:27.308 --> 45:30.175
So then we went on
to the Bolshoi, the ballet,

45:30.269 --> 45:33.727
to see this new girl as Giselle.
You remember how beautiful she was.

45:33.814 --> 45:37.432
-She just married a factory manager.
-Excuse me, Doctor.

45:39.237 --> 45:43.321
Do you have the figures
for the latest batch of radiation tests?

45:43.407 --> 45:46.114
-Now?
-Now.

45:48.829 --> 45:52.742
Perhaps you could bring
the preceding set as well

45:52.833 --> 45:54.789
for comparison.

45:55.461 --> 45:57.577
Thank you, Doctor.

46:14.855 --> 46:17.096
It will take him some time.

46:19.360 --> 46:21.476
Before we begin, Captain,

46:21.570 --> 46:25.563
I'd like to know
exactly what happened to Putin.

46:30.246 --> 46:32.862
He didn't slip on his tea, did he?

46:34.250 --> 46:36.286
I don't think I like your tone, Slavin.

46:36.377 --> 46:38.789
What the hell's
my tone got to do with it?

46:38.879 --> 46:43.794
-We're risking our lives here.
-Putin could've caused complications.

46:43.884 --> 46:45.294
Did you think
he would just go away and sulk

46:45.386 --> 46:47.798
while we carried out our plans?

46:47.888 --> 46:50.550
Are you saying he was murdered?

46:51.392 --> 46:53.474
-My God.
-Stop whining, Yuri.

46:53.561 --> 46:57.474
-How can you justify murder?
-So he was murdered.

46:57.565 --> 46:58.850
The man was a pig,

46:58.941 --> 47:01.557
but it's a decision
we should've all made together.

47:01.652 --> 47:03.017
You are not in command here.

47:03.112 --> 47:05.945
If the crew finds out,
we could have a mutiny.

47:09.160 --> 47:12.197
Everything that
happens on this ship affects us all.

47:12.288 --> 47:14.529
The Master-at—Arms
is already suspicious.

47:14.623 --> 47:18.161
-We could still go back.
-There will be no going back.

47:21.422 --> 47:26.382
Before we sailed,
I dispatched a letter to Admiral Padorin,

47:26.927 --> 47:30.294
in which I announced
our intention to defect.

47:32.641 --> 47:35.474
In the name of God, why?

47:36.395 --> 47:40.729
When he reached the New World,
Cortez burned his ships.

47:40.816 --> 47:44.434
As a result,
his men were well motivated.

47:44.528 --> 47:46.940
You have signed our death warrants.

47:47.031 --> 47:51.365
-Padorin will send the entire fleet.
-Jesus, they'll find us.

47:51.452 --> 47:52.567
They'll find us and...

47:52.661 --> 47:55.778
No one's going to find us.
That's enough, Yuri.

47:57.249 --> 47:59.160
You had to do it,

47:59.752 --> 48:02.869
you couldn'tjust turn the submarine
over to the Americans.

48:02.963 --> 48:05.875
You had to make a political statement.

48:06.675 --> 48:10.418
Or was it something deeper, Captain,

48:10.513 --> 48:14.426
something that made you
unable to slip away?

48:14.517 --> 48:20.137
-Was it ego, Captain?
-We each have our reasons, Victor.

48:20.606 --> 48:25.066
My own began the day I was handed
the blueprints for this ship,

48:25.152 --> 48:28.360
a ship which had but one use.

48:28.447 --> 48:29.903
And as for the rest,

48:29.990 --> 48:33.824
those are things
that I alone must carry the burden for.

48:35.955 --> 48:38.992
Anatoli, you're afraid of our fleet.

48:40.334 --> 48:41.744
You should be.

48:41.836 --> 48:45.454
Personally,
I give us one chance in three.

48:50.177 --> 48:52.088
More tea, anyone?

48:55.516 --> 48:57.006
No?

48:58.352 --> 49:01.185
Then you may report back to your posts.

49:17.913 --> 49:20.495
You heard the Captain. Dismissed.

49:29.925 --> 49:31.631
Captain.

49:43.522 --> 49:46.184
Captain, Iwould never
disagree with you in front of the men,

49:46.275 --> 49:47.856
you know that.

49:49.111 --> 49:52.069
But in this case, Victor is right.

49:53.199 --> 49:56.862
It would've been better
if you had not informed Moscow.

49:56.952 --> 49:58.863
Vasily.

49:58.954 --> 50:03.823
Moscow is not the worry,
nor the whole Soviet navy.

50:03.918 --> 50:08.252
I know their tactics.
I have the advantage.

50:10.257 --> 50:11.838
No.

50:12.551 --> 50:15.258
The worry is the Americans.

50:16.430 --> 50:21.094
If we meet the right sort, this will work.

50:23.938 --> 50:27.226
We get some buckaroo...

50:32.446 --> 50:38.407
Some turbulence, Commander?
You don't like flying. This is nothing!

50:38.494 --> 50:40.951
You should've been with us
five, six months ago!

50:41.038 --> 50:43.029
You talk about puke!

50:43.123 --> 50:46.365
We ran into a hailstorm
over the Sea of Japan, right?

50:46.460 --> 50:48.451
Everybody's retching their guts out!

50:48.546 --> 50:51.333
The pilot shot his lunch
all over the windshield,

50:51.423 --> 50:53.539
and I barf on the radio!

50:53.634 --> 50:55.295
Knocked it out completely,

50:55.386 --> 50:57.217
and it wasn't
that lightweight stuff either!

50:57.304 --> 51:00.046
It was that chunky,
industrial-weight puke!

51:00.140 --> 51:01.596
You want a bite?

51:03.686 --> 51:07.474
Jack, next time you get a bright idea,
just put it in a memo.

51:16.490 --> 51:17.821
Sir.

51:18.993 --> 51:21.609
That'll be all, Lieutenant. Thank you.

51:21.704 --> 51:23.740
That hawkeye from Weymouth Trap?

51:23.831 --> 51:26.698
Four wire.
Caught a gust over the fantail.

51:26.792 --> 51:28.578
Not bad, considering.

51:28.669 --> 51:31.911
-The gentleman is here to see you.
-The gentleman?

51:32.006 --> 51:34.793
What the hell
you talking about, Charlie?

51:34.883 --> 51:36.714
I apologise for the uniform, sir.

51:36.802 --> 51:39.919
This is Admiral Greer's idea
of a low profile.

51:40.014 --> 51:43.723
-You work for Jim Greer?
-That's right, sir.

51:43.809 --> 51:47.677
Then I imagine you'll tell me
what all the hubbub's about.

51:48.772 --> 51:51.354
Captain, you got a minute?

51:52.276 --> 51:54.688
Jonesy's got something
I think you ought to see.

51:54.778 --> 51:56.769
Martinez, get yourself a cup of coffee.

51:56.864 --> 51:59.571
-Send me up some tea.
-Aye, Captain.

52:00.367 --> 52:03.279
Messenger, get the captain a cup of tea.

52:05.372 --> 52:07.328
Captain.

52:08.208 --> 52:12.952
Sir, the moment that sub went silent
and I thought I heard some singing,

52:13.047 --> 52:15.208
I heard something
in the background real faint.

52:15.299 --> 52:19.884
After all those subs took off,
I caught it again and got it on tape.

52:19.970 --> 52:24.213
I washed it through the computer
and was able to isolate this sound.

52:28.062 --> 52:30.053
When I asked
the computer to identify it,

52:30.147 --> 52:32.980
what I got was magma displacement.

52:33.067 --> 52:35.524
You see, sir, the SAPS software

52:35.611 --> 52:38.227
was originally
written to look for seismic events.

52:38.322 --> 52:42.235
I think when it gets confused,
it kind of runs home to mama.

52:42.326 --> 52:45.614
-I'm not following you, Jonesy.
-Sir, I'm sorry.

52:45.704 --> 52:48.912
Listen to it at 10 times speed.

52:56.423 --> 52:59.130
Now, that's
got to be manmade, Captain.

52:59.468 --> 53:00.958
All right.

53:02.763 --> 53:07.052
The first contact was at 09:15,
and the bearing was 2-6-9.

53:07.142 --> 53:08.507
At 09:30, it was here.

53:08.602 --> 53:12.595
I came back to it at 11:00 and 11:15,
here and here.

53:13.399 --> 53:16.232
Remember the dispatch we got
about Russian sub skippers

53:16.318 --> 53:18.525
running the Reykjanes Ridge
at high speeds

53:18.612 --> 53:21.820
because they had hyper-accurate
surveys of the underwater canyons?

53:21.907 --> 53:26.367
The front door to those canyons
was a formation called Thor's Twins.

53:26.453 --> 53:27.989
Yeah?

53:41.218 --> 53:42.879
Look at that.

53:44.638 --> 53:47.129
-Right into Red Route One.
-Captain.

53:49.017 --> 53:50.052
You may think I'm crazy,

53:50.144 --> 53:55.059
but I'll bet that magma displacement
was actually some new Russian sub,

53:55.149 --> 53:57.811
and it's headed for the Iceland coast.

53:59.695 --> 54:02.277
Have I got this straight, Jonesy?

54:02.364 --> 54:05.902
A $40 million computer
tells you you're chasing an earthquake,

54:05.993 --> 54:10.077
but you don't believe it,
and you come up with this on your own?

54:11.165 --> 54:13.907
-Yes, sir.
-Including all the navigation math?

54:14.001 --> 54:17.459
-Sir, I've got all the...
-Relax, Jonesy. You sold me.

54:18.464 --> 54:22.457
Tommy, Iwant you
to plot us a speed course

54:22.551 --> 54:25.588
for the bottom end of Red Route One.

54:25.679 --> 54:29.922
We'll never find him in those canyons.
First take us to periscope depth.

54:30.017 --> 54:33.350
-This we got to phone in.
-Aye, aye, Captain.

54:42.070 --> 54:44.356
Hang on, Jonesy.

54:48.410 --> 54:52.824
If I can get you close enough,
can you track this sucker?

54:53.582 --> 54:55.618
Yes, sir.

54:55.709 --> 54:58.917
Now that I know what to listen for,
I'll bag him.

55:00.547 --> 55:02.879
-Carry on.
-Yes, sir.

55:04.510 --> 55:06.842
That's the craziest notion
I've ever heard.

55:06.929 --> 55:10.842
A serving line officer?
An entire ballistic missile submarine?

55:10.933 --> 55:12.343
They can't all want to defect.

55:12.434 --> 55:15.141
Even if it's only the officers,
it's extremely difficult to believe.

55:15.229 --> 55:17.811
-What's his plan?
-His plan?

55:19.274 --> 55:22.437
Russians don't take a dump, son,
without a plan.

55:22.528 --> 55:24.894
Senior captains don't start
something this dangerous

55:24.988 --> 55:26.603
without having thought
the matter through.

55:26.698 --> 55:27.778
What's he going to do,

55:27.866 --> 55:30.073
sail into New York,
pop the hatch, and say here I am?

55:30.160 --> 55:32.071
It might be just that simple, yes.

55:32.162 --> 55:35.154
Things may appear simple
in the cubicle at CIA,

55:35.249 --> 55:36.659
but in the middle of the Atlantic

55:36.750 --> 55:39.332
with Soviet warships
bearing down on us,

55:39.419 --> 55:40.499
they get more complex.

55:40.587 --> 55:43.499
-Smoke?
-No, thank you.

55:44.508 --> 55:46.920
And I don't think your notion
of a few days' inspection

55:47.010 --> 55:48.841
is going to wash either.

55:48.929 --> 55:52.296
In order to be of any value,
you'd have to tear it apart.

55:52.391 --> 55:54.302
The metallurgy would
take a couple of months.

55:54.393 --> 55:59.057
-Then we'd have to keep it.
-What will you do with the crew?

55:59.147 --> 56:03.140
Ones that don't defect
will go back and say we got the boat.

56:03.235 --> 56:06.352
Or do you plan to eliminate them?

56:07.573 --> 56:09.313
We're not at war, sir.

56:09.408 --> 56:13.196
So you have to get
them off the boat in such a way

56:13.287 --> 56:15.027
that they think we don't have it,

56:15.122 --> 56:18.865
and they'll report
that we don't have it to their bosses.

56:18.959 --> 56:22.668
Otherwise, this whole business
isjust academic, right?

56:24.256 --> 56:26.998
Yes, sir. I think I see your point.

56:29.428 --> 56:31.794
When's the last time you slept?

56:32.931 --> 56:34.796
A while.

56:35.684 --> 56:39.176
-The chief outside will fix you up.
-Thank you, sir.

56:40.147 --> 56:42.012
Captain.

56:46.403 --> 56:50.442
It'll be dawn in a couple of hours.
We'll be in the CIC.

56:50.532 --> 56:53.899
Things are liable
to get a little dicey around here.

56:54.703 --> 56:56.284
Yes, sir.

57:04.087 --> 57:07.579
-You think he's crazy?
-Certifiable.

57:07.674 --> 57:12.088
No matter what his credentials,
I don't care for him wearing the uniform.

57:12.179 --> 57:15.012
Did you see that ring on his finger?

57:15.098 --> 57:18.590
-The academy, class of '72. A Marine.
-You're kidding.

57:18.685 --> 57:20.971
-How did you...
-Greer told me.

57:21.063 --> 57:25.306
Summer of his third year,
he went down in a chopper accident.

57:25.400 --> 57:27.766
Bad. Pilot and crew killed.

57:27.861 --> 57:33.322
That kid spent 10 months in traction
and another year learning to walk again.

57:33.408 --> 57:36.525
He did his fourth year from the hospital.

57:37.329 --> 57:38.489
It's up to you, Charlie,

57:38.580 --> 57:42.198
but you might consider
cutting the kid a little slack.

57:45.170 --> 57:49.254
Russians are going to find that sub
before we get near it, anyway.

58:10.570 --> 58:13.903
-Passing Thor's Twins, sir.
-Very good.

58:19.287 --> 58:20.948
Passing the Twins now, Captain.

58:21.039 --> 58:23.280
Very good.
You may commence your run.

58:23.375 --> 58:26.788
-Call me at the ﬁrst turning.
-Aye, Captain.

58:26.878 --> 58:28.914
Mr Kamarov.

58:29.423 --> 58:31.835
-You may commence your run now.
-Aye, sir.

58:31.925 --> 58:35.668
First leg on my mark, course 2-6-0.

58:35.762 --> 58:40.131
Speed, 18 knots. Depth, 270 metres.

58:40.475 --> 58:45.515
Five, four, three, two, one.

58:46.231 --> 58:48.267
Mark.

58:48.358 --> 58:50.815
Diving command, course 2-6-0.

58:50.902 --> 58:53.359
-Course 2-6-0, aye.
-Speed, 18 knots.

58:53.447 --> 58:56.780
-Speed, 18 knots, aye.
-Stop pissing, Yuri.

58:56.867 --> 58:58.482
Give me a stopwatch and a map,

58:58.577 --> 59:01.489
and I'll fly the Alps
in a plane with no windows.

59:01.580 --> 59:04.037
If the map is accurate enough.

59:25.854 --> 59:28.891
We're in the lane
and approaching first turn.

59:28.982 --> 59:32.725
Come left to course 1-9-5.

59:32.819 --> 59:36.482
In 30 seconds,
decrease depth to 200 metres.

59:36.573 --> 59:38.029
Maintain speed.

59:38.116 --> 59:40.323
Very good, Navigator.

59:41.703 --> 59:43.614
Captain, we're approaching
the first turn.

59:43.705 --> 59:45.195
Twenty-five seconds to course 1-9-5.

59:45.290 --> 59:49.124
Increase speed to 26 knots
and recompute.

59:52.547 --> 59:54.503
Aye, Captain.

59:55.884 --> 59:59.001
Navigator, recompute for 26 knots.

1:00:00.222 --> 1:00:02.383
Turn on my mark.

1:00:02.474 --> 1:00:08.219
Five, four, three, two, one. Mark.

1:00:08.313 --> 1:00:10.679
Diving control, come left to 1-9-5.

1:00:10.774 --> 1:00:13.265
-Come left to 1-9-5.
-Up on the bow planes.

1:00:21.868 --> 1:00:26.453
Course now 1-9-5
and maintaining speed 26 knots.

1:00:30.877 --> 1:00:32.708
Mr Kamarov?

1:00:33.213 --> 1:00:37.627
Next leg, Captain,
come right to course 2-4-0 now at

1:00:39.052 --> 1:00:40.792
eight minutes and 40 seconds.

1:00:40.887 --> 1:00:44.880
Very good. Maintain course and speed.

1:00:47.727 --> 1:00:50.890
Too fast, Vasily. Too fast.

1:00:51.648 --> 1:00:56.768
Those charts are laid out precisely.
So many knots for so many seconds.

1:00:56.862 --> 1:01:01.151
-And this thing handles like a pig.
-Watch your bearing, Mr Slavin.

1:01:08.248 --> 1:01:10.489
Fifteen seconds to turn, Captain.

1:01:10.584 --> 1:01:13.246
-Should we decrease speed?
-Negative.

1:01:13.336 --> 1:01:16.328
-Prepare to come right.
-Aye, sir.

1:01:16.423 --> 1:01:20.336
Eight, seven, six, five,

1:01:20.427 --> 1:01:25.137
four, three, two, one. Mark.

1:01:25.223 --> 1:01:27.509
Fifteen degrees
down angle on the bow planes.

1:01:27.601 --> 1:01:30.968
Come right 2-4-0. Move it!

1:01:50.498 --> 1:01:51.954
We're in the lane.

1:01:52.042 --> 1:01:55.500
Next leg 34 minutes
to the Neptune Massif.

1:01:55.587 --> 1:01:58.545
Course 2-4-0.

1:02:10.810 --> 1:02:12.641
What happened?

1:02:12.729 --> 1:02:15.937
The cryogenic plant!
The magnets aren't cooling.

1:02:16.024 --> 1:02:19.812
Temperature in the caterpillar
is 50 degrees above red line and rising.

1:02:19.903 --> 1:02:24.146
-It's going to melt.
-Kill it! Shut it down!

1:02:28.536 --> 1:02:30.993
-Captain?
-What happened?

1:02:31.081 --> 1:02:35.450
-The cryogenic plant failed.
-Reactor damage?

1:02:35.543 --> 1:02:38.376
There was a power spike,
but the reactor scrammed automatically.

1:02:38.463 --> 1:02:42.422
-Was there any radiation leakage?
-I don't know yet!

1:02:43.260 --> 1:02:45.922
-How long will it take to fix?
-I got to find what's wrong first.

1:02:46.012 --> 1:02:49.345
Could be the liquid helium
or the superconductors.

1:02:51.393 --> 1:02:55.261
Captain, we will have to stop
until we can repair the caterpillar unit.

1:02:55.355 --> 1:02:58.973
Negative. We'll run
on normal propulsion.

1:02:59.859 --> 1:03:02.100
Captain, we will not be silent.

1:03:02.487 --> 1:03:06.696
Make revolutions for 20 knots
and engage the propellers.

1:03:10.495 --> 1:03:12.076
Aye, Captain.

1:03:12.706 --> 1:03:16.449
-Commence engine start-up.
-He'll get us all killed.

1:03:20.964 --> 1:03:23.626
The Captain knows what he's doing.

1:03:24.592 --> 1:03:26.082
Doctor.

1:03:28.305 --> 1:03:30.011
Naval activities?

1:03:30.849 --> 1:03:34.888
I have no knowledge of this.
But then, I never was a sailor.

1:03:34.978 --> 1:03:39.062
Mr Ambassador,
you have nearly 100 vessels operating

1:03:39.149 --> 1:03:41.310
in the North Atlantic right now.

1:03:41.401 --> 1:03:43.767
Your aircraft have dropped
enough sonar buoys

1:03:43.862 --> 1:03:46.979
that a man could walk
from Greenland to Scotland

1:03:47.073 --> 1:03:50.907
without getting his feet wet.
Shall we dispense with the bull?

1:03:51.745 --> 1:03:56.489
You make your point
as delicately as ever, Mr Pelt, but...

1:03:56.583 --> 1:04:00.826
And what looks like an exercise
could be a prelude to war.

1:04:00.920 --> 1:04:02.535
How can we tell the difference?

1:04:02.630 --> 1:04:06.339
Prudence demands
that we deploy ships to observe yours.

1:04:06.426 --> 1:04:08.542
Your government should consider

1:04:08.636 --> 1:04:13.426
that having your ships and ours,
your aircraft and ours,

1:04:13.516 --> 1:04:17.805
in such proximity
is inherently dangerous.

1:04:18.396 --> 1:04:21.763
Wars have begun that way,
Mr Ambassador.

1:04:31.076 --> 1:04:34.443
-We have lost one of our submarines.
-Lost it?

1:04:34.537 --> 1:04:38.871
We fear she may be down, and...
This is most embarrassing, but...

1:04:38.958 --> 1:04:44.749
Several of the officers
are sons of high party officials.

1:04:46.549 --> 1:04:50.041
One is even the son
of a Central Committee Member.

1:04:50.136 --> 1:04:52.001
I cannot say which.

1:04:52.806 --> 1:04:55.889
You're telling me
this is a massive rescue operation?

1:04:55.975 --> 1:04:57.886
That is correct.

1:05:01.064 --> 1:05:04.477
I'm terribly sorry. How can we help?

1:05:07.195 --> 1:05:12.155
-I'm not sure that...
-Perhaps a joint rescue mission?

1:05:14.828 --> 1:05:19.322
That is very gracious of you, sir.
I'll pass your offer on.

1:05:20.917 --> 1:05:22.407
But at this time,

1:05:22.502 --> 1:05:25.460
I think we're doing everything
that can be done.

1:05:43.982 --> 1:05:45.938
Captain?

1:05:48.695 --> 1:05:54.315
Our strategy depends on your answer.
The entire fleet will know where we are.

1:05:54.409 --> 1:05:59.449
Captain, Sonar. We've been overflown
by a multi-engine turboprop.

1:05:59.539 --> 1:06:01.154
Put it on audio.

1:06:04.669 --> 1:06:07.661
Short transients, close aboard.

1:06:07.755 --> 1:06:11.543
-Water entry of small objects.
-Sonar buoys.

1:06:12.719 --> 1:06:15.426
-Battle stations.
-Battle stations!

1:06:15.513 --> 1:06:17.720
-Battle stations!
-Battle stations!

1:06:17.807 --> 1:06:20.514
How long to Neptune Massif?

1:06:21.728 --> 1:06:25.141
-How long?
-Four minutes, 10 seconds.

1:06:26.483 --> 1:06:28.314
Should we bottom the boat?

1:06:28.401 --> 1:06:31.859
No. Too late now.
We've run out of time.

1:06:32.864 --> 1:06:35.196
Countermeasures.
Prepare to launch missiles.

1:06:35.283 --> 1:06:36.739
Aye, sir.

1:06:44.959 --> 1:06:48.827
Aircraft on computer guidance.
Request permission to launch.

1:06:48.922 --> 1:06:51.664
You are authorised
to launch the weapon.

1:06:53.218 --> 1:06:55.174
Weapon is away.

1:06:59.682 --> 1:07:03.049
High speed screw!
Torpedo in the water!

1:07:03.144 --> 1:07:05.135
Stand by.

1:07:05.480 --> 1:07:07.641
Torpedo is active.

1:07:09.526 --> 1:07:11.892
Torpedo has acquired.

1:07:11.986 --> 1:07:15.945
-Launch countermeasures.
-Launch countermeasures. Aye, sir.

1:07:21.454 --> 1:07:22.944
We're in the lane.

1:07:23.039 --> 1:07:26.327
-How long till the turn at Massif?
-Two minutes, nine seconds.

1:07:26.417 --> 1:07:29.875
We have no room
to manoeuvre in these canyons.

1:07:29.963 --> 1:07:31.794
Shut up.

1:07:36.553 --> 1:07:39.260
Torpedo has reached countermeasures.

1:07:39.347 --> 1:07:42.464
-Torpedo has lost contact.
-Massif approaching.

1:07:45.478 --> 1:07:50.518
Torpedo has reacquired.
Torpedo has reacquired and is homing.

1:07:51.985 --> 1:07:53.100
Give me the count.

1:07:53.194 --> 1:07:56.903
Turn at Massif
40 degrees starboard in 30 seconds.

1:07:56.990 --> 1:08:00.608
-Time to torpedo impact?
-Torpedo impact, 35 seconds.

1:08:00.702 --> 1:08:03.193
-Increase to flank.
-Full ahead flank.

1:08:03.288 --> 1:08:05.904
-Full ahead flank.
-Full ahead flank, aye.

1:08:05.999 --> 1:08:09.116
Torpedo impact now 40 seconds.

1:08:09.877 --> 1:08:11.458
35 seconds.

1:08:18.928 --> 1:08:20.919
30 seconds.

1:08:22.098 --> 1:08:24.180
Turn at Massif in

1:08:24.267 --> 1:08:29.432
seven, six, five, four,

1:08:29.522 --> 1:08:33.640
three, two, one. Mark.

1:08:33.735 --> 1:08:35.942
Torpedo impact 25 seconds...

1:08:36.029 --> 1:08:38.315
-The turn, Captain.
-Not yet.

1:08:41.326 --> 1:08:43.282
Mark plus eight seconds.

1:08:43.369 --> 1:08:48.113
Plus nine, plus 10 seconds,
plus 11, plus 12,

1:08:48.207 --> 1:08:52.667
plus 13 seconds, plus 14,
plus 15 seconds.

1:08:52.754 --> 1:08:55.621
Captain, we're out of position
by a boat length.

1:08:55.715 --> 1:08:58.502
Torpedo impact now 15 seconds.

1:08:58.968 --> 1:09:00.629
Sound collision.

1:09:00.720 --> 1:09:03.928
-Sound collision.
-We're out of the lane!

1:09:04.015 --> 1:09:06.222
-You're relieved.
-Borodin?

1:09:12.398 --> 1:09:14.764
Right full rudder!
Reverse starboard engine!

1:09:14.859 --> 1:09:17.020
Right full rudder.
All back starboard shaft.

1:09:17.111 --> 1:09:19.693
All back starboard shaft!

1:09:21.574 --> 1:09:24.737
Torpedo impact 12 seconds,

1:09:24.827 --> 1:09:31.073
10, nine, eight, seven, six, five...

1:10:01.948 --> 1:10:05.031
-Captain, they're really shooting at us!
-Pull yourself together!

1:10:05.118 --> 1:10:06.233
VVhy?

1:10:06.703 --> 1:10:08.534
Boy! Easy, boy.

1:10:08.621 --> 1:10:13.035
If they were really shooting at us,
we'd be dead by now.

1:10:13.126 --> 1:10:15.117
Give me some line.

1:10:32.478 --> 1:10:36.221
I found out what happened
to the caterpillar.

1:10:36.315 --> 1:10:39.728
The buffer circuit has been torn out.

1:10:39.819 --> 1:10:43.903
It was only a matter of time
before an overload shut it down.

1:10:43.990 --> 1:10:46.447
-What are you saying?
-Whoever did this

1:10:46.534 --> 1:10:50.402
knew how to cripple the caterpillar
in a way not easy to find.

1:10:50.496 --> 1:10:53.533
Captain, we have a saboteur on board.

1:10:58.087 --> 1:11:00.248
It can't be any of the officers.

1:11:00.339 --> 1:11:03.001
They had plenty of time
before we embarked.

1:11:05.845 --> 1:11:07.631
Go to Putin's cabin.

1:11:07.722 --> 1:11:11.214
Check his files
for information on the crew.

1:11:11.309 --> 1:11:14.676
We may have
to put them off before we planned.

1:11:16.272 --> 1:11:20.311
The average russky, son,
don't take a dump without a plan.

1:11:22.779 --> 1:11:24.861
Wait a minute.

1:11:26.407 --> 1:11:28.648
We don't have to get
the crew off the sub.

1:11:28.743 --> 1:11:30.984
He would have had to do that.

1:11:31.078 --> 1:11:34.366
We just have to figure out
what he's going to do.

1:11:36.542 --> 1:11:38.874
How is he going to
get them off the sub?

1:11:40.087 --> 1:11:42.920
They'd have to want to get off.

1:11:44.342 --> 1:11:47.926
How do you get a crew
to want to get off a submarine?

1:11:49.347 --> 1:11:53.636
How do you get them
to want to get off a nuclear sub...

1:11:53.726 --> 1:11:55.762
I know how he's going
to evacuate the sub.

1:11:55.853 --> 1:11:56.842
Not now, Jack.

1:11:56.938 --> 1:12:00.476
Yankee One star base,
say again status.

1:12:00.566 --> 1:12:03.979
-Declare an emergency.
-Declare an emergency.

1:12:04.070 --> 1:12:05.856
Yankee One, requesting vectors.

1:12:05.947 --> 1:12:09.189
Vector 2-7-0 speed is buster.

1:12:09.283 --> 1:12:10.989
Yankee One's losing
hydraulic pressure.

1:12:11.077 --> 1:12:12.908
Say again, Yankee One.

1:12:12.995 --> 1:12:15.486
Bear Foxtrot got too close to the group.

1:12:15.581 --> 1:12:18.994
One of the F-14s crowded him,
and they bumped.

1:12:19.085 --> 1:12:21.667
He's losing hydraulic fluid.

1:12:21.754 --> 1:12:24.666
They're trying to get him
back aboard now.

1:12:24.757 --> 1:12:26.372
Busy morning.

1:12:27.927 --> 1:12:32.796
Russian attack subs are now stationed
off every east coast port.

1:12:32.890 --> 1:12:34.755
We're up here.

1:12:35.685 --> 1:12:38.017
The New Jersey is moving up the coast

1:12:38.104 --> 1:12:41.141
while the Russians,
aside from over 100 Bear Foxtrots,

1:12:41.232 --> 1:12:44.850
have a row of subs
and several surface groups.

1:12:44.944 --> 1:12:48.152
-That's a lot of firepower.
-For a rescue team, yes.

1:12:48.698 --> 1:12:50.359
There's something else strange.

1:12:50.449 --> 1:12:53.156
They're using sonar
as if they're looking for something,

1:12:53.244 --> 1:12:55.735
-but nobody's listening.
-What do you mean?

1:12:55.830 --> 1:13:01.075
At their speed they could run over
my daughter's stereo and not hear it.

1:13:02.461 --> 1:13:05.328
They're not searching for Ramius.
They're driving him.

1:13:05.423 --> 1:13:07.539
Driving him where?

1:13:11.095 --> 1:13:13.507
The hounds to the hunters.

1:13:13.598 --> 1:13:16.761
Your sub captain's
going to make it to America.

1:13:17.810 --> 1:13:20.643
He's going to die within sight of it.

1:13:20.730 --> 1:13:24.097
His wing man
kept requesting permission to fire.

1:13:24.191 --> 1:13:25.897
Somebody messes up,

1:13:25.985 --> 1:13:28.772
we'll be in the biggest naval battle
since the Jutland.

1:13:28.863 --> 1:13:30.854
Jesus!

1:13:31.365 --> 1:13:33.947
Water's too cold to eject him.

1:13:34.035 --> 1:13:38.620
-Air boss will try to bring him aboard.
-Sir, what's this sub off by herself?

1:13:38.706 --> 1:13:40.492
Bart Mancuso's boat.

1:13:40.583 --> 1:13:43.916
He's going to the bottom
of Red Route One.

1:13:44.003 --> 1:13:47.996
He's had intermittent contact
with a magma displacement.

1:13:48.090 --> 1:13:50.251
-He's got this...
-Magma displacement?

1:13:50.343 --> 1:13:54.382
-Is that like a seismic anomaly?
-I suppose so. Why?

1:13:55.014 --> 1:13:57.551
Is there a way you could get me
onboard the Dallas?

1:13:57.642 --> 1:13:58.757
What for?

1:13:58.851 --> 1:14:01.968
I think Mancuso's
found the Red October.

1:14:02.063 --> 1:14:05.396
He hasn't found anything, Jack.
He's just waiting.

1:14:05.483 --> 1:14:07.519
Sir, this silent propulsion system

1:14:07.610 --> 1:14:09.566
could easily be mistaken
for something...

1:14:09.654 --> 1:14:13.772
The only way to get you onto Dallas
is to fly you out to a chopper.

1:14:13.866 --> 1:14:15.402
The only way to get you that far north

1:14:15.493 --> 1:14:18.200
is to use a chopper turned
into a flying gas can.

1:14:18.287 --> 1:14:22.530
Admiral, Yankee One is on final.
Rescue personnel are in place.

1:14:23.334 --> 1:14:27.202
Pick up your left wing.
You’re drifting left. Power, power!

1:14:27.296 --> 1:14:29.503
Wave off, wave off!

1:14:29.590 --> 1:14:31.797
Eject, eject, eject!

1:14:41.560 --> 1:14:45.348
Fire, ﬁre! Fire on the flight deck!

1:14:45.439 --> 1:14:50.684
This business will get out of control,
and we'll be lucky to live through it.

1:14:53.030 --> 1:14:56.864
Fire on the ﬂight deck.
All hands lend assistance.

1:15:03.582 --> 1:15:06.244
The bird's loaded down
with enough fuel to get you there,

1:15:06.335 --> 1:15:08.041
but Dallas may not be there.

1:15:08.129 --> 1:15:11.872
We're trying to reach her.
If she's gone deep, it's dodgy.

1:15:11.966 --> 1:15:14.252
If you have to ditch...

1:15:21.726 --> 1:15:23.216
If you have to ditch,

1:15:23.310 --> 1:15:25.767
don't think about anything
but the survival gear.

1:15:25.855 --> 1:15:29.439
At this water's temperature,
you'll have about four minutes.

1:15:29.525 --> 1:15:31.607
I'll try to remember that.

1:15:34.280 --> 1:15:37.693
Next time, Jack,
write a goddamn memo.

1:16:03.142 --> 1:16:05.133
Diving officer,
make your depth 6-5-0 feet.

1:16:05.227 --> 1:16:06.888
Make my depth 6-5-0 feet.

1:16:06.979 --> 1:16:10.062
Sonar, Conn preceding
below the thermal layer.

1:16:10.983 --> 1:16:13.224
-The captain's sacked out?
-Yeah.

1:16:13.319 --> 1:16:17.232
-Auxiliaries proceed 5,000 pounds.
-What about him?

1:16:17.656 --> 1:16:19.271
He won't leave.

1:16:19.366 --> 1:16:24.110
Conn. Sonar, hold.
No contacts on bearing 2-9-5.

1:16:29.001 --> 1:16:32.994
You know, I seen me a mermaid once.

1:16:33.631 --> 1:16:37.419
I've even seen me
a shark eat a octopus,

1:16:37.510 --> 1:16:41.549
but I ain't never seen
no phantom Russian submarine.

1:17:20.386 --> 1:17:22.126
We're emerging
from the route, Captain.

1:17:22.221 --> 1:17:24.462
I've ordered
a routine clearing of the baffles.

1:17:24.557 --> 1:17:28.266
We'll be making
the first turn in a few minutes.

1:17:28.352 --> 1:17:32.516
The caterpillar is operational
and appears to be running normally.

1:17:34.567 --> 1:17:39.231
The crew know about the saboteur.
They are afraid.

1:17:41.532 --> 1:17:44.524
That could
be useful when the time comes.

1:17:47.830 --> 1:17:52.324
You know, we could make
the Labrador Coast in 16 hours.

1:17:53.210 --> 1:17:56.498
Half of them
would freeze before they were rescued.

1:17:56.589 --> 1:18:00.923
No, it's Massachusetts or Maine...
In 48 hours.

1:18:01.886 --> 1:18:04.343
Two days.

1:18:10.895 --> 1:18:14.228
Do you think
they will let me live in Montana?

1:18:23.115 --> 1:18:27.028
I would think
they'll let you live wherever you want.

1:18:27.828 --> 1:18:32.697
Good. Then lwill live in Montana,

1:18:32.791 --> 1:18:37.376
and I will marry a round
American woman and raise rabbits,

1:18:37.463 --> 1:18:43.254
and she will cook them for me,
and I will have a pickup truck.

1:18:44.845 --> 1:18:46.506
Ora...

1:18:47.431 --> 1:18:52.300
Possibly even a recreational vehicle

1:18:52.394 --> 1:18:54.726
and drive from state to state.

1:18:56.815 --> 1:18:59.727
-Do they let you do that?
-Yes.

1:18:59.818 --> 1:19:04.562
-No papers?
-No papers. State to state.

1:19:04.657 --> 1:19:07.023
All right. Commence your turn.

1:19:10.913 --> 1:19:16.453
Then in winter I will live in Arizona.

1:19:18.170 --> 1:19:21.913
-Actually, I think I will need two wives.
-At least.

1:19:32.643 --> 1:19:36.602
-Possible aspect change on target.
-Sonar, Conn. Aye.

1:19:36.689 --> 1:19:39.852
Concur possible
target zig based on bearing rate.

1:19:43.112 --> 1:19:45.603
-Conn! Sonar! Crazy Ivan!
-All stop! Quick quiet!

1:19:45.698 --> 1:19:48.405
-AII stop, aye.
-Engine's all stopped.

1:19:54.581 --> 1:19:56.947
What's going on, Jonesy?

1:19:57.042 --> 1:19:59.158
Russian captains
sometimes turn suddenly

1:19:59.253 --> 1:20:03.838
to see if anyone's behind them.
We call it Crazy Ivan.

1:20:04.883 --> 1:20:06.419
The only thing you can do is go dead,

1:20:06.510 --> 1:20:10.469
shut everything down,
and make like a hole in the water.

1:20:10.556 --> 1:20:12.467
So what's the catch?

1:20:12.558 --> 1:20:16.722
Catch is a boat this big
doesn't exactly stop on a dime.

1:20:17.604 --> 1:20:21.517
If we're too close,
we'll drift right into the back of him.

1:20:24.820 --> 1:20:28.358
What about you?
What do you look forward to?

1:20:40.002 --> 1:20:43.210
I have no such appetites.

1:20:44.048 --> 1:20:46.881
Now, let's see if he can hear us.

1:20:51.597 --> 1:20:54.509
There must be something.

1:21:02.274 --> 1:21:04.356
What is it?

1:21:07.613 --> 1:21:11.652
I miss the peace of fishing

1:21:12.451 --> 1:21:15.443
like when I was a boy.

1:21:17.623 --> 1:21:20.911
Forty years I have been at sea.

1:21:21.960 --> 1:21:24.952
A war at sea.

1:21:26.173 --> 1:21:28.915
A war with no battles.

1:21:30.636 --> 1:21:32.752
No monuments.

1:21:34.098 --> 1:21:36.339
Only casualties.

1:21:40.062 --> 1:21:44.101
lwidowed her the day I married her.

1:21:47.444 --> 1:21:50.811
My wife died
while I was at sea, you know.

1:22:09.466 --> 1:22:12.128
Post guards in the engineering spaces.

1:22:12.219 --> 1:22:16.883
If he can get to the caterpillar,
he can get to somewhere more vital.

1:22:20.394 --> 1:22:23.056
-Where is he, Jonesy?
-Conn, Sonar.

1:22:23.147 --> 1:22:26.059
Target is now coming out
of our starboard baffles.

1:22:26.150 --> 1:22:29.642
My read is that
he is returning to base course.

1:22:30.529 --> 1:22:33.271
Concur. He's returning to course 2-1-0.

1:22:33.365 --> 1:22:35.777
He went right around us.

1:22:36.660 --> 1:22:41.495
We'll give him another 30 seconds,
then secure from silent running.

1:22:42.166 --> 1:22:43.622
Captain?

1:22:44.376 --> 1:22:46.662
Here's what we got on the ELF.

1:22:48.422 --> 1:22:50.287
-Thanks.
-Aye, sir.

1:22:58.182 --> 1:23:00.218
What is it?

1:23:02.060 --> 1:23:04.802
You're not going to believe this.

1:23:17.493 --> 1:23:19.484
Commander, we are
approaching no return.

1:23:19.578 --> 1:23:21.443
Dallas apparently
hasn't gotten the message.

1:23:21.538 --> 1:23:24.780
-We have to turn back for the carrier.
-Give it a couple more minutes.

1:23:24.875 --> 1:23:27.161
Negative. Fuel status
says we turn around now.

1:23:27.252 --> 1:23:30.335
Fuel status?
You got a reserve, don't you?

1:23:30.422 --> 1:23:32.583
I've got a 10—minute reserve,

1:23:32.674 --> 1:23:35.165
but I'm not allowed
to invade that except during war.

1:23:35.260 --> 1:23:38.844
If you don't get me on that submarine,
you might have it.

1:23:38.931 --> 1:23:43.174
You got 10 minutes worth of fuel.
We stay here 10 more minutes.

1:23:49.066 --> 1:23:53.901
Mount up! I got a submarine
at around 3:00. About 2 miles.

1:23:55.614 --> 1:23:56.945
Okay, Tony, hook him up.

1:23:57.032 --> 1:24:00.524
I'll be lowering you down
to the submarine now.

1:24:00.619 --> 1:24:05.363
Give me eight minutes.
Let's hope this thing runs on fumes.

1:24:05.457 --> 1:24:08.494
-Very well. Surface the ship.
-Surface the ship. Aye, sir.

1:24:08.585 --> 1:24:11.247
Whoever this guy is,
he's in for one hell of a ride.

1:24:11.338 --> 1:24:14.080
Okay, Commander,
go ahead and sit down.

1:24:15.634 --> 1:24:19.923
-You ever do this before?
-Once. On a calm day off Hawaii.

1:24:20.013 --> 1:24:23.756
The pilot will have
a difficult time keeping steady.

1:24:23.850 --> 1:24:27.058
Don't take chances getting grounded.
Keep that rod in front of you.

1:24:27.145 --> 1:24:28.225
In air like this,

1:24:28.313 --> 1:24:29.894
the rotors will
put out enough static electricity

1:24:29.982 --> 1:24:31.188
to light up Chicago.

1:24:31.275 --> 1:24:32.515
That's why Ijoined the Navy.

1:24:32.609 --> 1:24:36.397
A diver's in the escape trunk
in case this guy goes in the drink.

1:24:36.488 --> 1:24:40.822
Someone must have a burr up his ass
to go for a stunt like this.

1:24:59.386 --> 1:25:02.469
All right. Ready! Ready!
Get your hook up!

1:25:04.933 --> 1:25:07.766
Commander,
if I got to bring you back up,

1:25:07.853 --> 1:25:10.686
I 'm going to shake the wire.
I’ll give you a thumbs up, like this.

1:25:12.024 --> 1:25:15.437
Remember to cross your arms.
Got it? Okay. Out you go.

1:25:15.527 --> 1:25:17.893
Passenger's out the door.

1:25:24.411 --> 1:25:28.199
Passenger's halfway down,
drifting fon/vard. Start fon/vard.

1:25:32.502 --> 1:25:35.539
All right, Tommy.
Get the hook on his cable.

1:25:36.131 --> 1:25:40.795
On his cable. Now, watch it.
Don't touch him. Okay, here he comes.

1:25:45.974 --> 1:25:46.963
No!

1:25:47.059 --> 1:25:49.971
It would be easier
without that bloody crosswind.

1:25:50.062 --> 1:25:52.303
Where is he? I can 't see him.

1:25:53.565 --> 1:25:55.396
Don't touch him!

1:25:56.401 --> 1:25:59.063
Jacliacliack!

1:26:01.114 --> 1:26:05.073
-This is never going to work.
-Okay, reel him back in.

1:26:12.584 --> 1:26:15.496
Tony, what's going on back...

1:26:19.675 --> 1:26:21.666
What happened? Dallas,
have you got a swimmer standing?

1:26:21.760 --> 1:26:26.470
Emergency stop! Man overboard!
Port side! Send out the diver!

1:26:26.556 --> 1:26:29.172
Very well, Dallas. We are history.

1:26:38.068 --> 1:26:41.652
Get the doc down here!
I'll be in the escape trunk.

1:26:45.283 --> 1:26:48.616
Down ladder!
Down ladder! Make a hole!

1:26:51.957 --> 1:26:54.824
Watch his head. Watch his head.

1:27:05.137 --> 1:27:10.348
How do you do, Captain?
It's a pleasure to be aboard.

1:27:11.810 --> 1:27:14.301
I have to talk to the President.

1:27:15.772 --> 1:27:19.435
Of course.
May I inquire as to the subject?

1:27:21.194 --> 1:27:25.062
It seems that the initial reports
that one of our submarines was missing

1:27:25.157 --> 1:27:27.864
were not completely accurate.

1:27:29.828 --> 1:27:32.069
The submarine in question

1:27:32.164 --> 1:27:36.077
is commanded
by Captain Marko Ramius.

1:27:36.168 --> 1:27:40.582
Apparently, he has suffered
a kind of mental or nervous breakdown.

1:27:42.257 --> 1:27:44.669
Just before he sailed,

1:27:44.760 --> 1:27:48.469
he posted a letter
to Admiral Yuri Padorin

1:27:48.555 --> 1:27:52.013
in which he announced his intention to...

1:27:53.852 --> 1:27:57.094
To fire his missiles
on the United States.

1:27:58.398 --> 1:28:00.354
Why didn't you tell me this
the last time we met?

1:28:00.442 --> 1:28:02.558
In my position
I'm sometimes compromised

1:28:02.652 --> 1:28:06.236
by the fact Moscow
doesn't always tell me everything.

1:28:06.323 --> 1:28:09.611
So one of your
submarine captains has gone insane?

1:28:09.701 --> 1:28:13.285
-What do you want from us?
-You offered your assistance.

1:28:13.371 --> 1:28:14.952
That was a rescue mission.

1:28:15.040 --> 1:28:19.158
Now you want us to help you
hunt him down and kill him.

1:28:19.252 --> 1:28:24.588
I have been instructed
to ask your president for precisely that.

1:28:24.674 --> 1:28:28.542
Find him? We already found him.
We had to break off to pick you up.

1:28:28.637 --> 1:28:31.424
-Captain, excuse me. Coffee?
-Thank you.

1:28:31.515 --> 1:28:33.676
-Cigarette?
-Don't smoke.

1:28:34.267 --> 1:28:36.974
Assuming we can find him,

1:28:37.062 --> 1:28:39.053
just what exactly
am I supposed to do about it?

1:28:39.147 --> 1:28:40.478
Captain, radio.

1:28:40.565 --> 1:28:43.477
We 're receiving ﬂash trafﬁc
on the VLF emergency circuit.

1:28:43.568 --> 1:28:46.401
Very well. Bring it down.

1:28:47.572 --> 1:28:49.858
Mr Ryan?

1:28:52.369 --> 1:28:56.487
-Chief, excuse us for a second.
-Leonard, come on out of there.

1:29:02.921 --> 1:29:06.163
The sub we're after
is called the Red October.

1:29:06.258 --> 1:29:08.544
She's under the command
of a man named Ramius.

1:29:08.635 --> 1:29:09.920
Now, there's the possibility

1:29:10.011 --> 1:29:14.254
that he and a good portion of his crew
are attempting to defect.

1:29:16.935 --> 1:29:18.596
Defect?

1:29:19.896 --> 1:29:21.557
Excuse me.

1:29:38.748 --> 1:29:40.830
You say the boat's called
the Red October?

1:29:40.917 --> 1:29:42.999
-That's right.
-Skipper's Ramius?

1:29:43.086 --> 1:29:44.826
Right.

1:29:44.921 --> 1:29:49.005
It seems the circumstances
have changed somewhat, Mr Ryan.

1:29:56.266 --> 1:29:57.506
Get this man some dry clothes.

1:29:57.601 --> 1:30:00.513
-I'Il be in the conn.
-Aye, aye, sir.

1:30:01.354 --> 1:30:02.434
"National Command Authority

1:30:02.522 --> 1:30:05.104
"informed Soviet
Typhoon-class submarine Red October

1:30:05.191 --> 1:30:06.681
"is potential renegade

1:30:06.776 --> 1:30:09.859
"and threatens
independent missile launch.

1:30:09.946 --> 1:30:12.358
"You are authorised to
use any necessary force

1:30:12.449 --> 1:30:13.529
"to prevent said submarine

1:30:13.617 --> 1:30:16.905
"from approaching the coast
of the United States."

1:30:31.134 --> 1:30:33.625
Left 10 degrees rudder
steady on course 265.

1:30:33.720 --> 1:30:36.427
Left 10 degrees rudder
secure course of 2-6-5.

1:30:36.514 --> 1:30:38.470
Make turns for 14 knots.

1:30:39.684 --> 1:30:42.721
Chief of the watch, rig for red.

1:30:46.024 --> 1:30:49.733
Time Quartermasters and Navigator
on the deck in the conn.

1:30:52.989 --> 1:30:54.104
What's going on?

1:30:54.199 --> 1:30:57.908
-Battle stations are manned and ready.
-Very well.

1:30:57.994 --> 1:31:00.701
-Captain, I have to talk to you.
-Not now.

1:31:00.789 --> 1:31:04.498
Make your depth 1,200 feet,
20 degrees down angle.

1:31:04.584 --> 1:31:08.827
Diving Officer, make your depth
1,200 feet, 20 degree down.

1:31:10.507 --> 1:31:13.795
Full dive on fair water planes.
Full dive on stem planes.

1:31:13.885 --> 1:31:16.547
Twenty degree down.

1:31:18.598 --> 1:31:21.886
Passing 450 feet, going to 1,200.

1:31:23.395 --> 1:31:24.885
Five hundred.

1:31:27.065 --> 1:31:28.555
Six hundred.

1:31:30.568 --> 1:31:32.308
Seven hundred.

1:31:36.741 --> 1:31:38.402
Did you get a good fix?

1:31:38.493 --> 1:31:39.858
-Yes, Captain.
-Very well.

1:31:39.953 --> 1:31:42.239
At ordered depth, 1,200 feet.

1:31:47.460 --> 1:31:52.170
-Sonar, Conn. You got him, yet, Jonesy?
-Veiy faint, sir. Hold on.

1:31:53.800 --> 1:31:57.042
Yes, sir. Contact Typhoon 7
on bearing 2-5-0.

1:31:57.137 --> 1:31:58.502
Right where he's supposed to be.

1:31:58.596 --> 1:32:02.714
-Any sign he's alerted to our presence?
-No. Operating as before.

1:32:03.643 --> 1:32:07.227
Come left 2-6-5.
Bring us up behind him quietly, Tommy.

1:32:07.313 --> 1:32:08.393
Aye, aye, Captain.

1:32:08.481 --> 1:32:11.518
Diving Officer,
make your depth 500 feet.

1:32:20.535 --> 1:32:24.073
Captain, please listen to me.
Two minutes, that's all.

1:32:25.707 --> 1:32:29.620
-Plot, time to intercept his track.
-Four minutes, Captain.

1:32:30.462 --> 1:32:33.295
Very well, Mr Ryan. Two minutes.

1:32:39.971 --> 1:32:42.383
It makes perfect sense.

1:32:42.474 --> 1:32:45.637
Look at the situation,
Ramius intends to defect.

1:32:45.727 --> 1:32:48.719
The Russians know this,
which is why they've tried to sink him,

1:32:48.813 --> 1:32:50.929
but they haven't been able to...

1:32:51.024 --> 1:32:52.730
-I have a firing solution.
-Very well.

1:32:52.817 --> 1:32:54.899
Captain, you have to listen to me.

1:32:54.986 --> 1:32:57.898
The Russians will stop at nothing
to prevent Ramius from detecting.

1:32:57.989 --> 1:33:00.105
They've invented
this story that he's crazy

1:33:00.200 --> 1:33:04.034
because they need us to sink him
before he can contact us.

1:33:06.039 --> 1:33:10.453
Weapons Control, I want full safeties.
I don't want this fish coming back.

1:33:10.543 --> 1:33:13.831
-Full safety.
-Captain, I know this man.

1:33:15.965 --> 1:33:19.378
-Has he made any Crazy Ivans?
-What difference does that make?

1:33:19.469 --> 1:33:21.881
-The next one will be to starboard.
-Why? Because his last was to port?

1:33:21.971 --> 1:33:25.884
Because he goes to starboard
in the bottom half of the hour.

1:33:30.021 --> 1:33:32.683
Flood tubes one and two.
Warm up the weapons.

1:33:32.774 --> 1:33:35.982
Find a way to establish contact
without violating orders.

1:33:36.069 --> 1:33:37.809
He wants to defect!

1:33:37.904 --> 1:33:42.113
Mr Thompson, call Chief Watson
to the conn with his sidearm.

1:33:46.496 --> 1:33:49.408
Conn, Sonar.
Signal to noise ratio ’3 dropping.

1:33:49.499 --> 1:33:51.114
Possible aspect change in target.

1:33:51.209 --> 1:33:54.292
Possible target zig
based on bearing rate.

1:33:55.713 --> 1:33:58.045
Conn, Sonar. Crazy Ivan!

1:34:00.885 --> 1:34:02.375
Captain.

1:34:03.680 --> 1:34:06.217
Captain, he's turning.

1:34:08.977 --> 1:34:12.390
-Which way is he turning?
-To the starboard, sir.

1:34:13.815 --> 1:34:16.852
Give the man a chance.

1:34:18.444 --> 1:34:20.230
All back full.

1:34:20.738 --> 1:34:22.774
-Captain, say again.
-I said all back full!

1:34:22.866 --> 1:34:25.699
Back full. Aye, sir. Engines back full.

1:34:29.873 --> 1:34:31.989
We're cavitating. He can hear us!

1:34:32.083 --> 1:34:36.452
-Conn, aye. All stop.
-AII stop, aye.

1:34:36.546 --> 1:34:41.961
All right. We just unzipped our fly.
Mr Thompson, open the outer doors.

1:34:42.051 --> 1:34:44.167
Firing point procedures.

1:34:44.262 --> 1:34:46.218
Now, if that bastard
so much as twitches,

1:34:46.306 --> 1:34:48.513
I'm going to blow him right to Mars.

1:34:48.600 --> 1:34:50.886
All stop rudder amidships.

1:34:51.561 --> 1:34:55.270
What's going on?
Can you identify the contact?

1:34:55.356 --> 1:34:58.769
American Los Angeles
class attack submarine bearing 0-1-5...

1:34:58.860 --> 1:35:00.976
Captain, sharp metallic transients.

1:35:01.070 --> 1:35:03.982
He may be trying to open
his torpedo tube doors.

1:35:04.073 --> 1:35:05.734
Outer doors are open
on tubes one and two.

1:35:05.825 --> 1:35:08.282
-We're ready to shoot.
-Very well.

1:35:09.120 --> 1:35:11.736
My orders are specific, Mr Ryan.

1:35:11.831 --> 1:35:15.198
He's opened his outer doors.
He's preparing to fire.

1:35:15.293 --> 1:35:17.375
Flood tubes three and four
and plot a solution.

1:35:17.462 --> 1:35:21.250
Captain, flood tubes three and four.
Plot solution.

1:35:22.383 --> 1:35:26.046
Shall I open the torpedo tube door, sir?

1:35:27.513 --> 1:35:31.131
-Captain, shall I open outer doors?
-No.

1:35:32.894 --> 1:35:36.182
Lock the firing solution
into the computer.

1:35:36.940 --> 1:35:39.226
Do not open the doors.

1:35:46.824 --> 1:35:49.156
Aye, Captain.

1:35:49.827 --> 1:35:52.068
Lock solution into computer.

1:35:53.122 --> 1:35:55.238
Conn, Sonar.
Target’s flooded his tubes.

1:35:55.333 --> 1:35:57.540
Has he opened his outer doors?

1:35:57.627 --> 1:36:01.586
Negative, Captain.
He '3 just sitting there. Hold on.

1:36:02.715 --> 1:36:07.004
-HuIl popping. Target's coming shallow.
-What's that mean?

1:36:09.472 --> 1:36:12.760
That means he's a very cool customer,
your Russian.

1:36:12.850 --> 1:36:14.260
He knows we're here
and ready to shoot.

1:36:14.352 --> 1:36:16.183
He's not provoking us.

1:36:16.271 --> 1:36:18.603
He's heading to periscope depth
to see what's on the surface.

1:36:18.690 --> 1:36:22.057
-What's his course?
-His course is 2-7-0, due west.

1:36:23.194 --> 1:36:26.311
-Bring us alongside him.
-Aye, aye, Captain.

1:36:26.406 --> 1:36:29.022
Sonar, Conn. Report all contacts.

1:36:29.575 --> 1:36:34.114
Conn, Sonar. My only contact
is Typhoon 7, bearing 1-9-5.

1:36:34.205 --> 1:36:39.165
-Very well. Fire control, range to target?
-Range is 300 yards.

1:36:40.837 --> 1:36:43.123
Make your depth 65 feet.

1:36:43.214 --> 1:36:46.297
Diving Officer, make your depth 65 feet.

1:36:46.384 --> 1:36:51.253
He wants to go up and take a peek.
We'll play along.

1:37:06.112 --> 1:37:10.071
-Going to 45.
-Going to 45.

1:37:10.742 --> 1:37:12.824
-Weapons status?
-Weapons are on.

1:37:12.910 --> 1:37:16.869
Tubes three and four are flooded.
Outer doors are closed.

1:37:16.956 --> 1:37:20.369
-Twenty-five metres.
-Depth 25 metres.

1:37:20.460 --> 1:37:23.418
Mark this bearing.

1:37:29.927 --> 1:37:34.387
You wanted to talk to him, Mr Ryan.
There he is.

1:37:34.474 --> 1:37:36.465
What do you want to say?

1:37:36.559 --> 1:37:39.767
-ls he the only one looking?
-Probably.

1:37:40.688 --> 1:37:42.974
We'll have to chance that.

1:37:44.275 --> 1:37:47.984
"U.S. told
you intend missile launch." Break.

1:37:48.988 --> 1:37:53.448
"Do not approach U.S. coast
or you will be attacked." Break.

1:37:54.202 --> 1:37:58.866
"If intention is other
will you discuss option?" Break.

1:38:00.291 --> 1:38:03.033
Can he acknowledge with a single ping?

1:38:03.127 --> 1:38:06.585
Yeah, he can. The question is, will he?

1:38:14.347 --> 1:38:19.307
Verify our range to target.
One ping only.

1:38:21.270 --> 1:38:23.511
Aye, Captain.

1:38:29.570 --> 1:38:33.358
I'll be damned. Now what?

1:38:35.284 --> 1:38:36.899
All right.

1:38:36.994 --> 1:38:39.656
"If defection

1:38:42.750 --> 1:38:47.335
"you plot course toward..." The chart.

1:38:48.506 --> 1:38:52.795
I need a chart. No. No.

1:38:52.885 --> 1:38:57.754
Okay. Where the hell are we?
Someplace deep. Someplace deep.

1:38:57.849 --> 1:39:00.761
Okay. Okay!

1:39:01.727 --> 1:39:04.184
Send them this!

1:39:06.941 --> 1:39:10.183
-You out of your mind?
-Just send it.

1:39:14.532 --> 1:39:16.363
Tell me one thing.

1:39:16.451 --> 1:39:19.614
How did you know
he was going to go to starboard?

1:39:19.704 --> 1:39:21.194
I didn't.

1:39:22.206 --> 1:39:26.199
I had a 50/50 chance.
I needed a break. Sorry.

1:39:27.170 --> 1:39:30.754
That's all right, Mr Ryan.
My Morse is so rusty

1:39:30.840 --> 1:39:34.378
I may be sending dimensions
on playmate of the month.

1:39:53.905 --> 1:39:56.567
Reverify our range to target.

1:39:57.909 --> 1:40:01.777
-One ping only.
-Captain, Ijust...

1:40:01.871 --> 1:40:05.955
Give me a ping, Vasily.
One ping only, please.

1:40:09.462 --> 1:40:11.202
Aye, Captain.

1:40:15.551 --> 1:40:17.883
What the hell is this about?

1:40:18.846 --> 1:40:24.466
The Russians want us to sink her.
We might have to do that.

1:40:32.401 --> 1:40:36.485
We must give
this American a wide berth.

1:40:37.573 --> 1:40:40.030
Let us turn south.

1:40:49.794 --> 1:40:51.625
Mr Kamarov.

1:40:53.714 --> 1:40:57.377
-Plot a new course due south.
-Yes, sir.

1:40:58.135 --> 1:41:00.751
New course 1-8-0.

1:41:33.296 --> 1:41:36.333
It's the reactor! Shut down the reactor!

1:41:38.843 --> 1:41:43.132
-Seal the ventilation system!
-The ventilation controls have failed!

1:41:43.222 --> 1:41:46.510
Everybody out. Clear the compartment!

1:41:47.351 --> 1:41:49.091
Out!

1:41:58.154 --> 1:42:00.110
Ventilation system, shut it down now.

1:42:00.197 --> 1:42:03.064
They don't respond.
The controls don't respond!

1:42:03.159 --> 1:42:06.572
Bypass it. Seal it manually!
Move! Shut it off.

1:42:07.788 --> 1:42:09.904
Melekhin, say again.

1:42:17.715 --> 1:42:19.876
Suffered a leak in
the primary coolant tube,

1:42:19.967 --> 1:42:21.423
so shut down the reactor,

1:42:21.510 --> 1:42:24.502
but the ventilation
circuits have been disabled.

1:42:24.597 --> 1:42:26.508
The coolant appears
highly contaminated.

1:42:26.599 --> 1:42:28.965
I knew there was damage
when the caterpillar went down.

1:42:29.060 --> 1:42:31.802
Radiation alarms activating
in all compartments.

1:42:31.896 --> 1:42:35.480
Engineering is heavily contaminated,
and radiation's moving fonrvard.

1:42:35.566 --> 1:42:38.148
Get to periscope depth.
Ventilate with outside air.

1:42:38.235 --> 1:42:39.975
Aye, Captain. Periscope depth!

1:42:40.071 --> 1:42:42.528
-Prepare to ventilate!
-Ventilating won't do anything.

1:42:42.615 --> 1:42:45.652
-We've got to get them off.
-What's the battery condition?

1:42:45.743 --> 1:42:49.827
-Four hours. Six, if we 're cautious.
-Engage battery system.

1:42:49.914 --> 1:42:52.155
We've got a level one radiation leak.

1:42:52.249 --> 1:42:54.035
Every surface
of this ship's contaminated.

1:42:54.126 --> 1:42:57.038
We've got to get the men off.

1:42:57.713 --> 1:43:00.830
Sir, we have been sabotaged!

1:43:00.925 --> 1:43:04.417
-Who said anything about sabotage?
-Captain!

1:43:04.512 --> 1:43:07.845
Sir, I'm afraid the doctor is right.

1:43:12.978 --> 1:43:14.388
Very well.

1:43:14.480 --> 1:43:17.938
Surface. We'll evacuate
the men to the deck.

1:43:18.025 --> 1:43:20.687
Aye, Captain. Surface the ship!

1:43:20.778 --> 1:43:23.190
Prepare to muster
all personnel to escape hatches.

1:43:23.280 --> 1:43:26.488
Break out the rafts.
Lash them to the deck.

1:43:26.575 --> 1:43:30.238
We'll use them as shelters
until the fleet arrives.

1:44:12.663 --> 1:44:14.949
Make sure the count
is accurate, Doctor.

1:44:15.040 --> 1:44:18.453
-We must get the entire crew out.
-Yes, sir.

1:44:18.544 --> 1:44:22.787
Master-at-arms reports rafts secure
and evacuation proceeding.

1:44:22.882 --> 1:44:24.372
Very good.

1:44:33.184 --> 1:44:36.847
No officer will spend
more than 20 minutes below deck.

1:44:36.937 --> 1:44:38.848
-Will that be satisfactory?
-Completely, Captain.

1:44:38.939 --> 1:44:44.730
Surface contact, 2-7-0,
six miles and closing fast.

1:44:45.237 --> 1:44:48.946
-It's a warship.
-What? Here? Can you identify it?

1:44:49.033 --> 1:44:53.948
It's a frigate, U.S., probably,
Perry class. He's signalling.

1:44:55.164 --> 1:45:00.659
"Red October. Red October.
Halt and stay where you are.

1:45:00.753 --> 1:45:05.042
"Do not attempt to submerge,
or you will be fired upon."

1:45:07.259 --> 1:45:11.343
Captain, I think he means to board us.

1:45:16.227 --> 1:45:18.343
You will go with the crew.

1:45:18.437 --> 1:45:21.804
The officers and I
will submerge beneath you

1:45:21.899 --> 1:45:24.390
and scuttle the ship.

1:45:24.485 --> 1:45:28.273
You'll receive
the Order of Lenin for this, Captain.

1:45:37.289 --> 1:45:41.999
We're going to cast off.
The captain's going to scuttle the ship.

1:45:47.758 --> 1:45:49.089
He's going down, sir.

1:45:49.176 --> 1:45:52.464
Put a shot across his bow.
Come right at 1-8-0.

1:46:23.836 --> 1:46:27.294
Seahawk One, this is bravo command.

1:46:44.315 --> 1:46:45.976
She's ready.

1:46:47.610 --> 1:46:49.851
Seahawk One,
release on my command.

1:46:49.945 --> 1:46:53.278
Drop now, now, now.

1:47:01.332 --> 1:47:04.369
Range to target, 900 yards.

1:47:05.169 --> 1:47:07.034
Eight hundred yards.

1:47:09.006 --> 1:47:10.746
Seven hundred yards.

1:47:12.051 --> 1:47:14.417
Six hundred yards.

1:47:18.849 --> 1:47:20.635
Five hundred yards.

1:47:22.853 --> 1:47:24.935
Four hundred yards.

1:47:26.690 --> 1:47:28.851
Three hundred yards.

1:47:31.278 --> 1:47:33.690
The torpedo is detonated.

1:47:34.365 --> 1:47:39.234
Now, understand, Commander,
that torpedo did not self-destruct.

1:47:39.328 --> 1:47:43.617
You heard it hit the hull.
And I was never here.

1:47:45.209 --> 1:47:47.621
Contact Dallas. Give them the go.

1:47:47.711 --> 1:47:50.202
Advise Dallas. Get the DSRV moving.

1:47:50.297 --> 1:47:51.753
Dallas, this is Rueben James.

1:47:58.639 --> 1:48:00.004
There are about two million things

1:48:00.391 --> 1:48:02.632
that can still go wrong with this stunt.

1:48:02.726 --> 1:48:07.891
Central Intelligence Agency.
Now, there's a contradiction in terms.

1:48:09.817 --> 1:48:12.650
How's the coffee, Ryan?

1:48:12.736 --> 1:48:15.648
Dallas, this is the Mystic.
Request clearance for launch.

1:48:15.739 --> 1:48:19.573
Mystic, Dallas.
You’re cleared for launch.

1:48:19.952 --> 1:48:21.738
Hatch is secured.

1:48:21.829 --> 1:48:24.320
Life support, normal.
Prelaunch checks complete.

1:48:24.415 --> 1:48:26.280
-We're ready to launch.
-Aye.

1:48:26.375 --> 1:48:28.457
-F|ood the skirt.
-Flood the skirt. Aye.

1:48:28.544 --> 1:48:33.004
Skirt's filled and equalized.
Soft seal. Ready to lift off.

1:48:33.090 --> 1:48:35.752
Okay. Let's do it.

1:48:37.011 --> 1:48:38.842
We're off.

1:48:39.263 --> 1:48:41.549
Thrusting port.

1:49:01.785 --> 1:49:05.994
-Six hundred yards and closing.
-Steer right to course 0-7-5.

1:49:06.707 --> 1:49:08.117
Four hundred.

1:49:12.337 --> 1:49:14.703
Two hundred yards.

1:49:16.050 --> 1:49:18.336
One hundred yards.

1:49:25.142 --> 1:49:27.303
Hit the lights.

1:49:40.491 --> 1:49:44.780
Jesus, that's a big sucker.

1:49:59.426 --> 1:50:03.635
-Okay, we're in position.
-You can open the hatch.

1:50:04.264 --> 1:50:06.630
Hold it a second. Jonesy.

1:50:09.103 --> 1:50:10.934
Mr Ryan.

1:50:13.899 --> 1:50:16.106
He's defecting.

1:50:16.568 --> 1:50:21.437
-And he can't change his mind?
-He's not going to change his mind.

1:50:21.532 --> 1:50:24.649
You willing to bet your life on that?

1:50:44.221 --> 1:50:47.213
-Sir, could you hand me that hammer?
-Yeah.

1:51:09.913 --> 1:51:11.574
Americans.

1:52:55.477 --> 1:52:57.013
He's turning green.

1:53:19.876 --> 1:53:21.992
What's so funny?

1:53:23.505 --> 1:53:27.293
The captain seems to think
you're some sort of cowboy.

1:53:28.677 --> 1:53:30.042
You speak Russian.

1:53:31.763 --> 1:53:33.719
A little.

1:53:35.392 --> 1:53:38.850
It's wise to study
the ways of one's adversary.

1:53:38.937 --> 1:53:40.723
Don't you think?

1:53:41.898 --> 1:53:43.513
It is.

1:53:45.736 --> 1:53:46.816
I doubt you'd remember,

1:53:46.903 --> 1:53:50.771
but we met once
at the Consulate in Leningrad.

1:53:50.866 --> 1:53:53.733
Along with your wife. I'm very sorry.

1:53:56.747 --> 1:54:00.535
What gives you the right
to fire on my ship?

1:54:01.501 --> 1:54:05.289
-Your signal said nothing of a torpedo.
-Ryan.

1:54:07.174 --> 1:54:10.587
It was necessary
to maintain the illusion for your crew.

1:54:10.677 --> 1:54:14.215
-My crew are being rescued, yes?
-As we speak.

1:54:19.061 --> 1:54:21.973
-You sent the signal.
-That's correct, sir.

1:54:24.274 --> 1:54:28.984
Then how did you know
our reactor accident was false?

1:54:30.280 --> 1:54:33.238
That was a guess,
but it seemed logical.

1:54:40.207 --> 1:54:41.993
Very well.

1:54:45.587 --> 1:54:50.707
I present you the ballistic
missile submarine Red October.

1:54:55.472 --> 1:55:01.513
My officers and I request asylum
in the United States of America.

1:55:04.481 --> 1:55:09.350
It's a pleasure, sir.
Bart Mancuso, USS Dallas.

1:55:11.863 --> 1:55:14.650
Torpedo. The Americans
are shooting at us again.

1:55:14.741 --> 1:55:18.700
The pitch is too high.
The torpedo's Russian.

1:55:18.912 --> 1:55:21.403
What do you mean another torpedo?
Where the hell did it come from?

1:55:21.498 --> 1:55:25.741
Conn, Sonar. New contact. Sierra 4-1.
Alfa class Soviet submarine.

1:55:29.131 --> 1:55:31.087
Why don't I have a detonation?

1:55:31.174 --> 1:55:33.039
The weapon enabled
on the far side of the target.

1:55:33.135 --> 1:55:35.501
It passed Red October before arming.

1:55:35.595 --> 1:55:39.713
Fire again with the right settings
and reload both tubes.

1:55:39.808 --> 1:55:41.139
Get me power.

1:55:41.226 --> 1:55:45.139
-Get that damn thing off my boat.
-It's off.

1:55:45.230 --> 1:55:47.767
I think somebody shot a torpedo at us.

1:55:47.858 --> 1:55:50.975
-No shit, buckwheat. Get out of here.
-Where am I...

1:55:59.077 --> 1:56:01.113
The Captain is fighting them.

1:56:01.204 --> 1:56:04.947
The Captain is fighting the Americans.
The Captain is fighting the Americans.

1:56:06.001 --> 1:56:08.663
Borodin, fire control.

1:56:09.546 --> 1:56:14.256
-Ryan. Sit here.
-I'm not a naval officer. I'm with the CIA.

1:56:14.342 --> 1:56:16.207
-CIA?
-I'm not an agent.

1:56:16.303 --> 1:56:18.965
I just write books for the CIA.

1:56:19.723 --> 1:56:22.385
Whatever. Sit down.
And do exactly what I tell you.

1:56:22.476 --> 1:56:23.841
DS RVs away.

1:56:23.935 --> 1:56:26.597
There's a Russian Alfa
8,000 yards to starboard.

1:56:26.688 --> 1:56:28.724
I think it's the Konovalov.

1:56:28.815 --> 1:56:31.727
-Increase the flank.
-Increase the flank.

1:56:32.235 --> 1:56:36.774
-How?
-That knob. Turn right full.

1:56:38.241 --> 1:56:40.607
All ahead flank. Right full rudder.

1:56:40.702 --> 1:56:43.569
-He's shooting again, sir.
-Go to battle stations.

1:56:43.663 --> 1:56:47.497
-Battle stations.
-Chief of Watch, man battle stations.

1:56:50.629 --> 1:56:54.042
Torpedo in the water. Bearing 3-1-5.

1:56:54.132 --> 1:56:58.375
-Make range 7,000 yards.
-Steer right 3-1-5.

1:56:58.470 --> 1:57:02.179
-That's heading into the torpedo.
-Steady, bearing still 3-1-5.

1:57:02.265 --> 1:57:05.678
-Estimated range, 6,000 yards.
-Still 3-1-5.

1:57:05.769 --> 1:57:08.351
Steer right till this reads 3-1-5.

1:57:08.438 --> 1:57:12.431
No, that's wrong.
Ryan, don't turn that god damn wheel.

1:57:13.276 --> 1:57:15.608
3-1-5.

1:57:26.456 --> 1:57:29.414
You're heading straight
into that torpedo.

1:57:29.501 --> 1:57:32.368
-Yes.
-Doing what?

1:57:32.462 --> 1:57:35.044
-He's turned into the torpedo's path.
-What?

1:57:35.131 --> 1:57:38.339
Red October's turned directly
into the torpedo's path, sir.

1:57:38.426 --> 1:57:40.166
Mother of God.

1:57:40.554 --> 1:57:43.921
Torpedo steady, bearing 3-1-5.
Range, 5,000 yards.

1:57:44.015 --> 1:57:46.006
Melekhin, more speed.

1:57:46.101 --> 1:57:49.059
Negative.
We are already running 110%.

1:57:49.145 --> 1:57:50.885
Then get me 115%.

1:57:50.981 --> 1:57:55.315
Estimate range 3,000 yards.
Closing awfully fast.

1:58:01.533 --> 1:58:04.570
He's heading right into the torpedo.
What's he trying to do, kill himself?

1:58:04.661 --> 1:58:06.697
We have a firing solution
on the Russian Alfa.

1:58:06.788 --> 1:58:08.779
-Can we shoot back?
-They didn't shoot at us.

1:58:08.873 --> 1:58:12.661
I can't attack a Soviet submarine
without authorisation.

1:58:15.297 --> 1:58:20.212
Torpedo bearing, steady at 3-1-5.
Best range, 900 yards.

1:58:21.511 --> 1:58:24.969
Torpedo impact, 20 seconds.

1:58:26.558 --> 1:58:28.344
What books?

1:58:29.477 --> 1:58:32.969
-Pardon me?
-What books did you write?

1:58:33.940 --> 1:58:37.524
I wrote a biography on Admiral Halsey
called The Fighting Sailor,

1:58:37.611 --> 1:58:40.273
about naval combat tactics.

1:58:40.363 --> 1:58:41.944
I know this book.

1:58:42.032 --> 1:58:43.112
Torpedo impact...

1:58:43.199 --> 1:58:44.939
Your conclusions were all wrong, Ryan.

1:58:45.035 --> 1:58:48.198
-Ten seconds.
-Halsey acted stupidly.

1:58:48.288 --> 1:58:53.624
Nine, eight, seven, six,

1:58:53.710 --> 1:58:58.545
five, four, three, two...

1:58:59.132 --> 1:59:01.623
Torpedo impact...

1:59:01.718 --> 1:59:03.549
Now.

1:59:12.103 --> 1:59:15.015
I'll be damned.

1:59:15.982 --> 1:59:19.440
-What happened?
-Combat tactics, Mr Ryan.

1:59:20.737 --> 1:59:22.147
By turning into the torpedo,

1:59:22.238 --> 1:59:26.026
the captain closed the distance
before it could arm itself.

1:59:26.951 --> 1:59:29.818
-So that's it?
-Not quite.

1:59:29.913 --> 1:59:31.653
Right now, Captain Tupolev

1:59:31.748 --> 1:59:34.535
is removing the safety features
on all his weapons.

1:59:34.626 --> 1:59:37.538
He won't make the same mistake twice.

1:59:38.088 --> 1:59:43.833
-Vasily, have you plotted a solution yet?
-Aye, Captain. It's a little rough, but I...

1:59:49.265 --> 1:59:52.553
-Gunfire?
-That's what it sounded like, sir.

1:59:52.644 --> 1:59:55.511
-Won't change his mind?
-It's one of the crew.

1:59:55.605 --> 1:59:59.097
Whoever he is,
he's having second thoughts.

2:00:16.543 --> 2:00:19.751
I would like to have seen Montana.

2:00:33.101 --> 2:00:35.888
Captain, he stumbled fonNard
into the missile bay.

2:00:35.979 --> 2:00:39.346
There's a silo hatch warning
port side, number 20.

2:00:39.441 --> 2:00:43.229
-He can't launch a missile.
-No, but he can blow one up.

2:00:45.822 --> 2:00:48.780
-Captain, take the conn.
-Fire control's blasted to hell.

2:00:48.867 --> 2:00:52.405
-Then get behind him and stay there.
-Captain, wait.

2:00:56.166 --> 2:00:59.078
You may need this, sir.

2:01:01.838 --> 2:01:03.499
Thank you.

2:01:07.135 --> 2:01:09.547
Don't just stand there, Ryan.
Go with him!

2:01:09.637 --> 2:01:11.423
-You, you speak English?
-Yes, sir.

2:01:11.514 --> 2:01:12.845
Get your butt over here.

2:01:12.932 --> 2:01:15.218
Captain, torpedo broke off on impact.

2:01:15.310 --> 2:01:18.302
Set the safety ranges for zero.

2:01:18.396 --> 2:01:20.102
I cannot go any faster.

2:01:20.190 --> 2:01:23.899
We must get him
before he gets to the ignition circuits.

2:01:31.868 --> 2:01:34.951
What happens
if he gets to that ignition circuitry?

2:01:35.038 --> 2:01:37.905
He can incinerate the ship.

2:01:45.673 --> 2:01:48.380
Is that door the only way out of here?

2:01:49.719 --> 2:01:50.879
Yes.

2:01:51.513 --> 2:01:53.595
Don't let him get past you.

2:01:54.432 --> 2:01:58.266
Ryan. Be careful what you shoot at.

2:01:59.646 --> 2:02:04.891
Most things in here
don't react too well to bullets.

2:02:06.486 --> 2:02:08.101
Right.

2:02:26.548 --> 2:02:29.915
I have to be careful what I shoot at?

2:02:37.559 --> 2:02:39.095
Safety ranges set to zero.

2:02:39.185 --> 2:02:41.221
Sonar, give me
the bearing for Red October.

2:02:41.312 --> 2:02:43.143
She's positioned behind us.

2:02:43.231 --> 2:02:46.564
Right full rudder!
I'll shake the man loose.

2:02:53.783 --> 2:02:56.195
-He's going deep.
-Thirty degree down angle!

2:02:56.286 --> 2:02:58.868
All the countermeasures
were over there, right?

2:02:58.955 --> 2:02:59.990
Very well.

2:03:25.481 --> 2:03:29.474
Admiral, the Alfa's too quick.
It's only a matter of time.

2:03:30.153 --> 2:03:34.613
"Ryan, some things in here
don't react well to bullets."

2:03:34.699 --> 2:03:38.362
Yeah. Like me.
I don't react well to bullets.

2:03:57.972 --> 2:04:00.338
-Where's he now?
-Close, sir.

2:04:03.436 --> 2:04:06.599
-Nine hundred metres, directly ahead.
-Got him.

2:04:06.689 --> 2:04:09.601
-Match bearings and fire.
-We are too close!

2:04:09.692 --> 2:04:11.774
Don't argue. Launch the weapon.

2:04:11.861 --> 2:04:13.692
The torpedoes are armed
in the tubes! You cannot...

2:04:13.780 --> 2:04:15.611
Do it now!

2:04:18.034 --> 2:04:22.073
Another torpedo. It went active
the moment it was launched.

2:04:22.163 --> 2:04:24.279
Left full rudder.
Ease off on your bow planes.

2:04:24.374 --> 2:04:26.490
I think he's got us.

2:04:36.052 --> 2:04:38.885
Way to go, Dallas!

2:04:42.809 --> 2:04:45.596
Torpedo is in acquisition.
Range 500 yards and closing.

2:04:45.687 --> 2:04:49.430
-You've done it, Mr Thompson!
-I hope this works.

2:04:49.899 --> 2:04:52.106
Chief, put us on the roof.

2:04:52.193 --> 2:04:55.936
Countermeasure station, on my mark.
Five, four...

2:04:58.825 --> 2:05:02.317
One. Release countermeasures.
Emergency blow!

2:05:02.412 --> 2:05:04.027
Full rise. Fair water plane.

2:05:09.752 --> 2:05:14.041
Six hundred feet, 550, 500 feet.

2:05:14.882 --> 2:05:18.124
-Four-fifty.
-Come on, big D. Fly.

2:05:31.691 --> 2:05:34.774
Captain scared 'em out of the water!

2:05:37.196 --> 2:05:40.814
That torpedo's still active.
It's searching for another target.

2:06:06.350 --> 2:06:08.432
A goddamn cook!

2:06:37.090 --> 2:06:38.705
How close is that Alfa, Jonesy?

2:06:38.800 --> 2:06:42.088
-Thousand yards, going to port.
-Reverse your turn.

2:06:48.684 --> 2:06:52.723
We're turning straight at him.
Torpedo's still on our tail.

2:06:57.026 --> 2:07:00.894
The hard part about playing chicken
is knowing when to flinch.

2:07:06.619 --> 2:07:10.658
Collision in 400 yards, 350, 300...

2:07:10.748 --> 2:07:12.659
Captain!

2:07:12.750 --> 2:07:15.457
Right full rudder, 30 degree down angle.

2:07:15.545 --> 2:07:18.708
Aye, sir. This one's going to be close.

2:07:23.219 --> 2:07:27.132
-Torpedo dead ahead!
-You arrogant ass. You've killed us.

2:07:55.209 --> 2:07:59.327
We have ascertained
the Red October's ﬁnal position,

2:07:59.755 --> 2:08:01.666
but given the depth of the water

2:08:01.757 --> 2:08:04.965
and the fact that the wreckage
spreads across a wide area,

2:08:05.052 --> 2:08:07.839
it'll be some time
before anything's recovered.

2:08:07.930 --> 2:08:09.136
However, your people are

2:08:09.515 --> 2:08:10.595
interviewing the crew now

2:08:10.683 --> 2:08:13.470
and making arrangements
for their return.

2:08:14.770 --> 2:08:18.137
This has been
a terrible tragedy, Mr Ambassador.

2:08:18.441 --> 2:08:21.353
And I can only stress
that if you'd come to us earlier

2:08:21.444 --> 2:08:23.776
it might have been avoided.

2:08:24.864 --> 2:08:29.654
-I appreciate your candour in the matter.
-And Iyours, Andrei.

2:08:33.623 --> 2:08:34.578
Perhaps in the future

2:08:34.665 --> 2:08:39.876
technology will allow a more
thorough investigation of the wreckage.

2:08:39.962 --> 2:08:41.793
Perhaps.

2:08:47.553 --> 2:08:49.919
There is another matter...

2:08:50.014 --> 2:08:52.847
-One that I'm reluctant to...
-Please.

2:08:55.478 --> 2:08:57.514
One of our submarines, an Alfa,

2:08:57.605 --> 2:09:01.939
was last reported
in the area of the Grand Banks.

2:09:02.610 --> 2:09:06.102
We have not heard from her
for some time.

2:09:07.907 --> 2:09:09.443
Andrei.

2:09:10.576 --> 2:09:13.989
You've lost another submarine?

2:09:27.510 --> 2:09:31.970
All this way
to hide a submarine in a river.

2:09:32.932 --> 2:09:35.264
We're 100 miles
from the nearest naval base,

2:09:35.351 --> 2:09:38.434
the last place that
satellites will ever look.

2:09:40.523 --> 2:09:43.185
I grew up around here.

2:09:44.986 --> 2:09:49.446
My grandfather taught me to fish
off that island right over there.

2:09:52.868 --> 2:09:56.281
There's one question
you haven't asked me yet.

2:09:58.040 --> 2:09:59.576
VVhy?

2:10:01.711 --> 2:10:04.874
I figured you would tell me
when you were ready.

2:10:08.050 --> 2:10:12.589
Now, there are those who believe
we should attack the United States first,

2:10:12.680 --> 2:10:17.891
settle everything in one moment.
Red October was built for that purpose.

2:10:19.562 --> 2:10:20.893
When the dust settles from this,

2:10:20.980 --> 2:10:23.141
there's going to be
hell to pay in Moscow.

2:10:23.232 --> 2:10:27.271
Perhaps. Maybe something good
will come from it.

2:10:28.404 --> 2:10:32.898
A little revolution, now and then,
is a healthy thing, don't you think?

2:10:39.915 --> 2:10:42.873
Do you still like to fish, Ryan?

2:10:45.254 --> 2:10:48.997
There's a river, not unlike this one,
near Vilnius,

2:10:49.091 --> 2:10:52.049
where my grandfather taught me to fish.

2:10:54.930 --> 2:10:59.674
"And the sea will grant
each man new hope

2:10:59.769 --> 2:11:04.229
"as sleep brings dreams of home."

2:11:09.779 --> 2:11:12.316
Christopher Columbus.

2:11:16.452 --> 2:11:19.159
Welcome to the New World, sir.

2:11:28.422 --> 2:11:30.504
Everything all right, sir?
