WEBVTT

00:01.260 --> 00:03.091
- PREVIOUSLY ON PSYCH...

00:03.130 --> 00:05.064
- HE'S AN ART THIEF?
- A DANGEROUS ART THIEF.

00:05.100 --> 00:06.397
ALL RIGHT,
NEVER BEEN CAUGHT,

00:06.440 --> 00:07.293
NEVER LEFI' ENOUGH EVIDENCE
TO BE ACCUSED.

00:07.340 --> 00:09.729
- BUT WE DID FIND
A BURNING CIGARETTE

00:09.770 --> 00:13.706
IN THE ASH TRAY OVER THERE.
- THIS IS MY GUN.

00:13.740 --> 00:17.073
YOU SEE, A GENTLEMAN OF LEISURE
NEVER PACKS HIS WEAPON

00:17.110 --> 00:18.805
NEXT TO HIS SOCKS.

00:18.850 --> 00:21.068
- HELLO, DESPEREAUX.

00:21.120 --> 00:22.417
- I'VE OFI'EN FANTASIZED

00:22.450 --> 00:23.417
ABOUT ESCAPING FROM PRISON,
YOU KNOW.

00:23.450 --> 00:26.385
- YEAH, I'M FLYING JULIET
TO NAPA FOR DINNER

00:26.420 --> 00:27.352
AND SURPRISING HER
WITH A VACATION PLAN.

00:27.390 --> 00:29.255
THE AMALFI COAST.

00:29.290 --> 00:31.451
- THESE KIND OF TRIPS ARE
ONCE-IN-A-LIFETIME EXPERIENCES.

00:31.490 --> 00:33.629
AND THEY'RE EVEN BE'I'I'ER
WHEN YOU HAVE SOMEONE

00:33.660 --> 00:36.220
YOU CARE ABOUT
TO SHARE THEM WITH.

00:36.270 --> 00:37.726
AND YOU DO.

00:53.220 --> 00:56.189
- FIRST CLASS TICKETS?

00:56.220 --> 00:58.415
- AND THREE NIGHTS HOTEL
PAID FOR.

00:58.450 --> 00:59.417
- BY A WORLD-CLASS CRIMINAL.

00:59.460 --> 01:01.610
- PLEASE.

01:01.660 --> 01:04.254
DESPEREAUX STAGED OUR DEATHS.
THAT'S BARELY A CRIME.

01:04.290 --> 01:05.757
- I DON'T THINK YOU'RE ALLOWED
TO ACCEPT LAVISH GIFI'S

01:05.790 --> 01:07.291
FROM PEOPLE YOU SENT TO PRISON.

01:07.330 --> 01:08.592
- SAYS WHO?
THE SULTAN OF CANADA?

01:08.630 --> 01:11.360
LOOK, ALL DESPEREAUX WANTS
IS A LITTLE FACE TIME.

01:11.400 --> 01:13.197
TEN MINUTES, MAYBE LESS.

01:13.240 --> 01:16.232
HE'S LONELY, ALL BY HIMSELF
IN HIS CANADIAN PRISON,

01:16.270 --> 01:17.464
AND WE PUT HIM THERE.

01:17.510 --> 01:20.479
THE LEAST WE CAN DO IS GIVE HIM
A CHANCE TO EXPLAIN HIMSELF.

01:20.510 --> 01:21.329
- OH, SO I'M THE CRAZY ONE
FOR BEING NERVOUS

01:21.380 --> 01:22.870
ABOUT ACCEPTING AN INVITATION
TO VISIT

01:22.910 --> 01:24.309
FROM A CRIMINAL
WHO ALMOST KILLED US?

01:24.350 --> 01:25.772
- THAT LITTLE GUN
HE POINTED AT MY HEAD...

01:25.810 --> 01:27.448
- TWICE.
- NOT LOADED.

01:27.480 --> 01:28.447
- HOW DO YOU KNOW?

01:28.480 --> 01:30.619
- HE TOLD ME.

01:30.650 --> 01:32.550
- YOU SPOKE TO HIM
BEFORE THIS?

01:32.590 --> 01:34.478
- I FOLLOW HIM ON TWITTER.

01:34.520 --> 01:35.555
- OH, MY GOSH.

01:35.590 --> 01:37.751
- GUS, COME ON.

01:37.790 --> 01:39.291
BE A LITTLE SPONTANEOUS.

01:39.330 --> 01:41.150
CANADA'S ONE OF THE TOP
50 COUNTRIES IN THE WORLD.

01:41.200 --> 01:42.292
- AND HOW MANY COUNTRIES
ARE THERE?

01:42.330 --> 01:43.797
- AT LEAST 50.
MAYBE MORE.

01:43.830 --> 01:45.798
YOU HAVE EXACTLY
FOUR HOURS

01:45.830 --> 01:47.388
TO COME UP WITH A GOOD LIE
FOR YOUR BOSS.

01:47.440 --> 01:49.704
WE'RE GOING TO CANADA, MAN.

01:49.740 --> 01:51.901
YOU ARE GONNA BE IN CANADA.
WHAT?

01:51.940 --> 01:53.771
- [sighs]

01:53.810 --> 01:55.471
I'M NOT GONNA BAIL YOU OUT
THIS TIME.

01:55.510 --> 01:56.807
- I'M NOT GONNA ASK YOU TO.

01:56.850 --> 01:58.374
- GOOD, 'CAUSE YOU GOT
MY ONLY SUITCASE.

01:58.410 --> 02:00.275
- SEE YOU MONDAY, POP.
- YOU TELL HER YET?

02:00.320 --> 02:03.812
- TELL WHO WHAT?
- OH, COME ON, SHAWN.

02:03.850 --> 02:05.340
I OVERHEARD
THE WHOLE CONVERSATION

02:05.390 --> 02:07.551
WITH GUS ABOUT JULIET
GOING OFF ON THIS TRIP

02:07.590 --> 02:09.478
WITH DECLAN RAND AND HOW
YOU'RE GONNA TRY TO WOW HER

02:09.530 --> 02:10.929
AND TELL HER HOW MUCH YOU CARE
ABOUT HER

02:10.960 --> 02:13.258
BEFORE SHE GETS TOO SERIOUS,
BLAH, BLAH, BLAH, BLAH.

02:13.300 --> 02:15.325
- I SHARED THAT WITH GUS
IN THE MEN'S ROOM

02:15.360 --> 02:16.668
AT THE RED ROBIN.
WHERE WERE YOU HIDING?

02:16.700 --> 02:18.520
- YOU BUTT-DIALED ME.

02:18.570 --> 02:19.537
- AND YOU LISTENED?

02:19.570 --> 02:23.666
- SHAWN, I'VE SPOILED MY SHARE
OF RELATIONSHIPS

02:23.710 --> 02:26.201
OVER THE YEARS
BY KEEPING MY MOUTH SHUT.

02:26.240 --> 02:27.935
TELL HER.
TELL HER NOW.

02:27.980 --> 02:29.709
TELL HER FIVE MINUTES
FROM NOW.

02:29.750 --> 02:31.377
SHE GOES OFF TO ITALY

02:31.410 --> 02:34.811
WITH A GUY WHO'S RICH,
WHO IS CRAZY ABOUT HER,

02:34.850 --> 02:37.512
SHE AIN'T COMING BACK
WITH ANY DOUBTS.

02:40.360 --> 02:42.248
- DAD?
- YEAH, SHAWN.

02:42.290 --> 02:44.656
- CAN WE NEVER HAVE
THIS CONVERSATION AGAIN?

02:44.690 --> 02:46.396
- WE CAN CERTAINLY TRY.

02:51.830 --> 02:54.697
- BUZZ, HEY,
HAVE YOU SEEN JULIET?

02:54.740 --> 02:56.469
- NO. NO.
- REALLY?

02:56.510 --> 02:57.829
CRAP.

02:57.870 --> 02:59.201
- YOU OKAY?

02:59.240 --> 03:00.798
- YEAH, NO.
YEAH.

03:00.840 --> 03:02.501
I'M ABOUT TO GO MEET THIS GUY
I PUT IN PRISON.

03:02.550 --> 03:04.404
I HAVE A PLANE TO CATCH,

03:04.450 --> 03:07.339
AND I REALLY WANTED TO--
I WANTED TO TELL HER SOMETHING.

03:07.380 --> 03:08.870
- WELL, I CAN TAKE A MESSAGE.

03:08.920 --> 03:10.547
- NO, IT'S NOT REALLY THE KIND
OF THING

03:10.590 --> 03:11.511
YOU PUT IN MESSAGE FORM.

03:11.550 --> 03:13.415
- I'M A GREAT LISTENER.

03:13.460 --> 03:15.485
WHY DON'T WE GIVE IT
A DRY RUN?

03:18.330 --> 03:19.627
- ALL RIGHT.

03:19.660 --> 03:21.218
CAN'T HURT.

03:21.260 --> 03:23.319
IT'S A LITTLE WEIRD, BUT...

03:23.370 --> 03:25.793
YOU SEE, THE THING IS, I WANT
TO TELL HER THAT I LIKE HER.

03:25.830 --> 03:27.639
- I KIND OF SUSPECTED.

03:27.670 --> 03:29.809
- YEAH?

03:29.840 --> 03:31.535
IT'S REALLY MORE THAN LIKE.

03:31.570 --> 03:33.970
YEAH, YOU KNOW,
SO MUCH HAS HAPPENED,

03:34.010 --> 03:36.001
AND YOU ALWAYS THINK THERE'S
GONNA BE ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY,

03:36.040 --> 03:37.507
BUT SOMETIMES THERE ISN'T.

03:37.550 --> 03:39.518
AND WHAT I'VE REALIZED--

03:39.550 --> 03:41.768
WHAT I'VE REALIZED IS THAT
I DON'T WANT TO WAIT ANYMORE.

03:41.820 --> 03:43.981
I CAN'T WAIT.

03:44.020 --> 03:47.478
NOT WITH THIS KIND OF STUFF,
YOU KNOW?

03:47.520 --> 03:50.353
- HOLY CRAP,
THAT WAS GREAT.

03:50.390 --> 03:52.426
- REALLY?

03:52.460 --> 03:54.257
- YEAH.

03:54.300 --> 03:56.962
- NO, BUZZ, BUZZ,
DON'T--DON'T WRITE THIS.

03:57.000 --> 03:59.560
I'M JUST SORT OF TALKING IT OUT
FOR MYSELF

03:59.600 --> 04:02.933
AND YOU APPARENTLY.

04:02.970 --> 04:05.461
DUDE, YOU ADDRESSED THAT
TO CHIEF VICK.

04:05.510 --> 04:08.001
- I DID?
OH.

04:08.040 --> 04:09.974
BULLET DODGED.
- SUPER WEIRD.

04:10.010 --> 04:11.477
THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN...

04:11.510 --> 04:15.469
- OH, IT'S FRIDAY TODAY,
ISN'T IT?

04:15.520 --> 04:16.782
- YEAH, FRIDAY.
YEAH.

04:16.820 --> 04:19.812
- OH, SHE ASKED ME TO GET
HER PASSPORT UPDATED.

04:19.860 --> 04:20.986
SHE NEEDED IT TODAY.

04:21.020 --> 04:22.658
- SHE ALREADY LEFT?

04:22.690 --> 04:24.282
- I THINK SO.

04:35.570 --> 04:37.709
- OKAY, YOU'RE FREAKING OUT
ABOUT SOMETHING.

04:37.740 --> 04:39.378
YOU WERE QUIET
THE ENTIRE FLIGHT,

04:39.410 --> 04:41.378
AND YOU WATCHED THE BACK-UP PLAN
ALL THE WAY THROUGH.

04:41.410 --> 04:43.549
ARE YOU OKAY?
- I ACCIDENTALLY TURNED MCNAB

04:43.580 --> 04:45.502
AND MY FATHER
INTO CONFIDANTS.

04:45.550 --> 04:47.575
IT WAS A WEIRD DAY.

04:47.620 --> 04:52.455
BUT I REALIZE THIS IS THE LIFE
I'M MEANT FOR.

04:52.490 --> 04:54.481
- VISITING MINIMUM SECURITY
CANADIAN JAILS?

04:54.520 --> 04:56.954
- EXACTLY.
OH, TRUST ME, GUS.

04:56.990 --> 04:59.697
WE HEAR DESPEREAUX'S PITCH,
AND IT'S SMOKED SALMON,

04:59.730 --> 05:03.461
POUTINE, AND COFFEE CRISP
FROM HERE ON OUT.

05:03.500 --> 05:06.469
WHOA.
- GO ON.

05:06.500 --> 05:07.967
- GENTLEMEN.

05:08.000 --> 05:09.467
- PRISON LOOKS GOOD ON YOU.

05:09.510 --> 05:11.034
- YOU CALL IT PRISON,

05:11.070 --> 05:13.800
I LIKEN IT
TO A MID-RANGE SANDALS RESORT.

05:13.840 --> 05:16.673
I ONLY KNOW THAT BECAUSE
I ONCE STOLE A CRUISE SHIP

05:16.710 --> 05:18.507
FROM A TINY CARIBBEAN PORT.

05:18.550 --> 05:20.575
- WHICH PORT?
- WHY ARE WE HERE?

05:20.620 --> 05:23.111
- MY APOLOGIES
FOR THE SHORT NOTICE.

05:23.150 --> 05:26.517
BUT I'VE HAD A BIT
OF A REALIZATION.

05:26.560 --> 05:28.482
AND I HAVE SOME THINGS
I NEED TO TELL YOU FACE TO FACE.

05:28.520 --> 05:29.521
YOU SEE, SHAWN,

05:29.560 --> 05:32.427
MY LIFE'S GOAL
HAS ALWAYS BEEN

05:32.460 --> 05:34.553
TO COMMIT THE PERFECT CRIME.

05:34.600 --> 05:38.092
I'VE ALWAYS THOUGHT
OF MY HEISTS AS...

05:38.130 --> 05:40.462
ELEGANT.
VICTIM LESS.

05:40.500 --> 05:44.459
BUT YOU MADE ME FEEL SOMEHOW...

05:44.510 --> 05:46.478
REGRIIETFU L.

05:46.510 --> 05:49.138
- YOU GENUINELY WANTED ME
TO BE THE GREATEST THIEF

05:49.180 --> 05:50.147
THAT EVER LIVED.

05:50.180 --> 05:52.740
- YOU KNOW, THAT'S RIGHT.

05:52.780 --> 05:55.044
- WELL, GENTLEMEN,

05:55.080 --> 05:57.719
I NEED YOU TO KNOW

05:57.750 --> 05:59.115
THAT I AM CAPABLE

05:59.150 --> 06:02.119
OF ALL THE THINGS
YOU THOUGHT I COULD DO

06:02.160 --> 06:03.923
AND MORE.

06:03.960 --> 06:07.054
AND I'D LIKE THE OPPORTUNITY

06:07.100 --> 06:08.158
TO PROVE IT TO YOU.

06:08.200 --> 06:09.519
- YOU DON'T HAVE TO PROVE TO US

06:09.570 --> 06:10.525
THAT YOU'RE A GREAT CRIMINAL.

06:10.570 --> 06:11.628
- I WANT TO.

06:11.670 --> 06:14.366
- YOU SHOULDN'T.
- BUT I WILL.

06:18.570 --> 06:20.504
- WELL, THAT WAS THE WEIRDEST
26 MINUTES OF MY LIFE.

06:20.540 --> 06:22.508
- HONESTLY, I FEEL
A LITTLE BAD FOR HIM.

06:22.550 --> 06:23.778
- WHY?

06:23.810 --> 06:25.107
- HE HAD THIS REPUTATION
OF BEING ABLE

06:25.150 --> 06:26.742
TO GET IN AND OUT OF ANYTHING.

06:26.780 --> 06:28.577
I SPOILED IT FOR HIM.

06:28.620 --> 06:29.780
I FEEL SOME RESPONSIBILITY
FOR THAT, GUS.

06:29.820 --> 06:32.186
PLUS, HE FELT--
HE FELT NEEDY, YOU KNOW?

06:32.220 --> 06:33.585
I MEAN, WHAT DOES HE CARE
WHAT I THINK?

06:33.620 --> 06:34.951
- HE WAS EXPOSED
FOR WHAT HE WAS.

06:34.990 --> 06:36.014
THAT'S ALL.
- GUS, DON'T BE

06:36.060 --> 06:37.186
BOTH ASHLEE SIMPSON ALBUMS.

06:37.230 --> 06:38.879
- THERE WERE THREE
ASHLEE SIMPSON ALBUMS.

06:38.930 --> 06:39.999
- THAT CAN'T POSSIBLY BE TRUE.

06:40.030 --> 06:41.452
- AUTOBIOGRAPHY,
BITTERSWEET--

06:41.500 --> 06:42.524
- I WILL NOT DO THIS
WITH YOU RIGHT NOW.

06:42.570 --> 06:44.561
- GET IT RIGHT IF YOU'RE GONNA
CRITICIZE ME THEN.

06:44.600 --> 06:47.728
- WELL, I THINK
THAT WENT WELL.

[The Friendly Indians'

OUT OF PRISON?

07:40.860 --> 07:42.885
- I DID NOT.
- CALM YOURSELF, GUS.

07:42.930 --> 07:44.921
SHAWN HAD NOTHING
TO DO WITH THIS.

07:44.960 --> 07:47.929
I NEEDED A VISITOR
TO MAKE MY ESCAPE WORK.

07:47.960 --> 07:49.791
THERE'S A SECURITY HOLE
IN THE WALK

07:49.830 --> 07:51.866
FROM THE VISITATION ROOM
TO THE CELL BLOCK.

07:51.900 --> 07:53.162
- I'M TURNING THIS CAR AROUND
RIGHT NOW.

07:53.200 --> 07:54.963
- I WOULDN'T DO THAT
IF I WERE YOU.

07:55.000 --> 07:57.036
I HAVE THIS SMALL,
SOMEWHAT IMPRESSIVE SHIV

07:57.070 --> 07:58.958
THAT I LEARNED TO MAKE
FROM ONE OF 30 PRISONERS

07:59.010 --> 08:01.001
NAMED GORD,
AND I'M IN THE POSITION,

08:01.040 --> 08:02.871
UNFORTUNATELY,
WHERE I WOULD HAVE TO USE IT.

08:02.910 --> 08:04.104
- I'M GONNA KILL YOU,
SHAWN.

08:04.150 --> 08:05.344
- I GIVE YOU MY WORD,
THOUGH,

08:05.380 --> 08:07.871
THAT I WOULD CUT YOU IN A MANNER
THAT YOU WOULD NOT BLEED OUT

08:07.920 --> 08:11.845
TOO MUCH, AND YOUR RECOVERY
WOULD BE A MATTER OF WEEKS.

08:11.890 --> 08:13.710
- COME ON, GUS.
CONSIDERING THE CIRCUMSTANCES,

08:13.760 --> 08:14.988
I'D SAY
THAT'S PRETTY DAMN CONSIDERATE.

08:15.020 --> 08:16.624
- THANK YOU.

08:16.660 --> 08:17.729
OH, WOULD YOU BE SO GOOD

08:17.760 --> 08:19.899
AS TO TAKE THIS ROAD
TOWARD THE TOP OF THE MOUNTAINS.

08:19.930 --> 08:20.999
- THIS FIRST ONE HERE?
- YES, PLEASE.

08:21.030 --> 08:22.861
- GUS.
- I GOT IT, SHAWN.

08:25.900 --> 08:28.232
OUR LUGGAGE WAS IN THE TRUNK,
WASN'T IT?

08:28.270 --> 08:29.931
- YES, IT WAS.
- OUR WALLETS IN THE BAGS?

08:29.970 --> 08:31.528
- MM-HMM.
- PASSPORTS IN THE WALLETS.

08:31.570 --> 08:34.004
- YOU KNOW IT.
I DO HAVE THIS, THOUGH.

08:34.040 --> 08:35.109
- TWO ALTOIDS?

08:35.140 --> 08:36.676
- NO, I WISH.

08:36.710 --> 08:38.268
IT'S A PIECE OF CHALK
THAT JUST SPLIT IN HALF.

08:38.310 --> 08:41.177
- IF WE'RE OUT HERE
FOR MORE THAN TWO DAYS,

08:41.220 --> 08:42.881
I WILL EAT YOU ALIVE.
- YOU COULDN'T EAT ME.

08:42.920 --> 08:44.911
- I WILL FINISH YOU WHOLE.
- THAT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE.

08:44.950 --> 08:47.953
- I WILL EAT YOU IN MANAGEABLE,
BITE-SIZE PIECES.

08:56.130 --> 08:58.894
- 12 HOURS. 12 HOURS
OF OVERNIGHT WALKING, SHAWN.

08:58.930 --> 09:00.136
- IT WOULD HAVE BEEN SIX

09:00.170 --> 09:01.967
IF WE HADN'T STOPPED TO EAT
ALL THAT BARK.

09:02.000 --> 09:03.262
- I WAS UNDER THE IMPRESSION
IT TASTES LIKE MAPLE SYRUP.

09:03.310 --> 09:06.199
- [gaSPS]
MACKINTOSH!

09:06.240 --> 09:07.605
- OH, NO.

09:07.640 --> 09:08.937
NO.

09:08.980 --> 09:10.948
NO.
SORRY, GUYS, BUT NO.

09:10.980 --> 09:12.242
- WE HAVEN'T ASKED YOU ANYTHING.

09:12.280 --> 09:15.716
- GUYS, LISTEN,
YOU KNOW THAT I LIKE YOU A LOT,

09:15.750 --> 09:17.308
BUT THE LAST TIME
THAT YOU WERE HERE,

09:17.350 --> 09:18.749
YOU GOT ME FIRED.

09:18.790 --> 09:20.087
- TECH NICALLY,
YOU GOT YOURSELF FIRED.

09:20.120 --> 09:21.758
- BY DOING WHAT YOU ASKED.

09:21.790 --> 09:22.950
- WE GOT YOU YOUR JOB BACK.

09:22.990 --> 09:24.719
- AT THE LOWEST POSSIBLE LEVEL.

09:24.760 --> 09:26.022
- A JOB.
WE GOT YOU A JOB BACK.

09:26.060 --> 09:28.858
I DIDN'T KNOW YOU WANTED
YOUR ORIGINAL JOB BACK.

09:28.900 --> 09:30.720
NOW THAT I KNOW THAT,
I'LL GET RIGHT TO WORK ON IT.

09:30.770 --> 09:32.897
- [sighs]
I JUST CLAWED MY WAY UP

09:32.940 --> 09:34.032
FROM TRAFFIC DUTY, OKAY?

09:34.070 --> 09:36.903
SO, PLEASE, DON'T ASK ME
TO DO ANYTHING ILLEGAL AGAIN.

09:36.940 --> 09:38.305
- AFRAID I CAN'T PROMISE THAT,

09:38.340 --> 09:39.932
BUT WHAT I CAN DO IS GIVE YOU
THE ANONYMOUS TIP

09:39.980 --> 09:41.607
OF THE CENTURY.
- [sighs]

09:41.640 --> 09:42.868
- I HAVE SENSED
THAT PIERRE DESPEREAUX

09:42.910 --> 09:44.969
IS GOING TO ESCAPE.

09:45.010 --> 09:47.114
- WHAT?

09:47.150 --> 09:48.970
- LET'S GO GRAB ED DYKSTRA,

09:49.020 --> 09:50.749
AND YOU CAN TAKE
ALL THE CREDIT FOR IT.

09:50.790 --> 09:53.384
- NO.
ED'S NOT HERE.

09:53.420 --> 09:55.081
NOBODY IS.

09:55.120 --> 09:56.109
OUR BEST DETECTIVE
WAS FOUND DEAD YESTERDAY

09:56.160 --> 09:57.718
AT HIS FISHING CABIN.

09:57.760 --> 09:58.988
NOBODY THINKS THIS SITS RIGHT.

09:59.030 --> 10:01.726
- WELL, WHILE THEY'RE OUT THERE
DOING THAT,

10:01.760 --> 10:05.298
WHY DON'T YOU SOLVE
THE JAILBREAK ALL BY YOURSELF?

10:05.330 --> 10:07.639
- [sighs]

10:07.670 --> 10:10.969
OKAY, I WILL CALL
THE PRISON.

10:11.010 --> 10:14.104
ALL RIGHT,
THANK YOU VERY MUCH THEN.

10:14.140 --> 10:15.129
- WELL?

10:15.180 --> 10:16.306
- ALL OF THE PRISONERS

10:16.340 --> 10:17.944
ARE ACCOUNTED FOR.
- WHAT?

10:17.980 --> 10:19.140
NO.
DID THEY ACTUALLY SEE HIM?

10:19.180 --> 10:21.944
- NO, THEY DO A ROUGH NUMBERS
COUNT IN THE A.M., SHAWN.

10:21.980 --> 10:24.016
- CALL 'EM BACK.

10:24.050 --> 10:25.779
ASK HIM IF THEY SAW HIM,
BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T.

10:25.820 --> 10:27.754
BECAUSE HE'S NOT THERE.
I GUARANTEE IT.

10:27.790 --> 10:30.258
WE GOT TO GET DOWN THERE.
- I AM NOT CALLING BACK.

10:30.290 --> 10:32.690
- ALL UNITS,
WE HAVE A REPORTED ART THEFT

10:32.730 --> 10:35.028
AT A PRIVATE HOME
IN SHAUGHNESSY.

10:35.060 --> 10:37.824
ALL AVAILABLE UNITS RESPOND.

10:42.810 --> 10:46.405
- BEEN HERE MANY TIMES BEFORE.

10:46.440 --> 10:48.931
PARTIES, FUNDRAISERS.
- YOU KNOW THE OWNERS?

10:48.980 --> 10:50.049
- OH, EVERYBODY DOES.

10:50.080 --> 10:51.945
IT'S CROWN PROSECUTOR
JOHN SANTEE.

10:51.980 --> 10:54.448
HE PROSECUTES EVERY MAJOR CASE
IN TOWN,

10:54.480 --> 10:55.879
INCLUDING MR. DESPEREAUX.

10:55.920 --> 10:57.444
NOW THAT WAS A VAN GOGH
OF SOME SORT.

10:57.490 --> 11:00.311
THIS WAS A MING VASE,
BEAUTIFUL PIECE,

11:00.360 --> 11:02.385
AND THIS WAS SOME KIND
OF EGYPTIAN STAFF THING.

11:02.420 --> 11:03.751
- THIS GUY'S LOADED.

11:03.790 --> 11:05.382
HOW MUCH DO YOU PAY
YOUR PROSECUTORS?

11:05.430 --> 11:06.988
- OH, NO, NO.
IT'S HIS WIFE.

11:07.030 --> 11:08.327
SHE HAS ALL THE MONEY.

11:08.360 --> 11:10.464
HER FAMILY,
THE WAFFLE PEOPLE.

11:10.500 --> 11:12.127
- GUS, ARE YOU THINKING
WHAT I'M THINKING?

11:12.170 --> 11:13.933
- YES, WE NEED
TO TRY THOSE WAFFLES.

11:16.170 --> 11:20.038
- WELL, DESPEREAUX
CERTAINLY PROVED HIS POINT.

11:20.080 --> 11:21.229
HE PULLED IT OFF
IN THE REAL WORLD.

11:21.280 --> 11:23.009
- WILL YOU STOP GUSHING?
- IT'S ADMIRABLE.

11:23.050 --> 11:24.972
HIS WORK IS SO CLEAN,
SO EFFECTIVE.

11:25.010 --> 11:25.840
- SHAWN.
- OBVIOUSLY,

11:25.880 --> 11:27.871
WE HAVE TO CATCH HIM.
THAT'S A GIVEN.

11:30.490 --> 11:33.084
IS THIS THE CROWN PROSECUTOR?

11:33.120 --> 11:35.008
- YEAH, YEAH.

11:37.060 --> 11:41.929
- DID THE GUARDS LOCATE
THIS DESPEREAUX CHARACTER?

11:41.960 --> 11:43.461
- NO, NOT YET, SIR.
- NOT GONNA FIND HIM.

11:43.500 --> 11:44.467
HE'S LONG GONE.

11:44.500 --> 11:45.865
MACKINTOSH HERE IS THE ONLY ONE

11:45.900 --> 11:46.798
WHO BELIEVED US.

11:46.840 --> 11:48.933
I'D LIKE YOU TO TAKE THAT
IN CONSIDERATION

11:48.970 --> 11:51.700
COME PROMOTION TIME.

11:53.410 --> 11:55.037
WAIT.
HE CAN'T BE HERE.

11:55.080 --> 11:56.900
THAT'S NOT POSSIBLE.

11:56.950 --> 11:57.905
- MACKINTOSH,

11:57.950 --> 11:59.099
CAN WE SPEAK
IN PRIVATE?

11:59.150 --> 12:00.970
DID YOU CALL?
- YES, SIR.

12:01.020 --> 12:02.271
AND THEY SAID HE WAS HERE.
- PLEASE.

12:02.320 --> 12:03.912
- I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS.

12:03.950 --> 12:05.019
- YEAH, I DON'T BELIEVE IT
EITHER.

12:05.050 --> 12:06.381
- WHERE'S OUR CAR?

12:06.420 --> 12:09.014
- WELL, I IMAGINE
IT'S IN THE PARKING LOT,

12:09.060 --> 12:10.357
WHERE IT SHOULD BE.

12:10.390 --> 12:12.449
ISN'T THIS A WONDERFUL THING?

12:12.490 --> 12:14.856
NOT A SINGLE SOUL
IN THIS PRISON

12:14.900 --> 12:17.061
HAS ANY CLUE
WHAT WE'VE DONE.

12:17.100 --> 12:21.389
- HEY, SHH.

12:21.440 --> 12:23.761
WE DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.

12:23.810 --> 12:25.835
- PERHAPS WE HAVE PULLED OFF
THE PERFECT CRIME.

12:25.870 --> 12:29.135
I MEAN, WHAT IS A BETTER ALIBI
THAN BEING IN PRISON?

12:29.180 --> 12:33.116
ENJOY THE REST
OF YOUR TRIP, SHAWN.

12:33.150 --> 12:36.881
I KNOW
OUR SECRET'S SAFE,

12:36.920 --> 12:38.911
SEEING HOW YOU COULD BE
CONSIDERED AN ACCESSORY

12:38.950 --> 12:43.978
AND SINCE YOU MERELY "SENSED"
MY ESCAPE.

12:44.030 --> 12:47.898
IT'S A VERY EFFECTIVE USE
OF PSYCHICNESS.

12:47.930 --> 12:49.966
- I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU KILLED A GUY.

12:51.570 --> 12:54.994
- I'M SURE I HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

12:55.040 --> 12:56.291
- AND NOT JUST ANY GUY.
YOU KILLED--

12:56.340 --> 12:57.500
- YOU KILLED
THE CROWN PROSECUTOR.

12:57.540 --> 12:59.030
- YEAH, HIM.

12:59.070 --> 13:00.935
IT'S NOT SO EASY
IN THE REAL WORLD, IS IT?

13:00.980 --> 13:03.972
CAN'T CONTROL
ALL THE LITTLE VARIABLES.

13:04.010 --> 13:06.001
OR DID YOU INTEND TO KILL SANTEE
ALL ALONG?

13:06.050 --> 13:07.278
WAS THAT THE JOB?

13:07.320 --> 13:09.345
- I DIDN'T KILL ANYONE.

13:09.380 --> 13:10.938
- YEAH,
THEN WHY DID THEY FIND

13:10.990 --> 13:11.809
YOUR SIGNATURE CIGARETTE
IN THE HOUSE?

13:11.850 --> 13:12.851
- WHY'D THEY FIND
YOUR FINGERPRINTS?

13:12.890 --> 13:16.451
- OH, CAMILLA PARKER BOWLES.
I'VE BEEN SET UP.

13:16.490 --> 13:18.549
- I THINK WE'RE THE ONES
THAT GOT SET UP.

13:18.590 --> 13:20.899
- SOMEBODY CAME IN AND PLANTED
THOSE THINGS

13:20.930 --> 13:22.420
AFTER I STOLE THE ART.

13:22.460 --> 13:24.018
I MEAN, NOW THEY'RE TRYING
TO PIN ME FOR MURDER.

13:24.070 --> 13:25.025
SURELY YOU CAN SEE THAT.

13:25.070 --> 13:29.291
- NOPE. NOPE.

13:29.340 --> 13:31.467
- NO.
TELL IT TO THE JUDGE.

13:31.510 --> 13:35.833
I DON'T LOVE YOU ANYMORE.

13:35.880 --> 13:38.906
- IT'S LIKE YOU'RE SPEAKING
GIBBERISH TO ME RIGHT NOW.

13:38.950 --> 13:40.872
THAT'S HOW MUCH SENSE
YOU'RE MAKING.

13:40.920 --> 13:42.979
- WHAT THE...
- LASSIE!

13:43.020 --> 13:45.318
WHAT ARE YOU DOING IN CANADA?

13:45.350 --> 13:47.056
- I SHOULD BE ASKING YOU TWO
THE SAME QUESTION.

13:47.090 --> 13:48.978
I'M HERE TO EXT RADITE DESPEREAUX
BACK TO THE STATES.

13:49.020 --> 13:50.954
- WHAT?
WHEN IS THAT HAPPENING?

13:50.990 --> 13:52.127
- IT WAS SUPPOSED
TO BE TODAY.

13:52.160 --> 13:53.957
WE GOT APPROVAL TO EXTRADITE HIM
ON MONDAY.

13:54.000 --> 13:55.922
- THAT WAS HIS PLAN.

13:55.960 --> 13:57.097
THE PERFECT ALIBI.

13:57.130 --> 13:58.597
HE'S IN JAIL.
- LEAVE THE COUNTRY.

13:58.630 --> 14:00.268
- WELL, HE'S NOT GOING
ANYWHERE NOW.

14:00.300 --> 14:03.463
NOT UNTIL THEY ELIMINATE HIM
AS A MURDER SUSPECT FIRST,

14:03.510 --> 14:05.068
WHICH MAKES NO SENSE,
BECAUSE HE'S BEEN

14:05.110 --> 14:09.103
IN PRISON
THE WHOLE TIME.

14:10.950 --> 14:12.042
- JULES.

14:12.080 --> 14:14.969
YOU CAME HERE.

14:15.020 --> 14:16.271
TO VANCOUVER.

14:16.320 --> 14:18.379
- YES.
- THAT'S WHY YOU NEEDED

14:18.420 --> 14:19.910
YOUR PASSPORT
IN SUCH A HURRY.

14:19.960 --> 14:22.110
- HOW DID YOU KNOW THAT?
ARE YOU OKAY?

14:22.160 --> 14:23.479
- YES, I AM.

14:23.530 --> 14:24.883
I NEED TO SPEAK WITH YOU,
THOUGH.

14:24.930 --> 14:26.420
YOU AND I.
BEFORE YOU HEAD OFF TO ITALY

14:26.460 --> 14:28.223
WITH DECLAN
AND GET ALL CAUGHT UP

14:28.260 --> 14:30.023
IN THE MAGIC THAT'S BARCELONA
AND THE RUNNING OF THE BULLS.

14:30.070 --> 14:31.423
- YOU DON'T KNOW
WHERE ITALY IS, RIGHT, SHAWN?

14:31.470 --> 14:33.461
- BEFORE YOU MAKE
ANY MAJOR LIFE DECISIONS,

14:33.500 --> 14:35.593
CAN WE PLEASE SIT DOWN
AND TALK?

14:35.640 --> 14:38.529
- HERE IN THE LOCKDOWN?

14:38.570 --> 14:40.174
- SURE.
- OKAY.

14:43.110 --> 14:45.101
- NOT HERE,
NOT NOW.

14:45.150 --> 14:47.516
- LATER?
- YES, LATER.

14:47.550 --> 14:49.415
WE'LL SPEAK?
- OKAY.

14:49.450 --> 14:51.441
- OKAY.

15:01.200 --> 15:03.065
- WHICH ONE?

15:03.100 --> 15:04.920
- WHICH ONE WHAT?

15:04.970 --> 15:06.961
- WHICH ONE
ARE YOU FREAKING OUT ABOUT?

15:07.000 --> 15:08.536
JULIET OR DESPEREAUX?

15:08.570 --> 15:09.969
- UM, BOTH I GUESS.

15:10.010 --> 15:12.001
- WHAT'S GOING ON WITH YOU?

15:12.040 --> 15:14.031
- THEY REALLY FOUND
FINGERPRINTS?

15:14.080 --> 15:16.036
- A LOT OF THEM, SHAWN.
WHY?

15:16.080 --> 15:18.548
- DON'T YOU THINK DESPEREAUX
WOULD HAVE WORN GLOVES?

15:31.230 --> 15:33.596
- WELCOME
TO THE GORDON MARK HOTEL.

15:33.630 --> 15:34.597
WILL YOU NEED HELP
WITH YOUR BAGS?

15:34.630 --> 15:35.949
- YES, WE WILL.

15:38.100 --> 15:39.067
- WHAT WAS THAT?

15:39.100 --> 15:40.328
- IT'S CALLED A TIP, GUS.

15:40.370 --> 15:42.691
A CANADIAN COIN.
THE DOLLARS HERE ARE COINS.

15:42.740 --> 15:44.958
- IT WAS A YORK
PEPPERMINT PATTIE, SHAWN.

15:45.010 --> 15:47.103
- WHAT?
THAT WAS WAY TOO GENEROUS.

15:47.140 --> 15:49.028
- ARE YOU SURE
WE SHOULD BE STAYING HERE?

15:49.080 --> 15:49.876
- GUS, THE ROOM
IS PAID FOR.

15:49.910 --> 15:51.468
IT WOULD BE A CRIME
NOT TO USE IT.

15:51.510 --> 15:52.738
- IT'S PAID FOR
BY A MURDERER.

15:52.780 --> 15:54.975
- ALLEGED MURDERER.
- NO. NO, SHAWN.

15:55.020 --> 15:56.578
YOU ARE NOT TURNING AROUND
ON HIM NOW, ARE YOU?

15:56.620 --> 15:58.247
- IT DOESN'T MAKE A LOT
OF SENSE, GUS.

15:58.290 --> 16:00.019
THINK ABOUT IT.
DESPEREAUX'S A PERFECT IONIST.

16:00.060 --> 16:00.981
LOOK AT HIS NAILS.

16:01.020 --> 16:03.022
THAT CRIME SCENE WAS
AS SLOPPY AS IT GETS.

16:08.400 --> 16:09.719
THAT'S WEIRD.

16:09.760 --> 16:11.022
- THEY'RE COMING FOR US.

16:11.070 --> 16:12.765
- THEY'RE NOT COMING FOR US.

16:12.800 --> 16:14.768
THIS COULD BE FOR US.

16:14.800 --> 16:16.336
- ACT NATURAL.

16:16.370 --> 16:19.032
- HEY, SHAWN,
DESPEREAUX ESCAPED.

16:19.070 --> 16:22.039
- JUST NOW?
- YES, OF COURSE, JUST NOW.

16:22.080 --> 16:23.047
- AND YOU THINK WE HELPED HIM?

16:23.080 --> 16:24.604
- WHAT? NO.

16:24.650 --> 16:26.049
WHY WOULD YOU SAY THAT?
- NO REASON.

16:26.080 --> 16:28.014
- MACKINTOSH, WHY ARE YOU
SURROUNDING US?

16:28.050 --> 16:30.382
- OH, RIGHT, ONE OF THE VISITORS
AT THE PRISON

16:30.420 --> 16:31.682
SAW HIM GET
IN THE BACK OF YOUR TRUNK.

16:31.720 --> 16:33.984
- WHAT?

16:43.300 --> 16:45.325
NO WAY.

16:48.740 --> 16:50.105
GONNA GET YOU SOME HELP.

16:50.140 --> 16:52.563
I'M JUST GONNA GRAB
THIS PEPPERMINT PATTIE.

16:52.610 --> 16:54.475
I DIDN'T MEAN TO GIVE IT TO YOU.
- SHAWN.

16:58.810 --> 17:03.383
- UH, YOUR PLANE TICKETS
WERE PAID FOR BY?

17:03.420 --> 17:05.388
- DESPEREAUX.

17:05.420 --> 17:07.308
- AND YOUR ROOM?
- KIND OF A PACKAGE DEAL, ED.

17:07.360 --> 17:08.486
- YOUR CAR RENTAL?

17:08.520 --> 17:10.329
- HE PAID FOR THE RENTAL CAR?

17:10.360 --> 17:12.726
- WHAT PART OF ALL-INCLUSIVE
DO YOU NOT UNDERSTAND, GUS?

17:12.760 --> 17:14.455
YES, HE MAY HAVE PAID
FOR THAT TOO

17:14.500 --> 17:15.797
AND SOME WALKING AROUND MONEY.

17:15.830 --> 17:17.468
MAN HAS A LOT
OF DISPOSABLE INCOME.

17:17.500 --> 17:19.821
WHAT? IT'S NOT
LIKE WE'RE FRIENDS, GUS.

17:19.870 --> 17:23.362
- IT SAYS HERE YOU ALSO SENT HIM
A BIRTHDAY PRESENT.

17:23.410 --> 17:25.401
- YOU BOUGHT HIM A PRESENT?
- I HAD NO CHOICE.

17:25.440 --> 17:26.634
HE GOT ME THESE JEANS
LAST CHRISTMAS.

17:26.670 --> 17:28.774
- YOU FORGOT MY BIRTHDAY.
- OKAY, GUYS,

17:28.810 --> 17:30.607
I KNOW THIS LOOKS BAD.

17:30.650 --> 17:32.504
REALLY, REALLY BAD.

17:32.550 --> 17:34.108
LET'S NOT FORGET I AM THE ONE

17:34.150 --> 17:35.344
WHO CAUGHT THIS GUY
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

17:35.380 --> 17:36.540
- IT'S TRUE, ED. HE DID.

17:36.580 --> 17:38.309
- I CAME HERE TO TELL YOU
THAT DESPEREAUX WOULD ESCAPE,

17:38.350 --> 17:41.080
WHICH HE DID,
AND I WILL CATCH HIM AGAIN.

17:41.120 --> 17:42.314
I WILL ALSO TIE HIM
TO THE MURDER

17:42.360 --> 17:46.251
OF THAT CROWN PROSECUTOR GUY
IF HE IN FACT DID THAT AS WELL.

17:46.290 --> 17:48.451
NOW IF WE COULD STOP
INTERROGATING ONE ANOTHER

17:48.500 --> 17:50.764
AND START WORKING TOGETHER
AND LOVING ONE ANOTHER,

17:50.800 --> 17:52.791
WE CAN GET THIS DONE.

17:52.830 --> 17:53.762
LET'S GO BACK TO THE CRIME SCENE

17:53.800 --> 17:56.792
AND START OURSELVES
A REAL INVESTIGATION.

17:56.840 --> 17:58.137
- [sighs]

18:00.340 --> 18:03.173
- WHAT ARE WE DOING?

18:03.210 --> 18:05.144
- WE ARE LOOKING
FOR DISCREPANCIES.

18:05.180 --> 18:07.273
- ARE WE TRYING TO CONVICT
OR EXONERATE DESPEREAUX?

18:07.320 --> 18:09.515
- NO, GUS,
I HAVEN'T DECIDED YET.

18:30.170 --> 18:31.762
- YOU HAVE A TREMENDOUS EYE
FOR DETAIL, SHAWN.

18:31.810 --> 18:33.835
I HAD ONLY JUST HID.

18:33.880 --> 18:35.438
- DESPEREAUX,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

18:35.480 --> 18:36.777
- SAME THING
YOU'RE DOING HERE.

18:36.810 --> 18:38.209
TRYING TO PROVE ME INNOCENT.

18:38.250 --> 18:39.376
- YEAH, WELL, WE HAVEN'T DECIDED

18:39.410 --> 18:40.377
IF WE THINK YOU'RE INNOCENT.

18:40.420 --> 18:41.444
- I DID.
YOU'RE NOT.

18:41.480 --> 18:43.448
- YOU'RE MAKING THIS
VERY DIFFICULT.

18:43.490 --> 18:44.684
COMING BACK TO THE SCENE
OF THE CRIME?

18:44.720 --> 18:46.142
COME ON.
- YOU'RE TRYING TO COVER UP

18:46.190 --> 18:47.612
THE EVIDENCE.
- WELL, MY PLAN WAS

18:47.660 --> 18:49.810
TO DO THE JOB
AND THEN SNEAK BACK INTO PRISON.

18:49.860 --> 18:51.657
BUT WHEN YOU TOLD ME
ABOUT THE BODY

18:51.690 --> 18:54.250
AND THE FINGERPRINTS
AND THE CIGARETTE, WELL,

18:54.300 --> 18:56.188
I HAD TO BREAK OUT AGAIN.

18:56.230 --> 18:57.629
I HAD TO SEE WHAT THEY DID
TO SET ME UP.

18:57.670 --> 18:59.399
AND THEY DID A GOOD JOB.

18:59.430 --> 19:01.569
ALLOW ME TO CLEAR MYSELF.

19:01.600 --> 19:03.306
I'LL GO BACK.

19:03.340 --> 19:04.864
SCOUT'S HONOR.

19:04.910 --> 19:06.366
- OH. SCOUT'S HONOR.

19:06.410 --> 19:07.536
GOOD ENOUGH FOR ME.

19:07.580 --> 19:08.933
- NOT THIS TIME, DESPEREAUX.

19:08.980 --> 19:11.847
- WHAT OPTIONS DO WE HAVE,
SHAWN?

19:14.750 --> 19:18.538
- HE'S HERE!
DESPEREAUX IS HERE.

19:18.590 --> 19:19.818
HE IS IN THE CLOSET.

19:19.850 --> 19:22.182
FOLLOW ME, YOU MOUNTIES!

19:22.220 --> 19:24.359
- WELL, THIS IS UNCOMFORTABLE.

19:24.390 --> 19:25.482
- COME ON!

19:32.330 --> 19:34.935
- [groans]

19:34.970 --> 19:36.892
NICE, SHAWN.

19:36.940 --> 19:38.862
- MAYBE YOU GUYS
SHOULD JUST HEAD HOME.

19:38.910 --> 19:40.673
- I'M NOT CONVINCED
DESPEREAUX IS THE KILLER.

19:40.710 --> 19:42.678
WHY WOULD A GUILTY MAN
RISK COMING BACK?

19:42.710 --> 19:44.803
- WHY WOULD AN INNOCENT MAN
BLUDGEON ME LIKE A SPORT TUNA?

19:44.850 --> 19:46.499
- IT'S A TINY BUMP.

19:46.550 --> 19:48.347
- IF I HADN'T WAXED MY HEAD,
I'D BE DEAD RIGHT NOW.

19:50.890 --> 19:52.846
- HOW IS WAX A FACTOR?

19:52.890 --> 19:55.779
- SHAWN--
- PARDON ME.

19:55.820 --> 19:58.459
MRS.--MRS. SANTEE?

19:58.490 --> 20:00.697
- YES.
- HELLO, I'M SHAWN SPENCER,

20:00.730 --> 20:01.890
PSYCHIC DETECTIVE.

20:01.930 --> 20:03.659
THIS IS BIG APPLE MACKINTOSH

20:03.700 --> 20:05.964
AND MY PARTNER
YASMINE BLEETH.

20:06.000 --> 20:08.468
I AM SENSING
THAT THE SAFE WAS OPEN.

20:08.500 --> 20:09.330
IS THAT ACCURATE?

20:09.370 --> 20:10.860
- YES, I FOUND IT OPEN
WHEN I GOT HOME.

20:10.910 --> 20:12.969
- IF YOU DON'T MIND MY ASKING,

20:13.010 --> 20:15.672
WHAT KIND OF ART
WAS STORED IN THE SAFE?

20:15.710 --> 20:16.677
- NONE.

20:16.710 --> 20:18.871
JOHNNY BELIEVED
THAT ART WAS MEANT TO BE SEEN

20:18.910 --> 20:22.539
AND NEVER HIDDEN,
WHICH IS WHY THIS ALL HAPPENED.

20:22.580 --> 20:25.947
HE NEVER UNDERSTOOD THE THREATS
THAT DISPLAYING WEALTH POSED.

20:25.990 --> 20:27.719
- SO WHAT WAS IN THE SAFE?
MONEY? JEWELRY?

20:27.760 --> 20:30.479
- NO, THOSE THINGS
ARE IN A SAFETY DEPOSIT BOX.

20:30.530 --> 20:32.327
THIS WAS JUST WORK DOCUMENTS.

20:32.360 --> 20:34.920
- WHAT WAS MISSING
FROM THE SAFE?

20:34.960 --> 20:36.496
- NOTHING.

20:38.070 --> 20:39.867
- WE REALLY SHOULDN'T STAY HERE.

20:39.900 --> 20:41.492
- WHAT, IN OUR OWN ROOM?

20:41.540 --> 20:42.791
- WE'RE MAKING OURSELVES
ACCOMPLICES TO MURDER.

20:42.840 --> 20:44.034
- I'M SO TORN, GUS.

20:44.070 --> 20:45.628
DESPEREAUX ONLY STEALS ART.

20:45.670 --> 20:46.864
HE HAS A COMPELLING ARGUMENT.

20:46.910 --> 20:48.775
HE BUSTS OUT OF PRISON
TO DO ONE LAST JOB,

20:48.810 --> 20:50.368
SNEAKS BACK IN
BEFORE ANYONE NOTICES.

20:50.410 --> 20:51.547
HE'S BEING EXTRADITED TOMORROW,

20:51.580 --> 20:52.774
SO THAT'S PERFECT.

20:52.810 --> 20:53.970
JOB TURNS OUT TO BE A SET-UP.

20:54.020 --> 20:55.169
THEY USE IT TO KILL SOMEONE.

20:55.220 --> 20:57.780
DESPEREAUX FINDS OUT, OF COURSE,
HE NEEDS TO ESCAPE AGAIN.

20:57.820 --> 21:00.914
- THAT'S TOO MUCH, SHAWN.

21:00.960 --> 21:03.849
- I KNEW YOU'D COME THROUGH,
SHAWN.

21:03.890 --> 21:07.599
SO WHAT MADE YOU CHANGE
YOUR MIND ABOUT MY INNOCENCE?

21:07.630 --> 21:08.858
- HIS MIND ISN'T CHANGED.

21:08.900 --> 21:10.049
- WELL...

21:10.100 --> 21:12.660
- AH, THERE YOU ARE.

21:14.040 --> 21:18.909
DARLING, THIS IS THEM.

21:20.740 --> 21:23.971
- THANK YOU FOR HELPING HIM.

21:24.010 --> 21:25.409
- YOU MET A GIRL.

21:25.450 --> 21:26.474
ON THE RUN?

21:26.510 --> 21:27.841
- OH, DON'T BE RIDICULOUS.

21:27.880 --> 21:28.949
I MET HER IN PRISON.

21:36.020 --> 21:37.556
- DON'T GO BACK.

21:37.590 --> 21:39.581
- I WOULDN'T DREAM OF IT.

21:41.860 --> 21:45.318
- I REALLY SHOULD GO.

21:48.900 --> 21:50.538
- [clears throat]

21:50.570 --> 21:53.107
- DO YOU ENGLISH EVEN KNOW
THE SOCK ON THE DOOR RULE?

21:53.140 --> 21:54.937
AND WHAT EXACTLY WENT ON
IN HERE?

21:54.980 --> 21:57.801
MORE IMPORTANTLY, DO I NEED TO
GET A NEW ROOM AND/OR SHEETS?

21:57.850 --> 21:58.839
- RELAX, GENTLEMEN.

21:58.880 --> 22:03.908
I THINK I HAVE A SOLUTION
TO ALL OUR PROBLEMS.

22:03.950 --> 22:06.544
I WANT TO HIRE YOU...

22:06.590 --> 22:08.478
TO PROVE MY INNOCENCE.

22:08.520 --> 22:10.954
- YOU CAN'T HIRE US.
WE'RE TRYING TO CAPTURE YOU.

22:10.990 --> 22:12.582
- OH, FAIR ENOUGH.

22:12.630 --> 22:13.949
YOU CAN CONTINUE
TO TRY TO CAPTURE ME,

22:14.000 --> 22:15.991
BLAH, BLAH, BLAH,
BUT I ALSO WANT YOU TO PROVE

22:16.030 --> 22:18.828
THAT I'M NOT A MURDERER.
[knock at door]

22:18.870 --> 22:21.737
- SHE MUST HAVE FORGOT
HER TONGUE.

22:23.570 --> 22:25.902
- HEY.
- HEY.

22:25.940 --> 22:27.703
- CAN I COME IN?

22:27.740 --> 22:28.809
- WHY?

22:28.840 --> 22:33.004
- WHY? YOU KIND OF MADE
A BIG DEAL ABOUT US TALKING.

22:33.050 --> 22:34.677
- DID I?
HUH.

22:34.720 --> 22:36.813
- COME ON. I REALLY NEED
TO TALK TO YOU TOO.

22:36.850 --> 22:38.909
I CAME BY LIKE 20 MINUTES AGO,
BUT I HEARD VOICES.

22:38.950 --> 22:41.817
I WASN'T SURE
IF I HAD THE RIGHT ROOM.

22:41.860 --> 22:44.420
DO YOU HAVE A GIRL IN THERE?

22:44.460 --> 22:45.950
- WHAT?
NO.

22:45.990 --> 22:47.150
NO, NOT IN ME.

22:47.190 --> 22:48.452
IN HERE.

22:48.500 --> 22:49.853
NO ONE'S IN HERE.
THERE'S NO--

22:49.900 --> 22:51.993
I'M JUST--I'M ALONE
IN HERE LIKE A WOLF.

22:52.030 --> 22:54.863
- OKAY, THEN WHY
CAN'T I COME IN?

22:54.900 --> 22:57.960
- BECAUSE I CAN'T DO THIS
WITH YOU RIGHT NOW.

22:58.010 --> 23:00.103
- YOU SAID IT WAS IMPORTANT.
- I LIED.

23:00.140 --> 23:01.835
OKAY? I LIE.
I DO THINGS LIKE THAT.

23:01.880 --> 23:03.871
- OH, COME ON, SHAWN,
I AM AT A LOSS.

23:03.910 --> 23:05.104
YOU WANT TO TALK.
YOU DON'T WANT TO TALK.

23:05.150 --> 23:07.618
LOOK, IF YOU CAN'T SAY
WHAT'S ON YOUR MIND,

23:07.650 --> 23:10.619
THEN I WILL SAY
WHAT'S ON MINE.

23:10.650 --> 23:14.017
I BROKE UP WITH DECLAN.

23:14.060 --> 23:16.915
- WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT?

23:16.960 --> 23:20.418
I MEAN, I JUST CAN'T DO THIS
RIGHT NOW.

23:20.460 --> 23:23.156
ANYTIME LATER, YOU NAME IT.
WE CAN SCHEDULE IT.

23:23.200 --> 23:24.792
- DON'T BOTHER.

23:24.830 --> 23:27.958
- JULES.

23:29.470 --> 23:30.835
- GIRL TROUBLE?

23:30.870 --> 23:32.701
IS THERE ANYTHING
I CAN HELP YOU WITH?

23:32.740 --> 23:34.173
- NO.
YOU KNOW WHAT, I THINK

23:34.210 --> 23:36.428
YOU'VE BEEN MORE
THAN ENOUGH HELP ALREADY.

23:36.480 --> 23:38.038
WILL YOU JUST BE STRAIGHT
WITH US FOR ONCE?

23:38.080 --> 23:40.071
- I WILL BE UTTERLY TRANSPARENT.

23:40.110 --> 23:42.613
- WHO HIRED YOU FOR THE JOB?
- I DON'T KNOW.

23:42.650 --> 23:44.618
- WELL, NOW WE'RE GETTING
SOMEWHERE.

23:44.650 --> 23:46.811
- THE JOB WAS BROUGHT TO ME
IN PRISON BY MARTY SEWELL.

23:46.850 --> 23:47.953
HE'S A MATCHMAKER.

23:47.990 --> 23:49.480
- THAT'S WHERE YOU FOUND
THE GIRL?

23:49.520 --> 23:51.886
- NO, NO, NO, MATCHMAKER
AS IN MIDDLE MAN.

23:51.930 --> 23:54.899
HE PUTS A CLIENT
AND A CRIMINAL TOGETHER.

23:54.930 --> 23:57.467
HE OFFERED ME THE JOB IN PRISON

23:57.500 --> 23:59.593
AND TOLD ME THAT IT HAD
TO HAPPEN INSTANTLY.

23:59.630 --> 24:01.666
- FINE.
WHERE DO WE FIND HIM?

24:04.740 --> 24:06.935
- MARTIN FINDS YOU.

24:06.970 --> 24:08.972
YOU DON'T FIND HIM.

24:10.210 --> 24:14.977
THAT IS, OF COURSE,
UNLESS YOU'RE A PSYCHIC.

24:15.020 --> 24:17.887
- YOU GIVE ME TWO HOURS.

24:17.920 --> 24:20.650
- AND DON'T HAVE SEX
IN OUR BEDS.

24:20.690 --> 24:22.578
- [chuckles]

24:26.730 --> 24:29.221
- I CAN ONLY ASK WHY.
WHY DO YOU GUYS HATE ME SO MUCH?

24:29.260 --> 24:30.966
- MACKINTOSH,
WE DON'T HATE YOU.

24:31.000 --> 24:31.967
WE WANT TO HELP YOU.

24:32.000 --> 24:33.865
- BY LETTING YOU HELP US.

24:33.900 --> 24:34.992
- WE CAN'T GET THIS COMPUTER
TO WORK.

24:35.040 --> 24:36.564
- I TOLD YOU HIS PASSWORD

24:36.600 --> 24:37.828
WASN'T SENOR WHOPPERPANTS.

24:37.870 --> 24:39.508
- IT WAS WORTH A SHOT, GUS.

24:39.540 --> 24:41.531
- THIS IS DETECTIVE BREITLING'S
COMPUTER.

24:41.580 --> 24:43.605
THE POOR GUY JUST DIED.

24:43.650 --> 24:45.948
YOU SHOULDN'T BE USING IT.
THERE'S A MOURNING PERIOD.

24:45.980 --> 24:46.878
- NOT FOR ELECTRONICS.

24:46.910 --> 24:48.275
- YEAH, LIKE,
IF IT WAS HIS COFFEE MUG,

24:48.320 --> 24:49.344
THEN WE WOULDN'T USE IT.

24:49.380 --> 24:52.816
- CAN YOU GET US AN ADDRESS
FOR A MARTIN SEWELL?

24:52.850 --> 24:55.956
- NO. NO. I CANNOT DO ANYTHING
MORE FOR YOU GUYS.

24:55.990 --> 24:59.721
- WHAT IF I TOLD YOU HE WAS THE
ONE BEHIND THE SANTEE ROBBERY?

24:59.760 --> 25:03.764
- HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT?

25:03.800 --> 25:06.018
- OH.
- YEAH.

25:06.070 --> 25:07.867
- AND THEN YOU WILL LEAVE?

25:09.870 --> 25:11.201
- THANK YOU, SHAWN.

25:11.240 --> 25:13.572
WOULD HAVE TAKEN ME WEEKS
TO FIND SEWELL.

25:13.610 --> 25:17.102
NOW LET ME DO THE TALKING.
[knock at door]

25:20.950 --> 25:23.009
- HELLO, MARTY.
SURPRISED TO SEE ME?

25:23.050 --> 25:25.245
EXCUSE ME, GENTLEMEN.

25:25.290 --> 25:27.679
- UM.

25:27.720 --> 25:29.915
[screaming]

25:29.960 --> 25:32.019
- DO YOU HEAR SCREAMING?

25:32.060 --> 25:35.723
- NO. NO, COME ON, DESPEREAUX'S
THE CONSUMMATE GENTLEMAN.

25:36.800 --> 25:38.267
HE'S GONNA KILL THAT GUY.

25:38.300 --> 25:40.894
WHOA!

25:40.940 --> 25:43.761
DESPEREAUX, LET HIM GO.

25:43.810 --> 25:45.061
- THAT'S THE PLAN.

25:45.110 --> 25:47.578
IF HE DOESN'T TELL ME
WHO HIRED HIM FOR THE JOB.

25:48.940 --> 25:50.840
WHO HIRED YOU?

25:50.880 --> 25:54.270
COME ON.

25:54.320 --> 25:56.140
TELL ME WHAT I NEED
TO KNOW, MARTY.

25:56.180 --> 25:57.943
I CAN'T HOLD ON MUCH LONGER.

25:57.990 --> 26:01.312
- IT WAS--
IT WAS CROSSLEY!

26:01.360 --> 26:03.316
- OOPS.

26:03.360 --> 26:05.021
- WHAT THE HELL
DOES OOPS MEAN?

26:05.060 --> 26:09.099
- UM, HE WAS SOMEWHAT
OF A BIG CRIME LORD UP HERE.

26:09.130 --> 26:11.189
I WAS IN PRISON
WITH HIM FOR A WHILE.

26:11.230 --> 26:14.290
I WAS KIND OF HAVING
AN AFFAIR WITH HIS WIFE.

26:14.340 --> 26:16.069
YOU MET HER AT THE HOTEL.

26:16.100 --> 26:18.307
- WILL YOU PUT THAT GUY DOWN?

26:18.340 --> 26:21.036
- OH, YES, ALMOST FORGOT.
COME ON.

26:23.910 --> 26:25.070
- [sighs]
- YOU KILLED HIM.

26:25.110 --> 26:28.147
- HE'LL BE FINE.
HE'S JUST IN SHOCK.

26:28.180 --> 26:30.068
IT'S ACTUALLY QUITE CLEANSING
ONCE YOU COME TO.

26:30.120 --> 26:32.179
- YOU'VE BEEN DANGLED
OFF A BUILDING BEFORE?

26:32.220 --> 26:34.211
- WELL, I'VE BEEN
THE DANGLER.

26:34.260 --> 26:35.818
IT'S ENORMOUSLY EFFECTIVE.

26:35.860 --> 26:38.021
TERRIBLE ON THE WRISTS.
TERRIBLE.

26:38.060 --> 26:39.755
- DESPEREAUX, WE HAVE
SOME SERIOUS QUESTIONS FOR YOU.

26:39.790 --> 26:41.758
- FIRE AWAY.

26:41.800 --> 26:43.358
- EXACTLY HOW DO YOU PICK UP
WOMEN IN PRISON?

26:43.400 --> 26:46.028
- OH,
VALERIA WAS VISITING FRANK

26:46.070 --> 26:47.264
AT AN ADJOINING TABLE.

26:47.300 --> 26:49.393
AND OUR EYES JUST MET.

26:49.440 --> 26:50.930
YOU KNOW
HOW THESE THINGS HAPPEN.

26:50.970 --> 26:52.164
- WHAT ABOUT CROSSLEY?

26:52.210 --> 26:55.839
- FRANK CROSSLEY
WAS THE MOST FEARED MAN

26:55.880 --> 26:57.108
IN OUR PRISON.

26:57.140 --> 26:59.973
HE MANAGED TO RUN
HIS WHOLE EMPIRE FROM INSIDE

27:00.010 --> 27:01.238
WITHOUT MISSING A BEAT.

27:01.280 --> 27:02.770
HE EVEN HAD A MAN KILLED

27:02.820 --> 27:03.844
IN TORONTO
IN AN HOUR.

27:03.890 --> 27:05.778
FROM THE EXERCISE ROOM.

27:05.820 --> 27:06.912
EXTRAORDINARY.

27:06.950 --> 27:11.228
[sirens wailing]

27:13.190 --> 27:14.396
- OH, DEAR.

27:14.430 --> 27:16.796
COME ON.

27:20.430 --> 27:21.988
- PIERRE,
THEY HAVE US SURROUNDED.

27:22.040 --> 27:23.769
YOU GOT TO TRUST ME.
GIVE YOURSELF UP.

27:23.810 --> 27:25.129
I WILL SOLVE THIS CASE
FOR YOU.

27:25.170 --> 27:27.035
BUT THERE'S NO WAY
THAT WE'RE GETTING OUT OF HERE.

27:27.070 --> 27:28.276
- ABOUT THAT.

27:28.310 --> 27:32.303
HAVE YOU EVER SEEN
THOSE BATMAN MOVIES?

27:36.420 --> 27:37.409
[gunshot]

27:47.360 --> 27:52.366
- WHERE DOES HE GET THOSE
WONDERFUL TOYS?

27:57.910 --> 28:00.003
- SO YOU JUST HAPPENED
TO BUMP INTO DESPEREAUX?

28:00.040 --> 28:01.769
- I WAS FOLLOWING
A VIBRATION.

28:01.810 --> 28:04.745
- SPENCER, GUSTER,
I CANNOT HELP YOU ANYMORE.

28:04.780 --> 28:06.179
- WAIT,
YOU'VE HELPED US BEFORE?

28:06.210 --> 28:07.142
- I SWEAR,
I AM GONNA LEAVE YOU

28:07.180 --> 28:09.375
TO ROT IN THIS BACKWARD,

28:09.420 --> 28:12.139
RAIN-DRENCHED DEN
OF POLITENESS.

28:12.190 --> 28:14.158
NO OFFENSE.
- NONE TAKEN.

28:14.190 --> 28:15.885
I LIKE YOUR SUIT.

28:15.920 --> 28:17.888
- WHERE'S JULIET?
- SHE DIDN'T WANT TO COME.

28:17.930 --> 28:19.124
- DO WE KNOW WHY?

28:19.160 --> 28:21.196
- I IMAGINE
IT WAS FEMALE TROUBLE,

28:21.230 --> 28:23.289
AND I DON'T CARE.
NOW GIVE UP DESPEREAUX,

28:23.330 --> 28:25.867
STOP MESSING AROUND, AND LET ME
TAKE HIM BACK TO MEET HIS MAKER.

28:25.900 --> 28:27.765
- I'M SORRY, DETECTIVE.
YOU'RE GONNA KILL HIM?

28:27.800 --> 28:32.134
- NO. IT'S A TERM
FOR BRING HIM TO JUSTICE.

28:32.170 --> 28:34.900
- THE TERM LITERALLY
IS "BRING HIM TO JUSTICE."

28:34.940 --> 28:36.168
"MEET YOUR MAKER"
I THINK MEANS MURDER.

28:36.210 --> 28:37.302
- THIS IS ABOUT ME NOW?

28:37.340 --> 28:39.399
HE'S THE ONE TRAIPSING
AROUND TOWN WITH YOUR SUSPECT.

28:39.450 --> 28:41.771
- [sneezes]

28:41.820 --> 28:43.981
I'M HAVING A VISION.

28:44.020 --> 28:46.739
- IT WAS--
IT WAS CROSSLEY.

28:46.790 --> 28:48.382
- MANAGED TO RUN
HIS WHOLE EMPIRE

28:48.420 --> 28:50.149
FROM INSIDE
WITHOUT MISSING A BEAT.

28:50.190 --> 28:52.181
- SPENCER.
- IT'S A MAN, A BAD MAN,

28:52.230 --> 28:53.925
A MURDERER.
HE AUTHORED A MURDER.

28:53.960 --> 28:56.190
HE RUNS HIS CRIME BUSINESS
FROM BEHIND BARS.

28:56.230 --> 29:01.896
HIS NAME IS FRANK--
FRANK CROSSLEY!

29:01.940 --> 29:03.032
- ALL RIGHT,
THIS MEETING'S OVER.

29:03.070 --> 29:04.332
I WANT YOU IN MY OFFICE.

29:04.370 --> 29:05.337
AND NOT YOU
AND NOT YOU.

29:05.370 --> 29:07.509
COME ON.
BRING HIM IN.

29:10.340 --> 29:12.274
- NOW WHAT THE HELL
ARE WE SUPPOSED TO DO?

29:12.310 --> 29:15.074
ALL RIGHT, ENOUGH OF THE GAMES.

29:15.120 --> 29:17.111
WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT
DETECTIVE BREITLING'S MURDER?

29:17.150 --> 29:19.516
- DETECTIVE BREITLING?

29:19.550 --> 29:21.256
THE ONE WHO JUST DIED
AT THE FISHING CABIN

29:21.290 --> 29:24.157
WITH THE STICKY KEYBOARD?
- DON'T PLAY COY WITH ME, BOY.

29:24.190 --> 29:25.987
YOU KNOW
THAT CLEARLY WE BELIEVE

29:26.030 --> 29:27.122
FRANK CROSSLEY
KILLED BREITLING.

29:27.160 --> 29:29.196
- WOW, I WAS REALLY MOVING
IN A DIFFERENT DIRECTION.

29:31.270 --> 29:33.329
- WE FOUND THIS.

29:33.370 --> 29:36.999
IT WAS HIDDEN
IN DETECTIVE BREITLING'S HOUSE.

29:37.040 --> 29:38.860
- THIS IS A SERIES OF DATES
THAT ALL CONTRADICT EACH OTHER.

29:38.910 --> 29:40.832
HUH.

29:40.880 --> 29:43.235
THIS WOULD SEEMINGLY INDICATE
THAT CROSSLEY'S INNOCENT.

29:43.280 --> 29:45.168
- SHAWN, YOU'VE GOT TO STOP
HIDING THINGS FROM US.

29:45.210 --> 29:47.371
THIS IS VERY SERIOUS.

29:47.410 --> 29:48.946
HOW CLOSE WAS BREITLING GETTING

29:48.980 --> 29:50.174
TO BRINGING DOWN
CROSSLEY'S ORGANIZATION?

29:50.220 --> 29:51.244
- DO YOU KNOW
WHAT HE FOUND?

29:51.290 --> 29:52.939
- HE FOUND SOMETHING?

29:52.990 --> 29:54.582
- HE TOLD HIS WIFE TO GO AND
SPEND THE NIGHT WITH HER SISTER.

29:54.620 --> 29:56.019
THE NEXT THING YOU KNOW,
HE TURNS UP DEAD.

29:56.060 --> 29:59.029
YOU'VE GOT TO TELL US
WHAT HE FOUND.

29:59.060 --> 30:01.153
- NO, THOSE THINGS
ARE IN A SAFETY DEPOSIT BOX.

30:01.200 --> 30:02.497
THIS WAS JUST WORK DOCUMENTS.

30:06.330 --> 30:08.332
- CAN WE GO BACK
TO BREITLING'S DESK?

30:09.440 --> 30:11.408
DID BREITLING KNOW
THE CROWN PROSECUTOR?

30:11.440 --> 30:13.101
- WE ALL KNOW
THE CROWN PROSECUTOR.

30:13.140 --> 30:14.175
- DID HE TALK TO HIM?

30:14.210 --> 30:16.269
- NOT RECENTLY ACCORDING
TO HIS CELL PHONE RECORDS.

30:16.310 --> 30:17.948
- NO, HE PROBABLY WOULDN'T.

30:17.980 --> 30:20.847
IT'S NOT SAFE.

30:33.360 --> 30:36.295
DID HE HAVE ANY
OTHER CORRESPONDENCE WITH HIM?

30:36.330 --> 30:38.491
- I COULD HAVE
SOMEBODY RUN THAT.

30:38.530 --> 30:39.622
- I'LL RUN IT.
- NO.

30:39.670 --> 30:41.035
YOU RUN IT, MACKINTOSH,

30:41.070 --> 30:42.389
AND TAKE ALL THE CREDIT
WHEN IT COMES IN.

30:42.440 --> 30:44.169
WHERE'S CROSSLEY NOW?

30:44.210 --> 30:45.609
- WE HAVE A SURVEILLANCE TEAM

30:45.640 --> 30:47.062
WATCHING HIM AT HIS HOUSE.
WHY?

30:47.110 --> 30:49.305
- 'CAUSE WE'RE ABOUT TO MAKE
AN ARREST.

30:49.340 --> 30:51.399
FOR TWO MURDERS.

30:51.450 --> 30:53.941
GUS.

30:57.550 --> 30:59.541
- JUST CAN'T GO IN THERE
ON A HUNCH.

30:59.590 --> 31:01.353
- BRACE YOURSELF, ED.

31:01.390 --> 31:03.210
I'M ABOUT TO BLOW
YOUR BRILLIANT MIND.

31:03.260 --> 31:05.125
YOUR DETECTIVE BREITLING

31:05.160 --> 31:06.354
WAS ON THE VERGE
OF BRINGING DOWN

31:06.390 --> 31:07.926
FRANK CROSSLEY'S EMPIRE.

31:07.960 --> 31:09.393
WORKING
HIS OWN PRIVATE SURVEILLANCE,

31:09.430 --> 31:11.159
HE RECORDED AND PHOTOGRAPHED

31:11.200 --> 31:13.168
SOMETHING
THAT CHANGED EVERYTHING,

31:13.200 --> 31:14.633
SOMETHING BIG.

31:14.670 --> 31:16.888
BIGGER THAN THE CHARGES
THAT PUT CROSSLEY

31:16.940 --> 31:19.158
IN A MINIMUM SECURITY PRISON
FOR A FEW MONTHS THIS YEAR.

31:19.210 --> 31:22.236
OOH.
- NO, THOSE WERE A GIFT.

31:22.280 --> 31:24.339
- YOU'LL GET THEM BACK
WHEN I'M FINISHED.

31:24.380 --> 31:27.372
YES. I CAN SEE IT ALL NOW.

31:27.410 --> 31:29.241
DANGEROUS INFORMATION.

31:29.280 --> 31:32.215
SO HUGE HE THOUGHT
IT COULD BE THE END OF HIM.

31:32.250 --> 31:33.478
SO JUST IN CASE
SOMETHING TERRIBLE

31:33.520 --> 31:35.283
AND UNEXPECTED HAPPENED,

31:35.320 --> 31:37.015
HE SENT A COPY
TO THE CROWN PROSECUTOR,

31:37.060 --> 31:38.982
FEARFUL HE WAS BEING WATCHED.

31:39.030 --> 31:40.327
WELL, GUESS WHAT?

31:40.360 --> 31:43.124
SOMETHING TERRIBLE DID HAPPEN

31:43.160 --> 31:44.320
TO BOTH OF THEM.

31:44.370 --> 31:45.564
ONE WAS SET UP
TO LOOK LIKE AN ACCIDENT

31:45.600 --> 31:47.363
AT BREITLING'S FISHING CABIN.

31:47.400 --> 31:51.166
THE OTHER, AN ART THEFT.
TWO DEATHS, SEEMINGLY...

31:51.210 --> 31:55.203
- [gaSPSJ
- UNCONNECTED.

31:55.240 --> 31:57.231
A DETECTIVE AND A PROSECUTOR.

31:57.280 --> 32:02.047
TWO MEN AT EITHER END
OF THE DANGEROUS INFORMATION

32:02.080 --> 32:05.243
THAT WOULD BRING DOWN
A HIGH-POWERED CRIME BOSS.

32:05.290 --> 32:07.246
- PLEASE, SHAWN,
GIVE THOSE BACK.

32:07.290 --> 32:09.110
- I'M NOT QUITE FINISHED,
MACKINTOSH.

32:09.160 --> 32:10.980
- THEY'RE EXPENSIVE.
THOSE ARE FROM HOLLAND.

32:11.030 --> 32:12.156
- I NEED TO BUTTON THIS THING
AND BRING IT HOME.

32:12.190 --> 32:13.452
- SHAWN, I'M NOT KIDDING AROUND.

32:13.490 --> 32:15.299
- RELAX, DUDE.
- AT LEAST PUT ON THE STRAP.

32:15.330 --> 32:16.456
- RELAX.
- GIVE ME THE BINOCULARS.

32:16.500 --> 32:17.524
- I'M NOT GIVING YOU
THE BINOCULARS.

32:17.560 --> 32:19.164
- WELL, AT LEAST PUT
THE STRAP ON.

32:19.200 --> 32:21.634
- CROSSLEY SET UP THE GUY
WHO WAS BANGING HIS WIFE,

32:21.670 --> 32:23.433
PIERRE DESPEREAUX.

32:23.470 --> 32:25.028
- IS THIS HOW THEY DO THINGS
IN THE STATES?

32:25.070 --> 32:27.265
- NO, NO, USUALLY
IT'S MUCH LESS PROFESSIONAL.

32:27.310 --> 32:28.629
- HE PLANTED
DESPEREAUX'S FINGERPRINTS

32:28.680 --> 32:30.136
AND HIS SIGNATURE CIGARETTE.

32:30.180 --> 32:31.647
- AND, UNFORTUNATELY,
HE'S RIGHT.

32:31.680 --> 32:33.272
A COURIER DID HAND-DELIVER
A PACKAGE

32:33.310 --> 32:35.619
TO THE CROWN PROSECUTOR
SIX DAYS BEFORE HIS DEATH.

32:35.650 --> 32:37.015
IT WAS PICKED UP FROM A MAN
WITH A BADGE

32:37.050 --> 32:40.281
MATCHING
BREITLING'S DESCRIPTION.

32:40.320 --> 32:43.312
- GOOD, WE HAVE ENOUGH TO GO
INTO CROSSLEY'S HOUSE.

32:43.360 --> 32:45.248
MACKINTOSH.

32:55.400 --> 32:58.631
- LET ME GUESS.
FRANK CROSSLEY?

32:58.670 --> 33:00.661
- [sighs]

33:13.050 --> 33:14.449
- OKAY, NOW I ADMIT IT.
HE LOOKS GUILTY.

33:14.490 --> 33:16.082
- HOW MANY MORE PEOPLE
ARE YOU GONNA LET HIM KILL?

33:16.120 --> 33:19.328
- I DON'T KNOW, GUS.
MAYBE ONE MORE. TOPS.

33:19.360 --> 33:21.191
- WE ARE NOW ACCESSORIES
TO TWO MURDERS,

33:21.230 --> 33:22.629
TWO PRISON ESCAPES,
AND HELPING HIM

33:22.660 --> 33:23.627
DANGLE A GUY OFF A BUILDING.

33:23.660 --> 33:25.196
- THERE'S NO WAY DANGLING A GUY
OFF THE BUILDING

33:25.230 --> 33:27.118
IS IN THE CRIMINAL CODE,
NOT IN CANADA.

33:27.170 --> 33:28.262
WOULD YOU HURRY UP?

33:28.300 --> 33:30.291
THERE'S NO WAY
HE GOT VERY FAR ON FOOT.

33:32.110 --> 33:34.578
- HE'S IN THE CAR, ISN'T HE?

33:42.820 --> 33:44.685
- NOPE.

33:44.720 --> 33:45.789
DUDE, THE GAS TANK?
REALLY?

33:45.820 --> 33:47.549
- NO STONE UNTURNED, SHAWN.

33:47.590 --> 33:50.650
- WELL, YOU SHOULD PROBABLY
CHECK UNDER THAT STONE.

33:50.690 --> 33:52.487
OH, OH, DO NOT TAKE
ANOTHER STEP, DESPEREAUX.

33:52.530 --> 33:54.191
WE ARE NOT GONNA HELP YOU ESCAPE
THIS TIME.

33:54.230 --> 33:56.698
- I'M AFRAID
THAT WON'T BE NECESSARY.

33:56.730 --> 33:57.754
- IN THE CAR.

33:57.800 --> 33:59.392
- I CAME
TO STRAIGHTEN THINGS OUT

33:59.430 --> 34:00.727
WITH FRANK,
AND I FOUND HIM DEAD

34:00.770 --> 34:03.489
WITH VALERIA SETTING UP
A CRIME SCENE,

34:03.540 --> 34:07.135
PLACING ONE OF MY SIGNATURE
CIGARETTES NEAR THE BODY.

34:07.170 --> 34:09.206
IT'S THE SECOND TIME
SHE'S TRIED THAT, ISN'T IT?

34:09.240 --> 34:11.105
- SO YOU'RE THE CRIME BOSS.

34:11.150 --> 34:13.573
- YES, I FEEL
RATHER FOOLISH NOW.

34:13.610 --> 34:16.272
- ARE WE GONNA GET MOVING,
OR DO I NEED TO START SHOOTING?

34:16.320 --> 34:18.515
- HE MANAGED TO RUN
HIS WHOLE EMPIRE

34:18.550 --> 34:20.211
FROM INSIDE
WITHOUT MISSING A BEAT.

34:20.250 --> 34:21.114
- THAT'S HOW FRANK CROSSLEY

34:21.160 --> 34:23.082
COULD RUN HIS EMPIRE
FROM BEHIND BARS.

34:23.120 --> 34:26.658
HE DIDN'T.
IT WAS ALL A FRONT FOR YOU.

34:26.690 --> 34:28.328
THAT WAS THE GAME-CHANGING
INFORMATION

34:28.360 --> 34:30.225
THAT BREITLING HAD ON CROSSLEY.

34:30.260 --> 34:32.763
JUST NOT FRANK CROSSLEY.

34:32.800 --> 34:35.337
VALERIA CROSSLEY.

34:35.370 --> 34:37.361
YOU WERE THE ONE
WHO WAS ON TO BREITLING.

34:39.140 --> 34:40.300
- GET IN THE [...] HOUSE!

34:40.340 --> 34:42.501
- AND WITH THE CROWN PROSECUTOR
INVOLVED,

34:42.540 --> 34:44.303
YOU HAD TO KILL THEM BOTH.

34:44.350 --> 34:45.544
YOU HAD THE PERFECT PATSY.

34:45.580 --> 34:47.605
YOU KNEW HE COULD BREAK INTO
ANYTHING BECAUSE HE'S AWESOME.

34:47.650 --> 34:50.517
AND AS A NICE BONUS,
HE WAS ALSO LOOKING FOR LOVE.

34:50.550 --> 34:54.657
- WELL, I WOULDN'T SAY
SEARCHING FOR LOVE, PER SE.

34:54.690 --> 34:56.555
IT STARTED OUT KIND OF,
I DON'T KNOW, ANIMAL REALLY.

34:56.590 --> 34:58.387
- DESPEREAUX, LET ME FINISH.

34:58.430 --> 34:59.180
- RIGHT.

34:59.230 --> 35:00.629
- IN THE MIDST
OF ALL THIS MESS,

35:00.660 --> 35:02.628
YOUR POOR, UNFORTUNATE HUSBAND

35:02.660 --> 35:04.491
HAD TO END THE TRAIL.

35:04.530 --> 35:09.365
HE WAS THE FINAL LOOSE END.

35:09.400 --> 35:11.732
AND YOU STILL HAD THE PERFECT
PATSY RUNNING AROUND.

35:14.480 --> 35:15.833
- DON'T GO BACK.

35:17.240 --> 35:21.347
I MEAN THAT AS A COMPLIMENT.
- THANK YOU.

35:21.380 --> 35:23.541
[gunshot]

35:39.300 --> 35:41.268
- I WAS THE PAWN.

35:41.300 --> 35:43.188
I CAN'T BE THE PAWN.

35:43.240 --> 35:45.708
I REALLY LIKED HER.

35:45.740 --> 35:48.436
MAYBE I-I WAS LOOKING
FOR LOVE.

35:48.480 --> 35:49.708
- MAYBE YOU NEED
TO TAKE A CHANCE,

35:49.740 --> 35:51.276
PUT YOUR HEART ON THE LINE.

35:51.310 --> 35:52.470
OFTENTIMES,
THEY TURN OUT

35:52.510 --> 35:54.717
TO BE COLD-BLOODED MURDERERS,
BUT SOMETIMES THEY DON'T.

35:54.750 --> 35:57.412
ANY RELATIONSHIP'S GONNA BE
A LEAP OF FAITH.

35:57.450 --> 35:59.247
IT TOOK ME FOUR YEARS
TO FIGURE THAT OUT.

35:59.290 --> 36:00.416
- COULD YOU KEEP
YOUR VOICE DOWN?

36:00.450 --> 36:01.917
- HONEY?

36:01.960 --> 36:04.485
YOU KNOW
I DON'T LIKE LOOSE ENDS.

36:10.460 --> 36:15.238
I DON'T WANT TO HAVE
TO DO THIS HERE.

36:15.270 --> 36:17.431
YOU KNOW, MAYBE WE COULD BE
USEFUL TO EACH OTHER.

36:17.470 --> 36:18.698
HUH?

36:18.740 --> 36:22.437
YOU...
ME...

36:22.480 --> 36:25.779
- OKAY.
I'M GOING OUT.

36:25.810 --> 36:28.472
WHEN I GET OUT THERE,
YOU TWO MAKE FOR THE DOOR.

36:28.520 --> 36:29.976
ALL RIGHT?
- SHE'LL KILL YOU.

36:30.020 --> 36:31.908
- NO, NO, NO, SHE'LL KILL YOU.
SHE WON'T KILL ME.

36:31.950 --> 36:34.350
YOU SEE, SHAWN,
YOU WERE RIGHT.

36:34.390 --> 36:36.255
IT IS A LEAP OF FAITH.

36:36.290 --> 36:38.884
AND I HAVE FAITH
SHE WON'T KILL ME.

36:38.930 --> 36:40.488
- I WAS WRONG.
DON'T TAKE THE CHANCE.

36:40.530 --> 36:41.497
- TAKE THE CHANCE.
TAKE IT NOW.

36:41.530 --> 36:43.498
- DON'T TAKE THE CHANCE.
I HAVE A BETTER IDEA.

36:43.530 --> 36:44.690
- S0 DO I.
- YOU HAVE ZERO IDEAS.

36:44.730 --> 36:45.890
- I'LL GET THE DOOR FOR HIM.

36:45.930 --> 36:47.568
- ALL RIGHT,
ON THE COUNT OF THREE.

36:47.600 --> 36:50.330
ONE, TWO, THREE.

36:52.670 --> 36:55.707
DARLING.

36:55.740 --> 36:57.503
SWEETH EART.

36:57.540 --> 36:58.939
THERE ARE TOO MANY MOVING PARTS.

36:58.980 --> 37:01.312
YOU CAN'T STOP THEM ALL.

37:02.650 --> 37:04.015
LOOK, I HAVE YOU.

37:04.050 --> 37:05.688
YOU HAVE ME.

37:05.720 --> 37:07.483
JUST LET ME HAVE THE GUN.

37:07.520 --> 37:09.511
[gunshot]

37:13.060 --> 37:15.995
YOU ALL RIGHT?

37:16.030 --> 37:19.488
- SEE. I TOLD YOU
SHE WOULDN'T KILL ME.

37:19.530 --> 37:21.737
- YEAH. TRUE LOVE.

37:21.770 --> 37:23.590
GUS!

37:23.640 --> 37:24.937
WE'RE GOOD.

37:29.410 --> 37:30.707
STOP RUNNING.

37:34.920 --> 37:36.649
- I DON'T KNOW
WHY YOU'RE SMILING.

37:36.680 --> 37:38.409
THE CHARGES IN THE STATES
ARE EVERY BIT AS STEEP

37:38.450 --> 37:40.418
AS THE ONES HERE.

37:40.450 --> 37:43.317
- I FIND YOUR CONFIDENCE
IN THE AMERICAN JUSTICE SYSTEM

37:43.360 --> 37:45.555
ADORABLE.

37:45.590 --> 37:47.387
THEY'LL NEVER CONVICT ME.

37:47.430 --> 37:48.590
- WE'LL CONVICT YOU.
SIGN AGAIN.

37:48.630 --> 37:51.497
- OOH, I LOOK FORWARD TO A TRIAL
WITH NO PHYSICAL EVIDENCE.

37:51.530 --> 37:53.862
[chuckles]

37:53.900 --> 37:56.368
NOW I WANT TO POSE
A QUESTION TO YOU, SHAWN,

37:56.400 --> 37:57.731
AND I WANT YOU TO CONSIDER IT
SINCERELY.

37:57.770 --> 37:59.909
- SHOOT.
- LUNCH? FRIDAY?

37:59.940 --> 38:02.500
- MM, I'LL VISIT YOU
IN PRISON.

38:02.540 --> 38:05.373
- I'D SCHEDULE THAT SOONER
THAN LATER.

38:05.410 --> 38:07.970
- LET'S GO.

38:08.010 --> 38:09.511
- OH, LASSIE,
WHERE'S JULIET?

38:09.550 --> 38:10.642
- SHE'LL MEET ME
AT THE AIRPORT.

38:10.680 --> 38:11.783
- WELL, WHERE IS SHE NOW?

38:11.820 --> 38:13.640
- SHE WENT TO GO CLEAR HER HEAD.

38:13.690 --> 38:17.387
WHAT AM I,
HER SOCIAL SECRETARY?

38:17.420 --> 38:18.785
- TOODLE-OO.

38:26.770 --> 38:27.998
- [sighs]

38:30.800 --> 38:32.734
HEY.

38:32.770 --> 38:36.729
YOU KNOW, THIS BRIDGE
WAS BUILT BY PORCUPINES.

38:36.780 --> 38:39.749
YEAH, THEY CHEWED THE GIRDERS
WITH THEIR LITTLE TEETH.

38:39.780 --> 38:42.010
APPARENTLY THERE WAS,
LIKE, A RABIES OUTBREAK

38:42.050 --> 38:44.541
DURING CONSTRUCTION.

38:44.590 --> 38:45.739
THEY TRIED TO UNIONIZE.

38:45.790 --> 38:47.712
- SHAWN, CAN WE NOT DO THIS
RIGHT NOW?

38:47.750 --> 38:50.014
I'M REALLY UPSET
WITH YOU.

38:50.060 --> 38:53.757
WE JUST--
WE MISSED THE MOMENT.

38:53.790 --> 38:55.428
SOME PEOPLE JUST DON'T FIT.

38:55.460 --> 38:57.348
- YEAH, BUT THOSE
ARE LEGO PEOPLE.

38:57.400 --> 38:58.628
AND HOW COULD THEY?

38:58.670 --> 39:00.558
I MEAN, THEY MAKE
SO MANY DIFFERENT SIZES

39:00.600 --> 39:01.464
FOR ALL THE DIFFERENT SETS.

39:01.500 --> 39:03.138
THEY'RE IN A BOX,
THEY'RE IN A BUCKET,

39:03.170 --> 39:04.535
AND KIDS GET HIM MIXED UP.

39:04.570 --> 39:06.709
AND DON'T EVEN GET ME STARTED
ON DUPLOS.

39:06.740 --> 39:08.503
THOSE THINGS
ARE, LIKE, TWICE THE SIZE

39:08.540 --> 39:10.679
SO BABIES WON'T EAT THEM.
- THAT'S FUNNY.

39:10.710 --> 39:13.042
IT'S ALWAYS FUNNY.

39:13.080 --> 39:14.638
CAN WE NOT DO THIS RIGHT NOW?

39:14.680 --> 39:17.740
IT'S OKAY.

39:17.780 --> 39:19.987
THE WAY THINGS ARE,
IT'S OKAY.

39:21.690 --> 39:26.753
I JUST REALLY NEED TO SORT
THIS OUT ON MY OWN RIGHT NOW.

39:41.780 --> 39:46.444
- CAN I JUST SAY WHAT I CAME
HERE TO SAY, PLEASE?

39:46.480 --> 39:48.414
I HAVE A MOTORCYCLE.

39:48.450 --> 39:50.668
- YES. YOU DO.

39:50.720 --> 39:51.687
- YES. I DO.

39:51.720 --> 39:52.744
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?

39:52.790 --> 39:55.452
IT IS--
IT IS THE PUREST FORM

39:55.490 --> 39:57.708
OF FREEDOM
THAT I HAVE EVER EXPERIENCED.

39:57.760 --> 40:00.183
YOU ZIP THROUGH TRAFFIC.
YOU PARK ANYWHERE.

40:00.230 --> 40:02.118
YOU NEVER HAVE TO TAKE ANYONE
TO THE AIRPORT.

40:02.160 --> 40:03.696
YOU CERTAINLY DON'T HAVE
TO HELP ANYONE MOVE.

40:03.730 --> 40:05.891
EASILY THE BEST PURCHASE
I'VE EVER MADE

40:05.930 --> 40:08.728
IN MY LIFE,
AND I HAVE NEVER REGRETTED IT,

40:08.770 --> 40:10.135
NOT FOR ONE SECOND.

40:10.170 --> 40:12.934
- GREAT.
YOU LOVE YOUR MOTORCYCLE.

40:12.970 --> 40:14.733
IS THERE A POINT TO THIS?

40:14.780 --> 40:16.634
- YEAH, THERE'S A POINT.

40:16.680 --> 40:21.617
THE POINT IS,
SINCE I MET YOU...

40:23.520 --> 40:25.181
I'VE BEEN THINKING
ABOUT GETTING A CAR.

40:30.160 --> 40:32.924
- AND YOU'RE NOT THINKING
SOMETHING PRACTICAL OR...

40:32.960 --> 40:34.621
- OH, GOD, NO.
- SENSIBLE?

40:34.660 --> 40:35.729
- I'M NOT THROWING IN THE TOWEL
ALTOGETHER.

40:35.760 --> 40:38.695
[Elvis' Such A Night]

40:38.730 --> 40:46.933
*

41:06.730 --> 41:09.654
- THIS IS AWESOME.

41:09.700 --> 41:11.998
- OH. SORRY.

41:12.030 --> 41:13.622
- WE NEVER DO THIS.

41:13.670 --> 41:14.694
- ONCE WE DID IT.

41:14.740 --> 41:16.059
- WELL, I MEAN,
NOT LIKE THIS.

41:16.100 --> 41:18.068
- THIS IS AN ESCALATION
OF ANYTHING

41:18.100 --> 41:20.807
THAT HAPPENED PREVIOUSLY.

41:20.840 --> 41:21.829
YOU THINK WE SHOULD ADJOURN
SOMEWHERE ELSE?

41:21.880 --> 41:23.700
- YES.

41:31.150 --> 41:33.118
[both shriek]

41:33.150 --> 41:35.710
[laughter]

41:35.760 --> 41:37.284
- IS THIS ON SALE?

41:37.320 --> 41:40.687
- I DON'T WORK HERE.

41:41.760 --> 41:43.728
I LIKE YOUR PEARLS.

41:43.760 --> 41:46.797
- YOU'RE VERY NICE
FOR A SLUT.

42:02.750 --> 42:05.639
- YOU KNOW WHAT,
MAYBE NOW'S NOT THE TIME.

42:05.690 --> 42:08.181
I HAVE A FLIGHT
IN AN HOUR.

42:08.220 --> 42:11.758
- WAIT A MINUTE.
I HAVE A ROOM.

42:11.790 --> 42:13.985
A REALLY NICE ONE.

42:14.030 --> 42:16.555
PAID FOR
BY A CONVICTED CRIMINAL.

42:16.600 --> 42:18.192
- WHY DO YOU TELL ME
THESE THINGS?

42:18.230 --> 42:20.664
- FULL DISCLOSURE.
