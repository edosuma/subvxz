11:46.831 --> 11:50.334
How come you can fly to Hawaii,
but you can't fly to England?

11:50.501 --> 11:54.839
How come you can drive your car,
but you can't do your own laundry?

11:56.841 --> 11:58.801
Have a good trip.

11:58.968 --> 12:00.761
Thanks again, Niles.

12:00.928 --> 12:02.471
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

12:02.638 --> 12:04.348
I wish I could walk you to the gate,
but...

12:04.515 --> 12:06.934
Yeah, well, we better hurry
if we're gonna pass customs.

12:07.101 --> 12:09.854
It's the same country, Mom.

12:10.020 --> 12:13.148
- I'm gonna miss you so much.
- Dear God, I know.

12:23.284 --> 12:26.370
Well, that's gonna be a good time.

12:26.537 --> 12:28.831
I do feel a little guilty,
but it's for a greater good.

12:28.998 --> 12:31.625
- Where to, Niles?
- Uh, Virgin Atlantic. It's right there.

12:31.792 --> 12:33.294
What's this?
Are you going somewhere?

12:33.460 --> 12:36.505
England. I'm gonna find Daphne's
father and bring him back here

12:36.672 --> 12:38.716
if I have to check every pub
in Manchester.

12:38.883 --> 12:40.968
- You can't be serious.
- I can't do my own laundry

12:41.135 --> 12:43.637
because I can't carry the basket
and my cane at the same time.

12:43.804 --> 12:45.764
That's what I should have said.

12:48.350 --> 12:50.185
Daphne wants to get
her parents back together,

12:50.894 --> 12:53.856
and I'm gonna try
to make that happen.

12:54.690 --> 12:56.984
At the very least,
he's gonna walk her down that aisle.

12:57.151 --> 13:00.195
- It'll be the biggest surprise ever.
- It's a beautiful gesture, Niles.

13:00.362 --> 13:02.072
MARTIN:
Bye.

13:02.698 --> 13:04.617
Why didn't you tell me
he was going to England?

13:04.783 --> 13:07.661
Same reason I didn't tell him
you were going to Wisconsin.

13:07.828 --> 13:09.204
- Which way?
- Oh, right.

13:09.371 --> 13:12.207
Uh, it's Concourse B.

13:12.374 --> 13:16.086
Think this is a smart plan,
surprising Roz in front of her family?

13:16.253 --> 13:18.422
Well, what else would you suggest
I do, Dad?

13:18.589 --> 13:20.341
I couldn't reach her.
Roz and I gotta talk

13:20.507 --> 13:22.968
before this turns into
a permanent divide in our friendship.

13:23.135 --> 13:25.804
Okay. But you know what she's
gonna see when she looks at you.

13:25.971 --> 13:28.557
I know, my naked body.
I'll have you know there are worse...

13:28.724 --> 13:31.560
All right, just stop there. I've got
enough horror shows in my head.

13:32.353 --> 13:33.645
- Here we are.
- Thank you.

13:33.812 --> 13:35.439
Oh, by the way, Dad,

13:35.606 --> 13:41.278
I got you a little something
to keep you company while I'm away.

13:41.820 --> 13:44.615
Oh, no way!

13:44.782 --> 13:46.492
- The robot dog.
- Yeah.

13:46.658 --> 13:48.077
- Thanks, son.
- Sure.

13:48.243 --> 13:52.164
Oh, good, you got the girl one
so it won't fight with Eddie.

13:53.707 --> 13:55.376
Dad, it's not a girl.

13:55.542 --> 13:57.211
That's where the batteries go.

14:04.802 --> 14:07.429
Hi. Um, I'm looking for Roz Doyle.

14:07.596 --> 14:10.015
Oh, well, she's out shopping
with her cousin right now.

14:10.182 --> 14:13.102
But come in. I'm her sister, Denise.

14:13.268 --> 14:16.438
- Oh, well, it's a pleasure to meet you.
- Oh, likewise.

14:16.605 --> 14:19.650
All we've been hearing is
Roger this, and Roger that,

14:19.817 --> 14:21.860
- but we've seen no Roger.
- Yes. Well, l...

14:22.027 --> 14:24.738
We were beginning to think
that you didn't really exist.

14:24.905 --> 14:27.533
- I'm afraid you've made a mistake.
- Well, obviously, we did,

14:27.699 --> 14:28.742
but you can't blame us.

14:28.909 --> 14:31.829
It wouldn't be the first time
that she's made up a boyfriend.

14:32.871 --> 14:37.251
We've really been having a lot of fun
with her.

14:37.417 --> 14:39.837
Oh, honey, look, Roger is here.

14:40.003 --> 14:43.298
- There really is one.
- Well, I'll be a son of a gun.

14:43.465 --> 14:45.259
Good to know you.
Craig Dawson, MetLife.

14:45.425 --> 14:48.262
Hi. Roger Hammerstein.

14:48.428 --> 14:49.471
DENISE:
Oh.

14:50.722 --> 14:52.307
Well, come on in
and meet everyone.

14:52.474 --> 14:54.726
- Oh, good, thank you.
- Roger, this is Aunt Pearl

14:54.893 --> 14:56.103
- and Curtis.
FRASIER: Hello.

14:56.270 --> 14:57.980
- And Great Uncle Olaf.
FRASIER: Oh, hi.

14:58.147 --> 15:00.399
Well, honey, it looks like you owe Roz
an apology.

15:00.566 --> 15:02.860
DENISE: Oh, no, she knows
I was just teasing her.

15:03.026 --> 15:06.321
I'm just relieved
that she's finally found someone.

15:06.488 --> 15:10.617
We just want her to have
the kind of happiness that we found.

15:10.784 --> 15:12.953
Well, you know,
I intend to do everything in my power

15:13.120 --> 15:15.956
to give her just that. I love Roz.
And I intend to prove it to her.

15:16.123 --> 15:19.126
- That's why I've come.
- Oh, my God, what's going on?

15:19.293 --> 15:23.797
- Roz.
- Oh, Roger, can Craig fix you a drink?

15:23.964 --> 15:26.633
- Roger?
- Yeah, sweetheart, hi.

15:26.800 --> 15:28.969
I'd love that drink.

15:29.803 --> 15:31.430
DENISE:
Well, well, well.

15:31.597 --> 15:34.683
Looks like you've really made
an impression on Roger here, Roz.

15:34.850 --> 15:36.810
ROZ: Yeah.
- How did you two meet again?

15:36.977 --> 15:41.273
Gosh, well, it's... It's the cutest story.
Here, come on, honey, sit down. Uh...

15:41.440 --> 15:46.820
Uh, actually, um, it all started
when Alice used to wave at me

15:46.987 --> 15:50.866
when I was driving
my trash-collecting truck.

15:51.033 --> 15:52.618
Oh.

15:52.784 --> 15:56.330
Well, I guess Alice is sure
gonna be happy to see you again.

15:56.496 --> 16:01.168
Oh, well, you know, it's funny.
As well as, uh, Alice and I get along,

16:01.335 --> 16:04.838
she always mistakes me
for Roz's boss.

16:05.005 --> 16:06.882
- It's weird, isn't it?
- Oh, yeah.

16:07.049 --> 16:08.759
- Here we are.
- Oh, uh, thank you.

16:08.925 --> 16:10.594
So, Roger, I hear you're a big golfer.

16:10.761 --> 16:12.054
What do you shoot?

16:12.679 --> 16:17.184
Well, you know, actually, since I met
Roz, um, I don't get much time for golf.

16:17.351 --> 16:19.519
Well, don't get too used to that, Roz.

16:19.686 --> 16:22.606
I've been a golf widow
ever since I've been married.

16:22.773 --> 16:25.025
It's like a disease with them.

16:25.192 --> 16:27.778
Well, maybe with, uh, most men,
but not with me.

16:27.944 --> 16:29.571
I mean, my spare time is precious

16:29.738 --> 16:32.532
so I like to spend it
with the people that I love.

16:32.699 --> 16:38.955
Like Roz and Alice, and, who knows,
maybe someday some more little ones.

16:39.122 --> 16:40.165
DENISE:
Aw.

16:40.332 --> 16:42.417
Especially if they look like this here.

16:42.584 --> 16:45.337
Oh, my God, I hated that picture.

16:45.504 --> 16:50.801
Big ugly glasses and I guess
I was trying to look like Dorothy Hamill.

16:50.967 --> 16:55.055
We warned you not to get that haircut,
but you insisted.

16:55.222 --> 16:57.224
You know, if I'd met this girl
in the fifth grade,

16:57.391 --> 16:59.643
I wouldn't have dated anybody else.

16:59.810 --> 17:01.978
Gosh, can I get a copy of this
for my desk at work?

17:02.145 --> 17:06.233
- You have a desk?
- Dashboard. Heh, heh. You know.

17:08.568 --> 17:11.821
Yeah, I looked
in the "getting started" section.

17:12.489 --> 17:14.241
Yeah, I did that.

17:14.407 --> 17:16.701
Voice activation?
Yeah, I did everything it said.

Huh?

17:20.579 --> 17:23.165
Appendix B?
Well, where is Appendix B?

17:23.333 --> 17:26.670
I just want this damn thing
to do some tricks.

17:28.046 --> 17:29.965
Can't you make these things easier?

17:30.132 --> 17:31.883
You shouldn't have to be
a rocket scientist

17:32.050 --> 17:33.218
to play with some stupid toy.

17:33.385 --> 17:34.428
[EDDIE BARKS]

17:34.594 --> 17:36.847
Eddie, be quiet. I'm on the phone.

17:40.475 --> 17:43.145
So this one's getting tired,
she wants to head back up the beach,

17:43.311 --> 17:48.400
when finally she sees the blanket
surrounded by candles,

17:48.567 --> 17:50.527
and the food and the wine
that I'd set up.

17:50.694 --> 17:53.405
And don't forget the diamond bracelet
you gave me.

17:53.572 --> 17:55.365
CROWD:
Aw.

17:56.283 --> 17:59.286
I had no idea there was that kind
of money in the garbage business.

17:59.953 --> 18:02.789
You have no idea
about a lot of things.

18:02.956 --> 18:04.457
What's that supposed to mean?

18:04.624 --> 18:07.460
Well, why can't you be more like him
and do something special for me

18:07.627 --> 18:09.004
once in a while?

18:09.171 --> 18:12.132
Why can't you be more like her
and not be such a nag?

18:18.471 --> 18:22.309
That was the best half-hour
I have ever spent with my family.

18:22.475 --> 18:26.021
Thank you.
But what are you doing here?

18:26.188 --> 18:28.106
I just had to make sure
we were okay.

18:28.273 --> 18:31.568
- I told you we were okay.
- Yeah, I know. Then you ran away.

18:31.735 --> 18:33.653
I know. I should have stayed
and talked to you.

18:33.820 --> 18:37.032
It's just, usually when I'm freaked out
I turn to you.

18:37.198 --> 18:39.659
And this time I just didn't feel
like I could.

18:39.826 --> 18:40.869
[SIGHS]

18:41.578 --> 18:43.371
- I'm so sorry.
- For what?

18:43.538 --> 18:45.749
For that. For that evening. That...

18:45.916 --> 18:48.835
You were vulnerable
and I feel like I took advantage of you.

18:49.002 --> 18:51.129
Oh, Frasier, I'm a grownup.

18:51.296 --> 18:54.049
And I make my own decisions.

18:54.215 --> 18:56.134
I was just worried that...

18:56.301 --> 19:00.680
Well, over the years we've almost
gone to bed a couple of times,

19:00.847 --> 19:04.809
and we haven't because we were
afraid it would damage our friendship.

19:04.976 --> 19:07.646
- Now we've done it.
- Right.

19:08.355 --> 19:13.068
I was just worried that things
have changed between us.

19:13.234 --> 19:15.612
That's what I came here to ask you.

19:22.994 --> 19:27.707
I remember the last time I sat here,
just like this.

19:27.874 --> 19:30.877
My old high-school boyfriend
sat right where you are

19:31.044 --> 19:34.464
and he told me he'd been accepted
into college in Boston.

19:34.631 --> 19:35.715
Hmm.

19:35.882 --> 19:39.260
And I just stared at his shoelaces.

19:39.427 --> 19:42.889
I was afraid I'd cry
if I looked anywhere else, you know.

19:43.056 --> 19:49.020
Anyway, we promised
that we would always be friends.

19:49.187 --> 19:51.022
And it was just the saddest thing
in the world

19:51.189 --> 19:53.233
because I knew it wasn't true.

19:54.109 --> 19:55.902
And this time?

19:58.446 --> 20:01.366
We will always be friends, Frasier.

20:01.533 --> 20:04.244
Nothing's gonna ever change that.

20:07.914 --> 20:12.293
I can't believe
you travelled all this way.

20:13.128 --> 20:16.047
Well, that's what people do
when they care about someone.
