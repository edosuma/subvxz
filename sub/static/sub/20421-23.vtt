00:22.330 --> 00:23.250
Okay!

01:56.740 --> 01:59.100
My lord, do you want some jam?

01:59.100 --> 02:01.030
No, this is a hot dog.

02:01.030 --> 02:01.990
I see.

02:02.330 --> 02:04.400
Naotsugu, how about some mustard?

02:04.400 --> 02:05.980
I'm eating pancakes.

02:07.840 --> 02:08.850
I did that on purpose.

02:10.360 --> 02:13.180
So, it's the second day of the Scale Festival.

02:13.180 --> 02:14.550
What will you be doing, Minori?

02:14.980 --> 02:16.750
I do have some plans.

02:16.750 --> 02:20.120
It's a festival, so you've gotta 
make the most of it. Right, Minori?

02:20.510 --> 02:21.260
Yeah.

02:23.250 --> 02:25.440
I'll be taking the dog for a walk.

02:25.440 --> 02:27.870
Who are you talking about, Miss Isuzu?

02:28.090 --> 02:31.610
Will you be spending the day fighting 
hordes of paperwork again, Shiroe?

02:31.610 --> 02:32.880
Yes, I think so.

02:33.190 --> 02:36.220
I'd love to help you...

02:36.220 --> 02:38.680
But I have a mission.

02:38.990 --> 02:40.280
A mission?

02:40.820 --> 02:42.550
Food safety inspections.

02:43.510 --> 02:45.250
Food safety inspections?

02:45.770 --> 02:51.690
<b>Student of the Mage</b>

02:47.050 --> 02:48.970

02:51.690 --> 02:54.150
<b>Scale Festival</b>

02:54.150 --> 02:57.060
This spicy sauce is delicious!

02:58.060 --> 03:00.320
Now, what do I eat next?

03:00.690 --> 03:02.660
You just want to eat.

03:02.880 --> 03:05.110
That's what you call a "safety inspection"?

03:05.110 --> 03:06.520
No, you see...

03:06.520 --> 03:08.910
Okay, at least tell me the recipe!

03:10.960 --> 03:12.590
You want to steal my unique flavor?

03:12.590 --> 03:13.920
I won't tell you anything.

03:13.920 --> 03:16.890
Now, now, you two.

03:16.890 --> 03:18.880
They say a festival always has fights,

03:18.880 --> 03:20.930
but let's settle this peacefully.

03:23.720 --> 03:26.310
A hamburger feast after a good deed!

03:26.310 --> 03:27.590
Learn some moderation.

03:29.050 --> 03:31.680
You're in a good mood this morning, shrimp.

03:32.240 --> 03:33.440
You're imagining it.

03:33.440 --> 03:35.020
And don't call me shrimp.

03:35.910 --> 03:38.570
Did something good happen with Shiro?

03:38.850 --> 03:40.950
D-Don't be stupid!

03:41.400 --> 03:42.290
I'll cut you!

03:42.290 --> 03:43.400
Now, now...

03:43.890 --> 03:45.010
Here's yours.

03:47.240 --> 03:50.210
This goes way beyond oversized, but...

03:50.460 --> 03:53.220
Mustard and avocado and tomatoes...

03:54.830 --> 03:56.280
Oh, it's Shiro!

03:58.000 --> 03:59.460
Just kidding!

03:59.660 --> 04:01.530
Nice reaction!

04:01.530 --> 04:02.970
Why, you...

04:03.260 --> 04:04.600
Prepare to die!

04:04.600 --> 04:06.050
Oh, right.

04:06.050 --> 04:07.130
Here.

04:07.940 --> 04:09.490
What is this?

04:09.490 --> 04:10.870
A stamp card.

04:10.870 --> 04:12.730
Each stand you visit will give you one stamp.

04:12.880 --> 04:14.330
By the way,

04:15.130 --> 04:17.150
I only have one more to go.

04:17.470 --> 04:18.730
What?

04:18.730 --> 04:22.740
<b>Stamp Rally</b>

04:19.120 --> 04:22.740
"Get all the stamps, and win a wonderful prize"?

04:23.010 --> 04:24.970
I wonder what the prize is.

04:24.970 --> 04:27.500
Maybe it's a pair of pure white...

04:27.500 --> 04:28.490
Pure white?

04:28.840 --> 04:30.560
Lacy pant—

04:32.430 --> 04:35.500
Y-You didn't have to hit me so hard, you—

04:35.500 --> 04:36.990
Huh? She's gone!

04:38.440 --> 04:40.510
Damn you, Stupid-tsugu!

04:44.040 --> 04:47.600
Okay, Minori... I'm off to 
go help Crescent Moon.

04:47.930 --> 04:49.510
See you later, Tohya!

04:50.040 --> 04:53.770

05:04.130 --> 05:07.400
You want to go see Karashin, then.

05:07.400 --> 05:08.540
All right.

05:08.540 --> 05:09.830
Thank you.

05:09.830 --> 05:11.290
No problem.

05:12.100 --> 05:15.290
By the way, why are you inside those boxes?

05:15.290 --> 05:18.420
Well... It's good for the skin.

05:18.420 --> 05:19.870
Oh, Minori!

05:19.870 --> 05:20.940
Hello, there.

05:20.940 --> 05:23.300
Have you seen Marielle?

05:23.300 --> 05:25.550

and now she's gone...

05:31.130 --> 05:34.060
Naotsugu just wanted to eat, after all.

05:34.460 --> 05:35.820
I'm sure.

05:35.820 --> 05:40.280
With that iron stomach of his, he'd never 
even know if something were poisoned.

05:40.570 --> 05:42.120
You're right.

05:46.680 --> 05:49.260
Hmm. I don't understand at all.

05:49.970 --> 05:51.360
Um...

05:52.790 --> 05:54.320
You're in the way.

05:56.820 --> 05:58.040
Oh, right.

05:58.040 --> 06:01.210
Henrietta wanted me to send you over.

06:01.680 --> 06:03.370

06:03.830 --> 06:05.010
Understood.

06:05.590 --> 06:06.380

06:18.580 --> 06:20.360
Huh? Only one stamp?

06:21.700 --> 06:22.480

06:23.280 --> 06:25.470

06:27.370 --> 06:29.240
Curse you, shrimp!

06:29.870 --> 06:32.740
Actually, I guess I can just go eat more!

07:11.610 --> 07:12.680
What do you mean?

07:12.680 --> 07:16.360
Minori's trying to restore Shiroe's reputation.

07:16.360 --> 07:17.840
She's working hard.

07:18.380 --> 07:20.020
His reputation, huh?

07:20.580 --> 07:24.420
He should really step out and 
show his stuff a little more.

07:24.850 --> 07:27.920
He always just leaves all that to Crusty.

07:35.630 --> 07:37.310
That's nonsense!

07:37.310 --> 07:39.840
It's your fault for using a beat-up carriage!

07:39.840 --> 07:41.120
What?

07:41.120 --> 07:43.190
Just get out of the way!

07:43.190 --> 07:45.320
There's a line forming behind you!

07:45.520 --> 07:46.600
How rude.

07:46.600 --> 07:49.830
You're only talking to us that way 
because we're People of the Land!

07:49.830 --> 07:51.070
No, I'm not!

07:51.070 --> 07:53.300
I'm just telling you not to block the road!

07:53.300 --> 07:54.380
This won't do.

07:56.170 --> 07:58.180
Come on, now, gentlemen!

Akihabara's a peaceful place, so no fighting—

08:04.490 --> 08:07.840
You don't have time to rest, Marie.

08:08.060 --> 08:11.300
You know I'm not cut out for heavy lifting.

08:11.300 --> 08:14.280
Everyone's busy since we brought 
Crescent Moon Burgers back.

08:14.280 --> 08:16.850
We need to carry this stuff ourselves.

08:17.190 --> 08:18.170

08:19.420 --> 08:21.040

I guess I have no choice.

08:23.980 --> 08:25.730
Yes, it's me.

08:25.730 --> 08:27.660
Sorry to interrupt when you're having fun.

08:27.660 --> 08:28.890
Umeko?

08:28.890 --> 08:35.090
That's right. We don't have enough men 
to carry all these boxes for our sale.

08:35.760 --> 08:39.350
Yes, Marie could have just asked you herself,

08:39.350 --> 08:41.300
but she's being all hesitant.

08:41.300 --> 08:43.040
She's so cute!

08:43.490 --> 08:45.310
Wh-Who are you talking to?

08:45.310 --> 08:46.570
I'm on the phone.

08:46.570 --> 08:47.400
Be quiet.

08:47.400 --> 08:51.050
But you're talking about me! I can't be quiet!

08:48.550 --> 08:51.350
Oh, you'll help me,

08:51.350 --> 08:52.690
Naotsugu?

08:54.060 --> 08:56.570
Yes, Marie will be very happy.

08:56.570 --> 08:57.920
See you soon.

08:58.360 --> 08:59.250
Jeez...

08:59.740 --> 09:01.900
Why are you so mean to me?

09:01.900 --> 09:03.880
I'm not being mean.

09:03.880 --> 09:05.810
I'm trying to help you.

09:06.090 --> 09:08.400
I'm going to take a shower.

09:08.400 --> 09:09.490
Right now?

09:11.160 --> 09:13.550
I won't run away, so don't worry.

09:14.180 --> 09:17.070
It'd be rude to see him when I'm this sweaty.

09:18.420 --> 09:20.450
<i>She's always so honest with herself.</i>

09:21.270 --> 09:22.830
<i>I'm jealous.</i>

09:23.390 --> 09:25.670
<i>But I, on the other hand...</i>

09:27.260 --> 09:28.150
<i>Oh, no!</i>

09:28.590 --> 09:32.060
<i>I mean, sure, he's an attractive guy...</i>

09:32.060 --> 09:35.710
<i>But he's only the best of 
all the guys I actually know.</i>

09:36.420 --> 09:38.890
<i>Who am I making these excuses to?</i>

09:40.110 --> 09:41.720
Why are you standing there spacing out?

09:43.320 --> 09:44.290
Oh, dear!

09:44.290 --> 09:45.700
Don't surprise me like that!

09:45.700 --> 09:47.400
You're the one who called for me.

09:47.400 --> 09:49.990
Th-That's right.

09:50.900 --> 09:54.880
<i>Maybe I simply act too indifferent...</i>

09:55.660 --> 09:56.970
Is something wrong?

09:56.970 --> 09:58.370
No... Not at all.

09:58.640 --> 10:03.120
This afternoon, we're setting up 
a stand to sell winter clothing.

10:07.960 --> 10:10.770
You aren't planning something again, are you?

10:10.770 --> 10:13.550
You'll just be working in the background.

10:13.550 --> 10:16.130
Then it doesn't need to be me, does it?

10:16.440 --> 10:20.570
Shiroe will be coming later...

10:22.270 --> 10:24.440
Okay, I'll consider it.

10:25.840 --> 10:27.820
What a straightforward personality!

10:27.820 --> 10:29.020
Like a puppy!

10:29.290 --> 10:30.610
Yo!

10:29.290 --> 10:32.310
This is the life I live!

10:30.610 --> 10:32.440
Uh... What's going on here?

10:32.310 --> 10:34.470

10:48.840 --> 10:52.310
Could you put some more flowers over there?

10:52.310 --> 10:54.050
Yes, understood.

10:54.370 --> 10:56.780
I think that'll basically do it...

11:02.710 --> 11:04.640
It comes with three meals and a nap.

11:06.820 --> 11:08.390
It comes with three meals and a nap.

11:09.760 --> 11:12.770
He tricked me again. Honestly...

11:13.430 --> 11:17.410
It's that mean monster's fault that I'm so busy.

11:17.830 --> 11:22.780
I should remind him which of us 
has the greater power here.

11:23.220 --> 11:25.580
I'm already well aware of that, so there's no need.

11:26.880 --> 11:29.290
H-How did...

11:30.300 --> 11:32.990
Elissa let me through.

11:33.750 --> 11:35.800
What are you doing here?

11:36.160 --> 11:39.230
For once, you're actually doing some work,

11:39.230 --> 11:41.270
so I thought I'd come to give sympathy.

11:43.000 --> 11:45.710
Whose fault do you think this is?

11:47.140 --> 11:50.340
I'm told the Twilight Banquet was your idea.

11:51.330 --> 11:55.510
It's my way of thanking the adventurers.

11:56.520 --> 11:59.690
It was smart to use a number of smaller tables,

11:59.690 --> 12:03.040
rather than a single big one, 
where people are ordered by rank.

12:03.960 --> 12:06.830
Adventurers dislike the nobles' useless formalities.

12:07.170 --> 12:11.080
Yes, I think I understand that a little now.

12:11.460 --> 12:13.030

Hey, are you sure about this?

I wonder if each territory has its own forms.

12:56.240 --> 12:58.370
I don't know...

12:58.370 --> 12:59.630
What a pain.

12:59.890 --> 13:02.630
I'll start by organizing them.

13:03.170 --> 13:04.130
Oh?

13:04.130 --> 13:07.760
Minori, I didn't know your subclass was scribe.

13:08.040 --> 13:10.240
No, it's apprentice.

13:09.390 --> 13:11.180
<b>Minori 
Race/ Human

13:10.880 --> 13:12.770
I... I like...

13:11.180 --> 13:12.770
<b>

Subclass 
Apprentice, Lv. 21</b>

13:14.200 --> 13:17.990
I'd like to ask you about my skills.

13:20.120 --> 13:21.990
You want to change your subclass?

13:22.220 --> 13:25.550
Yes, but I don't know what to pick.

13:27.660 --> 13:29.840
Then what about this?

13:29.840 --> 13:32.920
There's a subclass called "apprentice."

13:33.510 --> 13:35.080
Apprentice?

13:35.950 --> 13:37.510
It's exactly what it sounds like...

13:38.090 --> 13:40.500
It makes you someone's apprentice.

13:41.130 --> 13:45.050
You can become someone's student, 
and copy their skills.

13:45.050 --> 13:46.510
That's amazing.

13:47.080 --> 13:49.500
But there are limits on which skills you can learn.

13:49.890 --> 13:51.920
You can only gain the skills for your level.

13:52.330 --> 13:55.090
But you get a bonus, so it levels up quickly.

13:55.090 --> 13:58.410
And when you change classes, 
you keep your experience points.

14:00.020 --> 14:03.210
Until you decide what you want to do, 
it might not be a bad idea.

14:05.490 --> 14:06.720
I've decided.

14:06.720 --> 14:09.220
I'll become an apprentice!

14:09.220 --> 14:10.710
That was fast!

14:10.710 --> 14:13.520
But you already have your tailoring skill...

14:13.520 --> 14:17.010
No, I didn't pick that because I liked it.

14:17.450 --> 14:18.880
And so...

14:19.290 --> 14:22.380
Shiroe, will you be my teacher?

14:23.390 --> 14:24.380
Me?

14:25.070 --> 14:29.210
<i>I changed my subclass because 
I wanted to be useful to Shiroe.</i>

14:31.220 --> 14:34.320
<i>If I can be of use to the people of Akihabara,</i>

14:34.320 --> 14:37.770
<i>it might help my teacher's reputation.</i>

14:39.350 --> 14:43.780
<i>And for that, I must start by doing 
what I can, one step at a time!</i>

14:44.600 --> 14:47.550
<i>This is my battlefield!</i>

14:50.690 --> 14:51.780
That's amazing...

14:52.950 --> 14:55.290
You work fast, Minori!

14:55.870 --> 14:57.980
I'm Shiroe's student, after all.

14:58.960 --> 15:01.460
<b>Linguini</b>

15:01.750 --> 15:03.850
This is great!

15:03.850 --> 15:06.720
The tomato sauce here is delicious.

15:06.720 --> 15:10.970
Now I'll have enough energy to go back 
to Crescent Moon this afternoon!

15:10.970 --> 15:13.110
There's the smile I wanted to see.

15:13.110 --> 15:15.820
I'll do my best to help.

15:18.630 --> 15:20.060
I'm so sorry!

15:20.060 --> 15:21.190
What's wrong with you?

15:21.190 --> 15:22.480
Look at this stain!

15:22.670 --> 15:25.280
I'll p-pay for it, so please...

15:25.990 --> 15:29.110
You could never afford it! Honestly!

15:29.380 --> 15:33.120
This is why I told you it wasn't worth 
coming to a filthy shop like this!

15:33.490 --> 15:34.750
That's awful...

15:35.470 --> 15:37.150
Is he stupid?

15:37.150 --> 15:38.820
He chose to come here.

15:38.820 --> 15:40.500
Get lost.

15:40.670 --> 15:43.220
Which of you just insulted me?!

15:45.140 --> 15:46.500
You three, then?

15:46.500 --> 15:48.510
I'll have to teach you a lesson.

15:50.090 --> 15:51.820
You want to fight?

15:51.820 --> 15:53.010
With us?

15:55.320 --> 15:56.760
Nyanta...

15:56.760 --> 15:59.110
No need to worry.

16:00.010 --> 16:00.980
Meow.

16:01.820 --> 16:03.120
What do you want, cat?

16:03.550 --> 16:05.380
I'm not a cat.

16:05.380 --> 16:08.260
I am a proud member of the cat-people.

16:08.260 --> 16:09.540
Never heard of them.

16:09.540 --> 16:13.060
Then you really ought to learn.

16:13.060 --> 16:14.660
Wh-What are you doing?

16:14.660 --> 16:16.660
Let me go... Let me go!

16:17.830 --> 16:19.020
My lord!

16:19.020 --> 16:21.290
You shouldn't be mean to others.

16:21.680 --> 16:26.170
Akihabara has its own rules 
by which you must abide.

16:26.470 --> 16:28.680
How dare you disgrace me?!

16:28.680 --> 16:30.770
My lord, control yourself.

16:30.770 --> 16:31.650
Please!

16:32.680 --> 16:34.780
I'll get you for this, cat!

16:35.280 --> 16:37.930
<i>Nyanta is so cool!</i>

16:38.920 --> 16:40.050
<i>Meow.</i>

16:40.430 --> 16:41.940
<b>You're just playing around, 
aren't you?</b>

16:42.410 --> 16:46.080
A conflict with the People of the Land, again?

16:46.080 --> 16:49.440
You might want to beef up security.

16:49.880 --> 16:51.820
To a degree, I expected this.

16:51.820 --> 16:55.700
People of the Land live in a class-based 
society, while we're free.

16:56.060 --> 16:57.190
That's true.

16:57.570 --> 17:01.160
All of the People of the Land's traders 
at this festival are professionals,

17:01.160 --> 17:05.210
while everyone else running a 
shop here is an amateur.

17:05.670 --> 17:08.010
D.D.D. and the Black Swords are available.

17:08.010 --> 17:10.500
And that's why I have Naotsugu running around.

17:11.210 --> 17:12.990
I think we can leave things alone.

17:13.720 --> 17:15.470
Team 3 is back!

17:15.470 --> 17:16.960
Team 2, heading out!

17:16.960 --> 17:18.430
Right. Good work.

17:18.830 --> 17:20.030
Reporting.

17:20.030 --> 17:22.720
We assisted one carriage, stuck on a side road,

17:22.720 --> 17:24.230
halted four arguments,

17:24.550 --> 17:26.860
and dealt with two claims of nonpayment.

17:27.260 --> 17:28.930
All involved People of the Land.

17:29.290 --> 17:30.270
Got it.

17:30.270 --> 17:32.390
You've just got to be tough and draw the line!

17:32.390 --> 17:33.990
Keep at it.

17:33.990 --> 17:34.710
Yes, sir.

17:35.300 --> 17:39.030
But I didn't expect to see so many here.

17:39.030 --> 17:42.000
I'm sure People of the Land 
love their festivals, too.

17:42.930 --> 17:44.500
Still...

17:44.500 --> 17:49.510
It's hard to believe that villain was the one 
who brought all this business to Akihabara.

17:50.610 --> 17:54.680
I once invited him to join my guild.

17:55.820 --> 17:59.730
This was after the Tea Party disbanded, 
when he was a solo player.

18:00.940 --> 18:03.740
I'd seen how he fought while 
he was a guest of ours.

18:04.310 --> 18:05.210
And?

18:06.310 --> 18:07.610
He turned me down.

18:08.390 --> 18:11.700
"I don't think I'm worthy of the offer," he said.

18:11.700 --> 18:15.200
And so, I lost interest.

18:15.200 --> 18:19.390
I'm not interested in anyone who isn't 
ready to find and slay new enemies.

18:20.580 --> 18:23.550
And after the Apocalypse, he grew up...

18:23.960 --> 18:26.650
Enough to have an influence on the entire city.

18:27.070 --> 18:29.540
That's what I don't get...

18:29.950 --> 18:33.550
Is he a strategist? Or a gambler?

18:33.900 --> 18:36.490
I'm not even sure if he feels dead or alive.

18:37.810 --> 18:42.270
I think Shiroe is at his best when anything goes.

18:42.270 --> 18:43.520
"Anything goes"?

18:44.370 --> 18:47.060
I don't think he's a strategist at all.

18:48.310 --> 18:49.730
When the chips are down,

18:49.730 --> 18:53.600
and you have to do whatever it takes, 
and there's nothing in it for him,

18:54.320 --> 18:57.400
he's as strong as anyone you'll ever see.

18:59.210 --> 19:02.180
He's like a cursed sword.

19:02.770 --> 19:04.480
I understand...

19:04.480 --> 19:08.810
But now, that cursed sword 
is buried in paperwork.

19:09.400 --> 19:11.930
Who knows when he'll be drawn next?

19:12.950 --> 19:15.300
I guess we still have something to look forward to.

19:23.560 --> 19:25.590
Oh, I can't... I can't even...

19:23.920 --> 19:26.350
You didn't say anything about 
being in a fashion show!

19:26.350 --> 19:28.310
Didn't you say I'd be working in the background?

19:28.510 --> 19:30.380
That's right...

19:30.380 --> 19:32.190
The clothing is the star of the show.

19:32.740 --> 19:34.190
I didn't lie to you.

19:35.130 --> 19:37.190
You wear this, Shiro!

19:37.530 --> 19:38.990
This?

19:38.990 --> 19:41.110
I think it'll look good, my lord.

19:41.110 --> 19:42.530
But I'm not laughing.

19:43.030 --> 19:46.650
I haven't seen this many people 
in a long time, though...

19:47.040 --> 19:49.630
I told you I'd pay!

19:49.890 --> 19:52.080
Th-The money isn't the issue!

19:53.980 --> 19:54.820

19:55.180 --> 19:56.090

20:14.170 --> 20:15.110

20:15.550 --> 20:17.650

20:17.650 --> 20:18.990
But they feel differently.

20:19.420 --> 20:20.760
Please leave.

20:22.010 --> 20:24.200
I've got nothing to say to a young kid like you!

20:24.200 --> 20:25.410
Move!

20:28.150 --> 20:31.480
You will leave, won't you?

20:33.660 --> 20:34.900

20:34.900 --> 20:36.630
I'm never coming back.

20:57.200 --> 20:58.430
We really can't do that...

20:58.430 --> 21:00.600
I'm not moving until you say yes.

20:59.630 --> 21:01.180
Please stop...

21:00.600 --> 21:02.530
How much do I have to pay for a whole box?

21:03.060 --> 21:04.580
What's wrong, my lord?

21:04.920 --> 21:07.030
The place is getting rowdy.

21:07.230 --> 21:09.580
Yes, more than I'd anticipated.

21:10.110 --> 21:12.040
The People of the Land are acting strangely.

21:13.030 --> 21:14.600
But I don't understand it.

21:15.110 --> 21:16.530
I can't get a clear enough picture.

21:18.000 --> 21:20.170
I feel like I'm missing something...

21:22.650 --> 21:24.050
It's me, Minori.

21:24.490 --> 21:26.660
I'm going through the paperwork,

21:26.660 --> 21:27.850
and something isn't right.

21:28.280 --> 21:32.180
Some of the paperwork overlaps, 
and some of their math is wrong.

21:32.520 --> 21:35.280
There's a huge number of very basic errors.

21:35.280 --> 21:36.190
And...

21:36.520 --> 21:39.940
Most of them come from People of the Land.

21:40.580 --> 21:41.710
I see...

21:42.130 --> 21:43.450
So that's it.

21:43.660 --> 21:45.860
My lord, what will we do about the show?

21:45.860 --> 21:48.230
Minori, keep this line open.

21:48.230 --> 21:48.950
Right.

21:49.780 --> 21:54.510
Akatsuki, find Isaac and get 
a report on our security.

21:56.460 --> 22:00.760
It looks like someone is attacking Akihabara.

22:01.560 --> 22:02.900
Attacking?

22:02.900 --> 22:04.510
An enemy?

22:05.420 --> 22:07.620
I'm going to my office in the guild building.

22:08.050 --> 22:09.680
This may be an emergency.

22:15.450 --> 22:16.680
<i>I let down my guard!</i>

<i>Now they have the advantage!</i>

Shiroe senses the enemy, and takes action.

24:10.890 --> 24:14.860
But his guesswork is off, and his calculations fail.

24:14.860 --> 24:17.140

24:17.140 --> 24:18.840
What is the enemy really after?

24:18.840 --> 24:22.400
In the hour of greatest peril, the strategist 
Shiroe begins his counterattack.

24:22.400 --> 24:24.210
Next time: Chaos.
