00:00.573 --> 00:04.344
<i>[J.D] There's nothing worse than running into
a sworn enemy, first thing in the morning.</i>

00:04.433 --> 00:06.344
Well, if that's the case, Fred,
just put him on blood thinners.

00:06.412 --> 00:08.513
Excuse me, Perry. You
don't have a phone.

00:08.581 --> 00:12.650
- You're just holding your hand to your ear.
- Fred, I gotta go. He's gonna make me talk to him.

00:12.718 --> 00:16.286
Sure, I'll--I'll pass it on.
Fred says you are a tool.

00:16.355 --> 00:19.887
I got nothing. That's a good one.

00:20.015 --> 00:22.676
- Heck, yeah.
- Still no Chief of Medicine, huh?

00:22.827 --> 00:25.201
You must love not having anybody
around to make you tow the line.

00:25.302 --> 00:27.445
It's pretty much a
captainless ship around here.

00:27.480 --> 00:29.434
People showing up late,
stealing supplies...

00:29.502 --> 00:31.302
Basically doing whatever
the hell they want.

00:31.370 --> 00:36.012
Okay, as you can see, we've
repaired the perforation.

00:36.203 --> 00:37.848
Now all that's left to do is sew up

00:37.958 --> 00:39.936
The surrounding muscle tissue.
Are there any questions?

00:40.137 --> 00:43.217
- I don't think you're doing this right.
- Get outta here.

00:43.416 --> 00:44.992
All right.
Let me just touch his heart.

00:45.083 --> 00:45.784
Hey!

00:45.851 --> 00:50.778
Bottom line; if we don't get a new boss
in this place soon, it'll fall apart.

00:50.897 --> 00:53.120
I'd pretend to care,
but I don't have to.

00:53.271 --> 00:55.829
- Here's my office.
- Okay, fine.

00:55.919 --> 00:58.037
You go ahead and have fun
spending your golden years

00:58.037 --> 01:00.060
at a depressing coffee
chain surrounded by--

01:00.140 --> 01:01.147
I don't mean to cut you off, Perry,

01:01.237 --> 01:02.471
But I have to take this call.

01:04.087 --> 01:06.668
Look at that.
He brought it back.

01:07.929 --> 01:08.543
Doctor.

01:08.578 --> 01:10.942
Oh, no.
That can't be good.

01:11.010 --> 01:15.305
<i>I was still trying
to get my intern Jo</i>

01:15.305 --> 01:17.094
<i>to be more sensitive
with her patients.</i>

01:17.094 --> 01:19.802
Don't worry, Mr. Hapsburg. A lot
of people are afraid of needles.

01:19.802 --> 01:21.910
I was only surprised
because you're the first one

01:21.910 --> 01:23.988
I've come across
that doesn't have a vagina.

01:25.517 --> 01:27.092
Did you know
that guy was a priest?

01:27.213 --> 01:29.653
I did.
Uh, I'll see you tomorrow.

01:29.733 --> 01:32.130
If you're not here, I'll just
assume that demons dragged you

01:32.130 --> 01:33.795
down to hell
to chew your face off.

01:34.433 --> 01:36.334
<i>Now that
I was dating Elliot again,</i>

01:36.402 --> 01:38.703
<i>I finally had something
to get home to.</i>

01:38.771 --> 01:40.647
- Hey.
- Hi.

01:40.756 --> 01:41.438
(piano keys played)

01:42.238 --> 01:43.502
Why did you put
my piano mat here?

01:43.502 --> 01:45.677
I was here all by myself,
and I got a little freaked out.

01:44.744 --> 01:48.015
So I thought I'd use that
as a burglar alarm.

01:48.050 --> 01:50.356
(plays main theme of 'Scrubs')

01:50.356 --> 01:51.182
That's catchy.

01:51.250 --> 01:53.690
Cookies are done.

01:53.690 --> 01:56.468
I baked a dozen for you
and a dozen for me.

01:56.468 --> 01:59.179
Now I like to eat one and a half
cookies every day

01:59.179 --> 02:00.974
so that a dozen cookies
last eight days.

02:01.437 --> 02:03.690
Well, ten days because I don't
eat sugar on Wednesdays,

02:03.690 --> 02:05.597
and on Sundays I call my mom,
and she asks what's wrong with

02:05.664 --> 02:09.366
my phone because I sound fat.
Anyway, I'm gonna go change.

02:09.435 --> 02:14.490
I brought my cookie pants.
(door opens and closes)

02:15.210 --> 02:18.490
Notice the loose waist to
accommodate an expanding stomach.

02:18.525 --> 02:20.850
I finished my dozen.

02:20.850 --> 02:23.461
Why would you eat
all of your cookies at once?

02:23.461 --> 02:24.582
I mean, what did you think
was gonna happen to them?

02:27.211 --> 02:27.863
(glass shatters)

02:28.776 --> 02:31.074
(smoke grenade noise)

02:32.892 --> 02:35.427
Come to daddy.

02:35.494 --> 02:38.797
Still pretty smoky.

02:42.603 --> 02:44.470
(singsong voice)
Worth it.

02:44.630 --> 02:46.667
(thud)

02:46.799 --> 02:48.576
So he'd kill us?

02:48.714 --> 02:50.302
I told Turk
you were making cookies.

02:50.482 --> 02:52.920
Plus he has a key to my place,
and Carla's out of town.

02:53.031 --> 02:55.319
Elliot, with his diabetes,

02:55.439 --> 02:57.386
it's the only time
he gets to eat sweets.

02:57.577 --> 02:58.851
I'm dating an idiot.

02:58.953 --> 03:00.990
Yeah, but you knew
what you were gettin' into.

03:05.496 --> 03:06.942
(door creaks open)

03:07.052 --> 03:09.060
(piano mat
plays cending arpeggio)

03:09.170 --> 03:10.784
J.D., someone's in the house.
(clatter)

03:10.877 --> 03:12.767
Turk, get outta here!

03:12.767 --> 03:15.408
(piano mat plays descending
arpeggio, door closes)

03:13.366 --> 03:19.037
Pull that piano crap on me?
(scoffs) please.

[subscene.com]

03:35.647 --> 03:37.934
- Morning, sleepy.
- Mm.

03:38.004 --> 03:40.544
I gotta go to work. I wish
I had the day off, too.

03:41.654 --> 03:44.503
Hey, do you realize that we've
already been dating for a week,

03:44.623 --> 03:45.754
but we still haven't had sex?

03:45.883 --> 03:48.574
Yes, but you know what?
We're not gonna rush this time.

03:48.705 --> 03:50.969
- We're just gonna go with the flow.
- I think we should do it right now.

03:51.037 --> 03:56.539
J.D., why are you throwing
your pants at me?

03:56.539 --> 03:58.457
Because I got excited.
Whoo-hoo!

03:58.457 --> 03:59.811
Well, you should be,

03:59.811 --> 04:01.650
because tonight
when you get home,

04:01.650 --> 04:03.656
I'm going to be waiting here,
and it's gonna be

04:03.656 --> 04:06.185
the most amazing,
crazy night you've ever had.

04:07.122 --> 04:10.537
- Stop throwing dirty clothes at me!
- Stop saying sexy things.

04:10.537 --> 04:12.957
Can't wait for tonight.
(grunts)

04:17.200 --> 04:18.636
I really wish
I hadn't have done that.

04:18.636 --> 04:19.567
Yeah, me, too.

04:20.761 --> 04:23.579
<i>Mr. Lawton, one of my favorite
patients, was back.</i>

04:23.682 --> 04:26.460
<i>Unfortunately,
Jo was his intern.</i>

04:26.460 --> 04:28.366
- Hi.
- How's it going over here?

04:28.366 --> 04:32.179
Well, young Dr. Mahoney was just
observing that my heart disease

04:32.179 --> 04:34.106
was, uh, uh,
what was that, sweetheart?

04:34.206 --> 04:35.340
A giant buzzkill.

04:35.375 --> 04:36.343
- Jo.
- What?

04:36.343 --> 04:38.264
I was on cloud nine
this morning--

04:38.264 --> 04:40.301
had a good night's sleep,
hot shower,

04:40.301 --> 04:41.988
big ol' pancake breakfast.

04:41.988 --> 04:45.157
Then bang,
chronic heart disease. Buzzkill.

04:45.157 --> 04:47.554
Well, I-I'm sure
Mr. Lawton feels horrible

04:47.635 --> 04:50.434
- that his condition annoyed you.
- I doubt it.

04:50.469 --> 04:54.010
She doubts it. Okay, well, other
than the abdominal discomfort,

04:54.010 --> 04:55.945
- everything okay, sir?
- Well, I'd feel better

04:55.945 --> 04:57.432
if this bed were a
little more comfortable.

04:55.735 --> 04:59.816
Oh.
Here, lean up. Lean up.

04:59.816 --> 05:02.878
Oh! Thank you. And I'm sorry
if I ruined your day.

05:02.878 --> 05:05.876
- Eh, we're cool.
- Apparently, you guys are cool.

05:08.209 --> 05:10.909
Yeah.
Sure, I can come in then.

05:11.773 --> 05:12.992
Thank you.

05:14.809 --> 05:17.077
That was just the board.

05:17.196 --> 05:20.136
They're offering me
the Chief of Medicine job.

05:20.249 --> 05:21.965
- Shut up!
- Yeah.

05:22.094 --> 05:23.639
Do you know what this means?

05:23.639 --> 05:28.214
That when I ask our nanny how
she manages to raise her own kid

05:28.295 --> 05:30.695
without a nanny,
I can hire a second nanny

05:30.795 --> 05:32.522
to listen
to her boring answer.

05:34.285 --> 05:36.432
Perry, look at yourself.

05:36.522 --> 05:38.741
You don't get
in your own way anymore.

05:39.650 --> 05:44.012
Sweetie, I am so,
so proud of you.

05:44.133 --> 05:45.938
Thank you.

05:47.063 --> 05:48.800
I'm feeling so open
and vulnerable

05:48.909 --> 05:53.155
that it's literally filling me
up with rage and hatred.

05:53.265 --> 05:54.748
- So I should go.
- Fair enough.

05:54.847 --> 05:55.530
Okay.

05:59.074 --> 06:01.774
Say, I heard you and Barbie
were back together again.

06:01.873 --> 06:03.438
How's that going?

06:03.529 --> 06:04.610
<i>He doesn't care.
Don't answer.</i>

06:04.700 --> 06:06.075
Is there less drama this time?

06:06.195 --> 06:07.136
<i>Hold firm.</i>

06:07.237 --> 06:08.085
Does it feel different?

06:08.185 --> 06:09.640
<i>Give him nothing.</i>

06:09.721 --> 06:11.981
Look at you,
not getting sucked in.

06:12.089 --> 06:15.239
Maybe you are a little bit older
and a little bit wiser,

06:15.330 --> 06:18.682
<i>enough for this whole thing to
work out with Barbie this time.</i>

06:19.479 --> 06:20.923
I really think I am.

06:21.026 --> 06:23.111
Oh, my God. How do you not get
that I will never, ever care

06:23.182 --> 06:24.196
about your pasty,
white love life?

06:24.196 --> 06:26.844
I only brought it up
because I noticed that Barbie

06:26.844 --> 06:28.832
wasn't here at work today,
and I was hoping that

06:28.902 --> 06:31.156
your relationship with her
had already gone so far south;

06:31.156 --> 06:33.787
that you'd killed her and buried
her deep in a wooded area

06:33.787 --> 06:35.605
and that soon
you would be carted off

06:35.605 --> 06:38.055
for the aforementioned crime
of pasty, white passion.

06:38.055 --> 06:40.891
No, no such luck.
She's just at home.

06:40.891 --> 06:44.122
(scoffs) Carla, why won't you
pick up? I need to talk!

06:44.223 --> 06:46.280
I cannot believe that
you leave the country

06:46.360 --> 06:48.087
the week I get back
together with J.D

06:48.187 --> 06:50.539
I feel like
that's not a coincidence. Wait.

06:50.539 --> 06:52.875
I didn't mean that. I know that
your aunt did not fall out of that

06:52.875 --> 06:55.623
balloon on purpose.
Anyway, I promised J.D

06:55.713 --> 06:57.948
this crazy sex night,
and now I'm totally losing it.

06:57.948 --> 06:59.672
I've been trying on lingerie,
but nothing fits,

06:59.753 --> 07:02.163
because I ate an entire batch of
cookie dough last night with a spatula.

07:02.264 --> 07:04.913
Plus at my last appointment
I got in a fight with my waxer,

07:05.004 --> 07:07.232
and now there is a rash
on my bajingo that looks like

07:07.232 --> 07:09.323
a thousand tiny spider bites.
Damn it, Carla!

07:09.375 --> 07:11.644
I need tonight to be special,
and you're not there for me.

07:11.703 --> 07:13.167
And I know what
you're gonna say.

07:13.248 --> 07:15.676
You're gonna say that--
that you've always come through

07:15.777 --> 07:18.015
and that sometimes I'm selfish,
but even if that's true,

07:18.105 --> 07:19.783
I don't need to hear
your attitude right now,

07:19.813 --> 07:22.316
because I am sick of it.
Do you hear me? Sick of it!

07:22.387 --> 07:24.491
I love you. Call me.
(beep)

07:24.872 --> 07:27.420
What can I say? I just wish
you were at home with her.

07:27.521 --> 07:29.066
You and me both.

07:29.188 --> 07:30.662
That was an insult.

07:30.792 --> 07:32.349
I know. I thought if I took it
as a compliment,

07:32.429 --> 07:33.985
it would drive you insane
and you'd go away. 

07:34.055 --> 07:35.121
Damn it!

07:35.773 --> 07:39.125
Hey, J.D., because of
the abdominal discomfort,

07:39.125 --> 07:41.170
I was thinking of ordering
an endoscopy on Mr. Lawton.

07:41.170 --> 07:42.247
Yeah?

07:42.316 --> 07:44.034
No, no, he had the same
symptoms before.

07:44.144 --> 07:45.610
It turned out
it was just heartburn.

07:45.718 --> 07:48.480
An endoscopy's a really painful,
invasive procedure.

07:48.560 --> 07:50.165
Who gives a crap?

07:50.265 --> 07:53.548
Oh, I don't know, uh, Jo.
I-I think I do.

07:53.648 --> 07:55.613
Probably sounds crazy to you.

07:55.613 --> 07:57.721
Not crazy.
Just a little weird.

07:57.822 --> 07:59.548
Okay, no more sugarcoating,
all right?

07:59.658 --> 08:01.273
You will never be
a good doctor

08:01.352 --> 08:03.802
until you learn what it means
to truly care for your patients.

08:03.891 --> 08:05.778
And if I don't start
seeing some changes soon,

08:05.869 --> 08:07.844
you're gonna be out
on your ass, all right?

08:07.936 --> 08:10.815
There's your buzzkill.
Go back to work.

08:12.351 --> 08:15.030
<i>Careful. Keep your badass
doctor stare going</i>

08:15.109 --> 08:16.304
<i>in case she looks back.</i>

08:16.304 --> 08:23.468
<i>(singsong voice)
Nailed it.</i>

08:24.932 --> 08:27.049
Bob, what are you
doing up here? Are you sick?

08:27.120 --> 08:30.593
No. I'm just taking a stroll,
but thanks for your concern.

08:30.683 --> 08:33.534
Oh, I'm not concerned.
I-I meant to sound hopeful.

08:33.613 --> 08:35.429
Let me try it again.
Are you sick?

08:35.520 --> 08:37.607
Perry, why are you hating
this morning?

08:37.717 --> 08:40.849
I just came up here because
I heard the board offered you

08:40.929 --> 08:42.116
the Chief of Medicine.

08:42.116 --> 08:45.149
- They did. It's a great opportunity.
- It certainly is.

08:45.220 --> 08:48.602
The minute I took that job,
everything got bigger--

08:48.683 --> 08:52.153
My office, my staff,
my secretary's hooters.

08:52.244 --> 08:55.245
They were a Christmas bonus...
For both of us.

08:55.335 --> 08:59.280
Still, I took the job
to improve patient care,

08:59.370 --> 09:00.666
But you spend
most of your time

09:00.786 --> 09:02.150
dealing with bureaucratic garbage.

09:02.491 --> 09:04.358
And what with
the budget meetings

09:04.458 --> 09:07.127
and addressing staff
and patient complaints,

09:07.238 --> 09:08.803
you barely have time
for a life.

09:08.803 --> 09:10.690
And what is your reward?

09:10.781 --> 09:13.873
Everybody in the hospital
hates you. Yay!

09:13.953 --> 09:16.031
Anyway, chief,
congrats again.

09:18.931 --> 09:21.169
Hey, with Carla and Izzy
out of town,

09:21.230 --> 09:23.195
must be nice to have the place
to yourself for once, huh?

09:23.256 --> 09:25.355
Dude, I can't answer that.

09:25.355 --> 09:28.505
How many people here are spies
and are ordered to report

09:28.604 --> 09:30.070
everything I say
back to Carla?

09:31.697 --> 09:32.460
I should go.

09:33.665 --> 09:37.337
I love my wife,
and I wanna be by her side

09:37.438 --> 09:40.198
at all times!
All times!

09:40.277 --> 09:41.693
You heard that, Rochelle?

09:42.013 --> 09:43.486
(whispers) Psst!
Turk, come here.

09:46.302 --> 09:49.163
- Elliot, are you sick?
- No, I just don't have makeup on.

09:49.282 --> 09:51.069
You look pretty.

09:51.069 --> 09:53.378
- Turk, I need some help with J.D.
- Okay.

09:53.427 --> 09:56.356
You guys are back together.
I get that. It's great.

09:56.437 --> 09:59.288
You're a fit. I just don't wanna
get caught in the middle again.

09:59.379 --> 10:00.573
Well, you should've
thought of that

10:00.654 --> 10:02.451
before you jacked
all my cookies. You're in.

10:02.451 --> 10:04.870
Stupid sweet tooth!

10:04.950 --> 10:06.977
Dr. Reid,
when did you become homeless?

10:07.067 --> 10:08.663
Uh, these are just
my cookie pants.

10:08.753 --> 10:11.663
Oh, these are
my muffin slacks. Bam!

10:11.734 --> 10:14.202
I've been rocking these bad boys
since the day I retired.

10:14.642 --> 10:15.275
Huh.

10:17.353 --> 10:18.727
Where's Mr. Lawton?

10:18.817 --> 10:20.150
He's getting an endoscopy.

10:20.678 --> 10:24.189
Jo, please tell me
you didn't order that procedure

10:24.269 --> 10:25.404
even though
I told you not to.

10:25.484 --> 10:27.893
Well, I did, so that kind of
puts me in a pickle.

10:27.953 --> 10:31.588
Okay, I-I am so angry right now.
I-I don't even know what to say.

10:31.699 --> 10:32.602
You gotta give me a second.

10:32.703 --> 10:35.485
<i>I knew exactly what to say,
but the longer I waited,</i>

10:35.585 --> 10:37.271
<i>the more I knew
it would make her squirm.</i>

10:37.332 --> 10:38.369
<i>See, there's a lot of things</i>

10:38.450 --> 10:40.407
<i>That can leave
someone speechless.</i>

10:40.407 --> 10:41.672
How'd the meeting go, chief?

10:41.732 --> 10:42.506
Is it official?

10:42.588 --> 10:44.646
<i>It can be an answer
you don't expect.</i>

10:44.767 --> 10:47.024
I didn't go.
I don't want the job.

10:49.648 --> 10:51.845
Just tell me this one thing,
and then I'll leave you alone.

10:51.937 --> 10:54.486
<i>Or a question you wish you
didn't know the answer to.</i>

10:54.576 --> 10:57.813
If you had to come up with the
ultimate sexual experience for J.D.,

10:57.893 --> 10:59.026
what would it be?

11:01.394 --> 11:02.912
<i>For Jo, it was just gonna be</i>

11:02.992 --> 11:05.348
<i>a good, old-fashioned
verbal beat-down.</i>

11:05.428 --> 11:07.093
I don't know who
you think you are,

11:07.195 --> 11:09.443
but I promise you, you are
gonna regret this mistake

11:09.534 --> 11:10.949
- for the rest of your--
- Sorry to interrupt.

11:11.030 --> 11:13.359
Great call ordering
that endoscopy, Dr. Mahoney.

11:14.323 --> 11:17.324
Mr. Lawton
has stomach cancer.

11:19.280 --> 11:21.036
<i>Yep. Speechless.</i>

11:24.556 --> 11:25.441
<i>Time to make things right.</i>

11:25.490 --> 11:27.066
Jo, I'm sorry.

11:27.167 --> 11:29.519
I thought you were being
callous with Mr. Lawton,

11:29.620 --> 11:31.356
and you were
just being thorough.

11:31.356 --> 11:33.582
<i>God, I'm a good apologizer.</i>

11:33.653 --> 11:35.750
From now on,
I'm gonna stop riding you

11:35.840 --> 11:39.053
and let Jo be Jo.
Sound good?

11:39.777 --> 11:41.703
<i>No. Sounds great.</i>

11:41.753 --> 11:43.057
Why would you apologize?

11:43.148 --> 11:45.317
What the hell
is your problem?! Uhh!

11:47.385 --> 11:49.783
Ha ha. Reminds me of what
my grandpa taught me

11:49.875 --> 11:50.657
when I was a boy.

11:51.319 --> 11:54.079
He said, "Janitor, every time
an angry woman storms out...

11:54.190 --> 11:56.038
"Another angry woman
storms in."

11:56.098 --> 11:57.352
What?

11:58.144 --> 11:59.257
Get out of my way.

12:00.822 --> 12:02.769
Hmm. That one's for you,
pop-pop.

12:03.894 --> 12:06.793
He's not dead.
He's upstairs, dying.

12:10.026 --> 12:12.234
Excuse me.
Dr. Kelso, isn't it?

12:12.304 --> 12:13.398
I'm Jordan Sullivan.

12:13.438 --> 12:14.542
What are you doing?

12:14.582 --> 12:17.538
I'm introducing myself,
because clearly,

12:17.578 --> 12:20.601
anyone who would convince Perry
not to take the chief job

12:20.641 --> 12:21.797
has never met me.

12:21.877 --> 12:24.707
That pansy-ass little tattletale.

12:24.769 --> 12:28.251
Bob, so help me god,
you fix this,

12:28.322 --> 12:29.776
or I will grab you
by your muffin top

12:29.816 --> 12:31.523
and stomp
on your withering man parts

12:31.591 --> 12:32.648
until your eyes pop out.

12:32.737 --> 12:35.600
20 years ago, I would have
thrown you on this table

12:35.679 --> 12:37.184
and made love to you
right here.

12:37.264 --> 12:40.314
And I would have loved it!
(Bob and Jordan groans)

12:40.314 --> 12:42.170
See? That is
the kind of passion

12:42.210 --> 12:43.484
that I want tonight
with J.D.

12:43.563 --> 12:45.219
But we've hooked up
so much in the past,

12:45.291 --> 12:46.756
I can't come up
with anything new.

12:46.807 --> 12:49.595
Ooh, what if I dripped
hot candle wax on his chest?

12:49.686 --> 12:51.673
No, Tina Two-Kids tried it

12:51.734 --> 12:53.210
and burnt off
his treasure trail.

12:53.210 --> 12:55.427
Okay. Okay.
Let's just keep spitballing.

12:55.478 --> 12:57.244
What if I strangle him
a little?

12:57.305 --> 12:59.845
No. J.D. might like
the idea of that,

12:59.885 --> 13:02.613
but if he loses too much
oxygen, he'll get dizzy,

13:02.673 --> 13:05.042
and then his space needle
will become his space noodle.

13:05.093 --> 13:09.775
- How do you even know that?
- Elliot, I just do!

13:09.818 --> 13:11.372
Matter of fact, I don't wanna
talk about this anymore,

13:11.432 --> 13:14.112
- All right? I'm out.
- Angry woman out.

13:14.182 --> 13:15.436
Damn it!

13:20.172 --> 13:20.629
Angry woman in.

13:20.629 --> 13:23.987
You better not be making me one
of your stupid janitor jokes.

13:24.080 --> 13:25.385
No, ma'am.

13:27.120 --> 13:28.265
Angry woman out.

13:34.335 --> 13:34.996
(exhales deeply)

13:36.002 --> 13:37.015
Hey, I'm glad I found you.

13:37.125 --> 13:40.076
Uh, I need your approval
to cut down some lollipop trees

13:40.176 --> 13:42.916
- outside the sea-monkey hut.
- What are you talking about?

13:42.996 --> 13:44.852
These decisions
have to go through you

13:44.904 --> 13:48.778
- because you're the mayor of Crazy Town.
- Okay, I really don't need this right now.

13:48.848 --> 13:51.306
Okay, fine, but you're
supposed to be working,

13:51.357 --> 13:54.383
so would you mind checking
the patient in bed six for dementia?

13:54.454 --> 13:56.101
This is bed six.

13:56.169 --> 13:58.865
I know. I think you're crazy.
It was a twofer. Pa-pow!

13:58.915 --> 14:00.775
You're aware I could
kick your ass, right?

14:00.835 --> 14:02.722
I'm sure I'd get in some slaps.

14:02.773 --> 14:04.168
Look, I know I'm horrible
with patients,

14:04.228 --> 14:07.230
but I make one lucky call
with Mr. Lawton's endoscopy,

14:07.281 --> 14:09.029
and now you're not gonna
push me anymore to be better?

14:09.069 --> 14:10.876
Okay, you're not the
Mayor of Crazy Town.

14:10.926 --> 14:11.760
You're the emperor.

14:11.830 --> 14:13.997
At least when you gave me crap,
I knew you were trying to help,

14:14.059 --> 14:15.500
But now you're just
giving up on me?

14:15.541 --> 14:17.019
What do you care?
You don't even listen to me.

14:17.057 --> 14:18.764
What?
I've been busting my ass

14:18.804 --> 14:20.341
trying to be more caring
with the patients.

14:20.391 --> 14:22.308
Remember when Mr. Lawton
was uncomfortable?

14:24.567 --> 14:26.405
Oh, thank you, doctor.

14:28.144 --> 14:30.116
That must have been
so hard for you.

14:30.156 --> 14:31.923
Yeah, I'm still mad
thinking about it.

14:36.139 --> 14:38.067
- What's with the yarn?
- I'm gonna use it later.

14:38.126 --> 14:39.884
Oh, by the way,
Jordan thinks I'm hot.

14:39.957 --> 14:42.164
Yeah, she mentioned that before.
It's disturbing.

14:42.214 --> 14:43.729
Why aren't you
taking the job, Perry?

14:43.789 --> 14:45.195
You said it was
a bureaucratic nightmare.

14:45.255 --> 14:47.127
- And I don't want to be miserable.
- You love being miserable.

14:47.198 --> 14:49.255
- I don't want everyone to hate me.
- Everybody already hates you.

14:49.326 --> 14:51.712
You wanna know the real reason
why you don't want the gig, champ?

14:51.782 --> 14:55.074
- Because you're a fraidy-cat.
- Beg your pardon?

14:55.155 --> 14:57.664
Didn't you hear me?
Are fraidy-cat's ears too tiny?

14:57.734 --> 15:00.514
- Don't push me, Bob.
- You're right. I'm sorry.

15:00.604 --> 15:03.992
Would it make you feel any better
to bat this around for a while?

15:04.061 --> 15:05.615
(groans)

15:05.685 --> 15:10.283
See, I told you I was
gonna use it later.

15:10.353 --> 15:12.415
Do you know why
I got into medicine?

15:12.484 --> 15:14.951
I assumed there was
some sort of flyer

15:15.020 --> 15:16.372
outside football practice.

15:16.441 --> 15:19.486
(laughs sarcastically)
No.

15:19.545 --> 15:21.614
Look, I don't care
that I'm not that feminine.

15:21.693 --> 15:23.260
I still look rockin' hot
when I'm naked

15:23.320 --> 15:24.975
so I can get it
whenever I want it.

15:25.055 --> 15:27.433
- Okay, now that was feminine.
- Shut up.

15:27.503 --> 15:30.885
I became a doctor because I love
the nuts and bolts of it all.

15:30.953 --> 15:33.759
Like that woman over there--
I am fascinated

15:33.828 --> 15:36.269
by the way, her heart pumps
blood through her body

15:36.328 --> 15:38.547
like a machine,
the way her axons are covered

15:38.628 --> 15:41.498
in a thin layer of myelin like
an insulated electrical wire.

15:41.538 --> 15:44.197
But tell me
to empathize with her,

15:44.247 --> 15:46.835
to be totally open
and vulnerable? Ugh!

15:46.875 --> 15:49.884
No, I-I can't even do that
with my own family,

15:49.975 --> 15:51.452
let alone a total stranger.

15:51.520 --> 15:54.665
I'm not sure
I can get past that.

15:54.733 --> 15:57.202
What makes you think
you're so special?

15:57.270 --> 16:00.246
Every doctor in this place has
flaws they've been dealing with

16:00.315 --> 16:04.530
since they were a little kid.
Hell, the guy who taught me

16:04.530 --> 16:06.335
is constantly getting
in his own way.

16:06.404 --> 16:08.703
Ah, who needs
a promotion anyway?

16:08.771 --> 16:11.951
I'm dating a girl who's always
fighting her own neurosis.

16:12.020 --> 16:13.338
(knocks on window)

16:13.406 --> 16:15.976
Come on, Turk!
Talk to me!

16:16.044 --> 16:19.257
And you saw my biggest flaw
in action today.

16:19.326 --> 16:23.789
I was willing to let a patient
I liked go without an endoscopy

16:23.858 --> 16:27.240
because I wanted to spare him
a painful procedure.

16:27.308 --> 16:29.371
Sometimes I care
a little too much.

16:29.439 --> 16:32.314
Yeah, but that caring thing
has a major upside.

16:32.382 --> 16:35.460
And so does
your cold bitchy thing.

16:35.529 --> 16:39.012
It'll protect you from letting
all this stuff weigh you down.

16:39.081 --> 16:40.940
Remember last Monday?

16:41.009 --> 16:43.071
We spent that night
watching a young father

16:43.140 --> 16:46.555
die of lung cancer.
Do you remember his name?

16:46.555 --> 16:47.706
No, um,
not even a little bit.

16:47.774 --> 16:50.514
Jack Freemont.

16:50.582 --> 16:53.471
Sometimes I still think
about him,

16:53.471 --> 16:56.220
and that is not a good thing.

16:56.298 --> 16:58.456
(Jo chuckles)
What?

16:58.517 --> 17:00.815
You're so in touch
with your emotions,

17:00.884 --> 17:02.160
and I can't really
get to mine.

17:02.200 --> 17:04.536
It's kinda like I'm the dude
and you're the chick.

17:04.585 --> 17:07.925
I'm not really getting
that simile, Jo,

17:07.925 --> 17:10.368
but if it works for you,
awesome.

17:10.438 --> 17:13.786
So now we know what my deal is.
How you gonna fix it?

17:13.855 --> 17:16.829
I'm not gonna fix anything.
I got my own garbage.

17:16.898 --> 17:19.740
You're gonna do this
on your own.

17:19.808 --> 17:22.167
You're a doctor.

17:24.137 --> 17:27.808
(monitor beeping steadily)
Turk, come on. I'm desperate.

17:27.858 --> 17:29.814
Elliot, Todd and I
are in the middle

17:29.875 --> 17:32.042
of teaching our interns
how to do an appendectomy.

17:32.093 --> 17:34.519
Oh, please, you just cut it out
and sew him up.

17:34.589 --> 17:37.009
She's right, actually.
Finish up.

17:37.080 --> 17:40.372
Look, Carla always says that
making love with you is perfect.

17:40.443 --> 17:42.269
(chuckles)
Yeah, she did.

17:42.329 --> 17:43.317
Tell me what makes it
so special.

17:43.386 --> 17:47.241
I mean, she says
that you even cry sometimes.

17:49.181 --> 17:50.126
Thank you for sharing.

17:50.225 --> 17:51.872
That's okay, T-Dog.

17:51.963 --> 17:53.717
If it doesn't hurt,
you're not doing it right.

17:53.776 --> 17:57.051
I just want things to be
different with J.D this time,

17:57.119 --> 17:58.118
to be better.

17:58.179 --> 18:01.063
You wanna know what's so special
about Carla and I?

18:00.130 --> 18:03.512
That we don't have to try
and make it special. Okay?

18:03.580 --> 18:06.421
We're just connected. If you
want things to be different

18:06.490 --> 18:08.821
with J.D this time around,
you're gonna have to give up

18:09.000 --> 18:11.258
all of that immature,
neurotic over-thinking

18:11.328 --> 18:15.126
and just be with each other.
Todd, hit the button.

18:15.206 --> 18:16.501
What button?

18:16.571 --> 18:19.230
(light switch clicks)

18:19.339 --> 18:20.343
Much better.

18:20.414 --> 18:21.510
(pounding on window)
(Elliot) Turk!

18:21.570 --> 18:23.436
Oh! That's not right.

18:24.599 --> 18:26.986
So this is what fear
feels like, huh?

18:29.848 --> 18:31.423
It's kinda like
being really drunk,

18:31.473 --> 18:34.544
only...
in a very sad way.

18:34.585 --> 18:38.257
You're just loving watching me
fall apart like this, huh?

18:38.307 --> 18:42.490
More than comfy shoes
and a warm place to crap.

18:42.561 --> 18:45.270
- Yeah.
- But you're gonna take this job.

18:45.379 --> 18:48.033
Partly because
you were meant to do it,

18:48.082 --> 18:50.921
but mostly because if you don't,
I will always remind you

18:50.972 --> 18:52.960
that you are
a sac-less little fraidy-cat.

18:53.010 --> 18:55.235
Why in the hell did you try
to talk me out of it?

18:55.306 --> 18:57.734
I had to tell you the truth
to prepare you.

18:57.765 --> 19:00.364
If I'd fluffed it up, you would
have tortured me forever.

19:00.394 --> 19:04.177
So you really think
I'm the man for the job?

19:06.174 --> 19:08.085
Who the hell do you think
recommended you?

19:09.050 --> 19:10.820
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

19:10.869 --> 19:12.827
[Song: I'd Rather Be With You
Artist: Joshua Radin]

19:12.926 --> 19:15.025
- Oh, God, no.
- What?

19:15.055 --> 19:17.526
You don't really think
we're becoming friends, do you?

19:17.594 --> 19:20.668
Good Lord. I hope not.

19:20.738 --> 19:22.182
(groans)

19:22.243 --> 19:24.731
You wanna come over
for a brewski tomorrow

19:24.820 --> 19:25.775
and check out
my hobby shop?

19:25.775 --> 19:28.455
- Too fast, Bob.
- Yeah, I knew when I said it.

19:31.326 --> 19:33.083
Oh, good. You're done
with your quiet time.

19:33.142 --> 19:34.787
Look, the nurse said
that Mr. Lawton's having

19:34.827 --> 19:36.433
A bit of a breakdown
about his cancer.

19:37.059 --> 19:38.961
I want you to go over there
and help him through it.

19:39.022 --> 19:40.447
You really want me
talking to him?

19:40.496 --> 19:43.196
- If he cries, I'm gonna hit him.
- Don't mess it up.

19:43.257 --> 19:44.825
Okay.

19:45.714 --> 19:47.191
<i>I knew I couldn't fix Jo,</i>

19:47.290 --> 19:48.604
<i>but I could still
give her a push...</i>

19:48.684 --> 19:50.879
<i>Because sometimes
that's all people need</i>

19:50.948 --> 19:52.943
<i>to deal with their fatal flaw</i>

19:57.048 --> 19:59.107
Well, I'm the new chief.

20:00.541 --> 20:01.876
Ohh!

20:04.005 --> 20:07.252
Uh... What the hell
is happening?

20:07.320 --> 20:08.774
Still too soon?

20:08.842 --> 20:11.142
Way too soon, Bob.

20:11.211 --> 20:14.187
<i>And even if some people
can only take a baby step...</i>

20:14.255 --> 20:16.723
I can't imagine
what it's like to have cancer,

20:16.792 --> 20:20.309
but I bet it sucks.

20:20.377 --> 20:22.809
It totally sucks.

20:29.037 --> 20:31.236
- You all right?
- Yeah, I'll get through.

20:33.299 --> 20:36.275
<i>Others might finally be able
to stop trying so hard</i>

20:36.344 --> 20:38.339
<i>and just let the moment happen.</i>

20:38.407 --> 20:41.579
Wow. You look amazing.

20:43.827 --> 20:45.645
Even in cookie pants?

20:45.714 --> 20:48.507
Especially in cookie pants.

20:55.102 --> 20:56.588
(beep)
That one's for you, pop-pop.

20:57.411 --> 21:00.912
He's not dead.
He's upstairs... Dying.

21:01.011 --> 21:03.461
<i>(J.D) Is he a patient here?</i>

21:03.572 --> 21:06.492
Yeah. He's in the psych ward.
He says he's an owl, but...

21:06.562 --> 21:09.087
(chuckles)
You can't believe a word he hoots.

21:09.156 --> 21:11.151
(beep)
That one's for you, grandpa.

21:11.219 --> 21:13.539
He's not dead.
He's on the roof.

21:13.601 --> 21:16.078
<i>(J.D) Why on the roof?</i>

21:16.168 --> 21:19.033
He thinks he's a mountain lion.

21:19.101 --> 21:20.182
(beep)
Just like my granddad taught me

21:20.230 --> 21:21.361
when I was a boy.

21:21.484 --> 21:23.467
He said,
"Janitor, don't marry a German.

21:23.518 --> 21:24.703
"They have monkey feet."
