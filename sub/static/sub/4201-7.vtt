00:00.078 --> 00:01.245
Previously on Chasing Life

00:01.258 --> 00:03.525
- What do you think?
- I'm so madly in love with you.

00:03.527 --> 00:05.261
How are you dealing with so much change?

00:05.263 --> 00:06.428
Does this answer your question?

00:06.430 --> 00:08.597
If you ever need me, I'm here for you.

00:08.599 --> 00:10.065
Thank you, George.

00:10.067 --> 00:11.632
I'm sorry, an asset for?

00:11.634 --> 00:14.102
A new philanthropic element to our company.

00:14.104 --> 00:15.603
I'd be proud to have you on our team.

00:15.605 --> 00:17.205
I couldn't stop thinking about your dad.

00:17.207 --> 00:20.008
Natalie found a manuscript
for a book he was working on.

00:20.010 --> 00:21.542
(All gasping)

00:21.544 --> 00:23.577
<i>Dr. Hamburg:  You've been under
an exceptional amount of stress.</i>

00:23.579 --> 00:24.846
<i>You'll have to take it every easy.</i>

00:24.848 --> 00:26.181
Our honeymoon's next week.

00:26.183 --> 00:27.782
You can't travel, not in this condition.

00:27.784 --> 00:29.416
So what's the next step?

00:37.578 --> 00:39.712
- Hey, honey?
- Hey!

00:39.714 --> 00:41.114
You ever seen the show <i>"Hoarders"</i> ?

00:41.116 --> 00:42.148
No.

00:42.150 --> 00:45.751
Yeah, you have. We live in it.

00:45.753 --> 00:48.888
Maybe we've been a little lazy
about cleaning up this past month,

00:48.890 --> 00:49.922
but we just moved in.

00:49.924 --> 00:52.091
We're still in our honeymoon phase.

00:53.101 --> 00:55.603
Which I love. I love.

00:55.628 --> 00:58.729
Especially because we got
robbed of an actual honeymoon.

00:58.754 --> 01:01.654
But it's time for our next phase.

01:02.000 --> 01:04.867
Like making the dining room
table a functional place to eat.

01:04.891 --> 01:08.164
Oh, hang on though, because that
is my favorite spot to stack things.

01:08.197 --> 01:09.630
Yeah? Even more than the sink?

01:10.406 --> 01:11.539
Maybe we should get a housekeeper?

01:11.541 --> 01:12.974
No, we don't need a housekeeper.

01:12.976 --> 01:14.476
We just need to figure out a better system.

01:14.478 --> 01:15.910
I like it when you say "system."

01:15.912 --> 01:17.644
I'm serious.

01:17.646 --> 01:19.213
Back at home, we took
turns with the chores.

01:19.215 --> 01:21.281
You know, Brenna and I would
alternate nights doing everything.

01:21.283 --> 01:23.484
Brenna's covering you for your
transfusion this morning, right?

01:23.486 --> 01:24.618
No, Beth.

01:24.620 --> 01:26.586
And Uncle George is flying in on a red-eye,

01:26.588 --> 01:28.855
to check out my genome
test results this afternoon.

01:28.857 --> 01:30.824
Try not to be jealous of my
wicked fun day at Mass Medical.

01:30.826 --> 01:32.626
I'm just sorry I can't go with you.

01:32.628 --> 01:35.289
I know what it's like to have
a job you're passionate about,

01:35.314 --> 01:36.648
and I am proud of you.

01:36.797 --> 01:39.064
I know you never imagined
working for your dad's company,

01:39.066 --> 01:40.632
but this job couldn't be more you.

01:40.634 --> 01:44.302
Well, thank you, but I don't want my
job to mean that everything falls on you.

01:44.304 --> 01:47.072
Let's figure out a system, okay?

01:49.189 --> 01:50.422
How do you make a system?

01:51.613 --> 01:52.948
We divide and conquer.

01:52.973 --> 01:54.172
Okay.

01:54.197 --> 01:55.363
I'll start the dishes,

01:55.388 --> 01:58.455
and you take out this overflowing trash.

01:58.630 --> 01:59.765
Deal!

01:59.790 --> 02:02.124
And maybe you can start
figuring out what's for dinner.

02:02.149 --> 02:03.548
Oh, but I like when you decide.

02:03.573 --> 02:04.750
Can we take turns, at least?

02:04.775 --> 02:07.208
All right, well, you start
tonight, I have a headache.

02:07.289 --> 02:08.710
I have cancer.

02:09.211 --> 02:11.278
Did April Carver just play her cancer card?

02:11.451 --> 02:12.717
- I did.
- (Whistles)

02:12.844 --> 02:14.710
Unbelievable.

02:14.915 --> 02:15.915
Ew!

02:16.740 --> 02:17.908
What's in here?

02:17.933 --> 02:20.934
<i>♪ You bet your soul, honey</i>

02:20.959 --> 02:23.359
<i>♪ you bet your soul</i>

02:23.384 --> 02:26.452
<i>♪ just right</i>

02:28.266 --> 02:32.302
<i>♪ you could stay all night
and never wanna go home ♪</i>

02:35.118 --> 02:36.625
<i>♪ 'cause we can't stop, we won't stop ♪</i>

02:40.394 --> 02:41.560
I don't know how you do it,

02:41.602 --> 02:43.102
blood transfusions twice a week.

02:43.104 --> 02:45.571
Mmm, more like four times these days.

02:45.573 --> 02:47.974
Just... it really helps.
I've been so worn out,

02:47.976 --> 02:49.308
'cause I'm in-between treatments.

02:49.310 --> 02:51.510
But I get my genome results today.

02:51.512 --> 02:53.179
Oh! Translation, please?

02:53.181 --> 02:55.381
Hopefully it'll tell me which
clinical trial I can do next.

02:55.882 --> 02:56.981
Carver.

02:57.850 --> 02:59.417
So how's wife-life?

02:59.419 --> 03:03.188
It's good. Still working out
the kinks of living together.

03:03.190 --> 03:04.890
I've never even lived
with a boyfriend before.

03:04.892 --> 03:06.858
Yeah, and now you have a husband.

03:06.860 --> 03:09.194
I still can't believe it.

03:09.196 --> 03:12.898
I can't believe you hooked up
with Graham in this very hospital.

03:12.900 --> 03:16.000
Your health scare affected us
all in very different ways, April,

03:16.002 --> 03:18.135
but, as a wise philosopher once said,

03:18.137 --> 03:20.805
"we are never, ever getting back together."

03:20.807 --> 03:22.773
But like, never, ever?

03:24.419 --> 03:27.221
Sorry, that guy in the
suit keeps staring at me.

03:29.915 --> 03:31.782
Ugh, he's a pharmaceutical rep.

03:31.784 --> 03:34.884
They're like the car salesmen of
the hospital, but they sell meds.

03:34.886 --> 03:36.752
Ugh!

03:36.754 --> 03:38.788
And great, he's coming over here.

03:38.790 --> 03:40.489
I predict he's gonna lead with a "heya."

03:40.491 --> 03:43.092
- Hey there, ladies.
- Close enough.

03:43.094 --> 03:46.529
Well, you definitely got my vote for
"best dressed in the oncology ward."

03:46.531 --> 03:48.921
Oh, thanks. That's a nice suit...

03:50.499 --> 03:51.766
Pharkas.

03:51.768 --> 03:53.335
I'm just gonna leave this here.

03:53.337 --> 03:54.657
I'd love to take you out some time.

03:55.705 --> 03:57.405
Okay, thanks.

03:57.407 --> 03:58.707
What was your name?

03:58.709 --> 04:01.076
Just, you know, so I know it when you call.

04:01.078 --> 04:03.578
Um, Beth.

04:03.580 --> 04:04.847
This is April.

04:04.849 --> 04:06.747
Beth, April.

04:06.827 --> 04:08.727
Pharkas.

04:08.752 --> 04:10.185
Josh.

04:15.523 --> 04:16.557
No.

04:27.453 --> 04:30.568
Hey! What ever happened with
that film festival you entered?

04:30.593 --> 04:32.605
Um, I didn't get in.

04:32.778 --> 04:34.211
Thanks for reminding me.

04:38.946 --> 04:39.979
(Knock on door)

04:39.981 --> 04:42.447
Anybody home? Oh, hey! Hey! Hey!

04:42.449 --> 04:44.683
- Hey, you're back!
- Yay!

04:44.685 --> 04:45.751
Hey.

04:45.753 --> 04:47.953
It's been so lonely here
without April and grandma.

04:47.955 --> 04:50.589
Yeah, aw! So how's public
school treating you, kid?

04:50.591 --> 04:52.830
They didn't have a film
club, so I joined this

04:52.855 --> 04:54.927
gay and lesbian club a
couple of weeks ago,

04:54.929 --> 04:57.061
- to meet some new friends.
- You did?

04:57.063 --> 04:58.462
You never mentioned that.

04:58.464 --> 04:59.585
Yeah.

04:59.799 --> 05:02.066
Well, um, anyway,

05:02.068 --> 05:03.768
- I'll see you guys later.
- Okay.

05:03.770 --> 05:04.835
Bye.

05:07.039 --> 05:10.904
I just got more information hearing
her talk to you for 30 seconds,

05:10.929 --> 05:12.904
than I have in a month alone with her.

05:12.929 --> 05:15.145
- Oh, well. Hey!
- Hey!

05:15.147 --> 05:18.048
All right, look, make yourself at
home. Mom's room is made up for you.

05:18.050 --> 05:19.449
The coffee is hot.
(Cell phone ringing)

05:19.451 --> 05:21.836
- And...
- I'm sorry, one second.

05:21.861 --> 05:24.495
- Oh! Can I?
- Okay. No, go.

05:25.487 --> 05:27.221
Hey, yeah, I was just about to call you.

05:28.668 --> 05:29.801
Well, I just landed.

05:30.968 --> 05:32.226
Well, you know,

05:32.259 --> 05:35.260
screaming babies on all
sides, just the way I like it.

05:35.285 --> 05:37.866
Huh! Okay, Mae, can I call you in a few?

05:39.436 --> 05:40.502
I love you, too.

05:50.115 --> 05:51.449
This isn't weird for you, is it?

05:52.453 --> 05:53.919
- I'm sorry?
- Well, I mean,

05:53.921 --> 05:56.088
when Mae and I were here for the wedding,

05:56.090 --> 05:58.991
things felt a little awkward
when it was just the three of us,

05:58.993 --> 06:00.526
and I just want to make sure you're okay.

06:00.528 --> 06:02.895
No, that's really sweet
of you, but I'm fine.

06:04.000 --> 06:06.698
In fact, I've been keeping really busy,

06:06.700 --> 06:09.735
with work and this running
group that I joined.

06:09.737 --> 06:12.234
Actually, you know, William and I
reconnected. You remember William?

06:12.259 --> 06:15.710
He would've been Billy when
you met him back in the day.

06:15.742 --> 06:18.510
Anyway, he and I have been
seeing a lot of each other lately.

06:18.512 --> 06:20.195
Mmm. Mmm. Your high
school boyfriend, Billy?

06:20.220 --> 06:21.352
That's the one.

06:21.377 --> 06:22.576
Ah!

06:22.601 --> 06:24.334
You guys are dating again?

06:26.203 --> 06:27.718
Yeah!

06:27.743 --> 06:29.876
- How great! That's great!
- Yeah!

06:32.323 --> 06:33.589
All right, I'm gonna...

06:34.798 --> 06:35.965
Wash my face.

06:36.911 --> 06:39.011
- Hey, don't pour that out.
- Okay.

06:41.374 --> 06:43.546
Well, if you're trying

06:43.594 --> 06:47.030
to set a record for most bad news delivered
to one patient, you're doing great.

06:47.032 --> 06:50.699
I know it's frustrating, but, believe
me, it could be a whole lot worse.

06:50.701 --> 06:54.369
There's a drug that could cure
me, and I'm not allowed to take it.

06:54.371 --> 06:55.603
That's pretty bad.

06:55.605 --> 06:57.805
Well, that's the nature
of these clinical trials.

06:57.807 --> 07:00.942
There's a very formal process for
medications to be approved for diseases,

07:00.944 --> 07:04.054
and this has only been approved
for pancreatic cancer so far.

07:04.079 --> 07:05.695
What's so special about the pancreas?

07:05.711 --> 07:08.845
Look, these trials come along
all the time. Just sit tight.

07:08.847 --> 07:11.714
My symptoms are just
starting to wear on me.

07:11.716 --> 07:13.570
You know, I'm anxious to start something.

07:13.594 --> 07:14.926
I've only written one chapter of my book

07:14.928 --> 07:17.962
because I'm so foggy and tired.

07:17.964 --> 07:19.898
I just... I can't focus on anything.

07:19.900 --> 07:21.266
Any tips, George?

07:21.268 --> 07:23.334
Well, my methods for children
are different than for adults,

07:23.336 --> 07:24.898
but some of them might translate.

07:24.923 --> 07:28.123
So why don't you stop by the house
tomorrow? We'll work something out.

07:28.148 --> 07:29.615
Okay.

07:31.516 --> 07:35.285
<i>If there was a Bruce Jenner or a show
like "Transparent" on TV 10 years ago,</i>

07:35.287 --> 07:38.155
I would have started my
transition a long time ago.

07:38.157 --> 07:41.625
But, growing up in Florida,
there was no support for me.

07:41.627 --> 07:43.460
No LGBTQ club...

07:43.462 --> 07:45.528
A-I.

07:45.530 --> 07:46.696
Sorry, Jerry.

07:46.698 --> 07:48.597
LGBTQAI.

07:48.599 --> 07:52.902
Of course, asexual and inter-sex
students are not forgotten here.

07:52.904 --> 07:56.734
<i>Why couldn't they find a transgender
actor to play the lead in Transparent?</i>

07:56.820 --> 08:00.078
<i>Whatever. Gwynnie played a
guy in  Shakespeare in love.</i>

08:00.148 --> 08:03.679
Oh, honey, that was drag, not trans.

08:03.704 --> 08:06.141
But before we break for the day,
I thought we could spend some time

08:06.143 --> 08:08.143
getting to know more
about our newest member.

08:08.145 --> 08:10.296
- Hi, Brenna!
- Hi.

08:10.321 --> 08:13.489
On behalf of the club, we're
so glad to have our first "B".

08:14.343 --> 08:15.695
Wait. You're bi?

08:16.468 --> 08:18.609
Oh. I thought you were gay.

08:18.641 --> 08:19.875
Yeah, I did, too.

08:19.877 --> 08:21.742
But I see it now. That's sexy.

08:21.773 --> 08:23.372
I could never be with a bi girl.

08:23.374 --> 08:24.808
You know, you have to be pretty secure,

08:24.810 --> 08:27.043
to be with someone who's
attracted to the entire population.

08:27.045 --> 08:31.547
Oh, my god, Mariah. It's not
like I'm into everyone I walk by.

08:31.549 --> 08:34.445
So, is your guy type really feminine?

08:34.470 --> 08:37.169
Oh. Babe, you don't get it.

08:38.176 --> 08:40.879
The bisexual thing is so tricky though.

08:40.904 --> 08:43.804
'Cause if you can change your mind
every day about who you're attracted to,

08:43.828 --> 08:46.564
it makes it sound like
being gay is also a choice.

08:46.589 --> 08:49.492
Okay. It's not "changing
my mind." I'm just...

08:49.836 --> 08:53.234
Attracted to the person for
who they are, not their gender.

08:53.259 --> 08:56.437
(Sighs) That's exactly what my ex
said before leaving me for a dude.

08:56.453 --> 08:59.854
My theory? Bi guys are actually
gay. Bi girls are straight.

08:59.856 --> 09:01.789
But I'm not straight.

09:01.791 --> 09:04.092
I mean, the last two
people I dated are girls.

09:04.094 --> 09:05.393
So maybe you're just gay.

09:05.395 --> 09:06.928
(School bell ringing)

09:06.930 --> 09:10.597
There's obviously a lot more
to discuss about bisexuality...

09:10.599 --> 09:12.766
And asexuality.

09:12.768 --> 09:14.585
Yes, Jerry. That, too.

09:14.610 --> 09:17.111
So we'll pick back up on this next time.

09:17.136 --> 09:18.468
Have a good rest of your day.

09:21.888 --> 09:24.189
I have dinner!

09:24.214 --> 09:25.479
(Sighs)

09:28.162 --> 09:29.897
Oh! don't be sad.

09:29.922 --> 09:31.087
We have a system.

09:31.112 --> 09:33.648
And I got you a beautiful sub

09:33.992 --> 09:35.851
made by a sandwich artist

09:36.761 --> 09:38.061
named Julio.

09:38.063 --> 09:39.263
Thank you.

09:40.375 --> 09:41.508
Are you okay?

09:41.510 --> 09:44.311
Yeah, it's nothing new.
I just... I feel useless.

09:44.313 --> 09:46.679
I can't go anywhere or do anything.

09:46.681 --> 09:50.083
And I hate that you
have to see me like this.

09:50.085 --> 09:52.152
I wish I could go into
another room and cry,

09:52.154 --> 09:54.521
but this apartment is just one big room.

09:54.523 --> 09:56.123
Okay, okay, okay.

09:56.125 --> 09:57.956
(Shushing)

09:59.437 --> 10:02.428
Why don't you just relax?

10:02.430 --> 10:04.210
Stop cleaning, I've got it.

10:04.235 --> 10:06.368
-Okay?
-But the system says it's my turn.

10:06.393 --> 10:07.659
Screw the system.

10:12.411 --> 10:13.777
- Thank you.
- Go relax.

10:15.796 --> 10:18.835
Maybe I can finally make
a dent in chapter two.

10:18.860 --> 10:22.962
Ooh! Is it going to be called "what it's
like having the world's greatest husband"?

10:23.952 --> 10:24.985
Just a suggestion.

10:25.237 --> 10:26.403
Mind if I turn on the TV?

10:27.265 --> 10:29.031
- Sure.
- Yeah?

10:29.056 --> 10:30.189
<i>News anchor: And in other news... </i>

10:30.214 --> 10:32.580
(commentator chatting)

10:32.605 --> 10:34.405
Ooh, yes.

10:40.188 --> 10:41.654
Come on, come on, come on.

10:41.679 --> 10:44.313
I'm sorry, could you just...
Could you just turn it down?

10:44.315 --> 10:46.216
Oh! Yeah, yeah, yeah. Sure, sure.

10:46.218 --> 10:47.716
I'm sorry, is that annoying?

10:47.718 --> 10:49.317
No, not at all.

10:49.319 --> 10:50.819
(Volume reducing)

10:54.137 --> 10:55.704
(Volume reducing)

11:02.268 --> 11:03.302
(Clears throat)

11:04.336 --> 11:05.936
- Okay, you know what?
- I'm sorry.

11:05.938 --> 11:07.838
- That's it.
- I haven't made any progress,

11:07.840 --> 11:09.707
and if I want to bring it to someone...

11:09.709 --> 11:11.842
This apartment has been fine for me,

11:11.844 --> 11:13.777
but it obviously doesn't
work for the two of us,

11:13.779 --> 11:16.280
so it's not just a new system we need.

11:16.282 --> 11:17.748
We need a new place.

11:23.085 --> 11:24.887
Chapter two,

11:24.889 --> 11:27.357
"what it's like having the
world's greatest husband."

11:28.524 --> 11:29.690
Yes!

11:31.758 --> 11:34.295
Hmm, what financial problems?

11:34.320 --> 11:37.592
Stop it. I mean, half of
this stuff was on sale,

11:37.617 --> 11:40.288
and... you know, why
am I rationalizing this?

11:40.313 --> 11:42.213
I'm doing a little something for me.

11:42.215 --> 11:43.681
- Well, you deserve it.
- Yeah.

11:43.683 --> 11:46.217
Training for a 10k requires me

11:46.219 --> 11:49.586
to buy cute running clothes to motivate me.

11:49.588 --> 11:51.688
So there, I said it.

11:51.690 --> 11:53.590
So what's up with the big move?

11:53.592 --> 11:55.325
What neighborhoods are you
guys looking at, anyway?

11:55.327 --> 11:59.204
I hear Beacon Hill is lovely.

11:59.228 --> 12:01.421
I honestly don't care where we live,

12:01.446 --> 12:04.093
-as long as I get some privacy.
-Yeah.

12:04.118 --> 12:05.820
When I was at home, at least I had a door

12:05.845 --> 12:07.644
I could close and disappear behind

12:07.669 --> 12:09.742
when you guys drove me crazy.

12:09.758 --> 12:11.858
It's different with a romantic partner.

12:11.860 --> 12:15.445
You guys fighting about whose
turn it is to do the dishes?

12:15.623 --> 12:19.158
No, we're fighting about whose
turn it is to do everything,

12:19.183 --> 12:20.582
mostly dinner.

12:20.607 --> 12:23.340
Well, you know, you're always
welcome to come over for dinner.

12:23.365 --> 12:24.631
I'm doing Indian tomorrow.

12:24.656 --> 12:26.078
Oh, yes, please.

12:26.094 --> 12:27.894
I'm meeting Leo's coworkers for happy hour.

12:27.919 --> 12:31.721
So odd to say, "Leo's coworkers."

12:31.723 --> 12:33.823
Yeah! Good for him.

12:33.825 --> 12:36.893
And it sounds like everything
you guys are experiencing

12:36.895 --> 12:38.648
is really normal, too.

12:38.656 --> 12:41.432
You know, especially since you
went from a new relationship

12:41.434 --> 12:43.601
to marriage and living together...

12:43.625 --> 12:45.124
Yeah, for a spontaneous wedding,

12:45.126 --> 12:47.827
we really ended up being old-fashioned.

12:47.829 --> 12:50.597
Not living together till we were legal.

12:50.599 --> 12:53.666
God! How did people do this in the '50s?

12:53.668 --> 12:56.168
Why are you asking me like I was there?

12:59.872 --> 13:02.173
Brenna: Oh, my god, I cannot
deal with them right now.

13:02.175 --> 13:04.776
What? Andrew and Mariah? I
thought you guys were friends.

13:04.778 --> 13:08.480
Well, we are, but they were
giving me so much crap yesterday

13:08.482 --> 13:10.046
in our meeting for being bi.

13:10.109 --> 13:11.375
But that doesn't make any sense.

13:11.377 --> 13:12.943
I thought the whole point
of that club was to...

13:12.945 --> 13:15.811
To support each other. Yeah, I
know, that's what I thought, too.

13:15.813 --> 13:17.513
Sorry I wasn't there to back you up.

13:17.515 --> 13:18.982
Oh!

13:18.984 --> 13:22.085
The one-legged/bi alliance

13:22.087 --> 13:24.053
really would have showed them who's boss.

13:24.032 --> 13:26.382
Hey, this thing's made of
metal. Y'all best be steppin'.

13:26.391 --> 13:28.925
So what's the deal on
the face mask these days?

13:28.926 --> 13:30.391
Just in big crowds?

13:30.394 --> 13:33.187
Yeah, so I'm pushing it
here, but if anyone sneezes...

13:33.336 --> 13:36.170
Hey, Finn. What's up, Brenna?

13:36.195 --> 13:38.095
Just you guys ganging up on her.

13:38.120 --> 13:40.621
Okay, I was only speaking
from personal experience.

13:40.646 --> 13:42.646
If she's really bi, she shouldn't
be so defensive about it.

13:42.807 --> 13:45.015
Andrew: Yeah, and my
theory is just a theory.

13:45.244 --> 13:47.312
I mean, so far it hasn't been wrong, but...

13:47.337 --> 13:49.237
- Well, it is now.
- Is it?

13:49.262 --> 13:51.128
You two seem pretty close lately.

13:51.153 --> 13:52.328
Are you together?

13:52.484 --> 13:54.350
Ugh, she's pulling an Amber Heard.

13:54.352 --> 13:56.286
No, we're not together.

13:56.288 --> 13:59.122
And why is the straight guy the
only person defending the bi girl?

13:59.124 --> 14:01.024
Finn, you don't have to defend me.

14:01.026 --> 14:03.159
Of course he's defending
you. Because you're together.

14:03.161 --> 14:04.626
(Sighs) I bet she'll
never go back to girls.

14:04.628 --> 14:06.495
God, drop it.

14:06.497 --> 14:08.063
We're not dating.

14:08.065 --> 14:11.000
Look, she's still into girls.
Trust me, I saw it with my own eyes.

14:11.002 --> 14:12.843
Typical straight girl tactic,

14:12.868 --> 14:15.301
making out with a girl in front of a dude.

14:15.326 --> 14:17.796
You guys don't know what
you're talking about, okay?

14:17.821 --> 14:20.153
If I were gonna date a
guy, it wouldn't be Finn.

14:20.178 --> 14:23.747
I'm not into him like that, like, at all.

14:24.167 --> 14:25.432
(School bell ringing)

14:29.079 --> 14:30.579
(Video game sounds)

14:30.963 --> 14:35.198
George: Yeah. Go! I can see you
focus. It's definitely improving.

14:35.223 --> 14:36.956
I hope you carry pepper spray,

14:36.981 --> 14:39.671
'cause if you are ever in a real
street fight, you are so screwed!

14:39.696 --> 14:41.530
Okay. Your attitude, however...

14:41.555 --> 14:42.546
Sorry.

14:42.571 --> 14:45.538
Okay, so I've got some information
about that clinical trial.

14:45.563 --> 14:48.231
Let me guess. It's
available for toe cancer now.

14:48.256 --> 14:53.258
Well, actually, it'll be available
for AML in the next few weeks.

14:55.724 --> 14:57.929
If you're trying to trick me into
losing. That is seriously messed up.

14:57.945 --> 14:59.612
No, I'm serious. I'm serious.

14:59.614 --> 15:03.416
But these clinical trials
can be very competitive.

15:03.418 --> 15:08.354
I'm seeing if I know anyone at Pharkas
who might be able to pull a few strings.

15:08.356 --> 15:09.140
Pharkas?

15:09.165 --> 15:11.490
Yeah, it's the company
that manufactures the drug.

15:11.492 --> 15:13.592
- April: Whoa!
- George: Bye-bye.

15:15.768 --> 15:17.335
- (Sighs) Again.
- Again.

15:19.195 --> 15:20.863
So, I've been meaning to ask you...

15:22.297 --> 15:24.531
Can I read that book that
you were telling me about?

15:26.033 --> 15:27.801
- Sure.
- Great.

15:27.803 --> 15:29.248
I mean, I still have
so many questions about

15:29.272 --> 15:31.234
what was going on with dad, his last year,

15:31.235 --> 15:33.335
like, mentally.

15:33.451 --> 15:35.785
You knew him better than anyone else.

15:35.810 --> 15:38.077
Was something happening with him?

15:38.102 --> 15:40.903
Uh, you know... Wait, pause here.

15:40.928 --> 15:42.027
Um...

15:43.063 --> 15:46.566
I mean, he might've been having
some issues with Olivia at the time.

15:47.919 --> 15:49.359
Like what?

15:50.272 --> 15:52.238
Um, I think she wanted more from him,

15:52.240 --> 15:54.006
even though the affair was stopped.

15:56.243 --> 15:58.645
There were feelings on
her side that continued.

15:59.556 --> 16:01.257
- You know?
- Wow.

16:03.834 --> 16:05.535
- (Sighs)
- All right, let's go.

16:07.161 --> 16:10.462
- And... what?
- I mean,

16:10.487 --> 16:12.221
-are you playing, like, inverted?
-No! No!

16:12.246 --> 16:13.578
'Cause you're doing everything wrong.

16:13.603 --> 16:14.923
Oh, no, no. I know what I'm doing.

16:16.906 --> 16:19.106
I never would have guessed you
keep your place this clean, Leo.

16:19.108 --> 16:22.076
- Oh!
- You should see his office.

16:22.078 --> 16:23.878
-Well, we got a housekeeper.
-There it is.

16:23.880 --> 16:26.180
And who made this
spinach and artichoke dip?

16:26.182 --> 16:26.866
That was...

16:26.891 --> 16:28.917
I bought that from Trader
Joe's frozen section.

16:28.919 --> 16:29.678
Don't tell them.

16:29.703 --> 16:31.953
You always like frozen
food better than mine.

16:31.955 --> 16:33.921
Nate has the palate of a five year old.

16:33.923 --> 16:36.990
I can't help it that I like
chicken nuggets. They're delicious.

16:36.992 --> 16:38.959
- There's no shame in that.
- Thank you.

16:38.961 --> 16:40.928
We've been crazy since we moved in,

16:40.930 --> 16:43.351
so the microwave has been our friend.

16:43.376 --> 16:44.937
Well, you've been working your asses off.

16:44.962 --> 16:47.262
I know that because Ruthie is
super behind on <i>"Dance Moms"</i>.

16:47.289 --> 16:49.455
Which kills me. Yes.

16:49.457 --> 16:51.657
But it's worth it, working
for a guy like this.

16:51.659 --> 16:55.461
And that camp for children with
terminal illnesses looks beautiful.

16:55.463 --> 16:57.196
Did he tell you? It might become a chain.

16:57.198 --> 17:00.299
Well, that's a longer term plan.
That's like five years or so.

17:00.301 --> 17:02.268
That is long-term.

17:02.270 --> 17:06.704
In the meantime, are you guys
planning on kids one of these days?

17:06.705 --> 17:08.906
- Here we go.
- What?

17:08.909 --> 17:11.409
They just got married.
It's a fair question.

17:11.411 --> 17:13.711
And one you ask me routinely.

17:13.713 --> 17:15.512
Do they even want kids? I don't.

17:15.515 --> 17:17.742
- Thank god.
- Yeah, maybe.

17:17.750 --> 17:19.082
Who wants more frozen spinach dip?

17:19.084 --> 17:21.885
Or, actually, I think we're
out of that. Frozen bean dip?

17:21.887 --> 17:23.252
- Yes!
- Okay.

17:29.633 --> 17:32.061
Mmm, it's so cuddly in here. Oh!

17:32.086 --> 17:34.987
Oh, no, I have to pee
so bad, but I'm too cozy.

17:34.989 --> 17:38.891
Mmm, you know, our conversations get
deeper and deeper the longer we're married.

17:39.547 --> 17:41.348
- You want deep talk?
- Mmm.

17:41.350 --> 17:44.882
What's with people being so intense about
having babies as soon as you get married?

17:45.486 --> 17:46.887
Are you talking about Elaine?

17:46.889 --> 17:48.222
That's just her.

17:48.224 --> 17:49.923
She's been bugging Nate
about babies forever.

17:49.925 --> 17:51.858
That guy has a lot of condoms.

17:54.564 --> 17:57.165
I was surprised by your answer though.

17:57.190 --> 17:58.390
I didn't know you wanted kids.

17:59.757 --> 18:01.692
I didn't used to.

18:01.717 --> 18:05.101
But, you know, then again, I never
really thought about it either way.

18:05.126 --> 18:07.159
It only occurred to me once I was healthy.

18:09.904 --> 18:12.205
But you're talking, like,
way down the road, right?

18:13.460 --> 18:16.162
Duh! Yeah, we gotta get you healthy,

18:16.187 --> 18:18.054
and get some traveling under our belt,

18:18.079 --> 18:20.612
before we let a kid get
in the way of all our fun.

18:27.298 --> 18:28.932
Okay, I can't hold it anymore.

18:36.391 --> 18:38.692
I have a dummy I can use if
you don't want to stand here.

18:38.694 --> 18:40.993
No, I like it! I feel like a model.

18:40.995 --> 18:44.397
Okay, well, I mean, I need you to
stand a little more like a dummy,

18:44.399 --> 18:47.500
-and be still for a minute, please.
-Sorry.

18:49.645 --> 18:51.512
So, uncle George looked
into that clinical trial,

18:51.537 --> 18:53.537
that isn't approved for AML yet.

18:53.594 --> 18:55.314
-Oh, yeah?
-And you know who makes the drugs?

18:55.854 --> 18:57.587
Pharkas.

18:57.901 --> 19:00.101
Oh! Ew. Where that Josh guy works?

19:01.175 --> 19:02.175
(Scoffs)

19:03.395 --> 19:04.596
Yep.

19:06.403 --> 19:07.636
April,

19:07.661 --> 19:09.394
I would do anything for
love, but I won't do that.

19:09.419 --> 19:10.710
But wouldn't it kinda be worth it?

19:10.735 --> 19:13.535
I mean, just one drink with the guy,
if it could help me get these meds?

19:13.853 --> 19:15.319
Oh, my god.

19:15.625 --> 19:17.092
Okay, yeah. You're right, sorry.

19:17.094 --> 19:18.961
You don't have to do it.
I just... I heard that,

19:18.963 --> 19:20.762
getting on these lists is
more about who you know,

19:20.764 --> 19:22.564
- so I'm just trying to...
- One date.

19:23.716 --> 19:24.916
Really?

19:24.941 --> 19:26.807
Only 'cause it could save your life.

19:26.832 --> 19:29.366
And I'm not drinking. I only
drink with guys I actually like.

19:29.391 --> 19:31.724
-You don't have to sleep with him.
-Oh, my god.

19:35.242 --> 19:36.777
Training time, huh?

19:36.779 --> 19:38.077
Yeah.

19:38.079 --> 19:41.247
William and I are meeting
at Mount Vernon street today.

19:41.249 --> 19:43.116
It's one of the steepest hills in the city.

19:43.118 --> 19:44.984
- Oh, wow, it's like a...
- (Knock on door)

19:44.986 --> 19:47.352
- Can you get it?
- It's like a... hold on.

19:49.221 --> 19:52.290
- Hi, good to see you.
- Good to see you, too.

19:52.315 --> 19:55.257
Hey! I thought I told you to meet me there.

19:55.602 --> 19:56.912
Oh, I was in the neighb, so I...

19:56.937 --> 19:58.236
- Oh!
- Oh!

19:58.457 --> 20:01.539
Oh, you're cuddly today.

20:01.564 --> 20:04.464
- It's crazy to see this guy.
- Right? How long has it been?

20:04.489 --> 20:06.031
Oh, don't tell me. I think we met,

20:06.056 --> 20:08.859
when Sara was at Barnard,
so that was before I...

20:08.884 --> 20:09.942
Oh, wow.

20:10.455 --> 20:12.890
Mmm, you smell fantastic.

20:12.915 --> 20:14.812
-What is that? Aftershave or something?
-No, no, it's...

20:14.837 --> 20:17.137
It's almond milk lotion from L'Occitane.

20:17.162 --> 20:19.296
It's two for one at Nordstrom's.
You want to go halfsies?

20:19.321 --> 20:22.656
Maybe. Anyway, you know
what? Um, we should go.

20:22.681 --> 20:25.315
-I heard it's gonna rain.
-Hey, you coming back for dinner?

20:25.320 --> 20:27.152
- Oh!
- No.

20:27.154 --> 20:30.589
No. Well, I don't know, you
said you had a plan or something.

20:30.591 --> 20:31.679
What was it? You had something.

20:31.704 --> 20:34.166
Oh, no, I forgot. My
friend Alan is coming over.

20:34.191 --> 20:36.523
We're picking up some
tiles for my home spa.

20:36.786 --> 20:39.156
-Steam shower. So excited.
-Wow.

20:39.180 --> 20:41.313
I was gonna put a bidet...

20:41.315 --> 20:43.516
- What?
- Nothing.

20:43.518 --> 20:45.984
It's so funny. A bidet...

20:45.986 --> 20:48.521
-Okay, okay, all right. Have fun, guys.
-Good to see you.

20:51.695 --> 20:54.162
Sorry, all the dishes aren't out yet.

20:54.164 --> 20:57.933
I'm still adjusting to not having
April here to help out with chores.

20:57.935 --> 20:59.401
Oh!

20:59.403 --> 21:01.069
See? My system worked here.

21:01.071 --> 21:03.839
Ugh, the system...

21:03.841 --> 21:05.441
I'm just so excited for real food.

21:05.443 --> 21:06.975
- Oh!
- You go ahead.

21:06.977 --> 21:09.811
- Oh, no, that's okay.
- Please, I must be stopped.

21:09.813 --> 21:12.847
Okay, well, good, because I was
lying when I said "that's okay."

21:12.849 --> 21:15.049
This is an upgrade from our usual affair.

21:15.051 --> 21:17.117
Any progress on finding a place?

21:17.238 --> 21:19.138
Not yet.

21:19.163 --> 21:20.757
Hopefully it won't take long.
I don't need much.

21:20.782 --> 21:22.901
Just another room to
turn into my office.

21:22.926 --> 21:25.078
Well, we might as well get a
third room while we're at it.

21:25.103 --> 21:26.335
For what?

21:26.360 --> 21:29.429
To have extra space, and
eventually for, you know,

21:29.662 --> 21:31.262
offspring.

21:32.364 --> 21:34.799
First comes love, then comes marriage...

21:34.824 --> 21:38.793
Then comes getting rid of the wife's cancer
so she can get a bone marrow transplant.

21:38.818 --> 21:41.195
Of course, I was just
thinking ahead, you know.

21:41.220 --> 21:44.289
I hate moving, so we might as
well get everything we want now,

21:44.314 --> 21:46.296
so we don't have to upgrade later.

21:46.321 --> 21:47.781
Sara: Did you try the okra?

21:47.806 --> 21:50.062
- Leo: No, I hate okra.
- Sara: Really?

22:04.492 --> 22:06.627
I see how your system worked now.

22:06.629 --> 22:11.432
You were the chore supervisor
around here. I get it.

22:11.434 --> 22:13.867
Leo, what's with bringing up
babies in front of my family?

22:15.190 --> 22:17.124
Oh, was that awkward?

22:18.283 --> 22:19.684
Well, yeah.

22:19.709 --> 22:22.744
I didn't realize you were
planning our nursery already.

22:24.068 --> 22:26.670
I didn't mean right away.

22:26.695 --> 22:30.029
And I thought you got your eggs frozen.

22:30.054 --> 22:32.609
I kinda assumed that meant you
wanted to have a kid eventually.

22:32.634 --> 22:35.000
Since that keeps coming
up, I should clarify.

22:37.783 --> 22:39.421
I don't want to have kids anymore.

22:39.446 --> 22:41.359
Um, even...

22:41.713 --> 22:45.115
When you're past this health stuff?

22:45.140 --> 22:47.607
Sorry, I'm just confused here now.

22:48.954 --> 22:50.720
I'm trying to live in the now,

22:50.753 --> 22:52.109
like you taught me to.

22:52.125 --> 22:55.293
Meanwhile, you're planning things
for five and ten years down the road,

22:55.272 --> 22:57.438
and asking me to do them with you?

22:57.440 --> 22:59.607
Which is it? Do I live
in the now or the future?

22:59.609 --> 23:02.178
It's not that black and white.
I don't understand

23:02.203 --> 23:03.745
why you're getting
so upset about this.

23:03.747 --> 23:05.929
Because I can't plan for a future,

23:05.954 --> 23:08.254
just because you have one now.

23:08.279 --> 23:10.479
Now that you're on the other side of this,

23:10.504 --> 23:12.638
you've completely forgotten
what this one feels like.

23:13.784 --> 23:15.578
Hey, dish-dryer,

23:15.793 --> 23:17.393
dry some dishes, why don't ya?

23:34.352 --> 23:37.154
And this is me trying to
let you win. What's going on?

23:37.272 --> 23:38.938
I'm just distracted.

23:39.806 --> 23:41.941
Leo and I got into a fight last night.

23:41.966 --> 23:43.331
It's the first time I slept on the couch.

23:43.428 --> 23:44.995
Ah, it's a rite of passage.

23:44.997 --> 23:46.730
It's not quite as dramatic as it sounds.

23:46.732 --> 23:48.498
Our couch is, like, two
feet away from the bed.

23:48.500 --> 23:49.999
So what happened?

23:50.001 --> 23:52.601
I don't know. I feel
like we switched places.

23:52.603 --> 23:55.054
He wants to plan all these
things for the future.

23:55.078 --> 23:56.845
So when he talks about things like

23:56.847 --> 23:58.480
starting a family,

23:58.482 --> 24:00.273
I'm the one that has to shut it down.

24:00.742 --> 24:02.709
I just feel like I'm holding
him back or something.

24:02.711 --> 24:04.644
I'm sure he doesn't feel that way.

24:04.646 --> 24:06.411
I overreacted.

24:06.413 --> 24:08.413
I'm just trying to figure out
a way to make it up to him now.

24:08.415 --> 24:10.554
Probably, a simple apology would work.

24:10.782 --> 24:12.282
I just want to do something bigger.

24:12.307 --> 24:15.625
You know, he's had to take care
of me so much since we got married,

24:15.807 --> 24:17.840
and since I'm supposed to
be taking it easy these days,

24:17.865 --> 24:20.632
I can't surprise him with
one of our fun adventures.

24:20.965 --> 24:24.332
And I still feel so guilty that
I ruined our honeymoon to Italy.

24:24.334 --> 24:26.449
Oh, well, okay. Well, at least,

24:26.613 --> 24:28.280
take him out to a great Italian meal.

24:28.305 --> 24:30.699
My favorite Italian
food is in the north end.

24:30.724 --> 24:33.473
What if I brought Italy to our apartment?

24:33.978 --> 24:36.344
I could cook, I could decorate,

24:36.369 --> 24:37.895
and it could be like a little...

24:38.043 --> 24:39.342
Like a make-shift honeymoon.

24:39.344 --> 24:41.243
And there you go, see, marriage is simple.

24:41.245 --> 24:43.078
(Chuckles) Yeah, right.

24:43.080 --> 24:45.047
Okay, I should go,

24:45.049 --> 24:47.316
if I'm turning my apartment
into Italy in one day.

24:51.049 --> 24:52.917
Oh, wait, here.

24:52.942 --> 24:54.074
Um...

24:55.610 --> 24:57.042
(Sighs) Here you go.

24:57.067 --> 24:58.233
It's my only copy, so...

24:59.428 --> 25:01.129
I will be careful with it.

25:01.154 --> 25:02.353
Happy reading.

25:26.747 --> 25:28.315
- Hi.
- Hey!

25:28.317 --> 25:29.915
Sorry I'm late.

25:29.917 --> 25:32.818
Oh, no, it's fine. I just got here.

25:32.820 --> 25:34.219
I got us some coffees.

25:34.221 --> 25:37.389
I had kind of a late night last night.

25:37.391 --> 25:38.691
I went to a show.

25:38.693 --> 25:40.926
Let me guess. Coldplay?

25:40.928 --> 25:42.361
Maroon 5?

25:42.363 --> 25:43.696
Jenny Lewis.

25:43.698 --> 25:45.798
Oh! Oh, I love her.

25:46.590 --> 25:47.723
<i>"Troop Beverly Hills"</i> forever.

25:47.725 --> 25:49.592
Hell, yeah.

25:49.594 --> 25:52.761
Thanks for pegging me as
an Adam Levine fan though.

25:52.763 --> 25:54.830
You want to order breakfast?

25:54.832 --> 25:56.499
Uh, you know what? I'm good, actually.

25:56.501 --> 25:58.754
I can't stay for very
long. I gotta get to work.

25:58.779 --> 25:59.945
Oh.

26:02.817 --> 26:05.552
Okay, let's be real. You
don't really want to be here.

26:05.554 --> 26:08.355
-What? I called you, didn't I?
-Yeah.

26:08.357 --> 26:10.390
And now you're squeezing
me in for 20 minutes

26:10.392 --> 26:12.082
during your morning coffee.

26:12.232 --> 26:14.833
So what? Did one of your girlfriends

26:14.858 --> 26:16.892
accuse you of being too picky,

26:16.917 --> 26:18.797
and so you called me to
prove her wrong or what?

26:19.615 --> 26:22.550
Well... I mean, yes.

26:22.575 --> 26:24.608
Yes, a friend did encourage me to call you,

26:24.633 --> 26:26.467
- but I don't think...
- I knew it.

26:26.492 --> 26:28.625
I knew it. All right, you wanna make a bet?

26:28.650 --> 26:30.817
- About what?
- I bet

26:30.842 --> 26:32.926
that by the time you finish that coffee,

26:33.067 --> 26:34.500
you're gonna wanna see me again.

26:34.525 --> 26:36.137
- Oh, really?
- Mmm-hmm.

26:36.362 --> 26:38.696
Hmm, okay.

26:40.200 --> 26:42.000
Okay, that's...

26:42.002 --> 26:43.402
Clearly, you're...

26:43.404 --> 26:45.537
(coughing) So hot.

26:45.539 --> 26:46.905
(Both laughing)

26:46.907 --> 26:48.540
So hot.

26:50.114 --> 26:51.114
Hey!

26:52.167 --> 26:53.534
Hey.

26:53.559 --> 26:55.191
What's going on?

26:55.216 --> 26:57.613
Nothing much. Just
catching up on chemistry.

26:58.309 --> 27:00.310
(Exclaims in disgust) Moles.

27:03.332 --> 27:05.000
Are you feeling okay today?

27:05.025 --> 27:06.725
Yeah, I'm fine.

27:08.314 --> 27:11.883
Okay, what's going on with
you? You're being weird.

27:13.653 --> 27:14.720
Okay.

27:14.833 --> 27:16.300
Remember what you said,

27:16.302 --> 27:18.535
like, right in front of
my face the other day?

27:19.340 --> 27:21.275
That you could never date a guy like me?

27:21.474 --> 27:22.873
I'm sorry, I just... I meant...

27:22.875 --> 27:26.009
It's fine. It's fine, I just...

27:26.011 --> 27:29.612
I mean, I never expected anyone to
be attracted to me, all bald and pale,

27:29.614 --> 27:31.647
and wearing a mask half the time, but...

27:32.926 --> 27:34.193
It sucked to hear it officially,

27:34.218 --> 27:36.218
especially after I stood up for you.

27:38.007 --> 27:39.074
I'm sorry.

27:40.371 --> 27:43.706
It's just that Andrew and Mariah were
making all of these assumptions...

27:43.708 --> 27:45.508
Well, I'm glad you cleared
things up with them.

27:46.822 --> 27:47.888
I gotta go.

27:49.168 --> 27:50.402
Talk to you later.

27:50.404 --> 27:52.081
I'm sorry.

27:54.949 --> 27:57.603
Grazie! Prego!

27:57.629 --> 28:00.230
Ahh, <i>"La Dolce Vita</i>!

28:00.255 --> 28:04.229
Spaghetti! A soup, a
salad, and breadsticks!

28:04.254 --> 28:05.754
They would have loved me in Italy.

28:05.756 --> 28:08.657
The creepy paddle without
a boat is a nice touch.

28:08.659 --> 28:11.460
Oh, why, thank you. I'm turning
our couch into a gondola,

28:11.462 --> 28:13.495
and I'm making fresh linguine.

28:13.497 --> 28:14.871
Leo's gonna be so surprised.

28:14.887 --> 28:16.801
Yeah, seriously. I
think the only pasta I've

28:16.825 --> 28:18.825
ever seen you make is, like, beef-a-roni.

28:18.894 --> 28:22.065
And now you're on your way to
being a real housewife of Boston.

28:22.090 --> 28:23.722
- I am trying.
- Aw!

28:23.724 --> 28:26.113
Thank you guys for helping me, and...

28:26.138 --> 28:29.072
Thank you for letting
me pimp you out to Josh.

28:29.097 --> 28:30.963
- Oh.
- I hope the ends justified the means.

28:30.988 --> 28:33.388
Totally. He seemed happy to help.

28:33.413 --> 28:36.894
I didn't get all the details yet, but we're
meeting up to talk about it more tonight.

28:37.121 --> 28:38.788
-Sorry, you're seeing him again?
-Yeah.

28:38.813 --> 28:40.446
I'm really taking a
bullet for you on this one,

28:40.471 --> 28:43.050
but I'm making him come to my neighborhood,

28:43.223 --> 28:45.189
to that little dive around the corner.

28:45.214 --> 28:47.511
Oh, the one with the dart
boards? I love that bar.

28:47.536 --> 28:48.702
You've been to that bar?

28:50.685 --> 28:52.619
It's a really cute place,

28:52.644 --> 28:54.311
and it serves alcohol.

28:54.336 --> 28:56.636
-You actually like him, don't you?
-Ah...

28:57.832 --> 29:00.233
Uh, whatever... Uh... maybe.

29:00.258 --> 29:02.258
♪ We both have dates tonight ♪

29:02.283 --> 29:06.261
Oh, my god. Oh, my god, April.

29:06.286 --> 29:07.953
- Everything okay, Bren?
- Yeah.

29:08.892 --> 29:10.426
(Sighs) No.

29:10.871 --> 29:13.505
I said something dumb to Finn,

29:13.530 --> 29:15.530
and I hurt his feelings.

29:15.509 --> 29:17.442
I kinda want to text him,

29:17.444 --> 29:19.544
but he'd probably rather
I just leave him alone.

29:19.546 --> 29:21.312
I mean, he's going
through enough right now.

29:21.314 --> 29:24.882
As a sick person, I wouldn't want
someone to give up on me because of that.

29:24.884 --> 29:26.383
Most of the time, I
just want to feel normal.

29:26.385 --> 29:28.820
- I don't even know what to say.
- Just be honest.

29:28.822 --> 29:31.222
You know, just because he's sick
doesn't mean he's that fragile.

29:31.247 --> 29:33.147
And I promise you there will be days where

29:33.172 --> 29:36.940
he's moody and frustrated and
he'll be the one apologizing to you.

29:37.958 --> 29:39.226
Speaking from experience here.

29:41.964 --> 29:43.839
(Squawks)

29:43.864 --> 29:45.197
Really get into the spirit.

29:45.222 --> 29:46.688
- You can do it.
- Oh.

29:46.713 --> 29:48.246
That one sucks.

29:49.082 --> 29:51.015
Look at us, out of our stretchy pants.

29:51.017 --> 29:53.851
And ready to eat. We've earned it.

29:53.853 --> 29:56.054
Will George be joining us?

29:56.056 --> 30:00.291
No, no, he's going out with a friend
tonight, and Brenna's with Ford.

30:00.293 --> 30:02.026
So, it's a perfect night for a date.

30:02.028 --> 30:05.746
I just wanted to make sure I didn't
have to pretend like it's an actual date.

30:05.771 --> 30:08.771
-I'm so sorry.
-I'm happy to be your beard, again.

30:08.796 --> 30:11.262
But why are we doing this exactly?

30:11.589 --> 30:14.652
Because when you're
50-something and single,

30:14.677 --> 30:16.143
people tend to feel sorry for you,

30:16.168 --> 30:18.836
and I just... I don't
need that from George.

30:18.861 --> 30:22.162
So, can we pretend we're in
high school while he's around?

30:22.187 --> 30:23.886
We can break up after he leaves.

30:23.911 --> 30:26.050
Oh, but can I break up with you?

30:26.075 --> 30:29.176
No! I'm supposed to be the
one looking good out of this.

30:29.201 --> 30:32.136
Oh, no, you can look good as the dumpee.
Just tell him you were using me for sex,

30:32.161 --> 30:34.928
and then you were relieved
when I called it off.

30:34.960 --> 30:36.597
Okay, I like that.

30:36.622 --> 30:38.589
This is so stupid, isn't it?

30:38.614 --> 30:40.280
Yeah, you're insane.

30:40.297 --> 30:43.257
I mean, if you wanted to get a boyfriend,
you could just go out and get one.

30:44.348 --> 30:46.416
Mmm.

30:46.731 --> 30:49.378
(Chuckling) And I am buzzed.

30:49.403 --> 30:50.936
- Shall we catch a "T"?
- Yeah.

30:53.231 --> 30:54.697
(Romantic music playing)

30:57.590 --> 31:00.391
- Um, uh, can I just...
- What?

31:00.416 --> 31:03.851
Just, uh, one second.

31:05.736 --> 31:07.103
I have to tell you something.

31:07.770 --> 31:09.670
Here we go.

31:09.695 --> 31:12.030
I knew there had to be
something wrong with you.

31:12.055 --> 31:14.220
Okay, so hit me.

31:14.245 --> 31:15.511
You're married.

31:15.765 --> 31:17.765
You're a devil worshiper.

31:17.790 --> 31:19.156
You eat your couch cushions.

31:19.181 --> 31:20.315
What?

31:20.340 --> 31:23.741
Sorry, I'm addicted to
my strange addiction.

31:25.266 --> 31:26.666
So what is it?

31:30.013 --> 31:35.597
I kind of only asked you out for that
friend of mine that I told you about.

31:36.145 --> 31:39.881
She found out that your company makes
the drug that she needs for leukemia,

31:39.883 --> 31:42.149
- and you know, she thought...
- Thought I could help her.

31:42.151 --> 31:44.519
- Right.
- Got it.

31:44.521 --> 31:46.286
That's just why I asked you out.

31:46.288 --> 31:47.587
I actually like you now.

31:47.589 --> 31:49.155
Oh, you actually like me?

31:49.157 --> 31:50.991
Sorry, that sounded bad.

31:53.224 --> 31:55.051
You can leave if you want.

31:55.076 --> 31:56.742
I totally understand.

31:57.980 --> 32:00.348
I hope you don't though.

32:00.733 --> 32:03.966
I promise I only make out
with guys I actually like.

32:05.950 --> 32:08.886
You know, you really didn't have
to go through all that effort.

32:09.107 --> 32:11.507
I would've tried to
help your friend anyway.

32:14.268 --> 32:15.835
But I'm glad you did.

32:49.409 --> 32:51.044
(Romantic music playing)

32:52.856 --> 32:54.956
Honey, I'm...

32:54.958 --> 32:56.625
home...

33:00.663 --> 33:01.696
Hey.

33:04.794 --> 33:07.571
I felt bad we had to
miss out on Italy, so...

33:07.595 --> 33:08.496
Oh!

33:08.498 --> 33:09.698
Wow!

33:09.700 --> 33:12.200
Way to one-up me on the system.

33:12.202 --> 33:13.300
Here, come here.

33:14.402 --> 33:15.903
There's an oar there.

33:17.372 --> 33:18.539
Ah!

33:19.908 --> 33:21.209
Oh, my god.

33:26.543 --> 33:28.949
Sorry I've been all over the place lately.

33:28.951 --> 33:31.918
It's just a scary time,
not being in treatment.

33:31.943 --> 33:34.762
No, I-I get it.

33:34.939 --> 33:36.906
I know what it's like.

33:36.931 --> 33:39.865
And I also know what I signed up for.

33:39.890 --> 33:41.523
"In sickness and in health."

33:42.537 --> 33:43.836
I just wish it were more health.

33:45.075 --> 33:46.876
So I wanted tonight to be perfect.

33:47.994 --> 33:50.929
Are you kidding me? I can't
believe you did all of this!

33:51.086 --> 33:52.452
Honestly...

33:53.437 --> 33:55.705
It took everything out of me.

33:57.571 --> 33:59.472
I'm completely spent and I hate it.

34:01.499 --> 34:05.102
The reason I keep getting so upset when
you bring up the future is because...

34:05.127 --> 34:07.193
I'm not sure I'll be there to see it.

34:07.954 --> 34:09.286
April...

34:09.312 --> 34:12.112
I want to dream about these
things with you, all of them,

34:12.138 --> 34:14.038
believe me, but...

34:14.063 --> 34:15.440
But there's this...

34:15.853 --> 34:17.886
Voice in the back of my head
that just keeps reminding me

34:17.911 --> 34:20.110
I might not be around long
enough to do any of it.

34:20.136 --> 34:21.598
Hey...

34:21.623 --> 34:22.989
You don't know that.

34:23.934 --> 34:25.014
We both know it's possible.

34:26.670 --> 34:28.103
Anything is possible.

34:29.304 --> 34:33.387
I don't want to spend the rest of our lives

34:33.411 --> 34:36.179
preparing for some worst-case scenario.

34:36.204 --> 34:38.204
And I don't want to promise you things

34:38.228 --> 34:41.770
that I don't know if I can give you.

34:41.795 --> 34:43.728
That's why I said I don't
want a family anymore.

34:44.596 --> 34:46.364
If I were healthy, I would want it.

34:48.473 --> 34:51.492
But I can't help but think if
we bring a child into this world,

34:51.494 --> 34:53.793
- and then something happens to me...
- Come here.

34:58.023 --> 34:59.289
April...

35:00.756 --> 35:03.792
I know there are some promises you
can't make with full certainty...

35:05.434 --> 35:08.736
But people make promises every day,
not knowing what the future holds.

35:08.738 --> 35:10.771
All I'm saying is, we're no different.

35:13.775 --> 35:18.278
I hope, one day, when
we're in a rocking chair...

35:19.408 --> 35:21.009
I'll remind you of this conversation,

35:21.034 --> 35:23.723
and we'll laugh about what
a waste of energy it was,

35:23.748 --> 35:25.414
because in the end...

35:26.426 --> 35:27.826
We had it all.

35:41.834 --> 35:44.207
You know, this table

35:44.232 --> 35:47.666
looks pretty useful all
cleared off like that.

35:49.092 --> 35:50.693
We never ate dinner.

35:50.718 --> 35:52.965
Pasta's always better
the second day anyway.

35:52.990 --> 35:56.591
What about... what about dessert?
I went to Mike's for cannolis.

36:08.919 --> 36:10.420
Good morning.

36:10.422 --> 36:12.422
Good morning.

36:12.424 --> 36:13.992
You running with William today?

36:14.017 --> 36:15.617
No, not today.

36:17.879 --> 36:19.462
And, um...

36:19.464 --> 36:21.785
I want to confess something about William.

36:23.366 --> 36:25.167
Uh, we're not together.

36:25.169 --> 36:26.887
(Sighs) He's gay.

36:27.770 --> 36:30.160
And he's become a dear friend,

36:30.253 --> 36:31.986
but that's all we are.

36:32.176 --> 36:33.457
Hmm.

36:33.482 --> 36:36.216
Well, someone should write
a romantic comedy about this.

36:36.241 --> 36:38.774
I lied to you,

36:38.799 --> 36:41.152
I guess, because I felt like,

36:41.177 --> 36:44.645
you felt sorry for me
for being the single one.

36:44.670 --> 36:46.870
I don't feel sorry for you.

36:46.895 --> 36:49.395
I was just trying to be sensitive, really.

36:49.442 --> 36:52.777
I get that, and I know it
probably feels strange for you

36:52.779 --> 36:54.412
to talk about your
relationship in front of me,

36:54.414 --> 36:56.680
but it doesn't have to, because, really...

36:57.681 --> 36:59.582
I could be dating, if I wanted to.

36:59.607 --> 37:02.041
But I'm choosing to be single right now.

37:03.492 --> 37:05.893
And I'm happy this way.

37:07.621 --> 37:11.494
And I guess I just don't feel like
I should be ashamed about that.

37:12.269 --> 37:13.602
Absolutely not.

37:16.113 --> 37:18.902
So, anyway,

37:18.927 --> 37:20.527
confession over.

37:29.358 --> 37:30.824
Ugh, I hated that movie.

37:31.739 --> 37:32.840
Hey!

37:34.059 --> 37:35.625
Didn't think you were coming back.

37:35.627 --> 37:37.494
I didn't think I was either,

37:37.496 --> 37:39.529
and then I changed my mind,

37:39.531 --> 37:43.133
just like how I change my mind every
day about what gender I'm attracted to.

37:44.151 --> 37:46.619
Hey, Mariah, I was wondering,

37:46.739 --> 37:48.338
what made you a lesbian?

37:48.363 --> 37:50.230
I was born this way.

37:50.255 --> 37:53.059
So, when you're with a girl,
who's the boy in the relationship?

37:54.007 --> 37:55.875
No one. There is no boy.

37:55.948 --> 37:58.715
But Andrew's the girl of you two, right?

37:58.740 --> 38:01.535
- Obvi.
- No.

38:01.819 --> 38:04.885
There's not a heteronormative
dynamic in all relationships.

38:05.255 --> 38:07.371
Oh, there isn't?

38:07.396 --> 38:09.630
That's just a stereotype?

38:09.783 --> 38:12.384
Ooh. She's reading you.

38:13.259 --> 38:15.694
My point is, we're all different.

38:15.719 --> 38:17.852
So we shouldn't generalize
about each other.

38:17.877 --> 38:20.977
I mean, isn't that the whole
point of having an LGBTQ club?

38:21.002 --> 38:23.503
Hey, Brenna. Is everything okay?

38:23.528 --> 38:24.794
Yeah.

38:24.819 --> 38:27.352
I'm just making Andrew
and Mariah uncomfortable

38:27.377 --> 38:29.678
<i>because I don't fit into
their neat, little boxes.</i>

38:30.189 --> 38:31.895
Girl, I hear you on that.

38:35.151 --> 38:38.152
Anybody have any good news they
want to share from this week or... ?

38:38.793 --> 38:41.918
How about, um, maybe some roses and thorns?

38:44.078 --> 38:45.411
Hi.

38:45.436 --> 38:49.238
Don't you have LGBT something club?

38:50.111 --> 38:51.660
Yeah, um,

38:51.684 --> 38:53.817
but I wanted to clear something up first.

38:53.819 --> 38:56.353
If you're trying to apologize
about the other day, it's fine.

38:56.355 --> 38:58.221
- I know you feel bad, but...
- No.

39:00.277 --> 39:03.680
You always say that you want to
be treated like everyone else,

39:03.705 --> 39:05.504
so I'm telling you the truth.

39:07.069 --> 39:09.404
And the truth is,

39:09.429 --> 39:11.895
when I told Andrew and Mariah

39:11.920 --> 39:14.988
that I didn't see you like that,

39:15.013 --> 39:18.180
it's not that I couldn't, it's that...

39:18.205 --> 39:20.715
I don't let myself,

39:20.740 --> 39:23.307
- because...
- What could we do about it?

39:23.332 --> 39:26.132
Yeah, I mean, it's dangerous if
the wrong person breathes on you.

39:26.157 --> 39:27.490
Right.

39:31.730 --> 39:33.897
I wonder if this is how
Edward and Bella felt.

39:36.306 --> 39:37.639
