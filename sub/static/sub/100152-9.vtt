WEBVTT

00:10.219 --> 00:14.598
And now, to our continuing coverage
of NASA's first manned mission

00:14.681 --> 00:17.726
since the explosion of Apollo 23.

00:18.268 --> 00:22.606
Two-and-a-half hours ago,
Apollo 24 launched from Cape Kennedy

00:22.689 --> 00:25.067
to relieve Captain Edward Baldwin,

00:25.150 --> 00:30.155
who has been stranded
on the moon for 159 days.

00:30.239 --> 00:34.284
The crew is now preparing to fire
the ship's engine once again

00:34.368 --> 00:38.080
for what is called
the translunar injection, or TLI,

00:38.163 --> 00:41.333
which will send astronauts Wilson,
Liu, and Slayton

00:41.416 --> 00:43.460
out of Earth's orbit toward the moon.

00:46.505 --> 00:51.510
Okay, Houston, ball's lined up.
We're ready for translunar injection.

00:51.969 --> 00:55.389
Roger, Deke. Copy,
24 is ready to burn for the moon.

00:55.472 --> 00:58.267
So, how'd you like the ride so far?

00:58.642 --> 01:02.312
No doubt in your mind,
when this Saturn lifts off, it hauls ass.

01:03.772 --> 01:05.065
I thought you'd like that.

01:09.194 --> 01:11.238
Will you look at that sunrise?

01:13.073 --> 01:17.870
24, Houston.
Word from here is you are go for TLI.

01:17.953 --> 01:19.788
Copy. Osprey is go for TLI.

01:20.455 --> 01:23.250
24, Houston. Spacecraft is all yours.

01:23.333 --> 01:24.334
Roger, Gordo.

01:24.835 --> 01:27.254
Okay. We are in operating mode.

01:27.588 --> 01:30.174
Let's go high bit rate. Record.

01:30.632 --> 01:34.428
Forward. Command reset.
EMS mode to normal.

01:34.761 --> 01:36.263
EMS mode to normal.

01:36.847 --> 01:38.891
S-II SEP lights coming on.

01:38.974 --> 01:40.434
Right on time.

01:40.517 --> 01:44.771
Okay. You've hit the burn window.
Looking great.

01:44.855 --> 01:46.106
Okay.

01:47.941 --> 01:48.942
Let's go to the moon.

01:49.735 --> 01:51.195
Five seconds to ignition.

01:51.904 --> 01:57.242
Five, four, three, two, one.

01:57.326 --> 01:58.535
Ignition.

02:03.999 --> 02:07.461
Houston, 24. We have a failure to ignite.

02:07.878 --> 02:11.381
Master alarm,
master caution lights and tone.

02:12.716 --> 02:15.552
Nothing's breaking off,
but we seem to have a bent bird here.

02:15.886 --> 02:19.598
Okay. We'll take the dump on your data
and see what's gone south.

02:25.395 --> 02:28.023
Well... we're not dead.

04:01.033 --> 04:04.119
I should've gone with the blue
pinstripe suit. It was more dignified.

04:04.703 --> 04:06.788
No. No, no.

04:08.123 --> 04:09.458
You made the right choice.

04:21.970 --> 04:24.389
It's the last set of clothes
I'm ever gonna buy him.

04:27.976 --> 04:29.478
That's it.

04:31.104 --> 04:32.397
Right here.

04:43.116 --> 04:44.409
You know what?

04:46.328 --> 04:48.497
I'm gonna drop these off
at the funeral home.

04:48.580 --> 04:50.249
No, that's all right. I can do it.
Thank you.

04:50.332 --> 04:52.876
You need to go and train for 25. I got it.

04:52.960 --> 04:53.961
Karen...

04:56.505 --> 04:58.590
let me do this for you, please.

05:03.470 --> 05:04.596
Okay?

05:05.514 --> 05:06.849
-All right.
-Okay.

05:11.270 --> 05:12.563
Jesus.

05:13.564 --> 05:15.732
-Who is that?
-It's just Marge--

05:15.816 --> 05:19.194
-Trace, who's here?
-It's Marge, and Gloria, and Cecilia Liu.

05:19.278 --> 05:23.407
Look, they just thought that today
would be a good day to be together.

05:23.490 --> 05:25.701
You know,
Deke's finally on his way to the moon,

05:25.784 --> 05:28.120
and they'll be able to relieve Ed
in a few days.

05:28.203 --> 05:29.413
And then Ed will be home--

05:29.496 --> 05:31.206
No, I'm not up for that.
I'm not up for that.

05:31.290 --> 05:34.668
I don't-- I'm not--
I just wanna go back to bed.

05:34.751 --> 05:39.256
I don't... want them here.
I just... wanna go back to sleep.

05:39.631 --> 05:41.258
I need them to leave me alone.

05:41.341 --> 05:44.011
Just-- Ed and I
both just need to be left alone.

05:44.094 --> 05:45.304
Okay.

05:46.889 --> 05:49.516
You don't have to worry
about entertaining them.

05:49.933 --> 05:51.685
They're just here to hang out.

05:52.019 --> 05:53.353
Pick up the phone...

05:55.189 --> 05:57.858
maybe make you something to eat
if you're hungry.

05:59.860 --> 06:02.362
You just rest, baby. Okay?

06:02.446 --> 06:04.072
It's all you gotta do.

07:27.990 --> 07:29.700
Pre-ignition sequence looks normal.

07:30.242 --> 07:33.245
We saw good precool
and pressurization in the S-IVB tanks.

07:33.662 --> 07:37.291
But no spark. Like the ASI is stone-dead.

07:38.709 --> 07:41.044
Might be a grounding fault
outside the CSM.

07:41.461 --> 07:43.380
Heck, we've looked
at just about everything else.

07:43.463 --> 07:47.467
Well, we better come up with something.
Ed's been up there too long already.

07:47.551 --> 07:48.802
Amen, brother.

07:49.386 --> 07:51.180
You got something for us, Gordo?

07:51.263 --> 07:53.307
That's affirmative.
We've identified the problem.

07:53.891 --> 07:57.060
Flight control computer's got a bad board
in the control circuit.

07:57.144 --> 08:00.689
The bad news is
it's in the Saturn instrument unit,

08:00.772 --> 08:02.482
and it can't be repaired.

08:02.566 --> 08:03.859
Shit!

08:04.276 --> 08:05.944
You're gonna need a new one.

08:06.028 --> 08:07.571
Well, bring us one.

08:08.572 --> 08:12.451
It's funny you mention that.
Someone's gonna do just that.

08:12.868 --> 08:13.869
Who?

08:14.244 --> 08:18.373
This is our payload.
The Saturn V flight control computer.

08:18.457 --> 08:21.335
One of several computers
aboard the spacecraft.

08:21.418 --> 08:23.795
It lives way up here
in the Saturn instrument ring

08:23.879 --> 08:25.923
on the third stage of the launch vehicle.

08:26.256 --> 08:28.884
And once we rendezvous with Apollo 24,

08:28.967 --> 08:34.306
I'll keep station as we link the two ships
with a tether and diagnostic cable.

08:34.389 --> 08:39.269
And then connect the new computer
to their instrument ring.

08:39.352 --> 08:42.731
Now,
the instrument ring is 22 feet across.

08:42.813 --> 08:47.653
The unit is 18 feet from
the only access point, which is this door.

08:47.736 --> 08:49.821
So we will need to enter the ring,
cross it,

08:49.905 --> 08:52.032
and then swap out
the old FCC for the new one.

08:52.324 --> 08:54.243
Do you really think you can pull this off?

08:54.326 --> 08:58.580
They're our best option. They've already
got the skill set to do this.

08:58.664 --> 09:01.750
Spent the last year doing EVA training
for the orbiting observatory.

09:02.167 --> 09:05.838
Not to mention our ride is stacked
on pad 39-B right now.

09:06.463 --> 09:08.340
Then why are we not sending you
to the moon?

09:08.423 --> 09:10.926
Well, our booster isn't powerful enough
to break Earth orbit.

09:11.218 --> 09:13.262
It's a Saturn IB, not a V, sir.

09:13.554 --> 09:14.638
Bingo. Now,

09:15.055 --> 09:18.976
Deke will have a live video feed back to
MOCR in case you all got any questions.

09:19.059 --> 09:22.020
Harrison Liu, on 24, will be assisting me.

09:24.565 --> 09:25.691
Then let's do it.

09:25.774 --> 09:28.610
You leave for the Cape tomorrow morning.
Launch in two days.

09:28.694 --> 09:29.695
Thank you, sir.

09:49.173 --> 09:50.841
You got into the Kennedy School?

09:52.217 --> 09:53.427
Were you searching my room?

09:53.510 --> 09:57.723
No. I was just changing the sheets,
and this fell on the floor.

09:57.806 --> 09:59.349
Pero, why didn't you tell me?

10:00.350 --> 10:02.603
Because I'm not sure if I wanna go.

10:04.813 --> 10:06.106
What?

10:06.773 --> 10:09.735
Aleida, after all the sacrifices
we made to get here...

10:10.235 --> 10:13.697
Your mother's dreams for you
and how hard you studied...

10:14.281 --> 10:15.616
Just wanna throw it all away?

10:15.699 --> 10:19.786
I'm not throwing anything away, Papa.
The kids at my school, they go to college.

10:20.495 --> 10:23.415
It's because of this boy. Anthony.

10:23.999 --> 10:25.292
He talked you out of this.

10:25.375 --> 10:28.670
He doesn't even know about it.
I just wanna stay with my friends.

10:28.754 --> 10:30.714
No, you don't want to leave him.

10:31.882 --> 10:36.261
Do you think Ms. Madison got to
where she is by chasing boys?

10:36.720 --> 10:38.305
This isn't Mexico.

10:39.306 --> 10:41.892
The people here actually
have fun sometimes.

10:42.184 --> 10:44.937
You don't understand
how things work in America.

10:46.855 --> 10:50.192
I understand very well
how things work in America.

10:51.235 --> 10:52.569
You're grounded.

11:02.329 --> 11:03.413
Hey.

11:03.497 --> 11:07.042
You just got off console,
and you're in here getting hammered?

11:07.668 --> 11:09.086
It's a ginger ale.

11:09.169 --> 11:10.420
Right.

11:11.463 --> 11:12.756
Tell her, Pam.

11:13.173 --> 11:14.216
It's true.

11:14.591 --> 11:17.886
I offered to make him a Shirley Temple,
but he wanted it neat.

11:22.850 --> 11:24.601
All right. Why am I here?

11:25.978 --> 11:27.896
I wanted to talk to you about something.

11:28.564 --> 11:31.191
Don't worry. It's good news.
It's really good.

11:31.984 --> 11:35.696
I had sort of a breakthrough, Dani.

11:36.154 --> 11:37.447
Dr. Marsten, he--

11:37.531 --> 11:39.116
You're still seeing that shrink?

11:40.534 --> 11:42.703
Gordo, you know that if they find out--

11:42.786 --> 11:44.538
If they find out what? That I'm a liar?

11:45.664 --> 11:46.790
I am a liar.

11:47.916 --> 11:49.376
What are you talking about?

11:50.460 --> 11:53.130
I've decided I'm not gonna
keep secrets anymore.

11:54.339 --> 11:57.009
I want the world to know
what really happened up there.

11:57.509 --> 12:02.890
So, you want to make an honest man
of yourself by exposing me as a liar?

12:02.973 --> 12:04.016
No.

12:05.350 --> 12:07.144
I want to tell the truth.

12:07.644 --> 12:10.439
The people should know that
you're the real hero, not me.

12:10.522 --> 12:12.774
I know the truth, all right?

12:12.858 --> 12:14.484
That's all that matters.

12:14.568 --> 12:18.655
I broke my arm to save a fellow astronaut
who was going through a rough patch.

12:18.739 --> 12:19.740
I'm proud of that.

12:19.823 --> 12:22.492
Yeah, and I'm proud of you too.
And I'm grateful.

12:22.576 --> 12:24.286
Then keep your mouth shut.

12:24.369 --> 12:27.247
Because if you breathe a word
about what really happened

12:27.331 --> 12:30.709
out of some misguided sense of justice,

12:30.792 --> 12:33.504
you know damn well they will ground me.

12:34.755 --> 12:38.425
And I have worked too hard to get here,
Gordo.

12:39.510 --> 12:41.261
Don't you dare take that away from me.

12:59.404 --> 13:00.447
Karen?

13:01.406 --> 13:05.702
Sweetheart?
Look what I brought you. My corn bread.

13:07.079 --> 13:11.834
Come on. Here,
you have got to eat something.

13:11.917 --> 13:13.669
Just a few bites at least. Come on.

13:16.755 --> 13:18.173
Thatta girl.

13:27.307 --> 13:33.021
Karen, maybe you need to take a shower,
come out, and join the rest of us.

13:33.105 --> 13:37.025
Gloria's here. Cecilia is here.
And everyone would love to see you.

13:53.792 --> 13:54.960
Okay.

13:56.712 --> 13:59.214
You just give a holler
if you need anything.

13:59.840 --> 14:01.008
All right.

15:39.022 --> 15:42.192
You know I'll only be gone for a few days,
right?

15:50.200 --> 15:51.410
Danny...

15:53.328 --> 15:55.038
you sure you don't wanna talk about it?

15:59.710 --> 16:01.712
Hon,
you haven't said a word since Shane...

16:11.972 --> 16:13.015
Is that...

16:13.974 --> 16:15.309
He forgot it here.

16:19.313 --> 16:20.564
Honey...

16:22.399 --> 16:24.484
I know how close y'all were.

16:28.071 --> 16:30.157
Please tell me how you're feeling.

16:34.036 --> 16:36.288
You wanna talk to Pastor Callanan?

16:36.997 --> 16:39.791
-No.
-Why not?

16:41.251 --> 16:42.753
He smells like onions.

16:47.716 --> 16:49.510
All right, how about this?

16:50.636 --> 16:55.015
How 'bout when I get back,
we go to Galveston? Just you and me.

16:55.766 --> 16:56.934
What about Dad and Jimmy?

16:57.434 --> 17:00.521
Yeah, I think they'll be fine without us
for a few days. What do you think?

17:00.604 --> 17:01.605
Yeah.

17:02.689 --> 17:04.397
Yeah, all right.

17:04.483 --> 17:05.651
Come here.

17:10.364 --> 17:11.490
I love you, baby.

17:11.573 --> 17:12.906
Love you, Mom.

17:19.704 --> 17:23.836
Your supervisor, Mr. Reilly,
thinks the world of you.

17:24.586 --> 17:26.922
Says he wishes he had
20 more custodians like you.

17:29.216 --> 17:31.260
Mr. Reilly has been very good to me.

17:32.469 --> 17:35.138
Do you enjoy working here, Mr. Rosales?

17:37.224 --> 17:39.351
Well, yes.

17:40.143 --> 17:42.104
Everybody's very nice to me.

17:42.187 --> 17:46.608
And to be working for the people that are
putting men and women on the moon is...

17:47.776 --> 17:48.861
well, it's a dream.

17:49.319 --> 17:53.073
It certainly seems to have done wonders
for your health. You look incredible.

17:54.116 --> 17:57.286
Considering you were hit by a semitruck

17:57.828 --> 17:59.872
and pronounced dead
by a coroner six years ago.

18:01.582 --> 18:02.791
I don't understand.

18:03.208 --> 18:06.211
Your Social Security number
belongs to a dead man.

18:09.965 --> 18:11.884
-Well--
-Who gave it to you?

18:13.177 --> 18:16.013
This man sold it to me
so I could get a job.

18:16.388 --> 18:17.806
What man? What's his name?

18:18.724 --> 18:19.850
I don't know.

18:22.186 --> 18:25.397
Is... Is this him?

18:27.232 --> 18:28.233
No.

18:28.525 --> 18:29.610
You sure?

18:30.027 --> 18:31.028
Take a good look.

18:31.612 --> 18:32.613
Yeah.

18:33.030 --> 18:34.990
His name is Valery Kostikov.

18:35.490 --> 18:38.577
He's stationed at the Soviet embassy
in Mexico City.

18:38.994 --> 18:41.496
The CIA suspects he's a KGB agent.

18:41.997 --> 18:43.540
I don't know him.

18:43.624 --> 18:46.710
Seems he spoke with Lee Harvey Oswald,
among others.

18:46.793 --> 18:48.795
Have you also been in contact with him?

18:48.879 --> 18:50.422
No. Never.

18:51.548 --> 18:55.177
How about this gentleman. Do you know him?

18:58.055 --> 18:59.973
I need you to say yes or no.

19:02.309 --> 19:03.560
No.

19:04.436 --> 19:06.063
His name is Jack McManus.

19:06.146 --> 19:09.566
He's a vice president at FIP Systems
in Anaheim, California.

19:09.650 --> 19:11.818
FIP is a NASA contractor.

19:12.611 --> 19:16.073
We arrested him two days ago
for selling secrets to the Soviets.

19:16.156 --> 19:18.158
He's willing to name his accomplices.

19:18.242 --> 19:23.330
So think very carefully
before you answer again.

19:24.373 --> 19:25.832
Do you know him?

19:26.375 --> 19:29.711
Look, I-- I just work here.

19:29.795 --> 19:32.381
I clean the offices. I--

19:32.464 --> 19:36.468
And occasionally remove design documents,
which you then pass on--

19:36.552 --> 19:38.220
Hey, hey! I--

19:39.346 --> 19:40.597
I do not steal.

19:40.681 --> 19:44.309
Then how do you explain the fact
that we found these in your locker?

19:44.393 --> 19:47.729
Well, those--
They were in the trash. It was--

19:48.063 --> 19:50.357
I took them to give them to--

19:50.858 --> 19:54.111
-To whom?
-I wasn't gonna...

19:54.194 --> 19:56.572
Who were you going to give them to?

19:57.197 --> 19:58.532
To my friend.

19:58.615 --> 20:01.326
She loves space.

20:03.203 --> 20:05.205
It was just for souvenirs.

20:09.418 --> 20:11.003
I'm gonna ask you one last time.

20:12.629 --> 20:13.881
Who recruited you?

20:16.216 --> 20:17.509
Okay.

20:18.177 --> 20:19.887
I don't know anything about these people.

20:23.098 --> 20:24.141
I swear.

20:24.433 --> 20:26.560
I'm very disappointed, Mr. Rosales.

20:28.145 --> 20:30.355
I hoped you'd be more cooperative.

20:31.940 --> 20:33.150
We're done.

20:39.907 --> 20:41.950
What? What is this?

20:42.868 --> 20:44.953
Where are you taking me? Hey.

20:56.173 --> 21:01.094
NASA's daring repair mission continues
as two hours and ten minutes ago,

21:01.178 --> 21:04.973
mission commander Molly Cobb,
mission specialist Dennis Lambert,

21:05.057 --> 21:08.143
and rookie command module pilot
Tracy Stevens

21:08.227 --> 21:12.564
brought Apollo 25 within feet
of the ailing Apollo 24.

21:12.648 --> 21:15.734
The crafts are flying
alongside each other in orbit

21:15.817 --> 21:18.445
more than a hundred miles
above the Earth's surface,

21:18.529 --> 21:22.115
with the repair mission slated to begin
in the next hour or two.

21:22.199 --> 21:24.868
And in political news,
in the wake of a sex scandal

21:24.952 --> 21:28.163
and the failures of NASA
under his administration,

21:28.247 --> 21:30.541
it remains to be seen if Mr. Kennedy

21:30.624 --> 21:34.002
can gain his party's nomination
for a second term.

21:34.086 --> 21:36.588
Party leaders are convening
in Washington this week

21:36.672 --> 21:39.883
to discuss the strategy
for next year's elections.

21:39.967 --> 21:43.303
Democratic officials
have been quick to refute any suggestions

21:43.387 --> 21:46.640
that the president does not have
the party's full support.

23:17.272 --> 23:18.440
Danny.

23:20.567 --> 23:22.653
Danny,
what are you doing in Shane's bedroom?

23:22.736 --> 23:26.865
He left his pinewood derby car
at my house. I brought it back.

23:27.449 --> 23:30.953
I didn't want to bother you.
Please don't tell my mom.

23:31.036 --> 23:32.663
No. Of course, it's fine.

23:33.330 --> 23:35.415
I'm sorry about Shane.

23:39.419 --> 23:41.505
Honey, I know. I--

23:41.588 --> 23:42.631
You don't know.

23:44.633 --> 23:47.177
I wanted to break the water meters,

23:47.261 --> 23:51.181
and I let everybody think
that it was Shane's idea.

23:51.515 --> 23:53.809
I'm so, so sorry.

23:56.562 --> 23:57.938
I--

24:02.150 --> 24:04.611
Karen. Honey, what's wrong?

24:05.487 --> 24:06.655
Karen?

24:08.282 --> 24:11.827
No. Give her a chance to get some air.
She'll be back.

24:24.173 --> 24:25.424
Karen, what are you doing here?

24:28.093 --> 24:29.386
I don't know.

24:32.139 --> 24:35.934
Nice and slow. And hold it.

24:38.604 --> 24:39.980
Okay, that's enough.

24:41.940 --> 24:43.817
Let it settle and see how you feel.

24:49.990 --> 24:52.492
What? No. No.

24:53.118 --> 24:55.495
-No.
-Yeah.

24:55.996 --> 24:58.916
I'm sorry.
I cannot envision you as a doctor.

24:58.999 --> 25:03.504
Well, my father runs
the All Saints Clinic at MD Anderson.

25:03.587 --> 25:08.759
Really? The cancer clinic.
The one that's won all the awards.

25:08.842 --> 25:09.968
Yeah.

25:10.052 --> 25:13.472
I was supposed to join him
after med school. That was Dad's plan.

25:14.640 --> 25:18.185
But the deeper I got,
the more I realized it just wasn't for me.

25:18.977 --> 25:20.103
So what'd you do?

25:21.647 --> 25:24.858
I had a final in organic chemistry.

25:25.651 --> 25:28.904
To prep, I engaged in
a little organic chemistry of my own

25:28.987 --> 25:32.115
and downed a hit of LSD.

25:32.199 --> 25:34.159
-You're kidding me.
-Yeah.

25:34.993 --> 25:39.122
By the time we reached the oral portion
of the exam, I am peaking.

25:39.206 --> 25:41.750
I held forth my theories on mortality.

25:41.834 --> 25:45.337
-Made some salient points, I thought.
-Yes.

25:46.046 --> 25:48.048
My professors disagreed.

25:48.131 --> 25:51.468
I was called into the dean's office
the next day and expelled.

25:52.219 --> 25:53.345
Wow.

25:54.930 --> 25:57.724
Your father must have been furious.

25:58.350 --> 25:59.935
He disowned me.

26:00.894 --> 26:04.189
I was supposed to feel ashamed,
but the weird thing is, is I didn't.

26:05.482 --> 26:08.402
I felt... triumphant.

26:09.027 --> 26:12.531
Because until that moment,
I had been living someone else's life.

26:13.073 --> 26:17.619
I was the good little boy always
trying to earn another gold star.

26:17.703 --> 26:21.456
From my dad, from my professors,
other students.

26:22.082 --> 26:24.960
But that day,
I walked off campus a free man.

26:26.545 --> 26:28.922
Headed to Austin and began a new life.

26:30.007 --> 26:31.300
My life.

26:31.383 --> 26:32.718
I was...

26:34.094 --> 26:37.556
just thinking about when I was 12.

26:39.183 --> 26:40.809
Back in Gary, Indiana.

26:41.268 --> 26:43.645
I was walking home from school one day...

26:45.147 --> 26:49.902
and there was this boy,
a couple years older than me,

26:50.611 --> 26:55.032
in a vacant lot,
setting off bottle rockets.

26:55.532 --> 26:56.658
Ed?

26:56.742 --> 26:57.743
Yep.

26:58.202 --> 27:00.204
So it was love at first sight?

27:00.287 --> 27:02.873
Yeah. Something like that.

27:04.875 --> 27:09.338
My parents were Irish immigrants.

27:11.131 --> 27:13.425
And Ed was very different than them.

27:14.551 --> 27:16.053
So American.

27:17.095 --> 27:21.517
You know, obsessed with cars
and airplanes and rockets.

27:22.768 --> 27:26.563
All of the fantastic machines
that were gonna whisk us off

27:26.647 --> 27:29.441
to a great big beautiful tomorrow.

27:31.026 --> 27:32.194
I don't know.

27:32.778 --> 27:35.197
I guess I just wanted
to be a part of the adventure.

27:36.156 --> 27:39.451
Like he is the pilot,
and you are his copilot.

27:39.535 --> 27:40.661
Yeah.

27:42.037 --> 27:43.038
Only...

27:44.164 --> 27:47.960
somehow, over the years,
I became part of the ground crew.

27:48.752 --> 27:50.170
Paths change.

27:52.297 --> 27:53.465
Yeah.

27:57.094 --> 27:58.262
Yeah, I know.

28:00.514 --> 28:02.599
I know things have to change.

28:04.977 --> 28:06.979
I don't even know what my life is anymore.

28:07.479 --> 28:09.314
I don't. I mean, I'm...

28:10.065 --> 28:15.487
I mean, I was in my house,
surrounded by my closest friends, and...

28:16.071 --> 28:17.990
You know, I thought that that would help.

28:19.157 --> 28:22.452
'Cause we've been through
everything together, everything.

28:22.870 --> 28:27.291
Christenings and birthdays, weddings.

28:28.667 --> 28:30.252
Even funerals.

28:31.336 --> 28:33.005
And I thought...

28:34.131 --> 28:36.550
"These people are my family."

28:37.050 --> 28:38.468
You know? My family.

28:39.386 --> 28:43.724
And then I looked at these women
in my kitchen, and...

28:45.767 --> 28:50.731
I don't know. Suddenly, I realized,
after all of this time, I...

28:53.525 --> 28:55.235
I have no fucking idea who they are.

28:57.696 --> 28:58.697
None.

29:00.908 --> 29:02.868
I have that thought every Thanksgiving.

29:04.745 --> 29:06.121
Yeah.

29:06.622 --> 29:07.789
Yeah.

29:09.917 --> 29:14.421
I just... You know,
behind all of the rituals and the rules...

29:16.673 --> 29:17.883
what is there?

29:20.677 --> 29:21.970
Who are they?

29:25.891 --> 29:28.519
Sounds like you're really asking
who you are.

29:45.160 --> 29:48.539
Okay. Last fastener.

29:48.622 --> 29:52.334
The thousand-dollar socket wrench
works as advertised.

29:52.417 --> 29:53.919
You sound surprised.

29:54.002 --> 29:57.923
Said the man with
the busted $200 million spaceship.

29:58.006 --> 29:59.383
Hey, who's making you look good?

29:59.800 --> 30:01.927
How would anybody know
it's me in this rig?

30:02.219 --> 30:04.263
Every move is full of attitude.

30:04.346 --> 30:05.806
Okay, Houston.

30:05.889 --> 30:08.809
I can see the computer across the ring.

30:09.226 --> 30:12.271
Going now to unhook the old FCC.

30:12.354 --> 30:13.814
Roger that, 25.

30:13.897 --> 30:16.859
24, your Maytag repair crew
is right on schedule.

30:17.276 --> 30:20.028
Molly, you did remember to bring
the new one up with you, right?

30:20.445 --> 30:23.407
Shit, Dani,
I thought you packed it for me.

30:35.586 --> 30:37.087
What the fuck?

31:13.916 --> 31:15.667
Looks like we got visitors.

32:52.639 --> 32:56.727
Houston, we're running
the continuity check to 24's FCC.

32:56.810 --> 32:57.811
Copy that, 25.

32:57.895 --> 33:00.606
Now,
if Tracy will just keep the ship steady...

33:01.565 --> 33:05.694
Denny's getting carsick.
Can I offer you a Dramamine?

33:05.986 --> 33:07.988
No, but I'd kill for a cigarette.

33:08.071 --> 33:09.489
Oh, roger that.

33:09.573 --> 33:12.743
All right,
the unit's installed and I am heading out.

33:12.826 --> 33:14.036
Dennis, how we looking?

33:14.953 --> 33:19.541
Continuity checks good.
24 now has a functioning unit.

33:19.625 --> 33:21.627
Harry, you can unhook the diagnostic line.

33:21.710 --> 33:25.172
Looks like Molly got the FCC installed
right the first time.

33:25.255 --> 33:28.050
Our work guaranteed or your money back.

33:28.383 --> 33:31.720
Diagnostic line is now free.
Thanks for the service call, 25.

33:32.137 --> 33:33.597
Houston, 24.

33:33.680 --> 33:36.934
We're ready to switch it into our system
and initiate the self-test.

33:38.143 --> 33:41.271
Okay. Round the horn for FCC power up
and self-test.

33:41.355 --> 33:42.731
-GUIDO?
-Go for power up.

33:42.814 --> 33:44.024
-Booster?
-Go.

33:44.107 --> 33:45.400
-FIDO?
-Go.

33:45.484 --> 33:46.944
-INCO?
-Go.

33:47.027 --> 33:50.948
Houston, 24,
you are go for FCC power up and self-test.

33:51.031 --> 33:52.491
Pushing in the breaker now.

33:53.450 --> 33:55.160
DSKY is back online.

33:56.995 --> 33:58.121
Wait a minute.

34:00.749 --> 34:03.877
Tank pressures are rising,
and I'm showing turbo pump startup.

34:06.463 --> 34:08.966
Shit. Get 'em away from that booster.
It's still armed.

34:14.847 --> 34:17.306
Oh, shit! Oh, shit! Oh, shit! No! No!

34:24.313 --> 34:26.065
Molly, are you clear of the RCS?

34:26.149 --> 34:28.068
Damn it, Tracy! Don't overcorrect!

34:28.150 --> 34:31.487
I'm trying to regain control,
but we're still tethered to 24.

34:33.907 --> 34:35.701
Come closer. I'll untether you.

34:35.784 --> 34:38.370
Molly, you do that
and you'll cut your own safety line.

34:38.453 --> 34:40.581
Who gives a damn? Save the ship.

34:52.926 --> 34:54.094
I've lost the video feed.

34:54.178 --> 34:55.429
Medical telemetry's gone.

34:55.512 --> 34:57.723
Flight,
24's guidance system just dropped out.

34:58.599 --> 34:59.600
Jesus Christ!

34:59.683 --> 35:02.728
Everyone, calm down.
Give me a status report on Cobb.

35:03.437 --> 35:05.105
Molly, Houston. You still with us?

35:05.189 --> 35:07.399
I'm still breathing. I couldn't hang on.

35:07.482 --> 35:11.111
My ship's 100 yards off
and getting farther away by the second.

35:11.195 --> 35:12.654
-You okay?
-Yeah.

35:12.738 --> 35:15.741
But I got a half hour, maybe, of O2 left.

35:15.824 --> 35:18.243
Flight, guidance and nav screens
are all junk.

35:18.327 --> 35:20.621
Molly, where's Apollo 24 now?

35:20.704 --> 35:23.207
Kinda like a bat out of hell to somewhere.

35:23.916 --> 35:26.835
Flight, the carrier wave from Apollo 24
just dropped out.

35:26.919 --> 35:28.253
No telemetry or voice comm.

35:28.670 --> 35:32.257
Last thing I got was the IV-B ignition,
Flight. Booster readouts are dead.

35:32.633 --> 35:34.426
What the hell is happening here?

35:35.594 --> 35:39.014
Apollo 24's third-stage engine
did an uncommanded burn.

35:39.306 --> 35:42.392
Its guidance program must not have reset
and told it to fire.

35:43.644 --> 35:45.395
Trace,
what's the status of your spacecraft?

35:45.479 --> 35:47.272
Banged up, still functioning.

35:47.356 --> 35:48.482
Looking for Molly.

35:49.066 --> 35:50.776
GUIDO, team up with INCO and Gordo.

35:50.859 --> 35:53.612
Focus your teams on restoring comm to 24.

35:54.029 --> 35:55.614
Figure out their status
and where they're headed.

35:55.697 --> 35:57.407
-On it, Flight.
-Copy, Flight.

35:57.491 --> 35:58.909
I'll work 24.

35:59.535 --> 36:01.828
-Okay, Flight, we are in search pattern...
-Gordo, you stay with Tracy.

36:01.912 --> 36:03.705
I'll take Apollo 24 from here.

36:04.039 --> 36:07.501
DSN stations,
we're declaring a spacecraft emergency.

36:07.793 --> 36:09.878
FIDO,
do we have a new trajectory for 25 yet?

36:10.337 --> 36:11.505
Coming up now, Flight.

36:13.298 --> 36:14.550
Trace, you see Molly yet?

36:14.633 --> 36:16.134
Got nothing. Dennis?

36:16.593 --> 36:17.636
No joy here.

36:18.011 --> 36:20.556
Look harder. I'm flashing my light.

36:22.182 --> 36:24.810
-Gotcha.
-Trace, where's Molly in relation to you?

36:24.893 --> 36:27.312
About eleven o'clock. Falling back.

36:27.396 --> 36:29.314
She's like a bright blob.

36:29.398 --> 36:31.525
Can you make out arms, legs, or head?

36:31.608 --> 36:33.902
Negative. Maybe a V shape if I squint.

36:33.986 --> 36:35.737
Good. That gives us a range estimate.

36:36.697 --> 36:39.867
-She's at least a half mile out.
-Puts her about there, Flight.

36:39.950 --> 36:44.079
FIDO, can we get a solid enough track
on Molly to calculate a rescue trajectory?

36:44.371 --> 36:45.372
On it, Flight.

36:45.455 --> 36:48.208
Apollo 24, this is Houston. Do you read?

36:49.501 --> 36:52.713
Houston,
do we have a recovery procedure for Molly?

36:52.796 --> 36:54.173
We're working on it, Trace.

36:54.256 --> 36:58.343
Save your fuel, Stevens. Who knows
what crazy orbit 24 pulled you into?

36:58.719 --> 37:01.054
You're going to need every drop
to align for reentry.

37:01.138 --> 37:02.764
Molly, you keep running your mouth,

37:02.848 --> 37:04.975
and you'll run out of O2
before we can get to you.

37:05.350 --> 37:08.437
Face it, kid, my number's up.
At least the view's amazing.

37:11.231 --> 37:14.067
They see her. She's only a half mile away.

37:14.443 --> 37:16.737
Flying a spacecraft
isn't like driving a car.

37:16.820 --> 37:17.863
It doesn't just go where you point it.

37:17.946 --> 37:20.407
Apollo 24, this is Houston. Do you read?

37:20.782 --> 37:22.201
What's the latest on 24?

37:22.492 --> 37:23.785
Still no comms, Flight.

37:23.869 --> 37:27.664
Radar shows they're still mid-burn. We're
trying to extrapolate a trajectory now.

37:27.956 --> 37:31.001
Houston, we need a recovery procedure.

37:31.502 --> 37:32.753
FIDO, where are my numbers?

37:32.836 --> 37:35.297
Flight, we can't generate them
accurately with what we have.

37:35.380 --> 37:37.841
Everything we come up with will cost them
too much fuel.

37:37.925 --> 37:40.219
They won't have enough to rescue Molly
and come home.

38:00.155 --> 38:01.448
Gordo, tell her it's a no-go.

38:01.532 --> 38:03.992
I'm not losing two astronauts
in a vain attempt to save one.

38:04.076 --> 38:06.119
Have them prep for reentry
on the next orbit.

38:13.001 --> 38:14.294
Negative, Flight.

38:15.128 --> 38:17.130
Not while they've still got
a chance to save her.

38:18.257 --> 38:19.508
I gave you an order.

38:19.591 --> 38:22.469
I'm sorry, Flight. No can do.

38:26.849 --> 38:30.310
Apollo 25, Houston.

38:30.394 --> 38:32.062
That's a no-go on a rescue attempt.

38:32.521 --> 38:34.606
Set up for reentry on the next orbit.

38:34.690 --> 38:35.774
Dennis?

38:35.858 --> 38:36.984
I'm with you, Trace.

38:37.067 --> 38:39.987
Screw that, Houston.
I'm not leaving Molly up here to die.

38:40.404 --> 38:41.822
Not your call, Stevens.

38:42.114 --> 38:43.532
The hell it's not.

38:43.615 --> 38:45.868
I am the pilot in command of this ship

38:45.951 --> 38:48.495
and the final authority as to the safety
of this flight.

38:48.579 --> 38:49.913
I'm going after her.

38:50.330 --> 38:54.543
Forget it, Stevens. I'm not losing my ship
because you wanna play hero.

38:54.626 --> 38:58.088
Yeah, well, it's not your ship
until you come back aboard, Cobb.

38:58.172 --> 39:01.300
And, Houston?
Gordo may be one crazy son of a bitch,

39:01.383 --> 39:03.427
but he knows this spacecraft
better than anybody.

39:03.510 --> 39:06.013
So you put him back on, now.

39:22.779 --> 39:24.156
Don't make me regret this.

39:26.241 --> 39:28.744
Okay, Trace, back with you.

39:28.827 --> 39:30.537
Remember what
I told you about dogfighting?

39:30.621 --> 39:31.997
"Lose sight, lose the fight."

39:32.080 --> 39:34.917
Right. We lose sight now, we lose Molly.

39:35.709 --> 39:38.253
So I want you to mark her position
in the rendezvous window.

39:41.173 --> 39:42.466
Roger that.

39:43.300 --> 39:44.301
She's drifting back.

39:44.718 --> 39:45.761
Okay, Trace.

39:46.512 --> 39:50.807
You need to take manual control
on all axes, and keep Molly centered.

39:51.308 --> 39:53.644
Manual control on all axes.

39:55.103 --> 39:56.855
Good. Here comes the fun part.

39:56.939 --> 39:59.858
I want you to get a good LVLH REFSMMAT

39:59.942 --> 40:02.736
and keep pumpin' them pulses
on your velocity vector

40:02.819 --> 40:04.655
while you're still pointin'
your nose at her.

40:04.738 --> 40:07.282
Looks like thruster quad D isn't firing.

40:07.366 --> 40:09.368
Damn. I wondered why the ship
feels all over the map.

40:09.451 --> 40:11.286
Probably got dinged when we hit 24.

40:11.370 --> 40:13.664
All right.
How we gonna pull this off, Gordo?

40:13.747 --> 40:15.999
Close the helium to the affected quad
and secure it.

40:16.291 --> 40:18.126
Keep eyes on Molly, Trace. I got it.

40:18.210 --> 40:20.462
Control inputs are gonna keep changing,

40:20.546 --> 40:22.422
but just don't do anything dumb,
and you got this.

40:22.506 --> 40:24.550
What makes you think I'd do anything dumb?

40:25.259 --> 40:26.552
You married me, didn't ya?

40:26.635 --> 40:27.886
Roger that.

40:29.513 --> 40:31.139
What's the latest on 24?

40:33.225 --> 40:34.601
Apollo 24, Houston.

40:34.685 --> 40:36.103
Trace, where's Molly now?

40:36.520 --> 40:38.939
Still got her in the center,
but she's getting smaller.

40:39.398 --> 40:40.524
Just a dot now.

40:41.483 --> 40:42.818
Jesus, it's not working.

40:43.235 --> 40:46.321
-That's right where we want her.
-She's moving farther away from us.

40:46.738 --> 40:51.243
25's posigrade thrust will
make them slow down at apogee

40:51.326 --> 40:52.452
and take them right to her.

40:52.536 --> 40:53.787
If it works.

40:54.538 --> 40:55.956
Timing is everything.

40:56.456 --> 40:58.417
Especially because
they're heading into night.

40:59.001 --> 41:02.462
GUIDO, INCO, anything on Apollo 24?

41:02.546 --> 41:05.382
We'll have a pretty good guess of their
trajectory in about two minutes, Flight.

41:05.465 --> 41:07.134
Still nothing from their comms.

41:07.217 --> 41:08.760
Give me the fuel levels on 25.

41:08.844 --> 41:11.013
They're burning like crazy.
Twenty-two percent.

41:12.472 --> 41:13.807
Lost you, 25.

41:13.891 --> 41:16.018
My O2's down to five minutes.

41:16.101 --> 41:18.312
If you're going to do something,
now's the perfect time.

41:18.395 --> 41:19.396
Hang in there, Molly.

41:19.479 --> 41:21.899
Nineteen percent fuel, Trace.
Dropping fast.

41:21.982 --> 41:24.151
That goes below 15, we are screwed.

41:24.234 --> 41:25.235
Roger that.

41:29.489 --> 41:32.743
Oh, shit, I lost her.
Please tell me you have her, Dennis.

41:32.826 --> 41:34.036
No joy here.

41:34.995 --> 41:36.538
Molly, where are you?

41:36.622 --> 41:40.375
Same place I was.
Goddamn flashlight battery ran out.

41:40.751 --> 41:42.044
Oh, my God.

41:45.631 --> 41:49.635
Tell me that we are not going to lose
Molly Cobb to a dead flashlight battery.

41:50.802 --> 41:55.057
Gordo, tell 25 to turn on
their rendezvous beacon.

41:56.141 --> 41:58.268
Trace, light yourself up.

41:58.352 --> 41:59.770
Hell yeah.

42:00.395 --> 42:01.855
Rendezvous beacon on.

42:01.939 --> 42:03.607
All right, Molly. You see us now?

42:03.690 --> 42:06.235
Got you. Two pulses, minus-Y.

42:06.568 --> 42:07.736
Roger that.

42:11.240 --> 42:12.407
I still can't see, Molly.

42:13.867 --> 42:15.369
Jesus Christ, trust me.

42:16.078 --> 42:19.122
One more pulse, minus-Y,
and that'll bring you around to me.

42:19.665 --> 42:20.832
Roger that.

42:25.504 --> 42:27.673
You took your sweet-ass time.

42:32.594 --> 42:34.012
Welcome back.

42:45.941 --> 42:49.736
Okay, Trace, you're close enough
to blow off orbital mechanics.

42:50.362 --> 42:52.447
Just drive right up,
throw her in the back seat.

42:52.990 --> 42:54.491
Roger, Gordo.

42:55.659 --> 42:56.952
Thank you.

42:57.452 --> 42:59.121
Well, it was all you, babe.

42:59.538 --> 43:01.123
Not bad for a rookie.

43:03.625 --> 43:05.294
Okay. Well done, people.

43:06.420 --> 43:08.297
But we still have another ship in trouble.

43:10.716 --> 43:12.926
Apollo 24, this is Houston. Do you read?

43:14.011 --> 43:15.220
Apollo 24, Houston.

43:17.139 --> 43:20.350
Flight, just got the trajectory projection
for Apollo 24.

43:20.893 --> 43:23.896
Still no telemetry.
So we don't know if they're dead or alive.

43:24.605 --> 43:26.523
Are they still on track for the moon?

43:26.982 --> 43:28.692
They'll miss by a thousand miles.

43:32.362 --> 43:35.032
Apollo 24, this is Houston. Do you read?

43:37.159 --> 43:38.869
Apollo 24, Houston.

43:41.371 --> 43:44.124
Apollo 24, this is Houston. Do you read?

43:46.502 --> 43:48.462
Apollo 24, come in.

44:08.440 --> 44:10.234
Who might that be?

44:10.317 --> 44:13.487
Fuller Brush man? Avon lady?

44:23.455 --> 44:25.165
What's the matter there, Ivan?

44:25.249 --> 44:28.335
Your rover break down or something?
I wonder how that happened.

44:30.838 --> 44:34.508
Not enough O2 to walk back to base, huh?
Well, that sucks.

44:38.178 --> 44:40.264
Now you come in peace, do you?

44:41.557 --> 44:44.810
Well, in that case, come on in.

46:18.028 --> 46:19.821
You wanna come on in, Ivan?

46:21.406 --> 46:22.908
Well, come on in.
