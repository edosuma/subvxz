<i>Previously</i>
<i>on</i> when calls the heart...

00:00.001 --> 00:00.429
<i>Pleasure to meet</i>
<i>you, miss leveaux.</i>

00:00.001 --> 00:04.136
What brings you here?

00:04.138 --> 00:07.639
You barely know
this elizabeth thatcher.

00:07.641 --> 00:09.441
This is war.
I'm going to ruin you.

00:09.443 --> 00:11.310
<i>I received an offer</i>
<i>of a teaching position</i>

00:11.312 --> 00:15.247
I'm staying here.
This is where I belong.

00:21.221 --> 00:22.554
[footsteps]

00:22.556 --> 00:23.756
Is it true

00:23.758 --> 00:25.624
You're taking another
teaching job back east?

00:28.328 --> 00:30.396
Word spreads fast
in this town.

00:30.398 --> 00:33.198
I have an offer.
Nothing more.

00:33.200 --> 00:36.201
My family's doing.
They're worried about me.

00:36.203 --> 00:37.469
Well, that's understandable,

00:37.471 --> 00:39.371
With everything
that's gone on here.

00:39.373 --> 00:41.607
And going on.

00:44.778 --> 00:47.246
I've been thinking
a lot about this.

00:47.248 --> 00:49.281
And you and rosemary,
you have a history.

00:50.617 --> 00:52.351
And you have
a great deal in common.

00:52.353 --> 00:53.519
That's not true.

00:53.521 --> 00:56.155
From what I can see,
it is.

00:56.157 --> 00:57.322
Elizabeth...

00:57.324 --> 00:58.590
A man doesn't
propose to a woman

00:58.592 --> 01:00.125
And get over it so easily.

01:01.295 --> 01:06.465
To think long and hard
about your feelings

01:06.467 --> 01:09.401
Before you make a decision
you might regret.

01:09.403 --> 01:11.737
If that's what you want,
then I will.

01:13.373 --> 01:15.641
It is.

01:17.277 --> 01:18.644
Is that a squid?

01:21.548 --> 01:22.614
[defensively]: It's a comet.

01:22.616 --> 01:24.216
A comet? Uh...

01:26.119 --> 01:26.752
May I?

01:29.489 --> 01:31.657
Let's see.

01:32.692 --> 01:35.461
You-- [sighs]

01:35.463 --> 01:36.495
Comets...

01:36.497 --> 01:38.831
Have tails, right?

01:38.833 --> 01:41.533
Actually, it's just
evaporated materials and dust.

01:41.535 --> 01:44.403
Well, let's call it a tail.

01:44.405 --> 01:47.139
Thank you,
mr. Van gogh.

01:47.141 --> 01:48.273
[chalk scraping board]

01:56.116 --> 01:57.749
I can add a constellation
if you'd like?

01:57.751 --> 01:59.251
How about
you remove a constable

01:59.253 --> 02:02.454
What? So you can take credit
for my chalk work?

02:02.456 --> 02:03.522
[door opening]

02:05.325 --> 02:06.458
Good morning, children!

02:06.460 --> 02:07.893
Be sure to admire

02:07.895 --> 02:10.596
Mountie jack's artwork
on your way to your seats.

02:10.598 --> 02:12.331
He enjoys
compliments.

02:12.333 --> 02:13.832
Unlike miss thatcher,

02:13.834 --> 02:16.201
Who is uncomfortable
with compliments,

02:16.203 --> 02:18.303
Even though she's quite
deserving of them.

02:20.140 --> 02:22.541
School is in session,
mr. Thornton.

02:22.543 --> 02:24.743
If you'd like to speak,

02:24.745 --> 02:26.745
Please raise your hand
like all of the other children.

02:26.747 --> 02:28.313
[laughter]

02:32.519 --> 02:33.652
May I be excused?

02:33.654 --> 02:35.354
Yes, you may.

02:35.356 --> 02:37.322
Thank you, miss thatcher.

02:44.898 --> 02:47.466
All right.
Shall we begin?

02:47.468 --> 02:48.767
Yeah!

02:48.769 --> 02:50.903
[laughter]

02:50.905 --> 02:52.437
Now, when we think
of astronomy,

02:52.439 --> 02:55.307
We think of planets
and stars

02:55.309 --> 02:56.608
And things far away.

02:56.610 --> 02:58.343
But every 75 years,

02:58.345 --> 03:00.779
Something special passes
over the night sky.

03:00.781 --> 03:03.749
It's called halley's comet.

03:03.751 --> 03:05.584
Now, sometime soon,

03:05.586 --> 03:07.519
We'll be able
to look up in the sky

03:07.521 --> 03:10.222
And see a fiery comet
passing over coal valley

03:10.224 --> 03:11.223
As it orbits the sun.

03:11.225 --> 03:12.658
Wow!

03:12.660 --> 03:13.792
When will we know
to look up?

03:13.794 --> 03:16.595
Well, we won't, exactly.

03:16.597 --> 03:19.298
Comets aren't like stagecoaches,
they don't run on a schedule.

03:19.300 --> 03:22.301
So I suggest
we all keep our eyes out,

03:22.303 --> 03:25.437
Which means every night,
before you go to bed,

03:25.439 --> 03:29.408
I want you to look up at the sky
toward the mountains.

03:30.743 --> 03:32.644
Can my father see it
from heaven?

03:32.646 --> 03:34.780
Oh...

03:35.815 --> 03:37.516
I'm sure that he can.

03:37.518 --> 03:39.418
And all
the other fathers--

03:39.420 --> 03:40.452
Can they see it?

03:40.454 --> 03:42.321
All of our loved ones
we've lost

03:42.323 --> 03:43.589
Are watching over us...

03:43.591 --> 03:45.824
Just as god is.

03:45.826 --> 03:48.694
We can feel them
all around us,

03:48.696 --> 03:52.364
Their love
and their guidance...

03:52.366 --> 03:53.865
And that's not going to change.

03:56.836 --> 03:59.438
All right, children.
Let's return to the skies.

04:01.708 --> 04:04.610
Can you imagine a time

04:04.612 --> 04:08.480
When man might travel
into outer space?

04:08.482 --> 04:09.915
Why not a woman?

04:11.751 --> 04:13.552
Sorry
for interrupting.

04:13.554 --> 04:14.853
I overslept.

04:14.855 --> 04:17.623
Oh, dear!

04:17.625 --> 04:20.792
I can't remember the last time
I saw such a sad audience.

04:20.794 --> 04:22.761
This isn't an audience,
miss leveaux.

04:22.763 --> 04:23.829
What is it, then?

04:23.831 --> 04:26.565
It's a classroom.

04:26.567 --> 04:29.401
And who is to say a teacher
can't be entertaining?

04:29.403 --> 04:31.837
Oh! So you're a teacher now,

04:31.839 --> 04:34.439
Along with all of
your other occupations?

04:34.441 --> 04:37.376
Well, I did teach music
for a spell in new york.

04:37.378 --> 04:40.746
New york!
What's it like there?

04:40.748 --> 04:42.781
In the evening,

04:42.783 --> 04:47.486
Times square is filled
with music and lights

04:47.488 --> 04:48.654
And people,

04:48.656 --> 04:49.688
Even at midnight!

04:49.690 --> 04:52.858
And the buildings
are so tall,

04:52.860 --> 04:55.294
They touch the sky!

04:55.296 --> 04:56.528
Which is exactly
what we're studying--

04:56.530 --> 04:58.997
The sky.

04:58.999 --> 05:00.365
And we really
should get back to it.

05:00.367 --> 05:03.468
Oh. But I was just about
to tell them all

05:03.470 --> 05:05.437
About coney island.

05:05.439 --> 05:08.640
-Tell us!
-[overlapping]: Yeah!

05:08.642 --> 05:09.775
[laughs briefly]

05:09.777 --> 05:11.410
Miss thatcher?

05:12.645 --> 05:14.946
[children]:
Please, miss thatcher?

05:18.618 --> 05:21.353
[♪]

05:30.029 --> 05:31.797
I feel like
I've been replaced.

05:31.799 --> 05:33.699
Oh. That's not possible.

05:33.701 --> 05:36.001
I'm afraid halley
doesn't stand a chance

05:36.003 --> 05:37.803
Against
rosemary's comet.

05:37.805 --> 05:38.870
Don't comets
burn out?

05:38.872 --> 05:40.872
Not before setting fire

05:40.874 --> 05:42.908
To everything
in their path.

05:42.910 --> 05:45.544
Speaking
of setting fires--

05:45.546 --> 05:47.012
Is it my imagination,

05:47.014 --> 05:49.414
Or do you get prettier
with every passing day?

05:49.416 --> 05:50.882
It's your
imagination.

05:50.884 --> 05:52.617
And a little makeup.

05:52.619 --> 05:54.586
[laughs]
and that hair...

05:54.588 --> 05:55.887
And this dress.

05:55.889 --> 05:57.856
And flowers
in the cafe.

05:57.858 --> 05:59.458
A gift from bill.

05:59.460 --> 06:00.759
He comes in
so frequently,

06:00.761 --> 06:02.761
He thought it might
brighten the place up.

06:02.763 --> 06:05.097
I'm sure that's
the only reason.

06:05.099 --> 06:07.799
Maybe you're not
just mourning the past,

06:07.801 --> 06:09.768
But looking toward
the future as well?

06:09.770 --> 06:11.703
[sighs] perhaps.

06:11.705 --> 06:13.905
But we can't forget
why he's here.

06:15.541 --> 06:16.875
Wyatt!

06:16.877 --> 06:18.744
Hello, miss thatcher,
mrs. Stanton.

06:18.746 --> 06:19.745
Hello, wyatt.

06:19.747 --> 06:20.879
You're working
on a Sunday?

06:20.881 --> 06:22.981
My family needs the money.

06:22.983 --> 06:24.850
I took over
wendell backus's shift.

06:24.852 --> 06:25.917
He's sick.

06:25.919 --> 06:27.419
That's very kind
of you.

06:27.421 --> 06:28.687
The air down there's
hard to breathe

06:28.689 --> 06:30.856
For some of the older miners.

06:30.858 --> 06:32.958
I came to return these
before my shift.

06:32.960 --> 06:34.960
Thank you.
Do you need more?

06:34.962 --> 06:36.928
I haven't had much time
to read lately, ma'am.

06:36.930 --> 06:39.531
Well,
whenever you do,

06:39.533 --> 06:40.932
You are welcome
to my library.

06:40.934 --> 06:42.768
Thank you.

06:51.677 --> 06:54.479
These fragments are from
the point of explosion.

06:54.481 --> 06:55.747
The sediment burns

06:55.749 --> 06:57.949
Show the excessive level
of methane in the shaft.

06:57.951 --> 06:58.984
Which means those men

06:58.986 --> 07:00.752
Were sent into
a death trap.

07:00.754 --> 07:02.587
It's looking that way.

07:03.856 --> 07:05.724
Okay, thank you all

07:05.726 --> 07:07.826
For coming out today
on your Sunday afternoon.

07:07.828 --> 07:09.027
We're eager to know

07:09.029 --> 07:10.729
Why you gathered
us here, mr. Miller.

07:10.731 --> 07:11.930
Yes. Uh...

07:11.932 --> 07:14.499
When I lost my leg,

07:14.501 --> 07:16.768
I thought
I'd lost everything...

07:19.172 --> 07:21.506
But what I really lost
was my spirit.

07:21.508 --> 07:24.776
Now, I can't work
in that mine anymore,

07:24.778 --> 07:28.880
But I believe I've found
another way to be useful.

07:28.882 --> 07:30.982
Now, as some of you know,

07:30.984 --> 07:34.019
I used to be a pretty good
with a hammer and nail,

07:34.021 --> 07:37.088
So I took the liberty

07:37.090 --> 07:39.791
Of drawing up some plans...

07:39.793 --> 07:43.028
For a new church
and schoolhouse.

07:43.030 --> 07:44.996
[quiet gasping]

07:44.998 --> 07:48.834
Now, if we can just raise
a little money among us

07:48.836 --> 07:49.835
For supplies,

07:49.837 --> 07:51.236
I can build them,

07:51.238 --> 07:54.139
And help bring coal valley
back to where it was--

07:54.141 --> 07:57.042
A town with a...
With a proper church,

07:57.044 --> 07:59.811
And a...And a school
that isn't inside a saloon.

08:03.950 --> 08:07.486
This is a wonderful
idea, but...

08:07.488 --> 08:11.056
I'm afraid no one
has much to spare.

08:11.058 --> 08:12.624
I know I don't.

08:12.626 --> 08:14.693
I understand,
being in the same predicament,

08:14.695 --> 08:18.063
But we have to start somewhere.

08:19.232 --> 08:20.599
[gowen]:
I think mr. Miller's plan

08:20.601 --> 08:22.133
Is exactly
what this town needs.

08:25.605 --> 08:27.639
And I'm sure
that the company would be...

08:27.641 --> 08:30.709
More than happy to make
a sizeable donation.

08:30.711 --> 08:33.144
What a magnanimous gesture,
mr. Gowen.

08:33.146 --> 08:33.979
Well, thank you,
mrs. Ramsey,

08:33.981 --> 08:36.014
But a magnanimous gesture

08:36.016 --> 08:39.885
Would be to donate
the entirety of the money

08:39.887 --> 08:41.920
And to pay
for mr. Miller's labor.

08:41.922 --> 08:45.190
Unfortunately,
our reserves are tied up

08:45.192 --> 08:47.993
Defending against
this frivolous investigation.

08:49.529 --> 08:54.199
No investigation is frivolous
when 46 men are dead.

08:57.169 --> 08:59.037
An unspeakable tragedy.

08:59.039 --> 09:01.172
Yet I do have
to ask myself

09:01.174 --> 09:05.243
If perhaps mr. Avery's judgment
may be clouded...

09:05.245 --> 09:06.678
What with
your recent friendship.

09:08.014 --> 09:09.981
Your insults
will not silence me,

09:09.983 --> 09:12.083
Nor will your money.

09:12.085 --> 09:13.785
[huffs]

09:13.787 --> 09:18.123
Do we want to build
our town back up with a bribe?

09:18.125 --> 09:19.958
If we take his money,

09:19.960 --> 09:23.695
Then the company will own
more of us than they already do.

09:23.697 --> 09:25.697
The company already
owns us, abigail.

09:25.699 --> 09:26.831
The houses we live in,

09:26.833 --> 09:29.134
The streets we walk on,
even your cafe,

09:29.136 --> 09:30.869
Right?

09:30.871 --> 09:32.804
At least we would have
a proper place to worship.

09:32.806 --> 09:37.042
Without miners traipsing
through it at all hours.

09:37.044 --> 09:40.111
I believe that children
can learn anywhere,

09:40.113 --> 09:42.914
Be it in a schoolhouse
or in a saloon.

09:42.916 --> 09:45.016
Abraham lincoln
learned in a log cabin.

09:45.018 --> 09:48.053
Unfortunately,
your replacement may disagree.

09:48.055 --> 09:49.588
My replacement?

09:49.590 --> 09:52.924
Well, I assume...
Since you're leaving us.

09:54.627 --> 09:56.628
Is that true?

09:56.630 --> 09:57.696
No.

09:57.698 --> 09:59.998
That is, it's true

10:00.000 --> 10:02.801
I received an offer
of a position, but I haven't--

10:02.803 --> 10:04.703
When were you planning
on telling us, miss thatcher?

10:04.705 --> 10:05.870
Obviously
she wasn't.

10:05.872 --> 10:07.105
Who's gonna teach us?

10:07.107 --> 10:08.840
Oh, james, please.

10:08.842 --> 10:10.208
Nothing's been decided at all.

10:10.210 --> 10:11.843
You only just got here
a little while ago.

10:11.845 --> 10:13.011
You said you'd watch
the comet with us.

10:13.013 --> 10:16.014
And I will, james.

10:26.959 --> 10:27.892
[grunting]

10:37.036 --> 10:39.170
[gasps weakly and groans]

10:46.947 --> 10:49.047
Bill!
Are you all right?

10:49.049 --> 10:50.315
What happened?

10:50.317 --> 10:52.217
Had a little unwanted visit
out at the mine.

10:52.219 --> 10:54.986
They took my forensic kit
with all the evidence.

10:54.988 --> 10:56.054
Did you get
a look at them?

10:56.056 --> 10:57.956
They had masks.

10:57.958 --> 10:59.224
Okay.

10:59.226 --> 11:01.159
-You take care of him, will you?
-Yes. Of course.

11:01.161 --> 11:02.293
I'm going with you.

11:02.295 --> 11:04.062
You're in no condition.

11:04.064 --> 11:05.830
I'm still your superior.

11:05.832 --> 11:08.033
Well...

11:08.035 --> 11:09.734
I'll make a note of
that in my report.

11:12.205 --> 11:15.240
This cut behind
your ear looks very deep.

11:15.242 --> 11:16.708
I think you might
need some stitches.

that I'll go to

a fuss over me.

You good with a needle?

11:22.816 --> 11:24.382
I've made all
my own curtains.

11:24.384 --> 11:27.085
Well, how about
sewing a person?

11:28.387 --> 11:30.922
Well, we're about
to find out.

11:32.258 --> 11:33.792
Ahem.

11:33.794 --> 11:34.859

Woof.

You. How thrilling.

11:47.708 --> 11:50.108
Well, you had better
get used to me.

11:54.313 --> 11:58.216
Fine. Be that way.

11:58.218 --> 11:59.284
Hmm!

12:06.092 --> 12:08.393
Hmm...

12:13.299 --> 12:17.869
And you'd better
get used to me too.

12:36.122 --> 12:38.189
Jack.

12:38.191 --> 12:39.991
Did you find them?

12:39.993 --> 12:41.259
The trail went cold.

12:41.261 --> 12:43.862
Too dark to be searching.

12:45.464 --> 12:46.931
Well, I'm glad
you're back safely.

12:46.933 --> 12:49.300
Were you worried
I wouldn't be?

12:49.302 --> 12:51.302
No.

12:51.304 --> 12:54.172
Yet you're out here in
the middle of the night waiting.

12:54.174 --> 12:56.541
If you must know,

12:56.543 --> 13:00.278
I was just watching
for halley's comet.

13:00.280 --> 13:02.213
Halley's comet.

13:03.382 --> 13:05.350
Do you know how many times
I've heard that excuse?

13:10.990 --> 13:12.891
Maybe I was a little worried.

13:12.893 --> 13:14.159
Just a little?

13:14.161 --> 13:15.226
Don't push it.

13:15.228 --> 13:16.861
[chuckles]

13:18.063 --> 13:21.399
I heard what happened
at the town meeting.

13:21.401 --> 13:23.134
I'm sorry.

13:23.136 --> 13:25.336
Thank you.

13:25.338 --> 13:28.206
I want you to know...

13:28.208 --> 13:30.975
Whether you decide
to leave or stay,

13:30.977 --> 13:33.111
I-I'll support you.

13:33.113 --> 13:35.246
You deserve to teach
in a real school,

13:35.248 --> 13:38.950
Elizabeth, not a...
Not a saloon.

13:38.952 --> 13:42.020
But I-I have faith that
that will happen here

13:42.022 --> 13:43.421
Sooner than later.

13:43.423 --> 13:46.191
The schoolhouse
doesn't really matter to me.

13:46.193 --> 13:47.292
It's the children.

13:50.362 --> 13:52.096
This town needs you, elizabeth.

13:54.300 --> 13:56.367
Not just this town.

14:03.909 --> 14:05.376
It's getting late.

14:05.378 --> 14:08.146
I should probably turn in.

14:09.114 --> 14:10.982
Of course.

14:27.399 --> 14:29.367
Good morning,
wyatt.

14:29.369 --> 14:31.369
Good morning, miss thatcher.
Do you have a minute?

14:31.371 --> 14:33.338
Of course!

14:33.340 --> 14:36.441
I wanted
to show you something.

14:36.443 --> 14:39.444
How does it...Work?

14:42.414 --> 14:44.482
Oh, my goodness.

14:50.122 --> 14:52.123
Oh! It's wonderful!
Where did you get this?

14:52.125 --> 14:53.258
[clicks off]

14:53.260 --> 14:54.259
I made it.

14:54.261 --> 14:56.361
You did?

14:56.363 --> 14:59.097
I got the idea
from your physics books,

14:59.099 --> 15:01.299
And the phonograph.

15:01.301 --> 15:04.102
If I could create
a bigger version,

15:04.104 --> 15:06.070
It could help circulate
the air in the mine,

15:06.072 --> 15:07.505
Help people
breathe better.

15:07.507 --> 15:09.440
Maybe even prevent
another disaster

15:09.442 --> 15:11.442
By venting
the dust and gas.

15:11.444 --> 15:13.611
And the blades
are made out of wood

15:13.613 --> 15:15.313
So that there's no risk
for a spark.

15:15.315 --> 15:18.283
I wasn't wrong about you,
was I?

15:18.285 --> 15:21.552
You are really quite
an extraordinary young man.

15:21.554 --> 15:23.121
Have you shown this to anyone?

15:23.123 --> 15:24.322
Just my mother.

15:24.324 --> 15:26.224
Made her cry.

15:26.226 --> 15:27.592
She was upset?

15:27.594 --> 15:30.128
No. Happy.
Does that make sense?

15:30.130 --> 15:32.297
Oh.

15:32.299 --> 15:37.402
Sometimes we women
cry when we're happy,

15:37.404 --> 15:39.370
Sometimes we cry
when we're sad,

15:39.372 --> 15:41.372
And sometimes
for no reason at all.

15:41.374 --> 15:43.441
Crying can be good,

15:43.443 --> 15:45.543
Bad,
or mean nothing at all?

15:45.545 --> 15:47.011
Exactly.

15:47.013 --> 15:48.546
I may know science,

15:48.548 --> 15:50.248
But I'll never
understand women.

15:52.085 --> 15:53.484
I think most men
would agree with you.

15:53.486 --> 15:55.186
Now, then.

15:55.188 --> 15:58.456
I'd like to telegram
my father's patent attorney

15:58.458 --> 15:59.490
About your fan.

15:59.492 --> 16:01.526
If you'd like
to leave it here,

16:01.528 --> 16:04.295
The constable can take
a photograph for us.

16:04.297 --> 16:05.496
Thank you,
miss thatcher.

16:35.260 --> 16:37.562

16:37.564 --> 16:40.765
Well, it appears as if
you've been injured.

16:40.767 --> 16:42.500
Don't bother
acting surprised.

16:42.502 --> 16:45.303
I just wanted to let you know,
your threats won't stop me.

16:45.305 --> 16:46.704
Oh, I'm not surprised.

16:46.706 --> 16:50.108
And was that
another unwarranted accusation?

16:50.110 --> 16:52.110
What am I guilty of now?

16:52.112 --> 16:53.578
Well, if my hunch is right,

16:53.580 --> 16:56.314
Assault and theft
by your henchmen.

16:56.316 --> 16:57.715
I don't have henchmen.

16:57.717 --> 17:00.385
And I don't control
the people in this town.

17:00.387 --> 17:01.619
I beg to differ.

17:01.621 --> 17:03.121
If you close this mine,

17:03.123 --> 17:04.555
The men here
won't get paid.

17:04.557 --> 17:06.391
And if they don't
get paid,

17:06.393 --> 17:09.227
Then their wives can't
put food on the table.

17:09.229 --> 17:11.062
That would be
motivation enough

17:11.064 --> 17:12.697
For a lot of
people in this town

17:12.699 --> 17:15.666
I know it was you,
and I mean to prove it.

17:15.668 --> 17:17.568
Just like I'm going to prove

17:17.570 --> 17:19.737

that shaft was unsafe.

Ah, that'll open
a whole can of worms.

to catch something pretty big.

17:31.584 --> 17:33.317

17:33.319 --> 17:35.753
That all you're gonna do
is further hurt abigail stanton.

very fondly.

Would hate
for that to change.

You best be very careful
right now, gowen.

arresting mr. Gowen,

your hands off him.

you do have henchmen.

of coal valley,

24:09.048 --> 24:12.650
Who have all become
very important to me.

24:12.652 --> 24:15.686
Especially, uh,
one person in particular.

24:15.688 --> 24:16.887
Thank you, jack.

24:16.889 --> 24:19.890
And your generosity,

24:19.892 --> 24:22.026
Well, has made me
all the more fond of you.

24:22.028 --> 24:24.028
[gowen]: May I offer
my own words of gratitude

24:24.030 --> 24:25.095
To the constable?

24:26.698 --> 24:31.469
Not only have you made
our town a safer place,

24:31.471 --> 24:35.039
But I think we can all agree,
a better place.

24:35.041 --> 24:37.908
Now, since we're all
gathered here together,

24:37.910 --> 24:39.844
I have an announcement
to make.

24:39.846 --> 24:42.780
Unfortunately,
it is not a happy one,

24:42.782 --> 24:46.116
But I do believe it is something
that needs to be said.

24:46.118 --> 24:50.988
This is mr. Gentry.
He is the company lawyer,

24:50.990 --> 24:53.023
And he is in possession
of documents

24:53.025 --> 24:54.992
Which, now, I did not
want to bring to light,

24:54.994 --> 24:56.760
But it would seem

24:56.762 --> 24:58.529
That mrs. Stanton
has forced my hand.

24:58.531 --> 25:00.698
What hand would
that be, mr. Gowen?

25:00.700 --> 25:03.067
The one that write
checks to silence us,

25:03.069 --> 25:05.569
Or the one that ordered
the attack on mr. Avery?

25:05.571 --> 25:07.972
Does mr. Avery not
wish to speak for himself?

25:07.974 --> 25:09.940
Mr. Avery has gone
to get the circuit judge

25:09.942 --> 25:11.542
To bring you to justice.

25:11.544 --> 25:13.277
Well, that is good news.

25:13.279 --> 25:16.647
But the judge will not
be presiding over my trial.

25:19.618 --> 25:21.218
These documents prove

25:21.220 --> 25:24.121
That the guilt
for the terrible tragedy

25:24.123 --> 25:26.023
Which befell our town

25:26.025 --> 25:27.825
Lies with one man--

25:29.961 --> 25:31.562
Noah stanton.

25:33.832 --> 25:35.900
Your husband
was the superintendent.

25:35.902 --> 25:38.802
It was his decision
to lead those men into the mine,

25:38.804 --> 25:41.839
Knowing full well
conditions were unsafe.

25:41.841 --> 25:43.607
Noah would've never
done something like that.

25:43.609 --> 25:45.576
You are way out of line, gowen.

25:45.578 --> 25:48.112
Constable, let's let
the judge decide that.

25:48.114 --> 25:49.647
I started this investigation,
not mrs. Stanton,

25:49.649 --> 25:51.148
And I'm gonna see

25:51.150 --> 25:52.917
That it's finished
based on evidence--

25:52.919 --> 25:54.852
Not hearsay
and finger-pointing.

25:54.854 --> 25:57.221
I know that you
want to believe

25:57.223 --> 25:58.856
What mrs. Stanton
is saying.

25:58.858 --> 26:00.925
She's kind,

26:00.927 --> 26:02.793
And charming,

26:02.795 --> 26:06.830
And she makes the best biscuits
that any of us have ever tasted,

26:06.832 --> 26:08.966
But her husband
was a risk-taker,

26:08.968 --> 26:10.801
And his reputation
preceded him.

26:10.803 --> 26:13.904
That's why he was fired
by the lee mining company

26:13.906 --> 26:15.873
Prior to his arrival
in coal valley.

26:15.875 --> 26:16.807
He wasn't fired.

26:18.176 --> 26:20.611
He quit because
the working conditions

26:20.613 --> 26:21.679
Were deplorable.

26:21.681 --> 26:23.113
That's not
what his records show.

26:23.115 --> 26:24.848
Then those records
are fabricated,

26:24.850 --> 26:27.184
You know
that your husband's salary

26:27.186 --> 26:29.186
Was associated with
the amount of coal

26:29.188 --> 26:31.689
That his men dug out
of that mine every day.

26:31.691 --> 26:34.258
That shaft carried
a very rich deposit.

26:34.260 --> 26:36.860
Noah didn't care about money.
You can ask anyone here.

26:36.862 --> 26:39.296
You may not have known,
but your husband was in debt.

26:39.298 --> 26:43.033
Deeply in debt, I'm afraid.

26:43.035 --> 26:46.370
Desperation can cause a man
to take a great many risks.

26:46.372 --> 26:50.841
Noah stanton
was desperate for money.

26:50.843 --> 26:52.910
Desperate enough
to lead his men,

26:52.912 --> 26:55.045
And his own son,
into that mine,

26:55.047 --> 26:58.148
And to their graves.

26:58.150 --> 27:01.719
Good people of coal valley...

27:01.721 --> 27:05.623
What message was
noah stanton sending

27:05.625 --> 27:09.660
When we found this
after the disaster?

27:09.662 --> 27:13.230
What was once
a symbol of hope...

27:15.800 --> 27:17.935
May now be
an admission of guilt.

27:20.205 --> 27:23.874
[abigail]: You all knew noah.

27:23.876 --> 27:25.909
There wasn't anything
he wouldn't have done

27:25.911 --> 27:28.746
For any of you.

27:43.061 --> 27:45.029
The truth
will come out.

27:45.031 --> 27:46.230
Rest assured,

27:46.232 --> 27:48.032
Gowen will not succeed.

27:48.034 --> 27:50.034
Oh, I'm afraid
he already has.

27:50.036 --> 27:52.970
Did you see the way they
were all looking at me?

27:52.972 --> 27:56.273
You'll have your say in court,
and they'll hear you then.

27:56.275 --> 27:57.841
Oh, I pray you're right,
elizabeth,

27:57.843 --> 27:59.443
Because right now
I feel

27:59.445 --> 28:01.979
As if I'm losing everything
all over again.

28:03.148 --> 28:04.782
You won't lose me.

28:06.785 --> 28:08.018
You're a true friend.

28:08.020 --> 28:09.386
[chuckles]

28:09.388 --> 28:10.788
Perhaps the only one
I've got.

28:10.790 --> 28:12.122
No.

28:12.124 --> 28:14.692
You have many friends.
You'll see.

28:14.694 --> 28:16.060
They'll be standing
alongside you

28:16.062 --> 28:17.161
When the time comes.

28:17.163 --> 28:19.296
I'm not so sure.

28:21.933 --> 28:25.803
Noah did talk
of buying a claim.

28:25.805 --> 28:28.272
He wanted to start
his own business.

28:30.008 --> 28:31.275
Well, that doesn't
prove anything.

28:31.277 --> 28:33.010
Unless it caused him

28:33.012 --> 28:35.813
To do something
he wouldn't normally do.

28:37.749 --> 28:39.817
I didn't get to meet noah.

28:40.919 --> 28:43.754
But from everything
I've heard,

28:43.756 --> 28:45.856
He was a good and decent man.

28:45.858 --> 28:48.225
You must continue
to believe that.

28:56.167 --> 28:58.736
[horse whinnies]

29:01.339 --> 29:03.107
The judge got
stuck on a case

29:03.109 --> 29:04.775
In cooperville.

29:04.777 --> 29:06.009
He'll be in on
tomorrow's stagecoach.

29:06.011 --> 29:08.045
Judge farrell, I'm hoping?

29:08.047 --> 29:09.780
I'm afraid not.
Judge black.

29:09.782 --> 29:11.849
-Jedidiah black?
-Yes.

29:11.851 --> 29:13.884
I know him
only too well.

29:13.886 --> 29:15.953
Tell me.
Are the stories about him true?

29:17.856 --> 29:19.356
He once sentenced
a man to hang.

29:19.358 --> 29:22.459
The man jumped the rail in court
to attack him,

29:22.461 --> 29:24.862
And he pulled out his pistol
and shot him right there.

29:24.864 --> 29:27.131
In his defense,
as quick as he is with a pistol,

29:27.133 --> 29:28.532
He's just as quick with a gavel.

29:28.534 --> 29:30.868
Well, let's hope it's swinging
in the right direction.

29:30.870 --> 29:33.504
Last night, gowen managed
to sway half the town

29:33.506 --> 29:35.239
That noah stanton's to blame
for the explosion.

29:37.142 --> 29:39.109
I'm going
to see abigail.

29:41.279 --> 29:43.247
[sighing]

29:47.152 --> 29:49.119
[door opens]

29:51.222 --> 29:53.023
How are you?

29:54.325 --> 29:55.959
Well, I've been better,

29:55.961 --> 29:59.229
And I've been worse.

29:59.231 --> 30:01.365
I heard what happened
with gowen.

30:01.367 --> 30:02.966
I'm sorry I wasn't here.

30:04.269 --> 30:06.036
Would you like to sit down?

30:06.038 --> 30:09.273
As you can see,
you have your choice of tables.

30:09.275 --> 30:10.307
When the truth
comes out,

30:10.309 --> 30:11.542
And it will,

30:11.544 --> 30:13.544
This place
will be filled again.

30:13.546 --> 30:15.512
So much so, you'll
have to open another room.

30:15.514 --> 30:18.882
Right now, I'd give anything
just to have one customer.

30:18.884 --> 30:20.117
You have me.

30:20.119 --> 30:21.318
[door opens]

30:21.320 --> 30:23.954
And you've got me.

30:23.956 --> 30:25.522
And me.

30:25.524 --> 30:27.291
I don't know about
the rest of you,

30:27.293 --> 30:29.226
But I'm starving.

30:29.228 --> 30:30.994
[sighs]

30:30.996 --> 30:33.363
Thank you.
Thank you so much.

30:33.365 --> 30:35.265
No, don't thank us.
You're the one who has to cook.

30:35.267 --> 30:36.266
[chuckling]

30:36.268 --> 30:37.434
[avery]:
I'll help.

30:39.037 --> 30:40.103
You cook?

30:40.105 --> 30:44.074
But you're not a doctor,
and you stitched me.

30:44.076 --> 30:45.409
Ah. Touche.

30:53.318 --> 30:55.152
Jack?

30:55.154 --> 30:56.887
Can we talk?

30:56.889 --> 30:58.455
We can.

30:58.457 --> 31:00.858
Though no matter
what I say,

31:00.860 --> 31:02.926
You seem to hear
something different.

31:05.964 --> 31:09.366
Well, then
let me say it.

31:09.368 --> 31:11.201
Last year,
I was in a play,

31:11.203 --> 31:12.236
The lead, of course,

31:12.238 --> 31:15.038
Who was in love
with someone else's man.

31:17.041 --> 31:18.976
The part never suited me.

31:18.978 --> 31:21.311
In fact, I was quite relieved
when the show ended.

31:21.313 --> 31:23.313
Well, are you saying
your performance in coal valley

31:23.315 --> 31:24.581
Is coming to an end?

31:24.583 --> 31:27.351
Let's just say
the curtain has fallen.

31:27.353 --> 31:28.886
On this act, at least.

31:28.888 --> 31:30.954
So you're leaving
on the stagecoach tomorrow?

31:32.156 --> 31:36.159
Unless something, or...
Someone stops me.

31:37.395 --> 31:39.129
[clears throat]

31:40.265 --> 31:42.332
[chuckles]

31:45.370 --> 31:47.204
I'm sorry, rosemary.

31:49.240 --> 31:50.574
So am I.

32:00.251 --> 32:02.019
Oh!

32:03.354 --> 32:05.656
Oh, my goodness!

32:05.658 --> 32:08.592
Either you all are very early,
or I am very late.

32:08.594 --> 32:11.295
We wanted to get here
before you, miss thatcher.

32:11.297 --> 32:12.963
Oh...

32:14.132 --> 32:16.033
"they are not long,

32:16.035 --> 32:18.035
The days of wine and roses--

32:18.037 --> 32:20.003
Out of a misty dream,

32:20.005 --> 32:22.372
Our path emerges for a while,

32:22.374 --> 32:27.577
Then closes within a dream."

32:27.579 --> 32:29.513
That poem was from
our first week together.

32:33.051 --> 32:34.284
Oh...

32:34.286 --> 32:37.421
It's...

32:37.423 --> 32:39.523
It's halley's comet.

32:39.525 --> 32:42.025
Oh, how lovely.

32:43.494 --> 32:45.462
This is from all of us.

32:52.303 --> 32:54.237
[gasps softly]

32:54.239 --> 32:56.139
[sighs] oh...

32:59.677 --> 33:01.078
Tears of sadness
or happiness,

33:01.080 --> 33:02.012
Miss thatcher?

33:04.349 --> 33:05.515
Both.

33:10.688 --> 33:14.257
Oh, I just love you all
so much.

33:14.259 --> 33:16.393
And you have taught me

33:16.395 --> 33:20.630
More than
you will ever know.

33:20.632 --> 33:23.300
But I want you to know
that I have...

33:23.302 --> 33:26.303
Made a decision.

33:26.305 --> 33:28.305
[sighs]

33:30.608 --> 33:32.476
I'm not leaving you.

33:32.478 --> 33:34.444
Not now
and not ever.

33:34.446 --> 33:35.679
We love you too,
miss thatcher.

33:35.681 --> 33:37.347
Are you staying
because of us,

33:37.349 --> 33:39.016
Or because
of mountie jack?

33:39.018 --> 33:41.518
That is a very
inappropriate question, gabe.

33:41.520 --> 33:43.086
Then it is mountie jack!

33:43.088 --> 33:45.389
[laughter and cheering]

33:45.391 --> 33:47.357
Oh, children!

33:59.570 --> 34:01.638
Hope is in the air.

34:01.640 --> 34:05.075
That
and a little coal dust.

34:09.547 --> 34:11.248
Welcome to coal
valley, your honor.

34:11.250 --> 34:12.182
I'm constable
jack thornton,

34:12.184 --> 34:14.718
And this is
abigail stanton.

34:16.320 --> 34:18.255
Nice to have made
your acquaintance, miss.

34:20.491 --> 34:21.658
Ma'am.

34:21.660 --> 34:23.794
Jedidiah black.

34:23.796 --> 34:26.096
Your reputation
proceeds you, judge.

34:26.098 --> 34:27.230
[chuckles]

34:27.232 --> 34:30.434
Well, unfortunately,
most of it's true.

34:30.436 --> 34:32.235
Stanton, huh?

34:32.237 --> 34:33.370
You're one of the widows?

34:33.372 --> 34:34.571
Uh, yes, sir.

34:34.573 --> 34:37.407
Waiting a long time
for our day in court.

34:37.409 --> 34:39.376
Well, it's here now.

34:39.378 --> 34:41.645
I can't promise
you're gonna like the results.

34:41.647 --> 34:43.680
I can
vouch for that.

34:43.682 --> 34:47.250
Well, it's been a long time,
if I recall correctly.

34:47.252 --> 34:50.320
You still holding a grudge
over a poker game?

34:50.322 --> 34:51.521
Only till
I win it back.

34:51.523 --> 34:53.690
Well, you might have
quite a wait, son.

34:53.692 --> 34:55.358
You got a witness list?

34:56.527 --> 34:58.095
In my room.

34:59.530 --> 35:01.531
Well, you might get it. Now.

35:05.570 --> 35:07.370
Why don't you let me?
I was going there anyway.

35:07.372 --> 35:08.505
Thank you, abigail.

35:08.507 --> 35:10.474
It's in my satchel.

35:10.476 --> 35:12.242
[driver]:
Judge?

35:13.744 --> 35:15.579
I trust you had
a safe ride in?

35:15.581 --> 35:17.681
Well, considering I got
out of cooperville alive,

35:17.683 --> 35:20.383
Well, it doesn't sound
all that good either.

35:20.385 --> 35:24.154
Justice prevailed.
That's what matters.

35:28.292 --> 35:29.593
You expecting someone?

35:29.595 --> 35:31.228
Yeah. Always.

35:31.230 --> 35:33.663
You make a lot of enemies
on this job.

35:33.665 --> 35:35.198
You got a saloon here?

35:35.200 --> 35:35.732
We do.

35:35.734 --> 35:36.700
Poker?

35:37.668 --> 35:39.302
We got that too.

35:40.271 --> 35:42.405
Trial starts at eight.

35:42.407 --> 35:43.673
Sharp.

35:47.411 --> 35:49.446
[man]:
Whoo! Today's the day!

35:52.183 --> 35:54.184
Black! It's time
to meet your maker!

35:54.186 --> 35:55.385
[whap]

35:57.388 --> 36:00.357
So apparently
his little brother here

36:00.359 --> 36:03.226
Don't agree
that justice prevailed.

36:03.228 --> 36:04.494
Lock him up, constable.

36:04.496 --> 36:07.230
Put him on my docket
for tomorrow.

36:44.368 --> 36:45.835
[sighs]

36:55.246 --> 36:56.413
Elizabeth?

36:57.715 --> 36:59.716
[exhales]

36:59.718 --> 37:01.384
Take a walk with me.

37:02.787 --> 37:05.255
Is there a reason
for this walk?

37:06.524 --> 37:08.258
There is.

37:17.268 --> 37:18.602
I have been doing
some reflecting

37:18.604 --> 37:19.936
And some reading.

37:19.938 --> 37:22.505
In fact, I borrowed
one of your history books.

37:22.507 --> 37:24.574
Really?

37:24.576 --> 37:25.875
-Yeah.
-[she laughs]

37:25.877 --> 37:27.911
Did you know that,
of the 27 men

37:27.913 --> 37:29.679
That have been president
of the United States,

37:29.681 --> 37:31.681
Only one
was a bachelor?

37:31.683 --> 37:32.916
Mm-hmm.
James buchanan.

37:32.918 --> 37:35.952
Okay, but can
you name one

37:35.954 --> 37:38.321
Notable accomplishment
of buchanan's?

37:38.323 --> 37:39.656
[laughs] actually,

37:39.658 --> 37:41.925
His failure to deal
with the south's succession

37:41.927 --> 37:43.593
Is considered one of the worst
presidential mistakes

37:43.595 --> 37:44.828
In history.

37:44.830 --> 37:46.663
My point exactly.

37:46.665 --> 37:48.632
What is your point?

37:48.634 --> 37:50.467
That perhaps
his poor judgment began

37:50.469 --> 37:52.569
By not having
a woman by his side.

37:52.571 --> 37:56.306
It was because he was
a confederate sympathizer.

37:56.308 --> 37:58.675
Is there anything
you don't know?

37:58.677 --> 38:01.511
I don't know the reason
for this conversation.

38:01.513 --> 38:03.413
I think you do.

38:03.415 --> 38:05.315
You're running
for president?

38:05.317 --> 38:08.518
[he chuckles and sighs]

38:08.520 --> 38:11.454
Is that a gift
to say goodbye?

38:11.456 --> 38:14.691
I-I didn't bring you up here
to say goodbye.

38:14.693 --> 38:15.825
Open it.

38:34.612 --> 38:36.846
You made this?

38:37.815 --> 38:40.650
A little hobby of mine.

38:40.652 --> 38:43.520
It's a lot harder for me
to say what's in my heart.

38:44.722 --> 38:48.425
I guess I'm not as brave
as everyone thinks.

38:49.760 --> 38:51.561
Yes you are.

38:57.835 --> 38:59.669
Elizabeth,

38:59.671 --> 39:01.905
I have thought long and hard
about us,

39:01.907 --> 39:03.807
As promised,

39:03.809 --> 39:07.510
And I-- I keep coming back
to the same conclusion.

39:10.715 --> 39:12.415
You're the one.

39:12.417 --> 39:15.352
You're the only one.

39:15.354 --> 39:17.487
And I know I said
that I'd support you

39:17.489 --> 39:19.823
Whatever
you decide to do...

39:19.825 --> 39:21.758
But I didn't mean it.

39:27.465 --> 39:28.631
Don't go.

39:30.468 --> 39:32.802
I'm not going anywhere, jack.

39:34.839 --> 39:37.374
[♪]

39:39.410 --> 39:41.745
This is where I belong.

40:12.877 --> 40:15.478
[♪]

40:20.151 --> 40:22.552
[elizabeth, writing]:
<i>And so I have resolved</i>

40:22.554 --> 40:24.854
<i>To make this place my home.</i>

40:24.856 --> 40:26.990
<i>There will be</i>
<i>difficult days ahead,</i>

40:26.992 --> 40:28.525
<i>No doubt.</i>

40:28.527 --> 40:32.629
<i>And uncertain ones.</i>

40:32.631 --> 40:34.731
<i>But I have faith</i>

40:34.733 --> 40:37.934
<i>That true happiness</i>
<i>awaits me here in coal valley,</i>

40:37.936 --> 40:39.969
<i>For what is life</i>

40:39.971 --> 40:42.672
<i>But a bittersweet mix</i>
<i>of sadness...</i>

40:42.674 --> 40:45.508
<i>Wonderment...</i>

40:45.510 --> 40:47.710
<i>Hope...</i>

40:47.712 --> 40:49.946
<i>And joy?</i>

41:40.564 --> 41:41.731
[man]: Hyah!
Giddyup!

41:41.733 --> 41:45.001
Elizabeth.

41:45.003 --> 41:46.669
I-I just wanted to say

41:46.671 --> 41:49.839
That despite whatever
has passed between us,

41:49.841 --> 41:51.908
I wish you all the best.

41:51.910 --> 41:53.142
And I you.

41:53.144 --> 41:56.746
Perhaps we could part
as friends, then?

41:56.748 --> 41:59.249
Friends it is.

41:59.251 --> 42:01.584
Are you headed
back to new york?

42:01.586 --> 42:03.953
Someday.

42:03.955 --> 42:05.722
Where are you headed, then?

42:05.724 --> 42:07.924
Well, for now,

42:07.926 --> 42:10.059
I'm only moving down the street
to a nicer room.

42:10.061 --> 42:11.995
I don't understand.

42:11.997 --> 42:14.597
The mayor has agreed to help me
start a theater group.

42:16.100 --> 42:17.967
Here?

42:17.969 --> 42:19.736
Yes! Isn't it wonderful?

42:19.738 --> 42:22.038
I'll be staying in coal valley,
after all.

42:22.040 --> 42:23.740
Seems we'll be seeing
a lot more of each other.

42:23.742 --> 42:25.141
Wonderful.
