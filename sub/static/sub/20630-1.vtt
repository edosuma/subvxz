02:46.499 --> 02:48.667
- Don't you ever
fucking run from me, bitch!

02:48.669 --> 02:51.703
Where the fuck is my money?!
Where the fuck?! Back up!

02:51.705 --> 02:53.705
Back the fuck up!

02:53.707 --> 02:56.308
Back up! Back the fuck up!

03:06.486 --> 03:08.554
Call the police!

04:04.677 --> 04:06.678
- Let's get the fuck
out of here.

04:40.647 --> 04:42.447
So who are you?

04:42.449 --> 04:44.049
- Vincent.

04:45.585 --> 04:48.287
- Have we met before?

04:48.289 --> 04:50.055
- No.

04:50.757 --> 04:55.394
- So you stepped into that...
And you've never met me before?

04:56.329 --> 04:57.829
- No.

04:59.732 --> 05:01.500
- Why'd you help me?

05:03.002 --> 05:04.603
- I dunno.

05:04.605 --> 05:06.471
Who wouldn't?

05:10.009 --> 05:12.077
- Is that what you do?

05:12.079 --> 05:15.747
Drive around in your cool car
trying to rescue girls
gettin' beat on?

05:15.749 --> 05:17.783
- I dunno.

05:23.856 --> 05:25.791
- I'm roxxy.

05:33.633 --> 05:35.834
Where are you headed?

05:36.869 --> 05:39.037
- Southwest, about...

05:39.039 --> 05:40.939
700 miles.

05:40.941 --> 05:43.442
- You think you can...

05:45.378 --> 05:47.112
...drop me off...

05:48.047 --> 05:50.048
...at a bus station
or something?

05:50.050 --> 05:52.384
- I'll give you a ride there
if you don't mind...

05:52.386 --> 05:54.786
Drivin for a bit.

06:02.662 --> 06:04.963
- You got something to ask me?

06:08.067 --> 06:10.535
I got nothing to hide
in this world.

06:13.573 --> 06:15.640
- How'd you know that guy?

06:19.412 --> 06:21.146
- His name's Cordell.

06:24.851 --> 06:27.486
My brother was killed
three days ago.

06:29.589 --> 06:31.790
He was into some bad shit.

06:34.494 --> 06:37.829
I went to his place
to get some things and...

06:37.831 --> 06:39.664
Cordell was there.

06:42.034 --> 06:44.002
He came after me.

06:44.604 --> 06:46.505
I ran.

06:47.907 --> 06:49.574
You know the rest.

06:51.110 --> 06:53.879
- You thinkin'
about going to the police?

06:56.783 --> 06:59.851
- That's not really an option
with guys like this

07:26.813 --> 07:29.214
- Roxxy!
- Yeah.

07:31.818 --> 07:33.952
- Where you gonna go?

07:35.488 --> 07:37.456
- Anywhere to get away.

07:37.458 --> 07:39.858
You're a good guy, Vincent,

07:39.860 --> 07:42.227
but you don't wanna
get mixed up with me.

07:43.162 --> 07:44.863
Trust me.

07:47.834 --> 07:52.070
- My family, we have a farm...
Just northeast of town.

07:52.839 --> 07:55.207
It's a really nice place.
Big property.

07:55.209 --> 07:58.844
Just stay there until
you figure out your next moves.

07:58.846 --> 08:01.179
- I can't do that.

08:01.181 --> 08:03.582
I don't even know you

08:03.584 --> 08:05.917
- I don't know you.

08:05.919 --> 08:08.220
- Exactly.

08:08.222 --> 08:10.188
Hey, well, listen.

08:10.190 --> 08:12.057
You change your mind,

08:12.059 --> 08:14.559
just ask around for Vincent
or jc Stewart.

08:14.561 --> 08:16.862
You'll find me and my brother.

08:16.864 --> 08:18.663
- No doubt.

11:09.368 --> 11:11.036
- I come out,

11:11.038 --> 11:13.304
there's this dude
sitting in the backseat.

11:13.306 --> 11:17.042
Now I'm, like: "What the fuck?"
This dude looks homeless.

11:17.044 --> 11:21.212
I'm about to whoop some ass
when my auntie,
she tell me to get in.

11:21.214 --> 11:23.748
Says his name is Terry or Jerry,
i don't know,

11:23.750 --> 11:25.717
but she wants
to give him a ride.

11:25.719 --> 11:29.287
I'm, like: "Julie..."
My auntie name Julie.

11:29.289 --> 11:32.223
"We ain't trying to pick up
no hitchhikers on this trip.

11:32.225 --> 11:34.059
You fucking crazy."

11:34.061 --> 11:36.795
She insists, so I'm eyeballing
this guy, right?

11:36.797 --> 11:38.463
Right in the rearview.

11:38.465 --> 11:42.333
Now I notice he's got this bag,
and it's this crazy-looking bag:

11:42.335 --> 11:44.903
All leather
with these chrome rings on it.

11:44.905 --> 11:49.240
I mean,
it's just the kind of bag,
it just exemplifies suspicion.

11:49.242 --> 11:53.244
So I say to him: "Hey, man,
what's in the bag?"

11:53.246 --> 11:56.715
He responds:
"None of your fucking business."

11:56.717 --> 11:59.718
Cold as ice.
I'm starting to get angry.

11:59.720 --> 12:03.154
"Alright, look, man,
i ain't trying to get
in the middle of your deal,

12:03.156 --> 12:05.190
I ain't trying
to fuck with your shit.

12:05.192 --> 12:07.425
I'm just looking out
for my auntie and myself.

12:07.427 --> 12:09.461
I'm just asking:
What's in the bag?"

12:09.463 --> 12:12.397
He leans forward...
Right up in my face,

12:12.399 --> 12:15.100
he says,
"none of your fucking business.

12:15.102 --> 12:16.935
And if you ask me again,

12:16.937 --> 12:19.137
I will fuck you up,
motherfucker."

12:19.139 --> 12:21.506
Lean back.

12:22.942 --> 12:25.210
I look over at Julie,

12:25.212 --> 12:26.778
Julie freaking out.

12:28.782 --> 12:30.448
We drive couple miles,

12:30.450 --> 12:32.450
tension...

12:32.452 --> 12:34.452
...like a motherfucker.

12:34.454 --> 12:36.454
He says, "pull over." So we do.

12:36.456 --> 12:38.223
We pull over
the side of the road,

12:38.225 --> 12:40.759
and he gets out the car,
he's in the weeds or something.

12:40.761 --> 12:44.062
I think he's takin' a piss,
doin' some kind of shit
he doesn't want us to see.

12:44.064 --> 12:45.964
You know what I mean?
Ah...

12:45.966 --> 12:47.966
I look in the backseat.

12:47.968 --> 12:49.801
There's that bag,

12:49.803 --> 12:53.304
just sittin' there,
lookin' right back at me

12:53.306 --> 12:55.373
I look over at the guy.

12:56.308 --> 12:58.977
Guy about 20 feet
from the car.

12:58.979 --> 13:02.313
I turn to Julie.
"Julie, drive, and fuck it."

13:02.315 --> 13:05.817
And we do. We leave his ass
on the side of the road,

13:05.819 --> 13:07.485
bag in the backseat.

13:07.487 --> 13:09.087
Mm...

13:09.089 --> 13:11.523
- Well... what was in the bag?

13:12.992 --> 13:15.059
- None of your fucking business.

13:15.995 --> 13:19.130
Oh... that's what's in the bag,
homie.

13:19.132 --> 13:20.999
- You fuckin' kiddin' me, man.

13:21.001 --> 13:24.335
- You guys fell
for that stale-ass joke, huh?

13:24.337 --> 13:27.038
- Vinnie! Yeah, motherfucker!

13:28.007 --> 13:32.510
Yeah, it's about time, homie!
Come on in, come on in.

13:32.512 --> 13:35.413
Yeah, ah... shit.

13:37.183 --> 13:40.018
Damn, brother, look at you.

13:40.020 --> 13:42.187
- Yeah...

13:42.189 --> 13:43.988
Look at you.

13:47.526 --> 13:49.928
- Intermission, fellas.
Come on..

13:51.096 --> 13:53.598
So how you been?

13:55.034 --> 13:56.835
- Okay.

13:56.837 --> 14:00.438
- How's that city trim looking?
You get a lot of pussy?

14:02.875 --> 14:05.276
Shit, man, pussy good.

14:07.046 --> 14:09.047
Been tough around here, bro.

14:09.049 --> 14:11.382
- Yeah, it's tough all over.

14:11.384 --> 14:13.284
- Yeah, it is.

14:14.553 --> 14:16.287
Good you're back.

14:21.393 --> 14:23.461
- Hey, baby.
- Hey.

14:27.233 --> 14:29.067
Kate...
- Mm?

14:29.069 --> 14:32.136
- This is my brother... Vinnie.

14:33.405 --> 14:36.574
- So fucking good
to finally meet you!

14:36.576 --> 14:39.244
Ah!! Fun!

14:40.179 --> 14:42.080
Hi.

14:42.082 --> 14:44.249
- Vincent.
Nice to meet you, too.

14:44.251 --> 14:46.284
- So how long
are you gonna stay for?

14:46.286 --> 14:49.254
- Um... still figuring that out.

14:49.256 --> 14:53.424
- It's your home too, Vinnie.
You stay as long as you want.

14:53.426 --> 14:55.560
- I'm fucking excited.

14:55.562 --> 14:58.363
- Come on. We supposed to be
celebrating, ain't we?

14:58.365 --> 15:01.466
Drink this beer and smile,
motherfucker.
Stop being a bitch.

15:03.103 --> 15:05.169
Missed the hell outta you.

15:06.272 --> 15:09.540
To my brother Vinnie.
Welcome home, homie.

15:13.679 --> 15:15.446
Mm-hmm.

15:15.448 --> 15:17.949
Now let's do some fuckin' shots,
huh?

15:17.951 --> 15:19.350
- Ah!

16:24.350 --> 16:26.084
- Ah-ha.

16:26.086 --> 16:28.486
Now, fuck, it's bright out here.

16:30.522 --> 16:32.423
How you feelin', bro?

16:33.359 --> 16:35.193
- Okay. How you feel?

16:35.195 --> 16:37.328
- Overachieving, homie.

16:37.330 --> 16:40.765
Overachieving.
Hey, you got a smoke on you?

16:46.038 --> 16:47.505
Thanks.

16:49.541 --> 16:51.442
So what's the word?

16:52.478 --> 16:54.779
- The farm looks like shit.

16:56.548 --> 16:59.283
Everything's all...
Fucking torn up.

17:00.386 --> 17:02.553
You let your crew
ruin this place.

17:02.555 --> 17:06.223
- Last night was a rarity.
A party. For you.

17:08.394 --> 17:10.560
- I didn't ask for a party.

17:10.563 --> 17:12.630
- Yeah, well, you've been gone.

17:12.632 --> 17:16.666
And the farm's been fine.
I've been taking care of shit.

17:16.669 --> 17:18.636
- It doesn't look like that.

17:19.637 --> 17:23.508
- Money's tight, bro.
Put all my bread in the shop.

17:26.412 --> 17:28.746
- You get that up and going?

17:28.748 --> 17:30.748
- It's up, it's going.

17:30.750 --> 17:34.152
Needs some work.
You should come check it out.

17:35.421 --> 17:37.321
- Okay.
- Come by tomorrow,

17:37.323 --> 17:39.724
check it out,
tell me what you think.

17:40.759 --> 17:43.594
- Alright, yeah, I'll do that.
- Cool.

17:51.270 --> 17:54.572
In case you're wondering...
Ma's buried under them trees

17:54.574 --> 17:57.341
down the east side
of our property.

18:06.285 --> 18:08.219
<i> I know it's not much</i>
<i> to look at,</i>

18:08.221 --> 18:11.456
but it's got good bones...
New electricity.

18:11.458 --> 18:16.294
It's a good location in town
and it was cheap.

18:16.296 --> 18:21.199
All she needs now is she needs
to get her nails done
and her hair did.

18:22.134 --> 18:25.136
- Gonna need more than that.
- You gotta start somewhere.

18:25.138 --> 18:29.207
Hard to be a professional
doing repair work out of a barn

18:29.875 --> 18:31.542
so what do you think?

18:31.544 --> 18:33.144
- About what?

18:33.146 --> 18:35.813
- About helping me out.
Being partners.

18:35.815 --> 18:37.882
- Partners?
- Mm-hmm.

18:39.485 --> 18:41.319
- I don't know about that.

18:41.321 --> 18:43.321
- Oh, what the fuck?

18:43.323 --> 18:45.156
Alright, well...

18:45.158 --> 18:47.325
How about you help me
get it set up?

18:47.327 --> 18:50.228
I mean,
you're the best mechanic I know.

18:50.230 --> 18:53.164
And you are my fucking brother,
for chrissake.

18:57.836 --> 18:59.837
- Alright, I can do that...

18:59.839 --> 19:01.606
For now.

19:01.608 --> 19:03.241
- For now!

19:03.243 --> 19:04.909
Cocksucker.

19:06.178 --> 19:08.846
Make me beg you.

19:08.848 --> 19:10.781
Thank you.

19:13.352 --> 19:14.852
- Alright.

19:14.854 --> 19:17.321
- What do you wanna do first?

19:19.858 --> 19:23.227
<i> Here's the problem</i>
<i> with sports today.</i>

19:23.229 --> 19:25.363
<i> Kids are literally</i>
<i> never told no.</i>

19:25.365 --> 19:28.566
<i> You are never told:</i>
<i> "Go sit on the bench, Tommy."</i>

19:28.568 --> 19:30.868
<i> And the reason why</i>
<i> is because we think</i>

19:30.870 --> 19:33.804
<i> we have to coddle children.</i>
<i> They don't have</i>
<i> to win anything.</i>

19:33.806 --> 19:36.541
<i> It's strange,</i>
<i> 'cause as an adult,</i>
<i> I'm often told no.</i>

19:36.543 --> 19:38.609
- Hey.

19:38.611 --> 19:40.278
- Roxxy.

19:40.280 --> 19:42.547
-<i> You get an absolute a--</i>

19:42.549 --> 19:44.715
- hey. You okay?

19:44.717 --> 19:46.884
- Yeah, I'm fine.

19:46.886 --> 19:49.554
Sorry to show up like this.

19:49.556 --> 19:51.956
- No, not at all. It's alright.

19:57.729 --> 19:59.297
- Look, I'm not the...

19:59.299 --> 20:02.300
Type of person
to ask for handouts, but...

20:04.236 --> 20:07.271
...i have no money
and no place to go, so...

20:07.273 --> 20:11.542
If your offer still stands,
i could really use
some figuring-shit-out time.

20:11.544 --> 20:13.911
- Yeah. Yeah, absolutely.

21:08.900 --> 21:10.968
- How long have you lived
out here?

21:11.970 --> 21:13.771
- My whole life.

21:14.806 --> 21:16.741
Until I moved to the city.

21:17.643 --> 21:20.444
- It's pretty. Seems peaceful.

21:24.983 --> 21:28.486
- When we were younger
and family used to come visit,

21:28.488 --> 21:30.054
they'd stay here.

21:31.823 --> 21:33.658
There's a foldout bed...

21:33.660 --> 21:36.494
Yeah, it could use
a good cleaning,

21:36.496 --> 21:39.330
but... you got privacy.

21:39.332 --> 21:41.899
- It's great. Thank you.

21:43.001 --> 21:46.771
I'm gonna pay you back
once I get back on my feet.

21:46.773 --> 21:48.673
- No, no, no,
that's not necessary.

21:48.675 --> 21:51.575
Just take your time, y'know?
You'll figure it out.

22:11.029 --> 22:12.697
You okay?

22:12.699 --> 22:14.065
- Yeah.

22:15.033 --> 22:17.702
Have you heard anything
about the accident?

22:19.371 --> 22:21.038
- What do you mean?

22:21.040 --> 22:23.040
- Anyone looking for us?

22:23.042 --> 22:25.710
- Nah, I haven't heard anything.

22:25.712 --> 22:29.613
You don't think the cops
are looking for us, do you?

22:30.549 --> 22:32.616
- Not the cops
I'm worried about.

22:36.388 --> 22:38.122
How is it?
It taste okay?

22:38.124 --> 22:40.591
- Oh, yeah, it's delicious.
- It does? Okay

22:40.593 --> 22:42.360
- it's great. Thank you.
- Okay.

22:42.362 --> 22:43.627
Whew.

22:52.571 --> 22:54.672
- So what happened to your face?

22:54.674 --> 22:56.807
- I was in a car accident.

22:58.944 --> 23:01.812
- A bad one?
- Yeah, it was real bad.

23:01.814 --> 23:04.815
- Yeah, well...
Glad you're okay.

23:06.051 --> 23:07.818
- When was the accident?

23:08.553 --> 23:10.988
- Um... day before last.

23:10.990 --> 23:12.823
- You go to the hospital?

23:12.825 --> 23:14.458
- No.

23:14.460 --> 23:16.527
- Why not?
- What's with all the questions?

23:16.529 --> 23:20.498
- I'm just askin' roxxy here how
she got them marks on her face.

23:20.500 --> 23:22.099
- Baby, babe...
- What?

23:22.101 --> 23:24.902
- So what are you gonna do
while you're here?

23:24.904 --> 23:27.505
- I just need to find some work,
so...

23:27.507 --> 23:30.074
- I can get you a couple nights
at the bar I work at.

23:30.076 --> 23:32.543
- That would be great.
- Okay.

23:32.545 --> 23:36.080
If you need anything,
any clothes, whatever,
talk to me, I'll hook you up.

23:36.082 --> 23:37.848
- Thank you.

23:38.517 --> 23:40.684
- Cool.

23:44.824 --> 23:46.457
This is fun

23:46.459 --> 23:47.958
I'm excited.

24:17.656 --> 24:19.223
- Hey.

24:26.832 --> 24:28.899
- Nice night, ain't it, bro?

24:29.835 --> 24:31.535
- Yeah.

24:31.970 --> 24:34.905
- That's a pretty girl
you brought to our home.

24:36.508 --> 24:38.576
- Yeah..
- Mm-hmm.

24:39.678 --> 24:41.245
So what's her deal?

24:42.180 --> 24:44.081
- What do you mean?

24:45.851 --> 24:48.152
- She shows up at the shop,

24:48.154 --> 24:50.855
no car, no bags, no money.

24:50.857 --> 24:53.023
She sounds fucked up, homie.

24:53.025 --> 24:55.926
- She was in a bad accident,
okay?

24:55.928 --> 24:58.529
I saw it, I was there.

24:58.531 --> 25:00.531
We had to leave immediately.

25:00.533 --> 25:02.266
She just needs some help.

25:03.034 --> 25:06.203
- You in some kind of trouble?
- No.

25:06.205 --> 25:08.639
- You sure about that?

25:08.641 --> 25:10.875
- I said no.

25:10.877 --> 25:13.043
Everything's cool.

25:13.045 --> 25:18.148
- Okay. Just wanna know
what you're putting
100 feet away from us.

25:18.150 --> 25:20.284
Just looking out.
- Yeah, well...

25:20.286 --> 25:22.887
You don't need to worry
about that, okay?

25:22.889 --> 25:24.922
You worry about you.

25:26.892 --> 25:28.559
- Mm.

26:09.267 --> 26:10.935
- This okay?

26:10.937 --> 26:12.836
- You look great.

26:31.791 --> 26:33.624
- Hey!

26:33.626 --> 26:35.960
Wow, you look fucking good.

26:35.962 --> 26:38.195
Thanks. You, too.

26:39.297 --> 26:42.132
- Big Gary? Hey, big Gary.

26:42.134 --> 26:44.034
- What?
- This is roxxy.

26:44.036 --> 26:45.736
- Nice to meet you, sir.

26:45.738 --> 26:48.606
- Nice to meet you, too.
- No, remember?

26:48.608 --> 26:50.174
I was talking about her
earlier this morning,

26:50.176 --> 26:52.276
how we should hire her
to work a couple shifts?

26:52.278 --> 26:54.378
- It's funny how you were
thinking we should hire her.

26:54.380 --> 26:56.246
Last time I checked,
i do the hiring.

26:56.248 --> 26:58.782
- Come on, seriously,
she would be amazing

26:58.784 --> 27:00.384
for this place.

27:01.653 --> 27:03.687
- You ever bartend before?
- Last four years.

27:03.689 --> 27:06.890
I'm always on time,
don't take any shit,
and work my ass off.

27:06.892 --> 27:08.959
- Mm-hmm.
- Sounds like my kind of girl.

27:08.961 --> 27:13.230
Alright, you can work Thursday
and Saturday nights.
Do a good job.

27:13.232 --> 27:15.833
Katie here will fill you in
on the routine.

27:15.835 --> 27:19.003
- Thank you, big Gary.
- Alright, alright, alright!
- Thank you!

27:19.005 --> 27:20.871
Okay, alright, c'mere.
- Thank you.

29:33.471 --> 29:36.306
- 'Sup, baby?
- Fuck off.

29:36.308 --> 29:39.843
- How come you don't bring
that ass around no more?

29:39.845 --> 29:42.479
- Ah, shut the fuck up, Daryl.
Come on.

29:42.481 --> 29:46.016
- It's just... that ass
brings back memories...

29:46.018 --> 29:49.419
Of when you were
my slam piece.

29:49.421 --> 29:53.123
- Okay, you don't fucking talk
to me like that, okay?
You hear me?

29:53.125 --> 29:55.025
Don't ever touch me like that!

29:55.027 --> 29:56.460
Fuck off!

29:56.462 --> 29:58.061
- Okay.

29:59.998 --> 30:02.399
We got a problem here?

30:07.839 --> 30:09.506
- No,

30:09.508 --> 30:11.408
no, but you might.

30:14.112 --> 30:17.314
Why don't you limp away
before you get smacked, boy?

30:20.852 --> 30:22.452
- Hey, hey. Hey, just relax.

30:22.454 --> 30:25.055
- We can take this shit outside,
bitch.

30:25.057 --> 30:26.590
- We ain't here to fight.
- Uh-huh.

30:26.592 --> 30:28.892
Why don't you mind
your fucking business?

30:28.894 --> 30:31.395
- This is my brother, okay?

30:31.397 --> 30:33.831
- Yo, fuck you and your brother.

30:33.833 --> 30:36.033
- Alright, fellas, that's it.
Y'all gotta go.

30:36.035 --> 30:37.935
- You kickin' us out, hmm?

30:37.937 --> 30:41.371
Well, fuck you and your shitty
fucking bar, Gary!

30:41.373 --> 30:44.474
- Move, move.
- Come on, go, go. Go on.

30:44.476 --> 30:46.476
- Move, move. Now, let's go.

30:46.478 --> 30:48.111
- Fuck you, asshole!

30:49.047 --> 30:51.381
- Move!
- Suck dicks, motherfuckers!

30:51.383 --> 30:52.950
Fuck off!

30:54.385 --> 30:56.520
- He was fucking asking for it.

30:56.522 --> 30:58.388
- Such a fucking asshole.

30:58.390 --> 31:00.190
- What's his problem?

31:00.192 --> 31:02.092
- Look, we got beef.

31:02.094 --> 31:04.595
This knuckle-dragger,
he plays
in a fuckin' rap-metal band.

31:04.597 --> 31:08.866
Man, that shit wasn't cool
10 years ago -
he still got a hard-on for it.

31:08.868 --> 31:11.535
Him and his boys,
they like to smoke meth,

31:11.537 --> 31:14.938
jerk each other off.
Na-na-na-na-na-na.

31:15.573 --> 31:17.441
- What's his problem with you?

31:20.378 --> 31:22.913
- I was with Daryl before jc.
- Yeah,

31:22.915 --> 31:25.582
so he's got a problem
'cause Kate upgraded.

31:25.584 --> 31:27.284
Shit.

31:27.286 --> 31:30.587
- Last thing we need
is trouble from this guy.

31:30.589 --> 31:32.389
Don't provoke him anymore.

31:32.391 --> 31:33.991
Fuck him.

31:35.093 --> 31:37.060
- Easy for you to say.

31:50.275 --> 31:52.175
- Hi, baby!
- Hey.

31:53.278 --> 31:56.280
- What you doin'?
- D'you bring me
a ham-and-cheese?

31:56.282 --> 31:59.316
- Shut the fuck up.
Don't touch me with that!

31:59.318 --> 32:01.685
I swear to god, baby!

32:05.957 --> 32:07.958
- Hi.
- Hey.

32:07.960 --> 32:09.626
- How's your day?

32:09.628 --> 32:11.461
- Ah, well, good.

32:11.463 --> 32:13.563
How's yours?
- Good.

32:13.565 --> 32:15.032
- Cool.

32:15.034 --> 32:17.634
- Do you wanna maybe grab a bite
with me?

32:17.636 --> 32:20.137
- Grab a bite with you?
- Yeah, with me.

32:20.139 --> 32:22.472
- Do you think we could do that?

32:22.474 --> 32:26.143
- I don't know, we could try.
You cool with that?

32:26.145 --> 32:28.979
- Yeah, yeah, we could do that.

32:28.981 --> 32:30.480
- Okay.

32:30.482 --> 32:32.149
- Let me go change.

32:32.151 --> 32:33.550
- Okay.

32:39.691 --> 32:42.559
- Why you knocking moonshine?
- It's disgusting!
I can't believe you drink that.

32:42.561 --> 32:44.695
- Everybody drinks moonshine
in these parts.

32:44.697 --> 32:47.064
White lightning
will mess you up.

32:47.066 --> 32:48.665
- It's like drinking
pure gasoline.

32:48.667 --> 32:51.001
- We did actually start
a lawnmower

32:51.003 --> 32:54.104
with some firewater
we once made.

32:54.106 --> 32:56.139
- See, that's not good.
- Yeah.

32:58.276 --> 33:00.110
Anything good?

33:00.112 --> 33:02.746
- Mm... mostly older stuff.

33:05.016 --> 33:07.184
You wanna pick something?

33:09.187 --> 33:10.587
- Alright.

33:23.701 --> 33:25.268
- Really?

33:28.206 --> 33:30.407
- It's a great song.

33:30.409 --> 33:32.109
- Aw...

33:32.111 --> 33:34.077
Vincent, you're a romantic.

33:37.249 --> 33:39.182
it's sweet.

33:45.757 --> 33:47.624
Um...

33:48.726 --> 33:52.729
Jc and Kate are gonna go
to the carnival tonight.
You wanna go?

33:52.731 --> 33:54.564
Yeah, that'd be fun.

33:54.566 --> 33:57.034
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

33:58.236 --> 34:00.437
- Don't even think about it!
I'm paying.

34:00.439 --> 34:02.639
- Come on, let me pay.
- No way.

34:02.641 --> 34:05.375
I'm not letting you pay
for anything ever.

34:08.079 --> 34:09.478
- Alright.

34:09.481 --> 34:11.815
Thank you.
- You're welcome.

34:12.784 --> 34:15.619
- I'm excited
about this carnival.

34:18.255 --> 34:20.322
- I was thinking about...

34:21.426 --> 34:24.594
...wearing my moustache
to the carnival tonight.

34:24.596 --> 34:27.097
- Oh...
- What do you think?

34:27.099 --> 34:29.065
Look pretty?

34:30.268 --> 34:34.103
- That's not... the first...
Adjective I'd describe--

34:34.106 --> 34:35.772
- gorgeous?
- More like--

34:35.774 --> 34:37.774
- stunning.
- Very fried.

34:46.452 --> 34:49.453
- I wish we had one,
like, in our backyard...

34:51.456 --> 34:53.523
Ah!

34:53.525 --> 34:55.192
- Alright.
Well, it's beer-thirty.

34:55.194 --> 34:58.628
I'm gonna go hit the booze tent.
You guys wanna come?

34:58.630 --> 35:01.364
- I'm okay.
- We'll walk around
for a little bit.

35:01.366 --> 35:04.868
We'll meet up in a few, alright?
- Cool.
- Okay. Bye, you guys.

35:09.807 --> 35:11.708
- I should've been a carnie.
- Yeah?

35:11.710 --> 35:14.311
- Mm-hmm.
- Would you work rides or games?

35:14.313 --> 35:15.812
- Freak show.

35:15.814 --> 35:18.215
Bearded lady, two-headed dogs,

35:18.217 --> 35:20.484
sword swallowers,
that sorta thing.

35:20.486 --> 35:23.220
- Well, I think
you'd fit right in.

35:23.222 --> 35:23.887
- I'm sure you do.

35:28.826 --> 35:32.162
How much you think these places
pull in a night?

35:32.164 --> 35:33.897
- That's hard to say.

35:34.832 --> 35:36.833
- You think, like...

35:36.835 --> 35:38.568
25 a night?

35:39.837 --> 35:42.172
- I'd say closer to 100 a night.

35:42.174 --> 35:45.408
- That's a lot for cheap prizes
and funnel cakes.

35:46.177 --> 35:49.679
So crazy,
all this here for a week,
then it's gone.

35:49.681 --> 35:51.515
- That's the allure.

35:51.517 --> 35:54.751
Something that doesn't
come along every day.

35:58.189 --> 36:00.357
- So how would you do it?

36:00.359 --> 36:02.926
- Do what?
- Rob the carnival.

36:07.533 --> 36:10.600
- I don't know.
How would you do it?

36:11.369 --> 36:14.638
- I'd probably, you know,
scout it out first,

36:14.640 --> 36:17.941
then hit the highest-paying
rides and games.

36:18.342 --> 36:21.211
- Well, rides are ticket-based.
You gotta go games.

36:21.213 --> 36:22.812
- Or ticket booths.

36:22.814 --> 36:25.515
That's gotta be
the highest... payout.

36:25.517 --> 36:28.218
- And the most watched
by security.

36:28.220 --> 36:32.289
- So... if we're going
to scout this place out...

36:33.224 --> 36:36.793
...what do you think
is the best vantage point?

36:39.564 --> 36:41.298
Hmm.

36:50.808 --> 36:52.642
So you afraid of heights?

36:52.644 --> 36:55.579
- Uh... no, no. Are you?

36:55.581 --> 36:57.581
- Yeah.
- Oh, no!

36:57.583 --> 36:59.950
Oh, now you tell me. Oh.

36:59.952 --> 37:03.253
This makes the way
we're gonna die way worse now.

37:03.255 --> 37:05.589
- Why would you say that?!
- This is horrible.

37:05.591 --> 37:07.757
- Oh...

37:07.759 --> 37:10.727
I can't stop laughing.
Okay, no, I'm fine.

37:10.729 --> 37:12.929
- It's cool.
- I'm getting it together.

37:16.434 --> 37:18.768
Man, look at this place.

37:18.770 --> 37:22.772
We could take this thing down
before they even knew
what hit them.

37:22.774 --> 37:25.609
- I think we just go after
the boss.

37:25.611 --> 37:28.445
Bigger score...
Bite the head off the snake.

37:28.447 --> 37:31.014
- That's not nearly as much fun,
though.

37:32.617 --> 37:36.519
- So how many people
do you think it would take
to pull this off?

37:37.622 --> 37:39.422
- Mm...

37:40.291 --> 37:41.858
Two.

37:49.967 --> 37:51.868
Sorry.
- No.

38:02.713 --> 38:04.547
- Red or white?

38:05.483 --> 38:06.883
- Red.

38:06.885 --> 38:09.052
- How 'bout white?

38:09.987 --> 38:11.755
- White's alright.

38:13.825 --> 38:15.725
- It's all we got.

38:33.844 --> 38:35.745
- thanks.
- You're welcome.

38:36.881 --> 38:40.016
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

40:13.477 --> 40:15.979
So did you fuck her?

40:15.981 --> 40:17.614
- What?

40:23.120 --> 40:25.889
Did you fuck roxxy?

40:27.458 --> 40:30.560
- Why would you say that?
- Chemistry, bro,

40:30.562 --> 40:34.464
I can see it. So you guys
didn't fuck around?

40:35.466 --> 40:37.700
- No.
- Damn.

40:38.569 --> 40:41.704
When shit goes off, whew...

40:41.706 --> 40:44.140
It's gonna be explosive.

40:44.142 --> 40:47.944
You better watch out, homie,
you gonna fall in love

40:47.946 --> 40:49.879
- whatever, bro.

40:49.881 --> 40:53.550
I'm not in any position to be
involved with a woman right now.

40:53.552 --> 40:55.985
- Yeah, bro,
but you are involved.

40:55.987 --> 40:59.856
So hopefully she'll put you
in several different positions.

40:59.858 --> 41:03.159
- Fuck off. She's a good girl.
- Hey.

41:03.161 --> 41:06.529
She's a great girl.
One of a kind.

41:06.531 --> 41:08.932
That's why you're in trouble,
homie.

41:12.503 --> 41:15.171
- Thanks.
- Mm-hmm.

41:15.173 --> 41:17.073
- So, uh...

41:18.008 --> 41:20.910
...what are you doing
after you get off?

41:22.012 --> 41:23.813
- No plans.
- Hmm.

41:23.815 --> 41:27.550
You, uh...
You wanna go for a ride?

41:27.552 --> 41:29.986
With you?

41:29.988 --> 41:32.021
- Yeah.

41:35.025 --> 41:36.593
- Where to?

41:36.595 --> 41:38.261
- Mm...

41:39.530 --> 41:41.197
I'll think of something

41:43.534 --> 41:45.235
- okay.

42:09.561 --> 42:11.794
- What the fuck happened?

42:13.898 --> 42:15.565
- Well...

42:15.567 --> 42:18.067
They shot up my truck...

42:18.069 --> 42:20.803
With a fucking pellet gun.

42:27.244 --> 42:29.579
You saw Daryl do this?

42:29.581 --> 42:33.550
- I-i didn't see who did it,
but I did see a truck

42:33.552 --> 42:35.218
that could've been Daryl's
driving off.

42:35.220 --> 42:36.853
- This motherfucker's
asking for it.

42:36.855 --> 42:39.255
Who the fuck
does he think he is?

42:39.257 --> 42:41.824
- You sure it was Daryl's truck?

42:43.594 --> 42:45.662
- Pretty sure, yeah.

43:39.350 --> 43:40.984
- Go, go, go!

43:54.798 --> 43:57.667
- How long has this place
been shut down?

43:57.669 --> 43:59.335
- Like 20 years or something.

43:59.337 --> 44:02.672
I used to see a couple movies
here when I was a kid.

44:02.674 --> 44:06.175
Mostly second-run stuff,
but it was pretty cool.

44:06.177 --> 44:09.345
- I'd love to see a movie
at a drive-in.

44:09.347 --> 44:12.248
- You never have?
- No, never have.

44:20.691 --> 44:22.692
So what's your sign?

44:22.694 --> 44:24.360
- What...

44:24.362 --> 44:26.195
What do you mean?

44:26.197 --> 44:29.932
- You know what I mean.
Your sign. What's your sign?

44:33.037 --> 44:35.438
- I'm a Leo.
- A Leo!

44:36.707 --> 44:38.274
That makes sense.

44:39.710 --> 44:41.711
I'm a gemini.

44:41.713 --> 44:44.213
And just so you know...

44:44.215 --> 44:47.216
Leos and geminis
get along splendidly.

44:47.218 --> 44:51.454
- Oh, is that so? Do they?
- Yeah, it's true.

44:51.456 --> 44:54.390
Mm-hmm, that is correct.

44:54.392 --> 44:57.126
- How was the rest
of your night?

44:58.395 --> 45:00.063
- It was okay.

45:00.065 --> 45:02.765
Kate's pretty pissed
about the whole truck thing.

45:02.767 --> 45:06.235
I spent the rest of the night
trying to chill her out.

45:06.237 --> 45:07.904
- Yeah.

45:07.906 --> 45:10.073
- How's jc?

45:10.075 --> 45:14.077
- Uh... he's not really one
to let things go.

45:14.079 --> 45:16.946
Yeah, I see that.

45:19.917 --> 45:22.485
What were you like
when you were a kid?

45:24.088 --> 45:26.289
- I don't know.
What were you like?

45:26.291 --> 45:28.758
I bet you were really
rebellious, huh?

45:28.760 --> 45:31.160
- Shit. Still am.

45:35.432 --> 45:38.301
Tell me, though.
Seriously, I wanna know.
What were you like?

45:38.303 --> 45:40.236
- Mm...
- I can see you, like,

45:40.238 --> 45:44.140
in fifth grade with one of those
bad spiked-on-top mullets.

45:44.142 --> 45:48.778
- Yeah, had the lines shaved
down the sides and everything.
That was the style.

45:48.780 --> 45:50.847
- Yeah, that was the style
right there.

45:51.782 --> 45:55.318
- Yeah. Well, bad haircut aside,
i was pretty normal,

45:55.320 --> 45:56.919
I guess.

45:57.788 --> 46:00.123
Played a lot of sports,
wrenched on cars.

46:00.125 --> 46:02.191
But I was always...

46:04.461 --> 46:07.130
I always felt trapped
in this town.

46:08.799 --> 46:12.869
For a while,
i was scared to even leave.

46:14.071 --> 46:16.205
- Scared of what?

46:17.141 --> 46:19.108
- Being disappointed, you know?

46:20.144 --> 46:23.146
That in this whole world
outside this town,

46:23.148 --> 46:25.548
there was... nothing better.

46:26.817 --> 46:29.018
Nothing special.

46:30.154 --> 46:32.355
- You still feel that way?

46:33.323 --> 46:35.958
- There's definitely
something special.

46:42.332 --> 46:44.967
- Why are you looking at me
like that?

46:48.338 --> 46:50.439
- Like what?

49:11.248 --> 49:13.049
- Look at me.

49:13.984 --> 49:16.552
- Roxxy.
- Who are you?

49:17.554 --> 49:19.989
- I don't know
what's going on...

49:19.991 --> 49:21.991
But please put the gun down.

49:21.993 --> 49:24.060
- Who are you?

49:25.996 --> 49:28.064
- Please calm down.

49:28.066 --> 49:30.132
What do you mean?

49:32.002 --> 49:34.603
- Where did you get
this address?

49:37.074 --> 49:39.275
This is my brother's address!

49:40.177 --> 49:41.744
- Your brother?

49:41.746 --> 49:44.747
- Answer me!!
- It's not what it looks like.

49:45.682 --> 49:47.183
It's not.

49:47.185 --> 49:49.652
- Did you kill my brother?

49:49.654 --> 49:53.189
- No, absolutely not.
- Don't fucking lie to me!

49:53.191 --> 49:54.757
- I swear.

49:55.525 --> 49:57.426
I swear.

50:00.464 --> 50:02.598
- You need to start talking.

50:03.533 --> 50:07.069
- I was just paid by a guy
i worked at a shop with

50:07.071 --> 50:09.205
to watch a house
for a few nights.

50:09.207 --> 50:12.575
I didn't know your brother.
I didn't know anything about it

50:12.577 --> 50:15.044
- are you involved with them?!
- No. I was just paid

50:15.046 --> 50:18.180
by the guy I worked with
just to watch a house.

50:27.057 --> 50:28.791
- Fuck!!!

50:41.171 --> 50:42.571
- Roxxy.

50:42.573 --> 50:44.407
- Stay away from me!

50:44.409 --> 50:48.244
- I didn't know about you,
or your brother, or any of this.

50:48.246 --> 50:50.179
- I'm so stupid.
- Just calm down.

50:50.181 --> 50:52.415
- Fuck you!

50:52.417 --> 50:54.750
Fuck you!!

50:56.586 --> 50:58.421
I trusted you!

50:59.389 --> 51:01.590
- I know.

51:02.592 --> 51:04.560
- You're a fucking liar.

51:05.529 --> 51:07.296
- Roxxy.

51:07.298 --> 51:09.765
You don't even know me.

51:12.669 --> 51:14.837
So who are you anyway?

51:15.739 --> 51:18.274
Who are you, Vincent?

51:22.312 --> 51:24.180
No one.

51:25.115 --> 51:26.782
That's who.

51:28.285 --> 51:30.252
You're no one.

51:32.289 --> 51:34.857
It was a mistake
ever coming here.

51:53.643 --> 51:56.145
- Good night, Kate.
- Bye!

51:56.147 --> 51:58.214
See you tomorrow.

52:02.319 --> 52:04.553
Hey.

52:04.555 --> 52:06.822
What's the matter?

52:06.824 --> 52:09.492
You've hardly talked all night.

52:09.494 --> 52:11.227
- I'm fine.

52:12.662 --> 52:14.897
- Well, what's the problem?

52:16.500 --> 52:18.234
- Nothing.

52:18.236 --> 52:20.402
- Come on, talk to me.

52:21.505 --> 52:23.405
- I'm leaving town.

52:24.174 --> 52:26.342
- Why?

52:26.344 --> 52:28.911
I thought you were happy here,
right?

52:28.913 --> 52:30.880
- I was.

52:30.882 --> 52:32.381
- What?

52:33.316 --> 52:35.851
- Things change, you know?

52:36.686 --> 52:38.420
- Yeah.

52:38.422 --> 52:41.891
Things aren't always gonna be
perfect, that's for sure.

52:41.893 --> 52:43.459
I mean...

52:43.461 --> 52:46.428
But you know that we care
about you, right?

52:48.532 --> 52:51.267
- Yeah. Look,
i appreciate you...

52:51.868 --> 52:53.669
...so much.

52:53.671 --> 52:56.505
Everything you've done for me.

52:56.507 --> 52:58.707
I just don't belong here.

52:58.709 --> 53:01.477
- You don't belong here?
Before you got here,

53:01.479 --> 53:03.512
I didn't even have
any girlfriends.

53:03.514 --> 53:06.549
Roxx, it's been so nice
to have you here.

53:06.551 --> 53:10.886
Look, I'd be sad if you left,
and I knew Vincent would be too.

53:10.888 --> 53:13.289
- It's complicated, but it's...

53:15.225 --> 53:17.893
It's not gonna work out
with Vincent.

53:17.895 --> 53:20.296
- I've been in this town
a long time.

53:21.898 --> 53:24.400
Vincent ain't like everybody
else around here.

53:24.402 --> 53:27.903
He's not happy or satisfied with
just being here and belonging.

53:27.905 --> 53:30.906
He's a searcher, like you.

53:31.741 --> 53:33.976
Whatever the problem is...

53:33.978 --> 53:37.546
Maybe just hear him out.
Yeah?

53:37.548 --> 53:39.982
I know he really cares
about you.

53:43.253 --> 53:44.987
Okay?

53:45.989 --> 53:48.290
- Okay.

53:52.929 --> 53:54.630
- Alright.

53:54.632 --> 53:57.800
I think we need something
a little stronger than beer.

53:57.802 --> 53:59.602
What do you think?

53:59.604 --> 54:01.437
- Yes, please.
- Okay.

54:08.613 --> 54:10.913
- Can we turn off
the sports radio already?

54:10.915 --> 54:13.716
We've been listening
to the same shit all day.

54:13.718 --> 54:17.853
- Yeah, bro, you can turn it off
and change it
whenever you want.

54:17.855 --> 54:20.756
- How can you listen to that
all the time?

54:20.758 --> 54:23.726
- Change it, bro!
Change it to anything you want!

54:23.728 --> 54:25.794
What's your problem?

54:25.796 --> 54:28.264
- This place is getting to me,
that's my problem.

54:28.266 --> 54:31.634
- You need some time off?
Why don't you head out
for the rest of the day, then?

54:31.636 --> 54:35.638
- And leave you by yourself?
Not a good idea.

54:35.640 --> 54:37.906
- Now what's that
supposed to mean?

54:37.908 --> 54:40.309
- If I left you by yourself,

54:40.311 --> 54:42.711
you wouldn't have a business
right now.

54:42.713 --> 54:44.647
- How you figure that?

54:44.649 --> 54:46.482
- 'Cause that's what happens

54:46.484 --> 54:49.285
when you can't get your shit
together ever.

54:49.287 --> 54:51.887
- I asked <i> you</i>
to come into <i> my</i> business

54:51.889 --> 54:53.989
so we could share
something together.

54:53.991 --> 54:55.624
- We've shared plenty.

54:55.626 --> 54:59.328
Mostly messes
that I have to clean up.

55:03.667 --> 55:07.036
- You got a chip
on your shoulder.
Who doesn't?

55:07.038 --> 55:09.371
But you don't talk to me
that way.

55:09.373 --> 55:11.607
- Talk to you like what?

55:11.609 --> 55:14.576
Well, you're the king
of shit talk.
That's all you do.

55:14.578 --> 55:18.447
Ever since I got back,
you've been trying
to guilt-trip me about leaving.

55:18.449 --> 55:22.518
- You left me
to bury our mother alone!!

55:22.520 --> 55:24.887
I needed you, bro!

55:24.889 --> 55:27.489
Your family needed you!

55:27.491 --> 55:29.825
- Family?! What do you know
about family?!

55:29.827 --> 55:32.628
I took care of ma
for three years

55:32.630 --> 55:35.030
while she was sick
and fucking dying!!

55:36.032 --> 55:37.866
Where were you?!

55:37.868 --> 55:40.469
Y-y-you're just supposed
to just show up

55:40.471 --> 55:44.039
to fucking bury her,
and I'm supposed to feel
sympathy for you?! No!

55:44.041 --> 55:46.075
Burying ma was the easy part.

55:46.077 --> 55:48.410
- Fuck you.

55:48.412 --> 55:50.045
- Oh, fuck you!

55:50.047 --> 55:52.715
Why do you think I left, huh?

55:52.717 --> 55:55.751
It wasn't 'cause of mom dying.
I was sick of you.

55:55.753 --> 55:58.053
'Cause you're a fuck-up.

55:58.055 --> 56:00.055
- You're living in the past,
bro.

56:00.057 --> 56:04.059
That was a long time ago
and that ain't me no more.

56:08.898 --> 56:10.799
- You guys okay?

56:11.835 --> 56:13.736
Hey.

57:40.657 --> 57:42.224
- Hello?

57:43.159 --> 57:44.793
What?!

57:54.838 --> 57:57.005
What the fuck happened here?

57:57.007 --> 57:59.575
Chicks dig scars.

58:00.877 --> 58:03.779
- Where the fuck are they?
- I don't fucking know.

58:03.781 --> 58:06.915
- Don't worry about Daryl
and them. They gonna get theirs.

58:06.917 --> 58:08.650
I'm gonna kill
that motherfucker.

58:13.022 --> 58:15.057
- Motherfucker!!

58:59.736 --> 59:02.137
- You want some too,
motherfucker?

59:22.893 --> 59:25.827
- You fuck with my family again,
I'm gonna fucking kill you.

59:25.829 --> 59:28.330
Do you understand
what I'm saying?

59:28.332 --> 59:30.599
I need to hear you say it,
alright?!

59:30.601 --> 59:32.768
Say it, motherfucker, say it!

59:32.770 --> 59:37.105
Say it,
or I'm gonna fucking kill you!
I will fucking kill you!

59:37.107 --> 59:39.775
- You'll fucking kill me!

59:39.777 --> 59:41.743
Fucking kill me!

59:58.995 --> 01:00:01.363
- How bad d'you beat him?

01:00:05.034 --> 01:00:06.768
- Pretty bad.

01:00:08.638 --> 01:00:10.872
- He's gonna be looking for you.

01:00:13.977 --> 01:00:15.711
- Fuck him.

01:00:18.648 --> 01:00:22.317
- Ah, I thought we were supposed
to be playing it cool.

01:00:22.319 --> 01:00:23.885
- Yeah.

01:00:27.156 --> 01:00:28.724
- You okay?

01:00:33.329 --> 01:00:35.397
- Yeah, I'm, uh...

01:00:38.167 --> 01:00:40.902
I'm okay. I just, um...

01:00:42.672 --> 01:00:45.874
...fucking hate
that side of myself.

01:00:47.010 --> 01:00:48.844
- Them little boys,

01:00:48.846 --> 01:00:52.247
they think it's alright
to piss all over everything.

01:00:53.683 --> 01:00:55.417
Fuck them.

01:01:01.424 --> 01:01:02.924
- Hey.

01:01:05.695 --> 01:01:09.197
I'm sorry about what I said.
Okay?

01:01:12.035 --> 01:01:14.036
I didn't mean it.

01:01:14.038 --> 01:01:15.937
You're my brother.

01:01:16.839 --> 01:01:18.707
- You meant it.

01:01:18.709 --> 01:01:20.442
And you should be sorry.

01:01:23.713 --> 01:01:27.015
I know... I fucked up
for a long time,

01:01:27.017 --> 01:01:29.785
but I'm trying to do better,
homie.

01:01:34.891 --> 01:01:38.293
- You know I walked by
ma's grave today?

01:01:41.898 --> 01:01:44.466
Man, you did
a fucking great job.

01:01:45.401 --> 01:01:46.935
- Hey...

01:01:50.073 --> 01:01:54.076
You know I set her up
on the east facing the west?

01:01:54.078 --> 01:01:56.745
Watch the sunset every evening.

01:02:03.252 --> 01:02:05.821
- I just miss her so much,
you know?

01:02:09.358 --> 01:02:10.992
- I know it.

01:02:15.932 --> 01:02:18.133
But what happens next?

01:02:22.105 --> 01:02:25.006
- Still trying
to figure that one out.

01:02:41.124 --> 01:02:43.158
Can I come in?

01:02:43.160 --> 01:02:45.026
- It's your place.

01:02:48.798 --> 01:02:51.133
What are you doing?

01:02:51.135 --> 01:02:53.301
- I'm leaving tomorrow.

01:02:53.303 --> 01:02:55.270
- Don't do this.

01:02:55.272 --> 01:02:57.105
- I need to leave.

01:02:57.107 --> 01:03:00.075
I was gonna try and stick out
the week to make some cash,

01:03:00.077 --> 01:03:03.211
but I've gotta get out of here.
- I know you're angry with me,

01:03:03.213 --> 01:03:07.916
but I didn't know that house
i was watching
was your brother's house.

01:03:07.918 --> 01:03:10.252
The morning of the accident,
i was leaving the city.

01:03:10.254 --> 01:03:12.821
I wanted nothing more to do
with any of that.

01:03:12.823 --> 01:03:14.389
- It doesn't matter.

01:03:17.994 --> 01:03:20.829
This just isn't the place
for me.

01:03:20.831 --> 01:03:22.531
- Just stay here.

01:03:22.533 --> 01:03:24.065
Let me help you.

01:03:24.067 --> 01:03:26.501
- Why do you want to help me?!

01:03:26.503 --> 01:03:30.405
Why do you have this desire
to take care of me?!

01:03:31.507 --> 01:03:33.341
I can take care of myself.

01:03:33.343 --> 01:03:35.577
- I just thought
that you needed--

01:03:35.579 --> 01:03:38.413
- don't worry about what I need.

01:03:39.849 --> 01:03:42.250
You don't know me like that,
Vincent.

01:03:45.021 --> 01:03:47.088
Worry about what you need.

01:03:48.858 --> 01:03:52.194
- I just wanna make this right.
- You can't make things right!

01:03:52.196 --> 01:03:54.196
Don't you get that?!

01:03:54.198 --> 01:03:57.098
Nothing will ever be right
with you.

01:03:59.202 --> 01:04:01.002
It's everywhere.

01:04:02.538 --> 01:04:04.439
It's who you are.

01:04:06.375 --> 01:04:08.276
It's in your blood.

01:04:12.048 --> 01:04:13.949
- And what's that?

01:04:19.055 --> 01:04:20.622
- Violence.

01:04:22.892 --> 01:04:24.459
Hmm?

01:04:33.069 --> 01:04:34.569
No.

01:04:34.571 --> 01:04:36.304
- Roxxy.
- No.

01:04:42.578 --> 01:04:44.312
Stop!

01:04:53.422 --> 01:04:56.324
I want us to be together so bad.

01:04:58.094 --> 01:04:59.995
- We can be.

01:08:01.777 --> 01:08:04.345
Please, no, no!

01:08:05.581 --> 01:08:07.115
- Fuck!!

01:08:07.117 --> 01:08:09.284
Fucking dammit!

01:08:09.286 --> 01:08:10.852
Fuck!

01:08:13.289 --> 01:08:15.490
- Vincent!!!
- Oh, my god!

01:08:15.492 --> 01:08:17.192
- Vincent!

01:08:18.862 --> 01:08:21.162
- This our boy?
- Yeah, that's our boy.

01:08:21.163 --> 01:08:24.466
- String him up.
No!
Fuckin' shit!

01:08:24.468 --> 01:08:26.468
No!

01:08:26.470 --> 01:08:28.103
- Come on.
- Vinnie!

01:08:28.104 --> 01:08:31.206
- No, no, please, please!
- Yo! Let him go!

01:08:31.207 --> 01:08:34.375
Let him the fuck go! Vinnie!
Fuckin' shit!

01:08:35.144 --> 01:08:36.644
- No. No.

01:08:38.482 --> 01:08:40.348
- Vinnie!!

01:08:43.118 --> 01:08:45.319
Vinnie! Ah!!

01:08:45.322 --> 01:08:47.322
- You fucked up, fam.

01:08:47.323 --> 01:08:49.323
Fuck!
- Love this shit.

01:08:58.501 --> 01:09:00.835
No! Fuck!

01:09:00.837 --> 01:09:04.139
Yo, you put him the fuck down,
homie!

01:09:04.140 --> 01:09:06.207
- Know who I am?

01:09:06.209 --> 01:09:08.510
Hmm?

01:09:08.511 --> 01:09:10.645
- Yo, fuck you, motherfucker!

01:09:10.647 --> 01:09:14.182
Come on. Bring that shit to me!
Bring that shit to me,
motherfucker!

01:09:14.184 --> 01:09:15.750
Baby, baby, please!
- Yeah, you!

01:09:15.752 --> 01:09:18.219
I'm fuckin' talking to you!
- Cut him up.

01:09:18.220 --> 01:09:21.723
- Fuck you, you fucking chump!
Bring that shit to me!

01:09:21.725 --> 01:09:23.625
- No, no, no, no!!

01:09:23.627 --> 01:09:25.693
No, no, no, no!!!

01:09:25.694 --> 01:09:28.363
Oh, my god, no! Please stop!

01:09:28.365 --> 01:09:30.198
Please stop! No! Stop!

01:09:30.200 --> 01:09:32.233
No...

01:09:33.536 --> 01:09:36.270
- Keep running your mouth,
motherfucker.

01:09:37.206 --> 01:09:40.274
Cry, cry, you lil' bitch,
cry, cry.

01:09:41.410 --> 01:09:43.711
- We got everyone's attention?

01:09:43.712 --> 01:09:45.380
Good.

01:09:45.381 --> 01:09:47.215
I'm suga.

01:09:47.216 --> 01:09:48.716
I'm the truth.

01:09:48.718 --> 01:09:51.752
These two already know 'bout me.
Or at least they should.

01:09:51.755 --> 01:09:55.390
And you two are in the process
of learning right now.

01:09:55.392 --> 01:09:58.626
I'm the nigga that don't give
a fuck about your life.

01:10:00.229 --> 01:10:03.431
Your brother,
he was always owing me money.

01:10:04.500 --> 01:10:06.367
You owe, you pay.

01:10:07.236 --> 01:10:09.304
So he got himself killed.

01:10:11.574 --> 01:10:15.410
And you,
you know where my money is,
don't you?

01:10:16.312 --> 01:10:18.213
- I don't know anything.

01:10:18.215 --> 01:10:20.615
- I say you do.
Speak up,

01:10:20.617 --> 01:10:22.951
or everyone dies.

01:10:22.953 --> 01:10:24.419
Everyone.

01:10:24.421 --> 01:10:26.654
- I don't know anything!

01:10:26.656 --> 01:10:29.757
- So I'm-a count. One...

01:10:29.759 --> 01:10:32.260
- No, no, no, no...

01:10:32.262 --> 01:10:35.330
- Don't. Please.
- Wait. Wait.

01:10:35.332 --> 01:10:36.965
- Please!

01:10:36.967 --> 01:10:38.600
- Stop it!!

01:10:49.311 --> 01:10:51.646
- Two.

01:10:53.282 --> 01:10:55.883
I don't know anything!!

01:11:06.962 --> 01:11:08.796
- Do him.

01:11:08.798 --> 01:11:10.365
- No!!

01:11:11.700 --> 01:11:13.568
Please. Please!

01:11:21.310 --> 01:11:23.745
Please stop.

01:11:29.551 --> 01:11:31.719
No!!

01:11:41.330 --> 01:11:43.431
- Do what you want with her,

01:11:43.433 --> 01:11:45.566
then burn the place down,
alright?

01:13:52.961 --> 01:13:55.062
No! No!

01:14:09.611 --> 01:14:11.546
- Motherfucker!

01:14:38.240 --> 01:14:39.907
- Oh...

01:14:42.511 --> 01:14:44.245
- I'm sorry.

01:14:45.514 --> 01:14:47.248
- Don't be.

01:14:56.525 --> 01:14:58.926
- This is my... fault.

01:15:04.032 --> 01:15:05.867
- No, it's not.

01:15:09.872 --> 01:15:13.641
- Go to the drive-in...

01:15:13.643 --> 01:15:15.877
To our spot.

01:15:15.879 --> 01:15:17.612
- Okay.

01:15:17.614 --> 01:15:20.047
- There's a bag...

01:15:20.049 --> 01:15:21.949
Buried.

01:15:24.720 --> 01:15:26.821
Find it.

01:15:26.823 --> 01:15:28.623
- Okay.

01:15:29.558 --> 01:15:31.726
Okay. Shhh...

01:15:31.728 --> 01:15:33.961
Shhh...

01:15:52.581 --> 01:15:54.315
No, please!

01:15:58.587 --> 01:16:00.821
I love you.

<i> Roxxy,</i>
<i> I don't know where to start.</i>

01:21:14.403 --> 01:21:16.604
<i> I was so wrong.</i>

01:21:16.606 --> 01:21:19.473
<i> I told you I was paid</i>

with no lights on.
What's wrong with you?

01:26:10.366 --> 01:26:13.901
- I was gonna park,
but I wasn't sure
if this was the right place.

01:26:15.537 --> 01:26:17.538
- Shit, the party rockin'.

01:26:17.540 --> 01:26:20.541
