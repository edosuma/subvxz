CORRECTIONAL FACILITY

00:36.600 --> 00:39.119
Pitbull, be careful.

00:39.200 --> 00:41.520
It's not like it used to be out here.

00:43.200 --> 00:45.439
May the Madonna go with you.

01:45.200 --> 01:46.359
Ciro!

01:48.000 --> 01:49.920
Is it really you?

01:50.719 --> 01:51.959
Let's go.

02:05.120 --> 02:11.000
GOMORRA

03:41.439 --> 03:43.800
We got something important to tell you.

03:45.960 --> 03:50.000
Genny stole the Levantes' shipment,
that's all people are talking about.

03:50.080 --> 03:52.639
He's building up again.

03:54.560 --> 03:57.120
Do you know what that means?

03:57.199 --> 03:58.639
If Gennaro comes back,

03:59.319 --> 04:02.000
his first whim will be to have our heads.

04:11.800 --> 04:14.960
If that's true,
it'd take a weight off my back.

04:44.480 --> 04:47.480
Pretty Eyes, you're not welcome here.

04:47.560 --> 04:50.480
I gotta speak to Gennaro Savastano,
it's important.

05:05.480 --> 05:06.519
Good morning.

05:08.839 --> 05:10.079
Don Genna'...

05:11.360 --> 05:14.040
They said no one could steal
the Levantes' shipment,

05:14.120 --> 05:18.199
but you gave proof
of what everybody was waiting for.

05:28.480 --> 05:31.920
When I came to you,
you didn't welcome me.

05:32.000 --> 05:34.319
We're desperate

05:34.399 --> 05:37.680
and without this shipment
things will get worse.

05:38.639 --> 05:42.560
You know what I'm risking
being here, but I decided.

05:43.680 --> 05:47.079
If you still want me, I'm on your side.

05:49.079 --> 05:51.519
You gotta deserve it.

05:51.600 --> 05:55.079
Anything for you, Don Genna',
I'm at your disposal.

05:58.839 --> 06:00.439
Goodbye.

06:13.279 --> 06:15.360
You really trust him?

06:16.959 --> 06:19.439
We're his only hope.

07:10.199 --> 07:11.800
Sit down.

07:12.600 --> 07:14.600
Know what we thought?

07:15.839 --> 07:20.160
That maybe Gennaro didn't steal
the shipment, but he bought it.

07:20.800 --> 07:24.399
So the Gentleman earned twice:
with us and with him.

07:24.480 --> 07:26.120
You're accusing me.

07:26.199 --> 07:28.800
The load was in my hands,
I've lost millions.

07:31.160 --> 07:33.480
Who says Gennaro
didn't give you the money?

07:38.399 --> 07:42.120
My track record says so,
not to mention the fact

07:42.199 --> 07:45.199
that no one has pointed a gun
at your head yet.

07:45.279 --> 07:47.160
There's only one truth.

07:48.480 --> 07:52.519
You let them steal the shipment
and now Gennaro is stronger.

07:56.480 --> 07:57.519
So?

08:01.240 --> 08:04.839
This is a huge problem, for everyone.

08:06.560 --> 08:09.040
You gotta help us to kill him.

08:10.439 --> 08:12.839
You can't pull back.

08:47.600 --> 08:49.759
What's going on, Vince'?

08:52.600 --> 08:56.519
When our son died you swore
you'd always tell me the truth.

09:01.559 --> 09:03.879
I have to honor a debt.

09:03.960 --> 09:06.840
I sided with them
against Gennaro Savastano.

09:08.200 --> 09:10.480
This is something too big,

09:10.559 --> 09:14.279
it's not worth the debt we have
and that doesn't concern us.

09:15.480 --> 09:19.159
Our name concerns us.

09:19.960 --> 09:23.519
Right, you gave your word...

09:25.039 --> 09:27.480
and you're the Gentleman.

09:28.039 --> 09:30.519
I've heard this song before.

09:32.480 --> 09:34.519
You should have said no.

09:35.639 --> 09:37.559
Forget about pride.

09:39.080 --> 09:41.919
We'll pay our debt like we always have.

09:43.120 --> 09:45.480
The Gentleman does not pull back.

09:45.559 --> 09:48.759
I won't let them
put their feet on my head.

09:52.559 --> 09:56.559
And let's hope the Gentleman
has decided well for all of us.

10:08.440 --> 10:12.919
The Gentleman gave his word, he sided
with the Levantes against Gennaro.

10:13.000 --> 10:16.440
We get a month's pay
and a shipment by the end of the month.

10:16.519 --> 10:19.559
Lil Monk, what Gennaro did was serious.

10:19.639 --> 10:21.519
We pay the price more than anyone.

10:22.000 --> 10:24.000
We gotta stay loyal.

10:24.080 --> 10:28.399
- After that we'll all be stronger.
- Really?

10:28.480 --> 10:31.080
We gotta stay chained up like dogs?

10:32.879 --> 10:35.600
And if Gennaro wants
to sell us his stuff?

10:38.879 --> 10:40.799
- What do we tell him?
- Tell him no.

10:40.879 --> 10:42.080
Why?

10:42.519 --> 10:45.559
If you get it from Gennaro,
you pay twice.

10:45.639 --> 10:48.200
Once to him and once to us.

10:49.039 --> 10:52.200
Lil Monk, that pretty woman
they put in your bed

10:52.279 --> 10:54.000
has turned you inside out.

10:54.320 --> 10:58.200
If we stay with you
maybe we're picking the wrong side.

10:58.679 --> 11:00.919
I'm doing what's best for everyone.

11:03.480 --> 11:07.320
Lil Monk, I've never
taken charity from anyone.

11:09.519 --> 11:11.120
Tell that to your bosses.

11:16.440 --> 11:17.600
Goodbye.

11:53.399 --> 11:54.799
Good evening.

11:59.720 --> 12:01.879
Don't move, asshole.

12:28.120 --> 12:30.360
From the Gentleman.

12:30.759 --> 12:33.279
This is how you end up
if you deal with Savastano.

12:39.000 --> 12:41.919
They killed Pretty Eyes in his own turf.

12:42.000 --> 12:45.000
He was one of the Gentleman's men.

12:45.080 --> 12:47.600
You're right: they're killing each other.

12:51.120 --> 12:52.879
It's still not enough.

12:53.639 --> 12:56.159
The time's come to make our move.

13:13.519 --> 13:14.559
Handsome!

13:17.440 --> 13:19.639
Don't you think about me anymore?

13:21.159 --> 13:23.080
How you doing?

13:25.200 --> 13:26.919
You're so handsome.

13:50.759 --> 13:54.399
Your brother won't have him in the house,
so you come here on Saturdays.

13:56.919 --> 13:59.440
My mom had a dog too.

14:00.360 --> 14:04.039
She always said
they're loyal, intelligent creatures.

14:08.679 --> 14:10.840
And what's Lil Monk like?

14:12.080 --> 14:14.399
More loyal or more intelligent?

14:16.399 --> 14:18.559
We gotta make him see reason.

14:18.919 --> 14:21.399
I'll speak to him tonight, I swear.

14:24.759 --> 14:26.039
Tonight...

14:37.799 --> 14:40.759
You're not going anywhere tonight.

14:58.600 --> 15:00.879
Are you Enzo Blue Blood?

15:03.360 --> 15:05.120
Who wants to know?

15:05.200 --> 15:07.320
Someone who wants to see you.

15:13.679 --> 15:15.559
But I don't want to see anyone.

15:16.639 --> 15:19.000
Then this person is right,

15:19.080 --> 15:22.519
that night, on that boat,
you're the one who died.

15:33.080 --> 15:37.000
Tell Gennaro that he has
to come and get what he wants,

15:37.080 --> 15:39.000
I'll be waiting.

15:39.080 --> 15:42.399
It wasn't Gennaro Savastano
who sent me.

17:08.400 --> 17:11.200
My place in hell wasn't ready yet.

17:23.200 --> 17:26.119
I saw you die on that boat.

17:37.160 --> 17:39.279
Are you alive or are you dead?

17:46.400 --> 17:48.240
Are you alive or are you dead?

17:50.519 --> 17:52.039
I'm alive,

17:53.640 --> 17:55.960
but only now that I see you.

17:57.039 --> 17:59.880
Though you still haven't decided
who you wanna be.

18:03.279 --> 18:05.400
I wanna be like you.

18:13.759 --> 18:15.559
Then you gotta die too.

18:23.680 --> 18:25.599
That's what I want.

18:48.240 --> 18:50.359
Toni', gimme a cigarette.

18:53.519 --> 18:55.200
Take it easy with the wine.

18:56.519 --> 18:57.680
It's good.

19:08.279 --> 19:09.720
Thank you.

19:21.880 --> 19:23.480
I'd like to say a couple of words.

19:27.400 --> 19:31.079
After all the mourning
that broke all our hearts,

19:33.559 --> 19:35.839
today the Levantes are celebrating.

19:37.880 --> 19:40.559
We welcome Federico into our family.

19:41.720 --> 19:44.119
For us he's a new brother

19:44.200 --> 19:46.720
and he joins his life with Grazia's
in front of God.

19:49.039 --> 19:51.920
Grazie', if Mamma and Papa
were here with us,

19:53.119 --> 19:54.839
they'd be proud of you.

19:59.519 --> 20:02.640
Federi', now and for ever
this will be your family.

20:03.000 --> 20:04.720
Congratulations!

20:06.319 --> 20:07.920
May they be all sons!

20:26.359 --> 20:28.720
I'm going for a smoke, will you join me?

20:28.799 --> 20:31.000
- No, it seems rude.
- Come on.

20:32.480 --> 20:34.319
Humor me.

20:38.960 --> 20:42.799
- Where are you going?
- Let them get some air!

20:42.880 --> 20:45.160
You're like a watchdog.

20:52.799 --> 20:56.759
Will you quit throwing bread?
It's a sin against God.

21:02.400 --> 21:05.079
- You cold?
- No.

21:14.480 --> 21:15.880
Listen...

21:19.200 --> 21:23.000
- Why don't we just go?
- What? They're here for us.

21:26.880 --> 21:30.400
This isn't to celebrate us,
it's a business meeting.

21:31.240 --> 21:33.119
and the deal's already been made.

21:34.720 --> 21:37.079
I want to be alone with you.

22:36.240 --> 22:37.400
No!

23:23.039 --> 23:24.400
Stop!

23:27.720 --> 23:29.880
- Stop.
- Leave me alone!

23:29.960 --> 23:32.039
- Listen to me.
- Keep away!

23:32.119 --> 23:34.400
- Listen to me!
- You're hurting me.

23:34.480 --> 23:35.920
Come here.

23:36.000 --> 23:38.160
I did it to protect you.

23:40.039 --> 23:43.839
They only gave me this one chance
to save your life.

23:44.880 --> 23:46.319
You hear me?

23:51.799 --> 23:53.519
Stay with me.

23:55.119 --> 23:57.279
Away from everything and everyone.

23:58.440 --> 24:00.440
You can make a life for yourself.

24:02.200 --> 24:03.720
Our life.

24:11.519 --> 24:13.400
Only ours.

24:16.759 --> 24:18.880
Are you serious?

24:23.079 --> 24:25.079
Did you really believe it?

24:26.319 --> 24:29.880
You're the same as every other man
I've met in my life.

24:32.839 --> 24:35.160
At the first chance,
I would've killed you.

24:37.240 --> 24:39.839
To finally feel free.

24:42.759 --> 24:44.920
You gross me out.

25:33.039 --> 25:34.839
TP CONSULTANCY

25:42.559 --> 25:44.559
- Hi, Tizia'.
- Hi, Genna'.

25:45.400 --> 25:46.799
How are you?

25:48.480 --> 25:49.559
Good.

25:51.759 --> 25:55.839
- Any news about the consortium?
- No, it's still stalled.

25:56.359 --> 25:59.720
But I keep Azzurra updated,
it's her signature on the paperwork.

26:00.880 --> 26:02.960
Good, keep her informed.

26:03.759 --> 26:07.839
The judges must think
I'm not making any moves.

26:07.920 --> 26:09.039
Whereas?

26:10.119 --> 26:12.200
Whereas we're moving.

26:14.480 --> 26:17.359
How much money can we get
out of the consortium?

26:17.920 --> 26:21.079
I need to do an estimate...
ten mill I think.

26:22.400 --> 26:24.240
I need it right now.

26:26.920 --> 26:29.319
- Make some calls.
- All right.

26:30.880 --> 26:31.880
Counting on it.

27:32.640 --> 27:35.039
Well? See how nice it is?

27:39.559 --> 27:42.599
The bedrooms are up there,
on the first floor.

27:43.720 --> 27:46.000
There are two rooms.

27:46.079 --> 27:48.640
There's a nice room
for you and your wife

27:48.720 --> 27:50.400
and another one for the boy.

27:52.160 --> 27:55.279
There's a terrific kitchen
with lots of light.

27:56.400 --> 27:59.440
You can put a nice table
in front of the window.

27:59.519 --> 28:01.440
There's a terrace with a view.

28:02.200 --> 28:04.079
And there's a fireplace too.

28:04.839 --> 28:08.079
Look at the living room,
it's full of light.

28:09.880 --> 28:12.720
You could put a sofa there,

28:12.799 --> 28:16.480
then we can put a rug,
a nice table with chairs.

28:17.720 --> 28:20.559
Look how big the TV is.

28:22.319 --> 28:24.039
Well?

28:24.119 --> 28:26.000
Do you like it?

28:26.079 --> 28:27.880
It's exactly what I wanted.

28:33.599 --> 28:35.759
We're pleased you like the house.

28:38.119 --> 28:41.680
But it's a pity
that we're moving so far away.

28:43.240 --> 28:45.799
It's a pity and a risk for you.

28:45.880 --> 28:47.119
And for the boy.

28:50.279 --> 28:52.440
We killed the Levantes
in their own home,

28:54.039 --> 28:56.240
betrayed by an ally of theirs.

28:57.359 --> 28:58.799
You know what that means?

28:59.759 --> 29:02.599
Gennaro Savastano
can reach anywhere he wants.

29:07.000 --> 29:08.880
And you with me.

29:12.000 --> 29:14.759
There's still one thing left to do
before we're free.

29:29.200 --> 29:32.799
- My dear Don Vincenzo!
- It's a great pleasure to see you.

29:32.880 --> 29:36.039
- This year we outdid ourselves.
- You do that every year.

29:36.880 --> 29:39.200
You've spoiled me.

29:39.279 --> 29:42.000
If we may, it's complimentary.

29:42.440 --> 29:46.000
Then on Sunday make a nice offering
to the souls in purgatory.

29:46.079 --> 29:48.319
You'll be served with all our heart.

29:48.400 --> 29:50.400
Thank you, Don Vince'.

29:50.480 --> 29:52.880
- Have a nice day.
- Stay well.

29:53.799 --> 29:55.200
Good morning.

30:57.240 --> 30:59.079
May I?

31:33.759 --> 31:36.480
Signora Avitabile,
there's a parcel for you.

31:38.240 --> 31:40.920
I'll be right back, sweetie,
keep playing.

32:41.599 --> 32:44.519
Why'd you bring us to this shithole?

33:02.759 --> 33:04.319
Is it you?

33:13.440 --> 33:16.039
I've felt alone all my life.

33:18.039 --> 33:20.599
But now I look you in the eye
and I realize.

33:22.640 --> 33:25.960
I'm not alone, I've got you.

33:29.960 --> 33:33.240
The guy I used to call my brother
is now my enemy.

33:34.880 --> 33:37.440
Gennaro's got so many soldiers, huh?

33:41.039 --> 33:43.000
But he's got no companions.

33:43.079 --> 33:45.200
This is our strength.

33:48.440 --> 33:52.880
Each of us has a good reason
to bring this situation to an end.

33:57.039 --> 33:58.319
I'm with you.

34:04.200 --> 34:06.000
I'm with you, Ciro.

34:10.320 --> 34:12.039
I'm with you.

34:44.719 --> 34:46.760
What did I tell you?

34:51.000 --> 34:54.360
Now that I'm back, if anyone
doesn't agree, speak up.

35:01.800 --> 35:03.159
Good.

35:05.920 --> 35:08.719
I'll explain how things'll be
from now on.

35:08.800 --> 35:11.559
The cocaine
will be handed over to you,

35:11.639 --> 35:13.599
the spots gotta get working again.

35:13.679 --> 35:16.719
You still give me the same cut,
no increase.

35:16.800 --> 35:21.000
The system goes back how it was and
the earnings are the same for everybody.

35:21.480 --> 35:22.800
All right?

35:26.400 --> 35:28.800
There's only one more matter
to figure out.

35:30.719 --> 35:32.679
There's nothing to figure out.

35:35.800 --> 35:38.599
Only one person
deserves Pretty Eyes turf.

35:56.400 --> 35:57.840
Lil Monk.

36:06.119 --> 36:08.199
Maybe many of you already know me,

36:10.400 --> 36:13.639
but today I speak to you
businessman to businessman.

36:13.719 --> 36:17.519
Like you, I know how hard it is
to turn a business

36:17.599 --> 36:20.119
into a highlight for our territory.

36:20.199 --> 36:23.440
Get to the point, Don Genna'.
Whaddaya want from us?

36:25.880 --> 36:28.599
To acquire part of your business.

36:28.679 --> 36:31.840
We need investment
to increase quality.

36:34.320 --> 36:37.920
In those bags there's
a million euros for each of you.

36:40.559 --> 36:42.639
Whadda we gotta do in return?

36:42.719 --> 36:45.199
Use your poor-quality material

36:45.280 --> 36:49.639
and hire people off the books
that you sell jobs to?

36:50.559 --> 36:52.559
I'm not my father.

36:55.360 --> 36:59.840
He destroyed businesses
he took over, I don't.

37:00.679 --> 37:05.360
I'll only want a share of your business
equal to the sum I invested.

37:05.440 --> 37:08.280
So we can help you launder dirty money.

37:09.559 --> 37:13.679
All money is dirty,
it makes men do the worst things.

38:33.400 --> 38:35.039
So?

38:35.119 --> 38:37.199
The courier brought a package.

39:16.760 --> 39:18.599
I've always told you...

39:19.480 --> 39:22.079
I can knot a tie better.

39:24.480 --> 39:26.079
Light of my life.

39:35.440 --> 39:37.639
The undertakers have arrived.

39:53.480 --> 39:56.840
Gennaro Savastano's got
a wife and kid, right?

40:15.320 --> 40:17.079
Let's go home!

40:24.039 --> 40:25.400
Bye, Francesco.

40:26.519 --> 40:30.000
- Is Pietro still inside?
- No, he went out with my colleague.

40:30.079 --> 40:32.519
I'll go and check if you like.

40:32.599 --> 40:34.360
Never mind.

40:49.960 --> 40:51.760
Have you seen my son?

40:51.840 --> 40:54.280
Take a look down there
in the changing room.

40:56.480 --> 40:57.719
Pietro?

42:42.920 --> 42:44.360
Good evening, Raffae'.

42:44.440 --> 42:46.760
- All good, King?
- All good.

42:48.199 --> 42:49.679
Open it.

43:06.920 --> 43:09.480
Don Gennaro always keeps his word.

43:09.559 --> 43:13.360
Tell Don Gennaro we missed
the Savastanos a lot.

43:19.519 --> 43:20.760
Shut up!

43:20.840 --> 43:23.000
- Put the gun down!
- Who are you?

43:23.079 --> 43:24.880
I don't know you.

43:52.519 --> 43:54.400
This can't be,

43:55.320 --> 43:57.079
you're dead.

43:58.000 --> 43:59.920
Whaddaya want from us?

44:00.840 --> 44:02.559
I don't want anything from you,

44:03.079 --> 44:05.960
I just wanna
send a message to Gennaro.

44:10.559 --> 44:13.119
I needed one from Ponticelli
and one from Scampia.

45:01.559 --> 45:07.119
THE IMMORTAL IS BACK

45:39.360 --> 45:41.559
IN THE NEXT EPISODE
