00:28.369 --> 00:30.437
<i>"Dearest Mina.</i>

00:30.471 --> 00:33.108
<i>Forgive me for taking
so long to write back.</i>

00:33.807 --> 00:37.344
<i>I'm so sorry to hear of
Jonathan's recent illness.</i>

00:37.377 --> 00:39.379
<i>I hope he'll soon be well,</i>

00:39.413 --> 00:42.183
<i>and you'll both be able to
visit me at Hillingham House.</i>

00:43.150 --> 00:45.653
<i>I've actually been
quite unwell myself.</i>

00:46.419 --> 00:49.623
<i>Arthur says it's just
pre-wedding nerves,</i>

00:49.657 --> 00:52.827
<i>but I know he worries
about me all the same.</i>

00:52.859 --> 00:55.929
<i>I'm still quite certain
I made the right choice,</i>

00:55.962 --> 00:58.733
<i>though it wasn't an easy one.</i>

00:58.766 --> 01:03.471
<i>Can you imagine receiving two
marriage proposals in one day?"</i>

01:45.478 --> 01:47.781
John, thank you
for coming over.

01:47.814 --> 01:49.649
Sorry about the hour.

01:49.683 --> 01:51.719
There's no need to keep
a low profile, John.

01:51.752 --> 01:55.323
No, no, it's just there's
a particular patient of mine

01:55.356 --> 01:57.358
I've been studying
quite closely.

01:57.391 --> 01:59.526
- Fascinating behaviour...
- It's Lucy.

02:00.261 --> 02:01.930
She's not well.

02:02.362 --> 02:04.632
She insists there's
nothing wrong with her.

02:06.433 --> 02:09.637
But I think she might just
talk to you.

02:10.536 --> 02:11.706
Please.

02:27.020 --> 02:28.322
Lucy?

02:29.690 --> 02:31.226
May I come in?

02:37.665 --> 02:38.833
Lucy!

04:46.493 --> 04:48.529
Professor Van Helsing!

04:48.562 --> 04:50.398
John, my friend!

04:50.964 --> 04:53.534
I can't begin to tell you
how grateful I am.

04:53.567 --> 04:55.569
I'm really just looking
for a second opinion.

04:55.601 --> 04:57.637
And what is
your initial opinion?

04:57.671 --> 05:00.774
I don't have one.
The poor girl, she's so weak

05:00.808 --> 05:02.909
and, for the life of me,
I can't find the cause of it.

05:02.942 --> 05:04.779
Poor girl?

05:04.812 --> 05:08.849
Now I understand the concern
expressed in your telegram.

05:08.882 --> 05:13.120
This "dear friend" is
more than a friend, perhaps?

05:13.152 --> 05:14.687
No.

05:14.721 --> 05:16.624
She's engaged to be married.

05:16.656 --> 05:17.957
To someone else.

05:17.990 --> 05:21.895
So, your concern
is purely professional?

05:21.928 --> 05:24.764
Well, let's just say
the matter of her engagement

05:24.798 --> 05:27.735
has only recently been decided

05:27.767 --> 05:29.803
and not in my favour.

05:29.837 --> 05:32.539
I see. The lucky gentleman?

05:33.072 --> 05:36.510
Arthur Holmwood.
A fine young man.

05:36.543 --> 05:38.779
This is his house. Well...

05:38.812 --> 05:41.716
- One of them.
- And what of the girl herself?

05:42.783 --> 05:46.086
You've never seen a girl
so vivacious, so full of life.

05:46.118 --> 05:47.654
Attractive?

05:47.687 --> 05:50.690
- Well, it's not for me to say.
- I see.

05:50.724 --> 05:52.692
Very attractive.

05:52.726 --> 05:55.463
And where might I find
the young Miss...?

05:55.495 --> 05:57.664
Lucy Westenra.

05:57.697 --> 05:59.032
This way.

06:14.947 --> 06:16.616
Arthur?

06:16.649 --> 06:18.084
Is that you?

06:19.685 --> 06:21.121
Come here and hold me.

06:24.024 --> 06:26.226
I'm sorry to disappoint you,
my dear.

06:26.260 --> 06:29.062
I'm told Arthur
will be along shortly.

06:30.764 --> 06:33.935
My name is Van Helsing.

06:34.567 --> 06:36.937
Your friend Dr Seward
seems to think

06:36.969 --> 06:38.940
I might be of some assistance.

06:39.774 --> 06:42.643
I came back as quickly
as I could.

06:45.012 --> 06:47.781
- Is your man here?
- He's upstairs tending to Lucy.

06:48.882 --> 06:51.218
- Tell me about him.
- Van Helsing?

06:51.250 --> 06:53.553
He's my oldest friend
and master.

06:53.587 --> 06:56.589
But he is a qualified
medical doctor?

06:56.623 --> 06:59.093
That and much more than,
Arthur.

06:59.860 --> 07:02.763
I'm quite sure I'll be right
as rain in a day or two.

07:03.296 --> 07:06.000
I'd hate for you to have
troubled yourself for no reason.

07:06.033 --> 07:10.271
Your friend Dr Seward was
concerned enough to send for me,

07:10.303 --> 07:13.806
and his concern is reason
enough for me to come.

07:13.839 --> 07:18.077
And meeting you is reason
enough not to object, my dear.

07:18.111 --> 07:21.048
John is such a sweet fellow.

07:21.080 --> 07:23.583
He worries about me too much.

07:23.616 --> 07:26.185
I do hope you'll be able to
reassure him nothing's wrong.

07:26.219 --> 07:30.791
Well, I agree nothing seems to
be wrong with your temperature,

07:30.824 --> 07:32.593
pulse or breathing.

07:35.161 --> 07:36.763
And yet...

07:38.130 --> 07:39.899
How is your appetite?

07:39.933 --> 07:42.202
Normal, I think.

07:42.235 --> 07:45.573
Some days I'm quite ravenous,

07:45.606 --> 07:47.942
but then when the food is
presented it rather seems to...

07:49.175 --> 07:50.945
lose its appeal.

07:51.777 --> 07:53.647
And how do you sleep?

07:53.680 --> 07:54.982
Quite well.

07:55.815 --> 07:58.652
They do say I used to
walk in my sleep.

07:59.320 --> 08:01.120
I once made it right
out the house

08:01.154 --> 08:03.923
down the street
and only in my nightgown.

08:03.957 --> 08:05.858
I don't do that anymore.

08:05.892 --> 08:09.262
Though I do have the most
extraordinary dreams lately.

08:09.296 --> 08:11.332
Extraordinary in what way?

08:11.365 --> 08:14.368
I can hardly explain it, but...

08:16.002 --> 08:18.938
When I wake up, I barely
seem to know where I am,

08:18.971 --> 08:23.577
and part of whatever I was
dreaming on seems to linger.

08:24.377 --> 08:26.613
And you cannot describe it?

08:27.247 --> 08:30.818
When I first wake up
it's completely vivid,

08:30.851 --> 08:32.919
then moments later it's gone

08:32.953 --> 08:35.155
and I can't recall a thing
no matter how hard I try.

08:35.955 --> 08:39.826
There may be a way
in which I can assist you.

08:40.594 --> 08:44.164
Are you familiar with
the concept of hypnosis?

08:44.196 --> 08:48.368
John... Dr Seward
had mentioned it once.

08:48.401 --> 08:51.704
But I didn't think it
was highly regarded?

08:51.738 --> 08:55.108
In medical circles,
indeed it is not,

08:55.142 --> 08:58.679
but in the understanding
of sleep phenomena,

08:58.711 --> 09:02.115
and of dreams,
it can be most useful.

09:02.682 --> 09:05.352
Would you permit me to try?

09:13.993 --> 09:16.696
I sometimes wonder if this
constant battery of tests

09:16.729 --> 09:19.298
is doing Lucy
more harm than good.

09:19.331 --> 09:21.334
Van Helsing knows
what he's doing.

09:21.368 --> 09:23.304
The man is quite brilliant.

09:24.570 --> 09:28.975
I'll admit he may come across as
somewhat arbitrary at times, but...

09:29.008 --> 09:31.210
Arbitrary? You mean eccentric.

09:31.243 --> 09:32.680
I wouldn't go that far.

09:33.747 --> 09:38.017
Trust me, Art, the man has more
knowledge of obscure diseases

09:38.050 --> 09:40.153
than anyone else on Earth.

09:41.787 --> 09:44.190
Concentrate on the eye.

09:44.224 --> 09:47.027
Not on the watch, just the eye.

09:52.733 --> 09:56.170
I'm going to count backwards
now, starting at ten.

09:57.369 --> 10:00.740
I want you to listen to me
while I count.

10:02.908 --> 10:06.379
I want you to feel all
your troubles and concerns

10:06.412 --> 10:11.017
leaving you and flying out
through the window.

10:14.454 --> 10:16.022
Ten.

10:18.257 --> 10:19.392
Nine.

10:24.430 --> 10:25.932
Eight.

10:32.238 --> 10:33.873
Seven.

10:44.383 --> 10:47.353
Lucy? Are you comfortable?

10:50.223 --> 10:51.425
Yes.

10:54.294 --> 10:58.332
I would like to take you
back in time, several hours.

11:01.001 --> 11:03.203
It is midnight.

11:03.235 --> 11:05.839
You are lying in this bed.

11:07.840 --> 11:10.477
What do you see?

11:11.411 --> 11:13.113
Not in bed.

11:14.247 --> 11:18.853
Feel the air...
cool air on my face.

11:20.119 --> 11:23.289
You are outside, in the street?

11:24.357 --> 11:26.260
In the street.

11:26.993 --> 11:29.028
In the air.

11:29.829 --> 11:31.364
Many places.

11:33.900 --> 11:35.770
Are you lost?

11:36.368 --> 11:37.537
No.

11:40.105 --> 11:44.544
Are you...
desirous of something?

11:45.978 --> 11:48.448
Is there something you seek?

11:48.480 --> 11:49.849
Yes.

11:53.420 --> 11:55.222
What is it?

12:03.229 --> 12:04.897
What about the wedding?

12:04.930 --> 12:07.001
Have the two of you
set a date yet?

12:08.535 --> 12:11.371
Well, Lucy's keen
on September 28th,

12:11.403 --> 12:13.840
but that was before all this.

12:14.474 --> 12:16.410
I'm not sure if
she'll be well enough

12:16.443 --> 12:18.377
to deal with all
the arrangements.

12:18.411 --> 12:21.147
Oh, I can't imagine her illness
will last as long as all that.

12:21.180 --> 12:23.416
Be honest with me, John.

12:23.450 --> 12:26.820
It must be serious or you wouldn't have
sent for this Professor Van Helsing.

12:27.520 --> 12:30.891
Not serious, just perplexing.

12:30.924 --> 12:32.559
Yes, well...

12:32.592 --> 12:35.362
I just hope he's got
something to say for himself.

12:42.167 --> 12:44.503
Professor, this is Arthur
Holmwood, Lucy's fiancé.

12:44.536 --> 12:46.607
A pleasure, sir.

12:46.640 --> 12:50.344
Well, John, I thank you again
for your telegram,

12:50.377 --> 12:53.647
but I'm afraid our time
together today must be brief.

12:53.680 --> 12:57.017
I must return to my study
this evening.

12:57.050 --> 12:58.584
A pleasure, sir.

12:58.618 --> 13:01.321
But, Professor,
what do you make of Lucy?

13:02.321 --> 13:05.658
Ah, a most charming young lady.

13:05.691 --> 13:08.361
I can see why you,

13:08.395 --> 13:13.000
both of you, should be so
concerned as to her well-being.

13:13.032 --> 13:15.002
Yes, but what is your diagnosis?

13:15.035 --> 13:16.237
Diagnosis?

13:17.436 --> 13:19.672
Oh... I...

13:19.705 --> 13:23.042
concur with
Dr Seward's analysis.

13:24.074 --> 13:25.579
- Now, if you will excuse me...
- Is that all?

13:26.313 --> 13:28.482
With all due respect,
Professor...

13:28.515 --> 13:30.951
The... the carriage has been
waiting quite some time.

13:30.983 --> 13:32.451
I... No need to see me out.

13:32.484 --> 13:34.888
I'm sure you have
much to attend to.

13:39.559 --> 13:42.262
I told you he can be arbitrary.

13:43.296 --> 13:48.067
You call that arbitrary?
I call it downright strange.

14:04.584 --> 14:06.553
It was fine, darling.

14:06.585 --> 14:09.522
He was quite the gentleman,
I can assure you.

14:09.555 --> 14:12.091
It's not that.
I just worry about his methods.

14:12.124 --> 14:15.127
It all sounds
very pseudoscientific.

14:15.161 --> 14:17.631
And he doesn't seem to
have achieved anything at all.

14:17.664 --> 14:20.600
- Not even with the hypnosis?
- What?

14:20.632 --> 14:25.672
He hypnotised me. Just
for a few moments, I think.

14:28.108 --> 14:29.443
Really, darling,

14:29.475 --> 14:31.344
I didn't feel a thing.

14:33.680 --> 14:36.349
Lucy says that man
hypnotised her.

14:36.382 --> 14:40.119
- It's not a new technique.
- It's a disreputable technique.

14:40.152 --> 14:42.154
I once saw a demonstration

14:42.188 --> 14:44.524
where a so-called hypnotist

14:44.556 --> 14:47.026
had a man believing
he was a chicken.

14:47.060 --> 14:48.462
A parlour trick, Arthur.

14:49.762 --> 14:53.300
Well, may I politely request

14:53.333 --> 14:57.671
that I be present
at any future examinations

14:57.704 --> 15:00.340
this man takes of Lucy.

16:57.790 --> 16:59.860
You did the right thing.

16:59.892 --> 17:01.762
I'll summon the Professor
at once.

17:08.634 --> 17:10.703
Good morning, my friend.

17:10.737 --> 17:12.404
Professor, I was just about
to send for you.

17:12.438 --> 17:13.772
I took the earliest train.

17:13.805 --> 17:16.242
But how did you know?

17:22.648 --> 17:25.352
There is a pulse, but it's weak.

17:25.384 --> 17:27.685
We need to set up a medical bay.

17:27.719 --> 17:30.257
I have the necessary
equipment downstairs.

17:31.723 --> 17:34.593
If we act quickly,
we can help her.

17:34.626 --> 17:37.563
We can use the old chapel.
I'll tell the maid.

17:47.440 --> 17:51.577
The only thing that will save
her is a transfusion of blood.

17:51.611 --> 17:53.246
Wait!

17:53.278 --> 17:55.748
Do you intend to do it yourself?

17:55.782 --> 17:58.785
I mean, give her your own blood?

17:58.817 --> 18:02.488
There is no time to make
other considerations.

18:02.521 --> 18:04.723
But you're forgetting me.

18:04.757 --> 18:07.326
Please, Professor, I'm fit.

18:07.360 --> 18:09.763
It's the least
I can do for Lucy.

18:09.796 --> 18:12.899
Do you speak as her physician
or as her friend?

18:12.931 --> 18:14.700
What does it matter?

18:14.734 --> 18:17.537
It might matter to Arthur -

18:17.569 --> 18:19.772
to think of another man's
blood running through

18:19.805 --> 18:21.575
the veins of his beloved.

18:21.607 --> 18:23.943
A rival in her affections, even.

18:23.977 --> 18:26.213
Nonsense,
that's all in the past.

18:26.246 --> 18:28.848
My only concern now
is what's best for Lucy.

18:28.881 --> 18:32.518
Anyway, Arthur needn't
know all the details.

18:33.686 --> 18:35.522
Then lie down here next to her.

18:51.871 --> 18:53.873
Try to relax the arm.

18:57.442 --> 19:00.279
She requires a lot of blood.

19:00.313 --> 19:01.882
You will be here
for some time.

19:10.390 --> 19:13.360
Afraid of the sight of
a little blood, John?

19:13.392 --> 19:15.895
Only when it's my own,
Professor.

19:48.694 --> 19:51.964
Now, I have more studying
of my own to do.

19:51.998 --> 19:53.866
You're leaving us like this?

19:53.900 --> 19:56.803
You have your notes
to pass the time.

19:56.835 --> 19:59.738
There is nothing further
I can do here for the moment.

19:59.771 --> 20:02.875
Lucy will improve over time.

20:02.909 --> 20:05.312
You, my friend, will not.

20:05.344 --> 20:07.447
So rest.

21:40.605 --> 21:41.775
Lucy?

21:53.052 --> 21:54.020
Oh, no!

22:06.665 --> 22:08.834
Lucy, what are you doing?

22:10.236 --> 22:12.171
Lucy, you're sleepwalking again.

22:15.941 --> 22:17.810
I missed you, darling.

22:19.245 --> 22:20.814
Where is she?

22:20.846 --> 22:24.950
Miss Lucy is resting
in the chapel.

22:25.817 --> 22:27.153
Dear God, no.

22:27.653 --> 22:31.557
Wait, sir, I...
I think you misunderstand me.

22:34.660 --> 22:35.961
What is this?

22:35.995 --> 22:38.931
- Arthur, I...
- Excellent, excellent.

22:38.965 --> 22:40.700
She is much improved.

22:41.400 --> 22:44.805
Remember what I told you,
John, don't move.

22:45.305 --> 22:48.541
The young doctor has performed
quite a service,

22:48.574 --> 22:51.978
giving up his own blood
to help Miss Lucy.

22:52.745 --> 22:55.916
I dare say he has this morning
saved her life.

22:56.815 --> 22:59.251
Oh... I see.

22:59.285 --> 23:01.220
And how are you feeling,
my dear?

23:01.254 --> 23:03.923
- Hungry.
- Wonderful.

23:03.956 --> 23:07.794
A healthy appetite is surely
a sign of good health.

23:08.728 --> 23:10.729
Mr Holmwood, sir,

23:10.763 --> 23:14.033
I believe the young lady is well
enough to return to her room.

23:14.065 --> 23:15.802
Right. Yes.

23:19.305 --> 23:20.539
Right.

23:22.909 --> 23:26.246
- Are you still hungry?
- Ravenous.

23:26.278 --> 23:28.647
I'll fetch something
from the kitchen.

23:31.816 --> 23:34.887
It's not food
I'm hungry for, Arthur.

23:40.593 --> 23:42.195
You should rest.

23:58.844 --> 24:00.212
Thank you, Professor.

24:00.246 --> 24:03.216
You did more to save
the girl than I did.

24:03.882 --> 24:07.786
That's not what I meant. I mean
the way you handled Arthur.

24:07.819 --> 24:10.188
I did nothing
but speak the truth.

24:10.221 --> 24:13.026
Thanks to your
donation of blood,

24:13.058 --> 24:16.529
Lucy is almost back
to normal and all is well.

24:18.331 --> 24:21.535
Did you learn anything at all
from the hypnosis?

24:22.934 --> 24:25.304
Nothing definite.

24:25.337 --> 24:28.274
Just another piece
to add to the puzzle.

24:29.208 --> 24:30.910
Why do you ask?

24:30.942 --> 24:34.881
I'm still not quite sure
about the state of her mind.

24:35.514 --> 24:38.552
- She seems confused.
- Naturally.

24:40.085 --> 24:42.255
A temporary lack of blood
to the brain

24:42.287 --> 24:44.723
will bring on
a little light-headedness.

24:44.757 --> 24:47.227
- You feel it yourself, I'm sure.
- Yes.

24:48.294 --> 24:51.998
The best cure for it, I suggest,

24:52.030 --> 24:54.700
can be found
in the drawing room.

25:09.180 --> 25:12.884
I'm sure you recall, John,
that...

25:12.918 --> 25:15.787
I did ask - well, insist -

25:15.821 --> 25:21.026
that I be present at any future
intervention by Van Helsing?

25:21.059 --> 25:23.261
There was no time, Art.

25:23.295 --> 25:26.399
You should have seen Lucy this
morning, she was on the brink of death.

25:26.431 --> 25:29.768
But yesterday you said she was
fine, so did Van Helsing.

25:29.802 --> 25:32.105
We never said she was fine,

25:32.138 --> 25:33.906
just that we couldn't
find anything wrong with her.

25:33.939 --> 25:36.142
Isn't that the same thing?

25:37.176 --> 25:38.778
Apparently not.

25:44.249 --> 25:46.385
Yes, well...

25:54.192 --> 25:58.097
I must thank you
for your sacrifice, John.

25:58.832 --> 26:02.068
I'm sure you wouldn't have
hesitated to do the same thing.

26:02.101 --> 26:07.172
Well, absolutely.
She is MY fiancée, after all.

26:08.340 --> 26:10.843
Have you eaten?

26:10.875 --> 26:13.245
Mm, I was hungry earlier.

26:14.380 --> 26:17.283
No matter.

26:17.315 --> 26:21.120
Your colour is much improved
from this morning.

26:21.152 --> 26:23.088
I do feel better already.

26:23.122 --> 26:25.725
I'm very pleased to hear it.

26:25.757 --> 26:29.395
And now, I have something to
even further lighten your mood.

26:36.736 --> 26:38.470
For me?

26:38.504 --> 26:40.173
Of course, my dear.

26:40.206 --> 26:42.208
You're so sweet, Professor.

26:42.240 --> 26:43.975
I'll call the maid
to bring a vase.

26:44.008 --> 26:48.448
No need.
I shall place them here,

26:49.481 --> 26:51.283
if it so please you, my dear?

26:51.316 --> 26:54.921
If it so pleases you,
Professor, it pleases me.

26:55.787 --> 26:59.325
I'm afraid we are no closer
as to divining

26:59.357 --> 27:02.127
the cause of your illness.

27:02.161 --> 27:04.796
I wonder if you would
give me your consent

27:04.830 --> 27:07.133
to try the hypnosis, once again?

27:07.932 --> 27:11.237
It's clearly just a matter of
the lack of blood in her veins.

27:11.269 --> 27:13.305
But is there such a disease?

27:13.338 --> 27:15.507
That drains the blood
from the body

27:15.540 --> 27:18.009
without any outward sign of it?

27:18.043 --> 27:20.246
If there was, the Professor
would know of it.

27:20.278 --> 27:23.915
Well, perhaps he does know of it
and he's concealing it from us.

27:23.949 --> 27:26.219
You have to admit, he never
gives a straight answer.

27:26.251 --> 27:28.854
If he's made a diagnosis,
you'd be the first to know, Art.

27:29.622 --> 27:32.726
The only reason he might
hesitate is if he isn't sure.

27:33.359 --> 27:36.162
Especially if it's
something serious.

27:38.530 --> 27:41.233
Well, that doesn't exactly
put my mind at rest.

27:43.369 --> 27:44.771
Ten.

27:46.372 --> 27:48.041
Nine.

27:48.807 --> 27:50.042
Eight.

27:52.978 --> 27:54.147
Seven.

28:07.959 --> 28:09.261
Lucy?

28:10.930 --> 28:13.032
Can you hear me?

28:13.532 --> 28:14.934
Yes.

28:17.236 --> 28:19.439
Where are you now?

28:20.940 --> 28:22.776
In the air.

28:24.142 --> 28:26.011
You are in the air?

28:27.246 --> 28:29.415
I AM the air.

28:30.850 --> 28:32.952
I am the wind.

28:32.985 --> 28:35.854
The wolves, the night.

28:36.555 --> 28:39.057
Do you seek something?

28:41.059 --> 28:42.461
Yes.

28:43.295 --> 28:45.031
What do you seek?

28:45.930 --> 28:47.967
The thing that I need.

28:47.999 --> 28:51.003
What is it that you need?

28:51.970 --> 28:53.839
Blood.

29:36.215 --> 29:38.117
Well?

29:39.017 --> 29:40.886
She is sleeping.

29:40.920 --> 29:42.654
Her pulse is...

29:42.688 --> 29:45.358
weak but steady.

29:45.958 --> 29:48.928
I believe, after a night's rest,

29:50.062 --> 29:52.498
we will see her much improved.

29:52.530 --> 29:54.399
- I must see her.
- She's sleeping.

29:54.432 --> 29:55.267
Just...

29:56.501 --> 29:58.303
Just for a minute.

30:03.374 --> 30:06.011
He's beginning to lose patience
with all of this.

30:07.478 --> 30:09.481
I understand.

30:09.515 --> 30:12.919
He just wants Lucy well again.
We all do.

30:14.687 --> 30:20.359
As I said, I believe tomorrow
she will be much improved.

30:20.392 --> 30:22.195
How can you be sure?

30:23.962 --> 30:27.966
I have made certain precautions.

30:28.600 --> 30:32.205
If I'm correct, tomorrow
we will see the results.

30:38.477 --> 30:40.380
It's all very strange.

30:46.250 --> 30:49.120
She's even sleepwalking again.

30:49.153 --> 30:50.989
Sleepwalking?

30:53.057 --> 30:57.563
Well, she got up from the other
bed and lay down next to me.

30:58.998 --> 31:01.200
Is that all she did?

31:02.735 --> 31:04.137
Yes.

31:07.206 --> 31:08.440
Of course.

31:12.311 --> 31:17.150
But if Arthur hadn't
come in when he did...

31:18.383 --> 31:19.584
Yes?

31:30.228 --> 31:33.231
The girl has a power over you,
does she not?

31:54.553 --> 31:55.755
Lucy.

32:00.426 --> 32:01.794
Lucy.

32:01.826 --> 32:03.362
John?

32:03.394 --> 32:05.664
No, darling, it's me,
it's Arthur.

32:07.466 --> 32:09.068
Oh! Arthur.

32:09.668 --> 32:11.204
How do you feel?

32:11.769 --> 32:13.571
Stronger.

32:13.604 --> 32:16.709
I can feel the new blood
running through my veins.

32:19.577 --> 32:21.346
It's energising.

32:23.082 --> 32:27.053
Like... part of him
is inside of me.

32:32.623 --> 32:34.360
What are those flowers?

32:35.794 --> 32:37.595
The Professor gave them to me?

32:37.629 --> 32:40.199
Perhaps they needed
to be in some water?

32:41.632 --> 32:44.370
Ugh! They smell dreadful.

32:51.876 --> 32:54.346
I'll buy you fresh flowers
tomorrow.

32:55.146 --> 32:58.249
And the next day,
and the next day.

32:58.283 --> 33:01.120
Fresh flowers every day.

33:01.152 --> 33:03.623
Nothing's too good
for my fiancée.

33:07.426 --> 33:09.495
I'd do anything
to see you well again.

33:38.923 --> 33:40.792
Good morning, Professor.

33:40.825 --> 33:43.762
Indeed, I hope it will be, John.

33:44.896 --> 33:47.432
It is a magnificent property.

33:47.466 --> 33:49.401
Arthur's family home.

33:49.433 --> 33:52.671
Well, one of them.
He's a Lord-to-be, you know?

33:52.703 --> 33:54.906
His father is Lord Godalming.

33:54.940 --> 33:58.244
Owns this estate and
quite a lot more besides.

33:58.276 --> 34:00.546
Now I understand.

34:00.578 --> 34:02.413
Understand what?

34:02.447 --> 34:05.584
The young lady, Miss Lucy.

34:05.616 --> 34:09.154
She... seems
much attracted to you.

34:09.187 --> 34:12.724
And yet when the two of you
propose to her,

34:12.757 --> 34:15.159
she chooses Arthur.

34:15.194 --> 34:17.362
Now I understand.

34:17.395 --> 34:21.600
One day, she will be
Lady Godalming, am I right?

34:21.632 --> 34:22.801
Yes.

34:23.569 --> 34:27.206
This also has much attraction,
I think?

34:30.509 --> 34:32.378
I hadn't really
thought of it like that.

34:35.346 --> 34:37.350
Professor, come quickly!

34:47.592 --> 34:49.694
All the blood is gone!

34:51.730 --> 34:54.534
What happened
to the flowers I left?

34:55.301 --> 34:58.938
Another transfusion,
it's the only way. Arthur!

35:07.578 --> 35:11.883
I'd give every last drop
if it can help Lucy.

35:11.917 --> 35:14.353
I don't ask for that much.

35:14.819 --> 35:16.655
Not yet.

35:18.290 --> 35:19.959
Will it be enough to save her?

35:20.859 --> 35:22.828
There is a chance.

35:23.328 --> 35:25.431
I can only say a chance.

35:26.064 --> 35:28.600
- Keep still now.
- I'll do anything, Professor.

35:28.634 --> 35:30.303
I mean it.

35:30.968 --> 35:33.772
Relax the arm... please.

35:45.450 --> 35:47.553
I'd do anything for Lucy.

35:48.453 --> 35:53.692
You know, I couldn't believe it
when she accepted my proposal.

35:56.661 --> 35:59.864
Everyone used to say that she
and John make a perfect match,

35:59.897 --> 36:01.499
but...

36:03.768 --> 36:05.504
Just rest now.

36:11.643 --> 36:13.713
How long do you think
it'll take?

36:14.513 --> 36:16.248
The same as before.

36:17.415 --> 36:20.718
But I will return shortly
to monitor them.

36:20.752 --> 36:24.757
There may be a danger
when Lucy's strength returns

36:24.790 --> 36:27.593
in leaving her alone
with Arthur.

36:28.326 --> 36:29.562
Danger?

36:30.529 --> 36:32.564
The power she has.

36:32.596 --> 36:34.366
The power YOU felt.

36:35.067 --> 36:38.003
I'm sure Arthur feels it too,

36:38.035 --> 36:40.772
perhaps even more so.

36:42.774 --> 36:44.944
None of this makes any sense.

36:50.716 --> 36:52.584
Listen to me, John.

36:52.616 --> 36:56.488
Earlier today,
I examined Lucy's neck

36:56.520 --> 37:01.493
and I found, here,
two small puncture wounds.

37:02.227 --> 37:05.530
The choker she wears
hides them from view.

37:06.163 --> 37:08.366
What are they?
Some sort of bite?

37:09.968 --> 37:13.038
Some sort of bite, yes.

37:14.439 --> 37:17.310
You may be more right
than you know.

37:19.544 --> 37:23.082
I have considered this matter
for several days now.

37:23.114 --> 37:27.518
Last night, I was
almost sure of my diagnosis,

37:27.551 --> 37:31.890
and now today,
there can be no doubt.

37:34.459 --> 37:38.464
There is something in one of my
books I would like to show you.

37:53.645 --> 37:54.680
Lucy.

38:04.455 --> 38:06.424
This, John...

38:07.058 --> 38:09.962
this is what we are
dealing with.

38:09.995 --> 38:12.397
What do you mean?

38:13.098 --> 38:15.634
This isn't a book of medicine.

38:16.201 --> 38:19.036
It's a book of witchcraft.

38:19.069 --> 38:21.707
Yes, and much more besides.

38:23.073 --> 38:25.410
You're not seriously suggesting

38:25.444 --> 38:28.413
that Lucy's fallen
under some sort of curse?

38:29.513 --> 38:32.718
You forget that here we are,

38:32.750 --> 38:36.087
two men of science
and of medicine,

38:36.120 --> 38:38.689
who have failed to find a cure,

38:38.723 --> 38:41.192
not even a diagnosis
for Miss Lucy.

38:41.225 --> 38:43.060
But you said you did
have a diagnosis.

38:43.093 --> 38:45.864
Yes, and it is this.

38:49.533 --> 38:50.835
Don't move, darling.

38:53.705 --> 38:56.007
You'll soon be feeling stronger.

38:56.841 --> 38:59.911
Yes, I can feel it now...

39:00.812 --> 39:02.647
the blood,

39:02.681 --> 39:04.850
flowing into me.

39:06.750 --> 39:08.720
Filling me up.

39:11.156 --> 39:12.825
There! You see it?

39:12.857 --> 39:15.560
The loss of blood
without a drop spilled.

39:15.593 --> 39:17.462
By the night time, she recovers,

39:17.495 --> 39:19.831
and by the morning
a deathly pallor returns.

39:19.864 --> 39:24.102
Each and every mysterious symptom
we have encountered is explained.

39:24.134 --> 39:26.504
Can you doubt it?

39:26.538 --> 39:28.540
I'd sooner not be the
one to show this to Arthur.

39:28.573 --> 39:31.509
Arthur! I almost forgot!

39:31.542 --> 39:34.779
I'm really feeling
so much better now.

39:34.812 --> 39:36.914
You're still looking very pale.

39:36.948 --> 39:38.850
You should rest a little longer.

39:38.884 --> 39:42.154
- I don't want to rest!
- Lucy, be careful of the tube.

39:42.187 --> 39:44.223
Kiss me.

39:45.256 --> 39:48.192
- Lucy, the Professor said...
- Kiss me!

39:52.897 --> 39:53.698
No!

39:58.136 --> 40:00.739
- Good God! What are you doing?
- Get back!

40:39.109 --> 40:41.212
Why are you stopping?

40:43.848 --> 40:46.317
You said there was
still a chance.

40:46.350 --> 40:48.119
The blood transfusion!

40:48.953 --> 40:50.922
A small chance...

40:52.290 --> 40:54.192
But I fear,

40:54.225 --> 40:56.929
she needed more than
any of us could safely give.

40:56.962 --> 41:00.232
I'd give it! I'd give it all!

41:09.607 --> 41:11.643
You killed her.

41:14.279 --> 41:15.881
Art...

41:15.913 --> 41:17.682
And you...

41:17.716 --> 41:19.785
You failed her
from the beginning.

41:19.817 --> 41:22.219
And on purpose,
I shouldn't wonder!

41:22.252 --> 41:24.589
- What are you saying?
- You know perfectly well.

41:24.622 --> 41:26.724
If you're accusing me
of deliberate malpractice...

41:26.757 --> 41:28.593
If you couldn't have her,
why should anyone?

41:28.627 --> 41:29.895
I loved her as much as anyone!

41:32.062 --> 41:35.099
It's no secret why she
chose you, your Lordship!

41:35.132 --> 41:36.901
John, that's enough!

41:36.935 --> 41:38.870
Get out!

41:38.902 --> 41:41.205
Get out, both of you.

42:15.839 --> 42:18.843
How could I say
something like that?

42:19.944 --> 42:23.181
At a time like that?

42:27.819 --> 42:30.122
He's suffered so much.

42:44.435 --> 42:45.870
Still...

42:47.004 --> 42:49.240
at least it's over now.

42:51.408 --> 42:56.781
And we needn't worry Arthur
with the things in your book.

43:00.884 --> 43:02.787
I'm Lucy's doctor.

43:03.488 --> 43:05.390
I'll write
the death certificate.

43:07.158 --> 43:08.694
Anaemia.

43:09.960 --> 43:12.397
Weakness of the heart.

43:12.430 --> 43:14.933
No one will question it,

43:14.966 --> 43:16.402
and then...

43:18.002 --> 43:19.904
that'll be the end of it.

43:24.241 --> 43:28.180
I'm afraid it will
not be the end of it.

43:29.913 --> 43:31.350
Not at all.

43:32.951 --> 43:35.353
This business...

43:35.386 --> 43:37.989
and Arthur's suffering.

43:39.424 --> 43:41.393
It has only just begun.

43:43.794 --> 43:47.498
Do you deny what you saw
with your own eyes

43:47.531 --> 43:49.367
when we entered the chapel?

43:50.102 --> 43:52.270
You mean, the way
she went to kiss him?

43:52.303 --> 43:54.138
Kiss him?

43:54.172 --> 43:57.042
I was 25 years a married man.

43:57.075 --> 43:59.143
I know what a kiss looks like.

43:59.810 --> 44:02.914
She meant to drink
his blood, John.

44:25.102 --> 44:27.238
Is she really dead?

44:27.272 --> 44:29.074
Undoubtedly so.

44:32.042 --> 44:34.044
She looks...

44:34.078 --> 44:37.015
When alive, she looked
worse than death.

44:38.549 --> 44:42.187
Now in death...
she looks more than alive.

44:42.219 --> 44:43.355
Yes.

44:43.988 --> 44:45.190
That's it.

44:49.127 --> 44:53.332
Professor, are you familiar with
the text of "Romeo And Juliet"?

44:53.931 --> 44:58.236
You are thinking that perhaps
some drug has been administered?

44:58.268 --> 45:00.906
Mm?
Creating the illusion of death.

45:00.939 --> 45:04.475
- Such things are possible.
- But when and how?

45:05.410 --> 45:08.113
Who and why?

45:10.480 --> 45:12.517
You referenced Shakespeare.

45:12.549 --> 45:17.522
May I reference another great
Englishman, Thomas Moore?

45:18.989 --> 45:22.227
"A drowning man
will clutch at a straw."

45:24.161 --> 45:25.930
S-still...

45:25.964 --> 45:28.065
don't you think
we should at least

45:28.098 --> 45:29.901
continue to monitor
her condition?

45:29.933 --> 45:32.336
Yes, that we must do.

45:33.605 --> 45:35.273
You must persuade Arthur

45:35.306 --> 45:37.409
the body be laid out
here at the house

45:37.442 --> 45:40.245
until such time as
the funeral can be arranged.

45:40.277 --> 45:42.413
I don't think Arthur will
listen to anything I propose.

45:42.446 --> 45:46.017
In time, he will
come to his senses.

45:48.018 --> 45:49.921
I hope you're right.

46:26.390 --> 46:28.359
Thank you.

46:28.393 --> 46:31.161
My father's accountant
will settle the bill.

46:31.194 --> 46:32.530
Yes, sir.

46:59.056 --> 47:01.392
You have done well, John.

47:01.426 --> 47:04.997
Lucy will be much easier
to observe here at the house.

47:05.730 --> 47:07.332
Observe?

47:07.364 --> 47:09.533
You speak as though
she were still alive.

47:09.567 --> 47:11.136
Alive?

47:12.102 --> 47:13.137
No.

47:13.904 --> 47:16.408
She is not alive,
of that I am certain.

47:17.274 --> 47:19.343
But... dead?

47:21.044 --> 47:23.414
This we still need to confirm.

47:32.189 --> 47:34.292
Thank you both...

47:35.192 --> 47:37.127
for, um...

47:37.160 --> 47:39.196
for everything you've done.

47:41.598 --> 47:44.068
I may have said some...

47:44.102 --> 47:46.103
regrettable things.

47:46.136 --> 47:48.205
Unforgivable things, really.

47:49.707 --> 47:52.310
- That I...
- Arthur, sir.

47:52.343 --> 47:55.480
What a man does
in a rash moment...

47:56.314 --> 47:59.250
need not reflect
his true character.

48:00.118 --> 48:04.189
Now, we must indeed talk
further, but not of this.

48:05.189 --> 48:07.993
May I suggest the drawing room?

48:08.026 --> 48:11.228
Of course, um, the house is
at your disposal, Professor.

48:12.062 --> 48:16.133
Then Doctor Seward and I
may stay on a few days?

48:16.167 --> 48:19.971
Think nothing of it. I'll have
the maid prepare two more rooms.

48:22.372 --> 48:25.343
I'm actually rather
grateful for the company.

48:28.645 --> 48:31.482
Now that everything's
organised for the funeral

48:31.515 --> 48:34.351
and Lucy's acquaintances
have been informed,

48:34.384 --> 48:36.555
I feel rather adrift.

48:38.355 --> 48:44.062
Miss Lucy has left all of her
possessions to you, I believe.

48:44.094 --> 48:45.730
Yes, yes, so they tell me.

48:45.763 --> 48:49.134
But I haven't had a moment
to think about it really.

48:50.234 --> 48:53.471
I noticed some papers
in her room.

48:53.504 --> 48:57.442
Letters, journals,
this type of thing.

48:57.475 --> 49:01.413
Would you have any objection
to me examining them?

49:02.480 --> 49:07.552
The mystery of Lucy's
illness still troubles me.

49:07.585 --> 49:11.723
I think there may be much we can
learn from her own writings.

49:11.756 --> 49:14.158
You must do as you see fit.

49:14.192 --> 49:17.362
It's all academic
now though, I suppose.

49:18.428 --> 49:20.598
I wish that were so.

49:22.265 --> 49:25.202
But we may yet have
more work to do.

49:25.236 --> 49:27.439
Perhaps now is not the time,
Professor.

49:27.471 --> 49:29.506
No, no, no, no...

49:29.540 --> 49:31.709
Whatever you have to say,
I want to hear it.

49:31.741 --> 49:34.379
I know you were keeping things
from me when Lucy was alive,

49:34.411 --> 49:37.114
and though I appreciate
the sentiment,

49:37.147 --> 49:39.483
it's of no use now.

49:39.517 --> 49:41.719
The worst has already happened.

49:43.788 --> 49:46.190
I'm afraid not, Arthur.

49:47.457 --> 49:49.527
What?

49:51.294 --> 49:55.433
All will be revealed,
I believe, quite shortly.

49:56.834 --> 49:59.703
But, in the meantime,

49:59.736 --> 50:02.706
may I give you something?

50:02.739 --> 50:04.442
Both of you?

50:04.475 --> 50:08.680
It is most important
that you both wear

50:08.712 --> 50:14.185
one of these chains at
all times, even when you sleep.

50:14.218 --> 50:17.455
Especially when you sleep.

50:17.488 --> 50:21.359
I'm quite confident
in my beliefs, Professor.

50:21.392 --> 50:24.161
Things might be different
overseas but...

50:24.194 --> 50:27.765
the Church of England doesn't
encourage wearing such...

50:27.797 --> 50:29.334
tokens.

50:29.366 --> 50:33.403
Nevertheless, do me
this one favour...

50:33.437 --> 50:34.806
please?

50:39.743 --> 50:42.212
Why are we creeping
about at this hour?

50:42.245 --> 50:43.780
We have work to do

50:43.814 --> 50:46.584
which would be very troubling
for the young man.

50:46.616 --> 50:49.520
I knew it. You want to
carry out a post-mortem.

50:50.922 --> 50:52.324
No.

50:56.960 --> 51:00.165
I want to pierce her heart
and sever her head.

51:00.198 --> 51:03.401
- Have you gone mad?
- I warned you, John,

51:03.433 --> 51:05.469
that the worst
was still to come.

51:06.404 --> 51:08.473
Look, look here.

51:09.306 --> 51:10.674
See?

51:10.707 --> 51:13.377
See how they sever
the head of the beast?

51:13.410 --> 51:16.580
This is some barbaric
medieval ritual!

51:16.614 --> 51:19.151
After all that has happened,
you still doubt me?

51:20.018 --> 51:23.455
I don't doubt your wisdom,
Professor.

51:24.622 --> 51:26.424
But your methods...

51:30.962 --> 51:35.800
Then reserve your judgement
until we open the casket.

51:37.335 --> 51:39.371
What are you doing?

51:40.303 --> 51:42.439
It's been several days.

51:42.473 --> 51:44.776
John, if I am correct,

51:44.808 --> 51:47.312
we will find in this coffin

51:47.344 --> 51:50.881
a vision of Lucy
exactly as the day she died.

51:51.649 --> 51:55.687
Remember how you yourself doubted
the very fact of her death?

52:04.728 --> 52:06.230
My God!

52:07.698 --> 52:10.335
It's worse than I thought!

52:36.993 --> 52:38.997
What does this all mean?

52:39.029 --> 52:42.366
John, I had prepared
to show you...

52:43.334 --> 52:45.469
that Lucy is not dead,

52:46.671 --> 52:49.707
but that she is in fact undead.

52:50.707 --> 52:53.543
And to prove this by her pallor,

52:53.576 --> 52:56.647
her complexion being
that of one still living.

52:58.049 --> 53:00.919
But now I see we have
less time that I thought.

53:01.518 --> 53:04.555
Arthur must be told everything.

53:06.524 --> 53:11.563
And this must end tomorrow,
exactly as I described.

53:16.734 --> 53:19.603
- It's the maid!
- Someone's gone outside.

53:21.939 --> 53:25.042
Someone... or something.

53:40.123 --> 53:42.727
In all of my preparations,

53:42.759 --> 53:45.363
how could I have forgotten
the maid?

53:47.497 --> 53:49.700
That poor girl.

53:50.768 --> 53:52.770
The police have left.

53:52.803 --> 53:56.341
They seem to believe some sort of
animal had bitten her in the night.

53:56.373 --> 53:58.042
A rat or some such.

53:58.075 --> 54:00.645
Do you have rats in the house?

54:00.678 --> 54:01.946
Of course not.

54:01.978 --> 54:04.482
And you told the police this?

54:09.853 --> 54:11.955
Arthur...

54:11.989 --> 54:15.960
yesterday you said I should no
longer hide the truth from you.

54:15.993 --> 54:18.330
Well, quite right.

54:18.962 --> 54:21.131
Then I shall be plain.

54:21.165 --> 54:24.936
It was not an animal
that killed that girl.

54:26.002 --> 54:28.105
It was Miss Lucy.

54:29.105 --> 54:30.642
What?!

54:32.176 --> 54:34.078
What do you mean?

54:34.111 --> 54:38.650
Last night, Miss Lucy
was absent from her coffin.

54:39.482 --> 54:41.118
It's true, Art.

54:41.152 --> 54:44.055
We went to examine the body
last night and she was gone.

54:44.087 --> 54:46.457
You mean someone had taken her?

54:46.489 --> 54:48.558
I mean that last night,

54:48.591 --> 54:52.796
Miss Lucy got up from her coffin
and walked out of this house,

54:52.830 --> 54:55.767
and once outside
she killed the maid

54:55.799 --> 54:57.968
and drained her of blood.

54:58.002 --> 55:01.005
And the two of you
are convinced of this?

55:06.210 --> 55:11.516
Well... there's only one way
to prove it, isn't there?

55:18.756 --> 55:19.958
There.

55:20.857 --> 55:22.760
Are you satisfied?

55:23.560 --> 55:25.997
I swear, when we looked
last night she was gone.

55:26.830 --> 55:27.931
Professor?

55:32.169 --> 55:36.875
During the day,
the beast returns to its lair.

55:38.475 --> 55:40.611
How could you say such a thing?

55:41.145 --> 55:42.580
Arthur...

55:42.613 --> 55:45.683
you ask me to speak plainly,
so I do.

55:46.783 --> 55:48.185
Look!

55:48.218 --> 55:50.187
Look at her neck!

55:50.221 --> 55:53.825
The same bite marks as
you saw on the maid's neck.

55:53.857 --> 55:55.826
So the same thing that
killed Lucy killed the maid?

55:55.859 --> 55:58.595
Lucy killed the maid!

56:00.096 --> 56:02.065
And she will kill again.

56:02.098 --> 56:03.901
The only reason
the three of us

56:03.933 --> 56:06.703
did not meet the same fate
as the maid

56:06.736 --> 56:08.939
is these crucifixes.

56:08.973 --> 56:11.875
She must be stopped.

56:11.908 --> 56:15.779
Her heart must be pierced
and her head severed.

56:15.812 --> 56:18.248
And we must do it now,

56:18.281 --> 56:20.751
- while she sleeps!
- I can't!

56:23.721 --> 56:26.591
I can't believe it,
don't you see?

56:29.560 --> 56:31.563
Even if it were true...

56:33.531 --> 56:35.033
I can't.

56:36.634 --> 56:38.136
Not Lucy.

56:43.140 --> 56:44.776
I understand.

56:46.576 --> 56:48.879
What the mind can accept,

56:48.913 --> 56:51.983
sometimes the heart cannot.

56:53.683 --> 56:56.488
We must wait for absolute proof.

57:03.828 --> 57:07.864
As young Doctor Seward here
likes to remind me,

57:07.897 --> 57:12.636
we live in an age of
scientific knowledge,

57:12.669 --> 57:14.905
not of superstition.

57:15.906 --> 57:17.075
But...

57:17.875 --> 57:22.246
with so much new knowledge
entering the world,

57:22.279 --> 57:25.016
and fighting for our attention,

57:25.049 --> 57:28.052
there is a danger, I think,

57:28.085 --> 57:32.056
that we forget
the old knowledge we once had.

57:33.924 --> 57:37.594
There are, after all, certain
things we still take on faith,

57:37.627 --> 57:38.830
are there not?

57:40.230 --> 57:43.601
We still attend the church
each Sunday.

57:43.634 --> 57:49.240
We still ask for God's blessing
on a marriage or a birth.

57:49.272 --> 57:53.074
And we take it on faith
the he is listening.

57:53.243 --> 57:57.681
So is it not therefore possible,

57:57.714 --> 58:00.785
nay, probable,

58:00.817 --> 58:05.924
that there should also be
faith of a darker kind?

58:06.957 --> 58:09.192
Another side to the world

58:09.225 --> 58:12.596
which in daylight we never see,

58:12.629 --> 58:16.033
and yet exists all the same?

58:18.835 --> 58:21.305
People knew of it long ago.

58:26.210 --> 58:27.912
The undead.

58:28.712 --> 58:30.748
The vampire.

58:32.116 --> 58:35.018
This is what
we are dealing with.

58:36.986 --> 58:38.722
To be truthful,

58:38.756 --> 58:40.892
I suspected this
from the beginning.

58:42.292 --> 58:46.163
And yet it seemed
an idea so extraordinary

58:46.196 --> 58:49.801
that I dared not share it,
lest you think me insane.

58:51.335 --> 58:53.771
But at each turn,

58:53.803 --> 58:57.240
I became more and more
convinced that it was true.

58:59.442 --> 59:02.245
The vampiric curse,

59:02.279 --> 59:04.782
or... infection,

59:04.814 --> 59:08.284
if you wish to use
a scientific term,

59:08.317 --> 59:11.622
is transferred via the blood.

59:12.955 --> 59:15.792
As Lucy's own blood...

59:16.460 --> 59:18.963
was withdrawn,

59:18.995 --> 59:20.730
another blood,

59:20.763 --> 59:23.968
the vampire's blood,
replaced it.

59:25.169 --> 59:28.305
This blood so poisoned her,

59:28.337 --> 59:31.209
that not only could
she no longer go on living...

59:32.408 --> 59:35.012
but also that
she cannot truly die.

59:37.147 --> 59:39.984
And so she remains, undead.

59:40.984 --> 59:43.087
A vampire.

59:43.120 --> 59:46.190
Forced to feed on
the blood of the living

59:46.223 --> 59:49.860
as one such creature
formerly fed on her.

59:49.893 --> 59:53.965
Then, the maid - will
she also become a vampire?

59:54.797 --> 59:56.200
No, thank God.

59:56.232 --> 59:58.435
If a vampire feeds
without first injecting

59:58.468 --> 01:00:01.705
its own blood into its victim,

01:00:01.739 --> 01:00:03.374
the curse is not passed on.

01:00:03.406 --> 01:00:06.042
You mentioned the crucifixes,

01:00:06.076 --> 01:00:08.913
- that they protected us?
- Yes.

01:00:08.946 --> 01:00:11.449
According to the old knowledge,

01:00:11.482 --> 01:00:16.454
vampires are possessed
of certain weaknesses.

01:00:16.486 --> 01:00:19.255
The holy crucifix
they cannot touch.

01:00:19.288 --> 01:00:22.727
It burns them.
The same is true of holy water.

01:00:24.093 --> 01:00:26.496
Garlic, they cannot abide.

01:00:26.529 --> 01:00:28.865
This is the reason
for the garlic flowers

01:00:28.899 --> 01:00:31.035
spread beneath the window.

01:00:32.468 --> 01:00:36.173
Most powerful of all
is sunlight.

01:00:37.341 --> 01:00:40.978
The vampire's power
is much diminished

01:00:41.011 --> 01:00:43.413
during the hours of daylight.

01:00:43.446 --> 01:00:47.084
This is why they must return to
their resting place each morning.

01:00:48.218 --> 01:00:50.353
And finally...

01:00:50.386 --> 01:00:52.756
to kill them,

01:00:52.790 --> 01:00:56.826
is to pierce the heart
and sever the head.

01:00:56.859 --> 01:00:58.796
There is no other way.

01:01:01.098 --> 01:01:05.937
If... I see with my own eyes
what you have described,

01:01:09.839 --> 01:01:11.975
you have my blessing to act.

01:01:15.011 --> 01:01:17.448
Then we have a long night
ahead of us.

01:01:33.462 --> 01:01:35.832
Remember what I told you,
Arthur.

01:01:37.134 --> 01:01:38.502
If she wakes...

01:01:38.535 --> 01:01:40.404
Her heart must be pierced.

01:01:44.373 --> 01:01:48.379
It would be safer to do it now,
while she sleeps.

01:01:50.180 --> 01:01:51.815
I can't.

01:01:54.317 --> 01:01:56.187
I need to be sure.

01:01:57.587 --> 01:02:01.892
The papers I mentioned,
Lucy's letters and journal.

01:02:01.924 --> 01:02:03.960
May I view them now?

01:02:05.395 --> 01:02:07.431
Yes, of course, erm...

01:02:07.464 --> 01:02:10.034
Everything is still
as it was in...

01:02:12.335 --> 01:02:13.937
in the bedroom.

01:02:15.305 --> 01:02:19.210
I will be back shortly.
Remember what I said.

01:03:01.350 --> 01:03:05.323
"From the pen of
Miss Mina Murray."

01:03:41.091 --> 01:03:42.426
No!

01:03:55.404 --> 01:03:57.140
What happened?

01:03:57.707 --> 01:03:59.943
I don't remember, I...

01:03:59.977 --> 01:04:01.946
- I think I hit my head.
- Wait here.

01:04:10.520 --> 01:04:12.156
Lucy!

01:04:44.286 --> 01:04:47.591
So, you have finally
seen the proof?

01:04:48.625 --> 01:04:50.160
I don't know.

01:04:50.192 --> 01:04:52.462
The coffin is empty!

01:04:52.495 --> 01:04:55.498
- Do you accept that?
- Yes.

01:04:55.531 --> 01:04:58.301
And nobody else
was in the room but you?

01:04:59.102 --> 01:05:00.571
Yes.

01:05:00.603 --> 01:05:03.373
So you accept that neither
Doctor Seward nor I

01:05:03.406 --> 01:05:05.408
- could have removed the body?
- Yes!

01:05:05.442 --> 01:05:08.179
He's had quite a shock,
Professor.

01:05:11.314 --> 01:05:12.582
Yes.

01:05:13.750 --> 01:05:17.221
Perhaps a brandy
would be in order.

01:05:25.294 --> 01:05:28.297
Drink up, Art.
It'll steady your nerves.

01:05:28.330 --> 01:05:32.202
Yes, the night is far from over.

01:05:33.502 --> 01:05:35.805
When Lucy returns

01:05:35.839 --> 01:05:38.241
- we will need to make...
- No!

01:05:41.310 --> 01:05:44.547
I've failed you both tonight,
I can see that.

01:05:46.415 --> 01:05:49.085
I'd like you to give
me another chance.

01:05:50.453 --> 01:05:52.589
Another chance to do what?

01:05:52.622 --> 01:05:54.625
Take care of this.

01:05:57.259 --> 01:05:59.229
It's my responsibility.

01:05:59.897 --> 01:06:04.602
- What are you talking about?
- To deal with Lucy. She's...

01:06:06.203 --> 01:06:08.773
She was my fiancée after all.

01:06:10.841 --> 01:06:13.444
This is something
I need to do myself.

01:06:15.377 --> 01:06:18.281
I've relied on
the two of you too much.

01:06:19.248 --> 01:06:21.417
But I'm stronger now.

01:06:21.451 --> 01:06:24.154
I know what needs to be done.

01:06:24.187 --> 01:06:26.357
And I'm ready to do it.

01:06:31.761 --> 01:06:33.163
I understand.

01:06:33.797 --> 01:06:35.199
What?

01:06:35.765 --> 01:06:40.403
Arthur knows as much as you
or I do on the subject now.

01:06:40.437 --> 01:06:45.342
It is entirely his right
to do what must be done,

01:06:45.375 --> 01:06:47.277
on his own terms.

01:06:47.944 --> 01:06:50.480
I knew you'd understand,
Professor.

01:06:52.281 --> 01:06:55.318
What on earth was all that
about? On his own terms?

01:06:56.085 --> 01:06:59.122
Do you really think Arthur's
capable of dealing with Lucy?

01:06:59.156 --> 01:07:01.225
Something is wrong

01:07:01.257 --> 01:07:04.227
and it would have done no good
to argue with Arthur.

01:07:04.261 --> 01:07:07.531
He clearly has a reason for
this sudden change of heart.

01:07:08.265 --> 01:07:11.502
We will find out soon enough,
tomorrow night.

01:07:57.379 --> 01:07:58.481
Look at this.

01:07:59.616 --> 01:08:01.752
- "Murderer at large."
- Read on.

01:08:02.618 --> 01:08:06.856
"The spectre of Jack The Ripper
was raised again last night,

01:08:06.890 --> 01:08:09.459
after the discovery
of the body of a woman

01:08:09.491 --> 01:08:11.761
in London's
Whitechapel district."

01:08:11.794 --> 01:08:14.797
Look there! The victim
was drained of her blood.

01:08:16.933 --> 01:08:19.736
The beast must
quench its thirst.

01:08:19.769 --> 01:08:22.206
And Arthur has done absolutely
nothing to stop it!

01:08:24.741 --> 01:08:26.676
Have you rung the bell?

01:08:26.710 --> 01:08:27.912
I have.

01:08:28.578 --> 01:08:31.479
Well, we can't just stand
around here all day.

01:08:31.514 --> 01:08:33.550
There must be another way in.

01:08:33.582 --> 01:08:35.451
I suspect young Arthur

01:08:35.484 --> 01:08:38.354
will have been careful
to make sure there is not.

01:08:38.388 --> 01:08:40.991
- Then what do we do?
- We return again,

01:08:41.023 --> 01:08:43.426
tonight, unannounced.

01:08:44.327 --> 01:08:48.532
Until then, do you know the
location of the nearest church?

01:11:19.616 --> 01:11:21.685
Do you have the bottle
I gave you?

01:11:22.652 --> 01:11:24.922
Yes. But how do we get inside?

01:11:26.156 --> 01:11:30.394
These were clutched in the hand
of the maid when we found her.

01:11:30.426 --> 01:11:32.862
This afternoon I made
enquiries with the police

01:11:32.895 --> 01:11:34.764
and I was able to retrieve them.

01:11:34.797 --> 01:11:39.370
- Which one is it?
- That... I do not know.

01:11:54.082 --> 01:11:55.852
I, er...

01:11:55.885 --> 01:11:58.989
I know you have to feed, Lucy.

01:11:59.022 --> 01:12:01.591
I... I... I brought her
here for you.

01:12:03.593 --> 01:12:05.429
Is she still warm?

01:12:06.496 --> 01:12:10.667
Yes, oh, yes, she's...
Will.. will she be enough?

01:12:11.835 --> 01:12:14.438
It's never enough, Arthur.

01:12:19.509 --> 01:12:23.080
Don't you miss the touch
of these hands, Arthur?

01:12:24.179 --> 01:12:26.582
The touch of these lips?

01:12:27.783 --> 01:12:30.953
Ah, you're cold. Like ice.

01:12:31.520 --> 01:12:35.959
I need you to fill me up
with your warmth, Arthur.

01:12:37.794 --> 01:12:39.796
But first...

01:12:45.902 --> 01:12:48.005
Join me, Arthur.

01:12:51.573 --> 01:12:53.643
Drink with me.

01:12:53.675 --> 01:12:57.112
Then we can be together forever.

01:12:57.145 --> 01:12:59.916
Lucy, I just wanted
to help, I...

01:13:00.817 --> 01:13:04.488
I thought if, if you had
enough blood you might be cured.

01:13:04.520 --> 01:13:08.524
You don't want to cure me,
you want to join me!

01:13:10.626 --> 01:13:14.897
I know you feel the hunger
that I feel, Arthur.

01:13:15.831 --> 01:13:18.035
I shared my blood with you.

01:13:21.571 --> 01:13:24.575
Soon, we'll share everything.

01:13:39.956 --> 01:13:41.757
Join me!

01:13:44.227 --> 01:13:45.996
Arthur, no!

01:13:48.931 --> 01:13:51.902
John! The water!

01:13:52.969 --> 01:13:55.706
This is holy water.

01:13:56.839 --> 01:13:59.542
I know you fear its touch.

01:14:28.971 --> 01:14:32.009
Arthur, we cannot
hold her much longer!

01:14:35.345 --> 01:14:36.914
Quickly, Art!

01:14:37.447 --> 01:14:39.683
You can't defeat us!

01:14:39.715 --> 01:14:42.285
My master will
return for us all!

01:14:42.318 --> 01:14:44.187
Do it!

01:14:47.991 --> 01:14:49.026
Now!

01:15:09.178 --> 01:15:13.082
Finally, she is at peace.

01:15:26.328 --> 01:15:28.864
I know what he's doing in there.

01:15:31.099 --> 01:15:34.136
There's no need
to pretend otherwise.

01:15:37.040 --> 01:15:39.009
She won't suffer, Art.

01:15:40.843 --> 01:15:42.011
Not anymore.

01:15:51.319 --> 01:15:53.389
Dear God, what have I done?

01:16:34.162 --> 01:16:36.366
You know it wasn't Lucy.

01:16:38.968 --> 01:16:41.738
That... thing.

01:16:47.175 --> 01:16:49.845
It could pretend to be her.

01:16:49.879 --> 01:16:51.915
It had her form.

01:16:51.947 --> 01:16:53.916
But it wasn't her.

01:17:20.143 --> 01:17:22.078
I knew it deep down.

01:17:25.180 --> 01:17:30.319
Even as I convinced myself
that I could still save her.

01:17:34.956 --> 01:17:37.460
A feeling I've always felt,
really.

01:17:40.229 --> 01:17:42.932
That there was...

01:17:42.965 --> 01:17:44.901
a part of her...

01:17:46.035 --> 01:17:48.037
that I didn't know.

01:17:51.506 --> 01:17:53.743
That never belonged to me.

01:17:56.379 --> 01:17:58.482
That belonged to someone else.

01:18:00.148 --> 01:18:02.484
- Art...
- Let's...

01:18:02.518 --> 01:18:06.790
just drink
to the good memories

01:18:06.822 --> 01:18:08.959
we both have.

01:18:26.474 --> 01:18:29.478
<i>Per istam sanctam unctionem</i>

01:18:29.511 --> 01:18:33.849
<i>et suam piissimam
misericordiam adiuvet.</i>

01:18:34.483 --> 01:18:37.887
<i>Tem dominus gratia
spiritus sancti,</i>

01:18:37.920 --> 01:18:41.024
<i>ut a peccatis liberatum</i>

01:18:41.823 --> 01:18:45.060
<i>te salvet atque
propitious alleviet.</i>

01:18:54.636 --> 01:18:56.907
Through this holy anointing

01:18:58.040 --> 01:19:01.010
and through His most holy mercy,

01:19:01.042 --> 01:19:03.313
may the Lord help you,

01:19:03.345 --> 01:19:05.348
by the grace of the Holy Spirit,

01:19:06.381 --> 01:19:08.483
that He may free you

01:19:08.517 --> 01:19:10.854
and save you from your sins,

01:19:11.586 --> 01:19:13.589
and by His favour,

01:19:13.622 --> 01:19:15.591
grant you relief

01:19:15.625 --> 01:19:18.060
and raise you up to heaven.

01:19:40.116 --> 01:19:42.484
Are you sure you can't stay
a little longer, Professor?

01:19:42.518 --> 01:19:45.355
Art will be sorry he missed you.
I could wake him?

01:19:46.087 --> 01:19:47.956
Let him sleep, John.

01:19:47.989 --> 01:19:50.926
He has not rested properly
for days,

01:19:50.960 --> 01:19:54.063
and I have much to do
in my study.

01:19:54.095 --> 01:19:58.433
Miss Lucy's letters and
journal are most interesting,

01:19:58.466 --> 01:20:00.002
I must study them further.

01:20:06.675 --> 01:20:08.978
It sounds like
your carriage is here.

01:20:24.292 --> 01:20:26.696
- Professor Van Helsing?
- Yes?

01:20:26.729 --> 01:20:28.598
I knew it was you.

01:20:28.630 --> 01:20:31.433
Lucy described you so well
in her last letter.

01:20:31.466 --> 01:20:34.103
I... I'm sorry, miss,
but I'm afraid I...

01:20:34.135 --> 01:20:35.971
I have something for you.

01:20:36.005 --> 01:20:38.675
I believe these diaries will
provide crucial information

01:20:38.707 --> 01:20:40.509
for you in your investigations.

01:20:40.542 --> 01:20:44.013
Ah, yes! I remember
your letter to Lucy.

01:20:44.045 --> 01:20:47.049
Miss Mina Murray, I presume?

01:20:47.082 --> 01:20:51.053
Actually, my fiancé and I were
recently married in Budapest.

01:20:52.087 --> 01:20:54.925
It's Harker, Mina Harker.
