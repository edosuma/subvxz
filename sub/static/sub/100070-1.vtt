01:11.080 --> 01:12.670
Doc?
What's happened?

01:12.720 --> 01:14.310
Mum's stuck.

01:14.360 --> 01:16.000
What's she doing up in the air
like that?

01:16.030 --> 01:19.030
That's what I said. Get me down!
I thought, if I lifted up the crush,

01:19.080 --> 01:20.080
it'd help her get free,

01:20.120 --> 01:22.760
but her leg just sort
of fell through the floor.

01:22.790 --> 01:25.120
I can't check her till you cut
her out of that contraption.

01:25.150 --> 01:27.310
Pete,
I am not cutting her out till...

01:27.360 --> 01:28.870
THEY ARGUE
Shut up!

01:28.920 --> 01:31.280
Can you move your toes?
Yeah.

01:31.310 --> 01:32.360
And turn your ankle?

01:33.840 --> 01:35.200
Yeah.
OK, no bones broken,

01:35.230 --> 01:37.150
just minor lacerations.
You can cut her out.

01:37.200 --> 01:38.590
OK, come on.
Give me that ladder.

01:41.030 --> 01:43.200
Cut it right there.
What's your name?

01:43.230 --> 01:44.560
Gerry.
Stand on there.

01:44.590 --> 01:48.030
Steady, careful. Mind the leg.

01:48.080 --> 01:49.870
I don't like heights, Doc,

01:49.920 --> 01:51.640
and I'm in a lot
of bloody pain here.

01:51.670 --> 01:54.870
Got any difficulty breathing?
I have a bit, it hurts a bit, yeah.

01:54.920 --> 01:56.230
Where exactly does it hurt?

01:56.280 --> 01:59.480
Kind of everywhere.
Bloody cow slammed into me.

01:59.510 --> 02:01.080
Your pulse is racing.

02:02.200 --> 02:04.950
OK, Doc, our lady's free.
All right.

02:05.000 --> 02:07.480
Bring her down very slowly
and very carefully.

02:07.510 --> 02:09.669
Yeah, thanks, Doc,
we know what we're doing.

02:09.710 --> 02:10.949
Oh, right.

02:10.990 --> 02:12.080
OK, bring her down.

02:13.760 --> 02:17.480
I didn't know she was in the crush.
So I sent a cow down the channel.

02:17.510 --> 02:20.040
The cow panicked when it saw Mum
and started rearing back in.

02:20.080 --> 02:22.550
It must've knocked the mechanism,
so when Mum tried to get out,

02:22.600 --> 02:25.440
the gates just closed on her.
Yeah, I didn't get a word of that.

02:25.480 --> 02:26.710
Shall we bring in the jaws?

02:33.600 --> 02:34.990
Oh, Mum, I'm sorry.

02:37.320 --> 02:39.440
Oh, careful, careful.

02:39.480 --> 02:42.160
Can you feel your toes, Mrs...?
What's her name?

02:42.200 --> 02:45.390
Lamorna. Yeah, I can.
All right, lift your arms.

02:45.440 --> 02:46.760
SHE GROANS

02:46.790 --> 02:48.990
Doc, you seem to have this,

02:49.040 --> 02:50.950
we've had a shout about a TA
in Pendoggett.

02:50.990 --> 02:52.950
Yes, all right, go.

02:52.990 --> 02:55.160
Does this hurt?
Ow. Yes.

02:55.200 --> 02:58.110
All right. Put your arms down.
I can't feel any broken ribs.

02:58.160 --> 03:01.230
I want you to come to my surgery
today so I can examine you further.

03:01.270 --> 03:03.080
It'll have to be this afternoon.
Right.

03:03.110 --> 03:05.550
The cow didn't mean it, Mum.
No, it's not the cow's fault.

03:05.600 --> 03:08.360
It's YOU, you idiot.
I told you over and over,

03:08.390 --> 03:10.320
"Always check
before you send one down."

03:10.360 --> 03:12.270
All right, stop talking,
try and stay still.

03:12.320 --> 03:13.950
And come to the surgery
this afternoon.

03:13.990 --> 03:15.790
I appreciate you coming, Doc.

03:15.830 --> 03:17.600
I know a lot of folks
think you're a tosser,

03:17.640 --> 03:19.270
but I'll be sorry to see you go.

03:19.320 --> 03:21.230
What do you mean?
I'm not going anywhere.

03:21.270 --> 03:23.990
Well, they're getting rid of you,
aren't they?  No, they're not.

03:24.040 --> 03:26.200
Pretty sure I heard the same thing.
Yeah.

03:26.230 --> 03:29.080
No, you heard wrong.
Make sure you come to the surgery.

03:31.510 --> 03:34.200
Come on, Mum.
No, thank you, I'm fine.

03:34.230 --> 03:36.600
TEACHER: Keep going.
That's it, keep going.

03:36.640 --> 03:38.550
Arms up in the air, wiggling around.

03:38.600 --> 03:39.600
OK, guys...

03:40.950 --> 03:43.200
Keep moving your body,
moving your hips...

03:43.230 --> 03:44.480
Daddy!

03:44.510 --> 03:46.760
Sorry I'm late, I had an emergency.

03:46.790 --> 03:49.760
Yeah, Morwenna said.
We're only a few minutes late.

03:49.790 --> 03:51.920
Keep moving your body...

03:54.320 --> 03:55.360
I have to admit,

03:55.390 --> 03:57.920
it's a little strange
being back here so soon.

03:57.950 --> 04:00.110
Why is that?
Oh, I don't know, Martin,

04:00.160 --> 04:02.510
maybe because I spent my entire
adult life working here,

04:02.550 --> 04:04.950
now I'm not.
Right, yes, course.

04:04.990 --> 04:07.790
Good idea of Mel's
to move the nursery here, though.

04:07.830 --> 04:08.920
Well, we'll see.

04:16.240 --> 04:17.440
Louisa!

04:17.470 --> 04:20.510
And Master James Henry. Shoes!

04:20.560 --> 04:21.910
What?
I've just refurbished,

04:21.950 --> 04:24.390
and I'd rather you didn't
traipse mud all through the place.

04:25.800 --> 04:28.270
Just wouldn't want anyone
to accuse me of not being stringent

04:28.320 --> 04:30.000
about health and safety.

04:30.030 --> 04:34.710
Oh, James, are you going
to give Mummy a... a kiss? James?

04:34.760 --> 04:37.560
Oh, well.
He seems to like it already.

04:37.590 --> 04:38.710
So he should.

04:38.760 --> 04:43.080
We've got a new art station,
soft play area up the back,

04:43.120 --> 04:45.440
little library over to your left.

04:45.470 --> 04:48.320
I don't know why I didn't think
about expanding before.

04:48.350 --> 04:50.000
People are always having children.

04:50.030 --> 04:52.200
Well, you two must be gearing up
for the next one.

04:54.470 --> 04:57.800
No, well, we're... we've got
our hands full with James and...

04:57.830 --> 05:00.830
Well, the clock's
well and truly ticking, though.

05:01.830 --> 05:04.030
It'd be nice for James to have
a little brother or sister

05:04.080 --> 05:06.240
to boss around.
It's none of your business.

05:06.270 --> 05:08.440
Actually,
it's literally my business.

05:08.470 --> 05:09.830
If you know what I mean.

05:09.880 --> 05:14.080
Right, then... let me show you
through the rest of the facilities.

05:26.910 --> 05:29.760
SHE SIGHS
Sorry, you can't park here.

05:29.800 --> 05:30.950
There's no line.

05:31.000 --> 05:34.830
There is a sign...
Well, there's a sign... holder.

05:34.880 --> 05:37.270
Someone's obviously stolen the sign.
Oh.

05:37.320 --> 05:40.910
You'd better tell the police.
Ye... Well, I am the police.

05:40.950 --> 05:44.000
Then, you're already on the case.
Very sharp.

05:45.150 --> 05:46.320
I do my best.

05:46.350 --> 05:48.510
Dr Ellingham's surgery,
just up the hill?

05:48.560 --> 05:50.710
Oh, yeah, just straight ahead,
you can't miss it.

05:50.760 --> 05:52.680
Thank you.
No, thank YOU.

05:54.440 --> 05:55.830
Maybe I'll see you around?

05:58.200 --> 05:59.240
Maybe.

06:06.320 --> 06:07.350
Take a seat.

06:11.350 --> 06:12.680
I'm here to see Dr Ellingham.

06:12.710 --> 06:15.320
Oh, do you have an appointment?
No.

06:15.350 --> 06:17.270
Technically,
I'm actually first in the queue.

06:17.320 --> 06:19.030
That's fine.
I'll make an appointment...

06:19.080 --> 06:20.390
I don't want an appointment.

06:20.440 --> 06:23.440
If it means that much, go before me.
You've misunderstood.

06:23.470 --> 06:26.150
There's still a place for chivalry
in the world.

06:26.200 --> 06:28.760
How was Mrs Hammond?
She got caught in a cattle crush.

06:28.800 --> 06:29.830
Who's my first patient?

06:29.880 --> 06:30.950
Donald Abbott.

06:31.000 --> 06:32.880
Dr Ellingham?
Are you Donald Abbott?

06:32.910 --> 06:35.680
No.  Do you have an appointment?
She doesn't. I'm Donald Abbott.

06:35.710 --> 06:37.150
I don't mind
if she goes before me...

06:37.200 --> 06:38.390
Be quiet. Go through.

06:38.440 --> 06:40.030
Did you just tell a patient
to be quiet?

06:40.080 --> 06:42.240
Yes. Make an appointment.
That's the receptionist.

06:42.270 --> 06:43.680
She doesn't want one, Doc.

06:43.710 --> 06:46.270
I'm not here for a consultation.

06:46.320 --> 06:49.030
I am Dr Rebecca Hedden from the GMC.

06:50.760 --> 06:52.510
We weren't expecting you
till Thursday.

06:52.560 --> 06:54.000
I like to keep to my own schedule.

06:54.030 --> 06:56.240
Well, my schedule's busy,
I've lots of patients to see.

06:56.270 --> 06:58.000
And I am here
to monitor the practice,

06:58.030 --> 07:01.120
which includes shadowing you
and your interaction with patients.

07:02.120 --> 07:04.390
No.
It's not a request, Dr Ellingham.

07:04.440 --> 07:07.560
It's a non-negotiable requirement
of the GMC

07:07.590 --> 07:10.590
following your tribunal hearing,
so, please, lead the way.

07:13.120 --> 07:15.080
DOG BARKS

07:20.640 --> 07:21.880
What seems to be the problem?

07:21.910 --> 07:23.080
Um...

07:24.240 --> 07:25.880
Oh, don't mind me,
I'm just observing.

07:25.910 --> 07:27.440
Oh, right, observe away.

07:27.470 --> 07:29.760
It's not going to be very exciting,
I'm afraid.

07:29.800 --> 07:32.350
Um, I've been feeling a bit dizzy,
Doctor,

07:32.390 --> 07:35.120
I've toppled over a couple of times.
Very inconvenient.

07:35.150 --> 07:37.080
Have you had any other illnesses
or symptoms

07:37.120 --> 07:38.590
in the last two or three months?

07:38.640 --> 07:40.760
Er, I had flu about a month ago.

07:41.880 --> 07:42.910
Follow my finger.

07:45.350 --> 07:46.910
What's this for?
Shush.

07:46.950 --> 07:49.800
Keep your head still, just the eyes.
If a patient has questions,

07:49.830 --> 07:51.830
it's good to reassure
and educate them.

07:53.800 --> 07:56.710
It's a technique used to detect
unilateral hyper function

07:56.760 --> 08:00.560
of the peripheral vestibular system.
Ah, I thought as much (!)

08:00.590 --> 08:02.950
He's measuring how you respond
to movement.

08:03.000 --> 08:05.910
Oh. Are you a doctor as well?
I am, yes.

08:05.950 --> 08:08.590
Are you Dr Ellingham's replacement,
then?

08:09.760 --> 08:11.080
I'm just here to observe.

08:11.120 --> 08:13.950
You have vestibular neuritis.

08:14.000 --> 08:16.470
The flu you had has left
an inflammation of the nerve

08:16.510 --> 08:17.800
in your inner ear.

08:17.830 --> 08:20.000
That's what's causing
your imbalance and nausea.

08:20.030 --> 08:23.120
I'll write you a prescription
for a course of Cinnarizine.

08:23.150 --> 08:25.350
Will I be able
to go about my daily life?

08:25.390 --> 08:28.150
I have a few things planned
for the next few days.

08:28.200 --> 08:30.830
Yes. It's a mild infection,
the medication should start working

08:30.880 --> 08:32.030
as soon you start taking it.

08:32.080 --> 08:34.230
Provided you get enough rest,
drink enough fluids,

08:34.280 --> 08:36.200
you should be fine.
If you have any more symptoms,

08:36.230 --> 08:39.039
make a follow up appointment.
Next patient!

08:43.230 --> 08:46.080
What was it we agreed on again?
100 quid, wasn't it?

08:46.110 --> 08:49.230
LAUGHING: No, it were 40.
Right. Yeah.

08:49.280 --> 08:51.750
Look, if you're gonna try
and rip me off, Gus,

08:51.800 --> 08:53.560
you could at least put some effort
into it.

08:53.590 --> 08:56.230
You're barely trying there.
You a bit skint at the moment?

08:57.870 --> 09:00.560
A boat like this,
the upkeep alone's killing me.

09:00.590 --> 09:01.800
Well, sell her.

09:01.830 --> 09:04.520
I've just had her fixed up.
What else am I gonna do?

09:05.590 --> 09:07.750
I just need a break, get even again.

09:09.750 --> 09:13.110
Well, you never know,
this might be your lucky day.

09:18.200 --> 09:21.080
It's incredibly irritating
having her hovering on my shoulder,

09:21.110 --> 09:23.280
watching my every move.
It's only for a day or two.

09:23.320 --> 09:25.710
No, it's for a week or more.

09:25.750 --> 09:27.320
You need to make an effort with her.

09:27.350 --> 09:29.870
Well, I'm allowing her to observe,
nothing more.

09:29.920 --> 09:32.350
Well, let's just try
and have a nice lunch anyway.

09:32.400 --> 09:33.920
Yes.
Come on.

09:34.920 --> 09:37.280
I was thinking,
maybe we could have a talk.

09:37.320 --> 09:39.990
What about?
About our situation.

09:40.040 --> 09:41.040
What situation?

09:42.160 --> 09:43.440
About what Mel said.

09:48.160 --> 09:51.400
Oh. Hello.
Um, we've not been introduced,

09:51.440 --> 09:52.560
I'm Louisa Ellingham.

09:52.590 --> 09:55.230
Dr Rebecca Hedden.
I was just looking to see

09:55.280 --> 09:57.800
where's recommended around here
for lunch. Any tips?

09:58.990 --> 10:01.590
Well, we were just heading
to a place on the plat

10:01.630 --> 10:03.520
that does a pretty good line
in fresh fish.

10:03.560 --> 10:06.920
Gets pretty booked up at lunchtime.
Luckily, we've booked a table.

10:08.080 --> 10:10.950
Would you like to join us?
You've probably got other plans.

10:10.990 --> 10:12.830
No, that'll be good. Thank you.

10:12.870 --> 10:16.920
Great. That's great. Come on. Erm...

10:33.040 --> 10:34.440
Hi!
Ah, great,

10:34.470 --> 10:35.710
we need two barrels changed

10:35.750 --> 10:37.470
and we're getting low
on pint glasses.

10:37.520 --> 10:38.560
Oh, hello to you, too (!)

10:38.590 --> 10:40.470
Sorry, love,
I'm just rushed off my feet.

10:40.520 --> 10:41.950
I promise it's just for a few days

10:41.990 --> 10:43.830
until I find someone else
to fill in.

10:43.870 --> 10:46.040
Maybe you shouldn't keep firing
the staff.

10:46.080 --> 10:48.400
I caught the last one taking money
out of the till.

10:48.440 --> 10:51.040
She's lucky
I didn't call Penhale on her.

10:51.080 --> 10:53.400
Apparently it's fine for your dad
to do it, though.

10:53.440 --> 10:55.280
Ah, Dad. Come on.

10:55.320 --> 10:56.320
Oh.

10:56.350 --> 10:59.400
Good news, you know that fisherman,
Gus? He's a fisherman.

10:59.440 --> 11:00.470
Yes, I gathered that.

11:00.520 --> 11:02.990
Anyway, he's struggling
with the cost of running his boat,

11:03.040 --> 11:05.200
and I said that we'd buy in
as partners

11:05.230 --> 11:06.520
at a very reasonable price.

11:06.560 --> 11:08.200
We're not buying into some boat,
Dad, OK?

11:08.230 --> 11:10.470
We get discounts on all the fish
that come in.

11:10.520 --> 11:12.470
Look,
we've only just paid Ruth back, OK?

11:12.520 --> 11:13.520
We can't afford this.

11:13.560 --> 11:16.200
It's a great opportunity.
What do YOU think?

11:16.230 --> 11:18.400
Er, it doesn't matter
what she thinks.

11:18.440 --> 11:19.560
Oh, lovely (!)

11:19.590 --> 11:21.160
I give up my lunch break
to help out,

11:21.200 --> 11:23.520
and that's all the thanks I get.
No, Morwenna, I didn't...

11:23.560 --> 11:25.870
Morwenna, I didn't mean it, I ju...
Look...

11:25.920 --> 11:28.400
Ruth only agreed to be the guarantor
for the pub

11:28.440 --> 11:30.590
if I was in charge
of the business decisions, yeah?

11:30.630 --> 11:33.560
And my business decision is no boat.
So give that to me.

11:36.950 --> 11:40.750
The GMC are keen for
a standardised quality of practice,

11:40.800 --> 11:42.470
and good partnership
with the patients

11:42.520 --> 11:43.990
is a keystone of that.
Why?

11:45.080 --> 11:47.470
Because we respect
the patients' right

11:47.520 --> 11:49.110
to reach decisions about their care

11:49.160 --> 11:51.520
in conjunction with the doctor.
It's a terrible idea.

11:51.560 --> 11:53.830
In my experience,
patients make appalling decisions.

11:55.710 --> 11:56.990
Louisa, you're a teacher,

11:57.040 --> 11:59.520
surely you must see the benefit
of consultation.

11:59.560 --> 12:02.520
Well, actually, I WAS,
but now I'm training as a counsellor

12:02.560 --> 12:04.870
to work with children.
Even more so, then.

12:04.920 --> 12:07.400
Don't you think,
the more informed a patient is,

12:07.440 --> 12:09.590
the better they'll respond
to the treatment plan?

12:09.630 --> 12:11.560
And surely, the sooner
we start that, the better.

12:11.590 --> 12:13.280
I'm sorry, Rebecca...

12:13.320 --> 12:15.590
Martin and I,
we sort of have a rule,

12:15.630 --> 12:18.440
no shoptalk at the table.
Do we?

12:18.470 --> 12:20.950
A patient made to feel uncomfortable
is more likely

12:20.990 --> 12:22.710
to withhold pertinent information.

12:22.750 --> 12:24.990
If a patient is lying to the doctor,

12:25.040 --> 12:27.200
then he doesn't really
deserve treatment, does he?

12:27.230 --> 12:29.470
I'm sorry,
but that's quite inflammatory.

12:29.520 --> 12:32.200
Oh, look, there's Ruth.
Ruth, Ruth, over here.

12:32.230 --> 12:34.200
Hello.
Come join us.

12:34.230 --> 12:35.320
I'll get you a chair.

12:35.350 --> 12:36.590
Afternoon, Ruth.

12:36.630 --> 12:38.560
Martin!

12:38.590 --> 12:40.800
Sorry. The more the merrier.

12:40.830 --> 12:43.950
Ruth, this is Dr Rebecca Hedden,
she's with the GMC.

12:43.990 --> 12:47.280
Oh, I see.
Hello, I'm Dr Ruth Ellingham.

12:47.320 --> 12:50.350
Oh, yes.
Chris Parsons mentioned you.

12:50.400 --> 12:53.230
We were just discussing
how the attitudes

12:53.280 --> 12:55.630
of medical practitioners
can affect patient care.

12:55.680 --> 12:57.320
Opinion, not fact.

12:57.350 --> 12:59.470
One based on numerous studies.

12:59.520 --> 13:01.440
Based on flawed methodology.

13:14.590 --> 13:16.950
Sally? You all right?

13:16.990 --> 13:20.400
Yes. Just... doing a little dusting.

13:20.440 --> 13:22.200
Perfectly normal behaviour.

13:23.230 --> 13:26.800
I have a prescription.
Oh. Right.

13:30.400 --> 13:32.400
So, how you getting on
with this month's book?

13:32.440 --> 13:35.160
The Virginia Woolf.
Oh, yes, erm...

13:35.200 --> 13:39.400
To A Lighthouse.
Oh, it's a marvellous book.

13:40.320 --> 13:42.990
You know, she based the lighthouse
on the one at Godrevy.

13:43.040 --> 13:45.440
Yes, I've always meant
to go and have a look.

13:45.470 --> 13:48.710
Especially after reading...
such a marvellous book.

13:48.750 --> 13:50.560
How about tomorrow?

13:52.440 --> 13:54.440
Tomorrow?
The lighthouse.

13:54.470 --> 13:57.160
A friend of mine's
been doing maintenance over there,

13:57.200 --> 13:59.080
he'd be more than happy
to lend me the keys.

13:59.110 --> 14:01.230
Is this some sort of...

14:02.520 --> 14:04.680
..date?
Is that a problem?

14:07.280 --> 14:10.870
No. No, not a problem at all.

14:11.870 --> 14:13.870
Right, then... see you tomorrow.

14:17.870 --> 14:19.680
Bye.
DOOR SHUTS

14:19.710 --> 14:21.520
Mm...

14:21.560 --> 14:24.920
It's undeniable that being inclusive
with patients

14:24.950 --> 14:27.200
can aid the medical process.
Just because you say

14:27.230 --> 14:29.400
something is undeniable,
doesn't make it a fact.

14:29.440 --> 14:31.590
I think that each doctor
has their own method

14:31.630 --> 14:33.590
of patient care
which works for them.

14:33.630 --> 14:36.590
And what works for a doctor
may not work for a patient.

14:36.630 --> 14:38.470
But I think Martin has a point.

14:38.520 --> 14:42.560
I mean, if he were at fault,
I would say so. And frequently, too.

14:42.590 --> 14:45.400
You frequently think he's at fault?
No, I didn't say that.

14:45.440 --> 14:47.110
Sorry, can I just interrupt?

14:47.160 --> 14:49.040
Look, is Martin gonna lose his job
or not?

14:49.080 --> 14:51.470
Oh, right. Well, that's what
all this is about, isn't it?

14:51.520 --> 14:54.680
I think we should just be honest,
really. Cards on the table.

15:00.440 --> 15:03.110
Worst case scenario would be
that it's recommended

15:03.160 --> 15:04.870
he's no longer allowed to practice.

15:04.920 --> 15:06.710
Effectively, he'd be struck off.

15:08.990 --> 15:12.680
So you're saying yes.
I have patients. We should go.

15:12.710 --> 15:14.520
Thank you for lunch.
Yeah.

15:14.560 --> 15:16.560
You're welcome. See you, Ruth.

15:17.560 --> 15:19.920
I should follow them,
I still have a duty to supervise.

15:19.950 --> 15:23.470
Martin is a great asset
to this community.

15:23.520 --> 15:26.350
If you punish him,
you'll be punishing them as well.

15:26.400 --> 15:27.870
I really should go.

15:36.080 --> 15:37.830
Well, your spleen seems intact.

15:37.870 --> 15:41.110
There doesn't appear to be
any damage to your internal organs.

15:41.160 --> 15:44.320
I still ache all over.
It was quite the shock.

15:45.590 --> 15:48.200
I suppose I should
count myself lucky it wasn't worse.

15:48.230 --> 15:51.590
However, I am concerned
by your mitral valve.

15:51.630 --> 15:54.590
You appear to have some inflammation
of the endocardium.

15:54.630 --> 15:56.470
Is that to do with the accident?

15:56.520 --> 16:00.440
Your pulse is irregular
and your heartbeat's abnormal.

16:00.470 --> 16:03.870
Have you experienced any
breathlessness or fatigue recently?

16:03.920 --> 16:06.710
Well, I'm on the go all day,
so, yeah, now and then.

16:07.710 --> 16:10.470
And when did that start?
A month or so.

16:10.520 --> 16:13.830
It's been stressful
ever since my Stanley passed.

16:13.870 --> 16:14.870
Who?

16:15.870 --> 16:18.680
My husband. Six months since.

16:18.710 --> 16:21.160
Oh. Type II diabetes, I remember.

16:22.350 --> 16:24.800
It's just me and the boy now.
And he's close to useless.

16:25.990 --> 16:29.710
The lad's gone vegetarian too now,
would you believe?

16:29.750 --> 16:30.950
Stanley will be spinning.

16:30.990 --> 16:33.470
Pull your top down
and roll your sleeve up.

16:33.520 --> 16:37.750
So this inflammation
of the endo thing,

16:37.800 --> 16:40.350
what does that mean?
It means you have endocarditis.

16:41.470 --> 16:44.470
The endocardium is the heart's
inner lining.

16:45.870 --> 16:47.750
I'll take a blood sample
and run some cultures.

16:47.800 --> 16:52.400
Endocarditis generally occurs
when bacteria, germs or fungi

16:52.440 --> 16:53.870
spread through the bloodstream

16:53.920 --> 16:56.280
and attach themselves
to damaged areas in the heart.

16:56.320 --> 16:58.080
No.
Yes.

16:58.110 --> 17:01.350
No, you are here to observe only.

17:01.400 --> 17:03.560
I feel that the patient
would benefit

17:03.590 --> 17:05.240
from some additional information.

17:05.280 --> 17:07.430
No, you do not have permission
to interfere.

17:07.480 --> 17:09.000
You're in my way, wait outside.

17:09.040 --> 17:11.630
It's a little convenient
that you're trying to get rid of me

17:11.670 --> 17:13.430
the moment you're due to draw blood.

17:13.480 --> 17:16.109
None of this is convenient,
and that has nothing to do with it.

17:16.150 --> 17:18.760
So, you won't have an issue
if I stay and watch.

17:19.869 --> 17:21.000
HE CLEARS HIS THROAT

17:35.800 --> 17:37.480
I'll have the results
in the morning,

17:37.520 --> 17:39.350
make an appointment
with the receptionist.

17:39.390 --> 17:41.520
Right you are.

17:47.870 --> 17:50.080
Let me make one thing
perfectly clear, Dr Grayson.

17:50.110 --> 17:53.350
Hedden. No, Dr Ellingham,
let me make it clear.

17:53.390 --> 17:54.560
We are doing this my way,

17:54.590 --> 17:56.430
you do not have a choice
in the matter.

17:56.480 --> 17:58.800
And I have been willing
to overlook a lot so far.

17:58.830 --> 17:59.910
Such as?

17:59.960 --> 18:02.520
The way you snap and bark
at patients.

18:02.560 --> 18:04.350
Your lack of cooperation.
DOG BARKS

18:04.390 --> 18:07.040
The fact you have a dog
running around your surgery.

18:07.080 --> 18:08.350
DOG WHINES

18:16.760 --> 18:17.760
DOG WHINES

18:18.870 --> 18:20.430
DOOR SLAMS

18:20.480 --> 18:22.870
Right, can I go back to my work now?

18:23.960 --> 18:25.240
Your font is too small.

18:25.280 --> 18:27.800
What?
All the public signs in your surgery

18:27.830 --> 18:31.320
have lettering which is below the
acceptable size of CQC guidelines.

18:31.350 --> 18:32.830
That is ridiculous.

18:32.870 --> 18:34.080
No.

18:34.110 --> 18:38.080
Dismissing the threat to your career
for noncompliance is ridiculous.

18:38.110 --> 18:40.280
Who is your registered
first aid responder?

18:40.320 --> 18:42.190
My what?
First aid responder,

18:42.240 --> 18:44.590
you have been told multiple times
that one is necessary,

18:44.630 --> 18:46.960
and yet you refuse to assign one.

18:47.000 --> 18:48.430
It's me.
I...

18:48.480 --> 18:52.280
I've been meaning to file the form
confirming it.

18:52.320 --> 18:54.520
The doc asked me a while back.

18:54.560 --> 18:56.040
Didn't you?
Yes.

18:56.080 --> 19:00.320
He's even agreed to pay me
time and a half for the training.

19:00.350 --> 19:01.430
It's very generous.

19:01.480 --> 19:03.040
I was like, "You can't do that,"

19:03.080 --> 19:06.350
but he insisted, "No, no, no,
it's the least I can do.

19:06.390 --> 19:08.560
"Maybe we should make it
double time."

19:09.670 --> 19:12.040
I'll be back tomorrow, Dr Ellingham.

19:13.040 --> 19:15.320
I think it's worth considering
what's more important,

19:15.350 --> 19:18.040
your career or your pride?

19:18.080 --> 19:21.240
I can help with one...
but not the other.

19:27.480 --> 19:30.870
I'll, er, see you tomorrow, Doc.
If you're still here.

19:33.590 --> 19:34.720
Not double time.

19:36.480 --> 19:37.560
DOOR SHUTS

19:47.720 --> 19:49.630
I would like to apologise.

19:49.670 --> 19:52.870
Ruth did put you in charge,
and you've been doing a great job

19:52.910 --> 19:54.910
of making sure
that this is a success.

19:54.960 --> 19:56.080
I'm proud of you, boy.

19:56.110 --> 19:59.240
Yeah. I'm not changing my mind,
it's still a note on the boat.

19:59.280 --> 20:03.320
Oh, I know. I know.
What we need is a stock-take.

20:03.350 --> 20:06.240
Whiskey, everything,
so we know where we stand

20:06.280 --> 20:07.350
and we can plan ahead.

20:07.390 --> 20:09.240
What are you up to?
Nothing.

20:17.190 --> 20:20.670
Sally.
I have a problem.

20:20.720 --> 20:26.430
Come in, what's happened?
Oh, I just... Oh, I...

20:26.480 --> 20:28.830
I don't know what to wear.

20:28.870 --> 20:32.480
Wear? As in clothes?

20:32.520 --> 20:35.590
A gentleman asked me
to go out with him tomorrow

20:35.630 --> 20:38.480
to Godrevy Lighthouse,
but what does that actually mean?

20:38.520 --> 20:42.080
Casual? Smart-casual? Casual-smart?

20:42.110 --> 20:45.280
Sally, when I told you
you could come round

20:45.320 --> 20:47.110
and talk to me at any time,

20:47.150 --> 20:49.670
I meant more with regard
to Clive's death

20:49.720 --> 20:53.080
and any resulting feelings
of isolation and so forth.

20:53.110 --> 20:57.390
I haven't been on a date
for 35 years.

20:58.910 --> 20:59.910
Oh.

20:59.960 --> 21:01.320
When Clive passed away,

21:01.350 --> 21:04.520
I joined all these clubs
and societies to keep me busy.

21:04.560 --> 21:09.040
And there's this gentleman, Donald,
in the book club.

21:09.080 --> 21:12.870
And he's very pleasant and polite,
and now he's asked me out...

21:12.910 --> 21:15.630
Sally, I do understand...

21:15.670 --> 21:18.560
but I don't want to stand here
and give you some cliche

21:18.590 --> 21:22.240
about how life moves on
and when the time is right,

21:22.280 --> 21:23.870
you'll know it's right...

21:23.910 --> 21:26.390
Oh, oh, that's...

21:26.430 --> 21:28.720
Oh, that's very good, Ruth.
No, I wasn't...

21:28.760 --> 21:31.000
No, that's marvellous. Oh, golly.

21:32.280 --> 21:33.350
Well...

21:34.870 --> 21:38.000
I think the important thing
is to feel comfortable

21:38.040 --> 21:39.720
and be true to yourself.

21:39.760 --> 21:40.870
So...

21:42.670 --> 21:44.560
..smart-casual.

21:45.630 --> 21:47.080
Mm?
Yes.

21:48.150 --> 21:51.590
Thank you, thank you, Ruth.
SHE CHUCKLES

21:51.630 --> 21:53.520
Now... Ooh!

21:55.350 --> 22:00.390
I thought I saw the doc
having lunch with someone today.

22:00.430 --> 22:01.590
A lady...

22:01.630 --> 22:04.240
Dr Hedden from the GMC.

22:04.280 --> 22:06.480
Oh, she's not due till next week,
how did that go?

22:06.520 --> 22:08.760
I-I-It was interesting.

22:11.720 --> 22:16.560
Now... you tell the doc
that if he wants any help,

22:16.590 --> 22:18.520
he can call me any time.

22:20.520 --> 22:22.080
Any time at all.

22:26.590 --> 22:27.630
Bye.

22:32.590 --> 22:33.830
I could write a letter for you,

22:33.870 --> 22:36.150
some platitudes about how
you value her opinion.

22:36.190 --> 22:39.590
I don't value her opinion.
That's why they're platitudes.

22:39.630 --> 22:40.670
No, thank you.

22:42.280 --> 22:44.760
What happens if you lose your job?
I'm not going to lose my job.

22:44.800 --> 22:47.520
I can't say things were helped by
you inviting her to lunch, though.

22:47.560 --> 22:50.350
Yeah, and I realise
that was a mistake.

22:50.390 --> 22:54.240
Plus, I never got a chance
to talk to you about... you know.

22:55.520 --> 22:58.240
Having another child?
Yeah.

22:58.280 --> 23:01.080
I mean, I can't quite believe
we haven't talked about it before.

23:01.110 --> 23:02.870
Mind you,
we haven't exactly been in a place

23:02.910 --> 23:04.110
where we've been able to.

23:04.150 --> 23:05.190
In what way?

23:05.240 --> 23:07.760
Well, in the way that we were meant
to get married,

23:07.800 --> 23:08.960
but neither of us showed up.

23:09.000 --> 23:10.760
And then I left
and came back pregnant

23:10.800 --> 23:11.800
and James was born,

23:11.830 --> 23:14.000
but you were gonna move to London,
but you didn't.

23:14.040 --> 23:16.800
And we did get married,
but then I went to Spain,

23:16.830 --> 23:19.110
and, well, obviously,
I came back and you moved out,

23:19.150 --> 23:21.040
and there was the therapy.

23:21.080 --> 23:23.560
And now I'm training for a new job,
you might lose yours

23:23.590 --> 23:27.240
cos of this whole GMC thing, so...

23:27.280 --> 23:29.150
Yeah. Yeah, there's been a lot on.

23:29.190 --> 23:31.480
Mm. Yes, I see what you mean.

23:32.590 --> 23:35.910
Look, time's getting on,
but it doesn't mean it's run out.

23:35.960 --> 23:37.560
Although,
if we did want another one,

23:37.590 --> 23:39.390
it'd have to be after
I've finish my course

23:39.430 --> 23:42.240
and started my practice.
That's three years.

23:42.280 --> 23:44.960
About that, yeah.
Mm. You're pushing it.

23:45.000 --> 23:48.430
Well, plenty of women
get pregnant in their 40s.

23:48.480 --> 23:50.910
I think you'll find
they're the exception,

23:50.960 --> 23:52.150
rather than the rule.

23:52.190 --> 23:54.040
Do YOU want another child?

23:56.480 --> 23:57.590
Do you?

23:57.630 --> 23:59.000
I don't know.

24:00.240 --> 24:02.480
I always thought I'd have more time
to think about it.

24:03.520 --> 24:05.630
But if I'm already too... you know.

24:05.670 --> 24:07.430
No, I don't.
Yes, you do.

24:07.480 --> 24:10.280
No, I don't.
Too old!

24:10.320 --> 24:14.040
Oh, I see. Yes. No, no, you're not.

24:14.080 --> 24:15.480
I mean, you're... you're mature.

24:15.520 --> 24:18.350
Please don't say that,
it makes me sound like cheese.

24:18.390 --> 24:22.240
Medically-speaking,
to fall pregnant, but, erm...

24:22.280 --> 24:24.590
yes... there's still time.

24:24.630 --> 24:26.040
Yeah, OK.

24:26.080 --> 24:27.960
Not much, though.

24:28.000 --> 24:29.670
Yes, thank you,
Martin, I understand.

24:49.960 --> 24:51.390
Excuse me!

24:51.430 --> 24:53.720
Excuse me!
Yes, hello?

24:53.760 --> 24:55.590
Sally Tishell.

24:55.630 --> 24:57.390
Mrs. Widowed.

24:57.430 --> 24:58.560
Qualified chemist.

24:58.590 --> 25:01.110
Registered with the
General Pharmaceutical Council.

25:01.150 --> 25:05.000
Holder of an accredited
master's degree in pharmacy.

25:05.960 --> 25:07.630
Well, it is nice to meet you.

25:07.670 --> 25:09.480
You're happy with the doctor's work

25:09.520 --> 25:11.910
and are ready to send
a glowing report back about him.

25:11.960 --> 25:14.760
Unfortunately, I'm not at liberty
to discuss the matter,

25:14.800 --> 25:17.190
so I'm sure you understand
why I can't answer your question.

25:17.240 --> 25:18.720
It wasn't a question.

25:23.390 --> 25:24.720
First patient?

25:26.240 --> 25:27.670
Oh, you're back.

25:27.720 --> 25:30.430
As I said, I am here for a week.
At least.

25:30.480 --> 25:33.480
First patient, Doc, Lamorna Hammond.

25:33.520 --> 25:35.830
Lamorna Hammond. Go through.

25:37.190 --> 25:39.390
I've changed all
the fonts in the building.

25:39.430 --> 25:41.910
They now all meet regulation size.

25:43.720 --> 25:46.240
UNDER BREATH: Seemed like a big
deal to everybody yesterday.

25:51.960 --> 25:54.390
Ooh!

25:54.430 --> 25:56.560
Just a minute.

26:01.590 --> 26:03.520
Hello, hello.

26:04.720 --> 26:07.590
The blood cultures reveal
an infection called brucellosis,

26:07.630 --> 26:09.630
caused by the brucella bacteria.

26:09.670 --> 26:13.320
Often contracted by eating infected
meat or drinking infected milk.

26:13.350 --> 26:15.760
It can also lead to endocarditis,

26:15.800 --> 26:19.720
so, we need to establish what it is
you've been consuming to cause this.

26:19.760 --> 26:22.150
It says in your notes that
you are lactose intolerant?

26:22.190 --> 26:24.480
Have been for years, yeah.
Do you eat meat?

26:24.520 --> 26:26.390
Well, normally, we don't bother,

26:26.430 --> 26:29.000
but, like I said,
the boys are veggie.

26:29.040 --> 26:31.630
So, you've eaten no meat
in the past month?

26:31.670 --> 26:34.040
Well, we had a cow die on us,

26:34.080 --> 26:37.000
so, obviously, we turned that
into a couple of burgers and steak.

26:37.040 --> 26:39.320
Farm folk, Doc, waste not want not.

26:39.350 --> 26:41.520
Right, brucellosis spreads
fast amongst cattle.

26:41.560 --> 26:43.720
There'll have to be tests,
but it's very possible

26:43.760 --> 26:45.630
that that's the source
of the infection.

26:45.670 --> 26:47.910
You'll need a prolonged course
of antibiotics

26:47.960 --> 26:50.720
and you'll have to arrange for the
rest of your herd to be slaughtered.

26:51.830 --> 26:53.280
I can't.

26:53.320 --> 26:56.040
Well, find someone who can.
CLEARS THROAT

26:57.520 --> 26:59.080
No, I mean, I don't want to.

27:00.430 --> 27:01.590
There are only five left now

27:01.630 --> 27:03.560
and I promised Stanley
I'd take care of them.

27:03.590 --> 27:07.630
If that meat is infected, there
could be all kinds of complications.

27:07.670 --> 27:09.870
Subacute bacterial endocarditis,

27:09.910 --> 27:11.910
acute chronic meningitis,

27:11.960 --> 27:14.670
encephalitis and neuritis, orchitis.

27:14.720 --> 27:17.110
Cholecystitis, herpetic suppuration,

27:17.150 --> 27:20.000
osteomyelitis -
both sacroiliac and vertebral...

27:20.040 --> 27:22.430
She can't, surely, be expected
to know what all those mean?

27:24.800 --> 27:27.870
Subacute bacterial endocarditis
is a serious condition.

27:27.910 --> 27:30.630
Yeah, I got it, Doc, it's all bad.

27:30.670 --> 27:34.590
But there must be another way?
This isn't fair!

27:34.630 --> 27:38.080
Fair? Fair has nothing
to do with it, they're cows.

27:38.110 --> 27:40.630
If you can't arrange
for them to be destroyed,

27:40.670 --> 27:42.390
then I'll report it
to someone who will.

27:42.430 --> 27:45.520
It's idiotic to be sentimental when
it's putting your health at risk.

27:57.320 --> 28:00.320
Oh, look! It's wonderful!

28:00.350 --> 28:05.190
Yes, home to seagulls,
oystercatchers, pipits.

28:05.240 --> 28:07.910
People aren't allowed on the island
without permission.

28:07.960 --> 28:10.520
But we have permission... don't we?

28:10.560 --> 28:14.830
Well, we've got the keys to the
lighthouse, so... more or less, yes.

28:14.870 --> 28:18.520
Well, I'm a pillar of the community,
I can't break the law.

28:18.560 --> 28:21.480
Don't worry, Sally,
we're not breaking the law!

28:21.520 --> 28:25.520
Only a few people get to visit
Godrevy, we're lucky.

28:32.800 --> 28:35.590
May I ask the patient a question,
Doctor Ellingham?

28:37.560 --> 28:38.830
Yes.

28:40.430 --> 28:42.190
How does this make you feel?

28:42.240 --> 28:44.520
The way Doctor Ellingham
talked to you?

28:44.560 --> 28:47.630
Suggesting you are, "Idiotic."

28:47.670 --> 28:50.280
I said her actions were idiotic,
not her personally.

28:52.480 --> 28:53.720
Honestly...

28:55.150 --> 28:56.830
..it's a bit upsetting.

28:56.870 --> 28:59.040
I don't think the doc
understands what it means

28:59.080 --> 29:01.000
to tell a farmer they've
got to cull the herd.

29:01.040 --> 29:02.760
And it's the sort of thing

29:02.800 --> 29:05.520
that might make you think twice
about coming back here,

29:05.560 --> 29:07.000
if you had a problem?

29:08.870 --> 29:10.670
Right.

29:10.720 --> 29:12.110
So, you think I'm stupid, too?

29:13.430 --> 29:15.150
No, not at all!

29:15.190 --> 29:16.830
Or just some local yokel?

29:17.960 --> 29:20.320
Who'll say what you want
with a bit of prodding and pushing?

29:20.350 --> 29:22.280
No, I think you've misunderstood.
No, no, no,

29:22.320 --> 29:24.670
I understand fine.

29:24.720 --> 29:28.150
The doc might be a rude tosser,
but at least he talks straight

29:28.190 --> 29:30.670
and that's appreciated round here.

29:30.720 --> 29:32.320
You want to sit and take notes?

29:32.350 --> 29:36.320
Take notes on that! And stop
sticking words into my mouth!

29:40.800 --> 29:42.000
Any further questions?

29:46.320 --> 29:48.560
No, thank you.

29:48.590 --> 29:51.430
Be careful on those steps, Sally!
Oh, I'm fine.

29:55.630 --> 29:57.150
SEAGULLS CRY

29:57.190 --> 29:59.390
Here we are.

29:59.430 --> 30:01.560
How lovely to be in Woolf country!

30:01.590 --> 30:04.960
Yes, such a wonderful book.

30:05.000 --> 30:06.350
What was your favourite part?

30:06.390 --> 30:09.390
Er, ooh, I liked...

30:09.430 --> 30:13.960
all the, um...
all the lighthouse stuff.

30:15.480 --> 30:18.630
And the final page,
was very powerful.

30:18.670 --> 30:20.000
It was, wasn't it?

30:20.040 --> 30:23.870
" 'Yes,' she thought, laying down
her brush in extreme fatigues,

30:23.910 --> 30:26.110
" 'I have had my vision.' "

30:26.150 --> 30:28.320
You know, you're quite
unique for Portwenn, Sally.

30:28.350 --> 30:31.080
I can't think of anyone else
around here with whom one

30:31.110 --> 30:33.800
can discuss art
and the finer things of life.

30:33.830 --> 30:36.670
Oh, well, I'm sure the doc would
have some remarkable insights.

30:36.720 --> 30:39.670
The doc (?) Oh, yes, very good.

30:39.720 --> 30:41.870
The man's so stiff
you could lay him on his side

30:41.910 --> 30:43.080
and use him as a shelf (!)

30:44.320 --> 30:47.000
We'll agree to disagree on that one.

30:47.040 --> 30:48.480
Oh.

30:50.630 --> 30:52.480
Oh, my goodness.

30:52.520 --> 30:54.320
Here we are!
Ooh!

30:56.480 --> 30:58.320
PANTING

30:59.350 --> 31:02.590
It's 950 steps to the top.

31:02.630 --> 31:04.000
950?

31:04.040 --> 31:07.870
Well, it'll be worth it.
God, I hope so.

31:07.910 --> 31:09.390
Oof.

31:14.870 --> 31:17.800
BREATHLESS: Nearly there.
Good! Ha!

31:17.830 --> 31:19.110
Careful.

31:21.720 --> 31:24.350
After you.
Oh, thank you.

31:24.390 --> 31:26.150
It's very steep.

31:34.080 --> 31:35.280
Oh!

31:37.320 --> 31:38.720
SHE GASPS

31:41.480 --> 31:43.000
Come on, this way.

31:44.040 --> 31:45.280
Oh.

31:48.560 --> 31:52.390
Oh, my! This is quite the view!

31:52.430 --> 31:54.430
Isn't it just?

31:54.480 --> 31:56.000
Here we go.

31:56.040 --> 31:58.630
Oh! Oh, thank you.

31:58.670 --> 32:00.560
SHE LAUGHS,
SIGHS CONTENTEDLY

32:02.150 --> 32:03.830
I hope you're enjoying yourself?

32:03.870 --> 32:05.870
Oh, I am, I'm glad I came.

32:05.910 --> 32:08.830
I almost didn't, it's been a while.

32:13.590 --> 32:16.590
It must be difficult, losing Clive?

32:16.630 --> 32:18.350
He annoyed me.

32:18.390 --> 32:22.190
And then one day he wasn't around
to be annoying any more.

32:22.240 --> 32:23.430
I miss it.

32:23.480 --> 32:24.870
Being annoyed with him?

32:24.910 --> 32:27.630
Being something with him. Anything!

32:29.190 --> 32:30.670
I think I could have been, um...

32:33.000 --> 32:34.760
..a better wife.

32:34.800 --> 32:37.240
I'm sure you tried your best.

32:38.560 --> 32:44.560
Clive used to say
that sometimes I was elsewhere.

32:44.590 --> 32:46.800
Well, not physically, I mean.

32:46.830 --> 32:49.430
Emotionally?
Yes.

32:52.720 --> 32:55.350
You don't need to feel bad any more.

32:55.390 --> 32:58.280
No. I suppose not.

33:01.080 --> 33:03.760
TEARFULLY: It's just that
now that Clive's gone,

33:03.800 --> 33:06.150
there's an empty space
and I don't know how to fill it.

33:10.350 --> 33:11.630
No, no, no! I'm sorry, I can't!

33:11.670 --> 33:14.390
Sally! Wait!

33:14.430 --> 33:16.430
Ooh.

33:16.480 --> 33:19.390
Sally!
That's not why I came here!

33:19.430 --> 33:22.480
I apologise. It was clumsy of me,
let's just forget it.

33:22.520 --> 33:24.430
No, I think it's better
if I just leave.

33:24.480 --> 33:25.590
SHE YELLS OUT
Sally!

33:25.630 --> 33:27.150
CRASHING
Oh!

33:29.000 --> 33:30.350
Sally!
Uh...

33:30.390 --> 33:31.390
Sally...
Oh.

33:31.430 --> 33:33.000
..are you all right?

33:33.040 --> 33:34.480
AGONISED GROANS

33:37.040 --> 33:38.110
Sally!
Ooh.

33:38.150 --> 33:39.760
Sally?
Ooh.

33:42.520 --> 33:44.480
No...

33:44.520 --> 33:47.110
No, I am not.

33:47.150 --> 33:49.560
Right.

33:49.590 --> 33:51.560
No need to panic.

33:53.080 --> 33:56.080
I have a screwdriver
sticking out my arm.

33:57.240 --> 34:01.560
Call the doctor!

34:01.590 --> 34:03.800
Try and keep them
as clean and dry as possible.

34:03.830 --> 34:06.670
PHONE RINGS
'Portwenn surgery.'

34:08.440 --> 34:11.670
Yeah, OK, all right,
slow down, um, hold on.

34:11.710 --> 34:14.520
Um, Doc, it's an emergency,
it's Donald Abbott.

34:15.670 --> 34:17.880
Yes?
'Er, hello, Sally, er...'

34:17.920 --> 34:21.880
Mrs Tishell, managed to trip over
and injure herself.

34:21.920 --> 34:25.190
'Oh, I just need a second.'

34:25.230 --> 34:29.710
Hello, Doctor, it's Sally Tishell,

34:29.750 --> 34:32.670
Um... I have a screwdriver

34:32.710 --> 34:36.190
'lodged in my forearm,
an inch below the elbow joint.'

34:36.230 --> 34:39.520
Right, whatever you do,
don't pull it out. Where are you?

34:39.560 --> 34:41.670
At the top of Godrevy lighthouse.

34:41.710 --> 34:43.360
Well,
what on earth are you doing there?

34:43.400 --> 34:45.110
'Well, there was this book club'

34:45.150 --> 34:47.110
somebody chose Virginia Woolf,
to be honest,

34:47.150 --> 34:49.400
I couldn't get past the
first chapter, it was so boring.

34:49.440 --> 34:51.230
'All right,
stop talking and listen to me.'

34:51.270 --> 34:53.440
Apply pressure to the wound
to stop the bleeding,

34:53.480 --> 34:55.440
but don't push
the screwdriver in any further.

34:55.480 --> 34:58.520
Lie down and raise your arm
on a table or chair.

34:58.560 --> 35:00.880
Wait for me and stay calm.

35:00.920 --> 35:02.920
Call Penhale and have him
get the lifeboat

35:02.960 --> 35:05.110
and meet me to take me
to Godrevy Island, please.

35:09.360 --> 35:11.360
Thank you, Doctor.

35:22.230 --> 35:23.360
DOG BARKS

35:27.840 --> 35:29.710
HORN HONKS
'Come on!'

35:29.750 --> 35:32.360
You're gonna to have to move this
forward or backwards.

35:32.400 --> 35:35.920
We can't move it, Joe, some moron's
parked it and gone off somewhere.

35:35.960 --> 35:37.150
Where's the lifeboat?

35:37.190 --> 35:41.480
A slight issue, a moron's parked
in front of the lifeboat place.

35:41.520 --> 35:43.630
It's all under control though.

35:43.670 --> 35:45.790
Crisis management is my forte.

35:45.840 --> 35:46.960
I need a boat NOW.

35:48.520 --> 35:50.480
Some say it's an alpha male trait.

35:50.520 --> 35:52.750
Right, it's that one, that's 27...

35:52.790 --> 35:54.560
Hey!
..28...

35:54.590 --> 35:57.710
So, this is your idea
of a stock-take, is it?

35:57.750 --> 35:59.520
Listen, I can explain everything...

35:59.560 --> 36:01.960
You're paying for a share
of the boat with whiskey,

36:02.000 --> 36:03.400
even though I told you not to.

36:03.440 --> 36:05.230
You said you'd cleared it with him.

36:05.270 --> 36:06.560
Figure of speech.

36:06.590 --> 36:08.750
That's about 700 quid's worth
of stock there.

36:08.790 --> 36:10.150
Right, bugger this!

36:11.670 --> 36:13.590
Call me when you've decided
what you wanna do.

36:13.630 --> 36:18.080
Look, you may be in charge,
but I've run businesses all my life!

36:18.110 --> 36:19.520
Yes, run them into the ground!

36:19.560 --> 36:21.840
Is this your boat, now?
Yes.  No, oh.

36:21.880 --> 36:23.480
Doesn't matter, get me to Godrevy.

36:23.520 --> 36:25.150
No, Doc, no. This boat's in use.

36:25.190 --> 36:28.150
No, it's not, come on,
I've got to get to Godrevy.

36:28.190 --> 36:31.000
Not you, you get seasick, don't you?
What? No, I don't.

36:31.040 --> 36:34.360
Anyway, you need someone
to pilot the boat. Oh.

36:34.400 --> 36:37.710
Oh, really?!  Non-negotiable,
means non-negotiable.

36:37.750 --> 36:39.670
Penhale to the rescue again!

36:39.710 --> 36:41.000
You can let go now.

36:42.480 --> 36:45.040
Doc, just wait a minute!
ENGINE STARTS

36:45.080 --> 36:46.880
We'll be back.

37:21.360 --> 37:23.590
Right, be careful, Penhale,
it's quite shallow here.

37:23.630 --> 37:27.520
It's an emergency, Doc.
Stop worrying.

37:27.560 --> 37:29.310
I know these waters
like the back of my hand.

37:29.360 --> 37:31.150
Can you look where you're going?

37:34.190 --> 37:35.920
THE BOAT JUDDERS

37:35.960 --> 37:38.080
What happened?

37:38.110 --> 37:40.960
It's just a... sea bump.

37:42.270 --> 37:45.040
Er, I don't mean to worry you,
but water's coming in.

37:45.080 --> 37:46.360
Oh, you idiot!

37:46.400 --> 37:47.520
We're sinking!

37:48.750 --> 37:51.040
I can confirm,
there is a hole in the boat.

37:51.080 --> 37:52.840
Right, we need to lighten the load.

37:52.880 --> 37:55.110
Doc, we can't throw her over.

37:55.150 --> 37:57.480
Actually, can you swim?
It's not that far to shore.

37:57.520 --> 37:59.110
Just give me a hand!

37:59.150 --> 38:01.360
Should we be doing this, Doc?

38:01.400 --> 38:02.960
It's either that or sink.

38:03.000 --> 38:04.190
Good point.

38:06.840 --> 38:08.710
THEY STRAIN

38:14.590 --> 38:16.520
Right, that should do it. Let's go.

38:29.040 --> 38:30.440
Is he actually a policeman?

38:30.480 --> 38:32.110
Yes.

38:36.480 --> 38:39.040
Mrs Tishell?
Oh, I'm up here!

38:39.080 --> 38:41.310
BREATHLESS: Wonderful.

38:42.520 --> 38:44.670
Doctor.
Don't move, sit down.

38:44.710 --> 38:46.080
Yes.

38:46.110 --> 38:47.150
What are you doing here?

38:47.190 --> 38:48.960
You told me I could go about
my daily life.

38:49.000 --> 38:51.520
I meant get some rest,
not go chasing around lighthouses.

38:51.560 --> 38:53.670
What? Did you have to bring her?

38:53.710 --> 38:55.360
Shush.

38:55.400 --> 38:57.560
She's lost a lot of blood.

38:57.590 --> 38:58.790
HE GAGS
Yes.

38:58.840 --> 39:01.080
Are you sure you're all right
to continue, Dr Ellingham?

39:01.110 --> 39:02.360
Do you need me to step in?

39:02.400 --> 39:05.400
A screwdriver has punctured
a branch of the brachial artery.

39:05.440 --> 39:08.000
I'll have to pull it out.

39:08.040 --> 39:09.920
I need you to keep your arm
completely still.

39:09.960 --> 39:11.790
I won't move a muscle, doc.

39:11.840 --> 39:13.190
I'll get you something to bite on.

39:14.150 --> 39:15.400
Here you are.

39:18.040 --> 39:19.560
Right, look away.

39:19.590 --> 39:21.080
Look away.

39:21.110 --> 39:22.440
Look away.

39:26.920 --> 39:28.110
SHE WINCES

39:30.040 --> 39:32.190
Oh!
Doctor?

39:32.230 --> 39:33.520
I'm fine, give me some space.

39:37.750 --> 39:39.040
HE VOMITS

39:40.670 --> 39:42.790
PENHALE: The boat's a write-off,

39:42.840 --> 39:44.840
but the lifeboat's on its way.

39:44.880 --> 39:46.560
Oh, dear.

39:46.590 --> 39:48.750
Don't worry, I'm here.
Don't touch her, she's...

39:50.270 --> 39:51.560
Ah!

39:55.150 --> 39:57.270
Oh, God...

39:57.310 --> 39:59.590
You all right?

39:59.630 --> 40:01.360
Ouch.

40:03.670 --> 40:05.670
The shock must
have stopped her heart.

40:05.710 --> 40:07.440
Let's get her away from these wires.

40:13.560 --> 40:15.920
Be terrible if she died, Doctor.

40:21.360 --> 40:22.840
She's not responding to the CPR.

40:22.880 --> 40:24.750
I'll have to give her
a precordial thump.

40:24.790 --> 40:27.670
Pre... That's very dangerous,
Doctor, go ahead.

40:27.710 --> 40:29.150
I can't watch.

40:33.040 --> 40:34.040
SHE GASPS

40:36.670 --> 40:38.400
Yup, that did it,
the heart's got a rhythm.

40:38.440 --> 40:39.960
Now, what's your name?
Donald.

40:40.000 --> 40:42.480
Call the ambulance and have
them meet us on the Portwenn Side.

40:42.520 --> 40:43.630
The lifeboat's coming.

40:43.670 --> 40:46.880
Well, can you help me get her up
and get her downstairs?

40:49.150 --> 40:50.400
Thank you, Doctor.

40:50.440 --> 40:53.230
You came running in my hour of need.
Yes.

40:55.880 --> 40:56.880
What?

41:05.150 --> 41:07.960
Here, where's the boat?

41:08.000 --> 41:09.590
Don't worry, the boat's fine.

41:09.630 --> 41:11.520
A little bit of a, er, rip in it.

41:11.560 --> 41:13.150
A rip?

41:13.190 --> 41:15.360
Please tell me
it didn't bloody sink?

41:15.400 --> 41:17.520
No, it didn't "bloody sink."

41:17.560 --> 41:20.920
We tossed the whisky overboard
so it stayed afloat, so it's fine.

41:20.960 --> 41:23.880
You've damaged his boat
and thrown away all my whisky?!

41:23.920 --> 41:26.230
It was a police emergency.

41:26.270 --> 41:27.790
Bollocks.

41:27.840 --> 41:30.000
Look, you'll be compensated.

41:30.040 --> 41:32.630
Although it's quite
a complicated procedure,

41:32.670 --> 41:34.790
lots of forms, lots of paperwork,

41:34.840 --> 41:38.150
so how about I buy you guys a pint
and we call it quits?

41:38.190 --> 41:39.630
Bollocks.

41:39.670 --> 41:41.150
Two pints?

41:42.670 --> 41:44.840
Fine, I'll get on
with the paperwork.

41:44.880 --> 41:46.630
Oh, thank you.

41:50.840 --> 41:54.480
Oh, thank you for, erm...

41:54.520 --> 41:56.630
For an interesting morning.

41:56.670 --> 41:58.840
I'd ask if there
was gonna be another one,

41:58.880 --> 42:01.630
but I have a feeling
perhaps you are elsewhere?

42:03.190 --> 42:04.840
As Woolf herself said,

42:04.880 --> 42:07.190
"One cannot find peace
by avoiding life."

42:07.230 --> 42:08.840
Oh, I never actually read that book.

42:08.880 --> 42:10.440
Yes, I gathered that.

42:10.480 --> 42:13.040
Well, I've gotta go now,
things to do.

42:13.080 --> 42:16.230
All right. See you at the book club,
then, Sally Tishell.

42:16.270 --> 42:17.880
Only if I can choose the book.

42:21.040 --> 42:22.560
You're gonna be taken to hospital,

42:22.590 --> 42:24.960
where they'll monitor
your heart rhythm for 24 hours

42:25.000 --> 42:27.360
and they'll, erm,
treat the burns on your hands.

42:27.400 --> 42:30.000
Your chest will be sore
and it'll hurt to breathe

42:30.040 --> 42:32.190
because of the bruising
from the thump I gave you.

42:32.230 --> 42:33.270
Do you understand?
Yes.

42:33.310 --> 42:35.840
Right, I'll call the hospital
and monitor your recovery.

42:35.880 --> 42:37.590
I still need to deliver my report,

42:37.630 --> 42:39.520
so you'll be hearing from me,
as well.

42:41.270 --> 42:42.270
Yes.

42:43.880 --> 42:47.150
Come on, Chippy.
You've been here all day, mate.

42:47.190 --> 42:49.920
Well, I wanna drink some more.
I know you do,

42:49.960 --> 42:52.880
which is exactly why you should
get on home and sleep it off.

42:52.920 --> 42:54.750
Well, I don't wanna sleep it off.

42:54.790 --> 42:56.150
I know. On your bike, mate.

42:56.190 --> 42:58.310
Be careful, good luck.

42:58.360 --> 43:00.560
Yes, yes, I know I'm late.

43:00.590 --> 43:02.000
I haven't said anything.

43:02.040 --> 43:04.190
You were going to, though.
No, no.

43:04.230 --> 43:07.880
I mean, sure, you did say you'd
be here, what, over an hour ago.

43:07.920 --> 43:10.880
You do realise
this isn't actually my job?

43:10.920 --> 43:12.190
And if it was, I'd quit.

43:14.360 --> 43:16.750
Oh, look, you're right.
You're right, I'm sorry.

43:16.790 --> 43:18.110
I'm sorry.

43:18.150 --> 43:20.040
I've been a bit stressed,
this is the one chance

43:20.080 --> 43:22.630
I've got of actually having
a business that works out.

43:24.790 --> 43:25.920
I appreciate you.

43:25.960 --> 43:29.000
SHE SNIGGERS
You appreciate me?!

43:29.040 --> 43:31.190
Yeah, that didn't sound great,
did it?

43:31.230 --> 43:32.670
Er...

43:32.710 --> 43:34.880
I'm not good at saying
this kind of thing.

43:35.960 --> 43:37.110
What I meant was...

43:38.270 --> 43:39.440
..I love you.

43:40.880 --> 43:42.000
Go on.

43:42.040 --> 43:44.150
And you're amazing.

43:44.190 --> 43:45.710
Is that it?
No!

43:45.750 --> 43:48.560
No, and you're the most
important thing in my life and...

43:48.590 --> 43:51.670
I couldn't imagine
not being with you.

43:51.710 --> 43:53.310
What a lovely proposal.

43:53.360 --> 43:55.310
I thought I told you
to go home, Chippy?

43:55.360 --> 43:57.310
Wait, that was a proposal?

43:57.360 --> 43:58.440
Of course it was!

44:00.000 --> 44:02.880
Al, was it?

44:04.840 --> 44:06.150
Yeah, I suppose it was.

44:07.520 --> 44:08.520
Yes!

44:08.560 --> 44:10.880
Yes?
The answer is yes!

44:10.920 --> 44:12.190
Is it?

44:12.230 --> 44:13.710
CHIPPY CHEERS

44:13.750 --> 44:15.000
OK?
Hmm.

44:15.040 --> 44:16.310
Congratulations!

44:18.080 --> 44:22.270
Everyone, Al just proposed
to Morwenna and she said yes!

44:22.310 --> 44:24.840
Drinks on the house!
CHEERING

44:27.190 --> 44:28.880
You didn't tell me
you were gonna propose.

44:28.920 --> 44:32.880
I didn't know I was gonna propose,
it sort of slipped out.

44:32.920 --> 44:34.840
But you meant it, right?

44:36.080 --> 44:37.150
Er...

44:43.920 --> 44:46.080
Electrocuted?
Mm-hmm.

44:46.110 --> 44:47.590
And then her heart stopped.

44:47.630 --> 44:49.360
But you got it started again.

44:49.400 --> 44:51.590
Mm. Can you pass the pepper, please?

44:52.790 --> 44:54.000
Is that good or bad?

44:54.040 --> 44:55.670
Well, it's good for her.

44:55.710 --> 44:57.880
I don't know if it'll affect
her assessment, or not.

44:57.920 --> 44:59.000
Are you worried about that?

45:00.440 --> 45:01.670
No, I'm not.

45:01.710 --> 45:05.310
Well, I'm worried. It could have
serious implications for our future.

45:05.360 --> 45:07.040
Is this about us
having a second child?

45:08.440 --> 45:10.440
Well, it makes things uncertain,
doesn't it?

45:10.480 --> 45:12.750
And I know you don't want
another child anyway.

45:12.790 --> 45:13.840
I didn't say that.

45:16.520 --> 45:18.110
So, you want another child?

45:18.150 --> 45:19.960
If that's what you want, yes.

45:21.880 --> 45:23.520
You'd have a second child?

45:23.560 --> 45:25.190
If you want to, yes.

45:25.230 --> 45:27.520
You're not going to say
that I'm too old, or something?

45:27.560 --> 45:30.480
No, I'm not. Whatever decision
you make, I'll support you.

45:32.400 --> 45:33.560
Thank you, Martin.

45:33.590 --> 45:35.360
You're welcome.

45:35.400 --> 45:36.590
Can I have the pepper, please?

45:36.630 --> 45:37.790
Yeah, sorry.

45:49.190 --> 45:52.670
They want me to do three refresher
courses, starting with lobotomy.

45:52.710 --> 45:55.150
It's our prize goat,
she's jealous of our happiness!

45:55.190 --> 45:56.560
He knows what we get up to.

45:56.590 --> 45:58.710
We are very compatible, physically.

45:59.750 --> 46:02.590
Have you thought about how you are
going to deal with your hemophobia?

46:02.630 --> 46:04.750
Once I have located a suitable vein,

46:04.790 --> 46:08.790
I will insert the needle
and take the blood.

46:08.840 --> 46:11.520
