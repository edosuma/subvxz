We get it.

15:58.958 --> 16:02.336
You're the greatest camper

15:58.958 --> 16:02.336

16:02.378 --> 16:04.505
Well, I sure don't need

16:02.378 --> 16:04.505
any of that silly stuff

16:04.547 --> 16:07.133
you're luggin' around.

16:07.174 --> 16:10.010
The things you

16:07.174 --> 16:10.010
gave me are silly?

16:10.052 --> 16:11.053
Just look in a mirror!

16:11.095 --> 16:13.807
Guess I shoulda told

16:11.095 --> 16:13.807
ya that before, huh?

16:13.848 --> 16:15.141
Heh heh heh!

16:15.182 --> 16:16.434
[gasp]

16:21.063 --> 16:23.942
Glad I was so

16:21.063 --> 16:23.942
entertaining for you.

16:26.778 --> 16:29.405
I'm going to make sure she

16:26.778 --> 16:29.405
doesn't break a hoof out there

16:29.447 --> 16:33.284
and then you and I are going

16:29.447 --> 16:33.284
to have a serious talk.

16:33.326 --> 16:35.495
Finally!

16:35.536 --> 16:37.622
There. That's all of you.

16:41.375 --> 16:43.962

16:41.375 --> 16:43.962

16:48.675 --> 16:53.053
The time for my revenge on

16:48.675 --> 16:53.053
Starlight Glimmer has come.

16:53.095 --> 16:57.224
Let's see if you're telling

16:53.095 --> 16:57.224
the truth about this tree.

16:57.266 --> 16:59.477
Ha ha ha!

17:02.104 --> 17:03.272
[Rarity] Starlight!

17:03.314 --> 17:05.316
Oh, please stop running.

17:07.109 --> 17:08.945

17:12.490 --> 17:14.826
Of course I care

17:12.490 --> 17:14.826
about Fluttershy!

17:14.868 --> 17:18.329
Then you got a super-weird

17:14.868 --> 17:18.329
way of showing it!

17:18.371 --> 17:20.623
[Rarity] What in Equestria

17:18.371 --> 17:20.623
is going on here?

17:20.665 --> 17:23.918
Twilight is so

17:20.665 --> 17:23.918
into her "retreat"

17:23.960 --> 17:26.212
that she doesn't even care

17:23.960 --> 17:26.212
if her friends are upset!

17:26.253 --> 17:27.714
She just wants us to stay.

17:27.755 --> 17:29.841
On

17:27.755 --> 17:29.841

17:30.341 --> 17:32.802
Well, I'm sorry Pinkie!

17:32.844 --> 17:35.972
If I knew you thought this was

17:32.844 --> 17:35.972
a "boring lame no fun retreat"

17:36.014 --> 17:38.307
I wouldn't have invited

17:36.014 --> 17:38.307
you in the first!

17:38.349 --> 17:40.226
I never said that!

17:40.267 --> 17:41.686
Sorry, y'all.

17:41.728 --> 17:44.397
We woulda been here sooner but

17:41.728 --> 17:44.397
we had to take the long way

17:44.438 --> 17:46.900
after Rarity ran off

17:44.438 --> 17:46.900
with all my stuff!

17:46.941 --> 17:49.360
I most certainly

17:46.941 --> 17:49.360
did not!

17:49.402 --> 17:51.863
What? You know I

17:49.402 --> 17:51.863
ain't no liar!

17:51.905 --> 17:53.489
Where's all your gear?

17:53.531 --> 17:56.075
Why? So you can laugh

17:53.531 --> 17:56.075
at me some more?

17:56.116 --> 17:58.327
Hey hey! We're

17:56.116 --> 17:58.327
all friends here!

17:58.369 --> 17:59.787
Friends?

17:59.829 --> 18:01.998
You left me alone

17:59.829 --> 18:01.998
in the woods!

Everypony, quiet!

18:09.171 --> 18:10.506
Listen.

18:10.548 --> 18:12.050
We know each other really well.

18:12.091 --> 18:15.803
The great stuff and how to

18:12.091 --> 18:15.803
get on each other's nerves, too.

18:15.845 --> 18:18.014
I wanted a fun trip

18:15.845 --> 18:18.014
with my friends.

18:18.056 --> 18:20.516
But instead, I got carried

18:18.056 --> 18:20.516
away with plans

18:20.558 --> 18:22.142
and ruined everything.

18:22.184 --> 18:25.688
If you want to forget it all and

18:22.184 --> 18:25.688
head home, I won't be offended.

18:25.730 --> 18:28.482
I just want us to stop fighting.

18:28.524 --> 18:30.526
Hey, sorry if I

18:28.524 --> 18:30.526
got carried away

18:30.568 --> 18:32.403
with all that

18:30.568 --> 18:32.403
campin' stuff.

18:32.445 --> 18:33.696
I'm sorry, too.

18:33.738 --> 18:36.365
I should've just told you

18:33.738 --> 18:36.365
I'll never like camping.

18:36.407 --> 18:38.785
Also, I'll never

18:36.407 --> 18:38.785
like camping.

18:38.826 --> 18:41.037
Well, if we're all

18:38.826 --> 18:41.037
being honest...

18:41.079 --> 18:43.414
I can't survive with just

18:41.079 --> 18:43.414
this tiny efashionable

18:43.456 --> 18:44.874
little saddle bag!

18:44.916 --> 18:47.877
I miss my things!

18:47.919 --> 18:50.546
I'm sorry that you thought that

18:47.919 --> 18:50.546
I thought your plan was lame!

18:50.588 --> 18:53.091
Your plans are

18:50.588 --> 18:53.091
the most unlamest!

18:53.132 --> 18:56.719
And I always have fun

18:53.132 --> 18:56.719
when we're all together.

Even if it's learning

18:56.761 --> 18:59.889

18:59.931 --> 19:03.183
So does that mean you still

18:59.931 --> 19:03.183
want to have the retreat?

19:03.225 --> 19:04.602
Yes!
