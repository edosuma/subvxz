I used to shave my father's
face when I was young.

03:03.716 --> 03:04.850
He must have trusted you.

04:49.788 --> 04:50.857
Hey!

04:50.956 --> 04:51.790
Shit.

04:54.992 --> 04:56.995
Oh! Aw!

04:58.629 --> 04:59.499
Nice ride.

05:00.333 --> 05:01.634
What are you hiding
back there, huh?

05:01.733 --> 05:02.601
Where's Moze?

05:02.935 --> 05:04.370
Oh, he's down by the beach.

05:04.470 --> 05:05.638
Making the most of the time away

05:05.737 --> 05:07.406
from his responsibilities.
Getting drunk.

05:07.507 --> 05:09.675
Second wife, new kid.

05:09.776 --> 05:10.776
He's changed.

05:11.543 --> 05:12.310
All grown up.

05:14.713 --> 05:16.049
But not us, right?

05:18.016 --> 05:19.052
How's work treating you?

05:19.785 --> 05:21.621
- It's good.
- Oh, good.

05:21.721 --> 05:22.988
Well, come on inside.

05:23.721 --> 05:24.589
I'll set you up.

05:29.961 --> 05:31.331
When were you here last?

05:32.865 --> 05:34.067
Must have been ten years?

05:37.536 --> 05:40.038
This is the basement now.

05:41.105 --> 05:42.507
That's a bedroom.

05:44.410 --> 05:45.611
You don't want to know
how much money

05:45.711 --> 05:46.679
I dumped into this place.

05:47.879 --> 05:48.747
Let's go upstairs.

05:49.747 --> 05:51.416
And, uh, I'll give you the tour.

06:00.692 --> 06:01.894
Huh!

06:08.132 --> 06:09.401
Liz still dabbles.

06:09.968 --> 06:11.771
Worries people
don't get her work.

06:14.173 --> 06:15.841
Kitchen's all been redone.

06:18.744 --> 06:19.912
Damn faucet.

06:20.745 --> 06:21.781
I have to fix it.

06:23.882 --> 06:25.752
All the water's
from that old well out front.

06:26.451 --> 06:27.552
Smells like sulfur.

06:27.985 --> 06:28.855
Liz likes it,

06:29.588 --> 06:30.623
thinks it's rustic.

06:31.088 --> 06:32.458
I think it smells like shit.

06:32.990 --> 06:35.060
But... you can still drink it.

06:37.196 --> 06:38.765
The big room is over there.

06:39.665 --> 06:41.867
You and Moze can fight
for it like old times.

06:41.968 --> 06:42.902
You know, yeah.

06:50.141 --> 06:51.511
The loft's all new.

06:52.577 --> 06:53.445
Liz's idea.

06:54.245 --> 06:55.647
She's always had taste.

07:00.084 --> 07:00.952
Want a beer?

07:14.632 --> 07:16.568
This almost makes
everything worth it.

07:17.502 --> 07:18.603
What does?

07:19.237 --> 07:20.105
The view.

07:23.574 --> 07:24.509
It's worth it.

07:30.716 --> 07:31.716
Hmm.

07:31.817 --> 07:32.785
There he is.

07:35.220 --> 07:37.056
Get up here, you gypsy bastard!

07:37.156 --> 07:38.524
- Jack's here.
- Jack!

07:38.824 --> 07:40.660
Oh, man. Am I glad to see you.

07:40.759 --> 07:42.228
Ah, goddammit!

07:42.327 --> 07:44.229
Asshole,
I'm not here for your pleasure.

07:46.163 --> 07:47.834
What's up, buddy?

07:47.934 --> 07:49.735
- How are you doing, Jackie?
- It's good to see you, Moze.

07:49.834 --> 07:50.802
Yeah, of course it is.

07:53.838 --> 07:55.475
Where were
you before Maine again?

07:56.742 --> 07:57.610
Virginia.

07:58.709 --> 08:00.145
You got to settle down, man.

08:00.812 --> 08:02.648
Right? You can't build
anything that way.

08:03.247 --> 08:04.115
Ha!

08:04.216 --> 08:05.550
Who-hoo-hoo-hoo!

08:06.117 --> 08:08.721
Where the hell did
you find this thing?

08:09.855 --> 08:10.857
Business trip.

08:10.956 --> 08:12.024
New Orleans.

08:13.291 --> 08:14.826
That explains everything.

08:21.699 --> 08:23.502
- Quit, quit!
- You quit.

08:24.136 --> 08:25.872
Do you remember
that time that

08:25.971 --> 08:27.507
Moze walked out
on the deck and...

08:29.675 --> 08:31.576
...and the whole thing
started shaking?

08:34.779 --> 08:36.081
Yeah,
I remember it vividly.

08:36.182 --> 08:37.283
Everybody ran inside while

08:37.383 --> 08:38.650
I rode that deck to the ground.

08:42.220 --> 08:43.556
You don't remember?

08:45.957 --> 08:46.992
Oh, I wasn't there.

08:48.693 --> 08:51.129
Ah, that's right.
You were with Liz.

08:55.667 --> 08:56.569
How is she?

08:58.102 --> 08:59.137
She wants a kid.

09:00.139 --> 09:01.706
Thinks that's the answer
to the great question.

09:01.807 --> 09:02.807
Questions?

09:04.009 --> 09:05.278
We don't
need no stinking questions.

09:05.378 --> 09:07.613
- No.
- No, no, no, no, no.

09:11.015 --> 09:11.918
Oh!

09:13.351 --> 09:15.654
I want to take you guys
out to the dunes tomorrow.

09:17.221 --> 09:19.125
There's space out there.

09:19.791 --> 09:20.760
Men need that.

09:32.971 --> 09:34.941
You know, you didn't say
anything about climbing.

09:39.811 --> 09:40.913
Come on, you scamp.

09:42.346 --> 09:44.783
Hey, guys, there's a rope.
Just...

09:49.388 --> 09:50.790
Not bad, huh?

09:52.024 --> 09:55.126
Thousands of years ago, all
this was covered in glaciers.

09:56.260 --> 09:59.631
When they melted, they left
these piles of sand behind.

10:05.169 --> 10:06.038
Come on.

10:22.754 --> 10:23.889
What the hell is this?

10:24.322 --> 10:26.091
Kind of reminds me
of my first wife.

10:28.092 --> 10:29.027
They are petrified.

10:29.995 --> 10:31.697
Yeah,
she got pretty fucking scary.

10:46.311 --> 10:47.846
This is amazing.

10:48.312 --> 10:49.280
I thought you'd like it.

10:52.451 --> 10:54.052
I always like to end up here.

10:55.086 --> 10:55.955
Makes sense.

10:56.956 --> 10:58.724
Sand everywhere and then
water you can't drink.

10:59.124 --> 11:01.394
Luckily for me,
I brought my own.

11:13.804 --> 11:14.839
How about that?

11:16.475 --> 11:19.245
I've been coming here for 20
years, and only found one once.

11:20.879 --> 11:21.747
Let me see it.

11:27.351 --> 11:30.822
Every once in a while,
lightning will hit these dunes,

11:32.356 --> 11:34.092
and the sand will
turn into glass.

11:34.960 --> 11:35.828
It's very rare.

11:36.761 --> 11:38.029
Only a few pieces each year.

11:39.063 --> 11:39.932
You should keep it.

11:43.134 --> 11:44.003
For luck.

11:44.903 --> 11:46.305
I was hit by lightning once.

11:46.404 --> 11:48.106
- Bullshit!
- No, it's true.

11:49.240 --> 11:50.408
My knob was electric for a week.

11:50.509 --> 11:51.342
Diane loved it.

11:55.246 --> 11:56.214
What?

11:56.315 --> 11:57.149
That was funny.

11:59.049 --> 12:02.187
Liz... loved this place
ever since she was a kid.

12:05.389 --> 12:07.158
She thinks I don't care enough.

12:10.061 --> 12:12.098
Maybe she just needs
to see you like this.

12:18.136 --> 12:19.504
- I got pitcher.
- No!

12:19.605 --> 12:21.907
- I can pitch.
- No, you can't pitch.

12:31.416 --> 12:32.752
Come on, test me.

12:33.451 --> 12:34.486
Really throw one.

12:34.586 --> 12:35.888
Get him, Jack.

12:40.558 --> 12:41.427
Come on!

12:42.494 --> 12:44.396
Throw the damn ball!
Show me what you're made of.

12:44.495 --> 12:45.798
Hit him, Jack.

12:45.898 --> 12:46.966
Show his ass.

12:55.474 --> 12:57.042
Damn!

12:58.509 --> 12:59.979
Nearly spilled my beer.

13:00.544 --> 13:02.447
That's more like it.

13:02.548 --> 13:03.948
Some fire.

13:04.048 --> 13:05.518
Yeah. Pitch them like that,

13:06.384 --> 13:08.019
just, uh, across the plate.

13:16.427 --> 13:17.529
I sold short.

13:18.964 --> 13:19.865
Made a killing.

13:20.599 --> 13:22.234
Everyone's selling short.

13:22.333 --> 13:23.835
No long-term investment.

13:23.936 --> 13:24.870
Hoping for failure.

13:26.270 --> 13:27.505
I only know how to win.

13:28.907 --> 13:30.442
Seems easier in a rigged game.

13:31.109 --> 13:33.412
Alright, what the fuck are
you guys talking about?

13:33.511 --> 13:34.345
I'm hungry.

13:42.988 --> 13:44.857
I bet you a hundred bucks
I catch something

13:44.956 --> 13:45.825
before either one of you.

13:46.991 --> 13:48.159
Jack doesn't catch fish.

13:49.394 --> 13:51.230
What exactly do you do, Jackie?

13:54.231 --> 13:55.433
I like to cast.

13:58.503 --> 14:00.038
Yeah, but why not fish?

14:00.905 --> 14:02.507
Jackie, that's the whole point,
is you catch the fish

14:02.607 --> 14:04.242
then you eat the fish
that you catch.

14:05.543 --> 14:06.879
You know, he hates that.

14:07.245 --> 14:08.113
Hates what?

14:08.947 --> 14:09.615
Jackie.

14:11.048 --> 14:12.384
He hates it when
you call him that.

14:13.684 --> 14:14.552
Sorry...

14:16.020 --> 14:16.889
Jackie.

14:17.489 --> 14:18.990
You know...

14:19.924 --> 14:21.426
...let's make it
a thousand dollars.

14:24.229 --> 14:25.865
- A thousand?
- Yeah.

14:25.965 --> 14:28.399
If there's one thing I've
learned over the past few years,

14:28.432 --> 14:30.001
sometimes you got to go all in.

14:30.936 --> 14:32.304
I have something,
you're on, deal!

14:35.472 --> 14:37.041
Damn it, aw, damn it!

14:40.211 --> 14:41.880
I mean, what can I say?

14:41.980 --> 14:43.381
I've always been a lucky guy.

14:46.650 --> 14:48.186
Yeah, you got that right.

14:49.153 --> 14:50.956
Semi-good looking from birth,

14:51.523 --> 14:54.593
born into an old money,
New England family.

14:55.259 --> 14:56.662
Of course,
pockets were kind of bare

14:56.761 --> 14:58.463
by the time they got you, huh.

15:01.166 --> 15:02.434
Alright,
you can keep the thousand,

15:02.533 --> 15:04.102
if that's what's eating you.

15:06.104 --> 15:07.605
Money's never been my problem.

15:07.706 --> 15:09.908
Know,
you were knee deep in pussy

15:10.009 --> 15:11.310
from the moment
we got to Dartmouth.

15:12.344 --> 15:14.914
And then you meet Liz,
junior year,

15:15.379 --> 15:17.149
and you swept her off her feet.

15:17.581 --> 15:20.952
Then, you know,
you had connections and money.

15:22.153 --> 15:23.288
That's my story, Moze.

15:23.687 --> 15:25.024
What's yours?

15:25.356 --> 15:26.225
Look at you.

15:27.125 --> 15:28.427
You're drunk
and embarrassing yourself,

15:28.527 --> 15:29.961
- as usual.
- Hey!

15:30.394 --> 15:31.629
Hey, hey, hey. Come on, come on.

15:32.563 --> 15:34.033
Who're you protecting?

15:34.133 --> 15:35.067
Him?

15:35.667 --> 15:37.036
He doesn't have your back.

15:38.336 --> 15:39.337
Moze...

15:39.437 --> 15:41.206
What? Ask any of his partners.

15:41.306 --> 15:43.208
No, better yet, ask Liz.

15:44.174 --> 15:45.043
Hey.

15:46.043 --> 15:47.245
You used to shine, man.

15:47.346 --> 15:49.615
What's it like not being
so shiny anymore?

15:49.715 --> 15:51.684
- What the fuck...
- Hey, hey!

15:51.783 --> 15:53.152
- What the hell, man!
- Hey, hey!

15:53.251 --> 15:54.319
He's not himself.

15:54.419 --> 15:55.687
I was joking.

15:55.788 --> 15:56.956
Huh!

15:58.389 --> 16:01.460
Jack, you know I was joking,
right? Huh?

16:02.192 --> 16:04.228
Come on, I hate...
you know how I get.

16:04.328 --> 16:05.163
I...

16:06.663 --> 16:07.566
drink...

16:09.600 --> 16:11.736
I say too much, I go too far.

16:14.304 --> 16:15.707
I'm sorry, man. Come on.

16:18.076 --> 16:19.010
Give me a hug.

16:23.615 --> 16:24.515
It's burning.

16:25.250 --> 16:27.251
Shit! Goddammit.

16:29.187 --> 16:30.589
- Fuck it!
- Yeah, fuck it.

16:30.688 --> 16:32.057
Come on, to the beach!

16:32.157 --> 16:33.091
Let's go!

17:27.545 --> 17:29.348
Well,
that was a hell of a night.

17:34.219 --> 17:35.120
Where's Moze?

17:44.561 --> 17:45.530
Moze!

17:49.200 --> 17:50.068
Moze!

17:57.307 --> 17:59.243
You know he really
has a problem, right?

18:01.378 --> 18:02.613
Irresponsible jackass.

18:04.715 --> 18:05.583
It's Moze.

18:10.255 --> 18:11.256
- Hey.
- Mm.

18:14.159 --> 18:16.295
- Hey.
- Hey, son of a bitch, what?

18:18.596 --> 18:19.464
Where am I?

18:20.465 --> 18:23.267
Believe it or not,
we were worried about you.

18:23.367 --> 18:25.169
That's because
you still love me.

18:29.240 --> 18:31.276
- What day is it?
- Sunday.

18:34.211 --> 18:35.180
I need to get home.

18:40.919 --> 18:45.224
Hey, um, I want to apologize
for being a drunken ass.

18:45.623 --> 18:47.593
I, I don't even drink
that much anymore.

18:48.726 --> 18:50.529
I just hope I didn't
say or do anything

18:50.961 --> 18:52.330
that would be unforgivable.

18:53.263 --> 18:56.400
Because you're...
you two are my oldest friends.

18:57.301 --> 19:00.171
And I'd, I'd, I'd hate
for you guys to be mad at me.

19:00.672 --> 19:01.773
It's okay, Moze.

19:01.873 --> 19:03.342
Just take care of yourself,
okay?

19:05.710 --> 19:06.577
Jack.

19:10.480 --> 19:11.482
Andy.

19:17.689 --> 19:18.724
I'm sorry.

19:18.824 --> 19:19.658
Truly.

19:20.726 --> 19:21.860
Give Diane my best.

19:22.594 --> 19:23.461
Liz too.

19:30.367 --> 19:31.403
Gentlemen!

19:32.403 --> 19:33.305
Until next time!

19:44.315 --> 19:45.551
I used to love this coffee.

19:46.851 --> 19:48.320
Free-trade, organic.

19:50.288 --> 19:51.589
Used to be the best shit.

19:53.691 --> 19:54.826
Now it's just old shit.

19:54.925 --> 19:55.927
You know what I mean?

19:57.828 --> 19:58.596
The coffee?

19:59.830 --> 20:01.399
What else would
I be talking about?

20:01.500 --> 20:02.401
Your friends.

20:02.500 --> 20:03.602
No.

20:03.701 --> 20:04.869
I'm not as smart as you.

20:05.836 --> 20:07.405
I don't talk between the lines.

20:07.506 --> 20:09.841
You know, being indirect
isn't a sign of intelligence.

20:09.941 --> 20:10.976
You know it's true.

20:11.643 --> 20:12.810
I'm more successful.

20:14.578 --> 20:15.713
But I've never been as smart.

20:15.814 --> 20:17.583
Then I should have all this...

20:18.516 --> 20:19.585
and you should have my truck.

20:19.684 --> 20:20.519
No.

20:21.385 --> 20:22.520
It's not where
you come from either.

20:22.621 --> 20:23.788
I think you're too smart.

20:24.555 --> 20:25.457
It trips you up.

20:25.557 --> 20:26.625
You overthink things.

20:27.858 --> 20:29.760
If there's grand connections
to be made, I don't see them.

20:29.861 --> 20:32.464
So, I find that nothing
really matters too much.

20:33.030 --> 20:34.799
It frees me.

20:34.900 --> 20:37.636
I know what I want,
and I take it.

20:43.741 --> 20:45.443
What's Moze's deal?

20:45.544 --> 20:46.778
You know what Moze's deal is.

20:47.345 --> 20:48.447
You see through us.

20:48.547 --> 20:49.948
You think too highly of me.

20:50.682 --> 20:52.351
Come on.

21:02.393 --> 21:04.262
Moze never had any dreams.

21:06.763 --> 21:10.635
The ones he has now...
aren't really his,

21:10.736 --> 21:11.903
they are other people's,

21:13.037 --> 21:16.607
like what he's picked up
generally from Dartmouth or...

21:18.409 --> 21:19.444
wherever he's been.

21:20.577 --> 21:21.946
You never fail to impress.

21:22.713 --> 21:24.048
You just need
someone to push you.

21:24.749 --> 21:25.983
Maybe that's your real problem.

21:26.851 --> 21:27.853
Hm.

21:46.403 --> 21:48.839
- Andy, it's Liz!
- Pick it up.

21:49.507 --> 21:50.976
Tell her I'm not around,
will you?

21:56.980 --> 21:57.848
Liz,

21:58.849 --> 21:59.717
it...

22:00.518 --> 22:01.553
it's Jack.

22:01.919 --> 22:02.788
<i>Jack?</i>

22:03.653 --> 22:04.522
Yeah.

22:05.490 --> 22:06.825
Andy, he's, uh,

22:07.424 --> 22:09.094
he's indisposed.

22:09.727 --> 22:11.697
<i>It's good to hear your voice.</i>

22:14.031 --> 22:14.865
Yeah.

22:14.965 --> 22:16.834
It's, it's, really...

22:20.438 --> 22:22.607
- I don't want to keep you, Liz.
- <i>You're not keeping me.</i>

22:22.707 --> 22:23.975
Andy will call you back.
It was really good

22:24.075 --> 22:25.544
talking to you, goodbye.

22:31.915 --> 22:33.518
Andy, I'm going for a walk!

22:34.451 --> 22:35.453
Go ahead.

22:36.520 --> 22:38.522
I'm going to shower
and take care of some work.

22:39.891 --> 22:41.393
Let's get into some
trouble tonight.

22:41.826 --> 22:42.827
I feel stir crazy.

22:42.928 --> 22:44.730
Yeah, yeah.

23:15.526 --> 23:17.395
Yeah, well,
what are you going to do?

23:17.728 --> 23:19.464
You're not going to do
a fucking thing.

23:20.064 --> 23:21.700
I got out at the right time
and you didn't,

23:21.799 --> 23:22.867
and that's all on you.

23:22.968 --> 23:24.469
We don't hold each
other's pricks.

23:25.836 --> 23:26.872
Yeah, well, fuck you too!

23:28.772 --> 23:30.007
Stupid motherfucker.

23:31.576 --> 23:32.477
Oh, hi.

23:32.910 --> 23:34.479
Did you hear that bullshit?

23:34.912 --> 23:35.846
Some.

23:35.946 --> 23:37.681
Yeah, just some investor.

23:38.682 --> 23:39.984
Blames me for having
the good judgment

23:40.085 --> 23:41.686
to dump a company
at the right time.

23:42.787 --> 23:43.822
Did you give him a heads-up?

23:44.922 --> 23:46.057
Not exactly.

23:47.791 --> 23:49.660
You can't tell
that guy anything anyway.

23:50.193 --> 23:52.029
Come on. Let's get a drink.

23:53.263 --> 23:54.131
Nice jacket.

23:54.999 --> 23:55.866
Oh, yeah?

23:56.634 --> 23:58.036
It's kind of your style.

23:58.135 --> 23:59.171
The working man's jacket.

24:00.672 --> 24:02.007
I always wanted
to be a working man.

24:02.707 --> 24:03.575
Cool clothes.

24:15.053 --> 24:15.921
Nice place, huh.

24:16.921 --> 24:17.823
Yeah.

24:18.556 --> 24:19.723
It's not much of an inn,

24:20.525 --> 24:22.461
but it has its qualities.

24:26.830 --> 24:29.700
Good beer and I like
to spend time with the locals.

24:30.701 --> 24:32.938
Yeah. Reminds me of Buffalo.

24:33.038 --> 24:34.472
Hope that doesn't
pain you too much.

24:34.573 --> 24:35.841
I like the familiarity.

24:36.540 --> 24:38.175
That is the spirit.

24:39.876 --> 24:40.744
Hi.

24:41.178 --> 24:43.181
Um, my friend wants to know,

24:43.280 --> 24:45.683
are you guys in the movies
or something?

24:45.784 --> 24:48.587
Sometimes we get Hollywood
people that stay up on the lake.

24:49.119 --> 24:52.056
As a matter of fact,
we are in the movie business.

24:52.156 --> 24:53.258
Aren't we, Jack?

24:56.126 --> 24:57.061
You're teasing.

24:57.929 --> 25:00.632
I find work so tedious.

25:03.134 --> 25:05.036
My name's Becca. This is Kate.

25:06.804 --> 25:08.940
You look younger, clean shaven.

25:09.039 --> 25:10.141
Oh, that's right.

25:10.240 --> 25:12.042
You came in the store
the other day.

25:12.676 --> 25:13.844
God, you look different.

25:14.211 --> 25:16.248
- Very handsome.
- Thanks.

25:16.913 --> 25:18.682
You've always kept secrets,
Jack.

25:22.053 --> 25:25.056
Well, at least we can
pretend we're movie stars.

25:27.959 --> 25:29.760
To movie stars.

25:35.967 --> 25:37.035
This place is beautiful.

25:37.734 --> 25:38.602
Hm.

25:39.470 --> 25:41.139
I built this place
with my own hands.

25:41.806 --> 25:44.543
Oh! A real man.

25:44.643 --> 25:45.677
- Mm-hm.
- There aren't

25:45.777 --> 25:47.144
too many of those
left these days.

25:48.011 --> 25:48.913
Jack's a carpenter.

25:49.013 --> 25:49.914
What?

25:50.714 --> 25:51.750
I don't believe you.

25:52.683 --> 25:55.287
An Ivy League
educated carpenter.

25:57.020 --> 25:58.155
Is that true?

26:01.325 --> 26:02.192
Yeah.

26:04.194 --> 26:05.262
I'm going to school.

26:06.631 --> 26:07.732
Community college.

26:09.133 --> 26:10.035
I grew up here.

26:12.002 --> 26:14.105
Always thought I'd get away,

26:14.204 --> 26:16.707
but... now I don't want to.

26:21.679 --> 26:22.681
It's a good place.

26:39.396 --> 26:40.731
So, what do you think of her?

26:42.066 --> 26:42.933
Who?

26:44.134 --> 26:45.002
Kate.

26:46.170 --> 26:47.138
She likes you.

26:48.772 --> 26:49.707
She's young.

26:49.807 --> 26:50.808
Mm.

26:50.909 --> 26:52.611
She doesn't have
any regrets yet.

26:56.814 --> 26:57.716
Hm.

26:58.749 --> 26:59.817
She's pretty.

27:00.451 --> 27:01.620
Yes,

27:02.185 --> 27:03.221
very.

27:05.855 --> 27:06.857
But we're here.

27:26.143 --> 27:27.144
Are you coming?

27:30.381 --> 27:32.384
Just a minute.

27:50.500 --> 27:51.735
Where's Becca?

27:52.368 --> 27:53.237
Hm?

28:04.347 --> 28:05.683
Can I hold your hand?

29:00.270 --> 29:01.405
We've got to go, honey.

29:02.006 --> 29:03.875
Unless you want to stay,
I've got work.

29:16.987 --> 29:18.189
Thank you.

29:41.912 --> 29:42.980
They are gone?

29:49.353 --> 29:50.922
You didn't want to say goodbye?

29:51.422 --> 29:52.524
You know how I get sometimes.

29:53.457 --> 29:54.793
I drank too much.

29:54.893 --> 29:56.361
And it seemed like a good idea.

29:57.161 --> 29:58.863
- Liz and I...
- I don't judge.

29:59.329 --> 30:00.197
Yes, you do.

30:00.865 --> 30:01.833
We all do.

30:02.333 --> 30:04.169
Can we just let this go?

30:04.602 --> 30:06.571
You're here,
this is your last day.

30:06.671 --> 30:08.472
Come on, let's have some fun.

30:09.173 --> 30:11.175
A little more reminiscing,
a little more forgetting

30:11.276 --> 30:12.911
about the future, huh?

30:14.912 --> 30:16.914
- Come on, man.
- Stop, stop.

30:21.585 --> 30:22.452
Fine.

30:49.212 --> 30:50.414
I've seen you like this before.

30:51.582 --> 30:53.017
Back in college.

30:53.116 --> 30:54.251
In this exact position.

30:55.318 --> 30:56.520
Staring at your hands

30:56.621 --> 30:57.956
and thinking about something,

30:58.056 --> 30:59.123
probably important.

30:59.690 --> 31:01.558
What question can
our hands answer?

31:02.192 --> 31:03.193
I'm not sure.

31:11.335 --> 31:12.303
I envy your hands.

31:14.137 --> 31:16.540
Being envious is an ugly
quality, don't you think?

31:17.574 --> 31:18.877
Never satisfied.

31:18.977 --> 31:19.644
Never happy.

31:20.277 --> 31:21.379
It makes me stupid.

31:23.614 --> 31:25.016
I make dumb choices.

31:27.584 --> 31:30.020
And I don't appreciate what
I have right in front of me.

31:33.624 --> 31:34.491
Let me see.

31:40.230 --> 31:41.098
Well-worked.

31:42.232 --> 31:44.201
It looks like you actually
built something with them.

31:46.170 --> 31:48.139
I built an investment
portfolio with mine,

31:48.239 --> 31:49.973
but it doesn't feel the same.

31:52.076 --> 31:54.144
My hands never made
any damn sense to me.

31:55.346 --> 31:58.016
No matter how much
I work with them,

31:59.048 --> 32:01.152
they never grow
as calloused as my father's.

32:04.520 --> 32:05.956
Why work for other people?

32:06.623 --> 32:08.459
You should have your own
construction company.

32:09.093 --> 32:09.961
Yeah.

32:10.994 --> 32:12.429
My sort of people don't do that.

32:14.064 --> 32:16.034
You never had a sort of people,
Jack.

32:17.233 --> 32:18.468
You've never wanted
to lose your family,

32:18.568 --> 32:20.137
but they are already gone.

32:21.171 --> 32:23.074
You surpassed them
when you were born.

32:23.173 --> 32:24.308
That's what they wanted for you.

32:30.180 --> 32:31.048
Stop.

32:32.715 --> 32:33.984
This how it is now?

32:37.186 --> 32:38.488
You'll never catch me!

33:01.545 --> 33:03.281
- Ha!
- Jesus Christ!

33:05.750 --> 33:07.218
You should see your face.

33:08.652 --> 33:10.020
What kind of move was that?

33:11.355 --> 33:12.323
Sneak Attack.

33:14.324 --> 33:16.094
Yeah, sure thing, buddy.

33:16.193 --> 33:17.228
Yeah, yeah, sure thing.

33:17.760 --> 33:18.695
I can use that.

33:19.563 --> 33:22.233
You know, the trail...
it's up there.

33:27.403 --> 33:30.008
Now remember, I always win.

33:35.378 --> 33:37.180
Congratulations
on being an asshole.

33:46.390 --> 33:47.358
What's wrong?

33:49.460 --> 33:50.495
It's good times, man.

33:50.595 --> 33:51.496
Don't touch me.

34:23.360 --> 34:24.393
You're not eating.

34:49.152 --> 34:50.087
How is it?

34:53.257 --> 34:54.125
Good.

34:59.429 --> 35:00.597
Ah!

35:02.798 --> 35:04.501
We're getting soft.

35:04.601 --> 35:06.436
Speak for yourself.

35:06.536 --> 35:08.472
I can do 100 pushups right now.

35:10.574 --> 35:11.608
Can you?

35:15.811 --> 35:17.514
- Don't want to.
- Come on.

35:18.382 --> 35:19.750
Get over here
and do pushups with me.

35:22.619 --> 35:23.721
You don't think you can.

35:24.288 --> 35:25.322
No.

35:25.722 --> 35:27.191
You're being absurd.

35:27.291 --> 35:28.226
Oh, God, it's hot.

35:31.894 --> 35:33.163
You'll be cold in a minute.

35:33.264 --> 35:34.132
What?

35:35.199 --> 35:36.867
You can see
into the future now too?

35:38.869 --> 35:41.405
What? Just say it.

35:41.505 --> 35:42.640
You're always holding back.

35:42.739 --> 35:43.840
Holding your tongue.

35:43.940 --> 35:45.475
I was only concerned.

35:45.576 --> 35:46.811
No, you were disapproving.

35:46.911 --> 35:48.378
And that's different.

35:51.248 --> 35:51.916
Never mind.

35:54.251 --> 35:57.321
I don't want to argue...
on your last night here.

35:59.289 --> 36:00.858
This is your last night,
isn't it?

36:02.793 --> 36:04.495
- It can be.
- That's right.

36:05.295 --> 36:06.630
You have a flexible schedule.

36:07.965 --> 36:09.200
Why is that, Jack?

36:12.001 --> 36:13.403
Yeah, go into that bottle.

36:13.503 --> 36:14.471
That'll save you.

36:16.340 --> 36:17.875
Do you really want to be honest,
Andy?

36:18.875 --> 36:19.809
Why not?

36:20.943 --> 36:22.279
I've got nothing going on.

36:22.679 --> 36:24.215
How's your job going?

36:25.715 --> 36:26.683
Big deals, huh?

36:27.617 --> 36:28.920
Real big deals.

36:29.019 --> 36:32.789
You're...
you're a real great businessman.

36:34.023 --> 36:35.458
You're a real great guy.

36:40.429 --> 36:41.898
I got fired from my last job.

36:43.300 --> 36:44.202
How come?

36:44.867 --> 36:45.835
Hit my boss.

36:47.271 --> 36:48.272
That'll do it.

36:49.273 --> 36:51.342
He said something
about this woman at work.

36:52.708 --> 36:53.610
What did he say?

36:57.914 --> 36:58.916
It's not important.

36:59.983 --> 37:02.385
Everything is a riddle with you,
man.

37:03.387 --> 37:04.755
Jesus, you're exhausting.

37:05.521 --> 37:06.990
You know, Liz agrees with me,
I think.

37:07.090 --> 37:07.991
You're tiring.

37:08.592 --> 37:09.527
I'm tired of you.

37:10.626 --> 37:12.329
Maybe you should go back.

37:12.429 --> 37:14.231
To wherever it is
the fuck you call home.

37:14.764 --> 37:16.333
Sounds like a good idea.

37:16.434 --> 37:17.401
You know what?

37:18.402 --> 37:21.905
To think of what your life
could've been like

37:22.606 --> 37:23.941
if Liz had chosen you.

37:25.442 --> 37:27.677
I can almost picture it.

37:29.413 --> 37:30.947
I doubt you could've kept her,
though.

37:31.047 --> 37:32.949
You think she didn't choose you

37:33.550 --> 37:34.785
because you're not good enough.

37:35.418 --> 37:36.753
She didn't choose you
because you don't know

37:36.853 --> 37:37.855
who the fuck you are.

37:40.724 --> 37:41.592
What?

37:42.525 --> 37:44.461
You want to hit me, huh?

37:44.561 --> 37:46.264
You want to hit me, Jackie?

37:47.431 --> 37:48.599
You're a child, Andy.

37:50.599 --> 37:52.869
You've always been a child
looking for new toys.

37:52.969 --> 37:54.871
No, you want
to have what I have.

37:56.373 --> 37:57.407
You want to be me.

37:58.608 --> 37:59.844
I pity you.

37:59.943 --> 38:01.545
I feel bad for Liz.

38:02.878 --> 38:04.014
She's too good for you.

38:04.114 --> 38:05.548
No.

38:05.648 --> 38:07.684
Keep putting her
on that pedestal, pal.

38:07.784 --> 38:08.918
She's no saint.

38:09.485 --> 38:10.353
She's like me.

38:11.454 --> 38:12.757
We're both whores.

38:21.431 --> 38:22.500
Fuck you, Andy.

38:26.902 --> 38:28.505
Don't you fucking
walk away from me.

38:29.106 --> 38:30.341
You fucking coward!

38:33.777 --> 38:35.413
Fuck you, Jack.
You're supposed to...

38:36.480 --> 38:37.882
Stop it! Stop it.

38:39.483 --> 38:40.318
Stop!

39:02.505 --> 39:03.440
Andy?

39:18.054 --> 39:19.724
Oh, my God.

39:25.195 --> 39:26.697
I'm so sorry.

39:26.797 --> 39:27.865
It's going to be okay.

39:34.704 --> 39:37.074
I don't understand,
I don't understand.

39:58.695 --> 39:59.563
<i>Hello.</i>

40:00.664 --> 40:01.532
<i>Andy.</i>

40:02.632 --> 40:03.501
<i>Hello.</i>

41:42.998 --> 41:44.634
Cleaning off the beach,
huh?

41:51.173 --> 41:52.775
That's right.

41:57.981 --> 41:59.550
That's very nice of you.

41:59.650 --> 42:00.885
God's work really.

42:01.284 --> 42:02.853
You're a friend of Andy's?

42:04.621 --> 42:06.891
- Yes.
- Oh! Is he around?

42:08.757 --> 42:11.261
- Huh?
- Is Andy up at the cottage?

42:13.262 --> 42:16.266
No. He, uh... he left.

42:17.766 --> 42:19.235
Oh! Well, I'm Bob.

42:19.335 --> 42:21.704
I'm president of the cottage
association here.

42:21.804 --> 42:22.772
Welcome.

42:24.773 --> 42:27.010
You don't kitesurf, do you?

42:27.110 --> 42:29.145
A few of us get together
from time to time.

42:30.981 --> 42:32.917
- What?
- Kitesurf.

42:33.349 --> 42:36.152
You know, you,
you surf with a kite.

42:36.253 --> 42:37.221
No.

42:37.320 --> 42:38.655
I don't, I don't do that.

42:38.989 --> 42:39.856
Uh, too bad.

42:41.090 --> 42:43.760
Yeah, this dune grass ate up
a kite of mine the other day.

42:44.994 --> 42:47.197
But I have a few,
if you ever want to borrow one.

42:48.231 --> 42:49.099
Okay.

42:50.099 --> 42:51.735
Thanks again for the work
you're doing here.

42:51.835 --> 42:53.836
- The association appreciates it.
- Sure.

42:55.271 --> 42:56.606
Good day to you.

42:57.641 --> 42:58.608
Nice to meet you.

43:39.215 --> 43:40.049
Come on.

44:30.733 --> 44:31.402
Shit.

46:27.951 --> 46:29.019
Who's there?

46:38.494 --> 46:39.863
Hi, Jack.

46:44.300 --> 46:45.269
It's been a long time.

46:48.204 --> 46:50.274
I had to come up here
and see for myself.

46:52.141 --> 46:54.478
He was never here, was he?

46:54.577 --> 46:55.445
He's with her.

46:55.545 --> 46:56.547
Who?

46:57.413 --> 46:58.981
With a woman he's been seeing.

46:59.081 --> 46:59.982
I don't know her name.

47:00.083 --> 47:01.485
No, he was, um, he was here.

47:01.585 --> 47:03.019
He, he left last night.

47:04.219 --> 47:05.454
You don't have to lie for him.

47:05.554 --> 47:07.089
I'm not. No, Liz, I'm not.

47:07.190 --> 47:08.458
Then he left to be with her?

47:10.326 --> 47:12.161
I don't, I don't know
anything about that.

47:12.628 --> 47:15.833
He just said he had to go to...
Grand Rapids...

47:16.599 --> 47:17.467
some business.

47:19.501 --> 47:21.438
He didn't have to go
anywhere for business.

47:23.106 --> 47:24.842
Promise me
you're telling the truth.

47:25.307 --> 47:26.943
I don't know anything about it,
Liz.

47:27.510 --> 47:28.378
I swear.

47:43.425 --> 47:44.594
I, uh...

47:45.594 --> 47:47.463
You know, I should,
I should get going.

47:48.197 --> 47:49.599
I haven't seen you in so long,
and you're already

47:49.699 --> 47:51.134
planning your escape?

47:52.568 --> 47:54.204
Am I really that
awful to be around?

47:55.170 --> 47:56.306
You don't have to answer that.

48:03.079 --> 48:05.282
I'm a mess.
I wouldn't want anybody

48:05.382 --> 48:07.483
to just see me like this,
especially you.

48:10.420 --> 48:12.155
I'm going on about myself.

48:13.021 --> 48:14.625
I guess that was
always the problem.

48:14.724 --> 48:15.893
What about you?

48:17.059 --> 48:17.994
What are you up to?

48:18.094 --> 48:19.896
Do you have someone?

48:22.565 --> 48:23.432
No.

48:24.733 --> 48:26.502
I haven't seen you in,
what?

48:27.103 --> 48:28.137
Five years.

48:33.543 --> 48:34.577
Say something, Jack.

48:36.512 --> 48:37.547
Oh, uh...

48:38.614 --> 48:39.682
I don't know what to say.

48:40.682 --> 48:41.985
Just want to know how you are.

48:43.452 --> 48:44.454
Where do you live?

48:45.021 --> 48:46.456
How's construction?

48:47.190 --> 48:48.057
Too many questions?

48:48.157 --> 48:48.991
Pick one.

48:50.126 --> 48:50.994
Uh...

48:51.661 --> 48:53.130
I haven't been too successful.

48:53.528 --> 48:54.431
Who has?

48:55.097 --> 48:56.233
Look at me. I'm a...

48:57.065 --> 48:58.401
painter who rarely paints,

48:58.501 --> 49:00.570
and when I do, no one cares.

49:04.407 --> 49:05.943
You're a wonderful painter.

49:06.043 --> 49:07.711
You haven't seen my recent work.

49:08.378 --> 49:10.080
I've seen enough. You don't,

49:10.179 --> 49:11.714
you don't lose
a talent like that.

49:13.248 --> 49:14.951
And then there's my husband...

49:19.454 --> 49:21.190
I'm going to fix
this before I go.

49:27.463 --> 49:29.199
Are you thirsty? I'm thirsty.

49:36.204 --> 49:38.574
Andy hates the well water,
but I prefer it.

49:42.144 --> 49:43.612
Kind of sums it all up, I guess.

49:43.713 --> 49:44.548
Doesn't it?

49:47.384 --> 49:48.552
No!

49:49.217 --> 49:50.186
What?

49:50.286 --> 49:51.420
You can't drink the water.

49:52.221 --> 49:54.423
I'm sorry, I forgot.
I forgot in catching up.

49:55.123 --> 49:58.094
Um, the water
has bacteria in it.

49:58.693 --> 50:00.998
Yeah. You can't drink it
until it's treated.

50:01.097 --> 50:03.266
Andy had a guy, um, come over,

50:03.365 --> 50:04.701
just before Moze and I arrived.

50:08.271 --> 50:09.740
How can that even happen?

50:10.405 --> 50:11.407
I don't know.

50:11.507 --> 50:13.409
Andy, um,

50:13.510 --> 50:16.413
Andy said that the well cover
was off when he arrived.

50:16.512 --> 50:18.280
He didn't know why, you know?

50:18.681 --> 50:20.050
Blamed the maintenance guy.

50:20.449 --> 50:22.385
Um, and he said that something,

50:22.485 --> 50:25.721
you know, like a snake
or a rat got in there and, uh...

50:27.789 --> 50:28.791
died.

50:30.358 --> 50:31.527
Disgusting.

50:33.829 --> 50:35.297
How do you get rid of it?

50:37.833 --> 50:38.701
Bleach.

50:39.869 --> 50:41.438
You pour a lot of bleach.

50:44.474 --> 50:47.443
Did Andy take care
of the bleach before he left?

50:48.443 --> 50:51.480
I don't, uh, I don't think so.

50:52.715 --> 50:55.218
Well, then I'll have
to take care of that.

50:55.318 --> 50:56.186
No, no, no, no.

50:56.286 --> 50:57.354
Uh...

50:58.320 --> 50:59.188
I'll do it.

51:01.456 --> 51:03.125
I think there's
some in the shed.

51:04.860 --> 51:05.728
Okay.

51:06.394 --> 51:07.329
I got it.

51:32.320 --> 51:34.824
I don't know how you guys
survived two days together.

51:36.224 --> 51:37.193
Sorry?

51:37.293 --> 51:38.728
There's no food in the fridge.

51:41.230 --> 51:42.632
We must have eaten it all.

51:43.398 --> 51:44.333
Uh-huh.

51:44.434 --> 51:45.569
More like, drank everything

51:45.668 --> 51:46.702
and forgot to eat.

51:46.802 --> 51:48.505
Men!

51:49.237 --> 51:50.139
That's right.

51:50.974 --> 51:51.842
I'm going to get us
some groceries.

51:52.708 --> 51:53.375
Oh, no, you don't,
you don't have to.

51:53.742 --> 51:54.311
I want to.

51:54.878 --> 51:55.745
Let me make you a meal

51:56.711 --> 51:57.713
in appreciation
for everything you've done.

53:45.521 --> 53:46.423
Becca!

54:18.353 --> 54:19.521
Find what you're looking for?

54:20.989 --> 54:22.258
Yes, thank you.

55:01.630 --> 55:02.832
Thank you.

55:04.467 --> 55:05.769
Don't I know you?

55:05.869 --> 55:06.603
You look familiar.

55:07.769 --> 55:09.438
Maybe we've seen
each other around.

55:10.039 --> 55:11.708
I've come up here
summers my whole life.

55:13.074 --> 55:15.678
You live over by Ottawa Trail,
don't you?

55:15.778 --> 55:16.980
I have friends
who live over there.

55:17.545 --> 55:18.647
That's right.

55:18.748 --> 55:19.382
Hm.

55:19.914 --> 55:22.851
Oh, your husband's Andy, right?

55:24.552 --> 55:25.487
You know Andy?

55:25.588 --> 55:27.990
We met him, uh, over at the inn.

55:28.090 --> 55:29.558
That's how I recognize you.

55:31.159 --> 55:32.428
Both of you met him?

55:33.429 --> 55:34.864
Oh, we just had
a few drinks together.

55:36.565 --> 55:37.701
He talked a lot about you.

55:38.400 --> 55:39.868
Got out pictures
of you and everything.

55:43.005 --> 55:44.340
That sounds like Andy.

55:44.873 --> 55:47.443
That'll be, uh, $47.98.

55:58.054 --> 56:00.423
Thank you for coming
to the Stony Lake Store.

56:00.523 --> 56:01.458
Have a great day.

56:03.458 --> 56:04.126
Thank you.

56:13.869 --> 56:14.971
That was cruel.

58:21.230 --> 58:22.764
Let me help you
with that.

58:25.568 --> 58:26.236
How did it go?

58:27.702 --> 58:28.605
Took care of it.

58:30.039 --> 58:32.976
I, uh, I had to get down in there.

58:34.208 --> 58:35.677
I'll go start dinner.

58:35.777 --> 58:36.712
That sounds nice.

59:41.043 --> 59:42.311
You look refreshed.

59:43.778 --> 59:45.213
Almost like back in college.

59:49.418 --> 59:50.286
Sure.

59:52.655 --> 59:54.923
We were supposed to end up
at that party that night,

59:55.023 --> 59:56.358
but we never made it.

59:57.925 --> 59:59.929
We just sat in the park
and you held me.

01:00:00.896 --> 01:00:02.332
I remember you were
still shaking.

01:00:03.766 --> 01:00:05.201
We missed the deck fall down.

01:00:06.335 --> 01:00:08.304
That's right.

01:00:08.403 --> 01:00:10.672
I guess the whole world
was shaking that night.

01:00:13.876 --> 01:00:16.079
You were my protector,
but you never made a move.

01:00:18.880 --> 01:00:20.750
Yeah. It didn't feel right.

01:00:22.751 --> 01:00:24.153
Everything could have changed.

01:00:27.389 --> 01:00:28.257
Maybe it did.

01:00:46.775 --> 01:00:47.876
I'm okay.

01:00:47.976 --> 01:00:49.344
You're cold, take it.

01:00:51.012 --> 01:00:51.980
Andy won't mind.

01:00:53.981 --> 01:00:56.018
He doesn't really care
about any of his things here.

01:00:58.786 --> 01:00:59.655
That's not true.

01:01:00.956 --> 01:01:02.358
You've seen how he is.

01:01:05.193 --> 01:01:07.163
He had some girls
over here the other night.

01:01:11.733 --> 01:01:13.036
I met them at the store.

01:01:13.501 --> 01:01:14.369
They are young.

01:01:16.105 --> 01:01:17.005
It's overrated.

01:01:18.239 --> 01:01:19.174
What is?

01:01:21.043 --> 01:01:22.111
Being young.

01:01:23.378 --> 01:01:24.447
So, is getting older.

01:01:34.722 --> 01:01:36.391
That always looked
ridiculous on Andy.

01:01:38.827 --> 01:01:39.829
Looks better on you.

01:01:40.963 --> 01:01:41.831
Thanks.

01:01:42.431 --> 01:01:43.699
It's not that bad.

01:01:48.403 --> 01:01:52.340
It's too late,
and we've had too much to drink.

01:01:54.009 --> 01:01:55.711
You have to spend the night.

01:02:05.820 --> 01:02:08.891
I'll fix that thing
before I leave tomorrow.

01:02:10.159 --> 01:02:12.295
Yes, that's a great idea.

01:02:14.096 --> 01:02:17.266
I think we should fix our
whole lives before you leave.

01:02:17.865 --> 01:02:19.768
I don't think they taught us
that in school.

01:02:20.101 --> 01:02:21.837
School sold dreams.

01:02:22.436 --> 01:02:24.740
Yeah. I didn't fit in then.

01:02:25.541 --> 01:02:26.409
School's out.

01:02:31.246 --> 01:02:32.481
I don't fit in now.

01:02:34.016 --> 01:02:36.018
That's the thing
you never realized.

01:02:37.952 --> 01:02:39.521
You thought
you were the only one.

01:02:42.858 --> 01:02:43.993
None of us fit in.

01:02:46.061 --> 01:02:47.230
Not one of us, ever.

01:02:49.197 --> 01:02:51.400
And I don't just mean
the people from school.

01:02:52.201 --> 01:02:53.369
I mean, no one.

01:02:54.869 --> 01:02:57.239
Not a single person
in the entire world.

01:03:08.382 --> 01:03:10.085
Listen to me.

01:03:10.186 --> 01:03:11.454
I've had too much to drink.

01:03:13.021 --> 01:03:14.056
I should get to bed.

01:03:19.927 --> 01:03:21.263
Don't sleep in the basement.

01:03:22.331 --> 01:03:23.199
Take this room.

01:03:24.065 --> 01:03:25.100
Bed's more comfortable.

01:03:27.202 --> 01:03:28.437
I like knowing you're nearby.

01:05:43.005 --> 01:05:44.573
Oh, my God.

01:05:47.608 --> 01:05:49.177
I thought I heard someone.

01:05:50.012 --> 01:05:52.048
We're safe here, Jack.

01:05:52.681 --> 01:05:53.548
I...

01:05:56.451 --> 01:05:58.586
I don't know
what I was thinking.

01:05:58.686 --> 01:05:59.621
It's okay.

01:06:00.155 --> 01:06:01.490
Let's go back to bed.

01:06:01.590 --> 01:06:02.425
Okay.

01:06:24.813 --> 01:06:25.681
Morning.

01:06:25.780 --> 01:06:27.282
Ah! Dammit.

01:06:28.617 --> 01:06:30.987
Funny, huh?

01:06:31.086 --> 01:06:32.722
Yep. And last night.

01:06:35.690 --> 01:06:36.559
Okay.

01:06:38.393 --> 01:06:39.295
You ready?

01:06:42.197 --> 01:06:43.298
Fixed.

01:06:47.268 --> 01:06:48.169
Almost.

01:06:51.706 --> 01:06:54.343
I should, uh,
I should really get going.

01:06:56.677 --> 01:06:57.779
Just one more day?

01:07:00.681 --> 01:07:02.717
I'm not ready to get back
to the real world yet.

01:07:08.123 --> 01:07:09.224
Okay.

01:07:09.557 --> 01:07:11.092
I'll fix the sink though.

01:07:21.268 --> 01:07:22.504
<i>Damn it!</i>

01:08:14.722 --> 01:08:15.623
Okay.

01:08:16.457 --> 01:08:17.358
You sure?

01:08:20.529 --> 01:08:21.831
Hm-mm.

01:08:22.662 --> 01:08:24.166
You are a mess.

01:08:24.265 --> 01:08:25.265
Yeah, I know.

01:08:26.734 --> 01:08:28.237
I've already thrown
your laundry in.

01:08:28.337 --> 01:08:29.171
I hope you don't mind.

01:08:29.270 --> 01:08:30.270
Had to be done.

01:08:31.337 --> 01:08:33.207
Get out of those clothes,
I'll throw them in too.

01:08:34.908 --> 01:08:36.243
What'll I wear?

01:08:37.345 --> 01:08:39.180
Just go upstairs and borrow
some of Andy's things.

01:08:41.615 --> 01:08:42.484
Okay.

01:10:40.435 --> 01:10:41.337
Well?

01:10:44.506 --> 01:10:46.342
Definitely not your style.

01:10:46.774 --> 01:10:47.643
Really?

01:10:48.376 --> 01:10:49.811
I thought I was pulling it off.

01:10:51.046 --> 01:10:52.847
I didn't say you weren't
pulling it off.

01:11:02.323 --> 01:11:03.291
See that place?

01:11:03.792 --> 01:11:04.760
Looks like a castle.

01:11:05.961 --> 01:11:08.597
I used to make up stories
about the people living there.

01:11:09.698 --> 01:11:12.568
Drew pictures of them
going about their lives.

01:11:14.336 --> 01:11:15.637
My mother thought
I'd gone crazy.

01:11:18.073 --> 01:11:19.742
It's funny, we see people

01:11:19.841 --> 01:11:21.542
and we think we know
everything about them.

01:11:21.643 --> 01:11:23.912
I never even saw
the inside of that house.

01:11:25.079 --> 01:11:26.481
It's more fun that way.

01:11:27.414 --> 01:11:28.283
Mm.

01:11:30.351 --> 01:11:31.586
You ever wish you had a family?

01:11:33.755 --> 01:11:35.024
I haven't really
thought about it.

01:11:35.823 --> 01:11:36.924
I don't believe that.

01:11:38.726 --> 01:11:40.028
I think you'd make
a great father.

01:11:42.497 --> 01:11:43.532
Why?

01:11:45.466 --> 01:11:46.467
You're loyal.

01:12:11.926 --> 01:12:14.396
- Hey, Andy, Liz.
- Come on in, Bob.

01:12:17.532 --> 01:12:18.934
Cleaning up the beach,
huh?

01:12:22.036 --> 01:12:23.905
Oh, uh, I'm, I'm sorry.

01:12:24.006 --> 01:12:25.641
I thought you were Andy.

01:12:26.908 --> 01:12:28.410
You look just like him.

01:12:29.811 --> 01:12:30.845
Jack, right?

01:12:32.680 --> 01:12:33.948
It's good to see you again.

01:12:36.951 --> 01:12:38.787
I, uh,
I saw your car out front, Liz,

01:12:38.886 --> 01:12:40.488
and thought I'd stop in
to say hello.

01:12:40.588 --> 01:12:42.423
And, uh, thought I'd see if Andy

01:12:42.524 --> 01:12:44.360
wanted to come out
kitesurfing with the crew.

01:12:45.426 --> 01:12:46.094
Is he back?

01:12:46.761 --> 01:12:47.629
No.

01:12:47.729 --> 01:12:49.431
Oh, that's strange.

01:12:49.530 --> 01:12:50.998
I, I thought I saw him
driving away

01:12:51.099 --> 01:12:53.001
after you and I talked, Jack.

01:13:02.710 --> 01:13:04.579
Yeah, who knows.
Everyone has

01:13:04.680 --> 01:13:05.981
SUVs these days.

01:13:06.713 --> 01:13:07.615
It's great marketing.

01:13:08.550 --> 01:13:09.885
They, uh,
they all look the same though.

01:13:12.086 --> 01:13:14.490
I haven't been sleeping
much on account of my back,

01:13:14.590 --> 01:13:17.126
so I've been taking long walks
on the beach in the morning.

01:13:17.926 --> 01:13:19.828
This kitesurfing
is killing me...

01:13:19.927 --> 01:13:21.430
...but I just can't give it up.

01:13:21.930 --> 01:13:22.998
You know how that goes.

01:13:25.600 --> 01:13:27.836
And I thought Andy might've
come back with you, Liz.

01:13:29.637 --> 01:13:30.506
That's too bad.

01:13:31.672 --> 01:13:33.708
Now, you're sure you don't
want to take up kitesurfing?

01:13:33.809 --> 01:13:34.810
I've got the spare kite.

01:13:36.810 --> 01:13:37.845
That's nice of you.

01:13:39.012 --> 01:13:40.615
I'll be going pretty soon.

01:13:42.817 --> 01:13:44.685
Well,
when you come back sometime.

01:13:45.086 --> 01:13:47.523
A friend of Andy and Liz
is a friend of mine.

01:13:48.555 --> 01:13:49.590
Well, I'd better get going.

01:13:49.923 --> 01:13:50.893
Fare thee well.

01:13:50.993 --> 01:13:52.060
I'll see you around.

01:13:52.760 --> 01:13:55.697
And, uh...
give my best to Andy too.

01:14:03.238 --> 01:14:05.641
You said Andy left
the night before.

01:14:07.708 --> 01:14:08.943
You were covering for him.

01:14:10.011 --> 01:14:12.147
He was here until right
before I arrived.

01:14:14.282 --> 01:14:16.985
I'm sorry, Liz. I,
I should have been honest.

01:14:17.085 --> 01:14:18.220
No, I'm sorry.

01:14:19.753 --> 01:14:21.722
It seems I can't trust
any of my friends.

01:15:15.577 --> 01:15:17.546
- Wait...
- Yeah.

01:15:17.645 --> 01:15:18.512
From the store, I know.

01:15:19.247 --> 01:15:21.650
I work a couple jobs
to pay for college.

01:15:23.016 --> 01:15:23.885
Good for you.

01:15:25.185 --> 01:15:26.621
Are you closing soon?

01:15:27.154 --> 01:15:28.823
Uh, we're slow today.

01:15:30.190 --> 01:15:31.292
What can I get you?

01:15:33.060 --> 01:15:34.195
Something different.

01:16:13.201 --> 01:16:14.168
This is sweet.

01:16:15.002 --> 01:16:15.871
Too much?

01:16:16.270 --> 01:16:17.139
No.

01:16:20.975 --> 01:16:22.044
Can you sit with me?

01:16:22.676 --> 01:16:23.744
I don't like to sit alone.

01:16:24.712 --> 01:16:26.114
- Oh.
- I'm asking too much.

01:16:27.414 --> 01:16:28.684
I can, for a minute.

01:16:32.987 --> 01:16:34.989
You have a nice way about you.

01:16:39.193 --> 01:16:40.662
Are you going to be okay?

01:16:44.364 --> 01:16:45.967
It never gets easier, you know.

01:16:47.702 --> 01:16:48.670
But I'll be all right.

01:16:49.337 --> 01:16:50.305
We figure it out.

01:17:05.787 --> 01:17:06.655
Jack?

01:18:19.527 --> 01:18:21.029
<i>We need to talk, Andy.</i>

01:18:21.462 --> 01:18:22.330
<i>Call me.</i>

01:18:29.936 --> 01:18:30.805
Huh!

01:19:17.318 --> 01:19:18.820
I was worried about you.

01:19:29.329 --> 01:19:30.398
I went for a walk.

01:19:33.333 --> 01:19:35.036
Did you figure everything out?

01:19:37.371 --> 01:19:38.273
What do you mean?

01:19:40.942 --> 01:19:43.177
Long walks are
for sorting things out.

01:19:43.845 --> 01:19:45.247
I rarely take them anymore.

01:19:45.846 --> 01:19:46.981
Then you have to do something.

01:19:49.617 --> 01:19:51.787
I don't want to lose him, Jack,
because...

01:19:53.854 --> 01:19:56.056
then I'd really have
to face myself.

01:19:56.623 --> 01:19:59.327
I've made a mess of everything.

01:20:00.595 --> 01:20:01.997
You haven't.

01:20:12.573 --> 01:20:13.441
It's rare.

01:20:15.141 --> 01:20:16.010
Like...

01:20:17.645 --> 01:20:19.381
a chance to change your life.

01:20:21.649 --> 01:20:23.318
We only get a few of those.

01:20:38.099 --> 01:20:40.101
I have to leave
in the morning for work.

01:20:43.237 --> 01:20:44.139
Of course you do.

01:20:46.172 --> 01:20:47.175
We have to get back.

01:21:21.274 --> 01:21:22.143
Jack?

01:21:34.521 --> 01:21:35.422
What do you want?

01:21:37.024 --> 01:21:38.126
You have to tell me.

01:21:44.698 --> 01:21:45.567
You.

01:21:49.569 --> 01:21:50.471
Come here.

01:22:13.728 --> 01:22:17.465
I want to make sure this is
really okay for the both of us.

01:22:19.766 --> 01:22:21.202
My marriage is over.

01:22:22.636 --> 01:22:24.639
I don't feel
like I owe Andy anything.

01:22:24.738 --> 01:22:25.572
Do you?

01:22:29.443 --> 01:22:30.311
No.

01:22:35.649 --> 01:22:37.018
This is just a night.

01:22:39.420 --> 01:22:40.288
It means,

01:22:41.154 --> 01:22:42.023
care.

01:22:43.189 --> 01:22:44.091
That's all.

01:22:45.760 --> 01:22:47.162
I understand.

01:24:01.668 --> 01:24:03.371
Are you okay?

01:24:06.573 --> 01:24:07.641
I can't breathe.

01:24:07.742 --> 01:24:08.576
Jack!

01:25:07.301 --> 01:25:09.104
Why did you bother coming back?

01:25:09.636 --> 01:25:10.572
I had to see you.

01:25:13.306 --> 01:25:14.175
That's not true.

01:25:14.274 --> 01:25:15.210
I came back

01:25:15.310 --> 01:25:16.277
to make things right.

01:25:16.377 --> 01:25:17.345
You left because

01:25:17.444 --> 01:25:18.779
you don't trust anyone.

01:25:19.613 --> 01:25:22.182
You came back because
you don't know what you want

01:25:22.283 --> 01:25:23.118
or who you are.

01:25:26.287 --> 01:25:27.155
Now you know.

01:25:29.323 --> 01:25:30.191
That's right.

01:25:34.828 --> 01:25:36.564
Andy's honest in a way.

01:25:38.298 --> 01:25:39.801
He has an appetite
for possessions.

01:25:39.900 --> 01:25:41.435
He never denies it.

01:25:41.536 --> 01:25:42.604
But you...

01:25:43.770 --> 01:25:45.606
you've been pretending all
these years to be different.

01:25:47.408 --> 01:25:48.676
All Andy's clothes.

01:25:49.976 --> 01:25:51.479
All Andy's things.

01:25:52.378 --> 01:25:53.715
Even Andy's wife.

01:25:54.448 --> 01:25:55.750
I finally see you now.

01:25:56.350 --> 01:25:59.220
You're empty inside,
and all these years you thought

01:25:59.319 --> 01:26:01.255
being Andy would complete you.

01:26:01.355 --> 01:26:02.356
Stop, stop it!

01:26:02.457 --> 01:26:03.691
Just, I'm sorry.

01:26:03.791 --> 01:26:04.759
I'm so sorry.

01:26:04.859 --> 01:26:06.227
I didn't mean to do that.

01:26:07.728 --> 01:26:09.430
I've never thought
of you that way.

01:26:12.265 --> 01:26:13.300
I feel like a fool.

01:26:15.502 --> 01:26:17.505
To think that there could have
been something real between us.

01:26:18.639 --> 01:26:19.774
What about you, Liz?

01:26:20.807 --> 01:26:22.877
- Tell me.
- You don't want to know the truth.

01:26:23.577 --> 01:26:25.313
- Nobody does.
- Say it!

01:26:25.412 --> 01:26:26.580
You liked the attention.

01:26:26.680 --> 01:26:28.282
Made you feel good,
it's turned you on.

01:26:28.748 --> 01:26:29.951
It allowed you
not to look inward.

01:26:31.417 --> 01:26:32.686
That's what's important.
That's something that

01:26:32.787 --> 01:26:34.389
I know about myself.

01:26:34.488 --> 01:26:37.759
That's something that I know...
about people.

01:26:37.859 --> 01:26:40.695
No, most people aren't like you,
Jack.

01:26:41.828 --> 01:26:43.497
I am not afraid
to look at myself.

01:26:43.597 --> 01:26:44.431
Not anymore.

01:26:47.868 --> 01:26:48.736
You should leave.

01:26:53.373 --> 01:26:54.242
Where's Andy?

01:26:57.978 --> 01:26:58.846
Where is he?

01:27:00.447 --> 01:27:01.815
You've all the answers, Liz.

01:27:03.050 --> 01:27:04.418
I don't know.

01:31:02.088 --> 01:31:03.024
Please...

01:31:04.957 --> 01:31:06.226
I just want to know the truth.

01:31:09.695 --> 01:31:10.698
Where is he?

01:31:14.734 --> 01:31:16.703
I need you to let this go, Liz.

01:31:18.137 --> 01:31:19.140
No, I...

01:31:19.907 --> 01:31:21.074
I can't.

01:31:29.583 --> 01:31:31.117
Andy was many things but...

01:31:33.086 --> 01:31:34.889
he wouldn't have
left without this.

01:31:38.625 --> 01:31:39.659
That's right.

01:31:40.293 --> 01:31:41.662
Can you tell me?

01:31:43.063 --> 01:31:44.632
Can you tell me where he is?

01:31:46.233 --> 01:31:48.101
- Please.
- I just really need,

01:31:48.202 --> 01:31:50.171
need for you to tell me
where he is. Is he hurt?

01:31:51.637 --> 01:31:52.806
Did something happen to him?

01:31:52.907 --> 01:31:55.643
Was it an accident?

01:31:55.975 --> 01:31:57.777
I just need to know. I need
to know what happened to him.

01:31:57.877 --> 01:31:59.279
I need you to tell me.

01:31:59.380 --> 01:32:01.615
Jack, please.
Please, just talk to me.

01:32:01.716 --> 01:32:03.584
- Calm down.
- Talk to me, I need you to tell me.

01:32:03.684 --> 01:32:04.985
- Calm down.
- What happened to him?

01:32:05.086 --> 01:32:05.987
We can make this work.

01:32:06.087 --> 01:32:06.921
- Where is he?
- Stop.

01:32:07.020 --> 01:32:07.921
Can you please just,

01:32:08.021 --> 01:32:10.024
just talk to me?
Just look at me.

01:32:10.123 --> 01:32:11.826
- I just need...
- Please, Liz, stop it!

01:32:11.926 --> 01:32:13.761
- It's okay, I just...
- We can make this work.

01:32:13.793 --> 01:32:16.564
No! I just need you to, no,
Jack, please.

01:32:16.596 --> 01:32:18.032
- Liz, stop!
- Jack, please.

01:32:18.131 --> 01:32:20.867
- Just talk to me, just talk to me...
- Liz! Stop it.

01:32:20.900 --> 01:32:21.935
Please.
