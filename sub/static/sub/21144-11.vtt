WEBVTT

00:04.279 --> 00:06.113
Paige! Frankie!

00:06.148 --> 00:08.106
Hey, Shemika! What's up?

00:08.141 --> 00:09.941
Stay right there.
I need to ask you something.

00:13.898 --> 00:15.930
So, the thing is...

00:15.966 --> 00:17.090
Oh! Hang on.

00:23.857 --> 00:26.191
(panting)

00:26.226 --> 00:28.810
Anyway... oh! Hang on.

00:30.772 --> 00:33.231
(limbo music playing)

00:45.036 --> 00:47.370
So... what's going on?

00:49.266 --> 00:50.440
Uh, not much. You?

00:50.476 --> 00:51.476
Not much.

00:52.886 --> 00:54.211
- See ya around.
- Both: Later.

00:57.699 --> 00:58.757
I love this place.

01:54.381 --> 01:55.891
I'm surprised you like
babysitting your neighbor.

01:55.915 --> 01:57.224
You don't usually like kids.

01:57.259 --> 01:58.851
Yeah, but Savannah's cool.

01:58.886 --> 02:01.319
She's cute,
she does whatever I say,

02:01.354 --> 02:03.580
plus, she watches my favorite
Russian soap operas...

02:03.615 --> 02:05.982
Without interrupting.

02:06.018 --> 02:07.951
I never remember which Igor
is the bad one!

02:10.481 --> 02:12.266
Did you know the dog is
the cousin of the fox?

02:12.290 --> 02:13.898
Paige's cousin's a fox!

02:13.934 --> 02:15.000
What are you doing?

02:17.479 --> 02:21.490
I love animals, but
insects are my favorite.

02:21.525 --> 02:24.651
That's why I'm doing
my science fair project

02:24.687 --> 02:27.604
on my most favorite insect
of all time.

02:27.639 --> 02:28.639
Are you ready for it?

02:29.774 --> 02:31.141
Crickets!

02:33.011 --> 02:35.295
Aww! Crickets are so cute.

02:35.330 --> 02:36.905
Not as cute as your cousin.
Am I right?

02:36.940 --> 02:37.940
It's never gonna happen.

02:40.411 --> 02:44.212
My science fair project is
going to be the best.

02:44.247 --> 02:48.325
Except, for maybe Simon's, since his
parents are doing his whole project.

02:48.360 --> 02:49.409
Both: What?

02:51.179 --> 02:53.454
I can't believe
we lost to Trevor.

02:53.490 --> 02:55.966
We put so much time into this.

02:56.043 --> 02:58.376
Robot: Trevor's parents
didn't help build me at all.

03:01.698 --> 03:04.391
I can also vacuum up trash.

03:04.426 --> 03:06.518
Hey, Paige and Frankie,

03:06.595 --> 03:08.711
why don't you throw
your project in front of me?

03:08.746 --> 03:09.746
(laughs)

03:17.823 --> 03:20.414
(scoffs) His parents did
the whole beeping thing!

03:20.450 --> 03:23.251
And the rest of the robot too!

03:23.287 --> 03:26.596
We poured our heart
and soul into that project,

03:26.631 --> 03:28.707
and we lost to a cheater!
It was humiliating!

03:28.742 --> 03:30.383
It made us feel so dumb!

03:30.419 --> 03:32.085
I never wanna feel
like that ever again.

03:32.120 --> 03:34.788
We have to right this wrong.

03:34.823 --> 03:37.623
- We cannot let what happened to us happen to Savannah.
- You're right.

03:38.835 --> 03:41.228
(sighs) Savannah?

03:41.263 --> 03:43.766
Good news. Frankie and I are gonna
help you win the science fair.

03:43.790 --> 03:47.351
Oh. Okay. Fine.

03:47.386 --> 03:51.304
Hey, Frankie, wanna go watch
your Russian soap opera?

03:53.150 --> 03:56.609
Today, good Igor meets bad Igor

03:56.644 --> 03:58.795
and gets his revenge!

03:58.830 --> 04:01.523
You see? She's seven
and she gets it.

04:06.404 --> 04:09.147
Bernie, are you still
Bizaardvark's agent?

04:09.182 --> 04:10.502
I am until they fire me!
Pound it.

04:11.526 --> 04:13.926
Oh.

04:13.962 --> 04:16.321
Reassuring. (Clears throat)

04:16.356 --> 04:18.206
There have been some discussions

04:18.241 --> 04:20.150
about the future
of certain channels.

04:20.185 --> 04:21.428
I need you to give
a presentation

04:21.452 --> 04:22.530
about Bizaardvark
at the end of the week.

04:22.554 --> 04:24.946
It is very important,

04:24.981 --> 04:27.298
so listen closely
to my instructions.

04:27.333 --> 04:29.117
(voice fading) First
of all, Bizaardvark...

04:29.152 --> 04:30.355
(Bernie thinking)
Very important.

04:30.379 --> 04:31.586
(Liam continues speaking)

04:31.621 --> 04:32.621
Bernie: Presentation.

04:34.249 --> 04:35.799
And as you can see
from this chart,

04:35.834 --> 04:36.834
the arrow goes...

04:39.313 --> 04:40.562
up?

04:43.050 --> 04:44.930
That was the greatest
presentation I ever heard!

04:46.152 --> 04:48.111
Mermaids, give Bernie his award!

04:51.275 --> 04:53.825
You are their king now.

04:53.860 --> 04:56.778
(fanfare plays)

04:56.813 --> 04:57.813
Yeah.

05:01.393 --> 05:03.443
And if you follow
those instructions exactly,

05:03.478 --> 05:04.622
Bizaardvark's future
should be saved.

05:04.646 --> 05:05.987
Good day.

05:06.023 --> 05:07.997
(whirring)

05:08.032 --> 05:12.010
Oh no, I didn't hear anything
Liam said about the presentation.

05:13.930 --> 05:15.055
Did you, Horse Face Guy?

05:25.008 --> 05:26.288
Well, that was a little helpful.

05:28.645 --> 05:30.105
- Hey, guys! I'm Paige.
- I'm Frankie.

05:30.129 --> 05:32.138
Both: And we're Bizaardvark!

05:32.173 --> 05:34.182
Today we are doing the seven
second challenge,

05:34.217 --> 05:35.776
where we take turns
trying to complete

05:35.811 --> 05:38.078
random tasks in just
seven seconds.

05:38.113 --> 05:40.880
Yeah, seven seconds is
definitely not a lot of time.

05:40.916 --> 05:42.668
I really don't see how we're gonna
be able to do the challenges.

05:42.692 --> 05:44.584
Yeah, some of them
are really hard.

05:44.619 --> 05:46.439
- Yeah, like, I don't really understand...
- (alarm blares)

05:46.463 --> 05:47.515
Making a peanut butter
and jelly sandwich

05:47.539 --> 05:49.697
- in just seven seconds. You got this?
- Okay. Ready?

05:49.733 --> 05:51.566
- Set.
- Both: Go.

05:51.601 --> 05:53.943
- Okay. You know what?
- There you go. Spread it evenly.

05:53.979 --> 05:55.770
Four seconds! Four seconds!

05:55.805 --> 05:57.188
- And I'm done!
- Oh!

05:57.224 --> 05:58.865
Go.

05:58.901 --> 06:01.093
- That's not... What? Eww!
- It's not going!

06:01.128 --> 06:02.602
- You're missing the sandwich!
- Ah!

06:02.638 --> 06:04.779
Eww! Okay, uh, one second.

06:04.814 --> 06:07.324
- (alarm blares)
- Oh!

06:07.359 --> 06:10.251
There's no "PB" on there,
it's just "J."

06:10.287 --> 06:13.454
I'm gonna have to declare this
a loser.

06:13.489 --> 06:18.726
Frankie and I are going to try to fold
this fitted sheet in just seven seconds.

06:18.762 --> 06:21.363
I'm not entirely sure how to
fold a fitted sheet in general.

06:21.398 --> 06:23.198
- Go.
- Okay, okay, fold, focus.

06:23.233 --> 06:25.400
Uh. Uh. Bring it in.
Bring it in.

06:25.435 --> 06:26.520
- Bring it in!
- Why is it so airy?

06:26.544 --> 06:28.286
I don't know! It's a parachute!

06:28.321 --> 06:30.713
- Okay, okay. Done.
- (alarm blares)

06:30.749 --> 06:32.773
- (laughs) It's so folded.
- Nice.

06:32.809 --> 06:34.009
- It's folded.
- It's, um...

06:34.044 --> 06:35.735
It's very nice.

06:35.770 --> 06:38.137
Seven seconds to state

06:38.173 --> 06:41.557
seven state capitals. Go.

06:41.592 --> 06:43.835
Sacramento, Albany,
Honolulu, Anchorage,

06:43.870 --> 06:45.787
Madison, um, St. Louis,
Carson City!

06:45.822 --> 06:48.807
(cheering)

06:48.842 --> 06:50.533
Yes! Wait! That's not one!

06:50.568 --> 06:52.861
I'm getting word
from our judges.

06:52.896 --> 06:55.538
St. Louis is not the capital.
It is Jefferson City.

06:55.573 --> 06:58.808
No, that was invalid.
(buzzes) You lose!

06:58.843 --> 07:00.676
Montgomery, Alabama.
Helena, Montana.

07:00.712 --> 07:02.595
(stammers) St. Louis, Missouri.

07:02.631 --> 07:05.231
(laughs) - No! What?
No! (Screams)

07:05.266 --> 07:07.450
- (alarm blares)
- The judges... no!

07:07.485 --> 07:09.861
- Both: The judges...
- I'm sorry!

07:09.896 --> 07:11.257
- It's not... it's not St. Louis.
- No, no, no, judges.

07:11.281 --> 07:13.105
- Please, let me try again.
- Nope.

07:13.141 --> 07:14.621
Please, oh please.
I will do anything.

07:19.181 --> 07:22.098
All right, Savannah.
Two days till the science fair.

07:22.134 --> 07:23.967
Let's see what
we're working with.

07:24.002 --> 07:26.544
Here's my cricket project.

07:26.579 --> 07:28.813
Also, I made a puppet,
and I named him Chirpo.

07:30.842 --> 07:33.551
Hey, there, Chirpo.
Can you talk?

07:33.586 --> 07:35.695
It's not real. It's made
from cloth and buttons.

07:38.341 --> 07:40.101
(mutters) You're made
from cloth and buttons.

07:41.244 --> 07:42.936
For the science fair,

07:42.971 --> 07:45.179
Chirpo's going to rhyme
facts about crickets.

07:45.215 --> 07:47.866
Chirp, chirp! I eat plants.

07:47.901 --> 07:49.768
Chirp, chirp! And fruit.

07:49.803 --> 07:50.877
And ants.

07:55.525 --> 07:56.965
Savannah, could you
give us a moment?

07:59.012 --> 08:01.404
- What is that?
- I don't know.

08:01.440 --> 08:04.557
It's like a sock...
that kind of rhymes.

08:06.269 --> 08:07.269
It's never gonna win!

08:09.114 --> 08:11.038
- We have to fix this.
- Yeah.

08:11.074 --> 08:12.154
- Good sidebar.
- (chuckles)

08:14.494 --> 08:18.613
Savannah? Chirpo is cute
and all, but...

08:18.648 --> 08:22.534
I'm not sure crickets
are gonna beat Simon's project

08:22.569 --> 08:24.944
- if his parents are doing it for him.
- Mm-hmm.

08:24.979 --> 08:26.863
And you wanna win, right?

08:26.898 --> 08:28.389
I guess.

08:28.425 --> 08:31.684
There's the eye of the tiger!

08:31.720 --> 08:32.535
So, what are we gonna
do to win this thing?

08:32.570 --> 08:38.499
Uh, we need something big,
electronic, and awesome, like, um...

08:38.534 --> 08:41.661
- like... like a UFO.
- Yeah, yeah, or... ooh! Or a satellite.

08:41.696 --> 08:43.805
Ooh! That's a real thing!
Let's go with that!

08:46.617 --> 08:49.035
Don't I get to help
think of ideas?

08:49.070 --> 08:51.446
Of course.

08:51.481 --> 08:53.657
It's your project, after all.

08:53.692 --> 08:57.936
How about you tell us
what you like about crickets,

08:57.971 --> 09:00.522
and we'll find
a new idea together.

09:00.557 --> 09:02.916
Well, I really like
their chirps.

09:02.951 --> 09:05.085
Hey! You know what else chirps?

09:05.161 --> 09:07.821
Those big electronic things
that orbit the Earth.

09:07.856 --> 09:10.465
- Satellites?
- (both gasp, shout)

09:10.500 --> 09:13.259
That is a great idea!

09:13.294 --> 09:15.637
- It's your idea.
- You're right!

09:15.672 --> 09:19.390
It is your idea! And we love it!

09:19.425 --> 09:20.892
That's why we're gonna build you

09:20.927 --> 09:22.413
- a fully-functioning satellite.
- Mm-hmm.

09:22.437 --> 09:24.178
(clicking)

09:27.934 --> 09:29.901
We've been working
at this for five hours.

09:29.936 --> 09:31.978
We have no idea
how to build a satellite.

09:32.014 --> 09:33.065
We're never gonna win
this thing.

09:33.089 --> 09:34.196
Wait.

09:34.232 --> 09:36.024
(clattering)

09:49.472 --> 09:51.039
I spelled my name
with the parts!

09:55.654 --> 09:59.972
Hey, guys! Paige and Frankie
here with Bernie to do the...

10:00.008 --> 10:02.817
- Challenge completed!
- You're not supposed to eat them.

10:02.853 --> 10:05.987
- Oh. I also thought I won.
- Okay.

10:06.022 --> 10:08.690
We put a spoon in our mouth
and strap a bowl to our heads.

10:08.725 --> 10:11.726
First one to put
three pieces of candy

10:11.761 --> 10:13.072
into their bowl without
using their hands wins.

10:13.096 --> 10:16.330
Ready? Go-oh.

10:16.366 --> 10:17.932
- Whoa! Got it!
- It fell off already!

10:17.967 --> 10:19.484
(dings)

10:19.519 --> 10:21.377
(muffled shout)

10:21.413 --> 10:23.120
- It in there?
- It fell out!

10:23.156 --> 10:24.672
It fell out!

10:24.708 --> 10:26.257
I know! You're carrying water

10:26.292 --> 10:27.634
back to the village!

10:27.669 --> 10:28.826
- Kids: What?
- No?

10:30.647 --> 10:33.689
- People are coming!
- Bernie's great at this!

10:33.724 --> 10:35.400
You've got three.
He's got three.

10:35.435 --> 10:37.694
- I bounced... I got one!
- You got one!

10:37.729 --> 10:40.563
This guy has four or five
of them in there.

10:40.599 --> 10:43.015
This is delicious.
What are you guys playing to?

10:43.051 --> 10:47.019
- Um, to three.
- Oh, he's already had like four or five.

10:47.055 --> 10:49.695
- Did you beat that, Bernie?
- He had four or five of them already.

10:50.458 --> 10:52.299
- Bernie.
- What?

10:52.335 --> 10:54.575
- You've gotta help clean up.
- What about the challenge?

10:55.605 --> 10:56.605
Bizaardvark.

10:59.301 --> 11:02.159
We need to find
the "We Know Science" channel.

11:02.195 --> 11:04.912
They can help us build Savannah's
satellite and win the fair.

11:04.948 --> 11:06.892
Oh, Viking Guy, have you seen
the "We Know Science" channel?

11:06.916 --> 11:10.018
I'll tell you what I've seen.

11:10.053 --> 11:12.729
An army of men meet
their demise at the hands

11:12.764 --> 11:14.444
- of the Ice Queen of Morosa.
- Found them!

11:16.952 --> 11:18.835
I was helpful! (Laughs)

11:20.204 --> 11:23.147
Okay, remember, these guys
are way smarter than us,

11:23.183 --> 11:25.742
so just act confident
and don't let on

11:25.777 --> 11:27.577
that we have no idea
what we're talking about.

11:27.937 --> 11:31.480
(sighs) Fellow scientists!

11:31.515 --> 11:34.992
We have a... proposal.

11:35.028 --> 11:38.738
(chuckles)
Nice. It's going well so far.

11:38.774 --> 11:41.982
Aren't you the channel that makes
ridiculous videos, like Puke Train?

11:42.018 --> 11:45.886
Uh, first of all,
it's Puke Plane.

11:45.922 --> 11:48.100
And second, there's a lot more to
our videos than meets the eye.

11:48.124 --> 11:49.941
Like what?

11:49.976 --> 11:52.660
Oh, well, if you don't know,

11:52.695 --> 11:55.274
we've obviously come to the wrong
science channel. -(Scoffs) Yeah.

11:55.298 --> 11:58.332
Come on, Frankie. Let's find someone
who can understand a proposal.

12:00.536 --> 12:02.123
- Did we take it too far?
- Yeah, I think we blew it.

12:02.147 --> 12:04.600
- How long do we walk before we turn back and beg?
- We're running out of room.

12:04.624 --> 12:05.757
- Just slow down.
- Wait!

12:07.669 --> 12:08.885
Both: Yes?

12:11.339 --> 12:13.130
We get it now.

12:13.166 --> 12:15.917
Your videos must be filled
with cryptograms and codes

12:15.952 --> 12:18.745
intended for interplanetary
communications.

12:18.780 --> 12:21.150
I mean, why else would you make a stupid
video about a plane filled with puke?

12:21.174 --> 12:23.841
First of all, it ran... on puke.

12:23.877 --> 12:27.537
But... you're right.

12:27.572 --> 12:31.557
Our latest project
is extremely important.

12:31.592 --> 12:33.985
- What is it?
- (both laugh)

12:34.020 --> 12:35.078
Wouldn't you like to know?

12:35.113 --> 12:36.113
Yes.

12:38.232 --> 12:41.325
Oh. Uh... it's a satellite.

12:41.360 --> 12:43.928
Wow! A satellite?

12:44.005 --> 12:45.566
Are we talking geosynchronous
or geostationary?

12:45.590 --> 12:48.124
Whoa! Why don't you just build

12:48.159 --> 12:49.559
the whole thing
while you're at it!

12:49.594 --> 12:51.694
- Unless you want us to walk away again.
- Yeah.

12:51.730 --> 12:52.662
No! No, no, no, no,
we'll build it.

12:52.697 --> 12:56.065
You're the first people that
have ever spoken to us here.

12:56.101 --> 12:58.735
Aww. I mean...

12:58.770 --> 13:00.520
have it on our desk
by 9:00 a.m. tomorrow.

13:00.555 --> 13:01.555
Ow.

13:07.978 --> 13:09.545
What am I gonna do?
What am I gonna do?

13:09.580 --> 13:11.372
(whirring)

13:11.407 --> 13:12.957
Liam! Do you have a sec?

13:12.992 --> 13:14.033
Yes, I have regrets.

13:17.180 --> 13:20.398
So, I have a couple of questions
about the presentation.

13:20.433 --> 13:22.520
I totally heard you, and I
get what you're looking for.

13:22.544 --> 13:24.496
I'm just a little confused
on some of the details.

13:24.520 --> 13:26.353
You remind me of my nephew.

13:26.389 --> 13:29.240
He gets easily confused
by details too.

13:29.275 --> 13:31.893
Of course, he's five,
so it's appropriate.

13:31.895 --> 13:35.104
Anyway, the presentation
should start with...

13:35.140 --> 13:37.757
(Liam's voice fades) -(Bernie
thinking) Liam's Nephew.

13:37.792 --> 13:38.975
Liam's Nephew.

13:41.445 --> 13:46.098
Mermaids, I'd like you to meet my nephew.
He's just like me,

13:46.134 --> 13:47.942
only better looking
and far more important.

13:49.845 --> 13:52.071
Whee!

13:54.943 --> 13:55.943
'Sup, mermaids?

13:59.706 --> 14:01.372
Robot yeah.

14:05.386 --> 14:08.971
And that is why I cannot repeat
these instructions ever again,

14:09.007 --> 14:12.149
so see you tomorrow at the presentation.
And remember...

14:12.185 --> 14:14.510
Bizaardvark's future
depends on it.

14:18.274 --> 14:19.714
Aah, that time
it felt like my fault.

14:22.411 --> 14:23.661
Greetings, Viking warriors!

14:23.696 --> 14:24.729
It is I...

14:26.557 --> 14:28.357
- With...
- No.

14:28.392 --> 14:32.211
- You have not earned that name yet.
- (horns smash)

14:32.247 --> 14:35.590
Today we will be playing,
Can This Be a Ship?

14:35.625 --> 14:38.078
We're gonna put different objects in the
water to see if they can be a ship.

14:38.102 --> 14:40.378
If it floats, it's a ship.

14:40.455 --> 14:42.007
- If it doesn't float, it's...
- Both: Not a ship!

14:42.031 --> 14:44.331
(horn blares)

14:44.367 --> 14:45.549
- Let us begin!
- Yeah!

14:45.585 --> 14:47.568
A cowboy hat?

14:47.603 --> 14:50.095
Both: Can this be a ship?

14:50.131 --> 14:51.892
- This is definitely gonna float.
- I don't think it's a ship.

14:51.916 --> 14:54.325
- Oh. Oh!
- No! Eric! Eric!

14:54.361 --> 14:55.361
Both: Not a ship!

14:56.737 --> 14:59.597
Both: Can this be a ship?

14:59.632 --> 15:01.309
- You really think a rock could be a...
- Small rocks float.

15:01.333 --> 15:03.734
Stop!

15:03.769 --> 15:05.252
Look! It's called a submarine.

15:05.288 --> 15:06.788
Both: Not a ship!

15:06.823 --> 15:08.881
Can this be a ship?

15:08.916 --> 15:10.436
What even is that?
Like a bubblewrap...

15:10.468 --> 15:12.151
It's a bubblewrap...
turtle, yes.

15:14.931 --> 15:16.542
- Yeah. That's a good ship.
- That is such a good ship!

15:16.566 --> 15:18.290
Both: Is a ship.

15:18.325 --> 15:19.525
- Yo!
- A burrito-ship?

15:19.560 --> 15:21.752
Both: Can this be a ship?

15:21.787 --> 15:23.696
I guarantee you, this will sink.

15:23.731 --> 15:25.865
Stop!
Well, that's like a block of...

15:25.900 --> 15:29.893
- Ohh...!
- What?

15:29.929 --> 15:31.470
He just couldn't ride
in the beast!

15:31.506 --> 15:32.830
A cell phone!

15:32.865 --> 15:34.798
Both: Can this be a ship?

15:34.834 --> 15:36.625
- Ooh! Ooh!
- (cell phone rings)

15:36.660 --> 15:39.286
- What a waste of a phone.
- Is that your grandmother calling?

15:39.321 --> 15:41.856
- What?
- That is your phone.

15:41.858 --> 15:44.934
- What? Dude, I'm on a 10-year plan!
- (laughing)

15:44.969 --> 15:46.689
- Call someone who cares!
- That's not funny!

15:46.713 --> 15:48.487
This is but
another episode of...

15:48.523 --> 15:51.232
(both speak)

15:51.267 --> 15:53.567
If you want to borrow my
horn... I don't have any...

15:53.603 --> 15:55.444
- (horn blares)
- Yeah!

15:59.433 --> 16:01.609
- Rocket?
- Lame.

16:01.644 --> 16:04.111
- The water cycle?
- Boring!

16:04.146 --> 16:05.738
Fully-functioning satellite?

16:05.773 --> 16:08.199
- Winner!
- Yeah!

16:08.234 --> 16:10.810
Think we got this.

16:10.845 --> 16:13.729
All the other projects vacuums?
'Cause all I'm hearing is sucking!

16:13.764 --> 16:15.089
Both: Oh!

16:18.294 --> 16:20.995
So, what do you think
of your satellite?

16:21.030 --> 16:24.673
It's really big,
but I didn't build any of it.

16:24.708 --> 16:26.684
What? Savannah.

16:28.880 --> 16:31.389
You made this happen.
You said, "satellite,"

16:31.424 --> 16:33.190
and now bam!
There's a satellite.

16:35.036 --> 16:36.760
But I don't even know
what it does.

16:36.796 --> 16:40.055
Savannah!

16:40.090 --> 16:42.675
You're an adorable
seven-year-old girl.

16:42.711 --> 16:45.719
Just stand next to the
satellite, be yourself,

16:45.754 --> 16:47.994
- and read this script we wrote, word for word.
- Mm-hmm.

16:48.449 --> 16:49.999
(horn blares)

16:51.819 --> 16:55.454
Viking Guy?
What are you doing here?

16:55.489 --> 16:57.929
My young brother is doing a project
on the science of Vikings.

17:02.321 --> 17:04.764
Viking Child,
show them exhibit "A."

17:10.230 --> 17:11.512
Exhibit "B."

17:11.547 --> 17:12.730
Mm-hmm.

17:14.917 --> 17:17.042
Exhibit "C"! (Laughs) -(thuds)

17:17.078 --> 17:20.187
- (giggles)
- He's only seven years old,

17:20.223 --> 17:21.943
but he's catapulting
at a 12-year-old level.

17:23.693 --> 17:25.284
Hey, Savannah,
which kid is Simon?

17:27.280 --> 17:29.188
Virtual reality?

17:29.223 --> 17:32.591
Look at the parents.
So proud of themselves.

17:32.626 --> 17:34.001
(no discernible dialog)

17:34.037 --> 17:35.978
They clearly did
the whole project

17:36.014 --> 17:38.931
and totally cheated
our little Savannah,

17:38.966 --> 17:40.625
who worked her butt off
on her project.

17:40.660 --> 17:43.769
- It's disgusting.
- Oh.

17:43.804 --> 17:47.664
And look at them. They probably told him
exactly what to say and what to do.

17:47.700 --> 17:49.519
So, remember: Stick to the script
and don't touch the satellite.

17:49.543 --> 17:50.543
- Good luck.
- Have fun.

17:54.523 --> 17:57.199
"This satellite is...

17:57.235 --> 17:59.201
g... geo..."

17:59.236 --> 18:00.436
(both whisper) Geosynchronous.

18:02.548 --> 18:04.915
I don't know how
to say these words.

18:04.950 --> 18:07.201
And... I don't wanna do this!

18:11.807 --> 18:13.165
Viking Guy:
I can't see anything!

18:14.835 --> 18:16.719
Am I missing
something important?

18:16.754 --> 18:17.754
I feel like I might be!

18:22.876 --> 18:24.195
- What's up guys? I'm Paige.
- I'm Frankie.

18:24.219 --> 18:26.086
And we're Bizaardvark.

18:26.122 --> 18:27.707
- Can pizza ever be bad?
- I don't know. Let's find out.

18:27.731 --> 18:30.265
It's the...

18:30.300 --> 18:32.418
We are going to take turns
choosing toppings

18:32.453 --> 18:33.839
- from each of these bags.
- Mm-hmm.

18:33.863 --> 18:35.646
Some of the toppings
will be delicious,

18:35.682 --> 18:37.949
others will be disgusting.

18:38.025 --> 18:40.034
Then we're put them in
the pizza oven over there...

18:40.069 --> 18:41.677
(Italian music plays)

18:41.712 --> 18:45.080
cook 'em up and eat one entire slice.
Are you ready?

18:45.115 --> 18:47.116
- Buon appetito!
- Is that "yes"?

18:49.069 --> 18:50.002
- It's "buon appetito."
- What's that mean?

18:50.037 --> 18:52.388
(Italian music plays)

18:52.423 --> 18:53.423
Both: Ah!

18:54.875 --> 18:57.976
Ooh! Ooh-ooh! It's...

18:58.012 --> 19:02.064
Ooh, girl! No! It's chunky!

19:02.099 --> 19:03.849
- What?
- I got...

19:03.884 --> 19:05.676
I think it's pepperoni.

19:05.712 --> 19:06.712
It's probably pepperoni.

19:08.172 --> 19:09.563
What is it? (Laughs) What is it?

19:09.598 --> 19:10.973
- What I...
- It's...

19:12.518 --> 19:14.110
- Mmm!
- On a pizza?

19:14.145 --> 19:16.089
I don't know what these are.
I think they're, like...

19:16.113 --> 19:18.713
Ah! (Shouts)

19:18.749 --> 19:20.708
(screams)

19:20.743 --> 19:22.559
(screams)

19:22.594 --> 19:25.237
(gags)

19:25.272 --> 19:26.584
- Frankie: Ooh, I know. (Laughs)
- That smells like dead fish!

19:26.608 --> 19:30.075
Oh no! I got mushrooms! (Laughs)

19:30.110 --> 19:33.245
(bell dings) - Oh my
gosh, this smells so bad.

19:33.280 --> 19:35.225
- I don't wanna do this.
- I'm so excited to try this.

19:35.249 --> 19:36.924
What about you? Are you excited?

19:36.959 --> 19:38.884
- Not at all.
- Oh yeah, me too.

19:38.919 --> 19:40.752
- Mmm.
- Is it good?

19:40.788 --> 19:43.005
You want? Mmm, I'm sorry.

19:46.686 --> 19:49.678
- Ooh!
- (screams)

19:53.034 --> 19:54.892
(distorted laugh)

19:54.928 --> 19:56.293
- What did we learn?
- Pizzas...

19:56.329 --> 19:57.878
Both: Can be bad.

19:57.914 --> 20:00.356
Hey! Oh my gosh! No!

20:00.391 --> 20:01.774
(distorted) Why?

20:04.678 --> 20:07.337
Savannah? What's wrong?

20:07.373 --> 20:09.823
(sniffles) I don't wanna
do my satellite project.

20:11.460 --> 20:14.870
I wanna do my cricket project.

20:14.906 --> 20:16.263
But if you do that, we'll lose.

20:16.298 --> 20:18.207
You mean I'll lose!

20:20.470 --> 20:23.504
This was supposed
to be my project,

20:23.539 --> 20:24.858
and you guys didn't
let me do any of it!

20:24.882 --> 20:27.024
- Well, we were just trying to help you win.
- Yeah.

20:27.059 --> 20:28.384
I don't care if I win.

20:29.946 --> 20:31.262
I just love science.

20:33.232 --> 20:34.432
Frankie, what's wrong with us?

20:36.285 --> 20:38.193
We are so sorry, Savannah.

20:38.229 --> 20:42.273
We made this whole thing about us and
we totally ignored what you wanted.

20:44.401 --> 20:45.904
Is there any way
we can make it up to you?

20:45.928 --> 20:49.179
(giggles) I have an idea.

20:49.214 --> 20:51.965
- Chirp, chirp?
- Chirpity, chirp, chirp!

20:52.001 --> 20:53.103
(whispers) We could add
some jokes if you want.

20:53.127 --> 20:55.703
- Stick to the script.
- Okay.

20:55.738 --> 20:58.083
Are you sure? 'Cause I still feel
like we could win this thing.

20:58.107 --> 20:59.387
Do you want
to make me cry again?

21:01.810 --> 21:02.668
- Chirp, chirp, chirp.
- Chirpity, chirp, chirp!

21:02.703 --> 21:04.336
(both chirping)

21:08.659 --> 21:10.008
(chirping continues
over headsets)

21:10.044 --> 21:12.577
The chirps keep getting louder.

21:12.613 --> 21:15.698
This proves the existence of an
undiscovered cricket planet!

21:15.733 --> 21:16.733
Ed, you were right!

21:19.237 --> 21:21.820
Oh. No, no, no.
I hear little kids.

21:21.855 --> 21:24.331
It's obviously a science fair.

21:24.367 --> 21:26.400
You are why no one
talks to us here!

21:30.647 --> 21:34.616
All right, Bernie. You've
had three glasses of water

21:34.652 --> 21:36.618
and five bathroom breaks.

21:36.654 --> 21:38.037
I'm ready for the presentation.

21:38.072 --> 21:40.856
Right. The...

21:40.891 --> 21:43.801
presentation Bizaardvark's
future depends on.

21:43.878 --> 21:45.678
- Can I get more water? I'll just...
- Bernie.

21:47.114 --> 21:48.505
Okay.

21:49.808 --> 21:53.652
Here goes.

21:53.687 --> 21:55.890
A lot of people ask, where does
the name Bizaardvark come from?

21:55.914 --> 21:58.382
(mouths)

21:58.417 --> 22:01.752
But we won't get
into that today.

22:01.788 --> 22:04.713
No. That's stupid.

22:04.748 --> 22:07.825
That's blank. Now, don't
quit on me, Liam.

22:07.860 --> 22:09.652
(Liam thinking) Quit.

22:09.687 --> 22:12.246
Ah, to quit.

22:12.281 --> 22:15.315
(soothing music plays)

22:15.350 --> 22:17.234
(sighs)

22:17.269 --> 22:20.946
No more boring Vuuugle problems.

22:20.981 --> 22:23.073
This is how a man should live.

22:23.108 --> 22:25.167
Right, mermaids?

22:28.089 --> 22:29.421
Liam yeah.

22:31.859 --> 22:33.959
And that sums up

22:33.994 --> 22:35.177
the future of Bizaardvark.

22:36.797 --> 22:37.797
Any questions?

22:40.551 --> 22:43.469
Uhh... nope.

22:43.504 --> 22:44.504
That checks out.

22:45.873 --> 22:47.523
Really?

22:49.718 --> 22:51.235
Yes...?

22:52.746 --> 22:57.916
Cool! No take-backs!
