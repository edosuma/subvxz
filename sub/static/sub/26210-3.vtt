01:15.415 --> 01:16.182
they shake your hand.

01:16.182 --> 01:16.683
It's like...

01:16.683 --> 01:17.483
BRIE: Can you just say

01:17.483 --> 01:17.984

01:19.920 --> 01:21.922

01:21.922 --> 01:22.923
BRIE: It's just, like, when

01:22.923 --> 01:24.090
you say "penis," it's just,

01:24.090 --> 01:24.658
like, geez...

01:24.658 --> 01:25.358
NIKKI: Well, "pee‐pee" and

01:25.358 --> 01:26.627
"penis" is the same thing, so...

01:26.627 --> 01:27.493
BRIE: But "pee‐pee," you can

01:27.493 --> 01:28.394

01:28.394 --> 01:29.530
NIKKI: Pee‐pee sounds...

01:29.530 --> 01:30.196
Can you?

01:30.196 --> 01:31.364
Because that sounds perverted to

me.

01:32.065 --> 01:34.167
Winston's wiener is called a

01:34.167 --> 01:35.468

BRIE: If you ever said

01:36.637 --> 01:37.504
"penis" in front of Birdie, I'd

01:37.504 --> 01:38.505

06:06.172 --> 06:06.973

06:06.973 --> 06:08.542
It's his debut for a movie.

06:08.542 --> 06:09.309
PAIGE: Hmm.

06:09.309 --> 06:10.310
LANA: So of course,

06:10.310 --> 06:11.311
apparently, with his four or

06:11.311 --> 06:12.378
five lines, he thinks he's a

06:12.378 --> 06:13.113
movie star.

06:13.113 --> 06:14.114
PAIGE: What movie is it?

06:14.114 --> 06:15.649
LANA: It's a romantic comedy.

06:15.649 --> 06:17.017
It's about parallel universes.

06:17.017 --> 06:19.352
Actually, we raised $500,000 for

06:19.352 --> 06:20.654
the movie, to produce this

06:20.654 --> 06:21.154
movie.

06:21.154 --> 06:24.057
Since I am not on TV right now,

06:24.057 --> 06:25.992
and since I do not have that

06:25.992 --> 06:27.994
outlet to tell stories on TV,

06:27.994 --> 06:29.896
I've taken it into my own hands

06:29.896 --> 06:31.632
to produce a movie with my

06:31.632 --> 06:33.033
brother called <i>Other Versions of</i>

06:33.033 --> 06:34.000
You.

06:34.000 --> 06:35.602

06:35.602 --> 06:36.803

06:36.803 --> 06:38.438
GWYNETH: Oh. That's Kiril.

06:38.438 --> 06:42.042
We used to date, but it's cool.

06:42.042 --> 06:43.744
KIRIL: I'm watching you.

06:43.744 --> 06:44.911
LANA: This is Rusev's first

06:44.911 --> 06:46.647
movie, and I am one of the

06:46.647 --> 06:47.748
supporting roles.

06:47.748 --> 06:49.115
But most importantly, what I'm

06:49.115 --> 06:50.416
really, really excited about is

06:50.416 --> 06:52.586
that it's my first movie that I

06:52.586 --> 06:53.754
am producing.

06:53.754 --> 06:54.621

RUSEV: I am a big movie star.

07:00.400 --> 07:01.434
Or a big movie producer, is

07:01.434 --> 07:02.268
that's what's gonna happen?

07:02.268 --> 07:03.103
RUSEV: I am an entrepreneur.

07:03.103 --> 07:03.670
LANA: Oh, yeah.

I have plenty of houses for you.

22:51.752 --> 22:52.753
hope and wish that I create some

22:52.753 --> 22:53.754
type of buzz.

22:53.754 --> 22:54.855
Then maybe, like, I will

22:54.855 --> 22:56.489
actually be put into a story of

22:56.489 --> 22:57.490
some sort.

22:57.490 --> 22:59.793
RUSEV: Oh, you think that

22:59.793 --> 23:02.102
that movie is gonna give you

23:02.102 --> 23:03.504
popularity?

23:03.504 --> 23:05.238
And that's gonna help you get

23:05.238 --> 23:06.239
booked on TV?

23:06.239 --> 23:07.307
LANA: I mean, yeah.

23:07.307 --> 23:08.975
Ideally it would be to be able

23:08.975 --> 23:10.744
to create buzz around it that

23:10.744 --> 23:12.245
does help me get booked.

23:12.245 --> 23:15.015
This movie means a lot to me

23:15.015 --> 23:17.450
because it's me telling a story,

23:17.450 --> 23:19.119
and ever since I was a little

23:19.119 --> 23:20.120
girl, I've wanted to tell

23:20.120 --> 23:21.121
stories.

23:21.121 --> 23:22.556
I want to be in something that

23:22.556 --> 23:23.657
is compelling, and there's

23:23.657 --> 23:24.758
nothing like that in the world

23:24.758 --> 23:26.126
that gives you that feeling,

23:26.126 --> 23:27.160
nothing in the world that gives

23:27.160 --> 23:28.428
you that high and that

23:28.428 --> 23:30.597
adrenaline rush than telling a

23:30.597 --> 23:32.132
compelling story that moves

23:32.132 --> 23:33.133
people's souls.

23:33.133 --> 23:35.135
You can say, "Oh, cheer up.

23:35.135 --> 23:36.269
Oh, be patient.

23:36.269 --> 23:37.504
Be happy regardless of your

23:37.504 --> 23:38.505
circumstance."

23:38.505 --> 23:39.506
It's hard.

23:39.506 --> 23:41.174
Maybe I just really suck.

23:41.174 --> 23:42.475
Maybe I'm literally (bleep)

23:42.475 --> 23:43.476
delusional.

23:43.476 --> 23:44.878
I just feel like I'm in the back

23:44.878 --> 23:46.346
and being forgotten.

23:46.346 --> 23:47.681
There's nothing I can do to

23:47.681 --> 23:48.682
change it.

23:48.682 --> 23:50.450
I just miss it.

23:50.450 --> 23:54.254
RUSEV: I know you do.

23:54.254 --> 23:55.255
I know you do.

23:55.255 --> 23:56.256

23:56.256 --> 23:57.257

RUSEV: You're not doing

23:58.258 --> 23:59.259
anything wrong.

23:59.259 --> 24:00.534
You're doing everything right.

24:00.534 --> 24:01.535
You're always in the ring

24:01.535 --> 24:02.402
training.

24:02.402 --> 24:03.469
You're always practicing your

24:03.469 --> 24:04.470
promos at home.

24:04.470 --> 24:05.739
You're fricking shooting a movie

24:05.739 --> 24:06.740
on your off days.

24:06.740 --> 24:08.842
And you're super pretty and hot.

24:08.842 --> 24:10.010
(Lana laughs)

24:10.010 --> 24:11.344
You have the talent.

24:11.344 --> 24:12.345
You have the ability.

24:12.345 --> 24:13.647
You have the passion.

24:13.647 --> 24:14.848
You have every single thing.

24:14.848 --> 24:16.116
And that's why I'm gonna help

24:16.116 --> 24:18.184
you with this movie.

24:20.453 --> 24:22.055
If you want me to be naked, I'll

24:22.055 --> 24:23.056
be naked.

24:23.056 --> 24:24.825
(Lana laughs)

24:24.825 --> 24:26.426
Because you deserve it.

24:26.426 --> 24:30.096
LANA: I love you.

24:30.096 --> 24:31.497
RUSEV: Now let's cheers.

24:31.497 --> 24:32.666
(Lana laughs)

24:32.666 --> 24:33.967
For publicity stunts.

24:33.967 --> 24:37.303
To balls out.

24:37.303 --> 24:39.606
To rock out with my (bleep) out.

24:39.606 --> 24:41.041
I will do it.

24:41.041 --> 24:42.042
LANA: Cheers.

24:42.042 --> 24:44.110
RUSEV: Cheers.

24:48.882 --> 24:50.316
going on in my backyard, but I

24:50.316 --> 24:51.317
don't like it.

24:51.317 --> 24:52.318
JON: Get them lit.

24:52.318 --> 24:53.319
Smoke them up.

24:53.319 --> 24:54.320
It don't get no more natural

24:54.320 --> 24:55.722
than this.

24:55.722 --> 24:56.790
LANA: Are you excited for our

24:56.790 --> 24:57.791
publicity stunt?

24:57.791 --> 24:58.792
I was thinking about doing it

24:58.792 --> 24:59.860
naked.

24:59.860 --> 25:01.234
So, I hired a photographer to

25:01.234 --> 25:02.869
create some buzz.

25:02.869 --> 25:04.938

JON: Hey, so, uh, I know how

25:19.019 --> 25:20.020
you like, you know, honey and

25:20.020 --> 25:21.021
that you're trying to fix your

25:21.021 --> 25:21.888
sweet tooth.

25:21.888 --> 25:22.889
I'm trying to fix your sweet

TRINITY: Give me some of

25:26.292 --> 25:27.293
that.

25:27.293 --> 25:28.595
That at least got some kind of

sugar in it.

25:31.998 --> 25:33.700

JON: Mm‐hmm.

25:39.272 --> 25:40.273
It's natural.

25:40.273 --> 25:41.074
It's fresh honey.

25:41.074 --> 25:41.875
You like sweets, and I'm trying

TRINITY: I don't know what's

26:01.001 --> 26:02.503
going on in my backyard, but I

26:02.503 --> 26:03.570
don't like it.

26:03.570 --> 26:05.806
I get him wanting to have

26:05.806 --> 26:08.108
natural honey and wanting me to

26:08.108 --> 26:10.944
be healthier and better, but Jon

26:10.944 --> 26:13.346
has lost his last damn mind.

26:13.346 --> 26:15.015
Question: have they gotten

26:15.015 --> 26:16.016
through the suits before?

26:16.016 --> 26:17.017
DANIELLE: No, because we're

26:17.017 --> 26:17.851
gonna zip you up.

26:17.851 --> 26:18.685
I'm gonna, like, double and

26:18.685 --> 26:19.620
triple‐check you.

26:19.620 --> 26:20.621
And then we're gonna take you

26:20.621 --> 26:21.487
outside, and you're gonna be

26:21.487 --> 26:22.322
fine.

26:22.322 --> 26:23.123
You've got this.

26:23.123 --> 26:26.059
These are bee suits.

26:26.059 --> 26:27.127
JON: We're going right in,

26:27.127 --> 26:28.128
then, all right.

26:28.128 --> 26:29.129
I feel like I'm about to be on

26:29.129 --> 26:30.030
Breaking Bad.

26:30.030 --> 26:31.031
You ever watch <i>Breaking Bad?</i>

26:31.031 --> 26:32.032
Boom!

26:32.032 --> 26:33.033
TRINITY: Do UGGs work?

26:33.033 --> 26:34.735
JON: You look like you're

26:34.735 --> 26:35.736
about to go on the Moon.

26:35.736 --> 26:39.105
I feel like I'm about to...

26:39.105 --> 26:40.106
TRINITY: We landed on the

26:40.106 --> 26:41.107
Moon!

26:41.107 --> 26:42.108
JON: Yeah, you look like you

26:42.108 --> 26:43.009
about to go to the Moon.

26:43.009 --> 26:44.010
You look like you about to go

26:44.010 --> 26:45.245
right up there with Armstrong,

26:45.245 --> 26:48.214
Mr. Neil Armstrong.

26:48.214 --> 26:49.550
I watch a lot of <i>Planet Earth,</i>

26:49.550 --> 26:51.051
so I'll tell y'all, that's gonna

26:51.051 --> 26:52.285
be the best honey in the world.

26:52.285 --> 26:53.286
DANIELLE: It is, and it's so

26:53.286 --> 26:54.287
good for you because it's not

26:54.287 --> 26:55.288
processed.

26:55.288 --> 26:56.857
JON: We are taking a step in

26:56.857 --> 26:58.258
a healthy direction with this.

26:58.258 --> 26:59.259
DANIELLE: Gonna smoke them up

26:59.259 --> 27:00.634
a little bit, and we're gonna

27:00.634 --> 27:01.635
get started.

27:01.635 --> 27:02.636
JON: Get them lit.

27:02.636 --> 27:03.637
Smoke them up.

27:03.637 --> 27:04.905
DANIELLE: It masks the smell

27:04.905 --> 27:06.372
of alert pheromones.

27:06.372 --> 27:07.674
So, bees, like, send out alarm.

27:07.674 --> 27:08.675
Like, "Hey, somebody's going

27:08.675 --> 27:09.475
in."

27:09.475 --> 27:10.243
So just gonna...

27:10.243 --> 27:11.011
JON: Calm them down.

27:11.011 --> 27:11.845
DANIELLE: Yes, that's it.

27:11.845 --> 27:12.646
That's all it's gonna do.

27:12.646 --> 27:13.647

27:13.647 --> 27:14.648
DANIELLE: Wives?

27:14.648 --> 27:15.481
JON: ...wives?

27:15.481 --> 27:16.482

27:16.482 --> 27:18.484
That's actually a good idea.

27:18.484 --> 27:19.485

27:19.485 --> 27:20.486
DANIELLE: The bees in them

27:20.486 --> 27:22.856
are called a colony.

27:22.856 --> 27:23.990
See all that glistening

27:23.990 --> 27:25.526
substance in there?

27:25.526 --> 27:26.560
That's nectar that they're gonna

27:26.560 --> 27:27.561
turn into honey.

27:27.561 --> 27:28.562
Do you want to hold that?

27:28.562 --> 27:29.563
JON: Yeah, why not?

27:29.563 --> 27:30.496
DANIELLE: It's the...

27:30.496 --> 27:31.331
JON: Don't swat, Trin.

27:31.331 --> 27:32.165
What's wrong with you?

27:32.165 --> 27:32.933
TRINITY: I'm sorry, it's a

27:32.933 --> 27:33.700
natural reaction.

27:33.700 --> 27:34.467
I can't help it. (Bleep).

27:34.467 --> 27:35.235
JON: I'm standing right by

27:35.235 --> 27:36.069
you.

27:36.069 --> 27:37.070

27:37.070 --> 27:38.338

27:39.339 --> 27:40.340
just stand here when I hear the

27:40.340 --> 27:41.141
buzz.

27:41.141 --> 27:42.142
I don't want to get stung in my

27:42.142 --> 27:43.143
face.

27:43.143 --> 27:44.277
DANIELLE: All right, so,

27:44.277 --> 27:45.278

27:45.278 --> 27:46.179
you some honey.

27:46.179 --> 27:47.080
JON: It don't get no more

27:47.080 --> 27:47.948
natural than this.

27:47.948 --> 27:48.782
DANIELLE: Honey and maybe a

27:48.782 --> 27:49.783
drone.

27:49.783 --> 27:50.851
They are the biggest bee, so

27:50.851 --> 27:51.852
they are...

27:51.852 --> 27:52.653
JON: The drones are the

27:52.653 --> 27:53.419
biggest bees?

27:53.419 --> 27:54.420
DANIELLE: Yeah, the queen is

27:54.420 --> 27:55.656
long in length, and so I guess

27:55.656 --> 27:56.923
she's technically the biggest,

27:56.923 --> 27:57.924
but when you see a drone, you'll

27:57.924 --> 27:58.925
know.

27:58.925 --> 28:00.200
All right, you know how to get

28:00.200 --> 28:01.201
some peanut butter out of a

28:01.201 --> 28:02.035
peanut butter jar, right?

Jon, and in order to do that, I

28:09.776 --> 28:10.811

29:01.034 --> 29:02.435
RUSEV: <i>Eternity From You.</i>

29:02.435 --> 29:04.204
LANA: So, I hired a

29:04.204 --> 29:07.007
photographer who could take

29:07.007 --> 29:10.310
these pictures and, you know,

29:10.310 --> 29:12.746
create some buzz.

29:12.746 --> 29:13.947

29:13.947 --> 29:15.516

29:17.984 --> 29:18.752
Um, what is it?

29:18.752 --> 29:19.553
Eternity From You?

29:21.555 --> 29:22.388

29:22.388 --> 29:23.256

29:23.256 --> 29:24.257

29:24.257 --> 29:26.026
with the water crashing and...

29:33.800 --> 29:34.801

like, a nude bikini.

29:42.576 --> 29:43.577
You know, you'd have a nude

29:43.577 --> 29:44.878
bikini, and then we can send it

29:44.878 --> 29:45.879
out but have it blurred.

29:45.879 --> 29:46.880
RUSEV: I would need something

29:46.880 --> 29:48.248

41:32.566 --> 41:34.535
(Nattie groaning)

41:34.535 --> 41:37.070
(crowd groaning)

41:37.070 --> 41:39.640
ANNOUNCER: Oh, wait a minute.

41:39.640 --> 41:42.676
Natalya's friend Ronda Rousey.

41:42.676 --> 41:43.844
Ronda's here.

41:43.844 --> 41:45.278
NATTIE: To be closing <i>Raw</i>

41:45.278 --> 41:46.647
with such an epic match, and

41:46.647 --> 41:48.481
then to have Ronda coming to my

41:48.481 --> 41:50.283
rescue‐‐ it's so cool.

41:50.283 --> 41:51.918
It just makes me feel excited

41:51.918 --> 41:52.986
for what's to happen down the

41:52.986 --> 41:53.987
road.

41:53.987 --> 41:54.988
ANNOUNCER: Oh, look at

41:54.988 --> 41:55.989
Rousey!

41:55.989 --> 41:57.958
Oh. Wow.

41:57.958 --> 42:00.734
Into the armbar.

42:00.734 --> 42:02.803
(bell ringing)

42:05.371 --> 42:06.773
ANNOUNCER 2: Ronda Rousey

42:06.773 --> 42:08.909
just put on a display for the

42:08.909 --> 42:10.977
entire Raw women's division.

42:10.977 --> 42:13.880
How impressive was that.

42:13.880 --> 42:15.248
ANNOUNCER: What a main event

42:15.248 --> 42:16.517
on <i>Monday Night Raw!</i>

42:16.517 --> 42:17.718
ANNOUNCER 2: You mess with

42:17.718 --> 42:19.285
the baddest woman on the planet,

42:19.285 --> 42:21.054
there's a good chance your arm's

42:21.054 --> 42:22.723
getting broken.

42:22.723 --> 42:25.358
(crowd cheering)

42:25.358 --> 42:26.359
RONDA: Dude! I'm so excited.

42:26.359 --> 42:27.360
NATTIE: You did so good

42:27.360 --> 42:28.361
tonight.

42:28.361 --> 42:29.362
RONDA: Aw.

42:29.362 --> 42:30.363
NATTIE: I'm so excited, too.

42:30.363 --> 42:31.598
We're gonna do such good work.

42:31.598 --> 42:33.266
And tonight was, like, another

42:33.266 --> 42:34.267
block in our story.

42:34.267 --> 42:35.268
RONDA: Mm‐hmm.

42:35.268 --> 42:36.269
NATTIE: It was so (bleep)

42:36.269 --> 42:37.270
good.

42:37.270 --> 42:38.271
You know what it is?

42:38.271 --> 42:39.272
It's huge.

42:39.272 --> 42:40.741
(bleep) huge.

42:40.741 --> 42:43.910
I know. I know.

42:43.910 --> 42:44.911
RONDA: This is so crazy.

42:44.911 --> 42:45.579
NATTIE: It's surreal.

42:45.579 --> 42:46.312
RONDA: I cannot believe this.

42:46.312 --> 42:46.813
NATTIE: I know.

42:46.813 --> 42:47.548
I just couldn't believe that the

42:47.548 --> 42:48.281
end of the show was ending on

42:48.281 --> 42:49.282
us.

42:49.282 --> 42:50.283
RONDA: I know!

42:50.283 --> 42:51.117
NATTIE: You (bleep) did it.

42:51.117 --> 42:51.952
RONDA: Yeah.

42:51.952 --> 42:52.786
NATTIE: I'm telling you.

42:52.786 --> 42:53.587
RONDA: They were so stoked

42:53.587 --> 42:54.287
for you. Sorry.

42:54.287 --> 42:55.288
I just totally made you

42:55.288 --> 42:56.590
blink, huh? Oh!

42:56.590 --> 42:57.423
NATTIE: And, you know,

42:57.423 --> 42:58.692
everything... stayed in place.

42:58.692 --> 42:59.693
No wardrobe malfunction.

42:59.693 --> 43:00.701
RONDA: You ought to double

43:00.701 --> 43:01.501
patch that (bleep), you know

43:01.501 --> 43:02.502
what I mean?

43:02.502 --> 43:03.336
Just like an extra...

43:03.336 --> 43:04.337
NATTIE: Little...

43:04.337 --> 43:05.138
RONDA: An extra layer just in

43:05.138 --> 43:06.306
case.

43:06.306 --> 43:07.307
Team Rowdy Hart.

43:07.307 --> 43:08.374
NATTIE: Yeah.

43:08.374 --> 43:10.443
Yay!

43:11.111 --> 43:12.579
NIA: Next on Total Divas...

43:12.579 --> 43:13.346
TJ: I don't know about this

43:13.346 --> 43:14.548
barbecue.

43:14.548 --> 43:16.082
NATTIE: I've never seen my

43:16.082 --> 43:16.817
mom like this.

43:16.817 --> 43:17.551
(Ellie whoops)

43:17.551 --> 43:19.252
This whole night is ruined.

43:19.252 --> 43:20.320
PAIGE: I have a secret to

43:20.320 --> 43:20.954
confess.

43:20.954 --> 43:21.822
I like your pink undies.

43:21.822 --> 43:23.323
I feel guilty keeping it a

43:23.323 --> 43:24.424
secret from Nia because she is

43:24.424 --> 43:26.192
my best friend.

43:26.192 --> 43:26.893
Got it.

43:26.893 --> 43:27.794
BRYAN: It's the most

43:27.794 --> 43:29.696
nutrient‐dense source of food.

43:29.696 --> 43:30.697
BRIE: I tried to breastfeed

43:30.697 --> 43:32.065
her and I just had no milk.

43:32.065 --> 43:33.099
Motherhood doesn't prepare you

43:33.099 --> 43:33.867
for that.

43:33.867 --> 43:35.068
We're never gonna share that

43:35.068 --> 43:37.303
experience again.
