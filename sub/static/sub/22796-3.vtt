I don't like these

Hey, good afternoon.

00:59.309 --> 01:00.978
How are you doing?

01:01.061 --> 01:03.564
Hey. Checking in

01:01.061 --> 01:03.564
for Ricky, Julian and

01:01.061 --> 01:03.564
Bubbles for Swearnet.

01:03.647 --> 01:05.524
Okay.

01:05.607 --> 01:07.359
Oh, it looks like

01:05.607 --> 01:07.359
you were supposed to

01:05.607 --> 01:07.359
check in yesterday.

01:07.442 --> 01:10.362
Yeah, yeah, we know.

01:10.445 --> 01:12.531
Unfortunately we're all

01:10.445 --> 01:12.531
booked up for the night.

01:12.614 --> 01:13.949
Shall I see what's

01:12.614 --> 01:13.949
available close by?

01:14.033 --> 01:16.035
Ricky:

01:14.033 --> 01:16.035
Listen, fuck brains!

01:16.117 --> 01:18.119
If we checked in yesterday,

01:16.117 --> 01:18.119
what time would we have

01:16.117 --> 01:18.119
to leave here today?

01:18.203 --> 01:19.872
Clerk:

01:18.203 --> 01:19.872
11:00.

01:18.203 --> 01:19.872
And what time is it now?

01:19.955 --> 01:21.749
Hmm... 10:15.

01:21.832 --> 01:23.709
Okay, so we're checking in

01:21.832 --> 01:23.709
for 45 fucking minutes.

01:23.792 --> 01:26.045
We have a reservation. I just

01:23.792 --> 01:26.045
want to fucking go upstairs.

01:26.127 --> 01:27.629
My cock and balls are

01:26.127 --> 01:27.629
covered in lighter fluid,

01:27.713 --> 01:29.590
hopefully some dead crabs.

01:27.713 --> 01:29.590
I want to wash them off.

01:29.673 --> 01:32.175
Now I can do that here

01:29.673 --> 01:32.175
or I can go up to my

01:29.673 --> 01:32.175
room and fucking do it.

01:32.259 --> 01:34.929
But we have

01:32.259 --> 01:34.929
45 minutes, do we not?

01:35.012 --> 01:36.805
Yeah, yes sir, okay.

01:36.889 --> 01:38.807
So you want to check in

01:36.889 --> 01:38.807
and check back out

01:36.889 --> 01:38.807
in 45 minutes?

01:38.891 --> 01:40.809
Bingo!

01:40.893 --> 01:43.270
Yeah, okay, Ricky.

01:40.893 --> 01:43.270
Just be nicer.

01:43.353 --> 01:45.355
Is there a package

01:43.353 --> 01:45.355
that was left for us...

01:45.439 --> 01:47.357
Clerk: Let's see.

01:45.439 --> 01:47.357
...at least,

01:45.439 --> 01:47.357
like from Swearnet?

01:47.441 --> 01:48.943
Oh, yes, there is. Yeah.

01:50.277 --> 01:51.695
Bubbles:

01:50.277 --> 01:51.695
Oh, excellent. Oh, look boys,

01:51.779 --> 01:53.989
there's something

01:51.779 --> 01:53.989
with it this time.

01:51.779 --> 01:53.989
Mm-hmm.

01:54.073 --> 01:55.449
Decent.

01:54.073 --> 01:55.449
Anyway, I'm sorry.

01:55.532 --> 01:57.409
I haven't had a lot

01:55.532 --> 01:57.409
of fucking sleep.

01:57.492 --> 02:00.161
It's just really frustrating

01:57.492 --> 02:00.161
dealing with dumb,

01:57.492 --> 02:00.161
dumb fucking people

02:00.245 --> 02:01.789
and I'm sorry.

02:01.872 --> 02:05.375
Yeah, well... guys,

02:01.872 --> 02:05.375
you forgot y-your keys.

02:05.459 --> 02:07.210
Get the fucking keys.

02:11.882 --> 02:13.759
Okay, boys.

02:13.842 --> 02:16.177
(Elevator beeping)

02:13.842 --> 02:16.177
Room 725.

02:16.261 --> 02:18.221
I wonder what the

02:16.261 --> 02:18.221
fuck Swearnet's got

02:16.261 --> 02:18.221
lined up for us today,

02:18.305 --> 02:20.307
those fucking dicks!

02:20.390 --> 02:22.601
725.

02:22.684 --> 02:24.561
This way, boys.

02:22.684 --> 02:24.561
Let's see.

02:24.645 --> 02:26.605
No, no, no, no,

02:24.645 --> 02:26.605
it's this way.

02:24.645 --> 02:26.605
This is 720 here.

02:26.688 --> 02:28.398
That's going down,

02:26.688 --> 02:28.398
this is going up.

02:28.482 --> 02:30.067
Ricky:

02:28.482 --> 02:30.067
They're going down

02:28.482 --> 02:30.067
this way, though.

02:30.150 --> 02:31.777
It's...

02:30.150 --> 02:31.777
But it's 725, Ricky.

02:31.860 --> 02:33.862
This is 20.

02:31.860 --> 02:33.862
Oh, my fuck...

02:33.946 --> 02:37.365
So, if they're going down,

02:33.946 --> 02:37.365
then this has to be going up.

02:33.946 --> 02:37.365
(Sigh)

02:37.449 --> 02:39.326
That's, I believe,

02:37.449 --> 02:39.326
how hotels work.

02:39.409 --> 02:41.078
722, see?

02:41.161 --> 02:43.538
God, I can't wait to

02:41.161 --> 02:43.538
shine up my cock and balls.

02:41.161 --> 02:43.538
721.

02:43.622 --> 02:45.791
Julian:

02:43.622 --> 02:45.791
724.

02:45.874 --> 02:47.793
723.

02:45.874 --> 02:47.793
Perfect!

02:47.876 --> 02:49.503
So we are going

02:47.876 --> 02:49.503
the right direction.

02:49.586 --> 02:51.046
You guys want

02:49.586 --> 02:51.046
some soap?

02:52.589 --> 02:54.299
Ricky...

02:54.382 --> 02:56.175
there's going to be

02:54.382 --> 02:56.175
soap in the room.

02:59.138 --> 03:00.889
100 bucks says

02:59.138 --> 03:00.889
it's one bed.

03:00.973 --> 03:03.100
Bubbles:

03:00.973 --> 03:03.100
Yeah, there is one bed.

03:03.182 --> 03:04.977
It's better than

03:03.182 --> 03:04.977
any bed I had on the

03:03.182 --> 03:04.977
trip you organized...

03:05.060 --> 03:06.854
Julian:

03:05.060 --> 03:06.854
Yeah, whatever.

03:05.060 --> 03:06.854
All right.

03:06.937 --> 03:09.397
What do those

03:06.937 --> 03:09.397
Swearnet bastards

03:06.937 --> 03:09.397
have us doing today?

03:09.481 --> 03:10.691
Let me see.

03:13.694 --> 03:15.779
(Sigh)

03:13.694 --> 03:15.779
There's only...

03:15.863 --> 03:17.698
Oh, there's only one task.

03:17.781 --> 03:22.036
"One of you needs to

03:17.781 --> 03:22.036
reach a ground speed

03:17.781 --> 03:22.036
of 200 miles per hour,

03:22.119 --> 03:25.039
using the included

03:22.119 --> 03:25.039
radar gun as proof."

03:25.122 --> 03:27.541
That's a radar gun.

03:25.122 --> 03:27.541
Cool!

03:25.122 --> 03:27.541
1,500 bucks.

03:27.624 --> 03:30.585
Nice!

03:27.624 --> 03:30.585
It's not nice, Ricky.

03:30.669 --> 03:32.504
It's only one task,

03:30.669 --> 03:32.504
one option,

03:32.587 --> 03:34.173
and it's fucking

03:32.587 --> 03:34.173
pretty much impossible.

03:34.255 --> 03:36.257
Why?

03:34.255 --> 03:36.257
200 miles an...

03:36.341 --> 03:38.218
Do you know how

03:36.341 --> 03:38.218
fucking fast that is?

03:38.301 --> 03:40.929
How are we going

03:38.301 --> 03:40.929
to do that?

03:41.013 --> 03:42.681
Bungee jump.

03:42.764 --> 03:44.850
Bungee... Ricky,

03:44.933 --> 03:47.686
you wouldn't get anywhere

03:44.933 --> 03:47.686
near 200 miles an hour

03:44.933 --> 03:47.686
bungee jumping.

03:47.769 --> 03:50.064
You'd have to jump out

03:47.769 --> 03:50.064
of a fucking airplane

03:47.769 --> 03:50.064
at 30,000 feet

03:50.147 --> 03:51.773
and go into a tucker.

03:51.857 --> 03:54.068
Yeah, and who's going

03:51.857 --> 03:54.068
to fucking jump

03:51.857 --> 03:54.068
out of an airplane?

03:54.151 --> 03:55.861
Me. I'd love to jump out

03:54.151 --> 03:55.861
of a fucking airplane.

03:55.944 --> 03:58.363
You would die

03:55.944 --> 03:58.363
if you jumped out of

03:55.944 --> 03:58.363
a fucking airplane.

03:58.446 --> 04:00.365
Well, there's got

03:58.446 --> 04:00.365
to be ways to do it.

03:58.446 --> 04:00.365
Like a fucking...

04:00.448 --> 04:02.283
steal one of those

04:00.448 --> 04:02.283
fucking trains that goes

04:00.448 --> 04:02.283
faster than a bullet.

04:02.367 --> 04:03.827
What are they called?

04:03.911 --> 04:05.328
They're called

04:03.911 --> 04:05.328
bullet trains, Ricky.

04:05.412 --> 04:07.206
But they're in

04:05.412 --> 04:07.206
fucking Japan.

04:07.288 --> 04:09.374
They don't have bullet

04:07.288 --> 04:09.374
trains in Charlotte.

04:09.457 --> 04:12.460
This is fucked.

04:09.457 --> 04:12.460
What about a boat?

04:12.544 --> 04:15.255
A boat, a 200 mile

04:12.544 --> 04:15.255
an hour boat.

04:15.338 --> 04:17.799
Or a fast cat,

04:15.338 --> 04:17.799
like a cheetah or

04:15.338 --> 04:17.799
something like that.

04:17.883 --> 04:19.760
Just get on it and

04:17.883 --> 04:19.760
ride it like a horse.

04:19.843 --> 04:21.762
This is fucking

04:19.843 --> 04:21.762
impossible.

04:19.843 --> 04:21.762
Or a bunch of ball...

04:21.845 --> 04:23.513
That's what we'll do.

04:21.845 --> 04:23.513
We get a bunch

04:21.845 --> 04:23.513
of balloons.

04:23.597 --> 04:25.640
They'll float

04:23.597 --> 04:25.640
one of us up,

04:25.724 --> 04:27.726
That's not going to

04:25.724 --> 04:27.726
fucking happen.

04:25.724 --> 04:27.726
we'll pop them, go into a tuck.

04:27.809 --> 04:29.686
You'd have to land

04:27.809 --> 04:29.686
on the floor...

04:27.809 --> 04:29.686
Nice going, Bubs!

04:29.770 --> 04:31.688
Nice fucking going.

04:29.770 --> 04:31.688
Oh, this is my fault.

04:31.772 --> 04:33.648
This is my fucking fault?

04:31.772 --> 04:33.648
Whose fault is it?

04:33.732 --> 04:35.567
Well, not mine!

04:33.732 --> 04:35.567
You're the big

04:33.732 --> 04:35.567
negotiator.

04:35.650 --> 04:37.402
Well, it's a lot better

04:35.650 --> 04:37.402
than the fucking one

04:37.485 --> 04:39.362
you negotiated...

04:37.485 --> 04:39.362
Oh, bullshit!

04:39.446 --> 04:41.489
Why do we keep having

04:39.446 --> 04:41.489
to fucking talk about

04:39.446 --> 04:41.489
the other fucking trip?

04:41.573 --> 04:44.243
Because you...

04:41.573 --> 04:44.243
(Mixed arguing)

04:44.325 --> 04:45.911
...Patrick Swayze.

04:45.994 --> 04:48.247
Don't call me P...

04:45.994 --> 04:48.247
Ughhh!

04:48.329 --> 04:50.373
Listen, you twat waffles.

04:48.329 --> 04:50.373
Here's what's

04:48.329 --> 04:50.373
going to happen.

04:50.457 --> 04:52.709
I'm going to go in there.

04:50.457 --> 04:52.709
I'm going to shine up

04:50.457 --> 04:52.709
my cock and balls,

04:52.793 --> 04:55.503
make them look fucking

04:52.793 --> 04:55.503
beautiful and smelling

04:52.793 --> 04:55.503
great. No crabs.

04:55.587 --> 04:57.756
And then we're going

04:55.587 --> 04:57.756
to go do this somehow.

04:55.587 --> 04:57.756
We'll figure it out.

04:57.839 --> 04:59.466
But I promise you today,

04:59.549 --> 05:01.218
we're making 1500

04:59.549 --> 05:01.218
fucking dollars.

05:02.761 --> 05:04.345
Do you want to

05:02.761 --> 05:04.345
come in with me?

05:04.429 --> 05:06.306
Fuck off. Just go scrape

05:04.429 --> 05:06.306
the crabs off your body.

05:06.389 --> 05:08.183
I need one of you to fucking

05:06.389 --> 05:08.183
make sure they're gone.

05:08.267 --> 05:09.935
I can't see down there.

05:08.267 --> 05:09.935
It's too fucking hard.

05:10.018 --> 05:11.436
I can't get

05:10.018 --> 05:11.436
into the right shape.

05:13.897 --> 05:15.732
Fucking gross, man.

05:15.816 --> 05:18.110
If one of us is

05:15.816 --> 05:18.110
going, it's you.

05:15.816 --> 05:18.110
You go examine it.

05:18.193 --> 05:19.778
I'm not touching

05:18.193 --> 05:19.778
any fucking crabs.

05:19.861 --> 05:22.156
You go examine

05:19.861 --> 05:22.156
his... penis.

05:22.239 --> 05:23.991
Ricky:

05:22.239 --> 05:23.991
All right, I'm naked, boys.

05:24.074 --> 05:25.784
Bubbles:

05:24.074 --> 05:25.784
What?

05:24.074 --> 05:25.784
I'm naked. Come on in.

05:26.994 --> 05:29.079
Please! I'll cover my cock.

05:29.163 --> 05:30.998
There's no fucking way

05:29.163 --> 05:30.998
this is going to work,

05:31.081 --> 05:32.624
just for the record.

05:32.707 --> 05:34.459
No, they're not just going

05:32.707 --> 05:34.459
to lend us a fucking car.

05:34.542 --> 05:36.253
Ricky, you've just

05:34.542 --> 05:36.253
got to deal with

05:34.542 --> 05:36.253
these people

05:36.335 --> 05:37.754
like you deal

05:36.335 --> 05:37.754
with cops, okay?

05:36.335 --> 05:37.754
It'll be easy.

05:37.838 --> 05:39.506
They're not cops.

05:39.589 --> 05:42.217
Yeah, they're used car

05:39.589 --> 05:42.217
fucking salesmen,

05:39.589 --> 05:42.217
they're greasy.

05:42.301 --> 05:44.385
Look, boys, you make

05:42.301 --> 05:44.385
them believe that

05:42.301 --> 05:44.385
I'm rich, okay?

05:44.469 --> 05:46.763
That I want to buy

05:44.469 --> 05:46.763
a car, but I want to

05:44.469 --> 05:46.763
test drive it first.

05:46.847 --> 05:48.932
They'll be begging

05:46.847 --> 05:48.932
me to fucking

05:46.847 --> 05:48.932
test drive a car.

05:49.016 --> 05:51.726
Why are they going

05:49.016 --> 05:51.726
to think we're rich?

05:49.016 --> 05:51.726
Look at us.

05:51.810 --> 05:54.562
Boys, just say I'm

05:51.810 --> 05:54.562
a fucking celebrity

05:51.810 --> 05:54.562
or something, okay?

05:54.646 --> 05:56.273
Just something.

05:54.646 --> 05:56.273
I've got lots of money.

05:56.355 --> 05:58.025
It's gonna work!

05:58.108 --> 05:59.693
Yeah. We'll see.

05:58.108 --> 05:59.693
If it does,

05:59.776 --> 06:01.528
we're fucking taking

05:59.776 --> 06:01.528
this thing, an SS.

06:01.611 --> 06:03.071
Super speed!

06:03.155 --> 06:05.157
This wouldn't go

06:03.155 --> 06:05.157
200 miles an hour, Ricky.

06:05.240 --> 06:06.783
It might.

06:06.867 --> 06:08.660
This thing?

06:06.867 --> 06:08.660
There's no way.

06:08.743 --> 06:10.871
If you find a big

06:08.743 --> 06:10.871
fucking hill or

06:08.743 --> 06:10.871
something it would.

06:10.954 --> 06:12.789
Ricky if you could

06:10.954 --> 06:12.789
get this going 200,

06:12.873 --> 06:14.541
you would not

06:12.873 --> 06:14.541
want to be in it.

06:14.624 --> 06:16.335
It was made in the '60s.

06:16.417 --> 06:18.503
It would blow apart

06:16.417 --> 06:18.503
at the fucking seams!

06:18.586 --> 06:21.006
All right, let's go talk

06:18.586 --> 06:21.006
to somebody inside here.

06:18.586 --> 06:21.006
This is fucked.

06:21.089 --> 06:24.092
Do you have any

06:21.089 --> 06:24.092
idea how fast 200

06:21.089 --> 06:24.092
miles an hour is?

06:24.176 --> 06:25.510
No.

06:28.013 --> 06:30.640
Here, you guys follow us.

06:28.013 --> 06:30.640
Maybe we'll look famous.

06:31.683 --> 06:33.601
Julian:

06:31.683 --> 06:33.601
Just don't take

06:31.683 --> 06:33.601
no for an answer.

06:33.685 --> 06:36.146
Well, this is definitely

06:33.685 --> 06:36.146
the right fucking place.

06:36.230 --> 06:38.065
Boys, I don't know

06:36.230 --> 06:38.065
a lot about cars.

06:38.148 --> 06:39.774
Like how do you

06:38.148 --> 06:39.774
tell which ones do

06:38.148 --> 06:39.774
200 miles an hour?

06:39.858 --> 06:42.236
Well, Ricky,

06:39.858 --> 06:42.236
none of these are

06:39.858 --> 06:42.236
going to go 200.

06:42.319 --> 06:44.821
Those are muscle cars,

06:42.319 --> 06:44.821
boys. We're looking

06:42.319 --> 06:44.821
on the wrong side.

06:44.905 --> 06:46.907
If they call them

06:44.905 --> 06:46.907
muscle cars, shouldn't

06:44.905 --> 06:46.907
they fucking do 200?

06:46.990 --> 06:49.117
Bubbles:

06:46.990 --> 06:49.117
Every car he's in

06:46.990 --> 06:49.117
is a muscle car.

06:49.201 --> 06:52.371
Here you go.

06:49.201 --> 06:52.371
This thing definitely

06:49.201 --> 06:52.371
does 200 miles an hour.

06:52.453 --> 06:54.289
Check that out.

06:52.453 --> 06:54.289
It's a spaceship.

06:54.373 --> 06:56.624
That's not gonna go 200.

06:56.708 --> 06:58.919
I mean, that's

06:56.708 --> 06:58.919
a fast car, but...

06:56.708 --> 06:58.919
A Pors... a Pors-he.

06:59.002 --> 07:00.545
No, it's a Porsche,

06:59.002 --> 07:00.545
and it's a turbo.

07:00.628 --> 07:02.797
So, this probably

07:00.628 --> 07:02.797
does go 200.

07:02.881 --> 07:05.508
There's no way, Julian.

07:02.881 --> 07:05.508
It's a 4-door family car.

07:05.592 --> 07:07.219
It's a fucking

07:05.592 --> 07:07.219
Porsche.

07:07.302 --> 07:08.803
I know, but just

07:07.302 --> 07:08.803
'cause it's a Porsche

07:08.887 --> 07:10.722
doesn't mean it goes 200.

07:10.805 --> 07:12.682
(Whispering)

07:10.805 --> 07:12.682
Here she comes.

07:10.805 --> 07:12.682
Hi, y'all!

07:12.766 --> 07:13.975
Oh, hi there.

07:14.059 --> 07:15.476
How are you?

07:14.059 --> 07:15.476
I'm Carlita.

07:15.560 --> 07:17.645
Uh, Randy

07:15.560 --> 07:17.645
Mc... Laheyson.

07:17.729 --> 07:20.315
Randy.

07:17.729 --> 07:20.315
Hi, uh,

07:20.399 --> 07:23.068
Greg

07:20.399 --> 07:23.068
Glimmer... son... ford.

07:23.151 --> 07:25.028
Hi, Greg.

07:23.151 --> 07:25.028
So nice to meet you.

07:25.112 --> 07:26.780
How can I help

07:25.112 --> 07:26.780
y'all today?

07:26.863 --> 07:28.949
Um, we are...

07:26.863 --> 07:28.949
Tell her.

07:26.863 --> 07:28.949
Tell her, Greg.

07:29.032 --> 07:32.327
We are here to

07:29.032 --> 07:32.327
make a purchase.

07:29.032 --> 07:32.327
Mm-hmm.

07:32.411 --> 07:34.121
If you... I don't

07:32.411 --> 07:34.121
know if you noticed

07:34.204 --> 07:36.539
who's with us over

07:34.204 --> 07:36.539
there, but that is...

07:36.623 --> 07:39.626
You might recognize him

07:36.623 --> 07:39.626
from the action film genre.

07:39.709 --> 07:41.420
Ohhh...

07:41.502 --> 07:43.671
Very, very famous.

07:41.502 --> 07:43.671
Very, very rich as well.

07:43.755 --> 07:45.424
Well, what was his name?

07:45.506 --> 07:48.009
Uhh, Steven...

07:48.093 --> 07:49.803
uh, Van Schwarzendiesel.

07:50.511 --> 07:52.513
Oh, yes!

07:50.511 --> 07:52.513
The Halifax Hunk?

07:52.597 --> 07:54.766
I have heard of him.

07:52.597 --> 07:54.766
How exciting!

07:54.849 --> 07:56.768
Bubbles:

07:54.849 --> 07:56.768
Yes, there he is.

07:54.849 --> 07:56.768
That's him...

07:54.849 --> 07:56.768
Wow!

07:56.851 --> 07:58.812
Ricky:

07:56.851 --> 07:58.812
That's the Hunk right

07:56.851 --> 07:58.812
there, in person.

07:58.895 --> 08:01.022
Okay!

07:58.895 --> 08:01.022
So he is, um,

08:01.106 --> 08:02.649
he's looking to buy a car.

08:02.732 --> 08:04.859
He likes to pay cash.

08:02.732 --> 08:04.859
All right.

08:04.943 --> 08:06.945
(Whispering)

08:04.943 --> 08:06.945
He's very wealthy.

08:04.943 --> 08:06.945
Okay.

08:07.028 --> 08:08.696
Um, but he's a bit

08:07.028 --> 08:08.696
of a speed freak, so...

08:08.780 --> 08:10.865
It has to go at least

08:08.780 --> 08:10.865
200 miles per hour.

08:10.949 --> 08:12.826
Two... Okay.

08:12.909 --> 08:14.619
What would be the fastest

08:12.909 --> 08:14.619
car on the premises?

08:14.702 --> 08:16.455
This here?

08:14.702 --> 08:16.455
This?

08:16.537 --> 08:19.082
Actually, I would

08:16.537 --> 08:19.082
probably go with the

08:16.537 --> 08:19.082
Corvette down here.

08:19.166 --> 08:20.583
Ricky:

08:19.166 --> 08:20.583
The Corvette?

08:20.667 --> 08:22.585
Carlita:

08:20.667 --> 08:22.585
Mm-hmm. This baby's beautiful.

08:22.669 --> 08:24.254
750 horsepower.

08:24.338 --> 08:26.589
Supercharged.

08:24.338 --> 08:26.589
Meth injection.

08:26.673 --> 08:28.842
So that will do

08:26.673 --> 08:28.842
200, you believe?

08:28.925 --> 08:31.303
Absolutely.

08:28.925 --> 08:31.303
I wouldn't recommend it,

08:28.925 --> 08:31.303
but you could, yeah.

08:31.386 --> 08:33.096
Okay.

08:33.180 --> 08:35.432
Uh, Mr...

08:33.180 --> 08:35.432
Schwarzendiesel,

08:35.515 --> 08:37.309
that one there

08:35.515 --> 08:37.309
will go 200.

08:37.392 --> 08:39.894
All right. It's a bit old,

08:37.392 --> 08:39.894
but I like it.

08:39.978 --> 08:42.647
I'm going to have to take it

08:39.978 --> 08:42.647
out for a little rip, though.

08:42.730 --> 08:44.274
Yes, okay.

08:42.730 --> 08:44.274
Um, yeah, okay.

08:44.358 --> 08:45.942
He likes that one.

08:46.026 --> 08:48.736
He's gonna... he's gonna

08:46.026 --> 08:48.736
buy it with cash money.

08:48.820 --> 08:51.448
We just need to take it

08:48.820 --> 08:51.448
for a little spin.

08:51.531 --> 08:53.074
So if you could

08:51.531 --> 08:53.074
procure the keys,

08:53.158 --> 08:55.202
we can get this

08:53.158 --> 08:55.202
transaction underway.

08:55.285 --> 08:56.953
Sure, absolutely.

08:57.037 --> 08:59.456
I just need two pieces

08:57.037 --> 08:59.456
of government-issued ID

08:59.539 --> 09:01.333
and a credit card.

09:01.416 --> 09:04.002
Uh, what does

09:01.416 --> 09:04.002
that mean exactly?

09:04.085 --> 09:06.087
Oh, uh, we need to

09:04.085 --> 09:06.087
take a little deposit,

09:06.171 --> 09:08.006
just to make sure

09:06.171 --> 09:08.006
everything's above board.

09:08.089 --> 09:10.800
How much, uh,

09:08.089 --> 09:10.800
how much is that?

09:08.089 --> 09:10.800
Oh, just 10,000.

09:10.884 --> 09:13.011
Oh, well, see,

09:10.884 --> 09:13.011
he's... I mean.

09:13.094 --> 09:15.180
Him being a celebrity,

09:13.094 --> 09:15.180
you know what they're like.

09:15.263 --> 09:17.557
He gets offended

09:15.263 --> 09:17.557
because he's paying cash.

09:17.640 --> 09:20.935
Maybe we could just

09:17.640 --> 09:20.935
bypass that, you know?

09:17.640 --> 09:20.935
(Tongue clicking)

09:21.019 --> 09:22.979
No. Unfortunately

09:21.019 --> 09:22.979
those are the rules.

09:23.063 --> 09:25.148
So this is the

09:23.063 --> 09:25.148
only way to do it?

09:23.063 --> 09:25.148
Okay, Steven,

09:25.232 --> 09:27.150
we're going to need your

09:25.232 --> 09:27.150
credit card. The one with

09:25.232 --> 09:27.150
the no limit there,

09:27.234 --> 09:29.069
just to, put a

09:27.234 --> 09:29.069
little deposit.

09:27.234 --> 09:29.069
...you guys deal with that.

09:29.152 --> 09:30.529
You guys deal with that...

09:30.611 --> 09:32.406
Ricky:

09:30.611 --> 09:32.406
No... That's the only

09:30.611 --> 09:32.406
way to do it.

09:32.489 --> 09:34.533
No, you're fucking

09:32.489 --> 09:34.533
embarrassing me

09:32.489 --> 09:34.533
right now.

09:34.615 --> 09:36.159
Uh, Mr. Van Schwarzendiesel?

09:36.243 --> 09:37.994
We need the card,

09:38.078 --> 09:40.038
or we can't take

09:38.078 --> 09:40.038
the fucking car

09:38.078 --> 09:40.038
and make the $1500...

09:40.121 --> 09:42.541
Mr. Laheyson,

09:40.121 --> 09:42.541
let me, maybe...

09:42.623 --> 09:44.334
Look, he's, you know,

09:42.623 --> 09:44.334
obviously he's...

09:44.418 --> 09:46.211
(Whispering)

09:44.418 --> 09:46.211
I don't want

09:44.418 --> 09:46.211
to get fired.

09:46.294 --> 09:48.171
What's the big deal?

09:46.294 --> 09:48.171
It's fucking got

09:46.294 --> 09:48.171
no limit...

09:48.255 --> 09:50.131
Just give us the fuck...

09:48.255 --> 09:50.131
Get the fuck over here!

09:52.133 --> 09:53.927
You need a...

09:52.133 --> 09:53.927
(Sigh)

09:54.010 --> 09:55.803
You fucking kidding me?

09:54.010 --> 09:55.803
Bubbles:

09:54.010 --> 09:55.803
He's the Halifax Hunk.

09:55.887 --> 09:57.638
I know. Perfect.

09:57.722 --> 09:59.099
I'll go swipe this and

09:57.722 --> 09:59.099
be right back, y'all.

09:59.182 --> 10:01.101
Perfect. That's

09:59.182 --> 10:01.101
how you fucking

09:59.182 --> 10:01.101
deal with that.

10:01.184 --> 10:03.395
What the fuck are you doing?

10:01.184 --> 10:03.395
I didn't want to give

10:01.184 --> 10:03.395
them my fucking card.

10:03.478 --> 10:05.397
It's the only way we

10:03.478 --> 10:05.397
can take the car out.

10:03.478 --> 10:05.397
Yeah, but...

10:05.480 --> 10:07.399
I don't know the limit

10:05.480 --> 10:07.399
on that fucking thing.

10:07.482 --> 10:09.817
I thought you said

10:07.482 --> 10:09.817
it had no limit.

10:07.482 --> 10:09.817
10,000, Ricky?

10:09.901 --> 10:12.529
Ricky, do you know

10:09.901 --> 10:12.529
who has credit cards

10:09.901 --> 10:12.529
with $10,000 limits?

10:12.612 --> 10:14.072
Fucking millionaires!

10:14.155 --> 10:16.366
Or the fucking

10:14.155 --> 10:16.366
Incredible Hunk.

10:16.450 --> 10:18.701
He's not really

10:16.450 --> 10:18.701
him, though.

10:18.785 --> 10:21.662
What was the name

10:18.785 --> 10:21.662
that you said was

10:18.785 --> 10:21.662
supposed to be on here?

10:21.746 --> 10:23.831
Uh, Steven...

10:23.915 --> 10:26.667
Oh, uh, this is,

10:23.915 --> 10:26.667
this is his real...

10:23.915 --> 10:26.667
Schwarzendiesel.

10:26.751 --> 10:28.836
This is his real name.

10:26.751 --> 10:28.836
Ohhh!

10:28.920 --> 10:31.714
'Cause, you know,

10:28.920 --> 10:31.714
he has to obviously,

10:28.920 --> 10:31.714
stay, you know...

10:31.798 --> 10:33.258
Okay.

10:31.798 --> 10:33.258
But don't tell anybody.

10:33.341 --> 10:35.260
I won't.

10:33.341 --> 10:35.260
But unfortunately,

10:35.343 --> 10:38.096
this card only

10:35.343 --> 10:38.096
has a $1000 limit

10:38.179 --> 10:40.056
and it's maxed out.

10:40.140 --> 10:42.350
$1000, Steven?

10:40.140 --> 10:42.350
Seriously? That's

10:40.140 --> 10:42.350
all you have?

10:42.434 --> 10:44.394
There's something wrong

10:42.434 --> 10:44.394
with your machine.

10:44.478 --> 10:46.687
Yeah, and it's

10:44.478 --> 10:46.687
actually saying

10:44.478 --> 10:46.687
I should cut it up.

10:46.771 --> 10:48.689
Oh no, um, oh.

10:46.771 --> 10:48.689
This is not the...

10:48.773 --> 10:50.567
This is your...

10:48.773 --> 10:50.567
That's the, not the...

10:50.650 --> 10:52.986
'Member the other card

10:50.650 --> 10:52.986
was a different colour.

10:53.069 --> 10:55.280
Okay, where's the

10:53.069 --> 10:55.280
other card then? Huh?

10:53.069 --> 10:55.280
Ricky: It's just a baby card.

10:55.363 --> 10:56.864
This is...

10:55.363 --> 10:56.864
Well, you probably...

10:56.948 --> 10:58.450
I don't have

10:56.948 --> 10:58.450
a wallet, okay?

10:58.533 --> 11:01.119
Okay, so we'll

10:58.533 --> 11:01.119
just go maybe,

11:01.202 --> 11:02.829
maybe get the cash

11:01.202 --> 11:02.829
and bring it?

11:02.912 --> 11:04.747
No.

11:02.912 --> 11:04.747
Just hold the fuck on!

11:04.831 --> 11:07.041
So you're not going

11:04.831 --> 11:07.041
to let us take a test

11:04.831 --> 11:07.041
drive for 20 minutes?

11:07.125 --> 11:09.669
Sorry.

11:07.125 --> 11:09.669
Well, maybe I'll take

11:07.125 --> 11:09.669
a test piss then instead

11:09.752 --> 11:12.464
all over this

11:09.752 --> 11:12.464
fucking Porsche.

11:09.752 --> 11:12.464
No, no, Cory! Mr...

11:12.547 --> 11:14.466
No. I think y'all

11:12.547 --> 11:14.466
are full of shit.

11:14.549 --> 11:16.968
I'm going to have

11:14.549 --> 11:16.968
to go ahead and

11:14.549 --> 11:16.968
call the police

11:17.051 --> 11:19.220
if you don't go ahead

11:17.051 --> 11:19.220
and leave right now.

11:17.051 --> 11:19.220
No, no, don't call the police.

11:19.304 --> 11:21.556
Don't call the police.

11:19.304 --> 11:21.556
Mr. Schwarzendiesel,

11:21.640 --> 11:23.558
we've got to get you

11:21.640 --> 11:23.558
out of here, sir.

11:23.642 --> 11:25.519
This... This is rude.

11:25.602 --> 11:27.103
This is fucking

11:25.602 --> 11:27.103
embarrassing.

11:27.187 --> 11:28.605
He's a huge fucking

11:27.187 --> 11:28.605
Canadian celebrity

11:28.687 --> 11:29.897
and just being

11:28.687 --> 11:29.897
treated like shit.

11:29.981 --> 11:31.690
No fucking test

11:29.981 --> 11:31.690
drives, nothing.

11:31.774 --> 11:34.819
Ricky: Ram your richy-type

11:31.774 --> 11:34.819
cars right up your

11:31.774 --> 11:34.819
hot southern ass!

11:36.946 --> 11:39.199
Nice fucking fancy card

11:36.946 --> 11:39.199
you got there, Julian.

11:39.282 --> 11:41.742
Would you shut

11:39.282 --> 11:41.742
the fuck up? This

11:39.282 --> 11:41.742
isn't my fault.

11:41.826 --> 11:44.120
Mr. "Ooh I'm going

11:41.826 --> 11:44.120
to make all kinds

11:41.826 --> 11:44.120
of money, I promise"!

11:44.204 --> 11:46.164
It's not my fucking fault.

11:44.204 --> 11:46.164
This is your fault.

11:46.247 --> 11:48.208
It's not my fault.

11:46.247 --> 11:48.208
You fucking planned the

11:46.247 --> 11:48.208
whole goddamned trip.

11:48.291 --> 11:50.001
Just shut up.

11:48.291 --> 11:50.001
You shut the fuck up.

11:50.084 --> 11:51.670
...how to go

11:50.084 --> 11:51.670
200 miles an hour.

11:51.752 --> 11:54.464
We should have taken

11:51.752 --> 11:54.464
the goddamn 5 grand.

11:51.752 --> 11:54.464
Yeah, no shit.

11:54.548 --> 11:55.965
What the fuck is that?

11:58.468 --> 12:00.053
What the fuck is

11:58.468 --> 12:00.053
that doing here?

12:00.136 --> 12:02.096
That's the movie car.

12:02.180 --> 12:03.682
That's from the movie.

12:03.764 --> 12:05.808
It's a replica.

12:03.764 --> 12:05.808
Look at that.

12:05.892 --> 12:07.726
It's fucking cool,

12:05.892 --> 12:07.726
but there's no way

12:05.892 --> 12:07.726
we could use that.

12:07.810 --> 12:09.604
You wouldn't be able

12:07.810 --> 12:09.604
to steal it anyway.

12:09.688 --> 12:11.314
Really?

12:11.398 --> 12:13.316
10 bucks says you can't

12:11.398 --> 12:13.316
steal this fucking thing.

12:13.400 --> 12:15.402
10 bucks says you

12:13.400 --> 12:15.402
can't suck my cock.

12:15.485 --> 12:16.861
All right, it's on.

12:16.944 --> 12:21.575
(Engine roaring)

12:21.658 --> 12:22.867
I don't know about

12:21.658 --> 12:22.867
this, Julian, man.

12:22.950 --> 12:24.452
What if we fucking

12:22.950 --> 12:24.452
get up to the future

12:24.536 --> 12:26.663
or back in the past

12:24.536 --> 12:26.663
in this fucking thing?

12:26.745 --> 12:28.831
Ricky, that was just

12:26.745 --> 12:28.831
a fucking movie. That's

12:26.745 --> 12:28.831
not going to happen.

12:28.915 --> 12:31.418
This is a fucking

12:28.915 --> 12:31.418
real thing. Look at it.

12:36.256 --> 12:37.924
Screen's not very bright.

12:38.966 --> 12:40.510
Julian:

12:38.966 --> 12:40.510
All right, 70,

12:40.594 --> 12:42.387
75,

12:42.470 --> 12:45.724
80, 84.

12:45.806 --> 12:48.476
Come on, pump that

12:45.806 --> 12:48.476
big, muscular foot.

12:48.560 --> 12:50.270
Come on, Julian.

12:50.353 --> 12:52.606
(Engine decelerating)

12:50.353 --> 12:52.606
What the fuck is going on?

12:52.689 --> 12:54.232
Oh, my fuck, I knew it.

12:54.315 --> 12:56.067
Oh, for fuck's sakes!

12:54.315 --> 12:56.067
Julian:

12:54.315 --> 12:56.067
Just cut out.

12:56.150 --> 12:58.069
Now we're up in

12:56.150 --> 12:58.069
the fucking future

12:58.152 --> 12:59.862
or back in the fucking

12:58.152 --> 12:59.862
past or something.

12:59.946 --> 13:02.282
Great.

12:59.946 --> 13:02.282
We're not in

12:59.946 --> 13:02.282
the past, Ricky.

13:02.365 --> 13:03.782
Where are we?

13:02.365 --> 13:03.782
What are you doing?

13:03.866 --> 13:05.410
Are we in the fucking

13:03.866 --> 13:05.410
past or the future now?

13:05.493 --> 13:07.746
No, we're not.

13:05.493 --> 13:07.746
Dick balls hit 88.

13:07.828 --> 13:09.914
Yeah, and it just

13:07.828 --> 13:09.914
cut out man.

13:09.997 --> 13:11.374
The thing's fucked!

13:09.997 --> 13:11.374
It cut out at 88?

13:11.458 --> 13:13.000
Yeah, it's fucked up.

13:13.084 --> 13:15.086
Fuck's sakes!

13:13.084 --> 13:15.086
I wonder where we are.

13:15.169 --> 13:17.130
What are you talking

13:15.169 --> 13:17.130
about, Ricky?

13:15.169 --> 13:17.130
We're here.

13:17.213 --> 13:18.881
It's fucking not real.

13:18.965 --> 13:20.841
All right, we've got

13:18.965 --> 13:20.841
to regroup, boys.

13:18.965 --> 13:20.841
(Siren blip)

13:20.925 --> 13:23.386
Holy fuck, boys!

13:20.925 --> 13:23.386
Cops. Into the woods,

13:20.925 --> 13:23.386
let's go! Come on!

13:23.470 --> 13:25.263
Fuck's sakes.

13:23.470 --> 13:25.263
Bubbles:

13:23.470 --> 13:25.263
Oh my God...

13:25.346 --> 13:26.306
(Grunting)

13:27.181 --> 13:28.849
Ricky:

13:27.181 --> 13:28.849
Hey Bubs, keep

13:27.181 --> 13:28.849
those feet moving!

13:28.933 --> 13:30.977
Julian:

13:28.933 --> 13:30.977
Bubs, you've got to keep up!

13:31.060 --> 13:33.772
Bubbles: I'm fucking

13:31.060 --> 13:33.772
keeping up! I can't see!

13:31.060 --> 13:33.772
(Siren wailing)

13:33.854 --> 13:35.814
Ricky:

13:33.854 --> 13:35.814
Turn off the fucking camera,

13:33.854 --> 13:35.814
you idiot! Come on!

13:35.898 --> 13:37.984
Bubbles:

13:35.898 --> 13:37.984
Ricky, stop slinging

13:35.898 --> 13:37.984
me with branches!

13:38.067 --> 13:39.860
(Panicked grunts)

13:39.944 --> 13:41.904
This is a great

13:39.944 --> 13:41.904
idea, Julian.

13:41.988 --> 13:43.822
Steal a fucking car

13:43.906 --> 13:46.409
and get in a foot chase

13:43.906 --> 13:46.409
with the police in

13:43.906 --> 13:46.409
1000 degree weather,

13:46.493 --> 13:48.411
things trying to fucking

13:46.493 --> 13:48.411
bite us in here probably.

13:48.495 --> 13:50.121
And this is my fault?

13:48.495 --> 13:50.121
I'm going the fuck home.

13:50.204 --> 13:51.830
(Gunshot)

13:50.204 --> 13:51.830
Bubbles:

13:50.204 --> 13:51.830
Oh my fuck,

13:51.914 --> 13:53.667
the cops are shooting at us!

13:51.914 --> 13:53.667
Yeah, maybe we'll

13:51.914 --> 13:53.667
shoot at them.

13:53.750 --> 13:55.335
Show them we're not

13:53.750 --> 13:55.335
fucking around here!

13:53.750 --> 13:55.335
(Click)

13:55.418 --> 13:57.337
Bubbles: Ricky!

13:55.418 --> 13:57.337
What you doing?

13:55.418 --> 13:57.337
Where'd you get that?

13:57.420 --> 13:59.798
It was in the fucking seat of

13:57.420 --> 13:59.798
the car. It must've belonged

13:57.420 --> 13:59.798
to Marty McSquito.

13:59.880 --> 14:03.343
Ricky, do not start

13:59.880 --> 14:03.343
firing at the US police.

13:59.880 --> 14:03.343
We're fucked here, boys.

14:03.426 --> 14:05.637
Come on, what are

14:03.426 --> 14:05.637
we going to do?

14:03.426 --> 14:05.637
Hang on, boys. Listen.

14:05.720 --> 14:08.389
The gun shots came from

14:05.720 --> 14:08.389
that way. There's no fucking

14:05.720 --> 14:08.389
way it was the cops.

14:08.473 --> 14:10.517
Unless they're fucking

14:08.473 --> 14:10.517
bionics or those

14:08.473 --> 14:10.517
Terminator types.

14:10.600 --> 14:12.686
They're not that.

14:10.600 --> 14:12.686
(Mixed shouting)

14:12.769 --> 14:14.937
Shh! I hear people.

14:15.021 --> 14:16.564
Come on.

14:16.648 --> 14:18.817
(Drums pounding,

14:16.648 --> 14:18.817
mixed shouting)

14:21.319 --> 14:22.737
What the fuck?

14:22.821 --> 14:24.739
Oh, my fucking God!

14:22.821 --> 14:24.739
What?

14:24.823 --> 14:27.575
Ricky:

14:24.823 --> 14:27.575
Boys, the car hit 88 miles

14:24.823 --> 14:27.575
an hour and cut out, okay.

14:27.659 --> 14:29.202
We went back in fucking time!

14:29.285 --> 14:30.870
Oh, come on, Ricky!

14:30.953 --> 14:33.289
Julian. We were in

14:30.953 --> 14:33.289
a fucking "DeLornean",

14:33.373 --> 14:35.333
hit 88 miles an hour,

14:33.373 --> 14:35.333
the fucking car cuts out,

14:35.416 --> 14:37.210
and I'm pretty sure

14:35.416 --> 14:37.210
I saw a big flash of light.

14:37.293 --> 14:39.253
We're back in time

14:37.293 --> 14:39.253
and we're fucked, boys.

14:39.337 --> 14:41.881
Ricky, you know

14:39.337 --> 14:41.881
Back to the Future was

14:39.337 --> 14:41.881
a fucking movie, right?

14:41.964 --> 14:44.425
Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

14:41.964 --> 14:44.425
The same fucking thing

14:41.964 --> 14:44.425
just happened to us.

14:44.509 --> 14:48.095
Bubbles: Ricky, that doesn't

14:44.509 --> 14:48.095
make sense. I wasn't

14:44.509 --> 14:48.095
even in the car!

14:48.179 --> 14:50.390
So, what do you want

14:48.179 --> 14:50.390
to do here, Bubs?

14:50.473 --> 14:53.017
I think it's one of those

14:50.473 --> 14:53.017
Civil War things, Julian.

14:53.100 --> 14:54.935
Maybe we could just,

14:53.100 --> 14:54.935
you know, blend in

14:55.019 --> 14:56.521
until the coast is clear.

14:56.604 --> 14:58.147
Blend in? What do you

14:56.604 --> 14:58.147
mean fucking blend in?

15:01.442 --> 15:03.027
Man, people were fucked

15:01.442 --> 15:03.027
in the head back then.

15:03.110 --> 15:05.029
Look how fucked we look.

15:05.112 --> 15:07.031
Ricky, we don't

15:05.112 --> 15:07.031
look fucked.

15:05.112 --> 15:07.031
We're blending in.

15:07.114 --> 15:08.616
This is how they used

15:07.114 --> 15:08.616
to dress back then.

15:08.700 --> 15:10.159
It doesn't mean

15:08.700 --> 15:10.159
they were fucked.

15:10.243 --> 15:11.619
Yeah, well now, when

15:10.243 --> 15:11.619
I'm back to the future,

15:11.703 --> 15:13.079
I'm going to show people

15:11.703 --> 15:13.079
how to fucking dress.

15:13.162 --> 15:14.664
Would you stop

15:13.162 --> 15:14.664
going on about that?

15:14.748 --> 15:16.583
We're not back

15:14.748 --> 15:16.583
in time, dummy.

15:16.666 --> 15:18.543
What are you privates

15:16.666 --> 15:18.543
doing back here in camp?

15:18.626 --> 15:20.961
Grab your rifles

15:18.626 --> 15:20.961
and get up there with

15:18.626 --> 15:20.961
the captain, now!

15:21.045 --> 15:22.756
Move, move!

15:21.045 --> 15:22.756
Bubbles:

15:21.045 --> 15:22.756
Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

15:22.839 --> 15:24.382
They're out there

15:22.839 --> 15:24.382
waiting for you. Go!

15:24.465 --> 15:25.884
Ricky:

15:24.465 --> 15:25.884
...now, Julian.

15:25.966 --> 15:27.761
Grab a rifle, boys.

15:27.844 --> 15:29.429
We're not really

15:27.844 --> 15:29.429
fucking going

15:27.844 --> 15:29.429
to battle, are we?

15:29.512 --> 15:31.347
Man:

15:29.512 --> 15:31.347
Quick, if you can

15:29.512 --> 15:31.347
move quick, do it!

15:31.431 --> 15:32.807
Ricky:

15:31.431 --> 15:32.807
This is fucked, Bubs.

15:36.644 --> 15:38.979
Attention.

15:39.063 --> 15:41.023
All right, gentleman,

15:39.063 --> 15:41.023
we're about to face

15:39.063 --> 15:41.023
the enemy.

15:41.107 --> 15:43.735
Some of you have never

15:41.107 --> 15:43.735
been in combat before.

15:43.818 --> 15:47.196
I want you to know

15:43.818 --> 15:47.196
you have one duty, and

15:43.818 --> 15:47.196
one duty alone out there

15:47.280 --> 15:49.449
and that is protect

15:47.280 --> 15:49.449
me at all costs.

15:49.532 --> 15:51.200
No sacrifice

15:49.532 --> 15:51.200
on your part

15:51.284 --> 15:53.202
is too great to

15:51.284 --> 15:53.202
achieve those ends.

15:53.286 --> 15:55.204
But if the worst

15:53.286 --> 15:55.204
should happen,

15:55.288 --> 15:57.916
I want you all to know

15:55.288 --> 15:57.916
that I will personally

15:55.288 --> 15:57.916
console the widows.

15:58.875 --> 16:00.794
Now attention.

15:58.875 --> 16:00.794
Shoulder arms.

16:01.586 --> 16:03.129
Forward, march!

16:03.212 --> 16:04.631
Okay, whoa, whoa,

16:03.212 --> 16:04.631
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

16:04.714 --> 16:06.507
Listen. If we listen

16:04.714 --> 16:06.507
to this guy,

16:06.591 --> 16:08.301
just so you know,

16:06.591 --> 16:08.301
you're all going

16:06.591 --> 16:08.301
to probably die.

16:08.384 --> 16:10.136
Those guys were saying

16:08.384 --> 16:10.136
it wasn't real.

16:10.219 --> 16:12.179
It sure seemed fucking real

16:10.219 --> 16:12.179
to me. I mean, it was real.

16:12.263 --> 16:14.933
I wasn't about to die

16:12.263 --> 16:14.933
in some goddamned

16:12.263 --> 16:14.933
civilian war. Fuck that!

16:15.015 --> 16:16.810
I'm from the future and

16:15.015 --> 16:16.810
this does not end well,

16:16.893 --> 16:18.561
from what

16:16.893 --> 16:18.561
I understand, so...

16:18.645 --> 16:20.814
Lucky for you, though,

16:18.645 --> 16:20.814
I'm not dumb, and I want

16:18.645 --> 16:20.814
to help you guys,

16:20.897 --> 16:22.941
so I got a weapon

16:20.897 --> 16:22.941
from the future.

16:20.897 --> 16:22.941
Ricky!

16:23.023 --> 16:24.734
I'm going to flank the enemy

16:23.023 --> 16:24.734
and I'm going to take out

16:24.818 --> 16:26.486
as many as I can

16:24.818 --> 16:26.486
with this thing.

16:24.818 --> 16:26.486
(Gunshot)

16:26.569 --> 16:28.488
Julian:

16:26.569 --> 16:28.488
Ricky! Put the gun away.

16:26.569 --> 16:28.488
Put it away!

16:28.571 --> 16:30.865
Calm down everybody.

16:28.571 --> 16:30.865
Look, my friend's

16:28.571 --> 16:30.865
not that bright.

16:30.949 --> 16:32.784
He thinks we went back

16:30.949 --> 16:32.784
in time in a DeLorean,

16:32.867 --> 16:34.494
but he's not going

16:32.867 --> 16:34.494
to hurt anybody.

16:34.577 --> 16:36.203
I'll get him back

16:34.577 --> 16:36.203
on his medication.

16:36.287 --> 16:38.372
What the fuck is the

16:36.287 --> 16:38.372
matter with you, man?

16:38.456 --> 16:40.249
I was just trying

16:38.456 --> 16:40.249
to help you guys

16:38.456 --> 16:40.249
so you don't die.

16:40.333 --> 16:42.126
Ricky, look. It's okay.

16:42.209 --> 16:45.045
We're on like a, like

16:42.209 --> 16:45.045
a challenge kind of TV...

16:45.129 --> 16:46.965
thing right now and

16:45.129 --> 16:46.965
we got lost in the woods.

16:47.047 --> 16:48.800
We were getting chased,

16:48.883 --> 16:50.593
and we're just trying to

16:48.883 --> 16:50.593
go 200 miles an hour today

16:50.677 --> 16:54.013
because if we can do that,

16:50.677 --> 16:54.013
we win a shitload of money.

16:54.096 --> 16:56.056
Well this is 2017.

16:56.140 --> 16:58.810
If you want a racetrack

16:56.140 --> 16:58.810
it's right down the road.

16:59.853 --> 17:02.897
A racetrack? Oh, fuck!

16:59.853 --> 17:02.897
There's a good idea.

17:02.981 --> 17:05.191
How the fuck was I supposed

17:02.981 --> 17:05.191
to know there's a racetrack

17:02.981 --> 17:05.191
down the road, huh?

17:05.274 --> 17:07.360
Well you're

17:05.274 --> 17:07.360
always going on,

17:05.274 --> 17:07.360
"Oh, I'm in charge!

17:07.443 --> 17:09.320
I'm in charge!

17:07.443 --> 17:09.320
I know everything!"

17:09.403 --> 17:11.656
All right. Sorry, guys.

17:09.403 --> 17:11.656
Continue on with

17:09.403 --> 17:11.656
whatever you're doing.

17:11.739 --> 17:13.741
We're sorry. We're

17:11.739 --> 17:13.741
out of here. All right.

17:11.739 --> 17:13.741
Let's go, boys.

17:13.825 --> 17:15.702
Sorry about that,

17:13.825 --> 17:15.702
everybody...

17:15.785 --> 17:18.287
Man: Reform. Quickly.

17:15.785 --> 17:18.287
They had racetracks

17:15.785 --> 17:18.287
back then?

17:18.371 --> 17:20.206
No, we're not

17:18.371 --> 17:20.206
back then, Ricky.

17:20.289 --> 17:22.375
We're in the normal time.

17:20.289 --> 17:22.375
We're in our time.

17:22.458 --> 17:24.961
We didn't go anywhere.

17:25.044 --> 17:27.087
Well, why are they going

17:25.044 --> 17:27.087
into battle? The wars are

17:25.044 --> 17:27.087
over, aren't they?

17:27.171 --> 17:29.340
Man:

17:27.171 --> 17:29.340
Guard against infantry. Guard!

17:29.423 --> 17:31.425
(Shouts)

17:29.423 --> 17:31.425
Man:

17:29.423 --> 17:31.425
Forward, march!

17:31.509 --> 17:34.136
(Mixed shouts)

17:31.509 --> 17:34.136
Forward!

17:34.220 --> 17:36.014
Boys, this is fucked!

17:36.096 --> 17:37.974
We can't afford this

17:36.096 --> 17:37.974
driving experience thing.

17:38.057 --> 17:41.019
Look, it's 480 bucks to go

17:38.057 --> 17:41.019
around the fucking track!

17:41.101 --> 17:43.730
Why didn't you just let me

17:41.101 --> 17:43.730
jump out of a fucking airplane

17:41.101 --> 17:43.730
and we'd be done already?

17:43.813 --> 17:45.773
Ricky, how are we

17:43.813 --> 17:45.773
going to get you

17:43.813 --> 17:45.773
on the radar gun

17:45.857 --> 17:47.817
when you're at fucking

17:45.857 --> 17:47.817
10,000 feet in the air, huh?

17:47.901 --> 17:49.736
I'll just wait until

17:47.901 --> 17:49.736
the last possible minute

17:47.901 --> 17:49.736
to pull the chute.

17:49.819 --> 17:52.279
Yeah, like I said,

17:49.819 --> 17:52.279
you'd die.

17:52.363 --> 17:54.448
Did you ever hear of

17:52.363 --> 17:54.448
parachutes, dummy? They

17:52.363 --> 17:54.448
keep you from getting dead.

17:54.532 --> 17:57.284
I know, Rick... Ah, fuck.

17:54.532 --> 17:57.284
We should just go home.

17:57.368 --> 17:58.912
You know what?

17:57.368 --> 17:58.912
I think you guys are right.

17:58.995 --> 18:00.747
This is fucking impossible.

18:00.830 --> 18:03.207
Bubs, I promised you

18:00.830 --> 18:03.207
we're making money today

18:03.290 --> 18:05.793
and we're making fucking

18:03.290 --> 18:05.793
money today come hell

18:03.290 --> 18:05.793
or high otters. Fuck this!

18:05.877 --> 18:08.004
How, Ricky?

18:05.877 --> 18:08.004
It depends.

18:08.087 --> 18:09.547
How stupid are you going

18:08.087 --> 18:09.547
to let me get here?

18:10.339 --> 18:11.424
What does that mean?

18:12.842 --> 18:14.719
All right, shit hair!

18:12.842 --> 18:14.719
Give me the fucking

18:12.842 --> 18:14.719
radar gun right now!

18:14.802 --> 18:16.303
Give it to me!

18:14.802 --> 18:16.303
What the fuck?

18:16.387 --> 18:17.972
Just relax. Nobody's

18:16.387 --> 18:17.972
going to get hurt.

18:18.056 --> 18:19.640
Ricky:

18:18.056 --> 18:19.640
This is not a big deal.

18:19.724 --> 18:21.308
It's not.

18:19.724 --> 18:21.308
It is, but it's not.

18:21.392 --> 18:23.895
Just relax. We just got

18:21.392 --> 18:23.895
one thing we've got to do.

18:25.271 --> 18:27.440
Everything's okay, sir.

18:27.523 --> 18:29.149
You're fucking crazy,

18:27.523 --> 18:29.149
man! I'm calling

18:27.523 --> 18:29.149
the fucking cops!

18:29.233 --> 18:30.777
Oh, would you

18:29.233 --> 18:30.777
fucking relax, buddy?

18:30.860 --> 18:33.112
...200 miles an hour,

18:30.860 --> 18:33.112
right the fuck now.

18:33.195 --> 18:35.531
Don't call the

18:33.195 --> 18:35.531
fucking cops!

18:35.615 --> 18:37.283
Nobody's going

18:35.615 --> 18:37.283
to get hurt.

18:37.366 --> 18:39.118
(Engine roaring)

18:39.201 --> 18:40.703
...it's only going to

18:39.201 --> 18:40.703
take a few minutes or...

18:40.787 --> 18:42.622
I know, but he's

18:40.787 --> 18:42.622
calling the cops now!

18:42.705 --> 18:44.624
We've got time.

18:42.705 --> 18:44.624
We don't, Julian!

18:44.707 --> 18:46.626
I can't go to jail

18:44.707 --> 18:46.626
in the United States!

18:44.707 --> 18:46.626
We're not...

18:46.709 --> 18:48.544
Bubs, we're not going

18:46.709 --> 18:48.544
to go to jail!

18:46.709 --> 18:48.544
Oh really?

18:48.628 --> 18:50.713
Holding a guy up

18:48.628 --> 18:50.713
at gun point.

18:50.797 --> 18:52.799
Is that thing on?

18:50.797 --> 18:52.799
You got it ready?

18:50.797 --> 18:52.799
Yes, it's fucking on.

18:52.882 --> 18:54.634
Well, fucking get it

18:52.882 --> 18:54.634
up then. He's coming.

18:54.717 --> 18:56.176
Bubbles:

18:54.717 --> 18:56.176
I know he is.

18:56.260 --> 18:58.596
Well, put your

18:56.260 --> 18:58.596
fucking arm up!

18:58.679 --> 19:00.681
I know how to work

18:58.679 --> 19:00.681
a fucking radar gun!

19:00.765 --> 19:03.142
Make sure you show it to

19:00.765 --> 19:03.142
the camera as soon as you

19:00.765 --> 19:03.142
get this fucking thing done.

19:03.225 --> 19:04.560
Bubbles:

19:03.225 --> 19:04.560
Okay. Here he comes.

19:04.644 --> 19:06.312
Come on. Come on.

19:04.644 --> 19:06.312
Come on, baby.

19:06.395 --> 19:07.897
Pedal to the

19:06.395 --> 19:07.897
fucking metal.

19:09.315 --> 19:11.567
180...

19:11.651 --> 19:12.986
204!

19:13.069 --> 19:14.862
Yes! 200... 204.

19:14.946 --> 19:16.405
Yeah!

19:14.946 --> 19:16.405
204!

19:16.489 --> 19:18.574
Look at that, Swearnet!

19:20.701 --> 19:22.244
Ricky:

19:20.701 --> 19:22.244
Well, thanks a lot.

19:22.328 --> 19:24.122
Ricky.

19:22.328 --> 19:24.122
No hard feelings.

19:24.204 --> 19:25.999
Sorry about that.

19:24.204 --> 19:25.999
Ricky, check it out.

19:26.082 --> 19:27.792
204.

19:26.082 --> 19:27.792
We've got to go.

19:27.875 --> 19:30.294
(Mixed shouting)

19:27.875 --> 19:30.294
...come on. Let's go!

19:30.377 --> 19:32.546
(Siren wailing)

19:30.377 --> 19:32.546
Dickweed called the cops.

19:30.377 --> 19:32.546
Get the fuck in the van!

19:32.630 --> 19:34.173
Ricky:

19:32.630 --> 19:34.173
Why are the cops coming?

19:36.801 --> 19:38.845
Would you relax?

19:36.801 --> 19:38.845
It's been 30 minutes.

19:38.928 --> 19:40.763
If the cops were going

19:38.928 --> 19:40.763
to bust us it already

19:38.928 --> 19:40.763
would have happened.

19:40.847 --> 19:42.765
You don't know that.

19:40.847 --> 19:42.765
Yes, I do.

19:42.849 --> 19:44.391
For fuck's sakes, boys.

19:42.849 --> 19:44.391
I don't understand.

19:44.475 --> 19:46.560
I don't think the fucking

19:44.475 --> 19:46.560
lighter fluid worked.

19:46.644 --> 19:48.688
Oh wow. Lighter fluid

19:46.644 --> 19:48.688
doesn't kill fucking crabs.

19:48.771 --> 19:50.481
Imagine that!

19:50.564 --> 19:52.650
Maybe it's time to

19:50.564 --> 19:52.650
sue the lighter fluid

19:50.564 --> 19:52.650
company, Ricky,

19:52.733 --> 19:54.652
for false advertising.

19:54.735 --> 19:56.320
That's a really good

19:54.735 --> 19:56.320
fucking idea, Bubs.

19:56.403 --> 19:57.697
If the old man was here,

19:56.403 --> 19:57.697
he probably would.

19:57.780 --> 19:59.532
Oh my fuck, Ricky.

19:59.615 --> 20:02.201
Did you ever think

19:59.615 --> 20:02.201
maybe the old man

19:59.615 --> 20:02.201
perpetually had crabs

20:02.284 --> 20:04.244
because the lighter fluid

20:02.284 --> 20:04.244
just doesn't work?

20:04.328 --> 20:06.288
He probably just

20:04.328 --> 20:06.288
got them once

20:06.372 --> 20:08.290
and just had them

20:06.372 --> 20:08.290
his whole life and

20:06.372 --> 20:08.290
didn't give a fuck.

20:08.374 --> 20:10.292
How the fuck would I know?

20:08.374 --> 20:10.292
I didn't sit around

20:10.376 --> 20:12.419
and stare at his fucking

20:10.376 --> 20:12.419
cock and balls all day

20:10.376 --> 20:12.419
and all night.

20:12.503 --> 20:13.921
You probably did though.

20:14.005 --> 20:16.174
I never stared

20:14.005 --> 20:16.174
at them once.

20:16.256 --> 20:18.509
Would you guys

20:16.256 --> 20:18.509
shut the fuck up?

20:18.592 --> 20:20.136
Hey, dickheads,

20:18.592 --> 20:20.136
Swearnet owes us some money.

20:20.219 --> 20:21.595
Let's go with

20:20.219 --> 20:21.595
some fucking cash!

20:21.679 --> 20:23.639
Camera man:

20:21.679 --> 20:23.639
We don't deal with money.

20:23.723 --> 20:26.392
We just shoot the footage

20:23.723 --> 20:26.392
and give it to them at

20:23.723 --> 20:26.392
the end of every night.

20:26.475 --> 20:28.728
Oh, for fuck's sakes!

20:26.475 --> 20:28.728
See, this is what I'm

20:26.475 --> 20:28.728
talking about, Bubs.

20:28.811 --> 20:31.105
Another Swearnet

20:28.811 --> 20:31.105
fucking technicality.

20:31.189 --> 20:33.315
Nice! We're not

20:31.189 --> 20:33.315
going to get...

20:31.189 --> 20:33.315
It's not my fault!

20:33.399 --> 20:35.609
We're not going to get

20:33.399 --> 20:35.609
fucking paid now!

20:33.399 --> 20:35.609
We'll get paid!

20:35.693 --> 20:37.778
You know what, boys?

20:35.693 --> 20:37.778
Me and my beautiful crabs,

20:37.862 --> 20:39.697
we're fucking done.

20:37.862 --> 20:39.697
I'm going home.

20:39.780 --> 20:41.949
No, you're not

20:39.780 --> 20:41.949
going home, Ricky.

20:42.033 --> 20:44.077
You're not going home.

20:42.033 --> 20:44.077
We're getting

20:42.033 --> 20:44.077
fucking paid.

20:44.160 --> 20:45.912
I'm going to get paid

20:45.995 --> 20:48.455
and make money to fucking

20:45.995 --> 20:48.455
record a song, eventually.

20:48.539 --> 20:50.791
And we're all

20:48.539 --> 20:50.791
in this together.

20:50.875 --> 20:53.419
We're all going,

20:50.875 --> 20:53.419
including your fucking crabs,

20:53.502 --> 20:55.713
on a fucking plane

20:53.502 --> 20:55.713
to N'awlins.

20:55.796 --> 20:58.382
What the fuck

20:55.796 --> 20:58.382
is "N'awlins"?

20:58.465 --> 21:01.427
That's the way cool people

20:58.465 --> 21:01.427
say "New Orleans".

21:03.429 --> 21:05.890
(Sighs)

21:03.429 --> 21:05.890
Don't be sighing.

21:05.973 --> 21:08.434
Would you just fuck off?

21:05.973 --> 21:08.434
I didn't really sigh.

21:08.517 --> 21:09.852
I did!

21:11.478 --> 21:13.313
Then take your sighs,

21:13.397 --> 21:15.108
and bake it in a pie.

21:16.609 --> 21:20.113
( ♪ )

22:46.991 --> 22:51.704
(Seabirds squawking)

23:01.047 --> 23:04.258
Fishes:

23:01.047 --> 23:04.258
Oh, fuck! Fuck!

23:01.047 --> 23:04.258
Fuck off! Fuck!...

23:04.342 --> 23:08.137
Fuck off! Jesus Christ!
