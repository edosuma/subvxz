00:13.471 --> 00:14.271
Come on!

00:15.070 --> 00:16.836
Ah! shouldn't have went in there, no way.

00:16.890 --> 00:18.575
I'm sorry, man. Don't tell Papa.

00:18.608 --> 00:19.842
Can we just put it back?

00:42.893 --> 00:44.226
Arlo, stay right there.

00:46.075 --> 00:47.175
Was that Pop?

00:48.242 --> 00:49.466
Hey, be cool.

00:55.214 --> 00:56.481
Are they coming for us?

00:56.775 --> 00:57.642
What?

00:58.062 --> 00:58.996
Did we do that?

00:59.235 --> 01:00.902
All right, you just stay here.

01:06.032 --> 01:07.408
There's way too many of them.

01:08.642 --> 01:10.442
- We should run.
- No.

01:10.608 --> 01:12.689
We improvise. We adapt. We overcome.

01:12.850 --> 01:14.384
Bea.

01:16.266 --> 01:17.866
Get upstairs with your brother.

01:38.015 --> 01:40.924
Yo, that's song of
freshness is on me, big dawg.

01:41.007 --> 01:43.883
You know, I'm still in the
streets, not industry yet, but...

01:43.919 --> 01:45.418
That's gonna change.

01:45.482 --> 01:46.515
Can't stop talent.

01:46.578 --> 01:49.150
Truth, man. Yeah.

01:49.383 --> 01:50.417
Yeah.

01:51.237 --> 01:52.221
Lose somebody?

01:53.883 --> 01:56.117
I'm just sayin', the place we goin',

01:56.150 --> 01:59.014
ain't exactly a spot for table dances, yo.

01:59.050 --> 02:03.819
Hey, they say some shit pops off
in that bitch. Like weird shit, bro.

02:03.906 --> 02:05.491
Don't believe everything you hear, Russ.

02:05.527 --> 02:07.953
Yeah, you know, I'm cool
with the Hastings, you know?

02:08.026 --> 02:08.994
Not everyone is.

02:09.750 --> 02:11.017
Hey, this is you.

02:21.168 --> 02:23.874
Hey, don't forget to phone me on
the 'Gram, you know what I'm saying?

03:08.073 --> 03:10.973
Death itself is not a tragedy.

03:11.908 --> 03:13.299
It's a natural occurrence.

03:13.363 --> 03:15.608
Not doing what you love with
your life, that's a tragedy,

03:15.642 --> 03:18.708
but your daddy, he passed
doing what he loved.

03:19.275 --> 03:22.542
He even wanted this. He was a great hunter.

03:24.142 --> 03:25.908
And that's a life to be celebrated.

03:40.166 --> 03:41.233
Oh, my baby.

03:42.328 --> 03:43.442
My baby.

03:43.542 --> 03:45.835
Oh, my God.

03:45.922 --> 03:47.189
Oh, my God.

03:47.508 --> 03:50.075
Oh, God. It's you.

03:53.142 --> 03:54.442
Please, forgive me.

03:55.046 --> 03:57.708
My Calvin's back from Afghanistan.

03:57.742 --> 03:59.175
Welcome home, son.

04:00.475 --> 04:01.508
Pop.

04:16.375 --> 04:17.642
All right.

04:26.572 --> 04:31.572
Subtitles by explosiveskull

04:31.608 --> 04:32.974
So, I'm remodeling the kitchen,

04:33.010 --> 04:36.643
and I'm finally gonna get
that oven I've always wanted.

04:37.176 --> 04:39.874
And we framed your brother's artwork
and put it around the house and...

04:39.944 --> 04:41.977
- It looks nice, right?
- Yeah, Mom.

04:42.108 --> 04:43.446
- It's nice.
- It's nice.

04:43.482 --> 04:44.460
Yeah.

04:44.496 --> 04:47.934
And I see you have the wind
chimes in the windows facing east.

04:47.970 --> 04:51.172
Yes, for Friday the
13th, wreath facing west.

04:51.208 --> 04:52.675
So everyone will be safe as usual.

04:52.708 --> 04:54.308
Oh, let me show you the renovated bathroom.

04:54.342 --> 04:56.442
Can we take a pause on this tour?

04:56.675 --> 04:59.242
I was just bringing him up to date, honey.

04:59.275 --> 05:00.475
I know that, sweetheart,

05:00.508 --> 05:02.808
but I think maybe we should
let Calvin bring us up to date.

05:04.008 --> 05:06.642
Then you can show him every
new toilet in the house.

05:16.642 --> 05:17.908
It's good to see you.

05:18.208 --> 05:20.075
But it's been 16 years.

05:20.342 --> 05:21.575
You retire?

05:21.662 --> 05:23.236
I'm on 30 days leave.

05:23.272 --> 05:24.442
Oh, that's wonderful.

05:24.570 --> 05:25.537
Why now?

05:25.720 --> 05:27.464
You fight long enough
and you start to realize

05:27.500 --> 05:29.720
it's less about the War
and more about your guys.

05:30.710 --> 05:34.242
You look up one day, see
time has passed you by.

05:35.375 --> 05:36.808
I needed to get back here.

05:37.508 --> 05:40.042
It would have been nice to
have heard from you, son.

05:40.075 --> 05:41.608
I wanna make things right.

05:42.344 --> 05:45.378
Help out with the business,
to fight here with Pop.

05:45.764 --> 05:48.062
You walked your ass
away from the fight here.

05:49.008 --> 05:52.608
But he's home now. Safe.

05:53.542 --> 05:56.808
And Lord knows, I couldn't
bear to lose another son.

06:00.742 --> 06:03.008
You know, why don't I make your favorite

06:03.208 --> 06:05.142
blackened catfish for dinner, hmm?

06:05.242 --> 06:06.608
That would be good, right?

06:07.175 --> 06:08.308
Yeah?

06:09.408 --> 06:10.417
Child.

06:10.453 --> 06:14.208
Hey, you are almost 20 minutes
late for your hospital pick up.

06:14.608 --> 06:16.342
The landscape has changed.

06:16.542 --> 06:19.367
Everything's elevated. You
can't just skip back in here.

06:19.417 --> 06:20.590
I'm a quick study.

06:20.626 --> 06:22.417
That may be, son, but combat fighting

06:22.450 --> 06:24.483
has nothing to do with
what we're doing here.

06:24.517 --> 06:26.517
Pop, with Friday the 13 coming up...

06:26.550 --> 06:29.883
Friday the 13th started
with an uninvited guest.

06:30.217 --> 06:32.750
Which, in this case, is you.

06:34.613 --> 06:36.839
Now Him sayeth in the Book,

06:36.910 --> 06:40.873
these signs shall follow them that believe.

06:40.909 --> 06:42.677
Amen! Amen!

06:42.713 --> 06:46.917
In my name, they shall cast out devils.

06:46.953 --> 06:49.181
Amen! Amen!

06:49.217 --> 06:52.183
They shall speak in new tongues.

06:52.217 --> 06:54.047
Amen! Amen!

06:54.083 --> 06:57.950
And they shall take up serpents.

06:57.983 --> 06:59.017
Yes.

07:11.650 --> 07:15.983
And if they drink any deadly thing,

07:16.129 --> 07:18.778
it shall not harm them.

07:18.862 --> 07:20.562
Amen!

07:20.683 --> 07:24.850
Our Lord and savior is right by our side,

07:26.083 --> 07:29.663
protecting us from all evils.

07:45.883 --> 07:48.517
Have faith! Have faith!

07:48.750 --> 07:51.716
Have faith! Have faith!

08:18.300 --> 08:22.467
I'm gonna need a little help gettin'
a party started for some of my friends.

08:52.842 --> 08:55.975
Patla, why aren't you collecting
the victims' personal effects?

08:56.008 --> 08:59.708
Forensics told me to wait, and
I hate snakes. I mean, for real.

08:59.742 --> 09:01.542
All right, snakes are gone. Come on.

09:01.575 --> 09:03.275
Okay, but still, how could snakes...

09:03.308 --> 09:05.775
We lost eight souls last night,
we got 15 more in the hospital.

09:05.808 --> 09:09.042
Whether it was an act of God or us
playing God, I need to know why. Right?

09:09.075 --> 09:10.975
- You're, what, five weeks with us now?
- Yes, ma'am.

09:11.008 --> 09:12.008
You gotta buckle up, son.

09:12.042 --> 09:14.318
La Rochelle crime ain't
nothing like Atlanta.

09:15.908 --> 09:17.842
It's a hell of a way to start the day.

09:17.875 --> 09:18.726
Yeah.

09:18.762 --> 09:20.608
Yeah, black coffee would
have been plenty, Urich.

09:20.642 --> 09:23.375
I talked to all the
survivors at the hospital,

09:23.408 --> 09:27.508
or at least I tried to, but all I got
was some evangelical jibber-jabber.

09:29.013 --> 09:31.479
That girl right there, she
ain't left since last night.

09:32.608 --> 09:33.875
I got this.

09:41.308 --> 09:42.642
Morning, Jessica.

09:45.042 --> 09:47.075
We've brought this upon
ourselves, Chief Westbrook.

09:47.108 --> 09:49.342
Oh, come on. I'm always just May to you.

09:50.275 --> 09:51.175
Brought what?

09:51.635 --> 09:54.108
"All of us have become
like one who is unclean,

09:54.142 --> 09:56.675
and all our righteous
acts are like filthy rags.

09:56.708 --> 09:58.875
We shrivel up like a
leaf, and like the wind..."

09:58.908 --> 10:00.408
"Our sins sweep us away."

10:00.442 --> 10:02.126
Isaiah 64 and 6.

10:02.586 --> 10:06.186
Redemption I get, but
using venomous snakes...

10:07.408 --> 10:08.775
Okay. All right.

10:09.178 --> 10:11.811
Okay. I'll have an officer drive you home.

10:13.508 --> 10:14.608
We'll be in touch.

10:27.194 --> 10:28.261
Hello.

10:28.475 --> 10:29.942
Oh, turn off that light.

10:30.042 --> 10:31.742
It's so dark in here.

10:32.808 --> 10:34.875
Oh, what is with the food orgy?

10:35.231 --> 10:36.563
I've been hungry all day.

10:36.838 --> 10:39.342
Yeah, well, last time you did
cross-fit training you ate like a horse.

10:39.375 --> 10:41.667
So... Aren't you hot?

10:42.442 --> 10:43.642
What, is the heat on?

10:45.642 --> 10:46.375
Don't.

10:46.649 --> 10:48.249
No, why are you acting so weird?

10:52.564 --> 10:54.525
I'm just so glad you're home, Nadine.

10:58.708 --> 11:01.242
- Over 100 snake bites.
- Oh, yeah.

11:01.342 --> 11:03.308
I've got a worn out thumb to prove it.

11:03.342 --> 11:05.142
How many snakes were found on the scene?

11:05.208 --> 11:06.975
- Guess.
- Tilly?

11:07.675 --> 11:09.058
Ah, you're no fun.

11:09.142 --> 11:10.702
Uh, not a one.

11:10.790 --> 11:14.025
According to May's report, there
were no snakes found on the premises,

11:14.058 --> 11:15.818
nor were any reported
seen by any neighbors.

11:15.885 --> 11:17.152
Take a look at this.

11:17.525 --> 11:20.389
There are bites on top of bites here.

11:20.538 --> 11:24.358
Venom varies from species to species.
You either have cytotoxic, neurotoxic...

11:24.453 --> 11:26.925
What type of venom was found on Nadine?

11:26.958 --> 11:28.325
All of the above.

11:28.358 --> 11:31.050
Which is impossible, because
there's some venom types from snakes

11:31.086 --> 11:32.825
not even found in this region.

11:36.045 --> 11:37.745
She's got a suspect.

11:38.225 --> 11:39.492
I'm gonna check it out.

11:54.758 --> 11:56.707
Check out Mr. Cool Breeze.

11:59.259 --> 12:00.971
You know, I was thinking to myself,

12:01.122 --> 12:02.222
Pop's gettin' old.

12:02.329 --> 12:03.963
Maybe it's better that I drive.

12:04.758 --> 12:06.225
Just trying to be of service.

12:06.425 --> 12:08.939
You took my classic lady without asking.

12:09.161 --> 12:11.661
- Eavesdropping.
- Such a nasty word.

12:11.758 --> 12:13.458
I prefer to call it intel gathering.

12:13.777 --> 12:15.044
Do we really have time for this?

12:15.197 --> 12:18.640
The only reason your ass is in this
car is because your mother begged me to.

12:18.719 --> 12:20.492
You wanna ride rusty in the field,

12:20.525 --> 12:22.385
your weapon goes in the trunk.

12:51.375 --> 12:54.333
You got an arsenal all laid out
back there like Sam and Dean?

12:54.367 --> 12:55.533
Oh, yeah.

12:59.767 --> 13:01.000
Move over.

13:08.567 --> 13:10.133
I know you ain't that crazy.

13:13.200 --> 13:15.353
Can't believe King Pins is gone.

13:15.409 --> 13:17.564
Hard to go bowling when you're hungry.

13:17.702 --> 13:19.102
Poor have gotten poorer.

13:19.750 --> 13:22.083
Silver spooners have gotten more silver.

13:22.716 --> 13:24.316
What's that they say in the village?

13:25.067 --> 13:27.000
"Greed lessens what is gathered."

13:28.267 --> 13:31.033
Yeah, well, I'd barely
recognize some of this town.

13:31.952 --> 13:33.374
A lot has changed.

13:33.911 --> 13:36.983
Like letting our funeral parlor
be an annex to the city morgue?

13:37.100 --> 13:39.733
Yeah. Helps with the bottom line.

13:40.133 --> 13:42.167
Plus, we got a few side hustles going on.

13:43.467 --> 13:45.267
At least we have a new
and improved relationship

13:45.300 --> 13:47.696
with our local PD on the special cases.

13:47.779 --> 13:50.854
But I wouldn't exactly
say it's business as usual.

13:51.114 --> 13:52.414
What do you mean by that?

14:00.133 --> 14:02.168
Clean up the paperwork and
then I'll sign off on it.

14:02.204 --> 14:04.671
Not a second before. Okay?

14:06.552 --> 14:07.586
May.

14:08.200 --> 14:09.700
I got here as soon as I could.

14:12.889 --> 14:13.823
May.

14:14.919 --> 14:15.819
Calvin.

14:16.651 --> 14:17.985
Man, May, look at you.

14:19.838 --> 14:21.271
When did you get back?

14:22.000 --> 14:23.067
Yesterday.

14:23.100 --> 14:24.200
You the law now?

14:24.609 --> 14:26.301
You used to hate authority back in the day.

14:26.357 --> 14:27.816
Yeah, well, a lot has changed.

14:28.999 --> 14:29.833
Clearly.

14:33.743 --> 14:35.059
So, you work with your father now?

14:35.133 --> 14:36.067
- No.
- Yes.

14:38.151 --> 14:40.251
Tilly's prelim on the body you sent her.

14:40.350 --> 14:42.050
Looks like a lot more than a snake bite.

14:42.250 --> 14:43.706
Now, you said you had a suspect?

14:43.777 --> 14:46.615
Yes. So far I've been able
to hold back the press.

14:46.670 --> 14:49.192
You have clearance for the
holding cells, but Calvin...

14:49.228 --> 14:52.017
Calvin will just have to wait his ass here.

15:02.268 --> 15:04.968
Killing the lights was the only
way to keep her from screaming.

15:07.916 --> 15:10.283
Guard, let's get a medic in here.

15:11.867 --> 15:12.867
Is that...

15:13.161 --> 15:14.461
It's her skin.

15:15.845 --> 15:17.312
Can I see her personals?

15:18.272 --> 15:19.505
This is ancient.

15:19.944 --> 15:21.677
Second century AD.

15:22.555 --> 15:23.955
How does he know that?

15:24.329 --> 15:26.262
Probably because his old ass was there.

15:28.218 --> 15:29.952
If it's that old, how'd she get it?

15:35.450 --> 15:36.217
Yeah?

15:36.452 --> 15:38.864
The coin honors Glycon, the snake god.

15:38.900 --> 15:40.367
- Macedonia.
- Right.

15:40.400 --> 15:43.100
See, back then, snake
cults were all the rage.

15:43.133 --> 15:46.167
Then came virgin sacrifices, cannibalism,

15:46.200 --> 15:47.322
baby eating.

15:47.358 --> 15:50.133
They worshipped innocence, so
the purity of a baby would be...

15:50.167 --> 15:51.864
Like having filet mignon.

15:51.971 --> 15:52.897
Exactly.

15:52.933 --> 15:55.467
See, legend has it that...

15:55.500 --> 15:59.500
Yeah, the curse drove people to
take on various snake-like qualities.

15:59.533 --> 16:02.321
What if Jessica took on
snake-like qualities and it was...

16:02.665 --> 16:03.931
...lunchtime?

16:05.833 --> 16:07.700
Did Calvin or you touch the coin?

16:09.633 --> 16:10.567
Are you kidding?

16:11.091 --> 16:13.467
- Should have been the first damn question.
- Calvin.

16:13.500 --> 16:15.767
- Neither of us have. May?
- No.

16:16.133 --> 16:17.813
We're good here, Tilly, thanks.

16:21.372 --> 16:24.326
Hey, hold up, hold up, this coin
didn't just jump into this bag.

16:24.374 --> 16:27.167
Officer Wright booked Jessica
and handled her personals, but...

16:27.933 --> 16:30.733
He's not here. He's been
doing half days, because he...

16:34.167 --> 16:35.933
Because he's got a newborn at home.

16:40.467 --> 16:44.267
For now, outside of me, you
and Calvin have no friends here.

16:44.772 --> 16:46.614
All right? I'm sorry to remind
you, but you are not cops.

16:46.650 --> 16:48.229
Ma'am, can I show you this?

16:48.967 --> 16:52.300
May, do you really wanna take that risk?

16:53.400 --> 16:55.896
I'll forward you Byron
Wright's address. Go.

16:55.992 --> 16:58.533
You know, Officer Wright might not have
been the only one to handle that coin.

16:58.567 --> 17:01.967
I know. I'll have Urich set up a screening
for any other officers who may have.

17:04.367 --> 17:06.700
Hey, you and I need to talk.

17:07.700 --> 17:08.666
Later.

17:12.722 --> 17:14.488
Just leave us alone, Byron!

17:18.012 --> 17:19.079
You still my boo?

17:21.398 --> 17:23.060
No! No!

17:27.185 --> 17:28.319
Byron, no!

17:29.733 --> 17:31.100
No, stop!

17:32.833 --> 17:33.867
Help me!

17:34.067 --> 17:35.500
Help my baby!

17:46.085 --> 17:47.085
Stay in the car.

17:52.263 --> 17:53.430
Officer Wright?

17:55.496 --> 17:56.363
Officer Wright?

18:07.700 --> 18:08.633
Stop!

18:08.733 --> 18:09.667
Hey!

18:18.944 --> 18:20.044
Stay down!

18:22.567 --> 18:23.567
Calvin, get out.

18:34.545 --> 18:36.620
Calvin! Take the baby!

18:41.033 --> 18:42.367
Come on, come on.

18:45.119 --> 18:46.787
- Here, May. Take the baby.
- Yeah, yeah.

19:00.276 --> 19:01.376
That's enough!

19:03.426 --> 19:04.826
Calvin! No!

19:04.933 --> 19:05.900
Let him live!

19:10.219 --> 19:11.052
He'll live.

19:15.169 --> 19:17.435
Guys, you gotta get out
of here, you gotta go.

19:18.233 --> 19:19.100
Baby.

19:19.133 --> 19:21.233
- Where is my baby?
- Your baby is fine.

19:21.267 --> 19:23.033
You did good, Warrior Mom. You did good.

19:23.830 --> 19:26.212
Your weapon was under combination lock.

19:26.297 --> 19:28.830
You used Arlo's birthday,
instead of your firstborn.

19:29.667 --> 19:31.267
Maybe I loved him more.

19:34.800 --> 19:36.933
- I had my eyes closed, baby.
- Mmm-hmm.

19:36.967 --> 19:39.468
I saw the venom go in his eyes.

19:39.555 --> 19:40.814
It was probably just spit.

19:40.850 --> 19:42.108
Spit?

19:42.208 --> 19:43.975
Your boy had a forked tongue.

19:44.375 --> 19:46.242
Let me just take you to the
doctor so we can be sure.

19:46.275 --> 19:47.308
He's fine.

19:47.775 --> 19:50.108
Get your boots off of the table.

19:51.612 --> 19:53.779
Like we need more bad mojo around here?

19:54.308 --> 19:56.542
- You're good?
- I'm good.

19:57.363 --> 19:59.863
Now, a coin that powerful,
that doesn't just get out there.

20:00.075 --> 20:02.675
Someone or something put it out there.

20:02.908 --> 20:05.342
- You think it's still on the move?
- Oh, definitely.

20:06.775 --> 20:10.975
Yo, I got the bag from the
hospital, and I got some supplies.

20:12.042 --> 20:14.308
Yo, that was my old job.

20:14.975 --> 20:17.408
- I'm Calvin.
- Yeah, the great Calvin Hastings.

20:17.508 --> 20:18.642
I know.

20:18.875 --> 20:20.008
I got this.

20:21.408 --> 20:22.275
Calvin.

20:23.075 --> 20:25.108
You wanna talk seriously
about getting ready?

20:25.142 --> 20:27.175
But you ain't got to get
ready if you're born ready.

20:27.742 --> 20:29.308
- See me out there?
- Yeah.

20:29.742 --> 20:31.797
I told you to stay in the
car, you didn't listen.

20:32.042 --> 20:33.375
Come upstairs.

20:35.775 --> 20:37.208
- Upstairs.
- Mmm.

20:43.875 --> 20:45.108
Look around you.

20:47.075 --> 20:49.275
Now, you can't just come
up and clown talk your way

20:49.308 --> 20:51.242
through 16 years of rough stuff.

20:51.575 --> 20:54.708
Almost every one of
our weapons has evolved.

20:55.442 --> 20:57.542
Bullets rarely stop an infernal.

20:57.842 --> 21:00.608
Now, runes are mystical
patterns that harness energy.

21:00.642 --> 21:05.040
This rune can give your bullet the
ability to stop an infernal or a ghost.

21:05.076 --> 21:07.442
But only if it's engraved perfectly.

21:07.642 --> 21:08.942
You try.

21:10.308 --> 21:11.575
Go ahead, get in there.

21:18.142 --> 21:19.308
Mmm-hmm.

21:20.408 --> 21:21.242
No.

21:21.642 --> 21:23.208
No. Son, look.

21:23.675 --> 21:25.108
You messed up the rune.

21:25.542 --> 21:26.983
Did I ruin the rune?

21:27.019 --> 21:28.047
It's funny.

21:28.222 --> 21:30.908
One faulty line and there's no enhancement.

21:33.292 --> 21:34.925
You got a lot to learn, Calvin.

21:36.025 --> 21:37.692
Having a control freak.

21:38.125 --> 21:42.225
Calvin. Why are you really back here?

21:45.692 --> 21:47.592
You think I really
wanted to come back here?

21:48.862 --> 21:52.200
This museum of death
where I had no childhood.

21:52.458 --> 21:55.358
All we did was train
and chase poltergeists.

21:55.392 --> 21:56.825
You know what the kids used to call me?

21:58.825 --> 22:01.792
Creepy Calvin. Yeah.

22:03.125 --> 22:06.258
Now if you're done feeling sorry for
yourself, why don't you let me know?

22:06.292 --> 22:08.792
Because there is a lot of work to do here.

22:08.992 --> 22:10.358
Things have changed, Pop.

22:11.992 --> 22:13.340
A lot has changed.

22:14.192 --> 22:16.525
Since you were a kid, we
human beings have destroyed

22:16.558 --> 22:18.747
over half of the world's wildlife.

22:18.866 --> 22:20.825
Instead of being good
stewards of this Earth,

22:20.858 --> 22:22.458
we are sucking it dry.

22:23.858 --> 22:24.925
I know this.

22:25.525 --> 22:26.774
What's your point?

22:27.092 --> 22:29.925
This imbalance is causing a rise in evil

22:30.592 --> 22:33.025
among us and outside.

22:33.692 --> 22:36.910
It's as if the infernals
have come to put us in check.

22:37.692 --> 22:40.325
You know, Pop, after
what I saw in Afghanistan,

22:41.092 --> 22:43.125
I really wonder if we're even worth saving.

22:43.225 --> 22:45.958
Well, I think if the
Wrights' baby could talk,

22:46.392 --> 22:47.825
it'd probably say yes.

22:50.092 --> 22:55.558
Regardless, as the protectors of
La Rochelle for over 100 years,

22:55.925 --> 22:57.392
this is what we do.

22:57.892 --> 22:59.488
We keep the balance.

22:59.653 --> 23:01.320
We kill the infernals.

23:01.458 --> 23:03.125
Now there's no 401(k),

23:03.358 --> 23:04.757
there's no followers,

23:04.853 --> 23:06.058
there's no health plan.

23:06.292 --> 23:07.629
There is no fame.

23:07.862 --> 23:09.725
So you really wanna roll with me?

23:10.201 --> 23:12.792
When I say jump, you
get out the trampoline.

23:13.892 --> 23:16.325
And now you carve up them damn bullets,

23:16.425 --> 23:19.777
and you don't stop until they're perfect.

23:23.972 --> 23:27.662
I find it interesting to put things
in motion to see what happens.

23:27.792 --> 23:30.725
Me and you, we similar in that way.

23:30.992 --> 23:33.692
Oh, well, shit, I'm just
doing what I know how to do...

23:33.725 --> 23:35.892
Gods work. Yes, indeed.

23:36.425 --> 23:39.378
You know, when you stick your hands deep
in Mother Earth and you plant a seed,

23:39.452 --> 23:41.115
you're putting things in motion.

23:41.298 --> 23:43.565
Then, harvest time.

23:45.058 --> 23:47.725
There's no pride in hauling
a half-empty truck to town.

23:50.225 --> 23:51.558
Yield was crap.

23:55.425 --> 23:57.259
For your father's Alzheimer's.

24:01.258 --> 24:02.358
How did you know?

24:03.158 --> 24:04.725
Fears reveal all.

24:08.125 --> 24:11.158
You know, I got a feeling more
change is coming in the air for you.

24:12.992 --> 24:14.850
From your lips to God's ears.

24:15.792 --> 24:19.025
Aw, he ain't never cared
what I've had to say.

24:19.956 --> 24:21.256
No I-Him.

24:30.685 --> 24:32.519
So you lived here 16 years ago?

24:35.045 --> 24:36.812
So you're talking to me now?

24:43.025 --> 24:44.992
You know my name, do I get yours?

24:46.392 --> 24:47.625
Garvey.

24:48.492 --> 24:49.592
Garvey.

24:50.850 --> 24:51.550
You live here?

24:53.639 --> 24:55.906
No. Just work here part time.

24:58.233 --> 24:59.567
Heard you're in the military.

25:00.333 --> 25:01.600
You ever kill anyone?

25:03.785 --> 25:05.119
Here's a piece of advice.

25:06.367 --> 25:08.138
Never ask a vet that question.

25:10.333 --> 25:11.600
Sorry.

25:13.100 --> 25:15.267
Too many war movies, I guess.

25:16.333 --> 25:18.533
They make platoons look like families.

25:19.500 --> 25:20.967
Well, they are.

25:22.171 --> 25:23.971
And just as dysfunctional.

25:26.000 --> 25:27.633
Did you ever leave any family?

25:29.300 --> 25:30.733
I mean, in the fields.

25:34.100 --> 25:35.400
Where's this coming from?

25:36.200 --> 25:37.367
I don't know.

25:38.233 --> 25:40.100
I just think about that sometimes.

25:41.100 --> 25:42.667
Don't think I could do it.

25:44.133 --> 25:48.067
Well, when I signed up,

25:49.267 --> 25:50.567
I was just a kid.

25:51.133 --> 25:52.400
Had a lot to learn.

25:54.033 --> 25:56.733
But if it's not about putting
the platoon in jeopardy,

25:58.300 --> 26:00.067
leaving a Marine behind

26:00.100 --> 26:02.133
is about the most weak-ass
thing you could do.

26:08.533 --> 26:10.700
Then welcome to your most weak-ass thing.

26:12.867 --> 26:15.192
Because I'm the daughter you left behind.

26:32.195 --> 26:33.128
Hey.

26:34.200 --> 26:36.478
I'm on my break. How did
you even know I was...

26:36.603 --> 26:39.097
I told Detective Urich it
was official police business.

26:39.207 --> 26:41.917
Hey, you okay? Don't you touch me, nigga.

26:41.981 --> 26:45.233
You and your family gonna rot in
hell for what you've done here.

26:45.467 --> 26:46.733
That happens a lot.

26:48.800 --> 26:49.933
I gotta ask.

26:50.062 --> 26:52.828
Would it have killed you to
let me know I had a daughter?

26:55.233 --> 26:57.167
Okay. Would it have
killed you to let me know

26:57.203 --> 26:59.333
you were breaking up with
me and off to Afghanistan?

26:59.367 --> 27:02.433
Yeah. 'Cause you were the only
one who could have stopped me.

27:02.867 --> 27:05.333
Look after what happened
to Arlo, I was selfish.

27:05.367 --> 27:07.618
But for you keep me out of
Garvey's life for revenge is...

27:07.654 --> 27:10.633
It's not all about you, soldier
boy. I did that to protect Garvey.

27:10.667 --> 27:13.388
What do I look like, using my
child to tether a man to my life

27:13.424 --> 27:14.674
who didn't really want to be in it?

27:14.710 --> 27:15.855
What I did to you haunts me.

27:15.891 --> 27:18.491
And I will not let you do that to Garvey.

27:20.700 --> 27:23.233
I tried to tell you about
it at the police station.

27:23.267 --> 27:25.100
I never would have left my daughter.

27:25.700 --> 27:26.500
My daughter.

27:26.533 --> 27:28.300
My daughter who now hates me.

27:29.933 --> 27:32.000
Your daughter who is you.

27:36.788 --> 27:38.955
- Really?
- Oh, yeah.

27:40.987 --> 27:42.853
I guess I owe you another apology, then.

27:48.133 --> 27:49.221
Westbrook. Go.

27:49.257 --> 27:51.820
We have a surge in domestic
disturbances and riot calls

27:51.856 --> 27:53.162
involving gold coins.

27:53.200 --> 27:55.769
We're running low on cell
space and officers to dispatch.

27:55.805 --> 27:58.642
Review with the officers how to handle
any gold coins found. I'm on the way.

27:58.697 --> 27:59.816
Tilly should have some
force on the coins, too.

27:59.852 --> 28:00.753
Okay.

28:00.789 --> 28:02.555
Hey, we'll finish this.

28:02.830 --> 28:03.963
Yeah.

28:08.667 --> 28:10.233
Well, May has each one of her deputies

28:10.267 --> 28:12.067
wearing gloves when handling the coins,

28:12.100 --> 28:14.033
but we still don't know
how many are out there.

28:14.067 --> 28:16.733
Mmm. The story behind the coin is spotty.

28:16.767 --> 28:18.733
See, 13 were made by the snake cult,

28:18.767 --> 28:21.133
and Judas was the 13th guest.

28:21.167 --> 28:22.899
Well, 13's a bad omen.

28:22.967 --> 28:27.248
And today is Friday the 13th.

28:27.467 --> 28:29.333
Were they made as punishment?

28:29.807 --> 28:30.674
I don't know.

28:31.533 --> 28:34.267
But to locate, transport, and
get these out there, I mean,

28:34.303 --> 28:37.333
this is the work of an infernal
more powerful than we've ever seen.

28:37.367 --> 28:40.400
There's a legend of an infernal that
caused mayhem in the Middle East,

28:40.480 --> 28:43.080
in order to drive out
the strongest for battle.

28:43.418 --> 28:44.985
Is this here that we...

28:45.185 --> 28:47.407
We have to get all 13
coins to break the curse.

28:47.542 --> 28:49.400
So we have to get those
coins off the streets,

28:49.433 --> 28:51.213
or a lot of people will die.

28:51.292 --> 28:52.959
And out of 13, we have what?

28:53.233 --> 28:54.000
One?

28:54.867 --> 28:56.933
Well, sometimes one is all you need.

28:58.800 --> 29:00.933
So, Tilly and I spoke about this.

29:01.900 --> 29:04.000
There's a Nubian mystical practice

29:04.033 --> 29:07.167
that will allow me to locate
all the remaining coins.

29:07.633 --> 29:09.700
But I have to hold one to do it.

29:10.233 --> 29:11.267
No.

29:11.833 --> 29:13.400
That's not a good option.

29:48.834 --> 29:51.101
I swear I just found
out about you right now.

29:51.267 --> 29:53.033
I did not abandon you.

29:54.300 --> 29:55.533
Wow.

29:56.737 --> 29:59.105
You know, I feel so much better

29:59.233 --> 30:01.248
knowing you only abandoned my mother.

30:05.433 --> 30:06.967
May shut me out,

30:07.000 --> 30:08.767
but I gave her good reason to.

30:10.300 --> 30:12.333
I'm sorry I missed so much of your life.

30:13.661 --> 30:14.661
I'm not.

30:15.267 --> 30:17.667
It got me ready to grow
up in this shitty world.

30:19.767 --> 30:23.095
Look, I know how important
it is to have a father.

30:23.667 --> 30:26.523
Love, and advice, and support.

30:26.610 --> 30:28.878
- And all the...
- Wow.

30:28.998 --> 30:31.183
You know, I'm glad you're
all woke on fatherhood,

30:31.277 --> 30:32.501
but really, I'm good.

30:38.158 --> 30:40.651
Look, we do not have a past because of me.

30:40.767 --> 30:43.067
But maybe we can find a way to get closer.

30:48.952 --> 30:50.952
Who's holding up the damn elevator?

30:54.200 --> 30:56.767
It's not like I'm gonna ask you
to call me Pop, but I think...

30:56.867 --> 30:58.801
Yeah. Wise choice, Calvin.

31:03.030 --> 31:04.130
I got this.

31:23.533 --> 31:24.800
Congratulations.

31:26.254 --> 31:27.687
Welcome to fatherhood.

31:37.454 --> 31:39.254
It pained us not to tell you, son.

31:40.167 --> 31:41.400
But we, uh...

31:43.067 --> 31:44.667
We had to follow May's wishes,

31:44.700 --> 31:46.567
and then when you didn't
call your mother back...

31:46.600 --> 31:47.833
I deserved it.

31:49.338 --> 31:51.603
No, it's not about deserve.

31:51.933 --> 31:55.933
"Deserve" implies there's some bigger,
preordained order to this existence.

31:56.400 --> 31:58.367
We human beings have free will.

31:59.567 --> 32:01.767
It's about the impact you make now,

32:02.433 --> 32:04.133
it's about your legacy.

32:06.747 --> 32:08.751
Sure made a legacy with Garvey, didn't I?

32:10.258 --> 32:12.524
Well, you made an impact when
you put her on this planet.

32:16.600 --> 32:17.900
But legacy,

32:18.933 --> 32:20.732
the legacy is still forming.

32:21.733 --> 32:23.200
And now you have her.

32:26.033 --> 32:27.400
I don't have her, Pop.

32:28.967 --> 32:30.033
How can I?

32:30.737 --> 32:33.024
- I, I, I just met...
- Hey, hey.

32:34.167 --> 32:35.667
Do I not have you?

32:38.433 --> 32:39.567
Huh?

32:42.133 --> 32:43.367
We're ready.

32:55.484 --> 32:56.984
I see a cabin.

32:59.442 --> 33:01.060
A man in black.

33:02.354 --> 33:04.021
He has the coins.

33:05.275 --> 33:07.608
It's cold.

33:08.175 --> 33:09.675
Oh, it's so cold!

33:11.808 --> 33:13.708
Tilly. Tilly, pull her out.

33:13.742 --> 33:15.442
- No, she's almost there...
- Pull her out!

33:15.808 --> 33:17.613
Tilly!

33:17.692 --> 33:19.820
No, no, no! No!

33:19.856 --> 33:22.908
You have to talk her down.

33:23.275 --> 33:24.977
Ça suffit, chère. It's over.

33:25.013 --> 33:28.083
- I was so cold...
- It's over. It's over.

33:28.144 --> 33:30.377
Tilly, what's happening?

33:30.450 --> 33:33.184
The infernal somehow enhanced
the curse on the coin.

33:33.249 --> 33:35.149
He broke our protection.

33:45.884 --> 33:46.994
I'm sorry.

33:47.197 --> 33:48.063
Don't be.

33:49.208 --> 33:50.575
You did your job.

33:51.551 --> 33:53.984
Now I'm gonna go do
mine, and figure this out.

34:18.074 --> 34:20.608
The path of the violence seems to
be heading straight for city hall.

34:21.507 --> 34:23.321
- It's a mess out there, chief.
- Okay, all right.

34:23.357 --> 34:24.413
Just calm down, okay?

34:25.672 --> 34:28.032
- A pattern is building.
- Yeah, but to what?

34:28.275 --> 34:31.331
May, you sent me an image map
tracking all the violent outbreaks.

34:31.416 --> 34:34.061
Now, another way to look at
that pattern leads to here.

34:34.675 --> 34:36.408
Elysium Park Cemetery.

34:37.175 --> 34:38.824
Consecrated grounds.

34:38.911 --> 34:42.244
Where else would an infernal with
a snake jones on Friday the 13th go?

34:42.592 --> 34:44.159
At least it's not our cemetery.

34:44.442 --> 34:46.275
If my deputies and I
secure any more gold coins,

34:46.308 --> 34:48.085
I'll make sure to get them
to Tilly and head your way.

34:48.121 --> 34:50.811
Negative. No one goes in
or out of that cemetery

34:50.847 --> 34:52.447
other than me and my son.

34:52.708 --> 34:54.675
Copy that.

35:02.542 --> 35:03.540
Hey!

35:03.649 --> 35:05.622
We can't just do nothing,
that truck's about to blow!

35:05.658 --> 35:07.271
- We need a medic...
- I'm on it, I'm on it!

35:12.519 --> 35:14.285
Hey, hey!

35:19.842 --> 35:21.375
Move out the way, out the way, out the way!

35:25.108 --> 35:27.299
Let's go, let's go, let's go. Come on.

35:28.242 --> 35:30.821
Stay with me, stay with me. All right.

35:33.405 --> 35:35.939
I can't come into this room
without thinking about Arlo.

35:36.117 --> 35:37.881
Arlo would have been a hell of a warrior.

35:38.497 --> 35:40.147
The instincts he had naturally?

35:41.062 --> 35:42.629
Took me years to cultivate.

35:44.955 --> 35:46.430
Your mother's a strong woman.

35:47.653 --> 35:50.105
- Should've seen this coming.
- Why?

35:50.222 --> 35:51.990
'Cause you think you
saw your brother's death?

35:52.108 --> 35:53.242
That's not on you.

35:53.275 --> 35:55.158
I saw Arlo's death, Pop.

35:55.194 --> 35:56.408
We could have stopped it.

35:56.513 --> 35:58.034
That is on you.

35:59.185 --> 36:00.185
Yes, it is.

36:01.070 --> 36:02.342
That's why you came back here?

36:02.985 --> 36:05.219
You want to make sure I didn't forget?

36:05.375 --> 36:06.869
I came back to save you.

36:08.204 --> 36:09.204
Me?

36:11.517 --> 36:12.717
You've had more visions?

36:13.717 --> 36:14.717
How many?

36:17.978 --> 36:20.478
- First one in 16 years.
- Trust me, son.

36:21.050 --> 36:22.217
I'ma be just fine.

36:22.496 --> 36:23.796
Like Arlo?

36:24.117 --> 36:27.083
I saw you die, Pop. I'll be
damned if I let it happen again.

36:27.647 --> 36:28.914
I need to do this alone.

36:29.339 --> 36:30.669
We don't have a lot of time.

36:31.283 --> 36:33.483
We gotta get those coins
and save your mother.

36:43.658 --> 36:45.225
This feels like a trap.

36:45.258 --> 36:46.988
Oh yeah, that's 'cause it is.

36:47.457 --> 36:48.490
We're not ready for this.

36:49.838 --> 36:52.205
I thought you was born ready, Shaka Zulu.

36:53.325 --> 36:55.589
We improvise, we adapt, we overcome.

36:56.858 --> 36:58.547
- I go in first.
- Negative.

36:58.584 --> 37:00.892
You go in there with even the
thought of trying to protect me,

37:00.972 --> 37:02.005
and you are dead.

37:03.950 --> 37:06.383
- I can't let you...
- You can, and you will.

37:07.055 --> 37:09.047
He who conquers himself

37:09.342 --> 37:11.818
is the mightiest warrior.

37:12.425 --> 37:14.378
You'll just kill him with all your quotes.

37:17.825 --> 37:19.158
Just for the record...

37:19.986 --> 37:21.913
There's no one I'd rather go in there with.

37:46.225 --> 37:48.758
The electromagnetic
disturbance is off the scale.

37:50.135 --> 37:53.035
- It's strongest right up there.
- Let's split up.

37:54.083 --> 37:55.950
You go right. I go straight.

37:56.528 --> 37:59.071
This is infernal fall.
Don't get lost in it.

38:32.588 --> 38:34.188
Calvin?

38:35.350 --> 38:37.916
Arlo, that... Can't be you.

38:38.617 --> 38:40.250
Why'd you let me die, man?

38:40.283 --> 38:41.850
I tried to save you.

38:42.417 --> 38:43.850
I tried, brother.

38:44.117 --> 38:45.617
You still can.

38:46.097 --> 38:47.729
I mean, I'm in limbo.

38:48.573 --> 38:49.886
And you can get me out.

38:52.873 --> 38:54.563
Oh. It can't be you.

38:55.217 --> 38:56.583
Your Glock right there?

38:58.683 --> 39:00.050
Put one right here.

39:01.450 --> 39:03.926
The runes in your bullets
will set my soul free.

39:07.883 --> 39:09.150
I, I...

39:09.883 --> 39:11.850
I can't do that.

39:11.883 --> 39:15.301
- Calvin.
- Don't, don't leave me behind again.

39:15.650 --> 39:16.817
Not here.

39:17.843 --> 39:20.840
Either you set me free,
or you'll join me here.

39:23.769 --> 39:25.120
My son wouldn't do that.

39:25.519 --> 39:27.556
I'm sorry, man. This is how Limbo works.

39:28.283 --> 39:29.883
And it's so lonely.

39:30.203 --> 39:31.703
All those people you killed in Afghanistan,

39:31.817 --> 39:33.680
and you can't even look
out for your own brother?

39:35.350 --> 39:36.950
Calvin, please.

39:38.050 --> 39:39.550
Set me free.

39:45.017 --> 39:46.567
You better make some space in limbo,

39:46.651 --> 39:48.255
it's about to get crowded in that bitch.

39:50.834 --> 39:52.867
- Calvin?
- Calvin!

39:54.783 --> 39:56.450
Pop! Arlo...

39:56.483 --> 39:58.517
No, no son, it was an illusion.

39:58.550 --> 39:59.750
You're okay.

40:02.783 --> 40:07.627
Bravo! Bravo, that was amazing theater.

40:07.783 --> 40:11.185
It was well worth the price
of my additional gold coins.

40:12.750 --> 40:15.319
A father laying down his life for his son,

40:15.450 --> 40:18.017
it's been done, there's no surprises there.

40:18.098 --> 40:20.640
But you, Calvin, willing
to lay down your life

40:20.712 --> 40:23.728
to avoid killing a
brother who's already dead?

40:24.584 --> 40:25.804
That's intriguing.

40:26.017 --> 40:29.462
- Who are you?
- A rose, by any other name.

40:29.569 --> 40:32.597
I have many, but that is of little matter.

40:32.950 --> 40:35.848
- What do you want?
- You in the way of what I want.

40:36.217 --> 40:38.750
See, the coins?

40:39.604 --> 40:44.716
These were just the way of luring
out the so-called infernal killers.

40:45.383 --> 40:47.334
A way to get the party started.

40:49.188 --> 40:50.488
But you two...

40:51.141 --> 40:52.841
You two are different.

40:53.050 --> 40:54.450
Especially you.

40:55.270 --> 40:59.180
A man with your impressive
body of work in killing.

41:00.450 --> 41:03.427
To willingly sacrifice himself.

42:21.017 --> 42:22.150
No!

42:22.338 --> 42:23.195
Pop!

42:23.683 --> 42:25.687
No, no, Pop!

42:25.723 --> 42:27.317
- No, no!
- Oedipus.

42:27.350 --> 42:30.047
The son kills and replaces the father.

42:30.212 --> 42:32.537
I'm sorry... I'm sorry...

42:35.620 --> 42:37.358
I guess black do crack.

42:37.436 --> 42:38.770
This is not over.

42:39.183 --> 42:40.811
This is not goodbye.

42:42.443 --> 42:43.843
It's not over!

42:46.125 --> 42:47.592
I'm coming for you!

42:49.505 --> 42:50.571
I'm coming for you.
