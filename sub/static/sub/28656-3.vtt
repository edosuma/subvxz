WEBVTT

00:01.871 --> 00:03.220
Previously onElementary...WATSON: Still don't understand

00:03.264 --> 00:05.396
why you wouldn't
let Lin sell this place.

00:05.440 --> 00:07.007
This was more than
just our home for six years.

00:07.050 --> 00:08.486
This was our
laboratory.

00:08.530 --> 00:09.922
Our sanctum sanctorum.

00:09.966 --> 00:11.315
So when are you gonna
tell Sherlock?

00:11.359 --> 00:13.274
Tell him what?That you aren't happy in London.

00:13.317 --> 00:15.450
I'm fine.

00:15.493 --> 00:17.582
I know you want her here.
I want her here, too.

00:17.626 --> 00:19.584
It doesn't mean
that she belongs here.

00:19.628 --> 00:21.021
HOLMES:
Don't pack. Stay.

00:21.064 --> 00:22.326
It could be good for you.
You said in London

00:22.370 --> 00:23.327
that you missed it here.

00:23.371 --> 00:24.328
What about you?

00:24.372 --> 00:25.547
I could stay, too.

00:25.590 --> 00:26.809
I'm here to surrender myself.

00:26.852 --> 00:28.724
My name is Sherlock Holmes.

00:28.767 --> 00:31.901
I'm wanted for the murder
of Michael Rowan.

00:36.427 --> 00:39.430
Mr. Holmes.

00:39.474 --> 00:40.431
I'm Assistant Director Eagen.

00:40.475 --> 00:43.434
Yes, I, uh... I am aware.

00:43.478 --> 00:46.742
I did, after all,
request you, specifically.

00:46.785 --> 00:48.744
Ten hours ago,
I might add.

00:48.787 --> 00:50.180
I was beginning
to think your underlings

00:50.224 --> 00:51.442
hadn't delivered my message.

00:51.486 --> 00:53.444
You're lucky
I'm here at all.

00:53.488 --> 00:56.795
Confessed killers don't usually
get to demand an audience

00:56.839 --> 00:59.363
with the head
of the New York field office.

00:59.407 --> 01:01.061
And yet, you came.

01:01.104 --> 01:05.935
Mr. Holmes, you're wanted
for the murder of Michael Rowan.

01:05.978 --> 01:08.111
As I understand it, you
understood you'd be arrested

01:08.155 --> 01:09.504
for that murder,
should you ever

01:09.547 --> 01:11.549
step foot
in the United States again.

01:11.593 --> 01:13.551
So this is how it's gonna go.

01:13.595 --> 01:15.553
You said you had a statement

01:15.597 --> 01:17.468
that you could
only deliver to me?

01:17.512 --> 01:19.253
Let's have it.

01:19.296 --> 01:21.516
Then we'll get you downstairs
for processing,

01:21.559 --> 01:23.474
and you can call an attorney.

01:23.518 --> 01:24.475
No.

01:24.519 --> 01:25.650
Excuse me?

01:25.694 --> 01:27.391
Shortly before you came in,

01:27.435 --> 01:30.568
the electromagnetic whine
in that camera stopped.

01:30.612 --> 01:32.092
I can also tell

01:32.135 --> 01:34.181
that there's no one
behind that mirror.

01:34.224 --> 01:36.574
The fact that you've ensured
our privacy tells me

01:36.618 --> 01:39.360
that you know I am
Morland Holmes's son.

01:39.403 --> 01:42.276
Why would that matter?One of the side effects

01:42.319 --> 01:45.453
of spending the last year
in proximity to my father

01:45.496 --> 01:49.109
is that I became more aware
of his business dealings.

01:49.152 --> 01:51.894
For instance,
I learned that he once bribed

01:51.937 --> 01:55.506
an assistant
director of the FBI.

01:55.550 --> 01:57.552
In exchange for
his generosity,

01:57.595 --> 02:00.555
you agreed not to look into
an illicit real estate deal

02:00.598 --> 02:03.558
which had come up in an
unrelated investigation.

02:03.601 --> 02:05.168
I'm sure that
your superiors

02:05.212 --> 02:07.257
would be interested
to know that.

02:07.301 --> 02:09.868
And they would easily find proof
of the transaction

02:09.912 --> 02:12.001
should they receive a tip.

02:12.044 --> 02:14.264
What do you want?

02:14.308 --> 02:19.269
A personal matter requires that
I stay in New York for a while.

02:19.313 --> 02:21.576
The charges against me
need to go away.

02:21.619 --> 02:24.187
So in a moment, you're going
to walk out of the room,

02:24.231 --> 02:26.624
and you're going to release
me on my own recognizance.

02:26.668 --> 02:28.278
The FBI will then
issue a statement

02:28.322 --> 02:29.845
saying it made a mistake.

02:29.888 --> 02:31.412
You've realized

02:31.455 --> 02:34.458
that I provided
a false confession

02:34.502 --> 02:37.635
in a misguided attempt
to protect my partner,

02:37.679 --> 02:39.420
who is also innocent.

02:39.463 --> 02:43.075
In particular,
you will ensure that the NYPD

02:43.119 --> 02:45.513
appreciates the gravity
of your error.

02:45.556 --> 02:49.038
Any shadow of suspicion
over myself or Ms. Watson

02:49.081 --> 02:51.475
must be gone.

02:51.519 --> 02:53.042
You do know you'd be exposing

02:53.085 --> 02:55.131
your father
to criminal charges, too.

02:55.175 --> 02:57.568
He can take it.

02:57.612 --> 02:58.917
Can you?

03:07.230 --> 03:08.623
This is a nightmare.

03:08.666 --> 03:11.365
I have a buyer flying in
from Abu Dhabi today.

03:11.408 --> 03:12.757
That's a 14-hour flight.

03:12.801 --> 03:14.542
I can't exactly tell him
to turn around.

03:14.585 --> 03:16.239
He's three-quarters
of the way here.

03:16.283 --> 03:17.545
Mr. Balfour, I swear,
nothing like this

03:17.588 --> 03:19.068
has ever happened before.

03:19.111 --> 03:20.678
And how does that help me?

03:20.722 --> 03:22.767
I paid your people
to move the sculpture

03:22.811 --> 03:24.595
from my storage unit
into the showroom

03:24.639 --> 03:26.641
so I could present it
to my buyer.

03:26.684 --> 03:29.557
That is an original
Lance Petra.

03:29.600 --> 03:32.734
Do you have any idea
how much it's worth?

03:32.777 --> 03:34.257
Nothing.

03:34.301 --> 03:35.998
Nothing is what
it's worth now.

03:36.041 --> 03:38.653
Meanwhile, the fuel that
my buyer is burning coming here

03:38.696 --> 03:40.568
costs more than
what you make in a year.

03:40.611 --> 03:44.615
I wanted to go to the Harlem
storage place, but no.

03:44.659 --> 03:47.183
The buyer needed
to be near the airport.

03:47.227 --> 03:50.055
14-hour flight, and he can't
just drive into the city.

03:50.099 --> 03:51.709
Call your boss!

03:51.753 --> 03:53.407
I have been trying,
but he hasn't answered.

03:53.450 --> 03:54.886
I will try him
again right now.

03:54.930 --> 03:57.672
First thing that you tell him
when he picks up?

03:57.715 --> 04:00.631
Your insurance here
better be astronomical.

04:18.780 --> 04:21.870
Virgil?

04:59.473 --> 05:01.475
"Virgil Gwinn."

05:02.127 --> 05:04.216
He was our New York
site manager.

05:05.827 --> 05:07.307
And you're his boss?

05:07.350 --> 05:09.265
I oversee all of
Krypsona's locations

05:09.309 --> 05:11.659
in Europe and the U.S.

05:14.009 --> 05:15.880
You sure it's him?

05:15.924 --> 05:17.621
A scar on his hand.

05:17.665 --> 05:21.059
Loading dock incident
some months ago.

05:21.103 --> 05:24.324
So if this was an accident,
it's not the facility's first.

05:24.367 --> 05:27.762
Have I done something
to offend you, Mr. Holmes?

05:27.805 --> 05:30.068
You said on the phone
that you required assistance

05:30.112 --> 05:31.331
with a problem.

05:31.374 --> 05:33.376
I wouldn't be here at all
were it not

05:33.420 --> 05:34.508
for your relationship
with my father.

05:34.551 --> 05:36.510
Had you mentioned
that your problem

05:36.553 --> 05:41.384
was a corpse, I would have said,
"No. Call the police."

05:41.428 --> 05:44.909
You're familiar with the
nature of our business?

05:44.953 --> 05:48.652
Yeah. Krypsona is a storage
facility for the rich and shady.

05:48.696 --> 05:51.176
You qualify as
a foreign-trade zone,

05:51.220 --> 05:52.482
meaning as long as the items

05:52.526 --> 05:54.397
coming into the country
remain here,

05:54.441 --> 05:57.748
they are considered outside
the purview of U.S. Customs,

05:57.792 --> 06:01.535
subject to neither
inspection nor import tax.

06:01.578 --> 06:03.798
And such a designation attracts
a clientele of art smugglers,

06:03.841 --> 06:05.843
tax evaders
and money launderers.

06:05.887 --> 06:08.411
Our clients have secrets.

06:08.455 --> 06:10.195
We offer discretion.

06:10.239 --> 06:13.416
Hmm. And should this turn
into a homicide investigation,

06:13.460 --> 06:16.637
you might prefer to give them
a heads-up, would you?

06:21.859 --> 06:25.820
Didn't your security system
capture what happened?

06:25.863 --> 06:28.562
Uh, we looked when
the body was found.

06:28.605 --> 06:33.262
Our system was shut off
for some reason last night.

06:33.305 --> 06:35.220
You didn't think
that was worth mentioning?

06:35.264 --> 06:37.701
Well, I was hoping
it wasn't related.

06:37.745 --> 06:40.922
Virgil Gwinn was probably
hoping not to be murdered.

06:40.965 --> 06:43.664
Murdered. You're certain?

06:48.712 --> 06:52.237
Wool, matching that
of Gwinn's suit.

06:52.281 --> 06:56.459
Whatever happened last night,
it didn't start in here.

07:33.496 --> 07:35.455
That is a dental crown

07:35.498 --> 07:36.978
belonging
to Mr. Gwinn.

07:41.504 --> 07:43.245
He was attacked here,

07:43.288 --> 07:44.855
and then carried
into the showroom,

07:44.899 --> 07:47.510
where his death was staged
to look like an accident.

07:47.554 --> 07:51.035
Do you plan to treat
my clients as suspects?

07:51.079 --> 07:52.515
Everyone's a suspect.
Your employees are suspect.

07:52.559 --> 07:54.082
You're a suspect.

07:54.125 --> 07:56.258
Wha... I called you.

07:56.301 --> 07:57.302
You wouldn't be the first killer

07:57.346 --> 07:58.869
to bring me in
out of pure swank.

07:58.913 --> 08:00.523
A retired colorman
once did so

08:00.567 --> 08:02.264
after asphyxiating his wife
and her lover.

08:02.307 --> 08:04.179
I found them in a well
in his garden.

08:04.222 --> 08:06.398
That being said,
on a fundamental level,

08:06.442 --> 08:08.749
Krypsona is a facility
where valuables are stored,

08:08.792 --> 08:10.838
and Mr. Gwinn was charged
with protecting them.

08:10.881 --> 08:12.404
And I'm sure the NYPD

08:12.448 --> 08:14.406
will want to determine
if anything is missing,

08:14.450 --> 08:16.539
in case he was killed
during a theft.

08:16.583 --> 08:18.585
You're contacting them now?

08:18.628 --> 08:20.587
No. I'm contacting my partner.

08:20.630 --> 08:22.414
She'll call them.

08:22.458 --> 08:25.635
As far as anyone need know,
you called looking for me,

08:25.679 --> 08:27.942
but you found her instead,
all right?

08:27.985 --> 08:31.554
And I suppose they'll want
a list of our clients' names?

08:31.598 --> 08:33.774
Yeah.Well, I can't
give them one.

08:33.817 --> 08:35.427
I'm contractually forbidden.

08:35.471 --> 08:37.560
Well, in that case,
you'll be given a court order,

08:37.604 --> 08:39.649
absolving you of any need
for confidentiality.

08:39.693 --> 08:41.782
Now, before the police
get here, I need copies

08:41.825 --> 08:44.262
of all of this facility's
security video.

08:44.306 --> 08:46.395
The killer might have avoided
the cameras last night,

08:46.438 --> 08:49.920
but who knows what I'll find
on previous days?

09:02.280 --> 09:03.847
Sherlock?

09:03.891 --> 09:05.893
HOLMES:
Up here!

09:15.380 --> 09:17.121
All the furniture's back.

09:17.165 --> 09:19.559
While you and Marcus were
at Krypsona, I took the liberty

09:19.602 --> 09:21.561
of having our things
delivered from storage.

09:21.604 --> 09:23.301
I was only gone a few hours.

09:23.345 --> 09:24.999
You think I would
hire slow movers?

09:25.042 --> 09:28.568
My only quibble is damage
to some of the cables.

09:28.611 --> 09:30.570
Our belongings are the tools
of our trade, Watson.

09:30.613 --> 09:32.876
We need them to do our work.

09:32.920 --> 09:34.791
Because, apparently,
we're taking cases now.

09:34.835 --> 09:36.793
A dead body came over
our transom.

09:36.837 --> 09:39.187
I decided not to throw it back.

09:39.230 --> 09:40.492
Speaking of which...

09:40.536 --> 09:41.972
It's like you said.

09:42.016 --> 09:44.192
Virgil Gwinn's death
looks like a homicide.

09:44.235 --> 09:46.150
Eugene thinks
that his neck was broken

09:46.194 --> 09:48.152
before he was crushed
under the sculpture.

09:48.196 --> 09:50.372
The killer wanted it
to look like an accident.

09:50.415 --> 09:52.200
And Krypsona's shadowy
client list?

09:52.243 --> 09:54.028
Marcus got a court order.
They handed it over.

09:54.071 --> 09:55.682
So he's been calling
each of the clients

09:55.725 --> 09:57.335
to see if police
can inspect their units.

09:57.379 --> 09:59.294
So far, no one is cooperating.

09:59.337 --> 10:00.991
As predicted.

10:01.035 --> 10:03.254
He also posted unis
at the facility.

10:03.298 --> 10:05.300
So if anyone tries to get into
their unit without the police,

10:05.343 --> 10:06.954
they'll be stopped
and we'll hear about it.

10:06.997 --> 10:08.259
How about you?

10:08.303 --> 10:10.392
Anything interesting
in the footage?

10:10.435 --> 10:12.394
Many things.
Or rather, many non-things.

10:12.437 --> 10:14.962
The night of Gwinn's murder
is not the first time

10:15.005 --> 10:17.617
someone tampered with
the security system at Krypsona.

10:17.660 --> 10:20.707
I've found gaps in the footage
going back over a year.

10:20.750 --> 10:22.709
So we're looking
at a string of break-ins.

10:22.752 --> 10:24.536
Last night was the first
time they caught on?

10:24.580 --> 10:25.842
It's got to be
an inside job, right?

10:25.886 --> 10:27.365
That's how they're
turning off the cameras.

10:27.409 --> 10:28.540
Either that, or the
killer was a professional

10:28.584 --> 10:30.064
with the right expertise.

10:30.107 --> 10:31.456
I'm still reviewing
the footage, so...

10:31.500 --> 10:33.633
It's too soon to say.

10:35.460 --> 10:36.984
So, now can we talk about why

10:37.027 --> 10:38.942
you didn't get on a plane
to London yesterday?

10:38.986 --> 10:40.988
Change of heart.

10:41.031 --> 10:42.250
I thought you and I both agreed

10:42.293 --> 10:43.773
that you can't stay here.
The FBI...

10:43.817 --> 10:46.384
They're already aware
of my presence.

10:46.428 --> 10:48.343
Turned myself in yesterday.

10:50.432 --> 10:51.607
Wha...?

10:51.651 --> 10:54.479
What if your
plan backfired?

10:54.523 --> 10:56.264
What if they arrested you?They didn't.

10:56.307 --> 10:58.396
Why risk it?
Because questions
still remain

10:58.440 --> 11:00.311
about what happened
to the captain.

11:00.355 --> 11:02.052
Patrick Meers
was not acting alone.

11:02.096 --> 11:04.881
Someone or some group
were pulling his strings.

11:04.925 --> 11:06.317
We both know I can't
return to London

11:06.361 --> 11:08.102
with things as they are,

11:08.145 --> 11:10.626
and we can't investigate
properly with me slinking about.

11:12.323 --> 11:14.064
What's the latest
on the captain?

11:14.108 --> 11:15.675
He's stable.

11:15.718 --> 11:17.415
I mean, he still has to
be intubated, though,

11:17.459 --> 11:20.114
so they're keeping
him sedated.

11:23.117 --> 11:26.076
It's Marcus. One of
Krypsona's clients

11:26.120 --> 11:28.209
has agreed to let the
police inspect his unit.

11:28.252 --> 11:30.864
I've been
invited to join.

11:30.907 --> 11:33.475
BELL: We appreciate you
helping us out, Mr. Cutler.

11:35.782 --> 11:38.872
Seems like a lot
of the renters here aren't keen

11:38.915 --> 11:41.091
on the police looking
through their stuff.

11:41.135 --> 11:42.919
I have got nothing
to hide, Detective.

11:42.963 --> 11:44.878
WATSON:
Can I ask why

11:44.921 --> 11:46.749
you keep your coins
in a foreign trade zone?

11:46.793 --> 11:49.709
I picked most of them up
in other countries,

11:49.752 --> 11:51.362
and they're worth
a lot of money.

11:51.406 --> 11:53.190
Most of them are gold.

11:53.234 --> 11:55.018
If I never bring
them through Customs,

11:55.062 --> 11:56.628
then I don't have
to declare them.

11:56.672 --> 11:58.413
It's perfectly legal.

11:58.456 --> 12:00.894
I-I'm not a criminal.
I'm just cheap.

12:00.937 --> 12:02.286
And it's just as easy

12:02.330 --> 12:06.029
to admire them here
as it is at home.

12:06.073 --> 12:09.772
Some of the locks have been
picked on these cases.

12:09.816 --> 12:11.339
You can see the scratches.

12:15.865 --> 12:17.301
Over here, too.

12:17.345 --> 12:19.434
Someone pried
these open.

12:19.477 --> 12:21.001
Probably with a screwdriver.

12:21.044 --> 12:23.307
Got to think the perp
was our doer, right?

12:23.351 --> 12:24.874
He was ripping off
these storage units

12:24.918 --> 12:26.833
when the site manager
caught him in the act.

12:26.876 --> 12:28.791
Do us a favor,
Mr. Cutler,

12:28.835 --> 12:31.663
and write us up a list of
everything you find missing.

12:31.707 --> 12:35.711
I'd be happy to, except
so far, everything's here.

12:35.755 --> 12:37.017
You sure?

12:37.060 --> 12:38.322
I'll have to go
through it all,

12:38.366 --> 12:41.412
but from what I can see,
nothing's missing.

12:41.456 --> 12:43.240
WATSON: That doesn't
make any sense.

12:43.284 --> 12:45.286
I mean, even if you don't know
anything about coins,

12:45.329 --> 12:46.940
you can see that these
are worth stealing.

12:46.983 --> 12:49.116
And given the number of locks
that were picked,

12:49.159 --> 12:51.640
whoever broke in here
stuck around for a while.

12:51.683 --> 12:55.078
So why go through all that
trouble and not take anything?

13:07.874 --> 13:10.137
Thanks for the lift.

13:10.180 --> 13:14.184
Yeah. Hey, any chance you
have a printer set up inside?

13:14.228 --> 13:17.492
Supposed to meet Chantal at
a comedy club in 20 minutes,

13:17.535 --> 13:20.364
and I forgot to print our
tickets off the website.

13:20.408 --> 13:22.497
It would save me from having
to stop somewhere else,

13:22.540 --> 13:23.846
miss half the show.

13:23.890 --> 13:25.413
Um, well, just tell me
the site's address,

13:25.456 --> 13:27.067
and I'll print them out.
You can wait here.

13:27.110 --> 13:29.939
I would, but it's probably
gonna take me a dozen tries

13:29.983 --> 13:31.375
to remember my password.

13:31.419 --> 13:34.030
I could just come
inside and do it.

13:37.599 --> 13:40.167
Joan.

13:40.210 --> 13:43.039
I know he's here.

13:44.562 --> 13:46.086
I hope you brought
some food, Watson.

13:46.129 --> 13:47.478
BELL:
No food.

13:47.522 --> 13:49.002
Just company.

13:49.045 --> 13:50.307
He knew you were here.

13:52.005 --> 13:54.877
I realize this puts you
in an awkward spot, Marcus.

13:58.925 --> 14:01.710
It's been a year, man.

14:01.753 --> 14:04.191
You really gonna
leave me hanging?

14:05.496 --> 14:07.498
You knew I was here
the whole time, didn't you?

14:07.542 --> 14:09.065
BELL:
It was the captain.

14:09.109 --> 14:10.197
I knew you'd come.

14:10.240 --> 14:11.372
I was counting on it.

14:11.415 --> 14:13.591
It's good to see you.

14:13.635 --> 14:15.115
I was disappointed to hear
about the Marshals,

14:15.158 --> 14:17.291
but I do understand.

14:17.334 --> 14:18.901
Be grateful.

14:18.945 --> 14:20.598
If I was a federal officer
right now,

14:20.642 --> 14:22.078
I'd have to arrest you.

14:22.122 --> 14:23.297
On that count, you won't be

14:23.340 --> 14:25.168
abetting a fugitive
for too long.

14:25.212 --> 14:28.084
Wheels are in motion to clear me
in the eyes of the law.

14:28.128 --> 14:29.172
Do I even want to know?

14:29.216 --> 14:31.218
Probably never.

14:31.261 --> 14:33.698
Then what? You back?

14:33.742 --> 14:35.135
We haven't talked
about that yet.

14:35.178 --> 14:36.310
We were only planning

14:36.353 --> 14:37.964
to see this Patrick
Meers thing through.

14:38.007 --> 14:39.400
This just came up.

14:39.443 --> 14:42.142
Watson texted me about
the storage unit you examined.

14:42.185 --> 14:45.406
The man's coin collection
was rifled but not robbed?

14:45.449 --> 14:48.061
I think I have an explanation.

14:48.104 --> 14:51.412
You'll recall I discovered gaps
in the security footage

14:51.455 --> 14:53.414
that we received from Krypsona.

14:53.457 --> 14:57.592
Well, I've since discovered
a related pattern elsewhere

14:57.635 --> 15:02.075
in the financial records
of our flattened victim.

15:02.118 --> 15:04.164
WATSON:
Well, according to these,

15:04.207 --> 15:08.081
Virgil Gwinn bought a lake house
in Saskatchewan last year.

15:08.124 --> 15:10.300
And then this year,
he bought a $100,000 Tesla

15:10.344 --> 15:12.041
and a luxury cruise.

15:12.085 --> 15:13.216
Note the dates.

15:13.260 --> 15:15.044
Each of his
extravagant purchases

15:15.088 --> 15:18.047
was made shortly after
one of the gaps in the footage.

15:18.091 --> 15:20.615
So every time the cameras
went off, Virgil got richer.

15:20.658 --> 15:22.312
He was the one disabling
the security system

15:22.356 --> 15:24.445
because he was stealing
from people's units.

15:24.488 --> 15:25.968
HOLMES:
Not exactly.

15:26.012 --> 15:27.274
I don't think he was
stealing objects.

15:27.317 --> 15:28.840
I think he was
after information.

15:28.884 --> 15:32.018
Krypsona caters
to clients with secrets.

15:32.061 --> 15:34.890
WATSON: If secrets were all
an intruder was after,

15:34.934 --> 15:36.196
then it would
explain why none

15:36.239 --> 15:38.067
of Edward Cutler's coins
were taken.

15:38.111 --> 15:40.243
BELL: You think
Virgil was going

15:40.287 --> 15:42.463
through people's units to
see what they were hiding.

15:42.506 --> 15:45.466
If he found a good secret, he'd
use it to shake down the client?

15:45.509 --> 15:47.250
HOLMES: Yeah.
He was a blackmailer.

15:47.294 --> 15:50.558
And if I'm right, he was killed
by one of his victims.

16:00.133 --> 16:01.612
Hey. Ready to go?

16:01.656 --> 16:03.527
Mm-hmm.

16:03.571 --> 16:05.094
WATSON: So that's
Captain Dwyer?

16:05.138 --> 16:07.401
Strange seeing someone else
in that office.

16:07.444 --> 16:09.272
He's the C.O. at the 12th.

16:09.316 --> 16:11.144
He's going to cover
both squads--

16:11.187 --> 16:12.841
half tour here,
half tour there--

16:12.884 --> 16:14.930
until we know more
about Captain Gregson.

16:14.974 --> 16:16.758
He's getting briefed
on all our open cases.

16:16.801 --> 16:18.194
Pretty sure you
and I are next.

16:18.238 --> 16:20.414
Do we know anything
about him?

16:20.457 --> 16:22.024
I hear he's a good boss.

16:22.068 --> 16:23.895
You don't get tapped
in a situation like this

16:23.939 --> 16:25.027
if you aren't.

16:25.071 --> 16:26.855
When I texted my buddy
at the 12th,

16:26.898 --> 16:28.770
all he said was that
Dwyer doesn't mince words.

16:28.813 --> 16:30.032
What does that mean?

16:30.076 --> 16:32.774
Guess we're about
to find out.

16:32.817 --> 16:35.124
Detective Bell,
you're up.

16:35.168 --> 16:36.865
Uh, Captain Dwyer,
this is Joan Watson.

16:36.908 --> 16:38.214
Hello.

16:38.258 --> 16:40.086
I forget. You the one
who murdered that guy,

16:40.129 --> 16:41.739
or was it your partner?

16:41.783 --> 16:43.176
Between us,
I don't care.

16:43.219 --> 16:45.134
The guy was a twist.
I'm glad he's dead.

16:45.178 --> 16:47.049
Thanks.
I've been
on the job 40 years.

16:47.093 --> 16:49.008
You're my first
consulting detective.

16:49.051 --> 16:50.357
I think it's nuts, by the way,

16:50.400 --> 16:52.054
working cases
with civilians,

16:52.098 --> 16:53.708
but this isn't my house;
it's Tommy's,

16:53.751 --> 16:55.492
and it isn't like
there's any arguing

16:55.536 --> 16:57.103
with your results, am I right?

16:58.582 --> 17:00.280
Shall we?

17:00.323 --> 17:02.934
Uh, actually, Captain,
we set everything up

17:02.978 --> 17:05.067
in the conference
room for you.

17:05.111 --> 17:07.200
"Set everything up"?

17:12.074 --> 17:14.076
What the hell
is all this?

17:14.120 --> 17:16.252
You asked for a briefing
on the case.

17:16.296 --> 17:17.340
Yeah, briefing.

17:17.384 --> 17:19.212
This look brief to you?No, but...

17:19.255 --> 17:21.170
Look, I'm a 30,000-foot guy.

17:21.214 --> 17:22.476
I only need details
when I need them.

17:22.519 --> 17:24.478
Right now I'm running two squads
instead of one.

17:24.521 --> 17:27.655
It's a homicide.
You got a handle on it?

17:27.698 --> 17:29.222
Early days, but we think so.

17:29.265 --> 17:31.050
Good. Let me know
if that changes.

17:31.093 --> 17:32.877
Otherwise, Tommy trusts you.

17:32.921 --> 17:35.054
That's good enough for me.

17:47.196 --> 17:49.590
First impressions of
our interim captain?

17:49.633 --> 17:51.374
It's hard to say.

17:51.418 --> 17:54.247
The meeting was so quick.

17:54.290 --> 17:57.293
So did he grasp why we suspect
Virgil Gwinn was murdered

17:57.337 --> 17:58.816
by one of Krypsona's
clientele?

17:58.860 --> 18:00.644
Actually, we never got that far.

18:00.688 --> 18:02.951
Something about Captain Dwyer
being a 30,000-foot guy.

18:02.994 --> 18:05.301
What does that mean?I think it's
supposed to mean

18:05.345 --> 18:06.998
the view from an airplane,

18:07.042 --> 18:10.263
but he may as well have been
on one, he sped by so fast.

18:10.306 --> 18:12.265
But he said he trusts us.

18:12.308 --> 18:14.136
Well, then I suppose he'll do.

18:14.180 --> 18:15.485
So I've managed to eliminate

18:15.529 --> 18:17.574
all but one of these individuals
as a suspect.

18:17.618 --> 18:20.969
Noam Alsberg is,
according to my source,

18:21.012 --> 18:23.493
a money launderer for a Serbian
gang, and they are in the habit

18:23.537 --> 18:25.756
of disappearing their victims.

18:25.800 --> 18:27.802
So they wouldn't have left
Virgil's body to be found.

18:27.845 --> 18:29.543
Hmm. These three
are cooperating

18:29.586 --> 18:31.806
with the investigation,
so it's unlikely

18:31.849 --> 18:34.243
they've got anything to hide
worth blackmailing.

18:34.287 --> 18:36.158
These two may well
have something to hide,

18:36.202 --> 18:39.161
but they are Krypsona's
newest clients.

18:39.205 --> 18:40.554
I didn't find any gaps
in the security footage

18:40.597 --> 18:41.946
between the time they moved in

18:41.990 --> 18:43.513
and the time of the murder.

18:43.557 --> 18:45.733
Meaning Virgil hadn't gotten
around to searching their units

18:45.776 --> 18:47.169
in order to blackmail them.

18:47.213 --> 18:49.171
You said you eliminated
all but one.

18:49.215 --> 18:52.348
Aura Swenson, heiress to the
Swenson Construction fortune,

18:52.392 --> 18:56.439
but money's not the only
thing in her inheritance.

18:56.483 --> 18:59.355
Her father, Harold Swenson,

18:59.399 --> 19:01.357
built one of the world's
largest construction companies

19:01.401 --> 19:04.882
by doing business primarily
in Africa and the Middle East.

19:04.926 --> 19:07.668
His vocation allowed him
to indulge his avocation:

19:07.711 --> 19:09.191
everywhere he built
roads and bridges,

19:09.235 --> 19:10.410
he procured religious artifacts.

19:10.453 --> 19:12.455
WATSON: I remember
hearing about this.

19:12.499 --> 19:15.284
He wanted to build a museum
focusing on the religions

19:15.328 --> 19:16.894
that came out of the region,

19:16.938 --> 19:18.548
but he died before
he had the chance.

19:18.592 --> 19:22.987
Mm. His daughter has decided
to carry on her father's dream.

19:23.031 --> 19:24.728
Says here the dad got
in trouble with the Feds

19:24.772 --> 19:26.034
about ten years back.

19:26.077 --> 19:27.992
He was caught importing
looted antiquities,

19:28.036 --> 19:29.298
got off with a...

19:29.342 --> 19:31.953
slap on the wrist
and a minor fine.

19:31.996 --> 19:34.695
Afterwards, he claimed to stay
on the straight and narrow.

19:34.738 --> 19:36.000
So you think his collection

19:36.044 --> 19:37.611
is being kept in
his daughter's unit.

19:37.654 --> 19:39.134
But if it's so squeaky clean,

19:39.178 --> 19:41.484
then why is it in a
foreign trade zone,

19:41.528 --> 19:44.270
and why won't he cooperate
with the murder investigation?

19:44.313 --> 19:47.098
If the Swenson family is still
in possession of looted goods,

19:47.142 --> 19:48.796
it would count
as a second offense.

19:48.839 --> 19:50.363
She could get prison time.

19:50.406 --> 19:54.062
Secret worthy of blackmail
and, by extension, murder.

19:54.105 --> 19:56.325
Well, we can't prove any of this
without access to her unit.

19:56.369 --> 19:58.719
And these articles aren't going
to get us a search warrant.

19:58.762 --> 20:00.155
I could talk to Captain Dwyer,

20:00.199 --> 20:02.070
try to put some pressure
on Aura Swenson,

20:02.113 --> 20:03.593
but I'm not liking our chances.

20:03.637 --> 20:05.813
There might be another way
we could test the theory.

20:05.856 --> 20:08.381
According to these articles,
she engaged an appraiser

20:08.424 --> 20:10.252
to inventory
her father's collection.

20:10.296 --> 20:13.473
The appraiser's
website, however...

20:15.170 --> 20:18.086
...fails to list her
as a client.

20:18.129 --> 20:19.435
That's a curious
omission, isn't it,

20:19.479 --> 20:21.829
given the notoriety
of the Swenson name?

20:21.872 --> 20:25.354
So you think he's distancing
himself from her for a reason.

20:25.398 --> 20:27.878
Well, she likely
won't cooperate.

20:27.922 --> 20:30.577
Perhaps the
appraiser will.

20:36.713 --> 20:39.107
Detective Bell?

20:39.150 --> 20:40.935
Hi. And Miss Watson.Hello.

20:40.978 --> 20:43.677
You said on the phone
that you wanted to talk

20:43.720 --> 20:45.853
about the Swenson collection?That's right.

20:45.896 --> 20:47.942
Go ahead and come back
into my office with me.

20:47.985 --> 20:50.292
I just want to be clear
right out of the gate

20:50.336 --> 20:52.425
that I wanted no
part of that mess.

20:52.468 --> 20:54.601
BELL: When you say "mess,"
Mr. Florenti,

20:54.644 --> 20:56.080
are you talking about
looted antiquities

20:56.124 --> 20:58.082
or the murder
of Virgil Gwinn?

20:58.126 --> 20:59.475
Wait, murder?

21:01.042 --> 21:04.437
Virgil, the site manager
at Krypsona? He's dead?

21:04.480 --> 21:05.481
You knew him?

21:05.525 --> 21:07.309
To say hello.

21:07.353 --> 21:09.920
I-I couldn't remove anything
from the building,

21:09.964 --> 21:11.748
so I had to examine
the collection there.

21:11.792 --> 21:14.011
We have reason to believe
that his murder

21:14.055 --> 21:15.665
and the collection are related.

21:15.709 --> 21:17.145
We were hoping
that you can confirm

21:17.188 --> 21:19.147
that some of
the Swenson antiquities

21:19.190 --> 21:21.149
were smuggled
into the country illegally.

21:21.192 --> 21:24.805
Are you saying you think
Aura Swenson killed him?

21:24.848 --> 21:26.110
BELL: If we were
thinking that,

21:26.154 --> 21:28.156
would we be off base?

21:28.199 --> 21:30.985
You asked if I saw
looted antiquities.

21:31.028 --> 21:32.943
Yeah, I did.

21:32.987 --> 21:34.815
That's what I wanted no part of.

21:34.858 --> 21:38.297
A lot of the Swenson collection
comes from a border territory

21:38.340 --> 21:41.300
between Ethiopia
and its neighbor, Eritrea.

21:41.343 --> 21:43.519
I worked in that region
for years, so Aura hired me

21:43.563 --> 21:45.129
for my expertise.

21:45.173 --> 21:47.784
Eritrea used to be
part of Ethiopia,

21:47.828 --> 21:49.917
but they declared independence
25 years ago,

21:49.960 --> 21:52.311
and the two countries
have been at war ever since.

21:52.354 --> 21:54.138
There hasn't been any

21:54.182 --> 21:55.966
government-sanctioned
archaeology

21:56.010 --> 21:58.186
in the region during
that time, so...

21:58.229 --> 21:59.927
when I saw that Harold Swenson

21:59.970 --> 22:02.146
had brought in pieces
less than five years ago...

22:02.190 --> 22:04.061
You knew they had
to have been looted.

22:04.105 --> 22:05.280
I don't think Aura knew.

22:05.324 --> 22:07.587
She just inherited
everything from her dad.

22:07.630 --> 22:11.155
But when I told her,
she offered to pay me

22:11.199 --> 22:12.896
to forge papers of provenance.

22:12.940 --> 22:15.029
She wanted you to cover up
her father's crimes.

22:15.072 --> 22:16.335
I told her I wouldn't,

22:16.378 --> 22:18.380
and she was furious.

22:18.424 --> 22:20.077
I quit on the spot.

22:20.121 --> 22:23.124
Would you be willing
to tell a judge everything

22:23.167 --> 22:24.647
you just told us?

22:24.691 --> 22:26.693
It could help police
secure a search warrant.

22:26.736 --> 22:28.651
Of course.Actually,

22:28.695 --> 22:31.045
looks like we won't
need a warrant.

22:31.088 --> 22:33.482
Aura Swenson's lawyer
just called the precinct.

22:33.526 --> 22:37.268
They've agreed to give us
full access to her unit.

22:38.313 --> 22:39.749
So you're admitting

22:39.793 --> 22:41.403
to everything
your appraiser told us?

22:41.447 --> 22:43.318
That several of these items
are missing the paperwork

22:43.362 --> 22:45.494
needed to bring them legally
into the U.S.?

22:45.538 --> 22:48.105
WATSON:
All right, you realize
you're confessing

22:48.149 --> 22:49.759
to a federal crime,
and confirming a motive

22:49.803 --> 22:51.065
to kill Virgil Gwinn?

22:51.108 --> 22:52.545
What motive is that?

22:52.588 --> 22:55.069
We think Virgil Gwinn knew
you had looted items in here,

22:55.112 --> 22:56.679
items you could
go to prison for,

22:56.723 --> 22:59.160
and that he was blackmailing you
to keep it secret.

23:01.249 --> 23:03.425
We can't speak to anything
that transpired

23:03.469 --> 23:05.819
between this man
and Aura's father.

23:05.862 --> 23:08.430
It's possible Harold
was being blackmailed,

23:08.474 --> 23:10.258
but this is the first
we're hearing of it.

23:10.301 --> 23:12.347
The fact is, I let
you in here to prove

23:12.391 --> 23:13.827
that I wasn't
committing any crime.

23:13.870 --> 23:15.568
And since that's the case,
there's nothing

23:15.611 --> 23:18.397
that I could be
blackmailed over, either.

23:18.440 --> 23:20.094
I'm confused.
How could your father

23:20.137 --> 23:21.878
have been susceptible
to blackmail, but not you?

23:21.922 --> 23:24.141
You just said that the
looted items are still here.

23:24.185 --> 23:28.145
Because we finalized a deal
with the Ethiopian government

23:28.189 --> 23:31.671
this morning that obviates any
crimes on Ms. Swenson's part.

23:31.714 --> 23:33.542
BELL:
Care to explain
how a deal

23:33.586 --> 23:35.979
with a foreign country
saves you from facing charges

23:36.023 --> 23:37.459
on U.S. soil?

23:37.503 --> 23:40.201
A few months ago,
the U.N. brokered a peace deal

23:40.244 --> 23:42.769
between Ethiopia
and Eritrea,

23:42.812 --> 23:45.032
ending a lengthy conflict.
With the fighting over,

23:45.075 --> 23:48.818
Ethiopia now has a chance
to repair its infrastructure.

23:48.862 --> 23:51.865
Which just happens to be
your family's line of work.

23:51.908 --> 23:54.781
In exchange for
Swenson Construction's

23:54.824 --> 23:56.304
generous assistance

23:56.347 --> 23:59.655
building new housing,
parks and power plants,

23:59.699 --> 24:03.311
Ethiopia has agreed to
donate any and all items

24:03.354 --> 24:05.400
that might have been looted
to the Swensons' museum.

24:05.444 --> 24:07.010
And since none
of the items

24:07.054 --> 24:09.535
in here have left the
foreign trade zone...

24:09.578 --> 24:11.362
Technically, none of these items
have been smuggled

24:11.406 --> 24:12.581
into the country illegally.

24:12.625 --> 24:15.105
So this deal makes it legal?

24:15.149 --> 24:17.934
And since this deal has been
in the works for weeks,

24:17.978 --> 24:21.721
Ms. Swenson had no motive
to kill any blackmailer.

24:28.989 --> 24:32.166
That's the first time I've heard
of a country giving an alibi.

24:32.209 --> 24:34.298
This all looks legit,
but I'm no expert,

24:34.342 --> 24:36.344
and there's a lot
of inventory in there.

24:36.387 --> 24:38.694
It'd be nice to know if this
really means there's nothing

24:38.738 --> 24:40.740
Ms. Swenson could've been
blackmailed over.

24:40.783 --> 24:42.611
I'll call the department's
art expert,

24:42.655 --> 24:44.221
ask him to help us
go through it.

24:44.265 --> 24:46.049
We should also make
sure this really came

24:46.093 --> 24:47.747
from the Ethiopian
government.

24:47.790 --> 24:50.967
I'll call Sherlock and ask him
to swing by the consulate.

24:53.230 --> 24:55.145
EAGEN : Eagen.

24:55.189 --> 24:57.365
HOLMES: Assistant Director,
it's Sherlock Holmes.

24:57.408 --> 24:58.845
You shouldn't be calling me.

24:58.888 --> 25:00.629
I wouldn't be if my situation
was resolved.

25:00.673 --> 25:01.935
I'm working on it.

25:01.978 --> 25:02.979
Well, work faster.

25:03.023 --> 25:04.285
I'm not sure how much longer

25:04.328 --> 25:05.678
I can be trusted
to keep your secret.

25:05.721 --> 25:08.811
24 hours, and it'll be done.

25:08.855 --> 25:10.117
Excuse me.

25:10.160 --> 25:12.293
Hello. Um, my name's
Sherlock Holmes.

25:12.336 --> 25:15.252
I've got an appointment to speak
with consul. Isn't that her?

25:15.296 --> 25:17.690
Mr. Holmes,
I recognize the name.

25:17.733 --> 25:20.257
I'm sorry, but the consul
has been called to the U.N.

25:20.301 --> 25:21.650
She'll have to
reschedule.

25:21.694 --> 25:22.956
Is everything all right?

25:22.999 --> 25:24.653
This went out to
the press an hour ago.

25:24.697 --> 25:26.350
It should explain everything.

25:47.807 --> 25:51.680
Hey. How did it go
with the Ethiopian consul?

25:51.724 --> 25:53.203
She wasn't able to speak.

25:53.247 --> 25:54.553
She was called away
on urgent business.

25:54.596 --> 25:56.337
Her prime minister
just pulled out

25:56.380 --> 25:58.295
of a peace deal with Eritrea.

25:58.339 --> 25:59.340
Really?

25:59.383 --> 26:00.863
That means something to you?

26:00.907 --> 26:02.473
Yeah. I was about to call you.

26:02.517 --> 26:04.563
I think I may know why
they pulled out

26:04.606 --> 26:06.390
of the peace deal,
and if I'm right,

26:06.434 --> 26:08.610
it might tell us why
Virgil Gwinn was murdered.

26:08.654 --> 26:10.090
I'm listening.

26:10.133 --> 26:12.266
The Swenson collection
included a journal

26:12.309 --> 26:15.399
written by an archaeologist
in 1928.

26:15.443 --> 26:18.446
So there is this one entry:
he and his team are digging in

26:18.489 --> 26:22.450
what is now the disputed area
between Ethiopia and Eritrea.

26:22.493 --> 26:25.801
So he wrote that they
came across "bitumen seepage"

26:25.845 --> 26:28.412
and the "odor of methane gas."

26:28.456 --> 26:30.284
You're thinking antiquities
aren't the only thing

26:30.327 --> 26:32.286
people dig for in that region
worth killing over.

26:32.329 --> 26:36.116
Bitumen and methane
are indicators of fossil fuels.

26:36.159 --> 26:37.987
So what if Virgil
went digging for dirt

26:38.031 --> 26:40.207
in Swenson's collection,
and instead

26:40.250 --> 26:41.556
struck oil?

26:50.913 --> 26:52.828
Where did you
get this?

26:52.872 --> 26:56.005
It's funny, we were gonna
ask you the same thing.

26:56.049 --> 26:59.226
That is a copy of a page from
an archaeologist's journal.

26:59.269 --> 27:00.706
We got it from
Aura Swenson.

27:00.749 --> 27:03.665
It was in her father's
collection of antiquities.

27:03.709 --> 27:05.406
Now, the archaeologist
described

27:05.449 --> 27:07.669
what he thought could be oil
along the border

27:07.713 --> 27:10.106
between your country
and Eritrea.

27:10.150 --> 27:12.326
An area which,
up until yesterday,

27:12.369 --> 27:14.676
your country agreed
to hand over to Eritrea

27:14.720 --> 27:15.851
as part of a peace deal.

27:15.895 --> 27:18.549
We can't help thinking
it's all related,

27:18.593 --> 27:20.377
this info about the oil

27:20.421 --> 27:23.816
and your prime minister suddenly
refusing to give up the land.

27:23.859 --> 27:28.690
I must admit,
I am a bit puzzled.

27:28.734 --> 27:31.258
Why are the affairs
of two African nations

27:31.301 --> 27:34.087
of any concern to the NYPD?Because they're
relevant

27:34.130 --> 27:36.698
to a homicide investigation.

27:36.742 --> 27:38.874
We're looking into the murder
of a man named Virgil Gwinn.

27:38.918 --> 27:40.180
Maybe you've heard of him?

27:42.312 --> 27:44.314
Well, we think Mr. Gwinn
came across that journal

27:44.358 --> 27:47.056
in a storage unit where the
Swensons' collection is held.

27:47.100 --> 27:49.842
We also think he tried to sell
the information in it

27:49.885 --> 27:51.626
to your country.

27:51.670 --> 27:54.498
Maybe you liked the information
but not the price.

27:54.542 --> 27:57.719
So you took it
and you had him killed instead.

27:59.634 --> 28:03.725
I believe this conversation
just ended.

28:03.769 --> 28:07.686
You probably don't want
word of oil in the region

28:07.729 --> 28:09.818
getting around, right?

28:09.862 --> 28:11.472
For example,
I'm thinking Eritrea

28:11.515 --> 28:13.735
would be very interested
to hear about it.

28:13.779 --> 28:16.695
Their consulate's
just down the street, isn't it?

28:18.566 --> 28:22.048
In truth, you're
only partly right

28:22.091 --> 28:24.224
about what you have said.

28:24.267 --> 28:26.835
My country was alerted
to the possibility

28:26.879 --> 28:28.619
of oil in the region,

28:28.663 --> 28:30.099
and that is why
we rejected

28:30.143 --> 28:32.058
the peace deal.

28:32.101 --> 28:33.755
As I understand it,

28:33.799 --> 28:36.671
our prime minister
received a copy of this same

28:36.715 --> 28:39.195
journal directly
from a high-level

28:39.239 --> 28:41.632
business associate, but...

28:41.676 --> 28:44.287
where that man acquired it,

28:44.331 --> 28:47.769
or whether he knew
your murder victim,

28:47.813 --> 28:49.640
I cannot say.

28:49.684 --> 28:51.860
Obviously, you've heard
of the Swenson family

28:51.904 --> 28:55.037
and you know about the agreement
to donate antiquities to them

28:55.081 --> 28:57.518
in exchange for help
from their construction company.

28:57.561 --> 29:00.782
Yes, but I was unaware
of any connection

29:00.826 --> 29:03.350
between the Swensons' collection
and this information.

29:03.393 --> 29:07.746
What I can say
with great certainty

29:07.789 --> 29:10.792
is that no one
from my government

29:10.836 --> 29:12.751
ordered any murder.

29:12.794 --> 29:14.230
We'll need the name

29:14.274 --> 29:16.755
of your prime minister's
business associate.

29:18.800 --> 29:20.802
I can give you that,

29:20.846 --> 29:22.804
as long as you'll agree

29:22.848 --> 29:26.373
not to divulge
what you know to Eritrea.

29:32.596 --> 29:34.598
She gave us the name
of a prominent

29:34.642 --> 29:36.775
Ethiopian businessman.
Apparently, he's the one

29:36.818 --> 29:38.124
who passed the info
in the journal

29:38.167 --> 29:39.778
on to their prime minister.

29:39.821 --> 29:41.475
Well, that's progress.

29:41.518 --> 29:42.824
You seem troubled.

29:42.868 --> 29:44.347
The consul doesn't
seem to think

29:44.391 --> 29:45.827
there's a connection
between the information

29:45.871 --> 29:48.221
reaching her government
and Virgil Gwinn's murder.

29:48.264 --> 29:51.572
Her ignorance of such matters
doesn't disprove them.

29:51.615 --> 29:53.400
Well, I looked into where
the journal came from.

29:53.443 --> 29:55.054
It's been sitting
in the Swenson collection,

29:55.097 --> 29:56.707
gathering dust,
for a decade.

29:56.751 --> 29:58.579
Before then,
Harold Swenson bought it

29:58.622 --> 30:00.276
from a private collector
in Italy,

30:00.320 --> 30:02.583
who had been holding
onto it for 75 years.

30:02.626 --> 30:06.456
So we agree, the timing,
probably not a coincidence.

30:06.500 --> 30:07.980
So what's troubling?

30:08.023 --> 30:09.242
Well, after hearing
what she said,

30:09.285 --> 30:10.939
we don't think Virgil's
the one who sold it.

30:10.983 --> 30:12.723
We've been through his life.

30:12.767 --> 30:14.464
He wasn't a traveler.
He didn't have foreign friends.

30:14.508 --> 30:17.206
Mostly, he stuck to
the people he grew up with.

30:17.250 --> 30:19.861
He didn't strike us as the type
who was rubbing elbows

30:19.905 --> 30:22.168
with high-level
Ethiopian businessmen.

30:22.211 --> 30:23.996
You're right,
he probably wasn't.

30:24.039 --> 30:25.432
So why don't you seem troubled?

30:25.475 --> 30:26.955
Because I can't help
remembering,

30:26.999 --> 30:28.652
you've already met someone

30:28.696 --> 30:30.219
connected to Virgil's
place of work,

30:30.263 --> 30:32.265
with access to
the Swensons' collection,

30:32.308 --> 30:34.702
and the proper contacts
in Ethiopia.

30:36.791 --> 30:38.880
You think I killed Virgil Gwinn?

30:38.924 --> 30:40.926
I told you,
I barely knew him.

30:40.969 --> 30:43.450
You did, but we're
guessing you said that

30:43.493 --> 30:45.887
because you realized that
we might see the two of you

30:45.931 --> 30:47.715
on Krypsona's
surveillance video.

30:47.758 --> 30:50.109
Now, we looked at the
footage pretty closely.

30:50.152 --> 30:52.241
We couldn't make out
what you were saying,

30:52.285 --> 30:53.852
but that's mostly because
you and Virgil

30:53.895 --> 30:56.855
would go into Ms. Swenson's unit
whenever you talked,

30:56.898 --> 30:59.248
presumably because there
were no cameras in there.

30:59.292 --> 31:00.902
You're imagining things.

31:00.946 --> 31:02.338
BELL:
Are we?

31:02.382 --> 31:05.559
'Cause if so, our imaginations
are pretty thorough.

31:05.602 --> 31:07.430
Here's how we figure
it went down.

31:07.474 --> 31:09.606
You discovered the
archaeologist's journal

31:09.650 --> 31:11.304
while you were working
on the Swensons' collection,

31:11.347 --> 31:15.003
you saw the info about oil, and
decided to sell it to Ethiopia.

31:15.047 --> 31:16.962
You mentioned you
lived there. We checked,

31:17.005 --> 31:18.833
and some of the work
you did was directly

31:18.877 --> 31:20.835
for the Ethiopian government,
so you would've known

31:20.879 --> 31:22.663
the right people to get
the information to.

31:22.706 --> 31:24.404
Then along comes
Virgil Gwinn.

31:24.447 --> 31:27.886
Thanks to Krypsona's cameras,
he had eyes on everything there.

31:27.929 --> 31:30.018
He must have caught you
sneaking that journal out

31:30.062 --> 31:32.629
and back in, had at least
a sense of what you were doing,

31:32.673 --> 31:34.805
and demanded a cut.

31:34.849 --> 31:36.590
But you weren't down
for being blackmailed.

31:36.633 --> 31:39.071
So you arranged
to meet him at Krypsona.

31:39.114 --> 31:40.942
You made sure he disabled
the cameras

31:40.986 --> 31:43.162
and erased any proof
of what you'd done,

31:43.205 --> 31:44.685
and then you killed him.

31:47.470 --> 31:49.995
I already told you,
I quit working

31:50.038 --> 31:51.866
for Aura Swenson weeks ago.

31:51.910 --> 31:53.955
I didn't even have access
to the building anymore.

31:53.999 --> 31:55.565
Virgil could have let you in.

31:55.609 --> 31:57.567
Or you could have used
your own key card.

31:57.611 --> 32:00.048
According to Krypsona's records,
you never turned it in.

32:02.703 --> 32:04.096
I guess I threw it out.

32:07.142 --> 32:08.927
Look...

32:08.970 --> 32:10.929
now that you have
laid it all out,

32:10.972 --> 32:13.453
I guess I understand
why you suspect me.

32:13.496 --> 32:17.979
But you're suggesting
I would sabotage a peace deal

32:18.023 --> 32:20.025
for personal profit?

32:21.287 --> 32:24.072
Tens of thousands of
people have already died

32:24.116 --> 32:26.292
in the fighting between
Ethiopia and Eritrea.

32:26.335 --> 32:30.122
What you are accusing
me of is inhuman.

32:32.298 --> 32:35.997
Virgil was killed three
nights ago, right?

32:36.041 --> 32:37.999
Tuesday?
That's right.

32:38.043 --> 32:40.001
I was at the Amore Opera
with some friends.

32:40.045 --> 32:42.003
La Traviata.

32:42.047 --> 32:45.006
We even went out
for drinks afterward.

32:45.050 --> 32:48.227
I'm sure you'll want
their names.

32:52.013 --> 32:55.147
Marcus called.
Florenti's alibi checked out.

32:55.190 --> 32:56.975
Plus, we can't find
any connection between

32:57.018 --> 32:59.107
him and the
business associate

32:59.151 --> 33:01.109
who supplied the journal,
or any communication

33:01.153 --> 33:03.285
between Florenti
and his contacts in Ethiopia.

33:03.329 --> 33:05.766
As far as we can tell,
he hasn't even set foot

33:05.809 --> 33:07.202
in an Ethiopian restaurant.

33:07.246 --> 33:09.204
You and Marcus
looked him in the eye.

33:09.248 --> 33:10.727
Are you convinced
of his guilt?

33:10.771 --> 33:12.381
Honestly,
when he gave us his alibi,

33:12.425 --> 33:14.035
it felt like he was taunting us.

33:14.079 --> 33:16.081
Well, his alibi certainly
doesn't clear him.

33:16.124 --> 33:17.604
His Ethiopian contacts

33:17.647 --> 33:19.127
could have sent someone
to kill Gwinn.

33:19.171 --> 33:20.824
Mm, a hit man.

33:20.868 --> 33:23.131
So, I reached out to some
friends at the State Department

33:23.175 --> 33:24.915
and at Interpol,
requesting the names

33:24.959 --> 33:28.006
of any international "fixers"
with ties to Ethiopia.

33:28.049 --> 33:30.312
I've also written to my father.

33:30.356 --> 33:32.053
He's the head of a
global crime syndicate,

33:32.097 --> 33:33.663
so he might have
some insights.

33:33.707 --> 33:36.057
I'm just awaiting responses.

33:36.101 --> 33:37.450
Speaking of your father,

33:37.493 --> 33:40.235
have you heard from his pal,
the assistant director?

33:40.279 --> 33:42.063
I spoke to him yesterday.

33:42.107 --> 33:45.327
He assures me that my
exculpation is imminent.

33:46.589 --> 33:48.678
So, it occurs to me

33:48.722 --> 33:51.638
that you and I should
talk about the future.

33:51.681 --> 33:55.685
Specifically, our plans
beyond the resolution

33:55.729 --> 33:57.252
of the Patrick Meers case.

33:57.296 --> 33:59.950
Well, I just assumed
we'd return to London.

33:59.994 --> 34:04.912
Yeah, we might,
but we wouldn't have to.

34:04.955 --> 34:07.045
I mean, we could,

34:07.088 --> 34:12.354
if we so choose,
resume our work at the 11th.

34:12.398 --> 34:15.531
You said that staying in London
was important to you.

34:15.575 --> 34:17.968
Yeah, it was, but I'd
be lying if I said

34:18.012 --> 34:21.320
that being here didn't
stir up certain feelings.

34:21.363 --> 34:26.586
Anyway, when my name is cleared,
I can travel as I please.

34:26.629 --> 34:29.371
Our consultancy
could become bicontinental.

34:29.415 --> 34:33.201
You mean work with the NYPD
and Scotland Yard?

34:33.245 --> 34:35.073
We have the means.

34:38.902 --> 34:40.861
Okay.

34:40.904 --> 34:42.602
Thanks.

34:42.645 --> 34:44.386
Oh, I'm just being selfish.

34:44.430 --> 34:46.823
I want it all.

34:48.260 --> 34:50.653
Always do.

34:54.266 --> 34:56.050
I'll see you in the morning.

35:10.369 --> 35:14.329
Ugh. What is that?

35:14.373 --> 35:16.592
Eritrean national anthem.

35:16.636 --> 35:18.333
It's quite rousing,
isn't it?

35:18.377 --> 35:21.031
Oh, obviously it was to me.

35:21.075 --> 35:24.557
Heard back from my father.

35:24.600 --> 35:27.168
Well, I take it
he had some thoughts

35:27.212 --> 35:30.215
on the hit man from Ethiopia.

35:30.258 --> 35:32.173
He had a good deal more
to offer than that.

35:32.217 --> 35:35.307
He proposed an entirely
different theory of the crime.

35:35.350 --> 35:38.614
A theory so depraved,
it took him to think of it.

35:38.658 --> 35:41.269
I'm listening.

35:41.313 --> 35:44.316
Ethiopia is not
the only nation to benefit

35:44.359 --> 35:45.752
from learning about the oil.

35:48.972 --> 35:51.323
Eritrea?

35:51.366 --> 35:53.977
Okay, explain that.
If Ethiopia holds onto the land,

35:54.021 --> 35:55.196
they get the oil.

35:55.240 --> 35:57.720
Wouldn't Eritrea be
the losers in all this?

35:57.764 --> 36:01.159
Its citizens, perhaps,
but not its leaders.

36:01.202 --> 36:04.031
Since declaring independence
25 years ago,

36:04.074 --> 36:07.339
Eritrea has suffered
under a single despotic regime

36:07.382 --> 36:09.689
accused of numerous
human rights violations.

36:09.732 --> 36:13.171
The government has repeatedly
postponed national elections,

36:13.214 --> 36:16.435
using the perpetual war
with Ethiopia as an excuse.

36:16.478 --> 36:18.219
So, they need to keep
the war going

36:18.263 --> 36:19.829
in order to stay in power.

36:19.873 --> 36:23.616
Should they be so unlucky
as for peace to break out,

36:23.659 --> 36:26.314
the regime's ouster
would be all but guaranteed.

36:26.358 --> 36:29.665
So, you think the reason why
we haven't been able

36:29.709 --> 36:32.973
to find the hit man
the Ethiopian government hired

36:33.016 --> 36:35.454
is because Florenti
didn't sell the information

36:35.497 --> 36:39.240
to Ethiopia;
he sold it to Eritrea.

36:39.284 --> 36:41.721
From there,
it was a simple matter

36:41.764 --> 36:43.505
of identifying
the global security firm

36:43.549 --> 36:45.290
the Eritrean government
employed.

36:45.333 --> 36:48.118
And that led me to the name
of a hired assassin,

36:48.162 --> 36:50.382
who was in New York
at the time of the murder.

36:51.470 --> 36:53.341
So now what do we do?

36:53.385 --> 36:55.256
You do nothing.

36:55.300 --> 36:57.606
I've already made arrangements
for Mr. Florenti's undoing.

37:10.619 --> 37:13.231
FLORENTI:
Hello.

37:13.274 --> 37:16.059
Mr. Florenti, please come in.

37:16.103 --> 37:19.019
I'm looking for Mr. al-Maliki?

37:20.629 --> 37:24.807
He asked me to inspect
some Iraqi artifacts.

37:24.851 --> 37:27.680
It is a beautiful city,
isn't it?

37:30.291 --> 37:32.641
It's home.

37:32.685 --> 37:34.295
Yeah.

37:34.339 --> 37:36.123
Sorry about the deception.

37:36.166 --> 37:38.343
There is no Mr. Maliki.
I'm the one who called.

37:38.386 --> 37:41.563
I work with the police.

37:43.217 --> 37:45.306
You people still think
I killed Virgil Gwinn?

37:45.350 --> 37:48.440
As a matter of fact, I'm
quite sure that you didn't.

37:48.483 --> 37:50.268
Really?
Yeah.

37:50.311 --> 37:52.182
This man did.

37:52.226 --> 37:54.533
His name is Gavin Lund.

37:54.576 --> 37:57.579
The Eritrean government
hired him to kill Gwinn

37:57.623 --> 38:01.104
after you told them
Gwinn was a threat.Here we go.

38:01.148 --> 38:03.237
Gwinn knew about the journal
entry you had discovered,

38:03.281 --> 38:05.021
which meant he could
expose their plan

38:05.065 --> 38:07.110
to perpetuate war
with Ethiopia.

38:07.154 --> 38:09.330
I was quite sure
you'd recognize Lund

38:09.374 --> 38:11.767
if you had given him
your key card in person.

38:11.811 --> 38:15.162
That's how he gained access
to Krypsona, is it not?

38:15.205 --> 38:19.558
Once and for all, no,
I do not recognize this man.

38:19.601 --> 38:22.212
And I don't have any idea
what you could poss...

38:23.910 --> 38:25.955
What the hell was that?Those are bullets.

38:27.174 --> 38:29.132
Mr. Lund just tried
to kill you.

38:29.176 --> 38:30.525
What?

38:31.918 --> 38:34.573
Yeah, he's perched on
that balcony over there.

38:37.402 --> 38:40.535
I made sure that he knew
about our meeting

38:40.579 --> 38:42.363
and that you intended
to give a full confession.

38:42.407 --> 38:44.452
Are you insane?

38:44.496 --> 38:47.499
You should know, my father
owns this apartment.

38:47.542 --> 38:49.239
Those windows are
bulletproof.

38:49.283 --> 38:51.154
Well, bullet-resistant.

38:51.198 --> 38:53.374
It's hard to tell how many
rounds they will withstand

38:53.418 --> 38:55.333
before they start
getting through.

38:57.073 --> 38:58.466
So, what are your options?

38:58.510 --> 39:00.381
You could get outside
and make a run for it.

39:00.425 --> 39:02.383
Oh, I don't think that's wise.
He's got a clear line of sight

39:02.427 --> 39:04.820
from that balcony to the
building's entrance.

39:04.864 --> 39:07.649
You could stay
inside, wait it out.

39:07.693 --> 39:09.303
But I don't think
that's going to work, either,

39:09.347 --> 39:10.173
'cause he's a pro.

39:13.089 --> 39:14.700
I also gave him
every detail of your life,

39:14.743 --> 39:17.311
so, eventually,
he's gonna find you.What?!

39:17.355 --> 39:19.487
Fortunately,
I have a way to guarantee

39:19.531 --> 39:21.663
safe passage to the police,

39:21.707 --> 39:25.319
where, if you agree, you'll
give a full confession.

39:34.328 --> 39:37.026
Fine. Fine.
I'll do whatever you say.

39:37.070 --> 39:39.464
Just-just get me out of here.

39:45.557 --> 39:47.036
I see you're still alive,

39:47.080 --> 39:48.516
so I take it
everything worked out.

39:48.560 --> 39:50.344
Yes. Sebastian Florenti
is at the precinct confessing.

39:50.388 --> 39:53.826
He confirmed my deduction
as to the hit man's identity.

39:53.869 --> 39:55.131
He and Gavin Lund did meet.

39:55.175 --> 39:56.263
But Florenti
didn't suspect

39:56.306 --> 39:58.657
that the shooter was
just your friend?

39:58.700 --> 40:01.486
No. Lund is presently
in Hamburg.

40:01.529 --> 40:04.227
Interpol has issued a notice
to have him picked up.

40:04.271 --> 40:05.925
So, I've been e-mailing
with Kitty,

40:05.968 --> 40:07.535
and since it looks like
we're gonna be here a while,

40:07.579 --> 40:10.277
I asked her to send
some things for me.

40:10.320 --> 40:11.931
Do you want anything
from your place?

40:18.416 --> 40:20.461
Is everything okay?

40:20.505 --> 40:22.420
No.

40:35.389 --> 40:38.131
HOLMES:
Hey.

40:38.174 --> 40:39.524
I told you to make
things right.

40:39.567 --> 40:41.395
Oh, I see you got my text.

40:41.439 --> 40:43.397
According to this,
a convicted killer

40:43.441 --> 40:45.181
named Santos Oliva
left a letter

40:45.225 --> 40:46.574
confessing to
Michael Rowan's murder,

40:46.618 --> 40:48.576
and then he hanged
himself in his cell.

40:48.620 --> 40:50.317
Yeah, Oliva fit the bill.

40:50.360 --> 40:52.754
He was in the right area
the night Rowan died,

40:52.798 --> 40:55.322
and he had the right sheet;
he'd killed before.

40:55.365 --> 40:57.672
He didn't kill Michael Rowan.Are you sure about that?

40:57.716 --> 41:00.327
I thought all you knew was that
it wasn't you and Miss Watson.

41:00.370 --> 41:02.503
Are you saying
you know more?

41:02.547 --> 41:04.374
This is not what we discussed.

41:04.418 --> 41:06.246
What did you think
was gonna happen?

41:06.289 --> 41:08.204
Clearing your name
was one thing,

41:08.248 --> 41:09.641
but both of you, no.

41:09.684 --> 41:11.860
I had to put
the blame someplace.

41:13.514 --> 41:15.995
Oh, and by the way,
Oliva wasn't the only one

41:16.038 --> 41:17.300
who wrote a confession.

41:17.344 --> 41:19.041
I've written one as well.

41:19.085 --> 41:23.219
In it, I admit I took a bribe
from Morland Holmes.

41:23.263 --> 41:26.222
A fact others can easily verify,
as you pointed out.

41:26.266 --> 41:30.400
Only, according to my letter,
that bribe was in exchange

41:30.444 --> 41:33.316
for clearing Michael Rowan's
real killer...

41:33.360 --> 41:34.622
Joan Watson.

41:36.450 --> 41:40.541
Now, you contact me again

41:40.585 --> 41:43.457
or tell anyone what you know,

41:43.501 --> 41:46.852
my letter goes public.

41:51.770 --> 41:54.381
Oh, almost forgot.

41:54.424 --> 41:56.209
Welcome home.
