WEBVTT

00:01.102 --> 00:02.856
All right, let's hit the bar, guys.

00:02.857 --> 00:05.111
If we've timed this right,
the girls will already be tipsy

00:05.112 --> 00:06.795
and we will not have to buy them drinks.

00:08.431 --> 00:10.775
Yeah, well, you guys have fun...

00:10.776 --> 00:12.607
And don't worry about little old me.

00:13.300 --> 00:15.217
Just another Saturday night alone...

00:15.745 --> 00:16.883
With a baby...

00:17.333 --> 00:18.701
That isn't mine.

00:19.791 --> 00:22.012
Well, maybe if you hadn't
cheated on your boyfriend Brad

00:22.013 --> 00:24.812
by hitting on his dad you'd still
have a date on Saturday night.

00:25.253 --> 00:28.557
And Brad would have a slightly
less awkward Thanksgiving.

00:29.317 --> 00:30.743
Yeah, Mrs. Wheeler,

00:30.744 --> 00:32.656
you're like a bad country song.

00:34.390 --> 00:36.631
♪ There was a cowboy who loved her ♪

00:36.632 --> 00:38.412
♪ But she had eyes for the father ♪

00:38.413 --> 00:40.237
♪ Now her heart needs a healer ♪

00:40.238 --> 00:42.262
♪ 'Cause she's a lonely Mrs. Wheeler. ♪

00:45.121 --> 00:47.319
Contrary to popular opinion,

00:47.320 --> 00:49.226
I don't regret breaking
up with Brad at all.

00:49.227 --> 00:52.253
- Didn't he dump you?
- I don't regret getting dumped by Brad at all.

00:53.115 --> 00:54.913
I am so over him.

00:55.251 --> 00:58.070
I'm actually fine if I
never see his face again.

00:58.775 --> 01:00.305
Oh my God, there he is!

01:00.306 --> 01:01.831
Oh! Turn it up, turn it up.

01:02.978 --> 01:04.699
Of all the apartments

01:04.700 --> 01:07.574
in all the towns in all the world,

01:07.575 --> 01:10.014
you should walk into mine.

01:10.530 --> 01:12.849
Oh, hey, Brad "the pad."

01:14.219 --> 01:15.932
I think this is the beginning

01:15.933 --> 01:18.654
of a beautiful realtorship.

01:19.366 --> 01:22.430
Here's renting from me, kids.

01:24.197 --> 01:26.740
Oh! That's the commercial I helped Brad

01:26.741 --> 01:28.933
write and direct before we broke up.

01:30.820 --> 01:32.220
Isn't it great?

01:33.344 --> 01:35.829
- You know what? I think
- I hear our cab, yeah.

01:36.341 --> 01:39.158
<i>- Don't wait up.
- That was really bad.</i>

01:40.883 --> 01:42.311
Oh my God, Emma.

01:43.656 --> 01:45.342
I want Brad back.

01:46.946 --> 01:49.033
Oh my God.

01:50.067 --> 01:51.390
I know.

02:04.559 --> 02:06.624
Why does Ben always give you the free food

02:06.625 --> 02:08.757
but I just get the food
that been sent back?

02:10.056 --> 02:13.306
I'm his mother. I fed him for 20 years.

02:13.307 --> 02:16.368
At least his breasts will be where they're
supposed to be when I'm done eating.

02:17.417 --> 02:18.813
Oh my God, it's him.

02:25.228 --> 02:26.524
Are you having a seizure?

02:26.525 --> 02:28.124
No, Brad's here.

02:28.125 --> 02:29.333
All right, pretend that I'm hilarious

02:29.334 --> 02:30.926
and that you are having the best time ever.

02:34.045 --> 02:35.814
I thought you just said you were over him.

02:35.815 --> 02:38.811
Yeah, well, I might've changed my mind.

02:38.812 --> 02:41.707
But how do I get a guy
that doesn't want me?

02:41.708 --> 02:43.461
I've never met one of those.

02:43.462 --> 02:44.915
I mean, hello.

02:45.956 --> 02:48.076
Guys only want one thing...

02:48.077 --> 02:51.086
What we can't have. You
just have to ignore him.

02:51.087 --> 02:52.614
- Ignore him?
- Yeah.

02:52.615 --> 02:53.707
I can do that.

02:54.417 --> 02:55.759
- Brad. Hey.
- Hey.

02:55.760 --> 02:58.359
Long time. Hey, you know
my mom's here, right?

02:58.360 --> 03:00.433
Yeah, I was kinda hoping
that I might run into her.

03:00.434 --> 03:03.104
I thought maybe I could talk her
into getting back together again

03:03.105 --> 03:06.523
- you think there's any chance?
- How do I put this delicately?

03:06.936 --> 03:08.640
Not a shot in hell.

03:09.196 --> 03:10.926
Oh. Umm, are you sure?

03:10.927 --> 03:12.639
Oh. Hey, Bonnie.

03:12.640 --> 03:15.981
Oh, hi... Brad.

03:16.827 --> 03:18.296
I love you, Benji.

03:20.975 --> 03:22.880
And now I'm sure.

03:23.735 --> 03:24.789
Whoa.

03:25.168 --> 03:28.000
No one's ever not wanted me before.

03:28.001 --> 03:29.745
I me, hello.

03:30.830 --> 03:33.031
I'm gonna let you in on
a little secret, Bradley:

03:33.032 --> 03:35.111
Women really only want one thing...

03:35.112 --> 03:37.583
What they can't have. You
gotta make her jealous.

03:37.584 --> 03:40.174
- How am I supposed to do that?
- Oh, easy. Just set up a fake date

03:40.175 --> 03:41.590
with one of your ex-girlfriends.

03:41.591 --> 03:43.719
And if you don't have any,
you can borrow one of mine.

03:43.720 --> 03:45.560
Girls break up with me all the time.

03:47.386 --> 03:50.077
So, how are things going with aunt Margot?

03:50.078 --> 03:53.288
- Are we calling her "mom" yet?
- Oh my God, awesome, super,

03:53.289 --> 03:55.994
great, totally amazing.
Love her, seriously.

03:56.975 --> 03:59.379
Which means "terrible, awful.

03:59.380 --> 04:01.101
I can't stand cleaning up after her

04:01.102 --> 04:04.751
- and I can't wait for her to leave."
- I know, I know.

04:04.752 --> 04:06.470
It's just... you know I don't have

04:06.471 --> 04:07.968
the best relationship with my mom,

04:07.969 --> 04:10.574
and then here with Margot, there
was a chance for a fresh start.

04:10.893 --> 04:13.032
You know, I thought she
could be my dream mom,

04:13.033 --> 04:15.653
the kind who shared clothes and secrets

04:15.654 --> 04:17.702
and gave great boyfriend advice.

04:18.129 --> 04:19.987
And Margot doesn't do any of that?

04:19.988 --> 04:21.843
Let's just say I'm lucky I still have

04:21.844 --> 04:23.717
a boyfriend after what
happened the other night.

04:26.879 --> 04:29.068
Psst! Riley!

04:29.069 --> 04:32.013
Oh good, you're up.

04:33.285 --> 04:35.405
- Oh my God.
- Hi, Philip.

04:36.166 --> 04:37.415
I'm Margot.

04:38.693 --> 04:41.000
Oh my God, how awkward would this be

04:41.001 --> 04:43.838
if this wasn't Philip? It is, right?

04:44.148 --> 04:45.915
Yeah, it is.

04:46.882 --> 04:49.459
So Philip's been sleeping
over a lot lately, huh?

04:50.179 --> 04:51.964
That's what you got from that story?

04:52.443 --> 04:54.058
Maybe you should just
give her another chance.

04:54.494 --> 04:56.401
Or maybe you should let me talk to her.

04:56.402 --> 04:59.892
Oh my God, no. Danny, that would
just be way too embarrassing.

05:00.225 --> 05:02.722
<i>- Promise me you will not say anything.</i>

05:03.621 --> 05:05.484
Oh! Hey, guys.

05:05.485 --> 05:07.016
I was worried about waking you.

05:07.510 --> 05:09.193
<i>It's the middle of the day.</i>

05:09.194 --> 05:12.589
Is it? Wow. I just lost all track of time.

05:12.590 --> 05:15.058
I was at a protest until 4:00 A.M.

05:15.059 --> 05:17.977
That's when we realized we were
just in line for concert tickets.

05:19.621 --> 05:21.332
Oh good. Well, that only leaves,

05:21.333 --> 05:23.176
oh, 12 hours unaccounted for,

05:23.177 --> 05:25.026
and, oh, God forbid you should call.

05:25.027 --> 05:27.612
Oh my God, once again, I sound like my mom.

05:29.796 --> 05:32.152
So, Margot,

05:32.153 --> 05:33.392
I think we need to have a little chat.

05:39.012 --> 05:40.940
Are you sure Bonnie's coming?

05:40.941 --> 05:42.424
Oh, she's definitely coming.

05:42.425 --> 05:44.363
It's almost time for her 6:00 feeding.

05:45.158 --> 05:46.935
Nice job with the fake date.

05:48.158 --> 05:51.420
Veronica. We go way back.

05:51.421 --> 05:53.758
Well, let me know when you're
done using her as a decoy.

05:53.759 --> 05:56.306
I wanna use her as a me-coy.

05:56.307 --> 05:58.014
That means I wanna have sex with her.

05:59.089 --> 06:01.562
- Oh, here's my mom. Go go go.
- Okay, there he is.

06:01.563 --> 06:04.435
Ignore him and he's all yours.

06:04.436 --> 06:06.304
Okay okay. Really?

06:06.305 --> 06:09.558
Because right now it
looks like he's all hers.

06:09.559 --> 06:11.934
Hey, mom. Hey, Brad's here.

06:11.935 --> 06:14.143
And I think he might've found
himself a new lady friend.

06:14.144 --> 06:16.824
But good for him, right,
since you're not interested.

06:16.825 --> 06:19.185
- Yeah.
-  Look, just be cool.

06:19.186 --> 06:21.031
<i>I mean you've got him
right where you want him.</i>

06:23.232 --> 06:25.406
If I had him where I want him,

06:25.407 --> 06:27.521
his lips would be on my face!

06:27.522 --> 06:28.952
Okay, you know what? Never mind.

06:29.384 --> 06:31.300
You know what? I got this.

06:32.491 --> 06:35.306
Oh... Sergio.

06:35.868 --> 06:38.079
There you are, you scamp.

06:38.513 --> 06:41.018
So should we order lunch

06:41.019 --> 06:42.995
or just go straight to dessert?

06:44.145 --> 06:46.030
Pretend you like me.

06:49.252 --> 06:50.993
Oh. Oh.

06:51.486 --> 06:53.188
Oh darling. Da...

06:56.194 --> 06:58.076
You're together, aren't you?

07:07.036 --> 07:09.910
Oh Sergio, how could you?!

07:11.576 --> 07:13.396
Let's run, let's run, let's run.

07:20.584 --> 07:22.792
And here I am on the Rolling Stones tour.

07:22.793 --> 07:25.706
- Oh my God.
- I was their official photographer.

07:25.707 --> 07:27.479
- That's Mick...
- Jagger?

07:27.480 --> 07:29.606
Debowski, the tour bus driver.

07:30.558 --> 07:32.336
He was a rock star in his own way,

07:32.337 --> 07:33.988
if you know what I mean.

07:36.438 --> 07:39.706
Oh hey, just on my way home from practice,

07:39.707 --> 07:41.338
wanted to come by and say hi,

07:41.339 --> 07:43.080
because we haven't communicated

07:43.081 --> 07:45.709
since I said good-bye earlier today.

07:46.453 --> 07:50.095
Very very true, because we have not spoken.

07:51.675 --> 07:54.605
But I do need to call my psychic.

07:54.606 --> 07:56.280
I'm running late for a session,

07:56.281 --> 07:57.980
but I'm hoping she'll know that.

08:01.628 --> 08:03.896
God, oh my God. It's
like she just flipped on

08:03.897 --> 08:06.292
some kind of mom switch. Thank you so much

08:06.293 --> 08:08.339
for talking me into
giving her another chance.

08:08.340 --> 08:12.403
She's perfect. Look, she braided my hair.

08:13.812 --> 08:16.312
She's been giving me advice about my life,

08:16.313 --> 08:18.641
and my career, about Philip.

08:18.642 --> 08:20.044
Oh, did she tell you to slow it down?

08:20.045 --> 08:21.738
Because you should totally listen to her.

08:22.379 --> 08:23.971
No. Umm...

08:23.972 --> 08:25.934
She thinks he should move in with me.

08:25.935 --> 08:27.701
<i>- Move in with you?</i>

08:27.702 --> 08:31.557
- Isn't that great?
- Yes! Absolutely,

08:31.558 --> 08:34.037
positivo. Couldn't be happier.

08:34.038 --> 08:35.576
Yeah, amazing.

08:38.246 --> 08:41.006
- Ignore him?!
- I said ignore him,

08:41.006 --> 08:43.453
<i>- not reenact a telenovela.</i>

08:44.780 --> 08:46.718
Hey hey hey hey, what's going on?

08:46.719 --> 08:48.708
Tucker just destroyed any chance

08:48.709 --> 08:52.115
that I might have had of
getting back together with Brad!

08:52.116 --> 08:54.481
Wait wait wait, you like Brad?
I thought you were over him.

08:54.482 --> 08:56.184
I was. I'm not. Keep up.

08:57.148 --> 09:00.064
But now he has moved
on to some other bimbo.

09:01.157 --> 09:02.819
That wasn't just any bimbo!

09:02.820 --> 09:05.080
That's the bimbo I told him to
go out with to make you jealous!

09:05.081 --> 09:06.307
Wait, why would he want
to make her jealous?

09:06.308 --> 09:07.558
- Because he likes her!
- He does?

09:07.559 --> 09:08.808
He does?!

09:09.506 --> 09:11.155
Yes, and you totally ignored him!

09:11.156 --> 09:13.604
Yeah, because Tuckledoodle Dumb told me to!

09:14.451 --> 09:16.953
Well, what does it matter?
You both like each other!

09:16.954 --> 09:18.979
- Oh my God, you're right!
- I know!

09:18.980 --> 09:20.290
Oh my... all right, you know,

09:20.291 --> 09:21.871
I have to call him. I have to call him.

09:21.872 --> 09:24.652
Oh, I can't believe Brad and
I are getting back together!

09:25.851 --> 09:28.608
Oh hey, I just ran into Brad. Guess what?

09:28.609 --> 09:30.038
Oh, honey, we are way ahead of you.

09:30.039 --> 09:32.639
He is still in love with
me and he wants me back.

09:32.640 --> 09:35.084
Close. He's engaged!

09:36.994 --> 09:40.128
♪ There was a cowboy
who loved her, but... ♪

09:44.196 --> 09:45.425
Engaged?

09:45.793 --> 09:48.755
How could Brad get engaged without me?!

09:50.181 --> 09:51.784
But that's not even the big news.

09:51.785 --> 09:54.835
That stupid margot told Riley that
she should move in with Philip.

09:54.836 --> 09:56.918
I don't care if she told her to eat Philip!

09:57.879 --> 09:59.684
What did Brad say?

09:59.685 --> 10:02.712
It's his ex, the girl
he dated just before you.

10:02.713 --> 10:04.205
I guess they were pretty serious.

10:04.646 --> 10:06.103
This is your fault.

10:07.201 --> 10:08.032
- My fault?
- Mm-hmm.

10:08.033 --> 10:10.024
- What happened to it being Tucker's fault?
- My fault?

10:10.025 --> 10:11.436
You're the one who didn't
admit you liked him.

10:11.437 --> 10:12.720
- It's your fault!
- Okay, you know what?

10:12.721 --> 10:14.560
Don't try to make this my fault!

10:14.561 --> 10:16.363
Okay, here's what you two are gonna do.

10:16.364 --> 10:19.346
You two are gonna break
up this little engagement.

10:19.347 --> 10:21.758
Wh... why would you want to
stop two people who are in love?

10:21.759 --> 10:24.508
Because I'm currently not
one of those two people!

10:28.223 --> 10:29.802
Om...

10:32.071 --> 10:33.668
Hi, are we alone?

10:34.458 --> 10:35.849
<i>No.</i>

10:40.030 --> 10:41.313
Now we are.

10:43.214 --> 10:45.439
Okay, I have to talk to you about Riley.

10:45.440 --> 10:48.570
And I have to thank you for your advice.

10:48.571 --> 10:52.202
Turns out this mom stuff is super easy.

10:53.038 --> 10:55.671
I just kept saying,
"yeah, that sounds cool."

10:55.672 --> 10:57.828
And now she thinks I'm the perfect mom.

10:59.289 --> 11:00.823
"Yeah, that sounds cool"?

11:00.824 --> 11:03.334
That's what you said when she
asked if Philip should move in?

11:03.335 --> 11:06.018
Oh, is that what she was asking me?

11:06.853 --> 11:08.859
I might've zoned out for a second there.

11:09.727 --> 11:11.413
<i>- But he can't move in! He's...</i>

11:11.414 --> 11:12.999
coming out of the bathroom half-naked.

11:13.000 --> 11:14.735
<i>- Hey, Phil!</i>

11:14.736 --> 11:16.646
Danny, hi. Great to see you.

11:16.647 --> 11:18.584
So, have you heard the good news?

11:18.585 --> 11:20.485
Looks like I might be moving in.

11:20.486 --> 11:21.965
He doesn't think it's good news.

11:21.966 --> 11:24.421
Oh! Because I think it's awesome news.

11:24.422 --> 11:25.918
But you just said he shouldn't live...

11:25.919 --> 11:27.670
So far away from his girlfriend!

11:28.007 --> 11:30.912
Jeez, Margot, I think we know
what you smoked for breakfast.

11:32.695 --> 11:34.018
If you could put in a good word for me,

11:34.019 --> 11:35.775
- that would be brilliant.
- No problem.

11:35.776 --> 11:37.389
I can totally do that.

11:37.743 --> 11:40.140
There's no way I'm doing that.
You have to get rid of him.

11:41.335 --> 11:44.331
Okay, while I am neither
confirming or denying

11:44.332 --> 11:46.488
what I actually had for breakfast,

11:47.032 --> 11:48.808
you are making no sense.

11:49.131 --> 11:51.354
You need to tell Riley that
she's moving too fast...

11:52.002 --> 11:54.212
Or that there's a difference

11:54.213 --> 11:56.353
between settling down and settling.

11:56.851 --> 11:58.729
Oh, I like that one.

12:00.049 --> 12:01.954
I should be a mom! Yeah.

12:03.451 --> 12:06.043
What's wrong with you? You missed
the whole point of the plan.

12:06.044 --> 12:07.911
Guys, there is no plan.

12:07.912 --> 12:10.881
I finally realized that
Veronica is the one for me.

12:10.882 --> 12:12.626
And Ben, I have you to thank for it.

12:12.627 --> 12:15.160
Dude, don't you get it? My
mom still has feelings for you.

12:15.584 --> 12:18.914
- But what about Sergio?
- There is no Sergio.

12:19.855 --> 12:22.225
Look, what Bonnie and I had was amazing.

12:22.226 --> 12:25.437
Even cosmic, dare I say mind-blowing?

12:25.438 --> 12:27.380
I dare you not to.

12:27.381 --> 12:29.553
But Bonnie's all drama and danger,

12:29.554 --> 12:30.801
which I'm done with.

12:31.414 --> 12:34.535
But you're saying you still
have feelings for Mrs. Wheeler.

12:34.536 --> 12:37.570
I always will, but Veronica
and I are meant to be together.

12:37.571 --> 12:39.581
I know this now. I've made up my mind.

12:40.142 --> 12:44.471
But now we have to have a
slightly awkward conversation.

12:44.472 --> 12:47.378
More awkward than us trying to
convince you to sleep with my mom?

12:48.025 --> 12:50.844
I talked to your bar manager and
I'm gonna have a little party here

12:50.845 --> 12:53.607
to announce the engagement,
if that's okay with you.

12:53.608 --> 12:55.855
Veronica really wants
to move this thing along.

12:55.856 --> 12:58.424
Well, maybe she knows if you can
change your mind that quickly,

12:58.425 --> 13:01.921
- it wasn't meant to be.
- So you're gonna be here tonight?

13:01.922 --> 13:05.025
Yes. Yes, I am. I literally just said that.

13:05.940 --> 13:07.290
Okay. All right.

13:07.291 --> 13:09.054
Well, I have to go nowhere

13:09.525 --> 13:11.092
to talk to no one,

13:11.591 --> 13:13.988
about absolutely nothing related

13:13.989 --> 13:16.271
to this conversation whatsoever.

13:16.711 --> 13:18.730
Nobody follow me.

13:21.260 --> 13:23.936
She's done a complete 180 on
the whole Philip-moving-in thing.

13:23.937 --> 13:26.430
It's now the worst idea she's ever heard.

13:26.431 --> 13:29.106
Gosh, and I was really
pulling for you lovebirds.

13:29.107 --> 13:32.352
- Shucks!
- Hey, guys, look, if you're comfortable,

13:32.353 --> 13:34.537
I'd love for you to come to
my engagement party tonight.

13:35.138 --> 13:36.736
You know, it's none of my business,

13:36.737 --> 13:38.781
but don't you think you're
moving a little fast?

13:38.782 --> 13:42.100
I mean, there's a big difference
between settling down and settling.

13:43.991 --> 13:45.318
Huh. That's weird.

13:45.319 --> 13:48.321
That's almost word for word what
Margot just said to me about Philip.

13:49.058 --> 13:52.032
Well, you know, we both are great thinkers.

13:52.353 --> 13:53.630
Oh my God, Danny!

13:54.084 --> 13:56.986
I told you not to say anything!
I told you to stay out of this!

13:56.987 --> 13:58.810
You're my best friend.
I'm just trying to help.

13:58.811 --> 14:01.290
Well, then act like one
and be supportive! You know?

14:01.291 --> 14:04.143
At least now I know you're the one
who doesn't want me living with Philip.

14:04.144 --> 14:06.058
Well, you know what? I am capable

14:06.059 --> 14:07.847
of making my own decisions, okay?

14:07.848 --> 14:10.031
So... so I'm gonna call him right now

14:10.032 --> 14:11.850
and tell him that he can move in tomorrow.

14:11.851 --> 14:13.655
And if you would like to
bring us a housewarming gift,

14:13.656 --> 14:16.938
may I suggest a spice rack.
Margot smoked all of mine.

14:18.448 --> 14:19.627
Riley!

14:20.418 --> 14:21.835
You know, it's none of my business,

14:21.836 --> 14:23.483
but have you ever thought about

14:23.484 --> 14:25.127
just telling her you love her?

14:33.196 --> 14:35.704
So you're absolutely sure
that your mom's not coming?

14:35.705 --> 14:38.377
Absolutely. I told her we
lost our liquor license.

14:39.869 --> 14:42.260
And plus, she's busy babysitting Emma.

14:42.261 --> 14:43.177
Okay.

14:47.121 --> 14:48.507
There he is! You ready?

14:48.508 --> 14:49.947
I was born ready.

14:49.948 --> 14:51.797
Well, actually I was born premature.

14:51.798 --> 14:53.445
Ready came around 15.

14:55.866 --> 14:57.279
Why are you blaming me?

14:57.280 --> 14:59.252
I wasn't the one who
ran off at the mouth...

14:59.253 --> 15:01.400
which is a first, by the way... so yay me.

15:01.857 --> 15:02.959
Yay you?

15:02.960 --> 15:04.934
She's not even talking to me. Boo you.

15:05.307 --> 15:07.311
Well, she isn't talking to me, either.

15:07.312 --> 15:08.542
Which at this point, is fine,

15:08.543 --> 15:10.870
because this just isn't me.

15:10.871 --> 15:12.743
Be a mom, be smart,

15:12.744 --> 15:14.914
give advice... who does that?

15:15.618 --> 15:17.166
I didn't sign up for this.

15:17.526 --> 15:19.782
I don't want to be anybody's mom.

15:19.783 --> 15:21.873
Honestly, I wish she had never found out.

15:22.175 --> 15:23.634
Riley...

15:25.055 --> 15:26.161
um...

15:26.561 --> 15:27.836
I'm sorry, Margot.

15:27.837 --> 15:31.016
I didn't realize that being my
mother would be such a burden.

15:31.017 --> 15:32.419
Riley, wait.

15:32.420 --> 15:33.848
I should probably go after her.

15:33.849 --> 15:35.693
No, I think I should handle this one.

15:39.693 --> 15:42.325
Testing. One, two. One, two.

15:42.818 --> 15:44.022
Hey, everybody.

15:44.023 --> 15:46.558
I'd like to welcome you
to the engagement party

15:47.168 --> 15:48.617
of Brad...

15:49.903 --> 15:51.185
And that girl.

15:52.679 --> 15:55.240
We just wanted to do a
little something special

15:55.241 --> 15:57.741
to let you know how much
you really mean to us.

15:58.352 --> 16:00.163
All right, move over.

16:00.164 --> 16:01.335
I didn't suffer through 12 summers

16:01.336 --> 16:02.842
of piano camp for nothing. Move!

16:08.941 --> 16:10.079
Hello.

16:14.285 --> 16:16.087
I'd like to take a moment

16:17.090 --> 16:19.274
to dedicate this next song

16:20.334 --> 16:22.672
to all the ladies out there

16:23.187 --> 16:24.901
who can't seem to break

16:26.005 --> 16:27.737
a Brad habit.

16:34.100 --> 16:36.054
- Mrs. Wheeler...
- I'm sorry, sorry.

16:36.801 --> 16:38.161
Um, a little help.

16:38.511 --> 16:39.789
Just give me... just...

18:09.172 --> 18:11.554
Oh, right. That was her name.

18:14.157 --> 18:15.810
<i>You're always right.</i>

18:15.811 --> 18:17.824
You always know the perfect thing to say.

18:19.575 --> 18:21.522
All right. Say hi to dad for me.

18:21.523 --> 18:23.053
Yeah, I love you too.

18:25.670 --> 18:27.375
- Your mom?
- Mm-hmm.

18:27.376 --> 18:28.732
What a coincidence.

18:28.733 --> 18:30.211
Great timing. You know, sometimes moms...

18:30.212 --> 18:32.228
it's okay. She told me that you called her.

18:32.807 --> 18:34.041
Thank you.

18:34.531 --> 18:35.964
So what did she say?

18:35.965 --> 18:37.717
Uh, well, um...

18:37.718 --> 18:39.153
She told me that I should follow my gut.

18:39.968 --> 18:41.797
And my gut tells me...

18:42.395 --> 18:44.503
actually, it's kind of
always told me that...

18:45.333 --> 18:47.187
It's too soon for him to move in.

18:47.927 --> 18:49.246
Look...

18:49.247 --> 18:51.135
I know you want Margot
to be the perfect mom.

18:51.520 --> 18:53.295
But she knew that she couldn't be.

18:53.296 --> 18:55.265
So she gave you to a woman who could.

18:55.985 --> 18:58.021
How about you just let Margot be Margot

18:58.022 --> 18:59.684
and leave the mom stuff to an expert?

19:00.184 --> 19:01.238
Your mom.

19:02.133 --> 19:03.462
Wow, that was so insightful.

19:04.027 --> 19:05.423
You'd actually make a great mom.

19:06.206 --> 19:08.441
I know. That's what I keep telling people.

19:15.605 --> 19:18.175
Of all the engagement
parties in all the towns

19:18.176 --> 19:19.276
in all the world,

19:20.058 --> 19:22.294
you had to walk into mine.

19:23.004 --> 19:24.631
Here's looking at us, kid.

19:27.078 --> 19:29.215
- Bonnie...
- I knew you'd come back.

19:29.525 --> 19:30.842
To thank you.

19:31.437 --> 19:33.154
For stopping me from
making the biggest mistake

19:33.155 --> 19:34.301
of my life.

19:35.123 --> 19:37.395
And to tell you that I can't do this.

19:37.708 --> 19:39.147
Us.

19:39.148 --> 19:40.505
Not right now.

19:41.889 --> 19:43.049
But why not?

19:43.364 --> 19:44.844
I mean, we kissed.

19:45.330 --> 19:46.836
We sang together.

19:47.177 --> 19:49.737
And there's more than a 50% chance

19:49.738 --> 19:53.082
that we are about to have
some super-hot makeup sex.

19:54.732 --> 19:57.473
Something Ben said to me
keeps sticking in my head.

19:58.408 --> 19:59.957
He told me that if I could change my mind

19:59.958 --> 20:02.099
that quickly, it wasn't meant to be.

20:02.446 --> 20:03.948
Right now, I think the only person

20:03.949 --> 20:07.642
that I should be with... Is me.

20:12.509 --> 20:13.789
Good-bye, Bonnie.

20:20.342 --> 20:21.540
You know what, mom...

20:22.092 --> 20:23.978
Brad doesn't deserve you.

20:23.979 --> 20:25.277
You're an amazing woman,

20:25.278 --> 20:27.471
and I thank God for you every day.

20:27.841 --> 20:29.906
- Yeah, no.
- Not buying that one?

20:29.907 --> 20:32.195
No no no no. More...

20:32.196 --> 20:35.125
Mom, you are so pretty.

20:35.126 --> 20:36.408
Yeah, what else?

20:36.409 --> 20:37.605
- And sweet.
- Yeah?

20:38.108 --> 20:39.630
- Did I say sweet?
- Yeah, you did.

20:39.631 --> 20:41.250
I got great legs.

20:42.085 --> 20:43.125
- I mean...
- What else?

20:43.126 --> 20:44.449
That's kind of weird 'cause you're my mom.

20:47.471 --> 20:48.519
You guys have fun.

20:48.981 --> 20:50.605
And don't worry about little old me.

20:51.203 --> 20:52.854
Just another Saturday night alone.

20:53.410 --> 20:54.889
With a baby.

20:54.890 --> 20:57.161
And again, it's not mine.

20:57.931 --> 20:59.230
We were thinking this Saturday night

20:59.231 --> 21:00.505
might be a little different.

21:00.506 --> 21:03.173
Because tonight we're all yours.

21:03.174 --> 21:04.367
Oh my God!

21:04.714 --> 21:07.160
That is so sweet, oh!

21:07.161 --> 21:09.586
But if you're staying in, I'm going out.

21:09.587 --> 21:11.008
All right? Bye-bye, Emma.

21:11.323 --> 21:12.730
Don't wait up, boys.

21:13.988 --> 21:15.598
That ain't right.
