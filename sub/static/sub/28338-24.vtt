Greetings, friends!

00:47.540 --> 00:50.380
We would like
to cordially invite you

00:50.380 --> 00:53.290
to the coronation
of Queen Eclipsa!

00:53.290 --> 00:55.500
It's gonna be held
at the Monster Auditorium,

00:55.500 --> 00:58.670
[shouting] and there's gonna
be food and music!

00:58.670 --> 01:01.620
You don't have to yell.

01:01.620 --> 01:03.620
...and a bounce house
for the kids!

01:03.620 --> 01:06.460
So, can we expect
to see you there?

01:06.460 --> 01:09.830
Heh heh!
Oh, we're dying to go!

01:09.830 --> 01:12.500
Yeah, we'd kill
for a front row seat.

01:12.500 --> 01:15.500
Uh, did you guys say
"of corpse" yet?

01:16.460 --> 01:19.580
Awesome!
Love that enthusiasm!

01:19.580 --> 01:22.620
[Marco] Ugh, we still have
so many invitations to hand out!

01:22.620 --> 01:24.460
How are we gonna
deliver them all?

01:24.460 --> 01:27.120
[sigh] C'mon, here.
Let me show you how it's done.

01:27.120 --> 01:28.710
Hello, sir.

01:28.710 --> 01:31.000
Hand these out to 300
of your friends before midnight

01:31.000 --> 01:33.210
-or you'll die.
-Aaaahhh!

01:33.210 --> 01:34.960
She's joking!

01:34.960 --> 01:38.710
I dunno, maybe it's crazy
to think my mom would go.

01:38.710 --> 01:41.920
I think she'd be crazy not
to go to the cornonation.

01:41.920 --> 01:44.000
Wait, what did you call it?

01:44.000 --> 01:45.880
Corn-o-nation?

01:45.880 --> 01:48.250
That's what it says
on the invitation.

01:48.250 --> 01:49.420
What?!

01:49.420 --> 01:50.880
No, no!
No no no no no!

01:50.880 --> 01:53.040
It's supposed
to say "coronation."

01:53.040 --> 01:55.210
Rrrr! Marco!

01:55.210 --> 01:57.420
You were supposed
to spell-check the invitation.

01:57.420 --> 01:59.080
Well, if you
think about it,

01:59.080 --> 02:00.420
Mewni is sort of
the only dimension

02:00.420 --> 02:02.540
where that kinda makes sense.

02:02.540 --> 02:04.670
We're pretty obsessed
with corn.

02:04.670 --> 02:07.620
Whoa, where did all
these people come from?

02:07.620 --> 02:09.210
I think they all live here?

02:09.210 --> 02:10.880
[laughter]

02:10.880 --> 02:13.120
I hear she's still
doing dark magic.

02:13.120 --> 02:14.500
I am not surprised.

02:14.500 --> 02:16.880
Well, I heard she keeps
Globgor in a crystal

02:16.880 --> 02:18.500
and talks
to him every night!

02:18.500 --> 02:20.290
What a monster fangirl!

02:20.290 --> 02:22.830
I wouldn't go to
that cornonation if you paid me!

02:22.830 --> 02:25.710
See, cornonation!
Totally works.

02:25.710 --> 02:28.750
Wait a minute.
Is that Manfred?!

02:28.750 --> 02:29.750
Manfred!

02:29.750 --> 02:31.670
Star Butterfly?!

02:31.670 --> 02:33.120
It is you!

02:33.120 --> 02:34.670
How did you get
all "unyadda-yadda'd"?

02:34.670 --> 02:36.880
Ugh, I don't want
to get into that.

02:36.880 --> 02:40.420
I'm just glad that
Queen Moon has created
this beautiful oasis

02:40.420 --> 02:42.880
for all those who oppose
Eclipsa's reign!

02:42.880 --> 02:44.580
Wait,
my mom did what?

02:44.580 --> 02:48.210
Manfred! There's no need
for such divisive language here!

02:48.210 --> 02:50.290
-Mama!
-Oh, please, Moon!

02:50.290 --> 02:52.880
All those who oppose
Eclipsa, say aye!

02:52.880 --> 02:54.620
[villagers] Aye!

02:54.620 --> 02:56.000
All right,
that's enough out of you.

02:56.000 --> 02:57.460
Go make yourself useful.

02:57.460 --> 02:58.670
That goes for you as well!

02:58.670 --> 02:59.670
-Okay.
-Yes, my queen.

02:59.670 --> 03:00.920
Fine, Queen Moon.

03:00.920 --> 03:04.080
Star! Tom!
So sorry about that!

03:04.080 --> 03:05.670
Uh, yeah.

03:05.670 --> 03:08.540
Uh, does everyone in this town
really hate Eclipsa?

03:08.540 --> 03:09.920
Of course not!

03:09.920 --> 03:11.380
Don't listen to Manfred.

03:11.380 --> 03:13.290
He loves his gossip.

03:13.290 --> 03:15.120
Okay, cool,
because I brought you this!

03:15.120 --> 03:17.210
It's an invitation to
Eclipsa's official coronation!

03:17.210 --> 03:20.420
It would really, really mean
a lot to me if you came.

03:20.420 --> 03:22.580
It would send the message
that Eclipsa isn't a villain.

03:22.580 --> 03:25.500
-Oh, sweetie, I--
-[River] Absolutely not!

03:25.500 --> 03:27.620
I hate those stuffy
royal ceremonies.

03:27.620 --> 03:29.000
They make you wear
itchy clothes

03:29.000 --> 03:31.710
and eat weird tiny food
off those little plates!

03:31.710 --> 03:33.210
Besides,
I already made plans

03:33.210 --> 03:35.330
to go Bogbeast hunting
with Eddie!

03:35.330 --> 03:36.670
Oh! Thomas m'boy!

03:36.670 --> 03:38.380
You're
a strapping young lad.

03:38.380 --> 03:40.330
What say you come with us?

03:40.330 --> 03:42.080
Oh, I'm not really
the outdoorsy--

03:42.080 --> 03:43.500
Well, at least take a look

03:43.500 --> 03:44.920
at my bogging gear
before you go!

03:44.920 --> 03:46.710
-[Tom] Okay, I guess!
-Aah!

03:46.710 --> 03:49.120
Look, this will be
the last thing I do for Eclipsa!

03:49.120 --> 03:51.170
Seriously,
after this, I am out!

03:51.170 --> 03:52.540
I just want
to be a teen again.

03:52.540 --> 03:54.710
I don't even know
what teens do anymore.

03:54.710 --> 03:56.380
Like... do they jet-ski?
Do scrapbook?

03:56.380 --> 03:57.710
What do they do?!

03:59.170 --> 04:02.540
Oh, Star.
You've grown up so much.

04:02.540 --> 04:04.380
Aww, Mom.

04:04.380 --> 04:07.880
Your devotion to the kingdom
is truly commendable.

04:07.880 --> 04:10.170
-So you'll come?
-I didn't say that.

04:10.170 --> 04:13.210
I still have my reservations
about Eclipsa.

04:13.210 --> 04:15.380
Okay, and you don't
have to support Eclipsa,

04:15.380 --> 04:17.540
but could you support me?

04:17.540 --> 04:18.790
[River] Avast!

04:18.790 --> 04:20.170
[grunting]

04:20.170 --> 04:22.420
Bogbeast straight ahead!

04:22.420 --> 04:23.460
I'll get him!!

-[terrified screams]
-[River laughing]

04:29.920 --> 04:31.460
[muffled] Whoo-hoo!

04:31.460 --> 04:34.000
Well, that's my cue
to get going.

04:34.000 --> 04:35.790
Lots more invites to hand out.

04:35.790 --> 04:37.670
Good--
Good luck, sweetie!

04:37.670 --> 04:38.670
Thanks, Mom!

04:39.670 --> 04:41.580
Corn-o-nation?

04:41.580 --> 04:43.670
Somebody forgot
to spell-check.

04:43.670 --> 04:46.620

04:58.670 --> 05:00.710
Five minutes to curtain,
everybody! Five minutes!

05:00.710 --> 05:03.710
I dunno, Tom,
are you sure I shouldn't
wear my meat blanket?

05:03.710 --> 05:05.710
Dude, trust me on this one.

05:05.710 --> 05:07.330
I'm just saying,
it would be way cooler

05:07.330 --> 05:09.620
if you knew some
Love Sentence covers.

05:09.620 --> 05:11.040
Okay, seriously,
who are you?

05:11.040 --> 05:12.420
Who is this person?
Why is she here?

05:12.420 --> 05:13.830
Hey, has anyone seen Eclipsa?

05:13.830 --> 05:15.540
-[Ponyhead sisters

-[gasp]

05:15.540 --> 05:18.380
Hey! Hey, no no no no no,
Ponyheads, get away from her!

05:18.380 --> 05:20.620
Chill out, B-Fly!
Your girl is in good hands,

05:20.620 --> 05:22.620
like, figuratively
or whatever.

05:22.620 --> 05:24.290
I swear to corn,
if you are dolling her up

05:24.290 --> 05:26.830
in another one of those
rocker getups, so help me--

05:26.830 --> 05:29.420
Wait, baby girl!
It's the reveal! Mm.

05:31.670 --> 05:33.620
How do I look?

05:33.620 --> 05:34.750
Oof!

05:34.750 --> 05:36.710
You look
like a real life queen!

05:36.710 --> 05:38.620
Thank you, Star.

05:38.620 --> 05:41.040
You've been
so helpful to me
these past few months.

05:41.040 --> 05:43.250
Oh, no, you would
have figured it out.

05:43.250 --> 05:44.620
Maybe.

05:44.620 --> 05:46.080
I'm so glad
you could come.

05:46.080 --> 05:48.120
And Meteora is, too.

05:48.120 --> 05:50.620
Meteora! Come say
hello to Star!

05:50.620 --> 05:53.710
[growling and babbling]

05:53.710 --> 05:55.000
Aah!

05:55.000 --> 05:56.670
Oh, no no no no no-- Oof!

05:56.670 --> 05:59.290
Now, what did I tell you
about climbing
in your formal wear?

05:59.290 --> 06:01.710
Aww, look at you,
li'l dressed-up baby!

06:01.710 --> 06:05.170
Aw, li'l baby,
you all ready
to be baby coronated?

06:05.170 --> 06:07.750
Well, you can't be coronated
without a coronation song!

06:07.750 --> 06:10.380
Should we practice
one last time, my Queen?

06:10.380 --> 06:11.920
Oh, of course!

06:11.920 --> 06:14.710
This song must go off
without a hitch.

06:14.710 --> 06:17.670
Goodness gracious,
why do all our ceremonies
have to have songs?

06:17.670 --> 06:19.880
Because that's the way
that queens get coronated!

06:19.880 --> 06:21.920
They play the song,
the people cheer,

06:21.920 --> 06:24.420
and voilà,
a newly coronated queen.

06:24.420 --> 06:26.750
Just sayin', coulda been
a dance or something.

06:26.750 --> 06:28.710
Oh, when did this happen?

06:28.710 --> 06:30.880
Seems we're having
some technical difficulties.

06:30.880 --> 06:32.960
I believe I have a spare set
of strings back at the temple.

06:32.960 --> 06:34.170
Won't take but a minute.

06:34.170 --> 06:35.710
-No-n-no w-w-wait!
-Wait!

06:39.710 --> 06:41.710
Ahh! Classic Eclipsa.

06:41.710 --> 06:44.620
Star!
You gotta see this!

06:44.620 --> 06:47.330
[gasp]
Mom! She came!

06:47.330 --> 06:48.960
Hey, Mom! Mom! Mom!

06:48.960 --> 06:51.790
Over here! Mom!

06:51.790 --> 06:53.790
[loud whisper]
Thank you!

06:53.790 --> 06:55.210
[Star]
Uh-huh, uh-huh.

06:55.210 --> 06:58.540
Oooooh, she says
Dad is Bogbeast hunting.

06:58.540 --> 06:59.830
And...

06:59.830 --> 07:02.670
Ugh! Mom!

07:02.670 --> 07:04.920
[sigh] She says
we look cute together.

07:04.920 --> 07:06.210
Awww!

07:06.210 --> 07:07.790
Everything is
finally coming together!

07:07.790 --> 07:09.460
Ahhh! I can't believe it!

07:09.460 --> 07:11.380
You're pretty excited, huh?

07:11.380 --> 07:13.790
Yeah! I mean,
I know things with Eclipsa
haven't been perfect...

07:13.790 --> 07:15.460
Mm-hmm.

07:15.460 --> 07:18.880
But after today, I feel
like I can actually move on!

07:18.880 --> 07:20.670
Whoa, 'cause I've
actually been thinking,

07:20.670 --> 07:24.250
we could move on
to somewhere else!

07:24.250 --> 07:26.040
Maybe like a trip
or something?

07:26.040 --> 07:28.670
Aww, Tom,
that is so sweet!

07:28.670 --> 07:29.670
-Mmm!
-Star!

07:29.670 --> 07:30.670
-Aah!
-Aah!

07:30.670 --> 07:32.580
Where is Queen Eclipsa?

07:32.580 --> 07:34.380
Slow your roll, Rubes,
there's no need to panic!

07:34.380 --> 07:37.210
Two minutes to curtain!
Time to start panicking!

07:37.210 --> 07:40.790
But it wouldn't hurt
to check on Eclipsa.

07:40.790 --> 07:43.120
Eclipsa? It's almost time.

07:44.830 --> 07:46.670
Where is she?

07:46.670 --> 07:48.540
Eclipsa!

07:50.790 --> 07:51.790
Uh, Eclipsa?

07:52.960 --> 07:55.170
Oh, Eclipsa!

07:55.170 --> 07:57.580
Huh.
Must have just missed her.

08:01.000 --> 08:02.790

08:02.790 --> 08:04.790
Mmm, that's good, mmm-hmm.

-Huh?!

08:21.120 --> 08:23.330
Attention, everyone!

08:23.330 --> 08:25.620

you all home immediately.

-What?

08:29.330 --> 08:31.670
[Eclipsa]
Please, stay calm!

08:31.670 --> 08:33.620
Once we've evacuated you,
return to your homes,

08:33.620 --> 08:35.710
lock your doors,
bar your windows--

08:35.710 --> 08:38.000
No! Everyone,
stay where you are!

08:38.000 --> 08:39.790
Don't listen to Eclipsa!

08:39.790 --> 08:41.920
That's just what Globgor
wants you to do!

08:41.920 --> 08:43.710
He'll pick you off
one by one!

[Eclipsa]
What are you doing?!

08:44.880 --> 08:46.920
I'm trying to
protect everyone!

You're not trying to protect
anyone, you traitor!

a state of emergency!

08:54.880 --> 08:56.420
All residents of Mewni

08:56.420 --> 08:58.920
must remain in their seats
until further notice.

09:00.670 --> 09:01.830
What's going on?

09:01.830 --> 09:03.500
We wait here
until the threat

09:03.500 --> 09:06.500
-of Globgor is neutralized.
-Mama!

09:06.500 --> 09:08.210
That should keep her
outta trouble.

09:08.210 --> 09:11.080
-Oh...
-Come on, let's go.

09:12.960 --> 09:14.580
Things do not
look good out there.

09:14.580 --> 09:15.670
[nervous whine]

09:15.670 --> 09:16.960
We need some sort of-- huh...

09:16.960 --> 09:19.710
-Aha! A distraction!
-Hey!

09:19.710 --> 09:21.080
Hey, everybody!

09:21.080 --> 09:23.120
What's more fun
than a cornonation?

09:23.120 --> 09:24.830
[man] Sit down, kid!

09:24.830 --> 09:26.330
That's right!

09:26.330 --> 09:28.290
A talent show!

09:28.290 --> 09:30.710
Uh, hold on, Marco.
We are artists.

09:30.710 --> 09:33.580
We can't just put
on a talent show
with no preparation--

09:33.580 --> 09:34.790
I'm ready!

09:37.120 --> 09:38.920
-[Star] Rhombulus.
-Huh?

09:38.920 --> 09:40.880
I need a moment alone
with the Queen.

09:40.880 --> 09:42.620
Uhh, I dunno.

09:42.620 --> 09:45.000
What if you help her
escape or something?

09:45.000 --> 09:46.960
Do I look like
I'm going to help her?

09:46.960 --> 09:48.500
Ohhh. Okay.

09:48.500 --> 09:50.580
But I'm gonna be right
over there, watching.

09:51.920 --> 09:53.750
Star, thank goodness.

09:53.750 --> 09:54.920
You have to believe me.

09:54.920 --> 09:56.540
I swear I didn't let--

09:56.540 --> 09:58.920
Stop! I don't know
what to believe.

09:58.920 --> 10:00.080
All I know is that
I need to find Globgor

10:00.080 --> 10:01.500
before he hurts somebody.

10:01.500 --> 10:03.080
Do you have any idea
where he might have gone?

10:03.080 --> 10:06.120
No. I'm not sure.

10:06.120 --> 10:07.420
Ha ha!

10:07.420 --> 10:09.710
You think that liar
is gonna tell you?

10:09.710 --> 10:11.380
She doesn't care
about Mewni.

10:11.380 --> 10:14.920
All she cares about is
her freak monster family.

10:14.920 --> 10:15.920
[sigh]

10:17.210 --> 10:18.380
[gasp]

10:18.380 --> 10:19.790

10:19.790 --> 10:21.960
He-- He might
be at the bog.

10:21.960 --> 10:24.670
It was a special place
for us.

10:26.880 --> 10:30.670
You sure you shouldn't
be with the family
at the cornonation?

10:30.670 --> 10:33.250
And abandon
you in your time of need?

10:33.250 --> 10:34.960
Eddie, you're stressed!

10:34.960 --> 10:36.670
You need me!

10:36.670 --> 10:37.920
I ain't stressed.

10:37.920 --> 10:39.750
Of course you are!

10:39.750 --> 10:41.460
How could you not be?

10:41.460 --> 10:44.960
You live in the wild with
danger lurking every night.

10:44.960 --> 10:48.830
You have a sneaking suspicion
that no one takes you seriously,

10:48.830 --> 10:51.170
including your own wife.

10:51.170 --> 10:53.170
And then there's the case
of your daughter.

10:57.000 --> 10:58.290
Very much!

10:58.290 --> 11:02.170
But sometimes you wonder
if you and Moon

11:02.170 --> 11:04.330
would have
been better off if...

11:04.330 --> 11:06.080
A bug.

11:06.080 --> 11:09.580
Well, the point is,
you have a lot on your mind.

11:10.750 --> 11:14.040
Wowee, I am stressed!

11:14.040 --> 11:15.330
I wonder if it also has to do

11:15.330 --> 11:17.040
with that beast
that's approaching.

That's Globgor!

Good luck, sweetie!
I'm proud of you!

12:07.620 --> 12:10.080
Globgor! You need
to come with me! Now!

12:10.080 --> 12:12.120
No! You stay away from me!

12:12.120 --> 12:14.120
You know I can't do that!

12:16.830 --> 12:18.750
Don't make this more difficult!

Oh, okay, I'm sorry!
I'm sorry!

12:36.210 --> 12:39.210
Look, I have to go
far, far away from here!

12:39.210 --> 12:40.920
If the Mewmans
find out I'm free,

12:40.920 --> 12:43.250
they're just gonna
take it out on my family.

12:43.250 --> 12:44.880
So you're not gonna
hurt anyone?

12:44.880 --> 12:47.830
What?! No! Of course not.

12:51.880 --> 12:55.040
Look, Globgor,
Eclipsa and Meteora
are already in danger.

supposed to do?

Boom.

to be a talent show!

Yeah, that's funny,
'cause he didn't
do anything

18:37.580 --> 18:39.620
but try and
get away from you!

18:39.620 --> 18:41.620
Well... maybe this time,
he didn't hurt anyone,

18:41.620 --> 18:44.540
but sooner or later,
he'll show his true colors!

18:44.540 --> 18:46.000
And so will Eclipsa!

18:46.000 --> 18:49.290
She's evil! I've seen
it with my own eye!

18:49.290 --> 18:51.210
Are you kidding me?!

18:51.210 --> 18:53.000
We don't trust
Eclipsa either,

18:53.000 --> 18:56.710
but if you think putting
everyone here in danger
was a good idea,

18:56.710 --> 18:58.460
you're the bad guy here!

18:58.460 --> 19:01.500
Guards! You know what to do.

19:01.500 --> 19:02.830
-Hut hut hut hut hut hut!
-Huh? No, no, wait!

19:02.830 --> 19:04.420
I can explain!

19:04.420 --> 19:06.580
Aw, pipe down,
big guy!

19:06.580 --> 19:08.210
[Globgor] It doesn't matter
who let me out.

19:08.210 --> 19:10.460
I'm free,
but I can't stay here.

19:11.880 --> 19:14.170
These people
are afraid of me.

19:14.170 --> 19:15.880
But if they're
afraid of you,

19:15.880 --> 19:17.580
why are they still here?

19:17.580 --> 19:21.080
Perhaps... they should decide.

19:21.080 --> 19:23.210
-[confused murmurs]
-Wait, what do you mean, decide?

19:23.210 --> 19:24.960
You may not all love me,

19:24.960 --> 19:27.500
but you've accepted me
as your queen.

19:27.500 --> 19:30.170
Will you accept
my husband as well?

19:30.170 --> 19:31.880
Wait, you want us to choose?

19:31.880 --> 19:34.500
This is a monarchy,
not a democracy!

19:34.500 --> 19:36.580
Wait, what
does Queen Moon think?

19:37.920 --> 19:40.750
Ugh, how many times
must I tell you,

19:40.750 --> 19:43.000
I'm not your queen anymore!

19:43.000 --> 19:44.920
It doesn't matter
what I think!

19:45.880 --> 19:47.330
Hmm... I dunno.

19:47.330 --> 19:49.620
Didn't he used to,
like, eat people?

19:49.620 --> 19:52.880
Wasn't he just trying
to protect his family
from angry Mewmans?

19:52.880 --> 19:55.500
I don't know how to respond
to this shift in the paradigm!

19:55.500 --> 19:57.880
I think
we should give him chance!

19:57.880 --> 20:00.960
Is true, Globgor is free now.

20:00.960 --> 20:04.170
For some
is Mewman's greatest fear.

20:04.170 --> 20:05.790
But now it has happened!

20:05.790 --> 20:07.500
And it not so bad!

20:07.500 --> 20:11.500
He seem like big proud papa.
Like Buffrog!

20:11.500 --> 20:13.710
Dude, we're fine.
You can put us down now.

20:13.710 --> 20:15.420
Can't we all
put the past behind us

20:15.420 --> 20:16.920
and make a fresh start?

20:16.920 --> 20:18.540
-Awwww!
-Ohhh!

20:18.540 --> 20:21.290
Yeah, what
that fish kid said!

20:21.290 --> 20:23.040
[cheering]

20:24.330 --> 20:25.460
Huh.

20:25.460 --> 20:27.670
Well, I guess
this is happening.

20:27.670 --> 20:30.080
Uh, so does this mean
I'm off the hook?

20:30.080 --> 20:32.500
Ha! Yeah, you wish.

20:32.500 --> 20:35.670
C'mon, hotshot,
we got a prison cell
with your name on it.

20:35.670 --> 20:37.790
[cooing]

20:38.920 --> 20:41.540
-Aaaah!
-Oof!

20:41.540 --> 20:43.580
So, Queen! I know
a lot just happened,

20:43.580 --> 20:45.880
but it's
still your coronation!

20:45.880 --> 20:47.750
Shall we make
