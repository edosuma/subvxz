| thought you guys were
going to your parents' house.

00:06.256 --> 00:08.372

parents are going to sex camp.

Alex is like a kid
on Christmas morning.

00:21.647 --> 00:22.352
(SINGSONG VOICE)
Yes, I'm getting good at this!

00:22.648 --> 00:24.230
Mmm-mmm.

00:24.525 --> 00:26.357
There's nothing like the first
delicious rip of wrapping paper.

00:26.652 --> 00:27.733
The gift teases you
with what's inside,

00:28.028 --> 00:29.268
you see those letters,
C-H-U...

00:30.697 --> 00:31.437
And you know
it's chutes and ladders.

00:33.617 --> 00:35.904
Except for that one time that it
was a chubby checker chess set. Uh!

00:36.203 --> 00:36.817
Hey, guys. What can |
get for you today?

00:37.120 --> 00:39.202

00:39.498 --> 00:40.784

holiday beverage.

00:41.083 --> 00:41.743
You can drink it
any way you want.

00:42.042 --> 00:43.783
Straight, on the rocks.

00:44.086 --> 00:45.952
You can throw a shot of sake
in there, call it a Nagasaki bomb.

00:46.255 --> 00:48.496
(WHISPERS LOUDLY)
Uh-oh! Did he hear that?

00:48.799 --> 00:50.381
Did the Asian waiter
hear that?

00:50.676 --> 00:52.166
Okay. I just need some IDs.

00:52.469 --> 00:55.552
Ugh! Carded again?
When will I look my age?

00:55.847 --> 00:58.555
Curse this amazing alabaster
complexion. What a hassle.

00:58.850 --> 00:59.760
Well, not just
yours, ma'am.

01:00.060 --> 01:01.516
Ma'am? WAITER: I
need everybody's IDs.

01:01.812 --> 01:02.847
Some kids have been
sneaking in with some fakes.

01:03.146 --> 01:05.638
Ah! I remember
my first fake ID.

01:05.941 --> 01:08.478

Jane Kerkovich-Williams?

01:16.159 --> 01:17.365
Yes.

01:17.661 --> 01:19.698
Is her height five feet
eight inches? Yes.

01:19.997 --> 01:22.739
Is her eye color
frosted spruce? Yes.

01:23.041 --> 01:24.907
Did she have to petition
the Illinois secretary of state

01:25.210 --> 01:27.326
to allow her to have
this color on her license?

01:27.629 --> 01:29.415
No. He's a good friend
of ours. Mmm-hmm.

01:29.715 --> 01:30.329

call the cops if you want.

Whoa!

the cops 'cause I'm black?

01:35.429 --> 01:36.419
Call the cops, man.

01:36.722 --> 01:37.837
Okay, it is a fake ID.

01:39.891 --> 01:41.427
Wait. Jane,
why you have a fake ID?

So just Jane?

01:58.785 --> 02:00.025
Yeah.

02:00.329 --> 02:02.696
Christmas baby, you
say? Weird. (CHUCKLES)

02:02.998 --> 02:04.955

to me about your birthday.

02:18.805 --> 02:20.011
| thought you were
older than me.

02:20.307 --> 02:21.889
| thought I was married
to a MILF.

02:22.184 --> 02:25.347
Now all those fantasies about
her being my Dad's new wife

02:25.646 --> 02:28.229
and giving me a bath and
swaddling me don't make any sense.

02:28.523 --> 02:30.434
(HIGH-PITCHED VOICE)
What? What? What? What?

02:30.734 --> 02:33.852
Why would a younger woman
give me a bath and swaddle me?

It's weird!
Yeah, it's weird.

02:35.864 --> 02:37.571
Look, when your birthday
is on Christmas,

02:37.866 --> 02:39.857

forgotten about.

One Christmas birthday morn,

02:44.998 --> 02:47.285

02:47.584 --> 02:50.246
to find me Mum and Pop
waiting for me.

02:50.545 --> 02:51.626
Wait. Are you Madonna
in this story?

02:51.922 --> 02:54.038
And, lo,

02:54.341 --> 02:56.082

a Christmas gift.

Good story.
It's over now, right?

03:01.181 --> 03:01.716
Shh! I wanna hear
what happens.

03:02.015 --> 03:03.096
You were there.

03:03.392 --> 03:04.723
Well, there was another gift
waiting for me.

03:05.018 --> 03:06.349
A birthday gift.

03:06.645 --> 03:07.851
Was it a sleigh?

03:08.146 --> 03:09.636
Hmm!

03:09.940 --> 03:11.681

my childhood

Christmas/birthday combo gift.

Oof.
Roof stoof.

03:29.084 --> 03:30.324

having two parents.

03:30.627 --> 03:31.958
Yeah. Sorry.

03:32.254 --> 03:35.042
So... I sat my folks down

03:35.340 --> 03:37.126
and I said, "From now on,
my birthday will be July 16th."

03:38.093 --> 03:39.424
And, you know,

03:39.720 --> 03:42.758

you had to change your birthday.

with you and Max starting a black circus.

Although what is gonna
be open on Christmas?

A gas station?
A drugstore?

08:00.772 --> 08:02.103
Israel?

08:02.399 --> 08:04.515
Pen, it's not about
the gift per se.

08:04.818 --> 08:05.979
It's about taking Pete
on a journey.

08:06.277 --> 08:08.564

We are gonna take Pete
on a fun-filled scavenger hunt

08:22.669 --> 08:25.127
that leads to Arcade Fire
tickets hidden in his apartment.

08:25.422 --> 08:26.912
Oh, my God,
that's genius!

08:27.215 --> 08:29.252
How did you think of
that in, like, 20 seconds?

08:29.551 --> 08:31.258
Actually, I came up with it
in the first five seconds.

08:31.553 --> 08:33.009
The last 15 seconds
were spent wondering

08:33.304 --> 08:34.544
whether or not I should
shave my goatee.

08:34.847 --> 08:36.134
Ah.

08:36.433 --> 08:38.924
And the answer is
a-big, a-fat, a no.

08:39.227 --> 08:40.763

on that one.

But I really did love
the candle.

17:55.741 --> 17:57.448
And there's a very
sweet story behind it.

17:57.743 --> 17:59.404
One night, Pete and I were
watching Contagion,

17:59.704 --> 18:02.116
and he said if I were ever
dying like Gwyneth Paltrow,

18:02.415 --> 18:03.997
he wouldn't let me suffer.

18:04.292 --> 18:05.953
He'd put a bullet in my head

18:06.252 --> 18:07.868
and then light the biggest
candle he could find

18:08.170 --> 18:09.752
to match my big heart.

18:10.047 --> 18:10.627
(VOICE BREAKS)
Pete said that?

18:10.923 --> 18:12.539
| kKnow!

18:12.842 --> 18:13.957
No guy has ever offered
to kill me.

18:15.011 --> 18:16.467
Well, one did,

18:16.762 --> 18:18.423
but it was during sex,
so I don't think that counts.

18:18.723 --> 18:22.182
Wow. So the candle is a
symbol of your relationship.

18:22.476 --> 18:23.932
It shines a light where you've
been and we're you're going.

18:25.313 --> 18:26.519
Damn it.
Mmm.

parents gave me a bike.

gave me air for the tires.
