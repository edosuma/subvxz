00:03.649 --> 00:04.849
[panting]

00:04.850 --> 00:06.177
What the fuck was that?

00:06.178 --> 00:10.055
That was October 21, 1960.

00:10.056 --> 00:11.146
[laughter]

00:11.147 --> 00:13.075
Al, why did you show this to me?

00:13.076 --> 00:15.195
I don't know whether Oswald
was the man who did it.

00:15.196 --> 00:17.095
- Who's this?
- General Walker.

00:17.096 --> 00:18.692
Ran for Texas governor.

00:18.693 --> 00:21.202
There was an assassination
attempt on this man.

00:21.203 --> 00:23.428
Same exact make of gun
that killed Kennedy.

00:23.429 --> 00:25.822
Did you see Oswald shoot at Walker?

00:25.823 --> 00:27.569
George De Mohrenschildt.

00:27.570 --> 00:30.099
If Oswald had a handler, it was him.

00:30.100 --> 00:32.261
Russian expat. Might be an informant.

00:32.262 --> 00:33.479
Might work for Russia.

00:33.480 --> 00:35.599
So on October 26th,
there's something there

00:35.600 --> 00:37.509
you'll really want to see.

00:37.510 --> 00:39.479
Lee Harvey Oswald.

00:39.480 --> 00:42.469
The "past doesn't want
to be changed" thing...

00:42.470 --> 00:43.580
it pushes back?

00:43.581 --> 00:45.509
Things would happen.

00:45.510 --> 00:46.600
I forget everything when I'm reading.

00:46.601 --> 00:48.479
- "From Here to Eternity."
- Sadie Clayton.

00:48.480 --> 00:50.379
Jake Ep... um, Amberson.

00:50.380 --> 00:53.379
They were both random and violent.

00:53.380 --> 00:54.530
You ain't going nowhere.

00:54.531 --> 00:56.983
Frank was married to my
older sister, Clara.

00:56.984 --> 00:58.479
He killed her 12 years ago.

00:58.480 --> 00:59.590
It worked.

00:59.591 --> 01:02.440
Hey, what the hell is this?

01:06.390 --> 01:11.610
[suspenseful music]

01:18.470 --> 01:23.399
How the hell did you
have a paper dated 1963?

01:23.400 --> 01:25.489
You said you knew things

01:25.490 --> 01:27.479
and you know what was gonna happen,

01:27.480 --> 01:31.569
and then you kill Frank Dunning,
and then I find this... hmm?

01:31.570 --> 01:34.489
- I'm taking you to the cops.
- Great.

01:34.490 --> 01:35.610
Well, then they'll arrest us both.

01:35.611 --> 01:37.489
[scoffs] Hell they do.

01:37.490 --> 01:40.469
You were in the house.
You'll be an accomplice.

01:40.470 --> 01:41.510
I didn't do anything.

01:41.511 --> 01:46.519
And what's this about, hmm?

01:46.520 --> 01:51.429
I read all this shit. Baseball
games in 1962 and '63.

01:51.430 --> 01:54.470
Newspaper stories that
haven't happened yet.

01:57.450 --> 02:00.539
I'm here to keep the President
from being assassinated.

02:00.540 --> 02:02.429
Someone's gonna kill Ike?

02:02.430 --> 02:04.569
No. President Kennedy.

02:04.570 --> 02:07.961
[tense music]

So you're saying a guy's going to
kill the President in three years?

03:22.420 --> 03:24.021
Why not take him out right now?

03:24.399 --> 03:27.378
Oswald's in Russia right now.

03:27.379 --> 03:29.318
What the fuck's he doing in Russia?

03:29.319 --> 03:31.458
He defected. He comes back in 1962.

03:31.459 --> 03:34.319
It's... it's complicated.

03:37.299 --> 03:39.278
Prove that you're from the future.

03:39.279 --> 03:40.429

- something I can check.
- I can't...

Fuck, I don't know, uh...

03:46.389 --> 03:49.439
What else can I tell you?
Look in that book.

04:02.489 --> 04:05.448
These fights in 1962...

04:05.449 --> 04:07.378
those are the winners?

04:07.379 --> 04:09.359
Yeah.

04:11.509 --> 04:14.398
If what you say is true,

04:14.399 --> 04:17.398
could you save someone else too?

04:17.399 --> 04:19.309
What?

04:24.409 --> 04:26.368
My sister Clara.

04:26.369 --> 04:28.508
I want Frank Dunning killed.

04:28.509 --> 04:32.469
If you can go to other
times, bring her back.

04:34.409 --> 04:37.369
I can only go back to 1960.

04:40.299 --> 04:42.279
That's how it works. I'm sorry.

04:44.349 --> 04:45.409
Never mind.

04:54.299 --> 04:57.358
Look, drive me to Dallas.
There'll be 100 in it for you.

04:57.359 --> 04:59.388
100...

04:59.389 --> 05:01.278

05:01.279 --> 05:02.469
Yeah, just take me there,

05:02.470 --> 05:05.448
drop me off, and forget you ever saw me.

05:05.449 --> 05:08.318
I could take that 100 off you right now.

05:08.319 --> 05:10.399
Yeah. I guess so. You got the gun.

05:15.379 --> 05:17.498
Fine.

05:17.499 --> 05:20.299
You got yourself a ride...

05:22.309 --> 05:24.279
But I'm keeping this handy.

- All right?

You don't hurt me anymore!

Dealey Plaza.

07:05.480 --> 07:07.358
This is where

07:07.359 --> 07:09.278
the assassination's going to take place.

07:09.279 --> 07:10.469
About 2,000 books written about it,

07:10.470 --> 07:12.499
and no one knows for sure what happened.

07:14.329 --> 07:15.509
That's the book depository.

07:15.510 --> 07:19.288
That's where Lee Harvey
Oswald is going to work...

07:19.289 --> 07:21.308
and maybe he's the shooter,

07:21.309 --> 07:24.409
or maybe it's a CIA
marksman with Lee's gun.

07:26.359 --> 07:28.448
Maybe there's another
shooter over there.

07:28.449 --> 07:30.339
Maybe sent by Russia.

07:32.279 --> 07:35.448
And maybe another shooter... wherever.

07:35.449 --> 07:37.399
Triangulation.

07:39.479 --> 07:42.378
And you think you can figure it?

07:42.379 --> 07:44.468
Maybe.

07:44.469 --> 07:48.278
I know more than people know here yet.

07:48.279 --> 07:50.338
Don't you know everything?

07:50.339 --> 07:53.338
No. Not everything.

07:53.339 --> 07:55.279
That's what scares me.

08:08.449 --> 08:12.398
I was never much for
all that Camelot shit.

08:12.399 --> 08:14.428
I remember walking down the street.

08:14.429 --> 08:16.438
I was just a kid,

08:16.439 --> 08:21.308
and we'd look at each other
for a second, then we'd...

08:21.309 --> 08:23.309
look away.

08:25.449 --> 08:28.299
Some people were crying.

08:30.339 --> 08:35.408
Some people just stopped in
the middle of the sidewalk,

08:35.409 --> 08:39.278
'cause we all knew

08:39.279 --> 08:43.337
something had been broken in all of us,

08:43.339 --> 08:46.339
and it could never get repaired.

08:48.439 --> 08:52.328
Supposedly, Oswald tried
to kill someone else

08:52.329 --> 08:56.298
before Kennedy using the exact same gun,

08:56.299 --> 08:57.479
- so I'm going to follow him...
- Wait, wait.

08:57.480 --> 08:59.358
Who else'd he try to kill?

08:59.359 --> 09:01.428
This politician named General Walker.

09:01.429 --> 09:05.358
So if I see Oswald trying to do that,

09:05.359 --> 09:08.298
and I can prove he's not part
of a conspiracy, then...

09:08.299 --> 09:09.399
Conspiracy?

09:09.400 --> 09:11.348
With who?

09:11.349 --> 09:13.428
The people that really run things.

09:13.429 --> 09:16.328
Maybe the... Look, the point is

09:16.329 --> 09:19.478
if I see Oswald shoot at Walker,
and I know that he's alone...

09:19.479 --> 09:21.369
Kill him, and that saves Kennedy.

09:40.419 --> 09:41.469
Okay.

09:45.439 --> 09:47.468
$100.

09:47.469 --> 09:49.448
I want to save him too.

09:49.449 --> 09:52.488
No. Look, Bill, no. Just go home.

09:52.489 --> 09:54.478
To what?

09:54.479 --> 09:58.309
To Kentucky? I ain't got shit there.

10:00.309 --> 10:04.428
It's just the place my sister
and her baby used to be.

10:04.429 --> 10:09.428
You know, maybe you could use
somebody to have your back.

10:09.429 --> 10:12.349
I listened to you. I believed you.

10:16.479 --> 10:17.499
Fuck it.

10:30.419 --> 10:33.399

10:36.389 --> 10:38.288

10:50.439 --> 10:53.358

10:53.359 --> 10:55.378
Because it's between
Dallas and Fort Worth,

10:55.379 --> 10:58.348
and Oswald's gonna be
living in both places.

10:58.349 --> 10:59.479
We just set up here,

10:59.480 --> 11:01.418
and by the time Oswald
gets back from Russia,

11:01.419 --> 11:03.488
we'll be moved into the
Fort Worth apartment.

11:03.489 --> 11:06.448
We can start betting on games then too.

11:06.449 --> 11:08.498
We still got to get a job.

I like seeing a bit of the
country I fought for.

Why come to a little place like Jodie

11:24.289 --> 11:26.408
when there's plenty of
teaching jobs in Dallas?

11:26.409 --> 11:29.298
I didn't really take to the city.

11:29.299 --> 11:31.298
Well, it is a shithole, all right.

11:43.420 --> 11:45.318
do what they're supposed to do,

11:45.319 --> 11:46.499
so they just send 'em
down here to my office

11:46.500 --> 11:48.398

Mr. Amberson here

12:45.319 --> 12:47.378
had a pretty good answer
to your literary question.

12:47.379 --> 12:49.448
But, of course, that Salinger book

12:49.449 --> 12:52.478
is never going to be in the library.

Hell will freeze over before it is.

all squared away for tomorrow.

anything permanent yet.

has a house for rent.

13:49.439 --> 13:51.318
Come on.

13:51.319 --> 13:54.298
I've lived in a small
town my whole life.

13:54.299 --> 13:55.459
[bluesy rock music]

13:55.460 --> 13:59.338
Whoo! I love you!

13:59.339 --> 14:02.338
Whoo, I love you!

14:02.339 --> 14:05.488
Oh, you are killing me.

14:05.489 --> 14:09.298
So gorgeous. Oh!

14:09.299 --> 14:12.419
She is beautiful!

14:14.309 --> 14:15.388
Fellas okay? Having a good time?

14:15.389 --> 14:16.479
Yeah. Sorry.

14:16.480 --> 14:19.308
I guess my little brother's

14:19.309 --> 14:21.278
having, uh, too much of a good time.

14:21.279 --> 14:23.348
Love to see people having fun.

14:23.349 --> 14:25.358
- This is my place.
- Oh, nice.

14:25.359 --> 14:27.288
Are you gonna vote for Kennedy?

14:27.289 --> 14:31.468
Oh, hey, let's, uh, not
talk politics in here, huh?

14:31.469 --> 14:33.398
You got a problem with Kennedy?

14:33.399 --> 14:34.509
No.

14:34.510 --> 14:36.368
He's a great man.

14:36.369 --> 14:38.318
Couldn't agree more.

14:38.319 --> 14:39.459
Going to turn this country around.

14:39.460 --> 14:41.329
Jack Ruby.

14:43.359 --> 14:45.278
Jack Ruby?

14:45.279 --> 14:46.409
Yeah. Something wrong?

14:46.410 --> 14:48.408
Look like you seen a ghost. [laughs]

14:48.409 --> 14:51.298
You know who else is a great man?

14:51.299 --> 14:52.509
Him.

14:52.510 --> 14:54.458
Little brothers, huh?

14:54.459 --> 14:57.288
They, uh, have that hero worship.

14:57.289 --> 14:59.458
Nah, not me. I hate my fucking brother.

14:59.459 --> 15:02.368
[laughter]

15:02.369 --> 15:04.368
Nah, he wants to do big things.

15:04.369 --> 15:06.378
Okay. I think we should go.

15:06.379 --> 15:08.368
- He is going to do big things.
- Yeah.

15:08.369 --> 15:10.338
He is going to stop bad
things from happening.

15:10.339 --> 15:11.439
Okay. Bill, shut up.

15:11.440 --> 15:13.409
He came from the future.

15:14.509 --> 15:17.458
[chuckles]

15:17.459 --> 15:18.509
All right, here.

15:18.510 --> 15:20.318
Bye, sweetheart.

15:20.319 --> 15:22.439
[jazzy rock and roll continues]

15:30.409 --> 15:32.429
There you go. Thank you.

15:40.499 --> 15:42.339
All right, wake up.

15:43.429 --> 15:44.459
Wake up.

15:50.349 --> 15:52.498
All right, what's the story?

15:52.499 --> 15:54.468
- What story?
- Our story.

15:54.469 --> 15:56.328
How do we know each other?

15:56.329 --> 15:58.418
- We're brothers.
- Mm-hmm.

15:58.419 --> 16:00.478
And...

16:00.479 --> 16:03.308
You were born in Maine.

16:03.309 --> 16:06.378
Later we moved to Kentucky.

16:06.379 --> 16:08.278
You... you went to college in the East.

16:08.279 --> 16:09.419
That's where you lost your accent.

16:09.420 --> 16:11.508
And?

16:11.509 --> 16:13.318
Look... our parents died,

16:13.319 --> 16:14.449
and we sold the farm.

16:14.450 --> 16:17.378
- That's it.
- Never, ever change the story.

16:17.379 --> 16:20.458
You almost fucked up
everything last night, Bill.

16:20.459 --> 16:23.328
I'm sorry.

16:23.329 --> 16:25.498
I'm real sorry.

16:25.499 --> 16:27.378
All right. Come on, now.

16:27.379 --> 16:28.499
You got to drive me to school.

16:28.500 --> 16:30.319
I got to get to work.

16:39.419 --> 16:42.288
May I help you, Mr. Coslaw?

16:42.289 --> 16:44.388
Miss Mimi, can Bobbi Jill
change her section of Home Ec?

16:44.389 --> 16:47.328
- You let Mike talk for you now?
- Yes, ma'am.

Miss Mimi, can I pour you a cup?

No one will find your body.

You can see it happening,

18:04.489 --> 18:07.378
but you cannot stop it,

so how will you get out of there?

18:30.450 --> 18:34.308

Mr. Amberson, this is Miss Dunhill.

18:57.509 --> 19:00.498
- Yeah, we've... we've met before.
- Have we?

In Dallas, about two years ago.

- You...
- I left my bag.

- You left... yeah.
- Oh, how funny.

19:07.399 --> 19:09.298
Yeah. [chuckles]

Miss Dunhill is our new librarian.

19:11.379 --> 19:14.278
Oh, great. Hi.

I was reading, and I left my bag,

returned it to me.

19:18.469 --> 19:21.438
I'm just glad your
husband didn't kill you.

19:21.439 --> 19:23.378
No husband.

19:23.379 --> 19:25.478
No, yeah, you had a ring,

19:25.479 --> 19:27.429
- and you made a joke.
- No husband.

19:29.319 --> 19:30.379
Oh.

19:30.380 --> 19:32.278
Mr. Amberson, we had two teachers

the dance this Thursday.

19:36.379 --> 19:38.338
and Mr. Martin's mother is ill.

Again.

19:39.450 --> 19:41.408
Ms. Dunhill has volunteered,

19:41.409 --> 19:44.288
but it's not possible for
her to chaperone alone.

19:44.289 --> 19:45.429
Will you help?

19:45.430 --> 19:48.298
This Thursday?

19:48.299 --> 19:50.318
Oh, I-I hate to say no.

19:50.319 --> 19:51.318
Then don't.

Oh, the hell you do.

Pardon my French, Miss Dunhill.

No, that's what I was going to say.

gonna be empty long.

said I can't help you.

I cannot buy gas here.

No. I don't think so.

Marine ever to defect.

24:43.510 --> 24:45.428
and we're going to go home as a family,

24:45.429 --> 24:47.458
and we're going to have fried chicken,

his place bugged tonight.

Oswald starts talking about

General Walker and who he
starts talking about him to.

25:09.289 --> 25:11.338

to Communist infiltration.

25:12.490 --> 25:15.458
Yep... just like that.

- Sounds like General Walker.
- Yeah.

with traitors like these.

Got your short-range.

God bless Texas.

26:10.309 --> 26:11.439
God bless.

26:11.440 --> 26:14.378
Hey, you boys going to
the rally next week?

26:14.379 --> 26:15.489
General Walker's having a rally?

26:15.490 --> 26:17.338
I can introduce you.

26:17.339 --> 26:19.308
He has men over his house once a month,

26:19.309 --> 26:21.388
and we all blow about
the crisis in America.

26:21.389 --> 26:23.279
Yeah, maybe. Sounds interesting.

26:26.489 --> 26:28.498
Good luck bugging your wife's place.

26:28.499 --> 26:30.358
You get yourself that divorce.

26:30.359 --> 26:31.479
Okay.

26:31.480 --> 26:33.318
See you, Bill.

26:33.319 --> 26:34.429
Bye, Sarge.

26:35.479 --> 26:37.388
Hey, so, uh...

26:37.389 --> 26:39.358
I'm gonna go back to Jodie tonight.

26:39.359 --> 26:41.428
I'll be back by 10:00.

26:41.429 --> 26:43.318
[singing on radio] Everybody's doing

26:43.319 --> 26:45.398
a brand-new dance now.

26:45.399 --> 26:49.288
Come on, baby, do the loco-motion.

26:49.289 --> 26:50.438
I know you'll get to like it

26:50.439 --> 26:51.509
if you give it a chance now.

26:51.510 --> 26:55.358
Come on, baby, do the loco-motion.

26:55.359 --> 26:58.508
How's it going, partner?

26:58.509 --> 27:01.308
- Made a bust.
- Whoa. Ha ha ho.

27:01.309 --> 27:02.509
Can we smoke what we confiscate?

27:02.510 --> 27:05.378
Yeah, although I think
we have bigger troubles.

27:05.379 --> 27:07.378
That's Jim LaDue, quarterback.

27:07.379 --> 27:09.488
Danny Parsich, and Phillip Gardener.

27:09.489 --> 27:11.398
Master criminals.

27:11.399 --> 27:13.469
Let's get 'em.

27:15.489 --> 27:17.438
Jimla!

27:17.439 --> 27:19.328
How's it going?

27:19.329 --> 27:21.498
Got anything for me, guys?

27:21.499 --> 27:23.468
- Nope.
- Uh-uh.

27:23.469 --> 27:25.448
Come on, cough it up to the lady.

27:25.449 --> 27:28.368
All of you. Come on.

27:28.369 --> 27:32.488
Get out there and have some
clean fun, why don't you?

27:32.489 --> 27:36.338
Yeah, maybe we should
go inspect this punch.

27:36.339 --> 27:38.468
Grab a couple cups. Come on.

27:38.469 --> 27:40.298
Let's go! Let's go.

27:40.299 --> 27:42.298
["Johnny Angel" playing in background]

27:42.299 --> 27:43.419
It's going to be hard

27:43.420 --> 27:45.468
to settle the issue of what's in this...

27:45.469 --> 27:47.498
Gin or vodka?

27:47.499 --> 27:50.398
I'm sure it's a very subtle mix,

27:50.399 --> 27:52.459
so don't jump to any judgments.

27:55.459 --> 27:58.488
I'm sorry I brought up your husband.

27:58.489 --> 28:02.278
I have thin skin. It's okay.

28:02.279 --> 28:03.379
People in Texas...

28:03.380 --> 28:06.278
They're not exactly
welcoming to a divorcée.

28:06.279 --> 28:07.499
Yeah. In Maine neither.

28:07.500 --> 28:09.418
That's why I left.

28:09.419 --> 28:12.438
Hmm. You're divorced?

28:12.439 --> 28:14.449
It's different for men.

28:16.469 --> 28:18.478
Cheers.

28:18.479 --> 28:21.288
From here to eternity

28:21.289 --> 28:23.468
and to starting over.

28:23.469 --> 28:26.499
- Amen.
- Amen.

28:30.409 --> 28:32.498
- Mmm.
- Mm!

28:32.499 --> 28:35.298
That's a lot of something.

28:35.299 --> 28:36.389
So you're from Maine?

28:36.390 --> 28:38.318
Yes.

28:38.319 --> 28:40.398
It's so pretty. I visited
my cousins there.

28:40.399 --> 28:41.509
They're from Lisbon.

28:41.510 --> 28:44.328
- That's where I'm from.
- Please.

28:44.329 --> 28:46.318
- I'm not kidding.
- [laughs]

28:46.319 --> 28:47.459
I think I had the best milkshake

28:47.460 --> 28:49.338
of my life in Lisbon.

28:49.339 --> 28:51.278
How long ago were you there?

28:51.279 --> 28:52.359
Two years ago.

28:54.339 --> 28:56.329
Wow. We just missed each other.

28:58.299 --> 29:00.458
Well...

29:00.459 --> 29:02.448
to timing.

29:02.449 --> 29:04.279
To timing.

29:08.299 --> 29:09.509
It's Madison time. Hit it.

29:09.510 --> 29:12.468
All right!

29:12.469 --> 29:14.358
Whoo! Go, Jim!

29:14.359 --> 29:16.449
You're looking good. A big, strong line.

29:19.299 --> 29:22.438
When I say hit it, I want you
to go two up and two back

29:22.439 --> 29:26.299
with a big, strong turn
and back to the Madison.

29:27.319 --> 29:28.449
Hit it!

29:30.349 --> 29:32.358
Whoo!

29:32.359 --> 29:33.409
You're looking good.

29:35.389 --> 29:37.498
[dancers clap] Now, when I say hit it,

29:37.499 --> 29:39.468
I want you to go two up and two back,

29:39.469 --> 29:42.479
double cross, come out
of it with the Rifleman.

29:44.469 --> 29:46.498
- Hit it.
- Well, hey.

29:46.499 --> 29:50.328
Well, come on.

29:50.329 --> 29:53.289
Chicken? [laughs]

29:55.469 --> 29:58.289
And hold it right there. [song ends]

30:00.419 --> 30:02.438
Now here's something
from back in the day

30:02.439 --> 30:05.349
when our chaperones Mr. Amberson and Ms.
Dunhill were young.

30:08.379 --> 30:10.308
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

30:10.309 --> 30:11.459
Chicken, huh?

30:11.460 --> 30:13.449
[students whooping]

30:15.479 --> 30:18.409
- All right.
- Yeah, Mr. Amberson.

30:20.489 --> 30:22.478
How do you know how to do this?

30:22.479 --> 30:25.498
My ex-wife made me take lessons.

30:25.499 --> 30:27.449
[students snapping rhythmically]

30:29.429 --> 30:32.489
- Whoo!
- Whoo!

30:47.319 --> 30:50.279
- Whoo!
- Whoo!

30:51.329 --> 30:52.429
[students whooping]

30:54.279 --> 30:55.319
[whooping]

31:00.319 --> 31:03.339
[loud cheering]

31:06.369 --> 31:08.469
- Wow...
- We're a good team.

31:11.329 --> 31:12.359
Well...

31:15.329 --> 31:17.328
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

31:17.329 --> 31:19.388
Guess we better do some chaperoning.

31:19.389 --> 31:21.469
Okay. Right.

31:24.319 --> 31:26.398
Look, um... I...

31:26.399 --> 31:28.368
I have an emergency.

31:28.369 --> 31:30.298
An emergency?

31:30.299 --> 31:32.478
Yeah. I have to... I have to go.

31:32.479 --> 31:34.358
I will be back in one hour.

31:34.359 --> 31:36.318
- Two hours tops, okay?
- You're leaving?

31:36.319 --> 31:38.468
Yeah. I'll be back.

31:38.469 --> 31:40.468
Okay? I'll be back.

31:40.469 --> 31:45.449
[big band dance music continues]

31:48.319 --> 31:50.458
You're sure they're not gonna be here?

31:50.459 --> 31:52.439
They're staying with his mom right now.

31:54.289 --> 31:59.509
[tense music]

32:32.279 --> 32:33.338
[voices, laughter]

32:33.339 --> 32:34.348
What the hell's that?

32:34.349 --> 32:35.418
It's them! It's them!

32:35.419 --> 32:36.479
You said they were at his mom's!

32:36.480 --> 32:40.399
Come on. Finally, some privacy.

32:51.379 --> 32:54.278
[speaking Russian]

32:54.279 --> 32:55.399
[both laughing]

32:55.400 --> 32:58.318
You like?

32:58.319 --> 33:00.299
[whispers] Turn that off.

33:01.469 --> 33:03.498
I did all right, hey?

33:03.499 --> 33:05.489
Papa did all right.

33:08.449 --> 33:10.508
[speaking Russian]

33:10.509 --> 33:13.398
I-I thought... it would be

33:13.399 --> 33:15.449
a little bit nicer.

33:17.289 --> 33:18.499
You want nice?

33:18.500 --> 33:21.368
[chuckles]

33:21.369 --> 33:23.309
Well, I got nice.

33:29.419 --> 33:32.348
Oh, that's not playing fair.

33:32.349 --> 33:34.358
No.

33:34.359 --> 33:36.438
[both giggling]

33:36.439 --> 33:38.318
Wait.

33:38.319 --> 33:40.339
- Come here!
- [laughing]

33:42.339 --> 33:45.308
- I love you.
- Oh, Marina.

33:45.309 --> 33:48.488
[murmuring, kissing sounds]

33:48.489 --> 33:50.499
[laughter]

34:02.459 --> 34:05.309
[heavy breathing]

34:12.458 --> 34:18.438
[suspenseful music]

34:28.329 --> 34:29.389
[whispering] Come on.

34:29.389 --> 34:32.348
[wood creaks]

34:32.349 --> 34:33.409
Quiet.

34:50.469 --> 34:54.329
[wood creaking]

34:56.429 --> 34:59.448
- Oh! Aah! Aah!
- Shh!

34:59.449 --> 35:00.479
Aah!

35:00.480 --> 35:02.449
Who the fuck is there?

35:08.439 --> 35:10.318
Huh, you want to mess with me?

35:10.319 --> 35:11.399
Huh!

35:11.400 --> 35:13.389
[Jake and Bill thudding along floor]

35:15.489 --> 35:17.469
Come down here and face me!

35:18.509 --> 35:21.408
That's right!

35:21.409 --> 35:24.288
You run, you fucker!

35:24.289 --> 35:25.459
Now, you come back,

35:25.460 --> 35:28.328
and I will nail you to the fucking wall!

35:28.329 --> 35:29.469
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

35:29.470 --> 35:31.318
I didn't mean to scream.

35:31.319 --> 35:32.389
I just...

35:32.390 --> 35:34.369
spiders!

35:35.459 --> 35:37.418
We're getting closer to Oswald.

35:37.419 --> 35:39.478
It's the past pushing back.

35:39.479 --> 35:41.458
It felt like spiders.

35:41.459 --> 35:42.509
[click]

35:42.510 --> 35:44.508
Thieving sons of bitches.

35:44.509 --> 35:47.448
You have no right coming here!

35:47.449 --> 35:50.288
They think that they can
come into your house.

35:50.289 --> 35:52.458
- Voice activated.
- We did... we did it!

35:52.459 --> 35:54.358
- It worked!
- All right, listen.

35:54.359 --> 35:56.378
We need to get as much tape as possible.

35:56.379 --> 35:58.338
If he says anything
about General Walker,

35:58.339 --> 35:59.409
we have to hear it.

35:59.410 --> 36:02.318
I'm not in the mood, okay?

36:02.319 --> 36:04.349
I... [indistinct chatter]

36:06.339 --> 36:09.478
Give me a few, okay?

36:09.479 --> 36:11.279
Lee!

36:21.469 --> 36:23.298
Sadie.

36:23.299 --> 36:24.499
Ah, shit.

36:34.279 --> 36:36.328
Sadie, hi.

36:36.329 --> 36:37.509
I'm so sorry.

36:37.510 --> 36:39.348
For what?

36:39.349 --> 36:41.328
For leaving.

36:41.329 --> 36:43.308
Oh, did you leave?

36:43.309 --> 36:44.409
Yeah, I had no idea...

36:44.410 --> 36:46.308
Yeah, yeah. Your emergency.

36:46.309 --> 36:47.489
Things happen.

36:47.490 --> 36:49.398
Yeah.

36:49.399 --> 36:51.348
I'm sorry.

36:51.349 --> 36:54.288
All right.

36:54.289 --> 36:56.308
Good morning, Coach.

36:56.309 --> 36:59.348
You left Miss Dunhill
to chaperone alone.

36:59.349 --> 37:02.498
It was an emergency.

37:02.499 --> 37:05.308
That is very disappointing.

37:05.309 --> 37:06.419
Miss Mimi, I'm really sorry.

37:06.420 --> 37:09.448
Apologies are like dandelions, Mr.
Amberson.

37:09.449 --> 37:11.398
They're pretty enough,
and they sprout up fast,

37:11.399 --> 37:13.469
but they don't have much substance.

37:18.289 --> 37:21.318
What have I told you about
smoking in this house?

37:21.319 --> 37:24.388
We have a baby right here, Marina.

37:24.389 --> 37:27.308
I go to work all day long,
Marina, and I come back.

37:27.309 --> 37:29.369
- I would like...
- He's in a bad mood.

37:35.479 --> 37:37.348
What do you do all day, Marina?

37:37.349 --> 37:39.368
I have been changing diapers and...

37:39.369 --> 37:40.499
I never got much time with your pop

37:40.500 --> 37:42.448
before he was taken from me.

37:42.449 --> 37:44.458
I work all day long, and I come
back, and I would relax...

37:44.459 --> 37:46.398
You two should appreciate
all the time you have.

37:46.399 --> 37:49.308
We're getting nowhere. All
that guy does is complain.

37:49.309 --> 37:50.419
Comfort her. Pick her up.

37:50.420 --> 37:52.328
Why don't you do it?

37:52.329 --> 37:54.478
- [laughter]
- Where's my book?

37:54.479 --> 37:57.298
- She misunderstood.
- No, no, the other one.

37:57.299 --> 37:59.328
Understands more than you
give him credit for.

37:59.329 --> 38:00.509
This is what I can afford, Ma.

38:00.510 --> 38:03.308
[Marina giggles]

38:03.309 --> 38:04.459
I go to store, darling.

38:04.460 --> 38:06.388
- Who's defining the terms?
- Did she sleep today?

38:06.389 --> 38:08.418
Ma, can you just mind the baby?

38:08.419 --> 38:11.368
Never mind. June needs
brothers and sisters,

38:11.369 --> 38:12.489
so dress how you like.

38:14.399 --> 38:17.368
I no... slut.

38:17.369 --> 38:19.408
I did not call her that.

38:19.409 --> 38:21.388
What did you say?

38:21.389 --> 38:22.449
I told her to be careful
how she dresses.

38:22.450 --> 38:24.458
I feel for Marina. I really do.

38:24.459 --> 38:26.448
Oh, man.

38:26.449 --> 38:30.478
That night... they went
on and on and on and on

38:30.479 --> 38:32.349
about her dress.

38:34.309 --> 38:36.338
She dresses nice, you know?

38:36.339 --> 38:39.378
I mean, not like a nun, but nice.

38:39.379 --> 38:41.378
Lee's mother ought to be happy

38:41.379 --> 38:43.399
that her son's got such
a nice-looking wife.

38:45.289 --> 38:46.439
I tell you, I...

38:55.479 --> 38:58.308
Surprise! The welcome wagon is here.

38:58.309 --> 39:00.428
- Oh, my God.
- What is it?

39:00.429 --> 39:02.398
It's George.

39:02.399 --> 39:05.418
- He's CIA.
- You're shitting me?

39:05.419 --> 39:07.508
No, that's George De Mohrenschildt.

39:07.509 --> 39:09.478
I saw him in Dallas two years ago.

39:09.479 --> 39:12.368
We have to hear if
shooting General Walker

39:12.369 --> 39:14.438
is George's idea or Lee's.

39:14.439 --> 39:16.428
[speaking Russian]

39:16.429 --> 39:18.488
This might be the start
of the whole thing.

39:18.489 --> 39:22.478
[voices continue in background]

39:22.479 --> 39:24.488
But let's not leave Marina out of this.

39:24.489 --> 39:27.278
[woman speaking Russian]

39:27.279 --> 39:30.379
[man speaking Russian]

39:34.419 --> 39:39.348
[indistinct Russian chatter]

39:39.349 --> 39:43.388
Are they going to talk about Walker?

39:43.389 --> 39:46.449
If they do, then we'll know
that Lee wasn't acting alone.

39:48.339 --> 39:49.509
The English language...

39:49.510 --> 39:52.288
It remains popular in
this country, you know.

39:52.289 --> 39:53.348
Ma.

39:53.349 --> 39:54.469
She's right.

39:54.470 --> 39:57.299
What do we do if they
keep speaking Russian?

39:58.399 --> 40:01.469
[speaking Russian]

40:06.499 --> 40:09.358
Fuck! Shoot me right now.

40:09.359 --> 40:13.388
We could have spent the last two
years learning fucking Russian.

40:13.389 --> 40:15.378
I couldn't learn any Russian.

40:15.379 --> 40:17.459
[chatter in Russian continues]

40:19.359 --> 40:21.398
Should we walk?

40:21.399 --> 40:23.439
Should we follow 'em?

40:25.319 --> 40:27.478
No, they'd see us.

40:27.479 --> 40:30.328
All right, look, we need to get a
Russian-to-English dictionary.

40:30.329 --> 40:31.499
That'll get us started at least.

40:31.500 --> 40:33.468
- They make those?
- Yeah.

40:33.469 --> 40:35.498
They might have one at
the school library.

40:35.499 --> 40:37.348
I can get in there now.

40:37.349 --> 40:38.439
Look, they're going to come back.

40:38.440 --> 40:40.298
You just stay here.

40:40.299 --> 40:41.419
Make sure the tapes keep running, okay?

40:41.420 --> 40:43.279
Record it all!

40:50.299 --> 40:52.278
[door opens and closes]

40:52.279 --> 40:56.338
Hey, Bill, I got the dictionary.

40:56.339 --> 40:58.458
Bill?

40:58.459 --> 41:01.398
Bill! Hey, Bill.

41:01.399 --> 41:03.468
Bill, Bill!

41:03.469 --> 41:06.308
Hey, hey.

41:06.309 --> 41:07.339
You all right?

41:07.340 --> 41:09.368
- Ah...
- Huh?

41:09.369 --> 41:10.409
What happened?

41:10.410 --> 41:12.338
- Rafael.
- What?

41:12.339 --> 41:14.428
He and some guys pushed in here.

41:14.429 --> 41:16.308
Stole the stuff.

41:16.309 --> 41:18.348
Rafael?

41:18.349 --> 41:20.278
Fuck!

41:20.279 --> 41:23.409
I told you you shouldn't
have let him call us homos.

41:25.459 --> 41:30.298
- FBI! Hands up!
- Where's our stuff?

41:30.299 --> 41:32.378
Shit! This is all useless now.

41:32.379 --> 41:33.499
We're going to have to start all over.

41:33.500 --> 41:36.348
- No way you jotos are FBI.
- Yeah?

41:36.349 --> 41:39.458
You compromised a federal investigation!

41:39.459 --> 41:41.378
- None of this can be replaced.
- Hey...

41:41.379 --> 41:43.498
Do you want me to fuck with
you, huh, surveil you...

41:43.499 --> 41:48.298
Jake.

41:48.299 --> 41:49.479
God damn it. All right. Come on. Get up.

41:49.480 --> 41:51.428
You're helping us put it back. Let's go.

41:51.429 --> 41:53.279
Okay, okay.

41:56.309 --> 41:57.489
Let's go.

42:06.489 --> 42:08.448
Hey, let me help you.

42:08.449 --> 42:12.478
That's okay. I'm used to
doing things on my own.

42:12.479 --> 42:16.308
Right. Listen, can I make a real apology

42:16.309 --> 42:18.298
about the other night at the dance?

42:18.299 --> 42:22.358
I had no idea how rough it would
be for you to chaperone alone,

42:22.359 --> 42:25.348
and, look, I was an ass.

42:25.349 --> 42:28.438
And I-I really didn't mean
to leave the whole night.

42:28.439 --> 42:30.389
It was just a mistake.

42:33.319 --> 42:35.488
So... if there's anything I can do,

42:35.489 --> 42:39.459
I really just want to make
things right with you.

42:47.299 --> 42:50.508
- Okay.
- I like dancing with you.

42:50.509 --> 42:52.389
Me too.

42:53.509 --> 42:56.498
Take me out to dinner this weekend.

42:56.499 --> 42:59.308
Definitely. Um...

42:59.309 --> 43:00.419
Saturday.

43:01.509 --> 43:04.288
Saturday's good.

43:04.289 --> 43:06.438
Pick me up at 6:00.

43:06.439 --> 43:08.398
I'll... I'll be there.

43:08.399 --> 43:10.488
I don't see any need for
us to waste our time.

43:10.489 --> 43:12.378
Do you?

43:12.379 --> 43:13.469
Mm-mm.

43:20.499 --> 43:23.448
Oh, and, Jake...

43:23.449 --> 43:26.418
don't ever do anything
like that to me again.

43:26.419 --> 43:28.328
You left me alone with 200 kids.

43:28.329 --> 43:29.419
It was embarrassing,

43:29.420 --> 43:31.398
and I practically broke my back

43:31.399 --> 43:33.368
trying to put all those chairs away.

43:33.369 --> 43:34.459
You understand?

43:34.460 --> 43:36.478
Yes, ma'am.

43:36.479 --> 43:38.429
Good.

43:45.329 --> 43:47.418
You said that Oswald said
he was gonna be here.

43:47.419 --> 43:49.398
Yeah, I heard him tell Marina.

43:49.399 --> 43:52.508
The values our fathers died for,

43:52.509 --> 43:55.288
our grandfathers bled for,

43:55.289 --> 43:59.378
all the ideals the Sisters of
Southern Heritage stand for,

43:59.379 --> 44:02.468
are being trampled
underfoot by the Kennedys.

44:02.469 --> 44:04.288
Yes, sir! [light cheers]

44:04.289 --> 44:07.278
John and his little brother Bobby

44:07.279 --> 44:12.428
don't appreciate how the poll
tax preserves Southern culture.

44:12.429 --> 44:15.409
[cheers and applause]

44:18.469 --> 44:23.278
I'm free to name the
Civil Rights movement...

44:23.279 --> 44:24.469
- [whispers] Oswald.
- The Communist conspiracy

44:24.470 --> 44:27.328
- it is.
- He brought George.

44:27.329 --> 44:29.368
- Or George brought him.
- Yeah.

44:29.369 --> 44:30.509
And now the Kennedys...

44:30.510 --> 44:33.308
So, does the CIA want
to get the General?

44:33.309 --> 44:34.439
Want to integrate the
University of Mississippi.

44:34.440 --> 44:36.428
- [audience boos]
- I don't know.

44:36.429 --> 44:38.488
- Are we going to stop them? All: Yeah!

44:38.489 --> 44:41.408
Will you come with me to
Mississippi to stop 'em?

44:41.409 --> 44:43.318
Yes.

44:43.319 --> 44:44.509
Why would George bring him here?

44:44.510 --> 44:48.338
It's time to move. We
have talked, listened.

44:48.339 --> 44:50.328
He's baiting him, getting his blood up.

44:50.329 --> 44:52.338
And been pushed around far too much

44:52.339 --> 44:55.508
by the Antichrist Supreme Court.

44:55.509 --> 44:57.298
Rise.

44:57.299 --> 44:59.439
It's now or never!

45:04.429 --> 45:07.478
[indistinct chatter]

45:07.479 --> 45:10.398
Great speech, General.

45:10.399 --> 45:12.388
Oh, I'm glad you boys came.

45:12.389 --> 45:13.489
Yeah.

45:13.490 --> 45:15.408
Interesting. Really interesting.

45:15.409 --> 45:17.368
Oh, hey, I can introduce you.

45:17.369 --> 45:18.499
No, we got to go.

45:18.500 --> 45:20.298
- What?
- Yeah. Thank you.

45:20.299 --> 45:21.368
Okay, okay. All right, Bill.

45:21.369 --> 45:22.469
- Take care.
- Come on, Bill.

45:22.470 --> 45:24.378
General Walker?

45:24.379 --> 45:26.378
General Walker?

45:26.379 --> 45:27.499
It was great, really.

45:30.359 --> 45:32.388
Do you know what a fascist is?

45:32.389 --> 45:33.408
Sir!

45:33.409 --> 45:34.499
No, I just want to ask you.

45:34.500 --> 45:37.348
Have you ever picked up a history book,

45:37.349 --> 45:39.318
'cause Hitler would
be real proud of you!

45:39.319 --> 45:40.389
Hey, stop!

45:40.390 --> 45:42.298
- Get back!
- [grunts]

45:42.299 --> 45:44.279
- Down there.
- Right there!

45:45.509 --> 45:47.478
Racist son of a whore!

45:47.479 --> 45:49.308
[glass shatters]

45:49.309 --> 45:51.358
It was like this in Munich!

45:51.359 --> 45:52.469
- Okay!
- Get him out of here!

45:52.470 --> 45:56.289
It was like this in fucking Berlin!

45:57.469 --> 45:59.328
Okay. Okay.

45:59.329 --> 46:00.429
Okay!

46:00.430 --> 46:03.418
I told you, stay back!

46:03.419 --> 46:04.418
Calm down.

46:04.419 --> 46:05.418
[grunts]

46:05.419 --> 46:06.499
[crowd gasping]

46:06.500 --> 46:09.408
- All right.
- Aah!

46:09.409 --> 46:12.298
Go on, get!

46:12.299 --> 46:15.428
You like the General, huh?

46:15.429 --> 46:18.398
You think that the
General is a great guy?

46:18.399 --> 46:22.448
You think that that fascist
has something to say?

46:22.449 --> 46:24.478
I have something to say!

46:24.479 --> 46:28.368
I have something to say!

46:28.369 --> 46:30.438
Wake up!

46:30.439 --> 46:31.509
All right.

46:31.510 --> 46:33.318
Stay down!

46:33.319 --> 46:35.468
Wake up, you fucking fascist!

46:35.469 --> 46:39.785
Wake up, or I will kill you!
I'll fucking kill you!
