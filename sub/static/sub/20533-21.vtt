WEBVTT

00:01.919 --> 00:02.795
Previously on...

00:02.836 --> 00:04.045
You're all on
academic probation

00:04.086 --> 00:05.798
pending an investigation.

00:05.840 --> 00:07.215
You and Court are gonna
pay for this.

00:07.257 --> 00:09.092
SILVER: I watched my mom die
of breast cancer.

00:09.134 --> 00:10.302
Until I take care of this,
I feel

00:10.344 --> 00:12.053
like I'm a walking time bomb.
(sighs)

00:12.095 --> 00:14.348
I left my husband,
and I just want to press

00:14.389 --> 00:16.642
the reset button on my life
and start over.

00:16.684 --> 00:18.686
Annie, I want you
to buy the Offshore

00:18.727 --> 00:20.646
so that me and Sydney
can move to Australia.

00:20.688 --> 00:22.690
Mark's lawyer needs access
to sealed files in

00:22.731 --> 00:23.816
the D.A.'s office.

00:23.858 --> 00:25.651
The only person my mother
helps is herself.

00:25.693 --> 00:27.110
I'd be, like, making
a deal with the devil.

00:27.152 --> 00:28.737
And tell Mom I said thanks.

00:28.779 --> 00:29.571
Kiss your new girlfriend
good-bye

00:29.613 --> 00:31.657
and get on the next plane.

00:31.699 --> 00:33.742
You had a lot of great
lyrics. I just moved
things around a bit.

00:33.784 --> 00:35.243
It's exactly how I feel
about Navid.

00:35.285 --> 00:36.787
Your crush is on Navid?

00:36.829 --> 00:37.621
Yeah.

00:37.663 --> 00:40.165
Silver, I need to talk to you.

00:41.208 --> 00:42.543
Oh, my God.

00:42.584 --> 00:43.961
I can't believe you picked
Michaela.

00:44.003 --> 00:45.963
Unfortunately, her schedule

00:46.005 --> 00:48.131
just isn't going to allow it.

00:48.173 --> 00:50.885
From now on, you two
aren't living together,
you're not working

00:50.926 --> 00:52.302
together, and your
music career is over.

00:52.344 --> 00:53.762
Who the hell could have
leaked that demo?!

00:53.804 --> 00:54.889
Adrianna.

00:54.930 --> 00:56.223
Hey, your bags are gone.

00:56.264 --> 00:58.017
So is she.

01:01.061 --> 01:04.105
♪ ♪

01:08.193 --> 01:10.863
Yes. No, no, no, no.

01:10.905 --> 01:12.865
Yes, I understand how big
this is for Michaela's career.

01:12.907 --> 01:14.449
I do.

01:14.491 --> 01:15.910
No, I...

01:15.951 --> 01:18.996
Okay, um... she'll be there
tomorrow, okay?

01:19.038 --> 01:20.372
I promise.

01:21.707 --> 01:22.917
What was that?
That was
the producer

01:22.958 --> 01:24.501
from the Spencer Blane
tribute concert.

01:24.543 --> 01:26.628
He basically said, if Michaela's
not there tomorrow,

01:26.670 --> 01:28.505
I'll never work
in this town again.

01:28.547 --> 01:30.049
She's been missing for two days.

01:30.089 --> 01:31.926
We have no idea where she is.

01:31.967 --> 01:34.011
What was I supposed to say,
Silver, huh?

01:34.053 --> 01:36.137
Either way, my life is over.
I'm sorry.

01:36.179 --> 01:37.472
Your life is over?

01:37.514 --> 01:39.892
When are you gonna realize
there's more at stake here

01:39.934 --> 01:41.810
than turning Michaela
into the next Britney Spears?

01:41.852 --> 01:43.228
I do realize that.

01:43.270 --> 01:44.396
Do you? Because maybe,

01:44.438 --> 01:45.856
if you hadn't put
so much pressure on her,

01:45.898 --> 01:47.106
she wouldn't be
God knows where, doing

01:47.148 --> 01:48.776
God knows what.
Wait. I put pressure on her?

01:48.817 --> 01:50.611
What about
your birthing classes,

01:50.652 --> 01:52.529
prenatal yoga, and smelly teas?

01:52.571 --> 01:54.656
We have to fix this.
I need

01:54.698 --> 01:55.657
to call Teddy and Shane.

01:55.699 --> 01:56.909
No, Dixon! I told you.

01:56.951 --> 01:58.326
We're not doing that.

01:58.368 --> 01:59.369
What if they've already
heard from her?

01:59.411 --> 02:00.412
Then, I'm sure

02:00.454 --> 02:01.496
we would have heard from them.

02:01.538 --> 02:02.497
Teddy already thinks
I'm crazy, okay?

02:02.539 --> 02:04.207
That's why we had
to hire Michaela

02:04.249 --> 02:05.459
in the first place.

02:05.500 --> 02:09.378
If... if he thinks
I can't handle her, who knows?

02:09.420 --> 02:11.924
Maybe he'd try to move her back
to D.C. without me.

02:11.966 --> 02:14.885
Okay. Fine.
No Teddy, all right?

02:14.927 --> 02:17.262
So, what do we do?
Where do we start?

02:17.304 --> 02:19.556
Well, I set up
an alert on the credit card

02:19.598 --> 02:21.224
that I gave her to notify me if

02:21.266 --> 02:23.351
she uses it anywhere.
In the meantime,

02:23.393 --> 02:25.145
I'll print out a list
of every place

02:25.186 --> 02:26.605
she's ever used it.

02:26.647 --> 02:28.816
Let's split up
and start calling.

02:28.857 --> 02:31.318
(sighs)

02:31.359 --> 02:33.194
SYDNEY:
Honestly, I can't wait.

02:33.236 --> 02:35.614
I've always wanted to surf
Superbank in Queensland.

02:35.656 --> 02:38.283
They say you can get waves
over 200 yards easy.

02:38.325 --> 02:40.744
Then I'm gonna have
to teach you the long board.

02:40.786 --> 02:42.162
Think you can handle that?

02:42.203 --> 02:44.372
Oh, I can handle it.

02:44.414 --> 02:45.958
(clears throat)

02:46.000 --> 02:48.669
Oh, hey. I was just about
to take Syd home.

02:48.710 --> 02:50.087
SYDNEY:
Actually,

02:50.129 --> 02:52.047
you should probably drop
me off around the corner.

02:52.089 --> 02:53.632
Campbell's still at
home, and the last thing

02:53.674 --> 02:56.259
I want is for you to have
a run-in with my vindictive

02:56.301 --> 02:58.386
stepson.

02:59.763 --> 03:01.723
Annie.

03:03.100 --> 03:05.560
(sighs)

03:05.602 --> 03:07.980
My, my, what an attractive
couple they make.

03:08.022 --> 03:10.524
He calls her Syd.
She's back in his life

03:10.565 --> 03:11.942
two days,
and they're already nicknaming.

03:11.984 --> 03:13.819
It's like they're trying
to prove how close they are

03:13.861 --> 03:15.487
because they know
they're not really close at all.

03:15.529 --> 03:18.532
Mm. Cheer up.
I brought you

03:18.573 --> 03:21.409
a going-away present for
your European book tour.

03:21.451 --> 03:23.202
(laughs)

03:23.244 --> 03:25.164
Going to Paris without a
Chanel bag is like going

03:25.204 --> 03:27.082
to St. Barts without
sunscreen-- it is not healthy.

03:27.124 --> 03:28.792
You are a best-selling
American author.

03:28.834 --> 03:30.794
You have to go over there
and represent.

03:30.836 --> 03:34.840
Oh, it's not really the
Euro-snobs I'm concerned about.

03:34.882 --> 03:36.424
It's more my mother.

03:36.466 --> 03:39.720
We haven't seen each other since
she found out I wrote Undressed.

03:39.761 --> 03:41.304
Awkward.
Mm.

03:41.346 --> 03:43.765
Like, "Hey, Mom, here
promoting that book I wrote

03:43.807 --> 03:45.266
"about my life as a hooker.

03:45.308 --> 03:46.518
"Want to meet
up at Ladurée

03:46.560 --> 03:48.603
and catch up over
tea and macaroons?"

03:48.645 --> 03:50.271
Helpful.
(laughs)

03:50.313 --> 03:52.107
I am jealous you're going
to the city of romance.

03:52.149 --> 03:54.442
Makes me think of all the
naughty things I want to do

03:54.484 --> 03:56.653
with Jordan when he gets back
from his New York business trip.

03:56.695 --> 03:58.155
He got back yesterday.

03:58.197 --> 03:59.781
I went by his office
this morning

03:59.823 --> 04:01.158
to pick up my itinerary, and

04:01.200 --> 04:04.285
Amanda said he was in meetings
all day at the Beverly Grove.

04:04.327 --> 04:05.662
His mom's in town

04:05.704 --> 04:07.622
hosting some international
economic conference?

04:07.664 --> 04:10.042
Oh, that's odd... why
he wouldn't tell me,

04:10.084 --> 04:11.710
unless he wants to surprise me.

04:11.752 --> 04:13.087
That's probably it.

04:13.128 --> 04:15.005
Yeah, I think I'm just
gonna pop over there

04:15.047 --> 04:17.673
myself right now and
greet him the fun way.

04:17.716 --> 04:20.552
(both laugh)

04:22.221 --> 04:24.223
(panting and moaning)

04:24.264 --> 04:26.600
Hey, I'm so happy
we're back together.

04:26.641 --> 04:29.144
I can't believe I'm gonna
say this, but...
(laughs)

04:29.186 --> 04:31.772
I think we should stop kissing
and come up for some air.

04:31.813 --> 04:32.940
And food.

04:32.981 --> 04:36.026
Being with you is all
the air and food I need.

04:36.068 --> 04:37.318
(moaning)

04:37.360 --> 04:39.196
We've been hiding out here
with no phone,

04:39.238 --> 04:41.448
no computer, completely cut off
for two whole days.

04:41.489 --> 04:43.575
I know. Let's go
for two more.

04:43.617 --> 04:45.660
(both moaning)

04:46.954 --> 04:49.123
We need to tell our friends.

04:49.164 --> 04:51.875
I know. You're right.

04:53.001 --> 04:54.169
(both sigh)

04:54.211 --> 04:55.545
No more secrets.

04:55.587 --> 04:58.882
You think Michaela told Silver
that she walked in on us?

04:58.924 --> 05:00.968
Well, we're still
alive, so, no.

05:01.009 --> 05:03.303
All Silver cares
about is that baby.

05:03.344 --> 05:06.640
I still can't believe she won't
let Michaela sing that song

05:06.681 --> 05:09.184
at the concert.

05:09.226 --> 05:11.603
Maybe I should offer
to go on in her place,

05:11.645 --> 05:13.272
just to help Dixon.

05:13.354 --> 05:15.607
Well, it could ease
the awkward tension

05:15.649 --> 05:17.818
when I tell him that I've been
secretly sleeping

05:17.859 --> 05:18.777
with our mutual ex-girlfriend.

05:18.819 --> 05:22.363
I guess it's time. Mm.

05:23.406 --> 05:25.366
On three.

05:25.408 --> 05:27.202
One, two...

05:27.244 --> 05:30.289
(phones chiming and ringing)

05:30.330 --> 05:33.500
Oh, my God.
Michaela's missing?

05:33.541 --> 05:36.461
Yeah, Dixon says
no one's seen her for two days.

05:36.503 --> 05:39.923
Wait. Two days? That's
when she walked in on us.

05:39.965 --> 05:41.258
(sighs)

05:41.300 --> 05:44.385
Oh, so much for everyone being
happy we're back together.

05:44.427 --> 05:45.679
(sighs)

05:45.720 --> 05:47.973
(sighs)

05:52.311 --> 05:54.896
I am not the kind
of girl who can wait

05:54.938 --> 05:56.898
until Christmas morning
to unwrap her presents.

05:56.940 --> 05:59.484
Uh, Naomi, this isn't
really a great time.

05:59.526 --> 06:01.069
Oh.
ELIZABETH:
Naomi?

06:02.279 --> 06:03.446
What are you doing here?

06:03.488 --> 06:04.656
Hi, Elizabeth.

06:04.698 --> 06:08.827
Uh, Naomi, this is
Prince Harry Nagato of Japan.

06:08.869 --> 06:11.538
Your Royal Highness,
Naomi Clark.

06:11.579 --> 06:12.873
Pleasure's all mine.

06:12.914 --> 06:14.457
Harry's father is in town

06:14.499 --> 06:16.501
to discuss trade agreements
with our mother.

06:16.543 --> 06:18.295
We were just leaving.

06:18.337 --> 06:19.880
Mom wanted me
to escort Harry

06:19.921 --> 06:22.381
on a tour of the local
cultural hot spots.

06:22.423 --> 06:24.134
See you guys.

06:24.176 --> 06:26.553
I cannot believe
I just met the Prince Harry.

06:26.594 --> 06:28.347
I mean, the other Prince Harry.

06:28.387 --> 06:30.057
You know what?
Can I call you later?

06:30.098 --> 06:32.559
Uh, there's something I kind of
need to talk to you about.

06:32.600 --> 06:34.019
Family obligations?
Yeah, okay.

06:34.061 --> 06:36.188
Why don't you come
by my place later,

06:36.230 --> 06:38.106
and we will catch
up on everything?

06:38.148 --> 06:41.276
Actually, uh, Naomi,

06:41.318 --> 06:43.444
I think you're great

06:43.486 --> 06:45.989
and I've had a ton of fun,

06:46.031 --> 06:48.116
but... you know,

06:48.158 --> 06:49.826
I really just

06:49.868 --> 06:51.870
don't think things are
gonna work out between us.

06:51.912 --> 06:54.873
What? You're ending this?

06:54.915 --> 06:57.876
I never even thought
we were that serious.

06:57.918 --> 06:59.586
Oh, I see what this is.

06:59.627 --> 07:02.089
(laughs)
Wow.

07:02.130 --> 07:04.007
You're one of those guys.

07:04.049 --> 07:07.386
It's all about the chase,
you're all about the game.

07:07.426 --> 07:09.179
Well, you know what, Jordan?

07:09.221 --> 07:11.306
You're the one who loses.

07:18.146 --> 07:20.107
Oh. Hey,

07:20.148 --> 07:22.442
let me get that.
Thanks.

07:22.483 --> 07:24.903
You all packed up for
the big book tour?

07:24.945 --> 07:26.487
Yeah. Uh, my publisher says

07:26.529 --> 07:28.656
it's going to be
very big in France.

07:28.698 --> 07:30.867
Something about infidelity
and the French culture.

07:30.909 --> 07:34.204
Oh, that's great.

07:34.246 --> 07:35.580
Annie, have you,
uh, thought any more

07:35.622 --> 07:36.581
about buying
the Offshore?

07:36.623 --> 07:38.208
I know you were
looking for a way

07:38.250 --> 07:40.168
to make up for what
happened with the book.

07:40.210 --> 07:42.129
Uh, yeah, I just, um...

07:42.170 --> 07:44.131
I still need to speak
to my accountant.

07:44.172 --> 07:47.426
Just want to make sure it's not
a stupid, impulsive decision.

07:49.344 --> 07:52.513
Annie, I know you think I'm
running away like I always do,

07:52.555 --> 07:54.682
but this time
is different.

07:54.724 --> 07:57.185
With Sydney, it
just... feels right.

07:57.227 --> 07:59.438
You know, she's
like a fresh start

07:59.479 --> 08:01.564
that I've been
waiting for.

08:04.276 --> 08:06.361
I'll buy the bar.

08:06.403 --> 08:08.780
Really? Are... are you sure?

08:08.822 --> 08:10.157
Yeah, I'm sure.

08:10.198 --> 08:12.659
Um, and let's get the paperwork
going as soon as possible.

08:12.700 --> 08:14.119
Yeah.
Before I leave
for Paris.

08:14.161 --> 08:16.579
That way, by the time I'm back,
you'll be off,

08:16.621 --> 08:17.789
having your fresh start.

08:17.831 --> 08:19.458
When you know something's right,
why wait?

08:19.499 --> 08:21.626
Right.

08:25.380 --> 08:28.467
(theme music playing)

08:43.940 --> 08:46.026
Where the hell have you guys
been? I've been texting you

08:46.067 --> 08:47.319
for the last
two days.

08:47.361 --> 08:48.695
Sorry. We just heard
about Michaela.

08:48.736 --> 08:50.447
Uh, we have to
tell you something.

08:50.489 --> 08:52.907
Uh, Ade and I are,
uh... together.

08:52.949 --> 08:54.909
Like, um, together together.

08:54.951 --> 08:58.330
And a couple of days ago,
when we were at Silver's,

08:58.372 --> 09:00.957
Michaela kind of walked in
on us while we were...

09:00.999 --> 09:02.959
together together.

09:03.001 --> 09:04.503
What?!

09:04.544 --> 09:05.628
SILVER:
Oh, my God!

09:05.670 --> 09:07.005
I've been sleeping in that bed!

09:07.047 --> 09:09.590
Silver, we-we just
came to help.

09:09.632 --> 09:11.385
Oh, don't try to act all sweet
and innocent with me.

09:11.426 --> 09:14.762
I should have known-- where
there's smoke, there's you.

09:14.804 --> 09:16.431
You guys know
this looks very bad, right?

09:16.473 --> 09:18.766
Ade knew about
Michaela's crush on you,

09:18.808 --> 09:21.228
but somehow she just so happens
to walk in on you guys

09:21.269 --> 09:22.770
while you're together together?

09:22.812 --> 09:24.105
It was an accident.

09:24.147 --> 09:25.524
Ade is not out to hurt anyone.

09:25.565 --> 09:27.025
In fact, she
was gonna offer

09:27.067 --> 09:28.568
to sing the song
at the concert

09:28.609 --> 09:30.320
instead of Michaela,
just to help you out.

09:30.362 --> 09:31.446
SILVER:
Okay, so,

09:31.488 --> 09:34.115
first Adrianna secretly submits
Michaela's demo,

09:34.157 --> 09:35.616
then she scares Michaela off,

09:35.658 --> 09:38.578
and now she's offering to sing
Michaela's song in her place?!

09:38.619 --> 09:40.121
You didn't tell me
about the demo.

09:40.163 --> 09:41.956
Oh, she didn't tell you about
that. That's really convenient.

09:41.998 --> 09:42.957
No, it's not
like that.

09:42.999 --> 09:44.125
You mean, it's not like

09:44.167 --> 09:46.002
the whole Javier
situation all over again?

09:46.044 --> 09:47.670
No!
'Cause it
sure as hell

09:47.712 --> 09:49.089
seems like it.

09:49.130 --> 09:51.216
And you could forget about it,
okay? Michaela is my client.

09:51.258 --> 09:53.593
The only thing that helps me is
if she's the one who's singing.

09:53.634 --> 09:56.012
I can't believe you came to me
and said I hadn't changed,

09:56.054 --> 09:57.472
when you're the one
that's the same conniving,

09:57.514 --> 09:59.849
manipulative, backstabbing bitch
you were in high school.

09:59.891 --> 10:01.226
Silver, wait.
I thought we agreed

10:01.268 --> 10:02.977
that fighting wasn't going
to help us find Michaela.

10:03.019 --> 10:05.313
That's before I realized
everyone had their own agenda.

10:05.355 --> 10:08.191
This isn't about your career.
It's about my life.

10:08.233 --> 10:09.901
And since no one here gets that,

10:09.943 --> 10:12.237
I'm gonna go find Michaela
on my own.

10:21.204 --> 10:23.164
Hey.

10:23.206 --> 10:24.499
Hey.
Sorry. You weren't here,

10:24.541 --> 10:25.750
so I grabbed my duffle bag
out of your closet.

10:25.792 --> 10:27.043
I just need to get
a few more things.

10:27.085 --> 10:28.169
Oh, take whatever you want.

10:28.211 --> 10:29.337
After what went
down with Silver,

10:29.379 --> 10:30.547
I'm not looking for a fight.

10:30.589 --> 10:32.006
Hey, uh, you-you
going somewhere?

10:32.048 --> 10:35.218
Yeah, actually, I'm moving
to Australia with Sydney.

10:35.260 --> 10:37.429
You... you're back
with married stepmom Sydney?

10:37.471 --> 10:38.430
(laughs)

10:38.472 --> 10:39.889
Okay.

10:39.931 --> 10:41.099
I dropped off the radar
for a few days,

10:41.141 --> 10:42.183
and I missed everything.

10:42.225 --> 10:43.310
Yeah, well,
she left her husband,

10:43.351 --> 10:44.769
and we're both looking
for a change.

10:44.811 --> 10:46.229
No judgment.

10:46.271 --> 10:48.315
Um, I'll miss you, man.

10:48.356 --> 10:49.690
Yeah. I'll miss you, too.

10:49.732 --> 10:51.859
Uh, by the way,
Annie's buying the bar.

10:51.901 --> 10:54.028
Oh, okay. Sweet.

10:54.070 --> 10:55.863
Yeah. I was kind of
surprised, though. I...

10:55.905 --> 10:57.782
I mean, I gave her
the hard sell and all,

10:57.824 --> 11:00.118
but when she said yes,
it kind of felt

11:00.160 --> 11:02.162
like she was pushing me
out the door.

11:02.203 --> 11:04.164
It's probably bugging you
because you still have feelings

11:04.205 --> 11:05.457
for her.
(scoffs)

11:05.499 --> 11:06.749
High school romance.

11:06.791 --> 11:09.710
It's natural to think about
going back to it, right?

11:09.752 --> 11:12.671
Everything with Annie
was always so complicated.

11:12.713 --> 11:13.632
Yeah.

11:13.672 --> 11:15.758
I know, but, uh...

11:15.800 --> 11:19.137
people change, right?

11:19.179 --> 11:20.972
I don't think so.

11:21.014 --> 11:23.266
I mean, look at you,
you're still a loser.

11:23.308 --> 11:24.683
(chuckles)

11:25.893 --> 11:28.938
(knocks on table)

11:28.980 --> 11:32.400
(whirring)

11:32.442 --> 11:33.652
(chuckles)

11:33.692 --> 11:35.612
Uh-oh, Naomi's gone domestic.

11:35.654 --> 11:37.405
Jordan broke up with me,

11:37.447 --> 11:38.657
so I am doing
a juice cleanse

11:38.697 --> 11:41.075
to purge my mind and body
of all toxins.

11:41.117 --> 11:42.701
Well, that's one way
to deal with heartbreak.

11:42.743 --> 11:44.621
As for me, I am
buying real estate.

11:44.663 --> 11:46.747
That's why I'm
here, actually.

11:46.789 --> 11:49.209
I need some signatures,
because as of now,

11:49.250 --> 11:51.419
you'll be renting
the Offshore from me.

11:51.461 --> 11:54.088
You are not letting him go
to Australia with that hussy.

11:54.130 --> 11:55.006
(huffs)

11:55.048 --> 11:56.341
It won't last ten minutes.

11:56.383 --> 11:57.342
With the time change,

11:57.384 --> 11:58.843
they'll be broken up
before they land.

11:58.885 --> 12:00.803
All this time I've been
hoping that, on some level,

12:00.845 --> 12:01.888
Liam still has feelings for me.

12:01.929 --> 12:03.806
But the truth is,
what we had ended long ago

12:03.848 --> 12:05.350
and just because
I haven't moved on

12:05.392 --> 12:06.393
doesn't mean he hasn't.

12:06.434 --> 12:07.394
Anyway,

12:07.435 --> 12:08.936
what happened
with you and Jordan?
Well,

12:08.978 --> 12:11.565
I've had a lot
of relationships end.

12:11.606 --> 12:13.107
Okay, all of my
relationships have ended.

12:13.149 --> 12:14.526
But this was different.

12:14.568 --> 12:17.278
Jordan was acting like he never
cared about me at all.

12:17.320 --> 12:19.656
And his mother's just staring
at me with those-those

12:19.698 --> 12:21.074
judgmental eyes, and, I mean,

12:21.115 --> 12:22.909
I know that she's a judge

12:22.950 --> 12:24.827
and all that, but damn.

12:24.869 --> 12:26.705
Uh, wait.

12:26.745 --> 12:29.249
Did you say that Jordan
broke up with you

12:29.290 --> 12:31.084
in front of his mother?
Yeah.

12:31.125 --> 12:32.419
Naomi, when Mark was in jail

12:32.460 --> 12:34.837
and we needed those sealed files
from the D.A.'s office

12:34.879 --> 12:37.090
for his release, I asked Jordan

12:37.131 --> 12:38.633
to call in a favor

12:38.675 --> 12:39.551
with his mother.

12:39.593 --> 12:40.885
He implied that
he'd have to

12:40.927 --> 12:42.011
give her something in return,

12:42.053 --> 12:45.432
and I'm thinking maybe
he had to give up you.

12:45.473 --> 12:47.183
Oh, my God.

12:47.225 --> 12:48.893
Of course Jordan
was under duress.

12:48.935 --> 12:51.730
I mean, what guy in his
right mind could give up this?

12:51.770 --> 12:53.981
Well, at least your crisis
of confidence is over.

12:54.023 --> 12:55.275
(phone rings)

12:55.316 --> 12:57.944
(sighing)

12:57.985 --> 12:59.487
Hello?

12:59.529 --> 13:01.322
(Prince Harry grunting)
Naomi, it's Elizabeth.

13:01.364 --> 13:02.949
I'm in trouble
and I need your help.

13:02.990 --> 13:04.117
I can't get in touch
with Jordan,

13:04.158 --> 13:05.493
and you're the only other person

13:05.535 --> 13:06.620
I know in L.A.

13:06.661 --> 13:07.786
Whoa, Elizabeth, slow down.

13:07.828 --> 13:09.038
It's Prince Harry.

13:09.080 --> 13:10.707
We were partying and I think

13:10.749 --> 13:12.125
he took some pills or something,

13:12.166 --> 13:13.585
because he's out of control.

13:13.627 --> 13:16.045
Okay, I'm on my way,
where are you?

13:16.087 --> 13:17.088
The Beverly Grove.

13:17.130 --> 13:18.005
Elizabeth, listen to me.

13:18.047 --> 13:19.674
Lock the doors, pull the drapes,

13:19.716 --> 13:21.134
and do not speak to anyone.

13:21.175 --> 13:22.427
I will be right there.

13:23.595 --> 13:25.804
(sighs)

13:30.351 --> 13:32.979
(phone rings)

13:33.020 --> 13:34.439
(clears throat)
Hello?

13:34.481 --> 13:36.232
Erin, hi, it's Dr. Brooks.

13:36.274 --> 13:38.067
I have the results of your MRI,

13:38.109 --> 13:39.402
and it has high concerns.

13:39.444 --> 13:41.195
It's important
that we get you in here

13:41.237 --> 13:43.782
for a PET scan and a biopsy
as soon as possible.

13:43.822 --> 13:45.700
I mean, that'll
tell us everything.

13:45.742 --> 13:47.994
You mean that's gonna tell us

13:48.035 --> 13:49.454
whether or not I have cancer?

13:49.496 --> 13:51.164
We're not there yet.

13:51.205 --> 13:53.333
That's what early detection's
all about.

13:53.374 --> 13:54.709
But if there is a malignancy,

13:54.751 --> 13:57.920
then we'll move forward
with surgeries right away,

13:57.962 --> 13:59.130
just like you've planned.

13:59.172 --> 14:01.882
I want you to come in
as soon as possible, okay?

14:01.924 --> 14:03.968
Okay.

14:06.638 --> 14:08.723
(knocking)

14:17.148 --> 14:18.650
Teddy?

14:18.692 --> 14:20.527
We need to talk.

14:26.491 --> 14:27.826
(Prince Harry grunting)
Elizabeth,

14:27.867 --> 14:28.785
the door.

14:28.827 --> 14:30.203
Thank God you're here.

14:30.244 --> 14:33.164
Is anyone else
hot in here?

14:33.206 --> 14:35.333
♪ ♪

14:35.375 --> 14:36.917
Oh, God.

14:36.959 --> 14:38.670
(Naomi clears throat)

14:40.129 --> 14:41.548
You're that girl
from yesterday.

14:41.589 --> 14:42.923
Mm.

14:42.965 --> 14:44.342
Tell me something,
how much does it cost

14:44.384 --> 14:45.885
for a night
with a girl like you?

14:45.926 --> 14:48.555
That's not very
princely of you.

14:48.596 --> 14:49.681
You are so right.

14:49.723 --> 14:52.475
Please allow me to introduce you
to my friend,

14:52.517 --> 14:55.019
the royal scepter.

14:55.061 --> 14:56.103
Oh.
Oh God, no.

14:56.145 --> 14:57.355
Don't-- cover yourself.

14:57.397 --> 15:00.817
Please tell me what
happened last night.

15:00.859 --> 15:01.818
We were just
fooling around.

15:01.860 --> 15:03.110
Next thing I know,
it's 3:00 a.m.

15:03.152 --> 15:04.612
and he's dancing
naked on the balcony.

15:04.654 --> 15:06.865
That explains why
the paparazzi's swarming

15:06.906 --> 15:07.948
all over the hotel.

15:07.990 --> 15:09.325
If my name gets in the tabloids,

15:09.367 --> 15:10.660
my mom's gonna kill me.

15:10.702 --> 15:12.453
No. That is not going to happen.

15:12.495 --> 15:14.121
Your mom is not gonna
hear anything

15:14.163 --> 15:15.540
except that there was a problem,

15:15.582 --> 15:18.501
and you and I fixed it together
before anyone found out

15:18.543 --> 15:19.544
you were involved.
But

15:19.586 --> 15:20.712
how are we
gonna do that?

15:20.754 --> 15:22.797
Well, I threw a Bar Mitzvah
at this hotel

15:22.839 --> 15:24.215
a couple months ago
and I'm a great tipper.

15:24.257 --> 15:25.341
The staff will help us.

15:25.383 --> 15:27.093
Right now, we need
to make sure he doesn't get

15:27.134 --> 15:28.636
his hands on... anything else!

15:28.678 --> 15:30.096
Give me that.

15:30.137 --> 15:32.056
(grunts)
(burps)

15:32.098 --> 15:33.474
Empty the liquor
into the sink, I am gonna

15:33.516 --> 15:34.934
sweep the room
for his drug stash, okay?

15:34.975 --> 15:36.519
And you.

15:36.561 --> 15:37.687
You give me that.

15:37.729 --> 15:38.688
No. No.

15:38.730 --> 15:41.190
You need a cold shower.

15:41.232 --> 15:42.191
Go.

15:42.233 --> 15:43.234
Care to join me?

15:43.276 --> 15:45.403
Ugh.
(laughs)

15:46.654 --> 15:48.656
And don't come out
until your crown jewels

15:48.698 --> 15:51.284
smell like an English rose!

15:51.325 --> 15:53.870
Hey, so now that we're
out of the closet

15:53.912 --> 15:56.330
about dating, I taped
a 16 and Pregnant marathon

15:56.372 --> 15:57.373
for us to watch.

15:57.415 --> 15:58.625
(chuckles)

15:58.666 --> 15:59.876
I figured it would be nostalgic.

15:59.918 --> 16:00.835
(laughs)

16:00.877 --> 16:02.211
Well, I was, uh,
kind of thinking

16:02.253 --> 16:04.297
maybe we should look
for Michaela.

16:04.338 --> 16:05.715
I mean, there's
still a chance

16:05.757 --> 16:08.217
she might make the show
and sing that song, right?

16:08.259 --> 16:09.385
Yeah, I guess.

16:09.427 --> 16:11.178
Yeah, so if we look for her,
Silver won't think...

16:11.220 --> 16:13.389
Hey, I'm totally happy
looking for her.

16:13.431 --> 16:14.348
Good.

16:14.390 --> 16:15.975
But let's get one
thing straight:

16:16.016 --> 16:18.478
after everything that
Silver accused me of,

16:18.519 --> 16:20.814
I really don't care
what she thinks.

16:20.855 --> 16:23.190
(laughs)

16:23.232 --> 16:25.359
Do you?

16:25.401 --> 16:26.986
No.

16:27.027 --> 16:30.072
Uh, but, um, well, I-I mean,

16:30.114 --> 16:31.741
I get how the whole thing

16:31.783 --> 16:34.243
might seem kind of strange.

16:34.285 --> 16:35.829
Oh, my God, you agree with her?

16:35.870 --> 16:38.706
You think I was trying
to steal Michaela's song?

16:38.748 --> 16:39.999
No, I'm not saying that.

16:40.040 --> 16:41.626
I'm just saying it looks bad.

16:41.668 --> 16:42.919
You don't think I've changed.

16:42.961 --> 16:44.295
Well, Ade, you didn't tell me

16:44.337 --> 16:45.296
you leaked the song.

16:45.338 --> 16:47.047
What am I supposed
to think about that?

16:47.089 --> 16:48.466
You're supposed to believe me

16:48.508 --> 16:49.634
when nobody else does.

16:49.676 --> 16:51.469
You know why I didn't tell you

16:51.511 --> 16:52.553
about the song?

16:55.055 --> 16:57.057
You know what? Never mind.

16:57.099 --> 16:59.560
If you think that I'd
actually do something like that,

16:59.602 --> 17:00.854
it doesn't even matter.

17:02.730 --> 17:05.232
(sighs)

17:07.108 --> 17:09.319
With an all-cash offer
and no contingencies,

17:09.362 --> 17:10.946
we can be in escrow
by tomorrow.

17:10.989 --> 17:12.656
Great.
Easiest sell ever.

17:12.699 --> 17:14.032
I shouldn't even
charge a commission.

17:14.074 --> 17:15.617
(phone rings)
But don't count on it.

17:15.660 --> 17:17.161
Oh, title company.

17:17.203 --> 17:19.204
So, uh, now for the
important stuff.

17:19.246 --> 17:20.373
The sink-- it
leaks sometimes,

17:20.414 --> 17:22.040
but I'll show you
how to fix it.

17:22.082 --> 17:23.250
I think there's
a wrench

17:23.291 --> 17:25.002
around here somewhere.
(chuckles)
Thanks,

17:25.044 --> 17:27.547
but I'm pretty sure I'll get a
plumber for that sort of thing.

17:28.673 --> 17:30.967
I meant to put this
stuff in storage

17:31.009 --> 17:32.426
after it survived the fire.

17:32.468 --> 17:33.970
I don't know why I kept it.

17:34.012 --> 17:35.680
It's just a bunch of crap.

17:38.098 --> 17:40.560
Oh.

17:40.601 --> 17:43.354
I-I didn't mean to...

17:43.396 --> 17:45.398
I didn't know
this was in there.

17:45.439 --> 17:47.692
It's okay.

17:47.734 --> 17:50.403
(exhales)
It wasn't even two years ago

17:50.444 --> 17:51.612
that I proposed to you.

17:51.654 --> 17:52.906
That's crazy, huh?

17:52.947 --> 17:54.574
Yeah.

17:54.615 --> 17:56.910
Imagine how different
our lives would be if we...

17:56.951 --> 17:57.952
Yeah.

17:57.994 --> 17:59.453
(exhales)

17:59.495 --> 18:00.955
That would've been
a big mistake, though.

18:00.997 --> 18:03.708
Ah, we would've made
each other miserable.

18:03.750 --> 18:05.043
Yeah, well,

18:05.084 --> 18:07.169
we kind of ended up
doing that anyway, didn't we?

18:07.211 --> 18:08.713
Maybe not

18:08.755 --> 18:10.590
getting married was
the big mistake.

18:11.799 --> 18:14.052
(chuckles)

18:14.093 --> 18:16.721
The timing was never right
for us, was it?

18:16.763 --> 18:18.264
I mean,

18:18.305 --> 18:20.307
I-I guess I figured that if
something's meant to be,

18:20.349 --> 18:21.517
it should be easy.

18:21.559 --> 18:23.811
Yeah.
REALTOR:
There's always
a complication.

18:23.853 --> 18:25.312
This is what happens
when you don't do things right

18:25.354 --> 18:26.731
the first time.

18:26.773 --> 18:29.191
The papers from the
original sale aren't valid.

18:29.233 --> 18:31.151
The seller never signed
one of the documents.

18:31.193 --> 18:32.486
What does that mean?

18:32.528 --> 18:34.030
It means you
can't sell the bar

18:34.072 --> 18:36.074
until you get the former
owner to sign this.

18:36.115 --> 18:38.659
What kind of a grown man
calls himself Old Salty?

18:40.828 --> 18:43.372
I... All right, you know what,
I can fix this.

18:43.414 --> 18:45.416
I'll just track down Old Salty,
get him to sign the papers,

18:45.458 --> 18:46.960
and I'll get them to you
at the concert tonight.

18:47.001 --> 18:48.795
It's okay;
we'll just do it tomorrow.

18:48.836 --> 18:50.463
Actually, I can't.

18:50.504 --> 18:52.131
I got an early flight out.

18:52.172 --> 18:53.466
Syd and I leave tonight.

18:53.507 --> 18:55.093
Oh.

18:55.134 --> 18:57.136
That's-that's great.

18:57.177 --> 18:59.179
Good for you.

19:00.932 --> 19:02.266
(sighs)

19:02.308 --> 19:04.435
(quietly):
And Syd.

19:07.187 --> 19:08.314
Here you are, sir.

19:08.355 --> 19:10.108
Shocking that Michaela
hasn't spent

19:10.149 --> 19:13.152
the last 48 hours in the
student union coffee bar.

19:13.193 --> 19:14.779
She said she likes
their lattes.

19:14.821 --> 19:16.864
And it's not like you
had any better ideas.

19:16.906 --> 19:19.366
Look, Silver, I know
you're pissed at me, okay?

19:19.408 --> 19:20.660
But I had to call Teddy.

19:20.701 --> 19:21.995
After you lashed out
at everyone

19:22.036 --> 19:24.163
and went rogue in your search,
what was I supposed to do?

19:24.204 --> 19:25.581
Not go back on your word.

19:25.623 --> 19:28.084
Hey, Michaela is our
surrogate and Shane's sister.

19:28.126 --> 19:29.418
Dixon was right to call me.

19:29.460 --> 19:31.838
The question is,
why didn't you?

19:31.879 --> 19:33.255
Gee, I don't know,
maybe it's because

19:33.297 --> 19:35.049
we haven't spoken in the last
four months without fighting

19:35.091 --> 19:37.010
because you didn't even trust me
to carry my own child.

19:37.051 --> 19:39.637
Your child? See,
that's exactly why

19:39.679 --> 19:40.596
we had to hire Michaela.

19:40.638 --> 19:42.181
I'm just as much
of a parent to this child

19:42.222 --> 19:44.224
as you are, and I want
what's best for the baby.

19:44.266 --> 19:45.559
Are you kidding me?

19:45.601 --> 19:47.353
We wouldn't be in this situation
if it wasn't for you.

19:47.394 --> 19:49.730
I'm the one that's supposed
to be pregnant right now. Me.

19:49.772 --> 19:51.816
I'm sorry, Silver, but you can't
keep blaming everyone else

19:51.858 --> 19:53.609
for what's going on
in your life.

19:53.651 --> 19:56.988
If it's anyone's fault
Michaela's missing, it's yours.

19:57.947 --> 20:00.158
(phone ringing)

20:00.199 --> 20:03.327
It's a credit card alert.

20:03.369 --> 20:05.454
She just used it.

20:07.957 --> 20:11.251
At a bar.

20:13.671 --> 20:15.048
Thank you.

20:15.089 --> 20:17.383
You're welcome, ma'am.
Okay, as soon as Prince Charming

20:17.424 --> 20:18.551
sobers up,

20:18.592 --> 20:19.719
we will put him to bed,

20:19.760 --> 20:21.428
sneak you down to my
car in this trunk,

20:21.470 --> 20:23.014
and then we will be
sipping cocktails

20:23.056 --> 20:24.682
by my dipping pool in no time.

20:24.724 --> 20:26.851
Naomi, you have no idea
how grateful I am.

20:26.893 --> 20:28.561
Could you mention that
to your mother?

20:28.602 --> 20:29.979
I know she thinks

20:30.021 --> 20:31.480
I'm a total liability
to your family.

20:31.522 --> 20:33.900
You don't know what it's like
to live with that woman.

20:33.941 --> 20:36.485
The constant scrutiny
and pressure.

20:36.527 --> 20:39.279
I've really thought things
were different for Jordan,

20:39.321 --> 20:42.075
but my mom always gets
what she wants.

20:42.116 --> 20:43.367
Took her a while,

20:43.409 --> 20:45.327
but she finally got him
to be her chief of staff.

20:45.369 --> 20:46.871
Her chief of staff?

20:46.913 --> 20:48.706
Since when?
Since yesterday.

20:48.748 --> 20:50.208
No one says no to Cheryl.

20:50.249 --> 20:51.375
(thud)

20:51.417 --> 20:53.502
What the hell was that?

20:54.420 --> 20:56.089
Harry?

20:56.130 --> 20:57.798
Are you decent?

20:57.840 --> 21:00.593
I don't want another private
audience with Little Harry.

21:01.552 --> 21:03.637
We're coming in.

21:05.098 --> 21:07.058
Oh, my God.

21:11.104 --> 21:13.147
Call 911.

21:23.532 --> 21:24.992
Oh, my God,
he's dying.

21:25.034 --> 21:26.119
No, he's not dying.

21:26.160 --> 21:27.327
They checked his
vitals; he's okay.

21:27.369 --> 21:29.038
They're just gonna take
him to the hospital

21:29.080 --> 21:30.164
and pump his stomach.

21:30.206 --> 21:33.251
Hey, listen, um, Brad.

21:33.292 --> 21:34.418
Hi.

21:34.460 --> 21:36.796
We're in a bit
of a delicate situation here,

21:36.837 --> 21:38.297
and I would never tell

21:38.338 --> 21:40.800
a handsome boy like you
how to do his job,

21:40.841 --> 21:42.468
but could you possibly pull
the ambulance behind the back

21:42.509 --> 21:43.970
of the hotel and take
him down the service elevator?

21:44.011 --> 21:46.097
(chuckles)
Just stay put.

21:46.139 --> 21:48.141
The police will have
a few questions for you.

21:50.392 --> 21:51.644
Don't panic.

21:51.685 --> 21:53.062
I'm much better with cops.

21:53.104 --> 21:55.397
I don't think
that's going to help.

21:55.439 --> 21:56.649
REPORTER:
Live outside the Beverly Grove,

21:56.690 --> 21:58.151
where a source among the staff

21:58.192 --> 22:00.861
tells us the paramedics
have just been called

22:00.903 --> 22:02.321
to the room

22:02.362 --> 22:03.447
where Japan's Prince Harry

22:03.489 --> 22:05.365
was partying last night

22:05.407 --> 22:06.533
with a mystery woman.

22:06.575 --> 22:07.785
Now, we're also told...

22:07.827 --> 22:09.912
That's not good.

22:09.954 --> 22:11.705
My life is over.

22:13.332 --> 22:16.127
Mom?
Elizabeth Royce Harwood,

22:16.169 --> 22:20.256
I asked you to do
one simple thing.

22:20.298 --> 22:22.842
That was, keep Prince Harry
out of trouble.

22:22.883 --> 22:25.845
And, Naomi, I should have
known that you were here

22:25.886 --> 22:27.805
dragging my daughter
into your train wreck of a life.

22:27.847 --> 22:29.515
It's not like that.

22:29.556 --> 22:31.725
It's my fault. Prince Harry
and I came back here

22:31.767 --> 22:35.521
and he got totally out of
control, so I called Naomi.

22:35.562 --> 22:36.814
She was just
trying to help.

22:36.856 --> 22:39.150
Well, bravo, Naomi.
You really helped.

22:39.192 --> 22:41.652
If you two geniuses
had just called me earlier,

22:41.694 --> 22:43.529
I would have been able
to fix this

22:43.570 --> 22:45.698
before it turned
into an international incident.

22:45.739 --> 22:47.241
Cheryl, I'm sorry...
The only bright side

22:47.283 --> 22:49.827
to this is, now we both know

22:49.869 --> 22:53.331
how much better off Jordan
is without you.

22:54.748 --> 22:56.917
Mm!
(sighs)

23:03.465 --> 23:05.551
Yo.
Hey, Salty.

23:05.592 --> 23:07.636
Love what you've done
with the place.

23:07.678 --> 23:09.096
Really?

23:09.138 --> 23:10.514
No, I was just being polite.

23:10.556 --> 23:12.183
Actually, I think
you went a little crazy

23:12.225 --> 23:13.351
with the gray paint, huh?
(laughs)

23:13.391 --> 23:15.061
(chuckles)
So...

23:15.102 --> 23:16.687
you're selling already?

23:16.729 --> 23:19.148
Yeah. Yeah, it's time
for me to move on.

23:19.190 --> 23:21.567
This is the only thing
keeping me in L.A.

23:21.608 --> 23:23.694
You kids these days,
you don't stay put long enough

23:23.736 --> 23:25.279
to grow a 5:00 shadow.

23:25.321 --> 23:27.240
The Facebook, that Twitter.

23:27.281 --> 23:29.533
It's shortened
your attention span.

23:29.575 --> 23:31.535
Yeah. Yeah, I guess
you're right. (chuckles)

23:31.577 --> 23:34.288
Uh, anyway, it turns out
we didn't get your signature

23:34.330 --> 23:36.582
on a few things.
Well, I'm not surprised.

23:36.623 --> 23:39.085
You were pretty loaded
that night.

23:39.126 --> 23:42.546
You kept going on and on
about two girls in your life.

23:42.588 --> 23:46.259
Yeah. I guess I did.
(chuckles)

23:46.300 --> 23:47.885
So, how'd that
work out for you?

23:47.927 --> 23:48.802
They still around?

23:48.844 --> 23:51.764
One of 'em is.

23:51.805 --> 23:53.933
She always is.

23:53.974 --> 23:56.643
Wow. If she's still around
after all this time,

23:56.685 --> 23:58.104
she must be pretty special.

23:58.145 --> 24:00.356
Yeah.

24:00.398 --> 24:02.316
You know, it's funny. You kept
saying you were buying this bar

24:02.358 --> 24:05.569
to escape your past,
make sure you never went back.

24:05.611 --> 24:07.571
A crazy reason to buy a bar.

24:07.613 --> 24:08.822
To escape.

24:08.864 --> 24:10.157
Too much damn work.

24:10.199 --> 24:11.617
You're right about that.

24:11.658 --> 24:14.120
Yeah, running this place
has been hard as hell.

24:14.161 --> 24:16.080
But was it worth it?

24:18.749 --> 24:21.419
Yeah, it was.

24:21.459 --> 24:24.338
Well, there you go.

24:24.380 --> 24:26.215
(chuckles)
Good luck, kid.

24:26.257 --> 24:29.509
Thanks.
You know, maybe
you weren't

24:29.551 --> 24:31.262
trying to escape after all.

24:31.304 --> 24:33.347
Maybe there's a little part
of you that knew

24:33.389 --> 24:35.099
that the best things in life

24:35.141 --> 24:38.269
don't always
come easy.

24:41.397 --> 24:43.274
WOMAN:
This isn't the first time

24:43.316 --> 24:46.152
Prince Harry has found himself
at the center of scandal.

24:46.193 --> 24:49.405
It was just last year
when customs agents discovered

24:49.447 --> 24:53.909
two grams of cocaine on his
yacht off the coast of Mykonos.

24:56.912 --> 24:59.123
Can I buy you a drink?
I don't know.

24:59.165 --> 25:02.126
I don't want your mom
to lose her mind.

25:02.168 --> 25:05.421
Actually, on second thought...

25:05.463 --> 25:07.840
(sighs)
Look, I heard
about what happened,

25:07.881 --> 25:10.843
but what I don't get is
why you helped my sister

25:10.884 --> 25:13.220
after the way I treated you.
Annie told me

25:13.262 --> 25:15.097
how she pressured you
into asking your mom

25:15.139 --> 25:17.057
for help with Mark.

25:17.099 --> 25:19.393
In exchange,
you had to...

25:19.435 --> 25:21.687
stop seeing me,
I presume?

25:21.728 --> 25:25.024
I wanted to tell you the truth
earlier, and I'm sorry.

25:25.065 --> 25:28.194
(sighs)
I wanted so badly just
to prove to your mom

25:28.235 --> 25:31.238
that I wasn't the liability
she thinks I am.

25:31.280 --> 25:33.991
I thought somehow
that would help fix everything.

25:34.033 --> 25:36.118
Apparently,
that wasn't the case.

25:36.160 --> 25:38.536
But there's one thing
I don't understand.

25:38.578 --> 25:41.207
How did she get you to agree
to be her chief of staff?

25:41.248 --> 25:44.084
I mean, I know that she unsealed
those files for my brother,

25:44.126 --> 25:47.587
but... why would you give up
so much for such a small favor?

25:47.629 --> 25:50.883
It wasn't a small favor.

25:50.924 --> 25:52.510
Uh...
(sighs)

25:52.550 --> 25:55.553
Look, my mother
did have Mark's files unsealed,

25:55.595 --> 25:56.680
but there wasn't enough

25:56.722 --> 25:57.806
in them to have
him cleared.

25:57.848 --> 25:59.266
But Mark was innocent.
Yeah,

25:59.308 --> 26:01.768
of course he was,
but there wasn't any proof.

26:01.810 --> 26:04.313
Jordan, what did your mom do?

26:04.355 --> 26:07.107
Uh...

26:07.149 --> 26:11.070
Let's... let's just say
she handled it.

26:11.111 --> 26:14.073
And she agreed
to make it happen if I'd give up

26:14.114 --> 26:16.492
the publishing company
and come back into the fold.

26:16.534 --> 26:20.829
I cannot let you give up
your whole life's work for me.

26:20.871 --> 26:22.206
What's done
is done.

26:22.248 --> 26:25.667
I'm really just happy
that your brother's okay.

26:25.709 --> 26:27.669
Now, if you'll excuse me,

26:27.711 --> 26:31.549
my mother is about to have
a press conference.

26:31.589 --> 26:33.926
And unfortunately,
it is my job to be there.

26:47.647 --> 26:49.816
Michaela.

26:50.984 --> 26:52.610
Thank God.

26:52.652 --> 26:54.280
Teddy, what are you doing here?

26:54.321 --> 26:56.240
Shane and I were worried.
I'm sorry,

26:56.282 --> 26:57.366
I wasn't trying
to scare you.

26:57.408 --> 26:58.367
I just needed time.

26:58.409 --> 27:00.660
We understand.

27:00.702 --> 27:03.122
Look, I know Adrianna got
in your head.

27:03.163 --> 27:04.498
It's happened to the best of us.

27:04.540 --> 27:08.001
No, it has nothing
to do with Ade.

27:08.043 --> 27:10.796
I was working up the courage
to come find you.

27:10.837 --> 27:12.256
That's why I was
having this drink.

27:12.298 --> 27:14.174
Silver, I know
how important

27:14.216 --> 27:16.385
this baby
is to you.

27:18.387 --> 27:20.556
Which is why I
couldn't tell you

27:20.598 --> 27:23.225
the day I went
to the doctor.

27:25.102 --> 27:26.937
When I went,
there wasn't a heartbeat.

27:28.230 --> 27:30.149
It was just gone.

27:30.190 --> 27:31.525
Oh, my God...

27:31.567 --> 27:33.444
He said that
there's nothing

27:33.486 --> 27:35.070
we could've done,
sometimes it just happens.

27:35.112 --> 27:36.822
(sobs)
Silver,

27:36.863 --> 27:38.865
I'm so sorry.

27:42.953 --> 27:44.997
(sighs)

28:01.221 --> 28:03.307
♪ ♪

28:06.018 --> 28:07.811
Hey-ey-ey, Liam.

28:07.853 --> 28:09.855
Hey, I know you're leaving
after the concert.

28:09.896 --> 28:12.608
Look who just saved you a trip
back to the Offshore.

28:12.650 --> 28:13.526
Thanks, man.

28:13.567 --> 28:15.027
You left
your bag?

28:15.068 --> 28:17.363
Yeah, my friend here is a man
of few possessions,

28:17.404 --> 28:20.366
uh, few emotions,
and, uh, even fewer words.

28:20.407 --> 28:21.450
(sighs) Thanks.

28:25.120 --> 28:26.288
Hey, guys, check it out.

28:26.330 --> 28:28.165
Let's get hammered.
Nice.

28:28.207 --> 28:29.375
Nice.

28:29.416 --> 28:32.002
I figured we could grill up
some brats, too, man.

28:32.044 --> 28:33.629
Dude, you can't bring
a camp grill in here.

28:33.671 --> 28:34.672
Are you high?

28:34.712 --> 28:36.382
Yeah, man, I am.

28:36.423 --> 28:38.258
Put it away.

28:38.300 --> 28:39.593
Geez.

28:39.635 --> 28:43.347
Well, well, if it isn't
Beverly Hills' own

28:43.389 --> 28:45.307
caped crusaders.

28:45.349 --> 28:47.601
Uh... am I Batman or Robin?

28:47.643 --> 28:49.978
Do you even have
to ask that?

28:50.020 --> 28:51.397
What the hell are you
doing here, Campbell?

28:51.438 --> 28:52.606
Just because
I got expelled

28:52.648 --> 28:54.608
and my dad's cheating
bitch of a wife--

28:54.650 --> 28:56.485
oh, hey, Sydney--
is running off to
Australia with you

28:56.527 --> 28:58.362
doesn't mean I can't
go to a concert.

28:58.404 --> 28:59.821
Sorry about all that.
Mm.

28:59.863 --> 29:01.907
My only regret is that I
didn't get to personally kick

29:01.948 --> 29:02.908
your ass out of school.

29:02.949 --> 29:04.034
Yeah?

29:04.076 --> 29:07.079
(laughs) You want to
take this outside?

29:07.120 --> 29:08.830
Trust me, there's
nothing I'd love more.

29:10.416 --> 29:12.376
(scoffs)
Whatever.

29:12.418 --> 29:15.837
Yeah, you're
definitely Batman.

29:17.172 --> 29:18.757
You're Liam Court.

29:18.798 --> 29:19.841
Yeah.

29:19.883 --> 29:21.594
You got backstage passes.

29:21.635 --> 29:24.137
You don't have to go
through security.
Okay, sweet.

29:25.431 --> 29:27.015
(sighs)
Unbelievable.

29:27.057 --> 29:28.100
LIAM:
Thanks.

29:28.141 --> 29:29.309
This show's gonna be dope, man.

29:29.351 --> 29:31.687
I hear they're gonna have
fireworks.

29:31.729 --> 29:34.814
Sometimes it is like
you are eight years old.

29:46.368 --> 29:48.495
I put this baby
ahead of everything.

29:50.372 --> 29:54.376
I made it the most important
thing in my life.

29:54.418 --> 29:56.503
I let it come between us.

29:59.881 --> 30:02.884
And now it's just... gone.

30:06.012 --> 30:08.474
I'm so sorry.

30:08.515 --> 30:09.933
No.

30:09.975 --> 30:12.185
Silver, I'm the one
who's sorry.

30:14.605 --> 30:17.065
I've spent the past four months
fighting with you,

30:17.107 --> 30:19.318
just trying to prove
that I'm as much of a parent

30:19.359 --> 30:20.569
to this child as you are.

30:20.611 --> 30:22.237
But in that moment,

30:22.279 --> 30:24.156
when Michaela told us
the news...

30:24.197 --> 30:26.575
I looked at you, and it was
like watching someone

30:26.617 --> 30:27.951
break in half.

30:27.993 --> 30:29.953
As awful

30:29.995 --> 30:31.455
as I felt, I realized

30:31.497 --> 30:34.207
I couldn't really understand

30:34.249 --> 30:35.751
what it must be
like for you.

30:37.753 --> 30:39.879
I should've let you carry
the baby, Silver.

30:39.921 --> 30:42.132
It might've made
a difference.

30:43.883 --> 30:47.429
I never had the right to take
that away from you.

30:47.471 --> 30:49.473
S-Silver, do you think
there's any way

30:49.515 --> 30:51.725
we're ever gonna be able
to get past this?

30:54.936 --> 30:57.063
I honestly don't know.

30:59.316 --> 31:01.360
But I do know
there's no one else

31:01.401 --> 31:03.278
I would rather have
hold me right now.

31:07.324 --> 31:08.908
(sobs)

31:08.950 --> 31:10.994
(crying quietly)

31:16.291 --> 31:19.294
Due to Prince Harry's
unexpected reaction

31:19.336 --> 31:20.629
to his allergy medication,

31:20.671 --> 31:23.549
the Nagatos have asked
to postpone our trade talks.

31:23.590 --> 31:26.635
Isn't it true that
the Nagato family has refused

31:26.677 --> 31:27.886
to go back
to the table with you?

31:27.927 --> 31:29.929
Their emotions are
understandably heightened.

31:29.971 --> 31:30.889
What do you say
to reports

31:30.930 --> 31:32.641
that the prince
actually overdosed,

31:32.683 --> 31:35.185
and that "mystery woman" he was
partying with last night

31:35.227 --> 31:37.062
was your own daughter,
Elizabeth?

31:37.103 --> 31:39.272
I hate to even justify that
with a response.

31:39.314 --> 31:40.816
Well, if it wasn't
your daughter,

31:40.858 --> 31:42.693
then whose voice is
on the 911 tape?

31:44.903 --> 31:47.447
It's Elizabeth's voice.

31:49.366 --> 31:52.411
Harry and I were partying
last night.

31:52.452 --> 31:53.704
It got out of control,

31:53.746 --> 31:55.539
and I didn't know what to do,
so I called Elizabeth.

31:55.581 --> 31:57.207
When she arrived,

31:57.249 --> 31:59.501
we found the prince passed out
in the bathroom.

31:59.543 --> 32:02.295
I froze, but Elizabeth handled
it like a pro,

32:02.337 --> 32:06.007
called 911,
and she saved Harry's life.

32:06.049 --> 32:07.384
And who exactly are you?

32:07.426 --> 32:08.594
I'm Naomi Clark.

32:08.635 --> 32:09.928
Your mystery woman.
REPORTER 2:
Ms. Clark,

32:09.969 --> 32:11.388
what is your relationship
to the prince?
Naomi!

32:11.430 --> 32:12.931
What was the prince
taking before
paramedics showed up?

32:12.972 --> 32:14.182
REPORTER 3:
How long have you known
the prince?

32:17.644 --> 32:19.396
(knocking)

32:19.438 --> 32:21.147
Hey.

32:21.189 --> 32:22.148
Hey.

32:22.190 --> 32:25.277
I'm sorry about the concert.

32:25.318 --> 32:27.195
I feel like
I kind of let everybody down.

32:27.237 --> 32:28.530
Don't say that.

32:28.572 --> 32:30.407
I just want to make
sure you're okay.

32:30.449 --> 32:32.242
If there's anything
I can do to help...

32:32.284 --> 32:34.119
Thanks.

32:34.160 --> 32:36.329
Although I think right now
the best thing is for me

32:36.371 --> 32:39.082
just to go back to D.C.
and be with my family.

32:39.124 --> 32:41.501
I get it.

32:41.543 --> 32:44.212
Hey, uh... if you ever want
to be a rock star,

32:44.254 --> 32:46.757
you know where to find me.

32:46.799 --> 32:49.008
Unless, of course, that producer
really wants to kill me.

32:49.050 --> 32:51.970
Well, if you need someone
to sing that song tonight,

32:52.011 --> 32:53.806
you should ask Ade.

32:53.847 --> 32:55.933
No, I'm not doing Adrianna
any favors.

32:55.974 --> 32:57.851
She tried to steal your song.

32:57.893 --> 32:59.728
Dixon... no.

32:59.770 --> 33:02.105
Ade wasn't trying
to steal my song.

33:03.231 --> 33:05.275
She couldn't have.

33:05.317 --> 33:07.569
She wrote it.

33:11.156 --> 33:12.365
(applause and cheering)

33:12.407 --> 33:14.409
Good evening.
I'm Jason Kennedy.

33:14.451 --> 33:17.245

for a musical tribute

33:17.287 --> 33:20.206

to finish setting up the
pyrotechnics for the finale.

34:30.402 --> 34:32.445
You got it.

34:33.864 --> 34:35.447
LIAM:
Hey.
Did you find Old Salty?

34:35.489 --> 34:38.368
Actually,

34:38.409 --> 34:40.746
I wanted to talk
to you about that.

34:40.786 --> 34:42.789
Oh, hey, Annie.

34:45.123 --> 34:47.793
You were saying?

34:47.835 --> 34:49.880
Um... well, I...

34:51.380 --> 34:53.341
About Old Salty-- I...

34:53.382 --> 34:55.301
I couldn't find him.

34:55.342 --> 34:57.136
Really?

34:57.178 --> 34:59.765
Yeah. I, uh...

34:59.806 --> 35:02.684
So, I-I don't
have a signature,

35:02.726 --> 35:05.979
which means we can't move
to Australia... yet.

35:06.021 --> 35:08.314
Sorry, Syd.

35:08.356 --> 35:10.275
So, that's it?

35:10.316 --> 35:13.904
You're not going just because
you couldn't get the signature?

35:13.946 --> 35:16.740
That's the only reason?

35:18.700 --> 35:21.202
Mm-hmm, yeah.

35:22.161 --> 35:25.373
Fine. Well, have a great life.

35:30.420 --> 35:32.631
Come on, let's
get out of here.

35:41.473 --> 35:43.433
Dixon, this is insane.

35:43.475 --> 35:45.060
I haven't even rehearsed.

35:45.102 --> 35:46.436
You don't have
to rehearse.

35:46.478 --> 35:48.229
It's your song.
You know it.

35:48.271 --> 35:50.398
Okay, well, even
if I could get ready in time,

35:50.440 --> 35:52.191
everyone's gonna think
I just stole it from Michaela.

35:52.233 --> 35:54.360
No, they won't, because
I'll tell them the truth.

35:54.402 --> 35:56.362
Look, after everything
that I've said,

35:56.404 --> 35:58.281
you have every right
to say no, okay?

35:58.323 --> 36:00.492
But, please, this
will save my ass.

36:00.533 --> 36:02.661
Plus, you deserve it.

36:02.702 --> 36:04.121
Get me to makeup.

36:04.162 --> 36:05.413
Really?
Mm-hmm.

36:05.455 --> 36:07.707
Let's go.
(laughs)

36:12.045 --> 36:13.797
That was quite a stunt
you pulled

36:13.839 --> 36:15.214
at the press conference.

36:15.256 --> 36:17.175
It was reckless, irresponsible,

36:17.216 --> 36:19.344
and it could have backfired.

36:19.385 --> 36:20.345
But it didn't.

36:20.386 --> 36:22.097
Why'd you do it?
Because I know

36:22.139 --> 36:24.683
you're holding what you did for
my brother over Jordan's head,

36:24.724 --> 36:25.892
and I return my own favors.

36:25.934 --> 36:27.352
I will keep
Elizabeth's

36:27.393 --> 36:30.229
reputation intact, but I want
you to do something for me.

36:30.271 --> 36:31.731
(laughing)

36:31.773 --> 36:34.317
If you think I'm going
to let you date Jordan...

36:34.359 --> 36:36.736
I don't. I know
you'll never let that happen,

36:36.778 --> 36:39.572
especially not now that I'm
the Drug Whore of Beverly Hills.

36:39.614 --> 36:42.034
I want you to give
Jordan his life back.

36:42.075 --> 36:43.702
He goes back to his company.

36:43.743 --> 36:45.704
He is no longer
your chief of staff.

36:45.745 --> 36:47.789
And if I don't agree?

36:47.831 --> 36:49.666
Then I will tell everyone
I lied,

36:49.708 --> 36:51.043
and Elizabeth will take
the fall.

36:51.084 --> 36:52.836
You're bluffing.

36:52.878 --> 36:56.882
Maybe I am, maybe I'm not.

36:56.923 --> 36:58.299
Fine.

36:58.341 --> 37:00.593
I will announce Jordan's

37:00.635 --> 37:03.262
departure from my staff
effective immediately.

37:04.806 --> 37:08.393
I have to admit...
I was wrong about you, Naomi.

37:08.434 --> 37:12.313
You're a lot smarter
than I gave you credit for.

37:14.149 --> 37:16.068
KENNEDY:
And now we have

37:16.109 --> 37:17.736

surprise guest tonight.
