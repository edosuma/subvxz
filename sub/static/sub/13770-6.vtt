There. That's it.

01:07.150 --> 01:09.486
I made your bed

01:07.150 --> 01:09.486
every day for a year.

01:09.528 --> 01:12.322
Wow. Congratulations. I can't

01:09.528 --> 01:12.322
believe you actually did it.

01:12.364 --> 01:14.992
According to our deal,

01:12.364 --> 01:14.992
that means from now on

01:15.034 --> 01:16.493
I get to sleep in this bed.

01:16.535 --> 01:18.286
That wasn't exactly

01:16.535 --> 01:18.286
our deal, Dewey.

01:18.328 --> 01:20.372
Yes, it was. You promised

01:18.328 --> 01:20.372
that if I did it,

01:20.414 --> 01:23.124
I'd get the bed

01:20.414 --> 01:23.124
every day after that.

01:23.166 --> 01:25.002
Right. Every  day,

01:25.044 --> 01:26.336
but I still

01:25.044 --> 01:26.336
get it at night.

01:26.378 --> 01:27.379
That's not fair!

01:27.421 --> 01:28.714
I don't know, Dewey.

01:28.756 --> 01:30.131
His case sounds

01:28.756 --> 01:30.131
pretty solid to me.

01:30.173 --> 01:31.550
REESE:

01:30.173 --> 01:31.550
Oh, and, Dewey,

01:31.592 --> 01:34.011
I don't want to ruin it

01:31.592 --> 01:34.011
by being too specific,

01:34.053 --> 01:37.096
but something you wear now has

01:34.053 --> 01:37.096
some kind of creature in it.

01:39.349 --> 01:41.142
Jamie's making

01:39.349 --> 01:41.142
such strides.

01:41.184 --> 01:43.520
He's so in touch

01:41.184 --> 01:43.520
with his emotions.

01:43.562 --> 01:45.731
I wish I could be

01:43.562 --> 01:45.731
more like that

01:45.773 --> 01:47.983
and just cry for

01:45.773 --> 01:47.983
hours and hours.

01:48.025 --> 01:49.192
Oh, here's the flyer

01:49.234 --> 01:51.528
for the "daddy and child" class

01:49.234 --> 01:51.528
I'll be teaching

01:51.570 --> 01:52.780
at the rec center.

01:52.821 --> 01:53.822
Polly, this is

01:53.864 --> 01:55.532
the fifth flyer you've given me.

01:55.574 --> 01:57.158
I'm sorry, I was

01:55.574 --> 01:57.158
just so excited.

01:57.200 --> 02:00.161
It was such a revelation to me

01:57.200 --> 02:00.161
that I should be teaching.

02:00.203 --> 02:01.162
I've always tried

02:01.204 --> 02:03.164
to follow my bliss,

02:01.204 --> 02:03.164
but up until now

02:03.206 --> 02:04.959
my blisses have turned out to be

02:05.000 --> 02:06.752
treacherous

02:05.000 --> 02:06.752
and self-destructive.

02:06.794 --> 02:07.795
Can't wait.

02:08.378 --> 02:09.379
Do I really have to...

02:09.421 --> 02:11.131
Yes, Hal.

02:12.883 --> 02:14.551
Boys, I wanted

02:12.883 --> 02:14.551
to talk to you.

02:14.593 --> 02:16.595
I've got some good news.

02:14.593 --> 02:16.595
I've been thinking.

02:16.637 --> 02:18.013
You're both growing up.

02:18.055 --> 02:20.181
You're showing a lot

02:18.055 --> 02:20.181
more maturity these days.

02:20.223 --> 02:21.433
I think you've

02:20.223 --> 02:21.433
earned the right

02:21.475 --> 02:23.184
to a little bit

02:21.475 --> 02:23.184
more independence.

02:23.226 --> 02:24.603
We're getting a car!

02:24.645 --> 02:26.021
You're both getting jobs.

02:26.063 --> 02:27.230
What?

02:27.272 --> 02:29.775
Malcolm, I talked to the manager

02:27.272 --> 02:29.775
of the Lucky Aide this morning.

02:29.817 --> 02:30.776
You start there tomorrow.

02:30.818 --> 02:31.819
You want me to work

02:31.860 --> 02:33.194
at your store? With you?

02:33.236 --> 02:35.363
Yes. Reese-- since you've

02:33.236 --> 02:35.363
been mentioned six times

02:35.405 --> 02:36.865
by name

02:35.405 --> 02:36.865
in the security handbook,

02:36.907 --> 02:38.659
you have to look

02:36.907 --> 02:38.659
for a job somewhere else,

02:38.700 --> 02:41.202
but I want you in a paper hat

02:38.700 --> 02:41.202
by the end of the week.

02:41.244 --> 02:42.579
Please don't

02:41.244 --> 02:42.579
do this to me.

02:42.621 --> 02:44.039
Just let me find my own job.

02:44.081 --> 02:45.373
Malcolm, it's already done.

02:45.415 --> 02:46.416
I had to call in

02:46.458 --> 02:48.209
a lot of favors

02:46.458 --> 02:48.209
with Mr. Young for you.

02:48.251 --> 02:50.004
You are not going

02:48.251 --> 02:50.004
to make  me  look bad

02:50.045 --> 02:51.421
by not honoring

02:50.045 --> 02:51.421
your  commitments.

02:51.463 --> 02:53.214
How is it my commitment?!

02:53.256 --> 02:56.093
Because I'm your mother and

02:53.256 --> 02:56.093
you're doing it. That's final.

02:56.135 --> 02:57.636
I was thinking there's a lot

02:56.135 --> 02:57.636
of germs flying around.

02:57.678 --> 02:59.220
Dad, Mom has this stupid

02:57.678 --> 02:59.220
idea about working...

02:59.262 --> 03:00.430
Huh! Huh! Huh!

02:59.262 --> 03:00.430
That's enough!

03:00.472 --> 03:01.598
You boys heard your mother.

03:01.640 --> 03:02.808
We have always said

03:02.850 --> 03:04.810
you have to concentrate

03:02.850 --> 03:04.810
on your schoolwork

03:04.852 --> 03:06.812
before wasting your time

03:04.852 --> 03:06.812
on dead-end jobs.

03:06.854 --> 03:08.856
You have got your

03:06.854 --> 03:08.856
whole life to work

03:08.897 --> 03:10.607
and only one chance to learn.

03:10.649 --> 03:12.400
I told them to

03:10.649 --> 03:12.400
get jobs, Hal.

03:12.442 --> 03:14.069
The value

03:12.442 --> 03:14.069
of hard work.

03:14.111 --> 03:16.237
Money doesn't

03:14.111 --> 03:16.237
grow on trees.

03:16.279 --> 03:18.197
The sooner you two kids

03:16.279 --> 03:18.197
have jobs, the better.

03:21.451 --> 03:24.245
My first paycheck,

03:21.451 --> 03:24.245
I'm buying this house

03:24.287 --> 03:25.873
and kicking them out.

03:25.914 --> 03:29.250
As we emerge

03:25.914 --> 03:29.250
from the cocoon of self-doubt...

03:29.292 --> 03:33.839
reaching

03:29.292 --> 03:33.839
for unconditional affirmation...

03:33.881 --> 03:36.257
defeating our inner critics.

03:36.299 --> 03:38.677
And rest.

03:38.719 --> 03:41.055
See, daddies can be just

03:38.719 --> 03:41.055
as good mommies as mommies.

03:41.096 --> 03:42.263
(watch beeps)

03:42.305 --> 03:44.432
Oh! I have to make

03:42.305 --> 03:44.432
a quick phone call

03:44.474 --> 03:45.893
to the parole officer.

03:45.934 --> 03:47.435
Oh, don't worry,

03:45.934 --> 03:47.435
it's not about me.

03:47.477 --> 03:49.646
It's about one of my dads,

03:47.477 --> 03:49.646
but while I'm gone,

03:49.688 --> 03:52.440
why don't you do that

03:49.688 --> 03:52.440
"baby-ssage" thing I showed you.

03:52.482 --> 03:54.985
You know,

03:52.482 --> 03:54.985
babies feel stress, too.

03:56.570 --> 03:59.740
(all sighing, groaning)

03:59.781 --> 04:03.077
Man, I'm so bored I can

03:59.781 --> 04:03.077
feel my own hair growing.

04:03.118 --> 04:04.912
Maybe I should wait a couple

04:03.118 --> 04:04.912
years to bond with Jamie.

04:04.953 --> 04:07.288
It's got to be easier

04:04.953 --> 04:07.288
when he can do more than

04:07.330 --> 04:08.749
just burble

04:07.330 --> 04:08.749
and sit up.

04:08.790 --> 04:09.958
Your baby can sit up?

04:10.000 --> 04:11.085
For how long?

04:11.126 --> 04:12.920
I don't know.

04:11.126 --> 04:12.920
Ten seconds?

04:12.961 --> 04:14.462
My baby can sit

04:12.961 --> 04:14.462
up for 20.

04:14.504 --> 04:16.757
Jasmine can

04:14.504 --> 04:16.757
do it for 30.

04:16.798 --> 04:18.299
Oh, yeah?

04:18.341 --> 04:20.094
Do it, Jamie. Come on,

04:18.341 --> 04:20.094
buddy, you can do it!

04:20.135 --> 04:21.302
Do it for Daddy.

04:21.344 --> 04:22.303
Do it for Daddy.

04:22.345 --> 04:23.889
Stay up. Stay up. Stay up.

04:23.931 --> 04:24.890
One more. One more.

04:24.932 --> 04:26.307
Come on, baby. Come on, baby.

04:26.349 --> 04:27.559
Come on, baby,

04:26.349 --> 04:27.559
you can...

04:27.601 --> 04:29.310
(shrieks):

04:27.601 --> 04:29.310
Yes! Way to go, Jamie.

04:29.352 --> 04:31.939
I think this belongs to me.

04:31.980 --> 04:33.314
(door opening)

04:39.362 --> 04:41.322
Hello, you've reached

04:39.362 --> 04:41.322
The Grotto. Please hold.

04:41.364 --> 04:43.742
Hello, you've reached

04:41.364 --> 04:43.742
The Grotto. Please hold.

04:43.784 --> 04:45.744
(phone ringing)

04:45.786 --> 04:47.328
Hello, you've reached

04:45.786 --> 04:47.328
The Grotto.

04:47.370 --> 04:49.330
You are a terrible brother!

04:49.372 --> 04:50.999
Dewey?

04:49.372 --> 04:50.999
Malcolm and Reese do nothing

04:51.041 --> 04:52.333
but torture me all day long.

04:52.375 --> 04:54.211
My life is horrible

04:52.375 --> 04:54.211
and it's not fair!

04:54.253 --> 04:55.754
Dewey, you're not

04:54.253 --> 04:55.754
making any sense.

04:55.796 --> 04:58.132
You were nice

04:55.796 --> 04:58.132
to Malcolm and Reese

04:58.173 --> 05:00.383
but then you got kicked out

04:58.173 --> 05:00.383
before I was even old enough

05:00.425 --> 05:02.343
to know what was going on.

05:02.385 --> 05:03.929
So they got to have

05:02.385 --> 05:03.929
a good big brother

05:03.971 --> 05:05.931
and all I got was  them.

05:05.973 --> 05:08.349
Look, I'm sorry, okay, I just,

05:05.973 --> 05:08.349
I don't live there anymore.

05:08.391 --> 05:09.935
I don't care!

05:09.977 --> 05:12.020
You have to make this

05:09.977 --> 05:12.020
up to me. I deserve

05:12.062 --> 05:13.147
a good big brother, too.

05:13.188 --> 05:14.022
Dewey, I know this is

05:14.064 --> 05:15.149
really important to you,

05:15.190 --> 05:16.817
but I just don't

05:15.190 --> 05:16.817
have the time right now,

05:16.858 --> 05:18.401
so I'll call you

05:16.858 --> 05:18.401
in a couple days, okay?

05:18.443 --> 05:19.945
No, do not hang up on me.

05:19.987 --> 05:21.529
(dial tone)

05:21.571 --> 05:22.948
(groans)

05:22.990 --> 05:25.951
Don't you look handsome?

05:22.990 --> 05:25.951
My little working man's

05:25.993 --> 05:27.535
first day on the job.

05:27.577 --> 05:29.746
Do not do anything

05:27.577 --> 05:29.746
to mess this up.

05:29.788 --> 05:31.372
Our whole family needs me

05:31.414 --> 05:32.791
to have this job.

05:32.833 --> 05:34.542
Don't worry, Mom,

05:32.833 --> 05:34.542
if it will save the family,

05:34.584 --> 05:36.253
I won't stack

05:34.584 --> 05:36.253
the toilet paper sideways.

05:36.295 --> 05:38.172
Those kinds of

05:36.295 --> 05:38.172
wisenheimer remarks

05:38.213 --> 05:40.548
are exactly what I'm

05:38.213 --> 05:40.548
talking about. Now go.

05:40.590 --> 05:43.384
You don't want to be late

05:40.590 --> 05:43.384
for the training session.

05:43.426 --> 05:47.014
Hello, I'm Dale Young,

05:43.426 --> 05:47.014
district supervisor.

05:47.055 --> 05:49.766
Now, we're going to have

05:47.055 --> 05:49.766
a lot of Lucky Aide fun today,

05:49.808 --> 05:53.020
but there's also a lot

05:49.808 --> 05:53.020
for our new trainees to learn.

05:53.061 --> 05:56.355
Not to mention our employees

05:53.061 --> 05:56.355
who need a little refresher.

05:57.482 --> 05:59.400
What is this, Feldspar--

05:57.482 --> 05:59.400
the fifth time?

05:59.442 --> 06:00.401
We can call it that.

06:00.443 --> 06:02.445
You leave the store

06:00.443 --> 06:02.445
unlocked one night,

06:02.487 --> 06:03.989
it's like the

06:02.487 --> 06:03.989
sky fell in.

06:04.031 --> 06:05.448
Mr. Feldspar,

06:04.031 --> 06:05.448
I'm sure you don't want

06:05.490 --> 06:07.326
to get your fellow

06:05.490 --> 06:07.326
trainee in trouble.

06:08.493 --> 06:11.205
You must be Malcolm, Lois' boy.

06:11.246 --> 06:12.080
Hey, tell me,

06:12.122 --> 06:13.414
is Beans as much fun at home

06:13.456 --> 06:14.415
as she is at work?

06:14.457 --> 06:15.792
Who?

06:14.457 --> 06:15.792
Hey, Dave,

06:15.834 --> 06:17.836
can you picture

06:15.834 --> 06:17.836
Beans having kids?

06:18.670 --> 06:20.630
Beans?

06:20.672 --> 06:23.424
Now, we're gonna start with

06:20.672 --> 06:23.424
a little instructional video,

06:23.466 --> 06:28.138
and then I hope everyone has

06:23.466 --> 06:28.138
their role-playing hats on.

06:31.058 --> 06:33.268
NARRATOR:

06:31.058 --> 06:33.268
Lucky Aide--

06:33.310 --> 06:36.437
It's another word for "family,"

06:33.310 --> 06:36.437
and like family,

06:36.479 --> 06:38.065
we all pull

06:36.479 --> 06:38.065
in the same direction,

06:38.106 --> 06:43.653
toward the same goal,

06:38.106 --> 06:43.653
from the lowliest stock boy...

06:43.695 --> 06:48.075
to the district managers...

06:43.695 --> 06:48.075
all the way up to the president.

06:48.116 --> 06:49.450
Was that...?

06:49.492 --> 06:53.247
We're proud of our 95%

06:49.492 --> 06:53.247
employee retention rate.

06:53.288 --> 06:55.249
You may think you're

06:53.288 --> 06:55.249
just starting a job,

06:55.290 --> 06:58.043
but when you join

06:55.290 --> 06:58.043
the Lucky Aide family,

06:58.085 --> 07:01.088
you're here for life.

07:02.172 --> 07:04.465
Mr. Young said you

07:02.172 --> 07:04.465
did great in training.

07:04.507 --> 07:06.051
Well, what can

07:04.507 --> 07:06.051
I say, Beans?

07:06.093 --> 07:07.302
Oh, I'm sorry, Beans.

07:07.344 --> 07:08.845
Did I say something

07:07.344 --> 07:08.845
wrong, Beans?

07:08.887 --> 07:10.471
Now, I went

07:08.887 --> 07:10.471
to a lot of trouble

07:10.513 --> 07:12.140
to make sure you

07:10.513 --> 07:12.140
could work with Albert.

07:12.182 --> 07:13.516
He really knows

07:12.182 --> 07:13.516
what he's doing.

07:13.558 --> 07:15.143
You're gonna learn

07:13.558 --> 07:15.143
a lot from him.

07:15.185 --> 07:16.311
Hey, Albert!

07:16.353 --> 07:18.272
This is my son, Malcolm.

07:18.313 --> 07:20.315
Nah, that can't be your son.

07:20.357 --> 07:22.276
He ain't beautiful enough.

07:22.317 --> 07:25.153
(giggles)

07:25.195 --> 07:27.281
Did she just giggle?

07:27.322 --> 07:28.282
Okay, now.

07:28.323 --> 07:30.700
Those are empty boxes.

07:34.788 --> 07:36.539
Yes. They are.

07:36.581 --> 07:38.375
Good. Now, what you do is

07:38.417 --> 07:40.668
you take them

07:38.417 --> 07:40.668
in the freight elevator

07:40.710 --> 07:42.379
to the basement

07:42.421 --> 07:43.504
to the box-flattening area.

07:43.546 --> 07:45.173
You flatten the boxes,

07:45.215 --> 07:47.092
then take them

07:45.215 --> 07:47.092
back up the elevator,

07:47.134 --> 07:50.345
go out by the loading dock

07:47.134 --> 07:50.345
and throw them in the Dumpster.

07:50.387 --> 07:51.763
I figure, it's about

07:50.387 --> 07:51.763
six or seven trips.

07:51.805 --> 07:54.515
Shouldn't take you

07:51.805 --> 07:54.515
more than two hours.

07:54.557 --> 07:56.893
That Dumpster

07:54.557 --> 07:56.893
right over there?

07:56.935 --> 07:57.936
Yes.

07:57.978 --> 07:59.396
If I flatten them here, I can

07:59.438 --> 08:00.605
be done in, like, 20 minutes.

08:02.565 --> 08:06.403
You take them in the freight

08:02.565 --> 08:06.403
elevator to the basement

08:06.445 --> 08:08.322
to the box-flattening area.

08:08.363 --> 08:10.991
No, I got it.

08:08.363 --> 08:10.991
I was just wondering if...

08:11.032 --> 08:12.533
I understand.

08:12.575 --> 08:14.702
So I broke down the boxes

08:12.575 --> 08:14.702
right next to the Dumpster

08:14.744 --> 08:15.954
and saved so much time

08:15.996 --> 08:17.705
I was able

08:15.996 --> 08:17.705
to sweep out the stock room

08:17.747 --> 08:19.540
and do a whole week's

08:17.747 --> 08:19.540
worth of returns.

08:19.582 --> 08:21.751
That's great. Sounds like

08:19.582 --> 08:21.751
you had a good first day.

08:22.585 --> 08:24.171
So, what part

08:24.212 --> 08:28.216
of "box-flattening area"

08:24.212 --> 08:28.216
don't you understand?

08:28.258 --> 08:29.217
Huh?

08:29.259 --> 08:31.552
You were seen flattening boxes

08:31.594 --> 08:34.764
outside of the designated

08:31.594 --> 08:34.764
box-flattening area.

08:34.806 --> 08:36.766
I thought

08:34.806 --> 08:36.766
I made myself clear.

08:36.808 --> 08:39.186
Why even have

08:36.808 --> 08:39.186
a box-flattening area

08:39.227 --> 08:41.729
if you don't flatten

08:39.227 --> 08:41.729
the boxes there?

08:41.771 --> 08:44.191
But it only took me 20 minutes,

08:41.771 --> 08:44.191
so I was able to... Mom.

08:44.232 --> 08:45.359
Albert, I'm sorry.

08:45.400 --> 08:46.443
I'll write him up.

08:46.485 --> 08:48.153
What? But you just said that...

08:48.195 --> 08:49.863
You're supposed to

08:48.195 --> 08:49.863
do as you're told.

08:53.616 --> 08:55.994
Thanks for taking

08:53.616 --> 08:55.994
the heat off me.

08:56.036 --> 08:57.578
I forgot my shoes again.

09:04.002 --> 09:07.005
This is ridiculous!

09:04.002 --> 09:07.005
You're being completely

09:04.002 --> 09:07.005
arbitrary and asinine.

09:07.047 --> 09:08.465
One minute you're

09:07.047 --> 09:08.465
telling me I'm

09:08.507 --> 09:09.757
doing a great job,

09:08.507 --> 09:09.757
and the next minute

09:09.799 --> 09:10.758
you're writing me up!

09:10.800 --> 09:12.386
You broke the rules, Malcolm.

09:12.427 --> 09:15.180
Come on, that box-flattening

09:12.427 --> 09:15.180
area is a stupid rule.

09:15.222 --> 09:16.223
You know I'm right.

09:16.264 --> 09:17.765
Albert is

09:16.264 --> 09:17.765
a grade-five employee.

09:17.807 --> 09:19.600
He has put in

09:17.807 --> 09:19.600
20 years of service time.

09:19.642 --> 09:21.269
Sometimes

09:19.642 --> 09:21.269
that's more important

09:21.311 --> 09:22.603
than what's right or wrong.

09:23.646 --> 09:25.606
Who  are  you?

09:25.648 --> 09:26.983
Stop being

09:25.648 --> 09:26.983
so melodramatic.

09:27.025 --> 09:28.609
No, seriously, I want to know.

09:28.651 --> 09:29.652
Because the mother I know

09:29.694 --> 09:31.612
has spent her entire

09:29.694 --> 09:31.612
life ranting

09:31.654 --> 09:34.199
about always doing the right

09:31.654 --> 09:34.199
thing, no matter what the cost,

09:34.241 --> 09:35.616
no matter how

09:34.241 --> 09:35.616
unpopular it is,

09:35.658 --> 09:36.784
and now you're

09:35.658 --> 09:36.784
standing here

09:36.826 --> 09:38.870
getting all caught up

09:36.826 --> 09:38.870
in who's a grade five

09:38.912 --> 09:40.455
and blindly

09:38.912 --> 09:40.455
obeying authority.

09:40.497 --> 09:42.416
Honestly, Malcolm,

09:40.497 --> 09:42.416
where'd you get the idea

09:42.457 --> 09:43.624
that a job is

09:42.457 --> 09:43.624
supposed to be fun?

09:43.666 --> 09:46.002
That's not what

09:43.666 --> 09:46.002
I'm talking about!

09:46.044 --> 09:47.795
The truth is, work

09:46.044 --> 09:47.795
is hard and miserable

09:47.837 --> 09:49.256
and nobody likes doing it.

09:49.297 --> 09:51.632
I have the greatest job

09:49.297 --> 09:51.632
in the world!

09:51.674 --> 09:52.800
You got a job?

09:52.842 --> 09:54.635
Yeah,

09:52.842 --> 09:54.635
with Hygienic Meat Packing.

09:54.677 --> 09:56.430
All I do all day is cut meat.

09:56.471 --> 09:57.431
With knives and saws.

09:57.472 --> 09:59.015
There's blood everywhere

09:59.057 --> 10:01.642
and there's all these guys

09:59.057 --> 10:01.642
swearing in Spanish,

10:01.684 --> 10:03.644
and they pay me

10:01.684 --> 10:03.644
12 bucks an hour!

10:03.686 --> 10:05.230
12 bucks an hour?

10:03.686 --> 10:05.230
I only make $5.50.

10:05.272 --> 10:06.647
Actually,

10:06.689 --> 10:08.649
with the write-up,

10:06.689 --> 10:08.649
you're bumped down to $3.75.

10:08.691 --> 10:10.651
Now you better go

10:08.691 --> 10:10.651
finish your homework.

10:10.693 --> 10:12.028
Dinner's in

10:10.693 --> 10:12.028
a half an hour.

10:12.070 --> 10:14.239
I am so proud of you guys.

10:14.281 --> 10:17.242
You're so open

10:14.281 --> 10:17.242
to connecting with your babies.

10:17.284 --> 10:19.244
If my dads

10:17.284 --> 10:19.244
were like you,

10:19.286 --> 10:21.913
I'm sure I wouldn't have slept

10:19.286 --> 10:21.913
with so many men in college.

10:21.955 --> 10:23.248
See you next class.

10:23.290 --> 10:24.665
We can't wait.

10:28.503 --> 10:31.256
Okay, I've got Jamie to win

10:28.503 --> 10:31.256
and Kevin to show.

10:31.298 --> 10:33.300
(all shouting)

10:37.512 --> 10:38.679
Jamie's diaper...

10:38.721 --> 10:40.265
Two pounds.

10:38.721 --> 10:40.265
Yes!

10:40.307 --> 10:42.267
Dakota...

10:42.309 --> 10:44.144
Two and a

10:42.309 --> 10:44.144
quarter pounds.

10:42.309 --> 10:44.144
Yes.

10:44.185 --> 10:45.353
Jasmine...

10:48.106 --> 10:49.690
Four pounds?

10:49.732 --> 10:50.900
Man, that's unholy.

10:50.942 --> 10:52.277
I am so sorry

10:52.319 --> 10:55.530
I was ever disappointed

10:52.319 --> 10:55.530
you were born a girl.

10:57.740 --> 10:59.493
Reese, this meat

10:57.740 --> 10:59.493
is delicious. Thank you.

10:59.534 --> 11:01.286
Malcolm, would you

10:59.534 --> 11:01.286
like another piece?

11:01.328 --> 11:03.538
I don't think I'm authorized

11:01.328 --> 11:03.538
to make that decision.

11:03.580 --> 11:05.748
Maybe we should ask

11:03.580 --> 11:05.748
a grade-five employee.

11:05.790 --> 11:07.292
Hey, I'm a grade-five employee.

11:07.334 --> 11:08.709
Wow. How

11:07.334 --> 11:08.709
do they get

11:08.751 --> 11:09.710
the meat this tender?

11:09.752 --> 11:11.588
Well, that's

11:09.752 --> 11:11.588
the thing about veal.

11:11.630 --> 11:14.090
Imagine if you took Jamie

11:11.630 --> 11:14.090
and put him in a little box

11:14.132 --> 11:15.716
where he would never

11:14.132 --> 11:15.716
see daylight.

11:15.758 --> 11:18.719
You don't let him move so his

11:15.758 --> 11:18.719
muscles don't get all tough.

11:18.761 --> 11:21.722
He's basically blind and you

11:18.761 --> 11:21.722
force-feed him nothing but milk.

11:21.764 --> 11:24.725
That's what makes him

11:21.764 --> 11:24.725
taste so good.

11:24.767 --> 11:25.726
Hal, how did Jamie

11:25.768 --> 11:26.727
do in class today?

11:26.769 --> 11:27.728
Fine. I guess.

11:27.770 --> 11:30.357
For a kid

11:27.770 --> 11:30.357
who can't fill a diaper.

11:31.358 --> 11:33.151
This is strange.

11:31.358 --> 11:33.151
Why would we have

11:33.193 --> 11:34.569
so many leftovers?

11:42.243 --> 11:43.328
(yelps)

11:43.370 --> 11:44.371
You hung up on me!

11:44.412 --> 11:45.746
What are you doing here?

11:44.412 --> 11:45.746
I told you.

11:45.788 --> 11:48.749
I can't handle Reese

11:45.788 --> 11:48.749
and Malcolm anymore.

11:48.791 --> 11:50.001
I need a good big brother

11:50.043 --> 11:51.586
before it's too late!

11:51.628 --> 11:53.754
I'm like one wedgie away

11:51.628 --> 11:53.754
from an eating disorder.

11:53.796 --> 11:55.549
You're here by yourself?

11:55.590 --> 11:58.009
Francis, please, all

11:55.590 --> 11:58.009
I want is a few minutes

11:58.051 --> 11:59.760
of someone being nice to me.

11:59.802 --> 12:00.928
Is that really

12:00.970 --> 12:04.807
such a big thing for

12:00.970 --> 12:04.807
a kid my age to ask?

12:06.393 --> 12:09.770
Dad, Dad, Dad,

12:06.393 --> 12:09.770
calm down. He's fine.

12:09.812 --> 12:10.813
I have the day off Saturday.

12:10.855 --> 12:11.981
I'll bring him home then.

12:12.023 --> 12:14.025
You gotta give him

12:12.023 --> 12:14.025
credit, you know.

12:14.067 --> 12:15.985
He got to the ranch

12:14.067 --> 12:15.985
all by himself.

12:16.027 --> 12:18.572
The first time you tried,

12:16.027 --> 12:18.572
you ended up in Mexico.

12:18.613 --> 12:19.573
Of course, I'd be happy

12:19.614 --> 12:20.781
to carry your bags outside.

12:20.823 --> 12:21.782
We wouldn't want you

12:21.824 --> 12:23.368
to get all hot and sweaty

12:23.410 --> 12:25.370
out in the blaring heat

12:23.410 --> 12:25.370
of the parking lot.

12:25.412 --> 12:28.164
Malcolm. You're not

12:25.412 --> 12:28.164
scheduled for today.

12:28.206 --> 12:29.457
I'm just looking

12:28.206 --> 12:29.457
for my mom.

12:29.499 --> 12:31.209
She's out back on her break.

12:33.628 --> 12:34.962
Last night, Mom accused me

12:35.004 --> 12:37.424
of being obsessive

12:35.004 --> 12:37.424
about getting written up.

12:37.465 --> 12:38.799
So I stayed up all last night

12:38.841 --> 12:39.967
thinking up

12:38.841 --> 12:39.967
a bunch of comebacks,

12:40.009 --> 12:41.595
and I even have

12:40.009 --> 12:41.595
potential comebacks

12:41.636 --> 12:43.804
to every possible comeback

12:41.636 --> 12:43.804
of hers. There is no way she...

12:43.846 --> 12:45.265
(gasps)

12:56.150 --> 12:57.110
You're smoking?!

12:57.151 --> 12:58.986
After all the times

12:57.151 --> 12:58.986
you lectured us?

12:59.028 --> 13:00.196
After telling us

12:59.028 --> 13:00.196
if we smoked,

13:00.238 --> 13:02.073
you would kill us

13:00.238 --> 13:02.073
before the cancer did?!

13:02.115 --> 13:03.032
After you would

13:02.115 --> 13:03.032
push Francis'

13:03.074 --> 13:05.076
lit cigarettes back in his mouth

13:05.118 --> 13:07.662
and make him swallow?!

13:05.118 --> 13:07.662
And you smoke?!

13:08.455 --> 13:09.664
You smoke?!

13:10.665 --> 13:12.626
Look, it's not what you think.

13:12.667 --> 13:13.627
When I work,

13:13.668 --> 13:14.628
I have two cigarettes--

13:14.669 --> 13:16.463
one on my morning break,

13:14.669 --> 13:16.463
one in the afternoon.

13:16.504 --> 13:17.464
No more, no less.

13:17.505 --> 13:18.839
Who are you?!

13:18.881 --> 13:20.634
You have to stop saying that.

13:20.675 --> 13:21.635
I will quit eventually,

13:21.676 --> 13:23.428
but until then, the only thing

13:23.470 --> 13:25.012
that's stopping your father

13:25.054 --> 13:26.847
from smoking six packs a day

13:26.889 --> 13:28.849
is knowing that

13:26.889 --> 13:28.849
we quit together.

13:28.891 --> 13:29.850
But you didn't quit.

13:29.892 --> 13:31.852
But he knows I did.

13:31.894 --> 13:32.853
But you didn't!

13:32.895 --> 13:35.231
He knows I did.

13:35.273 --> 13:37.651
You lie and you smoke.

13:37.692 --> 13:39.653
Oh, for God's sake, Malcolm.

13:39.694 --> 13:40.861
Lois, Lois, I just remembered

13:40.903 --> 13:43.281
you were holding

13:40.903 --> 13:43.281
my lit cigarette in your hand,

13:43.323 --> 13:44.324
and I wanted

13:43.323 --> 13:44.324
to thank you

13:44.365 --> 13:46.033
for holding on

13:44.365 --> 13:46.033
to my cigarettes...

13:46.075 --> 13:47.034
which are mine.

13:47.076 --> 13:48.869
He knows.

13:47.076 --> 13:48.869
Okay.

13:48.911 --> 13:52.457
I think I left

13:48.911 --> 13:52.457
my register open.

13:52.499 --> 13:54.875
Okay, Malcolm, you caught me.

13:55.918 --> 13:57.671
This has to be kept secret.

13:57.712 --> 13:59.880
So I'm going to ask you

13:57.712 --> 13:59.880
for a favor.

13:59.922 --> 14:01.508
A favor?

14:01.549 --> 14:02.883
You're asking me

14:01.549 --> 14:02.883
for a favor

14:02.925 --> 14:04.469
after you totally

14:02.925 --> 14:04.469
hung me out to dry.

14:04.511 --> 14:06.053
I'm just asking for

14:04.511 --> 14:06.053
a little flexibility.

14:06.095 --> 14:07.472
Please.

14:07.514 --> 14:08.889
For your father and for me,

14:08.931 --> 14:11.100
just keep the smoking

14:08.931 --> 14:11.100
to yourself.

14:11.142 --> 14:12.352
Please.

14:13.812 --> 14:15.772
Yeah, okay.

14:15.814 --> 14:17.940
Wow, she's talking to me

14:15.814 --> 14:17.940
like a human being.

14:17.982 --> 14:19.567
This can't get

14:17.982 --> 14:19.567
any weirder.

14:19.609 --> 14:22.069
Thank you, Malcolm.

14:22.111 --> 14:24.531
Yes, it can.

14:24.572 --> 14:25.906
I can't believe

14:24.572 --> 14:25.906
I used to think

14:25.948 --> 14:27.908
that taking care

14:25.948 --> 14:27.908
of the baby was a chore.

14:27.950 --> 14:29.869
This class has

14:27.950 --> 14:29.869
really opened my eyes.

14:32.955 --> 14:34.165
Time.

14:36.751 --> 14:37.918
Aiden wins again.

14:37.960 --> 14:42.131
I knew I shouldn't let you have

14:37.960 --> 14:42.131
that cracker.

14:42.173 --> 14:43.299
I'll pay you

14:42.173 --> 14:43.299
next class.

14:43.341 --> 14:44.509
I got to go.

14:44.551 --> 14:45.510
You're not going

14:44.551 --> 14:45.510
to stick around

14:45.552 --> 14:47.178
for the suction contest?

14:48.179 --> 14:49.930
Will you take a watch?

14:49.972 --> 14:52.350
Don't get too down about

14:49.972 --> 14:52.350
this probation thing.

14:52.392 --> 14:54.935
This job is mostly

14:52.392 --> 14:54.935
a beauty pageant.

14:54.977 --> 14:56.312
You know what's weird?

14:56.354 --> 14:59.106
You get used to thinking

14:56.354 --> 14:59.106
of a person as being

14:59.148 --> 15:00.941
so much more powerful

14:59.148 --> 15:00.941
than you,

15:00.983 --> 15:03.944
then something shifts and

15:00.983 --> 15:03.944
it becomes kind of awkward.

15:03.986 --> 15:06.113
Oh, my God, are you

15:03.986 --> 15:06.113
my boss now?!

15:03.986 --> 15:06.113
What?

15:06.155 --> 15:07.114
This is so unfair.

15:07.156 --> 15:08.115
Year after year,

15:08.157 --> 15:10.951
why can't...

15:10.993 --> 15:13.120
It's nice to see one

15:10.993 --> 15:13.120
of the good guys win.

15:13.162 --> 15:14.955
Why don't you

15:13.162 --> 15:14.955
take a load off.

15:14.997 --> 15:16.332
I'll go get you

15:14.997 --> 15:16.332
a cup of joe.

15:16.374 --> 15:17.667
No worries, chief.

15:23.381 --> 15:25.174
(grunting)

15:35.643 --> 15:37.061
Whoa.

15:42.191 --> 15:43.610
Malcolm.

15:45.486 --> 15:47.154
It's not what it looks like.

15:47.196 --> 15:48.782
YOUNG:

15:47.196 --> 15:48.782
Lois, sorry,

15:47.196 --> 15:48.782
are you in there?

15:48.823 --> 15:49.783
I'll explain later.

15:49.824 --> 15:51.451
I know exactly what this

15:49.824 --> 15:51.451
looks like to you,

15:51.492 --> 15:53.244
but I'm asking you for

15:51.492 --> 15:53.244
a little flexibility.

15:53.286 --> 15:54.245
Trust me.

15:54.287 --> 15:55.371
Lois, where's the...?

15:55.413 --> 15:57.373
What's going on here?

15:57.415 --> 15:59.459
Well, I'll have to

15:57.415 --> 15:59.459
write Malcolm up again.

15:59.500 --> 16:00.585
He's flattened

16:00.627 --> 16:01.586
another box

16:01.628 --> 16:03.087
outside of the box

16:01.628 --> 16:03.087
flattening area.

16:09.051 --> 16:11.011
The guys at work are great.

16:11.053 --> 16:13.598
I already have a nickname--

16:11.053 --> 16:13.598
Ten Fingers.

16:13.640 --> 16:16.016
The old Ten Fingers

16:13.640 --> 16:16.016
wasn't using it anymore.

16:16.058 --> 16:17.477
I'm proud of you, son.

16:17.518 --> 16:19.019
You're working now.

16:19.061 --> 16:22.064
I feel like I could

16:19.061 --> 16:22.064
talk to you, man to man.

16:22.106 --> 16:24.275
You know, about

16:22.106 --> 16:24.275
grown up things--

16:24.317 --> 16:25.860
expenses...

16:25.902 --> 16:27.027
cheaters...

16:27.069 --> 16:29.029
Can I borrow

16:27.069 --> 16:29.029
some money from you?

16:29.071 --> 16:30.907
Yeah. How much do you need?

16:30.949 --> 16:34.661
Uh... how much do you have?

16:36.454 --> 16:39.457
Why don't you just tell me

16:36.454 --> 16:39.457
how much you need.

16:41.250 --> 16:43.252
100... 2...

16:44.462 --> 16:45.880
and another 100.

16:47.089 --> 16:50.050
You might want to rinse off

16:47.089 --> 16:50.050
the bills in cold water.

16:50.092 --> 16:51.093
They stick together.

16:52.470 --> 16:54.848
It was so cool

16:52.470 --> 16:54.848
when that guy

16:52.470 --> 16:54.848
at the truck stop

16:54.889 --> 16:57.057
blew the smoke ring

16:54.889 --> 16:57.057
out of the hole in his throat.

16:57.099 --> 16:58.726
That was fun, wasn't it?

16:58.768 --> 17:01.855
How come you're the only good

16:58.768 --> 17:01.855
one in the family?

17:01.896 --> 17:02.856
Why didn't any of it

17:02.897 --> 17:04.858
rub off on Reese or Malcolm?

17:04.899 --> 17:06.233
Dewey, would you cut it out?

17:06.275 --> 17:08.110
No, I mean it.

17:06.275 --> 17:08.110
You're such a good brother.

17:08.152 --> 17:10.070
I'll bet they didn't

17:08.152 --> 17:10.070
even appreciate it.

17:10.112 --> 17:12.907
Dewey! I was never like this

17:10.112 --> 17:12.907
with Reese and Malcolm.

17:12.949 --> 17:14.074
I treated them like crap.

17:14.116 --> 17:15.702
Way worse than

17:14.116 --> 17:15.702
they treat you.

17:15.743 --> 17:17.495
That's impossible.

17:17.537 --> 17:19.288
I tortured them all the time.

17:17.537 --> 17:19.288
I beat them up,

17:19.330 --> 17:20.665
I took their stuff,

17:20.707 --> 17:21.916
I locked them in closets.

17:21.958 --> 17:23.543
You know that scar

17:21.958 --> 17:23.543
on Reese's back?

17:23.584 --> 17:24.752
That's from a bayonet.

17:25.795 --> 17:27.463
Where did I even get a bayonet?!

17:27.505 --> 17:28.965
But you couldn't have.

17:29.007 --> 17:32.259
The way they talk about you...

17:29.007 --> 17:32.259
They love you so much.

17:32.301 --> 17:34.261
Dewey, let me let you in

17:32.301 --> 17:34.261
on a little secret.

17:34.303 --> 17:37.056
Sometimes people love people

17:34.303 --> 17:37.056
for no reason.

17:38.016 --> 17:39.475
Like Whoopi Goldberg.

17:39.517 --> 17:40.727
Hmm.

17:40.768 --> 17:42.520
It's even weirder with brothers.

17:43.980 --> 17:45.773
So you're saying...

17:45.815 --> 17:49.527
I'm the only one

17:45.815 --> 17:49.527
you were ever nice to?

17:49.569 --> 17:50.611
Pretty much.

17:51.821 --> 17:54.365
You know, you have

17:51.821 --> 17:54.365
a real opportunity here.

17:54.407 --> 17:55.700
You can break the cycle.

17:55.742 --> 17:57.326
You can be a good

17:55.742 --> 17:57.326
brother to Jamie.

17:57.368 --> 17:59.161
You can be the one

17:57.368 --> 17:59.161
kid in this family

17:59.203 --> 18:02.081
who takes care of the younger

17:59.203 --> 18:02.081
one and looks out for him.

18:03.165 --> 18:06.126
How is that fair?

18:06.168 --> 18:07.378
Yeah, you're right.

18:08.629 --> 18:09.964
MALCOLM:

18:08.629 --> 18:09.964
Trying to impress

18:10.006 --> 18:11.507
the cool kids?

18:11.549 --> 18:12.717
Hey, Malcolm. Good news.

18:12.759 --> 18:14.719
The head

18:12.759 --> 18:14.719
of security told me

18:14.761 --> 18:16.721
that the surveillance

18:14.761 --> 18:16.721
cameras proved

18:16.763 --> 18:19.139
you didn't flatten

18:16.763 --> 18:19.139
that box on purpose.

18:19.181 --> 18:21.141
You're also using

18:19.181 --> 18:21.141
too much soap in the bathroom.

18:21.183 --> 18:22.309
Anyway, you're off probation.

18:22.351 --> 18:24.520
Wow, thanks for going

18:22.351 --> 18:24.520
to the mat for me.

18:24.562 --> 18:25.772
What is your problem?

18:25.813 --> 18:28.608
My problem is, I have

18:25.813 --> 18:28.608
no idea who you are.

18:28.649 --> 18:30.150
I thought I had

18:28.649 --> 18:30.150
this mother

18:30.192 --> 18:32.570
that was abrupt

18:30.192 --> 18:32.570
and short-tempered and rude,

18:32.612 --> 18:35.406
but who at least would stand up

18:32.612 --> 18:35.406
for what's right.

18:35.448 --> 18:36.950
That's not who you are.

18:36.991 --> 18:38.534
I did something nice for you,

18:38.576 --> 18:39.744
and you act like it

18:38.576 --> 18:39.744
didn't even happen.

18:39.786 --> 18:41.161
You did something nice for me

18:41.203 --> 18:42.747
because it was

18:41.203 --> 18:42.747
the right thing to do.

18:42.789 --> 18:45.332
I'm simply making you obey rules

18:42.789 --> 18:45.332
because I'm your mother.

18:45.374 --> 18:47.043
That's not fair.

18:47.085 --> 18:48.419
If this favor thing

18:47.085 --> 18:48.419
doesn't work both ways,

18:48.461 --> 18:50.337
then why am I keeping

18:48.461 --> 18:50.337
a big secret for you?

18:50.379 --> 18:52.172
Why shouldn't I just tell Dad?

18:52.214 --> 18:53.173
You're not going

18:52.214 --> 18:53.173
to tell your father.

18:53.215 --> 18:54.341
How do you know?

18:54.383 --> 18:57.177
Because, Malcolm,

18:54.383 --> 18:57.177
that's not who you are.

18:59.806 --> 19:01.181
Why do you do this to me?

19:01.223 --> 19:03.559
Malcolm, I know

19:01.223 --> 19:03.559
this is hard for you.

19:03.601 --> 19:04.978
You're growing up.

19:05.019 --> 19:06.186
You're sick of living

19:05.019 --> 19:06.186
under my authority.

19:06.228 --> 19:07.772
You want me to cut

19:06.228 --> 19:07.772
you some slack.

19:07.814 --> 19:08.773
You're wondering

19:07.814 --> 19:08.773
when I'll finally

19:08.815 --> 19:11.442
see you as an adult.

19:11.484 --> 19:13.360
Well... that's never

19:11.484 --> 19:13.360
going to happen.

19:13.402 --> 19:14.821
That's just not

19:13.402 --> 19:14.821
the way

19:14.862 --> 19:15.863
it works.

19:15.905 --> 19:18.198
You can move

19:15.905 --> 19:18.198
away from home,

19:18.240 --> 19:20.200
you can get married,

19:18.240 --> 19:20.200
even have kids of your own,

19:20.242 --> 19:23.579
you can even become

19:20.242 --> 19:23.579
a professor of physics at MIT.

19:23.621 --> 19:25.623
I will always be your mother.

19:25.665 --> 19:29.168
And that's just the way

19:25.665 --> 19:29.168
it is until one of us dies.

19:30.419 --> 19:31.378
You want to put your head

19:31.420 --> 19:33.047
between your knees

19:31.420 --> 19:33.047
for a few seconds?

19:33.089 --> 19:34.841
No, I'm okay.

19:35.633 --> 19:36.592
Look...

19:36.634 --> 19:37.635
will you please

19:37.677 --> 19:39.219
just give me one thing?

19:40.262 --> 19:41.806
Please stop smoking.

19:41.848 --> 19:43.182
I already quit.

19:44.266 --> 19:46.102
Are you lying?

19:46.144 --> 19:48.062
Of course not.

20:01.492 --> 20:02.618
Okay, Jamie.

20:02.660 --> 20:04.244
It all comes down to this.

20:04.286 --> 20:06.873
Just do it like we practiced

20:04.286 --> 20:06.873
in the garage.

20:20.678 --> 20:22.262
Go, go, go.

20:22.304 --> 20:23.681
We've got the whole family

20:22.304 --> 20:23.681
together.

20:23.723 --> 20:25.683
We should celebrate with

20:23.723 --> 20:25.683
a nice dinner at...

20:25.725 --> 20:28.227
(Hal murmuring)

20:30.897 --> 20:32.314
(cheering)

20:35.693 --> 20:37.277
Pay up, suckers!

20:37.319 --> 20:39.446
You treated your babies

20:39.488 --> 20:41.532
like they were made of glass,

20:41.574 --> 20:43.076
and now you suffer.

20:43.117 --> 20:44.284
(Hal cackling)

20:44.326 --> 20:45.661
What are you waiting for?

20:45.703 --> 20:48.330
I want to remember

20:45.703 --> 20:48.330
that goofy smile.

20:48.372 --> 20:51.876
Nobody's going to be

20:48.372 --> 20:51.876
seeing that for a long time.

20:51.918 --> 20:54.003
Whoo-hoo! Whoo-hoo!

20:51.918 --> 20:54.003
Look at me! Whoo-hoo!
