<i>Previously on Boston Legal…</i>

00:01.240 --> 00:02.410
I'm no psychologist,

00:02.450 --> 00:05.600
but I believe the best way to
relieve anxiety is to talk about it.

00:05.640 --> 00:06.370
Humperdinck.

00:06.410 --> 00:07.880
Clearly I make you uncomfortable.

00:07.920 --> 00:08.570
What is it?

00:08.610 --> 00:11.410
Mr Washington, you were
convicted of rape in 1985?

00:11.450 --> 00:12.910
Date rape, and I was innocent.

00:12.950 --> 00:14.140
You were convicted, yes or no?

00:14.180 --> 00:15.360
She was my girlfriend.

00:15.400 --> 00:16.490
She was 16.

00:16.500 --> 00:18.290
I was 17. And she was white.

00:18.330 --> 00:20.910
She claimed that I
raped her, but I did not.

00:20.950 --> 00:23.270
So you were convicted of rape.

00:23.280 --> 00:25.100
In review, didn't do this one.

00:25.140 --> 00:26.980
You were framed. You
didn't commit the rape.

00:27.020 --> 00:27.920
The victim made it up.

00:27.960 --> 00:30.600
I am innocent of this crime.

00:47.200 --> 00:49.280
I'm looking for Alan Shore.

00:50.060 --> 00:50.810
It's important.

00:50.850 --> 00:53.090
–Is he expecting you?
–No.

00:53.600 --> 00:56.108
May I tell him what this is regarding?

00:56.110 --> 00:57.660
No.

00:58.370 --> 01:00.940
Okay. Just a minute. I'll…

01:08.350 --> 01:08.940
Okay.

01:08.950 --> 01:10.870
Thank you for agreeing to see me.

01:10.910 --> 01:15.180
Well, my assistant said
it, uh, was some sort of emergency.

01:15.190 --> 01:18.040
Yes, my daughter was murdered.

01:20.750 --> 01:22.580
I'm very sorry.

01:22.960 --> 01:27.350
The man who murdered her was found not
guilty by reason of temporary insanity.

01:27.390 --> 01:30.580
He's a man of means
with skilled attorneys.

01:32.890 --> 01:35.940
And how exactly can I help you?

01:35.950 --> 01:40.720
I would like to kill this man and be found
not guilty by reason of temporary insanity.

01:40.760 --> 01:46.898
I would like you to advise me as to what legal
steps I must take in order to accomplish this.

01:48.130 --> 01:50.860
Uh, Ms Kelly, I don't know
what you've heard about me,

01:50.900 --> 01:55.990
but… I certainly would not
and could not advise a person…

01:56.000 --> 01:59.500
on how to… get away with murder.

01:59.510 --> 02:01.250
Why not?

02:01.850 --> 02:04.400
Well, because that would me
a conspirator, for starters,

02:04.440 --> 02:09.550
and personally, I'm not a
great believer in murdering.

02:11.210 --> 02:12.860
Let me start over.

02:12.870 --> 02:14.370
I have decided to write a novel.

02:14.410 --> 02:18.770
It's about a woman who kills a man and
is acquitted on grounds of insanity.

02:18.810 --> 02:20.810
I would like to hire
you as a consultant.

02:20.850 --> 02:26.690
What legal steps must my protagonist
take in order to accomplish this?

02:27.260 --> 02:29.660
You cannot be serious.

02:31.740 --> 02:34.630
On a positive note, I can tell
you— for what it's worth—

02:34.670 --> 02:36.540
you seem totally insane.

02:36.550 --> 02:37.940
Thank you.

02:37.950 --> 02:40.510
How best do I legally establish that?

02:40.520 --> 02:42.930
I need to know exactly.

02:43.950 --> 02:47.800
MsKelly, my advice to
you… would be to forget it.

02:47.810 --> 02:50.080
By virtue of the fact
that you've come here,

02:50.120 --> 02:55.980
you've demonstrated that you understand
the nature and quality of the act.

02:56.470 --> 03:01.690
As for legal insanity, you don't qualify.

03:06.400 --> 03:08.780
I'm disappointed.

Hope And Gory

03:50.710 --> 03:52.620
Here it is right here.

03:53.610 --> 03:56.820
Hannah Kelly, age 22, bludgeoned to death.

03:56.830 --> 04:00.170
Sean Harmon— acquitted.
Temporary insanity.

04:00.180 --> 04:02.350
It all happened a month ago.

04:02.360 --> 04:04.510
Do you think this woman
really plans to kill him?

04:04.550 --> 04:06.300
I don't know.

04:06.310 --> 04:08.620
She was so odd.

04:08.630 --> 04:10.840
I couldn't get a read on her.

04:10.850 --> 04:13.310
I wonder if I should call the police.

04:13.320 --> 04:14.720
How did she leave it?

04:14.730 --> 04:16.070
I'm not sure.

04:16.079 --> 04:19.190
I think I dissuaded her. But…

04:19.560 --> 04:21.690
I'm not sure.
–Alan.

04:22.590 --> 04:25.000
I was wondering whether we
might discuss your word salad.

04:25.040 --> 04:27.180
Maybe later, over drinks?

04:34.610 --> 04:36.820
It looks more like a
courthouse than a jail.

04:36.860 --> 04:39.520
Look. The police department
is part of the courthouse.

04:39.560 --> 04:41.900
–Saves time, I suppose.
–Yeah.

04:46.300 --> 04:47.470
Hold on.

04:47.680 --> 04:49.580
Hello, my name is Katie
Lloyd. I'm an attorney.

04:49.620 --> 04:52.110
I called ahead. This is my
colleague Jerry Espenson.

04:52.150 --> 04:54.460
I believe you're holding my client.

05:02.680 --> 05:04.690
It reminds me a little
of Mayberry R.F.D

05:04.730 --> 05:06.520
Where is that?

05:08.390 --> 05:10.640
Hello, Joseph.

05:11.260 --> 05:12.850
May we go in?

05:12.860 --> 05:15.890
–Inside, with him?
–Please.

05:23.420 --> 05:25.334
Give a yell when you're done.

05:26.250 --> 05:27.640
Why were you arrested?

05:27.680 --> 05:29.410
For driving a car.

05:29.420 --> 05:34.500
Evidently, it's a crime for registered
sex offenders to operate motor vehicles
within the Middletown town borders.

05:34.540 --> 05:35.430
Beg your pardon?

05:35.470 --> 05:37.090
They passed it last night.

05:37.130 --> 05:39.020
Because of my prior rape conviction,

05:39.060 --> 05:42.930
I had to register here as
a sex offender, which I did.

05:42.940 --> 05:46.240
My job is here— the
only job I can get.

05:46.250 --> 05:49.700
The people here have been
harassing me ever since I registered.

05:49.740 --> 05:51.740
My landlord evicted me.

05:51.750 --> 05:54.390
I've been banned from
public transportation.

05:54.430 --> 05:56.250
Now this.

05:56.890 --> 05:59.090
Sounds like you're not wanted.

05:59.100 --> 06:02.000
Maybe you should blow
this terrible town.

06:02.010 --> 06:04.360
I would if I were you.

06:13.040 --> 06:15.290
It's so unfair what's
being done to him, Shirley.

06:15.330 --> 06:17.250
He was trying to make
a new life for himself.

06:17.290 --> 06:20.960
It's hard enough for an ex-con without
an entire town conspiring against you.

06:21.000 --> 06:22.850
He was so excited to get this job,

06:22.890 --> 06:26.240
and they've essentially passed an
ordinance overnight to run him out.

06:26.280 --> 06:27.920
How much time are we
talking about here?

06:27.960 --> 06:29.070
His arraignment's at 11:00.

06:29.110 --> 06:31.030
I'd at least like to
get him out of jail.

06:31.070 --> 06:34.900
Shirley, there are many words to
describe you, but compassionate—

06:34.940 --> 06:37.140
Cut the crap, Jerry.

06:37.880 --> 06:42.540
You can handle his arraignment,
then it's back to work for us.

06:46.400 --> 06:49.170
Hey, Alan, did you report
that woman to the police yet?

06:49.210 --> 06:51.290
No. I still can't
decide whether I should.

06:51.330 --> 06:51.940
Would you?

06:51.980 --> 06:53.450
Well, probably not.

06:53.460 --> 06:54.130
Why not?

06:54.140 --> 06:56.670
Because she already killed him.

06:57.900 --> 07:00.680
<i>The information is still coming
in, but what we have learned—</i>

07:00.720 --> 07:03.280
<i>the shooter has been
identified as Patrice Kelly.</i>

07:03.320 --> 07:06.050
<i>If you recall, it was Ms Kelly's
daughter Hannah Kelly</i>

07:06.090 --> 07:09.020
<i>who was bludgeoned to death with
a vodka bottle by Sean Harmon,</i>

07:09.060 --> 07:10.620
<i>the man who was shot today.</i>

07:10.660 --> 07:11.810
<i>We are getting confirmation that</i>

07:11.850 --> 07:15.100
<i>Mr Harmon is dead from a single
gunshot wound to the head.</i>

07:15.140 --> 07:16.170
<i>As many of—</i>

07:16.210 --> 07:18.790
Okay, first thing—
get her into rehab.

07:18.800 --> 07:20.420
You want to put out a statement.

07:20.460 --> 07:21.260
I feel sick.

07:21.270 --> 07:24.630
Stay away from anything too
controversial, like Rutgers' basketball.

07:24.670 --> 07:25.860
Denny, I should've prevented this.

07:25.900 --> 07:28.320
I could've prevented this.

07:28.960 --> 07:31.010
Alan, you have a call from Patrice Kelly.

07:31.050 --> 07:33.530
She says you'll know
what it's regarding.

07:33.570 --> 07:35.940
Boy, it's exciting being you.

07:44.970 --> 07:47.420
They passed a law
criminalizing his driving a car?

07:47.460 --> 07:48.730
Yes, your honor, last night.

07:48.770 --> 07:50.900
They then arrested him
today, affording no notice—

07:50.940 --> 07:52.420
He was also arrested for assault.

07:52.460 --> 07:55.470
The suspect became violent with officers
when they tried—
–The suspect was simply told to get out of the car,

07:55.510 --> 07:58.160
and when he complied, he was thrown
against the hood, handcuffed—

07:58.200 --> 08:01.560
Anyone subject to a stop can be handc—
–He was not told the nature
of this ridiculous infraction,

08:01.600 --> 08:02.500
nor was he informed—

08:02.540 --> 08:04.050
Maybe when counsel has
children of her own,

08:04.090 --> 08:07.170
she might see the rationale in discouraging
sex offenders from prowling neighborhoods.

08:07.210 --> 08:08.450
He was not prowling, your honor.

08:08.490 --> 08:10.340
He was driving to his
place of employment.

08:10.380 --> 08:12.290
Uh, save your breath, Ms Lloyd.

08:12.330 --> 08:15.120
The charges against
Mr Washington are dismissed.

08:15.160 --> 08:16.280
Thank you, your honor.

08:16.320 --> 08:19.190
Might you also strike down this
capricious ordinance on the grounds—

08:19.230 --> 08:21.280
I'm sorry, Ms Lloyd. I can't do that.

08:21.320 --> 08:23.400
Towns have a right
to protect themselves,

08:23.440 --> 08:25.830
and Mr Washington is a
registered sex offender.

08:25.870 --> 08:28.440
And as such, faces enormous
difficulty getting employment.

08:28.480 --> 08:30.220
He was fortunate enough to do so here.

08:30.260 --> 08:32.635
I understand, but I gotta be honest.

08:32.640 --> 08:34.530
I live here myself.

08:34.539 --> 08:36.000
He's free to go,

08:36.010 --> 08:39.980
and I would hope that he
would do so, far, far away.

08:39.990 --> 08:42.049
We're adjourned.

09:00.360 --> 09:02.460
I lost my mind.

09:04.810 --> 09:06.440
I've been charged with a serious crime.

09:06.480 --> 09:10.506
I was wondering whether you'd
provide me with representation.

09:10.770 --> 09:12.310
No.

09:14.240 --> 09:17.276
Well, that seems at odds
with your showing up.

09:20.390 --> 09:24.890
It's not every day we encounter
compelling characters, is it?

09:25.550 --> 09:27.420
Do you expect to get away with this?

09:27.460 --> 09:28.470
I'm insane.

09:28.480 --> 09:29.660
Not legally.

09:29.670 --> 09:33.780
Well… that would be a jury's
call, which, with your influence—

09:33.790 --> 09:35.200
Patrice— may I
call you Patrice?

09:35.240 --> 09:36.230
I'd like that.

09:36.460 --> 09:38.450
Let's drop the little insanity act.

09:38.490 --> 09:40.200
Let's be frank.

09:40.530 --> 09:43.270
This was a premeditated,
calculated revenge killing.

09:43.310 --> 09:45.190
That's not true.

09:46.990 --> 09:50.470
But if it were true, he had it coming.

09:54.600 --> 09:56.590
So you took the case?

09:56.600 --> 09:59.460
She was just too fascinating to pass up.

09:59.470 --> 10:00.550
Would I like her?

10:00.590 --> 10:03.370
She's female, has a pulse.

10:04.500 --> 10:06.100
The arraignment's tomorrow.
You want in?

10:06.140 --> 10:08.060
Of course I want in.

10:08.270 --> 10:09.980
You ready?

10:11.450 --> 10:12.810
Ready for what?

10:12.820 --> 10:15.328
Lorraine and I are getting underpants.

10:16.190 --> 10:17.890
Drinks.

10:17.900 --> 10:20.390
I drink, like a fish. I promise.

10:25.640 --> 10:27.620
This is the only job he could get, Jerry.

10:27.660 --> 10:28.940
If he can't get there…

10:28.980 --> 10:34.260
Laws denying sex offenders housing, jobs,
they've all been upheld as reasonable.

10:35.830 --> 10:38.520
We could always challenge
Megan's law itself.

10:38.560 --> 10:42.200
This judge did seem to suggest
some intolerance for it.

10:44.480 --> 10:46.680
We sort of won, but…

10:46.690 --> 10:48.480
But what?

10:48.710 --> 10:51.440
We'd like to go back into
court just one more time.

10:51.480 --> 10:53.400
Because?

10:53.800 --> 10:56.330
To overturn Megan's law.

10:56.810 --> 10:58.720
So compassionate.

10:58.730 --> 11:00.290
The answer's no.

11:00.300 --> 11:02.630
You're both behind on
assignments from other partners.

11:02.670 --> 11:05.340
You need to think about saving your
own jobs instead of your buddy Joe's.

11:05.380 --> 11:09.480
–Mr Sack—
–There will be no more time
spent on Joseph Washington.

11:09.520 --> 11:11.090
You're done.

11:18.380 --> 11:21.548
Tell me more about this
friend of your mother's.

11:24.310 --> 11:26.440
She looked like you.

11:26.450 --> 11:27.630
She was…

11:27.640 --> 11:31.550
impossibly beautiful…

11:31.960 --> 11:34.070
funny…

11:34.300 --> 11:35.940
intuitive.

11:38.010 --> 11:41.960
She took away my virginity
and never retuned it.

11:41.970 --> 11:43.930
You were 14.

11:46.070 --> 11:49.710
Is it possible your sex
with me is about anger?

11:51.570 --> 11:53.840
I think it's more about napkins.

11:53.850 --> 11:56.040
Uh, control.

11:58.650 --> 12:00.490
The…

12:02.680 --> 12:08.680
the first time you and I kissed,
you touched my leg in a very…

12:10.360 --> 12:14.880
gentle, familiar way, which…

12:17.730 --> 12:21.650
My mother was not an affectionate
woman. I've told you this.

12:21.690 --> 12:24.370
The only act of tenderness
I can recall was,

12:24.410 --> 12:27.430
she would fit me for
trousers, and in so doing,

12:27.470 --> 12:30.800
she would touch my leg
in a way that…

12:31.760 --> 12:34.370
in the absence of
any other attention,

12:34.380 --> 12:39.210
an 8-year-old boy might
interpret as nurturing and loving.

12:39.220 --> 12:43.550
And somehow now you
occasion a series of…

12:45.450 --> 12:49.490
visceral memories
and responses, which…

12:50.620 --> 12:53.960
for some reason seem
to induce green peanuts.

12:55.460 --> 12:57.630
Word salad.

13:26.900 --> 13:30.230
The fact is, Megan's
law is unconstitutional.

13:30.640 --> 13:33.690
It's a punishment that amounts
to a form of double jeopardy.

13:33.730 --> 13:36.410
My client has already
paid his debt to society.

13:36.450 --> 13:37.830
He served his term.

13:37.840 --> 13:39.640
Requiring that he
register post-prison—

13:39.680 --> 13:42.020
Are you seriously going to
challenge an existing law?

13:42.060 --> 13:45.120
This law also denies due process.

13:45.130 --> 13:48.880
My client was afforded no opportunity
to a hearing before having to register.

13:48.920 --> 13:49.660
He got a trial.

13:49.700 --> 13:52.530
But these are post-trial
consequences.

13:52.540 --> 13:55.050
What's more, the law is capricious.

13:55.060 --> 13:57.270
If we punish sex
offenders like this—

13:57.310 --> 14:01.630
making it impossible for them to get
housing, jobs, impossible to live—

14:01.670 --> 14:04.600
they simple won't register,
as many today don't.

14:04.640 --> 14:07.480
We're talking about a crime with
the highest rate of recidivism,

14:07.520 --> 14:11.000
a crime where most offenders
are powerless not to repeat.

14:11.040 --> 14:11.790
They're sick.

14:11.830 --> 14:15.030
Does Megan's law pinch a few
of their civil liberties? Sure.

14:15.070 --> 14:19.030
I say they forfeit those liberties
when they put their hands on a child.

14:19.070 --> 14:20.820
Settle down.

14:21.750 --> 14:24.030
The so-called sex offense
we're talking about here is that

14:24.070 --> 14:27.590
he had sex as a 17 year
old with a girl who was 16.

14:27.600 --> 14:28.450
No, he raped her.

14:28.490 --> 14:29.710
It was consensual!

14:29.720 --> 14:30.870
The jury found otherwise.

14:30.910 --> 14:33.510
All right, all right.
I've heard enough.

14:33.550 --> 14:38.090
Mr Espenson, you make many valid
points, but the bottom line—

14:38.100 --> 14:43.070
I'm not overturning Megan's law, and
good luck finding any judge who will.

14:43.080 --> 14:47.360
Your motion is denied,
and we're adjourned.

14:55.690 --> 14:57.530
I'm curious.

14:57.860 --> 15:02.920
Which of you had the bright idea,
“hey, let's just defy Carl Sack?”

15:02.930 --> 15:05.800
Mr Sack, Joseph Washington is
being punished and vilified—

15:05.840 --> 15:07.440
Yes, we tend to do that with rapists.

15:07.480 --> 15:09.730
He did not rape her.

15:09.740 --> 15:13.050
You may not believe in him, but
you cannot deny my right to,

15:13.090 --> 15:16.060
whether you're a senior
partner or otherwise.

15:17.280 --> 15:20.000
I don't know your buddy Joe, Katie.

15:20.010 --> 15:22.590
I believe in you, or did.

15:23.150 --> 15:24.630
If this woman he was
convicted of raping,

15:24.670 --> 15:28.540
if she was really his girlfriend,
Joe-Bob would know her name.

15:28.580 --> 15:29.630
So?

15:29.640 --> 15:32.330
So a good attorney, which
I had believed you to be,

15:32.370 --> 15:36.100
instead of trying to overturn Megan's
law, would be googling the girl,

15:36.140 --> 15:39.640
finding her, persuading her to recant
in hopes of overturning the conviction.

15:39.680 --> 15:43.480
A good attorney would then simply
unregister him as a sex offender.

15:43.520 --> 15:45.810
That's what good attorneys do.

15:45.820 --> 15:50.860
But since you two are seemingly
not, probably not wise to defy me.

15:52.650 --> 15:54.550
Get out.

15:54.560 --> 15:55.970
Yes, sir.

15:57.090 --> 15:59.030
Thank you, sir.

16:05.380 --> 16:07.190
If the police report is to be believed,

16:07.230 --> 16:09.670
you walked into Sean
Harmon's place of employment,

16:09.710 --> 16:11.590
approached him and shot
him in the forehead.

16:11.630 --> 16:13.900
I said “hello” first.

16:13.910 --> 16:18.960
I wanted to give him a second to
appreciate who was killing him and why.

16:19.880 --> 16:23.930
Do you feel any contrition
whatsoever over this?

16:23.940 --> 16:25.550
Would that help?

16:26.990 --> 16:29.810
I really don't know
what to say here.

16:29.820 --> 16:31.930
Well, the first order of
business, you must get me bail.

16:31.970 --> 16:34.410
I had all my securities
converted into cash,

16:34.450 --> 16:36.990
so I should be able to get
a money order issued today.

16:37.030 --> 16:42.260
If I don't get bail, Alan, the only
images of me will be in this outfit.

16:42.260 --> 16:43.350
We can't have that.

16:43.390 --> 16:46.610
We need to think about
influencing that jury pool.

16:46.650 --> 16:48.820
I'm sure you agree.

16:49.710 --> 16:52.090
You're not sounding very insane.

16:52.100 --> 16:53.760
Well, I'm better now.

16:53.770 --> 16:55.610
It was temporary insanity.

16:55.620 --> 16:56.890
Oh, right.

16:56.900 --> 17:00.440
I'd like you to get dominion of the
room as soon as arraignment begins.

17:00.480 --> 17:03.850
If possible, please preempt
the reading of the charges.

17:03.890 --> 17:05.839
They tend to make good sound bites.

17:05.880 --> 17:10.150
And also, please don't forget in your bail
argument to state the obvious— this is important.

17:10.190 --> 17:11.970
–The obvious?
–Yes.

17:12.780 --> 17:14.780
He had it coming.

17:15.109 --> 17:17.900
I'd like you to be
passionate about that.

17:18.500 --> 17:20.980
The jury will be listening.

17:24.710 --> 17:28.569
Case number 6-2-4-5,
Commonwealth vs Patrice kelly

17:28.580 --> 17:33.290
on a charge of first-degree murder—
–Alan Shore for the defendant,
along with my colleague Denny Crane.

17:33.330 --> 17:35.900
We'd like to enter our appearance
and a plea of not guilty.

17:35.940 --> 17:39.630
We'll waive reading of these charges
which, quite frankly, shouldn't be read at all.

17:39.670 --> 17:43.450
What kind of society is this that
hauls in a grieving mother who—

17:43.490 --> 17:47.010
We only haul in grieving mothers
who shoot people, counselor.

17:47.050 --> 17:47.630
Yes, your honor.

17:47.670 --> 17:49.560
If we could proceed
to bail, my client—

17:49.600 --> 17:52.030
Committed cold-blooded
murder and bail is not—

17:52.070 --> 17:53.600
Her blood temperature
was never taken,

17:53.640 --> 17:57.100
and bail is a function of flight
risk and danger to society.

17:57.140 --> 17:58.640
Patrice Kelly poses neither.

17:58.680 --> 18:00.050
She executes people.

18:00.060 --> 18:01.500
Only the ones who murder her children,

18:01.540 --> 18:03.590
and since my client is
now fresh out of kids,

18:03.630 --> 18:06.300
I would submit that there's nobody
left for Patrice Kelly to shoot.

18:06.340 --> 18:10.610
Mr Shore, your tone doesn't seem
to grasp the severity of the matter.

18:10.650 --> 18:13.330
Do you think we're all gathered
here for a good snicker?

18:13.370 --> 18:14.580
No, I do not, your honor.

18:14.620 --> 18:16.670
We're gathered here because
this woman's only daughter

18:16.710 --> 18:19.380
was beaten to death by a
man of considerable wealth

18:19.420 --> 18:21.660
who was able to hire
people with all the skills

18:21.700 --> 18:25.970
and resources necessary to manufacture
a temporary insanity defense.

18:26.010 --> 18:30.170
The best kind of insanity defense because
with that one you get both the acquittal

18:30.210 --> 18:33.620
and your walking papers so long as
you show that the insanity has passed,

18:33.660 --> 18:37.280
which his lawyers of considerable
skills and resources were able to do.

18:37.320 --> 18:40.940
Sean Harmon walked out of
that courtroom a free man.

18:40.950 --> 18:44.480
He bludgeoned her daughter
to death with a vodka bottle.

18:44.520 --> 18:45.720
He did not go to prison.

18:45.760 --> 18:47.170
He did not go to a hospital.

18:47.210 --> 18:50.600
And my client, a grieving mother,
could not allow for that injustice.

18:50.640 --> 18:53.420
She is not a threat
to society at large.

18:53.430 --> 18:56.330
She's not going to run
because, frankly, why should she?

18:56.370 --> 18:58.950
Sean Harmon viciously
killed her daughter.

18:58.990 --> 19:00.710
Sean Harmon had it coming.

19:00.720 --> 19:05.100
He made her crazy, and he
got exactly what he deserved.

19:06.520 --> 19:08.680
Bail is set for $1 million.

19:08.690 --> 19:10.670
We'll set a conference for scheduling.

19:10.710 --> 19:12.480
–Defense is ready now.
–What?

19:12.520 --> 19:13.750
There's no discovery to speak of.

19:13.790 --> 19:16.640
My client walked in and
shot somebody, allegedly.

19:16.680 --> 19:19.200
Do you mean you're entering
a straight plea of not guilty?

19:19.240 --> 19:20.030
No, no, no, no.

19:20.070 --> 19:22.970
At this time, we'd like to give
notice of our affirmative defense.

19:23.010 --> 19:24.790
Which is?

19:24.800 --> 19:27.130
Temporary insanity.

19:35.850 --> 19:37.940
Is it wise to proceed right to trial?

19:37.980 --> 19:41.510
There was public outrage when Sean Harmon
was acquitted of killing your daughter.

19:41.550 --> 19:45.070
We want to exploit that
while it's still outrageous.

19:45.080 --> 19:47.590
I'd also like a black
attorney if you've got one.

19:47.630 --> 19:49.740
There will be african-american jurors.

19:49.780 --> 19:53.460
I may be portrayed as the rich, white
blue blood looking to buy a verdict,

19:53.500 --> 19:55.660
so we should probably color up.

19:55.670 --> 19:58.570
And on that note,
Denny Crane is out.

19:58.580 --> 20:02.530
I don't need the image of corporate,
gluttonous wealth sitting next to me.

20:02.570 --> 20:05.160
We should schedule a press
conference as soon as possible.

20:05.200 --> 20:07.490
Since you may not want
to put me on the stand,

20:07.530 --> 20:12.710
I suggest I tell my story to the
media, free from cross-examination.

20:13.720 --> 20:15.840
You scare me.

20:23.460 --> 20:25.220
hi. I'm Gwen Richards.

20:25.230 --> 20:26.510
Can I help you?
–Yes.

20:26.550 --> 20:27.790
Thank you.

20:27.800 --> 20:28.820
My name's Katie Lloyd.

20:28.860 --> 20:31.890
I represent a man
named Joseph Washington.

20:34.010 --> 20:38.300
I'm guessing from your expression
you know who I'm talking about.

20:38.620 --> 20:40.790
May we speak in private?

20:42.500 --> 20:45.640
As I understand Joseph,
the sex was consensual,

20:45.650 --> 20:49.090
but you maintained otherwise so as
not to incur the wrath of your father.

20:49.130 --> 20:51.050
That's not true.

20:51.060 --> 20:53.230
The sex was not consensual.

20:53.240 --> 20:54.260
He overpowered you?

20:54.300 --> 20:56.620
He pressured me.

20:56.630 --> 20:58.880
I was 16. I was afraid to say no.

20:58.890 --> 21:02.330
I didn't feel like I had a choice.

21:05.050 --> 21:07.370
Ms Lloyd, I can't help you.

21:07.950 --> 21:12.660
Plus, this is something that
I tried to put behind me.

21:13.020 --> 21:15.950
I have a life, a family. I…

21:19.990 --> 21:22.110
I'm not a psychologist.

21:22.120 --> 21:26.674
But I suspect if you weren't raped,
you'll never put this behind you.

21:27.010 --> 21:30.240
A man served six years in prison.

21:30.250 --> 21:34.330
He must live what's left of his shattered
life as a registered sex offender.

21:34.370 --> 21:38.600
–And— and if you're a person of conscience—
–I need you to leave.

21:38.640 --> 21:41.790
I have to get back to work, and I…

21:41.800 --> 21:44.230
can't help you.

21:45.880 --> 21:48.350
I need you to leave.

22:03.500 --> 22:08.490
Need to talk, specifically
about your insanity.

22:08.500 --> 22:09.740
Can we do that?

22:09.750 --> 22:12.860
My thought is it should
be a dissociative state.

22:12.900 --> 22:15.530
They tend to be temporary
in nature.

22:16.060 --> 22:18.680
What would be the precipitating factor?

22:18.690 --> 22:21.790
It was a full month after
Sean Harmon's acquittal.

22:21.830 --> 22:25.520
So what was it that…
sent you around the bend?

22:25.850 --> 22:27.190
God.

22:27.700 --> 22:29.090
God?

22:29.100 --> 22:30.570
God.

22:30.580 --> 22:32.560
He spoke to me.

22:32.570 --> 22:34.200
And what did God say?

22:34.210 --> 22:36.050
“Shoot him in the head.”

22:36.060 --> 22:37.140
I see.

22:37.150 --> 22:40.930
The thing is, Patrice, for a jury to
let you go, they have to like you.

22:40.970 --> 22:43.390
That won't happen if they think
you're trying to fool them.

22:43.430 --> 22:45.390
So far I'm not sure I like you.

22:45.430 --> 22:47.550
What's your point?

22:48.670 --> 22:50.220
Did God speak to you?

22:50.230 --> 22:51.770
Yes.

22:51.780 --> 22:54.090
And his exact words were?

22:54.100 --> 22:56.510
“Shoot him in the head.”

22:57.780 --> 22:59.920
We might subpœna
her. Maybe under oath—

22:59.960 --> 23:02.410
I mean, I'm not sure she's
willing to risk perjury.

23:02.450 --> 23:05.920
But that's exactly what she risked
at the trial when she convicted him.

23:05.960 --> 23:07.280
I mean, if what you're saying is true,

23:07.320 --> 23:12.250
it's probably the threat of perjury that's kept her
from setting the record straight all these years.

23:12.290 --> 23:15.960
It's just— there must be
something else we can do.

23:16.850 --> 23:19.710
Excuse me, Katie, Jerry.

23:20.450 --> 23:22.030
Whitney, Alan Shore.

23:22.040 --> 23:23.756
We haven't officially met.

23:23.760 --> 23:26.790
How do you feel about murder trials?

23:26.800 --> 23:28.040
Take 'em or leave 'em.

23:28.080 --> 23:29.980
I need you to take one
as second chair.

23:30.020 --> 23:30.740
Would you come with me?

23:30.780 --> 23:34.580
Okay, if that's a line, um,
you're too old and too fat.

23:34.970 --> 23:37.050
I'm not too old.

23:37.780 --> 23:40.400
Please… leave the beer.

23:52.070 --> 23:53.750
Gwen?

23:56.500 --> 23:59.190
Tell me what I need to do.

24:14.950 --> 24:16.470
Tell me again why
we're in this court?

24:16.510 --> 24:18.490
This is the court where you
were convicted of the rape,

24:18.530 --> 24:20.410
and therefore, the only
one that can overturn it.

24:20.450 --> 24:23.530
If successful, then we
go back to Middletown.

24:27.030 --> 24:29.270
Please don't make her any
more uncomfortable than she is.

24:29.310 --> 24:31.270
We don't want her leaving.

24:31.720 --> 24:33.430
All rise.

24:33.440 --> 24:36.146
In re: Commonwealth
vs Joseph Washington,

24:36.150 --> 24:39.330
the honorable William Howe
presiding, this court is in session.

24:39.370 --> 24:40.750
Good morning, your honor.

24:40.790 --> 24:41.950
My name's Katie Lloyd.

24:41.990 --> 24:46.160
I am before you today with attorney Jerry
Espenson representing Joseph Washington,

24:46.200 --> 24:49.430
who was convicted before you
in 1985 on the charge of rape.

24:49.470 --> 24:50.980
Yes, I've read your papers.

24:51.020 --> 24:54.300
Your honor, I have no idea if there has
been any deal cut between Mr Washington

24:54.340 --> 24:55.410
and the witness
to effect any—

24:55.450 --> 24:59.020
There's been no such deal, your honor, which
is so attested to in Ms Richards' affidavit,

24:59.060 --> 24:59.990
and I would submit,

25:00.030 --> 25:04.170
since the rape case against Joseph Washington
was based solely and entirely on her testimony—

25:04.210 --> 25:06.130
Is Ms Richards with us today?

25:06.140 --> 25:08.010
She is, your honor.

25:08.020 --> 25:11.270
Ms Richards, step up here, please.

25:20.600 --> 25:24.510
You claimed Mr Washington
forcibly raped you.

25:24.520 --> 25:27.760
You're saying now
that was not the case?

25:27.770 --> 25:29.100
Yes, sir.

25:29.110 --> 25:31.460
Why would you say he did?

25:33.630 --> 25:36.510
My father walked in on us and…

25:37.720 --> 25:42.840
I claimed that Mr Washington
raped me to avoid punishment.

25:44.860 --> 25:48.800
The sex I had with
Mr Washington was consensual.

25:51.260 --> 25:55.840
You realize the prosecution most
likely will charge you now with perjury?

25:55.880 --> 25:59.660
Yes, I have consulted a lawyer. I
know what I'm exposing myself to here.

25:59.700 --> 26:03.800
I find this revelation a
little disgusting, Ms Richards.

26:03.810 --> 26:07.140
In addition to sending this man to
prison for something he didn't do,

26:07.180 --> 26:09.770
perhaps destroying his life irreparably,

26:09.810 --> 26:14.260
you continued to let that rape
conviction hang over this man

26:14.270 --> 26:16.220
while he was being tried for murder.

26:16.260 --> 26:17.970
Yes, your honor.

26:20.380 --> 26:24.010
I will never be able to give
back what I took from him.

26:25.790 --> 26:29.550
I cannot punish him
any longer, your honor.

26:30.270 --> 26:32.910
He did not rape me.

26:34.070 --> 26:36.770
I lied.

26:39.330 --> 26:40.780
Okay.

26:41.810 --> 26:45.890
Given that the prosecution's
primary witness has recanted,

26:45.900 --> 26:51.220
I am vacating this conviction
pending further proceedings.

26:51.230 --> 26:54.860
An arrest warrant is hereby
issued for Ms Richards.

26:54.870 --> 26:57.050
Please take her into custody.

27:14.940 --> 27:17.180
He hasn't been cleared. The
case is still officially pending.

27:17.220 --> 27:18.560
But the conviction was vacated,

27:18.600 --> 27:22.758
which means he doesn't have to
be registered as a sex offender.

27:23.430 --> 27:25.170
All right, settle down.

27:25.180 --> 27:29.550
Your honor, we don't know the circumstances
surrounding Ms Richards sudden decision
to recant her testimony.

27:29.590 --> 27:30.500
Mr McDougal,

27:30.510 --> 27:34.670
unless you show me some evidence to
cast suspicion on these circumstances,

27:34.710 --> 27:35.960
my hands are tied.

27:35.970 --> 27:38.940
He doesn't stand before me
as a convicted sex offender.

27:38.980 --> 27:44.062
I therefore order you to take his name
off the registered sex offenders list.

27:46.920 --> 27:49.050
All right. Quiet.

27:49.060 --> 27:50.640
He is to be afforded all the
rights and privileges that

27:50.680 --> 27:56.560
we typically extend to citizens living
in what we like to call a free society.

27:56.570 --> 27:58.450
That's all.

28:00.930 --> 28:02.400
–So I can drive?
–You can drive.

28:02.440 --> 28:04.760
And you should be able to qualify for housing.
–Yes.

28:04.800 --> 28:06.130
You still have your job, right?

28:06.170 --> 28:08.120
My boss says I did.

28:08.670 --> 28:09.860
Thank you.

28:10.420 --> 28:11.380
Thank you.

28:12.020 --> 28:13.750
Excuse me.

28:14.080 --> 28:16.050
I'm very sorry to intrude.

28:16.350 --> 28:19.330
Mr Washington, my name
is Lauren Delhorn,

28:19.340 --> 28:22.980
and I was raised in the town of
Middletown, where I still reside.

28:23.020 --> 28:28.280
I realize you've done your time in
prison and paid your debt to society.

28:28.290 --> 28:30.100
But, sir…

28:31.070 --> 28:34.330
we do not want you in Middletown.

28:34.340 --> 28:38.720
This is a safe town where people
still go to mass on Friday nights.

28:38.760 --> 28:43.470
Please show us the respect that
you'd like others to extend to you.

28:44.520 --> 28:47.360
Go live somewhere else.

28:55.180 --> 28:56.840
They mean well.

28:57.390 --> 28:59.740
They just want to raise
their children and…

28:59.780 --> 29:02.930
I suppose, not have to
look over their shoulders.

29:02.970 --> 29:07.220
But… it probably would be
best if you went elsewhere.

29:26.100 --> 29:27.630
You seem upset.

29:30.220 --> 29:33.590
<i>As Ms Kelly took time out for a
Rod Stewart concert last night,</i>

29:33.630 --> 29:35.420
<i>she stopped to talk to reporters.</i>

29:35.460 --> 29:37.930
<i>The truth is, in the eight months
following my daughter's death,</i>

29:37.970 --> 29:39.270
<i>I never went anywhere.</i>

29:39.310 --> 29:42.460
<i>It was as if that man
killed me as well as Hannah.</i>

29:42.500 --> 29:43.600
<i>Well, he didn't kill me.</i>

29:43.640 --> 29:45.530
<i>In fact, it worked out
quite the opposite.</i>

29:45.570 --> 29:47.630
<i>And now that my daughter
can finally rest in peace,</i>

29:47.670 --> 29:51.300
<i>I thought, maybe I can
live life for both of us.</i>

29:52.580 --> 29:54.880
And what exactly was
the thinking here?

29:54.920 --> 29:56.620
I want the jury to know me.

29:56.660 --> 29:59.120
It's more difficult to
imprison people you care about.

29:59.160 --> 30:02.520
And you think you engendered sympathy with
that little performance, going to a rock concert?

30:02.560 --> 30:04.320
Let me tell you something, Patrice.

30:04.360 --> 30:08.420
If the jury detects some twisted
sense of joy on your part—

30:08.430 --> 30:10.800
What you saw was empowerment,
not joy.

30:10.840 --> 30:12.740
As for the concert, it was Rod Stewart.

30:12.780 --> 30:14.070
Completely age appropriate.

30:14.110 --> 30:15.960
Jury's not gonna know you, lady.

30:16.000 --> 30:20.340
It all comes down to a collection of
impressions, first ones getting the most play.

30:20.380 --> 30:22.330
You wanna know mine?
–No.

30:24.980 --> 30:27.010
I'm sorry. That was rude.

30:27.020 --> 30:29.590
Empowerment's no defense
to first-degree murder.

30:29.630 --> 30:31.690
I'm told God speaks to you.

30:31.700 --> 30:33.340
Best you keep talking to him.

30:33.380 --> 30:35.900
That we can make work.

30:37.880 --> 30:39.730
I like her.

30:55.270 --> 30:58.500
I've never had a beer in
the middle of the day before.

30:58.540 --> 31:01.720
Well, Winston Churchill
used to drink in victory

31:01.730 --> 31:05.060
because he deserved it, and in
defeat because he needed it.

31:05.100 --> 31:08.340
Well, I don't know how
much of a victory it was.

31:08.350 --> 31:10.660
At least he can get to his job anyway.

31:10.700 --> 31:14.462
Yeah, until the town pressures
his employers to fire him.

31:16.080 --> 31:18.120
This is Katie Lloyd.

31:19.470 --> 31:20.870
What?

31:22.310 --> 31:24.680
When? When did this happen?

31:29.910 --> 31:31.510
Yes.

31:35.930 --> 31:37.700
What's wrong?

31:37.910 --> 31:39.730
He's dead.

31:39.740 --> 31:41.280
What?

31:41.670 --> 31:44.090
Joseph. He's dead.

31:51.510 --> 31:54.860
We found no identification, but
we're pretty sure it's him.

31:54.900 --> 31:57.690
I really appreciate you coming down.

31:59.210 --> 32:01.620
Are… you okay?

32:03.420 --> 32:05.520
I can do this.

32:06.880 --> 32:08.440
I'll do it.

32:24.800 --> 32:26.760
It's him.

32:36.310 --> 32:39.300
Whoever did it, we'll catch 'em.

32:54.780 --> 32:56.450
Inseam is 29.

32:57.230 --> 32:58.490
Let's do your waist.

32:58.530 --> 33:01.850
I really don't know what you're
trying to accomplish, Lorraine.

33:01.890 --> 33:03.030
This could desensitize you.

33:03.070 --> 33:04.520
It's not working.

33:04.530 --> 33:07.550
Unless by, uh, desensitize
you mean harden.

33:07.560 --> 33:09.140
Are you feeling
more comfortable, Alan?

33:09.180 --> 33:10.380
I am.

33:10.390 --> 33:12.320
What are you, some kind of nymph?

33:12.360 --> 33:13.930
Whitney, how are you today?

33:13.970 --> 33:15.550
Yeah, yeah, I hate to intrude.

33:15.590 --> 33:19.960
But did you see the statement our temporary
psycho gave to the police after she shot this guy?

33:20.000 --> 33:20.590
I did.

33:20.600 --> 33:24.740
She was methodical, reflective,
deliberate, organized.

33:24.750 --> 33:26.530
How do we make insanity with that?

33:26.570 --> 33:27.610
From scratch.

33:27.620 --> 33:30.630
Everything tastes better that way.

33:30.850 --> 33:32.400
What am I missing?

33:32.410 --> 33:33.690
Nothing, Whitney.

33:33.700 --> 33:36.550
As you said yourself,
we go with God.

33:49.340 --> 33:54.520
We have a client who was just slapped with a
T.R.O involving some delicate copyright issues.

33:54.560 --> 33:56.600
I'm gonna need both of you to
hop on the research immediately.

33:56.640 --> 33:58.430
It may be a late night.

34:11.400 --> 34:13.580
Look at me, Katie.

34:18.739 --> 34:23.760
Older lawyers typically tell the younger
ones not to get too close to the client.

34:23.800 --> 34:26.389
Good advice for the most part.

34:26.670 --> 34:32.500
But Mr Washington was lucky that
he had a lawyer who did get close.

34:32.810 --> 34:35.280
Because of you,
he died an innocent man.

34:35.320 --> 34:37.489
You gave him his name back,

34:37.820 --> 34:41.530
and I would suspect a little faith.

34:42.280 --> 34:47.440
He died without a single person in
the world giving a damn about him.

34:47.630 --> 34:50.639
That's not true. Is it?

35:08.400 --> 35:10.490
I'm going to church.

36:05.030 --> 36:06.310
I beg your pardon.

36:06.320 --> 36:11.534
I was wondering if might say just a word
or two in memory of Joseph Washington.

36:14.470 --> 36:15.920
All right.

36:25.290 --> 36:28.260
I'm terribly sorry to disturb
your evening service.

36:28.300 --> 36:33.780
But a man, Joseph Washington—
maybe some of you knew him—

36:34.390 --> 36:37.640
passed away today, and, uh,

36:38.000 --> 36:41.330
well, his last place of
residence was Middletown.

36:41.710 --> 36:44.410
He didn't really have
many people in his life.

36:44.450 --> 36:46.490
He— he spent a great
deal of time in prison,

36:46.530 --> 36:49.566
and when he got
out, well, as you can imagine,

36:49.570 --> 36:53.270
not very many communities
were inclined to embrace him.

36:53.280 --> 36:55.720
He was excited about
coming to Middletown

36:55.760 --> 36:58.620
because he'd heard
it was a kind town,

36:58.970 --> 37:01.520
a community of tolerant people.

37:02.790 --> 37:04.890
Not all of you welcomed him.

37:06.440 --> 37:08.770
Some of you thought him a murderer…

37:08.970 --> 37:10.740
though he was not.

37:11.560 --> 37:14.530
Some of you thought he was a rapist…

37:15.240 --> 37:17.490
though he was not.

37:18.430 --> 37:21.270
Some of you thought him unfeeling…

37:22.290 --> 37:24.260
uh, though he was not.

37:27.100 --> 37:30.740
Many of you have families and
quite rightly want to protect them.

37:30.780 --> 37:33.350
You don't want people
coming here out of prison.

37:33.390 --> 37:36.030
But you might wonder,
where are they to go?

37:36.070 --> 37:39.320
With over two million people
currently in american prisons,

37:39.360 --> 37:42.950
with about 700,000 due to be
released by the end of next year,

37:42.990 --> 37:45.130
where are they to go?

37:45.540 --> 37:48.170
And if we deny them
housing and jobs,

37:48.180 --> 37:52.850
if we treat them with nothing but
scorn, what's to become of them?

37:55.100 --> 37:58.664
I apologize. I didn't come
here to lecture so much as…

37:59.190 --> 38:03.110
well, when a human being
dies, he should be prayed for.

38:03.680 --> 38:06.260
And since Joseph
last lived among you,

38:07.490 --> 38:09.730
please let us pray.

38:20.720 --> 38:22.040
Oh, Lord…

38:22.050 --> 38:26.510
we humbly pray thee to show
mercy on the soul of Joseph,

38:26.520 --> 38:29.780
who you have commanded to
pass out of this world…

38:30.300 --> 38:33.470
a world which was
often not kind to him.

38:34.570 --> 38:39.620
We pray thee might place him
in a place of peace and light,

38:40.090 --> 38:44.270
of goodwill… love
and forgiveness.

38:45.240 --> 38:46.320
Amen.

38:46.330 --> 38:47.590
Amen.

39:22.340 --> 39:26.640
You can't go in with “God told
me to shoot him as a defense.”

39:27.170 --> 39:28.580
Why not?

39:28.590 --> 39:32.390
I don't doubt that God talked
to her, but he wouldn't say “shoot.”

39:32.430 --> 39:33.460
The devil would say that.

39:33.500 --> 39:36.700
And— and juries
don't like devils.

39:36.710 --> 39:37.730
Except me.

39:37.740 --> 39:40.300
That's right. They love you.

39:42.780 --> 39:46.080
I must say, I feel a little
bit like the devil, Denny.

39:46.120 --> 39:50.160
I mean, I don't believe for a
second that woman was insane.

39:50.170 --> 39:52.980
It was as premeditated as can be.

39:52.990 --> 39:55.140
Yet I'm excited to help
her get away with it.

39:55.180 --> 39:57.360
Well, that's because the bastard
had it coming, like she said.

39:57.400 --> 40:00.570
He deserved to be shot
right between the eyes.

40:00.580 --> 40:05.080
And you have trouble admitting
to yourself that deep down,

40:05.090 --> 40:06.880
you're for the death penalty.

40:06.920 --> 40:09.690
An eye for an eye.
Boom. Feels good.

40:10.440 --> 40:13.740
–I'm not for the death penalty.
–Mm, yes, you are.

40:14.030 --> 40:16.800
It's not politically
correct, it's not evolved,

40:16.840 --> 40:19.780
it's not learned—
spare me.

40:19.790 --> 40:23.100
The guy beat the girl to death.

40:23.590 --> 40:26.070
I'd have shot him
in the balls first.

40:26.280 --> 40:29.840
An eye for an eye.

40:30.590 --> 40:32.080
Dead.

40:32.830 --> 40:36.250
That's what you believe,
deep down. So does God.

40:38.480 --> 40:40.350
What?

40:43.160 --> 40:46.560
–Did you hear Joseph Washington was killed?
–Yeah

40:46.570 --> 40:47.920
Terrible.

40:50.130 --> 40:54.222
I used to think hope was something
that belonged to everybody.

40:54.580 --> 41:00.080
Put limits on guns
and butter but hope…

41:01.330 --> 41:03.540
Springs a kernel.

41:06.110 --> 41:07.750
Old farmer's saying.

41:07.760 --> 41:09.280
Growing corn?

41:09.290 --> 41:11.400
Hope springs a kernel.

41:11.410 --> 41:13.310
Haven't you heard that?

41:14.140 --> 41:16.560
Springs eternal.

41:18.040 --> 41:21.890
Hope… springs eternal.

41:26.640 --> 41:28.470
It didn't for Joseph Washington.

41:28.510 --> 41:30.890
Or if it did, it didn't matter.

41:32.140 --> 41:34.690
Two things this world
has too much of:

41:34.700 --> 41:36.820
suffering and…

41:38.560 --> 41:40.090
corn.

41:40.790 --> 41:43.610
I think it is hope springs a kernel.

41:45.480 --> 41:47.450
You may be right.
