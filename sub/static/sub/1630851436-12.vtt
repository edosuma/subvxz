00:08.517 --> 00:10.719
- As we say goodbye
to sweet George,

00:10.786 --> 00:14.189
let's remember the better days
when he would sit in his bowl,

00:14.256 --> 00:17.025
and kinda blink.
Guy loved to blink, didn't he?

00:17.092 --> 00:19.428
- He loved to blink.
Yes, he did.

00:19.528 --> 00:21.230
- Nelson, why don't you
do the honors

00:21.296 --> 00:25.067
and shove all of his personal
belongings down the toilet?

00:26.702 --> 00:28.136
- It's not going down.
- Use your foot.

00:28.237 --> 00:29.605
- I'm not putting my foot
in your toilet, Tom.

00:29.705 --> 00:30.973
- Nelson, put your foot
in the toilet.

00:31.073 --> 00:32.541
It's a funeral.
Show some respect.

00:32.608 --> 00:34.142
- My mom would kill me
if I ruin these socks.

00:34.243 --> 00:35.544
- All right, fine. I'll do it.

00:35.611 --> 00:37.112
- Don't splash, man!
You're splashing me!

00:37.212 --> 00:38.814
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
What's going on here?

00:38.914 --> 00:40.315
- Mom, we're giving George
a funeral.

00:40.415 --> 00:41.783
- George died?

00:41.883 --> 00:43.885
We got him three days ago, Tom.
He cost 12 bucks.

00:43.952 --> 00:45.454
- Excuse me. Sorry.

00:45.554 --> 00:47.155
Should I keep playing
the flute through this part?

00:47.256 --> 00:49.091
- Keep playing. It's beaut--
it's really beautiful.

00:49.157 --> 00:51.493
- Dakota, take it away
from your mouth.

00:51.593 --> 00:54.096
- Dakota, please.
- Dakota, no more.

00:54.162 --> 00:55.897
- Oh, my God.
This is the worst funeral ever.

00:55.964 --> 00:57.966
- The funeral's off 'cause
we're going to the pet store

00:58.066 --> 00:59.434
and we're gonna get
our money back.

00:59.501 --> 01:00.602
- Nelson, get her out.

01:00.669 --> 01:02.004
- Nelson, don't.
- Ow!

01:02.104 --> 01:03.572
- Oh, my God. Stop. Don't.
Give me the fish.

01:03.639 --> 01:06.174
- Give it.
- What is happening here?

01:06.942 --> 01:08.510
- Other than putting your foot
in the toilet,

01:08.610 --> 01:10.746
this was
a very tasteful ceremony.

01:14.983 --> 01:17.853
- Hi, we came here
and we were sold a faulty fish.

01:17.953 --> 01:19.821
And, uh, the fish passed.

01:19.921 --> 01:22.357
So if you just want to credit
that back to the credit card

01:22.457 --> 01:23.692
or give us some cash.

01:23.792 --> 01:25.093
- Sorry, can't do it.
- What's this?

01:25.160 --> 01:26.628
- Can I interest you
in a new fish?

01:26.695 --> 01:28.664
- New fish? No.
- We need a full refund.

01:28.764 --> 01:30.032
- Yeah, here's the thing.

01:30.132 --> 01:32.534
The fish was healthy
three days ago.

01:32.634 --> 01:35.170
He was swimming. He was happy.
Now he's been whacked.

01:35.270 --> 01:36.672
- Whacked?
- Hang on!

01:36.772 --> 01:38.774
Are you trying to say
my son murdered George?

01:38.840 --> 01:42.177
- As corporate policy,
we don't say "murder" but yes,

01:42.277 --> 01:43.712
I believe
your son murdered the fish.

01:43.812 --> 01:45.881
- I found the body.
No one's denying that.

01:45.981 --> 01:47.716
- How dare you say
my son, Tom--

01:47.816 --> 01:49.151
- Your son is
standing there, ma'am,

01:49.217 --> 01:50.786
with a blank expression
on his face.

01:50.852 --> 01:52.554
That's what murderers do.

01:52.654 --> 01:54.890
- His face is always blank.
He's a thinker.

01:54.990 --> 01:56.625
- Is--is there
a problem over here?

01:56.692 --> 01:59.661
- This "lady"--
- What? Lady in quotes?

01:59.728 --> 02:02.064
- Is trying to return
a dead fish?

02:02.164 --> 02:03.465
And she's giving me loads of

02:03.532 --> 02:05.167
'tude
because I'm not having it.

02:05.233 --> 02:07.536
- All right, calm down.
Thanks, Casey. I've got this.

02:07.636 --> 02:08.904
Sorry you're upset

02:09.004 --> 02:10.872
and I apologize
for what just happened.

02:10.972 --> 02:13.241
I'm not gonna try
to sell you another fish.

02:13.342 --> 02:14.643
- Okay, thank you.

02:14.710 --> 02:16.912
- But what are your feelings
on gerbils?

02:17.012 --> 02:19.648
- No, there's no way
I'm spending more money.

02:19.715 --> 02:21.850
- Come on, Mom. He's so cute.
-

02:21.917 --> 02:25.020
- Yeah, come on, Mom.
Come on, Mom.

02:25.087 --> 02:27.489
- Oh. We can't afford it.

02:27.556 --> 02:29.858
- Oh.
I guess you don't love me?

02:29.925 --> 02:32.928
- Oh, no, Tom.
Do not make sad Tom face.

02:33.028 --> 02:35.530
- You're still a good mom.
Some mothers just care

02:35.597 --> 02:38.200
about money more
than their child's happiness.

02:38.266 --> 02:40.602
- Fine!

02:40.702 --> 02:42.337
What's the cheapest gerbil
you've got?

02:42.404 --> 02:46.742
- That would be
a senior gerbil for $75.

02:46.842 --> 02:49.578
- $75?
Are you out of your mind?

02:49.678 --> 02:52.714
- I'm not. Casey has issues,
but I'm doing fine.

02:52.781 --> 02:55.450
- Ugh. You know what?
Fine. Wrap him up.

02:55.550 --> 02:57.185
- Um, we don't say

02:57.252 --> 02:59.421
"wrap them up"
like it's a burrito.

02:59.521 --> 03:00.789
- Casey, I've got this.

03:00.889 --> 03:04.593
At Pet Depot, we happily
wrap up all the animals.

03:05.927 --> 03:07.462
- All right, Larry,
play time's over.

03:07.562 --> 03:09.231
Take a load off. Take a nap.

03:09.297 --> 03:12.300
Make yourself comfortable.
Let's circle back later.

03:12.401 --> 03:13.735
- Hey kid, is your mom around?

03:13.802 --> 03:15.871
That toilet
is completely destroyed.

03:15.937 --> 03:17.773
- You know, she doesn't talk
to plumbers any more.

03:17.873 --> 03:19.875
She told me to-to tell you
to shut up and fix the toilet.

03:19.941 --> 03:21.243
- What's this?
- My dad was a plumber.

03:21.309 --> 03:22.778
It's a sore subject.
- Yes, yes, yes.

03:22.878 --> 03:25.113
Okay, now I know
who we're dealing with here.

03:25.213 --> 03:27.482
- Whoa! Who's this
cute little guy?

03:27.582 --> 03:29.117
- My gerbil, Larry. He's 82.

03:29.217 --> 03:30.952
- Hi, Larry.
What a cutie you are.

03:31.052 --> 03:32.487
- Isn't he cute?
- Yeah, very cute!

03:32.587 --> 03:34.623
Well, this is a little surprise
for me in my day.

03:34.723 --> 03:36.158
- I love him.
- Hi, Larry!

03:36.258 --> 03:38.226
Too bad you have
to live your life in captivity.

03:38.293 --> 03:40.162
You're like a little prisoner,
aren't ya, Larry?

03:40.262 --> 03:41.496
- Prisoner? What's this?

03:41.596 --> 03:43.131
- What'd ya do?
What crime did you do?

03:43.231 --> 03:44.499
- No. He's my pet gerbil.

03:44.599 --> 03:46.668
- I'm just saying his cage
is like a prison.

03:46.768 --> 03:48.970
- Nah, nah, nah. They call
this the "Deluxe Cabana."

03:49.070 --> 03:50.639
It's like he's on vacation.

03:50.739 --> 03:52.841
- When you go on vacation,
where do you--where do you go?

03:52.941 --> 03:54.309
A little room?

03:54.409 --> 03:56.178
- We don't--I don't go
in a little room, no.

03:56.278 --> 03:57.646
- Got'cha, got'cha, got'cha.

03:57.746 --> 04:00.015
You know, I'm just
a simple plumber, "shut up

04:00.115 --> 04:02.150
and get in the bathroom,"
but if you ask me,

04:02.250 --> 04:04.619
we don't have the right
to treat animals as property.

04:04.686 --> 04:06.521
- Well, you know,
he was on sale, so--

04:06.621 --> 04:08.190
- You think selling
a living creature,

04:08.290 --> 04:09.825
does that sound
morally fine to you?

04:09.925 --> 04:11.693
I don't know what your morals
are in this house.

04:11.793 --> 04:13.195
- Selling creatures?

04:13.295 --> 04:15.197
Yeah, you can buy gerbils.
People do that, right?

04:15.297 --> 04:18.967
- Hmm. How would you like
to live in a little teeny cage?

04:21.102 --> 04:22.971
- To be honest, I think I would
thrive in that environment.

04:23.038 --> 04:24.539
- H-how about we take him
for a little spin then?

04:24.639 --> 04:26.374
- What do you mean?
- How about you

04:26.475 --> 04:28.009
pretend you're Larry
for one minute?

04:28.109 --> 04:29.611
- No. Aren't you here
to fix the toilet?

04:29.678 --> 04:31.046
What's happening?
Oh, no. I don't want to get--

04:31.146 --> 04:32.447
No, I'm not getting in there.
No, no.

04:32.514 --> 04:34.149
Please.
- Come on. Hop in here.

04:34.216 --> 04:35.650
- No, get back in the bathroom.
This is too much now.

04:35.717 --> 04:37.118
- Come on. It'll be fun.

04:37.185 --> 04:38.887
Pretend you're Larry.
- This is getting weird.

04:38.987 --> 04:40.555
- Come on, just
get in there. It'll be fun.

04:40.655 --> 04:42.123
- That's not
a reassuring voice.

04:42.190 --> 04:43.124
Oh! Hey, hey, hey, hey!

04:43.191 --> 04:44.392
- Ah, there we go.

04:44.493 --> 04:45.894
- Did you lock the door?
What's happening?

04:45.994 --> 04:48.063
- If I could change
one young person's mind,

04:48.163 --> 04:49.998
I've done my good deed
for the day.

04:50.065 --> 04:53.068
And I <i>always</i> do my good deed
for the day.

04:53.168 --> 04:55.637
- I think you oversold
how much fun this was gonna be.

04:55.704 --> 04:57.906
You're not leaving, are you?
What's happening out there?

04:58.006 --> 04:59.975
Larry, what's he doing?

05:08.383 --> 05:11.086
- Hi, uh, I need to reschedule
my neck rub.

05:11.186 --> 05:14.155
My son's been missing
for an insane amount of hours.

05:14.222 --> 05:17.893
And it just feels weird
to get a massage right now.

05:17.993 --> 05:20.862
- Mom! Let me out!
- Tom? Are you in there?

05:20.929 --> 05:23.064
- Mom, where you been?
Oh, my God.

05:23.164 --> 05:25.433
- Oh, there you are.
- How long was I in there?

05:25.534 --> 05:26.935
- I haven't seen you
for six hours.

05:27.035 --> 05:28.537
I thought you were kidnapped.
- Oh.

05:28.603 --> 05:30.071
You didn't call
the police, or anything or?

05:30.171 --> 05:31.740
- They do recommend you wait
24 hours.

05:31.840 --> 05:33.108
It's what they say
on all the shows.

05:33.208 --> 05:34.576
- I don't know if that's
the case, but--

05:34.676 --> 05:36.378
- I was worried though.
- Anyway, listen.

05:36.444 --> 05:38.880
I did some soul searching.
I think we got to let Larry go.

05:38.947 --> 05:41.116
- Let him go?
Are you on cocaine, Tom?

05:41.216 --> 05:43.018
- Cocaine? No. What do you do?
How do you--

05:43.084 --> 05:45.086
- We paid a lot
of money for him.

05:45.186 --> 05:46.755
Plus, he's a member
of the family.

05:46.855 --> 05:49.124
With your dad gone,
Larry's the man of the house.

05:49.224 --> 05:51.359
- Wait. Larry's the man
of the house? Not me?

05:51.426 --> 05:53.562
- No.
Larry's a lot older than you.

05:53.628 --> 05:55.730
- All right, fine. Larry stays.
- "All right, fine's"

05:55.797 --> 05:57.132
not gonna cut it.
Raise your right hand.

05:57.232 --> 05:58.967
We're gonna do
a promise pledge.

05:59.067 --> 06:01.303
- What do I say?

06:01.403 --> 06:02.604
- I swear to my mom--

06:02.704 --> 06:05.106
- That I will not set
Larry free.

06:05.206 --> 06:06.775
- I will not set Larry free.

06:06.875 --> 06:09.477
- I will keep him in this house
as the man of the house.

06:09.578 --> 06:13.248
And if I do not,
then my mother will die.

06:13.315 --> 06:15.450
I pledge on Larry's life. Amen.

06:15.550 --> 06:17.586
- I'm not gonna say that,
but you have my word.

06:19.087 --> 06:20.989
- Larry.
Oh, no. Oh.

06:21.089 --> 06:24.659
Slave. Sorry.
Prison. Cage. Prisoner.

06:24.759 --> 06:28.463
- Who gave you the moral
authority to enslave me?

06:30.632 --> 06:34.169
You get me out of this God
forsaken cage now!

06:34.269 --> 06:35.604
- Larry! Larry! Ahhh!

06:35.670 --> 06:37.005
All right,
so much for the pledge.

06:37.105 --> 06:38.907
That's just not gonna happen.

06:41.109 --> 06:42.410
- Tom, what's going on, man?

06:42.477 --> 06:43.945
I know you guys
got money problems

06:44.012 --> 06:46.081
but there's literally a rat
in your jacket.

06:46.147 --> 06:47.682
- That's not a rat.
It's my gerbil, Larry.

06:47.782 --> 06:49.017
I'm gonna set him free

06:49.117 --> 06:50.619
at the school today.
- Set him free?

06:50.685 --> 06:52.153
- I just want to let him
know the taste of freedom.

06:52.253 --> 06:53.588
I'm gonna let him go
on the soccer field.

06:53.655 --> 06:54.956
Turn him loose.
- The soccer field?

06:55.023 --> 06:56.458
Tom, do you see cleats
on this guy?

06:56.524 --> 06:57.792
- Cleats? On Larry? No.

06:57.859 --> 06:59.861
- Do you see colorful
Umbro shorts?

06:59.961 --> 07:01.262
- I don't.
- Exactly.

07:01.329 --> 07:03.131
You need to leave him
in the wilderness.

07:03.198 --> 07:04.332
He's a wild animal.

07:04.432 --> 07:05.934
- Nelson's right.
- Here we go.

07:06.001 --> 07:07.702
- Gerbils are direct
descendants of wolves, Tom.

07:07.802 --> 07:09.671
- They're not little wolves.
- Tom, there are two things

07:09.771 --> 07:11.339
buses and rodents.

07:11.439 --> 07:13.174
- Okay.
- This guy's an apex predator.

07:13.274 --> 07:16.611
He needs an ecosystem where he
can thrive and hunt and kill.

07:16.678 --> 07:17.946
- Oh. Okay.

07:18.013 --> 07:19.881
So where's the wilderness
in Central Jersey?

07:19.981 --> 07:21.783
- Behind the TJ Maxx
is perfect.

07:25.320 --> 07:27.122
Sorry, kids.
Emergency pit stop.

07:27.188 --> 07:29.057
Tom needs to hop out
and poop real quick.

07:29.157 --> 07:30.959
- No. Pee. I've gotta pee.
Why would you say that?

07:31.026 --> 07:32.627
- You need all the time
you can get.

07:32.694 --> 07:34.496
- He's right.
I got to take a quick dump.

07:34.562 --> 07:36.031
- Tom, you're gonna make
everybody late for school!

07:36.131 --> 07:37.565
- Just give me,
like, a half hour.

07:37.666 --> 07:39.668
- Why now? We're, like,
two minutes from school!

07:39.734 --> 07:40.902
- Hey, what can I say?

07:41.002 --> 07:42.737
I prefer the woods.
I can't hold it.

07:42.837 --> 07:44.839
I need some privacy
and some time.

07:46.341 --> 07:47.909
-
Okay, little angels.

07:48.009 --> 07:50.845
As you know,
this weekend is our big--

07:50.912 --> 07:52.313
- Hey, Tom?
- Hey.

07:52.380 --> 07:53.882
- Are you okay?
'Cause there've been a lot

07:53.982 --> 07:56.317
of high profile
pooping incidents recently.

07:56.384 --> 07:58.053
- Oh, I wasn't really--
That was a decoy.

07:58.153 --> 08:00.188
I did a good deed.
I set my gerbil free.

08:00.255 --> 08:01.756
- Hm?
- To live in the wilderness.

08:01.856 --> 08:03.858
- What?
- In the woods behind TJ Maxx.

08:03.925 --> 08:05.760
- Tom, gerbils
are domesticated pets.

08:05.860 --> 08:07.095
Without food or water,
he'll die!

08:07.195 --> 08:08.596
- What do you mean?
He's like a wolf.

08:08.697 --> 08:09.698
He's like an apex predator,
I was told.

08:09.764 --> 08:10.999
- What's their prey?

08:11.066 --> 08:12.434
Little pellets
that come in a bag?

08:12.534 --> 08:14.235
- Excuse me, you two.
Is there something

08:14.335 --> 08:16.604
more important
going on than syncopation?

08:16.705 --> 08:18.606
- Tom's gerbil's in the woods
behind TJ Maxx

08:18.707 --> 08:20.942
and if we don't find him now,
he's gonna die!

08:21.042 --> 08:23.111
- Your gerbil is on the loose?
- I'm on it.

08:23.211 --> 08:24.846
I'll blast out
a community alert.

08:24.913 --> 08:26.681
Tom, what's the reward?
- Oh, just put down a dollar.

08:26.748 --> 08:29.084
My mom has money problems.
- No, no. That's not enough.

08:29.184 --> 08:31.052
Um, I'm gonna put in 10,000!

08:31.119 --> 08:32.954
- 10,000? No, no, no!
- Done. Let's go.

08:33.054 --> 08:34.522
- Done?
- A 10 G gerbil!

08:34.589 --> 08:36.224
- No, we--we never established
the 10 G's.

08:36.291 --> 08:38.893
- Are you kidding me?
Let's go find that gerbil!

08:39.561 --> 08:44.365
- Loser, swipe.
Fake hair, swipe.

08:44.432 --> 08:47.535
Fingered me
in a parking lot, swipe.

08:47.602 --> 08:50.972
"$10,000 reward
for missing elderly gerbil

08:51.072 --> 08:55.910
in woods behind TJ Maxx."
Son of a bitch.

09:07.422 --> 09:09.390
- Okay, everyone.
Welcome to the manhunt.

09:09.457 --> 09:11.259
I really appreciate
you coming out.

09:11.326 --> 09:13.628
As a very wise plumber
once told me,

09:13.728 --> 09:14.996
"Every life is precious."

09:17.398 --> 09:19.567
- Hi, everyone. Attention! Hi.
Hello.

09:19.634 --> 09:22.070
I'm Tom's mom.
I'm in control here.

09:22.137 --> 09:24.405
And to clarify,
there's no reward.

09:24.472 --> 09:25.673
That was a joke.

09:25.774 --> 09:27.776
- A joke? What happened
to the ten grand?

09:27.842 --> 09:29.177
- I'm gonna get fired

09:29.277 --> 09:31.179
'cause I helped you search
for this gerbil!

09:31.279 --> 09:33.014
- I'm gonna leave.
- Okay, fine.

09:33.114 --> 09:35.683
For argument's sake,
let's say there's a reward.

09:35.784 --> 09:38.620
You'll get $10,000.
Of my own money.

09:38.686 --> 09:40.288
Now, I'm gonna have Tom,

09:40.355 --> 09:42.457
my son here,
explain who we're looking for.

09:42.524 --> 09:45.760
- Thanks, Ma.
Well, he's of average weight.

09:45.827 --> 09:48.296
And average height.
Average gerbil height.

09:48.363 --> 09:51.699
Standard gerbil color.
In the beige family.

09:51.800 --> 09:54.369
- Yeah, that doesn't help.
- All right, he's elderly.

09:54.469 --> 09:56.805
So when you search,
it's important that you yell,

09:56.871 --> 09:58.773
"Here, sweet baby Larry!"

09:58.840 --> 10:01.810
- So we're just looking
for a nondescript animal

10:01.876 --> 10:04.979
in a large wooded area
while we're screaming,

10:05.046 --> 10:07.549
"Here, sweet baby Larry."
- Oh, last thing.

10:07.649 --> 10:09.651
You need to cut up
some sliced pears and say,

10:09.717 --> 10:11.019
"Who's ready for din din?"

10:11.119 --> 10:12.854
I know it's a lot.

10:12.954 --> 10:14.222
- Now, please,

10:14.322 --> 10:17.492
can we get serious
and go find that gerbil?

10:19.294 --> 10:21.696
- Tom, we need to find
Larry ourselves

10:21.796 --> 10:23.531
or it's coming out
of your college fund.

10:23.631 --> 10:25.567

at pep talks.
