WEBVTT

00:03.203 --> 00:05.133
[Mac]
Yo! Hey! Bro, help us out here!

00:05.471 --> 00:07.582
- [Charlie] Swim time! It's a heat wave, dude!
- Heat wave!

00:07.941 --> 00:09.871
- Heat wave! Heat wave!
- I'm sorry about that. Can I help you?

00:10.210 --> 00:11.990
- Yeah, two checking in for the pool.
- Check us in.

00:12.312 --> 00:14.772
Sorry, sir.
You can't bring beer onto the premises.

00:15.181 --> 00:17.401
- What? You can't drink in this pool?
- [Scoffs]

00:17.784 --> 00:19.974
- That's kind of weird.
- Charlie, chug this.

00:20.353 --> 00:22.283
- Yeah, we'll pound 'em.
- We'll just have to finish these out here.

00:22.622 --> 00:25.052
- Here. Help us out. The boss isn't around.
- No. I'm-I'm good.

00:25.458 --> 00:26.748
- All right. More for us.
- You sure?

00:26.993 --> 00:30.213
I'm sure. Yeah. I'm gonna assume
you guys aren't members here.

00:30.730 --> 00:31.990
Just go ahead and sign us up.

00:32.232 --> 00:33.632
- We'll blaze through these in no time.
- Yeah.

00:33.900 --> 00:35.600
Actually, if you'd like
to join our swim club...

00:35.902 --> 00:37.952
you need to be sponsored
by two existing members.

00:38.304 --> 00:39.734
But I'm sorry to tell you, fellas...

00:40.006 --> 00:42.176
that membership is currently at capacity.

00:44.611 --> 00:46.221
- At capacity?
- Yeah.

00:46.513 --> 00:48.293
- [Belches]
- We're in the middle of a terrible heat wave...

00:48.615 --> 00:50.545
and you happen to be at capacity... for us.

00:50.884 --> 00:52.434
Well, you can try the public pool, but...

00:52.719 --> 00:55.619
[Belches] Oh, thank you.
Thank you for your suggestion.

00:56.089 --> 00:57.929
- We're out of here. Let's go.
- Yeah.

00:58.258 --> 01:00.838
- [Bleeps] you.
- You don't have to... Oh. Sir.

01:01.261 --> 01:03.191
I cannot believe that that just happened,
in this day and age.

01:03.530 --> 01:05.260
I know.
I can't believe there's such a big list.

01:05.565 --> 01:07.615
Mm-mmm. Don't you get it, dude?

01:07.967 --> 01:10.957
They'll always be "at capacity" for us.

01:11.438 --> 01:13.398
I don't get that at all.
Is that what he said?

01:13.740 --> 01:16.550
Don't you get it? We got big-timed, dude.
He called us lower class.

01:17.010 --> 01:18.760
- He called us lower class?
- Yeah.

01:19.079 --> 01:21.069
Yeah, but I wouldn't argue with that, dude.
We're definitely lower class.

01:21.414 --> 01:22.874
Yeah, I'm not disputing that fact, dude.

01:23.149 --> 01:25.259
I'm saying we shouldn't get boxed out for it.
It's bullshit.

01:25.618 --> 01:27.258
Honestly, I just wanna go swimming.
[Belches]

01:27.554 --> 01:29.254
Should we suck it up and
go to the public pool?

01:29.556 --> 01:33.066
Ugh! Gross, dude. I will not go
to that disgusting public pool.

01:33.626 --> 01:34.996
People there are gross.

01:35.261 --> 01:37.401
- I got a good idea. Let's get out of here.
- [Belches]

01:40.567 --> 01:42.117
There she is.

01:42.402 --> 01:44.102
This is what I'm talking about, bro.

01:44.404 --> 01:46.134
Man, the old diving pool.

01:46.439 --> 01:48.249
Remember how much fun
we used to have here?

01:48.575 --> 01:51.125
- It's all deep end.
- Hell, yeah, we had fun, dude.

01:51.544 --> 01:54.004
You know why?
Because this was a pool for people like us.

01:54.414 --> 01:57.194
Street guys. And I think it's clear
why it looks like shit now.

01:57.650 --> 01:59.430
'Cause Jamie Nelson drowned in it.
[Snickers]

01:59.752 --> 02:01.152
What?

02:01.421 --> 02:04.381
No. No, I was gonna say it was
because of a pattern of discrimination...

02:04.858 --> 02:06.638
because this was a pool
for lower-class people.

02:06.960 --> 02:08.360
- Dude, what?
- Yeah.

02:08.627 --> 02:11.408
Look, dude, I say it's time we take matters
into our own hands with this.

02:11.865 --> 02:14.965
- What you thinking?
- I'm saying we fix up this pool.

02:17.737 --> 02:19.577
- [Both Slurping Beer]
- Ahh!

02:21.000 --> 02:27.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:55.408 --> 02:58.248
Man, I'm gonna have to keep tinkering with the A.
C. 'cause I can't feel it at all.

02:58.711 --> 02:59.911
Can you feel it?

03:00.146 --> 03:02.836
Charlie, you gotta focus, okay?
A pool is a major investment.

03:03.283 --> 03:05.013
So if we're gonna get Frank
on board with this...

03:05.318 --> 03:07.018
we have to approach him as equals.

03:07.320 --> 03:10.160
- Okay. Is that why you got that gold chain?
- That's why I got the gold chain.

03:10.623 --> 03:12.203
Okay.
I see what you're going after here.

03:12.492 --> 03:14.072
- Hey, Frank!
- Yeah.

03:14.360 --> 03:17.260
We have a little bit of a presentation for you.
Can you come down?

03:17.730 --> 03:19.220
[Groans]

03:19.499 --> 03:22.109
Oh, what's up? What's with the sheet?

03:22.535 --> 03:24.755
Not just yet, okay? Please, have a seat.

03:26.306 --> 03:27.796
Charlie, get Frank a beer.

03:28.074 --> 03:31.444
- [Imitating Airplane Engine]
- Don't do airplane noises. Just give him the beer.

03:31.978 --> 03:33.708
- Good move.
- Why don't we get beers?

03:34.013 --> 03:35.473
Because you're not even
supposed to be here.

03:35.748 --> 03:38.268
- Frank is the audience. Just keep your mouth shut.
- Sheet, sheet, sheet.

03:38.685 --> 03:40.355
Okay, ready. Hey, ho, here we go!

03:40.653 --> 03:43.693
Boom! Pool!

03:44.190 --> 03:46.820
Charlie and I found this abandoned pool
that we used to swim in when we were kids.

03:47.260 --> 03:49.010
- It's full of branches and shit.
- It's a big mess.

03:49.329 --> 03:51.079
If we have a little bit of money,
we can clean it up...

03:51.397 --> 03:53.127
- Pass.
- Just let me finish.

03:53.433 --> 03:56.653
- I have a whole thing...
- Pass. It's too much work. What else you got?

03:57.170 --> 03:59.890
Is this 'cause you guys are still all pissed
off about not getting into that swim club?

04:00.340 --> 04:02.240
If you guys were there,
you would know how we feel.

04:02.575 --> 04:04.975
No, no, no. Stop yourself right there.
We would not know how it feels...

04:05.378 --> 04:07.218
'cause Dee and I would have waltzed
right into that swim club.

04:07.547 --> 04:10.707
Yeah, you don't lump Dennis and me
in with you. We're high class, so...

04:11.217 --> 04:13.437
You should've seen this guy.
He would have lumped the shit out of you.

04:13.820 --> 04:15.930
- We live in the same apartment.
- Let me explain to you guys...

04:16.289 --> 04:17.599
a little something about how class works.

04:17.857 --> 04:19.997
You're born into class.
It's about pedigree. It's about upbringing.

04:20.360 --> 04:22.110
It has nothing to do
with your present circumstances.

04:22.428 --> 04:24.128
Dennis and I were born upper class...

04:24.430 --> 04:26.980
and therefore we currently are
and will forever remain upper class.

04:27.400 --> 04:30.300
Frank, stop picking your teeth
for one second and back us up on this.

04:30.770 --> 04:33.080
I quit on that shit. You understand?

04:33.473 --> 04:35.903
I quit on it.
I don't give a rat's ass about class.

04:36.309 --> 04:38.679
I live on the fringe.
Fringe class is where I am.

04:39.078 --> 04:42.118
You're in the fringe class. I still maintain
that Dee and I are in the upper class.

04:42.615 --> 04:44.695
All this talk has really got me thinking
about taking a dip.

04:45.051 --> 04:46.361
- I'm hot as shit, Dee.
- Oh, yeah.

04:46.619 --> 04:47.879
- We could go pop a hydrant.
- [Scoffs]

04:48.121 --> 04:49.991
- We'd beat the heat that way.
- I'm not popping shit.

04:50.323 --> 04:51.933
That's about as low class as it gets. Dee?

04:52.225 --> 04:53.095
- Swim club.
- Swim club.

04:53.293 --> 04:54.583
- Later, bitches.
- Okay.

04:59.399 --> 05:01.979
Sorry, sir. We are at capacity.

05:02.402 --> 05:04.332
Capacity? That is unbelievable...

05:04.671 --> 05:06.451
that you would use
the word "capacity" with us.

05:06.773 --> 05:10.373
We truly could not admit you, even if
you had the sponsors, which you don't.

05:10.943 --> 05:12.553
Well, we know you. You could sponsor us.

05:12.845 --> 05:15.885
I don't know what kind of idea you have
about us, but we, sir, are like you.

05:16.382 --> 05:19.422
Uh, send a little something sweet
his way maybe.

05:19.919 --> 05:21.939
- Oh. A little sweetness, huh?
- Want a little something sweet?

05:22.288 --> 05:24.598
- If that's the only language he understands.
- In the mood for sweets?

05:24.991 --> 05:27.131
Sir, please, you're just
embarrassing yourself now.

05:27.493 --> 05:29.633
Oh, I'm embarrassing?

05:29.996 --> 05:31.956
- I'm embarrassing myself?
- [Laughs]

05:32.298 --> 05:34.168
Said the elitist pool guy.

05:34.500 --> 05:37.780
Dee, I don't even think I'd want to be
a part of some exclusionary pool club...

05:38.304 --> 05:40.734
propagated by this-this man,
this-this hatemonger.

05:41.140 --> 05:44.160
Oh, yeah, I'm with you. I bet you
don't even have any black people here.

05:44.644 --> 05:47.954
Excuse me, ma'am, but there
is an African-American family right there.

05:48.481 --> 05:50.791
Well, good for you. You keep a couple
of token ones around, do you?

05:51.184 --> 05:52.884
- Parade 'em around like dancing monkeys?
- Right. Oh, no...

05:53.186 --> 05:54.886
- I didn't mean it like that.
- Monkeys?

05:55.188 --> 05:57.178
- It's a phrase that means performing on command.
- It's a phrase.

05:57.523 --> 05:58.513
- It-It-It...
- Listen.

05:58.725 --> 06:00.975
You are more than happy
to try the public pool.

06:01.361 --> 06:03.091
Oh, can we? Well, maybe we will.

06:03.396 --> 06:05.126
Yeah, because we have class.

06:05.431 --> 06:07.981
And having class means being able
to mix with people that are beneath you.

06:08.401 --> 06:09.571
- Mm-hmm.
- Come on.

06:09.802 --> 06:11.582
Your shirt doesn't even fit, by the way.

06:11.904 --> 06:13.364
If you wanna be an elitist,
get yourself a tailor.

06:13.639 --> 06:14.509
- [Blows]
- Oh.

06:14.707 --> 06:16.927
- Oh! Oh!
- No, Dee, that's...

06:17.310 --> 06:19.830
- severely lacking in class.
- Yeah. Too much? My bad. Got carried away.

06:24.884 --> 06:27.314
[Dennis] Oh, Jesus Christ.
This is like a goddamn zoo.

06:27.720 --> 06:30.330
[Dee] Uh, there's a very
disturbing lack of adults here.

06:30.757 --> 06:33.187
That girl just jumped in
with her sneakers on.

06:33.593 --> 06:35.293
These people all have sneakers on.

06:35.595 --> 06:37.435
[Dennis]
You know what's happening here?

06:37.764 --> 06:39.874
We're just experiencing
a little bit of culture shock.

06:40.233 --> 06:43.363
These people are very different from the people
that are at our normal pool environment...

06:43.870 --> 06:45.210
and this whole environment
is very different.

06:45.471 --> 06:47.491
And that's okay.
That's okay. It's not a bad thing.

06:47.840 --> 06:49.800
- [Frank] Dennis. Deandra.
- What are you doing here?

06:50.143 --> 06:53.213
I tried to pop a hydrant, but there
was no lookout, so I got shut down.

06:53.713 --> 06:55.413
I see that you have a towel.
Where did you get that?

06:55.715 --> 06:57.415
I don't see any attendants around here.

06:57.717 --> 07:00.497
Oh, I bartered fringe style
with that guy over there.

07:00.953 --> 07:03.913
I gave him a bite of my hot dog,
he's letting me use his towel.

07:05.391 --> 07:07.351
- Want a bite?
- No.

07:12.498 --> 07:14.338
- Yo, Mac!
- Yeah.

07:14.667 --> 07:17.737
Hey, dude. I think this right here
has got "keeper pile" written all over it.

07:18.237 --> 07:20.287
We could probably set
some of this up strategically...

07:20.640 --> 07:22.810
to represent where all the cool shit
in the pool's gonna be.

07:23.176 --> 07:24.876
Like this rusty bike frame?

07:25.178 --> 07:27.348
We could be, like,
"That's where the swim-up bar is."

07:27.713 --> 07:29.583
- Swim-up bar. That's good, dude.
- Yeah.

07:29.916 --> 07:31.286
Man, I got a whole plan.

07:31.551 --> 07:34.301
We'll dip one of those cans
with the string on it into the water...

07:34.754 --> 07:36.974
and when we're underwater,
we'll place our order.

07:37.356 --> 07:41.366
"Two beers, please." And when we swim
up to the top, Dennis hands them to us.

07:41.994 --> 07:45.564
Well, I was thinking
we'd be at capacity for Dennis...

07:46.132 --> 07:49.172
but I guess if he's serving us, then that
makes him lower than us, so that's cool.

07:49.669 --> 07:51.129
He'll be lower than us.
Don't worry about that.

07:51.404 --> 07:54.014
I don't wanna put a tin can in the water
with a string 'cause we're not eight.

07:54.440 --> 07:56.930
I just thought it'd be cool.
Put it in your ear. Put it in your mouth.

07:57.343 --> 07:59.093
[Mac]
Yeah, that's not cool, but...

07:59.412 --> 08:01.162
- Well, it's classy.
- Neither.

08:01.481 --> 08:04.031
All right. Well, you wanna pop down here
and help me chuck this mattress out?

08:04.450 --> 08:06.260
- Yeah.
- It's the last big thing I got.

08:06.586 --> 08:08.076
Yeah, we'll get all of this out of here.

08:08.354 --> 08:10.134
Ooh! God, dude, it's really squishy.

08:10.456 --> 08:13.556
Yeah, it's covered in chlorine water,
but it's clean.

08:14.060 --> 08:16.230
There hasn't been chlorine in here
since Jamie Nelson.

08:16.596 --> 08:19.056
But it's probably like raw sewage
that's been sitting here.

08:19.465 --> 08:21.575
[Sniffs]
Yeah, it's got a sewagey smell.

08:21.934 --> 08:23.634
- Yeah. All right.
- Let's just chuck it out. Ready?

08:23.936 --> 08:26.126
- Yeah, let's get it out of here.
- Give it a boost.

08:26.506 --> 08:28.236
- You ready?
- [Both] One, two, three.

08:28.541 --> 08:30.591
[Cheering]

08:30.943 --> 08:32.253
- [Grunting]
- Whoo!

08:32.511 --> 08:34.682
- I'm strong, dude.
- I'm definitely getting stronger.

08:35.047 --> 08:37.417
- Whoo!
- Wow, dude. This pool is sweet, man. It's super deep.

08:37.817 --> 08:39.486
Yeah, I know. I know.

08:39.784 --> 08:44.065
Yeah. Hey, dude, um, how have you
been getting in and out of here?

08:44.724 --> 08:47.304
I was climbing up the mattress...
sort of like a ladder-type situation.

08:47.727 --> 08:49.097
[Sighs]

08:49.362 --> 08:50.672
Aw, shit.

08:51.797 --> 08:53.227
Well...

08:53.499 --> 08:55.399
Are we stuck in here?

08:55.735 --> 08:57.435
I think we're stuck.

08:57.737 --> 08:59.467
Help!

08:59.772 --> 09:01.352
- Help!
- Help!

09:05.511 --> 09:06.771
- Come on!
- Come on, man.

09:07.013 --> 09:08.823
I can't even make out an angle
to do a lap or anything.

09:09.148 --> 09:10.788
- Ow! Son of a bitch!
- Wha-Wha-What?

09:11.083 --> 09:13.073
I just stepped on broken glass. Ow!

09:13.419 --> 09:16.439
Oh, my God. There are shards of broken
glass all over the bottom of the pool.

09:16.923 --> 09:18.473
Well, now I know
why people are wearing shoes.

09:18.758 --> 09:21.568
- Yeah. Now the shoes make a lot of sense.
- Okay. Frank.

09:22.028 --> 09:24.078
What in the hell are you doing
with that watermelon, man?

09:24.430 --> 09:25.690
- You ever play this game?
- [Dennis] No.

09:25.932 --> 09:28.152
You grease the watermelon up,
you throw it in the pool.

09:28.534 --> 09:30.934
Everybody goes crazy trying to grab it.
They can't grab it.

09:31.337 --> 09:33.177
Greased watermelon!

09:33.506 --> 09:35.496
- Here it comes! Try to grab it!
- Oh, no!

09:35.841 --> 09:37.101
Come on.

09:38.911 --> 09:40.551
[Dennis]
Come on.

09:42.982 --> 09:45.062
Ugh. I can't believe you borrowed
hot dog guy's towel.

09:45.418 --> 09:47.168
- Yeah, well, I'm not proud of it.
- Gross.

09:47.486 --> 09:49.186
- I have a proposition.
- I have a proposition too.

09:49.488 --> 09:51.798
Let me walk in front of you so you
don't get your blood all over my feet.

09:52.191 --> 09:54.471
That's fair.
Why don't we call Mac and Charlie?

09:54.860 --> 09:56.530
I just feel like their pool
has gotta be better than this.

09:56.829 --> 09:59.169
No. We don't want them to know
we didn't get into the private swim club.

09:59.565 --> 10:01.295
- Oh, son of a bitch!
- What?

10:01.601 --> 10:05.081
Which one of you little shits
stole my shoes? Goddamn it!

10:05.638 --> 10:07.388
- I'm putting out a feeler call.

10:10.276 --> 10:11.586
Ah! Ah!

10:11.844 --> 10:13.594
Okay. I think I see
what the problem is though.

10:13.913 --> 10:15.663
This move is intended for a back flip...

10:15.982 --> 10:17.382
and what I need to do is a front flip.

10:17.650 --> 10:19.640
If you needed a back flip,
I'd be up that wall in a second, bro.

10:19.986 --> 10:21.476
- No, you just wouldn't...
- Yeah.

10:21.754 --> 10:24.184
You just would not because you don't know
how to do a back flip.

10:24.590 --> 10:27.220
- Charlie, I do back flips every single day of my life.
- No, you don't.

10:27.660 --> 10:31.350
I have never seen you... Do a back flip
right now. Can I see one? Let's see one.

10:31.931 --> 10:36.001
Well, I need to stay focused and conserve
energy, and that's, you know... Come on.

10:36.636 --> 10:38.686
[Mocking Mac, Gibberish]

10:39.038 --> 10:40.878
What if I need to do a back flip later?

10:41.207 --> 10:43.377
You're not gonna need to!
You need to do some kind of flip now!

10:43.743 --> 10:45.883
And you don't know how 'cause you
don't know how to flip or do karate!

10:46.245 --> 10:48.025
All you know how to do
is talk me into doing shit...

10:48.347 --> 10:50.657
- where I get stuck in a pool where I'm definitely gonna die!
- [Cell Phone Rings]

10:51.050 --> 10:53.070
Oh, wait. My phone's ringing.
Hang on. My phone's ringing.

10:53.419 --> 10:55.439
You've had a cell phone this entire time, dude?
Are you kidding me?

10:55.788 --> 10:57.188
Shh. Yello!

10:57.456 --> 10:59.476
Hey, Charlie. Hey.
Dennis and I were just...

10:59.825 --> 11:01.555
No, no. Leave my name out of it.

11:01.861 --> 11:03.531
It's Dee and Dennis, dude.
They'll rescue us.

11:03.829 --> 11:05.849
- No, dude. Do not tell them that we're stuck in here.
- Why?

11:06.198 --> 11:08.658
Because getting stuck in an abandoned pool
is extremely low class.

11:09.068 --> 11:10.378
Dennis will sink his teeth into it.

11:10.636 --> 11:12.916
I feel like if I talk to him,
it's gonna slip out.

11:13.305 --> 11:15.295
- Just don't let it slip out.
- But I kind of wanna tell him.

11:15.641 --> 11:17.341
- Just give me the phone.
- We're stuck in a pool!

11:17.643 --> 11:18.783
- Shh, shh.
- [Whimpers]

11:19.011 --> 11:20.351
It's Mac.

11:20.613 --> 11:24.013
How's it going over there in your,
uh, deserted mine shaft or whatever?

11:24.550 --> 11:26.220
<i>It's pretty sweet here. Okay?</i>

11:26.519 --> 11:29.559
It's very private. Probably way more
private than your piece-of-shit pool.

- Really? Well, I doubt that, you know.
<i>- ♪♪ [Latin]</i>

11:33.125 --> 11:34.235
Is that Mexican music?

11:34.460 --> 11:36.010

- Oh, the music.

11:36.295 --> 11:38.195
Uh, you know,
that's... it's... You know what it is.

11:38.531 --> 11:41.571
It's one of the attendants.
He's walking around with... a ghetto blaster...

11:42.068 --> 11:45.818
serving us drinks and just
making us comfortable, giving us hats.

11:46.405 --> 11:49.215
Uh... Uh...
Why does it sound so echoey over there?

11:49.675 --> 11:51.455
Nothing but relaxation going on over here.

11:51.777 --> 11:53.477
- It's very relaxey.
- We're stuck in the pool!

11:53.779 --> 11:56.119
And, uh, that's probably
what you're hearing is the relaxation.

11:56.515 --> 11:58.855
Hey! Hey! Those are my shoes!

11:59.251 --> 12:00.481
<i>What?</i>

12:00.720 --> 12:02.970
Uh, the attendant, you know,
he just walked off with my shoes...

12:03.355 --> 12:05.025
and... [Growls]
it made me mad because he didn't ask.

12:05.324 --> 12:06.664
- But...
- But...

12:06.926 --> 12:11.176
But it's great because in the end
I'm gonna end up with polished shoes.

12:11.831 --> 12:14.111

You know how it goes. Okay, bye.

12:14.500 --> 12:15.760
[Beeps]

12:16.001 --> 12:18.871
Damn it, dude. That private pool's awesome.
They have attendants.

12:19.338 --> 12:21.298
Oh, my God.
Who's in attendance? How many people?

12:21.640 --> 12:23.810
She didn't say anything...
No, people that wait on them hand and foot.

12:24.176 --> 12:26.226
- Oh, my God. Really?
- Yes. Oh, my God.

- Dude, since when do you have a cell phone?

12:29.548 --> 12:31.038
I buy 'em all the time.

12:31.317 --> 12:33.277
You prepay for it,
and then you buy it and you throw it away.

12:33.619 --> 12:35.319
- There's a name for it.
- A burner?

12:35.621 --> 12:37.961
- A burner! That's a burner.
- This is what drug dealers buy.

12:38.357 --> 12:41.547
- Oh, really?
- This is a very specific sect of lower class, okay?

12:42.061 --> 12:43.961
This is like... This is like felon class.

12:44.296 --> 12:46.636
- Felon class, huh?
- God! All right, okay, so let me see.

12:47.032 --> 12:49.022
Who are we gonna call?
We can't call the police because...

12:49.368 --> 12:50.658
- We're trespassing.
- Yeah.

12:50.903 --> 12:53.333
I got an idea. Let's order some food.

12:53.739 --> 12:55.029
- Oh! Yeah.
- Yeah.

12:55.274 --> 12:57.204
And then we'll have the delivery guy come,
and he can help us out.

12:57.543 --> 12:58.803
Perfect. And we can get
some Chinese food...

12:59.044 --> 13:01.624
'cause that's the classiest poolside food
you can have.

13:02.047 --> 13:04.187
Yeah, we probably shouldn't
get Chinese though...

13:04.550 --> 13:06.250
because those delivery guys
are always Chinese...

13:06.552 --> 13:08.192
and he won't understand
a word we're saying...

13:08.487 --> 13:10.237
- and plus, he's probably gonna be too short.
- Ooh.

13:10.556 --> 13:12.636
- Yeah.
- I could really go for some Chinese food though, man.

13:12.992 --> 13:15.072
- That'd be good.
- But we're not actually eating the food.

13:15.427 --> 13:17.827
- So...
- I'm gonna eat the food, for sure. I'm starving.

13:18.230 --> 13:21.330
You know what, dude? Let me handle it.
I'm gonna call pizza delivery.

13:21.834 --> 13:23.174
Pizza. We're gonna get some pizza.

It'll be some big Italian lug,
and he'll fish us out of here.

13:27.006 --> 13:29.556
- Fish sounds good. See if they have fish there.
- I'll ask.

This place is a shit-hole.

- What was that?

- What?
- That's a rock, Dennis.

13:53.499 --> 13:55.519

at each other for fun.

Yeah, well, we better
before I lose it and I drown a child.

Here you go.

We ate the watermelon.

and jump in the pool.

14:33.172 --> 14:34.692
You gotta be kidding me. He's Chinese.

14:34.974 --> 14:37.194
I know, but his English sounds pretty good,
and he's big too, right?

14:37.576 --> 14:39.686
Hey, we're stuck in this pool, dude.
Can you help us out?

14:40.045 --> 14:41.305

Look, dude, we'll pay you first,
and then help us out of here.

14:44.950 --> 14:47.530

- Uh, no. Shit.

14:47.953 --> 14:49.383
Check your front pockets.
What are you doing?

14:49.655 --> 14:51.965
I cut them off 'cause they were
overshooting the bottom of my shorts.

14:52.358 --> 14:54.108
- Forget it. I'm out of here.
- [Both] No, no, wait!

14:54.426 --> 14:56.356
- We'll give you a gold chain.
- Ooh, ooh, yeah, yeah.

14:56.695 --> 14:58.065
- Toss it up.
- Okay.

14:58.330 --> 15:00.990
- There you go.
- Toss that pizza down too. I'm starving.

15:01.433 --> 15:03.653

- We might as well. I haven't eaten.

- No! Dude!
- Sorry.

then you can pull us up.

15:10.409 --> 15:12.929
- See that hose right there?
- That'd be good. Just pull us up.

15:13.345 --> 15:15.125

15:16.682 --> 15:18.112
All right. Here we go.

15:18.384 --> 15:19.814
Ah, that's perfect. That's perfect.

15:20.085 --> 15:21.815

15:22.121 --> 15:24.171
I'm sorry, dude. He's white trash.

- I'm out of here.

15:27.526 --> 15:29.166
- Pull us up!
- Don't go!

15:29.461 --> 15:31.361
All right, whatever.
No problem. No problem.

15:31.697 --> 15:33.427
- You can just climb it.
- I'm just gonna climb right up.

15:33.732 --> 15:36.342
- All right. Climb up.
- Stand back, 'cause it takes a real man to do this.

15:36.769 --> 15:38.319
You ready, bro?

15:38.604 --> 15:39.914
- [Grunts]
- Oh! Whoa!

15:40.172 --> 15:41.512
Aw, man!

15:42.508 --> 15:44.618
Oh, dude.

15:44.977 --> 15:47.817
- All right, that's it. I'm calling Dennis.
- No.

15:48.280 --> 15:50.500
Don't you understand?
This pool is our bootstraps...

15:50.883 --> 15:53.073
and it's lifting us up
into the middle class, dude.

15:53.452 --> 15:55.292
Well, just accept the fact
that you're white trash, all right?

15:55.621 --> 15:57.401
Take a look at yourself.
You can't do back flips.

15:57.723 --> 15:59.473
You don't know karate. You're white trash!

15:59.792 --> 16:01.812
You're white trash too, dude.
Those shorts are white trash.

16:02.161 --> 16:03.971
Do not call the shorts white trash.

16:04.296 --> 16:06.076
Dennis told me about these shorts.
They're not white trash.

16:06.398 --> 16:09.238
Look at this.
Look at this. Look what I can do.

16:12.404 --> 16:15.804
What is white trash about that?
Don't call me white trash.

16:16.342 --> 16:18.092
I feel like if I had
that kind of mobility...

16:18.410 --> 16:20.490
I'd be capable of almost,
well, pretty much anything.

16:20.846 --> 16:22.546
Well, yeah,
maybe then you could get the flip.

16:22.848 --> 16:24.838
- Although I really doubt it.
- I could probably get that flip.

16:25.184 --> 16:26.554
- Can we just call Dennis?
- Fine. Call Dennis.

16:26.819 --> 16:29.219
Yeah... Oh, shit, dude.

16:30.556 --> 16:32.456
I put the phone in my front pocket.

16:36.428 --> 16:38.648
Goddamn it.

16:40.766 --> 16:42.466
How is this gonna work? We look bad.

16:42.768 --> 16:44.468
We're getting in this pool
if it's the last thing we do.

16:44.770 --> 16:46.470
We just need two sponsors, and
we'll get in. Don't worry.

16:46.772 --> 16:48.472
You don't think we should go home
and take a shower first?

16:48.774 --> 16:51.174
- We don't have time to take a shower. Here we go.
- Oh.

16:51.577 --> 16:52.567
Hey, hey!

16:52.778 --> 16:54.388
- Hi, family, little ones.
- Hey!

16:54.680 --> 16:55.530
[Dennis]
Hi, Mom.

16:55.714 --> 16:57.414
Sorry to jump out in front of you.

16:57.716 --> 16:59.886
But there is a bit of a heat wave going on
in Philly right now.

17:00.252 --> 17:02.712
- It's a terrific heat wave, and it's affecting everybody.
- It really is.

17:03.122 --> 17:04.821
And we were looking
to cool down a little bit.

17:05.124 --> 17:06.824
This pool,
that'd be a great place for us to cool off.

17:07.126 --> 17:09.556
Oh, yeah. And you know what?
We just need a couple of sponsors.

17:09.962 --> 17:11.892
Yeah, a couple of sponsors.
Hey, Dee, you're bleeding a little bit.

17:12.231 --> 17:13.461
Is it bleeding? Is it happening?

17:13.699 --> 17:14.929
Kids, don't touch the blood.

17:15.166 --> 17:17.307
Hey, guys,
I got kicked out of that other pool.

17:17.669 --> 17:19.628
This Filipino lady went crazy on me.

17:19.972 --> 17:22.252
She started scratching me
like a velociraptor.

17:22.641 --> 17:24.310
It stings like... Ah!

17:24.609 --> 17:26.480
Excuse me. What is happening here?

17:26.811 --> 17:28.712
These people are bleeding
all over the place.

17:29.048 --> 17:30.778
- We're not bleeding all over the place.
- All over the place?

17:31.083 --> 17:33.253
Mrs. Baines,
I am sorry if they were harassing you.

17:33.619 --> 17:36.139
- Please have a wonderful day. We'll see you very soon.
- [Frank] Hey, kids.

17:36.555 --> 17:38.695
Listen, buddy, you gotta let
us in the pool. It's so hot.

17:39.058 --> 17:41.078
Try to understand.

17:41.427 --> 17:43.207
We are at capacity.

17:43.529 --> 17:45.369
We're not at capacity,
'cause I can see the pool from here.

18:06.285 --> 18:07.595
All right.

18:07.853 --> 18:09.723
You see, Charlie, this
is a proper memorial.

18:10.055 --> 18:11.925
I think Jamie Nelson would have liked this.

18:12.257 --> 18:15.297
Yeah. I like the skateboard,
'cause Jamie loved skateboarding.

18:15.794 --> 18:17.694
- He did like skateboarding.
- Not much of a swimmer.

18:18.030 --> 18:19.670
- Not a very good swimmer. No, he wasn't.
- No.

18:19.965 --> 18:21.275
Okay, well, I think we can both agree...

18:21.533 --> 18:23.583
that we need to make sure
that his spirit does not haunt us.

18:23.936 --> 18:25.636
Yes. We definitely wanna
ward off his spirit.

18:25.938 --> 18:28.188
- So if you know any voodoo or whatever, go ahead and...
- Should we join hands?

18:28.574 --> 18:31.564
Well, it's not called voodoo, okay?
This is the Lord our Savior.

18:32.044 --> 18:33.594

- Okay, here we go.

18:35.881 --> 18:37.661
What is that? There's a lamb?

Lamb of God who taketh away

You don't have to provide any kind of...
Let me just do my thing.

we get that spirit out of here.

If you're not gonna take this seriously...

19:10.616 --> 19:11.576
I'm taking it perfectly seriously.

- [Frank] Where the hell is...
- Oh! Nice.

19:14.119 --> 19:16.169
This place is a shit-hole, huh?

19:16.522 --> 19:18.512
I don't know
why I thought it would look any different.

19:18.857 --> 19:20.637

- [Dennis] Hey, guys.

19:20.959 --> 19:23.589
- Hey!
- [Frank] What the hell are you doing down there?

19:24.029 --> 19:25.729
- Nothing. We're just hanging out.
- We got stuck in this...

Shut up. Shut up.
We're good. We're good. We're good.

19:29.134 --> 19:31.154
We're good. We're just chillin'.

19:31.503 --> 19:34.253
This is pathetic. The word "trashy"
just doesn't even do it justice.

19:34.706 --> 19:36.286
Whatever.
What are you guys even doing here?

19:36.575 --> 19:38.035
Go back to your fancy pool. We're fine.

19:38.310 --> 19:40.590
Fancy pool got... old after a while.

19:40.979 --> 19:44.319
Wait a second.
You guys didn't get into the pool, did you?

19:44.850 --> 19:45.990
- What?
- What?

19:46.218 --> 19:47.678
Oh, my God. You sons of bitches.

19:47.953 --> 19:50.263
You didn't get in.
Admit that you are low class, just like us.

19:50.656 --> 19:52.526
I'm not admitting shit
because I did get into that pool.

19:52.858 --> 19:54.788
- I just got tired of swimming in it.
- Then why are you here?

19:55.127 --> 19:57.787
- Why are you piping in, trash? You shut your mouth, trash.
- You're swimming in this...

19:58.230 --> 20:00.860
Why are you calling me trash?
I defended you earlier 'cause of these shorts.

20:01.300 --> 20:02.640
You're the ones that are trash.

20:02.901 --> 20:05.091
Sitting in the bottom of a pool
that's filled with trash, like trash.

20:05.470 --> 20:06.900
You guys are white trash.
Admit it right now.

20:07.172 --> 20:10.772
I hope you trash bags die at the bottom
of this pool like Jamie Nelson did.

20:11.343 --> 20:14.063
- Don't bring Jamie Nelson into this!
- Forget about it. Stop it.

20:14.513 --> 20:15.803
Just stop it.

for us to beat the heat tonight...
