00:07.967 --> 00:10.967
- Chloe, come on down.
It's game night.

00:12.167 --> 00:15.633
I'm tackling you first.

00:15.733 --> 00:17.833
- It's not that kind of
game night, Chloe.

00:17.933 --> 00:20.700
It's when we all get together
and have fun as a family.

00:20.800 --> 00:22.400
- Yeah, Mom and Dad
go all out.

00:22.500 --> 00:25.433
It's kinda ridiculous.

00:25.533 --> 00:27.833
- Just like your
"kissing" ringtone.

00:27.933 --> 00:31.367
- It sounds like your girlfriend
Allison is texting you.

00:31.467 --> 00:34.467
- * Max and Allison
sittin' in a tree *

00:34.567 --> 00:36.867
* K-i...

00:36.967 --> 00:39.433
Well, you know what
goes on in that tree.

00:39.533 --> 00:41.533
- Allison's not
my girlfriend.

00:41.633 --> 00:43.267
We're just hangin' out.

00:43.367 --> 00:46.800
And whoever changed
my ringtone, very funny.

00:46.900 --> 00:49.300
Seriously,
that was kinda funny.

00:49.400 --> 00:51.867
- Is she coming over so
we can all finally meet her?

00:51.967 --> 00:53.833
- No way. She's just
coming over to pick up

00:53.933 --> 00:56.333
a book to study for
our exam on Monday.

00:56.433 --> 00:58.200
I don't need books
because I invented

00:58.300 --> 00:59.900
a device to make me smarter.

01:00.067 --> 01:03.233
- Clearly, you haven't
used it yet.

01:06.167 --> 01:09.067
- Live, from our beautiful home
in downtown Hiddenville,

01:09.167 --> 01:13.267
it's Thunderman family
game night!

01:13.367 --> 01:16.067
- ALL: [cheering,
applauding]

01:16.167 --> 01:19.200
Hey!

01:19.300 --> 01:20.433
Welcome, everybody.
Thank you so much.

01:20.533 --> 01:23.167
I, of course, am your
Dad, Hank,

01:23.267 --> 01:26.700
and this is your
beautiful Mom, Barb!

01:26.800 --> 01:27.933
- Thanks, Hank.

01:28.067 --> 01:30.667
It's good to be back.

01:30.767 --> 01:33.733
- Yay, Mommy and Daddy!

01:33.833 --> 01:37.367
- Aw, she thinks
they're cool.

01:37.467 --> 01:40.967
- The game our family will
be playing tonight is

01:41.067 --> 01:43.733
"Who Arted?"

01:43.833 --> 01:47.200
- That's right,
the winning team will draw,

01:47.300 --> 01:52.400
charade, and sculpt
their way to victory.

01:52.500 --> 01:54.267
- Just get to
the prize wheel!

01:54.367 --> 01:57.267
- ALL: Prize wheel!
Prize wheel! Prize wheel!

01:57.367 --> 02:01.833
- Did someone say
"prize wheel?!"

02:01.933 --> 02:03.633
- ALL: Ooooh!

02:03.733 --> 02:06.733
- Maybe it'll finally
land on "new car."

02:06.833 --> 02:09.800
- I just don't want it to land
on "underwear shopping spree."

02:09.900 --> 02:13.900
I don't wear them, people!

02:14.067 --> 02:15.333
- Hold on, family.

02:15.433 --> 02:18.267
Chloe doesn't have a teammate
for her first game night.

02:18.367 --> 02:20.167
- HANK: That's right.

02:20.267 --> 02:23.833
- And since she just "wuvs"
her big sister, Phoebe,

02:23.933 --> 02:25.233
maybe they should
be teammates.

02:25.333 --> 02:27.467
- Yay, Phoebe!

02:27.567 --> 02:29.533
- Aw, she thinks you're cool.

02:29.633 --> 02:32.500
- Max, you and I
are usually teammates.

02:32.600 --> 02:34.500
Who are you gonna
play with?

02:34.600 --> 02:37.067
- I guess I could settle for
Colosso, unless he's busy.

02:39.833 --> 02:41.567
- He has no life.

02:41.667 --> 02:44.633
- Okay, who wants
to spin the wheel?

02:44.733 --> 02:48.567
How about this
adorable contestant?

02:50.633 --> 02:54.900
You've gotta spin it
to win it, baby!

02:57.433 --> 02:58.533
- It better not land
on "new car," Hank.

02:58.633 --> 03:00.967
We spent half our savings
on these darn outfits.

03:01.067 --> 03:02.700
- It never does.

03:02.800 --> 03:04.333
"New car" is on the wheel

03:04.433 --> 03:06.767
just to keep them
excited about the game.

03:06.867 --> 03:09.300
The chances of it landing
on it are one in a million.

03:09.400 --> 03:12.067
- KIDS: New car!!

03:12.100 --> 03:14.267
- Yay!

03:17.467 --> 03:20.200
- Yeah, we did it!

03:20.300 --> 03:23.100
I'd give you a thumbs up,
too, if I had thumbs.

03:24.700 --> 03:28.533
* A car is in my future
and it's new **

03:28.633 --> 03:30.800
- *

03:30.900 --> 03:32.067
* What you see

03:32.100 --> 03:33.467
* Is not what you get

03:33.567 --> 03:36.833
* Livin' our lives
with a secret *

03:36.933 --> 03:38.400
* We fit right in

03:38.500 --> 03:40.067
* Bet you never guessed

03:40.133 --> 03:41.367
* 'Cause we're
livin' our lives *

03:41.467 --> 03:43.133
* Just like all the rest

03:43.233 --> 03:44.933
* A picture
perfect family *

03:45.067 --> 03:47.067
* Is what we try to be

03:47.133 --> 03:48.200
* Look closer,
you might see *

03:48.300 --> 03:50.067
* The crazy things we do

03:50.133 --> 03:51.700
* This isn't
make believe *

03:51.800 --> 03:53.267
* It's our reality

03:53.367 --> 03:54.700
* Just your average family

03:54.800 --> 03:58.067
* Trying to be normal
and stay out of trouble *

03:58.100 --> 04:01.700
* Livin' a double life *

04:05.667 --> 04:08.633
- Rigging that wheel was one of
our best ideas ever, Colosso.

04:08.733 --> 04:11.300
Freakin' out Mom and Dad
is just icing on the cake.

04:11.400 --> 04:13.800
- Yeah, look at 'em,
they're all like...

04:13.900 --> 04:16.833
COLOSSO: "Hank, you said
this couldn't happen!"

04:16.933 --> 04:19.533
COLOSSO: "I just don't know
what went wrong!"

04:19.633 --> 04:21.333
- Check out Dad's face

04:21.433 --> 04:23.533
when the wheel landed
on "new car."

04:25.967 --> 04:27.833
- Oh, hey, you still
have the selfie we took

04:27.933 --> 04:29.667
when you turned me
back into a human.

04:29.767 --> 04:31.900
- Of course.
We make a great team.

04:32.067 --> 04:36.933
And when we win game night,
that car will be ours.

04:37.067 --> 04:41.933
- *

04:42.067 --> 04:43.667
- COLOSSO: Ugh...

04:43.767 --> 04:45.967
- *

04:46.067 --> 04:50.067
- Cruisin' in that car with you
and Allison's gonna be epic.

04:51.967 --> 04:53.533
That'll be...

04:53.633 --> 04:55.700
fun.

04:55.800 --> 04:59.300
- *

04:59.400 --> 05:03.167
- ALLISON: Ahhh!
- COLOSSO: Bye!

05:03.267 --> 05:05.267
Ha!

05:05.367 --> 05:07.133
- What are you up
to this time, Max?

05:07.233 --> 05:09.233
First you convince me to partner
with a four-year-old

05:09.333 --> 05:11.367
and then the wheel
lands on "new car"?

05:11.467 --> 05:12.733
This whole thing
smells fishy.

05:12.833 --> 05:16.100
- Oh, uh, that's me.
I'm covered in fish oil.

05:16.200 --> 05:19.767
My fur has never
been silkier.

05:19.867 --> 05:22.067
- I didn't do anything
to the wheel.

05:22.167 --> 05:23.800
If you don't believe me,

05:23.900 --> 05:25.800
go down to my lair
and check for evidence.

05:28.900 --> 05:29.933
- You know,
it doesn't matter.

05:30.067 --> 05:31.533
Chloe and I are
gonna win that car

05:31.633 --> 05:34.633
and go on the best
road trip ever.

05:34.733 --> 05:39.333
Next stop, the library.
* Oh oh

05:39.433 --> 05:42.433
- Best road trip ever.

05:47.067 --> 05:48.400
- My fantasy is right.

05:48.500 --> 05:50.333
I should get Chloe
to the library

05:50.433 --> 05:51.833
for a quick study sesh.

05:51.933 --> 05:53.800
- Are you fantasizing
about studying?

05:53.900 --> 05:56.067
- Are you about to get
hit with popcorn?

06:01.867 --> 06:04.767
- How cool would it be
if we had our own new car?

06:08.433 --> 06:11.300
- To the amusement
park, driver.

06:11.400 --> 06:14.333
- And don't forget
the bubbles, Coco.

06:14.433 --> 06:19.867
- *

06:19.967 --> 06:22.633
- BOTH: Cool!

06:22.733 --> 06:24.900
- We've gotta find
a way to win this game.

06:25.067 --> 06:26.567
- I have an idea.

06:26.667 --> 06:28.767
You figure out what to do
while I eat Dad's couch chips.

06:32.267 --> 06:33.833
- Hey, Max has a device

06:33.933 --> 06:36.633
to make himself smarter
for his exam.

06:36.733 --> 06:38.967
We can use it to make us
smarter for game night.

06:39.067 --> 06:41.133
I told you
my idea would work.

06:45.733 --> 06:48.300
- Well, the wheel looks
perfectly clean.

06:48.400 --> 06:50.800
- Yeah, I guess Max
didn't rig it.

06:55.367 --> 06:56.633
- We're not buying
anyone a car,

06:56.733 --> 06:58.733
so I guess there's only
one thing to do.

06:58.833 --> 07:01.067
Win game night.

07:02.500 --> 07:04.667
- We're gonna be the smartest
people in the house, Billy.

07:04.767 --> 07:07.733
After I go, you'll go.
Hit it.

07:13.500 --> 07:16.367
- Totally.

07:16.467 --> 07:19.400
Hey, you stole my bow!

07:19.500 --> 07:21.400
Ow!

07:21.500 --> 07:22.767
You can't do that!

07:22.867 --> 07:24.167
Ow!

07:24.267 --> 07:28.100
I'll show you.
- You heard her. Cut it out!

07:28.200 --> 07:29.733
Ow!

07:29.833 --> 07:30.767
Ow!

07:30.867 --> 07:33.067
- No way.

07:33.133 --> 07:34.967
Ow! Ow!

07:37.800 --> 07:40.167
- Max, come get some pizza
before we start playing.

07:40.267 --> 07:41.333
- Okay.

07:43.067 --> 07:46.500
Don't eat with the enemy.
- Right.

07:46.600 --> 07:47.667
Let's do a little warm-up

07:47.767 --> 07:49.500
before we embarrass
those losers.

07:49.600 --> 07:52.067
- I don't think
we need it, but, okay.

07:52.167 --> 07:55.100
Guess this clue.
Yeah. Okay. Uh-huh.

07:55.200 --> 07:57.067
Got a little bit of
this thing goin'.

07:57.167 --> 07:59.067
Curl that back around.

07:59.167 --> 08:02.567
It's a phrase.

08:02.667 --> 08:04.833
- Man, we're gonna lose.

08:07.933 --> 08:10.600
- Your stupid girlfriend's
here for her book.

08:10.700 --> 08:14.067
- She's not my girlfriend.

08:14.100 --> 08:17.267
- You're twirling
in a cologne cloud?

08:17.367 --> 08:19.467
Who are you?

08:19.567 --> 08:21.367
Ugh.

08:21.467 --> 08:23.867
- Hey, you.
- Hey.

08:23.967 --> 08:25.567
Thanks. How's
game night going?

08:25.667 --> 08:28.400
- Oh, good. About to
play "Who Arted?"

08:28.500 --> 08:29.933
- Oh, I love that game!

08:30.067 --> 08:32.200
At summer camp, we played
"Who Arted?" all the time.

08:32.300 --> 08:36.367
I would cut loose and rip
out a win every week.

08:39.067 --> 08:42.167
How would you like to be
my partner for game night?

08:42.267 --> 08:44.067
- Yeah.

08:44.167 --> 08:46.067
- Guess someone's finally ready
for me to meet his family.

08:46.100 --> 08:48.267
- Well, you gotta
meet 'em to beat 'em.

08:48.367 --> 08:49.767
What do you say?

08:49.867 --> 08:51.600
- Yeah. Just give me
a second to call my mom.

08:51.700 --> 08:54.100
- All right. See ya
in there, partner.

08:56.833 --> 08:58.700
- Hi, Mom, I'm gonna
hang out at Max's.

08:58.800 --> 09:00.633
He finally wants me
to meet his family.

09:00.733 --> 09:02.533
I told you I was
his girlfriend.

09:06.500 --> 09:09.233
- COLOSSO:
Hey! Hey! Hey!

09:09.333 --> 09:10.967
Hey, what are you doing?

09:11.067 --> 09:13.067
- Sorry, Colosso, I've got
a partner who can draw

09:13.100 --> 09:14.067
and doesn't smell like fish.

09:14.167 --> 09:17.167
- You'll regret this!

09:18.667 --> 09:20.067
- It's game time!

09:20.167 --> 09:22.067
- Hey, what'd you
do to Colosso?

09:22.133 --> 09:25.267
- Mind your own business.
Got a new partner.

09:30.433 --> 09:33.833
- Ohhhh...this must be--

09:33.933 --> 09:36.900
- Ignore her. She's trying
to psyche us out.

09:38.833 --> 09:40.633
He can't just switch partners
at the last minute.

09:40.733 --> 09:42.567
Can't you see
he's up to something?

09:42.667 --> 09:44.600
- One less supervillain
playing for a car.

09:44.700 --> 09:46.933
We'll allow it.

09:51.067 --> 09:52.933
- Bedtime story!
- Yes!

09:55.933 --> 09:58.467
- HANK: Billy and Nora,
your turn.

09:58.567 --> 10:03.367
Let's see what you got.

10:03.467 --> 10:06.100
- A pen! A boy with a pen!

10:06.200 --> 10:08.933
A boy with a pen
who's staring at me!

10:09.033 --> 10:11.067
- I haven't even
started drawing yet.

10:11.167 --> 10:15.767
- Submarine! Gumbo! Church!
Home for the holidays!

10:15.867 --> 10:17.567
- Someone else go

10:17.667 --> 10:19.600
so I don't have to
explain what's happening.

10:19.700 --> 10:22.267
- All right, Chloe, we're up.

10:22.367 --> 10:24.267
Thank you.

10:24.367 --> 10:26.033
All right.

10:26.133 --> 10:27.900
Okay.

10:38.267 --> 10:41.033
- This is hard to watch,
but I can't look away.

10:49.933 --> 10:52.900
- It's "heart" and "soul."

10:53.000 --> 10:56.200
- HANK: Noooo!
- BARB: It's really not.

10:56.300 --> 10:58.900
- Don't worry, Chloe.
We'll just win the next one.

10:59.000 --> 11:02.400
- I'm bored. I'm gonna
go see my dollies.

11:02.500 --> 11:05.067
- Whoa, wait, Chloe.

11:05.100 --> 11:08.200
- Aw, tough break, Phoebe.
- Yeah.

11:08.300 --> 11:10.200
- Yes! Now all we have to do
is beat Max and Allison

11:10.300 --> 11:12.067
and we get a new car.
- Hank.

11:12.133 --> 11:14.133
- I mean, we don't have
to buy a new car.

11:14.233 --> 11:17.267
Sorry, there's
a lot goin' on.

11:17.367 --> 11:18.567
- Nice try, Max.

11:18.667 --> 11:20.067
I'm gonna find
another partner.

11:20.100 --> 11:21.600
You're not gettin'
rid of me that easy.

11:21.700 --> 11:23.500
- It's not my fault
Chloe ditched you.

11:23.600 --> 11:27.067
I'd never do that.

11:27.167 --> 11:31.300
- Oh, please, you already
ditched Coloss--oh!

11:31.400 --> 11:34.233
- *

11:34.333 --> 11:36.967
- Oh, I'll get it.

11:37.067 --> 11:39.667
That's my new teammate.

11:39.767 --> 11:44.267
- Hello, family!

11:44.367 --> 11:47.867
Uncle Colosso's
here for game night.

11:49.867 --> 11:52.067
- COLOSSO & PHOEBE:
You're goin' down.

11:57.833 --> 12:00.933
- Uncle Colosso,
what are you doing up here?

12:01.067 --> 12:03.767
In here. Here. Just here.

12:03.867 --> 12:07.067
- I'm here to help
my dear niece win this game.

12:07.167 --> 12:10.300
- Hello, it's nice to meet
another member of Max's family.

12:10.400 --> 12:13.967
Not that I've technically
met anyone else.

12:14.067 --> 12:17.100
- I thought this was supposed
to be "family" game night.

12:19.967 --> 12:25.733
Barbara, still
as ravishing as ever.

12:25.833 --> 12:28.333
Mmmmm!
- Ew! Ew! Okay, no! No!

12:28.433 --> 12:30.900
Phoebe, I'd like to talk to
you in the kitchen, please.

12:31.067 --> 12:32.533
What about?

12:32.633 --> 12:34.267
- Phoebe. Kitchen. Now!

12:39.733 --> 12:42.867
- You two look smaller
than I remember.

12:42.967 --> 12:44.767
- Come on, Nora,
let's sneak downstairs

12:44.867 --> 12:46.833
and fix your brain
while no one's looking.

12:50.100 --> 12:52.500
- We're going to fix
my brain, so nobody look!

12:57.333 --> 12:59.833
- So...this is weird.

13:00.067 --> 13:01.500
- What are you
talking about?

13:01.600 --> 13:02.533
- Him.

13:07.800 --> 13:09.467
- Hey, you want a quick
tour of the house?

13:09.567 --> 13:10.667
- Oh, I'd love one.

13:10.767 --> 13:12.333
- Yeah, well,
start with the back.

13:13.867 --> 13:16.067
- Well, I've seen
it already.

13:17.867 --> 13:19.667
What are you doing?

13:19.767 --> 13:20.833
- Looking for some
shredded newspaper.

13:20.933 --> 13:22.867
That was a lot of water,

13:22.967 --> 13:25.233
and I don't wanna ruin
Lady Barbara's couch.

13:25.333 --> 13:27.667
- Of all people,
you teamed up with Phoebe?

13:27.767 --> 13:29.500
I thought we were
best friends.

13:29.600 --> 13:31.700
- We were till ya ditched me
for Little Miss Bright Eyes.

13:31.800 --> 13:34.167
- Ah, her eyes are
amazing, aren't they?

13:34.267 --> 13:35.533
- Ick.

13:35.633 --> 13:37.733
The point is, Phoebe's
my new best friend now.

13:37.833 --> 13:39.667
All right, I still
can't stand her,

13:39.767 --> 13:41.600
but I am gonna help
her win that car,

13:41.700 --> 13:43.167
so you can't get it!

13:43.267 --> 13:44.867
Traitor!
- You're the traitor!

13:44.967 --> 13:46.533
- You're the traitor!
- You teamed up with Phoebe!

13:46.633 --> 13:47.833
- You threw me down the chute!

13:47.933 --> 13:49.233
- All right, I think
I've finally got

13:49.333 --> 13:52.733
all the Colosso cooties
off my hand.

13:52.833 --> 13:55.200
- Honestly, Phoebe,
what were you thinking?

13:55.300 --> 13:58.500
Using the Animalizer to
turn Colosso human?

13:58.600 --> 14:01.900
- One word. I want a car.

14:02.067 --> 14:04.433
- Two words.
I'm changin' him back.

14:04.533 --> 14:06.633
And you're outta the game.

14:06.733 --> 14:08.133
- Dad, that's not fair.

14:08.233 --> 14:10.100
You can't just kick me out
of family game night.

14:10.200 --> 14:12.400
- Um, Hank, come over here.

14:12.500 --> 14:13.833
- There is no way
I'm lettin' you win!

14:13.933 --> 14:15.333
- There's no way
I'm lettin' you win!

14:15.433 --> 14:17.800
- You traitor.
- It takes one to know one!

14:21.900 --> 14:23.733
- Colosso can stay.

14:23.833 --> 14:26.200
- Dad, thank you!
Thank you.

14:26.300 --> 14:28.767
- And when those two teams
take each other down,

14:28.867 --> 14:30.467
we win the game!

14:30.567 --> 14:32.867
- And then it's, hello, new car.

14:32.967 --> 14:34.933
- I knew it was wrong
the second I said it.

14:37.267 --> 14:39.200
- Oh, here's the problem.

14:39.300 --> 14:40.867
This thing was
set to "stupid."

14:40.967 --> 14:43.067
Why would Max even
make that a setting?

14:44.933 --> 14:48.233
I like it when
my eyes fart fire.

14:48.333 --> 14:51.300
- Okay, I see why he did it.

14:51.400 --> 14:54.867
Right, all we have to do
is set this thing to "smart."

15:02.933 --> 15:06.100
- Now you're definitely smart
enough to win us that car.

15:06.200 --> 15:09.433
- Je suis super
intelligent, Billy.

15:09.533 --> 15:10.867
Je parle le français.

15:10.967 --> 15:12.667
Pourquoi je parle
le français?

15:12.767 --> 15:15.633
- You're speaking French.
Why are you speaking French?

15:15.733 --> 15:18.533
- HANK: Kids, get up here
or you're out of the game!

15:18.633 --> 15:22.067
- BARB: Hurry up. The next
category is French culture.

15:23.833 --> 15:25.333
- French culture.

15:25.433 --> 15:27.200
You're good at that
now, right?

15:27.300 --> 15:30.067
- Oui, oui.
- You can wee-wee later.

15:30.133 --> 15:32.133
Focus on the question.

15:32.233 --> 15:36.067
Are you good at
French culture?

15:43.433 --> 15:44.833
- La tour Eiffel.

15:44.933 --> 15:48.667
- Wrong! Eiffel Tower.

15:48.767 --> 15:49.967
- Hank, she said
it in French.

15:50.067 --> 15:51.933
She's showboating.

15:52.067 --> 15:54.533
- Ten points for
Billy and Nora.

15:54.633 --> 15:56.100
All right, Phoebe,

15:56.200 --> 15:58.067
you and your very annoying
uncle are up next.

15:58.100 --> 15:59.500
- MAX: This is awful.

15:59.600 --> 16:01.467
We should have this game
in the bag by now.

16:01.567 --> 16:03.333
- Okay, I think
maybe I should go.

16:03.433 --> 16:05.167
I wanted to meet
your family,

16:05.267 --> 16:06.867
but this is getting
really intense.

16:06.967 --> 16:08.733
I'm not intense.

16:08.833 --> 16:10.433
I just wanna win!

16:10.533 --> 16:15.133
- Forgive me.

16:15.233 --> 16:19.267
It's like I'm not in
control of my own limbs.

16:19.367 --> 16:21.300
- Oh, our turn.

16:21.400 --> 16:23.467
Now, go sculpt me a masterpiece
so we can win this thing.

16:27.300 --> 16:28.833
- I have had it with you.

16:28.933 --> 16:31.667
I can't use my powers right
now, but I can do this.

16:31.767 --> 16:36.067
- Ow!

16:36.167 --> 16:37.800
- Ow!

16:37.900 --> 16:39.433
- You can't do that
to my partner!

16:39.533 --> 16:42.433
- Don't hit me, you traitor!

16:42.533 --> 16:43.833
- COLOSSO: Eat the pillow,
you backstabber!

16:43.933 --> 16:45.133
Ahhhhh!

16:45.233 --> 16:48.333
- HANK: Hey!
Don't hit the little ones.

16:48.433 --> 16:52.067
- Fine, I'll hit the big one.

16:52.167 --> 16:56.133
- BARB: Those are my good
pillows, you stupid rabbit--

16:56.233 --> 17:01.067
--breeder!
He's a rabbit breeder!

17:04.967 --> 17:07.667
- CHLOE: Stop it!

17:07.767 --> 17:11.300
Be nice!

17:13.167 --> 17:14.300
- COLOSSO: Max started it.

17:14.400 --> 17:16.200
- Yeah, he's a liar
and a cheater.

17:16.300 --> 17:17.533
You don't deserve to
win that car, Max.

17:17.633 --> 17:20.067
You brought in your girlfriend,
the game night wizard.

17:20.133 --> 17:23.400
- I told you she's
not my girlfriend.

17:26.867 --> 17:28.867
I feel like such an idiot.

17:38.900 --> 17:42.967
- Max, I think I speak for
everyone here when I say...

17:43.067 --> 17:47.067
you don't need her!
Good riddance!

17:50.867 --> 17:54.767
I've been
waiting to do that all night.

17:54.867 --> 17:57.433
- Heh...well,
goodnight.

17:57.533 --> 18:01.667
If you need me, I'll be down
in the lair hating you all.

18:01.767 --> 18:03.367
Hmph!

18:06.067 --> 18:08.600
- I don't know
what just happened.

18:08.700 --> 18:10.867
- Let a girl
explain it to you.

18:10.967 --> 18:13.900
She's your girlfriend!

18:14.067 --> 18:15.767
- Think about it, Max.

18:15.867 --> 18:17.400
Every time you see her,

18:17.500 --> 18:19.400
you're all worried
about how you smell.

18:19.500 --> 18:21.367
- And you talk about
her all the time.

18:21.467 --> 18:23.067
- You see her every day.

18:23.100 --> 18:26.167
- And you get that look in your
eye when you think about her.

18:26.267 --> 18:28.067
That's it.

18:28.100 --> 18:29.700
The same look
your father gets

18:29.800 --> 18:31.833
when he finds potato chips
in the furniture.

18:36.667 --> 18:41.533
- Max, you went to all that
trouble to win the car.

18:41.633 --> 18:43.233
What were you gonna
do with it?

18:43.333 --> 18:46.067
- Ride around with Allison.

18:46.100 --> 18:48.767
Oh, man, she is
my girlfriend.

18:48.867 --> 18:50.700
- BARB:

18:56.267 --> 18:59.100
Are you stealing
my sister's roller skates?

18:59.200 --> 19:01.500
- No, my bike's got a flat.

19:01.600 --> 19:03.833
I think something chewed
a hole in my tire.

19:03.933 --> 19:07.467
- Take that, Bright Eyes.

19:09.867 --> 19:12.700
- Look, Allison, I'm...

19:12.800 --> 19:13.967
I'm so sorry.

19:14.067 --> 19:15.733
- For using me for
a stupid car?

19:15.833 --> 19:16.867
- For everything.

19:16.967 --> 19:19.600
And the only reason
I wanted that stupid car

19:19.700 --> 19:23.133
was so I could
go places with you.

19:23.233 --> 19:26.133
- Yeah.

19:26.233 --> 19:29.200
Look, the truth is...

19:29.300 --> 19:32.300
I've never even had
a real girlfriend before.

19:32.400 --> 19:36.067
But if I was going
to have one,

19:36.133 --> 19:38.667
I'd want her to be you.

19:38.767 --> 19:40.500
- ALL: Awwww...

19:48.067 --> 19:49.900
- Yes!

19:50.067 --> 19:51.833
And next time, tell me I'm
your game night wizard.

19:51.933 --> 19:54.867
I'll bring my A-game, fool.

19:58.867 --> 20:02.467
We're coming back in now!
- BARB: Go! Go! Go! Go!

20:07.633 --> 20:14.267
- Mom, Dad, everyone,
meet my girlfriend, Allison.

20:14.367 --> 20:18.767
- Hi. Again.

20:18.867 --> 20:22.167
- Well, it's a pleasure
to meet you, Allison.

20:22.267 --> 20:25.200
- Oh.

20:25.300 --> 20:26.967
It's my mom.
I've gotta get home.

20:27.067 --> 20:28.367
It was so nice
to finally meet you.

20:28.467 --> 20:31.900
But you understand if I meet Max
on the porch from now on.

20:32.000 --> 20:33.733
- Yeah.
- We get it.

20:38.933 --> 20:40.567
- Um...

20:44.067 --> 20:45.733
- Right.

20:49.133 --> 20:52.033
- Save it for the tree!

20:52.133 --> 20:55.167
- HANK: Bye, Allison.
- PHOEBE: See ya.

20:55.267 --> 20:58.000
Well, I guess that means
game night's over.

20:58.100 --> 20:59.900
Wait. Who won the car?

21:00.067 --> 21:03.500
- Well, since you and Max
cheated, you two are out.

21:03.600 --> 21:06.267
And that puts your Dad
and I in second place!

21:06.367 --> 21:07.500
- No, Nora and I
came in second

21:07.600 --> 21:10.433
after our comeback
in the last round.

21:10.533 --> 21:14.400
- I guess that means you
have to buy them a car.

21:14.500 --> 21:19.267
You know you're
my favorite sister, right?

21:19.367 --> 21:20.667
- Merci, Phoebe.

21:29.133 --> 21:32.967
- Wait, did you two mess with
the machine down in my lair?

21:33.067 --> 21:35.833
- Je ne comprends pas.

21:35.933 --> 21:39.833
- Sweet! I am totally
gonna pass my French exam.

21:39.933 --> 21:43.700
But all you guys need to know
is that they cheated.

21:43.800 --> 21:47.133
- That means we don't
have to buy a car!

21:47.233 --> 21:48.533
Thank goodness each
one of you kids

21:48.633 --> 21:51.933
is a terrible,
stinkin' cheater!

21:53.867 --> 21:56.267
Your mother and I have never
been more proud of you guys.

22:00.433 --> 22:02.500
Sorry, Coco,
we're not getting the car.

22:10.767 --> 22:26.533
- *
