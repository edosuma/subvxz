THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN PAST,
PRESENT AND FUTURE

00:15.000 --> 00:17.916
IS ONLY A STUBBORNLY
PERSISTENT ILLUSION. ALBERT EINSTEIN

00:24.708 --> 00:30.416
We trust that time is linear.

00:33.416 --> 00:38.125
That it proceeds eternally, uniformly.

00:39.083 --> 00:40.500
Into infinity.

00:44.541 --> 00:49.833
But the distinction between past, present

00:49.916 --> 00:51.666
and future

00:52.208 --> 00:54.833
is nothing but an illusion.

00:57.041 --> 01:02.791
Yesterday, today and tomorrow
are not consecutive,

01:03.666 --> 01:09.125
they are connected
in a never-ending circle.

01:10.625 --> 01:14.708
Everything is connected.

01:23.708 --> 01:26.750
JUNE 21, 2019

02:26.125 --> 02:28.833
DO NOT OPEN
BEFORE NOVEMBER 4, 10:13 P.M.

04:39.666 --> 04:44.333
SECRETS

04:45.583 --> 04:49.375
NOVEMBER 4, 2019

05:13.000 --> 05:13.833
Fuck.

05:15.000 --> 05:16.416
Mom.

05:19.083 --> 05:20.041
Mom!

05:22.333 --> 05:25.125
You'd think by 16,
they'd know how to make toast.

05:27.041 --> 05:28.166
Mom!

05:28.250 --> 05:30.083
The power's out again.

05:31.541 --> 05:32.583
Mom!

05:36.625 --> 05:38.375
Thanks for breakfast.

05:49.166 --> 05:50.916
Coming to the meeting tonight?

05:52.541 --> 05:53.833
I don't know.

05:54.375 --> 05:56.916
-Katharina will be there.
-And I'll be there.

05:57.833 --> 05:59.666
Yes, you'll be there.

05:59.750 --> 06:01.208
That's right.

06:10.791 --> 06:11.833
Ulrich.

06:12.500 --> 06:13.750
I love you.

06:26.208 --> 06:27.583
You're beautiful.

07:37.041 --> 07:38.791
MISSING

07:56.000 --> 07:59.125
WINDEN CAVES 0.6 MILES

08:16.875 --> 08:17.708
How was it?

08:19.000 --> 08:21.250
How have you been these last two months?

08:27.041 --> 08:29.916
You don't have to talk about it
if you don't want.

08:31.083 --> 08:33.666
I read the notes
from your therapy sessions.

08:34.375 --> 08:37.500
You did pretty good,
especially in the group sessions .

08:39.458 --> 08:40.458
I still see him.

08:43.041 --> 08:44.041
In your dreams?

08:47.458 --> 08:48.875
Why do you think you see him?

08:50.625 --> 08:52.958
As my therapist, shouldn't you tell me?

08:54.041 --> 08:55.541
Are you taking your meds?

09:00.791 --> 09:02.791
I think he's trying to tell me something.

09:03.791 --> 09:06.500
Or maybe I just want him
to tell me something.

09:06.583 --> 09:08.291
What do you think that might be?

09:15.208 --> 09:16.875
What do I think it might be?

09:17.708 --> 09:18.541
Why?

09:19.541 --> 09:20.833
Why he left?

09:21.458 --> 09:23.083
Why like that?

09:23.708 --> 09:26.166
Why he fucking hanged himself?

09:26.250 --> 09:28.333
And why he didn't leave a word?

09:28.416 --> 09:30.583
Nothing to explain this fucking crap!

09:42.583 --> 09:45.333
DO NOT OPEN
BEFORE NOVEMBER 4, 10:13 P.M.

09:56.041 --> 09:59.541
The Winden nuclear power plant
has a long history.

09:59.625 --> 10:04.625
Plans to erect the nuclear power plant
go back as far as 1953.

10:04.708 --> 10:09.333
Construction was first authorized in 1960
after the Atomic Energy Act was passed.

10:09.416 --> 10:13.875
As part of the government's staggered plan
to phase out nuclear energy,

10:13.958 --> 10:18.000
the Winden power plant
will be taken off the grid in 2020,

10:18.083 --> 10:22.958
making it one of Germany's power plants
with the longest failure-free operation.

10:28.958 --> 10:31.250
Mikkel,
you're not going to school like that.

10:31.333 --> 10:33.500
A good magician needs a distinctive style.

10:33.583 --> 10:35.583
Change your clothes. Thank you.

10:35.666 --> 10:37.458
These are my work clothes.

10:37.916 --> 10:39.500
And school sucks!

10:39.583 --> 10:41.791
I'm sure the great Hodini went to school.

10:41.875 --> 10:44.375
-Houdini! It's not that hard!
-Come have breakfast.

10:44.458 --> 10:47.458
-The greatest magician ever.
-Are you sure he's not adopted?

10:47.541 --> 10:50.333
-And his name is Houdini!
-Same crap every morning.

10:51.416 --> 10:53.250
Mom, where's my black hoodie?

10:53.333 --> 10:55.208
I don't know. Maybe with the jackets.

10:55.291 --> 10:57.166
Magnus, stop trampling like that!

10:57.250 --> 10:59.083
-Morning, Mikkel.
-Good morning.

10:59.166 --> 11:01.333
Ulrich! Why did it take so long?

11:01.416 --> 11:04.458
First day of school.
A huge line at the bakery.

11:04.666 --> 11:07.333
The Apocalypse is upon us.
You coming to eat?

11:07.416 --> 11:09.041
It's not with the jackets.

11:09.125 --> 11:10.291
Ouch!

11:10.375 --> 11:14.375
-Then maybe it's in your gym bag.
-What's going on here now? Magnus?

11:15.541 --> 11:18.125
-Breakfast.
-Mom, I'm on hunger strike.

11:18.208 --> 11:21.916
I won't stuff my face as long as a child
starves to death every ten seconds.

11:22.041 --> 11:23.166
I will.

11:23.791 --> 11:25.750
The damn hoodie isn't in the bag.

11:28.458 --> 11:30.541
-Did you steal my hoodie?
-No, I did not!

11:30.625 --> 11:34.208
-Can't you stop arguing for once?
-Mom, I didn't do anything.

11:34.583 --> 11:37.625
-Where can it be?
-Can I please have my lines back?

11:38.833 --> 11:41.291
Magnus, maybe it's up in the laundry.

11:41.375 --> 11:43.458
Martha, starving won't help anyone.

11:43.541 --> 11:46.166
Mikkel, get changed now. Last warning!

11:46.250 --> 11:48.666
-Or we'll be late.
-Whose idea was it to have kids?

11:48.750 --> 11:51.500
-Can you please open this?
-You're in the way!

11:52.791 --> 11:54.291
Did you understand me?

11:55.583 --> 11:57.166
All right then, Houdini.

11:59.833 --> 12:01.916
One last trick, then off to school.

12:02.041 --> 12:04.583
Fine, then everyone can do as they wish.

12:06.458 --> 12:07.291
Found it!

12:13.041 --> 12:13.875
Okay.

12:14.875 --> 12:15.791
There...

12:16.500 --> 12:17.375
and there.

12:30.291 --> 12:32.666
Amazing! How did you do that?

12:33.250 --> 12:35.083
Dad, the question isn't how,

12:35.583 --> 12:37.208
the question is when.

12:51.750 --> 12:52.666
Hey!

12:53.958 --> 12:55.666
Welcome back to the madhouse.

12:55.750 --> 12:57.583
It was damn boring without you here.

13:00.750 --> 13:04.000
-Hey, what the hell are you staring at?
-What a freak.

13:04.500 --> 13:05.833
What idiots.

13:06.750 --> 13:08.000
Did you tell anyone?

13:09.458 --> 13:12.833
I told everyone you were
on a two-month school exchange in France,

13:12.916 --> 13:15.083
playing hide-the-baguette.

13:23.250 --> 13:25.166
Relax. Come on.

13:25.250 --> 13:27.291
It'll be fine. Let's go.

13:28.125 --> 13:29.208
Come on.

13:30.041 --> 13:32.625
-What about here?
-You didn't miss much.

13:32.708 --> 13:34.541
Except for the thing with Erik.

13:42.125 --> 13:43.666
You don't give a shit!

13:43.750 --> 13:47.041
Why is nobody doing anything?
Where is our son? Where is Erik?

13:47.583 --> 13:48.791
Mr. Obendorf.

13:49.250 --> 13:52.875
No one is unimportant to us here.
We've done 172 interviews.

13:52.958 --> 13:56.500
We've questioned neighbors and friends,
combed the entire forest,

13:56.583 --> 13:59.375
searched the houses and basements
of nearby residents.

13:59.458 --> 14:02.583
23 officers and over 50 volunteers

14:02.666 --> 14:04.625
have been searching for your son for days.

14:04.708 --> 14:07.791
We're doing our job.
And we'll do it better if you calm down.

14:07.875 --> 14:10.166
-You're not doing shit!
-Hey!

14:11.208 --> 14:13.291
Calm down!
Stop. Calm down now.

14:13.375 --> 14:14.875
Hey! Come now.

14:15.583 --> 14:16.791
Listen.

14:17.250 --> 14:20.541
We can't rule out the possibility
that no crime has been committed.

14:20.625 --> 14:23.916
-What's that supposed to mean?
-Maybe Erik left voluntarily.

14:24.041 --> 14:25.250
He's done it before.

14:25.333 --> 14:28.416
But when he ran away,
he always came back after two days.

14:28.500 --> 14:32.000
-He'd sleep in the basement or wherever.
-It's been 13 days.

14:33.416 --> 14:35.875
It's been 13 days now.

14:39.708 --> 14:41.208
We'll find your son, I promise.

14:42.708 --> 14:44.833
Now go home. Okay?

14:45.416 --> 14:46.625
Go home.

15:39.458 --> 15:40.458
Franziska.

15:41.000 --> 15:42.083
Magnus.

15:42.833 --> 15:44.375
Shouldn't you be with the geeks?

15:44.833 --> 15:48.541
Should the principal's son
be smoking a joint on school grounds?

15:56.750 --> 15:58.083
Especially such bad weed.

16:11.708 --> 16:15.750
Assemblies like this are for idiots.
They need to get rid of them.

16:34.833 --> 16:37.291
Maybe you did miss something.

16:43.291 --> 16:44.125
Hey.

16:45.208 --> 16:46.041
Hey.

16:48.750 --> 16:49.791
How was France?

16:51.500 --> 16:53.208
French. How else?

17:02.708 --> 17:04.916
What a nice welcome. Thank you.

17:06.166 --> 17:09.375
The reason I've asked you
to assemble here before class

17:09.458 --> 17:13.041
is because I wanted to talk to you
about something important.

17:13.500 --> 17:14.916
About Erik Obendorf.

17:16.583 --> 17:19.750
You all know Erik has been missing
for almost two weeks now.

17:20.416 --> 17:23.583
I want to tell you
that if you need to talk to someone,

17:23.666 --> 17:27.666
if you have questions or if you know
anything about Erik's disappearance,

17:27.750 --> 17:30.416
you can come to us at any time.

17:30.500 --> 17:32.375
Come to us, talk to us.

17:32.458 --> 17:34.791
There can be no secrets in this matter.

17:35.625 --> 17:36.875
Okay?

17:38.333 --> 17:41.416
No one saw him after practice.
Not a trace, nothing.

17:41.791 --> 17:45.166
-As if he vanished into thin air.
-Maybe he just doesn't want to be found.

17:45.250 --> 17:48.625
The money under the bed? His phone?
You'd take that if you were running away.

17:49.541 --> 17:51.041
Sometimes people just want to get away.

17:55.041 --> 17:58.416
49 tire tracks on the road between
the school and the residential area.

17:58.500 --> 18:00.708
Two of them are from trucks.

18:00.791 --> 18:04.875
There are 21,312 vehicles registered
in the district of Winden alone.

18:06.041 --> 18:08.958
-That's all we have.
-So we've got nothing at all.

18:10.083 --> 18:11.833
Erik's father drives a van.

18:12.333 --> 18:14.125
You don't think he's involved.

18:15.333 --> 18:18.083
Why are you so certain Erik ran away?

18:18.416 --> 18:20.125
This is Winden.

18:20.208 --> 18:23.791
-Nothing ever happens here.
-But that hasn't always been the case.

18:25.583 --> 18:29.000
This has nothing to do with my brother.

18:29.791 --> 18:31.333
Not a thing.

18:38.666 --> 18:41.541
Oh, your mother called
the emergency number again this morning.

18:42.041 --> 18:43.958
Maybe you should pay her a visit.

18:45.208 --> 18:48.166
Do you ever wonder
where you took a wrong turn?

18:48.708 --> 18:52.625
Where your life became the exact opposite
of what you always wanted it to be?

19:07.333 --> 19:09.791
FOREST HOTEL WINDEN

19:30.250 --> 19:33.916
Hotel Winden. Regina Tiedemann speaking.
How can I help you?

19:44.041 --> 19:47.291
I see, but surely
there's something we can do.

19:47.375 --> 19:50.250
Temporarily suspend
the loan repayments, for example.

19:55.666 --> 19:59.875
Just a slight deferment of payments
until things have calmed down again here.

20:01.125 --> 20:04.916
I have not miscalculated.
Are you even listening to me?

20:05.000 --> 20:08.791
Who wants to go on vacation in a town
where a child has disappeared?

20:08.875 --> 20:10.375
Would you want that?

20:10.458 --> 20:12.833
I have a family suite available.

20:12.916 --> 20:16.083
A weekend with the little ones?
They'd love it, wouldn't they?

20:16.166 --> 20:19.666
You bankers sit on your piles of money
and think you can bully people.

20:20.250 --> 20:22.875
I've built up a business here.
By myself. Without any help.

20:22.958 --> 20:25.666
My husband and I have been
customers of your bank for 20 years!

20:25.750 --> 20:27.958
And now you're pulling this?
You stupid asshole!

20:28.041 --> 20:30.125
I want to speak to your supervisor.

20:31.375 --> 20:32.458
Hello?

20:32.583 --> 20:33.458
Hello?

20:35.208 --> 20:36.583
Shit, shit, shit!

20:44.083 --> 20:45.875
A black hole forms

20:45.958 --> 20:49.916
when the center of a star collapses
into itself after a supernova explosion.

20:50.041 --> 20:52.791
Even new neutron matter
cannot prevent the collapse.

20:52.875 --> 20:55.375
You know
what I've been wondering for days?

20:55.458 --> 20:59.166
If the blackest hole of all
is parked in Franziska Doppler's ass.

21:05.208 --> 21:08.125
But, seriously,
what I really wonder is this:

21:08.208 --> 21:12.208
If Erik didn't run away,
but got snuffed out or something instead,

21:12.291 --> 21:14.458
then all his dope is still in the caves.

21:16.958 --> 21:18.833
He kept his entire stash there.

21:20.041 --> 21:21.791
-So?
-Oh, man!

21:21.875 --> 21:24.333
We go in there and... bingo!

21:26.041 --> 21:28.041
-That's bullshit.
-It's awesome.

21:34.291 --> 21:36.291
You haven't been here in a long time.

21:37.416 --> 21:38.416
Where's Dad?

21:39.625 --> 21:41.625
You could come by more often.

21:42.458 --> 21:46.458
Mom, if you want me to stop by
then call me, not the emergency number.

21:48.208 --> 21:49.958
I saw something in the forest again.

21:51.041 --> 21:53.000
This time very clearly.

21:53.083 --> 21:56.000
A dark figure with a gigantic head.

21:57.833 --> 21:58.833
Mom.

21:59.458 --> 22:01.208
You don't believe me.

22:02.166 --> 22:05.333
There are things out there
that our little minds

22:06.250 --> 22:07.583
will never comprehend.

22:17.791 --> 22:20.458
And I found this in the forest.

22:23.458 --> 22:25.208
Mads loved those.

22:29.375 --> 22:31.875
This business with that missing Erik...

22:31.958 --> 22:32.916
FOR MOTHER'S DAY 1986

22:33.000 --> 22:35.041
...like with your brother, back then.

22:35.125 --> 22:36.750
Everything's repeating itself.

22:38.250 --> 22:40.791
Everything is just like it was
33 years ago.

22:46.791 --> 22:48.791
REST HOME WINDEN

22:51.291 --> 22:52.666
It's going to happen again.

22:54.458 --> 22:56.000
It's going to happen again.

22:57.458 --> 22:59.208
It's going to happen again.

23:45.500 --> 23:47.833
Bullshit.
Then you'll go around selling it or what?

23:47.916 --> 23:50.000
No, dude.
We'll smoke half of it ourselves.

23:50.083 --> 23:53.333
And if there are capacities on the market,
you don't hesitate.

23:53.416 --> 23:55.500
We'll go there and get the stuff.

23:55.583 --> 23:57.041
Easy peasy.

23:57.500 --> 23:59.041
Who's getting what stuff?

23:59.125 --> 24:01.083
We're going to the caves tonight.

24:02.333 --> 24:05.791
-You turning into boy scouts?
-Bartosz thinks Erik's dope is there.

24:06.833 --> 24:10.125
Fanny told me they once found
a dead squirrel with five legs there.

24:10.208 --> 24:12.041
You'll believe any old crap.

24:12.666 --> 24:14.708
Just because you can't see past your nose

24:14.791 --> 24:17.666
doesn't mean
there aren't things going on out there

24:17.750 --> 24:20.916
that the nuclear power mafia
keeps secret from the public.

24:21.041 --> 24:22.625
Don't forget to breathe.

24:24.708 --> 24:25.666
Franziska.

24:26.333 --> 24:27.208
Magnus.

24:29.166 --> 24:31.416
-You got a crush on her now or what?
-Shut up.

24:31.500 --> 24:33.916
-Hey, idiot.
-Okay, what the hell.

24:34.041 --> 24:36.791
-Let's go to the caves tonight and look.
-Yeah, dude!

24:37.708 --> 24:38.541
Come on.

24:52.083 --> 24:53.666
Can't even hold out half a day?

24:54.041 --> 24:55.666
Impossible. I'm dying.

24:57.291 --> 24:58.458
You coming later?

24:59.416 --> 25:00.708
I don't know.

25:02.291 --> 25:03.625
Everyone will be there.

25:03.708 --> 25:05.125
Gawking at me.

25:06.250 --> 25:09.958
I'll be in Frankfurt this weekend
for training, staying in a hotel.

25:10.041 --> 25:11.625
And...

25:12.000 --> 25:15.041
-Um... Yeah, I thought...
-You thought?

25:17.250 --> 25:18.500
Don't think too long,

25:18.583 --> 25:20.208
I have various candidates.

25:22.625 --> 25:24.750
-See you later.
- Maybe.

26:23.500 --> 26:24.500
Yes, right there.

26:25.333 --> 26:27.000
It's totally knotted up.

26:29.208 --> 26:30.666
It's supposed to rain later.

26:31.541 --> 26:33.000
Scars sense that.

26:33.166 --> 26:35.625
They can see into the future, so to speak.

26:36.166 --> 26:38.041
The tissue hardens

26:38.625 --> 26:40.291
and cramps up.

26:41.833 --> 26:42.666
Thanks.

26:50.666 --> 26:53.875
Maybe the whole thing
is getting to me more than I thought.

26:58.291 --> 27:01.250
In a year, everything here
is meant to come to an end.

27:05.875 --> 27:09.833
Nearly 33 years ago to the day
when I came to Winden.

27:10.250 --> 27:12.708
I never thought it would end like this.

27:13.500 --> 27:16.333
But there's a time for everything.

27:16.708 --> 27:17.916
Yes.

27:18.500 --> 27:20.291
There's a time for everything.

27:24.833 --> 27:27.625
I'm sorry. About the thing with Michael.

27:28.500 --> 27:31.166
How are you doing? How's Jonas?

27:34.916 --> 27:36.041
Good.

27:37.083 --> 27:38.500
We're good.

27:42.083 --> 27:44.583
It's Hannah here. The power's out again.

27:44.666 --> 27:48.083
I mean, if you want us out of the house,
then just say so.

27:48.166 --> 27:50.375
Your grandson
hasn't seen you in over three months.

27:50.458 --> 27:52.083
Do you think Michael wanted that?

27:52.166 --> 27:53.541
That's sick.

27:54.625 --> 27:56.041
You're sick.

28:19.291 --> 28:24.083
DO NOT OPEN
BEFORE NOVEMBER 4, 10:13 P.M.

28:55.250 --> 28:56.416
Hannah!

28:56.500 --> 28:58.000
How nice.

28:58.875 --> 29:01.041
We haven't seen each other for ages.

29:03.291 --> 29:04.875
How are you?

29:05.416 --> 29:06.500
Okay.

29:07.458 --> 29:10.333
Yeah, well, you know... I'm okay.

29:11.541 --> 29:12.666
Good.

29:13.375 --> 29:15.375
Go inside. I'll be right in, okay?

30:08.083 --> 30:09.333
Hi.

30:10.041 --> 30:11.083
Hi.

30:17.541 --> 30:19.500
Where are Bartosz and the others?

30:20.833 --> 30:22.625
Late. As always.

30:24.541 --> 30:27.875
-The thing with Bartosz...
-It's okay. You don't need to explain.

30:29.458 --> 30:30.875
But I want to.

30:33.541 --> 30:36.083
I wrote you a text while you were away.

30:36.166 --> 30:37.666
Not just one.

30:38.458 --> 30:40.250
But I never sent them.

30:41.041 --> 30:43.000
It all sounded wrong somehow.

30:43.541 --> 30:46.000
What happened between us last summer...

30:47.166 --> 30:49.166
-I...
-It's really okay.

30:52.916 --> 30:53.916
Something up?

30:56.375 --> 30:57.916
I think I'm having déjà vu.

30:59.000 --> 31:01.166
The light, the forest.

31:02.125 --> 31:04.500
As if all of this
has already happened before.

31:07.750 --> 31:09.000
A glitch in the matrix.

31:10.416 --> 31:11.500
What?

31:11.583 --> 31:15.083
If the world is a simulation,
déjà vu is a glitch in the matrix.

31:15.708 --> 31:17.791
Or a message from the other side.

31:19.750 --> 31:20.958
I read that somewhere.

31:25.541 --> 31:27.083
I'm glad you're back.

31:31.916 --> 31:34.666
-Hey, what the hell?
-Parents' meeting.

31:35.166 --> 31:37.291
Heide's got a stomach bug.
I'm stuck with him.

31:37.375 --> 31:39.458
Hi, Jonas. Ultimate fist bump?

31:39.541 --> 31:41.291
Take him back now.

31:41.375 --> 31:44.250
-You take him back.
-Relax, guys.

31:44.333 --> 31:46.500
I'm not a baby anymore.

31:48.208 --> 31:49.750
What's the idiot doing here?

31:51.416 --> 31:52.916
Only I can do that, okay?

31:53.500 --> 31:54.875
Ouch!

31:55.625 --> 31:57.250
Well, let's go!

32:08.625 --> 32:10.375
It's going to happen again.

32:11.541 --> 32:13.375
It's going to happen again.

32:15.666 --> 32:17.333
It's going to happen again.

32:20.708 --> 32:23.791
You all know that Erik
has been missing for 14 days now.

32:24.833 --> 32:28.250
At this point,
we have no new findings to report.

32:29.375 --> 32:32.333
We're also considering
that he may have simply run away.

32:33.625 --> 32:38.458
If any of your children
say anything about Erik or know anything,

32:39.416 --> 32:40.833
please inform us.

32:40.916 --> 32:43.333
-Thank you, Charlotte.
-How long do you want to wait?

32:43.416 --> 32:46.291
I'd like to talk about
how we interact at school.

32:47.500 --> 32:50.041
And about which measures
we can take to boost security.

32:50.125 --> 32:52.041
What kind of measures?

32:52.125 --> 32:55.041
You heard her say it's not clear
that anything even happened.

32:56.250 --> 32:59.333
But we can't rule anything out,
including that Erik didn't run away.

32:59.416 --> 33:01.083
WILL BE OUTSIDE IN 5 MINUTES

33:01.166 --> 33:02.916
This alarmist talk is absurd.

33:03.041 --> 33:05.500
Charlotte, correct me if I'm wrong,
but in the region,

33:05.583 --> 33:08.166
Winden has the lowest crime rate.

33:08.250 --> 33:10.583
There are no murderers
running around here.

33:10.666 --> 33:14.375
-Statistics only give...
-But we can't just sit and do nothing.

33:14.458 --> 33:17.666
And just wait around until Erik
is found dead somewhere.

33:25.208 --> 33:27.583
What do you guys think happened to Erik?

33:27.666 --> 33:30.750
Kids in our class
are saying someone kidnapped him,

33:30.833 --> 33:33.250
and has him locked up in a basement.

33:33.333 --> 33:35.208
Oh, shut up. He just ran away.

33:35.666 --> 33:40.041
But it could be that he's locked up
somewhere and can't get out.

33:40.666 --> 33:43.833
Why would someone do that?
Lock someone else up?

33:43.916 --> 33:46.208
It's like the witch in Hansel and Gretel.

33:46.291 --> 33:48.500
When she gets hungry,
she has something to eat.

33:49.833 --> 33:53.750
No. Even if Mom and Dad tell you
that most people are nice,

33:53.833 --> 33:56.666
there are people out there
who are anything but nice.

33:56.750 --> 33:59.000
-Like your sister.
-You idiot.

33:59.083 --> 34:01.833
My father said good and evil
are a question of perspective.

34:04.791 --> 34:06.375
Dead father, bad topic?

34:08.291 --> 34:10.291
And if Erik is no longer alive?

34:10.375 --> 34:12.791
If he's lying dead somewhere
and no one finds him?

34:13.333 --> 34:15.041
That would be the worst.

34:15.125 --> 34:17.541
Even if you're dead, you want to be found.

34:17.625 --> 34:20.416
No one is dead,
and no one won't be found, okay?

34:21.583 --> 34:23.541
Can we please change the topic now?

34:24.208 --> 34:26.875
The most important thing is
that we stick together.

34:26.958 --> 34:28.541
That we pull together.

34:28.625 --> 34:31.541
The most important thing
is not to blow this out of proportion,

34:31.625 --> 34:33.958
or we'll have the press
in town in a few days.

34:34.041 --> 34:37.083
We know that doesn't quite fit in
with your plans, Regina.

34:37.166 --> 34:39.583
If you mean my hotel,
this isn't about that at all.

34:39.666 --> 34:42.666
-No? What is it about then?
-It's about our town.

34:43.875 --> 34:46.750
Wrong. This is about a missing child.

34:46.833 --> 34:49.916
Who probably just ran away.
You just heard it yourself.

34:50.041 --> 34:52.791
Maybe you should just worry
about your own problems.

34:55.291 --> 34:57.500
I have no idea what you're talking about.

35:06.166 --> 35:07.583
It's going to happen again.

35:08.625 --> 35:09.958
Helge!

35:10.041 --> 35:12.708
-What are you doing here?
-Is it already too late?

35:14.083 --> 35:14.916
Helge.

35:15.625 --> 35:16.750
It's me, Charlotte.

35:17.416 --> 35:19.166
I'll take you back now, okay?

35:24.000 --> 35:25.833
It's going to happen again!

35:40.583 --> 35:42.250
I'm bored.

35:42.375 --> 35:45.541
-Can we please go home now?
-Nonsense, we're nearly there.

35:54.166 --> 35:55.166
Jonas!

35:57.291 --> 35:58.125
Come on!

36:01.000 --> 36:02.000
ATTENTION!

37:28.250 --> 37:29.791
Over there.

37:29.875 --> 37:31.458
In the armchair.

37:46.500 --> 37:48.583
-And?
-Fuck, dude.

37:49.208 --> 37:50.791
-It was here!
-Looking for this?

37:53.166 --> 37:55.791
-What's she doing here?
-That's mine.

37:56.916 --> 37:58.750
The definition of ownership says

37:58.833 --> 38:02.208
that possession is nine-tenths of the law,
so it's mine for now.

38:02.791 --> 38:05.458
But I'm selling.
What'll you give me for it?

38:05.541 --> 38:06.541
A kick in the ass.

38:08.500 --> 38:10.500
What's in here is easily worth 500.

38:10.583 --> 38:13.625
It's yours for 200.
Daddy's got plenty of money.

38:13.708 --> 38:15.500
Stop the bullshit.

38:15.583 --> 38:17.000
Just give it to me.

38:20.041 --> 38:21.458
Jackpot!

38:26.375 --> 38:27.416
What's that?

38:31.291 --> 38:32.458
Someone's there.

38:32.541 --> 38:34.000
Oh, shit!

38:35.583 --> 38:37.416
Holy shit!

38:41.625 --> 38:42.625
Shit.

38:43.208 --> 38:44.958
-Damn flashlight!
-What is this?

38:45.666 --> 38:47.250
What's that?

38:47.333 --> 38:48.625
-Run!
-Move!

38:48.708 --> 38:50.375
-Run!
-Go!

38:51.375 --> 38:52.583
Come on.

39:16.333 --> 39:17.416
Mikkel?

39:18.500 --> 39:19.541
Mikkel!

39:28.208 --> 39:29.416
Jonas.

40:15.541 --> 40:17.666
What the fuck, man! What was that?

40:17.750 --> 40:19.625
No idea. Shit!

40:20.125 --> 40:21.916
Man, what was that?

40:22.041 --> 40:23.791
Where are Jonas and Mikkel?

40:30.625 --> 40:32.208
Where is Mikkel?

40:33.875 --> 40:35.458
Where is Mikkel?

40:36.041 --> 40:37.791
Why isn't he with you?

40:37.875 --> 40:39.416
He was with you!

40:40.833 --> 40:42.750
Shit! Mikkel!

40:44.000 --> 40:45.250
Mikkel!

41:02.916 --> 41:04.541
Too late.

41:04.625 --> 41:06.208
We're too late.

42:36.125 --> 42:37.125
Mikkel!

42:38.458 --> 42:39.500
Mikkel!

42:45.208 --> 42:46.291
Mikkel!

42:49.208 --> 42:50.291
Mikkel!

42:53.208 --> 42:54.625
Mikkel!

42:58.875 --> 43:00.041
Mikkel?

43:01.791 --> 43:02.875
Mikkel!

43:05.750 --> 43:06.833
Mikkel!

44:14.875 --> 44:16.458
Do you have anything?

44:17.875 --> 44:18.916
Okay.

44:22.875 --> 44:23.708
Yes?

44:25.041 --> 44:27.291
-Have you found him?
-Nothing.

44:28.291 --> 44:29.916
No trace of Mikkel.

44:32.875 --> 44:35.416
-How's Franziska?
-Sleeping.

44:36.666 --> 44:38.041
Charlotte, I...

44:40.625 --> 44:41.916
Can we...

44:43.291 --> 44:45.125
I have to tell you...

44:46.625 --> 44:47.541
Charlotte?

44:47.625 --> 44:48.833
I have to go.

44:49.375 --> 44:50.458
Okay.

44:51.250 --> 44:52.333
Okay.

45:00.541 --> 45:04.166
God grant me the serenity to accept
the things I cannot change,

45:04.250 --> 45:08.291
the courage to change the things I can,
and the wisdom to know the difference.

45:09.208 --> 45:12.000
God grant me the serenity to accept
the things I cannot change,

45:12.083 --> 45:16.041
the courage to change the things I can,
and the wisdom to know the difference.

45:30.708 --> 45:33.291
Calling all units.
At the forest edge at Neuweiher,

45:33.375 --> 45:37.375
elevation F026, two-mile marker,
a child's body has been found.

45:37.458 --> 45:40.125
I repeat, a child's body has been found.

46:19.958 --> 46:21.041
I'm sorry.

47:26.041 --> 47:27.166
That's not Mikkel.

47:32.416 --> 47:33.500
That's not Mikkel.

47:42.583 --> 47:47.958
We fall through the time stream
Then awaken from a dream

47:52.125 --> 47:56.541
But a brief blink of an eye
And then returns the night

48:01.625 --> 48:06.166
Somehow the future starts somewhere
Sometime

48:06.250 --> 48:08.583
I won't wait for long

48:10.708 --> 48:14.208
Love is created through bravery
So don't think about it twice

48:14.291 --> 48:18.916
We ride on fiery wheels
Towards the future through the night

51:05.541 --> 51:09.541
