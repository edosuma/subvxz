before the storm.

03:44.641 --> 03:46.226
-Yeah.
-Big news!

03:49.145 --> 03:50.355
Hello, storm.

03:51.397 --> 03:54.275
CJ and I have something
very important to--

03:54.359 --> 03:55.235
Ooh, pancakes.

03:57.779 --> 04:00.198
Steve and I have set a date.

04:00.281 --> 04:03.701
We are getting married
at the end of the summer...

04:04.327 --> 04:06.037
in Japan.

04:06.829 --> 04:07.872
[both] Huh?

04:08.498 --> 04:09.540
[all] Huh?

04:11.167 --> 04:14.295
We're going to Japan
because that's where my stepfather lives.

04:14.671 --> 04:16.589
And he's paying for the whole thing.

04:17.257 --> 04:18.675
[all] Ah.

04:20.134 --> 04:21.636
We really want you guys to come.

04:21.719 --> 04:24.305
I mean, I know Japan
is a tad inconvenient,

04:24.389 --> 04:27.684
but really it's just a hop, skip
and a 6,000-mile jump.

04:30.019 --> 04:34.023
You do know that there's a really nice
Benihana right around the corner.

04:35.400 --> 04:38.278
What she's trying to say is,
we'll be there.

04:38.361 --> 04:40.738
Great. All right!
Oh, honey, we got to get going.

04:40.822 --> 04:42.573
We have to sign up
for our gift registries.

04:42.657 --> 04:44.867
Ah, Crate and Barrel, Pottery Barn...

04:44.951 --> 04:45.910
And Applebee's!

04:48.371 --> 04:49.872
I love their potato skins.

04:49.956 --> 04:53.042
You know... honey,
we're gonna go to that one first.

04:56.087 --> 04:56.963
Wow.

04:57.046 --> 04:59.173
Steve is really getting married.

04:59.966 --> 05:01.342
And not to you.

05:01.426 --> 05:04.595
Which is fine, if you happen
to hate fairy tales and happy endings.

05:05.888 --> 05:08.057
Would you just admit defeat, Team Steve?

05:08.141 --> 05:11.602
All right, she has found her perfect match
in dreamy Dr. Matt.

05:12.186 --> 05:13.479
He is pretty dreamy.

05:14.814 --> 05:16.858
In fact,
I had a dream about him last night.

05:17.483 --> 05:19.360
[Kimmy and Stephanie] Ooh!

05:19.861 --> 05:23.072
We were folding laundry,
if you know what I mean.

05:24.907 --> 05:25.908
Tell me more.

05:26.701 --> 05:29.954
What? There's nothing more to tell.
We were literally folding laundry.

05:32.415 --> 05:33.833
Hey, Steph-o-Noodle.

05:33.916 --> 05:35.001
[Stephanie] Hi.

05:39.088 --> 05:43.134
I just came by to let you know that
my RV will be parked at Costco today,

05:43.217 --> 05:47.805
because somebody decided to make the city
post those "No Overnight Parking" signs.

05:50.600 --> 05:51.809
Why are you looking at me?

05:52.602 --> 05:54.145
It is an eyesore.

05:54.228 --> 05:56.064
You're always blocking my driveway.

05:56.147 --> 05:58.441
I can never find a place to park.
OK, it was me.

06:05.198 --> 06:06.240
Morning, Deej.

06:06.324 --> 06:09.619
I thought we could carpool into work,
we don't spend enough time together.

06:09.702 --> 06:12.955
Oh, I know. We have to fix that.

06:13.039 --> 06:14.499
What are you talking about?

06:14.582 --> 06:16.584
You guys work together eight hours a day.

06:18.586 --> 06:19.796
But we hardly see each other.

06:19.879 --> 06:22.090
She does dogs and cats,
I do birds and bunnies.

06:23.674 --> 06:27.428
I can't carpool today. I have to tell
Jackson I'm sending him to summer school.

06:27.512 --> 06:29.388
Ouch, summer school's the worst.

06:29.472 --> 06:33.101
That's why I made him a special lunch.
A steak sandwich.

06:33.184 --> 06:34.060
[Matt] Ooh.

06:34.143 --> 06:36.187
An entire pumpkin pie.

06:37.355 --> 06:39.732
And a $50 iTunes gift card.

06:42.276 --> 06:45.696
Deej, you could put Selena Gomez
in that bag, and it ain't gonna help.

06:48.324 --> 06:49.784
Well, I gotta go.

06:49.867 --> 06:52.495
But I hate saying goodbye to you.

06:52.578 --> 06:53.704
Oh, me too.

06:56.165 --> 06:57.291
I'm really gonna miss you.

06:57.959 --> 06:59.836
I'm really gonna miss you, too.

07:01.254 --> 07:03.297
-See you in ten minutes?
-Fifteen if there's traffic.

07:06.843 --> 07:10.388
You know, Deej, you and Matt
really got to find some time to connect.

07:10.972 --> 07:13.808
-Jimmy and I connect every day.
-Oh, yeah, we do.

07:15.059 --> 07:17.937
Ew! Which is another reason
why I want that RV moved.

07:22.984 --> 07:26.779
Hey, don't worry about Matt and me.
I'm gonna fix this.

07:26.863 --> 07:28.489
Oh, yeah, you will.

07:28.573 --> 07:31.033
-No. She doesn't like that.
-Don't do that? OK.

07:32.618 --> 07:33.911
Hola, amigos.

07:37.373 --> 07:38.541
And now, adiós.

07:40.001 --> 07:42.295
Wait. Where are you sneaking off to?

07:42.378 --> 07:43.254
Nowhere.

07:47.842 --> 07:49.135
Did I just get the cheek?

07:50.636 --> 07:52.054
Mi amor.

07:52.138 --> 07:53.681
Don't "mi amor" me

07:53.764 --> 07:56.267
until you tell me "amor"
about what you're up to.

07:58.394 --> 07:59.353
I'm up to nothing.

08:00.146 --> 08:01.314
And now I must go.

08:01.397 --> 08:04.317
Nowhere. With no one. For no reason.

08:05.860 --> 08:07.528
I'm going to be late.

08:08.946 --> 08:09.864
For nothing.

08:12.408 --> 08:15.119
[chanting loudly] No school! No school!

08:15.203 --> 08:17.246
-[Jackson] Yeah, no school.
-[chanting] No school!

08:17.872 --> 08:19.040
This is gonna be the...

08:19.123 --> 08:22.627
♪ Best summer ever ♪

08:24.712 --> 08:27.673
I don't know why,
but I can't get that song out of my head.

08:29.717 --> 08:31.636
-Bye, Mom.
-Oh, honey, wait.

08:32.637 --> 08:35.056
-Where you going?
-With Popko to Mighty Mountain.

08:35.139 --> 08:37.475
Oh, I love that tidal wave ride.

08:37.558 --> 08:38.434
Wait for me.

08:38.518 --> 08:40.978
I'll go get our matching ponchos,
and a spare bra.

08:43.648 --> 08:46.067
Nothing is worse than a soggy brassiere.

08:47.318 --> 08:51.822
Mom, you know I love you,
but you're kind of a third wheel.

08:51.906 --> 08:54.158
I just wanna hang out with my baby.

08:54.742 --> 08:56.953
Tell you what,
if you give me your credit card,

08:57.036 --> 08:59.872
it'll be like a little piece of you
is with me everywhere I go.

09:01.791 --> 09:03.543
That is so sweet.

09:07.505 --> 09:10.508
If you need me, I'll be on the couch
for the next three months.

09:12.134 --> 09:15.221
Yeah. About that. Hold up.

09:16.264 --> 09:18.432
Just call me Chillaxin' Jackson.

09:21.310 --> 09:24.522
You and I need to talk,
and it's a little bit awkward.

09:25.106 --> 09:27.358
Mom, I know where babies come from.

09:30.444 --> 09:32.947
It's about what happened last school year.

09:33.030 --> 09:34.824
About how I crushed it?

09:37.201 --> 09:38.077
Did you?

09:39.328 --> 09:42.373
Because a D-minus in History
is not exactly crushing it.

09:43.874 --> 09:47.795
Which is why I've decided you're gonna
pull up that bad grade in summer school.

09:48.421 --> 09:49.380
Summer school?

09:49.964 --> 09:53.467
Mom, you can't be serious. I'm gonna
be hanging out with Lola all summer.

09:53.801 --> 09:55.636
I don't even know how to process this.

09:57.972 --> 10:01.267
Luckily you don't have to,
because school starts today.

10:02.810 --> 10:05.146
Here are your books, and a special lunch.

10:05.229 --> 10:08.149
Don't forget to look under the pie
for a please-don't-hate-me gift card.

10:10.318 --> 10:12.361
What? So, like, don't even argue?

10:12.445 --> 10:13.487
Just go?

10:13.904 --> 10:15.448
Mom, you can't do this to me.

10:15.531 --> 10:16.866
I'm Chillaxin' Jackson.

10:19.160 --> 10:21.537
Now you're History Passin' Jackson.

10:29.754 --> 10:31.297
You know, it's just hitting me.

10:31.380 --> 10:35.051
This summer is my last chance to be with
Ramona before she's in high school,

10:35.134 --> 10:36.135
and gone forever.

10:36.218 --> 10:38.763
And this summer
is my last chance to help Jackson

10:38.846 --> 10:41.766
before he becomes an unemployed moocher
who lives on my couch forever.

10:44.852 --> 10:46.228
I hear you talking about me.

10:53.944 --> 10:56.906
-Are you here for summer school?
-No, I'm an undercover narc.

10:58.491 --> 10:59.950
Should you be telling me that?

11:01.202 --> 11:02.787
Dude, I'm not a narc.

11:03.496 --> 11:05.581
Ah, got it. You're not a narc.

11:08.626 --> 11:10.544
I can see why you're in summer school.

11:12.004 --> 11:13.756
I'm Roxanne, but they call me Rocki.

11:13.839 --> 11:17.093
-What's your name?
-I'm Jackson. The ladies call me J-Money.

11:18.719 --> 11:20.930
-No, they don't.
-You're right, they don't.

11:21.013 --> 11:22.515
[bell rings]

11:22.598 --> 11:26.268
Little tip, kid. Don't make eye contact
with the weird guy with the beard.

11:26.352 --> 11:27.853
He could snap at any moment.

11:28.979 --> 11:30.314
We're starting.

11:33.067 --> 11:34.735
Whoa. That's our teacher?

11:34.819 --> 11:37.780
I saw him in the parking lot,
sobbing in a Smart car.

11:39.407 --> 11:41.492
[voice wavering] I said, we're starting.

11:48.916 --> 11:51.710
Man, I love living
in the Costco parking lot.

11:52.628 --> 11:54.213
They got all these free samples.

11:54.296 --> 11:57.091
These Swedish meatballs are so good,
I almost bought some.

11:57.174 --> 11:59.885
But then I thought, "Why? They're free."

12:00.511 --> 12:03.889
You know, Morris, it is so nice of you
to let Jimmy keep his RV here.

12:04.306 --> 12:05.599
So, here's the thing.

12:05.683 --> 12:07.810
I like you guys,
but Costco wants you off the property

12:07.893 --> 12:09.979
unless you're actually
gonna buy something.

12:11.021 --> 12:13.858
Well, then tell Costco
to stop giving away free stuff.

12:16.652 --> 12:18.195
Uh, I-- I gotta go.

12:18.279 --> 12:20.906
I just realized I left my Taser
in the handicap bathroom again.

12:22.074 --> 12:25.161
I know I shouldn't be in there,
but it is way cleaner.

12:31.709 --> 12:33.919
[Stephanie] Oh, boy!
Jimmy, you need to see this.

12:34.420 --> 12:39.133
Isn't that Fernando hugging on
a hot blonde with two grande lattes?

12:39.884 --> 12:40.968
Are you sure?

12:41.051 --> 12:43.596
Well, they could be ventis,
they're really big.

12:45.848 --> 12:48.434
The point is,
I think Fernando is cheating on Kimmy.

12:48.517 --> 12:49.685
[Jimmy sighs]

12:51.061 --> 12:52.980
Like, this is gonna break her heart.

12:53.772 --> 12:55.191
Try and let her down easy.

12:56.567 --> 12:57.610
Me?

12:57.693 --> 12:59.361
You're her brother, you tell her.

Why would you draw on my son's face?

He fell asleep in class
and started snoring like a cat.

Brand you? Why would I do that?

I'm sorry you're upset,

I know Fernando's been acting weird,

In fact, all this man can talk about
is how much he loves you.

Allow me.

in my face.

Made the same mistake.
The key is to use a straw.

Get this, it's the old Gibbler house.

22:37.064 --> 22:40.233
Seriously? You bought us
[in Spanish accent] the Gibbler house?

22:41.693 --> 22:44.154
Yes. The Gibbler house.

22:45.363 --> 22:47.991
I can't believe you bought
[in Spanish accent] the Gibbler house.

my last name wrong all these years?

23:12.224 --> 23:14.101
On the one hand, I don't like you.

23:17.104 --> 23:19.481
On the other hand, I need you.

buying us a home is a beautiful gesture.

23:34.287 --> 23:35.831
So, you're moving in?

23:36.456 --> 23:39.501
But I also have to say
I'm very angry I wasn't consulted.

23:39.584 --> 23:40.794
So, you're not moving in?

23:41.878 --> 23:43.880
But I appreciate
you trying to make me happy.

23:43.964 --> 23:45.132
So, you are moving in?

23:46.258 --> 23:48.009
But this does not make me happy.

23:48.093 --> 23:49.302
So, you're not moving in?

23:50.971 --> 23:54.057
You just do whatever you want
and expect me to go along with it.

23:54.141 --> 23:56.768
But I'm only thinking of you
when I tell you what to do.

23:58.478 --> 24:00.438
Because I have the best ideas.

with that whole "bow-chicka-bow-wow"?

into a work day.

is always competing with work,

25:04.961 --> 25:06.504
Well, I guess that's it.

25:06.588 --> 25:08.673
Sweetheart, come here. Sit down with me.

25:11.718 --> 25:13.762
What is it you're worried about, Deej?

25:13.845 --> 25:15.388
I mean, we're a great couple.

25:15.472 --> 25:19.267
I just want us to keep growing closer
so we can build something special.

25:19.351 --> 25:22.437
And I feel like we are.
I couldn't be happier about us.

25:23.772 --> 25:25.315
DJ, I love you.

25:26.107 --> 25:26.983
Whoa.

25:28.902 --> 25:33.281
Did you just say "I love you"?
You've never said that before.

25:34.115 --> 25:36.493
I've been thinking it for a while.

25:37.160 --> 25:38.286
So have I.

25:38.870 --> 25:40.747
Oh, well...

25:41.957 --> 25:43.959
You haven't actually said it yet.

25:45.210 --> 25:46.753
OK, here I go.

25:47.629 --> 25:48.922
I love you.

25:49.005 --> 25:50.423
I love you, too.

25:59.474 --> 26:02.227
Oh, Mylanta! We're in love.
