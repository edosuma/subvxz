00:45.545 --> 00:47.261
Boy!

01:17.577 --> 01:19.394
Boy!

02:22.375 --> 02:23.889
Oh, fuck.

02:31.651 --> 02:33.567
Hey!

02:37.524 --> 02:39.327
Hey!

02:39.877 --> 02:41.948
Who did this?

02:45.031 --> 02:47.414
Come out, you hear?

03:55.335 --> 03:57.685
Oh, my God!

04:19.024 --> 04:20.805
Hey.

04:21.695 --> 04:23.448
Is Lyla here?

04:23.548 --> 04:25.668
Lyla?

04:25.768 --> 04:28.836
Yeah, yeah, she's here.

04:28.936 --> 04:31.105
- Do you live here, too?
- No.

04:31.405 --> 04:34.333
- Are you her boyfriend?
- I'm just a friend.

04:34.433 --> 04:36.844
Okay. Hey... who are you?

04:36.944 --> 04:40.247
Can I come in? Look, I'm her brother.

04:41.247 --> 04:45.420
- Yeah, man. Come on in.
- Yeah? Yeah? Okay.

05:15.281 --> 05:16.831
Hey, wait a minute.

05:25.825 --> 05:27.641
Lyla?

05:33.599 --> 05:35.102
Lyla.

05:35.202 --> 05:38.247
What the fu... what the fuck!
Get the fuck out!

05:38.347 --> 05:41.091
Get the fuck out! Shut the fucking door!
Shut the fucking door!

05:41.191 --> 05:43.908
Get out! Get out! Get out!

05:49.949 --> 05:52.553
- Morning.
- Why are you here?

05:52.653 --> 05:54.221
Look... I need...

05:54.321 --> 05:56.323
You can't just barge
into my place like that.

05:56.423 --> 05:58.425
- I needed to talk to you.
- You should've called.

05:58.525 --> 06:01.395
- I know, but I didn't have a choice.
- You can't just walk into someone's place.

06:01.495 --> 06:02.896
- It is serious, okay?
- I'm serious.

06:02.996 --> 06:05.712
Would you just give me three minutes?

06:08.201 --> 06:10.451
What's the matter?

06:11.338 --> 06:13.841
Do you have any coffee?

06:13.941 --> 06:17.025
- Yeah.
- Can I have some?

06:31.457 --> 06:33.269
Thanks.

06:33.694 --> 06:37.211
- You want any cream?
- Do you have any skim milk?

06:38.398 --> 06:39.618
No.

06:41.534 --> 06:43.622
Cream's fine.

07:07.860 --> 07:10.268
- You want some?
- It's 9:30 in the morning.

07:10.368 --> 07:12.446
So what?

07:22.175 --> 07:25.959
Mona... wanted me to tell you
happy birthday.

07:26.979 --> 07:28.782
Thanks.

07:29.032 --> 07:31.312
She would've told you personally
but with Peggy and Bobby,

07:31.412 --> 07:33.774
she's got her hands full.

07:35.254 --> 07:37.458
How are they?

07:37.558 --> 07:40.409
Good. They're good.

07:40.509 --> 07:44.547
Bobby's starting school... first grade.

07:46.634 --> 07:48.636
You should...
you should come and see them.

07:49.236 --> 07:51.017
Yeah.

07:54.272 --> 07:58.091
So... was that your boyfriend?

07:59.346 --> 08:01.194
Nope.

08:02.715 --> 08:06.237
- Oh, Jesus, Ed. Don't be so puritanical.
- I didn't say anything.

08:06.337 --> 08:09.044
Are you gonna go find him and beat him up
like you did to Charlie Meadows

08:09.144 --> 08:10.592
- in the 7th grade?
- I didn't say anything.

08:10.692 --> 08:13.560
I sincerely doubt that you drove
all this way to try to parent me.

08:13.660 --> 08:16.683
- Look, I'm not and I didn't.
- Okay, 'cause I'm doing just fine.

08:16.783 --> 08:18.432
- Yeah, I can see that.
- Can you?

08:18.532 --> 08:21.034
- It is crystal clear.
- Okay, what do you want?

08:21.134 --> 08:23.317
It's about Martin.

08:27.239 --> 08:31.178
- What about him? Is he all right?
- I think we need to go get him.

08:31.278 --> 08:33.746
Go get him? What do you mean, where is he?

08:33.947 --> 08:35.849
He's at the lake house.

08:36.849 --> 08:39.332
Isn't that... I mean,
that's where he's supposed to be, right?

08:40.453 --> 08:44.656
Lyla, something is very, very wrong.

08:46.226 --> 08:47.828
What?

08:47.928 --> 08:50.497
- Have you talked to Martin?
- I don't think he has my new number.

08:50.597 --> 08:54.468
He called me. He left me a message
and it sounded bad, it sounded off.

08:54.568 --> 08:56.837
- Call his doctor or something, the clinic.
- No, no, no.

08:56.937 --> 08:59.640
This is something that you and I
need to take care of first.

08:59.740 --> 09:01.909
- Why?
- Because he trusts us.

09:02.009 --> 09:03.911
And he won't be so explosive
if you're there.

09:04.011 --> 09:05.379
Oh, fuck.

09:05.479 --> 09:08.182
Look, Lyla, this is not something
that we can turn a blind eye

09:08.282 --> 09:11.752
while some idiot throws him down
a V.A. clinic shock corridor.

09:11.852 --> 09:15.022
- Okay? It will kill him this time.
- I thought he was better.

09:15.122 --> 09:17.771
- So did I, but he's not. He's sicker.
- Sicker how?

09:17.871 --> 09:22.062
I don't know, he just is.
Will you please just come with me?

09:22.162 --> 09:24.598
Listen, I don't want
to ask you to do this.

09:24.698 --> 09:28.235
Maybe... maybe I'm overreacting, okay?
But maybe I am not.

09:28.335 --> 09:30.974
And I am not up for burying
both my parents and my brother

09:31.074 --> 09:36.090
in the same side of this decade.
So will you please come with me?

09:38.711 --> 09:41.663
- Okay.
- Okay.

09:44.884 --> 09:46.787
Okay.

09:46.887 --> 09:48.989
Get dressed.

09:49.589 --> 09:51.638
Bring a coat.

10:09.308 --> 10:12.613
<i>Hello. No one is available
to take your call.</i>

10:12.713 --> 10:15.757
<i>Please leave a message after the tone.</i>

10:18.151 --> 10:21.522
<i>Eddie, it's me, it's Martin.
I need you to listen to me, okay?</i>

10:21.622 --> 10:23.657
<i>I can't say much, but I don't need to.</i>

10:23.857 --> 10:26.193
<i>If anything happens to me...</i>

10:26.693 --> 10:29.876
<i>I just need you to know this,
I just need you...</i>

10:30.830 --> 10:34.700
<i>That I finally cracked it.
I was right all along!</i>

10:35.536 --> 10:39.271
<i>No matter who tells you what,
do not believe anything they say.</i>

10:39.371 --> 10:41.942
<i>I've uncovered the truth!</i>

10:42.042 --> 10:45.408
<i>That'll bring some pretty
serious consequences.</i>

10:45.708 --> 10:48.915
<i>I guess what I'm trying to say
is I love you, Ed.</i>

10:49.596 --> 10:51.838
<i>They're probably gonna say some...</i>

10:51.938 --> 10:55.154
<i>pretty terrible things
about me when it's over.</i>

10:55.956 --> 10:57.805
<i>It's...</i>

11:00.360 --> 11:03.276
<i>No! No...</i>

11:19.278 --> 11:21.754
Morning, Star Shine.

11:22.916 --> 11:25.418
How are you still awake?

11:25.518 --> 11:27.557
If I dozed off, we'd both be dead.

11:27.657 --> 11:29.702
Har, har.

11:32.190 --> 11:35.657
- Do you wanna stop somewhere and rest?
- No.

11:36.257 --> 11:38.599
I wanna plow through. If we don't stop,
we'll be there before morning.

11:38.699 --> 11:42.636
- Can you at least turn the heat on?
- No, it'll make me drowsy.

11:42.736 --> 11:44.952
You're crazy.

11:51.310 --> 11:53.915
- Jesus, Lyla.
- What?

11:54.815 --> 11:58.619
- You serious with that?
- It's fucking cold, Ed.

11:58.719 --> 12:01.054
Do you always carry a flask on you,
or is that something new?

12:01.154 --> 12:04.575
- Only to bullshit situations like this one.
- You know it's a myth, right?

12:04.675 --> 12:07.700
Alcohol doesn't actually warm you.
It lowers your body temperature.

12:07.800 --> 12:10.230
Ladies and gentlemen,
this has been your fact of the day.

12:10.330 --> 12:12.539
- Well, I hope you know what you're doing.
- I do.

12:12.639 --> 12:14.447
Okay.

12:29.732 --> 12:32.116
Ed, I'm sure he's fine.

12:34.453 --> 12:36.523
We just need to get up there.

12:37.023 --> 12:39.326
He might not wanna come with us.

12:39.426 --> 12:41.528
I'm aware.

12:41.628 --> 12:43.435
Then what?

12:44.930 --> 12:47.400
I don't know.
I haven't thought of that yet.

12:47.500 --> 12:50.467
Look, I just know when we get there
you don't talk about doctors, or clinics,

12:50.567 --> 12:52.123
or anything like that. Do you understand?

12:52.223 --> 12:54.808
- Why?
- Because just don't!

12:54.908 --> 12:59.479
Look, I just... I need you
on my side this time, okay?

12:59.579 --> 13:02.015
- I'm here, aren't I?
- Look, even when we get up there.

13:02.115 --> 13:05.632
I am. Don't be so paranoid.

13:08.061 --> 13:09.796
Don't touch it.

13:28.507 --> 13:30.591
I got you those.

13:30.977 --> 13:33.647
This is how you're gonna
keep me on your side?

13:33.747 --> 13:37.721
- I just know you like them, is all.
- Yeah, when I was six.

13:38.619 --> 13:41.388
- I'll take them back then.
- I didn't say that I don't still.

13:41.488 --> 13:45.472
- You gonna be on my side?
- I already told you I was.

13:53.199 --> 13:55.515
I'm gonna need your flask.

13:58.103 --> 13:59.439
What?

13:59.539 --> 14:02.075
Look, I don't know what to expect
when we get there.

14:02.175 --> 14:04.778
- I can't have you out of control.
- I'm not out of control.

14:04.878 --> 14:07.614
I don't want it to be an issue, okay?

14:07.714 --> 14:10.417
- This is about Martin.
- No!

14:10.817 --> 14:14.219
- You'll get it back when it's over, okay?
- Stop parenting me.

14:14.319 --> 14:18.358
Look, I'm not parenting you but I need you
to start acting like an adult.

14:18.458 --> 14:21.041
Okay? Just for this.

14:22.595 --> 14:24.434
Please?

14:30.169 --> 14:32.656
- Thank you.
- Whatever.

14:38.410 --> 14:40.427
You should put your seatbelt on.

16:31.957 --> 16:34.499
How do you know he's still here?

16:35.128 --> 16:37.101
I don't.

17:11.597 --> 17:13.547
Martin?

17:16.734 --> 17:18.752
Marty?

17:21.839 --> 17:24.810
Why do you think he has
all the windows covered?

17:24.911 --> 17:27.292
God only knows.

17:52.204 --> 17:54.154
Marty!

17:58.044 --> 18:00.410
Did you hear that?

18:00.510 --> 18:02.962
Let's try the other door.

18:37.416 --> 18:39.897
You have a key to this place?

18:40.386 --> 18:42.856
What are we doing knocking on the doors
and banging on the windows?

18:42.956 --> 18:45.959
He's a grown man, Lyla.
I don't wanna just barge in on him.

18:46.059 --> 18:47.727
But you can barge into my apartment.

18:47.827 --> 18:50.130
- Your boyfriend let me in.
- He's not my boyfriend!

18:50.230 --> 18:53.949
Okay, Jesus Christ,
I will call next time. All right?

19:03.709 --> 19:05.592
Marty?

19:19.992 --> 19:21.850
Martin?

20:14.529 --> 20:16.279
Ed?

20:58.223 --> 21:00.761
Oh, my God.

21:01.561 --> 21:04.976
If Dad saw this place,
he'd be spinning in his grave.

21:05.864 --> 21:07.714
Jesus.

21:23.415 --> 21:25.217
Ed.

21:26.206 --> 21:28.869
- Ed!
- Hang on.

21:44.970 --> 21:47.808
Get back! Get back!

21:47.908 --> 21:49.909
You can't just be... You shouldn't
be here! Why did you come here?

21:50.009 --> 21:52.295
Were you followed? Why did you come here?

21:52.395 --> 21:53.877
Ed!

22:03.622 --> 22:06.572
Were you followed?

22:07.159 --> 22:08.138
Oh, my...

22:08.238 --> 22:10.889
Fucking answer me.
Were you followed? Answer me!

22:10.989 --> 22:13.246
It's just us!

22:14.599 --> 22:16.783
It's just us, Martin.

22:23.274 --> 22:25.124
Fuck.

22:27.446 --> 22:30.797
Oh, fuck. No, no, no, no, no.

22:52.170 --> 22:56.176
- Why did you come here?
- I got your message.

22:56.576 --> 22:58.661
No, no, no, no, no!

22:58.761 --> 23:01.781
My message told you not to come here!
I told you not to come!

23:01.881 --> 23:03.650
We were worried about you, Martin.

23:03.750 --> 23:08.254
Oh, yeah, yeah, that's very kind of you.
Lyla. Hey. Thanks for your concern.

23:08.354 --> 23:11.257
Especially considering the last time
I saw you, you didn't even have tits yet.

23:11.357 --> 23:14.227
- Marty
- You did the opposite of what I told you!

23:14.327 --> 23:16.729
This goes back to our childhood, I think!

23:16.829 --> 23:19.664
- Marty!
- What, Ed?

23:19.764 --> 23:21.309
What's the gun for?

23:23.201 --> 23:26.872
- Protection.
- Protection from what?

23:26.972 --> 23:30.974
- You don't wanna know.
- You don't need that anymore, all right?

23:31.074 --> 23:33.326
Can I have it?

23:39.851 --> 23:43.456
- Oh, God, I get it now.
- Martin.

23:43.556 --> 23:45.891
Yeah, I get it.

23:46.091 --> 23:49.901
Did anyone ever fucking tell you...
that interventions don't actually work?

23:50.001 --> 23:52.727
They're just vanity pieces, Ed.
Especially surprise ones!

23:52.827 --> 23:55.416
Put the gun down!

23:56.302 --> 23:58.684
Put it down!

24:06.578 --> 24:08.327
Look...

24:10.982 --> 24:13.586
I'm not going back there.
Do you understand me?

24:13.686 --> 24:18.405
- All right, I understand, it's okay.
- God, you guys made a mistake coming here.

24:18.925 --> 24:22.724
- You made a great, big fucking mistake.
- You don't look well.

24:22.824 --> 24:25.231
Thank you so much for your input, Lyla!

24:25.331 --> 24:28.364
- Just calm down!
- Do not tell me to calm down!

24:28.464 --> 24:34.009
- All right, just tell us what is the matter!
- Okay, okay, okay! Here it fucking goes!

24:40.545 --> 24:42.028
I'm on...

24:44.783 --> 24:46.503
I...

24:48.588 --> 24:50.656
I'm on to something.

24:51.756 --> 24:55.328
Okay, okay, that's what you said,
all right? What do you mean?

24:55.428 --> 24:58.465
I mean I found something!
Something in the woods!

24:58.565 --> 25:01.167
Something the likes of which you
cannot even begin to understand.

25:01.267 --> 25:04.261
- What is it?
- It was following me.

25:04.361 --> 25:06.739
It was stalking me.

25:06.939 --> 25:08.941
It killed the dog, man.

25:09.041 --> 25:12.179
- Artie's dead?
- It tore him to shreds!

25:13.079 --> 25:14.680
Is that what's in the back room?

25:14.780 --> 25:18.551
No! Stop! Listen to me! Do not, under any
circumstances, go into that back room!

25:18.651 --> 25:20.620
Answer me! Do you understand? Answer me!

25:20.720 --> 25:22.733
Let her go!

25:22.833 --> 25:25.827
- What is in the back room?
- Goddamn it!

25:26.868 --> 25:28.694
Don't fucking do this to yourself!

25:28.794 --> 25:32.432
Martin, you tell me what's in that
back room right now or I swear to God...

25:32.532 --> 25:36.035
There is nothing in the back room!

25:36.135 --> 25:40.062
Fuck, man! It's in the basement!

25:40.606 --> 25:42.221
What is?

25:44.176 --> 25:47.680
Martin? This is serious
and I'm only gonna ask you this once.

25:47.780 --> 25:50.183
Do you have somebody locked
in that basement?

25:50.283 --> 25:53.553
God, it's not somebody, it's something!

25:53.653 --> 25:56.789
Martin? If you have
somebody lo... Look at me!

25:56.889 --> 25:59.426
If you have somebody locked
in that basement

25:59.526 --> 26:02.529
we are all gonna be in a whole lot
of trouble. Do you understand me?

26:02.629 --> 26:05.398
Do not talk to me
like I'm one of your patients!

26:05.498 --> 26:07.367
- Okay, I'm not!
- Yeah? Yeah?

26:07.467 --> 26:11.070
'Cause you think I'm crazy! You think I've
snapped? You think I've completely lost it.

26:11.170 --> 26:13.473
What are you gonna diagnose me with
this time then?

26:13.573 --> 26:16.587
Lone Man in the Woods Syndrome?
Well, I haven't snapped!

26:16.687 --> 26:20.580
I haven't lost it!
I've finally got the fucking proof!

26:20.680 --> 26:24.517
And there's no way you can send me back to
that fucking clinic. Do you understand me?

26:24.617 --> 26:27.220
Martin, I do not want
to send you back, okay!

26:27.320 --> 26:30.173
Look, nobody does! Listen to me!

26:30.273 --> 26:32.458
Lyla! Lyla, did we...

26:32.558 --> 26:35.944
Did we once say that we wanted
to send him back to the hospital?

26:36.044 --> 26:37.998
Did we?

26:38.598 --> 26:41.193
No, Marty, honest.

26:41.867 --> 26:45.291
See? See?

26:46.138 --> 26:48.174
But you gotta stop rambling, man.

26:48.274 --> 26:52.511
You gotta give me a sense of...
what's going on in your head.

26:52.611 --> 26:57.181
All right? Otherwise, I'm gonna be forced
to start making some phone calls.

26:57.817 --> 27:00.066
Is that clear?

27:01.653 --> 27:03.525
Is that...

27:03.921 --> 27:05.801
Yes.

27:09.060 --> 27:13.253
You sound more and more
like Pop every day.

27:14.933 --> 27:17.436
Is that clear?

27:17.536 --> 27:19.105
Can you get a load of this guy?

27:19.205 --> 27:22.255
He's not the same kid we used to call
Special Ed. Remember that?

27:24.275 --> 27:26.859
What is in the basement?

27:27.879 --> 27:30.856
- Answer me!
- It's a pod!

27:32.250 --> 27:35.462
- A pod.
- Yeah.

27:36.421 --> 27:39.325
- What's a pod?
- Great.

27:39.425 --> 27:43.943
It's a pod. It's a pod! It's...

27:46.531 --> 27:48.801
Do you know what they used us for

27:48.901 --> 27:51.704
during that colossal
goat fuck out in the desert?

27:51.804 --> 27:55.875
It wasn't for combat! It was for tests!

27:56.375 --> 27:59.879
For experimental tests and their effect
on the average soldier.

27:59.979 --> 28:02.382
- Like lab rats?
- Yeah, lab rats.

28:02.482 --> 28:04.450
You're saying you were
experimented on, Marty?

28:04.550 --> 28:07.920
Man, I'm not saying it.
I was experimented on, Ed.

28:08.020 --> 28:10.699
- Who experimented on you?
- Who do you think?

28:10.799 --> 28:14.640
- What kind of experiments?
- Supplements at first. Pills, right?

28:15.760 --> 28:19.899
Pills that would fucking keep you awake
for four days straight, without any crash.

28:19.999 --> 28:22.635
And then, there were the ones
that would suddenly, magically

28:22.735 --> 28:26.139
make you forget where we were
for the last 12-14 hours of our lives!

28:26.239 --> 28:28.508
- Did they hurt you?
- I don't know if they hurt me!

28:28.608 --> 28:32.412
I was blacked out! But I do know...
I do know that guys started getting sick.

28:32.512 --> 28:35.069
Come, man, I knew that much!
I know it! I know it! I saw it!

28:35.169 --> 28:37.846
They would get sick! They'd faint!
And they'd vomit!

28:37.946 --> 28:41.788
And then some guys... Oh, fuck, some guys
would just straight-up disappear!

28:41.888 --> 28:44.640
But, no, no, no, stop, that's not
the point I'm trying to make, okay?

28:44.740 --> 28:46.492
- Marty, what...
- What happened during the blackouts?

28:46.592 --> 28:48.761
Lyla, please! Okay, Marty,
what are you trying to say?

28:48.861 --> 28:52.632
I don't know what happened during the blackouts
which is why they call them blackouts, Ed!

28:52.732 --> 28:55.251
What do you mean, "Lyla, please"?
Jesus, are you hearing this?

28:55.351 --> 28:58.571
- They did tests on him!
- Listen to me!

28:58.671 --> 29:00.853
But there was always this one thing!

29:01.146 --> 29:04.644
I kept hearing guys whispering about it.

29:04.944 --> 29:08.262
You'd hear these guys talking
about this training program

29:08.362 --> 29:10.251
with a new kind of soldier.

29:10.351 --> 29:14.320
You know, I thought it was just guys
trying to scare new recruits into obedience.

29:14.420 --> 29:18.257
But this one time...
Oh, my God, this one time.

29:19.257 --> 29:21.275
I woke up right in the middle of it.

29:22.528 --> 29:23.930
- Where were you?
- Lyla!

29:24.030 --> 29:25.474
- Shut up, Ed.
- I was in a lab,

29:25.574 --> 29:30.148
I was in some sort of
lab tank or something,

29:30.248 --> 29:32.585
and there was this thing.

29:36.041 --> 29:37.675
This thing...

29:37.775 --> 29:42.727
it was just tearing into
one of the bigger guys.

29:42.827 --> 29:45.273
He fucking bunked a couple
of beds next to me

29:45.373 --> 29:48.341
and I saw it just tear him apart!

29:48.441 --> 29:52.024
- What was it?
- It was the new experiment.

29:52.124 --> 29:54.727
Now you're with me.
It was the new experiment, man.

29:54.827 --> 29:56.981
It was the pod!

29:57.081 --> 30:00.390
I saw that thing in the flesh!

30:00.490 --> 30:03.636
The same one that followed me here
or a similar looking one!

30:03.736 --> 30:07.817
I got it, man! I fucking proved it!

30:13.044 --> 30:15.461
Christ almighty.

30:16.781 --> 30:19.686
- What?
- Nothing.

30:19.786 --> 30:21.887
No, no, what? Say it, what?

30:21.987 --> 30:24.925
- Nothing.
- What?

30:26.025 --> 30:28.596
So you were experimented on...

30:29.195 --> 30:32.331
and you came to in some lab,

30:32.431 --> 30:34.267
some Army base lab. Right? Is that right?

30:34.367 --> 30:36.168
- Am I getting it right, so far?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

30:36.268 --> 30:41.507
And when he did,
you saw something, like a pod?

30:41.607 --> 30:43.919
A pod?

30:44.019 --> 30:47.080
- Is that right?
- Look, is that so ridiculous?

30:48.180 --> 30:52.265
Do you seriously want me
to answer that question?

30:53.754 --> 30:55.071
Fuck, man!

30:55.171 --> 30:58.591
Oswald, Whitman, Timothy, fucking McVeigh,
what do they have in common?

30:58.691 --> 31:00.993
Tell me what they had in common?
They were all soldiers.

31:01.093 --> 31:02.680
They were all brainwashed, fall guys,

31:02.780 --> 31:05.331
who took then hit and then
what happened to them?

31:05.431 --> 31:07.700
They got fucking nailed
to the cross for it. Okay?

31:07.800 --> 31:09.402
But now imagine if there is no mess!

31:09.502 --> 31:13.806
Imagine if your nameless, faceless entity
your unidentifiable, untraceable pod

31:13.906 --> 31:17.421
goes into the Alfred P. Murrah Building
in downtown Oklahoma City at 9:02 am

31:17.521 --> 31:20.500
and blows itself up instead!
Right? There is no fall guy.

31:20.600 --> 31:24.066
You don't need a John Doe #2.
There is none! Okay?

31:24.166 --> 31:28.370
This thing is programmed
to do all the vile shit you need!

31:28.470 --> 31:32.158
And if anything gets in its way,
it'll tear it to fucking pieces!

31:32.258 --> 31:34.293
Just like it did
to that big guy in the bunker.

31:34.393 --> 31:36.886
And just like it fucking did to Artie.

31:36.986 --> 31:38.998
Okay.

31:39.098 --> 31:41.901
There is no evidence.
There are no fingers to point.

31:42.001 --> 31:47.274
And that, you son of a bitch,
that is a fucking pod!

31:47.807 --> 31:50.543
So you just found one of these things?

31:50.643 --> 31:53.746
Just roaming around
in the middle of nowhere Maine.

31:53.846 --> 31:56.549
- Yes! Yes! Yes.
- Yeah?

31:56.649 --> 31:59.585
That's what I've been
trying to say all along! Yes.

31:59.685 --> 32:02.521
Who fucking knows how many
could be out there right now.

32:02.621 --> 32:06.325
- Okay, how did it find you then?
- That's a good fucking question, Ed.

32:06.425 --> 32:09.328
Now he's talking fucking business.
Now you're getting to the heart of it.

32:09.428 --> 32:13.432
I'll tell you how they fucking found me,
because of this.

32:13.732 --> 32:15.484
What?

32:17.703 --> 32:20.935
- Did you do that to yourself?
- Fuck yeah.

32:21.273 --> 32:24.265
- How?
- Pair of pliers, big boy.

32:25.995 --> 32:31.250
That's how they were tracking me!
They planted a chip in my fucking gums!

32:31.350 --> 32:34.286
- Where's the tracking device?
- Where's the tracking device?

32:34.386 --> 32:36.569
I smashed into a million goddamn pieces!

32:40.358 --> 32:42.695
Goddamn it! Fucking pussy!

32:42.795 --> 32:44.877
Come on! Do it!

33:38.149 --> 33:41.186
Look. Come see. Come see.
Here, it's right here.

33:41.286 --> 33:43.689
Fuck! Okay, it's here.

33:43.789 --> 33:48.606
No, no, no, wait, wait, wait. Fuck me.
Wait, wait, wait! Okay?

33:48.706 --> 33:51.621
So, here's the pieces of the tooth,

33:51.721 --> 33:54.643
- and here's...
- I don't see anything.

33:54.743 --> 33:57.403
Here's the piece of it!
Look, look, do you see that?

33:57.503 --> 34:01.407
I see something!
It looks like metal, Ed! Look!

34:01.507 --> 34:05.091
I told you! Look...

34:16.020 --> 34:18.225
No! Wait, stop! Where are you going?
You don't believe me?

34:18.324 --> 34:20.750
No, I don't believe you.
This is exactly like the last time.

34:20.850 --> 34:22.862
Take a fucking look around you!

34:22.962 --> 34:26.864
This is classic, paranoid schizophrenic
behavior rearing itself up.

34:26.964 --> 34:30.359
- Have you been taking your pills?
- Okay, don't call me a schizophrenic.

34:30.458 --> 34:33.964
- I am not a schizophrenic!
- Lyla doesn't believe you, either. Do you, Lyla!

34:34.063 --> 34:38.010
Why did you come here? Why don't you just
leave and let me handle this mess by myself?

34:38.110 --> 34:41.246
Because we care about you!
You are not well!

34:41.347 --> 34:44.250
Yeah? Then what the fuck do I have
locked in that basement door?

34:44.350 --> 34:46.851
I don't know, but I'm gonna
find out right fucking now!

34:46.952 --> 34:49.212
Hey! No!

34:49.312 --> 34:52.732
Wait! No! Stop! No, stop.
Don't do this to yourself.

34:52.831 --> 34:55.159
You listen to me good and hard, okay,
'cause here are the facts.

34:55.260 --> 35:00.332
- I have the facts, you don't have anything.
- You had your chance, now you let me speak!

35:01.665 --> 35:03.215
Proceed!

35:08.506 --> 35:12.163
Dr. Menken showed me
the tapes of your sessions.

35:12.978 --> 35:15.514
I know you weren't experimented on, okay?
No, I know that.

35:15.614 --> 35:16.882
Look, you don't know shit!

35:16.982 --> 35:19.318
Martin, you might think you were,
but you weren't! Okay?

35:19.418 --> 35:21.820
This is exactly like the last time!

35:21.920 --> 35:24.256
No, this is nothing like last time!
This is real!

35:24.356 --> 35:27.560
Oh, is it real? Is it real like Edith?

35:28.560 --> 35:32.874
- Edith? Edith?
- Don't you do that. You remember Edith.

35:33.799 --> 35:35.368
No, that's not the same thing.

35:35.468 --> 35:38.202
- Was Edith actually a spy from the Army?
- Stop it! Stop it!

35:38.302 --> 35:41.874
Was she really feeding you
arsenic in those pills?

35:41.974 --> 35:45.211
You know, I saw her at the clinic,
Martin. She was still working there.

35:45.311 --> 35:48.480
Her scars are still pretty bad,
but she asked about you.

35:48.580 --> 35:51.183
Yeah, she was glad to hear
you were still doing okay.

35:51.283 --> 35:54.186
- Shut up!
- The Army isn't out to get you, Martin.

35:54.286 --> 35:58.494
There was no arsenic in those pills.
There is no monster in that basement now.

35:58.594 --> 36:00.993
You think you have all the answers,
but I am begging you.

36:01.093 --> 36:05.364
I am fucking begging you!
Please, man, brother, just go!

36:05.464 --> 36:08.380
Please! Before it's too late!

36:14.038 --> 36:16.985
You are a victim, okay?

36:17.085 --> 36:19.614
Look, you are a victim
of an organization...

36:19.714 --> 36:22.556
Don't do that, Martin! You were
a victim of an organization

36:22.656 --> 36:26.952
that is so hungry for man power
that they will accept anybody.

36:27.052 --> 36:30.556
Now it is a crime, okay?
But it's not your fault!

36:30.656 --> 36:34.927
Look, there are people
who can help you. All right?

36:35.027 --> 36:37.379
Look, Lyla and I can help you!

36:37.479 --> 36:41.216
We won't leave you alone this time, all right.
No, no, we'll get you the help that you need.

36:41.316 --> 36:44.486
- No, okay, okay, okay, now listen to me.
- No, please! Look, Martin!

36:44.586 --> 36:46.755
Please just let me make this right.

36:46.855 --> 36:50.159
No, the other guys in my platoon!
They were dropping like flies! Right?

36:50.259 --> 36:53.662
Every one of them.
One-by-one dead! No trace of them!

36:53.762 --> 36:55.964
Doesn't that seem
even the slightest bit odd to you?

36:56.064 --> 37:00.068
Doesn't it seem like somebody, somewhere
is trying to get rid of any evidence? Right?

37:00.168 --> 37:02.804
So what if they gave us
all a disease? Right?

37:02.904 --> 37:05.218
What if there's a whole bunch
of patience zeroes out there, okay?

37:05.318 --> 37:09.857
And there's not too long before
it takes you to track it back to the source!

37:15.850 --> 37:19.265
Just come with me, please?

37:19.855 --> 37:22.925
Just come on. We'll...
we'll get in the car, all right?

37:23.025 --> 37:26.211
We'll get in the car
and we'll just drive. And...

37:26.311 --> 37:29.528
Ed! That thing will kill me.

37:29.628 --> 37:32.468
It will kill you and it will kill Lyla.

37:32.568 --> 37:36.005
And if it gets out,
who knows what it will do!

37:37.105 --> 37:40.023
There is no monster in the basement.

37:42.842 --> 37:46.394
- There's no pod.
- No? Then how'd this happen?

37:57.358 --> 37:59.427
It's not getting better.

38:01.393 --> 38:05.300
I think it's getting... much, much worse.

38:05.400 --> 38:10.538
That thing down there, it's got something
in it's blood and it's... infected me.

38:10.638 --> 38:14.210
I swear to God, if you let it
scratch you, it'll infect you.

38:14.310 --> 38:17.325
Oh, fuck me, man!

38:18.779 --> 38:21.249
Fuck. Fuck!

38:21.650 --> 38:23.470
Fuck!

38:27.982 --> 38:32.861
Okay. No, no, no. Oh, shit, it's been
fucking with my vision. That's all.

38:32.961 --> 38:36.031
Whatever it is, there's something
poisoned in its blood.

38:36.131 --> 38:39.180
You gotta believe me! Oh, God!

38:40.834 --> 38:41.971
I need to talk to you.

38:42.071 --> 38:44.886
- Do you really think they put something...
- Now!

39:25.212 --> 39:27.016
- What do you think?
- What do I think?

39:27.116 --> 39:29.518
I think this is worse than I thought,
that's what I fucking think.

39:29.618 --> 39:31.620
What if he's telling the truth?

39:31.720 --> 39:34.389
What if what? What if what?

39:34.489 --> 39:38.672
I don't know. I don't know.
He seems pretty convinced.

39:39.161 --> 39:42.330
What about this suggests
that he's telling the truth?

39:42.430 --> 39:46.935
- Did you take a fucking look at this shit?
- I'm just trying to see it from all sides!

39:47.235 --> 39:50.472
This is so goddamn typical.
I told you not to team up on me with this.

39:50.572 --> 39:53.308
- I told you to say on my fucking side!
- I am still on your side!

39:53.408 --> 39:55.711
Then how can you even entertain
the shit he's talking?

39:55.811 --> 39:58.313
Because it's Martin, Ed!

39:58.413 --> 40:01.917
Lyla, sometimes people...
their minds unearth sickness, okay?

40:02.017 --> 40:04.219
He is sick!

40:04.319 --> 40:07.422
All right? He has scratches
all over his fucking body.

40:07.522 --> 40:10.805
They are self-inflicted
and they are very infected.

40:11.826 --> 40:14.129
The longer we let him run around
and keep doing this shit

40:14.229 --> 40:18.667
he's gonna start thinking that we're part of
the grand conspiracy, too. You want that?

40:19.167 --> 40:22.838
But what if... what if he really does have
something trapped in the basement?

40:22.938 --> 40:27.476
- What if he found something in the woods?
- What? What? A fucking pod?

40:27.576 --> 40:29.211
A government assassin?

40:29.311 --> 40:32.927
Jesus Christ, what if he's got
the fucking mailman down there, Lyla?

40:33.782 --> 40:36.351
Look, he's just making stories, okay?

40:36.451 --> 40:39.021
They are fucking... these narratives.

40:39.121 --> 40:42.391
He's connecting roundabout dots. Right?

40:42.491 --> 40:44.660
To ease his guilt about Mom
and Dad's death.

40:44.760 --> 40:49.425
So that he doesn't feel responsibility
for getting kicked out of the fucking army!

40:51.332 --> 40:53.915
He was kicked out of the army?

40:54.936 --> 40:58.725
Yeah. Yeah. It was some
other grandiose story,

40:58.825 --> 41:01.610
some other conspiracy theory.
And he's gonna keep doing it.

41:01.710 --> 41:05.047
He's gonna keep doing it until
we get him some real help. Okay?

41:05.147 --> 41:08.217
But I thought you said that this happens
to soldiers all the time.

41:08.317 --> 41:12.354
Lyla, I lied! Okay? It doesn't.

41:12.454 --> 41:15.891
Look, he got caught trying
to take a tank off the base.

41:15.991 --> 41:17.859
When they arrested him,
they committed him.

41:17.959 --> 41:21.096
And he attacked a nurse
and tried to rip her fucking face off!

41:21.196 --> 41:24.712
That was his time in the army.
That's where he's been.

42:48.315 --> 42:49.965
Oh, fuck.

42:59.026 --> 43:00.475
Here.

43:01.596 --> 43:03.311
Thanks.

43:41.301 --> 43:43.785
Tastes like kerosene.

43:46.507 --> 43:48.443
What are we gonna do?

43:48.543 --> 43:50.845
I'll tell you what we're gonna do.

43:50.945 --> 43:54.483
We're gonna go down there and give him
an ultimatum. That's what we're gonna do.

43:54.583 --> 43:56.551
Doesn't seem like he's gonna take one.

43:56.651 --> 43:59.187
I'm gonna tell him he has
two choices then, okay?

43:59.287 --> 44:01.857
One of them is to get in our car quietly

44:01.957 --> 44:04.192
and go with us to the clinic
to see his doctor.

44:04.292 --> 44:06.127
Dr. Nick?

44:06.427 --> 44:08.696
Dr. Nick.

44:08.796 --> 44:10.832
He's not gonna like that, Ed.

44:11.532 --> 44:14.582
- I'm aware.
- He could do something bad.

44:14.852 --> 44:17.324
Really bad.

44:18.906 --> 44:20.956
That's why I have this.

44:27.014 --> 44:29.451
What the fuck do you think you're doing?

44:29.551 --> 44:33.088
You can't just stick him with a needle
like he's some kind of animal.

44:33.188 --> 44:38.059
All right, okay, look, it is very mild.
It won't even put him out. All right?

44:38.159 --> 44:43.077
This is your whole plan
you hadn't thought of yet?

44:43.797 --> 44:48.637
- He's never gonna let you do it.
- I am not gonna ask him permission. Okay?

44:48.737 --> 44:51.273
- He has a rifle down there, Ed!
- I got it, I know.

44:51.373 --> 44:54.376
We are the ones he trusts
and he almost blew our heads off!

44:54.476 --> 44:57.278
Christ, if he knows you're gonna
stick him with a fucking syringe!

44:57.378 --> 45:00.181
Now look, if he's not going
to come with us willingly

45:00.281 --> 45:03.118
then I need to go and get him
in that car no matter what.

45:03.218 --> 45:05.253
Dr. Nick agrees with me.

45:05.353 --> 45:07.502
Then Dr. Nick can come here
and give him to him.

45:09.857 --> 45:11.392
- Martin...
- Shut the fuck up!

45:11.492 --> 45:14.162
- How long were you out there for?
- What were you two talking about in here?

45:14.262 --> 45:17.873
- Marty, we're just here to help you!
- You and who else?

45:17.973 --> 45:21.870
- You and who else? Who else, who else, who?
- Nobody, Martin!

45:21.970 --> 45:23.739
You told me nobody knew
you were coming here.

45:23.839 --> 45:25.807
- Nobody else does.
- What does Dr. Nick know?

45:25.907 --> 45:27.542
- What? Marty...
- Does Dr. Nick know? Answer me!

45:27.642 --> 45:31.494
Shut up, Lyla! Answer the question!
And do not lie to me, Edward!

45:35.115 --> 45:40.135
Yes, okay? Dr. Nick knows
about this, but...

45:41.889 --> 45:44.593
- You let this get out.
- Look, we can fix this.

45:44.693 --> 45:47.662
You have no idea what you've done.

45:47.762 --> 45:49.611
Marty, wait.

45:50.931 --> 45:53.020
We're all dead anyway.

45:53.634 --> 45:55.583
Fuck.

46:00.708 --> 46:03.357
I need something to cover this!

46:03.978 --> 46:07.392
Lyla! Lyla!

46:15.022 --> 46:17.793
- Call an ambulance!
- We gotta get an ambulance.

46:17.893 --> 46:20.462
Lyla, let go of him and call an ambulance!

46:20.562 --> 46:24.180
Now! Go! Jesus!

46:24.280 --> 46:26.547
Come on, Marty!

46:43.951 --> 46:45.963
Lyla!

47:02.803 --> 47:05.247
No, no, no. Marty, Marty!
Marty, look at me!

47:05.347 --> 47:08.407
Marty! Look at me! Marty!

47:55.889 --> 47:57.968
Where are they?

47:58.501 --> 48:01.863
- Who?
- The ambulance.

48:02.730 --> 48:04.266
I couldn't.

48:04.366 --> 48:07.156
What? You didn't call anyone?

48:07.256 --> 48:09.170
I couldn't.

48:09.270 --> 48:12.988
- Lyla, you didn't call anybody?
- He cut the phone line.

48:15.199 --> 48:18.380
No, we... we gotta get the fuck
out of here. Get up.

48:18.480 --> 48:21.149
- We can't leave him like this.
- Come on, get up! Get up! Lyla, get up!

48:21.249 --> 48:25.754
Stop it! Stop it! You don't fucking care!
You don't fucking care!

48:25.854 --> 48:28.089
- Look at him! Look at him!
- Stop it! Stop!

48:28.189 --> 48:32.749
Stop, stop, stop. Look...

48:32.849 --> 48:35.528
Look at him!

48:35.628 --> 48:38.911
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

48:39.011 --> 48:41.818
Stop, stop.

48:49.043 --> 48:51.393
Marty!

48:54.282 --> 48:58.576
Listen to me. Listen to me.
Listen to me. We have to go.

48:58.676 --> 49:01.022
Okay? We have to get the fuck out of here.

49:01.122 --> 49:03.725
- We have to go to the police.
- Why?

49:03.825 --> 49:07.662
Because the longer we stay here,
the worse this is gonna look. All right?

49:07.762 --> 49:09.572
Okay?

49:13.000 --> 49:14.819
Okay?

49:14.919 --> 49:17.975
Just stay with me, all right?
Just stay with me.

49:18.075 --> 49:20.358
Okay? All right.

49:34.755 --> 49:39.475
Lyla, shut up. Shut up.
Shut up, Lyla. Lyla, shut up!

49:43.430 --> 49:47.259
- Where are you going?
- I am not going to jail for him.

51:20.695 --> 51:22.911
Jesus Christ.

52:15.382 --> 52:17.198
Hello?

52:22.422 --> 52:24.605
Can you hear me?

52:29.529 --> 52:31.913
We're here to help!

53:03.029 --> 53:05.499
- Just stay here, okay?
- What are you doing?

53:05.599 --> 53:09.037
There could be somebody hurt down here.
I need... I need to go check it out.

53:09.137 --> 53:11.873
- No, no, please don't go.
- Lyla, Lyla, Lyla, Lyla, stop!

53:11.973 --> 53:16.846
- Please don't go! Please don't go!
- Stop! Stop it! Goddammit! Stop it!

55:10.390 --> 55:14.080
- Ed?
- Don't come down here!

55:43.691 --> 55:47.249
- What is it?
- What happened?

55:48.596 --> 55:51.432
I don't know. I think I blew a fuse!

55:51.632 --> 55:53.952
What's down there?

55:55.768 --> 55:59.908
- I can't see anything!
- Well, turn the lights back on!

57:39.873 --> 57:43.557
- Did that do anything?
- Yeah!

57:57.624 --> 58:00.600
Ed! Ed!

58:01.797 --> 58:05.533
Ed! Ed! Ed!

58:10.303 --> 58:11.557
Ed!

58:11.757 --> 58:14.864
Ed, what happened? Ed!

58:14.964 --> 58:16.714
Ed!

58:17.111 --> 58:19.613
Ed, what is it?

58:19.713 --> 58:21.790
Ed!

58:32.139 --> 58:35.696
What is it! What is it? What's happening!

58:35.796 --> 58:38.141
Lyla, stop it! Listen to me!

58:38.241 --> 58:40.780
Take the keys! Go to the road!
Go to the road!

58:40.880 --> 58:44.279
Go, Lyla, go! Go!

59:09.229 --> 59:11.646
Lyla, go!

01:00:13.026 --> 01:00:15.910
Please, please, please. Hello?

01:00:29.409 --> 01:00:31.225
Hey!

01:01:20.393 --> 01:01:24.476
Hey! Stop! Stop!

01:01:27.500 --> 01:01:29.550
Shit!

01:01:48.421 --> 01:01:51.512
Please! Please help me! Please help me!

01:01:51.612 --> 01:01:54.167
Please, please, I need your help!

01:01:58.012 --> 01:02:00.835
- What's the matter?
- I need your help!

01:02:01.235 --> 01:02:02.403
Has there been an accident?

01:02:02.503 --> 01:02:05.305
Yes! My brother... my brother,
he's been hurt! Please!

01:02:05.405 --> 01:02:07.751
- Where are you coming from?
- Please, please! There's no time!

01:02:07.851 --> 01:02:11.545
- We have to go now!
- Ma'am? Where are you coming from?

01:02:11.645 --> 01:02:13.981
The house... the house
at the end of the street!

01:02:14.081 --> 01:02:15.383
Way down at the end?

01:02:15.483 --> 01:02:17.951
Please, I need a phone!
I need to call the police!

01:02:18.051 --> 01:02:20.788
The police? Why would you wanna do that?

01:02:20.888 --> 01:02:22.859
We were attacked!

01:02:22.959 --> 01:02:25.568
My brother's dead!

01:02:25.959 --> 01:02:27.595
What? Was it an animal?

01:02:27.695 --> 01:02:31.832
Please, we don't have time!
Please we have to go now!

01:02:31.932 --> 01:02:35.169
- Ma'am. Was it an animal?
- No!

01:02:35.269 --> 01:02:37.371
Well, what was it?

01:02:37.471 --> 01:02:39.263
A pod!

01:02:39.363 --> 01:02:44.125
A government experiment
or something! I don't know!

01:02:44.744 --> 01:02:46.480
Please! We need the police!

01:02:46.580 --> 01:02:50.283
Ma'am? It wasn't a government experiment.

01:04:42.895 --> 01:04:45.178
It's not getting better.

01:04:47.366 --> 01:04:49.436
That thing down there,
it's got something in its blood.

01:04:49.536 --> 01:04:52.105
It infected me here or something.

01:04:52.205 --> 01:04:56.677
I swear to God, if you let it
scratch you... it'll infect you.

01:04:56.777 --> 01:04:58.892
Fuck me, man!

01:08:48.073 --> 01:08:50.590
Fuck you!

01:09:27.479 --> 01:09:30.404
I did it. I did it!

01:09:30.505 --> 01:09:32.520
I did it!

01:09:34.886 --> 01:09:37.037
I did it.

01:09:43.662 --> 01:09:46.446
Martin, I did it!

01:09:54.440 --> 01:09:56.490
Lyla!

01:10:00.096 --> 01:10:02.637
Lyla, I did it!

01:10:14.977 --> 01:10:17.393
Lyla!

01:10:24.103 --> 01:10:26.561
Lyla!

01:10:29.241 --> 01:10:31.625
Come back!

01:10:33.446 --> 01:10:35.799
I did it!

01:10:37.010 --> 01:10:38.759
I did...

01:11:55.361 --> 01:11:57.201
Fuck!

01:12:13.712 --> 01:12:15.549
<i>Confirmation?</i>

01:12:16.049 --> 01:12:19.299
- It's Smith.
- <i>Go ahead.</i>

01:12:21.587 --> 01:12:24.001
Oh, I found it.

01:12:25.692 --> 01:12:29.886
But the yokels have killed it
before I even got here.

01:12:32.798 --> 01:12:35.035
Goddamn it!

01:12:35.735 --> 01:12:37.906
<i>Any survivors?</i>

01:12:38.838 --> 01:12:40.699
No.

01:12:42.041 --> 01:12:44.905
Which means we're getting closer.

01:12:45.245 --> 01:12:47.814
<i>Is there any evidence of a colony?</i>

01:12:48.714 --> 01:12:50.755
Not yet.

01:12:51.717 --> 01:12:54.070
I'll check the woods.

01:12:54.170 --> 01:12:57.722
<i>Forward your coordinates.
A team is on its way.</i>

01:12:58.549 --> 01:12:59.966
Got it.

01:13:03.629 --> 01:13:06.513
Fuck!
