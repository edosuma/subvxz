WEBVTT

00:02.017 --> 00:03.181
Claire: <i>Previously...</i>

00:03.204 --> 00:04.156
Colum doesna travel,

00:04.170 --> 00:05.879
So visiting the
tenants and tacksmen

00:05.999 --> 00:07.090
That can't come
to the gathering,

00:07.108 --> 00:08.058
That falls to me.

00:08.092 --> 00:10.813
Have you seen any of
your scottish companions

00:10.852 --> 00:12.762
Raise funds for the rebellion?

00:12.797 --> 00:14.556
Let's get on with it.
Randall: Why would Dougal MacKenzie

00:14.589 --> 00:16.056
Rather adopt you
as one of his own

00:16.081 --> 00:17.094
Than allow me to question you?

00:17.127 --> 00:19.009
<i>I was wondering
if you had a potion</i>

00:19.023 --> 00:21.979
That might open a
lad's heart to a lassie.

00:26.687 --> 00:27.621
What's his name?

00:28.178 --> 00:29.607
Horrocks.

00:29.619 --> 00:32.140
There's a chance to get the
price lifted from my head.

00:32.207 --> 00:34.290
A redcoat deserter.
Claims he was there,

00:34.446 --> 00:36.479
Saw who actually
killed the sergeant.

00:36.504 --> 00:39.135
Claire: <i>I knew where we were
going without having to ask,</i>

00:39.154 --> 00:43.089
<i>The province of a man I
unfortunately knew all too well.</i>

00:43.101 --> 00:46.099
I'll thank ye to take
your hands off my wife.

01:05.001 --> 01:07.015
Dougal: Where's your mind, lad?

01:07.215 --> 01:08.495
Horrocks is waiting.

01:08.910 --> 01:10.270
Let's get what we came for.

01:23.215 --> 01:26.525
Already washed the dust from
your throat Mr. Horrocks?

01:27.431 --> 01:31.821
It would be wise if you told us what
happened that night in Fort William.

01:37.387 --> 01:41.657
Did you or did you not tell Hugh Monroe,
you saw who shot the Sergeant?

01:43.951 --> 01:44.951
I did.

01:46.872 --> 01:48.116
Forgive me, but I...

01:48.198 --> 01:51.479
I haven't tasted
fine whiskey like that in quite some time.

01:51.679 --> 01:53.289
I can use another wee nip.

01:58.683 --> 01:59.774
I'm eager,

01:59.798 --> 02:03.409
That you name the person who committed
the crime I was falsely accused of.

02:03.450 --> 02:06.280
Have you the gold Hugh
Monroe promised to pay?

02:06.881 --> 02:07.881
Yes.

02:08.309 --> 02:09.399
Then hand it over

02:09.715 --> 02:11.195
and we'll move on with the business.

02:11.395 --> 02:12.435
The name, first.

02:13.704 --> 02:16.507
You'll have it when I
have the gold in my hand.

02:16.707 --> 02:18.627
Well that was the understanding

02:21.035 --> 02:22.185
Give him the gold.

02:23.889 --> 02:24.979
I trust his word.

02:25.385 --> 02:27.525
The British army
trusted him, too.

02:32.017 --> 02:35.707
Perhaps today's not such a
good day for business after all.

02:36.379 --> 02:39.909
Whether you deserted is no
concern of ours, Mr. Horrocks.

02:40.322 --> 02:41.642
We commend ye for it.

02:42.857 --> 02:44.227
I've come a long way,

02:46.016 --> 02:47.942
At considerable
danger to myself,

02:47.943 --> 02:50.998
Eluding redcoat patrols...
(speaking other language)

03:01.985 --> 03:03.775
The man who shot the sergeant

03:04.729 --> 03:07.188
Was captain Jonathan Randall himself.

03:08.331 --> 03:10.523
Ye expect us to believe
that a captain,

03:10.524 --> 03:11.782
Even one as vile as black jack,

03:11.783 --> 03:12.819
Would shoot his own man?

03:14.463 --> 03:15.563
You know Randall.

03:16.182 --> 03:17.972
I suppose he can answer that.

03:17.973 --> 03:19.900
I canna use Randall's
name to clear my own.

03:20.025 --> 03:23.315
You bargained for a name.
A name is what you received.

03:25.933 --> 03:26.933
Good day, lads.

03:30.404 --> 03:31.404
Let him go.

03:31.907 --> 03:32.907
Man: Jamie!

03:33.341 --> 03:34.341
Jamie!

03:38.178 --> 03:39.178
Claire.

03:41.875 --> 03:43.467
I was minding her, I swear.

03:43.587 --> 03:45.257
I went for a piss and...
Where is she?

03:45.299 --> 03:47.370
She must've wandered off,
and when I caught up,

03:47.577 --> 03:48.886
The redcoats had her.

03:48.912 --> 03:50.538
She was fighting
and thrashing about,

03:50.580 --> 03:52.558
But they took her.
They were headed south.

03:52.991 --> 03:54.810
Hold on, Fort William?

03:55.069 --> 03:57.861
I know what's on your mind boy,
but what you're thinking is impossible.

03:57.897 --> 03:59.383
I'm going with or without you!

03:59.408 --> 04:00.590
Then Dougal and I must abstain from

04:00.626 --> 04:02.871
any open action
against the British garrison.

04:02.917 --> 04:06.273
If we were captured, then the
consequences upon the clan and Colum...

04:06.298 --> 04:08.948
No...
the risks are too great, I'm afraid.

04:09.600 --> 04:12.640
Any man wants to ride with you
I'll not stop 'em.

04:19.188 --> 04:21.438
I'm not beseachin'
anyone for help.

04:21.938 --> 04:24.058
But I'm also not
proud to refuse.

04:24.101 --> 04:25.241
I'll go with you.

04:25.462 --> 04:27.128
I'm not doing
nothing special today...

04:27.153 --> 04:29.660
- but a wee ride might be
amusing.

04:29.780 --> 04:32.910
Fine, but our conditions
you will have to heed.

04:46.280 --> 04:51.711
♪ Sing me a song of a lass that is gone

04:52.000 --> 04:56.755

06:47.765 --> 06:49.552
I don't know who you mean.

06:50.094 --> 06:52.709
My friend here isna a bit
pleased with yer answer.

06:52.743 --> 06:54.631
Pray, I don't know.

06:55.608 --> 06:56.878
Pray that you do.

06:56.879 --> 06:59.737
Or your next words'll be
in a lassie's voice.

07:02.872 --> 07:04.382
The commander's office.

07:04.646 --> 07:05.775
In the tower.

07:08.514 --> 07:09.845
Thank you.

07:14.651 --> 07:15.991
(bird calling signal)

07:45.735 --> 07:47.805
Murtagh, don't ye wait too long.

08:46.563 --> 08:48.355
Claire: Help!

09:54.127 --> 09:57.429
I'll thank ye to take
your hands off my wife.

09:59.399 --> 10:00.399
Good god.

10:01.434 --> 10:02.434
(laughs)

10:05.371 --> 10:07.638
Dougal MacKenzie
neglected to mention

10:07.680 --> 10:09.824
that you married
the stripe-backed thief.

10:09.944 --> 10:12.374
How's my handiwork
looking these days?

10:13.282 --> 10:14.413
Very well,

10:18.451 --> 10:19.791
Despite your efforts.

10:20.387 --> 10:24.106
I don't suppose you'd show me?

10:24.758 --> 10:26.708
Be the last thing you ever saw.

10:28.699 --> 10:29.275
Oh.

10:29.869 --> 10:33.351
Only risk brings the
tpossibility of reward, hmm?

10:33.866 --> 10:36.263
Just shoot this bastard, Jamie.

10:36.383 --> 10:38.085
(screams)

10:39.205 --> 10:41.201
Do. Shoot me.
Shoot us both.

10:41.243 --> 10:43.568
And alarm the entire fort
of your presence.

10:46.246 --> 10:47.246
Oh.

10:47.748 --> 10:51.760
It appears we're to have
an audience, madam.

10:52.518 --> 10:55.358
I think we should endeavor
to enjoy ourselves.

10:56.322 --> 10:57.482
I certainly shall.

10:58.324 --> 11:01.509
Now, put that pistol
on the table

11:01.629 --> 11:05.868
And let us commence with
the evening's entertainment.

11:06.817 --> 11:08.200
Do it.

11:09.340 --> 11:10.402
Slowly.

11:13.773 --> 11:16.183
I will slit her throat,
I swear to god.

11:20.380 --> 11:21.380
Slowly.

11:29.188 --> 11:30.568
That wasn't too hard.

11:31.658 --> 11:32.658
Back you go.

11:35.194 --> 11:36.332
Do it!

11:40.255 --> 11:41.873
Get out of here, Jamie.

11:42.435 --> 11:43.435
Just go. Go!

11:44.305 --> 11:45.767
Everyone, keep calm.

11:46.476 --> 11:47.673
(whimpers)

11:50.343 --> 11:51.523
Easy does it.

11:56.349 --> 11:57.075
(laughs)

11:57.318 --> 11:59.285
Oh, first she orders
you to fire,

11:59.324 --> 12:00.757
Now she orders you to flee.

12:00.799 --> 12:02.629
Who is the man
in this marriage, Fraser?

12:02.630 --> 12:04.942
I will cut off
your balls, I swear.

12:05.554 --> 12:08.131
You are
a foul-mouthed scold.

12:08.595 --> 12:10.115
For the life of me,

12:10.778 --> 12:15.213
I cannot understand why any
man would pledge himself

12:16.907 --> 12:18.285
To a woman.

12:19.095 --> 12:22.905
Especially such a mendacius
slut as this one.

12:26.865 --> 12:30.860
Would you like your
husband to join us maybe?

12:32.518 --> 12:34.358
What do you say, Fraser, hmm?

12:35.322 --> 12:36.322
Huh?

12:37.390 --> 12:39.230
Or would you prefer to watch?

12:57.127 --> 12:59.854
You bluffed your way in
here with an empty pistol.

13:00.646 --> 13:02.063
Ned said not to kill anyone,

13:02.064 --> 13:03.879
So I had all the
weapons unloaded.

13:03.984 --> 13:04.984
This way.

13:07.720 --> 13:08.720
Wait.

14:41.650 --> 14:42.650
Up here.

14:45.650 --> 14:47.849
You are sure there's water
down there, aren't you?

14:47.850 --> 14:50.488
Aye. I think so.

15:34.100 --> 15:36.700
Still a couple hours' ride
from the drover

15:37.500 --> 15:39.230
We should water the horses.

15:52.700 --> 15:54.830
Give him a drink of water,
will ya?

15:56.015 --> 15:57.015
Aye.

16:13.137 --> 16:14.287
Are you all right?

16:15.800 --> 16:17.640
Randall, he didn't hurt you?

16:19.150 --> 16:21.620
No, He didn't have time,
thanks to you.

16:28.821 --> 16:30.943
I'm waiting for you
to say something.

16:31.143 --> 16:33.413
Anything that approaches
an apology.

16:35.450 --> 16:36.450
An apology?

16:39.642 --> 16:41.892
I was taken hostage
by Jack Randall.

16:43.282 --> 16:45.700
Are you trying to say
that's somehow my fault?

16:45.900 --> 16:47.340
Well, it is your fault.

16:47.900 --> 16:51.499
Had you stayed put where I ordered you to
stay, None of this would have happened.

16:51.500 --> 16:53.699
Yeah, but no.
Ye won't listen to me,

16:53.700 --> 16:55.499
Why mind me,
I am not but yer husband.

16:55.500 --> 16:57.699
Ye take it into yer mind
to do as ye damn please

16:57.700 --> 17:00.380
I find ye flat on yer back
with yer skirts up,

17:00.421 --> 17:02.189
And the worst scum of the
land between your legs,

17:02.190 --> 17:04.009
About to take you
before my very eyes.

17:04.010 --> 17:06.000
I begged you
to take me with you.

17:06.025 --> 17:08.361
And I told you there was
no danger in me going along.

17:08.510 --> 17:12.086
Would you
listen to me? No.
No, I'm just a woman.

17:12.300 --> 17:14.799
No, why should you pay any
attention to what I have to say?

17:14.800 --> 17:18.359
Women are only fit to do as
they're told and obey orders.

17:18.435 --> 17:22.750
If ye'd done that, we wouldn't be on
the run now with a hundred redcoats
on our tail.

17:22.869 --> 17:25.949
Try that again and I'll
slap you until yer ears ring.

17:25.950 --> 17:27.609
You're a brute and a fool!

17:28.000 --> 17:31.199
Do you think I went and got
Captured by the english on purpose?

17:31.200 --> 17:33.096
Aye! I do think
ye did it on purpose

17:33.121 --> 17:36.161
To get back at me for what
happened at the glade.

17:36.700 --> 17:37.700
At the glade?

17:39.150 --> 17:40.840
With the British deserters?

17:40.900 --> 17:44.710
You think, to punish you,
I went for a walk in the woods

17:44.830 --> 17:48.590
On the chance that some
British soldiers would be going by?

17:48.900 --> 17:52.863
Christ, Jamie, I went for a walk!
I ordered you to stay put!

17:53.300 --> 17:55.980
I don't have to do
what you tell me to.

17:56.100 --> 17:58.995
Aye, you do.
You are my wife.

17:59.782 --> 18:02.249
Oh, your wife?
Your wife.

18:03.300 --> 18:05.599
You think I'm your
property, don't you?

18:05.600 --> 18:07.950
You think I belong to you
and you can't stand

18:07.983 --> 18:10.310
For someone to have something
else that belongs to you.

18:10.500 --> 18:12.411
You do belong to me
and you are my wife,

18:12.436 --> 18:14.046
Whether you like it or not.

18:14.071 --> 18:17.629
Well, I don't like it!
I don't like it one bit!

18:18.693 --> 18:20.950
That doesn't matter
to you either, does it?

18:21.150 --> 18:23.281
And as long as I'm
there to warm your bed,

18:23.323 --> 18:25.910
you don't care what
I think or how I feel!

18:25.953 --> 18:27.820
That's all a wife is to you.

18:28.197 --> 18:31.747
Something to stick your cock
into whenever you feel the urge.

18:32.259 --> 18:35.554
Let go of me,
you fucking bastard!

18:35.605 --> 18:39.505
You foul-mouthed bitch!
You'll not speak to me that way!

19:12.240 --> 19:14.330
I went to you at Fort William

19:17.700 --> 19:20.470
Armed with an empty pistol
and my bare hands.

19:28.200 --> 19:29.480
When you screamed...

19:38.200 --> 19:41.171
You're tearing
my guts out, Claire.

19:53.600 --> 19:54.600
I'm sorry.

19:56.900 --> 19:57.900
Jamie...

20:01.000 --> 20:02.000
Forgive me.

20:19.000 --> 20:20.000
Forgiven.

20:25.000 --> 20:26.030
I'm sorry, too.

20:31.800 --> 20:33.380
I'll ask your pardon
for what I said.

20:33.421 --> 20:36.010
I was sore and I said
more than I meant.

20:40.000 --> 20:41.500
Will ye forgive me, too?

20:44.000 --> 20:45.000
Forgiven.

20:53.915 --> 20:56.500
Jamie: <i>She asked forgiveness
and I gave it.</i>

20:56.700 --> 21:00.040
<i>But the truth is, I'd</i>
<i>forgiven everything she'd done</i>

21:00.231 --> 21:03.200
<i>And everything she could do,
long before that day.</i>

21:03.400 --> 21:05.120
<i>For me, that was no choice.</i>

21:06.700 --> 21:08.260
<i>That was falling in love.</i>

21:39.036 --> 21:41.832
Looks like we'll be needing
a few more plates, then.

21:57.600 --> 21:59.453
So, while murtagh was

22:00.387 --> 22:02.287
Setting the fuses on the gunpowder,

22:02.334 --> 22:05.960
I sent three of the bloody
Jessies to meet the almighty.

22:06.800 --> 22:08.424
I'm not hearing this.

22:09.500 --> 22:10.791
When I heard the explosion,

22:10.816 --> 22:12.754
I thought the walls of
the fort would come down.

22:12.778 --> 22:15.921
Did ye use yer breath
or yer farts to subdue them?

22:18.200 --> 22:19.500
Are you calling me a liar?

22:19.700 --> 22:22.965
Aye, because ye are lying.
Ye killed nobody.

22:25.023 --> 22:26.100
Oh, oh.

22:26.300 --> 22:28.430
For god's sake, angus!
Sit down..

22:28.500 --> 22:32.000
Stop flapping yer gums.. Use it for
something useful for a change.

22:32.120 --> 22:35.600
Man: I'm not gonna
tell anything if you're taking that tone.

22:35.669 --> 22:38.319
I don't believe I've
properly thanked all of you.

22:38.357 --> 22:41.500
- For what you did last night.
Ned, have ye got any wine down there?

22:41.700 --> 22:44.600
Ned: Yeah, well, they do
actually have some rhenish.

22:44.800 --> 22:46.350
Quite nice, if I may say.

22:50.900 --> 22:53.420
It's been a long day.
I'll go upstairs.

23:02.400 --> 23:05.180
She doesna understand
what she nearly cost us.

23:05.300 --> 23:06.300
Aye.

23:07.600 --> 23:08.690
And she needs to.

23:22.000 --> 23:24.360
Think they'll ever
speak to me again?

23:25.600 --> 23:26.600
Aye.

23:28.800 --> 23:29.800
They will.

23:38.000 --> 23:39.210
Come to bed, Jamie.

23:41.200 --> 23:44.480
I'm afraid we've a matter
Still to settle between us

23:44.900 --> 23:46.410
Before we sleep tonight.

23:48.600 --> 23:49.600
What is it?

23:53.630 --> 23:56.280
If a man among us
had put the rest in danger,

23:56.400 --> 23:57.400
As you did,

23:58.400 --> 24:01.602
He would have likely had
his ears cropped, or been flogged,

24:02.600 --> 24:04.404
If not killed outright.

24:06.365 --> 24:07.669
I didn't know.

24:10.800 --> 24:11.800
Good...

24:13.400 --> 24:16.500
Well, I ken you're not yet
familiar with our ways,

24:16.700 --> 24:18.200
And that's some excuse.

24:19.900 --> 24:22.281
Still, I did tell ye
to stay hid.

24:24.950 --> 24:27.149
And if ye'd done so, none of
this would have happened.

24:27.150 --> 24:30.430
Now, the British will be
looking high and low for us.

24:30.550 --> 24:32.320
As for captain Randall...

24:35.513 --> 24:37.417
Well, that's
something else again.

24:37.455 --> 24:38.950
He'll be looking for you,

24:39.150 --> 24:41.149
Especially now that
he knows you're here.

24:41.150 --> 24:42.150
Aye.

24:42.950 --> 24:43.950
He...

24:46.650 --> 24:48.090
It's personal for him.

24:49.050 --> 24:50.370
I am so sorry, Jamie.

24:51.869 --> 24:54.600
If it were just me
ye'd hurt by it,

24:54.638 --> 24:57.259
I wouldna say more about it.

25:00.250 --> 25:04.043
But your actions put
all the men in jeopardy.

25:08.750 --> 25:09.750
Right...

25:10.750 --> 25:12.190
best get on with it.

25:15.850 --> 25:19.541
Ye've done considerable
damage disobeying my orders,

25:23.790 --> 25:25.850
And I'm gonna punish ye for it.

25:27.150 --> 25:28.240
What do you mean?

25:29.296 --> 25:31.450
Oh, you know
fine well what I mean.

25:31.650 --> 25:34.650
Now, get down by the bed
and lift yer shift, lass.

25:34.850 --> 25:37.503
I'll do no such thing.
Now, Claire...

25:37.749 --> 25:40.329
I have said I'm sorry.
And I am.

25:41.350 --> 25:43.150
And I will never do
such a thing again.

25:43.350 --> 25:45.480
That's just the point.
You might.

25:46.596 --> 25:50.204
Ye come from a place
where things are easier,
I think.

25:52.350 --> 25:55.531
Where it's not a matter
of life and death

25:55.967 --> 25:59.090
If you disobey orders or take
matters into your own hands.

25:59.150 --> 26:02.830
But it's the hard truth in places
and times like these that

26:03.533 --> 26:05.200
A light action can have...

26:05.250 --> 26:07.723
very serious consequences.

26:08.850 --> 26:11.420
All right.
You're right, of course.

26:12.350 --> 26:15.910
I will obey your orders, even
if I don't agree with them.

26:16.050 --> 26:17.050
Good.

26:18.372 --> 26:21.840
Now then, get off the bed
and we'll get this over with.

26:22.950 --> 26:26.522
What?
I said I would follow your orders.

26:26.752 --> 26:29.949
There's a difference between
understanding something
in yer mind,

26:29.950 --> 26:31.680
and really knowing it,
deep down.

26:31.850 --> 26:34.090
I can tell ye from
my own experience

26:34.775 --> 26:39.150
That a good hiding makes ye understand
things in a more serious light.

26:39.350 --> 26:41.970
But as I said, if it was just me

26:42.001 --> 26:43.360
you put in danger...

26:43.560 --> 26:44.560
But it wasn't.

26:47.510 --> 26:49.750
There's such a thing
as justice, Claire.

26:49.950 --> 26:52.070
You've done wrong
to all the men,

26:52.550 --> 26:54.049
And you must suffer for it.

26:54.050 --> 26:57.430
I'm yer husband.
It's my duty to attend to it.

26:57.490 --> 26:59.750
- I will not let you beat me!
You won't?

26:59.870 --> 27:02.530
I doubt you'll have
much to say about it.

27:06.410 --> 27:09.020
The lad's getting on with it.
Seems so.

27:09.350 --> 27:10.617
That is his duty.

27:12.250 --> 27:15.184
You're my wife, like it or not.
I'll scream!

27:16.014 --> 27:19.050
Well, likely, if not before,
certainly during!

27:19.574 --> 27:22.300
I expect they'll hear ye
in the next village.

27:23.105 --> 27:24.630
Ye've got good lungs.

27:27.390 --> 27:30.040
This'll go faster
if ye just yield, woman.

27:30.788 --> 27:32.800
I'm gonna make you suffer!
Oh!

27:33.394 --> 27:34.880
Well, ye already are.

27:36.050 --> 27:39.000
You're taking pleasure in this,
you barbarian!

27:39.250 --> 27:43.290
Sounds like holy hell up there.
I'm not sure who's punishing who.

27:45.450 --> 27:46.949
I'll never forgive you!

27:46.950 --> 27:48.781
If I can forgive ye
for what you did,

27:48.804 --> 27:50.150
You can forgive me, too,

27:50.350 --> 27:52.410
As soon as ye can
sit down again.

27:53.950 --> 27:56.540
You sadist!
I dinna ken, what's a sadist?

27:56.607 --> 27:58.110
As for my pleasure,

27:59.017 --> 28:01.170
I said I was gonna punish you.
No!

28:01.550 --> 28:03.730
I didna say I wasna
gonna enjoy it.

28:15.399 --> 28:18.110
I hope that Jamie wasn't
too harsh on ye last night?

28:18.310 --> 28:21.170
A skelped arse never did anyone
permanent damage.

28:21.219 --> 28:22.753
Looks like she gave
as good as she got.

28:22.809 --> 28:25.750
Ah, well, it might not be permanent,
but it hurts like hell.

28:25.950 --> 28:28.357
She'll not make
that mistake again.
Indeed. Yes.

28:28.549 --> 28:30.760
Come and have a seat
here next to me, lassie.

28:31.150 --> 28:32.870
No, thank you, I'll stand.

28:38.750 --> 28:39.750
Over there.

29:27.115 --> 29:29.062
Ah, it is good to be home.

29:30.294 --> 29:34.611
In the loving bosom of those who
hold us dear. There's no one about.

29:46.302 --> 29:49.065
I do not know about you lot,
but I'm starving!

29:49.265 --> 29:51.955
Go after her boy,
I'll keep to the mounts
.

30:01.890 --> 30:02.890
Sassenach.

30:03.880 --> 30:04.880
Claire.

30:07.786 --> 30:09.746
I prefer not to fall behind my wife.

30:09.903 --> 30:11.003
Then walk faster.

30:25.656 --> 30:28.686
Welcome home, my dears.

30:34.962 --> 30:38.779
It seems like yesterday that you ran
kitchen by steal food.

30:39.103 --> 30:41.502
- And now you've gone and married...
- Leave him be..

30:41.527 --> 30:44.274
Fussin' over him like that...
He'll be no use to anyone...

30:44.474 --> 30:45.474
Me especially.

30:45.968 --> 30:48.393
You are comin' back to the stables,
work with horses.

30:48.549 --> 30:49.549
Aye.

31:12.900 --> 31:14.650
Congratulations to you both.

31:15.668 --> 31:18.678
I look forward to hearing
all about yer nuptials.

31:21.000 --> 31:24.270
It's been some time since we've
had a wedding here.

31:34.750 --> 31:36.390
My profound good wishes

31:37.750 --> 31:40.581
For a long and happy marriage,

31:43.350 --> 31:45.466
Lady Broch Tuarach.

32:30.916 --> 32:32.744
I did not enjoy that one bit.

32:35.910 --> 32:37.874
Did you not notice the look
Colum gave me?

32:38.022 --> 32:40.102
It seemed friendly
enough for me.

32:41.233 --> 32:42.537
He did not eat or drink...

32:42.562 --> 32:45.382
He did not offer a single toast,
in our honor.

32:45.502 --> 32:48.820
To hobble all that way to the great
hall and stay scarcely a minute.

32:49.416 --> 32:51.836
What do I know about
clans ways?!

32:52.103 --> 32:53.133
Did not you see?

32:54.703 --> 32:56.542
He does not approve of this marriage.

32:56.742 --> 32:57.772
He is not alone.

33:00.055 --> 33:02.125
What the hell do you mean by such?

33:05.402 --> 33:07.312
Will you not answer me, Claire?

33:14.794 --> 33:16.321
I know what that means!

33:29.692 --> 33:31.018
Happiness is (...).

33:34.148 --> 33:35.258
Who said that?

33:37.459 --> 33:38.459
Me.

33:41.086 --> 33:42.086
Just now.

33:46.250 --> 33:47.250
Yes.

33:51.612 --> 33:52.612
Love.

33:53.393 --> 33:55.003
It is not a simple matter.

33:55.287 --> 33:56.287
It is like...

33:56.312 --> 33:59.712
try to plan for every season
from one moment to the next

34:00.681 --> 34:02.631
And when you ready for the sun.

34:03.787 --> 34:04.916
The frost comes.

34:08.579 --> 34:09.958
What do you know that?

34:14.982 --> 34:17.302
More than you think you ignorant putz.

34:22.114 --> 34:23.324
You mean my mother?

34:28.150 --> 34:30.090
I am a hard man, Ellen knew it.

34:31.266 --> 34:33.485
Your father had a gentle side.

34:35.655 --> 34:37.385
I thought it was a weakness.

34:38.522 --> 34:39.522
I was wrong.

34:41.983 --> 34:44.318
And by the time I realized that...

34:45.661 --> 34:49.761
your parents had pledged
themselves to one another.

34:52.971 --> 34:54.630
What's done is done, lad.

34:56.346 --> 34:58.366
It's what do you do next that matters.

35:02.444 --> 35:04.524
Colum awaits you
in his chambers.

35:07.095 --> 35:08.575
Tell him I'm on my way.

35:31.300 --> 35:32.300
Pardon.

35:35.850 --> 35:36.990
Why did you do it?

35:38.050 --> 35:39.550
I waited for you, Jamie.

35:41.750 --> 35:44.400
I was counting the days
till you'd return.

35:45.061 --> 35:47.361
I had no notion
about yerself and...

35:48.100 --> 35:49.950
It wasna something I planned.

35:50.700 --> 35:53.067
Then why?
Why did you do it?

35:55.260 --> 35:57.520
'Twas Dougal's
arrangement, ye see.

35:58.900 --> 36:01.770
It's no simple story,
I can tell ye that much.

36:02.100 --> 36:05.075
But an explanation
will have to wait.

36:05.610 --> 36:07.390
Colum summons me.
I must go.

36:08.450 --> 36:11.459
Aye. Ye canna keep
a MacKenzie waiting.

36:14.848 --> 36:16.288
But we'll speak again.

36:17.030 --> 36:20.192
Aye, you have my word.

36:28.106 --> 36:30.850
Ah. 'tis the bridegroom.

36:32.210 --> 36:33.210
Aye.

36:37.868 --> 36:41.916
Now that I have all three of
you weasels gathered together,

36:42.590 --> 36:45.020
Who would like to explain
Fort William?

36:45.698 --> 36:48.216
Is clan MacKenzie
going to have to answer

36:48.289 --> 36:50.354
for yer little raid, hmm?

36:53.170 --> 36:54.170
No.

36:55.100 --> 36:57.650
Any repercussions
will land solely on me.

36:58.751 --> 37:01.231
Captain Randall
will make sure of that.

37:02.560 --> 37:03.560
Fine.

37:05.432 --> 37:07.456
Now, back to the rents.

37:09.493 --> 37:11.461
As I say, it has been
a lean year for

37:11.486 --> 37:12.576
for some of the tenants,

37:12.601 --> 37:15.071
But we have
much of the stock
still to sell off,

37:15.230 --> 37:17.036
which should help the
tip the scales.

37:17.061 --> 37:19.661
What about
the other money
you collected?

37:20.518 --> 37:24.653
The money for the bonnie Stuart
prince Across the water, hmm?

37:44.249 --> 37:46.379
'Tis for the Jacobites,
is it not?

38:01.649 --> 38:04.380
Did ye not think that
one among the rent party

38:04.580 --> 38:06.600
Would remain loyal to his laird?

38:08.287 --> 38:09.910
Or at least, young Jamie, here,

38:09.935 --> 38:14.416
He does me the honor
of looking fittingly guilty.

38:16.914 --> 38:19.563
You mistake concern for guilt.

38:20.540 --> 38:21.990
My conscience is clear.

38:22.240 --> 38:25.623
I owe no loyalty to
Charlie or James.

38:26.910 --> 38:28.480
He speaks truth, brother.

38:31.311 --> 38:33.551
We merely used
the welts on his back

38:33.986 --> 38:35.906
to illustrate British justice.

38:38.810 --> 38:40.720
We raised that gold honorably.

38:41.849 --> 38:44.553
We never concealed
the fact from anybody.

38:44.870 --> 38:46.540
That we were raising
money to restore

38:46.559 --> 38:49.697
the rightful king to his throne.

38:50.587 --> 38:52.087
That, I might remind ye,

38:52.207 --> 38:56.254
is a cause more important
than any clan or man.

39:04.786 --> 39:05.786
Is that so?

39:08.170 --> 39:11.410
Well, this clan remains
under the charge of this man.

39:12.770 --> 39:16.470
It is still my pleasure to choose
what causes are supported.

39:17.930 --> 39:19.623
And the clan MacKenzie's welfare

39:19.648 --> 39:22.450
Comes before
any king or country.

39:22.570 --> 39:25.440
I've proved
my loyalty to you
time and again.

39:26.593 --> 39:30.883
I've collected your rents, I've fought
your battles, I've protected yer person

39:30.945 --> 39:34.475
For the love of Christ, I've even assured
your bloodline!

39:38.552 --> 39:41.382
Now, I think that such fealty is

39:41.408 --> 39:43.125
worth a mere bag of gold,

39:46.180 --> 39:47.180
Don't you?

39:52.843 --> 39:53.843
Leave my sight.

40:09.469 --> 40:12.101
I shall try to
calm his distemper.

40:13.360 --> 40:15.710
Either that
or I will calm it for him.

40:19.927 --> 40:22.987
Perhaps you'd rather
chastise me at a later time?

40:23.430 --> 40:24.430
Stay.

40:36.200 --> 40:37.963
I opened my home to you

40:37.989 --> 40:39.810
as sanctuary from the British.

40:41.800 --> 40:42.820
I gave my food,

40:43.600 --> 40:45.205
I gave my hospitality.

40:46.447 --> 40:49.618
Even when you refused
to pledge fealty to me,

40:50.050 --> 40:53.312
I continued to grant ye
quarter and protection.

40:53.854 --> 40:55.969
And how am I recompensed?

40:57.900 --> 40:59.290
You marry a Sassenach,

41:01.090 --> 41:02.869
Knowing well enough
that none in the clan

41:02.894 --> 41:05.070
Will support ye now
as my successor.

41:05.270 --> 41:07.959
I meant no such betrayal, uncle.

41:10.611 --> 41:13.781
And it will be given you to
opportunity to prove it.

41:16.408 --> 41:18.008
What do you want me to do?

41:29.010 --> 41:31.900
My brother must never
be allowed to succeed me,

41:32.502 --> 41:33.952
as chief of MacKenzies.

41:50.684 --> 41:51.774
Do you not agree?

41:55.790 --> 41:56.790
Dougal has,

41:56.849 --> 41:58.666
a fiery temper that
can not be easily...

41:58.691 --> 42:01.451
Say no more.
I have seen we are in agreement.

42:02.027 --> 42:04.337
I have his replacement
still in mind.

42:06.207 --> 42:07.477
He stands before me.

42:10.730 --> 42:11.730
But...

42:12.897 --> 42:13.897
But you've

42:14.162 --> 42:15.502
already declared,

42:16.086 --> 42:18.201
that my marriage precludes
me from that honor.

42:18.224 --> 42:19.614
For the time being....

42:20.249 --> 42:21.879
A marriage of convenience.

42:23.183 --> 42:24.778
I do not follow your meaning...

42:24.815 --> 42:27.925
I will not be stepping
down anytime soon.

42:28.242 --> 42:30.761
Nor is my health a
cause for concern.

42:33.445 --> 42:34.945
But this is not England.

42:38.253 --> 42:39.873
Life here can be perilous.

42:46.632 --> 42:48.195
For whom exactly?

42:50.109 --> 42:52.139
I ment no one in particular.

42:55.204 --> 42:56.644
Well, for a moment I...

42:57.587 --> 43:00.307
I feared you were
speaking of my wife.

43:05.820 --> 43:06.820
And if so...

43:10.135 --> 43:12.907
I will be forced to take
that as a threat.

43:16.025 --> 43:17.295
Of course you would.

43:18.589 --> 43:21.579
That is the precise mind of a chief.

43:28.640 --> 43:29.790
Claire: I knew it.

43:29.910 --> 43:33.777
That first time I saw Dougal and Hamish
playing together in the courtyard.

43:33.977 --> 43:34.977
Aye.

43:35.960 --> 43:38.209
Many have gossiped
about it in whispers,

43:38.210 --> 43:40.650
And every one of us in the
room already kent it well.

43:40.850 --> 43:42.418
But that's the first time
I've ever heard

43:42.442 --> 43:44.872
Dougal proclaim
he's Hamish's father.

43:47.216 --> 43:50.626
Thought Colum was going to
run him through right there.

43:51.137 --> 43:53.157
That would solve a few problems.

43:53.503 --> 43:56.913
Aye, if the storm canna be
calmed between the brothers,

43:57.380 --> 43:58.975
I'll be the one
to pay the price.

43:59.175 --> 44:02.700
It's hardly the first time he and
Dougal have been at odds, god knows.

44:02.900 --> 44:05.360
I'm sure it'll be fine
in the morning.

44:07.655 --> 44:08.655
Aye.

44:16.990 --> 44:18.200
What are you doing?

44:19.120 --> 44:20.860
- I thought...
- Think again.

44:36.924 --> 44:38.724
(...) it's not your affair.

44:38.959 --> 44:41.052
You're getting yourself too
inclined with that woman.

44:41.211 --> 44:43.589
It will affect my standing
with MacKenzie.

44:43.754 --> 44:45.415
And I'll have no more of it.

44:47.082 --> 44:48.082
My sweet angel.

44:55.995 --> 44:57.175
You can come out now.

44:57.375 --> 44:58.375
Jamie Fraser.

45:05.494 --> 45:07.504
I thought I was hid well enough.

45:08.409 --> 45:10.539
T'was your smell
that gave you away.

45:14.498 --> 45:15.733
A man's sweat.

45:16.882 --> 45:21.681
Couldn't be Arthur. He's too prissy
to ever work up a good lather

45:23.802 --> 45:25.003
Yes well...

45:26.282 --> 45:28.659
He holds a postion that does
not require much labor.

45:30.353 --> 45:34.640
He doesn't do much laboring
in any position. Hmmph!

45:39.378 --> 45:40.865
I saw your new bride.

45:41.850 --> 45:42.965
Earlier

45:47.177 --> 45:48.387
Don't worry Jamie.

45:50.507 --> 45:51.547
She'll recover.

45:52.328 --> 45:53.958
Despite you beating her.

45:55.177 --> 45:56.737
Claire is a strong woman.

46:02.481 --> 46:04.661
But if you ever tan her hide again.

46:05.248 --> 46:06.610
Or ruined her heart.

46:08.144 --> 46:09.144
You'd amazed,

46:10.289 --> 46:13.089
What my concoctions can do to a body.

46:16.955 --> 46:18.414
It would be a shame...

46:21.731 --> 46:23.787
To ruin such a pretty package.

46:28.572 --> 46:30.022
Your husband was right.

46:33.173 --> 46:35.373
You should mind to your own affairs.

46:46.080 --> 46:48.279
Dougal tells ye something,
it's as if it's law.

46:48.280 --> 46:49.536
You will beware.

46:49.561 --> 46:51.913
Devil, man.
He's just a lad.

46:53.000 --> 46:57.236
His mouth has been in Colum's ear
And his lips half up his arse!

46:57.264 --> 47:00.089
He gave Colum the moneys
collected for the Jacobites.

47:00.090 --> 47:03.250
And it wasna his to give.
It wasna Colum's to take.

47:04.180 --> 47:06.110
The MacKenzie
ordered me to do it!

47:06.310 --> 47:08.478
I was just serving my oath
to himself as given!

47:08.678 --> 47:10.158
Or would you have me
lie to the laird?

47:10.217 --> 47:13.140
If the MacKenzie asked you the same,
you'd do it, would you not?

47:13.326 --> 47:15.566
Not after what
he did to Dougal, no.

47:16.770 --> 47:19.081
And what about you, Jamie?

47:19.980 --> 47:21.660
Where does your loyalty lie

47:22.166 --> 47:24.416
Between the chief
and the war chief?

47:27.070 --> 47:30.350
Now, there is but one laird
of the clan, is there not?

47:30.870 --> 47:34.239
Enough of this blather.
The issue needs no debate.

47:34.290 --> 47:37.089
The lad shoulda come to us
for counsel afore taking action.

47:37.090 --> 47:40.930
For his disobedience, he's getting
the due course of punishment.

47:41.130 --> 47:44.176
Besides, this is MacKenzie business.

47:45.020 --> 47:47.330
You, Frasers, should
mind to yer own.

47:48.489 --> 47:51.440
Sand aside and let
us get back to ours. Hey.

47:55.110 --> 47:56.600
What's all this, then?

47:59.370 --> 48:01.330
I thought we were hunting stag?

48:03.570 --> 48:04.570
Aye.

48:09.180 --> 48:10.180
Who's with me?

49:01.926 --> 49:03.466
I ken I'd find you here.

49:06.476 --> 49:09.646
This has been your secret place
since ye were a lad.

49:11.322 --> 49:14.042
Not so secret
if you find me so easily.

49:16.614 --> 49:18.354
You promised we would speak.

49:20.009 --> 49:21.009
Aye,

49:24.804 --> 49:27.864
I remember the first time
I saw you, James Fraser,

49:28.849 --> 49:30.630
Comin' through
the gates of Leoch.

49:30.830 --> 49:33.480
I was only seven years old,
still a child.

49:34.610 --> 49:36.460
You didn't notice back then..

49:37.239 --> 49:39.609
How my heart lept when you were near.

49:40.791 --> 49:43.051
And you went away, all those years.

49:43.826 --> 49:45.036
I never forgot you.

49:47.044 --> 49:48.271
I'm wed now.

49:49.494 --> 49:51.564
And 'twas
a gallant thing ye did.

49:52.403 --> 49:55.420
Marrying the Sassenach
to spare her from the British.

49:55.579 --> 49:59.059
'Tis true the marriage was
Dougal's arrangement, but...

50:04.009 --> 50:05.109
You dinna look...

50:05.939 --> 50:06.939
very happy.

50:08.162 --> 50:11.322
Ye look like ye're carrying
the world on yer back.

50:17.096 --> 50:19.302
- Laoghaire...
- When you returned...

50:19.502 --> 50:22.612
When you took the beating
for me in the great hall,

50:22.919 --> 50:24.349
I knew I wasn't wrong.

50:26.088 --> 50:27.528
That you felt the same.

50:29.281 --> 50:31.929
And then, that day in the alcove...

50:35.399 --> 50:36.779
The way you kissed me.

50:41.277 --> 50:42.727
She was married before.

50:46.269 --> 50:47.929
But I've lain with no one.

50:49.843 --> 50:50.843
I want ye

50:53.992 --> 50:54.992
to be the first

50:57.030 --> 50:58.520
And only one to have me.

51:06.769 --> 51:07.769
No.

51:08.642 --> 51:10.953
I made a vow
and I'll not break it.

51:13.424 --> 51:16.180
Even for a lass
as bonnie as you.

51:18.807 --> 51:19.807
I'm sorry.

51:29.872 --> 51:30.872
I'm sorry!

52:00.904 --> 52:04.962
Colum's men took grievous offense
over how they treated Willie.

52:07.086 --> 52:08.066
- Where is Dougal?

52:08.080 --> 52:09.014
I don't care.

52:09.033 --> 52:11.627
But this has been smouldering
since we returned.

52:11.653 --> 52:16.236
We've got to douse this wee scrap before
it explodes and the heat reaches Connor.

52:16.261 --> 52:20.649
Aye, he'll be taking hands or even heads
if he thinks the clan's heard this.

52:26.878 --> 52:29.298
How do you stop
two dogs from fightin'?

52:30.246 --> 52:32.563
Without getting chewed
up yourself.

52:46.746 --> 52:47.746
Bastard!

52:49.859 --> 52:50.859
It's over!

52:53.601 --> 52:54.816
No! No!

52:55.898 --> 52:58.103
It's either carry on
fighting as enemys or,

52:58.909 --> 53:00.009
drink as friends.

53:01.123 --> 53:03.683
Murtagh, get these good lads some whiskey!

53:25.934 --> 53:29.646
You settled that scirmash like
a future leader of the MacKenzies.

53:29.846 --> 53:32.065
There's a reason you're not
known for your sense of humor.

53:32.117 --> 53:33.824
Well if it's plain talk you're after,

53:34.040 --> 53:35.823
here's something you could chew on.

53:36.437 --> 53:38.560
It's getting a wee bit uncomfortable
around here

53:38.600 --> 53:39.827
for my taste.

53:42.840 --> 53:45.687
Rupert's right.
This is not our fight.

53:47.090 --> 53:49.700
I'll saddle the horses.
Ye take hold of Claire

53:49.900 --> 53:51.740
And we'll be away
from here this very night.

53:51.850 --> 53:53.230
And how would we live?

53:54.180 --> 53:55.768
Horrocks was my best chance,

53:55.820 --> 53:57.767
And now, I may be even
an outlaw for good.

53:57.792 --> 53:59.342
We'll live off the land.

53:59.740 --> 54:01.750
Or has castle life made ye soft?

54:03.080 --> 54:06.950
Would ye have me sleeping under
a tree come winter with my wife?

54:07.160 --> 54:08.200
Leave her, then.

54:08.720 --> 54:11.241
We can send for the lass
when we find safe beds.

54:11.273 --> 54:13.910
Aye, spoken like
the unwed man ye are.

54:14.020 --> 54:15.497
For pity's sake, Jamie,

54:15.697 --> 54:17.587
It's either up tail and away,

54:17.651 --> 54:19.301
or we stay and pick a side.

54:19.431 --> 54:22.315
It's not like Colum's gonna
give Dougal back the gold.

54:24.770 --> 54:27.599
Not that I see that it
matters much either way.

54:27.600 --> 54:31.020
The bonnie prince isn't sailing
from Italy anytime soon.

54:31.575 --> 54:32.690
No,

54:34.520 --> 54:35.794
No, he isna, is he?

54:40.700 --> 54:42.587
Peace, you say? Peace?

54:43.200 --> 54:44.520
You come here and tell me

54:44.540 --> 54:46.553
That clansman brawls
with clansman!

54:46.586 --> 54:48.489
That my own brother defies me.

54:48.490 --> 54:52.155
How can there be peace until
such disloyalty is punished?

54:52.184 --> 54:54.063
Well, chastising the guilty
might sooth yer anger,

54:54.087 --> 54:56.119
But I doubt it will
accomplish anything more.

54:56.120 --> 54:58.749
The bad blood will only fester,
leading to more violence,

54:58.750 --> 55:01.360
Until the clan explodes
into open warfare.

55:02.531 --> 55:04.141
What would you have me do?

55:07.276 --> 55:10.046
Make yer brother a gift
of the Jacobite gold.

55:11.100 --> 55:13.650
You'd have me commit
treason to the crown?

55:13.850 --> 55:15.882
Sanctiona stuart restoration
to the throne?

55:15.901 --> 55:18.238
A stuart restoration is but
ian airy hope, my laird.

55:18.263 --> 55:19.883
There is no Jacobite army.

55:21.200 --> 55:23.322
The highland clans are too busy
reiving each other's cattle

55:23.346 --> 55:24.837
To even consider uniting.

55:25.800 --> 55:27.887
While bonnie prince Charlie
lounges idly,

55:27.906 --> 55:30.000
Being pampered by the pope.

55:30.045 --> 55:32.470
Aye. Aye, all that is true.

55:33.200 --> 55:36.760
Meanwhile, my own clan teeters
on the brink of civil war.

55:36.812 --> 55:39.240
Then remove the source
of the immediate conflict.

55:39.440 --> 55:41.899
Give Dougal back the gold
and ye pacify him

55:41.900 --> 55:43.120
and his companions.

55:49.200 --> 55:51.160
Let yer brother play the rebel,

55:51.500 --> 55:53.390
as long as he does it quietly.

55:54.840 --> 55:58.604
Let him whisper
of a free Scotland for now,

55:59.500 --> 56:02.530
while you bide your time.

56:03.200 --> 56:05.510
And wait to see
how events transpire.

56:06.700 --> 56:09.339
If bonnie prince Charlie ever
returns with a call to arms,

56:09.358 --> 56:11.990
you can decide then
which side to back.

56:12.900 --> 56:14.400
Dougal may be war chief,

56:15.100 --> 56:17.762
But he knows only you
can cry for war.

56:28.700 --> 56:30.950
Bring my brother
and Ned Gowan here.

57:02.000 --> 57:03.701
Are we to stand here all day,

57:03.729 --> 57:06.330
Or is there a purpose
to this summons?

57:22.500 --> 57:23.600
One day, brother,

57:24.400 --> 57:26.940
You'll talk your
head off your shoulders

57:27.060 --> 57:28.580
And right onto a pike.

57:39.400 --> 57:40.400
A month ago,

57:41.100 --> 57:43.440
You swore an oath
to me on this dirk.

57:43.950 --> 57:44.950
Ye recall?

57:46.300 --> 57:47.300
Aye.

57:48.000 --> 57:49.270
So tell me, brother,

57:49.700 --> 57:52.110
What's a man's
word worth these days?

57:55.200 --> 57:56.640
A bag of gold, perhaps?

57:59.000 --> 58:01.872
My oath to you
is an oath to Scotland.

58:02.700 --> 58:05.562
I've not broken it,
nor will I ever.

58:09.400 --> 58:10.400
We'll see.

58:44.000 --> 58:46.630
Go on, then.
Play the rebel.

58:47.300 --> 58:48.680
See where it leads ye.

58:50.125 --> 58:51.455
I thank you, brother.

58:52.610 --> 58:56.352
Ned, send a missiveto the
Duke of Sandringham,

58:56.906 --> 58:59.376
Inviting him to a
banquet in his honor.

58:59.770 --> 59:02.581
Best warn the men of the household
to keep their arses out of his reach.

59:02.604 --> 59:06.980
Sweet christ, man, Can ye not keep
that tongue of yers From wagging?

59:07.300 --> 59:11.059
Very wise, Laird, to get the
measure of the Jacobite cause

59:11.246 --> 59:13.500
From an Englishman's
perspective.

59:14.000 --> 59:15.906
It will take more
than yer approval

59:15.929 --> 59:18.336
To get back in my good
graces, Ned Gowan.

59:18.359 --> 59:21.689
Get out of my sight,
all three of you.

59:41.984 --> 59:44.194
Colum and Dougal have mended fences.

59:45.721 --> 59:48.517
Your safe to live in
obscurity for another day.

59:49.849 --> 59:51.049
It's not worth it.

59:51.169 --> 59:53.450
To have to live there alone.

59:54.576 --> 59:57.930
Well, there's no shortage
of Highlanders at Leoch.

59:58.484 --> 01:00:01.424
That's not the company I crave lass,
and you cannot as well

01:00:05.978 --> 01:00:09.168
Our lives in the Highlands
are steeped in tradition,

01:00:09.950 --> 01:00:11.547
custom and rituals.

01:00:11.750 --> 01:00:14.972
So I've seen.
And Colum chose
to risk looking weak,

01:00:15.261 --> 01:00:16.856
Publicly changing his position,

01:00:16.879 --> 01:00:19.692
because peace was more
important than custom.

01:00:21.100 --> 01:00:22.530
I saw a rigid man bend.

01:00:25.540 --> 01:00:26.750
It made me mindful.

01:00:30.550 --> 01:00:31.550
About what?

01:00:35.859 --> 01:00:37.489
Wives obey their husbands.

01:00:38.850 --> 01:00:41.349
Husbands discipline them
when they don't.

01:00:41.350 --> 01:00:43.550
Well, that's how
it was with my father,

01:00:43.750 --> 01:00:46.270
And his father and on
and on and on back.

01:00:48.900 --> 01:00:52.290
But maybe, for you and me,
it has to go a different way.

01:01:06.950 --> 01:01:09.720
I swear on the cross
of my lord Jesus,

01:01:11.450 --> 01:01:13.510
And by the holy iron
which I hold

01:01:13.950 --> 01:01:17.120
That I give you my fealty
and pledge you my loyalty.

01:01:18.250 --> 01:01:21.430
If ever my hand is raised
In rebellion against you again,

01:01:21.550 --> 01:01:25.245
Then I ask that this holy iron
might pierce my heart.

01:01:37.484 --> 01:01:39.044
Is it not enough, Claire?

01:01:42.623 --> 01:01:44.343
Do you not want me anymore?

01:01:51.378 --> 01:01:53.338
Do you wish to live separately?

01:01:55.350 --> 01:01:57.540
Well, that's what
I should want...

01:02:10.330 --> 01:02:11.529
But I don't.

01:02:22.407 --> 01:02:23.820
The key to Lallybroch.

01:02:25.550 --> 01:02:26.550
What?

01:02:28.300 --> 01:02:29.300
Yer ring.

01:02:32.746 --> 01:02:36.136
I had the blacksmith fashion
your ring from my key.

01:02:41.813 --> 01:02:45.433
Why didn't you tell me that before,
When you gave it to me?

01:02:47.070 --> 01:02:50.290
I wanted to wait until
I took ye back to Lallybroch.

01:02:51.370 --> 01:02:54.410
So ye'd know the place
was as much yours as mine.

01:02:56.084 --> 01:02:59.740
But now, I dinna ken when,
if ever, we'll get back there.

01:03:02.580 --> 01:03:04.080
Jamie, I...
And that...

01:03:04.740 --> 01:03:07.940
That thought does not pain me

01:03:07.959 --> 01:03:10.013
As much as it once might have.

01:03:15.400 --> 01:03:18.635
You, are my home now.

01:03:43.203 --> 01:03:44.413
I want you, Claire.

01:03:48.184 --> 01:03:50.770
I love you so much
I can scarcely breathe.

01:03:53.385 --> 01:03:54.782
Will ye have me?

01:03:58.190 --> 01:04:01.928
Yes. Yes, I'll have you.

01:04:53.280 --> 01:04:54.502
Listen to me.

01:04:55.886 --> 01:04:59.490
If you ever raise
a hand to me again,

01:04:59.523 --> 01:05:00.950
James Fraser,

01:05:01.474 --> 01:05:05.137
I will cut your heart out
and have it for breakfast.

01:05:05.257 --> 01:05:06.587
Do you understand me?

01:05:08.460 --> 01:05:11.148
Do you?
You have my word.

01:05:25.930 --> 01:05:28.273
You're mine.
<i>Mo nighean donn.</i>

01:05:29.610 --> 01:05:32.353
Mine, now and forever.

01:05:41.122 --> 01:05:43.606
And I mean to make you
call me Master.

01:06:43.050 --> 01:06:47.039
I am your Master
and you're mine.

01:06:49.440 --> 01:06:53.680
It seems that I can not
possess your soul

01:06:54.419 --> 01:06:56.954
without losing my own.

01:07:21.510 --> 01:07:22.510
Sassenach.

01:07:25.730 --> 01:07:27.245
Yes, Master?

01:07:29.070 --> 01:07:31.407
What does "fucking" mean?

01:07:34.520 --> 01:07:36.073
- What?
"Fucking."

01:07:37.990 --> 01:07:39.150
After Fort William

01:07:39.650 --> 01:07:42.524
you called me
a "fucking bastard".

01:07:44.780 --> 01:07:48.804
Well, that means
what we just did.

01:07:51.790 --> 01:07:54.680
What about "sadist"?
Ye called me that as well.

01:07:57.368 --> 01:08:02.822
Well, that means someone
who takes sexual pleasure

01:08:02.942 --> 01:08:04.274
in hurting someone.

01:08:07.799 --> 01:08:11.106
Oh, well.
Ye dinna flatter me overmuch,

01:08:11.152 --> 01:08:14.634
But I canna fault
yer observations.

01:08:27.633 --> 01:08:29.470
Oh. Was I too rough on you?

01:08:30.830 --> 01:08:34.160
Well, If you bed a vixen,

01:08:34.279 --> 01:08:36.700
you have to expect to get bit.

01:08:38.408 --> 01:08:41.568
Come here and bite me some more.

01:08:48.799 --> 01:08:52.142
I'm ravenous.
Hmm. So am I.

01:09:00.877 --> 01:09:03.932
You meant food.
Mmm-hmm.

01:09:05.020 --> 01:09:07.970
I'll go to the kitchen,
fetch us something to eat.

01:09:19.951 --> 01:09:21.314
What on earth is this?

01:09:24.770 --> 01:09:27.600
Where'd ye get that?
- It was just there.

01:09:28.880 --> 01:09:30.240
What's wrong?
What is it?

01:09:33.124 --> 01:09:34.600
It's an ill-wish.

01:09:36.560 --> 01:09:37.740
Which is?

01:09:40.038 --> 01:09:43.035
It's meant to bring pain or harm

01:09:44.703 --> 01:09:46.068
or even death.

01:09:47.438 --> 01:09:49.618
Who would put such a
thing under our bed?

01:09:52.069 --> 01:09:53.069
Jamie?

01:09:58.050 --> 01:09:59.758
Laoghaire.
