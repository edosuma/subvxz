02:18.030 --> 02:19.490
I want a car.

02:21.740 --> 02:23.490
Chicks dig the car.

02:23.700 --> 02:26.451
This is why Superman works alone.

02:34.630 --> 02:38.420
Do try and bring this one
back in one piece, sir!

03:08.330 --> 03:09.620
Don't wait up, Al.

03:09.790 --> 03:11.830
I'll cancel the pizzas.

03:27.760 --> 03:29.220
<i>Batman,</i>

03:29.390 --> 03:31.640
<i>a new villain has commandeered</i>
<i>the Gotham Museum.</i>

03:31.810 --> 03:33.690
<i>He's frozen</i>
<i>the antiquities wing.</i>

03:33.940 --> 03:36.360
<i>He's turned</i>
<i>the security guards into ice.</i>

03:36.560 --> 03:38.820
<i>He's calling himself, "Mr. Freeze."</i>

03:39.070 --> 03:40.860
Mr. Freeze.

04:04.130 --> 04:06.720
Stop! Drop your weapon...

04:06.930 --> 04:08.220
...or we'll shoot!

04:21.779 --> 04:23.690
The Iceman Cometh.

04:25.200 --> 04:27.450
Please, show some mercy.

04:27.860 --> 04:28.990
Mercy?!

04:31.200 --> 04:35.910
I'm afraid that my condition has
left me cold to your pleas of mercy.

04:54.220 --> 04:55.810
In this universe...

04:56.020 --> 04:58.480
...there's only one absolute.

05:00.310 --> 05:01.570
Everything...

05:02.270 --> 05:03.570
...freezes.

05:09.320 --> 05:10.280
Hi, Freeze.

05:10.490 --> 05:11.740
I'm Batman.

05:31.010 --> 05:33.100
You're not sending me to the cooler.

05:50.990 --> 05:51.950
Nice catch.

05:52.200 --> 05:53.580
You break it, you buy it.

05:53.780 --> 05:56.120
Grab the gem!
Kill the heroes!

06:10.590 --> 06:12.390
Kill them! Kill them!

06:13.430 --> 06:15.430
Destroy everything!

06:26.320 --> 06:27.940
It's the hockey team from hell.

07:02.690 --> 07:03.730
Get the ice...

07:03.900 --> 07:05.440
...I'll get the Iceman.

07:31.630 --> 07:32.720
Thanks.

07:48.900 --> 07:50.110
Sweet.

07:54.820 --> 07:55.490
I got mine.

07:56.200 --> 07:57.570
Where's yours?

07:59.200 --> 08:00.910
What killed the dinosaurs?

08:01.540 --> 08:03.410
The Ice Age!

08:55.630 --> 08:56.840
Hit me, boys.

08:59.800 --> 09:01.600
Thanks for playing.

09:28.210 --> 09:30.290
I was hoping you'd drop in.

10:28.390 --> 10:29.600
Watch the numbers...

10:29.770 --> 10:32.270
...for they are
the harbingers of your doom.

10:32.440 --> 10:33.480
Can you feel it coming?

10:33.690 --> 10:36.570
The icy cold of space.

10:38.190 --> 10:41.950
At 30,000 feet,
your heart will freeze...

10:42.110 --> 10:44.370
...and beat no more.

10:53.830 --> 10:57.710
After you're frozen, your icy tomb
will plummet back to Gotham.

10:57.920 --> 10:59.380
Freeze, you're mad.

11:00.220 --> 11:02.340
This capsule explodes,
it'll slaughter thousands.

11:02.590 --> 11:03.680
Freeze well.

11:27.280 --> 11:29.660
- Who invited you?
- I was hanging around.

11:29.870 --> 11:32.660
I thought you'd stay in the museum,
round up some thugs.

11:32.870 --> 11:35.580
How about, "Nice to see you.
Thanks for saving my life."

11:48.810 --> 11:49.600
A Batbomb?

11:49.810 --> 11:52.560
We must blow this up
before it turns Gotham into a crater.

11:54.810 --> 11:55.940
Now what, call a taxi?!

11:57.060 --> 11:58.110
Watch the first step!

11:59.320 --> 12:00.360
Surf's up!

12:35.230 --> 12:36.690
Gotcha!

12:42.690 --> 12:44.190
Cowabunga!

13:02.710 --> 13:05.130
He's freezing the furnace!

13:45.670 --> 13:46.840
I got him.

13:54.060 --> 13:55.060
Stay cool...

13:55.220 --> 13:56.680
...Birdboy.

14:06.440 --> 14:10.200
Can you be cold?
You have 11 minutes to thaw the bird.

14:10.360 --> 14:12.570
Will you chase the villain...

14:12.740 --> 14:13.700
...or save him?

14:14.950 --> 14:16.240
Emotion makes you weak.

14:16.790 --> 14:18.870
That's why this day is mine.

14:20.420 --> 14:22.330
I'll kill you next time!

15:07.250 --> 15:08.380
Did we get him?

15:22.270 --> 15:23.310
Drats!

15:23.480 --> 15:28.400
My experiment to mate the orchid and
the rattlesnake has failed again...

15:29.110 --> 15:33.660
...but I still have hope for
the animal-plant crossbreedings.

15:35.410 --> 15:37.700
If I can only find
the right dose of venom...

15:37.950 --> 15:41.370
...these plants will be able to
fight back, like animals.

15:42.120 --> 15:43.920
I will have given flora...

15:44.120 --> 15:48.670
...a chance against
the thoughtless ravages of man.

15:51.880 --> 15:53.300
Personal note:

15:53.880 --> 15:55.840
My work would proceed faster...

15:56.050 --> 15:59.560
...if Dr. Woodrue didn't whisk
my venom samples...

15:59.810 --> 16:02.600
...back to his mysterious
Gilgamesh Wing.

16:03.230 --> 16:05.440
Why won't he let me in the lab?

16:07.610 --> 16:09.730
What is he doing in there?

16:27.080 --> 16:31.550
Ladies and gentlemen
of the un-United Nations...

16:31.710 --> 16:33.090
...and...

16:34.840 --> 16:36.340
...our mystery bidder...

16:36.720 --> 16:38.430
...may I present...

16:38.640 --> 16:40.720
...Antonio Diego...

16:41.310 --> 16:44.390
...serial murderer, serving life...

16:44.560 --> 16:45.520
...in prison...

16:45.730 --> 16:47.690
...and sole surviving...

16:47.940 --> 16:49.480
...volunteer.

16:51.270 --> 16:53.190
And what a charmer he is.

16:54.280 --> 16:58.870
By merely drilling three
concentric holes directly...

16:59.200 --> 17:02.910
...into Antonio's cranial cavity...
I have...

17:03.120 --> 17:07.119
...created viaducts into
the most primitive part of his brain...

17:07.750 --> 17:09.960
...the limbic system.

17:12.380 --> 17:14.339
And now I add...

17:14.510 --> 17:16.510
...my Super-Soldier Serum...

17:17.220 --> 17:18.300
...code-named...

17:18.890 --> 17:19.890
..."Venom"...

17:20.050 --> 17:23.270
...to which I add
my very own recipe of steroids...

17:23.470 --> 17:25.140
...and toxins.

17:26.980 --> 17:28.480
Plug him in.

17:28.690 --> 17:30.150
Time to scream.

18:03.850 --> 18:05.310
Genius!

18:05.600 --> 18:06.680
Behold...

18:06.930 --> 18:09.560
...the ideal killing machine!

18:09.810 --> 18:11.940
I call this little number...

18:12.440 --> 18:13.570
..."Bane."

18:14.020 --> 18:16.110
Bane of Humanity!

18:17.110 --> 18:18.200
Imagine it.

18:18.860 --> 18:22.660
Your own private army made up of
thousands of these super-soldiers.

18:23.450 --> 18:25.240
Bidding begins at a mere...

18:25.450 --> 18:26.870
...10 million!

18:27.120 --> 18:28.040
Turbo!

18:28.660 --> 18:30.290
Show off for Daddy.

19:12.120 --> 19:13.460
Dr. Isley.

19:15.880 --> 19:18.090
Welcome to my parlor.

19:19.380 --> 19:20.420
What?

19:21.090 --> 19:22.090
You monster!

19:22.470 --> 19:23.890
How could you?!

19:24.090 --> 19:27.430
Our original sponsor had
no stomach for military applications.

19:27.600 --> 19:29.730
He cut the funding for our work.

19:30.270 --> 19:31.810
Without your research...

19:32.060 --> 19:33.560
...I couldn't have come this far.

19:33.730 --> 19:34.650
Join me.

19:34.860 --> 19:38.110
The two of us,
entwined, side by side.

19:38.280 --> 19:39.110
Join you?

19:39.900 --> 19:44.360
I have spent my life trying to
protect plants from extinction...

19:44.570 --> 19:45.910
...and now you...

19:46.120 --> 19:48.450
...corrupt my research...

19:48.740 --> 19:52.290
...into some maniacal scheme for
world domination.

19:53.620 --> 19:56.040
When I get through...

19:56.250 --> 20:00.920
...you won't be able to get a job
teaching high school chemistry.

20:01.130 --> 20:02.550
Do you hear me?!

20:02.720 --> 20:04.930
You psycho!

20:07.260 --> 20:08.430
Well...

20:08.640 --> 20:10.600
...I can respect your opinion.

20:10.770 --> 20:13.480
Sadly, I'm not good at rejection.

20:13.640 --> 20:15.770
I'm afraid you'll have to die.

20:41.510 --> 20:45.340
Let the poisons and toxins
burn a grave for you...

20:45.510 --> 20:48.180
...deep into the earth
you love so much!

20:48.350 --> 20:49.970
Bye-bye, dear!

20:50.510 --> 20:51.890
Fellow maniacs...

20:52.140 --> 20:53.730
...bidding...

20:53.930 --> 20:55.640
...begins!

21:02.190 --> 21:06.150
Gotham University Labs
security video, 2 years ago.

21:07.780 --> 21:09.280
Dr. Victor Fries...

21:09.490 --> 21:13.790
...2- time Olympic decathlete and Nobel
Prize winner for molecular biology.

21:14.200 --> 21:16.540
After his wife
contracted a rare disease...

21:16.710 --> 21:18.000
...Macgregor's Syndrome...

21:18.210 --> 21:21.380
...he hoped to freeze her in a cryogenic
sleep until he could find a cure.

21:21.550 --> 21:24.210
Now, here's where
everything goes north.

21:31.220 --> 21:32.390
That's got to hurt.

21:32.680 --> 21:34.980
That liquid is 50 below.

21:35.180 --> 21:37.230
But, he survived somehow.

21:38.020 --> 21:40.520
The cryo-solution mutated his body.

21:45.400 --> 21:47.860
- What happened to his wife?
- No one knows.

21:48.030 --> 21:49.530
She's presumed dead.

21:49.740 --> 21:51.700
Freeze needs
extreme cold to survive.

21:51.870 --> 21:56.830
His cryo-suit uses diamond-enhanced
lasers to keep him at zero degrees.

21:58.210 --> 22:01.210
If it's ice the Iceman wants...

22:11.850 --> 22:12.970
Coming, sir.

22:14.600 --> 22:15.850
Yes, sir?

22:16.220 --> 22:17.810
We need the Wayne diamonds.

22:18.060 --> 22:19.770
We going to trap a snowman?

22:20.730 --> 22:24.610
Yes, right after you spend
10 hours in the simulator, training.

22:24.780 --> 22:28.200
I made a mistake. I'm sorry.
It won't happen again.

22:28.400 --> 22:30.450
You were reckless
and almost got killed.

22:30.610 --> 22:32.910
I'm fine! See!
Me, here, alive!

22:33.280 --> 22:36.240
How we supposed to work together
if you won't trust me?

22:39.410 --> 22:41.250
How indeed?

22:41.750 --> 22:43.920
He's overeager, he's impulsive.

22:44.090 --> 22:46.420
I can't trust him not to get hurt.

22:47.050 --> 22:50.590
Perhaps the truth is
you really don't trust anyone.

22:51.050 --> 22:54.050
Don't tell me
you're on his side again.

22:54.760 --> 22:57.100
Despite all your talents...

22:57.310 --> 23:00.480
...you're still just
a novice in the ways of family.

23:00.640 --> 23:01.480
Master Dick...

23:01.810 --> 23:04.110
...follows the same star as you...

23:04.480 --> 23:07.320
...but gets there by his own course.

23:08.070 --> 23:11.660
You must learn to trust him,
for that is the nature of family.

23:12.660 --> 23:14.490
I trust you, Alfred.

23:15.620 --> 23:17.950
But I shan't be here forever.

23:21.460 --> 23:23.290
Good night, Master Bruce.

23:25.670 --> 23:26.920
Good night, Alfred.

23:47.520 --> 23:49.530
Oh, dear, Master Bruce.

23:49.690 --> 23:52.110
Good gracious, what a tumble.

23:52.360 --> 23:54.490
There's a brave boy.

24:03.710 --> 24:04.370
Yes, sir.

24:04.540 --> 24:08.550
I am so pleased you won the bidding,
Your Supreme Ruthlessness.

24:08.840 --> 24:11.920
We're making the final modifications
on Bane right now.

24:12.130 --> 24:16.970
We'll have a flawless super-soldier
out to you tomorrow by overnight mail.

24:38.030 --> 24:39.910
Dr. Isley?

24:40.870 --> 24:42.540
Pamela?

24:43.870 --> 24:45.210
You look great.

24:45.870 --> 24:47.960
Especially for a dead woman.

24:49.040 --> 24:50.920
Hello, Jason.

24:52.210 --> 24:54.930
I think I've had a change of heart.

24:55.220 --> 24:56.430
Or quite...

24:56.590 --> 24:57.930
...literally...

24:59.100 --> 25:03.060
...the animal-plant toxins had
a rather unique effect on me.

25:03.230 --> 25:05.890
They replaced my blood with aloe...

25:06.060 --> 25:09.150
...my skin with chlorophyll...

25:09.400 --> 25:10.940
...and filled...

25:11.190 --> 25:12.940
...my lips...

25:24.250 --> 25:25.540
...with venom.

25:29.080 --> 25:31.040
And, Jason, one other thing.

25:31.960 --> 25:35.590
I probably
should have mentioned this earlier...

25:36.590 --> 25:37.630
...I'm...

25:38.590 --> 25:39.890
...poison.

25:46.640 --> 25:48.400
It's a jungle in here.

25:49.810 --> 25:51.570
I am Nature's arm...

25:52.480 --> 25:54.110
...her spirit...

25:55.030 --> 25:55.820
...her will!

25:57.110 --> 25:59.530
Hell, I am Mother Nature.

25:59.740 --> 26:01.700
And the time has come...

26:01.950 --> 26:03.790
...for plants to take back...

26:03.990 --> 26:06.790
...the world so rightfully ours...

26:07.000 --> 26:08.500
...because it's not nice...

26:09.830 --> 26:12.420
...to fool with Mother Nature.

26:18.510 --> 26:20.680
"Wayne Enterprises."

26:25.140 --> 26:27.060
Coming, Bane, darling.

26:27.600 --> 26:29.310
We've got a plane to catch.

26:45.160 --> 26:47.790
<i>I'm Mr. Icicle</i>

26:48.080 --> 26:49.920
<i>I'm Mr. Ten Below</i>

26:50.080 --> 26:51.540
Sing! Sing!

26:57.340 --> 26:59.090
Come on, sing!

27:00.340 --> 27:01.680
Louder! Come on!

27:01.890 --> 27:03.760
Sing! Sing! Sing!

27:03.970 --> 27:05.720
<i>He's Mr. White Christmas</i>

27:06.180 --> 27:07.470
Louder!

27:09.270 --> 27:10.810
<i>He's Mr. Icicle</i>

27:11.900 --> 27:13.270
Freezy...

27:13.730 --> 27:15.520
...I'm feeling hot.

27:15.730 --> 27:17.650
I find that unlikely.

27:18.360 --> 27:21.860
So my hair is
brittle and my skin is dry...

27:22.070 --> 27:24.240
...I'd weather blizzards to have you.

27:24.490 --> 27:27.040
You're the most perfect man
I've ever known.

27:27.200 --> 27:29.330
Let's heat things up.

27:29.580 --> 27:32.080
My passion thaws
for my bride alone.

27:33.920 --> 27:36.210
Talk about your cold shoulder.

27:42.010 --> 27:42.720
Frosty!

27:42.930 --> 27:44.140
Yeah, boss?

27:45.220 --> 27:46.510
Energy.

27:47.680 --> 27:50.270
Battling the Bat
exhausted my power.

27:55.110 --> 27:56.150
But...

27:57.320 --> 27:59.690
...I was successful nevertheless.

28:00.860 --> 28:02.200
Absolutely, boss.

28:02.400 --> 28:04.990
One more giant diamond of this size...

28:05.160 --> 28:08.160
...and my freezing engine
will be complete.

28:11.330 --> 28:12.790
I will freeze the city.

28:13.330 --> 28:16.080
Then I will hold Gotham ransom.

28:16.250 --> 28:18.670
Unless the city bows
to my demands...

28:18.880 --> 28:20.630
...it's winter forever
in Gotham.

28:21.260 --> 28:23.680
The city fathers
will have no choice...

28:23.880 --> 28:27.800
...but to give me the billions
I need to complete my research...

28:30.060 --> 28:32.140
...so I can find a cure.

28:33.440 --> 28:34.850
Leave us.

28:35.060 --> 28:36.190
Sure, boss.

28:38.270 --> 28:40.440
We need quality time.

28:57.000 --> 28:59.920
Soon we will be together
once more.

29:00.920 --> 29:02.460
Soon.

29:25.490 --> 29:26.610
I'll get it.

29:36.960 --> 29:39.710
I must've dozed off.
My sincerest apologies.

29:39.960 --> 29:41.500
No apology necessary.

29:41.750 --> 29:44.510
It's the first time it's happened
in thirty years.

29:57.520 --> 29:59.230
Please be looking for me.

29:59.520 --> 30:02.400
Actually, I'm looking for
Alfred Pennyworth.

30:06.950 --> 30:08.490
Uncle Alfred!

30:08.740 --> 30:10.070
My dear.

30:10.240 --> 30:12.030
Oh, my dear...

30:12.240 --> 30:14.700
...what a most wonderful surprise.

30:14.910 --> 30:17.870
How did you manage
to come here all the way from England?

30:18.080 --> 30:20.880
My dear, you are so kind
to your old uncle.

30:21.460 --> 30:22.460
Uncle?

30:25.800 --> 30:29.260
Barbara is the daughter
of my dear sister Margaret.

30:29.800 --> 30:33.220
Both my parents were killed
in a car accident 5 years ago.

30:33.390 --> 30:35.770
Uncle Alfred's been supporting me
ever since.

30:35.970 --> 30:37.730
- You have?
- Secrets, Al?

30:37.930 --> 30:42.060
Secrets are a virtual prerequisite
in this house.

30:42.270 --> 30:43.940
Don't you think, sir?

30:44.400 --> 30:45.360
I'm on break from...

30:45.570 --> 30:48.610
Oxbridge Academy,
Alfred's alma mater.

30:48.950 --> 30:51.780
The new computer sciences division.

30:51.990 --> 30:54.950
- How'd you know?
- Says so on the patch on your sweater.

31:00.170 --> 31:03.590
- What is it? It's beautiful.
- You can say that again.

31:04.170 --> 31:06.920
It's a competition racer.
I've been fixing it up.

31:07.130 --> 31:08.420
I'll show you how to ride it.

31:08.630 --> 31:10.430
You certainly will not!

31:10.630 --> 31:14.260
Don't worry, Uncle Alfred.
I'm terrified of these things.

31:14.430 --> 31:16.640
Barbara, I hope you'll stay with us.

31:17.310 --> 31:18.810
Oh, I don't know.

31:19.020 --> 31:22.190
All this luxury really isn't
my style, but...

31:22.980 --> 31:24.190
...yeah, I'd love to.

31:24.820 --> 31:26.150
Then it's settled.

31:26.650 --> 31:28.820
But, sir, we...

31:29.150 --> 31:31.320
...we do get so busy here.

31:31.490 --> 31:32.610
Don't be silly.

31:32.860 --> 31:34.450
After all, she's family.

31:51.880 --> 31:52.880
Uncle Alfred?

31:55.050 --> 31:56.850
I came to tuck you in.

31:57.060 --> 31:59.350
You came to tuck me in?

31:59.640 --> 32:01.350
That's quite a switch.

32:02.690 --> 32:04.150
What're you working on?

32:04.350 --> 32:07.860
I'm trying to find my brother,
your Uncle Wilfred.

32:08.230 --> 32:11.990
He's first butler
to the Maharajah of Miranjapore.

32:12.200 --> 32:15.160
But Miranjapore is a floating court.

32:15.370 --> 32:17.160
It travels through India.

32:17.370 --> 32:19.200
I remember Mom getting postcards.

32:19.370 --> 32:22.540
So Wilfred can be
rather difficult to find.

32:23.870 --> 32:27.090
I don't suppose they have
fax machines on elephants.

32:28.920 --> 32:31.380
I've been trying to reach him
with no success.

32:32.260 --> 32:35.220
When one grows ancient,
one yearns for family.

32:37.550 --> 32:40.390
I have the same picture of Mom
by my bed.

32:40.720 --> 32:41.680
Peg?

32:41.930 --> 32:44.520
My nickname for sweet Margaret.

32:47.270 --> 32:49.400
It's good to see you again.

32:50.280 --> 32:51.400
I've missed you.

32:52.530 --> 32:54.400
As I have you.

32:55.740 --> 32:57.240
Sleep well, child.

32:58.530 --> 33:00.080
You sleep.

33:02.160 --> 33:03.910
Go to bed.

34:08.980 --> 34:10.310
<i>Good morning, Gotham.</i>

34:10.480 --> 34:15.280
<i>It's Gossip Gerty reporting to you</i>
<i>direct from the Gotham Observatory...</i>

34:15.489 --> 34:19.989
<i>... where billionaire Bruce Wayne,</i>
<i>chairman of Wayne Enterprises...</i>

34:20.199 --> 34:25.159
<i>... is about to make yet another</i>
<i>legendary contribution to the city.</i>

34:26.330 --> 34:28.830
Gotham Observatory, Bane.

34:29.370 --> 34:31.040
And step on it.

34:32.040 --> 34:33.380
Step.

34:42.179 --> 34:46.850
<i>My father told me, "To succeed,</i>
<i>we need only pick a star and follow it. "</i>

34:47.679 --> 34:51.810
<i>So Wayne Enterprises is donating</i>
<i>the world's most advanced telescope...</i>

34:52.060 --> 34:55.190
<i>... to Gotham 's</i>
<i>Observatory Restoration Project.</i>

34:55.400 --> 34:56.650
<i>With any luck...</i>

34:56.940 --> 34:59.780
...this telescope will give
future generations a chance...

35:00.030 --> 35:02.030
...to follow their own stars.

35:04.410 --> 35:05.410
Brucy...

35:05.660 --> 35:09.620
...is it true that this new telescope
can see around the globe?

35:09.830 --> 35:12.540
Yes. If you'll watch
these monitors right here.

35:13.540 --> 35:18.260
Satellites in orbit allow us to reflect
light from anywhere on the planet.

35:18.720 --> 35:22.050
From here, we'll be able
to see the sky anywhere on Earth...

35:22.260 --> 35:25.010
...and through this
intricate network of satellites...

35:25.220 --> 35:29.560
...reflect it back to our
very own Gotham City for observation.

35:30.390 --> 35:32.100
Just don't point it at my bedroom.

35:37.280 --> 35:40.070
Brucy, you and the exquisite
Julie Madison...

35:40.280 --> 35:41.820
...have been going out forever.

35:42.070 --> 35:44.240
Are you going to tie the knot?

35:44.450 --> 35:45.240
Marriage?

35:45.450 --> 35:47.410
Marriage?

35:47.580 --> 35:49.870
You want to give me a hand here?

35:50.410 --> 35:52.580
Bruce and I are recklessly in love.

35:52.750 --> 35:56.460
And that's most certainly
enough for us... for now.

35:57.920 --> 36:00.880
If you will follow me,
I'll show you the central control grid.

36:01.300 --> 36:02.930
You're a lot of help.

36:04.720 --> 36:06.100
Miss, you need to stop.

36:06.300 --> 36:07.560
Move, fascist bulldog!

36:07.720 --> 36:09.930
- You need an appointment...
- No, I don't!

36:10.140 --> 36:13.060
Miss, you're not authorized
to be up here.

36:13.270 --> 36:14.440
She has no pass, sir.

36:14.600 --> 36:17.400
Little overly protective,
but you won't hurt me, Miss...?

36:17.610 --> 36:19.230
Dr. Pamela Isley.

36:19.440 --> 36:20.610
Doctor...

36:20.940 --> 36:22.320
...what can I do for you?

36:22.780 --> 36:24.910
Actually, I already
work for you, or did.

36:25.160 --> 36:27.780
Your arboreal preservation project
in South America.

36:28.490 --> 36:31.620
We cut our funding.
There was a conflict of ideologies.

36:31.790 --> 36:33.420
Dr. Woodrue was a lunatic.

36:33.620 --> 36:34.750
I see you knew him.

36:35.000 --> 36:37.960
Yes. That lab burnt down last week.
I'm glad you escaped.

36:39.300 --> 36:43.470
I have here a proposal showing
how Wayne Enterprises can immediately...

36:43.630 --> 36:46.640
...cease all actions
that toxify our environment.

36:46.800 --> 36:49.140
Forget the stars,
look here at the earth...

36:49.350 --> 36:50.890
...our mother, our womb.

36:51.140 --> 36:54.190
She deserves your loyalty
and protection.

36:55.150 --> 36:56.980
And yet, you spoil her lands...

36:57.650 --> 36:58.770
...poison her oceans...

36:59.150 --> 37:00.190
...blacken her skies!

37:00.480 --> 37:01.650
You're killing her!

37:02.360 --> 37:06.280
Your intentions are noble,
but no diesel fuel for heat...

37:06.490 --> 37:11.330
...no coolants to preserve food,
millions of people would die.

37:11.540 --> 37:14.250
Acceptable losses
in the battle to save the planet.

37:15.120 --> 37:17.420
People come first, Dr. Isley.

37:19.500 --> 37:20.670
Mammals!

37:21.510 --> 37:23.510
A day of reckoning is coming.

37:23.670 --> 37:24.800
That's right.

37:24.970 --> 37:27.680
The same plants and flowers
that saw you...

37:28.760 --> 37:30.760
...crawl from the primordial soup...

37:30.970 --> 37:35.270
...will reclaim this planet
and there will be no one to protect you!

37:39.360 --> 37:41.480
You must be new in town.

37:41.690 --> 37:42.650
In Gotham City...

37:42.820 --> 37:45.150
...Batman and Robin protect us...

37:45.360 --> 37:47.990
...even from plants and flowers.

37:51.370 --> 37:53.200
Maybe you'd like to meet them.

37:53.830 --> 37:56.250
Caped crusaders are
going to help us auction...

37:56.460 --> 37:59.000
...a diamond to raise money
for our botanical gardens.

37:59.710 --> 38:03.840
Just a few mammals doing what
we can for the world's plants.

38:04.210 --> 38:05.670
Thank you all for coming.

38:05.840 --> 38:07.130
Good day, Doctor.

38:16.560 --> 38:18.730
Batman and Robin...

38:19.230 --> 38:22.690
...militant arm
of the warm-blooded oppressors...

38:23.480 --> 38:27.150
...animal protectors of the status quo.

38:28.240 --> 38:29.700
First...

38:29.870 --> 38:33.580
...I'll rid myself of the fur
and feathered pests.

38:34.750 --> 38:36.830
And then Gotham...

38:37.040 --> 38:38.540
...will be mine...

38:38.750 --> 38:40.500
...for the greening.

39:01.810 --> 39:03.020
Excuse me, chief.

39:03.270 --> 39:05.900
I got something here
you might want to see.

39:12.820 --> 39:15.540
I hate when people talk
during the movie.

39:34.930 --> 39:37.100
One more diamond, my love.

39:38.100 --> 39:39.810
One more.

39:47.110 --> 39:49.400
"Bruce Wayne. Diamonds."

39:51.820 --> 39:53.120
Very nice.

40:37.990 --> 40:40.540
Ladies and gentlemen...

40:41.960 --> 40:44.710
...Gossip Gerty
of "Good Morning Gotham" and I...

40:44.880 --> 40:49.090
...welcome you
to the gem of the evening.

40:50.170 --> 40:52.550
Our own Commissioner Gordon...

40:53.010 --> 40:54.300
...displaying...

40:54.510 --> 40:57.890
...the famed Heart of Isis,
on loan...

40:58.100 --> 41:02.640
...from the collection of my
close personal friend, Bruce Wayne.

41:05.900 --> 41:07.560
Think Freeze will take the bait?

41:07.940 --> 41:09.320
He'll be here.

41:10.110 --> 41:12.780
...to dance with one
of our fabulous flowers...

41:12.940 --> 41:16.570
...the famed diamond
draped around her neck.

41:19.200 --> 41:21.910
Let's start the bidding!

41:22.410 --> 41:24.960
I'll give 10,000 for the orchid!

41:27.040 --> 41:29.340
20,000 for the tiger lily!

41:31.420 --> 41:32.550
And I bid...

41:32.760 --> 41:36.510
...30,000 dollars
for the lovely magnolia!

41:41.970 --> 41:43.600
Boys, please...

41:43.980 --> 41:45.690
...let's show some gusto!

43:52.900 --> 43:54.110
Hi, there.

43:54.900 --> 43:57.070
And you are?

43:57.480 --> 43:59.150
Poison...

43:59.360 --> 44:00.900
...Poison Ivy.

44:11.500 --> 44:14.210
Why not send junior home early?

44:14.630 --> 44:17.920
I've got some wild oats to sow.

44:19.590 --> 44:21.380
On the other hand...

44:22.720 --> 44:25.510
...youth does have its advantages.

44:26.260 --> 44:28.810
Endurance, stamina.

44:29.430 --> 44:31.810
Forget the geriatric Bat.

44:32.100 --> 44:33.650
Come, join me.

44:33.850 --> 44:36.110
My garden needs tending.

44:36.610 --> 44:38.070
I'll take it from here, pal.

44:38.230 --> 44:40.400
Wouldn't you like the earrings too?

44:41.240 --> 44:45.570
Some lucky boy's
about to hit the honey pot.

44:45.870 --> 44:49.870
I'll include an evening of my company
for the winner.

44:50.620 --> 44:53.000
I'll bring everything you see here...

44:53.170 --> 44:56.540
...plus everything you don't.

44:58.340 --> 45:01.260
I bid 50,000 dollars for Poison Ivy!

45:05.090 --> 45:06.260
100,000!

45:07.640 --> 45:08.850
And I'll bid...

45:09.060 --> 45:12.270
...500,000 dollars!

45:14.140 --> 45:15.270
One million dollars.

45:16.940 --> 45:19.150
- 2 million.
- You don't have it. 3 million.

45:19.360 --> 45:20.820
I'll borrow it from you. Four.

45:22.110 --> 45:22.990
5 million.

45:23.150 --> 45:24.780
That's a utility belt, not a money belt.

45:24.990 --> 45:25.990
6 million.

45:26.160 --> 45:27.070
7 million.

45:30.620 --> 45:32.080
Never leave the cave without it.

45:32.370 --> 45:35.830
You boys aren't going to start fighting
over little old me, now are you?

45:49.600 --> 45:51.850
All right, everyone!
Chill.

45:53.140 --> 45:54.020
Chill.

46:03.320 --> 46:04.280
Get the gun!

46:48.320 --> 46:49.950
Look at you!

46:50.160 --> 46:52.030
Let me guess.

46:52.660 --> 46:53.910
Plant Girl?

46:54.290 --> 46:56.080
Vine Lady?

46:56.830 --> 46:59.080
Hand over the diamond, Garden Gal...

46:59.250 --> 47:01.080
...or I'll turn you into mulch.

47:06.090 --> 47:07.550
Pheromone dust...

47:08.550 --> 47:09.800
...designed to heat...

47:10.010 --> 47:11.390
...a man's blood.

47:11.850 --> 47:14.260
Doesn't work on the cold-hearted.
If you please!

47:15.270 --> 47:17.310
If you insist.

47:20.850 --> 47:23.320
Clever little clover.

47:27.400 --> 47:29.570
That's my exit cue.

47:30.030 --> 47:31.280
Thanks.

47:42.710 --> 47:43.790
Good night.

47:45.960 --> 47:47.590
Cool party!

48:15.120 --> 48:18.290
Commissioner, you have 11 minutes
to thaw these people.

48:24.840 --> 48:28.760
Miss Ivy, you've just met
one of the most sinister men in Gotham.

48:29.170 --> 48:31.170
That's not a man...

48:31.340 --> 48:33.340
...that is a god.

48:39.470 --> 48:41.390
Enough monkey business.

48:42.270 --> 48:44.480
We've got work to do.

48:45.360 --> 48:46.940
Monkey work.

49:37.700 --> 49:39.080
You can't make the jump.

49:39.280 --> 49:40.410
I can!

49:43.160 --> 49:43.910
Pull back!

49:44.370 --> 49:45.420
I can make it!

49:45.620 --> 49:47.210
Redbird control codes.

49:50.210 --> 49:51.510
Disable engine.

49:53.420 --> 49:54.630
Don't do it to me!!

50:02.930 --> 50:04.180
We won't make it!

50:27.250 --> 50:29.380
It's a cold town.

51:00.780 --> 51:02.280
I could've made that jump.

51:02.580 --> 51:05.370
You could've splattered your brains
on the building's side.

51:05.540 --> 51:07.250
The Flying Graysons were a team.

51:07.500 --> 51:09.420
We had to trust each to do his job.

51:09.580 --> 51:11.630
That's what being partners is about.

51:11.840 --> 51:14.250
Counting on someone is the way to win.

51:14.460 --> 51:16.760
Your head wasn't on the job.
It was on Poison Ivy.

51:17.340 --> 51:19.510
Maybe she wanted me instead of you.

51:19.720 --> 51:21.470
That's your idea of friendship?

51:21.640 --> 51:24.310
It's your rules.
It's your way, or the highway.

51:24.510 --> 51:27.140
It's Batman and Robin,
not Robin and Batman.

51:27.350 --> 51:30.520
- I'm sick of it!
- Yes, it's my rules that keep us alive.

51:30.690 --> 51:34.070
If you want to stay in this house,
on this team, you'll abide by them.

51:35.230 --> 51:36.780
This is no partnership.

51:37.030 --> 51:38.530
You're never going to trust me!

51:45.370 --> 51:47.080
Dear brother Wilfred...

51:47.660 --> 51:51.540
...I have tried
every address I know for you.

51:51.710 --> 51:54.210
I'm just praying this reaches you.

51:55.050 --> 51:56.550
We have very little time.

52:13.110 --> 52:15.610
Batman monopolized the evening news.

52:17.860 --> 52:20.490
Congratulations on your
apprehension of Mr. Freeze.

52:20.650 --> 52:22.240
Thanks.
Thank you.

52:25.740 --> 52:27.410
Is there something wrong, sir?

52:30.580 --> 52:32.210
Am I pig-headed?

52:34.880 --> 52:36.420
Is it always...

52:36.590 --> 52:38.590
...my way or the highway?

52:39.050 --> 52:40.720
Why, yes.
Actually.

52:41.880 --> 52:45.640
Death and chance stole your parents...

52:45.890 --> 52:47.930
...but rather than become a victim...

52:48.180 --> 52:52.100
...you have done everything
in your power to control the fates.

52:52.730 --> 52:54.730
For what is Batman...

52:55.020 --> 52:59.650
...if not an effort to master the chaos
that sweeps our world?

53:00.610 --> 53:02.490
An attempt to control...

53:02.650 --> 53:04.360
...death itself?

53:24.220 --> 53:25.760
But I can't, can I?

53:27.550 --> 53:29.220
None of us can.

53:55.250 --> 53:57.540
Sorry. So sorry!

53:57.790 --> 53:59.210
Teach you that at Oxbridge?

53:59.420 --> 54:03.760
Just a few judo lessons.
You know, London's kind of rough.

54:04.090 --> 54:06.510
I suppose you had
a minor in motorbikes also?

54:08.890 --> 54:10.560
Couldn't resist.

54:10.720 --> 54:12.100
It's just so beautiful.

54:13.100 --> 54:15.890
I just took it out for a spin.
I'll clean it tomorrow.

54:16.270 --> 54:17.230
All right?

54:17.440 --> 54:18.610
Sorry.

54:19.270 --> 54:21.150
Sorry.
Good night.

55:06.570 --> 55:08.740
Drag him into the cold beam.

55:10.660 --> 55:12.530
Welcome home, Frost Face.

55:12.740 --> 55:15.750
You're the common cold,
and we are the cure.

55:18.040 --> 55:20.630
Allow me to break the ice.

55:20.880 --> 55:23.050
My name is Freeze.

55:23.340 --> 55:25.090
Learn it well...

55:25.340 --> 55:28.180
...for it's the chilling sound
of your doom.

55:40.060 --> 55:44.520
All right, Freezie, you can't live
outside the cold zone.

55:55.830 --> 55:57.830
Look at him stew.

55:59.920 --> 56:01.330
Get used to it.

56:01.540 --> 56:04.420
You're going to be here a very long...

56:04.630 --> 56:06.380
...long time.

56:07.800 --> 56:09.340
Sadly...

56:09.550 --> 56:11.930
...you will not live to see it.

56:23.810 --> 56:27.400
Batface and Birdbrain turned out
to be much more resistant...

56:27.610 --> 56:29.950
...to my love dust
than expected.

56:30.150 --> 56:34.160
No matter. Next time
I'll just give them a stronger dose.

56:34.410 --> 56:37.450
They'll literally be dying for me.

56:38.450 --> 56:40.620
"Turkish baths."

56:40.830 --> 56:42.750
This looks promising.

57:10.030 --> 57:11.900
A fixer-upper.

57:12.570 --> 57:14.660
But with a certain homey charm.

57:16.370 --> 57:17.660
A minus!

57:17.950 --> 57:19.700
Current tenants.

57:19.870 --> 57:22.830
Hello, my little pretty, pretty, pretty.

57:23.000 --> 57:24.790
Hello, yourself.

57:25.420 --> 57:27.000
You look good enough to eat.

57:27.670 --> 57:29.500
That I am.

57:30.010 --> 57:32.880
Come and get me,
if you can.

57:35.680 --> 57:37.350
With pleasure.

57:57.740 --> 57:59.330
Let's redecorate.

58:08.500 --> 58:11.760
I've always hankered
for something on the water.

58:20.220 --> 58:22.220
What is this floor?

58:29.520 --> 58:31.610
It took God seven days...

58:31.780 --> 58:33.940
...to create Paradise.

58:34.440 --> 58:37.160
Let's see if I can do better.

58:43.620 --> 58:45.620
Good babies.

58:46.080 --> 58:47.170
Grow for mommy.

58:53.170 --> 58:54.670
Bane, darling...

58:54.880 --> 58:58.260
...I found a fellow
who strikes my fancy.

58:58.470 --> 59:00.640
A cool customer, yes.

59:01.720 --> 59:03.640
Icy demeanor...

59:04.180 --> 59:05.730
...no question.

59:06.560 --> 59:10.270
But I detect a certain ruthless charm
I may be able to use...

59:10.480 --> 59:12.400
...to my advantage.

59:13.280 --> 59:15.860
Honey, clean up this mess.

59:16.030 --> 59:18.030
We've got company coming.

59:18.860 --> 59:19.820
Honey.

59:20.490 --> 59:21.660
Company.

59:35.050 --> 59:38.510
We've been going out
for over a year now, and...

59:39.840 --> 59:41.140
Okay, here it goes.

59:41.350 --> 59:43.680
I want to spend my life with you.

59:46.850 --> 59:48.690
I'm not the marrying kind.

59:48.850 --> 59:51.770
There are things about me
you wouldn't understand.

59:52.310 --> 59:55.070
I know you're a dedicated bachelor.

59:55.280 --> 59:56.780
You've had your wild nights.

59:57.440 --> 59:58.950
"Wild" doesn't...

59:59.780 --> 01:00:01.240
...quite cover it.

01:00:02.870 --> 01:00:05.330
You'll make someone
a good husband one day...

01:00:05.700 --> 01:00:07.080
...but I can't wait forever.

01:00:12.290 --> 01:00:15.050
Look, I don't want to pressure you.
Because if I do...

01:00:15.210 --> 01:00:17.260
...you'll just shut down.

01:00:17.710 --> 01:00:19.260
I know the way you are.

01:00:20.880 --> 01:00:22.640
Think about it.

01:00:22.890 --> 01:00:25.060
Just promise me you'll think about it.

01:00:25.970 --> 01:00:26.810
Okay?

01:00:28.350 --> 01:00:30.100
You don't have to answer now.

01:00:30.480 --> 01:00:31.560
Just...

01:00:31.730 --> 01:00:33.060
...think it over.

01:00:33.270 --> 01:00:35.110
Here's food for thought.

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:55.210
Who's Ivy?

01:00:57.550 --> 01:00:59.340
You just called me "Ivy."

01:00:59.590 --> 01:01:00.920
Who's Ivy?

01:01:02.130 --> 01:01:03.510
I wish I knew.

01:01:05.680 --> 01:01:08.100
Enhance detail, 14 to 19.

01:01:13.310 --> 01:01:15.020
Who are you?

01:01:28.950 --> 01:01:30.160
Gotcha!

01:02:18.170 --> 01:02:19.840
Banker, how much coin to play?

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:21.130
21/2.

01:02:21.300 --> 01:02:24.220
You're the chick who won
the tunnel run 2 nights ago!

01:02:24.420 --> 01:02:25.470
That'd be me.

01:02:25.680 --> 01:02:28.010
That was kid stuff, sweetheart.

01:02:28.260 --> 01:02:31.140
Why don't you take your tricycle
and run home?

01:02:32.180 --> 01:02:33.930
- Want a side bet?
- How much?

01:02:34.140 --> 01:02:35.850
- How much you got?
- How much you got?

01:02:36.020 --> 01:02:39.270
All right, let's race! Come on!

01:02:47.200 --> 01:02:50.530
Just make sure the guys are ready
at the end of the bridge.

01:02:51.700 --> 01:02:53.040
You got it, Spike!

01:04:02.400 --> 01:04:04.270
Out of my way, losers!

01:04:05.570 --> 01:04:06.820
Nice try, girlie!

01:04:07.030 --> 01:04:08.280
You're next!

01:04:10.320 --> 01:04:11.780
Excuse me!

01:04:15.370 --> 01:04:16.870
Look out, baby!

01:04:35.850 --> 01:04:38.060
Not bad, for a chick!

01:05:11.430 --> 01:05:12.380
Now!

01:05:26.860 --> 01:05:28.400
End of the line, sweetheart!

01:05:54.890 --> 01:05:56.470
So this is where you hang out.

01:06:01.060 --> 01:06:02.310
How long you been racing?

01:06:02.480 --> 01:06:04.520
Since my parents died.

01:06:04.690 --> 01:06:08.690
I guess all the speed and danger
helped take me out of myself.

01:06:08.900 --> 01:06:10.650
Made the pain go away.

01:06:11.230 --> 01:06:12.860
You wouldn't understand.

01:06:13.070 --> 01:06:14.530
You'd be surprised.

01:06:14.910 --> 01:06:19.530
Street racing isn't exactly
an acceptable major at Oxbridge so...

01:06:19.700 --> 01:06:21.200
...they kicked me out.

01:06:21.450 --> 01:06:25.120
But I've already won the money I need
to do what I've always dreamed.

01:06:25.330 --> 01:06:27.420
Don't say you want to join the circus.

01:06:28.420 --> 01:06:32.510
Alfred has supported me my whole life
and I'm going to pay him back.

01:06:33.380 --> 01:06:36.090
I'll take him away
from this dismal life of servitude.

01:06:36.890 --> 01:06:38.390
What are you talking about?

01:06:38.550 --> 01:06:41.350
Listen, this whole
master-servant thing...

01:06:41.520 --> 01:06:42.930
...it's really ridiculous.

01:06:43.140 --> 01:06:45.390
Alfred is a sweet, noble man...

01:06:45.560 --> 01:06:49.110
...and he's subjugated all his life
and dreams to someone else.

01:06:49.310 --> 01:06:51.270
Alfred and Bruce are like family.

01:06:52.400 --> 01:06:54.570
Paying someone to prepare your meals...

01:06:54.740 --> 01:06:57.660
...do laundry, clean dishes,
you call that family?

01:06:57.910 --> 01:06:59.280
Alfred's happy.

01:06:59.570 --> 01:07:00.950
Happy?

01:07:01.620 --> 01:07:04.000
You honestly don't know, do you?

01:07:04.200 --> 01:07:06.710
How he's hiding the pain all the time.

01:07:07.460 --> 01:07:08.790
Alfred's sick.

01:07:12.380 --> 01:07:14.300
Alfred's not sick.

01:07:14.590 --> 01:07:15.970
He's dying.

01:07:18.680 --> 01:07:19.890
Dying?

01:07:23.270 --> 01:07:24.770
Why didn't he tell us?

01:07:25.310 --> 01:07:28.020
You know Alfred,
he'd never say anything.

01:07:34.280 --> 01:07:35.610
But I can tell.

01:07:40.570 --> 01:07:42.410
I can't believe it.

01:07:43.790 --> 01:07:44.790
I know.

01:08:33.500 --> 01:08:35.250
Icehead, you got a visitor.

01:08:35.800 --> 01:08:38.220
Your sister is here to see you.

01:08:38.380 --> 01:08:39.630
Sister?

01:08:43.760 --> 01:08:45.680
Brother, dear...

01:08:46.350 --> 01:08:48.560
...I heard you were blue.

01:08:50.850 --> 01:08:53.229
Don't mind us, ma'am.

01:08:53.399 --> 01:08:55.399
You can speak freely.

01:08:58.069 --> 01:09:00.569
I don't mind you at all.

01:09:04.529 --> 01:09:05.779
Men...

01:09:06.120 --> 01:09:08.870
...the most absurd of God's creatures.

01:09:09.080 --> 01:09:10.410
We give you life...

01:09:11.080 --> 01:09:14.500
...and we can take it away
just as easily.

01:09:14.670 --> 01:09:16.920
- Right!
- Whatever.

01:09:18.300 --> 01:09:20.840
I really am to die for.

01:09:48.700 --> 01:09:50.290
Impressive!

01:09:51.460 --> 01:09:54.710
Well, I, my most
unabominable snowman...

01:09:55.290 --> 01:09:57.670
...have been impressed by you.

01:09:57.880 --> 01:09:59.300
In fact...

01:09:59.460 --> 01:10:01.920
...I propose a pairing.

01:10:12.060 --> 01:10:14.140
I've come to set you free.

01:10:15.100 --> 01:10:16.940
An enticing offer...

01:10:17.610 --> 01:10:18.610
...but...

01:10:18.770 --> 01:10:20.940
...what does the lady want in return?

01:10:23.740 --> 01:10:27.160
Let's cool it for now.
I've got someone I want you to meet.

01:10:34.620 --> 01:10:36.920
His name is Bane.

01:10:37.500 --> 01:10:40.630
A laundry service that delivers! Wow!

01:10:45.630 --> 01:10:48.510
What are you,
about a 50, big and tall?

01:10:48.930 --> 01:10:52.810
No, I always go a size smaller.
Makes me look slimmer.

01:10:58.400 --> 01:10:59.900
I'm running on empty.

01:11:00.150 --> 01:11:01.650
I need the diamonds.

01:11:01.820 --> 01:11:03.990
I'll help you grab your rocks.

01:11:07.360 --> 01:11:08.450
Bane...

01:11:08.660 --> 01:11:09.910
...dear...

01:11:10.160 --> 01:11:11.700
...an exit, please.

01:11:17.540 --> 01:11:19.290
Reinforced steel.

01:11:19.500 --> 01:11:20.630
Not good.

01:11:31.510 --> 01:11:33.850
Always winterize your pipes.

01:11:49.990 --> 01:11:53.950
While I get my diamonds,
you and "meatloaf" retrieve my wife.

01:11:54.200 --> 01:11:56.250
You never mentioned a wife!

01:11:56.410 --> 01:11:57.410
Come on.

01:11:57.580 --> 01:11:59.500
I hope Mr. Bane can swim.

01:12:17.930 --> 01:12:19.940
Alfred, are you well?

01:12:20.270 --> 01:12:22.770
As well as can be expected, sir.

01:12:24.900 --> 01:12:26.440
My friend, I know you're sick.

01:12:26.650 --> 01:12:28.450
I can get you the best doctors.

01:12:28.650 --> 01:12:31.320
I have seen the best doctors.

01:12:31.780 --> 01:12:36.450
A gentleman does not discuss
his ailments. It is not civilized.

01:12:36.910 --> 01:12:41.120
I hope that I have taught you
at least that much, Master Bruce.

01:12:44.500 --> 01:12:45.920
Have you ever...

01:12:46.130 --> 01:12:48.630
...regretted your life working here?

01:12:49.470 --> 01:12:50.880
Looking after heroes?

01:12:51.090 --> 01:12:52.390
No, sir.

01:12:53.350 --> 01:12:57.470
My only regret is that I was never
able to be out there with you.

01:13:00.980 --> 01:13:03.400
Not all the heroes wear masks.

01:13:07.610 --> 01:13:08.860
Freeze has escaped!

01:13:22.670 --> 01:13:25.250
We got this off
the Arkham surveillance camera.

01:13:28.510 --> 01:13:29.840
Poison Ivy.

01:13:31.510 --> 01:13:32.510
2 nights ago...

01:13:32.760 --> 01:13:36.760
...Gotham Airport, these two arrive
by charter from South America.

01:13:37.140 --> 01:13:40.100
They put 10 security guards
in the hospital...

01:13:40.350 --> 01:13:44.860
...left a businessman dead from
organic poisoning, stole his limousine.

01:13:45.060 --> 01:13:48.360
This is definitely the same pair
that sprang Freeze.

01:13:49.570 --> 01:13:50.990
Excuse me, gentlemen.

01:13:51.900 --> 01:13:54.360
Poison Ivy...
why would she help Freeze?

01:13:54.570 --> 01:13:56.120
She's definitely evil.

01:13:56.370 --> 01:13:59.120
She was all I could think about,
like I was in love...

01:13:59.370 --> 01:14:01.500
I know, then the feeling vanished.

01:14:01.710 --> 01:14:04.000
I can't believe
we fought over a bad guy.

01:14:04.210 --> 01:14:06.540
Bad, yes. Guy, no.

01:14:06.750 --> 01:14:08.500
Well, I'm totally over her.

01:14:08.710 --> 01:14:10.420
Me too. Definitely.

01:14:11.380 --> 01:14:13.550
- Great stems, though.
- Buds too.

01:14:13.720 --> 01:14:14.720
Those are nice.

01:14:14.890 --> 01:14:16.010
Here we go.

01:14:22.180 --> 01:14:23.350
It's Nora Fries.

01:14:23.560 --> 01:14:24.900
She's still alive.

01:14:40.910 --> 01:14:43.750
He adapted his freezing technology
to reverse the disease.

01:14:43.910 --> 01:14:46.580
He found a cure for the disease
in some stages.

01:14:47.580 --> 01:14:48.590
There she is.

01:14:49.880 --> 01:14:52.210
Get the diamonds.
I'll rescue the bride.

01:14:52.460 --> 01:14:54.590
We'll meet back at my place.

01:14:55.430 --> 01:14:58.760
In my weakened condition,
I'm no match for the Bat and Bird.

01:14:58.930 --> 01:15:01.470
You leave those boys to me.

01:15:01.930 --> 01:15:02.930
Go!

01:15:05.480 --> 01:15:08.190
- Can he save her?
- Her case is too advanced.

01:15:08.440 --> 01:15:09.770
But maybe someday...

01:15:09.940 --> 01:15:11.610
...with more research...

01:15:18.070 --> 01:15:19.450
Poison Ivy.

01:15:29.580 --> 01:15:31.710
I hate uninvited guests.

01:15:38.930 --> 01:15:40.510
My lungs are freezing!

01:15:53.440 --> 01:15:54.440
Chilled...

01:15:54.650 --> 01:15:55.820
...to perfection.

01:16:03.040 --> 01:16:04.040
No beauty.

01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:08.540
Just the beast.

01:16:28.520 --> 01:16:30.560
Hey, there, pretty birdie.

01:16:30.770 --> 01:16:32.690
Give yourself up. If you surrender...

01:16:32.900 --> 01:16:34.020
To you?

01:16:36.030 --> 01:16:38.030
Polly want a kiss?

01:16:50.370 --> 01:16:54.750
There's something about
an anatomically correct...

01:16:54.960 --> 01:16:59.050
...rubber suit
that puts fire in a girl's lips.

01:17:02.390 --> 01:17:05.890
Why are all the gorgeous ones
homicidal maniacs? Is it me?

01:17:06.060 --> 01:17:07.020
Enough...

01:17:07.180 --> 01:17:08.810
...sweet talk.

01:17:11.730 --> 01:17:15.070
First you'll tell me where Freeze is,
then you're going to jail.

01:17:19.360 --> 01:17:20.860
I'm a lover, not a fighter.

01:17:21.070 --> 01:17:24.410
That's why every Poison Ivy
Action Figure comes with him!

01:17:27.910 --> 01:17:30.790
Try not to make a mess when you die.

01:18:01.780 --> 01:18:02.950
Hold it right there!

01:18:24.630 --> 01:18:25.970
Stop!

01:18:28.260 --> 01:18:31.930
Living in the shadow
of the big, bad Bat.

01:18:32.140 --> 01:18:34.020
You don't need him.

01:18:34.810 --> 01:18:36.940
You're the star.

01:18:37.150 --> 01:18:38.940
I can see it now:

01:18:39.150 --> 01:18:43.320
Your own big, bright signal in the sky.

01:18:44.150 --> 01:18:46.160
Let me guide you.

01:18:54.830 --> 01:18:56.670
Let me kiss you.

01:18:56.830 --> 01:18:58.340
Stop! Don't kiss her.

01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:01.840
The victim at the airport,
toxins introduced orally.

01:19:02.050 --> 01:19:04.680
- What are you saying?
- Why does she want to kiss us?

01:19:04.880 --> 01:19:07.260
- I bet her lips are poisoned.
- Poisoned kiss?

01:19:07.470 --> 01:19:08.850
You have issues with women!

01:19:09.050 --> 01:19:11.470
You can't stand that
she'd kiss me and not you.

01:19:11.720 --> 01:19:13.850
Something would be mine, not yours.

01:19:24.320 --> 01:19:25.400
Exit, Bane.

01:19:25.820 --> 01:19:27.320
Exit!

01:19:38.420 --> 01:19:40.880
Ivy's right. I don't need your help.

01:19:43.210 --> 01:19:44.880
I'm going solo!

01:19:47.510 --> 01:19:48.640
What happened?

01:19:48.840 --> 01:19:50.510
How'd they get away?

01:20:07.950 --> 01:20:10.910
I've never been good with competition.

01:20:12.950 --> 01:20:16.080
Who needs a frigid wife anyway?

01:20:41.100 --> 01:20:42.980
Make yourself right at home.

01:20:45.400 --> 01:20:46.610
Where's my wife?

01:20:47.070 --> 01:20:50.110
There was nothing I could do.
Batman deactivated her.

01:20:50.570 --> 01:20:52.780
- She's dead.
- You lie!

01:21:17.600 --> 01:21:19.180
I'm sorry.

01:21:21.440 --> 01:21:24.360
Their bones will turn to ice!

01:21:26.480 --> 01:21:29.190
Their blood will freeze in my hands!

01:21:30.030 --> 01:21:31.410
Kill them, of course.

01:21:31.610 --> 01:21:33.490
But why stop there?

01:21:34.160 --> 01:21:36.950
Why should only
Batman and Robin die...

01:21:37.160 --> 01:21:40.540
...while the society that created them
goes unpunished?

01:21:40.790 --> 01:21:42.460
Yes!

01:21:42.670 --> 01:21:44.840
If I must suffer...

01:21:45.040 --> 01:21:47.960
...humanity will suffer with me!

01:21:48.170 --> 01:21:53.050
I shall repay them for sentencing me
to a life without human comfort.

01:21:53.640 --> 01:21:57.060
I will blanket the city
in endless winter!

01:21:57.350 --> 01:21:58.520
First...

01:22:00.020 --> 01:22:01.230
...Gotham.

01:22:02.350 --> 01:22:03.900
And then...

01:22:04.350 --> 01:22:05.480
...the world!

01:22:05.900 --> 01:22:08.690
Just what I had in mind.

01:22:09.990 --> 01:22:13.160
Everything dead on Earth except us.

01:22:13.360 --> 01:22:14.870
A chance for...

01:22:15.070 --> 01:22:17.910
...Mother Nature to start again.

01:22:18.240 --> 01:22:19.160
Behold...

01:22:19.370 --> 01:22:22.080
...the dawn of a new age.

01:22:25.540 --> 01:22:28.710
My mutant plants have the strength
of the deadliest animals.

01:22:29.550 --> 01:22:33.930
Once you have frozen mankind,
these babies will overrun the globe.

01:22:34.930 --> 01:22:36.720
And we shall rule them.

01:22:38.390 --> 01:22:39.890
For we will be...

01:22:40.100 --> 01:22:42.680
...the only two people
left in the world.

01:22:43.520 --> 01:22:45.230
Yes.

01:22:45.560 --> 01:22:46.900
Adam...

01:22:48.400 --> 01:22:49.690
...and Evil.

01:22:51.400 --> 01:22:53.360
You distract the Bat and Bird...

01:22:53.530 --> 01:22:55.070
...while I prepare...

01:22:55.280 --> 01:22:56.620
...to freeze...

01:22:56.870 --> 01:22:58.280
...Gotham!

01:23:12.710 --> 01:23:15.880
It's Stage 1 of Macgregor's Syndrome.

01:23:16.430 --> 01:23:17.550
I'm sorry.

01:23:18.680 --> 01:23:21.520
All we can do is
make him comfortable.

01:23:24.060 --> 01:23:25.390
Thank you, Doctor.

01:23:42.700 --> 01:23:45.290
Macgregor's Syndrome is
what Fries' wife had.

01:23:45.830 --> 01:23:48.460
Alfred's condition is less severe.
Fries' research said...

01:23:48.710 --> 01:23:51.130
...he cured a case like it,
just didn't say how.

01:23:51.340 --> 01:23:53.210
No one else is even close.

01:23:53.420 --> 01:23:57.050
I'm late for the dedication,
then I go after Freeze and Ivy alone.

01:23:57.260 --> 01:23:59.510
- Like hell you do.
- Don't push me right now.

01:23:59.720 --> 01:24:02.970
Or what? No one can
capture Ivy but the big, bad Bat?

01:24:03.180 --> 01:24:03.930
Right.

01:24:04.470 --> 01:24:05.980
You want her for yourself.

01:24:06.180 --> 01:24:09.810
I want her so badly, I can taste it.
That's the whole point.

01:24:10.650 --> 01:24:15.070
She's done something to us.
She has us fighting over her somehow.

01:24:15.280 --> 01:24:18.700
I know she loves me and not you,
and it's driving you crazy.

01:24:18.950 --> 01:24:21.330
That's why you
stopped us from kissing.

01:24:21.490 --> 01:24:24.200
- You're not thinking straight.
- But I am.

01:24:25.290 --> 01:24:27.210
For the first time in a long time.

01:24:27.460 --> 01:24:29.920
I want a Robin signal
in the sky, all right?

01:24:30.130 --> 01:24:32.090
I'm tired of living
in your shadow.

01:24:32.290 --> 01:24:33.500
All that ends now.

01:24:38.590 --> 01:24:40.390
I'm sorry, Uncle.

01:24:41.680 --> 01:24:43.390
I was too late.

01:24:54.230 --> 01:24:56.940
You must do something for me.

01:24:59.070 --> 01:25:01.030
Find my brother, Wilfred...

01:25:01.240 --> 01:25:03.740
...your uncle,
wherever he is, and give him...

01:25:03.990 --> 01:25:05.040
...this.

01:25:05.240 --> 01:25:09.040
I have duties
that he must fulfill in my stead.

01:25:10.420 --> 01:25:12.880
Only family can be trusted.

01:25:13.790 --> 01:25:15.000
What is it?

01:25:15.550 --> 01:25:18.970
It is a sacred trust of two good men...

01:25:19.170 --> 01:25:22.260
...whom I have the honor
of calling "son."

01:25:25.180 --> 01:25:26.470
Take it to Wilfred...

01:25:26.640 --> 01:25:28.270
...and I implore you...

01:25:29.180 --> 01:25:30.640
...never open it.

01:25:34.060 --> 01:25:37.110
You look so like your mother.

01:25:40.650 --> 01:25:43.450
<i>Bonsoir, glamorous Gothamites.</i>

01:25:43.660 --> 01:25:45.580
<i>Everyone who 's anyone...</i>

01:25:45.740 --> 01:25:47.490
...has flocked to the observatory...

01:25:47.660 --> 01:25:51.830
...and tonight's star-studded
dedication of the new telescope.

01:25:56.670 --> 01:26:00.130
And here's the man
of the hour himself...

01:26:00.380 --> 01:26:02.380
...Bruce Wayne.

01:26:05.550 --> 01:26:06.760
Excuse me.

01:26:09.600 --> 01:26:10.600
Commissioner.

01:26:10.770 --> 01:26:12.270
- How are you?
- Good. You know Julie?

01:26:12.480 --> 01:26:13.730
How are you?

01:26:13.940 --> 01:26:15.230
Good to see you.

01:26:17.610 --> 01:26:18.780
Young man.

01:26:20.570 --> 01:26:22.240
Lovely to see you again.

01:26:27.530 --> 01:26:28.700
Thank you.

01:26:29.330 --> 01:26:30.950
Commissioner Gordon...

01:26:33.500 --> 01:26:35.210
...I've always wondered...

01:26:35.420 --> 01:26:39.170
...where does that big,
old Batlight come from?

01:26:45.090 --> 01:26:46.470
Why...

01:26:46.640 --> 01:26:47.470
...it's...

01:26:47.640 --> 01:26:49.810
...on top of Police Headquarters.

01:26:50.720 --> 01:26:51.930
I'd just...

01:26:52.180 --> 01:26:53.770
...love to see it.

01:26:53.980 --> 01:26:56.480
But you probably don't have access.

01:26:56.650 --> 01:26:57.900
Why, dear lady...

01:26:58.980 --> 01:27:01.400
...I am the police commissioner.

01:27:01.610 --> 01:27:04.570
I have the keys
right here in my pocket.

01:27:04.740 --> 01:27:06.280
Would you like to see it?

01:27:24.840 --> 01:27:27.840
Who are you, dear lady?

01:27:30.680 --> 01:27:33.600
On second thought,
you're way too old for me.

01:27:33.770 --> 01:27:35.480
No, I'm not.

01:27:36.650 --> 01:27:38.110
Please...

01:27:38.310 --> 01:27:39.940
...come back.

01:27:46.660 --> 01:27:48.700
What are you doing? Come on.

01:27:49.490 --> 01:27:51.870
Show me how the satellites work.

01:28:05.340 --> 01:28:06.380
First...

01:28:06.590 --> 01:28:09.720
...I will turn Gotham into
an icy graveyard...

01:28:09.890 --> 01:28:10.760
...then...

01:28:10.970 --> 01:28:13.930
...I will pull Batman's heart
from his body...

01:28:14.180 --> 01:28:16.810
...and feel it freeze in my hands.

01:28:21.360 --> 01:28:22.270
Revenge!

01:28:23.730 --> 01:28:25.320
Quickly, Bane.

01:28:25.530 --> 01:28:26.740
Quickly now.

01:28:40.210 --> 01:28:42.290
Let there be light.

01:28:48.630 --> 01:28:51.010
Only family can be trusted?

01:28:53.970 --> 01:28:55.100
I'm family.

01:29:31.800 --> 01:29:34.890
I spend my entire life
trying to beat back death.

01:29:39.140 --> 01:29:41.650
Everything I've done,
everything I'm...

01:29:42.310 --> 01:29:44.310
...capable of doing...

01:29:47.780 --> 01:29:49.740
But I can't save you.

01:29:50.900 --> 01:29:53.910
There's no defeat in death...

01:29:54.160 --> 01:29:56.160
...Master Bruce.

01:29:57.620 --> 01:30:00.580
Victory comes in defending...

01:30:00.790 --> 01:30:03.000
...what we know is right...

01:30:03.460 --> 01:30:05.920
...while we still live.

01:30:35.160 --> 01:30:36.740
I love you, old man.

01:30:40.290 --> 01:30:43.080
And I love you too.

Margaret.

The combined power of
the telescope's reflecting crystals...

...will complete...

01:32:18.050 --> 01:32:19.760
...my freezing engine.

01:32:23.470 --> 01:32:26.270
No matter
what they tell you, Mr. Bane...

01:32:26.520 --> 01:32:29.150
...it is the size of
your gun that counts.

01:32:38.860 --> 01:32:39.910
Where are you going?

01:32:40.070 --> 01:32:43.040
It's not a Batlight, it's a Robin signal.
Ivy's calling me.

01:32:43.200 --> 01:32:44.410
Her name's Pamela Isley.

01:32:44.580 --> 01:32:47.410
She must've stolen Gordon's keys
and changed the signal.

01:32:47.580 --> 01:32:49.000
She did it for me, for love.

01:32:49.170 --> 01:32:51.040
She infected us with pheromones.

01:32:51.250 --> 01:32:53.590
I'm under some kind of magic spell?

01:32:53.800 --> 01:32:54.960
She wants to kill you.

01:32:55.260 --> 01:32:57.840
You'd say anything to keep her
away from me.

01:32:58.010 --> 01:32:59.590
To keep her for yourself.

01:33:00.090 --> 01:33:02.760
You said being a team
means trusting your partner.

01:33:02.970 --> 01:33:07.480
Sometimes, counting on someone
else is the only way to win. Remember?

01:33:08.020 --> 01:33:11.810
You weren't talking about partners,
but about being a family.

01:33:12.480 --> 01:33:13.940
So I'm asking you...

01:33:14.110 --> 01:33:15.780
...friend, partner...

01:33:16.030 --> 01:33:17.030
...brother...

01:33:18.030 --> 01:33:19.910
...will you trust me now?

01:33:32.290 --> 01:33:35.000
- All the crystals are in place.
- Thank you.

01:33:44.510 --> 01:33:45.760
Hi!

01:33:45.970 --> 01:33:47.810
I'm sorry about the door.

01:33:48.730 --> 01:33:49.980
Is the party over?

01:33:53.060 --> 01:33:54.980
Who is this nutball?

01:34:34.520 --> 01:34:36.150
If revenge...

01:34:36.360 --> 01:34:38.730
...is a dish best served cold...

01:34:39.190 --> 01:34:41.740
...then put on your Sunday finest.

01:34:42.280 --> 01:34:43.410
It's time...

01:34:43.740 --> 01:34:45.410
...to feast!

01:34:56.920 --> 01:34:58.090
Tonight...

01:34:58.380 --> 01:35:01.260
...hell freezes over.

01:35:40.670 --> 01:35:42.130
<i>Intruder alert.</i>

01:35:42.300 --> 01:35:43.470
<i>Intruder alert.</i>

01:35:45.800 --> 01:35:48.010
<i>Intruder alert. Identify.</i>

01:35:48.850 --> 01:35:51.310
Uncle Alfred, it's me. Barbara.

01:35:51.770 --> 01:35:54.690
<i>I expected you might find</i>
<i>your way down here, child.</i>

01:35:54.940 --> 01:35:57.310
<i>I programmed my brain algorithms...</i>

01:35:57.520 --> 01:35:59.020
<i>... into the Batcomputer...</i>

01:35:59.190 --> 01:36:02.730
<i>... and created a virtual simulation.</i>

01:36:03.030 --> 01:36:05.150
I'd like to help Batman and Robin.

01:36:05.320 --> 01:36:06.990
<i>I anticipated you would...</i>

01:36:07.200 --> 01:36:10.530
<i>... and took the liberty</i>
<i>to create something in your size.</i>

01:36:11.830 --> 01:36:13.950
Suit me up, Uncle Alfred.

01:37:34.830 --> 01:37:36.120
Hi there.

01:37:40.290 --> 01:37:43.000
Is your thumb the
only part of you that's green?

01:37:43.420 --> 01:37:46.300
You will just have to find out.

01:37:46.920 --> 01:37:48.800
I want us to be together, but...

01:37:48.970 --> 01:37:51.590
...you must be serious
about turning over a new leaf.

01:37:53.430 --> 01:37:54.300
I need a sign...

01:37:55.310 --> 01:37:57.430
How about "Slippery when wet."

01:37:57.600 --> 01:37:58.810
...of trust.

01:37:59.140 --> 01:38:00.730
Tell me your plan.

01:38:00.940 --> 01:38:02.440
Kiss me and I'll tell you.

01:38:03.400 --> 01:38:05.320
Tell me and I'll kiss you.

01:38:06.780 --> 01:38:11.530
Freeze has taken the new telescope
and turned it into a giant freezing gun.

01:38:11.860 --> 01:38:14.450
He's about to turn Gotham
into an ice cube.

01:38:15.780 --> 01:38:17.200
I've got to stop him.

01:38:17.370 --> 01:38:18.540
One kiss...

01:38:18.790 --> 01:38:19.830
...my love.

01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:22.420
For luck.

01:38:35.430 --> 01:38:37.260
Bad luck, I'm afraid.

01:38:38.100 --> 01:38:40.100
Time to die, little Robin.

01:38:43.310 --> 01:38:45.610
I hate to disappoint you, but...

01:38:49.650 --> 01:38:52.360
...rubber lips are immune to
your charms.

01:38:59.580 --> 01:39:00.870
See you!

01:39:02.830 --> 01:39:05.580
You're not the only one
who can set a trap, Venus.

01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:06.960
Sorry...

01:39:07.170 --> 01:39:09.800
...my vines have a crush on you.

01:39:17.640 --> 01:39:18.890
Got to go.

01:39:19.060 --> 01:39:22.520
So many people to kill,
so little time.

01:39:32.030 --> 01:39:33.700
You're about to become compost.

01:39:41.410 --> 01:39:44.080
Using feminine wiles
to get what you want?

01:39:44.250 --> 01:39:45.290
Trading on your looks?

01:39:45.460 --> 01:39:46.380
Read a book.

01:39:46.540 --> 01:39:49.000
That passive-aggressive
number went out long ago.

01:39:49.210 --> 01:39:51.250
You give women a bad name.

01:40:11.530 --> 01:40:15.400
As I told Lady Fries,
when I pulled her plug...

01:40:15.950 --> 01:40:17.660
...this is a one-woman show.

01:40:18.120 --> 01:40:19.450
I don't think so.

01:40:41.180 --> 01:40:42.220
Curses!

01:40:58.530 --> 01:41:00.160
Freeze is going to ice the city.

01:41:00.370 --> 01:41:01.530
I know.

01:41:01.740 --> 01:41:02.700
And you are?

01:41:02.950 --> 01:41:03.990
Batgirl.

01:41:04.200 --> 01:41:07.750
That's not P.C. What about
Batperson or Batwoman?

01:41:08.120 --> 01:41:11.420
Bruce, it's me, Barbara.
I found the Batcave.

01:41:11.630 --> 01:41:13.090
We must change the locks.

01:41:13.300 --> 01:41:15.460
- She knows who we are.
- We must kill her.

01:41:15.630 --> 01:41:17.970
Later. We have work to do.

01:41:37.190 --> 01:41:40.200
Let's kick some ice.

01:43:08.240 --> 01:43:10.500
We have 11 minutes
to thaw the city.

01:43:37.980 --> 01:43:39.150
Gotcha!

01:43:40.150 --> 01:43:41.150
Now!

01:43:50.790 --> 01:43:52.120
Shield.

01:44:14.140 --> 01:44:15.350
I'll finish off the city.

01:44:15.520 --> 01:44:17.810
You kill the kids, but...

01:44:17.980 --> 01:44:20.320
...leave me the Bat.

01:44:40.540 --> 01:44:41.840
No sign of the snowman.

01:44:42.590 --> 01:44:44.380
Maybe he melted.

01:44:44.590 --> 01:44:46.720
No, he's just hibernating.

01:45:04.570 --> 01:45:05.690
These heaters will thaw them.

01:45:13.740 --> 01:45:15.870
I hope you've got
10 million more of those toys.

01:45:16.250 --> 01:45:18.420
8 minutes
and they're ice cubes forever.

01:45:18.580 --> 01:45:20.250
Sunlight could reverse
the freezing process.

01:45:20.420 --> 01:45:21.880
Sunrise isn't for 5 hours.

01:45:22.040 --> 01:45:22.590
Here.

01:45:22.750 --> 01:45:24.170
It's morning in the Congo.

01:45:24.380 --> 01:45:25.420
We'll relay sunlight...

01:45:25.590 --> 01:45:26.840
From below the equator...

01:45:27.050 --> 01:45:29.720
It'll take the satellites
a minute to realign, but...

01:45:30.260 --> 01:45:30.890
Damn!

01:45:31.050 --> 01:45:32.640
Damn?
Damn's not good.

01:45:32.890 --> 01:45:35.520
Those targeting mirrors are frozen.

01:45:35.720 --> 01:45:37.270
I realign, you thaw the mirrors.

01:46:03.540 --> 01:46:04.960
Tonight's forecast:

01:46:05.210 --> 01:46:07.090
A freeze is coming.

01:46:21.440 --> 01:46:22.900
Bye-bye.

01:46:35.870 --> 01:46:37.120
I got you!

01:46:47.750 --> 01:46:49.840
No.
I got you.

01:47:02.850 --> 01:47:04.650
It's one of those days!

01:47:58.830 --> 01:48:00.410
Dirty fighter!

01:48:15.760 --> 01:48:16.760
The tube!

01:48:31.610 --> 01:48:32.530
Yay, Batman!

01:48:46.080 --> 01:48:47.670
Hey, Freeze.

01:48:47.870 --> 01:48:48.880
The heat is on.

01:49:02.220 --> 01:49:04.060
You all right down there?

01:49:05.640 --> 01:49:06.640
Here goes.

01:49:35.670 --> 01:49:36.840
Hang on.

01:49:52.730 --> 01:49:53.690
You're doing it!

01:49:54.780 --> 01:49:56.690
You've lost, Freeze.

01:49:57.240 --> 01:49:58.240
I think not.

01:49:59.610 --> 01:50:01.240
Bombs away, Batman.

01:50:25.640 --> 01:50:28.060
Freeze in hell, Batman!

01:50:56.040 --> 01:50:57.670
What should we do now?

01:50:57.880 --> 01:50:58.760
Pray.

01:51:04.590 --> 01:51:06.100
Hang on!

01:51:08.930 --> 01:51:10.850
Grab on to my belt!

01:51:29.540 --> 01:51:31.160
Thank you, Batman!

01:51:36.420 --> 01:51:37.420
Need a ride?

01:51:48.600 --> 01:51:51.100
- Most of Gotham's still frozen.
- It's midnight.

01:51:51.430 --> 01:51:54.060
Telescope's gone.
There's no way to thaw the city.

01:51:54.230 --> 01:51:57.270
The satellites could do it,
but it'd take a computer genius.

01:51:57.440 --> 01:51:58.440
I'm on it.

01:51:59.150 --> 01:52:00.400
No, I'm on it.

01:52:06.370 --> 01:52:07.780
Have to do it upside down.

01:52:07.990 --> 01:52:10.580
Men!
Everything the hard way.

01:52:13.160 --> 01:52:15.170
You're pretty good at this, little girl.

01:52:16.830 --> 01:52:19.290
Watch and learn, little boy.

01:53:26.280 --> 01:53:28.240
They say it'll be a beautiful day.

01:53:36.580 --> 01:53:39.580
I'm taking you back
to Arkham Asylum.

01:53:40.790 --> 01:53:42.250
Go on.

01:53:43.130 --> 01:53:44.460
Kill me too.

01:53:44.710 --> 01:53:46.300
Just as you killed my wife.

01:53:46.510 --> 01:53:48.130
I didn't kill your wife.

01:53:53.220 --> 01:53:57.230
<i>As I told Lady Fries</i>
<i>when I pulled her plug...</i>

01:53:57.520 --> 01:53:59.900
<i>... this is a one-woman show.</i>

01:54:05.610 --> 01:54:08.150
But she's not dead.

01:54:08.280 --> 01:54:10.240
We found her,
restored her.

01:54:10.780 --> 01:54:12.990
She's still frozen alive...

01:54:13.280 --> 01:54:15.080
...waiting for you to find a cure.

01:54:16.290 --> 01:54:18.040
She lives?

01:54:20.290 --> 01:54:23.630
But vengeance isn't power.
Anyone can take a life.

01:54:24.170 --> 01:54:25.800
But to give life...

01:54:26.250 --> 01:54:29.130
...that's true power.
A power you once had.

01:54:30.300 --> 01:54:32.180
She's alive.

01:54:37.850 --> 01:54:39.480
So I'm asking you.

01:54:40.480 --> 01:54:42.100
Victor Fries...

01:54:42.940 --> 01:54:44.860
...help me save another life.

01:54:45.270 --> 01:54:48.280
Show me how to cure
Macgregor's Syndrome Stage 1.

01:54:48.780 --> 01:54:52.570
And maybe you can also save the life
of the man your wife once loved.

01:54:53.490 --> 01:54:55.580
He's still inside you, Victor.

01:54:56.580 --> 01:54:57.660
Buried...

01:54:57.950 --> 01:55:00.040
...deep beneath the snow.

01:55:02.670 --> 01:55:04.330
Will you help me...

01:55:05.880 --> 01:55:06.500
...Doctor?

01:55:31.700 --> 01:55:33.700
Take 2 of these...

01:55:34.990 --> 01:55:36.910
...and call me in the morning.

01:55:47.460 --> 01:55:50.130
I'll have your wife
moved to the lab at Arkham.

01:55:50.340 --> 01:55:52.720
You'll be able to continue
your research there.

01:56:16.370 --> 01:56:18.530
All we can do now is wait...

01:56:19.370 --> 01:56:21.200
...and hope.

01:56:47.440 --> 01:56:49.270
He loves me.

01:56:50.770 --> 01:56:52.610
He loves me not.

01:56:54.950 --> 01:56:56.570
He loves me.

01:56:58.450 --> 01:56:59.570
Not!

01:57:01.450 --> 01:57:02.950
Surprise.

01:57:03.160 --> 01:57:05.160
I'm your new cellmate.

01:57:07.540 --> 01:57:10.750
And I've come
to make your life a living hell.

01:57:11.750 --> 01:57:12.710
Prepare...

01:57:12.960 --> 01:57:14.760
...for a bitter harvest.

01:57:18.470 --> 01:57:19.640
Winter...

01:57:19.970 --> 01:57:21.970
...has come at last.

01:58:07.600 --> 01:58:08.440
Are you...?

01:58:08.600 --> 01:58:13.400
Rather disappointed at how poorly
I have taught you proper housekeeping.

01:58:13.860 --> 01:58:15.690
And quite well, it seems!

01:58:16.150 --> 01:58:17.530
Thanks to you, son.

01:58:17.690 --> 01:58:19.950
Thanks to you all.

01:58:20.160 --> 01:58:21.740
Well done, Bruce.

01:58:22.120 --> 01:58:24.200
You too.
Well done.

01:58:25.540 --> 01:58:27.080
I got one question.

01:58:27.410 --> 01:58:31.120
When we fell off the telescope,
why didn't you try and save us?

01:58:31.330 --> 01:58:33.500
It's the first time I've fallen
and you weren't there.

01:58:34.170 --> 01:58:35.460
I figured you could handle it.

01:58:35.630 --> 01:58:40.340
You know, sometimes counting on
somebody else is the only way to win.

01:58:43.220 --> 01:58:44.050
Excuse me.

01:58:44.220 --> 01:58:46.680
I'm the one who
kicked Ivy's botanical butt.

01:58:46.850 --> 01:58:47.980
Yeah, that was me.

01:58:48.180 --> 01:58:49.520
I did it all by myself.

01:58:49.770 --> 01:58:50.730
That was me.

01:58:50.980 --> 01:58:53.230
You are going back to school.

01:58:53.440 --> 01:58:55.150
You'll never win this argument.

01:59:00.240 --> 01:59:01.410
Partners?

01:59:06.410 --> 01:59:07.240
Partners.

01:59:16.750 --> 01:59:18.550
Partners.

01:59:22.010 --> 01:59:24.090
We're going to need a bigger cave.
