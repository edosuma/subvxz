00:00.674 --> 00:02.589
[weatherman] <i>
Good morning, Big City!</i>

00:02.632 --> 00:05.853
<i>It seems we've awoken to
a surprise overnight snowfall!</i>

00:05.896 --> 00:07.855
<i>Folks all across town
are taking it in</i>

00:07.898 --> 00:09.552
<i>before it melts later tonight.</i>

00:09.596 --> 00:12.076
I'm Ronald Featherman,
your local weatherman,

00:12.120 --> 00:15.036
here to get the word
from one of our very own.

00:15.079 --> 00:17.821
You! Little boy, what do you
think of this surprise snow?

00:17.865 --> 00:19.954
[unintelligible chatter]

00:19.997 --> 00:22.434
Powerful words
from a powerful baby.

00:22.478 --> 00:23.827
[kids laughing]

00:23.871 --> 00:25.916
[pants, grunts]

00:25.960 --> 00:28.789
Wow, way to take a hit, buddy!

00:28.832 --> 00:31.574
So, you ready to play again
for the fourteenth time?!

00:31.618 --> 00:35.012
We could, or we could play
together! On the same team!

00:35.056 --> 00:38.189
Great idea! With your
high school level reading brain

00:38.233 --> 00:40.061
and my one really strong arm,

00:40.104 --> 00:42.454
we'd be the best
snowball fighting duo ever!

00:42.498 --> 00:44.587
We just need someone else
to play against.

00:44.631 --> 00:47.721
Let me go see if I can teach
the robot butler how to fight.

00:47.764 --> 00:49.200
Ah! [gasps]

00:49.244 --> 00:51.115
Vasquez! You saved me!

00:51.159 --> 00:52.856
You're the best bodyguard, ever.

00:52.900 --> 00:55.467
It's my duty to protect you,
Master Remy.

00:55.511 --> 00:57.208
[gasps] That's it! Vasquez!

00:57.252 --> 00:59.036
You should snowball fight
me and Remy!

00:59.080 --> 01:01.648
- No.
- That's a great idea, Cricket!

01:01.691 --> 01:03.563
Vasquez, you must play with us!

01:03.606 --> 01:04.955
- No.
- [Cricket] Nyeh!

01:04.999 --> 01:07.262
Fight with us!

01:07.305 --> 01:09.656
I cannot. I am
Master Remy's bodyguard.

01:09.699 --> 01:12.746
To harm him in any way, even
with the gentlest snowball,

01:12.789 --> 01:14.574
would violate
my prime directive.

01:14.617 --> 01:16.880
Uh-huh, uh-huh.
Remy, may I have a word?

01:16.924 --> 01:19.361
- Okay.
- I know how to get Vasquez

01:19.404 --> 01:21.276
to play with us.

01:21.319 --> 01:23.147
[clears throat]

01:23.191 --> 01:24.758
As long as he's your bodyguard,

01:24.801 --> 01:26.542
he's gotta guard
your little body, right?

01:26.586 --> 01:28.979
- Mm-hmm.
- So, fire him!

01:29.023 --> 01:30.546
- What?!
- Shh-shh-shh!

01:30.590 --> 01:32.635
Fire him temporarily.

01:32.679 --> 01:34.942
Just long enough for him
to snowball fight us!

01:34.985 --> 01:36.639
Then you hire him back, m-kay?

01:36.683 --> 01:38.336
That makes so much sense!

01:38.380 --> 01:39.618
I'll go tell him the good news!

01:39.642 --> 01:40.774
You do that, buddy.

01:40.817 --> 01:43.167
Vasquez! Vasquez! You're fired!

01:43.211 --> 01:46.693
Wh-wha...?
[wails in agony]

01:46.736 --> 01:49.957
[wailing]

01:50.000 --> 01:51.959
[sobbing]

01:52.002 --> 01:54.004
Vasquez, it's okay!

01:54.048 --> 01:56.311
I'll hire you back right after
you snowball fight us!

01:56.354 --> 01:58.095
- If you give us a good game!
- Yeah!

01:58.139 --> 02:02.012
Give us a good game! And
don't hold back, ya hear me?

02:02.056 --> 02:04.972
Yes, Master Remy.
I hear you perfectly.

02:05.015 --> 02:06.626
[both]
Yay!

02:06.669 --> 02:08.018
You have a ten second
head start.

02:08.062 --> 02:09.890
[both giggling]

02:09.933 --> 02:12.632
It's two against one!
We're gonna obliterate him!

02:12.675 --> 02:14.721
[boys sing song]
La, la, la, la, la!

02:14.764 --> 02:17.332
If Master Remy
requires a good game,

02:17.375 --> 02:20.378
then I shall give him
a good game.

02:21.989 --> 02:23.991
We've been unexpectedly seasoned

02:24.034 --> 02:26.863
with nature's wintry salt.
Isn't it wonderful?

02:26.907 --> 02:28.604
Sure is, Tilly-girl!

02:28.648 --> 02:31.433
Just adding
the finishing touch... There.

02:31.476 --> 02:33.957
Lookin' good, Till.
Whaddya gonna name her?

02:34.001 --> 02:35.959
[Tilly]
Her name is Margaret.

02:36.003 --> 02:37.004
I like it!

02:37.047 --> 02:38.614
I made a whole to-do list
for her.

02:38.658 --> 02:40.616
Get made out of snow.
Melt.

02:40.660 --> 02:42.400
The end.

02:42.444 --> 02:44.794
What? What about
all the stuff in between?

02:44.838 --> 02:46.970
Time moves swiftly
for a snow person.

02:47.014 --> 02:49.016
She's a banana.
Green on the table,

02:49.059 --> 02:51.627
but browning in the hand. Time.

02:51.671 --> 02:54.456
Whoa. No, no-no-no.
Man, that is bleak.

02:54.499 --> 02:56.284
There's so much
she'll miss out on!

02:56.327 --> 02:58.199
Oh! She's dripping.

02:58.242 --> 03:00.505
Tilly, if this is the one day
of Margaret's life,

03:00.549 --> 03:03.030
then we gotta fill it up!
Make it rich!

03:03.073 --> 03:05.728
- I suppose.
- Here, give me that list.

03:05.772 --> 03:09.471
We are gonna give her
the best last first day, ever.

03:09.514 --> 03:10.907
Let's go!

03:10.951 --> 03:12.517
Ho-kay!

03:12.561 --> 03:14.998
-Pack it once, twice,
-[snow squeaking]

03:15.042 --> 03:18.088
thrice, and there!
We are ready for him.

03:18.132 --> 03:21.004
All right, Remy, keep
a keen eye out for Vasquez.

03:21.048 --> 03:22.745
[rustling]

03:22.789 --> 03:24.747
[both]
Shh-shh-shh!

03:24.791 --> 03:27.010
Huh, I guess it was noth...

03:27.054 --> 03:28.664
Ah! Ugh!

03:28.708 --> 03:29.883
Cricket! Are you okay?

03:29.926 --> 03:33.234
[panting]
He's... here.

03:33.277 --> 03:35.845
Vasquez? Where...
Ah!

03:35.889 --> 03:37.978
[screaming, crying]

03:38.021 --> 03:39.893
- Remy, cover your vitals!
- I can't!

03:39.936 --> 03:41.808
I have too many vitals!

03:41.851 --> 03:44.898
It's getting in my un-do's,
Cricket! My un-do's!

03:44.941 --> 03:46.813
Okay, hold on, buddy.
I got an idea!

03:46.856 --> 03:48.423
Ow ow ow ow!

03:48.466 --> 03:50.338
Vasquez, time out!

03:50.381 --> 03:51.469
[silence]

03:53.558 --> 03:55.647
[chuckles] Got him.

03:55.691 --> 03:56.910
Cricket, there he is!

03:56.953 --> 03:59.129
Ha! We fooled you, Vasquez!

03:59.173 --> 04:00.565
[clatters]

04:00.609 --> 04:01.871
[both gasp]

04:04.221 --> 04:05.788
Gramma?!

04:05.832 --> 04:06.876
Idiots!

04:06.920 --> 04:09.226
[whimpers]
Then, where is he?

04:09.270 --> 04:10.575
Here.

04:10.619 --> 04:12.403
[gradually rising yell]

04:15.189 --> 04:17.060
[crunches]

04:17.104 --> 04:18.932
[yell continues to scream]

04:18.975 --> 04:20.150
Run!

04:20.194 --> 04:22.892
Hey, Joe Snow!
What about Gramma!

04:24.111 --> 04:25.677
Everyone staying warm in here?

04:25.721 --> 04:27.505
Hey, Bill, can we
get a hand here?

04:27.549 --> 04:29.856
- This is Margaret.
- Uh, hi, Margaret.

04:29.899 --> 04:32.336
We're trying to give her
a full life before she...

04:32.380 --> 04:33.947
[whispers]
Melts.

04:33.990 --> 04:35.862
And first up on
the list of experiences

04:35.905 --> 04:38.386
is falling in love.
You gotta kiss her.

04:38.429 --> 04:40.867
- [Tilly squeals]
- Makes perfect sense.

04:40.910 --> 04:43.783
Margaret, I love you.
[kisses]

04:43.826 --> 04:46.002
[Nancy]
Aw, sweet.

04:46.046 --> 04:47.830
- Okay, next!
- [paper rustles]

04:47.874 --> 04:49.136
Oh, shoot.

04:49.179 --> 04:51.268
Hey, Bill, we need you
to dump Margaret.

04:52.443 --> 04:54.619
I'm sorry, Margaret,

04:54.663 --> 04:56.534
but I think we should
see other people.

04:56.578 --> 04:58.754
[both wailing]

04:58.798 --> 05:02.627
- Oh, no, Bill. Come on!
- Too cruel, Papa! Too cruel!

05:02.671 --> 05:04.629
There are
plenty more fish in the sea.

05:04.673 --> 05:06.240
[dryly]
Trust me, I know.

05:06.283 --> 05:08.677
- [crying]
- Let's get moving!

05:08.720 --> 05:11.027
What about eating
cartons of ice cream

05:11.071 --> 05:12.724
and burning Papa's belongings?

05:12.768 --> 05:14.944
[Nancy] No time!
Margaret's starting to soften.

05:14.988 --> 05:18.165
Done-zo.
Up next, the zoo!

05:18.208 --> 05:19.862
Who's ready
to see some polar bears?

05:19.906 --> 05:21.821
- We are!
- Polar bear show

05:21.864 --> 05:24.693
- starts in five minutes!
- Well, that was fun!

05:24.736 --> 05:26.564
Huh?
But what about the polar...

05:26.608 --> 05:28.479
They're bears, they're white.
Margaret gets it.

05:28.523 --> 05:30.438
Time is short and
we got a lot to do!

05:30.481 --> 05:32.614
<i>Next up, the skate park.</i>

05:32.657 --> 05:34.050
Margaret's doin' an ollie!

05:35.835 --> 05:37.575
Whoo! Good enough.

05:37.619 --> 05:39.882
<i>Margret's first movie!</i>

05:39.926 --> 05:42.363
[movie preview] <i>Coming soon,
to a theater near you...</i>

05:42.406 --> 05:45.018
Okay, that's enough, we gotta
keep hoofin' on this list.

05:45.061 --> 05:47.585
Hmph. What
is goin' on with her?

05:47.629 --> 05:50.197
[Remy] Cricket,
we've been running for hours!

05:50.240 --> 05:52.025
Can't we stop
to catch our breath?

05:52.068 --> 05:54.810
Yeah, sure.
We've put enough distance

05:54.854 --> 05:58.248
between us and Vasquez.
Let's just... [groans]

05:58.292 --> 06:00.294
Lie down for a second?

06:00.337 --> 06:03.297
Ho, man, you hear that?
My heart is pounding.

06:03.340 --> 06:06.213
- [whupping]
- Yeah, mine, too.

06:09.651 --> 06:11.348
Oh, my gosh! Remy, run!

06:12.828 --> 06:14.874
[both screaming]

06:14.917 --> 06:16.919
[computer voice] <i>
Auto pilot, engaged.</i>

06:16.963 --> 06:18.355
[grunts]

06:19.356 --> 06:20.923
- Snow-zooka.
- [beeps]

06:20.967 --> 06:22.446
[scream]

06:22.490 --> 06:23.839
[boys]
Ah!

06:25.536 --> 06:27.582
Uh, excuse me.

06:27.625 --> 06:30.454
Vasquez! You're rehired!
Please stop!

06:30.498 --> 06:32.543
You hear that, man?
Remy wants you back!

06:32.587 --> 06:34.110
Everything can just
go back to normal!

06:34.154 --> 06:35.982
Can't you see? It's us!

06:37.766 --> 06:39.768
Vasquez, can't you hear us?!

06:39.811 --> 06:41.944
Vasquez squash bugs.

06:41.988 --> 06:43.641
He's too far gone!

06:43.685 --> 06:46.731
We've created a monster!

06:46.775 --> 06:47.863
Hello, Vasquez!

06:47.907 --> 06:49.821
- Ah!
- Uh...

06:49.865 --> 06:51.736
Really?! We're walking, here!

06:51.780 --> 06:53.347
Oh, wow, I said the thing.

06:53.390 --> 06:54.870
You are not who I seek!

06:54.914 --> 06:57.046
And you're not
the large pizza I ordered

06:57.090 --> 07:00.223
for my snow person friend.
So, if you'll excuse us.

07:00.267 --> 07:01.964
How's she liking her coffee,
Till?

07:02.008 --> 07:04.358
I'm afraid Margaret
is beginning to sluice.

07:04.401 --> 07:06.838
- Bye, Vasquez!
- [Vasquez growls]

07:06.882 --> 07:08.666
What do we do now?

07:08.710 --> 07:11.974
The only way to stop Vasquez
is to win this snowball fight.

07:12.018 --> 07:13.976
Okay, we still
got a lot more to do.

07:14.020 --> 07:15.978
How's Margaret's pizza party
wrapping up?

07:16.022 --> 07:17.675
We're working on the last slice.

07:17.719 --> 07:19.155
[squelches]

07:19.199 --> 07:21.375
Mama, I'm not sure
she's gonna last much...

07:21.418 --> 07:24.987
Ugh! [strains, groans]

07:25.031 --> 07:27.076
Mama, this is
getting out of hand.

07:27.120 --> 07:28.991
Hey, there you are!
Next on her list is...

07:29.035 --> 07:31.951
[straining]
mechanical bull riding!

07:31.994 --> 07:33.909
Then, we'll get gelato,
go rock climbing...

07:33.953 --> 07:35.606
Mama, are you all right?

07:35.650 --> 07:37.347
One sec.
Then, we'll have a concert,

07:37.391 --> 07:40.133
I'll do lead vocals and
you can be on tambourine.

07:40.176 --> 07:41.656
- Mama...
- And then,

07:41.699 --> 07:42.831
we can sign her up for tap!

07:42.874 --> 07:44.746
[bull roars]

07:44.789 --> 07:46.139
- [gasps]
- [splats]

07:46.182 --> 07:48.880
Ah! That's okay! She's okay!

07:48.924 --> 07:51.013
We're just gonna squish
the snow back together

07:51.057 --> 07:52.928
and Margret will be okay
and we can move on

07:52.972 --> 07:54.340
to the next thing
on the list and...

07:54.364 --> 07:55.844
May I have a word with you?

07:55.887 --> 07:57.367
[bartender]
Skim milk, on the rocks.

07:57.411 --> 07:59.891
Ah, just the way I like it.

07:59.935 --> 08:02.111
Mama, I know it's difficult
to see Margaret

08:02.155 --> 08:05.332
- in such an unseemly state.
- [dripping]

08:05.375 --> 08:07.508
But snow persons melt
all the time.

08:07.551 --> 08:10.076
I suspect something else
is plaguing you.

08:10.119 --> 08:11.816
Well now, look at you.

08:11.860 --> 08:14.906
You're already talkin'
so grownup-ly! [chuckles]

08:14.950 --> 08:17.822
[sighs] I guess, seeing
Margaret's life go by so fast

08:17.866 --> 08:20.086
made me think of you,
and all the time

08:20.129 --> 08:21.870
I missed with you
when I was in jail.

08:21.913 --> 08:24.916
And all the time I miss
when I'm <i>not</i> with you.

08:24.960 --> 08:26.918
You're just growin' up so fast.

08:26.962 --> 08:29.617
- [slurps]
- [laughs]

08:29.660 --> 08:32.054
Well, I guess,
you're still a kid, after all.

08:32.098 --> 08:35.014
Mama, what's important is
enjoying the time

08:35.057 --> 08:36.711
we have together, right now.

08:36.754 --> 08:38.582
Margaret's life
may be just a day,

08:38.626 --> 08:41.890
but we still have a whole
lifetime to spend together.

08:41.933 --> 08:44.023
Oh, sweetie, I love you.

08:44.066 --> 08:45.937
I'm so sorry
I made all the stuff

08:45.981 --> 08:47.678
with Margaret rushed and weird.

08:47.722 --> 08:49.854
I just really did not
want to see her melt.

08:49.898 --> 08:52.118
Well, maybe,
she doesn't have to.

08:55.904 --> 08:58.037
Best snow day, ever!

09:01.040 --> 09:03.955
So, they've returned
to the nest.

09:03.999 --> 09:07.089
[computer beeping]

09:07.133 --> 09:08.656
Target found.

09:08.699 --> 09:10.527
[splats]

09:10.571 --> 09:12.051
- Wha...
- Idiot!

09:12.094 --> 09:13.617
Language!

09:13.661 --> 09:15.184
But that means... Ooh!

09:15.228 --> 09:17.186
[teeth chattering]
We t-t-took off our clothes

09:17.230 --> 09:19.493
and hid in the snow to lower
our c-core temperature

09:19.536 --> 09:21.277
so you couldn't see us!

09:21.321 --> 09:23.975
B-because we're s-s-smart!

09:24.019 --> 09:26.108
And now, you're finished!

09:26.152 --> 09:28.806
Huh? Ah!

09:28.850 --> 09:31.418
[both]
Whoo-hoo! Yeah!

09:31.461 --> 09:33.855
It's finally over. We won.

09:33.898 --> 09:36.466
Uh-oh. Ah! Remy!

09:37.467 --> 09:38.773
Cricket!

09:39.774 --> 09:42.168
- Yah!
- Run! [muffled]

09:42.211 --> 09:43.908
Vasquez, stop!

09:43.952 --> 09:45.693
Vasquez squash bugs!

09:45.736 --> 09:48.304
Fine! If I can't win,

09:48.348 --> 09:51.394
- I'll lose!
- Huh?

09:51.438 --> 09:53.527
If this is what it takes
to end this,

09:53.570 --> 09:56.356
do it! Let's finish this!
[grunting]

09:56.399 --> 09:57.835
Huh? What?

09:57.879 --> 09:59.272
I asked for a good game,

09:59.315 --> 10:02.362
now gimme a good game!
C'mon, right here!

10:02.405 --> 10:06.279
[groaning]
Vasquez squash bug!

10:06.322 --> 10:10.196
Vasquez squash... M-Master Remy?

10:10.239 --> 10:11.632
- Oh!

10:11.675 --> 10:13.764
Master Remy! What have I done?

10:13.808 --> 10:15.853
Vasquez, you're back!

10:15.897 --> 10:18.291
Can you ever forgive me?

10:18.334 --> 10:20.162
Already done! Vasquez,

10:20.206 --> 10:21.859
will you be my bodyguard again?

10:21.903 --> 10:24.775
Yes, yes, a thousand times, yes!

10:24.819 --> 10:26.995
Wow, love conquers all.

10:27.038 --> 10:28.953
Huh? Hey,

10:28.997 --> 10:31.782

your Gramma as bait!
