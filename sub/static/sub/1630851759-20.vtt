opened this place,

19:36.926 --> 19:38.219
Um, actually, I

19:38.219 --> 19:40.388
had to have my dad
cancel the order.

19:40.805 --> 19:41.889
I'm sorry, Lex.

19:43.224 --> 19:44.016
Wait,

19:44.433 --> 19:45.267
what happened?

19:45.267 --> 19:46.602
Well, I tried to make the pie,

19:46.602 --> 19:48.396
but it was terrible.

19:50.064 --> 19:52.274
I shouldn't have assumed
that I could handle it.

19:52.983 --> 19:54.485
I needed my mom to teach me,

19:54.485 --> 19:55.611
like...

19:55.611 --> 19:56.862
your mom taught you.

19:56.862 --> 19:58.072
What do you mean?

19:58.364 --> 20:00.533
‐My mom didn't teach me.
‐She didn't?

20:00.533 --> 20:02.952
No. My Uncle Mike
taught me at Thanksgiving

20:02.952 --> 20:04.662
while my mom
was makin' turkey.

20:04.662 --> 20:06.205
But I thought the whole
tradition was that

20:06.205 --> 20:08.791
moms passed down the pie
to their daughters.

20:08.791 --> 20:11.085
No. The tradition is that

20:11.085 --> 20:13.546
the family recipe
is taught by family.

20:14.213 --> 20:17.258
And I'm your family,
so now I'm teaching you.

20:17.258 --> 20:18.175
