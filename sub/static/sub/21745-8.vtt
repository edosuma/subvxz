ANNOUNCER:
American Horror Story: Cult.

00:08.776 --> 00:10.711
All new,
Tuesdays at 10:00 on FX.

00:13.081 --> 00:16.750
FXX presents You're the Worst.

00:19.620 --> 00:20.654
LINDSAY: And then, even after
I showed them my true colors,

00:20.688 --> 00:21.655
Cyndi Lauper-style,

00:21.689 --> 00:23.057
my coworkers ditched me.

00:23.091 --> 00:25.359
Triflin'-ass Vogue readers.

00:25.393 --> 00:28.096
Mm! I almost forgot.

00:28.129 --> 00:30.931
I made you a friendship bracelet
when I was home.

00:30.964 --> 00:32.433
Aw!

00:32.466 --> 00:34.268
"G plus H"?

00:34.302 --> 00:35.403
The "H" stands
for "Hot Lindsay."

00:35.436 --> 00:37.671
See? I'm friendable!

00:37.705 --> 00:40.007
I know they're triflin', Gretch,
but I really want

00:40.040 --> 00:43.010
those multicultural
fashion lizards to like me.

00:43.043 --> 00:44.345
They're my work family.

00:44.378 --> 00:45.946
No, I get it.

00:45.979 --> 00:48.282
My old boss Rick was
my work family until his head

00:48.316 --> 00:51.119
got cut off
in that Jet Ski accident.

00:51.152 --> 00:54.222
(gasps, gasping operatically)

00:54.255 --> 00:56.857
It's my divorce license.
(panting)

00:56.890 --> 00:58.726
Ha! I'm divorced!

00:58.759 --> 01:01.895
Oh, no. I broke my divorce.

01:01.929 --> 01:03.531
Yay! Paul is dead!

01:03.564 --> 01:05.199
(laughs)

01:05.233 --> 01:07.368
Now we can be fun single ladies
together!

01:07.401 --> 01:09.603
Ha. Uh, yeah.

01:09.637 --> 01:11.772
Since when does being
a fun single lady mean

01:11.805 --> 01:13.941
boning the same old-ass dad
every night?

01:13.974 --> 01:15.042
Just admit it.

01:15.075 --> 01:17.077
You're down a road.

01:17.111 --> 01:18.979
We are not down a road.

01:19.012 --> 01:20.481
Then don't hang out with him
tonight.

01:20.514 --> 01:21.482
Fine!

01:21.515 --> 01:23.484
Easy. Not a problem.

01:23.517 --> 01:25.253
I will just tell that fool...

01:25.286 --> 01:28.055
that I am very sick
so he doesn't get mad at me.

01:28.088 --> 01:30.424
You... have... a... boyfriend!

01:30.458 --> 01:32.493
Don't emoji clap at me.

01:32.526 --> 01:34.094
Okay, how 'bout this?

01:34.128 --> 01:37.398
To celebrate our new singlehood,

01:37.431 --> 01:39.600
I will throw you a divorce party
tonight. No Boone.

01:39.633 --> 01:41.935
Yes! And I can invite
my work fam.

01:41.969 --> 01:44.338
Maybe once they know
I'm a cool-ass divorcÃ©e

01:44.372 --> 01:46.840
like ScarJo
or Nicole Brown Simpson,

01:46.874 --> 01:49.410
Jeff and Tara will want
to be friends with me.

01:49.443 --> 01:50.911
Perfect.

01:50.944 --> 01:52.413
Ow!

01:52.446 --> 01:54.582
I really need
to stop buying window drugs

01:54.615 --> 01:56.817
from that homeless guy.

01:56.850 --> 01:58.552
*

02:01.622 --> 02:04.792
* I'm gonna leave you anyway

02:04.825 --> 02:06.960
* I'm gonna leave you
anyway *

02:06.994 --> 02:09.297
* Gonna leave you anyway.

02:15.503 --> 02:17.905

Jimmy Shive-Overly.

02:35.989 --> 02:40.361
Now, make sure to wear
your VIP badge at all times.

02:40.394 --> 02:41.462
I absolutely will not.

02:41.495 --> 02:43.364
Congrats on the release
of your book.

02:43.397 --> 02:45.566
I hear it's very steamy.

02:45.599 --> 02:48.902
It's also a Dickensian
exploration of the long shadow

02:48.936 --> 02:51.405
cast on British progeniture
by the Second World War,

02:51.439 --> 02:53.040
but thank you.

02:53.073 --> 02:54.642
Hot.

02:54.675 --> 02:56.176
*

03:05.052 --> 03:07.255
There we go.
Getting that weekly tighten-up,

03:07.288 --> 03:10.424
-quaffing that rye hattie.
-You're right.

03:10.458 --> 03:14.595
Co-grooming can be a bonding
yet totally macho ritual.

03:14.628 --> 03:15.663
(phones chime, buzz)

03:15.696 --> 03:17.665
Oh...

03:17.698 --> 03:19.333
(both gasp)

03:19.367 --> 03:21.101
-SneakerSeeker!
-SneakerSeeker!

03:21.134 --> 03:26.874
Oh, shit, the Yeezy 350 Pirate
Blacks are on sale for $950!

03:26.907 --> 03:27.941
And purchased!

03:27.975 --> 03:30.043
You, too.

03:30.077 --> 03:31.912
-We got to be twinsies.
-Nine hundo?

03:31.945 --> 03:34.615
Uh, gee, I-I don't know. I...

03:35.916 --> 03:37.418
And...

03:37.451 --> 03:39.387
-done.
-Yes!

03:39.420 --> 03:42.523
Where's the foreign dude
with the weird-colored dick?

03:42.556 --> 03:45.025
-Jimmy's on a work trip.
-Nice! Now we don't have to rip

03:45.058 --> 03:47.261
down his list of dum-dum rules
for the party.

03:47.295 --> 03:50.731
Going number two in the upstairs
bathroom all night, sucka.

03:50.764 --> 03:53.401
-What party?
-Ugh, I got super baked

03:53.434 --> 03:56.136
and offered to throw Lindser
a divorce party.

03:56.169 --> 03:57.004
Hmm.

04:01.942 --> 04:04.111
Edgar,
you should plan the party.

04:04.144 --> 04:05.779
-Why me?
-You're the foodie

04:05.813 --> 04:08.215
with the fancy-ass threads,
getting a house haircut,

04:08.248 --> 04:11.285
drinking a rye hattie
like Dan Goddamn Bilzerian!

04:11.319 --> 04:15.055
I guess
I could pull something together.

04:15.088 --> 04:18.792
Great. Remember, the theme is
Your Previously Secure Future

04:18.826 --> 04:20.961
is Suddenly
a Giant, Scary Question Mark.

04:20.994 --> 04:23.297
But fun!

04:23.331 --> 04:24.798
EDGAR:
Shoot.

04:24.832 --> 04:27.468
I-I guess I have to go
to the grocery store

04:27.501 --> 04:28.902
and the liquor store.
I should probably pick up

04:28.936 --> 04:30.304
some bubble wrap
for Lindsay to play with...

04:30.338 --> 04:31.972
Hey, relax.

04:32.005 --> 04:34.908
I know a party planner
who can take care of everything.

04:34.942 --> 04:37.911
He did Brent's going away,
and it was spectunckular.

04:37.945 --> 04:39.112
I got this.

04:39.146 --> 04:40.514
Wow, thanks.

04:40.548 --> 04:43.250
I mean,
that's-that's so generous.

04:43.283 --> 04:44.518
-(sent message chime)
-Wait,

04:44.552 --> 04:46.487
Brent moved?

04:46.520 --> 04:48.656
-Mm-hmm.
-Isn't he your main dude?

04:48.689 --> 04:51.492
Brent moved to Boulder
to work on his new app, Snoober.

04:51.525 --> 04:53.327
It's like Uber but for snow.

04:53.361 --> 04:55.829
So, the app helps you find
a place to ski

04:55.863 --> 04:58.499
-or makes snow or...
-Right!

04:58.532 --> 05:00.468
It's like Venmo,
but for mountains.

05:00.501 --> 05:02.636
Ah.

05:02.670 --> 05:05.172

05:11.044 --> 05:11.912

05:14.915 --> 05:20.153
* I come from a greener place
and a lawless past *

05:20.187 --> 05:22.556
* I was raised
with the cows and the birds *

05:22.590 --> 05:24.992
* And a toothless laugh...

05:25.025 --> 05:27.194
FAN: I loved
how Simon was drunk all the time

05:27.227 --> 05:29.196
when he was teaching drama
at that boarding school,

05:29.229 --> 05:33.000
because... I had sex
with my drama teacher, too.

05:33.033 --> 05:34.702
Who didn't?

05:34.735 --> 05:36.303
-(sobbing)
-(chuckling): Aw.

05:36.336 --> 05:38.372
You're so sweet.

05:39.607 --> 05:41.241
Smile.

05:41.274 --> 05:43.076

by YUNGBLUD playing)

05:43.110 --> 05:44.512
Who's next?

05:44.545 --> 05:46.046
ADRIENNE:
What's your name?

05:46.079 --> 05:48.882
*

05:48.916 --> 05:52.386
* I admit, I've never been broke
but I have been broken *

05:52.420 --> 05:54.422
* Shout inside,
she'll switch you for a token *

05:54.455 --> 05:57.758
-* Oh...
-* Of kindness

05:57.791 --> 05:58.992
* This one's for you,
King Charles *

05:59.026 --> 06:00.394
* You mess with the people

06:00.428 --> 06:02.563
* Took the taxes
to fund the evil *

06:02.596 --> 06:06.600
-* Ooh...
-* Sound familiar?

06:06.634 --> 06:08.569
* Don't mind us, divide us

06:08.602 --> 06:10.404
* But when we need guidance,
you give us the silence *

06:10.438 --> 06:12.406
* It's spineless and blindless

06:12.440 --> 06:14.708
* We will buy back,
not sit here smiling *

06:14.742 --> 06:17.711
-(hip-hop air horn sound effect)
-Wow.

06:17.745 --> 06:19.547
Thanks for doing all this.

06:19.580 --> 06:21.281
Hey, it's what buds do.

06:21.314 --> 06:24.117
Plus, you got to honor
the end of a relationship.

06:24.151 --> 06:25.886
When my pops and stepmom split,

06:25.919 --> 06:28.388
me and Dad bro'd out in
the Maldives for, like, a month.

06:28.422 --> 06:30.724
(chuckles)
Had too much Prosecco one night,

06:30.758 --> 06:32.125
and things got a little weird.

06:32.159 --> 06:34.127
But, all in all, great trip.

06:34.161 --> 06:37.064
-BECCA: Hello!
-Welcome to the party I planned!

06:37.097 --> 06:40.233
Oh, shit, it's Nerd
with his face X'ed out!

06:40.267 --> 06:41.902
So disrespected!

06:41.935 --> 06:44.304
Wow, Gretchen.

06:44.337 --> 06:47.641
How... Pinterest of you.

06:47.675 --> 06:50.143
You know, if we threw a party
every time Lindsay failed

06:50.177 --> 06:51.979
at something,
we'd be drunk all the time.

06:52.012 --> 06:54.815
Bitch, we are drunk
all the time. (chuckles)

06:54.848 --> 06:56.484
Because you keep pressuring me.

06:56.517 --> 06:58.318
Makes me wonder
what you're up to, mister.

06:58.351 --> 07:00.320
(grunts)

07:00.353 --> 07:02.923

07:07.360 --> 07:10.330
I'm here!

07:10.363 --> 07:13.601
Aw, thanks for comin', sis!

07:13.634 --> 07:17.237
Yeah, well, I find the whole
thing to be in very poor taste.

07:17.270 --> 07:18.639
Marriage is supposed
to be forever.

07:18.672 --> 07:20.073
(chuckles)
And you chose Vernon.

07:20.107 --> 07:21.642
Babe, can you take a pic for me?

07:21.675 --> 07:23.477
I want to get one
where I'm resting my dick

07:23.511 --> 07:25.078
-on his shoulder like a parrot.

Congratulations!

07:29.950 --> 07:33.420
Uh, a-and/or, uh,
my, uh, condolences,

07:33.453 --> 07:35.322
depending on your feelings
about the divorce.

07:35.355 --> 07:37.257
-Thank you so much
for inviting me. -Shut up.

07:37.290 --> 07:39.493
-Where are the good ones?
-The good...

07:39.527 --> 07:42.095
Oh, you mean Jeff and Tara.

07:42.129 --> 07:43.697
I'm not sure.

07:43.731 --> 07:45.733
Well, find out.

07:52.072 --> 07:53.641
*

07:53.674 --> 07:55.408
(sighs)

08:01.815 --> 08:02.916
(indistinct chatter)

08:11.358 --> 08:13.326
Let me guess.

08:13.360 --> 08:16.329
You're bummed because your work
is suddenly included

08:16.363 --> 08:20.367
in the mortifying anti-art
hellscape that is genre.

08:20.400 --> 08:24.304
Yeah. Well, Michael Chabon
isn't hyping Moonglow

08:24.337 --> 08:26.473
at the Gilroy Garlic Festival.

08:26.506 --> 08:27.975
He would if they invited him.

08:28.008 --> 08:30.377
He's not above helping sales,

08:30.410 --> 08:32.212
and neither should you be.

08:32.245 --> 08:34.848
Plus, not to be gross,

08:34.882 --> 08:37.651
but you could really clean up
around here.

08:37.685 --> 08:40.320
-What? -I'm just saying,
I'm an old married lady,

08:40.353 --> 08:43.356
but if I were
a hot, single British dude?

08:43.390 --> 08:45.092
Whew, boy,

08:45.125 --> 08:47.695
you'd have to take my dick home
in a body bag.

08:47.728 --> 08:48.896
(scoffs)

08:48.929 --> 08:50.330
Thanks.

08:50.363 --> 08:51.932
I think.

08:53.100 --> 08:54.735
Night, Jimmy.

08:56.770 --> 09:01.008
Try to have some fun
this weekend, will ya?

09:01.041 --> 09:02.109
* Run it

09:03.310 --> 09:04.612
* Run it

09:04.645 --> 09:06.446
* Wob-wob wobbin,
wob-wob wobbin *

09:06.479 --> 09:07.948
-* When I come around
-Mmm.

09:07.981 --> 09:09.683
* Got the whole thing
wobbin... *

09:09.717 --> 09:11.952
I can't believe none
of my work friends showed up.

09:11.985 --> 09:15.455
Not even the janitor guy
with the gross, black thumbnail.

09:15.488 --> 09:16.957
What about him?

09:16.990 --> 09:18.792
Carl? He doesn't count.

09:18.826 --> 09:21.695
Carl's basically
a human participation trophy.

09:21.729 --> 09:24.397
* Looking for the movie love,
they think I'm famous... *

09:24.431 --> 09:26.900
The most tragic part
of your sister's divorce

09:26.934 --> 09:29.870
is that she's wearing
that hideous dress

09:29.903 --> 09:31.438
a second time.

09:31.471 --> 09:32.940
(laughing)

09:34.474 --> 09:36.744
Ooh. Speaking
of dumb things I hate,

09:36.777 --> 09:39.046
Vernon tried to have sex
with me last night.

09:39.079 --> 09:41.715
I made him go jerk off
in the downstairs bathroom,

09:41.749 --> 09:44.618
because sometimes...
he touches his own nipples.

09:44.652 --> 09:46.219
It's revolting.

09:46.253 --> 09:48.889
That is so gay.

09:48.922 --> 09:50.758
(laughing)

09:50.791 --> 09:52.760
* They said, "Be real"

09:52.793 --> 09:55.295
* Nash jumping, I ain't even
had my leap year yet... *

09:55.328 --> 09:57.097
Well, I'm gonna take a lap.

09:57.130 --> 09:59.032
(doorbell rings,
knocking on door)

10:03.637 --> 10:06.273
So, I'm guessing
you're not sick.

10:06.306 --> 10:08.275
Actually, it's bananas.

10:08.308 --> 10:11.845
I was feeling straight garbaggio
when my friend

10:11.879 --> 10:14.081
basically blackmailed me
into hosting her divorce party.

10:14.114 --> 10:16.116
And when I was picking up
some wine,

10:16.149 --> 10:18.351
I gave this homeless woman
the last of my Chipotle,

10:18.385 --> 10:21.188
and she blessed me, and I was,
like, instantly cured!

10:21.221 --> 10:23.757
Oh. This is disappointing.

10:23.791 --> 10:26.927
Have fun being
a weird liar, I guess.

10:26.960 --> 10:28.662
Wait. I'm sorry.

10:28.696 --> 10:32.265
It's just you, me... road.

10:32.299 --> 10:34.601
We're heading down one,
right, it seems,

10:34.634 --> 10:37.838
and yeah, so... that.

10:38.872 --> 10:40.640
Scared.

10:40.674 --> 10:42.375
Me.

10:42.409 --> 10:44.277
You think we're down a road?

10:44.311 --> 10:45.879
I'm at your house
almost every night.

10:45.913 --> 10:47.715
Pretty soon you're gonna want me
to meet your kid.

10:47.748 --> 10:50.183
No. No, I won't.

10:50.217 --> 10:52.452
In fact, Olivia's actually
in the car right now reading,

10:52.485 --> 10:54.054
and you're
still not meeting her.

10:54.087 --> 10:55.355
(chuckles):
Really?

10:55.388 --> 10:57.825
Wait. You saying
I can't meet her?

10:57.858 --> 10:59.659
(laughs):
Like you'd want to.

10:59.693 --> 11:02.229
I mean, you have to admit you're
not exactly the "kid type."

11:04.698 --> 11:06.366
(sighs)

11:06.399 --> 11:08.635
I guess you can still have this.

11:08.668 --> 11:11.471
Hey, you want to come in
for one drink?

11:11.504 --> 11:15.242
-Uh... -Everybody's raving
about the Mezcalimonies.

11:16.276 --> 11:17.677
I guess.

11:17.711 --> 11:20.313
Plus, I'm very curious to see

11:20.347 --> 11:22.449
-who'd actually
be friends with you. -Oh.

11:23.951 --> 11:27.320
(hip-hop playing)

11:27.354 --> 11:28.889
Mmm.

11:28.922 --> 11:30.557
*

11:30.590 --> 11:32.425
Oh. Mmm.

11:32.459 --> 11:36.864
Hey. Bartender just told me they
ran out of 12-year Glenlivet.

11:36.897 --> 11:38.265
-Mm.
-So I'm thinking

11:38.298 --> 11:40.267
we take this party up a notch
and go 18?

11:40.300 --> 11:42.535
Oh, yeah! Let's do it!

11:42.569 --> 11:45.372
Great. 'Cause I like my scotch
like I like my women:

11:45.405 --> 11:47.074
of legal consenting age.

11:47.107 --> 11:49.409
-(laughing)
-Yeah.

11:49.442 --> 11:52.612
You used to treat women
really badly, huh?

11:52.645 --> 11:55.248
I really did.

11:55.282 --> 11:57.918
(groans softly)

11:57.951 --> 11:59.686
-(electronic chiming)
-I'm about to give my speech.

11:59.719 --> 12:01.054
Where is everyone?

12:01.088 --> 12:02.655
-Um...
-(chiming)

12:04.792 --> 12:06.093
*

12:11.899 --> 12:13.700
(object tapping glass)

12:13.733 --> 12:15.602
Hello?

12:15.635 --> 12:18.038
-Attention?
-(music stops)

12:18.071 --> 12:21.274
Sisters are supposed to give
speeches at these things, right?

12:21.308 --> 12:24.111
Well, I guess that's true
at weddings.

12:24.144 --> 12:27.080
Hard to believe Lindsay's was
only four short years ago.

12:27.114 --> 12:30.984
Lindsay, is there anything in
your life you haven't aborted?

12:31.018 --> 12:32.052
(people gasp)

12:32.085 --> 12:33.553
But seriously, guys...

12:33.586 --> 12:36.356
-(snickering)
-Lindsay... is my sister.

12:38.992 --> 12:41.028
Eh, that's all I got. Linds?

12:43.630 --> 12:45.665
(takes deep breath)

12:45.698 --> 12:49.136
*

12:49.169 --> 12:51.939
(object tapping glass)

12:54.341 --> 12:57.777
"I used to be in a bad marriage

12:57.811 --> 12:59.980
"to a very bad man.

13:01.014 --> 13:03.150
"But now...

13:03.183 --> 13:04.751
I'm free."

13:04.784 --> 13:06.086
-Yeah!

(laughter stops)

Hi. I'm Paul...

to those I don't know.

-WOMAN: Hi.
-Hi. Hi there.

13:33.546 --> 13:35.015
Hello.

(rock music playing,
lively chatter)

13:44.824 --> 13:45.825
Hi.

(whooping, cheering)

13:55.602 --> 13:57.737
"Simon loathed his new post

"at the New Hampshire
boarding school.

-"But oh, did he approve
of American girls, -Ooh.

the female drama students..."

Oh, my God.

14:23.730 --> 14:25.265
Okay.

14:29.302 --> 14:31.071
(Adrienne chuckles)

14:38.745 --> 14:40.747
WOMEN:
Ooh...

14:46.319 --> 14:49.156
(clapping, whooping)

14:53.326 --> 14:54.394
Who invited you?

14:54.427 --> 14:56.196
Your blisteringly dumb husband

14:56.229 --> 14:59.532
has been texting me photos
of this vile event all night.

14:59.566 --> 15:00.934
Shut up, narc.

15:02.169 --> 15:05.172
An X over my face, is it?

15:07.007 --> 15:09.542
Lo, the hypocrisy
of the cheater

15:09.576 --> 15:11.945
celebrating her freedom.

15:14.948 --> 15:16.916
Well, you're free, all right.

15:16.950 --> 15:20.653
Free from having me to blame
for your myriad problems.

15:20.687 --> 15:23.123
-Uh...
-"Myriad" means a lot.

15:23.156 --> 15:24.457
(laughing loudly)

15:24.491 --> 15:26.159
You always held me back.

15:26.193 --> 15:27.961
No wonder I can't swim.

15:27.995 --> 15:30.297
-No wonder I don't have a
middle name. -You can no longer

15:30.330 --> 15:33.266
blame me for your life,
because I'm not in it.

15:33.300 --> 15:35.902
You'll only have yourself
to blame when you

15:35.935 --> 15:37.304
lose your toys down the tub,

15:37.337 --> 15:39.306
or when you bite
into a chess piece

15:39.339 --> 15:41.341
because you think
it's white chocolate.

15:41.374 --> 15:42.575
I hate you!

15:42.609 --> 15:44.077
(Paul barking)

15:44.111 --> 15:46.413
-(laughing)
-Vernon?

15:46.446 --> 15:48.348
Drive us home.

15:48.381 --> 15:50.683
Okay, but you're not both
sitting in the back this time.

15:50.717 --> 15:53.320
-Shut up. Yes, we are.
-(Becca laughing)

15:53.353 --> 15:55.788
And... we're gonna sing duets

15:55.822 --> 15:57.490
until you...

15:57.524 --> 15:59.792
-* Drive the car
-* The car

15:59.826 --> 16:02.329
* Into the

16:02.362 --> 16:04.631
-* Ocean
* Sea... ocean

16:04.664 --> 16:06.299
* Vernon...

16:09.136 --> 16:10.570
(Vernon groans)

16:19.579 --> 16:21.614
What are you doing?

16:21.648 --> 16:23.616
-There you are.
-No.

16:23.650 --> 16:26.519
After we talked, I was looking
on Nextdoor, and I realized

16:26.553 --> 16:28.955
Silver Lake Heights
is highly dangerous.

16:28.988 --> 16:31.724
Someone's Amazon package
got stolen

16:31.758 --> 16:32.859
from right off
their front porch.

16:32.892 --> 16:34.494
Apparently, two high school kids

16:34.527 --> 16:36.196
were smoking
(whispering): pot

16:36.229 --> 16:38.298
in a car. Coyotes.

16:38.331 --> 16:41.201
Someone smashed Marisa Tomei's
jack-o-lantern.

16:41.234 --> 16:42.302
Plus, I thought Olivia
might want some cake.

16:42.335 --> 16:44.337
(whistles)

16:45.772 --> 16:47.374
It's all on Nextdoor.

16:47.407 --> 16:48.541
Come on, sweetie.

16:48.575 --> 16:50.009
Let's find you some milk.

16:51.444 --> 16:54.081
(moaning)

16:54.114 --> 16:55.715
(grunting)

17:04.757 --> 17:07.394
(Adrienne gasping)

17:09.729 --> 17:12.265
(Adrienne grunts and groans)

17:12.299 --> 17:14.301
(screams)

17:16.203 --> 17:17.570
Oh, no.

17:19.239 --> 17:22.041
-(coughing): Oh, my God.
-(Jimmy laughs)

17:22.075 --> 17:23.376
(grunts)

17:23.410 --> 17:24.911
(Adrienne retches)

17:24.944 --> 17:27.614
(coughing, retching)

17:28.615 --> 17:30.049
Oh, God.

17:30.083 --> 17:31.951
-Oh, no.
-Oh.

17:36.623 --> 17:39.259
Hey. Isn't it time for you
to catch a bouquet

17:39.292 --> 17:41.361
or put a garter back on
or something?

17:41.394 --> 17:43.796
Paul said I blame everybody else
for my life.

17:45.332 --> 17:46.766
Is everything my fault?

17:46.799 --> 17:48.635
Because I don't do life good?

17:48.668 --> 17:49.936
No, of course not.

17:49.969 --> 17:51.471
So it's your fault?

17:51.504 --> 17:53.473
No, sweetie.

17:53.506 --> 17:56.876
Then whose fault is it?

17:56.909 --> 17:58.878
(Gretchen sighs)

17:58.911 --> 18:01.414
One thing I learned in therapy
is that stuff

18:01.448 --> 18:03.049
that happens to you
when you're a kid

18:03.082 --> 18:05.618
can really screw you up
as an adult.

18:05.652 --> 18:08.121
Like, don't even get me started
how my parents let me watch

18:08.155 --> 18:10.290
Return to Oz every day.

18:10.323 --> 18:13.493
Wheelers, dude.

18:13.526 --> 18:15.228
I love you.

18:15.262 --> 18:18.265
I love you, too.

18:24.103 --> 18:27.440
Stuff that happened
when I was a kid?

18:27.474 --> 18:29.642
Becca.

18:32.379 --> 18:34.414
-Great party, bud.
-Mm-hmm.

18:34.447 --> 18:37.484
Here. My guy says it's time
to settle up.

18:42.121 --> 18:45.692
-$6,000?
-Wait. Seriously?

18:45.725 --> 18:48.195
-They hooked you up.
-Yeah.

18:48.228 --> 18:49.362
You got to tip huge.

18:49.396 --> 18:51.631
Me? Wait.

18:51.664 --> 18:54.133
I thought you were paying
for everything.

18:54.167 --> 18:56.703
(scoffs) Edgar, why would I pay
for your friend's party?

18:58.137 --> 19:01.674
I don't... I...

19:01.708 --> 19:03.543
I've never spent
this much money before.

19:03.576 --> 19:05.545
I just spent a thousand dollars

19:05.578 --> 19:07.647
on sneakers designed
by Kanye West.

19:07.680 --> 19:09.148
Oh, my God.

19:09.182 --> 19:10.783
Oh, my God,
I'm gonna be sick.

19:10.817 --> 19:12.385
-Okay. Edgar.
-Oh, my God.

19:12.419 --> 19:13.720
Look at me. Edgar.

19:13.753 --> 19:15.288
(panting)

19:15.322 --> 19:17.690
-You have such a giving spirit.
-(quietly): Yeah.

19:17.724 --> 19:19.726
You deserve to drop
a little green on yourself.

19:19.759 --> 19:21.127
-Yeah.
-Plus,

19:21.160 --> 19:22.895
in a few years,
when we're running

19:22.929 --> 19:24.864
Max and Edgar Love Sketches,

19:24.897 --> 19:27.500
six thou? That's six dollars.

19:27.534 --> 19:30.803
It's six pennies, it's six--
it's three pennies.

19:30.837 --> 19:32.539
(exhales)

19:32.572 --> 19:35.375
Okay.

19:35.408 --> 19:37.210
Thanks for talking me down.

19:37.244 --> 19:38.811
Hey, anytime.

19:38.845 --> 19:41.214
After all,
I do need a new main dude

19:41.248 --> 19:43.550
now that Brent's snoobering
in Colorado.

19:43.583 --> 19:45.252
Really?

19:45.285 --> 19:47.287
(dog barking in distance)

19:51.123 --> 19:53.059
*

19:53.092 --> 19:55.094
Good cake, huh?

19:55.127 --> 19:57.063
Yeah.

19:57.096 --> 19:59.332
Red velvet's my favorite.

19:59.366 --> 20:00.800
Not a real flavor.

20:01.468 --> 20:03.169
Wh... ? Hey.

20:03.202 --> 20:04.904
I explicitly told you
I wasn't ready

20:04.937 --> 20:07.073
for Olivia to meet you yet.

20:07.106 --> 20:09.542
Exactly, Boone.

20:09.576 --> 20:11.378
Not a name, by the way.

20:11.411 --> 20:13.880
Man, usually it takes a minute

20:13.913 --> 20:16.549
for a guy's true feelings
to reveal themselves.

20:16.583 --> 20:20.186
How "I'm damaged and only good
for having fun now."

20:20.219 --> 20:23.690
-But when you said I can't meet
your dau... -Hey. Dummy.

20:23.723 --> 20:25.625
I didn't want you to meet her
for her sake.

20:25.658 --> 20:27.794
Because she's a child
and I have an obligation

20:27.827 --> 20:29.729
to not have her get attached
to people too early.

20:29.762 --> 20:31.264
Jesus.

20:31.298 --> 20:33.933
Why am I even justifying
myself to you?

20:33.966 --> 20:35.968
Oh, right,
because I like you.

20:37.770 --> 20:39.706
Or did.

20:39.739 --> 20:42.309
Good-bye, Gretchen.

20:42.342 --> 20:44.243
And Boone is totally
a real name.

20:47.514 --> 20:49.316
I'm sorry.

20:49.349 --> 20:51.083
Hey. Boone.

20:51.117 --> 20:53.586
I-I'm sorry.

20:53.620 --> 20:57.324
It's just that I have
strong feelings for you.

20:57.357 --> 20:59.726
And it hurt
when you didn't think

20:59.759 --> 21:01.294
I was worthy of meeting
your daughter,

21:01.328 --> 21:04.797
'cause she's part of you.

21:04.831 --> 21:06.799
What I am saying is

21:06.833 --> 21:08.801
if you want to go down the road,

21:08.835 --> 21:12.439
I want to go down it, too...
with you.

21:15.808 --> 21:18.277
Look, I've had thoughts, too.

21:18.311 --> 21:20.146
But I was worried
I might still be

21:20.179 --> 21:22.148
marriage brainwashed.

21:22.181 --> 21:24.183
(sighs) Shit.

21:24.216 --> 21:26.619
Maybe we should go for it.

21:30.890 --> 21:32.091
Okay.

21:32.124 --> 21:33.526
Uh...

21:33.560 --> 21:35.294
I still have to take
Olivia home,

21:35.328 --> 21:38.531
or she's gonna be a real
piece of shit in the morning.

21:38.565 --> 21:40.867
Let's hang tomorrow, okay?

21:40.900 --> 21:42.335
-Okay.
-Okay.

21:42.369 --> 21:44.537
Uh, let's go, sweetie.

21:52.979 --> 21:55.782
Adrienne, please come out.

21:55.815 --> 21:57.950
And bring towels,
for God's sake.

21:57.984 --> 21:59.619
ADRIENNE:
No!

21:59.652 --> 22:03.456
(crying): I always get too drunk
at these things.

22:03.490 --> 22:07.727
(moaning): Oh, God.
My whole career is a lie.

22:07.760 --> 22:10.162
How can I write erotica

22:10.196 --> 22:13.366
when I've never even had
an orgasm?

22:13.400 --> 22:15.668
What? You totally...

22:15.702 --> 22:18.037
I fake them.

22:18.070 --> 22:20.407
(crying)

22:20.440 --> 22:23.042
What are they like, Jimmy?

22:23.075 --> 22:24.577
I've heard it's like

22:24.611 --> 22:27.480
when you have to pee really bad,
and then you do.

22:27.514 --> 22:29.382
Is that what it's like?

22:29.416 --> 22:32.419
Well, I don't want to rub it in,
but they're kind of

22:32.452 --> 22:34.987
the only truly transcendent
thing in this world.

22:35.021 --> 22:36.656
(crying):
Please, no.

22:36.689 --> 22:38.691
(phone rings)

22:41.260 --> 22:43.262
(sobbing):
Oh, I hate myself.

22:43.295 --> 22:45.197
I use the thesaurus app

22:45.231 --> 22:46.399
with everything I write.

22:46.433 --> 22:49.168
I give talks on body positivity,

22:49.201 --> 22:51.604
but I bought a waist trainer
on the Internet.

22:51.638 --> 22:53.606
(sobs)

22:53.640 --> 22:57.744
-Jimmy? Jimmy.
-(door closing)

22:57.777 --> 23:00.913
GRETCHEN (on phone):
Sorry to bug you.

23:00.947 --> 23:02.281
The patio door is stuck again.

23:04.383 --> 23:07.587
Well, there's, um,
WD-40 in the garage.

23:07.620 --> 23:09.255
That usually does it.

23:09.288 --> 23:12.091
Thanks.

23:12.124 --> 23:15.495
No problem.

23:18.064 --> 23:19.466
So...

23:21.100 --> 23:22.602
How is the work trip?

23:25.304 --> 23:27.239
Well,

23:27.273 --> 23:30.777
I learned there's
a whole genre of erotica

23:30.810 --> 23:34.113
that's just women having sex
with werewolves.

23:34.146 --> 23:36.483
What? We talking wolf-human sex?

23:36.516 --> 23:38.384
And quite often,

23:38.417 --> 23:40.219
they're historical werewolves.

23:40.252 --> 23:41.954
Shut up.

23:41.988 --> 23:45.124
Like werewolves who are also
Civil War soldiers and shit?

23:45.157 --> 23:48.628
Jimmy, that's hella hot.

23:48.661 --> 23:52.264
You got to bring me
one of those books.

23:52.298 --> 23:55.134
I have two in my bag.

24:01.107 --> 24:02.575
Hey,

24:02.609 --> 24:03.910
so you won't believe
who showed up

24:03.943 --> 24:05.478
to Lindsay's divorce party
tonight.

24:05.512 --> 24:06.946
Divorce party, where?

24:06.979 --> 24:08.247
Shh, don't worry about it.

24:08.280 --> 24:09.582
But listen,

24:09.616 --> 24:11.250
guess who walked in?

24:11.283 --> 24:13.019
-Paul.
-No.

24:13.052 --> 24:14.320
Yes.

24:14.353 --> 24:15.622
And barf,

24:15.655 --> 24:18.257
-but he might be secret hot now.
-Yes!

24:18.290 --> 24:19.992
I thought the same thing.

24:20.026 --> 24:22.294
He looks like a hot Nazi.

24:22.328 --> 24:24.330
Like Ralph in
The Sound of Music.

24:24.363 --> 24:25.665
Yes.

24:25.698 --> 24:27.867
Anyway, so Paul comes in

24:27.900 --> 24:30.136
cackling like a super villain...

24:30.169 --> 24:34.306
* I want

24:34.340 --> 24:38.611
* I want you

24:38.645 --> 24:41.147
* I want you to kiss me

24:41.180 --> 24:44.150
* Behind my ear

24:46.853 --> 24:48.988
* There's a mean wind

24:49.021 --> 24:50.890
* Blowing today

24:50.923 --> 24:52.458
* It's pushing me

24:52.491 --> 24:54.226
* To both go and stay,
but I... *

Hey.

25:07.940 --> 25:10.543

go down on me?
