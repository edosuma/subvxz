00:08.029 --> 00:09.366
Cheryl!

00:10.909 --> 00:12.246
Cheryl!

00:15.229 --> 00:17.817
The babies are asleep!
What did you do?

00:18.007 --> 00:19.344
My shirt got me!

00:24.693 --> 00:26.030
The light!

00:27.985 --> 00:32.716
I'm sorry honey, I'm just so tired.
Been up all night with the twins.

00:33.436 --> 00:34.774
You went up once!

00:36.111 --> 00:38.580
What are you talking about?
When you got up you woke me up!

00:40.226 --> 00:42.092
And when you walk, your bones crack!

00:42.746 --> 00:44.083
How old are you?

00:45.472 --> 00:47.647
- I'm tired!
- You're tired?

00:47.756 --> 00:51.967
I'm the one raising three kids and two babies.
You don't even get to use the word "tired"!

00:52.498 --> 00:58.494
How about "I got a job"? Can I use
the word "mortgage"? "Bills"?
"College fund"?

01:00.119 --> 01:01.476
Alright, I can't say that one.

01:02.759 --> 01:07.689
You can use any words you want. I will just
say "breast feeding" and "C section".

01:08.550 --> 01:10.743
Don't try to confuse me
by saying "breast"!

01:11.860 --> 01:15.776
- I'm not gonna have this fight with you.
- I don't wanna have it either.

01:16.799 --> 01:20.524
Listen, I've got a Bears game to watch this
afternoon and they never win when I'm tired!

01:22.430 --> 01:25.166
Are you planning sitting downstairs all
day watching television?

01:25.557 --> 01:28.772
Of course not, honey!
I'm gonna go to a bar!

01:30.716 --> 01:33.941
I can't concentrate through those kids
screaming down there.

01:36.916 --> 01:39.583
- What the hell is that?
- It's the video game you got them.

01:39.794 --> 01:42.398
- Go, go, go, get the babies!
- Oh, just when I got them down!

01:42.408 --> 01:44.387
I got them down!

01:46.365 --> 01:48.394
OK, cool, fine, sure!

02:03.935 --> 02:05.888
Hey, the babies are sleeping.
Keep it down!

02:07.429 --> 02:08.457
Keep it down!

02:10.923 --> 02:12.130
Keep it down!

02:12.464 --> 02:14.621
What are you doing?
We were rocking the house!

02:14.690 --> 02:18.307
Yeah, well, if you wake up those babies
you're gonna be rock in a box under the bridge.

02:21.129 --> 02:22.711
Look what you did!

02:23.938 --> 02:24.705
Cheryl?

02:26.324 --> 02:30.268
- I hear the babies crying.
- Thanks for the update, Jim.

02:31.483 --> 02:33.608
Not a fan of that tone, Cheryl.

02:37.011 --> 02:40.067
- Didn't you hear what I said?
- Why can't we play, the babies are up anyway?

02:40.787 --> 02:41.937
Cheryl! Cheryl!

02:43.280 --> 02:44.620
Alright, that's it.

02:47.064 --> 02:51.377
Look, you've upset your mother
and that's for a full nights rest.

02:53.589 --> 02:59.364
Alright everybody, listen up. I'm leaving, I'll
be gone for hours and I'm not gonna tell you
where I'm going. Goodbye.

03:00.292 --> 03:02.457
Wait a second, Cheryl.
I think you're forgetting something.

03:03.282 --> 03:07.096
- And what might that be, Jim?
- Well, the kids, the laundry...

03:07.251 --> 03:08.848
And I've got a Bears game on at noon.

03:10.086 --> 03:13.076
I didn't forget.
I haven't slept for weeks, I'm at my limit.

03:13.384 --> 03:18.024
- Are you leaving because of us, mummy?
- Absolutely.

03:19.674 --> 03:22.921
See! Once I would have lied to spare
your feelings but those days are gone!

03:23.179 --> 03:24.623
Cheryl, Cheryl, Cheryl.

03:26.066 --> 03:28.231
- Cheryl, you can't go!
- Why?

03:29.056 --> 03:30.396
Because we're a team.

03:32.871 --> 03:35.531
- Alright, I didn't believe that either.
- Goodbye.

03:36.428 --> 03:37.768
Cheryl, listen to that!

03:38.510 --> 03:46.763
Crap, crap, crap! Jonathan cries all day long.
With my weak heart I might be dead.

03:48.026 --> 03:52.046
If he cries, pick him up or give him this.
This is his snowman blankie.

03:52.078 --> 03:54.521
If you lose this, you'd wish you were dead.

03:55.552 --> 03:58.439
And for making me cross the room unnecessarily,
I'm gonna stay out an extra hour.

03:59.057 --> 04:01.222
Don't follow me!

04:05.140 --> 04:07.203
You broke your mother!

04:09.161 --> 04:13.285
- What are we gonna do, daddy?
- We all gotta take some responsibility in this house.

04:13.285 --> 04:18.851
Alright, you kids watch the twins,
while I go make lunch.

04:18.904 --> 04:22.513
- Can we have grilled cheese?
- I didn't say I was making lunch to you!

Ruby, Gracie? I need you to watch
the babies for five minutes.

04:53.597 --> 04:55.453
Look at that, huh?

05:01.845 --> 05:03.185
Here.

05:04.216 --> 05:05.557
Grab it.

05:07.205 --> 05:09.062
Act like it's your mommy's boob.

05:22.259 --> 05:24.630
That's called using your head.

05:28.445 --> 05:31.022
My god, game time.

05:32.775 --> 05:34.115
OK.

05:34.218 --> 05:37.414
I'm gonna put you down.
OK?

05:37.929 --> 05:39.786
Look at Gordon.
See?

05:39.991 --> 05:45.147
Why can't you be happy and quiet like Gordon?
No, you gotta be the difficult one.

05:56.384 --> 05:58.549
Let me just give you that little blankie.

05:59.581 --> 06:01.126
Where's the blankie?

06:02.158 --> 06:03.000
Gordon, you have it?

06:05.251 --> 06:06.591
Where's the blankie?

06:09.065 --> 06:11.102
Hi, hi!

06:12.055 --> 06:14.297
Alright, alright, alright.
I got you.

06:16.283 --> 06:18.731
Jonathan, I can't hold you
for the whole game.

06:19.066 --> 06:21.205
I might spank you by accident.

06:24.427 --> 06:25.664
Man, o man!

06:26.541 --> 06:31.725
Is there anything better than 10.5 hours of sleep?
Answer: a two hour nap after breakfast!

06:32.510 --> 06:36.480
Shut your yapping and help me find this
stupid baby his stupid snowman blankie.

06:36.556 --> 06:39.515
You know Jim? You get more flies with honey.

06:40.704 --> 06:42.069
Kids, get down here!

06:43.537 --> 06:47.507
They're supposed to watch the babies during the game.
Now they've lost the kid's blankie.

06:47.684 --> 06:51.958
Well, just draw a snowman on a paper towel.
He won't know, babies are idiots.

06:52.135 --> 06:54.462
I thought so too, but they know!

06:54.766 --> 06:56.921
It's like... they're people.

06:57.497 --> 07:01.013
This blankie is like you and that stupid
stuffed elephant you had as a kid.

07:01.544 --> 07:04.820
Lord Tuskington is not stupid!

07:04.896 --> 07:09.087
He's a lifelong companion. And if I
rub his ears, he takes me to Dreamland.

07:09.164 --> 07:10.104
Oh, come on!

07:11.399 --> 07:16.505
Where have you been?
You're supposed to watch the baby!

07:16.581 --> 07:19.350
We finished that, so we
decided to go watch TV.

07:20.239 --> 07:22.601
- You lost his blankie!
- Gracie!

07:22.617 --> 07:25.345
- Ruby!
- Kyle!

07:26.335 --> 07:30.729
Alright, everybody's gotta pitch in here
and have some responsibility.

07:31.314 --> 07:35.098
Finally, finally, you three rats
are getting what's coming to you!

07:35.581 --> 07:37.639
Beat them, Jim. Beat them.
Beat them with the belt.

07:38.122 --> 07:44.040
Andy, just settle down here alright?
And promise you'll never have children.

07:44.522 --> 07:49.222
Why not? 44 inches of reversible
pleather make for very obedient kids.

07:49.602 --> 07:52.574
- Andy!
- Fine, 56.

07:52.676 --> 07:56.232
Ok, kids, you are not responsible
enough to watch your brother

07:56.258 --> 07:58.925
So you gotta do my job.

07:58.976 --> 08:01.008
Drink coffee and read the paper?

08:02.811 --> 08:05.936
OK, Ruby, start making dinner.
Gracie, laundry.

08:05.960 --> 08:09.746
Kyle, upstairs, make the bed, clean
the trash and pick up these toys.

08:10.533 --> 08:13.201
- We're sorry we lost the blankie, dad.
- I don't wanna hear you're sorry.

08:13.277 --> 08:17.264
I wanna hear vacuuming, scrubbing
and the sound that a meatloaf makes.

08:19.068 --> 08:23.767
Dammit. If we don't find that blankie we're
gonna have to hold them for the whole game.

08:24.351 --> 08:27.730
Hey, how about taking them for a drive, that
usually calms them down?

08:29.026 --> 08:33.623
Yeah, that is a great idea.
That is your uncle Andy.

08:33.902 --> 08:36.772
OK, you can take my truck, just have
them back at the end of the game.

08:39.491 --> 08:41.650
Oh my god!

08:43.047 --> 08:45.714
The blankie, I've had it the whole time!

08:46.501 --> 08:49.778
I must have put it in my pocket when
I was putting stuff in my pocket.

08:50.565 --> 08:52.623
Wow!

08:52.801 --> 08:57.601
You yelled at your kids for no reason.
I think someone owes them an apology.

08:57.677 --> 09:03.799
I don't owe them nothing. They never
pitch in around here. And I finally got
them up working.

09:02.758 --> 09:03.901
Dad?

09:04.790 --> 09:06.441
And I intend to keep it that way.

09:07.940 --> 09:11.115
- Yes?
- Do you want mashed potatoes with the meatloaf?

09:13.020 --> 09:17.516
Why, yes, I want mashed potato with my
meatloaf. And some gravy.

09:17.998 --> 09:21.276
- Don't you think that's dishonest?
- Ruby?

09:22.063 --> 09:24.630
And make sure there's enough
for uncle Andy!

09:27.675 --> 09:31.831
Yeah! And bake a cake,
it's my half-birthday!

09:32.063 --> 09:34.026
You heard the man,
hop to it!

09:44.985 --> 09:48.870
Oh, nice, nice, nice!

09:51.389 --> 09:53.964
Alright, settle down, Jonathan.

10:05.217 --> 10:07.111
- That's my boy!
- Dad?

10:07.274 --> 10:08.672
Oh, Jesus!

10:11.094 --> 10:14.677
- I'm done with the laundry.
- You finished the laundry? Good girl!

10:17.859 --> 10:20.788
But you didn't find the
blankie that you lost?

10:23.663 --> 10:26.333
You know what?
Maybe it's at the bottom of the diaper pail.

10:29.688 --> 10:30.874
Why don't you clean it, honey?

10:43.408 --> 10:47.266
Jim? What's up?
What's Kyle doing up on the roof?

10:46.856 --> 10:52.249
Oh, partly looking for the blankie. And partly
putting Santa and the reindeer up.

10:54.213 --> 10:56.388
Good job! You're gonna
have him do the lights?

10:56.489 --> 10:58.796
Oh, come on Andy.
That's unsafe.

10:59.639 --> 11:04.297
You know what, Jim? I've been thinking about
this new work force we have available.

11:04.372 --> 11:09.835
I mean, Ruby's cooking is nice. But her meatloaf
won't fetch the dead pigeon out of my crawl space..

11:11.723 --> 11:16.280
Well... I'm hearing a man's looking to make a deal?

11:17.766 --> 11:19.994
Alright...
I'm reasonable.

11:20.383 --> 11:22.527
I'll rent my kids...

11:24.014 --> 11:27.770
- What is the offer?
- Now we're talking!

11:27.872 --> 11:33.217
The kids work whenever I need them. And in
exchange, I don't rat you out to Cheryl.

11:33.898 --> 11:37.847
Come on!
What kind of low dirty deal is that?

11:37.922 --> 11:41.668
I made you an honest offer of slave
labor and you try to extort me??

11:41.945 --> 11:44.485
The way I see it, I hold
all the cards here.

11:44.562 --> 11:49.917
Now tell Gracie to get some matches. I've got a burned
out pilot light that her tiny fingers just might reach.

11:50.798 --> 11:53.097
You know, I've got some tiny fingers
and I'd like to do them up your nose.

11:53.291 --> 11:53.914
- You're gonna play some hardball?

11:56.582 --> 12:03.113
- Hey honey, you're back!
- Yeah, well, I got halfway to my exboyfriend before I started to feel guilty.

12:03.205 --> 12:07.194
- Come on!
- Spent the day at a spa and it was just what I needed!

12:07.582 --> 12:08.646
- Wow, this looks great!
- Doesn't it?

12:10.352 --> 12:12.964
Oh, there are my babies!

12:13.031 --> 12:15.104
Do I smell dinner?

12:15.293 --> 12:19.843
Oh, it is so cute, Kyle is
up doing a snow angel.

12:25.094 --> 12:29.899
- Jim, you gotta tell me your secret!
- Well...

12:30.179 --> 12:36.002
Yeah, Jim, tell her!
I would but I'm drawing a blankie.

12:37.401 --> 12:42.105
- Knock it off!
- I just wanna wet my beak. Some laundry,
some light dusting and a casserole.

12:42.384 --> 12:44.151
No deal! Forget it.

12:45.211 --> 12:47.308
Alright! What's going on?

12:49.813 --> 12:53.355
Your husband - a man
I never liked -

12:55.084 --> 12:59.944
- lost Jonathan's blankie!
And then blamed the kids for it!

13:00.246 --> 13:06.927
He then found the blankie, hid it and guilted
the kids into doing all the work around here.

13:07.200 --> 13:08.491
Jim...

13:10.031 --> 13:13.442
That is genius!

13:16.423 --> 13:18.706
- No, no, no!
- Yes, it is!

13:19.860 --> 13:27.591
- It's evil. It's only genius if I get a piece!
- You heard the girl. It's genius!

13:27.686 --> 13:29.683
- A casserole and a car wash!
- Out!

13:30.026 --> 13:32.047
- A sandwich and a backrub!
- Out!

13:32.118 --> 13:35.200
- A cracker and a back scratch? A pleasant smile?
- Out!

13:35.273 --> 13:37.489
Wait, wait, wait, Jim. Be reasonable.

13:38.266 --> 13:41.977
I think Andy deserves a pleasant smile.

13:55.423 --> 13:59.021
- Right, the babies are asleep.
- Oh, great, great. You didn't forget the blankie, did you?

13:59.097 --> 14:01.164
Cause if the kids find it, we're screwed.

14:02.567 --> 14:05.858
A mummy don't make mistakes like that!

14:06.649 --> 14:11.982
- You know, Jonathan spit up on that earlier.
- That's alright, he spit up in here too.

14:12.263 --> 14:16.064
They're coming, get the blankie, get the blankie!
Hide it, get in bed, get in bed!

14:19.917 --> 14:21.167
Here you go!

14:24.000 --> 14:26.270
- Thank you.
- Thanks kids, but for the record:

14:26.347 --> 14:29.331
12.15 means 12.15.

14:30.837 --> 14:36.475
You know what is better than breakfast in bed?
Lunch in bed.

14:37.266 --> 14:42.599
- I wonder if there's anything better than lunch in bed?
- Perhaps we find out at 6 o'clock?

14:42.676 --> 14:47.702
- Are you guys ever going to get up?
- I don't know honey, we're really tired.

14:47.778 --> 14:50.085
Took us a long time to get your
brother to sleep last night.

14:50.637 --> 14:53.826
You know,
without his blankie.

14:54.820 --> 14:59.949
Remember kids, how
you lost his blankie?

15:00.026 --> 15:06.787
- Well, they are sleeping now!
- Sometimes they fall asleep from fatigue and sibling neglect.

15:07.823 --> 15:10.869
Sorry! But I'm defrosting some short ribs for dinner.

15:10.945 --> 15:18.319
Great. Oh, and listen. There's a funny noise
in daddy's car. Can you check under the hood for me?

15:20.029 --> 15:23.103
To fewer kids and more servants.

15:28.364 --> 15:34.168
Oh, look at you working so hard.
What is this, an orphanage?

15:34.879 --> 15:39.081
What a shame. Especially when
it's completely unnecessary.

15:39.615 --> 15:42.544
If you got a point,
get to it, fatty!

15:43.491 --> 15:45.923
We've got windows to do.

15:46.591 --> 15:52.317
Look, I've some information you're gonna want.
To get it, I need a little light shoveling -

15:52.387 --> 15:56.807
- and a pilot light relit in a poorly ventilated
closet that may or may not have spiders.

16:00.625 --> 16:01.290
Deal!

16:02.115 --> 16:08.087
You never lost the blankie! Your dad
had it in his pocket the whole time!

16:10.365 --> 16:13.046
Oh my gosh, our
parents are jerks!

16:14.042 --> 16:16.349
I never liked them.

16:16.548 --> 16:21.935
- What do we do?
- Lucky for you you've got an uncle with a spectacular plan!

16:22.097 --> 16:26.375
- What is it?
- We can talk while you clear an opossum's nest out of my chimney.

16:35.930 --> 16:38.689
Cheryl, the twins are gonna be up in a
minute, where's the blankie?

16:38.768 --> 16:40.265
It's under your pillow.

16:43.709 --> 16:46.573
- No, not here.
- That's where I put it.

16:48.755 --> 16:50.778
Well, it's not there now.

16:53.695 --> 16:54.983
Check your bra.

16:56.535 --> 16:58.720
- It's not there.
- Let me check!

17:01.574 --> 17:04.376
- Find it!
- It's not here!

17:06.509 --> 17:08.489
Looking for something?

17:11.753 --> 17:15.173
No, we're just...
making the bed.

17:16.381 --> 17:18.771
Which is really a job for the kids. Hop to it!

17:20.185 --> 17:23.913
I don't think so.
Those days are over.

17:24.298 --> 17:28.436
- What are you talking about?
- Maybe this picture will explain.

17:31.702 --> 17:33.681
It's the blankie!

17:34.684 --> 17:36.807
With today's newspaper!

17:38.480 --> 17:44.710
Get yourselves cleaned up and come downstairs.
We'll talk business while you cook short ribs.

17:46.472 --> 17:48.795
Andy's right.
Get the belt!

17:57.761 --> 18:04.180
What kind of parents lie to their children and
blackmail them into doing all the house work?

18:05.453 --> 18:08.575
It was her idea.
I love you all!

18:09.350 --> 18:16.467
Me? I was just getting a massage and a sea weed wrap.
Hey, who wants to have the next birthday party at the spa?

18:16.572 --> 18:19.165
Me, me me!

18:19.839 --> 18:24.659
- Kyle!
- Hey, if you fell off the roof you'd want a massage too!

18:24.734 --> 18:28.755
Let's cut to the chase. What do you guys want for
the blankie? I'm sure we can work something out!

18:29.230 --> 18:32.452
- We start with no more cooking!
- Or cleaning or laundry.

18:32.556 --> 18:35.049
And I really want that spa birthday!

18:36.622 --> 18:42.841
- Deal, deal, where's the blankie?
- Wait, wait, no deal yet. You can't negotiate without seeing the blankie!

18:42.916 --> 18:46.138
- Jim, get serious!
- I am serious too!

18:46.612 --> 18:51.133
If we give in to this right now,
it's gonna open up a panda's box.

18:52.407 --> 18:57.127
They're gonna want TV:s, days
off from school and vaccinations!

18:57.502 --> 19:01.123
I wanna see the blankie.
I wanna see the blankie now!

19:01.432 --> 19:04.232
OK, OK, everybody, be cool!

19:10.389 --> 19:14.610
Give them what they want,
or I'll do this blankie right now!

19:16.383 --> 19:19.605
- That voice is familiar.
- Yeah...

19:20.479 --> 19:22.702
And so is that double chin.

19:30.669 --> 19:32.592
What can I do you for?

19:33.366 --> 19:38.486
- Andy! It this you?
- You called me, you know who it is!

19:38.561 --> 19:39.585
Dammit!

19:41.658 --> 19:45.279
He probably got that blankie
across the street right now!

19:46.553 --> 19:49.575
You think you're so smart,
I'm not across the street!

19:54.345 --> 19:55.569
Dammit!

19:56.343 --> 19:59.565
- OK, OK, OK!
- What, what, what?

19:59.640 --> 20:04.860
We can still keep the blankie for ourselves,
as long as the kids and Cheryl don't find out.

20:07.232 --> 20:09.555
- I like where you're going.
- Yeah, yeah.

20:10.329 --> 20:14.340
The kids, they're idiots
Cheryl's gonna be the tough one to fool.

20:14.425 --> 20:19.335
Oh please. I act dumb but she's the slow one.

20:20.519 --> 20:24.540
- We can see you!
- Dammit!

20:29.310 --> 20:36.528
- Alright, I know we may have taken things a little too far.
- Well, I wanted to tone it down but your mother kept rambling.

20:37.103 --> 20:40.474
Anyway, the truth is that we're now a family of seven.
And the only way we can survive -

20:40.499 --> 20:44.760
-  is by all pitching in together.
- That's right, and, well -

20:44.770 --> 20:48.516
maybe it wasn't right for us to trick you
into doing things, mummy's sneaky plan.

20:49.311 --> 20:54.710
- But I admit, you guys really made a difference around here!
- I felt good to help out.

20:54.785 --> 21:02.003
- Sure it did, you didn't had to clean out the diaper pail.
- And you didn't had to be bit by an opossum!

21:03.077 --> 21:07.607
Look, the point is, we are a family
and we stick together!

21:07.672 --> 21:11.493
- Now daddy and I are gonna spend the day relaxing.
- What, no fair!

21:11.505 --> 21:14.386
- Calm down, I've got you some help.

21:16.374 --> 21:17.874
Your stupid johnnycakes are ready!

21:19.111 --> 21:21.484
- Awesome!
- Seriously, we're gonna get our own service?

21:21.758 --> 21:24.481
Yes, get the belt!

21:25.055 --> 21:27.478
Here, take mine!

21:28.305 --> 21:34.384
