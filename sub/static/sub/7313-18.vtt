WEBVTT

00:03.177 --> 00:05.962
That's one, two,
three solid leads.

00:06.006 --> 00:06.919
Three.

00:06.963 --> 00:09.052
We'd need 30
private contracts

00:09.096 --> 00:10.532
to make up the kind
of revenue we're out.

00:10.575 --> 00:12.447
Hey, we're doing
our best here.

00:12.490 --> 00:14.144
You got 80%
of the company

00:14.188 --> 00:15.841
in bed with
the Navy, and...

00:15.885 --> 00:17.452
And what, Ron?

00:17.495 --> 00:18.931
We need that
military contract.

00:18.975 --> 00:20.281
Not gonna happen.

00:20.324 --> 00:21.586
Navy wants to go light.

00:21.630 --> 00:23.458
Steel is out,
poly fiber is in.

00:23.501 --> 00:26.678
Dalton, did the
contract expire,

00:26.722 --> 00:28.071
or did it expire?Expired.

00:28.115 --> 00:29.072
And are we gonna
get it back?

00:29.116 --> 00:30.856
Don't see it happening.

00:30.900 --> 00:32.423
Legal doesn't see
it happening, Ron.

00:32.467 --> 00:34.164
Maybe we should
stop yapping about

00:34.208 --> 00:35.948
a Navy contract
we don't have anymore

00:35.992 --> 00:38.255
[slams hand on table]and figure out how
to sell some damn steel!

00:41.128 --> 00:42.955
I have to go.

00:42.999 --> 00:45.088
Give our best
to the Secretary of the Navy.

00:45.132 --> 00:47.221
And good luck
with the speech.

00:50.137 --> 00:51.921
As President and CEO

00:51.964 --> 00:54.619
of Wickes Steel & Shipbuilding,

00:54.663 --> 00:56.926
I'm proud of the work
my family has put

00:56.969 --> 00:59.146
into building
these great machines.

00:59.189 --> 01:03.454
They're an unshakable foundation
upon which the Navy

01:03.498 --> 01:07.371
can take her fleet
to new heights.

01:08.764 --> 01:10.331
How was that?

01:10.374 --> 01:11.723
MAN:
That was perfect, sir.
Thank you.

01:11.767 --> 01:13.160
WICKES:
Was I loud enough?

01:13.203 --> 01:14.509
JARVIS:
Always are.

01:14.552 --> 01:16.032
[laughs]

01:16.076 --> 01:17.903
Mr. Secretary, I...

01:17.947 --> 01:19.992
I feel sorry for you
having to follow that.

01:20.036 --> 01:21.733
Oh, I was going
to have you take a look

01:21.777 --> 01:22.952
at my speech,
maybe do a little punch up.

01:22.995 --> 01:25.607
WICKES [chuckles]:
Like old times, huh?

01:25.650 --> 01:27.087
We made a
great team.

01:27.130 --> 01:28.523
I mean, older and wiser

01:28.566 --> 01:30.264
shows me how to
hit the books.

01:30.307 --> 01:32.570
Younger and more
handsome shows you[chuckles]

01:32.614 --> 01:34.006
how to win the hearts.

01:34.050 --> 01:35.791
Ah, That was a
long time ago.

01:35.834 --> 01:38.663
A less
complicated time.Hm.

01:38.707 --> 01:42.102
Um, you know...

01:42.145 --> 01:44.104
we have business to
talk about, Clayton.

01:44.147 --> 01:45.540
Sure. Well, uh...

01:45.583 --> 01:47.063
we'll do it privately.
I'll come over to house.

01:47.107 --> 01:50.153
Better hurry, I may not own
the place much longer.

01:50.197 --> 01:53.025
Get down!
Falcon down!

01:53.069 --> 01:55.593
He's been hit in the chest.

01:55.637 --> 01:57.117
Stop him!

02:37.157 --> 02:39.202
[whispers]:
Hey, McGee.

02:39.246 --> 02:41.073
Vance is not here, either.

02:41.117 --> 02:43.163
Doesn't his son have a
soccer game in Alexandria?

02:43.206 --> 02:44.164
No, that is next week.

02:44.207 --> 02:45.774
Tony's ignoring my calls,

02:45.817 --> 02:47.993
and it is very unlike Gibbs
to just disappear like this.

02:48.037 --> 02:49.908
[whispers]:
Something is going on.

02:49.952 --> 02:51.649
Actually, I think Tony
said something about

02:51.693 --> 02:53.216
being on SECNAV's PSD today.

02:53.260 --> 02:54.391
That's probably
a cover.

02:54.435 --> 02:57.177
I think they must be at

02:57.220 --> 03:00.223
some kind of man day.

03:00.267 --> 03:02.051
You know, when

03:02.094 --> 03:04.227
men take a day to do
man things together.

03:04.271 --> 03:05.881
Really?
Yes.

03:05.924 --> 03:07.230
And just because I am a woman,
they do not have the courtesy

03:07.274 --> 03:08.362
to tell me where
they are going

03:08.405 --> 03:10.233
or when they will be back.

03:10.277 --> 03:11.234
I'm a man.

03:11.278 --> 03:13.236
That's right!

03:13.280 --> 03:15.630
Which makes this even worse.

03:15.673 --> 03:17.109
I'm going to Tony again.

03:20.243 --> 03:21.592
[phone ringing]

03:24.204 --> 03:26.728
We're doing our best to keep
the investigation closed.

03:26.771 --> 03:28.033
Clayton?

03:28.077 --> 03:29.992
Uh, no update yet,
Mr. Wickes.

03:30.035 --> 03:32.124
We're trying to keep this
out of the press.

03:32.168 --> 03:35.084
The less our shooter knows,
the better off we are.

03:35.127 --> 03:37.086
Okay, we're asking
these people

03:37.129 --> 03:39.044
to not say anything
about what they saw.

03:39.088 --> 03:41.133
I saw a man with a gun.

03:41.177 --> 03:42.178
Right, I got that.

03:42.222 --> 03:43.571
So you're going to be
in this group.

03:43.614 --> 03:44.615
You're going to answer
their questions,

03:44.659 --> 03:45.834
then you're going
to go home.

03:45.877 --> 03:47.052
Okay? You're going
to lay low

03:47.096 --> 03:48.271
and you're going
to tell your people

03:48.315 --> 03:49.707
that you need
some personal time.

03:49.751 --> 03:50.882
No, I don't want that.

03:50.926 --> 03:51.927
I want him kept separate
from the group.

03:51.970 --> 03:53.058
He was standing
next to Jarvis.

03:53.102 --> 03:54.234
He had a better
view than anybody.

03:54.277 --> 03:55.974
The gunman,
he was wearing a blue hat.

03:56.018 --> 03:57.280
I saw him.Okay, okay.

03:57.324 --> 03:59.108
We're going to put you
with a sketch artist,

03:59.151 --> 04:00.762
You write down
everything you remember.

04:00.805 --> 04:02.329
Of course, anything.

04:02.372 --> 04:04.418
VANCE:
Gibbs.

04:04.461 --> 04:06.507
Massive blood loss,
doesn't look good.

04:06.550 --> 04:08.291
His family's
been notified.

04:08.335 --> 04:10.293
Agent Gibbs, follow me
to the hospital.
DiNozzo,

04:10.337 --> 04:11.468
you put him in a car
back to headquarters.

04:11.512 --> 04:12.948
I'll meet you there.

04:22.827 --> 04:24.220
Gentlemen,

04:24.264 --> 04:26.178
welcome to the party.

04:26.222 --> 04:27.441
It's BYOS:

04:27.484 --> 04:28.833
Bring Your Own Shooter.

04:28.877 --> 04:30.270
I brought mine--

04:30.313 --> 04:31.532
Tyler Elliott,

04:31.575 --> 04:32.750
my lead investigator.

04:32.794 --> 04:34.143
Gibbs, Vance, NCIS.

04:34.186 --> 04:35.362
Agent Gibbs, bravo.

04:35.405 --> 04:36.537
Big doubts about you going in,

04:36.580 --> 04:38.974
but you were way better
than expected.

04:39.017 --> 04:40.584
Meryl Streep better.Ah.

04:40.628 --> 04:41.933
Take that as a compliment.

04:41.977 --> 04:44.240
This one tells it
like it is, to a fault.

04:44.284 --> 04:45.981
Been there for
the real thing.

04:46.024 --> 04:48.723
Are you confirming that all our
marks were hit, Doctor?

04:48.766 --> 04:49.985
[door opens]

04:50.028 --> 04:52.204
On the money, Leon.

04:52.248 --> 04:53.815
Break out the champagne.

04:53.858 --> 04:56.208
Opening night was a success.

04:56.252 --> 04:58.123
Well done.

05:09.352 --> 05:11.006
McGEE:
Hey, where you been,
we've been calling?

05:11.049 --> 05:12.355
What's going on?

05:12.399 --> 05:14.183
Man day is over,
and he is still ignoring us.

05:14.226 --> 05:15.619
I am not going to be ignored.

05:15.663 --> 05:18.187
Glenn Close, Fatal Attraction.

05:18.230 --> 05:19.667
Good one, Ziva.

05:19.710 --> 05:23.105
Your impression of
"hot lady with crazy eyes"

05:23.148 --> 05:25.542
is dead on, by the way.

05:25.586 --> 05:27.239
You are a, uh,

05:27.283 --> 05:29.067
sphinx of a minx.

05:31.635 --> 05:34.159
Game time fellas,
just like we planned it.

05:34.203 --> 05:35.813
Tony, do not try
to talk your way

05:35.857 --> 05:37.075
out of this by calling me hot.

05:37.119 --> 05:39.121
McGEE: He also called
you crazy, Ziva.

05:39.164 --> 05:41.384
ZIVA:
Ooh, I will unleash crazy on him

05:41.428 --> 05:42.777
if he does not apologize

05:42.820 --> 05:44.431
for leaving me
out of the loop.

05:44.474 --> 05:47.129
JARVIS:
That won't be necessary,
Special Agent David.

05:47.172 --> 05:50.915
Today was phase one of
a joint PsyOps/NCIS directive--

05:50.959 --> 05:53.614
a staged assassination
attempt of yours truly.

05:53.657 --> 05:54.658
So that's where you were.

05:54.702 --> 05:56.921
Welcome to the need to know.

05:56.965 --> 06:00.011
Target is Phillip J. Wickes of
Wickes Steel & Shipbuilding.

06:00.055 --> 06:02.797
I want it known that Phillip
Wickes is a personal friend.

06:02.840 --> 06:04.755
I signed off on this op
under the condition that

06:04.799 --> 06:06.540
we look just as hard
for his innocence

06:06.583 --> 06:08.193
as we do for his guilt.
Understood?

06:08.237 --> 06:09.194
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.

06:09.238 --> 06:11.153
Director Vance.

06:14.461 --> 06:17.420
One week ago, a page from a

06:17.464 --> 06:19.901
highly classified file
surfaced online.

06:19.944 --> 06:22.773
That same day,
SECNAV got a love letter

06:22.817 --> 06:25.689
demanding that he put the brakes
on the Navy's green initiative

06:25.733 --> 06:27.865
which is to build all new subs
and ships

06:27.909 --> 06:29.911
with lighter,
alternative materials.

06:29.954 --> 06:31.478
TONY:
If the SECNAV refuses to play,

06:31.521 --> 06:34.089
the e-mail threatens to release
more pages from the file.

06:34.132 --> 06:35.525
It's straight-up blackmail.

06:35.569 --> 06:37.048
What is in this
document, Director?

06:37.092 --> 06:40.791
The file was remotely lifted
from a database at AUTEC.

06:40.835 --> 06:42.489
That's the the Atlantic...

06:42.532 --> 06:44.621
Atlantic Undersea Test
and Evaluation Center.

06:44.665 --> 06:47.407
It's a facility where
they test military technology.

06:47.450 --> 06:49.713
Unmanned
submersible drones,

06:49.757 --> 06:51.019
Mk-48 torpedo
simulators...

06:51.062 --> 06:52.890
Easy, McBradbury.

06:52.934 --> 06:54.805
The file details
a simulated warfare test

06:54.849 --> 06:56.633
done at AUTEC.

06:56.677 --> 06:58.200
First page, no context,

06:58.243 --> 07:00.811
but you throw in a couple more,
suddenly you're announcing

07:00.855 --> 07:03.248
the weaknesses of every port
on the Eastern seaboard.

07:03.292 --> 07:05.512
Cyber division couldn't ID
the source of the breach

07:05.555 --> 07:07.688
in AUTEC's firewall,
but they did tell us

07:07.731 --> 07:10.865
the blackmail message
was e-mailed from...

07:10.908 --> 07:12.475
Wickes Steel.

07:12.519 --> 07:15.739
Last month, the Navy said that
they were done with Wickes.

07:15.783 --> 07:18.481
Good-bye government contracts,
hello bankruptcy.

07:18.525 --> 07:20.178
So, the blackmailer
is Phillip Wickes?

07:20.222 --> 07:21.702
GIBBS:
It's his company.

07:21.745 --> 07:23.268
He's got a pretty good motive.But how is pretending

07:23.312 --> 07:25.488
to shoot SECNAV going to lead us
to our blackmailer?

07:25.532 --> 07:27.664
RYAN:
Seeing his childhood
friend shot,

07:27.708 --> 07:30.798
Wickes is highly vulnerable.

07:30.841 --> 07:33.191
The idea is to tell him that
we've connected the shooting

07:33.235 --> 07:34.845
to Wickes Steel and AUTEC.

07:34.889 --> 07:36.891
If Wickes is part of this
blackmail, then he's going

07:36.934 --> 07:39.284
to want to know why
his people pulled the trigger.

07:39.328 --> 07:41.765
Eyes and ears
on this guy 24/7.

07:41.809 --> 07:44.376
Anyone he connects with
is a suspect.

07:44.420 --> 07:45.943
What if Wickes isn't involved?

07:45.987 --> 07:47.510
Oh, he'll tell us something,

07:47.554 --> 07:50.557
even if he doesn't intend to.

07:50.600 --> 07:53.777
Got your earpiece.

07:53.821 --> 07:56.867
No, I don't need you
in my ear, Doc.

07:56.911 --> 07:58.956
[chuckles] You know
what you need.

07:59.000 --> 07:59.957
Oh, yes I do.

08:00.001 --> 08:01.176
Really?

08:01.219 --> 08:03.091
Yeah.Hey,

08:03.134 --> 08:04.571
you think you
don't need me,

08:04.614 --> 08:06.616
Agent Gibbs,
but you're wrong.

08:06.660 --> 08:08.836
But now I'm curious.

08:08.879 --> 08:11.491
What do you need?

08:11.534 --> 08:15.930
Well, that question
works both ways.

08:15.973 --> 08:18.541
I need you to go in there,

08:18.585 --> 08:21.022
and man-to-man,
establish a bond with Wickes.

08:21.065 --> 08:22.937
I need you to say

08:22.980 --> 08:24.852
what I tell you,
when I tell you.

08:24.895 --> 08:28.595
I need to study Wickes'
language, his body,

08:28.638 --> 08:31.249
and most importantly,
his limbic, physical response

08:31.293 --> 08:33.295
the first time he hears
the word AUTEC.

08:33.338 --> 08:35.210
And from that,
I need to decide

08:35.253 --> 08:36.864
whether or not he's involved.

08:36.907 --> 08:39.954
Hmm, usually I just get
'em to say they did it.

08:39.997 --> 08:41.999
It's easier.

08:42.957 --> 08:44.567
Breakfast the other night,

08:44.611 --> 08:48.397
did I or did I not deduce
that you like powdered sugar

08:48.440 --> 08:50.704
and not syrup on your pancakes

08:50.747 --> 08:55.143
before the pancakes were ordered
without you saying one word?

08:58.276 --> 09:01.105
I rest my case.

09:03.368 --> 09:06.023
His hat was definitely blue.

09:06.067 --> 09:07.242
I...

09:07.285 --> 09:10.637
I wrote in my notes, uh,[sighs]

09:10.680 --> 09:13.074
more royal, than navy.

09:13.117 --> 09:14.466
I think that's correct.

09:14.510 --> 09:17.818
Oh, don't tell me
you can't last longer than this.

09:19.602 --> 09:21.038
GIBBS:
We've been at this
a long time, Mr. Wickes.

09:21.082 --> 09:23.040
It's unfair to see a

09:23.084 --> 09:25.695
guy go through this for over two
hours with nothing in return.

09:25.739 --> 09:28.263
I want to help
all that I can.

09:28.306 --> 09:30.178
See, he's a giver.

09:30.221 --> 09:32.876
Okay, keep 'em rolling.
Repeat after me:

09:32.920 --> 09:35.009
How many employees
from your company

09:35.052 --> 09:36.532
were aware
of today's symposium?

09:36.576 --> 09:38.403
A lot of your people
know about this thing today?

09:38.447 --> 09:40.884
WICKES:
Yes. Why?

09:40.928 --> 09:42.669
Are you suggesting that

09:42.712 --> 09:43.974
someone from my company
could be involved?

09:44.018 --> 09:46.237
No, tell him it's unlikely.

09:46.281 --> 09:47.543
Make him your friend first.

09:47.587 --> 09:49.327
We'll get to that later.
Tell him.

09:49.371 --> 09:50.633
Not likely.

09:52.069 --> 09:53.984
Wickes Steel is
going through a...

09:54.028 --> 09:55.638
[sighs]
pretty tough time.

09:55.682 --> 09:58.032
But we'll push through,
I mean, this

09:58.075 --> 10:00.077
company was built
on simple pride.

10:00.121 --> 10:03.124
My grandfather started
with an idea.

10:03.167 --> 10:04.865
My father worked there
till the day he died.

10:04.908 --> 10:07.911
The old man loved
his female employees.

10:07.955 --> 10:09.696
I have more relatives
and half-relatives

10:09.739 --> 10:11.654
working for me
than you can imagine.

10:11.698 --> 10:13.134
[chuckles]

10:13.177 --> 10:14.962
What am I talking about?

10:15.005 --> 10:16.877
This is about Clayton.

10:16.920 --> 10:18.574
Even though I was older,

10:18.618 --> 10:20.445
he always looked
out for me.

10:20.489 --> 10:22.491
We use to call
him the Mayor.

10:22.534 --> 10:23.797
[sighs]

10:23.840 --> 10:26.060
I just want to see him
pull through this.

10:26.103 --> 10:29.019
RYAN:
It's okay, let him go.

10:29.063 --> 10:31.805
Gibbs, Gibbs,
let him come back to you.[sighs]

10:31.848 --> 10:33.328
Just be patient.

10:33.371 --> 10:35.069
Think about something else.

10:35.112 --> 10:37.071
The sweater I wore to your house
the other night,

10:37.114 --> 10:38.681
what color was it?

10:38.725 --> 10:39.900
I know you remember.

10:39.943 --> 10:42.990
No! No, no... [sighs]

10:43.033 --> 10:44.992
We think the shooter

10:45.035 --> 10:46.689
has a connection to AUTEC.

10:46.733 --> 10:48.648
You know what AUTEC is,
Mr. Wicke?

10:50.519 --> 10:52.956
I do.

10:53.000 --> 10:56.743
A lot of unhappy folks
from your company knew exactly

10:56.786 --> 10:58.745
where SECNAV was gonna be today.

10:58.788 --> 11:01.051
Do any of them

11:01.095 --> 11:03.706
have a connection
to AUTEC projects?

11:04.751 --> 11:07.188
Lawrence Ridgeway.

11:07.231 --> 11:10.278
He wasn't the man
with the gun, but...

11:10.321 --> 11:12.280
Details.

11:12.323 --> 11:13.977
[sighs]

11:14.021 --> 11:16.763
Wickes built something for AUTEC
back in the '70s.

11:16.806 --> 11:19.156
Before my time.

11:19.200 --> 11:22.159
Ridgeway was the only one
still around that worked on it.

11:22.203 --> 11:24.640
Last month, I had
to lay him off,

11:24.684 --> 11:26.947
two weeks shy
of retirement.

11:26.990 --> 11:30.777
Lawrence did not take it well.

11:34.606 --> 11:36.130
What the hell
was that?

11:36.173 --> 11:38.001
Doc, I don't have all year
to figure this out.

11:38.045 --> 11:39.916
I told you I needed
to study Wickes.

11:39.960 --> 11:41.570
You just watched him
for two hours.
Yes.

11:41.613 --> 11:44.138
And then you blocked my
view at the critical moment.

11:44.181 --> 11:45.443
First mention of AUTEC,

11:45.487 --> 11:48.011
all I saw was the back
of your big fat head.

11:48.055 --> 11:51.014
I can't even confirm now that he
was involved in the blackmail.

11:51.058 --> 11:52.233
Looks like Ridgeway might be.

11:52.276 --> 11:54.235
Oh, you think Wickes
was rattled enough

11:54.278 --> 11:56.106
to give up a partner
just like that?

11:56.150 --> 11:58.239
Or he's just telling us
what he knows,

11:58.282 --> 12:00.502
and he's innocent.

12:00.545 --> 12:02.417
I didn't try
to block your view.

12:02.460 --> 12:06.073
I didn't try
to ruin anything.

12:06.116 --> 12:08.902
That's it? Is that all
you have to say?
No.

12:09.946 --> 12:12.253
Lawrence Ridgeway.

12:14.124 --> 12:16.213
TONY:
Say hello to Lawrence Ridgeway.

12:16.257 --> 12:17.737
A spry 62,
and loving it.

12:17.780 --> 12:18.912
Third-generation

12:18.955 --> 12:20.304
steelworker,

12:20.348 --> 12:22.045
hired at Wickes Steel
when he was just a kid.

12:22.089 --> 12:23.873
Dedicated employee,

12:23.917 --> 12:25.266
sort of like yours truly.
By the way,

12:25.309 --> 12:27.485
I want to thank you
for allowing me to participate

12:27.529 --> 12:29.139
in the SECNAV op.Thank the Doc.

12:29.183 --> 12:30.793
She's the one who chose you.

12:30.837 --> 12:33.361
Yeah, I thought your
game show host quality

12:33.404 --> 12:35.493
would be good
for the stage.Ziva?

12:35.537 --> 12:36.799
ZIVA:
Ridgeway has
had a rough year.

12:36.843 --> 12:38.148
Lost thousands in company stock,

12:38.192 --> 12:39.802
he was recently laid off,

12:39.846 --> 12:42.457
and if Wickes Steel goes under,
he will likely lose his pension.

12:42.500 --> 12:44.024
SECNAV's green plan
ruined this guy.

12:44.067 --> 12:45.373
Sounds like
a motive to me.

12:45.416 --> 12:46.809
McGEE:
If Ridgeway did it, he had help.

12:46.853 --> 12:48.202
There's no way he's got

12:48.245 --> 12:50.204
the skills to break through
AUTEC's firewall.

12:50.247 --> 12:52.423
I found a post
of his on a PC

12:52.467 --> 12:54.034
forum asking what a cookie is.

12:54.077 --> 12:56.079
[laughs]
Old people.

12:56.123 --> 12:57.428
Old people entertain me.

12:57.472 --> 12:59.300
I can tell you
Wickes didn't have

12:59.343 --> 13:00.780
the know-how to pull off
this AUTEC job, either.

13:00.823 --> 13:02.042
I think we're looking at a team.

13:02.085 --> 13:03.521
So you determined
from the interview

13:03.565 --> 13:04.827
that Wickes is involved?

13:07.264 --> 13:08.483
[clears throat]

13:08.526 --> 13:10.790
My findings were inconclusive.

13:10.833 --> 13:12.617
GIBBS:
Any contact between
Wickes and Ridgeway?

13:12.661 --> 13:14.184
Not a peep out of Wickes
since we let him go.

13:14.228 --> 13:16.230
Wickes is a chess player.

13:16.273 --> 13:17.797
It doesn't surprise me

13:17.840 --> 13:20.060
that he's taking some time
before he makes his next move.

13:20.103 --> 13:21.713
McGee, get me
a location on Ridgeway.

13:21.757 --> 13:22.584
On it.

13:22.627 --> 13:23.585
DiNozzo, Ziva, get going.

13:23.628 --> 13:25.848
Oh, um,
instead of

13:25.892 --> 13:27.110
Wink Martindale here,

13:27.154 --> 13:28.633
I think I'd like
to send Elliott.

13:28.677 --> 13:29.765
TONY:
Wink?

13:29.809 --> 13:31.375
Come on, at least
go Chuck Woolery.

13:31.419 --> 13:33.377
No, let me at him. I'm the king
of non-verbal indicators.

13:33.421 --> 13:34.596
Yes, he is.

13:34.639 --> 13:38.208
Unless, of course,
somebody blocks his view.

13:38.252 --> 13:39.427
GIBBS:
Ziva,

13:39.470 --> 13:41.908
take Elliott with
you. Come on.

13:41.951 --> 13:43.300
[whispers]:
Game show host.

13:45.215 --> 13:47.609
Did you see that?

13:47.652 --> 13:50.003
Is she serious about this
whole game show host thing?

13:50.046 --> 13:51.700
Oh, the doc does not mess around

13:51.743 --> 13:53.571
when it comes
to peoples' personality traits.

13:53.615 --> 13:55.356
Gibbs smiled at her.

13:55.399 --> 13:58.185
I saw it. And the way he walked
to the elevator-- it was...

13:58.228 --> 14:00.100
It was what?

14:00.143 --> 14:03.190
Bouncy. Gibbs' walk

14:03.233 --> 14:05.366
definitely had a bounce to it.

14:05.409 --> 14:07.107
Yeah, happy feet. I saw it.

14:07.150 --> 14:09.500
Feet are the most honest part
of a human's body.

14:09.544 --> 14:11.154
Eyes are not bad indicators,
as well.

14:11.198 --> 14:12.547
I saw Ryan's dilate

14:12.590 --> 14:14.766
when Gibbs walked
into her office the other day.

14:14.810 --> 14:17.378
So, what do you think
this means?

14:17.421 --> 14:19.075
Oh, interest, excitement,
you know.

14:19.119 --> 14:20.294
It's a neurovascular response.

14:20.337 --> 14:22.339
The fact is, the
only one who knows

14:22.383 --> 14:24.646
what a person is thinking is
the person who's thinking it.

14:24.689 --> 14:26.604
I thought you PsyOps agents
could interpret everything.No.

14:26.648 --> 14:28.868
And even if we could,
we wouldn't tell you.

14:28.911 --> 14:30.521
Mm. So, Dr. Ryan-- is she...?

14:30.565 --> 14:31.958
The best.

14:32.001 --> 14:33.960
The annoying big
sister I never had.

14:34.003 --> 14:36.527
I'd do anything for her, and if
Gibbs hurts her, I'll kill him.

14:36.571 --> 14:38.051
[laughs]

14:38.094 --> 14:39.313
Oh, sorry.
I shoot straight,

14:39.356 --> 14:40.618
and hope
that it'll be tempered

14:40.662 --> 14:42.403
by my teddy-bear
cuteness.
Uh-huh.

14:42.446 --> 14:45.449
Bullet hole
through the window.

14:59.289 --> 15:01.204
Clear.

15:01.248 --> 15:02.423
Clear.

15:02.466 --> 15:05.252
Well, that's Ridgeway.

15:05.295 --> 15:07.384
Looks like he's been
dead a few days.

15:07.428 --> 15:09.386
What else do you
see, Mr. Observant?

15:12.346 --> 15:14.261
This guy's not gonna be
painting anytime soon.

15:14.304 --> 15:16.480
He's not gonna be answering
any questions, either.

15:24.967 --> 15:27.448
Dr. Ryan,

15:27.491 --> 15:31.147
from the moment
Jethro first mentioned your name

15:31.191 --> 15:33.062
and told me of
your passion

15:33.106 --> 15:35.543
for the inner workings
of the human mind,

15:35.586 --> 15:37.545
I knew I had found

15:37.588 --> 15:38.763
a kindred spirit.Kindred spirit.

15:38.807 --> 15:40.678
That's exactly what
I was gonna to say.

15:41.636 --> 15:42.637
Plenty of time
for spirits

15:42.680 --> 15:43.855
later, Duck?

15:43.899 --> 15:44.944
Ah. Thank
you, Jethro.

15:44.987 --> 15:46.119
Ever diligent

15:46.162 --> 15:47.555
in the war on small talk.

15:47.598 --> 15:50.166
Single gunshot
wound to the chest.

15:50.210 --> 15:52.560
The bullet pierced
the sternum,

15:52.603 --> 15:55.519
headed straight through
the dorsal side,

15:55.563 --> 15:58.131
and lodged itself
in an adjacent wall.

15:58.174 --> 16:01.308
Happily, it is now
in the capable hands

16:01.351 --> 16:02.396
of Miss Sciuto.

16:02.439 --> 16:03.614
GIBBS:
That it?

16:03.658 --> 16:05.616
Well, based on the
rate of decomposition,

16:05.660 --> 16:10.621
he expired approximately 72
hours prior to discovery.

16:10.665 --> 16:11.840
GIBBS:
Before we started
playing Wickes.

16:11.883 --> 16:13.581
Oh, please.

16:14.625 --> 16:16.453
Mr. Ridgeway.

16:16.497 --> 16:18.586
Do you mind
if I call you Larry?

16:18.629 --> 16:20.936
[whispers]:
Ooh, I like this woman.

16:20.980 --> 16:23.504
So, Elliott tells me
you never saw the bullet coming,

16:23.547 --> 16:25.462
and that you were
getting ready to paint.

16:25.506 --> 16:28.596
So, let's just say

16:28.639 --> 16:30.424
you were involved in a plot

16:30.467 --> 16:32.556
to blackmail the
Secretary of the Navy.

16:32.600 --> 16:33.775
You with me, Larr?

16:33.818 --> 16:35.472
Is brightening up the den

16:35.516 --> 16:37.692
really the top
of your priority list?

16:37.735 --> 16:40.651
I'm pretty sure that
Larr-bear here wasn't involved.

16:40.695 --> 16:42.349
I think he just knew something

16:42.392 --> 16:44.220
that someone didn't want him
telling us.

16:44.264 --> 16:46.005
[whispers]:
She's phenomenal.

16:46.048 --> 16:48.355
But can she make
assumptions like this?

16:48.398 --> 16:49.747
She just did, Duck.

16:49.791 --> 16:52.707
[phone rings]

16:52.750 --> 16:54.448
Yeah, Abbs.

16:54.491 --> 16:55.710
In my lab.I'm on my way.

16:55.753 --> 16:58.365
"War on small talk." Classic.

17:01.542 --> 17:03.544
Impressive.

17:03.587 --> 17:05.850
Gibbs! Gibbs!
Gibbs! Gibbs!

17:05.894 --> 17:07.548
Look, I know
that McGee thinks

17:07.591 --> 17:09.637
that AUTEC is just a
military facility,

17:09.680 --> 17:11.508
but I have possible proof

17:11.552 --> 17:13.554
of an actual
sighting of a USO.

17:13.597 --> 17:15.643
That's an Unidentified
Submerged Object.

17:15.686 --> 17:17.340
Oh. Hello.

17:17.384 --> 17:19.560
Hello. I'm Dr. Samantha...

17:19.603 --> 17:21.344
Ryan. I know.

17:21.388 --> 17:23.694
So, what am I thinking?

17:23.738 --> 17:25.218
You're thinking I can't

17:25.261 --> 17:26.741
possibly know
what you're thinking.

17:26.784 --> 17:28.090
You're good.

17:28.134 --> 17:30.658
Abby. Come on.
What do you got?

17:30.701 --> 17:32.747
A lot. AUTEC is,
like, crazy amazing.

17:32.790 --> 17:34.879
You've got your
Bermuda Triangle,

17:34.923 --> 17:38.100
your wormholes, you've got
your magnetic field deviations.

17:38.144 --> 17:40.450
Just wish there was a
way to contain it all.

17:40.494 --> 17:41.756
You're a mapper.

17:41.799 --> 17:44.889
Oh. I'm warning you.

17:44.933 --> 17:47.240
You should get out of my head

17:47.283 --> 17:48.719
while you still can.

17:48.763 --> 17:50.591
Can you map the bullet
back to the shooter?

17:50.634 --> 17:51.809
Slug that
killed Ridgeway,

17:51.853 --> 17:53.376
it's 30-caliber,
definitely unusual.

17:53.420 --> 17:55.683
The one thing I do know is
that it's not military specs.

17:55.726 --> 17:57.685
I'm still trying
to track it back

17:57.728 --> 17:59.556
to the exact weapon
it was fired from.

17:59.600 --> 18:00.818
Track faster, Abbs.

18:00.862 --> 18:03.256
You know why
you're so gruff all the time?

18:03.299 --> 18:04.474
You need more sex.

18:04.518 --> 18:05.693
I'm not answering that.

18:05.736 --> 18:07.086
You just did.

18:09.697 --> 18:12.352
I am telling you, I saw
a bounce in his step.

18:12.395 --> 18:14.702
And Elliott... Elliott was sure
about Ryan's pupils, as well.

18:14.745 --> 18:16.921
How am I gonna survive
Gibbs dating a woman

18:16.965 --> 18:18.749
who thinks I'm a
game show host?

18:18.793 --> 18:21.012
What does that even mean?
Does she think I'm cheesy?

18:21.056 --> 18:22.318
That I like
pencil-thin microphones?

18:22.362 --> 18:24.755
See, I don't buy it.
Gibbs is a lone wolf.

18:24.799 --> 18:26.061
You have to
be observant.

18:26.105 --> 18:28.150
Next time they come in
here, you need to open

18:28.194 --> 18:29.804
your eyes
and really look.

18:29.847 --> 18:32.154
GIBBS:
Okay, what are we looking at?

18:33.460 --> 18:35.723
Updates on Ridgeway's
shooter.

18:35.766 --> 18:36.898
Go.

18:36.941 --> 18:38.204
Ridgeway was shot
three days ago.

18:38.247 --> 18:40.119
Ryan's had eyes on Wickes
for the last week.

18:40.162 --> 18:41.772
He wasn't the triggerman.

18:41.816 --> 18:43.122
Well, he could have
ordered it earlier.

18:43.165 --> 18:44.819
McGee, e-mails?

18:44.862 --> 18:46.777
Wickes has contacted
three people

18:46.821 --> 18:48.736
since we suggested
the AUTEC

18:48.779 --> 18:50.651
connection
to the SECNAV's shooting.

18:50.694 --> 18:52.870
ZIVA:
Bob "Smitty" Smith,
Ronald Ostrowski,

18:52.914 --> 18:54.524
and Vice President
Frank Satner.

18:54.568 --> 18:55.830
TONY:
All haunt

18:55.873 --> 18:56.874
the Wickes Steel boardroom.

18:56.918 --> 18:58.354
Whole lot of motive
going on.

18:58.398 --> 18:59.660
Working to clear
their backgrounds,

18:59.703 --> 19:01.705
but so far,
all talks have been

19:01.749 --> 19:02.619
work-related and clean.

19:02.663 --> 19:03.925
Look for codes.
Yeah.

19:03.968 --> 19:06.884
And cross-reference keywords
with recent e-mails.

19:06.928 --> 19:09.800
Whoever shot Ridgeway wanted
to keep him quiet for a reason.

19:09.844 --> 19:11.498
Could be this.

19:11.541 --> 19:13.152
Report detailing the project

19:13.195 --> 19:14.805
Ridgeway worked on for AUTEC.

19:14.849 --> 19:16.242
Well, it's
been redacted.

19:16.285 --> 19:18.026
Yeah.

19:19.070 --> 19:21.247
Can we get access?

19:21.290 --> 19:22.857
Mm. Won't be a cakewalk.

19:22.900 --> 19:24.119
Leads on the AUTEC hacker?

19:24.163 --> 19:24.859
Whoever he is,

19:24.902 --> 19:26.077
he's good.

19:26.121 --> 19:27.253
Hid his IP
behind a wall

19:27.296 --> 19:28.950
of alternating
secure servers.

19:28.993 --> 19:31.126
We need to get in this report.

19:32.171 --> 19:34.564
Okay.

19:36.262 --> 19:38.220
RYAN:
Bad news. There's more

19:38.264 --> 19:40.744
red tape around that thing
than I have ever seen.

19:40.788 --> 19:42.964
The good news is,
I have a talent

19:43.007 --> 19:45.706
for badgering people
until they give me what I need.

19:45.749 --> 19:47.882
Hard to believe.

19:47.925 --> 19:50.667
Wickes is lying low
for a reason.

19:50.711 --> 19:53.844
I think he eliminated
the only remaining connection

19:53.888 --> 19:55.846
between his company and AUTEC.

19:55.890 --> 19:58.849
I think he saw us
snooping around.

19:58.893 --> 20:00.721
I think he sent us straight
to Ridgeway's door.

20:00.764 --> 20:02.853
I mean, who would
suspect him?
You.

20:02.897 --> 20:07.380
[phone chimes]

20:07.423 --> 20:09.077
Your son?

20:10.557 --> 20:13.908
You're not the only one
who can spot a tell, Doc.

20:15.344 --> 20:17.259
Parker's a funny kid.

20:17.303 --> 20:19.870
He's trying to wrangle
fast food out of my sister.

20:19.914 --> 20:22.133
[laughs]
No.

20:22.177 --> 20:24.745
You got pictures?

20:24.788 --> 20:27.965
Your surveillance pictures
weren't good enough?

20:28.009 --> 20:29.619
By the way, bad of me.

20:45.809 --> 20:48.290
Well, that's not the kind of
Kodak moment I was thinking.

20:48.334 --> 20:49.509
[laughs]

20:49.552 --> 20:52.120
He was just little
when he gave it to me.

20:54.688 --> 20:56.646
He used to love boats

20:56.690 --> 20:59.519
almost as much as you do.

20:59.562 --> 21:02.217
He said it was the two of us,

21:02.261 --> 21:04.480
and that we were
on this boat,

21:04.524 --> 21:08.528
sailing away, happy.

21:14.360 --> 21:16.449
He wanted to take you away.

21:19.147 --> 21:21.149
Who's playing doctor now?

21:21.192 --> 21:23.194
[phone ringing]

21:24.718 --> 21:25.893
Yeah, McGee.

21:25.936 --> 21:27.764
Boss, I finally got the IP

21:27.808 --> 21:29.897
for the computer used
to hack into AUTEC.

21:29.940 --> 21:33.292
Belongs to a government
consultant named Amanda Baylor.

21:33.335 --> 21:35.946
So that's our computer genius?

21:35.990 --> 21:37.992
An encryption specialist.

21:38.035 --> 21:40.473
And you are never gonna believe
where she works.

21:40.516 --> 21:42.518
[whirring, rhythmic beeping]

21:45.042 --> 21:46.305
[tires screech]

21:46.348 --> 21:49.046
Yes, I can confirm
that one Amanda Baylor

21:49.090 --> 21:50.918
is in the hiz-ouse.

21:50.961 --> 21:52.398
Very unattractive,

21:52.441 --> 21:53.834
in case you're wondering.

21:53.877 --> 21:56.140
By the way, are you aware

21:56.184 --> 21:58.142
of a little film
called The Graduate?

21:58.186 --> 21:59.796
Mike Nichols.

21:59.840 --> 22:01.624
Fantastic.

22:01.668 --> 22:03.409
"Would you like me
to seduce you?"

22:03.452 --> 22:05.149
Wait, what?

22:05.193 --> 22:07.021
Were you quoting the
movie or was that real?

22:07.064 --> 22:08.588
Where's Baylor?

22:08.631 --> 22:10.241
Secure encryption room.

22:10.285 --> 22:12.374
She's in the middle
of a 72-hour shift.

22:12.418 --> 22:13.332
Logged in 14.5
hours ago,

22:13.375 --> 22:15.377
before I got here.

22:15.421 --> 22:17.466
Once an encryptor goes in,
they don't come out--

22:17.510 --> 22:18.772
department policy.

22:18.815 --> 22:21.383
Probably well on the way
to being ripe in there.

22:21.427 --> 22:22.428
Did you know
that your hair

22:22.471 --> 22:24.386
sparkles under
these fluorescents?

22:24.430 --> 22:25.387
Really?

22:25.431 --> 22:26.475
How much does it sparkle?

22:26.519 --> 22:27.868
So much.
So much?

22:27.911 --> 22:29.957
So, so much.

22:30.000 --> 22:30.958
Open it.

22:31.001 --> 22:32.002
Can't.

22:32.046 --> 22:33.264
No in, no out.

22:33.308 --> 22:35.397
Encryptors even have
their own private commode.

22:35.441 --> 22:37.051
There's a lot of confidential

22:37.094 --> 22:39.009
crap in there.

22:39.053 --> 22:40.184
Here.

22:40.228 --> 22:43.449
I can make sure you
don't lose your job,

22:43.492 --> 22:44.624
but there might
be something else

22:44.667 --> 22:47.191
we could talk
about you losing.

22:48.236 --> 22:50.847
I've decided to open it.Thank you.

23:03.382 --> 23:04.905
Where is she?

23:04.948 --> 23:07.211
This did not happen
on my watch.

23:07.255 --> 23:10.345
When she clocked in I
was still in my pj's,

23:10.389 --> 23:11.999
jamming to Luther Vandross.

23:13.609 --> 23:16.133
Wow, this is a beautiful setup.

23:16.177 --> 23:18.353
They're running
themselves?

23:18.397 --> 23:20.703
No, Mrs. R.

23:20.747 --> 23:22.531
They're being run remotely.

23:32.367 --> 23:34.891
Amanda Baylor.

23:34.935 --> 23:36.937
Are you there?

23:47.600 --> 23:49.906
ZIVA:
Amanda Baylor, 28,

23:49.950 --> 23:52.431
unmarried,
freelance encryption specialist,

23:52.474 --> 23:54.476
graduated from MIT with a
degree in applied mathematics.

23:54.520 --> 23:56.086
What else?

23:56.130 --> 23:58.045
That's pretty much it, boss.

23:58.088 --> 24:00.047
With the exception of
a few personnel files

24:00.090 --> 24:02.136
from the Iron Crypt, it's
like she doesn't exist.

24:02.179 --> 24:05.052
Well, she existed enough to have
stolen that file from AUTEC

24:05.095 --> 24:06.967
and set up a pretty good alibi.

24:07.010 --> 24:08.577
How often was she
logged in at work

24:08.621 --> 24:09.709
when she wasn't
actually there?

24:09.752 --> 24:10.971
Can we link her
to Phillip Wickes?

24:11.014 --> 24:12.102
We have not been able

24:12.146 --> 24:13.582
to tie Baylor to anyone
at Wickes Steel.

24:13.626 --> 24:15.192
Not even
the board stooges.

24:15.236 --> 24:17.717
Wickes is still only talking
to them and only about

24:17.760 --> 24:18.631
pushing paper.

24:18.674 --> 24:19.675
What about a line

24:19.719 --> 24:20.720
from Amanda Baylor
to our dead guy?

24:20.763 --> 24:21.851
ZIVA:
Baylor does not have a history

24:21.895 --> 24:23.200
with firearms,
but it is still possible

24:23.244 --> 24:24.767
[phone rings]that she shot Ridgeway.

24:24.811 --> 24:26.508
Yeah, Abbs.

24:26.552 --> 24:28.162
Tell her you're on your way.

24:28.205 --> 24:30.730
I'm on my way.

24:35.299 --> 24:36.518
There,

24:36.562 --> 24:39.173
there it is.

24:39.216 --> 24:40.696
I don't see it.

24:40.740 --> 24:41.697
She's right.

24:41.741 --> 24:42.742
There was a bounce.

24:43.786 --> 24:45.788
Damn it.

24:48.008 --> 24:50.140
ABBY:
Welcome to AUTEC

24:50.184 --> 24:51.751
and the surrounding areas
of the Caribbean.

24:51.794 --> 24:52.752
What is this?

24:52.795 --> 24:54.144
The Bermuda Triangle.

24:54.188 --> 24:56.930
And an ode
to my inner mapper.

24:56.973 --> 24:59.410
I'm marking the site
of each and every

24:59.454 --> 25:01.412
amazing thing
that happened here.

25:01.456 --> 25:02.718
Well, you can't
just say that

25:02.762 --> 25:04.328
and not give us a little taste.

25:04.372 --> 25:05.765
I wouldn't dream of it.

25:05.808 --> 25:08.681
Okay, so this bullet marks where

25:08.724 --> 25:10.770
the USS Cyclopsvanished
in the Triangle,

25:10.813 --> 25:12.989
and this bullet is

25:13.033 --> 25:14.338
the Bimini Wall.

25:14.382 --> 25:16.427
It's a possible location
for Atlantis.

25:16.471 --> 25:20.257
And this bullet, Gibbs, this
is the Tongue of the Ocean.

25:20.301 --> 25:21.258
It's like

25:21.302 --> 25:23.217
an underwater Grand Canyon,

25:23.260 --> 25:24.610
and we think

25:24.653 --> 25:26.350
that AUTEC is running cables

25:26.394 --> 25:29.571
down more than 6,000 feet.

25:29.615 --> 25:31.181
To what we don't know.

25:31.225 --> 25:33.357
Any of these bullets
have a point, Abbs?

25:35.751 --> 25:37.231
The bullet that killed Ridgeway.

25:37.274 --> 25:41.365
I traced that back to
a company called Vita Foras.

25:41.409 --> 25:42.366
Vita Foras.

25:42.410 --> 25:43.803
It's Latin.

25:43.846 --> 25:46.545
Rough translation:
"Great Outdoors."

25:46.588 --> 25:48.024
I'd guess
we're looking

25:48.068 --> 25:49.156
at hunting weapons?

25:49.199 --> 25:50.157
You would guess right.

25:50.200 --> 25:51.811
More specifically,
extremely rare

25:51.854 --> 25:53.726
hunting rifles, the kind

25:53.769 --> 25:55.684
that crazy hard-core
collectors would trade.

25:55.728 --> 25:57.730
Hard to track.
Exactly.

25:59.993 --> 26:01.821
Love your
triangle, Abbs.

26:01.864 --> 26:03.605
I... I just have to ask.

26:03.649 --> 26:07.304
You're in the business of
proving things with science.

26:07.348 --> 26:11.613
Why this need to chart
the unexplainable?

26:13.310 --> 26:15.269
Wait, you're in my head, right?

26:15.312 --> 26:16.749
I'm just going

26:16.792 --> 26:19.490
to answer you in my thoughts.

26:21.188 --> 26:22.624
Wow.

26:22.668 --> 26:24.321
I get it.

26:24.365 --> 26:27.411
You are a trip,
Ms. Sciuto.

26:29.762 --> 26:31.851
That's a good thing, right?

26:35.681 --> 26:36.638
[sighs]

26:36.682 --> 26:38.640
What now?

26:38.684 --> 26:40.381
Where is Baylor and
who shot Ridgeway?

26:40.424 --> 26:44.428
Wickes might be able
to tell us if we ask nicely.

26:44.472 --> 26:46.256
I'll ask.

26:46.300 --> 26:49.216
I've seen your nice.

26:49.259 --> 26:50.260
I'm going with you.

26:52.306 --> 26:54.177
You said man-to-man.

26:54.221 --> 26:55.265
Oh.

26:55.309 --> 26:56.658
Right, I'm sorry,
we haven't met.

26:56.702 --> 26:58.181
Hi, I'm Elizabeth Brighton,

26:58.225 --> 26:59.792
SECNAV's public affairs officer

26:59.835 --> 27:02.011
during this time of crisis.

27:02.055 --> 27:05.406
Wickes and I are going to form
a special bond of our own.

27:07.843 --> 27:09.802
[snickers]

27:09.845 --> 27:11.804
GIBBS:
We think she might have
a connection

27:11.847 --> 27:14.371
to whoever shot
the secretary.

27:14.415 --> 27:15.938
You know her?

27:15.982 --> 27:16.939
[sighs]

27:16.983 --> 27:19.420
I don't
recognize her.

27:19.463 --> 27:22.684
Did you talk to
Lawrence Ridgeway?

27:22.728 --> 27:24.817
He's dead.

27:24.860 --> 27:27.384
He was murdered?

27:27.428 --> 27:29.386
Murder weapon was
a hunting rifle.

27:29.430 --> 27:31.475
It's rare.

27:31.519 --> 27:33.303
You know anyone with
something like that?

27:33.347 --> 27:35.436
[phone rings]

27:35.479 --> 27:37.656
WICKES:
No.

27:37.699 --> 27:39.658
Yeah, it's Gibbs.

27:43.313 --> 27:45.141
Do you think she shot
both of them?

27:45.185 --> 27:47.187
We don't know.

27:47.230 --> 27:51.278
As I mentioned, I am
serving as the secretary's

27:51.321 --> 27:53.280
public affairs officer,

27:53.323 --> 27:56.326
and he asked me to thank you
for your help with all of this,

27:56.370 --> 28:00.113
and he wanted me to
pass on a message that

28:00.156 --> 28:04.291
the Mayor was sorry that he
missed your birthday last month.

28:04.334 --> 28:09.122
I, I don't know what to say.

28:10.384 --> 28:13.213
There were complications
with the second surgery.

28:14.823 --> 28:17.173
Nothing more they can do.

28:29.055 --> 28:31.231
VANCE:
An interesting day on
the World Wide Web.

28:31.274 --> 28:34.408
A second helping of
the AUTEC file has been leaked.

28:34.451 --> 28:36.584
Page is a table
of contents

28:36.627 --> 28:38.586
listing all the ports
analyzed in the file.

28:38.629 --> 28:40.893
They're toying with us.

28:40.936 --> 28:43.199
First leak was Baylor, second
one has got to be her, too.

28:43.243 --> 28:45.462
So let's grab her.Working on it.

28:45.506 --> 28:48.248
Work harder, Gibbs, I'm about
to go down as the ass who took

28:48.291 --> 28:49.728
a fake shot in the chest
for nothing.

28:49.771 --> 28:51.120
I think "nothing"
would be

28:51.164 --> 28:53.166
stretching it, sir.

28:58.475 --> 28:59.476
Where'd you get this?

28:59.520 --> 29:00.651
Borrowed it
from Wickes.

29:00.695 --> 29:02.218
He took a good
look at it

29:02.262 --> 29:05.047
right after Gibbs updated
him about your condition.

29:05.091 --> 29:06.483
Well, that
makes sense--

29:06.527 --> 29:08.311
picture of the two
of them together.

29:08.355 --> 29:10.400
He also looked at it
directly after he heard

29:10.444 --> 29:11.401
that Ridgeway was shot

29:11.445 --> 29:13.403
with a rare
hunting rifle.

29:13.447 --> 29:14.404
Can you think

29:14.448 --> 29:15.841
of any possible
connection

29:15.884 --> 29:17.625
between that photo
and a weapon of that type?

29:20.236 --> 29:22.195
Picture was taken
at his family's cabin.

29:22.238 --> 29:23.413
We were on a hunting trip.

29:23.457 --> 29:24.719
Are you gonna try
to tell me

29:24.763 --> 29:27.069
that Wickes was
implicating himself?

29:27.113 --> 29:28.636
Wickes didn't
pull the trigger,

29:28.679 --> 29:30.551
but the rifle could have been
his and so could the hire.

29:30.594 --> 29:33.815
The plan was to monitor
Phillip's communication

29:33.859 --> 29:35.034
after the mention of AUTEC.

29:35.077 --> 29:37.166
You did that,
you came up with nothing.

29:39.952 --> 29:41.780
Sir, there is a
good possibility

29:41.823 --> 29:44.826
that Wickes looking at
this picture was a tell.

29:44.870 --> 29:47.786
I suggest that you press him
further, search his house...

29:47.829 --> 29:49.048
No.

29:49.091 --> 29:50.049
If he's involved...

29:50.092 --> 29:51.702
I said no.

29:51.746 --> 29:52.878
I'm not going to rest

29:52.921 --> 29:55.141
this entire investigation
on a glance.

29:55.184 --> 29:57.317
Maybe he was looking
past the photo,

29:57.360 --> 29:59.536
through the wall,
down the street

29:59.580 --> 30:01.408
to a church to ask God
what in the hell he did

30:01.451 --> 30:02.801
to deserve this torture.

30:02.844 --> 30:05.891
What then,
Dr. Ryan?

30:05.934 --> 30:07.936
I'm done.

30:07.980 --> 30:09.720
Get Wickes
in here.

30:11.287 --> 30:13.289
Now.

30:20.906 --> 30:23.909
[over speaker]:
Agent Gibbs, why am I here?

30:23.952 --> 30:25.954
[sighing]

30:31.568 --> 30:33.527
[sighing]

30:33.570 --> 30:35.877
[door opens]

30:35.921 --> 30:38.401
Clayton?

30:38.445 --> 30:41.230
My God.

30:41.274 --> 30:43.885
Bad information, Phil.

30:43.929 --> 30:45.147
They got it wrong.

30:45.191 --> 30:46.235
I'm sorry.

30:46.279 --> 30:49.543
No, no, I-I'm,
I'm just so...

30:49.586 --> 30:51.850
JARVIS:
Someone is trying
to blackmail me,

30:51.893 --> 30:54.983
blackmail
the United States Navy.

30:55.027 --> 30:58.334
Phil, they
think it's you.

30:58.378 --> 30:59.596
Are you involved?

31:02.295 --> 31:04.645
No.

31:06.952 --> 31:10.129
He believes him.

31:10.172 --> 31:12.958
You?

31:13.001 --> 31:15.003
Yes.

31:18.093 --> 31:19.616
[door opens]

31:31.933 --> 31:34.718
[sighs]

31:38.766 --> 31:40.724
Wickes say
anything else?

31:40.768 --> 31:43.597
He signed a
nondisclosure agreement.

31:43.640 --> 31:46.295
Oh, so he's being
cooperative?

31:46.339 --> 31:48.471
Is that why
you came down here?

31:48.515 --> 31:50.865
No, I came to see
what you were doing.

31:50.909 --> 31:52.911
You mean you came
to gloat.

31:52.954 --> 31:57.741
Oh, come on, Gibbs,
don't make me do it for you.

31:57.785 --> 31:59.656
You thought
Wickes was innocent

31:59.700 --> 32:01.658
the minute you left
that first interview,

32:01.702 --> 32:04.313
and based on the lack of
evidence we have against him

32:04.357 --> 32:07.664
and the indicators in the room
with Jarvis, you were right.

32:07.708 --> 32:09.666
We need to focus
on Baylor.
No, no,

32:09.710 --> 32:11.103
you need to say it.

32:11.146 --> 32:12.974
We all thought he might
be clean; none of us knew

32:13.018 --> 32:15.977
for sure.
I knew for sure.

32:16.021 --> 32:17.065
That's why you need
to say it.

32:17.109 --> 32:19.894
Say what?
That I was wrong,
Gibbs,

32:19.938 --> 32:23.332
and I'm never wrong.

32:23.376 --> 32:26.727
And today of all days,
I was wrong.

32:26.770 --> 32:29.121
Today, Doc, is as
good a day as any.

32:29.164 --> 32:30.426
[chuckles]

32:30.470 --> 32:31.819
No, it's not.

32:31.862 --> 32:34.865
I keep telling myself

32:34.909 --> 32:38.260
Wickes looked
at this picture for a reason,

32:38.304 --> 32:40.784
but he didn't.

32:40.828 --> 32:44.875
Not once have I thought
this man anything but guilty.

32:46.355 --> 32:48.792
[scoffs]
What kind of person
does that make me?

32:48.836 --> 32:50.490
Human.

32:50.533 --> 32:52.796
ELLIOTT:
Hey, Doc, your black belt

32:52.840 --> 32:54.711
in badgering people
pays off once again.

32:54.755 --> 32:56.583
Ridgeway's AUTEC report

32:56.626 --> 32:57.888
sans redactions.

32:57.932 --> 33:00.065
You find anything?In the late '70s,

33:00.108 --> 33:03.155
Ridgeway was paid to keep quiet
about a classified technology

33:03.198 --> 33:05.026
he inadvertently saw
while at AUTEC.

33:05.070 --> 33:07.898
The report says the government
paid dozens of people off.

33:07.942 --> 33:08.987
Cash makes people forget.

33:09.030 --> 33:10.031
Yeah, well,

33:10.075 --> 33:11.772
for 500K, I'd keep quiet, too,

33:11.815 --> 33:14.818
even if I did see
little green men on a destroyer.

33:14.862 --> 33:17.865
Anyway, Ridgeway knew the
money came from a pool

33:17.908 --> 33:20.041
of government funds
used for AUTEC payoffs.

33:20.085 --> 33:22.391
It's a off-books account that
hasn't been touched in decades.

33:22.435 --> 33:24.524
But this money
has been accruing interest?

33:25.351 --> 33:26.830
How much money?

33:26.874 --> 33:28.745
TONY:
$327 million and change.

33:28.789 --> 33:30.834
Boss, I'm seeing
multiple attempts

33:30.878 --> 33:32.793
to hack into this account
over the last week.

33:32.836 --> 33:34.012
It's got to be Amanda Baylor.

33:34.055 --> 33:36.318
Baylor was hired
to steal the AUTEC file

33:36.362 --> 33:37.493
andthis money?

33:37.537 --> 33:38.886
Blackmail was a diversion.

33:38.929 --> 33:39.974
It explains why they never

33:40.018 --> 33:41.019
really said anything
that hurt us.

33:41.062 --> 33:42.716
We're watching
the AUTEC files,

33:42.759 --> 33:43.934
they have
a better shot

33:43.978 --> 33:45.849
getting in and out
of the bank account

33:45.893 --> 33:47.025
undetected.

33:47.068 --> 33:49.027
It's all about
the Benjamins.

33:49.070 --> 33:50.376
Well, it looks like
Baylor's taking another

33:50.419 --> 33:51.855
stab at the account right now.

33:51.899 --> 33:53.944
She's accessing remotely,
and she didn't bother burying

33:53.988 --> 33:55.729
her IP so deep this time.

33:55.772 --> 33:57.600
She did not expect us
to look for her there.

33:59.254 --> 34:00.342
Right, I got her.

34:00.386 --> 34:01.909
Getting a Wi-Fi ping.

34:01.952 --> 34:03.084
Ziva, DiNozzo, go...

34:03.128 --> 34:04.955
She's just off the I-95.

34:04.999 --> 34:06.957
I'm texting you the coordinates.

34:08.089 --> 34:10.787
Are you sure
this is the place?

34:10.831 --> 34:12.354
Well, what happened?

34:12.398 --> 34:16.271
You don't trust
the, uh, authority of McMaps?

34:16.315 --> 34:17.664
[truck horn blows nearby]

34:17.707 --> 34:19.361
[whispering]:
All right.

34:19.405 --> 34:22.234
It's like Silence of the Lambs
meets Scooby-Doo.

34:24.062 --> 34:25.150
Freeze! Hands up!

34:26.194 --> 34:29.067
Do I look like I'm running?

34:29.110 --> 34:32.374
Amanda Baylor, you have
the right... [sniffs]

34:32.418 --> 34:33.897
to take a bath.

34:33.941 --> 34:35.638
You smell like
a wild goat.

34:35.682 --> 34:37.553
I've been busy.

34:37.597 --> 34:39.120
Too busy for
personal hygiene?

34:39.164 --> 34:40.382
When I am focused,
I am focused.

34:40.426 --> 34:41.470
You know, McGee like them gamey,

34:41.514 --> 34:43.342
but I'm not sure
he'd go for this one.

34:44.169 --> 34:45.648
Oh, I clean up nice.

34:45.692 --> 34:47.259
Why don't you put the computer
down and step out here?

34:48.303 --> 34:50.175
Let's go,
Animal Kingdom.

34:50.218 --> 34:51.524
Come on.

34:52.829 --> 34:54.744
So, who are you working with?

34:54.788 --> 34:56.659
Ah, um...

34:56.703 --> 34:59.009
I don't know.

34:59.053 --> 35:00.446
Well, we know some stuff

35:00.489 --> 35:02.709
about the blackmail
and about the AUTEC account.

35:02.752 --> 35:05.538
We also know that you're
in cahoots with someone

35:05.581 --> 35:06.582
inside Wickes Steel.

35:06.626 --> 35:08.280
Um...Did you just use

35:08.323 --> 35:09.368
the word cahoots?

35:09.411 --> 35:10.369
I did.

35:10.412 --> 35:11.370
Nice.

35:11.413 --> 35:14.155
All right, somebody hired me,

35:14.199 --> 35:16.244
through Wickes,
but, uh, I don't have a name.

35:16.288 --> 35:17.506
Didn't want one.

35:17.550 --> 35:18.638
Was it Ridgeway?

35:18.681 --> 35:19.813
Did you kill him?

35:19.856 --> 35:21.206
I don't kill people.

35:21.249 --> 35:22.685
I hack.

35:22.729 --> 35:24.731
I haven't really left the van.

35:24.774 --> 35:26.036
No kidding.

35:26.080 --> 35:29.344
Next time, hacker,
why don't you crack a window?

35:33.174 --> 35:35.916
This is all of Baylor's
computer hardware.

35:35.959 --> 35:37.657
No sign of the rifle

35:37.700 --> 35:40.529
used to shoot Ridgeway in
her van or in the apartment.

35:42.227 --> 35:43.750
Abby, you do know

35:43.793 --> 35:46.492
that AUTEC is just a facility
where they run tests, right?

35:46.535 --> 35:49.103
No, Tim, it is a potluck

35:49.147 --> 35:50.757
of the unexplained,

35:50.800 --> 35:53.194
and this scientist is eating
it up; you know why?

35:53.238 --> 35:56.197
Because there's a lot
of really important things

35:56.241 --> 35:57.938
that can't be explained.

35:57.981 --> 36:01.507
Like what, Abbs?Like Atlantis.

36:01.550 --> 36:03.987
Like the disappearance
of the Lady Hampshire.

36:04.031 --> 36:05.902
Like love.

36:05.946 --> 36:07.208
Abbs...

36:07.252 --> 36:08.340
I don't have
anything yet, Gibbs.

36:08.383 --> 36:10.733
The computers just got here.

36:10.777 --> 36:12.605
Well, maybe this stuff
will help.; it's all the files

36:12.648 --> 36:14.215
we've compiled on
the case so far.

36:14.259 --> 36:15.564
What are you doing?

36:15.608 --> 36:16.522
[shutter clicks]

36:16.565 --> 36:18.524
I'm taking a picture

36:18.567 --> 36:19.829
of you with my map.

36:19.873 --> 36:20.961
Trust me,

36:21.004 --> 36:22.267
you will
thank me later.

36:22.310 --> 36:24.051
Oh, I know that look.

36:24.094 --> 36:25.531
I like that look.

36:25.574 --> 36:27.054
The photo of Jarvis and Wickes,

36:27.097 --> 36:30.100
where is it?

36:30.144 --> 36:31.232
Right here, why?

36:34.192 --> 36:36.542
What just happened?

36:39.545 --> 36:42.461
Another unexplained phenomena.

36:42.504 --> 36:45.246
Sometimes,

36:45.290 --> 36:47.422
you just have to believe.

36:49.598 --> 36:51.121
Who took the picture?

36:51.165 --> 36:53.515
Haven't we already done this?

36:53.559 --> 36:54.603
VANCE:
Gibbs,

36:54.647 --> 36:55.691
be careful.

36:55.735 --> 36:57.171
RYAN:
The tell.

36:57.215 --> 36:58.564
Wickes looked at the picture

36:58.607 --> 36:59.869
because of who was
behind the camera,

36:59.913 --> 37:01.044
not in front of it.

37:01.088 --> 37:03.438
Who took the
picture, sir?

37:03.482 --> 37:06.485
[sighs]
Carl Dalton.

37:07.921 --> 37:09.314
He used to go hunting with us.

37:09.357 --> 37:11.272
Does he have a connection
to the company?

37:12.752 --> 37:14.406
He's Wickes' half-brother

37:14.449 --> 37:18.236
and in-house counsel
for Wickes Steel.

37:24.372 --> 37:26.505
DALTON:
Phillip,

37:26.548 --> 37:28.420
what's going on?

37:28.463 --> 37:30.160
You said you were in trouble?

37:32.685 --> 37:35.644
I'm not in trouble,
Carl, you are.

37:35.688 --> 37:38.038
Please tell them
they're wrong.

37:38.081 --> 37:40.170
Did you kill
Lawrence Ridgeway?

37:44.697 --> 37:47.003
I'm sorry.

37:47.047 --> 37:48.657
No.

37:48.701 --> 37:50.616
You shot him?

37:52.095 --> 37:54.750
It's my job to look out for you.

37:54.794 --> 37:58.188
To look out for
this family.

37:58.232 --> 38:01.409
People depend on me.

38:01.453 --> 38:03.237
When they told me
about the rifle,

38:03.281 --> 38:04.586
I thought...

38:04.630 --> 38:07.589
but I didn't want
to believe it was you.

38:07.633 --> 38:09.939
Ridgeway told me
about the account.

38:09.983 --> 38:12.115
If that money disappeared,
and they came asking,

38:12.159 --> 38:13.465
he would have pointed to me.

38:13.508 --> 38:15.467
He was a loose end.

38:15.510 --> 38:16.772
I had to protect us.

38:16.816 --> 38:18.470
And why not

38:18.513 --> 38:21.037
blackmail the Secretary
of the Navy while you're at it.

38:21.081 --> 38:23.039
That was nothing ;
it was an empty threat.

38:23.083 --> 38:24.737
It was a diversion.

38:24.780 --> 38:27.130
Man is still dead.

38:28.741 --> 38:30.873
But that AUTEC money
is just sitting there,

38:30.917 --> 38:33.223
and we're about to
lose everything.

38:33.267 --> 38:35.922
I did this for
both of us.

38:35.965 --> 38:37.924
We needed it, Phillip.

38:37.967 --> 38:39.534
Didn't we?

38:42.885 --> 38:44.583
Didn't we?

38:50.806 --> 38:52.982
Oh, no.

38:53.026 --> 38:54.419
Vance nails you

38:54.462 --> 38:56.812
with the shredding detail, huh?

38:56.856 --> 39:00.729
Yes, from redacted to
unredacted to recycling to...

39:00.773 --> 39:03.166
Tell me, I have a question.

39:03.210 --> 39:04.516
Hmm?

39:04.559 --> 39:06.605
Do you believe?

39:06.648 --> 39:08.563
Believe in what?

39:08.607 --> 39:11.740
[sighs]

39:11.784 --> 39:13.351
Well,

39:13.394 --> 39:15.527
unexplained things,

39:15.570 --> 39:18.660
secrets,

39:18.704 --> 39:22.403
occurrences that we're really
not supposed to talk about?

39:22.447 --> 39:24.797
Oh.

39:24.840 --> 39:27.060
Well...

39:27.103 --> 39:29.541
I believe

39:29.584 --> 39:33.806
that there are moments,
experiences

39:33.849 --> 39:37.070
that someone like McGee,
with his trusty computer,

39:37.113 --> 39:39.464
couldn't justify.

39:39.507 --> 39:42.771
When Gibbs left tonight,

39:42.815 --> 39:45.948
I... thought I saw it again.

39:45.992 --> 39:47.820
Saw what?

39:47.863 --> 39:50.039
The bounce.

39:50.083 --> 39:52.041
You know,
I've been thinking about that.

39:52.085 --> 39:54.217
Boss don't bounce.

39:55.262 --> 39:59.397
You cannot expect a person

39:59.440 --> 40:02.225
to keep things bottled up
inside forever,

40:02.269 --> 40:03.618
can you?

40:07.492 --> 40:09.624
RYAN:
Mm, charades.

40:09.668 --> 40:10.712
Let's play.

40:10.756 --> 40:12.497
Now?

40:12.540 --> 40:13.759
[snorts]

40:13.802 --> 40:15.500
It's as good a time as any.

40:15.543 --> 40:16.936
[chuckles]

40:16.979 --> 40:18.677
No.
Why not?

40:19.721 --> 40:22.332
Because I don't
play games, Doc.

40:22.376 --> 40:24.813
[laughs]

40:24.857 --> 40:26.859
Like hell you don't.

40:30.384 --> 40:33.126
You know, people keep looking
at their watch,

40:33.169 --> 40:35.998
usually means they're worried
about something.

40:36.042 --> 40:37.347
You got to run?

40:37.391 --> 40:39.698
Oh, I've been running.

40:41.743 --> 40:44.137
Maybe it's time you stopped?

40:46.182 --> 40:48.097
I wish I could.

40:48.141 --> 40:50.839
You can.

40:50.883 --> 40:54.234
Parker can.

40:54.277 --> 40:56.845
You have no idea.

40:58.934 --> 41:01.284
You still want to play charades?

41:05.158 --> 41:07.160
Yeah.

41:19.215 --> 41:20.956
I got to go.

41:21.000 --> 41:22.871
[laughs]
Really?

41:22.915 --> 41:24.438
Mm-hmm.

41:24.482 --> 41:26.484
Parker.

41:30.139 --> 41:33.491
You know, I can help you,
Doc, with your ex.

41:33.534 --> 41:35.493
[chuckles]

41:37.582 --> 41:38.800
No, you can't.

41:38.844 --> 41:40.846
Oh, yeah, I can.

41:43.849 --> 41:47.722
I need to go home
and check my judgment.

41:47.766 --> 41:50.769
It's about Wickes again?

41:53.989 --> 41:55.687
You were right about the tell.

41:55.730 --> 41:58.428
He looked at that photo
for a reason.

41:59.778 --> 42:01.649
Yeah, he did.

42:01.693 --> 42:04.783
That's not enough.

42:04.826 --> 42:08.134
So, you were wrong
about the guy.

42:08.177 --> 42:13.008
No one here likes you any less.

42:15.054 --> 42:17.839
I want to stop running, Gibbs.

42:17.883 --> 42:21.234
Really see the people around me

42:21.277 --> 42:23.802
and not just blurs as I fly by.

42:23.845 --> 42:26.239
Really see them.

42:26.282 --> 42:28.850
I just don't know if I can.

42:32.637 --> 42:34.552
Not yet.

42:35.944 --> 42:38.860
I'm here, Doc.

42:41.471 --> 42:43.473
I know.

42:50.916 --> 42:52.918
