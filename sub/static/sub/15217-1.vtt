01:05.280 --> 01:07.271
I'm Amy Mitchell,
and I'm a mom.

01:08.080 --> 01:10.196
I had my first kid
when I was 20 years old,

01:10.280 --> 01:12.396
and I've been
running late ever since.

01:15.800 --> 01:17.856
My days are filled with
dropping the kids at school...

01:17.880 --> 01:18.880
Love you.

01:19.480 --> 01:21.391
...then racing to work
where I have meeting,

01:21.680 --> 01:23.636
after meeting,
after meeting.

01:24.080 --> 01:27.072
I usually end up eating
a shitty lunch at my desk,

01:27.920 --> 01:29.638
and I try to work
out once a week.

01:30.120 --> 01:32.793
Why do I suck at Zumba?

01:34.320 --> 01:37.073
Most days, I race back to
school for the kids' plays,

01:37.200 --> 01:39.430
and poetry readings
and class projects...

01:40.440 --> 01:41.440
Mom!

01:41.480 --> 01:43.360
...which I'm always late for.
Sorry.

01:43.480 --> 01:45.038
And then
there's PTA meetings,

01:45.320 --> 01:47.914
and volunteering and
parent-teacher conferences.

01:49.040 --> 01:51.634
Jesus, Miss Wiggins
fuckin ' hates me.

01:53.040 --> 01:56.430
At least once a day,
I feel like the worst mom in the world,

01:56.520 --> 01:57.953
and I cry in my car.

01:59.840 --> 02:02.593
Then I shuttle the kids to
piano lessons and soccer games

02:02.680 --> 02:04.400
and dance classes
and doctors' appointments,

02:04.520 --> 02:06.476
before my daily trip
to the grocery store.

02:07.240 --> 02:08.240
Ugh.

02:08.320 --> 02:10.993
This chick seems like
she's got it all figured out.

02:11.480 --> 02:14.358
But I feel like I'm
screwing up all the time.

02:14.640 --> 02:16.596
Still, I love being a mom.

02:16.680 --> 02:18.776
Here, baby. There's your
organic turkey club sandwich,

02:18.800 --> 02:21.633
and Dylan, here's your peanut-free
peanut butter for lunch.

02:21.720 --> 02:22.816
What's peanut-free
peanut butter?

02:22.840 --> 02:23.840
I have no idea.

02:24.360 --> 02:26.920
Baby, here's your American
history project I made you.

02:27.040 --> 02:28.040
I hope you like it.

02:28.520 --> 02:30.511
I love you.
I love you!

02:30.920 --> 02:32.990
Oh, my God, Mom!
Not so loud! My God.

02:33.080 --> 02:34.877
I love my babies so much!

02:36.840 --> 02:38.353
God, they hate me.

02:38.880 --> 02:40.154
Hey, Amy!

02:40.320 --> 02:41.673
Hey, guys.

02:42.200 --> 02:44.156
God, I just don't
know how you do it.

02:44.240 --> 02:45.958
You just leave
your kids all day

02:46.040 --> 02:47.109
and go to work?

02:47.200 --> 02:48.349
You're so strong.

02:48.880 --> 02:50.313
Yeah, thank you.

02:50.440 --> 02:52.271
Don't you miss them?

02:52.680 --> 02:55.638
I do. But I also
need, like, money.

02:55.880 --> 02:56.880
- Right.
- Hmm.

02:56.960 --> 02:58.757
Oh, gosh, you guys,
I'm so sorry. I gotta go.

02:58.840 --> 03:00.114
I'm really late
to work.

03:00.240 --> 03:01.992
Well, you're
always late.

03:02.080 --> 03:03.798
I know. It's basically
the only thing

03:03.880 --> 03:05.154
I'm good at these days.

03:05.240 --> 03:06.275
See you guys later.

03:06.720 --> 03:08.517
God, I just love
how hard she works.

03:08.720 --> 03:10.711
Oh, my God, I love
how hard she works.

03:11.120 --> 03:12.553
I just fuckin'
said that, Vicky.

03:16.800 --> 03:19.155
I work at
a super-hip coffee company.

03:19.240 --> 03:20.514
I love my job,

03:20.640 --> 03:24.872
but I'm 32 years old and I'm
the oldest person here by far.

03:24.960 --> 03:27.474
Most of these dudes
just play ping-pong all day.

03:27.840 --> 03:28.909
Morning, Momma.

03:29.000 --> 03:30.000
Morning, Tessa.

03:30.080 --> 03:33.834
Oh, my God, I am so fucking
hungover, I might actually die.

03:35.200 --> 03:37.475
That's probably something
you shouldn't tell your boss.

03:37.600 --> 03:38.600
Oh.

03:38.720 --> 03:41.837
Right. Except that I took like a
shitload of pills this morning,

03:41.920 --> 03:44.480
so I don't totally
know where I am yet.

03:44.560 --> 03:45.629
You're at work, Tess.

03:46.000 --> 03:47.592
Oh, perfect.
Yeah.

03:47.680 --> 03:50.274
May I have a vacation?
I'd like to go to Cuba.

03:50.600 --> 03:52.272
Is that allowed?
No.

03:52.600 --> 03:53.828
Good morning.

03:53.960 --> 03:55.154
Hey, boss!

03:55.240 --> 03:56.389
Good morning, Dale.

03:56.680 --> 03:58.159
I had a dream
last night.

03:58.480 --> 04:00.311
Ooh.
I was naked in a hotel.

04:00.400 --> 04:02.152
I'm talking fully
naked, dick, balls...

04:02.280 --> 04:03.315
Yep, got it.

04:03.400 --> 04:05.914
No glasses. Everything,
fully fucking naked.

04:06.120 --> 04:07.120
We got it.

04:07.200 --> 04:08.679
I walk over to
the coffee maker

04:09.040 --> 04:12.157
and there is a bag of our
coffee in the hotel room.

04:12.520 --> 04:13.748
Cool dream, Dale.

04:13.840 --> 04:15.034
Thank you, Tessa.

04:15.120 --> 04:16.154
Um...

04:16.240 --> 04:18.151
Is this your
way of saying that

04:18.240 --> 04:20.754
you wanna start selling
your coffee to hotels, now?

04:20.880 --> 04:23.474
No. This is my way of
saying that I want you

04:23.560 --> 04:25.790
to start selling our
coffee to hotels now.

04:25.880 --> 04:28.599
But Dale, I'm already running
sales for supermarkets,

04:28.680 --> 04:30.352
airlines and restaurants.

04:30.640 --> 04:31.868
I mean,
I'm just part-time.

04:32.000 --> 04:33.000
You are?
Since when?

04:33.080 --> 04:34.229
Six years ago!

04:34.600 --> 04:36.158
What?
No way.

04:36.200 --> 04:37.474
She's here like every day.

04:37.560 --> 04:40.677
Oh, I know, but I
have a family and stuff, so...

04:40.800 --> 04:42.756
Hey! You know how important
family is to me.

04:42.840 --> 04:44.398
I got it wrote on
my arm right there.

04:44.480 --> 04:45.480
Oh, wow.

04:45.560 --> 04:47.232
It's dope, right?
So tight.

04:47.320 --> 04:49.709
Oh, shit! I gotta go roller skating.
Do you wanna come?

04:49.840 --> 04:51.432
Yes!
No, Dale!

04:51.560 --> 04:53.357
I have lots
of work to do.

04:53.840 --> 04:55.000
The History Channel
was right.

04:55.080 --> 04:56.752
You guys are the
greatest generation.

05:01.200 --> 05:03.794
I live just outside
of Chicago with my two kids,

05:03.880 --> 05:05.757
my dog
and my husband, Mike.

05:06.440 --> 05:08.317
He's a successful
mortgage broker,

05:08.400 --> 05:10.960
but sometimes he
feels like my third child.

05:11.080 --> 05:12.991
Hey, babe.
Hey... Oh!

05:13.080 --> 05:14.816
Look at all the bags you're carrying.
That's hilarious.

05:14.840 --> 05:16.193
You look like a Sherpa.

05:18.880 --> 05:19.915
Oh!

05:20.000 --> 05:23.151
You guys. Thank you
for being super patient.

05:23.240 --> 05:25.470
I appreciate it.

05:25.720 --> 05:26.994
Here we go, guys.

05:27.080 --> 05:28.195
Thanks, honey.

05:28.280 --> 05:30.111
All right, love.
How was work?

05:30.440 --> 05:33.512
Oh, I had two conference
calls and then I took a nap.

05:33.600 --> 05:34.999
It was exhausting.

05:35.760 --> 05:37.478
I bet. I bet.
Uh...

05:38.040 --> 05:41.555
Dylan, baby, how was
your science quiz?

05:41.840 --> 05:43.114
Oh, I got a D.

05:43.200 --> 05:44.792
A D? But we
worked so hard.

05:44.880 --> 05:45.880
Baby, what happened?

05:46.280 --> 05:48.480
Do you need extra help?
Should we get you another tutor?

05:48.560 --> 05:49.879
Mmm, nah, I'm good.

05:50.480 --> 05:51.674
Mike?

05:51.760 --> 05:54.354
Did you hear? Dylan got a
D on his science quiz.

05:55.320 --> 05:56.548
Way to go, bud.

05:57.600 --> 05:59.477
What? Okay.

05:59.880 --> 06:00.880
Um...

06:00.960 --> 06:03.918
Jane! Oh, my gosh! Wait!
How was your soccer tryouts?

06:04.160 --> 06:07.470
Coach is posting a list of
who made the team tonight at 9:00,

06:07.560 --> 06:08.834
and I'm so nervous.

06:08.920 --> 06:11.639
Baby, it's okay, relax.
You will make the soccer team, I promise.

06:12.080 --> 06:13.274
Just don't freak out.

06:15.800 --> 06:17.597
I'm freakin' out. I am, too.

06:17.680 --> 06:19.352
What time is it now?
8:59.

06:19.480 --> 06:21.118
Come on!

06:21.560 --> 06:24.074
Oh, it's 9:00! It's 9:00.
Go, go, go! Hit refresh.

06:25.280 --> 06:27.714
- Oh, my God. I made the team.
- I made the team!

06:27.800 --> 06:29.358
Oh, my God.
I am so relieved.

06:29.920 --> 06:30.955
Thank you.
Oh, my God.

06:31.080 --> 06:33.594
Baby,
I'm so proud of you!

06:34.160 --> 06:35.360
Oh, I'm so excited.
Oh, my God.

06:35.440 --> 06:38.113
This is gonna look so awesome
on my college applications.

06:38.600 --> 06:39.794
Baby, it's great,
it's great,

06:39.920 --> 06:41.751
but just remember
you're only 12, so it's...

06:41.880 --> 06:42.880
Wait.

06:43.320 --> 06:44.594
What if I don't play?

06:45.520 --> 06:47.476
What if I'm a loser
benchwarmer scrub?

06:48.000 --> 06:49.496
You're great,
you're gonna be fine, you're...

06:49.520 --> 06:51.511
No! It's not fine, Mom.

06:51.640 --> 06:53.119
Do you understand
how hard it is

06:53.200 --> 06:55.111
to get into
an Ivy League school now?

06:55.200 --> 06:57.191
I mean,
they turn away Asians.

06:57.880 --> 06:59.518
That's a little
racist, but...

06:59.640 --> 07:01.517
Oh, my God! I need to
practice my footwork.

07:01.600 --> 07:02.720
Why'd you let me
eat dessert?

07:02.800 --> 07:05.473
Oh, I know,
because you hate me!

07:06.400 --> 07:07.719
Holy shit.

07:15.480 --> 07:17.152
Hey, babe. It's late.
I'm going to bed.

07:17.240 --> 07:18.240
No.

07:18.560 --> 07:20.073
Oh, my God,
are you...

07:20.160 --> 07:22.799
No, no, no, I was just
checking my prostate.

07:23.240 --> 07:26.232
You know, I've always wondered
what kind of porn you like.

07:26.320 --> 07:27.720
Why won't this
fucking window close?

07:28.640 --> 07:31.200
Oh, my God,
that's a giant bush!

07:32.000 --> 07:33.115
Uh, who the hell
are you?

07:35.000 --> 07:36.558
I'm his wife.

07:36.840 --> 07:37.875
Oh, shit.

07:38.800 --> 07:41.109
Are you masturbating
online with some chick?

07:41.200 --> 07:42.428
No, no!

07:42.520 --> 07:43.720
Well, then,
what are you doing?

07:44.040 --> 07:46.713
Uh, um...
I was clicking and then I...

07:47.640 --> 07:48.640
So then I was...

07:48.720 --> 07:51.234
Yes, okay, I was masturbating
online with some chick.

07:51.360 --> 07:53.669
What the fuck!
Why are you doing that?

07:54.000 --> 07:56.753
Hold on a second. I don't think
I've done anything wrong.

07:56.840 --> 07:58.796
This is totally
mainstream now.

07:58.880 --> 08:00.313
Hi, I'm Sharon.

08:01.360 --> 08:02.536
I don't know,
I don't know, Mike.

08:02.560 --> 08:05.518
This really
feels like cheating.

08:05.920 --> 08:08.912
No, no, no, no, no,
this is definitely not cheating, honey.

08:09.000 --> 08:10.274
I've never even
touched her.

08:10.360 --> 08:13.079
Her giant bush
is 2,000 miles away.

08:13.720 --> 08:15.995
But how long have
you been doing this?

08:16.200 --> 08:17.997
Oh, I don't know.
Not long.

08:18.080 --> 08:19.559
Ten months next Friday.

08:20.360 --> 08:21.554
What the fuck?

08:21.680 --> 08:22.908
Ten months?

08:25.720 --> 08:27.870
Do you have
feelings for her?

08:30.360 --> 08:32.510
You don't masturbate online
with someone for 10 months

08:32.600 --> 08:33.919
without developing
some feelings.

08:34.000 --> 08:35.433
I mean, I'm not
a monster.

08:35.559 --> 08:37.630
Do you have
feelings for her, Mike?

08:37.720 --> 08:40.712
Yes! Okay?
I have feelings for her! God!

08:42.720 --> 08:44.551
She's actually
a pretty amazing woman.

08:44.680 --> 08:46.557
You know, she runs
her own dairy farm,

08:46.640 --> 08:48.119
she's developing
an app.

08:48.200 --> 08:49.713
Get out!
What?

08:51.080 --> 08:52.593
Get the fuck
out of my house.

08:57.240 --> 08:58.719
So uncool.

09:04.520 --> 09:05.576
You know, Amy,
I just feel like

09:05.600 --> 09:07.280
Mike is feeling
really trapped right now...

09:17.640 --> 09:20.996
Okay, so your dad had to go
outta town on a business trip,

09:21.120 --> 09:23.554
so I'm gonna try to do
everything myself today,

09:24.120 --> 09:25.189
which should be fine,

09:25.280 --> 09:29.558
as long as everybody does
what they are supposed to do.

09:29.640 --> 09:30.640
Right?

09:30.760 --> 09:32.432
Oh, no.

09:32.560 --> 09:34.357
Why is Roscoe
walking like that?

09:34.440 --> 09:36.112
He's fine.
He's totally fine.

09:38.160 --> 09:39.878
Oh, no, buddy!

09:55.960 --> 09:57.393
Lookin' good, Jeff.

09:57.480 --> 09:58.515
Oh.

09:58.600 --> 10:00.397
Thanks.
Yeah, you been workin' out?

10:00.480 --> 10:02.550
No, not for
like 10 years.

10:02.640 --> 10:05.632
Your beige windbreaker is
really lightin' up my board.

10:06.160 --> 10:07.388
Oh, uh, thanks.

10:07.480 --> 10:08.959
Do you know what I mean?
My vagina.

10:11.760 --> 10:13.113
Bye, Jeff!

10:13.200 --> 10:15.589
Emergency PTA meeting tonight.
Tell all your friends.

10:16.280 --> 10:17.280
Oh, God.

10:17.360 --> 10:19.396
There goes that little weird
stay-at-home mom.

10:19.480 --> 10:21.675
Emergency PTA meeting tonight.
Tell all your friends.

10:22.080 --> 10:23.308
Oh, I don't have
any friends.

10:23.560 --> 10:26.074
Oh.
I'm pretty isolated at home.

10:26.160 --> 10:27.229
I have four kids.

10:27.320 --> 10:29.231
Okay, good. Please move along.
Thank you.

10:29.320 --> 10:30.376
Emergency PTA
meeting tonight.

10:30.400 --> 10:31.400
Thank you
for inviting me.

10:35.720 --> 10:37.950
Oh, my God. She just got all
her sadness all over me.

10:38.040 --> 10:39.519
Oh, shit!

10:39.600 --> 10:40.794
Here comes
the hot widower.

10:50.200 --> 10:51.235
Hey, Jessie.
Hey, guys.

10:51.320 --> 10:52.320
- Hi.
- Hi.

10:52.720 --> 10:54.233
Cute backpack
you got there.

10:54.680 --> 10:56.955
Oh, yeah.
Uh, I'm such an Elsa.

10:59.200 --> 11:02.078
You're hilarious!
You really are!

11:02.240 --> 11:03.309
God, he's so
fucking hot.

11:03.400 --> 11:04.440
- Here you go.
- I know.

11:04.520 --> 11:06.238
I'm so glad his wife died.

11:06.360 --> 11:09.238
You know what? I saw him install a
car seat yesterday in two seconds.

11:09.360 --> 11:11.749
I'm tellin' you, it was like
boom, boom, click.

11:11.920 --> 11:14.115
It was so hot.
Oh, gosh.

11:15.320 --> 11:17.436
You know what? I think I'd
let him put it in my butt.

11:17.560 --> 11:19.680
I mean, in theory,
I'm not really into the butt thing,

11:19.760 --> 11:22.228
but I would let him
go to town back there.

11:22.560 --> 11:24.596
I'm with you.
Emergency PTA meeting.

11:25.400 --> 11:27.136
Okay, I got four minutes
to get Roscoe to the vet,

11:27.160 --> 11:28.776
so I love you kids, get out,
get out, get out, get out.

11:28.800 --> 11:30.153
I love you so much.
I'm so sorry.

11:30.600 --> 11:31.600
Bye, Mom.

11:33.480 --> 11:35.710
Oh!
Oh, my God! Oh!

11:36.240 --> 11:37.992
Fuck, it's so hot!
Can you roll down...

11:38.080 --> 11:40.196
Can you roll down the window?
Okay. Okay, okay.

11:41.080 --> 11:42.479
Hey. Hey, babe, listen.
Hi.

11:42.760 --> 11:46.036
There is a emergency PTA
meeting today at 5:00.

11:46.120 --> 11:48.190
It should be about
two to three hours.

11:48.600 --> 11:49.999
Awesome. Awesome.
Okay?

11:50.680 --> 11:52.591
Your dog's wearing a helmet.
Okay, I know.

11:52.680 --> 11:54.079
Yes, it's... Thank you.

11:54.480 --> 11:55.595
Okay.

11:59.600 --> 12:00.749
Fuck!

12:02.720 --> 12:05.029
Your dog has vertigo.
That can't be a thing.

12:05.360 --> 12:08.079
And you are gonna have to
carry him until he gets home.

12:08.400 --> 12:09.560
Are you shitting me
right now?

12:09.640 --> 12:10.675
I don't shit.

12:10.760 --> 12:13.433
But he will, uncontrollably,
for the next 36 hours.

12:15.880 --> 12:17.518
I'm here.
I'm here. Amy's here.

12:18.560 --> 12:20.073
You missed
the meeting, bro.

12:21.280 --> 12:22.508
Oh, no.

12:24.400 --> 12:25.833
Fuck, fuck, fuck,
fuck, fuck.

12:48.480 --> 12:50.357
I know, I know.
I'm sorry, I'm late.

12:50.440 --> 12:51.589
Get in, get in, get in.

12:53.000 --> 12:56.117
I can't believe I'm gonna be late
to my first soccer practice.

12:56.200 --> 12:58.156
Baby, I'm doing
the best that I can.

12:58.240 --> 12:59.878
Yeah, that's what
makes it even sadder.

13:00.200 --> 13:01.349
Oh, God.

13:01.440 --> 13:04.159
Hey, Dylan. Hey, honey.
How was your day?

13:04.280 --> 13:05.759
I swallowed
a pen cap again.

13:06.280 --> 13:07.280
Oh, God.

13:07.560 --> 13:08.595
Ooh!

13:09.240 --> 13:10.240
Crap.

13:10.320 --> 13:11.548
Was that a hit-and-run?

13:11.960 --> 13:12.960
Nope.

13:13.600 --> 13:14.828
Nope.
That was nothing.

13:21.840 --> 13:23.558
Jane, go!
Go, go, go, go!

13:23.680 --> 13:25.193
Excuse me, Coach?

13:25.560 --> 13:27.994
I'm so sorry that Jane is late.
It is all my fault.

13:28.720 --> 13:30.756
You look wrecked.
You having a bad day?

13:30.840 --> 13:32.751
Oh, God, it literally
could not get any...

13:32.840 --> 13:34.273
Ah!

13:34.840 --> 13:35.955
Shit.

13:40.360 --> 13:41.679
Hey...

13:43.120 --> 13:45.111
Hi, guys! Guys, um...

13:46.080 --> 13:48.799
For those of you who have been
living under a rock...

13:48.880 --> 13:50.871
I am Gwendolyn James.

13:51.000 --> 13:53.719
I am the president
of the PTA,

13:54.160 --> 13:55.388
but most importantly,

13:56.200 --> 13:59.715
I am the proud mommy
to two beautiful daughters,

13:59.800 --> 14:01.392
Blaire and Gandhi.

14:02.480 --> 14:05.870
Now, I called this
emergency PTA meeting

14:05.960 --> 14:10.238
to address an issue that radically
affects the safety of our children.

14:11.880 --> 14:12.915
The bake sale.

14:16.240 --> 14:17.798
Is this a joke?

14:17.880 --> 14:20.110
Now, this is a list
of the toxic ingredients

14:20.200 --> 14:22.589
that are absolutely banned
from the bake sale.

14:23.720 --> 14:26.837
No BPA,
no MSG, no BHA, no BHT.

14:26.920 --> 14:29.480
Plus no soy, no sesame,
and, of course, no nuts

14:29.560 --> 14:31.994
or eggs or milk or butter
or salt or sugar or wheat.

14:32.080 --> 14:33.080
Okay?

14:33.160 --> 14:34.991
Sorry, what ingredients
can we use?

14:35.080 --> 14:36.856
Anyway, I will be putting together...
Thank you.

14:36.880 --> 14:39.917
...a special bake
sale police force

14:40.000 --> 14:45.154
that will monitor the food. That
will destroy any offensive treats

14:45.760 --> 14:48.433
and prosecute
the wrongdoers.

14:48.600 --> 14:49.600
Yes.

14:49.680 --> 14:52.319
So who will be
my first volunteer

14:52.400 --> 14:53.600
for the bake sale
police force?

14:53.640 --> 14:57.713
I think we're gonna
have Amy Mitchell!

14:59.120 --> 15:00.189
What?

15:00.280 --> 15:02.032
That's what you get
for being late, sweetie.

15:04.040 --> 15:05.040
No.

15:07.800 --> 15:08.915
What's that now?

15:09.560 --> 15:11.676
I've had a really long day.

15:12.880 --> 15:15.997
I have been
bruised and burned,

15:16.280 --> 15:17.508
knocked unconscious.

15:17.600 --> 15:20.194
I screwed up my daughter's
first day at soccer

15:20.280 --> 15:24.034
and I hand-searched
my son's poo for a pen cap

15:24.480 --> 15:27.756
and my poor dog
has vertigo.

15:27.840 --> 15:30.912
I mean, who knew that that was
even a real thing, you guys?

15:31.880 --> 15:33.677
God, I'm drowning
at work

15:33.760 --> 15:36.115
and my boss
is a fucking moron

15:36.480 --> 15:37.629
and...

15:38.320 --> 15:40.197
Three hours ago
I may or may not

15:40.280 --> 15:42.236
have committed
a felony hit-and-run.

15:43.640 --> 15:46.313
I can't do this anymore.

15:48.160 --> 15:49.388
I'm sorry.

15:49.840 --> 15:51.068
I'm done.

15:54.320 --> 15:55.799
I quit.

16:27.280 --> 16:29.475
Hey, what can I get ya?
Oh, Scotch.

16:31.080 --> 16:32.080
Oh, hey, I know you.

16:32.880 --> 16:35.440
You're that chick that always
picks up my kid from school

16:35.520 --> 16:37.476
when I forget/don't
want to.

16:37.880 --> 16:41.031
Amy Mitchell. Yeah, Carla.
Carla Dunkler.

16:41.120 --> 16:42.758
Jesus, you look like
a bag of dicks.

16:43.000 --> 16:44.956
Thanks.
Hi.

16:45.040 --> 16:47.952
I'm really sorry to interrupt,
but, um, I just have to tell you,

16:48.040 --> 16:51.032
what you did back there
was amazing.

16:51.160 --> 16:53.276
Thank you.

16:53.360 --> 16:54.634
It's Kiki, right?

16:54.760 --> 16:55.829
Yes.

16:56.520 --> 16:57.555
She knows my name.

16:58.880 --> 17:00.472
I feel like
Beyoncé Knowles.

17:00.560 --> 17:02.056
Why don't you sit down
and have a drink with us?

17:02.080 --> 17:04.877
What do you mean "us"? Honey, I
was just sitting here by myself.

17:05.000 --> 17:06.148
I would love to,
but I can't.

17:06.240 --> 17:07.415
I have to go to
the grocery store

17:07.440 --> 17:09.816
and then I have to go home and
clean out my son's hamster cage,

17:09.839 --> 17:11.215
'cause he gets so
mad when I forget.

17:11.240 --> 17:13.231
Have a drink, Kiki.
Okay, yeah.

17:13.319 --> 17:15.196
Okay. Yes, I'd like
an apple juice.

17:15.280 --> 17:16.759
Why don't you
have this instead?

17:18.520 --> 17:19.839
Excuse me?

17:21.079 --> 17:23.833
Oh, do you know what my
favorite mom fantasy is?

17:23.920 --> 17:25.035
What?
Uh-oh.

17:25.280 --> 17:29.193
Having a quiet
breakfast by myself.

17:29.280 --> 17:31.236
Oh! That is so hot!
Oh!

17:31.360 --> 17:32.918
Sounds glorious.
Oh.

17:33.640 --> 17:36.074
Sometimes when I'm
driving all by myself,

17:36.200 --> 17:38.080
I have this fantasy that
I get into a car crash.

17:38.280 --> 17:41.317
Not a big one with fire and explosions,
but just like a little one.

17:41.400 --> 17:42.628
But I do get injured

17:42.720 --> 17:45.439
and I get to go to the
hospital for two weeks

17:45.520 --> 17:49.593
and I sleep all day and I eat
Jell-O and I watch so much TV

17:49.680 --> 17:51.591
and it's all
covered by my insurance.

17:51.680 --> 17:54.877
My kids bring me balloons,
and the nurses rub cream on my feet,

17:54.960 --> 17:57.190
and oh, my God,
it's so amazing.

17:59.960 --> 18:04.272
Is that like something you
guys fantasize about, too?

18:04.680 --> 18:05.874
No.
No.

18:05.960 --> 18:07.791
You're bat-shit crazy.
Yeah.

18:08.520 --> 18:10.511
And I'm never gonna get
into a car with you.

18:14.720 --> 18:16.472
Is it fun
being a single mom?

18:16.960 --> 18:18.075
Yes!

18:18.640 --> 18:20.312
I go to the casino.
Yeah.

18:20.800 --> 18:22.995
You know,
I'm learning karate now.

18:23.440 --> 18:26.318
Plus, I have, like, a stable
of hot dudes to call right up

18:26.440 --> 18:27.998
whenever I want
some D in my V.

18:28.840 --> 18:31.798
I wanna be a single mom.
No, it's fuckin' awesome.

18:32.160 --> 18:33.195
Bottom line is,

18:33.280 --> 18:35.430
I have to live my life one
quarter mile at a time.

18:36.080 --> 18:38.275
Is that from... Yeah.
The Fast and Furious.

18:39.000 --> 18:41.912
I fucked Vin Diesel when he
was in town doing Furious 6.

18:42.000 --> 18:43.911
You fucked Vin Diesel?
Yeah.

18:44.000 --> 18:45.194
Vincent Diesel?

18:45.680 --> 18:48.478
It might not have been
actually Vin Diesel,

18:48.560 --> 18:50.516
but I definitely
fucked a bald guy.

18:50.720 --> 18:52.153
Salud.
Salud.

18:52.240 --> 18:53.434
Yep.
To Vincent Diesel.

18:53.520 --> 18:54.555
Oh, my God.
Jesus.

18:54.680 --> 18:56.830
Kiki, get your shit together.
Oh, my God.

18:57.080 --> 18:58.832
Do you know what I hate?
Mmm?

18:58.920 --> 19:00.911
There are so many
fuckin' rules now.

19:01.000 --> 19:02.069
Yes, God.

19:02.200 --> 19:04.760
"Don't punish your kids."
"Don't say no to your kids."

19:04.840 --> 19:06.876
Yeah. "Go to your
kid's baseball games."

19:06.960 --> 19:08.359
"Tell your kids
you love 'em."

19:08.480 --> 19:11.040
"Don't fuck the janitor
at your kid's school."

19:11.120 --> 19:13.111
I mean, what the
fuck is this? Russia?

19:13.920 --> 19:17.913
We're killing ourselves, trying to be
perfect, and it's making us insane.

19:18.200 --> 19:21.237
In this day and age,
it's impossible to be a good mom.

19:22.400 --> 19:24.038
Screw it.
Yeah.

19:24.160 --> 19:25.309
Let's be bad moms.

19:25.480 --> 19:27.118
Oh, I'm in.
Right?

19:27.200 --> 19:29.714
Oh, my gosh, okay.
This is exciting. I'm in!

19:29.800 --> 19:33.076
Yes! To bad moms. Whoo!
To bad moms!

19:33.480 --> 19:34.515
Aw.

19:35.560 --> 19:36.993
I love you guys.
Mmm.

19:37.080 --> 19:38.479
Oh, dude.
We love you, Kiki.

19:38.560 --> 19:40.118
We just met, Kiki.
Forever.

19:40.240 --> 19:42.120
I love you forever.
I'm not into this kind of...

19:42.240 --> 19:44.470
Oh, gosh, honey,
we gotta go get you home.

19:44.560 --> 19:45.754
We gotta go.
Yeah, let's go.

19:45.880 --> 19:48.161
We gotta go. No, I can't.
I have to go to the supermarket.

19:49.640 --> 19:51.153
Let's go
to the supermarket!

20:59.520 --> 21:01.954
Oh, my God.

21:02.320 --> 21:04.709
- You're so cute.
- Adorable.

21:04.920 --> 21:06.433
Oh, I wanna
eat her face.

21:06.520 --> 21:07.555
Hi, bunny.

21:07.640 --> 21:08.675
All right, let's go!

21:52.520 --> 21:53.669
Where is she?

21:57.000 --> 21:59.719
Oh, it's so bright,
you guys.

21:59.880 --> 22:00.949
Are you okay?

22:01.040 --> 22:02.473
Yeah, I'm awesome.

22:02.600 --> 22:04.033
What did you
do last night?

22:05.160 --> 22:06.388
Nothin'.

22:06.960 --> 22:09.269
But we may need to
find a new supermarket.

22:11.120 --> 22:14.157
Oh, my God.
I made nachos last night!

22:14.920 --> 22:15.920
Oh.

22:17.360 --> 22:18.588
Amazing.

22:19.400 --> 22:20.435
Mmm.

22:20.520 --> 22:22.511
The cheese is so hard.

22:28.240 --> 22:29.309
Um...

22:29.400 --> 22:31.550
Aren't you gonna
make us breakfast?

22:31.640 --> 22:32.709
Oh.

22:32.800 --> 22:33.835
No.

22:35.440 --> 22:37.749
But what are we
gonna eat?

22:37.840 --> 22:40.559
You guys are really smart.

22:40.680 --> 22:42.318
You can make
your own breakfast.

22:44.480 --> 22:46.072
I'm just gonna
take these to go.

22:51.120 --> 22:52.348
Peace!

22:54.720 --> 22:56.073
All right,
get in the car.

22:57.800 --> 22:59.472
You know what?
On second thought,

22:59.600 --> 23:01.240
let's take your
daddy's special car today.

23:02.320 --> 23:04.117
Won't Dad be mad?
Yeah.

23:04.200 --> 23:05.428
Probably.

23:34.360 --> 23:35.634
Whoo!

23:35.920 --> 23:38.559
That was so awesome!

23:39.640 --> 23:40.914
All right.

23:42.480 --> 23:43.708
What is she driving?

23:44.120 --> 23:45.473
Have a great day
at school!

23:46.120 --> 23:47.599
Oh, wait, wait, wait!
Your lunch!

23:50.160 --> 23:52.390
Thanks, Mom.
You're the best mom ever!

23:52.480 --> 23:53.913
Aw, I love you, guys!

23:54.800 --> 23:56.233
Is that Arby's?

23:56.320 --> 23:58.231
I love their
hot fish sandwich.

23:58.320 --> 24:00.311
Hey, Amy. Hi.

24:00.440 --> 24:01.880
Hey, we're having
a PTA meeting today

24:02.000 --> 24:04.070
to discuss the upcoming
election at 2:00.

24:04.160 --> 24:05.275
Will we see you there?

24:05.440 --> 24:06.555
No.

24:10.000 --> 24:11.000
Oh.

24:11.080 --> 24:13.116
That bitch is
playing a dangerous game.

24:14.840 --> 24:15.840
Amy plays football?

24:16.480 --> 24:17.549
Oh, my God.

24:26.200 --> 24:27.758
Oh, thank you.

24:28.480 --> 24:29.600
Amazing!

24:30.840 --> 24:31.955
Oh, this is Amy.

24:32.040 --> 24:34.679
Amy, where are you? The morning
huddle started an hour ago.

24:34.920 --> 24:38.515
Oh, yeah, Dale, I'm not going to that.
It's a total waste of time.

24:39.160 --> 24:40.752
Are you feeling okay, Amy?

24:40.840 --> 24:42.671
Are you having
a senior moment?

24:43.120 --> 24:44.678
I've actually
never felt better.

24:44.760 --> 24:48.355
I'm having a quiet breakfast
and reading the newspaper

24:48.440 --> 24:50.715
for the first
time in 12 years.

24:51.200 --> 24:53.714
You need to come into
the office right now!

24:53.800 --> 24:57.509
No, I don't. I don't, Dale. I only
work for you three days a week.

24:57.840 --> 25:01.196
If you want me to work more, then
you should pay me to do that.

25:02.160 --> 25:03.856
Okay, Amy, you're kind of
making me look like a dick

25:03.880 --> 25:05.496
in front of everybody
in the office right now.

25:05.520 --> 25:07.795
Have a great meeting!
Goodbye, Dale.

25:27.240 --> 25:29.390
Hello?
Hey, Kiki. It's Amy.

25:29.480 --> 25:30.480
Hi!

25:30.560 --> 25:32.312
Um, I was actually
calling to see,

25:32.400 --> 25:34.320
uh, if you'd like to join
me at the movies today.

25:35.320 --> 25:36.912
Are we allowed to do that?

25:37.320 --> 25:38.992
Well, I don't see why not.

25:39.200 --> 25:42.078
I can't. I mean, I have
to iron Kent's underwear.

25:42.400 --> 25:43.549
What? Why?

25:43.960 --> 25:45.916
I don't know. He likes
really stiff underwear.

25:46.120 --> 25:48.190
Come on, Kiki,
live a little.

25:51.840 --> 25:54.274
Uh... Okay. Okay, okay.
I'll do it.

25:54.760 --> 25:56.751
Awesome.
Okay, I'll call Carla.

25:56.920 --> 25:59.070
Oh, fun! I like her.

25:59.200 --> 26:00.599
I'm also
very scared of her.

26:01.440 --> 26:02.589
Okay.

26:02.840 --> 26:04.637
Ow! Ow!

26:06.280 --> 26:07.918
Yo!
Hey, it's Amy.

26:08.000 --> 26:09.496
Um, I'm calling to see
if you'd like to join

26:09.520 --> 26:11.016
Kiki and I at the
movies this afternoon.

26:11.040 --> 26:12.189
I'm already here.

26:12.280 --> 26:13.280
Hey, lady.

26:14.200 --> 26:15.997
Get off your phone.
Guess what?

26:16.080 --> 26:17.433
She dies in the end.

26:17.840 --> 26:19.114
Yeah, cancer gets her.

26:19.480 --> 26:20.480
What?

26:20.800 --> 26:22.836
Yeah, what do you
bitches wanna see?

26:30.800 --> 26:33.758
Love is stronger

26:35.400 --> 26:36.628
than space.

26:36.920 --> 26:39.115
You guys, lady boners over here.

26:46.520 --> 26:48.636
Cheers, ladies.
Mmm.

26:48.960 --> 26:49.960
Mmm.

26:50.800 --> 26:53.030
This has been
so much fun.

26:53.160 --> 26:54.616
Thank you, girls,
for coming out with me.

26:54.640 --> 26:55.640
Are you kidding me?

26:55.800 --> 26:58.917
This has literally been the
best day of my entire life.

26:59.000 --> 27:00.194
Oh, honey.

27:00.320 --> 27:03.153
My ex is picking up the kid,
so I can go all night if...

27:03.400 --> 27:05.197
Oh. hey, did you
hear that?

27:05.280 --> 27:06.679
My ex has my kid.

27:07.000 --> 27:08.680
Hey, hon, I've got
a question for you.

27:08.720 --> 27:12.918
Is it hard to share your
son with your ex-husband?

27:13.400 --> 27:14.594
Fuck no.
No?

27:14.680 --> 27:16.955
Have you seen my kid?
He's like nine feet tall

27:17.040 --> 27:18.712
and all he cares
about is baseball.

27:18.800 --> 27:20.392
Do you go
to all of his games?

27:20.480 --> 27:22.471
No. No, I don't.

27:22.920 --> 27:24.560
The last game I went
to was six hours long

27:24.600 --> 27:26.431
and the final score
was one to two.

27:27.040 --> 27:29.576
So, I'd rather go to Afghanistan
than another kids' baseball game.

27:29.600 --> 27:30.600
Cheers.

27:31.360 --> 27:33.874
How do you think that your
divorce affected your kid?

27:35.120 --> 27:37.156
How are things
in your home, Amy?

27:38.120 --> 27:41.192
- Oh, it's fine.
- Everything's fine.

27:43.800 --> 27:44.800
Ugh.

27:46.080 --> 27:49.197
I caught Mike having an
affair online with a woman,

27:49.280 --> 27:51.874
and I guess it's been going
on for like 10 months.

27:52.040 --> 27:54.474
Oh! Did you drive
a spike through his nuts?

27:56.400 --> 27:57.879
No. Here's the truth.

27:58.720 --> 28:01.109
Our marriage has
been over for years.

28:01.520 --> 28:04.034
I don't even remember
the last time we had sex.

28:04.800 --> 28:08.156
Kent and I have sex every
Friday night after Blue Bloods.

28:10.120 --> 28:13.635
I find Tom Selleck's work
to be extremely erotic.

28:14.440 --> 28:18.035
I feel like everything that comes out
of your mouth is a cry for help.

28:18.560 --> 28:20.312
Kiki, you're so weird.

28:20.400 --> 28:21.515
No, wait,

28:21.600 --> 28:23.909
why did you marry this
shithead in the first place?

28:24.000 --> 28:25.115
He sounds like an asshole.

28:25.200 --> 28:26.792
Because we were
young and in love.

28:26.880 --> 28:29.314
I mean, he wasn't always an asshole.
I promise you.

28:30.040 --> 28:33.112
It's true. Listen, I got
pregnant, we got married.

28:33.200 --> 28:34.633
I was only 20.

28:35.440 --> 28:38.113
You know what? Mike and I
never got our twenties.

28:38.200 --> 28:40.589
Like, you know,
the fun twenties, and...

28:40.680 --> 28:41.936
I feel like
maybe he missed that.

28:41.960 --> 28:42.960
Oh, my God.

28:43.440 --> 28:44.873
Maybe I did, too.

28:44.960 --> 28:47.520
When I was in my twenties,
I would just walk down the street

28:47.600 --> 28:50.751
and it would just be raining
dicks wherever I went.

28:50.840 --> 28:52.096
It was just dick,
dick, dick, dick,

28:52.120 --> 28:53.336
dick, dick, dick,
dick, dick, dick.

28:53.360 --> 28:56.158
It was, like, forecast,
lot of cock!

28:57.920 --> 28:58.955
Kiki?

29:00.200 --> 29:02.270
Hi. Kent, hi.

29:02.440 --> 29:03.714
What are you
doing here?

29:03.800 --> 29:06.234
I'm just having lunch
with my new friends.

29:06.320 --> 29:08.436
Who's watching the kids?
Rosie.

29:08.520 --> 29:10.033
Isn't that your job?

29:10.440 --> 29:11.953
Whoa! Who the fuck
are you?

29:12.160 --> 29:13.309
Yes. Yes, Kent.

29:13.400 --> 29:16.995
It absolutely is my job,
and I was just about to leave, so,

29:17.280 --> 29:19.475
um, thank you guys
so much.

29:19.680 --> 29:21.398
I can't, uh,
do the math right now.

29:21.480 --> 29:24.358
Just take that and have a
wonderful day, you guys.

29:24.440 --> 29:25.668
I really enjoyed it.
Thank you.

29:25.760 --> 29:26.795
Oh, my...

29:26.880 --> 29:28.950
Nice to meet you,
Ike Turner!

29:29.360 --> 29:30.759
That's really
disturbing.

29:30.840 --> 29:31.909
Yes!

29:32.200 --> 29:34.120
But on the plus side,
she left way too much cash,

29:34.200 --> 29:35.997
so I think I'm gonna
get fucked up!

30:04.160 --> 30:05.593
Yeah, donut holes!

30:05.680 --> 30:07.200
I love these things.
How much are they?

30:07.240 --> 30:08.355
Um...

30:09.840 --> 30:10.909
Five cents.

30:11.000 --> 30:12.911
How about a dollar?

30:13.080 --> 30:14.672
What?

30:14.760 --> 30:16.637
Hey now, big spender.

30:17.160 --> 30:18.195
Thank you.

30:18.840 --> 30:19.955
Mmm.

30:20.280 --> 30:22.589
Why are these so good?
Caramel number six.

30:22.680 --> 30:23.908
Is that what it is?
Mmm-hmm.

30:24.640 --> 30:25.675
They're tasty.

30:26.720 --> 30:28.597
She's adorable.
Thank you.

30:28.720 --> 30:29.720
Mmm-hmm.

30:30.280 --> 30:31.280
Good to see you.

30:31.360 --> 30:33.112
Bye. Bye.

30:34.000 --> 30:36.594
Oh, my, oh, my, oh, my.
What do we have here?

30:36.680 --> 30:39.240
Are these store-bought
donut holes, Amy?

30:39.800 --> 30:41.199
What? No.

30:41.280 --> 30:42.998
Gosh, no,
I made them by hand

30:43.080 --> 30:46.072
and then I put them in the
weird plastic container.

30:46.160 --> 30:47.832
Oh, thank God.
'Cause we do not

30:47.920 --> 30:49.433
allow store-bought
holes.

30:49.560 --> 30:51.551
- Seriously, Vicky?
- Oh, come on, Gwendolyn.

30:51.640 --> 30:53.153
Who cares what
food people bring

30:53.240 --> 30:54.878
as long as it
raises money, right?

30:54.960 --> 30:57.110
Oh, did she just... Oh.
She did.

30:57.440 --> 30:58.873
Hit her with it, G.

30:59.000 --> 31:01.560
Well, you see,
I care, sweetie.

31:01.640 --> 31:03.870
I don't... I don't know what's
been going on with you,

31:03.960 --> 31:06.474
I mean, with your
weird outbursts

31:06.560 --> 31:09.074
and your terrible style,

31:09.160 --> 31:10.832
but it ends now.

31:11.160 --> 31:13.116
Okay? I run this school,

31:13.200 --> 31:16.988
and no one takes
a class or kicks a ball

31:17.080 --> 31:20.595
or plays a fuckin' clarinet
without my say-so.

31:21.520 --> 31:24.956
And I can make life
a living hell for you

31:25.040 --> 31:26.837
and your dirty
little children.

31:27.440 --> 31:28.793
Do you understand me?

31:28.880 --> 31:32.350
Wow, Gwendolyn, I genuinely think
you should just relax a little bit,

31:32.440 --> 31:34.635
I mean, have a donut hole.
They're delicious.

31:34.720 --> 31:36.870
They're from a gas station.
They're... Mmm.

31:37.400 --> 31:39.630
You have crossed
the line, little girl.

31:39.720 --> 31:41.597
And I am going
to destroy you.

31:42.960 --> 31:44.598
Winter is coming.

31:46.120 --> 31:47.155
Gwendolyn.

31:47.400 --> 31:49.834
Oh, my God.
You are so fucked.

31:50.440 --> 31:51.475
What...

31:51.960 --> 31:53.518
Bye.
Bye.

31:56.040 --> 31:57.439
Out of my way!

31:58.160 --> 31:59.388
I'm sorry, Gwendolyn.

32:03.720 --> 32:05.438
You psyched for
Mandarin class?

32:05.520 --> 32:06.714
No!
No.

32:06.800 --> 32:08.597
Mandarin class
is so stressful.

32:08.680 --> 32:10.875
Everyone just
barfs the whole time.

32:10.960 --> 32:12.791
Did you say "barfs"?
Yeah.

32:13.480 --> 32:14.833
Oh, my God.

32:14.960 --> 32:16.154
Wha...

32:16.840 --> 32:18.671
Why are we doing this?

32:21.800 --> 32:24.473
What are you doing?
Mandarin class is back that way!

32:24.560 --> 32:25.560
I know.

32:26.000 --> 32:27.479
But we're gonna
play hooky today.

32:33.160 --> 32:34.718
We cannot
afford this place.

32:34.800 --> 32:36.438
Don't worry.
I've got a plan.

32:39.400 --> 32:41.755
Shh. Get in here, you idiots.
We totally snuck in.

32:41.840 --> 32:43.990
I know! Shh. I can't believe
you have a real job.

32:44.080 --> 32:47.231
You're a lucky girl, Becky.
I would never do this for my kid.

32:47.360 --> 32:48.998
Yeah. My mom's
pretty cool.

32:50.200 --> 32:52.156
Also, my name's Jane.

32:52.280 --> 32:53.349
Okay.

32:53.440 --> 32:55.280
All right. Showers on
the left. Have fun, guys.

32:55.360 --> 32:56.873
Bye, Becky! Shh.
Okay, thanks, Carla.

32:57.680 --> 33:00.069
This place is fancy.
Gosh.

33:00.760 --> 33:02.318
Oh, look.
Free soap.

33:02.400 --> 33:03.628
No, honey,
don't take that.

33:03.720 --> 33:05.920
Oh, no, that's some good soap.
Take it, take it.

33:08.960 --> 33:11.758
This is what the tub looks like
after your brother takes a bath.

33:13.520 --> 33:15.272
You look like Kung Fu Panda.

33:18.160 --> 33:19.388
This is amazing.

33:19.520 --> 33:20.635
Mmm-hmm.

33:21.320 --> 33:23.197
We should get matching
tattoos after this.

33:25.000 --> 33:27.036
I'm really glad
we did this, Mom.

33:27.120 --> 33:29.873
I haven't felt this
relaxed in, like, ever.

33:30.560 --> 33:33.472
God, you needed a break from
school and soccer and...

33:34.440 --> 33:36.032
This whole Dad thing.

33:37.480 --> 33:38.708
What whole Dad thing?

33:39.600 --> 33:41.431
Nothing. Nothing!

33:41.840 --> 33:43.717
Does Dad
have a brain tumor?

33:43.800 --> 33:46.155
What? No!
No, no, no, no.

33:46.240 --> 33:48.037
God, no. Um...

33:48.360 --> 33:53.275
Your dad and I are going through
a rough patch right now.

33:54.080 --> 33:55.433
Are you guys
gonna get divorced?

33:55.520 --> 33:56.839
What? No, no, no.

33:56.920 --> 34:01.118
No. We're not getting
divorced right away.

34:01.760 --> 34:05.275
I just want you to know that
no matter what happens,

34:06.240 --> 34:07.275
it's not your fault.

34:07.800 --> 34:09.518
Why would it be
my fault?

34:09.600 --> 34:11.158
Why would you even
say that?

34:11.239 --> 34:12.239
I don't know!

34:12.360 --> 34:15.237
Oh, my God, baby, I'm so sorry!
I suck at this!

34:15.320 --> 34:17.436
I just don't
wanna be weird, okay?

34:17.560 --> 34:20.027
Baby, please don't cry. Please...
No, no, no, no, no.

34:20.159 --> 34:22.435
Honey, I need you to look at me,
just look at me, okay?

34:23.320 --> 34:24.753
Baby, baby...

34:25.760 --> 34:28.069
I need you to know
that your dad loves you.

34:28.520 --> 34:30.078
That I love you.

34:30.159 --> 34:35.234
And I promise you,
you will be fine.

34:37.239 --> 34:38.514
How do you know?

34:38.600 --> 34:39.998
Because I'm your mom,

34:41.080 --> 34:43.639
and I know you
better than anyone,

34:43.719 --> 34:45.710
and I know what
you're made of.

34:49.159 --> 34:50.717
Oh, honey.

34:50.800 --> 34:52.233
I love you.

34:53.800 --> 34:55.438
I love you, too.

34:59.080 --> 35:00.399
Hey, Coach?

35:01.320 --> 35:02.469
Coach!

35:03.200 --> 35:04.394
Fuck!

35:05.360 --> 35:06.998
Hi, Gwendolyn.
Hi, how are you?

35:07.440 --> 35:08.856
Listen, um,
I wanna talk to you about

35:08.880 --> 35:10.800
the starting lineup of
next week's game. Mmm-hmm.

35:10.840 --> 35:13.479
In particular, Amy
Mitchell's daughter, Jane.

35:13.600 --> 35:15.909
You know I can't discuss
specific players with you.

35:16.320 --> 35:18.231
And you know that
I chair the hiring

35:18.320 --> 35:20.151
and firing committee,
right?

35:20.240 --> 35:23.596
So let's stop dicking around and
let's get to the fucking point.

35:24.040 --> 35:25.837
Please don't get
me fired, Gwendolyn.

35:26.560 --> 35:28.312
My cat just died.
Oh.

35:28.400 --> 35:31.039
And I'm really very
fragile right now.

35:31.920 --> 35:33.353
Bench the little dork.

35:34.200 --> 35:35.428
Yeah, she's fuckin' gone.

35:36.120 --> 35:39.000
- I need this. This is my time.
- Do you know what I mean?

35:43.480 --> 35:44.993
Go for Carla.
Hey, it's Amy,

35:45.120 --> 35:47.416
I just found out Mike is staying
with his Internet girlfriend.

35:47.440 --> 35:49.954
Oh, fuck him!
We need to get you laid.

35:51.040 --> 35:52.109
I wanna get laid.

35:52.200 --> 35:53.200
I'm on my way.

35:57.400 --> 35:58.799
I'm so excited.

35:58.880 --> 36:00.536
Honey, I don't know,
what are you gonna wear?

36:00.560 --> 36:01.560
It's like a nun's closet.

36:01.840 --> 36:03.512
No, no, wait.
I got it, I got it.

36:03.640 --> 36:05.232
Let's see this!

36:05.840 --> 36:07.558
It's my favorite.

36:07.880 --> 36:08.880
I love it.

36:09.000 --> 36:12.310
No! No! Are you trying
to get laid or adopted?

36:12.720 --> 36:14.551
Oh.
Fair point.

36:14.640 --> 36:15.640
Ooh.

36:15.920 --> 36:16.989
Okay.

36:18.480 --> 36:21.313
That's what a lonely
person gets buried in.

36:21.400 --> 36:23.277
Fuck, you guys,
I literally have nothing, then.

36:23.360 --> 36:25.191
I have mom clothes,
I have work clothes.

36:25.280 --> 36:27.874
Okay, you know, let me get
in there one more time.

36:27.960 --> 36:29.736
I'm gonna find it. Move. Move.
Move, move, get me in here.

36:29.760 --> 36:31.720
I have jackets, I have lots of 'em.
We'll find it.

36:31.800 --> 36:33.256
We'll find something, honey.
Don't get discouraged.

36:33.280 --> 36:34.360
Okay. Okay.
You can do this.

36:34.440 --> 36:35.998
I mean, Jesus Christ!

36:36.080 --> 36:38.799
This is something that
Mrs. Doubtfire would wear.

36:38.880 --> 36:40.757
I love that movie.

36:40.840 --> 36:42.034
Me too.
Okay.

36:42.120 --> 36:43.200
It's such a good film.

36:43.240 --> 36:44.992
Wait a minute,
I see a spaghetti strap.

36:46.000 --> 36:49.709
No, hold on. This was, like, my slutty
Halloween costume from college.

36:49.800 --> 36:51.358
I like the word "slutty."
Put it on.

36:51.440 --> 36:52.839
Just try it.
Try it.

36:52.920 --> 36:55.434
You guys are ridiculous.
I'm telling you...

36:55.560 --> 36:58.199
Holy fuck!
Look at your mom bra! Ooh.

36:58.320 --> 37:00.675
There's so much
surface area.

37:00.760 --> 37:03.877
You can make three regular
bras out of this one mom bra.

37:03.960 --> 37:06.758
This isn't my mom bra.
This is my sexy bra.

37:07.000 --> 37:08.513
Shut up!

37:08.600 --> 37:10.113
Don't laugh.
Wait, are you serious?

37:10.200 --> 37:11.428
Yes!

37:11.520 --> 37:12.919
Oh, honey.
Amy.

37:13.040 --> 37:15.156
Oh! That looks like you
just got out of surgery.

37:15.240 --> 37:16.434
Is it that bad?

37:16.520 --> 37:19.159
Yeah, there's just one boob-log.
Yeah.

37:19.240 --> 37:20.798
You don't even
have two tits.

37:21.040 --> 37:23.240
I have this in black. Do you
guys wanna see it in black?

37:23.280 --> 37:24.429
No!
No!

37:24.600 --> 37:27.831
Oh, wow. This bra will be
the death of your vagina.

37:31.120 --> 37:32.120
Oh!

37:32.200 --> 37:33.269
Oh, my gosh.

37:33.360 --> 37:36.830
You guys, I've only handled
one penis my entire life.

37:36.920 --> 37:37.955
Oh, honey!

37:38.040 --> 37:40.315
What do I do if I get
a guy with a weird dick?

37:40.440 --> 37:41.839
Kent is a never-hard.

37:41.960 --> 37:43.598
Ooh.
What's a never-hard?

37:43.680 --> 37:45.511
Oh, he never
gets fully hard.

37:45.640 --> 37:50.236
So I just have to kind of fold his
penis up like a balloon animal

37:50.320 --> 37:52.151
and shove it up
in my vagina.

37:52.480 --> 37:54.516
- That sounds horrible!
- Yeah.

37:54.600 --> 37:57.034
Sometimes I take the balls
and shove 'em up there, too,

37:57.120 --> 37:59.350
because at least,
you know, they're firm.

37:59.440 --> 38:02.591
Honey, that is a lot of shit
to shove up your cooter.

38:02.680 --> 38:04.671
I mean, I'm just
happy he's circumcised.

38:04.840 --> 38:07.308
What if I get somebody
who's not circumcised?

38:07.400 --> 38:09.197
Run out of the room
screaming.

38:09.280 --> 38:10.872
It's like finding
a gun in the street.

38:10.960 --> 38:12.712
Just scream and
get outta there!

38:12.800 --> 38:14.995
No way, you guys.
Uncut guys are great.

38:15.080 --> 38:16.080
Really?

38:16.160 --> 38:17.480
Oh, they're always
so nice to you,

38:17.560 --> 38:19.056
because they know
their dicks are gross.

38:19.080 --> 38:20.195
How do I handle it?

38:20.280 --> 38:21.576
What, do I just touch it?
Oh, I'll show you. Here.

38:21.600 --> 38:23.496
Let me just, Kiki, do you mind for a sec?
Uh-uh. What?

38:23.520 --> 38:27.274
Just imagine for a second that
this is the hood of the uncut cock

38:27.400 --> 38:29.789
and then this is the penis face.
Okay? Mmm-hmm.

38:29.880 --> 38:32.110
So, what you would
do is very gently,

38:32.200 --> 38:36.512
you would just kind
of try to peel it back

38:37.120 --> 38:39.793
over like that to expose
the head of the cock.

38:39.960 --> 38:42.269
Okay. And then you
would just gently,

38:42.360 --> 38:43.816
you wanna, I'm sorry,
honey, you just wanna kind of,

38:43.840 --> 38:44.989
like it gets
a little tight,

38:45.080 --> 38:46.513
and you gotta
kind of work it,

38:46.600 --> 38:48.192
you know, you gotta work it off.

38:48.280 --> 38:50.669
And then you just go to town
like it's a, you know...

38:50.840 --> 38:52.717
You know,
you jerk it off

38:52.800 --> 38:53.915
till you wanna
sit on it.

38:54.040 --> 38:55.359
Okay? What do I do with this?

38:55.400 --> 38:57.595
What? Like, do I put it in a
hair clip or do I just...

38:57.680 --> 38:59.280
No, no, no, no, no, no.
No, no, no, this,

38:59.360 --> 39:00.536
this you can
flick it, suck it,

39:00.560 --> 39:01.656
you know,
rub your face on it.

39:01.680 --> 39:03.536
I don't wanna do that.
I don't wanna rub my face on it.

39:03.560 --> 39:05.516
Okay, well, take care of this, though.
Okay.

39:05.600 --> 39:08.558
'Cause this is like a big,
giant man clit.

39:08.640 --> 39:09.640
This, right here.

39:09.720 --> 39:11.790
If you work this,
it's gonna be like...

39:14.800 --> 39:16.376
Does that make sense, honey?
Yeah, it's great.

39:16.400 --> 39:17.536
Okay. Sure, sure, sure.
Thank you, honey.

39:17.560 --> 39:19.710
I'm not gonna wear this
sweatshirt ever again.

40:04.240 --> 40:06.595
Okay, okay, all right.
Let's get right down to it.

40:06.920 --> 40:08.216
What kind of guy
are you into, honey?

40:08.240 --> 40:11.437
You know what?
I've never been with a Latin man.

40:11.640 --> 40:13.278
If I were you,
I would start with maybe

40:13.360 --> 40:15.715
like just kind
of fat and Jewish,

40:15.800 --> 40:17.950
and then work yourself
into the Latin guy.

40:18.040 --> 40:19.439
Excuse me.
Okay.

40:19.960 --> 40:21.075
Hi, there.
Hi!

40:21.160 --> 40:22.160
Is this seat taken?

40:22.600 --> 40:24.113
Um, yes.

40:24.200 --> 40:26.919
I mean, yes, no,
like yes, sit, please. Yeah.

40:27.360 --> 40:29.032
What do I do?
Ask him about his hobbies.

40:30.120 --> 40:31.269
Hi.
Hi.

40:31.360 --> 40:33.794
Um, I'm Amy.
Braden.

40:33.880 --> 40:35.199
Braden, nice
to meet you, Braden.

40:35.280 --> 40:37.316
Nice to meet you.
I like your wedding ring.

40:37.440 --> 40:38.475
Shit!

40:38.600 --> 40:40.556
Um...

40:40.640 --> 40:43.359
Okay, you see,
this is a funny story.

40:43.440 --> 40:46.000
I was, um...
I was grocery shopping

40:46.080 --> 40:48.514
and I found it on the floor,
and I picked it up and...

40:48.920 --> 40:50.148
And then I put it on.

40:50.880 --> 40:52.438
I'm gonna sit somewhere else.
Okay.

40:53.480 --> 40:55.536
Ooh, maybe next time,
try it without your wedding ring.

40:55.560 --> 40:57.073
Oh, that's a great idea!
Yeah?

40:57.160 --> 40:58.673
Yes.
Hey, ladies.

40:58.760 --> 41:00.751
Hi! Where are you
comin' in from?

41:00.840 --> 41:03.752
Uh, we live in
Westbury with our kids.

41:04.760 --> 41:06.512
Great. Oh.

41:06.840 --> 41:08.496
Oh, forget it. I'm really nervous,
you guys.

41:08.520 --> 41:09.816
You're doing great.
I know, I know. There is...

41:09.840 --> 41:10.840
You're doing great.

41:10.960 --> 41:12.056
Look it, there is so
much cock in here...

41:12.080 --> 41:13.320
Yeah... that if
you literally...

41:13.360 --> 41:16.670
Just try to act half-normal
and you are gonna get laid.

41:16.800 --> 41:18.916
Just don't be such a mom.
Okay.

41:19.920 --> 41:21.353
You should eat more soup.

41:22.120 --> 41:25.157
Oh, I loved breastfeeding until
my nipples started cracking.

41:25.840 --> 41:28.274
This should prevent the
stain from setting, okay?

41:29.200 --> 41:31.031
Tupperware! Pinterest!

41:31.160 --> 41:32.878
Explosive diarrhea!

41:33.000 --> 41:34.319
Does your mom
know you're here?

41:34.920 --> 41:38.276
See, it wasn't just about a
dolphin getting a new tail.

41:38.360 --> 41:40.555
It was about a family
coming together.

41:44.840 --> 41:45.840
What did I say?

41:47.040 --> 41:48.189
Hey! Where are you going?

41:48.960 --> 41:50.029
Oh, my God, you guys.

41:50.120 --> 41:52.190
How'd it go?
Oh, horrible.

41:52.360 --> 41:53.696
What's the matter, hon?
What happened?

41:53.720 --> 41:56.393
I suck at this.
I just wanna go home.

41:56.480 --> 41:57.480
Oh!

41:57.560 --> 41:59.198
I really do.
Amy!

41:59.280 --> 42:00.280
Mmm.

42:01.520 --> 42:03.476
Jessie! What are you
guys doing here?

42:03.560 --> 42:06.597
We're just, you know, having
a little girls' night.

42:06.680 --> 42:09.672
Cool, so the husband's at home
with the kids? That's nice.

42:09.800 --> 42:11.119
Oh, mmm...

42:11.920 --> 42:14.150
My husband's not really
in the picture anymore.

42:14.240 --> 42:16.629
Yeah, yeah, she caught him
jerking off with a dairy farmer.

42:16.760 --> 42:18.193
He's a sex criminal.

42:18.440 --> 42:21.273
I don't know where to start.
Are you okay?

42:21.360 --> 42:23.590
I'm actually really,
really good. Yeah.

42:23.680 --> 42:26.194
I'm glad I ran into you.
This is really nice.

42:26.320 --> 42:27.833
Yeah, me too.

42:27.920 --> 42:28.920
Me too.

42:29.240 --> 42:30.719
Okay, creepy.
Let's go.

42:30.760 --> 42:32.512
Let's go, creepy.
Yeah.

42:32.720 --> 42:33.720
Okay.

42:34.000 --> 42:35.069
Have fun.

42:36.160 --> 42:38.116
You are so hard.

42:38.280 --> 42:39.872
Really, he's got
a hard body.

42:40.800 --> 42:43.189
Thank you. I think.

42:43.280 --> 42:45.840
I cannot believe Amy is
talking to Jessie Harkness.

42:45.920 --> 42:47.592
I have dreams about
him braiding my hair.

42:47.720 --> 42:48.896
Okay, can you not
stand so close to me?

42:48.920 --> 42:50.056
Because I'm still
trying to get laid.

42:50.080 --> 42:51.433
Yeah, sure.
No problem. Okay.

42:51.560 --> 42:52.959
And don't dance walk.

42:58.520 --> 43:00.795
You work at the, uh,
coffee company, right?

43:02.120 --> 43:04.429
What? Yeah. Wait,
how did you know?

43:04.600 --> 43:06.376
I might have asked around
about you a little bit.

43:06.400 --> 43:10.029
Wait. You asked about me?
Yeah.

43:10.120 --> 43:11.189
Yeah, I...

43:12.080 --> 43:14.548
Okay, I've kind of always
had a thing for you and...

43:14.760 --> 43:16.671
What?
I thought you knew that.

43:16.760 --> 43:19.638
No! I had no idea.
No? You had no idea?

43:19.760 --> 43:22.228
Oh, come on. You're like my
favorite mom at the school.

43:22.320 --> 43:24.040
I mean, I honestly don't
know how you do it.

43:24.120 --> 43:25.872
You take your kids
to all those activities,

43:25.960 --> 43:27.400
and you do all
those insane projects.

43:27.480 --> 43:30.074
I saw your Richard Nixon, by the way.
That was incredible.

43:30.160 --> 43:32.958
Well, you know what? I do have a
little thing for papier-mâché.

43:33.040 --> 43:34.632
It was really good.
Thank you.

43:34.760 --> 43:36.560
Oh, and are you kidding me
with those lunches?

43:36.640 --> 43:38.016
You know, my daughter's
always saying,

43:38.040 --> 43:39.456
"Why can't you make lunch
like Dylan's mom?"

43:39.480 --> 43:41.038
Oh, my God,
I love your daughter.

43:41.160 --> 43:42.752
You're making me look bad.
Oh, my God.

43:42.840 --> 43:45.593
Oh, this makes me
so happy.

43:45.680 --> 43:47.830
You know what's just
really amazing, though,

43:47.920 --> 43:50.115
is the fact that your kids
are actually nice people.

43:50.280 --> 43:52.589
Meh, eh...
No, no, I'm serious!

43:52.680 --> 43:56.832
Anyone could force their kids
to play cello or speak Chinese

43:56.960 --> 43:59.320
or, you know, go to a fancy college,
or something like that,

43:59.400 --> 44:02.710
but what's really
hard is raising kids

44:02.800 --> 44:04.392
who are actually
decent and kind

44:04.480 --> 44:07.040
and somehow
you've done that.

44:07.560 --> 44:08.656
And you should
be really proud.

44:08.680 --> 44:10.318
You're a fuckin'
great mom.

44:13.560 --> 44:15.391
Oh, oh...

44:15.880 --> 44:18.030
Oh, my.
I'm so sorry.

44:18.160 --> 44:20.176
It's fine. Don't worry about it.
And I'm so embarrassed.

44:20.200 --> 44:24.352
You kind of nailed my face, but
we should probably do it again.

44:24.480 --> 44:26.596
Are you sure?
Just no sudden movements.

44:27.880 --> 44:29.199
Just nice and slow.

44:35.160 --> 44:37.037
Carla. Carla!
What, hon?

44:37.160 --> 44:38.176
Carla, look, look,
look, look!

44:38.200 --> 44:39.200
No, Kiki.

44:39.360 --> 44:40.873
No, Kiki!
Kiki, no, no.

45:15.600 --> 45:16.999
Mike!
Hey, babe!

45:17.080 --> 45:19.833
What are you doing?
I wanna get back together.

45:19.920 --> 45:23.071
I never should've left you.
That was a total dick move.

45:23.880 --> 45:27.350
And I feel like we should
just put that in the past

45:27.440 --> 45:28.759
and not talk about it.

45:29.440 --> 45:31.635
Wait, what are you
talking about?

45:31.720 --> 45:34.439
Look, I...

45:35.400 --> 45:36.833
I just needed a break.

45:36.960 --> 45:38.518
Haven't you ever
needed a break?

45:38.960 --> 45:41.030
Of course I have, Mike.

45:41.120 --> 45:43.395
But I didn't break up
our family to do it.

45:45.600 --> 45:46.749
I miss the kids.

45:47.640 --> 45:48.709
So much.

45:48.800 --> 45:51.360
Mostly Dylan, but even
Jane a little bit, too.

45:51.440 --> 45:53.874
And the dog,
God, I miss Roscoe so much.

45:53.960 --> 45:55.712
How is he doing?
He's fine.

45:55.800 --> 45:58.553
Thank God.
The bottom line is,

45:58.640 --> 46:01.393
I will do whatever it takes
to keep this family together.

46:02.400 --> 46:03.400
Really?

46:04.480 --> 46:05.920
You'll finally go
to therapy with me?

46:05.960 --> 46:08.872
I knew you were gonna say that!
Therapy is so dumb!

46:08.960 --> 46:10.473
Great. Get out!
Have fun. Bye-bye.

46:10.560 --> 46:11.616
Hey! I'm trying to
do the right thing!

46:11.640 --> 46:13.437
Bye-bye, Mike.
Honestly!

46:13.520 --> 46:14.669
All right, you know what?

46:14.760 --> 46:17.638
Even though it's a total waste of
time and money, I will go to therapy.

46:17.760 --> 46:21.992
But when I say go, I mean, like
actually go, like participate, cry.

46:22.120 --> 46:24.554
I haven't cried since the
Cubbies lost it all in '03.

46:24.640 --> 46:25.816
How do you expect me...
Mike, you know what?

46:25.840 --> 46:27.896
Have fun with your little weirdo
girlfriend on the Internet.

46:27.920 --> 46:30.480
But wait, are we gonna
go to therapy or what?

46:30.600 --> 46:31.669
I'll think about it.

46:43.920 --> 46:44.989
Hey.

46:49.520 --> 46:52.193
Honey? Honey,
are you okay?

46:52.280 --> 46:55.431
Coach says I'm not starting.
I'm a benchwarmer.

46:55.520 --> 46:57.715
Wait, what?
No, that's impossible.

46:57.800 --> 46:59.438
You're the best
forward on that team.

46:59.520 --> 47:01.736
Oh, my God, my life is ruined.
I'm never going to college.

47:01.760 --> 47:03.751
I might as well
just become a teacher.

47:03.880 --> 47:05.677
Baby, baby,
look at me for one second.

47:05.800 --> 47:08.189
You'll be okay. I promise
you I'm gonna handle this.

47:08.560 --> 47:09.959
Okay?
Okay.

47:10.040 --> 47:11.109
Okay.

47:11.200 --> 47:12.428
Just please
don't make a scene.

47:12.840 --> 47:15.035
Honey, I would
never embarrass you.

47:19.720 --> 47:21.073
Gwendolyn made me do it!

47:21.200 --> 47:22.336
Oh, my God.
Are you kidding me?

47:22.360 --> 47:24.396
What is it with
you moms?

47:24.480 --> 47:26.948
I am a middle school
soccer coach.

47:27.040 --> 47:28.553
All I wanna do

47:28.680 --> 47:32.639
is make enough money to feed my
cats and fill my fuckin' Prius.

47:32.720 --> 47:34.995
Grow some balls! Jesus!

47:35.840 --> 47:36.840
Hey!

47:38.520 --> 47:39.720
How dare you
bench my daughter?

47:39.880 --> 47:41.598
Oh, hi, Amy.

47:41.680 --> 47:43.477
You have no right
to do that.

47:43.960 --> 47:45.473
Oh, actually, I do,

47:45.560 --> 47:48.438
uh, because soccer
is a PTA-sponsored activity

47:48.520 --> 47:51.830
and I am the president
of the PTA. So...

47:52.680 --> 47:55.114
Oh... Okay.

47:55.480 --> 47:56.629
Uh...

47:57.680 --> 47:58.954
Well, um...

48:01.000 --> 48:02.149
Not for long.

48:02.240 --> 48:04.595
Oh, dear.
What does that mean?

48:04.680 --> 48:07.274
That means I'm gonna run
against you for PTA president.

48:07.360 --> 48:08.998
Oh.

48:11.440 --> 48:13.670
Amy's husband
just recently left her,

48:14.520 --> 48:17.273
so she's kind of having
a mental breakdown right now.

48:17.440 --> 48:19.237
Oh, that's so sad.

48:19.880 --> 48:20.880
Ooh.

48:24.600 --> 48:26.511
You're goin' down.

48:26.600 --> 48:27.669
No, honey,

48:28.080 --> 48:31.356
the only thing going down is
your husband on another woman.

48:31.720 --> 48:32.948
Well, damn.

48:35.520 --> 48:37.397
This is
a terrible idea, Amy.

48:37.840 --> 48:39.558
There's no way
you can beat her.

48:39.640 --> 48:42.359
Gwendolyn has been president of
the PTA for the last six years.

48:42.480 --> 48:46.712
Kiki, she messed with my kid. I
can't let that stand. Come on!

48:47.360 --> 48:49.032
Right, but all
the different mom groups

48:49.120 --> 48:50.240
are gonna vote
for Gwendolyn.

48:50.280 --> 48:53.238
She's got the attachment moms,
she's got the tiger moms,

48:53.320 --> 48:54.389
the sad moms.

48:54.480 --> 48:56.391
She has the blogging moms.

48:56.480 --> 48:57.629
She's got the CrossFit moms.

48:57.720 --> 48:58.720
Camel toe moms.

48:59.160 --> 49:00.388
She's got the drunk moms.

49:00.480 --> 49:01.708
The moms
that you wanna fuck.

49:01.800 --> 49:03.313
The moms that
used to be dads.

49:03.440 --> 49:05.715
She has the moms that
always have a limb broken.

49:05.800 --> 49:08.109
The hairy moms.
The wearable art moms.

49:08.200 --> 49:09.713
The juicing moms.
Mmm-hmm.

49:09.840 --> 49:11.990
She has the moms
with the huge areolas.

49:12.080 --> 49:15.516
The black moms, the lesbian moms,
the divorced moms.

49:15.640 --> 49:18.029
She even has the divorced
black lesbian moms.

49:18.120 --> 49:19.758
That is a really
hard group to get.

49:19.840 --> 49:21.159
I love those girls.

49:21.240 --> 49:25.472
Plus, Amy, if you lose,
she'll destroy you.

49:25.600 --> 49:28.672
She'll put your kids in all the
dumb classes with all the dum-dums.

49:28.800 --> 49:30.096
She'll give 'em
the crappy teachers.

49:30.120 --> 49:32.759
You can forget about soccer,
she won't even give your kids milk.

49:32.840 --> 49:36.435
But that's all the more reason
we have to bring her down.

49:36.520 --> 49:38.476
I mean,
you guys, she's a bully!

49:38.560 --> 49:41.438
Okay, she wants us all to be
these perfect little Nazi-moms

49:41.520 --> 49:44.671
and our kids to be hyper-stressed
and over-scheduled.

49:44.760 --> 49:48.673
My daughter gets a new rash
every week, and she's 12.

49:48.760 --> 49:50.034
You had me at Nazi.

49:50.520 --> 49:54.274
I say we go punch that
chick right in the tits.

49:54.360 --> 49:55.588
Yes!

49:58.720 --> 50:01.188
Would you like a new
PTA president? Me too!

50:01.320 --> 50:03.550
Hi. Meet the Candidate Night
tomorrow night, 7:30.

50:03.680 --> 50:06.035
Here, honey. Take one.
Vote for Amy. Really?

50:06.160 --> 50:07.479
Amy Mitchell.
PTA president.

50:07.560 --> 50:09.869
Come tomorrow, 7:30,
Meet the Candidate Night.

50:10.000 --> 50:11.000
PTA president.

50:11.120 --> 50:13.031
No! No, thank you!
Take it!

50:13.200 --> 50:15.031
Okay!
Great!

50:17.520 --> 50:20.034
I'll fuck your husband if you don't go.
I'll fuck him!

50:20.160 --> 50:21.229
Vote for Amy!

50:21.320 --> 50:22.389
Carla, get her!

50:23.280 --> 50:24.998
Hey! Hey!

50:25.080 --> 50:27.310
Don't you fuckin' run from me!
Don't you fuckin'...

50:27.480 --> 50:28.674
Ah!

50:32.600 --> 50:33.874
It's so cute.

50:36.000 --> 50:37.376
So, how many people
do you think are coming

50:37.400 --> 50:38.674
to the Meet
the Candidate Night?

50:38.760 --> 50:40.478
Well, I told all the
moms that I would

50:40.560 --> 50:42.835
bang their husbands if
they didn't show up, so...

50:43.000 --> 50:45.070
Carla.
A lot. My answer is a lot.

50:45.400 --> 50:46.594
Thank you, Kiki.

50:48.640 --> 50:50.676
Oh, Jesus, you guys,
look at the kids.

50:50.760 --> 50:52.671
My daughter
won't stop studying.

50:52.760 --> 50:53.760
Oh, feel lucky.

50:54.160 --> 50:56.879
All my kid wants to do with
books is rip 'em in half.

50:59.000 --> 51:01.036
I just wish I knew
how I was doing, you know?

51:01.600 --> 51:03.875
Yeah, that's the worst part
about being a mom, though,

51:03.960 --> 51:06.793
is you don't know whether or
not you're doing a good job

51:06.880 --> 51:08.199
until they're fully grown.

51:08.280 --> 51:10.111
And by that point,
it's too late.

51:10.240 --> 51:12.151
Your kid
is either a nice guy

51:12.240 --> 51:14.595
or he's giving hand
jobs in an alley for rent.

51:14.720 --> 51:16.480
I don't think those
are the only two options.

51:20.040 --> 51:22.349
Yesterday, I gave
Bernard the wrong juice box

51:22.440 --> 51:24.874
and he called me
a dumb bitch.

51:24.960 --> 51:26.552
Oh, my God.
Okay.

51:26.640 --> 51:30.474
My kid still watches Sesame
Street and he doesn't get it.

51:32.600 --> 51:34.431
My daughter's
scared of balloons.

51:34.960 --> 51:36.473
My kid eats
butter like an entrée.

51:36.600 --> 51:38.238
You gonna eat
your butter?

51:38.320 --> 51:40.120
My daughter stole money
from a homeless woman.

51:41.280 --> 51:42.872
My son failed study hall.

51:42.960 --> 51:44.791
Claire killed
our neighbor's ferret.

51:44.880 --> 51:48.077
I mean, we all pretended like it
was an accident, but it wasn't.

51:49.160 --> 51:50.479
She's a killer.

51:53.480 --> 51:54.480
Ugh.

51:56.120 --> 51:59.556
I know we make fun of them, but
fuck, I love them so much.

51:59.640 --> 52:00.640
Me too.

52:01.000 --> 52:03.309
I would literally
die for them right now.

52:03.440 --> 52:04.953
Oh, you're making me cry.

52:05.040 --> 52:07.156
I'm already there.
I mean, oh, my God,

52:07.320 --> 52:09.390
you guys,
children are such a gift.

52:09.520 --> 52:11.033
Every time I think
about that big,

52:11.120 --> 52:13.031
dumb motherfucker
going off to college,

52:13.120 --> 52:14.519
I wanna cry like a baby.

52:25.360 --> 52:26.429
This sucks.

52:26.520 --> 52:27.960
I can't believe
you're making me cook

52:28.040 --> 52:29.917
my own breakfast
every single day.

52:30.400 --> 52:33.119
You're doing awesome, buddy.
You really are.

52:33.360 --> 52:35.157
Hey, so where's
my science project?

52:35.600 --> 52:37.113
Oh, I didn't do it.

52:37.200 --> 52:38.519
What? But it's due today.

52:38.600 --> 52:40.511
Yeah. Yeah.
That's so unfair!

52:40.640 --> 52:42.358
I know. I know.
I'm so sorry.

52:42.480 --> 52:43.976
But you're gonna
actually have to start

52:44.000 --> 52:45.479
doing your own
homework from now on.

52:46.520 --> 52:48.636
I am a slow learner,
remember?

52:48.720 --> 52:51.996
You're not a slow learner.
You're just entitled.

52:53.480 --> 52:55.080
Honey, do you know
what "entitled" means?

52:55.760 --> 52:57.796
No. Because
I'm a slow learner.

52:58.760 --> 53:03.117
It means that Mommy and Daddy
have been spoiling you,

53:03.240 --> 53:06.152
and now you think the
world owes you something,

53:06.240 --> 53:08.071
but it doesn't.

53:08.160 --> 53:10.310
And if you don't learn
how to work hard now,

53:10.400 --> 53:13.676
then you're just gonna grow up to
be like another entitled white dude

53:13.760 --> 53:16.115
who thinks he's awesome
for no reason.

53:16.200 --> 53:18.156
And then you'll start
a ska band,

53:18.240 --> 53:21.516
and it'll be awful, and
you'll be mean to girls,

53:21.600 --> 53:25.195
and you'll grow this ironic
mustache to look interesting,

53:25.280 --> 53:28.317
but you won't actually be interesting,
and I'm not okay with that.

53:28.400 --> 53:32.712
So will you please, please,
just do your own homework?

53:34.160 --> 53:35.832
Fine. Jesus!

53:35.920 --> 53:36.989
Great.

53:41.680 --> 53:42.999
I love you.

53:47.040 --> 53:48.519
So where are
your kids tonight?

53:48.600 --> 53:50.096
Oh, they're staying
at a friend's house.

53:50.120 --> 53:51.872
I gave my kid $10
and a cell phone

53:51.960 --> 53:53.200
and I dropped
him off at Arby's.

53:53.240 --> 53:54.753
He'll be fine
for hours.

53:56.720 --> 53:57.755
Somebody's here.

53:57.880 --> 53:59.074
- Amy for president!
- Yes!

54:01.320 --> 54:03.311
Hi. Nice to meet you.

54:03.560 --> 54:06.597
Thank you
so much for coming.

54:06.720 --> 54:09.632
I didn't want her
to bang my husband.

54:10.600 --> 54:12.033
No, she was
just kidding.

54:12.240 --> 54:13.240
Oh.

54:13.320 --> 54:14.958
I wasn't kidding.

54:15.960 --> 54:16.960
Ugh.

54:17.640 --> 54:19.631
Come in, come in. I'm
sorry, nobody's here yet.

54:19.920 --> 54:23.117
Yeah, well, I figured, what with
Gwendolyn's party and everything.

54:24.360 --> 54:26.316
I'm sorry,
what did you say?

54:26.880 --> 54:28.791
Oh, nuts.

54:29.080 --> 54:30.229
You didn't know.

54:30.320 --> 54:34.074
Gwendolyn decided to throw a
competing party at her house.

54:34.160 --> 54:36.628
And she has Martha Stewart.

54:37.920 --> 54:40.150
How would you like to try
these special meatballs?

54:40.240 --> 54:41.976
Now, I don't have anything
nice to say to anyone,

54:42.000 --> 54:43.560
but I have to tell you,
I just love you.

54:43.640 --> 54:46.074
I've always wanted
to be you, actually.

54:46.160 --> 54:47.195
Yes.
Oh.

54:47.600 --> 54:48.919
Martha, sweetheart.
Hi, hi.

54:49.000 --> 54:52.072
Everything
looks so beautiful.

54:52.160 --> 54:54.754
Well, thank you so much,
and how's Blaire and Gandhi?

54:54.840 --> 54:57.400
It's been nice talking to you,
Martha, but I have things to do.

54:57.520 --> 54:58.589
Stop talking to her.
Okay.

54:58.680 --> 55:01.353
Um, ladies? Hi, can I get
your attention, please?

55:01.440 --> 55:03.749
- Eyes here so I know you're hearing me.
- Shh.

55:03.840 --> 55:06.479
Listen, the program is gonna
begin in about five minutes,

55:06.560 --> 55:08.596
so take your
assigned seats, okay?

55:09.360 --> 55:10.713
Right now. Do it right now.

55:11.160 --> 55:12.832
I can't believe
Gwendolyn would do this.

55:12.960 --> 55:14.473
I'm so sorry, sweetie.

55:16.480 --> 55:19.313
You guys, what are we gonna
do with all this shitty wine?

55:19.680 --> 55:21.750
For the next two hours,
I'm gonna talk to you guys

55:21.880 --> 55:24.314
about the advantages
of year-round school.

55:25.240 --> 55:28.949
We need to change
our children's future

55:29.040 --> 55:33.511
by making them go to
school 365 days a year.

55:35.360 --> 55:36.634
Three, two, one, go!

55:36.720 --> 55:37.789
Catfish!

55:37.880 --> 55:38.880
Did she say it?

55:38.960 --> 55:40.016
Drink again!
Drink again, drink again!

55:40.040 --> 55:41.536
Why am I the one
that's always drinking?

55:41.560 --> 55:43.118
Because you
said the clue word.

55:43.200 --> 55:44.394
That's when
you say it.

55:44.520 --> 55:45.640
I don't understand
this game.

55:45.720 --> 55:47.551
It's not a reading game!

55:47.680 --> 55:48.715
Okay, go.

55:48.800 --> 55:50.472
- Amy.
- What?

55:50.560 --> 55:52.710
Emu!
No, Amy!

55:54.000 --> 55:55.479
It said fuckin' "emu"!

55:55.880 --> 55:57.552
You're not good at this.

55:57.640 --> 55:59.835
Drink!
Drink again!

56:00.560 --> 56:02.915
I'm gonna take you
back a little bit.

56:03.720 --> 56:04.994
Genghis Khan.

56:05.080 --> 56:06.957
Do you think he had
year-round schooling?

56:07.560 --> 56:08.993
I think not.

56:09.080 --> 56:10.832
Skip forward a little bit.

56:10.920 --> 56:12.478
Osama bin Laden.

56:13.040 --> 56:15.200
He didn't have year-round school.

56:15.600 --> 56:17.397
There's nothing more dangerous

56:17.480 --> 56:19.550
than summer vacation.

56:20.800 --> 56:22.640
- Okay, ladies?
- Yeah, let's go.

56:25.360 --> 56:28.352
Hi, I'm Amy, nice to see you.
Come in, come in, come in.

56:28.920 --> 56:30.558
Wow, there's
a lot of you.

56:31.320 --> 56:32.320
Ooh.

56:37.440 --> 56:38.736
Are you sure you can't
stay a little bit longer?

56:38.760 --> 56:40.352
I've only got my sitter until 9:00.
Oh.

56:40.440 --> 56:42.112
So I have to
skedaddle right now.

56:42.200 --> 56:43.520
Okay. No, I understand.
I'm a mom.

56:44.280 --> 56:45.416
I had such a great night.
Bye!

56:45.440 --> 56:46.680
We'll see you
over there.

56:46.880 --> 56:49.269
Well, that ended a lot
earlier than I anticipated.

56:49.360 --> 56:50.360
Yeah.

56:51.600 --> 56:52.616
You don't think
they're all going over

56:52.640 --> 56:54.756
to Amy's party, do you?

56:54.840 --> 56:57.434
Vicky, we had Martha fuckin'
Stewart here tonight.

56:57.520 --> 56:58.999
Who does Amy
have, hmm?

57:01.960 --> 57:03.560
I'll drive. She could
have a point, yeah.

57:05.960 --> 57:07.393
This party is raging.

57:07.480 --> 57:08.595
What a turnout.

57:08.960 --> 57:11.474
Hi, would you ladies
like a Jell-O shot?

57:11.560 --> 57:14.120
Is that...
Is that...

57:14.240 --> 57:15.639
Martha Stewart?

57:15.760 --> 57:17.159
- Thank you.
- Martha.

57:17.560 --> 57:18.879
- Oh, my God.
- Good, right?

57:18.960 --> 57:20.393
I'm cumming.

57:20.480 --> 57:22.710
Oh, my God.
What's in this?

57:22.800 --> 57:25.553
Well, it's bespoke
lingonberry gelatin...

57:25.640 --> 57:27.631
Mmm.
...and a shitload of vodka.

57:29.160 --> 57:30.309
They're delicious.

57:30.400 --> 57:32.595
I start my day
with six of these.

57:35.480 --> 57:37.471
Drink! Drink!

57:37.640 --> 57:40.279
Drink! Drink! Drink!

58:09.440 --> 58:10.668
Whoo!

58:39.240 --> 58:40.240
Whoo!

59:14.440 --> 59:16.078
Holy shit.

59:21.080 --> 59:24.197
Is that Jennifer Noonan
peeing behind that car?

59:24.280 --> 59:25.508
Oh, my goodness.

59:25.600 --> 59:27.750
This party
looks awesome!

59:28.320 --> 59:29.435
I need to go
to this party.

59:29.520 --> 59:30.635
What? Vicky!
Whoo!

59:31.400 --> 59:33.675
Please, shut up!
Just shut up for one second.

59:33.760 --> 59:37.275
I know it's a school night, so we're
just gonna get right down to it.

59:37.400 --> 59:41.951
I wanna introduce you
to your next PTA president...

59:43.640 --> 59:45.949
Amy Mitchell!

59:49.480 --> 59:50.959
Yes!

59:54.840 --> 59:56.240
First of all,
I just wanna say this,

59:56.320 --> 01:00:00.791
that I think that we, as moms,
do way too much stuff.

01:00:01.320 --> 01:00:06.633
And if I'm elected, I promise
you we are gonna do way less.

01:00:06.880 --> 01:00:07.880
Whoo!

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:12.278
Right? Less PTA meetings,
less luncheons, less fuckin' bake sales,

01:00:12.360 --> 01:00:14.430
just less bullshit!

01:00:17.160 --> 01:00:18.275
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

01:00:18.360 --> 01:00:20.256
And I think that our kids
need a break, too, you guys.

01:00:20.280 --> 01:00:23.670
Come on, now, school starts
way too fucking early, okay?

01:00:23.760 --> 01:00:25.360
God, and they have
way too much homework.

01:00:25.400 --> 01:00:26.456
I mean, our kids
don't even have time

01:00:26.480 --> 01:00:27.959
to be kids anymore,
am I right?

01:00:30.320 --> 01:00:32.675
And what is up with these five
standardized tests a week?

01:00:32.800 --> 01:00:35.917
We should not be teaching our
kids how to be good test-takers.

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:38.719
We should be teaching them
how to be good people!

01:00:40.520 --> 01:00:42.590
What is
a standardized test?

01:00:42.680 --> 01:00:46.275
So, if you're a mom who's
overworked, overstressed,

01:00:46.360 --> 01:00:50.194
or if you're just a mom
who wants to do less...

01:00:50.520 --> 01:00:51.669
Yes!

01:00:52.440 --> 01:00:53.953
Then just vote for me.

01:01:00.520 --> 01:01:03.910
Amy! Amy! Amy! Amy! Amy!

01:01:04.040 --> 01:01:05.632
This basic bitch
right here,

01:01:05.720 --> 01:01:07.073
she's gonna win
the election.

01:01:07.720 --> 01:01:09.199
No, she's not.

01:01:09.320 --> 01:01:11.834
Because I'm going to
hit her where it counts.

01:01:12.640 --> 01:01:14.551
You're gonna punch her
in the vagina?

01:01:14.640 --> 01:01:17.473
I literally don't know why we
hang out with you anymore.

01:01:27.360 --> 01:01:29.874
Do you know the best thing
about mom parties?

01:01:29.960 --> 01:01:32.394
They end at exactly
11:00.

01:01:33.800 --> 01:01:36.234
I made out with
so many women tonight.

01:01:36.480 --> 01:01:38.516
- I know.
- Guys...

01:01:39.320 --> 01:01:41.550
I really
like whippets.

01:01:42.760 --> 01:01:43.909
Hello?

01:01:46.440 --> 01:01:48.078
Wow. Hey.

01:01:49.320 --> 01:01:50.833
What are you doing here?

01:01:52.400 --> 01:01:55.312
Well, you kind of
booty texted me.

01:01:55.720 --> 01:01:56.720
Uh...

01:01:57.240 --> 01:02:00.357
What? It was a great party, Am.
So, uh...

01:02:00.760 --> 01:02:02.079
Okay.
You got all this, right?

01:02:02.160 --> 01:02:04.071
Hi, Jessie.
I really like your clothes.

01:02:05.240 --> 01:02:06.434
That was odd.

01:02:06.880 --> 01:02:08.280
I'm so sorry.

01:02:09.560 --> 01:02:10.560
Um...

01:02:11.560 --> 01:02:15.872
I actually think Carla may have
booty texted you off my phone.

01:02:16.040 --> 01:02:18.315
Oh, okay.
Okay, that makes sense

01:02:18.400 --> 01:02:21.517
because what she wrote
was fuckin' disturbing.

01:02:21.600 --> 01:02:23.511
Sorry.
It's okay.

01:02:24.280 --> 01:02:25.952
Um, I don't know.

01:02:27.280 --> 01:02:28.429
Should I leave?

01:02:30.720 --> 01:02:31.869
No.

01:02:35.760 --> 01:02:36.988
Uh...

01:02:37.480 --> 01:02:39.516
I was really
hoping you'd say that.

01:02:48.800 --> 01:02:51.712
So what exactly
did Carla text you?

01:02:53.920 --> 01:02:55.148
Why don't I show you?

01:02:55.400 --> 01:02:56.628
Oh.

01:02:57.400 --> 01:02:58.435
Okay.

01:03:06.040 --> 01:03:07.553
Oh, yes!

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:18.673
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

01:03:19.640 --> 01:03:20.993
Oh, that was...

01:03:21.120 --> 01:03:22.838
Unbelievable.
I can't...

01:03:24.600 --> 01:03:25.749
What was that...
Wow.

01:03:25.840 --> 01:03:27.273
That thing you did
at the end?

01:03:27.440 --> 01:03:29.192
I don't know.

01:03:29.280 --> 01:03:31.430
I kind of came up
with it in the moment.

01:03:31.520 --> 01:03:32.555
Was it okay?

01:03:32.680 --> 01:03:34.352
Oh, my God, it was amazing!
Yeah?

01:03:34.480 --> 01:03:36.914
That was by far the best I've ever had.
Oh, God.

01:03:37.040 --> 01:03:38.439
Oh, I was so worried.

01:03:38.520 --> 01:03:40.400
You know, it's been awhile
since I've done this.

01:03:40.680 --> 01:03:42.591
I think I got pregnant.

01:03:42.680 --> 01:03:45.240
Oh, my God.
Really. Hey.

01:03:45.360 --> 01:03:48.238
Hi, yeah. Can I go down
on you again?

01:03:48.520 --> 01:03:50.431
Oh, yeah,
that'd be great.

01:03:50.520 --> 01:03:51.635
Cool.
Okay.

01:03:51.720 --> 01:03:53.517
Okay. Okay.
Oh, my God.

01:03:53.840 --> 01:03:55.558
Okay.
All right.

01:03:55.680 --> 01:03:56.680
Oh.
Mmm.

01:03:57.200 --> 01:03:59.031
Oh.

01:03:59.120 --> 01:04:00.872
Oh, look at you go.

01:04:05.560 --> 01:04:07.039
God,
it's dark in here.

01:04:09.720 --> 01:04:12.553
God. I still don't
understand what we're doing.

01:04:12.640 --> 01:04:15.234
Stop it. You guys never
tell me what we're...

01:04:20.840 --> 01:04:22.910
Vicky, why are
you so fuckin' stupid?

01:04:26.160 --> 01:04:30.915
I like to start by saying that
every marriage is savable.

01:04:31.040 --> 01:04:33.349
You just need two people who
are willing to work at it.

01:04:33.760 --> 01:04:34.760
Okay?

01:04:35.200 --> 01:04:38.078
Mike, Amy, I want you
to look at each other

01:04:38.160 --> 01:04:41.914
and say three things that
you like about each other.

01:04:43.960 --> 01:04:45.029
Mike?

01:04:45.120 --> 01:04:48.032
Can I go second?
Okay. Yeah, sure.

01:04:48.280 --> 01:04:49.918
Uh, Amy?

01:04:50.240 --> 01:04:54.756
Okay, uh, Mike, I like that
you gave me my children.

01:04:55.200 --> 01:04:57.668
Uh, I like that you pick them
up from school sometimes.

01:04:57.760 --> 01:05:00.115
It's actually
really helpful.

01:05:00.640 --> 01:05:04.713
And, uh, I like that you
came to therapy today.

01:05:05.320 --> 01:05:07.436
- Okay, Mike. Your turn.
- Okay.

01:05:07.920 --> 01:05:10.388
I like your spaghetti.

01:05:11.800 --> 01:05:13.836
And you make
pretty good calzone.

01:05:15.960 --> 01:05:16.960
Was that three?

01:05:17.280 --> 01:05:20.909
That was like one
and then 1A.

01:05:22.160 --> 01:05:25.789
You know what? Um...
Let's try some role playing.

01:05:26.560 --> 01:05:28.915
All right, Amy, I want you
to pretend to be Mike,

01:05:29.560 --> 01:05:32.711
and Mike, I want you
to pretend to be Amy.

01:05:33.280 --> 01:05:35.236
Okay? And now
I just want you to

01:05:35.320 --> 01:05:37.675
just tell me
about your day.

01:05:39.800 --> 01:05:41.199
Hi, I'm Amy.

01:05:41.800 --> 01:05:45.793
All I did today was, like,
rub lotion on my face

01:05:46.160 --> 01:05:49.391
and talk, talk, talk, talk.

01:05:49.480 --> 01:05:50.595
Okay. Uh...

01:05:51.480 --> 01:05:53.596
Amy, would you like to...
Yes, I would!

01:05:56.120 --> 01:05:57.872
Hey, I'm Mike.

01:05:58.320 --> 01:05:59.320
Um...

01:05:59.440 --> 01:06:00.873
My life is awesome

01:06:00.960 --> 01:06:04.157
because my wife takes care of
everything in the world for me.

01:06:04.280 --> 01:06:06.271
This is the problem!
Here's the bottom line!

01:06:06.360 --> 01:06:07.918
She's a perfectionist.

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:09.256
So what's the point
of even trying, okay?

01:06:09.280 --> 01:06:10.315
How is that a problem?

01:06:10.400 --> 01:06:11.913
And she hasn't
given me a blowie

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:13.592
since my birthday
five years ago!

01:06:13.680 --> 01:06:15.536
Are you fucking kidding me?
Which is so not cool!

01:06:15.560 --> 01:06:16.788
Hold on one second!

01:06:16.880 --> 01:06:18.154
You want a blowie?

01:06:18.240 --> 01:06:21.277
Maybe if you cleaned the kitchen,
made the kids dinner,

01:06:21.360 --> 01:06:23.749
cared for someone
other than yourself,

01:06:23.840 --> 01:06:25.016
I would give you
so many blowies

01:06:25.040 --> 01:06:26.439
your fuckin'
dick would explode.

01:06:26.520 --> 01:06:28.656
My dick would never explode
'cause it's indestructible.

01:06:28.680 --> 01:06:31.558
Oh, my God, I can't deal with you!
I can't fucking look at you.

01:06:31.640 --> 01:06:32.640
I'm...

01:06:33.520 --> 01:06:34.873
Mike, I...

01:06:34.960 --> 01:06:36.439
I don't love you anymore.

01:06:36.520 --> 01:06:39.034
I'm so sorry,
but I just don't.

01:06:39.160 --> 01:06:41.674
I'm so sick and tired
of pretending like I do.

01:06:42.920 --> 01:06:46.549
That is exactly how I feel.

01:06:52.360 --> 01:06:53.360
Okay...

01:06:54.200 --> 01:06:58.239
Remember when I said that
all marriages are savable?

01:07:00.360 --> 01:07:02.316
Well, it ain't gonna
happen for you guys.

01:07:03.720 --> 01:07:05.392
So what do you
think we should do?

01:07:05.760 --> 01:07:09.230
Well, as a therapist, I'm not
allowed to tell you what to do,

01:07:09.360 --> 01:07:13.672
but as a human being with two
fuckin' eyes in my head,

01:07:13.800 --> 01:07:17.918
yeah, I think you should get
divorced as soon as possible.

01:07:18.760 --> 01:07:20.512
This is some
catastrophic shit.

01:07:44.120 --> 01:07:45.633
I think it's for
the best.

01:07:46.400 --> 01:07:47.594
Yeah. Me too.

01:07:51.280 --> 01:07:52.429
Can I give you a hug?

01:07:56.600 --> 01:07:59.797
Mike. I'm so sorry.

01:08:02.520 --> 01:08:03.794
I'm sorry, too.

01:08:04.320 --> 01:08:05.320
Mmm.

01:08:10.280 --> 01:08:11.296
You gotta watch
out for you first.

01:08:11.320 --> 01:08:14.278
Dale, why is there a
security guard in my office?

01:08:14.440 --> 01:08:15.839
Hey, Amy, uh,
I'm so sorry,

01:08:15.920 --> 01:08:18.479
but we're gonna have to
positively transition you.

01:08:18.560 --> 01:08:20.038
Are you firing me?

01:08:20.120 --> 01:08:23.192
Yuck. Okay, that's not my word.
I don't like that word.

01:08:23.319 --> 01:08:24.319
But, yes,
I'm firing you.

01:08:24.439 --> 01:08:25.439
Why?

01:08:25.520 --> 01:08:27.272
Well, you quit
coming to the office.

01:08:27.359 --> 01:08:30.477
Okay, maybe I've been slacking
off a little bit, but...

01:08:31.399 --> 01:08:34.312
Tessa took two weeks off when Jon
Snow died on Game of Thrones,

01:08:34.399 --> 01:08:35.496
and he's not
even a real person.

01:08:35.520 --> 01:08:38.113
To be fair, we all took two
weeks off when Jon Snow died.

01:08:38.200 --> 01:08:40.319
You're the only person that
didn't take two weeks off.

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:42.194
But as a token
of appreciation

01:08:42.279 --> 01:08:43.680
for your six years
with the company,

01:08:43.720 --> 01:08:45.596
I got you
a very special gift.

01:08:48.840 --> 01:08:50.193
You got me
the four-ounce bag?

01:08:50.279 --> 01:08:51.952
Couldn't even
splurge for the eight?

01:09:03.399 --> 01:09:04.399
What?

01:09:04.520 --> 01:09:07.318
Ms. Mitchell, this is
Principal Burr. We need you to come in.

01:09:07.399 --> 01:09:09.310
Okay, okay.
I'll be right there,

01:09:09.399 --> 01:09:12.153
and I'm very sorry, Principal,
for how I answered the phone.

01:09:15.359 --> 01:09:16.997
I'm sorry.
You found what?

01:09:17.080 --> 01:09:20.277
I found marijuana cigarettes
in your daughter's locker.

01:09:20.359 --> 01:09:22.999
Now, it looks like Sour Diesel
or a little Afghan Kush.

01:09:23.080 --> 01:09:25.229
That's impossible.
She's only 12.

01:09:25.359 --> 01:09:28.033
It happens. Snoop been
smokin' since he was five.

01:09:28.160 --> 01:09:29.309
Those aren't mine.

01:09:29.399 --> 01:09:31.310
I mean, Mom, I swear to God,
they're not mine.

01:09:31.399 --> 01:09:32.627
Baby, I believe you.

01:09:32.720 --> 01:09:34.711
And why were you looking
in my locker anyway?

01:09:34.840 --> 01:09:37.991
We were tipped off
by a concerned parent.

01:09:38.600 --> 01:09:40.318
Wait a minute.

01:09:40.399 --> 01:09:42.834
Was this concerned parent's
name Gwendolyn James?

01:09:42.920 --> 01:09:45.216
Hey, listen, I don't know nothin'
about Gwendolyn James, all right?

01:09:45.240 --> 01:09:46.274
That woman scares me.

01:09:46.359 --> 01:09:49.830
What I do know is this school
is a zero-tolerance school,

01:09:49.920 --> 01:09:51.216
so that means that
your daughter's banned

01:09:51.240 --> 01:09:52.877
from all extra-curricular
activities.

01:09:53.160 --> 01:09:54.160
What does that mean?

01:09:54.240 --> 01:09:55.753
That means you're
off the soccer team.

01:09:55.920 --> 01:09:57.114
What?

01:09:58.200 --> 01:10:00.270
Oh, my God.
Hey, my hands were tied.

01:10:01.840 --> 01:10:03.068
Honey, baby, hold on.

01:10:04.600 --> 01:10:06.955
That little girl
rolls a real tight jay.

01:10:08.200 --> 01:10:09.679
This is all your fault.

01:10:09.760 --> 01:10:11.432
Why did you mess
with Gwendolyn James?

01:10:11.560 --> 01:10:13.312
Sweetie,
I am so sorry.

01:10:13.560 --> 01:10:15.278
Honey, please,
I didn't mean for this.

01:10:15.440 --> 01:10:17.192
Yes, you did
mean to, Mom!

01:10:17.600 --> 01:10:20.353
You were sick of
being a mom, so you quit

01:10:20.440 --> 01:10:21.793
and you started partying

01:10:21.880 --> 01:10:23.836
with your weird,
new friends,

01:10:23.920 --> 01:10:26.036
and blowing off work,
and, oh, yeah,

01:10:26.120 --> 01:10:29.237
having sex with
Lori Harkness' dad.

01:10:29.600 --> 01:10:30.749
So gross!

01:10:31.160 --> 01:10:32.957
Honey, I know
that you're mad.

01:10:33.080 --> 01:10:35.355
I get it.
You are so selfish, Mom.

01:10:35.440 --> 01:10:38.591
You are so selfish and
it frigging sucks, okay?

01:10:38.720 --> 01:10:41.678
Baby, I'm so sorry. Tell me,
how can I make this better?

01:10:41.760 --> 01:10:43.910
No. I wanna stay
with Dad tonight.

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:45.479
Even he's a better
parent than you.

01:10:54.400 --> 01:10:55.515
Oh, my God.

01:10:56.400 --> 01:10:59.039
Guys! Guys, guys.
Did you hear?

01:10:59.120 --> 01:11:02.192
Amy Mitchell's daughter
got busted for drugs.

01:11:02.320 --> 01:11:03.958
What? No way!
Yeah.

01:11:04.480 --> 01:11:07.233
Look, I am not blaming Amy Mitchell.
I mean, my God, I would never...

01:11:07.320 --> 01:11:09.675
Of course... ever
judge another mother,

01:11:09.800 --> 01:11:12.075
but I think we really
have to ask ourselves,

01:11:12.160 --> 01:11:16.551
do we want someone who is that
reckless and irresponsible

01:11:16.640 --> 01:11:21.316
and mentally unhinged alcoholic
to be president of the PTA?

01:11:22.360 --> 01:11:23.395
I don't know.

01:11:23.480 --> 01:11:26.836
You know what? I never even liked her.
She looks foreign.

01:11:26.960 --> 01:11:28.678
Oh, God.
Foreigners.

01:11:28.760 --> 01:11:30.796
Listen. I think now
we just need to pray

01:11:30.880 --> 01:11:34.077
that Amy's little crackhead
daughter gets the help she needs.

01:11:39.040 --> 01:11:40.473
Mike, if Janey
needs anything,

01:11:40.560 --> 01:11:42.755
and I mean anything,
just please call me.

01:11:42.840 --> 01:11:45.115
Babe, it's gonna be fine.
I'm staying at the Waldorf.

01:11:45.200 --> 01:11:47.839
They got an indoor-outdoor
pool, room service,

01:11:47.920 --> 01:11:49.016
18-hole golf course.
It's killer.

01:11:49.040 --> 01:11:50.871
You're staying
at the Waldorf?

01:11:50.960 --> 01:11:53.713
God, this is a divorce,
not a luxury vacation, Mike.

01:11:53.800 --> 01:11:55.313
It's a safe hotel.

01:11:55.400 --> 01:11:58.358
Wait, bye, angel!
Have so much fun with Daddy!

01:11:59.360 --> 01:12:00.839
Can I get a hug?

01:12:02.280 --> 01:12:04.953
No? Okay. Okay.

01:12:06.560 --> 01:12:08.915
Oh, no, buddy, wait.
You're also going?

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:11.309
Dylan, you know
the hotel has TVs.

01:12:11.400 --> 01:12:13.197
You don't have
to bring your own.

01:12:15.560 --> 01:12:18.632
Oh, Roscoe,
not you, too.

01:12:18.720 --> 01:12:21.234
Oh, the Waldorf's dog-friendly,
so don't worry.

01:12:21.360 --> 01:12:22.679
Yeah. So.

01:12:22.760 --> 01:12:24.398
Mike, please go.
Yeah.

01:12:29.160 --> 01:12:30.354
Bye, kids.

01:14:05.480 --> 01:14:08.358
Welcome to
the annual PTA election.

01:14:13.320 --> 01:14:15.914
We will start with
the candidates' statements,

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:18.468
and since only one
bothered to show up,

01:14:19.160 --> 01:14:20.479
she will go first.

01:14:21.800 --> 01:14:23.313
Gwendolyn,
you have five minutes.

01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:28.150
Thank you.
I'll talk as long as I want.

01:14:35.520 --> 01:14:37.795
God, this movie's
depressing.

01:14:38.320 --> 01:14:39.594
Amy!
Amy, I'm sorry we're late.

01:14:39.680 --> 01:14:40.999
Oh, my God!
It's Kiki's fault.

01:14:41.160 --> 01:14:42.176
Sorry we're late, honey.
So sorry.

01:14:42.200 --> 01:14:43.235
I had to pee.

01:14:43.360 --> 01:14:44.536
What's happening?
Why aren't you ready?

01:14:44.560 --> 01:14:45.629
What's going on?

01:14:45.720 --> 01:14:47.039
What are you talking about?

01:14:47.400 --> 01:14:49.231
What are you...
It's the PTA election.

01:14:49.360 --> 01:14:52.193
Oh, my God, no. Sorry,
I'm not going to that.

01:14:52.320 --> 01:14:53.719
What? Why not?

01:14:53.880 --> 01:14:55.438
Oh, I don't know.

01:14:55.520 --> 01:14:59.274
Maybe because my husband
left me, my kids left me.

01:14:59.360 --> 01:15:01.191
My fucking dog left me.

01:15:01.320 --> 01:15:03.436
All the moms
in school hate me,

01:15:03.560 --> 01:15:07.838
and I am a complete and
utter failure as a mother.

01:15:07.920 --> 01:15:10.115
First of all, you are so
not a failure as a mother.

01:15:10.200 --> 01:15:12.953
In fact, you're the best
mother that we've ever seen.

01:15:13.040 --> 01:15:14.040
True that.

01:15:14.160 --> 01:15:16.116
You give your
kids salad.

01:15:16.240 --> 01:15:18.231
You remember your
kids' birthdays.

01:15:18.720 --> 01:15:20.915
I mean, I sat here
and watched you wait

01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:23.594
until your kid fell
asleep before you got high.

01:15:23.680 --> 01:15:26.240
Most moms do that, Carla.

01:15:26.840 --> 01:15:27.989
That's most moms, yeah.

01:15:28.080 --> 01:15:31.709
Well, whatever. This is the worst
thing I've ever seen you do.

01:15:31.880 --> 01:15:32.949
You've quit trying.

01:15:33.920 --> 01:15:35.558
We don't quit!
Moms don't quit!

01:15:35.680 --> 01:15:37.989
No! Quitting
is for dads!

01:15:38.080 --> 01:15:39.080
Uh...

01:15:39.760 --> 01:15:42.069
Listen, no matter what
shit is thrown at us,

01:15:42.160 --> 01:15:43.229
us moms, we have
to just...

01:15:44.280 --> 01:15:45.759
We have to just keep going.
Mmm-hmm.

01:15:45.960 --> 01:15:47.359
And do you know why?

01:15:47.480 --> 01:15:49.232
Because we have
low self-esteem.

01:15:49.360 --> 01:15:51.157
No. No, no.

01:15:51.920 --> 01:15:54.036
It's because
we love our kids.

01:15:54.120 --> 01:15:55.360
It's because we
love our stupid,

01:15:55.440 --> 01:15:57.829
selfish, ungrateful,
little shit-faces!

01:15:57.920 --> 01:15:58.920
That's why.

01:15:58.960 --> 01:16:01.679
We love 'em so much
that we would do...

01:16:02.440 --> 01:16:03.873
Literally anything
for them.

01:16:04.600 --> 01:16:06.397
You guys,
I can't win the election.

01:16:06.480 --> 01:16:07.480
Oh, my God!
Amy!

01:16:07.560 --> 01:16:09.152
Amy! This is not
about the election.

01:16:09.240 --> 01:16:10.240
Amy, sit up.

01:16:10.320 --> 01:16:11.992
This is about
standing up to the bitch

01:16:12.080 --> 01:16:13.798
that hurt your
little girl!

01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:18.073
Now, are you gonna sit here and let
Gwendolyn get away with this shit?

01:16:18.160 --> 01:16:19.912
Don't do it, Amy.
Fuck that!

01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:21.228
Fuck it!

01:16:21.680 --> 01:16:25.878
You are gonna rise up like a
small, little white Apollo Creed

01:16:26.560 --> 01:16:28.841
and you are gonna look at
Gwendolyn and you are gonna say,

01:16:28.960 --> 01:16:30.576
"You can do what you want to me,
I don't care,

01:16:30.600 --> 01:16:31.635
"throw it at me,

01:16:31.760 --> 01:16:33.990
"but you fucked
with my daughter,

01:16:34.120 --> 01:16:35.519
"and now I have to
fight you.

01:16:36.640 --> 01:16:38.631
"I will fight you
in the playground.

01:16:38.800 --> 01:16:40.791
"I will fight you
in the cafeteria.

01:16:41.800 --> 01:16:45.475
"I will even fight you in the
parking lot of Trader Joe's.

01:16:46.840 --> 01:16:49.479
"But I will have justice
for my little girl,

01:16:50.640 --> 01:16:53.552
"because I am
a fucking mom.

01:16:55.120 --> 01:16:58.157
"And we protect
our young."

01:17:00.720 --> 01:17:02.915
So get up off
this couch,

01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:05.958
turn off
12 Years a Slave

01:17:06.040 --> 01:17:08.031
and let's
body slam this bitch.

01:17:11.560 --> 01:17:13.596
Come on, Amy.
Come on,

01:17:13.680 --> 01:17:14.954
get those tits up.

01:17:15.040 --> 01:17:16.678
Get 'em up.
Get 'em up.

01:17:16.760 --> 01:17:18.557
Get your boobs up.
Get those tits right up.

01:17:18.680 --> 01:17:20.750
I'm gonna get my tits up.
Get your tits up!

01:17:20.880 --> 01:17:22.536
They're getting up, you guys.
They're getting up.

01:17:22.560 --> 01:17:24.176
I can see it.
Guys, my tits are gettin' up.

01:17:24.200 --> 01:17:26.270
They're getting up.
They're getting up. That's it.

01:17:26.360 --> 01:17:27.793
They are up!

01:17:37.520 --> 01:17:39.033
Go, go, go, go!

01:17:45.080 --> 01:17:46.080
Oh, my God.

01:17:46.160 --> 01:17:48.754
I can't seem to locate
my safety belt back here.

01:17:54.840 --> 01:17:56.512
This is a one-way street!

01:17:58.360 --> 01:17:59.475
Move out of the way!

01:17:59.560 --> 01:18:02.677
We're on our way to a PTA meeting,
motherfuckers!

01:18:02.880 --> 01:18:04.108
Oh, my God,
there's a truck!

01:18:04.400 --> 01:18:06.311
Truck! Truck! Truck!
Oh, my God!

01:18:11.080 --> 01:18:12.354
Oh, my God.

01:18:13.800 --> 01:18:16.394
Oh, shit. Oh, fun.
Kent is calling.

01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:18.228
- Hi, honey.
- Kiki.

01:18:18.920 --> 01:18:20.638
The kids are going insane.

01:18:20.720 --> 01:18:22.870
I can't do this.
You gotta come home right now.

01:18:23.400 --> 01:18:25.152
But I can't come home.

01:18:25.240 --> 01:18:27.959
I'm going to the PTA
meeting with my friends.

01:18:28.040 --> 01:18:30.235
No, no, no, no.
I said come home now, damn it!

01:18:33.680 --> 01:18:34.829
And I said,

01:18:34.920 --> 01:18:38.833
"I'm going to the fucking PTA
meeting with my fucking friends,"

01:18:38.920 --> 01:18:41.878
so stop being such a goddamn
pussy and make it work!

01:18:42.560 --> 01:18:43.879
Kiki. Kiki...

01:18:48.400 --> 01:18:49.674
That was very exciting.

01:18:49.760 --> 01:18:51.576
How good did that feel?
That felt good, didn't it?

01:18:51.600 --> 01:18:53.431
It's very exciting!
Yes!

01:18:53.560 --> 01:18:55.551
It's very exciting!

01:18:57.360 --> 01:19:00.193
And it is for that reason
and the 47 others

01:19:00.280 --> 01:19:02.157
that I laid out
for you today

01:19:02.240 --> 01:19:04.754
that I humbly
ask for your vote.

01:19:09.440 --> 01:19:11.271
All right,
thank you, Gwendolyn.

01:19:12.280 --> 01:19:14.635
Uh, well...
Sorry I'm late!

01:19:17.080 --> 01:19:20.072
Actually, you're just in time to
give your candidate statement.

01:19:20.160 --> 01:19:21.354
What's a candidate
statement?

01:19:21.480 --> 01:19:22.799
Oh, I think
that's like a speech.

01:19:22.840 --> 01:19:25.096
You got one of those, right, honey?
What are you talking about?

01:19:25.120 --> 01:19:27.395
- You don't have a speech?
- Of course not!

01:19:27.480 --> 01:19:28.629
It's all good.

01:19:29.800 --> 01:19:31.028
She's got
a great speech.

01:19:31.400 --> 01:19:33.436
I'm not good at
this public speaking.

01:19:34.800 --> 01:19:37.473
Hey, we're sitting here.
Move, move, sorry, move.

01:19:42.840 --> 01:19:43.840
Okay.

01:19:47.200 --> 01:19:49.316
Wow, there's a lot of you.

01:19:49.400 --> 01:19:50.753
Introduce yourself.

01:19:51.680 --> 01:19:54.433
Hi, I'm Amy Mitchell.

01:19:54.560 --> 01:19:56.278
Good.

01:19:56.360 --> 01:19:57.873
And I'm running
for PTA president.

01:20:01.160 --> 01:20:02.195
You're doing great.

01:20:03.160 --> 01:20:04.336
Just 'cause
they're not responding

01:20:04.360 --> 01:20:05.998
doesn't mean they think
you're terrible.

01:20:10.440 --> 01:20:11.793
You know...

01:20:13.520 --> 01:20:16.080
I know there's a lot of rumors
going around about my daughter.

01:20:17.680 --> 01:20:18.908
That's a bad place
to start.

01:20:19.040 --> 01:20:21.759
And I'm guessing a lot of you
think that I'm a bad mom.

01:20:21.840 --> 01:20:22.875
Yes.

01:20:22.960 --> 01:20:26.077
No, no. No, you know what?
You're right.

01:20:26.600 --> 01:20:29.273
Sometimes,
I'm too lenient with my kids.

01:20:29.360 --> 01:20:31.191
Sometimes,
I'm too strict.

01:20:31.280 --> 01:20:32.952
Well, we overestimated her,
obviously.

01:20:33.040 --> 01:20:34.234
Sometimes, I'm so crazy

01:20:34.320 --> 01:20:35.696
that I don't even
understand the words

01:20:35.720 --> 01:20:37.199
that are coming
out of my mouth.

01:20:38.920 --> 01:20:42.879
You see, what works for my daughter
almost never works for my son.

01:20:44.880 --> 01:20:48.316
And whenever I think I'm actually
starting to figure my kids out,

01:20:49.440 --> 01:20:52.273
they grow up
and I'm back to square one.

01:20:53.480 --> 01:20:56.677
So, the truth is,
when it comes to being a mom,

01:20:58.640 --> 01:21:00.756
I have no fucking
clue what I'm doing.

01:21:02.760 --> 01:21:05.558
And you know what?
I don't think anyone does.

01:21:05.680 --> 01:21:08.319
I think we're all bad moms,
and you know why?

01:21:08.880 --> 01:21:13.874
Because being a mom
today is impossible!

01:21:17.600 --> 01:21:19.636
I never doubted her.
I never doubted her.

01:21:19.720 --> 01:21:21.836
She's doing great.
She's a natural.

01:21:21.920 --> 01:21:25.913
So can we all just please stop
pretending like we have it figured out

01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:28.036
and stop judging
each other for once?

01:21:29.080 --> 01:21:31.719
Look, I'm running
for PTA president because...

01:21:31.800 --> 01:21:34.598
Because I want our
school to be a place

01:21:34.680 --> 01:21:37.194
where you can make mistakes,
where you can be yourself,

01:21:37.280 --> 01:21:39.430
where you're being judged
on how hard you work

01:21:39.520 --> 01:21:42.159
and not on what you bring
to the fucking bake sale.

01:21:46.360 --> 01:21:47.509
Yeah!
Yeah!

01:21:47.600 --> 01:21:51.195
I want our school to be a place
where it's okay to be a bad mom.

01:21:51.280 --> 01:21:52.713
Do you know
what I mean?

01:21:53.320 --> 01:21:55.959
My kids haven't had
a bath in three weeks.

01:21:56.560 --> 01:21:58.869
That's okay! Listen,
we've all been there.

01:21:58.960 --> 01:22:03.670
I confiscated my son's weed and
then I smoked the shit out of it!

01:22:05.080 --> 01:22:06.672
What's your number?

01:22:06.760 --> 01:22:09.433
I give my kids a Benadryl
every Tuesday night

01:22:09.520 --> 01:22:10.873
so I can watch The Voice.

01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:15.036
I can't tell
my twins apart!

01:22:15.120 --> 01:22:17.236
I let my 7-year-old
watch Mad Max.

01:22:17.320 --> 01:22:19.197
I drink margaritas
for breakfast.

01:22:19.280 --> 01:22:21.475
I threw my son's
violin in the garbage.

01:22:25.040 --> 01:22:27.156
Oh, honey,
we don't speak Spanish.

01:22:27.240 --> 01:22:29.879
I like my nanny better
than I like my husband.

01:22:29.960 --> 01:22:31.360
Wait, really?

01:22:33.400 --> 01:22:34.958
Yeah, you do!

01:22:35.240 --> 01:22:36.434
I don't even have kids!

01:22:36.520 --> 01:22:38.988
I just come to PTA meetings
because I'm lonely.

01:22:39.160 --> 01:22:40.593
Aw.

01:22:42.840 --> 01:22:43.840
Here's the thing.

01:22:44.320 --> 01:22:45.719
If you're a perfect mom

01:22:45.800 --> 01:22:48.394
who's got this whole
parenting thing figured out,

01:22:48.480 --> 01:22:51.153
well, then, you should
probably vote for Gwendolyn,

01:22:51.320 --> 01:22:53.356
'cause she's amazing.

01:22:53.520 --> 01:22:54.520
Yes.

01:22:54.680 --> 01:22:56.750
But if you're
a bad mom like me

01:22:56.840 --> 01:22:58.990
and you have no fucking clue
what you're doing,

01:22:59.800 --> 01:23:02.712
or you're just sick of being
judged all the time...

01:23:04.880 --> 01:23:06.518
Then please vote for me.

01:23:07.800 --> 01:23:09.320
Thank you.

01:23:11.560 --> 01:23:12.959
Oh, my God!

01:23:16.920 --> 01:23:18.319
Are you kidding me?

01:23:34.360 --> 01:23:35.475
Yes!

01:23:35.560 --> 01:23:36.720
Amy! Amy! Amy!

01:23:36.760 --> 01:23:39.513
Look at that!
This is your PTA president!

01:23:46.480 --> 01:23:48.869
Amy! Amy! Amy!

01:23:49.360 --> 01:23:50.634
Oh, mama.

01:23:50.720 --> 01:23:52.711
I feel invigorated.
This is so great!

01:23:52.840 --> 01:23:55.559
I still can't believe you won.
I know!

01:23:55.640 --> 01:23:58.029
Oh, I'm so happy you guys
dragged me out of the house.

01:23:58.640 --> 01:24:00.949
Oh, sweetheart, I didn't
doubt you for a second.

01:24:01.120 --> 01:24:03.634
Oh, God, you know,
I forgot what it was

01:24:03.720 --> 01:24:04.835
like to have real friends,

01:24:04.920 --> 01:24:07.275
like, true friends.

01:24:07.360 --> 01:24:08.360
I know.

01:24:08.400 --> 01:24:11.676
Before you guys, my only friend
was that lady on Google Maps.

01:24:13.520 --> 01:24:15.112
You're pretty much
the first bitches

01:24:15.200 --> 01:24:17.270
to ever talk to me
at this school, so...

01:24:17.400 --> 01:24:20.278
I'm so happy we found
each other, you guys.

01:24:20.360 --> 01:24:21.918
Me too.
Me three.

01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:24.036
Let's hug for
a really long time.

01:24:24.160 --> 01:24:26.549
Come on, bring it in.
Bring it in.

01:24:31.800 --> 01:24:34.189
Hey, will you guys
give me, like, a second?

01:24:35.440 --> 01:24:37.237
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Yeah, honey. Sure.

01:24:37.320 --> 01:24:38.514
Okay.
Sure, take a minute.

01:24:38.600 --> 01:24:39.874
Digest it.
Thanks.

01:24:54.800 --> 01:24:56.320
What, did you come
to gloat?

01:24:56.360 --> 01:24:58.635
No. No, no, I'm just
seeing if you're okay.

01:24:58.760 --> 01:25:01.593
I'm fine. Everything's fine.
I'm fine.

01:25:01.720 --> 01:25:04.553
Okay. I don't wanna bother you.
No, I'm good.

01:25:04.640 --> 01:25:06.471
It's just that the PTA

01:25:07.560 --> 01:25:10.632
was the only good thing in my
life and now I've lost that, too.

01:25:11.240 --> 01:25:13.515
Come on, Gwendolyn,
your life is awesome.

01:25:14.120 --> 01:25:16.475
You have, like,
three boats.

01:25:16.560 --> 01:25:18.994
I have four boats.
Okay.

01:25:19.560 --> 01:25:24.236
But, no...
My life is so not awesome.

01:25:25.240 --> 01:25:27.231
Gwendolyn, what could
possibly be wrong?

01:25:27.320 --> 01:25:28.320
Oh, God.

01:25:29.200 --> 01:25:30.679
Okay, well,

01:25:31.520 --> 01:25:33.238
for starters...

01:25:33.320 --> 01:25:36.073
My husband was just arrested
for embezzling

01:25:36.160 --> 01:25:38.469
$100 million from
a children's charity.

01:25:39.680 --> 01:25:41.910
And I have night terrors.

01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:46.039
And I have to take Vicodin every 20
minutes, and I'm not even in any pain.

01:25:46.480 --> 01:25:48.516
I'm just addicted
to them now.

01:25:48.600 --> 01:25:49.816
I'm pretty sure
my brother-in-law

01:25:49.840 --> 01:25:52.229
just joined ISIS,
and he's a Jew!

01:25:52.960 --> 01:25:56.873
Oh, and also, my DVR just
stopped recording Castle.

01:25:56.960 --> 01:25:58.234
Just out of nowhere.

01:25:58.320 --> 01:26:01.198
Like, how the fuck
does that even happen?

01:26:01.280 --> 01:26:03.840
And I am the only thing
holding my family together,

01:26:03.920 --> 01:26:07.629
so, yeah, it's awesome.

01:26:08.720 --> 01:26:10.039
It's just awesome.

01:26:10.360 --> 01:26:11.360
Wow.

01:26:11.440 --> 01:26:14.398
I had no idea.
Yeah.

01:26:15.440 --> 01:26:18.238
You just always acted like
everything was so perfect.

01:26:24.080 --> 01:26:25.274
Hey,

01:26:25.360 --> 01:26:27.954
I'm really sorry about
what I did to your daughter.

01:26:28.640 --> 01:26:31.837
I promise you I will get her back
on the soccer team, all right?

01:26:34.440 --> 01:26:37.398
I know that was
a really shitty thing to do.

01:26:38.200 --> 01:26:39.872
Yeah.
Even for me.

01:26:40.440 --> 01:26:42.670
Listen, we're all
bad moms, right?

01:26:42.800 --> 01:26:43.869
Yeah.

01:26:44.880 --> 01:26:46.840
That was literally the only
thing you said tonight

01:26:46.880 --> 01:26:48.199
that made
any fuckin' sense.

01:26:51.160 --> 01:26:52.160
Bye.

01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:12.355
Hey, guys. Can I talk
to you for a second?

01:27:12.440 --> 01:27:13.555
Yeah.

01:27:16.360 --> 01:27:17.360
Look, I just wanna say

01:27:17.440 --> 01:27:19.476
I'm really sorry for how
I've been acting lately.

01:27:19.600 --> 01:27:22.239
Oh, it's fine. Yeah, it's just
menopause, right?

01:27:22.360 --> 01:27:24.476
No.
It's not menopause.

01:27:24.560 --> 01:27:26.630
And I'm sorry
for acting so crazy

01:27:26.760 --> 01:27:27.880
about the whole
soccer thing.

01:27:28.560 --> 01:27:30.630
I'm really trying
to chill out more.

01:27:30.720 --> 01:27:32.836
I mean, it's just
soccer. Right?

01:27:33.480 --> 01:27:35.038
I got you back on
the soccer team.

01:27:35.120 --> 01:27:36.838
Shut up!
Shut up.

01:27:36.920 --> 01:27:39.036
Shut your face!
Oh, my God.

01:27:39.120 --> 01:27:40.519
Thank you so much, Mom.

01:27:41.440 --> 01:27:42.919
Oh, I love you.
Get in here.

01:27:43.520 --> 01:27:45.829
There. Oh, I love you guys
so much.

01:27:45.920 --> 01:27:47.478
You're amazing kids.

01:27:48.240 --> 01:27:51.277
I promise, I promise
to always be here for you.

01:27:52.200 --> 01:27:53.200
Oh.

01:27:53.640 --> 01:27:54.914
My babies.

01:27:55.040 --> 01:27:56.040
Oh...

01:27:56.120 --> 01:27:57.633
I almost forgot!
Where is he going?

01:27:58.440 --> 01:27:59.634
Why is he
touching the oven?

01:28:02.640 --> 01:28:04.198
I made a frittata.

01:28:04.840 --> 01:28:08.389
Did you just say "frittata"?

01:28:08.480 --> 01:28:10.056
You said you weren't gonna
cook for us anymore,

01:28:10.080 --> 01:28:11.798
so I taught
myself how to cook.

01:28:12.800 --> 01:28:16.270
Oh, honey, I'm so proud of you!
Get in here. I love you.

01:28:16.360 --> 01:28:18.157
I love you. Okay, okay,
all right, all right.

01:28:18.240 --> 01:28:19.639
Okay, okay, okay,
okay, okay, okay.

01:28:19.720 --> 01:28:20.720
All right, okay, let go.

01:28:20.840 --> 01:28:22.592
Okay. I gotta go
do my homework.

01:28:24.360 --> 01:28:25.588
Who are you?

01:28:28.920 --> 01:28:30.672
I said, "You're holding back"

01:28:30.760 --> 01:28:33.354
She said,
"Shut up and dance with me!"

01:28:33.440 --> 01:28:36.000
This woman is my destiny

01:28:36.200 --> 01:28:40.876
She said, "Ooh-ooh-hoo,
Shut up and dance with me!"

01:28:43.480 --> 01:28:45.948
Oh, hold on. Sorry, guys.
One sec, one sec.

01:28:46.840 --> 01:28:48.432
Hello, this is Amy.

01:28:48.520 --> 01:28:49.635
Hey, Amy, it's Dale.

01:28:50.160 --> 01:28:52.880
The company is falling apart without you.
Could you please come back?

01:28:52.960 --> 01:28:54.757
I will give you
whatever you want.

01:28:55.240 --> 01:28:56.912
Whatever?
Whatever I want?

01:28:57.000 --> 01:28:58.399
Yes! Yes! Anything.

01:28:58.920 --> 01:29:03.072
Okay, um, well,
I wanna double my pay.

01:29:03.760 --> 01:29:07.594
I wanna work from
home two days a week.

01:29:07.880 --> 01:29:12.317
Oh, and I wanna hire three
women over the age of 12

01:29:12.400 --> 01:29:13.753
to fill out my team.

01:29:13.840 --> 01:29:16.195
Okay, okay, fine. Anything you want.
Can you start today?

01:29:16.280 --> 01:29:18.157
Oh, no, no. No, sorry,
today's not good for me.

01:29:18.240 --> 01:29:20.549
I'll start sometime next week.
Thanks. Bye-bye.

01:29:33.960 --> 01:29:35.029
Come here.
Love you.

01:29:35.760 --> 01:29:37.056
Great day at school.
Love you, Mom.

01:29:37.080 --> 01:29:39.389
I love you kiddos.
Be great, okay?

01:29:39.480 --> 01:29:40.913
Okay.
Be amazing. Be awesome.

01:29:41.840 --> 01:29:42.909
Love you!

01:29:48.200 --> 01:29:49.599
When did they
get so big?

01:29:50.720 --> 01:29:51.835
I don't know.

01:29:54.520 --> 01:29:56.988
Hey, what would happen
if I came over Friday night,

01:29:57.120 --> 01:29:58.320
brought a great
bottle of wine,

01:29:58.400 --> 01:29:59.680
you know,
made you a nice dinner,

01:29:59.760 --> 01:30:02.160
maybe ran you a hot bath and
someone just took care of you...

01:30:02.240 --> 01:30:04.310
I love you.
...for a change?

01:30:04.400 --> 01:30:05.958
What did you just say?
What?

01:30:06.040 --> 01:30:07.519
What was that?
I said nothing.

01:30:07.600 --> 01:30:09.909
You said nothing.
I meant to say that I...

01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:12.195
God, I would love that.
I would love that.

01:30:12.480 --> 01:30:13.833
Great.
Yeah.

01:30:15.320 --> 01:30:16.912
I'll see you Friday.
Okay.

01:30:24.320 --> 01:30:26.880
I'll see you after school.
Be good, okay?

01:30:28.720 --> 01:30:29.869
Hey, how's it going?

01:30:29.960 --> 01:30:31.916
I'm doing amazing.

01:30:32.760 --> 01:30:36.435
I slept in late, skipped my workout,
had, like, four donuts.

01:30:36.520 --> 01:30:37.635
I told these kids,

01:30:37.720 --> 01:30:39.711
"Look, you get yourself
ready for school today."

01:30:39.800 --> 01:30:42.598
And my husband totally
Fifty-Shaded me this morning.

01:30:42.960 --> 01:30:44.871
Oh.
I've never felt better.

01:30:45.080 --> 01:30:46.080
Wow.

01:30:46.160 --> 01:30:47.309
Yeah.

01:30:55.160 --> 01:30:56.160
Hi!

01:30:57.280 --> 01:30:58.998
Did you remember
Maddie's backpack?

01:31:01.160 --> 01:31:03.628
Shoot. No, I left it
in the car.

01:31:03.720 --> 01:31:05.631
Okay, well, let's go get it, dude.
Right?

01:31:05.720 --> 01:31:06.720
Chop-chop.

01:31:06.800 --> 01:31:08.438
I'm so sorry.
Be right back.

01:31:08.520 --> 01:31:09.839
It's not gonna
grab itself.

01:31:14.720 --> 01:31:15.835
Hey, Jackson.

01:31:17.200 --> 01:31:18.599
I, uh...

01:31:18.680 --> 01:31:20.716
I made you lunch today.

01:31:20.800 --> 01:31:22.836
It's a hummus
wrap with some kale.

01:31:23.080 --> 01:31:24.080
Gross!

01:31:24.160 --> 01:31:25.496
Yeah, I know, it sounds
totally disgusting,

01:31:25.520 --> 01:31:28.398
but it's supposed to
be good for you, so...

01:31:28.480 --> 01:31:30.096
And I'm gonna come to your
baseball game tomorrow night.

01:31:30.120 --> 01:31:33.271
For real? I'm gonna stay
the whole stupid game.

01:31:33.520 --> 01:31:34.520
Mmm-hmm.

01:31:34.920 --> 01:31:36.148
Because...

01:31:38.320 --> 01:31:39.514
I love you.

01:31:40.760 --> 01:31:41.875
And stuff.

01:31:44.120 --> 01:31:45.120
Oh.

01:31:59.560 --> 01:32:02.154
Still cannot believe I pushed
that thing outta my chotch.

01:32:02.760 --> 01:32:05.558
Hey. What's up,
pretty ladies?

01:32:05.640 --> 01:32:06.834
What should we
do today?

01:32:06.920 --> 01:32:08.353
How about we
go to brunch?

01:32:08.480 --> 01:32:09.480
Mmm.

01:32:09.560 --> 01:32:10.896
Oh, how about we go
to Color Me Mine

01:32:10.920 --> 01:32:12.319
and make each
other salad bowls?

01:32:12.400 --> 01:32:13.628
I love it.
Oh, I got an idea.

01:32:13.720 --> 01:32:15.711
Why don't we try something
that doesn't suck?

01:32:16.320 --> 01:32:18.880
Hey, bitches! Get in.

01:32:31.240 --> 01:32:32.434
Wait.

01:32:33.240 --> 01:32:36.038
Holy shit. Wait. Wait.
Wait. Is that...

01:32:36.560 --> 01:32:38.835
Well, I have my husband's
plane for the whole day,

01:32:38.920 --> 01:32:40.911
so where do you guys
wanna go, huh?

01:32:43.280 --> 01:32:45.510
You know what? Gwendolyn's
starting to grow on me, guys.

01:32:45.600 --> 01:32:48.000
I'm not gonna lie to you. I think
she's a really good person.

01:32:48.080 --> 01:32:49.559
Come on, come on!
Very generous.

01:33:05.400 --> 01:33:08.631
My role as a mother was
so hit-and-miss.

01:33:09.520 --> 01:33:12.796
I was a little looser,
but too loose in many ways.

01:33:12.880 --> 01:33:14.154
I would give her whiskey.

01:33:16.240 --> 01:33:18.754
We left the country when
she was seven years old.

01:33:18.840 --> 01:33:22.469
My mom kept telling me that
we were moving up the street.

01:33:22.800 --> 01:33:24.552
And then we flew to L.A.

01:33:24.640 --> 01:33:26.119
My mother's
a filthy liar.

01:33:26.440 --> 01:33:27.720
When I went into
labor and stuff,

01:33:27.760 --> 01:33:29.480
I didn't even ask if
it was a boy or a girl.

01:33:29.560 --> 01:33:31.198
I just asked
for Demerol.

01:33:32.680 --> 01:33:34.636
I heard someone
calling my name.

01:33:34.720 --> 01:33:36.153
"Please come to
the service desk."

01:33:36.240 --> 01:33:37.240
I thought,
"What's that?"

01:33:37.320 --> 01:33:39.280
And I looked around,
there was no Kathryn.

01:33:39.480 --> 01:33:41.391
She was three years old.
I was three years old.

01:33:41.480 --> 01:33:44.074
I'm thinking,
oh, my God, that was bad!

01:33:44.160 --> 01:33:45.832
When I was
nine years old,

01:33:46.480 --> 01:33:49.392
um, my mom took me to see
Cruising in the theaters

01:33:49.920 --> 01:33:52.275
because she loved Al Pacino.
I loved Al Pacino.

01:33:52.360 --> 01:33:54.271
Cruising is
a movie about a man

01:33:54.360 --> 01:33:57.716
investigating the
underworld of S&M gay clubs

01:33:58.080 --> 01:34:00.958
because there was a man murdering
men after raping them.

01:34:01.040 --> 01:34:02.553
Al Pacino.

01:34:02.640 --> 01:34:04.995
You do stupid
things as a parent

01:34:05.080 --> 01:34:06.576
and you're like, "Oh, they're fine,
they're fine,"

01:34:06.600 --> 01:34:07.840
and then you're
in the hospital.

01:34:07.920 --> 01:34:10.559
Yeah, of course you lie to
your kids, of course you do,

01:34:10.640 --> 01:34:12.676
and you go through their things.
You have to.

01:34:12.760 --> 01:34:14.113
You go through
my things?

01:34:14.200 --> 01:34:16.714
Sometimes you have
to make people happy,

01:34:16.800 --> 01:34:18.631
to lie a little bit.
You know?

01:34:18.760 --> 01:34:21.069
Easter Bunny.
Tooth Fairy.

01:34:21.160 --> 01:34:23.116
Food out for
Santa Claus.

01:34:23.200 --> 01:34:24.800
You had me clean
the fireplace that year.

01:34:24.840 --> 01:34:26.296
Yeah, well, that was
a good idea anyway.

01:34:26.320 --> 01:34:27.719
Like a chimney sweep.

01:34:27.840 --> 01:34:30.479
I would just be all,
you know, upset

01:34:30.600 --> 01:34:33.194
because of the way
I thought that it had to be.

01:34:33.280 --> 01:34:35.999
You know, I was so angry one
day, and I said to her,

01:34:36.080 --> 01:34:38.594
"Dominic doesn't like you,
Eric doesn't like you."

01:34:38.680 --> 01:34:40.477
You told me to fuck off.

01:34:40.560 --> 01:34:42.835
"Laura doesn't like you.
Your dad doesn't like you."

01:34:42.920 --> 01:34:44.696
You said, "Fuck you, Mom."
Or something like that.

01:34:44.720 --> 01:34:46.640
"I don't like you, and the
dog doesn't like you."

01:34:47.880 --> 01:34:49.677
Yeah, I don't know
what I was thinking.

01:34:50.400 --> 01:34:53.312
I just really didn't
have a clue about...

01:34:53.400 --> 01:34:55.470
You were perfect.

01:34:55.560 --> 01:34:56.960
Yeah, it kind of
worked out for her.

01:34:57.000 --> 01:34:59.036
It worked out perfectly.

01:34:59.120 --> 01:35:00.553
I had the best
childhood.

01:35:00.680 --> 01:35:02.352
I loved my childhood.

01:35:02.440 --> 01:35:04.112
I had a very
happy childhood.

01:35:04.200 --> 01:35:05.553
And we would
have the best days.

01:35:05.640 --> 01:35:07.896
Yeah, it was absolutely like some
of the best times of my life.

01:35:07.920 --> 01:35:09.280
You were an amazing mom.

01:35:09.360 --> 01:35:11.157
Which is fine.
I feel good.

01:35:11.240 --> 01:35:13.310
It's nuts being a mom, guys.

01:35:13.560 --> 01:35:16.233
Raising kids is
an amazing experience.

01:35:16.320 --> 01:35:20.438
I did some mistakes, but the end,
I can see it's not as bad.

01:35:21.080 --> 01:35:23.196
They survived.
In spite of us.

01:35:23.320 --> 01:35:25.231
Now, thank goodness...

01:35:25.320 --> 01:35:29.632
You know, she turned out to be
the wonderful woman that she is.

01:35:29.720 --> 01:35:31.119
I think
she's perfect.

01:35:32.120 --> 01:35:35.669
The love that you had
when that kid was born,

01:35:35.760 --> 01:35:37.796
that you didn't have...

01:35:37.960 --> 01:35:39.632
It is a miracle.

01:35:39.720 --> 01:35:42.234
It's the wife that she is
and the mother that she is,

01:35:42.320 --> 01:35:44.197
and I'm really
proud of just her.

01:35:44.960 --> 01:35:46.029
Mom.
Yeah.

01:35:46.120 --> 01:35:48.680
She's so good, like a mom.
She's so good.

01:35:48.960 --> 01:35:50.234
Yeah.
Thanks, Mommy.

01:35:50.320 --> 01:35:52.390
So I think she's the
best mom in the world,

01:35:52.480 --> 01:35:55.711
and I go, "I wish, you know,
I'd been more like that."

01:35:55.800 --> 01:35:56.800
Oh.

01:35:56.880 --> 01:35:57.995
I love you.
I love you, hon.

01:35:58.080 --> 01:35:59.115
I love you, Mommy.

01:36:02.600 --> 01:36:03.600
Aw.

01:36:03.680 --> 01:36:05.352
You said it would
be fun, Kathryn.

01:36:06.920 --> 01:36:07.955
Don't touch my makeup.

01:36:08.040 --> 01:36:09.359
See this shit?
