WEBVTT

00:03.576 --> 00:06.354
If Elway  had had any of
the receivers like a Jerry Rice,

00:06.389 --> 00:08.290
we'd have five super bowls.
We would.

00:08.324 --> 00:09.274
(Beep)

00:09.308 --> 00:10.842
Huh? Coffee.
Let's get coffee.

00:10.876 --> 00:13.412
A big double shot for you--
keep you up all day.

00:13.446 --> 00:16.448
Yay, coffee. Okay, daddy,
I'm gonna have this today

00:16.482 --> 00:19.918
and two marshmallow peeps,
and that's all, if I'm good.

00:19.952 --> 00:21.636
It's good to set goals.

00:21.671 --> 00:23.388
Hey.

00:23.406 --> 00:24.623
Morning.

00:24.657 --> 00:26.058
Has anybody seen Boyd's wooby?

00:26.092 --> 00:29.961
I have, and it'll grow.

00:31.406 --> 00:33.240
I believe she was
referring to this.

00:33.275 --> 00:36.076
Ohh. Why don't you
wean him off that dishrag?

00:36.094 --> 00:39.113
No. This is what I use
to wean him off of me.

00:39.147 --> 00:41.282
Honey, everybody
has their thing.

00:41.316 --> 00:45.085
Mandy had her pillowcase,
Eve has Mr. Buttons, and...

00:45.120 --> 00:46.387
You have
your irrational attachment

00:46.421 --> 00:49.156
to the Denver Broncos.

00:49.191 --> 00:51.826
<i>Since when do you drink coffee?</i>

00:51.860 --> 00:53.761
Since Victor Blake
said tea is for losers.

00:53.795 --> 00:57.531
Could he stop by and make me
some, since it's all gone?

00:57.566 --> 00:58.866
Honey, don't forget.

00:58.900 --> 01:01.335
We have grandparents' day
at Boyd's school at noon.

01:01.369 --> 01:03.587
Oh, gosh.
I can't do that today.

01:03.622 --> 01:04.738
Why not?

01:04.772 --> 01:06.139
Well, at work we've got

01:06.158 --> 01:09.376
a new Chipmunk Oscillator coming
in, with a new Canuter Valve--

01:09.410 --> 01:10.494
no, no, no.

01:10.529 --> 01:12.212
You don't have to lie.

01:12.230 --> 01:14.711
If you don't want to go,
just say you don't want to go.

01:14.996 --> 01:16.263
I don't want to go.

01:16.298 --> 01:17.982
You're going.

01:18.016 --> 01:19.800
This is stupid.

01:19.834 --> 01:22.753
Dad! We don't use
the "s" word around Boyd.

01:22.804 --> 01:26.490
That's not the "s" word.
The "s" word is "socialism."

01:26.524 --> 01:28.375
Honey, it's important
to Boyd that we go.

01:28.410 --> 01:29.877
He's 2. He's not gonna
know we're there.

01:29.911 --> 01:32.563
<i>He's not gonna know
he's there. No offense.</i>

01:32.597 --> 01:36.917
See you at noon,
and don't wear that.

01:37.985 --> 01:40.454
Guys, don't waste coffee.
Come on.

01:40.488 --> 01:42.422
- (Mandy and Eve) Bye, daddy.
- This stuff doesn't grow on trees.

01:42.440 --> 01:46.627
Well, actually,
it does grow on trees.

01:46.728 --> 01:48.728
Last Man Standing - S01E03
Grandparents Day

01:51.566 --> 01:53.367
(Indistinct conversations)

01:53.401 --> 01:54.952
No.

01:55.003 --> 01:59.072
Oh, Mike, Mike, Mike, Mike,
for Kristin and Boyd, come on.

01:59.090 --> 02:02.343
Aw, look at all those grandmas.
Come on. They're adorable.

02:02.377 --> 02:05.546
Yeah, until they drive
through a farmers' market.

02:05.580 --> 02:08.848
I'm gonna check out
the snack bar.

02:10.418 --> 02:12.553
You look familiar.

02:12.587 --> 02:14.855
Do you do chair yoga at the Y?

02:14.889 --> 02:17.124
Oh, no, I'm sorry.
I don't even know what that is.

02:17.158 --> 02:18.892
Ooh. Back pillow store.

02:18.927 --> 02:20.461
Oh, there's
a back pillow store.

02:20.495 --> 02:21.729
Well, sure.

02:21.763 --> 02:24.615
Old broads like us
can't sit for long periods

02:24.649 --> 02:26.116
without our back pillows.

02:26.151 --> 02:29.653
Old--old broads like--like us?
Mm-hmm.

02:30.739 --> 02:34.992
Hey. I have
those same pants.

02:35.043 --> 02:36.076
Aah.

02:36.110 --> 02:37.611
I never thought I'd see the day

02:37.629 --> 02:40.681
when I'd be wearing pants
with an elastic waist, but...

02:40.715 --> 02:45.469
Well, when you get to be
our age, who cares?

02:45.503 --> 02:47.921
I care.

02:47.956 --> 02:50.858
What the heck is a Kelp Newton?

02:50.892 --> 02:52.893
Healthy crap is what it is.

02:52.927 --> 02:54.762
How about this?

02:54.796 --> 02:58.599
"Milk made from soy beans."
How do you get milk from a bean?

02:58.633 --> 03:00.818
Well, it's small farms,
very little stools,

03:00.852 --> 03:02.186
and good eyesight.
(Laughs)

03:02.237 --> 03:04.938
That is hilarious.

03:06.357 --> 03:08.108
Oh, whoops.

03:08.143 --> 03:12.496
<i>That is
Phoebe's art project, so...</i>

03:12.530 --> 03:13.497
Let me ask you something.

03:13.531 --> 03:15.783
Does Phoebe have
any other interests?

03:15.817 --> 03:18.852
<i>Oh. Oh, this might look
unconventional to you,</i>

03:18.887 --> 03:20.287
but we want to make sure

03:20.321 --> 03:23.540
that none of mother earth's
resources are wasted.

03:23.591 --> 03:25.492
Somebody's wasted.

03:25.527 --> 03:27.845
Okay, friends.

03:27.879 --> 03:30.380
Why don't we gather around
the community circle, huh?

03:30.432 --> 03:32.232
Ohh.

03:32.267 --> 03:33.600
Yeah!
(Tambourine rattles)

03:33.635 --> 03:35.335
(Child cries)

03:35.353 --> 03:37.387
Come on. Gather around.

03:39.624 --> 03:41.792
(Children crying)

03:44.679 --> 03:46.413
There you go.

03:48.474 --> 03:49.958
(Groans)

03:50.009 --> 03:52.210
(Groans)

03:52.228 --> 03:53.728
That's comfortable.

03:53.763 --> 03:56.281
Okay, friends.
Why don't we teach our guests

03:56.315 --> 03:59.184
the happy happy
welcome song, huh?

03:59.218 --> 04:00.151
Okay.

04:00.186 --> 04:01.786

04:01.821 --> 04:03.455

04:04.957 --> 04:07.025

04:07.059 --> 04:08.393
Snap, snap, snap.

04:08.427 --> 04:10.194
(Moans)

04:10.212 --> 04:13.865
Oh! Oh, uh-oh.
A friend is having a feeling.

04:16.098 --> 04:19.834
Why don't we validate
that feeling?

04:19.868 --> 04:21.937
Are you feeling sad?

04:21.971 --> 04:24.289
Did someone steal your rainbow?

04:24.323 --> 04:28.343
Hey, somebody
stole my patience.

04:28.377 --> 04:30.845
Oh, okay.
Why don't we dig down deep

04:30.863 --> 04:32.647
and try to find
that feeling, Doug?

04:32.682 --> 04:35.133
(Scoffs) Doug.
That's--that's a dude?

04:35.167 --> 04:36.668
(Men laughing)

04:36.719 --> 04:38.320
Who said that?

04:38.354 --> 04:40.822
- He did.
- What?

04:40.856 --> 04:42.958
Doug made the choice
to be a princess today,

04:42.992 --> 04:45.543
and we validate that choice.

04:45.595 --> 04:48.230
That's stupid.

04:48.264 --> 04:49.364
(Chuckles)

04:49.398 --> 04:52.066
Boyd, we don't use
the "s" word here.

04:54.393 --> 04:56.327
It's just a word.
It's a normal word.

04:56.361 --> 04:57.928
Uh, we don't use
the word "normal."

04:57.963 --> 05:01.866
It implies "abnormal,"
which we also don't use.

05:01.900 --> 05:03.768
They're just words.
We got to use words.

05:03.802 --> 05:05.136
Okay, everybody, everybody.

05:05.170 --> 05:07.521
♪ We're happy, we're clappy ♪

05:07.556 --> 05:09.306

05:09.340 --> 05:11.909
Okay! Silent time...

05:11.943 --> 05:13.244
For everybody.

05:13.278 --> 05:16.285
(Clears throat)
Mr. Baxter...

05:16.405 --> 05:18.940
Ho ho...
(Inhales sharply)

05:18.974 --> 05:22.410
Don't you know that words can
hurt just as much as weapons?

05:22.445 --> 05:25.881
Can they? Let's step outside.
You shout a few words at me.

05:25.915 --> 05:27.833
I'll shoot you in the foot
with a crossbow.

05:27.867 --> 05:29.534
Okay.

05:31.154 --> 05:32.521
Uh, Mr. Baxter,

05:32.555 --> 05:34.756
I'm gonna have to ask you
and your energy to leave.

05:34.790 --> 05:37.626
Okay. Why not?
Why don't we just do that?

05:37.660 --> 05:39.427
Thank you.

settle this and smell her head?

06:21.987 --> 06:24.422
I'm fairly certain
I'm not gonna do that.

06:24.456 --> 06:26.190
I want you guys to
take care of this yourselves.

Boyd is the first kid
ever to be expelled.

06:39.037 --> 06:41.539
(Laughs)

06:41.557 --> 06:44.242
He got expelled
from a preschool?

06:44.276 --> 06:45.410
(Chuckles)

06:45.444 --> 06:47.345
That's terrible.

06:47.379 --> 06:50.031
Yeah. They say that
our family energy doesn't mesh.

06:50.082 --> 06:52.417
This totally sucks for Boyd.

06:52.451 --> 06:54.268
All of his little friends
go to that school.

06:54.319 --> 06:56.120
Baby, he's 2 years old.
They're not friends.

06:56.155 --> 06:59.290
They're just little blobs
he talks at.

06:59.324 --> 07:01.109
Okay, I need you
to get on the phone

07:01.143 --> 07:02.627
and beg them to take Boyd back.

07:02.661 --> 07:03.628
(Scoffs) Can't.

07:03.662 --> 07:05.797
- Why not?
- Don't want to.

07:05.831 --> 07:08.466
You know, he imitates your
behavior, and it's not cute.

07:08.484 --> 07:10.001
Well, it's kind of cute.

07:10.035 --> 07:13.805
He's the only 2-year-old I know
that can do a good arm fart.

07:15.656 --> 07:17.874
Dad, this is a real problem.

07:17.908 --> 07:19.259
What am I supposed
to do with Boyd?

07:19.293 --> 07:21.111
I can't take him
to the diner with me.

07:21.145 --> 07:23.046
Well, we find a new preschool.
How about that?

07:23.081 --> 07:24.381
When? Tomorrow?

07:24.415 --> 07:26.800
Because it took me six months
to get him into that one.

07:26.851 --> 07:27.934
Does that make any sense?

07:27.985 --> 07:29.486
It's so competitive
to get into a school

07:29.520 --> 07:31.521
that doesn't like competition.

07:31.556 --> 07:33.006
Dad.

07:33.057 --> 07:34.524
All right, all right.

07:34.559 --> 07:36.660
Well, for the next couple days,
I can take him to work with me.

07:36.694 --> 07:38.795
Fine. (Sighs)

07:38.830 --> 07:41.465
I'm desperate, and I don't
see any wolves available

07:41.499 --> 07:44.117
to watch him, so I guess
you're the next best thing.

of Boyd's.

07:59.283 --> 08:01.284
Honey, that's your mess.

08:01.319 --> 08:02.986
You're gonna need
to clean that up.

08:03.020 --> 08:05.922
Meanwhile, back to my neck.
Just...

08:05.957 --> 08:07.557
What's the matter
with your neck?

08:07.592 --> 08:10.577
Can you believe that old bat
thought I was her age?

08:10.611 --> 08:11.962
I mean, look at me.

08:11.996 --> 08:14.030
I'm--I'm way too young
to have an adult daughter,

08:14.065 --> 08:15.808
never mind a grandson.

08:15.928 --> 08:18.245
Yeah, babies having babies.

08:18.365 --> 08:20.599
Yeah, yeah, and the one day
I wear comfortable pants,

08:20.617 --> 08:22.868
I get called out
as an old lady?

08:22.886 --> 08:25.204
Honey, be honest.
How--how old do I look?

08:25.238 --> 08:26.605
25.

08:26.640 --> 08:27.840
Oh, be serious.

08:27.874 --> 08:29.341
All right. 45.

08:29.376 --> 08:30.976
Not that serious.

35.

08:32.245 --> 08:34.746
17. Please make this stop.

08:36.168 --> 08:37.301
Hey, mom...

08:37.335 --> 08:38.269
I wouldn't.

08:38.303 --> 08:39.602
What was
Eleanor Roosevelt like?

08:39.638 --> 08:44.358
You really think I'm that old
that I knew her?

08:44.409 --> 08:46.510
No, but you know
about history, though.

08:46.545 --> 08:48.262
Like, when did
the Great Depression end?

08:48.313 --> 08:50.231

Nope.

Nope.

09:37.641 --> 09:39.142
It's a bouncy house.

09:39.176 --> 09:42.245
I put a Sierra tent
on some inflatable rafts.

09:42.279 --> 09:43.613
(Chuckles) Looks like fun.

09:43.631 --> 09:44.581
Yeah.

09:44.615 --> 09:46.616
Get it out of here.

09:46.650 --> 09:49.486
Hey, boss. Boss.
Ed. Ed. It's for Boyd.

09:49.520 --> 09:51.020
I got him kicked out
of a preschool,

09:51.054 --> 09:54.257
which I can't say
without smiling.

09:54.291 --> 09:56.309
Mike, this is a business,
not a day care.

09:56.343 --> 09:57.827
It won't slow anybody down.

09:57.862 --> 10:00.196
(Laughs)

10:00.231 --> 10:02.682
That is awesome.

10:02.716 --> 10:05.134
This is exactly
what I'm talking about.

10:05.169 --> 10:07.203
We need people working.
Instead, you've got--

10:07.238 --> 10:09.605
you got Kyle in there,
bouncing around with Boyd.

10:09.623 --> 10:11.741
Boyd's not in there.
What?

10:11.759 --> 10:13.676
He's off making s'mores
with Frank in camping.

10:13.711 --> 10:15.945
Everybody's pretty psyched
to hang out with him.

10:15.980 --> 10:18.681
Can't you put that kid
in a little crate?

10:18.716 --> 10:22.252
You know, I can see why you're
not close to your children.

10:22.988 --> 10:25.254
<i>(Dance music playing)</i>

10:31.218 --> 10:35.025
Oh, wow. (Laughs)

10:35.145 --> 10:36.545
That... is cute.

10:36.580 --> 10:38.531
That's pants.

10:41.718 --> 10:43.469
Oh.

10:43.520 --> 10:45.855
(Chuckles) It's, uh...

10:45.889 --> 10:47.606
(Chuckles)

10:47.657 --> 10:51.960
Are they half off?
Because they're short.

10:51.978 --> 10:53.929
Yeah, I get it.
(Forces chuckle)

10:53.947 --> 10:57.532
Uh, so do you, uh,
do you have 'em in a 6?

10:57.551 --> 11:00.502
We have zero
all the way through 2.

11:01.805 --> 11:03.706
Uh...

11:03.740 --> 11:05.975
I'll try three 2s.

11:06.009 --> 11:07.828
Okay.

11:11.174 --> 11:13.242
Mom?

11:13.277 --> 11:14.628
Mandy!

11:14.748 --> 11:17.349
Have you run out of ways
to embarrass me?

11:17.383 --> 11:19.151
Well, a-aren't you
supposed to be studying?

11:19.185 --> 11:21.387
<i>I'm on a break.
What are you doing here?</i>

11:21.421 --> 11:22.988
I--just--I'm shopping.

11:23.023 --> 11:27.159
I'm--I'm trying to find a cute,
um, one of these... things.

11:27.193 --> 11:28.593
(Whispers) Oh, mama.

11:28.611 --> 11:30.462
(Normal voice) You're ready
for a new look. Listen to me.

11:30.497 --> 11:32.564
I'm going to fix you.
Come with me. Come on.

11:32.582 --> 11:35.250
<i>It is going to be...
(Singsongy) Amazing!</i>

11:35.285 --> 11:36.769
<i>You are going to look bananas!</i>

11:36.803 --> 11:41.173
We didn't have three 2s,
so I brought you six 1s.

11:45.211 --> 11:46.779
(Kyle) Almost done, boss.

11:46.813 --> 11:48.047
Hey, Kyle, what is this?

11:48.081 --> 11:50.649
I said a fort for Boyd,
not a shantytown.

11:51.985 --> 11:54.486
I'm doing the best I can.
I'm not an architect.

11:54.521 --> 11:57.156
Go ahead. Be disappointed in me
like my father...

11:57.190 --> 12:00.325
The architect.

12:00.360 --> 12:04.730
Boy, quit crying, aunt Susan.
I just asked you a question.

12:04.981 --> 12:07.049
Hey, uh, isn't that
don from shipping?

12:07.083 --> 12:09.385
Isn't he supposed to be taking
Boyd for a ride on the forklift?

12:09.419 --> 12:11.553
Uh, no, uh,
Neal from edged weapons

12:11.588 --> 12:13.439
took him to pet
the animal heads.

12:13.490 --> 12:16.492
Neal's in my office,
so who's got the kid?

12:16.526 --> 12:18.527
What are you feeding this kid?

12:20.263 --> 12:22.831
I've seen bears
drop smaller loads

12:22.849 --> 12:24.366
than this little bombardier.

12:24.401 --> 12:26.168
(Thud)

12:26.202 --> 12:28.337
Look who's come around to Boyd.

12:28.371 --> 12:29.655
Well, I'm not made of stone.

12:29.706 --> 12:33.309
I've got some titanium
in my left leg, but no stone.

12:33.343 --> 12:35.077
Look at this--

12:35.352 --> 12:38.288
pack of wolves
taking care of its cub.

12:38.322 --> 12:40.123
We don't need
no stinking preschool.

12:40.157 --> 12:43.092
You got papa wolf there,
changing diapers.

12:43.127 --> 12:46.095
You got timber wolf here,
building a nice, little fort.

12:46.130 --> 12:50.199
Got curly wolf here, forging
for pork rinds for the boy.

12:50.234 --> 12:51.751
Come on!

12:51.802 --> 12:55.305
(Groans) I'm exhausted.

12:55.339 --> 12:57.507
It's been a long day.

12:57.541 --> 13:02.579
I say we head home, we start
first thing in the morning, huh?

13:02.613 --> 13:04.881
It's 11:00 A.M., Mike.

13:06.750 --> 13:08.151
(Sighs)

13:08.185 --> 13:11.437
We got to find you a preschool.

13:18.570 --> 13:21.717
Yeah, I understand everything,
sure. Can he start Monday?

13:22.108 --> 13:26.464
Great. He'll start--
14 months from Monday?

13:26.584 --> 13:29.186
That's like high school.

13:29.220 --> 13:33.948
That's not gonna work.
Yeah, thanks a lot.

13:34.068 --> 13:35.567
How we doing
on that search, Mike?

13:35.687 --> 13:38.255
Not so good. I got him
wait-listed at a cooking school.

13:38.290 --> 13:40.191
That's the best I can do.

13:40.225 --> 13:44.177
For God's sakes,
the guys are exhausted.

13:44.212 --> 13:45.546
We got no work done.

13:45.666 --> 13:47.858
Come on, please,
call that school and apologize.

13:47.978 --> 13:51.948
Apologizing to that guy would go
against everything I believe in.

13:51.982 --> 13:53.616
(Thud)

13:56.913 --> 13:58.931
Let me tell you a little story.

13:58.982 --> 14:04.086
(Grunts) I once had a-a buckshot
supplier, a real jack-wang,

14:04.120 --> 14:07.923
who demanded that I apologize
for something I did not do.

14:07.958 --> 14:12.127
All right? Now my pride
was gonna cost me a bundle.

14:13.455 --> 14:14.583
Ask me what I did.

14:14.703 --> 14:16.076
- All right.
- I'll tell you what I did.

14:16.196 --> 14:16.796
All right.

14:16.916 --> 14:18.213
I apologized,

14:18.248 --> 14:20.716
and it was hard, but it was
the right thing to do,

14:20.750 --> 14:23.719
and at the end of the day,
I felt very good about it.

14:23.753 --> 14:26.154
All right? So...

14:26.188 --> 14:28.073
Especially after I hired a guy

14:28.124 --> 14:31.193
to take a shovel
to his Maserati.

14:35.796 --> 14:37.029
Are you sure
we don't look silly?

14:37.047 --> 14:38.715
No, mama, we look hot.

14:38.749 --> 14:42.435
I don't know about hot.
Do I look hot?

14:42.469 --> 14:45.121
Uh, mom?

14:45.172 --> 14:46.239
Why do you look like Mandy?

14:46.273 --> 14:47.473
Hey, check it out.

14:47.508 --> 14:49.208
We totally got rooster feathers
in our hair. Look.

14:49.243 --> 14:51.344
Yeah, we totally did.

14:51.378 --> 14:53.046
What do you think?

14:53.080 --> 14:54.631
<i>You went over to her side?</i>

14:54.682 --> 14:55.949
No, I'm not on anybody's side.

14:55.983 --> 14:57.750
But I needed you to help me with
my history homework.

14:57.785 --> 14:58.918
I can still help you.

14:58.953 --> 15:01.154
You can't look like her
and know things.

15:01.188 --> 15:04.795
You know, personally, I'd rather
be attractive than smart.

15:04.915 --> 15:07.546
- Yeah, you made that pretty clear.
- Get outta here.

15:07.666 --> 15:09.367
Eve, honey, it's no big deal.

15:09.401 --> 15:12.036
I'm just--I'm trying
to be more... fashionable.

15:12.070 --> 15:13.871
Yeah, but what I love
most about you is,

15:13.905 --> 15:15.573
you just don't care
how you look.

15:15.607 --> 15:17.942
Aw. That's really nice...

15:17.976 --> 15:19.860
And deeply insulting.

15:23.512 --> 15:26.797
(Hums)

15:29.768 --> 15:31.202
Are those feathers?

15:31.236 --> 15:32.203
Yeah.

15:32.237 --> 15:33.187
Okay.

15:37.209 --> 15:39.794
So--so--so you hate them?

15:39.828 --> 15:40.845
What?

15:40.879 --> 15:42.947
The feathers,
th--you hate them.

15:42.981 --> 15:44.515
Forget it. I don't care.
I'm just--I'm...

15:44.533 --> 15:46.150
- Something's wrong, isn't it?
- No. No, no. It's not--

15:46.184 --> 15:47.752
I know when something's wrong.
You know how I know?

15:47.786 --> 15:50.021
'Cause I'm in tune with
your lady moods. All right.

15:52.318 --> 15:53.952
Plus I noticed
somebody pounded down

15:53.986 --> 15:56.220
a brick of
baker's chocolate back there.

15:58.023 --> 16:00.625
(Voice breaks)
I'm a grandmother.

16:00.659 --> 16:03.861
You just found that out?

16:03.896 --> 16:05.596
(Sighs)

16:05.631 --> 16:07.832
I knew I was a grandmother,
but I just--

16:07.866 --> 16:11.919
I just--I never thought
of myself as a... grandmother,

16:11.954 --> 16:13.421
but--but it's true.

16:13.455 --> 16:17.942
I-I-I do all
these old lady things.

16:17.977 --> 16:19.577
What old lady things?

16:19.611 --> 16:21.245
I wear sensible shoes.

16:21.263 --> 16:24.549
I-I-I always have candy
in my purse. I...

16:27.155 --> 16:31.659
I enjoy getting knots
out of jewelry.

16:31.693 --> 16:36.230
I wish I had known you always
have candy in your purse.

16:41.184 --> 16:43.452
Where did our youth go?

16:43.487 --> 16:45.488
The girls took it from us.

16:45.522 --> 16:49.625
Come on, baby, there's no reason
to get upset about this.

16:49.659 --> 16:51.060
If you're so okay
with getting older,

16:51.094 --> 16:53.028
why don't you let Boyd
call you grandpa?

16:53.063 --> 16:56.999
It's not my fault that he
insists on calling me "Champ."

16:57.033 --> 17:00.069
He calls me "Granny Goose."
Yeah.

17:00.103 --> 17:03.906
That may, in fact, be my fault.

17:04.347 --> 17:09.050
Come on, babe. It's silly.
It's the march of time.

17:09.085 --> 17:10.920
Days go by.
We can't stop that.

17:10.954 --> 17:13.255
We both get older.
That's how it is.

17:13.290 --> 17:15.723
Let's have a baby.

17:17.641 --> 17:18.808
What?

17:18.842 --> 17:21.810
Yeah. Women my age are
having babies all the time.

17:21.828 --> 17:24.747
Where?

17:24.781 --> 17:27.782
Everywhere...
Some places...

17:27.818 --> 17:29.919
New York.

17:29.953 --> 17:33.289
I looked so young
when I was pregnant.

17:33.323 --> 17:36.726
<i>'Cause you were young
when you were pregnant.</i>

17:37.093 --> 17:38.944
You got to be kidding me.

17:38.978 --> 17:40.529
We can't do it.
I don't have the energy.

17:40.563 --> 17:42.564
I had Boyd for eight hours
today at work.

17:42.582 --> 17:45.300
A team of seven men
were exhausted.

17:45.335 --> 17:49.271
Two of those men
climbed Everest with no oxygen.

17:49.305 --> 17:51.356
Don't you remember
when I was a new mother?

17:51.407 --> 17:53.008
I was just--
I was so vibrant--

17:53.042 --> 17:55.711
no, no, no, no, no. You were
sleep-deprived. You were crazy.

17:55.745 --> 17:58.730
- And--and no one cared that I always
had food in my hair. - We all cared.

17:58.781 --> 18:01.249
We all cared. We just
talked behind your back.

18:01.284 --> 18:03.001
My boobs were giant.

18:03.052 --> 18:05.454
We could talk about a kid.

18:07.686 --> 18:09.354
(Eve) Mom!
(Mandy) Mom!

18:09.388 --> 18:11.356
- Oh, jeez.
- I caught Eve using my shampoo!

18:11.390 --> 18:14.158
I was moving it
to get to my shampoo!

18:14.193 --> 18:16.094
I don't want to smell
like Eva Longoria!

18:16.128 --> 18:18.896
Oh, but she smells like lavender
and--and all things pretty!

18:20.966 --> 18:23.668
Girls! Go to your rooms
and shut your doors!

18:23.702 --> 18:25.169
(Doors slam)

18:26.238 --> 18:29.173
Okay, maybe not another baby.

18:29.191 --> 18:32.443
Listen, for whatever it's worth,
I think you're beautiful,

18:32.478 --> 18:35.546
and I think you're getting
more beautiful every single day,

18:35.581 --> 18:37.782
and there's no one
I would rather walk with

18:37.816 --> 18:42.587
towards the sweet release
of death than you.

18:45.201 --> 18:48.470
It's a good thing you don't
write songs anymore. (Chuckles)

18:48.505 --> 18:49.438
Mm.

18:49.472 --> 18:50.906
Mm.

18:50.940 --> 18:52.358
(Sniffs)

18:52.392 --> 18:54.026
What...

18:54.060 --> 18:56.178
What smells like lavender?

18:56.212 --> 18:59.248
Nothing.

18:59.282 --> 19:03.318
<i>You're using
Mandy's Eva Longoria.</i>

19:03.353 --> 19:05.821
No, I'm not.

19:05.855 --> 19:07.823
(Laughs) Oh,
I don't believe you.

19:08.842 --> 19:10.826
I'm a big fan of hers.

19:10.860 --> 19:12.494
(Laughs) Oh, Mike.

19:17.223 --> 19:19.057
Thanks for doing this.

19:19.091 --> 19:20.525
It's the right thing to do.

19:20.559 --> 19:25.146
Sorry to keep you waiting.
I was meditating and I ran long.

19:26.482 --> 19:29.284
Well, it could happen to anybody.

19:29.335 --> 19:32.637
Listen, I want to apologize
for my behavior the other day--

19:32.671 --> 19:35.140
everything I said, everything
I did, everything I am.

19:35.174 --> 19:38.243
From a molecular level,
I am just sorry.

19:38.277 --> 19:42.147
- Wow. I think that is wonderful.
- Mm-hmm.

19:42.475 --> 19:44.776
I really like
what you've said here today.

19:44.811 --> 19:46.077
So we're good.

19:46.112 --> 19:47.746
We're good, we're done.
Yeah. Uh-huh.

19:47.780 --> 19:49.164
Let's, uh, let's get Boyd
back here on Monday.

19:49.198 --> 19:50.649
We got to un-teach him

19:50.683 --> 19:51.950
all the stuff
that grandpa taught him.

19:51.984 --> 19:53.251
- Right, we'll see you Monday.
- Okay.

19:53.286 --> 19:55.487
Wait. You say this school's
all about acceptance,

19:55.505 --> 19:58.223
but you're being kind of
judge-y about my dad.

19:58.257 --> 20:00.358
Hey, no harm, no foul. What do
you say we get outta here?

20:00.393 --> 20:02.594
Well, there is a lot to judge.

20:02.628 --> 20:05.730
It would take all of my charcoal
to sketch his aura.

20:05.765 --> 20:07.632
Well, you'd need more
than charcoal.

20:07.667 --> 20:10.802
Hey, my dad did a pretty good
job raising three girls.

20:10.837 --> 20:13.939
Well, two out of three.

20:13.973 --> 20:16.708
And if Boyd ended up
like his grandpa,

20:16.742 --> 20:18.376
I would not be devastated.

20:18.411 --> 20:19.794
So we'll see you Monday.

20:19.829 --> 20:21.413
You know what?

20:21.447 --> 20:22.514
I don't even know if I want
my son coming to this school.

20:22.548 --> 20:23.949
- Oh, sure you do.
- In fact,

20:23.983 --> 20:26.501
I would rather that he spend
every day at work with my dad!

20:26.552 --> 20:29.955
Happy happy snappy
crappy snappy happy happy...

20:35.150 --> 20:36.651
Hey.

20:36.685 --> 20:37.719
Hi.

20:37.753 --> 20:39.253
Well, if it isn't
the most beautiful,

20:39.288 --> 20:41.689
sexy, youthful wife
that I know.

20:41.724 --> 20:43.624
Me?

20:43.659 --> 20:44.659
Yeah.

20:44.693 --> 20:46.995
Oh, wow. Thank you. Oh.

20:47.029 --> 20:48.195
And guess what we're
gonna do tonight?

20:48.213 --> 20:49.196
What?

20:49.214 --> 20:51.899
Get dressed up,
go out to a nice dinner.

20:51.934 --> 20:53.534
Then maybe we'll go dancing,

20:53.552 --> 20:56.220
and I mean till dawn.
Let's par-tay.

20:56.255 --> 20:58.606
Wow. (Chuckles)

20:58.640 --> 21:00.675
That sounds like a lot of fun.

21:00.709 --> 21:01.642
Doesn't it?

21:01.677 --> 21:03.478
It does. It does.

21:03.512 --> 21:05.146
Huh?

21:05.180 --> 21:07.115
Or...

21:08.517 --> 21:14.088
We could eat cereal in bed
and read our books.

21:14.123 --> 21:16.441
I was hoping you'd say that.

21:16.492 --> 21:20.244
Oh, high fiber for me.
It's easier to digest.

21:20.279 --> 21:23.197
Preaching to the choir.

21:23.198 --> 21:25.998
