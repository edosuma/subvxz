<i>NARRATOR:
In November 2009,</i>

00:01.634 --> 00:03.367
<i>Uncle Marshall
and Aunt Lily hosted</i>

00:03.367 --> 00:05.500
<i>the first Thanksgiving
at their very own apartment.</i>

00:05.500 --> 00:08.367
<i>And Marshall had found
the perfect turkey.</i>

00:08.367 --> 00:11.634
Oh, baby, it is beautiful.

00:11.634 --> 00:14.300
It's 22 pounds.
It's organic.

00:14.300 --> 00:16.234
You remember my bald
Uncle Heinrek?

00:16.234 --> 00:18.333
It looks exactly like his head.

00:18.333 --> 00:19.901
Oh, my God.

00:19.901 --> 00:21.433
My turkey...

00:21.433 --> 00:23.300
My turkey!

00:24.300 --> 00:26.934
<i>So, when we showed up
for the big day,</i>

00:26.934 --> 00:28.101
<i>Marshall was pretty bummed out.</i>

00:28.101 --> 00:30.134
Well, we got the turkey.
MARSHALL: No.

00:30.134 --> 00:32.067
You didn't. You got the pathetic
replacement turkey.

00:32.067 --> 00:33.967
Damn it, you know,
why didn't I just listen

00:33.967 --> 00:36.134
to the prerecorded voice
of former Mayor Ed Koch

00:36.134 --> 00:37.600
reminding me
to take my belongings?

00:37.600 --> 00:40.400
No, Marshall,
you don't understand.

00:40.400 --> 00:42.767
Robin and I went to the Port
Authority Lost and Found,

00:42.767 --> 00:44.667
and there,
sitting in their fridge...

00:44.667 --> 00:46.101
ROBIN: Marshall Eriksen...

00:46.101 --> 00:48.901
is this your turkey?
Yes!

00:48.901 --> 00:50.567
That's my turkey!

00:50.567 --> 00:53.234
Oh, come here,
you handsome little bastard!

00:53.234 --> 00:55.734
Okay, I'm going to go put this in the oven.
Okay.

00:55.734 --> 00:58.367
Oh, my God! You guys are
the best friends ever!

00:59.201 --> 01:01.201
It was totally
a team effort.

01:01.201 --> 01:03.667
I'm so ha...

01:03.667 --> 01:05.634
Guys, I don't know
what to say.

01:05.634 --> 01:07.201
I mean, it's Thanksgiving,
but "thanks"

01:07.201 --> 01:08.534
just doesn't seem like enough.

01:08.534 --> 01:10.367
Come on, buddy, you would've
done the same thing for us.

01:10.368 --> 01:11.368
Yeah, I would, and you know why?

01:11.867 --> 01:12.967
Because I love you guys.

01:13.467 --> 01:15.167
And I'm gonna show you
just how much.

01:15.167 --> 01:18.067
Ted Mosby,
Robin Scherbatsky,

01:18.067 --> 01:20.668
I bequeath unto you

01:20.668 --> 01:21.933
the fourth slap.

01:21.933 --> 01:22.900
(both gasp)

01:22.900 --> 01:24.000
Wait, what?

01:24.000 --> 01:25.100
<i>Kids, you remember</i>

01:25.100 --> 01:27.100
<i>Barney and Marshall'
"Slap Bet."</i>

01:27.100 --> 01:30.234
<i>When Barney lost, Marshall won
the right to slap Barney</i>

01:30.234 --> 01:31.634
<i>five times as hard as he could.</i>

01:31.634 --> 01:34.367
<i>So far, he'd used three
of those five slaps.</i>

01:34.367 --> 01:35.867
(Barney grunts)

01:35.867 --> 01:37.867
<i>With the third
being doled out exactly</i>

01:37.867 --> 01:41.167
<i>two years earlier
on Thanksgiving Day 2007.</i>

01:41.167 --> 01:43.401
<i>A day that history came to know</i>

01:43.401 --> 01:44.933
<i>as "Slapsgiving."</i>

01:44.933 --> 01:46.100
Are you saying...

01:46.100 --> 01:47.601
...what we think
you're saying?

01:47.601 --> 01:49.200
Probably not.

01:49.867 --> 01:51.267
Unless you think I'm saying

01:51.267 --> 01:53.833
"Slapsgiving Two:
Revenge Of The Slap,"

01:53.833 --> 01:56.934
in which case, yes, that's
exactly what I'm saying!

01:57.134 --> 01:59.433
(Ted and Robin cheer)
No way! Uh-uh.

01:59.433 --> 02:00.967
Slaps aren't transferable.

02:00.967 --> 02:02.700
Lily is the Slap Bet
Commissioner.  Lil?

02:03.801 --> 02:05.767
Slaps are transferable.

02:05.767 --> 02:07.634
No!
Transferable!

02:07.634 --> 02:09.133
Wait, Marshall,
you realize you'll only have

02:09.133 --> 02:10.300
one left after this.

02:10.300 --> 02:12.367
Are you sure you want
to spend this slap today?

02:12.367 --> 02:15.034
Life is short.
I figured, Slap-e Diem.

02:15.034 --> 02:17.834
Okay, rule number one: the slap 
must occur before sundown,

02:17.834 --> 02:19.834
so as not to interfere
with Lily's meal.

02:19.834 --> 02:21.333
Damn straight.
Two, you guys have to decide

02:21.333 --> 02:22.901
amongst yourselves
who gets to do it.

02:22.901 --> 02:23.901
Three...

02:23.901 --> 02:25.467
we're going to tie
Barney to this

02:25.467 --> 02:28.034
chair, which shall
henceforth be referred to as

02:28.034 --> 02:30.001
The Slapping Throne. Sound fair?
Totally.

02:30.001 --> 02:31.767
ROBIN: Amazing.
Absolutely not!

02:32.767 --> 02:35.201
<i>It was all set to be the best
Thanksgiving ever.</i>

02:35.201 --> 02:37.067
<i>Until...
(doorbell rings)</i>

02:37.067 --> 02:38.801
Are we expecting somebody else?

02:38.801 --> 02:41.534
<i>It was someone Lily hadn't
seen or spoken to</i>

02:41.534 --> 02:43.700
<i>in three years.</i>

02:43.700 --> 02:45.534
Dad.

02:58.900 --> 03:00.301
<i>Now, Lily and her dad, Mickey,</i>

03:00.301 --> 03:02.501
<i>had always had
a tough relationship.</i>

03:02.501 --> 03:03.833
<i>Mickey's dream was to invent</i>

03:03.833 --> 03:05.768
<i>the next great
American board game.</i>

03:05.768 --> 03:07.734
<i>But his ideas
were always a little off.</i>

03:07.734 --> 03:09.534
Daddy?
Yeah?

03:09.534 --> 03:11.668
You missed
my ballet recital.

03:11.668 --> 03:13.167
Yes, sweetie, but, look!

03:13.167 --> 03:16.267
I just put the finishing touches
on my new, hit board game,

03:16.267 --> 03:18.768
"Tijuana Slumlord."

03:19.200 --> 03:20.267
Daddy?
Uh-huh?

03:20.268 --> 03:21.268
You missed my gymnastics meet.
Yeah, yeah, yeah,

03:23.267 --> 03:25.134
<i>But this is the one!</i>

03:26.100 --> 03:30.134
"Car Battery:
How Long Can You Hold On?"

03:30.134 --> 03:32.067
(chuckling)

03:32.567 --> 03:33.867
Here, Princess.

03:33.867 --> 03:35.134
Grab these.

03:36.067 --> 03:38.168
Daddy?
Mm-hmm.

03:38.168 --> 03:39.634
I had a nightmare.

03:39.634 --> 03:41.934
Aw, sweetie.

03:41.934 --> 03:44.901
Here, come play
Daddy's new game:

03:44.901 --> 03:47.300
"There's A Clown Demon
Under The Bed!"

03:47.300 --> 03:48.700
(screaming)

03:48.700 --> 03:50.867
<i>Her whole life, Mickey
disappointed Lily.</i>

03:50.867 --> 03:54.467
<i>And she always put up with it,
until one day in 2006</i>

03:54.467 --> 03:56.667
<i>when Lily went to visit her
grandparents.</i>

03:56.667 --> 03:58.134
So, Rita, are you
excited about the, uh,

03:58.134 --> 03:59.333
the big move to Florida?

03:59.333 --> 04:01.534
Actually, dear,
slight change of plans.

04:01.534 --> 04:03.801
We're staying here
for the time being.

04:03.801 --> 04:06.433
We had a slight
financial hiccup.

04:06.433 --> 04:07.500
MICKEY:
Ma!

04:07.500 --> 04:10.333
The straw to my juice box broke!

04:12.934 --> 04:14.901
Ma, chop, chop!

04:15.401 --> 04:18.034
Oh, hey, guys.

04:18.034 --> 04:19.867
What a pleasant surprise.

04:19.867 --> 04:21.034
Dad, what happened

04:21.034 --> 04:22.567
to your apartment?

04:22.567 --> 04:24.833
Oh, well, I had a little
falling out with my roommate.

04:24.833 --> 04:25.900
What happened?

04:25.900 --> 04:27.267
He wanted me to pay rent.

04:27.267 --> 04:29.134
Got kind of ugly.
Dad!

04:29.134 --> 04:30.334
You should be paying rent,

04:30.334 --> 04:32.501
not living
in your parents' basement.

04:32.501 --> 04:34.200
Hey, it's not my first choice.

04:34.200 --> 04:36.034
Having the old farts
right upstairs

04:36.034 --> 04:37.501
is crimpin' my style a bit.

04:38.001 --> 04:39.767
Clearly, they're not
getting the whole

04:39.767 --> 04:41.534
"sock on the doorknob" thing.

04:41.534 --> 04:42.667
Oh, they caught you with a girl?

04:42.667 --> 04:45.268
In a way.

04:45.268 --> 04:47.867
Bye, sweetheart.
I'm off to work.

04:47.867 --> 04:49.400
Work? You're retired.

04:49.400 --> 04:51.101
Now that I have
extra mouth to feed,

04:51.101 --> 04:52.867
I had to go back
to the steel mill.

04:52.867 --> 04:54.001
Rita?

04:54.001 --> 04:55.234
Where's my truss?

04:55.234 --> 04:58.500
So, not only did you stop them
From moving to Florida,

04:58.500 --> 05:01.234
but now you forced Grandpa
to go back to work?

05:01.235 --> 05:02.235
Just until I get Aldrin games Unlimted

05:03.234 --> 05:05.767
off the ground
with my new sensation:

05:05.767 --> 05:07.901
"Dog Fight Promoter."

05:08.901 --> 05:11.700
<i>And then Lily gave her dad
a look that Marshall</i>

05:11.700 --> 05:13.567
<i>had only seen
a few times before.</i>

05:13.567 --> 05:17.001
<i>A look we all prayed never
to be on the receiving end of:</i>

05:17.001 --> 05:19.300
<i>her "You're Dead To Me" look.</i>

05:22.934 --> 05:25.767
<i>Which brings us back
to Thanksgiving of 2009.</i>

05:25.767 --> 05:28.168
Hey, Princess.

05:28.168 --> 05:30.300
I brought "Diseases!"

05:34.901 --> 05:35.301
What is he doing here?

05:35.967 --> 05:37.267
I don't know,
but maybe we should,

05:37.267 --> 05:38.501
uh, let him in and find out.

05:38.501 --> 05:39.867
No, I don't want to see him!

05:39.867 --> 05:41.167
Get rid of him!

05:46.700 --> 05:48.534
Hey, Mickey.

05:48.534 --> 05:50.501
Just hang tight, okay?

05:50.501 --> 05:51.568
We'll, we'’ll work this out.

05:51.568 --> 05:52.733
Take your time, amigo.

05:52.733 --> 05:54.967
I'm okays long
as I have "Diseases!"

05:54.967 --> 05:56.501
The fun's infectious.

05:56.501 --> 05:58.834
(both laughing)

06:02.967 --> 06:04.633
God, I hope Lily's okay.

06:04.633 --> 06:06.967
Me, too.
She doesn't talk about it much,

06:06.967 --> 06:09.267
but this thing with her dad
causes her a lot of pain.

06:09.267 --> 06:12.667
Just tell me which one of you's
gonna slap me!

06:12.667 --> 06:14.633
What?
I'm dying over here!

06:15.133 --> 06:16.968
Ted reaches for a chip,
I flinch!

06:16.968 --> 06:18.467
Robin fixes her hair, I flinch!

06:18.467 --> 06:21.300
I'm doing so much flinching.
It's bad for my skin.

06:21.300 --> 06:24.034
I'm getting crow's feet.
Crow's feet!

06:24.934 --> 06:26.534
Lily, come on.
It's been

06:26.534 --> 06:28.567
three years, okay?
That's long enough.

06:28.567 --> 06:32.034
Having him in my life causes me
nothing but stress.

06:32.035 --> 06:35.035
It's just easier for him to be dead to me.

06:35.434 --> 06:37.034
Okay, Lily, look.

06:37.034 --> 06:39.734
I supported you when
our neighbor, Mr. Sias,

06:39.734 --> 06:41.100
was "dead to you."

06:41.100 --> 06:44.068
Hey!
That's our newspaper.

06:44.068 --> 06:46.601
You'll get it back
in 15 minutes.

06:46.601 --> 06:49.867
Make it 20.
I had a steak last night.

06:57.400 --> 06:58.601
And I was fine when your

06:58.601 --> 07:01.034
bridesmaid, Whitney,
was "dead to you."

07:01.034 --> 07:02.567
Oh, Lily!

07:02.567 --> 07:04.367
You look so amazing!

07:04.367 --> 07:05.734
That dress is gorgeous!

07:05.734 --> 07:07.167
Oh, thanks, guys.

07:07.167 --> 07:10.601
Mm, I... I'm just
not a fan of strapless.

07:18.034 --> 07:19.467
I even understood when

07:19.467 --> 07:22.200
Mr. Park from the bodega
downstairs was "dead to you."

07:22.200 --> 07:23.634
One coffee, please.

07:23.634 --> 07:25.068
Oh, but only if you have decaf.

07:25.068 --> 07:26.634
I don't want to be up all night.

07:26.634 --> 07:28.867
Dollar fifty.

07:30.068 --> 07:31.233
Coffee, regular.

07:31.233 --> 07:33.233
Dollar fifty.

07:37.400 --> 07:38.500
Excuse me.

07:39.000 --> 07:40.367
Are you sure mine was decaf?

07:40.367 --> 07:41.867
You just used the same pot.

07:41.867 --> 07:44.568
Oh, I lie to him. Okay?

07:44.568 --> 07:50.501
Oh, okay.

07:50.501 --> 07:53.101
You son of a bitch.

07:54.934 --> 07:56.667
That was not decaf!

08:01.667 --> 08:03.301
(glass breaking)

08:04.301 --> 08:06.167
I supported you

08:06.167 --> 08:09.501
with all of those random people,
but this is your father.

08:09.501 --> 08:12.401
Okay, can't we at least just
give him some turkey?

08:12.401 --> 08:13.867
No.
Come on, Lily.

08:14.367 --> 08:16.901
Please, I can't ask the guy
to leave on Thanksgiving.

08:16.901 --> 08:18.767
Oh, you don't have to ask.

08:18.767 --> 08:21.434
Just tell him that it's really
important that he be here.

08:21.434 --> 08:24.200
And before you know it, he'll be
at a board game convention

08:24.200 --> 08:26.801
in Toledo, giving your braces
money to some guy

08:26.801 --> 08:28.667
claiming to be Milton Bradley.

08:28.667 --> 08:31.534
He was just out trying
to provide for the family.

08:32.034 --> 08:35.600
No. No, that's what my mom did
by working two jobs.

08:35.600 --> 08:37.400
Marshall, that man

08:37.400 --> 08:41.833
broke my heart every single day
for 20 years.

08:43.433 --> 08:46.534
Well, then we'll just give him
some dark meat.

08:47.568 --> 08:48.900
No, seriously, Robin,

08:48.900 --> 08:50.134
you should get the slap.

08:50.134 --> 08:51.733
I mean, you're a great slapper.

08:51.733 --> 08:52.700
In fact, I want

08:52.700 --> 08:54.900
to study slapping
under your tutelage.

08:54.900 --> 08:56.867
I want to be your slap-prentice.

08:58.034 --> 08:59.834
Don't sell yourself
short there, Teddy.

08:59.834 --> 09:01.201
You're a slapping rock star.

09:01.201 --> 09:03.468
Your name should be
Eric Slapton.

09:03.468 --> 09:05.267
Okay, okay, guys,
this is torture.

09:05.267 --> 09:06.434
Just put me in the chair...

09:06.434 --> 09:08.967
Slapping Throne.
And get it over with!

09:08.967 --> 09:11.134
Ok, he's all yours.
No-no-no-no. It's you, I insist.

09:11.634 --> 09:12.968
Okay, I'll do it.
Great.

09:12.968 --> 09:13.601
Wait, what?

09:14.302 --> 09:15.601
I'm just saying, I'll slap him.

09:15.601 --> 09:17.001
What, so that's just, like,

09:17.001 --> 09:18.200
the end of the discussion?

09:18.200 --> 09:20.068
Well, you said I could slap him.

09:20.568 --> 09:23.900
Uh, I was just being nice.

09:23.900 --> 09:26.967
If anyone's gonna slap him,
it's gonna be me.

09:26.967 --> 09:28.900
No, it's not.

09:31.000 --> 09:33.167
This is interesting.

09:34.967 --> 09:37.034
Lily, he's family, okay?

09:37.034 --> 09:39.733
And I'm sorry, but you just
don't cut off family.

09:39.733 --> 09:42.134
Oh, well, that's easy for you
to say when you come

09:42.134 --> 09:45.633
from the most ridiculously close
family in the world.

09:45.633 --> 09:47.401
We are not ridiculously close.

09:47.401 --> 09:48.800
Really?
Yeah.

09:48.800 --> 09:51.267
What about the Eriksen Family
Dinner every single Sunday?

09:51.267 --> 09:53.568
Everything looks delicious,
Mother Eriksen.

09:53.568 --> 09:55.434
Thank you,
Papa Bear.

09:56.434 --> 09:59.800
Marshall, would you
like to say grace?

09:59.800 --> 10:01.167
(on monitor):
Well, I would be

10:01.167 --> 10:02.568
happy to, Mother.

10:02.568 --> 10:06.201
Everyone, please join hands.

10:10.534 --> 10:11.900
Dear Lord...

10:11.900 --> 10:13.834
I'm sorry, but that's weird.

10:13.834 --> 10:15.867
A family should be that close.

10:15.867 --> 10:17.967
And I want our future family
to be that close.

10:17.967 --> 10:19.101
And that includes your dad.

10:19.101 --> 10:21.134
I can't believe
you're taking his side.

10:21.134 --> 10:22.334
Lily...
Let me

10:22.334 --> 10:25.434
be clear on this:
that man will never

10:25.434 --> 10:28.568
cross the threshold
into this home, ever!

10:28.568 --> 10:31.600
It's just gonna be, like,
five more minutes.

10:31.600 --> 10:33.468
Hopefully soon, amigo.

10:33.468 --> 10:36.101
I'm fighting a losing battle
with hemorrhoids here.

10:36.101 --> 10:37.967
Oh, that's one of the diseases?

10:37.967 --> 10:40.334
No.

10:43.633 --> 10:46.000
Ted, there is an hour
before the sun sets,

10:46.000 --> 10:48.633
at which point, neither one
of us gets to slap Barney.

10:48.633 --> 10:50.401
So just let me have it.
I'm the one who had

10:50.401 --> 10:52.134
the idea to call the Port
Authority Lost and Found.

10:52.634 --> 10:54.634
Ooh, that's a good point.
Rebuttal?

10:54.634 --> 10:56.300
I'm the one who slipped
the guy a 20!

10:56.300 --> 10:57.667
Oh, philosophical
conundrum.

10:57.667 --> 11:00.133
Idea versus execution.
Please discuss at length.

11:00.133 --> 11:02.167
I carried that huge turkey
all the way up here.

11:02.168 --> 11:03.568
I paid the cab fare.

11:03.867 --> 11:05.934
Well, you slept
with one of my best friends!

11:05.934 --> 11:08.001
What?! You, you said

11:08.001 --> 11:09.667
you were okay with that.
Well, I'm not!

11:09.667 --> 11:11.601
Well, why didn't you
say something at the time?

11:11.601 --> 11:13.233
Because I'm still in love
with you!

11:16.667 --> 11:18.634
Do you really want to slap
Barney so bad

11:18.634 --> 11:20.901
that you would lie
about being in love with me?

11:20.901 --> 11:22.601
I really want to slap him, okay?

11:23.767 --> 11:26.100
Yes, your dad has made some
mistakes in the past,

11:26.100 --> 11:27.767
but he's a different
person now.

11:28.267 --> 11:30.134
He's moved out of your
grandparents' house.

11:30.134 --> 11:31.301
He's got a job.

11:31.301 --> 11:33.000
He's paying off his IRS debts.

11:33.000 --> 11:34.367
Wait, how do you know all that?

11:36.468 --> 11:37.800
Like, body language.

11:38.967 --> 11:41.834
Okay, well, yeah,
we met for a drink last week.

11:42.867 --> 11:44.334
I mis her a ton.

11:44.334 --> 11:46.334
Little princess.

11:47.034 --> 11:48.700
She ever talk about me?

11:48.700 --> 11:51.767
Yeah. Yeah, like, all the time.

11:51.767 --> 11:54.967
Um, she tells this one really
sweet story about...

11:55.467 --> 11:57.400
So never, huh?
No, not a word.

11:57.400 --> 11:58.801
But...

11:58.801 --> 12:00.467
it doesn't have to be that way.

12:00.467 --> 12:02.367
We can, we can fix this, right?

12:02.367 --> 12:03.734
(scoffs)

12:03.734 --> 12:06.634
You know, I always thought
it'd get fixed at the wedding.

12:07.567 --> 12:10.300
I even wrote a toast.

12:10.300 --> 12:12.701
But then, no invite.

12:14.901 --> 12:17.300
Hell, I haven't even seen a wedding photo.

12:17.300 --> 12:19.068
<i>MARSHALL:
And then, right before my eyes,</i>

12:19.068 --> 12:22.400
<i>your father
broke down crying.</i>

12:22.400 --> 12:24.701
(sobbing)

12:24.701 --> 12:27.834
That's it!
You're coming to Thanksgiving!

12:28.968 --> 12:30.534
You invited him?!

12:31.034 --> 12:32.867
The guy was, like, blabbering.

12:32.867 --> 12:34.900
What was I going to do?
And then, some jerk

12:34.900 --> 12:36.600
at the next table
called him a sissy,

12:36.600 --> 12:38.501
which I thought
was totally uncalled-for.

12:38.501 --> 12:39.600
I can't believe you.

12:39.600 --> 12:41.800
Marshall, what gives you
the right to do that?

12:41.800 --> 12:43.034
You and I are married.

12:43.034 --> 12:45.167
And that means
he's my family, too.

12:52.168 --> 12:54.368
Mickey, come on in.

12:56.000 --> 13:02.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

13:06.033 --> 13:08.201
(timer ticking)
Ted, you better roll quickly.

13:08.201 --> 13:10.034
Your gall bladder's
about to burst.

13:10.034 --> 13:11.900
You know, Mickey, it's been,
like, half an hour.

13:11.900 --> 13:13.434
I think we should
go look for Lily.

13:13.934 --> 13:14.968
Eh, she just needs
some time to cool down.

13:14.968 --> 13:15.801
Let's finish the game.

13:15.801 --> 13:16.868
Yeah, play
another round.

13:17.068 --> 13:18.267
Best of seven!

13:18.267 --> 13:19.367
Damn it, Robin!

13:19.367 --> 13:20.701
I've known Barney the longest.

13:20.701 --> 13:22.034
I get to slap him.

13:22.034 --> 13:24.167
That slap is mine, Mosby.

13:24.167 --> 13:25.934
I've never slapped Barney...

13:25.934 --> 13:27.634
above the waist.

13:27.634 --> 13:29.434
Look, I've wanted to slap Barney
since the moment

13:29.434 --> 13:30.968
I met him! You don't think
that I want

13:30.968 --> 13:33.133
to slap Barney? I've waited...
Wait, wait a minute. Wait a mute!

13:33.133 --> 13:35.968
This slap was supposed to be
a wonderful thing, a gift,

13:36.468 --> 13:39.800
and look, it's turned us
against each other.

13:39.800 --> 13:42.501
My God, you're right.

13:42.501 --> 13:47.034
This once pure fruit has turned
into a poison slapple.

13:47.034 --> 13:49.468
You know what?
Seriously, you take it.

13:49.468 --> 13:50.600
Are you sure?

13:50.600 --> 13:52.367
Slapsolutely.

13:53.134 --> 13:54.234
I really think

13:54.234 --> 13:55.633
that we should
go look for Lily.

13:55.633 --> 13:59.568
Ted? Gall bladder
about to pop.

13:59.568 --> 14:00.700
Okay, it's decided.

14:00.700 --> 14:02.767
Barney, come on. Get in the Throne.
Hmm?

14:02.767 --> 14:04.600
Are you...
Yep. Come on.

14:04.600 --> 14:06.034
Well, you, um...

14:06.034 --> 14:07.900
Uh, well, I guess that is

14:07.900 --> 14:09.900
the best decision, Robin.
I mean...

14:09.900 --> 14:12.501
men are stronger than women.

14:12.501 --> 14:13.733
D-Don't listen to him.

14:13.733 --> 14:15.501
Okay, it's been decided.
Okay.

14:15.501 --> 14:17.667
And that's what you've always
wanted, isn't it, Robin?

14:17.667 --> 14:20.633
A strong man
to take care of you?

14:20.633 --> 14:23.800
I mean, sure. Growing up,
you were a scrapper,

14:23.800 --> 14:25.600
Playing hockey with the boys,

14:25.600 --> 14:27.867
skinning your knees
on the ice.

14:27.867 --> 14:30.334
But what you couldn't
tell your teammates--

14:30.334 --> 14:33.167
what you couldn't
even tell yourself--

14:33.167 --> 14:35.200
was that all you really wanted

14:35.200 --> 14:37.767
was that pretty white dress

14:37.767 --> 14:40.934
in that pretty white chapel.

14:40.935 --> 14:43.935
And at the end of the centre aisle, 

14:43.935 --> 14:47.035
strewn with pretty white flowers,

14:47.035 --> 14:48.935
a man

14:48.935 --> 14:51.202
to do all your slapping for you.

14:51.202 --> 14:52.701
Let me at him!
Robin! Come on!

14:52.701 --> 14:53.634
Hold on!
(dings)

14:53.634 --> 14:55.268
Oh!

14:56.102 --> 14:57.268
Oh, my God.

14:57.268 --> 14:58.235
What just happened?

14:58.235 --> 15:00.701
Sorry, Ted.
Gallbladder burst.

15:00.701 --> 15:02.768
You move back
three spaces.

15:03.268 --> 15:05.002
You come in here,

15:05.002 --> 15:07.902
and you watch your daughter
leave and you don't even care.

15:07.902 --> 15:10.668
And now you've destroyed
Thanksgiving dinner!

15:10.668 --> 15:12.602
Lily-Lily worked
all day on this!

15:12.602 --> 15:14.535
Relax. It's not real bile.

15:14.535 --> 15:17.134
It's just lead-based
paint from China.

15:17.134 --> 15:19.234
And horse bile.

15:19.234 --> 15:21.735
<i>And at that moment,
Marshall gave Mickey a look</i>

15:21.735 --> 15:25.335
<i>none of us has ever
seen him give anyone.</i>

15:25.335 --> 15:26.635
What's this? What's he doing?

15:26.635 --> 15:28.368
Did you swallow
some of that paint?

15:28.368 --> 15:30.468
This is my "you're dead to me" look.

15:30.468 --> 15:32.602
Oh. Oh.
Okay.

15:32.602 --> 15:34.335
Yeah, you know,
Lily's is so much better...

15:34.335 --> 15:36.201
Get out of my house!

15:39.935 --> 15:41.502
Hey.

15:42.968 --> 15:44.068
Mr. Park's, huh?

15:44.068 --> 15:45.601
This is the last place
I expected to find you.

15:45.601 --> 15:47.202
Marshall…
Lily, I'm sorry.

15:47.202 --> 15:49.668
But just hear me out.

15:49.668 --> 15:52.668
I used to think that
family was-was a right.

15:52.668 --> 15:56.435
But it's not. It's a privilege,
and it has to be earned.

15:56.435 --> 15:57.701
I kicked your dad out.

15:57.701 --> 15:58.901
And I promise,

15:58.901 --> 16:02.202
baby, I will... I will never
make you see him again.

16:02.202 --> 16:03.701
Oh, what?

16:03.701 --> 16:05.168
Baby, what-what happened?

16:05.168 --> 16:07.935
(tearfully): Marshall, I came in
here because it was cold

16:07.935 --> 16:10.569
and this was the only
place that was open.

16:10.569 --> 16:13.634
I wasn't even gonna look
Mr. Park in the eye.

16:13.634 --> 16:16.001
And then I found out...

16:16.001 --> 16:17.701
Mr. Park died.

16:19.701 --> 16:20.734
Oh, my God.

16:20.734 --> 16:22.768
He really is dead to me.

16:23.435 --> 16:25.001
And if I feel this bad

16:25.001 --> 16:26.901
about never making up
with Mr. Park,

16:27.901 --> 16:31.202
a guy who meant literally nothing to me…

16:31.202 --> 16:34.801
(sobbing)

16:34.801 --> 16:37.102
We got to go get my dad.

16:37.102 --> 16:38.435
Okay.

16:38.435 --> 16:40.402
<i>NARRATOR:
So that's how</i>

16:40.402 --> 16:42.335
<i>on Thanksgiving 2009,</i>

16:42.335 --> 16:44.801
<i>your Aunt Lily
performed a miracle.</i>

16:44.801 --> 16:47.734
<i>She brought a man
back from the dead.</i>

16:47.734 --> 16:50.268
Everyone.

16:50.268 --> 16:52.035
Before we get started, Barney,

16:52.035 --> 16:55.135
We’re going to need you
on The Slapping Throne.

16:56.135 --> 16:58.135
Slap Bet Commissioner,

16:58.135 --> 17:00.202
surely tying me
to a chair is a breach...

17:00.202 --> 17:02.035
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Less yappin', more slappin'.

17:02.035 --> 17:03.202
(groans)

17:03.202 --> 17:05.367
Ted, Robin. It's two
minutes until sundown.

17:05.367 --> 17:07.035
Have you guys decided
which one of you

17:07.035 --> 17:10.068
is going to get to slap
Barney right in his face?

17:11.733 --> 17:12.800
It's gonna be Ted.

17:12.800 --> 17:14.601
What? Why me?

17:15.101 --> 17:18.233
Last year, you got left at the altar.

17:18.233 --> 17:19.935
You lost your job.

17:19.935 --> 17:22.535
But you've come
such a long way since then.

17:23.335 --> 17:25.801
I'm so proud of you, Ted.

17:25.801 --> 17:29.902
You deserve to slap someone
in his face as hard as you can.

17:30.802 --> 17:31.702
Thanks.

17:31.702 --> 17:33.368
This is the worst.

17:34.501 --> 17:36.635
(clears throat)

17:37.468 --> 17:39.635
(breathing deeply)

17:40.468 --> 17:41.401
Mama!

17:41.901 --> 17:44.168
No, Robin. Look...

17:44.168 --> 17:45.935
You just went through
your own breakup, and...

17:45.935 --> 17:48.569
while I know you and Barney
left it on good terms,

17:48.569 --> 17:50.569
isn't there some part of you,

17:50.569 --> 17:53.368
deep down, that wants to slap him

17:53.368 --> 17:54.701
right in his face?

17:54.701 --> 17:56.202
There is.

17:56.202 --> 17:57.302
I know there is.

17:57.302 --> 17:59.268
This is basically hell on Earth.

18:02.535 --> 18:04.135
Oh...
All right.

18:04.135 --> 18:05.835
(humming, grunting)
Oh...

18:05.835 --> 18:07.202
TED:
You got this.

18:08.302 --> 18:09.569
It hurts!

18:09.569 --> 18:11.868
No. I can't do it.

18:11.868 --> 18:13.601
I can't take this from you, Ted.

18:13.601 --> 18:15.001
Nor I, you.

18:15.001 --> 18:16.268
Oh, thank God.

18:16.268 --> 18:17.901
So, I'd like to
make a gesture.

18:18.901 --> 18:20.368
Mickey?

18:20.801 --> 18:22.102
Oh, no way!

18:22.102 --> 18:24.801
I'm glad you and Lily are
trying to work things out.

18:25.202 --> 18:27.668
So, to welcome you to our little family,

18:28.168 --> 18:30.668
I'd like to offer you this slap.

18:30.668 --> 18:31.635
Really?

18:33.168 --> 18:35.668
Well, I feel a little weird…

18:35.668 --> 18:39.635
I-I just met Barney,

18:39.635 --> 18:41.335
But how often
do you get a chance

18:41.335 --> 18:43.969
to slap someone right in his face?

18:44.868 --> 18:47.501
(groaning)

18:49.868 --> 18:51.134
Soft!

18:51.902 --> 18:53.602
I'm sorry. I can't do it.

18:54.102 --> 18:55.335
Oh, thank God.

18:55.335 --> 18:56.502
Lily…

18:56.502 --> 18:59.535
I know I haven't been
much of a father to you.

18:59.535 --> 19:01.235
You are kidding me.

19:01.735 --> 19:04.735
So for all the ballet
recitals that I missed

19:04.735 --> 19:08.069
for all the art shows that
I should've been at...

19:08.935 --> 19:10.101
...for the wedding gift

19:10.101 --> 19:13.002
that I never got a
chance to give to you...

19:13.002 --> 19:14.802
Princess...

19:14.802 --> 19:17.902
I give this slap to you.

19:17.902 --> 19:19.702
Oh, Daddy!

19:19.702 --> 19:20.868
No.

19:20.868 --> 19:22.101
No, no, no, no.

19:22.101 --> 19:23.468
She is the Slap Bet Commissioner.

19:23.468 --> 19:25.234
She's supposed to remain impartial!

19:25.234 --> 19:28.702
Slap Bet Commissioner
says it's okay.

19:28.702 --> 19:30.902
This is not good.

19:30.902 --> 19:32.069
Okay.

19:32.069 --> 19:33.134
Please, please, please.
Let me...

19:33.134 --> 19:34.335
Shh, shh, shh.
Let me...

19:34.335 --> 19:37.134
Just close your eyes.
It'll be over soon.

19:38.735 --> 19:40.401
Running through a meadow.

19:40.901 --> 19:42.569
I can't do it.

19:42.569 --> 19:44.502
Why can't I do it?

19:44.502 --> 19:47.168
Because this slap

19:47.168 --> 19:49.535
has done exactly what I hoped.

19:49.535 --> 19:51.302
It's brought us all
closer together.

19:51.302 --> 19:53.701
And it's caused us to recognize

19:53.701 --> 19:55.035
both the frailty

19:55.035 --> 19:58.535
and the greatness
in ourselves

19:58.535 --> 19:59.901
and each other.

19:59.901 --> 20:01.569
Oh, give me a break.

20:01.569 --> 20:04.968
And that is why...

20:04.968 --> 20:09.102
there will be no slap today.

20:09.102 --> 20:10.968
(gasps)

20:10.968 --> 20:12.701
Oh, my God!

20:13.201 --> 20:16.802
This is the best Thanksgiving...

20:16.802 --> 20:18.668
That's four!

20:19.169 --> 20:20.169
So, turkey?

20:23.501 --> 20:26.201
