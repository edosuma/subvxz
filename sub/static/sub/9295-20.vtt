00:13.444 --> 00:15.845
Mr. Bauer, you are ordered

00:15.913 --> 00:18.714
to turn the aircraft around
and return to CTU.

00:18.782 --> 00:19.882
Jack's descending.

00:19.950 --> 00:21.350
<i>Air Force choppers
are in pursuit.</i>

00:23.253 --> 00:25.922
We've lost him.

00:25.989 --> 00:28.791
If Jack gets this evidence
and exposes the Russians,

00:28.859 --> 00:30.293
the agreement is over.

00:30.360 --> 00:32.561
The peace agreement
may not be the only casualty.

00:32.628 --> 00:35.031
You covered up
the Russians' involvement.

00:35.098 --> 00:36.599
That's grounds for impeachment.

00:36.667 --> 00:38.868
There's still a chance that CTU

00:38.936 --> 00:40.203
will find Jack.

00:40.270 --> 00:42.772
Even if they do,
the evidence is still out there.

00:42.840 --> 00:46.242
Eventually, it will surface.

00:46.310 --> 00:50.913
You need to control the evidence
by keeping Walsh off the grid.

00:50.981 --> 00:52.748
<i>Classify her
as an enemy combatant</i>

00:52.816 --> 00:55.485
and incarcerate her
in a private facility.

00:55.552 --> 00:56.752
I've authorized

00:56.820 --> 00:58.421
a private interrogation team

00:58.489 --> 00:59.856
to acquire the evidence.

00:59.923 --> 01:00.857
Once we have it,

01:00.924 --> 01:02.592
she'll be irrelevant.

01:02.659 --> 01:04.727
I can't be a part
of this any longer.

01:04.795 --> 01:07.597
Cite my health as the reason
for my resignation.

01:07.664 --> 01:08.998
The president's
ordered your transfer

01:09.066 --> 01:10.166
to an off-site
facility.

01:10.234 --> 01:12.702
What do you mean
off-site facility?

01:12.769 --> 01:14.370
It's a secure location.

01:14.438 --> 01:15.738
Just do what he says, Dana.

01:15.806 --> 01:17.907
Chloe, don't let them do this.

01:17.975 --> 01:19.442
- Let's go.
- Please.

01:19.510 --> 01:21.210
They're gonna kill me. Chloe!

01:21.278 --> 01:22.645
Chloe, please!

01:22.713 --> 01:24.614
You told Bauer
you have evidence.

01:24.681 --> 01:26.749
I have got nothing to tell you.

01:26.817 --> 01:28.317
There is no evidence.

01:28.385 --> 01:30.419
The sooner you tell me,
the easier it'll go.

01:30.487 --> 01:31.654
No!

01:33.390 --> 01:36.425
Mobilizing a sting operation
to be led by Agent Ortiz.

01:36.493 --> 01:37.994
The target is Jack Bauer.

01:39.897 --> 01:41.764
Put your weapons down!

01:41.832 --> 01:43.132
I can't do that, Jack!

01:43.200 --> 01:45.501
Put your weapons down now!

01:45.569 --> 01:47.870
<i>I need you to help me
gain access to Dana Walsh.</i>

01:47.938 --> 01:50.673
I am giving you an opportunity
to make this right,

01:50.741 --> 01:52.275
to make the people
that are responsible

01:52.342 --> 01:53.876
for everything that
happened today accountable.

01:53.944 --> 01:57.280
Chloe said she's in a safe house
a few miles from here.

01:57.347 --> 01:58.347
All right, now it's imperative

01:58.415 --> 01:59.782
that they think I
took you hostage.

01:59.850 --> 02:01.851
Get up!

02:10.092 --> 02:14.030
And though fate has prevented
my husband from being here today

02:14.097 --> 02:17.800
at the culmination
of his life's work,

02:17.868 --> 02:22.572
I know that he is watching us
now, looking down and guiding us

02:22.639 --> 02:27.376
as we take the last steps
towards this historic agreement.

02:30.047 --> 02:33.516
Finally, I would like
to express my gratitude

02:33.584 --> 02:36.919
to President Taylor...

02:39.222 --> 02:42.758
Whose integrity
and moral courage

02:42.826 --> 02:44.894
have been unshakable

02:44.962 --> 02:49.599
during the long course
of these negotiations.

02:49.666 --> 02:53.336
She is someone on whom my
husband built an absolute trust.

02:53.403 --> 02:56.872
And I want to make it clear

02:56.940 --> 03:00.676
that her efforts and the efforts
of the United States government

03:00.744 --> 03:04.847
to rescue him
were nothing short of heroic.

03:04.915 --> 03:09.185
My husband wasn't perfect.

03:11.221 --> 03:13.222
None of us is.

03:16.026 --> 03:20.997
But he carried a perfect idea
in his heart:

03:21.064 --> 03:24.734
That peace is possible.

03:27.738 --> 03:28.671
On this,

03:28.739 --> 03:30.806
the last day of his life,

03:30.874 --> 03:35.611
may the world come together

03:35.679 --> 03:39.115
and prove that he was right.

03:43.687 --> 03:45.321
What a magnificent woman.

03:49.393 --> 03:50.760
Okay.

03:50.827 --> 03:52.028
Who was that on the phone?

03:52.095 --> 03:53.029
Bledsoe.

03:53.096 --> 03:55.231
It's not the best of news, sir.

03:55.298 --> 03:57.366
Dana Walsh isn't being as
cooperative as he'd hoped.

03:57.434 --> 03:59.301
Well, what does he expect?

03:59.369 --> 04:01.103
She's a trained enemy agent;
she's not gonna to break

04:01.171 --> 04:02.204
at the drop of a hat.

04:02.272 --> 04:04.040
Look, I told

04:04.107 --> 04:06.108
President Taylor
what might be necessary,

04:06.176 --> 04:07.843
and she signed off on it.

04:07.911 --> 04:09.345
Bledsoe's a professional, sir.

04:09.413 --> 04:11.847
I'm confident
he'll come through for us.

04:11.915 --> 04:13.883
He better.

04:13.950 --> 04:16.752
Sir, there was one more thing.

04:16.820 --> 04:18.821
Bledsoe wanted confirmation.

04:20.490 --> 04:21.724
About what?

04:21.791 --> 04:23.859
How to deal with Ms. Walsh,
post interrogation.

04:23.927 --> 04:25.761
I thought we settled
that matter.

04:25.829 --> 04:27.430
We did.

04:27.497 --> 04:28.931
So why's he asking?

04:28.999 --> 04:31.534
Just to double check we're still
committed to the same outcome.

04:31.601 --> 04:33.035
And what did you tell him?

04:33.103 --> 04:35.171
We're still committed
to the same outcome.

04:37.207 --> 04:40.643
Not that I have any idea
what you're talking about.

04:40.711 --> 04:41.777
You understand?

04:41.845 --> 04:43.679
Perfectly, sir.

04:55.826 --> 04:57.093
Let her up.

05:04.701 --> 05:06.602
I'll give you a little tip.

05:06.670 --> 05:08.437
Take short, shallow breaths.

05:08.505 --> 05:10.706
You'll recover faster.

05:10.774 --> 05:13.275
And then we won't have so much
downtime between sessions.

05:15.245 --> 05:17.313
It's up to you, you know.

05:17.380 --> 05:20.116
You can stop this
whenever you want.

05:20.183 --> 05:22.852
All you have to do is tell
me what I want to know.

05:22.919 --> 05:25.688
I told you
that I was making it up.

05:25.756 --> 05:27.423
There is no evidence.

05:27.491 --> 05:30.159
You told Jack Bauer
you had proof that elements in

05:30.227 --> 05:31.360
the Russian government
were behind

05:31.428 --> 05:33.329
the assassination
of President Hassan.

05:33.396 --> 05:35.064
I was bluffing.

05:35.132 --> 05:36.132
Stalling for time.

05:36.199 --> 05:37.133
There isn't any proof.

05:37.200 --> 05:39.668
Don't lie to me.
I'm not lying.

05:39.736 --> 05:41.904
We begin again in ten seconds.

05:43.940 --> 05:46.442
Seven, six...

05:46.510 --> 05:48.844
Bring it on, you son of a bitch.

05:48.912 --> 05:51.080
Put her down.

05:56.119 --> 05:57.386
Where's the evidence?

05:59.422 --> 06:00.356
Go to hell.

06:00.423 --> 06:01.690
Gag her.

06:14.437 --> 06:16.472
* *

06:37.093 --> 06:38.694
Okay.

06:38.762 --> 06:40.963
They got two sentries
out in front in a black sedan,

06:41.031 --> 06:42.464
one lookout on the roof,

06:42.532 --> 06:45.067
most likely another across the
street, but I couldn't see him.

06:45.135 --> 06:47.336
We can access the back of the
building through that alley.

06:47.404 --> 06:49.038
So, once we get Dana,
what then?

06:49.105 --> 06:51.106
As painful as it is,
we got to cut a deal

06:51.174 --> 06:52.107
in exchange for the evidence.

06:52.175 --> 06:53.375
You mean let her go.

06:53.443 --> 06:55.344
Cole, we both
lost friends today.

06:55.412 --> 06:57.546
And Dana had a hand in that,

06:57.614 --> 06:58.881
but only a hand.

06:58.949 --> 07:00.749
If we can get
the people in charge,

07:00.817 --> 07:02.418
the people that gave the orders,

07:02.485 --> 07:04.186
it'll be worth it.

07:06.323 --> 07:07.756
It's Chloe.

07:07.824 --> 07:09.491
Answer it.

07:09.559 --> 07:10.826
Otherwise, she'll know
something's wrong.

07:10.894 --> 07:12.394
If she doesn't already.

07:12.462 --> 07:13.529
Hello.

07:13.597 --> 07:14.864
Cole, what's your ETA?

07:14.931 --> 07:16.899
Ten minutes.
FDR Drive was a mess.

07:16.967 --> 07:18.434
We're coming up
First Ave instead.

07:18.501 --> 07:20.202
Is Jack with you?

07:21.338 --> 07:22.271
Yeah, I got him.

07:22.339 --> 07:23.505
He's locked down in the back.

07:23.573 --> 07:25.941
I'm glad we found him
before he got hurt.

07:26.009 --> 07:26.942
Or worse.

07:27.010 --> 07:27.943
Yeah.

07:28.011 --> 07:29.411
I've known Jack for a long time,

07:29.479 --> 07:31.347
and I've never
seen him like this.

07:31.414 --> 07:33.949
He threatened me;
he's never done that before.

07:37.254 --> 07:39.588
You did the right thing, Chloe.

07:39.656 --> 07:42.625
Thanks for saying that.

07:42.692 --> 07:44.360
I'll talk to you
when you get here.

07:44.427 --> 07:45.928
Yeah.

07:45.996 --> 07:46.929
We're good.

07:46.997 --> 07:49.064
She has no idea.

07:49.132 --> 07:50.633
Don't be too hard on her, Jack.

07:50.700 --> 07:52.201
She was only doing
what she thought

07:52.269 --> 07:53.569
was best for you.
I know.

07:55.472 --> 07:57.706
Almost forgot.

07:57.774 --> 07:58.874
You're gonna need these.

08:03.780 --> 08:05.781
I'm sorry, I just couldn't
take the chance.

08:05.849 --> 08:07.950
Son of a bitch.

08:08.018 --> 08:09.818
Yeah, I know.

08:09.886 --> 08:11.620
You ready?

08:11.688 --> 08:12.621
Yeah.

08:12.689 --> 08:14.657
Let's go.

08:17.661 --> 08:18.661
Keep your head down.

08:27.137 --> 08:28.637
Go.

08:35.511 --> 08:38.013
That's right, four hours prior
to the signing ceremony,

08:38.081 --> 08:40.582
all available field units
will be redeployed to the U.N.

08:40.650 --> 08:43.152
Mobile HQ is being
set up on the first floor,

08:43.219 --> 08:44.586
adjacent to the
high commissioner's offices.

08:44.654 --> 08:46.922
Hold on a second;
I got O'Brian on the other line.

08:46.990 --> 08:49.291
Yeah?
Who's the psych officer on duty?

08:49.359 --> 08:51.694
That would be Melissa Anderson.

08:51.761 --> 08:53.395
She did all the
grief counseling last night.

08:53.463 --> 08:55.965
Make sure she's the first person
Jack sees when he gets here.

08:56.032 --> 08:57.933
I want a complete eval.

08:58.001 --> 08:59.301
You really think
that's necessary?

08:59.369 --> 09:01.804
I wouldn't have
ordered it if I didn't.

09:01.871 --> 09:04.306
I'll let her know.

09:57.127 --> 09:58.060
I got a visual.

09:58.128 --> 09:59.695
They got one man on the roof.

10:09.205 --> 10:10.439
Okay.

10:10.507 --> 10:14.209
Wait till I get into position,
then you draw them out.

10:24.621 --> 10:26.288
All units, this is Command.

10:26.356 --> 10:27.289
Please report.

10:27.357 --> 10:29.258
Command, this is unit one.
All clear.

10:29.325 --> 10:31.160
Unit two. Street's clear.

10:31.227 --> 10:33.228
Unit three. Back alley's clear.

10:33.296 --> 10:35.197
Command, this is unit four.
Roof's clear.

10:35.265 --> 10:36.198
All units, copy that.

10:36.266 --> 10:37.266
Stay alert.

11:03.460 --> 11:05.294
We're clear.

11:10.567 --> 11:11.900
Let's go.

11:41.364 --> 11:43.298
* *

12:12.395 --> 12:14.429
* *

12:43.426 --> 12:45.327
* *

12:52.945 --> 12:54.979
You make that cover.
I'll draw him out.

13:04.389 --> 13:07.258
Command, I'm taking
sniper fire on the roof.

13:07.326 --> 13:08.759
The building across the street.

13:08.827 --> 13:09.827
I need backup now.

13:09.895 --> 13:10.928
Unit four, stand by.

13:10.996 --> 13:12.163
I'm sending backup now.

13:12.231 --> 13:13.631
Copy that. Hurry!

13:13.699 --> 13:15.533
All units to the roof.

13:15.601 --> 13:17.235
Unit four is reporting
sniper fire.

13:17.302 --> 13:19.871
Repeat: all units to the roof.

13:19.938 --> 13:21.806
Unit four is under sniper fire.

13:40.192 --> 13:41.759
Go.

13:41.827 --> 13:42.894
Go.

13:47.699 --> 13:49.100
Command, we're on the roof.

13:49.168 --> 13:50.868
It's quiet; there's
no sign of Mullins.

13:50.936 --> 13:52.203
Come again?

13:52.271 --> 13:54.839
All's quiet, but we can locate
Unit four.

13:54.907 --> 13:56.474
Unit four, come in, please.

13:56.542 --> 13:58.309
Where's Dana Walsh?

14:01.013 --> 14:04.115
Where is she?

14:04.183 --> 14:05.650
Command, Mullins is down, sir.

14:05.717 --> 14:06.984
Last chance.

14:07.052 --> 14:08.553
Repeat: Mullins is down.

14:08.620 --> 14:09.620
First room on the left.

14:09.688 --> 14:10.688
Thank you.

14:11.857 --> 14:12.857
Command, do you copy?

14:12.925 --> 14:15.059
Command, come in.

14:16.028 --> 14:17.161
We're clear.

14:17.229 --> 14:20.097
The first room on the left,
I've got it.

14:24.803 --> 14:25.870
Put your gun down now!

14:25.938 --> 14:26.904
No, you drop your weapon

14:26.972 --> 14:28.206
or I'll put a bullet
in her brain!

14:28.273 --> 14:29.674
I don't want to kill you,
but I will if I have to.

14:29.741 --> 14:30.841
Put your gun down!

14:30.909 --> 14:32.577
You won't take the shot.
It's too risky.

14:32.644 --> 14:33.678
I'll kill her before...

14:35.581 --> 14:36.881
Cole, untie her.

14:40.085 --> 14:42.119
Cole, now!

14:43.822 --> 14:45.156
Take her out the back.

14:45.224 --> 14:47.391
We're gonna get company soon.
Hurry!

14:50.162 --> 14:52.530
Cole, have you got her?!
Almost!

14:54.600 --> 14:55.700
I got her!

14:55.767 --> 14:57.668
Move! Move!

15:04.710 --> 15:06.377
Stay covered.

15:10.582 --> 15:12.917
Cole, take the stairs now!

15:12.985 --> 15:13.985
Jack!

15:14.052 --> 15:16.087
Get going!
I'll be right behind you!

15:41.506 --> 15:43.040
Chloe.

15:43.108 --> 15:44.308
In a second.

15:44.376 --> 15:46.210
Just finishing rescanning
the field reports.

15:46.278 --> 15:47.545
You need to hear this, Chloe.

15:47.613 --> 15:49.280
Agent Beck just checked in
from the laundry.

15:49.348 --> 15:51.549
He said he's been locked down
for the past half hour,

15:51.617 --> 15:53.217
and only just now managed
to free himself.

15:53.285 --> 15:55.519
What? Apparently, Jack
didn't fall for the trap.

15:55.587 --> 15:58.189
Instead, he reversed the entire
squad and took Cole hostage.

15:58.257 --> 16:00.157
I just talked to Cole.

16:00.225 --> 16:01.859
Beck says Jack had him
at gunpoint.

16:01.927 --> 16:05.096
Devin, pull up the satellite
on the lower East Side.

16:05.163 --> 16:06.797
Address:
14633 12th Street.

16:06.865 --> 16:09.033
It's where the private
contractors are holding Dana.

16:09.101 --> 16:10.968
It's where
Jack's on his way to now.

16:11.036 --> 16:12.570
What is going on, Chloe?

16:12.638 --> 16:14.972
He's been two steps ahead of me
the whole time.

16:15.040 --> 16:17.675
He probably knew what I was
gonna do before I did.

16:17.743 --> 16:18.876
Hello, everybody!

16:18.944 --> 16:20.378
Can I have your attention,
please?

16:20.445 --> 16:22.747
Jack Bauer's no longer in
custody of CTU.

16:22.814 --> 16:25.650
Agent Cole Ortiz is with him,
most likely as a hostage.

16:25.717 --> 16:28.286
Our priority is
to find them now.

16:28.353 --> 16:30.187
Satellite's online,
Ms. O'Brian.

16:30.255 --> 16:31.389
Put it up.

16:34.226 --> 16:35.393
We're too late.

16:35.460 --> 16:38.095
Put the APB back out on Jack,
all agencies.

16:38.163 --> 16:40.264
Get me the White House.

16:42.134 --> 16:44.302
Where are we going?

16:44.369 --> 16:47.171
You tell me. You said
you had a video file

16:47.239 --> 16:48.739
implicating people inside
the Russian government

16:48.807 --> 16:50.308
who are responsible
for Renee's murder.

16:50.375 --> 16:51.809
I want that file.

16:51.877 --> 16:54.545
And I said I'd give it to you
in exchange for immunity.

16:54.613 --> 16:57.248
That deal's off the table.

16:57.316 --> 16:58.349
The president decided
the peace agreement's

16:58.417 --> 16:59.350
more important than the truth.

16:59.418 --> 17:00.685
As far as she's concerned,

17:00.752 --> 17:02.787
that file can never see
the light of day.

17:02.854 --> 17:04.521
But I still want it.

17:04.589 --> 17:05.923
What's the new deal?

17:05.991 --> 17:08.592
You give us the file,
we let you go.

17:08.660 --> 17:09.760
Go where, Riker's Island?

17:09.828 --> 17:11.729
Dana, you're a small fish
in all of this.

17:11.797 --> 17:13.698
I'm going after the people
who gave the orders.

17:13.765 --> 17:15.700
You give me the evidence,
we'll let you go.

17:15.767 --> 17:17.068
I give you my word.

17:17.135 --> 17:18.469
Your word?

17:18.537 --> 17:21.906
I'm sorry.
I don't believe you, Jack.

17:21.973 --> 17:23.808
Fine.

17:23.875 --> 17:25.542
You think this is a joke?

17:25.609 --> 17:27.478
We'll do it another way.

17:41.593 --> 17:43.594
Get out. Get out!

17:43.662 --> 17:44.962
Jack!

17:45.030 --> 17:47.131
Jack, Cole!

17:47.199 --> 17:48.632
Oh!

17:50.836 --> 17:52.403
Tell me where that
file is-- now!

17:52.471 --> 17:53.771
That file's the only thing

17:53.839 --> 17:55.139
keeping me alive!
No, right now

17:55.207 --> 17:56.841
I'm the only thing
keeping you alive.

17:56.908 --> 17:59.377
I'm gonna count backwards from three,
and then I'm gonna kill you.

17:59.444 --> 18:01.245
Three! You're really not
gonna let him shoot me

18:01.313 --> 18:02.380
in cold blood, are you, Cole?
Two!

18:02.447 --> 18:03.981
Jack!
Back off!

18:04.049 --> 18:06.584
One!
In a safety-deposit box!

18:06.651 --> 18:07.885
Where?

18:07.953 --> 18:09.086
First Unity Savings.
Cole knows.

18:09.154 --> 18:11.255
We have a joint account there.
But the box is in

18:11.323 --> 18:12.523
my name, which means I'm

18:12.591 --> 18:13.924
the only one who can access it.
Where's the bank?

18:13.992 --> 18:15.760
Lexington, off East 59th.

18:15.827 --> 18:17.661
I had nothing to do
with Renee's death, Jack.

18:17.729 --> 18:19.263
I didn't even know
she was a target.

18:19.331 --> 18:21.732
Put her in the car.
I was in a CTU holding cell!

18:21.800 --> 18:23.267
Put her back in the car!

18:23.335 --> 18:25.703
Damn it! You see what's
happening here, don't you?

18:25.771 --> 18:27.271
He's using you.
Using me? You're using me.

18:27.339 --> 18:29.240
What do you think he's gonna
do once I give him that file?

18:29.307 --> 18:31.142
He's gonna give the evidence
to the press

18:31.209 --> 18:32.276
and expose everyone responsible.

18:32.344 --> 18:33.411
Is that what you think?

18:33.478 --> 18:34.612
'Cause I doubt that's
what Jack thinks.

18:34.679 --> 18:36.047
He's gonna assemble
the evidence,

18:36.114 --> 18:38.249
make a list of the guilty,
and then he's gonna execute them

18:38.316 --> 18:39.583
one by one, starting with me.

18:41.686 --> 18:43.721
This isn't about the
truth, Cole.

18:43.789 --> 18:46.223
It's about revenge!
Cole!

18:47.225 --> 18:49.293
Look, I can't do this!

18:57.436 --> 18:59.570
She's just trying
to get inside your head.

18:59.638 --> 19:01.439
I know that, damn it!

19:02.774 --> 19:04.708
You got something
you want to say to me,

19:04.776 --> 19:06.243
you better say it now.

19:06.311 --> 19:09.346
Were you gonna pull
that trigger?

19:09.414 --> 19:12.083
I need her to think I would.

19:16.188 --> 19:17.655
Yeah, okay.

19:47.919 --> 19:49.487
Mrs. Hassan, please

19:49.554 --> 19:51.856
allow me to offer my condolences
for your loss.

19:51.923 --> 19:53.757
Your husband was a great man.

19:53.825 --> 19:54.892
Thank you.

19:54.960 --> 19:57.027
How has news of his death
been received

19:57.095 --> 19:58.329
back in the Islamic Republic?

19:58.396 --> 19:59.730
And do people there

19:59.798 --> 20:01.565
generally support your decision

20:01.633 --> 20:04.068
to take his place
as head of state?

20:04.136 --> 20:08.806
I'm confident that most
of my country is behind me.

20:08.874 --> 20:10.040
Those who aren't,

20:10.108 --> 20:12.209
probably never supported
my husband's policies

20:12.277 --> 20:13.410
in the first place.

20:13.478 --> 20:16.247
And what are your plans
after the treaty is signed?

20:16.314 --> 20:17.448
Right now, I'm concentrating

20:17.516 --> 20:19.350
all my efforts on the pursuit

20:19.417 --> 20:21.452
of finishing what
my husband started

20:21.520 --> 20:22.553
with this agreement.

20:22.621 --> 20:26.190
But I want to return
to Kamistan.

20:26.258 --> 20:27.224
Is this true?

20:27.292 --> 20:28.692
I'm afraid so, ma'am.

20:28.760 --> 20:30.895
The details are sketchy,
but as of 15 minutes ago,

20:30.962 --> 20:32.997
Jack Bauer stormed
the safe house,

20:33.064 --> 20:34.665
overwhelmed security
and took Dana Walsh.

20:34.733 --> 20:36.867
Do we have any idea
where they are?

20:36.935 --> 20:40.037
A hard target search
is under way.

20:40.105 --> 20:42.339
Your note also mentioned
Charles Logan.

20:42.407 --> 20:44.441
Yes, ma'am. He's been calling
and demanding

20:44.509 --> 20:46.243
to speak to you.
He insisted that I interrupt

20:46.311 --> 20:48.279
the press conference.

20:48.346 --> 20:50.214
All you'll have to do is
hit redial.

20:50.282 --> 20:52.449
Thank you, Tim.
Excuse me.

20:52.517 --> 20:53.951
Yes, ma'am.

20:57.189 --> 21:01.559
...the body be ritually washed
and draped...

21:01.626 --> 21:02.960
Hello?

21:03.028 --> 21:05.462
How in God's name could
this have happened?!

21:05.530 --> 21:09.433
Madam President, the important
thing is not to panic.

21:09.501 --> 21:12.036
You assured me that Dana Walsh
would be more secure

21:12.103 --> 21:14.738
in the hands
of your private contractors.

21:14.806 --> 21:17.575
We didn't move her out of CTU
solely for security reasons,

21:17.642 --> 21:20.010
as I'm sure you remember.

21:20.078 --> 21:21.946
Do you have me on speaker,
Charles?

21:22.013 --> 21:25.149
Pick up the damn phone.

21:25.217 --> 21:27.318
Forgive me, I wasn't thinking.

21:27.385 --> 21:29.753
Apparently, neither was I.

21:29.821 --> 21:31.222
It's a little late

21:31.289 --> 21:32.590
for buyer's remorse,
Madam President,

21:32.657 --> 21:37.928
especially because I was
calling with a solution

21:37.996 --> 21:40.831
to our current problem.

21:40.899 --> 21:41.966
Bauer may have Walsh,

21:42.033 --> 21:43.601
but he can't have
the evidence yet.

21:43.668 --> 21:45.236
We've still got a chance
to stop him.

21:45.303 --> 21:46.303
How?

21:46.371 --> 21:48.672
By putting somebody inside CTU,

21:48.740 --> 21:51.575
someone whose loyalties
aren't split,

21:51.643 --> 21:54.278
who won't hesitate
to see the mission through

21:54.346 --> 21:55.946
no matter what the cost.

21:56.014 --> 21:57.414
I've already replaced
one director.

21:57.482 --> 21:58.415
I can't replace another.

21:58.483 --> 21:59.717
No, not a new director.

21:59.784 --> 22:02.386
Just someone to supervise
the manhunt for Bauer.

22:02.454 --> 22:04.021
I'm recommending Jason Pillar.

22:04.089 --> 22:05.723
Your aide?

22:05.790 --> 22:07.758
He's Bureau-trained,
Madam President.

22:07.826 --> 22:09.660
He was second in command at DIA

22:09.728 --> 22:11.328
during the Daniels'
Administration

22:11.396 --> 22:13.664
and he made a name for
himself in Afghanistan,

22:13.732 --> 22:18.202
chasing high-value
targets behind enemy lines.

22:18.270 --> 22:21.338
Of course if you
have a better idea,

22:21.406 --> 22:23.140
I'll gladly take a step back.

22:23.208 --> 22:25.042
Madam President.
Just a second.

22:25.110 --> 22:27.177
What is it, Susan?
Mrs. Hassan is finishing up.

22:27.245 --> 22:28.279
I'm on my way.

22:32.284 --> 22:36.487
Look, I'll tell Tim Woods
that I support you

22:36.554 --> 22:37.821
making an operational change.

22:37.889 --> 22:40.891
But that's it, Charles--
no more excuses.

22:40.959 --> 22:42.293
Thank you, Madame President.

22:42.360 --> 22:43.994
And allow me to say that...

22:47.599 --> 22:49.833
No, I understand completely.

22:49.901 --> 22:53.170
And I appreciate
your confidence in Jason.

22:53.238 --> 22:55.606
How soon can you leave for CTU?

22:55.674 --> 22:56.940
Immediately.

22:57.008 --> 22:59.643
Good. I'll handle the
arrangements on this end.

23:21.966 --> 23:24.267
Congratulations, Charles.

23:24.335 --> 23:27.103
You have recast yourself
as the great peacemaker.

23:27.171 --> 23:29.272
I appreciate your help in
getting me this far, Mikhail.

23:29.340 --> 23:31.474
So tell me what I'm doing here?

23:36.814 --> 23:38.715
I had hoped to have this
conversation in private.

23:38.782 --> 23:42.018
This is my attachÃ©
Pavel Tokarev.

23:42.086 --> 23:43.953
You can speak freely.

23:44.021 --> 23:46.656
He is more than well
acquainted with the situation.

23:46.724 --> 23:49.359
Well...

23:53.697 --> 23:56.366
There's been
an unforeseen problem.

23:56.433 --> 23:59.369
Apparently I'm not the only one
who can prove that elements

23:59.436 --> 24:01.638
in your government conspired
to undermine the peace process.

24:01.705 --> 24:02.906
Meaning?

24:02.973 --> 24:04.440
Dana Walsh,

24:04.508 --> 24:07.076
the mole you installed
inside CTU,

24:07.144 --> 24:08.912
claims to have evidence
to that effect.

24:08.979 --> 24:10.146
Not possible.

24:10.214 --> 24:11.814
She was handled

24:11.882 --> 24:13.683
with complete deniability.

24:13.751 --> 24:15.618
So you say.

24:15.686 --> 24:18.121
But, no one in this room

24:18.189 --> 24:20.490
can take the chance
that she's bluffing.

24:20.558 --> 24:22.825
Now... I tried
to contain this.

24:22.893 --> 24:27.063
I had Ms. Walsh detained
and interrogated.

24:27.131 --> 24:29.999
The problem is, Jack Bauer
just broke her out.

24:30.067 --> 24:32.101
Apparently, he has

24:32.169 --> 24:33.670
a personal interest

24:33.737 --> 24:37.006
in exposing this evidence.

24:37.074 --> 24:38.841
Then you need to stop him.

24:38.909 --> 24:41.811
Surely President Taylor is
motivated to do the same.

24:41.879 --> 24:43.613
She is, to a point.

24:43.681 --> 24:45.215
But I know Bauer.

24:45.282 --> 24:48.952
And I can promise you he
will never let this go.

24:49.019 --> 24:51.387
And I don't think

24:51.455 --> 24:53.890
the president is
willing to do what is

24:53.958 --> 24:56.259
ultimately required.

24:56.327 --> 24:58.695
So you expect me
to kill Bauer for you?

24:58.762 --> 25:00.063
We both know

25:00.130 --> 25:03.566
you have the covert assets
here to do the job.

25:06.737 --> 25:08.371
Maybe I do--

25:08.439 --> 25:12.342
but I don't have the resources
to find him, track him.

25:12.409 --> 25:13.743
CTU does.

25:13.811 --> 25:17.880
And the man in charge of
the search now reports to me.

25:19.116 --> 25:21.851
How would this work?

25:24.788 --> 25:28.391
This is a closed-channel phone.

25:28.459 --> 25:30.560
It's impossible to intercept.

25:30.628 --> 25:33.096
My man at CTU will use
it to feed your people

25:33.163 --> 25:37.333
real-time information
as to Bauer's whereabouts.

25:37.401 --> 25:42.071
And they can put an end to this
problem, once and for all.

26:02.493 --> 26:04.694
We have to assume that CTU's
been getting my face out there.

26:04.762 --> 26:07.397
You're going to have to take
her into the bank on your own.

26:07.464 --> 26:08.765
I'll stand sentry in the lobby.

26:08.832 --> 26:10.300
How well do you know
the layout inside?

26:10.367 --> 26:11.301
Vault's in the back.

26:11.368 --> 26:12.669
Tellers are on one side
of the room,

26:12.736 --> 26:14.137
loan officers are on the other.

26:14.204 --> 26:16.005
One of them's an old buddy
of mine from high school.

26:16.073 --> 26:17.440
He was helping us
line up a mortgage.

26:17.508 --> 26:19.042
Okay, you keep her inside your
strike zone.

26:19.109 --> 26:21.277
If she sees an opportunity,
she's going to take it.

26:21.345 --> 26:22.879
You trust her for nothing,
you understand?

26:22.946 --> 26:24.414
I'll be fine, Jack.

26:24.481 --> 26:27.617
Okay, let's go.

26:27.685 --> 26:30.787
I know you hate me right now,
but I don't really believe

26:30.854 --> 26:32.255
you want to see me executed.

26:32.323 --> 26:33.723
Save it.

26:33.757 --> 26:37.060
We both saw how close he came to
pulling the trigger back there.

26:37.127 --> 26:38.828
That's just what he
wanted you to think.

26:38.896 --> 26:40.897
If that's what he
told you, he's lying.

26:40.964 --> 26:43.700
Just like he's lying about what
he's going to do with that file.

26:43.767 --> 26:46.235
Jack wants to bring the people
responsible for this to justice.

26:46.303 --> 26:48.805
Just like me. Who do you think
these people are, Cole?

26:48.872 --> 26:50.640
They're Russian diplomats
with full diplomatic immunity.

26:50.708 --> 26:52.208
They'll be indicted by
the World Court

26:52.276 --> 26:54.010
and hauled up in front
of the Hague.

26:54.078 --> 26:55.678
You really believe Jack Bauer

26:55.746 --> 26:57.347
wants to trust some toothless
international tribunal

26:57.414 --> 26:59.415
to mete out justice to
the people who killed Renee?

26:59.483 --> 27:00.483
Keep going.

27:00.551 --> 27:02.719
You're hurting me.
You'll live.

27:39.821 --> 27:42.690
Confirm all traffic camera feeds
are being ported through us.

27:42.757 --> 27:44.425
Up-res and route everything
through facial recognition.

27:44.493 --> 27:47.761
Parameter-matching on
Jack, Cole, or Dana.

27:47.829 --> 27:50.898
We don't have anywhere near the
bandwidth to do that citywide.

27:50.966 --> 27:54.368
Then job the overflow to NSA.

27:54.436 --> 27:57.238
Where are we on setting up
the search grid with NYPD?

27:57.305 --> 27:58.672
In process.

27:58.740 --> 28:00.474
They're giving us all
the personnel they can spare,

28:00.542 --> 28:01.709
But they're going
on record that,

28:01.776 --> 28:03.644
unless we narrow down
the search area,

28:03.712 --> 28:06.580
it's "needle in
a haystack" time.

28:08.283 --> 28:09.483
O'Brian.

28:09.551 --> 28:12.219
There's a Jason Pillar
on his way to see you.

28:12.287 --> 28:13.888
Pillar?
Yeah.

28:13.955 --> 28:15.890
Tim Wood's office
pre-cleared him.

28:15.957 --> 28:17.291
Send him up.

28:17.359 --> 28:19.760
He's already on his way.
He wouldn't wait.

28:19.828 --> 28:22.162
Never heard of this guy.
Who is he?

28:22.230 --> 28:23.497
He was second in command at DIA

28:23.565 --> 28:24.832
under the Daniel's
administration.

28:24.900 --> 28:27.268
He's been working
the private sector for years.

28:27.335 --> 28:30.971
Ms. O'Brian, Jason Pillar.

28:31.039 --> 28:33.073
This is my associate
Eden Linley.

28:33.141 --> 28:34.742
Okay.

28:34.809 --> 28:36.143
So why are you here?

28:36.211 --> 28:38.012
Frankly, the
White House is unhappy

28:38.079 --> 28:40.281
with the way the manhunt
for Jack Bauer's been handled.

28:40.348 --> 28:41.916
President Taylor's issued
an executive order

28:41.983 --> 28:44.018
placing me in charge
of the search from here on.

28:44.085 --> 28:46.353
What?! You'll retain your
position as acting director

28:46.421 --> 28:47.955
for the time being

28:48.023 --> 28:49.690
with authority over all
over CTU operations.

28:49.758 --> 28:51.959
Arlo, give us a minute?

28:52.027 --> 28:53.794
You got it.

28:54.930 --> 28:57.197
This doesn't make any sense.

28:57.265 --> 28:58.432
Excuse me?

28:58.500 --> 29:00.000
Why are you here?

29:00.068 --> 29:02.102
You have nothing to do
with Homeland Security anymore.

29:02.170 --> 29:03.871
Ms. O'Brian,
all you need to know

29:03.939 --> 29:05.606
is that I'm here under
the president's orders.

29:05.674 --> 29:06.874
Well, you're wasting your time.

29:06.942 --> 29:08.475
We've done everything
possible to find Jack.

29:08.543 --> 29:09.777
If that were true,

29:09.844 --> 29:11.712
then the trap you set
for Bauer would have worked.

29:11.780 --> 29:13.847
It's not that simple.
Instead, you were more concerned

29:13.915 --> 29:15.382
with making sure
he didn't get hurt.

29:15.450 --> 29:16.617
It's all in the hourlies.

29:16.685 --> 29:18.118
In fact, the last
operational command

29:18.186 --> 29:20.821
you sent to Agent Ortiz was,

29:20.889 --> 29:22.823
"Remember, non-lethal force."

29:22.891 --> 29:24.658
Not exactly the
appropriate sentiment

29:24.726 --> 29:27.695
when the president told you how
important it was that Bauer be stopped.

29:27.762 --> 29:29.196
The president doesn't want
Jack to be hurt.

29:29.264 --> 29:31.498
She knows what he'd done for
this country-- and so do you.

29:31.566 --> 29:34.735
What Bauer's doing will destroy
the peace agreement.

29:34.803 --> 29:37.605
And the president
cannot let that happen.

29:39.374 --> 29:41.809
It's time to take off
the kid gloves.

29:41.876 --> 29:44.478
We need all protocols
and encryption keys

29:44.546 --> 29:46.313
transferred to us immediately.

29:46.381 --> 29:49.183
As well as system overrides
and administrative privileges.

29:49.250 --> 29:50.718
Understood?

29:52.787 --> 29:54.221
Ms. O'Brian?

29:55.790 --> 29:58.959
Yeah, understood.

29:59.027 --> 30:01.895
Re-code the all-agency
bulletin on Bauer

30:01.963 --> 30:04.531
to "armed and dangerous"
level eight.

30:04.599 --> 30:08.435
And change the use of force
guidelines to "unrestricted."

30:28.957 --> 30:30.257
Here we go.

30:30.325 --> 30:31.558
Just make yourselves
comfortable.

30:31.626 --> 30:33.727
I'll be right back with
your safety deposit box.

30:33.795 --> 30:35.229
Thanks.
Thank you.

30:35.296 --> 30:37.798
Let's go.

30:45.907 --> 30:47.241
Something funny?

30:49.210 --> 30:52.880
This. You and me--
it's not the way

30:52.947 --> 30:54.848
that it was supposed
to turn out.

30:54.916 --> 30:57.785
I'm serious, Cole.

30:57.852 --> 31:02.122
Now that this is all over,
you deserve to hear the truth.

31:02.190 --> 31:05.125
It's a little late
for the truth.

31:05.193 --> 31:07.227
If you're even capable of it.

31:07.295 --> 31:09.430
You don't have to believe me.

31:09.497 --> 31:11.432
I was a kid.

31:11.499 --> 31:14.201
A kid with five years
of prison behind me

31:14.269 --> 31:15.903
and no future to speak of.

31:15.970 --> 31:19.106
A guy came to see me--
a Russian.

31:19.174 --> 31:23.744
Said that he could
give me a fresh start.

31:23.812 --> 31:27.214
I had absolutely no idea
what I was getting myself into.

31:27.282 --> 31:29.483
You could have come clean
anytime you wanted.

31:29.551 --> 31:32.619
And go back to jail.
Not a chance.

31:32.687 --> 31:35.889
Look, I know that
it's not an excuse,

31:35.957 --> 31:38.992
but ever since I met you
I have been trying

31:39.060 --> 31:42.563
to dig myself out
of this mess that I'm in.

31:42.630 --> 31:46.567
You're right--
I don't believe you.

31:46.634 --> 31:49.503
It's why I made that video file,
Cole.

31:49.571 --> 31:51.772
I was going to use it
as leverage

31:51.840 --> 31:53.874
to get the Russians
to leave us alone.

31:53.942 --> 31:55.008
Us?
Yes.

31:55.076 --> 31:57.010
There is no "us," Dana.

31:57.078 --> 31:59.680
There never was.

31:59.748 --> 32:02.316
It was a lie from the beginning.

32:02.383 --> 32:04.852
That is not true.

32:04.919 --> 32:07.354
Just stop playing me.
It's not going to work.

32:07.422 --> 32:09.423
I am not playing you.

32:09.491 --> 32:11.692
I loved you.

32:15.530 --> 32:18.999
Here we go-- 14-05.

32:19.067 --> 32:20.801
I'll be outside.

32:20.869 --> 32:22.836
Thank you, Brian.

32:28.109 --> 32:29.109
No.

32:39.387 --> 32:40.788
You never give up, do you?

32:48.496 --> 32:50.164
You guys all right?

32:50.231 --> 32:51.331
Hey, Cole...

33:43.651 --> 33:45.085
911. What is your emergency?

33:45.153 --> 33:47.387
Hi. I'm at First Unity

33:47.455 --> 33:48.889
Savings Bank on Lexington.

33:48.957 --> 33:50.557
There's a guy by the front door.

33:50.625 --> 33:52.726
I-I think I saw
him on the news.

33:52.794 --> 33:55.696
I think he has a gun.

33:55.763 --> 33:57.097
Oh, my God.

33:57.165 --> 33:58.465
He's looking in my direction.

33:58.533 --> 33:59.533
Oh, God!

34:24.511 --> 34:26.516
Great. As quickly
as you can.

34:26.516 --> 34:27.449
The 911 comm center

34:27.518 --> 34:28.784
just confirmed the call.

34:28.853 --> 34:30.620
Bauer was supposedly
I.D.'d by someone

34:30.688 --> 34:32.956
at the First Unity Savings
branch on Lexington.

34:33.023 --> 34:34.623
Supposedly?
What do you mean supposedly?

34:34.692 --> 34:35.958
It means all we have

34:36.025 --> 34:37.560
is the caller's word
that she recognized Jack

34:37.628 --> 34:38.661
from the news coverage.

34:38.728 --> 34:40.096
We don't have
secondary confirmation.

34:40.164 --> 34:42.031
Then get it for me.
Request access to

34:42.099 --> 34:43.766
the bank's video
surveillance system.

34:43.833 --> 34:45.301
I've already contacted them.

34:45.369 --> 34:46.603
I'm just trying to connect.

34:46.670 --> 34:48.737
Having trouble getting
the CTU comm protocols to work.

34:48.806 --> 34:49.906
You, what's your name?

34:49.974 --> 34:51.040
Devon Rosenthal.

34:51.108 --> 34:52.442
Help her.

34:52.510 --> 34:54.043
Don't look at O'Brian.

34:54.110 --> 34:55.344
I'm giving you the order.

34:55.411 --> 34:56.446
Just follow it.

34:56.514 --> 34:58.681
All right,
let's see what's going on.

34:58.749 --> 35:01.751
All right, this is the...

35:01.819 --> 35:02.752
Oh, good.

35:02.820 --> 35:04.187
Got it?

35:08.726 --> 35:09.759
Here we go.

35:09.827 --> 35:10.927
Full access to

35:10.995 --> 35:14.130
the bank's
video surveillance system.

35:28.412 --> 35:30.179
We got him.

35:30.247 --> 35:32.181
Call NYPD and make sure they
realize the priority here.

35:32.249 --> 35:33.583
And tell them I want to be

35:33.651 --> 35:35.251
looped in their
operation in real time.

35:35.319 --> 35:37.320
Got it.
Be right back.

35:48.265 --> 35:49.332
Yes?

35:49.400 --> 35:50.567
We found Bauer.

35:50.634 --> 35:51.601
He's at a bank.

35:51.669 --> 35:53.603
First Unity Savings
on Lexington.

35:53.671 --> 35:55.238
How do you know?

35:55.306 --> 35:58.374
A 911 call confirmed
by video surveillance.

36:00.077 --> 36:02.278
Then the police are
already on their way.

36:02.346 --> 36:03.279
Can't help that.

36:03.347 --> 36:04.581
But once they have Bauer,

36:04.648 --> 36:06.049
I'll find out
where they're holding him.

36:06.116 --> 36:07.750
You'll have to take him out
while he's in custody.

36:07.818 --> 36:09.819
I'll wait for your call.

36:14.892 --> 36:16.225
Brown jacket, freeze!
Police!

36:16.293 --> 36:17.226
Get your hands up!

36:17.294 --> 36:18.661
Get your hands up now!

36:18.729 --> 36:19.662
Hands up!

36:19.730 --> 36:21.497
On your knees.

36:21.565 --> 36:23.333
Get down on your knees.

36:23.400 --> 36:24.834
Put your hands
behind your head.

36:24.902 --> 36:26.369
Interlock your fingers,
thumbs out.

36:26.437 --> 36:27.704
Do not move.

36:30.808 --> 36:31.975
We got him.

36:35.813 --> 36:37.013
Take it easy.

36:37.081 --> 36:38.247
You got no chance.

36:38.315 --> 36:39.282
We got units coming in.

36:39.350 --> 36:40.383
Shut up!

36:40.451 --> 36:42.051
You know who I am?

36:43.287 --> 36:44.754
Do you know who I am?!

36:44.822 --> 36:46.055
Yes.

36:46.123 --> 36:47.523
I don't want
to kill your partner,

36:47.591 --> 36:48.992
but I will if I have to.

36:49.059 --> 36:50.493
So here's what we're gonna do:

36:50.561 --> 36:52.929
Slowly, you're gonna
put your gun down.

36:54.331 --> 36:56.666
Drop your weapon now!

36:58.702 --> 37:01.437
Kick it over to me.

37:04.541 --> 37:06.142
I'm sorry.

37:17.154 --> 37:18.287
Call an ambulance.

37:18.355 --> 37:19.422
Call an ambulance now.

37:19.490 --> 37:21.491
Tell them
two police officers are down.

40:02.152 --> 40:04.487
Don't you move!

40:06.223 --> 40:10.860
Slowly... turn around
and head back to me.

40:11.895 --> 40:14.030
Now!

40:19.636 --> 40:21.370
What happened to Cole?

40:21.438 --> 40:23.573
Did you kill him?

40:23.640 --> 40:26.909
I could never do that.

40:26.977 --> 40:30.112
Where's the evidence?

40:30.180 --> 40:31.614
It's in my pocket.

40:31.682 --> 40:33.349
Show me.

40:33.417 --> 40:35.351
Jack, we can make a deal.

40:35.419 --> 40:37.220
Show me!

40:45.662 --> 40:49.465
I want you to slowly
put it down on the floor.

41:07.951 --> 41:10.119
Jack...

41:12.422 --> 41:15.157
Tell me what I can do.

41:20.297 --> 41:21.797
Nothing.

41:23.800 --> 41:25.067
Nothing.
