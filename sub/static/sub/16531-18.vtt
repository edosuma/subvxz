00:01.369 --> 00:03.537
ANNOUNCER: Thanks for
downloading this Fox show.

00:03.571 --> 00:05.739
And don't miss
all-new episodes on Fox.

00:07.941 --> 00:10.144
Previously on Empire...
Loretha.

00:10.178 --> 00:11.645
Barry...
Come to get my girl.

00:11.679 --> 00:13.847
Just so we're clear,
she's mine.

00:13.881 --> 00:16.184
JAMAL: I decided to hold off
on the release of
When Cookie Met Lucious.

00:16.217 --> 00:17.585
I'm gonna join
Dad's show in Vegas.

00:17.618 --> 00:19.553
COOKIE:
Giuliana is a cancer,

00:19.587 --> 00:22.523
and if we don't root
that bitch out, we all die.

00:22.556 --> 00:24.358
ANDRE: Charlotte is deadly
serious about

00:24.392 --> 00:25.993
keeping the thug element
out of Vegas.

00:26.026 --> 00:27.828
We'll just have to give her

00:27.861 --> 00:30.564
Biggie and 'Pac times ten.

00:30.598 --> 00:32.833
Mama, what did you do?
They ruined one of mine,

00:32.866 --> 00:34.868
so I took one of theirs.

00:34.902 --> 00:37.571
Wait till you find out
where I found Bella.

00:40.908 --> 00:42.910
*

00:47.248 --> 00:48.782
* Players *

00:48.816 --> 00:51.819
* Put yo' pinky rings
up to the moon *

00:53.587 --> 00:56.490
* Girls, what y'all
tryin' to do? *

00:57.758 --> 00:59.593
* 24-karat magic *

00:59.627 --> 01:03.697
* In the air *

01:03.731 --> 01:05.633
* Head to toe, so, player *

01:05.666 --> 01:06.667
* Uh, look out! *

01:08.602 --> 01:10.371
* Pop pop, it's show time *
* Show time

01:10.404 --> 01:11.472
* Show time *
* Show time

01:11.505 --> 01:13.641
* Guess who's back again *

01:13.674 --> 01:15.709
* Oh, they don't know? *
* Go on, tell 'em

01:15.743 --> 01:17.645
* I bet they know soon
as we walk in *
* Showin' up

01:17.678 --> 01:19.113
* Wearing Cuban links *
* Yeah

01:19.147 --> 01:21.081
* Designer minks *
* Yeah

01:21.115 --> 01:22.916
* Inglewood's finest shoes *
* Whoop, whoop

01:22.950 --> 01:24.652
* Don't look too hard
might hurt ya'self *

01:24.685 --> 01:26.387
* Known to give the color red
the blues *

01:26.420 --> 01:28.322
Welcome to Vegas,
big-daddy style.

01:28.356 --> 01:29.323
(shrieks)

01:29.357 --> 01:31.459
Welcome to Vegas, baby!

01:31.492 --> 01:33.161
Hey, put my mama
on the phone.

01:33.194 --> 01:35.696
Yes, sir.
(clears throat)

01:36.864 --> 01:37.931
(toilet flushes)

01:37.965 --> 01:38.966
It's Mr. Lyon.

01:40.934 --> 01:43.604
Dwight? How long
do you plan on

01:43.637 --> 01:45.439
keeping me cooped up
in here?

01:45.473 --> 01:47.741
You're gonna stay in there
until you're no longer

01:47.775 --> 01:49.677
having this episode
you're having.

01:49.710 --> 01:51.312
I'm not having an episode.

01:51.345 --> 01:54.182
I put steel in the skull
of your enemy.

01:54.215 --> 01:56.450
You know what, I don't know
what you're talking about,

01:56.484 --> 01:58.319
and I'm sure
you don't either.

01:58.352 --> 01:59.987
Take your medication.

02:00.020 --> 02:02.623
Juanita will tell me
when you're under control.

02:02.656 --> 02:04.225
(scoffs)

02:06.059 --> 02:07.761
Thank you.

02:07.795 --> 02:11.299
You know, it's not sanitary
to keep that in here.

02:29.583 --> 02:32.052
JAMAL: Oh, my goodness, Ma, you
just need to, like, cut it.

02:32.085 --> 02:33.354
You know what I'm saying?
You know why I'm doing it.

02:33.387 --> 02:36.156
Mm-mm, I can't.

02:36.190 --> 02:40.328
Shoot, maybe because
your devilish father

02:40.361 --> 02:42.863
tricked you into pulling
When Cookie Met Lucious

02:42.896 --> 02:44.698
so Inferno could get ahead.

02:44.732 --> 02:46.567
Ma, it's not some sort
of conspiracy.

02:46.600 --> 02:49.136
If I do Inferno, then that'll
get the fans excited

02:49.169 --> 02:51.071
for When Cookie Met Lucious
actually drops.

02:51.104 --> 02:53.474
Dad knows that, I know that,
you should know that, too.

02:53.507 --> 02:55.509
What does Giuliana have
to say, huh?

02:55.543 --> 02:57.010
Who...
Did she put her two cents in?

02:57.044 --> 02:58.512
You know this is
all her idea.

02:58.546 --> 02:59.913
Once she gets rid of me,

02:59.947 --> 03:01.048
she coming after you
and your brothers.

03:01.081 --> 03:02.650
Trust me on that.
Oh, my Lord.

03:02.683 --> 03:04.318
Ma, first of all I don't
deal with that woman.

03:04.352 --> 03:06.520
Second of all, she has
no sort of power

03:06.554 --> 03:07.821
to get rid of you.

03:07.855 --> 03:10.724
You Cookie Lyon, Ma.
Like, come on.

03:10.758 --> 03:12.360
Just come to the show.

03:12.393 --> 03:15.062
I can't, the bitch
had me black-booked.

03:15.095 --> 03:18.198
Yeah, If I go anywhere near
Laviticus Vegas... (chuckles)

03:18.232 --> 03:19.733
the cameras will
recognize my face

03:19.767 --> 03:21.835
and set off the alarms--
ain't that some bull?

03:21.869 --> 03:23.070
Yeah, that is some bull.

03:23.103 --> 03:25.539
Look, you ain't got to worry
about that, all right?

03:25.573 --> 03:29.042
I'll talk to Dad.
Just come to the show.

03:29.076 --> 03:30.444
Yeah, you do that.

03:30.478 --> 03:32.513
I'm only coming to see
you perform, anyway.

03:32.546 --> 03:34.214
That's the only reason
you should be coming.

03:34.248 --> 03:35.616
(both laugh)

03:37.117 --> 03:38.786
You think you could also

03:38.819 --> 03:40.754
get Hakeem to come, you
know what I'm saying?

03:40.788 --> 03:42.790
He don't need to be
by himself here and...

03:42.823 --> 03:45.092
I mean, we tried to convince him
to come be in the show, but...

03:45.125 --> 03:47.761
His head ain't been in the game
since Bella went missing.

03:47.795 --> 03:50.931
Don't you worry about that,
though, I will take care of him.

03:50.964 --> 03:52.366
I'm not gonna leave him
by hisself, you know that.

03:52.400 --> 03:54.201
I know.

03:54.234 --> 03:58.071
* Get it back to the Tri-State *

03:58.105 --> 04:00.073
* That's the rocket launcher
or that golden Smithen *

04:00.107 --> 04:01.775
* Smith and Wesson, it'll
eject ya, golden hit ya... *

04:01.809 --> 04:03.043
Nothing works, so I'm gonna
try it my way.

04:03.076 --> 04:05.379
Get off the phone!

04:05.413 --> 04:06.747
You're not gonna
find Bella by

04:06.780 --> 04:08.048
releasing a bunch of
idiots on the street.

04:08.081 --> 04:11.218
Whoa. Who you calling
an idiot?

04:11.251 --> 04:13.721
Right. We the new wave, mama.
This is how we do.

04:13.754 --> 04:15.255
This is reckless.

04:15.289 --> 04:16.724
Okay, Hakeem, you guys
have already completely

04:16.757 --> 04:18.692
vandalized the DuBois...
I don't care!

04:20.994 --> 04:21.962
(phone ringing,
Anika sighs)

04:21.995 --> 04:24.164
Give me a second.

04:24.197 --> 04:25.599
Let's go, people

04:25.633 --> 04:26.734
Hello?

04:26.767 --> 04:28.235
Oh, hello, dear.

04:28.268 --> 04:30.070
It's your soon-to-be
ex-mother-in-law.

04:30.103 --> 04:31.104
ANIKA:
What do you want?

04:31.138 --> 04:32.340
I want you to come

04:32.373 --> 04:34.408
and get rid of your
things, Boo Boo.

04:34.442 --> 04:36.510
I don't want to be reminded
you ever existed.

04:36.544 --> 04:38.178
Besides,

04:38.211 --> 04:39.647
you have a whole pile of mail.

04:39.680 --> 04:40.648
Unless you want me
to start opening it.

04:40.681 --> 04:41.915
Don't touch it.

04:41.949 --> 04:43.283
I will be back
as soon as I can.

04:43.317 --> 04:45.553
All righty.
I'll be expecting you.

04:48.722 --> 04:50.090
Turn it around.

04:50.123 --> 04:52.593
(Anika sighs)

04:52.626 --> 04:55.629
Look, Hakeem, listen.

04:55.663 --> 04:57.431
I know that you're
worried, I'm worried, too.

04:57.465 --> 05:01.535
But don't be crazy, like your
grandmother, all right?

05:01.569 --> 05:03.471
I know that
Bella's all right.

05:03.504 --> 05:04.605
I can...

05:04.638 --> 05:06.507
I can feel it.

05:06.540 --> 05:07.875
Trust me.

05:19.387 --> 05:21.889
* How lucky can one guy be? *

05:21.922 --> 05:24.658
* I kissed her
and she kissed me... *

05:24.692 --> 05:27.495
CHARLOTTE:
Wow, the venue is amazing.

05:27.528 --> 05:31.164
I can't wait to see Inferno
light up this space.

05:31.198 --> 05:33.901
Now, there is one thing
I'd like to share

05:33.934 --> 05:35.335
with both of you.

05:35.369 --> 05:39.707
September 7, 1996.

05:39.740 --> 05:42.976
Yes. That would be the
day that Tupac was shot.

05:43.010 --> 05:44.678
You know your
Vegas history.

05:44.712 --> 05:45.846
Well, actually, Charlotte,

05:45.879 --> 05:47.748
she knows her
hip-hop history.

05:47.781 --> 05:49.850
Well, that's semantics.

05:49.883 --> 05:53.153
In any case, earlier
that evening,

05:53.186 --> 05:55.222
Mr. Shakur and
Mr. Suge Knight

05:55.255 --> 05:57.825
and a gang of their
gangster friends

05:57.858 --> 05:59.893
stomped out their
rival in the lobby

05:59.927 --> 06:01.328
of the MGM Grand.

06:01.361 --> 06:04.898
My father was gaming
commissioner back then,

06:04.932 --> 06:07.868
and he lost his job
because of those vile thugs.

06:07.901 --> 06:10.538
If there's any ruckus

06:10.571 --> 06:13.106
on the opening night
of Inferno,

06:13.140 --> 06:15.876
it'll be the last time Empire
sets foot on the Strip.

06:20.113 --> 06:23.250
Hmm...
Hmm, she told you.

06:23.283 --> 06:24.217
She told you.

06:24.251 --> 06:26.219
(both laugh)

06:28.922 --> 06:32.359
ANDRE: I ran the plan
by Cookie, she's on board.

06:32.392 --> 06:33.861
When the show starts,
ten of our people

06:33.894 --> 06:35.729
will be positioned
inside the theater.

06:35.763 --> 06:38.098
We count down, another ten or
12 will bust through the door,

06:38.131 --> 06:39.232
and all hell breaks loose.

06:39.266 --> 06:41.268
Cookie said no fireworks,

06:41.301 --> 06:42.770
just boots and bats.

06:42.803 --> 06:45.272
She's just worried about
Jamal and his PTSD.

06:45.305 --> 06:46.974
Whatever. If I can
live through bipolar,

06:47.007 --> 06:49.042
he can live through this.

06:49.076 --> 06:50.711
When it's all said and
done, we'll be positioned

06:50.744 --> 06:52.946
to take over the lease
and start our own

06:52.980 --> 06:55.549
independent venture in Vegas.

06:55.583 --> 06:57.485
You tell Cookie about
the final piece of the plan?

06:57.518 --> 07:00.220
Hell no. No matter
what he does to her,

07:00.253 --> 07:02.790
she'll always be
in love with him.

07:02.823 --> 07:05.092
You really hate him, huh?

07:05.125 --> 07:06.326
(Andre chuckles)

07:06.359 --> 07:07.461
SHINE:
What'd he do to you?

07:08.962 --> 07:10.998
Everything.

07:11.031 --> 07:13.166
More than you could
ever imagine.

07:15.035 --> 07:18.305
I'm the only one that knows
what he truly is.

07:18.338 --> 07:19.940
That's why I got to kill him.

07:21.709 --> 07:23.744
You sure?

07:23.777 --> 07:26.179
Positive.

07:32.185 --> 07:33.954
Andre, this is Franco.

07:33.987 --> 07:35.322
He's the best there is

07:35.355 --> 07:36.857
at blowing stuff up.
Really?

07:36.890 --> 07:38.025
How come I never heard of him?

07:38.058 --> 07:39.927
You aren't supposed to hear

07:39.960 --> 07:42.129
about guys like me,
if we do our jobs right.

07:42.162 --> 07:43.430
All right,
here's the deal.

07:43.463 --> 07:44.698
While the pre-show's
getting started.

07:44.732 --> 07:46.767
Franco gets everything
ready outside.

07:46.800 --> 07:48.802
Soon as we start brawling,

07:48.836 --> 07:50.638
Lucious' security will rush him
out the back entrance,

07:50.671 --> 07:52.139
trying to protect
his ass.

07:52.172 --> 07:53.641
That's when we get him.

07:53.674 --> 07:55.543
It's remotely triggered
by this phone app,

07:55.576 --> 07:58.445
so, at the push
of a button...

07:58.478 --> 08:00.180
boom.

08:00.213 --> 08:03.651
Just like that.
Boom.

08:09.222 --> 08:11.024
I'm not going to Vegas
until I find Bella.

08:11.058 --> 08:12.560
Listen, son,
I've got it

08:12.593 --> 08:14.995
on great authority
that Bella's all right.

08:15.028 --> 08:16.029
What authority?

08:18.431 --> 08:21.334
I can't go into details
right now,

08:21.368 --> 08:23.804
but I was this close
to finding her,

08:23.837 --> 08:27.307
and then something...

08:27.340 --> 08:28.241
came up.

08:28.275 --> 08:29.242
But I haven't given up

08:29.276 --> 08:30.678
my search for her, son.

08:30.711 --> 08:31.879
Well, Grandma thinks you lyin'.

08:31.912 --> 08:34.081
No, no, don't even ever

08:34.114 --> 08:36.984
listen to anything
that your grandmother says.

08:37.017 --> 08:38.919
She is out of her
freakin' mind.

08:38.952 --> 08:40.754
Look, baby, I'm not gonna
go to Vegas

08:40.788 --> 08:42.089
if you don't go, okay?

08:42.122 --> 08:43.824
I would never leave you alone.

08:43.857 --> 08:45.325
Well, what about Anika, Ma?

08:45.358 --> 08:46.326
LUCIOUS:
Don't worry about Anika.

08:46.359 --> 08:47.928
Anika got her own mama,

08:47.961 --> 08:49.563
she's got her own daddy
to look after her.

08:49.597 --> 08:51.765
Yeah.
You worry about you.

08:51.799 --> 08:53.433
Look at this place right now.

08:53.466 --> 08:55.836
Why is she acting so calm?

08:55.869 --> 08:57.838
Like she don't even care
about Bella no more.

08:57.871 --> 09:00.407
Well, baby, women have
a certain strength

09:00.440 --> 09:02.042
when it comes to when
it comes to stuff like that.

09:02.075 --> 09:04.077
We have to stay calm,

09:04.111 --> 09:07.114
even when we don't want to,
for the sake of our children.

09:08.716 --> 09:10.450
Listen to your mama.

09:12.452 --> 09:14.788
She's very wise.

09:16.323 --> 09:19.059
But you need to take
care of you right now.
Mm-hmm.

09:27.434 --> 09:29.637
Oh, don't feel the need
to hide your joy.

09:29.670 --> 09:31.104
I'm just as happy as you

09:31.138 --> 09:34.908
to be leaving
this... hellhole and you.

09:34.942 --> 09:37.144
I'm not hiding anything.

09:37.177 --> 09:40.080
I've been dancing around
in my skivvies for days.

09:40.113 --> 09:42.282
Hmph.

09:42.315 --> 09:43.851
Why do you need those?

09:45.986 --> 09:49.456
Oh, I just figured
that maybe Lucious

09:49.489 --> 09:51.625
might want me to
take everything with me.

09:51.659 --> 09:54.261
Hmm.
Your mail.

09:54.294 --> 09:56.630
Oh, yes.

09:56.664 --> 09:58.699
Don't forget to tell
the post office you moved.

10:00.300 --> 10:03.971
I think the big one is
from your divorce lawyer.

10:04.004 --> 10:06.874
Oh, yes!
Finally.

10:10.811 --> 10:12.746
Oh, careful.

10:12.780 --> 10:14.314
You don't want to rip it,

10:14.347 --> 10:16.016
in case it's a check,
or something.

10:16.049 --> 10:18.118
Why don't you use
the letter opener?

10:27.560 --> 10:29.362
(sighs)

10:29.396 --> 10:31.965
(chuckling)

10:34.902 --> 10:36.937
Bitch.

10:36.970 --> 10:38.672
(sighs)

10:41.875 --> 10:44.211
As head of the Nevada
Gaming Commission,

10:44.244 --> 10:47.280
it is my honor to welcome
Laviticus Resort and Casino

10:47.314 --> 10:48.882
to the Las Vegas Strip.

10:48.916 --> 10:50.818
I and the NGC have been working

10:50.851 --> 10:52.485
very closely
with Lucious Lyon

10:52.519 --> 10:55.322
to ensure that Laviticus
will provide safe,

10:55.355 --> 10:57.891
enjoyable, family-friendly
entertainment

10:57.925 --> 10:59.893
to our great city.

10:59.927 --> 11:03.063
We hope that Inferno will be
Vegas's next big sensation.

11:03.096 --> 11:04.664
Thank you.
(reporters clamoring)

11:04.698 --> 11:06.166
If you have any questions,

11:06.199 --> 11:07.500
refer to the press release.

11:10.237 --> 11:13.907
Honey, why don't you, uh, go to
the car and get the kids ready?

11:13.941 --> 11:15.508
ANDRE:
Commissioner Frost.

11:15.542 --> 11:16.576
Nice to see you again.

11:16.609 --> 11:18.311
Andre, good to see you.

11:18.345 --> 11:19.512
This is my husband.

11:19.546 --> 11:20.714
Mitt Frost.
Good to meet you.

11:20.748 --> 11:22.549
Andre Lyon. Pleasure.

11:22.582 --> 11:25.819
I wasn't expecting to see you
until later in the week.

11:25.853 --> 11:27.520
I came early
in case I'm needed.

11:27.554 --> 11:31.091
Once I hammer out a deal,
I like to stay on top of it.

11:32.525 --> 11:34.394
Know what I mean, Mitt?

11:34.427 --> 11:35.863
Yes, speaking of which,

11:35.896 --> 11:37.831
we should continue
the conversation

11:37.865 --> 11:39.599
we started in my office.

11:39.632 --> 11:40.868
It's just, right now,

11:40.901 --> 11:41.935
we have to go.

11:41.969 --> 11:42.936
Our son Brigham

11:42.970 --> 11:44.004
has a soccer game.

11:44.037 --> 11:45.739
Understood.

11:45.773 --> 11:47.941
Well, pleasure
to meet you, Mitt.
You as well.

11:47.975 --> 11:49.242
Charlotte.

11:49.276 --> 11:50.277
Andre.

11:55.816 --> 11:59.019
This is the official
gaming license,

11:59.052 --> 12:01.288
we are no longer in probation.

12:03.056 --> 12:05.225
(whoops)

12:05.258 --> 12:06.693
Yeah.

12:06.726 --> 12:08.561
You kept your promise.

12:08.595 --> 12:09.696
Is this everything?

12:09.729 --> 12:10.931
Yeah. Well, I just have

12:10.964 --> 12:12.732
a couple more
signatures, and...

12:12.766 --> 12:14.734
Excuse me for a second.

12:14.768 --> 12:16.770
Of course.

12:18.738 --> 12:20.974
COOKIE: I don't even have it.
Send me the...

12:21.008 --> 12:22.475
LUCIOUS:
Excuse me.

12:22.509 --> 12:24.912
Cook.

12:24.945 --> 12:27.881
Look, um...

12:27.915 --> 12:30.083
I got you invited
to the opening of Inferno.

12:30.117 --> 12:31.785
Oh. Thought I was black-booked.

12:31.819 --> 12:33.486
I pulled some strings.

12:33.520 --> 12:36.323
I'm-a have you sit
in the V.I.P. section with Dre

12:36.356 --> 12:38.058
and Hakeem.

12:38.091 --> 12:39.459
He needs you.

12:39.492 --> 12:41.795
He needs both of us
right now, 'cause...

12:41.829 --> 12:44.664
I don't know if we're gonna find
that little girl.

12:48.201 --> 12:49.736
I can't have you
backstage though.

12:49.769 --> 12:51.271
Bitch's rules?

12:51.304 --> 12:52.505
Look, I just don't want
any trouble, Cook,

12:52.539 --> 12:54.474
this is a big move
for the company.

12:54.507 --> 12:56.243
I mean, we're thinking
about franchising

12:56.276 --> 12:59.112
Laviticus clubs
all around the world,

12:59.146 --> 13:01.514
so I'm talking about
a global Empire.

13:01.548 --> 13:04.717
Right. So who gonna sit
on the throne with you?

13:10.657 --> 13:12.792
Get out of my face, Lucious.

13:27.140 --> 13:30.643
* She make that thang go drip
drop, drip drippity drop... *

13:30.677 --> 13:32.946
Hey.

13:32.980 --> 13:35.883
Hey, boo.
I know exactly who
you should date next.

13:35.916 --> 13:37.450
It needs to be, like,
a dope-ass businessman,

13:37.484 --> 13:39.019
not, like, an artist.

13:39.052 --> 13:40.854
Like, we're both done
with artists forever.

13:40.888 --> 13:43.490
Nah, I'm done with the dudes
for a minute. Come on.

13:43.523 --> 13:45.225
So there's a chance
for you and me, then?

13:45.258 --> 13:47.327
Hey...
(both laugh)
EMCEE: What's up, y'all?

13:47.360 --> 13:49.129
Welcome to open mic night
at Laviticus New York!

13:49.162 --> 13:51.464
(crowd cheering)

13:51.498 --> 13:54.567
Oh, up first, we got a fine
brother by the name

13:54.601 --> 13:56.904
of Warren Hall,
let's bring him out!

13:56.937 --> 13:59.907
(whooping, applause)

14:02.042 --> 14:04.044
Sorry, I'm a little bit nervous,
but thanks for having me.

14:04.077 --> 14:05.845
In my other life,

14:05.879 --> 14:07.814
I'm a buttoned-up lawyer, so...

14:07.847 --> 14:09.682
I'm not used
to all these cool people.

14:09.716 --> 14:10.918
(laughter)

14:10.951 --> 14:12.652
And frankly, if I had known

14:12.685 --> 14:14.487
Jamal Lyon was gonna be here,

14:14.521 --> 14:17.690
I probably wouldn't have signed
up to sing "Born to Love U."

14:17.724 --> 14:19.092
Eh, you good, man.

14:19.126 --> 14:21.094
It's like trying
to carve the David

14:21.128 --> 14:23.396
when you got Michelangelo
sitting here watching you.

14:23.430 --> 14:24.564
(whooping)

14:24.597 --> 14:25.565
Okay, you the David

14:25.598 --> 14:26.566
and the Michelangelo, okay?

14:26.599 --> 14:28.368
(laughs)

14:28.401 --> 14:29.602
(piano begins playing)

14:31.704 --> 14:33.873
* Hmm *

14:35.775 --> 14:37.777
* Mmm *

14:41.281 --> 14:44.284
* Here we go again,
here we go again *

14:44.317 --> 14:47.454
* Fire and emotion, ooh *

14:47.487 --> 14:50.924
* All up in your face,
about to walk away *

14:50.958 --> 14:54.727
* Both our hearts
are broken, ooh *

14:54.761 --> 14:58.198
* But the moment you're gone
all my colors fade *

14:58.231 --> 15:02.469
* Them bullets and balls
start to ricochet, oh *

15:02.502 --> 15:07.740
* I'm defenseless,
you leave me blown away *

15:07.774 --> 15:12.745
* I was born to love you *

15:12.779 --> 15:15.215
* And nobody else will do *

15:15.248 --> 15:19.419
* I would rather die
than live without you *

15:19.452 --> 15:22.389
* And everybody know it too *

15:22.422 --> 15:25.658
* Don't know why we go to war *

15:25.692 --> 15:28.761
* But the one thing
that's for sure *

15:28.795 --> 15:33.300
* I was born to love you *

15:33.333 --> 15:35.602
* And no, I... *

15:35.635 --> 15:37.971
WOMAN:
Ow! Okay!

15:38.005 --> 15:39.306
(cheering)

15:39.339 --> 15:41.641
(applause)

15:41.674 --> 15:45.112
* I was born to love you *

15:45.145 --> 15:46.779
WOMAN 2:
Yeah! That's right!

15:47.947 --> 15:52.652
* I was born to love you. *

15:54.787 --> 15:56.689
(doorbell rings)

15:56.723 --> 15:57.924
(door opens, closes)

15:57.957 --> 16:00.027
Hello, dear.

16:00.060 --> 16:02.462
Lisel is just getting
her ready for you.

16:02.495 --> 16:03.696
(ringing bell)

16:09.969 --> 16:12.339
Oh.

16:12.372 --> 16:14.774
HAKEEM (in distance):
Call the police, then!

16:14.807 --> 16:16.209
I don't care!
Get the baby out of here.

16:16.243 --> 16:19.846
I don't care, call the police!

16:19.879 --> 16:21.048
Get off me, man.

16:21.081 --> 16:22.515
I'm sorry, Mrs. Dubois,

16:22.549 --> 16:24.184
he pushed past me.
It's quite all right.

16:24.217 --> 16:26.019
I knew it.
Hakeem, what are you doing here?

16:26.053 --> 16:27.887
I followed you. My
grandma might be crazy,

16:27.920 --> 16:29.389
but she ain't stupid.

16:29.422 --> 16:30.690
She told me you were sketchy.

16:30.723 --> 16:32.292
Relax. Easy, son.

16:32.325 --> 16:33.226
I ain't your son.

16:33.260 --> 16:34.327
Thank God my mom

16:34.361 --> 16:35.428
didn't marry yo ass.

16:37.164 --> 16:39.266
Now, does these people
have my daughter?

16:40.733 --> 16:42.835
We know where she is.

16:42.869 --> 16:43.836
Where is she?

16:43.870 --> 16:46.506
She's safe and sound.

16:47.774 --> 16:49.842
Tell me right now.

16:56.349 --> 17:00.987
Look, I just want
to see her again.

17:01.020 --> 17:03.223
I'll do anything.

17:05.725 --> 17:06.859
Well.

17:06.893 --> 17:08.361
(laughs)

17:08.395 --> 17:11.364
You heard him,
he said he'd do anything.

17:12.899 --> 17:14.901
I'm gonna choose to believe him.

17:30.817 --> 17:32.285
I missed you.

17:32.319 --> 17:34.287
DIANA: We are
very happy

17:34.321 --> 17:36.689
to reunite you
with your daughter.

17:36.723 --> 17:38.925
But it comes at a price.

17:38.958 --> 17:43.630
First, you will reassure your
family that Bella is just fine.

17:43.663 --> 17:46.699
Social Services found her, she's
safely back with her mother,

17:46.733 --> 17:48.067
and then, you will wait

17:48.101 --> 17:52.139
to hear from us
what we require you to do next.

18:01.481 --> 18:04.651
ANNOUNCER:
It's... time!

18:04.684 --> 18:10.056
Time for the all-new Laviticus
Resort and Casino

18:10.089 --> 18:11.891
on the world-famous
Las Vegas Strip,

18:11.924 --> 18:16.763
Lucious Lyon's Inferno!

18:16.796 --> 18:18.965
* Everybody start to sing *

18:18.998 --> 18:20.833
* Everybody
start to sing *

18:20.867 --> 18:22.935
(scatting)

18:22.969 --> 18:25.305
* Now you're singing
with a swing *

18:25.338 --> 18:26.573
* Sing, sing, sing, sing *

18:26.606 --> 18:28.975
* Everybody start to sing... *

18:29.008 --> 18:30.943
All right, you better get back
to your family.

18:30.977 --> 18:32.812
I saw Mitt in the lobby buying
T-shirts for the kids.

18:32.845 --> 18:34.981
Well, then, we have
plenty of time.

18:35.014 --> 18:36.983
Mitt's indecisive.

18:37.016 --> 18:40.953
Plus, I want to tie up all
of these loose ends on our deal.

18:40.987 --> 18:42.955
You mean these loose ends?
Mm-hmm.

18:42.989 --> 18:45.091
Yeah.

18:45.124 --> 18:47.460
Damn, you make me crazy.

18:47.494 --> 18:49.162
Every time I watch
that video I made of us...

18:52.565 --> 18:54.434
You made a video?

18:54.467 --> 18:57.604
My favorite part's
where you yank off my belt,

18:57.637 --> 18:58.971
moaning you can't wait

18:59.005 --> 19:00.973
to see if what they say
about black men...

19:02.008 --> 19:03.343
Mmm.

19:03.376 --> 19:04.877
You're extorting me.

19:04.911 --> 19:06.646
That's a harsh word.

19:06.679 --> 19:09.216
I think I like
gentle persuasion better.

19:12.719 --> 19:15.622
I bet Mitt's made up
his mind by now.

19:15.655 --> 19:18.525
Hope you and your
family enjoy the show.

19:18.558 --> 19:20.260
Good-bye, Mrs. Frost.

19:24.163 --> 19:25.798
(exhales)

19:25.832 --> 19:26.999
* If you feelin'... *

19:27.033 --> 19:28.468
Good looking out, Pablo.

19:28.501 --> 19:29.836
I got you.

19:29.869 --> 19:31.571
Mm-hmm.
Hey, how you doing?

19:31.604 --> 19:32.639
* It's that time *

19:32.672 --> 19:34.707
* Shake that now,
shake that now *

19:34.741 --> 19:36.809
* If you feelin',
if you feelin' *

19:36.843 --> 19:38.578
* Like I'm feelin',
like I'm feelin' *

19:38.611 --> 19:40.046
(sniffles)

19:40.079 --> 19:41.080
* It's that time *

19:41.113 --> 19:42.715
* Shake that now,
shake that now *

19:42.749 --> 19:44.751
* Don't fight the grinnin'... *

19:44.784 --> 19:46.353
(phone rings)
Cookie.

19:46.386 --> 19:47.720
You understand me when I say

19:47.754 --> 19:48.988
take care of my family, right?

19:49.021 --> 19:50.357
Absolutely.

19:51.391 --> 19:53.192
You know what time it is.

19:53.226 --> 19:55.528
Watch for the signal.

19:55.562 --> 19:57.564
*

20:04.871 --> 20:06.773
I knew I would catch you
back here.

20:06.806 --> 20:08.207
What are you up to?

20:08.241 --> 20:09.776
I'm just coming
to wish Jamal good luck,

20:09.809 --> 20:11.043
like any good mother.

20:11.077 --> 20:12.412
LUCIOUS:
That's why you're here?

20:12.445 --> 20:14.046
Mm-hmm. Aw, hell.

20:14.080 --> 20:17.016
She just can't respect
boundaries, can she?

20:17.049 --> 20:19.352
It depends on
what those boundaries are.

20:19.386 --> 20:21.554
I think you need to tell her
to have a seat.

20:21.588 --> 20:22.589
LUCIOUS:
I think I'm-a get

20:22.622 --> 20:23.890
security to do that.

20:23.923 --> 20:25.057
Webb?

20:25.091 --> 20:27.059
Uh, that goon better not
put his hands on me.

20:27.093 --> 20:29.061
I know that damn much.
What's about to be said

20:29.095 --> 20:32.064
right here, you need to listen
with both ears.

20:32.098 --> 20:34.701
This club, my money,

20:34.734 --> 20:37.570
my fruits of my labor, that's
all for the woman that I love...

20:37.604 --> 20:39.071
Get your finger out of my face.

20:39.105 --> 20:40.607
And for my children.

20:42.342 --> 20:45.111
So, Giuliana,
it's time for you to kick rocks.

20:51.484 --> 20:52.919
Webb, get her
out of here, please.
WEBB: Ma'am, please.

20:52.952 --> 20:54.086
What are you talking about?
Come on.

20:54.120 --> 20:55.455
What are you talking
about, Lucious?

20:55.488 --> 20:57.089
Cookie is the love of my life.

20:57.123 --> 20:58.391
Always was,

20:58.425 --> 20:59.992
always will be.

21:00.026 --> 21:03.330
But you said you loved me.

21:03.363 --> 21:05.097
And then you took
$10 million from me.

21:07.266 --> 21:08.935
Okay.

21:08.968 --> 21:11.237
That's fine, but this club
still belongs to me.

21:11.270 --> 21:13.906
Oh, not according to
those papers you signed

21:13.940 --> 21:15.575
in my conference room
with all those lawyers;

21:15.608 --> 21:17.644
they were on my payroll.

21:17.677 --> 21:20.580
Empire owns
all of this.

21:20.613 --> 21:24.283
Laviticus is mine,
lock, stock and barrel.

21:28.988 --> 21:30.923
I would tell you
to watch your back,

21:30.957 --> 21:33.192
but I think you already know
what I'm capable of.

21:33.225 --> 21:34.327
WEBB:
Let's go.

21:34.361 --> 21:35.828
COOKIE: Right
now, you capable

21:35.862 --> 21:38.130
of getting escorted
out of the club that we took.

21:38.164 --> 21:39.499
Bye, bitch.

21:39.532 --> 21:40.867
You just gonna let her
talk to you like that

21:40.900 --> 21:42.134
and threaten you?

21:42.168 --> 21:44.103
I'm letting her leave
with some dignity.

21:44.136 --> 21:46.439
I got what I wanted.

21:46.473 --> 21:49.976
Both of us made
a bunch of sacrifices, baby.

21:50.009 --> 21:52.845
You sacrificed 17 years for me.

21:52.879 --> 21:55.682
I did all that
with Giuliana for you.

21:55.715 --> 21:57.384
Show's on in two, L.

21:57.417 --> 22:01.187
But why make me suffer
like that, Lucious?

22:01.220 --> 22:02.955
Because I wanted to see
your face when this happens.

22:02.989 --> 22:04.391
Come here.
When what happens?

22:04.424 --> 22:06.793
Come.

22:06.826 --> 22:08.828
(cheering and applause)

22:11.263 --> 22:13.733
*

22:13.766 --> 22:16.168
JAMAL:
* Come on *

22:16.202 --> 22:17.904
When Laviticus
Las Vegas presents

22:17.937 --> 22:20.039
When Cookie Met Lucious.

22:21.040 --> 22:22.341
* Let me hear you *

22:22.375 --> 22:23.576
* Mama, I love you *

22:23.610 --> 22:25.144
* Mama, Mama, Mama *

22:25.177 --> 22:27.580
* I do love you, yeah *

22:27.614 --> 22:29.516
* Mama, I love you *

22:29.549 --> 22:31.150
* Mama, Mama, Mama *

22:31.183 --> 22:33.420
* I do love you *
* Listen, Mama *

22:33.453 --> 22:36.255
* So many words
to describe you *

22:36.288 --> 22:38.391
* "Strong" would be
an understatement *

22:38.425 --> 22:40.226
* "Warrior" would *

22:40.259 --> 22:42.228
* Suit you so much better *

22:42.261 --> 22:43.930
* 'Cause you been fighting *

22:43.963 --> 22:45.498
* Seeing so much beauty *

22:45.532 --> 22:47.266
* From within *

22:47.299 --> 22:48.835
* You didn't have to get
what you giving *

22:48.868 --> 22:50.403
* You're so special *

22:50.437 --> 22:54.106
* I just want to take this time
to let you know *

22:56.075 --> 22:58.077
* There ain't nothing
more precious *

22:58.110 --> 23:00.012
* In this whole world *

23:00.046 --> 23:03.683
You were right,
as you usually are.

23:03.716 --> 23:05.351
The moment that I heard
his finished album,

23:05.384 --> 23:06.853
I knew that
that was our show.

23:06.886 --> 23:09.722
It's the story
of that little girl

23:09.756 --> 23:11.791
that I fell in love with,
that turned into

23:11.824 --> 23:13.693
this beautiful woman that's
in front of me right now.

23:13.726 --> 23:17.296
COOKIE: So, Jamal's been keeping
this a secret for two weeks?

23:18.598 --> 23:23.069
Okay, wait, I got to
make a phone call.

23:23.102 --> 23:25.905
* What this world can offer *

23:25.938 --> 23:27.940
(phone ringing)
Yeah?

23:27.974 --> 23:29.876
Call off your boys.
What?

23:29.909 --> 23:31.778
Call them off right now!
Why?

23:31.811 --> 23:33.412
Call them off now, damn it.

23:33.446 --> 23:34.847
You hear me?

23:35.915 --> 23:37.650
* To look in her eyes *

23:37.684 --> 23:39.886
* She's such a queen;
the perfect example *

23:39.919 --> 23:41.454
* Of pure royalty *

23:41.488 --> 23:43.990
* She gives it all
so unselfishly *

23:44.023 --> 23:45.257
* She does it all *

23:45.291 --> 23:46.626
* Just for loyalty *

23:46.659 --> 23:48.661
* That's my mama *

23:48.695 --> 23:51.498

Whoo!

25:02.334 --> 25:04.804
Oh, that was
beautiful, baby.

25:04.837 --> 25:06.505
That was beautiful.
(groans)

25:06.539 --> 25:09.742
Ah! God, man.
Yeah, that was for
trying to trick me.

25:09.776 --> 25:11.010
We gonna have to
start protecting you.

25:11.043 --> 25:12.044
You want some more?
No.

25:12.078 --> 25:13.179
Uh-huh.

25:13.212 --> 25:15.014
HAKEEM: Yo, I can't get
no family love?

Hakeem!
My brother!

25:16.348 --> 25:17.416

How you feeling, man?

25:19.051 --> 25:20.319
Perfect.
Yeah.

I got something to tell y'all.

25:21.420 --> 25:22.922
Can it wait?
I've got to go out there.

25:22.955 --> 25:24.924
Wait, wait, you performing?

25:24.957 --> 25:27.126
Yeah, I'm doing a song for
When Cookie Met Lucious.

Thank you.

Come on.

25:37.804 --> 25:40.272

25:40.306 --> 25:43.009
* Some people spend *

25:43.042 --> 25:45.211
* Most their lives *

25:45.244 --> 25:47.880
* Looking for someone
to lean on *

25:49.415 --> 25:51.417
* I have held dreams *

25:51.450 --> 25:53.119
* Once or twice *

25:53.152 --> 25:56.889
* Always with no one
to dream on *

25:56.923 --> 26:00.860
* Ooh *
* I was just out to find *

26:00.893 --> 26:02.962
* My own line of reason *

26:02.995 --> 26:04.496
* Oh, my, the freedom *

26:05.932 --> 26:08.434
* 'Cause life is
a ball of twine *

26:08.467 --> 26:10.236
* To be rolled out *

26:10.269 --> 26:12.238
* And weaved on *

26:12.271 --> 26:14.941
* So I just hold *

26:14.974 --> 26:16.809
* On tight *

26:16.843 --> 26:19.411
* Keep hoping things *

26:19.445 --> 26:22.248
* Will turn around *

26:22.281 --> 26:25.417
* I'm so glad *

26:25.451 --> 26:27.286
* Now that *

26:27.319 --> 26:30.623
* Finally found a love
I can lean on *

26:30.657 --> 26:32.625
* Finally found *

26:32.659 --> 26:34.894
* The truth to believe on *

26:34.927 --> 26:36.663
* Finally found *

26:36.696 --> 26:40.299

dream on with you *

26:41.868 --> 26:43.469
(audience cheers)

26:43.502 --> 26:45.171
* Ooh *

26:45.204 --> 26:47.974

in every person that you meet *

26:48.007 --> 26:49.642
* There's this little piece
of God in them *

26:49.676 --> 26:51.310
MAN:
Tell it!

26:51.343 --> 26:53.345

(cheering and applause)

26:55.381 --> 26:56.916
Come on, Daddy!

26:56.949 --> 26:58.350

26:58.384 --> 27:00.987
* A different life to lead on *

27:01.020 --> 27:02.922
* Dream on *
* I just got to *

27:02.955 --> 27:04.791
* Handle mine and *

27:04.824 --> 27:06.458
* Dream on *

27:06.492 --> 27:09.028
* Try to find me a better way
and ease on *

27:09.061 --> 27:10.462
* Ooh *

27:10.496 --> 27:12.832
* 'Cause life is
a mound of clay *

27:12.865 --> 27:15.935
* To be rolled out
and then shaped *

27:15.968 --> 27:18.137
* Sometimes our things break *

27:18.170 --> 27:21.307
* Ooh *
* But I'm out to find it, too *

27:21.340 --> 27:25.945
* So the rest of it's on you *

27:25.978 --> 27:27.346

27:27.379 --> 27:28.614
* So I just *

27:28.647 --> 27:30.349
* Hold *

27:30.382 --> 27:32.484

* Keep hoping things *
* Ooh *

27:34.586 --> 27:37.289
* Will turn around *

27:37.323 --> 27:38.524
* I'm *

27:38.557 --> 27:40.626
* So glad *

27:40.659 --> 27:43.229
* Now that I've finally found *

27:43.262 --> 27:45.865
* A love I can lean on *

27:45.898 --> 27:48.901
* Finally found the truth to *

27:48.935 --> 27:50.236
* Believe on *
Yeah!

27:50.269 --> 27:52.071
* Finally found *

27:52.104 --> 27:54.306
* This dream I *

27:54.340 --> 27:56.843
* Can dream on *

27:58.277 --> 27:59.578
* With you *

27:59.611 --> 28:00.880
* Dream on *

28:00.913 --> 28:02.414
* With you *

28:02.448 --> 28:04.851
* With you *
* Dream on *

28:04.884 --> 28:06.986
* With you *

28:07.019 --> 28:08.721
* Dream on with you. *

28:14.026 --> 28:15.995

continues)

28:16.028 --> 28:17.596
I love you, Mom.

28:17.629 --> 28:19.198
WOMAN:
That's a lot, baby!

28:19.231 --> 28:21.633
(cheering continues)

28:24.403 --> 28:27.173
DIANA: So, we are all
very eager to hear

28:27.206 --> 28:29.075
about your little performance.

28:29.108 --> 28:30.342
I was mediocre.

28:30.376 --> 28:31.844
My voice cracked twice,

28:31.878 --> 28:34.613
and my chords
were a little murky.

28:34.646 --> 28:36.248
But Jamal Lyon
thinks I'm gorgeous.

28:37.149 --> 28:38.517
(laughs)
Fabulous.

28:38.550 --> 28:39.886
Because we are.

28:39.919 --> 28:42.755
The DuBois twins are ready
for battle. Lyons beware.

28:42.789 --> 28:45.024
ANGELO: Well, knowing
Jamal as I do,

28:45.057 --> 28:49.028
I'm pretty sure this will be
one of our easier conquests.

28:49.061 --> 28:50.930
Angelo, do not be smug.

28:50.963 --> 28:53.966
The Lyon family
is formidable.

28:54.000 --> 28:56.936
However, I am confident
about Hakeem.

28:56.969 --> 28:58.437
So,

28:58.470 --> 28:59.972
here we go.

29:00.006 --> 29:01.040
¿Salud?

29:01.073 --> 29:04.143
ALL:
Salud.

29:04.176 --> 29:05.945
* Baby, it's you *

29:05.978 --> 29:07.446
* I'll always be
thinking of you *

29:07.479 --> 29:08.881
* I... *

29:08.915 --> 29:10.582
COOKIE: So, what you got
to tell us, boy?

29:10.616 --> 29:13.452
HAKEEM:
Dad, you killed it.
Thank you, son.

29:13.485 --> 29:16.322
Thank you, but who really killed
it was this mug right here.

29:16.355 --> 29:17.790
No, that's you, baby.
COOKIE:
Oh, yeah,

29:17.824 --> 29:19.158
both of y'all were good.
All you.

29:19.191 --> 29:20.626
Okay, look, look,
what do you have to tell us?

29:20.659 --> 29:21.627
Okay, so, look,

29:21.660 --> 29:22.862
Anika found Bella.

29:24.463 --> 29:26.765
What? Where?
Are you serious? Where? When?

29:26.799 --> 29:28.901
And, what-- have you seen her?
I seen her, Mom,

29:28.935 --> 29:30.169
I held her in my arms.

29:30.202 --> 29:31.603
I even got a picture of us.

29:32.872 --> 29:34.807
Boom.

29:34.841 --> 29:38.144
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God, it's amazing.

29:38.177 --> 29:39.145
COOKIE:
And she's okay?

29:39.178 --> 29:40.679
Where is she?
Wait, whose house is that?

29:40.712 --> 29:42.014
It's Anika's parents' house.

29:42.048 --> 29:43.850
She's there safe and sound
with them.

29:45.117 --> 29:46.452
This day
couldn't get better, man.

29:49.488 --> 29:51.123
* Give yourself
a round of applause... *

29:51.157 --> 29:53.359
*

29:53.392 --> 29:56.028
Hi, yes, this is Anika Calhoun.

29:56.062 --> 29:58.464
You guys-- no, no, no,
everything's divine.

29:58.497 --> 30:00.499
I was just wondering,
you guys wouldn't happen to have

30:00.532 --> 30:03.870
some, uh, hot sauce, would you?

30:03.903 --> 30:05.271
Fabulous.

30:05.304 --> 30:07.173
Yes, thank you, thank you.

30:07.206 --> 30:08.474
Bye-bye.

30:11.043 --> 30:12.278
(sighs)

30:12.311 --> 30:16.148
(cell phone rings)

30:16.182 --> 30:17.483
Hello?

30:17.516 --> 30:19.785
It's your future
ex-mother-in-law.

30:19.818 --> 30:21.653
Some more mail came for you.

30:21.687 --> 30:24.823
If you're still at the hotel,
I can just have it messengered.

30:24.857 --> 30:26.792
Yes, actually, can you send it
to The Peninsula

30:26.825 --> 30:28.895
in the penthouse suite?

30:28.928 --> 30:30.162
Thanks.

30:30.196 --> 30:32.098
Thank you.

30:44.376 --> 30:46.178
(knocks at door)

30:46.212 --> 30:47.579
Finally.

30:47.613 --> 30:49.315
Lord.

30:49.348 --> 30:51.583
How long's it take
to get some hot sauce in here?

30:56.588 --> 30:57.823
Anika Lyon?

30:57.856 --> 30:59.525
I prefer "Calhoun."

30:59.558 --> 31:02.361
You're under arrest
for the murder of Tariq Cousins.

31:02.394 --> 31:03.695
Excuse me?

31:03.729 --> 31:05.331
You have the right
to remain silent.

31:05.364 --> 31:07.199
Anything you say can
and will be used against you.

31:07.233 --> 31:08.567
You have the right
to an attorney.

31:08.600 --> 31:09.835
If you cannot
afford one,

31:09.868 --> 31:11.203
the court will
appoint one for you.

31:15.441 --> 31:18.244
*
(slot machines chiming)

31:18.277 --> 31:19.578
Hey, Loretha?

31:20.812 --> 31:22.548
Loretha.
Hey, Loretha...

31:22.581 --> 31:24.850
Oh, I know her.
COOKIE: Is that
Barry Hudson from Philly?

31:24.883 --> 31:27.386
Hey, is that Bar-- Barry?

31:27.419 --> 31:29.555
(laughs)
Oh, let him in.

31:29.588 --> 31:31.423
Let him in, Webb. Come back.
Guys, guys, let him in.

31:31.457 --> 31:33.892
Look at this. See? Hey.

31:33.926 --> 31:35.962
(Barry chuckling)

31:35.995 --> 31:37.429
COOKIE:
Barry, hey.
Hey.

31:37.463 --> 31:39.798
What are you
doing here?

31:39.831 --> 31:41.433
Oh, we're on vacation.

31:41.467 --> 31:42.734
Oh, my goodness,
have a seat.

31:42.768 --> 31:44.570
How are you, brother?
Good to see you.

31:44.603 --> 31:47.940
Uh, actually, uh,
celebrating a big milestone.

31:47.974 --> 31:49.608
Y'all want something to drink?

31:49.641 --> 31:51.743
No, no, no, no, no,
thank you, though.
(chuckles)

31:51.777 --> 31:53.745
This is my wife, Michelle.
Oh. Hi, how are you?

31:53.779 --> 31:55.281
Nice to meet you.
This is Cookie.
(chuckles)

31:55.314 --> 31:57.249
She saw that Lucious Lyon
was opening a show here.

31:57.283 --> 32:00.219
Uh, sold out,
but we got scalped tickets.

32:00.252 --> 32:02.388
She's a huge fan.

32:02.421 --> 32:04.156
She always teased
that I was

32:04.190 --> 32:05.992
confabulating when
I claimed I used to know you.

32:06.025 --> 32:07.459
Ah.
(Barry chuckles)
MICHELLE: Can you blame me?

32:07.493 --> 32:08.961
I mean, Barry isn't exactly
a hepcat.

32:08.995 --> 32:10.229
(laughs)

32:10.262 --> 32:11.797
Yeah, Barry knows us.

32:11.830 --> 32:14.766
I'm sure he wished
he never met us.

32:14.800 --> 32:16.802
Oh, come on, we were just
crazy kids, right?

32:16.835 --> 32:18.770
Everything worked out.

32:18.804 --> 32:21.473
I'm a doctor,
married to a doctor.

32:21.507 --> 32:23.009
Michelle and I had

32:23.042 --> 32:25.477
a nice, little family practice
out in Bala Cynwyd.

32:25.511 --> 32:27.113
"Had"? What happened?

32:27.146 --> 32:29.015
MICHELLE: Oh, well,
the big milestone

32:29.048 --> 32:30.782
that we're celebrating
is retirement.

32:30.816 --> 32:32.518
O-Our daughter, Sarah,
graduated from med school

32:32.551 --> 32:34.086
and joined the practice,

32:34.120 --> 32:36.122
and we just turned
the whole thing over to her.

32:36.155 --> 32:38.457
Your daughter's a doctor?
COOKIE:
Wow, that's amazing.

32:38.490 --> 32:39.691
Congratulations.
MICHELLE:
Thanks.

32:39.725 --> 32:41.027
BARRY:
So now we can just...

32:41.060 --> 32:42.794
cut loose,

32:42.828 --> 32:44.363
see the world,
enjoy each other.

32:46.898 --> 32:49.101
Anyway, um, here's my card.

32:49.135 --> 32:51.803
I know you've probably got
a million people to talk to,

32:51.837 --> 32:53.939
but maybe we can all have
dinner before we leave town.

32:53.972 --> 32:55.774
I'd like that.
We'd like that.

32:55.807 --> 32:57.476
Yeah, you know what? Let...

32:57.509 --> 32:59.278
why don't we take
a picture together?

32:59.311 --> 33:01.813
Oh. Oh, wow, that's nice
of you to... thank you.
(sniffles)

33:01.847 --> 33:03.015
Let's just break protocol.

33:03.049 --> 33:04.316
(laughs)
Appreciate it.

33:04.350 --> 33:05.684
Come on, y'all got scalped
tickets.
(laughs)

33:05.717 --> 33:06.952
You might as well
get a real picture.

33:06.985 --> 33:08.487
Oh, appreciate it.
There you go.

33:08.520 --> 33:09.821
Oh, good one, baby.

33:09.855 --> 33:11.357
Okay, good.
Thank you so much, really.

33:11.390 --> 33:13.292
No, no, thank y'all.
Thanks y'all for, uh,
having us come in.

33:13.325 --> 33:15.294
Yeah, thanks.

33:15.327 --> 33:17.163
It was such a pleasure
seeing you.
(chuckles)

33:17.196 --> 33:19.465
I can't believe
all these years.
You, too.

33:19.498 --> 33:21.833
Congratulations again.
(chuckles)
Thank you.

33:21.867 --> 33:24.002
Yeah.
My man.

33:24.036 --> 33:25.237
Pleasure seeing you again.

33:25.271 --> 33:26.672
Thank you.
Thank you so much.

33:26.705 --> 33:27.906
Y'all take care.
Thank you.

33:27.939 --> 33:29.575
Come on.

33:29.608 --> 33:31.510
Hey, man, I told you
we could see them.

33:31.543 --> 33:33.079
They're so sweet.
They're nice people.

33:33.112 --> 33:34.446
MICHELLE:
That's crazy.

33:36.448 --> 33:38.817
Wow.

33:38.850 --> 33:41.687
I'm not gonna lie...

33:41.720 --> 33:44.356
that kind of stirred up
my feelings.

33:46.192 --> 33:48.160
Did you see the way they were
holding hands with each other

33:48.194 --> 33:49.928
and looking at each other?

33:49.961 --> 33:51.897
Mm-hmm.
Say to hell with it.

33:51.930 --> 33:53.399
Why don't we just take a page

33:53.432 --> 33:55.601
right out of Barry
and-and Michelle's book?

33:57.203 --> 33:59.571
I want to see the world
with you, Cook.

33:59.605 --> 34:02.241
I want to write
a new page in our story,

34:02.274 --> 34:05.911
far away from the backbiting
and the drama.

34:05.944 --> 34:08.914
You created that drama
by pitting your sons

34:08.947 --> 34:10.449
against each other.

34:12.451 --> 34:15.887
I created it, but together
we can uncreate it.

34:15.921 --> 34:19.925
What you doing down
there, Grandpa?

34:19.958 --> 34:21.793
Better get off them
arthritic knees.

34:21.827 --> 34:23.762
(laughs)
(smooches)
What do you say?

34:23.795 --> 34:25.131
What do I say what?

34:25.164 --> 34:27.699
(chuckles)
Say yes.

34:27.733 --> 34:29.401
See the world with me.

34:29.435 --> 34:32.104
I say your ass need
to have a ring.

34:32.138 --> 34:34.940
I can buy you
a whole jewelry store.

34:34.973 --> 34:36.642
(both laugh)

34:39.478 --> 34:41.947
COOKIE: Andre.

34:44.250 --> 34:45.984
I've been looking
for you all day.

34:46.017 --> 34:47.719
Where the hell you been?
Shine told me you backing out...

34:47.753 --> 34:49.555
Shut up. Shut up, boy. We not
gonna mention that no more.

34:49.588 --> 34:51.590
Hey, y'all,
look who I found.

34:51.623 --> 34:52.991
JAMAL: Uh-oh, Dre.
HAKEEM: Hey.

34:53.024 --> 34:54.593
What's up?
Hey, what's up?
There you are.

34:54.626 --> 34:56.462
Bro, bro, what's up, man?
ANDRE:
What's up?

34:58.029 --> 35:00.432
Listen up, y'all, um,

35:00.466 --> 35:02.234
your mother and I
have something

35:02.268 --> 35:03.635
we want to share
with you three.

35:03.669 --> 35:04.836
We made a decision.

35:04.870 --> 35:06.172
What kind of decision?

35:06.205 --> 35:08.307
A big one.

35:08.340 --> 35:13.179
We have decided to step down
from the day-to-day operations

35:13.212 --> 35:14.713
of Empire.

35:16.948 --> 35:18.517
Hold on, wait,
is one of y'all sick?

35:18.550 --> 35:19.851
No.
No.

35:19.885 --> 35:21.587
(chuckles)
The opposite.

35:21.620 --> 35:24.823
(chuckles)
We are actually
very well and of sound mind,

35:24.856 --> 35:26.592
and now that you've
got Bella back...

35:26.625 --> 35:27.959
And that bitch is gone--

35:27.993 --> 35:29.461
and I don't want to ever
hear her name again.

35:29.495 --> 35:30.862
(chuckling)

35:30.896 --> 35:33.665
(laughs)
Okay. Forgive me.

35:33.699 --> 35:35.967
Um, we just realized

35:36.001 --> 35:38.870
that life is too short.

35:38.904 --> 35:40.972
Mm.
And we want to spend
the rest of it

35:41.006 --> 35:44.976
doing something we fantasized
about when we were kids.

35:45.010 --> 35:46.044
Being happy.

35:46.077 --> 35:47.145
Being happy.

35:47.179 --> 35:48.314
(chuckles)

35:48.347 --> 35:50.015
And, Jamal,
you been talking forever

35:50.048 --> 35:52.818
about us breaking the cycle.

35:52.851 --> 35:54.019
Well, it's time.

35:55.354 --> 35:58.957
And it's time that I...

35:58.990 --> 36:01.360
do something I should've
done years ago.

36:05.531 --> 36:06.598
What's this?

36:11.069 --> 36:13.539
The keys to the kingdom,
literally.

36:15.040 --> 36:16.408
Those are my office keys.

36:17.909 --> 36:19.545
Thirsty is gonna have
some papers drawn up

36:19.578 --> 36:23.715
for the board's approval,
but it's all yours, Dre.

36:25.217 --> 36:26.685
Mine?
COOKIE:
Yes, baby.

36:26.718 --> 36:28.687
We should've done this
a long time ago.

36:30.021 --> 36:32.023
Hakeem and-and
Jamal are artists,

36:32.057 --> 36:33.392
with huge

36:33.425 --> 36:36.061
careers ahead of them

36:36.094 --> 36:38.997
and they need a strong company
to stand behind them.

36:39.030 --> 36:42.033
And, baby, XStream,

36:42.067 --> 36:44.403
Empire XStream,
that was all you.

36:44.436 --> 36:45.904
This Vegas deal

36:45.937 --> 36:47.339
was all you.

36:47.373 --> 36:48.707
You are the one

36:48.740 --> 36:50.776
to take Empire
to the next level.

36:54.713 --> 36:57.249
Said that I was a liability.

36:59.084 --> 37:00.586
I was scared of you.

37:01.820 --> 37:03.121
Because I'd grown up

37:03.154 --> 37:04.723
with a mother
that had your issues

37:04.756 --> 37:06.925
and so they
became issues for me.

37:06.958 --> 37:09.528
But I've found out
that condition

37:09.561 --> 37:12.097
that you were born with,
it gave you a brain

37:12.130 --> 37:14.766
that can outmaneuver
any man on the chessboard,

37:14.800 --> 37:16.067
including myself.

37:17.969 --> 37:20.572
And you can control it
when you have the support

37:20.606 --> 37:23.642
of your family around you.
That's right.

37:23.675 --> 37:26.578
And when you're taking
care of yourself, son,

37:26.612 --> 37:28.747
you're unstoppable.

37:28.780 --> 37:32.618
And I want y'all to make sure
y'all give him the support

37:32.651 --> 37:34.886
that he needs.
That's right.

37:34.920 --> 37:37.088
You deserve it, bro.

37:37.122 --> 37:38.424
Congrats.

37:38.457 --> 37:40.158
Y'all already know.

37:40.191 --> 37:41.993
The boss.

37:42.027 --> 37:43.995
(chuckles)
Congrats, man.

37:46.465 --> 37:48.166
LUCIOUS:
Look, your mother and I

37:48.199 --> 37:50.402
want you to know know
how very proud we are

37:50.436 --> 37:53.939
to have you
as our firstborn.

37:55.374 --> 37:57.976
Lucious, just tell
the boy you love him.

37:58.009 --> 38:00.245
The hell out of here.
Ugh.

38:00.278 --> 38:01.413
(laughs)

38:01.447 --> 38:03.415
Well, look, I'm-a fly
back on the jet tonight.

38:03.449 --> 38:05.684
I want to get back so
I can be ready with Bella.

38:05.717 --> 38:07.986
COOKIE:
All right.

38:08.019 --> 38:09.421
Give her a hug for me.
Kiss her for me.
(chuckles)

38:09.455 --> 38:10.856
Wait for me 'cause I'm-a
roll with you, a'ight?

38:10.889 --> 38:13.124
HAKEEM:
Hurry up.
(stammers)
You have a show to do.

38:13.158 --> 38:14.793
When Cookie Met Lucious
is officially dropping.

38:14.826 --> 38:16.161
I know, but we a hit.

38:16.194 --> 38:17.463
(both laugh)

38:17.496 --> 38:18.664
Look, I'll be back on Sunday.

38:18.697 --> 38:20.632
I just want to spend
the weekend in New York.

38:20.666 --> 38:23.134
Ah, yeah, I met somebody.
Dang, all up in my business.

38:23.168 --> 38:24.603
Mm-hmm.
All up in here.

38:24.636 --> 38:25.771
Uh-huh.

38:25.804 --> 38:28.840
It's all good...
Shine!

38:28.874 --> 38:30.776
Where's Franco?

38:30.809 --> 38:32.611
He's not answering
his phone.

38:32.644 --> 38:34.446
Franco left already.
I got the app right here.

38:34.480 --> 38:35.614
Well, give it to me.
I'm calling it off.

38:35.647 --> 38:37.148
Come again.

38:37.182 --> 38:40.285
My family just handed me
control of the company, Shine.

38:40.318 --> 38:41.487
Okay?

38:41.520 --> 38:43.154
I promise you
you won't be left out.

38:43.188 --> 38:44.390
Okay, Lucious just
mounted a hit show.

38:44.423 --> 38:45.524
You get a piece of that, too.
Give me the app.

38:45.557 --> 38:47.292
Give me the phone.
Come on, give me the app.

38:47.325 --> 38:48.794
Shine, give me...

38:48.827 --> 38:50.161
Man, keep your promises.

38:50.195 --> 38:52.197
It's so funny.

38:52.230 --> 38:54.132
You always saying
we from the same place,

38:54.165 --> 38:55.634
but we ain't the same!

38:55.667 --> 38:57.002
There's a code.

38:57.035 --> 38:58.236
And the code says you
can't bring it back

38:58.269 --> 39:00.539
when the bullet leaves the gun.

39:00.572 --> 39:02.173
You started this.
I'm-a finish it.

39:02.207 --> 39:03.809
Now get him out of here.
You'll have to shoot me.

39:03.842 --> 39:04.976
Get off of me!

39:05.010 --> 39:06.277
Pop!

39:08.414 --> 39:09.381
LUCIOUS:
Let's go to Bermuda.

39:09.415 --> 39:10.716
(Cookie laughs)

39:10.749 --> 39:12.050
We talked about that
when we were kids.

39:12.083 --> 39:13.719
Bermuda is played
out, child.

39:13.752 --> 39:15.320
You have to take me
to Turks and Caicos.

39:15.353 --> 39:17.689
Well, then why don't I
just buy us our own island?

39:17.723 --> 39:19.658
COOKIE:
Oh, you think you slick?

39:19.691 --> 39:20.859
You think you can
get in my drawers

39:20.892 --> 39:22.394
by saying something
slick like that?

39:22.428 --> 39:24.262
No, I want to get
in your heart.
Oh. (chuckles)

39:24.295 --> 39:26.364
Come on.
(laughs)

39:26.398 --> 39:27.533
ANDRE: Pop!

39:27.566 --> 39:28.700
Ma!

39:28.734 --> 39:29.768
What, boy?

39:29.801 --> 39:30.869
ANDRE: Move!

39:30.902 --> 39:32.370
Get away from the car!

39:32.404 --> 39:33.405
Why?

39:33.439 --> 39:34.440
LUCIOUS: Go!

39:41.079 --> 39:43.114
Ma!

39:43.148 --> 39:45.116
Dad!

39:50.221 --> 39:52.458
No, it's lit.
No, no, no, no.

39:54.926 --> 39:57.763
(echoing):
Lucious!

39:57.796 --> 40:00.065
No!

40:09.274 --> 40:11.677
(heart monitor beeping)

40:14.846 --> 40:16.982
"To my friend, Lucious Lyon.

40:17.015 --> 40:19.818
"I can't wait until
you come back roaring.

40:19.851 --> 40:21.052
"Best wishes

40:21.086 --> 40:22.888
"for a speedy recovery.

40:22.921 --> 40:25.090
All my love, Stevie."

40:25.123 --> 40:26.992
JAMAL:
Dad, that's amazing, man.

40:27.025 --> 40:29.160
It's Stevie, huh?
Yeah.

40:29.194 --> 40:31.262
He's in a coma.
He can't hear nothing.

40:31.296 --> 40:32.263
Shut up, boy.

40:32.297 --> 40:35.100
WOMAN: He can hear
a lot more than you think.

40:37.135 --> 40:40.305
I've had patients
in your father's condition

40:40.338 --> 40:41.840
come out of comas after months,

40:41.873 --> 40:43.509
actually, sometimes
even years,

40:43.542 --> 40:45.310
and recall everything.

40:46.344 --> 40:47.746
So, you might want
to watch what you say.

40:47.779 --> 40:49.014
Can you please make sure

40:49.047 --> 40:50.816
that those scans that Dr. West
ordered are loaded in?

40:50.849 --> 40:52.050
Yes, ma'am.
Thank you.

40:54.285 --> 40:57.355
So, it's, uh, story time.

40:57.388 --> 40:59.658
Tonight I was gonna read
the short story by Borges,

40:59.691 --> 41:01.159
the one you said that he loved.

41:01.192 --> 41:03.228
Yeah.

41:08.534 --> 41:10.368
Dwight.

41:16.842 --> 41:19.344
(whispering):
Dwight.

41:30.822 --> 41:32.558
Dwight.

41:33.491 --> 41:34.993
Dwight.

41:36.327 --> 41:37.996
Uh.
(clears throat)

41:40.999 --> 41:42.534
You can go.

41:42.568 --> 41:45.336
Oh, no, we're not going nowhere
no time soon.

41:45.370 --> 41:47.539
You mind telling us
why you sent that nurse

41:47.573 --> 41:50.408
for the scans?
Mrs. Lyon, you know
that I am not at liberty

41:50.441 --> 41:52.711
to discuss his test results.

41:52.744 --> 41:55.581
Okay, well, then are you at
liberty to lose your damn job?
Ma.

41:55.614 --> 41:57.583
Because... no, we are
paying for all of this.
JAMAL: Okay, but calm down.

41:57.616 --> 41:59.585
She's just trying to help, Mom.
You supposed to do
what I tell you to do.

41:59.618 --> 42:01.352
JAMAL:
Just calm down.
It's okay.

42:01.386 --> 42:02.888
She's just helping out.
(clears throat)

42:02.921 --> 42:04.656
It's all right.
She doesn't need to calm down.

42:04.690 --> 42:06.391
I understand.
This is very stressful.

42:06.424 --> 42:08.026
Yeah, I'm stressed

42:08.059 --> 42:09.194
and the last thing
you should be doing

42:09.227 --> 42:10.395
is telling me how stressed I am.

42:10.428 --> 42:11.830
It's rude.
JAMAL: Ma.

42:11.863 --> 42:13.231
ANDRE:
Mom, let's-let's just go.

42:13.264 --> 42:14.332
COOKIE:
You know what?

42:14.365 --> 42:17.402
(sighs)
All right.

42:17.435 --> 42:19.104
Give me my stuff, boy.

42:19.137 --> 42:22.273
Look, I know you some kind of
special nurse and all of that,

42:22.307 --> 42:24.075
but it's been three months

42:24.109 --> 42:25.410
and he still look
like a vegetable,

42:25.443 --> 42:27.078
so maybe you ain't
so damn special.

42:27.112 --> 42:28.880
Come on, Dad.
We'll see you tomorrow.

42:28.914 --> 42:31.549
COOKIE:
Yes, you will see me tomorrow.

42:32.584 --> 42:33.785
Mom, Mom.

42:33.819 --> 42:36.421
Look, Ma.
Come here.

42:36.454 --> 42:37.555
What?
Dad.

42:37.589 --> 42:38.924
(stammers)
I'm-I'm not tripping.

42:38.957 --> 42:40.291
H-His eyes were open.
They're closed now,

42:40.325 --> 42:41.492
but I swear,
they-they fluttered.

42:42.628 --> 42:43.662
Pop, can you hear us?
HAKEEM: Dad.

42:45.130 --> 42:46.998
Lucious?

42:50.235 --> 42:51.236
Ooh! There he is.

42:51.269 --> 42:52.738

Lucious!
Yeah.

42:52.771 --> 42:54.940
Lucious! Lucious.
JAMAL (muffled):
Yo, what's up, Dad?

42:54.973 --> 42:57.876
Come on, man, what's up?

42:59.811 --> 43:02.347
Cookie, yes. Cookie.

43:04.415 --> 43:05.784
Who are you?

43:05.817 --> 43:07.052
Cookie.

43:07.085 --> 43:08.153
It's us.

Yeah, we're here.

43:10.622 --> 43:11.957

43:14.492 --> 43:16.227

It's okay.

43:16.261 --> 43:18.630
It's your family.
JAMAL:
Yeah, man, it's all right.

43:18.664 --> 43:20.098
We're here.

Something
