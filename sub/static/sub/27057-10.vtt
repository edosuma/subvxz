00:00.546 --> 00:02.812
<i>Previously on
"Berlin Station"...</i>

00:02.857 --> 00:04.241
Did you see Hector?

00:04.285 --> 00:05.647
Yeah, I'm...
I'm supposed to meet him

00:05.671 --> 00:07.307
at an abandoned green dacha.

00:07.351 --> 00:09.113
He was killed yesterday

00:09.157 --> 00:12.809
by someone who had enough
medical knowledge to use it.

00:12.853 --> 00:15.329
- We were talking on the phone.
- I heard screams.

00:15.373 --> 00:16.777
Jan told me
something was happening,

00:16.801 --> 00:18.605
and then we were disconnected.

00:18.649 --> 00:20.117
Could you shut the server down?

00:20.161 --> 00:22.069
Yes. But I'd need
a hard-line connection

00:22.093 --> 00:23.561
to the server to do it.

00:23.605 --> 00:24.883
I need to get these folks
on the ground.

00:24.907 --> 00:25.997
Tapa and Tallinn.

00:29.947 --> 00:31.141
What the hell do you want,
Kolya?

00:31.165 --> 00:32.445
I want to stop Platov.

00:34.525 --> 00:36.497
Right now, we are looking at
$480 million.

00:37.549 --> 00:39.311
The ground forces
I spotted near Tapa

00:39.355 --> 00:41.579
will take out
the NATO trip-wire force.

00:41.623 --> 00:43.091
Shut the fuck up.

00:43.135 --> 00:44.435
Or what?

00:44.479 --> 00:46.577
The next player
won't fucking knock!

00:46.621 --> 00:49.075
I'm just an old spook
telling stories.

00:49.099 --> 00:50.567
There was someone else.
Diver.

00:50.611 --> 00:51.617
And you killed my mother?

02:03.733 --> 02:05.705
Daniel, what the fuck is this?

02:07.723 --> 02:09.905
Pretty easy to fool
everybody, right?

02:11.755 --> 02:14.945
I'm dead.

02:16.291 --> 02:18.641
Aren't I?

02:18.685 --> 02:20.237
Not yet.

02:20.281 --> 02:22.883
Steven?

02:22.927 --> 02:24.647
You're back, buddy.

02:24.691 --> 02:26.663
I was worried.

02:26.707 --> 02:29.729
At are you,
my fucking spirit guide?

02:29.773 --> 02:31.283
That's right.

02:31.327 --> 02:32.479
After all the shit we pulled,

02:32.503 --> 02:34.117
which direction do you think
we're going?

02:34.141 --> 02:38.171
That way or that?

02:38.215 --> 02:40.313
It's all right.

02:40.357 --> 02:42.797
The Devil's not
done with you yet.

02:52.747 --> 02:56.441
Jesus, Ble.

02:56.485 --> 02:59.675
Either die
or quit your fucking whining.

02:59.719 --> 03:02.951
Look how you bled
all over our Egyptian sheets.

03:02.995 --> 03:04.883
They are ruined.

03:04.927 --> 03:07.571
Wait a minute.

03:07.615 --> 03:09.461
How the fuck did I get here?

03:09.505 --> 03:12.863
My men found you
on the edge of my grounds.

03:12.907 --> 03:15.467
Who patched me up?

03:15.511 --> 03:17.777
My physician.

03:17.821 --> 03:21.305
How do you go from
trusted by Krik

03:21.349 --> 03:25.253
to hunted by Krik
in less than 24 hour

03:27.649 --> 03:29.999
Fuck the story.

03:30.043 --> 03:33.485
We cut to the end.

03:37.813 --> 03:42.221
You stitched me up
because I'm valuable. Right?

03:42.265 --> 03:46.295
I have access.

03:46.339 --> 03:48.353
I can get you anything.

03:50.161 --> 03:53.183
I have everything I want.

03:56.587 --> 03:58.307
What is missing?

03:58.351 --> 04:01.457
One last "fuck you"
to Krik and Platov.

04:03.727 --> 04:08.471
You can take his fortune
in the free port.

04:08.515 --> 04:11.201
The Kremlin will
seize Krik's fortune.

04:11.245 --> 04:13.973
And that coward's
in a courtroom cage.

04:14.017 --> 04:15.863
There's still time.

04:15.907 --> 04:17.543
But you've got to jump.

04:22.123 --> 04:24.473
Now, Krik's out, Platov's in,

04:24.517 --> 04:29.429
and the next person
he's coming for is you.

04:29.473 --> 04:32.873
Especially aft that
dumb-as-fuck stunt you pulled.

04:32.917 --> 04:36.443
Sending someone to kill him
at the club.

04:36.487 --> 04:39.929
I can take him down
before he gets to you.

04:42.199 --> 04:45.977
Your wound is infected.

04:46.021 --> 04:48.455
My doctor says you may stl die.

04:48.499 --> 04:51.227
So, what's new?

04:51.271 --> 04:54.629
All I need is of your best men.

04:56.731 --> 05:00.383
And some clothes.

05:08.365 --> 05:11.051
I was Diver's mentor.

05:11.095 --> 05:13.487
I made him.

05:13.531 --> 05:16.637
Call me
Doctor Fucking Frankenstein.

05:16.681 --> 05:19.241
<i>He was a good man.</i>

05:19.285 --> 05:22.895
<i>He was a friend of mine.</i>

05:22.939 --> 05:24.953
<i>And he was a traitor.</i>

05:31.171 --> 05:33.899
It's Hector.

05:33.943 --> 05:36.965
Oh, thank Christ.

05:39.277 --> 05:40.597
Oh, my God.
Sorry to disappoint. st you, too.

05:40.621 --> 05:43.055
I caught a slug,
nothing serious.

05:43.099 --> 05:44.609
Where are you?

05:44.653 --> 05:46.415
Berlin.

05:46.459 --> 05:47.821
Uh, after you and Torres
missed exfil...

05:47.845 --> 05:49.691
Wait a minute.

05:49.735 --> 05:51.601
What do you mean when you said
you thought you'd st me, too?

05:51.625 --> 05:53.177
Where's Daniel?

05:53.221 --> 05:55.151
You haven't heard?

05:55.195 --> 05:57.377
Oh, Jesus, Hector.

05:59.605 --> 06:01.955
Daniel didn't make it.

06:01.999 --> 06:06.197
They dumped his body
back in Berlin.

06:06.241 --> 06:09.809
And Platov's trying to
cover his tracks.

06:15.397 --> 06:18.797
But, uh...

06:18.841 --> 06:21.317
I... I, um...

06:21.361 --> 06:25.349
I de it
to the green dacha, Steven.

06:25.393 --> 06:28.625
The rally point?

06:28.669 --> 06:31.355
Geez, we must've
missed each other.

06:37.741 --> 06:42.023
Did you see anything?

06:42.067 --> 06:47.693
Um... bits and pieces,
I...

06:47.737 --> 06:48.827
I can't...

06:48.871 --> 06:51.725
Where are you?

06:51.769 --> 06:55.547
Stl in Komarovo.

06:55.591 --> 06:59.411
Heading to St. Petersburg
with Timur Jadovsky.

06:59.455 --> 07:02.099
Dangerous company.

07:02.143 --> 07:06.971
Tell, uh... tell Valerie
I'm doing her one last solid,

07:07.015 --> 07:09.995
then she'd better
lose my fucking number.

07:10.039 --> 07:11.927
You too.

07:35.785 --> 07:39.605
Dorn
<i>By '81, Diver was in Moscow.</i>

07:39.649 --> 07:43.721
He was married by that time.

07:43.765 --> 07:46.955
Great girl.

07:46.999 --> 07:50.105
One night, the newlyweds
have a night out,

07:50.149 --> 07:52.583
<i>tossed back a few.</i>

07:52.627 --> 07:55.649
<i>Diver's wife shouldn't have
been driving,</i>

07:55.693 --> 07:58.925
<i>but she was in much better
shape than Diver was.</i>

07:58.969 --> 08:05.183
So, the worst befalls them.

08:05.227 --> 08:08.501
She kills a destrian.

08:08.545 --> 08:12.785
Her blood alcohol level's
through the roof.

08:12.829 --> 08:15.935
They offered Diver a choice.

08:15.979 --> 08:18.035
If he don't want his young bride

08:18.079 --> 08:21.983
rotting away in some gulag,
dot, dot, dot...

08:22.027 --> 08:24.797
You know the deal.

08:27.571 --> 08:32.735
<i>The Soviets ran Diver as
a double for...</i>

08:32.779 --> 08:35.717
<i>fuck, years.</i>

08:35.760 --> 08:42.605
And it all came crashing down,
November 9, 1989,

08:42.649 --> 08:46.049
the night we won the Cold War.

08:49.789 --> 08:54.197
<i>Saving Henrik Viiding,
hmm, that was the pretext.</i>

08:54.241 --> 08:58.229
<i>Diver crossed over to the east,</i>

08:58.273 --> 09:00.013
<i>and he changed history at night,</i>

09:00.037 --> 09:01.757
<i>for one reason only...</i>

09:01.801 --> 09:04.823
Self-preservation,

09:04.867 --> 09:08.309
to make sure his sins
would stay buried.

09:12.553 --> 09:18.053
When the Stasi started
burning their files,

09:18.097 --> 09:21.245
Divemade damn sure his files
burned up with them.

09:24.733 --> 09:27.335
<i>I know what you all
want to hear.</i>

09:27.379 --> 09:30.443
<i>You want Der's real name.</i>

09:30.487 --> 09:34.601
<i>You want to know
what happened to him.</i>

09:34.645 --> 09:39.053
<i>Well, you're just gonna
have to tune in tomorrow...</i>

09:39.097 --> 09:44.597
<i>for my final podcast.</i>

09:44.641 --> 09:49.343
<i>And I promise you,
all will be revealed.</i>

09:54.721 --> 09:57.911
Time to hold up
your end of the bargain.

09:57.955 --> 10:00.053
My men are waiting

10:00.097 --> 10:03.497
He's just had surgery
and he's fighting sepsis.

10:03.541 --> 10:07.949
If he doesn't rest,
he'll be dead in two day

10:07.993 --> 10:10.427
I only need him for two hours.

10:10.471 --> 10:13.409
Long enough to get him
to the freeport.

10:16.141 --> 10:18.239
No rest for the wicked.

10:24.289 --> 10:26.891
Robert, it's B.B.

10:26.935 --> 10:30.797
Can't dodge my calls forever.

10:30.841 --> 10:32.813
I'm not leaving!

10:37.855 --> 10:39.239
What are you doing here?

10:39.283 --> 10:41.423
We need you at work.

10:41.467 --> 10:43.901
I can't, uh, leave just now.

10:45.877 --> 10:48.037
What are you doing over here?

10:48.061 --> 10:50.621
Hey, what's going on in here?

10:52.513 --> 10:54.485
What the fuck?!
Who is this woman?!

10:54.529 --> 10:56.815
It's my neighbor.
Nina Bartek.

10:56.839 --> 10:58.307
She's been spying on me.

10:58.351 --> 11:00.659
I'm telling you, always around,
coincidences.

11:00.703 --> 11:02.359
It's impossible.
I'm telling you, B.B.

11:02.383 --> 11:04.565
She's a fucking spook. -Do?

11:04.609 --> 11:07.337
Robert, please tell me
you have evidence.

11:07.381 --> 11:08.933
There were noises.

11:08.977 --> 11:11.305
I heard... I heard noises
in my apartment.

11:11.329 --> 11:14.351
And she took my mail and...
And she's always around,

11:14.395 --> 11:16.891
in the hallway, outside,
always running into me.

11:16.915 --> 11:19.937
And Basarov,
the day he fucking bled out,

11:19.981 --> 11:22.393
she stopped my watch.
She bent the pin.

11:22.417 --> 11:24.157
That was the sign for Basarov
to kill himself.

11:24.181 --> 11:25.523
So it's your intuition?

11:25.567 --> 11:27.097
Which we're supposed to trust,
right?

11:27.121 --> 11:29.177
You've been under
a lot of stress.

11:29.221 --> 11:32.747
No. No.
This isn't about Daniel.

11:32.791 --> 11:35.183
We're all grieving.

11:35.227 --> 11:38.039
But we're moving against Platov
and I need you.

11:38.083 --> 11:40.559
I don't care what Wolfe says.

11:40.603 --> 11:42.743
Okay.

11:42.787 --> 11:44.905
Okay.
How can I help?

11:44.929 --> 11:46.313
Well, if this woman's a foreig,

11:46.357 --> 11:48.329
take her in and question her.

11:48.373 --> 11:50.261
By the book.

11:50.305 --> 11:52.781
That makes sense.

11:55.555 --> 11:58.283
Robert?!

12:09.835 --> 12:11.429
Just let me leave.

12:11.473 --> 12:12.833
I'm going out of that door.

12:12.859 --> 12:13.969
I can't do that.

12:13.993 --> 12:15.881
Don't make it anharder.

12:28.777 --> 12:31.001
Drop it.

12:31.045 --> 12:32.681
Drop it.

12:37.975 --> 12:40.367
Oh, Robert!

12:40.411 --> 12:43.433
Oh, Robert!
Don't die on me.

12:49.609 --> 12:55.739
Oh, Robert!
Don't die on me.

12:55.783 --> 12:57.775
Esther, it's B.B.
No time to explain.

12:57.799 --> 12:59.813
I need an APB on a Nina Bartek,

12:59.857 --> 13:03.047
170 centimeters, red hair.
Consider her dangerous.

13:03.091 --> 13:04.747
Last known was Markisches Ufer.

13:04.771 --> 13:06.763
We think she has connections
with the Russians.

13:06.787 --> 13:09.107
She attacked Robert Kirsch
with some kind of weapon.

13:27.745 --> 13:32.321
So...
you met my friends.

13:32.365 --> 13:34.967
What do you think?

13:35.011 --> 13:37.487
I think it's exactly
the type of place

13:37.531 --> 13:39.503
I pictured you spending
your spare time in, Kolya.

13:39.547 --> 13:42.149
I thought we might begin with

13:42.193 --> 13:44.753
a briefing on Berlin Station's
countermeasure.

13:44.797 --> 13:47.147
Please.

13:48.283 --> 13:50.927
Still playing games, I see.

13:58.279 --> 14:01.679
I'm not playing games, Valerie.

14:01.723 --> 14:05.795
There is much to fear here.

14:05.839 --> 14:08.567
For both of us.

14:20.203 --> 14:25.115
Platov is powering the blackout
using Tervik's servers.

14:25.159 --> 14:28.433
April Lewis is inbound
with a tactical team

14:28.477 --> 14:30.323
positioning fia Vesik
where she needs to be

14:30.367 --> 14:32.297
so she could
power the lights back on.

14:32.341 --> 14:34.061
Vesik?

14:34.105 --> 14:35.531
Bold.

14:35.575 --> 14:38.555
Bold.

14:38.599 --> 14:44.687
You are moving your queen
off the back row, huh?

14:44.731 --> 14:48.173
I also have a man on the ground
in Tapa.

14:48.217 --> 14:51.575
He'll take out Rodion Volkov.

14:51.619 --> 14:53.423
Cut the head off the snake.

14:53.467 --> 14:55.753
Even with the power restored,

14:55.777 --> 15:00.101
even with half his force
neutralized,

15:00.145 --> 15:04.973
Platov will not relent.

15:05.017 --> 15:08.543
What we need is
a show of military force.

15:08.587 --> 15:10.223
After the 14-Eyes vote,

15:10.267 --> 15:13.121
we have no hope
of military options.

15:13.165 --> 15:15.011
A <i> show</i> of force.

15:15.055 --> 15:18.287
If we can crte
an American intel cable

15:18.331 --> 15:24.671
stating that U.S. and NATO
is in a position to strike,

15:24.715 --> 15:29.333
I can make sure Platov
receives it and believes it.

15:33.829 --> 15:35.633
I can do you one better.

15:48.865 --> 15:50.207
Go ahead, Valerie.

15:50.251 --> 15:51.811
Do you still have that
survllance drone

15:51.847 --> 15:54.197
flying over Estonia?

15:54.241 --> 15:56.255
It's mine for the next 12 hours.

15:56.299 --> 15:58.607
Good.

15:58.651 --> 15:59.783
I need you to crash it.

15:59.827 --> 16:03.269
What's the play?

16:03.313 --> 16:06.587
We need to send up
fake intel for Platov.

16:06.631 --> 16:09.695
Convince him NATO is coming,
and maybe he'll back down.

16:22.465 --> 16:24.793
Blake. I heard you were
six feet under.

16:24.817 --> 16:27.167
Fresh as a fucking daisy.

16:27.211 --> 16:29.161
Mr. Kamenov's representatives
ardue at 8:00 p.m....

16:29.185 --> 16:30.463
Why the fuck
do you think I'm here?

16:30.487 --> 16:32.479
Final inventory
red-flagged a piece,

16:32.503 --> 16:33.781
provenance is in question.

16:33.805 --> 16:35.167
I've got Christie's up my ass,

16:35.191 --> 16:36.973
with a fucking insurance team.

16:36.997 --> 16:38.737
Orders from Mr. Platov...
No one in or out.

16:38.761 --> 16:40.313
This is my freeport.

16:40.357 --> 16:42.917
We don't get this fixed,
it ain't worth squat.

16:44.515 --> 16:46.529
Empty your pockets.
I need to search you.

16:46.573 --> 16:49.931
All right, cop a good feel.

16:49.975 --> 16:51.779
It's been a while.

16:54.385 --> 16:57.575
We're good.

17:37.981 --> 17:41.423
Lost contact with the drone
10 miles south of Tapa.

17:41.467 --> 17:43.187
Signal was jammed.

17:43.231 --> 17:45.581
You were right, Valerie.

17:45.625 --> 17:47.785
Put an American V on their radar

17:47.809 --> 17:50.053
and like clockwork,
they bring it down.

17:50.077 --> 17:51.419
You think he'll buy it?

17:51.463 --> 17:52.993
We uploaded
our Baltic war games,

17:53.017 --> 17:54.443
the entire NATO brigade.

17:54.487 --> 17:56.227
Should give Platov
a hell of a fright.

17:56.251 --> 17:58.559
Thank you, B.B.

17:58.603 --> 17:59.965
This could be the difference.

17:59.989 --> 18:02.423
I owed you one.

18:30.271 --> 18:35.519
Three weeks ago, my clie
paid $3.27 million for this.

18:35.563 --> 18:39.173
Someone here fucked up.
Provenance is gone.

18:39.217 --> 18:42.239
You can wipe your ass with it
now.

18:42.283 --> 18:44.129
This vault has been sealed,
Blake.

18:44.173 --> 18:47.237
Word gets out even one of these
pieces is compromised,

18:47.281 --> 18:48.979
that makes them all forgeries,

18:49.003 --> 18:51.415
and that puts Roman's hands
around your throat!

18:51.439 --> 18:52.865
It's not a forgery, you kn that.

18:52.909 --> 18:54.755
It doesn't matter!

18:54.799 --> 18:58.073
A fucking rumor, a whisper,
it's over!

18:58.117 --> 19:00.067
Christie's bean-counters
are coming!

19:00.091 --> 19:02.125
They take one step
inside of here,

19:02.149 --> 19:03.847
we're on the hook
for the appraised value

19:03.871 --> 19:06.935
of every fucking thing in here!

19:06.979 --> 19:08.993
What do we do?

19:09.037 --> 19:11.891
We get it all out of here!
Alof it!

19:11.935 --> 19:14.285
To an independent vetter
before it's locked up

19:14.329 --> 19:16.805
for years of fucking
insurance litigation!

19:16.849 --> 19:20.165
We do it now, we get it straight
to Kamenov from there!

19:20.209 --> 19:21.571
Okay. I am gonna
need his permission.

19:21.595 --> 19:23.147
No signal in here!

19:23.191 --> 19:24.785
No reception, by design!

19:24.829 --> 19:26.801
Stupid bastard!
Use the landline!

19:26.845 --> 19:29.027
- W-Where is it?
- Back of the hangar.

19:29.071 --> 19:32.387
By the time you get there,
call Platov,

19:32.431 --> 19:34.571
have him rip your fucking head
off and get back to me,

19:34.615 --> 19:36.545
they'll fucking be here!

19:39.781 --> 19:42.047
All of it goes!

19:42.091 --> 19:44.483
All of it!
Move it out!

19:44.527 --> 19:47.171
Get every fucking last thing
out of here!

19:49.399 --> 19:51.833
You should be thanking me,
Anton.

19:51.877 --> 19:55.193
I just saved ur fucking life.

20:01.411 --> 20:02.963
Fuck.

20:55.591 --> 20:58.571
I'm supposed to believe
Roman Platov killed him.

20:58.615 --> 21:00.965
But I don'

21:01.009 --> 21:03.527
There is something else.

21:03.571 --> 21:06.551
Danny was looking so desperately
for s mother's killer.

21:13.777 --> 21:16.757
You're gonna tell me who he is
and where to find him.

21:16.801 --> 21:21.755
So secrets are better off
staying buried.

21:21.799 --> 21:26.291
If you're scared,
I can protect you.

21:30.367 --> 21:34.271
No one can protect me from
what I'm scared of,<i> Fraulein.</i>

21:34.315 --> 21:37.001
Secrets are all I have.

21:37.045 --> 21:39.311
Lies is what you have.

21:39.355 --> 21:41.641
You tell yourself
you played a pt in history,

21:41.665 --> 21:44.435
that you <i> are</i> history,
but that's shit.

21:44.479 --> 21:46.681
You were middle management.

21:46.705 --> 21:49.895
If not for me, you'd still be
in a Stasi uniform

21:49.939 --> 21:55.103
eavesdropping on your neighbors
or fetching coffee.

21:55.147 --> 21:59.849
Please.
I... I can't let this go.

22:01.867 --> 22:04.889
Well, in that case,

22:04.933 --> 22:06.779
I pity you.

22:09.805 --> 22:13.037
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I need to get cleaned up.

22:13.081 --> 22:14.801
I'm expecting company.

24:45.625 --> 24:47.765
Go right.

25:56.185 --> 25:58.241
Valerie, the camp is empty.

25:58.285 --> 25:59.627
They're on the move.

25:59.671 --> 26:02.273
I know where they're headed.

26:18.025 --> 26:21.677
30 enemy inside, scattered.

26:21.721 --> 26:23.587
Heat cluster
on the second floor.

26:23.611 --> 26:25.331
Those are the servers.

26:25.375 --> 26:27.241
Any of your people in there?

26:27.265 --> 26:28.523
Not likely.

26:28.567 --> 26:31.925
Can you get us in?

26:31.969 --> 26:33.815
Follow me.

26:36.127 --> 26:37.511
Go!

27:29.131 --> 27:31.187
Go.

27:39.253 --> 27:41.771
I always knew the servers
would be vulrable.

27:41.815 --> 27:43.367
I planned ahead.

27:43.411 --> 27:45.089
Backdoor.

27:45.133 --> 27:49.205
When we get there,
we won't have long.

27:49.249 --> 27:51.473
The Russians must have installed
a firewall by now.

27:51.517 --> 27:53.867
That means

27:53.911 --> 27:56.639
30 seconds after
I access the system,

27:56.683 --> 27:58.529
they'll know.

27:58.573 --> 28:01.679
They're gonna come for you.

28:01.723 --> 28:04.493
Five solid minutes.

28:04.537 --> 28:05.837
That's what I need.

28:05.881 --> 28:07.517
You have to keep them out.

28:07.561 --> 28:09.701
Five minutes,
you can put the lights on?

28:09.745 --> 28:13.313
And the Wi-Fi
and the cell towers.

28:13.357 --> 28:16.673
People will be able to organize.
They'll be able to fight back.

28:16.717 --> 28:18.395
We get the lights on,

28:18.439 --> 28:20.453
the cockroaches wi scatter,

28:20.497 --> 28:22.897
and we can take back
our country.

28:51.409 --> 28:53.255
[ Dialing ]

31:23.449 --> 31:25.505
Okay.

32:04.105 --> 32:05.447
Fuck.

32:05.491 --> 32:07.673
Fuck, fuck.

32:11.791 --> 32:13.511
We're losing containment!

32:13.555 --> 32:14.897
It's now or never!

34:41.983 --> 34:43.745
I'm American.

34:43.789 --> 34:45.971
I'm American.
- I need a medic over here now!

34:46.014 --> 34:47.670
- Get a medic in here!
- Come on, buddy.

34:47.695 --> 34:49.918
...It's all right.

34:53.574 --> 34:55.672
Dr. Adeyemi?

35:07.687 --> 35:09.953
I'm from the American Embassy.

35:09.997 --> 35:12.641
Just what we need,
another diplomat.

35:21.001 --> 35:23.119
Okay, I'm... I'm listening.

35:23.143 --> 35:25.451
Green cards and visas
to the United States,

35:25.495 --> 35:27.845
ready to be expedite
by me, personally.

35:27.889 --> 35:30.659
All they require
is your signature.

35:37.381 --> 35:39.395
I don't trust them.

35:39.439 --> 35:41.831
We'll arrange for you to live
close to Washington

35:41.875 --> 35:43.699
and make sure that you're
back to work very quickly,

35:43.723 --> 35:45.169
continuing your research.

35:45.193 --> 35:47.311
Additionally, we'll be
purchasing your device,

35:47.335 --> 35:50.063
which is already in our
possession, at a fair price.

35:50.107 --> 35:53.297
You want me make more weapons?

35:53.341 --> 35:55.627
We want you to further the
advances you've already made.

35:55.651 --> 35:59.555
What if I wanto invent
a technology that starts hearts

35:59.599 --> 36:01.571
rather than stops them?

36:01.615 --> 36:03.335
Wod I still be welcome?

36:03.379 --> 36:05.623
You knew what you were doing
when you invented the device.

36:05.647 --> 36:08.249
The hour is rather late
for a pang of conscience.

36:08.293 --> 36:11.273
Is is a one-time offer,
Dr. Adeyemi.

36:14.425 --> 36:16.229
And April?

36:16.273 --> 36:18.077
She's washed her hands of us.

36:18.121 --> 36:19.693
You have April to thank
for this.

36:19.717 --> 36:22.319
It would've gone
very differently without her.

36:22.363 --> 36:23.851
So when you see her
on the street in Georgetown,

36:23.875 --> 36:25.755
you may want to tip your hat.

36:39.331 --> 36:40.925
Good day.

36:43.993 --> 36:48.989
To the new route of the pipeline
and to our new partnership.

36:49.033 --> 36:51.173
Long may it last.

36:54.073 --> 36:57.347
There were others
soliciting my business,

36:57.391 --> 37:00.077
on the continent, in the States.

37:00.121 --> 37:02.933
And I had my pick.

37:02.977 --> 37:06.881
You know what sealed the deal?

37:06.925 --> 37:10.577
Uh, my unbeatable
intelligence network

37:10.621 --> 37:12.613
that nobody can
hold a candle to?

37:12.637 --> 37:15.617
...No?

37:15.661 --> 37:18.977
I asked around about you.

37:19.021 --> 37:24.479
Above all else in business,
I value loyalty.

37:24.523 --> 37:27.839
They say Steven Frost
is a man you can trust.

37:32.377 --> 37:34.727
Well, th... I'm deeply honored,
Susanne.

37:34.771 --> 37:36.575
Thank you.

37:36.619 --> 37:38.465
I'll be in touch.

37:40.735 --> 37:41.909
Thank you.

37:41.953 --> 37:44.303
Thank you.

38:29.371 --> 38:31.217
Sir?
Are you all right?

38:31.261 --> 38:33.337
- I'm fine. Fine.
F you want to call medic...

38:33.361 --> 38:35.291
No! I said I was fine,
for Christ's sake.

39:16.369 --> 39:20.315
Kolya...

39:20.359 --> 39:23.927
<i>privet patsan.</i>

39:27.919 --> 39:30.121
We're taking a trip, You and I.

39:30.145 --> 39:31.949
Sounds delightful.

39:31.993 --> 39:33.671
How should I pack?

39:33.715 --> 39:36.947
Light.

39:36.991 --> 39:39.467
Linen, then.

39:39.511 --> 39:41.945
I'll just get my passport.

39:45.433 --> 39:49.253
Or the pistol
Yresting beside it..

39:58.201 --> 40:01.517
If I h taken Estonia?

40:01.561 --> 40:06.095
He's waiting on us now.

40:16.471 --> 40:18.737
Giddy up, cowboy.

40:18.781 --> 40:20.963
Let's ride.

40:27.853 --> 40:30.959
I... I hadn't been in the dacha
for 10 minutes

40:31.003 --> 40:34.277
when this group of armed men
opened fire

40:34.321 --> 40:36.061
and I had to
get the hell out of there.

40:36.085 --> 40:40.283
Didn't even see Daniel.

40:40.327 --> 40:42.131
What about Hector?

40:42.175 --> 40:44.567
He called me yesterday.

40:44.611 --> 40:46.309
Said he was gonna
do you a solid,

40:46.333 --> 40:48.813
then he wanted you to
lose his number.

40:50.743 --> 40:53.303
Oh, God.

40:53.347 --> 40:55.907
I wish this all could've ended
differently.

40:55.951 --> 40:58.679
I just...

40:58.723 --> 41:01.451
You did everything you could.

41:01.495 --> 41:02.963
We all did.

41:03.007 --> 41:04.181
Yep.

41:04.225 --> 41:06.239
You know...

41:06.283 --> 41:08.591
Steven?

41:11.449 --> 41:13.799
You said you were in and out of
Komarovo quite quickly,

41:13.843 --> 41:16.235
yet you didn't call me bk
until today.

41:16.279 --> 41:18.335
Why is that?

41:18.379 --> 41:20.665
Uh, you were right, Valerie.

41:20.689 --> 41:23.669
I'm too old to be in the field.

41:23.713 --> 41:26.041
I was picked up
by a Russian patrol,

41:26.065 --> 41:29.633
and I had toall in
all of my local favors

41:29.677 --> 41:33.035
just to walk out of those doors.

41:33.079 --> 41:36.311
I should've l.

41:39.001 --> 41:41.687
Do you mind if I ask you
another question?

41:46.813 --> 41:53.573
Becae of your example
and your friendship,

41:53.617 --> 41:57.017
it meant so much to Daniel.

41:57.061 --> 42:00.167
Would you speak at his memo?

42:07.477 --> 42:09.617
Of course.

42:14.449 --> 42:16.883
<i>In Estonia,
life is returning to normal</i>

42:16.927 --> 42:19.109
<i>after an attempted coup
was foiled.</i>

42:19.153 --> 42:21.503

42:57.835 --> 43:00.899
Ooh.

43:00.943 --> 43:03.671
Look who I found.

43:03.715 --> 43:07.115
Damn.

43:07.159 --> 43:10.223
It's nice to see a friendly.

43:10.267 --> 43:12.995
They keeping you
for the psych eval?

43:18.331 --> 43:21.311
Daniel's gone.

43:21.355 --> 43:23.831
My career's over,

43:23.875 --> 43:27.737
the career I threw my family
away for.

43:27.781 --> 43:32.357
I'll be luy to get my job back
in Berlin.

43:32.401 --> 43:37.733
Last woman I thought liked me
was a Russian operative.

43:37.777 --> 43:41.807
You're forgetting
the most important part.

43:45.589 --> 43:48.737
We won and they lost.

43:48.781 --> 43:52.811
Think about what that means.

43:52.855 --> 43:55.751
You know how many lives
we would've lost

43:55.795 --> 43:59.027
if we allowed another war
to break out in Europe

43:59.071 --> 44:01.967
and what could've happened?

44:02.011 --> 44:04.339
And the people of Estonia
are free.

44:04.363 --> 44:07.259
That wasn't a given.

44:07.303 --> 44:10.451
It could've played
completely differently.

44:13.015 --> 44:18.263
We all have nicks,
we all have scars.

44:18.307 --> 44:22.799
We do our best,
and then we pray.

44:22.843 --> 44:27.503
We pray that it was worth it.

44:27.547 --> 44:30.233
And this time, it was.

44:57.409 --> 45:00.515
Right on time.

45:04.927 --> 45:06.227
Uh, you want a drink?

45:06.271 --> 45:09.083
No.

45:09.127 --> 45:12.443
Mnh-mnh.

45:12.487 --> 45:15.509
You know, I've been trying to
find a way not to do this, Gil.

45:15.553 --> 45:17.735
You know I have.

45:17.779 --> 45:20.675
I've given you
chance after chance.

45:20.719 --> 45:22.901
Sorry.

45:22.945 --> 45:26.345
I was never any good
at doing what I was told.

45:26.389 --> 45:30.419
Yeah, well, you put me in
quite a spot, old friend.

45:30.463 --> 45:33.989
'Cause we both know that you're
not making that last podcast.

45:34.033 --> 45:37.307
There he is.

45:37.351 --> 45:40.877
It's good to see you again.

45:40.921 --> 45:42.683
It's been a long time.

45:42.727 --> 45:44.383
You're losing it, pal.

45:44.407 --> 45:45.433
I was here last week.

45:45.457 --> 45:47.051
No.

45:47.095 --> 45:49.739
Steven Frost was here last week.

45:49.783 --> 45:53.939
Steven Frost
with the aw-shucks grin

45:53.983 --> 45:58.601
and the fancy fucking suit.

45:58.645 --> 46:03.179
No. This te,
you've come back as Diver.

46:05.743 --> 46:09.017
You took his mother's life,

46:09.061 --> 46:11.369
then you took his.

46:11.413 --> 46:13.343
Didn't you?

46:13.387 --> 46:16.157
To save your own skin.

46:16.201 --> 46:18.131
Again.

46:20.401 --> 46:22.583
Fuck you

46:22.627 --> 46:25.985
and your goddamn loose ends.

46:26.029 --> 46:29.975
Esther Krug and Daniel Miller,

46:30.019 --> 46:32.201
they were almost happy.

46:32.245 --> 46:34.637
It was rig there in their grasp.

46:34.681 --> 46:37.871
Just like you and Kelly.

46:40.099 --> 46:42.827
Why are you the one
who gets it all?

46:57.403 --> 47:00.425
I have nothing left.

47:00.469 --> 47:02.231
Go ahead.

47:02.275 --> 47:04.835
Send me to Valhalla.

47:21.301 --> 47:24.827
No. Fuck.

47:27.433 --> 47:29.321
Fuck!

47:50.365 --> 47:52.253
Come on, do it.

47:52.297 --> 47:54.395
Do it.

47:54.439 --> 47:57.629
Gil...

48:08.341 --> 48:10.061
Unh-unh.

48:10.105 --> 48:11.783
No.

48:11.827 --> 48:13.883
You don't get off that easy.

48:15.691 --> 48:19.091
All the blood on your hands,
it's gonna stay there.

48:19.135 --> 48:22.325
And I hope you burn
for what you've done.

48:22.369 --> 48:26.189
Yeah.

48:26.233 --> 48:29.549
And what about you, Gil?

48:29.593 --> 48:31.565
What about your part?

48:31.609 --> 48:34.169
Me?

48:34.213 --> 48:40.049
I gave my life in defense of
the United States of America.

48:42.403 --> 48:45.593
I am forgiven.

49:03.487 --> 49:07.517
What is the measure of a man?

49:07.561 --> 49:11.213
The quantity and grade
of courage in his heart?

49:11.257 --> 49:15.161
The sureness of his word,

49:15.205 --> 49:18.983
the faith in his work,

49:19.027 --> 49:22.259
in his fellows?

49:22.303 --> 49:25.073
Well, by that standard,

49:25.117 --> 49:28.265
Daniel was an extraordinary man.

49:28.309 --> 49:31.247
He sacrificed his life
for freedom.

49:31.291 --> 49:36.329
Not the word, not the idea,
but the absolute reality of it.

49:36.373 --> 49:40.277
His actions and yours,
who supported him,

49:40.321 --> 49:44.519
sad millions from
the jackboot of oppression.

49:44.563 --> 49:50.231
Hell, he might've even
saved NATO itself.

49:50.275 --> 49:56.069
This honorable man
with a crystalline...

50:05.983 --> 50:09.719
...with a crystalline
sense of duty.

50:09.763 --> 50:12.617
He pursued the truth
like no other.

50:12.619 --> 50:16.481
But that's our calling, our
vocation, to pursue the truth,

50:16.525 --> 50:20.093
He pursued the truth
to safeguard it, to deliver it

50:20.137 --> 50:23.159
pure and undiluted
to the president.

50:29.293 --> 50:31.475
Daniel...

51:04.489 --> 51:06.125
You all right?

51:06.169 --> 51:08.351
Yeah.

51:08.395 --> 51:10.619
I'm good, yeah.

51:10.663 --> 51:12.887
I'm sorry.

51:12.931 --> 51:15.155
Sorry.

51:15.199 --> 51:19.481
Daniel...

51:19.525 --> 51:26.159
may the truth that you
so nobly served set you free.

51:31.075 --> 51:32.417
Thank you.

51:45.985 --> 51:49.469
Esther, I'm so sorry.

51:49.513 --> 51:52.157
Thank you for your words,
Steven.

51:52.201 --> 51:56.987
I promise I will remember them.

51:57.031 --> 51:59.381
Always.
