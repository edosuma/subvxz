WEBVTT

00:12.000 --> 00:14.375
I do not believe you.

00:19.416 --> 00:22.416
You are telling us a load of garbage
and you know it.

00:25.125 --> 00:28.125
No one who was innocent
would get rid of the fingerprints.

00:28.208 --> 00:31.500
Instead, you could've just picked up
the phone and called the police.

00:40.541 --> 00:44.541
The truth is that you were
the ones who killed Gambino

00:45.041 --> 00:47.666
when you found out
he was sleeping with your wife.

00:49.125 --> 00:51.458
The television in need of repairing.

00:52.041 --> 00:54.583
The discovering of Gambino's body.

00:54.666 --> 00:56.791
Then there's the workers fixing the tiles.

00:56.875 --> 00:59.000
And the Mafia kidnapping you two.

00:59.500 --> 01:00.916
You're full of it.

01:02.333 --> 01:04.166
You're up to your neck in it.

01:04.666 --> 01:06.625
This murder was premeditated.

01:06.708 --> 01:08.750
That's at least 30 years
in prison for you.

01:08.833 --> 01:12.291
We got a parking ticket
taken care of as well that day.

01:12.375 --> 01:15.458
And we burnt the bag with the rags
and the cleaning supplies.

01:15.541 --> 01:16.750
How clever!

01:17.666 --> 01:19.916
Bribing a public official.

01:20.000 --> 01:22.708
Concealing and tampering with evidence.

01:24.125 --> 01:25.333
And we can't forget

01:26.083 --> 01:29.416
attempting to extort information
from the deputy police chief.

01:29.500 --> 01:32.833
- Agata, just listen--
- Call me Deputy Police Chief Scalia.

01:34.416 --> 01:35.500
Let's break for now.

01:36.458 --> 01:37.541
Take them out there

01:37.625 --> 01:39.750
while we wait for the prosecutor's office.

01:50.041 --> 01:52.750
Scalia, don't blame yourself
for what happened here.

01:54.291 --> 01:57.500
I do think that you should be
taken off of the case from now on.

01:58.333 --> 02:01.958
Considering the history between yourself
and the two suspects here,

02:02.541 --> 02:04.583
it might just cloud your judgment.

02:05.500 --> 02:08.541
I'm going to visit
this monastery in Castelmonte

02:08.625 --> 02:10.958
and see what this wife of his
has to tell us.

02:12.000 --> 02:15.250
- Assuming she's alive.
- Of course she's still alive.

02:15.750 --> 02:19.541
There's no way those two
have it in them to kill anyone at all.

02:19.625 --> 02:21.791
I've known them both
since we were in high school.

02:23.458 --> 02:25.333
Ah, my dear deputy.

02:28.625 --> 02:30.458
We change over time.

03:09.916 --> 03:12.875
I'll bet you 100 euros
those two are guilty?

03:14.500 --> 03:16.416
- Hmm?
- All right, you got it.

03:17.166 --> 03:19.458
Ugh, your hand's all sweaty.

03:27.750 --> 03:29.750
Congratulations.
You did a great job.

03:29.833 --> 03:33.083
Agata, I want you to know
I still would've taken you out to dinner.

03:33.166 --> 03:34.041
You liar.

03:34.125 --> 03:37.208
- You just did it so you could spy on me.
- That's not true.

03:37.291 --> 03:41.000
Do you know how often I've thought
about being with you in the cupboard?

03:41.083 --> 03:43.541
And how we kissed each other. Do you?

03:44.333 --> 03:48.000
- You're ridiculous. That means you too.
- But… But…

03:48.083 --> 03:49.875
Agata, I did it for my mom.

03:49.958 --> 03:52.333
- They're very dangerous people.
- Yeah, okay.

03:52.916 --> 03:56.000
Holy Father had already given
the order to kill us.

03:57.750 --> 03:59.041
What did you just say?

04:07.083 --> 04:08.041
Any day?

04:11.250 --> 04:12.125
No, huh?

04:14.375 --> 04:18.125
Perhaps you are not aware
of the amount of trouble you are in.

04:18.208 --> 04:20.208
- No. Ye-- yes…

04:21.250 --> 04:25.500
Our deputy is kind enough to give you
really your only way out.

04:28.750 --> 04:30.875
With that said, look again.

04:31.875 --> 04:33.708
Is that the Holy Father?

04:33.791 --> 04:36.791
Listen, Mr. Prosecutor,
we've already told you.

04:36.875 --> 04:40.291
He's too young in this photo, and we
can't see anything because it's blurry.

04:40.375 --> 04:42.916
And this one here,
that you've done with a computer…

04:43.000 --> 04:45.958
- It's not really jogging any memories.
- That's right.

04:46.041 --> 04:48.125
We only ever saw
the Holy Father in the dark,

04:48.208 --> 04:49.958
turned around while he was cooking.

04:51.000 --> 04:52.500
Have you got another photo?

04:52.583 --> 04:54.958
You got any shots from behind
while he's cooking?

04:55.041 --> 04:58.375
If we had another one in our possession,
don't you think you'd have seen it?

04:59.166 --> 05:00.791
Geez, we're just asking.

05:00.875 --> 05:02.541
And the question was stupid.

05:02.625 --> 05:03.708
Sorry.

05:05.416 --> 05:07.291
- This one…

05:07.375 --> 05:09.000
…was his First Communion.

05:09.083 --> 05:11.500
It's the only photo we've managed to get.

05:14.250 --> 05:16.583
We should be grateful we've even got this.

05:18.166 --> 05:20.250
He's a very sly fellow.

05:22.458 --> 05:23.916
He never leaves a trace.

05:25.625 --> 05:28.625
He's been making fun of the State
for years now!

05:30.458 --> 05:32.125
Maybe you should get more photos.

05:32.208 --> 05:33.416
No, that's enough now.

05:33.500 --> 05:34.375
That's it!

05:34.458 --> 05:36.583
Either everything you've said is real

05:37.083 --> 05:39.208
and you're two giant idiots,

05:39.291 --> 05:41.291
who are trapped…

05:41.375 --> 05:43.750
…in a web that's much bigger than you are,

05:44.666 --> 05:47.500
or it's this is all fictional stories…

05:50.666 --> 05:52.250
and the two of you are killers.

05:53.541 --> 05:54.666
Ha.

05:57.750 --> 05:58.666
Have another look.

06:00.833 --> 06:03.041
Imagine he's turned away… and in the dark.

06:03.125 --> 06:04.500
- While he's cooking.
- Of course.

06:05.250 --> 06:06.333
Get them out of here!

06:07.375 --> 06:08.291
They're under arrest,

06:08.375 --> 06:10.583
and I don't want
to see them in here again, okay?

06:11.375 --> 06:14.041
Prosecutor,
we've been chasing him for 50 years.

06:14.125 --> 06:15.291
This is the closest we've ever gotten.

06:15.375 --> 06:17.125
Oh, we're close then?

06:17.208 --> 06:18.541
With these two idiots?

06:18.625 --> 06:22.000
Well, all right then.
Do me a favor and get them out of here.

06:22.083 --> 06:25.250
I don't wanna see them. Get them out
of my sight. Get them away! Go! Go! Go!

06:25.916 --> 06:28.708
Ugh! Now I've seen it all. Ha!

06:32.416 --> 06:33.666
Hold on a second.

06:37.125 --> 06:38.541
You believe us, don't you?

06:38.625 --> 06:40.291
I shouldn't tell you this.

06:40.791 --> 06:43.166
I hate to say
I'm dumb enough to believe you.

06:44.166 --> 06:46.500
Unfortunately, what I think
holds no weight.

06:46.583 --> 06:48.583
What's going to happen to us?

06:49.875 --> 06:51.208
What do you think?

07:01.250 --> 07:02.750
Will you stop wailing?

07:03.250 --> 07:04.375
Wailing?

07:04.458 --> 07:08.416
You were complaining your life was boring.
Is this a more exciting life for you?

07:08.500 --> 07:11.500
What's that got to do with anything?
This is because we were making things up

07:11.583 --> 07:13.958
as we went along.
Not like in <i>The Touch of the Killer</i> ,

07:14.041 --> 07:16.291
where every little thing
is planned out very well,

07:16.375 --> 07:18.583
thought out very well, and done well.

07:19.083 --> 07:20.125
Are you an idiot?

07:20.208 --> 07:23.291
Every newspaper is going
to have our name in the headlines.

07:23.375 --> 07:25.625
They'll all think
that we are the real killers.

07:25.708 --> 07:27.458
Then the Mafia will find out the truth

07:27.541 --> 07:31.666
and, for vengeance, will kill my mom
and my sister. Your wife is dead.

07:34.416 --> 07:35.583
I hadn't thought of that.

07:35.666 --> 07:39.083
Whatever. You'll have plenty of time
to think about it in here.

07:39.958 --> 07:41.750
This whole thing is your fault.

07:45.875 --> 07:48.333
- You're right. I messed it up.
- You did.

07:48.833 --> 07:53.250
If I hadn't been obsessed with having
a life full of adventures and surprises,

07:53.750 --> 07:56.666
I might have noticed
what was happening with Ester earlier.

07:57.208 --> 07:58.291
It's my fault.

07:58.375 --> 07:59.916
This doesn't excuse Ester.

08:00.000 --> 08:02.333
- Huh?
- No, come on, Valentino.

08:02.416 --> 08:04.083
You know I led her to it.

08:05.041 --> 08:07.666
All day, sat in front of those TV shows…

08:08.458 --> 08:11.541
The worst part is that now
she's in danger, and it's my fault.

08:12.375 --> 08:15.750
Hmm. Maybe, if that's the case,
I'm no better than you.

08:16.625 --> 08:18.375
I've never had a backbone.

08:18.458 --> 08:20.083
I'm always following others.

08:20.166 --> 08:21.625
Like you and my mother.

08:21.708 --> 08:23.541
I've been a follower my whole life.

08:24.041 --> 08:26.000
That's why I still live with my mother.

08:27.583 --> 08:30.750
Eh, all right,
but it's still down to the TV series.

08:31.333 --> 08:33.666
They had me disassociate from reality.

08:33.750 --> 08:35.458
- A bit.
- A bit?

08:35.541 --> 08:37.625
You're not a friend of mine
if you just say a bit.

08:37.708 --> 08:39.375
Okay? You're no friend of mine.

08:39.458 --> 08:41.375
Imagine if I start another TV show.

08:41.458 --> 08:44.208
I want you to take the TV
and smash it right over my head.

08:44.291 --> 08:45.291
Calm down, Salvo.

08:45.375 --> 08:46.416
Are we kidding me?

08:46.500 --> 08:48.375
All day with<i> The Touch of the Killer.</i>

08:48.458 --> 08:51.583
What would the killer do? What would
the killer do? What would the killer do?

08:51.666 --> 08:52.875
Oh.

08:52.958 --> 08:54.541
Are you kidding me right now?

09:03.208 --> 09:04.875
What are you thinking about?

09:06.333 --> 09:09.125
I may have come up
with a solution for us after all.

09:09.708 --> 09:12.333
One solution we hadn't considered
before right now.

09:12.416 --> 09:15.541
The main thing is that you don't go back
to thinking, "What would the killer do?"

09:15.625 --> 09:18.250
"What would the killer do?
What would the killer do?"

09:18.333 --> 09:21.958
No, but I can tell you
exactly the plan of Inspector Jackson.

09:22.791 --> 09:24.458
What? Are you crazy? No!

09:24.541 --> 09:25.958
What? Are you crazy?

09:26.041 --> 09:28.958
I said the same thing too,
but if you let him explain it…

09:29.041 --> 09:30.458
What's to explain? Hmm?

09:30.541 --> 09:32.541
Two civilians infiltrating the Mafia?

09:32.625 --> 09:34.750
Sir, please, would you
just shut this thing down?

09:35.833 --> 09:37.041
What was that series called?

09:37.750 --> 09:39.791
<i>The Touch of the Killer.</i>

09:40.291 --> 09:43.500
<i>The Touch of the Killer.</i>

09:44.916 --> 09:46.458
If you really think about it,

09:46.541 --> 09:49.583
we're extremely lucky to have two people
here that the Holy Father trusts.

09:49.666 --> 09:51.333
If you don't mind me saying,

09:52.000 --> 09:53.791
if it gets out that we, uh,

09:53.875 --> 09:57.375
used civilians
for a dangerous operation like this,

09:57.458 --> 09:59.583
the public wouldn't approve.

09:59.666 --> 10:02.708
Well, the public would love it
if we finally brought the Holy Father down.

10:03.291 --> 10:04.750
But with people like that,

10:04.833 --> 10:08.125
it takes just one hair out of place
at the wrong moment and then…

10:08.208 --> 10:09.875
Just believe me. I know these two.

10:09.958 --> 10:11.708
They can't handle the tension.

10:11.791 --> 10:13.791
We handled it just fine the first time.

10:13.875 --> 10:15.916
And we'll handle it
just fine this time too.

10:16.000 --> 10:18.375
If you're doing this
to fix things between us, it won't work.

10:19.291 --> 10:21.500
You know that I'd do anything for you.

10:22.000 --> 10:23.833
My God, if he isn't just the sweetest.

10:25.208 --> 10:26.875
But I'm choosing to do this for me.

10:28.583 --> 10:30.125
We need to take every precaution.

10:30.208 --> 10:31.708
And if we're going through with this,

10:31.791 --> 10:35.166
then the plan needs to be secure
before we can go forward.

10:35.750 --> 10:37.250
- There's one problem.
- What?

10:37.333 --> 10:39.625
- My mama.
- Do you wanna bring her too?

10:39.708 --> 10:40.541
No.

10:40.625 --> 10:45.083
My mom still has no idea
that we "killed" Ester.

10:45.166 --> 10:47.000
My mom thinks Ester is still alive.

10:47.083 --> 10:50.333
But Ester can't go back home and be alive,

10:50.416 --> 10:52.708
because if the Mafia sees her living,

10:52.791 --> 10:55.583
they'll kill her
because they'll know that she's not dead.

10:55.666 --> 10:56.875
Is that clear?

11:02.000 --> 11:03.458
Whatever. I get it.

11:06.291 --> 11:10.375
No, no, no, Mom, I'm over it all.
I'm done with Salvo.

11:10.458 --> 11:11.583
He's a bad guy.

11:11.666 --> 11:13.916
<i>Don't bother thinking about that now.</i>

11:14.500 --> 11:17.208
You belong here
with your brother and mother.

11:17.291 --> 11:20.875
And from tomorrow on,
we'll have cake for breakfast,

11:20.958 --> 11:22.500
<i>all three of us together.</i>

11:22.583 --> 11:24.875
<i>Happy, just like the old days.</i>

11:24.958 --> 11:29.791
Uh… I just… At this moment,
I need space, you know?

11:29.875 --> 11:30.791
<i>Why?</i>

11:30.875 --> 11:34.000
Listen. I'll cook you
all of your favorite dishes.

11:34.083 --> 11:36.666
<i>I'll make you an excellent buck wheat.</i>

11:36.750 --> 11:38.541
<i>I know that's one of your favorites.</i>

11:38.625 --> 11:42.583
I'll make you vegan burgers.
Oh, I make excellent vegan burgers!

11:42.666 --> 11:45.916
Uh, Mom, I need to go see my, uh…

11:47.916 --> 11:49.250
<i>Well, him…</i>

11:49.333 --> 11:51.708
You know how I'm saying.

11:52.291 --> 11:54.291
Oh, so it's not finished then?

11:54.375 --> 11:56.833
You've reignited the flame.

11:57.416 --> 11:59.000
You made the right choice.

11:59.083 --> 12:01.000
<i>He deserves the cheating.</i>

12:01.500 --> 12:02.708
<i>No, Mom.</i>

12:03.208 --> 12:06.000
<i>Actually,</i> <i>if you really wanna know,</i>

12:07.708 --> 12:09.125
I really regret it.

12:10.375 --> 12:12.750
<i>What have you</i>
<i>possibly got to regret?</i>

12:12.833 --> 12:15.875
Any man who hits his wife
deserves this and more.

12:16.625 --> 12:20.541
Look, you were right.
Mom, I deserve a much better husband.

12:21.041 --> 12:24.875
Listen to me.
Return here and I'll report him for you.

12:24.958 --> 12:27.625
Don't you worry now. He'll go to jail.

12:29.125 --> 12:32.083
Look, I just need you
to cover for me about this trip

12:32.166 --> 12:36.416
because I lied to Salvo and told him
I was gonna be away at a yoga retreat.

12:36.500 --> 12:39.250
And he believed you?
He's a buffoon.

12:40.333 --> 12:43.041
<i>All right, I'll cover for you.</i>

12:43.125 --> 12:45.166
<i>But then come back</i>
<i>and we'll report him.</i>

12:45.250 --> 12:47.125
No, no, no, no, no. Not yet.

12:47.625 --> 12:49.000
I was talking with my lawyer.

12:49.083 --> 12:52.416
It's important we don't rush
and spend our time building a solid case.

12:52.500 --> 12:55.750
For now, we need to make sure
he doesn't suspect anything.

12:55.833 --> 12:59.375
Actually, I'm gonna need you
to start treating him better than before.

12:59.958 --> 13:01.791
Do you know what you're asking me to do?

13:01.875 --> 13:03.916
He's a monster!

13:04.000 --> 13:05.416
<i>How can I do that?</i>

13:05.500 --> 13:07.833
And you know how I'm a terrible liar.

13:09.166 --> 13:13.500
The code name we'll be using for
this mission will be the Holy Jailbird.

13:15.541 --> 13:18.416
We'll organize dinner at Valentino's house.

13:19.500 --> 13:22.125
We know that they gave him
a cell phone to listen in.

13:22.625 --> 13:25.958
He has to turn it on when he's with Agata
because they ordered him to.

13:26.916 --> 13:28.916
Salvo darling?

13:29.000 --> 13:30.708
Hurry while the pasta is fresh.

13:30.791 --> 13:33.625
Now what they don't know
is that we all know.

13:33.708 --> 13:35.541
And that's a big advantage for us.

13:36.583 --> 13:37.416
Ha!

13:37.500 --> 13:40.666
<i>Obviously, Mrs. Antonietta</i>
<i>will be completely in the dark.</i>

13:40.750 --> 13:42.500
- Salvo darling.
- There you go.

13:43.291 --> 13:46.083
I hope that you will enjoy the cooking.

13:46.166 --> 13:48.416
- Yes, that's good. Thank you. Thank you.
- Ah.

13:48.500 --> 13:50.166
Well, it looks delicious. Really.

13:50.250 --> 13:51.791
It's not just for looking at.

13:51.875 --> 13:54.041
I didn't mean to offend you. Sorry.

13:54.125 --> 13:56.458
Don't worry. She's always like that.

13:56.541 --> 14:00.666
When I introduce her to a lady, she does
everything in her power to keep us apart.

14:00.750 --> 14:04.458
Valentino, what in the world
are you talking about? I, um…

14:04.541 --> 14:07.916
Yeah, sweetheart, you shouldn't
talk that way to your mother.

14:08.000 --> 14:09.833
I didn't tell any lies. It's true.

14:09.916 --> 14:12.041
It was the same with Salvo. You remember?

14:12.125 --> 14:14.791
When he was just my friend,
everything was all right.

14:14.875 --> 14:18.208
But as soon as he got together with Ester,
it was the end of the world.

14:18.291 --> 14:22.500
Why would say awful things like that
to your mother? It's uncalled for.

14:22.583 --> 14:24.333
Just ignore him, Mom.

14:25.000 --> 14:26.750
Is it okay if I call you Mom?

14:28.416 --> 14:30.583
Valentino, have you gone insane?

14:30.666 --> 14:33.750
Yes, Mom, I'm crazy now,
but I do still love you.

14:33.833 --> 14:35.125
<i>Can I get a little more…</i>

14:35.208 --> 14:37.000
Hey, you need to take over now.

14:37.083 --> 14:39.333
Hold on. These just arrived.

14:39.416 --> 14:41.083
They're mussels straight from Messina.

14:41.166 --> 14:43.750
And if I don't clean them,
who will buy them?

14:43.833 --> 14:45.291
- One for you?
- No.

14:45.375 --> 14:46.708
<i>Will Ester be here soon?</i>

14:46.791 --> 14:48.666
I was hoping we could catch up.

14:48.750 --> 14:51.000
You can bring up Ester. In fact, you must.

14:51.083 --> 14:52.125
What if the Mafioso guys--

14:52.208 --> 14:55.208
Mafioso will just think that you're
making an excuse to your mother

14:55.291 --> 14:58.708
to cover up the fact that you…
…that you killed her.

14:58.791 --> 14:59.750
Ah.

15:01.208 --> 15:04.791
Uh, she went to go to, uh, do yoga.
Yeah, yoga.

15:05.375 --> 15:07.083
- Huh.
- Well, you know what they say.

15:07.166 --> 15:10.416
Spending time apart will make
the heart grow fonder. It's true.

15:10.500 --> 15:11.541
Yeah. Yeah.

15:11.625 --> 15:12.958
- Oh.

15:13.041 --> 15:15.791
You wait here.
I've gotta get something out of the oven.

15:15.875 --> 15:17.000
You all, eat.

15:17.791 --> 15:18.750
Be right back.

15:20.958 --> 15:25.666
A crucial element of the operation,
it needs to look like Mrs. Scalia

15:26.250 --> 15:28.250
is deeply in love with Valentino.

15:28.750 --> 15:31.583
A woman in love, um,

15:31.666 --> 15:34.583
is more likely to spill secrets, right?
She opens up.

15:34.666 --> 15:37.375
That seems like
a lot of information to give away.

15:37.458 --> 15:39.208
Agata, sweetheart,

15:39.291 --> 15:40.916
you look tired.

15:42.708 --> 15:44.000
You're right.

15:44.500 --> 15:45.625
My sweetheart.

15:46.125 --> 15:48.916
This whole thing with Gambino
is really talking a toll.

15:52.958 --> 15:55.750
But why would Gambino turn himself in?

15:56.333 --> 15:58.875
<i>Gambino's collaboration</i>
<i>with us was arranged</i>

15:58.958 --> 16:03.250
by a group of the Mafia circle
that is ready to betray Holy Father.

16:03.333 --> 16:07.250
They consider him a villain
that is drunk on money and power.

16:09.333 --> 16:11.375
What you're trying to tell us is,

16:11.458 --> 16:14.125
that hiding in the ranks
of the inner Mafia,

16:14.208 --> 16:16.000
there's someone who…

16:16.083 --> 16:16.958
And?

16:17.041 --> 16:20.000
There's a person inside
betraying Holy Father.

16:20.083 --> 16:21.625
Damn!

16:24.000 --> 16:27.125
We need to tell them things
that they are aware of

16:27.208 --> 16:30.208
and we combine the info
with something they don't know.

16:30.291 --> 16:33.791
Information that we,
uh, want them to believe.

16:33.875 --> 16:36.750
Gambino wasn't killed by Holy Father.

16:36.833 --> 16:39.750
We know because he had
no idea about this collaboration.

16:39.833 --> 16:42.041
It was probably a crime of passion,

16:42.125 --> 16:44.666
considering
the large numbers of lovers he had.

16:46.041 --> 16:50.416
Basically, Holy Father just got very lucky
when Gambino was killed.

16:50.916 --> 16:53.166
<i>But in spite of the accountant's death,</i>

16:54.291 --> 16:57.333
the plan for us to arrest
the Holy Father remains.

16:57.416 --> 16:59.333
So then the Holy Father is…

17:00.833 --> 17:06.708
So then the Holy Father is still
at risk of getting caught and arrested?

17:07.208 --> 17:08.666
Dang!

17:09.875 --> 17:10.791
Yes.

17:10.875 --> 17:13.541
We've got one of his trusted men inside.

17:13.625 --> 17:17.208
It's someone who he'll never suspect.

17:18.125 --> 17:22.708
Someone who is quietly acting
on behalf of a part of <i>Cosa Nostra</i>

17:22.791 --> 17:26.041
<i>that is going to get the boss</i>
<i>put in prison.</i>

17:27.708 --> 17:29.416
Dang!

17:30.375 --> 17:33.083
The question is who, sweetheart?

17:33.666 --> 17:34.625
Uh, no.

17:35.291 --> 17:37.416
That is confidential,

17:38.083 --> 17:39.125
my sweetheart.

17:40.875 --> 17:42.083
You carry on.

17:44.291 --> 17:45.875
<i>Here we are.</i>

17:45.958 --> 17:49.125
- Fresh out of the oven for you.
- Mm.

17:49.208 --> 17:51.083
My famous cake.

17:51.666 --> 17:54.750
- You put ricotta in that, didn't you?
- Yes!

18:01.500 --> 18:05.041
<i>We know that Holy Father</i>
<i>is obsessed with betrayal.</i>

18:06.750 --> 18:09.750
He suffers
from a real fear of persecution.

18:09.833 --> 18:12.125
Holy Father, I pray that you're joking?

18:12.708 --> 18:14.541
I would never betray you.

18:14.625 --> 18:16.666
You're deeply offending my honor.

18:17.166 --> 18:18.458
You didn't stutter,

18:18.541 --> 18:23.708
so that means that you are the only person
who I can really trust here.

18:23.791 --> 18:28.083
Although, you'll always be
a useless thing.

18:28.166 --> 18:29.000
Thank you.

18:29.083 --> 18:33.333
And when you get called in
by Tonino Macaluso…

18:33.416 --> 18:37.666
…you have to pretend
to want to get out of this whole thing.

18:37.750 --> 18:39.375
But you need to be very convincing.

18:39.458 --> 18:41.916
No. No. No.

18:42.000 --> 18:43.208
And no again.

18:43.708 --> 18:45.250
We had an agreement here.

18:45.333 --> 18:49.625
Kill my wife, spy on the cop, then…
we all go our separate ways.

18:49.708 --> 18:52.583
What fucking agreement
are you trying to talk to me about?

18:53.125 --> 18:55.208
You're gonna tell me
the name of that no-good traitor

18:55.291 --> 18:58.083
who wants to make sure
the Holy Father gets caught by the police.

18:58.166 --> 18:59.750
At which point in time,

19:01.125 --> 19:03.958
you have to be good with your acting.

19:04.041 --> 19:05.541
You have to perform.

19:07.000 --> 19:09.625
Your performance should be
Academy Award winning.

19:09.708 --> 19:10.958
It's so convenient.

19:11.041 --> 19:13.541
You're making it too convenient and easy.

19:13.625 --> 19:16.416
Too convenient, too easy,
and too simple as well.

19:16.500 --> 19:18.083
He could do this all day.

19:18.166 --> 19:20.625
And after we find out,
you expect us to kill him.

19:21.375 --> 19:23.958
Let's just say
if you're not willing to do this for me,

19:24.041 --> 19:26.458
I'll shoot you and then I'll shoot him
and then his mother.

19:26.541 --> 19:29.250
Or would that be
too convenient, easy, and simple for you?

19:29.333 --> 19:30.708
That's too convincing.

19:30.791 --> 19:32.750
They'll feel reassured after this.

19:33.500 --> 19:36.208
And in the meantime, Holy Father…

19:37.291 --> 19:39.625
…will become more and more impatient.

19:42.166 --> 19:43.208
Peppe.

19:50.833 --> 19:52.875
Holy Father sends his regards.

20:07.041 --> 20:09.125
One thing is here is for sure.

20:09.208 --> 20:11.250
After this last death that we witnessed,

20:11.333 --> 20:15.916
we can officially declare
that a new Mafia war is now upon us.

20:21.583 --> 20:24.541
<i> Well, come on.</i>
<i>Shall we go for a nice walk?</i>

20:25.291 --> 20:27.041
<i>Where do you wanna take me?</i>

20:27.125 --> 20:28.416
<i>Oh, anywhere.</i>

20:28.500 --> 20:30.958
<i>Just to spend</i>
<i>some time together, sweetheart.</i>

20:31.041 --> 20:32.666
<i>All right, sweetheart.</i>

20:33.416 --> 20:36.041
Then comes the part that's most delicate.

20:38.750 --> 20:40.416
We will make him think

20:41.416 --> 20:43.375
that we're about to, uh,

20:44.041 --> 20:47.291
launch the operation
that will lead to his arrest.

20:47.375 --> 20:48.333
So beautiful.

20:48.416 --> 20:51.916
Do you think that I should book
the hotel in Cefalù this weekend or not?

20:52.583 --> 20:53.916
<i>Hmm, better not.</i>

20:54.416 --> 20:57.125
Our source says it's only
a matter of hours before we take him down.

20:59.458 --> 21:02.125
Oh well, we've got
our whole lives to go there.

21:27.625 --> 21:30.916
Holy Father, you'll be safer here.

21:32.125 --> 21:35.291
Wait! Do you really need
to go out for dessert

21:35.375 --> 21:37.375
when you have
this beautiful cake right here?

21:37.458 --> 21:39.250
Mama, huh.

21:41.000 --> 21:43.000
The ricotta is fresh inside.

21:43.583 --> 21:46.708
Right, it's only natural
that children fly the nest.

21:47.291 --> 21:48.541
Please.

21:48.625 --> 21:49.666
Thank you.

21:49.750 --> 21:51.458
Enjoy yourselves.

21:55.666 --> 21:57.333
I'll see you later.

21:57.416 --> 22:01.458
Mama, I told you. I'm going
to be staying over at Agata's tonight.

22:07.708 --> 22:09.583
YOU'RE BEING RIDICULOUS

22:13.583 --> 22:16.333
Well, at least take
this delicious cake with you.

22:22.125 --> 22:25.333
- That was amazing.
- It was amazing for me too.

22:25.416 --> 22:26.791
A DESPICABLE IDIOT
YOU MAKE ME SICK

22:26.875 --> 22:29.041
I haven't been this happy for a long time.

22:29.125 --> 22:30.208
YOU SUCK
YOU'RE PATHETIC

22:30.291 --> 22:31.333
YOU ARE DEAD TO ME

22:31.416 --> 22:32.708
You're so sweet.

22:32.791 --> 22:34.666
You really are incredible.

22:35.416 --> 22:38.125
And you're even more beautiful
when you smile.

22:39.541 --> 22:41.166
You just noticed now?

22:42.208 --> 22:44.333
No, I've always noticed.

22:44.416 --> 22:48.291
It's just sometimes you need 20 years
to pluck up the courage to say so.

22:48.375 --> 22:50.958
Mamma mia! What a gruesome sight.

22:51.041 --> 22:53.125
You've got to be convincing.

22:53.625 --> 22:55.750
The operation depends on it.

22:55.833 --> 22:57.750
And once we set the mood,

22:57.833 --> 22:59.625
that's when we drop the bomb.

22:59.708 --> 23:01.791
You've only got one flaw.

23:01.875 --> 23:02.708
What?

23:02.791 --> 23:03.666
YOU DISGUST ME

23:03.750 --> 23:06.000
You're home from work
and still a police officer.

23:06.500 --> 23:10.625
You won't tell me the name of that
Mafia guy who's after the Holy Father.

23:11.208 --> 23:14.291
<i>Of course not. </i>
<i>'m still a police officer.</i>

23:14.375 --> 23:16.125
<i>Come on, tell me.</i>

23:16.208 --> 23:18.208
- No, I'll never tell you.
- I know.

23:18.291 --> 23:20.458
- If you don't say it, I'll tickle you.

23:20.541 --> 23:22.166
- Come on! Tell me.
- No.

23:22.250 --> 23:24.416
Come on.
Don't make me tickle you for it.

23:24.500 --> 23:27.416
- Not fair!
- Don't you trust me?

23:31.166 --> 23:33.125
I trust you, my sweetheart.

23:34.208 --> 23:36.666
Get closer
and I'll whisper it into your ear.

23:41.333 --> 23:42.833
Dang!

23:42.916 --> 23:45.833
What a strange name for a Mafioso!

23:46.333 --> 23:50.208
At which point, the Holy Father…

23:50.291 --> 23:52.625
…will make
the worst mistake of his career.

23:52.708 --> 23:54.375
He'll ask you to meet with the two of you.

23:54.458 --> 23:56.583
Bring them here as soon as you can.

23:58.208 --> 23:59.166
You got it.

24:00.625 --> 24:01.750
I'll get them here.

24:01.833 --> 24:04.041
How will you figure out
where they're going to take us?

24:04.125 --> 24:08.916
We've got a little GPS
that we're going to sew into your clothes.

24:09.000 --> 24:13.208
Then there'll be another one,
to be on the safe side, with a magnet.

24:13.291 --> 24:15.625
You'll attach it directly to the car.

24:16.833 --> 24:20.000
And then there'll be another one

24:20.083 --> 24:22.833
hiding inside
of this little two-euro coin.

24:22.916 --> 24:24.916
You just need
to get this in Tonino's pocket.

24:25.000 --> 24:26.083
Pocket?

24:26.166 --> 24:27.791
You can do it.

24:27.875 --> 24:30.958
Oh, we'll… follow you there.

24:31.041 --> 24:34.125
And we'll swoop in at the right time,
just moments after you…

24:34.208 --> 24:36.208
right after you get there.

24:39.500 --> 24:41.666
And finally, my dear Girolamo,

24:42.833 --> 24:43.875
we'll get him.

24:46.000 --> 24:47.125
We'll get him.

24:47.208 --> 24:49.875
But if we're later
for one reason or another,

24:49.958 --> 24:51.666
our infiltrators could be in grave danger.

24:51.750 --> 24:52.916
Yes, I think so too.

24:53.000 --> 24:56.083
If the boss feels he's under attack,

24:56.166 --> 24:58.750
these two are handy for him to have.

24:58.833 --> 25:00.166
No need to worry.

25:00.791 --> 25:05.375
He won't touch a hair
on their pretty little heads.

25:07.583 --> 25:09.125
I understand perfectly.

25:10.375 --> 25:14.375
Once these two assholes finish telling us
all the information that they've got,

25:15.083 --> 25:17.875
we'll send them to meet their maker.
