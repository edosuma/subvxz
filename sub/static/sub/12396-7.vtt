WEBVTT

00:14.610 --> 00:16.441
- SO WE JUST GOT A BIG BREAK
IN OUR PURSUIT

00:16.480 --> 00:20.268
OF LOCAL CRIME BOSS MAX RIZZO,
AKA "MAX THE AXE."

00:20.320 --> 00:22.618
- IF I WAS A MOBSTER,
I THINK MY MOBSTER NAME

00:22.650 --> 00:24.481
WOULD BE "FRANKY FRICTION."

00:24.520 --> 00:26.488
- THAT SOUNDS LIKE A PORN NAME.

00:26.520 --> 00:28.488
- NO, "CHUBBY PUMPALOAF"
SOUNDS LIKE A PORN NAME.

00:28.520 --> 00:29.748
- OKAY, SPENCER, PLEASE?

00:29.790 --> 00:31.428
- MY BAD, CHIEF.
- MM-HMM.

00:31.460 --> 00:34.122
NOW, RIZZO'S
LONGTIME ACCOUNTANT,

00:34.160 --> 00:36.765
HERB POLLACK, HAS REPORTEDLY
FLED THE ORGANIZATION

00:36.800 --> 00:39.291
WITH A SIZEABLE AMOUNT
OF RIZZO'S CASH

00:39.340 --> 00:42.366
AND COPIES OF ALL
OF HIS FINANCIAL RECORDS,

00:42.410 --> 00:46.676
WHICH MEANS THAT IF WE CAN GET
TO POLLACK BEFORE RIZZO DOES,

00:46.710 --> 00:48.678
WE'LL HAVE ALL THE EVIDENCE
TO PUT THIS LOWLIFE AWAY

00:48.710 --> 00:50.644
FOR A VERY LONG TIME.

00:50.680 --> 00:52.841
OH, DETECTIVE, WE WERE
JUST DISCUSSING THE FACT --

00:52.880 --> 00:54.643
- BUP, BUP, BUP,
I AM NOT HERE.

00:54.680 --> 00:57.183
I TOOK THE DAY OFF TO DO
MY WEDDING PLANNING, REMEMBER?

00:57.220 --> 00:59.108
I DON'T WANT TO BE BOTHERED
WITH ANY POLICE BUSINESS.

00:59.160 --> 01:00.650
THAT'S MAX RIZZO
AND HIS ACCOUNTANT.

01:00.690 --> 01:02.123
- WHO JUST FLED
THE ORGANIZATION.

01:02.160 --> 01:04.628
- WHAT?
THAT IS HUGE NEWS...

01:04.660 --> 01:06.389
WHICH I WILL DEAL WITH
TOMORROW...

01:06.430 --> 01:07.499
WHEN I RETURN TO WORK.

01:07.530 --> 01:09.418
- YOU'RE DOING ALL YOUR WEDDING
PLANNING IN ONE DAY?

01:09.470 --> 01:11.620
- YES, BECAUSE I HAVE
MALE PARTS.

01:11.670 --> 01:12.659
HERE, CHECK IT OUT.

01:12.700 --> 01:15.362
I ALREADY HAVE
THE SAVE-THE-DATES.

01:15.400 --> 01:17.106
ONE FOR YOU...

01:17.140 --> 01:19.108
ONE FOR YOU.

01:19.140 --> 01:21.233
I DON'T KNOW YOU.

01:21.280 --> 01:25.376
FOR YOU, AND ONE FOR YOU.

01:25.410 --> 01:26.718

01:37.590 --> 01:41.424
ONE FOR YOU
AND ONE FOR YOU AND...

01:41.460 --> 01:44.520
- UM, IT SAYS TO RSVP
BY NOON TODAY.

01:44.570 --> 01:45.525
- WHAT CAN I SAY?

01:45.570 --> 01:47.834
I'VE GOT ONE SPEED,
AND IT IS FULL THROTTLE.

01:47.870 --> 01:49.508
PLUS, THERE WAS
A LAST-MINUTE CANCELATION

01:49.540 --> 01:50.507
AT CASTEN MEADOWS.

01:50.540 --> 01:52.679
- OKAY, SO I FEEL
LIKE MY BRIEFING IS DONE.

01:52.710 --> 01:54.234
THANK YOU, EVERYONE.

01:54.280 --> 01:57.647

01:57.680 --> 01:59.671
- LOOKS LIKE I'M GONNA HAVE

01:59.720 --> 02:02.587
RACHAEL'S IN LONDON
TAKING MAX TO SEE HIS DAD.

02:02.620 --> 02:05.282
- YOU DIDN'T TELL ME THAT.
- I'M TELLING YOU NOW.

02:05.320 --> 02:06.514
- AND YOU'RE COOL?

02:06.560 --> 02:09.154
- OF COURSE. WHY WOULDN'T I BE?
- I DON'T KNOW.

02:09.190 --> 02:12.591
'CAUSE SHE'S IN A FOREIGN LAND
WITH AN OLD FLAME.

02:12.630 --> 02:13.654
HE MIGHT BE ALL..

02:13.700 --> 02:15.622
[in Jamaican accent]
"HEY, MY GIRL.

02:15.660 --> 02:17.560
"YOU WANT TO SEE MY JOHNNYCAKE?

02:17.600 --> 02:19.397
ROW-TI -TI ! "

02:19.440 --> 02:20.668
- OKAY, FIRST OF ALL,

RACHAEL AND I
HAVE A SECURE RELATIONSHIP.

02:22.610 --> 02:25.329
AND SECONDLY, HER EX IS BRITISH,
NOT JAMAICAN.

02:25.370 --> 02:27.235

02:31.910 --> 02:33.946
AND I KNOW SHE WAS HOPING

02:33.980 --> 02:35.948
- UH, DIDN'T BIG WENDY DO TIME

02:35.980 --> 02:37.641
FOR KILLING A MAN

02:37.690 --> 02:39.385

02:40.690 --> 02:42.226
COME ON, IT'LL BE FUN.

02:42.260 --> 02:43.921
IT'S GONNA BE AT
THE AGUA VERDE HOTEL AND CASINO

02:43.960 --> 02:44.824
IN SANTA YNEZ.

02:44.860 --> 02:47.328
THAT PLACE IS FIRST CLASS
ALL THE WAY.

02:47.360 --> 02:49.828
- ISN'T MCNAB DOING
PART-TIME SECURITY WORK THERE?

02:49.870 --> 02:52.338

02:54.240 --> 02:56.800
- GREAT! I'LL GIVE BIG WENDY
YOUR PHONE NUMBERS.

02:56.840 --> 02:58.728
MARLOWE'S GONNA BE SO EXCITED.

02:58.770 --> 03:00.772
- LASSIE, WE'RE A LITTLE HURT
THAT YOU DIDN'T INVITE US

03:00.810 --> 03:01.936
TO YOUR BACHELOR PARTY.

03:01.980 --> 03:03.379
WE'D INVITE YOU TO OURS.

03:03.410 --> 03:04.672
- PROVIDED A BUNCH OF PEOPLE
DROPPED OUT.

03:04.710 --> 03:05.870
- AND YOU WERE WILLING
TO PAY FOR STUFF.

03:05.910 --> 03:08.242
- YEAH, WELL, THERE'S NOT GONNA
BE A BACHELOR PARTY, SO...

03:08.280 --> 03:10.885
- WHOA, SAY WHAT? WHAT?

03:10.920 --> 03:12.808
- WELL, THERE IS SO MUCH WORK
TO DO AROUND HERE.

03:12.860 --> 03:14.953
I MEAN, RIZZO'S ACCOUNTANT
IS OUT THERE FOR THE TAKING.

03:14.990 --> 03:16.651
[both imitates buzzer sounding]

03:16.690 --> 03:18.829
- AND STUMPY IS TIED UP
IN CHICAGO

03:18.860 --> 03:20.999
AND DOESN'T LOOK LIKE HE'LL BE
ABLE TO MAKE THE WEDDING,

03:21.030 --> 03:22.793
LET ALONE A BACHELOR PARTY,
SO...

03:22.830 --> 03:25.219
- WHO IS STUMPY?
- AND HOW DID HE LOSE HIS LEG?

03:25.270 --> 03:27.363

HE'S MY BEST FRIEND.

03:27.400 --> 03:29.402
HE'S MY BEST MAN.
HE'S THE STUMPINATOR.

03:29.440 --> 03:30.839
WE GREW UP TOGETHER.

03:30.870 --> 03:33.668
HE IS THE FUNNIEST GUY
YOU WILL EVER MEET.

03:33.710 --> 03:35.905
IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME,

UNLESS STUMPY COULD COME, SO...

05:21.050 --> 05:23.086

AN ILLEGAL SUBSTANCE

06:33.720 --> 06:35.449
AS THEY DID IN THE HANGOVER.

06:35.490 --> 06:36.889
- OKAY, FIRST OF ALL,
THAT WAS A MOVIE

06:36.930 --> 06:38.625

ABOUT KEEPING THIS THING CLEAN?

OF MAKING BITCHES DO SHOTS.

09:08.140 --> 09:10.574
- ALL RIGHTY, THEN.

09:10.610 --> 09:13.613
I'LL SEE YOU IN THE E.R.

09:15.880 --> 09:18.110
- ALL RIGHT, OKAY.

09:18.150 --> 09:21.153
20 MORE, GIRL. 20 MORE.
- [groans]

09:21.190 --> 09:23.624
- THIS PLACE IS JUST LIKE VEGAS.
- A LITTLE SMALLER.

09:23.660 --> 09:26.185
- I'M GUESSING THE ESCORTS
MIGHT BE A BIT DICEY.

09:26.230 --> 09:28.118
THEN AGAIN, WE HAVEN'T
REALLY STARTED DRINKING YET.

09:28.160 --> 09:30.094
- AND THE CRITERIA'S BOUND
TO CHANGE.

09:30.130 --> 09:31.358
- WE CAN LOOK,
BUT WE CAN'T TOUCH.

09:31.400 --> 09:33.095
- [chuckles]

09:33.140 --> 09:34.368
- WHY DO YOU KEEP CHECKING
THAT THING?

09:34.400 --> 09:36.095
- UH, NO REASON.

09:36.140 --> 09:39.234
- WHOA, HO, HO!
HE IS MOVING THE HIPS!

09:39.270 --> 09:42.239
- HE'S WORKING THE ROOM!
- SOMEBODY'S HAVING FUN!

09:42.280 --> 09:44.976
- ALL RIGHT, I ADMIT IT--
IT IS GOOD TO BE HERE.

09:45.010 --> 09:47.114
I MEAN, YOU GUYS
WON'T BELIEVE THIS,

09:47.150 --> 09:49.141
BUT I GET SO CAUGHT UP
WITH WORK

09:49.180 --> 09:50.989
AND OPPOSING THE HEALTH CARE LAW
AT A GRASSROOTS LEVEL

09:51.020 --> 09:53.250
THAT SOMETIMES I JUST FORGET
TO, YOU KNOW, CUT LOOSE

09:53.290 --> 09:55.087
AND HAVE SOME FUN.

09:55.120 --> 09:57.850
- HEY! ASS-ITER!
- STUMP-ITER!

09:57.890 --> 09:59.790
I CAN'T BELIEVE
THIS GUY IS HERE!

09:59.830 --> 10:00.797
OH--
- [laughs]

10:00.830 --> 10:03.924
- OH! EVERY TIME!
EVERY TIME.

10:03.970 --> 10:05.961
- HEY, I NEED 300 BUCKS.
COME ON.

10:06.000 --> 10:07.365
- YOU GOT IT,
STUMPELSTILTSKIN.

10:07.400 --> 10:09.265
THAT SHOULD DO IT.

10:09.300 --> 10:11.234
THERE YOU GO.
- UH-HUH.

10:11.270 --> 10:14.068
- OH! [chuckles]
IS THAT GUY AWESOME OR WHAT?

10:14.110 --> 10:17.648
- WE TOTALLY UNDERSTAND
WHY YOU DIG HIM SO MUCH.

10:17.680 --> 10:18.840
- GRANTED,
THE STUMPINATOR AND I--

10:18.880 --> 10:20.040
WE'RE VERY DIFFERENT PEOPLE,

10:20.080 --> 10:21.342
BUT AT HIS CORE,
THE STUMPINATOR

10:21.380 --> 10:23.746
IS ONE OF THE MOST DECENT
AND TRUSTWORTHY PEOPLE

10:23.790 --> 10:25.109
YOU WILL EVER MEET.

10:25.150 --> 10:26.981
WELL, NOW,
YOU GENTLEMEN EXCUSE ME.

10:27.020 --> 10:29.181
I'M GONNA GO SHOOT SOME CRAPS.

10:29.220 --> 10:32.326
HEY-YO!
[laughing]

10:32.360 --> 10:34.055
- HIS FRIEND IS AN IDIOT,

10:34.100 --> 10:37.024
BUT I MUST SAY IT IS NICE SEEING
LASSIE CUT LOOSE.

10:37.070 --> 10:39.288
- I AGREE. IT'S ALL ABOUT
GETTING HIM AWAY FROM WORK.

10:39.330 --> 10:41.935
- YEAH.
I THINK I'M GONNA GO JOIN HIM.

10:41.970 --> 10:43.369
- YOU'RE GONNA SHOOT CRAPS?

10:43.410 --> 10:45.731
- NAH, I'LL BE
AT THE NICKEL SLOTS.

10:45.770 --> 10:47.374
- EH.

10:50.010 --> 10:53.377
- IF WE CAN GET TO POLLACK
BEFORE RIZZO DOES,

10:53.420 --> 10:55.411
WE'LL HAVE ALL THE EVIDENCE
TO PUT THIS LOWLIFE AWAY

10:55.450 --> 10:58.749
FOR A LONG TIME.

10:58.790 --> 11:01.850
- OH, MY GOD!
- AND YOU TWO--I KNEW IT!

11:01.890 --> 11:05.121
- ALL RIGHT, GIRLS.
GIRLS, GIRLS, GIRLS.

11:05.160 --> 11:07.390
IS IT JUST ME,
OR HAS IT GOTTEN HOT UP IN HERE?

11:07.430 --> 11:09.864
- OH, IT'S PRETTY HOT.
[whistle blows]

11:09.900 --> 11:11.993
- YOU HAVE THE RIGHT
TO REMAIN SILENT.

11:12.030 --> 11:15.397
[woman screaming,
dance music playing]

11:15.440 --> 11:18.307
- SHAKE IT, BABY!

11:18.340 --> 11:21.969
YES!
YOU BETTER SHAKE IT!

11:22.010 --> 11:25.741
[women shouting and laughing]

11:25.780 --> 11:29.887
- THAT IS NOT OKAY.
THAT'S ILLEGAL!

11:29.920 --> 11:33.014
AAH!

11:33.060 --> 11:34.880
[gaSPSJ

11:34.920 --> 11:36.922
- BUZZ?

11:36.960 --> 11:39.383
- I SWEAR, I CAN EXPLAIN.

11:39.430 --> 11:41.091
- I'M SOBER NOW.

11:41.130 --> 11:43.690
- CONGRATULATIONS.

11:45.100 --> 11:47.898
- OKAY, WHAT IS THIS, UH,
STRAIGHT-TO-VOICE-MAIL NONSENSE?

11:47.940 --> 11:50.067
DUDE, WHERE DID YOU GO?

11:50.110 --> 11:52.169
- CALL ME BACK.

11:52.210 --> 11:54.178
I MISS YOU.
- HEY.

11:54.210 --> 11:56.474
YOU SAID YOU WERE GOING TO PLAY
THE NICKEL SLOTS.

11:56.510 --> 11:57.579
EXPLAIN YOURSELF.

11:57.610 --> 11:59.817
- YOU GOT ALL IN MY HEAD
ABOUT RACHAEL'S EX BEING--

11:59.850 --> 12:02.887
- [Jamaican accent] EY, MY GIRL.
- HE'S NOT JAMAICAN.

12:02.920 --> 12:04.410
BUT SHE HASN'T CALLED
SINCE SHE LANDED,

12:04.450 --> 12:05.610
AND I'M STARTING
TO GET NERVOUS.

12:05.650 --> 12:08.983
- ALL RIGHT, LOOK, IT'S PROBABLY
THE TIME DIFFERENCE, OKAY?

12:09.020 --> 12:11.124
BESIDES, WE HAVE MUCH BIGGER
ISSUES RIGHT NOW.

12:11.160 --> 12:13.128
- WHAT?
- HERB POLLACK IS HERE.

12:13.160 --> 12:15.526
- MAX RIZZO'S ACCOUNTANT?
- WHAT ARE THE ODDS?

12:15.560 --> 12:16.993
WE GOT TO ALERT
THE LOCAL POLICE

12:17.030 --> 12:18.258
AND GET LASSIE
THE HELL OUT OF HERE.

12:18.300 --> 12:19.369
OTHERWISE,
OUR SWEET LITTLE PARTY

12:19.400 --> 12:21.891
IS GONNA BECOME A WORK TRIP.
[elevator bell dings]

12:21.940 --> 12:25.000
- OH, HEY, GUYS.
LOOK WHO I FOUND.

12:25.040 --> 12:26.439
- HELLO.
- SHUT UP.

12:38.820 --> 12:40.515
- [chuckles]
I RULE.

12:40.560 --> 12:43.085
- NICE FREAKIN' PARTY.

12:43.130 --> 12:44.324
WHERE'S STUMPY, BY THE WAY?

12:44.360 --> 12:46.123
- SOMEWHERE
DISAPPOINTING JESUS.

12:46.160 --> 12:47.855
- AW, COME ON, GANG.
CHEER UP.

12:47.900 --> 12:49.253
WE WILL RECOMMENCE
THE FESTIVITIES

12:49.300 --> 12:50.528
AS SOON AS WE DROP
THIS SCHLUB OFF

12:50.570 --> 12:52.492
TO THE LOCAL AUTHORITIES
FOR SAFEKEEPING.

12:52.530 --> 12:54.031
- WELL, YOU DO REALIZE
THAT I'M NO GOOD

12:54.070 --> 12:55.298
WITHOUT
THE FLASH DRIVES, RIGHT?

12:55.340 --> 12:57.433
YOU THINK I JUST WALK AROUND
WITH HARD COPIES

12:57.470 --> 12:59.438
OF A MOB BOSS'S TAXES?

12:59.470 --> 13:01.233
THEY'RE ALL ON A COUPLE
OF DRIVES BACK AT MY APARTMENT.

13:01.280 --> 13:04.101
- SO WE'LL DROP YOU OFF
TO THE LOCAL BRETHREN

13:04.150 --> 13:06.402
AND COME BACK FOR 'EM LATER.
- OKAY.

13:06.450 --> 13:09.544
THAT IS ASSUMING THAT
RIZZO DOESN'T GET TO THEM FIRST.

13:09.580 --> 13:12.242
[sighs] ONE DOESN'T GET TO BE
A RUTHLESS CRIME LORD

13:12.290 --> 13:13.917
WITHOUT BEING PERSISTENT.

13:13.960 --> 13:17.157
LOOK, MY CONDO
IS THREE BLOCKS THAT WAY.

13:17.190 --> 13:19.351
I'LL RUN IN REAL QUICK.

13:19.390 --> 13:21.494
- IF YOU ARE MESSING WITH ME,
I WILL PUNCH YOU IN THE FACE

13:21.530 --> 13:23.066
SO HARD--
- LOOK.

13:23.100 --> 13:25.091
I WANT TO PUT HIM AWAY TOO.

13:25.130 --> 13:28.236
THAT WAY, HE WON'T KILL ME.

13:28.270 --> 13:30.500
- DAMN IT.
HENRY, BANG A RIGHT UP HERE.

13:30.540 --> 13:32.838
- HENRY, BANG A RIGHT.

13:34.310 --> 13:37.177
- YOU SAID YOU WERE WORKING
SECURITY HERE.

13:37.210 --> 13:39.576
- NO, I SAID I WORE
A SECURITY UNIFORM HERE,

13:39.610 --> 13:42.170
WHICH IS TECHNICALLY TRUE,
THOUGH THIS ONE'S A TEAR-AWAY.

13:42.220 --> 13:43.539
- HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN
DOING THIS?

13:43.590 --> 13:45.114
- A COUPLE OF MONTHS.

13:45.150 --> 13:46.447
- FRANCINE AND I ARE SAVING
FOR A NEW CONDO,

13:46.490 --> 13:48.151
AND WE REALLY NEED
THE EXTRA CASH.

13:48.190 --> 13:49.555
YOU KNOW, PLUS, IT'S
A GREAT GROUP OF GUYS,

13:49.590 --> 13:51.353
AND WE REALLY SUPPORT
EACH OTHER,

13:51.390 --> 13:52.618
AND I NEVER GO FULL NUDE.

13:52.660 --> 13:55.094
I JUST STRIP DOWN TO THE THONG--
- BUZZ, BUZZ.

13:55.130 --> 13:58.099
- OH, GOD.
THIS IS AWFUL, ISN'T IT?

13:58.130 --> 14:01.065
I'M GONNA GET FIRED, AREN'T I?

14:01.100 --> 14:03.307
- [groans]

14:03.340 --> 14:05.331
- NOT IF YOU LEAVE RIGHT NOW.

14:05.370 --> 14:08.237
- [whispering] I WAS NEVER HERE.
- [whispering] OKAY.

14:10.110 --> 14:13.238
- OOPS.
I FORGOT MY BOOMER.

14:16.380 --> 14:20.055
- MARLOWE?
WHAT'S WRONG?

14:20.090 --> 14:22.558
WE CAN GET ANOTHER STRIPPER.

14:22.590 --> 14:24.353
- WHAT IF I CAN'T GO THROUGH
WITH IT?

14:24.390 --> 14:27.223
- WELL, THERE'S PAY-PER-VIEW.
THERE'S--

14:27.260 --> 14:31.196
- THAT'S NOT
WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.

14:31.230 --> 14:33.232
- WHOA.

14:33.270 --> 14:35.192
WAIT.
WHAT HAPPENED?

14:35.240 --> 14:38.334
- IT'S JUST ALL HAPPENING
SO FAST.

14:38.370 --> 14:41.203
I MEAN, I LOVE CARLTON,

14:41.240 --> 14:42.605
BUT THREE WEEKS AGO,

14:42.640 --> 14:45.177
I WAS IN A CELL
MAKING SOAP TCHOTCHKES.

14:45.210 --> 14:49.112
- LOOK, THIS IS A HUGE STEP
FOR CARLTON TOO.

14:49.150 --> 14:51.243
I MEAN, YOU TWO ARE CRAZY
ABOUT EACH OTHER.

14:54.290 --> 14:55.587
- [groans]

14:55.620 --> 14:58.180
I GOT TO GET SOME AIR.

14:59.390 --> 15:00.698
- [exhales deeply]

15:00.730 --> 15:04.029
- THE FLASH DRIVES
ARE IN MY BEDROOM.

15:04.070 --> 15:05.594
I PUT IT
IN A HOLLOWED-OUT BOOK.

15:05.630 --> 15:07.598
- DO YOU THINK I GIVE
A RAT'S ASS WHERE IT IS?

15:07.640 --> 15:09.631
GO GET IT.

15:12.310 --> 15:15.074
- WHOA.

15:15.110 --> 15:17.078
THIS DUDE HAS A RECEIPT
FOR A TICKET

15:17.110 --> 15:20.944
TO A MICHAEL DAMIAN CONCERT.

15:20.980 --> 15:22.242
HUH.

15:22.280 --> 15:23.349
- WHY WOULD YOU TAKE THAT?

15:23.390 --> 15:25.642
- BECAUSE IT HAD A PICTURE
OF MICHAEL DAMIAN ON IT.

15:32.660 --> 15:35.254
- 15-LOVE.

15:39.370 --> 15:41.497
- BRO, YOU GOT
A MONSTER BACKHAND.

15:57.220 --> 16:00.109
- RUN!

16:00.160 --> 16:01.457
- BATTERY ACID.

16:01.490 --> 16:03.981
I'LL TAKE A CASE.
- OH, OKAY.

16:04.030 --> 16:07.249
- [shouting]
- HENRY, FIRE UP THE BUS!

16:07.300 --> 16:11.327
COME ON, STRODE! RUN!
- WHY ARE WE RUNNING?

16:11.370 --> 16:13.634
[gun cocks]

16:15.440 --> 16:17.965
[bullets ricocheting]

16:22.780 --> 16:25.203
[cell phone rings]

16:25.250 --> 16:26.444
- UNCLE MAX.

16:26.480 --> 16:28.573
- TELL ME YOU TWO CRAP HEADS
FOUND POLLACK.

16:28.620 --> 16:30.087
- WELL, WE DID.

16:30.120 --> 16:31.348
THEN THAT COP FROM SANTA BARBARA

16:31.390 --> 16:32.516
THAT LOOKS LIKE MR. BEAN
GOT HIM.

16:32.550 --> 16:33.585
- LASSITER?

16:33.620 --> 16:35.554
WHAT THE HELL'S THAT GOON
DOING UP IN SANTA YNEZ?

16:35.590 --> 16:38.753
- GETTING MARRIED, APPARENTLY,
TO SOME BROAD NAMED MARLOWE.

16:41.100 --> 16:43.398
- SKIP THE PARAFFIN, JING-WEI.
I GOT TO BOUNCE.

16:49.500 --> 16:51.536
- CHIEF.
- OH, YEAH?

16:51.570 --> 16:53.106
- HAVE YOU SEEN MARLOWE?

16:53.140 --> 16:55.472
- I HAVE NOT.

16:59.550 --> 17:01.745
- AIN'T NO WAY
SHE LEFT THIS CASINO.

17:01.780 --> 17:04.783
SHE COULDN'T HAVE,
NOT WEARING THEM HO CLOTHES.

17:04.820 --> 17:06.583
- [chuckles]

17:06.620 --> 17:10.579
- EXCUSE ME.
DO ANY OF YOU THREE HAVE DONGS?

17:10.630 --> 17:12.484
BECAUSE I FAILED TO ASK THAT

17:12.530 --> 17:16.455
OF THE LAST PROSTITUTE
AND LIVED TO REGRET IT.

17:18.870 --> 17:21.532
[whimpers]

WHERE SHE IS?

17:28.540 --> 17:29.507
- OKAY.

17:29.540 --> 17:31.144
- WHO WAS THAT?
WAS IT RACHAEL?

17:31.180 --> 17:33.375
- WHY WOULD RACHAEL CALL ME?
THAT WAS JULES.

17:33.420 --> 17:34.318
- WHAT'D SHE WANT?

17:34.350 --> 17:36.375
- UH, YOUR FIREARMS
ARE BEING DELIVERED

17:36.420 --> 17:38.115
TO THE HOTEL AS REQUESTED.
- EXCELLENT.

17:38.150 --> 17:39.811
LET'S DUMP OFF THIS LOSER
AND GET BACK

17:39.850 --> 17:41.659

WITH A BUDDY OF YOURS.

17:58.810 --> 18:01.108
OH, HANG ON.
HE WANTS TO SAY HELLO.

18:01.140 --> 18:02.573
SAY HELLO.
- HELLO?

18:02.610 --> 18:06.546
- BAM! YOUR ASS IS GOING DOWN
FOR A LONG TIME.

18:06.580 --> 18:07.512
- IS THAT RIGHT?

18:07.550 --> 18:09.279
[chuckles] WELL, THAT SHOULD
BE INTERESTING.

18:09.320 --> 18:10.446
- YEAH.

18:10.490 --> 18:12.117
- 'CAUSE YOU SEE,
AS LUCK WOULD HAVE IT,

18:12.150 --> 18:15.551
I'M HANGING OUT
WITH AN OLD FRIEND OF YOURS.

18:17.160 --> 18:18.650
- BABY.

A STRAIGHT-UP SWAP.

18:24.930 --> 18:27.637
MARLOWE FOR HERB--
THAT'S THE DEAL.

18:27.670 --> 18:31.629
I HAVE ONE WEAKNESS
IN THIS LIFE, AND HE HAS HER.

18:31.670 --> 18:34.230
SHE'S PROBABLY SCARED TO DEATH,
AND I'M NOT THERE TO HELP HER.

18:34.280 --> 18:36.840
- OH, LET HER GO, C-DOG.

18:36.880 --> 18:38.745
THERE ARE, LIKE,
3 BILLION CHICKS OUT THERE

18:38.780 --> 18:42.272
THAT NEED DUDES LIKE US,
AND THAT'S JUST IN THE UKRAINE.

18:42.320 --> 18:45.414
- THAT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE.

18:45.450 --> 18:46.883
- THIS IS BY FAR
THE WORST SELECTION

18:46.920 --> 18:49.218
OF ADULT FEATURES
I'VE EVER SEEN.

18:49.260 --> 18:50.557
CHITTY CHITTY GANGBANG?

18:50.590 --> 18:52.729
BATMAN AND THROBBIN'?

18:52.760 --> 18:53.795
HANNAH DOES HER SISTERS?

18:53.830 --> 18:55.422
I SAW THAT IN '92.

18:55.460 --> 18:57.291
WHERE'S THE SLO-MO?

18:57.330 --> 18:59.662
- CAN'T RISK IT.
I WON'T.

18:59.700 --> 19:01.395
I HAVE WAITED TOO LONG,

19:01.440 --> 19:04.739
AND I AM GOING TO MARRY
MY FIANCEE TOMORROW.

19:04.770 --> 19:07.898
I WILL PUT THAT GREASY SCUMBAG
RIZZO AWAY SOME OTHER DAY SOON.

19:07.940 --> 19:09.908
WE MAKE THE SWAP.
WE MAKE IT NOW.

19:09.940 --> 19:11.646
- UH, WHAT ABOUT THE CHIEF?

19:11.680 --> 19:14.376
- OH.
- YOU MUST TRY AND HYDRATE.

19:14.420 --> 19:17.241
- I CAN'T FEEL MY SKIN.

19:17.290 --> 19:19.315
I HAVEN'T DONE SHOTS
SINCE COLLEGE,

19:19.350 --> 19:21.659
AND I JUST DIDN'T WANT TO BE
THE WET BLANKET.

19:21.690 --> 19:24.386
- I KNOW YOU DIDN'T.

19:24.430 --> 19:26.523
- WHAT'S STUCK TO MY LIP?

19:26.560 --> 19:29.256
- IT'S A PEANUT SHELL, KAREN.

19:29.300 --> 19:31.393
- I BELIEVE THE CHIEF
IS OKAY WITH THIS PLAN.

19:31.430 --> 19:32.522
- YEAH.

19:32.570 --> 19:35.539
- LET'S GRAB HERB
OUT OF THE BEDROOM.

19:35.570 --> 19:38.903
- UH, HEY, Y'ALL.
UM, WE GOT A SERIOUS PROBLEM.

19:38.940 --> 19:41.670
- UH, WHY ARE YOU WEARING
A TOWEL?

19:41.710 --> 19:45.646
- OH, YOU--YOU GUYS
ARE GONNA BE SO MAD.

19:45.680 --> 19:47.443
- UM, HERB GOT AWAY.

19:47.480 --> 19:49.619
I MEAN, LITTLE WEASEL
JUST JUMPED OUT THE DAMN WINDOW.

19:49.650 --> 19:51.789
- IS THIS SOME KIND OF JOKE?

19:51.820 --> 19:53.788
THIS IS MY LIFE!

19:53.820 --> 19:56.789
POLLACK!

19:56.820 --> 19:58.685
- WENDY, WHAT HAPPENED?

19:58.730 --> 20:00.550
HE WAS HANDCUFFED
TO THE BEDPOST.

20:00.600 --> 20:01.919
- HE RIPPED HIMSELF FROM IT.

20:01.960 --> 20:04.394
I MEAN, AND, LIKE, HE GNAWED
HIS PAW LIKE A WOLF.

20:04.430 --> 20:05.658
- WOODY.

20:05.700 --> 20:07.736
- I'M SORRY, BUT SHE SMELLS
LIKE BISCUITS.

20:07.770 --> 20:10.500
- AW, THANKS, BOO.
[chuckles]

20:10.540 --> 20:13.008
- OOH.
WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO NOW?

20:13.040 --> 20:17.374
SOMEONE TELL ME WHAT IN THE HELL
I AM SUPPOSED TO DO NOW.

20:17.410 --> 20:19.241
O'HARA?
- COME HERE.

20:19.280 --> 20:22.249
SIT. BREATHE.

20:22.280 --> 20:25.886
SIT AND BREATHE.
- I HAVE AN IDEA.

20:25.920 --> 20:27.979
HOPE IS NOT LOST.

20:28.020 --> 20:31.251
HOW MUCH DO YOU TRUST ME?

20:35.560 --> 20:37.824
[tires screeching]

20:43.910 --> 20:45.537
- YOU ALL RIGHT THERE,
HONEY BUNNY?

20:45.570 --> 20:46.901
[indistinct muttering]

20:48.710 --> 20:50.268
WHY IS SHE IN A HOUSECOAT?

20:50.310 --> 20:51.868
IF YOU SO MUCH
AS BREATHED ON HER--

20:51.910 --> 20:53.514
- OH, NOBODY TOUCHED HER.

20:53.550 --> 20:56.348
NOW, GIVE ME MY RAT.

20:56.380 --> 20:57.586
- LET'S GO.
GO AHEAD.

20:57.620 --> 20:59.383
WALK TOWARDS MY VOICE, BABY.

20:59.420 --> 21:01.411
ALL RIGHT, THIS WAY.
THERE YOU GO, BABY.

21:01.460 --> 21:03.519
HOPE YOU SAID
YOUR PRAYERS, HERB.

21:03.560 --> 21:05.949
- HEY, AND REMEMBER,
HE ENDS UP IN A DITCH,

21:05.990 --> 21:07.821
I WILL HAVE YOU BY THE PLUMS
FOR MURDER.

21:07.860 --> 21:09.725
I MEAN, DON'T YOU THINK
YOUR LITTLE BUDDY HERB THERE

21:09.760 --> 21:11.421
MADE COPIES OF THOSE FILES?

21:11.470 --> 21:13.791
IF I WERE YOU,
I'D GIVE HIM A RAISE

21:13.840 --> 21:15.592
AND TAKE HIM OUT
TO DINNER AND A SHOW.

21:15.640 --> 21:17.528
- DON'T YOU TRY TO TELL ME
ABOUT MY BUSINESS.

21:17.570 --> 21:22.405
- [moaning and groaning]

21:22.440 --> 21:24.374
- MAN, HAVE SOME RESPECT
FOR YOURSELF.

21:24.410 --> 21:25.809
- GOOD LUCK THERE, HERB.

21:25.850 --> 21:27.340
YOU'RE ON BORROWED TIME,
DIRTBAG.

21:27.380 --> 21:29.541
- [chuckles]
CATCH ME IF YOU CAN, HAM BONE.

21:29.580 --> 21:30.888
- TAKE IT TO THE BANK.
THERE YOU GO, BABY.

21:30.920 --> 21:33.980
[people screaming, laughing
in the distance]

21:39.960 --> 21:43.566
[tires screech]

21:48.970 --> 21:50.938
- YOU DOUBLE-CROSSED ME,
YOU RAT BASTARD!

21:50.970 --> 21:52.767
- LOOK WHO'S TALKING,
YOU SON OF A BITCH!

21:52.810 --> 21:54.630
- WHO THE HELL IS THAT?

21:54.680 --> 21:56.705
- RETIRED DETECTIVE FIRST GRADE
HENRY SPENCER.

21:56.740 --> 21:58.799
I BUSTED YOUR UNCLE SAL IN '83,

21:58.850 --> 22:01.614
SO GO AHEAD, PUNCH ME
IN THE FACE AS HARD AS YOU CAN.

22:01.650 --> 22:03.686
- I KNEW I COULDN'T TRUST YOU.

22:03.720 --> 22:06.382
THAT IS NOT MY FUTURE WIFE!

22:06.420 --> 22:08.786
- NO, BUT I COULD BE.

22:08.820 --> 22:13.553
- JESUS OF NAZARETH,
WHERE THE HELL IS MY FIANCEE?

22:13.600 --> 22:14.794
ALL RIGHT, LOOK.

22:14.830 --> 22:17.469
YOUR GAL GOT THE DROP
ON MY IDIOT NEPHEW TITO

22:17.500 --> 22:18.524
BACK AT THE HOTEL.

22:18.570 --> 22:19.628
SEE, IT TURNS OUT

22:19.670 --> 22:23.709
HE ORDERED A COMPANION
UP TO HIS ROOM, SIGHT UNSEEN.

22:23.740 --> 22:26.664
SHE SHOWS UP.
THE DONG COMES OUT.

22:26.710 --> 22:28.473
YOUR GAL SEIZES THE MOMENT,
AND BOB'S YOUR UNCLE.

22:28.510 --> 22:30.546
I GOT TO HAND IT TO YOU,
LASSITER--

22:30.580 --> 22:32.946
YOU ARE MARRYING
ONE TOUGH BROAD THERE.

22:32.980 --> 22:35.540
SHE EVEN BUSTED OUT
SOME MUAY THAI IN THE HALLWAY

22:35.580 --> 22:37.047
BEFORE SHE JUMPED OUT
THE WINDOW.

22:37.080 --> 22:38.786
- THAT IS MY GAL.

22:38.820 --> 22:39.980
IRONICALLY,

22:40.020 --> 22:42.454
YOUR BOY HERB SLIPPED THROUGH
THE FINGERS OF MY CORONER

22:42.490 --> 22:44.981
AND MARLOWE'S RECENTLY PAROLED
MAID OF HONOR.

22:45.030 --> 22:46.452
- ALL RIGHT, SO WHAT DO YOU SAY
WE JUST PRETEND

22:46.490 --> 22:47.957
IT NEVER HAPPENED?
- YEAH, FINE BY ME.

22:48.000 --> 22:49.752
YOU'LL BE BEHIND BARS
WITHIN A WEEK ANYWAY.

22:49.800 --> 22:50.960
- FAT CHANCE.

22:51.000 --> 22:54.993
I'LL SEE YOU
IN YOUR NIGHTMARES, PONY BOY.

22:55.040 --> 22:56.667
- W-WAIT A SECOND--
ARE YOU TELLING ME

22:56.700 --> 22:58.930
THAT RIZZO HAD
THE SAME EXACT PLAN WE DID?

22:58.970 --> 23:01.575
- YEP, WHICH MEANS
MY FIANCEE'S STILL MISSING.

23:01.610 --> 23:04.408
- WE'RE GOING TO FIND HER.
- THAT RIZZO'S A CAGEY BASTARD.

23:04.450 --> 23:06.543
TAKING OFF MY HOOD,
HE SEES I'M NOT HERB.

23:06.580 --> 23:08.172
HE HAS HIS LACKEY
TURN UP THE RADIO.

23:08.220 --> 23:09.278
HE KNOWS I'M WEARING A WIRE.

23:09.320 --> 23:11.185
WHOO! I GOT TO TELL YOU,
I HAVEN'T FELT THIS ALIVE

23:11.220 --> 23:12.949
SINCE JERRY CARP
SHOT ME IN THE CHEST.

23:12.990 --> 23:15.117
- WHEN YOU ALMOST DIED?
- EXACTLY.

23:15.160 --> 23:18.550
TEAM, THANK YOU FOR GETTING ME
BACK IN THE GAME.

23:18.590 --> 23:20.820
- HEY! ARE WE GONNA PARTY
OR WHAT?

23:23.130 --> 23:25.564
[all groan]

23:25.600 --> 23:28.137
[tires squeal]

23:39.980 --> 23:41.140
- IT'S IMPOSSIBLE!

23:41.180 --> 23:42.579
THERE'S NO WAY
SHE JUMPED OUT OF THIS WINDOW!

23:42.620 --> 23:46.579
IT'S TOO HIGH!
- NOT FOR SPIDER-MAN.

23:46.620 --> 23:47.609
- WHAT?

23:47.660 --> 23:49.082
HE WOULDN'T EVEN NEED HIS WEBS.

23:49.120 --> 23:52.487
HE COULD JUST SCALE
WITH HIS STICKY CRAWL.

23:52.530 --> 23:53.952
WHAT THE HECK
AM I TALKING ABOUT?

23:54.000 --> 23:56.560
- UH, LASSIE, THAT LEDGE
ACTUALLY TURNS THE CORNER

23:56.600 --> 23:58.022
AND RUNS ALONG
THE SIDE OF THE BUILDING

23:58.070 --> 23:59.219
TOWARDS THE FIRE ESCAPE.

23:59.270 --> 24:00.828
- THAT'S IT!

24:00.870 --> 24:02.565
SHE MUST'VE GONE
THROUGH THE WINDOW,

24:02.600 --> 24:04.602
ONTO THE LEDGE,
TIGHT-ROPED HER WAY AROUND

24:04.640 --> 24:05.664
AND MADE HER ESCAPE.

24:05.710 --> 24:08.804
OUR CHILDREN ARE GOING TO BE
SEAL TIME 6 MEMBERS!

24:08.840 --> 24:10.034
- WAIT A SECOND.

24:10.080 --> 24:11.707
IF MARLOWE'S JUST WALKING AROUND
FREE AS A BIRD,

24:11.750 --> 24:13.001
WHY HASN'T SHE CALLED?

24:13.050 --> 24:14.972
- MAYBE SHE GOT HUNGRY

24:15.020 --> 24:16.715
OR...

24:16.750 --> 24:18.513
MAYBE YOU SHOULD
SHUT UP, GUSTER.

24:18.550 --> 24:20.142
- IT'S A VALID QUESTION,
LASSIE.

24:20.190 --> 24:23.728
- CARLTON, THERE'S SOMETHING
YOU SHOULD KNOW.

24:23.760 --> 24:26.627
MARLOWE AND I--
- OOH! SILENCE, WOMAN!

24:26.660 --> 24:28.855
SORRY, SWEETHEART.
I'M GETTING SOMETHING.

24:28.900 --> 24:31.596
- YOU ARE MARRYING
ONE TOUGH BROAD THERE.

24:31.630 --> 24:34.030
SHE EVEN BUSTED OUT
SOME MUAY THAI IN THE HALLWAY

24:34.070 --> 24:36.732
BEFORE SHE JUMPED OUT
THE WINDOW.

24:43.010 --> 24:45.103
- WOW! HA!

24:45.150 --> 24:47.846
THAT IS EASILY
THE MOST SPECTACULAR VISION

24:47.880 --> 24:49.575
I'VE EVER HAD!

24:49.620 --> 24:51.508
I KNOW WHERE SHE IS!

24:51.550 --> 24:56.055
- [speaking native language]

24:56.090 --> 24:57.523
- I-I GOT IT FROM HERE, BUDDY.

24:57.560 --> 25:00.791
I'D LIKE MY FACE
TO BE THE FIRST THING SHE SEES.

25:00.830 --> 25:04.664
- [speaking native language]

25:04.700 --> 25:06.019
- BABY!

25:06.070 --> 25:08.664
- [shrieking]

25:08.700 --> 25:10.668
[96%]
OH, CARLTON.

25:10.710 --> 25:11.836
OH, ARE YOU OKAY?

25:11.870 --> 25:14.737
- WAS THAT...
A SPINNING BACK FIST?

25:14.780 --> 25:16.270
- YEAH.

25:16.310 --> 25:20.713
- MY GOD, I LOVE YOU.
- [sighs, moans]

25:20.750 --> 25:23.548
I KNEW YOU'D COME.
I JUST KNEW IT.

25:23.590 --> 25:25.114
HOW'D YOU KNOW I WAS HERE?

25:25.150 --> 25:27.584
- SPENCER--
HE HAD A VISION.

25:27.620 --> 25:30.657
I GOT TO SAY IT WAS
A PRETTY SPECTACULAR ONE.

25:30.690 --> 25:32.055
- COME ON.

25:32.090 --> 25:33.853
- I'M NEVER LETTING YOU
OUT OF MY SIGHT AGAIN.

25:33.900 --> 25:35.322
- [sighs]
- EVER.

25:35.360 --> 25:36.691
- DEAL.

25:36.730 --> 25:38.129
BUT NOT UNTIL AFTER THE WEDDING

25:38.170 --> 25:39.694
BECAUSE IT WOULD BE
REALLY BAD LUCK

25:39.730 --> 25:41.129
FOR YOU TO SEE ME
IN MY DRESS.

25:41.170 --> 25:43.195
OH, MY GOD,
WHAT TIME IS IT?

25:43.240 --> 25:44.400
- YEAH, WE HAVE
LESS THAN TWO HOURS,

25:44.440 --> 25:47.034
AND WE HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO DO,
SO YOU ARE COMING WITH ME.

25:47.070 --> 25:48.799
SEE YOU AT THE MEADOW.

25:48.840 --> 25:52.606
- GUARD HER WITH YOUR LIFE!
THAT'S NOT HYPERBOLE!

25:54.120 --> 25:55.576
GOOD WORK, SPENCER.

25:55.620 --> 25:57.315
I OWE YOU ONE.
- YEAH.

25:57.350 --> 25:59.841
LET'S GO GRAB THE FELLAS
AND SUIT UP.

26:20.170 --> 26:22.138
JUDAS PRIEST, STRODE.

26:22.180 --> 26:24.876
WHAT THE HEL'bﬁRE YOU DOING?

26:24.910 --> 26:26.070
WHEN YOU SAID
PUT ON YOUR SUIT,

26:26.110 --> 26:29.011
YOU DIDN'T MEAN WE WERE ALL
GOING FOR A DIP IN THE GROTTO?

26:29.050 --> 26:30.312
- WHY WOULD I POSSIBLY
MEAN THAT?

26:30.350 --> 26:32.011
- WELL, YOU WEREN'T
VERY SPECIFIC.

26:32.050 --> 26:33.756
MY SUIT SUIT IS ON THE BUS.

26:33.790 --> 26:35.314
- CHANGE ON THE WAY.
COME ON!

26:35.360 --> 26:36.611
[Woody shouts indistinctly]

26:36.660 --> 26:38.025
- LOSING HERB'S
GONNA LEAVE A MARK,

26:38.060 --> 26:39.220
BUT WITH AN A.P.B. OUT ON HIM,

26:39.260 --> 26:40.693
THERE'S NO WAY
HE'S GOING ANYWHERE.

26:40.730 --> 26:41.822
I WANT THOSE FILES.

26:41.860 --> 26:44.169
- YEAH?
SO DOES RIZZO.

27:10.830 --> 27:11.979
- I THINK HERB IS STILL HERE.

27:12.030 --> 27:13.281
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

27:13.330 --> 27:15.252
- THAT CRAl-TY FOX MAN.

27:15.300 --> 27:16.927
HE FIGURED THAT WE WOULD
ASSUME THAT HE WOULD RUN,

27:16.960 --> 27:18.393
SO HE STUCK AROUND.

27:18.430 --> 27:21.137
EITHER THAT, OR HE'S THE WORLD'S
BIGGEST MICHAEL DAMIAN FAN.

27:21.170 --> 27:22.728
- OR BOTH.
- [laughs]

27:22.770 --> 27:26.638
I AM ABOUT TO MAKE
LASSIE'S YEAR.

27:43.320 --> 27:44.856
- DID YOU MISS ME?

27:44.890 --> 27:47.029
- NOT PARTICULARLY.

27:49.060 --> 27:50.960
YOU KNOW,
I-I REALLY GOT TO PEE.

27:51.000 --> 27:54.834
- TRY NOT TO THINK
OF A WARM SUMMER'S RAIN.

27:54.870 --> 27:57.259
HENRY!
TAKE ME TO MY WEDDING.

28:03.180 --> 28:05.899
- UNCLE MAX?
GET READY TO BE HAPPY.

28:08.980 --> 28:10.208
- OH, I CAN FEEL
MY HEARTBEAT IN MY FACE.

28:10.250 --> 28:12.480
- WELL, YOU DID HAVE AT LEAST
SIX SHOTS OF TEQUILA LAST NIGHT.

28:12.520 --> 28:14.454
HOW ARE YOU FEELING?
- GOOD.

28:14.490 --> 28:18.153
I GUESS I JUST NEEDED
A LITTLE BIT OF ME TIME.

28:18.190 --> 28:20.454
THE TRUTH IS, THE WHOLE TIME
THAT I WAS STUCK IN THERE,

28:20.490 --> 28:22.321
I NEVER PANICKED, NOT ONCE.

28:22.360 --> 28:25.022
I JUST KNEW CARLTON
WAS GONNA COME.

28:25.070 --> 28:27.891
I FELT SAFE,
IF THAT MAKES ANY SENSE.

28:27.940 --> 28:29.293
AND THEN IT HIT ME.

28:29.340 --> 28:32.503
CARLTON IS ALWAYS GOING
TO BE THERE...

28:32.540 --> 28:33.438
ALWAYS.

28:33.470 --> 28:36.735
I NEVER HAVE TO WORRY
ABOUT LOSING HIM.

28:36.780 --> 28:38.372
- UNLESS HIS ASS GETS SHOT.

28:38.410 --> 28:39.308
- OH.

28:39.350 --> 28:41.511
- YOU KNOW WHAT?
BUT THAT'S WHY THE PO-PO

28:41.550 --> 28:43.370
BE WEARING THEM
BULLETPROOF VESTS, GIRL.

28:43.420 --> 28:44.944
- ALL RIGHT.
- IT'S ALL GOOD.

28:44.990 --> 28:46.742
- YEAH.

28:46.790 --> 28:50.351
- YOU HAVE TO KNOW
YOU MAKE HIM SO HAPPY.

28:50.390 --> 28:54.759
I HAVE NEVER SEEN HIM
THIS FULL OF LIFE AND HOPE.

28:54.800 --> 28:57.360
- LOOK, IT'S GONNA BE HARD.

28:57.400 --> 28:59.368
I MEAN, THERE WILL BE DAYS
THAT YOU JUST WANT TO HOP

28:59.400 --> 29:01.334
ON A PLANE
TO THE SOUTH OF FRANCE

29:01.370 --> 29:06.034
AND MEET A YOUNG WINEMAKER
ON A BICYCLE.

29:06.070 --> 29:08.209
OH, AND ALL HE WANTS TO DO
IS COOK FOR YOU

29:08.240 --> 29:09.935
AND MAKE LOVE.

29:09.980 --> 29:13.916
BUT THEN THERE WILL BE
THOSE DAYS

29:13.950 --> 29:17.078
WHEN YOU ARE SICK IN BED,
AND HE'LL RUB YOUR FEET,

29:17.120 --> 29:18.815
OR HE'LL TRY TO MAKE
YOU EGGS FLORENTINE

29:18.850 --> 29:21.910
FROM A RECIPE
THAT HE FOUND ONLINE...

29:21.960 --> 29:25.418
OH, OR THAT DAY WHEN HE WALKS
INTO YOUR HOSPITAL ROOM

29:25.460 --> 29:26.882
HOLDING YOUR NEWBORN SON,

29:26.930 --> 29:29.819
AND HE WILL HIM LAY GENTLY
ON YOUR CHEST,

29:29.860 --> 29:32.420
AND HE TELLS YOU
THAT YOU LOOK BEAUTIFUL,

29:32.470 --> 29:35.189
EVEN THOUGH YOU KNOW YOU LOOK
LIKE HELL FROZEN OVER...

29:35.240 --> 29:36.559
[cell phone rings]

29:36.600 --> 29:40.559
AND IT ALL WILL BE WORTH IT.

29:40.610 --> 29:42.430
- HOW THE HELL MY PAROLE OFFICER
GONNA CALL ME

29:42.480 --> 29:46.439
WHEN I'M TRYING
TO PUT MY FACE ON?

29:46.480 --> 29:48.539
WHAT YOU WANT, TRENICE?

29:55.960 --> 29:59.157
- AND I PROMISE NEVER TO CLONE
YOUR CELL PHONE...

29:59.190 --> 30:01.351
MY PRINCESS.

30:01.400 --> 30:03.527
- [laughs]
THERE IT IS.

30:03.560 --> 30:07.326
NOW IT SINGS.
[chuckles]

30:07.370 --> 30:09.861
- MADELINE AND I
DIDN'T WRITE OUR OWN VOWS.

30:09.900 --> 30:11.299
SHE WANTED TO,

30:11.340 --> 30:13.467
BUT I WAS MY USUAL, STUBBORN,
TRADITIONAL SELF.

30:13.510 --> 30:15.478
- SURE HOPE YOU DRAI-TED
A PRENUP.

30:15.510 --> 30:16.329
- SHUT UP, HERB.

30:16.380 --> 30:19.042
IF YOU KNEW
THE PURE, CELESTIAL LOVE

30:19.080 --> 30:22.277
THAT I HAVE SURRENDERED TO,
YOU WOULDN'T WORRY ABOUT MONEY.

30:22.320 --> 30:24.049
PLUS, JUST SHUT UP.

30:24.090 --> 30:25.614
- I THOUGHT I KNEW THAT LOVE.

30:25.650 --> 30:29.256
IT TURNS OUT I MISTOOK IT
FOR A SOULLESS CONCUBINE

30:29.290 --> 30:33.454
WHO CHEATED ON ME 12 TIMES
WITH 10 MEN.

30:33.490 --> 30:35.594
WHAT?
OH, H HAVE A NATURAL PART.

30:35.630 --> 30:37.996
WHY FIGHT IT?
[man retchIng]

30:38.030 --> 30:40.521
- WAIT. SO THAT GUY
WHO'S VOMITING JELL-O

30:40.570 --> 30:42.060
IS YOUR BEST MAN?

30:42.100 --> 30:44.409
SERIOUSLY?
- DIDN'T I TELL YOU TO SHUT UP?

30:44.440 --> 30:45.532
- HERB IS RIGHT, LASSIE.

30:45.570 --> 30:47.458
I MEAN, YOUR BEST FRIEND
IS A TOOL.

30:47.510 --> 30:49.375
- GRADE-A D-BAG, NO QUESTION.

30:49.410 --> 30:51.298
- HE'S NOT MY BEST FRIEND, OKAY?

30:51.350 --> 30:53.079
HE'S NOT MY BOY.
HE'S NOT MY MAN.

30:53.110 --> 30:55.112
I HAVEN'T SEEN THE GUY
SINCE HIGH SCHOOL.

30:55.150 --> 30:57.118
HE WAS THE ONLY OTHER MEMBER
OF THE ANTI-GLEE CLUB

30:57.150 --> 30:58.378
THAT BOTHERED TO COME
TO MEETINGS.

30:58.420 --> 31:00.149
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I DON'T NEED TO EXPLAIN MYSELF.

31:00.190 --> 31:02.158
- WHY WOULD YOU LIE
ABOUT SOMETHING LIKE THAT?

31:02.190 --> 31:05.557
- BECAUSE
I WAS EMBARRASSED, OKAY?

31:05.590 --> 31:07.182
IT'S EMBARRASSING
THAT I DIDN'T HAVE SOMEBODY

31:07.230 --> 31:10.449
THAT I WAS SUPER TIGHT WITH
TO ASK TO MY BACHELOR PARTY.

31:10.500 --> 31:12.320
THAT'S WHY I DIDN'T WANT ONE,

31:12.370 --> 31:17.194
AND YOU TWO NINNIES GO
AND CALL MY BLUFF, AND...

31:17.240 --> 31:19.208
JACKASS' NAME
IS THE FIRST THING

31:19.240 --> 31:21.470
THAT POPPED INTO MY HEAD,
SO I JUST--I ROLLED WITH IT.

31:21.510 --> 31:24.343
- BRINGS ME SO MUCH RELIEF
TO HEAR YOU SAY THAT.

31:24.380 --> 31:25.472
- SO GIVE HIM YOUR PITY,
NOT ME,

31:25.510 --> 31:27.501
BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHAT?

31:27.550 --> 31:30.144
I'M HAPPY WITH WHO I AM.

31:30.180 --> 31:34.412
BESIDES,
BROMANCES ARE OVERRATED.

31:34.460 --> 31:36.382
MARLOWE GIVES ME
ALL THE COMPANIONSHIP

31:36.420 --> 31:37.956
I WILL EVER NEED.

31:37.990 --> 31:41.118
NOW, THAT BEING SAID...

31:41.160 --> 31:44.129
I DO APPRECIATE THE GESTURE.

31:44.170 --> 31:45.626
GENTLEM EN.

31:47.430 --> 31:50.467
- BUT WHAT I'M ASKING FOR HERE
IS A FAVOR.

31:50.500 --> 31:53.367
BIG WENDY
IS THE MAID OF HONOR.

31:53.410 --> 31:55.332
- WHAT KIND OF PAROLE OFFICER
ARE YOU, TRENICE?

31:55.380 --> 31:57.632
UH-UH! SEE, I COULD'VE LIED
MY BUTT OFF, YOU KNOW?

31:57.680 --> 31:59.705
BUT I TOLD THE TRUTH,
AND THIS HOW YOU DO ME?

31:59.750 --> 32:01.638
YOU JUST MAD
'CAUSE I'M A FULL-FIGURED WOMAN.

32:01.680 --> 32:03.568
AND YOU STARVING.
YA HUNGRY!

32:03.620 --> 32:06.589
- NOW, AS I WAS SAYING,
I CAN PERSONALLY GUARANTEE

32:06.620 --> 32:09.350
THAT SHE WILL NOT LEAVE MY SIGHT
OR TOUCH ANOTHER DROP OF ALCOHOL

32:09.390 --> 32:11.585
FOR THE REMAINDER
OF THE EVENING.

32:11.630 --> 32:13.450
"WELL, WHAT IS GOOD ENOUGH?"

32:13.490 --> 32:16.493
SAID THE CHIEF OF POLICE.

32:16.530 --> 32:18.191
- YOU'RE JUSTICE OF THE PEACE
IS A DRUNK?

32:18.230 --> 32:19.299
- HE'S NOT ANSWERING
HIS CELL PHONE,

32:19.330 --> 32:22.197
AND APPARENTLY NO ONE
HAS SEEN HIM SINCE MAY DAY!

32:22.240 --> 32:24.037
WHAT THE HELL
AM I SUPPOSED TO DO NOW?

32:24.070 --> 32:26.061
- UM...
- I'M LICENSED.

32:26.110 --> 32:28.078
- ZIP IT!
WAIT. WHAT?

32:28.110 --> 32:29.429
- YEAH, I'M A LICENSED
JUSTICE OF THE PEACE.

32:29.480 --> 32:30.606
I COULD MARRY YOU.

32:30.640 --> 32:32.198
- WHY THE HELL
DIDN'T YOU SAY THAT BEFORE?

32:32.250 --> 32:33.979
- BECAUSE YOU KEEP TELLING ME
TO SHUT UP,

32:34.020 --> 32:37.239
AND YOU HANDCUFFED ME TO
A BEDPOST AND A STRIPPER POLE.

32:37.280 --> 32:39.316
- HERB, I COULD KISS YOU
RIGHT NOW.

32:39.350 --> 32:41.409
- ALL RIGHT.
- COME WITH ME!

32:43.760 --> 32:45.250
- [chuckles]

32:45.290 --> 32:47.281
- FORTUITOUS.
- YEAH.

32:47.330 --> 32:49.457
YEAH.

32:53.370 --> 32:55.463
- BUZZ! WHY ARE YOU STILL
WEARING THAT?

32:55.500 --> 32:56.990
- I HAD TO COME STRAIGHT
FROM MY OTHER GIG.

32:57.040 --> 32:58.234
NICE DAY, HUH?

32:58.270 --> 32:59.567
- WHERE'S FRAN NY?

32:59.610 --> 33:01.635
- I DIDN'T GET A PLUS-ONE.

33:01.680 --> 33:04.774
- HUH.
[bird squawks]

33:04.810 --> 33:06.744

OH, SON OF A--

33:13.050 --> 33:15.553

33:15.590 --> 33:17.717
HI, LADIES.
- HI.

33:17.760 --> 33:20.228
I WISH I HAD TWO MOMS...

33:20.260 --> 33:22.023
OR ONE, FOR THAT MATTER.

33:25.500 --> 33:27.468
- OKAY, HERE WE GO.

33:27.500 --> 33:29.036
- IS THIS REALLY NECESSARY?

33:29.070 --> 33:30.765
- JUST SMILE,
AND WE'LL GET THROUGH THIS.

33:30.800 --> 33:31.630
- SHE'S NOT EVEN HERE.

33:31.670 --> 33:33.661
- [sighs]
- I FEEL LIKE KUNTA KINTE.

- OH.
- THAT'S--THAT'S HAPPENING.

34:39.410 --> 34:41.503
- CALL ME.

34:48.920 --> 34:50.876
- YOU OKAY, BABE?

34:50.920 --> 34:55.311
NOW, WHERE WERE WE?

34:55.360 --> 34:57.214
MARLOWE VICCELLIO,
YOU HAVE GIVEN ME

34:57.260 --> 34:58.727
SOMETHING TO BELIEVE IN

34:58.760 --> 35:01.354
EVEN STRONGER
THAN THE NRA'S CODE OF ETHICS.

I LOVE YOU,
NOW AND FOR ALL ETERNITY.

VESTED IN ME

35:30.890 --> 35:34.496

I DESERVE THIS, DAMN IT.

36:58.580 --> 37:00.548

THE COMMON DECENCY

37:00.580 --> 37:03.344
TO WASH IT DOWN WITH A FRESH
FLUTE OF--WHAT IS THAT?

37:03.380 --> 37:04.642
- PROSECCO.

BETTER PUT YOUR ARMS IN THERE.
YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO USE THEM.

37:36.050 --> 37:37.847
I GOT TO ADMIT,
I DID NOT SEE THAT COMING.

AI-TER ALL THESE YEARS, HUH?

I'LL TELL YOU, WHEN IT'S GOOD,
THERE'S NOTHING LIKE IT--

37:46.990 --> 37:48.890
JUST PURE, UNCOMPLICATED.

37:48.930 --> 37:51.023
- "UNCOMPLICATED"?

37:51.060 --> 37:52.925
CAN'T SAY I'M FAMILIAR
WITH THAT CONCEPT.

A SPENCER.

37:54.640 --> 37:56.460
THANK YOU.
IT'S IN YOUR DNA.

WE INSTINCT IVELY MAKE THINGS
AS DIFFICULT FOR OURSELVES

37:58.910 --> 37:59.968
AS POSSIBLE.

38:00.010 --> 38:04.344
YOU KNOW, YOUR MOTHER--
SHE WANTED TO SEE THE WORLD.

38:04.380 --> 38:08.942
THAT WAS HER ONE BIG THING,
TO SEE THE WORLD.

38:08.980 --> 38:10.470
DID WE EVER TAKE A TRIP?

38:10.520 --> 38:14.388
- NO.
- NO.

38:14.420 --> 38:16.081
BY THE TIME I WISED UP,
IT WAS TOO LATE.

38:16.120 --> 38:19.089
- YOU'RE LIKE
THE OLD GUY IN UP.

38:19.130 --> 38:20.950
- EXCEPT YOUR MOTHER'S
STILL ALIVE.

38:20.990 --> 38:22.821
- WHAT'S HAPPENING RIGHT NOW?

38:22.860 --> 38:26.990
- I'M JUST SAYING IT'D BE NICE
TO SEE YOU BREAK THE CYCLE.

38:39.450 --> 38:42.419
- NO.
[clears throat]

38:45.650 --> 38:46.514
- WHERE'S YOURS?

38:46.550 --> 38:48.711
- I DID A SHOT OF ABSINTHE
AT THE BAR.

38:48.760 --> 38:50.751
- SHAWN, I NEED
TO ASK YOU SOMETHING,

38:50.790 --> 38:54.692
AND I'M SURE THIS IS JUST ME
OVERTHINKING THINGS,

38:54.730 --> 38:58.860
BUT, UM, YESTERDAY
YOU WERE AT THE HOTEL.

38:58.900 --> 39:02.097
YOU SAW THE HALLWAYS.
YOU KNOW THE LAYOUT.

39:02.140 --> 39:04.062
- GUILTY AS CHARGED.

39:04.100 --> 39:05.931
- WELL, YOU SAID THAT YOU HAD

39:05.970 --> 39:09.633
THIS SPECTACULAR VISION

39:09.680 --> 39:13.002
THAT MARLOWE WAS COVERED
IN GARBAGE.

39:13.050 --> 39:16.417
BUT COULDN'T YOU HAVE
JUST REMEMBERED

39:16.450 --> 39:19.089
THAT THERE WAS A TRASH CHUTE
ON EVERY FLOOR

39:19.120 --> 39:21.759
AND THEN TAKEN A GUESS?

39:21.790 --> 39:24.953
- UH...YEAH.

39:24.990 --> 39:26.423
I-I SUPPOSE SO,

39:26.460 --> 39:28.951
BUT THAT WOULD'VE BEEN
A PRETTY WILD GUESS,

39:29.000 --> 39:30.558
DON'T YOU THINK?

39:30.600 --> 39:32.090
- ABSOLUTELY, AND, YOU KNOW,

39:32.130 --> 39:35.065
I PROBABLY WOULDN'T HAVE GIVEN
IT A SECOND THOUGHT,

39:35.100 --> 39:39.730
BUT THEN THERE WAS THIS.

39:46.610 --> 39:49.841
AND I AM SURE THERE'S
AN EXPLANATION, BUT YOU KNOW ME.

39:49.880 --> 39:51.814
I WON'T BE ABLE TO STOP
THINKING ABOUT IT,

39:51.850 --> 39:53.488
AND I CERTAINLY WON'T BE ABLE
TO WANG CHUNG

39:53.520 --> 39:55.579
UNTIL WE CLEAR IT UP.

39:57.460 --> 40:00.952
LASSITER SAID
YOU HAD A VISION

40:00.990 --> 40:03.754
OF HERB WITH MICHAEL DAMIAN,

40:03.800 --> 40:07.019
BUT YOU HAD THIS RECEIPT,

40:07.070 --> 40:11.439
SO YOU KNEW
HERB WOULD BE THERE,

40:11.470 --> 40:14.473
RIGHT?

40:30.920 --> 40:33.684
MAYBE THE BEST THINGS...

40:33.730 --> 40:36.619
THE RICHEST THINGS

40:36.660 --> 40:39.163
AREN'T SUPPOSED TO COME EASILY,

40:39.200 --> 40:41.760
AND THAT SOMETIMES THE MOMENTS
THAT MAKE THE MOST SENSE

40:41.800 --> 40:44.837
HAPPEN WHEN
EVERYTHING ELSE DOESN'T.

40:47.640 --> 40:50.837
SHAWN,
ARE YOU LISTENING TO ME?

40:50.880 --> 40:54.611
- FALLING IN LOVE WITH YOU WAS
NEVER PART OF THE PLAN, OKAY?

40:54.650 --> 40:56.845
THIS WHOLE THING STARTED
BECAUSE MY ASS

40:56.880 --> 40:58.939
WAS ON THE LINE.

40:58.990 --> 41:01.140
SELF-PRESERVATION, JULES--
YOU GOT TO UNDERSTAND THAT.

41:01.190 --> 41:03.215
I DIDN'T HAVE A CHOICE.

41:04.890 --> 41:07.256
AND THEN...

41:07.290 --> 41:11.124
WE SORT OF FOUND A GROOVE,

41:11.160 --> 41:15.233
AND BY THE TIME YOU SHOWED UP,
IT WAS SO MUCH FUN.

41:15.270 --> 41:16.134
[chuckles]

41:16.170 --> 41:19.958
I PUT AWAY,
LIKE, OVER 100 CRIMINALS.

41:20.010 --> 41:21.773
MOST OF THEM WERE MURDERERS.

41:28.180 --> 41:31.786
I'M GOOD AT WHAT I DO.

41:31.820 --> 41:34.550
AND WHAT I DO...

41:36.920 --> 41:39.855
IT'S GOOD...

41:39.890 --> 41:41.790
ISN'T IT?

41:41.830 --> 41:45.095
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

41:46.830 --> 41:51.062
ARE YOU TELLING ME
THIS IS ALL A LIE?

41:51.100 --> 41:52.863
- PLEASE DON'T MAKE ME
ANSWER THAT.

41:52.910 --> 41:56.971
- OH, MY GOD.

41:57.010 --> 41:59.001
[sniffles] OH, MY GOD,
I FEEL SO STUPID.

41:59.050 --> 42:00.972
- NO, SWEETH EART.

42:01.010 --> 42:02.716
NO, THIS...

42:02.750 --> 42:06.641
THIS IS ALL ME.

42:06.690 --> 42:08.510
THIS--

42:12.830 --> 42:14.695
- LET ME CALL YOU BACK.
