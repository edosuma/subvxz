03:22.161 --> 03:26.097
- Willy, what are you doing downtown?
- I'm working. What are you doing?

03:26.206 --> 03:29.350
He's working. Ha-ha-ha. He's working.

03:40.971 --> 03:42.196
I hate them.

03:42.306 --> 03:46.534
I hate Frumpies potato chips so much,
I can't stop eating them.

03:46.643 --> 03:49.870
And I keep eating Frumpies
until I love them...

03:50.606 --> 03:52.540
which I hope is never.

03:53.150 --> 03:54.709
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

03:54.818 --> 03:57.878
Thank you very much, Mr. Bell.
Mr. Gilbert is next.

03:57.988 --> 03:59.046
Right.

03:59.823 --> 04:01.382
Mr. Gilbert!

04:01.491 --> 04:04.176
I mean, I think the accent
could work for us.

04:04.286 --> 04:06.220
Bearing in mind the...
business, you know.

04:06.330 --> 04:08.347
- Hello.
- Hi. How are you?

04:08.457 --> 04:09.557
Fine, thank you.

04:09.666 --> 04:11.809
Mr. Gilbert,
this is our director, Mr. Walsk...

04:11.919 --> 04:14.770
Mr. Blair, Mr. Ott, Miss Baker,
and Miss Hall.

04:14.880 --> 04:16.772
- You saw the copy?
- I looked through it.

04:16.882 --> 04:18.524
Whenever you're ready.

04:18.716 --> 04:21.110
Boy! I hate them!

04:21.386 --> 04:26.073
I hate Frumpies potato chips so much,
I can't stop eating them.

04:26.266 --> 04:30.077
And I'll keep on eating Frumpies
till I love them...

04:30.270 --> 04:32.371
which, I hope, will be never.

04:34.942 --> 04:37.585
Would you mind
eating the potato chip, please?

04:37.694 --> 04:39.754
I can't. I got gallstones.

04:41.281 --> 04:42.465
Right.

04:43.033 --> 04:46.260
- Uh, okay, thank you for your....
- Willy Clark?

04:50.249 --> 04:52.308
Give me five more minutes.
He's on his way.

04:52.417 --> 04:55.102
- He left 20 minutes ago.
- He's 40 minutes late already.

04:55.212 --> 04:57.480
If he's not here by 11:00, forget it.

04:59.091 --> 05:01.108
Crazy freaking old man!

05:18.819 --> 05:19.919
Sir.

05:20.737 --> 05:22.254
Hey.

05:22.698 --> 05:24.465
- Hey.
- Hey.

05:25.033 --> 05:27.093
- What is it?
- I'm here. Willy Clark.

05:27.202 --> 05:29.762
- So?
- Willy Clark. I'm here.

05:31.498 --> 05:34.225
- Here to pick up a car?
- What?

05:35.669 --> 05:39.146
- You here to pick up a car?
- What do I need a car for?

05:39.256 --> 05:41.857
- Then what do you want?
- I'm here. The potato chips.

05:41.967 --> 05:44.485
I'm here for the potato chip commercial.
Willy Clark.

05:44.594 --> 05:45.986
This is a garage.

05:46.096 --> 05:48.364
- What is this?
- Let me see that.

05:48.473 --> 05:51.951
- This looks like a garage to me.
- Is this the address you're looking for?

05:52.060 --> 05:54.412
- Yeah.
- The Danzig Advertising Agency?

05:54.521 --> 05:56.705
- That's it.
- 354 East 43rd Street.

05:56.815 --> 05:59.083
This is West 43rd. You want East.

05:59.192 --> 06:02.420
- This is not the agency?
- You didn't hear what I just said?

06:02.529 --> 06:04.588
This is West Side.
You want the East Side.

06:04.698 --> 06:08.843
Is my nephew here? Ben Clark?
He'll fix it. I don't handle the business.

06:08.952 --> 06:12.513
What are you, deaf or something?
Look, you got to go across town.

06:12.622 --> 06:15.015
I don't make commercials.
I fix transmissions.

06:15.125 --> 06:16.350
Why don't you take a look?

06:16.460 --> 06:18.561
Maybe in the back
they make the commercials.

06:18.670 --> 06:23.357
- Pops, take a walk. I'm very busy.
- It wouldn't kill you to look, would it?

06:23.633 --> 06:27.194
East! East 43rd Street,
for Christ's sake. East!

06:27.304 --> 06:28.571
Aah! Don't get fresh with me!

06:28.680 --> 06:31.740
I got a few years on you
before you get fresh with me.

06:32.309 --> 06:34.076
Sends me to a garage.

06:38.982 --> 06:41.167
Right! Turn it to the right!

06:42.986 --> 06:45.546
The right! Turn it
to the right! Pull it!

06:54.122 --> 06:58.058
The other way! East! East!

07:00.504 --> 07:03.439
Don't tell me!
I've lived in New York all my life!

07:06.051 --> 07:07.943
Okay, very nice. Thank you.

07:09.012 --> 07:10.446
- Is that it?
- That's it.

07:10.555 --> 07:12.907
There's one no-show, Willy Clark.
You wanna wait?

07:13.016 --> 07:15.743
No way. The man can't remember lines.

07:15.852 --> 07:18.078
Drove me crazy last year
with the corn flakes.

07:18.188 --> 07:20.789
My first choice would be the guy
with the Kraut accent.

07:20.899 --> 07:24.960
He's here. He just got here.
He got held up in traffic. I told you.

07:25.362 --> 07:28.589
Uncle Willy, in here. Where were you?
You're over an hour late!

07:28.698 --> 07:32.259
I was on time. You sent me over
to a garage all the way on the West Side.

07:32.369 --> 07:34.762
- Who told you to go to there?
- It's on the paper.

07:34.871 --> 07:36.722
No, it isn't. It says East 43rd.

07:36.832 --> 07:38.942
I didn't trust you.
You always make mistakes.

07:39.042 --> 07:41.685
I've got three minutes left.
Do you wanna try this once?

07:41.795 --> 07:43.979
- Who's this?
- This is Mr. Walsk. He's the director.

07:44.089 --> 07:46.440
- Mr. Walsk, Willy Clark.
- How do you do? I'm Willy Clark.

07:46.550 --> 07:48.526
We met. You auditioned for me last year.

07:48.635 --> 07:51.654
I don't remember that.
When was that? Last year?

07:52.055 --> 07:53.697
Yes, that was last year.

07:53.807 --> 07:57.826
Mr. Clark, I am very short on time here.
I literally have about three minutes...

07:57.936 --> 08:00.204
so if you'd like to do it once,
that's about it.

08:00.313 --> 08:03.082
I'm ready. I know the whole thing.
Anytime you say.

08:03.191 --> 08:06.460
- Just give me 10 minutes.
- I don't have 10 minutes, Mr. Clark.

08:06.570 --> 08:07.711
He's ready, Mr. Walsk.

08:07.821 --> 08:11.799
If you'll just stand right over there,
where everyone can see you.

08:11.992 --> 08:13.342
- There.
- Where?

08:13.660 --> 08:15.469
- There is fine.
- Over here?

08:15.579 --> 08:16.637
Yes.

08:17.330 --> 08:20.015
How about over here?
The light is better here.

08:20.125 --> 08:22.560
Don't worry about the light.
We're not shooting yet.

08:22.669 --> 08:24.144
I can see you fine there.

08:24.254 --> 08:25.604
You're the director.

08:25.714 --> 08:29.400
I just thought that maybe
you'd like it better over there.

08:30.677 --> 08:32.278
Give him the bag.

08:33.804 --> 08:34.989
What's this?

08:35.097 --> 08:38.284
It's the product, Mr. Clark.
The potato chips.

08:42.022 --> 08:44.873
You got a fresher bag?
This one is soggy.

08:45.150 --> 08:48.836
Mr. Clark, I have three minutes left.
Do you want to do this or not?

08:48.945 --> 08:50.838
He's only got three minutes.

08:50.947 --> 08:54.133
I heard the man. I'm not deaf.
I'm a professional.

08:54.242 --> 08:57.136
I'm ready whenever he's ready,
but the bag was soggy.

08:57.245 --> 08:59.263
Okay, Mr. Clark, I'm ready.

08:59.372 --> 09:02.558
Now, if you'll take a bite
of the potato chip and read the copy.

09:02.667 --> 09:04.351
- The what?
- The copy.

09:04.461 --> 09:07.187
They didn't give you the copy?
You didn't give it to him?

09:07.297 --> 09:10.316
- The lines, Uncle Willy.
- The lines. Certainly.

09:10.425 --> 09:13.360
Why didn't he say so?
I didn't know what the hell copy was.

09:13.470 --> 09:14.737
You ready?

09:14.971 --> 09:18.365
I'm ready. I swear to God I'm ready.

09:19.100 --> 09:22.077
Just bite the potato chip
and begin, please.

09:40.622 --> 09:43.724
- What do I say?
- Forget it. Thank you very much, Mr. Clark.

09:43.833 --> 09:46.602
Get me the guy with the beard,
or the Kraut. Doesn't matter.

09:46.711 --> 09:48.771
Mr. Clark, a real pleasure
seeing you again.

09:48.880 --> 09:50.898
- Thank you very much.
- Please, Mr. Walsk.

09:51.007 --> 09:54.026
As a favor to me, let him read through
the commercial one time.

09:54.135 --> 09:58.364
By the time he finishes reading,
potatoes will be an endangered species.

09:58.765 --> 10:01.867
- I'm ready again. I remembered.
- I don't care!

10:03.937 --> 10:07.081
Just as a courtesy. He was
one of the biggest stars in vaudeville.

10:07.190 --> 10:08.624
He deserves one reading.

10:08.733 --> 10:11.085
If the man can't work,
why doesn't he retire?

10:11.194 --> 10:15.631
Mr. Walsk, don't do this to me.
Please. I'll pay you to let him read.

10:15.740 --> 10:17.883
Once. Let him read through it,
and that's it.

10:17.993 --> 10:22.096
- And I'll be damned if I'll listen.
- Here, Uncle Willy. Read it from this.

10:22.205 --> 10:25.140
- I don't need it. I remember the lines.
- Read it!

10:25.250 --> 10:28.268
- Get out, Ben, I got my own copy.
- Where is it?

10:32.340 --> 10:33.565
Where did I put it?

10:33.675 --> 10:36.151
Here. Just read it through once
and don't stop, okay?

10:36.261 --> 10:38.696
You don't have to tell me.
I'm a professional.

10:38.805 --> 10:40.864
I'm in this business 57 years.

10:41.474 --> 10:45.244
- Sends me to a garage.
- Okay, Mr. Clark.

10:51.151 --> 10:52.626
I hate them.

10:53.236 --> 10:56.046
- I hate Chumpies potato chips...
- Frumpies.

10:59.034 --> 11:00.467
I hate them.

11:00.910 --> 11:03.971
- I hate Frunchies potato chips so much...
- Frumpies!

11:05.749 --> 11:08.851
- Frunkies potato chips...
- Frumpies!

11:08.960 --> 11:11.270
Can't you just say "Frumpies"?

11:11.546 --> 11:13.939
If it was funny, I would say it.

11:19.679 --> 11:21.238
So, what do you think?

11:21.765 --> 11:22.865
About what?

11:22.974 --> 11:26.076
The money. How much money
you think they want to pay me?

11:26.353 --> 11:27.453
Who?

11:27.562 --> 11:30.539
The potato chips. I'm not doing it
unless the money is right.

11:30.649 --> 11:32.416
You think they're going to hire you?

11:32.525 --> 11:35.502
You come an hour late,
can't remember the address or the lines.

11:35.612 --> 11:36.920
I remembered the lines.

11:37.030 --> 11:39.339
The name of the potato chips
I couldn't remember.

11:39.449 --> 11:41.008
- What was it again?
- Frumpies.

11:41.117 --> 11:43.510
- Say it again.
- Frumpies!

11:44.204 --> 11:47.514
Still can't remember it
'cause it's not funny.

11:47.666 --> 11:50.893
I'm in this business 57 years.
You learn a few things.

11:51.336 --> 11:53.479
You know what makes an audience laugh.

11:53.588 --> 11:56.190
You know which words are funny
and which words are not.

11:56.299 --> 11:59.485
You told me 100 times.
I have to get to the office.

11:59.594 --> 12:01.862
- Which words are funny?
- Words with a "K" in it.

12:01.971 --> 12:03.322
I have to get to the office.

12:03.431 --> 12:05.991
Words with a "K" in it.
You didn't know that, did you?

12:06.101 --> 12:08.160
I'll tell you which words
always get a laugh.

12:08.269 --> 12:09.953
- "Alka-Seltzer"?
- "Alka-Seltzer" is funny.

12:10.063 --> 12:11.538
- "Chicken"?
- "Chicken" is funny.

12:11.648 --> 12:13.791
- "Pickle."
- "Pickle" is funny.

12:17.153 --> 12:18.629
All with a "K."

12:18.738 --> 12:21.131
"L's" are not funny.
"M's" are not funny.

12:21.241 --> 12:23.842
- Just "K's." I know.
- "Cupcake" is funny.

12:23.952 --> 12:26.386
"Tomatoes" is not funny.
"Lettuce" is not funny.

12:26.496 --> 12:28.639
You've explained that to me
since I was five.

12:28.748 --> 12:31.475
- I've got to get back to the office.
- "Cucumber" is funny.

12:31.584 --> 12:34.394
It's getting cold out.
I'm gonna give you money. Take a cab.

12:34.504 --> 12:36.480
- "Cab" is funny.
- Are you listening to me?

12:36.589 --> 12:39.149
"Cockroach" is funny.
Not getting them, saying them.

12:39.259 --> 12:42.027
- Will you listen to me?
- A little respect.

12:42.137 --> 12:44.738
How about some respect for me?
I'm also a human being.

12:44.848 --> 12:47.115
We'll see. You're young.
You got time yet.

13:14.586 --> 13:17.896
- Please cut that out.
- Can I have my mail, please?

13:20.550 --> 13:23.068
Please cut it out!
How many times I have to tell you?

13:23.178 --> 13:25.779
Don't hit the bell.
What's the matter con you?

13:26.055 --> 13:28.740
Give me my mail, I won't hit the bell.

13:32.353 --> 13:34.955
- No mail.
- What do you mean, no mail?

13:35.231 --> 13:39.042
I say no mail. What's the matter?
Don't you understand English?

13:39.360 --> 13:41.378
When you speak it, I'll understand it.

13:43.406 --> 13:46.967
"What's the matter con you?" Chumpies.

13:47.911 --> 13:49.928
Glunkies. I hate them.

13:50.371 --> 13:51.889
Klunkies....

13:52.332 --> 13:55.934
Tells me over there, the Spanish kid,
he tells me I have no mail.

13:56.044 --> 13:57.227
He probably stole it.

13:57.337 --> 14:01.315
They stole my shoes last week.
Three pairs of good shoes.

14:01.424 --> 14:04.568
Who would want your shoes?
I get important mail.

14:16.606 --> 14:18.123
We're stuck!

14:20.735 --> 14:22.127
Spanish kid!

14:22.529 --> 14:26.173
You live in a crappy hotel,
you get a crappy elevator!

14:49.597 --> 14:51.573
Aren't you going to answer it?

14:51.850 --> 14:54.660
It's him. 2:00 in the morning.

14:54.978 --> 14:57.537
- How do you know it's him?
- I know.

14:58.314 --> 15:01.541
- Listen to it.
- Ben, answer the phone!

15:03.486 --> 15:05.545
- Hello?
- Who's this? Ben?

15:05.738 --> 15:07.923
- What's wrong, Uncle Willy?
- That you, Ben?

15:08.032 --> 15:10.801
- You called me, didn't you?
- Don't yell.

15:11.452 --> 15:13.553
- Do you know what time it is?
- What?

15:13.663 --> 15:16.223
- Do you know what...
- You'll wake the children.

15:16.332 --> 15:18.141
Do you know what time it is?

15:19.168 --> 15:20.727
What time it is.

15:21.713 --> 15:22.980
15.

15:23.214 --> 15:25.816
10:15? Try 2:05.

15:26.009 --> 15:28.527
Why should I try 2:05 when it's 10:15?

15:28.636 --> 15:31.905
It's not 10:15!
It's 2:05 in the morning.

15:32.849 --> 15:35.575
You didn't wind your clock again today,
did you?

15:35.685 --> 15:39.746
No. So because you didn't wind your clock,
I have to get up at 2:00 in the morning.

15:39.856 --> 15:43.125
I'm sorry, I didn't realize.
Are you sleeping now?

15:44.903 --> 15:47.546
How could I be sleeping
when I'm up talking to you?

15:47.655 --> 15:50.757
So, as long as you're up,
did you hear from the potato chips?

15:50.867 --> 15:53.176
Yes. They said they're not interested.

15:53.578 --> 15:54.761
Positively?

15:55.413 --> 15:58.306
I'm sorry, Uncle Willy.
I'll keep looking, I promise.

15:58.416 --> 16:01.351
But not tonight.
Let's all get some sleep.

16:01.502 --> 16:04.104
I'll be up to see you Wednesday.
Helen sends her love.

16:04.213 --> 16:07.065
- Good night, Uncle Willy.
- When are you coming up? Wednesday?

16:07.175 --> 16:09.818
Yeah. Probably Wednesday.

16:11.554 --> 16:12.988
Good night, Willy.

16:14.891 --> 16:18.035
All right, I won't bother you anymore.
See you Wednesday.

16:18.144 --> 16:22.205
Don't forget my Variety and the cigars.
You listening?

16:23.024 --> 16:25.125
And tell the potato chips
I turned them down.

16:25.234 --> 16:27.377
I'm not interested anymore.

16:30.239 --> 16:32.007
To hell with all of them.

16:35.078 --> 16:38.096
We've got a deal,
if you think you can deliver them.

16:38.206 --> 16:39.973
They're both dying to work together.

16:40.083 --> 16:42.476
Nothing's come along until this
that's excited them.

16:42.585 --> 16:44.978
I'll have the contract signed
and on your desk by Monday.

16:45.630 --> 16:47.939
But when I think of what Jim
has done to Jessie....

16:48.049 --> 16:49.608
And he's not really sorry, I can tell.

16:49.717 --> 16:53.862
When a man is on alcohol,
he's a whole other person.

16:55.515 --> 16:56.708
He doesn't want to admit....

16:56.808 --> 16:58.492
Hello? Who's this?

17:01.521 --> 17:03.371
Never mind. It's the tea.

17:03.481 --> 17:07.125
He was drinking when I first knew him,
but it was never like this.

17:07.234 --> 17:09.961
And even now,
I suppose there are one or two days...

17:10.070 --> 17:12.881
when he doesn't take a drink
but I don't know....

17:14.575 --> 17:16.593
We'll be back with General Hospital...

17:16.703 --> 17:19.387
right after this brief message
from Lipton tea.

17:19.497 --> 17:21.807
Don't worry, I'm not going anyplace.

17:32.343 --> 17:35.070
Lipton blows the whistle

17:35.179 --> 17:38.073
You gotta have a cup of tea

17:38.182 --> 17:40.867
Listen to the Lipton whistle

17:40.977 --> 17:45.413
Brisk, brisk, brisk
Lipton tea

17:45.523 --> 17:48.750
And now for part three
of today's General Hospital.

17:49.235 --> 17:51.461
What happened to part two?
I miss part two?

17:55.491 --> 17:57.551
- Uncle Willy, it's me.
- Who's that?

17:57.660 --> 18:00.178
- Ben!
- Ben, is that you?

18:00.288 --> 18:03.682
- Yes, Willy, it's me. Ben. Open the door.
- Wait a minute.

18:10.506 --> 18:12.691
- Wait a minute.
- What's the matter?

18:13.718 --> 18:15.026
Wait a minute!

18:21.976 --> 18:25.412
- What's wrong?
- I'm locked in. The lock is broken.

18:25.521 --> 18:27.956
I'm locked in.
Go down and tell the Spanish kid.

18:28.066 --> 18:30.542
Tell him in Spanish.
They'll get somebody.

18:30.651 --> 18:32.919
It's not broken.
You just have to slide it out.

18:33.029 --> 18:34.629
- Don't force it.
- What?

18:34.989 --> 18:37.382
Uncle Willy, do you hear me?

18:37.492 --> 18:40.927
Don't try to.... Uncle Willy!
Do you hear me?

18:41.412 --> 18:43.889
Don't try to force, just slide it out.

18:45.583 --> 18:47.100
Don't force it.

18:51.547 --> 18:54.441
It's open. Never mind.
I fixed it myself.

18:55.301 --> 18:58.195
- You probably have to oil it.
- I think I have to oil it.

18:58.304 --> 19:00.280
I didn't think of that.

19:00.723 --> 19:04.784
Jesus. It's cold in here.
Don't they ever send up any steam?

19:04.894 --> 19:07.370
In July, they send up steam.

19:08.731 --> 19:11.041
What the hell is wrong with this?

19:12.568 --> 19:14.878
Come on, you piece of crap!
Work, already!

19:14.987 --> 19:17.172
Uncle Willy, I have to talk to you.

19:18.241 --> 19:22.052
Lousy Japs. They lost the war,
so they send us their junk.

19:22.578 --> 19:24.846
I have to talk to you.
It's very important.

19:24.956 --> 19:27.224
I just came
from the most exciting meeting....

19:27.333 --> 19:28.808
- What are you doing?
- What?

19:28.918 --> 19:31.144
The doctor said
you can't smoke cigars anymore.

19:31.254 --> 19:34.147
Who's smoking?
Do you see smoke coming from the cigar?

19:34.257 --> 19:37.692
- But you got it in your mouth.
- I'm rehearsing. I'll do the show later.

19:38.052 --> 19:41.821
- ABC called me this....
- How do you like that? Sol Burton died.

19:42.056 --> 19:44.407
- Who?
- Sol Burton, songwriter.

19:44.725 --> 19:48.161
89 years old, and he went
just like that, from nothing.

19:48.271 --> 19:49.496
Anyway, ABC called me...

19:49.605 --> 19:52.332
You know what kind of songs
he wrote? Shit.

19:52.984 --> 19:55.627
Lady, lady, be my baby

19:56.112 --> 19:59.673
"Lady" rhymes with "baby."
No wonder he's dead.

19:59.782 --> 20:01.841
Will you put down Variety
and listen to me?

20:01.951 --> 20:04.511
I left three clients in my office
so I could come here.

20:04.620 --> 20:07.305
That makes four of us out of work.
How's the children?

20:07.415 --> 20:09.224
Since when are you interested
in my children?

20:09.333 --> 20:12.143
You haven't seen them in a year.
You don't even remember their names.

20:12.253 --> 20:15.689
- Milly and Sidney.
- Amanda and Michael.

20:16.007 --> 20:18.733
What's the matter?
You didn't like Milly and Sidney?

20:18.843 --> 20:20.694
You forgot, so you made something up.

20:20.803 --> 20:24.197
You forget everything, like buying
fresh food. Listen. ABC called...

20:24.307 --> 20:27.325
Do they know who I am,
what a great star I was?

20:27.435 --> 20:30.537
- Who?
- Amanda and Sifkin.

20:31.272 --> 20:32.747
Amanda and Michael.

20:32.857 --> 20:36.042
They're 3 years old.
They don't remember vaudeville.

20:37.778 --> 20:40.839
Why is it I only get aggravated
when I come over here to see you?

20:40.948 --> 20:42.966
If you want, I'll meet you
someplace else.

20:43.075 --> 20:45.760
Is that supposed to be funny?
I don't think that's funny.

20:45.870 --> 20:48.471
If you had a sense of humor,
you'd think it was funny.

20:48.581 --> 20:52.934
- I have a terrific sense of humor!
- Like your father. He laughed once in 1932.

20:54.086 --> 20:56.521
Why couldn't you get me this commercial?

20:57.173 --> 21:00.275
You forgot you auditioned?
You kept calling it toilet paper.

21:00.384 --> 21:02.485
Will you listen to me?
Please listen to me.

21:02.595 --> 21:04.571
I heard. You got a call from NBC.

21:04.680 --> 21:06.698
- ABC!
- Same thing.

21:07.516 --> 21:10.118
ABC is doing a big television special
next month.

21:10.228 --> 21:13.913
It's an hour-and-a-half variety show
with the biggest names in show business.

21:14.023 --> 21:16.750
The theme of the show
is the history of comedy...

21:16.859 --> 21:20.420
dating from Greek theater,
through vaudeville, up to today's stars.

21:20.529 --> 21:22.589
What's the theme of the show?

21:25.785 --> 21:28.261
The theme of the show
is the history of comedy...

21:28.371 --> 21:32.057
dating from Greek theater,
through vaudeville, up to today's stars.

21:32.875 --> 21:36.394
- Why couldn't you get me on that show?
- I got you on that show.

21:37.171 --> 21:39.105
- Alone?
- $10,000.

21:39.215 --> 21:42.275
- Alone?
- Gonna be the biggest show of the year.

21:42.385 --> 21:44.110
- Alone.
- No.

21:45.554 --> 21:47.447
- With Lewis?
- Yes.

21:47.848 --> 21:51.076
- Then you ain't got me on the show.
- Will you let me finish?

21:51.185 --> 21:53.453
- You're finished. It's no.
- Can't we discuss it?

21:53.562 --> 21:55.580
- We've discussed it. I'm busy.
- Doing what?

21:55.690 --> 21:58.875
- Not discussing it.
- You could have the courtesy...

22:01.612 --> 22:03.797
You could have the courtesy
of hearing me out.

22:03.906 --> 22:06.758
ABC said to me the history of comedy
wouldn't be complete...

22:06.867 --> 22:09.928
without one of the greatest teams
to ever come out of vaudeville:

22:10.037 --> 22:12.013
Lewis and Clark, the Sunshine Boys.

22:12.123 --> 22:14.432
The vice president said this to me
in his office.

22:14.542 --> 22:15.934
The vice president said this?

22:16.043 --> 22:19.479
He's the greatest Lewis and Clark fan
in the country, since he was a kid.

22:19.588 --> 22:24.067
- He knows by heart all of your old routines.
- Then let him go on with that bastard.

22:24.760 --> 22:27.821
One shot. One night,
you do one of the old sketches.

22:27.930 --> 22:29.739
They pay $10,000 for the team.

22:29.849 --> 22:32.242
That's top money for these shows,
I promise you.

22:32.351 --> 22:34.661
I don't need any money. I live alone.

22:34.770 --> 22:38.164
I got two nice suits.
I don't have a pussycat to bother me.

22:38.274 --> 22:41.126
- I'm very happy.
- You're not happy. You're miserable.

22:41.235 --> 22:43.753
- Get me a job, I won't be so miserable.
- I've tried.

22:43.863 --> 22:46.673
Nobody's worked harder
for a client than I have.

22:46.782 --> 22:50.135
Look, you're a nice boy.
You come to visit me every Wednesday.

22:50.244 --> 22:52.262
You bring me lousy soups
which I don't eat.

22:52.371 --> 22:54.556
You're a wonderful nephew,
but you're a lousy agent.

22:54.665 --> 22:58.852
I'm a good agent, damn it! Don't say that
to me. I'm a goddamn good agent!

23:00.254 --> 23:03.064
I'm getting chest pains.
You give me chest pains.

23:03.174 --> 23:05.275
- It's my fault you get excited?
- Yes!

23:05.384 --> 23:09.362
- I only get chest pains on Wednesdays.
- So come on Tuesdays.

23:11.140 --> 23:13.324
You know what? I'm going.

23:14.268 --> 23:16.286
I don't even want
to discuss this anymore.

23:16.395 --> 23:19.456
You're impossible to talk to.
Forget the variety show.

23:19.607 --> 23:21.040
I forgot it.

23:21.859 --> 23:23.710
I'll tell you the truth, Uncle Willy.

23:23.819 --> 23:25.920
Maybe you'd be better off
with another agent.

23:26.030 --> 23:27.422
I accept your offer.

23:27.531 --> 23:30.467
Don't call me anymore, will you, please?
Not for business.

23:30.576 --> 23:32.635
Handle your own affairs, okay?

23:32.995 --> 23:36.306
- From now on, you're just my uncle.
- Take care of yourself.

23:36.999 --> 23:39.184
Say hello to Milly and Phyllis.

23:51.013 --> 23:52.363
It's still no!

23:59.438 --> 24:02.749
What's wrong? Who are you calling?

24:03.651 --> 24:05.752
Ben, it's 1:00 in the morning.

24:08.864 --> 24:11.257
- Why won't you do this for me?
- Who's that? Ben?

24:11.367 --> 24:15.553
I'm not asking you to be partners again,
but it's just for one night, one last show.

24:15.663 --> 24:19.557
Once you get an exposure like this,
Alka-Seltzer will beg me to sign you up.

24:19.667 --> 24:22.352
Jesus! How will it look
if I go to the office tomorrow...

24:22.461 --> 24:24.771
and say I couldn't make a deal
with my own uncle?

24:24.880 --> 24:26.940
My personal opinion? Lousy.

24:35.891 --> 24:38.743
Uncle Willy! Uncle Willy!

24:40.104 --> 24:41.663
Wait a minute!

24:46.819 --> 24:50.630
Willy. Willy Clark!

24:51.699 --> 24:53.800
Don't make me crazy today.

24:55.286 --> 24:58.263
Will you please stop and wait for me?

24:58.372 --> 24:59.639
For who? Who are you?

25:03.210 --> 25:05.353
Willy, will you cut it....

25:08.257 --> 25:09.482
Where are you going?

25:09.592 --> 25:12.485
You know, a new musical
went into rehearsal today...

25:12.595 --> 25:15.405
and I didn't get an audition.
Why didn't I get an audition?

25:15.514 --> 25:17.991
Because the show is all black,
and you're not black.

25:18.100 --> 25:19.867
I did black in 1928.

25:19.977 --> 25:22.537
And when I did black,
you understood the words.

25:22.646 --> 25:24.163
Not like today.

25:24.273 --> 25:27.333
I spoke to Al Lewis' daughter
on the phone. He's very interested.

25:27.443 --> 25:30.169
What does he know? He's senile.

25:30.571 --> 25:35.174
- You really hate Al Lewis that much?
- I don't discuss that person anymore.

25:35.284 --> 25:38.136
We have to discuss him.
ABC is waiting for an answer.

25:38.245 --> 25:40.722
- Ben, this is it.
- This is what?

25:40.831 --> 25:43.600
CBS. This is where we did
the Ed Sullivan Show.

25:43.709 --> 25:46.102
Six times they had us back,
not including reruns.

25:46.212 --> 25:49.272
I remember. I saw you. I was here
when you did the doctor sketch.

25:49.381 --> 25:50.732
- It was terrific.
- It wasn't.

25:50.841 --> 25:54.068
- Yes, it was.
- It wasn't terrific. It was a classic.

25:54.178 --> 25:56.404
On the nights we were lousy
it was terrific.

25:56.514 --> 25:59.157
Then why won't you work with him again
for one night?

25:59.266 --> 26:03.036
- Because of artistic differences.
- What artistic differences?

26:03.145 --> 26:06.497
I hate the son of a bitch,
that's what artistic differences.

26:07.650 --> 26:10.043
- Come on. I'll buy you lunch.
- I had lunch.

26:10.152 --> 26:12.629
Maybe you ate,
but you didn't have lunch.

26:12.947 --> 26:14.797
In here, you have lunch.

26:16.784 --> 26:18.718
Hello, Tiny. How are you?

26:18.827 --> 26:20.887
When was the last time you saw Al Lewis?

26:20.996 --> 26:23.556
Eleven years ago. I'm not discussing it.

26:23.707 --> 26:25.266
Sam.

26:27.670 --> 26:29.687
Sam, say hello to my nephew.

26:29.797 --> 26:32.231
If he was your agent,
you wouldn't be working.

26:32.341 --> 26:34.400
- Hello, nephew.
- Hello, Sam.

26:34.510 --> 26:37.487
Bring us two Sophie Tuckers
and two cream sodas.

26:38.055 --> 26:41.491
- I'm not eating anything.
- Bring it. I'll take his home in a bag.

26:41.600 --> 26:44.577
You mean to tell me you haven't
spoken to Al Lewis in 11 years?

26:44.687 --> 26:48.414
I haven't seen him in 11 years.
I haven't spoken to him in 12 years.

26:48.524 --> 26:51.417
You know they still got a sandwich here
named after me?

26:51.527 --> 26:53.586
Look at this.
The number five combination:

26:53.696 --> 26:57.507
Tongue, hot pastrami, salami,
coleslaw, Russian dressing.

26:57.616 --> 26:59.676
A Willy Clark special. That's a star.

26:59.785 --> 27:02.970
You didn't speak to him for a whole year?
What about on stage?

27:03.122 --> 27:05.682
If he played a gypsy,
I would speak to the gypsy.

27:05.791 --> 27:08.267
If he played a lunatic,
I would speak to the lunatic.

27:08.377 --> 27:10.645
But that bastard, I didn't speak to.

27:10.754 --> 27:13.356
You're not supposed to eat pickles.
It's high sodium.

27:13.465 --> 27:15.483
I'll spit out the sodium.

27:18.721 --> 27:19.946
Thank you.

27:20.055 --> 27:23.783
Just tell me what's wrong with Al Lewis.
He seemed nice enough when I met him.

27:23.892 --> 27:26.619
- Did you ever meet him?
- I just said I did.

27:27.271 --> 27:30.665
I was 13 years old.
It was backstage at some benefit.

27:30.774 --> 27:32.959
I forget the theater.
He was very sweet to me.

27:33.068 --> 27:35.545
Maybe he thought you were a midget.
He loved them...

27:35.654 --> 27:40.466
but people, he hated. Especially partners.
Just the shoes, not the socks, please.

27:40.701 --> 27:43.136
Why? What did he do
that bothered you so much?

27:43.245 --> 27:45.430
What did he do?
He used to give me the finger.

27:45.539 --> 27:47.557
- The what?
- The finger!

27:47.666 --> 27:49.809
He would poke me in the chest
with the finger.

27:49.918 --> 27:52.770
I'm telling you, Doctor.
You know what I mean, Doctor?

27:52.880 --> 27:54.772
- You hear what I'm saying, Doctor?
- Ow.

27:54.882 --> 27:58.317
That hurts, doesn't it? 43 years.
How would you like that?

27:58.427 --> 28:00.820
I had a black-and-blue hole in my chest.

28:00.929 --> 28:04.282
Till her dying day, my wife
thought it was a tattoo over there.

28:04.391 --> 28:06.993
If you work with him,
I'll buy you a padded undershirt.

28:07.102 --> 28:10.204
You think I didn't try?
Once I put a steel plate under my shirt.

28:10.314 --> 28:13.583
He gave me the finger,
he had it in a splint for a month.

28:14.902 --> 28:18.379
Willy, what if I set up a meeting
between you two, maybe lunch at Sardi's.

28:18.489 --> 28:20.673
To talk things out?
I'll be there all the time.

28:20.783 --> 28:23.509
Want to hear other things?
He used to spit in my face.

28:23.619 --> 28:27.013
- On stage, the man would spit in my face.
- Not on purpose.

28:27.122 --> 28:30.516
He tells me not on purpose.
If I could have saved the spit, I'd show you.

28:30.626 --> 28:32.643
He would stand there
and spit in your face?

28:32.753 --> 28:35.104
You think he's stupid?
He'd work it into the act.

28:35.214 --> 28:37.356
He would stand
with his nose under my nose...

28:37.466 --> 28:40.568
and he would purposely say words
only that began with a "T."

28:40.678 --> 28:43.613
Tootsie Roll. Tinkertoy.

28:44.014 --> 28:47.366
- Typing on the typewriter.
- Would you please sign in your guest, sir?

28:47.476 --> 28:50.953
He's not my guest. He's my nephew.
Some nights I thought I would drown.

28:51.063 --> 28:52.914
I don't know where he got it all from.

28:53.023 --> 28:55.875
I think he would drink all day
and save it up for the night.

28:55.984 --> 28:58.252
Don't put this near the steam.
It's corned beef.

28:58.362 --> 29:02.548
What if I put it into the contract if he pokes
you or spits at you, he doesn't get paid?

29:02.658 --> 29:05.802
He doesn't care.
He would spit at me for free.

29:06.161 --> 29:08.054
Then will you answer me one question?

29:08.163 --> 29:11.974
If it was all that bad,
why did you stick together for 43 years?

29:12.084 --> 29:13.726
- Why?
- Yes, why?

29:13.836 --> 29:17.230
Because he was terrific.
There'll never be another one like him.

29:17.339 --> 29:19.941
Nobody could time a joke
the way he could time a joke.

29:20.050 --> 29:22.235
Nobody could say a line
the way he said it.

29:22.344 --> 29:24.237
We each knew
what the other was thinking.

29:24.346 --> 29:27.573
One person, that's what we were.
No, no....

29:28.225 --> 29:31.118
Al Lewis was the best.
The best, you understand?

29:31.228 --> 29:34.288
- I understand.
- As an actor, no one could touch him.

29:34.398 --> 29:37.333
As a human being,
no one wanted to touch him.

29:37.443 --> 29:39.752
Uncle Willy, people do change.

29:40.696 --> 29:43.339
You know his wife died three years ago?

29:43.449 --> 29:46.259
He lives with his daughter now,
somewhere in New Jersey.

29:46.368 --> 29:47.927
He doesn't do anything anymore.

29:48.036 --> 29:50.930
He's got very bad arthritis,
he's got poor blood circulation.

29:51.039 --> 29:53.432
I'll send him a pump.
He'll outlive you, believe me.

29:53.542 --> 29:56.602
I spoke to his daughter.
He wants very much to do this show.

29:56.712 --> 29:58.271
With arthritis? Forget it.

29:58.380 --> 30:00.773
Instead of a finger,
he'll poke me with a cane.

30:00.883 --> 30:03.943
What if I went out to New Jersey
and spoke to him...

30:04.052 --> 30:07.113
explained how you felt,
see if we could work things out?

30:07.222 --> 30:11.492
Uncle Willy, do I have your permission
to go and speak to him?

30:11.602 --> 30:14.453
- Go speak to him.
- Thank you.

30:14.563 --> 30:18.249
But take a towel with you. I'm sorry.

30:41.548 --> 30:44.317
- Mr. Clark?
- Sorry I'm late. I got off the wrong exit.

30:44.426 --> 30:46.736
Come in. Dad just got up from his nap.

30:47.638 --> 30:48.821
He's out in the sunroom.

30:48.931 --> 30:51.032
He likes to be up
when the children get home.

30:51.141 --> 30:53.951
Mrs. Green, can I ask you a question?
How is his health?

30:54.061 --> 30:56.787
I mean, is he up to doing this show
if it all works out?

30:56.897 --> 30:59.832
I think it would be
the best thing in the world for him.

30:59.942 --> 31:02.418
And he takes very good care of himself.

31:02.528 --> 31:06.672
- He's just a little slow, that's all.
- Uh, what do you mean, slow?

31:07.199 --> 31:08.841
He doesn't like to be rushed.

31:08.951 --> 31:11.969
He lets the phone ring eight
or nine times before answering it.

31:12.079 --> 31:14.221
He'll take an hour
before he opens a letter.

31:14.331 --> 31:16.766
He was always like that.
Just the opposite of Willy.

31:16.875 --> 31:19.226
I always wondered
how they put up with each other.

31:19.336 --> 31:21.896
Dad, Mr. Clark is here.

31:23.632 --> 31:26.859
Dad, it's Mr. Clark. He's here.

31:27.261 --> 31:30.696
- What?
- It's Ben Clark, Willy's nephew.

31:31.723 --> 31:33.783
- Willy's nephew?
- Mm.

31:37.312 --> 31:40.581
How do you do, Mr. Lewis?
I'm Ben Clark, Willy's nephew.

31:40.691 --> 31:44.543
Oh, oh. Willy's nephew, Ben.
Sure. Hello, how are you?

31:44.653 --> 31:46.545
- Fine, sir.
- Good, good.

31:46.655 --> 31:49.423
You're Willy's nephew. Ben, how are you?

31:50.450 --> 31:52.259
Fine, sir. Very good.

31:52.870 --> 31:55.054
It was nice of you to see me.

31:55.163 --> 31:57.014
Really? When was that?

31:59.376 --> 32:01.519
Today.

32:01.628 --> 32:04.981
- It was nice of you to see me today.
- Certainly. Today is fine.

32:05.090 --> 32:07.650
As a matter of fact,
I was expecting you today.

32:07.759 --> 32:09.235
Please sit down, Mr. Clark.

32:09.344 --> 32:12.196
- Why doesn't he sit down?
- Thank you very much.

32:12.514 --> 32:16.283
- Can I get you anything before I go?
- No, thanks. I had lunch before I drove out.

32:16.393 --> 32:19.662
Then I'll leave you two alone.
I'll be in the kitchen if you need me.

32:19.771 --> 32:20.913
Thank you.

32:21.440 --> 32:25.167
- Can my daughter get you anything?
- No, I had lunch before I drove out.

32:25.277 --> 32:28.087
Oh? What did you have?

32:29.698 --> 32:31.966
- What did I have?
- For lunch.

32:34.620 --> 32:37.013
Chicken salad sandwich
and a cup of coffee.

32:37.122 --> 32:39.598
I had a fruit compote
and cottage cheese.

32:40.334 --> 32:41.517
Can you stay awhile?

32:41.627 --> 32:45.312
My grandchildren will be home
from school soon. Wendy and Mark.

32:45.422 --> 32:46.731
Yes, if I can.

32:46.840 --> 32:48.941
You know, we met before,
a long time ago.

32:49.051 --> 32:51.777
My father took me backstage.
I forget the theater.

32:51.887 --> 32:54.739
It must've been 15 or 20 years ago.
Do you remember that?

32:54.848 --> 32:56.615
Certainly. It was backstage.

32:56.725 --> 32:59.994
Maybe 15, 20 years ago.
I forget the theater.

33:00.562 --> 33:02.955
- That's right.
- Sure, I remember.

33:03.231 --> 33:05.541
Haven't had chicken salad in years.

33:09.988 --> 33:13.299
So, Mr. Lewis, you must be
very excited. I know I am.

33:13.408 --> 33:14.800
About what?

33:15.077 --> 33:18.304
About working again.
Doing the old act with Uncle Willy.

33:18.413 --> 33:22.641
I did it over 11,000 times.
11,001 doesn't get me excited.

33:23.168 --> 33:25.644
I can tell you ABC is very excited.

33:25.754 --> 33:28.856
We'll see. How much did you say
they were going to pay?

33:28.966 --> 33:33.110
- $10,000 for the team.
- That's $5,000 apiece, isn't it?

33:34.012 --> 33:35.654
That's what it comes to, yes.

33:35.764 --> 33:38.824
I don't have an agent anymore. He died.

33:40.227 --> 33:43.954
- I don't pay commission, you know.
- Certainly. I understand.

33:44.147 --> 33:47.083
Don't mind buying you a little gift,
but no commission.

33:47.192 --> 33:49.168
Heh. It's okay, really. Then you agree?

33:49.277 --> 33:51.962
You're willing to do the show
with Uncle Willy?

33:52.072 --> 33:56.175
- He hates my guts, you know.
- No, he never said that to me.

33:56.284 --> 33:58.636
- What?
- He never said that to me.

33:58.745 --> 34:00.888
How old are you?

34:01.790 --> 34:02.848
Why?

34:02.958 --> 34:05.434
I'd like to say something.
How old are you?

34:05.544 --> 34:06.769
I'm 33.

34:07.129 --> 34:09.772
He called me a son of a bitch bastard.

34:10.549 --> 34:14.193
- The kids aren't home yet, are they?
- I don't think so.

34:14.469 --> 34:17.196
Son of a bitch bastard,
because I retired.

34:17.304 --> 34:19.824
I just didn't
feel like doing the act anymore.

34:19.933 --> 34:22.368
- Forty-seven years is enough, isn't it?
- Certainly.

34:22.476 --> 34:24.495
- What?
- Certainly.

34:25.022 --> 34:27.706
Eleven thousand times, the same jokes.

34:28.650 --> 34:31.127
- Was I wrong for doing what I did?
- Absolutely not.

34:31.235 --> 34:32.753
- What?
- Absolutely not.

34:32.862 --> 34:34.797
So why does he say such things about me?

34:34.906 --> 34:36.340
I don't hate him.

34:36.449 --> 34:39.552
- I'm glad to hear that.
- I can't stand him, but I don't hate him.

34:39.661 --> 34:40.969
He doesn't hate you either.

34:41.079 --> 34:43.722
I guess he was just upset
about breaking up the team...

34:43.831 --> 34:46.851
after all those wonderful years.
That's understandable, isn't it?

34:46.960 --> 34:48.060
No.

34:48.670 --> 34:51.147
Anyway, I'm sure once you two
see each other again...

34:51.255 --> 34:55.192
What did you say? $5,000 apiece?
I don't pay commission, you know.

34:55.302 --> 34:56.902
- Yes.
- My agent died.

34:57.012 --> 35:00.364
- You told me.
- And they weren't such wonderful years.

35:00.474 --> 35:01.782
Someday I'll tell you.

35:01.892 --> 35:05.536
- I'd love to hear about how you and Uncle...
- Sure, I remember.

35:05.645 --> 35:10.249
It was backstage, maybe 15, 20 years ago.
I forget the theater.

35:18.617 --> 35:20.134
Why didn't you leave a message?

35:20.243 --> 35:23.679
I looked everywhere. You purposely
went out so we wouldn't have to talk.

35:23.789 --> 35:25.472
I'll be at the club, playing cards.

35:25.582 --> 35:27.641
No kidding.
Can I speak to you for a minute?

35:27.751 --> 35:29.852
Where's your manners?
Don't you say hello?

35:29.961 --> 35:32.646
This is Arthur Marx,
a great young singer...

35:32.756 --> 35:35.232
and this is Benny Friedman,
a terrific new comic.

35:35.342 --> 35:36.984
How do you do?

35:37.094 --> 35:39.653
- Now can we talk?
- Did you pick up a three of hearts?

35:39.763 --> 35:43.157
He'll do it. He's agreed to it all,
the money, dates, the doctor sketch.

35:43.266 --> 35:46.202
He agreed to come from New Jersey
to rehearse in your hotel...

35:46.311 --> 35:48.245
and he was as sweet as he can be.

35:48.355 --> 35:51.165
Now, he's waiting for me to tell him
what time to come in...

35:51.274 --> 35:54.919
and then I have to call ABC
and tell them we have a deal, okay?

35:55.028 --> 35:59.006
- Ahem. Uncle Willy, are you listening to me?
- I knock with five.

35:59.116 --> 36:00.466
ABC is waiting!

36:00.575 --> 36:02.885
What's their rush?
Are they going out of business?

36:02.994 --> 36:06.847
- I'm calling and telling Al Lewis we have...
- Wait a minute, I don't trust him!

36:06.957 --> 36:10.517
He'll rehearse with me all week
and then he'll walk out just before the show.

36:10.627 --> 36:12.811
That's what he did the last time,
the bastard.

36:12.921 --> 36:15.064
- He won't walk out.
- On the Ed Sullivan Show...

36:15.173 --> 36:17.775
he walked out on me. Retires
right in the middle of my career.

36:17.884 --> 36:19.693
A man can retire whenever he wants to.

36:19.803 --> 36:22.655
Yes, but I wasn't ready yet!
Anyway, he's sick now.

36:22.764 --> 36:25.032
You told me
he's got everything wrong with him.

36:25.142 --> 36:28.118
He's well enough
to remember his grandchildren's names.

36:28.228 --> 36:31.372
- It's ringing.
- Sixty-forty. All right, sixty-forty.

36:31.481 --> 36:33.123
I get $6,000, he gets $4,000.

36:33.233 --> 36:35.417
What the hell can he buy
in New Jersey, anyway?

36:35.527 --> 36:38.963
- It's gonna be all right. I promise you.
- Tell him I'm against it.

36:39.072 --> 36:41.757
I want him to know
I'll do the show with an "against it."

36:41.867 --> 36:44.051
He's got to be home.
I told him I would call.

36:44.161 --> 36:46.595
You know what he's doing?
He's practicing spitting.

36:46.705 --> 36:50.266
Hello, Mr. Lewis. It's Ben again.
Ben. Willy Clark's nephew.

36:50.375 --> 36:52.726
He forgot already.
He's got arthritis of the head.

36:52.836 --> 36:56.855
- It's okay, Mr. Lewis. Willy said yes.
- Yes, with an "against it."

36:56.965 --> 36:58.816
No, he's very anxious to do it.

36:58.925 --> 37:01.860
Who's anxious? Tell him I'm against it!

37:01.970 --> 37:05.030
Damn you, nephew! Lousy nephew!

37:05.140 --> 37:08.826
Monday at his hotel. How's 11:00?
What is it, a two-hour drive?

37:08.935 --> 37:11.370
Make it 9:00.

37:11.479 --> 37:16.083
No, that's the television set.
Will you shut up?

37:16.985 --> 37:19.420
All right, listen to me.

37:19.529 --> 37:23.257
If he spits or he pokes,
I'm taking him to court.

37:23.366 --> 37:27.720
You hear me? I'm taking him to court.
Listen to me...

37:28.246 --> 37:31.682
One spit or poke,
and I'm gonna take him to court!

37:32.542 --> 37:35.352
Ten to twenty years
for a spit in the face!

37:35.462 --> 37:38.897
Tell him! No toys, telephones...

37:39.424 --> 37:42.401
- ...typing on the typewriter!
- Sixth street...

37:42.510 --> 37:46.071
you go down Broadway to 74th Street,
the Ansonia Hotel.

37:47.807 --> 37:52.745
Ben. Ben Clark. Willy Clark's nephew.

37:54.064 --> 37:57.875
- My God, they're both the same!
- I'm going back to the game.

38:01.446 --> 38:05.758
- Are you nervous?
- Me? Nervous? Why should I be nervous?

38:06.493 --> 38:10.971
- What time you want me to pick you up?
- Call me, every hour on the hour.

38:34.896 --> 38:38.707
Hello, is this the Spanish kid?

38:39.067 --> 38:43.045
Willy Clark. Listen,
don't tell my nephew that I'm home.

38:43.488 --> 38:45.464
No, not....

38:46.908 --> 38:50.803
No enchilada.
Tell him I went out. I'm out.

38:50.912 --> 38:52.888
I'm not here, you understand?
I'm not here.

38:54.582 --> 38:57.351
- Wait. Who's that?
- Uncle Willy, it's Ben.

38:58.378 --> 39:00.646
He's here. Never mind, idiot.

39:01.798 --> 39:04.149
- Uncle Willy.
- Ben, is that you?

39:04.426 --> 39:05.984
Yes, open up.

39:07.262 --> 39:08.821
Wait a minute.

39:12.767 --> 39:15.702
- You're alone, or he's with you?
- I'm alone.

39:17.605 --> 39:20.749
- You sure?
- Yes, I'm sure.

39:22.193 --> 39:23.752
Wait a minute.

39:26.948 --> 39:29.800
- Slide it, don't push it.
- Wait a minute, I'll push it.

39:29.909 --> 39:32.344
Don't push it. Slide it.

39:32.579 --> 39:33.720
Slide it.

39:37.459 --> 39:41.603
- I think you're supposed to slide it.
- I rushed like crazy.

39:41.963 --> 39:43.522
I didn't want him here before me.

39:43.631 --> 39:45.691
- Did he call or anything?
- Who?

39:47.260 --> 39:49.987
You're parked too close.
It's filthy here.

39:50.096 --> 39:54.658
- Do you want me to go in with you?
- No, just wait till I get to the lobby.

39:55.226 --> 39:57.035
Probably get mugged.

40:16.873 --> 40:17.973
He's late.

40:18.083 --> 40:20.392
He's purposely coming late
to aggravate me.

40:20.502 --> 40:22.936
He's not late.
It's two minutes after 11:00.

40:23.046 --> 40:25.522
So what is he, early?
I'm telling you, he's late.

40:25.632 --> 40:28.150
I was up at 8:00 in the morning
and dressed.

40:28.259 --> 40:31.111
You call that dressed?
You're half-dressed!

40:31.721 --> 40:34.364
So for him I should get all dressed?

40:35.016 --> 40:38.911
- Why didn't you shave?
- Get me the Schick commercial, I'll shave.

40:39.020 --> 40:43.624
I think I got hepatitis.
Here, look how green I look.

40:44.692 --> 40:46.793
Wonder if I should call him.
Maybe he's sick.

40:46.903 --> 40:49.254
You believe he's sick.
But me, you don't believe.

40:49.364 --> 40:51.048
Maybe you should become his nephew.

40:51.157 --> 40:53.550
Will you stop it, Uncle Willy,
and behave yourself?

40:53.660 --> 40:57.804
What do you mean behave yourself? Who do
you think you're talking to? Susan and Jackie?

40:57.914 --> 41:00.098
Amanda and Jackie. Michael.

41:00.208 --> 41:02.518
I wish I were. I can reason with....

41:03.711 --> 41:05.103
I'm having chest pains on Monday.

41:06.423 --> 41:10.150
- That's him. You want me to get it?
- Get what? I didn't hear anything.

41:10.844 --> 41:14.279
I think it would be a nice gesture,
Uncle Willy, if you opened the door.

41:14.389 --> 41:16.615
Please. You promised me
you'd give it a chance.

41:16.724 --> 41:20.702
I'll give it every chance in the world,
but it's not going to work.

41:31.322 --> 41:33.215
- Where are you going?
- To make some tea.

41:33.324 --> 41:35.634
- I feel like some hot tea.
- Now?

41:41.124 --> 41:43.725
Ah, heh. Oh, um....

41:43.835 --> 41:48.230
- Hello, Mr. Lewis. How are you?
- Hello, how are you? I'm Al Lewis.

41:48.339 --> 41:51.984
Yeah. Yes, of course. Come on in.

41:58.766 --> 42:01.159
Uncle Willy is making some tea.

42:04.189 --> 42:05.831
Please sit down.

42:14.032 --> 42:16.216
- Thank you very much.
- Mm.

42:20.163 --> 42:23.682
Did you have any trouble
getting in from Jersey?

42:24.459 --> 42:27.728
My daughter drove me in. She has a car.

42:27.837 --> 42:29.646
Oh. That's nice.

42:29.756 --> 42:33.025
1973 Chrysler. The Imperial.

42:33.593 --> 42:36.111
- Yes, it's a wonderful car.
- Good car.

42:39.140 --> 42:41.283
Do you get into New York often?

42:41.392 --> 42:45.787
- Today is the first time in two years.
- Really? How did you find it?

42:45.897 --> 42:47.581
My daughter drove.

42:48.483 --> 42:51.627
Heh. Right. Uh....

42:54.822 --> 42:57.132
Uncle Willy, how are we doing?

42:59.661 --> 43:01.553
It's not boiling yet.

43:02.580 --> 43:06.058
- Would you care for any tea, Mr. Lewis?
- Tea would be nice, thank you.

43:06.167 --> 43:08.393
Mr. Lewis would like tea, too.

43:08.503 --> 43:11.146
- I only got one ball.
- Well, dunk twice.

43:15.176 --> 43:19.363
- May I take your coat, Mr. Lewis?
- We'll see. Maybe later.

43:29.190 --> 43:32.959
Uh, do you have any questions
you want to ask about the show...

43:33.069 --> 43:38.006
about the studio, or rehearsals,
or the airdate? Things like that?

43:38.491 --> 43:39.716
Like what?

43:41.202 --> 43:46.056
Like the studio, or the rehearsals,
or the airdate. Things like that.

43:46.457 --> 43:49.935
- Have you got the props?
- What props are those?

43:50.044 --> 43:52.938
The props for the doctor sketch.
You gotta have props.

43:53.047 --> 43:57.025
Oh. Props, certainly.
What do you need? I'll tell them.

43:57.969 --> 43:59.736
You need a desk...

44:00.263 --> 44:02.698
a telephone, a pointer...

44:02.807 --> 44:05.325
a blackboard, some white chalk...

44:05.435 --> 44:08.787
some red chalk,
a skeleton, not too tall...

44:09.147 --> 44:12.416
a stethoscope,
a thermometer, an aah-stick...

44:12.525 --> 44:16.670
- Wait a minute. What's an "ostick"?
- To put in your mouth to say "aah."

44:17.238 --> 44:19.464
- Right. An aah-stick.
- An aah-stick.

44:20.158 --> 44:23.802
A bottle of pills, big ones,
like for a horse.

44:23.911 --> 44:25.846
- About this big?
- No, that's for a pony.

44:25.955 --> 44:27.889
For a horse it's like this.

44:27.999 --> 44:32.686
- Some bandages, cotton, an eye chart...
- Wait a minute. You're going too fast.

44:33.421 --> 44:35.063
A desk.

44:35.798 --> 44:37.482
A telephone.

44:38.092 --> 44:41.069
- A pointer.
- I got all that.

44:41.804 --> 44:44.656
I mean after the cotton
and the eye chart.

44:44.849 --> 44:48.994
A man's suit, size 38.
Like the one I'm wearing.

44:49.437 --> 44:52.372
- Usually they let me keep it.
- Also in blue?

44:52.982 --> 44:55.792
Who needs two blue suits?
Get me a brown.

44:56.569 --> 44:58.420
A brown suit.

44:58.529 --> 45:01.256
- Is that all?
- That's all. And a blond.

45:02.241 --> 45:05.510
- You mean a woman?
- You know a blond nurse that's a man?

45:05.620 --> 45:09.264
Big. As big as you can find,
with a big chest.

45:09.791 --> 45:13.101
A 40, a 45. And a nice bottom.

45:13.628 --> 45:18.398
You mean a sexy girl
with a full, round rear end?

45:18.966 --> 45:22.319
Like this. This is too small,
and this is too big.

45:22.428 --> 45:25.530
- Like this is perfect.
- I know what you mean.

45:25.640 --> 45:28.033
If you bring me some pictures,
I'll pick one out.

45:28.142 --> 45:32.454
There are a million girls like that around.
11:15. I've got to go.

45:33.606 --> 45:35.540
Uncle Willy, I'm going.

45:37.402 --> 45:42.047
Mr. Lewis, I can't express to you enough
how happy I am...

45:42.156 --> 45:45.133
and speaking for the millions
of young people in this country...

45:45.243 --> 45:48.470
who never had the opportunity
of seeing Lewis and Clark work...

45:48.579 --> 45:51.723
I just want to say
thank you to both of you.

45:52.166 --> 45:54.559
To the both of you, Uncle Willy.

45:55.086 --> 45:57.896
- I just hope they won't be disappointed.
- Oh. They won't.

45:58.005 --> 46:00.398
I know they won't. I'm just saying it.

46:05.012 --> 46:07.614
- Goodbye. I'm going.
- I'll show you to the elevator.

46:07.724 --> 46:09.866
I know where it is.

46:13.104 --> 46:15.038
I'll call you tonight.

46:16.232 --> 46:19.835
I just want to say that this is
a very happy moment for me...

46:19.944 --> 46:23.505
to see you both together again,
reunited.

46:23.990 --> 46:27.884
The two kings of comedy.
I'm sure you're both very excited.

46:28.786 --> 46:34.349
Well, it looks like we're off to a great
start. I'll call you later. Goodbye.

46:44.218 --> 46:46.987
Ha-ha-ha. Have to slide it.

47:03.070 --> 47:04.963
What do you want? Tea?

47:06.365 --> 47:07.799
Yes, thanks.

47:52.453 --> 47:54.304
- Sugar?
- If you got.

47:54.539 --> 47:56.014
I got sugar.

48:21.148 --> 48:24.167
- Would you like a cracker?
- What kind of cracker?

48:24.277 --> 48:27.504
Chocolate, coconut, graham,
whatever you want.

48:28.155 --> 48:31.216
- Maybe just a plain cracker.
- I don't have any plain crackers.

48:31.325 --> 48:35.345
- I got chocolate, coconut, and graham.
- All right, a graham cracker.

48:35.454 --> 48:39.599
- They're in the kitchen in the closet.
- Maybe later.

48:46.716 --> 48:49.859
- I was sorry to hear about Lillian.
- Thank you.

48:50.219 --> 48:53.113
She was a nice woman.
I always liked Lillian.

48:53.222 --> 48:54.572
Thank you.

48:58.019 --> 49:02.080
- And how about you?
- Thank God, knock wood.

49:02.565 --> 49:03.873
Perfect.

49:04.859 --> 49:08.586
I heard different.
I heard your blood didn't circulate.

49:08.696 --> 49:11.172
Not true. My blood circulates.

49:11.282 --> 49:14.259
I'm not saying everywhere,
but it circulates.

49:14.702 --> 49:16.511
I've been lucky. I'm in the pink.

49:16.621 --> 49:19.597
I was looking. For a minute,
I thought you were having a hot flush.

49:32.386 --> 49:35.905
- Want some nuts?
- No, thanks.

49:36.057 --> 49:38.616
Not allowed to eat nuts. Too salty.

49:41.479 --> 49:44.330
- You know, Sol Burton died.
- Go on!

49:49.362 --> 49:51.046
Who's Sol Burton?

49:52.323 --> 49:54.299
You don't remember Sol Burton?

49:55.409 --> 49:58.344
Oh, yes,
the manager of the Belasco Theater.

49:58.454 --> 50:01.473
- That was Sol Bernstein.
- Not Sol Bernstein.

50:01.582 --> 50:04.059
Sol Burton was the manager
of the Belasco Theater.

50:04.168 --> 50:07.145
Sol Bernstein was the manager
of the Belasco Theater...

50:07.254 --> 50:10.899
and it wasn't the Belasco Theater,
it was the Morosco Theater.

50:11.008 --> 50:13.693
Sid Weinstein was the manager
of the Morosco.

50:13.803 --> 50:16.362
Sol Burton was the manager
of the Belasco.

50:16.472 --> 50:18.698
Sol Bernstein,
I don't know who the hell was.

50:18.808 --> 50:21.701
How can you remember anything
if your blood don't circulate?

50:21.811 --> 50:25.663
It circulates in my head.
Doesn't circulate in my feet.

50:28.109 --> 50:29.751
Anything coming down?

50:29.860 --> 50:32.712
Wait a minute. Wasn't Sid Weinstein
that lousy songwriter...

50:32.822 --> 50:35.090
who wrote Lady, lady, be my baby?

50:35.199 --> 50:38.676
No, for Christ's sake,
that's Sol Burton!

50:39.078 --> 50:42.097
That Sol Burton. He died?

50:42.456 --> 50:43.848
Last week.

50:43.958 --> 50:46.226
- Where?
- In Variety.

50:52.341 --> 50:55.527
So, this is where you live now?

50:55.845 --> 51:00.740
- Didn't I always live here?
- Not in here. You lived in the big suite.

51:02.476 --> 51:06.830
This is the big suite,
but they cut it up into five small suites.

51:06.939 --> 51:09.874
I have a beautiful room
with my daughter in New Jersey.

51:09.984 --> 51:13.795
- You live in your daughter's room?
- In her house.

51:13.904 --> 51:17.757
I have my own room, my own toilet.
They don't bother me, I don't bother them.

51:17.867 --> 51:20.510
- What is it, in the country?
- Yes, it's in the country.

51:20.619 --> 51:23.638
Where did you think New Jersey was?
In the city?

51:28.169 --> 51:32.063
So, what do you think?
Want to do the doctor sketch?

51:32.715 --> 51:35.358
Listen, it's very good money.

51:35.676 --> 51:38.820
It's only a few days' work,
and I can be back in New Jersey.

51:38.929 --> 51:42.031
If you feel you want to do it,
then I'm agreeable.

51:42.141 --> 51:45.160
- And they told you how I feel about it?
- What?

51:45.853 --> 51:48.872
I'm against it.
But if you want, I'll do it.

51:48.981 --> 51:52.709
What do you mean, you're against it?
If you're against it, don't do it.

51:52.818 --> 51:56.171
What do you care if I'm against it
as long as we're doing it?

51:56.280 --> 51:58.423
I just want you to know
why I'm doing it.

51:58.532 --> 52:00.091
Don't do me any favors.

52:00.201 --> 52:03.428
Who's doing you a favor?
I'm doing my nephew a favor.

52:03.579 --> 52:07.390
It'll be a big break for the kid
to get a couple of big stars like us.

52:07.500 --> 52:10.768
That's different. In that case,
I'm against it, too, but I'll do it.

52:10.878 --> 52:13.271
As long as we understand each other.

52:13.380 --> 52:16.774
I want to be sure you know
that I'm not doing it for the money.

52:16.884 --> 52:19.402
The money goes to my grandchildren.

52:19.595 --> 52:21.779
- The whole thing?
- The whole thing.

52:21.889 --> 52:24.073
But not now. Only if I die.

52:24.767 --> 52:27.577
If I don't die, it'll be for my old age.

52:28.229 --> 52:30.747
- The same with me.
- You haven't got grandchildren.

52:30.856 --> 52:34.959
My nephew's children.
Sidney and, uh... Mervyn.

52:36.237 --> 52:39.172
Do you want to rehearse
the sketch or not? What?

52:39.281 --> 52:42.884
- You're not against rehearsing?
- I'm against doing the show.

52:42.993 --> 52:45.678
- Rehearsing is important.
- All right, let's rehearse.

52:45.788 --> 52:49.307
Why don't we move the furniture around
and make the set?

53:47.308 --> 53:50.868
Wait a minute.
What the hell are we doing here?

53:50.978 --> 53:53.705
I'm fixing up the set.
I don't know what you're doing.

53:53.814 --> 53:55.707
- You're fixing up the set?
- That's right.

53:55.816 --> 53:58.793
You're fixing up the set
for the doctor sketch?

53:58.944 --> 54:00.670
The doctor sketch?

54:13.334 --> 54:17.729
Wait a minute, goddamn it!
We're doing the same damn thing!

54:17.838 --> 54:22.233
Are we fixing up for the doctor sketch,
or are you redecorating my apartment?

54:22.343 --> 54:25.486
I know what I'm doing.
I did this sketch for 43 years.

54:25.596 --> 54:28.906
And what was I doing all that time?
Taking a smoke?

54:29.058 --> 54:31.492
Can we please fix up
for the doctor sketch?

54:31.602 --> 54:34.537
My clothes are beginning to stink
from this apartment.

54:34.647 --> 54:38.082
All right. If you think you know
how to fix it up, you fix it up.

54:38.192 --> 54:40.126
It will be my pleasure.

54:47.451 --> 54:49.886
There. That's the doctor sketch.

54:50.246 --> 54:54.265
For how much?
That's the gypsy-chiropractor sketch.

54:54.708 --> 54:57.310
- You positive?
- I'm more than positive. I'm sure.

54:57.419 --> 55:00.521
All right, wise guy,
show me the doctor sketch.

55:09.932 --> 55:12.825
There. That's the doctor sketch.

55:16.105 --> 55:20.416
You know what you are, Willy?
You're a 73-year-old putz.

55:21.068 --> 55:24.962
Right. Only the putz didn't drive in
all the way from New Jersey.

55:25.072 --> 55:29.467
I didn't drive. My daughter did.
Now can we please rehearse the sketch?

55:29.827 --> 55:32.553
All right. Go outside.
I'm here in the doctor's office.

55:32.663 --> 55:35.807
- Want to do the part with the nurse first?
- Do you see a nurse here?

55:35.916 --> 55:38.476
How can I rehearse
with a nurse that's not here?

55:38.585 --> 55:40.603
Don't ask me. I'm a putz.

55:43.841 --> 55:45.316
Let's forget the nurse.

55:45.426 --> 55:49.404
Start with the part
where I'm in the office and you come in.

55:49.972 --> 55:54.492
All right, I'll start from where I come in.
Knock, knock. I'm looking for the doctor.

55:54.601 --> 55:56.285
First, go outside.

55:57.604 --> 56:01.749
I could be home playing solitaire now.
All right, I'm outside. Knock...

56:01.859 --> 56:05.795
Wait a minute.
You're not outside the door.

56:05.904 --> 56:08.840
- Go out the door!
- We're just rehearsing.

56:09.074 --> 56:11.759
Can't you make believe
that I'm outside the door?

56:11.869 --> 56:14.387
Sure, if you were a better actor.

56:15.831 --> 56:18.683
I'm sorry my daughter
ever bought that car.

56:19.084 --> 56:21.686
We're not going to stop
for every little thing, are we?

56:21.795 --> 56:26.315
I don't know how many years I got left.
I don't want to spend them rehearsing.

56:26.425 --> 56:29.026
We're not going to stop
for the little things.

56:29.136 --> 56:31.446
We're going to stop
for the stupid things.

56:31.555 --> 56:34.699
Not going out the door
is a stupid thing.

56:35.434 --> 56:38.494
Coming here in the first place
was the stupid thing.

56:38.604 --> 56:40.288
All right, I'm going out.

56:40.397 --> 56:44.083
If I'm outside and my daughter calls,
tell her to pick me up in 20 minutes.

56:44.193 --> 56:46.961
She can pick you up now, for all I care.

56:50.824 --> 56:54.886
- All right, give me a knock, knock, knock.
- Knock, knock, knock.

56:55.287 --> 56:58.639
Don't say it, for God's sake! Do it!

56:59.291 --> 57:03.019
- Are you ready?
- I'm ready. Give me a knock, knock, knock.

57:06.006 --> 57:07.356
Come in.

57:11.970 --> 57:15.490
- Come in, already.
- It doesn't open. It's stuck.

57:15.808 --> 57:18.409
All right, wait a minute.

57:24.942 --> 57:27.418
- Wait a minute.
- What's the matter?

57:27.653 --> 57:28.920
Wait a minute.

57:30.030 --> 57:32.089
- Is it locked?
- It's not locked.

57:33.033 --> 57:34.592
Wait a minute.

57:37.329 --> 57:41.015
It's locked.
Go downstairs and get somebody.

57:41.625 --> 57:44.560
Get the Spanish kid downstairs.
Tell him it's locked.

57:44.795 --> 57:46.604
- What did you say?
- Go down...

57:46.713 --> 57:49.607
and get somebody, for Christ's sake!

57:49.716 --> 57:51.817
Don't you understand English?

57:52.052 --> 57:54.237
Don't you yell at me.
I didn't lock the door.

57:54.346 --> 57:57.073
Certainly you locked it!
Why are you wasting time?

57:57.182 --> 57:59.200
Go down and get somebody!

58:00.519 --> 58:03.162
It's open. What's the matter with you?

58:03.814 --> 58:06.874
It's open from my side.
You locked yours.

58:06.984 --> 58:09.502
All right, come in, already. Come in.

58:11.989 --> 58:13.631
Did my daughter call?

58:13.740 --> 58:16.342
I think you went a little crazy
in the country.

58:16.452 --> 58:19.136
Do you want to insult me,
or rehearse the sketch?

58:19.246 --> 58:22.014
I would like to do both,
but we ain't got the time.

58:22.124 --> 58:24.058
All right. Forget about the door.

58:24.168 --> 58:27.144
Just stand there and say,
"Knock, knock, knock."

58:27.254 --> 58:31.607
- I hope I can get out again.
- I hope so, too. Knock, knock, knock.

58:32.009 --> 58:33.776
Knock, knock, knock.

58:34.553 --> 58:35.987
Enter!

58:37.723 --> 58:40.950
What do you mean "enter"?
What happened to "come in"?

58:41.059 --> 58:45.162
It's the same thing, enter or come in.
What's the difference as long as you're in?

58:45.272 --> 58:48.416
The difference is
we've done this sketch 11,000 times...

58:48.525 --> 58:52.169
and you always said "come in."
Suddenly today it's "enter."

58:52.279 --> 58:56.007
Why today, after all these years,
do you suddenly change it to "enter"?

58:56.116 --> 58:58.551
I'm trying to freshen up the act.

58:58.952 --> 59:01.512
Who asked you to freshen up the act?

59:01.622 --> 59:03.723
They asked for the doctor sketch,
didn't they?

59:03.832 --> 59:06.726
The doctor sketch starts with "come in"
and not "enter."

59:06.835 --> 59:10.229
You want to freshen up something?
Put some flowers in here.

59:10.339 --> 59:12.607
What's bad about "enter"
instead of "come in"?

59:12.716 --> 59:14.025
Because it's different.

59:14.134 --> 59:17.486
You know why we've been doing it
the same way for 43 years?

59:17.596 --> 59:21.198
- Because it's good.
- You know why we don't do it anymore?

59:21.308 --> 59:24.702
Because we've been doing it
for 43 years.

59:25.145 --> 59:29.040
If we're not doing it anymore,
why are we changing it?

59:29.316 --> 59:30.833
You know what's wrong with you?

59:30.943 --> 59:34.879
You've been sitting on a New Jersey porch
for too long. You're out of touch.

59:34.988 --> 59:36.380
From my window here...

59:36.490 --> 59:39.175
I see everything
that's going on in the world.

59:39.284 --> 59:41.594
Here. I see old people...

59:41.703 --> 59:44.805
I see young people,
nice people, bad people.

59:44.915 --> 59:49.393
I see holdups, I see drug addicts,
ambulances, car crashes...

59:49.503 --> 59:52.438
jumpers from buildings.
I see everything.

59:53.090 --> 59:57.693
You see a lawn mower and the milkman.

59:58.470 --> 01:00:01.197
That's why you want to say "enter"
instead of "come in"?

01:00:01.306 --> 01:00:04.408
Are you listening to me?
Are you listening to me?

01:00:04.935 --> 01:00:07.078
Why, there's someone else in the room?

01:00:07.187 --> 01:00:10.414
You don't know the first thing
that's going on today.

01:00:10.524 --> 01:00:13.709
Did you ever hear the expression
"that's where it's at"?

01:00:13.819 --> 01:00:17.421
This is where it's at,
and that's where I am!

01:00:18.323 --> 01:00:20.299
I see. Did you ever hear the expression:

01:00:20.409 --> 01:00:22.426
"You don't know
what you're talking about"?

01:00:22.536 --> 01:00:24.637
It comes in front
of the other expression:

01:00:24.746 --> 01:00:26.806
"You never knew
what you were talking about."

01:00:26.915 --> 01:00:29.684
I wasn't the one who retired.
You're the one who retired...

01:00:29.793 --> 01:00:32.269
because you were tired,
because you're old-fashioned.

01:00:32.379 --> 01:00:35.856
I'm still new-fashioned.
I'm still in demand. I'm still hot!

01:00:38.010 --> 01:00:41.112
If this room was on fire,
you wouldn't be hot.

01:00:42.764 --> 01:00:45.408
Look, I don't want to argue with you.

01:00:45.517 --> 01:00:48.786
After you say "knock, knock, knock,"
I'm gonna say "enter."

01:00:48.895 --> 01:00:52.039
If you don't like it,
you don't have to come in.

01:00:52.190 --> 01:00:55.292
If you say "enter"
after I say "knock, knock, knock"...

01:00:55.402 --> 01:00:58.129
I'm coming in, all right, but not alone.

01:00:58.238 --> 01:01:02.049
- I am bringing a lawyer with me.
- From where? From New Jersey?

01:01:02.159 --> 01:01:04.844
You're lucky if a cow comes in with you.

01:01:04.953 --> 01:01:07.888
Against you in court,
I could win with a cow.

01:01:08.915 --> 01:01:12.017
The finger.
You're starting with the finger again.

01:01:12.127 --> 01:01:14.353
With a knife? Are you crazy?

01:01:14.463 --> 01:01:17.648
Next time you give me the finger,
say goodbye to the finger!

01:01:17.758 --> 01:01:19.358
I got a terrific idea.

01:01:19.468 --> 01:01:22.611
Instead of working together again,
let's never work together again.

01:01:22.721 --> 01:01:25.865
- You're crazy.
- Crazy? I'm crazy?

01:01:25.974 --> 01:01:28.451
Keep saying it until you believe it.

01:01:33.106 --> 01:01:36.375
I may be crazy,
but you know what you are?

01:01:36.485 --> 01:01:40.212
- You're senile! You know what senile is?
- I'm not giving you any straight lines.

01:01:41.531 --> 01:01:44.383
Back! Get away!
Get away from that phone!

01:01:44.493 --> 01:01:48.596
- Lunatic.
- Hello? How are you? What?

01:01:48.705 --> 01:01:50.765
- Is that my daughter?
- Will you shut up?

01:01:50.874 --> 01:01:55.060
- Is that my daughter?
- Keep quiet! Can't you see I'm talking?

01:01:55.170 --> 01:01:57.688
Don't you see me on the phone
with a person?

01:01:57.798 --> 01:02:02.485
For God's sake, will you behave
like a human being for five seconds?

01:02:02.636 --> 01:02:06.030
For five seconds,
behave like a human being!

01:02:06.473 --> 01:02:09.742
Hello? Just a minute.
It's your daughter.

01:02:13.772 --> 01:02:16.290
Hello, sweetheart.

01:02:16.983 --> 01:02:19.668
No. No.

01:02:19.778 --> 01:02:23.589
I can't talk to you now.
I said I can't talk to you.

01:02:23.824 --> 01:02:26.383
Because he's a crazy bedbug, that's why.

01:02:26.493 --> 01:02:29.094
- I'm a bedbug?
- See what I mean?

01:02:29.204 --> 01:02:33.349
Your father is sick!
Come and get your sick father!

01:02:33.458 --> 01:02:36.227
Will you shut up?
Will you behave yourself?

01:02:36.336 --> 01:02:38.729
For God's sake, behave yourself.

01:02:40.048 --> 01:02:44.819
Doris, I want you to pick me up now.
I don't want to discuss it.

01:02:44.928 --> 01:02:49.573
Pick me up now. He pulled
a knife on me. A kitchen knife.

01:02:50.475 --> 01:02:52.952
It was still dirty from breakfast.

01:02:53.353 --> 01:02:56.664
All right. She wants to talk to you.
She's across the street.

01:02:56.773 --> 01:03:00.042
- Who is it?
- Mrs. Eleanor Roosevelt.

01:03:00.152 --> 01:03:03.295
What do you mean, who is it?
Didn't you just say it's my daughter?

01:03:03.405 --> 01:03:06.090
I know it's your daughter,
but I forgot her name.

01:03:06.199 --> 01:03:08.759
- Doris.
- What does she want?

01:03:09.035 --> 01:03:11.679
Am I Doris? She'll tell you.

01:03:12.748 --> 01:03:16.433
Hello? How are you, dear?
It's Willy Clark.

01:03:17.043 --> 01:03:20.729
Yeah. Unpleasantness?
No, there was no unpleasantness.

01:03:20.839 --> 01:03:23.607
There was stupidity,
but there was no unpleasantness.

01:03:23.717 --> 01:03:26.735
Tell her I'm getting into my coat.
Tell her I got one sleeve on.

01:03:26.845 --> 01:03:29.989
I hoped it would work out, too.
I bent over backwards and forwards.

01:03:30.098 --> 01:03:32.950
- He didn't even bend sideways.
- I got the other sleeve on.

01:03:33.059 --> 01:03:35.119
Tell her I'm up to my hat
and out the door.

01:03:35.228 --> 01:03:37.788
It's only a question of one word,
darling, "enter."

01:03:37.898 --> 01:03:41.959
- That's all it comes down to.
- The hat's on. I'm bundled up. Tell her.

01:03:42.068 --> 01:03:45.713
All right. Yes, I will. I'll tell him.
I promise I'll tell him myself.

01:03:45.822 --> 01:03:47.464
Goodbye, Dorothy.

01:03:51.369 --> 01:03:55.472
- I told her we'll give it one last chance.
- Not if you say "enter."

01:03:56.208 --> 01:03:58.767
"Come in," I stay. "Enter," I go.

01:04:00.420 --> 01:04:03.731
- Ask me knock, knock, knock.
- Don't fool around with me.

01:04:03.840 --> 01:04:07.318
I got enough pains in my neck.
Are you gonna say "come in"?

01:04:07.427 --> 01:04:11.363
- Ask me knock, knock, knock.
- I know you, you bastard.

01:04:11.932 --> 01:04:14.408
Ask me knock, knock, knock.

01:04:14.601 --> 01:04:15.910
Knock, knock, knock.

01:04:16.311 --> 01:04:20.372
- Enter!
- Bedbug. Crazy bedbug.

01:04:20.524 --> 01:04:22.166
Enter!

01:04:22.359 --> 01:04:24.752
Drop dead in the hallway,
you crazy bastard.

01:04:24.861 --> 01:04:27.171
- Enter!
- Lunatic.

01:04:27.572 --> 01:04:31.258
- Start the car.
- Are you all right?

01:04:31.368 --> 01:04:32.509
Start the car.

01:04:32.619 --> 01:04:35.471
- Dad, what happened? What's the matter?
- Just start the car.

01:04:35.580 --> 01:04:38.140
Okay, but what happened?
You're all excited.

01:04:38.250 --> 01:04:42.186
- Didn't I tell you to start the car?
- I know, but what happened?

01:04:42.462 --> 01:04:44.980
- That's what happened.
- Enter!

01:04:45.382 --> 01:04:51.654
Enter! Enter! Enter!

01:04:53.348 --> 01:04:56.075
A pointer. A stethoscope.

01:04:56.309 --> 01:05:00.663
A skeleton, not too tall.
Just get what I tell you, will you?

01:05:00.981 --> 01:05:03.707
- No turkey. I got you chicken salad.
- I had it yesterday.

01:05:03.817 --> 01:05:07.294
You're having it again today.
Lester Burns of ABC is on two.

01:05:07.404 --> 01:05:08.837
I'll call you back.

01:05:08.947 --> 01:05:11.548
Lester, how are you?

01:05:11.700 --> 01:05:15.427
Yes, this morning.
I just left them. Sensational.

01:05:15.537 --> 01:05:18.389
I watched them rehearse about
20 minutes. I was hysterical. Ha, ha.

01:05:18.498 --> 01:05:21.600
The tears were rolling down my eyes.
But I'll tell you...

01:05:21.710 --> 01:05:24.687
what was even more important,
it was so touching.

01:05:24.796 --> 01:05:27.773
I mean, these men still love each other
after all these years.

01:05:27.883 --> 01:05:29.566
I wish you could have seen...

01:05:29.676 --> 01:05:31.944
Your uncle on three.
Sounds like trouble.

01:05:32.053 --> 01:05:36.490
Les, could you hold it one second?
What is it, Willy?

01:05:38.018 --> 01:05:40.786
Never mind. Just tell me what happened.

01:05:41.730 --> 01:05:42.830
Yeah?

01:05:43.773 --> 01:05:45.082
And then?

01:05:45.609 --> 01:05:47.459
And then?

01:05:47.569 --> 01:05:51.588
And what? Oh, shit!
Hold it, Uncle Willy.

01:05:52.824 --> 01:05:55.759
Les, could I call you right back?

01:05:56.745 --> 01:06:00.431
Uncle Willy, didn't you promise....
Don't you hang up on me!

01:06:19.601 --> 01:06:22.453
I told you on the phone
it was pointless to drive out here.

01:06:22.562 --> 01:06:25.289
- My father won't discuss it.
- Can I come in for a minute?

01:06:25.398 --> 01:06:27.416
Dad is sleeping.
I don't want to wake him.

01:06:27.525 --> 01:06:29.668
What if they didn't have to
rehearse anymore?

01:06:29.778 --> 01:06:32.546
Your dad just has to come in
to the studio for a technical.

01:06:32.656 --> 01:06:36.050
- They don't have to speak to each other.
- I have to do what he asks me.

01:06:36.159 --> 01:06:40.054
He is my father. Maybe if you
call back tonight. I'm sorry.

01:06:40.163 --> 01:06:43.682
I can't wait. ABC needs a signed contract
on their desk by 5:00.

01:06:43.792 --> 01:06:47.019
- Let me in.
- Mr. Clark, vaudeville is dead.

01:06:47.295 --> 01:06:49.396
Thank God my father isn't.

01:07:04.688 --> 01:07:08.499
Hello, Mr. Lewis.
Can I please speak to you for a minute?

01:07:08.608 --> 01:07:12.002
- What?
- Can I speak to you for a minute?

01:07:12.862 --> 01:07:14.004
What?

01:07:20.453 --> 01:07:22.554
What the hell is he saying?

01:07:47.313 --> 01:07:50.833
- Thank you, Mr. Lewis. Can you hear me?
- No.

01:07:50.942 --> 01:07:53.418
Could you open the window?
I'm down on my knees here.

01:07:53.528 --> 01:07:56.171
- It's freezing in here.
- Out here, too.

01:07:56.281 --> 01:07:58.715
Could I come in?
I'll only stay a minute, I swear.

01:07:58.825 --> 01:08:01.135
Not if it's about the show.
Don't lie to me.

01:08:01.244 --> 01:08:02.928
- It's about the show.
- Freeze.

01:08:03.038 --> 01:08:04.179
Wait.

01:08:05.165 --> 01:08:08.725
He won't say "enter." He'll say "come in."
He promised me.

01:08:08.835 --> 01:08:10.018
- You believe him?
- Yes.

01:08:10.128 --> 01:08:13.730
- Then you're a bigger putz than I am.
- Wait! No!

01:08:14.424 --> 01:08:16.649
N... Wait! No more rehearsals.

01:08:16.760 --> 01:08:18.569
Just one technical
the day before the show.

01:08:18.678 --> 01:08:22.613
You don't even have to talk to him.
I'll be there every minute.

01:08:23.390 --> 01:08:25.325
I'm gonna finish my nap now.

01:08:26.394 --> 01:08:31.081
Mr. Lewis, do you realize
what a thrill it would be...

01:08:31.191 --> 01:08:34.626
for Mark and Wendy to see
their grandfather on television...

01:08:34.736 --> 01:08:38.337
on the same show
with Bob Hope and Phyllis Diller?

01:08:38.448 --> 01:08:42.176
Wow. They'd be the proudest kids
in the whole neighborhood.

01:08:42.285 --> 01:08:45.761
Not for me.
Not for Willy or for yourself.

01:08:45.997 --> 01:08:48.599
Do it for Mark and Wendy, Mr. Lewis.

01:08:53.671 --> 01:08:56.607
- And I don't have to talk to that lunatic?
- Not even hello.

01:08:56.716 --> 01:08:59.484
Dad.... What are you doing?

01:08:59.719 --> 01:09:02.196
I thought you weren't even
going to discuss it again.

01:09:02.305 --> 01:09:04.156
It's only open a half inch.

01:09:07.769 --> 01:09:09.620
Just a half inch, Mrs. Green.

01:09:32.210 --> 01:09:33.935
Thank you. Thank you very much.

01:09:34.045 --> 01:09:37.314
I'm so delighted you had the nerve
to fall into this joint.

01:09:37.423 --> 01:09:38.774
Hold it a second, folks.

01:09:39.008 --> 01:09:40.984
Phyllis, you're off your mark again.

01:09:41.094 --> 01:09:43.862
I can't pick you up for close-up
if you get off your mark.

01:09:43.971 --> 01:09:47.491
Come on, nobody's tuning in
to see how you're marking it.

01:09:47.600 --> 01:09:52.037
They're tuning in to see how I'm doing it,
and this is the way I'm doing it, baby.

01:09:52.147 --> 01:09:53.663
- Comics.
- We're running behind...

01:09:53.773 --> 01:09:55.624
if you want to get to Lewis and Clark.

01:09:55.733 --> 01:09:59.628
After what I went through
with them yesterday? Let's run behind.

01:10:00.280 --> 01:10:03.298
Phyllis, whenever you're ready.
From the top of your monologue.

01:10:03.575 --> 01:10:06.718
Okay. Thank you very much,
ladies and gentlemen.

01:10:06.828 --> 01:10:09.846
So delighted you had the nerve
to fall into this joint. Ha, ha.

01:10:09.956 --> 01:10:12.015
You think I'm overdressed?
This is my slip.

01:10:12.125 --> 01:10:14.351
I hope they have
separate dressing rooms.

01:10:14.460 --> 01:10:16.812
I don't have room
for half the people I have now.

01:10:16.921 --> 01:10:19.898
I've got 67 performers in this show.
They're one act, aren't they?

01:10:20.008 --> 01:10:21.942
- They get one room.
- I know it's one act...

01:10:22.051 --> 01:10:24.278
but it's two people
who don't talk to each other.

01:10:24.387 --> 01:10:26.530
- Who doesn't talk to each other?
- Lewis and Clark.

01:10:26.639 --> 01:10:30.033
- They don't talk to each other?
- Onstage they talk. Offstage they don't.

01:10:30.143 --> 01:10:35.539
- Let them get dressed on stage.
- Oh, boy. Oh, boy, oh, boy.

01:10:35.648 --> 01:10:37.207
My God!

01:10:37.317 --> 01:10:38.917
Isn't that enough of a rehearsal?

01:10:39.027 --> 01:10:42.546
I don't make any more moves.
I don't want to blow the jokes, you know?

01:10:45.033 --> 01:10:49.261
- Thanks.
- Hello there. Hiya, boys. How's it going?

01:10:50.538 --> 01:10:52.222
Hello. How are you?

01:10:52.332 --> 01:10:54.391
Hello, girls. Hello there.

01:10:54.876 --> 01:10:56.977
- Hi. Hello there.
- Hi.

01:10:57.420 --> 01:10:59.771
- Willy!
- You got a nice smile.

01:10:59.881 --> 01:11:02.733
You've got 10 minutes to put on
your makeup and get dressed.

01:11:02.842 --> 01:11:07.571
- I never missed an entrance in 57 years.
- Please hurry, Uncle Willy.

01:11:07.722 --> 01:11:09.823
- They're running behind.
- Is he in there?

01:11:09.933 --> 01:11:13.201
- I couldn't get separate rooms.
- When he's through, I'll get dressed.

01:11:13.311 --> 01:11:16.997
Now, Willy.
You've got 10 minutes to be on stage.

01:11:18.691 --> 01:11:21.168
I hope you can put on your makeup
and get dressed...

01:11:21.277 --> 01:11:22.919
in what is now nine minutes.

01:11:23.029 --> 01:11:26.089
- All right.
- Dressing room six. Second on the right.

01:11:26.866 --> 01:11:29.343
- You're not coming?
- I've got to go check the props.

01:11:29.452 --> 01:11:32.554
No one knows what an aah-stick is.
Go on.

01:11:32.664 --> 01:11:34.056
What number?

01:11:35.124 --> 01:11:37.225
- Six.
- Number six.

01:11:57.146 --> 01:11:59.122
Hit the lights!

01:13:48.841 --> 01:13:51.818
Eddie, where are you?

01:13:54.263 --> 01:13:58.492
- Yeah, right here.
- Any chance of doing this today?

01:13:58.601 --> 01:14:01.077
We're ready. We're just waiting
for Lewis and Clark.

01:14:01.187 --> 01:14:04.414
- Why don't you call them?
- They're locked in their dressing room.

01:14:04.524 --> 01:14:06.333
- What?
- They can't get the door open.

01:14:06.442 --> 01:14:09.628
It's locked from the inside,
but they're working on it.

01:14:09.737 --> 01:14:11.630
All right, let's clear the stage.

01:14:11.739 --> 01:14:14.591
Get the props.
I want the pliers where they belong.

01:14:14.909 --> 01:14:18.512
Don't force it, Willy.
Just turn the lock to the right.

01:14:18.621 --> 01:14:22.057
- Wait a minute.
- To the right, idiot.

01:14:22.166 --> 01:14:24.935
The man doesn't know his left
from his right.

01:14:25.211 --> 01:14:27.729
Get back away from the door, Willy.

01:14:28.297 --> 01:14:30.357
- We're using dynamite.
- What?

01:14:30.466 --> 01:14:34.027
- Get away from the door.
- Are you kidding with the dynamite?

01:14:36.764 --> 01:14:39.783
$800,000 for a show,
and they can't get a door open.

01:14:39.892 --> 01:14:42.994
They're out, Mr. Schaeffer.
We're ready to go any time you are.

01:14:43.104 --> 01:14:45.455
- We're awfully sorry.
- Who the hell is that?

01:14:45.565 --> 01:14:49.626
I'm the nephew. The agent.
The agent-nephew.

01:14:49.735 --> 01:14:51.461
Ready to go, Mr. Schaeffer.

01:14:51.571 --> 01:14:54.422
Look, I've got 12 more numbers
to get through today.

01:14:54.532 --> 01:14:57.425
Tell them to run straight through,
no stopping.

01:14:57.535 --> 01:14:59.886
We'll clean up all the mistakes
after run-through.

01:14:59.996 --> 01:15:04.307
- Got you. Thank you, Mr. Schaeffer.
- Thank you. Eddie, is Steve ready?

01:15:04.667 --> 01:15:07.102
- Roll the film.
- Roll.

01:15:07.962 --> 01:15:11.106
Please, almighty TV God,
let me get through this today.

01:15:11.215 --> 01:15:14.484
- four, three, two, one.
- Cue, Steve.

01:15:15.303 --> 01:15:17.821
The golden age of comedy
reached its zenith...

01:15:17.930 --> 01:15:21.032
during a fabulous and glorious era
known as vaudeville.

01:15:21.142 --> 01:15:25.579
Fanny Brice, W.C. Fields, Eddie Cantor,
Ed Wynn, Will Rogers...

01:15:25.688 --> 01:15:28.081
and a host of other greats
fill its hall of fame.

01:15:28.191 --> 01:15:30.667
There are two other names
that belong on this list...

01:15:30.776 --> 01:15:33.211
but they can never be listed separately.

01:15:33.404 --> 01:15:37.382
They're more than a team. They're two
comic shining lights that beam as one.

01:15:37.492 --> 01:15:41.011
For Lewis without Clark,
would be like laughter without joy.

01:15:41.120 --> 01:15:42.887
We're privileged to present tonight...

01:15:42.997 --> 01:15:45.599
in their first public performance
in over 11 years...

01:15:45.708 --> 01:15:48.059
for half a century
known as the Sunshine Boys...

01:15:48.169 --> 01:15:49.853
Mr. Al Lewis and Mr. Willy Clark...

01:15:49.962 --> 01:15:53.064
in their beloved scene
"The Doctor Will See You Now."

01:15:57.470 --> 01:15:59.738
- Open wide and say "aah."
- Aah!

01:15:59.889 --> 01:16:02.490
- Wider.
- Aah!

01:16:02.642 --> 01:16:04.034
Your throat is all right...

01:16:04.143 --> 01:16:06.536
but you're gonna have trouble
with your stomach.

01:16:06.646 --> 01:16:08.830
- How come?
- You just swallowed the stick.

01:16:08.940 --> 01:16:11.499
- That's terrible. What could I get?
- Termites.

01:16:11.609 --> 01:16:14.210
Oh, my God! Take out the stick.

01:16:14.320 --> 01:16:17.756
Come back tomorrow.
On Thursdays I do woodwork.

01:16:20.201 --> 01:16:24.721
- Nurse.
- Did you want me, Doctor?

01:16:24.830 --> 01:16:27.766
Yeah, but we got business first.
What's your name again?

01:16:27.875 --> 01:16:30.894
Miss McIntosh.
You know, like the apples.

01:16:31.003 --> 01:16:33.438
I forgot the name,
but the apples I remember.

01:16:33.548 --> 01:16:35.940
Look in my appointment book
and see who's next.

01:16:36.050 --> 01:16:39.611
- It's a Mr. Kornheiser.
- Maybe you're wrong. Look in the book.

01:16:39.720 --> 01:16:44.157
- It's better that way.
- Nope. I was right.

01:16:44.308 --> 01:16:45.867
So was I.

01:16:46.435 --> 01:16:49.287
Please, Doctor,
you're standing too close.

01:16:49.397 --> 01:16:52.082
With you, it's not possible.
How much do I pay you?

01:16:52.191 --> 01:16:55.960
- $85 a week.
- If I pay you $90, will you give me a kiss?

01:16:56.070 --> 01:16:58.546
- Yes, Doctor.
- Good. Make it $150...

01:16:58.656 --> 01:17:01.383
- ...and we'll settle tonight.
- Thank you, Doctor.

01:17:03.327 --> 01:17:06.763
Excuse me. I think I have a chest cold.

01:17:06.872 --> 01:17:10.558
- Looks more like an epidemic to me.
- Yes, Doctor.

01:17:10.918 --> 01:17:13.269
Is there anything else you can think of?

01:17:13.379 --> 01:17:16.231
I can think of it,
but I'm not so sure I can do it.

01:17:16.340 --> 01:17:20.902
If I can help you, Doctor,
that's what the nurse is for.

01:17:23.848 --> 01:17:27.200
Boy, am I glad
I didn't go to law school.

01:17:28.936 --> 01:17:34.416
Aha! I hear knock, knock, knock.
That must be the next patient. Come in.

01:17:35.401 --> 01:17:37.669
And enter!

01:17:41.324 --> 01:17:43.133
Ugh. Jesus.

01:17:43.284 --> 01:17:45.343
- I'm looking for the doctor.
- Are you sick?

01:17:45.453 --> 01:17:46.761
- Are you the doctor?
- Yes.

01:17:46.871 --> 01:17:48.680
- Then I'm gonna be sick.
- Sit down.

01:17:48.789 --> 01:17:51.808
- For my records, what's your name?
- Kornheiser.

01:17:51.917 --> 01:17:53.935
- And your first name?
- Sylvia.

01:17:54.045 --> 01:17:55.812
Sylvia Kornheiser?

01:17:55.921 --> 01:17:59.482
- Isn't that a funny name for a man?
- That's what my wife Herman says.

01:17:59.592 --> 01:18:02.485
I see. The first thing
I'm gonna have to do is examine you.

01:18:02.595 --> 01:18:04.446
- Take off your clothes.
- Nothing doing.

01:18:04.555 --> 01:18:07.282
- You won't take them off?
- Not with a name like Sylvia.

01:18:07.391 --> 01:18:08.867
Then how will I examine you?

01:18:09.101 --> 01:18:11.494
That's what I came for.
I came to examine you.

01:18:11.604 --> 01:18:14.998
- You got everything backwards.
- It's possible. I dressed in a hurry.

01:18:15.107 --> 01:18:18.626
I'm here to examine you! I'm the doctor!

01:18:18.736 --> 01:18:21.296
And I'm here to examine you.
I'm the tax collector.

01:18:21.405 --> 01:18:24.382
- I'll be a monkey's uncle.
- We'll discuss your dependents later.

01:18:24.492 --> 01:18:28.011
I'm a busy man. If you want to see me,
make an appointment with my nurse.

01:18:28.120 --> 01:18:30.305
I did. I'm seeing her
Friday night for dinner.

01:18:30.414 --> 01:18:33.683
Don't fool around with my nurse!
Don't fool around with my nurse!

01:18:33.793 --> 01:18:37.395
She's a nice girl. She's a Virginian.

01:18:38.297 --> 01:18:40.774
- A what?
- A Virginian.

01:18:40.883 --> 01:18:44.319
- That's where she's from.
- She ain't going back, I'll tell you that.

01:18:44.428 --> 01:18:45.820
I got some questions to ask.

01:18:45.930 --> 01:18:48.865
- To see me, you got to be a patient.
- But I'm not sick.

01:18:48.974 --> 01:18:50.784
Don't worry. We'll find something.

01:18:50.893 --> 01:18:53.203
All right, you examine me,
and I'll examine you.

01:18:53.312 --> 01:18:55.497
First question:
How much money did you make last year?

01:18:55.606 --> 01:18:57.707
Last year, I made....

01:18:59.777 --> 01:19:01.920
- I didn't hear that.
- Aah! Hard of hearing.

01:19:02.029 --> 01:19:03.505
I knew we'd find something.

01:19:03.614 --> 01:19:06.966
My turn.
Now, is your father living or deceased?

01:19:07.076 --> 01:19:08.343
- Both.
- What do you mean?

01:19:08.452 --> 01:19:11.262
- First he was living, now he's deceased.
- What did he die of?

01:19:11.372 --> 01:19:13.556
My mother. What are you doing?

01:19:13.666 --> 01:19:17.435
- I'm examining your lower intestine.
- Then why do you look in the ear?

01:19:17.545 --> 01:19:21.105
If I got a choice of two places to look,
I'll take this one.

01:19:21.632 --> 01:19:24.025
- Roll up your sleeve.
- What are you gonna do?

01:19:24.135 --> 01:19:26.736
- I need a sample of your blood.
- I don't have that many.

01:19:26.846 --> 01:19:29.072
Give me what you can.
The rest, you can owe me.

01:19:29.181 --> 01:19:31.908
Sit down, Sylvia, and cross your legs.

01:19:33.936 --> 01:19:36.412
Tell me, does it hurt
when you get hit with a hammer?

01:19:36.522 --> 01:19:39.499
- Certainly.
- Good. Try not to get hit with a hammer.

01:19:39.608 --> 01:19:41.751
- You see this bottle?
- Yes.

01:19:41.861 --> 01:19:43.711
You know what you're supposed to do?

01:19:43.821 --> 01:19:45.922
- I think so.
- You think so or you know so?

01:19:46.031 --> 01:19:49.592
If you're not sure, let me know.
The girl doesn't come in to clean today.

01:19:49.744 --> 01:19:52.971
- What do you want me to do?
- I want you to go in this bottle.

01:19:53.080 --> 01:19:56.432
- I got to go over your books.
- The hell you will.

01:19:56.542 --> 01:19:59.644
If I don't go over them, the government
will come and go over them.

01:19:59.754 --> 01:20:03.439
- Don't they have a place in Washington?
- They got to go where the books are.

01:20:03.549 --> 01:20:06.234
- The whole government?
- No, just the Treasury Department.

01:20:06.343 --> 01:20:08.611
Dr. Kluckenmier.

01:20:09.013 --> 01:20:12.657
I told you not to bust in here.

01:20:12.767 --> 01:20:15.869
I'm sorry. Mrs. Kugelman
is on the phone.

01:20:15.978 --> 01:20:19.122
She wants you to rush right over
and deliver her baby.

01:20:19.231 --> 01:20:22.458
I'm busy now.
I'll mail it to her in the morning.

01:20:22.651 --> 01:20:24.127
Yes, Doctor.

01:20:28.282 --> 01:20:30.550
Where did you find
a couple of nurses like that?

01:20:30.659 --> 01:20:33.595
She was standing on 43rd
and 44th Street.

01:20:33.704 --> 01:20:36.431
Sit down. I want to examine your tongue.

01:20:37.708 --> 01:20:41.811
- Aah! You got a white coat on there.
- Did you expect a gray sports jacket?

01:20:42.087 --> 01:20:43.187
- Say "aah."
- Aah!

01:20:43.297 --> 01:20:44.772
Just as I thought.

01:20:44.882 --> 01:20:48.067
You got a rotten appendix.
I'm gonna have to take out your tonsils.

01:20:48.177 --> 01:20:51.195
- Why my tonsils?
- From here, I can't reach your appendix.

01:20:51.305 --> 01:20:54.490
Never mind my tonsils.
What about your taxes?

01:20:55.434 --> 01:20:57.327
- My what?
- Your taxes.

01:20:57.728 --> 01:21:00.663
It's time to pay your taxes
to the Treasury.

01:21:01.607 --> 01:21:04.167
I'm warning you, cut that out.

01:21:04.819 --> 01:21:06.169
What are you talking about?

01:21:06.278 --> 01:21:10.048
You know what I'm talking about.
Time to pay the taxes to the Treasury.

01:21:10.157 --> 01:21:12.175
You're speaking with the spitting again.

01:21:12.284 --> 01:21:15.938
I read the right line, didn't I?
I can't help it if it comes out juicy.

01:21:16.038 --> 01:21:19.182
Stop squeezing the juice,
it won't come out that way.

01:21:19.625 --> 01:21:22.685
Where? Where does it say that?
I haven't got that.

01:21:23.087 --> 01:21:25.688
Mr. Clark, I don't have
those last lines in my script.

01:21:25.798 --> 01:21:28.358
It's not in the script.
It's in his mouth.

01:21:28.467 --> 01:21:31.027
He stopped. I didn't stop.
He's the one who stopped.

01:21:31.136 --> 01:21:34.489
I stopped because he spit.
He's purposely spitting on the "T's."

01:21:34.598 --> 01:21:37.116
I didn't spit on purpose.
I spit on accident.

01:21:37.226 --> 01:21:40.078
It's not possible
to say "T's" without spitting a little.

01:21:40.187 --> 01:21:42.747
Then don't say "T's"!
Say "L's" or "W's"!

01:21:42.857 --> 01:21:45.667
But there's no "L's" or "W's" in taxes.

01:21:45.776 --> 01:21:47.460
He did it again. Did you see that?

01:21:47.570 --> 01:21:50.129
He sneaked an extra one in.
Did you see it?

01:21:51.991 --> 01:21:55.218
Uh, Uncle Willy, Mr. Lewis,
why don't we finish the rehearsal...

01:21:55.327 --> 01:21:56.469
and discuss this later?

01:21:56.579 --> 01:21:59.889
Do you mind? I'll direct this show.

01:21:59.999 --> 01:22:02.684
Why don't we finish the rehearsal
and discuss this later?

01:22:02.793 --> 01:22:03.893
It's all right with me.

01:22:04.003 --> 01:22:08.064
I'm not gonna stand here
and get a shower in my face.

01:22:08.173 --> 01:22:11.693
Either he says a softer "T"
or I do the show with an umbrella.

01:22:11.802 --> 01:22:14.904
Argh. I'm not getting
enough money for this.

01:22:15.222 --> 01:22:17.573
Gentlemen, with all due respect,
we have to go on.

01:22:17.683 --> 01:22:19.325
I have 12 more scenes to rehearse.

01:22:19.435 --> 01:22:21.619
I cannot spend any time
on personal squabbles.

01:22:21.729 --> 01:22:23.204
Can we please go on?

01:22:23.522 --> 01:22:25.289
Say something to him.

01:22:26.775 --> 01:22:28.626
Can we please go on?

01:22:31.071 --> 01:22:34.090
All right, I'll go on,
but I'm moving to a safer spot.

01:22:34.199 --> 01:22:35.383
Just a second. You have to...

01:22:35.492 --> 01:22:37.802
Why don't we skip a couple of lines?

01:22:37.912 --> 01:22:40.346
Let's... Let's pick it up on:

01:22:40.456 --> 01:22:42.432
"I hope you don't have
what Mr. Melnick had."

01:22:42.541 --> 01:22:44.892
- What?
- "I hope you don't have what Mr. Melnick has."

01:22:45.002 --> 01:22:47.020
Melnick. All right.

01:22:47.212 --> 01:22:50.857
- Here. You want to pick it up on Melnick?
- Melnick, right.

01:22:53.135 --> 01:22:56.029
All right, Mr. Clark,
whenever you're ready.

01:22:57.598 --> 01:23:00.283
I hope you don't have
what Mr. Melnick had.

01:23:00.392 --> 01:23:01.701
What did Mr. Melnick have?

01:23:01.810 --> 01:23:03.870
Ask him yourself.
He's standing right here.

01:23:03.979 --> 01:23:05.079
That's Mr. Melnick?

01:23:05.189 --> 01:23:08.291
It could be Mrs. Melnick.
Without high heels, I can't tell.

01:23:08.400 --> 01:23:10.793
If he's dead,
why do you leave him standing here?

01:23:10.903 --> 01:23:13.171
He's still got
one more appointment with me.

01:23:13.280 --> 01:23:16.424
You know what you are? You're a quack.
A quack.

01:23:16.533 --> 01:23:19.052
Do you know what a quack is?

01:23:19.495 --> 01:23:22.013
A quack is a bastard
who pokes me with his finger.

01:23:22.122 --> 01:23:23.431
He's doing it on purpose!

01:23:23.540 --> 01:23:26.976
First the spitting, then the poking.
I know his routine already!

01:23:27.586 --> 01:23:29.854
Where? Where does it say that?

01:23:29.964 --> 01:23:31.481
Who's got that in their script?

01:23:31.590 --> 01:23:35.902
I didn't poke him. A little tap.
A little tiny tap that wouldn't hurt a baby.

01:23:36.011 --> 01:23:37.320
Maybe a baby elephant.

01:23:37.429 --> 01:23:40.281
I'm not even dry in the face,
he's starting with the finger!

01:23:40.391 --> 01:23:41.532
I better get down there.

01:23:41.642 --> 01:23:44.202
Excuse me. I'm sorry
we're holding up the rehearsal...

01:23:44.311 --> 01:23:48.164
but we have a serious problem on our hands.
The man I'm working with is a lunatic.

01:23:48.273 --> 01:23:50.500
I'm a lunatic?

01:23:50.609 --> 01:23:54.170
I'm a lunatic?
I'm gonna tell you something now...

01:23:54.279 --> 01:23:57.507
I never told you
before in my entire life:

01:23:57.616 --> 01:23:59.967
I hate your guts!

01:24:00.077 --> 01:24:02.512
- We're holding up...
- You told it to me on Monday.

01:24:02.621 --> 01:24:04.972
Remember it if I don't see you
next Monday.

01:24:05.082 --> 01:24:08.101
- We're holding up the rehearsal.
- What's the point of going on?

01:24:08.210 --> 01:24:11.062
Everything I do is wrong.
He's persecuting me.

01:24:11.171 --> 01:24:13.648
For 11 years,
he's been waiting to get back at me...

01:24:13.757 --> 01:24:16.692
- ...only I'm not gonna give him the chance.
- I knew it.

01:24:16.802 --> 01:24:20.404
He's purposely doing it.
He set me up for 11 years...

01:24:20.514 --> 01:24:22.448
just to walk out on me!

01:24:22.558 --> 01:24:26.911
- I didn't want to do it in the first place.
- Liar! Liar!

01:24:27.021 --> 01:24:29.872
- His daughter begged me on the phone!
- We need the stage!

01:24:29.982 --> 01:24:32.500
We need the stage.
Please just take him outside.

01:24:32.609 --> 01:24:34.377
Will you go outside and do this?

01:24:34.486 --> 01:24:36.504
You can do it in Canada, for all I care.

01:24:36.613 --> 01:24:38.798
The man is a lunatic.
Get him a glass of water.

01:24:38.907 --> 01:24:41.175
Who wants to work with that has-been?

01:24:41.326 --> 01:24:42.802
I don't need you!

01:24:42.911 --> 01:24:46.222
I didn't need you then,
and I don't need you today!

01:24:46.331 --> 01:24:50.309
You were nothing when I found you,
and you're nothing today!

01:24:50.419 --> 01:24:53.563
Maybe his career is over, but not mine.

01:24:53.672 --> 01:24:56.566
Maybe he's finished, but not me!

01:24:56.675 --> 01:24:58.693
Do you hear? Not me!

01:25:01.930 --> 01:25:04.073
- Uncle Willy.
- Aah!

01:25:10.355 --> 01:25:13.374
All right, Willy, take it easy.
Don't move.

01:25:13.650 --> 01:25:15.209
Get a doctor, quick.

01:25:15.319 --> 01:25:17.879
I don't want a doctor.

01:25:19.323 --> 01:25:22.091
I don't need a doctor.
I don't trust them.

01:25:24.703 --> 01:25:28.264
Don't talk. You'll be all right.
Somebody get a blanket, please.

01:25:30.709 --> 01:25:33.269
Come on, give the guy some room,
would you, please?

01:25:33.378 --> 01:25:35.438
Don't tell Al.

01:25:37.382 --> 01:25:40.902
Don't tell Al that I fell down, Ben.

01:25:41.386 --> 01:25:43.571
I don't want to give him...

01:25:43.847 --> 01:25:45.489
the satisfaction.

01:25:45.599 --> 01:25:49.285
There's nothing to tell.
You'll be all right. You're gonna be fine.

01:25:51.522 --> 01:25:53.164
- Frumpies.
- What?

01:25:54.399 --> 01:25:58.920
That's the name of the potato chips.

01:25:59.613 --> 01:26:00.963
Frumpies.

01:26:01.448 --> 01:26:03.299
I remember it, Ben.

01:26:03.575 --> 01:26:07.470
You see, I told you I'd remember it.

01:26:08.413 --> 01:26:10.473
Frumpies.

01:26:19.633 --> 01:26:21.317
I knew Monday.

01:26:21.426 --> 01:26:24.362
I saw it coming.
I should have stopped it on Monday.

01:26:24.972 --> 01:26:26.405
How is he?

01:26:29.143 --> 01:26:32.328
They're not sure yet,
but they don't think it's too bad.

01:26:32.521 --> 01:26:34.705
I know him. He's strong.

01:26:35.023 --> 01:26:38.376
Anyone who can get in front
of an audience for 57 years...

01:26:38.485 --> 01:26:40.002
has to be strong.

01:26:40.154 --> 01:26:42.672
It's nice of you to come.
I appreciate it.

01:26:42.781 --> 01:26:44.757
Don't tell him I was here.

01:26:44.908 --> 01:26:47.343
I don't want to upset him any more.

01:26:47.661 --> 01:26:49.011
I understand.

01:26:50.455 --> 01:26:52.807
- Mr. Clark?
- Oh. Excuse me.

01:26:52.916 --> 01:26:55.226
Mr. Lewis, I'm Ben's wife, Helen.

01:26:55.335 --> 01:26:58.396
- What?
- This is Ben's wife, Helen.

01:26:58.505 --> 01:27:00.439
- How do you do? I'm Doris.
- Hello.

01:27:00.549 --> 01:27:03.276
- This is my daughter, Doris.
- Yes, I know.

01:27:05.929 --> 01:27:07.238
He's okay.

01:27:07.598 --> 01:27:10.116
- They don't think he's in any danger.
- But he's okay?

01:27:10.225 --> 01:27:13.369
They figure a couple of weeks
in the hospital. They'll have to see.

01:27:13.478 --> 01:27:14.829
- But he's okay?
- Yes.

01:27:14.938 --> 01:27:19.041
They'll keep him in intensive care
until tomorrow just as a precaution.

01:27:19.151 --> 01:27:22.044
He can't have visitors
so there's no point in hanging around.

01:27:22.154 --> 01:27:26.465
- But they said he's all right?
- Ben's just told you. He's all right.

01:27:27.451 --> 01:27:30.094
I know it's been a long day
for you, too, Mr. Lewis.

01:27:30.204 --> 01:27:33.639
Why don't you go home and get some rest,
and I'll call you tomorrow.

01:27:33.749 --> 01:27:35.933
Listen, if you don't mind...

01:27:36.418 --> 01:27:38.769
I'd like to sit here for a while.

01:27:39.504 --> 01:27:41.564
It would make me feel better.

01:27:41.673 --> 01:27:43.399
Sure. I understand.

01:27:44.384 --> 01:27:46.569
I'll call you tomorrow. Sweetie?

01:27:47.346 --> 01:27:50.656
Dr. Kingsley. Call Dr. Faraday
in X-Ray 1.

01:27:50.766 --> 01:27:54.368
Dr. Kingsley.
Call Dr. Faraday in X-Ray 1.

01:27:54.478 --> 01:27:56.370
You want some coffee?

01:27:57.481 --> 01:28:00.791
The man yells at me on the stage
and gets a million laughs.

01:28:01.443 --> 01:28:04.920
He yells at me off the stage,
he gets a heart attack.

01:28:22.839 --> 01:28:25.733
- Clark?
- I'll take them. Thank you.

01:28:26.927 --> 01:28:29.028
I'm a nurse. I don't tip.

01:28:42.859 --> 01:28:45.795
I hear that!
Don't you think I hear that?

01:28:45.904 --> 01:28:47.296
I'm sorry.

01:28:48.031 --> 01:28:51.425
Call the Spanish kid.
Tell him. They'll get somebody.

01:28:52.911 --> 01:28:54.136
Who knocked?

01:28:54.246 --> 01:28:56.055
More flowers. No card.

01:28:56.790 --> 01:28:58.724
They stink up the room.

01:28:59.835 --> 01:29:01.435
What happened to my candy?

01:29:01.545 --> 01:29:04.814
- Did you eat up all my candy?
- You can't eat it anyway.

01:29:04.923 --> 01:29:07.024
Because I'm not quick enough.

01:29:07.134 --> 01:29:09.985
You got the fastest fingers
on the West Side.

01:29:10.137 --> 01:29:12.780
When you're through,
I wish you'd eat the flowers, too.

01:29:12.889 --> 01:29:14.824
If I was you, I'd go back to sleep.

01:29:14.933 --> 01:29:18.160
And if I was you,
I'd be in that new musical.

01:29:18.979 --> 01:29:22.665
When you're through gardening,
maybe you'll find time to take my pulse.

01:29:22.774 --> 01:29:24.458
I did. It's a little better today.

01:29:24.568 --> 01:29:27.128
- When did you take my pulse?
- When you were sleeping.

01:29:27.237 --> 01:29:30.172
Everybody's pulse is better
when you're sleeping.

01:29:30.282 --> 01:29:32.758
You take a person's pulse
when they're up.

01:29:32.868 --> 01:29:35.719
$40 a day, and she takes
a sleeping pulse.

01:29:35.829 --> 01:29:39.348
- Did you have a nice nap?
- It was a nap. Nothing special.

01:29:39.791 --> 01:29:42.184
How about a little pinochle?
Two cents a point.

01:29:42.294 --> 01:29:43.644
I don't gamble.

01:29:44.087 --> 01:29:48.524
- If you win, I'll let you eat the cards.
- Funny. Really funny, Mr. Clark.

01:29:48.633 --> 01:29:51.277
Soon as I get home,
I'm gonna bust out laughing.

01:29:51.386 --> 01:29:54.530
If they send me any more candy,
you'll bust out a lot sooner.

01:29:54.639 --> 01:29:57.074
You've been trying to get my goat
for a week now.

01:29:57.184 --> 01:30:00.035
If you had a goat,
you'd have eaten it by now.

01:30:00.395 --> 01:30:03.205
You do, and I'll treat you
for a concussion.

01:30:03.315 --> 01:30:05.708
I was just kidding.
Can't you take a joke?

01:30:05.817 --> 01:30:07.460
I can take anything from you...

01:30:07.569 --> 01:30:10.212
because I have
a wonderful sense of humor.

01:30:10.906 --> 01:30:14.133
If you nurse as good
as your sense of humor...

01:30:14.284 --> 01:30:16.552
I won't make it to Thursday.

01:30:20.707 --> 01:30:23.726
- By summer, we'll have two tennis courts.
- Tennis courts?

01:30:23.835 --> 01:30:27.146
You'd be surprised
how active some of our people still are.

01:30:27.255 --> 01:30:30.524
You've seen the dining room.
That takes in just about everything.

01:30:30.634 --> 01:30:33.736
As I said, if your uncle
would like to have a look around...

01:30:33.845 --> 01:30:35.321
I'd be pleased to arrange it.

01:30:35.430 --> 01:30:37.823
I'm sure he must have lots
of old friends out here.

01:30:37.933 --> 01:30:40.618
- I'm sure. We'll let you know, Mr. Ferranti.
- Good.

01:30:40.727 --> 01:30:43.704
- Helen.
- When do you think that might be?

01:30:43.814 --> 01:30:47.917
Soon as we let my uncle know about it.
We haven't discussed it with him yet.

01:30:48.151 --> 01:30:50.002
- Thank you.
- Goodbye.

01:30:55.617 --> 01:30:57.343
I was surprised.

01:30:57.452 --> 01:31:00.763
I thought it would be depressing.
It wasn't at all, was it?

01:31:01.039 --> 01:31:03.474
And the grounds are lovely, aren't they?

01:31:05.627 --> 01:31:08.062
I really think he might like it, Ben.

01:31:08.630 --> 01:31:10.105
I really do.

01:31:10.215 --> 01:31:13.943
I mean, if he gives it a chance,
I think he may like it, don't you?

01:31:15.971 --> 01:31:18.155
What are you gonna tell him?

01:31:45.125 --> 01:31:46.767
What did you do that for?

01:31:46.877 --> 01:31:49.144
- You owe me $40.
- For what?

01:31:49.337 --> 01:31:51.313
That's what you get
for watching me sleep.

01:31:51.423 --> 01:31:53.107
Why shouldn't I get the same money?

01:31:53.216 --> 01:31:55.442
Woke up a little grouchy today,
didn't we?

01:31:55.552 --> 01:31:57.820
We did? When did you get sick?

01:31:58.346 --> 01:31:59.572
What's this?

01:31:59.681 --> 01:32:01.073
Don't fluff up the pillows!

01:32:01.183 --> 01:32:03.826
It takes the whole night
to get them the way I like...

01:32:03.935 --> 01:32:07.371
- ...and then you fluff them the hell up!
- You just keep it up, Mr. Clark...

01:32:07.481 --> 01:32:09.498
and we're gonna have
another heart attack.

01:32:09.608 --> 01:32:10.708
Again my partner?

01:32:10.817 --> 01:32:13.335
And stop throwing your papers
on the floor.

01:32:13.445 --> 01:32:16.338
I get paid for nursing, not bending.

01:32:20.660 --> 01:32:23.929
Tell me something.
How old is a woman like you?

01:32:24.039 --> 01:32:26.974
- That's none of your business.
- I'm not asking for business.

01:32:27.083 --> 01:32:29.184
- Fifty-four.
- Ah.

01:32:29.294 --> 01:32:30.769
You married?

01:32:31.713 --> 01:32:34.773
- My husband passed away four years ago.
- Oh.

01:32:34.883 --> 01:32:37.026
You were the nurse?

01:32:39.304 --> 01:32:41.947
No, I was not the nurse.

01:32:42.474 --> 01:32:45.242
Don't make up the bed.
I'm still sleeping in it.

01:32:45.352 --> 01:32:47.745
Don't make up a bed
with a person still in it.

01:32:49.022 --> 01:32:51.040
Hey, Uncle Willy.

01:32:51.149 --> 01:32:52.875
- Hi, Odessa. How are you?
- Hello.

01:32:52.984 --> 01:32:55.294
- You look terrific.
- You got my Variety?

01:32:55.403 --> 01:32:58.797
Yeah, and about 150 get-well cards
from people all over the country.

01:32:58.907 --> 01:33:01.550
Telegrams from Milton Berle,
Lucille Ball, Bob Hope...

01:33:01.660 --> 01:33:03.052
every comic in show business.

01:33:03.161 --> 01:33:06.221
What about a commercial?
Did you speak to the Alka-Seltzer people?

01:33:06.331 --> 01:33:08.390
- Talk about that later.
- I'm going to lunch.

01:33:08.500 --> 01:33:10.768
If he needs his pill,
it's on the bureau.

01:33:10.877 --> 01:33:15.230
And don't get up and go to the bathroom.
Use the you-know-what.

01:33:15.340 --> 01:33:17.816
And if not, I'll go you-know-where.

01:33:18.927 --> 01:33:20.903
- Have a good lunch.
- Thank you.

01:33:21.263 --> 01:33:25.574
- She's really a terrific nurse.
- Boy. Bernie Eisenstein died.

01:33:25.684 --> 01:33:27.284
- Who?
- Bernie Eisenstein.

01:33:27.394 --> 01:33:29.662
Remember the dance team,
Ramona and Rodriguez?

01:33:29.771 --> 01:33:32.289
Bernie Eisenstein was Rodriguez.

01:33:32.399 --> 01:33:35.084
Uh, Uncle Willy,
could you put down the Variety?

01:33:35.193 --> 01:33:36.752
Did you bring me a cigar?

01:33:36.861 --> 01:33:39.546
A cigar? Don't you realize
you just had a heart attack?

01:33:39.656 --> 01:33:41.715
It doesn't have to be a big one.

01:33:41.825 --> 01:33:45.135
You heard the doctor.
You know you can't have any more cigars.

01:33:45.245 --> 01:33:47.805
No more corned beef sandwiches,
no more temper tantrums.

01:33:47.914 --> 01:33:49.765
Your heart's just not gonna take it.

01:33:49.874 --> 01:33:54.436
This is the good news you rushed up with?
You could have skipped a Wednesday.

01:33:55.213 --> 01:33:57.481
I talked to the doctor again
this morning...

01:33:57.591 --> 01:34:01.110
and I'm gonna have to be very frank
and honest with you, Willy.

01:34:01.720 --> 01:34:03.320
You've got to retire.

01:34:03.555 --> 01:34:04.822
Give it up.

01:34:04.931 --> 01:34:06.573
Show business is out.

01:34:07.142 --> 01:34:08.992
- Until when?
- Until ever.

01:34:09.185 --> 01:34:12.746
You were lucky this time, but you can't
go running around looking for jobs.

01:34:12.856 --> 01:34:14.790
- You can't take it.
- I'll think it over.

01:34:14.899 --> 01:34:18.711
There's nothing to think over. You can't
work anymore. Can't you understand that?

01:34:18.820 --> 01:34:21.422
You decide for Ben Clark.
I'll decide for Willy Clark.

01:34:21.531 --> 01:34:23.382
No, I'll decide for Willy Clark.

01:34:23.491 --> 01:34:27.094
I'm your only living relative,
and I'm responsible for your welfare.

01:34:27.203 --> 01:34:30.431
You can't live here anymore, Willy,
not alone.

01:34:30.915 --> 01:34:33.142
I can't afford
to keep this nurse permanently.

01:34:33.251 --> 01:34:35.227
Right now, she's making more than I am.

01:34:35.337 --> 01:34:38.272
Anyway, she already gave me a notice.
She's leaving next week.

01:34:38.381 --> 01:34:40.941
She's going to Buffalo
to work for some rich family.

01:34:41.051 --> 01:34:43.819
Maybe she'll take me.
I always did well in Buffalo.

01:34:45.263 --> 01:34:47.656
We have to face the facts, Willy.

01:34:49.267 --> 01:34:52.369
We have to do something,
and we have to do it quickly.

01:34:52.520 --> 01:34:56.165
I can't think about it today.
I'm tired. I'm gonna take a nap.

01:34:57.150 --> 01:35:00.335
- Want to hear my suggestion?
- Don't you see me napping?

01:35:00.945 --> 01:35:03.547
I'd like you to move in with me
and Helen and the kids.

01:35:03.657 --> 01:35:07.134
We have a spare room,
and I think you'd be very comfortable.

01:35:08.953 --> 01:35:10.637
Did you hear what I said?

01:35:10.747 --> 01:35:12.222
- Forget it.
- Why?

01:35:12.332 --> 01:35:14.600
I don't like your kids.
They're too noisy.

01:35:14.709 --> 01:35:17.561
The little one hit me in the head
with a baseball bat.

01:35:17.671 --> 01:35:21.690
I've seen you talk to them for hours about
vaudeville and have the time of your life.

01:35:21.800 --> 01:35:24.109
If I stopped talking,
they'd hit me with the bat.

01:35:24.219 --> 01:35:26.695
No offense, but I'm not moving in
with your children.

01:35:26.805 --> 01:35:28.572
Get rid of them, then we'll talk.

01:35:28.682 --> 01:35:31.241
It's because Al Lewis
lives with his family, isn't it?

01:35:31.351 --> 01:35:34.411
You're trying to prove some stupid point
about being independent.

01:35:34.521 --> 01:35:36.371
Make your second suggestion.

01:35:38.692 --> 01:35:40.125
All right.

01:35:40.985 --> 01:35:44.087
Now, don't jump when I say this,
it's not as bad as it sounds.

01:35:44.197 --> 01:35:45.464
Say it.

01:35:46.491 --> 01:35:48.425
There's the actors' home in New Jersey.

01:35:48.535 --> 01:35:51.720
- It's as bad as it sounds.
- You're wrong. Helen and I saw the place.

01:35:51.830 --> 01:35:54.932
They showed us all around.
I couldn't believe how beautiful it was.

01:35:55.041 --> 01:35:57.643
You went out there?
You didn't even have the decency...

01:35:57.752 --> 01:36:00.813
to wait until I turned down living
with you and your rotten kids?

01:36:00.922 --> 01:36:03.982
I just went out to investigate.
There are no commitments.

01:36:04.092 --> 01:36:07.653
The old actors' home.
The first booking you got me in 10 years.

01:36:07.804 --> 01:36:10.697
It's on a lake.
It's got 25 wooded acres.

01:36:10.807 --> 01:36:13.450
They put on shows for themselves
every Friday and Saturday night.

01:36:13.560 --> 01:36:16.078
It's all old actors.
What could be better for you?

01:36:16.187 --> 01:36:18.080
It's in New Jersey. I hate New Jersey.

01:36:18.189 --> 01:36:21.416
I'm sorry they ever finished
the George Washington Bridge.

01:36:21.985 --> 01:36:23.377
I promise you...

01:36:23.486 --> 01:36:26.588
if you ever spend one day there
you're not happy...

01:36:26.906 --> 01:36:28.966
you can come back and move in with me.

01:36:29.075 --> 01:36:32.761
That's my choice:
the baseball bat or New Jersey.

01:36:36.374 --> 01:36:37.766
All right?

01:36:40.211 --> 01:36:41.979
I feel a lot better about everything.

01:36:43.631 --> 01:36:45.274
What about you?

01:36:47.177 --> 01:36:49.236
What do you mean, what about me?

01:36:50.555 --> 01:36:54.199
Does this mean that you won't come up
to see me anymore?

01:36:56.394 --> 01:36:58.745
Certainly, I'll come to see you.

01:36:59.814 --> 01:37:01.582
As often as I can.

01:37:04.694 --> 01:37:08.005
Uncle Willy, did you think
I wouldn't come to visit you anymore?

01:37:08.114 --> 01:37:12.175
You know, people don't go out
to New Jersey unless they have to.

01:37:14.788 --> 01:37:17.139
I'll be there every Wednesday.

01:37:17.707 --> 01:37:19.266
With Variety.

01:37:20.668 --> 01:37:22.853
I'll even bring Helen and the kids.

01:37:22.962 --> 01:37:24.104
Don't bring the kids.

01:37:24.214 --> 01:37:27.107
What do you think
I'm moving out there for?

01:37:33.264 --> 01:37:34.781
You know...

01:37:36.935 --> 01:37:39.953
this is the first moment
since I know you...

01:37:41.481 --> 01:37:44.708
that you've treated me like a nephew,
not as an agent.

01:37:46.736 --> 01:37:48.462
It's like a whole new relationship.

01:37:48.571 --> 01:37:51.465
I hope it works out a lot better
than the last one.

01:37:58.665 --> 01:38:01.558
Now, there's just one other thing
I'd like you to do for me.

01:38:01.668 --> 01:38:02.851
What?

01:38:02.961 --> 01:38:06.104
- But don't get excited.
- What is it, for God's sake?

01:38:06.256 --> 01:38:08.982
Al Lewis wants to come up and see you.

01:38:10.468 --> 01:38:13.779
Ben, if you wanted to kill me,
you could have brought the cigars.

01:38:13.888 --> 01:38:16.031
He's been heartsick
ever since this happened.

01:38:16.140 --> 01:38:18.659
What do you think I've been?
What is this, the mumps?

01:38:18.768 --> 01:38:20.911
He hasn't slept
since you've been in hospital.

01:38:21.020 --> 01:38:23.163
He's been sending
all this candy and flowers.

01:38:23.273 --> 01:38:26.041
He doesn't sign it,
because if he did you'd throw them out.

01:38:26.150 --> 01:38:27.960
They're his flowers? Throw them out.

01:38:29.153 --> 01:38:31.213
He just wants to come up and say hello.

01:38:31.322 --> 01:38:33.131
- Hello, huh?
- That's all.

01:38:33.283 --> 01:38:36.218
And if he pokes me in the chest
with his finger...

01:38:36.953 --> 01:38:39.388
I'll drop dead. That's murder, you know.

01:38:40.039 --> 01:38:44.226
Uncle Willy,
I'm asking you as a personal favor...

01:38:44.794 --> 01:38:47.354
even if you never spoke to him again...

01:38:47.463 --> 01:38:49.731
just let him come up and say hello.

01:38:50.341 --> 01:38:52.234
Please. For me, Uncle Willy.

01:38:52.343 --> 01:38:56.238
All right, if he wants to come up,
I won't stop him.

01:38:56.681 --> 01:38:59.825
But I can't promise a hello.
I may be sleeping.

01:39:00.143 --> 01:39:03.120
- I could kiss you.
- Please, I'm sick enough.

01:39:04.731 --> 01:39:07.749
- Where are you going?
- Got to make a call.

01:39:07.859 --> 01:39:09.918
- Who are you calling?
- AI Lewis.

01:39:10.361 --> 01:39:12.462
Al Lewis? On my phone?

01:39:13.114 --> 01:39:16.800
It's got to cost me 60 cents
for him to come up to say hello?

01:39:16.910 --> 01:39:19.928
It's not going to cost you 60 cents.
He's down in the lobby now.

01:39:20.038 --> 01:39:23.682
Now? So why do you bother asking me?

01:39:23.875 --> 01:39:26.643
Yes. Right. Sure.

01:39:27.420 --> 01:39:28.687
Mr. Lewis?

01:39:30.214 --> 01:39:33.525
- Yes. What is it?
- The man from Mr. Clark's room said...

01:39:33.635 --> 01:39:36.445
if you want to go to see Mr. Clark
in his room...

01:39:36.554 --> 01:39:38.780
that you can go upstairs right now.

01:39:41.225 --> 01:39:42.534
What did he say?

01:39:43.478 --> 01:39:44.953
Where is he?

01:39:45.271 --> 01:39:47.539
Maybe he got off at the wrong floor.

01:39:52.320 --> 01:39:55.630
What are you doing?
You're not supposed to get out of bed.

01:39:56.699 --> 01:39:57.799
Willy, please.

01:39:57.909 --> 01:40:00.385
I'm not gonna give him
the satisfaction...

01:40:00.495 --> 01:40:03.388
of seeing me lay in bed
like a sick person.

01:40:03.665 --> 01:40:06.141
I'm gonna sit in my chair...

01:40:06.334 --> 01:40:10.020
- ...and look healthier than him.
- Uncle Willy. Uncle Willy.

01:40:13.591 --> 01:40:16.985
I'm begging you. You're not supposed
to get out of bed for anything.

01:40:17.095 --> 01:40:21.114
Lewis coming to apologize to Clark...

01:40:21.224 --> 01:40:22.699
is not anything.

01:40:22.809 --> 01:40:25.786
To me, this is worth
another heart attack.

01:40:25.937 --> 01:40:28.330
Go to the closet and get my coat.

01:40:28.439 --> 01:40:30.665
- Get my coat, Ben.
- All right.

01:40:34.487 --> 01:40:36.797
I'll do it. Okay. I'll do it.

01:40:36.906 --> 01:40:39.841
- All right. Move the chair.
- I'll get the chair.

01:40:39.951 --> 01:40:41.760
Move the chair all the way back.

01:40:41.869 --> 01:40:44.971
I want that son of a bitch
to have a long walk.

01:40:45.081 --> 01:40:46.973
Walk slowly, will you?

01:40:47.792 --> 01:40:50.393
He's not coming to apologize.
He's coming to say hello.

01:40:50.503 --> 01:40:53.897
If he doesn't apologize,
for spite, I'll drop dead in the chair.

01:40:54.007 --> 01:40:56.024
Push the chair back all the way...

01:40:56.134 --> 01:40:59.444
and get some pillows
and put the pillows on the chair.

01:40:59.554 --> 01:41:02.823
I want to look down on that bastard.

01:41:02.932 --> 01:41:04.699
This is the last time.

01:41:05.143 --> 01:41:07.702
I'm never butting into your lives again.

01:41:08.354 --> 01:41:11.998
But promise me
you'll be decent to Al Lewis.

01:41:12.108 --> 01:41:15.669
I'll be wonderful to him.
In my will, I'll leave him you.

01:41:15.778 --> 01:41:18.255
I can't wait for him to apologize, Ben.

01:41:18.364 --> 01:41:22.801
For 11 years
I've waited for this minute and...

01:41:25.163 --> 01:41:26.930
- I'll get it.
- Oop.

01:41:27.040 --> 01:41:28.348
Stay where you are.

01:41:28.458 --> 01:41:29.933
This is my line.

01:41:30.960 --> 01:41:32.727
Enter!

01:41:44.640 --> 01:41:46.158
He's sleeping.

01:41:46.267 --> 01:41:48.118
I could come back later.

01:41:48.936 --> 01:41:51.079
No. He's just dozing.

01:41:51.522 --> 01:41:52.789
Come on in.

01:41:54.984 --> 01:41:56.835
- Can I take your hat?
- No.

01:41:56.944 --> 01:42:00.297
I'd like to hold on to something,
if you don't mind.

01:42:03.576 --> 01:42:06.178
Uncle Willy,
there's someone here to see you.

01:42:08.831 --> 01:42:11.266
Look who's here to see you, Willy.

01:42:11.375 --> 01:42:13.435
I don't have my glasses.

01:42:14.378 --> 01:42:15.770
Who is it?

01:42:15.880 --> 01:42:17.814
It's me, Willy, Al.

01:42:20.093 --> 01:42:21.610
Al who?

01:42:22.470 --> 01:42:23.820
Al Lewis!

01:42:24.180 --> 01:42:25.739
Al Lewis.

01:42:26.724 --> 01:42:28.200
Is that you?

01:42:29.519 --> 01:42:33.788
You're so far away, Al.

01:42:37.235 --> 01:42:40.962
Walk all the way over here.

01:42:42.156 --> 01:42:44.216
All the way, Al.

01:42:44.784 --> 01:42:48.136
Come. Walk over here.

01:42:56.212 --> 01:42:58.146
Oh, that Al Lewis.

01:42:59.382 --> 01:43:01.650
I don't want
to disturb you, Willy. I just....

01:43:01.759 --> 01:43:05.320
Oh. Look at all the beautiful flowers.

01:43:08.724 --> 01:43:10.659
I'm throwing them out.

01:43:12.103 --> 01:43:14.246
They smell up the room.

01:43:14.939 --> 01:43:19.834
People send them to me
with boxes of cheap candy.

01:43:21.821 --> 01:43:23.463
They mean well.

01:43:23.614 --> 01:43:26.549
I don't want to take up your time.
I just came to say hello...

01:43:26.659 --> 01:43:28.677
so hello and goodbye, Willy.

01:43:28.786 --> 01:43:30.720
Wait a minute. What's your hurry?

01:43:30.830 --> 01:43:34.140
You got a few more minutes
before my next nap.

01:43:34.292 --> 01:43:38.019
Sit down and talk for a while.

01:43:38.963 --> 01:43:40.063
Sure it's okay?

01:43:40.631 --> 01:43:42.315
Please stay, Mr. Lewis.

01:43:42.425 --> 01:43:45.110
I've got to go find the nurse, anyway.

01:43:46.637 --> 01:43:48.947
I'll be back in a few minutes.

01:43:50.892 --> 01:43:53.076
Good to see you, Mr. Lewis.

01:43:53.603 --> 01:43:56.204
It's good to see
the both of you like this.

01:44:03.821 --> 01:44:05.171
Goodbye.

01:44:07.575 --> 01:44:08.967
Nice boy.

01:44:09.911 --> 01:44:14.889
So you got everything you need here?
Books, magazines?

01:44:15.124 --> 01:44:20.478
Oh, I got plenty to do.
I got all my fan mail to answer.

01:44:21.172 --> 01:44:22.897
You get fan mail?

01:44:23.049 --> 01:44:25.942
- Don't you?
- I don't even get jury duty.

01:44:27.136 --> 01:44:29.779
Listen, is it all right
for you to talk like this?

01:44:29.889 --> 01:44:32.824
I'm not talking.
You're the one who's talking.

01:44:33.392 --> 01:44:37.537
Why, is there something special
you wanted to talk about?

01:44:38.022 --> 01:44:39.372
Like what?

01:44:39.482 --> 01:44:42.167
What do I know?
How do I know what's on your mind?

01:44:42.276 --> 01:44:45.045
Do I know why you can't sleep at night?

01:44:45.404 --> 01:44:48.840
Who said I don't sleep at night?
I sleep beautifully.

01:44:50.409 --> 01:44:53.428
Funny. To me, you look tired...

01:44:53.996 --> 01:44:55.597
a little troubled...

01:44:56.290 --> 01:45:00.685
like a person with something
on their conscience. What do I know?

01:45:01.545 --> 01:45:03.855
I got nothing on my conscience.

01:45:04.882 --> 01:45:06.608
Are you sure you looked good?

01:45:06.717 --> 01:45:10.278
I got nothing on my conscience.
I'm just sorry you got sick.

01:45:10.721 --> 01:45:14.366
Thank you. I accept your apology.

01:45:14.892 --> 01:45:17.202
What apology? Who apologized?

01:45:18.896 --> 01:45:21.498
You don't apologize for making me sick?

01:45:21.607 --> 01:45:24.376
I never made you sick.
You made you sick.

01:45:24.902 --> 01:45:27.545
You yelled and screamed
and carried on like a lunatic...

01:45:27.655 --> 01:45:30.799
until you got yourself sick,
and for that, I'm sorry.

01:45:31.951 --> 01:45:35.095
Then why do you come here
with your hat in your hand?

01:45:35.788 --> 01:45:37.430
It's a $35 hat.

01:45:38.082 --> 01:45:40.850
What did you want me to do?
Fold it in my pocket?

01:45:40.960 --> 01:45:44.104
Then why did you send me
the candy and flowers?

01:45:44.422 --> 01:45:47.148
Because you had something
on your conscience...

01:45:47.258 --> 01:45:49.317
and that's why
you couldn't sleep at night.

01:45:49.427 --> 01:45:52.362
That's why you came with your hat
in your hand, to apologize...

01:45:52.471 --> 01:45:54.989
only this time,
I'm not going to accept your apology.

01:45:55.099 --> 01:45:56.658
How do you like that?

01:45:57.601 --> 01:46:00.078
For this I paid a dollar toll
on the bridge.

01:46:00.187 --> 01:46:01.871
I'll pay for it...

01:46:02.064 --> 01:46:03.957
because I'm happy now.

01:46:04.525 --> 01:46:06.292
I got what I want.

01:46:07.111 --> 01:46:08.628
What did you get?

01:46:08.738 --> 01:46:12.090
You got no apology from me
which you didn't accept.

01:46:15.202 --> 01:46:18.638
I don't want to discuss it anymore.
I just had a heart attack.

01:46:19.206 --> 01:46:21.057
You know something, Willy?

01:46:21.500 --> 01:46:23.977
I don't think we get along too good.

01:46:24.295 --> 01:46:26.855
Everybody has their ups and downs.

01:46:27.298 --> 01:46:30.358
In 43 years, we had maybe one ups.

01:46:31.469 --> 01:46:34.529
To tell you the truth,
I can't take the downs anymore.

01:46:34.930 --> 01:46:39.451
To be honest with you, for the first time,
I feel a little tired myself.

01:46:41.562 --> 01:46:43.580
So, what are you gonna do now?

01:46:43.689 --> 01:46:46.040
My nephew made me
two very good offers...

01:46:46.150 --> 01:46:48.835
one in the city, and one out of town.

01:46:49.528 --> 01:46:53.381
I wouldn't have to work too hard.
Just do a show on Saturday nights.

01:46:54.325 --> 01:46:55.592
Is that so?

01:46:55.701 --> 01:46:57.552
Which one are you gonna take?

01:46:57.661 --> 01:47:01.139
I decided the one out of town.
I always liked the road. You know that.

01:47:01.248 --> 01:47:03.057
Isn't that wonderful?

01:47:03.542 --> 01:47:05.852
- And how about you?
- Wonderful news.

01:47:06.087 --> 01:47:08.438
My daughter is having another baby.

01:47:08.839 --> 01:47:12.233
They're gonna need my room,
and I don't want to be a burden to them.

01:47:12.343 --> 01:47:17.071
We talked it over and I decided to move
into the actors' home in New Brunswick.

01:47:21.477 --> 01:47:22.744
Oh, my God.

01:47:23.771 --> 01:47:25.747
I got the finger again.

01:47:26.440 --> 01:47:28.208
Willy, are you all right?

01:47:28.317 --> 01:47:32.045
- What is it, chest pains?
- Not yet, but I'm expecting.

01:47:32.696 --> 01:47:34.672
Can I get you anything?

01:47:34.907 --> 01:47:37.884
- Should I call the doctor?
- He's all the way uptown.

01:47:37.993 --> 01:47:39.719
So why did you get sick downtown?

01:47:41.330 --> 01:47:44.265
- Was that joke from our act?
- Who knows?

01:47:44.708 --> 01:47:48.102
I can't tell the difference
between our act and us anymore.

01:47:50.005 --> 01:47:53.983
You're a funny man, Al,
a pain in the ass, but a funny man.

01:47:55.428 --> 01:47:57.779
You know what your trouble was, Willy?

01:47:58.222 --> 01:48:00.782
You always took the jokes too seriously.

01:48:01.142 --> 01:48:02.825
They were just jokes.

01:48:03.144 --> 01:48:07.664
We did comedy on the stage for 43 years.
I don't think you enjoyed it once.

01:48:07.773 --> 01:48:10.875
If I was there to enjoy it,
I would buy a ticket.

01:48:10.985 --> 01:48:13.127
Maybe now you'll start enjoying it.

01:48:13.237 --> 01:48:14.462
If you're not too busy...

01:48:14.572 --> 01:48:17.215
maybe you'll come over
and visit me at the actors' home.

01:48:17.324 --> 01:48:20.927
- You can count on it.
- Maybe you'd like to rest now, take a nap.

01:48:21.162 --> 01:48:22.887
- Yeah, I think so.
- Come on.

01:48:22.997 --> 01:48:26.057
There you are. Okay?

01:48:27.042 --> 01:48:30.103
- There you are. Put you right there.
- Unh.

01:48:30.754 --> 01:48:32.647
Just get comfortable.

01:48:34.049 --> 01:48:37.485
You know, I feel a lot better
now that I've talked to you.

01:48:37.595 --> 01:48:40.071
Yeah. Keep talking, I'll fall asleep.

01:48:40.848 --> 01:48:43.324
What's, uh...? What's new in Variety?

01:48:44.226 --> 01:48:47.120
- Bernie Eisenstein died.
- Go on.

01:48:47.229 --> 01:48:50.081
Bernie Eisenstein?
The House Doctor at the Palace?

01:48:51.734 --> 01:48:53.585
The was Sam Hesseltein.

01:48:54.195 --> 01:48:57.213
Bernie Eisenstein
was Ramona and Rodriguez.

01:48:57.323 --> 01:49:00.300
No, Jackie Aronson
was Ramona and Rodriguez.

01:49:00.743 --> 01:49:03.303
Bernie Eisenstein was
the House Doctor at the Palace.

01:49:04.788 --> 01:49:06.848
Sam Hesseltein
was Sophie Tucker's agent.

01:49:06.957 --> 01:49:09.225
Don't argue with me. I'm sick.

01:49:09.502 --> 01:49:12.270
- I know, but why should I get sick, too?
- Leave me alone.

01:49:12.379 --> 01:49:16.608
Bernie Eisenstein was the house doctor
the first time we played with Sophie...

01:49:16.717 --> 01:49:19.777
- ...and that's when we met Sam Hesseltein.
- God help me.

01:49:20.346 --> 01:49:23.197
And Jackie Aronson wasn't Rodriguez yet.

01:49:23.474 --> 01:49:25.033
He was Dimarco and Lopez.

01:49:25.142 --> 01:49:29.037
Lopez died, Dimarco went into real estate,
so Jackie became Rodriguez.

01:49:29.146 --> 01:49:30.872
Who the hell cares?

01:49:30.981 --> 01:49:33.708
- And I'll never forget this.
- Forget it!

01:49:34.276 --> 01:49:36.127
Remember Big Bill Macafree?

01:49:36.654 --> 01:49:39.714
The Irishman who owned
the Adams Theater in Pittsburgh...

01:49:39.823 --> 01:49:43.593
and the Baltimore in Syracuse?
Always wore a two-pound diamond ring.

01:49:43.869 --> 01:49:45.470
He said some very funny things.

01:49:45.579 --> 01:49:47.263
Would you like to hear them?

01:49:47.373 --> 01:49:48.556
Yeah.

01:49:48.666 --> 01:49:51.225
Here's what he said.
You remember Dunlap and Rosita?

01:49:51.335 --> 01:49:53.269
He used to go around with Rosita...

01:49:53.379 --> 01:49:56.356
and Rosita wore a little black
velvet ribbon on her neck.

01:49:56.465 --> 01:50:00.735
She tied it tight, because she was skinny
and she wanted her cheeks to puff up.

01:50:01.512 --> 01:50:04.405
But she tied it so tight,
it affected her hearing.

01:50:04.515 --> 01:50:06.407
She couldn't hear the music.
