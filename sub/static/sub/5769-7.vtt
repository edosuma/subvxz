00:02.370 --> 00:04.019
MAN (recording):
Come ti chiami?

00:04.070 --> 00:05.219
MAN :_
Come tI...

00:05.270 --> 00:07.067
Come ti chiami?

00:07.100 --> 00:09.136
Come ti chiami?

00:09.170 --> 00:11.138
Come ti chiami?

00:11.170 --> 00:12.501
Come ti chiami?

00:12.540 --> 00:14.804
(siren wailing)
Come ti chiami?

00:14.840 --> 00:16.171
(recording continue)

00:16.210 --> 00:20.112
(siren continues wailing)

00:23.220 --> 00:25.541
(siren stops)

00:30.690 --> 00:32.624
Hi. How you doing?
Good.

00:32.660 --> 00:34.548
Could you hang up
the cell phone?

00:34.600 --> 00:36.363
Sure. I... I looked
at the speedometer--

00:36.400 --> 00:37.594
I was only going 35.

00:37.630 --> 00:40.736
Could I see your
driyer's license and
registration, please?

00:42.540 --> 00:44.064
You been drinking?

00:44.110 --> 00:45.361
Have... I...

00:45.410 --> 00:47.230
No, I'm... It's 3:00.

00:47.280 --> 00:49.748
I-I'm headed to class.
I smell alcohol
on your breath.

00:49.780 --> 00:51.099
Have you been drinking?

00:51.150 --> 00:52.117
No.

00:52.150 --> 00:53.174
You have a cold?

00:53.220 --> 00:54.517
Idid. Um...

00:54.550 --> 00:57.110
But I'm-I'm getting over it.
Did you know certain

00:57.150 --> 00:58.583
_cold medications can
Impact your faculties?

00:58.620 --> 01:00.588
Uh, yes, I...
But I'm fine.

01:00.620 --> 01:02.326
Seriously.
Then you
wouldn't mind

01:02.360 --> 01:04.419
if I administer
a Breathalyzer?

01:04.460 --> 01:06.291
No.
Good.

01:06.330 --> 01:08.321
Unfortunately, I don't
have one in the car.

01:08.360 --> 01:11.158
Would you mind accompanying
me to the station?

01:12.170 --> 01:13.660
(phone rings)

01:13.700 --> 01:15.531
Lockhart/Gardner.

01:15.570 --> 01:17.606
I'm sorry,
who would you like?

01:17.640 --> 01:20.575
Alicia Florrick.
Hold on, please.

01:20.610 --> 01:22.475
Be right back.

01:23.810 --> 01:26.813
(people clapping nearby)

01:29.890 --> 01:31.619
WILL:
Yes!

01:31.650 --> 01:32.719
It's excellent news.

01:32.760 --> 01:33.852
Welcome back,
Diane.

01:33.890 --> 01:35.209
Her first order
of busmess

01:35.260 --> 01:36.352
will be this_
malpractice swt...

01:37.390 --> 01:39.392
One second.

01:40.600 --> 01:41.555
You wanted me to tell you

01:41.600 --> 01:43.420
when any clients called
for Alicia or Cary.

01:43.470 --> 01:44.528
Yes. Who is it?

01:44.570 --> 01:46.435
Jeffrey Grant.

01:46.470 --> 01:48.438
Oh, Grant Real Estate.
Mid-level client.

01:48.470 --> 01:51.234
His dad was arrested
two months ago for assault.

01:51.270 --> 01:52.635
Alicia handled it.

01:52.680 --> 01:55.604
We don't want to lose them
to Alicia's firm.
Got it.

01:56.650 --> 01:57.776
Hello, Jeffrey.

01:57.810 --> 01:59.573
This is Will Gardner.
How's your dad?

01:59.620 --> 02:02.509
Uh, he's-he's good.

02:02.550 --> 02:04.245
He's... he's at home.

02:04.290 --> 02:05.314
Who is this?

02:05.350 --> 02:06.453
Will Gardner, Alicia's boss.

02:06.490 --> 02:07.855
Alicia no longer
works at the firm.

02:07.890 --> 02:09.482
But can you tell
me your issue?

02:09.530 --> 02:11.282
I'd love to see
what I can do.

02:11.330 --> 02:13.719
Well, yeah. I don't know,
something's weird here. I got...

02:13.760 --> 02:15.421
pulled over
for I guess speeding.

02:15.460 --> 02:17.724
And they say I've been drinking,
but I haven't.

02:17.770 --> 02:19.260
Do you have Alicia's number?

02:19.300 --> 02:21.439
I don't, actually.
Where are you now?

02:21.470 --> 02:23.335
JEFFREY:
It's the 29th District.

02:23.370 --> 02:25.201
I've been waiting
for a Breathalyzer,

02:25.240 --> 02:26.309
but it's been, like, an hour.

02:26.340 --> 02:29.343
DAVID:
I bring in more capital
into this firm...

02:29.380 --> 02:30.847
Why don't I come on down there
and see what I can do.

02:30.880 --> 02:31.972
DIANE:
Both of you, please!

02:32.010 --> 02:34.444
Of course you don't have
malpractice suits in tax law.

02:34.480 --> 02:35.469
Who gives a damn
about tax law?

02:35.520 --> 02:36.646
WILL:
Okay, stop it.

02:36.690 --> 02:38.908
Listen to me, all of you.

02:38.950 --> 02:41.282
There are no more fights
at this firm.

02:41.320 --> 02:43.652
No more internal squabbles.

02:43.690 --> 02:46.193
We work together.
Now, this malpractice suit

02:46.230 --> 02:48.255
is an irritant,
but it can't slow us down

02:48.300 --> 02:50.461
unless we let it slow us down,
do you understand?

02:50.500 --> 02:52.297
Move together,

02:52.340 --> 02:54.535
act together, or leave.

02:54.570 --> 02:56.731
That's all I want:
to act together.

02:56.770 --> 02:57.862
Diane, you take it.

02:57.910 --> 02:58.934
Where are you going?

02:58.970 --> 03:00.835
Out to stop a client
from leaving.

03:00.880 --> 03:03.678
So, insurance has reviewed the
$6 million lawsuit against us

03:03.710 --> 03:06.543
and denied coverage
due to "attorney recklessness."

03:06.580 --> 03:08.241
I wasn't
reckless.

03:08.280 --> 03:09.816
It was a failed adoption.

03:09.850 --> 03:12.216
Emotions run high in adoptions.
This was

03:12.260 --> 03:13.056
the Gopniks?
Yes,

03:13.090 --> 03:14.057
they adopted
a two-month-old girl,

03:14.090 --> 03:16.627
but the genetic parents
fought to get her back.

03:16.660 --> 03:19.527
I told them that
it was unlikely we would win.

03:19.560 --> 03:20.788
They're disgruntled.
They're lashing out.

03:20.830 --> 03:22.263
Seen it before.
Who was

03:22.300 --> 03:25.360
the associate supervisor?
I don't know. I was
on the Zander divorce.

03:25.400 --> 03:27.766
I put it into the rotation.
Well, the depositions
start tomorrow,

03:27.800 --> 03:28.892
and we have to prep someone,

03:28.940 --> 03:30.430
so_which associate
Signed off on it?

03:30.470 --> 03:32.529
Want to guess?

03:34.580 --> 03:36.275
CARY:
We're in financial trouble.

03:36.310 --> 03:38.244
ANTHONY:
We didn't get our bonuses.

03:38.280 --> 03:40.510
Oh, come on, Anthony,
would you stop with
the bonus talk?

03:40.550 --> 03:42.586
ALICIA: What if we lower
our sights on office space?

03:42.620 --> 03:44.440
Look further south.
The problem is
the length of the lease.

03:44.490 --> 03:46.958
We don't want to get trapped
in someplace too downscale.
And Chumhum?

03:46.990 --> 03:48.787
We won't see their retainer
money for another 45 days.

03:48.820 --> 03:50.959
ANTHONY: We won't see it at all
if they realize

03:50.990 --> 03:52.423
what a shoestring
we're running...
Oh, come... they...

03:52.460 --> 03:55.327
(several talking at once)

04:28.000 --> 04:30.992
(several talking at once)

04:37.110 --> 04:39.408
Were you chatting
on Mom's computer earlier?

04:39.440 --> 04:41.078
What? Can you knock?

04:41.110 --> 04:42.577
Were you using Mom's computer?

04:42.610 --> 04:44.077
No. Why?

04:44.110 --> 04:45.748
Her Webcam was on.

04:45.780 --> 04:48.977
ALICIA:
Okay, look, we all knew
this would be hard.

04:49.020 --> 04:50.612
Every new firm has...

04:50.650 --> 04:52.754
(doorbell rings)
their struggles.

04:52.790 --> 04:55.611
_Stern-_Lockhart started
in an airport hotel room.

04:55.660 --> 04:56.820
So hold it together.

04:56.860 --> 04:59.852
What we're going through now
will make our firm stronger.

04:59.900 --> 05:02.698
Alicia Florrick?
Yep.

05:02.730 --> 05:03.924
Subpoena or restraining order?

05:03.970 --> 05:06.495
Subpoena. You guys
should get an office.

05:06.540 --> 05:08.895
It's hard to ﬁnd you.
We'll get right on that.

05:11.570 --> 05:13.538
Lockhart/Gardner?

05:13.580 --> 05:15.036
Are we being sued?

05:15.080 --> 05:16.707
Because I'm thinking
we should countersue,

05:16.750 --> 05:18.604
stop playing defense.
No.

05:18.650 --> 05:19.776
They're being sued.

05:19.820 --> 05:21.344
What?

05:21.380 --> 05:23.519
Then why are you being served?

05:23.550 --> 05:25.040
I'm a witness.

05:25.090 --> 05:28.651
(garbled police radio
transmissions)

05:28.690 --> 05:31.079
You must be Jeffrey?

05:31.130 --> 05:32.927
Mr. Gardner?
Uh, Will's fine.

05:32.960 --> 05:35.690
I'm sorry I'm late.
You doing some homework?

05:35.730 --> 05:38.062
Italian.
Have they tested you yet?

05:38.100 --> 05:40.933
No. I saw the patrolman
go by here a minute ago.

05:40.970 --> 05:42.403
There he is.

05:42.440 --> 05:44.465
WILL:
Okay.

05:44.510 --> 05:46.375
Now, you just sit tight.

05:53.450 --> 05:56.419
Jeffrey, what did the patrolman
say when he stopped you?

05:56.450 --> 05:57.815
What did he say?

05:57.850 --> 06:00.717
He said... he smelled
alcohol on my breath.

06:00.760 --> 06:02.819
But he saw I had
cold medicine.

06:02.860 --> 06:04.885
He said that
must be it. Why?

06:04.930 --> 06:07.592
Nothing. There's an ASA
over there talking with him.

06:07.630 --> 06:09.769
Yeah, she was in
the patrol car.

06:09.800 --> 06:11.688
She was in the patrol car?

06:11.730 --> 06:13.459
Yes.

06:15.170 --> 06:17.968
And you haven't gotten
a Breathalyzer yet?
No.

06:18.010 --> 06:21.002
And they took a... cotton
swab from inside my mouth.

06:21.040 --> 06:22.473
What... they... Why?

06:22.510 --> 06:23.943
They didn't say.

06:23.980 --> 06:25.743
Should I be worried?

06:25.780 --> 06:26.815
Not yet.

06:26.850 --> 06:29.489
Have you had any other brushes
with the law, Jeffrey?

06:29.520 --> 06:31.841
I had some issues when
I was in high school.

06:31.890 --> 06:33.881
I got pulled over on
another DUI, but...

06:33.920 --> 06:35.785
I would never drink
and drive again.

06:35.820 --> 06:37.651
Okay. Don't worry.
I'll be right back.

06:39.960 --> 06:41.791
Geneva, what's
going on here?

06:41.830 --> 06:44.765
What do you mean?
What I mean is,
why is an ASA

06:44.800 --> 06:47.462
out stopping a college
student on a phony DUI?
I don't know

06:47.500 --> 06:50.537
why you're calling it phony.
Well, an hour after the
pull-over, and still

06:50.570 --> 06:51.935
no Breathalyzer,
no blood test?

06:51.970 --> 06:54.871
Every time he pees,
your case is literally
going down the toilet.

06:54.910 --> 06:57.003
But you swabbed for DNA,
which is irrelevant

06:57.050 --> 06:59.644
to sobriety.
We were just trying
to be diligent, Will.

06:59.680 --> 07:01.739
Ah. That's what it's called?

07:01.780 --> 07:03.748
Well, I'm taking my
client home, okay?

07:03.790 --> 07:05.746
And I want you to
discard that DNA.

07:05.790 --> 07:07.485
Have a good day.

07:07.520 --> 07:09.659
Actually, no.

07:09.690 --> 07:12.750
Your_client is under arrest
for drivmg under the influence,

07:12.800 --> 07:13.698
and given
his previous arrests,

07:13.730 --> 07:15.891
we were with our rights
to collect his DNA.

07:15.930 --> 07:17.522
You're opening
yourself up to a suit.

07:17.570 --> 07:21.097
I breathe in the morning,
I'm opening myself up to a suit.

07:24.010 --> 07:26.899
Okay, they've arrested you,
but clearly,

07:26.940 --> 07:28.908
they're after
something else.
They arrested me? Why?

07:28.940 --> 07:30.043
I don't know, but...

07:30.080 --> 07:31.900
I need you to breathe into this.

07:31.950 --> 07:33.975
WILL: Your Honor,
the blood alcohol limit

07:34.020 --> 07:37.888
for inebriation
in Illinois is 0.08%.

07:37.920 --> 07:39.808
According
to this pocket Breathalyzer,

07:39.860 --> 07:41.782
my client's
blood alcohol concentration

07:41.820 --> 07:44.789
was 0.00001.

07:44.830 --> 07:46.718
That's a whole lot
of zeroes, Mrs. ASA.

07:46.760 --> 07:49.024
Sounds to me like you
pulled over the wrong kid.

07:49.060 --> 07:50.664
My apologies, Your Honor.

07:50.700 --> 07:52.167
The State is prepared
to dismiss the charge.

07:52.200 --> 07:54.065
It was _our mistake.
We apologize to Mr. Grant.

07:54.100 --> 07:55.829
WILL: If the State is
dropping the arrest,

07:55.870 --> 07:57.861
we ask that the DNA swab
collected from my client

07:57.910 --> 07:59.104
be destroyed, too.
We'd love to,

07:59.140 --> 08:00.869
Your Honor,
but we're rearresting Mr. Grant

08:00.910 --> 08:02.207
on a murder charge.

08:02.240 --> 08:03.776
What?

08:03.810 --> 08:05.641
We're arresting
Mr. Grant for the murder

08:05.680 --> 08:07.216
of Dani Littlejohn,
a college student

08:07.250 --> 08:08.945
who was found outside her dorm

08:08.980 --> 08:11.585
on the Chicago Poly Tech campus
last August

08:11.620 --> 08:13.110
with blunt trauma
to her skill.

08:13.160 --> 08:15.549
That's quite a step up
from a DUI.
It is.

08:15.590 --> 08:16.989
And as you can see

08:17.030 --> 08:19.089
from this report,
Miss Littlejohn

08:19.130 --> 08:20.051
struggled
with her killer,

08:20.100 --> 08:22.796
whose DNA was found
under her fingernails.

08:22.830 --> 08:25.492
Your Honor...
Hold on, Counselor.

08:27.600 --> 08:29.659
Here, take a look at this.

08:29.710 --> 08:31.860
GENEVA:
We had no match
for this DNA evidence

08:31.910 --> 08:34.606
until two months ago, when his
father was arrested for assault.

08:34.640 --> 08:36.847
As part of the father's
standard processing,

08:36.880 --> 08:41.249
his DNA was taken and entered
into the statewide database,
where we got a hit--

08:41.280 --> 08:44.784
a familial match
for Dani Littlejohn's killer.
A familial match.

08:44.820 --> 08:48.085
So the killer could be anybody
in that kid's family.
Yes, any male

08:48.120 --> 08:49.724
in his family--
but Jeffrey Grant

08:49.760 --> 08:51.853
is the only one
at the same school

08:51.890 --> 08:53.118
as Miss Littlejohn.

08:53.160 --> 08:54.593
Your Honor, this-this stinks.

08:54.630 --> 08:56.769
This phony DUI charge was used

08:56.800 --> 09:00.133
as an excuse to...
Counselor, this is
way past phony DUI's

09:00.170 --> 09:03.333
at this point-- I will deny
the writ of habeas corpus,

09:03.370 --> 09:05.258
and allow the
state's attorney

09:05.310 --> 09:07.938
their 48 hours
upon arrest to charge.

09:07.980 --> 09:10.972
Is the ASA charging now,
Your Honor?
No, not until we get

09:11.010 --> 09:13.069
a match on the DNA.
Then it's illegal
for them to collect

09:13.120 --> 09:15.008
and test Jeffrey's DNA.
And according to Illinois law,

09:15.050 --> 09:16.881
they can only do that
upon charges.
Not according

09:16.920 --> 09:18.888
to the Supreme Court.
In Maryland v. King...

09:18.920 --> 09:20.581
Which is a
general rule.

09:20.620 --> 09:21.985
The specific law in this state,
Your Honor,

09:22.020 --> 09:24.955
is very, very clear about that.
Okay, okay, hold on.
If you two want

09:24.990 --> 09:27.629
to debate like law students,
go do it somewhere else.

09:27.660 --> 09:30.322
For now, the kid
stays in custody.

09:30.370 --> 09:32.838
And if you want
to test his DNA,

09:32.870 --> 09:34.030
charge him.

09:34.070 --> 09:36.197
(gavelbangs)

09:37.370 --> 09:38.803
I'll call
your parents.

09:38.840 --> 09:40.808
When can I get out?
48 hours, max.

09:40.840 --> 09:42.102
Hang tight.

09:43.650 --> 09:44.947
(elevator bell dings)

09:52.790 --> 09:54.052
Oh.

09:54.090 --> 09:56.650
I...

09:56.690 --> 09:58.351
Could you...?

10:18.910 --> 10:21.140
David, hello!
What the hell
are you doing here?

10:21.180 --> 10:24.946
Answering my subpoena.
In reception; that's where
people who don't work here wait.

10:24.990 --> 10:26.412
You moved into my office
pretty quick.

10:26.450 --> 10:29.726
Yes, after I cleaned
the carpets of brimstone.
(laughs)

10:29.760 --> 10:31.955
I've hurt you, haven't I?

10:31.990 --> 10:34.254
Mrs. Florrick.
Hello.

10:34.300 --> 10:36.996
Ms. Lockhart. Hello.

10:37.030 --> 10:40.397
So... you're being sued again.

10:50.080 --> 10:51.775
I'm not sure how

10:51.810 --> 10:53.243
I can help you
if I can't...

10:53.280 --> 10:55.168
It's the Gopnik
adopﬁon.

10:55.220 --> 10:56.983
Myra Gopnik?
Yes.

10:57.020 --> 10:58.908
They lost her to
the genetic parents.

10:58.950 --> 11:01.180
They're suing us
for $6 million,

11:01.220 --> 11:03.085
saying that we
botched the adoption.

11:03.130 --> 11:06.054
You didn't find out that the
father was one-eighth Chippewa,

11:06.090 --> 11:07.921
so Indian tribal courts
held sway.

11:07.960 --> 11:09.928
No, I knew that.
You did?

11:09.970 --> 11:11.824
And did you tell the Gopniks?

11:15.440 --> 11:16.930
Hmm.

11:16.970 --> 11:19.461
It was a long time ago.
DAVID:
It was less

11:19.510 --> 11:21.239
than a year ago.
I know.

11:21.280 --> 11:22.975
But so much has happened.

11:23.010 --> 11:24.375
I've been let go.

11:24.410 --> 11:26.810
I've had my financial
requests rejected.

11:26.850 --> 11:28.317
You're gonna blackmail us
for your testimony?

11:28.350 --> 11:29.840
No, I'm just
telling the truth.

11:29.890 --> 11:32.245
It's hard to remember
when there's been

11:32.290 --> 11:34.952
_ so much tension
in my life about money.

11:34.990 --> 11:36.116
DIANE:
What tension?

11:36.160 --> 11:37.923
My capital contribution.

11:37.960 --> 11:41.726
The $150,000 I gave
Lockhart/Gardner

11:41.760 --> 11:43.990
as a first installment
when I made partner.

11:44.030 --> 11:46.089
The $150,000
that should've been

11:46.130 --> 11:47.995
returned to me
when I left.

11:48.040 --> 11:50.361
When you stole our clients.
David.

11:51.870 --> 11:54.407
(softly): You know,
sometimes I look at you

11:54.440 --> 11:56.499
and I wonder if you've changed

11:56.540 --> 11:59.202
or if you were always this way.
I had

11:59.250 --> 12:01.912
some of the best teachers
in the world.

12:01.950 --> 12:04.009
I couldn't help but change.

12:05.820 --> 12:08.015
So you will testify for us

12:08.060 --> 12:11.052
if you get your capital
contribution refunded?

12:13.030 --> 12:14.429
Yes.

12:15.960 --> 12:18.758
And what will your testimony be?

12:18.800 --> 12:20.893
The check first.

12:20.940 --> 12:23.465
Call me... when you're ready.

12:25.270 --> 12:27.135
(door opens)

12:28.210 --> 12:30.508
(door closes)
She has us.

12:42.930 --> 12:44.921
(elevator bell dings)

12:56.500 --> 12:59.435
Hi. Are you here
to look at the computers?

12:59.470 --> 13:01.472
Um, no.

13:01.510 --> 13:03.046
You're here for the law firm?

13:04.080 --> 13:05.172
Yes.

13:05.210 --> 13:07.212
Okay. Come on in.

13:11.850 --> 13:13.579
This is
Florrick-Agos?

13:13.620 --> 13:15.315
GRACE:
It's cool, huh?

13:15.360 --> 13:17.453
(heavy sigh)

13:17.490 --> 13:20.994
Yes. That's the word.

13:21.030 --> 13:23.294
(sighs): I've reviewed...
your financials,

13:23.330 --> 13:25.423
and, um, I'm sad to say
they're not good.

13:25.470 --> 13:29.395
Keep in mind
we're a new_venture._
A new venture Without offices,

13:29.440 --> 13:30.464
without paralegals,

13:30.510 --> 13:32.899
and with a high school girl
answering the door.

13:32.940 --> 13:34.976
There is no magic
in the books-- 30%

13:35.010 --> 13:38.571
of your billables are spent
reviewing depositions.

13:38.610 --> 13:40.111
This is, uh...

13:40.150 --> 13:42.209
unfortunately work
you can't bill at a premium.

13:42.250 --> 13:43.615
But we need to do it.

13:43.650 --> 13:45.481
We don't have
the manpower to delegate.
Yes.

13:45.520 --> 13:47.385
That is why I suggest Bangalore.

13:47.420 --> 13:49.183
As in India?
Yes. Law firms there

13:49.220 --> 13:51.450
will perform your
document review for pennies

13:51.490 --> 13:53.424
on the dollar.
And your markup...

13:53.460 --> 13:55.257
Zach, I'm in a meeting.

13:55.300 --> 13:57.120
Someone's ratting
your computer.

13:57.170 --> 13:58.319
What does that mean?

13:58.370 --> 13:59.860
ZACH :
Remote Access Tool.

13:59.900 --> 14:01.936
RAT. The hacker
infects

14:01.970 --> 14:03.938
your computer with it,
and they can use

14:03.970 --> 14:05.267
your Webcam
to spy on you.

14:05.310 --> 14:07.175
Is someone doing that
with my computer?

14:07.210 --> 14:08.939
Yeah. I came in here,
the Webcam light was on,

14:08.980 --> 14:10.208
and then it shut
off by itself.

14:10.250 --> 14:11.399
VVhen?
Couple hours ago.

14:11.450 --> 14:13.577
Is there anyone that
would want to be able

14:13.620 --> 14:16.145
to access your Webcam?

14:18.220 --> 14:20.017
Why are you out here?

14:20.060 --> 14:21.482
My computer's
been hacked.

14:21.520 --> 14:22.657
By who?

14:22.690 --> 14:24.419
Do you think
they'd do it?

14:24.460 --> 14:27.327
I think Diane wouldn't.
David Lee might.

14:27.360 --> 14:29.624
I was over there today;
they're pretty angry.

14:29.660 --> 14:32.936
I know a virus expert
who can take care of this.
No, no, let's...

14:32.970 --> 14:34.096
let's use it.

14:34.140 --> 14:36.597
Give them false information?
About clients

14:36.640 --> 14:39.438
we've signed.
Clients who are thinking
of leaving them.

14:39.470 --> 14:42.132
Make them chase their tails.
You know you're
running a firm here,

14:42.180 --> 14:43.442
not a children's game.

14:45.650 --> 14:48.073
(indistinct chatter)

14:48.120 --> 14:50.987
(buzzer sounds)

14:51.020 --> 14:53.011
JEFFREY:
I don't know her.

14:53.060 --> 14:55.358
I never met her. I know
that she's at the same school,

14:55.390 --> 14:57.688
but I-I...
it's a big school.
Now, Dani was found

14:57.730 --> 14:59.083
_with ketamine
in her system...

14:59.130 --> 15:00.950
I told you,
I never met her.

15:01.000 --> 15:03.628
And I don't do drugs,
I-I don't sell them.
It's fine, Jeffrey.

15:03.670 --> 15:05.365
We're just going
through the facts here.

15:05.400 --> 15:07.231
Now, the original
suspect from last year,

15:07.270 --> 15:09.135
the professor they arrested,
did you know him?

15:09.170 --> 15:11.365
Dr. DeLaney, yeah.
I was in his statistics class.

15:11.410 --> 15:13.935
But she wasn't in it.
Yes, but this
Dr. DeLaney,

15:13.980 --> 15:15.436
he was having
an affair with Dani?

15:15.480 --> 15:16.538
That was the rumor.

15:16.580 --> 15:18.241
Okay, I'll look into it.

15:18.280 --> 15:20.475
And_we'll have
to get into the DNA.
It's not mine.

15:20.520 --> 15:22.476
It can't be my skin
under her nails.

15:22.520 --> 15:25.216
WILL: We know, Jeffrey,
but we attack this case
from all sides.

15:25.250 --> 15:26.956
It's smart for us to do that...

15:26.990 --> 15:28.719
KALINDA: So tell me
about your family.

15:28.760 --> 15:30.284
The men in your family.
They have nothing

15:30.330 --> 15:33.049
to do with this.
DIANE: Jeffrey,
familial DNA means

15:33.100 --> 15:36.228
they found DNA they can trace
to someone in your family.

15:36.260 --> 15:38.524
Your family is
originally from
New York, isn't it?

15:38.570 --> 15:41.198
Does anybody else
live here but you
and your dad?

15:43.340 --> 15:45.604
My sister.
No, it has to be a man.

15:45.640 --> 15:47.699
Did anybody visit
you at school?

15:48.710 --> 15:50.439
My Uncle Jim.

15:50.480 --> 15:53.142
He dropped by
last year for help
on his computer.

15:53.180 --> 15:54.545
I don't want to get
anybody in trouble.

15:54.580 --> 15:58.209
You're not. We just need
to get a feel of the case.

16:02.320 --> 16:04.424
I, uh, got permission

16:04.460 --> 16:06.519
for you to use your textbooks.

16:06.560 --> 16:08.323
Thanks.
Got final exams next week.

16:08.360 --> 16:11.466
Seems like you're really
interested in Italy.
Yeah, I got

16:11.500 --> 16:12.797
an internship in Rome next year.

16:12.830 --> 16:16.698
Ah. I went backpacking
there after college.
Yeah? Did you like it?

16:16.740 --> 16:18.708
Oh, yeah.
I always wanted to go back,

16:18.740 --> 16:20.708
but never got the chance--
just too busy.
I...

16:20.740 --> 16:24.141
have never been out
of the country.
Hm.

16:24.180 --> 16:25.670
Do you think I'll get bail?

16:25.710 --> 16:26.745
We'll do our best.

16:26.780 --> 16:28.338
Sit tight, study.

16:28.380 --> 16:29.779
Think about those finals.

16:29.820 --> 16:31.617
And I'll see you later, okay?

16:31.650 --> 16:33.413
Yeah.

16:33.460 --> 16:35.155
(buzzer sounds)

16:36.190 --> 16:37.555
He did it.

16:37.590 --> 16:39.729
No. He's just nervous.

16:39.760 --> 16:41.227
No, he did it.

16:41.260 --> 16:43.069
DIANE: Ithink
he did something.

16:43.100 --> 16:44.727
Maybe had a fight with her.
Well,

16:44.770 --> 16:47.489
we need to stop them
from charging him
and testing that DNA.

16:49.240 --> 16:50.400
Where_are
you g0ing?

16:50.440 --> 16:51.737
You don't want to know.

16:51.770 --> 16:53.601
Oh. She's gonna help us?

16:53.640 --> 16:54.777
Yep.

16:54.810 --> 16:57.040
It's amazing what money will do.

17:00.120 --> 17:01.439
Well,

17:01.480 --> 17:03.243
hello again.
Hello.

17:03.290 --> 17:04.814
How are the Isenstadts?

17:04.850 --> 17:06.249
Unhappy.

17:06.290 --> 17:07.814
I'm sorry.

17:07.860 --> 17:09.509
Me, too. And yet

17:09.560 --> 17:11.289
here we are with
more human suffering.

17:11.330 --> 17:12.581
DAVID: Can we
get started,

17:12.630 --> 17:14.393
or did you both
want to play cards?

17:14.430 --> 17:15.624
DIANE:_
My apologies.

17:15.660 --> 17:17.218
(clears throat softly)

17:17.270 --> 17:19.329
I had a real case to deal with.

17:19.370 --> 17:21.497
Well, let's see
if we can turn this

17:21.540 --> 17:23.508
into a real case for you.

17:23.540 --> 17:26.338
How long did you work
on the Gopnik adoption,

17:26.370 --> 17:28.406
Mrs. Florrick?
About four months.

17:28.440 --> 17:30.408
Were you the
supervising attorney?

17:30.450 --> 17:32.406
I did the day-to-day management.

17:32.450 --> 17:34.270
I looked at some
of the documents

17:34.320 --> 17:36.072
the younger
associates drew up.

17:36.120 --> 17:37.678
Which documents?
Which associates?

17:37.720 --> 17:39.779
I believe
John Gaultner drafted

17:39.820 --> 17:41.708
the initial inquiry letter.

17:41.760 --> 17:44.126
Anthony Wright Edelman

17:44.160 --> 17:47.220
did the Gopniks'
eligibility application, but...

17:47.260 --> 17:48.557
really it was just
shuffling paper.

17:48.600 --> 17:52.718
Mr. Lee was the partner
supervising the case overall.

17:52.770 --> 17:55.659
And were you aware
that the genetic father

17:55.700 --> 17:58.567
of the adoptee
was part Chippewa Indian?
I was.

17:58.610 --> 18:00.407
Or, to be more accurate...

18:00.440 --> 18:02.408
I became aware of that.
Good.

18:02.440 --> 18:04.101
Accuracy is our friend.

18:04.150 --> 18:06.675
And were you also
aware-- or...

18:06.710 --> 18:09.611
became aware-- that because of
the child's Chippewa heritage,

18:09.650 --> 18:11.811
the tribe had an absolute right

18:11.850 --> 18:13.818
to block this
adopﬁon?
I was,

18:13.860 --> 18:15.714
and I became aware of this.

18:15.760 --> 18:17.421
So given this
awareness,

18:17.460 --> 18:18.620
how could you in good conscience

18:18.660 --> 18:21.356
allow the Gopniks
to proceed down this path?
Because I

18:21.400 --> 18:23.391
told them of this possibility
and they wanted

18:23.430 --> 18:26.228
to go fonNard
with the adoption.
Are you sure of that?

18:26.270 --> 18:27.828
DIANE: Mrs. Florrick
testified to the fact,

18:27.870 --> 18:29.269
therefore she's sure of it.
Excuse me,

18:29.300 --> 18:30.460
my understanding is that

18:30.510 --> 18:32.466
you have since left
Lockhart/Gardner,

18:32.510 --> 18:34.876
Mrs. Florrick, and therefore...

18:34.910 --> 18:36.377
Oh... wait,

18:36.410 --> 18:38.139
did I say "left"? I...

18:38.180 --> 18:40.319
I think the word I
was looking f-for was

18:40.350 --> 18:41.908
"fired."

18:41.950 --> 18:44.885
When I left, Mr. Schmidt,
I was a partner.

18:44.920 --> 18:46.842
I couldn't be fired.
My mistake.

18:46.890 --> 18:49.518
I just thought
you would welcome
this moment to be

18:49.560 --> 18:51.824
more forthcoming
about those who--

18:51.860 --> 18:54.522
(sighs) oh, what is
the best word here?--

18:54.560 --> 18:56.619
"pushed you
out of their law firm."

18:56.660 --> 19:00.266
There must be a...
German word to that effect.

19:00.300 --> 19:01.597
Gesundschrumpfen.

19:01.640 --> 19:03.938
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Now, I believe

19:03.970 --> 19:06.768
that Mrs. Florrick has addressed
the basis for her subpoena,

19:06.810 --> 19:08.630
so if there's nothing else...
Mrs. Florrick,
could you

19:08.680 --> 19:09.738
please tell me

19:09.780 --> 19:11.702
what this is?

19:11.750 --> 19:13.479
It's a check

19:13.520 --> 19:17.217
for $10,000, drawn
on the Lockhart/Gardner
bank account, made out

19:17.250 --> 19:18.888
to the Chippewa Nation.
Do you know what

19:18.920 --> 19:20.410
this check was for?
I have no idea.

19:20.460 --> 19:22.212
I've never seen it before.
Would it surprise you

19:22.260 --> 19:23.522
to learn this was a bribe

19:23.560 --> 19:25.380
intended to
convince the tribe

19:25.430 --> 19:27.352
not to object to the adoption.

19:27.400 --> 19:30.392
I object to this whole line
of questioning as defamatory.

19:30.430 --> 19:31.897
And your objection
is preserved for the record.

19:31.930 --> 19:33.761
Would it also
surprise you to learn

19:33.800 --> 19:35.563
that in an afﬁdavit,

19:35.600 --> 19:37.807
Chief Joshua Proudfoot--
one word--

19:37.840 --> 19:39.535
of the Chippewa
Nation asserts

19:39.570 --> 19:42.937
this check turned the tribe
against the adoption?

19:46.410 --> 19:49.516
I can only say that if
the facts you relate are true

19:49.550 --> 19:50.778
then it does surprise me.
This was

19:50.820 --> 19:52.549
a case you were,
in your words,

19:52.590 --> 19:54.512
performing the day-to-day
management on.

19:54.560 --> 19:56.380
Mr. Schmidt, she answered
your question.
I just thought

19:56.420 --> 19:58.650
Alicia would jump at the chance
to assign responsibility

19:58.690 --> 20:02.399
to the firm that fired her.

20:02.430 --> 20:03.966
Alicia?

20:07.840 --> 20:09.796
No, I'm good.

20:09.840 --> 20:11.637
And have them test
the audio beforehand.

20:11.670 --> 20:14.309
Last time I lectured there
I sounded like Lou Gehrig.

20:14.340 --> 20:15.375
Professor DeLaney?

20:15.410 --> 20:16.308
Yeah, may I help you?

20:16.340 --> 20:18.376
Will Gardner. I left
you a couple messages

20:18.410 --> 20:20.469
about Dani Littlejohn.

20:20.520 --> 20:22.613
Please, an innocent kid
could be going to prison.

20:22.650 --> 20:25.483
Look, I have nothing to offer;
I was cleared of Dani's murder.

20:25.520 --> 20:26.589
Now, leave me alone.

20:26.620 --> 20:28.781
Hey, I know you.

20:28.820 --> 20:29.957
Owen?
Yeah.

20:29.990 --> 20:32.754
Well, Dr. Cavanaugh.
You're Alicia's boss

20:32.790 --> 20:34.621
from her work, Will.
You teach here?

20:34.660 --> 20:36.389
I do. Yeah,
mathematical sciences.

20:36.430 --> 20:38.466
Professor of the
month, actually.

20:38.500 --> 20:41.628
I get all the frozen yogurt
I want from YouGoGurt.

20:41.670 --> 20:42.932
How's Alicia doing?

20:43.970 --> 20:45.767
You haven't spoken
to her recently?

20:45.810 --> 20:47.630
I haven't, no.
Why? Is everything okay?

20:47.680 --> 20:48.908
I-I think so.

20:48.940 --> 20:50.578
So, do you know Dr. DeLaney?

20:50.610 --> 20:52.771
I do, yeah. Why?

20:52.810 --> 20:54.414
This is pretty good.
You want another?

20:54.450 --> 20:55.815
'Cause I got, like, a lot.

20:55.850 --> 20:57.317
(laughs):
No, thanks.

20:57.350 --> 20:59.284
So, the cops
suspected, uh,

20:59.320 --> 21:01.015
Dr. DeLaney was
sleeping with Dani?

21:01.060 --> 21:03.585
Yeah. I mean,
I heard that, too.

21:03.630 --> 21:06.519
DeLaney was going through
a divorce at the time,

21:06.560 --> 21:09.620
and, um, there were
rumors of the...

21:09.660 --> 21:11.992
Oh, uh, you don't want
to hear rumors.

21:12.030 --> 21:14.339
I do.
Well...

21:14.370 --> 21:15.860
he had the "B-plus club."

21:15.900 --> 21:18.334
Any student who did
a B-plus or better

21:18.370 --> 21:20.509
got invited back
to his house for dinner,

21:20.540 --> 21:22.701
and there were rumors--
and, again, I stress

21:22.740 --> 21:25.777
they're only rumors--
that the kids would use it

21:25.810 --> 21:28.847
to hook up,
and he would encourage it.

21:28.880 --> 21:31.587
Do you know a student
named Jeffrey Grant?

21:31.620 --> 21:33.679
I do, yeah. Nice kid. Why?
We he a part

21:33.720 --> 21:36.814
of this B-plus club?
Oh, I think so.
I mean, he was a good student.

21:36.860 --> 21:38.680
And Dani Littlejohn was, too?

21:38.730 --> 21:40.550
Mm-hmm.

21:40.600 --> 21:42.420
That's how
Dr. DeLaney became

21:42.460 --> 21:44.792
close with her.

21:44.830 --> 21:47.025
Ooh, it's gossip.
This is professor gossip.

21:47.070 --> 21:48.935
It's-it's the worst kind.

21:48.970 --> 21:50.665
How's Alicia doing?

21:53.880 --> 21:56.075
I don't know, Owen.

21:56.110 --> 21:57.941
She's no longer at my firm.

21:57.980 --> 22:00.619
What?

22:00.650 --> 22:01.947
Why?

22:01.980 --> 22:03.049
She left.

22:03.080 --> 22:04.786
To start her own firm.

22:04.820 --> 22:06.583
VVhen?
Three weeks ago.

22:06.620 --> 22:08.656
Oh, my God. What...

22:10.830 --> 22:12.559
What happened?

22:15.760 --> 22:17.728
I have no idea.

22:17.770 --> 22:19.499
(knocking)

22:20.500 --> 22:21.660
Yes?

22:21.700 --> 22:23.406
Are you Jim Grant?

22:23.440 --> 22:25.567
If this is about
the lawn ornaments,

22:25.610 --> 22:27.009
I stopped marketing them

22:27.040 --> 22:28.769
online six months ago.

22:28.810 --> 22:30.778
Are you Jeffrey
Grant's uncle?

22:30.810 --> 22:32.573
Why? Is he all right?

22:32.610 --> 22:34.919
You visited him recently
at college, right?

22:34.950 --> 22:37.009
Who are you?

22:37.050 --> 22:38.608
Kalinda.

22:38.650 --> 22:40.413
How did you meet
Dani Littlejohn?

22:40.460 --> 22:43.088
I have no idea what
you're talking about.
Then how did

22:43.120 --> 22:45.486
your DNA end up under
her fingernails?

22:45.530 --> 22:48.499
They found DNA from a
male relation of Jeffrey

22:48.530 --> 22:52.125
under Dani's fingernails, and
you're the only male relative

22:52.170 --> 22:53.899
who visited the
college, so...

22:53.940 --> 22:55.760
when did you meet her?

22:55.800 --> 22:58.667
The DNA is male, right?

22:58.710 --> 23:01.133
That's why you're looking
for a male relation?

23:01.180 --> 23:02.477
Yeah.

23:02.510 --> 23:04.944
Uh, wait just a moment.

23:11.490 --> 23:14.084
This is me.

23:14.120 --> 23:15.883
Pre-op.

23:15.920 --> 23:18.457
That's right.
My nephew doesn't know.

23:18.490 --> 23:20.924
That was 20 years ago.

23:20.960 --> 23:22.825
I've always been
Uncle Jim to him.

23:24.670 --> 23:26.661
Thanks.

23:26.700 --> 23:30.090
You know, there's something
else Jeffrey didn't know.

23:30.140 --> 23:32.563
He has a half brother.

23:36.580 --> 23:39.469
No, you know who I've been
getting interest from?

23:39.510 --> 23:41.444
The Paisley Group.

23:41.480 --> 23:43.948
You mean Diane's
top client?

23:43.990 --> 23:46.015
Y... Yeah, yeah,

23:46.050 --> 23:48.814
they, uh, they're
not happy with her
representation.

23:48.860 --> 23:51.055
Make sure they
keep it secret

23:51.090 --> 23:54.457
(phone rings)
from Lockhart/Gardner.

23:54.500 --> 23:56.695
(both mouthing)
ALICIA: Hello, David.
I'm not returning

23:56.730 --> 23:59.164
the capital contribution;
I already cashed it.

23:59.200 --> 24:01.191
Well, you may not
want to spend it yet,

24:01.240 --> 24:03.060
because you're gonna
need to come up

24:03.100 --> 24:04.761
with $6 million.

24:04.810 --> 24:06.038
Why, are you gonna
countersue me?

24:06.070 --> 24:07.833
No. We went over
the billing records

24:07.880 --> 24:10.974
after your wonderful deposition
performance, and guess what?

24:11.010 --> 24:13.717
Smack in the middle
of the adoption proceedings,

24:13.750 --> 24:15.775
you were promoted to partner.

24:16.980 --> 24:18.049
No.

24:18.090 --> 24:22.959
Yes. So partner plus
day-to-day management of a case

24:22.990 --> 24:25.527
equals supervisory authority.

24:25.560 --> 24:29.849
Call it a perk of leadership,
but you're personally liable...

24:29.900 --> 24:33.597
for the whole $6 million.

24:40.140 --> 24:43.007
(excited chatter)
It's my issue. Wait.

24:43.040 --> 24:44.940
(chatter stops abruptly)
It's not a Florrick-Agos issue.

24:44.980 --> 24:46.675
It's mine.
No, it's all of ours.

24:46.710 --> 24:49.110
If they come after you,
they come after all of us.

24:49.150 --> 24:51.118
Thanks. But I...
CARY:
No buts.

24:51.150 --> 24:52.788
You'd do the same for us.

24:52.820 --> 24:54.913
CLARKE:
I don't understand.

24:54.960 --> 24:58.259
They're countersuing you?
They're saying that

24:58.290 --> 25:00.895
since I became a partner
while that case was pending,

25:00.930 --> 25:02.989
I'm responsible for everything
that happened on it,

25:03.030 --> 25:04.258
including the bribe.

25:04.300 --> 25:05.995
So if the Gopniks win,

25:06.030 --> 25:08.760
I'm personally liable
for the full $6 million.

25:08.800 --> 25:10.802
(doorbell rings)
ALICIA:
I'll get it!

25:13.710 --> 25:16.531
I need a lawyer.
You know where I can find one?

25:16.580 --> 25:18.275
(laughs)

25:18.310 --> 25:19.868
Oh, wow.

25:19.910 --> 25:22.276
Feels like somebody needs
some loving in their life.

25:22.320 --> 25:24.015
Who told you?

25:24.050 --> 25:25.278
Who told me what?

25:25.320 --> 25:27.652
I'm starting my own firm. Mom?

25:27.690 --> 25:28.987
No.

25:29.020 --> 25:30.681
Actually, um...

25:30.730 --> 25:33.551
(clicks tongue)
oddly...

25:33.600 --> 25:35.818
Can we sit down?

25:35.860 --> 25:36.895
Why?

25:36.930 --> 25:38.227
Oh, because...

25:38.270 --> 25:40.898
Oh, wow, you really are
trying to do this

25:40.940 --> 25:42.293
from your living room.

25:42.340 --> 25:43.364
It's temporary.

25:43.400 --> 25:47.200
So... (groans) who told you
I left Lockhart/Gardner?

25:47.240 --> 25:49.299
Oddly enough, it was Will.

25:49.340 --> 25:51.046
He... what?

25:51.080 --> 25:53.913
Um, I don't un... he...
What... when...

25:53.950 --> 25:56.919
Oh, this is very entertaining,
watching you flail.

25:56.950 --> 25:58.941
Well, he...

25:58.990 --> 26:00.912
(exhale)
Did Will talk to you?

26:00.960 --> 26:02.985
Yeah, he was at my
college on a case,

26:03.020 --> 26:04.920
and I bumped into him.

26:04.960 --> 26:06.279
He-he didn't
say anything.

26:06.330 --> 26:07.991
It was only after
I pushed him.

26:08.030 --> 26:09.793
Okay. Good to know.

26:09.830 --> 26:11.718
So, why didn't you tell
me you were leaving?

26:11.770 --> 26:14.068
I was pushed out, Owen.
I didn't have time.

26:14.100 --> 26:16.591
Will pushed me out.
Because you were
thinking of leaving

26:16.640 --> 26:18.039
and taking some of his clients?

26:18.070 --> 26:20.231
Did he tell you that?

26:20.270 --> 26:24.047
No, no, I'm just reading
your body language here,

26:24.080 --> 26:26.207
and you're in, like,
warrior-princess mode.

26:26.250 --> 26:28.115
Well, I'm kicking butt.

26:28.150 --> 26:30.243
Yeah, I can
see that.

26:30.280 --> 26:33.249
I also know why you left,
and that it has nothing to do

26:33.290 --> 26:34.757
with starting your own firm.

26:34.790 --> 26:36.212
Oh, Owen,
can we not do this now?

26:36.260 --> 26:38.057
What? You were afraid
of getting close to Will.

26:38.090 --> 26:39.352
Hey. Do you want
something to eat?

26:39.390 --> 26:41.221
Will you admit it?
You were afraid

26:41.260 --> 26:42.693
of leaving
your marriage for Will,

26:42.730 --> 26:44.891
so this is like
the nuclear bomb...

26:44.930 --> 26:46.363
Oh, hey, Grace.

26:46.400 --> 26:47.264
Hey, what's up?

26:47.300 --> 26:48.961
Nothing. Just visiting
your lovely mother

26:49.000 --> 26:50.661
at her new law firm.

26:50.710 --> 26:52.200
Have you seen Zach, Mom?

26:52.240 --> 26:54.037
ZACH:
What?

26:54.080 --> 26:57.607
Could you... There's...
there's something.

27:03.990 --> 27:05.810
What's wrong?
What...

27:11.390 --> 27:13.927
(quietly):
VVhen?

27:13.960 --> 27:15.996
About five minutes ago.

27:25.040 --> 27:27.907
Is there something else,
Mr. Hayden?

27:30.140 --> 27:32.142
(sighs)

27:32.180 --> 27:33.738
There is.

27:33.780 --> 27:36.271
Ithink... Ithink
Bangalore, it'll work.

27:36.320 --> 27:37.719
Yes.

27:37.750 --> 27:39.445
No, it's about
Mrs. Florrick's lawsuit.

27:39.490 --> 27:41.378
Do you know something?

27:41.420 --> 27:43.058
I worked with
the books

27:43.090 --> 27:44.921
at Lockhart/Gardner.

27:44.960 --> 27:46.655
I know everything.

27:48.160 --> 27:50.765
Alicia.
DAVID:
So, what special entertainment

27:50.800 --> 27:52.427
do you have for me
this round?

27:52.470 --> 27:54.392
Mr. Lee, always
a pleasure.

27:54.440 --> 27:56.032
Why don't you give up

27:56.070 --> 27:57.469
on this suit? _
You're never gonna Win.

27:57.500 --> 27:59.331
I like suits I can't win.

27:59.370 --> 28:00.837
They clarify the mind.

28:00.880 --> 28:03.178
Well, let's go
do some clarifying.

28:03.210 --> 28:04.848
One second.

28:04.880 --> 28:06.768
Just... waiting
for my next witness.

28:06.810 --> 28:08.209
(elevator bell dings)

28:10.120 --> 28:13.180
Mr. Hayden.
Thank you for doing this.

28:13.220 --> 28:16.087
Mr. Lee.
Good to see you again.

28:16.120 --> 28:19.419
SCHMIDT:
And how do you know this, sir?

28:19.460 --> 28:22.156
I was the bankruptcy trustee
for Lockhart/Gardner

28:22.200 --> 28:23.861
at the time
of these events.

28:23.900 --> 28:26.368
Judas.
SCHMIDT:
Did you get that?

28:26.400 --> 28:29.267
Mr. Lee, in a clumsy attempt
at intimidation,

28:29.300 --> 28:31.803
Objection.
might have said
it too quietly.

28:31.840 --> 28:33.137
'Uudasf

28:33.170 --> 28:37.300
As in Judas Iscariot,
the betrayer of Christ.

28:37.340 --> 28:39.376
And so you were privy

28:39.410 --> 28:40.809
to Lockhart/Gardner's books?

28:40.850 --> 28:42.215
Yes.
Mr. Hayden, much
of this information

28:42.250 --> 28:44.343
is privileged.
Not this information, ma'am.

28:44.390 --> 28:47.314
SCHMIDT:
Lockhart/Gardner
is contending that
Alicia Florrick was

28:47.350 --> 28:49.818
the supervisor
at the time of this bribe

28:49.860 --> 28:51.418
to the Indian council.

28:51.460 --> 28:53.348
Is that correct?
No.

28:53.390 --> 28:56.359
In October, I recommended
to Ms. Lockhart and Mr. Gardner

28:56.400 --> 28:59.961
that they dedicate more
partner hours to cases.

29:00.000 --> 29:03.060
And David Lee was assigned
as the lawyer of record.

29:03.100 --> 29:05.967
SCHMIDT:
Which means he was

29:06.010 --> 29:07.898
legally responsible
for supervising?

29:07.940 --> 29:10.841
And personally liable here.

29:10.880 --> 29:12.905
SCHMIDT:
Looks like it's

29:12.950 --> 29:14.019
back in your court.

29:18.050 --> 29:19.244
Yeah, Kalinda, what's up?

29:19.290 --> 29:20.746
I found his half brother.

29:20.790 --> 29:24.385
You did? Great.
Yeah. I don't think he'll
let me cotton-swab his mouth,

29:24.430 --> 29:26.785
but I'll see what I can get.

29:26.830 --> 29:27.899
Hey.

29:29.400 --> 29:32.096
Office is up front if you
want to place an order.
Actually,

29:32.130 --> 29:33.995
I'm here to talk to you.

29:34.040 --> 29:37.134
You're... Anderson
Prickett, right?

29:37.170 --> 29:38.865
(spits)

29:38.910 --> 29:40.901
And you are?
Kalinda Sharma.

29:40.940 --> 29:42.908
I'm investigating
working conditions

29:42.940 --> 29:44.578
at companies in the area.

29:44.610 --> 29:46.271
Look, uh...

29:46.310 --> 29:48.073
I just want to
make sure that

29:48.120 --> 29:50.076
management isn't
harassing you.

29:50.120 --> 29:51.417
Harassing me for...?

29:51.450 --> 29:53.816
Your arrest last
year, for one.

29:53.860 --> 29:54.918
You were busted dealing
ketamine, right?

29:54.960 --> 29:58.020
You with the Labor Board?
Also trying
to make sure

29:58.060 --> 30:00.426
that workers aren't getting
their pay docked for sick days.

30:00.460 --> 30:03.554
Your manager said you
called in sick last year

30:03.600 --> 30:05.966
on the 15th of August.

30:06.000 --> 30:07.558
Where were you?

30:22.080 --> 30:24.310
*

30:36.600 --> 30:38.397
(keyboard tapping)

30:57.050 --> 30:59.041
*

31:24.510 --> 31:28.514
What are you doing?

31:28.550 --> 31:29.869
SCHMIDT:
So you acknowledge

31:29.920 --> 31:33.185
bringing the Gopnik
adoption case in the door?
Well, I'm not sure

31:33.220 --> 31:34.414
what you mean by "in the door."

31:34.460 --> 31:36.109
Mr. Lee, I've got
Mrs. Florrick

31:36.160 --> 31:37.457
outside ready to
be re-deposed,

31:37.490 --> 31:40.425
so can we
handle this CIVIlly?

31:40.460 --> 31:42.189
I brought in
the business.

31:45.200 --> 31:47.498
SCHMIDT:
So, the $10,000 that was sent
to the reservation...

31:47.530 --> 31:50.260
DAVID:
I've already said
it didn't come from me.

31:50.300 --> 31:53.007
But I know
who sent it.

31:53.040 --> 31:55.270
SCHMIDT:
You do? And who might that be?

31:55.310 --> 31:56.629
WILL:
The brother looks good for this.

31:56.680 --> 31:58.272
And the gum?

31:58.310 --> 31:59.971
That's not something
they can ignore.

32:00.010 --> 32:01.477
Absolutely.
It's already over there.

32:01.520 --> 32:03.988
Geneva know.

32:04.020 --> 32:05.988
They're checking the DNA.
20 hours to go.

32:06.020 --> 32:07.578
I'll talk to you.

32:24.070 --> 32:25.662
(door opens)
DAVID:
I didn't supervise him.

32:25.710 --> 32:28.201
SCHMIDT:
And who is this person,
this Anthony Wright Edelman?

32:28.240 --> 32:29.969
DAVID:
Oh, one of these little idiots

32:30.010 --> 32:32.069
who left with Alicia--
the Indian kid.

32:32.110 --> 32:34.214
SCHMIDT:
And you're saying
he sent out the bribe

32:34.250 --> 32:38.038
to the Chippewa council?
_DAVID: _
I'm swearing he sent it out.

32:38.090 --> 32:41.719
SCHMIDT:
How very convenient for you,
given that Alicia superv...

32:41.760 --> 32:44.183
EDELMAN:
Yes, I offered

32:44.230 --> 32:46.289
the tribe cash
to sign off on the adoption.

32:46.330 --> 32:47.319
What were you thinking?

32:47.360 --> 32:48.657
I was thinking I wanted to win.

32:48.700 --> 32:51.123
You lost their adoption.
Their adoption
was lost.

32:51.170 --> 32:52.694
I was making a last-ditch...
CAREY:
You just

32:52.730 --> 32:54.061
screwed over Alicia.
Wait.

32:54.100 --> 32:55.431
Did you consult
with David Lee

32:55.470 --> 32:56.767
before you sent
out the check?

32:56.800 --> 32:59.234
No.
Did you consult
with anyone else?

32:59.270 --> 33:01.238
Any partner?

33:01.280 --> 33:02.770
Howard Lyman.

33:02.810 --> 33:05.199
You consulted
with Howard Lyman?

33:05.250 --> 33:08.048
And he approved?
He did.

33:08.080 --> 33:09.479
Well, we need
to get you deposed.

33:09.520 --> 33:11.249
Call Carter Schmidt.
GRACE:
Zach, It's on!

33:11.290 --> 33:14.589
What's wrong?
Nothing. Just
something for Zach.

33:14.620 --> 33:16.656
Yeah, we have to do
some stuff for school,
Mom-- on the computer.

33:16.690 --> 33:19.329
GRACE:
It just came on a second ago.

33:21.400 --> 33:23.618
(whispering): Okay,
so, once we go in,

33:23.660 --> 33:25.594
just start undressing,
all right?
What?

33:25.630 --> 33:26.927
Just take off your sweater
or something, all right?

33:26.970 --> 33:30.098
You need to keep
the hacker online long
enough for us to trace him.

33:30.140 --> 33:32.005
Oh...

33:35.810 --> 33:37.209
How you doing, Will?

33:37.240 --> 33:38.070
You know you have

33:38.110 --> 33:39.646
five hours left
to charge or release.

33:39.680 --> 33:41.318
I did know that.
But I thought

33:41.350 --> 33:42.772
we'd sit down together
and see if

33:42.820 --> 33:43.878
maybe we could work out a deal.

33:43.920 --> 33:47.219
They can't make their case.
They want to bargain.

33:47.250 --> 33:49.389
Sure, Geneva.
So, you tested

33:49.420 --> 33:50.682
the DNA
from the ketamine-dealing

33:50.720 --> 33:52.324
half brother,
didn't you? The gum?

33:52.360 --> 33:53.657
This isn't about the DNA.

33:53.690 --> 33:55.328
It is about saving the state

33:55.360 --> 33:57.294
a costly
and time-consuming trial.

33:59.630 --> 34:00.767
See you in
a half hour.

34:00.800 --> 34:02.358
Good-bye.

34:02.400 --> 34:04.504
Get a good deal.

34:06.370 --> 34:08.338
Owen? Hi.
What are you...

34:08.380 --> 34:10.200
I-I just need
a minute, Will.

34:10.240 --> 34:12.071
Okay. Um, we're not looking

34:12.110 --> 34:14.249
at Dr. DeLaney
as a suspect anymore.
No,

34:14.280 --> 34:16.441
I'm... I'm here
about Alicia.

34:17.850 --> 34:20.717
I'm sorry, I can't
do this right now.
Alicia was afraid

34:20.750 --> 34:22.479
of falling in
love with you.

34:22.520 --> 34:25.785
That's why she left.
It's okay.
Everything's fine.

34:25.830 --> 34:28.094
It's... clearly not fine.

34:28.130 --> 34:29.324
(elevator bell dings)

34:29.360 --> 34:31.362
I want my sister
to be happy.

34:35.470 --> 34:38.735
You really think she was
itching to start her own firm?

34:38.770 --> 34:41.773
She and her partners
are reusing paper clips.

34:41.810 --> 34:45.200
Alicia was afraid
to work beside you.

34:45.250 --> 34:46.342
That's all.

34:46.380 --> 34:47.301
It was easier
to start hating you

34:47.350 --> 34:49.671
than to own the feelings
she had toward you.

34:49.720 --> 34:52.439
That's why you two
are in this-this...

34:52.490 --> 34:55.584
ridiculous war.
(elevator bell dings)

34:57.590 --> 34:59.387
She and Peter,

34:59.430 --> 35:01.751
they're not
set in stone.

35:07.670 --> 35:09.490
It's over.

35:09.540 --> 35:11.303
Good-bye.

35:15.480 --> 35:18.176
*

35:18.210 --> 35:20.201
Stiles.

35:20.250 --> 35:22.468
Hey. Did you see what
Colin's sending around?

35:22.520 --> 35:23.669
It's nasty.

35:26.750 --> 35:29.184
What the hell?
What are you doing?

35:29.220 --> 35:31.859
Stop ratting my sister.
You hear me?

35:31.890 --> 35:34.723
Hey, I-I-I don't... I don't
know what you're talking about.
My sister.

35:34.760 --> 35:36.159
Stop it.

35:37.660 --> 35:39.560
(grunting)

35:44.640 --> 35:46.608
(Stiles groaning)

35:50.740 --> 35:53.573
*

36:03.720 --> 36:05.927
Jeffrey, this
is good news.

36:05.960 --> 36:07.029
They want a plea bargain.

36:07.060 --> 36:10.359
That means their evidence
might not be lining up.

36:10.400 --> 36:12.459
I'm scared.
I know. It's okay.

36:12.500 --> 36:15.663
They want to keep you scared
so you take a bad deal.

36:15.700 --> 36:17.531
You keep a poker face.

36:17.570 --> 36:19.265
Just listen, nod,

36:19.310 --> 36:21.278
and we'll talk
afterwards, okay?

36:21.310 --> 36:22.937
GENEVA:
Involuntary manslaughter.

36:22.980 --> 36:24.402
Two years.

36:24.450 --> 36:25.644
Okay, we'll think
about it.

36:25.680 --> 36:27.978
It's either that
or life in prison, Jeff.

36:28.010 --> 36:30.319
You're 22 years old.
Think about that future.
WILL: Thanks, Geneva.

36:30.350 --> 36:31.419
We'll consider it.
You want

36:31.450 --> 36:33.338
to see Italy at some
point in your life,

36:33.390 --> 36:34.482
take this deal.

36:34.520 --> 36:36.715
Time to let us
talk, Geneva.

36:42.000 --> 36:43.592
(buzzer sounds)

36:46.930 --> 36:48.932
(door clanks shut)

36:53.310 --> 36:54.470
(sighs)

36:54.510 --> 36:56.569
Did you kill Dani Littlejohn?

36:56.610 --> 36:58.271
No.

36:58.310 --> 37:00.449
Is there any way your skin
could've ended up

37:00.480 --> 37:02.641
under her fingernails?
No.

37:02.680 --> 37:06.810
You didn't know her at all,
never even met her?
Neven

37:06.850 --> 37:09.250
Then you're innocent...

37:09.290 --> 37:11.588
and you should reject this deal.

37:13.060 --> 37:14.789
Okay.
No.

37:14.830 --> 37:16.821
You have to tell me.

37:18.370 --> 37:20.691
(soft laugh)
I reject this deal.

37:22.640 --> 37:24.562
(whispers):
Good.

37:24.610 --> 37:26.703
So why do I feel so nervous?

37:29.410 --> 37:31.901
_ Because this stuff
isn't meant to be easy.

37:40.520 --> 37:43.978
So, what's this about,
a new offer?
I'll call you back.

37:44.020 --> 37:46.386
Well, not
exactly a new...

37:46.430 --> 37:49.422
Actually, yes, maybe we
should call it a new one.

37:49.460 --> 37:51.052
You should've taken
that two years.
And you should've

37:51.100 --> 37:53.022
already checked
the DNA on that gum.

37:53.070 --> 37:54.697
His half brother did it.

37:54.740 --> 37:56.469
We did check it.
It's not him.

37:56.500 --> 37:57.933
So I charged
your client

37:57.970 --> 38:01.576
with Dani Littlejohn's murder,
and I expedited his DNA.

38:01.610 --> 38:03.771
It's a hundred
percent match.

38:05.010 --> 38:06.898
Jeffrey said he
never met her,

38:06.950 --> 38:09.418
but that is his DNA
under her fingernails.

38:09.450 --> 38:10.940
He killed that girl.

38:15.820 --> 38:17.356
Sorry,

38:17.390 --> 38:19.051
you'll have to wait
for discovery.

38:24.100 --> 38:27.069
Don't be upset, Will.
Clients lie.

38:27.100 --> 38:29.796
Anthony Wright Edelman.

38:29.840 --> 38:32.934
SCHMIDT:
Mr. Edelman, were you
staffed as an associate

38:32.970 --> 38:35.530
on the adoption that is the
subject of this lawsuit?

38:35.580 --> 38:36.933
I was.

38:36.980 --> 38:39.073
And on March 6, 2013,

38:39.110 --> 38:41.670
did you send Chief
Joshua Proudfoot

38:41.720 --> 38:44.518
of the Chippewa Nation
a check for $10,000

38:44.550 --> 38:47.940
to induce the tribe not to
object to the adoption?

38:47.990 --> 38:49.855
I did.
At whose direction

38:49.890 --> 38:52.051
did you deliver this inducement?

38:52.090 --> 38:54.422
Alicia Florrick's.

38:56.430 --> 38:58.660
SCHMIDT:
Alicia Florrick?

38:58.700 --> 39:01.066
Are you sure?

39:01.100 --> 39:04.638
Yes. Mrs. Florrick told me
we had to make the payment

39:04.670 --> 39:06.638
to facilitate the adoption.

39:06.670 --> 39:09.036
What are you doing?
DIANE:
I will remind Mrs. Florrick that

39:09.080 --> 39:10.832
she is not a party
to this deposition.

39:10.880 --> 39:13.371
She's here as a courtesy.
DAVID: And if she
interrupts again,

39:13.410 --> 39:15.071
she'll be asked to leave.

39:15.120 --> 39:18.419
SCHMIDT:
So Mrs. Florrick
was the partner

39:18.450 --> 39:20.714
supervising you
on this matter?
ANTHONY:
That's correct.

39:20.750 --> 39:23.981
Were you working at any
other partner's behest?

39:24.020 --> 39:27.057
No. Just Mrs. Florrick's.

39:27.090 --> 39:30.958
You want to tell me
what that was about?

39:31.000 --> 39:33.560
Welcome back.
Thank you.

39:35.170 --> 39:36.660
Isn't it nice?

39:36.700 --> 39:38.736
We had a partnership
position open,

39:38.770 --> 39:40.101
so Anthony got it.

39:40.140 --> 39:42.608
I will file a complaint
with the ACDB.

39:42.640 --> 39:43.834
I will sue you

39:43.880 --> 39:46.940
for conspiracy.
(chuckles): You'll do
nothing but fail.

39:46.980 --> 39:50.416
Stop ratting our computers.
It's illegal.

39:50.450 --> 39:52.748
It's... What are you
talking about?
Do it again

39:52.790 --> 39:56.487
and we'll bring charges.
Sure, whatever you say.

39:56.520 --> 39:59.626
Good luck with your
firm, Mrs. Florrick.

39:59.660 --> 40:02.891
I'd start putting my
$6 million together now.

40:02.930 --> 40:04.727
I didn't lie.

40:04.770 --> 40:07.159
You only hurt yourself--
you could've had two years.
I didn't lie.

40:07.200 --> 40:09.634
I never met her.
Then how did
your DNA end up...

40:09.670 --> 40:10.932
I don't know, I...

40:10.970 --> 40:14.576
(panting):
I... I don't know.

40:18.180 --> 40:20.808
Okay. Okay,
let me see what I can do.

40:25.620 --> 40:27.884
(sighs) I'm never
getting out of here, am I?

40:27.920 --> 40:29.751
I'll ask for bail,
but I don't know.

40:29.790 --> 40:31.155
They're gonna probably
transfer you to county.

40:31.190 --> 40:33.522
And don't talk to anyone.

40:33.560 --> 40:34.993
Cellmates are prone to snitch.

40:35.030 --> 40:37.191
Oh, my God.

40:37.230 --> 40:38.788
Listen.

40:38.830 --> 40:40.718
We're going to trial.

40:40.770 --> 40:43.898
I'll try to move fast,
but it could take six months.

40:43.940 --> 40:48.104
I need you to hold
it together, okay?

40:48.140 --> 40:51.576
Jeff, look at me.

40:51.610 --> 40:53.544
Okay?

40:53.580 --> 40:55.878
I'm not giving up.

40:55.920 --> 40:57.569
Don't you give up, either.

41:03.790 --> 41:05.189
(sighs)

41:05.230 --> 41:06.379
CAREY:
Hey.

41:06.430 --> 41:09.092
We're trying to get our heads
around the Anthony thing.

41:09.130 --> 41:11.018
He blindsided all of us.
The question is,

41:11.060 --> 41:13.893
how much can he hurt us.
A lot. He'll
dish on every

41:13.930 --> 41:15.989
strategy
he was privy to.

41:18.270 --> 41:20.033
How you doing?

41:23.080 --> 41:24.900
Okay. Go ahead, Clarke.

41:24.950 --> 41:27.100
(clears throat)
Mrs. Florrick,

41:27.150 --> 41:29.971
even without office
space, you're Sinking

41:30.020 --> 41:31.749
under the cost
of overhead.

41:31.790 --> 41:32.984
Malpractice
insurance,

41:33.020 --> 41:34.510
staff salaries,
marketing costs...

41:34.560 --> 41:36.209
Your fee.
Yes. Overhead.

41:36.260 --> 41:38.979
What you need to be doing now
is billing hours--

41:39.030 --> 41:41.157
a lot of them--
and without Anthony,

41:41.190 --> 41:43.226
your manpower crisis
has worsened.

41:43.260 --> 41:44.488
He wants us to hire him.

41:44.530 --> 41:47.829
I'm a full-fledged
member of the bar
now, Mrs. Florrick,

41:47.870 --> 41:49.098
and business expertise

41:49.140 --> 41:50.869
is something
you are sorely lacking.

41:50.900 --> 41:52.868
Mr. Hayden...
Your books are
in disarray.

41:52.910 --> 41:54.969
I will get you
on your feet financially.

41:55.010 --> 41:56.568
And he'll work for free.

41:58.950 --> 42:00.269
Why?

42:00.310 --> 42:02.642
Well... I like...

42:04.050 --> 42:05.745
...the law.

42:05.790 --> 42:09.157
Now, I will only work for free
until the firm is profitable,

42:09.190 --> 42:11.055
which I will work day
and night to achieve.

42:11.090 --> 42:14.150
Once we're in the black, then
I want my salary retroactively.

42:15.830 --> 42:17.752
Thank you.
No,

42:17.800 --> 42:20.166
we'll be thanking you.

42:20.200 --> 42:21.758
Zach!

42:22.800 --> 42:24.563
Zach, what happened?

42:24.610 --> 42:26.009
Uh, nothing.
I was playing baseball,

42:26.040 --> 42:28.167
someone hit me
with their elbow.
Well, you need

42:28.210 --> 42:29.768
to get ice on that.

42:32.150 --> 42:33.902
(long sigh)

42:33.950 --> 42:35.679
(knocking)

42:36.680 --> 42:38.238
Yeah?

42:38.280 --> 42:41.044
GRACE:
Thanks.
Yeah,

42:41.090 --> 42:42.853
Stiles is
a jerk, huh?

42:42.890 --> 42:45.051
Yeah, I know.

42:45.090 --> 42:46.785
But...

42:46.830 --> 42:48.695
thank you.

42:50.100 --> 42:51.863
No problem.

42:58.170 --> 42:59.239
