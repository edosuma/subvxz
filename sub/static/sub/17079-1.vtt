02:33.042 --> 02:34.439
Matt

02:34.737 --> 02:36.893
Let the ghost be.

02:37.279 --> 02:40.701
Its fourteen years.
Its time you buried the dead.

02:40.923 --> 02:42.440
They're buried, Cap.

02:43.126 --> 02:46.765
Bust you wanna walk over
their grave again, to make sure.

02:46.939 --> 02:50.494
Got a great idea:
European Tour.

02:50.710 --> 02:53.240
- What do you say?
- Its no good.

02:53.379 --> 02:57.187
Berlin, Madrid, Paris,
Vienna, Budapest.

02:57.319 --> 02:58.886
They got a nice sound.

02:59.014 --> 03:04.437
Europe's just a big Jonah for
American circuses.

03:04.564 --> 03:07.095
- They were in for the money.
- And you ain't?

03:07.572 --> 03:09.644
I love a circus.

03:10.665 --> 03:13.461
Matt, Lili's gone.
Forget her.

03:13.928 --> 03:16.639
When she ran out that night
it was over.

03:16.851 --> 03:20.406
Like that puff ofwind.
Its gone.

03:22.062 --> 03:23.074
Matt,

03:23.206 --> 03:25.448
Let it stay that way.

03:29.392 --> 03:31.380
Got a lot to do tomorrow, Cap.

05:08.000 --> 05:10.412
Ladies and gentlemen!

05:10.923 --> 05:15.772
You have witnessed our last
performance of the season.

05:16.370 --> 05:19.336
Tomorrow our circus bids
goodbye to its native land,

05:19.575 --> 05:22.300
the U.S.A. and sails for
Europe,

05:22.535 --> 05:25.555
to raise our tents in all
its capitals.

05:25.790 --> 05:32.593
At this time the ushers sell tickets
for celebrating our attraction.

05:32.951 --> 05:37.700
However, tonight, we invite you
to be our guests.

05:38.000 --> 05:43.616
And now, the greatest Wild
West Show in the World!

05:53.945 --> 05:57.417
On your mark.

06:32.002 --> 06:34.186
And now,

06:34.666 --> 06:40.032
the Great Stage Coach
robbery!

08:27.775 --> 08:33.299
You are now about to witness
a race between man and beast.

09:00.326 --> 09:03.994
Ladies and gentlemen,

09:05.044 --> 09:09.154
the Roman Race!

10:11.325 --> 10:12.465
Toni, are you all right?

10:13.406 --> 10:14.735
- Are you hurt?
- No.

10:14.959 --> 10:16.170
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

10:16.390 --> 10:18.789
- Are you all right, Toni?
- It's nothing. - Yes.

10:19.090 --> 10:21.050
- Get the next act on, Cap!
- Yes, sir.

10:21.270 --> 10:22.720
- Have May drive for Toni.
- Right!

10:23.578 --> 10:24.675
Are you sure you are O.K?

10:24.892 --> 10:25.482
Yes.

10:25.612 --> 10:27.215
What happened?

10:27.349 --> 10:30.687
There was a bird in the tent.

10:31.883 --> 10:36.061
Ladies and gentlemen,

10:36.579 --> 10:38.101
We offer you tonight,

10:38.497 --> 10:44.720
a cast of daring with hair
raising feats of skill.

10:46.712 --> 10:48.215
Still seeing things, eh?

10:48.430 --> 10:50.778
It was there, that's why
I slipped.

10:51.051 --> 10:53.523
A bird in the tent is one of
the very worst omens.

10:53.810 --> 10:56.978
There's no sense on superstitions,
Toni. Its unreal.

10:57.507 --> 10:59.350
Part of a make-believe world.

10:59.635 --> 11:01.547
What's wrong with a
Make-believe world?

11:01.835 --> 11:04.026
Its for weak people,
to hide in.

11:04.277 --> 11:05.661
I m not hiding in anything, Matt.

11:05.991 --> 11:07.714
Look at that rabbit's foot
around your neck!

11:07.937 --> 11:10.681
Horse hair in your handkerchief
and owl feathers.

11:10.968 --> 11:15.004
You can't perform with things like that
in your mind. It's dangerous.

11:15.314 --> 11:18.541
Matt, those are good omens,
like you.

11:19.031 --> 11:20.591
Your are a good omen.

11:20.977 --> 11:23.384
All good omens make good
things happen.

11:23.753 --> 11:25.062
I guess I raised you wrong.

11:25.296 --> 11:27.558
No, you haven't.

11:28.065 --> 11:31.535
You raised me as good as any
real father could.

11:32.076 --> 11:34.212
What are you afraid of, Toni?

11:35.064 --> 11:38.634
Almost everything. I was scared
of going to Europe.

11:39.025 --> 11:42.371
This morning I found a milk
white butterfly.

11:42.779 --> 11:44.704
That means I'm going
to have a wonderful trip.

11:45.296 --> 11:48.527
A butterfly is a moth.
A moth means moth holes.

11:48.746 --> 11:51.563
It's all bunkum: omens,
hexes, voodoo...

11:51.800 --> 11:53.314
It's all bunkum.

11:53.534 --> 11:56.277
Come in! I'll prove it to you.

11:59.300 --> 12:01.234
Oh, no, bread and butter!

12:04.845 --> 12:06.131
Oh, Matt, please!

12:06.351 --> 12:07.505
- Leave the hat there.
- The hat is on the bed.

12:07.725 --> 12:09.293
Leave it there, Toni!

12:10.166 --> 12:12.758
Now! Oh, stand back!

12:13.265 --> 12:15.748
Because I'm going to bust
a ten dollar mirror.

12:16.177 --> 12:20.982
But, it would be cheap if it proves to you
that superstitions are for crazy heads.

12:25.870 --> 12:28.862
Dont be scared. It doesn't count
if you do it on purpose.

12:29.249 --> 12:32.312
Scared? That mirror business
is all bunkum.

12:32.503 --> 12:34.033
I was just a little careless.

12:43.930 --> 12:45.170
Well!

12:45.390 --> 12:47.896
Its a good thing.
It was a Stetson.

12:57.138 --> 12:59.379
You can't say I didn't try.

12:59.511 --> 13:03.704
Matt, I don t worry about
omens when you re around.

13:03.832 --> 13:06.759
Because when you love somebody,
nothing can hurt you.

13:06.975 --> 13:09.169
And, I Iove you, Matt.

13:09.298 --> 13:11.708
You sure cheer a fella up.

13:12.730 --> 13:15.175
You better get to finishing
your packing.

13:15.314 --> 13:17.977
I'll got Steve to pick you up.

13:18.111 --> 13:24.354
Oh, I'm glad you found that
lousy milk white butterfly.

13:27.940 --> 13:30.341
That was a lot of yelling you
were doing to Toni.

13:30.556 --> 13:31.907
Family discussion.

13:32.116 --> 13:35.218
You can't get away from the fact that
there was a bird in that tent,

13:35.437 --> 13:38.821
the night that Alfredo fell
and her ma ran out.

13:39.039 --> 13:40.478
You got anything else on
your mind?

13:40.698 --> 13:42.458
Yes, I have Lili.

13:42.780 --> 13:46.541
If you're going to Europe, you better
do a little thinking about her.

13:46.761 --> 13:49.432
She's liable to come out
to get a look at her daughter.

13:49.651 --> 13:51.604
We'll take care of it.

13:51.821 --> 13:53.981
Why don't you mind
your own business?

13:54.285 --> 13:56.725
You got a circus to get
moving.

13:56.900 --> 13:57.518
Steve!

14:00.020 --> 14:01.840
Glad you signed for the tour.

14:01.969 --> 14:03.150
You shouldn't be.

14:03.282 --> 14:05.994
- Bad news?
- Are you up to hearing it?

14:06.121 --> 14:07.639
I was weaned on it.

14:07.774 --> 14:11.730
Well, at first I was thinking about trying
to talk you out of this european tour.

14:11.950 --> 14:14.247
But then I figured, just let him
go bust and I'll be around...

14:14.383 --> 14:17.812
You'd step in: New acts,
new flags in the tent,

14:18.031 --> 14:19.831
new money thrown at you.

14:20.060 --> 14:21.325
You're not sore?

14:21.459 --> 14:24.942
Why should I be? That's the way
I started ten years ago.

14:25.161 --> 14:29.241
Got tired of being a rodeo bum,
grabbed an expiring big top,

14:29.621 --> 14:32.249
kicked everybody out
and took over.

14:32.676 --> 14:34.243
That's exactly my plan.

14:34.500 --> 14:37.384
I've been clear, Matt.
You want to fire me?

14:37.516 --> 14:38.950
No, you'd better stick around.

14:39.170 --> 14:43.310
I'll feel better if I know there's a
new genius handy to take over.

14:43.530 --> 14:46.174
At the meantime, will you
bring Toni to the ship?

14:47.454 --> 14:49.189
Say, Matt...

14:49.810 --> 14:51.634
You wouldn't consider skiping this...

14:51.666 --> 14:55.820
European thing and...?
I'm asking as a friend.

14:56.577 --> 14:58.812
Thanks for saying that, Steve.

14:59.055 --> 15:02.804
Shows you ve got a big heart,
almost as big as your head.

15:03.960 --> 15:05.434
Ship leaves at two.

15:11.612 --> 15:13.248
Hello, boss!

15:51.815 --> 15:53.706
Come in.

15:54.195 --> 15:55.254
Oh, Steve!

15:55.490 --> 15:59.415
Matt asked me to come by and
take you to the ship.

15:59.751 --> 16:03.092
Come in, come in! I'll be ready
in a few minutes.

16:03.616 --> 16:05.311
Come in! Come!

16:07.555 --> 16:10.010
This is almost my favorite.

16:10.230 --> 16:14.034
Toni, don't you ever get tired of
looking at the same stuff?

16:14.654 --> 16:16.270
Oh, Steve! Look at this one.

16:16.495 --> 16:17.850
Where he's holding me
over his head.

16:18.078 --> 16:22.178
I've seen it fifty times.
Alfredo, famed circus star,

16:23.007 --> 16:25.880
starts training daughter Toni
for a trapeze career.

16:26.240 --> 16:28.934
Toni will be the greatest of
the flying Alfredos.

16:29.355 --> 16:31.780
- Says Father.
- Says Father.

16:33.033 --> 16:34.413
- That's something new, isn't?
- Yes.

16:34.730 --> 16:37.367
I put it in last week.
Isn't he sweet looking?

16:37.635 --> 16:38.551
He's a Saint,

16:38.751 --> 16:41.425
who watches over the beautiful
souls in Paradise.

16:42.042 --> 16:43.764
You know? That's where
Alfredo is.

16:44.291 --> 16:45.556
What are those things?

16:45.819 --> 16:47.400
Owl feathers.

16:47.630 --> 16:49.780
They protect you from falling.

16:50.165 --> 16:52.311
You know? Paradise is
pretty high up.

16:52.535 --> 16:55.500
You know? I think you're
a little crazy.

16:55.871 --> 16:59.276
Come on, Toni, finish packing,
will you?

17:00.289 --> 17:02.934
What's this? Too small
for you, aren't they?

17:03.155 --> 17:05.704
My first birthday present
from my Uncle Aldo.

17:08.462 --> 17:11.972
They're cute! Come in, hurry up,
Toni! I haven't got all night.

17:12.525 --> 17:15.290
I'll hurry, if you'll take me
to the bon voyage party.

17:15.510 --> 17:18.645
There's no chance.
It's no place for kids.

17:18.865 --> 17:22.270
Kids? I am a woman with
a sicilian heart.

17:22.490 --> 17:24.125
You ever hear of a vendetta?

17:24.346 --> 17:27.269
Would you stop making those faces!
It makes you look nutty.

17:27.670 --> 17:31.327
Sicilians are sensitive
like horses and proud.

17:31.590 --> 17:32.300
You just remember that.

17:32.510 --> 17:36.230
When you insult a Sicilian
it's for all his life and yours.

17:36.566 --> 17:37.900
That's a vendetta.

17:38.163 --> 17:42.327
Thank you. Thank you very much
for the information.

17:42.960 --> 17:44.930
Now, are you coming, or not?

17:45.650 --> 17:49.055
Go by yourself.
Go on. Go.

17:50.745 --> 17:52.283
All right!

17:52.777 --> 17:54.783
Steve!

17:55.070 --> 17:57.600
Steve!

18:00.468 --> 18:02.212
I hope you get seasick.

18:09.890 --> 18:11.287
All the way.

18:11.839 --> 18:15.598
Take her all the way up.
That's it. Hold it.

18:15.736 --> 18:20.183
All right, swing it in.
Take it in. Take it in.

18:28.023 --> 18:29.204
Come on, there!

18:30.226 --> 18:31.238
You did it!

18:31.540 --> 18:33.360
That's my point!
Let it ride, boys!

18:45.225 --> 18:46.490
Fifty! Cover me!

18:48.148 --> 18:49.160
Snake eyes!

18:51.665 --> 18:55.512
Pardon me. I'm Billy Hannegan
of Billboard Magazine.

18:55.795 --> 19:00.811
By the way, aren't you the daughter of
the world's most renowned artists,

19:01.033 --> 19:03.470
- the Flying Alfredos?
- Yes.

19:03.700 --> 19:06.354
I knew it, I knew it the first time
I saw you.

19:07.034 --> 19:11.792
Oh, Lili's beautiful face
and the carriage.

19:12.061 --> 19:13.629
It's unmistakable.

19:13.849 --> 19:15.127
Did you know my father?

19:15.356 --> 19:17.686
Oh, we were great chums, yeah.

19:18.925 --> 19:23.603
- Any news of your mother?
- I don't care to talk about her.

19:24.256 --> 19:27.225
It's been fourteen years since
she disappeared, hasn't it?

19:27.633 --> 19:28.602
I don't know.

19:29.236 --> 19:30.317
I think it has.

19:30.510 --> 19:32.944
The night since your father had
his fatal accident,

19:33.672 --> 19:35.684
fourteen years to the day.

19:35.945 --> 19:41.071
I undertand that you've never heard
from your mother since that sad night?

19:41.360 --> 19:44.764
Well, if it isn't my old
pal Hannegan!

19:45.023 --> 19:46.327
If theres anything I'm gonna
miss in Europe

19:46.546 --> 19:49.375
..it's the Billboard Magazine
and Hannegan.

19:49.595 --> 19:51.967
- Bring me a cup of coffee,
will you?   - Yes, Matt.

19:53.274 --> 19:54.953
But, coffee is on board.

19:57.039 --> 19:59.937
You're spoiling a good
feature story, Matt.

20:00.156 --> 20:03.642
-The story is dead. - No, no,
not this one, my dear friend.

20:03.859 --> 20:08.500
It's just coming alive:
Will the renowned Lili Alfredo

20:08.757 --> 20:13.451
come out of hiding to greet her
lovely daughter as a fellow artist?

20:13.672 --> 20:15.014
- Shake down.
- Oh, no, no, no.

20:16.650 --> 20:18.400
There's a real tear in it.

20:18.620 --> 20:22.073
How much will Billboard
Magazine pay for this tear?

20:23.601 --> 20:25.265
Well, if I let myself go, I,

20:25.685 --> 20:29.947
I might fill 25 dollars worth
of space with it.

20:30.300 --> 20:31.393
Here's fifty.

20:31.640 --> 20:35.009
Write it for me. Send it to Matt Masters,
somewhere in Europe.

20:35.679 --> 20:36.946
That's very good of you, Matt.

20:37.202 --> 20:39.394
I appreciate talent.

20:39.790 --> 20:42.906
- I don't deserve it.
- I agree.

21:20.437 --> 21:25.763
The key to the city.
Barcelona is yours.

21:26.200 --> 21:28.564
Muchísimas gracias, señor Alcalde.

21:32.319 --> 21:34.561
Ladies and gentlemen!

21:34.692 --> 21:37.355
The slide for life!

23:01.885 --> 23:02.896
Here.

23:04.469 --> 23:05.565
I'm all right.

23:41.631 --> 23:44.195
Bring out those cargo knots.
Get them over the side.

23:44.413 --> 23:47.630
Get a move on!
Bring out those cargo nets!

23:48.311 --> 23:49.829
The cargo nets!

24:02.589 --> 24:04.071
Hi, Simba!

24:04.199 --> 24:07.332
Oh, boy, oh, boy.
Whoa, boy!

24:17.842 --> 24:19.409
Easy, easy.
Yah!

24:23.053 --> 24:24.450
Get in the cage!

24:27.610 --> 24:30.514
Get back in the cage!
Cap! Cap!

24:50.193 --> 24:51.204
Cap!

24:53.347 --> 24:55.025
Swing that boom around.
Give me a line.

24:55.285 --> 24:57.534
Okay.

24:57.753 --> 25:00.570
Will you swing that boom
right over to him?

26:36.644 --> 26:38.753
How's Toni? Where's Toni?

26:40.332 --> 26:42.951
She's all right.
She's on a lifeboat.

27:00.777 --> 27:03.081
If we lose that canvas we're
out of business.

27:42.992 --> 27:45.317
Look, your honor.

27:45.449 --> 27:47.756
Tell him that we ve got divers down
in the hold, right now,

27:47.973 --> 27:50.497
looking for the safe
and the cash boxes.

27:50.777 --> 27:53.150
We're doing the best we can.
Explain that to him.

27:53.378 --> 27:58.000
He says they are looking for the safe
and the cash boxes.

27:58.700 --> 28:00.812
- That's where I'm going.
- Stop, stop, stop.

28:02.228 --> 28:05.819
- You wait here.
- No, no, no.

28:08.188 --> 28:10.736
He won't give me the feed for
the animals until he get paid.

28:10.965 --> 28:13.808
- Well, hang on and keep talking.
- I've been talking, Matt.

28:14.028 --> 28:16.200
He's muy simpático,
he's very sorry.

28:16.420 --> 28:19.200
He's for feeding the animals, but
he's also got a family to feed.

28:19.420 --> 28:21.270
Well, keep conversing with him.
We' ve got the divers

28:21.580 --> 28:24.341
- coming up back, maybe.
- Señor,

28:25.955 --> 28:28.914
The Port Master said with the
deepest sympathy for your problem,

28:29.150 --> 28:32.820
he says he's sorry but it is
necessary either that your ship

28:33.037 --> 28:34.567
be removed as soon as possible.

28:35.900 --> 28:38.755
Well, I understand him,
and I sympathize with him,

28:39.100 --> 28:41.955
and we are going to remove it
as soon as possible.

28:42.255 --> 28:44.675
He says he's very grateful...

28:44.895 --> 28:50.255
Matt, I hate to bother you right now,
but could you help them?

28:50.595 --> 28:54.812
They're broke, nothing to eat.
No place to sleep.

28:55.710 --> 28:57.532
Honey, how can I...?

29:00.890 --> 29:02.323
You got any money?

29:02.900 --> 29:05.421
Well...no.

29:05.816 --> 29:08.226
- Pio?
- No.

29:08.528 --> 29:09.539
And you, Toni?

29:09.672 --> 29:11.575
Me? Nothing.

29:12.080 --> 29:15.302
Same here. Havent got a
nickel, not a sou ,

29:15.524 --> 29:17.488
not a peseta.

29:17.922 --> 29:19.752
- Mr. Masters.
- Yes, Your Honor?

29:20.000 --> 29:22.303
The Harbor Master says
and believe me,

29:22.430 --> 29:25.555
he deeply regrets that if you
do not remove the ship,

29:25.784 --> 29:28.787
it becomes the responsability
of the Port Authority

29:28.930 --> 29:31.306
and it might be most expensive
for you if they...

29:31.515 --> 29:35.310
Well, let him take it, salvage it.
You're welcome to it.

29:35.530 --> 29:38.466
I just hope there'll be a little
left for our expenses.

29:39.106 --> 29:41.247
He says that there's no solution.

29:43.555 --> 29:46.559
Hey Matt! Matt!

29:46.910 --> 29:49.705
They just brought up some
of the boxes.

30:18.731 --> 30:20.803
Isn't that a picture of my mother?

30:20.934 --> 30:23.898
Yes, it is.

30:26.824 --> 30:32.958
Here, pay the men and get
some meat for those cats.

30:36.187 --> 30:39.469
Spread this among the performers
and get them something to eat.

30:39.699 --> 30:41.432
Yes, Matt.

31:41.620 --> 31:44.133
Looks like he's trying to work off
his miseries.

31:44.355 --> 31:48.658
Miseries he's got, mister. All his
animals are boarded in Spain.

31:48.885 --> 31:51.159
Nothing left in the cage boxes.

31:50.332 --> 31:53.868
And still he's trying to kill himself.

31:58.575 --> 32:00.614
Hey, Toni! Toni, I've got it!

32:01.263 --> 32:04.396
That s a part of the act that
made him a star, remember?

32:04.525 --> 32:07.658
He used to jump off the hotel roof
and make his getaway?

32:11.346 --> 32:14.233
If he's thinking what I'm thinking,
it's time to talk to the man.

32:14.463 --> 32:15.959
Come on!

32:24.862 --> 32:28.755
Hey, Matt!
You've got a few minutes?

32:29.222 --> 32:31.140
- What do you want?
- Well...

32:31.767 --> 32:33.052
While you're still
able to talk,

32:33.272 --> 32:36.517
I'd like to hear you say when
we're going home.

32:37.657 --> 32:38.745
- We are not going home.
- Oh, Matt,

32:38.936 --> 32:41.692
you can't stay here.
You're broke.

32:42.507 --> 32:47.628
I'm not broke. I got myself
a job with Ed Purdy.

32:47.858 --> 32:50.243
You got a job with Ed Purdy!

32:50.466 --> 32:52.840
When a fella's out of work,
he gets himself a job.

32:53.059 --> 32:55.957
No with Ed Purdy, you don't.
Look, Matt!

32:56.247 --> 32:59.719
Back home you got friends,
you got contacts,

32:59.948 --> 33:02.243
You can hook something good
for all of us.

33:02.504 --> 33:04.817
Well, I only asked for a job
for myself.

33:05.045 --> 33:08.273
I'm in no position to ask
favors to anyone else.

33:08.739 --> 33:12.057
You all can go or stay,
as you please.

33:17.080 --> 33:18.766
What about you, Toni?

33:20.126 --> 33:21.897
You wanna go home?

33:23.303 --> 33:25.798
Home... is where you are.

33:28.684 --> 33:30.117
What about you?

33:30.252 --> 33:33.469
I thought you were going
to stick around at pieces.

33:37.243 --> 33:38.978
Where're you going?

33:40.081 --> 33:42.491
Where do you suppose?

33:42.708 --> 33:45.799
I'm going to see Ed Purdy
about getting a job

33:46.675 --> 33:51.424
and I'll settle for a partnership
you and me. Partnership!

33:51.644 --> 33:54.420
That's a very attractive offer,
Mr. McCabe.

33:54.677 --> 33:57.409
A fella doesn't very often get
a chance to go in partnership

33:57.620 --> 33:59.740
with a horse-riding pauper.

34:00.045 --> 34:02.676
It's what you need right now,
a partner.

34:02.945 --> 34:04.854
You figuring on being a
partner to me or anybody,

34:05.078 --> 34:07.302
you'd better go out and earn it.

34:08.274 --> 34:13.034
Among the things I'm good at is,
taking advice from my elders.

34:13.315 --> 34:14.679
I'll go with you.

34:15.818 --> 34:19.918
Elders! Partners!
That Texas punk!

34:20.150 --> 34:21.962
You should have belted him.

34:22.387 --> 34:25.141
Look! Why don't you be a good boy,
take your hat in your hand,

34:25.409 --> 34:29.811
go over to Purdy and see if you can borrow
some equipment for those kids to practice.

34:30.031 --> 34:32.922
- Old Ed Purdy!
- That's right.

34:36.674 --> 34:39.172
He better be careful the way
he talks to me!

34:39.829 --> 34:42.208
I knew that phoney when...

34:43.047 --> 34:46.918
If he tries to pull anything
on me, I'll show him!

34:53.745 --> 34:55.597
Come on!

35:41.824 --> 35:43.834
Sure not causing much excitement.

35:44.046 --> 35:47.217
It's pretty dreary.
Kind of quiet, huh?

35:47.437 --> 35:48.606
Yep.

35:48.818 --> 35:51.501
- Wanna change it?
- How?

35:52.120 --> 35:53.631
Let's go into the opening act.

35:53.845 --> 35:55.290
You gotta be kidding!

35:55.505 --> 35:58.210
Just take the cue, boy.
Take the cue!

36:01.079 --> 36:03.790
- What's happening?
-Just hang on.

36:03.917 --> 36:04.845
What?

36:04.976 --> 36:07.031
Matt Masters!
You're not going to...

36:07.263 --> 36:12.086
Oh, yes, we are.
Let's go!

36:22.971 --> 36:26.104
Steve! Steve, stop it!

36:42.517 --> 36:45.309
- Matt!
- Come on! Knock on that!

36:47.810 --> 36:49.510
Matt!

37:35.776 --> 37:36.802
Thank you.

37:37.038 --> 37:39.824
Monsieur, je vous en prie.
Une photo.

37:40.045 --> 37:43.605
- Why not?
- Attention!  Attention!

37:44.202 --> 37:46.711
Ça c'est tout!
Je vous remercie, monsieur.

37:58.277 --> 38:02.991
Monsieur Americain,
Matt Masters l'artiste

38:03.246 --> 38:07.730
celebrant le Wild West
héroiquement arrete

38:07.961 --> 38:10.499
une coach de Deadwood Dick

38:10.765 --> 38:14.503
au Champs Elysées.
Bravo, Matt Masters!

38:15.191 --> 38:18.740
Premier artiste de la Far West!

38:19.377 --> 38:23.300
Purdy was sore at you when he saw
that crowd tonight.

38:23.510 --> 38:25.600
0h! Why didn't you tell him
all it was your idea?

38:26.421 --> 38:28.746
He might have made you
a partner!

38:28.879 --> 38:31.674
You've had your jokes.
You've finished your dinner.

38:31.802 --> 38:34.935
Do you want me to answer
these telegrams or not?

38:35.065 --> 38:37.643
One's Hagenbeck in Copenhagen.

38:37.776 --> 38:40.307
There's one from London,
Associated Shows.

38:40.573 --> 38:43.235
Can use your animals?
How much?

38:43.369 --> 38:45.733
Have a spot for Liberty Horses.
How much?

38:45.956 --> 38:49.041
- Answering?
- Sure.

38:52.182 --> 38:54.393
What are you trying to do,
get me drunk?

38:54.600 --> 38:56.308
To be frank, yes.

38:56.551 --> 38:59.962
That way you might say a fewwords
about our secret future.

39:00.184 --> 39:02.540
Well, you don't have
to get me drunk,

39:02.829 --> 39:05.820
I'm gonna build a new show.

39:06.541 --> 39:10.603
I swear I'll never use that dirty word
again, but when do we sail?

39:10.932 --> 39:13.965
We don't. We stay right here.

39:14.590 --> 39:16.451
You can't build a circus here,
in Paris.

39:16.671 --> 39:18.480
There ain't five Frenchmen
that can sit a horse.

39:18.700 --> 39:20.625
Always thinking of a dog
and pony show.

39:20.845 --> 39:22.477
I am talking about a Circus.

39:23.428 --> 39:25.278
Europe is the home of the Circus.

39:25.419 --> 39:29.199
All the big acts came from here,
Belgium, Germany, France...

39:29.545 --> 39:30.787
The big name families:

39:31.107 --> 39:34.295
The Hannefords, the Bradnas,
the people that spell Circus.

39:34.525 --> 39:37.041
They were born here.
So I figured that

39:37.712 --> 39:42.034
while we're taking this little tour
in Europe at Purdy's expense,

39:42.616 --> 39:44.880
we can pick up a few
of these great acts,

39:45.342 --> 39:47.462
and build a real show.

39:48.200 --> 39:51.324
Matt, I'm for it! That's new thinking.

39:51.542 --> 39:53.580
Showmanship,
that's what I'm good at.

39:53.860 --> 39:58.204
We can latch on to them before Barnum,
before Sells-Flot all the rest.

39:58.470 --> 40:00.481
Say, the Medrano Circus is in town.

40:00.730 --> 40:02.780
I'll go over and see if they
got anything good enough

40:03.000 --> 40:05.271
for the new Master-McCabe
United Shows.

40:05.572 --> 40:07.072
Come in, Toni!

40:07.822 --> 40:10.924
I llok that I might be a silent partner,
but I'm a partner.

40:11.142 --> 40:14.446
- You mind if I go?
- If you can stand him.

40:18.752 --> 40:20.600
Well, at least he gives me
top billing.

40:20.820 --> 40:23.900
Now listen. Not that I'm gonna object
to anything, anymore,

40:24.220 --> 40:25.666
but I wanna get this straight.

40:25.970 --> 40:28.690
We stay with Purdy for the rest
of the European playdates,

40:28.910 --> 40:34.963
and in our spare time we visit
carnivals and look and look?

40:35.183 --> 40:38.215
That's about the size of it.
I look and look...

40:38.440 --> 40:40.222
And you're gonna find Lili.

40:40.580 --> 40:43.477
Sure! Lili Alfredo!

40:43.717 --> 40:48.277
That's why we stumble in around
Europe. You still love her.

40:48.678 --> 40:50.223
Why don't you get drunk!

40:50.485 --> 40:54.678
You plastered this Continent for two
solid years with cablegrams.

40:54.895 --> 40:57.538
- Where's Lili? Where's Lili?
- Not for me, for Toni.

40:57.757 --> 40:59.561
I stopped looking
when Toni was four.

40:59.750 --> 41:01.100
You're still looking.

41:01.233 --> 41:04.129
Get this in that empty head
of yours and keep at there!

41:04.460 --> 41:05.430
Lili is alive

41:06.018 --> 41:08.426
I could'nt care less
and if she's dead,

41:08.991 --> 41:10.022
I m not mourning her.

41:10.242 --> 41:12.229
Alive or dead, she's gone.

41:14.411 --> 41:16.355
- Where are you going?
- To get some fresh air.

41:16.573 --> 41:19.791
It's too hot in here from that torch
you're carrying.

45:17.440 --> 45:19.000
- Aren't they wonderful?
- Yeah.

45:19.220 --> 45:22.400
That little girl is wonderful too.

45:58.128 --> 46:00.800
- Tojo, I m delighted.
- Glad to see you, Mr. Masters.

46:01.000 --> 46:02.226
Thank you.

46:02.365 --> 46:05.835
We've heard about your terrible misfortune.
We're all very sorry about it.

46:06.916 --> 46:09.436
But I understand you're looking for
some acts for a new circus.

46:09.567 --> 46:11.763
That's right, Giorgio. That's what
I wanna talk to you about.

46:11.981 --> 46:16.135
Oh, good! Would you like
to come in, please?

46:16.355 --> 46:17.524
- Thank you.
- If you don't mind,

46:17.747 --> 46:19.253
- I'll take this stuff off.
- All right.

46:19.481 --> 46:20.915
I'll only be a minute.

46:21.049 --> 46:22.869
Take your time.

46:24.127 --> 46:25.624
Hello.

46:25.752 --> 46:28.246
- What's your name?
- Giovanna, sir.

46:29.269 --> 46:30.919
I bet you love the ballet?

46:31.048 --> 46:32.819
Oh, yes, I do.

46:32.955 --> 46:36.209
I've been studying a long time,
since I was five.

46:36.344 --> 46:39.477
That make-believe wire act
you do is beautiful.

46:39.607 --> 46:41.040
Thank you, sir.

46:41.174 --> 46:43.886
I wondered, could you really walk
a high wire?

46:44.013 --> 46:47.925
- No, sir. I've never tried.
- That's too bad.

46:48.135 --> 46:51.773
It would be wonderful if you could...
Ballet dancing on a wire.

46:52.200 --> 46:56.313
-Oh! -The ballerina and the clown
in the hinge wire act.

46:56.484 --> 46:58.085
Interested, Tojo?

46:58.309 --> 47:00.267
Yes, very much.

47:00.490 --> 47:04.922
Uncle Tojo will teach me to dance in
a high wire. I will be very good.

47:05.146 --> 47:06.600
- Honest.
- I believe you.

47:06.820 --> 47:08.801
Still the fine showman.

47:09.022 --> 47:10.639
Eh, Matt?

47:12.031 --> 47:13.331
- Aldo.
- Yes.

47:14.231 --> 47:19.286
Aldo Alfredo, formerly of...
the Three Alfredos.

47:22.700 --> 47:24.982
Where's Lili?

47:26.034 --> 47:27.334
Haven't you heard from her?

47:27.555 --> 47:30.139
- Where's Lili?
- I don't know.

47:30.400 --> 47:33.140
The last time I saw her was in
Copenhagen.

47:33.370 --> 47:36.368
She was... she was working in
a show under another name.

47:36.680 --> 47:40.276
When I went over to speak to her,
she ran away.

47:40.692 --> 47:45.381
I...I dont know if it's true,
but now I hear she is in...

47:46.170 --> 47:48.150
Hamburg.

47:50.577 --> 47:53.500
Now, I suppose you're not interested
any more in...?

47:53.772 --> 47:56.619
In the ballerina and the clown
on the high wire?

47:57.222 --> 47:58.896
I'm not buying trouble.

47:59.150 --> 48:01.575
Look, Matt. There'll be no trouble.

48:01.957 --> 48:04.001
I'm only interested in
Giovanna's future.

48:04.344 --> 48:07.459
- A success.
- Well, well, well!

48:07.719 --> 48:10.441
Looks like you finally found
something.

48:10.666 --> 48:14.117
- Aldo Alfredo.
- Cap Carson.

48:14.329 --> 48:16.709
You can't give this guy a job!

48:16.955 --> 48:19.662
It's like hiring your own executioner!

48:19.884 --> 48:23.093
That's over. The story of
my brother is forgotten.

48:23.444 --> 48:25.281
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Matt...

48:25.504 --> 48:29.023
- Oh, isn't she lovely!
- Beautiful.

48:29.351 --> 48:32.328
- You're Toni Alfredo?
- Yes, I am.

48:34.073 --> 48:36.312
Well, Toni, I'd like to meet
my niece: Giovanna.

48:36.537 --> 48:40.627
- Hello. - Hello.
- And I'm Tojo, the clown.

48:40.869 --> 48:44.190
How do you do? I saw you dancing.
You're lovely.

48:44.410 --> 48:46.005
It will be much better on
the high wire.

48:46.624 --> 48:49.598
Please, Mr. Masters!
Will you take us?

48:50.027 --> 48:52.305
That's, is up to your uncle.

48:53.219 --> 48:56.282
Giovanna and I will be very happy
to join you.

48:56.775 --> 48:58.262
- Won't we?
- Yes.

48:58.945 --> 49:01.760
Well, Toni, it looks like
we've hired ourselves an act,

49:02.122 --> 49:05.193
and if you don't change your mind,
we winter quarter in Madrid.

49:05.484 --> 49:06.734
See you there.
Good luck.

49:06.957 --> 49:10.539
No, not good luck. It's bad
to wish good luck.

49:10.760 --> 49:13.104
You kick them and say:
Break a leg.

49:13.319 --> 49:14.762
Of course, break a leg.

49:14.992 --> 49:18.256
- Oh, good job.
- Giovanna, work hard.

49:18.565 --> 49:20.226
I will, I promise.
Goodbye.

49:20.444 --> 49:22.724
- Goodbye. - Bye, bye.
- Bye.

51:30.300 --> 51:33.764
Wait here.
I'm gonna talk to this act.

51:55.200 --> 51:56.436
Is there something you want?

51:56.700 --> 51:59.874
I'd Iike to talk to Mr. Schuman
when it's convenient.

52:01.600 --> 52:04.207
I'm Mrs. Schuman.
What do you want?

52:04.446 --> 52:07.608
Oh, Mrs. Schuman, I'm Matt Masters.
We re getting together a circus...

52:07.831 --> 52:11.039
I know, Mr. Master. You don't need
to tell me. Everybody knows.

52:11.398 --> 52:14.101
News travels fast in Circus World.

52:14.273 --> 52:17.413
Yes, I guess that answers all the
questions except the important one:

52:17.628 --> 52:18.924
Are you interested?

52:19.247 --> 52:20.958
Listen,

52:21.003 --> 52:24.853
Emile has been doing this act
for three seasons now.

52:25.104 --> 52:28.343
Every season they ask for more lions
to be sitting on him.

52:28.642 --> 52:30.968
I mean, lying down on him.

52:31.383 --> 52:33.745
Emile is getting very tired
of lions.

52:33.996 --> 52:37.675
I can't say that I blame him. But
I've something else in mind.

52:38.128 --> 52:39.740
- What?
- Tigers.

52:39.969 --> 52:42.451
- Tigers!
- You want me

52:42.755 --> 52:47.013
to lie down in the cage and the
tigers lie on top of me?

52:47.300 --> 52:48.473
No, monsieur!

52:48.720 --> 52:52.259
Emile! No snap judgment.

52:53.220 --> 52:55.512
Every time a lion drops on me,

52:55.925 --> 52:57.842
I'm playing Russian Roulette.

52:57.889 --> 53:02.216
But tigers?
No, monsieur, no, no!

53:03.255 --> 53:05.497
Let's get down to business.

53:05.628 --> 53:09.667
I bought these lions for Emile.
If you expect me now to buy...

53:09.888 --> 53:12.426
No, we have plenty of tigers.

53:12.808 --> 53:16.778
All right, then.
I'll speak to my husband,

53:17.025 --> 53:20.432
until he makes the right decision.

53:20.688 --> 53:22.850
Good. Thank you.

53:26.728 --> 53:29.339
Emile, this is our biggest opportunity.

53:30.306 --> 53:32.999
You need to change your acting, Emile.

53:36.705 --> 53:38.988
Isn't she lovely?
Lili's girl.

53:39.148 --> 53:41.177
She's beautiful, huh?

53:41.417 --> 53:46.470
Hello, Mr. Masters.
You don't remember me, I bet.

53:46.398 --> 53:47.832
Flo Hunt, tumbling act.

53:48.080 --> 53:51.792
That's me! Broke me back.
No more cartwheels.

53:52.066 --> 53:54.801
-Got married. Four kids.
Easier work.  - Great.

53:55.001 --> 53:56.503
- I'm wardrobe here.
- Good.

53:56.734 --> 54:00.300
The girls are longing to meet you,
Mr. Masters. Fritzie, Anna.

54:00.520 --> 54:03.159
- Ladies. - I was telling
them about Toni.

54:03.845 --> 54:07.315
Haven't seen her since she was five.
I recognized her.

54:07.446 --> 54:10.868
Same beautiful face as Lili.
Fritzie knows Lili.

54:11.005 --> 54:13.246
Oh, a tragedy that Lili!

54:13.462 --> 54:16.196
Maybe seeing her daughter
will help?

54:16.415 --> 54:18.074
Seeing her?

54:18.208 --> 54:20.641
You mean, she hasn't?
But she's here in Hamburg.

54:20.860 --> 54:21.365
Lili?

54:21.496 --> 54:23.484
Don't worry.
She'll turn up.

54:23.614 --> 54:28.688
Yes, Mr. Masters. In Leipzig she
talked all the time about Toni.

54:29.495 --> 54:32.295
Oh, do you have Lili's address?

54:32.427 --> 54:34.872
I knew where she lived a month ago.

54:35.011 --> 54:37.252
but I meant to write.
Yes?

54:38.824 --> 54:39.538
Mr. Masters...

54:41.996 --> 54:44.610
Pardon me.
Be right back.

54:46.784 --> 54:49.784
My husband says:
No tigers.

54:49.919 --> 54:51.381
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- But I like the idea.

54:51.600 --> 54:54.199
It's new faces in the act.
So, don't worry.

54:54.440 --> 54:57.052
I know how to handle him.
I will let you know.

54:57.653 --> 55:00.093
My husband always does the
right thing in the end.

55:00.312 --> 55:03.532
Thanks. Aman is lucky to have
a smart woman to guide him.

55:03.782 --> 55:06.711
- Thank you.
- I'll be glad to listen from you soon.

55:06.932 --> 55:08.523
You will.

55:17.733 --> 55:19.428
I got it!

55:19.899 --> 55:21.429
Let me write it down.

55:54.935 --> 55:56.937
- A beer.
- Ja vohl!

56:03.505 --> 56:05.261
I'm looking for someone.

56:05.522 --> 56:10.216
This picture was taken some
time ago. Have you seen her?

56:11.824 --> 56:15.925
Ja, ja volhl! That's Margot.
She's around sometimes.

56:16.394 --> 56:19.002
Well, good. Maybe you could
give me her address.

56:19.252 --> 56:21.941
Her address?
She's living upstairs.

56:25.728 --> 56:27.496
Well... is she in now?

56:27.716 --> 56:30.807
No, she's been gone for
a few days.

56:32.931 --> 56:34.151
Could I look at her room?

56:34.325 --> 56:36.397
Sure, of course, of course. Sure.

56:39.090 --> 56:40.533
- Hilda!
- Yeah?

56:40.743 --> 56:42.636
Der Americano.

56:46.633 --> 56:49.276
What's up?

56:50.040 --> 56:51.670
Show this gentleman
Margot's room.

56:51.940 --> 56:54.724
- Margot? She's not there.
-Show him the room.

56:54.960 --> 56:58.331
All right. This way, mister.

57:06.087 --> 57:09.265
- You know Margot?
- Yes, I do.

57:09.481 --> 57:12.327
She doesn't come back for two
days. Always getting lost.

57:13.457 --> 57:17.456
Lot of girls like that and you can
tell the ones want to get lost.

57:18.257 --> 57:23.700
Like Margot, you see her and then
you don't see her for longtime.

57:27.010 --> 57:29.015
Voilà!

58:03.853 --> 58:06.649
Looks to me she's not coming back.

58:06.777 --> 58:09.825
God knows there is no much
to come back to.

58:10.039 --> 58:13.503
I asked Margot once: Why do you
pick out a room so plain,

58:13.722 --> 58:15.442
like a prison?
So he says:

58:15.674 --> 58:18.538
'Plain is more peaceful,
like in the convent'.

58:19.147 --> 58:22.237
- Convent? - Yeah. She was
in the convent.

58:22.500 --> 58:24.390
Nobody's allowed to talk there.

58:24.610 --> 58:28.040
Just work and pray.
She told me.

58:28.369 --> 58:30.503
She wants to be a nun,
so she can forget.

58:30.932 --> 58:34.127
Do you understand?
Get lost, you know.

58:35.155 --> 58:39.604
You know that can get lost good in one
of those women's religious places.

58:39.841 --> 58:43.058
Yeah, you can see that there,

58:43.323 --> 58:45.376
she still got all that stuff.

58:45.682 --> 58:47.937
Crosses, beads, little books,

58:48.219 --> 58:50.183
candles, everything.

59:01.274 --> 59:03.346
Are you a relative?

59:04.431 --> 59:07.406
No, no relative.

59:08.349 --> 59:09.530
Friend?

59:12.840 --> 59:15.804
Yes, I was, a long time ago.

59:16.569 --> 59:20.117
Are you what she was trying
to forget?

59:23.899 --> 59:25.501
I was part of it.

59:26.225 --> 59:27.507
Merci.

59:27.800 --> 59:31.575
When you see Margote,
will say hello from Hilda?

59:32.716 --> 59:34.262
I will, Hilda.

59:34.485 --> 59:37.456
- Good.
- Much obliged.

01:00:09.673 --> 01:00:11.285
One.

01:02:03.268 --> 01:02:05.038
May I? I mean,
if you're not using them.

01:02:05.280 --> 01:02:07.622
- Yes, of course you can.
-Thank you.

01:02:51.335 --> 01:02:54.790
I yuou're finished, do you
need the binoculars?

01:03:40.945 --> 01:03:42.603
Toni, are you all right?

01:03:42.828 --> 01:03:44.699
I think so.

01:03:50.840 --> 01:03:52.161
What happened?

01:03:52.354 --> 01:03:55.222
I was out there, everything
was going fine.

01:03:55.444 --> 01:03:57.220
I had a good hold, then...

01:03:58.390 --> 01:04:02.455
...then, I got a strange feeling.
I don't know why.

01:04:02.725 --> 01:04:04.850
At least, there wasn't
a bird in the tent.

01:04:05.070 --> 01:04:07.497
Come on, we'll have Doc
look at that.

01:04:13.989 --> 01:04:15.000
How's the ankle, Toni?

01:04:15.221 --> 01:04:16.840
It will be fine with this
tight bandage.

01:04:17.060 --> 01:04:18.797
Good. I'm going to change.

01:04:20.323 --> 01:04:22.986
Now stand on it Toni.
See how that feels.

01:04:24.347 --> 01:04:25.403
It's all right, Doctor.

01:04:25.619 --> 01:04:27.521
Put your boot on and it'll
keep the swelling down.

01:04:27.774 --> 01:04:29.816
Thank you.

01:04:32.490 --> 01:04:33.917
Good.

01:04:35.661 --> 01:04:38.456
- You forgot your things.
- Oh, thanks.

01:04:39.474 --> 01:04:41.869
Is it very bad your ankle?

01:04:42.077 --> 01:04:44.554
No, I sprain something
all the time.

01:04:44.770 --> 01:04:49.132
Soak it tonight in salt.
That's very good for sprains.

01:04:49.081 --> 01:04:50.365
Really?

01:04:51.166 --> 01:04:53.966
You're a circus performer.
I mean, used to be.

01:04:54.912 --> 01:04:56.143
How can you tell?

01:04:56.545 --> 01:04:58.447
From the way you stand.

01:05:00.159 --> 01:05:02.516
Yes, I used to work in shows.

01:05:02.953 --> 01:05:04.324
Did you ever work up high?

01:05:04.545 --> 01:05:07.405
They won't let me, but
I sneak in a lot of practice.

01:05:08.178 --> 01:05:09.470
On the trapeze?

01:05:09.691 --> 01:05:12.185
Yes, flying.
And I'm going at it, too.

01:05:12.495 --> 01:05:15.777
Because my father was
the best in the world.

01:05:15.831 --> 01:05:18.717
If you've been in shows,
you must have heard of him:

01:05:18.965 --> 01:05:20.557
The Flying Alfredo.

01:05:20.810 --> 01:05:22.987
Yes, I heard of him.
Years ago.

01:05:23.245 --> 01:05:26.106
He was the only who ever did
a triple somersault.

01:05:26.400 --> 01:05:28.968
Nobody has ever done it
since him.

01:05:31.361 --> 01:05:33.709
Was your mother in the circus?

01:05:35.377 --> 01:05:37.215
I don't remember.

01:05:40.263 --> 01:05:42.803
Could I ask you something
personal?

01:05:44.434 --> 01:05:45.926
What's that?

01:05:46.262 --> 01:05:48.484
- If you're looking for a job, I...
- Oh!

01:05:48.742 --> 01:05:51.276
Thank you.
You are very kind.

01:05:51.551 --> 01:05:54.192
I like talking to old circus
performers.

01:05:54.922 --> 01:05:59.864
I'm sorry, I didn't mean old,
I mean... veterans.

01:06:00.457 --> 01:06:03.516
And I like talking to the
young ones.

01:06:03.860 --> 01:06:06.335
Especially a girl who's going
to be a big star.

01:06:06.857 --> 01:06:09.475
Maybe, if the omens are right.

01:06:09.770 --> 01:06:12.298
- Oh, I'm on the next.
-Hey, Toni!

01:06:12.628 --> 01:06:14.340
- Yes?
- Can you make it?

01:06:15.390 --> 01:06:16.824
Yes. Easy.

01:06:17.125 --> 01:06:19.388
- Okay, two minutes.
- Goodbye.

01:06:20.472 --> 01:06:21.579
Is something the matter?

01:06:21.800 --> 01:06:26.375
Oh, no. It's been so nice
talking to you.

01:06:26.757 --> 01:06:29.537
- Good luck.
- Thank you. Goodbye.

01:06:30.929 --> 01:06:33.651
Where's the shot gun?
Come on. Get up on it.

01:06:53.595 --> 01:06:56.107
Well, it happened.

01:06:56.615 --> 01:06:59.749
- What? - I just saw
an old friend of yours.

01:07:00.321 --> 01:07:02.588
- Where is she?
- Over by the hospital.

01:07:53.545 --> 01:07:55.053
Lili!

01:08:02.410 --> 01:08:03.773
Leave me alone!

01:08:07.906 --> 01:08:09.087
Oh, Lili!

01:08:13.626 --> 01:08:16.880
Changed a little bit,
people change.

01:08:18.410 --> 01:08:20.032
It' s been a long time, Matt.

01:08:20.161 --> 01:08:24.812
Nearly fifteen years. Oh, Matt,
don't look at me!

01:08:27.616 --> 01:08:31.207
I saw a friend of yours
in Hamburg.

01:08:31.519 --> 01:08:34.014
She said to say hello.

01:08:34.290 --> 01:08:38.883
Hilda? You were there?

01:08:39.880 --> 01:08:41.850
Oh, Matt!

01:08:42.874 --> 01:08:45.627
Why, Lili? Why? Answer me!
Why did you do it?

01:08:45.826 --> 01:08:47.201
Leave me alone!

01:08:47.430 --> 01:08:49.327
How long do you think
you can keep running away?

01:08:49.578 --> 01:08:53.594
How long are you gonna flop around
in cheap joints sucking your soul?

01:08:53.832 --> 01:08:57.737
I killed him! I killed...

01:09:19.377 --> 01:09:21.246
Señora?

01:09:37.444 --> 01:09:39.893
What are you hiding from, Lili?

01:09:40.880 --> 01:09:43.077
I killed Alfredo.

01:09:43.939 --> 01:09:48.926
Just as if I'd used a knife.
I killed him!

01:09:49.207 --> 01:09:52.417
All right. You killed him or I did,

01:09:53.053 --> 01:09:57.177
or maybe it was something neither
of us could help or anybody.

01:09:57.425 --> 01:10:01.127
Because God knows we didn't just 
wake up one morning and say:

01:10:01.695 --> 01:10:03.847
Today we're gonna fall in love.

01:10:04.428 --> 01:10:05.780
But it happened, though.

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:08.106
What happened, happened, Lili.
You've paid.

01:10:08.700 --> 01:10:13.460
Go away, Matt! Find yourself
a life with someone.

01:10:13.750 --> 01:10:15.935
Let's forget about us.

01:10:16.316 --> 01:10:18.619
Say that's over, finished, through.

01:10:18.845 --> 01:10:22.241
You've got a daughter.
What about her?

01:10:27.477 --> 01:10:29.857
That night when... I saw...

01:10:30.844 --> 01:10:35.967
Alfredo dead, I ran outside.

01:10:36.187 --> 01:10:39.588
People stared, I was still
in costume.

01:10:40.629 --> 01:10:44.282
The only place I could find to hide
was in a church.

01:10:45.409 --> 01:10:47.802
In the morning the nuns found me.

01:10:48.580 --> 01:10:53.088
They gave me clothes.
They were kind to me.

01:10:54.346 --> 01:10:57.352
And... it was a heaven.

01:10:58.195 --> 01:11:00.253
It seemed like an answer.

01:11:00.861 --> 01:11:05.884
A convent! You took the easy way.

01:11:07.135 --> 01:11:11.371
Easy? I had to give up Toni.

01:11:14.177 --> 01:11:16.862
But she had you, Matt.

01:11:18.184 --> 01:11:20.421
You've been good for her.

01:11:20.640 --> 01:11:23.099
They're some things a man
just can't do.

01:11:23.498 --> 01:11:26.947
She has to learn from a woman,
from her mother!

01:11:27.315 --> 01:11:29.307
She needs you!

01:11:31.978 --> 01:11:36.196
How can I? Look at me.

01:11:37.907 --> 01:11:40.269
What would you do?

01:11:40.617 --> 01:11:43.170
I'd wash my face, I'd comb my hair

01:11:43.390 --> 01:11:45.818
and make myself decent enough
to go up to that little girl

01:11:46.040 --> 01:11:48.150
and say: I'm your mother .

01:11:51.747 --> 01:11:57.023
It's too late! I'm too tired!

01:11:57.253 --> 01:12:02.021
Too late! Still full of self pity!

01:12:05.118 --> 01:12:06.300
Cognac!

01:12:18.856 --> 01:12:24.409
Make up your mind or 
you're forever dead.

01:15:52.547 --> 01:15:54.535
-Toni, come here, please.
- Me?

01:15:59.608 --> 01:16:02.404
-Take your hat off.
- My hat off?

01:16:02.617 --> 01:16:04.050
Put the funnel on your head.

01:16:04.735 --> 01:16:07.783
No, the other way round.

01:16:12.065 --> 01:16:13.898
Now, when you catch the ball
in the funnel...

01:16:14.315 --> 01:16:17.822
- Give me...
- Five dollars!

01:16:18.834 --> 01:16:20.666
Ready?  One!

01:16:22.415 --> 01:16:26.041
One! Two!

01:16:26.174 --> 01:16:28.330
Five dollars!

01:16:28.461 --> 01:16:30.450
Don't move now. Don't move.

01:16:30.500 --> 01:16:34.360
One, two, two and a half,

01:16:33.588 --> 01:16:36.383
Go!

01:17:03.790 --> 01:17:06.411
José! Put this in the safe.

01:17:08.082 --> 01:17:10.822
Hard paying bills without
money. Take finesse.

01:17:11.193 --> 01:17:15.112
We did all right today, 81
kids, 77 grown-ups,

01:17:15.338 --> 01:17:18.965
6 dead heads. Total: 259 pesetas.

01:17:19.373 --> 01:17:21.638
- That's 43 dollars American.
- Very good.

01:17:22.357 --> 01:17:24.101
Eight thousand more
and we get our tent.

01:17:24.315 --> 01:17:26.166
- That's right.
- Any other problem?

01:17:26.388 --> 01:17:29.115
Yes. You do have a problem.

01:17:29.435 --> 01:17:32.181
Toni. She's sick and tired
of playing clown.

01:17:32.419 --> 01:17:36.342
She got some of the wardrobe girls
fixing her up a fancy costume.

01:17:36.740 --> 01:17:38.316
She's going for the high trapeze.

01:17:36.537 --> 01:17:42.006
They'll fix her a costume
but she isn't gonna wear it.

01:17:42.856 --> 01:17:44.268
You let me know if she does.

01:17:44.486 --> 01:17:46.276
I'll let you know.

01:17:49.379 --> 01:17:50.897
Now, there be a good girl,
run up.

01:17:51.414 --> 01:17:54.933
Good girl. Run up, please.
Please, lady.

01:17:56.584 --> 01:17:57.934
Come in!

01:17:58.588 --> 01:18:00.886
No, you can't do anything
by standing outside.

01:18:01.373 --> 01:18:03.794
Come on. Get inside!

01:18:04.036 --> 01:18:07.627
Look! Look at them,
they hate me.

01:18:08.118 --> 01:18:11.157
I don't want people to think
you're a coward.

01:18:15.237 --> 01:18:16.718
You think she'll get him
to go in there?

01:18:16.938 --> 01:18:19.387
She got him all the way
from Hamburg to Madrid.

01:18:19.558 --> 01:18:21.288
I'll be able to get them in a cage.

01:18:21.510 --> 01:18:23.416
It's a big difference, lions to tigers.

01:18:23.644 --> 01:18:26.090
Wives don't notice such things.

01:18:28.516 --> 01:18:30.745
Hello, Maggie.
How's the leg?

01:18:31.040 --> 01:18:33.590
Fine. Thank you.

01:18:52.712 --> 01:18:55.395
You're one foot higher today,
but it doesn't matter. It's the same.

01:18:55.845 --> 01:18:59.509
Now, never look at your feet.
Never! Look right here.

01:19:00.622 --> 01:19:02.475
You walk with your eyes.
You, ready?

01:19:02.624 --> 01:19:04.539
- Yes.
- Go.

01:19:15.511 --> 01:19:16.964
- Nice work, Giovanna.
-Thank you.

01:19:17.255 --> 01:19:18.961
Look right here.

01:19:19.355 --> 01:19:20.967
- I'm sorry, Aldo.
- It's all right.

01:19:22.262 --> 01:19:23.993
Haven't you got some
rehearsing to do?

01:19:24.184 --> 01:19:26.262
- Yes, Sir.
- Well, get at it.

01:19:39.013 --> 01:19:42.146
All right Toni, you've had
your fun. Come on down.

01:19:42.595 --> 01:19:45.228
Matt, I'm learning beautifully.

01:19:45.578 --> 01:19:47.746
I dont want you learning
anything.

01:19:47.946 --> 01:19:51.688
I catch you up in the air again,
I'll put you back in the kitchen.

01:19:52.048 --> 01:19:54.285
You hear me? Get down.

01:19:55.190 --> 01:19:57.162
Come on down.

01:19:57.810 --> 01:20:01.141
Haven't you something to do,
riding a horse or something?

01:20:01.410 --> 01:20:03.428
Well, yeah, but, well, I...

01:20:05.379 --> 01:20:06.729
You know...

01:20:14.679 --> 01:20:16.535
Come on, Toni.

01:20:19.882 --> 01:20:22.132
- You look beautiful!
- Yeah. Oh, yeah.

01:20:22.621 --> 01:20:24.763
Go ride your horse.

01:20:44.806 --> 01:20:48.736
That's a nice looking outfit.
New?

01:20:49.375 --> 01:20:52.208
Yes, the wardrobe girls
made it for me.

01:20:52.438 --> 01:20:56.243
Oh, has Matt seen it?

01:20:56.800 --> 01:20:59.997
No, I didn't put it on for him.

01:21:02.984 --> 01:21:04.511
Do you like it?

01:21:04.803 --> 01:21:07.014
I'm getting used to it.

01:21:08.662 --> 01:21:11.759
You'd rather I wore
the Salvation Army dress?

01:21:12.038 --> 01:21:15.378
No, you look much better
in this rig, but, different.

01:21:15.706 --> 01:21:20.684
How, different?
Better different or worst different?

01:21:21.052 --> 01:21:23.820
Well, better different for me.
Matt, he's gonna...

01:21:24.029 --> 01:21:26.970
Matt will make faces.
He always does.

01:21:27.290 --> 01:21:29.982
But they never last long.
He'll be all right by tomorrow,

01:21:30.299 --> 01:21:34.027
or... or anyway the day after.

01:21:46.283 --> 01:21:48.704
Toni told me you bawled her
out this morning.

01:21:48.924 --> 01:21:50.936
Yes, I did.

01:21:51.534 --> 01:21:53.896
For going up on the high trapeze?

01:21:55.110 --> 01:21:58.906
Look, with Lili for a mother
and Alfredo for a father,

01:21:59.163 --> 01:22:01.813
isn't that kind like
bawling out a duck

01:22:02.045 --> 01:22:04.895
- for taking the water?
- She's just a kid.

01:22:09.949 --> 01:22:14.900
Are you gonna tell Toni that,

01:22:15.136 --> 01:22:19.551
...well, that you saw her mother?

01:22:21.080 --> 01:22:22.872
- It's your play.
- Are you?

01:22:23.144 --> 01:22:29.144
No, I'm not, and it's your
move and quit reminding me.

01:22:36.019 --> 01:22:39.053
Yeah, she's growing up fast.

01:22:39.749 --> 01:22:42.280
Looks like her baby days
are over.

01:22:58.147 --> 01:23:00.824
It's the most wonderful day
in my life.

01:23:01.044 --> 01:23:05.538
I'm a woman, I love everybody.

01:23:24.111 --> 01:23:25.815
- Well!
- You.

01:23:26.280 --> 01:23:28.516
I wanna talk to you.

01:23:38.763 --> 01:23:41.111
- You kissed Toni.
- Did I?

01:23:41.341 --> 01:23:43.434
Well, you encouraged her,
I saw it.

01:23:43.654 --> 01:23:45.856
Grabbing her and whirling
her around.

01:23:46.186 --> 01:23:48.353
That's called dancing. I like called it.

01:23:48.838 --> 01:23:52.856
A man like you taking advantage
of a kid! Do you deny it?

01:23:53.054 --> 01:23:56.203
- I deny nothing. I was...
- I'm not gonna belt you.

01:23:56.443 --> 01:23:58.005
Belt me!

01:23:58.264 --> 01:24:00.276
You sounded off in Paris
about wanting to be my partner.

01:24:00.520 --> 01:24:02.162
- That's right.
- Well, mister,

01:24:02.380 --> 01:24:04.875
you're certainly going about it
in the wrong way.

01:24:05.090 --> 01:24:09.996
Making like this this with Toni, that you'll get
nothing except a busted head.

01:24:10.208 --> 01:24:12.424
A busted head?

01:24:12.740 --> 01:24:16.500
I've never seen anything as cheap and
disgusting as the way you been working...

01:24:16.720 --> 01:24:19.115
-...your way into that little girl...
- Matt, can't I say something?

01:24:19.335 --> 01:24:21.643
- Say it.
- She's a woman.

01:24:22.054 --> 01:24:24.356
Not yet she isn't and she isn't
going to be made into one

01:24:24.577 --> 01:24:26.716
by any flight-by-night
Circus bum.

01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:30.308
When Toni meets a man it's
gonna be for true love,

01:24:30.638 --> 01:24:35.239
no penny-ante fella using her
for a blue chip.

01:24:35.569 --> 01:24:40.512
You figured me about as wrong
as any man possibly could.

01:24:43.857 --> 01:24:46.631
-Steve, where are you going?
- Steering clear at you.

01:24:46.845 --> 01:24:49.637
- Steven...   - Listen, do me a favor.
Just stay away from me.

01:24:49.980 --> 01:24:52.193
I don't want a busted head.

01:25:18.468 --> 01:25:20.039
Matt Masters, you're a bully.

01:25:20.280 --> 01:25:22.211
What are you trying to do,
ruin my life?

01:25:22.495 --> 01:25:23.502
No, wait a minute.

01:25:23.763 --> 01:25:26.681
- Don't treat me like a baby.
- I didn't call you a baby.

01:25:26.931 --> 01:25:29.074
No, but if you had your way,

01:25:29.356 --> 01:25:31.698
I'd be cooped up in a play-pen
with dolls

01:25:31.910 --> 01:25:35.890
or in a high chair eating mush and
drinking milk out of the bottle.

01:25:36.058 --> 01:25:39.563
And my clothes! Look:
I'm still wearing bloomers.

01:25:39.793 --> 01:25:42.743
Maybe you're a little grown-up,
but I've been trying to help you...

01:25:42.963 --> 01:25:46.715
Help me! Make me look like
an idiot in front of everybody.

01:25:46.935 --> 01:25:49.466
I'll never forgive you.
I'm going to grow up

01:25:49.712 --> 01:25:51.418
and you're not going to stop me.

01:25:51.638 --> 01:25:53.619
I can't stop you.
You aren't a kid any more.

01:25:53.850 --> 01:25:56.322
Then what am I? Say it,
just at me.

01:25:56.853 --> 01:25:58.071
Let me hear you say it once.
just once.

01:25:59.020 --> 01:26:01.534
You're a woman, Toni.
I got eyes.

01:26:01.905 --> 01:26:04.651
I can see it. You're a beautiful
young woman.

01:26:05.221 --> 01:26:06.945
- You're starting...
- Then why?

01:26:07.174 --> 01:26:08.980
Please, just let me talk.

01:26:09.619 --> 01:26:13.642
There's a lot of things that I
should've said before, but I can't...

01:26:14.803 --> 01:26:16.454
Go on.

01:26:16.684 --> 01:26:20.610
It's time you learned some
facts. You know facts of life.

01:26:20.830 --> 01:26:24.007
- I'm listening.
- Sometimes, with two people,

01:26:24.427 --> 01:26:26.000
well, things can get out of hand,
sometimes,

01:26:26.220 --> 01:26:27.603
and it's the woman that has
be strong.

01:26:27.853 --> 01:26:32.727
A man is generally no better
than he has to be.

01:26:32.956 --> 01:26:36.332
Look at those idiots today
ogling you and whispering.

01:26:36.593 --> 01:26:40.017
Oh! Because I wore that costume.
Why? Everybody loved it.

01:26:40.286 --> 01:26:42.329
There isn't a man in this
place you can trust.

01:26:42.587 --> 01:26:46.548
But there are exceptions. A girl
has to get married, sometimes.

01:26:47.835 --> 01:26:51.727
Toni, I'm not talking about Steve
or any man.

01:26:51.976 --> 01:26:53.928
It's you that matters.

01:26:54.269 --> 01:26:57.029
I don't want you to start off
stumbling.

01:26:57.537 --> 01:27:01.904
But, I'm in love, Matt.
Honest. In love.

01:27:02.458 --> 01:27:04.661
I guess maybe you are.

01:27:05.195 --> 01:27:06.962
I dont know what to tell you.

01:27:08.143 --> 01:27:10.120
Maybe you won't get hurt, but

01:27:10.493 --> 01:27:15.895
I just dont want you to do your
first dive without a net. That's all.

01:27:16.309 --> 01:27:19.424
It's funny. When I came in
I wanted to kill you.

01:27:20.226 --> 01:27:22.216
I'm glad you changed your mind.

01:27:23.554 --> 01:27:25.110
Matt, there's something
you're not saying.

01:27:25.322 --> 01:27:27.622
Something sad in you.
I've felt it before.

01:27:27.844 --> 01:27:28.914
Nothing like that.

01:27:29.018 --> 01:27:30.736
It isn't anything I've done,
is it?

01:27:31.310 --> 01:27:32.716
No, Toni.

01:27:32.799 --> 01:27:39.362
You've given me nothing but good
things, happiness. And I'm grateful.

01:27:39.601 --> 01:27:42.556
Oh Matt, I owe you so much.

01:27:43.027 --> 01:27:45.931
And please, don't worry.
If I do any high dive,

01:27:46.300 --> 01:27:47.705
I'll use a net.

01:28:29.660 --> 01:28:31.011
Hey, Matt!  You coming to supper?

01:28:31.285 --> 01:28:34.778
No, and close that door.

01:28:39.890 --> 01:28:41.511
Kind of cozy in here.

01:28:42.400 --> 01:28:47.432
Oh, Schuman claims one of his tigers
has got indigestion.

01:28:47.728 --> 01:28:49.232
He wants a doctor to examine him.

01:28:49.540 --> 01:28:52.547
I told him flat, I don't know
any tiger doctors.

01:28:53.788 --> 01:28:56.960
Go on to supper.
Don't bother me.

01:28:59.307 --> 01:29:00.810
What's on the program, Matt?

01:29:02.036 --> 01:29:03.430
I don't know.

01:29:03.650 --> 01:29:07.819
Maybe we ought to take the new Matt
Master's Circus and dump it in the junk yard.

01:29:08.060 --> 01:29:09.751
Are you crazy?

01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:12.637
We're only 2000 bucks shy
on the price of a tent.

01:29:12.845 --> 01:29:14.568
I'm shy a lot more than that.

01:29:14.786 --> 01:29:18.989
Matt, just come on, let's supper.
They got a new rice dish.

01:29:19.560 --> 01:29:20.827
Well, you eat it.

01:29:21.148 --> 01:29:26.040
Look, I gotta go through all
these mail, letters from agents,

01:29:26.268 --> 01:29:27.416
phony acts...

01:29:27.667 --> 01:29:29.556
Why always is come crawling out?

01:29:29.557 --> 01:29:33.857
- Matt, you're putting on a circus.
- Am I?

01:29:34.230 --> 01:29:35.901
Well, it's my opinion.

01:29:37.800 --> 01:29:41.506
In a circus you have to have
artist flying through the air,

01:29:41.770 --> 01:29:45.697
like musical notes, somebody
making a tune with them.

01:29:45.977 --> 01:29:48.183
Somebody with a calliope inside...

01:29:48.438 --> 01:29:52.227
Calliope? Weel, you got steam
coming out of your ears.

01:29:55.136 --> 01:29:56.675
Go away, Cap.

01:29:59.627 --> 01:30:01.360
Okay.

01:30:02.659 --> 01:30:04.841
And close the door.

01:30:06.748 --> 01:30:10.095
I think you and the tiger both
need a doctor.

01:30:19.139 --> 01:30:20.918
Hello, Lili.

01:30:21.689 --> 01:30:23.809
Hello, Cap.

01:30:27.789 --> 01:30:32.631
Kinda wet out of here, but,
might be worst inside.

01:30:45.673 --> 01:30:50.272
Will you make up your mind
and stop opening and close?

01:31:08.630 --> 01:31:11.728
Well, I washed my face

01:31:12.545 --> 01:31:16.945
and... I combed my hair.

01:31:22.000 --> 01:31:23.841
Look any better?

01:31:26.060 --> 01:31:27.860
About eight pounds better.

01:31:28.700 --> 01:31:30.492
Seven.

01:31:32.456 --> 01:31:37.009
A rope and a rigging will
take off another seven.

01:31:38.155 --> 01:31:43.073
Matt, do you have a spot for
another performer?

01:31:45.249 --> 01:31:49.425
- Lili, I...
- Just a performer, no relative.

01:31:50.122 --> 01:31:51.759
She'll know you.

01:31:51.970 --> 01:31:54.261
Not for a long time, Matt.

01:31:54.900 --> 01:31:57.968
And, if you don't want it,
never.

01:31:58.346 --> 01:32:01.898
- I just don't want to be a performer,
working near her.   - Matt.

01:32:02.380 --> 01:32:05.651
Hey, Matt! You in there!

01:32:09.380 --> 01:32:12.868
Oh, you're the lady who told me
about salt for my ankle.

01:32:13.150 --> 01:32:15.332
I thought you were looking for a job.

01:32:15.552 --> 01:32:18.737
Yes, I was just talking to
Mr. Masters about it.

01:32:19.180 --> 01:32:22.354
- What's your act? - High trapeze.
- Oh, I love that.

01:32:22.626 --> 01:32:26.422
Matt, you haven't got one woman
working high. We need someone.

01:32:27.104 --> 01:32:30.177
What is your full name?

01:32:30.555 --> 01:32:33.580
- Margot Angeli.
- I'm Toni Alfredo.

01:32:33.809 --> 01:32:35.816
Will you join us for supper, Margot?

01:32:36.100 --> 01:32:39.126
Well, I have to unpack, Toni.

01:32:39.624 --> 01:32:42.268
Have you eaten, Miss Angeli?

01:32:42.598 --> 01:32:45.551
No, I haven't.

01:32:45.771 --> 01:32:48.531
Well, you're more than
welcome to join us.

01:32:48.751 --> 01:32:50.511
Oh, fine!

01:32:52.480 --> 01:32:54.996
Under here you won't get wet.

01:33:28.040 --> 01:33:31.155
Good morning, Miss Angeli.
You're early.

01:33:31.515 --> 01:33:34.615
It's been a long time.
I need some practice.

01:33:34.834 --> 01:33:37.387
Well, your rigging's secure.

01:33:37.980 --> 01:33:41.131
- Thanks, Cap.
- Any time.

01:35:01.210 --> 01:35:04.443
You're all right.
You only fainted.

01:35:05.055 --> 01:35:07.532
You just lie quiet
and you'll be fine.

01:35:08.244 --> 01:35:10.399
You'll be all right.

01:35:17.745 --> 01:35:19.300
You're Aldo.

01:35:19.525 --> 01:35:21.516
I shouldn' t have surprised you
that way.

01:35:23.603 --> 01:35:26.573
- I thought...
- Did I upset you?

01:35:29.299 --> 01:35:31.872
Oh, it's nothing, Matt.
She just had a little shock.

01:35:32.519 --> 01:35:36.181
I thought she knew I was here.
I'm sorry.

01:35:46.965 --> 01:35:50.380
You fell. You're not going up again.

01:35:50.980 --> 01:35:53.869
But, it had nothing to do
with my strength.

01:35:54.709 --> 01:35:56.094
It was Aldo...

01:35:56.323 --> 01:36:01.820
He stood there looking at me in
Alfredo's eyes, in Alfredo's clothes.

01:36:02.038 --> 01:36:06.519
I... I thought it was Alfredo.
It was just my imagination.

01:36:06.850 --> 01:36:08.734
I wonder.

01:36:09.059 --> 01:36:13.742
Well, anyway it won't work out,
Lili. It can't.

01:36:14.039 --> 01:36:17.244
Because of Aldo?
I'm not afraid of him.

01:36:17.464 --> 01:36:19.710
Not Aldo, you.

01:36:20.311 --> 01:36:21.912
You and Toni.

01:36:22.323 --> 01:36:24.952
But she likes me, Matt.
Last night...

01:36:25.275 --> 01:36:27.730
Last night you were somebody
in the rain.

01:36:28.060 --> 01:36:34.060
No, there's more to it than that.
She feels something.

01:36:34.575 --> 01:36:37.830
Well, that's a feeling you're not
going to like.

01:36:38.050 --> 01:36:41.725
You're a blacked out figure
in her scrapbook, Lili,

01:36:41.947 --> 01:36:43.719
and in her life.

01:36:44.235 --> 01:36:46.850
And I did that, and I meant
to do it.

01:36:47.498 --> 01:36:50.031
Way back, when she was a
little kid,

01:36:50.260 --> 01:36:53.240
She blamed herself because
you'd gone away.

01:36:53.508 --> 01:36:56.485
It took a long time to convince her
it wasn't her fault.

01:36:56.766 --> 01:37:00.597
I could have told her the truth,
but I didn't.

01:37:00.839 --> 01:37:02.346
I lied.

01:37:02.623 --> 01:37:07.865
So she blacked you out, like I blacked
you out. I taught her that.

01:37:09.474 --> 01:37:12.660
Then, why did you go to
Hamburg?

01:37:14.655 --> 01:37:19.288
Oh Matt, let me stay
until she finds out.

01:37:19.624 --> 01:37:23.623
Maybe by then she'll get to know me.

01:37:24.977 --> 01:37:26.734
I'm not a monster.

01:37:26.959 --> 01:37:29.564
She's been hurt once.
That's enough.

01:37:30.015 --> 01:37:34.014
Well, if she hates me,
it won't hurt her to find out.

01:37:34.574 --> 01:37:39.156
She may curse me, spit at me
and tell me to get out.

01:37:39.491 --> 01:37:41.514
She has a right.

01:37:43.260 --> 01:37:45.415
And if she tells me
to go, I'll go.

01:37:46.454 --> 01:37:49.741
It won't hurt her to have revenge.

01:37:51.136 --> 01:37:54.122
What happens to you?

01:37:57.340 --> 01:37:59.493
I'll take my chances.

01:38:02.606 --> 01:38:04.855
You've got guts, Lili.

01:38:07.580 --> 01:38:09.351
I hope you win.

01:38:32.388 --> 01:38:35.320
- Isn't it wonderful?
- Oh, yeah.

01:38:35.712 --> 01:38:38.316
- What's the matter, Steve?
- Oh, nothing.

01:38:38.630 --> 01:38:41.472
Yes, you kept your eyes open
when you kissed me.

01:38:41.725 --> 01:38:43.296
I was doing sentry duty.

01:38:43.412 --> 01:38:47.908
Oh, stop worrying about Matt.
He isn't here.

01:38:48.208 --> 01:38:50.920
Toni, he's all over the places.

01:38:51.361 --> 01:38:56.200
I don't like acting like two kids,
scared of Matt.

01:38:57.200 --> 01:38:59.338
- Do you like that, Toni?
- Not entirely.

01:38:59.994 --> 01:39:03.454
I didn't tell you what was biting him,
because I didn't want to bother you.

01:39:03.944 --> 01:39:07.055
But, he thinks that I'm courting you
so I can become his partner.

01:39:07.285 --> 01:39:11.602
Using you to blackmail him.
He's a flathead!

01:39:11.824 --> 01:39:13.316
You could have told him
he was talking crazy.

01:39:13.544 --> 01:39:15.595
I didn't have much chance.
But I'm going to...

01:39:15.845 --> 01:39:18.149
- Oh, do you have to leave
right now?  - Yes.

01:39:18.590 --> 01:39:23.086
And I'm telling Matt Masters I wouldn't be
his partner, even he bated me!

01:39:23.315 --> 01:39:26.508
And the only part I want is
Toni Alfredo.

01:39:26.807 --> 01:39:30.631
- Do you have to tell him now?
- Yes, you coming?

01:39:31.089 --> 01:39:31.771
Sure.

01:39:32.793 --> 01:39:34.528
Wait a minute!

01:39:36.479 --> 01:39:37.714
Now, what are you doing?

01:39:37.960 --> 01:39:41.529
For good luck on a journey.
You're going to need some.

01:39:47.198 --> 01:39:48.969
- Now?
- Now.

01:39:53.731 --> 01:39:56.445
Well! Back together again, eh?

01:39:56.735 --> 01:39:58.343
Glad to see you two have made up.

01:39:58.570 --> 01:40:01.299
Happy faces, that's what
we need in the Circus.

01:40:01.547 --> 01:40:03.468
How you doing with your
trapeze, honey?

01:40:03.770 --> 01:40:05.835
I'm doing fine everywhere.

01:40:06.059 --> 01:40:08.482
Well, dont waste it on me.
Him!

01:40:09.090 --> 01:40:15.045
And now you can go back to your secret
hiding place, but nobody knows about.

01:41:12.862 --> 01:41:15.557
- Thank you, Goliath.
- Any time, Miss Margot.

01:41:22.056 --> 01:41:24.466
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

01:41:27.352 --> 01:41:30.485
You do those turns just beautifully.

01:41:30.615 --> 01:41:32.565
I thought I was rather stiff.

01:41:33.903 --> 01:41:35.866
I've seen you work before

01:41:36.080 --> 01:41:37.815
Somewhere.

01:41:37.944 --> 01:41:41.457
- No, no. I doubt that.
- I'm sure I have.

01:41:41.766 --> 01:41:44.169
Where did you work in the
United States?

01:41:45.020 --> 01:41:46.623
Oh, it s been a long time, Toni.

01:41:47.184 --> 01:41:49.217
And not in any shows you've
ever seen.

01:41:49.435 --> 01:41:51.218
I've seen a lot of shows with Matt.

01:41:51.480 --> 01:41:54.224
Name the shows you were in,
and I bet you I remember.

01:41:54.501 --> 01:41:56.073
Well, how did it go today,
Miss Angeli.

01:41:56.294 --> 01:41:58.524
- Twenty five turns.
- Wonderful.

01:41:58.653 --> 01:41:59.887
- Five more than yesterday.
- Great.

01:42:00.113 --> 01:42:01.412
Matt, I just told Margot
that I...

01:42:01.669 --> 01:42:02.913
What are you doing in the ground?

01:42:03.221 --> 01:42:06.996
I thought I wanted to be an
aerialist and you'd work on it.

01:42:07.127 --> 01:42:11.778
Go on! I'd Iike to see you doing
twenty five planches.

01:42:12.088 --> 01:42:14.327
That's easy.
Just watch.

01:42:20.647 --> 01:42:23.037
- Thanks for saving me.
- What brought that on?

01:42:23.309 --> 01:42:25.089
Will you count for me?

01:42:25.444 --> 01:42:27.041
I'm counting.

01:42:27.310 --> 01:42:31.128
I dont know. When she was
a little girl,

01:42:31.423 --> 01:42:34.460
she used to sit on the ring
curb and watch me work out.

01:42:34.678 --> 01:42:37.257
I remember. That's how
she learned to count,

01:42:37.698 --> 01:42:39.258
counting your turns.

01:42:40.636 --> 01:42:44.251
How much does she know
about her father and me?

01:42:45.450 --> 01:42:50.070
She knows her father died in
a fall and you disappeared.

01:42:50.346 --> 01:42:52.277
How much does she know about you?

01:42:53.529 --> 01:42:55.985
Well, I spanked her when
she was bad,

01:42:56.285 --> 01:42:58.272
loved her when she was good.

01:42:58.570 --> 01:43:00.468
I'm just there like

01:43:00.744 --> 01:43:04.120
night and day and she never
question it.

01:43:05.437 --> 01:43:09.896
Would you be afraid to let her know
the truth, about what happened?

01:43:10.560 --> 01:43:13.000
It'd be a lie to say I wasn't afraid.

01:43:13.270 --> 01:43:17.387
I don't want to lose her, Lili.
She's like my own.

01:43:23.340 --> 01:43:24.991
She needn't ever know.

01:43:25.122 --> 01:43:29.098
Oh, I intend to tell her sometime,

01:43:29.856 --> 01:43:32.189
- take my chances.
- How many?

01:43:32.432 --> 01:43:34.240
- Fifteen.
- Fifteen?

01:43:34.860 --> 01:43:36.544
It's twenty-two!

01:43:36.880 --> 01:43:39.202
Fifteen's my count.
Start over.

01:43:39.147 --> 01:43:42.336
But, start over! That's not fair!

01:43:42.555 --> 01:43:46.117
Hey, Matt! Matt, it's here the canvas!

01:43:46.335 --> 01:43:48.705
The tent! It's coming right up
the road!

01:43:48.915 --> 01:43:51.091
- Hey Toni, come on!
- Come on, everybody!

01:43:51.328 --> 01:43:54.638
- The tent! - Here's the tent!
- The tent's here!

01:43:54.908 --> 01:43:56.571
Come on! Let s go!

01:44:39.802 --> 01:44:42.043
What about the party?

01:44:43.165 --> 01:44:47.015
Let's go for it!
After we get the tent up.

01:45:20.490 --> 01:45:23.726
- Hello, boss.
- Thanks, Goliath.

01:45:25.810 --> 01:45:27.711
That deserves some coffee,
what do you say?

01:45:27.931 --> 01:45:30.971
- I'd love some.
- Then, Cap, let's get it.

01:45:55.595 --> 01:45:57.811
Dance with an old friend, Lili?

01:45:58.080 --> 01:46:00.183
And old friend, Aldo?

01:46:00.520 --> 01:46:02.799
And old enemy, then.

01:46:03.408 --> 01:46:05.941
You haven't forgiven me yet,
have you?

01:46:06.200 --> 01:46:10.253
In Sicily we say: Those who want forgiveness,
first must knock at the gates

01:46:10.729 --> 01:46:13.198
and wait for the devil to answer.

01:46:13.691 --> 01:46:16.526
Haven't I waited long enough?

01:46:40.890 --> 01:46:43.347
- Why, that big...!
- Get off at Matt! Leave them alone!

01:46:43.544 --> 01:46:46.340
Leave them alone?
It's dark out there!

01:46:46.638 --> 01:46:49.873
- Well, kids like the dark. Weren't you
ever young? - I don't know.

01:46:50.403 --> 01:46:52.467
Why don't you mind your
own business?

01:46:52.687 --> 01:46:54.700
Give me some coffee.
Come on.

01:47:19.080 --> 01:47:21.313
- Where's Lili?
- She's right.

01:47:22.585 --> 01:47:24.089
I guess she's gone.

01:47:24.325 --> 01:47:26.963
Look for her.

01:47:39.387 --> 01:47:41.185
- It was Alfredo's waltz.
- Lili!

01:47:41.404 --> 01:47:43.299
He made his swing to that
waltz.

01:47:43.682 --> 01:47:48.594
I cant stay here, Matt,
I just cant do it.

01:47:48.623 --> 01:47:52.552
Dance to it, Lli.
Dance!

01:47:55.783 --> 01:48:01.496
It's just and old waltz,
just and old piece of music.

01:48:05.697 --> 01:48:10.534
God forgive me, but I still
love you, Matt.

01:48:11.706 --> 01:48:14.156
It's nothing to be ashamed of,

01:48:14.579 --> 01:48:16.636
then or now.

01:48:20.866 --> 01:48:22.719
It's all right.

01:48:49.123 --> 01:48:51.935
Why, that's Matt with Margot!

01:48:52.455 --> 01:48:54.830
Why, that fat-head dancing.

01:48:55.100 --> 01:48:58.126
Hey, maybe we could rent him
our place behind the calliope, eh?

01:48:58.348 --> 01:49:02.449
- He knows. Oh, no, no, no.
- Oh, no, no, no.

01:49:30.059 --> 01:49:31.210
Honey, have you told Matt?

01:49:31.430 --> 01:49:33.946
Not exactly, but I hinted
about it.

01:49:34.166 --> 01:49:37.902
Church, white veil, orange blossoms
and those all omens.

01:49:38.192 --> 01:49:39.810
But, did you happen to mention me?

01:49:40.086 --> 01:49:42.442
You know, in a generalway.

01:49:43.307 --> 01:49:46.973
I have a feeling that he didn't know
what you were talking about.

01:49:47.235 --> 01:49:49.475
He's been very busy.
He doesn't concentrate.

01:49:49.704 --> 01:49:52.705
Of course, he's always been concentrating
with Margot. He's concentrate in it.

01:49:52.915 --> 01:49:56.669
I'm glad he is.
She's nice, very nice.

01:49:57.077 --> 01:49:59.420
- Honey, do you want me to tell him?
- Oh, no.

01:49:59.664 --> 01:50:01.790
If we're gonna get married Sunday,
somebody's got to...

01:50:02.010 --> 01:50:05.655
- No, I want to tell him.
- Well, there he is now.

01:50:05.876 --> 01:50:07.556
Go tell him!

01:50:08.969 --> 01:50:11.886
- Hello, boss.
- Hello, Goliath. You, winning?

01:50:12.135 --> 01:50:14.879
Oh, well...Not now.

01:50:15.120 --> 01:50:16.903
It looks he's in good mood.
He's laughing.

01:50:17.280 --> 01:50:21.042
No, I've have to get dressed.
I'll tell him later.

01:50:21.560 --> 01:50:26.389
- When, later?
- Just later.

01:50:27.360 --> 01:50:29.440
Just later!

01:50:40.644 --> 01:50:41.655
May I come in?

01:50:43.038 --> 01:50:45.387
Yes, I wish you would.

01:50:46.060 --> 01:50:50.280
Oh, lilac! How beautiful. I know
who they're from, Matt.

01:50:50.992 --> 01:50:52.622
Lilac are good luck.

01:50:52.776 --> 01:50:54.634
I hope so.

01:50:54.857 --> 01:50:56.690
Oh, beautiful!

01:50:58.142 --> 01:51:01.851
All right. Could I have it quiet,
please? Everybody here?

01:51:02.082 --> 01:51:04.714
Where's Toni? And Tojo?
Where is he?

01:51:04.980 --> 01:51:06.406
I'll get them in.

01:51:07.574 --> 01:51:09.816
Well, box it's finally here.

01:51:10.047 --> 01:51:12.022
It's a half hour to dress rehearsal.

01:51:12.411 --> 01:51:14.160
No breaks and no waits.

01:51:14.545 --> 01:51:17.593
I want the same performance
you're gonna give tonight.

01:51:18.505 --> 01:51:20.816
So, check your costumes
and your props

01:51:21.036 --> 01:51:23.513
- and pick up those music cues.
- Yes, sir.

01:51:23.753 --> 01:51:25.671
Now, are there any questions?

01:51:26.154 --> 01:51:29.371
All right. When I blow this whistle
for the Grand Parade,

01:51:29.768 --> 01:51:31.657
you're all on your own.

01:51:32.176 --> 01:51:36.019
You're a fine group of artists,
the best in the world.

01:51:36.243 --> 01:51:38.858
And I don't want you to forget
that for a minute.

01:51:39.230 --> 01:51:42.097
And also, ladies and gentlemen,
I want to thank you

01:51:42.635 --> 01:51:45.860
for the hard work that's made
this circus possible.

01:51:46.039 --> 01:51:50.580
So, break a leg,
let's get to it!

01:52:02.610 --> 01:52:05.731
I'm trying to get up enough
nerve to tell Matt

01:52:05.971 --> 01:52:08.447
that I'm getting married.
It's not that I'm afraid,

01:52:08.698 --> 01:52:11.523
but, well, I m all he has.

01:52:11.716 --> 01:52:15.000
He doesn't have a family
or anyone like that.

01:52:15.210 --> 01:52:17.903
And, he'll be alone when
I get married.

01:52:18.350 --> 01:52:21.448
Not really alone, but you know,
it won't be the same.

01:52:21.670 --> 01:52:25.189
Even if I'm still on the show.
You see what I mean?

01:52:25.684 --> 01:52:27.896
I understand, of course.

01:52:28.136 --> 01:52:31.059
Matt is very good.
Kind and sweet.

01:52:31.986 --> 01:52:34.020
And if he's short of loud
sometimes,

01:52:34.306 --> 01:52:37.297
it's just because he's full
of fun and he loves life.

01:52:38.142 --> 01:52:42.639
There've been a lot of women
after him for years but,

01:52:42.869 --> 01:52:45.265
none of them were right for
him, I guess.

01:52:46.450 --> 01:52:50.619
I think you are right, I mean.

01:52:52.996 --> 01:52:54.868
You do like him, don't you?

01:52:59.380 --> 01:53:01.331
What's the matter?

01:53:01.750 --> 01:53:03.068
Thirty minutes.

01:53:03.293 --> 01:53:07.369
Hey! You better get dressed or Matt will
put you back on the Stage Coach.

01:53:07.629 --> 01:53:10.533
I'm going.
Think about what I said.

01:53:10.967 --> 01:53:13.018
I will.

01:53:17.621 --> 01:53:19.300
What was that all about?

01:53:20.850 --> 01:53:24.446
She was trying to match me
with Matt.

01:53:28.250 --> 01:53:34.434
You know, Lili. You and Matt are digging
an awfully deep hole yourselves.

01:53:59.643 --> 01:54:00.824
Why can't the keep on cue?

01:54:00.957 --> 01:54:03.571
Last time it took them four minutes
to make that.

01:54:06.324 --> 01:54:08.160
Are your working here?

01:54:08.983 --> 01:54:10.802
Get into your costume!

01:54:16.401 --> 01:54:18.413
- Where was I?
- Four minutes!

01:54:18.625 --> 01:54:20.152
Take two out of it.

01:55:22.970 --> 01:55:23.898
Hi!

01:55:24.114 --> 01:55:26.058
I think we'd better work those
ponies in Number Three Ring.

01:55:26.209 --> 01:55:30.459
They're a little nervous working
around the kid.  - Right.

01:55:30.978 --> 01:55:32.243
Look at that!

01:55:32.673 --> 01:55:35.636
Look at that!
Is that my mother?

01:55:35.766 --> 01:55:38.729
Answer me, is she my mother?

01:55:39.706 --> 01:55:41.188
Yes, Toni.

01:55:41.570 --> 01:55:44.242
And this says my father killed
himself.

01:55:44.569 --> 01:55:48.652
He dived from the high trapeze and
left a note about my mother

01:55:48.885 --> 01:55:53.736
and another man.
Is that true? Is it true?

01:55:54.187 --> 01:55:55.675
It's true.

01:55:55.916 --> 01:56:01.142
You didn't tell me any of this.
Why? Tell me why!

01:56:02.010 --> 01:56:04.236
I'm the other man, Toni.

01:56:06.402 --> 01:56:07.917
It was me.

01:56:08.479 --> 01:56:10.822
You? Oh!

01:56:23.693 --> 01:56:26.384
If you told her that much, why
didn't you tell her the rest of it?

01:56:26.841 --> 01:56:30.799
Why didn't tell about her father
and how loyal Lili really was?

01:56:31.018 --> 01:56:33.229
What good would that have done?

01:56:38.832 --> 01:56:42.420
You, you sneak back and think
you can make me love you.

01:56:42.650 --> 01:56:45.240
- I only meant...
- You thought you'd trick me!

01:56:45.469 --> 01:56:47.000
But you didn't trick me, you see!

01:56:47.228 --> 01:56:48.960
I know, I know everything.

01:56:49.391 --> 01:56:52.161
-I know what you are
and what he is. -Toni!

01:56:52.722 --> 01:56:53.823
Toni, we only wanted...

01:56:54.043 --> 01:56:59.164
- You wanted Matt again, to roll around
in filth with him again!  -Toni!

01:56:59.386 --> 01:57:01.997
Well, here he is! Take him!

01:57:02.200 --> 01:57:05.098
Take him, made love to him!

01:57:05.325 --> 01:57:06.630
- Crawl on him!
- That's enough!

01:57:06.870 --> 01:57:11.138
It's not enough! You liars!
You killed, you killed my father!

01:57:11.497 --> 01:57:14.092
It would only be enough if
I kill both of you!

01:57:14.310 --> 01:57:16.858
Toni, grow up! Be a woman.

01:57:17.327 --> 01:57:20.209
Go to Steve! You wanted
to marry him.

01:57:20.430 --> 01:57:22.530
Go with him. Make a life
on your own!

01:57:22.999 --> 01:57:24.896
I hope it's a better one
than Lili's had.

01:57:25.577 --> 01:57:30.084
I hope she has no life at all!
Not now, not ever!

01:57:41.666 --> 01:57:43.479
Lili.

01:57:45.800 --> 01:57:47.648
Lili.

01:57:49.628 --> 01:57:53.991
We both said we could
take it, remember?

01:57:57.298 --> 01:57:59.203
The rehearsal.

01:58:04.250 --> 01:58:06.391
I'll be there.

01:58:15.000 --> 01:58:16.950
Be gentle. So just pack up and
let's get out of here.

01:58:17.070 --> 01:58:19.930
- What else could I do?
- You could use a little understand

01:58:20.171 --> 01:58:23.431
or realize that whoever planned
stop in here was doing everything

01:58:23.832 --> 01:58:26.032
in his power to make their love
look dirty.

01:58:27.040 --> 01:58:29.528
And I just don't believe it.

01:58:29.820 --> 01:58:31.921
But, you've known Matt
longer than I have.

01:58:32.144 --> 01:58:34.988
I've only known him for ten years.

01:58:38.390 --> 01:58:41.398
That's Parade Call.
You want to get ready?

01:58:41.626 --> 01:58:43.065
No!

01:58:43.305 --> 01:58:45.029
All right.

01:59:37.511 --> 01:59:43.380
Ladies and gentlemen,
we bring you our Circus!

01:59:43.655 --> 01:59:45.736
Maestro!

02:00:58.205 --> 02:01:00.217
Fire! Fire!

02:01:14.583 --> 02:01:16.100
- Gimme your knife.
- Matt, you can't do...

02:01:16.320 --> 02:01:18.791
I'm not gonna lose another
damn tent!

02:01:20.023 --> 02:01:22.369
Get those animals outta here!

02:01:42.744 --> 02:01:44.370
Lili! Lili!

02:01:50.645 --> 02:01:52.963
That part's gone,
is out of control.

02:01:53.192 --> 02:01:55.592
We gotta make a fire break
to save any of this tent.

02:01:55.831 --> 02:01:59.248
- Drop the canvas between two
and three poles.  - Right.

02:02:00.155 --> 02:02:02.464
I'll flatten these seats.

02:03:02.364 --> 02:03:04.535
- Matt!
- Oh, honey.

02:03:05.635 --> 02:03:09.551
Steve, give Cap a hand with that
fire break. Get Toni out of here!

02:03:09.672 --> 02:03:11.072
Go on!

02:03:11.980 --> 02:03:13.755
- Ready?
- Ready.

02:03:24.600 --> 02:03:26.492
Get the quarter poles!

02:03:27.000 --> 02:03:28.437
What do you have to do?

02:03:28.670 --> 02:03:31.439
I have to cut the lacing on poles
two and three.

02:03:31.700 --> 02:03:33.272
I can do that.

02:03:45.715 --> 02:03:47.756
Hey Cap, what can I do?

02:03:51.350 --> 02:03:53.138
Cut down those lights.

02:05:13.960 --> 02:05:15.839
Lili!

02:05:23.500 --> 02:05:24.740
Lili!

02:05:26.926 --> 02:05:28.471
Get out of here!

02:05:54.341 --> 02:05:55.972
Get back!

02:06:46.902 --> 02:06:50.127
Gimme a hand.
Help them with that canvas.

02:07:07.179 --> 02:07:11.259
Steve! Cut it and get out there!

02:07:54.715 --> 02:07:56.249
Thanks.

02:07:56.969 --> 02:07:59.714
I'm sorry, I'm so sorry.

02:08:00.800 --> 02:08:04.326
You know something?
You've got a dirty face.

02:08:07.636 --> 02:08:11.031
-Matt! It started in the wardrobe
caravan.  - Yeah.

02:08:11.360 --> 02:08:16.429
Well, we got a piece of tent,
a whole show and half an idea

02:08:16.624 --> 02:08:20.034
and if it works out this Circus
goes on... tonight!

02:08:20.380 --> 02:08:22.496
- Tonight? Are you out of your
mind? - Let me see that.

02:08:22.835 --> 02:08:25.984
- Let the doctor take a look at it.
- A show with this? Come on!

02:08:26.118 --> 02:08:28.766

It's a remarkable thing, Matt.
I hope I don't fail you.

02:15:23.361 --> 02:15:25.119
You couldn't.

02:15:25.554 --> 02:15:27.700
Toni, give her some of those
owl feathers.

02:15:28.000 --> 02:15:31.417

Something's happened.
Toni's quit!

02:18:10.459 --> 02:18:12.513
Nothing's happened.

02:18:14.614 --> 02:18:18.654
She knows what she's doing.
A wonderful kid.
