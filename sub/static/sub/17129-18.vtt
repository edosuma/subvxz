OUR DAUGHTER WAS AT A PARTY
YOU GUYS BROKE UP.

10:14.715 --> 10:16.383
OKAY, GIVE ME A MINUTE.

10:16.383 --> 10:17.350
THIS IS IT, ANGIE!

10:17.350 --> 10:18.285
GEORGE, CALM DOWN.

10:18.285 --> 10:19.853
I'M NOT GONNA CALM DOWN!

10:19.853 --> 10:21.789
I'M NOT JOKING THIS TIME!
I'M GONNA KILL HER!

10:25.258 --> 10:26.526
HE DOESN'T MEAN IT,
OFFICER.

10:26.526 --> 10:27.995
HE'S A LAW-ABIDING MAN.

10:27.995 --> 10:30.263
IN FACT, WHENEVER THERE'S
A BEATING ON THE NEWS,

10:30.263 --> 10:31.431
HE ALWAYS CHEERS
FOR YOUR SIDE.

10:31.431 --> 10:32.833
THAT'S RIGHT, MAN.

10:32.833 --> 10:34.501
I'M ALWAYS HAPPY WHEN
THE FAT COP SHOWS UP

10:34.501 --> 10:36.770
AND HE'S ALL TIRED
'CAUSE HE HAD TO HOP THE FENCE,

10:36.770 --> 10:38.005
AND HE'S...

10:38.005 --> 10:40.808
MAN,
THAT GUY SWINGS AWAY.

10:43.010 --> 10:43.811
THANK YOU, OFFICER.

10:43.811 --> 10:45.378
DRUGS, CARMEN?!

10:45.378 --> 10:48.048
NO, DAD, I CAN EXPLAIN.
I DIDN'T DO ANY DRUGS.

10:48.048 --> 10:50.117
LET ME GUESS --
YOU WERE AT THE PARTY,

10:50.117 --> 10:52.352
AND THE DRUGS
HAPPENED TO SHOW UP.
YES.

10:52.352 --> 10:54.955
IS THAT YOU TALKING,
OR THE MONKEY ON YOUR BACK?

10:54.955 --> 10:57.090
HOW MANY COLORS DO YOU SEE?
HUH, JUNKIE?

10:57.758 --> 11:00.728
GEORGE, STOP IT!

11:00.728 --> 11:02.262
GEORGE, STOP IT!

11:02.262 --> 11:05.398
CARMEN,
WHAT REALLY HAPPENED?

11:05.398 --> 11:07.367
WELL, A BUNCH OF GUYS
FROM ANOTHER SCHOOL CAME

11:07.367 --> 11:09.402
AND STARTED SMOKING POT,
AND THEN THE COPS CAME,

11:09.402 --> 11:11.304
AND NO ONE WOULD ADMIT
THE DRUGS WERE THEIRS,

11:11.304 --> 11:13.140
SO THEY BROUGHT US ALL IN
FOR QUESTIONING.

11:13.140 --> 11:15.475
OKAY, SWEETHEART.
YOU SHOULD'VE SAID THAT.

11:15.475 --> 11:16.409
NOW I BELIEVE YOU.

11:17.644 --> 11:20.280
HURTS, DON'T IT,
JUNKIE?!

11:20.280 --> 11:21.081
GEORGE!

11:21.081 --> 11:23.516
ANGIE,
HER PUPILS ARE HUGE!

11:23.516 --> 11:26.153
SHE HAS DARK BROWN EYES.
THAT'S THE WAY THEY ALWAYS LOOK.

11:26.153 --> 11:28.655
YOU MEAN THEY'RE
NOT GREEN?

11:28.655 --> 11:31.391
LOOK, I BELIEVE CARMEN.

11:31.391 --> 11:33.827
IF IT WASN'T TRUE,
THEY WOULDN'T BE LETTING HER GO.

11:33.827 --> 11:36.797
YEAH, WELL, SHE LIED TO US
AND WENT OVER TO JASON'S AGAIN.

11:36.797 --> 11:38.331
MAYBE THEY SHOULDN'T
LET HER GO.

11:38.331 --> 11:40.100
MAYBE WE SHOULD LEAVE HER
IN JAIL.

11:40.100 --> 11:42.569
THAT WAY, WE KNOW SHE'S NOT
HAVING SEX OR DOING DRUGS.

11:42.569 --> 11:45.572
[ CHUCKLING ]

11:45.572 --> 11:47.107
SORRY.

11:48.508 --> 11:51.344
IF YOU SIGN HERE, WE CAN
RELEASE HER INTO YOUR CUSTODY.

11:51.344 --> 11:53.346
EXCUSE ME, UM...

11:53.346 --> 11:55.816
WHEN IS JASON McNAMARA
GONNA BE RELEASED?

11:55.816 --> 11:58.185
HE'S NOT. HE'S A MINOR, AND HIS
PARENTS ARE OUT OF THE COUNTRY.

11:58.185 --> 11:59.719
WE HAVE NO ONE
TO RELEASE HIM TO.

11:59.719 --> 12:01.321
JASON CAN'T SPEND
THE NIGHT IN JAIL.

12:01.321 --> 12:03.824
I SPENT THE NIGHT IN JAIL ONCE.
NOTHING HAPPENED TO ME.

12:03.824 --> 12:06.326
IT'S NOT THE SAME, DAD.
JASON'S PRETTY!

12:12.732 --> 12:14.935
DAD,
YOU HAVE TO DO SOMETHING.

12:14.935 --> 12:17.838
OH, CAN MY PARENTS
SIGN FOR HIM?

12:17.838 --> 12:19.506
YES, BUT LEGALLY
HE'D BE THEIR RESPONSIBILITY

12:19.506 --> 12:21.474
UNTIL HE CAN BE
TURNED OVER TO HIS PARENTS.

12:21.474 --> 12:24.778
LET HIM STAY IN JAIL.
THAT'LL TEACH HIM A LESSON.

12:24.778 --> 12:26.079
COME ON, ANGIE, LET'S GO.

12:26.079 --> 12:28.015
WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN
TO HIM?

12:28.015 --> 12:29.783
WELL, IF THERE'S NO ONE
TO RELEASE HIM TO,

12:29.783 --> 12:31.584
HE'LL PROBABLY END UP
IN A GROUP HOME.

12:31.584 --> 12:32.752
DAD, A GROUP HOME!

12:32.752 --> 12:35.322
CARMEN, THAT SOUNDS
LIKE FUN.

12:36.857 --> 12:39.492
BUNK BEDS, SING-ALONGS.

12:39.492 --> 12:41.862
* DRIVE-BYS ARE BAD

12:41.862 --> 12:43.696
COME ON, MAKING A QUILT
WITH THE NAMES

12:43.696 --> 12:45.098
OF YOUR FALLEN HOMIES.

12:45.098 --> 12:47.935
"GIVE ME A SEQUIN SO I CAN
PUT A TEARDROP ON SPIDER."

12:49.669 --> 12:51.972
YOU KNOW, GEORGE,
IF SOMETHING HAPPENS TO JASON,

12:51.972 --> 12:53.740
WE'LL NEVER FORGIVE OURSELVES.

12:53.740 --> 12:57.777
LET'S JUST TAKE HIM HOME TONIGHT
AND WE WILL CALL HIS PARENTS.

12:57.777 --> 12:59.279
PLEASE, DAD?

13:01.614 --> 13:04.084
ALL RIGHT, I'LL SIGN.
GOD.

13:05.919 --> 13:08.255
HEY, MY MOM GOT ARRESTED
BY AN OFFICER MILLER.

13:08.255 --> 13:10.858
IS HE HERE, BECAUSE HE
FRISKED HER OR SOMETHING,

13:10.858 --> 13:13.093
AND SHE WANTED ME
TO GET HIS PHONE NUMBER.

13:19.166 --> 13:20.433
GIVE ME YOUR PARENTS'
PHONE NUMBER.

13:21.634 --> 13:24.037
AND YOU -- I'LL DEAL WITH
YOUR PUNISHMENT LATER.

13:24.037 --> 13:27.074
YOU EVER BEEN TIED
TO A LEMON TREE?

13:32.612 --> 13:34.882
THIS IS WHERE YOU CAN
REACH THEM IN SWITZERLAND.

13:34.882 --> 13:36.149
I'LL CALL THEM.

13:38.785 --> 13:40.820
SO, HOW WAS DINNER?

13:40.820 --> 13:43.123
'CAUSE MINE WAS GREAT.

13:43.123 --> 13:45.058
GRANDMA PASSED OUT
ON THE COUCH,

13:45.058 --> 13:46.960
AND I ATE A CAN
OF FROSTING.

13:49.729 --> 13:51.064
MAX, WE DIDN'T GO
TO DINNER.

13:51.064 --> 13:52.699
WHILE YOU WERE CHANGING
YOUR SHIRT,

13:52.699 --> 13:55.135
THE POLICE CALLED, AND WE HAD
TO PICK UP CARMEN AND JASON.

13:55.135 --> 13:57.971
NO WAY!
YOU GOT ARRESTED?

13:57.971 --> 13:59.940
WHAT DID YOU DO?

13:59.940 --> 14:01.708
ACTUALLY,
GOVERNOR SCHWARZENEGGER

14:01.708 --> 14:03.176
JUST PASSED A NEW LAW.

14:03.176 --> 14:05.778
IT'S NOW A CRIME IN
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA

14:05.778 --> 14:07.314
TO LIE TO YOUR PARENTS.

14:11.284 --> 14:14.888
ANYTHING YOU WANT
TO TELL ME, MAX?

14:14.888 --> 14:16.890
MAX?

14:18.725 --> 14:20.860
I'VE BEEN SHRINKING
CARMEN'S CLOTHES IN THE DRYER

14:20.860 --> 14:23.030
SO SHE THINKS
SHE'S FAT.

14:28.735 --> 14:29.802
THAT'S HORRIBLE!

14:29.802 --> 14:33.006
[ Laughs ] YOU BAD B--

14:33.006 --> 14:35.508
GO TO YOUR ROOM,
BAD BOY!

14:39.112 --> 14:41.014
YOUR DAD
WANTS TO TALK TO YOU.

14:42.515 --> 14:43.816
HELLO?

14:43.816 --> 14:45.518
WHAT DID THEY SAY?

14:45.518 --> 14:46.987
THEY'RE NOT COMING BACK,

14:46.987 --> 14:49.789
AND THEY DON'T TRUST HIM
TO STAY ALONE ANYMORE.

14:49.789 --> 14:51.258
THEY'RE GONNA
WIRE US MONEY

14:51.258 --> 14:53.026
SO WE CAN SEND HIM
TO SWITZERLAND.

14:53.026 --> 14:55.528
NO, JASON CAN'T LEAVE.
I'LL NEVER SEE HIM AGAIN.

14:55.528 --> 14:57.931
HEY, IF THEY SEND HIM MONEY
FOR FIRST CLASS,

14:57.931 --> 14:59.532
WE'LL SEND HIM BACK COACH.

14:59.532 --> 15:01.234
WA-CHA.

15:02.869 --> 15:05.338
I KNOW, DAD.

15:05.338 --> 15:07.340
I'M SORRY.

15:07.340 --> 15:10.043
BUT IF I LEAVE,
THE SCOUTS WON'T SEE ME PLAY.

15:10.043 --> 15:12.079
I MIGHT NOT GET
THIS CHANCE AGAIN.

15:12.079 --> 15:15.515
PLEASE.

15:15.515 --> 15:17.684
ALL RIGHT.

15:20.520 --> 15:21.888
THIS ISN'T FAIR.

15:21.888 --> 15:23.991
JASON'S WHOLE LIFE
SHOULDN'T BE RUINED

15:23.991 --> 15:25.625
BECAUSE OF ONE STUPID PARTY.

15:25.625 --> 15:28.495
WHY CAN'T HE STAY WITH US
UNTIL THE SEASON'S OVER?

15:28.495 --> 15:31.431
YOU KNOW,
THAT'S A GREAT IDEA!

15:33.233 --> 15:36.569
YOU GUYS CAN SLEEP
IN THE SAME BED.

15:39.039 --> 15:41.174
AND I CAN GET YOU ONE
OF THOSE SPECIAL LIGHTS

15:41.174 --> 15:44.277
SO YOU CAN GROWN POT
IN THE CLOSET.

15:46.346 --> 15:49.182
MOM, IF JASON MOVES
THAT FAR AWAY, I'LL DIE.

15:49.182 --> 15:51.618
YOU SAID THE SAME THING
WHEN NSYNC BROKE UP,

15:51.618 --> 15:53.653
BUT LOOK, YOU'RE FINE.

15:55.555 --> 15:59.259
AND SO ARE JUSTIN, LANCE,
JOEY, CHRIS, AND J.C.

16:00.727 --> 16:03.296
WHATEVER THEIR NAMES ARE.

16:05.232 --> 16:07.267
LET ME TALK TO YOUR DAD
FOR A MINUTE.

16:07.267 --> 16:09.036
COME ON, ANGIE.

16:09.036 --> 16:10.603
DON'T EVEN START.
PLEASE!

16:10.603 --> 16:13.773
IT WOULD ONLY BE UNTIL
BASEBALL SEASON'S OVER.

16:13.773 --> 16:15.742
I'M NOT GONNA HAVE MY
16-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER

16:15.742 --> 16:17.844
AND HER BOYFRIEND LIVING
UNDER THE SAME ROOF.

16:17.844 --> 16:20.113
GEORGE, KEEP IN MIND HE'S GOING
TO BE EXPOSED

16:20.113 --> 16:22.015
TO SIDES OF CARMEN
HE'S NEVER SEEN --

16:22.015 --> 16:24.084
CRANKY CARMEN,
MOODY CARMEN,

16:24.084 --> 16:26.086
MORNING-BREATH CARMEN.

16:26.086 --> 16:27.354
HI.

16:27.354 --> 16:29.989
OOPS.

16:29.989 --> 16:31.691
YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT IT'S LIKE

16:31.691 --> 16:34.227
TO BE A TEENAGE BOY
WITH RAGING HORMONES.

16:34.227 --> 16:35.828
WHEN I WAS A FRESHMAN
IN HIGH SCHOOL,

16:35.828 --> 16:37.930
WE HAD THIS GIRL,
A FOREIGN EXCHANGE STUDENT.

16:37.930 --> 16:40.367
HER NAME WAS FLEXPA.

16:41.834 --> 16:43.303
DIDN'T SHAVE, DIDN'T WASH.

16:43.303 --> 16:45.738
SHE HAD A MOLE THE SIZE
OF A QUARTER ON HER FOREHEAD.

16:45.738 --> 16:49.242
IT LOOKED LIKE A BUMBLEBEE
LANDED, LIKE [BUZZES].

16:49.242 --> 16:50.810
AND ONE DAY IN THE HALL,

16:50.810 --> 16:53.546
SHE PASSED ME AND SHE FLASHED
THIS BIG, CHEESY, YELLOW SMILE,

16:53.546 --> 16:55.415
AND I THOUGHT TO MYSELF,
"SABES QUE.

16:55.415 --> 16:57.250
IT'S ON!

16:57.250 --> 17:00.653
YOU WERE A PIG BACK THEN.

17:00.653 --> 17:02.755
YOU'RE MISSING THE POINT, ANGIE!
SHE WAS THE PIG.

17:02.755 --> 17:05.291
I WAS A NORMAL TEENAGE BOY.
HE'S NOT STAYING HERE.

17:05.291 --> 17:09.128
GEORGE, YOU DIDN'T TALK
TO HIS DAD.

17:09.128 --> 17:11.498
HE SAID, "I GUESS WE'LL
HAVE TO TAKE HIM BACK,

17:11.498 --> 17:13.500
LIKE HE DIDN'T EVEN CARE
ABOUT JASON.

17:13.500 --> 17:15.801
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT, ANGIE,
THAT'S NOT OUR PROBLEM.

17:15.801 --> 17:17.069
YOU KNOW WHAT CARMEN TOLD ME?

17:17.069 --> 17:18.971
THAT EVEN WHEN HIS PARENTS
DID LIVE HERE,

17:18.971 --> 17:20.440
THEY NEVER WENT TO ANY
OF HIS GAMES.

17:20.440 --> 17:22.942
THEY'RE NOT INVOLVED
IN HIS LIFE.

17:22.942 --> 17:24.711
IT'S LIKE
HE'S RAISING HIMSELF.

17:24.711 --> 17:28.047
DOES THAT SOUND FAMILIAR?

17:28.047 --> 17:29.716
WHAT?

17:29.716 --> 17:32.219
HOW THE HELL CAN YOU COMPARE
MY CHILDHOOD TO THIS RICH KID'S?

17:32.219 --> 17:33.820
HE'S HAD EVERYTHING
HANDED TO HIM.

17:33.820 --> 17:35.222
YOU SAW HIS HOUSE!

17:35.222 --> 17:38.825
THEY GOT A STATUE OF A NAKED BOY
PEEING IN THE POOL.

17:41.027 --> 17:43.029
THAT'S MONEY, ANGIE.
THAT'S CLASS.

17:43.029 --> 17:45.298
HE'S LIKE THAT, "HELLO."

17:51.404 --> 17:56.042
WELL,
IT MAY BE A BIGGER HOUSE,

17:56.042 --> 17:59.078
BUT HE'S STILL ALONE IN IT.

18:03.116 --> 18:04.584
[ SIGHS ]

18:04.584 --> 18:06.253
[ GROANS ]

18:07.854 --> 18:09.556
CAN HE STAY?
CARMEN, GO INSIDE.

18:09.556 --> 18:12.292
BUT, DAD --
I DON'T WANT TO HEAR IT.
GO INSIDE.

18:15.895 --> 18:19.199
I DON'T WANT YOU LIVING IN THE
SAME HOUSE AS MY DAUGHTER.

18:19.199 --> 18:21.668
I UNDERSTAND.

18:21.668 --> 18:25.004
GOD, I CAN'T BELIEVE
I SCREWED EVERYTHING UP.

18:25.004 --> 18:28.408
THERE GOES MY DREAM OF EVER
PLAYING IN THE MAJORS.

18:28.408 --> 18:30.210
YOU KNOW,
WHEN I WAS YOUR AGE,

18:30.210 --> 18:32.645
I USED TO DREAM ABOUT PLAYING
PRO BASEBALL.

18:32.645 --> 18:36.216
THIS IS DIFFERENT, MR. LOPEZ.
I'M ACTUALLY GOOD.

18:42.789 --> 18:44.291
I WAS GOOD, TOO.

18:44.291 --> 18:46.226
ONE TIME,
BOTTOM OF THE NINTH INNING,

18:46.226 --> 18:48.228
BASES LOADED,
I DROVE IN THE WINNING RUN.

18:48.228 --> 18:50.096
THEY EVEN CARRIED ME OFF
THE FIELD.

18:50.096 --> 18:51.498
YOU HIT A GRAND SLAM?

18:51.498 --> 18:54.100
NO, I LEANED INTO A PITCH
AND TOOK ONE IN THE HEAD.

18:54.100 --> 18:57.170
I GOT MY FIRST KISS
THAT DAY.

18:57.170 --> 18:58.738
THE PARAMEDIC SAID
IT WAS JUST CPR,

18:58.738 --> 19:01.608
BUT SHE DIDN'T FIGHT
THE TONGUE.

19:08.248 --> 19:11.083
IT DOESN'T MATTER NOW ANYWAY.

19:11.083 --> 19:12.685
BASEBALL'S OVER FOR ME.

19:12.685 --> 19:15.755
I'M GONNA GO HANG OUT WITH
CARMEN WHILE I STILL CAN.

19:19.259 --> 19:20.760
TELL YOU WHAT.

19:24.297 --> 19:27.667
I'LL MAKE YOU A DEAL.

19:27.667 --> 19:30.837
YOU CAN STAY FOR THE REST
OF BASEBALL SEASON

19:30.837 --> 19:33.640
IF YOU CAN KNOCK A CAN
OFF THE FENCE.

19:36.309 --> 19:37.644
ARE YOU SERIOUS?
YEP.

19:37.644 --> 19:39.212
I'LL EVEN CALL YOUR PARENTS
IN SWITZERLAND

19:39.212 --> 19:40.480
AND TELL THEM YOU'RE STAYING.

19:40.480 --> 19:42.749
ALL YOU GOT TO DO
IS KNOCK OFF THAT CAN.

19:56.296 --> 19:58.965
OKAY, THAT SUCKED.

20:00.967 --> 20:04.371
YODEL-ODEL-LAY-EE-HOO!

20:06.939 --> 20:11.544
I'M GONNA LET YOU STAY HERE
SO YOU CAN WORK ON YOUR CONTROL.

OH!

THANKS, MR. LOPEZ!

20:16.349 --> 20:19.185
I PROMISE I WILL NOT
SCREW THIS UP.

20:19.185 --> 20:21.821
I'M GONNA GO TELL CARMEN.

20:21.821 --> 20:23.290

20:40.940 --> 20:43.175
I'M SO GLAD YOUR DAD'S
LETTING ME STAY HERE.

20:43.175 --> 20:45.945
I KNOW.
IT'S GONNA BE GREAT.

20:45.945 --> 20:48.180
WHEN I GO TO BED,
YOU'LL BE HERE.
