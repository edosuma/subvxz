00:49.033 --> 00:52.970
<i>Long ago,
the world was full of wonder.</i>

00:59.210 --> 01:01.045
<i>It was adventurous...</i>

01:02.814 --> 01:04.048
<i>exciting...</i>

01:06.349 --> 01:08.318
<i>and best of all...</i>

01:08.786 --> 01:10.453
<i>there was magic.</i>

01:11.923 --> 01:13.791
<i>Boombastia!</i>

01:23.400 --> 01:26.836
<i>And that magic
helped all in need.</i>

01:26.838 --> 01:28.438
<i>Flame Infernar!</i>

01:38.049 --> 01:39.851
<i>Voltar Thundasir!</i>

01:54.598 --> 01:57.699
<i>But it wasn't
easy to master.</i>

01:57.701 --> 02:00.668
<i>And so the world found
a simpler way to get by.</i>

02:00.670 --> 02:03.573
I call it the light bulb.

02:10.380 --> 02:12.382
'Tis so easy.

02:12.984 --> 02:14.049
Huh.

02:17.454 --> 02:18.688
<i>Over time...</i>

02:20.590 --> 02:22.525
<i>...magic faded away.</i>

02:41.279 --> 02:42.479
<i>But I hope...</i>

02:46.951 --> 02:49.153
<i>...there's a little
magic left...</i>

02:50.720 --> 02:51.721
<i>in you.</i>

03:12.442 --> 03:13.776
<i>All right.</i>

03:13.778 --> 03:15.743
<i>We're gonna get
Warrior Z90 fit.</i>

03:15.745 --> 03:18.013
<i>Let me hear you say,
"I'm a mighty warrior."</i>

03:18.015 --> 03:19.248
I'm a mighty warrior.

03:19.250 --> 03:20.816
Morning, Mom.

03:23.486 --> 03:25.520
Oh! Blazey, down!

03:25.522 --> 03:28.059
Bad dragon!
Back to your lair.

03:29.160 --> 03:31.894
Happy birthday,
Mr. Adult Man.

03:31.896 --> 03:33.028
No, Mom.

03:33.030 --> 03:35.900
Hey, buddy. Don't wipe off
my kisses.

03:36.233 --> 03:37.299
What?

03:37.301 --> 03:39.435
You're wearing
your dad's sweatshirt.

03:39.437 --> 03:41.703
Oh. You know.
Finally fits.

03:41.705 --> 03:44.139
Aw, my little chubby cheeks
is all grown up!

03:44.141 --> 03:47.376
Okay, okay. Mom, I gotta eat
something before school.

03:47.378 --> 03:48.777
Ah, we don't have
much food.

03:48.779 --> 03:50.446
I still have to go
to the grocery store.

03:50.448 --> 03:51.814
Ah, hands off, mister.

03:51.816 --> 03:53.449
Those are
for your party tonight.

03:53.451 --> 03:55.683
It's not a party, Mom.
It's just us.

03:55.685 --> 03:57.753
You could invite those kids
from your science class.

03:57.755 --> 03:59.888
You said they seem
pretty rockin'.

03:59.890 --> 04:02.291
I'm, uh, pretty sure
I didn't say it like that.

04:02.293 --> 04:03.959
And besides,
I don't even know them.

04:03.961 --> 04:06.395
Well, your birthday's a day
to try new things.

04:06.397 --> 04:07.963
Be the new you.

04:07.965 --> 04:09.564
Speaking of
trying new things,

04:09.566 --> 04:11.333
did you sign up
for driving practice?

04:11.335 --> 04:12.868
No!
No.

04:12.870 --> 04:15.603
I know you're a little scared to
drive, sweetie pie, but...

04:15.605 --> 04:18.240
I'm not scared, Mom.
I'm gonna move Barley's game.

04:18.242 --> 04:20.541
Okay, but you know
how he gets when someone

04:20.543 --> 04:21.944
touches that board.

04:21.946 --> 04:24.480
Well, he's gotta learn
how to clean up his toys.

04:24.482 --> 04:25.680
Halt!

04:25.682 --> 04:29.686
Doth my brother dare disrupt
an active campaign?

04:30.187 --> 04:31.387
Oh, come on!

04:31.389 --> 04:32.520
You know, Ian,

04:32.522 --> 04:33.721
in the days of old,
a boy of 16

04:33.723 --> 04:35.190
would have
his strength tested

04:35.192 --> 04:36.624
in the Swamps of Despair.

04:36.626 --> 04:38.626
I'm not testing anything.
Just let me go.

04:38.628 --> 04:39.694
Let him go.

04:39.696 --> 04:40.796
Okay.

04:40.798 --> 04:41.930
But I know you're
stronger than that.

04:41.932 --> 04:43.731
There's a mighty warrior
inside of you.

04:43.733 --> 04:45.167
You just have to
let him out.

04:45.169 --> 04:46.601
Right, Mom?

04:46.603 --> 04:47.870
Oh, that's good.

04:47.872 --> 04:49.838
Barley! You stink!

04:49.840 --> 04:51.140
When was the last time
you showered?

04:51.142 --> 04:52.875
If you tried a little
harder, you actually could

04:52.877 --> 04:54.943
probably wiggle out of this.

04:54.945 --> 04:58.380
See? Mom knows how
to let out her inner warrior.

04:58.382 --> 04:59.515
Thank you.

04:59.517 --> 05:00.751
Now, take out
the trash.

05:03.720 --> 05:05.553
<i>Stay on the
lookout for a runaway griffin.</i>

05:05.555 --> 05:07.688
Ah, Officer Bronco.

05:07.690 --> 05:10.025
Barley, Barley, Barley.

05:10.027 --> 05:11.827
Every time the city tries
to tear down

05:11.829 --> 05:13.162
an old piece of rubble,

05:13.164 --> 05:15.831
I gotta drag my rear end
out here and deal with you.

05:15.833 --> 05:18.100
I don't know
what you're talking about.

05:18.102 --> 05:19.535
Oh, really?

05:19.537 --> 05:22.071
<i>I will not let you
tear down this fountain.</i>

05:22.073 --> 05:24.739
<i>Ancient warriors
on grand quests</i>

05:24.741 --> 05:26.741
<i>drank from its
flowing water.</i>

05:28.079 --> 05:28.944
Barley.

05:28.946 --> 05:30.813
They're destroying
the town's past.

05:30.815 --> 05:32.314
Ugh. Well,
come on in.

05:32.316 --> 05:33.714
Rest your haunches
for a minute.

05:33.716 --> 05:35.019
Thank you, hon.

05:35.920 --> 05:36.921
Ugh.

05:38.289 --> 05:39.988
Hey there,
birthday boy.

05:39.990 --> 05:43.125
So, ya workin' hard
or hardly workin'?

05:43.127 --> 05:45.494
I'm just, you know,
making toast.

05:45.496 --> 05:46.727
I'm serious, Barley,

05:46.729 --> 05:48.530
you need to start thinking
less about the past

05:48.532 --> 05:50.399
and more about
your future.

05:50.401 --> 05:51.936
Ah, she's right.

05:53.804 --> 05:55.940
You can't spend all day
playing your board game.

05:57.640 --> 06:00.109
<i>Quests of Yore</i>
isn't just a board game.

06:00.111 --> 06:03.512
It's a historically-based
role-playing scenario.

06:03.514 --> 06:04.745
Did you know,
in the old days,

06:04.747 --> 06:07.682
centaurs could run
70 miles an hour?

06:07.684 --> 06:09.485
I own a vehicle.
Don't need to run.

06:09.487 --> 06:10.953
Well, Ian,
you could definitely

06:10.955 --> 06:12.488
learn a lot
from <i>Quests of Yore.</i>

06:12.490 --> 06:13.889
- You wanna play?
- I don't.

06:13.891 --> 06:15.457
You could be
a crafty rogue or...

06:15.459 --> 06:18.693
Ooh! I know!
You can be a wizard.

06:18.695 --> 06:20.596
I shall cast a spell
on thee!

06:20.598 --> 06:21.964
Hey! Careful of
Dad's sweatshirt!

06:21.966 --> 06:24.299
I don't even remember Dad
wearing that sweatshirt.

06:24.301 --> 06:27.302
Well, you do only have,
like, two memories of him.

06:27.304 --> 06:28.170
No, I've got three.

06:28.172 --> 06:29.905
I remember
his beard was scratchy,

06:29.907 --> 06:31.639
he had a goofy laugh,
and I used to play

06:31.641 --> 06:33.308
- drums on his feet.
- Drums on his feet. Right.

06:33.310 --> 06:34.443
I used to go...

06:36.413 --> 06:38.149
- Whoa!
- Five-second rule. Hah!

06:39.617 --> 06:40.681
It's okay.
You just got to pull it.

06:40.683 --> 06:41.919
No!

06:42.219 --> 06:43.220
Barley!

06:44.121 --> 06:45.320
Uh, you know...

06:45.322 --> 06:47.556
I'm just gonna get some
food on the way to school.

06:47.558 --> 06:49.391
I'll sew that
later tonight, okay?

06:49.393 --> 06:50.592
Wait, wait, wait.

06:50.594 --> 06:53.562
By the laws of yore,
I must dub thee a man today.

06:53.564 --> 06:54.662
Kneel before me.

06:54.664 --> 06:56.899
Oh! That's okay.
I gotta get going.

06:56.901 --> 06:58.066
All right, well,
I'll pick you up later.

06:58.068 --> 06:59.334
We'll perform
the ceremony at school.

06:59.336 --> 07:00.269
Oh! No, no, no, no.

07:00.271 --> 07:02.106
Don't do that.
Don't do that. Okay, bye!

07:15.152 --> 07:16.218
Hey!

07:16.220 --> 07:17.286
Go Griffins!

07:17.288 --> 07:18.153
What?

07:18.155 --> 07:19.588
You go to
Willowdale College?

07:19.590 --> 07:21.689
Oh, no.
This was my dad's.

07:21.691 --> 07:24.393
Lightfoot?
Wilden Lightfoot?

07:24.395 --> 07:25.460
Yeah.

07:25.462 --> 07:27.229
You're kidding.
I went to college with him.

07:27.231 --> 07:29.331
- Really?
- Yeah.

07:29.333 --> 07:33.003
Boy, I was so sorry to hear
that he passed away.

07:33.470 --> 07:35.103
Yeah. Thanks.

07:35.105 --> 07:39.208
You know, your dad was
a great guy. So confident.

07:39.210 --> 07:42.411
When he came into a room,
people noticed.

07:42.413 --> 07:46.081
The man wore the ugliest
purple socks every single day.

07:46.083 --> 07:47.082
What? Why?

07:47.084 --> 07:49.184
Hey, that's exactly
what we asked.

07:49.186 --> 07:50.919
But he was just bold.

07:50.921 --> 07:54.156
I always wished I had
a little bit of that in me.

07:54.158 --> 07:58.994
Yeah. Wow. I've never heard
any of this about him before.

07:58.996 --> 08:01.029
- What else do you remember?
- Dad!

08:01.031 --> 08:03.699
Oh, sorry. Gotta get
this guy off to school.

08:03.701 --> 08:05.767
Hey, it was nice
meeting you.

08:05.769 --> 08:07.938
Yeah. You, too.

08:09.473 --> 08:10.474
Huh.

08:11.741 --> 08:13.077
Bold.

08:57.521 --> 09:00.024
Okay, class.
Sit down. We're starting roll.

09:07.064 --> 09:09.164
Hey, uh, Gorgamon. Um...

09:09.166 --> 09:12.167
Would you mind not putting
your feet on my chair today?

09:12.169 --> 09:13.068
Sorry, dude.

09:13.070 --> 09:14.303
Got to keep
them elevated.

09:14.305 --> 09:16.038
Gets the blood flowing
to my brain.

09:16.040 --> 09:19.174
It just makes it a little
hard for me to fit in there.

09:19.176 --> 09:20.742
Well, if I don't have
good blood flow,

09:20.744 --> 09:22.779
I can't concentrate
on my schoolwork.

09:22.781 --> 09:25.347
You don't want me to do bad
in school, do you?

09:25.349 --> 09:27.017
Uh...

09:27.451 --> 09:28.886
No.

09:29.320 --> 09:30.487
Thanks, bro.

09:34.224 --> 09:35.792
First road test.

09:35.794 --> 09:37.027
Any volunteers?

09:40.731 --> 09:42.232
A left here.

09:44.068 --> 09:46.937
Now, take this on-ramp
for the freeway.

09:48.072 --> 09:51.041
Okay, yeah. I'm, uh,
super ready for that.

09:54.645 --> 09:55.946
Uh...

09:57.081 --> 09:58.781
It's nice and fast.

09:58.783 --> 09:59.948
Just merge into traffic.

09:59.950 --> 10:01.516
Yep. Just any minute.

10:01.518 --> 10:02.617
- Merge into traffic.
- Uh...

10:02.619 --> 10:03.685
Merge into traffic!

10:04.922 --> 10:06.388
I'm not ready!

10:06.390 --> 10:07.389
Pull over.

10:11.362 --> 10:13.830
All right. So, what should
we do this weekend?

10:13.832 --> 10:15.030
Move to a cooler town?

10:15.032 --> 10:16.331
Oh, hey.
What up, dudes? Um...

10:16.333 --> 10:18.333
I'm, uh, having
a party tonight,

10:18.335 --> 10:20.770
and I was wondering if
you wanted to come over

10:20.772 --> 10:23.004
and get down
on some cake.

10:23.006 --> 10:25.107
That's not
something anyone says.

10:25.109 --> 10:27.311
Okay, don't say "dudes."
"Gang"?

10:28.813 --> 10:30.479
What's up, gang?

10:30.481 --> 10:32.447
What's up, gang?

10:36.788 --> 10:38.086
Hey.
What's up, gang?

10:38.088 --> 10:40.689
Oh, hey.
Uh, Ian, right?

10:40.691 --> 10:43.425
Oh! I didn't know
you knew my...

10:43.427 --> 10:44.993
Anyway...

10:44.995 --> 10:47.028
uh, if you like parties,
then I'm...

10:47.030 --> 10:48.463
I was gonna
do a party...

10:48.465 --> 10:49.998
- What?
- What I was trying to say is

10:50.000 --> 10:51.400
if you're not doing
anything tonight...

10:51.402 --> 10:53.735
but I'm sure you probably
are doing something tonight...

10:53.737 --> 10:55.670
and you like cake
like I like cake,

10:55.672 --> 10:58.206
I've got a cake
at my house.

10:58.208 --> 11:00.575
Are you inviting us
to a party?

11:00.577 --> 11:01.543
That's the one.

11:01.545 --> 11:03.578
Oh. Yeah,
we don't have any plans.

11:03.580 --> 11:04.646
- Yeah, okay.
- Totally.

11:04.648 --> 11:05.947
Really?

11:05.949 --> 11:07.716
I guess we can just take
the bus over to my house.

11:10.954 --> 11:12.154
Oh, no, no, no.

11:12.156 --> 11:15.592
Ha-ha! Is that
the birthday boy I see?

11:19.596 --> 11:22.197
Behold!
Your chariot awaits!

11:22.199 --> 11:23.698
Do you know that guy?

11:23.700 --> 11:26.368
- Uh...
- Sir Iandore of Lightfoot.

11:26.370 --> 11:28.570
Seems like he's
talking to you.

11:28.572 --> 11:29.671
Hey, Ian!

11:31.608 --> 11:33.074
Hey, Barley.

11:33.076 --> 11:35.010
Yeah, we were actually
gonna take the bus.

11:35.012 --> 11:36.913
The bus? Nay!

11:36.915 --> 11:38.781
I will give you
and your companions

11:38.783 --> 11:40.982
transport upon Guinevere.

11:40.984 --> 11:42.785
Um, who's Guinevere?

11:42.787 --> 11:44.953
My mighty steed.

11:44.955 --> 11:47.222
Oh. That's embarrassing.

11:47.224 --> 11:49.224
That's okay, girl.
Patch you back up.

11:50.194 --> 11:52.060
He's just joking around.

11:52.062 --> 11:54.498
You've got
something on your face.

11:55.532 --> 11:59.102
Oh, no. You... just...
Wait, no. It's... No...

11:59.871 --> 12:01.069
Oh! Uh...

12:01.071 --> 12:02.170
You know what?
I just remembered

12:02.172 --> 12:03.806
that my birthday
is, uh, canceled.

12:03.808 --> 12:05.207
- What?
- I mean, the party.

12:05.209 --> 12:06.809
Uh, it was never
actually happening.

12:06.811 --> 12:08.510
It was just this
huge misunderstanding.

12:08.512 --> 12:09.678
So, I got to go.

12:09.680 --> 12:11.048
Okay. Bye!

12:17.956 --> 12:21.824
Ooh. Whoops! Sorry.
Let me just file those.

12:22.961 --> 12:24.927
Hey, did those kids
write on your face?

12:24.929 --> 12:26.428
Here. I'll get it.

12:26.430 --> 12:28.730
Can we please
just go home?

12:28.732 --> 12:31.700
Okay, well, we'll perform
your birthday ceremony later.

12:31.702 --> 12:33.034
Then you'll be ready
for adulthood

12:33.036 --> 12:34.736
and its gauntlet
of challenges.

12:34.738 --> 12:35.872
You know,
in ancient times,

12:35.874 --> 12:37.038
you celebrated
your day of birth

12:37.040 --> 12:38.507
with a solemn quest.

12:38.509 --> 12:41.076
Of course, those were nothing
compared to the challenges

12:41.078 --> 12:42.613
of the old days.

12:46.784 --> 12:48.018
Mom?

12:48.887 --> 12:50.187
Mom?

13:34.832 --> 13:37.399
<i>Will, you're not gonna
get that thing working.</i>

13:37.401 --> 13:38.567
<i>I think I've got it.</i>

13:38.569 --> 13:40.135
<i>I'm gonna watch
from over here</i>

13:40.137 --> 13:42.237
<i>for when it blows up.</i>

13:42.239 --> 13:43.572
<i>Hello? Hello?</i>

13:43.574 --> 13:45.273
<i>I'll bet good money
you can't get it to work.</i>

13:45.275 --> 13:46.541
<i>Oh, is that right?</i>

13:46.543 --> 13:47.409
<i>Yep.</i>

13:47.411 --> 13:48.610
<i>But you're
doing a good job of</i>

13:48.612 --> 13:50.245
<i>making it look like
you know what you're doing.</i>

13:50.247 --> 13:52.014
<i>Well, I'm trying to.</i>

13:52.016 --> 13:53.849
<i>Did you check
if it had batteries?</i>

13:55.118 --> 13:56.184
<i>Of course you didn't.</i>

13:56.186 --> 13:57.252
<i>I know.</i>

13:57.254 --> 13:58.386
<i>So, is it really working?</i>

13:58.388 --> 13:59.623
<i>Let's find out.</i>

14:00.457 --> 14:02.157
<i>Okay. Bye.</i>

14:06.931 --> 14:09.364
<i>Will, you're not going
to get that thing working.</i>

14:09.366 --> 14:10.498
<i>I think I've got it.</i>

14:10.500 --> 14:12.233
<i>I'm gonna watch
from over here</i>

14:12.235 --> 14:13.970
<i>for when it blows up.</i>

14:13.972 --> 14:15.170
Hi, Dad.

14:15.172 --> 14:16.872
<i>Hello? Hello?</i>

14:16.874 --> 14:17.940
It's me, Ian.

14:17.942 --> 14:19.008
<i>Oh, is that right?</i>

14:19.010 --> 14:21.276
Yeah. Did you
have a good day?

14:21.278 --> 14:22.979
<i>Well, I'm trying to.</i>

14:22.981 --> 14:24.579
Yeah. Me, too.

14:24.581 --> 14:27.148
Although, I could clearly use some help.

14:28.987 --> 14:32.153
I sure do wish I could spend
the day with you sometime.

14:32.155 --> 14:33.388
<i>I know.</i>

14:33.390 --> 14:35.123
Well, there are so many
things we could do.

14:35.125 --> 14:36.993
I bet it'd be really fun.

14:36.995 --> 14:38.159
<i>Let's find out.</i>

14:38.161 --> 14:40.261
Yeah. I mean, I'd love to.
We could, uh...

14:40.263 --> 14:42.733
<i>Okay. Bye.</i>

14:44.836 --> 14:45.837
Yeah.

14:46.536 --> 14:47.537
Bye.

14:54.045 --> 14:55.143
Oh, my...

14:55.145 --> 14:57.880
Barley, keep your soldiers
off my land

14:57.882 --> 14:59.347
or our kingdoms
will go to war!

14:59.349 --> 15:01.249
Sorry, Mom!

15:01.251 --> 15:04.185
Oh, this is the world's
longest gap year.

15:04.187 --> 15:06.187
Honey, I was
gonna do that.

15:06.189 --> 15:07.622
It's okay.

15:07.624 --> 15:10.392
Wow! You must have been taught
by some kind of sewing master.

15:10.394 --> 15:13.765
Yeah. A very humble sewing master.

15:19.670 --> 15:22.637
What was Dad like
when he was my age?

15:22.639 --> 15:24.807
Was he always
super confident?

15:24.809 --> 15:25.841
Oh, no.

15:25.843 --> 15:28.913
It took him a while
to find out who he was.

15:30.114 --> 15:31.783
I wish I'd met him.

15:32.749 --> 15:34.549
Oh, me, too.

15:34.551 --> 15:38.821
But, hey, you know,
when your dad got sick,

15:38.823 --> 15:40.188
he fought so hard

15:40.190 --> 15:43.260
because he wanted to meet you
more than anything.

15:47.731 --> 15:50.534
You know what?
I have something for you.

15:51.969 --> 15:54.536
I was gonna wait
until after cake,

15:54.538 --> 15:56.939
but I think you've waited
long enough.

15:56.941 --> 15:58.074
What is it?

15:58.076 --> 16:01.344
It's a gift
from your dad.

16:06.683 --> 16:08.216
What do you mean,
it's from Dad?

16:08.218 --> 16:10.719
I don't know. Mom said
it was for both of us.

16:10.721 --> 16:11.954
What is it?

16:11.956 --> 16:16.626
He just said to give you this
when you were both over 16.

16:17.627 --> 16:20.832
I have no idea
what it is.

16:27.637 --> 16:29.304
No way!

16:29.306 --> 16:30.840
It's a wizard staff.

16:30.842 --> 16:32.174
- Dad was a wizard.
- What?

16:32.176 --> 16:34.476
Hold on, your dad
was an accountant.

16:34.478 --> 16:36.979
I mean, he got interested
in a lot of strange things

16:36.981 --> 16:38.180
when he got sick, but...

16:38.182 --> 16:39.782
There's a letter.

16:39.784 --> 16:41.316
"Dear Ian and Barley,

16:41.318 --> 16:43.618
"long ago, the world
was full of wonder.

16:43.620 --> 16:46.021
"It was adventurous,
exciting,

16:46.023 --> 16:47.823
"and best of all,
there was magic.

16:47.825 --> 16:50.126
"And that magic
helped all in need.

16:50.128 --> 16:51.659
"But it wasn't easy
to master.

16:51.661 --> 16:54.429
"And so the world found
a simpler way to get by.

16:54.431 --> 16:56.766
"Over time,
magic faded away,

16:56.768 --> 17:01.402
"but I hope there's
a little magic left in you.

17:01.404 --> 17:04.574
"And so I wrote this spell,
so I could see for myself

17:05.275 --> 17:07.611
"who my boys
grew up to be."

17:09.412 --> 17:11.048
"Visitation Spell."

17:14.284 --> 17:16.416
I don't believe this.

17:16.419 --> 17:18.319
This spell
brings him back.

17:18.320 --> 17:20.655
For one whole day,
Dad will be back.

17:20.656 --> 17:22.390
- What?
- Back? Like back to life?

17:22.392 --> 17:23.657
That's not possible.

17:23.660 --> 17:25.227
It is with this!

17:26.396 --> 17:28.296
I'm gonna meet Dad?

17:28.298 --> 17:31.366
Oh, Will, you wonderful nut.
What is this?

17:31.368 --> 17:33.969
Now, a spell this powerful
needs an assist element.

17:33.971 --> 17:35.871
And, I mean, for this to work,
Dad would've had to find

17:35.873 --> 17:37.773
a Phoenix Gem!

17:37.775 --> 17:39.008
Wow.

17:39.010 --> 17:40.708
There's only
a few of these left.

17:40.710 --> 17:42.978
Hold on!
Is this dangerous?

17:42.980 --> 17:45.016
We're about to find out.

17:48.052 --> 17:49.118
- Ah!
- What?

17:49.120 --> 17:51.686
Splinter.

17:51.688 --> 17:55.925
"Only once is all we get,
grant me this rebirth.

17:55.927 --> 18:00.630
"Till tomorrow's sun has set,
one day to walk the earth."

18:04.401 --> 18:07.702
Hold on. I was just
grippin' it wrong.

18:07.704 --> 18:10.605
"Only once is all we get,
grant me this rebirth.

18:10.607 --> 18:14.644
"Till tomorrow's sun has set,
one day to walk the earth."

18:15.478 --> 18:16.544
"Only once is all we get,

18:16.546 --> 18:18.080
"grant me this rebirth.

18:18.082 --> 18:20.448
"Till tomorrow's sun has set,
one day to walk the earth."

18:20.450 --> 18:21.884
"One day
to walk the earth."

18:21.886 --> 18:26.090
"Till tomorrow's sun has set,
one day to walk the earth."

18:26.389 --> 18:27.655
Barley.

18:34.866 --> 18:38.666
I'm sorry you guys
don't have your dad here,

18:38.668 --> 18:43.705
but this shows just how much
he wanted to see you both.

18:43.707 --> 18:46.541
So much
that he'd try anything.

18:46.543 --> 18:49.847
That's still
a pretty special gift.

18:50.680 --> 18:51.746
Yeah.

18:57.621 --> 19:01.991
Hey, wanna come with me
to pick up your cake?

19:01.993 --> 19:04.494
That's okay.
Thanks, Mom.

19:32.689 --> 19:37.494
"Only once is all we get,
grant me this rebirth.

19:42.366 --> 19:44.936
"Till tomorrow's sun
has set...

19:51.608 --> 19:54.444
"one day to
walk the earth."

19:58.849 --> 20:00.316
Hey, man,
what are you doing in here?

20:00.318 --> 20:02.384
Holy Tooth of Zadar!
How did you...?

20:02.386 --> 20:03.788
I don't know.
It just started.

20:10.828 --> 20:11.829
Whoa! Feet!

20:31.215 --> 20:33.315
Hang on. I can help!

20:33.317 --> 20:34.517
Barley, no!

20:58.242 --> 20:59.243
Dad?

21:02.645 --> 21:03.914
He's just legs.

21:06.217 --> 21:07.216
There's no top part.

21:07.218 --> 21:08.851
I definitely remember
Dad having a top part!

21:08.853 --> 21:11.288
Oh, what did I do?
This is horrible.

21:13.224 --> 21:14.557
Uh...

21:20.998 --> 21:21.999
Hello?

21:25.036 --> 21:26.435
It's really him.

21:26.437 --> 21:29.171
Dad, you are
in your house.

21:29.173 --> 21:30.174
Whoa, whoa!

21:32.410 --> 21:34.577
He can't hear us.

21:41.452 --> 21:43.018
What are you doing?

21:58.668 --> 22:02.807
That's right, Dad.
It's me, Barley.

22:12.083 --> 22:14.151
Yeah, that's Ian.

22:14.518 --> 22:16.586
Hi, Dad.

22:24.762 --> 22:27.296
I messed
this whole thing up.

22:27.298 --> 22:28.797
Now he's gonna be
legs forever.

22:28.799 --> 22:31.934
No, not forever.
The spell only lasts one day.

22:31.936 --> 22:34.002
At sunset tomorrow,
he'll disappear,

22:34.004 --> 22:36.073
and we'll never be able
to bring him back again.

22:38.275 --> 22:40.008
Okay, okay, okay.
24 hours.

22:40.010 --> 22:41.812
That doesn't give us
much time, but...

22:46.917 --> 22:48.817
Well, we'll just have
to do the spell again.

22:48.819 --> 22:50.219
You mean
you have to.

22:50.221 --> 22:52.988
A person can only do magic
if they have the gift.

22:52.990 --> 22:54.689
And my little brother
has the magic gift.

22:54.691 --> 22:56.624
Okay! Okay.

22:56.626 --> 22:58.227
But I couldn't even
finish the spell.

22:58.229 --> 23:00.562
Well, you're gonna have
plenty of time to practice.

23:00.564 --> 23:02.833
'Cause we have to find
another Phoenix Gem.

23:07.338 --> 23:11.340
A-ha! We'll start at the place
where all quests begin.

23:11.342 --> 23:13.375
The Manticore's Tavern.

23:13.377 --> 23:15.244
It's run
by a fearless adventurer.

23:15.246 --> 23:16.778
She knows where to find
any kind of gem,

23:16.780 --> 23:17.880
talisman, totem...

23:17.882 --> 23:19.680
Barley, this is for a game.

23:19.682 --> 23:21.383
Based on real life.

23:21.385 --> 23:22.650
How do we know
this tavern

23:22.652 --> 23:23.986
- is still there?
- It's there.

23:23.988 --> 23:25.854
Look, my years of training
have prepared me

23:25.856 --> 23:27.189
for this very moment.

23:27.191 --> 23:29.424
And I'm telling you,
this is the only way

23:29.426 --> 23:32.229
to find a Phoenix Gem.

23:33.564 --> 23:35.032
Trust me.

23:38.903 --> 23:42.171
Whatever it takes,
I am gonna meet my dad.

23:42.173 --> 23:45.376
You hear that, Dad?
We're going on a quest.

23:48.078 --> 23:50.913
Come on, Guinevere.

23:50.915 --> 23:53.482
Uh, maybe we should
just take the bus.

23:53.484 --> 23:55.819
She's fine.

24:16.874 --> 24:19.007
Anyway,
it's just, like,

24:19.009 --> 24:21.276
this award for math.
It's no big deal.

24:21.278 --> 24:23.881
But I'll show you
when we get back home.

24:25.583 --> 24:26.782
Hey, uh,
what are you two

24:26.784 --> 24:28.050
Chatty Charlies up to
back there?

24:28.052 --> 24:30.319
You know, I felt weird
talking to Dad

24:30.321 --> 24:32.489
without a top half, so...

24:33.090 --> 24:34.091
ta-da!

24:34.825 --> 24:36.158
Oh, that's great!

24:36.160 --> 24:38.493
Dad, you look
just like I remember.

24:38.495 --> 24:39.561
Hey, don't worry,
we'll have

24:39.563 --> 24:40.896
the rest of you here
before you know it.

24:40.898 --> 24:42.464
And then,
first thing I'm gonna do,

24:42.466 --> 24:44.533
introduce you
to Guinevere.

24:44.535 --> 24:46.702
Rebuilt this
old girl myself,

24:46.704 --> 24:48.904
from the lug nuts
to the air conditioning.

24:54.011 --> 24:55.777
Showing Dad your van?

24:55.779 --> 24:57.980
- That's your whole list?
- What list?

24:57.982 --> 24:59.181
- Oh.
- What's that?

24:59.183 --> 25:01.016
I'm just working
on a list of things

25:01.018 --> 25:02.284
I wanted to do with Dad.

25:02.286 --> 25:03.151
You know,

25:03.153 --> 25:06.121
play catch, take a walk,
driving lesson,

25:06.123 --> 25:08.423
share my whole life story
with him.

25:08.425 --> 25:09.625
That's cool.

25:09.627 --> 25:12.728
Oh. But before you cast Dad's
spell again, you're gonna

25:12.730 --> 25:15.063
have to practice your magic.

25:15.065 --> 25:17.199
This book is for a game.

25:17.201 --> 25:19.701
I told you,
everything in <i>Quests of Yore</i>

25:19.703 --> 25:21.370
is historically
accurate.

25:21.372 --> 25:22.738
Even the spells.

25:22.740 --> 25:25.874
So start practicing,
young sorcerer.

25:25.876 --> 25:30.247
Okay, Dad.
Let's try some magic.

25:34.585 --> 25:35.951
Hey, sweetie?

25:35.953 --> 25:39.421
Ugh! Blazey. Oh, this dragon
is always under my feet.

25:39.423 --> 25:41.892
Honey, you want some cake?

26:19.096 --> 26:22.864
<i>Aloft Elevar.
Aloft Elevar.</i>

26:22.866 --> 26:25.067
I can't get this
levitation spell to work.

26:25.069 --> 26:26.935
Maybe I could try
something else

26:26.937 --> 26:28.704
like Arcane Lightning?

26:28.706 --> 26:30.372
Yeah, like a level-one mage
could bust out

26:30.374 --> 26:32.074
the hardest spell in
the <i>Enchanter's Guide Book.</i>

26:32.076 --> 26:33.742
Maybe we'll
stick with the easy ones.

26:33.744 --> 26:36.545
Yeah, well, it's not working.
Am I saying it wrong?

26:36.547 --> 26:38.680
Well, mmm,
you said it right.

26:38.682 --> 26:40.082
It's just,
for any spell to work,

26:40.084 --> 26:42.084
you have to speak
from your heart's fire.

26:42.086 --> 26:43.885
- My what?
- Your heart's fire.

26:43.887 --> 26:47.124
You must speak with passion.
Don't hold back.

26:47.958 --> 26:49.124
<i>Aloft Elevar!</i>

26:49.126 --> 26:52.294
No, like <i>Aloft Elevar.</i>

26:52.296 --> 26:53.261
<i>Aloft Elevar!</i>

26:53.263 --> 26:55.664
No, from
your heart's fire!

26:55.666 --> 26:58.033
- <i>Aloft Elevar!</i>
- Don't hold back.

26:58.035 --> 26:59.769
- <i>Aloft Elevar!</i>
- Heart's fire!

26:59.771 --> 27:01.236
Stop saying
"heart's fire."

27:01.238 --> 27:04.375
This just clearly
isn't working.

27:05.876 --> 27:08.912
Hey, it was
a good start.

27:14.952 --> 27:18.653
Oh. Gather your courage, men.
We've arrived.

27:18.655 --> 27:21.523
The Manticore's Tavern.

27:21.525 --> 27:23.525
Huh. It is still here.

27:23.527 --> 27:24.928
Yeah, I told you.

27:30.968 --> 27:34.204
Come on, Dad.
That's good.

27:35.506 --> 27:38.073
All right, listen.
First, let me do the talking.

27:38.075 --> 27:39.908
Secondly,
it's crucial we show

27:39.910 --> 27:41.443
the Manticore
the respect she deserves,

27:41.445 --> 27:44.246
or she will, thirdly,
not give us a map to the Phoenix Gem.

27:44.248 --> 27:45.882
Wait, wait, wait.
The map?

27:45.884 --> 27:47.449
I thought she had
a Phoenix Gem.

27:47.451 --> 27:49.852
You're so cute.
Hear that, Dad?

27:49.854 --> 27:52.154
He's a smart kid,
he just doesn't know how quests work.

27:52.156 --> 27:55.157
Well, is there anything else
you're forgetting to tell me?

27:55.159 --> 27:56.826
Mmm. No.

27:56.828 --> 27:57.959
<i>♪ Happy happy birthday</i>

27:57.961 --> 27:59.261
<i>♪ Come join us on a quest</i>

27:59.263 --> 28:01.798
<i>♪ To make your birthday party
The very, very best</i>

28:01.800 --> 28:02.899
<i>♪ Hey!</i>

28:02.901 --> 28:04.767
Okay, okay,
so the tavern

28:04.769 --> 28:05.967
changed a little
over the years,

28:05.969 --> 28:09.504
but the Manticore
is still the real deal.

28:11.308 --> 28:12.441
I'll have the soup
of the day.

28:12.443 --> 28:14.611
Would my lord like
a cup or cauldron?

28:18.248 --> 28:21.950
Madam, I request an
audience with the Manticore.

28:21.952 --> 28:23.985
But of course, milord.

28:25.422 --> 28:27.522
Oh, Manticore!

28:31.094 --> 28:34.196
No. No, no, no.
The real Manticore.

28:34.198 --> 28:36.431
The fearless adventurer.

28:36.433 --> 28:38.569
Oh. You mean Corey?
She's over there.

28:39.871 --> 28:41.336
Quick!
Somebody help me.

28:41.338 --> 28:43.104
These griffin nuggets were
supposed to go out

28:43.106 --> 28:45.474
minutes ago.

28:45.476 --> 28:47.709
That's the Manticore?

28:47.711 --> 28:49.978
Oh, great and powerful
Manticore.

28:49.980 --> 28:52.047
Whoa! Sir, you're right
in the hot zone.

28:52.049 --> 28:53.448
You're late, Adolphus.

28:54.651 --> 28:57.419
I understand there's traffic.
You need to plan for that.

28:58.622 --> 29:01.757
Well, maybe your mother should
get her own car!

29:01.759 --> 29:03.258
Your fearlessness?

29:03.260 --> 29:05.828
My brother and I seek a map
to a Phoenix Gem.

29:05.830 --> 29:09.097
Oh! Well, you've come to
the right tavern. Table 12.

29:09.099 --> 29:13.301
I have the parchment you
desire right here. Behold!

29:13.303 --> 29:15.771
Oh. That's
a children's menu.

29:15.773 --> 29:18.740
Isn't that fun? They're all
based on my old maps.

29:18.742 --> 29:19.809
Uh, now...

29:19.811 --> 29:21.142
The great Manticore
sends you

29:21.144 --> 29:22.879
on your adventure
with a hero's blessing.

29:22.881 --> 29:24.246
And here's some crayons.

29:24.248 --> 29:26.949
That's very amusing,
your dominance,

29:26.951 --> 29:28.951
but might you have
the real map?

29:28.953 --> 29:31.088
Uh, yeah.
It's, uh, over there.

29:32.556 --> 29:34.289
That's it.

29:34.291 --> 29:36.258
- This is perfect.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!

29:36.260 --> 29:38.727
What are you doing?
You can't take this.

29:38.729 --> 29:40.163
We have to.

29:40.731 --> 29:41.998
What is that?

29:43.367 --> 29:45.133
It's our dad. And we have
a chance to meet him, but...

29:45.135 --> 29:47.536
But we can't do that
without a Phoenix Gem.

29:47.538 --> 29:51.339
No! My days of sending people
on dangerous quests are over.

29:51.341 --> 29:52.240
What? Why?

29:52.242 --> 29:53.575
'Cause they're dangerous.

29:53.577 --> 29:56.478
Corey, the karaoke
machine's broken again.

29:56.480 --> 30:00.384
I'm sorry,
but you are not getting this map.

30:00.952 --> 30:02.284
Don't worry, ladies,

30:02.286 --> 30:04.252
your adventure will continue
momentarily.

30:04.254 --> 30:05.988
Okay,
I can handle this.

30:05.990 --> 30:07.825
No, Ian.

30:09.192 --> 30:11.526
Miss mighty Manticore,
ma'am...

30:11.528 --> 30:12.762
What are you doing?

30:12.764 --> 30:14.396
Kid, this is not
a good time.

30:14.398 --> 30:17.065
Ugh. I'm giving this place
a one-star review.

30:17.067 --> 30:19.334
It's just,
I've never met my dad and...

30:19.336 --> 30:20.535
Look,
I'm sorry about that.

30:20.537 --> 30:22.404
But if you get hurt
on one of my quests,

30:22.406 --> 30:24.941
guess who gets sued
and loses her tavern?

30:24.943 --> 30:26.541
I can't take
that kind of risk.

30:26.543 --> 30:29.678
Now, if you'll just excuse me,
I have important things to do.

30:29.680 --> 30:31.212
Testing.

30:31.214 --> 30:33.248
<i>♪ You haunt my dreams</i>

30:33.250 --> 30:34.549
<i>♪ My inbetweens</i>

30:34.551 --> 30:37.019
Please,
we need that map.

30:37.021 --> 30:38.353
No, I am not
giving you the map.

30:38.355 --> 30:40.255
That's it!
I am done talking.

30:40.257 --> 30:42.959
- Well, I'm not!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!

30:42.961 --> 30:45.260
You say you can't risk
losing this place.

30:45.262 --> 30:46.428
Look at that Manticore.

30:46.430 --> 30:48.864
She looks like
she lived to take risks.

30:48.866 --> 30:51.433
That Manticore didn't have
investors to look out for.

30:51.435 --> 30:53.101
She didn't have
payroll to cover.

30:53.103 --> 30:55.071
She could just
fly out the door

30:55.073 --> 30:56.605
whenever she wanted
and slay a magma beast.

30:56.607 --> 30:58.841
Are you gonna fix
the machine or not?

30:58.843 --> 31:00.009
Yeah, in a minute.

31:00.011 --> 31:01.844
Okay, maybe
this place isn't

31:01.846 --> 31:03.645
as adventurous
as it used to be.

31:03.647 --> 31:05.513
So it isn't filled
with a motley horde

31:05.515 --> 31:07.282
willing to risk
life and limb

31:07.284 --> 31:09.384
for the mere taste
of excitement.

31:09.386 --> 31:11.319
But so what?

31:11.321 --> 31:13.121
Who ever said you have to
take risks in life

31:13.123 --> 31:14.689
to have an adventure?

31:14.691 --> 31:17.294
Apparently, you did.

31:21.732 --> 31:24.836
Table 32 said their
mozzarella sticks are cold.

31:25.937 --> 31:27.702
What have I done?

31:27.704 --> 31:28.971
Well, it's not too late.

31:28.973 --> 31:30.205
I mean, you could just
give us the map.

31:30.207 --> 31:31.439
This place
used to be dangerous.

31:31.441 --> 31:32.574
Dangerous!

31:32.576 --> 31:34.175
- And wild!
- Wild!

31:34.177 --> 31:37.079
I used to be
dangerous and wild!

31:37.081 --> 31:40.283
Dangerous and wild!

31:44.154 --> 31:46.055
Wow.

31:46.057 --> 31:49.894
I'm living a lie!
What have I become?

31:51.896 --> 31:53.062
Oh, no.

31:54.899 --> 31:56.431
Everybody out!

31:56.433 --> 32:00.168
This tavern is closed
for remodeling.

32:10.148 --> 32:13.383
Sorry, the karaoke machine
is broken!

32:18.756 --> 32:19.757
Oh.

32:22.093 --> 32:24.459
No! No, no, no!

32:24.461 --> 32:25.527
No.

32:25.529 --> 32:26.530
We gotta go!

32:36.273 --> 32:37.641
<i>Aloft Elevar!</i>

32:49.020 --> 32:51.653
That was unbelievable.

32:51.655 --> 32:53.388
I mean, you were just like...

32:53.390 --> 32:55.124
and the beam
was just floating there!

32:55.126 --> 32:57.059
My brother is a wizard.

32:57.061 --> 32:59.061
I can't believe
that worked.

32:59.063 --> 33:01.463
Oh! You're gonna nail
Dad's spell now.

33:01.465 --> 33:03.331
Except we don't
have a map.

33:03.333 --> 33:06.534
But we've got this. Behold!

33:07.571 --> 33:09.939
Look, on a quest, you have
to use what you've got.

33:09.941 --> 33:11.439
And this is
what we've got.

33:11.441 --> 33:14.944
Best part is, little Kayla
already solved the puzzle.

33:14.946 --> 33:16.779
Well, according to Kayla,

33:16.781 --> 33:19.516
we just have to look
for Raven's Point.

33:21.651 --> 33:24.053
Raven's Point.
Raven's Point.

33:24.055 --> 33:26.254
Yes! The gem must be
in the mountain.

33:26.256 --> 33:27.757
We could be there
by tomorrow morning.

33:27.759 --> 33:28.758
Tomorrow morning?

33:28.760 --> 33:31.028
That still gives us
plenty of time with Dad.

33:34.198 --> 33:36.397
Yeah. Well, it looks like

33:36.399 --> 33:38.401
the expressway should
take us right there.

33:40.204 --> 33:42.704
Mmm. Expressway is
a little too obvious.

33:42.706 --> 33:45.507
On a quest, the clear path
is never the right one.

33:45.509 --> 33:46.441
What?

33:46.443 --> 33:47.877
During one <i>Quests
of Yore</i> campaign,

33:47.879 --> 33:49.845
Shrub Rosehammer and I
took the easy route,

33:49.847 --> 33:52.882
led him straight into the
belly of a gelatinous cube.

33:52.884 --> 33:55.017
Only reason I didn't
suffer the same fate?

33:55.019 --> 33:56.351
I followed my gut.

33:56.353 --> 34:00.355
And it's telling me
we take an ancient trail

34:00.357 --> 34:02.323
called the Path of Peril.

34:02.325 --> 34:04.260
But the expressway
is faster.

34:04.262 --> 34:05.627
Maybe not in the long run.

34:05.629 --> 34:07.096
I know you
want this to be

34:07.098 --> 34:08.998
like one of
your adventure games,

34:09.000 --> 34:10.232
but all that matters

34:10.234 --> 34:12.001
is that we get to spend
as much time

34:12.003 --> 34:13.703
as possible with Dad.

34:18.042 --> 34:21.879
So, we should just take
the expressway, right?

34:23.047 --> 34:25.446
Yeah, you're right.

34:25.447 --> 34:27.750
But if you end up
inside a gelatinous cube,

34:27.752 --> 34:30.351
you are on your own.

34:43.201 --> 34:44.867
<i>Manticore's Tavern</i>

34:44.869 --> 34:46.333
<i>ahead on your right.</i>

34:48.873 --> 34:50.572
- Hey.
- <i>I'm just checking in.</i>

34:50.574 --> 34:52.041
<i>Did you catch up
to the boys yet?</i>

34:52.043 --> 34:53.108
No, not yet.

34:53.110 --> 34:54.676
But I'm a little worried
because we had

34:54.678 --> 34:56.846
a weird family issue
come up,

34:56.848 --> 35:00.082
and, well, this just isn't
like Ian to run off.

35:00.084 --> 35:01.951
I mean, Barley, yes,
but not Ian.

35:01.953 --> 35:03.018
You know, it's late,

35:03.020 --> 35:04.920
you shouldn't have to
be out looking for 'em.

35:04.922 --> 35:06.387
I know, it's silly.

35:06.389 --> 35:08.690
I'm sure they're both
probably on fire.

35:08.692 --> 35:11.359
- <i>Fire?</i>
- Fire! The place is on fire!

35:11.361 --> 35:13.528
- My boys! I gotta go!
- <i>Laurel!</i>

35:13.530 --> 35:15.331
Get it off, get it off,
get it off!

35:15.333 --> 35:16.497
Excuse me. Hello?

35:16.499 --> 35:18.767
Please, I'm looking for
two teenage elves.

35:18.769 --> 35:21.536
I told you already,
there were two teenage elves.

35:21.538 --> 35:23.873
Oh! Those are my sons.
Where did they go?

35:23.875 --> 35:26.275
Oh. They went on a quest
to find a Phoenix Gem.

35:26.277 --> 35:27.609
But don't worry,
don't worry.

35:27.611 --> 35:29.477
I told them about the map,
I told them about the gem,

35:29.479 --> 35:30.745
I told them
about the curse.

35:30.747 --> 35:32.447
I forgot to
tell them about the curse.

35:32.449 --> 35:33.749
- The what?
- Oh, boy.

35:33.751 --> 35:35.683
Listen, this one's gone
a little...

35:35.685 --> 35:38.787
Your boys are in grave danger!
But I can help!

35:38.789 --> 35:40.122
Whoa, hey, hey!

35:40.124 --> 35:43.458
You're not going anywhere.
We got questions for you.

35:43.460 --> 35:46.527
I know where they're going!
We can still save them!

35:46.529 --> 35:48.398
Okay, I think
everything's good here.

35:50.734 --> 35:53.135
Last name "Manticore",
first name "The".

35:53.137 --> 35:55.971
Hold on, you're right.
She has gone a little...

35:55.973 --> 35:59.110
It's no wonder with
a wound like that.

36:00.077 --> 36:01.377
That's just a scratch.

36:01.379 --> 36:03.711
Oh, I'm sorry, are you
an expert on minotaurs?

36:03.713 --> 36:05.114
- Manticores.
- Manticores?

36:05.116 --> 36:06.181
Well, no...

36:06.183 --> 36:07.349
Well, then
you wouldn't know

36:07.351 --> 36:09.218
that when their blood
is exposed to air,

36:09.220 --> 36:10.485
it makes them go bonkers.

36:10.487 --> 36:11.787
I don't think
that's true.

36:11.789 --> 36:13.923
See? She's already losing
her grip on reality.

36:13.925 --> 36:15.590
So, why don't you let me
save her life

36:15.592 --> 36:17.192
before it costs you yours?

36:17.194 --> 36:18.726
- Okay.
- Thank you.

36:18.728 --> 36:21.297
Could we have a little privacy
here, please?

36:21.299 --> 36:22.730
Just lie back.
That's good.

36:22.732 --> 36:24.532
But get your head
a little bit higher.

36:24.534 --> 36:27.071
Just don't take too long
back there, okay?

36:27.637 --> 36:29.038
Hey, you hear me?

36:29.040 --> 36:31.307
I said don't take
too long back there,

36:31.309 --> 36:32.742
because...

36:35.279 --> 36:37.612
All right,
how do we help my boys?

36:37.614 --> 36:40.615
Ooh! I'm gonna like you.

36:40.617 --> 36:43.052
Radio,
headlights, brakes,

36:43.054 --> 36:44.420
tires, rims.

36:44.422 --> 36:45.854
I mean, it's hard
to tell now, Dad,

36:45.856 --> 36:47.022
before I replaced
her parts,

36:47.024 --> 36:48.960
Guinevere was actually
kind of a piece of junk.

36:53.697 --> 36:56.233
Looks like we're not gonna get
to do everything today, Dad.

36:57.802 --> 36:58.869
That's okay.

36:59.536 --> 37:01.138
I just wanna meet you.

37:04.741 --> 37:07.376
But don't worry, we'll,
uh, have you fixed up

37:07.378 --> 37:09.111
and back home to see...

37:09.113 --> 37:10.545
Oh, man. Mom!

37:10.547 --> 37:11.914
Barley, we're not
gonna be able

37:11.916 --> 37:14.249
to get Dad back in time
to see Mom.

37:14.251 --> 37:15.650
Oh.

37:15.652 --> 37:18.153
Well, Dad, at least you won't
have to meet the new guy.

37:18.155 --> 37:21.556
So,
you workin' hard or hardly workin'?

37:22.994 --> 37:23.859
Yeah.

37:23.861 --> 37:25.526
Barley, Barley, Barley.

37:25.528 --> 37:27.528
Every time there's trouble,
I gotta deal with you.

37:27.530 --> 37:28.831
Is that your Colt?

37:28.833 --> 37:29.697
Yeah.

37:29.699 --> 37:31.266
You're gonna
wanna work on that.

37:31.268 --> 37:33.737
No, no, no!
Come on, old girl.

37:40.811 --> 37:42.610
I thought you
said you fixed the van.

37:42.612 --> 37:44.579
Relax. Guinevere is fine.

37:44.581 --> 37:45.881
Her stomach
is just a little empty.

37:45.883 --> 37:47.449
But it says
we have a full tank.

37:47.451 --> 37:49.820
No. That doesn't work.

37:55.692 --> 37:58.229
Oh. Only a few drops left.

37:58.963 --> 38:01.531
Maybe if
there's a gas station...

38:06.504 --> 38:07.836
Hmm.

38:14.412 --> 38:16.845
Is there a magic way
to get gas?

38:16.847 --> 38:20.617
Oh!
I like your thinking, young mage.

38:23.154 --> 38:24.119
Growth spell!

38:24.121 --> 38:26.388
We grow the can,
and then the gas inside

38:26.390 --> 38:27.555
will grow with it.

38:27.557 --> 38:30.259
Uh, that's kind of
a weird idea.

38:30.261 --> 38:32.161
I know!
I like it, too.

38:32.163 --> 38:33.429
Okay.

38:33.431 --> 38:35.864
Loosen up. Heart's fire.
Here we go.

38:35.866 --> 38:38.666
Whoa. It's not
that simple.

38:38.668 --> 38:39.935
This one learns
a little magic,

38:39.937 --> 38:41.537
thinks he's Shamblefoot
the Wondrous,

38:41.539 --> 38:43.005
am I right, Dad?

38:43.007 --> 38:45.240
A growth spell is a
bit more advanced.

38:45.242 --> 38:47.675
Not only do you have to
speak from your heart's fire,

38:47.677 --> 38:50.179
but now you also have to
follow a magic decree.

38:50.181 --> 38:51.346
A magic what?

38:51.348 --> 38:54.416
It's a special rule that keeps
the spell working right.

38:54.418 --> 38:56.518
This one states,
"To magnify an object,

38:56.520 --> 38:59.888
"you have to magnify
your attention upon it."

38:59.890 --> 39:01.824
While you cast
the spell,

39:01.826 --> 39:04.326
you can't let anything
distract you.

39:04.328 --> 39:05.461
Okay.

39:05.463 --> 39:06.528
Ow!

39:06.530 --> 39:07.628
- What?
- Splinter.

39:07.630 --> 39:08.931
Can we sand
this thing down?

39:08.933 --> 39:10.399
No. It's an ancient staff

39:10.401 --> 39:12.267
with magic
in every glorious fiber.

39:12.269 --> 39:13.601
You can't sand it down.

39:13.603 --> 39:17.773
All right. All right.
Here we go. Focus.

39:17.775 --> 39:20.309
- Uh...
- Something wrong?

39:20.311 --> 39:22.743
Sorry, it's just,
your stance is, uh... Here.

39:22.745 --> 39:24.712
Chin up, elbows out,
feet apart,

39:24.714 --> 39:26.381
back slightly arched.

39:26.383 --> 39:28.083
- Okay, how's that feel?
- Great.

39:28.085 --> 39:30.018
- Oh, one more thing...
- Barley!

39:30.020 --> 39:31.155
Okay, okay.

39:34.724 --> 39:37.394
<i>Magnora Gantuan!</i>

39:40.331 --> 39:41.830
Don't let the magic
spook you.

39:41.832 --> 39:42.833
Okay.

39:43.801 --> 39:45.167
- Elbows!
- What?

39:45.169 --> 39:46.201
Elbows up!

39:46.203 --> 39:47.668
No, no, no, it's too high.
That's too high.

39:47.670 --> 39:49.037
I'm trying to focus here.

39:49.039 --> 39:51.041
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Focus. Focus on the can.

39:51.842 --> 39:53.575
Focus.

39:55.079 --> 39:56.245
Focus.

39:56.247 --> 39:58.048
Barley! Ah!
Forget it!

40:00.551 --> 40:02.518
It worked!

40:02.520 --> 40:04.255
The can is huge.

40:04.721 --> 40:06.555
And the van is huge.

40:06.557 --> 40:07.655
And you're...

40:07.657 --> 40:08.857
Oh, no.

40:08.859 --> 40:10.526
- What happened?
- Looks like you shrunk me.

40:10.528 --> 40:11.894
How?

40:11.896 --> 40:13.795
Well, if you mess up a spell,
there are consequences.

40:13.797 --> 40:15.898
I only messed up because you
wouldn't stop bothering me.

40:15.900 --> 40:17.266
I was trying
to help you.

40:17.268 --> 40:18.467
Well, don't try
to help me.

40:18.469 --> 40:20.602
Oh, okay. Fine.
I won't!

40:20.604 --> 40:23.073
Whoa, whoa. Dad, it's me.

40:24.508 --> 40:26.208
Whoa! Dad, it's okay.
Don't worry.

40:26.210 --> 40:27.311
I'm gonna fix this.

40:28.745 --> 40:29.811
Well, where are you going?

40:29.813 --> 40:31.146
To find a gas station.

40:31.148 --> 40:32.948
- Well, I'm going, too.
- Fine.

40:32.950 --> 40:34.418
Hey, I don't
need your help.

40:34.818 --> 40:36.453
Fine with me.

40:39.223 --> 40:40.457
Oh.

40:51.635 --> 40:52.901
I just need
a little break.

40:52.903 --> 40:54.939
My baby legs
can't go that fast.

40:57.441 --> 40:59.740
Look, a gas station.

40:59.742 --> 41:00.909
Good.

41:00.911 --> 41:03.579
Oh, wait, I forgot.

41:03.581 --> 41:05.781
You don't need my help.

41:05.783 --> 41:09.386
Hey, I don't need you to carry me.
I'm a grown man.

41:11.155 --> 41:12.688
Dad!

41:12.690 --> 41:15.324
Come on, it's okay.
Barley is with me.

41:15.326 --> 41:16.491
Yeah, I'm fine, Dad.

41:16.493 --> 41:18.560
The side effects are supposed
to wear off eventually.

41:18.562 --> 41:19.727
Do I look
any bigger yet?

41:37.747 --> 41:39.514
Hey! Did you
just bump into me?

41:39.516 --> 41:41.550
Oh, I'm terribly sorry.
I didn't see you there.

41:41.552 --> 41:44.686
Do it again,
and you'll see me in your nightmares.

41:59.169 --> 42:01.169
This one's lucky.
I know it.

42:01.171 --> 42:05.040
Give me a bag of extra-sours.
Keep the change.

42:05.042 --> 42:07.177
Outta the way,
beanstalk.

42:08.579 --> 42:10.912
Uh, 10 on pump two,
please.

42:12.783 --> 42:15.617
- What are you doing?
- I'm getting us food.

42:15.619 --> 42:17.085
All right, I got it.

42:17.087 --> 42:19.288
And a couple of these.
Thank you.

42:19.290 --> 42:21.623
Psst. I have to
go to the bathroom.

42:21.625 --> 42:22.691
Can it wait?

42:22.693 --> 42:24.426
It's your pocket.

42:24.428 --> 42:27.062
Can we have the bathroom
key, please?

42:27.064 --> 42:29.064
Okay, be quick.
I want to get out of here.

42:29.066 --> 42:31.500
Okay, I'm goin'.

42:31.502 --> 42:33.370
That'll be 12.99.

42:34.038 --> 42:35.570
Hey, watch it!

42:35.572 --> 42:37.541
You got a problem, Shades?

42:39.143 --> 42:41.076
Answer me
when I'm talking to you.

42:41.078 --> 42:43.078
I'm sorry,
I don't really know

42:43.080 --> 42:44.713
where his head's
at right now.

42:44.715 --> 42:46.517
How could this night
get any worse?

42:48.519 --> 42:51.386
You know, I would
fly us to help your boys,

42:51.388 --> 42:54.022
but the old wings aren't
what they used to be.

42:54.024 --> 42:56.425
Oh, that's fine.
So, about this curse...

42:56.427 --> 42:57.626
It's my own fault.

42:57.628 --> 42:59.127
I should be doing
my wing exercises

42:59.129 --> 43:00.797
every morning,
but you know how that goes.

43:00.799 --> 43:02.998
Please, the curse.
What does it do?

43:03.000 --> 43:06.835
Right. Sorry.
It's a Guardian Curse.

43:06.837 --> 43:10.238
If your boys take the gem,
the curse will rise up

43:10.240 --> 43:12.741
and assume the form
of a mighty beast,

43:12.743 --> 43:14.710
and battle
your sons to the...

43:14.712 --> 43:17.346
Ooh. Well, how do
your boys do in a crisis?

43:17.348 --> 43:19.247
Not great. One of them
is afraid of everything,

43:19.249 --> 43:21.149
and the other
isn't afraid of anything.

43:21.151 --> 43:24.119
Yeah, that skinny kid
of yours is pretty fearless.

43:24.121 --> 43:25.987
No, no. You mean
the big one, Barley.

43:25.989 --> 43:28.957
No, no, the little guy.
Ooh, he really let me have it.

43:28.959 --> 43:31.993
What? No, look, you said
you could help them, right?

43:31.995 --> 43:33.364
Every curse has a core,

43:34.064 --> 43:36.031
the center of its power.

43:36.033 --> 43:37.699
And only one weapon
forged of

43:37.701 --> 43:39.802
the rarest metals
can destroy it,

43:39.804 --> 43:41.870
my enchanted sword,

43:41.872 --> 43:44.339
the Curse Crusher!

43:44.341 --> 43:47.442
Well, okay, but you don't
seem to have that on you.

43:47.444 --> 43:49.244
I sold it.

43:49.246 --> 43:51.213
Got in a little tax trouble
a few years back.

43:51.215 --> 43:54.516
But don't worry,
I know just where to find it.

43:54.518 --> 43:55.785
I am on my way, boys.

43:55.787 --> 43:58.021
Just try to stay
out of trouble.

44:02.059 --> 44:04.794
What is
taking you so long?

44:04.796 --> 44:06.296
Who you
calling "whimsical"?

44:06.697 --> 44:08.096
Oh, no.

44:08.098 --> 44:09.564
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!
- You've got a lot of nerve.

44:09.566 --> 44:10.499
I'm just saying,

44:10.501 --> 44:12.769
sprites used to fly around
spreading delight.

44:12.771 --> 44:13.902
That's a good thing.

44:13.904 --> 44:15.504
Sprites can't fly.

44:15.506 --> 44:18.640
Well, your wings don't work
'cause you stopped using them.

44:18.642 --> 44:21.109
- You calling me lazy?
- No, no, no.

44:21.111 --> 44:23.311
Not you.
Your ancestors.

44:23.313 --> 44:25.580
What did you say
about my ancestors?

44:25.582 --> 44:26.749
I didn't mean lazy...

44:26.751 --> 44:28.283
I'm sorry, very sorry.
He's sorry, too.

44:28.285 --> 44:30.018
You don't need to fly.
Who needs to fly?

44:30.020 --> 44:31.386
I mean, you've got
those great bikes.

44:31.388 --> 44:33.622
What are you doing?
I was just discussing history.

44:33.624 --> 44:36.057
Barley, I'm trying to
take care of you and Dad,

44:36.059 --> 44:37.760
and you're not making it
any easier.

44:37.762 --> 44:39.363
Dad, come on.

44:40.464 --> 44:41.530
Oh, no.

44:43.066 --> 44:46.003
Hey! You're dead!

44:47.839 --> 44:49.304
We're dead! We're dead!
We're dead!

44:49.306 --> 44:51.774
Relax. They won't be
able to lift those bikes.

44:51.776 --> 44:53.375
They are strong.

44:53.377 --> 44:55.477
We're gonna die! We're gonna die!
We're gonna die!

44:55.479 --> 44:56.545
It's locked.

44:56.547 --> 44:57.548
What?
Where are the keys?

45:00.717 --> 45:02.152
I got this.

45:02.887 --> 45:04.419
Come on, Barley.

45:04.421 --> 45:06.023
Whoa!

45:07.424 --> 45:08.623
Okay, go, go, go!

45:10.160 --> 45:12.227
No. No, no, no. No way.

45:12.229 --> 45:13.430
You're gonna have to.

45:18.803 --> 45:20.101
Come on.
Why won't it start?

45:20.103 --> 45:21.236
There's a sweet spot.

45:21.238 --> 45:22.637
Not in the middle,
not quite at the end.

45:22.639 --> 45:24.074
Come on.
Come on. Come on.

45:25.175 --> 45:27.676
Come on, Guinevere!

45:27.678 --> 45:30.380
Put it in "o" for "onward."

45:36.019 --> 45:37.354
Drive!

45:40.892 --> 45:43.091
Okay, you're gonna
have to merge.

45:44.963 --> 45:46.127
- Speed up!
- I can't do this.

45:46.129 --> 45:47.763
- Yes, you can.
- I'm not ready!

45:47.765 --> 45:49.664
You'll never be ready. Merge!

45:52.703 --> 45:54.772
Nice job!

46:00.143 --> 46:02.379
- Hey, don't hit Gwinny.
- Barley!

46:05.349 --> 46:07.148
- Oh, no.
- Get around 'em!

46:07.150 --> 46:08.751
- They're not letting me in.
- Signal.

46:08.753 --> 46:10.051
You don't have a signaler.

46:10.053 --> 46:12.589
Stick your arm straight out
the window to signal left.

46:19.563 --> 46:22.432
- Get back here.
- Just keep driving.

46:28.672 --> 46:30.107
Barley!

46:33.912 --> 46:36.077
The mountains are north.

46:36.079 --> 46:37.681
You need to get
all the way over.

46:41.552 --> 46:42.617
What the...?

46:43.821 --> 46:46.323
Oh, it is on, Shades!
Get 'em!

46:59.904 --> 47:02.337
- Ian, stay focused!
- I can't!

47:02.339 --> 47:05.642
You have to focus
or we are all dead!

47:07.244 --> 47:09.379
Just stay cool.

47:17.989 --> 47:20.056
Way to go, Guinevere!

47:24.494 --> 47:25.495
Hit it!

47:29.232 --> 47:31.000
We're not gonna make it!

47:48.619 --> 47:50.019
Dad, are you okay?

47:50.021 --> 47:52.220
He's fine, thanks to
the skillful driving

47:52.222 --> 47:54.824
of Sir Ian Lightfoot.
High five!

47:54.826 --> 47:56.058
What is happening?

47:56.060 --> 47:58.228
I think the spell
is wearing off.

47:59.129 --> 48:00.330
Get off my face.

48:07.404 --> 48:10.171
Chantor's Talon! Cops!

48:10.173 --> 48:11.673
- Pull over.
- I don't have a license.

48:11.675 --> 48:13.577
My wallet's still tiny.

48:18.148 --> 48:20.215
<i>Step out
of the vehicle.</i>

48:20.217 --> 48:21.549
- What are we gonna do?
- I don't know.

48:21.551 --> 48:23.553
How are we gonna explain...?
Oh, no. Dad!

48:33.330 --> 48:35.330
You have a long night
there, buddy?

48:35.332 --> 48:36.431
Sir, I'm gonna ask you

48:36.433 --> 48:37.499
to walk this straight line.

48:37.501 --> 48:38.801
They're gonna take Dad.

48:38.803 --> 48:39.668
Okay, okay.

48:39.670 --> 48:42.237
Oh, I got it.
The disguise spell.

48:42.239 --> 48:45.074
You can disguise yourself
to be anyone you want.

48:45.076 --> 48:46.207
But what if I
mess up again?

48:46.209 --> 48:47.375
According to the spell,

48:47.377 --> 48:49.277
"Disguising yourself
is a lie,

48:49.279 --> 48:51.147
"so you must tell the truth
to get by."

48:51.149 --> 48:54.249
As long as you don't tell a
lie, the spell will be fine.

48:54.251 --> 48:57.619
Okay. Who are
we gonna be?

48:57.621 --> 48:59.789
Okay, we're taking you
down to the station.

48:59.791 --> 49:02.792
What seems to be the problem

49:02.794 --> 49:06.261
here, fellow police folk?

49:06.263 --> 49:07.362
Officer Bronco?

49:07.364 --> 49:09.165
Were you in that van?

49:09.167 --> 49:10.665
Affirmative.
And we will...

49:10.667 --> 49:13.002
I mean, I will take
full responsibility

49:13.004 --> 49:14.302
for that fella right there,

49:14.304 --> 49:16.504
so you can just release him
over to me.

49:16.506 --> 49:18.239
Hey,
I wanted to be the front.

49:18.241 --> 49:19.607
No way.
I'll do the talking.

49:19.609 --> 49:21.043
Bronco, I thought
you were working

49:21.045 --> 49:22.277
on the other
side of town.

49:22.279 --> 49:23.948
I, uh, changed my mind.

49:25.083 --> 49:26.816
Something wrong?

49:26.818 --> 49:28.719
Just a little neck cramp.

49:30.220 --> 49:32.353
You have to stop lying.

49:32.355 --> 49:34.255
Answer every question
with a question.

49:34.257 --> 49:36.224
What exactly
are you doing out here?

49:36.226 --> 49:38.493
Uh... What am I doing
out here?

49:38.495 --> 49:41.362
What are any of us
doing out here?

49:41.364 --> 49:44.532
Whoa. I never thought
about it like that.

49:44.534 --> 49:45.734
Nice.

49:45.736 --> 49:47.970
With all due respect,
you didn't answer my question.

49:47.972 --> 49:50.338
Well, we were
just exercising

49:50.340 --> 49:54.377
some driver's education
drills for Ian.

49:55.345 --> 49:57.113
Who is Ian?

49:57.115 --> 49:59.347
Oh, is that
Laurel's kid?

49:59.349 --> 50:02.184
Ian is Laurel's kid.

50:02.186 --> 50:05.020
Your stepson was swerving
all over the road.

50:05.022 --> 50:06.254
Yeah, well...

50:06.256 --> 50:08.356
that guy's
not all there today.

50:08.358 --> 50:11.361
Yeah, he does seem
a little off.

50:12.562 --> 50:15.330
You seem
a little off yourself.

50:15.332 --> 50:19.135
Uh, actually, if I'm being
completely honest,

50:19.137 --> 50:20.435
I'm not super great

50:20.437 --> 50:21.871
in this kind
of situation,

50:21.873 --> 50:23.906
and I'm starting
to freak out a little bit.

50:23.908 --> 50:27.475
And I'm all sweaty and weird,
and I don't know what to say

50:27.477 --> 50:29.912
and I just feel like
I can't do anything right,

50:29.914 --> 50:31.412
and I'm a total weirdo.

50:31.414 --> 50:34.083
Hold on, hold on.

50:34.085 --> 50:36.684
I think I know
what's going on here.

50:36.686 --> 50:38.286
Uh... You do?

50:38.288 --> 50:40.488
It's not easy
being a new parent.

50:40.490 --> 50:43.058
My girlfriend's daughter got
me pulling my hair out, okay?

50:43.060 --> 50:44.994
Oh. Oh, yeah.

50:44.996 --> 50:46.762
All right,
we can let him go.

50:46.764 --> 50:50.833
Okay, well, I'm just gonna
take him to the van.

50:50.835 --> 50:53.869
Hey, it gets better. All right?
Good luck, Bronco.

50:53.871 --> 50:55.403
You, too, Officer.

50:55.405 --> 50:58.174
Keep workin' hard
or hardly workin'.

50:59.409 --> 51:02.077
Now, that was
a good Colt.

51:02.079 --> 51:03.645
I don't envy you,
Bronco.

51:03.647 --> 51:05.848
That Lightfoot kid
is a handful.

51:05.850 --> 51:08.683
Uh, I'm gonna have to
disagree with you there.

51:08.685 --> 51:11.887
I think Ian's
a pretty stand-up citizen.

51:11.889 --> 51:14.656
Not him,
the older one.

51:14.658 --> 51:15.523
What?

51:15.525 --> 51:18.326
I mean,
the guy's a screwup.

51:18.328 --> 51:20.129
You can't say
you don't agree.

51:20.131 --> 51:21.731
Um, I don't.

51:24.135 --> 51:25.335
What?

51:26.336 --> 51:28.336
I mean, okay, well...

51:28.338 --> 51:30.873
I gotta get going.
Gotta get Ian home.

51:30.875 --> 51:33.575
I mean, I'm late for work.

51:33.577 --> 51:35.376
Sorry, I mean,
I'm feelin' a little sick.

51:35.378 --> 51:37.412
I mean tired.
Sick and tired. Gotta go!

51:37.414 --> 51:38.783
See you Monday!

51:42.719 --> 51:45.855
Oh, man.
Bronco is losin' it.

51:45.857 --> 51:47.790
See, that's why
I never got married.

51:47.792 --> 51:49.994
Old Gore can't
be tied down.

51:55.498 --> 51:57.099
This is Specter.

51:57.101 --> 52:00.771
Can you put me through
to Officer Colt Bronco?

52:10.747 --> 52:14.250
Barley, I don't know
what happened back there.

52:14.252 --> 52:16.553
But I don't think
you're a screwup.

52:19.023 --> 52:21.926
Maybe the magic just got it
wrong, you know.

52:22.994 --> 52:24.159
Yeah.

52:26.396 --> 52:28.730
I don't know
what happened.

52:28.732 --> 52:30.966
Barley! Barley!

52:37.607 --> 52:39.409
Where are you going?

52:40.912 --> 52:42.945
Barley, come on.
This is all just...

52:42.947 --> 52:44.179
I'm not a screwup.

52:44.181 --> 52:45.446
I didn't say
you were.

52:45.448 --> 52:47.182
The magic said it for you.

52:47.184 --> 52:48.784
Well, the magic
got it wrong.

52:48.786 --> 52:50.451
Magic doesn't
get it wrong!

52:50.453 --> 52:51.754
The cop asked a question,

52:51.756 --> 52:54.722
you answered, and magic
revealed the truth. Right?

52:54.724 --> 52:55.590
Right?

52:55.592 --> 52:57.625
I don't know how
any of this stuff works.

52:57.627 --> 52:59.427
All I know is
that everything

52:59.429 --> 53:01.096
we've done tonight
has gone wrong.

53:01.098 --> 53:02.998
Yeah, it's gone wrong because
you won't listen to me.

53:03.000 --> 53:04.133
Are you kidding?

53:04.135 --> 53:05.768
Because everything we've
done has been your idea.

53:05.770 --> 53:07.036
But you didn't do it my way.

53:07.038 --> 53:08.736
You didn't let me
handle the Manticore.

53:08.738 --> 53:10.505
You freaked out when I
talked to the sprites.

53:10.507 --> 53:12.007
'Cause you don't think
I have good ideas.

53:12.009 --> 53:13.208
What? Of course I do.

53:13.210 --> 53:15.878
Great! Then I think we should
take the Path of Peril.

53:15.880 --> 53:19.048
And I also think that
would be good, normally...

53:19.050 --> 53:19.915
See?

53:19.917 --> 53:21.616
But, I told you,
this isn't a game.

53:21.618 --> 53:23.419
All that matters today
is Dad,

53:23.421 --> 53:25.620
and right now
he's sitting in that van,

53:25.622 --> 53:27.089
and he's confused...

53:27.091 --> 53:28.092
What?

53:31.896 --> 53:33.128
What is he doing?

53:33.130 --> 53:35.663
I think he can feel the
vibrations of the music,

53:35.665 --> 53:38.202
and he's dancing.

53:41.939 --> 53:42.974
Wow.

53:43.540 --> 53:45.910
He is terrible.

53:51.349 --> 53:53.951
Yeah. He's really,
really bad.

53:54.752 --> 53:56.452
Oh, no.
Here he comes.

53:56.454 --> 53:58.519
No, no, no. Thanks, Dad.
Dad, thank you.

53:58.521 --> 53:59.654
I'm good.

53:59.656 --> 54:00.923
Stop.

54:00.925 --> 54:03.225
Okay. Okay.

54:03.227 --> 54:04.659
No, no, no!

54:04.661 --> 54:06.494
I'm not really
a big dancer.

54:06.496 --> 54:07.898
Uh...

54:10.301 --> 54:13.302
Just imagine what the top half
of this dance looks like.

54:13.304 --> 54:15.572
I bet it goes
something like this.

54:24.614 --> 54:25.914
Ow.

54:25.916 --> 54:28.252
Ah, you danced your
shoelaces loose there, Pop.

54:32.023 --> 54:35.026
You know,
I wanna see him, too.

54:36.360 --> 54:38.761
Yeah, I know.

54:38.763 --> 54:40.661
It's not fair for you
to call me a screwup

54:40.663 --> 54:43.700
if you don't give me a chance
to get something right.

54:44.301 --> 54:46.237
Just do one thing
my way.

54:47.471 --> 54:50.072
You really think
this Path of Peril

54:50.074 --> 54:52.143
is the best way
to go to the mountain?

54:56.113 --> 54:57.281
Okay.

55:11.728 --> 55:14.863
Uh... So, where is
your magic sword?

55:14.865 --> 55:17.134
It lies beyond
those gates.

55:18.769 --> 55:21.236
If we don't leave here
with the sword,

55:21.238 --> 55:23.238
your boys are doomed.

55:23.240 --> 55:24.506
There you are.

55:24.508 --> 55:26.275
One garlic crusher.

55:26.277 --> 55:27.742
No, Curse Crusher.

55:27.744 --> 55:29.945
It's a large magical sword.

55:29.947 --> 55:31.113
Sword.

55:31.115 --> 55:33.482
Sword, sword, sword.

55:33.484 --> 55:35.152
I mean, I got this thing.

55:36.353 --> 55:37.886
- That's it!
- How much?

55:38.856 --> 55:41.557
- Let's call it, uh, 10.
- Great!

55:41.559 --> 55:43.258
Forged of
the rarest metals,

55:43.260 --> 55:46.261
the only sword of its kind
in all the land.

55:47.264 --> 55:50.399
Hello, old friend.
We shall never part again.

55:50.401 --> 55:52.401
Oh! Turns out this sword

55:52.403 --> 55:55.703
is the only sword of its
kind in all the land.

55:55.705 --> 55:59.640
So, let's call it 10,000.

55:59.642 --> 56:03.145
- You can't do that!
- Well, I just did.

56:03.147 --> 56:04.679
Okay, you had better...

56:04.681 --> 56:06.647
Yeah?

56:06.649 --> 56:08.317
Hey, I talked
to some other officers,

56:08.319 --> 56:10.552
and they said the boys
were last seen going north.

56:10.554 --> 56:12.121
- Are they okay?
- <i>They're fine.</i>

56:12.123 --> 56:14.423
But the officers said...
Well, honey,

56:14.425 --> 56:17.126
<i>this night keeps getting
stranger and stranger.</i>

56:17.128 --> 56:18.794
Do you know who I am?

56:18.796 --> 56:20.963
Some kind of
winged bear-snake lady?

56:20.965 --> 56:23.265
Argh! Winged
lion-scorpion lady!

56:23.267 --> 56:24.632
It sure does.

56:24.634 --> 56:26.135
Listen, I need
that sword.

56:26.137 --> 56:28.170
My sons have a
once-in-a-lifetime chance

56:28.172 --> 56:29.238
to see their father.

56:29.240 --> 56:30.241
Now, my oldest son...

56:31.876 --> 56:34.109
Holy son of a...
You killed her!

56:34.111 --> 56:36.812
It's okay. She's only
temporarily paralyzed.

56:36.814 --> 56:38.480
Hey, you can't do this.

56:38.482 --> 56:40.382
- Well, I just did.
- Grab the sword.

56:40.384 --> 56:41.583
Don't you touch that.

56:41.585 --> 56:42.751
Here you go.

56:42.753 --> 56:44.253
And a little something extra
for your trouble.

56:44.255 --> 56:45.420
I love your store.

56:45.422 --> 56:46.957
Oh, that's so pretty.

56:47.391 --> 56:49.091
Hey! Hey!

56:49.093 --> 56:50.893
Yeah!

56:50.895 --> 56:52.294
Laurel, what's happening?

56:52.296 --> 56:54.129
- Yeah!
- <i>Hello? Are you all right?</i>

56:54.131 --> 56:55.097
<i>Laurel?</i>

56:55.099 --> 56:57.566
Oh, Colt, I can't talk.
The boys need me.

56:57.568 --> 56:59.434
Wait!

56:59.436 --> 57:01.105
Dang those kids.

57:05.509 --> 57:06.709
Huh.

57:33.204 --> 57:35.070
<i>♪ We're heading on a quest</i>

57:35.072 --> 57:36.805
<i>♪ Our father we must retrieve</i>

57:36.807 --> 57:38.974
<i>♪ The Lightfoot brothers
can't be stopped</i>

57:38.976 --> 57:40.542
<i>♪ Something, something</i>

57:40.544 --> 57:42.411
<i>♪ That rhymes with retrieve</i>

57:46.850 --> 57:49.117
Yeah, we're still here.

57:49.119 --> 57:52.521
Well, good morning to thee,
dear Lightfoot men.

57:52.523 --> 57:55.490
Welcome to
the Path of Peril.

57:55.492 --> 57:57.626
It's not
much of a path.

57:57.628 --> 58:00.295
Well, you know, they never
really developed around here.

58:00.297 --> 58:02.231
So, heads up, we could
run into anything.

58:02.233 --> 58:05.500
A centicore, wolf dragon,
gelatinous cube.

58:05.502 --> 58:07.970
Okay, what is
a gelatinous cube?

58:07.972 --> 58:09.871
Oh, it's
a giant green cube

58:09.873 --> 58:12.774
that instantly disintegrates
all that it touches.

58:12.776 --> 58:14.676
We are not gonna
run into a... Oh! Stop!

58:14.678 --> 58:16.247
Ahh!

58:25.456 --> 58:26.755
What is this?

58:26.757 --> 58:28.156
Bottomless pit.

58:28.158 --> 58:32.160
Whatever falls in there,
falls forever.

58:34.932 --> 58:37.266
Aw, Dad, come here.

58:37.268 --> 58:38.233
Ian, check it out.

58:38.235 --> 58:41.737
This is
an ancient drawbridge.

58:41.739 --> 58:43.005
We lower that bad boy

58:43.007 --> 58:45.776
and we are on our way
to Raven's Point.

58:46.677 --> 58:48.879
Look around for a lever.

58:50.547 --> 58:51.747
Found it.

58:51.749 --> 58:54.318
But it's on
the other side.

58:55.252 --> 58:57.421
Okay, I got this.

58:57.855 --> 58:59.456
<i>Aloft Elevar.</i>

59:03.894 --> 59:05.527
You can't cast
a levitation spell

59:05.529 --> 59:06.928
on something
that far away.

59:06.930 --> 59:09.131
It only has, like, a 15-meter
enchanting radius.

59:09.133 --> 59:11.135
Dad, can you
believe this guy?

59:12.202 --> 59:14.836
What we need
is a Trust Bridge.

59:14.838 --> 59:17.205
It's a spell that creates
a magical bridge

59:17.207 --> 59:18.540
you can walk on.

59:18.542 --> 59:21.743
Just say
<i>"Bridgrigar Invisia."</i>

59:21.745 --> 59:23.945
Okay.
<i>Bridgrigar Invisia.</i>

59:23.947 --> 59:26.283
<i>Bridgrigar Invisia!</i>

59:29.186 --> 59:31.420
- It didn't work.
- No, the spell's still going.

59:31.422 --> 59:33.922
You won't know if your bridge
worked until you step on it.

59:33.924 --> 59:35.190
Step on what?

59:35.192 --> 59:37.159
If you believe the bridge
is there, then it's there.

59:37.161 --> 59:39.227
- But it's not.
- Well, not with that attitude.

59:39.229 --> 59:41.498
I'm not gonna step out
onto nothing.

59:44.568 --> 59:46.101
Now we've got a rope.

59:46.103 --> 59:47.703
But you're not gonna
even need it because...

59:47.705 --> 59:48.937
- I want the rope!
- Okay.

59:48.939 --> 59:50.739
I'm just saying you're not
gonna need the rope,

59:50.741 --> 59:52.976
because I know
you can make that bridge.

01:00:03.420 --> 01:00:05.788
I'm dying! I'm dying! I'm dead!
I'm dead! I'm dead!

01:00:05.790 --> 01:00:07.589
- Oh, my life is over.
- I got you.

01:00:10.894 --> 01:00:12.127
Okay, you fell.

01:00:12.129 --> 01:00:13.895
- But was that so bad?
- Yes!

01:00:13.897 --> 01:00:16.932
- Are you still alive?
- Yes.

01:00:16.934 --> 01:00:19.836
Okay, so now you know
the worst that can happen.

01:00:19.838 --> 01:00:22.306
So, there's nothing
to be scared of, right?

01:00:26.076 --> 01:00:28.946
<i>Bridgrigar Invisia!</i>

01:00:31.915 --> 01:00:35.652
Hey. You can do this.

01:00:44.228 --> 01:00:46.595
- Yeah!
- There you go!

01:00:49.066 --> 01:00:50.767
Believe with
every step.

01:00:53.303 --> 01:00:55.305
Oh, yeah!

01:00:58.843 --> 01:00:59.975
You've got me, right?

01:00:59.977 --> 01:01:01.178
I still got you.

01:01:02.980 --> 01:01:05.983
Ian Lightfoot
is fearless.

01:01:09.788 --> 01:01:12.256
This is amazing!

01:01:14.826 --> 01:01:16.391
Yeah! But just keep going.

01:01:16.393 --> 01:01:19.463
Don't look back.
Just straight ahead.

01:01:21.131 --> 01:01:23.365
You've still got
the rope, right?

01:01:23.367 --> 01:01:25.000
Yeah, I got it.

01:01:25.002 --> 01:01:27.736
I am not afraid!

01:01:27.738 --> 01:01:30.672
Oh, man, I could stay
out here all day.

01:01:30.674 --> 01:01:32.007
Huh. Huh.

01:01:32.009 --> 01:01:34.777
Okay, but keep moving.
We've gotta see Dad, remember?

01:01:34.779 --> 01:01:38.449
Hey, Dad,
this last step is for you.

01:01:39.784 --> 01:01:41.952
Ahh!

01:01:46.990 --> 01:01:48.791
Oh.

01:01:55.934 --> 01:01:57.800
He did it, Dad.

01:02:05.609 --> 01:02:07.910
That was amazing.

01:02:07.912 --> 01:02:10.412
How long was
the rope gone?

01:02:10.414 --> 01:02:13.383
Oh, just, like,
the second half of it.

01:02:13.885 --> 01:02:16.017
I needed that rope.

01:02:16.019 --> 01:02:18.388
Oh, but did you?

01:02:23.994 --> 01:02:26.430
Ian! Look.

01:02:27.866 --> 01:02:29.433
It's a raven.

01:02:30.400 --> 01:02:33.437
The clue on the menu said
Raven's Point.

01:02:34.171 --> 01:02:37.038
Yeah.
In the mountains.

01:02:37.040 --> 01:02:39.441
But maybe the puzzle
didn't mean the mountain.

01:02:39.443 --> 01:02:42.379
Maybe it means follow
where the raven is pointing.

01:02:46.116 --> 01:02:48.617
It's another raven.

01:02:48.619 --> 01:02:50.987
That one could be
pointing to another raven,

01:02:50.989 --> 01:02:52.922
all the way to the gem.

01:02:52.924 --> 01:02:55.290
I... I had us going
the wrong way.

01:02:55.292 --> 01:02:57.526
Well, I told you.
My gut knows where to go.

01:02:57.528 --> 01:02:59.628
Don't you, boy?
Yes, you do.

01:03:00.932 --> 01:03:02.364
- Huh.
- Come on, Dad.

01:03:02.366 --> 01:03:04.699
Guinevere will get us
to that raven in no time.

01:03:10.574 --> 01:03:13.809
You guys...

01:03:13.811 --> 01:03:15.410
...are in trouble,
big time.

01:03:15.412 --> 01:03:16.913
No, no, no, Colt.
We found a spell.

01:03:16.915 --> 01:03:19.982
If we finish it before sunset,
we'll get to see our father.

01:03:19.984 --> 01:03:21.716
Ahh!

01:03:21.718 --> 01:03:23.318
Well, uh,
your mom told me

01:03:23.320 --> 01:03:25.922
there was some kind of
strange

01:03:25.924 --> 01:03:27.355
family issue going on,

01:03:27.357 --> 01:03:30.458
and this is
definitely strange.

01:03:30.460 --> 01:03:31.493
But no, dang it.

01:03:31.495 --> 01:03:33.395
I'm not letting you
upset your mother anymore.

01:03:33.397 --> 01:03:35.798
Now you get in the vehicle,
I'm escorting you home.

01:03:35.800 --> 01:03:36.999
No. No way.

01:03:37.001 --> 01:03:38.803
I'm giving you
to the count of three.

01:03:40.972 --> 01:03:43.204
- Okay, we'll go.
- Ian.

01:03:43.206 --> 01:03:45.475
He's a police officer.

01:03:52.549 --> 01:03:53.682
What are you doing?

01:03:53.684 --> 01:03:55.218
I don't know.

01:03:56.219 --> 01:03:57.789
Son of a...

01:04:00.257 --> 01:04:02.591
I need backup.
Runaway van!

01:04:03.594 --> 01:04:06.628
Yeah! Iandore Lightfoot,
breaking the rules.

01:04:06.630 --> 01:04:08.396
I can't believe
I'm running from the cops.

01:04:08.398 --> 01:04:09.664
You're not running
from the cops,

01:04:09.666 --> 01:04:12.100
you're running from
our mom's boyfriend.

01:04:13.270 --> 01:04:15.405
Okay, now you're running
from the cops.

01:04:26.985 --> 01:04:28.450
Hold on!

01:04:28.452 --> 01:04:30.554
Whoa!

01:04:33.992 --> 01:04:36.524
Yeah! Nice going,
Guinevere!

01:04:52.342 --> 01:04:54.676
Oh, what did I do?
I shouldn't have driven away.

01:04:54.678 --> 01:04:56.277
No, it was great.

01:04:56.279 --> 01:04:57.880
Hey, block the road
with those boulders.

01:04:57.882 --> 01:04:59.614
What? How?

01:04:59.616 --> 01:05:00.548
Arcane Lightning.

01:05:00.550 --> 01:05:02.250
You said that's
the hardest spell.

01:05:02.252 --> 01:05:03.418
You are ready.

01:05:03.420 --> 01:05:05.153
"To make lightning
strike with ease,

01:05:05.155 --> 01:05:06.789
"one must follow
all decrees."

01:05:06.791 --> 01:05:07.957
You have to
do everything.

01:05:07.959 --> 01:05:09.058
Speak from
your heart's fire,

01:05:09.060 --> 01:05:11.528
trust yourself, focus,
all of it.

01:05:13.397 --> 01:05:16.199
<i>Voltar Thundasir.</i>

01:05:17.035 --> 01:05:18.801
<i>Voltar Thundasir.</i>

01:05:18.803 --> 01:05:20.669
<i>Voltar Thundasir!</i>

01:05:27.344 --> 01:05:30.046
I can't! I can't do it.

01:05:31.481 --> 01:05:35.820
We're not gonna see you, Dad.
And it's all my fault.

01:05:55.338 --> 01:05:56.640
What are you doing?

01:06:42.186 --> 01:06:43.755
What the...?

01:06:52.964 --> 01:06:54.496
Barley.

01:06:54.498 --> 01:06:57.300
She was just
a beat-up old van.

01:06:58.368 --> 01:07:00.470
Come on, we gotta go.

01:08:04.235 --> 01:08:05.435
Wait.

01:08:20.251 --> 01:08:21.884
Oh. You see that, Dad?

01:08:21.886 --> 01:08:24.988
The apprentice has become
the master.

01:08:27.091 --> 01:08:28.692
It looks like water.

01:08:33.496 --> 01:08:35.630
So, what's the,
uh, X mean?

01:08:35.631 --> 01:08:38.901
On a quest,
an X only means one thing.

01:08:38.903 --> 01:08:42.538
We go to the end of the water,
we'll find that Phoenix Gem.

01:08:54.886 --> 01:08:55.953
Unicorns!

01:09:14.738 --> 01:09:16.040
Whoa.

01:09:18.309 --> 01:09:19.944
Cool.

01:09:22.979 --> 01:09:26.115
This water
could go on for miles.

01:09:26.117 --> 01:09:28.350
We don't have
that kinda time.

01:09:28.352 --> 01:09:30.352
If we had something
to float on,

01:09:30.354 --> 01:09:32.354
we could cast
a velocity spell on it,

01:09:32.356 --> 01:09:34.356
fly down the tunnel
like a magic jet ski.

01:09:34.358 --> 01:09:36.691
Well, there's not
much to float on.

01:09:36.693 --> 01:09:38.459
Remember, on a quest,

01:09:38.461 --> 01:09:41.098
you have to use
what you've got.

01:09:43.033 --> 01:09:45.202
<i>Magnora Gantuan!</i>

01:09:47.203 --> 01:09:48.805
Woo-hoo!

01:09:49.907 --> 01:09:51.508
<i>Accelior!</i>

01:09:52.509 --> 01:09:53.841
Whoa!

01:09:53.844 --> 01:09:56.378
This is
actually kinda cool.

01:09:56.380 --> 01:09:59.081
So, what other spells
do you know?

01:09:59.083 --> 01:10:01.549
Brace
yourself, young mage.

01:10:01.551 --> 01:10:04.587
I know all there is
to know of magic.

01:10:07.557 --> 01:10:08.991
Colt, we know
where the boys are going.

01:10:08.993 --> 01:10:11.293
We just have to get to them
before they unleash the curse.

01:10:11.295 --> 01:10:13.929
- <i>The what?</i>
- Let's crush some curses!

01:10:13.931 --> 01:10:15.563
The curse. The curse
that protects the gem

01:10:15.565 --> 01:10:17.166
by turning into a rock
dragon or something.

01:10:17.168 --> 01:10:18.233
<i>A what dragon?</i>

01:10:18.235 --> 01:10:19.368
I can't explain it.

01:10:19.370 --> 01:10:21.103
I just know we have
to get to the boys fast.

01:10:21.105 --> 01:10:23.707
Oh, we'll get to them fast.
We'll get to them so fast.

01:10:24.241 --> 01:10:25.573
Oh!

01:10:25.575 --> 01:10:28.509
Well, I almost had 'em,
but Ian, he just drove off.

01:10:28.511 --> 01:10:30.312
- Huh. Good for him.
- <i>What?</i>

01:10:30.314 --> 01:10:32.047
No, I just mean
he's scared to drive.

01:10:32.049 --> 01:10:34.183
Thinks something's gonna
come at him out of the...

01:10:44.694 --> 01:10:46.462
Oh! I think
I stung my leg.

01:10:46.464 --> 01:10:48.529
<i>Laurel, what happened?
What's goin' on?</i>

01:10:48.531 --> 01:10:49.965
You almost
killed me, lady.

01:10:49.967 --> 01:10:52.134
Are you okay?
Where did you come from?

01:10:52.136 --> 01:10:53.435
You were
in our flight path.

01:10:54.637 --> 01:10:56.537
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine.

01:10:56.539 --> 01:10:58.073
Oh, no. Our transport!

01:10:58.075 --> 01:11:00.175
How are we going
to get to your sons now?

01:11:00.177 --> 01:11:03.412
Come on, Pixie Dusters,
let's take to the skies.

01:11:03.414 --> 01:11:05.648
- Yeah!
- I was born to fly!

01:11:06.683 --> 01:11:09.652
How do you feel about
exercising those wings?

01:11:10.553 --> 01:11:11.756
Uh...

01:11:14.091 --> 01:11:15.457
<i>Boombastia!</i>

01:11:15.459 --> 01:11:17.895
- Ah, remember...
- Oh, right.

01:11:18.329 --> 01:11:19.797
<i>Boombastia!</i>

01:11:20.798 --> 01:11:21.964
Whoa!

01:11:21.966 --> 01:11:24.900
Yeah! You're a natural!
Think fast.

01:11:24.902 --> 01:11:26.168
<i>Aloft Elevar!</i>

01:11:26.170 --> 01:11:28.272
Yeah! Nice!

01:11:29.306 --> 01:11:31.040
Careful how much boat
you're eating there, man,

01:11:31.042 --> 01:11:33.142
we still gotta make it
to the end of the tunnel.

01:11:33.144 --> 01:11:34.711
Yeah. Good point.

01:11:37.948 --> 01:11:40.516
I can't believe
I'm this close

01:11:40.518 --> 01:11:42.418
to actually
talking to Dad.

01:11:42.420 --> 01:11:43.519
You know what
I'm gonna ask him?

01:11:43.521 --> 01:11:45.087
If he ever gave himself
a wizard name.

01:11:45.089 --> 01:11:45.954
What?

01:11:45.956 --> 01:11:47.022
Well, 'cause he was
into magic.

01:11:47.024 --> 01:11:48.556
Lots of wizards
have cool names.

01:11:48.558 --> 01:11:50.325
Alora the Majestic.

01:11:50.327 --> 01:11:52.693
Birdar the Fanciful.

01:11:52.695 --> 01:11:54.163
Anyway,
it'll just be nice

01:11:54.165 --> 01:11:56.365
to have more than
four memories of him.

01:11:56.367 --> 01:11:57.732
- Uh, three.
- Hmm?

01:11:57.734 --> 01:11:59.334
You only have
three memories.

01:11:59.336 --> 01:12:00.601
Oh, yeah.

01:12:00.603 --> 01:12:01.904
Barley, do you have

01:12:01.906 --> 01:12:03.872
another memory of Dad
you haven't told me?

01:12:03.874 --> 01:12:07.376
No, it's just
not my favorite.

01:12:07.378 --> 01:12:08.977
What do you mean?

01:12:11.048 --> 01:12:13.916
When Dad was sick,

01:12:13.918 --> 01:12:18.956
I was supposed to go in
and say goodbye to him.

01:12:19.890 --> 01:12:23.227
But he was hooked up
to all these tubes,

01:12:24.694 --> 01:12:27.664
and he just didn't
look like himself.

01:12:28.566 --> 01:12:30.733
I got scared,

01:12:31.668 --> 01:12:33.871
and I didn't go in.

01:12:36.841 --> 01:12:38.040
That's when I decided

01:12:38.042 --> 01:12:41.178
I was never gonna be
scared ever again.

01:12:45.950 --> 01:12:48.786
Oh. Looks like
we're coming up on somethin'.

01:12:58.628 --> 01:13:00.264
The final gauntlet.

01:13:12.843 --> 01:13:15.678
The Phoenix Gem
is just on the other side.

01:13:18.549 --> 01:13:21.550
Careful, there could be
booby traps.

01:13:21.552 --> 01:13:23.552
This place is, like,
1,000 years old.

01:13:23.554 --> 01:13:24.989
There's no way
there could be...

01:13:31.595 --> 01:13:33.030
Oh, no.

01:13:34.131 --> 01:13:35.698
It can't be.

01:13:37.401 --> 01:13:39.270
A gelatinous cube!

01:13:45.910 --> 01:13:46.842
Run!

01:13:46.844 --> 01:13:47.943
Whoa! Wait!
It's some kind of puzzle.

01:13:47.945 --> 01:13:49.311
We gotta
figure it out before...

01:13:49.313 --> 01:13:50.745
No time.
Grab a shield.

01:14:03.060 --> 01:14:05.196
- Jump! Trust me!
- What?

01:14:07.298 --> 01:14:08.399
<i>Aloft Elevar!</i>

01:14:11.669 --> 01:14:12.870
Ow.

01:14:14.505 --> 01:14:15.705
Ian.

01:14:25.683 --> 01:14:27.049
Whew!

01:14:27.051 --> 01:14:29.286
Don't step on that.

01:14:31.922 --> 01:14:34.191
I didn't touch it.

01:14:38.195 --> 01:14:39.296
<i>Voltar Thundasir!</i>

01:14:47.004 --> 01:14:49.504
The tile down there has the
same shape as the opening.

01:14:49.506 --> 01:14:50.939
Maybe we were supposed
to step on it?

01:14:50.941 --> 01:14:52.207
- What?
- I got it.

01:14:52.209 --> 01:14:53.210
No, Barley!

01:15:00.551 --> 01:15:01.885
Oh! It's working!

01:15:04.855 --> 01:15:07.823
It's impossible.

01:15:07.825 --> 01:15:10.492
No one can hold
their breath that long.

01:15:43.794 --> 01:15:45.294
We made it!

01:15:45.296 --> 01:15:46.328
Oh.

01:15:46.330 --> 01:15:49.331
The Phoenix Gem
awaits beyond this door.

01:15:49.333 --> 01:15:50.565
Shall we?

01:15:50.567 --> 01:15:52.234
We certainly shall!

01:15:52.236 --> 01:15:54.136
Dad, we have followed
the quest,

01:15:54.138 --> 01:15:57.308
and it has led us
to our victory!

01:16:16.393 --> 01:16:17.959
We're back home.

01:16:17.961 --> 01:16:20.996
No, that doesn't make sense.
We took the Path of Peril.

01:16:20.998 --> 01:16:22.097
We followed the ravens,

01:16:22.099 --> 01:16:24.099
we went to the end
of the water...

01:16:24.101 --> 01:16:26.735
Unless the X meant
stay away from the water.

01:16:26.737 --> 01:16:28.805
Or it could be,
like, a campfire?

01:16:28.807 --> 01:16:30.172
It's okay.
We can figure this out.

01:16:30.174 --> 01:16:32.874
Figure out what?
We're back where we started.

01:16:32.876 --> 01:16:34.376
I mean, it has to be here.
There was a gauntlet.

01:16:34.378 --> 01:16:36.178
I mean, unless that
gauntlet was for,

01:16:36.180 --> 01:16:38.046
coincidentally,
some different quest.

01:16:38.048 --> 01:16:39.314
- That's a possibility.
- What?

01:16:39.316 --> 01:16:42.119
No, no, no. This has to be
where the Phoenix Gem is.

01:16:42.920 --> 01:16:44.221
I followed my gut.

01:16:44.888 --> 01:16:47.723
- Oh, no.
- What?

01:16:47.725 --> 01:16:49.826
The gem is
in the mountain.

01:16:49.828 --> 01:16:51.693
The mountain
we could have been to

01:16:51.695 --> 01:16:53.695
hours ago
if we just...

01:16:53.697 --> 01:16:55.263
If we just stayed
on the expressway.

01:16:55.265 --> 01:16:57.099
No, the expressway
is too obvious.

01:16:57.101 --> 01:16:58.233
You can never take
the obvious...

01:16:58.235 --> 01:17:00.803
If I hadn't listened
to you! Okay?

01:17:00.805 --> 01:17:02.237
I can't believe this.

01:17:02.239 --> 01:17:04.740
You act like you know
what you're doing,

01:17:04.742 --> 01:17:06.108
but you don't
have a clue,

01:17:06.110 --> 01:17:09.244
and that's because
you are a screwup.

01:17:09.246 --> 01:17:10.813
And now you've
screwed up my chance

01:17:10.815 --> 01:17:12.616
to have the one thing
I never had!

01:17:19.056 --> 01:17:20.255
Where are you going?

01:17:20.257 --> 01:17:23.060
To spend what little time
we have left with Dad.

01:17:24.328 --> 01:17:26.328
Ian, wait!

01:17:26.330 --> 01:17:29.064
We can still find
the Phoenix Gem.

01:17:29.066 --> 01:17:31.301
We just have to
keep lookin'.

01:17:32.202 --> 01:17:33.570
Ian!

01:17:34.238 --> 01:17:35.506
Ian!

01:17:47.184 --> 01:17:48.417
No, Dad.

01:17:48.419 --> 01:17:49.553
He's not here.

01:18:01.432 --> 01:18:04.001
Come on. Where is it?

01:18:04.668 --> 01:18:06.069
Follow the water.

01:18:12.777 --> 01:18:13.843
Ugh...

01:18:13.845 --> 01:18:15.878
All right. Come on,
out of the fountain.

01:18:15.880 --> 01:18:18.046
No, I'm looking
for an ancient gem.

01:18:18.048 --> 01:18:20.015
Oh, yeah, we know.
"The old days."

01:18:20.017 --> 01:18:21.851
No! Stop! Please! No!

01:18:21.853 --> 01:18:23.118
Okay, ow, okay!

01:18:23.120 --> 01:18:25.187
Okay. I'm leaving.

01:18:25.189 --> 01:18:28.056
- Hey!
- Come on!

01:18:28.058 --> 01:18:31.426
Can someone call the cops?
We got the history buff again.

01:18:58.689 --> 01:19:00.489
- <i>I can't do this.</i>
- <i>Yes, you can.</i>

01:19:00.491 --> 01:19:03.360
- I'm not ready!
- You'll never be ready. Merge!

01:19:05.395 --> 01:19:06.597
<i>Nice job!</i>

01:19:14.973 --> 01:19:17.541
- Think fast.
- <i>Aloft Elevar!</i>

01:19:53.011 --> 01:19:55.043
Woo-hoo!

01:19:55.045 --> 01:19:56.578
<i>I know
you're stronger than that.</i>

01:19:56.580 --> 01:19:59.581
<i>My little brother
has the magic gift.</i>

01:19:59.583 --> 01:20:00.883
<i>Don't hold back.</i>

01:20:00.885 --> 01:20:02.719
<i>Hey. You can do this.</i>

01:20:29.513 --> 01:20:32.649
Okay, come on.
Get down right now.

01:20:55.305 --> 01:20:57.708
Yeah! Yeah!

01:21:03.680 --> 01:21:04.981
Barley!

01:21:04.983 --> 01:21:06.483
Ian! Look!

01:21:10.021 --> 01:21:11.254
Behind you!

01:21:14.491 --> 01:21:16.126
It's a curse.

01:22:09.981 --> 01:22:11.314
Barley, run!

01:22:15.285 --> 01:22:17.587
What do you want?
The gem?

01:22:18.655 --> 01:22:19.757
Fine, take it!

01:22:23.861 --> 01:22:24.862
Ha-ha!

01:22:45.917 --> 01:22:47.983
The Manticore!

01:22:47.985 --> 01:22:49.151
Mom?

01:22:49.153 --> 01:22:51.386
It's okay, boys,
we'll take care...

01:22:51.388 --> 01:22:53.856
Whoa... You're tilting!
You're tilting!

01:22:53.858 --> 01:22:56.125
- Mom!
- Go see your father!

01:22:56.127 --> 01:22:59.095
It's okay! If they stab
the beast's core

01:22:59.097 --> 01:23:01.229
with that sword,
the curse will be broken.

01:23:01.231 --> 01:23:02.499
Come on!

01:23:30.862 --> 01:23:33.796
Barley, what I said before...
I am so sorry.

01:23:33.798 --> 01:23:35.867
There's no time.
The sun's about to set.

01:23:37.667 --> 01:23:39.969
Only once is all we get,
grant me this rebirth.

01:23:39.971 --> 01:23:43.775
Till tomorrow's sun has set,
one day to walk the earth!

01:23:46.878 --> 01:23:48.813
Time to crush a curse!

01:23:55.619 --> 01:23:57.587
Ooh, my back.

01:24:02.894 --> 01:24:04.594
I am a mighty warrior.

01:24:14.437 --> 01:24:17.041
I am a mighty warrior!

01:24:23.114 --> 01:24:25.682
Hurry! I can't
hold this for long!

01:24:31.889 --> 01:24:34.091
No! No, no, no! Barley!

01:24:58.115 --> 01:25:00.117
Boys, it's coming back!

01:25:05.589 --> 01:25:06.922
I'll go distract it.

01:25:06.924 --> 01:25:08.057
What? No!

01:25:08.059 --> 01:25:09.490
If you do that,
you'll miss Dad.

01:25:09.492 --> 01:25:12.864
It's okay.
Say hi to Dad for me.

01:25:14.232 --> 01:25:17.333
- No. You go and say goodbye.
- What?

01:25:17.335 --> 01:25:19.802
I had someone
who looked out for me.

01:25:19.804 --> 01:25:21.736
Someone who
pushed me to be

01:25:21.738 --> 01:25:24.206
more than I ever
thought I could be.

01:25:24.208 --> 01:25:26.010
I never had a dad,

01:25:26.978 --> 01:25:28.846
but I always had you.

01:25:37.889 --> 01:25:39.556
<i>Bridgrigar Invisia!</i>

01:25:41.158 --> 01:25:42.592
<i>Boombastia!</i>

01:25:52.103 --> 01:25:53.369
<i>Aloft Elevar!</i>

01:26:08.286 --> 01:26:09.486
No!

01:26:17.361 --> 01:26:18.561
No! No, no, no!

01:26:21.132 --> 01:26:21.997
Use what I have.

01:26:21.999 --> 01:26:24.366
Uh, what do I have?
I have nothing.

01:26:24.368 --> 01:26:27.269
Splinter.
Magic in every fiber.

01:26:27.271 --> 01:26:29.439
<i>Magnora Gantuan!</i>

01:26:31.142 --> 01:26:34.611
No!
<i>Voltar Thundasir!</i>

01:26:41.385 --> 01:26:42.585
Ian!

01:26:43.321 --> 01:26:44.688
<i>Accelior!</i>

01:27:10.114 --> 01:27:11.514
Ian!

01:29:00.057 --> 01:29:01.325
What did he say?

01:29:02.860 --> 01:29:05.894
He said he always thought
his wizard name

01:29:05.896 --> 01:29:09.164
would be
Wilden the Whimsical.

01:29:09.166 --> 01:29:12.167
Wow. That's really terrible.

01:29:12.169 --> 01:29:13.936
I know.

01:29:16.440 --> 01:29:19.475
He also said
he's very proud

01:29:19.477 --> 01:29:22.712
of the person
you grew up to be.

01:29:23.613 --> 01:29:27.918
Well, I owe an awful
lot of that to you.

01:29:29.520 --> 01:29:32.089
He kinda
said that, too.

01:29:34.792 --> 01:29:38.095
Oh, and he told me
to give you this.

01:30:06.857 --> 01:30:10.161
<i>Long ago,
the world was full of wonder.</i>

01:30:12.662 --> 01:30:16.064
<i>It was adventurous,
exciting,</i>

01:30:16.066 --> 01:30:19.635
<i>and best of all,
there was magic.</i>

01:30:22.339 --> 01:30:24.973
Whoa! Watch it!

01:30:24.975 --> 01:30:28.010
Bullseye!

01:30:28.012 --> 01:30:30.345
And then, with a slash
of my mighty sword,

01:30:30.347 --> 01:30:33.450
I severed the beast's wings
from its wretched body!

01:30:34.585 --> 01:30:37.886
Okay, who wants cake?

01:30:40.991 --> 01:30:44.092
And I think, with a little
bit of magic in your life,

01:30:44.094 --> 01:30:46.028
you can do
almost anything.

01:30:46.030 --> 01:30:48.297
Is that how you put the
school back together?

01:30:48.299 --> 01:30:49.231
Uh, yes.

01:30:49.233 --> 01:30:50.666
Is that also
how you destroyed

01:30:50.668 --> 01:30:52.167
the school
in the first place?

01:30:52.169 --> 01:30:53.802
Uh, also yes.

01:30:55.573 --> 01:30:57.940
- Hey, that was great.
- Thanks.

01:30:57.942 --> 01:31:00.844
- You going to the park later?
- Yeah! See you there.

01:31:05.748 --> 01:31:07.416
Mom! Oof!

01:31:09.653 --> 01:31:10.919
Blazey, down!

01:31:10.921 --> 01:31:12.888
Who's a good dragon?
Who's a good dragon?

01:31:12.890 --> 01:31:14.289
So, how was school?

01:31:14.291 --> 01:31:15.723
It was really good.

01:31:15.725 --> 01:31:16.892
Well, all right.

01:31:16.894 --> 01:31:18.860
Hey, there he is.
You workin' hard?

01:31:18.862 --> 01:31:21.296
No, hardly workin'.

01:31:21.298 --> 01:31:24.933
Oh, I gotta go. I'm meeting
the Manticore for a night out.

01:31:24.935 --> 01:31:26.802
<i>We got
a one-one-three in progress.</i>

01:31:26.804 --> 01:31:28.036
<i>All units report.</i>

01:31:28.038 --> 01:31:30.305
Duty calls.
Time to hit the trails.

01:31:30.307 --> 01:31:31.640
Oh, you forgot
your keys!

01:31:31.642 --> 01:31:35.244
Don't need 'em.
I was born to run.

01:31:35.246 --> 01:31:36.313
Hyah!

01:31:40.751 --> 01:31:41.952
Oh!

01:31:42.720 --> 01:31:44.955
Ah.

01:31:46.323 --> 01:31:47.756
So, how's
the new van?

01:31:47.758 --> 01:31:50.058
Oh. Guinevere the Second
is great.

01:31:50.060 --> 01:31:52.794
I've almost got enough saved
up for a sweet paint job.

01:31:52.796 --> 01:31:54.963
- No, please don't.
- Why not?

01:31:54.965 --> 01:31:57.534
Because I already
took care of it.

01:31:58.802 --> 01:32:01.105
Oh, yeah!

01:32:02.873 --> 01:32:04.873
