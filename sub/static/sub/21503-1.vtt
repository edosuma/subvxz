01:12:11.528 --> 01:12:13.094
          I love you.           

01:12:16.366 --> 01:12:18.066
        I love you, too.        

01:12:19.135 --> 01:12:22.603
            [crying]

      [siren approaching]       

01:12:50.700 --> 01:12:53.501
    The girls would kill me     
  for recommending it, but...   

01:12:53.503 --> 01:12:55.837
    ...we should go to your     
uncle's house for spring break. 

01:12:55.839 --> 01:12:57.038
            Act like            
    it's your idea, though.     

01:12:58.608 --> 01:12:59.858
             Okay?              

01:12:59.859 --> 01:13:01.109
            [Woman]             
 So she's under the impression  
     that her dead brother      

01:13:01.111 --> 01:13:03.044
   killed all of her friends.   

01:13:03.046 --> 01:13:05.079
     She's clearly insane.      

01:13:05.715 --> 01:13:07.715
No concrete evidence points her 
       to these murders,        

01:13:07.717 --> 01:13:09.617
       or the last batch.       

01:13:09.619 --> 01:13:11.219
         You're right.          

01:13:11.221 --> 01:13:13.988
  What she is... is dangerous.  

01:13:15.191 --> 01:13:16.491
          So now what?          

01:13:16.926 --> 01:13:18.259
          Honestly...           

01:13:20.430 --> 01:13:24.866
  This girl enters an entirely  
    new realm of fucked up.

            [sighs]             

01:13:30.306 --> 01:13:32.273
      I need some coffee.       

01:13:32.275 --> 01:13:33.374
           You want?            

01:13:33.376 --> 01:13:34.709
        Black as night.         

01:13:40.216 --> 01:13:41.716
    What are you thinking...    

01:13:43.086 --> 01:13:45.720
  ...you crazy fuckin' bitch.
