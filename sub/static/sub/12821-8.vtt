00:00.700 --> 00:02.735
<i>Previously on "zero hour"...</i>

00:02.737 --> 00:04.269
My wife lied to me
and i never suspected.

00:04.271 --> 00:06.672
The shepherds have struggled
to protect the cross

00:06.674 --> 00:08.240
From a group known as the pyrates.

00:08.242 --> 00:10.442
I'm confident to have
the cross in my possession

00:10.444 --> 00:12.077
By the end of the week.

00:12.079 --> 00:14.146
I wanted you to know that
we're in this together.

00:14.148 --> 00:17.116
<i>I saw something. He
looked exactly like me.</i>

00:17.118 --> 00:19.451
Korbin sturm--He was
conscripted into the nazi party

00:19.453 --> 00:21.553
For field research on zero hour.

00:21.555 --> 00:23.689
We need you to unlock this puzzle.

00:23.691 --> 00:26.725
Strasbourg--That's
where the clocks lead.

00:26.727 --> 00:28.127
God forgive me.

00:29.096 --> 00:30.596
Stop!

00:30.598 --> 00:34.433
I'm gonna find the true cross
and i'm gonna destroy it.

00:34.435 --> 00:36.235
Come with me.

00:36.237 --> 00:37.736
The signal says they're here.

<i>7 is
holy--</i>

00:51.252 --> 00:53.485
<i>The number of god evermore.</i>

00:53.487 --> 00:56.622
<i>We are brothers in this life</i>

00:56.624 --> 00:58.791
<i>And maybe once before.</i>

01:03.496 --> 01:06.432
Halt! Halt!

01:08.501 --> 01:10.169
Halt!

01:10.171 --> 01:11.670
Halt!

01:27.387 --> 01:29.455
The nazis cannot be stopped now.

01:29.457 --> 01:30.789
They will come for us.

01:30.791 --> 01:32.624
Then we must fight back.

01:32.626 --> 01:34.693
We are too weak to fight back.

01:34.695 --> 01:36.528
But we may not be in the future.

01:36.530 --> 01:38.797
As rosicrucians, we know
the most important thing

01:38.799 --> 01:41.133
For us to do now is
to preserve that thing

01:41.135 --> 01:43.836
That lies in the tunnels
below this cathedral.

01:45.206 --> 01:47.339
We can't do this.

01:47.341 --> 01:49.875
A hundred generations
have kept it hidden.

01:49.877 --> 01:52.511
We're not worthy to make this decision.

01:52.513 --> 01:55.114
If we don't and it
falls into nazi hands,

01:55.116 --> 01:58.250
It will mean the end of
mankind as we know it.

02:05.125 --> 02:07.126
I am receiving you. Over.

02:07.128 --> 02:09.527
They've mobilized the
troops for the cathedral.

02:09.530 --> 02:12.431
Then it's only a matter of
time till they find the cross.

02:12.433 --> 02:14.266
I'll be ahead of them.

02:14.268 --> 02:16.268
It is now time for you to do your part.

02:16.270 --> 02:19.171
We'll be ready to take on the cargo.

02:19.173 --> 02:20.472
A crew of the most faithful,

02:20.474 --> 02:23.909
Ready to die so the cross might endure.

02:23.911 --> 02:26.411
And you? Are you ready?

02:26.413 --> 02:29.515
With eternity itself at stake,

02:29.517 --> 02:32.584
I only wish i had more
than one life to give.

02:32.586 --> 02:34.786
To eternity.

02:34.788 --> 02:37.189
To eternity.

02:48.235 --> 02:49.468
Keep your head down.

02:49.470 --> 02:50.903
The shepherds have eyes everywhere.

02:50.905 --> 02:52.604
And stay close.

02:52.606 --> 02:54.573
I'll teach you how to avoid the cameras.

02:54.575 --> 02:55.774
Yeah, how to change my identity,

02:55.776 --> 02:57.209
How to shoot a gun.

02:57.211 --> 02:58.377
Hank...

02:58.379 --> 02:59.945
I don't want to be like you, laila.

02:59.947 --> 03:01.480
Yeah, well, if you want
to make it through today,

03:01.482 --> 03:03.215
You're gonna have to be.

03:03.217 --> 03:05.584
Look, i am not proud of
everything i've done--

03:05.586 --> 03:07.286
Then why did you do it?

03:07.288 --> 03:10.222
Oh, that's right. God told you to.

03:10.224 --> 03:12.691
Yeah, is that so hard to believe?

03:12.693 --> 03:14.526
Can you honestly say

03:14.528 --> 03:15.694
That nothing that you've seen or heard

03:15.696 --> 03:17.196
Over the last
few weeks--

03:17.198 --> 03:18.530
None of that feels like a sign to you?

03:18.532 --> 03:19.865
<i>Hey, mes amis.</i>

03:19.867 --> 03:21.466
I'll take your bag, please? Yes.

03:21.468 --> 03:24.970
Uh, best ride, best
price, best everything.

03:24.972 --> 03:25.938
<i>Hey? Oui.</i>

03:29.376 --> 03:30.876
Regardless of what i've done,

03:30.878 --> 03:33.946
What i am doing now, i'm
doing to save your life

03:33.948 --> 03:36.215
So that maybe
you and i--

03:36.217 --> 03:37.716
Okay, we're not gonna
make this about you and me.

03:37.718 --> 03:39.985
There is no you and me, you understand?

03:39.987 --> 03:42.221
We are just two people
with a common goal

03:42.223 --> 03:43.956
To find the cross.

03:43.958 --> 03:46.225
<i>Where to, mes amis?</i>

03:46.227 --> 03:48.293
Strasbourg cathedral.

03:48.295 --> 03:50.462
Ah. Yeah.

03:57.537 --> 03:59.471
Got a hit.

03:59.473 --> 04:00.872
One of laila
galliston's aliases--

04:00.874 --> 04:02.574
Booked a flight to
dublin, left six hours ago.

04:02.576 --> 04:05.844
Move on it. Interpol, irish, everybody.

04:05.846 --> 04:07.346
I think you should hold up on that, sir.

04:07.348 --> 04:08.947
There is a bigger picture here.

04:08.949 --> 04:10.282
The only picture i'm thinking about

04:10.284 --> 04:11.850
Is the one of a dead priest

04:11.852 --> 04:13.885
And of a man that you've been
spending a lot of time with

04:13.887 --> 04:16.021
Who fled the crime scene

04:16.023 --> 04:19.291
With a missing woman who you've
been supposedly hunting down.

04:19.293 --> 04:20.625
You got dublin yet?

04:20.628 --> 04:22.594
Better call athens while you're at it.

04:22.596 --> 04:25.530
Booked a reservation
on a flight to athens.

04:25.532 --> 04:26.965
Another one to la paz, bolivia.

04:26.967 --> 04:28.900
I got mozambique, krakow.

04:31.671 --> 04:33.772
Who the hell is this woman?

04:33.774 --> 04:35.607
Laila galliston,

04:35.609 --> 04:37.743
Anna massey.

04:37.745 --> 04:40.345
The rest of the aliases
are coming to you.

04:40.347 --> 04:43.382
The moment is upon us.

04:43.384 --> 04:46.018
For the first time in history,

04:46.020 --> 04:49.021
God himself is now at risk.

04:49.023 --> 04:51.990
There is to be no
negotiation, no dialogue.

04:51.992 --> 04:55.027
Just death and proof of death.

04:55.029 --> 04:58.530
Both hank and laila galliston die today.

04:59.867 --> 05:01.933
Something feels nasty, ray.

05:01.935 --> 05:03.302
Hank's off the reservation

05:03.304 --> 05:04.670
And his phone keeps going to voice mail.

05:04.672 --> 05:05.971
Hank knows what he's doing.

05:05.973 --> 05:08.006
I don't know. Something feels different.

05:08.008 --> 05:09.808
Women can make men do stupid things.

05:09.810 --> 05:11.343
Did i ever tell you about that night

05:11.345 --> 05:12.711
I ran around times
square wearing nothing

05:12.713 --> 05:14.980
But a bike helmet and bunny slippers?

05:16.784 --> 05:17.916
Hello?

05:17.918 --> 05:20.018
Hey, rachel. It's me. Hank.

05:20.020 --> 05:22.521
I-I just want to let you
guys know that i'm fine.

05:22.523 --> 05:26.458
Hank, hank, you cannot
trust her, okay? She--

05:26.460 --> 05:28.694
She knows the score, and so do i.

05:28.696 --> 05:29.861
Where are you?

05:29.863 --> 05:31.029
Strasbourg, but listen to me.

05:31.031 --> 05:32.998
Okay, the shepherds are desperate now.

05:33.000 --> 05:33.965
They will come for you.

05:33.967 --> 05:35.801
I want you to go to the fbi

05:35.803 --> 05:37.469
And find beck, okay?

05:37.471 --> 05:38.637
She can protect you.

05:38.639 --> 05:39.871
I'm not so sure about that.

05:39.873 --> 05:41.039
Why not?

05:41.041 --> 05:43.508
Right before the fbi raided them.

05:43.510 --> 05:45.043
I heard the phone call, hank.

05:45.045 --> 05:47.512
Are you saying there's--They
have somebody on the inside?

05:47.514 --> 05:48.980
I'm saying, until we know who did it,

05:48.982 --> 05:50.849
We can't trust anyone
in the fbi, not even--

05:50.851 --> 05:52.117
Beck.

05:53.353 --> 05:55.087
Mr. Ryan, i'll have to call you back.

05:55.089 --> 05:58.023
All right, people. It
just became the weekend.

05:58.025 --> 05:59.591
Let's go.

05:59.593 --> 06:01.593
Except you two.

06:07.533 --> 06:10.035
Your cross was loaded on a sub

06:10.037 --> 06:14.072
Somewhere here in this area.

06:14.074 --> 06:17.008
And we know eventually,
the sub ends up here,

06:17.010 --> 06:19.077
Without the cross.

06:19.079 --> 06:21.380
Assuming that

06:21.382 --> 06:23.515
The fuel log was accurate,

06:23.517 --> 06:25.117
It has to be somewhere

06:25.119 --> 06:28.520
Between those locations.

06:28.522 --> 06:31.990
A few more days,

06:31.992 --> 06:33.625
You'll have your relic.

06:33.627 --> 06:36.928
Oh, i'll have much more
than that, mr. Vincent.

06:36.930 --> 06:39.064
When you leave tonight,

06:39.066 --> 06:40.899
I want you to take someone with you.

06:40.901 --> 06:42.167
Well, i work alone.

06:42.169 --> 06:43.535
The care and discretion

06:43.537 --> 06:45.670
The holiest of holies requires

06:45.672 --> 06:47.606
Is beyond your purview.

06:47.608 --> 06:50.609
I believe you two
already know each other.

06:50.611 --> 06:52.778
Come in.

06:56.682 --> 06:58.784
Molars.

06:58.786 --> 07:01.953
My old friend. Happy to see me?

07:04.424 --> 07:06.558
With all deliberate haste, vincent.

07:06.560 --> 07:09.461
The shepherds aren't that far behind.

07:09.463 --> 07:11.463
The shepherds are chasing clocks

07:11.465 --> 07:12.631
And playing with puzzles.

07:12.633 --> 07:14.766
They no longer pose a threat.

07:19.972 --> 07:21.640
Just so we're clear,

07:21.642 --> 07:22.974
I was a foot soldier.

07:22.976 --> 07:24.576
I did what they told me to do.

07:24.578 --> 07:25.744
Right.

07:25.746 --> 07:27.212
You were just following orders?

07:27.214 --> 07:29.214
Where have i heard that before?

07:29.216 --> 07:31.783
That's my point.

07:31.785 --> 07:34.019
It's getting harder...

07:34.021 --> 07:37.722
And harder to work out
who the bad guys are.

07:37.724 --> 07:40.158
I think i have a pretty good idea.

07:40.160 --> 07:42.994
I'm here, hank. I chose you.

07:42.996 --> 07:45.096
I saved you.

07:45.098 --> 07:47.833
I know. I'm trying to figure out why.

07:47.835 --> 07:50.001
Why don't we start by
trying to figure out

07:50.003 --> 07:53.872
Why those clocks lead back here?

07:56.175 --> 07:58.176
Suddenly i'm...

07:58.178 --> 08:01.079
Thinking i have a pretty damn good idea.

08:10.990 --> 08:13.592
Those two you were looking for,

08:13.594 --> 08:15.527
I just dropped them off.

08:16.963 --> 08:19.598
If you want to know where they are,

08:19.600 --> 08:21.533
Pay up.

08:51.964 --> 08:53.131
Let me guess.

08:53.133 --> 08:54.966
You're supposed to be good cop.

08:54.968 --> 08:56.735
Yep. Just like you see on tv.

08:56.737 --> 08:58.770
Well, how come i don't get bad cop?

08:58.772 --> 08:59.971
You think you could handle it?

08:59.973 --> 09:02.073
I mean, you're no serpico.

09:02.075 --> 09:04.809
I could go serpico if you want me to.

09:04.811 --> 09:06.778
Do you know where she is?

09:06.780 --> 09:08.246
No.

09:08.248 --> 09:10.181
Have you spoken with him?

09:10.183 --> 09:11.683
No.

09:11.685 --> 09:14.986
And just assume i'm gonna
say "no" to everything?

09:14.988 --> 09:17.055
Look, this is not
about me being good cop

09:17.057 --> 09:18.590
Or whatever.

09:18.592 --> 09:22.294
And his life could literally
depend on us finding him.

09:22.296 --> 09:25.597
Or he could be in worse
danger if you do find him.

09:25.599 --> 09:26.865
What's that supposed to mean?

09:26.867 --> 09:28.199
You tell me.

09:28.201 --> 09:30.201
Rachel, there is no version

09:30.203 --> 09:32.637
Where you haven't spoken with him.

09:32.639 --> 09:35.640
He trusts you a hell of a lot
more than he trusts that woman.

09:35.642 --> 09:37.576
Is that jealousy by any chance?

09:37.578 --> 09:39.644
That's experience.

09:39.646 --> 09:41.713
Why do you want him so bad?

09:41.715 --> 09:44.282
To be honest, right now...

09:44.284 --> 09:46.351
I don't really care about hank.

09:46.353 --> 09:48.053
He wants to make his bed, fine.

09:48.055 --> 09:49.955
Laila on the other hand,

09:49.957 --> 09:51.823
We have unfinished business.

09:52.993 --> 09:54.726
She knows what happened to my husband.

09:54.728 --> 09:57.829
And i'm thinking that she
has answers for you, too.

09:57.831 --> 10:00.298
So why don't we help each other?

10:03.736 --> 10:06.705
What is going on, rachel?

10:06.707 --> 10:09.107
Have i not proved myself to you?

10:09.109 --> 10:11.977
I've risked my job and
my life for you guys.

10:11.979 --> 10:13.678
And now that i need something from you,

10:13.680 --> 10:16.314
This is what i get?

10:16.316 --> 10:19.818
You're gonna have to do a
little housecleaning first.

10:19.820 --> 10:22.053
What's that supposed to mean?

10:22.055 --> 10:24.055
It means someone in the fbi

10:24.057 --> 10:26.057
Is passing notes with the shepherds.

10:26.059 --> 10:28.126
The raid
yesterday--

10:28.128 --> 10:30.729
They sure seemed ready
for it, didn't they?

10:30.731 --> 10:32.764
And you think i tipped them off?

10:32.766 --> 10:34.799
Who else knew about it?

10:45.177 --> 10:46.678
You want to hide a secret,

10:46.680 --> 10:48.279
The ultimate secret,

10:48.281 --> 10:51.850
You do it in something like this.

10:57.189 --> 10:58.923
Look. Right there.

10:58.925 --> 11:00.425
Rosicrucians.

11:02.395 --> 11:04.763
"The pilgrim that would seek god

11:04.765 --> 11:05.930
"In eternity

11:05.932 --> 11:08.266
"Must see the two faces of time.

11:08.268 --> 11:11.870
How it is both stopped
and moving at once."

11:11.872 --> 11:16.941
"In that combination lies
the road to all that is holy."

11:26.453 --> 11:27.986
Right on the hour.

11:27.988 --> 11:29.788
After all these centuries,

11:29.790 --> 11:31.089
Still right on the hour.

11:31.091 --> 11:32.257
Excuse me.

11:32.259 --> 11:33.992
The figurines, who are they?

11:33.994 --> 11:36.127
The 12 apostles.

11:48.874 --> 11:52.010
Look... there, that symbol.

11:52.012 --> 11:54.345
The builder's square. It's
the mark of st. Thomas.

11:54.347 --> 11:57.082
White vincent showed it
to me on the pocket watch.

11:57.084 --> 11:58.783
He asked me if i knew what it was.

11:58.785 --> 12:00.919
Right. And there, that's
the mark of st. Bartholomew.

12:00.921 --> 12:02.087
It was on the clock that you bought

12:02.089 --> 12:03.421
At the flea market.

12:03.423 --> 12:05.757
But what does it all mean?

12:05.759 --> 12:07.926
I think each one of these clocks

12:07.928 --> 12:09.461
Is supposed to match up

12:09.463 --> 12:11.863
With a clock we found out there.

12:11.865 --> 12:14.432
But how?

12:16.836 --> 12:19.237
Don't move.

12:21.208 --> 12:22.774
Hold still. What's wrong?

12:26.011 --> 12:27.879
Oh, lord. Please no.

12:28.781 --> 12:30.115
Do you know him?

12:30.117 --> 12:31.282
I know of him.

12:31.284 --> 12:33.918
But if he knows you,
you're already dead.

12:55.007 --> 12:56.775
<i>Oh, monsieur, excusez-Moi.</i>

12:56.777 --> 12:59.177
You can't walk through there. Hey, sir.

13:29.341 --> 13:33.311
Do you remember when you
used to make tea for me?

13:39.518 --> 13:43.488
It feels like a
lifetime ago, doesn't it?

13:43.490 --> 13:45.490
Yes.

13:45.492 --> 13:48.593
Well, we had our differences.

13:48.595 --> 13:52.831
But i loved the way you brewed tea.

13:52.833 --> 13:56.868
I even had a dream about your tea once.

13:58.170 --> 14:00.071
Some people say

14:00.073 --> 14:03.908
Tea in a dream signifies
a desire for companionship.

14:03.910 --> 14:06.144
Well...

14:07.479 --> 14:10.915
I don't dream about tea anymore.

14:12.985 --> 14:16.855
Now i dream about a man with a gun...

14:16.857 --> 14:19.190
A face i can't see.

14:19.192 --> 14:21.826
And he shoots me right here.

14:25.631 --> 14:28.333
They say you can't die in your dreams

14:28.335 --> 14:30.969
Because you wake up.

14:30.971 --> 14:33.504
But i don't.

14:33.506 --> 14:35.506
Do you know what it does to a man

14:35.508 --> 14:38.243
To suffer the pain of death

14:38.245 --> 14:42.080
Every single night of his life?

14:44.049 --> 14:46.618
Oh.

14:46.620 --> 14:49.621
I came for a reason.

14:49.623 --> 14:51.089
Yes?

14:51.091 --> 14:52.590
I forgot.

14:52.592 --> 14:54.993
A-As you know, uh, ms. Lynch

14:54.995 --> 14:57.328
Brought me on to deal
with some of the more...

14:57.330 --> 15:00.164
Delicate aspects of the cross' recovery.

15:00.166 --> 15:01.499
And?

15:01.501 --> 15:04.235
I... took the...

15:04.237 --> 15:06.371
Liberty of applying those skills

15:06.373 --> 15:08.973
To some of the more
challenging, uh, pieces you found

15:08.975 --> 15:10.541
On the
submarine--

15:10.543 --> 15:12.310
Maps, journals.

15:12.312 --> 15:14.112
We dehumidified them...

15:15.448 --> 15:18.950
And structurally stabilized them.

15:18.952 --> 15:22.086
They should be legible now.

15:37.670 --> 15:43.007
We really should have
tea again someday, molars.

15:48.114 --> 15:53.051
<i>"I've become convinced that
i'm central to the effort</i>

15:53.053 --> 15:54.585
<i>To save the cross."</i>

15:55.956 --> 15:57.355
<i>"There are nobler souls</i>

15:57.357 --> 16:01.192
<i>"Like my brother-In-Faith
korbin sturm,</i>

16:01.194 --> 16:03.061
<i>"But it is only i,</i>

16:03.063 --> 16:04.562
<i>"The wolf of the sea,</i>

16:04.564 --> 16:11.669
<i>"And make it disappear
forever from evil hands.</i>

16:11.671 --> 16:14.172
<i>"We will die
for this--</i>

16:14.174 --> 16:16.274
"For commandeering a submarine,

16:16.276 --> 16:19.310
<i>For defying the reich."</i>

16:21.982 --> 16:24.549
<i>"The path of the martyr is not easy.</i>

16:24.551 --> 16:26.217
<i>"But in the company of believers,</i>

16:26.219 --> 16:27.685
<i>"Of brothers,</i>

16:27.687 --> 16:30.655
<i>It is possible."</i>

16:33.359 --> 16:36.661
<i>"I undertake this
mission as much for them</i>

16:36.663 --> 16:38.696
<i>As god."</i>

16:51.577 --> 16:54.112
Good to see you again, brother.

16:56.582 --> 17:00.018
You as well, brother.

17:09.627 --> 17:12.130
That man in the cathedral...

17:12.132 --> 17:14.332
A shepherd assassin known as the golem.

17:14.334 --> 17:16.666
He's a walking death sentence.

17:16.669 --> 17:18.202
They've marked us, hank.

17:18.204 --> 17:20.104
There's no way we can undo it now.

17:20.106 --> 17:21.239
Yeah, there is.

17:21.241 --> 17:23.074
We get the cross.

17:23.076 --> 17:25.175
We've done this.

17:25.178 --> 17:28.212
To them, you and the
cross cannot coexist.

17:28.214 --> 17:29.814
But why me, huh?

17:29.816 --> 17:32.116
I don't know.

17:32.118 --> 17:33.384
We've gotta destroy it.

17:33.386 --> 17:35.086
You think the church
is gonna be thankful

17:35.088 --> 17:37.055
That we desecrated their holiest relic,

17:37.057 --> 17:39.490
That they're just
gonna let us walk away?

17:39.492 --> 17:42.627
We have to get the cross to
people who can protect us,

17:42.629 --> 17:47.231
People who can submit it to
rigorous scientific analysis

17:47.233 --> 17:49.500
So we can find out once and for all

17:49.502 --> 17:51.669
Whether or not there's magic in it

17:51.671 --> 17:56.107
Or if it's just two
really old planks of wood.

17:56.109 --> 17:59.177
You don't like that plan, you can walk.

17:59.179 --> 18:01.312
Where?

18:01.314 --> 18:04.148
I've got nowhere else to go.

18:04.150 --> 18:06.551
Then let's start figuring it out.

18:15.728 --> 18:17.528
How you doing, hank?

18:19.198 --> 18:20.665
We need to see the clocks.

18:20.667 --> 18:21.833
You with her?

18:21.835 --> 18:23.167
Yes, i am.

18:23.169 --> 18:25.136
Listen, we're very near the end.

18:25.138 --> 18:27.338
I need-- I don't care
what you need, hank.

18:27.340 --> 18:28.840
I've been fighting for
you this whole time.

18:28.842 --> 18:30.541
I've been honest with
you this whole time,

18:30.543 --> 18:32.143
And you ditched me.

18:33.712 --> 18:35.179
You don't want to help hank,

18:35.181 --> 18:36.747
That's fine.

18:36.749 --> 18:38.616
But not he's not the only
one looking for answers,

18:38.618 --> 18:40.351
Am i right?

18:40.353 --> 18:42.186
I have them, beck.

18:42.188 --> 18:44.522
I can tell you about your husband,

18:44.524 --> 18:46.124
But only if i'm still breathing,

18:46.126 --> 18:49.160
For long if we don't get those clocks.

18:49.162 --> 18:51.896
You think i'm gonna
trust you? You're insane.

18:51.898 --> 18:54.632
It's either us or that
agency you work for,

18:54.634 --> 18:57.535
The one riddled with
big ears and loose lips.

19:00.839 --> 19:03.174
You don't know that.

19:03.176 --> 19:06.344
Faith is a lot stronger
than a government paycheck,

19:06.346 --> 19:08.479
Trust me.

19:11.783 --> 19:14.452
Everything all right out here, riley?

19:14.454 --> 19:16.487
Everything's fine. It's fine.

19:16.489 --> 19:17.922
She--She doesn't
know anything.

19:32.237 --> 19:35.806
Do you believe that
we have lived before?

19:35.808 --> 19:37.875
The universe has given
us no proof of that.

19:37.877 --> 19:41.679
But if we had...

19:41.681 --> 19:45.316
Do you think we're consigned by fate

19:45.318 --> 19:47.652
To be the same through time?

19:49.721 --> 19:52.623
For evil always to be evil,

19:52.625 --> 19:56.227
Good to always be good?

20:04.937 --> 20:06.270
As a mariner, i always thought

20:06.272 --> 20:09.907
I'd be buried on a hilltop somewhere...

20:09.909 --> 20:13.911
A view of the sea, east-Facing

20:13.913 --> 20:16.714
So the sun would rise on my grave

20:16.716 --> 20:18.950
And i'd be warm.

20:18.952 --> 20:21.986
Only thing man's guaranteed
in life is a death.

20:21.988 --> 20:24.889
And i'm ready for that.

20:24.891 --> 20:27.525
But this...

20:29.895 --> 20:32.330
You're telling me we
are going to bury it

20:32.332 --> 20:34.365
In the middle of nowhere?

20:34.367 --> 20:37.568
In a humble and anonymous place

20:37.570 --> 20:40.238
Where only the 12 will know to look.

20:40.240 --> 20:41.973
It's the true cross.

20:41.975 --> 20:44.775
It deserves grandeur.

20:45.978 --> 20:48.946
We can take it to
america, build a basilica.

20:48.948 --> 20:50.915
The plan has been set.

20:50.917 --> 20:52.850
Apostles have been chosen.

20:52.852 --> 20:55.286
The clocks are sent out.

20:55.288 --> 20:58.956
Lives have been lost
to build this chain.

20:58.958 --> 21:00.691
We cannot break it now.

21:00.693 --> 21:04.895
But to bury so beautiful a thing

21:04.897 --> 21:07.765
In the mud...

21:07.767 --> 21:09.934
Jesus said...

21:09.936 --> 21:13.337
"Split a piece of wood, i am there.

21:13.339 --> 21:14.839
"Lift a stone,

21:14.841 --> 21:17.575
You will find me there."

21:17.577 --> 21:21.012
What matters is, the cross is safe,

21:21.014 --> 21:24.949
Not whether it's wreathed in gold.

21:24.951 --> 21:28.519
Understand, brother,

21:28.521 --> 21:31.789
All loves within me pale

21:31.791 --> 21:36.460
For the one i feel
for what's in that box.

21:36.462 --> 21:39.063
And i pray

21:39.065 --> 21:41.332
To god for guidance

21:41.334 --> 21:44.335
That we are doing the right thing.

21:46.038 --> 21:49.473
God's not up there.

21:49.475 --> 21:51.575
He's here.

21:53.812 --> 21:56.013
Good night, brother.

22:00.452 --> 22:02.853
Two dead in france already?

22:02.855 --> 22:04.922
I told you, he doesn't negotiate.

22:04.924 --> 22:06.457
It's our position now,

22:06.459 --> 22:09.660
And he is the executor of our position.

22:09.662 --> 22:10.961
<i>Then why do we send one man?</i>

22:10.963 --> 22:13.097
<i>He's only the tip of the spear.</i>

22:13.099 --> 22:16.467
<i>We have eyes everywhere in strasbourg,</i>

22:16.469 --> 22:20.538
<i>Combing the streets, the hotels.</i>

22:59.711 --> 23:01.979
Thank god it's you.

23:03.081 --> 23:05.049
Did you bring the clocks?

23:05.051 --> 23:06.550
As soon as i get what i want,

23:06.552 --> 23:09.120
You'll get what you want.

23:09.122 --> 23:11.021
As discussed,

23:11.023 --> 23:14.058
Us two ladies are gonna
have a conversation.

23:16.528 --> 23:19.997
Before you even start...

23:19.999 --> 23:22.032
I like that man out there.

23:22.034 --> 23:25.169
I like those kids.

23:25.171 --> 23:28.139
You lie to me...

23:28.141 --> 23:30.141
And i will kill you

23:30.143 --> 23:32.743
If only to get you away from them.

23:36.014 --> 23:38.582
Your husband was a bioengineer

23:38.584 --> 23:42.019
Worked on ways to preserve
fossilized plants--

23:42.021 --> 23:43.954
Let's begin with something i don't know,

23:43.956 --> 23:46.023
Like why you were supposed
to be sitting next to him

23:46.025 --> 23:47.425
On his flight.

23:48.994 --> 23:51.095
Your husband received a research grant

23:51.097 --> 23:52.963
From an organization
called the 41 trust,

23:52.965 --> 23:56.500
Who we believe are a
front for the pyrates.

23:56.502 --> 23:58.769
When they make a significant
financial investment

23:58.771 --> 24:00.538
In something or someone,

24:00.540 --> 24:02.106
We want to know why.

24:02.108 --> 24:04.708
He never told me about any grant.

24:04.710 --> 24:07.478
The pyrates believed that
he'd discovered something

24:07.480 --> 24:09.513
That would help them achieve their goal.

24:09.515 --> 24:11.849
Which is?

24:11.851 --> 24:14.985
To bring about the end of days.

24:19.025 --> 24:22.993
Do you go to church, ms. Riley?

24:22.995 --> 24:24.094
Yeah, every sunday.

24:24.096 --> 24:25.663
So then you know,

24:25.665 --> 24:28.032
To the true believers,
that means deliverance.

24:28.034 --> 24:30.668
When the sinners burn and
the worthy go to heaven,

24:30.670 --> 24:32.002
Yeah, i know my bible.

24:32.004 --> 24:33.838
Okay, well, the pyrates believe

24:33.840 --> 24:36.207
That god gave man free
will, that through science,

24:36.209 --> 24:39.844
They will be the vessels that
bring about the apocalypse.

24:39.846 --> 24:43.013
And how was my husband's work
supposed to help them do that?

24:43.015 --> 24:44.682
I don't know.

24:46.184 --> 24:49.019
I was supposed to connect with theo,

24:49.021 --> 24:53.090
Make him see things the way we do.

24:53.092 --> 24:54.859
But i didn't get that chance.

24:54.861 --> 24:56.227
I missed the flight.

24:56.229 --> 24:58.696
And so since you couldn't have him,

24:58.698 --> 25:00.197
You decided nobody could?

25:00.199 --> 25:02.032
No, that plane crash was vincent.

25:02.034 --> 25:04.502
You've always been right about that.

25:04.504 --> 25:06.637
It just...

25:06.639 --> 25:09.139
It doesn't make sense.

25:09.141 --> 25:12.810
If the pyrates wanted
my husband so badly,

25:12.812 --> 25:14.945
Why would they murder him?

25:16.548 --> 25:18.148
I've been asking myself that question

25:18.150 --> 25:19.950
Till this very moment.

25:38.069 --> 25:40.671
I need a drink.

25:43.074 --> 25:45.042
So the riddle on the cathedral clock is,

25:45.044 --> 25:47.077
"The pilgrim that would
seek god in eternity

25:47.079 --> 25:49.647
Must see the two faces of time."

25:49.649 --> 25:52.783
"How it is both stopped
and moving at once.

25:52.785 --> 25:56.086
In that combination lies the
road to all that is holy."

25:56.088 --> 25:59.123
How can time be both stopped and moving?

25:59.125 --> 26:00.291
This one.

26:00.293 --> 26:02.693
I remember vincent wanted help with it.

26:02.695 --> 26:04.161
The gears, they were soldered.

26:04.163 --> 26:05.863
Soldered.

26:05.865 --> 26:07.631
Time stopped.

26:07.633 --> 26:09.266
Well, yeah, but they
were all stopped, right?

26:09.268 --> 26:11.302
I mean, none of them
actually worked anymore.

26:11.304 --> 26:12.670
Or maybe they were working

26:12.672 --> 26:14.138
Exactly as they were meant to.

26:14.140 --> 26:17.141
And the clocks in the
cathedral, they're still moving.

26:17.143 --> 26:18.842
"In that combination

26:18.844 --> 26:20.844
Lies the road to all that is holy."

26:20.846 --> 26:22.313
Okay, so how do we combine 'em?

26:22.315 --> 26:25.883
Not combine. In combination.

26:25.885 --> 26:27.685
Like a combination lock.

26:28.787 --> 26:29.954
Maybe we're supposed to set

26:29.956 --> 26:34.224
To the exact times of the
clocks that have stopped.

26:34.226 --> 26:35.759
And then what, it just opens

26:35.761 --> 26:37.161
And shows us where the cross is?

26:37.163 --> 26:38.996
Yeah, easy enough except
for the 20 french cops

26:38.998 --> 26:41.065
Guarding the crime
scene in the cathedral.

26:41.067 --> 26:42.666
We could always go
"american werewolf in paris"

26:42.668 --> 26:45.035
With it.

26:45.037 --> 26:47.938
Ancient tunnels underneath
the cities of france

26:47.940 --> 26:49.006
Where the lycan council would meet?

26:49.008 --> 26:51.675
"American werewolf," really, nobody?

26:51.677 --> 26:53.177
Oh. You don't think that was maybe

26:53.179 --> 26:55.379
Something the movie just made up?

26:55.381 --> 26:57.348
Well, i don't see why they
would just make that up.

26:57.350 --> 26:59.149
It's a movie about werewolves.

26:59.151 --> 27:00.851
He's right.

27:02.153 --> 27:04.188
They used to be burial crypts.

27:04.190 --> 27:06.190
If it wasn't sunday,
we could take a tour.

27:06.192 --> 27:08.158
Look, they go everywhere. See?

27:08.160 --> 27:10.060
One runs right under the cathedral.

27:10.062 --> 27:12.096
I guess this is where we part ways.

27:13.065 --> 27:14.231
We were never here.

27:14.233 --> 27:15.766
Wait.

27:15.768 --> 27:17.668
If we're gonna get in to this cathedral,

27:17.670 --> 27:19.003
We're gonna need you.

27:19.005 --> 27:20.037
Why is that?

27:20.039 --> 27:21.739
Because you're the only two

27:21.741 --> 27:24.241
That the shepherds won't be looking for.

27:26.177 --> 27:28.846
Gendarmes are closing up.

27:28.848 --> 27:31.949
There's a couple of guys posted outside.

27:31.951 --> 27:34.418
Currently there is no sign of a golem.

27:34.420 --> 27:36.253
Just one hour. That's all i ask.

27:36.255 --> 27:38.055
And then you can be on your way.

27:38.057 --> 27:39.923
And, beck, thank you.

27:39.925 --> 27:42.793
Next time i need your
help on a stakeout,

27:42.795 --> 27:44.228
Don't think i'm not

27:44.230 --> 27:45.663
Calling your ass.

27:45.665 --> 27:48.132
Copy that.

27:48.134 --> 27:51.168
So this is the entrance
to the catacombs.

27:51.170 --> 27:53.170
It's locked.

27:53.172 --> 27:56.140
We need to try and find
something to break that

27:56.142 --> 27:57.141
Or pick it somehow.

28:05.150 --> 28:06.684
What?

28:06.686 --> 28:10.220
Is that something they
taught you in sunday school?

28:13.091 --> 28:15.793
Look, if anybody comes,
just give us a call.

28:15.795 --> 28:18.262
I'm the one with the gun,
so you should call me.

28:23.034 --> 28:25.102
They're on their way in.

28:25.104 --> 28:27.705
There's only one way out

28:27.707 --> 28:30.374
And only a little girl in your way.

28:48.126 --> 28:49.893
So is there, uh,

28:49.895 --> 28:53.130
There something going on
with you and that girl paige?

28:53.132 --> 28:55.299
Really?

28:55.301 --> 28:58.168
You're gonna jump back in and play mom?

28:58.170 --> 29:00.337
Come on. That's not what
i'm trying to do. I just--

29:00.339 --> 29:02.172
You hurt hank so bad.

29:02.174 --> 29:03.741
Yeah,

29:03.743 --> 29:05.242
And you and rachel.

29:05.244 --> 29:06.810
And there's not a minute goes by

29:06.812 --> 29:08.145
That i don't
regret it, that--

29:08.147 --> 29:10.114
You can't regret something
that you lied about

29:10.116 --> 29:11.515
And plotted

29:11.517 --> 29:14.184
And hid from us for four years.

29:14.186 --> 29:16.253
I mean, even hearing you now...

29:17.490 --> 29:20.457
It's like every piece
of advice you gave,

29:20.459 --> 29:22.793
Every joke you told,

29:22.795 --> 29:26.130
Every time you said, "i love you, guys,"

29:26.132 --> 29:29.199
It wasn't even your voice saying it.

29:39.110 --> 29:40.410
It's this way.

29:40.412 --> 29:42.446
This should take us under the cathedral.

29:42.448 --> 29:46.483
<i>"I am a dead man walking, lord,</i>

29:46.485 --> 29:48.485
<i>"I know that.</i>

29:48.487 --> 29:52.022
<i>"I ask only for guidance.</i>

29:52.024 --> 29:55.392
<i>"For i am a mile below
the surface of the world,</i>

29:55.394 --> 29:57.427
<i>"Wracked with fear</i>

29:57.429 --> 30:00.063
<i>That i will do the wrong thing."</i>

30:06.171 --> 30:08.972
Why have we changed course?

30:08.974 --> 30:11.008
Because i'm no longer willing

30:11.010 --> 30:15.145
To relegate the greatest
religious symbol in history

30:15.147 --> 30:17.214
To ignominious burial.

30:17.216 --> 30:19.116
That is not your choice to make.

30:19.118 --> 30:21.518
I am the commander of
the submarine. It is.

30:21.520 --> 30:22.886
Commander, sir.
We're veering--

30:22.888 --> 30:24.154
And i am the commander of the mission!

30:24.156 --> 30:26.156
The church has spoken.

30:26.158 --> 30:28.091
The 12 have lost their way.

30:28.093 --> 30:30.060
The location of the
cross must be secret.

30:30.062 --> 30:32.329
If it is in public, it is in danger.

30:32.331 --> 30:34.865
Turn around.

30:34.867 --> 30:37.334
I have only one life to give.

30:37.336 --> 30:39.069
I've chosen my course.

30:39.071 --> 30:40.037
Don't do this, brother.

30:43.141 --> 30:45.509
You would shoot me,

30:45.511 --> 30:48.011
A friend so dear that
you call me brother?

30:48.013 --> 30:49.880
We're to die with the cross' secret.

30:49.882 --> 30:51.448
That has always been the plan.

30:51.450 --> 30:53.150
We divert from the path,

30:53.152 --> 30:55.219
The 12 will be unable to find it.

30:55.221 --> 30:57.020
We will know it's location,

30:57.022 --> 30:59.389
But our own knowledge will be a threat.

31:03.494 --> 31:07.064
I will not put it in the mud.

31:07.066 --> 31:11.201
Please, i tell you this one more time...

31:11.203 --> 31:12.970
Turn around.

31:12.972 --> 31:15.272
You had better shoot me.

31:15.274 --> 31:19.142
My conviction is as
deep as yours, brother.

31:19.144 --> 31:21.211
Don't do this, brother.

31:26.618 --> 31:28.218
Don't do this. Please.

31:34.159 --> 31:36.994
Armin, brother, forgive me.

31:41.266 --> 31:44.268
That grave on the hilltop...

31:44.270 --> 31:50.140
I always imagined something grand...

31:50.142 --> 31:53.043
For my children to weep...

31:53.045 --> 31:55.679
And exaggerate

31:55.681 --> 32:01.118
The glory of my accomplishments.

32:01.120 --> 32:05.689
Yet now i weep for something else.

32:05.691 --> 32:08.392
No need, brother.

32:08.394 --> 32:10.294
I am here.

32:10.296 --> 32:12.095
I wonder...

32:12.097 --> 32:16.600
Can men be brothers in heaven...

32:16.602 --> 32:19.202
When one killed the other?

32:40.391 --> 32:42.192
<i>"The crew mourns</i>

32:42.194 --> 32:44.695
<i>"The death of commander dietrich,</i>

32:44.697 --> 32:48.231
<i>"But also knows the mission
is bigger than a single man.</i>

32:48.233 --> 32:49.733
<i>"We continue our course</i>

32:49.735 --> 32:52.102
<i>"On a heading of north 5 degrees.</i>

32:52.104 --> 32:54.738
<i>Acting commander, martin krupp."</i>

33:14.692 --> 33:18.128
You guys keep an eye out.

33:20.231 --> 33:22.065
All right, there's got to
be some sort of access panel,

33:22.067 --> 33:24.301
A-A way to set the clocks.

33:24.303 --> 33:26.003
Here we go.

33:26.005 --> 33:27.671
This. This has gotta be it.

33:33.044 --> 33:34.211
This is it.

33:34.213 --> 33:36.113
Ready to turn back some time?

33:36.115 --> 33:39.116
There's nothing i'd like more.

33:45.423 --> 33:49.426
Um, okay. Where do we start?

33:51.162 --> 33:52.329
<i>James.</i>

33:52.331 --> 33:54.131
3:15.

33:54.133 --> 33:57.467
James 3:15.

33:57.469 --> 33:59.102
Got it.

34:03.042 --> 34:05.275
Keep going.

34:05.277 --> 34:07.210
Turn. Turn.

34:07.212 --> 34:10.179
And... stop.

34:14.652 --> 34:16.553
It's working.

34:18.090 --> 34:19.755
<i>What's next? Thaddeus.</i>

34:19.757 --> 34:21.792
Um... 2:11.

34:21.793 --> 34:24.161
Thaddeus.

34:24.163 --> 34:25.695
<i>Yes. Yes, thaddeus.</i>

34:29.668 --> 34:31.668
I did not think when i took this job

34:31.670 --> 34:34.471
That i'd be risking my
life all over the world.

34:36.174 --> 34:37.206
Scared?

34:38.643 --> 34:41.110
Well, i got you here to protect me.

34:41.112 --> 34:42.379
Right.

34:42.380 --> 34:45.081
I was hoping you'd be
the one to protect me.

34:47.753 --> 34:50.786
I am, ray.

34:50.789 --> 34:53.857
If anybody came at you,
i'd cut 'em in half.

35:11.409 --> 35:14.878
You'd fight for me?

35:14.880 --> 35:16.446
You're like a sister.

35:18.249 --> 35:19.549
Not like a sister.

35:19.551 --> 35:22.219
I didn't mean like a
"sister" sister. I mean--

35:22.221 --> 35:25.122
But you--You get me-- Quit
while you're ahead, okay?

35:29.328 --> 35:31.495
Come on, paige. Where are you?

35:36.535 --> 35:38.435
Son of a bitch.

35:50.214 --> 35:51.681
Excusez-Moi.

35:51.683 --> 35:53.216
Je suis de bureau federal
d'investigation americain.

35:53.218 --> 35:55.652
<i>Non.</i>

35:55.654 --> 35:58.155
Stop.

35:58.157 --> 35:59.523
All right. What's next?

35:59.525 --> 36:01.158
Okay, the
last one--

36:01.160 --> 36:04.261
<i>Matthew. It's in military time. 1821.</i>

36:04.263 --> 36:05.428
That's,
uh, 6--

36:05.430 --> 36:07.430
6:21.

36:07.432 --> 36:08.899
What?

36:08.901 --> 36:10.767
Matthew 18:21.

36:10.769 --> 36:13.436
It's a biblical verse about forgiveness.

36:13.438 --> 36:16.706
In it, the apostles ask jesus

36:16.708 --> 36:19.442
How many times someone
should be forgiven

36:19.444 --> 36:22.379
After they sin against another person.

36:22.381 --> 36:24.614
And jesus says a person
should be forgiven

36:24.616 --> 36:25.949
Not just seven times

36:25.951 --> 36:28.618
But 70 times 7.

36:31.455 --> 36:34.758
I'm only asking for one, hank.

36:34.760 --> 36:36.793
You don't give up, do you?

36:39.330 --> 36:42.332
Actually, i gave up everything.

36:46.204 --> 36:48.271
I forgive you.

36:59.817 --> 37:02.252
And... stop.

37:09.394 --> 37:10.994
I don't get it.

37:10.996 --> 37:14.231
That can't be it.

37:14.233 --> 37:15.699
I thought it was supposed to tell us

37:15.701 --> 37:18.001
Where the true cross is?

37:27.345 --> 37:30.547
Matthias. The 13th apostle.

37:41.959 --> 37:44.494
Hidden inside the clock

37:44.496 --> 37:46.930
All those years.

37:47.965 --> 37:50.767
If you don't mind,

37:50.769 --> 37:52.636
I'll take it.

38:00.478 --> 38:01.645
I said i'll take it.

38:01.647 --> 38:03.647
Paige, what are you doing?

38:03.649 --> 38:05.548
You went off the rails, girl.

38:05.550 --> 38:07.417
Shepherds gave you a life with meaning,

38:07.419 --> 38:08.585
And you pissed it away.

38:08.587 --> 38:09.753
You don't need to do this.

38:09.755 --> 38:11.388
Paige, please.

38:11.390 --> 38:12.689
Pray.

38:12.691 --> 38:14.024
Pray for your eternal salvation.

38:14.026 --> 38:15.392
Paige.

38:15.394 --> 38:16.760
On your knees, now!

38:16.762 --> 38:18.695
You can murder us standing up.

38:18.697 --> 38:21.564
I was trying to give you a way out.

38:22.734 --> 38:23.933
I was trying to save you.

38:31.443 --> 38:33.610
And we have our mole.

38:36.081 --> 38:38.315
That's a big smile for someone

38:38.317 --> 38:40.317
Who's about to tell me everything,

38:40.319 --> 38:43.586
Like who hired you,
who you're reporting to.

38:43.588 --> 38:46.323
Dead women don't ask questions.

38:50.962 --> 38:54.030
Stay back! Stop! Stop!

39:01.540 --> 39:03.106
Go! Go!

39:21.393 --> 39:24.661
Thank god. I thought you
weren't gonna come back.

39:24.663 --> 39:27.797
You gotta get me outta here.

39:27.799 --> 39:30.467
The cops are gonna ask questions.

39:40.811 --> 39:41.978
Well, there's only one land mass

39:41.980 --> 39:43.546
Where they could've hid the cross

39:43.548 --> 39:45.682
On a bearing of north 5
degrees from that location.

39:51.722 --> 39:53.022
Do you remember i told you about the man

39:53.024 --> 39:54.624
That kills me in my dreams,

39:54.626 --> 39:56.526
That i can't see his face?

39:58.162 --> 40:00.997
It seems to have come to me.

40:00.999 --> 40:02.532
Well, most scientific research

40:02.534 --> 40:04.434
Says dreams are just mental garbage

40:04.436 --> 40:06.403
Working its way out of the system.

40:06.405 --> 40:08.805
Or perhaps it's the past telling you

40:08.807 --> 40:11.474
That there's a debt that needs repaying.

40:11.476 --> 40:12.642
You know the man?

40:12.644 --> 40:14.744
I do.

40:16.547 --> 40:18.748
I did.

40:18.750 --> 40:22.619
<i>But only now i know about his sin.</i>

40:22.621 --> 40:26.790
<i>And for that sin, he's
going to have to die.</i>

40:26.792 --> 40:28.858
This is supposed to be the answer,

40:28.860 --> 40:30.627

40:43.909 --> 40:46.709
Surveillance spotted vincent

between iceland and ireland.

Latin.

40:58.557 --> 41:00.924
"True cross.

41:00.926 --> 41:03.893
