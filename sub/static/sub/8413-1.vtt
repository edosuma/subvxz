00:55.120 --> 00:58.640
My lord, time is short.
Leave now, I beg you.

00:58.720 --> 01:00.440
You'll be arrested.

01:00.520 --> 01:02.160
Fetch some candles.

01:03.080 --> 01:04.519
I'll be working late.

01:05.239 --> 01:07.400
And my usual glass of wine.

01:11.480 --> 01:13.680
<i>This world had to change.</i>

01:14.720 --> 01:17.840
<i>But the Revolution is now
a terror sweeping the land,</i>

01:17.960 --> 01:21.320
<i>and it's my turn to be swept aside.</i>

01:23.120 --> 01:26.880
<i>Old prejudices make men blind,
drive them mad...</i>

01:27.880 --> 01:31.680
<i>devour their hearts
and turn them into beasts.</i>

02:59.960 --> 03:02.360
<i>In the year 1764,</i>

03:02.640 --> 03:06.120
<i>the Beast reached our soil
and made it its own.</i>

03:06.760 --> 03:11.520
<i>A year later, its fame had spread
beyond the borders of our province,</i>

03:11.720 --> 03:15.920
<i>and it seemed no mortal
would ever overcome it.</i>

03:16.000 --> 03:17.920
<i>The Beast's assaults</i>

03:18.280 --> 03:22.240
<i>slowly sank the region of Gévaudan
into darkness.</i>

04:29.320 --> 04:30.440
Who goes there?

06:01.680 --> 06:03.000
What's he done?

06:04.640 --> 06:06.240
- What?
- He's a thief.

06:09.280 --> 06:10.200
And her?

06:10.280 --> 06:12.760
His daughter. Damned witch!

06:13.560 --> 06:16.120
I healed their horses. They owe me.

06:16.400 --> 06:18.560
Don't listen. They're liars!

06:18.640 --> 06:20.480
- Did he heal the horses?
- Yes.

06:32.880 --> 06:33.960
Begone!

06:57.120 --> 07:01.360
Welcome to the land of the Beast!
Beware of wolf traps!

07:04.320 --> 07:06.280
<i>Sir Grégoire de Fronsac</i>

07:06.520 --> 07:11.080
<i>and the man they called Mani
were neither hunters nor soldiers.</i>

07:11.200 --> 07:16.080
<i>A naturalist at the King's Garden,
Fronsac was a libertine</i>

07:16.240 --> 07:17.720
<i>and a fine wit.</i>

07:18.000 --> 07:20.320
<i>The man who shadowed him</i>

07:20.600 --> 07:23.880
<i>was a mysterious foreigner.</i>

07:25.840 --> 07:30.240
<i>At nightfall, the travelers arrived
at the castle of Marquis d'Apcher,</i>

07:30.680 --> 07:34.960
<i>their protector in Gévaudan
for the duration of their mission.</i>

08:02.360 --> 08:07.120
Our people fear no ordinary wolf.
The Beast is different.

08:08.000 --> 08:11.160
It flees men
as if it knew to fear them,

08:11.240 --> 08:13.440
yet spares no woman or child.

08:13.560 --> 08:15.360
Have you ever seen it?

08:16.240 --> 08:19.120
How do you know it's just one animal?

08:19.240 --> 08:22.080
The survivors all say the same.

08:22.600 --> 08:26.320
It's bigger than a wolf
and has no fear of firearms.

08:26.800 --> 08:29.200
I understand your skepticism.

08:30.400 --> 08:33.640
I don't believe any more than you
in dragons.

08:33.720 --> 08:36.240
I've had a report drawn up,

08:36.520 --> 08:40.240
a memoir of the Beast's crimes.

08:41.200 --> 08:42.919
Judge for yourself.

08:46.400 --> 08:49.520
You battled the English in New France?

08:49.920 --> 08:53.760
Yes, I went to study animals and nature.

08:54.760 --> 08:58.080
I returned with wounds
and a captain's rank.

09:00.480 --> 09:04.280
I've organized a hospital
for victims of the Beast,

09:04.400 --> 09:06.400
in an old priory.

09:07.680 --> 09:09.440
A woman from Lorciére.

09:09.840 --> 09:13.160
The Beast attacked her
coming from the fair.

09:13.240 --> 09:17.720
Two men saved her, the Beast fled,
but took half her face.

09:19.280 --> 09:23.080
Tell me, how is M. Buffon?

09:23.960 --> 09:25.600
And how fares Paris?

09:29.440 --> 09:31.960
And L'Ingénu? Have you read it?

09:32.080 --> 09:35.160
It's a bit late to discuss philosophy.

09:35.280 --> 09:38.280
Quite right. Let's speak of theater.

09:38.400 --> 09:43.000
Do you know any actresses?
What's in the theater this winter?

09:43.560 --> 09:44.840
Put it there.

09:44.920 --> 09:49.640
They are a gallant lot, it's said.
I've read some are free with their charms.

09:50.200 --> 09:51.440
Do tell me.

09:55.960 --> 09:58.360
Here, to satisfy your curiosity.

09:58.440 --> 10:03.040
The Mercure de France!
We only get the Courrier d'Avignon.

10:03.480 --> 10:06.200
- I'll show you the common room.
- He'll stay here.

10:06.320 --> 10:08.640
Very well. Good night, sir.

10:14.440 --> 10:17.200
It's not Versailles, but the wine's good.

11:16.280 --> 11:17.880
It's big as a cow.

11:21.560 --> 11:25.840
Jacques says he's seen many wolves.
It's no wolf.

11:25.920 --> 11:28.960
Its snout is longer,
its teeth are like knives.

11:36.480 --> 11:40.960
- If not a wolf, what was it then?
- A demon.

11:41.320 --> 11:45.240
Chevalier, the Beast has struck
near St. Alban.

12:06.760 --> 12:07.680
There.

12:08.800 --> 12:10.800
There's no one there.

12:10.880 --> 12:11.840
Halt!

12:13.240 --> 12:16.120
What are those bastards doing here?

12:16.400 --> 12:17.760
Good day, Captain.

12:18.880 --> 12:22.520
Good day, Marquis. My respects.

12:23.040 --> 12:25.320
Beware. There are traps.

12:26.160 --> 12:30.280
Duhamel, Sir Grégoire de Fronsac
of the King's Gardens.

12:31.040 --> 12:35.800
He'd like to examine her body,
with your permission, of course.

12:36.760 --> 12:39.560
The one who brutalized my men?

12:39.880 --> 12:43.360
- Had I known you ordered...
- I did not.

12:44.200 --> 12:47.200
You did well, and I beg your pardon.

12:47.760 --> 12:51.280
They're soldiers trained for war,
not hunting.

12:52.440 --> 12:55.400
Careful, she's stuffed with poison.

13:04.960 --> 13:07.120
What sort of gardener are you?

13:07.240 --> 13:12.000
When the Beast is killed,
His Majesty wants it studied in Paris.

13:12.400 --> 13:15.760
I'll keep it after it's captured.

13:16.120 --> 13:17.760
I'm having a look.

13:20.720 --> 13:24.360
With that jaw,
it must weigh 500 pounds.

13:24.960 --> 13:26.840
This time, I'll get it...

13:27.400 --> 13:29.240
before the snow.

13:29.560 --> 13:31.800
It can't get away.

13:31.920 --> 13:33.960
- Ever seen it?
- Once.

13:34.480 --> 13:38.400
Once, in my musket sight.
I wounded it, my word on it.

13:38.480 --> 13:41.120
It collapsed, then at once revived.

13:41.240 --> 13:45.200
We lost it near Mt. Mouchet,
vanished in the wood.

13:46.080 --> 13:47.880
Did it look like this?

13:50.560 --> 13:54.480
It had a black stripe
and spike on its back.

14:08.920 --> 14:13.680
My friends, this is the sketch artist,

14:14.200 --> 14:16.480
Sir Grégoire de Fronsac.

14:17.040 --> 14:20.040
A man of Providence indeed,
come from Paris to...

14:20.160 --> 14:21.280
sketch the Beast.

14:21.800 --> 14:24.880
His Eminence, the Bishop de Mende,

14:25.120 --> 14:26.960
the Duke de Moncan,

14:27.080 --> 14:29.440
the Count de Morangias,

14:30.080 --> 14:32.000
and Madame the Countess.

14:32.320 --> 14:36.640
Their son, Jean-François,
who has also traveled.

14:38.720 --> 14:42.040
- A clever hand, sir.
- Thank you, sir.

14:46.200 --> 14:48.960
M. Laffont, our intendant.

14:49.640 --> 14:52.880
Father Henri Sardis of St. Alban's.

14:57.360 --> 15:01.320
Tell us, sir, is there talk
of the Beast in Paris?

15:01.960 --> 15:05.560
- They've written ballads.
- Prayers would do better!

15:05.640 --> 15:08.280
Does Capt. Duhamel so need God?

15:08.520 --> 15:09.720
Don't we all?

15:10.480 --> 15:13.720
Duhamel just dresses his men as women

15:13.840 --> 15:15.720
to bait the Beast.

15:16.120 --> 15:18.200
He's doing what he can.

15:18.320 --> 15:19.880
Such indulgence!

15:20.520 --> 15:22.520
Duhamel is incompetent.

15:22.640 --> 15:26.160
His hunts exhaust the people,
his ruffians devastate our land,

15:26.240 --> 15:28.400
and the Beast roams free.

15:28.480 --> 15:32.800
If Duhamel is all I get
for paying my taxes to Paris,

15:33.280 --> 15:35.720
I'd rather give it to my valets.

15:36.080 --> 15:39.840
- What do you say, sir?
- You're not obliged to reply.

15:39.960 --> 15:43.360
His Lordship likes to argue,
but he's a good Christian.

15:43.440 --> 15:47.280
When you arrived,
this assembly was talking my ears off

15:47.400 --> 15:49.400
with God this and God that.

15:49.480 --> 15:52.880
It's said the Pope sent a spy to see

15:53.000 --> 15:56.560
if the Beast is
a manifestation of the Devil.

16:19.960 --> 16:21.120
Pardon me.

16:29.000 --> 16:33.400
Marianne de Morangias.
A daunting task indeed.

16:33.680 --> 16:35.760
The most elusive quarry in our land.

16:36.080 --> 16:40.080
- Who's the hapless hunter?
- Des Forêts, a playwright.

16:40.920 --> 16:44.800
- Then it's simple.
- Careful, she's a Morangias.

16:49.280 --> 16:51.240
Sir, we were conferring...

16:51.360 --> 16:53.320
- M. Des Forêts?
- Himself.

16:53.440 --> 16:56.680
An honor. Good writers are rare.

16:56.800 --> 16:58.560
Marquis d'Apcher spoke of you.

16:59.120 --> 17:01.720
He thought of you for his memoirs.

17:01.800 --> 17:02.720
Really?

17:02.800 --> 17:05.920
He's in good spirits.
But have some finesse.

17:06.040 --> 17:09.760
Wait till he broaches the subject.

17:10.640 --> 17:11.839
Excuse me.

17:13.640 --> 17:16.440
- Have you no shame?
- None.

17:17.520 --> 17:20.520
Does the naturalist like our country?

17:20.599 --> 17:24.880
I've only glimpsed its beauties so far,
or one of them.

17:26.119 --> 17:28.359
Is such the talk of court?

17:29.040 --> 17:32.640
No, this is a couplet
reserved for provincials.

17:33.480 --> 17:37.320
I might go to court
if there were ladies like you.

17:38.840 --> 17:41.760
Dinner is served. Let's go in.

17:42.240 --> 17:43.960
Whither thou goest...

17:46.680 --> 17:50.920
In sailing up the St. Lawrence
we found in our nets

17:51.080 --> 17:54.120
the strangest animal I'd ever seen.

17:54.680 --> 17:56.920
I'd heard of the native's sacred fish,

17:57.040 --> 17:59.880
but I was sure it was a legend.

18:00.800 --> 18:03.000
I was looking at a fish

18:03.120 --> 18:06.280
the shape and size of a trout,

18:07.040 --> 18:11.800
but which was entirely covered
in a rich black fur.

18:13.280 --> 18:15.960
A furry trout? Surely you jest.

18:16.040 --> 18:17.080
No, sir.

18:30.000 --> 18:33.160
Salmo truta dermopilla from Canada.

18:34.200 --> 18:35.760
Soft as mink.

18:41.560 --> 18:45.720
- Nature is extraordinary!
- The water must be cold!

18:46.040 --> 18:49.040
This proves the impossible
may be possible.

18:49.120 --> 18:50.080
Well said.

18:50.280 --> 18:53.440
It surely won you the King's favor.

18:53.520 --> 18:55.600
I doubt he deserves it.

18:56.000 --> 18:59.280
Though I do recognize
your comedic talent.

18:59.720 --> 19:02.080
Had I two hands, I'd applaud.

19:04.600 --> 19:08.320
- Please pardon him.
- Your son is right.

19:09.160 --> 19:11.400
This animal doesn't exist.

19:11.920 --> 19:14.600
My taxidermist is a clever man.

19:15.080 --> 19:16.880
Please excuse the prank.

19:17.240 --> 19:21.080
Should this fable convince us
there is no Beast?

19:21.200 --> 19:23.160
That we're simpletons?

19:23.320 --> 19:25.280
The moral of the fable

19:25.400 --> 19:28.600
is that dragons and unicorns
only appear in fables.

19:28.960 --> 19:32.200
Lies appear true when dressed in Latin.

19:32.320 --> 19:36.000
Careful, sir. We may lose
all sense of what you're saying.

19:36.440 --> 19:39.760
Indeed, are you a naturalist
or a philosopher?

19:39.880 --> 19:41.720
Or worse, an actor!

19:41.800 --> 19:44.800
I believe the knight is,
above all, Parisian.

19:44.920 --> 19:48.440
Enough talk of the Beast.
After all, it only preys on peasants.

19:48.520 --> 19:51.440
How about a guessing game? Charades?

19:51.560 --> 19:56.120
I've just composed a lover's lament.
May I, Countess?

19:56.360 --> 19:59.160
- If it isn't licentious.
- Oh no.

19:59.360 --> 20:01.600
It's very chaste and pure.

20:01.720 --> 20:04.200
It's an improvisation.

20:04.280 --> 20:07.200
It's called "Wolves Howl".

20:13.040 --> 20:17.360
"I went not warily
though I bore no malice, verily

20:17.920 --> 20:21.400
"Your sly eye caught my heart
in its prowl

20:21.760 --> 20:25.240
"I howl"

20:39.200 --> 20:41.000
Shall I see you soon?

20:41.080 --> 20:43.480
Have you other amazing animals to show me?

20:43.560 --> 20:48.280
You seem set in your idea of me.
Allow me to change your mind.

20:48.360 --> 20:49.560
Try.

20:50.560 --> 20:53.280
- Coming to the hunt?
- Certainly.

20:53.760 --> 20:57.000
I can't allow it. Too dangerous.

20:57.960 --> 21:01.080
Obedience is the virtue
of well-born girls.

21:01.160 --> 21:03.360
This young man is right.

21:07.960 --> 21:10.040
<i>That day in Gévaudan,</i>

21:10.400 --> 21:13.440
<i>there was the greatest hunt
ever in France.</i>

21:14.440 --> 21:18.280
<i>The King offered 6,000 pounds bounty
for the Beast.</i>

21:18.360 --> 21:21.480
<i>Thousands of enlisted peasants,
swordsmen and soldiers</i>

21:21.560 --> 21:25.120
<i>were joined by every hunter
and adventurer in the region.</i>

21:25.760 --> 21:30.360
<i>For a few hours,
we forgot we were the hunted.</i>

22:29.720 --> 22:33.840
You each have a map and a location.
Movements begin at 7:00.

22:33.960 --> 22:34.880
Thank you.

22:34.960 --> 22:38.440
You might well thank us!
My people have better things to do.

22:38.520 --> 22:41.200
Your generosity rivals your courage.

22:41.280 --> 22:44.680
Enough! For your sake,
we'd better take it.

22:44.760 --> 22:47.280
We shall, Your Lordship.

22:49.640 --> 22:51.440
What is this ruckus?

25:59.320 --> 26:01.160
Fine weapon, isn't it?

26:01.240 --> 26:04.280
I had it made in Mende after a campaign.

26:04.400 --> 26:06.960
Custom-made for me, of course.

26:09.600 --> 26:13.640
Look. Even in Paris
you'll never see such a bullet.

26:13.760 --> 26:15.360
I make them myself.

26:15.520 --> 26:17.880
Silver? Afraid of werewolves?

26:19.920 --> 26:22.320
I like to sign my shots.

26:22.760 --> 26:26.680
I'm a hunter, Fronsac.
And it has cost me dearly.

26:27.040 --> 26:28.640
How did it happen?

26:29.040 --> 26:33.440
I learned the hard way
that one bullet won't always suffice.

26:33.520 --> 26:38.240
And, Sardis notwithstanding,
prayer won't cure gangrene.

26:38.640 --> 26:41.520
- Did a bear injure you?
- A lion.

26:42.920 --> 26:46.160
Yes, two years in the Navy,
I traveled a lot.

26:46.240 --> 26:48.120
Do you know Africa?

26:48.960 --> 26:51.800
My lords, my daughter caused all this.

26:51.880 --> 26:54.400
Here. Punish her as you will.

26:58.000 --> 26:59.480
Witch!

27:00.440 --> 27:02.640
She's a daughter of the Devil!

27:02.960 --> 27:06.680
- A demon has got her!
- She's ill!

27:07.000 --> 27:10.960
She's not possessed!

27:16.400 --> 27:17.800
Burn her!

27:21.840 --> 27:24.760
She mustn't swallow her tongue.
She'd suffocate.

27:26.040 --> 27:30.040
- She's not possessed.
- I know.

27:39.400 --> 27:43.240
Naturalist, philosopher
and a bonesetter as well?

27:53.560 --> 27:56.080
She didn't show. I won the bet.

28:05.080 --> 28:06.240
Marquis.

28:17.720 --> 28:19.320
And the natives?

28:21.280 --> 28:24.080
Superstitious brutes, like here.

28:25.560 --> 28:29.920
Indian hunters eat the hearts
of their prey for strength.

28:30.000 --> 28:31.880
Are they brutes then?

28:31.960 --> 28:35.120
In Africa, it's their enemies' hearts.

28:35.480 --> 28:39.920
My lord the Count, Jean-François,
you must move east...

28:41.080 --> 28:42.400
There you are.

28:42.560 --> 28:45.200
Your mother will be worried.

28:45.520 --> 28:49.680
She always is.
If I listened, I'd be in a convent.

28:50.040 --> 28:53.040
I knew you didn't believe me.
You're a libertine.

28:53.120 --> 28:56.400
- Not when I'm in love.
- You're in love?

29:01.120 --> 29:04.160
Ridiculous! We've hardly met.

29:05.000 --> 29:07.040
You thought I meant you?

29:14.160 --> 29:17.120
She must learn to ride like a lady.

29:18.040 --> 29:20.520
No harm in a little exercise.

29:23.120 --> 29:27.080
- My father sees no evil.
- My son sees evil everywhere.

30:20.800 --> 30:22.880
People died here.

30:23.880 --> 30:25.360
How do you know?

30:27.080 --> 30:28.480
I hear their cries.

30:28.840 --> 30:30.520
Mani, stop it.

30:30.680 --> 30:34.320
He's right. This was a Templar stronghold.

30:35.080 --> 30:38.280
Twenty-five heretics
were burned alive in the chapel.

30:39.520 --> 30:43.120
- Is he a seer?
- No need to be.

30:47.400 --> 30:49.160
You just need to look.

30:58.840 --> 31:01.240
My brother and I played here.

31:01.800 --> 31:03.480
Were you not afraid?

31:05.000 --> 31:07.280
He said he would protect me from ghosts.

32:16.800 --> 32:20.720
- No taste for the hunt?
- That a crime here?

32:23.160 --> 32:26.320
The Indians say
a portrait steals the soul.

32:27.040 --> 32:29.080
My soul interests you as well?

33:10.280 --> 33:12.360
On foot at a hunt?

33:12.480 --> 33:15.480
- My fault.
- I didn't ask you.

33:17.920 --> 33:21.160
- What possessed you?
- It's only a wolf.

33:21.400 --> 33:24.880
- And if it were the Beast?
- I don't think so.

33:29.120 --> 33:30.320
Thank you.

33:37.320 --> 33:40.400
Pray the Beast is one of these wolves.

33:40.480 --> 33:43.200
These won't devour anyone now.

33:44.800 --> 33:46.240
Curious fellow.

33:46.760 --> 33:49.320
- Where did you find him?
- New France.

33:50.640 --> 33:52.880
Is he an Acadian?

33:53.320 --> 33:56.200
An Indian. A Mohawk Iroquois.

33:56.480 --> 34:00.840
An Indian? A real one?
He doesn't look it.

34:01.320 --> 34:06.160
Come to St. Alban tonight.
We'll have fun with your valet.

34:06.240 --> 34:07.920
He's not my valet.

34:08.000 --> 34:10.639
- What then?
- He's my brother.

34:32.360 --> 34:36.880
Really! Mixing your blood
with that of a savage?

34:38.120 --> 34:40.840
A man who shares one's hardship
is no savage.

34:41.400 --> 34:44.400
Mani saved me from the English
at Trois Riviéres.

34:44.679 --> 34:47.320
I thought the savages were cannibals.

34:47.520 --> 34:51.520
As you can see, sir, Mani is no animal.

34:55.320 --> 34:58.920
Can you reproduce
with a woman of our race?

35:01.800 --> 35:05.880
All women are the same color
when candles blow out.

35:06.480 --> 35:08.840
Yes, Father, they even have wit.

35:09.120 --> 35:11.720
Indians and whites have had children.

35:11.840 --> 35:13.960
We're one species.

35:14.080 --> 35:17.680
Don't speak too soon.
It's a bit like the Negroes.

35:18.960 --> 35:20.720
What say you, Sardis?

35:21.080 --> 35:23.880
Your blood brother is God's child.

35:24.240 --> 35:26.600
- Has he been baptized?
- He hasn't asked.

35:26.680 --> 35:28.800
You are a man of your times!

35:28.920 --> 35:30.800
Mani has his beliefs.

35:30.920 --> 35:34.800
At home, he was a sort of priest.

35:35.400 --> 35:38.560
If they have priests, they're doomed.

35:38.680 --> 35:40.360
What are these beliefs?

35:40.480 --> 35:44.320
Each man has an animal spirit,
called a totem.

35:44.920 --> 35:46.600
Amusing. How does it work?

35:49.840 --> 35:51.120
Would you?

36:00.240 --> 36:02.480
Never fear, it won't hurt.

36:11.920 --> 36:14.960
Caribou. A sort of stag.

36:16.640 --> 36:18.360
What says my wife?

36:18.480 --> 36:22.600
Am I a stag because of my horns
or because of something else?

36:23.320 --> 36:27.200
And my dear Thomas, what's his totem?

36:27.400 --> 36:29.520
Worm. Bookworm probably.

36:38.280 --> 36:39.240
Snake.

36:40.400 --> 36:42.840
For Indians, the snake embodies wisdom.

36:42.960 --> 36:44.320
Serpent wise.

36:44.600 --> 36:46.200
And our intendant?

36:50.360 --> 36:51.320
Boar.

36:53.200 --> 36:54.600
Lighten your spirit.

36:55.000 --> 36:58.920
Perhaps for these barbarians
the pig is nobility.

36:59.680 --> 37:01.400
Who's next? Sardis?

37:06.760 --> 37:07.920
And me?

37:09.000 --> 37:11.680
What am I, a semi-lion?

37:12.440 --> 37:13.920
Half an eagle?

37:15.240 --> 37:18.680
Make me a lizard,
so my arm may grow back.

37:18.840 --> 37:20.720
Jean-François, enough.

37:23.600 --> 37:26.000
What? Have I been gauche?

37:27.520 --> 37:30.160
Let me be.

37:31.000 --> 37:33.320
Mademoiselle? Your turn?

37:34.920 --> 37:38.000
Pardon me,
but I'm weary of your tricks.

37:38.080 --> 37:42.160
I'll retire before you begin
juggling or dancing on a ball.

37:42.280 --> 37:43.640
Good night.

38:03.240 --> 38:05.200
It'll cheer you, Fronsac.

38:05.280 --> 38:10.000
It's the best house in Mende.
You'll sleep better than at an inn.

38:22.840 --> 38:26.600
They're all for you.
And the new girl is very...

38:28.840 --> 38:30.600
Dear little Marquis.

38:30.960 --> 38:32.160
Come.

39:15.280 --> 39:18.240
I'm expensive, Grégoire de Fronsac.

39:18.640 --> 39:23.160
- Do you know me?
- In here, Gévaudan becomes very small.

39:24.040 --> 39:25.280
Italian?

39:26.920 --> 39:28.800
Just passing through.

39:30.920 --> 39:32.440
I have money.

39:33.080 --> 39:36.520
It's not only a matter of money.

39:44.320 --> 39:45.800
What then?

40:07.800 --> 40:12.560
- Who did that to you?
- An Iroquois arrow.

40:13.640 --> 40:15.600
Not far from the heart.

40:16.440 --> 40:19.920
I may be a lucky man.

40:22.080 --> 40:23.400
And that?

40:25.600 --> 40:26.720
A bear.

40:28.400 --> 40:30.840
He didn't care much for me.

40:39.000 --> 40:41.520
You haven't seen anything yet.

40:55.200 --> 40:57.440
My business is dangerous.

40:58.760 --> 41:00.760
Some men aren't so nice.

41:05.720 --> 41:08.240
Something to remember me by.

41:12.600 --> 41:15.040
A scandal! In my house!

41:16.680 --> 41:19.480
- Valentine!
- I don't lay with sorcerers!

41:19.600 --> 41:22.360
- What?
- Snakes on him! I saw them move!

41:22.440 --> 41:24.760
Our reputation! You have to go!

41:24.880 --> 41:28.200
It's nothing.
He's an Indian, not a sorcerer.

41:28.320 --> 41:31.480
- Then no Indians!
- You have delicate whores.

41:32.200 --> 41:35.600
Come on, girls.
Who will go with our redskin?

41:36.160 --> 41:38.320
I'll double the fee.

41:38.640 --> 41:42.520
- I like his tattoos.
- That settles that.

41:43.400 --> 41:46.480
So, a sorcerer are we?

42:33.920 --> 42:35.760
Will you do my portrait?

42:36.400 --> 42:38.160
If you don't behave.

42:55.640 --> 43:00.120
<i>Weeks passed, and Duhamel's men
couldn't find the Beast.</i>

43:01.440 --> 43:04.840
<i>A third winter would be spent
under its reign.</i>

43:05.320 --> 43:10.080
<i>The snow could not stop it
anymore than our rifles and dogs.</i>

43:15.040 --> 43:19.280
Recall how God warned us
through the words of Moses:

43:20.680 --> 43:24.760
"I shall come unto you like a bear
whose cubs are ravished.

43:26.600 --> 43:31.000
"As a lion I shall devour your children
and spill their entrails.

43:32.280 --> 43:34.920
"I will set upon ye a fearsome Beast

43:35.000 --> 43:37.880
"to consume you and your flocks,

43:38.000 --> 43:40.560
"and make your fields barren."

43:49.000 --> 43:53.320
How long, O Lord, wouldst Thou forsake us?

44:15.840 --> 44:20.600
A candle for each victim.
Is this truly the Age of Reason?

44:33.960 --> 44:35.520
Have mercy!

44:37.680 --> 44:38.960
Forgive me!

44:39.920 --> 44:41.120
Have mercy!

44:42.920 --> 44:44.280
Bless me!

44:48.360 --> 44:50.000
What is it, my son?

44:50.080 --> 44:53.520
God has punished me!
My children vanished on Mt. Mouchet!

44:53.720 --> 44:56.560
I'm damned! We all are!

44:59.360 --> 45:02.120
Gather your men. We must leave.

45:08.000 --> 45:10.160
Alert Mani. I'll find you on the way!

45:18.240 --> 45:20.120
Hello, friend of the wolves.

45:20.320 --> 45:22.440
I have something for you.

45:28.360 --> 45:31.520
I want to see you. Alone.

45:34.520 --> 45:38.800
In 10 days my mother's going to a retreat
and my father to a cure.

45:38.880 --> 45:42.200
- Ten days?
- I'm not as free as you.

47:03.600 --> 47:04.800
The torch.

47:05.960 --> 47:07.400
Bring the torch!

47:12.120 --> 47:14.640
The storm is rising; the men are tired.

47:14.920 --> 47:16.240
We'd best go home.

47:17.040 --> 47:19.280
No. We must find the girl.

47:58.720 --> 48:00.360
I found the child.

48:18.360 --> 48:23.120
Captain, your web of traps
snares more peasants than wolves,

48:23.880 --> 48:27.080
your men have plundered the population,

48:27.720 --> 48:31.880
and since you began,
the wolf has taken 12 more lives.

48:32.240 --> 48:35.120
It should never have escaped us.

48:35.240 --> 48:36.360
How's that?

48:36.440 --> 48:39.240
It should never have escaped us.

48:39.360 --> 48:41.000
What say you, Fronsac?

48:41.600 --> 48:44.200
What sort of wolf is this?

48:49.280 --> 48:52.920
My only certainty is that this is no wolf.

48:53.720 --> 48:58.480
Wolves don't attack men, or very rarely.
I studied them in New France.

48:58.600 --> 49:01.440
Perhaps our wolves are different.

49:01.520 --> 49:03.560
A rabid wolf will attack.

49:04.080 --> 49:06.560
And dies within a fortnight.

49:06.640 --> 49:09.440
For two years,
the Beast has had its bloody reign.

49:10.000 --> 49:13.400
Its victims bear wounds
no wolf could inflict.

49:14.840 --> 49:18.120
I've often found upon the body

49:18.200 --> 49:20.200
a piece of this metal.

49:20.640 --> 49:23.080
- So?
- So...

49:25.400 --> 49:28.080
no animal has fangs of iron.

49:32.120 --> 49:35.000
Then the Beast is not an animal? Fine.

49:35.920 --> 49:37.320
How do we catch it?

49:37.440 --> 49:40.080
While we speculate,
it's killing our people.

49:40.520 --> 49:44.880
Gentlemen, let us hear M. de Fronsac
with utmost attention.

49:46.480 --> 49:48.560
So you say, sir,

49:48.680 --> 49:51.480
this is no ordinary animal.

49:52.240 --> 49:53.680
We all think so.

49:54.040 --> 49:57.120
And for myself I'm pleased you concede

49:57.200 --> 50:00.040
this is something supernatural.

50:00.120 --> 50:03.840
I concede nothing, Father.
I have only doubts.

50:04.560 --> 50:06.680
Anything to add?

50:07.920 --> 50:09.240
No, gentlemen.

50:11.040 --> 50:13.760
I've received this from Paris.

50:14.880 --> 50:19.640
Capt. Duhamel His Majesty has been
informed of your ineffective efforts.

50:20.640 --> 50:23.640
He requests you be
relieved of your duties.

50:24.000 --> 50:27.920
You and your men
are to return to Langogne at once.

50:28.600 --> 50:31.720
Sir Beauterne, Master at Arms,
is on his way.

50:31.840 --> 50:35.240
His mandate is to kill
this ferocious wolf.

50:36.560 --> 50:40.400
He alone is authorized to hunt
in the diocese.

50:41.840 --> 50:43.120
Gentlemen.

50:55.120 --> 50:56.840
Then I'm forgiven?

50:57.280 --> 51:00.920
I was curious to know my "totem".
Is that the word?

51:01.040 --> 51:02.520
I would guess...

51:03.840 --> 51:05.040
mermaid.

51:05.600 --> 51:09.120
Are you never serious?
I'll ask your redskin.

51:10.360 --> 51:13.120
And the Beast? Have you spotted it?

51:14.360 --> 51:15.760
Forbidden subject?

51:15.920 --> 51:20.160
My absurd assumptions would
get me laughed out of King's Garden.

51:20.800 --> 51:24.640
If I said the Beast
is flesh and iron mixed,

51:25.080 --> 51:29.280
that it's possessed of reason
and may disappear at will,

51:29.400 --> 51:30.640
what would you say?

51:30.760 --> 51:33.480
Country air has affected your mind.

51:33.560 --> 51:35.160
It's eluding me.

51:35.520 --> 51:39.200
After three months,
you expect to have finished?

51:39.320 --> 51:44.080
Should the Beast have surrendered?
Perhaps it's afraid of you.

51:44.640 --> 51:46.240
Am I so fearsome?

51:46.360 --> 51:49.520
A hard-won victory will be better savored.

51:51.920 --> 51:54.720
Is it true you're going to Africa?

51:55.040 --> 51:58.560
For now it's but
a naturalist's winter dream.

51:58.640 --> 52:01.800
And you? Ever yearn for new horizons?

52:03.600 --> 52:06.880
A lady has more duties than yearnings.

52:06.960 --> 52:09.480
Do you see Sardis over there?

52:10.360 --> 52:11.880
Are you being watched?

52:13.240 --> 52:14.880
He's there to protect me.

52:15.000 --> 52:18.520
Alone with you,
God knows what could happen.

52:19.000 --> 52:22.840
Let's go inside.
Our priest might catch cold.

52:33.200 --> 52:34.720
Good evening, sir.

52:46.760 --> 52:49.680
- You're in love.
- I don't know.

52:50.160 --> 52:51.600
I do.

52:52.120 --> 52:53.360
The cards?

52:53.800 --> 52:56.480
I've never needed them for you.

52:58.000 --> 52:59.920
So let's drink.

53:01.640 --> 53:04.160
To Mademoiselle de Morangias.

53:05.440 --> 53:08.680
- What?
- Her brother was here.

53:09.800 --> 53:11.600
You slept with him?

53:13.400 --> 53:16.200
Him? He can't stand to be touched.

53:17.640 --> 53:20.120
He watches, he drinks,

53:20.520 --> 53:24.200
then he talks in his sleep, like all men.

53:25.240 --> 53:26.680
Do I?

53:28.240 --> 53:29.760
What do I say?

53:30.600 --> 53:32.080
"Again!"

53:38.480 --> 53:42.520
Know how Florentine women
keep their husbands home?

53:45.520 --> 53:48.160
Each morning, they give them

53:48.360 --> 53:50.760
a slow poison,

53:51.320 --> 53:53.440
and every evening the antidote.

53:53.520 --> 53:56.840
That way, when the husband sleeps away

53:56.960 --> 53:59.040
he has a very bad night.

54:00.800 --> 54:03.040
You needn't resort to that.

54:07.360 --> 54:09.960
Anyway, we aren't married.

55:32.600 --> 55:36.880
Make way for Antoine de Beauterne,
Royal Master at Arms,

55:37.000 --> 55:40.440
who has come to rid the country
of the Beast!

55:59.920 --> 56:03.880
- I am Grégoire de Fronsac.
- Yes, Buffon's envoy.

56:04.000 --> 56:05.760
The naturalist embalmer.

56:05.880 --> 56:09.800
M. de Beauterne is at the Intendant's.
Come at 2:00.

56:48.080 --> 56:51.920
His Majesty asked my advice
about your report.

56:52.960 --> 56:55.200
Complicated fables indeed!

56:56.440 --> 56:59.480
I believe the Beast is a wolf.

57:02.520 --> 57:05.400
I shall go out for it tomorrow.

57:05.520 --> 57:08.280
I would rather you didn't come.

57:11.520 --> 57:12.800
Why is that?

57:14.240 --> 57:18.760
The King left this affair to me,
and to my sole discretion.

57:19.560 --> 57:22.280
I have no need of you to end it.

57:26.560 --> 57:31.280
On the table there's a letter
from Buffon and our beloved king.

57:33.080 --> 57:36.800
I'm at his service,
but believe me this is not...

57:36.920 --> 57:41.200
I've read your report. Trouble yourself
no longer with this Beast.

57:41.320 --> 57:42.840
It's my affair.

57:44.880 --> 57:46.120
You may go.

57:51.640 --> 57:53.160
Come here.

59:05.160 --> 59:08.880
<i>A woman from Lorciére.
It attacked her coming from the fair.</i>

59:09.000 --> 59:12.680
<i>We lost it near Mt. Mouchet,
vanished in the wood.</i>

59:12.960 --> 59:15.520
<i>The Beast has struck near St. Alban.</i>

59:15.600 --> 59:20.360
<i>God has punished me!
My children vanished on Mt. Mouchet!</i>

59:27.920 --> 59:30.080
<i>I don't believe anymore than you in...</i>

59:30.160 --> 59:33.520
<i>Its snout is longer,
its teeth are like knives.</i>

59:34.200 --> 59:36.840
<i>My only certainty is that this is no wolf.</i>

59:36.920 --> 59:39.880
<i>- The Beast is no animal.
- A rabid wolf will attack.</i>

59:40.000 --> 59:41.720
<i>How do we catch it?</i>

59:42.480 --> 59:44.480
<i>No animal has iron fangs.</i>

59:44.840 --> 59:46.840
Sir, come at once!

59:49.440 --> 59:50.840
I saw him!

59:51.720 --> 59:56.120
He was dispensing poison
and saying satanic incantations!

59:56.920 --> 59:59.200
God only knows for how long!

01:00:10.520 --> 01:00:11.760
Let him go.

01:00:13.880 --> 01:00:15.760
An Indian remedy, Father.

01:00:15.840 --> 01:00:18.360
Only our prayers may save her.

01:00:19.600 --> 01:00:21.440
But she was...

01:00:22.080 --> 01:00:23.320
A miracle!

01:00:23.840 --> 01:00:26.520
What happened to your brother?

01:01:14.120 --> 01:01:18.400
- A man with the Beast?
- The child is incoherent.

01:01:38.520 --> 01:01:40.440
Yes, the Beast is dead.

01:01:40.760 --> 01:01:42.960
No cure for 10 shots in the gut.

01:01:49.440 --> 01:01:52.840
We've brought your things. Begin at once.

01:02:01.200 --> 01:02:03.840
- It's not the Beast.
- Get to work!

01:02:03.920 --> 01:02:07.200
- Ridiculous!
- M. de Beauterne is coming.

01:02:07.280 --> 01:02:08.840
Watch your lip!

01:02:08.920 --> 01:02:10.960
Hello. Leave us!

01:02:12.120 --> 01:02:14.520
Don't you like my Beast?

01:02:14.880 --> 01:02:18.840
What is this? You know it's not the Beast.

01:02:18.920 --> 01:02:21.280
Its jaw is twice as large.

01:02:21.400 --> 01:02:23.600
You can fix that here.

01:02:23.800 --> 01:02:24.720
What?

01:02:24.800 --> 01:02:29.480
Paris awaits. I have only this wolf.
So make me a Beast.

01:02:30.200 --> 01:02:33.000
- To fool the King?
- No, Fronsac.

01:02:33.720 --> 01:02:38.200
I carry out his will.
You'd be wise to do the same.

01:02:39.880 --> 01:02:41.840
Is that a threat, sir?

01:02:41.960 --> 01:02:44.840
At my age? Come now, you know me.

01:02:44.920 --> 01:02:47.760
You're too smart for threats.

01:02:48.080 --> 01:02:51.320
Do your duty, the King will be grateful.

01:02:51.440 --> 01:02:54.320
Otherwise, he'll be quite upset.

01:02:54.680 --> 01:02:57.960
You have what you need.
I'm counting on you.

01:02:58.040 --> 01:02:59.840
Good-bye for now.

01:05:34.920 --> 01:05:37.880
Good evening, my unhappy friend.

01:05:41.200 --> 01:05:44.160
Are you sad to be returning to Paris?

01:05:44.240 --> 01:05:47.480
The Beast is dead. You should be happy.

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:50.880
Do you want me to tell you a secret?

01:05:50.960 --> 01:05:52.640
I collect them.

01:05:54.520 --> 01:05:58.680
Beauterne killed a simple wolf.
He is an impostor.

01:05:58.800 --> 01:06:00.960
And I am his accomplice.

01:06:02.720 --> 01:06:06.320
Come, let's drink to our betrayals.

01:06:42.520 --> 01:06:44.200
You saw nothing.

01:07:04.280 --> 01:07:07.040
You are no longer welcome
at the castle, sir!

01:07:07.360 --> 01:07:10.560
Tell Mademoiselle de Morangias
that I am here!

01:07:10.680 --> 01:07:13.480
- I've already told you...
- Speak of the devil!

01:07:13.600 --> 01:07:17.120
My son and I were just
talking about you, sir.

01:07:17.200 --> 01:07:19.680
It is your daughter I have come to visit.

01:07:19.760 --> 01:07:22.440
- I'm afraid that is impossible.
- I insist.

01:07:22.520 --> 01:07:24.640
Let him come in, Mother.

01:07:28.120 --> 01:07:31.800
Be careful, Jean-François,
you know how these matters end.

01:07:31.920 --> 01:07:33.040
Leave us.

01:07:36.160 --> 01:07:39.000
Sir, Marianne is suffering.

01:07:41.560 --> 01:07:43.120
I don't understand.

01:07:46.520 --> 01:07:51.200
However, Fronsac,
you are not a stranger to what ails her.

01:07:51.640 --> 01:07:52.640
Where is she?

01:07:55.800 --> 01:07:57.080
Follow me.

01:08:00.280 --> 01:08:02.400
So kind of you to visit.

01:08:02.960 --> 01:08:05.320
Mademoiselle, what ails you?

01:08:05.400 --> 01:08:08.200
I am to return to Paris,
but that depends on you.

01:08:08.280 --> 01:08:10.040
Have a safe journey.

01:08:14.240 --> 01:08:16.200
I warned you, Fronsac.

01:08:17.560 --> 01:08:19.840
You have offered me only one present,

01:08:19.960 --> 01:08:23.640
and here I give you two
for your collection.

01:08:26.520 --> 01:08:29.840
I've been warned about men of your kind.

01:08:30.479 --> 01:08:32.240
Men of my kind, mademoiselle,

01:08:32.319 --> 01:08:35.640
never condemn people
without having listened to them.

01:08:35.720 --> 01:08:38.840
I don't know how this happened,
but let me explain.

01:08:38.960 --> 01:08:40.640
You needn't bother.

01:08:41.880 --> 01:08:45.680
Please, sir, don't make this
more difficult than it already is.

01:08:47.800 --> 01:08:51.279
Admit that you were not
the man for my sister,

01:08:51.399 --> 01:08:54.040
and leave it at that, no regrets.

01:08:54.479 --> 01:08:59.040
Do you believe that she will remain
your nursemaid all her life?

01:09:02.800 --> 01:09:06.920
Are you not happy
to leave our province in one piece?

01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:10.399
In other times, I would have you flogged
for looking at her.

01:09:11.600 --> 01:09:12.680
Times change.

01:09:13.359 --> 01:09:17.240
Not everywhere, Fronsac.
In any case, not here.

01:09:21.960 --> 01:09:23.080
I'm sorry!

01:09:23.640 --> 01:09:26.840
Will you hit me too
if I tell you to leave?

01:09:27.840 --> 01:09:29.040
Good-bye.

01:09:31.600 --> 01:09:34.000
Have no regrets. He didn't deserve you.

01:09:36.760 --> 01:09:41.120
On this historic day,
thanks be to Sir Grégoire de Fronsac

01:09:41.200 --> 01:09:42.800
of King's Garden.

01:09:42.960 --> 01:09:45.840
The Beast's end is partly his.

01:09:47.279 --> 01:09:50.600
But it is mostly thanks to Your Majesty.

01:09:50.840 --> 01:09:52.399
Let it be known:

01:09:53.479 --> 01:09:57.080
In your sole person
resides sovereign power.

01:10:00.440 --> 01:10:02.840
Only a beast could ignore it.

01:10:02.960 --> 01:10:04.920
That Beast is no more.

01:10:05.400 --> 01:10:08.000
I have only little merit.

01:10:08.640 --> 01:10:12.840
With your power bestowed upon me,
I merely needed to appear,

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:16.000
and the Beast laid down its arms.

01:10:24.040 --> 01:10:25.520
What is this?

01:10:25.640 --> 01:10:29.520
Beauterne's carried out his orders,
as we all should.

01:10:29.640 --> 01:10:31.600
- What orders?
- Mine.

01:10:33.560 --> 01:10:36.120
This is M. Mercier,

01:10:36.560 --> 01:10:40.320
Special Counsel to His Majesty
for domestic matters.

01:10:40.840 --> 01:10:44.320
It was his idea
to send Antoine de Beauterne.

01:10:44.960 --> 01:10:47.960
You're to thank for this prompt victory?

01:10:48.040 --> 01:10:51.240
I admire your scruples,
but it's for the greater good.

01:10:51.960 --> 01:10:53.280
Have you read this?

01:10:54.920 --> 01:10:57.960
It's no longer for sale,
but you may keep it.

01:10:58.520 --> 01:10:59.640
It was banned?

01:10:59.720 --> 01:11:02.240
A fable undermining the King.

01:11:02.440 --> 01:11:06.520
We'd have had trouble if we waited longer.
People are so gullible.

01:11:06.800 --> 01:11:11.240
Better to lie than let lies be spread?

01:11:12.280 --> 01:11:17.040
Truth is a complicated thing.
One must govern with simplicity.

01:11:17.520 --> 01:11:20.160
No more Beast, no more problem.

01:11:20.440 --> 01:11:21.600
It'll go on killing.

01:11:21.720 --> 01:11:25.200
No one will hear of it again.
That's what counts.

01:11:25.280 --> 01:11:29.360
I was forgetting.
His Majesty is most thankful.

01:11:29.440 --> 01:11:32.160
It's said you want to go to Africa.

01:11:32.240 --> 01:11:35.680
In six months,
a schooner sets sail for Senegal.

01:11:36.680 --> 01:11:39.640
If you wish, you'll be aboard.

01:11:41.480 --> 01:11:45.000
Of course, we'll never speak
of Gévaudan again.

01:11:46.520 --> 01:11:48.000
Well, Fronsac?

01:15:06.160 --> 01:15:08.040
Marianne de Morangias?

01:15:08.840 --> 01:15:12.360
Madame, I don't believe I know you.

01:15:14.160 --> 01:15:18.200
We both have a friend in common.

01:15:19.800 --> 01:15:21.400
What are you doing here?

01:15:21.480 --> 01:15:23.720
It's useless to hide behind that veil.

01:15:24.320 --> 01:15:26.560
Your perfume is not that of a Lady.

01:15:29.160 --> 01:15:32.560
Grégoire de Fronsac
has only loved one woman.

01:15:32.680 --> 01:15:35.800
It is your name
he calls out in his sleep.

01:15:36.240 --> 01:15:39.720
He will soon be leaving on a long journey.

01:15:40.760 --> 01:15:42.120
Just perfect.

01:15:43.840 --> 01:15:48.560
When you see Fronsac,
do not tell him anything of our meeting,

01:15:48.880 --> 01:15:51.360
or you will lose him forever.

01:16:03.560 --> 01:16:05.680
Who was that, my child?

01:16:06.760 --> 01:16:07.880
No one.

01:16:33.400 --> 01:16:36.600
That one, in the hold with the others.

01:16:37.440 --> 01:16:41.440
These two, in my cabin.
Be careful, they're fragile!

01:16:41.560 --> 01:16:42.840
Hello, Fronsac!

01:16:43.200 --> 01:16:44.600
Hey, Marquis!

01:16:47.640 --> 01:16:49.120
Good to see you!

01:16:49.880 --> 01:16:51.400
Not as good as all that.

01:16:52.200 --> 01:16:54.920
Two days after you left,
the crimes began again.

01:16:55.040 --> 01:16:58.840
The King no longer sends soldiers.
I can't find volunteers for the hunt.

01:16:58.960 --> 01:17:01.920
I can't do a thing.
I don't know how to catch it.

01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:05.520
Frankly, it wasn't entirely
your talents I was thinking of.

01:17:05.640 --> 01:17:07.520
Mani found the child.

01:17:07.720 --> 01:17:11.120
Just one hunt, Fronsac!
You'll be back within the month.

01:17:11.240 --> 01:17:14.480
Impossible! The King has forbidden us
from returning.

01:17:14.560 --> 01:17:16.960
- The King will not know.
- So you think.

01:17:17.080 --> 01:17:20.520
Is the King's peace of mind
worth all these sacrifices?

01:17:20.640 --> 01:17:22.880
You won't change my mind.

01:17:23.800 --> 01:17:28.240
- Do you want to bet?
- The last time we made a bet, you lost!

01:17:28.880 --> 01:17:31.040
I would have preferred not to use this,

01:17:31.160 --> 01:17:33.800
but, here, it's from Marianne.

01:17:34.320 --> 01:17:35.520
And Mani?

01:17:39.760 --> 01:17:41.160
My friend!

01:17:49.520 --> 01:17:50.720
How are you?

01:17:53.560 --> 01:17:57.600
- We're leaving for the hunt, Mani.
- This time, we'll do it your way.

01:17:58.640 --> 01:18:00.560
So, my friend, any good news?

01:18:01.640 --> 01:18:05.080
Best in the world, Marquis.

01:18:10.800 --> 01:18:13.840
<i>In Gévaudan, the crimes continued,</i>

01:18:14.640 --> 01:18:17.360
<i>but officially, the Beast was dead.</i>

01:18:18.040 --> 01:18:21.920
<i>What really happened
appears in no history book.</i>

01:18:22.600 --> 01:18:24.960
<i>It was carefully kept quiet.</i>

01:18:28.960 --> 01:18:30.920
Is he welcoming us?

01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:32.920
He wants to help us.

01:18:35.840 --> 01:18:39.000
Go to the castle. I'll meet you there.

01:19:07.520 --> 01:19:08.680
What is it?

01:19:16.920 --> 01:19:19.240
Where do Jeanne and Pierre Roulier live?

01:19:19.480 --> 01:19:22.720
Go straight on.
It's the last house in the village.

01:20:23.680 --> 01:20:26.720
This is Jeanne, my nanny.

01:20:29.120 --> 01:20:31.200
Pierre, fetch some wine.

01:20:44.560 --> 01:20:47.480
I'm being watched.
They might know you're back.

01:20:47.560 --> 01:20:50.040
I'll tear you away from your family.

01:21:03.960 --> 01:21:07.320
I can't bear my mother, nor Jean-François.

01:21:07.560 --> 01:21:09.080
I want to leave.

01:21:09.520 --> 01:21:11.680
In a week, we'll go to Paris.

01:21:11.800 --> 01:21:13.040
Why wait?

01:21:13.720 --> 01:21:16.720
The hunt. I promised the Marquis.

01:21:16.800 --> 01:21:18.720
You didn't return for me?

01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:46.160
Look out!

01:21:57.720 --> 01:22:00.680
Leave! Slowly, don't run!

01:22:01.480 --> 01:22:03.160
Over here! Look at me!

01:22:03.240 --> 01:22:05.200
Come here!

01:22:20.840 --> 01:22:21.760
Go, Marianne!

01:23:00.720 --> 01:23:02.680
What is this? Open up!

01:23:06.480 --> 01:23:07.400
My God!

01:23:50.280 --> 01:23:54.040
Tell me, do you really think
we'll find this Beast?

01:23:54.160 --> 01:23:56.080
We're short of men.

01:23:56.200 --> 01:23:59.000
Mani knows what he's doing.
I'm hunting a man.

01:24:02.400 --> 01:24:03.480
A man?

01:24:04.200 --> 01:24:07.720
The Beast is a weapon serving a sick mind.

01:24:08.520 --> 01:24:11.000
- Wouldn't a killer be secretive?
- Right.

01:24:11.160 --> 01:24:13.880
The Beast's first mystery is its fame.

01:24:15.440 --> 01:24:19.160
Its master wants people to talk,
to be afraid and make noise.

01:24:19.240 --> 01:24:20.320
How's that?

01:24:20.840 --> 01:24:22.400
This book is sold all over.

01:24:25.320 --> 01:24:30.040
It says the Beast is punishing
the King's indulgence in philosophers.

01:24:31.120 --> 01:24:32.680
Who wrote it?

01:24:32.760 --> 01:24:35.800
I don't know,
but the Beast has a master. I want him.

01:24:55.720 --> 01:24:58.400
Perhaps your weapon will help...

01:24:58.920 --> 01:25:00.760
but only in your hands!

01:25:01.400 --> 01:25:02.760
And you, Mani?

01:25:03.400 --> 01:25:05.000
Which will you choose?

01:25:05.320 --> 01:25:07.560
Mani doesn't like firearms.

01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:11.800
Too much noise and smoke. Bad smell.

01:25:32.400 --> 01:25:34.920
All will go well, Grandfather.

01:25:36.680 --> 01:25:39.440
Don't worry. We're well prepared.

01:27:47.760 --> 01:27:49.800
Tell me of the Americas.

01:27:53.080 --> 01:27:54.640
Will you never go back?

01:27:56.480 --> 01:27:58.400
Not all my memories are fond ones.

01:27:58.800 --> 01:28:01.480
And Mani? Does he miss his tribe?

01:28:01.960 --> 01:28:03.880
His tribe is no more.

01:28:04.480 --> 01:28:08.680
Before our attack,
the pox had decimated his village.

01:28:08.760 --> 01:28:11.400
Orders were to execute survivors.

01:28:11.520 --> 01:28:14.240
The women, and the children, too.

01:28:14.360 --> 01:28:15.840
Only Mani escaped.

01:28:16.720 --> 01:28:19.840
- How?
- We needed an interpreter.

01:28:20.360 --> 01:28:25.040
I was to teach him our language.
Then I found him slaying the Captain.

01:28:25.520 --> 01:28:27.560
Why didn't you turn him in?

01:28:28.040 --> 01:28:30.320
Know how the Captain waged battle?

01:28:31.040 --> 01:28:34.640
He gave his scouts
infected hospital sheets.

01:28:35.480 --> 01:28:39.760
The Iroquois bought them.
Three weeks later, we'd mop up.

01:28:39.880 --> 01:28:43.760
- And that's our war?
- In any case, that is how we lost.

01:28:47.360 --> 01:28:48.880
Where did he go?

01:28:49.960 --> 01:28:52.640
- To speak to the trees.
- Trees?

01:28:52.920 --> 01:28:54.240
Trees can speak.

01:28:56.400 --> 01:29:00.120
The white man cannot listen or see.

01:29:00.840 --> 01:29:02.160
See what, Mani?

01:29:08.720 --> 01:29:10.120
Want to learn?

01:29:10.560 --> 01:29:13.400
- What's this?
- An Indian sacrament.

01:29:13.840 --> 01:29:16.240
At your own risk, Marquis.

01:29:19.840 --> 01:29:22.720
- What's it do?
- Depends on the person.

01:29:24.760 --> 01:29:27.080
They say they see the invisible.

01:29:28.960 --> 01:29:30.000
So, Mani?

01:29:30.600 --> 01:29:33.960
The Beast is in the forest.
The wolves will help us.

01:29:34.080 --> 01:29:35.320
I see no better.

01:29:35.400 --> 01:29:39.200
This night we shall dance
the dance of blood.

01:29:40.880 --> 01:29:44.640
And the Beast shall come to us
with the sun.

01:29:45.440 --> 01:29:46.880
It has no effect on me.

01:29:52.960 --> 01:29:56.160
<i>That night, Mani invoked spirits</i>

01:29:56.280 --> 01:30:00.280
<i>in a language
even Fronsac couldn't understand.</i>

01:30:00.560 --> 01:30:03.400
<i>And the wolves brought them to the Beast.</i>

01:33:04.880 --> 01:33:08.040
Don't worry, I'll fix this for you.

01:34:29.800 --> 01:34:33.640
Don't worry, girl. I'll see to you.

01:34:34.320 --> 01:34:36.720
I'll take care of you.

01:39:12.560 --> 01:39:16.240
Thomas is asleep. A close call.

01:39:17.400 --> 01:39:19.480
I'm sorry for the Indian.

01:39:19.760 --> 01:39:20.960
What is there?

01:39:21.360 --> 01:39:24.640
Tell me, what manor is this?
I need to know.

01:39:24.760 --> 01:39:27.960
It's a domain. A hunting ground.

01:39:30.840 --> 01:39:33.080
Sir, you need rest.

01:41:24.040 --> 01:41:25.480
Hurry! Fire!

01:45:27.160 --> 01:45:29.320
He's over there! Come on!

01:45:52.840 --> 01:45:55.520
Fronsac returned by Mani's side.

01:45:55.760 --> 01:45:58.280
His revenge had hardly begun,

01:45:58.520 --> 01:46:00.720
but according to Indian custom,

01:46:00.840 --> 01:46:05.200
he must be sent to his ancestors
at dawn's first light.

01:46:10.840 --> 01:46:12.240
What do you want?

01:46:13.560 --> 01:46:16.280
Too much blood has been spilled.

01:46:16.520 --> 01:46:18.640
You're in great peril here.

01:46:19.640 --> 01:46:22.160
I have business to attend to.

01:46:22.760 --> 01:46:24.600
Is it worth your life?

01:46:26.840 --> 01:46:28.880
How long have you known?

01:46:29.720 --> 01:46:31.560
I don't know what you mean.

01:46:31.640 --> 01:46:34.000
Come now, Sardis. How?

01:46:35.400 --> 01:46:37.600
How did it get this far?

01:46:38.640 --> 01:46:40.680
No one will believe you.

01:46:43.000 --> 01:46:44.440
Go away, Sardis.

01:46:46.760 --> 01:46:48.160
May God save you.

01:46:49.920 --> 01:46:51.840
May the Devil take you.

01:47:12.240 --> 01:47:16.760
You're under arrest
by order of the Intendant.

01:47:16.880 --> 01:47:18.920
Please offer no resistance.

01:47:19.040 --> 01:47:20.080
That's ridiculous!

01:47:55.760 --> 01:47:58.520
- A lady to see you.
- Later. Tonight.

01:48:07.240 --> 01:48:09.560
Get up! You've got company.

01:48:09.680 --> 01:48:13.960
- Aren't I in solitary confinement?
- Depends for whom.

01:48:23.760 --> 01:48:24.800
Sorry.

01:48:27.600 --> 01:48:30.040
Bring your guest some dinner.

01:48:32.920 --> 01:48:35.800
- How?
- Many owe me favors.

01:48:37.000 --> 01:48:39.720
Help me. I must write to the King.

01:48:41.080 --> 01:48:44.280
You'd be hung before he read your letter.

01:48:44.600 --> 01:48:46.680
I've yet to stand trial.

01:48:47.320 --> 01:48:48.440
Here.

01:48:55.360 --> 01:48:58.640
- Tell me of the Beast.
- A trained animal.

01:48:58.920 --> 01:49:01.600
Cloaked in armor. I wounded it.

01:49:04.680 --> 01:49:06.760
Why the sudden interest?

01:49:06.840 --> 01:49:07.880
Two years ago,

01:49:08.640 --> 01:49:13.040
a confidential letter from Sardis
was given to the Pope.

01:49:13.360 --> 01:49:16.800
It spoke of a newly founded
secret society

01:49:17.200 --> 01:49:20.040
whose purpose was to spread

01:49:20.120 --> 01:49:23.920
and defend, by any means,
the word of the Church.

01:49:25.040 --> 01:49:26.640
The Brotherhood.

01:49:26.960 --> 01:49:30.440
Sardis, he was using the Beast.

01:49:33.400 --> 01:49:36.760
The Beast is a warning to the King:

01:49:38.040 --> 01:49:41.760
"Heed the power of the Lord
or suffer Apocalypse."

01:49:42.360 --> 01:49:45.520
Members are known as "wolves of God."

01:49:47.720 --> 01:49:49.480
It serves the Church?

01:49:54.560 --> 01:49:59.320
Sardis serves only himself.
These wild times have made him mad.

01:49:59.480 --> 01:50:02.440
The group is beyond Rome's control.

01:50:06.800 --> 01:50:08.480
In whose employ are you?

01:50:08.600 --> 01:50:12.240
My duties include
never letting that be known.

01:50:19.560 --> 01:50:22.440
And you, you know quite enough.

01:50:32.360 --> 01:50:35.720
Mademoiselle de Morangias, what an honor.

01:50:35.920 --> 01:50:39.400
How fares the Countess? Please sit down.

01:50:41.880 --> 01:50:44.560
And your father? Still in cure?

01:50:45.440 --> 01:50:47.920
He's too fond of rich food.

01:50:49.360 --> 01:50:51.800
Sir, you've arrested Fronsac.

01:50:53.720 --> 01:50:56.320
How far a man such as he has fallen!

01:50:56.520 --> 01:50:59.960
- He's neither thief nor murderer.
- Really?

01:51:00.360 --> 01:51:03.720
Hear me, he must have had his reasons.

01:51:03.880 --> 01:51:07.960
- If they killed the Indian...
- That's another matter.

01:51:08.560 --> 01:51:12.840
You don't avenge a savage
with Christian blood.

01:51:15.200 --> 01:51:16.640
May I visit him?

01:51:27.320 --> 01:51:28.480
Impossible.

01:51:30.760 --> 01:51:31.800
Very well.

01:51:32.680 --> 01:51:35.000
Paris shall hear of this.

01:51:35.480 --> 01:51:37.040
You don't understand.

01:51:37.120 --> 01:51:39.000
Fronsac passed away...

01:51:40.200 --> 01:51:41.240
last night.

01:51:54.240 --> 01:51:57.040
In any case, they'd have hung him.

01:51:57.520 --> 01:52:00.160
Upon reflection, he was lucky.

01:52:01.120 --> 01:52:03.080
He was in your custody.

01:52:04.240 --> 01:52:05.680
Perhaps he choked.

01:52:06.200 --> 01:52:08.800
Or he caught a blight in the mattress.

01:52:08.920 --> 01:52:12.040
You're lying. You're all lying!

01:52:13.640 --> 01:52:17.000
Courage, child, it's the will of God.

01:52:20.200 --> 01:52:21.400
Come.

01:52:21.520 --> 01:52:25.120
- I'll escort you home.
- She needs rest.

01:52:28.720 --> 01:52:30.800
- Let me alone!
- It's over.

01:52:35.400 --> 01:52:40.080
He's already reeking.
Bury him quickly in an unmarked grave.

01:52:40.880 --> 01:52:45.520
She threatened to go to the King.
That girl is dangerous.

01:52:51.000 --> 01:52:53.800
<i>Fronsac was buried that very night,</i>

01:52:54.520 --> 01:52:58.160
<i>long before news of his death
reached Paris.</i>

01:52:59.000 --> 01:53:03.080
<i>No one knew what secrets
he took to his grave.</i>

01:53:05.000 --> 01:53:08.560
<i>For several days,
the Beast did not strike.</i>

01:53:09.480 --> 01:53:13.280
<i>But the sudden disappearance
of its most dauntless foe</i>

01:53:13.400 --> 01:53:15.400
<i>seemed to be a dark omen.</i>

01:53:36.560 --> 01:53:37.600
Hurry.

01:53:45.120 --> 01:53:48.000
Father, I'm guilty. I have sinned.

01:53:48.400 --> 01:53:49.720
Forgive me.

01:53:50.760 --> 01:53:54.080
Marianne, day and night I think of her.

01:53:54.880 --> 01:53:57.920
I hear her heart beating in my chest.

01:53:59.040 --> 01:54:01.760
I want her on our side, Sardis.

01:54:01.880 --> 01:54:05.680
- The Lord is testing you.
- I can't endure it.

01:54:09.040 --> 01:54:10.160
The visions!

01:54:12.880 --> 01:54:15.920
These accursed visions torment me!

01:54:19.080 --> 01:54:20.880
Deliver me, Father!

01:54:21.720 --> 01:54:23.600
I beg of you!

01:54:25.480 --> 01:54:28.240
There's only one remedy for this evil.

01:55:29.680 --> 01:55:31.520
Don't drink, Sister.

01:55:33.520 --> 01:55:35.440
They want to kill you.

01:55:36.720 --> 01:55:38.560
But I won't let them.

01:55:40.240 --> 01:55:41.760
Who does?

01:55:43.560 --> 01:55:44.640
Who?

01:55:46.360 --> 01:55:49.640
We're going to leave, just you and me.

01:55:50.800 --> 01:55:52.560
How about America?

01:55:54.720 --> 01:55:57.640
You've hurt me, but I forgive you.

01:56:03.440 --> 01:56:06.560
Please. What are you doing?

01:56:07.520 --> 01:56:08.560
Stay.

01:56:13.360 --> 01:56:17.200
- Would I harm you?
- Please stay away from me.

01:56:19.080 --> 01:56:20.880
I need you.

01:56:21.480 --> 01:56:25.040
You saved me when I was sick, no one else.

01:56:25.520 --> 01:56:28.160
The sight of your face
ended my nightmares.

01:56:28.240 --> 01:56:30.480
Your hand on my brow chased away demons.

01:56:30.600 --> 01:56:33.400
You can't imagine all I've done
to keep you near.

01:56:33.480 --> 01:56:36.160
I beg of you, don't shun me.

01:56:44.120 --> 01:56:45.400
Why?

01:56:49.520 --> 01:56:50.960
Do I disgust you?

01:56:51.040 --> 01:56:53.760
You don't frighten me. Get out.

01:56:56.280 --> 01:56:57.720
Because of this?

01:57:03.520 --> 01:57:04.800
Never fear.

01:57:06.120 --> 01:57:09.080
From now on, I'll take care of you.

01:57:10.400 --> 01:57:11.320
Look.

01:57:13.000 --> 01:57:16.000
No one knows. Only Sardis and I.

01:57:31.200 --> 01:57:33.440
Leave! Get out!

01:57:35.280 --> 01:57:36.440
Why?

01:57:38.960 --> 01:57:40.880
You're not my brother.

01:57:41.560 --> 01:57:44.240
Another man returned from Africa.

01:57:44.400 --> 01:57:47.600
That's true, but it was for you I left.

01:57:49.200 --> 01:57:51.880
All this would not be, if not for you.

01:57:52.000 --> 01:57:53.000
All this?

01:58:02.760 --> 01:58:07.440
It's your odor
that foul thing smelled on me.

01:58:10.200 --> 01:58:13.560
We're of the same blood.

01:58:16.520 --> 01:58:20.080
When father comes back, he'll kill you!

01:58:22.360 --> 01:58:26.280
Unless I kill him?
He's hindered us so long.

01:58:27.720 --> 01:58:30.720
Go ahead. Do it, go ahead!

01:58:54.040 --> 01:58:55.520
Why didn't you?

01:58:56.800 --> 01:58:58.800
Is it so difficult? Look.

01:58:58.920 --> 01:59:01.040
- Stop!
- Then you love me?

01:59:08.120 --> 01:59:09.920
I love you!

01:59:14.560 --> 01:59:17.800
Brothers, the Lord has told me

01:59:18.360 --> 01:59:20.360
the Beast will return

01:59:20.480 --> 01:59:24.800
to herald the return of values
to our decadent kingdom.

01:59:25.240 --> 01:59:27.800
And in a reborn France

01:59:28.240 --> 01:59:32.480
we shall be invisible princes,
for God is with us.

01:59:44.880 --> 01:59:47.920
The people cannot fathom the Lord's wrath.

01:59:48.320 --> 01:59:50.960
The unjust censure of the King

01:59:51.840 --> 01:59:55.080
cannot withstand the public's rage.

01:59:55.640 --> 01:59:58.120
When that wrath is at a climax,

01:59:58.240 --> 02:00:00.920
we'll bargain with the King.

02:00:01.240 --> 02:00:03.000
If he couldn't repress one,

02:00:03.120 --> 02:00:07.600
imagine if, from all over the realm,

02:00:07.720 --> 02:00:09.880
other beasts burst forth.

02:00:11.680 --> 02:00:15.440
The hour is at hand
to reap what we've sewn.

02:00:18.800 --> 02:00:21.000
Let us read from Malachi:

02:00:21.800 --> 02:00:25.960
"The word of the priest
is the depository of science,

02:00:26.240 --> 02:00:30.320
"and from his mouth is sought
knowledge of the law,

02:00:30.960 --> 02:00:33.960
"for he is the angel
of the Lord of Hosts."

02:00:34.080 --> 02:00:36.400
"He who adores the Beast

02:00:37.920 --> 02:00:40.240
"shall drink the Lord's wrath.

02:00:40.680 --> 02:00:44.760
"He shall be tormented
in the fire and brimstone

02:00:44.880 --> 02:00:46.320
"before the angels,

02:00:46.440 --> 02:00:50.440
"and the smoke shall rise
in the century of centuries."

02:00:51.320 --> 02:00:53.560
I've come back to name you:

02:00:53.800 --> 02:00:57.400
Pierre-Jean Laffont.
Geneviéve de Morangias.

02:00:57.920 --> 02:00:59.360
Maxime Des Forêts.

02:00:59.840 --> 02:01:03.120
Gontrand de Moncan. Henri Sardis.

02:01:03.960 --> 02:01:06.720
Jean-François de Morangias.

02:01:08.440 --> 02:01:09.360
Amen!

02:02:52.320 --> 02:02:53.440
Fire!

02:03:03.800 --> 02:03:07.440
Bastards! You're all under arrest!

02:03:56.000 --> 02:03:57.680
Ghost or no ghost...

02:03:59.560 --> 02:04:01.040
I'll split you in two.

02:04:13.080 --> 02:04:15.320
See? No need to hold back.

02:04:16.000 --> 02:04:17.480
I never intended to.

02:04:17.600 --> 02:04:20.800
Too late. The Beast is immortal now.

02:04:20.920 --> 02:04:23.120
Perhaps, but you are not!

02:05:12.600 --> 02:05:15.600
- You trained the Beast.
- How'd you know?

02:05:16.080 --> 02:05:17.960
You use silver bullets.

02:06:11.720 --> 02:06:13.920
Marianne, look!

02:06:26.520 --> 02:06:28.800
Marianne's not here, madman.

02:06:29.440 --> 02:06:31.560
You've united us forever.

02:07:00.320 --> 02:07:02.040
Line the bastards up!

02:07:02.280 --> 02:07:03.720
Who do you think you are?

02:07:05.640 --> 02:07:07.360
Look at them!

02:07:08.280 --> 02:07:10.720
Not so high and mighty now!

02:07:10.920 --> 02:07:12.400
Get back!

02:07:31.600 --> 02:07:34.120
- He's dead.
- Now it's certain.

02:07:36.000 --> 02:07:37.160
And Sardis?

02:07:38.000 --> 02:07:42.760
Wherever he runs, we'll find him.
Or the mountain will take him.

02:07:45.760 --> 02:07:48.200
Shall we celebrate properly?

02:07:48.800 --> 02:07:50.680
You've killed me once.

02:07:51.560 --> 02:07:53.720
The better to revive you.

02:07:55.600 --> 02:08:00.240
I could introduce you in Rome.
Will you come with me?

02:08:04.880 --> 02:08:06.000
Too late.

02:08:06.680 --> 02:08:10.960
I like you, Fronsac.
You make me forget all my duties.

02:08:21.280 --> 02:08:24.000
Leave, before I change my mind.

02:09:53.920 --> 02:09:57.680
- Marquis, what is it?
- Marianne.

02:09:58.240 --> 02:10:01.520
I've had her brought home. She's dying.

02:10:05.800 --> 02:10:08.840
Get out! Go away! All of you!

02:10:22.880 --> 02:10:24.520
Wake up!

02:10:30.000 --> 02:10:31.800
Forgive me.

02:10:36.960 --> 02:10:38.200
I love you.

02:12:02.680 --> 02:12:06.480
<i>Years passed,
but Grégoire de Fronsac</i>

02:12:06.560 --> 02:12:10.600
<i>and Marianne de Morangias
never left my memory.</i>

02:12:10.760 --> 02:12:14.160
<i>The world that made the Beast
is dying away,</i>

02:12:15.480 --> 02:12:20.160
<i>and I must hasten,
for my story, too, is ending.</i>

02:12:29.000 --> 02:12:33.680
<i>I remember Fronsac and I
at Jean-François' hideaway</i>

02:12:34.440 --> 02:12:37.720
<i>where the Beast awaited its final hour.</i>

02:14:14.880 --> 02:14:17.880
<i>The old healer told us all he knew.</i>

02:14:19.160 --> 02:14:22.400
<i>Jean-François brought
an animal back from Africa,</i>

02:14:22.520 --> 02:14:24.040
<i>who had a litter.</i>

02:14:24.480 --> 02:14:27.800
<i>Only one cub was kept, the strongest.</i>

02:14:29.120 --> 02:14:31.520
<i>Patiently and cruelly,</i>

02:14:32.280 --> 02:14:35.440
<i>he'd trained it to be vicious.</i>

02:14:45.400 --> 02:14:48.240
<i>Thus died the Beast of Gévaudan.</i>

02:14:49.160 --> 02:14:51.560
<i>And I, Thomas d'Apcher,</i>

02:14:52.120 --> 02:14:55.760
<i>am probably the last to know
the whole truth.</i>

02:15:28.520 --> 02:15:31.440
<i>The Chevalier invited me to Africa,</i>

02:15:31.960 --> 02:15:33.840
<i>but my land needed rebuilding.</i>

02:15:33.920 --> 02:15:36.400
<i>My duty was to my countrymen.</i>

02:15:37.720 --> 02:15:40.720
<i>I've often thought
of Grégoire and Marianne</i>

02:15:40.800 --> 02:15:45.440
<i>throughout these peaceful years
that have brought me to this age.</i>

02:15:47.320 --> 02:15:49.400
<i>I never saw them again,</i>

02:15:50.280 --> 02:15:54.760
<i>but I like to think they lived happily,
far from here.</i>
