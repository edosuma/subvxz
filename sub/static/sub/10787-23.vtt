saying good-bye to,

29:37.750 --> 29:39.125

not saying good-bye

40:46.250 --> 40:47.250
Yeah.

40:48.209 --> 40:49.333

Wow. I guess this is, uh...

41:02.834 --> 41:04.125
This is really it, huh?

41:07.708 --> 41:08.917
See you, Dawson.

41:10.834 --> 41:12.000
I'll see you, Joey.

41:17.959 --> 41:19.625
So what was yours, by the way?

41:21.291 --> 41:22.291
What was my what?

41:27.167 --> 41:29.542
Your all-time most life
altering moment?

41:33.959 --> 41:36.209
For all I know, it could be

41:40.209 --> 41:41.291
Saying good-bye to you.

42:02.250 --> 42:06.208
