00:01.000 --> 00:06.000
A toast to your divine victory.

00:06.000 --> 00:08.000
My divine victory.

00:09.000 --> 00:11.000
You see, it isn't your victory.

00:11.000 --> 00:15.000
It isn't your victory
because it isn't your war.

00:16.000 --> 00:21.000
You have no idea what game you're in,
where you are, who you are.

00:22.000 --> 00:24.000
The forces at play here.

00:27.000 --> 00:31.000
Taxes, victory parades,
you think that's why I'm here?

00:31.000 --> 00:34.000
I'm fighting a different war.

00:35.000 --> 00:37.000
The last war.

00:39.000 --> 00:42.000
And in that war, I'm in charge.

00:45.000 --> 00:47.000
And I always was.

00:49.000 --> 00:52.000
The journey ahead
is the journey into darkness.

00:53.000 --> 00:56.000
Druids may not survive.

00:56.000 --> 00:58.000
Did you miss me, brother?

00:59.000 --> 01:01.000
I will find her.

01:02.000 --> 01:06.000
-Do you doubt Veran?
-Do you never doubt Veran?

01:07.000 --> 01:08.000
Can I stop you there?

01:08.000 --> 01:11.000
Is that the same Veran,
who sacrificed my father,

01:11.000 --> 01:13.000
and passed me over
as king of my tribe?

01:13.000 --> 01:15.000
Kneel!

01:17.000 --> 01:20.000
You are Queen Kerra of the Cantii.

01:21.000 --> 01:23.000
We should've kept her with us.

01:23.000 --> 01:25.000
She's just a lamb.
She's not ready yet.

01:31.000 --> 01:33.000
-No.
-Oh, shit.

02:29.000 --> 02:30.000
Hungry?

02:32.000 --> 02:35.000
-They're yummy.
-I don't break bread with the dead.

02:42.000 --> 02:44.000
Don't you just love the rain?

02:46.000 --> 02:49.000
When you've seen
as many rainstorms as me,

02:49.000 --> 02:51.000
you learn to read them.

02:52.000 --> 02:55.000
When they begin or end.

03:02.000 --> 03:06.000
Look at that.
Do you not find that beautiful?

03:08.000 --> 03:10.000
It's yummy. What do you want?

03:14.000 --> 03:16.000
There's someone I want you to find.

03:39.000 --> 03:41.000
Drink this.

03:54.000 --> 03:59.000
And this. Drink it.

04:04.000 --> 04:06.000
Rub this on your tummy.

04:13.000 --> 04:16.000
Wait. It's the other way around.

04:33.000 --> 04:36.000
When I look out my window

04:39.000 --> 04:41.000
Many sights to see

04:43.000 --> 04:46.000
And when I look in my window

04:48.000 --> 04:51.000
So many different people to be

04:53.000 --> 04:55.000
Oh, no

04:55.000 --> 04:58.000
Must be the season of the witch

05:00.000 --> 05:04.000
Must be the season of the witch, yeah

05:04.000 --> 05:08.000
Must be the season of the witch

05:16.000 --> 05:20.000
The rabbits running in the ditch

05:21.000 --> 05:24.000
Beatnicks are out to make it rich

05:25.000 --> 05:31.000
Oh, no
Must be the season of the witch

05:36.000 --> 05:39.000
Morning, Bridget.

05:39.000 --> 05:41.000
Morning, Rolf.

05:43.000 --> 05:47.000
You should get up. You have a busy day.

05:51.000 --> 05:53.000
We could just stay here for a bit.

05:54.000 --> 05:57.000
Rolf. Stop it.

06:02.000 --> 06:07.000
-Where did you get that scar?
-It's not a scar. It's a burn.

06:09.000 --> 06:10.000
What happened?

06:10.000 --> 06:14.000
My father was a blacksmith.
I walked into a hot iron.

06:17.000 --> 06:18.000
Were you lonely as a child?

06:20.000 --> 06:24.000
Not especially, no. I had a sister.

06:24.000 --> 06:26.000
You never said you had a sister.

06:28.000 --> 06:33.000
We lost touch a few years ago.
After the invasion.

06:35.000 --> 06:39.000
Do you think the Romans
will ever come here, to the North?

06:39.000 --> 06:41.000
One day, maybe.

06:43.000 --> 06:45.000
But for now, we're safe.

06:51.000 --> 06:53.000
What's her name? Your sister.

06:55.000 --> 06:57.000
Her name is Kerra.

06:59.000 --> 07:00.000
Do you worry about her?

07:04.000 --> 07:06.000
Kerra's much tougher than me.

07:08.000 --> 07:10.000
She's a survivor.

07:26.000 --> 07:30.000
Don't worry. Your little man
isn't ready to say hello just yet.

07:30.000 --> 07:34.000
-She could be a girl.
-Trust me. He's a boy.

07:35.000 --> 07:38.000
Tall and fine, just like his daddy.

07:42.000 --> 07:45.000
-Morning, Rolf.
-Morning, Nyle.

07:45.000 --> 07:47.000
-Morning, Ewan. Morning, Holt.
-Morning.

07:48.000 --> 07:50.000
Ready for the big day?

07:51.000 --> 07:53.000
-You need a hand, Rolf?
-You're all right, boys.

07:53.000 --> 07:55.000
I've got this one.

07:59.000 --> 08:00.000
Come on!

08:02.000 --> 08:03.000
Come on.

08:07.000 --> 08:11.000
-What's he doing?
-He's clueless. Look at him.

08:11.000 --> 08:14.000
He's kind to our sister.
That's all I care about.

08:14.000 --> 08:15.000
Honestly, boys, I got this.

08:16.000 --> 08:18.000
Do you want to catch him
before winter comes?

08:18.000 --> 08:20.000
Come on, brothers.

08:24.000 --> 08:27.000
-Tell me the plan again.
-Ten pieces. No less than five.

08:27.000 --> 08:30.000
-You sure you'll be all right?
-Stop worrying, Rolf.

08:54.000 --> 08:56.000
-Start bidding at three.
-Five.

08:56.000 --> 08:58.000
Five. Five.

08:58.000 --> 09:01.000
-Six!
-Six. Anyone at six?

09:03.000 --> 09:06.000
Come on, now. He's a lovely specimen.
He speaks seven languages.

09:07.000 --> 09:10.000
Wherever he shits,
a fruit tree grows.

09:10.000 --> 09:14.000
Ten!
-Ten, 11.

09:14.000 --> 09:15.000
-Twelve.
-Thirteen.

09:16.000 --> 09:18.000
Thirteen. Any more than 13?

09:18.000 --> 09:20.000
Fourteen, 15, 16.

09:20.000 --> 09:22.000
-Seventeen.
-Seventeen, 18.

09:22.000 --> 09:24.000
Twenty? On my life.

09:24.000 --> 09:27.000
Bullshit. I've never got more than 15.

09:27.000 --> 09:29.000
When you know
what you're doing.

09:29.000 --> 09:31.000
Looks like drinks are on Rolf, eh?

09:34.000 --> 09:37.000
Well, Rolf, it will be a good winter.

09:37.000 --> 09:40.000
-You want a lift home?
-You boys head on.

09:40.000 --> 09:42.000
I'm gonna have one more.

09:47.000 --> 09:50.000
I'm proud of you, Rolf. Really.

09:50.000 --> 09:52.000
These last couple of years
have been hard.

09:52.000 --> 09:55.000
But I feel like I finally
found a home.

09:57.000 --> 09:59.000
-Don't go kissing any girls now.
-Go on.

09:59.000 --> 10:02.000
-Do you hear me? Do you hear me?
-Go on, go on!

10:05.000 --> 10:07.000
-Come on! -No, I'm going home.

10:07.000 --> 10:09.000
I've got to get home.

10:09.000 --> 10:11.000
-Come on, handsome.
-All right. Just one dance.

10:38.000 --> 10:39.000
Evening.

10:52.000 --> 10:56.000
Finally, tonight, some relics
from the Southern Wars.

10:57.000 --> 11:02.000
First up,
Once a queen of a mighty tribe.

11:02.000 --> 11:06.000
She wore gold in her hair,
and the rivers flowed.

11:07.000 --> 11:10.000
Her people were bounteous
and worshipful.

11:10.000 --> 11:14.000
Then she broke bread with the Romans.

11:17.000 --> 11:23.000
Now her kingdom is this filthy cage,
and she sucks cocks for bacon rind.

11:25.000 --> 11:30.000
Her name is Queen Antedia,
The Cocksucker!

11:30.000 --> 11:33.000
You're the fucking cocksuckers!

11:35.000 --> 11:39.000
Tell me, sir, have you ever
fucked a queen?

11:41.000 --> 11:44.000
Give me a wash, and she'll all yours.

11:44.000 --> 11:47.000
Now, who will give me
three silver pieces?

11:47.000 --> 11:52.000
-Three!
-Thank you, sir. I have three pieces.

11:52.000 --> 11:57.000
Oh, come on, boys.
There's still some meat on her.

11:57.000 --> 12:01.000
If you don't want to fuck her,
you could feed her to your pigs.

12:01.000 --> 12:03.000
Four!

12:03.000 --> 12:06.000
-Four pieces of silver.
-Here, boys, watch this.

12:08.000 --> 12:10.000
You thirsty, sweetheart?

12:19.000 --> 12:23.000
Delicious. Like sweet barley wine.

12:23.000 --> 12:26.000
-Five pieces.
-I have five pieces.

12:26.000 --> 12:29.000
Going once. Twice.

12:30.000 --> 12:33.000
Sold! To the gentleman on my right.

12:33.000 --> 12:36.000
Good luck, love.
I think you might need it.

12:40.000 --> 12:44.000
The gods are dead. The gods are dead.

12:44.000 --> 12:47.000
Next up, a rare lot, indeed.

12:47.000 --> 12:50.000
From the same batch, a holy relic.

12:51.000 --> 12:57.000
Daughter of a noble king,
chosen by mighty Veran himself.

12:57.000 --> 13:00.000
She reigned
but for a handful of moons,

13:00.000 --> 13:05.000
until she, too, betrayed
her tribe to the Romans.

13:07.000 --> 13:12.000
Well, now... Queen Kerra is here.

13:14.000 --> 13:16.000
All that's left of her.

13:17.000 --> 13:21.000
Now, who will give me five pieces?

13:21.000 --> 13:24.000
Oh, come on, you arseholes.

13:24.000 --> 13:29.000
You could put your coppers in it,
or help you to get to sleep at night.

13:30.000 --> 13:32.000
-Six!
-I have six over here.

13:32.000 --> 13:36.000
-Seven.
-Hey, love. Are you thirsty?

13:36.000 --> 13:38.000
Not worth it!

13:40.000 --> 13:44.000
-Ten.
-Hello.

13:44.000 --> 13:48.000
What's this? We have a new bidder.

13:48.000 --> 13:51.000
Ten pieces from the skinny chap
on my right.

13:51.000 --> 13:54.000
-Eleven.
-Fifteen.

13:54.000 --> 13:56.000
-Sixteen.
-Twenty.

13:59.000 --> 14:04.000
Twenty silver pieces.
Going once. Twice.

14:06.000 --> 14:09.000
Sold! To the gentleman here.

14:16.000 --> 14:18.000
Enjoy.

14:22.000 --> 14:24.000
What's he gonna do with it?

14:29.000 --> 14:32.000
The time has come
for us to divide our forces.

14:32.000 --> 14:35.000
Drust, Bradan, Morac...

14:37.000 --> 14:39.000
Head north to the mountain people.

14:39.000 --> 14:43.000
Morcant, Raven,
east to the wide plains.

14:43.000 --> 14:46.000
Rork, south to the coastal tribes.

14:46.000 --> 14:49.000
Festle, Haran, west to the valleys.

14:49.000 --> 14:52.000
-And where will you go, Veran?
-I go where the gods command.

14:53.000 --> 14:56.000
If you have a strategy,
we should know it.

15:03.000 --> 15:07.000
Travel by night.
Leave no trace of your passing.

15:07.000 --> 15:10.000
The tribes are scared.
They fear the future.

15:10.000 --> 15:13.000
Testify that which the gods command.

15:13.000 --> 15:16.000
Light the fire, feed the flames.

15:17.000 --> 15:21.000
Will you give your blood to write the
gods' will and defeat the Romans?

15:21.000 --> 15:23.000
-Aye.
-Aye, Veran.

15:24.000 --> 15:26.000
Aye, Veran.

15:27.000 --> 15:28.000
At dawn.

15:41.000 --> 15:42.000
I cannot go to him again.

15:42.000 --> 15:45.000
You must.
Veran is sending the tribes to fight,

15:45.000 --> 15:48.000
but they don't know
who they're up against.

15:48.000 --> 15:52.000
The Dead Man has awakened,
and only Veran knows the truth.

15:52.000 --> 15:55.000
-We... We need time.
-There is no time.

15:55.000 --> 15:57.000
The Dead Man will not wait.

16:09.000 --> 16:12.000
I am glad to see you fully recovered,
Emperor.

16:12.000 --> 16:15.000
I'm told I owe you my life.

16:15.000 --> 16:18.000
The offending slave has confessed.

16:18.000 --> 16:22.000
Seems he was captured by the Druids
and they turned his mind to theirs.

16:24.000 --> 16:27.000
-It's happened before.
-You have the Emperor's gratitude.

16:29.000 --> 16:33.000
In return, I issue this order.

16:34.000 --> 16:38.000
You are to remain here in Britannia,
find these Druids and wipe them out.

16:38.000 --> 16:41.000
-Do you understand?
-Perfectly.

16:41.000 --> 16:44.000
Dimitius will remain.

16:44.000 --> 16:47.000
You'll find him
a very diligent presence.

16:51.000 --> 16:53.000
Safe travels, Commander.

17:20.000 --> 17:23.000
It seems the Emperor
had a lucky escape.

17:23.000 --> 17:25.000
So it would seem.

17:39.000 --> 17:41.000
This is Ania.

17:41.000 --> 17:43.000
She fought many battles
for the Regni.

17:44.000 --> 17:46.000
She has sacrificed much
for this tribe.

17:47.000 --> 17:49.000
-She will travel with you.
-Welcome.

17:52.000 --> 17:54.000
Lord Veran.

17:57.000 --> 18:01.000
You traveled for five moons
across the 13 plains

18:01.000 --> 18:05.000
to bring us the will of the gods.

18:05.000 --> 18:07.000
But there was something you saw.

18:09.000 --> 18:11.000
Something you chose not to mention.

18:12.000 --> 18:17.000
So why not tell us all now
what it was that you found?

18:17.000 --> 18:19.000
-Careful, Rork.
-Did you forget?

18:20.000 --> 18:23.000
-Did it slip your mind?
-I warn you.

18:24.000 --> 18:26.000
If you take this path,
you cannot return.

18:26.000 --> 18:28.000
Then save yourself.

18:28.000 --> 18:33.000
Tell us all now what the gods
told you of the Dead Man.

18:33.000 --> 18:35.000
-Dead Man?
-What?

18:36.000 --> 18:37.000
Dead Man?

18:41.000 --> 18:45.000
Willa, tell your brothers
and sisters what you know.

18:47.000 --> 18:49.000
I... I...

18:51.000 --> 18:54.000
Quane. You know it, too. Speak!

18:54.000 --> 18:59.000
Come now. Where is your fealty
to your brothers and sisters?

19:00.000 --> 19:02.000
If I lie, then say so.

19:08.000 --> 19:13.000
I saw the Dead Man's sign.

19:13.000 --> 19:15.000
-He speaks true.
-Are you certain?

19:18.000 --> 19:20.000
I swear.

19:23.000 --> 19:29.000
So, Second Man, tell us,
is not the Dead Man awakened?

19:31.000 --> 19:33.000
-Do not question my ways.
-Answer me!

19:33.000 --> 19:35.000
Do not question my ways!

19:37.000 --> 19:40.000
-Are you not in league with Lokka?
-No.

19:42.000 --> 19:44.000
Did you not meet
with the Roman general

19:44.000 --> 19:46.000
and take him to meet our dead?

19:47.000 --> 19:49.000
I did.

19:54.000 --> 19:57.000
-Are you not Lokka?
-I am the Veran.

19:57.000 --> 20:01.000
-You lie!
-I am the Veran. I will die the Veran!

20:06.000 --> 20:10.000
On behalf of the Tribe of Iudocus
and the Black Skull,

20:10.000 --> 20:12.000
I, Rork...

20:14.000 --> 20:15.000
..challenge the Veran.

20:22.000 --> 20:24.000
So be it.

20:32.000 --> 20:33.000
If you ask me, you were lucky.

20:34.000 --> 20:37.000
When my time came
to walk toward the Sacred Wind,

20:38.000 --> 20:42.000
I broke both legs, my pelvis,
my ankle, my jaw, and four fingers.

20:43.000 --> 20:46.000
I was pissing blood for a month.

20:46.000 --> 20:48.000
I note you chose
not to mention that.

20:49.000 --> 20:50.000
It's not about the flight.

20:52.000 --> 20:56.000
It's about faith. Surrender.
Facing the impossible.

20:56.000 --> 21:00.000
That explains why I feel an overwhelming
sense of achievement right now.

21:04.000 --> 21:07.000
What are you staring at? Oh, I get it.

21:09.000 --> 21:12.000
-I see.
-I haven't eaten for two fucking moons.

21:12.000 --> 21:16.000
How many times do I have to tell you?
Do not curse in the Holy Delve.

21:18.000 --> 21:22.000
The betwixt must pass through air,
fire, water, earth.

21:22.000 --> 21:25.000
She must fast for two moons
between each journey.

21:25.000 --> 21:28.000
Only then will she receive
the Great Vision.

21:28.000 --> 21:32.000
Have you received any Great Visions
lately? Any visions at all? No?

21:32.000 --> 21:35.000
Meanwhile, our legions of dead await.

21:35.000 --> 21:39.000
But, hey, no pressure. Take your time.

21:39.000 --> 21:41.000
-Please...
-Repeat after me.

21:42.000 --> 21:44.000
"I await the Great Vision."

21:46.000 --> 21:50.000
Say it.
-I await the Great Vision.

21:50.000 --> 21:51.000
There.

21:53.000 --> 21:54.000
Now, you know the rules.

21:55.000 --> 21:59.000
When the moon fills, we must go
to the sacred weed beds and...

21:59.000 --> 22:01.000
Cut the reeds with a silver sickle.

22:01.000 --> 22:04.000
To weave the virgin's bed
for the next moon.

22:04.000 --> 22:06.000
Then you can eat.

22:08.000 --> 22:10.000
Hey.

22:19.000 --> 22:22.000
I get it. I did this years ago.

22:22.000 --> 22:25.000
-I was a Druid before you were born.
-Briefly.

22:27.000 --> 22:31.000
The Prophecy of Veran
is the most important prophecy

22:31.000 --> 22:33.000
in the history of this land.

22:33.000 --> 22:36.000
And who did Veran trust with it?

22:36.000 --> 22:40.000
This is your path, and you must walk it.

22:40.000 --> 22:42.000
Only you.

23:08.000 --> 23:10.000
Bridget?

23:24.000 --> 23:27.000
Rolf? Where have you been?

23:27.000 --> 23:30.000
We've been waiting all night
to surprise you.

23:32.000 --> 23:35.000
-It's a boy.
-Three cheers for Rolf!

23:39.000 --> 23:44.000
What kept you, brother? No matter.
Daddy's home now.

23:44.000 --> 23:46.000
Yeah.

23:49.000 --> 23:54.000
I... I don't have the words to express
how I feel right now.

23:56.000 --> 23:59.000
The first-born son is a sacred son.

23:59.000 --> 24:02.000
The first-born son is a sacred son.

24:02.000 --> 24:05.000
May he walk the earth
with the protection of the gods.

24:05.000 --> 24:09.000
May he walk the earth
with the protection of the gods.

24:09.000 --> 24:13.000
From this day, Rolf,
this child is your arrow.

24:13.000 --> 24:18.000
May he soar out over the forest
and into the open sky.

24:19.000 --> 24:23.000
You must give him a name, so that
when the Druids come to bless him,

24:23.000 --> 24:26.000
he will be known to the lakes
and the mountains

24:26.000 --> 24:29.000
and the mighty sky beyond.

24:29.000 --> 24:32.000
This is truly a blessed day
for you, Rolf. So much bounty.

24:33.000 --> 24:38.000
I want my son to be named after somebody
who is good and strong,

24:38.000 --> 24:44.000
and noble, handsome, funny, and honest.

24:45.000 --> 24:49.000
His name will be Rolf.

24:50.000 --> 24:55.000
-All hail the Druids!
-The Druids!

24:55.000 --> 24:57.000
All hail the Druids.

25:07.000 --> 25:09.000
Veran?

25:10.000 --> 25:14.000
Please. Forgive me.

25:16.000 --> 25:20.000
-I didn't... Quane...
-Quane has fled.

25:21.000 --> 25:24.000
-And you too must leave.
-But I...

25:27.000 --> 25:29.000
You have betrayed me.

25:31.000 --> 25:34.000
When this is over,
you must leave the Druids.

25:36.000 --> 25:40.000
-You are outcast.
-Please, Veran!

25:46.000 --> 25:49.000
-Why have you lied to us?
-Go!

25:58.000 --> 26:01.000
The gods decree if one of the Twelve
challenges Veran,

26:01.000 --> 26:03.000
then there is mortal combat.

26:06.000 --> 26:10.000
The true Veran will cut the head
from the other.

26:23.000 --> 26:25.000
I just couldn't be happier.

26:27.000 --> 26:29.000
Bridget, there's something
I need to tell you.

26:29.000 --> 26:31.000
What's wrong?

26:33.000 --> 26:37.000
My name is not Rolf.

26:39.000 --> 26:41.000
My name is Phelan.

26:43.000 --> 26:45.000
-Phelan of the Cantii.
-What?

26:45.000 --> 26:49.000
Son of Pellenor. I'm a prince.

26:52.000 --> 26:55.000
I don't understand.

26:55.000 --> 26:57.000
It's a long story.

26:59.000 --> 27:01.000
I was born royal.

27:01.000 --> 27:04.000
My father, King Pellenor,
he was a good man.

27:04.000 --> 27:10.000
But he was cold,
and ruled without mercy.

27:11.000 --> 27:14.000
When I was nine,
my father had my mother sacrificed,

27:14.000 --> 27:16.000
at the behest of the Druids.

27:17.000 --> 27:20.000
She had Roman blood, you see.

27:20.000 --> 27:22.000
When the Romans returned,

27:22.000 --> 27:25.000
the Druids decided that it was he
who should be sacrificed.

27:25.000 --> 27:27.000
Pellenor, I mean.

27:27.000 --> 27:31.000
Then the Druids chose my sister
over me to rule in his stead.

27:31.000 --> 27:33.000
I thought I was part of a prophecy...

27:33.000 --> 27:35.000
To do with Brenna,
the goddess of war...

27:35.000 --> 27:39.000
That didn't pan out.
And so, I decided...

27:39.000 --> 27:41.000
I decided to start again.

27:43.000 --> 27:46.000
I ran away. I changed my name.
I came here.

27:46.000 --> 27:48.000
I met you in the forest.

27:52.000 --> 27:54.000
What the fuck are you talking about?

28:02.000 --> 28:05.000
I'm telling you I'm not Rolf.
I'm not a farmer.

28:05.000 --> 28:09.000
-I don't know a thing about farming.
-Don't believe you.

28:09.000 --> 28:11.000
-It's true.
-You don't know farming?

28:12.000 --> 28:16.000
Then explain how you sold a bullock
you raised for 20 silver pieces.

28:17.000 --> 28:20.000
Right. Right.
You see, that's the other thing.

28:20.000 --> 28:22.000
-I don't understand.
-The 20 silver pieces.

28:24.000 --> 28:27.000
-I don't have it.
-What? Where is it?

28:27.000 --> 28:30.000
-I spent it.
-You spent it?

28:30.000 --> 28:32.000
Last night, at the market,
there was an auction.

28:32.000 --> 28:34.000
What were they selling?

28:37.000 --> 28:40.000
My sister's head.

28:40.000 --> 28:42.000
And I bought it.

28:42.000 --> 28:45.000
-You bought your sister's head?
-Yes.

28:45.000 --> 28:47.000
How much did you pay for it?

28:51.000 --> 28:52.000
Twenty silver pieces.

28:59.000 --> 29:01.000
What about our baby?

29:01.000 --> 29:05.000
I'm so sorry, Bridget. I'm so sorry.

29:06.000 --> 29:09.000
I tried to run away, to flee my destiny.

29:10.000 --> 29:11.000
But last night, at the market,

29:12.000 --> 29:14.000
I understood something
for the first time.

29:14.000 --> 29:16.000
What did you understand?

29:16.000 --> 29:19.000
The Druids said the gods
have a fate for us.

29:19.000 --> 29:21.000
That I must find mine.
That there is a light.

29:22.000 --> 29:24.000
And it was my task to find it
and to protect it,

29:25.000 --> 29:28.000
and to help it grow into a raging fire.

29:28.000 --> 29:32.000
Last night, I was given a second chance.
It wasn't chance, it was destiny.

29:32.000 --> 29:34.000
It was my sister.

29:34.000 --> 29:38.000
All the gods telling me that there
was something I needed to do.

29:43.000 --> 29:47.000
Holt, Holt! Get out here.

29:47.000 --> 29:49.000
He's bought his sister's head.

30:00.000 --> 30:01.000
Oh, no.

30:06.000 --> 30:09.000
Now you listen here. Your name is Rolf.

30:09.000 --> 30:12.000
Husband to Bridget.
Father of little Rolf.

30:13.000 --> 30:15.000
You're not a prince. There's no quest.

30:15.000 --> 30:18.000
You're Rolf, the fucking farmer.

30:25.000 --> 30:29.000
-What's your name, boy?
-Phelan.

30:36.000 --> 30:39.000
-What's your name?
-It's Phelan!

30:46.000 --> 30:52.000
-What's your name?
-I am Phelan of the Cantii.

31:05.000 --> 31:08.000
-What's your name?
-It's Phelan.

31:17.000 --> 31:19.000
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!

31:24.000 --> 31:26.000
Good night, Rolf.

31:31.000 --> 31:33.000
Good night, Bridget.

32:05.000 --> 32:08.000
As Veran, you are the oak.

32:15.000 --> 32:20.000
As challenger, you are the river.

32:29.000 --> 32:31.000
May the gods speak!

32:44.000 --> 32:47.000
The challenger strikes first!

33:30.000 --> 33:32.000
Let the gods speak.

34:26.000 --> 34:28.000
Peace be upon you, Druid.

34:54.000 --> 34:57.000
I am the Veran!

34:58.000 --> 35:00.000
I will show you the way!

35:03.000 --> 35:05.000
Hero!

35:06.000 --> 35:09.000
Hero! Hero!

35:09.000 --> 35:12.000
Hero! Hero! Hero!

35:20.000 --> 35:22.000
Hero! Hero!

35:24.000 --> 35:28.000
Hero! Hero! Hero!

35:47.000 --> 35:48.000
Goodbye, little prince.

37:11.000 --> 37:16.000
Oh, my sister.
I wish I had half your strength.

37:16.000 --> 37:21.000
But I won't let you down. I promise.

37:22.000 --> 37:24.000
I'll do whatever it takes.

37:24.000 --> 37:28.000
For I truly know now
that there is a light in this world.

37:29.000 --> 37:32.000
There is a light...

37:46.000 --> 37:47.000
What do they say?

37:49.000 --> 37:51.000
They say you are the Veran.

37:52.000 --> 37:55.000
Nothing more? Speak the truth.

37:58.000 --> 38:03.000
A few whisper of trickery.
Of dark magic.

38:05.000 --> 38:06.000
And what do you say?

38:08.000 --> 38:12.000
I say the gods have spoken.

38:16.000 --> 38:18.000
Leave me.

38:30.000 --> 38:34.000
We're looking for stories,
fables, miracles.

38:34.000 --> 38:37.000
This sort of thing spreads fast.
Take silver, loosen tongues.

38:37.000 --> 38:39.000
So, a lone girl?

38:40.000 --> 38:42.000
She may be with her teacher or mentor.

38:42.000 --> 38:44.000
A small group. You know, followers.

38:44.000 --> 38:46.000
Followers or disciples?

38:50.000 --> 38:54.000
Now, now.
Let's not get ahead of ourselves.

40:15.000 --> 40:17.000
Have an apple.

40:19.000 --> 40:21.000
They're yummy.

40:28.000 --> 40:32.000
That's it. It's good, no?
Gobble, gobble.

40:34.000 --> 40:37.000
-Who are you?
-I'm the apple man.

40:37.000 --> 40:40.000
The man with the apples.
The Apple King.

40:40.000 --> 40:44.000
I eat the apple and the pips fall
and grow into new trees,

40:44.000 --> 40:46.000
which bloom and grow new apples,

40:46.000 --> 40:49.000
I bring you the apple
and you gobble it up.

40:49.000 --> 40:50.000
Gobble, gobble.

40:52.000 --> 40:55.000
Slow down. Not so fast or you'll choke.

40:58.000 --> 41:00.000
You're King Pellenor's son.

41:01.000 --> 41:06.000
Your sister, Kerra, came to you
this moon. She found you.

41:08.000 --> 41:12.000
You know the Druid Veran?
He who speaks for the gods?

41:14.000 --> 41:16.000
-I do.
-Good.

41:18.000 --> 41:20.000
There's something I want you to do.

41:22.000 --> 41:23.000
What's your name?

41:25.000 --> 41:28.000
Forgive me. That's so rude.

41:28.000 --> 41:33.000
I've been alone such a long, long time,
and my manners just...

41:34.000 --> 41:36.000
My name...

41:36.000 --> 41:39.000
My name is Harka.

41:43.000 --> 41:48.000
And how exactly, Harka,
do you fit into all this?

41:58.000 --> 41:59.000
I am all of this.
