WEBVTT

00:04.605 --> 00:06.107
Previously on ER:

00:06.140 --> 00:08.542
So why do you have
a PICC line?

00:08.576 --> 00:11.045
Uh, stage three "C"
testicular cancer.

00:11.079 --> 00:12.313
You have a kid?

00:12.346 --> 00:13.381
He's being raised
by good people.

00:13.414 --> 00:16.283
Aren't you good people?

00:16.317 --> 00:18.452
I was worried about you
because I love you.

00:18.486 --> 00:19.820
You mean
you think I'm crazy?

00:19.853 --> 00:22.356
Mentally unstable.

00:22.390 --> 00:24.092
Suddenly plagued
by a psychiatric illness.

00:24.125 --> 00:26.460
What do you think?

00:26.494 --> 00:29.363
You mother asked us to notify
you that a small aircraft

00:29.397 --> 00:31.499
your brother Eric Wyzcenski
was flying has disappeared.

00:31.532 --> 00:33.334
She was unable
to reach you by phone.

00:33.367 --> 00:36.137
Explain to me how somebody
just goes off radar.

00:41.242 --> 00:43.211
( keys jingling in door )

00:45.113 --> 00:47.515
( clock alarm beeping )

00:50.284 --> 00:51.352
( drops keys on table )

00:53.154 --> 00:54.855
Abby?

00:54.888 --> 00:57.225
( beeping continues )

00:59.560 --> 01:01.395
( unzips jacket )

01:01.429 --> 01:03.597
( beeping continues )

01:03.631 --> 01:07.235
Abby.

01:16.277 --> 01:17.545

01:30.391 --> 01:32.260
( train clacking )

01:45.173 --> 01:47.275
KOVAC:
Kerry!

01:47.308 --> 01:48.309
Sorry.

01:48.342 --> 01:49.510
The intercom thing is broken.

01:49.543 --> 01:51.479
Did I wake you?

01:51.512 --> 01:52.613
No.

01:52.646 --> 01:53.847
Good.

01:54.848 --> 01:56.184
Want to come in?

01:56.184 --> 01:57.818
Uh... no. I'm on my way to work.

01:57.851 --> 02:01.289
You remember that place where
you used to practice medicine?

02:01.322 --> 02:02.756
I told you
I needed some time off.

02:02.790 --> 02:04.558
Yeah, and
you've had it.

02:04.592 --> 02:06.827
Rumor is you've quit,
but I've seen nothing official

02:06.860 --> 02:08.295
so I've scheduled you to work

02:08.329 --> 02:09.497
the 12:00 to 12:00
shift today.

02:09.530 --> 02:11.332
I still have some things to do.

02:11.365 --> 02:14.235
Yeah, and one of them is to
decide whether you still want

02:14.268 --> 02:16.204
to be a doctor.

02:16.204 --> 02:18.239
Be in by noon or don't
bother coming back.

02:24.512 --> 02:25.546
Hey!

02:25.579 --> 02:27.748
WOMAN:
My God!

02:27.781 --> 02:29.350
Oh, my God!

02:34.222 --> 02:35.589
WEAVER:
Oh, God, don't move.

02:35.623 --> 02:37.525
Don't move. Call 9-1-1!

02:37.558 --> 02:38.926
Don't move. Hey!

02:38.959 --> 02:40.461
Wait, wait, wait!

02:40.494 --> 02:41.662
Come back here!

02:41.695 --> 02:44.798
You could be
seriously injured!

02:44.832 --> 02:46.534
You assho...!

03:36.684 --> 03:38.619
( clattering )

03:43.757 --> 03:44.157
( gasps )

03:44.191 --> 03:47.361
You scared me.

03:48.329 --> 03:50.664
You okay?

03:50.698 --> 03:53.601
When did you get here?

03:53.634 --> 03:55.869
A couple hours ago.

03:55.903 --> 03:58.739
You were still sleeping.

04:00.908 --> 04:03.911
Any news?

04:05.078 --> 04:07.548
How about some breakfast?

04:07.581 --> 04:08.916
Can you eat?

04:10.083 --> 04:12.453
Did the phone ring?

04:14.422 --> 04:16.589
I thought I heard
the phone ring.

04:16.624 --> 04:18.726
No.

04:18.759 --> 04:20.327
You could just leave
that stuff.

04:20.327 --> 04:21.562
I'll clean it up later.

04:21.595 --> 04:23.631
You want some aspirin?

04:23.664 --> 04:26.867
Will you call me
if they call here?

04:26.900 --> 04:28.402
Where you going?

04:28.436 --> 04:31.339
I took a shift.

04:33.106 --> 04:34.041
You're going in?

04:34.074 --> 04:35.443
I've got to keep busy.

04:35.476 --> 04:36.710
Well, let's go
do something.

04:36.744 --> 04:38.011
You must be exhausted.

04:38.045 --> 04:39.547
Don't go to work.
I can't drop it.

04:39.580 --> 04:41.048
I'll call for you.
I'm going to work.

04:41.081 --> 04:42.950
Hey, hey, hey.

04:48.356 --> 04:51.892
They're going
to find him.

04:51.925 --> 04:54.995
Thank you
for coming back.

04:56.997 --> 04:58.866
If you cancel your cell
phone and call your bank,

04:58.899 --> 05:00.000
you should be okay.

05:00.033 --> 05:01.602
Yeah, I got to
renew my license,

05:01.635 --> 05:03.404
get a new phone,
replace all my credit cards.

05:03.437 --> 05:04.972
Hey, listen up!

05:05.005 --> 05:08.008
If anybody gets a scruffy
white male in his 20s

05:08.041 --> 05:11.379
who looks like he got hit
by a car, find me.

05:11.379 --> 05:12.079
Where's Pratt?

05:12.112 --> 05:13.781
Paramedic ride-along.

05:13.814 --> 05:15.783
What, did you clip somebody
on the way to work, boss?

05:15.816 --> 05:16.884
I wish.

05:16.917 --> 05:17.985
LEWIS:
Hey, where were you?

05:18.018 --> 05:18.952
CHEN:
Curtain Three.

05:18.986 --> 05:20.488
No, when I needed you.

05:20.521 --> 05:22.456
I called you about a
dozen times last night.

05:22.490 --> 05:23.991
Oh, I must have had
my phone off.

05:24.024 --> 05:26.394
We had a deal-- if I call
you and it rings once

05:26.394 --> 05:28.729
you're supposed to call
my cell and bail me out.

05:28.762 --> 05:30.498
Wait, I thought you canceled
with that guy.

05:30.531 --> 05:32.132
Well... I did, but
he kept calling me,

05:32.165 --> 05:33.734
so I just met him
later for drinks.

05:33.767 --> 05:35.035
Oh, you caved.

05:35.068 --> 05:36.003
I know, I'm a sucker.

05:36.036 --> 05:37.037
Was it that bad?

05:37.070 --> 05:38.606
Well, let me put it
this way--

05:38.639 --> 05:39.740
I almost had to fake it.

05:39.773 --> 05:40.641
An orgasm?

05:40.674 --> 05:41.775
A seizure.

05:41.809 --> 05:43.043
I called you at 11:00
to commiserate

05:43.076 --> 05:44.445
but you still weren't home.

05:44.478 --> 05:45.879
I spent the night
at his place.

05:45.913 --> 05:47.047
Whose place?
His.

05:47.080 --> 05:48.682
"Spent the night,"
spent the night?

05:48.716 --> 05:49.950
GALLANT:
Hey, Dr. Lewis.

05:49.983 --> 05:51.719
Do we lavage
for a rectal temp of 92?

05:51.752 --> 05:53.120
Is she altered?

05:53.153 --> 05:54.855
Yeah, but she has a history
of Alzheimer's.

05:54.888 --> 05:55.756
I want details.

05:55.789 --> 05:57.024
Hi, I'm Dr. Lewis.

05:57.057 --> 06:00.027
She wandered outside
for over an hour

06:00.060 --> 06:02.162
before I realized she was gone.

06:02.195 --> 06:04.064
Passive external
rewarming.

06:04.097 --> 06:07.167
Put her on heated
humidified O2 by mask.

06:07.200 --> 06:08.736
Uh, she's usually more alert.

06:08.769 --> 06:09.870
They upped her medicine.

06:09.903 --> 06:12.105
Aricept.

06:12.139 --> 06:13.073
Aricept.

06:13.106 --> 06:14.875
WEAVER:
Okay.

06:14.908 --> 06:17.978
She, uh, probably just has
a mild case of hypothermia.

06:18.011 --> 06:19.780
I'll check on her
as she warms up.

06:19.813 --> 06:20.814
Thank you.

06:24.117 --> 06:25.719
What are you doing back here?

06:25.753 --> 06:26.887
Visiting.

06:26.920 --> 06:28.589
Respiratory distress.

06:28.622 --> 06:30.157
I think it's pneumonia.

06:30.190 --> 06:31.992
BOY:
Do I really have
to wear this thing?

06:32.025 --> 06:34.562
I mean, I've just got
a cough, right?

06:34.595 --> 06:35.729
Temp's 102.6.

06:35.763 --> 06:37.030
Neutropenic two days ago.

06:37.064 --> 06:38.499
( sighs )

06:38.532 --> 06:39.800
You have no white blood cells

06:39.833 --> 06:41.535
and this place is crawling
with germs.

06:41.569 --> 06:43.971
CBC, blood
and sputum culture,

06:44.004 --> 06:46.006
chest X ray
and half a gram

06:46.039 --> 06:47.875
of imipenem IV.

06:47.908 --> 06:48.842
Did you miss me?

06:48.876 --> 06:50.077
No.

06:50.110 --> 06:51.044
Mmm.

06:53.547 --> 06:56.083
One of my guys found him
this morning when he opened up.

06:56.116 --> 06:57.585
He's a bum.

06:57.618 --> 06:59.753
Must have crawled in here
last night sometime

06:59.787 --> 07:02.022
after we locked up.

07:02.055 --> 07:04.525
( opening car door )

07:10.030 --> 07:11.031
I can't get a pulse.

07:11.064 --> 07:12.700
Get me the quick-look paddles.

07:12.733 --> 07:13.867
Sorry, Doc.

07:13.901 --> 07:15.836
This is our show.
You just watch.

07:15.869 --> 07:17.137
Then why am I here?

07:17.170 --> 07:18.906
To appreciate what we do.

07:21.074 --> 07:23.677
No pulse. No resps.

07:26.514 --> 07:28.248
Ooh...

07:28.281 --> 07:29.750
Looks like lividity.

07:29.783 --> 07:31.685
Is that some
sort of disease?

07:31.719 --> 07:32.953
It's pooling blood.

07:32.986 --> 07:34.054
This guy's dead.

07:34.087 --> 07:35.122
Hey.

07:35.155 --> 07:36.624
Where you going?

07:36.657 --> 07:38.025
Back to the bus.

07:38.058 --> 07:39.760
You're supposed
to observe us.

07:39.793 --> 07:41.662
This guy is a corpse.

07:41.695 --> 07:44.031
And whatever you two do with
corpses, I don't need to see.

07:44.064 --> 07:46.066
I'm going back in the rig
where it's warm.

07:46.099 --> 07:47.701
Hey, Doc.

07:47.735 --> 07:49.036
If you pronounce this guy,

07:49.069 --> 07:51.104
we can call the coroner
and all get out of here.

07:51.138 --> 07:52.706
I thought this was your show.

07:52.740 --> 07:55.242
That's more of a
guideline than a rule.

07:55.275 --> 07:57.144
( sighs )

07:57.177 --> 07:59.547
( knocking on door )

08:01.248 --> 08:03.083
( knocking continues )

08:03.116 --> 08:05.853
Yeah?

08:05.886 --> 08:07.688
( knocking )

08:07.721 --> 08:09.156
( groans )

08:09.189 --> 08:10.858
Yeah.

08:10.891 --> 08:13.226
( clears throat )

08:16.163 --> 08:17.565
Hi, John.

08:17.598 --> 08:18.899
Maggie.

08:18.932 --> 08:20.634
Is Abby home?

08:20.668 --> 08:22.035
Um... no, no.

08:22.069 --> 08:24.137
She went to work.

08:24.171 --> 08:26.073
Work?

08:26.106 --> 08:27.741
WEAVER:
What did he take?
Crystal meth.

08:27.775 --> 08:29.009
BOY:
He was just
smoking some glass.

08:29.042 --> 08:30.611
I think I'm having
a heart attack.

08:30.644 --> 08:32.212
What do I...?
Wait, you can hear it,
listen.

08:32.245 --> 08:33.780
Seriously.
You better do something

08:33.813 --> 08:35.148
before it bursts
out of his chest.

08:35.182 --> 08:36.750
You think this is funny?
Yeah,

08:36.784 --> 08:37.918
he never smoked before.

08:37.951 --> 08:39.152
He just started puking
and freaked out.

08:39.186 --> 08:41.221
The long-term side effects
of crystal meth

08:41.254 --> 08:43.323
include brain damage,
paranoia, hallucinations...

08:43.356 --> 08:43.991
Whoa!

08:44.024 --> 08:45.258
Later, Zeki.

08:45.292 --> 08:47.094
Don't let them give you
a baboon heart.

08:47.127 --> 08:49.296
( breathlessly ):
I didn't even want to do it.

08:49.329 --> 08:50.631
Please don't let me die.

08:50.664 --> 08:51.599
CBC,

08:51.632 --> 08:52.332
tox screen
and a UA.

08:52.365 --> 08:55.636
What is...?

08:55.669 --> 08:56.804
What?
Your brain.

08:56.837 --> 08:58.171
Let's get him on
a cardiac monitor

08:58.205 --> 09:00.040
for a couple of hours
until he calms down.

09:00.073 --> 09:02.042
Give him two of Ativan
and then call his parents.

09:02.075 --> 09:03.010
No, no, don't call my parents.

09:03.043 --> 09:04.311
My parents will kill me.

09:04.344 --> 09:05.979
No, drugs will kill
you, not your parents.

09:06.013 --> 09:07.047
You don't know my parents.

09:07.080 --> 09:07.815
MAN:
Need some help here!

09:07.848 --> 09:08.982
WOMAN:
Help...!

09:09.016 --> 09:11.118
WOMAN:
Jared? Jared, wake-wake up!

09:11.151 --> 09:12.219
Get a gurney.

09:12.252 --> 09:13.654
WOMAN:
Help!

09:13.687 --> 09:14.755
Help!

09:14.788 --> 09:15.989
Okay, what happened?

09:16.023 --> 09:16.924
My son.

09:16.957 --> 09:17.825
He got run over.

09:17.858 --> 09:18.992
Get Weaver back here.

09:19.026 --> 09:20.828
I need a backboard
and a c-collar.

09:20.861 --> 09:22.630
MAN:
You should've
called 9-1-1.

09:22.663 --> 09:23.897
WOMAN:
They weren't coming.

09:23.931 --> 09:25.132
Okay, put him
down slowly.

09:25.165 --> 09:26.934
Try not to move his
head or his neck.

09:26.967 --> 09:28.636
Prep a trauma room
and page surgery.

09:28.669 --> 09:29.803
What's his name?

09:29.837 --> 09:30.771
Jared.

09:30.804 --> 09:31.839
Jared, can you hear me?

09:31.872 --> 09:33.040
Can you open your eyes?

09:33.073 --> 09:35.809
I got a pulse
and shallow resps.

09:35.843 --> 09:37.077
Did you see the car
that hit him?

09:37.110 --> 09:40.380
My car. I hit him.

09:40.413 --> 09:45.653
Spiders, snakes, scorpions,
any member of the weasel family

09:45.686 --> 09:47.287
rats, any kind of vermin--

09:47.320 --> 09:51.058
these are thing I spray for;
these are not pets.

09:51.091 --> 09:52.926
Bunnies, puppies, kittens.

09:52.960 --> 09:54.928
Anything you can cuddle,
those are pets.

09:54.962 --> 09:56.229
Which do you have?

09:56.263 --> 09:57.665
Nothing.
Breathe.

09:57.665 --> 09:58.932
I'm not kidding.

09:58.966 --> 10:00.834
They banned me
from the pet store.

10:00.868 --> 10:03.837
They keep my picture posted
by the gerbils.

10:03.871 --> 10:05.038
But you're a doctor.

10:05.072 --> 10:07.641
Please, I'm only good
with people.

10:07.675 --> 10:08.709
Breathe.

10:08.742 --> 10:10.077
( inhales )

10:10.110 --> 10:11.779
Although I had
sea monkeys once.

10:11.812 --> 10:13.080
Breathe.

10:13.113 --> 10:15.048
And on the package
they're really cute.

10:15.082 --> 10:17.084
These little families
swimming around

10:17.117 --> 10:20.788
with crowns on their head
through the underwater castle.
Yeah.

10:20.821 --> 10:22.355
Turns out they're
just brine shrimp.

10:22.389 --> 10:23.791
( chuckles )

10:23.824 --> 10:25.058
Everybody knows that.

10:25.092 --> 10:27.127
How old were you
when this happened?

10:27.160 --> 10:28.061
Thirty.

10:28.095 --> 10:29.096
You-you...

10:29.129 --> 10:30.197
I'm just kidding.
Oh.

10:30.230 --> 10:32.232
I was a teenager,
just like you.

10:32.265 --> 10:34.134
Okay,
I'll check on you later.

10:34.167 --> 10:37.304
I'll be here.

10:37.337 --> 10:38.939
He's back.

10:38.972 --> 10:41.208
Yeah, I thought I buffed him up
good enough last time.

10:41.241 --> 10:43.410
Sure he's just not
back for the company?

10:43.443 --> 10:44.812
I think he has
a crush on you.

10:44.845 --> 10:46.113
Oh, please.

10:46.146 --> 10:47.948
For starters, I'm
old enough to be...

10:47.981 --> 10:49.116
Well, I'm an older woman.

10:49.149 --> 10:51.018
Mmm, here's to you,
Mrs. Robinson.

10:51.051 --> 10:52.285
MARQUEZ:
Dr. Lewis.

10:52.319 --> 10:53.887
Lab and films are back
on your boyfriend.

10:53.921 --> 10:55.422
You guys are sick.

10:55.455 --> 10:57.224
And Mrs. Langston
is starting to
come around

10:57.257 --> 10:58.826
when you get
a chance.
Thanks.

10:58.859 --> 11:01.394
You know, younger men
have a lot of energy.

11:01.428 --> 11:02.896
Not when they have cancer.

11:02.930 --> 11:04.331
Oh, sorry.

11:04.364 --> 11:06.734
You know, sometimes I forget
they're sick.

11:06.734 --> 11:08.101
I know. Me, too.

11:08.135 --> 11:10.203
So... you and Pratt are going

11:10.237 --> 11:11.471
together now?

11:11.504 --> 11:14.107
You think he thinks that?

11:14.141 --> 11:16.109
I don't know
what would give him that idea.

11:16.143 --> 11:17.077
Have you guys
seen Abby?

11:17.110 --> 11:18.111
Uh, yeah, Trauma Two.

11:18.145 --> 11:20.013
Thought she was working triage.

11:20.047 --> 11:21.849
Bad MVA.
Little boy.

11:21.882 --> 11:22.783
Apneic.

11:22.816 --> 11:23.450
WEAVER:
6-0 cuffed tube

11:23.483 --> 11:25.152
and a two mac blade.

11:25.185 --> 11:26.253
I-I thought he was in the house.
He must've run out

11:26.286 --> 11:27.487
to say good-bye.

11:27.520 --> 11:29.089
Full trauma panel,
type and cross for six.

11:29.122 --> 11:30.490
Oh, my God.
I was-I wasn't going fast.

11:30.523 --> 11:32.059
I was just backing up.

11:32.092 --> 11:34.027
I-I was just backing up.
The drugs are in.

11:34.061 --> 11:35.095
( sobbing )
He's loose.

11:35.128 --> 11:36.096
Set of crits
and a foley.

11:36.129 --> 11:37.397
Sats are down to 91.

11:39.099 --> 11:41.168
Cricoid pressure.

11:42.903 --> 11:45.438
Suction.

11:45.472 --> 11:47.107
No.

11:47.140 --> 11:48.141
She wants to talk to you.

11:48.175 --> 11:49.042
No!
Abby.

11:49.076 --> 11:50.077
Now.

11:50.110 --> 11:52.045
I can't.

11:53.546 --> 11:55.949
WEAVER:
John.

11:55.983 --> 11:57.150
What's happening?

11:57.184 --> 11:58.852
Your son
isn't breathing

11:58.886 --> 11:59.953
on his own.

12:31.551 --> 12:33.854
That was fast.

12:33.887 --> 12:36.824
Well, your white blood
count's up to 1,900,

12:36.824 --> 12:38.491
with 80% segs
and bands.

12:38.525 --> 12:41.829
Uh, my immune system's back.

12:41.829 --> 12:44.531
Yes, it is.

12:45.866 --> 12:48.001
But I have pneumonia?

12:48.035 --> 12:51.438
Because your metastatic lesions
haven't decreased in size.

12:57.044 --> 12:59.546
But I had two more cycles.

13:01.214 --> 13:04.151
They should have responded
by now.

13:06.253 --> 13:08.555
Well, at least it's not growing.

13:11.558 --> 13:13.861
Right?

13:19.933 --> 13:21.601
How long?

13:21.634 --> 13:23.904
Four minutes
and 30 seconds.

13:27.140 --> 13:29.176
How long do you wait?

13:29.209 --> 13:30.878
Five minutes.

13:30.911 --> 13:33.280
And if he doesn't
breathe after that?

13:33.313 --> 13:36.583
That would be
a strong indicator
of brain death.

13:39.052 --> 13:43.023
Jared, I just got off
the phone with Daddy,

13:43.056 --> 13:46.059
and he'll be here
really soon, okay?

13:47.660 --> 13:49.897
He'll be here
any minute.

13:49.897 --> 13:52.599
No excursions.
SATs are okay.

13:52.632 --> 13:55.435
No spontaneous breaths.

13:55.468 --> 13:58.906
No ocular vestibular response.

13:58.906 --> 14:00.540
MALIK:
That's five.

14:10.984 --> 14:13.253
That's it?

14:14.654 --> 14:16.456
I'm sorry.

14:16.489 --> 14:20.360
Jared can't breathe
without the ventilator.

14:20.393 --> 14:22.963
When you're ready,
we can talk about

14:22.996 --> 14:26.366
how long you want him
to be on the machines.

14:26.399 --> 14:28.535
No, my husband... Oh...

14:28.568 --> 14:30.170
( sobs )

14:34.707 --> 14:39.246
You have to give my husband
a chance to get here.

14:39.279 --> 14:42.182
We'll do everything that we can.

14:53.226 --> 14:55.395
Oh...

14:55.428 --> 14:57.297
He hates it when I leave.

14:57.330 --> 14:59.666
( sniffling )

14:59.699 --> 15:00.968
Stalls me

15:01.001 --> 15:03.570
with hugs and kisses.

15:03.603 --> 15:05.973
He was running out

15:06.006 --> 15:08.275
to give me another hug.

15:08.308 --> 15:10.543
CARTER:
You should really just go home.
There's nothing

15:10.577 --> 15:12.712
you can do here.
I don't want to go home.

15:12.745 --> 15:14.314
I don't want to stay here.
I want to talk to Abby.

15:14.347 --> 15:16.383
She's just a little
preoccupied right now.

15:16.416 --> 15:18.651
Her brother is missing.
There's not a lot that
she can do right now.

15:18.685 --> 15:20.420
Look, you have cops coming in
and out of here every day.

15:20.453 --> 15:22.489
She must know one of them.
We have to go down...

15:22.522 --> 15:25.358
The FAA has got the Coast
Guard searching on both
sides of the lake.

15:25.392 --> 15:27.360
I called the FAA.
I called the Coast Guard.

15:27.394 --> 15:28.695
They won't give me any
information over the phone.

15:28.728 --> 15:30.097
They think I'm a terrorist
or something.

15:30.130 --> 15:32.265
They keep referring me
to the Chicago PD.

15:32.299 --> 15:35.068
Okay, well, if it makes
you feel any better, I
know the desk sergeant.

15:35.102 --> 15:36.703
I can call him.
Yes, yes, John, thank you.

15:36.736 --> 15:39.072
But we have to go down there.
We have to push them.

15:39.106 --> 15:40.707
I know she's busy,
but we've got to do something.

15:40.740 --> 15:42.742
Okay, let me
go talk to her.
I want to talk to her.

15:42.775 --> 15:44.511
No, please, Maggie.
Just give me one minute.

15:44.544 --> 15:45.678
Look, I can
find her myself.
No, no...

15:45.712 --> 15:47.247
Please, we'll
deal with this.

15:47.280 --> 15:48.581
Just sit right here,
and give me a minute.

15:48.615 --> 15:50.150
John, we have
to find Eric.
I know.

15:50.183 --> 15:51.484
Is everything
all right?
No.

15:51.518 --> 15:53.053
I thought you
were off today.
I am.

15:53.086 --> 15:54.687
Hey, if Abby needs
to go, she should go.

15:54.721 --> 15:56.089
I was surprised
to see her.

15:56.123 --> 15:57.690
Yeah, I just need
to find her first.

15:57.724 --> 15:59.126
Trauma Two.

15:59.159 --> 16:00.127
Is Luka here yet?

16:00.160 --> 16:01.161
The Croat?

16:01.194 --> 16:02.695
Does he still
work here?

16:02.729 --> 16:03.763
I guess not.

16:03.796 --> 16:05.532
Dr. Weaver?
Yeah?

16:05.565 --> 16:07.534
There's a guy in Triage,
looks like a possible MVA.

16:07.567 --> 16:09.669
Think he matches
your mugger's description.

16:09.702 --> 16:11.738
All right, tell the nurses
to keep him busy.

16:11.771 --> 16:13.073
I'll be right there.

16:13.106 --> 16:14.607
LEWIS:
Hey, Gallant, bad news.

16:14.641 --> 16:17.544
Pathology lost
Mrs. Pinkus' pap smear.

16:17.577 --> 16:18.678
You need to swab her again,

16:18.711 --> 16:20.647
and stand by
while they examine it.

16:20.680 --> 16:22.215
What?
Just swab her again?

16:22.249 --> 16:23.616
Yeah, that bad, huh?

16:23.650 --> 16:25.552
Possible wrist fracture,
multiple abrasions.

16:25.585 --> 16:26.586
He said
he fell over a curb.

16:26.619 --> 16:27.787
That's him.

16:27.820 --> 16:29.689
Get security
and hard restraints.

16:29.722 --> 16:31.691
How about giving me
something for the pain?

16:31.724 --> 16:32.792
My freaking arm's broken.

16:32.825 --> 16:34.694
Where's my purse, creep?

16:34.727 --> 16:36.629
I don't know what
you're talking about, lady.

16:36.663 --> 16:37.630
Hey, get back

16:37.664 --> 16:38.665
into bed.

16:38.698 --> 16:39.599
You can't keep me here.

16:39.632 --> 16:40.567
Hey, man!
Hey.

16:40.600 --> 16:41.668
Get out of my way.

16:53.646 --> 16:54.714
Is she manic?

16:54.747 --> 16:55.782
She's upset.

16:55.815 --> 16:58.318
She's blond.

16:58.351 --> 16:59.552
So are you.

16:59.586 --> 17:03.256
Look, his plane
disappeared yesterday.

17:03.290 --> 17:05.157
She wouldn't
decompensate overnight.

17:05.192 --> 17:06.358
I've seen it happen.

17:06.393 --> 17:08.127
Well, then make
your own assessment.

17:08.161 --> 17:10.597
Can't you deal with her?

17:10.630 --> 17:12.799
She's not my mother.

17:12.832 --> 17:14.634
Who knows?
Maybe she can help...

17:14.666 --> 17:18.171
JANN:
What's wrong?
This machine is going off.

17:18.204 --> 17:19.839
Bradying down.
Are we treating?

17:19.872 --> 17:21.308
Yeah, till her husband
gets here.

17:21.340 --> 17:23.242
All right, mig of atropine.

17:23.276 --> 17:24.444
No pulse.

17:24.477 --> 17:26.579
Starting compressions.

17:26.613 --> 17:29.716
Mommy's here, Jared.

17:29.749 --> 17:31.384
Mommy's here.

17:31.418 --> 17:33.686
Oh, sweet boy.

17:33.720 --> 17:35.455
I've got you.

17:38.525 --> 17:40.260
Nothing?

17:40.293 --> 17:43.330
No change at all?

17:43.363 --> 17:46.299
Some cancers are more
resistant than others.

17:46.333 --> 17:50.703
Then why would the oncologist
put him through that?

17:50.737 --> 17:53.173
Well, he said 20%.

18:00.347 --> 18:03.250
Well, if you would give me

18:03.283 --> 18:06.653
the appropriate
IV antibiotics and oxygen

18:06.686 --> 18:09.189
and whatever
pain meds

18:09.222 --> 18:10.690
he needs to stay
comfortable,

18:10.723 --> 18:13.193
I would like to take him
home as soon as possible.

18:13.226 --> 18:14.694
My white count's up, Mom.

18:16.496 --> 18:19.199
I can beat the pneumonia.

18:19.232 --> 18:21.734
Sean...

18:21.768 --> 18:23.636
LEWIS:
You need
to think about

18:23.670 --> 18:25.572
how aggressively
you want to handle this.

18:25.605 --> 18:28.408
There's a good possibility you'd
be put on a breathing machine.

18:28.441 --> 18:30.443
Fine. Let's do it.

18:30.477 --> 18:34.347
And then what, hmm?

18:34.381 --> 18:36.716
More pain?

18:36.749 --> 18:38.451
More nausea?

18:38.485 --> 18:41.621
More infections,
vomiting?

18:45.625 --> 18:47.494
I can take it.

18:48.961 --> 18:51.364
I know you can.

18:51.398 --> 18:57.504
You have been... so brave

18:57.537 --> 19:02.709
and so strong.

19:02.742 --> 19:04.944
But do you want to spend
the rest of your time

19:04.977 --> 19:07.214
on machines
in a hospital?

19:10.450 --> 19:13.520
What choice do I have?

19:13.553 --> 19:16.556
MAN:
You are not going
to take any more.

19:16.589 --> 19:18.225
You're not going
to take any more.

19:18.225 --> 19:19.326
I only have
nine left.

19:19.359 --> 19:20.460
Nine what?
Toes!

19:20.493 --> 19:21.561
You already took
the big one.

19:21.594 --> 19:22.695
Relax,
I'll look at the...

19:22.729 --> 19:24.264
I'm not going
to relax.

19:24.297 --> 19:25.732
I'm not going
to relax.

19:25.765 --> 19:27.767
Kelly Graham, full-term,
vitals stable,

19:27.800 --> 19:29.702
contractions
three minutes apart.

19:29.736 --> 19:30.737
Just get it out.

19:30.770 --> 19:32.272
I want an epidural.

19:32.305 --> 19:33.406
You didn't give her
anything?

19:33.440 --> 19:34.241
She said no drugs.

19:34.274 --> 19:35.542
I changed my mind.

19:35.575 --> 19:36.876
I think I need to crash
at your place tonight.

19:36.909 --> 19:38.278
What?

19:38.311 --> 19:39.579
I took care
of the roach thing.

19:39.612 --> 19:40.880
Just need a few days
for it to air out.

19:40.913 --> 19:42.249
Uh, uh, no.

19:42.249 --> 19:43.650
What? You'd make me
get a hotel?

19:43.683 --> 19:44.717
I have a thing.

19:44.751 --> 19:45.718
What thing?

19:45.752 --> 19:46.653
A thing.

19:46.686 --> 19:47.720
Oh, more secrets.

19:47.754 --> 19:49.922
No, it's dinner with Susan.

19:49.956 --> 19:52.259
You know, she's been kind of
lonely and depressed lately.

19:52.259 --> 19:53.360
Oh, my God...

19:53.393 --> 19:54.861
Oh, she let loose
a geyser.

19:54.894 --> 19:55.895
Get him away from me.

19:55.928 --> 19:56.863
You know what?
I got this.

19:56.896 --> 19:58.265
You can go.

19:58.298 --> 19:59.899
All right, I guess
I'll see you then.

19:59.932 --> 20:01.501
Yeah, I'll see you.

20:01.534 --> 20:03.403
No, what are you doing?
Don't send him away.

20:03.436 --> 20:04.437
Who? Dr. Pratt?

20:04.471 --> 20:05.605
I love him.

20:05.638 --> 20:07.740
He thinks pregnant
women are sexy.

20:07.774 --> 20:09.342
Oh, ow!

20:09.376 --> 20:10.677
No, no, don't push!

20:10.710 --> 20:13.780
I have no control
over this thing.

20:13.813 --> 20:16.015
Mrs. Langston, do you
have any chest pain,

20:16.048 --> 20:17.684
any shortness
of breath?

20:17.717 --> 20:19.719
Comprend pas.

20:19.752 --> 20:21.788
Can she speak
English?

20:21.821 --> 20:23.623
She used
to speak it fluently.

20:23.656 --> 20:24.857
Since she was a teenager.

20:24.891 --> 20:25.825
Not anymore?

20:25.858 --> 20:27.327
The Alzheimer's

20:27.360 --> 20:29.662
started affecting her speech
a few months ago,

20:29.696 --> 20:31.498
but now she can only
speak French.

20:31.531 --> 20:32.932
Her first language?

20:32.965 --> 20:34.867
I never bothered
to learn.

20:34.901 --> 20:36.636
I never needed it.

20:38.438 --> 20:41.274
Je voudrais un
petit gout de melon.

20:44.076 --> 20:46.646
It means, "I would like
a taste of melon."

20:46.679 --> 20:49.616
It's the first full sentence
I learned in high school,

20:49.649 --> 20:51.518
and, uh, the only one
I remember.

20:51.551 --> 20:52.619
Poule au pot?

20:52.652 --> 20:54.621
Quoi?

20:54.654 --> 20:57.824
Uh, we'll try and find
a translator.

21:00.327 --> 21:01.361
Maxed out on atropine.

21:01.394 --> 21:02.595
Try another round of epi?

21:02.629 --> 21:03.596
( popping )
What was that?

21:03.630 --> 21:04.997
I may have broken a rib.

21:05.031 --> 21:06.032
V tach.

21:06.065 --> 21:07.700
Okay, charge to 100.

21:07.734 --> 21:09.369
We're going to have
to shock him.

21:09.402 --> 21:10.570
Will he feel that?

21:10.603 --> 21:11.771
You don't have
to be in here.

21:11.804 --> 21:13.072
I'm not leaving him.

21:13.105 --> 21:15.508
Okay, clear.

21:17.777 --> 21:19.045
Got a rhythm.

21:19.078 --> 21:20.713
Got a weak pulse.

21:20.747 --> 21:21.681
Is he alive?

21:21.714 --> 21:22.815
He has a pulse.

21:22.849 --> 21:24.517
Better mix up
some dopamine.

21:24.551 --> 21:26.052
Are you sure you want us
to do this?

21:26.085 --> 21:28.621
Quit asking me that.
He's my son.

21:33.626 --> 21:35.728
Abby, I'm flying
to Cleveland.

21:35.762 --> 21:38.598
I bought you a ticket
if you want to come.

21:38.631 --> 21:40.700
I talked to some
police sergeant.

21:40.733 --> 21:42.702
I used John's name, and he said

21:42.735 --> 21:44.704
that all search
and rescue operations

21:44.737 --> 21:47.374
for Lake Superior are
stationed out of, uh...

21:47.374 --> 21:51.378
out of the, um...
Cleveland District Command.

21:51.411 --> 21:52.044
Abby?

21:52.078 --> 21:53.480
( pounds door )

21:53.513 --> 21:56.449
I am not flying
to Cleveland, Maggie.

21:56.483 --> 21:58.751
Have you spoken
with anyone else?

21:58.785 --> 22:01.053
The FAA Chicago field rep

22:01.087 --> 22:02.855
told me he would
call me...

22:02.889 --> 22:06.626
The FAA is not going to tell you
anything until after the NTSB...

22:06.659 --> 22:08.628
I don't need them
to tell me anything.

22:08.661 --> 22:10.397
What? You don't care?

22:10.397 --> 22:11.664
Eric is dead.

22:12.565 --> 22:13.566
He is missing.

22:13.600 --> 22:15.468
He was trying to kill himself.

22:15.502 --> 22:16.836
No, no, he was not.

22:16.869 --> 22:18.638
He did not.

22:18.671 --> 22:20.640
He was in therapy.
He was on his meds.

22:20.673 --> 22:21.841
Really?
You sure about that?

22:21.874 --> 22:23.142
Yes, I'm sure about that.

22:23.175 --> 22:24.677
Did you watch him
every day, huh?

22:24.711 --> 22:25.678
Did you make sure
he was...

22:25.712 --> 22:26.846
He was not suicidal.

22:26.879 --> 22:28.648
I saw him.

22:28.681 --> 22:30.883
Two weeks ago,
he came to see me,

22:30.917 --> 22:32.151
and I didn't get it then,

22:32.184 --> 22:33.953
but now I understand
what it was.

22:33.986 --> 22:36.956
He was at peace
because he had a plan.

22:36.989 --> 22:40.493
No, no, he was doing well.
He was on schedule.

22:40.527 --> 22:41.994
Even showed me a picture
of the damn plane.

22:42.028 --> 22:44.096
Planes crash, Abby,
and people walk away.

22:44.130 --> 22:45.565
He came to say good-bye.

22:45.598 --> 22:47.600
People walk away, Abby!

22:47.634 --> 22:49.669
It was good-bye.

22:55.508 --> 22:57.544
( clears throat )

22:57.577 --> 22:59.779
You're in the wrong place
if you got a sore throat.

22:59.812 --> 23:01.781
I, uh, have
a specimen.

23:01.814 --> 23:03.550
Good for you.

23:03.583 --> 23:05.585
Put it with the rest.

23:05.618 --> 23:07.854
I was... I was told to
wait while you did it.

23:07.887 --> 23:09.889
You see this body here?

23:09.922 --> 23:12.792
I got three more just like it

23:12.825 --> 23:13.860
before you.

23:13.893 --> 23:15.595
Okay. I guess
I can, uh,

23:15.628 --> 23:17.664
leave it and
come back later.

23:17.697 --> 23:19.932
Like I said, put
it with the rest.

23:26.639 --> 23:28.040
( cup dropping )

23:28.074 --> 23:30.076
Sounds like you're going
to need another specimen.

23:30.109 --> 23:31.478
Uh, Dr. Upton?

23:31.511 --> 23:32.612
Just leave it.

23:32.645 --> 23:33.846
I'll get someone
to clean it up.

23:33.880 --> 23:34.947
Uh, Dr. Upton!

23:34.981 --> 23:38.518
Is that supposed
to happen?

23:38.551 --> 23:39.886
No.

23:39.919 --> 23:41.854
Well, don't just
stand there.

23:41.888 --> 23:45.725
Unzip it.

23:45.758 --> 23:48.528
HARMS:
Someone told him electrical
current neutralized snake venom.

23:48.561 --> 23:49.862
( laughs ):
Yeah, and kills you.

23:49.896 --> 23:50.997
Hey, again.

23:51.030 --> 23:54.501
Hey.

23:54.501 --> 23:56.503
I'm going to go
and restock the rig.

23:56.536 --> 23:58.671
Do you mean steal stuff?

23:59.939 --> 24:02.642
Uh...

24:02.675 --> 24:04.677
So, how's Mom?

24:04.711 --> 24:05.778
What?

24:05.812 --> 24:08.047
You know, the
lingerie labor.

24:08.080 --> 24:09.248
Oh.

24:09.281 --> 24:11.250
Big boy--
nine pounds, six ounces.

24:11.283 --> 24:13.252
Ooh, that's a keeper.

24:13.285 --> 24:16.523
And that's the most
important thing, isn't it?

24:16.523 --> 24:18.525
That she keeps it.

24:18.558 --> 24:19.859
What?

24:19.892 --> 24:20.893
Oh, you know,
you like kids.

24:20.927 --> 24:22.795
You-you like pregnant women.

24:22.829 --> 24:23.996
That's great.

24:24.030 --> 24:25.732
How about you just relax?

24:25.765 --> 24:27.800
I didn't expect you
to be a mom, that's all.

24:27.834 --> 24:28.968
I'm not a mom.

24:29.001 --> 24:30.537
I had a baby. That's all.

24:30.570 --> 24:31.938
Hey... I feel for you,

24:31.971 --> 24:35.542
but we all made mistakes
when we were young.

24:35.575 --> 24:37.777
Hmm. I wasn't a teenager, Greg.

24:37.810 --> 24:39.979
It was two years ago.

24:42.615 --> 24:43.783
Yo, got to roll.

24:43.816 --> 24:45.217
LOL slip and fall
on Dickerson.

24:45.251 --> 24:46.586
Yeah, in a sec.

24:46.619 --> 24:48.655
Jing-Mei?

24:48.688 --> 24:50.222
Listen, you feel
guilty about something,

24:50.256 --> 24:51.558
that's your thing.

24:51.558 --> 24:52.559
I don't care
either way.

24:52.592 --> 24:53.726
At least I know
how you feel.

24:53.760 --> 24:54.961
That's not
what I meant.

24:54.994 --> 24:56.295
LEWIS:
Hey, Pratt,
there's someone

24:56.328 --> 24:57.864
I want you to meet.

24:57.897 --> 24:59.766
Yeah. Not now.
In fact, you've met him before.

24:59.799 --> 25:01.267
Come here. You, too.

25:01.300 --> 25:03.302
Listen, I'm riding
with 37 today.

25:03.335 --> 25:04.604
We had a...

25:04.637 --> 25:05.672
BOTH:
slip and fall.

25:05.705 --> 25:06.973
Not anymore.

25:07.006 --> 25:08.775
You don't look lonely
and depressed to me.

25:08.808 --> 25:09.842
What?

25:09.876 --> 25:10.677
Nothing.

25:10.710 --> 25:11.744
MORALES:
Holy crap!

25:11.778 --> 25:12.779
You pronounced
this guy.

25:12.812 --> 25:13.880
GALLANT:
And he scared

25:13.913 --> 25:15.047
the hell out of me

25:15.081 --> 25:16.583
when he came
to in the morgue.

25:16.616 --> 25:18.217
His alcohol level was .322.

25:18.250 --> 25:19.952
His blood was
practically
antifreeze.

25:19.986 --> 25:21.721
Even the two of you should know

25:21.754 --> 25:24.591
you're not dead
until you're
warm and dead.

25:24.591 --> 25:25.592
Yeah, but he had lividity.

25:25.592 --> 25:26.626
We call that dirt.

25:26.659 --> 25:28.060
MRS. SIMMONS:
Excuse me?

25:28.094 --> 25:30.229
Dr. Lewis, could I speak
to you for a moment?

25:30.262 --> 25:31.931
Of course.

25:31.964 --> 25:33.299
Uh, this is Dr. Pratt.

25:33.332 --> 25:35.101
He's going to give you
a nice, warm bath.

25:35.134 --> 25:36.703
With bubbles?

25:36.736 --> 25:37.770
( laughs )

25:37.804 --> 25:39.672
Later, dude.

25:39.706 --> 25:40.740
Yeah.

25:40.773 --> 25:41.908
With bubbles.

25:41.941 --> 25:43.309
( laughing )

25:45.645 --> 25:47.814
I don't want Sean
to suffer anymore.

25:47.847 --> 25:51.283
I know it's grim right now,
but he seems

25:51.317 --> 25:53.753
pretty determined.

25:55.054 --> 25:56.923
Can you tell me
something different

25:56.956 --> 25:58.324
than all the oncologists?

25:58.357 --> 25:59.726
Every specialist?

25:59.759 --> 26:02.061
Because if you
can tell me

26:02.094 --> 26:04.631
that he has a chance...

26:07.399 --> 26:09.802
And it's Sean's decision.

26:09.836 --> 26:11.804
No.

26:11.838 --> 26:13.740
No.

26:13.773 --> 26:17.644
He didn't even want to do
the second round of chemo.

26:17.644 --> 26:19.646
But he did it for me.

26:19.646 --> 26:21.781
I made him.

26:21.814 --> 26:24.016
( sniffling )

26:24.050 --> 26:26.118
Do you have any
idea what it's like

26:26.152 --> 26:28.721
to watch someone you
love suffer like that

26:28.755 --> 26:30.890
just because
he loves you?

26:30.923 --> 26:32.158
Mrs. Simmons...

26:32.191 --> 26:34.661
He went through hell
to get to the point

26:34.694 --> 26:38.197
where he... and
I finally accepted

26:38.230 --> 26:40.867
that he was
going to die.

26:40.900 --> 26:42.835
And then he met you.

26:42.869 --> 26:46.238
He likes you...

26:46.272 --> 26:48.274
as a doctor
and as a woman.

26:48.307 --> 26:49.408
( sniffles )

26:49.441 --> 26:50.910
And without
meaning to or not

26:50.943 --> 26:53.780
you're giving him false hope.

26:55.882 --> 26:57.950
I just want Sean
to come home.

26:57.984 --> 26:59.151
( sniffles )

26:59.185 --> 27:00.720
He'll listen to you

27:00.753 --> 27:04.123
if you tell him
that's what's best.

27:19.772 --> 27:21.874
Mr. Kroll.

27:27.113 --> 27:29.015
I'm very sorry,

27:29.048 --> 27:32.151
but your son has suffered
a severe head injury.

27:33.119 --> 27:35.121
What are you saying?

27:35.154 --> 27:38.758
He shows no sign of
any brain activity.

27:39.926 --> 27:41.861
The machines are
breathing for him.

27:41.894 --> 27:43.963
And we've been keeping
his body alive

27:43.996 --> 27:46.065
until you got here.

27:46.098 --> 27:48.300
JANA:
I didn't...

27:48.334 --> 27:51.871
I didn't see him, Michael.

27:51.904 --> 27:53.840
I didn't see him.

27:53.873 --> 27:56.208
Okay.

27:56.242 --> 27:58.344
There must be some kind of hope.

27:59.912 --> 28:01.748
I know that you need
to believe that,

28:01.781 --> 28:03.950
but you have to understand
your son is gone.

28:03.983 --> 28:07.353
He died.

28:09.121 --> 28:11.490
Multifocal PVC's on lidocaine.

28:11.523 --> 28:13.425
What does that mean?

28:13.459 --> 28:16.963
CARTER:
He'll soon fall back
into cardiac arrest,

28:16.996 --> 28:20.266
and we might be able
to stop that temporarily,

28:20.299 --> 28:22.301
but not
indefinitely.

28:22.334 --> 28:24.370
MARTIN:
I need to see him again.

28:24.403 --> 28:25.504
Can I see him?

28:25.537 --> 28:27.874
Of course.

28:33.813 --> 28:35.782
I don't know how you work here.

28:35.782 --> 28:37.383
Look, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean...

28:37.416 --> 28:40.887
Abby, don't say anything.

28:40.920 --> 28:42.789
I thought I could control him.

28:42.822 --> 28:45.925
I thought I was,
and maybe I was blind or
stupid,

28:45.958 --> 28:47.794
or refused to see the signs,

28:47.827 --> 28:50.830
or maybe I'm just nuts.

28:53.065 --> 28:55.067
But I'm not ready to bury him.

28:55.101 --> 28:58.270
The last time
I saw my son,

28:58.304 --> 29:00.372
he was alive,
and that's my reality

29:00.406 --> 29:02.241
until someone proves otherwise.

29:02.274 --> 29:04.811
He is alive.

29:04.811 --> 29:07.213
Will the El take
me to Midway?

29:07.246 --> 29:08.447
Mom...

29:08.480 --> 29:10.516
Will the El take me
to Midway?

29:12.584 --> 29:14.520
Eastbound track.

29:16.222 --> 29:19.826
I'll call you from Cleveland.

29:23.362 --> 29:25.832
Where's your mom?

29:25.865 --> 29:30.169
Uh, she's out getting stuff
from the nurse to take home.

29:33.205 --> 29:35.942
You don't have to put yourself

29:35.975 --> 29:37.009
through this, Sean.

29:37.043 --> 29:38.911
Not for her.

29:39.912 --> 29:43.182
What about me?

29:43.215 --> 29:45.217
The most you'll get will
be a couple of months.

29:45.251 --> 29:46.853
It's not a cure.

29:48.220 --> 29:50.556
My mom wants you to talk me

29:50.589 --> 29:53.926
into going home with her,
doesn't she?

29:53.960 --> 29:56.028
Hmm?

30:08.307 --> 30:10.843
What would you do?

30:12.879 --> 30:14.881
Uh...

30:14.914 --> 30:17.283
I can't answer that.

30:25.391 --> 30:27.593
I don't want to die.

30:34.166 --> 30:36.335
Then you should fight.

30:36.368 --> 30:39.972
With everything you have.

30:43.943 --> 30:47.079
( sighs )

30:47.113 --> 30:48.280
FRANK:
Damn.

30:48.314 --> 30:49.648
KOVAC:
What?

30:49.681 --> 30:51.183
Looks like I just lost 50 bucks.

30:51.217 --> 30:52.251
You shouldn't gamble.

30:52.284 --> 30:53.552
Hey, Frank, where's Weaver?

30:53.585 --> 30:55.621
She's at Personnel,
looking for new docs.

30:55.654 --> 30:56.989
You, uh... you
still work here?

30:57.023 --> 30:58.090
I think so.

30:58.124 --> 30:59.458
Seizing teenager
in Triage.

30:59.491 --> 31:01.260
Drug user?
Yup. Coming off
a meth high.

31:01.293 --> 31:03.595
Just started...
tonoclonic activity.

31:05.397 --> 31:06.933
How long?

31:06.933 --> 31:08.134
Maybe two minutes.

31:08.167 --> 31:09.335
Did you give him anything?

31:09.368 --> 31:11.303
I pushed four of Ativan.

31:11.337 --> 31:12.972
Uh, recheck a temp.
He's burning up.

31:13.005 --> 31:14.673
Amphetamines can
raise body temperature.

31:14.706 --> 31:16.375
The high fever makes you seize.

31:16.408 --> 31:17.443
( beeping )

31:17.476 --> 31:18.377
GALLANT:
Oh, man.

31:18.410 --> 31:20.046
It's 107.3.

31:20.079 --> 31:22.081
MARQUEZ:
We need to keep him
on the monitors.

31:22.114 --> 31:24.150
Grab four liters
of irrigation.

31:24.183 --> 31:25.451
We need to get

31:25.484 --> 31:26.685
his temperature down now.

31:26.718 --> 31:28.054
What about ice packs
to the axilla?

31:28.087 --> 31:29.221
That won't work.

31:29.255 --> 31:30.589
Then start a cold
gastric lavage.

31:30.622 --> 31:31.590
We don't have time.

31:31.623 --> 31:32.658
Give me the saline.

31:32.691 --> 31:33.960
He needs to be wet

31:33.960 --> 31:35.694
to increase the heat transfer.

31:35.727 --> 31:36.963
He's seizing again.

31:36.963 --> 31:38.530
No. He's just shivering.

31:42.201 --> 31:43.335
V fib.

31:43.369 --> 31:44.536
What's that?

31:44.570 --> 31:46.005
It's an unstable
heartbeat.

31:46.038 --> 31:47.573
What will that do to him?

31:47.606 --> 31:52.211
His heart isn't pumping enough
oxygen through his body,

31:52.244 --> 31:54.446
and in a minute, it'll stop.

31:54.480 --> 31:57.416
And that's
when you would shock him?

31:57.449 --> 31:58.985
Mm-hmm.

32:00.652 --> 32:04.423
( stifling sobs )

32:09.228 --> 32:11.363
( stifling sobs )

32:16.735 --> 32:19.538
I love you, baby.

32:19.571 --> 32:23.375
I love you,
sweetie, so much.

32:23.409 --> 32:25.611
( phone ringing )

32:31.650 --> 32:33.219
( phone continues ringing )

32:33.252 --> 32:34.753
Hello.

32:34.786 --> 32:37.223
Yeah, this is she.

32:42.361 --> 32:45.497
Uh, was it...

32:45.531 --> 32:47.666
damaged?

32:49.768 --> 32:52.204
( monitor beeping )

32:55.574 --> 32:58.044
Well, then, where's my brother?

33:00.446 --> 33:03.449
Did he leave a-a bag
or a note or-or...?

33:04.416 --> 33:06.418
Is it?

33:06.452 --> 33:07.686
Well, do you think...

33:07.719 --> 33:10.056
Do you think
you could leave it there

33:10.056 --> 33:11.390
so if he comes...?

33:11.423 --> 33:12.591
No. Okay.
They found
his plane?

33:12.624 --> 33:14.760
Uh, what's the name of the town?

33:14.793 --> 33:16.628
Thank you.

33:16.662 --> 33:17.629
Intact.
Intact?

33:17.663 --> 33:19.365
Yeah. Tied down in a field

33:19.398 --> 33:22.401
outside of-of Sault Saint Marie.

33:22.434 --> 33:24.536
He's alive.

33:24.570 --> 33:26.472
And he cared enough
to tie down his plane.

33:26.505 --> 33:27.573
Yeah.

33:27.606 --> 33:29.141
Guess Maggie was right.

33:30.642 --> 33:33.079
God, I'll be right back.

34:02.674 --> 34:05.611
Mom!

34:05.644 --> 34:07.613
Mom!

34:07.646 --> 34:09.715
Mom!

34:14.453 --> 34:16.255
What the hell are
you doing, Luka?!

34:16.288 --> 34:17.456
He was cooking his brain.

34:17.489 --> 34:19.158
He needs to be
on a monitor!

34:19.190 --> 34:21.527
Ice immersion can cause an
arrhythmia or a heart attack!

34:21.560 --> 34:22.694
Not in a young,

34:22.728 --> 34:23.629
healthy patient.

34:23.661 --> 34:24.696
He'll get frostbite.

34:24.730 --> 34:26.197
He won't be out here that long.

34:26.232 --> 34:27.666
Temp's down to 104.

34:27.699 --> 34:29.268
Okay, that's good.
Let's put him on a gurney.

34:29.301 --> 34:31.437
I just saved
his brain,

34:31.469 --> 34:33.272
heart, kidneys,
and liver.

34:33.304 --> 34:35.806
Yeah, well, I guess
it's a good thing

34:35.841 --> 34:38.143
you decided
to finally come in.

34:38.177 --> 34:39.344
Where is it?
I don't see it.

34:39.378 --> 34:41.213
A little further north,
like Canada?

34:41.246 --> 34:42.547
No. Michigan, I think.

34:42.581 --> 34:45.351
Oh, wait, here it is--
Sault Saint Marie.

34:45.384 --> 34:48.219
Michigan, yes,
you're right, Michigan.

34:48.254 --> 34:50.656
You know, you were right.

34:50.688 --> 34:52.491
About what?

34:52.524 --> 34:54.893
He's okay.

34:54.926 --> 34:58.364
Yes, but you could've
just as easily gotten

34:58.397 --> 35:00.166
the other phone call...

35:00.166 --> 35:02.268
and in his mind, it
wouldn't have been selfish.

35:02.301 --> 35:04.570
It would have been a
whole lot of other things.

35:04.603 --> 35:06.205
He doesn't want
to be a burden.

35:06.238 --> 35:07.439
He's not.

35:07.473 --> 35:09.341
Well, we have to
make sure he knows

35:09.375 --> 35:10.509
that he's not.

35:10.542 --> 35:12.344
He's canceled
his cell phone,

35:12.378 --> 35:13.879
but he still has
his e-mail address.

35:13.912 --> 35:16.248
Don't you think
we could send him
a message?

35:16.282 --> 35:18.884
I think if he wants to get
in touch with us, he will.

35:18.917 --> 35:20.452
Abby, I have
a little money.

35:20.486 --> 35:22.188
You and I could go up
there and look for him,

35:22.221 --> 35:24.356
or I could hire
a private investigator.

35:24.390 --> 35:27.226
No.

35:27.259 --> 35:30.296
We don't get
to do anything.

35:30.329 --> 35:32.398
We just have to wait.

35:32.431 --> 35:33.799
( sighs )

35:35.767 --> 35:38.370
He's my son.
How can I wait?

35:40.839 --> 35:43.342
It's really hard,

35:43.375 --> 35:46.312
but you just have to...

35:46.345 --> 35:48.680
go about your life,
and do everyday things.

35:48.714 --> 35:51.650
Go to work, do your laundry,
clean the house.

35:51.683 --> 35:54.653
You know, just try
to keep your mind off

35:54.686 --> 35:57.689
all the horrible things that
might be happening to him,

35:57.723 --> 35:59.458
and... and you do that...

35:59.491 --> 36:01.360
for a week, or a month,

36:01.393 --> 36:04.696
or maybe... a year.

36:04.730 --> 36:07.799
And then someday
he'll show up,

36:07.833 --> 36:10.469
and we'll drop everything
and go to him.

36:13.004 --> 36:15.774
Or we get
the other phone call.

36:19.311 --> 36:20.446
( sighs )

36:20.479 --> 36:25.284
Welcome to the outside
of the disease.

36:25.317 --> 36:27.286
Sure looks good
for a corpse.

36:27.319 --> 36:29.588
You heard?
( chuckles ):
Yeah.

36:29.621 --> 36:32.258
Look, I'm sor...
Hey, listen,
I wanted to say...

36:32.258 --> 36:33.292
No, go ahead.

36:33.325 --> 36:34.726
No, no, you go.

36:34.760 --> 36:36.495
Well, um, before...

36:36.528 --> 36:39.431
you know, maybe
you were right.

36:39.465 --> 36:43.302
Maybe I was a
little judgmental.

36:43.335 --> 36:45.771
That's good to know.

36:45.804 --> 36:49.641
Look-- I feel like people
are judging me all the time,

36:49.675 --> 36:51.343
and I hate it.

36:51.377 --> 36:54.313
So, if I did that to you,
then I'm... sorry.

36:54.346 --> 36:59.818
Especially because I like
you and respect you.

36:59.851 --> 37:02.988
I mean, what the hell
do I know anyway?

37:03.021 --> 37:05.724
You sure don't know
how to apologize.

37:05.757 --> 37:07.526
( laughs ):
No, I don't.

37:07.559 --> 37:09.461
( chuckling )

37:09.495 --> 37:12.798
So, what were
you going to say?

37:12.831 --> 37:14.633
You want to see
a picture of him?

37:14.666 --> 37:16.668
Yeah.

37:16.702 --> 37:18.337
( sighs )

37:18.370 --> 37:21.039
You know, I get these letters
from his adoptive parents,

37:21.072 --> 37:23.008
and I look forward
to getting them,

37:23.041 --> 37:24.943
but I also don't.

37:24.976 --> 37:27.479
His name's Michael.

37:27.513 --> 37:28.880
( chuckles )

37:28.914 --> 37:30.382
He's black.
Half.

37:30.416 --> 37:31.650
( chuckles )

37:31.683 --> 37:34.486
Okay, okay,
Asian-African-American.

37:34.520 --> 37:35.987
It's a great combination.

37:36.021 --> 37:37.323
He's beautiful.

37:37.323 --> 37:39.858
Thank you.
You almost
ready?

37:39.891 --> 37:41.560
Uh, yeah.

37:41.593 --> 37:43.762
Just give me ten minutes.
I'll be right there.

37:43.795 --> 37:47.566
Night, Dr. Chen.

37:47.599 --> 37:50.969
You told me you were going
out with Lewis tonight.

37:51.002 --> 37:51.937
Uh, yeah.

37:51.970 --> 37:53.339
Jing-Mei, come on.

37:53.372 --> 37:56.342
I'm just taking
the paramedics out.

37:56.375 --> 37:58.844
I told Harms and Morales
that I'd buy them dinner.

37:58.877 --> 37:59.978
I only see Harms.

38:00.011 --> 38:02.381
Why don't you
come with us?

38:02.414 --> 38:05.651
I don't think so,
but, uh, have fun.

38:08.019 --> 38:10.088
Ugh!

38:10.121 --> 38:11.457
What's wrong?

38:11.490 --> 38:12.524
Pratt.

38:12.558 --> 38:13.992
What'd he do?

38:14.025 --> 38:15.661
He has a date.

38:15.694 --> 38:16.628
No.

38:16.662 --> 38:17.696
Yeah, with Harms.

38:17.729 --> 38:19.064
The paramedic?

38:19.097 --> 38:22.368
( sighs ):
It's my own fault.

38:22.401 --> 38:23.902
You're forgetting
the #1 rule of dating:

38:23.935 --> 38:24.903
men are scum.

38:24.936 --> 38:25.904
And women don't know

38:25.937 --> 38:27.072
what the hell they want.

38:27.105 --> 38:28.874
Am I right?
I'm right, right?

38:28.907 --> 38:31.076
They all want a commitment
till you give it to 'em,

38:31.109 --> 38:32.378
then they want
their freedom.

38:32.378 --> 38:33.979
So, naturally,
you oblige.

38:34.012 --> 38:35.547
Then, they accuse you
of trying to be
with somebody else.

38:35.581 --> 38:36.782
I'm telling you,
you can't win.

38:36.815 --> 38:38.016
Women can be hard
to figure out sometimes.

38:38.049 --> 38:39.818
Sometimes?

38:39.851 --> 38:41.553
Nah, you know who's got it
all figured out, I think?

38:41.587 --> 38:42.854
Homosexuals.

38:42.888 --> 38:44.656
No, I'm serious.
Just listen to me.

38:44.690 --> 38:46.625
Look, there's two
guys living together.

38:46.658 --> 38:48.927
Toilet seat's always up.
Channel's always on ESPN.

38:48.960 --> 38:50.729
You can drink beers in bed,
leave clothes on the floor.

38:50.762 --> 38:52.931
I'm telling you--
gay cats got it good.

38:52.964 --> 38:53.999
Why are you
telling me this?

38:54.032 --> 38:56.067
I have no idea.

38:57.536 --> 38:58.470
I thought you were on vacation.

38:58.504 --> 39:00.439
I thought you quit.

39:00.472 --> 39:02.574
Can you take hives in Four?
Bad seaweed wrap.
I'm not on.

39:02.608 --> 39:04.476
Just one more
patient.
I was never on.

39:04.510 --> 39:05.811
What are you
doing here?
I have no idea.

39:05.844 --> 39:06.945
John, did you
call Trauma two?

39:06.978 --> 39:08.480
Yeah, Transpo's
moving him now.

39:08.514 --> 39:10.115
Grief counselors
are in with the parents.

39:10.148 --> 39:11.650
Did you want to stay
and work a swing?

39:11.683 --> 39:12.884
( laughs ):
Not a chance.

39:12.918 --> 39:14.520
You already missed
half your shift.

39:14.553 --> 39:15.987
I told you
I had things to do.

39:16.021 --> 39:18.457
Well, good, you
can work a double.
Whatever.

39:18.490 --> 39:20.125
Ward's full.
You better get started.

39:20.158 --> 39:21.427
I did start.
Good.

39:21.460 --> 39:23.562
Hey, the prodigal
doctor returns.

39:23.595 --> 39:26.097
Why is there a Sumo
wrestler in One?

39:26.131 --> 39:28.099
See? Like you never left.

39:30.736 --> 39:32.671
Takeout should be
here any minute now.

39:32.704 --> 39:34.105
Okay.

39:34.139 --> 39:36.475
Hey.

39:36.508 --> 39:37.443
What you reading?

39:37.443 --> 39:39.845
Uh, Mansfield Park.

39:39.878 --> 39:42.781
For like,
the 45th time?

39:42.814 --> 39:45.150
No, it's just
the third time.

39:45.183 --> 39:48.454
Why read, man,
when you got TV?

39:49.688 --> 39:51.657
Ahh...

39:55.594 --> 39:59.831
You know, I don't, uh...

40:02.067 --> 40:03.535
I don't want to wait.

40:03.569 --> 40:05.804
I, I think that
we should try again.

40:09.475 --> 40:12.110
You feel like there's
something missing
here, Kerry?

40:12.143 --> 40:13.945
( chuckles ):
Yes... yes.

40:16.081 --> 40:19.150
Okay, well, are you
sure you're ready?

40:19.184 --> 40:24.022
I was thinking
that it should be...

40:24.055 --> 40:25.524
( sighs )

40:25.557 --> 40:29.561
I was thinking that it
should be you this time.

40:29.595 --> 40:32.130
Me?

40:32.163 --> 40:34.232
Kerry, honey, listen.

40:34.265 --> 40:38.003
You know what I do.
I'm the roofman.

40:38.036 --> 40:39.204
I can't swing a Halligan

40:39.237 --> 40:41.239
when I'm six months
pregnant.

40:41.272 --> 40:42.874
You could take a leave.
I mean, you're younger.

40:42.908 --> 40:44.476
You'd have a better chance.

40:44.510 --> 40:47.546
Listen, I know I'm
supposed to feel

40:47.579 --> 40:51.082
like I want to carry
a baby, but I don't.

40:51.116 --> 40:54.520
Once that baby's
inside of you, it's...

40:54.553 --> 40:56.154
I mean, it's incredible.

40:56.187 --> 40:57.723
I mean, it's, it's...

40:57.756 --> 40:58.890
Kerry,
I don't want it.
It's...

40:58.924 --> 41:00.626
I don't want it.

41:00.659 --> 41:03.929
And I know that makes
you feel like I'm not a...

41:03.962 --> 41:06.532
a total woman
or something, but...
No, it doesn't.

41:06.565 --> 41:10.235
It doesn't...
doesn't make me feel that.

41:10.268 --> 41:12.203
( sighs )

41:14.606 --> 41:15.774
Babe, listen to me...

41:15.807 --> 41:16.875
listen.

41:18.610 --> 41:22.080
We're being
totally honest here.

41:22.113 --> 41:24.049
I can't.

41:24.082 --> 41:27.118
I'm sorry,
but I, I can't.

41:29.187 --> 41:31.289
Not even for me?
Come on...

41:31.322 --> 41:33.158
Don't do that.

41:33.191 --> 41:36.227
Come on.
That's not fair.

41:36.261 --> 41:41.132
Well, none of this
is fair, Sandy.

41:42.934 --> 41:44.670
None of it's fair.

41:48.640 --> 41:50.576
Call the takeout guy.

41:50.576 --> 41:53.579
Should've been here by now.

41:53.612 --> 41:55.581
( sighs )

42:00.752 --> 42:02.187
Hey.

42:06.091 --> 42:07.893
Don't put it out on my account.

42:07.926 --> 42:10.195
I only wanted half.

42:10.228 --> 42:13.599
Nobody smokes
half a cigarette.

42:13.632 --> 42:16.668
I do. And I'm trying
to quit.

42:16.702 --> 42:18.870
Oh, back to that, are we?

42:18.904 --> 42:20.639
I like routine.

42:20.672 --> 42:22.273
Yeah...

42:22.307 --> 42:24.175
like disappearing on me.

42:24.209 --> 42:27.212
I know. I'm sorry.

42:27.245 --> 42:29.214
It's no problem.

42:29.247 --> 42:32.117
You had bigger concerns.

42:32.150 --> 42:34.285
Yeah, like ruining
your vacation.

42:34.319 --> 42:37.623
Who knows? You might've saved me
from a shark attack.

42:39.390 --> 42:42.260
Run away, Carter.

42:42.293 --> 42:45.263
Run as fast as you can.

42:45.296 --> 42:46.364
( sighs )

42:46.397 --> 42:48.299
Where's Maggie?

42:48.333 --> 42:50.135
She went home.

42:50.168 --> 42:51.302
Minnesota?

42:51.336 --> 42:53.338
Please.

42:53.371 --> 42:56.908
Well, you want to hide out
at my place for a while?

42:56.942 --> 43:01.747
Did you hear what I said
about running away?

43:01.780 --> 43:04.149
I block out about half
of what you say.

43:04.182 --> 43:06.918
Only half?

43:06.952 --> 43:09.154
Negative half.

43:14.760 --> 43:16.227
I'm sorry.

43:16.261 --> 43:18.964
No. You're right.

43:18.997 --> 43:20.932
I am negative.

43:20.966 --> 43:22.233
It's hard not to be

43:22.267 --> 43:24.069
when you attract misery
everywhere you go.

43:24.102 --> 43:25.737
I'm not going
to let you do this.

43:25.771 --> 43:27.138
I'm like a magnet
for it.

43:27.172 --> 43:29.741
And you shouldn't have
to deal with this.

43:29.775 --> 43:31.276
Now you're pissing me off.

43:31.309 --> 43:32.811
Maybe you should just
cut your losses.

43:32.844 --> 43:34.212
You know, Eric is alive.

43:34.245 --> 43:36.147
You could take two seconds
and rejoice in that.

43:36.181 --> 43:37.983
I did.

43:38.016 --> 43:40.986
I hugged you, and then I ran
away to find my crazy mother,

43:41.019 --> 43:43.154
and I never even came
back to thank you.

43:43.188 --> 43:45.023
Thank you for
traveling all night.

43:45.056 --> 43:47.893
Thank you for working all
day just to be with me.

43:47.926 --> 43:49.260
You're welcome.

43:49.294 --> 43:51.930
'Cause, you know,
my life is on hold.

43:51.963 --> 43:54.299
It will always
and forever be on hold.

43:54.332 --> 43:55.867
You don't want
to be on hold.

43:55.901 --> 43:57.068
Then don't put it on hold.

43:57.102 --> 43:58.269
I have no choice. You do.

43:58.303 --> 44:00.038
Right, your life sucks,
now and forever.

44:00.071 --> 44:01.272
There's nobody
that you can love.

44:01.306 --> 44:02.708
There's nothing you
can do about it...

44:02.708 --> 44:03.709
You don't want me to love you.

44:03.742 --> 44:05.243
Can I decide that for myself?!

44:05.276 --> 44:06.878
Fine, decide.
What do you want?
What do I want?!

44:06.912 --> 44:08.714
I want you to stop
being so afraid,

44:08.747 --> 44:10.716
I'm not afraid...
I want us to stop
being so careful,

44:10.749 --> 44:12.350
I want to marry you!

44:12.383 --> 44:13.885
( helicopter approaching )
What?

44:13.919 --> 44:16.021
I want to marry you!

44:16.054 --> 44:18.156
Oh, you're proposing?

44:18.189 --> 44:19.124
Yeah!

44:19.157 --> 44:20.325
You're crazy!

44:20.358 --> 44:22.260
Well, then I'll fit right in!
