05:58.900 --> 06:00.700
GOING BACK TO THE CASTLE WHICH

06:00.767 --> 06:02.500
WAS THE OLD NIGHT CLUB IN TOWN,

06:02.567 --> 06:03.400
LIKE PEOPLE WOULD DRIVE BY,

06:03.467 --> 06:04.500
THROW THINGS AT US, LIKE WHILE

06:16.033 --> 06:16.867
PRESENT MYSELF IN THE WAY THAT I

REALLY WANT TO BECAUSE I JUST

06:17.667 --> 06:18.266
DON'T WANT PEOPLE TO LIKE STARE

MALE.

06:24.934 --> 06:27.834
YEAH.

06:27.900 --> 06:28.433
>> THAT'S

06:28.500 --> 06:29.567
UNDERSTANDABLE.

06:29.633 --> 06:30.367
I THINK THERE'S A GRAY AREA, I

06:30.433 --> 06:31.800
LIVE IN IT.

06:31.867 --> 06:32.900
I, I'M GENDER NEUTRAL, GENDER

06:39.767 --> 06:41.734
SO TRUST, I KNOW THE STRUGGLE OF

06:41.800 --> 06:43.100
LIKE THE ROLLER COASTER THAT

06:43.166 --> 06:44.066
GENDER CAN BE AS LIKE A QUEER

SIDES TO ME, I HAVE A REALLY

06:50.367 --> 06:52.000
CONFIDENT BITCHY DIVA QUEEN SIDE

06:52.066 --> 06:54.700
AND THEN I HAVE LIKE CRIPPLING

06:54.767 --> 06:56.200
SELF-DOUBT AND IT'S ALWAYS A

06:56.266 --> 06:57.600
STRUGGLE BETWEEN THE TWO.

06:57.667 --> 06:58.934
>> I UNDERSTAND THAT.

06:59.000 --> 07:00.300
I MEAN ESPECIALLY IN THIS AREA.

07:00.367 --> 07:01.233
>> YEP.

07:01.300 --> 07:01.800
>> IT'S HARD IN THE

07:01.867 --> 07:02.133
BIBLE BELT.

07:02.200 --> 07:04.367
>> YES, IT IS.

07:04.433 --> 07:05.633
>> YOU KNOW, YOU ALREADY

07:05.700 --> 07:06.633
LIKE EXPRESS YOURSELF LIKE WITH

07:06.700 --> 07:07.433
THE EARRINGS AND THE HAIR AND

07:07.500 --> 07:08.567
YOU KNOW YOU'RE ALMOST THERE BUT

07:08.633 --> 07:10.100
IT'S LIKE IF YOU HAVE MORE TO

07:10.166 --> 07:11.533
SHOW, LIKE YOU'RE KIND OF LIKE

07:11.600 --> 07:12.967
SHORT CHANGING YOURSELF AND THE

07:13.033 --> 07:14.100
WORLD IF YOU DON'T LET THEM SEE

07:14.166 --> 07:17.300
IT.

07:17.367 --> 07:17.734
YOU HAVE TO LET THAT

07:17.800 --> 07:18.033
ENERGY OUT.

07:18.100 --> 07:19.000
>> YOU HAVE TO.

07:19.066 --> 07:19.800
>> YOU KNOW AND THAT'S

07:19.867 --> 07:21.000
KIND OF WHAT DRAG DOES TOO I

07:21.066 --> 07:22.066
THINK IN A WAY LIKE WITH YOUR,

07:22.133 --> 07:23.400
LIKE THIS FEMININE LIKE PERSONA

07:23.467 --> 07:24.667
THAT YOU HAVE INSIDE IS JUST A

07:24.734 --> 07:25.467
WAY TO LIKE LET THAT ENERGY OUT.

07:25.533 --> 07:27.567
>> YES.

07:27.633 --> 07:29.200
>> THERE'S A LOT OF

07:29.266 --> 07:29.800
DIFFICULTIES WHEN IT COMES TO

07:29.867 --> 07:31.333
GENDER IDENTITY FOR NOAH.

07:31.400 --> 07:33.200
NOAH IS AFRAID FOR THE WORLD TO

07:33.266 --> 07:34.367
SEE HIM IN THIS QUEER FEMININE

07:34.433 --> 07:36.767
SIDE OF THEMSELVES.

07:36.834 --> 07:38.233
I CAN RELATE WITH THAT, I THINK

07:38.300 --> 07:40.233
ANY QUEER PERSON CAN, I THINK

07:40.300 --> 07:42.133
WE'RE RAISED TO THINK THAT WHO

07:42.200 --> 07:45.867
WE ARE IS WRONG.

07:45.934 --> 07:47.000
IT GETS EXHAUSTING TO

07:47.066 --> 07:48.667
FEEL LIKE SHIT ABOUT YOURSELF.

07:48.734 --> 07:50.066
>> I THINK IT'LL HELP ME

07:50.133 --> 07:51.400
WITH THE BATTLE OF TRYING TO GET

07:51.467 --> 07:53.567
RID OF THAT PERSONA THAT'S SO

07:53.633 --> 07:55.600
CRITICAL IN MY EAR.

07:55.667 --> 07:56.867
>> THE EASY PART IS LIKE

07:56.934 --> 07:58.266
THE CREATIVE STUFF AND THE

07:58.333 --> 07:59.367
EXCITEMENT ABOUT WANTING TO DO

07:59.433 --> 08:01.166
DRAG 'CAUSE IT'S FUN BUT THE

08:01.233 --> 08:02.900
HARD PART ABOUT DRAG IS THAT IT

08:02.967 --> 08:04.500
WILL TAKE YOU ON AN EMOTIONAL

08:04.567 --> 08:05.266
JOURNEY WEIRDLY, ESPECIALLY THIS

08:05.333 --> 08:10.266
EXPERIENCE.

08:10.333 --> 08:11.767
I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR NOAH

08:11.834 --> 08:13.166

FIND OUT THAT HE WAS GAY AND UM,

55:30.500 --> 55:33.333
I THINK I WAS THE LAST ONE

55:33.400 --> 55:35.967

55:36.033 --> 55:38.967
WASN'T GONNA ACCEPT HIM.
