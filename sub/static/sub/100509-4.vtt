WEBVTT

00:15.932 --> 00:17.142
[narrator] <i>Reunited!</i>

00:17.559 --> 00:19.269
<i>With the help of the Bad Batch,</i>

00:19.352 --> 00:22.647
<i>Captain Rex rescues his old friend,</i>
<i>ARC Trooper Echo,</i>

00:22.731 --> 00:24.274
<i>from the Techno Union.</i>

00:24.357 --> 00:27.235
<i>The Separatist loss</i>
<i>of Echo's strategic algorithm</i>

00:27.318 --> 00:31.614
<i>provides a chance for the Republic</i>
<i>to turn the tide in the battle for Anaxes.</i>

00:31.698 --> 00:35.493
<i>However, Echo's horrifying experience</i>
<i>behind enemy lines</i>

00:35.577 --> 00:40.915
<i>leaves lingering questions</i>
<i>of his true loyalty and uncertain future.</i>

00:54.554 --> 00:57.307
We have more than a dozen
active battlefronts on Anaxes,

00:57.390 --> 00:59.601
and we are losing nearly every one.

01:00.310 --> 01:03.480
But if Admiral Trench
can no longer anticipate our moves,

01:03.563 --> 01:06.191
we now have the opportunity
to retake the planet.

01:06.691 --> 01:08.735
I can improve your chances.

01:11.196 --> 01:13.365
Eh, excuse me, Generals.

01:15.742 --> 01:20.080
Echo, I'm sorry, but I just don't think
you're ready for battle yet.

01:20.163 --> 01:21.873
I am not a liability, Rex.

01:22.374 --> 01:25.377
I'm the best chance we have
to take back Anaxes.

01:27.337 --> 01:30.507
If the trooper has a plan,
I'd like to hear it.

01:31.299 --> 01:32.300
May I?

01:40.433 --> 01:44.062
While Master Windu leads a team
to retake the assembly complex,

01:44.145 --> 01:47.649
the Bad Batch will escort me
into Trench's new comm vault,

01:47.732 --> 01:49.442
which, according to current intel,

01:49.526 --> 01:53.697
is now located on this Separatist
Dreadnought above Anaxes.

01:54.447 --> 01:58.243
Once I'm plugged in,
I can feed Trench strategies,

01:58.326 --> 02:02.622
but this time, you'll know every move
before he makes it.

02:02.706 --> 02:05.458
And you are certain
that if we get you onboard that ship,

02:05.542 --> 02:08.628
that you can convince Trench's army
to do what you want?

02:08.712 --> 02:10.213
Absolutely.

02:10.296 --> 02:13.550
Unfortunately,
I've been doing this for a while,

02:13.633 --> 02:18.013
but this time
I can help bring about a Republic victory

02:18.096 --> 02:19.723
instead of a defeat.

02:32.360 --> 02:34.112
Tech, is everything ready?

02:34.195 --> 02:36.072
Yup, Sarge. We are ready.

02:36.156 --> 02:38.783
Still not sure how we're gonna land
on that ship.

02:38.867 --> 02:40.910
Don't worry. Echo says he's got a plan.

02:40.994 --> 02:43.747
That makes me feel so much better.

02:43.830 --> 02:45.165
What do you mean by that?

02:45.248 --> 02:49.127
To be blunt, his mind belonged
to the Separatists until we unplugged him.

02:49.210 --> 02:51.671
We don't really know
where his loyalties lie.

02:51.755 --> 02:53.840
Yeah. Well, I know.

02:53.923 --> 02:54.924
Now, get moving.

03:13.234 --> 03:15.236
Please tell me
we are blowing something up.

03:16.071 --> 03:18.782
Sorry, Wrecker, this is strictly stealth.

03:18.865 --> 03:22.285
[groans] I hate that word.

03:22.369 --> 03:23.953
Echo, you're up.

03:24.037 --> 03:25.038
Don't worry.

03:25.121 --> 03:28.333
As soon as I plug in,
I'll send a signal to the command ship.

03:29.042 --> 03:31.252
What type of signal are you gonna send?

03:31.336 --> 03:33.838
Nothing that'll give us away, right?

03:34.255 --> 03:36.132
As far as the droids are concerned,

03:36.216 --> 03:40.178
we're just gonna be another one
of their shuttles coming in for a landing.

03:40.804 --> 03:43.306
And the regs think we take risks.

04:00.865 --> 04:02.784
We have an incoming ship.

04:03.576 --> 04:05.120
Is this one of ours?

04:05.203 --> 04:07.247
I've never seen this model.

04:12.127 --> 04:14.713
Sending the signal... now.

04:17.382 --> 04:19.759
Yep, it's one of ours.

04:19.843 --> 04:22.887
Roger, roger, Shuttle TC-159.

04:22.971 --> 04:24.973
<i>You may approach and land.</i>

04:25.598 --> 04:26.850
[groans]

04:26.933 --> 04:28.977
I'd still rather blow it up.

04:29.060 --> 04:31.730
I have a feeling you'll get your chance.

05:15.982 --> 05:17.776
Gold Leader, you're cleared for launch.

05:24.574 --> 05:26.826
Copy that, General. We are going in.

05:41.049 --> 05:42.384
Admiral Trench,

05:42.467 --> 05:46.763
the Jedi are attacking the assembly plant
with a large force.

05:46.846 --> 05:48.765
Yes. [clicks]

05:48.848 --> 05:55.480
Now I will use their arrogance
and desperation to our advantage.

06:09.703 --> 06:12.455
[energy pulsating]

06:17.544 --> 06:19.796
Tech, can you rig an interface?

06:19.879 --> 06:22.465
I assume that's a rhetorical question.

06:22.549 --> 06:25.260
We should make sure this comm vault
has no other entrances.

06:25.343 --> 06:26.344
I'm on it.

06:34.019 --> 06:36.980
[clicks] Contact Skako.

06:37.063 --> 06:42.110
I want to use the algorithm to calculate
the best possible counterattack.

06:42.193 --> 06:43.862
As you command.

06:49.117 --> 06:50.660
[switch clicks]

06:51.161 --> 06:54.914
All right, I have access to everything
and good timing.

06:54.998 --> 06:58.418
I just scanned a strategy request
Trench sent to the Techno Union.

06:58.501 --> 07:01.504
Wait.
You can't just send a signal from here.

07:01.588 --> 07:03.465
-Why not?
-We have to make it appear

07:03.548 --> 07:06.051
as if your signal
is originating from Skako Minor.

07:06.551 --> 07:08.386
Otherwise, they'll know we are here.

07:35.038 --> 07:38.124
My name is General Mace Windu
of the Jedi Order.

07:38.667 --> 07:40.293
At this point of the Clone War,

07:40.377 --> 07:44.130
I have dismantled and destroyed over
100,000 of you type one battle droids.

07:44.673 --> 07:48.343
I'm giving you an opportunity
to peacefully lay down your weapons

07:48.426 --> 07:51.262
so that you may be reprogrammed
to serve a better purpose

07:51.346 --> 07:53.640
than spreading the mindless
violence and chaos,

07:53.723 --> 07:56.184
which you have inflicted upon the galaxy.

07:57.602 --> 07:58.603
Blast them!

08:00.689 --> 08:03.316
Well, I guess it was worth a try.

08:24.838 --> 08:27.632
Here's the new strategy from Skako,
Admiral.

08:27.716 --> 08:31.469
Mobilize all troops on Anaxes
to the assembly complex.

08:31.553 --> 08:33.888
The Republic will not send reinforcements.

08:33.972 --> 08:37.392
They will put all their faith in the Jedi.

08:38.018 --> 08:40.311
[chuckles]

08:40.729 --> 08:42.897
Give the order.

08:48.737 --> 08:50.530
I'm intercepting a transmission.

08:50.613 --> 08:53.199
Trench is ordering all of his droids

08:53.992 --> 08:55.910
to the assembly complex.

08:56.870 --> 08:58.997
All right, Echo,
what are you trying to pull?

08:59.080 --> 09:01.666
Don't worry, that's what I told him to do.

09:02.083 --> 09:04.753
But our troops will be vastly outnumbered.

09:05.253 --> 09:09.549
Not when I send them a feedback pulse
that shuts down all the droids.

09:09.632 --> 09:12.385
How do we know
that's what you're really going to do?

09:13.053 --> 09:14.637
We have to trust him.

09:15.597 --> 09:16.598
Rex is right.

09:17.223 --> 09:19.559
Echo, we're all counting on you.

09:22.145 --> 09:23.730
[electronic beeps]

09:26.191 --> 09:28.485
Master Windu, I know this sounds crazy,

09:28.568 --> 09:31.404
but it's about to get
a little more crowded where you are.

09:31.488 --> 09:33.573
[Mace] <i>We have our hands full as it is.</i>

09:33.656 --> 09:34.783
<i>What is your plan?</i>

09:34.866 --> 09:37.035
Well, if it makes you feel any better,
it isn't my plan.

09:37.118 --> 09:39.204
Echo is drawing all the droids
to your position,

09:39.287 --> 09:41.289
so he can neutralize them all
at the same time.

09:51.216 --> 09:52.509
Obi-Wan!

09:52.592 --> 09:54.344
Skywalker just contacted me.

09:54.427 --> 09:56.638
He said we've got a lot more droids
headed our way.

09:57.138 --> 09:59.724
I see Anakin is being as insightful
as ever.

10:00.183 --> 10:01.518
I was told not to worry.

10:01.976 --> 10:03.603
It was all part of their plan.

10:03.687 --> 10:06.314
If I know Anakin, we've got the easy part.

10:13.321 --> 10:16.533
[Trench] The droids
are going to overwhelm the Jedi.

10:16.950 --> 10:21.371
They don't stand a chance. [chuckles]

10:34.175 --> 10:36.928
Well, there weren't as many
as I thought there were going to be.

10:43.810 --> 10:46.312
Does this meet your expectations?

10:46.396 --> 10:49.315
This exceeds my expectations.

11:00.493 --> 11:01.703
[battle droid] Hey!

11:02.412 --> 11:03.413
Shutting down.

11:04.414 --> 11:06.166
Awaiting orders.

11:11.880 --> 11:12.881
What?

11:13.631 --> 11:15.800
What was that?

11:16.259 --> 11:18.678
We monitored a powerful energy surge,

11:18.762 --> 11:21.139
which has overloaded
the droids' circuitry.

11:21.639 --> 11:24.601
We are tracking the origin
of this pulse now.

11:25.060 --> 11:28.355
[Mace] <i>I am pleased to report that we are</i>
<i>in control of the assembly complex,</i>

11:28.438 --> 11:32.317
<i>and all of the fronts are falling</i>
<i>to the Republic thanks to Echo's plan.</i>

11:32.400 --> 11:34.527
That's good news, Master Windu.

11:34.611 --> 11:36.112
We're on our way back to the base.

11:36.196 --> 11:37.697
[Mace] <i>May the Force be with you.</i>

11:37.781 --> 11:39.240
Good job, Echo.

11:39.324 --> 11:41.618
Well, I guess you actually are
on our side.

11:42.202 --> 11:44.204
Was there ever any doubt?

11:44.871 --> 11:46.039
Some.

11:46.414 --> 11:48.041
Well, thanks.

11:49.501 --> 11:50.543
Come on, brother.

11:50.627 --> 11:52.212
Unplug, and let's get out of here.

11:52.671 --> 11:55.590
The algorithm has never been wrong before.

11:56.299 --> 11:58.551
How could we have missed this?

11:58.635 --> 12:01.721
The source originated onboard this ship.

12:01.805 --> 12:03.973
Dispatch security droids.

12:04.057 --> 12:05.975
What about our apparent defeat?

12:06.059 --> 12:08.144
[chuckles]

12:08.895 --> 12:15.902
A wise leader does not rely completely
on things such as algorithms. [clicks]

12:15.985 --> 12:22.158
My personal strategy for victory
is through total annihilation.

12:22.826 --> 12:25.286
Wait,
I just scanned a new order from Trench.

12:26.079 --> 12:27.956
He's initiated a countdown.

12:28.039 --> 12:31.126
There's a bomb hidden
at the assembly complex,

12:31.209 --> 12:33.795
but it's big enough
to destroy most of Anaxes.

12:33.878 --> 12:35.255
Can you stop it?

12:35.338 --> 12:37.966
Well, I can try.

12:38.341 --> 12:39.634
General, where are you going?

12:39.968 --> 12:43.054
If you can't stop the detonation,
perhaps Trench can!

12:45.598 --> 12:49.477
[shouting, chattering]

12:49.561 --> 12:51.479
-Continue your sweep, Jesse.
-Sir.

12:51.563 --> 12:53.023
<i>General Windu, this is Tech.</i>

12:53.106 --> 12:55.275
<i>We've discovered a bomb</i>
<i>in the fusion reactor.</i>

12:55.358 --> 12:57.610
<i>We need someone to go down there</i>
<i>and help disarm it.</i>

12:58.069 --> 12:59.070
I'm on my way.

13:03.908 --> 13:05.076
Get the men out of here.

13:06.327 --> 13:07.746
You heard General Windu.

13:07.829 --> 13:10.498
Organize your platoons, and have them
evacuate as soon as possible.

13:10.582 --> 13:11.750
[Jesse] Sir, yes, sir!

13:16.296 --> 13:19.799
[energy pulsating]

14:02.884 --> 14:03.885
Ray shield.

14:04.886 --> 14:06.805
Echo, I found the bomb.

14:06.888 --> 14:08.807
Tell me the sequence to shut it down.

14:08.890 --> 14:10.141
I'm decrypting it now.

14:10.225 --> 14:12.560
You have to unplug.
They're going to detect us.

14:12.644 --> 14:14.229
No, no, we need these codes.

14:14.896 --> 14:17.315
The first number in the sequence is three.

14:22.570 --> 14:23.571
[electronic beep]

14:23.655 --> 14:25.824
[Echo] <i>The next is... one.</i>

14:28.702 --> 14:29.994
-[beep continues]
-<i>Eight.</i>

14:30.078 --> 14:31.079
[beep continues]

14:31.162 --> 14:33.540
We have located the source of the pulse.

14:34.833 --> 14:36.876
-[Echo] <i>Seven.</i>
-[beep continues]

14:36.960 --> 14:39.713
Jam the signal at its source.

14:39.796 --> 14:42.173
[Tech] They're on to us.
You need to unplug now!

14:43.216 --> 14:44.259
[screams]

14:46.970 --> 14:47.971
[Mace] <i>Echo?</i>

14:48.054 --> 14:51.725
The server overloaded his neural system,
and it appears deliberate.

14:51.808 --> 14:53.893
-[Mace] <i>Echo!</i>
-That means Trench knows we're here.

14:54.436 --> 14:55.437
[Mace] <i>Echo, are you there?</i>

14:56.771 --> 14:58.732
General Windu, Trench took out Echo.

14:58.815 --> 15:00.900
We can't get you the last number
in the sequence.

15:00.984 --> 15:03.778
<i>Sorry, General, you'll have</i>
<i>to disarm that bomb without us.</i>

15:03.862 --> 15:06.573
Don't worry about me, Captain.
Just get your men out of there.

15:06.656 --> 15:07.657
Yes, sir.

15:14.914 --> 15:16.082
We got company!

15:23.882 --> 15:28.803
The Jedi lacks the final sequences
to stop the detonation.

15:29.763 --> 15:34.142
The loss of clones at the shipyard
will seal the Republic's fate.

15:34.851 --> 15:38.980
Dispatch more units
to deal with the infiltrators on the ship,

15:39.064 --> 15:43.443
and prepare our landing craft
for our next assault.

15:43.526 --> 15:45.111
As you command.

15:46.571 --> 15:47.614
Huh?

15:51.493 --> 15:53.078
Jedi scum.

16:08.635 --> 16:10.929
Tell me the sequence to disarm the bomb!

16:11.012 --> 16:12.222
Never.

16:12.305 --> 16:16.059
Dooku would kill me for losing Anaxes.

16:16.142 --> 16:18.103
And you think I won't?

16:18.186 --> 16:20.397
You're a Jedi.

16:20.480 --> 16:21.523
Your nobility--

16:21.606 --> 16:22.774
[grunts]

16:25.360 --> 16:27.112
I don't have such weaknesses!

16:27.862 --> 16:29.572
Now, let's try that again.

16:38.206 --> 16:42.043
Mace, if you can't stop the detonation,
you must leave now.

16:42.460 --> 16:43.628
[Mace] <i>That is not an option.</i>

16:44.087 --> 16:48.091
I still have a chance to stop this,
even if it's down to my best guess.

16:48.174 --> 16:50.719
[Anakin] <i>How about I take</i>
<i>the guesswork out of it, Master?</i>

16:50.802 --> 16:54.806
Admiral Trench was kind enough
to give me the final number himself.

16:54.889 --> 16:56.057
<i>Try seven.</i>

17:02.313 --> 17:03.148
[electronic beep]

17:10.030 --> 17:11.406
Good work, Skywalker.

17:11.865 --> 17:13.408
The bomb has been disarmed.

17:13.491 --> 17:15.910
-You both owe me one now.
-[Trench clicks]

17:18.163 --> 17:20.665
[grunts, groans]

17:20.957 --> 17:22.959
[screams, groans]

17:34.721 --> 17:37.682
[chuckles] Wrecker's gonna love this.

17:38.975 --> 17:40.977
Admiral, it was a pleasure.

17:42.062 --> 17:44.022
[groans, clicks]

17:44.981 --> 17:46.566
[battle droid screams]

17:54.783 --> 17:56.284
Hey! Fire!

18:01.164 --> 18:03.583
[Rex] We can't blast our way out.
There's too many of them.

18:07.754 --> 18:08.838
[cracks knuckles]

18:11.591 --> 18:12.592
What's he doing?

18:12.676 --> 18:15.637
[Wrecker] Time to release
the wrecking ball!

18:15.720 --> 18:16.721
Yeah!

18:16.971 --> 18:19.140
-[screams]
-[laughs]

18:21.685 --> 18:22.811
[battle droid] Hey!

18:22.894 --> 18:25.146
[Hunter] I honestly feel bad
for those droids.

18:31.861 --> 18:33.571
[battle droid whimpers]

18:33.655 --> 18:34.906
[Wrecker] It's all clear!

18:35.573 --> 18:37.117
[battle droid] Please, not the face.

18:37.200 --> 18:38.868
Not the face!

18:44.499 --> 18:45.583
[Tech] More droids.

18:45.667 --> 18:48.128
[Crosshair] Go. I'll buy you some time.

18:51.548 --> 18:52.549
Sticky.

18:52.632 --> 18:53.591
[screams]

18:58.221 --> 19:00.015
[Rex] We'll meet you
at the infiltration point.

19:01.224 --> 19:02.392
[Wrecker] Oh!

19:02.475 --> 19:04.436
He's gonna try and top me.

19:04.519 --> 19:05.603
You watch.

19:19.325 --> 19:21.161
[Hunter] This is the infiltration point.

19:22.037 --> 19:24.581
[Tech] I'm picking up dozens of droids
on my sensors,

19:24.664 --> 19:26.082
all heading this way.

19:26.750 --> 19:28.293
[Anakin] Hope you're not waiting on me.

19:29.878 --> 19:31.796
[Hunter] Now all we're missing
is Crosshair.

19:36.301 --> 19:37.302
[beeps]

19:38.845 --> 19:40.221
You miss me?

19:42.807 --> 19:44.601
How touching.

19:58.698 --> 20:02.160
Relax, Wrecker. You'll top him next time.

20:02.243 --> 20:03.661
No, he won't.

20:04.371 --> 20:05.914
[Wrecker cries]

20:14.756 --> 20:16.591
I've got a present for you, Wrecker.

20:17.217 --> 20:19.594
Oh, seriously?

20:19.678 --> 20:22.722
I get to blow it up?
The whole stinking thing?

20:26.976 --> 20:31.898
This is the happiest day of my life.

20:49.582 --> 20:52.419
Captain Rex, Corporal Echo
and Clone Force 99,

20:53.128 --> 20:55.422
you have all done a great service
for the Republic.

20:55.505 --> 20:57.173
Thanks to your courage and effort,

20:57.257 --> 20:59.926
Republic shipyards
will soon be up and running again.

21:00.760 --> 21:02.679
You've got some medals coming your way.

21:03.304 --> 21:04.431
Thank you, General.

21:10.562 --> 21:11.604
You coming?

21:12.313 --> 21:14.399
Not really our thing.

21:14.482 --> 21:16.151
Accolades.

21:16.234 --> 21:20.030
Yeah, we're just in it for the thrill. Yo!

21:20.113 --> 21:22.115
You sure it's your thing?

21:23.408 --> 21:24.492
What do you mean?

21:24.576 --> 21:26.244
Your path is different.

21:27.120 --> 21:28.663
[chuckles] Like ours.

21:29.789 --> 21:32.083
If you ever feel
like you don't fit in with them,

21:32.625 --> 21:34.753
well, find us.

21:41.426 --> 21:45.263
Those are some of the finest troopers
I've ever fought alongside.

21:47.015 --> 21:48.016
Echo.

21:49.351 --> 21:50.935
You and I go way back.

21:51.895 --> 21:54.898
If that's where you feel your place is,

21:55.565 --> 21:57.484
then that's where you belong.
