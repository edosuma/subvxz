01:47.313 --> 01:49.614
What are you reading?

01:49.616 --> 01:52.417
- <i>Quantum Computing Algorithms.</i>
- <i>Right turn ahead.</i>

01:52.419 --> 01:55.920
- It's Eddy's book.
- Sounds complicated, mate.

01:55.922 --> 01:58.759
- I think I've got it.
- They're cool people.

02:00.393 --> 02:02.894
You so don't have it.

02:02.896 --> 02:04.795
Yes, Mum,
I'll behave myself.

02:04.797 --> 02:06.798
Mike,
tell us how it's done.

02:06.800 --> 02:08.966
Not a chance. You can
figure it out for yourselves.

02:08.967 --> 02:11.936
Yeah, we're all here.
No, it's not weird.

02:11.938 --> 02:14.505
<i>You have reached
your destination.</i>

02:14.507 --> 02:16.708
- Hello? Mum?
- I think this is it.

02:16.710 --> 02:19.344
- <i>Recalculating route.</i>
- Oh, hang on, hang on.

02:19.346 --> 02:21.946
- <i>Please turn around.</i>
- We're breaking up.

02:21.948 --> 02:24.649
- Hello? Hello?
- What the hell?

02:24.651 --> 02:27.688
Mum, if you can still
hear me, I'm hanging up. OK.

02:55.249 --> 02:57.982
Well, I suppose
this is the place.

02:57.984 --> 03:00.785
Looks a bit different
than advertised.

03:00.787 --> 03:02.789
It looks great, Eddy.

03:09.329 --> 03:11.862
- Oh, sorry. Are you alright?
- I give up.

03:11.864 --> 03:13.867
Mum, we just talked.

03:14.901 --> 03:16.905
Sorry? What?

03:18.839 --> 03:20.842
Can you repeat that?

03:22.376 --> 03:24.041
Who is this?

03:24.043 --> 03:27.045
- Guys, a hand, please.
- Yeah, sorry, John!

03:27.047 --> 03:29.817
- It's Jaan.
- I think wrong number.

03:31.619 --> 03:34.255
- Bye.
- Hello?

03:36.556 --> 03:37.922
I'm here.

03:37.924 --> 03:39.726
Thanks, Ray.

03:41.394 --> 03:43.862
Is Ray your real name,
or is it short for something?

03:43.864 --> 03:46.832
- Sunray?
- Moonray?

03:46.834 --> 03:48.966
Stingray.

03:48.968 --> 03:51.903
- Don't you guys know either?
- No, not even close.

03:51.905 --> 03:53.704
What, you thought,
she looks like a hippie,

03:53.706 --> 03:55.474
she must have
some silly hippie name?

03:55.476 --> 03:57.775
- Yeah.
- Nah, it's Rainbow.

03:57.777 --> 04:00.345
Oh, so much better.
Not hippie at all.

04:00.347 --> 04:01.849
Much better.

04:03.716 --> 04:06.385
- Cheers, mate.
- Everything OK, Eddy?

04:06.387 --> 04:11.790
Edward. My name is Edward.
I told you all before.

04:11.792 --> 04:15.597
Only my wife calls me Eddy.
Much to my chagrin.

04:21.668 --> 04:22.770
Ladies first?

04:24.737 --> 04:26.937
- Edward.
- Watch it.

04:26.939 --> 04:31.610
- Careful, Mike, careful.
- This place is huge!

04:31.612 --> 04:35.913
- No shit, Miss Marple.
- And very... '70s.

04:35.915 --> 04:38.383
- It's vile.
- Yes.

04:38.385 --> 04:40.819
Yes, it is.

04:40.821 --> 04:43.088
- Drafty too.
- Well, I like it.

04:43.090 --> 04:45.891
Hey, didn't the leaflet say that
this place was accessible to...

04:45.893 --> 04:48.927
Wheelchairs?
Um, I don't know. Did it?

04:48.929 --> 04:50.761
- I don't remember.
- Well, why would you?

04:50.763 --> 04:52.730
But, yeah, I'm sure
it said so in the leaflet.

04:52.732 --> 04:55.566
Yes, it did,
as a matter of fact.

04:55.568 --> 04:57.802
I think the brochure exaggerated
in quite a few ways.

04:57.804 --> 05:00.905
Exaggerated? It's called lying
where I come from, Eddy.

05:00.907 --> 05:03.475
Right, none of the rooms
down here are suitable for you.

05:03.477 --> 05:05.110
We'll figure it out, mate.

05:05.112 --> 05:07.045
The kitchen
and living room are up here.

05:07.047 --> 05:09.081
- A bedroom for Jaan?
- And a bathroom?

05:09.083 --> 05:11.016
Yeah, both.
And there's a terrace.

05:11.018 --> 05:14.819
Wicked. Cheers, Elsie.
Right, let's do this, then.

05:14.821 --> 05:16.787
- Teamwork, right?
- Yeah, absolutely.

05:16.789 --> 05:18.924
Even though only one of us
is putting his back into it.

05:18.926 --> 05:22.694
OK, ready? Two, three.

05:22.696 --> 05:24.595
- Whoa.
- Careful.

05:24.597 --> 05:27.367
- Hold on!
- No, that's not working.

05:48.455 --> 05:52.023
Oh! I'm sorry. More to explore.

05:52.025 --> 05:54.626
At least you smell nice.

05:54.628 --> 05:56.660
It's alright,
take your time, guys.

05:56.662 --> 05:58.499
- Coming. Sorry.
- That's helpful.

06:00.133 --> 06:03.468
Mate, I tell you what,
I don't care what happens,

06:03.470 --> 06:05.636
you're stuck on this floor
for the rest of the weekend.

06:05.638 --> 06:08.139
- Thanks a lot. Thanks a lot.
- No problem at all.

06:08.141 --> 06:10.574
There's even more
bedrooms and bathrooms up here.

06:10.576 --> 06:12.143
- Really nice ones, actually.
- Dibs!

06:12.145 --> 06:14.912
Oh, you are so immature.

06:14.914 --> 06:18.016
- Really?
- This way for you.

06:18.018 --> 06:19.684
I can handle a level floor,
you know.

06:19.686 --> 06:22.052
And at the far end,
your chambers.

06:22.054 --> 06:25.790
Oh, sorry. Let's see.

06:25.792 --> 06:28.593
- I forgot how big this is.
- Well, don't worry.

06:28.595 --> 06:31.099
You'll soon get used
to how big it is, saucepot.

06:32.064 --> 06:34.067
Stop it, Jaan.

06:37.905 --> 06:39.006
I'm sorry.

06:42.075 --> 06:45.177
And here's me thinking that
you're all serious and stuff.

06:45.179 --> 06:46.948
Yeah, well, don't tell anyone.

06:48.448 --> 06:50.047
I thought it would be
a good idea

06:50.049 --> 06:52.049
if we could toast
our weekend together.

06:52.051 --> 06:54.453
I brought champagne, munchies.

06:54.455 --> 06:56.855
Well, I'll get a bowl
for whatever's in there,

06:56.857 --> 06:59.191
and glasses.

06:59.193 --> 07:00.862
Sweet.

07:02.996 --> 07:05.566
- The curtains are great.
- A bit garish.

07:14.575 --> 07:16.077
Mike?

07:22.616 --> 07:24.749
Can I help?

07:24.751 --> 07:26.617
- No, she's got it.
- Did anybody...

07:26.619 --> 07:27.751
Whoop!

07:37.864 --> 07:39.533
Oh, cheers.

07:41.902 --> 07:46.304
Ah, thanks, Elsie,
for organizing all of this.

07:46.306 --> 07:49.908
Um, today marks a year

07:49.910 --> 07:53.578
since the events
which brought us together,

07:53.580 --> 07:58.917
um, and brought us to
the wonderful, capable doctor

07:58.919 --> 08:00.755
and group therapy.

08:01.854 --> 08:05.492
Um, and a year since, um...

08:06.826 --> 08:07.828
since Joey.

08:09.229 --> 08:13.098
So may he rest in peace.

08:13.100 --> 08:15.900
Now, we've been through a lot,
but this weekend is about

08:15.902 --> 08:20.739
putting all that stuff behind us
and just having a good time.

08:20.741 --> 08:25.643
- So, cheers, everybody.
- Cheers.

08:25.645 --> 08:27.011
To no more group therapy.

08:27.013 --> 08:28.612
To no more
group therapy.

08:28.614 --> 08:30.282
- To Joey.
- Joey.

08:30.284 --> 08:32.616
He had his whole life
ahead of him.

08:32.619 --> 08:36.755
Yeah, which he wasted trying
to stop a bullet with his face.

08:36.756 --> 08:39.722
Come on, Edward.
The kid was brave.

08:39.725 --> 08:41.626
Eddy isn't mocking.
He's just...

08:41.628 --> 08:43.594
I'm just pointing out facts.

08:43.596 --> 08:48.098
Well, the fact is, Joey died
saving us. Sometimes...

08:48.100 --> 08:51.938
Sometimes you feel guilty,
like the doctor said.

08:54.240 --> 08:57.107
On a lighter note, look at this.

08:57.109 --> 08:59.746
- Come on, show them, Eddy.
- Oh.

09:02.081 --> 09:04.082
Ta-da.

09:04.084 --> 09:08.819
It's meant to be symbolic
of you surviving the situation.

09:08.821 --> 09:13.024
You see? Six. For the hostages.

09:13.026 --> 09:15.193
I know I wasn't
directly involved, but...

09:15.195 --> 09:17.929
- I can't believe this.
- It's just a tattoo.

09:17.931 --> 09:20.098
Have I offended you?

09:20.100 --> 09:23.300
I didn't mean to intrude
or minimize your experience.

09:23.302 --> 09:25.303
- I just thought...
- No, it's not that.

09:25.305 --> 09:27.771
- Then what's the problem?
- Well, I got one too.

09:27.773 --> 09:31.141
With a six in it. Look.

09:31.143 --> 09:33.678
OK,
that is a mad coincidence.

09:33.680 --> 09:35.750
You think
that's a coincidence?

09:37.850 --> 09:39.217
Serendipity.

09:39.219 --> 09:41.088
Oh, my God, you hippie.

09:42.788 --> 09:45.857
Didn't we talk about this
in therapy?

09:45.859 --> 09:48.827
No,
tattoos didn't come up.

09:48.829 --> 09:50.830
Do you wanna
see something creepy?

09:55.134 --> 09:56.867
Ta-da-da-da!

09:56.869 --> 09:59.039
Yeah, alright, then,
what are the odds?

10:01.774 --> 10:03.040
- No, I mean...
- That is so...

10:03.042 --> 10:05.175
I mean, no, quite literally.

10:05.177 --> 10:07.277
So what are the odds
of this happening?

10:07.279 --> 10:09.814
I mean, you know,
it's the exact same style.

10:09.816 --> 10:12.383
- I mean, it's the same six.
- What are you getting at?

10:12.385 --> 10:14.285
Well, this is some kind
of joke, right?

10:14.287 --> 10:17.391
I mean, what,
trick the scientist?

10:18.925 --> 10:21.092
Well, go on, then, mate.
Show us yours.

10:21.094 --> 10:22.926
No, I'm too old for a game of

10:22.928 --> 10:25.163
"I'll show you mine
if you show me yours," mate,

10:25.165 --> 10:26.897
and for tattoos.

10:26.899 --> 10:29.199
So you're trying to tell me that

10:29.201 --> 10:31.969
apart from Elsie and I,
who got this done together,

10:31.971 --> 10:34.439
the rest of you
decided independently

10:34.441 --> 10:38.242
to get this particular tattoo
done in this style, hmm?

10:38.244 --> 10:40.681
Well, apart from Mike.

10:41.848 --> 10:44.248
- Serendipity.
- Yeah, right.

10:44.250 --> 10:46.252
Now, I'm not stupid.

10:50.023 --> 10:53.724
OK, I'm going to get the rest
of my luggage from the car.

10:53.726 --> 10:56.797
Here's to a delightful weekend
in the country.

10:58.798 --> 11:01.732
You know the weird thing?
I didn't even want a tattoo.

11:01.734 --> 11:05.205
I get talked into it
by some bloke in the pub.

11:22.055 --> 11:25.356
And this never did come up
in therapy, did it?

11:25.358 --> 11:28.262
Reunion, yeah. Tattoos, no.

11:29.463 --> 11:31.899
- Are you OK, Edward?
- What?

11:32.733 --> 11:34.799
Oh, sure.

11:34.801 --> 11:37.035
Oh, cramp.

11:37.037 --> 11:40.405
Or carpal tunnel or something.
I don't know.

11:40.407 --> 11:44.508
This is all so bizarre. Why
would we all have the same idea?

11:44.510 --> 11:47.846
The place we got the tattoo,
what was it called again?

11:47.848 --> 11:51.315
I can't remember. It was
some awful pun with "inks."

11:51.317 --> 11:53.150
Jinx!

11:53.152 --> 11:55.753
Jinx.

11:55.755 --> 11:59.357
'Cause we all said
the same thing at the same time.

11:59.359 --> 12:04.462
So, we all got the tattoo
at exactly the same place

12:04.464 --> 12:08.900
and dare I assume with the same
unsavory tattoo artist?

12:08.902 --> 12:11.169
She was rather creepy.

12:11.171 --> 12:15.839
Right, well, that's it.
I'm calling this lady.

12:15.841 --> 12:18.309
I'm all for practical jokes...

12:18.311 --> 12:20.477
Actually, I'm not.

12:20.479 --> 12:24.348
Well, what does it matter?
It's nice, no?

12:24.350 --> 12:27.084
Damn. It's... It's dead.

12:27.086 --> 12:31.256
I... Did I forget
to charge the phone?

12:31.258 --> 12:33.359
Well, I just charged mine.

12:36.529 --> 12:40.166
Oh, weird. It's dead too.

12:41.433 --> 12:43.103
So's mine.

12:44.838 --> 12:46.337
What a day.

12:46.339 --> 12:48.506
I told you
we should have stayed at home.

12:48.508 --> 12:50.073
This is getting ridiculous.

12:50.075 --> 12:52.075
Well, I'll just go get
my charger from the car.

12:52.077 --> 12:55.179
- Didn't you get the bags, Eddy?
- What?

12:55.181 --> 12:58.583
No, I, um, must have forgotten.

12:58.585 --> 13:00.852
The doorway effect.
You forget things when...

13:00.854 --> 13:03.858
Don't play amateur psychologist.

13:09.562 --> 13:12.232
It is drafty in here, isn't it?

13:17.870 --> 13:20.271
What is it?

13:20.273 --> 13:23.341
- What happened?
- It's my back. It hurts.

13:23.343 --> 13:25.977
Uh, it felt like
a whole bunch of,

13:25.979 --> 13:28.378
I don't know,
needles or something.

13:28.380 --> 13:30.481
- Take a look.
- Ray?

13:30.483 --> 13:33.617
- Does this hurt?
- No.

13:33.619 --> 13:35.587
I thought you had a tattoo
with a six in it.

13:35.589 --> 13:38.555
- Yeah.
- That's a five.

13:38.557 --> 13:42.327
Don't be ridiculous.
I mean, tattoos don't change.

13:42.329 --> 13:44.661
- This?
- No, it doesn't hurt anymore.

13:44.663 --> 13:46.598
- It was just a sudden pain.
- But...

13:46.600 --> 13:50.868
She may have asked for a six,
but the woman drew a five

13:50.870 --> 13:53.304
and we all got confused,
you know.

13:53.306 --> 13:57.242
Observer-expectancy effect.
Cognitive bias?

13:57.244 --> 13:59.410
I'm really looking forward
to reading your book, mate.

13:59.412 --> 14:01.445
It's just strange
that we didn't notice it before.

14:01.447 --> 14:04.181
- No, it's not.
- Mike?

14:04.183 --> 14:05.683
Look, I can't remember
what I saw,

14:05.685 --> 14:08.185
but, I mean,
that's clearly a five, so...

14:08.187 --> 14:10.487
Look, I don't even see
why this is a conversation.

14:10.489 --> 14:14.258
It's a bloody tattoo. It's five.
It always has been five.

14:14.260 --> 14:17.628
What the fuck's going on down
there? Talk to me, somebody.

14:17.630 --> 14:20.100
Nothing. Everything's fine.

14:21.401 --> 14:22.599
Oh, yeah, great, OK, fine.

14:22.601 --> 14:24.604
Don't tell the fucking cripple.

14:42.221 --> 14:44.488
Just let me know
if the pain comes back.

14:44.490 --> 14:45.990
- I'm OK.
- Let's go upstairs.

14:45.992 --> 14:47.424
I know you are.

14:47.426 --> 14:49.026
I guess I'll go get the charger.

14:49.028 --> 14:50.998
No, no. No. Um...

14:52.065 --> 14:54.535
I'll do it. You stay inside.

15:24.630 --> 15:26.132
Fuck!

15:30.269 --> 15:31.604
What?

15:41.681 --> 15:45.116
Fuck. Oh, God,
this can't be happening.

15:45.118 --> 15:47.986
Eddy, are you alright?
What's going on?

15:47.988 --> 15:50.088
Did you hurt your wrist?

15:50.090 --> 15:52.357
For God's sake, Elsie,
I'm not a child!

15:52.359 --> 15:54.360
Just stay in the house.

15:56.495 --> 15:58.164
OK...

16:02.435 --> 16:05.136
Yes, darling, why don't we
go away for the weekend

16:05.138 --> 16:07.738
with some people I met
in a hideous situation

16:07.740 --> 16:10.009
where someone fucking died?

16:11.710 --> 16:12.745
Delightful.

16:17.450 --> 16:21.088
Fuck. Fuck!

16:27.694 --> 16:29.430
Not that one!

16:30.463 --> 16:32.099
There's my smile.

16:33.233 --> 16:35.333
I smile at everyone, Jaan.

16:35.335 --> 16:37.104
It doesn't mean you're special.

16:38.104 --> 16:39.337
Oh, God.

16:39.339 --> 16:41.304
Edward, what's going on?

16:41.306 --> 16:44.074
- What's happening to me?
- Edward!

16:44.076 --> 16:46.179
Show me your wrist, mate!

16:48.114 --> 16:51.681
- I'm not your mate!
- Edward!

16:51.683 --> 16:56.154
I'm gonna find a nice hotel
and empty the fucking minibar.

17:11.838 --> 17:16.741
I'm sorry I... Sorry
I made things weird earlier.

17:16.742 --> 17:18.608
Look,
can you just, like...

17:18.609 --> 17:20.012
I feel like you're crowding me.

17:24.451 --> 17:26.119
I'm trying to help you.

17:27.553 --> 17:29.787
- Help me?
- Beth!

17:29.789 --> 17:31.692
- You're no hero, Jaan.
- Beth!

17:32.658 --> 17:35.693
Elsie? Elsie.

17:35.695 --> 17:37.297
What's wrong?

17:38.263 --> 17:39.465
No. No, no, no, no.

17:44.637 --> 17:46.706
His... His face.

18:01.920 --> 18:04.090
Oh, Jesus Christ.

18:05.291 --> 18:06.292
Fuck.

19:02.682 --> 19:05.383
So are we stuck here?

19:05.385 --> 19:08.251
It's like the robbery.

19:08.253 --> 19:10.922
Well, that's a year of therapy
down the drain, then.

19:10.924 --> 19:12.926
Do you think this is funny?

19:15.494 --> 19:18.361
Do you think making jokes now
is a good idea?

19:18.363 --> 19:20.298
I don't know. Maybe it is.

19:20.300 --> 19:22.934
It's not like anyone's told me
what the fuck's going on.

19:22.936 --> 19:25.235
I'm the one who got a bullet
in the back from that day,

19:25.237 --> 19:26.971
so I'm allowed
a bit of dark humor.

19:26.973 --> 19:29.540
That's what you get for running
away like a little bitch!

19:29.542 --> 19:31.474
Shot in the back like a coward.

19:31.476 --> 19:33.778
And Joey was shot in the face
like a hero?

19:33.780 --> 19:35.946
It's thanks to him you're alive.

19:35.948 --> 19:39.015
And Beth and Mike who dragged
your worthless piece of...

19:39.017 --> 19:42.155
- You weren't even there!
- Hey!

19:58.972 --> 20:01.371
It's not helping.

20:01.373 --> 20:03.808
Let's just focus...

20:03.810 --> 20:06.379
Did anyone check the house
for a landline?

20:11.818 --> 20:16.253
Elsie, are you gonna be OK
just for a bit? Yeah?

20:16.255 --> 20:19.959
OK, great, let's go look
for a phone, get some help.

20:23.996 --> 20:25.998
I found it.

20:37.644 --> 20:38.776
Hello?

20:38.778 --> 20:40.011
<i>Please remain calm, sir.</i>

20:40.013 --> 20:43.446
Oh, not a sir, and I am calm.

20:43.448 --> 20:45.348
<i>Why don't you take
a deep breath?</i>

20:45.350 --> 20:46.349
OK.

20:49.656 --> 20:51.355
OK, I'm good now.

20:51.357 --> 20:54.524
<i>OK, that's better, sir.
You're doing alright.</i>

20:54.526 --> 20:59.363
Uh, I'm not a sir,
and we have a situation here.

20:59.365 --> 21:01.401
I did what needed
to be done, alright?

21:03.770 --> 21:05.705
That's not what Eddy said.

21:06.738 --> 21:09.773
You just took care of yourself.

21:09.775 --> 21:13.711
- Is that what he told you?
- Yes.

21:13.713 --> 21:18.581
That's bullshit.
I was trying to raise the alarm.

21:18.583 --> 21:21.886
<i>No, stay put. How many
are there on the other side?</i>

21:21.888 --> 21:25.423
What other side?
What do you mean?

21:25.425 --> 21:28.492
<i>No, leave them inside, sir.
It may be harmful...</i>

21:28.494 --> 21:32.730
But he... he's not inside.
Hello?

21:32.732 --> 21:36.099
<i>You did very well, sir.
The officer in charge...</i>

21:36.101 --> 21:37.436
Hang up.

21:38.905 --> 21:41.871
Um, sorry, I'm not a sir.
What? Hello?

21:41.873 --> 21:43.376
Just hang up.

21:44.577 --> 21:46.647
OK, what the fuck was that?

21:47.980 --> 21:50.414
I'm gonna try again.

21:50.416 --> 21:52.515
- Ow!
- What is it? What...?

21:52.517 --> 21:54.484
- Your back again?
- Yeah.

21:54.486 --> 21:56.453
- Oh, my God.
- What the hell?

21:56.455 --> 21:59.589
I didn't see your precious Eddy
do anything.

21:59.591 --> 22:02.492
He didn't get Joey killed.

22:02.494 --> 22:05.532
You did. You did.

22:06.965 --> 22:09.799
You didn't even know Joey.

22:09.801 --> 22:13.404
- You're all a bunch of cowards.
- You weren't even there!

22:13.406 --> 22:15.405
But I didn't go outside.
I don't get it.

22:15.407 --> 22:18.576
Something must be
triggering this countdown.

22:18.578 --> 22:20.744
You're all cowards!

22:20.746 --> 22:24.915
Eddy died. He died. Horribly.

22:24.917 --> 22:27.417
And you all let him die!
You all left him out there!

22:27.419 --> 22:29.753
- Well, so did you.
- Mike.

22:29.755 --> 22:33.124
You have nothing to hide.

22:33.126 --> 22:35.024
Elsie, you really need
to just...

22:35.026 --> 22:37.528
You. You did this, all of this!

22:37.530 --> 22:38.928
You need to relax!

22:38.930 --> 22:41.600
Because you're starting
to lose your marbles.

22:44.137 --> 22:45.472
No!

22:49.542 --> 22:52.976
What's going on? Ray?

22:52.978 --> 22:55.044
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. I'm...

22:55.046 --> 22:58.982
Rainbow, look at me.
It's OK. Alright.

22:58.984 --> 23:01.918
Mike, get me a towel.

23:01.920 --> 23:03.887
What happened?

23:03.889 --> 23:06.624
Ray? Ray? What happened?

23:06.626 --> 23:10.461
Let me see. OK, don't worry.
I've seen a lot worse.

23:10.463 --> 23:15.433
No, no, it's my back.
I felt it sting.

23:15.435 --> 23:19.904
- It's down to three.
- Why is this happening, Beth?

23:19.906 --> 23:22.606
I don't know yet,
but we will figure this out.

23:22.608 --> 23:26.676
- Guys, you need to see this.
- Shut up or I swear I will...

23:26.678 --> 23:29.512
I'm down to three.
We have to figure this out now.

23:29.514 --> 23:31.482
OK, this needs stitches.

23:31.484 --> 23:33.684
Mike, can you see if there's
a first-aid kit here about

23:33.686 --> 23:35.719
or something else
that can serve as bandages?

23:35.721 --> 23:38.489
- Guys, this is important.
- I told you to shut up.

23:38.491 --> 23:43.726
Jaan. Come over here.
I need your help. Come on.

23:43.728 --> 23:45.731
OK, just put pressure here.

23:48.234 --> 23:49.602
Great.

23:50.703 --> 23:52.101
Is it really that bad?

23:52.103 --> 23:54.204
No, no, it's not that.
I can fix this.

23:54.206 --> 23:55.941
I just really need
my suture kit.

23:57.974 --> 23:58.210
Beth.

23:59.878 --> 24:03.483
Elsie, I need you
to come back down, OK?

24:04.984 --> 24:06.051
It went up.

24:07.119 --> 24:08.955
My number.

24:10.490 --> 24:11.992
It went up.

24:20.832 --> 24:26.270
I can't. Eddy's out there.
He's just... lying there.

24:26.272 --> 24:28.539
Maybe I don't really
need stitches?

24:28.541 --> 24:30.811
- You need stitches.
- Well, then, we need your bag.

24:32.011 --> 24:33.543
And it's in the car.

24:33.545 --> 24:34.747
OK, so go get it.

24:36.715 --> 24:37.714
What? What have I said?

24:37.716 --> 24:39.082
Nobody tells me anything

24:39.084 --> 24:40.518
and I'm supposed to know.

24:40.520 --> 24:42.619
It's the tattoos, Jaan.

24:42.621 --> 24:45.188
Going outside
makes them go down.

24:45.190 --> 24:48.925
- It's my arm. I'll go.
- No, you're down at three.

24:48.927 --> 24:50.528
It's not only
the doctor's bag, is it?

24:50.530 --> 24:52.029
Everything's still in the car,

24:52.031 --> 24:53.696
including all the food
for the weekend.

24:53.698 --> 24:55.167
There's fuck all to eat
in the kitchen.

24:57.669 --> 24:59.171
Someone needs to go down there.

25:00.840 --> 25:03.674
OK, so she goes.
She slashed at Ray.

25:03.676 --> 25:05.242
Somehow she managed to get
an extra point.

25:05.244 --> 25:06.876
- She can afford the loss.
- Nice.

25:06.878 --> 25:08.745
We're calling them
points now, are we?

25:08.747 --> 25:11.982
Hang on a minute. You don't have
a tattoo. Why don't you go?

25:11.984 --> 25:13.317
Because you've all got
six chances

25:13.319 --> 25:14.818
and I might not have any.

25:14.820 --> 25:16.787
I don't see you
fucking volunteering.

25:16.789 --> 25:19.723
Do you wanna carry me down
the stairs and wheel me out?

25:19.725 --> 25:21.791
Yes, I'll happily
carry you down the stairs.

25:21.793 --> 25:23.961
And you can bring all the stuff
in on your fucking lap.

25:23.963 --> 25:26.931
Joey would do it.

25:26.933 --> 25:30.033
- Fine, I'll go.
- No, I'll go.

25:30.035 --> 25:32.336
No, no, it can wait.

25:32.338 --> 25:35.004
First let's figure out
what's causing these countdowns.

25:35.006 --> 25:36.941
I'll be quick.

25:36.943 --> 25:40.213
Does anyone need anything
that's important from the car?

25:41.746 --> 25:43.249
Medication?

25:44.884 --> 25:46.750
- OK.
- Beth...

25:46.752 --> 25:48.088
Oh, fuck.

25:57.929 --> 25:59.930
- You don't...
- Yes, she does.

25:59.932 --> 26:02.165
- We've been through this.
- Jaan, I'm sick...

26:02.167 --> 26:04.169
It's OK. He's right.

26:06.906 --> 26:08.542
Go on, then.

26:11.877 --> 26:13.213
Go!

27:00.659 --> 27:02.661
Are you OK?

27:05.296 --> 27:07.998
It's five. I'm sorry.

27:08.000 --> 27:10.670
It's not your fault.
And we knew that would happen.

27:47.840 --> 27:50.843
You're not gonna try
and stab me again, are you?

28:12.798 --> 28:15.402
Alright. I'll leave you be.

28:24.342 --> 28:28.444
There was a guy who...

28:28.446 --> 28:31.915
who came to hospital,
I think a few months ago,

28:31.917 --> 28:34.151
claiming he was pregnant.

28:34.153 --> 28:37.954
He was referred to us
by the psychiatric department.

28:37.956 --> 28:41.058
Did he have a belly?
A pregnant belly?

28:41.060 --> 28:42.494
He did have a belly.

28:45.196 --> 28:47.097
Was he alright?

28:47.099 --> 28:51.236
Um, yeah, he was fine.
It was just a cyst.

28:57.009 --> 29:01.214
- Is Elsie gonna be alright?
- You're worried about Elsie?

29:02.414 --> 29:03.516
You're not?

29:05.150 --> 29:08.318
I think she's gonna be fine.

29:08.320 --> 29:11.323
The group just needs
to stay focused, stay together.

29:17.428 --> 29:19.932
Do you think Joey
is getting back at us?

29:21.466 --> 29:23.399
Joey is dead, sweetheart.

29:23.401 --> 29:25.437
You have to get your head
around that.

29:29.440 --> 29:32.408
You sound like Edward.

29:32.410 --> 29:34.446
I'm sorry.

29:37.850 --> 29:41.987
I think we are going to get to
the bottom of whatever this is.

29:43.355 --> 29:45.492
- If we don't?
- We will.

29:47.392 --> 29:48.560
Beth?

29:51.597 --> 29:52.866
Beth?

29:54.132 --> 29:55.367
What if we're not?

30:00.205 --> 30:02.574
There you go. Good as new.

30:29.501 --> 30:31.503
Oh, come on!

31:00.398 --> 31:02.334
It's a closed system.

31:03.534 --> 31:05.537
- You what?
- Nothing.

31:11.243 --> 31:14.179
Don't suppose there's any beer
in there, is there?

31:21.920 --> 31:23.922
Apparently not.

31:26.358 --> 31:28.161
What's a closed system?

31:29.360 --> 31:32.197
Nothing. I'm just being silly.

31:34.233 --> 31:36.098
- Sorry.
- It's alright.

31:36.100 --> 31:38.370
It's not like
I can feel anything.

31:39.538 --> 31:41.704
Any beer?

31:41.706 --> 31:44.878
- Apparently not.
- Really?

31:49.747 --> 31:53.282
We should probably
ration the food.

31:53.284 --> 31:57.053
We don't know how long
this situation is gonna last.

31:57.055 --> 31:59.088
There's only so much
to go around.

31:59.090 --> 32:00.426
Yeah.

32:06.197 --> 32:10.535
Are you OK? Because you look
like you've seen a ghost.

32:12.236 --> 32:16.341
Of course not.
No such thing as ghosts.

32:21.714 --> 32:23.715
Eddy was onto you.

32:38.062 --> 32:40.065
Champagne it is, then.

32:52.410 --> 32:54.511
Fuck it.

32:54.513 --> 32:57.716
It's a poor excuse for a bottle
of beer anyway, innit, mate?

33:09.794 --> 33:11.761
- Hey.
- Hey.

33:11.763 --> 33:15.197
Um, what do you say we...

33:15.199 --> 33:18.434
we get everyone together
and think this through?

33:18.436 --> 33:22.239
Yeah, OK. How's Ray?

33:22.241 --> 33:24.574
Oh, she'll be fine.

33:24.576 --> 33:27.844
She'll be fine.
She'll be down in a minute.

33:27.846 --> 33:30.246
She's gotta get
her head together,

33:30.248 --> 33:32.382
around all this, like we all do.

33:32.384 --> 33:35.719
OK. Alright,
I'll be down in a second.

33:35.721 --> 33:37.521
OK, I'll get Elsie and Jaan.

33:37.523 --> 33:39.524
- Beth?
- Yeah?

33:42.727 --> 33:45.261
- Are you alright?
- Yeah.

33:45.263 --> 33:46.599
Yeah?

33:51.602 --> 33:54.471
What if the, uh...

33:54.473 --> 33:57.143
What if the tattoos go up
when you hurt someone?

34:00.279 --> 34:01.681
What do you mean?

34:08.087 --> 34:09.422
Come here.

34:22.734 --> 34:25.605
We're not a good match, Mike.

34:30.109 --> 34:32.145
Isn't that the beauty of it,
though?

34:36.114 --> 34:38.216
The doctor-patient thing.

34:40.485 --> 34:41.621
Alright.

34:46.725 --> 34:49.161
Hang on. I wasn't the patient.

34:50.161 --> 34:51.460
Mmm.

34:51.462 --> 34:54.199
- Well, group therapy, then.
- Right.

34:57.469 --> 34:59.739
It's not always about you, Mike.

35:17.656 --> 35:19.859
That's better than therapy,
innit?

35:24.795 --> 35:26.098
True.

35:28.567 --> 35:30.235
Better than therapy.

36:07.505 --> 36:10.576
Hey, you wanna join us?

36:13.212 --> 36:15.313
Yes, please.

36:18.449 --> 36:22.955
I'm sorry... about Ray.
I... I don't know what...

36:27.558 --> 36:29.793
Listen, it happened.

36:29.795 --> 36:31.797
You lost control, huh?

36:35.500 --> 36:38.471
Well, us girls
need to stick together, right?

36:44.275 --> 36:46.279
I'll see you in there.

37:22.514 --> 37:24.313
Come on, you know I was right.

37:24.315 --> 37:26.351
Don't act like
I pissed on your chips.

37:27.386 --> 37:29.585
I'm not. I'm thinking.

37:29.587 --> 37:31.987
I'm just trying
to get a grip on this.

37:31.989 --> 37:35.991
We're gonna calmly discuss this
and work it out step by step.

37:35.993 --> 37:37.996
I'm here. Just two seconds.

37:40.598 --> 37:44.433
- Is something wrong, Elsie?
- Yes. No.

37:44.435 --> 37:46.302
Can we get on with this, please?

37:46.304 --> 37:48.471
We're waiting for Ray.
She'll be down in a minute.

37:48.473 --> 37:49.572
She had to get something.

37:49.574 --> 37:51.675
I totally didn't think of this.

37:51.677 --> 37:53.342
I carry this thing
everywhere with me.

37:53.344 --> 37:55.311
- And?
- I'll connect to the internet.

37:55.313 --> 37:56.545
No!

37:56.547 --> 37:59.449
- What?
- No.

37:59.451 --> 38:01.918
I felt it. The number went down.

38:01.920 --> 38:06.623
Fuck. You knew
that was gonna happen.

38:06.625 --> 38:10.326
- You've figured this out.
- No, I haven't.

38:10.328 --> 38:13.362
Did you see
the way she reacted?

38:13.364 --> 38:15.764
You're acting
like you know something.

38:15.766 --> 38:17.833
Are you kidding?

38:17.835 --> 38:20.804
- It was a feeling.
- Feeling?

38:20.806 --> 38:24.607
Well, every time we reach
for help, we get... punished.

38:24.609 --> 38:28.578
Yeah, but it wasn't us that got
punished, was it? It was Ray.

38:28.580 --> 38:32.514
Because you didn't share your
feelings with the rest of us.

38:32.516 --> 38:36.119
She's on two fucking points.

38:36.121 --> 38:40.523
You're gonna get us all killed.
Or is that what you want?

38:40.525 --> 38:43.559
Yes, Jaan,
that's exactly what I want.

38:43.561 --> 38:45.829
- Relax.
- Relax? Fuck off!

38:45.831 --> 38:50.032
- Don't tell me what to do.
- Stop it, Jaan, please.

38:50.034 --> 38:55.340
We just need to work this out
together, before... before I...

38:56.507 --> 38:58.511
before something...

39:00.545 --> 39:03.112
Well, I don't know anything,

39:03.114 --> 39:07.386
but it seems as though
there are rules to this.

39:10.688 --> 39:12.554
Well, enlighten us.

39:12.556 --> 39:13.892
One.

39:15.527 --> 39:17.460
Leaving the house

39:17.462 --> 39:22.398
or attempting to contact
the outside world in any way

39:22.400 --> 39:23.935
gets penalized.

39:25.036 --> 39:26.706
Yeah, seems about right.

39:27.639 --> 39:28.871
OK, well, that's one.

39:28.873 --> 39:31.808
- What's next?
- OK. Two.

39:31.810 --> 39:34.580
And this is highly conjectural.

39:36.882 --> 39:41.550
It seems as though,
for lack of a better word,

39:41.552 --> 39:47.123
the tattoo points form
some sort of limited resource

39:47.125 --> 39:50.226
that we may be able
to redistribute.

39:50.228 --> 39:52.561
Now, the keyword here
is "limited."

39:52.563 --> 39:54.463
What?

39:54.465 --> 39:58.034
We can't afford to lose
any more from the pool.

39:58.036 --> 40:01.471
Wait. Turn back.
Redistribute? How?

40:01.473 --> 40:05.241
OK, this is just guesswork.

40:05.243 --> 40:07.811
But when Elsie hurt your arm,

40:07.813 --> 40:10.947
it looks like the point you lost
wasn't actually lost

40:10.949 --> 40:12.952
but transferred over to her.

40:17.855 --> 40:19.087
So you're saying it's possible

40:19.089 --> 40:21.891
to get Ray's points
back up, then?

40:21.893 --> 40:25.527
- Yes, but...
- At the cost of someone else.

40:25.529 --> 40:27.532
It's the tragedy of the commons.

40:32.270 --> 40:33.605
OK.

40:38.076 --> 40:41.543
So how do we proceed
from here, then?

40:41.545 --> 40:43.880
I think we need a leader.

40:43.882 --> 40:46.014
If you're right
about these rules,

40:46.016 --> 40:48.518
then we need someone
in control of the points.

40:48.520 --> 40:49.788
Why?

40:51.656 --> 40:54.824
Maybe if we'd had someone
in charge before,

40:54.826 --> 40:56.558
I would have asked
about the tablet

40:56.560 --> 41:00.532
and I wouldn't be
in this position.

41:03.502 --> 41:06.268
OK. So let's... let's vote.

41:06.270 --> 41:08.003
No.

41:08.005 --> 41:11.944
It should be you.
It has to be Beth.

41:13.911 --> 41:17.212
You're smart and you know
how to deal with stress.

41:17.214 --> 41:19.148
Her? She's been
keeping things from us.

41:19.150 --> 41:22.888
Jaan! I don't want to die.

41:23.889 --> 41:25.654
You're not gonna die.

41:25.656 --> 41:30.696
We do need a leader.
I accept Beth.

41:31.630 --> 41:33.061
I'll follow your lead.

41:33.063 --> 41:35.230
Have you all lost your minds?

41:35.232 --> 41:36.835
Shh!

41:43.975 --> 41:46.645
Please. For me.

41:52.116 --> 41:53.284
Fine.

41:59.790 --> 42:03.159
- What?
- What do you mean, what?

42:03.161 --> 42:05.164
Are you on board or aren't you?

42:08.333 --> 42:09.201
No.

42:11.703 --> 42:14.270
Like I said before,
I'm too old for games

42:14.272 --> 42:16.007
and that includes
Follow the Leader.

42:18.143 --> 42:20.342
I think we should
approach this as adults

42:20.344 --> 42:23.047
capable of making decisions
for ourselves.

42:25.282 --> 42:27.252
But whatever works for you lot.

42:29.020 --> 42:31.387
Were you born
a complete fucking prick?

42:31.389 --> 42:32.725
Stop it!

42:35.927 --> 42:37.759
Enough of this bickering.
I'm done with it.

42:37.761 --> 42:39.764
We're all done with it.

42:41.632 --> 42:44.904
Now, are you putting me
in charge or not?

42:48.206 --> 42:51.644
Yes. Yes, we are.

42:53.043 --> 42:56.079
- Yes.
- Of course.

42:56.081 --> 43:00.619
OK. Alright.
Then I take the lead.

43:04.855 --> 43:06.859
It's back to six.

43:09.393 --> 43:10.728
Guys.

43:11.395 --> 43:13.565
Ray, she's...

43:15.165 --> 43:16.668
Ray?

43:25.710 --> 43:28.147
It's back to one now, isn't it?

43:31.248 --> 43:32.750
Show us.

43:37.255 --> 43:40.757
You bitch!
She's trying to kill Ray.

43:40.759 --> 43:42.891
- That's not true.
- She's lying.

43:42.893 --> 43:44.460
She's manipulating all of us.

43:44.462 --> 43:48.431
- How could I have known?
- You're not so smart.

43:48.433 --> 43:52.869
Hurt her. Ray, hurt her! Come
on. You'll get your point back.

43:52.871 --> 43:55.038
- What? No.
- Get off me!

43:55.040 --> 43:57.239
- I'm not stupid.
- Yes, she's right.

43:57.241 --> 44:00.342
- It will transfer.
- No. I can't.

44:00.344 --> 44:02.978
- I'm not like that.
- Then become like that!

44:02.980 --> 44:04.380
Have you all gone crazy?

44:04.382 --> 44:06.849
- Mike.
- Better that than dead.

44:06.851 --> 44:09.918
- What are you doing?
- Use this.

44:09.920 --> 44:11.087
What are you doing?

44:11.089 --> 44:13.121
This is not all about you, Beth.

44:13.123 --> 44:15.058
What the hell
are you talking about?

44:15.060 --> 44:17.226
Come on, Ray! Get it over with.

44:17.228 --> 44:19.762
Please, not my hand!

44:19.764 --> 44:21.431
Please, hit her.

44:21.433 --> 44:23.166
I don't want you to die.
Hit her, please.

44:23.168 --> 44:26.436
I can't do it.
It's wrong! It's wrong!

44:26.438 --> 44:30.505
She took your point.
Take it back. You're on one!

44:30.507 --> 44:33.208
I don't want to die, Beth.
I'm scared.

44:33.210 --> 44:35.210
Hit her or you will die!

44:35.212 --> 44:37.746
- I'm sorry...
- Please, not my hand.

44:37.748 --> 44:40.319
- Hit her!
- No!

44:42.319 --> 44:45.922
- Harder!
- Don't. Don't do it.

44:45.924 --> 44:47.226
Do it!

45:32.270 --> 45:35.107
Ray, Ray, Ray, Ray.

45:40.344 --> 45:42.445
I'm sorry.

45:42.447 --> 45:45.313
Hit me. Hit me.
Take one of mine.

45:45.315 --> 45:46.815
- Come on.
- Get off. Get off.

45:46.817 --> 45:48.821
- Come on.
- Get off me.

45:49.987 --> 45:51.322
Ray!

46:53.217 --> 46:56.221
Supply and demand, Eddy.

48:04.489 --> 48:06.491
So you're helping me now?

48:15.465 --> 48:19.605
- It was nothing personal.
- Nothing personal?

48:22.639 --> 48:25.676
- Yes.
- What was it, then?

48:38.221 --> 48:42.493
You taught me how to rationalize
and find a solution.

48:44.362 --> 48:46.262
Disassociate.

48:46.264 --> 48:49.098
Now, we have to find out
how these tattoos work,

48:49.100 --> 48:53.071
so... we needed an experiment.

48:54.172 --> 48:55.407
We?

48:58.241 --> 49:00.244
That's cold, Mike.

49:01.779 --> 49:04.583
Well, it's supposed to be cold.

49:08.786 --> 49:10.956
You're hilarious.

49:12.589 --> 49:14.659
You got
the most points, Beth.

49:17.328 --> 49:19.431
You know I made the right call.

49:21.598 --> 49:23.100
Maybe.

49:25.770 --> 49:27.239
I'm sorry.

49:30.574 --> 49:32.977
I really am.

49:46.357 --> 49:50.458
So did it work out the way
you expected, this experiment?

49:50.460 --> 49:51.629
No.

49:53.264 --> 49:55.463
No, it didn't.

49:55.465 --> 49:57.301
It really didn't.

50:00.103 --> 50:02.471
But it was educational, I guess.

50:02.473 --> 50:04.141
Was it educational?

50:05.342 --> 50:07.242
- Jesus, Mike.
- Oh, come...

50:07.244 --> 50:09.779
And only, what,
one more of us had to die?

50:09.781 --> 50:12.284
You know what I mean.

50:15.152 --> 50:17.388
None of us
wanted Rainbow to die.

50:29.534 --> 50:32.233
OK,
so let's talk numbers, then,

50:32.235 --> 50:33.672
see where we stand.

50:35.239 --> 50:36.441
OK.

50:38.208 --> 50:41.811
- Elsie is at her original six.
- Yeah.

50:41.813 --> 50:47.550
I have seven, and, well,
assuming Jaan got my point

50:47.552 --> 50:52.557
<i>and Ray's last one,
he's at seven too.</i>

50:54.592 --> 50:56.494
<i>No, he's at eight.</i>

50:57.728 --> 51:00.829
What? How?

51:00.831 --> 51:04.168
'Cause he took your point when
he forced you to go outside.

51:09.306 --> 51:11.308
Is this true?

51:15.480 --> 51:17.482
You hypocrite.

51:20.418 --> 51:22.650
Tell me everything you know,

51:22.652 --> 51:26.590
and don't you dare
leave anything out.

51:28.259 --> 51:30.228
I don't have to
tell you anything.

51:31.761 --> 51:34.395
You're not the boss of me.

51:34.397 --> 51:36.431
That stopped when Ray died.

51:36.433 --> 51:39.336
It clearly stopped
before she died.

51:41.471 --> 51:44.739
- What?
- That's why she died.

51:44.741 --> 51:47.845
You said you were gonna
listen to me, but you didn't.

51:49.714 --> 51:51.715
So you killed her.

51:53.183 --> 51:56.253
- You did.
- Fuck you.

52:00.458 --> 52:02.561
You call me a hypocrite.

52:04.395 --> 52:06.264
He lied about his tattoo.

52:07.431 --> 52:08.697
He doesn't have one.

52:08.699 --> 52:11.103
Then why is he still here?

52:14.404 --> 52:16.340
Why don't you just go home?

52:18.808 --> 52:20.211
You can't.

52:21.913 --> 52:26.251
Because he has a fucking tattoo
just like the rest of us.

52:28.552 --> 52:30.355
Is this true?

52:31.688 --> 52:33.190
Mike?

53:18.335 --> 53:20.337
I'm still on six.

53:24.641 --> 53:26.177
Why do you lie to me?

53:28.478 --> 53:31.512
I should never have got
a fucking tattoo.

53:31.514 --> 53:33.748
After everything
we've been through.

53:33.750 --> 53:35.953
Oh, come on, Beth, you know why.

53:39.257 --> 53:40.492
Coward.

53:44.261 --> 53:46.561
Now, I'm gonna go
and take care of...

53:46.563 --> 53:48.232
- Go.
- Wait.

53:50.935 --> 53:52.938
You need a sheet...

53:55.505 --> 53:57.542
to cover her body.

54:01.444 --> 54:03.480
Yeah, I'll get one from my room.

55:13.083 --> 55:14.886
What are you doing?

55:16.987 --> 55:19.424
Means and opportunity.

55:20.991 --> 55:24.492
- What are you talking about?
- The robbery.

55:24.494 --> 55:26.795
- You're a security tech.
- I never hid anything.

55:26.797 --> 55:28.096
You were in on it.

55:28.098 --> 55:30.866
All this time, all this therapy,

55:30.868 --> 55:32.800
all this reunion.

55:32.802 --> 55:34.505
And motive.

55:35.873 --> 55:37.509
A cancer kid.

55:39.743 --> 55:43.512
- That's mine.
- I know, yeah. I know it is.

55:43.514 --> 55:45.614
We're onto you, Eddy and I.

55:45.616 --> 55:47.815
Eddy thought you were
just an electrician,

55:47.817 --> 55:50.886
but you were there for
the alarm systems, weren't you?

55:50.888 --> 55:53.721
I know. I know.

55:53.723 --> 55:55.726
Case solved.

56:00.697 --> 56:02.701
How is this relevant?

56:04.435 --> 56:07.639
It's motive.
You needed the money.

56:08.806 --> 56:11.172
And Beth?

56:11.174 --> 56:13.474
Is Beth in on this?

56:13.476 --> 56:17.913
- Beth was...
- You'll die here, like Eddy.

56:17.915 --> 56:20.983
Or I'm gonna get you arrested,
both of you.

56:20.985 --> 56:23.388
Beth has nothing to do with it.

56:25.855 --> 56:28.757
- This was after.
- Aiding and abetting.

56:28.759 --> 56:30.992
- Hostage taking.
- No.

56:30.994 --> 56:32.594
- Accessory to murder.
- No, please.

56:32.596 --> 56:35.431
Grievous injury
with disability as a result.

56:35.433 --> 56:38.534
- Stop it.
- You lost.

56:38.536 --> 56:42.603
- You lost the game.
- Oh, my God.

56:42.605 --> 56:46.377
- This is why Eddy hated you.
- I outsmarted you.

56:50.547 --> 56:52.816
They said
no one was gonna get hurt.

56:54.518 --> 56:56.087
And how did that work out
for you?

56:59.123 --> 57:02.460
And now you have to help me.

57:03.828 --> 57:08.029
We need to collect more points,
you and I.

57:08.031 --> 57:11.902
If we get enough, we can get out
of the... out of the range.

57:16.540 --> 57:20.110
- How big's this range?
- I don't know.

57:21.679 --> 57:23.782
The tattoos
only started behaving...

57:25.815 --> 57:27.819
We need as many as we can.

57:31.255 --> 57:33.691
You didn't
think this through, mate.

57:34.891 --> 57:36.194
What do you...

59:23.266 --> 59:24.768
Fuck.

01:00:37.273 --> 01:00:38.775
OK.

01:01:14.811 --> 01:01:16.411
Um...

01:01:16.413 --> 01:01:17.915
OK.

01:03:32.583 --> 01:03:35.019
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:03:36.152 --> 01:03:39.454
- You alright?
- Yeah. Are you?

01:03:39.456 --> 01:03:42.493
Yeah. Yeah, I'm good.

01:03:44.527 --> 01:03:46.496
- I don't...
- I got the sheet.

01:03:47.496 --> 01:03:49.000
For Ray.

01:03:51.368 --> 01:03:54.371
- OK.
- I'm gonna go do that now.

01:03:55.172 --> 01:03:56.307
OK.

01:03:58.141 --> 01:04:01.979
- I'm gonna go freshen up.
- Yeah, good. Cool.

01:05:18.087 --> 01:05:19.422
OK.

01:06:10.072 --> 01:06:11.574
Shit. Fuck.

01:08:45.361 --> 01:08:49.198
Well, you ballsed that one up,
didn't you, Beth?

01:09:40.616 --> 01:09:41.783
OK.

01:09:50.794 --> 01:09:54.595
You can walk? You sick...

01:09:54.597 --> 01:09:56.600
What you said to me
downstairs...

01:10:00.003 --> 01:10:03.206
- Say it again.
- What are you talking about?

01:10:04.406 --> 01:10:07.942
Come on, say it again.

01:10:07.944 --> 01:10:09.245
I dare you!

01:11:35.065 --> 01:11:37.431
Here's J...

01:11:42.739 --> 01:11:44.674
You wanker.

01:12:40.996 --> 01:12:42.499
Beth?

01:13:26.709 --> 01:13:28.545
It was an accident.

01:13:29.445 --> 01:13:31.447
He attacked me.

01:13:42.991 --> 01:13:44.660
I'm so sorry.

01:13:48.897 --> 01:13:50.900
But this is the only way.

01:14:08.250 --> 01:14:11.454
Oh, come on, open the door.
You've got nowhere to go, Beth.

01:14:17.227 --> 01:14:21.796
Come on. Open the door, Beth.
You've got nowhere to go.

01:14:21.798 --> 01:14:23.634
Fuck you, Mike!

01:14:24.801 --> 01:14:26.736
Fucking lunatics.

01:14:29.838 --> 01:14:32.273
- 14.
- Fucking prick.

01:14:32.275 --> 01:14:34.574
Come on!

01:14:34.576 --> 01:14:37.513
You're making this so much
harder than it needs to be.

01:14:39.214 --> 01:14:41.717
Do you really think
Lilly would want this?

01:14:43.119 --> 01:14:45.121
A coward for a father?

01:14:59.002 --> 01:15:01.004
You fucking bitch.

01:16:33.829 --> 01:16:35.197
Oh, fuck.

01:16:38.735 --> 01:16:40.067
Fuck.

01:16:40.069 --> 01:16:41.571
OK.

01:16:44.173 --> 01:16:46.172
OK.

01:16:46.174 --> 01:16:48.378
See if you can stop this,
arsehole.

01:16:55.250 --> 01:16:57.820
Come on. Come on.

01:16:59.355 --> 01:17:00.787
Fuck.

01:17:00.789 --> 01:17:02.658
Shit.

01:17:04.160 --> 01:17:05.458
OK.

01:17:05.460 --> 01:17:07.697
OK. I get it.

01:17:17.173 --> 01:17:20.377
OK. Good. Good.

01:17:48.838 --> 01:17:49.840
OK.

01:17:59.481 --> 01:18:00.650
OK.

01:18:10.993 --> 01:18:11.995
OK.

01:18:16.065 --> 01:18:17.067
OK.

01:18:38.820 --> 01:18:41.490
Oh, shit the bed.

01:21:40.937 --> 01:21:42.372
Mike?

01:21:48.977 --> 01:21:50.978
Mike?

01:22:01.958 --> 01:22:03.093
Mike?

01:22:04.459 --> 01:22:06.060
<i>Can you speak slower?</i>

01:22:06.062 --> 01:22:08.061
<i>There's one man down.</i>

01:22:08.063 --> 01:22:09.595
<i>Two men down.</i>

01:22:16.972 --> 01:22:18.973
<i>...possible spinal injury.</i>

01:22:18.975 --> 01:22:20.674
<i>He's been shot in the back.</i>

01:22:20.676 --> 01:22:22.242
<i>Do you need
medical assistance?</i>

01:22:22.244 --> 01:22:24.577
<i>Yes, yes, yes.</i>

01:22:24.579 --> 01:22:28.716
<i>We're gonna need
immediate attention to...</i>

01:22:28.718 --> 01:22:30.617
<i>Hang on...</i>

01:22:30.619 --> 01:22:32.318
<i>No. No.</i>

01:23:39.789 --> 01:23:43.626
Oh, Jesus Christ, Beth,
you really are a piece of work.

01:25:07.676 --> 01:25:09.643
It's OK.

01:25:09.645 --> 01:25:11.778
I've got you.

01:25:11.780 --> 01:25:16.453
I've got you.
I've got you. It's OK.

01:25:23.959 --> 01:25:25.695
I need to get out of this house.

01:25:27.829 --> 01:25:29.832
I need to get home to Lilly.

01:25:33.435 --> 01:25:34.704
And I need your points.

01:25:36.638 --> 01:25:38.805
So that I can get
far enough away from this house

01:25:38.807 --> 01:25:40.674
before they run out.

01:25:40.676 --> 01:25:42.344
Do you understand?

01:26:23.953 --> 01:26:24.954
No.

01:26:28.523 --> 01:26:30.160
Oh, my God.

01:27:16.338 --> 01:27:18.441
I'm coming home, Lilly.

01:27:22.511 --> 01:27:23.946
Beth?

01:27:27.850 --> 01:27:29.485
Beth?

01:30:52.754 --> 01:30:54.857
I think this is the place.
