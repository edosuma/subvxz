00:16.474 --> 00:18.893
Will was facing a lot of time

- Lucia.

I'm doing a Cajun feast
for this fundraiser.

09:42.290 --> 09:43.708
I will make
a tutorial for that.

09:51.841 --> 09:52.801

over and over again.</i>

09:52.842 --> 09:54.260
Okay, fine.

09:54.302 --> 09:56.805
I will figure out
something to create some buzz.

09:56.846 --> 09:58.556

10:42.976 --> 10:44.644
it's not like I believe them.

10:44.686 --> 10:49.274
My mom being gone wasn't
the dawn of anything good.

10:49.315 --> 10:50.692
The only people
who might think that

10:50.734 --> 10:52.152

10:53.653 --> 10:56.614
Your dad was devastated
when he lost your mom.

10:56.656 --> 10:57.991
Yeah, maybe then.

10:58.033 --> 11:00.702
But now they're having a baby.

11:00.744 --> 11:02.037
And they told me
when the baby comes,

11:02.078 --> 11:03.371
they're gonna move
into a new house.

11:03.413 --> 11:06.750
And it's like Angela is trying
to erase my mom...

11:06.791 --> 11:08.293
- Hey, hey, hey.
- From our lives.

11:08.335 --> 11:11.546

11:48.708 --> 11:51.211
Losing Gayle was like
losing another sister.

12:00.595 --> 12:02.806
So Gayle became
like a sister to Mom

12:02.847 --> 12:04.182
when Mom and Aunt Vy
stopped talking.

12:04.224 --> 12:06.518
Okay, but why
did Mom and Aunt Vy

12:06.559 --> 12:08.395
stop talking to each other?
- I don't know.

12:08.436 --> 12:10.355
But if I had to guess, it had
to do with Will because--

12:10.397 --> 12:12.565
Hey, girls,
let's drop it, okay?

12:14.359 --> 12:16.111
Okay.

12:16.152 --> 12:18.196

- Yeah. Yeah.

12:40.051 --> 12:42.345
Yeah, me too.
Geoffrey's looking into it.

12:42.387 --> 12:44.347
However, your mother doesn't
need to be concerned with this,

12:44.389 --> 12:47.600
so let's just keep this
between ourselves, all right?

12:47.642 --> 12:49.269

before I left.

13:12.917 --> 13:14.461
Cool. See you later.

13:16.004 --> 13:17.422
Okay, what's up with you?

13:24.804 --> 13:26.389
Nothing. I just know
today's tough for you,

13:26.431 --> 13:28.850
so I wanna give you your space.

13:28.892 --> 13:31.936
Plus, I see you and Carlton
are booed up again, so...

13:31.978 --> 13:33.271
Are you serious right now?

13:33.313 --> 13:35.398
Serious as whatever
that was over there.

13:35.440 --> 13:37.984
I was upset about my mom.

13:38.985 --> 13:40.904
And he was comforting me, Will.

13:40.945 --> 13:43.698
Lisa, I-I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, I didn't realize--

13:43.740 --> 13:45.742
Can we get through one day
without you making it

13:45.784 --> 13:46.951
about some petty bullshit
between you and him?

13:46.993 --> 13:48.411
I know. I know.
I just--I figured--

13:48.453 --> 13:50.872
You're right.
Today is tough.

13:51.706 --> 13:56.211
So maybe giving me that space
sounds like a pretty good idea.

13:58.838 --> 14:01.007
Lisa.

14:34.040 --> 14:36.418
- Hey.
- Oh, my goodness.

14:38.503 --> 14:40.964
Ooh.

14:41.006 --> 14:42.382
Girl, I hope
you can breathe now.

14:42.424 --> 14:44.050
Everything's going great.

14:44.092 --> 14:47.470
Yeah, well, everything came
together by the grace of God.

14:47.512 --> 14:49.723
And the silent auction is
already off to a great start.

14:49.764 --> 14:52.851
I see the luxury yacht tour
is already up to 30K.

14:52.892 --> 14:54.269
What?

14:54.310 --> 14:55.937
And I am going to bid
on the Hawaii package.

14:55.979 --> 14:57.731
So hands off.

14:57.772 --> 14:59.357
Girl, you can stop
looking for Geoffrey.

14:59.399 --> 15:01.192
He's not even here today.

15:01.234 --> 15:02.902
Damn.

15:02.944 --> 15:04.195
Well, then I guess I'm lucky

15:04.237 --> 15:06.740
that I brought Reid
along to look at.

15:06.781 --> 15:08.491
Oh.

15:08.533 --> 15:11.161

15:24.090 --> 15:25.967
This is an amazing event.

15:26.009 --> 15:29.179

outdone yourself again, Viv.

15:29.220 --> 15:32.766
Well, you know it is
for a good cause.

Romario and Lucia?

playing piano?

16:13.014 --> 16:14.641

- All right.

25:30.363 --> 25:32.907
but instead,

25:32.949 --> 25:34.701
once again,
she's making it all about her.

It's, like, always all about
Angela, Angela, Angela.

25:37.829 --> 25:39.873

- No, no.

Trust me, I get you.

25:41.624 --> 25:43.335
It sucks to be reminded

to be angry...

25:49.716 --> 25:51.217

onto those good memories

26:06.107 --> 26:08.735

I guess, but...

26:15.825 --> 26:18.119
Honestly,

26:18.161 --> 26:20.663
I think Carlton
uses my vulnerability

26:20.705 --> 26:22.999
as a way to get closer to me.

26:23.041 --> 26:25.335
Tiptoeing around his emotions
is exhausting,

through my own shit

26:30.131 --> 26:32.300
without trying to navigate his.

someone to be petty with

35:04.479 --> 35:06.981
My mom loved poetry.

35:07.023 --> 35:09.317
Maya Angelou, Langston Hughes.

35:09.359 --> 35:11.486
And my mama
loved her some Tupac.

35:13.071 --> 35:17.200
Towards the end of her life,
I read to her a lot of poetry

35:17.242 --> 35:19.244
because she said
that it eased her pain.

35:19.285 --> 35:22.497
And after she passed,
I started writing poetry

35:22.539 --> 35:25.417
because it eased my pain
about saying goodbye to her

35:25.458 --> 35:31.256
as a tribute to her
and her memory.

35:32.799 --> 35:36.678
So even though I had planned
on reading a different poem,

35:36.720 --> 35:38.680
I thought it'd be fitting
for me to read the words

35:38.722 --> 35:41.683
that I wrote for my mom.

35:41.725 --> 35:46.354

the world, Mom.
