00:04.550 --> 00:06.000
Hey,guys.Let's take these seats back here.

00:06.100 --> 00:07.740
Then we can make a quick exit.

00:11.050 --> 00:13.460
Joe,come on.Hey,guys.

00:14.150 --> 00:15.430
Joe,not in front.

00:16.400 --> 00:18.070
Can I help you,mrs. Dubois?

00:19.580 --> 00:21.060
Uh,I don't think so.

00:24.850 --> 00:27.230
Oh,I didn't realize that so one had passed away.

00:28.230 --> 00:31.900
I'm not really fond of funerals.
I deal with death a lot in my work.

00:31.950 --> 00:32.930
Me,too.

00:34.420 --> 00:38.320
Truth be told,these things are really more
for the family than for the deceased.

00:38.530 --> 00:40.310
I suppose so. You're right.

00:40.680 --> 00:43.670
Gives everyone a sense of closure,
an opportunity to say good-bye,

00:44.070 --> 00:46.430
creates an atmosphere of civility and control

00:46.500 --> 00:47.800
i think people find comforting

00:47.910 --> 00:52.360
when faced with the sudden
and sometimes random reality of death.

00:52.360 --> 00:53.900
So.

00:54.680 --> 00:55.900
Here we are

00:57.000 --> 01:03.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:07.250 --> 01:12.140
I think... now would be an excellent time
for you to take your place,allison.

02:22.800 --> 02:24.110
Do we have a current will?

02:26.160 --> 02:28.340
You know,a will.For when people die.

02:35.160 --> 02:37.710
Suddenly it's becoming very clear.

02:38.740 --> 02:40.650
The sleep deprivation.

02:42.230 --> 02:43.550
You're trying to kill me.

02:43.670 --> 02:44.890
I'm serious.

02:46.740 --> 02:49.180
okay.Let me put your mind at ease.

02:49.830 --> 02:51.010
We have a current will.

02:51.770 --> 02:53.850
We also have a mortgage.

02:53.890 --> 02:55.540
We also have a mound of debt.

02:56.270 --> 03:00.730
And should I die before you,
all that becomes yours.

03:01.570 --> 03:02.580
What about the kids?

03:02.720 --> 03:04.050
I'll throw them in as well.

03:04.710 --> 03:06.510
But... what if it's me?

03:07.240 --> 03:08.790
What if I go first?

03:09.590 --> 03:10.840
Allison,stop it.

03:11.600 --> 03:12.750
You're not going anywhere.

03:12.820 --> 03:13.820
How do you know?

03:15.010 --> 03:15.600
All right.

03:16.810 --> 03:18.450
You win.I'll play.

03:19.730 --> 03:20.760
I don't know.

03:21.820 --> 03:22.850
You feel better?

03:23.040 --> 03:23.660
I don'T.

03:24.550 --> 03:27.950
And for what it's worth,
I'm not enjoying this conversation.

03:29.560 --> 03:30.530
Why are you mad?

03:30.610 --> 03:31.130
I don't know.

03:31.270 --> 03:34.250
Cause I think maybe conversations like
this are a waste of time.

03:34.610 --> 03:36.120
We have a will,we have some insurance.

03:36.440 --> 03:38.320
We have kids we have to get up and go to school.

03:39.490 --> 03:40.810
No,I'm just being silly.

03:41.190 --> 03:43.010
No,you're not silly,but,just...

03:43.770 --> 03:45.870
don't you think if it was really your time to go,

03:46.340 --> 03:49.140
that maybe you'd get some kind of
a heads up from the universe?

03:49.530 --> 03:50.490
Like what?

03:50.960 --> 03:52.390
I don't know. A dream.

03:55.630 --> 03:56.880
can I get a cell phone?

03:57.530 --> 03:59.040
No. Why not?

03:59.850 --> 04:01.630
Because they're very expensive.

04:01.970 --> 04:03.360
They're not allowed in school.

04:04.250 --> 04:05.690
And besides,who are you going to call?

04:06.120 --> 04:07.260
She could call me.

04:07.420 --> 04:08.640
Bridge.

04:09.580 --> 04:10.980
Well,then,can I get a pager?

04:11.490 --> 04:15.430
No. Also expensive,also not allowed.

04:16.420 --> 04:18.079
And who are you going to page?

04:18.320 --> 04:21.050
I don't know,but can I at least
get a computer in my room?

04:22.950 --> 04:25.200
You're batting three for three,sweetie.

04:26.300 --> 04:28.520
Well,you asked me what i wanted for my birthday.

04:28.760 --> 04:30.100
Ask for a trampoline.

04:30.710 --> 04:31.890
How about a watch?

04:32.530 --> 04:33.430
You're gonna be 13.

04:33.530 --> 04:35.150
Couldn't you use a nice,pretty watch?

04:35.400 --> 04:38.020
Maybe,but if I had a phone,
I wouldn't need a watch.

04:39.120 --> 04:40.670
What about the computer right here?

04:41.210 --> 04:44.300
Okay,fine.Can I at least
get my own private e-mail?

04:45.140 --> 04:47.530
I think that's something  we can talk about...

04:50.030 --> 04:53.490
...tonight or tomorrow,maybe next week.

04:53.820 --> 04:56.070
Look at that.Time to get ready for school.

04:56.760 --> 04:58.830
Darn,these things are handy.

04:59.450 --> 05:02.900
There's a woman in the conference room
with detective scanlon,a mrs. Sondra bannister.

05:03.260 --> 05:06.340
Her husband,dean,is an oncologist   at mariposa memorial.

05:06.540 --> 05:09.860
Hasn't been seen since he left the hospital
yesterday evening around 6:00

05:10.030 --> 05:15.030
ok,but don't we usually insist that people wait at
least 24 hours before filing a missing persons report?

05:15.080 --> 05:18.070
Well,usually,the people doing the filing
aren't related to a sitting judge.

05:18.760 --> 05:21.520
Sondra is the daughter of
the honorable henry minder.

05:22.240 --> 05:24.900
I know you think i'm being premature,but...

05:25.780 --> 05:27.100
dean is a creature of habit

05:27.240 --> 05:30.810
and he is compulsive about
keeping his appointments

05:30.920 --> 05:32.770
He's already missed two patients this morning.

05:32.850 --> 05:36.170
It's just...it's-it's not like him
to-to not come home

05:36.270 --> 05:40.760
To not call,not call me,not call the office.

05:41.080 --> 05:44.610
Let's begin at the beginning.
He left the hospital at 6:00 A.M.

05:45.230 --> 05:50.510
He has a standing racquetball game at the club,
every tuesday night for about a year now.

05:50.780 --> 05:51.890
Who with?

06:01.850 --> 06:04.730
Detective scanlon will call the club and figure out  where he was supposed to be,

06:04.800 --> 06:06.080
who he was supposed to be with.

06:07.780 --> 06:10.330
Does your husband have a medical condition?

06:10.450 --> 06:12.870
Is it possible he could  be incapacitated somewhere?

06:13.270 --> 06:14.900
Not that I'm aware of.

06:16.940 --> 06:18.570
he's a doctor. I would konw

06:22.580 --> 06:24.600
No,this is all wrong.

06:25.110 --> 06:26.290
Something'shappened to him.

06:29.490 --> 06:32.990
Dr. Bannister.Ready to do a little business?

06:36.030 --> 06:37.290
The angel of death.

06:37.910 --> 06:39.340
Well,he didn't say that.

06:39.370 --> 06:41.280
He didn't actually announce himself.

06:42.190 --> 06:45.220
But I know that's what he stands for,I know that's what he represents.

06:46.350 --> 06:48.190
And you know this... how?

06:48.990 --> 06:51.980
Well,I've seen him before in my dreams.  This is not the first time.

06:52.080 --> 06:53.000
I see.

06:54.320 --> 06:59.000
And these prior appearances have all   preceded the discovery of someone who perished?

07:01.630 --> 07:02.770
Allison...

07:03.610 --> 07:06.530
the man's been out of touch less than a day,

07:06.730 --> 07:09.410
and while I have enormous respect   for your intuition--

07:09.420 --> 07:11.290
I am the one who asked you to be in that meeting--

07:12.240 --> 07:14.090
I'd prefer not to jump the gun here.

07:16.110 --> 07:18.500
sorry to interrupt,but I thought you  might want to hear this.

07:19.220 --> 07:22.820
When I got back to my desk there was a message  waiting  from commerce general bank.

07:22.820 --> 07:25.030
Still no action on the good doctor's credit cards,

07:25.150 --> 07:29.930
but they did run a quick check on this   other finances and discovered something a bit unusual.

07:30.760 --> 07:31.720
For instance?

07:31.930 --> 07:33.150
No withdrawals,

07:33.180 --> 07:37.070
but a lot of cash deposits  over the past year or so,pretty near once a week

07:37.200 --> 07:38.710
12 grand here,16 grand there.

07:39.340 --> 07:41.090
Not enough to trip any bank alarms.

07:41.520 --> 07:43.870
But it all added up to about a million dollars.

07:45.520 --> 07:46.420
Okay.Gets better.

07:46.870 --> 07:49.480
Unlike their other accounts,which are in the name of mr. And mrs.,

07:50.530 --> 07:53.210
This is dr. Bannister's and dr. Bannister's alone.

07:54.240 --> 07:56.550
I don't understand.What could that mean?

07:57.020 --> 07:59.300
It could mean he's been saving   up for a disappearing act.

08:00.830 --> 08:02.190
This is allison dubois.

08:02.470 --> 08:03.550
I'm marie's mother.

08:03.610 --> 08:06.080
Can you hear me?I'm having a difficult time hearing you.

08:12.650 --> 08:14.750
I'm gonna be there in about 20 minutes. Can you...?

08:41.620 --> 08:45.310
Hello.Anybody home?In here!

08:47.720 --> 08:48.940
Good evening,ladies.

08:50.650 --> 08:53.230
Girls,can you give dad and me a minute,please?

09:04.430 --> 09:05.450
Okay,who died?

09:06.540 --> 09:08.190
That's a terrible choice of words.

09:09.510 --> 09:10.340
why? What?

09:10.630 --> 09:12.060
Did someone actually die?

09:12.490 --> 09:14.680
No,not actually. Not yet.

09:17.910 --> 09:21.110
Remember that conversation that we were having this morning?

09:21.620 --> 09:23.190
What to get ariel for her birthday?

09:23.370 --> 09:25.830
No. I was asking you about wills.

09:28.060 --> 09:29.420
Well,I had this dream last night.

09:30.120 --> 09:31.810
I saw my own death.

09:32.690 --> 09:33.720
Well,not my death.

09:36.320 --> 09:37.530
My own funeral.

09:38.550 --> 09:41.460
And you were all there,and I was there. And it...

09:41.590 --> 09:42.380
okay.

09:44.470 --> 09:46.080
It was a dream,allison.

09:46.700 --> 09:49.720
And even you have dreams that are just dreams.

09:51.250 --> 09:53.250
Obviously you're not dead.

09:55.150 --> 09:57.940
I think we have to let this one go,allison.

09:58.080 --> 10:02.240
This afternoon I came this close  to plowing into a huge truck.

10:04.150 --> 10:08.340
Well,no... actually,a huge truck came this  close to plowing into me.

10:09.920 --> 10:12.570
I was a fraction of an inch away from death,joe.

10:12.780 --> 10:14.000
Wait a second. For real?

10:14.000 --> 10:14.850
Yes.

10:15.060 --> 10:16.050
I mean,I'm fine.

10:16.160 --> 10:18.730
There are no cuts or bruises. The car's fine.

10:21.370 --> 10:23.540
But I was inches away from death.

10:24.080 --> 10:25.990
Okay,that's called a coincidence.

10:26.000 --> 10:28.840
A very scary,very unsettling coincidence.

10:28.870 --> 10:29.610
I don't know.

10:31.510 --> 10:33.060
There was this man in my dream.

10:34.660 --> 10:36.400
He was the only person who could see me.

10:37.380 --> 10:38.410
What do you mean? What man?

10:38.790 --> 10:39.460
'Cause I was dead.

10:39.610 --> 10:43.200
So you couldn't see me,the girls  couldn't see me,but he could see me.

10:44.360 --> 10:46.660
He seemed to know all about it.

10:46.790 --> 10:48.120
He seemed to be running everything.

10:48.800 --> 10:49.720
I don't follow.

10:50.620 --> 10:52.020
Death.

10:52.820 --> 10:53.780
Death.

10:54.310 --> 10:57.330
He was in charge of death.

10:59.390 --> 11:03.180
He was death.The angel of death.

11:05.710 --> 11:06.360
Okay.

11:07.570 --> 11:09.520
Again,this was a dream,allison

11:09.690 --> 11:11.640
And not a realistic dream,obviously.

11:12.720 --> 11:15.120
Now,that's what I thought.Or that's what I hoped.

11:16.720 --> 11:19.340
But then this thing happens with the truck.

11:20.170 --> 11:23.560
And I turn...and he's there.

11:24.690 --> 11:26.700
Standing on the corner looking at his watch

11:26.760 --> 11:29.950
like he had a schedule and I was on his to-do list.

11:32.100 --> 11:32.850
Okay,

11:34.640 --> 11:35.890
you were in shock

11:36.390 --> 11:38.200
You may still be in shock.

11:38.390 --> 11:39.460
He was trying to tell me something.

11:39.670 --> 11:41.320
I mean,not with words...

11:42.480 --> 11:43.550
but it was like...

11:46.970 --> 11:48.880
"time up,allison. Prepare."

11:57.090 --> 12:00.220
I mean,it's funny that I vaguely  remember leaving the scene.

12:00.320 --> 12:05.030
I barely remember picking the girls up from school.

12:06.860 --> 12:07.900
I just...

12:09.110 --> 12:12.970
I remember getting home,going into the room,

12:13.440 --> 12:16.600
closing the door,and starting to sob.

12:17.700 --> 12:21.710
And swearing to myself i would never drive again.

12:29.470 --> 12:30.870
It's okay,it's okay.

12:32.070 --> 12:33.770
we're going to figure this out,all right?

12:34.420 --> 12:35.480
It's going to be okay.

12:42.680 --> 12:43.670
hey,it's 10:00.

12:45.280 --> 12:46.310
five more minutes?

12:46.680 --> 12:47.230
Yeah.

12:47.660 --> 12:50.310
Is mommy feeling better?

12:51.660 --> 12:53.720
I don't know.I think so.She's asleep.

12:54.300 --> 12:56.170
She had a pretty big scare today.

12:56.570 --> 12:58.200
But I'm sure she's going to get over it.

12:59.330 --> 13:04.340
You guys probably didn't have a chance to talk about any of the stuff i mentioned at breakfast.

13:07.200 --> 13:09.920
I'll tell you what,I'm going to make an executive decision here.

13:10.240 --> 13:12.600
And I'm sure that mommy's going to be fine with it.

13:13.690 --> 13:17.190
Tomorrow or the next day,we'll get you started on your own e-mail account...

13:22.520 --> 13:23.740
okay,here's the thing.

13:24.940 --> 13:27.410
Mommy and I are going to have full access.

13:28.150 --> 13:29.770
We're both going to know your password.

13:30.090 --> 13:31.670
We'll be able to check your e-mails,

13:31.690 --> 13:33.640
we'll be able to check your trash.

13:34.360 --> 13:37.240
Okay,daddy. I promise you won't be disappointed.

13:37.490 --> 13:38.780
Okay,I'm counting on you.

13:40.500 --> 13:42.920
This is the best birthday present ever.

13:43.100 --> 13:44.210
Well,don't say that.

13:44.530 --> 13:47.580
Don't say that till you've had your birthday and seen your other presents.

13:47.940 --> 13:49.780
You know,they make these clocks now--

13:50.020 --> 13:51.900
you can actually wear them on your wrist.

13:54.940 --> 13:56.560
Good night,sweetie. Good night,daddy.

13:57.620 --> 13:58.690
Five minutes.

14:03.010 --> 14:04.010
oh,hello,allison.

14:04.510 --> 14:06.080
Good to see you again.Please come in.

14:06.880 --> 14:07.580
Take a seat

14:08.520 --> 14:12.900
Clearly we are destined to do some business together,given the way we keep crossing paths.

14:14.510 --> 14:16.270
Oh,heavens... you look disappointed.

14:17.880 --> 14:20.170
Might I suggest that you simply surrender to the idea.

14:20.340 --> 14:22.030
It's inevitable,I'm afraid.

14:23.780 --> 14:24.590
How do I know?

14:25.940 --> 14:30.470
Allison,like it or not,by a hair,by a second,

14:31.260 --> 14:34.120
by luck,by fate,six times a day

14:34.140 --> 14:37.660
you come this close to meeting  the god to whom you pray.

14:37.960 --> 14:40.720
Sometimes you sense it,like today when you managed to avoid that truck.

14:41.340 --> 14:44.460
But more often than not,you have no idea just how close you've come to...

14:45.920 --> 14:47.140
bathroom?

14:49.120 --> 14:49.970
Right outside.

14:50.250 --> 14:51.950
Through the waiting room and to the left.

14:52.640 --> 14:56.060
Be careful.Bathrooms can be very dangerous places.

14:56.380 --> 14:59.840
Did you know that 47% of all accidental deaths take place in the home

14:59.990 --> 15:03.570
and that 61% of those happen in the family bathroom?

15:05.420 --> 15:06.000
that's all right.

15:06.020 --> 15:07.050
You go ahead,I'll get that.

15:10.530 --> 15:11.560
what's going on?

15:11.920 --> 15:12.430
Hello.

15:13.310 --> 15:14.750
Allison,it's manuel devalos.

15:14.850 --> 15:16.830
Sorry to wake you at this ungodly hour,

15:16.900 --> 15:21.140
but I just got a call that a body was  discovered at the viceroy motel downtown

15:21.240 --> 15:24.510
that matches the general description of  dr. Dean bannister.

15:25.860 --> 15:27.190
I'm on my way over there now.

15:27.880 --> 15:28.910
Do you want to meet me there?

15:30.760 --> 15:34.000
I... I don't know.Drive downtown.

15:34.710 --> 15:35.920
Would it help if I picked you up?

15:36.900 --> 15:38.480
I can run the kids to school.

15:40.130 --> 15:41.240
That would be great.

15:44.510 --> 15:47.230
It's him.Wallet was still in his pants.

15:47.340 --> 15:49.400
All his id plus about 400 bucks.

15:50.860 --> 15:52.070
So we're not looking at robbery.

15:52.610 --> 15:54.590
I'm not sure we're looking at foul play of any kind.

15:54.990 --> 15:56.380
They found the body in there.

15:56.740 --> 15:57.620
In the bathroom?

15:59.150 --> 16:01.400
You'd be amazed at how treacherous  bathrooms can be.

16:01.530 --> 16:02.520
No. I've heard.

16:03.470 --> 16:04.480
Appears as though he slipped in the shower,

16:05.020 --> 16:06.970
cracked his skull on the bathtub spigot.

16:07.290 --> 16:09.690
He's been laying in there for hours with  the water running on him.

16:10.160 --> 16:11.110
The maid found him.

16:11.200 --> 16:12.630
Anybody talk to the desk clerk?

16:12.950 --> 16:13.860
That's where it gets interesting.

16:14.150 --> 16:19.080
Apparently,dr. Bannister checked into the hotel at 7:00 the night before last... alone.

16:19.510 --> 16:21.060
Just like he did every tuesday.

16:21.420 --> 16:24.620
Paid cash.Signed an illegible signature on the id card.

16:25.270 --> 16:27.480
So much for the tuesday racquetball game.

16:27.940 --> 16:29.960
Did the clerk happen to see who he might have been meeting?

16:30.390 --> 16:33.520
No,but as he reminded me,in places like this,you're actually paid not to see.

16:33.990 --> 16:34.870
Shall we take a look?

16:37.510 --> 16:38.800
Seems pretty clear what happened.

16:39.110 --> 16:41.210
I guess when your time's up,your time's up.

16:42.740 --> 16:46.350
I think I ought to really drive over to dr. Bannister's,house,talk to his widow.

16:47.000 --> 16:50.940
Any way that you can give allison a ride  home so she can pick up her car?

16:51.220 --> 16:52.430
I don't want you to go out of your way.

16:52.490 --> 16:54.760
Just if you could give me a ride to city hall

16:54.810 --> 16:56.530
joe can pick me upon the way home.

16:57.410 --> 16:58.590
Yeah,sure,whatever works for you.

17:02.530 --> 17:03.740
Did you see any condoms?

17:04.920 --> 17:05.579
Excuse me?

17:05.940 --> 17:09.069
In the room back there-- did you see any condoms or condom wrappers?

17:09.609 --> 17:10.859
No,but what does that prove?

17:11.329 --> 17:14.530
Threw them out,flush them down the toilet,maid cleaned the room after his guest left.

17:14.700 --> 17:15.990
Where you going with this?

17:16.119 --> 17:17.550
The bed was made perfectly.

17:18.240 --> 17:19.270
They did it in the bathroom.

17:20.290 --> 17:22.829
No. The clothes were in a pile on the floor next to the bed.

17:23.000 --> 17:27.130
So he did a little horizontal rumba on the bed,went out for a bite to eat,the maid cleaned the room.

17:27.369 --> 17:28.600
Yeah,then he came back and took a shower?

17:28.690 --> 17:30.270
Since when did you become  an expert on these matter?

17:30.510 --> 17:32.500
I'm just saying,he had limited time.

17:32.630 --> 17:34.310
His wife thought he was playing racquetball.

17:34.550 --> 17:36.070
She expected him home at 9:00 or so.

17:36.500 --> 17:37.970
Just doesn't make any sense to me.

17:38.490 --> 17:39.880
What doesn't make sense to you?

17:40.010 --> 17:41.270
I don't think he was with a woman.

17:42.400 --> 17:45.130
What,he rented a seedy hotel room so he could take a shower?

17:45.300 --> 17:46.600
That's my point.

17:47.060 --> 17:48.290
We don't know why he was there.

17:48.320 --> 17:49.280
We're just guessing.

17:49.480 --> 17:52.350
Until we know why he was there,we can't be sure what happened to him.

17:52.380 --> 17:53.150
Sure we can.

17:53.360 --> 17:55.000
He slipped and fell in the shower,allison.

17:55.020 --> 17:56.050
Slips happen.

17:56.110 --> 17:56.960
It was his time.

17:57.390 --> 17:58.560
And when it's your time,it's your time

17:58.650 --> 17:59.600
Says who?

18:10.680 --> 18:12.640
I... I've been thinking about the bannister case.

18:13.110 --> 18:14.150
It's not a case,allison.

18:14.190 --> 18:15.000
These are cases.

18:15.200 --> 18:17.370
There's a crime,there's a motive,there's a suspect.

18:17.650 --> 18:18.640
But I have those.

18:19.360 --> 18:19.980
Really?

18:20.930 --> 18:21.550
So now you tell me

18:21.600 --> 18:26.790
you think some fiend slicked up that tub so dr. B would slip on purpose?

18:28.870 --> 18:30.230
Sykes V. Bannister.

18:30.620 --> 18:36.290
Turns out dr. Bannister is being sued by the father of a patient named jeremy sykes who died while under his care.

18:36.360 --> 18:37.650
He's a cancer doctor,allison.

18:37.820 --> 18:39.880
Lawsuits are practically part of the job description.

18:39.910 --> 18:44.610
Yes,but sykes went so far as to physically attack bannister during pretrial hearings.

18:45.150 --> 18:48.000
I take it he thought his son's death was somehow bannister's fault.

18:48.280 --> 18:50.650
Well,apparently,bannister was one of a handful of doctors

18:50.710 --> 18:54.650
treating patients with diathamoxin

18:56.930 --> 18:58.310
I know. I haven't heard of it either.

18:58.370 --> 18:58.960
It's new.

18:59.210 --> 19:00.500
It's from switzerland.

19:00.520 --> 19:03.790
Hasn't been approved by the fda,so insurance won't cover it.

19:05.260 --> 19:08.780
So sykes thought he was paying for a miracle cure,and when he didn't get it...

19:08.840 --> 19:11.930
not only didn't he get it,but according to the claim that sykes filed,

19:12.770 --> 19:16.480
jeremy got precipitously worse after taking this drugand died six months later.

19:17.610 --> 19:19.960
You have a crime,you have a suspect,you have a motive.

19:21.420 --> 19:22.340
I'll tell you what.

19:23.870 --> 19:25.400
The coroner's report should be issued tomorrow.

19:25.480 --> 19:27.000
Why don't you and i take a ride down there.

19:27.020 --> 19:29.520
If he gives me some reason to think that it wasn't an accident,

19:30.720 --> 19:32.290
I'll follow up on this hunch of yours.

19:36.380 --> 19:37.300
Something else?

19:39.940 --> 19:41.410
Can you give me a ride somewhere?

19:41.990 --> 19:43.310
It was so cool,daddy.

19:43.850 --> 19:47.970
I bet that the kids at school thought that we were getting arrested.

19:48.550 --> 19:49.950
One can only hope.

19:51.600 --> 19:53.660
Detective scanlon let me turn on the sirens.

19:54.050 --> 19:55.150
It was pretty exciting.

19:55.390 --> 19:56.670
Could we do it again tomorrow?

19:57.210 --> 19:58.640
Yeah,mom,can you drive me to work?

20:17.100 --> 20:20.780
abandon all hope,ye who enter here.

20:24.090 --> 20:26.930
Not exactly dante's inferno,but close enough.

20:31.380 --> 20:32.160
Six months.

20:40.620 --> 20:41.690
Six weeks.

20:49.180 --> 20:50.250
Two years tops.

20:50.940 --> 20:52.640
And there's no hope for any of them?

20:52.920 --> 20:53.760
There's an old saying.

20:54.310 --> 20:56.590
"The enemies of death are luck and hope."

20:57.270 --> 20:59.880
It's not true by the way.I'm good friends with both.

21:03.180 --> 21:05.440
I'm going to let you in on a secret,allison.

21:06.670 --> 21:08.620
It's not about the archetypal constructs of

21:08.750 --> 21:11.730
good and evil,faith and hope,life and the death

21:11.900 --> 21:15.290
It's about science,math,biology,

21:15.440 --> 21:17.870
the politics of finance,globle enconomics

21:18.290 --> 21:20.530
the cost of living versus the cost of dying,

21:20.960 --> 21:23.540
who can afford how much and who's willing to pay.

21:26.320 --> 21:28.310
Death is good.

21:29.440 --> 21:30.650
Death is necessary.

21:31.070 --> 21:32.580
And with a little bit of planning,

21:32.640 --> 21:35.980
death can even be a win-win.

21:36.560 --> 21:40.060
I honestly marvel at how passionately some people resist it.

21:40.130 --> 21:41.450
Take this case.

21:42.210 --> 21:43.140
Truly tragic.

21:48.860 --> 21:50.410
Is he going to die soon?

21:50.880 --> 21:51.670
No,damn it.

21:51.740 --> 21:53.140
He's going to go into remission.

21:53.420 --> 21:56.030
He's going to live a long and happy life,I'm afraid.

22:01.140 --> 22:05.520
Tell me,have you had a physical recently?

22:10.950 --> 22:12.460
Is there any way i could come in today?

22:13.810 --> 22:15.100
Who's mommy talking to?

22:15.190 --> 22:16.040
Doctor's office.

22:17.790 --> 22:19.890
If you don't have time for a full physical,

22:19.920 --> 22:23.780
is there any way i can come in for like a mini checkup just to tide me over?

22:24.990 --> 22:27.640
1:30 today. Okay,great

22:29.320 --> 22:30.160
Thanks bye

22:31.920 --> 22:32.650
Good morning.

22:33.050 --> 22:34.190
Mini checkup?

22:34.800 --> 22:36.650
I don't think they have those in our plan.

22:38.180 --> 22:40.760
Hey,can I talk to you over here for a moment?

22:48.620 --> 22:50.830
I'm having a little anxiety about my health.

22:50.930 --> 22:51.820
I don't see why.

22:52.460 --> 22:55.290
What with all the extra walking you'll be doing not that you won't drive.

22:56.090 --> 22:57.160
I'm asking for your help.

22:58.180 --> 23:01.900
What? 1:30?You want me to drive you?

23:02.510 --> 23:03.880
I'll be at work,allison.

23:04.130 --> 23:05.560
I don't need you to take me.

23:06.140 --> 23:09.070
Detective scanlon's coming to pick me up this morning to take me to the morgue.

23:09.280 --> 23:10.600
I'll probably get him to drop me off.

23:10.880 --> 23:14.040
I just need you to pick me up around 3:00 so we can go get the girls.

23:14.140 --> 23:15.500
Are you listening to yourself?

23:15.860 --> 23:18.030
One simple errand now involves

23:18.100 --> 23:20.880
a police escort and your husband taking off work early.

23:21.530 --> 23:22.890
Could I take that as a yes?

23:26.530 --> 23:30.270
Are you sure? I mean,he couldn't have been hit and moved into the shower to make it look like an accident?

23:30.710 --> 23:32.250
Not likely.

23:33.010 --> 23:36.690
You see here how this fits the indentation in the skull?

23:37.450 --> 23:41.090
So his injury is completely consistent with an accidental fall in the bathtub.

23:41.550 --> 23:43.280
You'd be surprised how common that is.

23:46.810 --> 23:48.310
You're not taking thomas road?

23:48.820 --> 23:50.390
It's faster.

23:50.600 --> 23:53.620
This is the intersection where I almost got hit by that truck.

23:58.870 --> 24:00.780
Oh,my god.That's him.

24:01.880 --> 24:02.800
That's death.

24:04.740 --> 24:05.690
Huh,what are you talking about?

24:06.670 --> 24:07.810
On that bus bench.

24:14.020 --> 24:17.520
Death's name is "bob"?

24:19.180 --> 24:20.200
But I don't understand.

24:20.220 --> 24:21.880
No one I know sends me an e-mail.

24:21.910 --> 24:24.100
No one I know has my e-mail address,

24:24.200 --> 24:26.630
but I still keep getting mail from people I've never met.

24:26.950 --> 24:28.080
It's called spam,sweetie.

24:28.100 --> 24:30.790
It's like junk mail,but it goes through your computer.

24:30.960 --> 24:33.820
But I don't like it.I want real mail.

24:34.350 --> 24:35.070
Tell you what.

24:35.120 --> 24:36.960
When I get into work,I'll send you something.

24:40.650 --> 24:41.720
Here.thank you

24:46.710 --> 24:48.180
You still looking at this guy?

24:49.170 --> 24:50.200
I'm going to call him.

24:51.070 --> 24:53.200
Why? We already have an insurance agent.

24:54.730 --> 24:57.650
Besides,I'm not sure how I feel about buying life from death.

24:58.110 --> 24:58.890
Not funny.

24:59.450 --> 25:00.400
I'm going to buy anything.

25:01.130 --> 25:02.380
I'm not going to sign anything.

25:03.300 --> 25:05.910
I'm just going to meet with him,get to the bottom of this thing.

25:06.000 --> 25:06.740
What thing?

25:09.370 --> 25:11.440
I'm just going to say this,allison.

25:12.680 --> 25:15.370
You used to drive through that intersection every day.

25:15.980 --> 25:16.530
So?

25:16.780 --> 25:18.210
So isn't it possible

25:18.270 --> 25:22.020
that you may have personified your anxieties about death?

25:22.710 --> 25:23.990
About mortality,

25:24.230 --> 25:25.550
about leaving the girls,

25:26.160 --> 25:26.940
leaving me

25:27.670 --> 25:29.070
and given them a face,

25:30.570 --> 25:31.340
his face?

25:35.710 --> 25:36.890
You know what?I take it back.

25:38.160 --> 25:39.460
Call this guy.Go see him.

25:39.530 --> 25:41.590
But do yourself a favor and drive there.

25:42.130 --> 25:43.490
Why are you saying this?

25:43.520 --> 25:45.290
Because if this guy is really death

25:46.170 --> 25:48.010
and your number really is up

25:49.400 --> 25:52.310
then it's up whether you drive or not.

25:52.560 --> 25:55.170
But if this guy is just an insurance agent,

25:55.750 --> 25:58.910
then you living your life in fear of something that might happen,

26:00.070 --> 26:01.320
that's no way toive.

26:10.330 --> 26:11.240
anything you need,

26:11.340 --> 26:12.370
anything at all.

26:12.730 --> 26:16.110
I hear there's aotor in flagstaff who might be willing to prescribe it.

26:16.210 --> 26:17.480
If you have any trouble getting in to see him,

26:17.580 --> 26:20.840
you tell them your viatical is with me and there's plenty of money left over for your treatment.

26:21.770 --> 26:23.010
Thank you,mr. Sherman.

26:23.050 --> 26:24.120
It's my pleasure. For everything

26:24.460 --> 26:25.000
Of course.

26:29.860 --> 26:31.250
I still can't believe he's gone.

26:31.380 --> 26:34.610
Yes,dr. Bannister was a lovely,lovely man.

26:39.300 --> 26:40.620
Oh,you must be mrs. Dubois.

26:40.970 --> 26:44.060
The only inevitable things in life are death,

26:44.300 --> 26:47.830
taxes and my assistant catching the flu at the worst possible time.

26:48.670 --> 26:49.660
I'm just about done here.

26:49.940 --> 26:52.110
Thank you for seeing me on such short notice.

26:52.380 --> 26:53.150
Oh,it's my pleasure.

26:54.240 --> 26:56.510
You're one of the few,mrs. Dubois,I can tell.

26:57.270 --> 26:57.970
The few?

26:58.980 --> 27:00.780
Most people think they're going to live forever,

27:00.840 --> 27:05.000
but there are a few of us who realize  that each moment could potentially be our last.

27:05.650 --> 27:07.700
We are the ones who prepare for the inevitable.

27:09.920 --> 27:12.230
It's none of my business,but the man who just left.

27:13.140 --> 27:13.840
Leukemia.

27:16.240 --> 27:18.180
Was he a patient of dr. Bannister's?

27:18.310 --> 27:19.230
Oh,did you know dean?

27:20.620 --> 27:21.940
No,not personally.

27:22.380 --> 27:24.320
I know people who are very fond of him.

27:26.290 --> 27:28.240
Pathetic way to lose one's life,isn't it,

27:29.540 --> 27:31.050
taking a spill in the shower?

27:32.360 --> 27:33.900
Pathetic but not uncommon,I'm afraid.

27:34.490 --> 27:37.870
Did you know that the average bathroom is one of the most perilous places on earth,

27:38.070 --> 27:39.760
statistically speaking of course?

27:40.180 --> 27:40.950
I heard that.

27:43.180 --> 27:44.940
How well did you know dr. Bannister?

27:45.920 --> 27:48.820
Oh,I wrote a policy for him  and his wife several years ago and we became friends.

27:50.090 --> 27:52.770
We used to play racquetball virtually every tuesday.

27:53.270 --> 27:54.770
Him. That's him.

27:55.460 --> 27:56.450
And the crime is?

27:56.650 --> 27:58.200
He said they played racquetball.

28:00.120 --> 28:02.100
Racquetball-playing and the claim to have played racquetball

28:02.120 --> 28:04.800
both have been decriminalized in arizona for quite some time.

28:05.150 --> 28:06.030
You're mocking me.

28:06.200 --> 28:07.690
I'm trying to reason with you.

28:07.720 --> 28:10.760
The victim in question appears to have slipped and fallen in a bathtub.

28:10.850 --> 28:12.610
That's heartbreaking,allison,

28:13.040 --> 28:14.030
but it's not illegal.

28:22.440 --> 28:25.160
someone! Anyone!

28:31.980 --> 28:33.820
You can't stop the inevitable,allison.

28:35.470 --> 28:37.160
So why not hurry it along instead?

28:44.810 --> 28:46.910
morning,early bird.What you doing,homework?

28:48.100 --> 28:49.420
No,I'm sending an e-mail.

28:49.850 --> 28:51.940
So one of your friends  finally sent you an e-mail,huh?

28:52.590 --> 28:55.680
No,I'm writing this company telling them to stop e-mailing me.

28:56.460 --> 28:58.170
They're writing,like,20 e-mails a day,

28:58.170 --> 29:00.110
and I have no idea what they're even talking about.

29:04.250 --> 29:08.990
There's usually something you can click on the bottom of the letter to get off their mailing list.

29:09.040 --> 29:09.620
I've done that.

29:09.940 --> 29:11.370
I've done that,like,ten times,

29:11.390 --> 29:13.170
and every time they'd write me a letter

29:13.220 --> 29:14.730
assuring me that this is not spam

29:14.790 --> 29:16.440
and that they're writing especially to me.

29:17.570 --> 29:18.690
Can I see some of these letters?

29:18.730 --> 29:19.870
Can you print some out?

29:20.330 --> 29:24.190
"Ariel,you could be making big money buying and selling viaticals."

29:25.130 --> 29:26.630
"Ariel,why aren't you profiting

29:27.580 --> 29:30.130
from the easy money to be made in viaticals?"

29:30.840 --> 29:33.790
"Ariel,want to get started in viaticals?We'll show you how."

29:34.800 --> 29:35.940
What's a viatical?

29:36.440 --> 29:37.360
A viatical.

29:38.420 --> 29:42.070
It's an instrument created to theoretically help  people realize

29:42.110 --> 29:44.870
the value of their life insurance before they die.

29:45.700 --> 29:47.430
You mean a way to borrow against it?

29:47.670 --> 29:48.660
Well,sort of.

29:49.670 --> 29:53.320
Say you have a life insurance policy that pays out a million dollars upon your death

29:53.390 --> 29:55.200
but you need the money now to,

29:55.570 --> 29:56.260
I don't know,

29:56.510 --> 29:58.750
pay for an experimental drug treatment to keep you alive.

29:59.260 --> 30:01.370
You can sell your policy to someone like sherman,

30:01.520 --> 30:03.620
who agrees to give you a couple hundred grand up front,

30:03.690 --> 30:04.720
pay your premiums,

30:04.750 --> 30:07.720
plus give you a monthly stipend s long as you're alive.

30:07.990 --> 30:09.240
Well,what's in it for sherman?

30:09.520 --> 30:11.150
Well,he's betting that you die

30:11.200 --> 30:13.040
before he has to pay out the whole million.

30:13.430 --> 30:16.410
And if you do,he gets to pocket the balance.

30:17.060 --> 30:18.300
What a cynical way to make a living.

30:19.320 --> 30:20.790
No wonder I dreamt he was death.

30:22.140 --> 30:23.310
Still doesn't make him a murderer.

30:23.590 --> 30:25.360
I know,but there is some connection,

30:25.480 --> 30:26.550
and it's not just racquetball.

30:26.880 --> 30:29.620
I saw him standing in that motel room,

30:29.690 --> 30:32.900
a wall of fire behind him,welcoming bannister.

30:33.450 --> 30:35.120
Well,they were colleaguesof a sort.

30:35.360 --> 30:38.050
One man administered the experimental drug treatment,

30:38.110 --> 30:39.430
and the other helped you pay for it.

30:42.410 --> 30:43.840
What if the drugs were bad?

30:45.480 --> 30:46.180
I don't follow.

30:47.530 --> 30:50.790
I had this dream last night i was in this hospital ward,

30:51.660 --> 30:54.630
and this woman,she was struggling against the drugs she had been given.

30:54.910 --> 30:56.010
Turns out,they weren't drugs at all.

30:56.070 --> 30:58.290
It was just... sand.

30:59.660 --> 31:00.780
I still don't follow.

31:00.980 --> 31:03.810
If your drugs are bad,you die quicker,right?

31:04.470 --> 31:08.430
Which is good for whoever buys your viatical,isn't it?

31:10.330 --> 31:11.500
It's an interesting theory.

31:13.720 --> 31:15.670
Maybe I'll have scanlon do a little research.

31:16.550 --> 31:17.400
Research? That's it?

31:17.970 --> 31:19.700
Well,let's see how the research goes,

31:19.720 --> 31:22.770
and if we like what we see,maybe we'll play a little poker.

31:24.220 --> 31:26.130
Poker?With who?

31:36.620 --> 31:38.430
Mr. Sherman,I appreciate you coming down here.

31:39.040 --> 31:43.390
In the course of investigating the death of your friend,your client dr. Bannister,

31:43.500 --> 31:46.000
some questions have arisen about the nature of his medical practice.

31:47.070 --> 31:50.480
My questions really have to do with certain civil suits that were pending

31:50.770 --> 31:52.910
against dr. Bannister prior to his passing.

31:54.850 --> 31:55.700
I see.

31:56.730 --> 32:00.110
I was hardly privy to everything about his practice,

32:00.650 --> 32:02.200
but I'll be glad to tell you what I know.

32:05.710 --> 32:07.440
Do you recognize any of the names on the list?

32:08.750 --> 32:10.400
I take it this is a list of dean's patients?

32:12.640 --> 32:13.560
Yes,I do.

32:14.250 --> 32:15.790
I did business with several of them.

32:16.180 --> 32:20.040
By business,you mean you purchased their life insurance policies,isn't that right?

32:20.910 --> 32:24.070
Providing viaticals for them to pay for their treatments?

32:24.900 --> 32:26.190
With several of them,yes.

32:26.470 --> 32:29.230
Nine,actually,out of the 23 patients on the list.

32:29.560 --> 32:32.800
Out of the 23 patients involved in bannister's experimental drug treatments,

32:32.810 --> 32:35.010
you purchased the life insurance policies of nine.

32:35.400 --> 32:36.210
Isn't that correct?

32:36.600 --> 32:37.370
It's possible.

32:38.600 --> 32:40.070
I don't have my records with me.

32:40.200 --> 32:42.480
Be glad to confirm that figure when I return to my office.

32:43.600 --> 32:44.930
Am I missing something here?

32:45.580 --> 32:48.510
I'm curious. Did dr. Bannister refer these patients to you?

32:48.610 --> 32:51.030
Yes,he did.I was only too happy to help.

32:51.210 --> 32:51.980
Help?

32:53.030 --> 32:53.840
I'm confused.

32:54.710 --> 32:56.000
The way that I understood it,

32:56.940 --> 32:59.210
the quicker these patients die,the more you stand to profit.

33:02.620 --> 33:03.540
Everyone dies.

33:04.180 --> 33:06.650
And every business existsto make a profit.

33:07.780 --> 33:11.360
Now,it's true,mine may appear to be an especially morbid business,

33:11.450 --> 33:14.050
but... the fact is,

33:14.680 --> 33:20.950
a viatical can be a godsend to a poor soul who's fighting for his life and has no other resources.

33:22.750 --> 33:26.060
Still,what you do isn't exactly charity,mr. Sherman.

33:26.450 --> 33:28.650
You don't really understand the business of dying,do you?

33:30.590 --> 33:32.130
I'm a homicide detective,sir.

33:32.150 --> 33:33.660
Oh,yes. You know about death.

33:33.940 --> 33:35.550
The messy aftermath,the suffering.

33:36.600 --> 33:39.180
But I'm talking about the suffering itself,detective.

33:39.350 --> 33:40.530
I'm talking about dying.

33:41.620 --> 33:46.770
A dying man will do anything in his power to cling to the last shreds of life,

33:46.860 --> 33:49.020
no matter how painful his existence has become.

33:50.220 --> 33:51.180
He'll do anything,

33:51.350 --> 33:52.640
give anything

33:53.320 --> 33:58.170
sell any thing all for a little hope

33:58.520 --> 33:59.700
And you gave that hope.

33:59.830 --> 34:01.190
Yes,I did.

34:02.680 --> 34:04.420
And dr. Bannister gave them even more than that.

34:04.550 --> 34:05.470
He gave them results.

34:05.550 --> 34:07.760
The man was considered something of a miracle worker.

34:07.810 --> 34:09.179
You see,that's the strange part.

34:09.310 --> 34:12.060
That's the part that we can't quite figure out because,for a miracle worker,

34:12.150 --> 34:13.949
dr. Bannister was having a pretty off year.

34:14.340 --> 34:15.110
How do you mean?

34:15.900 --> 34:19.320
Of the 23 patients involved in bannister's experimental drug program,

34:19.420 --> 34:21.400
12 of them died in the past nine months.

34:21.570 --> 34:25.130
And of that 12,seven of them had sold their life insurance policies to you.

34:26.150 --> 34:27.060
Seven,you say?

34:28.690 --> 34:29.679
I had no idea it was that many.

34:29.790 --> 34:31.210
You want to hear another strange statistic?

34:32.260 --> 34:34.460
According to the records of bannister's swiss drug supplier,

34:34.560 --> 34:38.530
bannister purchased enough medication to treat ten patients last year.

34:39.840 --> 34:41.420
Remarkably,he managed to treat 23.

34:42.510 --> 34:46.260
We believe that dr. Bannister may have been diluting his drugs.

34:46.870 --> 34:47.679
That's absurd.

34:48.190 --> 34:51.159
Dr. Bannister was a brilliant,compassionate man.

34:52.469 --> 34:54.239
He loved his patients above all things.

34:54.370 --> 34:56.560
Well,maybe not above all things.

34:57.430 --> 34:59.880
And as you pointed out,everyone dies eventually.

35:00.620 --> 35:01.280
Anyway.

35:02.660 --> 35:07.960
The sad truth is,it appears the good doctor's patients paid full price for their treatment

35:08.090 --> 35:11.470
and were getting medications that were only a third of the necessary potency.

35:11.640 --> 35:13.690
With bannister pocketing the difference.

35:13.860 --> 35:14.410
I'm sorry.

35:15.500 --> 35:17.600
None of this sounds like the man I know.

35:17.630 --> 35:22.450
I mean,really,how much money could possibly be made by diluting a handful of patients' drugs?

35:22.510 --> 35:23.320
It sounds preposterous.

35:23.340 --> 35:24.030
I agree.

35:24.500 --> 35:28.690
Which brings me back to the seven patients  whose life insurance policies you bought

35:28.970 --> 35:32.010
and who began dying shortly after you started paying for their treatment.

35:32.630 --> 35:35.230
Were they just terribly unlucky,

35:35.250 --> 35:38.890
or were you incredibly good at picking winners?

35:41.260 --> 35:43.310
The two of you were quite a team,weren't you?

35:43.770 --> 35:48.550
He would make sure the patients whose viaticals you owned started dying a little quicker,

35:48.640 --> 35:50.220
and in return,he got a cut of the payment.

35:53.170 --> 35:54.580
Am I being charged with something?

35:54.600 --> 35:56.330
Is that what's going on here?

36:03.630 --> 36:05.440
I'm guessing from your collective silence

36:05.500 --> 36:08.300
that you don't have the evidence to support these absurd allegations.

36:10.300 --> 36:11.140
Of course not.

36:12.550 --> 36:13.320
They're not true.

36:19.560 --> 36:21.320
what active imaginations you all have.

36:24.250 --> 36:25.420
How dare you?

36:26.030 --> 36:28.530
For god's sake,the man slipped and fell in his shower.

36:31.600 --> 36:32.630
You'll be hearing from my attorney.

36:32.810 --> 36:33.660
Have no fear.

36:34.740 --> 36:36.330
Your attorney will be hearing from me.

37:27.830 --> 37:29.010
I know how he did it.

37:29.220 --> 37:31.570
Dr. Bannister didn't slip and fall by accident.

37:31.630 --> 37:33.130
Sherman planned the whole thing.

37:33.510 --> 37:34.520
Allison.I saw it

37:34.720 --> 37:37.070
He unscrewed the spigot from the bathtub wall.

37:37.170 --> 37:41.830
He smashed bannister in the skull,then he dragged his body  back over to the tub to make it look like a fall.

37:42.790 --> 37:43.490
Allison... you should have seen him

37:43.550 --> 37:44.840
That cold bastard.

37:45.300 --> 37:50.190
Arranging bannister's body so it would match the hundreds of slip-and-sue cases he's settled on over the years.

37:50.240 --> 37:53.360
Putting plastic on the floor so their would be no blood for us to...allison!

37:55.870 --> 37:56.640
I believe you.

37:58.610 --> 37:59.420
I believe you.

37:59.420 --> 38:01.330
I'm just not sure there is anything i can do about it.

38:02.420 --> 38:05.180
The fact is,forensics has already been over that spigot.

38:05.280 --> 38:08.730
The bathtub,bannister's body,they're all clean.

38:09.940 --> 38:10.960
I don't understand,then.

38:11.030 --> 38:12.130
Why would you believe me?

38:12.380 --> 38:13.550
Wh-what's changed your mind?

38:14.060 --> 38:17.240
Well  after our meeting yesterday,I had a thought.

38:17.970 --> 38:20.270
I told detective scanlon to go back to that motel

38:20.480 --> 38:22.090
and ask the desk clerk one more time

38:22.230 --> 38:25.240
if he remembered seeing anyone that might have been meeting bannister,

38:25.330 --> 38:29.190
and,to make it clear that we weren't necessarily talking about a female.

38:29.320 --> 38:33.010
I also asked him to bring along the ad from the phone book you had given me,

38:33.100 --> 38:34.680
the one with sherman's picture in it.

38:34.810 --> 38:35.840
That he recognized.

38:36.340 --> 38:38.370
Turns out he was very familiar with sherman.

38:38.800 --> 38:40.230
Well,what are we going to do now?

38:40.330 --> 38:41.330
That's what I'm trying to tell you.

38:41.390 --> 38:42.190
I already did it.

38:42.220 --> 38:44.840
I told scanlon to bring sherman back in for questioning.

38:45.350 --> 38:47.220
He went over to his office first thing this morning.

38:47.640 --> 38:49.190
Oh,my god,that's great.

38:49.240 --> 38:49.900
It's closed.

38:51.510 --> 38:52.240
Excuse me?

38:52.590 --> 38:53.400
His office.

38:54.160 --> 38:55.010
It's closed.

38:55.470 --> 38:57.930
Looks like he got out all the important things last night.

38:57.990 --> 39:00.030
Scanlon went over to his house-- same thing there.

39:00.270 --> 39:02.950
Bank accounts emptied,no forwarding numbers on his phones.

39:03.630 --> 39:04.730
Well,where would he have gone?

39:05.120 --> 39:06.460
Out of the country,I guess.

39:06.600 --> 39:07.620
Cayman islands,maybe.

39:07.680 --> 39:08.890
They like american money.Who knows.

39:10.960 --> 39:11.690
He did it.

39:14.480 --> 39:15.360
I think he did.

39:16.490 --> 39:20.760
And I think,for the moment,he wins.

39:21.780 --> 39:23.760
It's just...wrong,joe

39:23.930 --> 39:27.050
It's wrong that this guy should cause so much pain and misery

39:27.120 --> 39:28.700
to  others and just get away with it

39:29.300 --> 39:30.520
I agree with you.

39:31.020 --> 39:34.110
It's a terrible thing,and he's a terrible guy.

39:34.790 --> 39:36.420
But there's nothing for you to do now.

39:36.590 --> 39:38.460
You've done all that you can do.

39:39.600 --> 39:42.010
Now you just have to,I don't know,

39:42.100 --> 39:43.720
let it go and trust that...

39:44.150 --> 39:45.210
trust that what?

39:46.000 --> 39:48.210
Trust that what goes around comes around,

39:48.440 --> 39:51.910
that he'll get his,that there's some kind of justice out there in the universe.

39:52.040 --> 39:53.140
You don't believe that.

39:53.270 --> 39:54.780
I don't know what I believe.

39:55.460 --> 39:56.820
It's almost midnight,

39:56.880 --> 39:58.670
and we've been talking about this for hours.

39:59.060 --> 40:01.850
I believe we need to get some sleep.

40:02.530 --> 40:04.590
I believe that everything will work out.

40:05.090 --> 40:06.040
It always does.

40:07.170 --> 40:08.750
I'm glad that you're so certain.

40:10.280 --> 40:12.260
'Cause I'm not sure i believe that anymore.

40:13.240 --> 40:15.230
I'm not sure that things do come around.

40:18.080 --> 40:19.660
I'm not sure about anything.

40:32.490 --> 40:33.550
if that's the mai tai I ordered,

40:33.610 --> 40:37.200
could you just please bring it in here and place it on the counter,my good fellow?

40:52.340 --> 40:53.630
nice to see you,mr. Sherman.

40:55.160 --> 40:56.520
Ready to do a little business?

40:57.540 --> 41:01.250
Did you know that 47% of all accidental deaths take place in the home?

41:01.450 --> 41:04.550
And 61% of those happen in the bathroom.

41:07.110 --> 41:08.570
Caymans are really lovely this time of year.

41:09.290 --> 41:11.830
You really should be quite pleased with yourself.

41:12.220 --> 41:14.500
You've chosen a spectacular place to die.

41:19.110 --> 41:20.140
Watch that soap.

41:41.260 --> 41:42.040
Are you all right?

41:42.980 --> 41:43.860
Everything okay?

41:44.620 --> 41:45.460
What's going on?

41:46.560 --> 41:47.470
Oh,nothing.

41:49.890 --> 41:54.040
I just got woken up by the sound of everything coming around.

41:57.870 --> 41:58.710
nothing.

42:00.020 --> 42:02.220
Never mind.Everything's fine

42:06.020 --> 42:07.490
go back to sleep.

00:00.500 --> 00:02.000
