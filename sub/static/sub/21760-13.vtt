Good morning,
Mayor Pig.

01:20.620 --> 01:23.540
It's so nice
to see your
smiling face

01:23.540 --> 01:26.250
on this bright,
shiny penny of a day.

01:26.250 --> 01:28.540
No whistling!

01:28.540 --> 01:31.420
-No whistling!

01:31.420 --> 01:33.040
I can't whistle,

01:33.040 --> 01:35.330
never have been
able to.

01:35.330 --> 01:37.670
So that means
you can't whistle neither.

01:37.670 --> 01:41.080
But whistling is a way
of audibly extending

01:41.080 --> 01:42.920
your inner joy
to those around--

01:42.920 --> 01:44.500
I'm the mayor,

01:44.500 --> 01:45.920
and I have passed a law

01:45.920 --> 01:48.040
stating that
no whistling
is allowed

01:48.040 --> 01:49.540
on this here farm!

01:50.960 --> 01:54.500
Thank you for sharing,
Your Lard-ship.

01:55.540 --> 01:59.000
This feels great.

01:59.000 --> 02:01.880
Yeah,
you said it, Patch.

02:01.880 --> 02:04.710
There's nothing quite
like lounging out here

02:04.710 --> 02:06.960
in the sun, baking.

02:06.960 --> 02:08.960
Did somebody say "bacon"?

02:08.960 --> 02:11.080
Uh, I did.
Why?

02:11.080 --> 02:13.920
A blatant disrespect
for the law.

02:13.920 --> 02:15.330
What law?

02:15.330 --> 02:19.960
Farm municipal code 34.5.16

02:19.960 --> 02:22.120
blah, blah, blah,
etcetera, fill in the blank,

02:22.120 --> 02:23.880
which clearly states

02:23.880 --> 02:28.040
"No farm resident shall
utter the word 'bacon.'"

02:32.080 --> 02:34.000
Uh-huh, well.

02:34.000 --> 02:37.040
I guess porky's out too,
huh?

02:41.500 --> 02:43.000
Whoa, ah!

02:44.040 --> 02:45.830
Female Announcer:
Coming up next--

02:45.830 --> 02:48.960
ten top reasons why
the chicken crossed the road

02:48.960 --> 02:50.830
on the Poultry Channel.

02:50.830 --> 02:53.830
All poultry
all the time.

02:53.830 --> 02:55.830
Male Announcer:
Swine TV will return

02:55.830 --> 02:58.830
with an all-new episode of
"Three Pigs in a Blanket."

02:58.830 --> 03:01.080
Hey, who changed
the channel?

03:01.080 --> 03:04.880
I did.
It's time for
"Three Pigs in a Blanket."

03:04.880 --> 03:06.830
B-but that's not nice

03:06.830 --> 03:08.120
to just change
the channel

03:08.120 --> 03:10.080
when somebody else
is watching.

03:10.080 --> 03:13.210
It's not a matter
of nice or not.

03:13.210 --> 03:15.540
It's a matter
of the law.

03:15.540 --> 03:18.460
-The law,
according to me,

03:18.460 --> 03:22.460
clearly states that
between 10:00 and 10:30 AM,

03:22.460 --> 03:24.920
all TVs will be tuned

03:24.920 --> 03:27.040
to "Three Pigs
in a Blanket."

03:27.040 --> 03:29.540
-B-b-but--
-This time
I'm lettin' you off

03:29.540 --> 03:31.000
with a warning, chicken.

03:32.080 --> 03:34.620
Next time,
I'm having you towed.

03:42.420 --> 03:44.920
Man, is it hot?

03:44.920 --> 03:47.250
What I wouldn't do
for a big old bucket

03:47.250 --> 03:48.790
-of ice cream.

03:52.000 --> 03:54.000
Whoa, whoa.

03:54.000 --> 03:57.460
Well, what do you know,
a big old bucket of ice cream.

03:57.460 --> 03:58.500
Cool.

03:58.500 --> 04:01.830
-I'm hot.
-I'm hungry.

04:01.830 --> 04:05.830
Let's all think
ice cream.

04:05.830 --> 04:08.830
-Lucky: Whoa, oh!

04:08.830 --> 04:11.920
Ice cream!

04:11.920 --> 04:13.880
Cadpig: Everybody,
stop thinking!

04:17.920 --> 04:22.000
-It's beautiful.
-It's awesome.

04:22.000 --> 04:25.580
It's double caramel,
triple mint,

04:25.580 --> 04:27.960
marshmallow chip!

04:27.960 --> 04:29.620
It's ours.

04:29.620 --> 04:32.580
Ed:
Hold it right there,
boys and girls.

04:32.580 --> 04:36.040
As mayor,
I am required
to certify

04:36.040 --> 04:38.750
that the contents
of this container

04:38.750 --> 04:40.290
are, uh...

04:40.290 --> 04:41.750
certified.

04:41.750 --> 04:43.460
I'm sure it's fine,

04:43.460 --> 04:45.120
and it's full of
double caramel,

04:45.120 --> 04:46.920
triple mint,
marshmallow...

04:49.880 --> 04:51.750
chip.

04:51.750 --> 04:53.210
Yeah.

04:53.210 --> 04:55.040
Checks out.

04:55.040 --> 04:58.880
What a P-I-G, pig!

04:58.880 --> 05:02.290
That's Mayor P-I-G, pig.

05:03.790 --> 05:07.290
Hey, wait a second,
Mayor Pig.

05:07.290 --> 05:09.210
That ice cream was ours.

05:09.210 --> 05:10.790
We're the ones
that found it.

05:10.790 --> 05:12.830
Law says all items

05:12.830 --> 05:14.920
found on
common farm property

05:14.920 --> 05:17.620
must be inspected
by the authorities,

05:17.620 --> 05:19.120
who are me.

05:19.120 --> 05:21.500
But that's not fair.

05:21.500 --> 05:23.880
And neither is not
being able to whistle.

05:23.880 --> 05:26.380
Or say the word bacon.

05:26.380 --> 05:28.540
Or watch my TV show.

05:28.540 --> 05:30.170
Well...

05:30.170 --> 05:32.920
I'm the mayor,
and the mayor
makes the laws.

05:32.920 --> 05:36.790
And it is now
hereby illegal
to complain.

05:38.830 --> 05:41.460
Who elected
him mayor, anyhow?

05:41.460 --> 05:44.750
All the farm animals
elected him, that's who.

05:44.750 --> 05:46.920
But he's taking
advantage of it.

05:46.920 --> 05:48.500
He should
be making laws

05:48.500 --> 05:50.380
that'll make life
better for everybody,

05:50.380 --> 05:52.000
not just himself.

05:52.000 --> 05:54.000
Well, yes, of course,

05:54.000 --> 05:56.120
but, well,
he does a good job

05:56.120 --> 05:57.830
of keeping things
calm around here.

05:57.830 --> 06:01.170
Well, being a mayor's
no easy task.

06:01.170 --> 06:04.330
Hmph, sounds
pretty easy to me.

06:04.330 --> 06:06.380
Anybody could do
what Ed's doing.

06:06.380 --> 06:09.210
-Rolly or Cadpig or Spot--

06:12.040 --> 06:14.920
Well, maybe not Spot.

06:14.920 --> 06:16.670
What about you?

06:16.670 --> 06:18.670
-Yeah.

06:18.670 --> 06:21.040
Why can't
you run for mayor?

06:21.040 --> 06:23.750
You're charismatic.
You talk a lot.

06:23.750 --> 06:26.960
You're pushy.
You're always telling
people what to do.

06:26.960 --> 06:29.580
Okay, okay.
I get your point.

06:29.580 --> 06:32.500
I can even be
your personal
image consultant.

06:32.500 --> 06:34.960
I love manipulating the truth.

06:34.960 --> 06:37.170
And I could
be your advisor.

06:37.170 --> 06:40.290
And I can manage
your campaign.

06:40.290 --> 06:42.790
I have a knack
for seeing trouble coming.

06:46.380 --> 06:48.580
Hmm, Mayor Lucky.

06:48.580 --> 06:50.500
I kind of like
the sound of that.

06:50.500 --> 06:51.710
What do you think,
Colonel?

06:51.710 --> 06:53.790
Well...

06:53.790 --> 06:55.620
It might do
old Ed some good

06:55.620 --> 06:58.000
to have a little
healthy competition
for a change.

06:58.000 --> 07:01.620
Of course,
you'll have to ask him
about the rules.

07:01.620 --> 07:04.290
After all,
he's the one
that makes them.

07:05.670 --> 07:07.710
No problem at all,
Lucky.

07:07.710 --> 07:11.040
You're more than welcome
to run against me for mayor.

07:11.040 --> 07:13.080
Great.
That was easy.

07:13.080 --> 07:15.540
All you have to do
is collect--

07:15.540 --> 07:18.120
oh, let me see...

07:18.120 --> 07:20.620
101 signatures.

07:20.620 --> 07:23.330
-No problem.
-We can do that.

07:23.330 --> 07:26.790
By, uh, uh--
what time is it?

07:26.790 --> 07:29.500
Uh...

07:29.500 --> 07:31.790
I think it's 11:45.

07:31.790 --> 07:34.000
By noon.

07:34.000 --> 07:36.580
-And sign right here.

07:36.580 --> 07:38.080
Thank you very much.

07:38.080 --> 07:39.670
-Thank you.
-All right, Captain,

07:39.670 --> 07:42.290
-mark it right here.
-Got your signature.

07:42.290 --> 07:45.620
-All righty then.
-Hey, come back here!

07:51.830 --> 07:54.670
-There you go.

07:54.670 --> 07:55.830
That's right.

07:55.830 --> 07:57.790
Looks like
the race is on!

07:57.790 --> 07:59.960
Ah, now, now,
not so fast.

07:59.960 --> 08:01.960
Getting all
them signatures

08:01.960 --> 08:03.750
was just the first step.

08:03.750 --> 08:05.580
You mean there's more?

08:05.580 --> 08:07.120
That's right.

08:07.120 --> 08:09.710
The farm bylaws
clearly state

08:09.710 --> 08:13.000
a candidate for office
must have a platform.

08:13.000 --> 08:14.710
That's mine
over yonder.

08:16.790 --> 08:18.830
So if you
run against me,

08:18.830 --> 08:20.120
you're gonna
have to, uh--

08:20.120 --> 08:22.210
to build you one
for you.

08:32.580 --> 08:33.880
Whoa!

08:35.250 --> 08:37.330
Okay.

08:37.330 --> 08:39.290
Here's my platform.

08:39.290 --> 08:41.540
I'm ready
to be the mayor.

08:41.540 --> 08:44.040
Now, now, Lucky.

08:44.040 --> 08:45.960
You don't
just become mayor.

08:45.960 --> 08:47.880
You got to run for office,

08:47.880 --> 08:49.830
and there's more
to running for office

08:49.830 --> 08:53.170
than collecting signatures
and building a platform.

08:53.170 --> 08:54.620
What's next?

08:54.620 --> 08:56.120
Why...

08:56.120 --> 08:58.210
-mudslinging of course.

08:58.210 --> 08:59.920
-Ahh.
-Yuck.

09:02.790 --> 09:03.960
Now I want you to--

09:03.960 --> 09:05.460
I mean...

09:05.460 --> 09:09.500
the law says
you must climb
to the top, of, uh...

09:09.500 --> 09:12.670
the Matterhorn
and yodel your nomination.

09:12.670 --> 09:14.620
Wait a minute.
Hold it.

09:14.620 --> 09:16.170
Are you just gonna keep

09:16.170 --> 09:18.540
giving us stuff to do
until we give up?

09:18.540 --> 09:20.080
You have a problem
with that?

09:20.080 --> 09:23.920
What Lucky means is
he believes you have

09:23.920 --> 09:27.420
a deep-seated subconscious
fear of losing.

09:27.420 --> 09:30.170
In other words,
he's calling you

09:30.170 --> 09:32.420
a yellow-bellied,
lily-livered chicken!

09:32.420 --> 09:34.380
Not that
that's a bad thing.

09:34.380 --> 09:38.210
Okay, you spotted
little yahoos.

09:38.210 --> 09:40.670
If Lucky wants
to run for mayor,

09:40.670 --> 09:42.380
you're on,

09:42.380 --> 09:43.920
but you're gonna be sorry

09:43.920 --> 09:47.580
you ever went up
against Ed Pig.

09:51.620 --> 09:53.790
Lucky:
And if I'm elected mayor,

09:53.790 --> 09:56.830
I'll get rid of all
of Mayor Pig's unfair laws

09:56.830 --> 10:00.040
so this farm will have
a mayor just like you,

10:00.040 --> 10:02.580
a regular egg-laying puppy.

10:02.580 --> 10:03.620
-Whoa!

10:05.040 --> 10:07.420
You're cracked
if you don't vote for Lucky.

10:12.420 --> 10:14.500
Lucky:
Hey, Captain,
mind if I join you?

10:32.580 --> 10:34.960
Hey, you guys
want to play?

10:42.170 --> 10:43.500
No problem.

10:51.170 --> 10:53.750
Uh, I'll only go so far.

10:57.670 --> 10:59.750
Well, that's everybody, Lucky.

10:59.750 --> 11:01.710
You've really
shown the animals

11:01.710 --> 11:05.000
what a truthful and helpful
candidate you are.

11:05.000 --> 11:07.380
Ooh, I'll bet we're
moving ahead of Mayor Pig

11:07.380 --> 11:08.670
right now!

11:08.670 --> 11:11.330
Rolly, what happened
when you took that poll?

11:11.330 --> 11:13.670
What happened
when I took the pole?

11:13.670 --> 11:15.250
The fence fell down.

11:17.960 --> 11:19.960
Fence...
It fell down.

11:19.960 --> 11:21.460
Do you get it?
Aww, man.

11:21.460 --> 11:23.460
Look, I'm a pole.

11:27.790 --> 11:29.710
Knock it off, Rolly.

11:29.710 --> 11:31.330
The popularity poll.

11:31.330 --> 11:35.000
Aww, you're way ahead
of Mayor Pig.

11:35.000 --> 11:37.500
Must be
the clever slogan
I devised.

11:37.500 --> 11:39.250
Vote for Lucky.

11:39.250 --> 11:41.500
Oh, no, no, no, no.

11:41.500 --> 11:45.790
It's because the planet's
current alignment favors dogs.

11:45.790 --> 11:47.250
We're in a Pluto phase.

11:47.250 --> 11:49.460
It's none of those things, guys.

11:49.460 --> 11:51.420
It's honesty and hard work.

11:51.420 --> 11:52.790
That's why
we're ahead.

11:52.790 --> 11:55.290
Nothing can
stop us now.

11:55.290 --> 11:57.580
We're gonna mow
right over that old pig.

12:01.120 --> 12:03.710
Look at all
the pretty spots.

12:12.960 --> 12:15.500
Mayor Pig's giving away
free bones.

12:15.500 --> 12:17.460
-Let's go!
-Rolly.

12:17.460 --> 12:20.330
Oh, I mean...

12:20.330 --> 12:22.960
Uh, what a tragic example

12:22.960 --> 12:24.830
if political corruption
in our times--

12:24.830 --> 12:27.040
trading bones
for votes.

12:27.040 --> 12:30.830
Personally,
I advise you not
to take one, Lucky.

12:30.830 --> 12:33.620
Of course I'm not
gonna take one.

12:33.620 --> 12:35.880
Tripod, are you really

12:35.880 --> 12:37.420
gonna vote
for Mayor Pig

12:37.420 --> 12:39.620
because he gave you
a free bone?

12:39.620 --> 12:41.210
Why not?

12:41.210 --> 12:43.170
I think it's pretty cool
he's giving stuff away.

12:46.830 --> 12:51.170
What's next?
Delux chicken feed
for the henhouse?

13:11.620 --> 13:13.620
Numbers are looking
b-bad, Lucky.

13:13.620 --> 13:15.580
Mayor Pig's
free food gambit

13:15.580 --> 13:17.380
is working
like a charm.

13:17.380 --> 13:18.420
How bad is it?

13:18.420 --> 13:20.250
According to the poll,

13:20.250 --> 13:21.920
animals are coming over
from other farms

13:21.920 --> 13:23.710
-to vote against you.

13:23.710 --> 13:25.040
Shameful.

13:25.040 --> 13:26.670
Looks like
all your big ideas

13:26.670 --> 13:29.080
we're traded for
all you can eat.

13:29.080 --> 13:30.710
Lucky:
Hey, where'd
you get that?

13:32.040 --> 13:34.210
-Found it.
-Hmm.

13:34.210 --> 13:36.580
Maybe if we gave you
a few more spots.

13:36.580 --> 13:39.620
Ooh! A more
patriotic collar perhaps.

13:39.620 --> 13:41.830
No, that's not gonna work.

13:41.830 --> 13:44.620
I thought I could win over
the animals with the truth,

13:44.620 --> 13:48.000
and show them somebody
who's fair and on their side,

13:48.000 --> 13:51.210
but Ed gave them
what they really wanted.

13:51.210 --> 13:52.710
So what are you gonna do?

13:52.710 --> 13:54.830
Yeah,
election's tomorrow.

13:54.830 --> 13:56.250
You better
think of something.

14:02.580 --> 14:04.880
And if I'm elected Mayor,

14:04.880 --> 14:08.290
I'll get rid of all
of Mayor Pig's unfair laws.

14:08.290 --> 14:10.380
Hey, we've heard this speech.

14:10.380 --> 14:13.170
If you don't have anything
interesting to say, move along!

14:13.170 --> 14:15.170
It's crowded enough
in here as it is.

14:15.170 --> 14:18.210
Well, maybe you could
use a bigger hen house then.

14:18.210 --> 14:19.250
What's that?

14:19.250 --> 14:22.120
I said you need
a bigger hen house.

14:22.120 --> 14:24.790
Do you hear that girls?
If we vote for Lucky,

14:24.790 --> 14:27.000
he promises to get us
a bigger hen house.

14:27.000 --> 14:29.460
Well, that's not
exactly what I meant.

14:29.460 --> 14:32.380
Vote for Lucky
and get a new hen house!

14:32.380 --> 14:34.250
-Hooray!

14:35.170 --> 14:36.580
Rolly:
You shouldn't
have said

14:36.580 --> 14:38.170
you'd build them
a new hen house.

14:38.170 --> 14:40.170
But I got their votes,
didn't I?

14:40.170 --> 14:42.580
Don't worry
about the details, Rolly.

14:42.580 --> 14:45.250
The important thing
is to beat Mayor Pig.

14:45.250 --> 14:47.710
-But you promised them.

14:47.710 --> 14:50.420
Hey, I don't want any
wishy-washiness

14:50.420 --> 14:53.170
from the soon-to-be
vice mayor.

14:54.250 --> 14:55.880
Wow, me?

14:55.880 --> 14:57.170
Vice mayor?

14:57.170 --> 14:59.620
Can I be your
vice, vice mayor?

14:59.620 --> 15:01.670
Sure, and while
we're at it,

15:01.670 --> 15:03.290
why don't we make
the chicken

15:03.290 --> 15:04.920
the vice, vice,
vice mayor.

15:04.920 --> 15:06.290
Thanks, Lucky.

15:06.290 --> 15:08.080
No problem.

15:08.080 --> 15:09.920
As long as
you vote for Lucky,

15:09.920 --> 15:11.540
that's my promise to you.

15:11.540 --> 15:15.080
Gold-plated horse shoes
when you vote for Lucky,

15:15.080 --> 15:17.120
that's my promise to you.

15:17.120 --> 15:20.420
Heated milking gloves
on every human,

15:20.420 --> 15:22.290
that's my promise to you.

15:24.210 --> 15:25.960
A new color TV

15:25.960 --> 15:27.670
for each and every
one of us,

15:27.670 --> 15:30.250
that's my promise to you.

15:33.330 --> 15:35.460
Lucky:
And as I've said
from the beginning,

15:35.460 --> 15:38.420
no more unfair laws!

15:50.000 --> 15:52.120
The voting will commence.

16:04.290 --> 16:06.210
Hey, next year,

16:06.210 --> 16:07.880
I want to be
the ballot box.

16:13.290 --> 16:15.500
You won, Lucky!

16:15.500 --> 16:19.080
You won.
You're the new mayor.

16:19.080 --> 16:21.790
Whoa!
That makes me
vice mayor!

16:21.790 --> 16:22.830
You hear that,
Lucky!

16:22.830 --> 16:25.250
I'm vice mayor,
I'm vice mayor, you guys!

16:25.250 --> 16:28.080
What's a vice mayor do?

16:28.080 --> 16:30.250
Come on, guys.
Let's go find Ed

16:30.250 --> 16:31.420
and rub it in.

16:31.420 --> 16:33.210
I mean...

16:33.210 --> 16:34.830
be good sports.

16:36.330 --> 16:40.750
Well, well, well,
if it isn't the former
Mayor Pig.

16:43.750 --> 16:45.420
What's cooking?

16:45.420 --> 16:48.790
Or should I say
"bacon"?

16:50.830 --> 16:52.670
Now that
the election's over,

16:52.670 --> 16:54.960
I think I'll turn
on the TV

16:54.960 --> 16:57.580
and watch
whatever I want.

16:58.670 --> 17:00.710
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

17:00.710 --> 17:03.290
Well, congratulations, Lucky.

17:03.290 --> 17:05.040
You done beat me.

17:05.040 --> 17:08.210
You're the new mayor
for now.

17:08.210 --> 17:10.290
What's that
supposed to mean?

17:18.250 --> 17:21.000
Lucky:
My first order of business
as the new mayor

17:21.000 --> 17:23.290
is to declare
all of Ed Pig's laws

17:23.290 --> 17:25.330
null and void.

17:25.330 --> 17:27.960
-Every single one.

17:27.960 --> 17:29.880
-Hooray!

17:29.880 --> 17:32.000
Hip hip hooray!

17:32.000 --> 17:33.960
Rolly:
Hip hop hooray!

17:33.960 --> 17:37.080
Man,
this being mayor thing
is a breeze.

17:39.080 --> 17:40.330
Let me guess,

17:40.330 --> 17:42.290
you're here for
your golden horse shoes.

17:42.290 --> 17:45.460
Well, my vice, vice mayor
is right on top of that.

17:45.460 --> 17:49.080
-Cadpig.
-We're in the midst
of a study

17:49.080 --> 17:51.290
regarding the impact
of gold horse shoes

17:51.290 --> 17:52.880
on the environment.

17:52.880 --> 17:55.040
Huh?

17:55.040 --> 17:56.330
Say, Lucky,

17:56.330 --> 17:58.120
when Nanny milked me
this morning,

17:58.120 --> 18:00.750
her hands nearly
froze my utters off.

18:00.750 --> 18:04.750
When are we getting
those heated milking gloves
you promised?

18:04.750 --> 18:07.620
Uh, Vice, Vice,
Vice Mayor Spot

18:07.620 --> 18:09.420
is hard at work
on that.

18:09.420 --> 18:12.120
Oh yeah, and we've got
a finance committee

18:12.120 --> 18:14.380
extrapolating
a feasibility report

18:14.380 --> 18:16.170
on, uh...

18:18.960 --> 18:21.880
-I was hoping you knew.

18:21.880 --> 18:23.540
Hey, Lucky,

18:23.540 --> 18:25.080
when are we getting
those new TVs

18:25.080 --> 18:26.120
you promised us?

18:26.120 --> 18:28.750
Ugh!
I'm working on it.

18:28.750 --> 18:29.920
Okay?!

18:35.170 --> 18:36.830
What's going on?

18:39.580 --> 18:41.290
Mommy!
Are you okay?

18:41.290 --> 18:42.920
No, I'm not okay!

18:42.920 --> 18:44.750
What?
Do you think I like

18:44.750 --> 18:46.290
getting thrown out
on my nuggets?

18:46.290 --> 18:47.960
It's Mooch.

18:47.960 --> 18:50.170
He said you said
he could move into
the hen house.

18:50.170 --> 18:51.710
What's that all about?

18:51.710 --> 18:54.250
Uh, well, as mayor,

18:54.250 --> 18:57.000
I'm turning
this matter

18:57.000 --> 18:59.330
over to my vice, vice
vice mayor

18:59.330 --> 19:02.120
of poultry politics.

19:02.120 --> 19:04.330
-Don't look at me.

19:04.330 --> 19:06.080
This is between
you and Mooch.

19:13.210 --> 19:15.750
What do you think
you're doing, Mooch?

19:15.750 --> 19:17.750
Who said you could
move into the hen house?

19:17.750 --> 19:19.960
-You did.

19:19.960 --> 19:22.920
Yeah, when you threw out
all of Ed Pig's laws.

19:22.920 --> 19:25.710
One of them said
only hens could live
in the hen house.

19:25.710 --> 19:27.380
Well, now,
I'm moving in.

19:27.380 --> 19:29.500
Then I'm declaring
it the law

19:29.500 --> 19:31.960
that only hens
can live in the hen house.

19:34.120 --> 19:35.960
But you promised.

19:35.960 --> 19:38.210
I don't care
what I promised.

19:38.210 --> 19:40.420
I'm the mayor,
and I'm saying

19:40.420 --> 19:42.920
that you can't live
in the hen house.

19:46.120 --> 19:48.250
-Technically speaking...
-Hooray!

19:48.250 --> 19:50.580
Mooch is really the one
with egg on his face.

19:50.580 --> 19:52.830
Thanks, Lucky,
and by the way,

19:52.830 --> 19:54.120
when are we gonna
be getting that

19:54.120 --> 19:55.880
new, bigger
henhouse, huh?

19:55.880 --> 19:58.170
You know, the one
you promised us.

19:58.170 --> 20:01.580
Oh, uh, Vice Mayor Rolly,
how's that coming?

20:01.580 --> 20:03.250
Oh, well, uh...

20:03.250 --> 20:06.920
currently the Henhouse
Enlargement Bill

20:06.920 --> 20:08.580
is stalled
in committee.

20:13.500 --> 20:15.880
Rolly:
We can't keep stalling
for you, Luck.

20:15.880 --> 20:17.580
-The voters want to know...

20:17.580 --> 20:20.290
how you're planning
on keeping all your promises.

20:20.290 --> 20:23.040
Cadpig, would you
stop whistling

20:23.040 --> 20:26.880
before I declare it
illegal again?!

20:26.880 --> 20:29.080
Lucky, Ed Pig's
just called a meeting

20:29.080 --> 20:31.290
to discuss
all the promises
you made.

20:31.290 --> 20:33.210
Well, tell them
it's illegal

20:33.210 --> 20:35.000
to talk about
my promises.

20:35.000 --> 20:37.380
-That doesn't seem fair.
-Who are you to say

20:37.380 --> 20:39.920
what's fair, Spot?
I'm the mayor!

20:39.920 --> 20:42.920
Somebody needs
a little attitude adjustment.

20:42.920 --> 20:44.290
Yeah, Lucky!

20:44.290 --> 20:47.210
Pretty soon
you're gonna be eating
all our ice cream.

20:47.210 --> 20:50.210
And making us watch
whatever shows you want.

20:50.210 --> 20:52.000
And I could
if I wanted to.

20:52.000 --> 20:53.750
I can do
anything I want.

20:53.750 --> 20:56.620
Then you're gonna
have to find yourself

20:56.620 --> 20:58.290
another vice mayor.

20:58.290 --> 20:59.960
And vice, vice mayor.

20:59.960 --> 21:02.380
And vice, vice,
vice mayor too.

21:04.960 --> 21:06.420
Guess I should
just pass a law

21:06.420 --> 21:08.790
saying I'm no better
than Mayor Pig.

21:08.790 --> 21:11.830
You have all heard
my proposal

21:11.830 --> 21:14.000
to remove Mayor Lucky
from office.

21:14.000 --> 21:16.790
So are we
ready to vote?

21:19.750 --> 21:21.880
Excuse me, everyone.

21:21.880 --> 21:22.880
Excuse me.

21:23.920 --> 21:26.170
I thank you all
for voting for me.

21:26.170 --> 21:28.830
However,
I want you to know

21:28.830 --> 21:30.710
that all
the promises I made,

21:30.710 --> 21:33.750
well, I can't keep
any of them.

21:33.750 --> 21:36.790
So there's no reason
to vote me out of office

21:36.790 --> 21:38.580
because I resign.

21:40.540 --> 21:42.250
Lucky, my boy,

21:42.250 --> 21:45.500
your honesty
is admirable.

21:45.500 --> 21:47.750
Thank you, Mayor.

21:51.670 --> 21:53.420
It sure was nice
of Mayor Pig

21:53.420 --> 21:54.880
to give us
this ice cream.

21:54.880 --> 21:57.500
Guess he's not
such a bad guy after all.

21:57.500 --> 21:58.880
There's a warm heart

21:58.880 --> 22:00.920
beneath all those
pork rinds.

22:00.920 --> 22:02.790
After that big
promise mess,

22:02.790 --> 22:06.120
I'm just happy to be done
with my political career.

22:06.120 --> 22:07.500
Glad to hear it, Lucky.

22:07.500 --> 22:08.880
Ha!

22:08.880 --> 22:11.000
I mean everybody knows
the real power

22:11.000 --> 22:12.830
is in big corporations.

22:16.080 --> 22:17.500
Just kidding.
