00:01.302 --> 00:03.604
You're facing your fears
with The Exorcist.

00:03.637 --> 00:06.174
-Unclean spirit!
-In the name of God!

00:06.207 --> 00:07.941
Catch all-new episodes Fridays.

00:07.975 --> 00:09.577
And check out
our other Fox programs--

00:09.610 --> 00:12.146
The Gifted, Lucifer, and Gotham.

00:12.180 --> 00:14.415
I can make a difference, Alfred.
I know I can.

00:14.448 --> 00:15.749
Only on Fox.

00:17.885 --> 00:20.154
-Previously on The Exorcist...
-(screams)

00:20.188 --> 00:21.755
Yeah, they flew
right over my house.

00:21.789 --> 00:22.790
Never seen anything like it.

00:22.823 --> 00:24.125
I thought it'd be nice

00:24.158 --> 00:25.659
if you come down
to dinner tonight and join us.

00:25.693 --> 00:27.228
You could wear your brave face.

00:27.261 --> 00:28.696
(demonic voice):
You think your friend

00:28.729 --> 00:30.098
won't discard you, too?

00:30.131 --> 00:31.765
Father Tomas...

00:31.799 --> 00:33.767
he doesn't need you.

00:33.801 --> 00:35.303
MARCUS:
You think this is a gift

00:35.336 --> 00:37.138
-from God?
-LORRAINE: I also believe

00:37.171 --> 00:39.173
that there is something that's
taken over my little girl,

00:39.207 --> 00:40.308
and it's doing everything
in its power

00:40.341 --> 00:41.542
to destroy her.

00:41.575 --> 00:43.777
-There is nothing wrong
with you. -What?

00:43.811 --> 00:45.513
You lied to us. She's been
in and out of hospitals

00:45.546 --> 00:46.547
since the day she was born.

00:46.580 --> 00:48.616
(Lorraine screams)

00:48.649 --> 00:49.683
(grunts)

00:49.717 --> 00:50.984
TOMAS:
And what's next for her?

00:51.018 --> 00:52.553
I know of a place

00:52.586 --> 00:53.787
that could probably take her in

00:53.821 --> 00:55.089
in the meantime.

00:55.123 --> 00:56.524
I think she'd be safe there.

00:56.557 --> 00:58.659
-Who are you?
-Mouse.

00:58.692 --> 01:00.528
BENNETT: We've both
been fighting the same war.

01:00.561 --> 01:03.063
I believe Caro meant
for us to fight it together.

01:03.097 --> 01:04.565
Meet Sister Dolores.

01:04.598 --> 01:08.001
-Or what's left of her.
-(demonic gasp)

01:08.035 --> 01:09.837
-DOLORES (demonic voice): Uno,
dos, tres. -* Jesus loves me

01:09.870 --> 01:11.004
* This I know

01:11.038 --> 01:12.740
Uno, dos, tres.

01:12.773 --> 01:15.543
* For the Bible tells me so

01:15.576 --> 01:17.878
-Uno, dos, tres.
-* Little ones to Him belong

01:17.911 --> 01:21.149
-Uno, dos, tres.
-* They are weak

01:21.182 --> 01:23.317
What is this music?

01:23.351 --> 01:26.320
Mousey there
thinks it is torture.

01:26.354 --> 01:28.422
-But I love it.
-* Yes, Jesus loves me

01:28.456 --> 01:31.325
Oh, do you?

01:31.359 --> 01:33.327
-(volume increases)
-* Yes, Jesus loves me

01:33.361 --> 01:35.229
Uno, dos, tres.

01:35.263 --> 01:38.366
-Uno, dos, tres.
-* The Bible tells me so

01:38.399 --> 01:40.100
Uno, dos, tres.

01:40.134 --> 01:41.769
Uno,
dos, tres.

01:41.802 --> 01:43.036
Turn it off.

01:43.070 --> 01:44.605
-* Jesus take
-Uno, dos, tres.

01:44.638 --> 01:46.240
* This heart of mine

01:46.274 --> 01:48.209
-Turn it off now.
-(demonic growling)

01:48.242 --> 01:50.678
* Make it pure and holy Thine

01:50.711 --> 01:54.582
Dance with me, Devin.

01:54.615 --> 01:58.118
* I will live henceforth
for Thee. *

01:58.152 --> 01:59.787
Hey.

01:59.820 --> 02:01.289
Do you think
I can borrow your car?

02:01.322 --> 02:03.056
I don't want to miss the ferry.

02:03.090 --> 02:04.758
Of course. Yeah.

02:04.792 --> 02:06.894
Thanks.

02:06.927 --> 02:08.462
-You gonna be okay?
-Yeah.

02:08.496 --> 02:10.764
Harper's really lucky
to have you with her.

02:10.798 --> 02:13.434
Harper should be released
tomorrow by 10:00,

02:13.467 --> 02:14.802
so we'll be back around noon?

02:14.835 --> 02:17.538
Whenever.
We'll have a bed waiting.

02:17.571 --> 02:19.607
Thanks for doing this, Andy.

02:19.640 --> 02:21.475
I would've found her
another bed,

02:21.509 --> 02:22.610
-but there aren't any.
-Yeah, well,

02:22.643 --> 02:23.911
that's what we're here for.

02:23.944 --> 02:25.379
It's better
than a state facility.

02:25.413 --> 02:27.715
Kids always do better
in family-run homes.

02:27.748 --> 02:30.251
If they're actually... open.

02:30.284 --> 02:32.786
And if they are
properly staffed.

02:32.820 --> 02:34.488
Well, I think we're doing okay.

02:34.522 --> 02:36.156
Not according to the State.

02:36.190 --> 02:37.625
A family this size

02:37.658 --> 02:41.161
needs to have
at least two primary caregivers.

02:41.195 --> 02:44.598
Yeah, well,
we had two caregivers.

02:48.636 --> 02:52.306
Could have asked me for help
when you lost her.

02:55.108 --> 02:57.578
Another few days and you won't
have to see me again.

02:57.611 --> 02:59.813
Better get to the hospital.

03:01.849 --> 03:03.150
ANDY:
We're gonna have some company.

03:03.183 --> 03:04.818
Her name is Harper.

03:04.852 --> 03:06.320
She's 12.

03:06.354 --> 03:07.655
Rose is picking her up
from the hospital.

03:07.688 --> 03:08.922
What's wrong with her?

03:08.956 --> 03:10.123
There's nothing wrong with her.

03:10.157 --> 03:11.725
-CALEB: Well, is she sick?
-No, no.

03:11.759 --> 03:14.762
-She's not sick. -Then why
is she at the hospital?

03:14.795 --> 03:16.464
Question. Am I gonna have
to give up my room?

03:16.497 --> 03:18.499
Yes, you're gonna have
to share your room.

03:18.532 --> 03:21.134
-For how long?
-I don't want her to come here.

03:21.168 --> 03:24.272
Guys.

03:24.305 --> 03:26.674
Every one of us
knows what it's like

03:26.707 --> 03:29.209
to have our lives
turned upside down.

03:29.243 --> 03:31.245
We all know what it's like
to feel scared

03:31.279 --> 03:33.013
and helpless.

03:33.046 --> 03:35.983
As long as Harper
is under this roof,

03:36.016 --> 03:38.552
she's family.

03:38.586 --> 03:41.622
'Cause good families
only get bigger.

03:41.655 --> 03:44.057
Am I clear?

03:44.091 --> 03:45.693
I don't want to.

03:45.726 --> 03:47.395
I said, are we clear on that?

04:00.040 --> 04:03.477
Truck, it's... it's fine.

04:03.511 --> 04:05.546
He's stressed.
He's dealing with it.

04:05.579 --> 04:10.050
Let Andy do his thing, okay?

04:10.083 --> 04:11.819
Grace, come on.

04:11.852 --> 04:13.587
(door creaks, slams)

04:30.237 --> 04:31.739
Hey.

04:31.772 --> 04:35.343
Gracie.

04:35.376 --> 04:37.210
What are you doing out here?
Hey.

04:37.244 --> 04:40.247
Hey.
What are you doing out here?

04:40.280 --> 04:41.615
What are you doing out here?

04:43.584 --> 04:46.620
She shouldn't be here.

04:46.654 --> 04:49.222
Who shouldn't be here?

04:49.256 --> 04:50.924
(rumbling)

04:53.293 --> 04:54.395
Andy.

04:54.428 --> 04:55.729
I'm scared.

04:55.763 --> 04:57.631
It was just the wind.

04:57.665 --> 04:59.767
Just the wind.

04:59.800 --> 05:01.902
It's all right.

05:05.673 --> 05:09.109
*

05:39.840 --> 05:42.543
(phone ringing)

05:44.745 --> 05:47.648
Hello.

05:47.681 --> 05:49.116
Olivia, it's me.

05:50.551 --> 05:52.285
Tomas.

05:52.319 --> 05:54.955
I've called everyone, but no one
will tell me where you are.

05:54.988 --> 05:56.457
I'm-I'm fine.
I'm fine, I'm fine.

05:56.490 --> 05:57.658
I'm safe, I promise.

05:57.691 --> 05:59.126
Por favor, I'm your sister.

05:59.159 --> 06:01.361
Whatever is going on,
you can tell me.

06:04.598 --> 06:06.800
How is Luis, is-is he okay?

06:06.834 --> 06:08.602
Did you forget
what last week was?

06:10.638 --> 06:13.707
(sighs)
Su cumpleaños.

06:13.741 --> 06:16.343
The whole day, I told him
not to get his hopes up,

06:16.376 --> 06:18.879
but he was so sure
that you were gonna come home

06:18.912 --> 06:20.648
or at least pick up the phone.

06:20.681 --> 06:22.950
Perdóname... perdóname...

06:22.983 --> 06:24.151
I'm sorry.

06:24.184 --> 06:26.720
Listen,

06:26.754 --> 06:29.289
Tomas, there were a bunch
of guys who came by the house

06:29.322 --> 06:31.058
the other day,
asking about you.

06:33.093 --> 06:34.828
What kind of guys?

06:34.862 --> 06:36.930
They said they were
from the Church.

06:37.965 --> 06:39.833
I have to go.

06:39.867 --> 06:41.735
No, Tomas, you have to tell me

06:41.769 --> 06:43.571
-where you are.
-Olivia, I'm sorry.

06:43.604 --> 06:46.507
Tomas, please, please,
can you just come home?

06:46.540 --> 06:47.675
I love you.

06:47.708 --> 06:49.977
Toma-- Tomas?

07:11.565 --> 07:12.833
Stop fidgeting.

07:12.866 --> 07:14.735
I'm not fidgeting.

07:14.768 --> 07:17.938
Somebody's looking for us.

07:17.971 --> 07:21.308
A few men tried
to talk to my sister.

07:21.341 --> 07:23.644
What's our next move?

07:23.677 --> 07:27.915
There is no next move.

07:27.948 --> 07:29.783
There's still no word
from Bennett.

07:29.817 --> 07:32.185
What does that mean?

07:32.219 --> 07:33.921
It means we're on our own.

07:35.956 --> 07:38.258
God will show us the way.

07:38.291 --> 07:41.294
Like he led us to Harper Graham?

07:41.328 --> 07:45.065
I was... wrong about Harper.

07:45.098 --> 07:47.601
Maybe you were wrong about God.

07:49.570 --> 07:51.004
So, what should we do?

07:51.038 --> 07:55.408
Give up?
Stop listening?

07:55.442 --> 07:57.678
Do you hear anything?

07:57.711 --> 07:59.146
Anything at all?

08:01.148 --> 08:03.450
'Cause I certainly don't.

08:06.820 --> 08:09.823
We should get ready.

08:09.857 --> 08:13.393
Rose and Harper
will be here soon.

08:13.426 --> 08:14.628
(birds squawking)

08:14.662 --> 08:18.098
PETER (sighs):
Huh.

08:19.867 --> 08:21.401
Poor little guys.

08:21.434 --> 08:22.803
Poor nothing.

08:22.836 --> 08:25.005
Peter, you should have
seen it yesterday.

08:25.038 --> 08:26.373
I must have burned
30 of these things.

08:26.406 --> 08:28.576
Looks like they died
pretty quick, broke their necks.

08:28.609 --> 08:30.377
They didn't suffer
and if you got to go...

08:31.411 --> 08:33.847
Nah, they're a bad omen.

08:33.881 --> 08:35.949
Of what?

08:35.983 --> 08:37.618
Global warming.

08:37.651 --> 08:39.319
Puget Sound is a truck stop

08:39.352 --> 08:41.955
on the Pacific Flyway
migration path.

08:41.989 --> 08:44.424
You know, it warms up,
messes with their GPS, so...

08:44.457 --> 08:46.727
I'll run some tests, but I think
they probably just got lost.

08:46.760 --> 08:48.328
What about the lamb?

08:48.361 --> 08:51.164
The, uh, the Holstroms
had a baby lamb born sick.

08:52.399 --> 08:54.434
Not sick.

08:54.467 --> 08:55.869
All right, deformed.

08:55.903 --> 08:57.871
Like, real messed up.

08:57.905 --> 09:00.908
Well, that happens.

09:00.941 --> 09:02.475
But I'll,
I'll take some samples,

09:02.509 --> 09:04.177
check around the island. Okay?

09:04.211 --> 09:06.379
But as a friend?
Don't lose any sleep.

09:06.413 --> 09:07.848
ANDY:
Thank you, Peter.

09:07.881 --> 09:09.316
Appreciate it.
I owe you a growler.

09:09.349 --> 09:11.251
-Just make sure it's not an IPA.
Hmm? -You got it.

09:11.284 --> 09:13.987
See ya, Shelbs.

09:14.021 --> 09:15.555
See? No omens.

09:15.589 --> 09:17.324
Just science.

09:17.357 --> 09:18.491
Is that what you believe?

09:18.525 --> 09:19.893
Really?

09:19.927 --> 09:21.662
Yes. I do.

09:21.695 --> 09:25.265
I didn't mean to hurt you, Andy.

09:27.267 --> 09:29.302
But I'm scared.

09:29.336 --> 09:31.605
(chuckles softly)
Don't be.

09:31.639 --> 09:32.740
Okay?

09:32.773 --> 09:34.507
Hey, we're safe here.

09:34.541 --> 09:36.243
I promise.

09:36.276 --> 09:38.445
Come on.

09:41.949 --> 09:43.917
-Hello, Harper.
-Hi.

09:43.951 --> 09:45.452
Father Marcus!

09:45.485 --> 09:47.254
ROSE:
Not so fast, Harper.

09:47.287 --> 09:49.022
Remember what the doctor said.

09:49.056 --> 09:50.891
Sunshine becomes you, m'duck.

09:50.924 --> 09:52.359
Hmm.

09:52.392 --> 09:54.327
You excited about
seeing the island?

09:54.361 --> 09:55.528
Yeah.

09:55.562 --> 09:57.831
Thank you again for doing this.

09:57.865 --> 10:00.100
It was a really rough night.

10:00.133 --> 10:01.902
She kept asking
for the two of you.

10:01.935 --> 10:03.771
And she wouldn't even leave
the hospital until I told her

10:03.804 --> 10:05.238
we were coming to see you.

10:05.272 --> 10:08.842
Not a problem.
We're... very happy to help.

10:08.876 --> 10:10.911
Thank you.

10:10.944 --> 10:13.613
Come on, Harper.

10:13.647 --> 10:15.883
No rush.
We'll be outside.

10:22.622 --> 10:23.891
She likes you.

10:23.924 --> 10:26.426
Yeah, well,
I'm terribly charming.

10:28.929 --> 10:31.732
Thank you.

10:31.765 --> 10:33.200
I owe Harper this.

10:33.233 --> 10:36.203
I nearly made a mistake
with her.

10:36.236 --> 10:39.306
Yeah, well, she's fine.
Isn't she?

10:39.339 --> 10:41.675
We got her out of her home,
right?

10:43.176 --> 10:44.511
Come on.

10:44.544 --> 10:46.346
Let's get her settled.

10:48.548 --> 10:50.617
What is this?

10:50.650 --> 10:52.052
Holy ash.

10:52.085 --> 10:54.988
Ground from the bones of saints.

10:55.022 --> 10:57.691
It's amazing what
you can find in old crypts.

10:57.725 --> 11:00.928
Protection-- for us, from her.

11:02.796 --> 11:05.332
MOUSE: All of this,
it's weakening her.

11:05.365 --> 11:07.968
She can't play any
of her little tricks here.

11:08.001 --> 11:10.137
You disgrace her memory.

11:10.170 --> 11:11.905
Sister Dolores Navarro

11:11.939 --> 11:14.307
was one of the Church's
finest exorcists.

11:14.341 --> 11:17.110
MOUSE: And now she's dead,
courtesy of that same Church.

11:17.144 --> 11:19.279
That demon is integrated.

11:23.784 --> 11:25.318
(demonic voice):
Did they cut you?

11:25.352 --> 11:27.755
Drain your life?

11:36.696 --> 11:39.967
In nomine Patris,

11:40.000 --> 11:43.670
-et Filii et Spiritus Sancti...
-(laughing)

11:43.703 --> 11:44.872
You can't exorcise her.

11:44.905 --> 11:47.507
She deserves to be at peace.

11:47.540 --> 11:49.877
She doesn't exist anymore.

11:49.910 --> 11:53.113
I was with Dolores in Ecuador,
after the earthquake.

11:53.146 --> 11:55.048
Two weeks we spent,

11:55.082 --> 11:56.884
digging through the mud
for survivors.

11:56.917 --> 12:00.553
I watched that woman work,
day and night,

12:00.587 --> 12:02.655
without rest, without food,
hoping to save

12:02.689 --> 12:04.825
just one more.

12:04.858 --> 12:07.560
You think I didn't love her?

12:07.594 --> 12:11.164
Don't talk to me about what
she deserves, Father Bennett.

12:11.198 --> 12:12.966
I know full well.

12:13.000 --> 12:14.968
Then why keep her alive?

12:16.636 --> 12:18.906
'Cause that thing
knows the names

12:18.939 --> 12:20.740
of some of the vermin
in Vatican City.

12:20.774 --> 12:23.243
That's how I found out
about your friend the cardinal.

12:23.276 --> 12:25.745
And the three bishops
I roasted before him.

12:25.779 --> 12:27.680
And I think
she's got more to tell.

12:27.714 --> 12:29.382
And what if you're wrong?

12:29.416 --> 12:31.551
What if she's still
in there, somewhere?

12:31.584 --> 12:34.121
No one comes back
from integration.

12:34.154 --> 12:36.156
I've seen it happen.

12:36.189 --> 12:38.025
Six months ago, in Chicago.

12:38.058 --> 12:41.194
Two priests exorcized
an integrated woman.

12:41.228 --> 12:42.595
It could change everything.

12:42.629 --> 12:44.597
Maybe there's hope
to save the integrated.

12:44.631 --> 12:47.034
Then the rumors are true.

12:47.067 --> 12:51.004
The demons have been talking.

12:51.038 --> 12:53.907
Your friends kicked up
one hell of a hornet's nest.

12:53.941 --> 12:56.243
Then they're in even more
danger than I thought.

12:56.276 --> 12:57.510
We're all in danger.

12:57.544 --> 13:00.213
They're targeting exorcists.

13:00.247 --> 13:02.883
Turning the ones they can
and killing the rest.

13:02.916 --> 13:05.785
For 2,000 years,
we've been the only thing

13:05.819 --> 13:07.220
standing in their way.

13:07.254 --> 13:09.890
The war's not coming,
Father Bennett,

13:09.923 --> 13:11.558
it's already here.

13:13.693 --> 13:15.095
And we're losing.

13:30.610 --> 13:31.578
Good try, buddy.

13:31.611 --> 13:32.645
Wait, I got it in, right?

13:32.679 --> 13:34.081
-Yeah, you did.
-So, did I win?

13:34.114 --> 13:35.782
-You're winning, you're winning.
-Okay, so...

13:35.815 --> 13:37.484
All right, Caleb, here you go,
so you just grab it by the end.

13:37.517 --> 13:38.919
-CALEB: Like that?
-SHELBY: Right here, right here.

13:38.952 --> 13:40.320
No, you can't go again,
it's not your turn.

13:40.353 --> 13:41.821
-But I'm winning.
-Hey, that was close.

13:41.855 --> 13:43.356
(posh accent):
Cheers, Princess.

13:43.390 --> 13:45.392
-(giggles)
-Thank you.

13:45.425 --> 13:47.360
(chatter outside)

13:47.394 --> 13:49.296
Mmm. Delicious.

13:50.263 --> 13:52.966
(indistinct chatter)

13:53.000 --> 13:55.768
Do you want to take this
tea party downstairs?

13:55.802 --> 13:58.571
Maybe some of the other
kids want to play.

13:58.605 --> 14:01.074
I just want to play with you.

14:01.108 --> 14:03.810
You love them more than me.

14:03.843 --> 14:06.646
That's not true,
I love you all the same.

14:06.679 --> 14:08.848
This much.

14:08.882 --> 14:09.883
(laughs)

14:11.551 --> 14:13.453
I do want you to come down
and meet Harper

14:13.486 --> 14:14.955
when she gets here,
though, okay?

14:14.988 --> 14:16.957
I don't want to.

14:16.990 --> 14:18.491
You can wear your disguise.

14:18.525 --> 14:21.394
I said, I don't want to.

14:25.032 --> 14:26.466
Grace, honey,
who are you talking to?

14:26.499 --> 14:28.501
No one.

14:42.149 --> 14:43.216
You okay?

14:43.250 --> 14:45.052
Grace?

14:45.085 --> 14:47.720
What happened?

14:49.556 --> 14:50.690
(low hissing)

14:54.694 --> 14:57.497
Okay.

14:57.530 --> 14:58.731
Got it?

15:00.600 --> 15:02.435
-Isn't it beautiful here?
-Uh-huh.

15:05.472 --> 15:07.607
(ghostly whispering)

15:17.050 --> 15:20.420
Andy-- he's great.

15:20.453 --> 15:22.822
The kids are awesome.

15:22.855 --> 15:26.059
You're gonna really love them.

15:26.093 --> 15:27.760
Hey.

15:27.794 --> 15:29.963
You know, when I was your age,

15:29.997 --> 15:33.600
I was in foster care
for a little while, too.

15:33.633 --> 15:35.735
-You were?
-Mm-hmm.

15:37.770 --> 15:40.707
Trust me, this is
a really special home.

15:44.177 --> 15:47.614
You'll be safe here
while we get your mom some help.

15:47.647 --> 15:51.784
(indistinct chatter)

16:08.701 --> 16:11.104
Harper, come on.

16:11.138 --> 16:14.074
Harper, this is Andy.

16:14.107 --> 16:15.942
He'll be looking after you
for a little bit.

16:15.975 --> 16:17.177
Hey, Harper.

16:17.210 --> 16:18.911
It's really nice to meet you.

16:18.945 --> 16:21.114
I'm Andy.

16:31.191 --> 16:33.026
Rose tells me you like to draw.
Is that right?

16:33.060 --> 16:34.627
This is perfect,

16:34.661 --> 16:37.797
'cause I got a billion gallons
of paint in there.

16:37.830 --> 16:39.666
I'm a terrible artist.
I thought maybe after dinner,

16:39.699 --> 16:41.734
we could bust out some brushes,
you could help me?

16:43.270 --> 16:45.238
Yes.

16:45.272 --> 16:47.674
There's a tall guy,
and he's got a black jacket

16:47.707 --> 16:49.576
and short hair.

16:49.609 --> 16:51.444
And a mustache.

16:51.478 --> 16:54.781
But not like a pornstache.

16:54.814 --> 16:56.816
Like, a good stache.

16:56.849 --> 16:58.851
Is that guy a priest?

16:58.885 --> 17:01.521
SHELBY:
I heard they both are.

17:01.554 --> 17:03.656
ANDY:
Verity?

17:03.690 --> 17:06.326
This is Verity.

17:06.359 --> 17:07.660
This is Harper.

17:07.694 --> 17:10.563
She has graciously agreed
to share her room with you.

17:10.597 --> 17:12.565
Verity, would you mind
taking Harper upstairs

17:12.599 --> 17:14.000
and showing her the ropes?

17:14.033 --> 17:15.602
-VERITY: Sure.
-ANDY: Awesome.

17:15.635 --> 17:16.869
VERITY:
Come on, Fish.

17:16.903 --> 17:19.038
Your cell awaits.

17:20.373 --> 17:22.008
Harper's heroes.

17:22.041 --> 17:23.476
Andrew Kim. Andy.

17:23.510 --> 17:25.345
-It's an honor.
-We're not heroes, no.

17:25.378 --> 17:26.646
Don't listen to him. I am.

17:26.679 --> 17:28.181
I knew it.
(laughs)

17:28.215 --> 17:30.583
Just a little leaf there, buddy.

17:30.617 --> 17:32.252
-Thank you, Mom.
-(chuckles)

17:32.285 --> 17:33.453
ANDY: All right,
come on in, come on in.

17:33.486 --> 17:35.455
*

17:42.829 --> 17:44.697
(rumbling)

18:04.351 --> 18:06.519
Welcome. If you want
to put the bags there,

18:06.553 --> 18:08.555
I'll-I'll take 'em up
in a minute.

18:08.588 --> 18:11.891
TOMAS:
This house, it's beautiful.

18:11.924 --> 18:14.561
Thank you.
Yeah, it's a, it's a beast.

18:14.594 --> 18:16.363
Belonged to my wife's
Great Aunt Peggy.

18:16.396 --> 18:17.730
And your wife is...?

18:17.764 --> 18:20.333
(clicks tongue)
Not with us anymore.

18:22.001 --> 18:23.503
I'm sorry.

18:23.536 --> 18:24.937
Thank you. Um...

18:24.971 --> 18:27.240
who wants a grand tour?

18:29.108 --> 18:31.711
ANDY: I mean, I wore, like,
an eye patch for a week.

18:31.744 --> 18:33.446
I stopped growing jalapeños
after that.

18:33.480 --> 18:35.348
It's way too easy for pranks.

18:35.382 --> 18:36.483
Stinging nettles.

18:36.516 --> 18:38.117
They were my weapon of choice.

18:38.151 --> 18:41.654
One of the older kids
comes sniffing around for blood,

18:41.688 --> 18:43.456
stick a bunch of stingers
in his trousers

18:43.490 --> 18:44.757
while he's asleep.

18:44.791 --> 18:46.693
24 hours of vile agony.

18:46.726 --> 18:48.094
You were in a home?

18:48.127 --> 18:51.731
Yeah, but not... not like this.

18:51.764 --> 18:55.602
150 boys under a single roof.

18:55.635 --> 18:57.404
How long were you there?

18:57.437 --> 18:59.572
Long enough.

19:02.475 --> 19:05.278
What happened here?

19:05.312 --> 19:08.981
A bunch of crows dive-bombed
the house, out of nowhere.

19:16.088 --> 19:19.058
-Hmm.
-Shall we?

19:26.299 --> 19:28.901
VERITY:
Retro digs, huh?

19:28.935 --> 19:32.305
The bathroom situation
is barbaric,

19:32.339 --> 19:35.342
but the shower's hot
if you get there first.

19:35.375 --> 19:38.010
Which-- protip-- you should.

19:38.044 --> 19:40.280
Um, the Wi-Fi's patchy,

19:40.313 --> 19:44.183
and Truck is almost always
RPG-ing anyhow,

19:44.217 --> 19:48.521
so... good luck
streaming anything.

19:48.555 --> 19:53.493
But, Andy is
a fair-to-decent cook.

19:53.526 --> 19:57.597
He's... relatively woke.

19:57.630 --> 19:59.399
And...

20:01.401 --> 20:03.403
...he's safe.

20:04.471 --> 20:07.073
No one's gonna hurt you anymore.

20:07.106 --> 20:09.175
Not here.

20:11.177 --> 20:13.246
I promise.

20:17.984 --> 20:20.287
Here.

20:20.320 --> 20:22.289
This is for you.

20:24.757 --> 20:28.227
I made it when I heard
you were coming.

20:28.261 --> 20:30.663
So, if you get scared,

20:30.697 --> 20:32.932
you can click it on
from your bed with this thing.

20:32.965 --> 20:35.435
(switch clicks)

20:38.705 --> 20:41.173
And it changes color.

20:43.276 --> 20:45.244
(switch clicks)

20:45.278 --> 20:47.213
(both chuckle softly)

20:47.246 --> 20:49.849
VERITY:
No, see, it changed color.

20:49.882 --> 20:52.051
It's... it's fine.

20:52.084 --> 20:53.853
I'll fix that.

20:53.886 --> 20:56.155
-(rumbling) -The top's just a
tin can with some spray paint...

20:58.691 --> 21:00.860
*

21:19.446 --> 21:22.114
(creaking)

21:22.148 --> 21:24.817
(footsteps running away)

21:28.955 --> 21:30.423
(floorboard creaks)

21:42.335 --> 21:44.937
SHELBY:
Father?

21:44.971 --> 21:47.239
-Tomas.
-Shelby.

21:47.273 --> 21:49.075
-Hi.
-Hi.

21:49.108 --> 21:51.277
Uh, you should know, I'm...
I'm a believer.

21:51.310 --> 21:54.514
-Not, like, Catholic,
or anything, but... -Ah.

21:54.547 --> 21:56.215
-No offense.
-Oh, no.

21:56.248 --> 21:57.884
We're all searching
for the same answers.

21:57.917 --> 22:00.553
Yeah.

22:00.587 --> 22:02.522
What can I do for you?

22:02.555 --> 22:05.625
Why are you guys here?

22:05.658 --> 22:08.928
Well, making sure
Harper is okay.

22:08.961 --> 22:12.264
And is that the only reason?

22:12.298 --> 22:15.101
What other reason
would there be?

22:15.134 --> 22:18.004
Father Tomas.

22:18.037 --> 22:19.806
It was good to meet you, Father.

22:26.045 --> 22:28.515
Father Marcus
is looking for you.

22:33.920 --> 22:36.288
I think she'll be happy here.

22:39.191 --> 22:41.561
You all right?

22:41.594 --> 22:46.198
One of the kids tried
to tell me something.

22:46.232 --> 22:48.868
I think
there's something wrong here.

22:48.901 --> 22:51.037
I feel it.

22:51.070 --> 22:53.840
You feel what?

22:53.873 --> 22:56.308
I thought I was wrong
about Harper,

22:56.342 --> 22:59.679
but now I don't know.

23:03.516 --> 23:06.486
Well, I guess
I could have a look around.

23:06.519 --> 23:09.656

23:19.231 --> 23:22.034
(thudding)

23:30.710 --> 23:34.246
What is that?

23:34.280 --> 23:38.551
Uh, that is
a Pacific blackdragon.

23:38.585 --> 23:40.487
It's a female.

23:40.520 --> 23:43.556
You can tell by this barbel.

23:43.590 --> 23:45.725
It glows to lure in its prey.

23:45.758 --> 23:47.126
Ambush predator.

23:47.159 --> 23:48.561
Strictly deep water.

23:48.595 --> 23:50.096
Well, what's it doing here?

23:50.129 --> 23:52.865
Yeah. (groans)

23:52.899 --> 23:54.567
That is the question.

23:54.601 --> 23:58.304
"Fish and Wildlife."

23:58.337 --> 24:01.073
A neighbor told me you had some
trouble with birds. Andrew Kim?

24:01.107 --> 24:04.110
-You're not from around here.
-How'd you guess?

24:04.143 --> 24:05.712
If you were,
you'd call him Andy.

24:05.745 --> 24:07.947
What's your business
with that family?

24:07.980 --> 24:10.517
His new foster child, Harper--

24:10.550 --> 24:12.384
my partner and I
brought her here.

24:12.418 --> 24:14.053
You're one of the priests?

24:14.086 --> 24:15.755
I used to be.

24:15.788 --> 24:17.790
What are you now?

24:17.824 --> 24:20.527
God knows.

24:20.560 --> 24:24.030
-(labored breathing)
-* Jesus loves me, this I know

24:24.063 --> 24:27.800
* For the Bible tells me so

24:27.834 --> 24:31.704
* Little ones to Him belong

24:31.738 --> 24:35.708
* They are weak,
but He is strong *

24:35.742 --> 24:39.311
* Yes, Jesus loves me

24:39.345 --> 24:42.715
* Yes,
Jesus loves me *

24:42.749 --> 24:46.553
* Yes, Jesus loves me

24:46.586 --> 24:49.622
* The Bible tells me so.

24:51.658 --> 24:53.660
(music stops)

24:56.863 --> 24:59.331
What's your name?

25:01.000 --> 25:03.302
Your real name.

25:03.335 --> 25:06.305
(demonic voice):
Mejis.

25:06.338 --> 25:08.507
It's beautiful.

25:08.541 --> 25:10.977
Just like the angel
you once were.

25:11.010 --> 25:13.613
Our Father must have loved you,
to name you so.

25:13.646 --> 25:15.948
Until your kind came along.

25:15.982 --> 25:19.586
Then He forgot about us.

25:19.619 --> 25:22.822
Dolores, if there's
any part of you still in there,

25:22.855 --> 25:27.193
anything left to be saved,
then give me a sign.

25:28.761 --> 25:31.631
There is your sign,
man of Christ.

25:31.664 --> 25:35.234
The days of the exorcist
are over.

25:59.358 --> 26:00.760
Mm.

26:02.428 --> 26:05.031
She is going to find you,
you know.

26:05.064 --> 26:07.366
First you,

26:07.399 --> 26:11.070
then the old gray lion
and his little cub.

26:11.103 --> 26:12.271
Who?

26:12.304 --> 26:13.873
Give me a name.

26:13.906 --> 26:17.076
You already know her name.

26:17.109 --> 26:19.545
You met her in Chicago.

26:28.855 --> 26:29.922
(shouts)

26:29.956 --> 26:31.257
(groaning)

26:31.290 --> 26:32.424
(growls)

26:32.458 --> 26:33.993
(yelling)

26:34.026 --> 26:36.696
She sends her regards.

26:41.868 --> 26:43.535
(Bennett grunting)

26:43.569 --> 26:45.237
(shouts)

26:45.271 --> 26:46.873
(Dolores shouting)

26:53.412 --> 26:55.547
(Dolores yells)

26:55.581 --> 26:57.984
That's what your mercy gets you.

26:59.251 --> 27:01.620
BENNETT:
What did you give her?

27:01.654 --> 27:02.922
MOUSE:
Holy water.

27:02.955 --> 27:04.757
-It was just a little.
-(coughing)

27:04.791 --> 27:06.025
You all right?

27:06.058 --> 27:08.027
I'm fine.

27:09.796 --> 27:12.464
I said I'm fine.

27:12.498 --> 27:15.702
What was she talking about,
the old gray lion and the cub?

27:15.735 --> 27:17.436
If you heard all that,
why'd you let her attack me?

27:17.469 --> 27:19.271
Well, you learned
your lesson, didn't you?

27:19.305 --> 27:21.407
Are you mad? I'm on your side.

27:21.440 --> 27:23.242
The lion and the cub.

27:23.275 --> 27:25.644
The two priests I told you of.

27:25.678 --> 27:28.047
Tomas Ortega and Marcus Keane.

27:29.348 --> 27:31.483
Marcus Keane?

27:31.517 --> 27:32.952
Do you know where they are?

27:32.985 --> 27:34.420
Not anymore.

27:34.453 --> 27:35.922
I told them to go into hiding.

27:35.955 --> 27:37.323
We broke contact.

27:37.356 --> 27:39.826
And what about this group
in Chicago?

27:39.859 --> 27:41.861
They're the ones responsible
for the attack on the Pope?

27:41.894 --> 27:43.329
Controlled
by an integrated demon

27:43.362 --> 27:45.264
who took over the body
of Maria Walters.

27:45.297 --> 27:48.500
She tried to have me
integrated, too.

27:48.534 --> 27:50.202
If we could get our hands
on a demon

27:50.236 --> 27:53.840
with that level of influence
and power...

27:53.873 --> 27:55.607
Then we might be able

27:55.641 --> 27:59.779
to get the names of those at
the very top of the infestation.

27:59.812 --> 28:02.614
And stop them
before they stop us.

28:02.648 --> 28:06.953
It's not just, uh,
fish and birds, it's...

28:06.986 --> 28:09.621
sick livestock, too,
birth defects.

28:09.655 --> 28:12.091
And on more than one farm,
as it turns out.

28:12.124 --> 28:14.393
Must be some kind of toxin, uh,

28:14.426 --> 28:16.028
Fukushima runoff.

28:16.062 --> 28:18.164
This island has
a lot of odd stories.

28:18.197 --> 28:21.834
If I had any questions
about the island...?

28:21.868 --> 28:23.870
You asking for my number?

28:25.204 --> 28:27.073
Kidding.
(chuckles)

28:27.106 --> 28:29.208
I'm, uh, Peter,
by the way. Sorry.

28:29.241 --> 28:32.511
Uh, Marcus.

28:32.544 --> 28:37.884
So, uh, why'd you, uh,
leave the Church, Marcus?

28:37.917 --> 28:40.352
Insubordination.

28:40.386 --> 28:41.587
You miss it?

28:41.620 --> 28:43.189
The Church, no.

28:43.222 --> 28:44.891
Just God.

28:44.924 --> 28:47.393
Isn't He everywhere?

28:47.426 --> 28:49.395
Some places less than most.

28:49.428 --> 28:52.364
That some sort of a lapsed
Catholic thing, or...?

28:52.398 --> 28:54.700
No, no, no, I'm...
I haven't lost my faith,

28:54.733 --> 28:59.906
it's, uh...
nothing as clichéd as that.

28:59.939 --> 29:02.341
Whatever you have lost,
you'll find it here.

29:02.374 --> 29:05.544
Under the sky, order and chaos.

29:05.577 --> 29:07.880
Death and creation.

29:07.914 --> 29:10.149
You, uh, you sail?

29:10.182 --> 29:11.851
Me? A lad from the Midlands?

29:11.884 --> 29:13.052
(laughing):
God, no.

29:13.085 --> 29:15.121
The sun alone would do me in.

29:15.154 --> 29:18.825
It's too bad, there's this
condor's nest on Jarrell Cove.

29:18.858 --> 29:24.096
Strictly off limits, except for
humble Fish and Wildlife agents

29:24.130 --> 29:25.364
like myself.

29:28.534 --> 29:31.270
Maybe some other time.

29:34.440 --> 29:36.275
ROSE:
Thank you again.

29:36.308 --> 29:40.246
I promise you, Harper will be
in good hands here.

29:41.280 --> 29:43.883
It seems like a lovely family.

29:43.916 --> 29:45.885
Hey, Father.

29:45.918 --> 29:47.586
Don't go just yet.
You should be here for this.

29:47.619 --> 29:48.988
We got a little ritual.

29:49.021 --> 29:50.656
Come on.

29:52.992 --> 29:55.261
ANDY:
All right. We're all here.

29:55.294 --> 29:56.662
You ready?

29:56.695 --> 29:59.031
-HARPER: I guess.
-ANDY: All right, come on.

30:03.535 --> 30:05.571
Anywhere you like.

30:12.979 --> 30:15.281
-Hey! (chuckles)
-(applause)

30:16.849 --> 30:18.650
Hey.

30:18.684 --> 30:20.486
Now you're family.

30:20.519 --> 30:22.788
No matter what happens,
you always have a home here.

30:22.821 --> 30:24.823
Okay?

30:30.762 --> 30:32.764
(distant children's laughter)

30:45.211 --> 30:47.346
(music playing faintly)

30:49.448 --> 30:51.083
Cool, right?

30:51.117 --> 30:52.518
What's your color?

30:52.551 --> 30:54.720
I don't know.

30:54.753 --> 30:57.256
My mom never let me
paint my nails.

30:57.289 --> 30:58.824
No offense,

30:58.857 --> 31:01.393
your mom kind of sounds
like a bitch and a half.

31:05.965 --> 31:08.200
Is it okay that I miss her?

31:10.069 --> 31:12.238
Yeah.

31:12.271 --> 31:14.974
Yeah, that's okay.

31:26.352 --> 31:29.922
ANDY:
Hey. Have you seen Harper?

31:29.956 --> 31:33.059
(Harper speaking indistinctly)

31:33.092 --> 31:36.328
You know, most children
with that kind of trauma

31:36.362 --> 31:39.031
don't even make eye contact
at this stage.

31:41.200 --> 31:44.170
Verity really stepped up.

31:44.203 --> 31:46.572
After Nikki.

31:48.740 --> 31:51.410
Um...

31:51.443 --> 31:54.680
Nikki was this real punk
as a kid.

31:54.713 --> 31:57.349
And they just got each other.

31:57.383 --> 32:00.752
I think Verity never...
she never had that.

32:00.786 --> 32:04.991
You know? Somebody who loved her
just the way she was.

32:05.024 --> 32:07.793
Sounds like she was a great mom.

32:09.128 --> 32:12.664
I never really get
to talk about her.

32:12.698 --> 32:15.167
Everyone's afraid
to mention her name.

32:16.969 --> 32:19.171
You were wrong, before.

32:19.205 --> 32:21.974
I don't want you to leave.

32:23.409 --> 32:26.178
I mean, when this is over,

32:26.212 --> 32:29.248
I would like to see you again.

32:35.054 --> 32:37.689
*

33:01.613 --> 33:03.449
Andy?

33:10.356 --> 33:12.558
Truck, is that you?

33:15.927 --> 33:19.431
(bones crackling)

33:24.703 --> 33:27.073
(gasping)

33:52.698 --> 33:53.699
(Harper shrieking)

33:56.968 --> 33:58.770
ROSE:
Harper!

33:58.804 --> 34:00.872
Harper! Harper!

34:00.906 --> 34:02.874
-It's just a dream.
-HARPER: It's her.

34:02.908 --> 34:04.843
It's her, it's her. It's Mommy.

34:04.876 --> 34:06.712
N-N-N-N-No,
it's-it's just a dream.

34:06.745 --> 34:08.980
You're here, you're safe.

34:09.014 --> 34:10.816
(panting):
Don't go.

34:10.849 --> 34:12.818
Rose, please.

34:12.851 --> 34:14.320
(panting)

34:14.353 --> 34:15.887
I won't.

34:15.921 --> 34:17.923
Promise.

34:27.899 --> 34:31.637
-Hey.
-Hey.

34:31.670 --> 34:34.072
There's no wine here.
I looked.

34:34.106 --> 34:37.543
Yeah, well, there's
a social worker in the house.

34:37.576 --> 34:38.944
How about chocolate?

34:38.977 --> 34:40.412
Yeah?

34:43.615 --> 34:48.019
You're gonna laugh at me,
but I had this nightmare.

34:48.053 --> 34:50.322
You know how
those stick with you?

34:50.356 --> 34:53.058
Uh, yeah.

34:53.091 --> 34:55.093
I really do.

34:58.464 --> 35:00.432
You want to talk about it?

35:00.466 --> 35:01.833
No.

35:01.867 --> 35:04.436
No, not really.

35:04.470 --> 35:06.138
(whispers):
Okay.

35:06.172 --> 35:08.707
Harper cried herself to sleep.

35:08.740 --> 35:11.377
And all I could do was hold her.

35:11.410 --> 35:14.045
Sometimes that's all they need.

35:14.079 --> 35:18.250
I had 130 active families
last year.

35:18.284 --> 35:22.321
I get too attached to one kid,
another gets hurt.

35:22.354 --> 35:25.324
I can't afford to do
warm and fuzzy.

35:25.357 --> 35:26.925
I mean, look at me.

35:26.958 --> 35:30.429
I am.

35:32.298 --> 35:34.266
I should have kissed you back.

35:34.300 --> 35:36.702
That night on the roof.

35:36.735 --> 35:39.571
But I was so screwed up
over Paul.

35:39.605 --> 35:41.139
And then, when I wasn't...

35:41.173 --> 35:43.575
I was with Nikki.

35:43.609 --> 35:45.944
For a long time,
I was kicking myself.

35:45.977 --> 35:48.146
And then I started kicking you.

35:48.180 --> 35:50.582
You weren't the only one
that was mad.

35:50.616 --> 35:52.984
I lost my friend.

35:53.018 --> 35:55.254
I still wanted you
to be happy, though.

35:55.287 --> 35:57.923
Just not in front of me.

35:57.956 --> 35:59.425
I was.

36:01.427 --> 36:03.362
You know, happy, I mean.

36:03.395 --> 36:07.165
Yeah, I wish you still were.

36:07.199 --> 36:09.201
*

36:22.214 --> 36:24.216
(animal calling)

36:26.218 --> 36:29.821
Those handprints,
they have to be a sign.

36:29.855 --> 36:31.823
Yeah, but from what?

36:31.857 --> 36:33.825
Or who?

36:35.827 --> 36:37.663
(Tomas sighs)

36:37.696 --> 36:41.400
They're in my head, Marcus.
I don't want them there.

36:44.069 --> 36:46.137
I don't understand.

36:46.171 --> 36:47.639
Maybe you're not meant to.

36:49.675 --> 36:53.111
Do you think God led us here?

36:53.144 --> 36:55.814
If He did, He led you
'cause He's not talking to me.

36:55.847 --> 37:00.218
I haven't felt Him
for weeks now.

37:00.252 --> 37:01.853
Months.

37:01.887 --> 37:07.326
I can't remember a time
when He wasn't there.

37:07.359 --> 37:11.930
Even when the words are flowing
through me, I don't...

37:11.963 --> 37:13.899
feel His touch.

37:15.901 --> 37:18.069
Or hear His voice.

37:18.103 --> 37:20.806
Well, maybe you're
not listening.

37:20.839 --> 37:24.175
Tell you what, next time you
have a chat with the Creator,

37:24.209 --> 37:27.313
can you ask Him
where the hell He's been?

37:27.346 --> 37:29.548
Are you all right?

37:32.217 --> 37:34.119
I'm an empty pitcher.

37:36.121 --> 37:39.090
A pitcher like a...

37:39.124 --> 37:41.192
baseball pitcher?

37:41.226 --> 37:42.794
Water pitcher.

37:44.796 --> 37:46.398
His grace travels through me,

37:46.432 --> 37:48.400
becomes form, becomes word,
becomes power.

37:48.434 --> 37:50.702
That's how it's always been.

37:50.736 --> 37:52.371
Except lately.

37:52.404 --> 37:57.409
Now everything's rushing out
and nothing's coming back in.

37:57.443 --> 38:02.614
And the last of it leaves
when the words...

38:02.648 --> 38:04.282
run dry.

38:04.316 --> 38:08.987
If the words run dry,
I'll be there.

38:11.122 --> 38:13.459
We're partners.

38:13.492 --> 38:16.462
Maybe God...

38:16.495 --> 38:18.497
didn't send me a partner.

38:21.633 --> 38:24.470
Maybe he sent a replacement.

38:27.973 --> 38:30.208
(sighs) But there's work
to do here.

38:30.241 --> 38:33.612
There may be something
very wrong on this island.

38:36.782 --> 38:38.584
So, you trust me?

38:38.617 --> 38:41.987
You believe in God, Tomas.

38:42.020 --> 38:45.223
I believe in you.

38:45.256 --> 38:48.494
Apart from that?

38:48.527 --> 38:50.629
I ain't got the foggiest.

38:52.998 --> 38:55.000
(seabirds squawking)

38:58.604 --> 39:00.271
Andy?

39:00.305 --> 39:02.107
Yeah?

39:02.140 --> 39:05.010
If I go outside,
can I be your favorite?

39:05.043 --> 39:07.546
Grace.

39:07.579 --> 39:09.615
Please, Daddy?

39:09.648 --> 39:12.050
Please.

39:20.792 --> 39:22.794
I got you.

39:25.797 --> 39:28.199
You're doing great.

39:28.233 --> 39:31.236
Now... open your eyes.

39:36.241 --> 39:39.377
No more birds, I promise.

39:39.411 --> 39:40.812
No birds?

39:41.780 --> 39:43.582
No birds.

39:43.615 --> 39:45.951
I want to go down.

39:45.984 --> 39:47.886
You...

39:47.919 --> 39:50.522
Yeah. You got it.

39:50.556 --> 39:52.190
You got it.

40:03.435 --> 40:06.638
Andy?

40:06.672 --> 40:09.140
I feel like crap.

40:09.174 --> 40:11.342
For real this time.

40:11.376 --> 40:13.378
We got any soup?

40:17.449 --> 40:18.817
Andy?

40:18.850 --> 40:20.552

40:23.755 --> 40:26.424
Yeah, Grace! You did it!

40:26.458 --> 40:28.293

You did it.

40:45.210 --> 40:47.212

40:49.881 --> 40:51.883
Race you.

40:54.019 --> 40:56.054

All right.

41:04.129 --> 41:05.497
Good job.

41:05.531 --> 41:06.532
Yeah!

41:06.565 --> 41:08.567
(Andy laughs)

41:10.902 --> 41:14.205
And now I can swim
in the cove...

41:14.239 --> 41:16.908
-Yeah.
-...and stand on the old well

41:16.942 --> 41:18.910
that all the other kids
talk about.

41:18.944 --> 41:20.278
ANDY:
Okay, how about not that?

41:20.311 --> 41:21.947
(Grace chuckles)

41:21.980 --> 41:24.983
We can be together forever.

41:25.016 --> 41:28.086
Well, that sounds great.

41:28.119 --> 41:30.388
But first, got to take a nap.

41:30.421 --> 41:31.790
Got a big morning.

41:31.823 --> 41:34.660
-All right.
-All right.

41:37.663 --> 41:39.665

41:43.935 --> 41:45.937

41:48.073 --> 41:51.042
All right, shoes off.

41:54.012 --> 41:57.015
One... two.

42:01.753 --> 42:03.955
Hey.

42:03.989 --> 42:05.991
