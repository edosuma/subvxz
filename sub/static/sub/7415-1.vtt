Semper fi.

02:44.208 --> 02:49.280
Excuse me, sir, but could you spare
a few dollars for a cup of coffee?

02:49.380 --> 02:52.324
We're marines, not tourists.
Now bug off.

02:52.424 --> 02:55.577
Marines earn a lot of money.
Give me a dollar.

02:55.677 --> 03:00.045
- What is it, a shake-down?
- Let's get outta here. Excuse us.

03:02.393 --> 03:04.173
Shit, man.

04:06.912 --> 04:09.774
You did good, Tommy.

04:09.874 --> 04:12.865

06:26.504 --> 06:28.740
- No.
- Shit.

06:28.840 --> 06:32.786
We're supposed to pick up
two marines on this flight.

06:32.886 --> 06:36.414
Armstrong and Jackson.

are supposed to be marines.

Sorry.

Well, throw your stuff in the back
and jump in.

06:52.446 --> 06:55.484
Army. What a drag.

Anyway, I'm Charlie

Welcome to paradise. Let's go.

07:16.344 --> 07:18.955
So, where'd you guys get this ride?

07:19.055 --> 07:22.125
- Borrowed it from Wild Bill.
- Wild who?

07:22.225 --> 07:26.129
- Our CO.
- Your CO.

07:26.229 --> 07:31.718
Their commanding officer is Wild Bill.
That makes you feel safe, doesn't it?

07:31.818 --> 07:34.387
I know I'm not going to like it here.

07:34.487 --> 07:38.182
Doesn't Wild Bill mind
that you're using his wheels?

07:38.282 --> 07:41.017
He doesn't exactly know about it.

07:41.117 --> 07:44.354
Doesn't exactly know about it.

07:44.454 --> 07:48.901
Listen, fellas,
I'm not one to stick to tradition,

07:49.001 --> 07:51.277
but isn't this a bit unorthodox?

07:51.377 --> 07:54.448
Bud, you haven't seen
the half of it yet.

07:54.548 --> 07:57.534
JACKSON: Oh, yes, I have. Look at that.

07:57.634 --> 08:00.541
Huh-ho, I'm tingling again.

hit the beach, everything comes off.

- Work?
- Yeah, work.

08:17.111 --> 08:19.900
We don't have time for work.

08:23.701 --> 08:27.320
I think I'm gonna like it here.

08:37.255 --> 08:40.660
- It ain't much, but it's home.
- JACKSON: Yeah.

08:46.514 --> 08:49.083
Glad he feels comfortable around us.

08:49.183 --> 08:51.503
Tommy's just had problems lately.

- Hi, Toto. Guys, this is Toto.

09:13.749 --> 09:18.153
Anything you want, Toto'll get it for you.
For a price, that is.

09:18.253 --> 09:22.114
- For a price, huh?
- I'll do errands, clean your car.

09:22.214 --> 09:25.205
Anything you want. Very cheap.

09:26.385 --> 09:30.122
Hey, hey. Am I seeing things

09:30.222 --> 09:33.292
or is this a couple of soldier boys
we got round here?

09:33.392 --> 09:36.798
Rangers, my son. Rangers.

09:37.897 --> 09:39.840
Rangers, huh?

09:39.940 --> 09:41.887
Yeah.

09:43.277 --> 09:47.608
What the hell
those bums doing round here?

Sergeant Joe Armstrong, sir.

09:59.584 --> 10:01.743
Front and centre!

10:05.798 --> 10:07.222
So...

10:09.135 --> 10:11.079
You two are rangers, huh?

10:11.179 --> 10:15.124
Don't Washington know marines
guard embassies, not rangers?

10:15.224 --> 10:18.502
As if my life wasn't
complicated enough already.

10:18.602 --> 10:23.006
- Do you know why you're here?
- We were told you would brief us.

10:23.106 --> 10:27.887
Yeah. There are 20 marines stationed
on the island as embassy guards.

10:27.987 --> 10:30.889
We dress as little
like marines as possible.

10:30.989 --> 10:34.435
Left-wing elements
stir up trouble against us.

10:34.535 --> 10:37.187
Four of my men have disappeared,

10:37.287 --> 10:39.940
two on a fishing trip, two in town.

10:40.040 --> 10:44.861
A marine said one minute he was talking
to them, the next they were gone.

10:44.961 --> 10:48.782
Sounds crazy, but there's a kid
that hangs round the barracks

10:48.882 --> 10:53.328
who said he saw two giants
dressed in strange black suits

10:53.428 --> 10:56.246
taking the men away in a motor launch.

10:56.346 --> 10:58.916
We thought they'd been kidnapped,

10:59.016 --> 11:02.419
but there's been no ransom demands
and no bodies.

11:02.519 --> 11:04.463
It's a goddamn mystery.

11:04.563 --> 11:09.343
So I made my report to Washington
asking for help and they sent you.

11:09.443 --> 11:12.470
All I have to go on
is what the kid told me.

11:12.570 --> 11:15.849
Who was it that last
saw the marines, sir?

11:15.949 --> 11:21.021
Name's Taylor. Kind of a strange guy.
Married a local girl a year ago.

11:21.121 --> 11:25.400
- WILD BILL: He's been going downhill since.
- We've got the picture.

11:25.500 --> 11:28.694
I don't know who you are
or why you're here,

11:28.794 --> 11:31.072
but I've been told to help you.

11:31.172 --> 11:33.616
So you work in the embassy,

11:33.716 --> 11:37.328
keep a low profile
and don't mess with my marines.

11:37.428 --> 11:39.256
We'll do our best, sir.

11:39.930 --> 11:42.506
Now get outta here.

11:49.815 --> 11:54.970
Men in black suits.
Sounds familiar, doesn't it?

11:55.070 --> 11:58.393
- Yeah.
- I'll show you your rooms.

water-skiing later.

12:06.581 --> 12:09.442
You're welcome to come along
if you want.

12:09.542 --> 12:12.449
- Water-skiing?
- Yeah. Why not?

12:15.089 --> 12:16.699
Thank you, Toto.

12:16.799 --> 12:22.037
- JACKSON: Look at that babe.
- CHARLIE: Jackson, Joe. Hey.

12:22.137 --> 12:24.707
How you doing? You know Toto, right?

12:24.807 --> 12:28.085
- Hi.
- This right here is Bert Ballard.

but his sister is so fine.

Let's go to Mangrove Island.
Wall-to-wall babes. They're all dying for it.

13:14.271 --> 13:17.174
- Last I heard you were married.
- So?

13:17.274 --> 13:22.095
TOM: Just 'cause I'm on a diet
doesn't mean I can't look at the menu.

13:22.195 --> 13:24.936
Good point. Very good point. Get it.

14:00.774 --> 14:03.349
Looks like we got a problem.

14:06.028 --> 14:09.185
- Put her up there on the beach.
- Yeah, OK.

14:14.078 --> 14:17.022
You OK, Taylor?

14:17.122 --> 14:18.902
Yeah, sure.

14:20.459 --> 14:23.738
I don't wanna swim
all the way back to the base.

14:23.838 --> 14:26.495
TOM: It's probably the carburettor.

14:29.259 --> 14:31.870
BERT: Let's push it in.

14:31.970 --> 14:37.429
That's it. Let me check the engine.
Get it in there.

14:41.354 --> 14:44.591
Well, let's check the engine.

14:44.691 --> 14:46.850
All right.

The US Marines strike again.

14:54.659 --> 14:58.563
Doesn't seem to be anything wrong,
not that I can see.

15:03.876 --> 15:06.321
Everything seems to be all right.

15:09.631 --> 15:11.867
Screw it. Let's go for a swim.

15:11.967 --> 15:15.120
Yeah. Come on.

trying to kidnap us, sir.

What would these guys
be grabbing you morons for?

22:36.352 --> 22:40.798

Escort these three men outside.

I'll have you shot, you understand?

by these same ninja?

- Yes, sir.
- But why?

23:04.296 --> 23:07.948
- Are they working for the Russians?
- We don't know.

23:08.048 --> 23:12.036
Shit. I guess
I'll have to alert the ambassador.

23:12.136 --> 23:16.540
If you give us a few more days,
we can come up with something.

but I don't like it.

were over at Mangrove Island

23:37.577 --> 23:41.022
taking care of the local talent, right?

23:41.122 --> 23:44.150
You may have got away
with that in the army,

23:44.250 --> 23:48.913
but you sure as hell
ain't gonna get away with it here.

29:31.917 --> 29:35.904
- Who's the Lion?
- The man who owns Blackbeard Island.

29:36.004 --> 29:39.116
- Tell me more about him.
- I can't.

29:39.216 --> 29:41.244
- Tell me!
- I can't!

29:42.302 --> 29:45.455
Look, I'm the only one
that can help you,

29:45.555 --> 29:47.715
the only one.

29:48.766 --> 29:51.336
He's a millionaire.

29:51.436 --> 29:56.132
He made his money big time in drugs.
He's doing research.

29:56.232 --> 30:01.762
- What kind of research?
- I don't know. They don't tell me.

30:01.862 --> 30:04.431
- It's biological stuff.
- (TAPPING)

30:04.531 --> 30:09.985
Did you hear that? Someone's there, man.
I hear somebody.

30:33.143 --> 30:39.673
(SIGHS) I'm sorry to inform you of this,
but I have some bad news.

30:39.773 --> 30:43.060
Taylor's been killed.
I think you knew him.

30:43.569 --> 30:48.808
- Yes, sir. Any idea who did it, sir?
- Not yet, but we shall find them.

30:48.908 --> 30:54.355
The inspector thinks he was involved
in the local drug trade.

30:54.455 --> 30:58.733
- We think Taylor was being blackmailed.
- How do you know?

30:58.833 --> 31:02.821
- He told me.
- His wife was taken to Blackbeard Island.

31:02.921 --> 31:05.657
He was probably afraid she'd be killed.

31:05.757 --> 31:09.826
Rubbish. Blackbeard Island
is owned by Professor Sanborn.

31:09.927 --> 31:13.081
Why should he blackmail
a nobody like Taylor?

31:13.181 --> 31:17.250
It's a good question.
Why don't we go take a look?

31:17.351 --> 31:22.006
Impossible. Professor Sanborn
is a man of impeccable character.

31:22.106 --> 31:26.510
I would require a warrant
from the governor to search the place,

31:26.610 --> 31:30.014
and he would be outraged
at such a suggestion.

31:30.114 --> 31:33.982
- Would he?
- He certainly would, Captain.

31:34.743 --> 31:37.729
Please remember
you people are guests here.

31:37.829 --> 31:42.526
You can't go about trespassing
on other people's property.

31:42.626 --> 31:45.570
For the sake of your good name, Captain,

31:45.670 --> 31:51.793
I hope that no more of your young men
are involved in this sordid business.

31:59.726 --> 32:02.670
I don't like that tiny maggot at all.

32:02.770 --> 32:07.008
Ninjas, drug-pushers,
my men being kidnapped and murdered.

32:07.108 --> 32:10.228
This is really beginning
to get on my tits.

32:11.362 --> 32:15.599
There's a reception tomorrow
at the governor's mansion.

32:15.699 --> 32:20.479
A token party is required to attend.
I would like you men there.

32:20.579 --> 32:26.443
To avoid any other complications,
I want you dressed as marines.

32:26.543 --> 32:27.986
Marines?

32:28.086 --> 32:31.290
(UPBEAT BAND MUSIC)

33:14.422 --> 33:18.326
You look as much like a marine
as a bridesmaid.

33:18.426 --> 33:20.953
Let's go.

33:21.053 --> 33:23.581
Look, be careful with the uniform.

33:23.681 --> 33:26.250
It's the only one I got.

33:26.350 --> 33:28.336
Marines.

33:28.436 --> 33:30.595
I'll just wait here.

33:32.398 --> 33:36.136
I'll park the car. Yeah.

33:38.362 --> 33:41.098
- Captain Woodward.
- Hello, Governor.

33:41.198 --> 33:46.560
So glad that you could come. These men
are a credit to you, Ambassador.

33:46.661 --> 33:50.273
- You do know my wife, I believe?
- Yes, I do, sir.

33:50.373 --> 33:53.026
- How are you?
- Very well, my dear.

33:53.126 --> 33:56.654
Jolly good. Enjoy yourselves.

33:56.754 --> 33:59.240
Excuse us.

33:59.340 --> 34:04.203
- I don't think I've met these men.
- They're on a special assignment.

34:04.303 --> 34:08.290
Really? Can I have a word
about the reception next week?

34:08.389 --> 34:11.001
Yes, you may.

34:11.101 --> 34:14.964
Don't stand there
staring at the guests. Mingle.

34:15.063 --> 34:19.311
And you, don't get drunk
and go puking on the pavements.

34:26.116 --> 34:28.685
Excuse me, ma'am. Wow.

34:28.784 --> 34:33.063
Did you know that eating this
is very bad for your health?

34:33.164 --> 34:35.567
Really? So what do you suggest?

34:35.667 --> 34:40.612
Well, isometrics, aerobics.

34:40.713 --> 34:42.577
And me...

and exercise that you can never imagine.

34:55.518 --> 35:00.132
Believe me. I am telling you the truth.

35:00.232 --> 35:02.384
- What?
- Guy with the scar.

35:02.484 --> 35:05.059
I've seen him before.

35:06.863 --> 35:10.058
It looks like he's seen you
before, too, pal.

35:10.158 --> 35:12.947
Well, you know how to deal with it.

35:14.412 --> 35:18.566
Excuse me. Those two gentlemen
over there, who are they?

35:18.666 --> 35:21.235
- Welcome to the party, Leo.
- Hello.

35:21.335 --> 35:23.780
Ah, friends of the governor, sir.

35:23.880 --> 35:26.207
The man with the glasses is Leo Burke.

35:26.307 --> 35:29.910
The one with the scar
is Tojo Ken, his assistant.

35:30.010 --> 35:32.170
Thanks.

35:33.347 --> 35:35.916
- That's him.
- That's who?

35:36.016 --> 35:39.211
The guy that Taylor told me about.

35:39.311 --> 35:41.546
- Leo Burke.
- Lion.

35:41.646 --> 35:47.135
Yeah. Friends of the governor, too.
This is getting very interesting.

35:47.235 --> 35:51.681
Armstrong, Inspector Singh
has something to say to you.

35:51.781 --> 35:54.351
I have informed your commanding officer

35:54.451 --> 35:57.604
that just before Marine Taylor
was killed

35:57.704 --> 36:01.440
you were seen by several witnesses
going into his room.

36:01.540 --> 36:04.402
Accompany me to the police station

36:04.502 --> 36:06.994
to answer several serious questions.

36:11.342 --> 36:14.161
Bastard! Bastard!

- Keep an eye on him. I'll be back.

36:22.353 --> 36:25.557
I tell you now, I'd love to kill you!

36:27.524 --> 36:30.928
- This man is a drug dealer.
- You are mistaken.

36:31.028 --> 36:34.472
- Careful. She's not well.
- I'm perfectly well.

36:34.572 --> 36:39.394
- This man is a criminal. Arrest him.
- Remove her.

36:39.494 --> 36:43.898
He's a criminal.
He took my father prisoner. Please help!

let a lady down yet.

- Yes, sir. We should kick some ass.
- Take my car.

Yes, sir.

ARMSTRONG: So what about the Lion?

55:22.947 --> 55:26.808
One of the most powerful
drug dealers in the world.

55:26.908 --> 55:29.645
- Everybody knows it.
- And your father?

55:29.745 --> 55:35.066
My mother died of cancer,
and my father's a scientist.

55:35.166 --> 55:39.821
After she died, he clung to this dream.
He was going to find a cure for cancer.

55:39.921 --> 55:44.826
He sold everything, bought the island
and set up a research laboratory.

55:44.926 --> 55:49.748
He worked hard. The British and American
governments invested money.

55:49.848 --> 55:56.171
Everything was going so well. Dad was
on the verge of a big breakthrough and...

55:57.730 --> 56:02.477
Well, they simply withdrew.
Dad was devastated.

56:03.694 --> 56:06.898
I was away at school at that time.

56:08.365 --> 56:10.524
When Dad called me...

56:13.870 --> 56:16.148
Anyway, then the Lion turned up

56:16.248 --> 56:20.903
and he offered Dad money, lots,
enough to finish his project.

56:21.003 --> 56:24.280
Dad jumped at the chance,
didn't ask questions.

56:24.380 --> 56:27.704
He was so close to finding his cure.

56:29.051 --> 56:33.914
The Lion had other ideas,
and instead of finding his cure for cancer,

56:34.014 --> 56:39.044
Dad ended up producing
these attacking monsters, these ninjas.

56:39.144 --> 56:40.713
Producing?

56:40.813 --> 56:43.841
Something to do with
biological engineering.

56:43.941 --> 56:46.885
Reorganising a person's genetic code.

56:46.985 --> 56:50.138
They used those marines
for their experiments.

56:50.238 --> 56:54.476
And you? Where do you fit into all this?

56:54.576 --> 56:58.856
Bait. As long as they've got me,
they can blackmail my father.

56:58.956 --> 57:02.650
If they harm me,
he'll stop working for them.

57:02.750 --> 57:08.031
They won't let me near him, though,
in case I try to influence him.

57:12.593 --> 57:19.131
I guess we'd better see what we can
do about it, huh? Come on, let's go.

57:22.978 --> 57:28.717
The ambassador won't give us permission
to go in until he hears from Washington.

57:28.817 --> 57:32.429
That'll take another year.
What are we going to do?

57:32.529 --> 57:36.392
Apparently, the governor
won't let us visit the island.

57:36.492 --> 57:39.060
WILD BILL:
We got a tricky political situation.

57:39.160 --> 57:41.396
We got political red tape, Captain.

57:41.496 --> 57:45.441
You heard Toto.
Joe and Alicia are stuck in that island.

57:45.541 --> 57:49.070
They'll have to improvise
till we get the go-ahead.

57:49.170 --> 57:52.375
I'm sorry, but that's not good enough.

57:59.388 --> 58:03.375
Years ago, we started out
on the streets,

58:03.476 --> 58:06.003
low-down and dirty.

58:06.103 --> 58:07.922
We soon realised

58:08.022 --> 58:13.760
to have it all, to really nail it down,
we had to control the source.

58:13.860 --> 58:16.930
So we moved out into the jungles.

58:17.030 --> 58:20.099
We took over the plantations
and factories,

58:20.199 --> 58:26.189
until we built the biggest drug empire
the world has ever known.

58:26.289 --> 58:29.651
But success brings jealousy,

58:29.751 --> 58:32.320
and we laid out millions with pay-offs,

58:32.420 --> 58:35.321
but the greed only grew.

58:35.423 --> 58:40.370
So you came to me and you asked me
to find a foolproof way

58:40.470 --> 58:43.330
to protect ourselves and our investment.

58:43.430 --> 58:47.959
So, with the help
of Professor Sanborn here,

58:48.059 --> 58:53.221
I think I've achieved that objective.

58:58.278 --> 59:01.139
So there you are,

59:01.239 --> 59:03.391
the super ninja,

59:03.491 --> 59:06.477
the ultimate fighting machine.

59:06.577 --> 59:09.939
Strong, obedient,

59:10.039 --> 59:12.317
heartless,

59:12.417 --> 59:15.952
and as many of them as we want.

59:17.796 --> 59:22.378
Enjoy yourselves now,
and let's see what they can do.

01:00:27.238 --> 01:00:29.766
It's this way. Come on.

01:01:00.562 --> 01:01:03.220
This is it.

01:01:13.324 --> 01:01:15.893
Where do they make these things?

01:01:15.993 --> 01:01:20.272
At the far end of the complex.
It's on the third floor.

01:02:15.800 --> 01:02:17.961
(WHISPERS) Wait here.

01:03:21.406 --> 01:03:24.195
NINJA: Ssh.

01:05:31.905 --> 01:05:34.564
What's the matter?

01:05:50.715 --> 01:05:54.577
How d'you make them, Leo? What are they?

01:05:54.677 --> 01:05:57.585
Miracles of genetic engineering.

01:05:59.683 --> 01:06:04.298
Professor Sanborn
will show us how it's done.

01:06:05.521 --> 01:06:07.680
Right, Professor?

01:06:16.824 --> 01:06:20.893
If we wait for the ambassador,
it's gonna be too late.

01:06:20.995 --> 01:06:24.189
- Watch your mouth.
- Chill out, motor mouth.

01:06:24.289 --> 01:06:29.027
This unit's lost five marines.
Do you wanna lose Joe and the girl?

01:06:29.127 --> 01:06:33.908
No, I thought not. I'm boogieing, baby.
Anyone coming with me?

01:06:49.480 --> 01:06:51.640
ALICIA: This is it.

01:07:04.536 --> 01:07:07.408
(GASPS) It's my father.

01:07:10.375 --> 01:07:12.369
He looks sick.

01:07:27.267 --> 01:07:30.719
Gentlemen, this is it.

01:07:33.773 --> 01:07:37.261
Professor, we're all ears.

01:07:41.113 --> 01:07:44.224
These flasks contain frozen cells

01:07:44.324 --> 01:07:46.899
in a solution of amino acids.

01:07:48.078 --> 01:07:50.980
What are those men doing?

01:07:51.080 --> 01:07:56.236
Microinjecting DNA hereditary information
into a single cell.

01:07:56.336 --> 01:08:00.406
By this method, we can control
the building blocks of life.

01:08:00.506 --> 01:08:03.576
We can make the human being
anything we want it to be.

01:08:03.676 --> 01:08:07.914
He keeps most of what's left
of his human intelligence,

01:08:08.014 --> 01:08:12.043
but his knowledge of attack and survival

01:08:12.143 --> 01:08:18.465
He will be cunning, intelligent
and devious, like a predatory tiger.

01:08:18.564 --> 01:08:24.023
He will feel no pain
and know no emotion but hate.

01:08:26.323 --> 01:08:28.725
His muscles and sinews will be replaced

01:08:28.825 --> 01:08:36.314
with the strongest, lightest,
high-tensile steel known to man.

01:08:36.415 --> 01:08:40.528
He will run faster
than the finest Olympic athlete,

01:08:40.627 --> 01:08:44.740
be stronger than a ten-ton crane.

01:08:44.840 --> 01:08:48.787
And in this next generation,

01:08:48.886 --> 01:08:53.749
you will witness the most lethal assassin
the world has ever known.

01:08:53.849 --> 01:08:56.335
And the best part,

01:08:56.435 --> 01:09:00.600
he will follow
my every order to the letter.

01:09:01.939 --> 01:09:04.100
Right, Professor?

01:09:06.069 --> 01:09:10.352
I think the professor needs his vitamins.
Take him away.

01:09:17.080 --> 01:09:20.984
And now, gentlemen, for another treat.

01:09:22.542 --> 01:09:24.988
I'm going to show you something

01:09:25.087 --> 01:09:29.287
that you never dreamed possible.

01:09:58.870 --> 01:10:00.032
Dad.

01:10:03.374 --> 01:10:06.653
Alicia. I thought I'd lost you for ever.

01:10:06.753 --> 01:10:09.906
- It's all right.
- There is no time to lose.

01:10:10.006 --> 01:10:15.245
The Lion is shipping five billion dollars'
worth of heroin to the US tomorrow.

01:10:15.345 --> 01:10:18.539
If that gets through,
nothing will stop him.

01:10:18.639 --> 01:10:21.959
- Where are the marines?
- In the basement. Cell block A.

01:10:22.059 --> 01:10:28.182
Alicia, take your father to the boat.
If I'm not back in an hour, leave. Go.

01:10:42.037 --> 01:10:46.486
These symbols will focus
the ultimate power of purpose.

01:10:47.500 --> 01:10:48.663
Zai.

01:10:52.922 --> 01:10:56.492
You were just a baby
when I first found you.

01:10:56.592 --> 01:10:59.787
I conditioned your body and your senses.

01:10:59.887 --> 01:11:03.123
I only teach you what you need to know,

01:11:03.223 --> 01:11:08.253
so when the time comes, you can
take your place on the field of honour

01:11:08.353 --> 01:11:10.301
and meet your destiny.

01:11:10.438 --> 01:11:11.965
Zen.

01:11:12.065 --> 01:11:14.176
Kobudera.

01:11:14.276 --> 01:11:16.052
Kobudera.

01:11:16.152 --> 01:11:17.887
Ninja magic.

01:11:17.987 --> 01:11:19.473
Intonjutsu.

01:11:19.573 --> 01:11:21.725
The ability to seem invisible,

01:11:21.825 --> 01:11:25.230
cause fear and paralysis
in your enemies.

01:11:26.162 --> 01:11:28.732
You are ready, my son.

01:11:28.832 --> 01:11:33.569
I will be with you in deed and in my heart.
Follow the bushido.

01:11:33.669 --> 01:11:36.245
ARMSTRONG:
I will honour the code, Father.

01:12:01.321 --> 01:12:05.558
OK, ladies. The main objective
is to get everybody out alive.

01:12:05.658 --> 01:12:08.227
No shooting unless we're shot at.

01:12:08.327 --> 01:12:11.899
You know what to do. Let's move out.

01:12:15.834 --> 01:12:18.624
WILD BILL: Come on, move it out.

01:13:03.547 --> 01:13:04.990
MAN: Stevens.

01:13:05.090 --> 01:13:07.333
What?

01:13:08.802 --> 01:13:13.665
Hi, guys. I'm Joe Armstrong.
Wild Bill sent me to take you home.

01:13:13.765 --> 01:13:16.293
- Let's go.
- Wild Bill?

01:13:16.393 --> 01:13:19.004
- All right!
- Come on.

01:13:21.314 --> 01:13:24.518
- ARMSTRONG: Where does this door lead to?
- MAN: The arena.

01:13:31.449 --> 01:13:34.185
(THEY WHISPER INDISTINCTLY)

01:13:34.285 --> 01:13:36.647
MAN: I can't see.

01:13:42.335 --> 01:13:45.737
BURKE: American ninja, I presume.

01:13:45.837 --> 01:13:48.626
How very nice to meet you.

01:13:55.680 --> 01:13:59.709
- Your days are over, Burke.
- On the contrary.

01:13:59.809 --> 01:14:03.130
I'm expecting
an even more prosperous future,

01:14:03.230 --> 01:14:07.299
and parts of you
will be a part of that future.

01:14:07.400 --> 01:14:09.559
Take 'im to the lab.

01:14:59.158 --> 01:15:01.105
OK, men. Let's move out.

01:15:12.254 --> 01:15:16.288
- The man isn't human, Leo.
- What do you think they are?

01:15:43.701 --> 01:15:46.645
I never would have believed it.

01:15:46.745 --> 01:15:49.648
- I told you so.
- Farlie, make 'em dance.

01:15:49.748 --> 01:15:52.904
- Yes, sir.
- WILD BILL: Let's do it!

01:15:53.669 --> 01:15:56.825
- What was that?
- How the hell do I know?

01:16:13.187 --> 01:16:15.264
Hit it!

01:16:26.742 --> 01:16:30.771
Finish off that son of a bitch
once and for all.

01:16:30.871 --> 01:16:33.441
The rest of you, come with me.

01:16:33.541 --> 01:16:36.863
(MACHINE-GUN FIRE IN DISTANCE)

01:16:46.511 --> 01:16:49.705
- There's something I must do.
- I'll come with you.

01:16:49.805 --> 01:16:52.792
No, no, I must do this alone.

01:16:52.892 --> 01:16:55.051
I love you.

01:17:15.038 --> 01:17:17.613
MAN: Hold back!

01:17:20.418 --> 01:17:22.612
MAN: Hold it!

01:17:22.712 --> 01:17:25.583
Merry Christmas.

01:17:27.967 --> 01:17:30.413
All right, it's a party. Let's go!

01:17:45.943 --> 01:17:48.103
Shit.

01:17:50.031 --> 01:17:53.436
- What do we do now, Leo?
- Kiss my ass.

01:17:55.243 --> 01:17:58.272
Thank God.
The Lion was going to kill me.

01:17:58.372 --> 01:18:01.608
Yeah, right. Take him.

01:18:01.708 --> 01:18:04.948
I'll see if I can find Mr Burke for you.

01:18:05.878 --> 01:18:07.956
Catch that little weasel.

01:18:10.884 --> 01:18:13.542
Let's move out.

01:18:31.820 --> 01:18:35.025
What's going on?
What the hell are you doing?

01:18:36.074 --> 01:18:39.602
I was hoping we could create
a better world, Leo,

01:18:39.702 --> 01:18:43.190
where cripples could walk
and the blind could see,

01:18:43.290 --> 01:18:47.110
and criminal vermin
could be made into useful citizens.

01:18:47.210 --> 01:18:50.155
- But you corrupted me.
- You understood.

01:18:50.255 --> 01:18:53.533
You understood
what we were trying to create.

01:18:53.633 --> 01:18:58.121
Create? You destroyed
everything that I dreamed of.

01:18:58.221 --> 01:19:01.457
Now I'm going to destroy your dreams.

01:19:01.557 --> 01:19:03.136
Damn you!

01:21:12.724 --> 01:21:14.504
Stay down!

01:23:41.784 --> 01:23:43.943
MAN: Man, am I glad to see you!

01:24:06.141 --> 01:24:10.508
Could I have everyone's attention?
Jackson, Armstrong.

01:24:12.230 --> 01:24:15.850
I must admit,
for army you're not half bad.

01:24:17.986 --> 01:24:22.306
But if you wanna join the marines,
I can pull some strings.

01:24:22.406 --> 01:24:24.642
I don't know about Jackson, sir,

01:24:24.742 --> 01:24:28.563
but I think I've got other plans.

01:24:28.663 --> 01:24:31.356
So do I, Colonel.

01:24:32.333 --> 01:24:35.406
If you're round this way again,
look us up.

01:24:37.505 --> 01:24:40.198
- Sir.
- Good luck, Armstrong.

01:24:41.342 --> 01:24:43.285
Right on.

01:24:43.385 --> 01:24:46.589
- I'll write to you.
- No, you won't.

01:24:47.806 --> 01:24:51.251
- I'll call you.
- No, you won't.

01:24:51.351 --> 01:24:54.507
Right. Just remember me.

01:24:56.982 --> 01:24:59.968
- Look after yourself.
- Thank you.

01:25:00.068 --> 01:25:04.315
You guys'd better hurry
if you wanna catch that plane.

01:25:05.740 --> 01:25:07.934
- Let's go.
- OK.

01:25:08.034 --> 01:25:11.238
- Thank you, sir.
- Good luck, Armstrong.

01:25:12.204 --> 01:25:16.400
MEN: See you, guys. So long. Good luck.

01:25:16.500 --> 01:25:18.660
MAN: Take it easy.

01:25:19.837 --> 01:25:21.996
Joe, come on.

01:25:25.384 --> 01:25:30.413
Joe, I don't really do credit.
You owe me five bucks.

01:25:30.513 --> 01:25:33.041
At the beach? "I'll pay you later."

01:25:33.141 --> 01:25:35.716
You owe me five bucks.

01:25:37.604 --> 01:25:40.090
Oh, yeah.

01:25:40.190 --> 01:25:44.639
I almost forgot. Here. Open it.

01:25:53.243 --> 01:25:56.814
- Is it for me?
- Yeah, it's for you.

01:25:56.914 --> 01:25:59.400
- All right.
- You like it?

01:25:59.500 --> 01:26:02.193
- Yeah.
- OK. Let's go.
