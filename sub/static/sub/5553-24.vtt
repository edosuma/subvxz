WEBVTT

00:03.456 --> 00:04.356
Hey.

00:04.357 --> 00:05.923
Hi, how was the screening?

00:05.925 --> 00:07.725
Oh, Sheldon invoked Rosa Parks

00:07.727 --> 00:10.227
to make somebody who
cut the line feel bad,

00:10.229 --> 00:14.632
but only the
white people felt bad.

00:14.634 --> 00:16.834
Ugh, I should've never bought
him that coloring book

00:16.836 --> 00:19.603
that explains
Black History Month.

00:19.605 --> 00:21.038
How'd it go with my mother?

00:21.040 --> 00:23.073
Uh, you know,
it started a little rocky,

00:23.075 --> 00:24.975
but I think we got
to a good place.

00:24.977 --> 00:26.010
Wow.

00:26.012 --> 00:27.278
Well done.
(chuckles)

00:27.280 --> 00:28.479
Yeah, and when I dropped her off
at the hotel,

00:28.481 --> 00:29.480
she even gave me a hug.

00:29.482 --> 00:32.983
Did she think
you were choking or...

00:32.985 --> 00:34.418
I'm sorry, that's great.

00:34.420 --> 00:36.153
Thank you for
spending time with her.

00:36.155 --> 00:37.621
No problem.

00:37.623 --> 00:39.089
Um, so listen,

00:39.091 --> 00:41.892
I don't know if you have
any plans next weekend,

00:41.894 --> 00:43.694
but I kind of promised your mom

00:43.696 --> 00:45.195
we'd have another
wedding ceremony

00:45.197 --> 00:47.298
so she could attend this time.

00:47.300 --> 00:50.367
Wait, we're gonna
get married again?

00:50.369 --> 00:53.471
Yeah, kind of, but now we can
invite our friends and family.

00:53.472 --> 00:56.173
Seems like a lot
of trouble for a hug.

00:56.174 --> 00:57.373
Come on, it'll be fun,

00:57.375 --> 00:59.008
and, you know, your mom
was genuinely hurt

00:59.010 --> 01:00.676
we didn't invite her
to the first one.

01:00.678 --> 01:02.077
Look, in our defense,

01:02.079 --> 01:04.245
it was kind of a spur
of the moment thing,

01:04.248 --> 01:06.382
and also, we don't like her.

01:06.384 --> 01:07.950
Leonard, come on,
she's your mom.

01:07.952 --> 01:09.985
If we can do something
to make her happy,

01:09.987 --> 01:10.886
why wouldn't we?

01:10.888 --> 01:12.154
I just said why--

01:12.156 --> 01:13.889
we don't like her.

01:13.891 --> 01:15.191
Hey, look,
then forget about her,

01:15.193 --> 01:16.358
let's do it for us.

01:16.360 --> 01:17.693
We could keep it
small and informal.

01:17.695 --> 01:19.161
This time we can
invite our families.

01:19.163 --> 01:20.496
Is your brother out of prison?

01:20.498 --> 01:22.665
Thanks to overcrowding, yeah.

01:22.667 --> 01:25.768
I'd love it
if my dad could come.

01:25.770 --> 01:27.136
Oh, you have to invite him.

01:27.138 --> 01:28.604
I haven't seen him
since the divorce.

01:28.606 --> 01:30.506
Oh, he's like a different man.

01:30.508 --> 01:32.107
Oh.
He stopped twitching,

01:32.109 --> 01:34.577
and I think he grew
an inch and a half.

01:34.579 --> 01:36.478
Well, then it's settled.

01:36.480 --> 01:37.813
Yay.

01:37.815 --> 01:38.814
God.

01:38.816 --> 01:39.982
So funny.

01:39.984 --> 01:42.418
I never thought my second
marriage would be to you!

02:13.534 --> 02:15.200
Okay, so it's not
a legal ceremony,

02:15.202 --> 02:16.368
it's just a chance for us

02:16.370 --> 02:18.970
to redo our vows
so everyone can be part of it.

02:18.972 --> 02:22.474
So there's no maid of honor?

02:22.476 --> 02:23.408
No.

02:23.410 --> 02:26.578
Huh.

02:26.580 --> 02:29.881
But if I were to, say,
wear a purple satin dress

02:29.883 --> 02:32.217
with a sweetheart neckline
and stand near you,

02:32.219 --> 02:34.653
you wouldn't be able
to stop me, right?

02:36.190 --> 02:37.656
I don't see how I could.

02:37.658 --> 02:38.657
(chuckles)

02:38.659 --> 02:41.493
Then I graciously accept.

02:41.495 --> 02:42.994
Who's going to officiate?

02:42.996 --> 02:44.696
I was kind of hoping you would.

02:44.698 --> 02:47.599
Wait, now I'm just some
lousy maid of honor?

02:49.002 --> 02:51.269
Hey, good news, I just got off
the phone with my mother.

02:51.271 --> 02:52.337
She is coming to the wedding.

02:52.339 --> 02:54.072
Okay, wait,

02:54.074 --> 02:55.841
you're inviting people
to <i>our</i> wedding?

02:55.843 --> 02:59.745
Yes, I'm inviting
people to <i>our</i> wedding.

02:59.747 --> 03:01.012
Yeah, I've already asked

03:01.014 --> 03:03.382
Stephen Hawking
and Robert Downey Jr.

03:03.384 --> 03:04.983
And now, don't get your hopes
up, 'cause he's pretty busy,

03:04.985 --> 03:07.352
but Erno Rubik.

03:07.354 --> 03:09.354
Who's Erno Rubik?

03:09.356 --> 03:11.857
Seriously?

03:11.859 --> 03:13.325
He invented the Rubik's Cube.

03:13.327 --> 03:15.460
Okay, fine,

03:15.462 --> 03:17.129
but why would you invite him
to our wedding?

03:17.131 --> 03:19.431
Because, despite his fame
and fortune,

03:19.433 --> 03:21.933
he strikes me as a lonely man.

03:21.935 --> 03:24.136
Well, it's very sweet

03:24.138 --> 03:26.338
of you to go to all this trouble
for Leonard's mother.

03:26.340 --> 03:27.939
Yeah, I'm also doing it
for Leonard.

03:27.941 --> 03:29.975
I think this could really help
their relationship.

03:29.977 --> 03:33.145
How dare you invite your father
without consulting me!

03:35.849 --> 03:38.150
Sorry, but I don't think
I need your permission

03:38.152 --> 03:40.285
to have my father at my wedding.

03:40.287 --> 03:42.821
You do understand our marriage
ended because he had an affair.

03:42.823 --> 03:43.889
I know,

03:43.891 --> 03:45.957
and there's no excuse for that.

03:45.959 --> 03:49.528
He claimed I was cold,
emasculating,

03:49.530 --> 03:52.364
and hadn't shown him any
physical affection for years.

03:52.366 --> 03:55.867
I was wrong, there's
three excuses for that.

03:57.000 --> 04:03.074

04:06.513 --> 04:08.547
Oh, my God.

04:08.549 --> 04:09.481
It's working.

04:09.483 --> 04:11.049
You sure?

04:11.051 --> 04:12.083
Look.

04:12.085 --> 04:13.785
The system is maintaining
its own stability,

04:13.787 --> 04:16.721
the quantum vortex apparatus is
now controlling the orientation.

04:16.723 --> 04:18.457
(inhales)

04:18.459 --> 04:20.591
You're right.

04:20.594 --> 04:21.927
You realize what this means?

04:21.928 --> 04:23.795
Yeah.

04:23.797 --> 04:25.564
I do.

04:25.566 --> 04:28.834
It's proof of concept.

04:28.836 --> 04:30.702
We've got a
workable guidance system.

04:30.704 --> 04:33.738
Congratulations.

04:33.740 --> 04:37.442
Thanks!
(chuckles)

04:37.444 --> 04:38.810
(computer chimes)

04:38.812 --> 04:40.178
Hey,

04:40.180 --> 04:43.548
I just got an e-mail
from the U.S. Air Force.

04:43.550 --> 04:45.350
Open it.

04:45.352 --> 04:46.551
Hmm.

04:46.553 --> 04:48.487
"We request a meeting at your
earliest convenience

04:48.489 --> 04:50.288
"regarding your
quantum guidance system,

04:50.290 --> 04:53.859
provisional patent 62/295118."

04:53.861 --> 04:57.028
That's weird.

04:57.030 --> 05:01.233
Is there a window around
here we don't know about?

05:01.235 --> 05:03.468
I'm sure
it's just a coincidence.

05:03.470 --> 05:04.436
Yeah, of course.

05:04.438 --> 05:05.904
What else could it be?

05:05.906 --> 05:09.941
(raised voice):
Boy, do I love America.

05:12.145 --> 05:14.145
Thank you for picking me up.

05:14.147 --> 05:16.615
Oh, you're welcome.

05:16.617 --> 05:18.984
I was speaking to
your young lady.

05:18.986 --> 05:20.685
My pleasure, Mrs. Cooper.

05:20.687 --> 05:21.953
Oh, please call me Mary.

05:21.955 --> 05:24.389
Okay, Mary.

05:25.626 --> 05:27.359
You know,
that doesn't work for me,

05:27.361 --> 05:29.594
let's stay with Mrs. Cooper.

05:29.596 --> 05:31.563
Sheldon, don't be silly.

05:31.565 --> 05:32.998
Wait, what?

05:33.000 --> 05:35.160
That's what I called you
till I got to know you better.

05:36.169 --> 05:39.771
It was so nice of Leonard
and Penny to invite me.

05:39.773 --> 05:42.641
Well, actually, I...
It sure was.

05:42.643 --> 05:45.644
I've always had a special place
in my heart for Leonard.

05:45.646 --> 05:47.279
Taking care of my baby
all these years.

05:47.281 --> 05:49.114
Excuse me,

05:49.116 --> 05:50.348
I take care of <i>him.</i>

05:50.350 --> 05:52.317
Sure you do.

05:53.186 --> 05:55.887
So who else is coming
to this shindig?

05:55.889 --> 05:57.489
Oh, well, the usual gang.

05:57.491 --> 05:59.357
Penny's family
is coming tomorrow.

05:59.359 --> 06:00.859
Yeah, and Leonard's mother's
already here.

06:00.861 --> 06:02.427
Oh, Beverly.

06:02.429 --> 06:03.828
How nice.

06:03.830 --> 06:06.097
You've met her, right?

06:06.099 --> 06:08.867
Yes, I have.

06:10.704 --> 06:12.170
Mother, she's an atheist,

06:12.172 --> 06:14.806
not a vampire.

06:14.808 --> 06:18.810
Either way, let's stop
and get some garlic.

06:30.724 --> 06:33.124
So, Mary, how have you been?

06:33.126 --> 06:34.392
Well, thank you
so much for asking.

06:34.394 --> 06:35.427
I've been well, and you?

06:35.429 --> 06:38.763
Very good.
Good.

06:38.765 --> 06:40.465
I don't know what

06:40.467 --> 06:44.235
we were worried about;
they're getting along great.

06:44.237 --> 06:46.404
Sheldon tells me
your husband's coming.

06:46.406 --> 06:47.439
My ex-husband.

06:47.441 --> 06:48.573
Oh, I'm so sorry.

06:48.575 --> 06:49.341
Don't be.

06:49.343 --> 06:50.976
All right.

06:50.978 --> 06:53.278
Whew, chilly.

06:53.280 --> 06:55.180
I think I can see my breath.

06:55.182 --> 06:56.081
We can hear you.

06:56.083 --> 06:58.216
Sorry.
Sorry.

06:59.453 --> 07:01.920
I can't believe I was so naive.

07:01.922 --> 07:04.089
The military is just gonna

07:04.091 --> 07:05.857
take over the whole project.

07:05.859 --> 07:08.660
And you know what happens
if we object?

07:08.662 --> 07:09.894
We disappear.

07:09.896 --> 07:11.062
(nervous chuckle)

07:11.064 --> 07:12.263
Like off the map.

07:12.265 --> 07:14.699
Like every <i>American Idol</i> winner
since season four.

07:17.270 --> 07:19.170
Come on, Howard,
you're overreacting.

07:19.172 --> 07:20.939
Am I?

07:20.941 --> 07:24.142
(whispers):
Am I?

07:24.144 --> 07:26.811
Wha-- what do you want to bet
some black ops guy

07:26.813 --> 07:28.813
is reprinting
my high school yearbook

07:28.815 --> 07:31.549
and I'm no longer in it?

07:31.551 --> 07:33.752
That chess club picture is now

07:33.754 --> 07:35.620
just David Zimmerman
and Elaine Cho.

07:35.622 --> 07:39.557
Okay, look,
I'm on the Air Force Web site,

07:39.559 --> 07:40.692
and the department
that e-mailed you

07:40.694 --> 07:41.793
is in charge of acquisitions.

07:41.795 --> 07:43.395
So maybe they just
want to give you

07:43.397 --> 07:44.896
a lot of money
for your invention.

07:44.898 --> 07:47.332
Oh, please, that's
not how it works.

07:47.334 --> 07:49.934
You saw <i>E.T., Avatar,</i>
<i>Jurassic World.</i>

07:49.936 --> 07:54.239
The military just shows up
and takes over.

07:54.241 --> 07:57.008
You do realize those weren't
documentaries, right?

07:57.010 --> 07:59.477
(chuckles)

07:59.479 --> 08:01.212
I'm sorry, you find this funny?

08:01.214 --> 08:03.782
No, I was just thinking
about <i>Jurassic World.</i>

08:03.784 --> 08:05.784
Boy, that was terrible.

08:15.462 --> 08:16.695
Oh, we have to use the stairs.

08:16.697 --> 08:18.496
When are they gonna fix
your elevator?

08:18.498 --> 08:20.331
Uh... I don't-- any day now.

08:20.333 --> 08:24.102
Well, the stairs are fine.

08:24.104 --> 08:27.505
Besides, your
mother is up there.

08:27.507 --> 08:30.341
Maybe I'll have a heart attack
and not have to see her.

08:33.013 --> 08:35.313
Hey, I, I know things
are a little rough

08:35.315 --> 08:36.681
with you and Mom,

08:36.683 --> 08:38.783
but I'm really
glad you're here.

08:38.784 --> 08:40.552
Me, too.
(chuckles)

08:43.390 --> 08:47.192
I should have never had that
angioplasty because I feel fine.

08:50.464 --> 08:52.497
Penny's really looking
forward to seeing you.

08:52.499 --> 08:54.332
Ah, she's a sweetie.

08:54.334 --> 08:56.735
You got a good one there,
Leonard.

08:56.737 --> 08:59.437
Thanks, Dad.

08:59.439 --> 09:02.540
How the hell did you do that?

09:03.744 --> 09:05.677
(celery crunches loudly)

09:19.159 --> 09:20.658
(loud crunching)

09:26.066 --> 09:27.699
Isn't this nice?

09:27.701 --> 09:28.967
(door opens)

09:28.969 --> 09:30.368
Hey, we're here.

09:30.370 --> 09:31.569
Alfred!

09:31.571 --> 09:33.271
Thank you for coming!
Oh.

09:33.273 --> 09:34.672
Well, happy to be here.

09:34.674 --> 09:36.508
And congratulations.
Thank you.

09:36.510 --> 09:37.909
Dad, you remember Sheldon.

09:37.911 --> 09:38.877
Dr. Hofstadter.

09:38.879 --> 09:40.345
Dr. Cooper.

09:40.347 --> 09:41.980
This is Sheldon's mother, Mary.
How do you do?

09:41.982 --> 09:43.181
Nice to meet you.

09:43.183 --> 09:44.349
And his girlfriend, Amy.

09:44.351 --> 09:45.950
A pleasure.
Hi.

09:45.952 --> 09:47.185
And, of course, Mom.

09:47.187 --> 09:49.387
Hello, my hateful shrew.

09:52.459 --> 09:55.994
Hello to you,
you wrinkled old bastard.

09:58.231 --> 10:01.866
All right, now I'm starting
to sense a little tension.

10:10.465 --> 10:12.265
All right, you two, don't start.

10:12.267 --> 10:15.434
Penny and I are throwing this
second wedding for your benefit.

10:15.436 --> 10:16.936
Can you please not ruin it?

10:16.938 --> 10:18.638
Of course. I'm sorry.

10:18.640 --> 10:20.239
Oh, look at that--
you can apologize.

10:20.241 --> 10:22.241
Mom!
I'm sorry.

10:23.144 --> 10:24.343
You know, the Bible
says forgiveness...

10:24.345 --> 10:26.212
Mom!
I'm sorry.

10:27.782 --> 10:28.981
Uh, who's hungry?

10:28.983 --> 10:30.716
We have a reservation
at the best restaurant in town.

10:30.718 --> 10:32.552
It only got three-and-a-half
stars on Yelp.

10:32.554 --> 10:35.121
Sheldon!
I'm not sorry. That's true.

10:37.592 --> 10:38.758
I don't know what to do.

10:38.760 --> 10:40.059
It's the Air Force.

10:40.061 --> 10:42.061
I mean, should I respond
to their e-mail?

10:42.063 --> 10:43.296
Ignore it?

10:43.298 --> 10:44.597
You can't ignore it.

10:44.599 --> 10:46.065
It's not that postcard
that says it's time

10:46.067 --> 10:47.800
to go back to the dentist.

10:49.170 --> 10:50.203
Guys, come on.

10:50.205 --> 10:51.304
We're meeting everyone
for dinner.

10:51.306 --> 10:52.438
One sec. I'm just afraid

10:52.440 --> 10:54.473
if I respond,
then they'll know I got it.

10:54.475 --> 10:55.575
Oh, dude.

10:55.577 --> 10:56.876
The minute you opened
that e-mail,

10:56.878 --> 10:57.977
they knew you got it.

10:57.979 --> 10:59.111
I mean, they're probably
looking at you

10:59.113 --> 11:01.380
through the camera right now.
Oh, damn.

11:03.284 --> 11:04.951
I love America.

11:07.589 --> 11:09.021
Are you done with this nonsense?

11:09.023 --> 11:10.256
It's not nonsense.

11:10.258 --> 11:12.191
This is how the
U.S. military works.

11:12.193 --> 11:13.759
Oh, if it's even
the U.S. military.

11:13.761 --> 11:16.629
It could be foreign military
pretending to be American.

11:16.631 --> 11:19.031
You're right. We turn our
guidance system over to them,

11:19.033 --> 11:21.467
next thing we know,
they're using it against us.

11:23.238 --> 11:26.005
I also love the enemies
of America.

11:35.083 --> 11:38.117
Penny, I hope the example
of my failed marriage

11:38.119 --> 11:40.519
to Leonard's father
doesn't discourage you

11:40.521 --> 11:42.788
from the commitment
you've made to one another.

11:42.790 --> 11:45.958
Oh, of course not.

11:45.960 --> 11:50.029
Although Alfred and I had a lot
more going for us than you two.

11:51.599 --> 11:55.001
Mom, please save something
for the toast.

11:59.140 --> 12:02.141
So, Alfred, what is it
that you do for a living?

12:02.143 --> 12:03.409
Oh, I'm an anthropologist.

12:03.411 --> 12:06.112
I study ancient peoples
and cultures.

12:06.114 --> 12:08.114
My goodness, so all the way
back to the Flood.

12:08.116 --> 12:10.983
(laughing)

12:10.985 --> 12:13.486
Don't laugh--
she wasn't joking.

12:13.488 --> 12:15.821
Play with your phone.

12:19.394 --> 12:21.093
Well, on that note,

12:21.095 --> 12:23.963
there are many cultures
that have an apocalyptic flood

12:23.965 --> 12:25.464
as part of their mythology.

12:25.466 --> 12:27.166
I don't have a mythology.

12:27.168 --> 12:28.901
I have the unerring Word of God.

12:28.903 --> 12:30.303
But that's very interesting.

12:30.305 --> 12:31.570
Oh.

12:31.572 --> 12:33.673
I-I didn't mean to
disparage your faith.

12:33.675 --> 12:35.441
Actually, I admire it.

12:35.443 --> 12:36.709
Really?
Yes.

12:36.711 --> 12:38.177
Yes, I'm an agnostic myself,

12:38.179 --> 12:40.479
but I have prayed,
many times, to God,

12:40.481 --> 12:44.016
to turn my wife
into a pillar of salt.

12:44.852 --> 12:46.152
Well, He came close.

12:46.154 --> 12:48.187
Turned her into
a giant block of ice.

12:48.189 --> 12:50.690
(both laughing)

12:53.194 --> 12:55.061
Howard, there must be someone
at the university

12:55.063 --> 12:56.329
you can go to for help.

12:56.331 --> 12:57.897
Are you kidding?

12:57.899 --> 12:59.465
They're probably the ones
who leaked it

12:59.467 --> 13:01.267
to the military
in the first place.

13:02.403 --> 13:05.271
What about the guy
on the Channel Four News?

13:05.273 --> 13:07.473
You know,
"Four on Your Side"?

13:07.475 --> 13:09.375
Maybe he can be on <i>your</i> side.

13:10.845 --> 13:13.145
I'm being harassed
by the government,

13:13.147 --> 13:16.749
not trying to get to the bottom
of a dog-walking scam.

13:18.052 --> 13:19.585
Oh, stop!

13:19.587 --> 13:21.153
You know what's
really happening?

13:21.155 --> 13:22.688
All the movies
you've watched,

13:22.690 --> 13:24.090
the TV shows, the comic books--

13:24.092 --> 13:25.791
they've completely twisted
your thinking.

13:25.793 --> 13:27.360
No one's after you,
no one's listening to you,

13:27.362 --> 13:29.395
no one cares about you.

13:31.199 --> 13:32.431
I'd like to think

13:32.433 --> 13:34.934
the "Four on Your Side" guy
cares about me.

13:37.905 --> 13:39.972
You know, Beverly,
I know you and Alfred

13:39.974 --> 13:42.675
have your differences,
but if you think about it,

13:42.677 --> 13:45.277
if you hadn't married him,
there'd be no Leonard.

13:45.279 --> 13:46.479
(chuckles)

13:46.481 --> 13:47.980
So that's good, right?

13:47.982 --> 13:49.014
Eh.

13:54.722 --> 13:57.189
Is that Howard
in front of us?

13:57.191 --> 13:58.758
Oh, maybe.

13:58.760 --> 14:00.659
Get closer.

14:02.296 --> 14:03.963
Oh, God.

14:03.965 --> 14:06.766
I think someone's
following us.

14:06.768 --> 14:09.068
You're being ridiculous.

14:09.070 --> 14:11.837
I'm not being ridiculous--
he's right on my tail.

14:11.839 --> 14:14.807
Uh, turn left here
and see if he turns with us.

14:15.877 --> 14:17.977
Well, why is
he turning here?

14:17.979 --> 14:19.845
The restaurant's the other way.
I don't know.

14:19.847 --> 14:22.214
He uses that traffic app.
Maybe there's an accident.

14:22.216 --> 14:23.716
Oh, so follow him.

14:26.254 --> 14:27.520
Oh, no!

14:29.690 --> 14:31.524
I told you!

14:31.526 --> 14:34.126
It's probably
just a coincidence.

14:34.128 --> 14:36.762
Speed up a little,
see if he stays with you.

14:36.764 --> 14:38.297
Well, go faster.

14:38.299 --> 14:39.665
You're losing him.
What is his hurry?

14:39.667 --> 14:40.966
You know what,
flash your lights.

14:40.968 --> 14:42.234
Let him know it's you.

14:43.070 --> 14:44.570
He's flashing his lights.

14:44.572 --> 14:46.005
What's that mean?

14:46.007 --> 14:47.807
I-I think he wants us
to pull over.

14:47.809 --> 14:49.341
Do not pull over!

14:49.343 --> 14:50.743
I'm not raising this baby alone!

14:52.780 --> 14:53.879
Hang on!

14:53.881 --> 14:56.148
(engine revving)

14:57.351 --> 15:00.352
So, after
your husband passed,

15:00.354 --> 15:02.021
you never remarried?

15:02.023 --> 15:04.557
No, just focused on work
and the church.

15:04.559 --> 15:05.825
Ah. And what do you do?

15:05.827 --> 15:08.027
I work at the church.

15:09.363 --> 15:11.330
Well, they're lucky
to have you.

15:11.332 --> 15:13.299
MARY:
Well, thank you.

15:13.301 --> 15:15.367
You're welcome.

15:15.369 --> 15:17.503
Do you realize
what's happening here?

15:17.505 --> 15:19.071
Yeah, I do.

15:19.073 --> 15:21.774
They're filling up on bread
and ruining their meal.

15:25.313 --> 15:26.345
Hey.
AMY: Hey.

15:26.347 --> 15:27.913
What took you guys so long?

15:27.915 --> 15:30.082
Oh, we were following Howard,
but for some reason,

15:30.084 --> 15:32.751
he turned off his headlights
and went up a one-way street.

15:34.322 --> 15:35.888
So, what did we miss?

15:35.890 --> 15:37.990
Oh, just Mary and I getting
to know each other a little.

15:37.992 --> 15:40.292
Leonard, your father
is just charming.

15:40.294 --> 15:41.327
He's also broke.

15:41.329 --> 15:42.761
Did he mention that?

15:44.999 --> 15:48.067
Okay, Mom,
you sit over there...

15:49.504 --> 15:51.871
And I'm gonna call Bernadette
and see what's keeping them.

15:53.274 --> 15:54.974
If I'd known you were broke,

15:54.976 --> 15:57.243
I wouldn't have made
a big deal about the bread.

16:02.316 --> 16:03.749
Hey, Penny.

16:04.752 --> 16:06.252
What are you talking about?

16:08.489 --> 16:10.589
Oh, that was you?

16:10.591 --> 16:12.091
(chuckles)

16:12.093 --> 16:13.592
Long story.

16:13.594 --> 16:15.127
Why don't you go ahead and eat.

16:15.129 --> 16:16.428
We're gonna be a while.

16:20.668 --> 16:22.935
I'm telling you,
I'm not on drugs.

16:22.937 --> 16:25.938
The government's out to get me!

16:28.676 --> 16:31.544
Now, one of the more exciting
things to be found recently

16:31.546 --> 16:33.078
is that Neanderthals

16:33.080 --> 16:36.482
and Homo sapiens frequently
mated with each other.

16:36.484 --> 16:39.852
Well, that certainly explains
my marriage to Sheldon's father.

16:39.854 --> 16:41.620
(laughs)

16:42.857 --> 16:46.592
That's funny, because my father
was not a very clever man.

16:47.461 --> 16:49.261
I'd be lost without you.

16:51.499 --> 16:52.464
(utensil clinking on glass)

16:52.466 --> 16:54.667
Uh, I would like
to propose a toast

16:54.669 --> 16:56.569
to my wife and bride-to-be.

16:56.571 --> 16:57.836
See, that's funny because...

16:57.838 --> 16:59.004
Back to your phone.

17:01.842 --> 17:03.676
Penny...

17:03.678 --> 17:05.743
I've always known I loved you,

17:05.746 --> 17:08.247
but this last year has shown me

17:08.249 --> 17:10.482
that I also love
being married to you.

17:10.483 --> 17:12.984
Thank you
for saying yes.

17:12.987 --> 17:16.121
Oh, thanks for asking
until I did.

17:16.958 --> 17:18.156
Hear, hear.

17:18.159 --> 17:19.391
Cheers.

17:20.861 --> 17:23.395
I, uh, I would also like
to make a toast.

17:23.396 --> 17:24.363
Aw.

17:24.365 --> 17:26.265
(chuckles)
Leonard,

17:26.267 --> 17:28.534
I am so happy
that you have found a woman

17:28.536 --> 17:30.469
who loves and cares for you.

17:30.471 --> 17:32.638
What the hell is that
supposed to mean?

17:34.575 --> 17:36.408
Why don't you take a pill?

17:36.410 --> 17:38.110
Like you did before sex?

17:38.112 --> 17:39.845
What I really needed

17:39.847 --> 17:41.647
was a blindfold.

17:41.649 --> 17:43.215
All right, everyone...

17:43.217 --> 17:44.683
calm down.

17:44.685 --> 17:46.418
Let's all remember what
it says in the Bible:

17:46.420 --> 17:48.554
"He who is slow to anger

17:48.556 --> 17:50.789
is better than the mighty."

17:50.791 --> 17:53.993
Oh, dear woman, can you please
read another book?

17:55.029 --> 17:58.397
When God writes one, I will.

18:00.735 --> 18:02.001
(clears throat)

18:04.472 --> 18:07.840
Um, if-if we want to order
the soufflé,

18:07.842 --> 18:10.042
we might want to get on that.

18:14.015 --> 18:16.482
Leonard, if you don't mind,
I-I think I'm a little tired.

18:16.484 --> 18:17.683
I'm gonna call it a night.

18:17.685 --> 18:19.184
Sure, Dad.

18:19.186 --> 18:21.053
I'm a little
tuckered out myself,

18:21.055 --> 18:23.188
so I will see you all
in the morning.

18:24.225 --> 18:25.724
Would you like
to share a cab?

18:25.726 --> 18:26.925
That would be fine.

18:26.927 --> 18:28.560
Where are you staying?
I'm at the Westin.

18:28.562 --> 18:29.795
Oh, so am I.

18:29.797 --> 18:31.130
Can I interest you
in a nightcap?

18:31.132 --> 18:33.565
I think that you could.

18:38.305 --> 18:40.572
What is happening there?

18:40.574 --> 18:43.108
I think it's pretty obvious.

18:43.110 --> 18:45.444
They don't want dessert
'cause they filled up on bread.

18:56.612 --> 18:58.412
She's still not answering.

18:59.615 --> 19:02.616
My father's not texting me back.

19:04.453 --> 19:07.621
(singsongy): 'Cause they both
turned their phones off.

19:12.661 --> 19:15.796
I don't like this at all.

19:15.798 --> 19:17.431
I don't like it either.

19:17.433 --> 19:18.699
Really?

19:18.701 --> 19:20.768
(laughing):
'Cause I love it.
