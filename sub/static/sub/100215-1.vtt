00:52.574 --> 00:53.749
[man grunts]

00:56.752 --> 00:59.407
It's no use, Katie.
Nowhere left to run.

00:59.450 --> 01:01.365
Come on, Nick.
What are you gonna do?

01:01.409 --> 01:03.367
-What, are you gonna kill me?
-Why not?

01:03.411 --> 01:06.153
-You're already dead.
-Just don't do this, Nick...

01:06.196 --> 01:09.460
Nick, don't! No!

01:11.245 --> 01:12.420
[Chloe] We're doing much better,
so I think

01:12.463 --> 01:14.117
we're gonna get away
this weekend.

01:14.161 --> 01:15.727
-Nice!
-Yeah, you can cover for me?

01:15.771 --> 01:18.774
-[chuckles] Absolutely.
-Awesome.

01:18.817 --> 01:21.211
Actually, um,
that was my last table.

01:21.255 --> 01:22.386
Do you mind if I cut out early?

01:22.430 --> 01:23.387
[Chloe] Not at all.

01:23.431 --> 01:24.736
[Anna] All right, thanks.

01:24.780 --> 01:27.522
Oh, you just got somebody.

01:28.610 --> 01:29.785
You want me to take it?

01:31.308 --> 01:33.310
No. No, that's okay. I got it.

01:35.617 --> 01:37.749
-Good afternoon. My name's Anna.
-Hey.

01:37.793 --> 01:40.100
I will be your server
this afternoon.

01:40.143 --> 01:41.362
If you have any questions,
just let me know.

01:41.405 --> 01:44.539
Will do. Hey, um...

01:44.582 --> 01:47.324
Don't we go to the same gym?

01:47.368 --> 01:50.849
I'm sorry, I meant
questions about the menu.

01:50.893 --> 01:53.678
Right. Uh,
what's, what's good here?

01:53.722 --> 01:56.420
Um, let's see.
The fried catfish is good.

01:56.464 --> 01:59.467
Um, the halibuts,
roast chicken is really--

01:59.510 --> 02:01.512
You know, I watch you sometimes.

02:02.687 --> 02:04.124
At the gym.

02:05.386 --> 02:07.257
Oh.

02:07.301 --> 02:09.520
I just meant that I noticed you
'cause you, you know,

02:09.564 --> 02:11.870
you stand out.

02:11.914 --> 02:13.611
I know you're not from here
and people don't,

02:13.655 --> 02:15.570
don't really move to this town.
Where are you from?

02:15.613 --> 02:17.354
So, I think
we're out of the shrimp tacos

02:17.398 --> 02:18.877
and also the salmon, I think.

02:18.921 --> 02:20.836
I can double-check with the chef
if you like.

02:20.879 --> 02:23.491
It's okay.
I see what you're doing.

02:23.534 --> 02:25.275
What am I doing?

02:25.319 --> 02:26.624
Trying to throw me off my game.

02:26.668 --> 02:28.844
[chuckles]
Well, that's very cute.

02:28.887 --> 02:31.847
-What?
-That you think you've a game.

02:33.501 --> 02:34.763
Ouch.

02:38.680 --> 02:40.334
You know, you sweat a lot.

02:42.901 --> 02:44.425
That's true.

02:46.557 --> 02:49.386
You maybe wanna
go out with me sometime?

02:49.430 --> 02:51.475
Uh, like,
like a different restaurant?

02:51.519 --> 02:52.520
[Anna] Uh...

02:53.695 --> 02:56.306
You know what, I-I'm sorry, no.

02:56.350 --> 02:58.569
-I don't think so.
-Why not?

03:00.223 --> 03:01.790
I don't date customers.

03:01.833 --> 03:04.227
-I'll find another restaurant.
-Really?

03:04.271 --> 03:06.273
-I'll leave right now.
-And another gym, as well?

03:06.316 --> 03:08.710
Yeah. I'll cancel
my membership, whatever.

03:09.537 --> 03:11.582
Just think about it.

03:13.323 --> 03:14.498
Okay.

03:14.542 --> 03:15.543
Cool.

03:16.413 --> 03:18.198
No.

03:18.241 --> 03:19.416
Nice try, though.

03:22.680 --> 03:25.683
[upbeat music]

03:27.642 --> 03:30.906
[gasping]
Danny, that was amazing!

03:32.734 --> 03:34.736
-[whistling]
-Whoa!

03:36.259 --> 03:39.219
-So you don't like him?
-Who?

03:39.262 --> 03:41.525
-Blue eyes, from the restaurant.
-Oh...

03:41.569 --> 03:44.963
-He's cute.
-Why were you so mean to him?

03:45.007 --> 03:47.227
Mean? I was flirting.

03:48.706 --> 03:50.317
Okay, so maybe
I'm a little rusty.

03:50.360 --> 03:52.449
[Chloe] Mm,
you're way beyond rusty.

03:53.798 --> 03:55.539
Do you even want a boyfriend?

03:57.933 --> 04:00.631
Why do I need a boyfriend
when we have all of this?

04:00.675 --> 04:02.242
Yeah!

04:03.591 --> 04:05.723
[Anna] Nice one.

04:05.767 --> 04:07.812
-Good job, guys.
-Good job.

04:07.856 --> 04:10.554
-Hey, babe. Do you want another?
-[Chloe] Uh, no, I'm good.

04:10.598 --> 04:12.774
-Good. You? Sure?
-I'm good. Thanks, Leon.

04:12.817 --> 04:13.905
[Leon] All right.

04:17.692 --> 04:19.389
[Chloe] When was the last time
you went on a date?

04:19.433 --> 04:21.608
Ugh... I don't know.

04:22.479 --> 04:23.741
Before Danny?

04:25.352 --> 04:27.310
Look, you don't have kids, okay?

04:27.354 --> 04:31.445
-They change your priorities.
-I have Kayla.

04:31.488 --> 04:33.751
She's Leon's daughter.
You don't live with her.

04:33.795 --> 04:36.841
I still have, uh,
maternal feelings.

04:36.885 --> 04:38.582
Maternal... [chuckles]

04:38.626 --> 04:41.368
Darling, that top
does not say maternal.

04:41.411 --> 04:43.761
Oh, I do know that
just because you have a kid

04:43.805 --> 04:45.589
doesn't mean
you stop having sex.

04:47.330 --> 04:49.506
No, honestly, guys don't even
really approach me.

04:49.550 --> 04:51.291
Well, because you give off
that stank

04:51.334 --> 04:52.509
do-not-talk-to-me vibe.

04:52.553 --> 04:54.946
Wow, "stank." That's harsh.

04:54.990 --> 04:56.470
Okay, wow, harsh.

04:56.513 --> 04:58.776
I-I don't do it consciously.

04:58.820 --> 05:00.996
He's obviously into you.

05:01.039 --> 05:03.781
Just go out with him.
He seems so cool.

05:03.825 --> 05:06.349
-Cool, huh?
-Hot. [mumbles]

05:06.393 --> 05:07.655
Hots?

05:07.698 --> 05:08.873
Well, if you like him so much,

05:08.917 --> 05:10.527
why don't you go out with him?

05:10.571 --> 05:11.659
I have a boyfriend.

05:11.702 --> 05:13.965
Oh! Do you?

05:16.011 --> 05:18.013
[indistinct chatter]

05:19.797 --> 05:21.495
-I'll be back.
-Yeah.

05:24.411 --> 05:25.847
Hey!

05:25.890 --> 05:28.328
New girlfriend.
Nice to meet you.

05:28.371 --> 05:30.721
[indistinct chatter]

05:31.722 --> 05:33.811
Danny, nice one. Come here.

05:35.117 --> 05:37.075
Mm. Are you having fun?

05:37.119 --> 05:39.643
-Yeah?
-Kayla's beating me.

05:39.687 --> 05:43.473
Well... Are you having fun?

05:43.517 --> 05:45.867
Hm. That's what matters then.
Right?

05:45.910 --> 05:47.869
No, I wanna win.

05:47.912 --> 05:49.871
You wanna win?

05:49.914 --> 05:52.352
You wanna win?
Someone wants to win?

05:52.395 --> 05:55.659
Who's gonna win? Okay.
How about you beat me? Huh?

05:55.703 --> 05:57.095
[chuckling]

06:06.627 --> 06:08.106
Come on, Danny,
we're gonna be late.

06:11.588 --> 06:13.416
Danny, come on.

06:17.420 --> 06:19.422
Danny, come on.
What are you doing?

06:19.466 --> 06:20.902
What's happening?

06:20.945 --> 06:23.165
How come you never
talk about my father?

06:25.080 --> 06:26.951
Well, why are you asking that?

06:26.995 --> 06:29.954
Kayla says it's weird
I don't have a father.

06:33.523 --> 06:36.439
Hey. Of course,
you have a father.

06:36.483 --> 06:37.919
W-where is he?

06:41.009 --> 06:44.665
He's in the military,
overseas.

06:44.708 --> 06:47.842
How come he doesn't call us?

06:47.885 --> 06:51.976
Because
he's on a top-secret mission.

06:52.020 --> 06:54.501
What kind of top-secret mission?

06:54.544 --> 06:58.418
I don't know. That's why
they call it top-secret.

07:04.946 --> 07:06.948
Sweetie, look.

07:06.991 --> 07:10.560
I have a very complicated
relationship with your father.

07:10.604 --> 07:12.475
Okay?

07:12.519 --> 07:14.564
I'll explain it to you
when you're a little older.

07:14.608 --> 07:16.566
I'm not a little kid anymore.

07:16.610 --> 07:18.525
I know. I know.

07:21.484 --> 07:22.790
Do you miss him?

07:25.793 --> 07:26.968
No.

07:29.927 --> 07:32.495
But sometimes I miss the life
I had when I met him.

07:33.975 --> 07:36.978
[upbeat music]

07:38.849 --> 07:41.852
[mellow music]

08:00.175 --> 08:01.219
Champagne?

08:02.699 --> 08:03.874
Oh, absolutely.

08:07.878 --> 08:09.140
So what do you think?

08:11.882 --> 08:13.188
About the painting?

08:13.231 --> 08:14.929
Sure, why not?
Let's start there.

08:16.539 --> 08:17.671
I like it.

08:19.542 --> 08:21.239
Are you considering buying it?

08:21.283 --> 08:24.155
-Possibly. It depends.
-Mm...

08:24.199 --> 08:25.635
Well, I'm just
the assistant here.

08:25.679 --> 08:26.897
I can introduce you

08:26.941 --> 08:29.639
to the gallery owner
if you'd like.

08:29.683 --> 08:31.075
I want your opinion.

08:32.033 --> 08:33.121
Okay.

08:34.731 --> 08:36.211
I'm a fan of the artist.

08:36.254 --> 08:38.822
And he moved here from Russia
with literally nothing,

08:38.866 --> 08:42.609
started over here and now he has
his own solo art exhibit.

08:42.652 --> 08:44.567
-Well, it's very inspiring.
-Wow. Yeah.

08:44.611 --> 08:46.526
Yeah, I read that
in the brochure.

08:46.569 --> 08:48.528
[chuckling]

08:48.571 --> 08:50.791
I just can't decide
if I love it.

08:55.622 --> 08:56.840
Don't buy it.

08:56.884 --> 08:59.669
-You seem sure about that.
-I am.

08:59.713 --> 09:02.106
I mean, you're gonna have
to look at it every day. Right?

09:02.150 --> 09:04.152
So you should love it

09:04.195 --> 09:07.677
without any reservations.

09:07.721 --> 09:10.027
You feel that way
about relationships, too?

09:10.071 --> 09:13.030
Who said anything
about relationships?

09:13.074 --> 09:14.858
Show me your favorite painting.

09:15.816 --> 09:17.644
-Really?
-Oh, yeah.

09:18.601 --> 09:20.647
-Okay.
-I'm Nick.

09:22.953 --> 09:24.085
I'm Kate.

09:25.260 --> 09:26.827
My friends call me Katie.

09:28.306 --> 09:31.005
Right this way.

09:31.048 --> 09:32.049
[Katie] Hi, Grace.

09:32.093 --> 09:33.311
Do you mind if I, um,

09:33.355 --> 09:34.748
show this gentleman up here?

09:38.752 --> 09:39.927
[clears throat]

09:46.107 --> 09:48.065
Thanks for taking
my recommendation.

09:48.109 --> 09:49.893
It's a beautiful piece.

09:49.937 --> 09:52.592
Well, I can tell
you have impeccable taste.

09:53.288 --> 09:55.246
I might.

09:55.290 --> 09:58.162
Do you have any idea
where you're gonna hang it?

09:58.206 --> 10:00.295
Oh, I can use your opinion
on that, too.

10:29.063 --> 10:30.760
You are so beautiful.

10:33.415 --> 10:36.157
[bell ringing]

10:36.200 --> 10:39.203
[indistinct chatter]

10:43.817 --> 10:45.383
-Hey, you need help?
-Yeah.

10:45.427 --> 10:47.951
-No. I'm okay.
-You got it?

10:47.995 --> 10:50.214
Oh! Honey,
oh, don't forget your lunch.

10:50.258 --> 10:52.739
-Thanks.
-Bye, sweetie, I love you.

10:52.782 --> 10:53.783
Bye.

10:53.827 --> 10:56.830
[instrumental music]

11:03.097 --> 11:06.013
[line ringing]

11:06.056 --> 11:08.711
-[Evelyn] Hello?
-Hey, mom.

11:08.755 --> 11:10.713
Did you change
your phone number again?

11:10.757 --> 11:12.846
[Katie] Um, yeah.
I got another brand new phone.

11:12.889 --> 11:15.196
-I know I sound paranoid.
-Oh, I get it.

11:15.239 --> 11:17.764
I just worry about you being
stressed out all the time.

11:17.807 --> 11:21.158
[sighs] I'm fine.
I'm, uh, I'm driving to work.

11:21.202 --> 11:22.725
I just dropped
Danny off at school.

11:22.769 --> 11:25.728
Oh, sweet thing. How is he?

11:25.772 --> 11:29.036
Too smart for his own good.
He started asking about Nick.

11:29.079 --> 11:32.692
Well, that was inevitable.
What'd you tell him?

11:32.735 --> 11:35.825
I told him he was overseas,
in the military.

11:35.869 --> 11:37.740
He's gonna figure out
you're lying.

11:37.784 --> 11:39.437
Kids are very intuitive.

11:39.481 --> 11:41.788
I know, I know.

11:41.831 --> 11:44.007
He's already asking
a lot of questions.

11:44.051 --> 11:46.444
I can't wait to meet him
someday.

11:46.488 --> 11:48.229
-You will.
-When?

11:49.883 --> 11:50.840
I don't know.

11:50.884 --> 11:52.929
I wanna see you, too, Katie.

11:52.973 --> 11:54.844
I wish you wouldn't
call me that, mom.

11:54.888 --> 11:57.064
You're always gonna be
Katie to me.

11:57.107 --> 11:59.719
Aren't you tired
of living like a criminal?

11:59.762 --> 12:01.895
You know,
I really don't have a choice.

12:01.938 --> 12:03.287
I just want you home.

12:03.331 --> 12:05.246
Hey, listen, check your PO box.

12:05.289 --> 12:08.466
I sent you a package.
New pictures of Danny.

12:08.510 --> 12:10.947
Oh. Wonderful.

12:10.991 --> 12:13.384
Listen, just please don't put
them where anyone can see them.

12:13.428 --> 12:17.214
I know. You don't have
to keep telling me that.

12:17.258 --> 12:20.087
-I miss you. -You know I miss you, too, mom.

12:21.131 --> 12:22.176
Every day.

12:23.177 --> 12:24.352
[Evelyn] Bye.

12:31.054 --> 12:34.057
[intense music]

13:00.170 --> 13:03.173
[music continues]

13:14.184 --> 13:17.013
Hi, I'll have a bag
of your Kenyan blend.

13:17.057 --> 13:20.147
-Sorry, we just ran out.
-Oh, that's a shame.

13:20.190 --> 13:22.453
I'll just have
a cappuccino then.

13:22.497 --> 13:23.933
-Name?
-Evelyn.

13:23.977 --> 13:26.196
Just give me a second.

13:26.240 --> 13:28.242
Let me get that.
I'll have a cappuccino as well.

13:28.285 --> 13:30.070
-It's okay, I got it.
-I insist.

13:30.113 --> 13:31.811
Name for the order?

13:31.854 --> 13:33.073
Nick.

13:37.860 --> 13:39.470
Hey there, Evelyn.

13:39.514 --> 13:41.298
Nick.

13:41.342 --> 13:42.952
I'm sorry.

13:42.996 --> 13:46.477
Just a bit of a shock
seeing you after all this time.

13:46.521 --> 13:49.045
-How have you been?
-Thanks.

13:49.089 --> 13:51.482
I've been away.
Just got back to town.

13:52.919 --> 13:54.572
How about you?

13:54.616 --> 13:56.836
I'm getting by, you know?

13:56.879 --> 14:00.143
You must miss Katie. I remember
how close you two were.

14:00.187 --> 14:02.842
I think about her every day.

14:02.885 --> 14:04.191
Look, I wanted
to reach out to you

14:04.234 --> 14:06.323
ever since Katie's memorial.

14:06.367 --> 14:08.238
Why didn't you?

14:08.282 --> 14:09.979
I thought you might blame me,

14:10.023 --> 14:11.851
you might hold me responsible.

14:13.113 --> 14:15.332
Katie's...

14:15.376 --> 14:17.857
She was a troubled girl.

14:17.900 --> 14:20.511
It's not your fault
she did what she did.

14:20.555 --> 14:23.514
I just wish I'd seen it,
you know?

14:23.558 --> 14:25.516
I wish I knew
how much pain she was in.

14:25.560 --> 14:27.562
We all do.

14:27.605 --> 14:30.391
But I, I think
she's in a better place.

14:30.434 --> 14:34.177
I hope so.
She was such a special person.

14:34.221 --> 14:35.613
She was.

14:35.657 --> 14:37.964
And I'm still angry with her
for what she did,

14:38.007 --> 14:40.401
but... at some point

14:40.444 --> 14:43.360
we have to move on
with our lives.

14:43.404 --> 14:45.449
Yeah. Of course.

14:45.493 --> 14:48.017
I'm actually
engaged to be married.

14:48.061 --> 14:50.454
Oh. That's wonderful.

14:50.498 --> 14:52.543
I'm happy for you, really.

14:52.587 --> 14:54.241
[man] Evelyn. Nick.

14:55.546 --> 14:57.374
Well, it was nice to see you,
Nick.

14:59.246 --> 15:00.900
Can I tell you a secret?

15:02.249 --> 15:03.946
I have a fantasy.

15:05.078 --> 15:06.906
Katie's still alive.

15:08.037 --> 15:09.952
What do you mean?

15:09.996 --> 15:12.389
That she didn't actually
kill herself.

15:12.433 --> 15:15.653
It was all a grand plan...

15:17.307 --> 15:19.353
'cause she was
such a clever woman, you know?

15:20.441 --> 15:22.051
That's impossible.

15:22.095 --> 15:24.401
I know, I know. It just...

15:24.445 --> 15:26.403
It just makes me happy

15:26.447 --> 15:28.971
thinking of her living her life
somewhere free,

15:29.015 --> 15:30.625
no trouble...

15:30.668 --> 15:33.062
That is a lovely thought.

15:33.106 --> 15:34.585
-Good to see you, Evelyn.
-You, too.

15:34.629 --> 15:36.457
And thanks for the coffee.

15:41.114 --> 15:42.376
That chick in the yoga pants

15:42.419 --> 15:43.986
has sent her food back
three times.

15:44.030 --> 15:47.468
-Oh, yeah. Sorry.
-She hates me.

15:47.511 --> 15:50.558
-She just has it out for me.
-Yeah. I-I saw that. Sorry.

15:50.601 --> 15:51.994
What the hell
are you doing here?

15:52.038 --> 15:53.300
-Hey, Leon.
-Coming to have lunch.

15:53.343 --> 15:55.955
Since when do you eat here?

15:55.998 --> 15:58.696
I miss you.
I miss our movie nights.

15:58.740 --> 16:00.524
-Don't... touch me.
-I miss cuddle time.

16:00.568 --> 16:03.049
Why are you always acting like
I'm some kind of player?

16:03.092 --> 16:05.486
My grams still does my laundry.

16:05.529 --> 16:07.618
Mom, are you calling
from your cell phone?

16:07.662 --> 16:10.491
-Yes.
-I told you that's dangerous.

16:10.534 --> 16:14.974
You're right. I'm sorry. I was
just excited to talk to you.

16:15.017 --> 16:16.323
[Katie] What's going on?

16:16.366 --> 16:18.194
What would you think
of me visiting you?

16:18.238 --> 16:20.283
[Evelyn] How long do you think
the drive is?

16:20.327 --> 16:24.026
-Five or six hours?
-Mom, you know we can't do that.

16:24.070 --> 16:26.463
-No, that's impossible.
-No, listen.

16:26.507 --> 16:29.118
I ran into Nick today
at the coffee place.

16:29.162 --> 16:32.252
-And he's changed.
-Wait a minute, he's back?

16:32.295 --> 16:34.167
Oh, please tell me
you're kidding.

16:34.210 --> 16:35.385
No, he's moved on, Katie.

16:35.429 --> 16:37.387
He's, he's engaged
to be married.

16:37.431 --> 16:38.693
You spoke with him?

16:38.736 --> 16:41.000
He's different
than I remember him.

16:41.043 --> 16:43.524
-Sincere.
-He's lying.

16:43.567 --> 16:46.396
He's manipulating you, okay?
That's what he does.

16:46.440 --> 16:48.137
It's not like that at all.

16:48.181 --> 16:51.010
I bet he followed you there.
What did you say?

16:51.053 --> 16:53.577
Nothing. I played the role
of the grieving mother.

16:53.621 --> 16:57.016
-You'll be proud.
-Tell me exactly what he said.

16:57.059 --> 16:59.235
I can't remember every word.

16:59.279 --> 17:00.671
Try.

17:00.715 --> 17:03.674
He said he has a fantasy
that you're still alive,

17:03.718 --> 17:08.069
that you're just living
your life like normal.

17:08.114 --> 17:10.159
He knows.

17:10.203 --> 17:11.595
Do you really think
he'd follow me?

17:11.638 --> 17:13.292
Yes, mom,
that's why I have never

17:13.336 --> 17:14.424
given you my home address.

17:14.468 --> 17:16.078
That's why I drive 50 miles

17:16.122 --> 17:18.515
to the next town over
to deliver a package.

17:18.559 --> 17:21.518
But it's been years. Don't you
think he could've changed?

17:21.561 --> 17:24.347
Mom, he is a dangerous man.

17:24.391 --> 17:26.435
Okay? We cannot
underestimate him.

17:28.612 --> 17:30.397
There are things
I never told you.

17:30.440 --> 17:32.181
What things?

17:32.225 --> 17:33.661
It's better you don't know.

17:35.793 --> 17:38.100
Look, I, uh,
I gotta get back to work.

17:38.144 --> 17:39.623
Please be careful. Okay?

17:48.763 --> 17:50.591
[Nick] Thank you.

17:50.634 --> 17:52.245
What have we got here?

17:57.598 --> 18:00.079
-[Katie chuckling]
-What?

18:00.122 --> 18:01.645
You.

18:01.689 --> 18:04.083
You always pay
with the big bills.

18:04.126 --> 18:05.475
Is that unusual?

18:07.608 --> 18:10.350
I don't know. I guess
I'm just not used to this.

18:10.393 --> 18:14.789
You know,
chef's menu, sommelier.

18:14.832 --> 18:17.748
For me it's usually
just pizza and Netflix.

18:17.792 --> 18:19.620
Maybe you're hanging out
with the wrong crowd.

18:19.663 --> 18:21.100
I don't know.

18:22.144 --> 18:24.538
Maybe. Maybe.

18:27.628 --> 18:30.370
There's something old-fashioned
about you. You know that?

18:31.501 --> 18:33.199
You don't like it?

18:33.242 --> 18:34.417
I didn't say that.

18:40.293 --> 18:42.599
So, tell me about your business.

18:42.643 --> 18:43.861
What do you want to know?

18:45.602 --> 18:48.431
You never really
talk about work.

18:48.475 --> 18:50.607
-What exactly is it that you do?
-I'm an investor.

18:50.651 --> 18:53.393
I make loans to people
who get rejected by banks.

18:53.436 --> 18:56.222
Loans? So you're, like,
a loan shark?

18:56.265 --> 18:58.224
No, it's, it's connected
to real estate.

18:58.267 --> 18:59.834
It's not that interesting.

19:01.488 --> 19:02.532
Oh...

19:03.794 --> 19:06.275
-I'm interested.
-Hey, come on.

19:06.319 --> 19:08.147
I got you something.

19:08.886 --> 19:11.672
-Oh, yeah?
-Yeah.

19:11.715 --> 19:14.153
-What is it?
-Open it.

19:20.594 --> 19:21.638
Wow!

19:23.336 --> 19:25.642
Nick, these are beautiful.

19:25.686 --> 19:26.948
Try 'em on.

19:29.472 --> 19:32.606
-They look really expensive.
-So?

19:32.649 --> 19:35.435
You're so beautiful. I want you
to have beautiful things.

19:41.441 --> 19:43.486
Don't you think we're moving
a little fast here?

19:52.365 --> 19:54.497
What, I can't buy you gifts?

19:54.541 --> 19:58.501
Well, sure you can.
Just not expensive ones.

19:58.545 --> 20:00.242
Why not?

20:00.286 --> 20:04.203
Because I think it creates
certain expectations.

20:04.246 --> 20:06.422
I'm only 26, I'm just now

20:06.466 --> 20:08.468
beginning to figure out
who I am.

20:10.383 --> 20:13.951
I don't want my whole identity
to be just someone's girlfriend.

20:15.475 --> 20:17.564
-You know?
-Yeah, no. I...

20:19.740 --> 20:20.915
I get it.

20:22.569 --> 20:24.310
I'll just,
I'll just bring the Ferrari

20:24.353 --> 20:26.355
back to the dealership,
you know?

20:37.671 --> 20:41.457
Well, I'm sorry. It's just...

20:41.501 --> 20:44.852
We've been dating for a while,
you know, and I thought...

20:44.895 --> 20:46.636
Hey, no.

20:48.856 --> 20:52.729
Look, it's sweet. It's just...

20:52.773 --> 20:55.515
I know, we've only been dating
for a month, you know?

20:57.299 --> 21:00.041
Maybe just slow down a little...

21:00.911 --> 21:02.435
enjoy each other.

21:04.393 --> 21:05.612
Of course.

21:07.048 --> 21:08.441
Of course.

21:20.322 --> 21:23.282
[intense music]

21:30.941 --> 21:33.422
Scream and you're dead.
Understand?

21:33.466 --> 21:34.467
[muffled whimpering]

21:37.470 --> 21:40.037
[man 1] Quiet.
Tell me where it is.

21:42.518 --> 21:43.650
Where's the money?

21:45.652 --> 21:46.783
Quiet.

21:48.959 --> 21:50.918
Nick! Nick!

21:50.961 --> 21:52.963
[groaning]

21:53.834 --> 21:54.922
Nick!

21:57.664 --> 21:58.795
Nick, Nick!

21:59.840 --> 22:01.320
Nick, be careful.

22:01.363 --> 22:04.061
Oh, my God! Nick! Nick!

22:04.105 --> 22:06.934
-[man groaning]
-Nick, stop, stop, stop.

22:06.977 --> 22:08.022
Nick!

22:11.112 --> 22:13.375
Nick, Nick, stop! Stop it!

22:13.419 --> 22:15.769
Stop, you're gonna kill him.

22:15.812 --> 22:18.772
Nick, you're gonna kill him!
Oh, my God!

22:18.815 --> 22:21.470
Nick, stop! Stop.

22:21.514 --> 22:23.603
[sobbing] Oh, my God, Nick...

22:25.518 --> 22:26.867
[sobbing] Oh, my God...

22:31.393 --> 22:32.873
[Katie] No...

22:35.832 --> 22:37.051
Babe...

22:39.532 --> 22:41.534
-Are you okay?
-I'm fine.

22:44.101 --> 22:45.668
[mumbles]

22:45.712 --> 22:48.671
-Where's my phone?
-[Nick] What are you doing?

22:48.715 --> 22:50.543
-I'm dialing 9-1-1.
-Stop.

22:50.586 --> 22:52.022
-Why?
-Give me your phone.

22:53.676 --> 22:54.808
Babe...

22:54.851 --> 22:57.898
Nick, Nick, it was self-defense.

22:57.941 --> 23:01.597
-Anyone can see that.
-Get dressed. You should go.

23:01.641 --> 23:03.556
What... Wait,
what are you talking about?

23:03.599 --> 23:05.427
-We have to call the police!
-I can't have police here.

23:05.471 --> 23:06.820
It won't look good
to my employers.

23:06.863 --> 23:08.038
What employers?

23:08.082 --> 23:11.085
I don't have time for questions,
Katie!

23:11.128 --> 23:12.739
He tried to attack me, okay?

23:12.782 --> 23:16.090
He's-he's wearing a ski-mask,
for Christ's sake.

23:16.133 --> 23:17.874
The police
are not gonna blame you.

23:17.918 --> 23:19.789
-No police.
-Why not?

23:19.833 --> 23:21.443
Kate, if there's any suspicion,

23:21.487 --> 23:22.792
you're an accessory.
I'm trying to protect you.

23:22.836 --> 23:24.533
W-why can't we just
tell them the truth?

23:24.577 --> 23:26.579
'Cause I can't go back
to prison, okay?

23:35.457 --> 23:37.154
-Why were you in prison?
-Enough.

23:37.198 --> 23:40.114
Put your clothes on and get out!

23:43.073 --> 23:46.076
[intense music]

23:51.821 --> 23:53.040
Katie!

23:56.522 --> 23:59.612
Don't you tell a soul
about this. You hear me?

23:59.655 --> 24:02.571
Not your mother,
not your friend at the gallery

24:02.615 --> 24:04.921
and definitely not the police.

24:06.967 --> 24:08.098
Understood?

24:15.889 --> 24:18.544
[music continues]

24:19.153 --> 24:20.589
Hey.

24:21.590 --> 24:23.462
Hey.

24:23.505 --> 24:24.767
Everything okay?

24:24.811 --> 24:26.726
Yeah, yeah.

24:26.769 --> 24:28.771
-You looked upset.
-No, I'm, I'm good.

24:28.815 --> 24:30.556
-I'm good. Thank you.
-That's all right.

24:30.599 --> 24:32.775
-All right. Let's go.
-Yeah.

24:32.819 --> 24:35.169
Can you believe
he showed up to my work?

24:35.212 --> 24:36.170
No.

24:36.213 --> 24:37.127
Like, well, he thinks he's just

24:37.171 --> 24:38.781
gonna show up

24:38.825 --> 24:41.480
with his baby-blues,
and everything is just fine.

24:45.005 --> 24:46.180
Hm.

24:49.618 --> 24:50.793
Oh...

24:51.577 --> 24:52.839
Oh...

24:56.538 --> 24:58.497
[doorbell rings]

25:07.680 --> 25:08.811
Well, hey there.

25:08.855 --> 25:11.858
Nick, what are you doing here?

25:11.901 --> 25:14.861
I got the coffee you wanted,
Kenyan blend.

25:16.123 --> 25:18.038
Thank you.
It's very thoughtful.

25:19.692 --> 25:21.955
Aren't you gonna invite me in?

25:21.998 --> 25:23.652
Well, I'm a little busy
right now,

25:23.696 --> 25:26.525
but it was very sweet of you
to drop by.

25:26.568 --> 25:29.310
-I'll just stay a minute.
-Now is not a good time.

25:31.747 --> 25:34.663
I wanna continue
our conversation from earlier.

25:34.707 --> 25:36.099
It really got me thinking.

25:39.015 --> 25:43.019
Lovely home.
Just as I remember it.

25:43.063 --> 25:45.892
Hm. Changed the couch,
though, right?

25:47.197 --> 25:49.809
I got it reupholstered.

25:49.852 --> 25:50.897
Mm-hmm.

25:55.118 --> 25:57.947
Oh, look at that.

26:01.298 --> 26:03.039
So beautiful, isn't she?

26:05.215 --> 26:06.695
Yes, she was.

26:07.827 --> 26:09.176
Yeah, she was.

26:12.962 --> 26:14.877
I'm gonna have
to ask you to leave.

26:19.752 --> 26:21.144
[Nick] Who is this
little fellow?

26:22.668 --> 26:24.626
My godson.

26:24.670 --> 26:26.672
-Godson, huh?
-Yeah.

26:26.715 --> 26:29.892
My best friend from high school.
It's her grandson.

26:30.937 --> 26:32.678
Cute, isn't he?

26:34.114 --> 26:35.855
He really is.

26:37.247 --> 26:38.814
What's his name?

26:39.685 --> 26:42.078
-Danny.
-Danny.

26:42.122 --> 26:43.732
How old is he?

26:43.776 --> 26:44.907
What?

26:46.343 --> 26:47.736
How old?

26:47.780 --> 26:51.610
Around eight, I think.

26:51.653 --> 26:54.003
He looks just like me
when I was that age.

26:55.135 --> 26:56.615
Hm.

26:56.658 --> 26:58.225
Really? That's funny.

26:58.268 --> 27:01.707
Yeah, almost exactly,
it's uncanny.

27:04.274 --> 27:06.712
Well, if you're gonna stay,

27:06.755 --> 27:09.323
why don't I make us some coffee?

27:12.152 --> 27:15.111
-Where is he?
-Who?

27:15.155 --> 27:17.113
-My son.
-What are you talking about?

27:17.157 --> 27:19.638
-Where is my son?
-I don't know what you mean.

27:19.681 --> 27:21.944
Don't. Do not play with me,
Evelyn!

27:21.988 --> 27:25.905
-You won't win.
-No. I don't know what you mean!

27:25.948 --> 27:27.820
-Last chance.
-I don't know...

27:34.174 --> 27:36.698
I don't know where they are.

27:36.742 --> 27:39.962
Some town up north.
She won't tell me.

27:40.006 --> 27:42.051
Where's the envelope
this photo came in?

27:48.231 --> 27:49.755
Thanks, Evelyn.

27:53.019 --> 27:54.673
[door opens]

27:54.716 --> 27:57.110
[intense music]

28:00.287 --> 28:01.723
Hey, can I help you?

28:01.767 --> 28:04.421
Yeah, I got a, uh,
to-go order. Lucas.

28:04.465 --> 28:05.901
[Chloe] Yeah, uh,
just give me a second.

28:05.945 --> 28:07.773
-[Lucas] Yeah.
-Hey, Anna.

28:07.816 --> 28:09.165
Do you have a to-go order
for Lucas?

28:09.209 --> 28:10.253
Got it.

28:11.385 --> 28:14.344
-Hi.
-Hey.

28:14.388 --> 28:16.695
I thought I scared you off
the other day.

28:16.738 --> 28:17.696
No.

28:19.045 --> 28:20.437
Yeah, maybe a little bit.

28:22.788 --> 28:24.354
Hey, do you like bowling?

28:24.398 --> 28:27.227
Yeah. Yeah.
Who doesn't like bowling?

28:28.402 --> 28:30.317
Wanna go sometime?

28:30.360 --> 28:32.319
Yeah, how about tonight?

28:32.362 --> 28:35.714
Oh, um, I'm sorry,
tonight won't work.

28:35.757 --> 28:37.716
My son, I-I don't have a sitter.

28:37.759 --> 28:39.239
But, um, maybe--

28:39.282 --> 28:40.457
I can babysit.

28:41.807 --> 28:44.157
There you go. She can babysit.

28:45.245 --> 28:47.029
So, how about eight o'clock?

28:47.073 --> 28:49.945
-Yeah, eight o'clock is good.
-He wasn't asking you.

28:51.947 --> 28:53.732
Um, how about
you just give me your number?

28:53.775 --> 28:55.081
-I'll give you a call.
-Sure.

28:59.172 --> 29:01.130
Cool. See you tonight?

29:01.174 --> 29:02.915
-Yeah. See you later.
-All right.

29:02.958 --> 29:04.264
-Bye.
-Thanks.

29:08.834 --> 29:11.401
-Hey...
-[chuckling]

29:11.445 --> 29:13.142
Very funny.

29:13.186 --> 29:14.187
Listen,
I'm gonna get out of here.

29:14.230 --> 29:15.928
Is that cool with you?

29:15.971 --> 29:17.494
And you'll get pretty
for your date?

29:17.538 --> 29:19.758
[chuckles] I'm going to pick up
Danny.

29:21.455 --> 29:22.935
You're welcome.

29:29.419 --> 29:31.813
[cell phone ringing]

29:33.249 --> 29:35.121
-[Katie] Mom?
-You were right, Katie.

29:35.164 --> 29:37.993
I underestimated him.

29:38.037 --> 29:41.083
-What happened?
-[Evelyn] He was here.

29:41.127 --> 29:43.912
-Where?
-In my house.

29:43.956 --> 29:47.046
He knows about Danny.
He saw a picture on my fridge.

29:47.089 --> 29:49.309
-Katie.
-I'm here.

29:52.051 --> 29:54.009
I'm so sorry.

29:54.053 --> 29:55.402
It's fine, I...

29:55.445 --> 29:58.318
I knew this would happen
at some point.

29:58.361 --> 30:00.102
Does he know where I live?

30:00.146 --> 30:01.843
He took the envelope you sent.

30:01.887 --> 30:04.324
So he knows the general area.

30:04.367 --> 30:08.110
-What are you gonna do?
-I don't know.

30:08.154 --> 30:10.852
-Maybe I'll move again.
-You can't do that.

30:10.896 --> 30:12.419
Danny just started school.

30:12.462 --> 30:14.943
-Did he hurt you?
-No. I'm fine.

30:14.987 --> 30:17.119
He just scared me.

30:17.163 --> 30:20.949
Katie, how much longer
can you keep running?

30:20.993 --> 30:22.429
As long as I have to.

30:28.174 --> 30:30.916
Why aren't you
returning my calls?

30:30.959 --> 30:32.831
-I don't wanna speak to you.
-Did you go to the police?

30:32.874 --> 30:36.399
No. Did you get rid of the body?

30:36.443 --> 30:39.141
Look, I'm sorry you got mixed up
in my business,

30:39.185 --> 30:40.839
but at least
now you know the truth.

30:40.882 --> 30:42.884
What is the truth, Nick?

30:42.928 --> 30:43.929
What are you,
some kind of gangster?

30:43.972 --> 30:45.321
Hey, I told you.

30:45.365 --> 30:47.280
I make loans
for some very powerful people

30:47.323 --> 30:50.065
who depend on my efficiency
and discretion.

30:50.109 --> 30:52.198
You lied to me about everything.

30:53.895 --> 30:55.114
I don't trust you.

30:56.419 --> 30:59.466
I know you, Katie.
You don't mean that.

31:01.337 --> 31:02.338
No, no, I'm sorry,

31:02.382 --> 31:05.037
this, this isn't gonna work.

31:05.080 --> 31:07.169
I don't think we should
see each other again.

31:07.213 --> 31:11.173
I can't lose you.
Baby, you are everything to me.

31:11.217 --> 31:12.392
Not anymore.

31:14.046 --> 31:16.526
-I decide when this is over.
-Let go of my arm!

31:16.570 --> 31:18.877
-Don't test me, Katie.
-Don't threaten me.

31:18.920 --> 31:20.182
You know what,
I will go to the police.

31:20.226 --> 31:21.444
I wouldn't do that
if I were you.

31:21.488 --> 31:23.403
Because I will destroy
everything,

31:23.446 --> 31:26.449
everything you love.

31:26.493 --> 31:29.191
-I don't believe you.
-Yeah? No?

31:29.235 --> 31:31.585
I don't make empty threats.
Believe that.

31:33.543 --> 31:34.893
Let go of my arm,
you're hurting me!

31:34.936 --> 31:37.025
I'm sorry.

31:37.069 --> 31:40.942
I won't hurt you, baby.
I love you.

31:40.986 --> 31:44.032
You're out of your mind,
you know that?

31:44.076 --> 31:47.166
-This isn't love.
-Where are you going?

31:47.209 --> 31:49.385
You'll never get away from me,
Katie, never.

31:49.429 --> 31:52.127
Do you hear me? You will never
get away from me!

31:52.171 --> 31:55.261
I will find you wherever you go!
I will find you!

31:57.132 --> 31:59.091
-[door thuds]
-[gasps]

31:59.134 --> 32:02.007
So remember I was telling you
about dodgeball

32:02.050 --> 32:04.139
and everyone ganged up on me?

32:04.183 --> 32:06.489
Well, today
I was the last one standing.

32:06.533 --> 32:09.144
I was, like,
the king of dodgeball.

32:10.276 --> 32:11.407
Mom?

32:12.408 --> 32:14.019
Oh, I'm sorry, sweetie, I...

32:14.062 --> 32:15.934
I have a lot on my mind, okay?

32:15.977 --> 32:18.588
-Did something happen?
-No, no, I just...

32:18.632 --> 32:20.939
I got into a small disagreement
with your grandmother.

32:20.982 --> 32:22.941
-That's all.
-[Danny] Oh.

32:24.029 --> 32:25.073
I wish I could meet her.

32:25.117 --> 32:26.335
[mellow music]

32:26.379 --> 32:28.120
You will, someday.

32:29.643 --> 32:31.166
It's a promise.

32:33.647 --> 32:37.303
Hey, Danny, what would you say
about us moving somewhere new?

32:37.346 --> 32:39.958
But I just started school.

32:40.001 --> 32:41.307
I know.

32:42.656 --> 32:45.093
[sighs] Why do you wanna move?

32:45.137 --> 32:48.357
Uh, I, um, I got a new job offer
in another city.

32:48.401 --> 32:50.316
What kind of job?

32:50.359 --> 32:52.579
Uh, an office job.

32:52.622 --> 32:56.017
-Is that better?
-Well, it's more money.

32:56.061 --> 32:58.585
But... why?

32:58.628 --> 33:01.414
Uh, I don't wanna move!
It's not fair!

33:01.457 --> 33:05.113
Okay, okay, calm down.
I was just asking.

33:05.157 --> 33:06.593
You don't have to get all crazy.

33:06.636 --> 33:09.726
Well, you make me crazy.

33:09.770 --> 33:11.163
[clicks tongue]

33:20.563 --> 33:23.610
Danny, what's the matter? What,
are you not talking to me now?

33:23.653 --> 33:26.004
Why don't you wash your hands,
okay? Dinner's gonna get cold.

33:26.047 --> 33:28.180
-I'm not hungry.
-Danny.

33:31.531 --> 33:33.663
Hello!

33:35.535 --> 33:37.058
Lucas. [sighs]

33:37.102 --> 33:39.104
Where's the little guy?

33:39.147 --> 33:41.671
I brought flour and all
the stuff to make cookies.

33:41.715 --> 33:44.326
Bet it'd be fun for Danny
since his mama never cooks.

33:44.370 --> 33:47.068
[sighs] Yeah.

33:47.112 --> 33:49.505
Aren't you gonna change
for your date?

33:49.549 --> 33:52.726
-I'm sorry. I'm not going.
-What are you talking about?

33:52.769 --> 33:55.163
I'm sorry. I'm not in the mood
to go on a date.

33:55.207 --> 33:57.774
I should have called you.
I-I apologize.

33:57.818 --> 33:59.341
What are you doing?

33:59.385 --> 34:01.691
-Making an excuse.
-No, you're not.

34:01.735 --> 34:03.084
Can you give me back my phone,
please?

34:03.128 --> 34:04.477
No, you're being totally rude.

34:04.520 --> 34:06.044
Chloe, this is really
none of your business.

34:06.087 --> 34:07.480
Yeah, it is my business.

34:07.523 --> 34:11.049
I helped you set up the date,
and... [sighs]

34:11.092 --> 34:14.094
And I'm your friend and I don't
want to see you self-sabotage.

34:16.141 --> 34:17.751
Look, you don't understand.

34:23.148 --> 34:24.757
Then explain it to me.

34:32.418 --> 34:36.291
I was in a really bad
relationship a few years ago.

34:37.553 --> 34:40.252
-Danny's father?
-Yeah.

34:40.295 --> 34:42.514
He was abusive.

34:42.558 --> 34:44.125
It was really bad and...

34:46.606 --> 34:50.088
And now he's resurfaced
and he is harassing my mom...

34:51.610 --> 34:53.656
God, it's a nightmare.

34:53.699 --> 34:56.224
Is that why you moved here?

34:56.268 --> 34:57.704
To escape this guy?

34:57.747 --> 34:59.836
-[instrumental music]
-Yes.

35:04.189 --> 35:06.800
Okay. I get it.

35:06.843 --> 35:10.760
Yeah, there's a lot of,
lot of bad guys out there...

35:10.804 --> 35:13.241
but I don't think
that Lucas is one of them.

35:15.287 --> 35:17.419
He seems like a good guy.

35:17.463 --> 35:20.509
And I think that we should
reward the good ones, don't you?

35:22.337 --> 35:23.904
Do the right thing.

35:25.732 --> 35:28.169
You know you want to.

35:29.475 --> 35:30.650
[skittles rattling]

35:32.304 --> 35:34.132
[Lucas] Um, I can't believe
you beat me twice, I--

35:34.175 --> 35:35.698
-I killed you.
-It's embarrassing.

35:35.742 --> 35:37.309
-I mean--
-I know people here.

35:37.352 --> 35:39.615
-You know, Danny likes to bowl.
-Hm.

35:39.659 --> 35:41.530
-So I get a lot of practice.
-Hm.

35:41.574 --> 35:43.793
-[chuckles]
-I bet.

35:43.837 --> 35:46.361
-So how'd you guys end up here?
-[clears throat]

35:47.710 --> 35:49.408
I don't know, we...

35:49.451 --> 35:51.671
We needed a change, you know?

35:53.499 --> 35:55.196
-What about you?
-[Lucas chuckles]

35:55.240 --> 35:58.199
-You do that a lot.
-What?

35:58.243 --> 36:00.158
You give a vague answer to me

36:00.201 --> 36:02.160
and then bounce the question
right back at me.

36:02.203 --> 36:04.162
-It's kind of your thing.
-Okay.

36:04.205 --> 36:06.207
Sorry. [laughs]
I guess I do do that.

36:06.251 --> 36:08.818
[laughs] Um...

36:08.862 --> 36:12.431
I haven't been on a date
in a while, so...

36:12.474 --> 36:15.651
It's okay.
Yeah. I'm rusty, too.

36:15.695 --> 36:16.957
[chuckles]

36:18.698 --> 36:21.527
I'll go first, uh...

36:21.570 --> 36:24.356
I grew up in this sleepy town.

36:24.399 --> 36:27.359
And I moved to Brooklyn
and opened up a store.

36:27.402 --> 36:30.231
-What kind of store?
-Uh, watch repair.

36:31.406 --> 36:33.191
-[Katie] Oh, wow.
-Yeah.

36:33.756 --> 36:36.237
It's beautiful.

36:36.281 --> 36:38.848
Well, it's really nice,
it's like, it's like art deco.

36:38.892 --> 36:41.329
-Yeah.
-That style.

36:41.373 --> 36:42.635
No one's ever gotten that
before.

36:42.678 --> 36:45.290
-I like it. Nice.
-Yeah. Thank you.

36:46.552 --> 36:49.685
-Did you like Brooklyn?
-I don't know.

36:49.729 --> 36:52.906
Honestly, uh,
everyone there is, like,

36:52.949 --> 36:57.345
tryin' to be so authentic,
it just feels inauthentic.

36:57.389 --> 36:59.739
Yeah. Yeah.
No, I know what you mean.

37:03.917 --> 37:07.312
Are you in touch
with Danny's father at all?

37:07.355 --> 37:08.922
-You all talk?
-No.

37:10.358 --> 37:12.926
No. What about you?
You want kids?

37:14.406 --> 37:16.234
You're doin' it again.

37:16.277 --> 37:18.366
-What?
-Deflecting.

37:19.324 --> 37:20.455
You're right.

37:22.588 --> 37:26.418
Listen, I don't wanna talk
about Danny's father.

37:27.375 --> 37:28.811
Is that okay?

37:28.855 --> 37:30.248
Of course.

37:31.814 --> 37:34.904
And, yes. I do wanna have kids.

37:34.948 --> 37:37.864
But I don't know
if I'm ready yet.

37:37.907 --> 37:40.388
You're never ready, you know?

37:40.432 --> 37:42.303
It just happens.

37:45.306 --> 37:47.874
I did have a girlfriend
in Brooklyn.

37:47.917 --> 37:49.310
Oh?

37:49.354 --> 37:50.877
-She was a dancer.
-Oh.

37:50.920 --> 37:52.966
Gorgeous, talented, smart.

37:53.009 --> 37:54.794
We were practically
living together.

37:54.837 --> 37:56.448
Uh-huh.

37:56.491 --> 37:59.929
But I had two roommates,
so it was, it was tricky.

38:00.887 --> 38:04.543
And, uh, she got pregnant.

38:04.586 --> 38:08.373
And... everything changed.

38:08.416 --> 38:09.983
I mean, suddenly I, you know,
I couldn't just live

38:10.026 --> 38:12.420
in the moment, I was thinking
about the next 18 years.

38:12.464 --> 38:13.682
I was thinking about
being a dad--

38:13.726 --> 38:15.467
And she had the baby?

38:17.860 --> 38:19.384
Yeah, she did.

38:23.518 --> 38:25.041
You left her?

38:27.000 --> 38:28.436
I did.

38:31.091 --> 38:33.006
Missed this town, I guess.

38:36.575 --> 38:37.967
What about your kid?

38:40.666 --> 38:43.016
It wasn't my kid.

38:43.059 --> 38:45.932
-What?
-It was my roommate's.

38:45.975 --> 38:47.368
[gasps]

38:48.848 --> 38:51.720
-I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
-Yeah.

38:51.764 --> 38:53.505
They would hook up
while I was asleep.

38:53.548 --> 38:55.463
Oh...

38:55.507 --> 38:57.465
[inhales sharply] That's rough.

38:57.509 --> 38:58.988
-I'm-I'm sorry.
-Yeah.

38:59.032 --> 39:00.990
Yeah, it was pretty humiliating.

39:01.034 --> 39:03.384
-Uh...
-Wow.

39:03.428 --> 39:05.952
But it was also a bit of relief,
you know?

39:05.995 --> 39:08.041
Hm.

39:08.084 --> 39:10.652
Can I make an observation
about you?

39:10.696 --> 39:11.740
Sure.

39:11.784 --> 39:14.047
You are way too sophisticated

39:14.090 --> 39:15.831
to be working as a waitress.

39:15.875 --> 39:18.399
-[laughs] No, I'm not.
-Yeah.

39:18.443 --> 39:21.010
Look, I don't mind it, you know?

39:21.054 --> 39:22.925
I mean, it's a job.

39:22.969 --> 39:24.971
It's not like I'm independently
wealthy or anything.

39:27.452 --> 39:29.671
What if you were?

39:29.715 --> 39:32.413
I mean,
if you could do anything,

39:32.457 --> 39:34.415
what would you do?

39:34.459 --> 39:36.983
I don't know, maybe I'd be...

39:37.026 --> 39:40.421
curator at an art museum.

39:40.465 --> 39:43.990
Or, um,
I'd own my own gallery.

39:44.033 --> 39:46.427
-Wow.
-Yeah.

39:46.471 --> 39:49.387
-Those sound like city jobs.
-I guess.

39:50.779 --> 39:53.826
-[Lucas] So I'll ask you again.
-Mm-hmm?

39:53.869 --> 39:56.872
What are you doing
in this part of the town?

39:56.916 --> 39:58.570
Beating your country ass
at bowling.

39:58.613 --> 40:01.181
That's what. [laughs]

40:02.443 --> 40:05.533
You know what? One more game.

40:05.577 --> 40:06.708
-Oh, yeah?
-Put your shoes back on.

40:06.752 --> 40:08.536
-One more game.
-Okay.

40:08.580 --> 40:10.538
One more chance to redeem
yourself. How about that?

40:10.582 --> 40:11.974
-That's all I need.
-One more chance.

40:12.018 --> 40:13.411
This is my home turf, right?

40:13.454 --> 40:15.500
-I got to defend it.
-[laughing]

40:17.153 --> 40:19.417
[indistinct song on car stereo]

40:19.460 --> 40:20.809
So you always wait
till the third game

40:20.853 --> 40:22.811
to, like,
pull out all the stops?

40:22.855 --> 40:23.943
-That's right.
-To impress the ladies?

40:23.986 --> 40:25.074
That's why I turned it on.

40:25.118 --> 40:26.728
-Is that, is that right?
-Yeah.

40:26.772 --> 40:28.513
You're gonna kick my ass
at putt-putt next time?

40:28.556 --> 40:31.559
[laughs] I might.

40:31.603 --> 40:33.169
They used to call me
the putt-putt queen.

40:33.213 --> 40:34.475
Oh, really?

40:38.653 --> 40:40.438
You've a really nice smile.

40:40.960 --> 40:42.483
Thank you.

40:47.140 --> 40:50.143
[instrumental music]

41:00.501 --> 41:01.720
[Katie chuckles]

41:01.763 --> 41:02.982
[indistinct chatter]

41:04.157 --> 41:05.941
I used to be a master. Tsk.

41:05.985 --> 41:07.116
-Then make out...
-Oh, yeah?

41:07.160 --> 41:08.030
...after the bowling.

41:08.074 --> 41:09.510
Mm-hmm, at the, uh...

41:09.554 --> 41:10.816
-And the unbutton, and the...
-Yeah.

41:10.859 --> 41:13.732
[laughs] On the first kiss?

41:13.775 --> 41:17.170
Maybe we should just save that
for another time. Hm?

41:17.213 --> 41:19.651
There gonna be another time?

41:19.694 --> 41:20.956
-There might be.
-Maybe...

41:21.000 --> 41:22.610
-If you play your cards right.
-Oh.

41:22.654 --> 41:24.090
If I'm still in town.

41:24.133 --> 41:26.135
You planning on leaving town?

41:26.179 --> 41:28.137
I'd like
to keep my options open.

41:29.965 --> 41:31.967
-You are an enigma.
-[chuckles]

41:33.621 --> 41:35.057
Just private.

41:36.711 --> 41:38.191
Wanna go back to my house?

41:39.192 --> 41:40.976
We don't have to do anything.

41:41.020 --> 41:42.978
Well, as long as
you have a cute roommate,

41:43.022 --> 41:44.850
I'm totally down.

41:44.893 --> 41:46.547
-[chuckles]
-I...

41:46.591 --> 41:49.724
-Too soon?
-Yeah. Too soon.

41:49.768 --> 41:52.074
[exhales] No, listen,
I would love to hang out more,

41:52.118 --> 41:55.034
I just...
I should get going, you know?

41:55.077 --> 41:57.515
I, uh, left Danny with Chloe,
so...

41:57.558 --> 42:00.561
-You don't trust her?
-No, she's great.

42:00.605 --> 42:02.781
I just... I worry.

42:04.565 --> 42:05.697
Okay.

42:06.654 --> 42:07.699
Well, one more.

42:09.222 --> 42:11.572
-[Katie] One more?
-Yeah, maybe two more.

42:11.616 --> 42:14.619
[music continues]

42:19.754 --> 42:21.756
[Chloe] You need to go to bed,
little man.

42:21.800 --> 42:24.193
Your mom would kill me if she
knew that you were still up.

42:24.237 --> 42:26.065
I think I ate too many cookies.

42:26.108 --> 42:28.023
Ugh, me, too.

42:29.634 --> 42:31.897
Hey, do you know my dad?

42:33.725 --> 42:35.683
No.

42:35.727 --> 42:37.990
Your mom doesn't like
to talk about him very much.

42:38.033 --> 42:40.906
And I assure you
there's a good reason for that.

42:40.949 --> 42:44.910
Well, he is my dad.
I'd like to meet him.

42:44.953 --> 42:49.044
You are lucky you have a mom
who loves you so much.

42:49.088 --> 42:51.003
[dramatic music]

42:51.046 --> 42:53.614
I didn't meet my dad
until I was a teenager.

42:53.658 --> 42:56.791
And trust me,
I was not missing much.

42:59.054 --> 43:00.621
What's wrong?

43:00.665 --> 43:02.057
There's a man out there.

43:03.798 --> 43:04.799
[Chloe] Where?

43:04.843 --> 43:05.974
There-there was a man

43:06.018 --> 43:07.846
looking into the window.

43:07.889 --> 43:10.152
[knocking on door]

43:10.196 --> 43:11.937
-Who is that?
-Danny, uh...

43:11.980 --> 43:13.591
-Why don't you go to your room?
-But--

43:13.634 --> 43:15.897
Danny. Just do it.

43:16.681 --> 43:17.899
[Danny groans]

43:19.292 --> 43:20.772
[knocking on door]

43:25.777 --> 43:28.040
[banging on door]

43:30.172 --> 43:33.175
[intense music]

43:37.266 --> 43:39.791
[banging on door]

43:43.751 --> 43:45.318
[banging on door]

43:57.286 --> 43:58.940
Who is it?

43:58.984 --> 44:00.289
[Leon] It's me.

44:01.726 --> 44:03.641
What the...
You're stalking me now?

44:03.684 --> 44:04.946
You don't return
my phone calls.

44:04.990 --> 44:07.079
I don't wanna talk to you, duh!

44:07.122 --> 44:09.777
-Why are you holding a knife?
-You scared the crap out of me.

44:09.821 --> 44:10.996
Sorry.

44:12.954 --> 44:15.304
Can we just talk for a minute?

44:15.348 --> 44:18.177
No. You shouldn't be here.

44:18.220 --> 44:19.961
Okay. I admit it.

44:20.005 --> 44:21.963
I, I flirt with other women.

44:23.878 --> 44:25.271
Okay...

44:26.751 --> 44:27.969
Why?

44:29.144 --> 44:30.972
Because it feels good.

44:32.844 --> 44:34.280
And how do you think
that makes me feel?

44:34.323 --> 44:35.890
I know it's wrong, but it ain't

44:35.934 --> 44:37.805
like I'm gonna go
do anything with them.

44:37.849 --> 44:39.198
Yeah, but you're my boyfriend,
you shouldn't even

44:39.241 --> 44:40.678
be thinking about other women.

44:40.721 --> 44:42.984
I'm not! Well, not s-seriously.

44:43.028 --> 44:44.333
You're the only woman I want.

44:44.377 --> 44:47.075
I mean, I'm not out there
stalking them.

44:47.119 --> 44:48.468
Am I?

44:52.254 --> 44:53.734
Oh.

44:53.778 --> 44:57.085
That is strangely logical.

44:57.129 --> 44:58.696
Do you miss me?

45:00.045 --> 45:02.874
-Admit it.
-I'm still holding a knife.

45:04.049 --> 45:06.399
-You need to leave.
-Call me.

45:17.062 --> 45:18.367
[owl hooting]

45:18.411 --> 45:20.413
[humming]

45:22.067 --> 45:23.024
[both gasping]

45:23.068 --> 45:24.722
Are you okay? I'm sorry.

45:24.765 --> 45:26.201
[laughing] I'm sorry.

45:27.072 --> 45:28.203
So?

45:28.247 --> 45:30.728
[sighs] It was fun.

45:30.771 --> 45:33.992
[chuckles]
He's a good guy.

45:34.035 --> 45:35.254
Did you kiss him?

45:36.081 --> 45:37.822
[chuckles] Come on.

45:37.865 --> 45:39.824
You like him.

45:39.867 --> 45:41.739
Look how flushed you are.

45:41.782 --> 45:43.784
I just, I don't know
if it's the right time

45:43.828 --> 45:45.177
for a relationship.

45:47.135 --> 45:49.747
-How's Danny?
-Good.

45:49.790 --> 45:51.444
We had a visitor.

45:52.358 --> 45:54.229
-Leon.
-Oh.

45:54.273 --> 45:56.492
I'll tell you about it later.

45:56.536 --> 45:58.451
Danny asked about his father,
though.

45:59.800 --> 46:01.802
Yeah.

46:01.846 --> 46:04.805
Yeah, I'm gonna have to tell him
the truth at some point.

46:04.849 --> 46:08.896
Yeah. Sooner rather than later.
He's a bright kid.

46:08.940 --> 46:11.464
Not much gets past him.

46:11.507 --> 46:12.944
All right,
I'm gonna leave you this mess.

46:12.987 --> 46:15.033
-Okay. Thank you so much.
-You're welcome.

46:15.076 --> 46:16.948
-Goodnight. Mwah.
-You're the best.

46:16.991 --> 46:18.906
-All right, bye!
-Have a nice night. Bye.

46:23.171 --> 46:26.174
[instrumental music]

46:56.117 --> 46:59.120
[music continues]

47:22.230 --> 47:24.972
Hey. What's wrong?

47:29.194 --> 47:30.543
I'm pregnant.

47:32.414 --> 47:33.938
It sucks.

47:37.332 --> 47:40.161
Now what am I gonna do? I...

47:40.205 --> 47:43.121
You know, I-I feel so trapped.

47:43.164 --> 47:45.863
He's never gonna
let me go now. No.

47:47.342 --> 47:49.344
You don't have to keep it.

47:49.388 --> 47:50.606
I know.

47:51.477 --> 47:53.522
I know, I...

47:53.566 --> 47:55.220
I mean, I want to...

47:56.612 --> 47:59.528
You know, I want to protect it.

47:59.572 --> 48:01.487
He's going to find out, Katie.

48:01.530 --> 48:03.445
[dramatic music]

48:04.620 --> 48:06.884
I mean, my life is over.

48:06.927 --> 48:09.408
-What am I gonna do?
-No, don't say that.

48:09.451 --> 48:12.237
I wish I could just disappear,
you know?

48:12.280 --> 48:14.500
-How?
-I don't know, I...

48:14.543 --> 48:16.197
I just feel like
my life would be so much easier

48:16.241 --> 48:18.025
if I was someone else.

48:20.245 --> 48:22.638
Can I tell you something
in confidence?

48:29.994 --> 48:33.040
Do you know how Sergey managed
to defect from Russia?

48:34.346 --> 48:36.000
How?

48:36.043 --> 48:38.959
He forged his own documents.

48:39.003 --> 48:42.310
A passport and a work visa.

48:42.354 --> 48:44.356
Otherwise he would have
never gotten out.

48:46.140 --> 48:48.621
[man] Name?

48:48.664 --> 48:50.318
What... I'm sorry, what?
What'd you say?

48:50.362 --> 48:53.408
-What name are you using?
-Um, um...

48:53.452 --> 48:57.369
Oh, shit, I haven't thought
about that, um...

48:57.412 --> 49:00.502
-I guess something simple--
-I need it, now.

49:00.546 --> 49:02.504
Okay, um...

49:02.548 --> 49:03.984
Anna.

49:04.593 --> 49:07.118
Anna... Jones.

49:08.989 --> 49:10.948
That should be it.

49:10.991 --> 49:13.951
[dramatic music]

49:32.012 --> 49:34.972
[dramatic music]

49:40.586 --> 49:42.109
Hi, guys.
How's everything over here?

49:42.153 --> 49:43.328
Good.

49:48.507 --> 49:51.510
[music continues]

49:57.516 --> 49:59.300
[woman] Did you hear me?

49:59.344 --> 50:00.432
Miss?

50:01.302 --> 50:03.261
I-I'm sorry. What?

50:03.304 --> 50:06.438
-We're ready to order.
-Uh, of course, yes.

50:06.481 --> 50:08.005
-What can I get for you?
-Um...

50:08.048 --> 50:10.050
I would like a glass of wine.

50:10.094 --> 50:12.009
Uh, red or white?

50:12.052 --> 50:14.272
-How about rosÃ©?
-RosÃ©. Excellent.

50:22.323 --> 50:24.325
What, are you still angry
with me?

50:24.369 --> 50:26.023
Are we moving away?

50:27.285 --> 50:28.547
[sighs] I don't know yet.

50:28.590 --> 50:31.593
[dramatic music]

50:34.205 --> 50:36.250
What do you keep looking at?

50:36.294 --> 50:38.035
Nothing, I just...

50:39.688 --> 50:42.169
I-I keep thinking
I'm seeing the same car.

50:54.790 --> 50:56.575
Goodnight, mom.

51:08.282 --> 51:11.285
[dramatic music]

51:27.258 --> 51:28.520
You guys back together?

51:28.563 --> 51:30.522
We'll see.

51:30.565 --> 51:31.827
He's making dinner
for me and Kayla tonight.

51:31.871 --> 51:35.092
Oh. That's nice.
She's with him this week?

51:35.135 --> 51:36.571
Wait, what time is it?

51:36.615 --> 51:39.835
Oh, I gotta go pick up Danny.
Um...

51:39.879 --> 51:42.142
Sorry. Do you mind finishing up
for me?

51:42.186 --> 51:43.752
Yeah.

51:43.796 --> 51:46.320
-You owe me.
-Thank you.

51:54.154 --> 51:56.200
Oh, come on.

52:00.813 --> 52:03.816
[dramatic music]

52:10.301 --> 52:12.738
[line ringing]

52:14.696 --> 52:16.307
[James on voicemail]
You've reached James Madison

52:16.350 --> 52:19.179
Elementary, if this is
an emergency,

52:19.223 --> 52:22.443
please hang up and dial 9-1-1.

52:22.487 --> 52:25.794
We are either out of the office or busy on another call.

52:25.838 --> 52:28.623
Please leave a message
and we will get back to you

52:28.667 --> 52:30.712
as soon as possible.

52:30.756 --> 52:33.454
Hi, um, hello,
this is Anna. Anna Jones.

52:33.498 --> 52:35.717
I'm-I'm Danny's mother.
Um, listen.

52:35.761 --> 52:38.851
I am running a few minutes late,
but, um... [sighs]

52:38.894 --> 52:41.897
if you could just make sure that
someone keeps an eye on Danny,

52:41.941 --> 52:43.899
uh, okay? It's very important
that he's not left alone.

52:43.943 --> 52:47.381
Please. I will be there
very soon. Thank you.

52:47.425 --> 52:48.513
[cell phone beeps]

52:51.516 --> 52:54.519
[traffic bustling]

53:01.569 --> 53:05.182
Danny.
Mom's runnin' late. Hop in.

53:05.747 --> 53:07.271
Who are you?

53:08.924 --> 53:10.622
You don't recognize me?

53:12.406 --> 53:13.668
I'm your father.

53:13.712 --> 53:16.715
[dramatic music]

53:19.892 --> 53:21.676
[indistinct chatter]

53:21.720 --> 53:23.200
-No.
-Well, okay.

53:23.243 --> 53:25.767
-[spanner clattering]
-What's going on?

53:25.811 --> 53:27.856
[exhales]
Someone slashed my tire.

53:27.900 --> 53:30.294
[Chloe] What kind of jerk
would do that?

53:32.426 --> 53:34.341
You think he's here?

53:34.385 --> 53:36.648
-Who?
-None of your business.

53:36.691 --> 53:39.477
I got to get to Danny
before he does.

53:39.520 --> 53:42.349
-Let me do it.
-No, no. I-I got it.

53:42.393 --> 53:44.482
No, really, let him.
He's a machine.

53:49.443 --> 53:50.792
[crow cawing]

53:52.620 --> 53:55.797
My mom doesn't like me
eating fast food.

53:55.841 --> 53:57.625
Uh-huh?

53:57.669 --> 53:59.671
Good thing I'm not your mom.

54:04.415 --> 54:06.721
Does she know you're here?

54:06.765 --> 54:08.941
No. I wanted to surprise her.

54:12.510 --> 54:14.294
She doesn't like surprises.

54:14.338 --> 54:17.689
She once told me if anyone ever
tries to have a surprise party,

54:17.732 --> 54:20.257
I should tell her immediately.

54:20.300 --> 54:21.649
All right.

54:21.693 --> 54:24.652
Well, I think
she'll like this one.

54:24.696 --> 54:28.395
So, what's your mom told you
about me?

54:28.439 --> 54:30.571
She said
that you were in the military

54:30.615 --> 54:31.920
on a secret mission.

54:31.964 --> 54:33.400
Is that true?

54:35.315 --> 54:37.012
Yup. I just got back.

54:38.623 --> 54:40.625
How come you never call us?

54:42.017 --> 54:43.715
We're not allowed to, pal.

54:43.758 --> 54:46.674
Like your mom said,
secret mission.

54:46.718 --> 54:48.372
Do you think about me?

54:50.374 --> 54:51.462
Hey...

54:52.941 --> 54:54.378
Every day.

54:56.510 --> 54:58.730
Where d...
Where did you get that?

54:58.773 --> 55:00.471
Your mom sent it.

55:01.472 --> 55:04.475
[dramatic music]

55:15.399 --> 55:16.617
Danny?

55:19.359 --> 55:21.361
Danny?

55:21.405 --> 55:23.363
Danny? Hi, hi.
Have you guys seen Danny?

55:23.407 --> 55:24.712
Do you know Danny? No?

55:24.756 --> 55:26.888
Danny! Danny!

55:28.760 --> 55:30.065
[grunts] Come on!

55:30.109 --> 55:31.545
Danny!

55:35.375 --> 55:37.334
[grunts]

55:37.377 --> 55:38.900
Damn it! [grunts]

55:38.944 --> 55:41.076
[sobbing]

55:44.819 --> 55:45.951
[mumbles]

56:02.054 --> 56:03.490
Come on, pal.

56:04.839 --> 56:08.365
Hi! Room for the night, please.

56:08.408 --> 56:09.931
Seventy-nine dollars.

56:09.975 --> 56:12.412
-We're spending the night?
-Yeah.

56:12.456 --> 56:14.849
-It'd be fun, pal.
-Who's this little fella?

56:14.893 --> 56:17.548
-I'm Danny.
-He's my son.

56:19.419 --> 56:20.986
Where's your mama, Danny?

56:21.029 --> 56:24.076
She's at home, I think...

56:24.119 --> 56:26.687
-What's she doing at home?
-[Nick] Hey. You mind?

56:26.731 --> 56:29.690
I've been driving all day,
I really want to lie down.

56:29.734 --> 56:31.953
You want a cot for Danny?

56:31.997 --> 56:34.042
[Nick] Do you have double beds?

56:34.086 --> 56:35.914
[Maggie] Twenty dollars extra.

56:37.568 --> 56:39.439
And I'll need to see some ID.

56:39.483 --> 56:42.703
[laughs] Unreal.
Okay, have a good look.

56:42.747 --> 56:43.965
There you go.

56:46.707 --> 56:49.493
What do you think, huh?
Could we hurry this along maybe?

56:52.452 --> 56:55.629
Will you be requiring
extra towels?

56:55.673 --> 56:57.414
Two will suffice.

56:59.590 --> 57:00.852
Are we done?

57:00.895 --> 57:02.897
Checkout is 11 a.m.

57:02.941 --> 57:04.551
We don't do late checkout.

57:04.595 --> 57:07.119
Room 209, second level.

57:08.729 --> 57:11.123
-You want a dollar?
-Thanks.

57:11.166 --> 57:12.907
Thanks.

57:12.951 --> 57:16.433
[Nick] Put it in
the soda machine or somethin'.

57:16.476 --> 57:17.651
[Danny] Can I call my mom?

57:17.695 --> 57:19.044
[door latches]

57:19.087 --> 57:21.829
Not yet, I told you.
It'll ruin the surprise.

57:22.830 --> 57:24.745
She's gonna be mad.

57:24.789 --> 57:26.921
Yeah, well, tell you what,

57:26.965 --> 57:29.446
let's get settled,
then you can call.

57:29.489 --> 57:30.795
You take that bed.

57:33.537 --> 57:34.886
[Nick exhales]

57:37.062 --> 57:38.585
I don't have my toothbrush.

57:38.629 --> 57:41.545
-[Nick] It's okay.
-I can't brush my teeth.

57:41.588 --> 57:43.677
Hey, you can go one night
without brushing your teeth,

57:43.721 --> 57:45.853
they're not gonna fall out.

57:45.897 --> 57:48.116
Are you really my father?

57:48.160 --> 57:51.163
[mellow music]

57:54.688 --> 57:56.168
Of course, I am.

58:06.831 --> 58:09.834
[instrumental music]

58:24.675 --> 58:26.024
[sobbing]

58:29.593 --> 58:31.682
[cell phone ringing]

58:33.248 --> 58:36.730
-Hello.
-[Nick] Hello, Katie.

58:36.774 --> 58:39.037
So good to hear your voice.

58:39.080 --> 58:41.692
Eight years is a long time,
especially when spent

58:41.735 --> 58:44.172
in a six-by-nine room
with nothing to do but think.

58:44.216 --> 58:47.175
Nick, I had nothing to do
with you going back to prison.

58:47.219 --> 58:49.830
Oh, I know, Katie.
You were dead.

58:49.874 --> 58:51.876
[Katie]
What have you done to my son?

58:51.919 --> 58:54.095
-Don't you mean our son?
-He's not your son.

58:54.139 --> 58:56.663
Don't insult me.
We both know he's mine.

58:56.707 --> 58:58.709
Why didn't you tell me
we had a child?

58:58.752 --> 59:01.059
Oh, that's right, you were too
busy being dead.

59:01.102 --> 59:02.582
[sobbing] Let me speak to him.

59:02.626 --> 59:04.802
God, God, he must be scared
out of his mind.

59:04.845 --> 59:06.586
He's fine.

59:06.630 --> 59:09.154
[Katie] What do you want, Nick?

59:09.197 --> 59:10.895
-I wanna get to know my son.
-[Katie] Oh, yeah.

59:10.938 --> 59:12.679
You didn't have to kidnap him
to do that.

59:12.723 --> 59:14.942
[Nick] It's not kidnapping.
He came willingly.

59:14.986 --> 59:17.075
Bring him back to me now!

59:17.118 --> 59:20.078
[Nick] Or what?
What are you gonna do, Katie?

59:20.121 --> 59:21.862
-I'll call the police.
-Oh, you will?

59:21.906 --> 59:25.126
I would love, love to see
how that plays out.

59:26.258 --> 59:29.000
-Is that my mother?
-Danny?

59:29.043 --> 59:31.611
Danny? Nick,
Nick, put him on the phone.

59:31.655 --> 59:33.700
Please, please let me speak
to him.

59:33.744 --> 59:36.050
Careful what you say, Katie.

59:36.094 --> 59:39.706
-Mom?
-Oh, my God. Sweetie?

59:39.750 --> 59:41.969
It's so good to hear your voice.

59:42.013 --> 59:44.319
[Danny]
Mom, I want to come home.

59:44.363 --> 59:45.973
I know you do.

59:47.932 --> 59:51.065
But your father just wants to get to know you a little, okay?

59:51.109 --> 59:52.806
I-I don't have my toothbrush.

59:52.850 --> 59:55.026
I can't brush my teeth.

59:55.069 --> 59:57.811
[chuckles] You can brush them
twice when you come home.

59:58.856 --> 01:00:01.641
Mom, I don't wanna sleep here.

01:00:01.685 --> 01:00:04.078
Sleep? Sleep.
Uh, honey, where are you?

01:00:04.818 --> 01:00:06.646
Nice try, Katie.

01:00:06.690 --> 01:00:08.866
Something you don't
understand here, Katie, but...

01:00:10.302 --> 01:00:12.696
you don't control
this situation.

01:00:14.088 --> 01:00:15.829
Not anymore.

01:00:15.873 --> 01:00:17.614
Nick? Nick?

01:00:18.702 --> 01:00:20.007
God! Damn it.

01:00:25.143 --> 01:00:26.666
What?

01:00:26.710 --> 01:00:28.320
I don't like the way
you talk to her.

01:00:28.363 --> 01:00:32.411
[scoffs] We fight sometimes.
All couples do.

01:00:33.368 --> 01:00:35.283
When can I go home?

01:00:36.763 --> 01:00:38.069
You're not going home, pal.

01:00:38.112 --> 01:00:40.114
You're coming to Los Angeles
with me.

01:00:40.158 --> 01:00:42.639
-But I don't wanna go!
-You don't have a choice.

01:00:42.682 --> 01:00:43.944
Back inside.

01:00:51.822 --> 01:00:54.215
Let's be clear about something.

01:00:54.259 --> 01:00:56.827
I make the rules, you follow.

01:00:57.697 --> 01:00:58.872
Understood?

01:01:04.835 --> 01:01:07.272
[cell phone ringing]

01:01:07.315 --> 01:01:08.839
Nick?

01:01:08.882 --> 01:01:11.058
[Lucas] It's Lucas.

01:01:11.102 --> 01:01:12.451
Oh, hi, Lucas.

01:01:14.061 --> 01:01:16.673
Don't sound too enthusiastic.

01:01:16.716 --> 01:01:18.152
Listen, this is, um,
this is really

01:01:18.196 --> 01:01:20.981
not a great time to talk, okay?

01:01:21.025 --> 01:01:23.027
Tell me what's going on.

01:01:24.855 --> 01:01:26.030
I can't.

01:01:27.771 --> 01:01:29.773
I'm not taking no
for an answer.

01:01:37.737 --> 01:01:38.695
Hey.

01:01:41.785 --> 01:01:42.960
Thank you.

01:01:44.396 --> 01:01:46.746
-Why don't you sit down, too?
-I-I can't.

01:01:46.790 --> 01:01:49.270
I'm... I'm sorry,
I'm too wound up.

01:01:50.924 --> 01:01:53.318
This is about Danny's father,
isn't it?

01:01:53.361 --> 01:01:54.406
Yeah.

01:01:58.410 --> 01:01:59.933
He has Danny.

01:02:01.892 --> 01:02:04.416
-Does he have visitation rights?
-No, it's...

01:02:05.983 --> 01:02:07.462
It's a long story.

01:02:07.506 --> 01:02:09.508
Hey. Come on.

01:02:10.988 --> 01:02:12.511
Start at the beginning.

01:02:14.469 --> 01:02:15.862
Yeah?

01:02:22.173 --> 01:02:25.742
Yeah, I worked at this
art gallery. It's...

01:02:25.785 --> 01:02:28.745
[instrumental music]

01:02:33.010 --> 01:02:34.925
[indistinct chatter]

01:02:54.161 --> 01:02:55.859
Are you judging me?

01:02:56.860 --> 01:02:59.123
No. No.

01:03:01.473 --> 01:03:02.517
I just...

01:03:05.912 --> 01:03:08.262
How did you do it?

01:03:08.306 --> 01:03:10.308
How did you fake your suicide?

01:03:13.572 --> 01:03:15.574
[Katie] I left my car
on a bridge.

01:03:18.969 --> 01:03:20.971
It was the middle of the night.

01:03:23.147 --> 01:03:24.496
I left my...

01:03:26.324 --> 01:03:29.196
purse and my ID
on the car seat.

01:03:34.332 --> 01:03:37.335
I left a note about how trapped and hopeless I felt,

01:03:37.378 --> 01:03:39.380
how I had run out of options.

01:03:41.121 --> 01:03:42.906
That was my...

01:03:42.949 --> 01:03:45.386
first chance at freedom,
you know?

01:03:51.479 --> 01:03:53.525
He was never gonna let me go.

01:03:56.310 --> 01:03:58.573
And you were pregnant with Danny
this whole time?

01:03:58.617 --> 01:03:59.836
Yeah.

01:04:01.054 --> 01:04:03.274
That was a signal being
real positive,

01:04:03.317 --> 01:04:06.059
you know what I mean?

01:04:06.103 --> 01:04:08.192
Danny never felt like a mistake.

01:04:11.195 --> 01:04:13.893
He was my first...

01:04:13.937 --> 01:04:16.330
real piece of a new life.

01:04:16.374 --> 01:04:18.419
That means...

01:04:18.463 --> 01:04:22.554
Nick didn't know
that he had a son?

01:04:27.385 --> 01:04:29.039
No, he didn't know.

01:04:31.911 --> 01:04:33.608
You think that's fair?

01:04:38.091 --> 01:04:40.093
I wasn't thinking
about what was fair.

01:04:41.268 --> 01:04:44.054
I was thinking about surviving

01:04:44.097 --> 01:04:46.099
and protecting my son.

01:04:46.143 --> 01:04:49.015
You know, shortly after I found
out that he was sent to prison

01:04:49.059 --> 01:04:50.887
on an extortion charge,

01:04:50.930 --> 01:04:52.149
I looked into the case,
you know?

01:04:52.192 --> 01:04:54.064
He got off it so easy.

01:04:54.107 --> 01:04:55.587
Murders were happening all over,

01:04:55.630 --> 01:04:57.415
and the DA couldn't pin it
on anyone.

01:04:59.156 --> 01:05:01.114
I-I have no idea what kind
of business he was involved in,

01:05:01.158 --> 01:05:02.899
but it was clear
that these, these killings,

01:05:02.942 --> 01:05:04.248
these murders
were not gonna stop.

01:05:04.291 --> 01:05:06.903
Look, look,
all I'm, all I'm saying,

01:05:06.946 --> 01:05:11.081
all I'm saying,
is it, is it possible...

01:05:13.083 --> 01:05:15.259
that he just wants
to get to know his son?

01:05:15.302 --> 01:05:16.347
[scoffs]

01:05:17.435 --> 01:05:18.479
No.

01:05:19.654 --> 01:05:21.134
No, that's not it.

01:05:22.657 --> 01:05:27.227
You have no idea how capable
this guy is. Okay?

01:05:27.271 --> 01:05:29.142
I mean,
after, after everything I did,

01:05:29.186 --> 01:05:32.450
after-after how careful I was,
he still found me.

01:05:32.493 --> 01:05:35.018
And now it's like
he just wants to punish me.

01:05:35.061 --> 01:05:36.976
It's like, it's like
if he can't have me,

01:05:37.020 --> 01:05:39.022
he just, he just wants
to destroy me.

01:05:41.154 --> 01:05:42.939
Yeah...

01:05:42.982 --> 01:05:45.680
We need to go to the police.

01:05:45.724 --> 01:05:48.509
We need to tell them
all of this.

01:05:48.553 --> 01:05:49.946
I can't.

01:05:52.470 --> 01:05:54.602
I don't think
you have any other choice.

01:05:59.738 --> 01:06:02.480
Excuse me, sir. Um...

01:06:02.523 --> 01:06:04.525
I need to report
a missing child.

01:06:06.092 --> 01:06:09.095
[intense music]

01:06:30.769 --> 01:06:33.772
[music intensifies]

01:06:35.295 --> 01:06:36.644
[doorbell buzzes, door opens]

01:06:39.212 --> 01:06:40.257
[door closes]

01:06:52.356 --> 01:06:55.272
I couldn't go through with it.

01:06:55.315 --> 01:06:58.318
Uh, he literally got away
with murder. You know?

01:06:58.362 --> 01:07:00.494
A-and I've been the one
committing fraud here.

01:07:00.538 --> 01:07:02.279
[sighs]
Jesus, I...

01:07:02.322 --> 01:07:05.282
I left behind student loans, uh,
unpaid credit cards,

01:07:05.325 --> 01:07:09.242
a whole city
searching for my body.

01:07:09.286 --> 01:07:11.070
You know, they could see it
as a case where I kidnapped

01:07:11.114 --> 01:07:12.724
my own son
and I kept him on the run

01:07:12.767 --> 01:07:15.248
just-just to prevent him
from meeting his own father.

01:07:17.076 --> 01:07:19.035
I'd look like the guilty one.

01:07:21.080 --> 01:07:23.474
If the police find out who I am,
what are they gonna do?

01:07:23.517 --> 01:07:25.215
What are they gonna do to Danny?

01:07:25.258 --> 01:07:27.130
They're gonna put him
in the system?

01:07:27.173 --> 01:07:28.348
Or worse yet, they're gonna,
they're gonna

01:07:28.392 --> 01:07:30.394
give custody over to Nick.

01:07:32.526 --> 01:07:33.527
-Just take me home.
-Hey, it's...

01:07:33.571 --> 01:07:35.573
Just, please, take me home.

01:07:38.358 --> 01:07:39.403
Okay.

01:07:41.231 --> 01:07:42.232
Okay.

01:07:47.802 --> 01:07:48.847
[owl hooting]

01:07:55.245 --> 01:07:57.595
[footsteps treading]

01:07:57.638 --> 01:08:00.424
[intense music]

01:08:00.467 --> 01:08:01.512
Danny?

01:08:07.605 --> 01:08:08.606
Danny?

01:08:16.353 --> 01:08:17.571
[Danny] Mommy?

01:08:20.444 --> 01:08:21.575
Sweetie?

01:08:29.322 --> 01:08:30.367
Danny?

01:08:31.237 --> 01:08:34.240
[music continues]

01:08:41.682 --> 01:08:43.249
Sweetie.

01:08:45.729 --> 01:08:48.298
[whispers] Danny. Oh, God.

01:08:48.341 --> 01:08:50.300
Oh. Oh, Danny.

01:08:50.343 --> 01:08:52.389
Oh, sweetie.

01:08:52.432 --> 01:08:54.260
-Mommy?
-Oh, sweetie.

01:08:54.304 --> 01:08:56.219
I was so worried about you.
What happened?

01:08:56.261 --> 01:08:57.611
What happened? He let you go?

01:08:57.654 --> 01:09:00.353
Mommy, I'm scared.

01:09:00.397 --> 01:09:03.791
No, it's okay, sweetie.
You're safe, okay?

01:09:03.835 --> 01:09:06.142
I'm not gonna let him hurt you.

01:09:06.185 --> 01:09:07.621
He's here.

01:09:07.665 --> 01:09:10.624
[banging on door]

01:09:16.848 --> 01:09:18.589
[pounding on door]

01:09:18.631 --> 01:09:22.332
[Nick] Katie!

01:09:24.203 --> 01:09:25.161
[sighs]

01:09:25.944 --> 01:09:27.162
Hey.

01:09:28.294 --> 01:09:30.688
-You okay?
-Yeah.

01:09:30.731 --> 01:09:33.473
Just... had a bad dream.

01:09:33.517 --> 01:09:34.560
Oh.

01:09:40.479 --> 01:09:42.874
[snoring]

01:09:49.533 --> 01:09:52.536
[intense music]

01:09:54.886 --> 01:09:57.497
[door latch clanking]

01:10:01.632 --> 01:10:03.590
[clanking continues]

01:10:09.596 --> 01:10:12.599
[music continues]

01:10:24.872 --> 01:10:26.918
Can I help you with something?

01:10:26.961 --> 01:10:28.963
I need to call my mom.

01:10:30.400 --> 01:10:32.924
Are you in some kind
of trouble, kid?

01:10:32.967 --> 01:10:34.969
[telephone ringing]

01:10:36.319 --> 01:10:38.756
Front desk. Maggie speaking.

01:10:38.799 --> 01:10:41.367
Calling from room 209.
You happen to see my son?

01:10:42.586 --> 01:10:43.804
No, I haven't.

01:10:45.023 --> 01:10:46.981
Let me know if he turns up.

01:10:47.025 --> 01:10:48.679
[Maggie] Of course.

01:10:52.291 --> 01:10:54.250
What's your mother's number?

01:10:57.383 --> 01:10:58.428
Danny!

01:10:59.733 --> 01:11:01.300
Where are you, pal?

01:11:03.607 --> 01:11:06.305
Come on,
you should eat something.

01:11:06.349 --> 01:11:09.308
[cell phone ringing]

01:11:09.352 --> 01:11:10.744
-Hello?
-[Danny on phone] Mom?

01:11:10.788 --> 01:11:12.833
Oh, God. Oh, God. Thank God.

01:11:12.877 --> 01:11:15.401
-Danny, where are you?
-I'm in a motel.

01:11:15.445 --> 01:11:17.925
-[Katie on phone] Where's Nick?
-Upstairs.

01:11:17.969 --> 01:11:19.884
Danny, where is this motel?

01:11:19.927 --> 01:11:21.973
It's next to a big road.

01:11:22.016 --> 01:11:24.671
-A highway.
-D-do you know the name of it?

01:11:24.715 --> 01:11:26.369
-I don't know.
-Okay.

01:11:26.412 --> 01:11:27.805
Well, is there an adult there?

01:11:27.848 --> 01:11:29.937
There's a lady at the desk here.

01:11:29.981 --> 01:11:31.374
Let me speak to her.

01:11:31.417 --> 01:11:34.290
She wants to speak with you.

01:11:34.333 --> 01:11:35.769
[Maggie] This is Maggie.
Front desk.

01:11:35.813 --> 01:11:37.510
Maggie. Maggie, listen.

01:11:37.554 --> 01:11:40.383
My son, Danny,
he is in danger. Okay?

01:11:40.426 --> 01:11:41.949
The man he is with, his father,

01:11:41.993 --> 01:11:43.647
he doesn't have
good intentions.

01:11:43.690 --> 01:11:45.605
How can I help you?

01:11:45.649 --> 01:11:48.304
Uh, what's the name
of this motel? W-where is it?

01:11:48.347 --> 01:11:50.306
[Maggie] Highway Inn,
off Route 46.

01:11:50.349 --> 01:11:52.308
Highway Inn, Route 46?

01:11:52.351 --> 01:11:54.484
-Fifteen minutes.
-Okay, okay. Maggie, listen.

01:11:54.527 --> 01:11:55.789
I'm gonna be there
to pick him up soon.

01:11:55.833 --> 01:11:57.313
Can-can you just watch him?

01:11:57.356 --> 01:11:58.488
Just keep him safe
for 15 minutes?

01:11:58.531 --> 01:11:59.532
[Maggie] Your husband,

01:11:59.576 --> 01:12:00.794
I see him on the monitor.

01:12:00.838 --> 01:12:01.926
He's on his way down here.

01:12:01.969 --> 01:12:03.014
No, no, no, no.

01:12:03.057 --> 01:12:05.756
Can you tell Danny to hide?

01:12:05.799 --> 01:12:07.801
-He's gone.
-What?

01:12:07.845 --> 01:12:10.021
Gone? Where, where did he go?

01:12:11.414 --> 01:12:12.589
[Nick] Danny!

01:12:13.677 --> 01:12:15.026
Hey, Danny!

01:12:16.462 --> 01:12:17.550
This isn't a game!

01:12:19.726 --> 01:12:22.729
[intense music]

01:12:40.965 --> 01:12:42.488
[keyboard keys clacking]

01:12:44.055 --> 01:12:47.058
[ringing]

01:12:49.582 --> 01:12:50.975
-Yes?
-Hi, hi, I am so sorry.

01:12:51.018 --> 01:12:52.672
I didn't see you standing
right there.

01:12:52.716 --> 01:12:54.500
Are you sure
you haven't seen my boy?

01:12:54.544 --> 01:12:56.372
I'm sure.

01:12:56.415 --> 01:12:59.418
Don't you got security cameras
back there?

01:12:59.462 --> 01:13:01.072
-I've been busy.
-Ah.

01:13:04.641 --> 01:13:06.860
[Nick] Then how did that
get back there?

01:13:06.904 --> 01:13:08.384
What?

01:13:08.427 --> 01:13:11.517
My son's backpack.

01:13:11.561 --> 01:13:13.606
It says Danny on it real big.
Can't miss it.

01:13:13.650 --> 01:13:16.740
Where is he?
Are you hiding him back there?

01:13:16.783 --> 01:13:19.046
Don't you dare come back here!

01:13:19.090 --> 01:13:21.092
Where is my son?

01:13:23.573 --> 01:13:26.967
You want me to call the police?

01:13:33.626 --> 01:13:35.106
This isn't over.

01:13:39.893 --> 01:13:42.896
[intense music]

01:13:57.520 --> 01:13:58.738
Have you seen a little boy?

01:13:58.782 --> 01:14:00.087
Oh...

01:14:00.131 --> 01:14:01.785
No, sir, I haven't.

01:14:01.828 --> 01:14:03.830
Could he be
in one of these rooms?

01:14:03.874 --> 01:14:06.964
-Why?
-He likes to play hide and seek.

01:14:07.007 --> 01:14:09.096
-All the rooms are locked.
-Yeah, I need to see inside.

01:14:09.140 --> 01:14:12.448
-He's my son.
-I can't do that.

01:14:12.491 --> 01:14:14.580
You should speak
to the front office.

01:14:14.624 --> 01:14:17.627
Yeah, she doesn't like me
very much. Tell you what?

01:14:19.629 --> 01:14:20.978
Would you show me?

01:14:28.986 --> 01:14:30.944
Lucas, you really don't have
to come with me.

01:14:30.988 --> 01:14:33.164
Come on.
We're in this together.

01:14:33.207 --> 01:14:34.948
Okay, well,
can you move your truck?

01:14:34.992 --> 01:14:37.777
-Let's just take it.
-Wait. Danny won't recognize it.

01:14:37.821 --> 01:14:40.606
Yeah, well, neither will Nick.
What if this is a trap?

01:14:40.650 --> 01:14:42.652
What if he wants you
to come to this place?

01:14:42.695 --> 01:14:43.783
Okay. You're right.
Can you drive?

01:14:43.827 --> 01:14:45.698
-Yes.
-[cell phone ringing]

01:14:45.742 --> 01:14:47.613
[gasps] Hello?

01:14:47.657 --> 01:14:48.919
-[Danny on phone] It's me.
-Danny?

01:14:48.962 --> 01:14:50.703
Oh, my God! Thank God.
Are you okay?

01:14:50.747 --> 01:14:53.227
-I'm in a motel room.
-[Katie] Where's Nick?

01:14:53.271 --> 01:14:55.708
-Right outside.
-Are you safe, honey?

01:14:55.752 --> 01:14:57.536
I don't know. I snuck in here.

01:14:57.580 --> 01:15:00.147
[sighs] Good boy.

01:15:00.191 --> 01:15:04.064
-Did he hurt you?
-No. He wants to take me away.

01:15:04.108 --> 01:15:05.762
T-take you away? Where, where?

01:15:05.805 --> 01:15:07.633
-[Danny] Los Angeles.
-What? No.

01:15:07.677 --> 01:15:09.983
No, do not go with him.
Do you understand me?

01:15:10.027 --> 01:15:11.811
Kick and scream if you have to.
Do not go with him.

01:15:11.855 --> 01:15:13.683
-I can't talk, mom.
-Okay.

01:15:13.726 --> 01:15:15.511
Okay, honey, I love you.
I-I'll be there soon.

01:15:17.730 --> 01:15:19.079
-Same place?
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:15:20.211 --> 01:15:21.299
[door lock beeps]

01:15:32.179 --> 01:15:34.747
Sir, please, you're gonna
get me into trouble.

01:15:34.791 --> 01:15:37.271
[Nick] Show me the next room.
[woman] I'll be fired. I--

01:15:37.315 --> 01:15:39.709
[Nick] I don't care! Now!

01:15:42.668 --> 01:15:44.540
It's gonna be okay.

01:15:44.583 --> 01:15:46.106
-Just please drive faster.
-Okay.

01:15:46.150 --> 01:15:49.153
[intense music]

01:15:51.068 --> 01:15:52.069
[door beeps]

01:15:54.593 --> 01:15:55.594
Danny?

01:16:17.834 --> 01:16:18.922
[Nick] Danny!

01:16:21.315 --> 01:16:23.579
Come on, Danny!

01:16:23.622 --> 01:16:26.582
Game's over! Where are ya?

01:16:26.625 --> 01:16:29.106
Excuse me.
You're gonna have to leave.

01:16:29.149 --> 01:16:31.325
-You're disrupting the guests.
-Oh, yeah?

01:16:31.369 --> 01:16:33.284
You have a child missing
on the premises.

01:16:33.327 --> 01:16:35.634
Maybe you should be more
concerned with that, grandma.

01:16:35.678 --> 01:16:37.636
The sheriff is on his way.

01:16:54.305 --> 01:16:56.873
[Katie] Where is he?
Where is he? I don't see him.

01:16:56.916 --> 01:16:58.875
Here. Stop right here.
Stop right here.

01:16:58.918 --> 01:17:00.616
-I want to come--
-No, no, no, stay in the car.

01:17:00.659 --> 01:17:01.921
Keep the car running, okay?

01:17:03.009 --> 01:17:05.316
Danny? Danny?

01:17:07.666 --> 01:17:08.798
[Katie] Danny?

01:17:11.322 --> 01:17:12.323
Danny?

01:17:12.932 --> 01:17:14.151
Sweetie?

01:17:15.761 --> 01:17:17.241
Honey, you can hear me?

01:17:23.290 --> 01:17:25.684
Sweetie, it's your mom, sweetie.

01:17:25.728 --> 01:17:28.687
[Danny] Mom?
[Katie] Oh! Baby!

01:17:28.731 --> 01:17:30.297
-Come here.
-Mom!

01:17:30.341 --> 01:17:31.995
Oh. [mumbles]

01:17:32.038 --> 01:17:34.127
-Lucas.
-Hey, guys, come on, come on.

01:17:35.999 --> 01:17:37.914
Here, here, get in. Get in.

01:17:37.957 --> 01:17:39.176
Rest down here.

01:17:48.272 --> 01:17:50.709
[Lucas] Come on, let's go.
Come on.

01:17:50.753 --> 01:17:52.755
[intense music]

01:17:52.798 --> 01:17:54.800
[tires screeching]

01:17:54.844 --> 01:17:56.976
Hands up...

01:17:57.020 --> 01:17:58.412
or I'll blow your brains out.

01:17:58.456 --> 01:18:00.327
Lucas, are you seeing this?

01:18:00.371 --> 01:18:02.068
-Do you want me to go back?
-No. No, no, no.

01:18:02.112 --> 01:18:04.418
She's got it.

01:18:04.462 --> 01:18:06.725
Baby. Oh, God. Are you okay?

01:18:06.769 --> 01:18:08.379
Hey, buddy,
you did a good job back there.

01:18:09.902 --> 01:18:11.208
What now, Maggie?

01:18:11.251 --> 01:18:13.210
We are gonna wait
for the sheriff.

01:18:14.341 --> 01:18:15.821
Yeah?

01:18:15.865 --> 01:18:17.867
I think I'm gonna pass.

01:18:23.220 --> 01:18:25.222
[Nick] I wouldn't do that
if I were you.

01:18:28.268 --> 01:18:30.270
Have a nice life, grandma.

01:18:39.497 --> 01:18:42.108
Sweetie, wait. Are you okay?

01:18:42.152 --> 01:18:44.328
-We're fine. Thank you.
-Let's get him inside.

01:18:44.371 --> 01:18:46.199
Listen, I'm just gonna run in,
grab some bags

01:18:46.243 --> 01:18:47.723
and then we're gonna go.
Thank you.

01:18:47.766 --> 01:18:49.202
-Well, I'll come with you.
-Danny.

01:18:49.246 --> 01:18:50.900
Run in to the house, okay?
Run to your room.

01:18:50.943 --> 01:18:53.206
I've packed you a bag.
I'll be in a second, sweetie.

01:18:54.860 --> 01:18:56.775
Look, I know you're trying
to help, but honestly...

01:18:56.819 --> 01:18:58.472
You're not listening to me.
We're going, too.

01:18:58.516 --> 01:19:00.387
-Plus, you're blocking my car.
-Hey, hey, wait, wait, wait.

01:19:00.431 --> 01:19:03.477
-Where are you gonna go?
-I don't know.

01:19:03.521 --> 01:19:06.176
Look, I know you're trying to
help, but honestly, I gotta go.

01:19:09.135 --> 01:19:12.182
-Tell you what.
-He'll be here any second.

01:19:12.225 --> 01:19:13.879
-Take this.
-[gasps] What's that?

01:19:13.923 --> 01:19:16.447
-Just to protect you.
-No.

01:19:16.490 --> 01:19:18.188
Look, I know you care about me,

01:19:18.231 --> 01:19:19.493
but I don't wanna drag you
into this.

01:19:19.537 --> 01:19:22.279
And I certainly
don't want a gun.

01:19:22.322 --> 01:19:24.150
Look, we don't have time to talk
about this right now, okay?

01:19:24.194 --> 01:19:25.935
Thank you for everything.

01:19:39.992 --> 01:19:42.995
[intense music]

01:19:50.873 --> 01:19:52.831
Danny? We gotta go. Come on.

01:19:52.875 --> 01:19:54.311
Give me your bag.

01:19:54.354 --> 01:19:56.356
Okay. Get in the car, sweetie.

01:19:58.532 --> 01:19:59.577
Okay.

01:20:05.061 --> 01:20:07.541
Danny, go and get
inside the house, okay?

01:20:07.585 --> 01:20:11.110
Hey, babe.
Aren't you even gonna say hi?

01:20:11.154 --> 01:20:13.504
Where are you going? Come on!

01:20:22.382 --> 01:20:24.820
Um... Okay, listen.

01:20:24.863 --> 01:20:26.473
I want you to go to your room,
lock the door,

01:20:26.517 --> 01:20:28.171
don't let anyone in, okay?

01:20:28.214 --> 01:20:30.216
Do you understand me? Okay.

01:20:35.352 --> 01:20:37.920
[Nick] Let me in.

01:20:37.963 --> 01:20:39.443
What are you gonna do?

01:20:40.531 --> 01:20:41.967
Where are you gonna go?

01:20:42.925 --> 01:20:45.884
[music continues]

01:21:02.031 --> 01:21:03.075
Katie!

01:21:06.644 --> 01:21:08.864
Come on, Katie, this is silly.

01:21:08.907 --> 01:21:10.387
I just wanna talk!

01:21:12.345 --> 01:21:14.086
Maybe I'll go back to the house
to get Danny.

01:21:14.130 --> 01:21:16.132
-Boy needs a father.
-Hey!

01:21:18.047 --> 01:21:19.613
You stay away from him.

01:21:26.403 --> 01:21:29.406
[music continues]

01:21:47.076 --> 01:21:48.077
[grunts]

01:21:52.037 --> 01:21:53.473
-[grunts]
-Oops.

01:21:53.517 --> 01:21:56.128
It's no use, Katie.
Nowhere left to run.

01:21:56.172 --> 01:21:57.564
Come on, Nick,
what are you gonna do?

01:21:57.608 --> 01:21:59.566
-What, are you gonna kill me?
-Why not?

01:21:59.610 --> 01:22:01.220
-You're already dead.
-Don't do this.

01:22:01.264 --> 01:22:04.093
Shut up! You are so dumb.

01:22:04.136 --> 01:22:05.572
You made it so easy for me.

01:22:05.616 --> 01:22:08.662
Erased your identity,
isolated yourself.

01:22:08.706 --> 01:22:10.403
-I'll just take Danny.
-Don't do this.

01:22:10.447 --> 01:22:11.578
It'll be like you never existed.

01:22:11.622 --> 01:22:12.928
Don't do this.

01:22:12.971 --> 01:22:15.104
-Nick! Nick! Nick!
-[grunts]

01:22:15.147 --> 01:22:17.019
[Katie gasps] Lucas?

01:22:17.062 --> 01:22:18.455
Lucas, be careful!

01:22:19.369 --> 01:22:20.544
[groans]

01:22:20.587 --> 01:22:22.111
Lucas!

01:22:24.461 --> 01:22:25.984
-[groans]
-[Katie] No!

01:22:28.421 --> 01:22:30.597
No! Stop!

01:22:31.685 --> 01:22:32.948
Luc...

01:22:35.124 --> 01:22:36.995
Anna, get out of here.

01:22:37.039 --> 01:22:39.432
-[grunting]
-Ah!

01:22:40.259 --> 01:22:41.304
Ah!

01:22:48.311 --> 01:22:49.660
[Katie] Nick!

01:22:56.536 --> 01:22:58.364
I know you, Katie.

01:23:00.105 --> 01:23:02.455
You're too good of a person
to shoot me.

01:23:05.023 --> 01:23:07.417
My name is Anna now.

01:23:07.460 --> 01:23:08.679
[gunshot]

01:23:10.028 --> 01:23:12.988
[intense music]

01:23:18.689 --> 01:23:20.169
[gunshot]

01:23:23.085 --> 01:23:26.088
[birds chirping]

01:23:45.063 --> 01:23:46.325
[Katie] Hi, mom.

01:23:48.240 --> 01:23:49.589
You made it.

01:23:52.070 --> 01:23:54.029
[laughs] You're crushing me.

01:23:54.072 --> 01:23:56.031
Ah, I'm never gonna let you go.

01:24:00.252 --> 01:24:02.428
Danny, this is your granny.

01:24:02.472 --> 01:24:04.561
Come here, angel. Give me a hug.

01:24:04.604 --> 01:24:07.303
Oh!

01:24:07.346 --> 01:24:09.740
Is this Lucas? You didn't
tell me how handsome he is.

01:24:09.783 --> 01:24:12.569
[laughs] Lucas,
this is my mom, Evelyn.

01:24:12.612 --> 01:24:14.440
Oh. I got a hug for ya.

01:24:14.484 --> 01:24:18.183
Oh. Thank you so much
for taking care of my family.

01:24:18.227 --> 01:24:19.532
I hope to do it for a while.

01:24:19.576 --> 01:24:21.534
-Your house smells good.
-Oh.

01:24:21.578 --> 01:24:24.059
That's because I baked you
a big birthday cake.

01:24:24.102 --> 01:24:26.061
-But it's not my birthday today.
-Well, I know.

01:24:26.104 --> 01:24:27.758
But I've missed
eight of them already.

01:24:27.801 --> 01:24:30.413
We have a lot of catching up
to do. Come on.

01:24:30.456 --> 01:24:31.544
See what we have...

01:24:33.285 --> 01:24:36.158
You know, we gotta make up
for a lot of lost time, too.

01:24:36.201 --> 01:24:38.377
Yes. [chuckles]

01:24:42.816 --> 01:24:45.819
[instrumental music]

01:24:48.257 --> 01:24:51.260
[indistinct chatter]
