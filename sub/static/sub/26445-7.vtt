[chanting]
If you hump, you can't dump!

00:08.842 --> 00:11.261
If you hump, you can't dump!

00:11.344 --> 00:13.096
If you hump, you can't dump!

00:13.179 --> 00:15.015
Oh, my God. What is this?

00:15.098 --> 00:17.434
We're protesting you, Andrew.

00:17.517 --> 00:22.731
First, you blammo'd on my floor,
and then you blammo right out the door.

00:22.814 --> 00:23.690
[Matthew] Tell us.

00:23.773 --> 00:26.151
When exactly did you know
you were going to dump Lola?

00:26.234 --> 00:29.029
Was it before or after you came
in your Costco jeans?

00:29.112 --> 00:30.697
The time line's unclear.

00:30.780 --> 00:34.325
Oh, please. They were just
two horny kids getting their rocks off.

00:34.409 --> 00:36.119
I don't see what the big deal is.

00:36.202 --> 00:39.247
The big deal is
he knew he didn't like her,

00:39.330 --> 00:41.416
but he still chose to use her

00:41.499 --> 00:44.169
to defile his denim dungarees.

00:44.252 --> 00:45.920
Oh, shit. Is that what I did?

00:46.004 --> 00:48.631
-Nick, your friend sounds pretty gross.
-Look, Gina--

00:48.715 --> 00:51.468
I'm not gonna hang out with a guy
who's best friends with a creep.

00:51.551 --> 00:53.762
Does that mean
you do wanna hang out with a guy

00:53.845 --> 00:55.972
-who's not best friends with a creep?
-Maybe.

00:56.056 --> 00:57.640
-What are you doing this weekend?
-Nothing.

00:57.724 --> 00:59.601
Well, you should maybe make plans

00:59.684 --> 01:02.896
'cause it's weird
to be alone on a weekend.

01:02.979 --> 01:05.190
-Um, I'm gonna go to class now.
-All right.

01:05.273 --> 01:06.399
Click, click, bam!

01:06.483 --> 01:09.736
Lock him up! Lock him up!

01:09.819 --> 01:11.946
Jessi, you're protesting me, too?

01:12.030 --> 01:13.740
Well, if what Lola said is true,

01:13.823 --> 01:16.868
and I tend to believe her
because I listen to women...

01:16.951 --> 01:19.329
-So do I!
-...then you're a real slime bag, man.

01:19.412 --> 01:21.831
Yeah, Andrew.
I'm honestly very disappointed.

01:21.915 --> 01:24.042
I didn't think
you were that kind of a man.

01:24.125 --> 01:25.335
Oh, God.

01:25.418 --> 01:29.005
Harmless dweeb or disgusting sex monster?
You decide.

01:29.089 --> 01:30.924
Disgusting sex monster!

02:04.124 --> 02:05.708
-Rise and shine, Nicky.
-[groans]

02:05.792 --> 02:09.045
It's time to macho move
Jessi's dad into Guy Town.

02:09.129 --> 02:11.714
No ladies allowed, except in our hearts.

02:11.798 --> 02:14.425
Dad, it's too early for your enthusiasm.

02:14.509 --> 02:17.178
Uh-oh! Mr. Teenager has his claws out.
[meows]

02:17.262 --> 02:19.556
[chuckles softly]
Please don't do that.

02:19.639 --> 02:21.975
I'm just so jazzed
for our manly moving date.

02:22.058 --> 02:24.018
-Check this out.
-Is that a back brace for ladies?

02:24.102 --> 02:26.187
'Cause that's for sure Rosie the Riveter.

02:26.271 --> 02:28.273
Nobody messes with Rosie. She's tough.

02:28.356 --> 02:31.359
Like spending time
with my mother-in-law. Ha-ha!

02:31.442 --> 02:33.111
That's a man joke. I'm kidding.

02:33.194 --> 02:34.445
I love Nana.

02:34.529 --> 02:35.363
[groans]

02:36.072 --> 02:37.031
[clattering]

02:37.115 --> 02:37.949
Hello?

02:38.032 --> 02:41.202
Duke, are you having
a ghost orgy in my closet again?

02:41.286 --> 02:43.454
-[screaming]
-Oh my God!

02:43.538 --> 02:45.498
-Hey, there. Hey...
-[breathing heavily]

02:45.582 --> 02:48.168
-It's okay, you can come out.
-You scared me.

02:48.251 --> 02:50.211
-I'm Tyler.
-Are you my new Hormone Monster?

02:50.295 --> 02:52.797
I sure am, and you're my first kid.

02:52.881 --> 02:55.091
-You've never done this before?
-No way, Jose.

02:55.175 --> 02:58.219
I'm a monster-in-training.
That's why I don't have my horn yet.

02:58.303 --> 03:00.430
-I don't get it until I'm certified.
-Oh!

03:00.513 --> 03:02.515
So... what should we do first?

03:02.599 --> 03:04.392
Well, I'm actually glad you're here.

03:04.475 --> 03:07.562
There's this girl, Gina, I like,
and she just broke up with her boyfriend.

03:07.645 --> 03:09.772
Okay, that's great. We're diving right in.

03:09.856 --> 03:12.233
Girls are so cool.

03:12.317 --> 03:13.693
Don't understand them,

03:13.776 --> 03:14.986
-but I love them.
-Uh-huh.

03:15.069 --> 03:16.362
-Know what you should do?
-What?

03:16.446 --> 03:17.655
-Get rose petals...
-Yeah?

03:17.739 --> 03:19.324
...and make a trail from her locker

03:19.407 --> 03:20.700
-to the cafeteria...
-Okay.

03:20.783 --> 03:24.954
...but then you're in the cafeteria
standing up on a lunch table,

03:25.038 --> 03:27.081
-and then you do a cool dance...
-Cool dance?

03:27.165 --> 03:29.042
...and then balloons drop
from the ceiling,

03:29.125 --> 03:31.294
and the balloon say "Gina"!

03:31.377 --> 03:34.631
Um... my first instinct
is that sounds kind of corny.

03:34.714 --> 03:36.007
Dang! Stupid!

03:36.090 --> 03:38.176
-What about something else? Other ideas?
-Sure, sure.

03:38.259 --> 03:39.761
-Okay, here's what you do.
-Okay.

03:39.844 --> 03:43.681
You sneak up on her,
and you put your shirt over her head,

03:43.765 --> 03:46.809
and when she's blind, you scream, "Gina!"

03:46.893 --> 03:49.562
-That seems like assault.
-Yep, it is.

03:49.646 --> 03:51.522
-Okay, reboot.
-Uh-huh.

03:51.606 --> 03:53.983
-Girls love to be saved.
-Do they?

03:54.067 --> 03:56.945
So let's find
a nice remote set of train tracks--

03:57.028 --> 04:00.156
-I'm gonna stop you right there, okay?
-God, I suck at this!

04:00.240 --> 04:02.575
Tyler, you shitty tit-sucker.

04:02.659 --> 04:05.203
You're never gonna get your horn.
Nick hates you!

04:05.286 --> 04:06.996
-I don't hate you.
-You don't?

04:07.080 --> 04:08.248
No, not yet.

04:08.331 --> 04:10.333
-Good. We're friends again!
-Yeah.

04:10.416 --> 04:12.377
-Let me take a picture of your penis.
-What?

04:12.460 --> 04:15.755
For my phone!
So when you call, I know it's you.

04:17.006 --> 04:19.217
I don't understand
why they call this the bitch seat.

04:19.300 --> 04:22.637
I get to rest my hands on the knees
of two men who I truly love.

04:22.720 --> 04:24.472
Take your hand off my knee.

04:24.555 --> 04:26.474
I really appreciate
you guys being here for me.

04:26.557 --> 04:28.351
Ugh, look at his place!

04:28.434 --> 04:30.728
It's like a daycare center for lonely men.

04:30.812 --> 04:32.939
Why would anybody move into Guy Town?

04:33.022 --> 04:35.358
Well, since Guy Bilzerian
is my divorce lawyer,

04:35.441 --> 04:37.568
I get 200 bucks off
the first month's rent.

04:37.652 --> 04:38.987
Okay, that's enough for me.

04:39.070 --> 04:42.282
Besides, this is what I deserve
for exposing Jessi to my edibles.

04:42.365 --> 04:44.867
-I'm trash.
-No. You are not trash.

04:44.951 --> 04:46.619
You're just in the recycling bin,

04:46.703 --> 04:49.539
waiting for life to turn you
into two-thirds of a coffee cup.

04:49.622 --> 04:51.958
Oh, please! Recycling's a scam,

04:52.041 --> 04:53.584
like stuffed-crust pizza.

04:53.668 --> 04:55.378
It's just more cheese and bread.

04:55.461 --> 04:58.172
You're actually losing tomato sauce!

04:58.631 --> 04:59.549
[Marty grunts]

04:59.632 --> 05:01.009
Did you boys have fun back there?

05:01.092 --> 05:02.760
-No, not really.
-I had fun.

05:02.844 --> 05:05.013
I threw up
in that Simplehuman garbage can.

05:05.096 --> 05:08.766
Oh! That's no good
'cause that's a nice-ass trash can.

05:08.850 --> 05:11.519
That's right. I'm back, you motherfuckers.

05:11.602 --> 05:12.937
What's my life span?

05:13.021 --> 05:14.564
It is unclear.

05:15.106 --> 05:17.317
-You're Maury, right?
-Yeah, no pictures.

05:17.400 --> 05:19.777
I'm Tyler. I'm a huge fan.

05:19.861 --> 05:22.822
Your work with Bret Michaels
was truly inspiring.

05:22.905 --> 05:24.949
-You know, Rock of Love was my idea.
-Really?

05:25.033 --> 05:27.243
-What's that you got there?
-It's a present for Nick.

05:27.327 --> 05:29.037
I'm really good at drawing weapons,

05:29.120 --> 05:32.665
so I drew him a sword,
and I have a wicked crossbow!

05:32.749 --> 05:34.417
Don't bring him presents.
That's weird, man.

05:34.500 --> 05:35.835
Okay. Thanks for the advice.

05:35.918 --> 05:37.712
God, I'm so excited!

05:37.795 --> 05:40.715
I'm gonna make
this little boy's dick so hard!

05:40.798 --> 05:41.924
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

05:42.008 --> 05:44.302
Hey, man.
That's not how we talk about these things.

05:44.385 --> 05:45.928
Oh, sorry. Thank you. Yeah.

05:46.012 --> 05:49.307
I'm gonna make
this little boy's penis so hard.

05:49.390 --> 05:50.308
That's better.

05:50.391 --> 05:51.851
I'm here in Guy Town,

05:51.934 --> 05:54.562
the local hive of toxic masculinity.

05:54.645 --> 05:56.105
Matthew? What are you doing here?

05:56.189 --> 05:57.607
I'm exposé-ing you.

05:57.690 --> 06:00.485
People wanna continue hating you,
and I'm gonna give them what they want.

06:00.568 --> 06:02.570
I'm using my backpack as a dolly.

06:02.653 --> 06:04.197
[Matthew]
Defend yourself, pig.

06:04.280 --> 06:07.367
Okay, yes.
I did give into my most primal urges,

06:07.450 --> 06:12.372
but in my defense, who among us has not
excited their shaft for carnal relief?

06:12.455 --> 06:13.539
-I would appreciate--
-Cut!

06:13.623 --> 06:15.208
Was that no good?
I was just being honest.

06:15.291 --> 06:18.044
You were being creepy and weirdly formal,
Professor Pervert.

06:18.127 --> 06:20.380
Indeed, Professor Pervert.

06:20.463 --> 06:22.423
What are you teaching next semester?

06:22.507 --> 06:24.842
Ogling 101? Jizz-a-nomatry?

06:24.926 --> 06:28.137
Oh, please. You can't learn
Jizz-a-nomatry in a classroom.

06:28.221 --> 06:31.849
You've gotta get out in the field
and, you know, jack off in a field.

06:31.933 --> 06:33.476
Some scarecrow watching.

06:33.559 --> 06:35.436
Oh, man, that dude's a fucking weirdo.

06:35.520 --> 06:37.188
-What's up, jerks?
-Hey, Jay.

06:37.271 --> 06:41.609
Get ready for your minds to end up
like my dad's dick on my mom's birthday:

06:41.692 --> 06:43.194
Totally sucked off.

06:43.277 --> 06:45.405
-Ugh!
-I present to you... Guy Town!

06:45.488 --> 06:47.490

Hey! I like your mustache.

08:34.680 --> 08:37.391
I bet you have lots of pubes.
Can I see them?

08:37.475 --> 08:39.393
Hey, man. Again, not the way we do things.

08:39.477 --> 08:42.271
Andrew, will you be a dear
and refasten my locket?

08:42.355 --> 08:44.607
-Dad...
-Actually, the locket is for Greg.

08:44.690 --> 08:48.319
Inside is a picture
of who he needs to love the most:

08:48.402 --> 08:49.570
Himself.

08:49.654 --> 08:51.572
Okay, if it's Greg's,
why are you wearing it?

-To warm it up.
-What?

08:55.618 --> 08:57.662
and it's just too darn cold on your skin?

08:57.745 --> 09:00.498
-No, no idea.
-Dad, can we not talk about the locket?

09:00.581 --> 09:02.833
Sure. What do you wanna talk about?

-who are having a tough time?

09:12.760 --> 09:15.304
Maybe he's right.
I mean, he did get your mom,

09:15.388 --> 09:16.806
-and she's hot.
-Hey, rookie!

09:16.889 --> 09:18.849
Don't talk about the mom stuff
in front of the kid.

09:18.933 --> 09:21.519
But mommy titties are the softest.

09:21.602 --> 09:23.854
Nicky, you have to tell her how you feel.

09:23.938 --> 09:26.232
Be vulnerable and romantic.

09:26.315 --> 09:27.149
[sighs deeply]

09:27.233 --> 09:32.530
Gina, you make me feel
vulnerable and romantic.

09:32.613 --> 09:33.656
Send.

09:34.448 --> 09:35.950
Oh, she's gonna love it!

09:36.033 --> 09:37.451
She's gonna hate it.

09:37.535 --> 09:40.121
Why is she typing so slowly?

09:40.204 --> 09:41.664
-What did she say?
-"Ha."

09:41.747 --> 09:44.584
-Just says "Ha."
-Ooh! A single ha.

09:44.667 --> 09:46.043
Yeah, that ain't laughing.

09:46.502 --> 09:49.255
This unit has a killer layout.

09:49.338 --> 09:51.215
The Jerk-off Nook has a view of the pool.

09:51.299 --> 09:53.217
Are you boys moving in?

09:53.301 --> 09:55.595
No. We're helping our dear friend, Greg.

09:55.678 --> 09:57.638
[gasps] I have that same kimono.

09:57.722 --> 10:00.975
If this kimono could talk,
it'd be nothing but bullshit.

10:01.058 --> 10:05.062
[laughs] You know, I had to stop wearing
mine because the silk was too rough.

10:05.146 --> 10:06.272
You didn't have that problem?

10:06.355 --> 10:09.900
Baby doll, with the amount of tanning
I've done, I feel nothing.

10:09.984 --> 10:11.360
My tummy's like a wallet.

10:11.444 --> 10:13.070
-Can I borrow a 20?
-[laughs]

10:13.154 --> 10:15.406
Nick, I'm pretty sure
this guy thinks your dad is...

10:15.489 --> 10:16.574
I can see what's happening.

10:16.657 --> 10:18.492
-...a proud member of the LGBT.
-I get it!

10:18.576 --> 10:21.287
Bye! Stop by if you need a cup of sugar.

10:21.370 --> 10:22.413
Or tequila!

10:22.496 --> 10:24.206
Well, what do we have here?

10:24.290 --> 10:26.959
You must be the sad old queen of Guy Town.

10:27.043 --> 10:30.421
Ah! You must be
the catty little gay character.

10:30.504 --> 10:34.091
I'm sorry, but I don't want a flyer
for your cabaret show.

10:34.175 --> 10:36.344
I'm busy at noon on a Thursday.

10:36.427 --> 10:39.180
Oh, that's quick.
Listen, baby Billy Eichner,

10:39.263 --> 10:42.099
being young, gay, and mean
is not a personality.

10:42.183 --> 10:44.727
Nick, I think we're witnessing a gay duel.

10:44.810 --> 10:46.687
I've never seen anyone
talk to Matthew like this.

10:46.771 --> 10:49.148
Oh, well, for your information,
Martha Raye,

10:49.231 --> 10:51.567
I'm more than young, gay, and mean.

10:51.651 --> 10:53.277
Really? What else have you got?

10:53.361 --> 10:57.239
Uh... I happen to be investigating a boy
who jizzed in his pants.

10:57.323 --> 10:59.325
Oh, honey, that's how I wasted my 20s.

10:59.408 --> 11:01.118
Goodbye, Peter Twink-lage.

11:01.202 --> 11:03.537
[puffing]

11:03.871 --> 11:06.916
Matthew, I don't think
that you're just gay and mean.

11:06.999 --> 11:10.336
Who cares what you think,
you bag of burrata!

11:10.419 --> 11:12.630
You know,
burrata's actually pretty expensive,

11:12.713 --> 11:14.215
so I take that as a compliment.

11:14.298 --> 11:16.842
I do it with tomato and peach.
No one's listening.

11:16.926 --> 11:19.553
I'm listening. That shit sounds good.

11:19.637 --> 11:21.972
Sweet and savory? Okay!

11:22.056 --> 11:24.183
Argh! Nothing is up to code in here!

11:24.266 --> 11:26.560
You see that?
That's supposed to be a smoke detector.

11:26.644 --> 11:30.398
♪ I'm a lady bass
with a belly full of eggs ♪

11:30.481 --> 11:31.982
That's disgusting.

11:32.066 --> 11:34.652
Also, is that a parody of a song
we're supposed to know?

11:35.486 --> 11:37.196
Whoa! Greg gets a waterbed?

11:37.279 --> 11:38.948
Cool, right? We also have water-cribs

11:39.031 --> 11:41.701
if you're dumb enough
to get custody of your stupid baby.

11:41.784 --> 11:43.661
[bones snapping, groans]
Oh, boy!

11:43.744 --> 11:46.497
I knew I was pushing it
with this box of blankets.

11:46.580 --> 11:49.750
Big Nicky, help lower
your little daddy to the floor.

11:49.834 --> 11:52.878
-[groans]
-Gently! Your little daddy's delicate.

11:52.962 --> 11:54.171
-[Nick grunts]
-Ouch!

11:54.255 --> 11:57.049
I think we should look away.
You know, out of respect.

11:57.133 --> 12:00.511
But it seems like he's doing it
for our benefit?

12:00.594 --> 12:03.764
[meows]

12:03.848 --> 12:05.641
Why is there carpet in the kitchen?

12:05.725 --> 12:07.893
Do you have any idea
of the mold that could form?

12:07.977 --> 12:09.353
What is this place?

12:09.437 --> 12:12.314
What am I supposed to do?
Go out and find an apartment I like?

12:12.398 --> 12:14.400
Get my credit checked?
Buy some furniture?

12:14.483 --> 12:16.569
Stop waking up in the middle of the night
to smoke pot?

12:16.652 --> 12:19.655
Yes, Greg!
That's what you're supposed to do.

12:19.739 --> 12:21.198
It's called being a man.

12:21.282 --> 12:23.784
-Well, clearly I failed as a man.
-Oh!

12:23.868 --> 12:25.745
Jay, can you take my lease up to your dad?

12:25.828 --> 12:28.789
[screams] Dammit!
And tell him we need a surge protector.

12:28.873 --> 12:29.957
There are no outlets!

12:30.040 --> 12:34.837
Just one extension cord that goes
all the way to the Chevron next door.

12:34.920 --> 12:36.255
[bell dings]

12:36.338 --> 12:38.215
[grunts] My dad is such a wuss.

12:38.299 --> 12:41.177
-I wish he could be more like your dad.
-Oh, cheap and angry?

12:41.260 --> 12:42.845
No! Like a man.

12:42.928 --> 12:44.764
Well, my dad is not a man.

12:44.847 --> 12:47.349
He is a one-star Yelp review come to life.

12:47.433 --> 12:49.268
All right, guys.
You'd better Yentl your tits

12:49.351 --> 12:52.730
'cause we're about to enter
the most macho place on Earth.

12:53.189 --> 12:54.064
[Nick] Whoa!

12:54.148 --> 12:58.235
This is like the nicest suite
at the worst hotel in Atlantic City.

12:58.319 --> 13:00.488
Yeah, this blood smuggler
couldn't pay my dad,

13:00.571 --> 13:03.491
so he gave him a fuck-ton of marble.
It's super easy to hose down.

13:03.574 --> 13:06.368
-Jay, I need more ketchup.
-Nice! I'll get you some more packets.

13:06.452 --> 13:10.289
Hey, Jay, why is your dad eating a steak
dinner in an old-fashioned barber chair?

13:10.372 --> 13:11.665
Jay, jack me up!

13:11.749 --> 13:12.833
You got it, Dad!

13:12.917 --> 13:15.377
Guy, your toilet's out of water again.

13:15.461 --> 13:17.254
That's how I know
you're not shitting in there.

13:17.338 --> 13:19.423
[giggling]
Oh, Guy, you're terrible.

13:19.507 --> 13:20.758
Yeah, he really is.

13:20.841 --> 13:24.011
Guys, this is my dad's
super-cool receptionist, Taffiny.

13:24.094 --> 13:26.555
Oh! What happened to your wrist, sweetie?

13:26.639 --> 13:28.057
[softly] Go on. Tell her.

13:28.140 --> 13:29.642
Oh, nothing.

13:29.725 --> 13:32.019
He dry-humped a girl and dumped her,
so she broke his wrist.

13:32.102 --> 13:34.396
[laughs] Wow!
This kid humped and dumped.

13:34.480 --> 13:37.024
Well, I came, and then went.

13:37.107 --> 13:38.442
You're a little pimp, aren't you?

13:38.526 --> 13:40.319
Oh, I don't know. Maybe.

13:40.402 --> 13:42.238
Uh, you know, some say I'm a creep.

13:42.321 --> 13:45.157
Fuck that! You're just a 13-year-old man

13:45.241 --> 13:46.450
who took what he wanted.

13:46.534 --> 13:49.245
-Ha!
-Like me. I live balls out,

13:49.328 --> 13:51.956
and I give zero fucks.

13:52.039 --> 13:53.666
That's pimp. Right, Taffiny?

13:53.749 --> 13:55.709
That's what I'm talking about.

13:55.793 --> 13:58.045
Let's live that pimp life.
Whoop! Whoop!

13:58.128 --> 14:00.130
Is that what you are, Andrew?

14:00.214 --> 14:02.883
-A greasy little pimp?
-I don't know.

14:02.967 --> 14:05.261
It does seem like a lot more fun
than being a creep.

14:05.344 --> 14:07.513
-And I've got the whole outfit--
-At the Halloween store?

14:07.596 --> 14:09.765
-Yeah, the Halloween store.
-You know what, little stud?

14:09.849 --> 14:11.851
You're coming
to the players' ball tonight.

14:11.934 --> 14:15.104
-I'm making you Pimp of the Month.
-Mazel tov, baby.

14:15.187 --> 14:17.773
Okay, yeah!
I'm the Pimp of the Month.

14:17.857 --> 14:19.400
Give me the cash, bitches.

14:21.735 --> 14:25.197
Nick! Jay's Dad is a total stud muffin.

14:25.281 --> 14:26.907
You should ask him about Gina.

14:26.991 --> 14:28.993
Ha. That's actually not a bad idea.

14:29.076 --> 14:30.619
Um... Mr. Bilzerian,

14:30.703 --> 14:32.746
there's this girl at school
who I really like,

14:32.830 --> 14:35.749
but I don't know how to ask her out.
What do you think I should do?

14:35.833 --> 14:36.667
Oh, that's simple.

14:36.750 --> 14:39.712
You just need to remind her
that you're better than she is.

14:39.795 --> 14:41.881
-That seems mean.
-Yeah, mean guys fuck.

14:41.964 --> 14:44.008
-Nice guys clean it up.
-[Tyler] Ew!

14:44.091 --> 14:47.177
I don't wanna clean up
someone else's oopy-soup.

14:47.261 --> 14:48.095
Ugh!

14:48.178 --> 14:50.556
[Matthew]
So Andrew, you're a pimp now.

14:50.639 --> 14:52.474
How does that change things for you?

14:52.558 --> 14:53.893
Well, if I had my druthers,

14:53.976 --> 14:56.061
-I'd invest in a bejeweled chalice...
-Fancy drink.

14:56.145 --> 14:58.480
A shirt with a collar
that goes past my shoulders.

14:58.564 --> 15:01.317
-This motherfucker looks good.
-I may dabble in a little black voice,

15:01.400 --> 15:03.652
-I'm sure I'll pull back on that quick.
-That's what's up.

15:03.736 --> 15:07.156
And I certainly won't be afraid
to strut my stuff.

15:07.239 --> 15:09.783
-Not scared of the strut!
-It's an equilibrium thing.

15:09.867 --> 15:11.160
Oh, look at you.

15:11.243 --> 15:13.537
You're wobbling around
like a newborn horse.

15:13.621 --> 15:15.372
That's right. Newborn horse.

15:15.456 --> 15:17.583
Big-ass knees.
Wibble-dy wobble-dy.

15:17.666 --> 15:20.294
Andrew, you're not a pimp!
Quit pretending to be one.

15:20.377 --> 15:21.587
Maybe I wanna be a pimp!

15:21.670 --> 15:24.423
I'm sick of feeling bad
about all the bad things that I do,

15:24.506 --> 15:26.133
and I wanna forget them and be pimp.

15:26.216 --> 15:29.261
That's right. Living that unexamined life!

15:29.637 --> 15:32.306
Why do you have cassette tapes
of a band called "Puh-Hish"?

15:32.389 --> 15:34.767
-It's Phish, Marty.
-Who cares? It's all clutter.

15:34.850 --> 15:36.477
That's not clutter.
Those are memories.

15:37.144 --> 15:38.062
-Whoa!
-I know you think

15:38.145 --> 15:40.272
because my vision's bad
I don't smell well,

15:40.356 --> 15:42.191
but nothing could be further
from the truth.

15:42.274 --> 15:44.276
-I'm sorry, who are you?
-I'm your new roommate, Leo.

15:44.360 --> 15:46.487
-Huh? I have a roommate?
-Couple of ground rules.

15:46.570 --> 15:48.113
I like to fall asleep to Frasier,

15:48.197 --> 15:50.532
and the dishwasher, my friend,
is only for jewelry.

15:50.616 --> 15:53.786
I know you.
You're Rabbi Poblart's adult son.

15:53.869 --> 15:57.414
I heard about your failed wigs
for religious dogs business.

15:57.498 --> 15:59.959
Uh-huh. Well, if you heard about it
from the dogs,

16:00.042 --> 16:02.044
you're only getting one side
of the story.

16:02.127 --> 16:04.880
Okay. So what's the other side
of the story?

16:04.964 --> 16:08.008
This motherfucker's scary,
and he's Greg's roommate?

16:08.092 --> 16:09.677
No. No, no, no.

16:09.760 --> 16:11.053
Darkness ascends...

16:11.136 --> 16:12.388
Mm-mmm. No, thank you.

16:12.471 --> 16:15.599
Caleb, do you think
I'm just young, gay, and mean?

16:15.683 --> 16:17.434
-[Caleb] Yes.
-I'm a lot more than that.

16:17.518 --> 16:19.979
I have a whole backstory
about how I used to live in Texas,

16:20.062 --> 16:22.856
and I got bullied online.
They called me the steer queer.

16:22.940 --> 16:25.484
-[Caleb] Nobody wants to hear about that.
-Exactly!

16:25.567 --> 16:27.945
They just want me to be
sharp and cutting and funny.

16:28.028 --> 16:29.571
-[Caleb] Are you funny?
-Yes!

16:29.655 --> 16:32.241
And stylish, and I'm a good person.

16:32.324 --> 16:34.410
[Caleb] That is not
what others say about you.

16:34.493 --> 16:36.161
Okay, turn off the camera.

16:36.245 --> 16:38.580
-Why won't Gina write back?
-I don't know.

16:38.664 --> 16:40.749
-Do you think my text was too mean?
-What did you say?

16:40.833 --> 16:42.793
-Well, Guy said I should be mean to her.
-Gotcha.

16:42.876 --> 16:44.837
So I wrote,
"You want to do something tomorrow?"

16:44.920 --> 16:47.172
And then, "Oh, shit.
That was meant for someone else."

16:47.256 --> 16:48.757
Ooh, yes!

16:48.841 --> 16:51.176
-That's pimp.
-That's what's up. Pimps and scrimps.

16:51.260 --> 16:53.262
-No, boys, that's ew.
-Dad...

16:53.345 --> 16:55.014
I hate to insult someone
behind their back,

16:55.097 --> 16:57.808
but Guy Bilzerian
is not the kind of man you wanna be.

16:57.891 --> 17:00.310
-What? No.
-He may look fancy from the outside,

17:00.394 --> 17:03.647
but he's falling apart on the inside,
just like this building.

17:03.731 --> 17:06.442
Uh, Dr. Birch,
you're sounding like a hater.

17:06.525 --> 17:08.235
-Haters gonna hate.
-I hate this hater!

17:08.318 --> 17:09.737
Yeah, what do you know, Dad?

17:09.820 --> 17:11.739
You gave me terrible advice about Gina,

17:11.822 --> 17:14.992
and you can't even carry a couple
of blankets without hurting yourself.

17:15.075 --> 17:17.953
Uh-oh! The claws are out again.
[meows]

17:18.037 --> 17:19.663
-Stop doing that.
-[purring]

17:19.747 --> 17:21.749
-Stop purring, Dad.
-Yeah, stop it!

17:21.832 --> 17:25.210
Why can't you be more of a man
and not such a... a pussy?

17:25.294 --> 17:27.337
[gasps, imitates cat wailing]

17:27.796 --> 17:30.215
What does your pretty mommy
even see in him?

17:30.966 --> 17:32.259
-[phone chimes]
-She wrote back.

17:32.342 --> 17:34.011
-What did she say?
-She said, "Ew."

17:34.094 --> 17:37.014
Titty-shits!
Now I'm never gonna get my horn.

17:37.097 --> 17:39.099
So you're making this about you?

17:39.183 --> 17:40.476
Yeah.

17:40.851 --> 17:42.352
[Steve] DJ Pendejo,

17:42.436 --> 17:46.065
coming at you live
from the players' ball.

17:46.148 --> 17:47.566
Scritchy-scitchy-scratch!

17:47.649 --> 17:49.651
Coach Steve? Why are you at Guy Town?

17:49.735 --> 17:54.531
I do my laundry here,
and in return, I DJ for free.

17:54.615 --> 17:56.325
But I do accept tips

17:56.408 --> 17:59.953
like how do you get people
to make eye contact with you?

18:00.037 --> 18:02.498
So is this a monthly thing, or--

18:02.581 --> 18:05.584
Time has lost all its meaning for me.
Soon it will for you, too.

18:05.667 --> 18:07.669
Oh, no, I don't plan on staying here long.

18:07.753 --> 18:10.839
That's what my last roommate said.
Then he died of penis worms.

18:10.923 --> 18:13.258
-They ate his flesh from the dick out.
-Whoa!

18:13.342 --> 18:16.637
Ah! There you are!
Your father's very upset.

18:16.720 --> 18:19.431
He won't even drink
the little saucer of milk I gave him.

18:19.515 --> 18:21.475
How did I end up
with such a weirdo for a dad?

18:21.558 --> 18:24.269
Look, your dad does a lot of stuff
that drives me crazy.

18:24.353 --> 18:27.272
The kissing on the mouth.
He orders appetizers.

18:27.356 --> 18:30.526
-He asks me how I'm doing. Who cares?!
-But Mr. Glouberman, I'm just saying--

18:30.609 --> 18:33.529
The point is, the man is smart
and he knows who he is,

18:33.612 --> 18:35.697
which is more than you can say
for most people.

18:35.781 --> 18:37.783
-Yeah.
-Now, if you'll excuse me,

18:37.866 --> 18:39.868
I'm gonna go break down boxes,

18:39.952 --> 18:41.787
which is my favorite thing to do.

18:41.870 --> 18:43.288
Guy Townies,

18:43.372 --> 18:46.375
ladies I found on the street in Trenton.

18:46.458 --> 18:50.170
I want to introduce you
to the Pimp of the Month.

18:50.254 --> 18:51.755
[all chanting] Pimp of the Month!

18:51.839 --> 18:52.923
Jesus!

18:53.006 --> 18:56.051
These sad men
keep getting younger and younger.

18:56.135 --> 18:57.719
[chanting]
Pimp of the Month!

18:57.803 --> 19:01.807
Will you please tell us all
about your signature move,

19:01.890 --> 19:04.268
-the Cream and Shuffle.
-Cream and Shuffle?

19:04.351 --> 19:07.104
Oh, what do you mean?
A hump and dump? Oh, okay.

19:07.187 --> 19:10.524
Hello. So I was at this girl's condo...

19:10.607 --> 19:11.984
What's the address?

19:12.067 --> 19:14.069
-Uh... Dad?
-Hey.

19:14.153 --> 19:15.863
What are you doing here, jelly bean?

19:15.946 --> 19:17.614
I wanted to surprise you.

19:17.698 --> 19:19.616
Ugh! Who are these guys,

19:19.700 --> 19:21.326
and what's Andrew doing?

19:21.410 --> 19:23.954
So I don't like this girl at all,

19:24.037 --> 19:26.665
-but she wanted to rub fronts.
-[man] Rub fronts!

19:26.748 --> 19:28.458
Yeah, this guy knows
what I'm talking about.

19:28.542 --> 19:30.544
and I thought it would feel good,
you know?

19:30.627 --> 19:32.087
So I did it anyway,

19:32.171 --> 19:34.631
even though I knew that I didn't like her.

19:34.715 --> 19:35.841
[man] Speak up!

19:35.924 --> 19:37.384
And then I broke up with her,

19:37.467 --> 19:39.219
and she... she cried,

19:39.303 --> 19:41.847
and, uh... yeah,
now that I say it out loud,

19:41.930 --> 19:44.224
-I don't feel very good about it at all.
-[man] Whoo!

19:44.308 --> 19:46.185
It's just... It's hard, man,

19:46.268 --> 19:48.353
'cause, um, I'm horny.

19:48.437 --> 19:50.022
I'm horny all the time,

19:50.314 --> 19:52.316
and I'm making bad choices,

19:52.774 --> 19:54.193
but at the end of the day,

19:54.693 --> 19:55.861
I'm not a pimp,

19:56.612 --> 19:58.071
and I don't want to be one.

19:59.406 --> 20:01.366
Boo! That sucked.

20:01.450 --> 20:03.076
I knew he wasn't a pimp.

20:03.160 --> 20:06.038
He's more of a john.
He will pay for sex in his lifetime.

20:06.121 --> 20:07.331
I truly believe that.

20:07.414 --> 20:09.708
Of course he will, and I shall be there.

20:09.791 --> 20:11.627
Yeah, me too. Wanna carpool?

20:11.710 --> 20:13.879
Dad, what is this place?

20:13.962 --> 20:15.672
It's Guy Town,

20:15.756 --> 20:19.218
-and you must be Greg's ex. My, my.
-This is my daughter.

20:19.301 --> 20:21.386
Your daughter's an eight
for the figure alone.

20:21.470 --> 20:23.263
-What the fuck?
-Okay, that's it!

20:23.347 --> 20:25.557
I might deserve this shithole,
but she doesn't.

20:25.641 --> 20:28.393
Guy, I'm sorry,
but you gotta let me out of my lease.

20:28.477 --> 20:30.229
[laughs] Oh, Greg,

20:30.312 --> 20:31.730
no one leaves Guy Town.

20:31.813 --> 20:33.106
-[explosion]
-[screams]

20:34.024 --> 20:35.442
-Oh, shit!
-Is he okay?

20:35.525 --> 20:38.278
He's not breathing. We need a doctor.

20:38.362 --> 20:39.905
I've got a doctor...

20:39.988 --> 20:43.200
Dre signed basketball
in the trunk of my car.

20:43.283 --> 20:44.701
Just kidding. I wish.

20:44.785 --> 20:46.787
What I do have is a nurse...

20:46.870 --> 20:49.039
Jackie signed T-shirt, so...

20:49.122 --> 20:50.249
Over here!

20:50.332 --> 20:51.792
I'm a doctor.

20:51.875 --> 20:53.710
[panting]

20:53.794 --> 20:54.670
[meows]

20:59.091 --> 21:01.218
My dad's kind of a badass.

21:01.301 --> 21:05.305
Yeah, your little kitty daddy
is a tiger mommy.

21:06.515 --> 21:07.432
[screaming]

21:08.183 --> 21:09.685
Oh! Hello.

21:09.810 --> 21:11.645
Everyone, he's going to be okay!

21:12.646 --> 21:15.482
Dad! That was amazing.
You're like a hero.

21:15.565 --> 21:19.820
I guess this pussy is pretty good
at meowth to meowth resuscitation.

21:19.903 --> 21:21.321
-Okay.
-Meowth.

21:21.405 --> 21:23.365
Look, I don't care if I signed a lease.

21:23.448 --> 21:25.826
I won't have
my daughter spend another minute

21:25.909 --> 21:27.452
in this electrical deathtrap!

21:27.536 --> 21:28.745
You listen to me, Bilzerian.

21:28.829 --> 21:31.081
We'll get the city council
to shut this place down!

21:31.164 --> 21:33.542
Good luck.
I've bribed half the city council,

21:33.625 --> 21:35.002
and blackmailed the other half.

21:35.085 --> 21:37.879
We just got you saying
all that Scooby-Doo stuff on tape.

21:37.963 --> 21:39.881
It's not on tape. It's a memory card.

21:39.965 --> 21:41.341
Give me that camera!

21:41.425 --> 21:43.844
This camera belongs to the AV Club!

21:43.927 --> 21:45.554
[Guy screams]

21:45.637 --> 21:47.347
Oh, no! My hair!

21:47.431 --> 21:49.975
No, no, no! Don't look! Don't!
Look away! Look away!

21:50.058 --> 21:51.518
Pimp of the Month.

21:51.601 --> 21:54.271
[Guy] I think I can feel the penis worms
going up my dick hole.

21:54.354 --> 21:57.607
I can feel them devouring my cock!

21:58.275 --> 21:59.943
Hey, um...

22:00.027 --> 22:01.028
are you okay?

22:01.111 --> 22:04.364
I just ordered a Hawaiian pizza
from Little Caesars.

22:04.448 --> 22:05.407
What does that tell you?

22:05.490 --> 22:06.450
[chuckles]

22:06.533 --> 22:08.285
I'm sorry if I was rude before.

22:08.368 --> 22:11.204
Yeah, well,
I probably owe you an apology, too.

22:11.288 --> 22:13.707
I shouldn't be picking fights
with little kids.

22:13.790 --> 22:15.375
That's probably a good policy.

22:15.459 --> 22:17.753
What can I say? I've got issues,

22:17.836 --> 22:19.880
and I guess I saw
a little bit of myself in you.

22:19.963 --> 22:22.466
[stammers]
I would never wear a kimono.

22:22.549 --> 22:24.760
Okay, right there.
That's what I'm talking about.

22:24.843 --> 22:26.887
You don't have to be
a little prick all the time.

22:26.970 --> 22:28.930
You can let your guard down
once in awhile.

22:29.014 --> 22:30.557
And what? Be nice?

22:30.640 --> 22:33.894
Wouldn't kill ya.
You know, I wish I was a little nicer.

22:33.977 --> 22:35.395
I might not have ended up here.

22:35.479 --> 22:37.397
How did you end up in Guy Town?

22:37.481 --> 22:41.026
You're in luck, kid.
I've written a one-man musical about it.

22:41.109 --> 22:42.027
Sit down!

22:42.110 --> 22:45.113
We open on Stonewall, 1969.

22:45.197 --> 22:46.948
-A minimal set.
-Oh, shit.

22:47.032 --> 22:49.034
-What's that now?
-I can't wait!

22:49.117 --> 22:51.495
I need to be home in 17 minutes.

22:51.578 --> 22:54.915
-[Marty grunts]
-So, kiddo, what's going on with Gina?

22:54.998 --> 22:57.250
-Uhh... I think I'm just gonna give up.
-Give up?

22:57.376 --> 22:58.627
But you really like her.

22:58.710 --> 23:00.629
Yeah, but I don't know how to ask her out.

23:00.712 --> 23:03.048
That's the stupidest thing
I've ever heard.

23:03.131 --> 23:05.467
Just do what you like to do
and bring her along.

23:05.550 --> 23:08.428
-Well, I like go-karts.
-That's a terrible interest!

23:09.679 --> 23:12.349
Nicky, why don't you invite Gina
to do go-karts?

23:12.432 --> 23:14.309
-[honks]
-Come on, Greg! Let's go!

23:14.393 --> 23:16.645
What's your hurry? I don't know
where I'm sleeping tonight.

23:16.728 --> 23:18.522
I've got three words for you:

23:18.605 --> 23:21.900
Be my roommate
in the storage unit where I live,

23:21.983 --> 23:25.404
which is on the diaper barge, Greg.

23:25.779 --> 23:27.614
This is Guy Town.

23:27.697 --> 23:32.160
I originally came here to do a story
about a lumpy gourd of a boy,

23:32.244 --> 23:36.373
but I ended up learning a few things
about what it means to be a man.

23:36.915 --> 23:40.627
[Matthew] Sometimes being a man means
putting the people you love first,

23:41.002 --> 23:43.630
and sometimes it means
owning up to your mistakes.

23:43.713 --> 23:45.215
Go away, Andrew!

23:45.298 --> 23:47.050
I just want to say that I'm sorry.

23:47.134 --> 23:48.552
Get out of here and never come back,

23:48.635 --> 23:51.638
like every single one
of my pageant coaches.

23:52.514 --> 23:54.933
[Matthew]
Not all men value the same things,

23:55.475 --> 23:58.520
and that means
you can be any man you want.

To Diaper Island, of course.

Good night, Greg!
