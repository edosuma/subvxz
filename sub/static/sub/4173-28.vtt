01:10.838 --> 01:12.838
Oh, come on, Candace.
You're overthinking this.

Jeremy will love

What's your worry?

01:15.076 --> 01:18.977
I just wanna do something

It's Jeremy's birthday

02:03.156 --> 02:05.124

02:06.961 --> 02:09.228
and well, all I have
is this scrapbook
and I don't wanna blow it.

02:09.230 --> 02:11.296

help me, huh?

02:11.298 --> 02:14.900

get together and make fun

(SCOFFS)

02:39.960 --> 02:44.062
Anyway, Agent P,
when we went to rent tonight's
horrific horror classic,

02:44.064 --> 02:47.132
Night of the Living Torso,
<i>it was already gone.</i>

02:47.134 --> 02:49.835
<i>In fact, all the movies</i>
<i>within the horror genre</i>

02:49.837 --> 02:51.770
<i>throughout Danville</i>
<i>have been checked out!</i>

02:51.772 --> 02:55.140
<i>Which is definitely a bummer</i>
<i>and could possibly be evil.</i>

02:55.142 --> 02:58.076
Go check on Doof and
see if he's bogarting
those movies.

02:58.278 --> 03:00.879
<i>Uh, before 6:30,</i>
<i>if possible.</i>

03:02.248 --> 03:04.149
Candace,
I'm headed out.
Okay, Mom.

03:04.151 --> 03:06.919
What's with
the box?
Oh, uh, nothing.

03:06.921 --> 03:10.022
I just wanted to see
what this stuff
looked like outside.

03:10.024 --> 03:12.224
Candace, is this a ploy
to get me to go outside

03:12.226 --> 03:13.692
to see what the boys
are up to?

03:13.694 --> 03:15.127
No! Er,
I mean, no need.

03:15.129 --> 03:16.962
Just go, and, uh,
feel free to stay
out for a while.

03:16.964 --> 03:18.263
Stay out all
afternoon in fact.

03:18.265 --> 03:20.432

Nice try, hon.

03:20.434 --> 03:22.134
I'm glad to see
you changing it up.

03:22.136 --> 03:23.234
See you later.
Okay, bye.

03:25.038 --> 03:27.039
So, here's all
the Jerem-obilia
I could find.

03:27.041 --> 03:28.440
Now, what?
Cool.

03:28.442 --> 03:30.142
Now, just go around town
and take pictures

03:30.144 --> 03:33.045
of all the Jeremy related
places and things you can.

03:33.047 --> 03:34.846
The camera will transmit
them back to us

03:34.848 --> 03:38.250
to incorporate into
our Mega Interactive
Scrapbook-aganza.

03:38.252 --> 03:41.086
No problemo.
Candace is on
field duty. Peace!

03:41.321 --> 03:43.021
I'm sorry.

04:06.479 --> 04:07.980
What?

04:10.083 --> 04:13.218
Oh, yeah, I guess from
your point of view it's
a little difficult to see.

04:13.220 --> 04:15.821
Let me just get this
out of the way for you.
Here we go.

04:16.189 --> 04:18.323
Now, in my never-ending
pursuit of domination,

04:18.325 --> 04:22.961
I discovered that the
best evil rulers used fear
to keep people in line.

04:22.963 --> 04:23.961
So to get in
the right headspace,

04:23.963 --> 04:26.498
I did what any logical
evil scientist would do.

04:26.500 --> 04:29.368
Rented all the scary movies
in Danville for research,

04:29.370 --> 04:32.304
even the lousy ones
like   <i>Dead Batteries.</i>

04:32.306 --> 04:35.340
Which is actually better
than its prequel,
<i>Batteries that Work,</i>

04:35.342 --> 04:41.113
which was just a bunch of
portable electronic devices
functioning properly.

04:41.115 --> 04:43.515
Once I was terrified,
I was able to analyze

04:43.517 --> 04:45.784
<i>the fear-based synapses</i>
<i>of the brain</i>

04:45.786 --> 04:47.853
<i>and extrapolate</i>
<i>some wonderful data.</i>

04:48.154 --> 04:50.188
Basically,
I shoot someone
with the machine

04:50.190 --> 04:53.225
and whatever they're
afraid of actually
appears in real life!

04:53.559 --> 04:55.060
What do ya say,
Perry the Platypus?

04:55.062 --> 04:56.060
You like being
a guinea pig?

04:56.062 --> 04:58.130
Actually, you'd
look kinda cute
as a guinea pig.

04:58.132 --> 05:00.599
I wonder if
you'd be teal.
I bet you would.

05:00.601 --> 05:03.368
I bet you'd be
a cute little
teal guinea pig.

05:03.370 --> 05:04.803
Something to think
about for the future.

05:04.805 --> 05:08.140
Anyway, Perry the Platypus,
let's fire this baby up
and see what scares you.

05:09.442 --> 05:10.075
Because you know,
it's going to materialize
right over there.

05:14.113 --> 05:16.481
All right, so what
are you afraid of?
Where is it?

You're right.

05:44.310 --> 05:45.009
Ooh, score!

05:45.011 --> 05:47.779

is the same color

05:47.880 --> 05:49.214

he gave me on
our third date!

05:55.321 --> 05:56.555

a blank.

05:58.559 --> 06:00.125
Daffodil.
Third date.

06:00.326 --> 06:03.295
Right. Now the machine
will take the images

06:03.297 --> 06:05.997
and print them in
a giant, scaled-up form.

06:08.201 --> 06:10.202
Nice touch.
Smells like
my grandma.

your grandma smelled
like ant pheromones.

06:12.572 --> 06:13.571
No, that's
the other one.

06:13.573 --> 06:16.908

else? Ah!

prefers it with a
little more cinnamon.

06:31.291 --> 06:33.058
I gotta make a note
of that for the boys.

09:33.539 --> 09:34.839
Well, Candace?

09:34.841 --> 09:36.274
Do you think
Jeremy will like it?

09:36.642 --> 09:39.377
Yeah, I just have
a few notes here.

09:39.379 --> 09:42.080
It's perfect!
I love it, guys!

09:42.082 --> 09:43.214
I love it, love it,
love it, I love it...

09:43.216 --> 09:45.183
She had me
at smiley face.

09:45.518 --> 09:47.586
Perry the Platypus!
You're back!

09:47.588 --> 09:50.255
I am never setting
that puppy off again.

09:51.157 --> 09:52.324
Oops!

09:52.725 --> 09:54.526
It's really perfect.

09:54.528 --> 09:56.828
I'm glad Mom's
gone for the day,
'cause my biggest fear

09:56.830 --> 09:59.130
is that this is just
gonna fly away before
Jeremy gets here.

09:59.132 --> 10:01.466
(CAR HORN HONKS)
(GASPS) And there he is.
Whoo-hoo!

10:01.701 --> 10:05.103
Uh, did anyone else
see that weird green beam?

10:05.105 --> 10:06.438
I wasn't gonna
mention it.

10:06.606 --> 10:09.608
Jeremy! Jeremy! Jeremy!
Jeremy! Jeremy! Jeremy!

10:09.610 --> 10:11.710
You gotta see
what the boys built
in the backyard.

10:16.248 --> 10:19.117
No, no, no!
No! No!

10:19.119 --> 10:20.585
It's gone!

10:20.820 --> 10:24.656
My worst fear
has come true.
I totally blew it.

10:24.658 --> 10:25.790
Let me guess.

10:25.792 --> 10:27.459
You had your brothers
build me something

10:27.461 --> 10:29.227
super cool
for my birthday

10:29.229 --> 10:31.262
and now it disappeared.
It's okay, I get it.

10:31.264 --> 10:33.131
We don't have
the invention
anymore,

10:33.133 --> 10:34.666
but here's
what we used
as a blueprint.

10:34.668 --> 10:36.434
Candace designed
it herself.

10:38.471 --> 10:41.406
<i>♪ It's a regular-sized</i>
<i>scrapbook</i>

10:41.408 --> 10:45.176
<i>♪ And it's all about you</i>

10:45.178 --> 10:49.514
<i>♪ And it's all about you</i>

10:50.383 --> 10:53.251
Oops! I really
meant to hit the
self-destruct button.

10:53.253 --> 10:54.753
I'll just get
this for you.

10:56.288 --> 10:59.491
Uh, so, uh,
do you need your
parking validated...

10:59.493 --> 11:01.426
Oh, oh, you found
a spot on the street!

11:01.428 --> 11:02.126
Ah, lucky you.

11:02.128 --> 11:06.164
Curse you,
Perry the Platypus
and all that. You know.

11:06.298 --> 11:09.367
Isabella, you've been
awfully quiet all day.

11:12.171 --> 11:15.173
I have just
earned my 24 hours
of silence patch.

11:15.175 --> 11:16.908
I can see
why you don't
talk much, Ferb.

11:16.910 --> 11:18.677
I actually quite
enjoyed it.

11:18.679 --> 11:21.279
I ended up having
an inner dialogue
with myself all day.

11:21.281 --> 11:22.614
Welcome to
Ferb Land.

11:23.249 --> 11:26.184
Yes, but the universe
is constantly expanding.

11:26.186 --> 11:28.219
Then, what is it
expanding into?

11:28.221 --> 11:29.654
ALL: Ooh!

11:29.656 --> 11:31.389
Okay, now my mind
is blown.
