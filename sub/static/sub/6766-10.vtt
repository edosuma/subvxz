WEBVTT

00:02.235 --> 00:04.169
This must be weird for you.

00:04.204 --> 00:07.173
I mean, watching Dylan go
through this with someone else.

00:07.207 --> 00:08.504
Actually, it's kind of a relief.

00:08.541 --> 00:09.872
Now I know he's gonna be okay.

00:09.909 --> 00:11.604
I don't have to worry
about him anymore

00:11.644 --> 00:12.702
because he has somebody.

00:12.746 --> 00:13.872
You think they're gonna make it?

00:13.913 --> 00:14.971
I hope so.

00:15.048 --> 00:16.140
For both of them.

00:16.181 --> 00:17.877
She seems as lonely as he is.

00:17.917 --> 00:19.077
You're right.

00:19.119 --> 00:20.518
You know, I mean,
we've only known Toni

00:20.553 --> 00:21.986
for what, a couple of months?

00:22.055 --> 00:24.080
And here we're here helping
her pick out her wedding gown

00:24.124 --> 00:25.523
and planning her
bachelorette party.

00:25.558 --> 00:29.221
Well, I think we will all know
Toni a lot better after tonight.

00:29.262 --> 00:30.991
It's hard not to like her.
I mean, she's so sweet.

00:31.064 --> 00:32.656
And beautiful.

00:32.698 --> 00:33.961
It fits.

00:34.000 --> 00:35.831
I can't believe they
got it done so quickly.

00:35.869 --> 00:37.996
- You are going to be a beautiful
bride. - Thank you.

00:38.038 --> 00:39.835
I hope you guys don't mind
not coming to the wedding.

00:39.873 --> 00:41.238
But Dylan wanted it
to be private.

00:41.274 --> 00:42.707
That's Dylan.

00:42.742 --> 00:44.642
And we will all be
there at the reception.

00:44.677 --> 00:46.542
And for the rest of our lives.

00:46.579 --> 00:47.603
Let's go.

00:49.000 --> 00:55.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:56.990 --> 00:59.424
You rang?

00:59.459 --> 01:01.222
Everything taken care of?

01:01.261 --> 01:02.319
All set.

01:02.362 --> 01:04.193
I've got two
of my best men on it.

01:04.230 --> 01:05.288
It'll look like

01:05.331 --> 01:06.958
a break-in burglary
and the McKay kid

01:07.067 --> 01:09.627
was just stupid
and got in the way.

01:09.669 --> 01:12.729
Just make sure your daughter's
out of his house by 5:30.

01:12.772 --> 01:15.764
I don't want to hear another
word about this until it's done.

01:15.809 --> 01:16.969
You understand?

01:17.010 --> 01:18.602
You got it.

03:21.100 --> 03:22.761
Hello, lovebird.

03:22.802 --> 03:24.497
Hey, guys,
what are you doing here?

03:24.537 --> 03:26.505
Well, there's
a kidnapping going on.

03:26.539 --> 03:27.528
And you guys are the victims.

03:27.574 --> 03:28.598
That's right, Dylan,

03:28.641 --> 03:29.869
you're going to your own
bachelor party.

03:29.909 --> 03:31.968
And you're coming with us,
the bachelorettes.

03:32.045 --> 03:33.069
Wait a minute.
We've got...

03:33.112 --> 03:34.875
We've got a lot to do tonight.

03:34.914 --> 03:36.245
No. No arguing.

03:36.282 --> 03:37.249
It's a kidnapping, remember?

03:37.283 --> 03:38.614
Besides, it's bad luck

03:38.651 --> 03:40.118
to spend the last night
before your wedding together.

03:40.153 --> 03:41.415
You guys will probably
fight anyways.

03:41.454 --> 03:43.115
I'm going with them.
You do what you want.

03:43.156 --> 03:44.180
What about your father?

03:44.224 --> 03:45.282
It's a kidnapping.
You heard them.

03:45.325 --> 03:47.190
I'm sure he'll understand.
Bye!

03:47.227 --> 03:48.285
See you later!

03:48.328 --> 03:49.386
You heard the lady.

03:49.429 --> 03:51.556
Boy, do we have an evening
planned for you.

03:52.832 --> 03:54.459
I got a bottle of scotch
that's been nesting

03:54.500 --> 03:55.933
since before we were born.

03:55.969 --> 03:58.267
Is that the kid?

03:58.304 --> 03:59.271
Yeah.

03:59.305 --> 04:00.533
What the hell is this?

04:00.573 --> 04:02.234
Guess no one told him

04:02.275 --> 04:03.469
he was supposed
to get bumped off.

04:03.509 --> 04:04.874
So much for the best laid plans.

04:04.911 --> 04:06.742
Yeah.
Hey, I'll flip you

04:06.779 --> 04:07.871
for who's got to call Marchette.

04:14.988 --> 04:18.719
And a little iced tea
for our friend over here.

04:18.757 --> 04:21.784
Don't worry, it still
looks like the real stuff.

04:21.827 --> 04:23.352
I'd like to make
the first toast.

04:23.396 --> 04:25.296
- Yes, sir, go ahead.
- Thank you. Dylan,

04:25.331 --> 04:27.094
one of us had to go down first

04:27.133 --> 04:29.294
and I for one am glad it's you.

04:29.335 --> 04:30.927
At least it gives the rest of us

04:30.970 --> 04:32.437
mortals a chance with the women,
right, guys?

04:32.472 --> 04:33.871
- Absolutely.
- Sure.

04:33.906 --> 04:35.168
In all seriousness,

04:35.208 --> 04:37.540
Dylan, we've been buddies
since kindergarten.

04:37.577 --> 04:39.670
All the years I've known you,

04:39.712 --> 04:40.906
this is actually the first time

04:40.947 --> 04:42.812
I've ever seen you look happy.

04:46.219 --> 04:48.653
May the long road of marriage
treat you well, my friend.

04:51.024 --> 04:52.184
Nostro <i>v</i> ia.

04:53.726 --> 04:54.693
Chi <i>n</i>- chi <i>n</i>.

04:54.727 --> 04:56.194
Cheers.

04:58.665 --> 04:59.654
Mmm!

05:00.733 --> 05:02.166
That's good.

05:02.201 --> 05:04.931
I had some crazy things planned
for this bachelor party.

05:04.971 --> 05:07.269
I had these two twins,
Georgia and Georgette...

05:07.307 --> 05:08.774
- Oh, yeah?
- the things they could do

05:08.808 --> 05:11.470
with a feed bag and a farm
animal... incredible.

05:11.511 --> 05:13.274
Sounds great, Steve,
but you must have me mistaken

05:13.313 --> 05:14.712
for some other bachelor.

05:14.747 --> 05:16.305
Well, that's okay,
'cause Walsh nixed the plans

05:16.349 --> 05:18.214
- when he saw the Polaroids.
- Hey, the only reason

05:18.251 --> 05:19.309
I ixnayed all that stuff

05:19.352 --> 05:21.320
is because our
good buddy Dylan here

05:21.354 --> 05:23.083
has done everything.
Twice.

05:23.122 --> 05:25.784
So, would you guys
shut up and deal the cards?

05:25.825 --> 05:26.917
Never in one night.

05:26.959 --> 05:28.790
I wonder what the chicks
are doing right now?

05:28.828 --> 05:30.955
Well, they're probably on
their third cup of Sleepytime,

05:31.030 --> 05:33.555
discussing the value
of Oriental fabrics.

05:35.101 --> 05:36.398
Whoo...!

05:42.475 --> 05:44.568
This is so much fun, you guys!

05:44.610 --> 05:45.770
Whoo-hoo!

05:45.812 --> 05:47.837
Too bad Valerie had
to leave to go to work.

05:47.880 --> 05:50.474
Oh, don't worry,
she hand-picked them.

05:50.516 --> 05:53.144
Okay, guys, Davidoffs,
the best, take one.

05:53.186 --> 05:55.552
I've never smoked a cigar
before.

05:55.588 --> 05:56.987
Uh, hand one of those to me.

05:57.023 --> 05:59.617
I was trying to light
the stupid thing.

06:04.197 --> 06:05.357
Got it?

06:05.398 --> 06:06.888
Got it.

06:06.933 --> 06:08.901
Donna, if your mom
could see you now.

06:10.403 --> 06:13.930
Why, why do you have to bring
my mom up at a time like this,

06:13.973 --> 06:15.031
when I'm having fun?

06:15.074 --> 06:16.302
Are you trying
to ruin something?

06:16.342 --> 06:17.639
What's the deal
with your mom, anyway?

06:17.677 --> 06:19.269
What was that picture
you saw of her?

06:19.312 --> 06:20.404
I don't know.

06:20.446 --> 06:22.380
I don't even really
want to know.

06:22.415 --> 06:24.383
I'm just glad
that she's in Europe.

06:24.417 --> 06:27.580
And let's talk about
something else, baby!

06:32.625 --> 06:34.058
Okay, pass the champagne.

06:34.093 --> 06:35.390
Yeah.

06:35.428 --> 06:37.259
I've got to tell you guys,

06:37.296 --> 06:38.957
I am having a fabulous time.

06:38.998 --> 06:40.056
And guys think they have

06:40.099 --> 06:42.124
the market cornered
on a good stripper

06:42.168 --> 06:43.192
and a good cigar.

06:43.236 --> 06:45.136
We've come a long way, girls.

06:46.506 --> 06:48.770
Whoo-hoo!

06:50.877 --> 06:52.970
No...!

06:59.051 --> 07:00.348
Yeah?

07:00.386 --> 07:01.910
There's a problem. He, uh...

07:01.988 --> 07:03.455
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

07:03.489 --> 07:05.923
What do you mean,
there's a problem?

07:06.025 --> 07:07.515
He took off with his friends.

07:07.560 --> 07:09.721
Well, I trusted you to take care
of this, Ronnie.

07:09.762 --> 07:12.560
If you can't take care of this,
I'll get someone who can.

07:12.598 --> 07:13.860
I'll take care of it.

07:13.900 --> 07:15.333
Don't you knock?

07:15.368 --> 07:16.801
Sorry.

07:18.104 --> 07:19.503
Where's Toni?

07:19.539 --> 07:22.064
- She was supposed to be here
an hour ago. - She called.

07:22.108 --> 07:23.769
A bunch of her friends came by

07:23.810 --> 07:25.175
and took her
to a bachelorette party.

07:25.211 --> 07:26.337
You know how kids are.

07:26.379 --> 07:28.609
Yeah, fine.

07:28.648 --> 07:30.309
Listen, if it's okay with you,

07:30.349 --> 07:31.714
I told Toni I'd pick her up

07:31.751 --> 07:34.345
and drive her
to the wedding tomorrow.

07:34.387 --> 07:35.854
Fine, fine.

07:35.888 --> 07:37.219
We got a big day tomorrow.

07:37.256 --> 07:39.486
Gonna watch our
little girl get married.

07:39.525 --> 07:40.549
Who'd have thought, huh?

07:40.593 --> 07:42.390
Yeah.

07:42.428 --> 07:43.861
Big day.

07:46.232 --> 07:48.462
Good night, Bruno.

07:48.501 --> 07:50.969
Good night, boss.

08:00.213 --> 08:05.412
All right, one more hand,
for your bike.

08:07.353 --> 08:10.049
Okay, you're on.

08:11.524 --> 08:13.924
I still can't believe it, man.

08:14.026 --> 08:15.357
You getting married.

08:15.394 --> 08:18.090
You better get used to it,
Brando.

08:18.130 --> 08:19.893
I got a new life.

08:21.300 --> 08:22.665
What about the old man?

08:22.702 --> 08:24.226
Is he gonna live with this?

08:24.270 --> 08:27.205
To tell you the truth,
I don't care about the old man.

08:27.240 --> 08:28.502
I never will.

08:28.541 --> 08:30.600
Then you'd better hope
he dies young.

08:30.643 --> 08:32.474
Thought crossed my mind.

08:35.681 --> 08:38.047
If I were you,
I'd stop thinking like that.

08:39.519 --> 08:43.216
And in case you're having
any second thoughts,

08:43.256 --> 08:45.053
I never met a woman in my life

08:45.091 --> 08:47.651
more worth it
than your future wife.

08:51.697 --> 08:53.665
I hear you loud and clear.

08:56.936 --> 08:58.096
Gin.

08:59.906 --> 09:01.897
I guess that means
you get to keep your bike.

09:01.974 --> 09:04.602
I guess.

09:06.712 --> 09:09.306
You're the best friend
I ever had, Brandon.

09:12.485 --> 09:14.282
Thanks.

09:23.529 --> 09:25.463
Clare, will you get
the extra blankets?

09:25.498 --> 09:27.796
Looks like everyone's
sleeping here.

09:27.833 --> 09:29.391
All right, I'm on it.

09:33.105 --> 09:35.130
I told Bruno to pick me up
in the morning.

09:35.174 --> 09:37.199
Thank you so much
for letting me stay.

09:37.243 --> 09:38.437
Mm, no problem.

09:38.477 --> 09:40.206
You plan on getting
dressed here anyway.

09:42.148 --> 09:43.376
Who in God's name is that?

09:43.416 --> 09:44.678
I got it.

09:47.219 --> 09:48.243
Hey.

09:48.287 --> 09:50.255
I saw the lights still on.

09:50.289 --> 09:54.089
Um, you're not really
welcome here anymore, Ray.

09:54.126 --> 09:55.957
Sorry, you'd better go.

09:57.597 --> 09:59.792
Donna, please. I need to talk.

10:02.969 --> 10:04.493
So talk.

10:04.537 --> 10:06.368
It's okay.

10:06.405 --> 10:07.929
Okay, I'm gonna go to bed.

10:07.974 --> 10:09.771
Me, too.

10:09.809 --> 10:11.868
Good night.

10:13.212 --> 10:15.806
Look, I've been
in therapy twice a week.

10:15.848 --> 10:17.315
Good.
You need it.

10:17.350 --> 10:19.079
Put yourself
in my shoes, all right?

10:19.118 --> 10:20.278
I miss you.

10:20.319 --> 10:21.411
I miss your friends.

10:21.454 --> 10:23.115
You miss my friends?

10:23.155 --> 10:24.520
Ray, the whole time
we were together,

10:24.557 --> 10:26.582
all I ever heard is how much
you hated my friends.

10:26.626 --> 10:27.593
Now you love them?

10:27.627 --> 10:28.992
Look, I know I was selfish,

10:29.028 --> 10:30.893
but I do not deserve this.

10:30.930 --> 10:32.761
Look, if you'll excuse me,

10:32.798 --> 10:34.356
I have to get back
to my guests.

10:34.400 --> 10:35.560
Can I just come in
for a minute, please?

10:35.601 --> 10:37.569
I need to spend
some time with you.

10:37.603 --> 10:39.594
Do you want me to slam
the door in your face?

10:39.639 --> 10:40.606
Because I will.

10:40.640 --> 10:42.437
Fine.

10:42.475 --> 10:43.999
But I'm not giving up, Donna.

10:44.076 --> 10:46.010
You're either gonna
start listening to me,

10:46.112 --> 10:47.977
or I'm going to make
your life miserable.

10:56.322 --> 10:57.346
I'm going to bed.

10:57.390 --> 10:59.415
- Are you okay?
- You know, Kel,

10:59.458 --> 11:00.720
I have been listening to him

11:00.760 --> 11:03.854
sing the same tune
for weeks now.

11:03.896 --> 11:05.955
I'm used to it.

11:06.032 --> 11:07.056
Good night, Donna.

11:07.099 --> 11:08.396
Good night.

11:08.434 --> 11:10.265
What was that all about?

11:10.302 --> 11:11.701
Don't ask.

11:11.737 --> 11:13.534
Love gone wrong?

11:13.572 --> 11:14.698
Something like that.

11:14.740 --> 11:16.367
Thank you for tonight.

11:16.409 --> 11:17.967
It's something that
I'll always remember.

11:18.077 --> 11:19.567
We all had a good time.

11:21.547 --> 11:24.072
Kelly, listen, I know that Dylan

11:24.116 --> 11:26.141
doesn't have very many
connections in his life.

11:26.185 --> 11:28.210
Barely any family to speak of.

11:28.254 --> 11:30.347
Which, unfortunately,
is something

11:30.389 --> 11:31.856
that we have in common.

11:31.891 --> 11:33.586
I don't have very
much family either.

11:33.626 --> 11:35.526
Well, you do now.

11:35.561 --> 11:37.893
We're all Dylan's family
and now we're yours.

11:37.930 --> 11:39.522
Thanks.

11:39.565 --> 11:40.793
That means a lot to me.

11:42.168 --> 11:45.137
Toni...

11:45.171 --> 11:48.436
Brandon told me
about your father and Jack.

11:48.474 --> 11:51.602
I'm glad that you both know.

11:51.644 --> 11:55.944
Can I give you
some sisterly advice?

11:55.981 --> 11:57.471
Sure.

11:57.516 --> 12:00.610
Get as far away from here
as you can.

12:00.653 --> 12:04.714
Yeah.
That's pretty much the idea.

12:04.757 --> 12:08.318
Give me a hug.

12:08.360 --> 12:10.658
Everything will be okay.

12:10.696 --> 12:13.494
Just go. Don't look back.

12:13.532 --> 12:16.695
Thank you for everything.

12:16.736 --> 12:18.169
You're welcome.

12:18.204 --> 12:20.968
Now go get some sleep.
You're getting married tomorrow.

12:21.040 --> 12:22.837
Yes, I am.

12:22.875 --> 12:24.502
Good night.

12:35.821 --> 12:39.723
"January 10, 1975."
That's my birthday.

12:39.759 --> 12:41.386
"Dear Antonia,

12:41.427 --> 12:43.918
"This Bible has been
in our family for a long time.

12:43.963 --> 12:46.898
"It was carried down the aisle
by me, my mother

12:46.932 --> 12:48.160
"and her mother before that.

12:48.200 --> 12:50.998
"Next it will be your turn.

12:51.036 --> 12:53.664
Happy birthday. Love, Mother."

12:53.706 --> 12:55.105
That's beautiful.

12:55.141 --> 12:59.840
Yeah. I wish she could
be here right now,

12:59.879 --> 13:01.779
but I'm sure glad
that I have this.

13:01.814 --> 13:03.679
Well, you have something old.

13:03.716 --> 13:06.947
And now... here.

13:07.052 --> 13:08.485
Oh!

13:08.521 --> 13:10.489
Something new.

13:10.523 --> 13:12.650
Oh, these are beautiful!
Thanks.

13:12.691 --> 13:14.090
It's from all of us.

13:14.126 --> 13:16.321
Mmm! Smell.

13:16.362 --> 13:18.956
Now for something borrowed.

13:19.064 --> 13:21.259
I got it on my first Communion.

13:21.300 --> 13:25.498
Donna, these are precious.
Thank you.

13:25.538 --> 13:27.506
You're welcome.

13:27.540 --> 13:29.804
And last but not least.

13:29.842 --> 13:31.309
Oh, no.

13:31.343 --> 13:32.401
Ta-dah!

13:32.444 --> 13:33.741
Oh!

13:33.779 --> 13:34.803
You guys.

13:34.847 --> 13:36.678
Okay, here I go.

13:36.715 --> 13:38.410
What do you think?

13:38.450 --> 13:39.974
It fits.

13:40.052 --> 13:41.917
You're all set.

13:41.954 --> 13:43.353
Yeah, I guess I am,
except you guys have

13:43.389 --> 13:44.720
to help me with my veil
after I get dressed?

13:44.757 --> 13:46.850
Okay. All right.

13:46.892 --> 13:48.382
- We'll put this away.
- All right.

13:52.398 --> 13:54.457
Hey, buddy.
How you doing?

13:54.500 --> 13:55.694
Oh, a little shaky.

13:55.734 --> 13:56.826
What's that?

13:56.869 --> 13:59.337
Telegram. Jim and Cindy
sent it from Hong Kong.

13:59.371 --> 14:00.861
You want I should read it?

14:00.906 --> 14:03.704
Yeah. Go ahead. Go ahead.

14:03.742 --> 14:06.142
"Dear Dylan,
We couldn't be more proud

14:06.178 --> 14:08.203
"if our own son
was getting married.

14:08.247 --> 14:09.908
"We can't wait
to meet your new bride.

14:09.949 --> 14:13.544
Have a wonderful life together.
Love, Jim and Cindy."

14:13.586 --> 14:17.249
You know they're just glad I'm
not marrying Brenda, don't you?

14:17.289 --> 14:19.883
Speaking of Brenda, I've got one
here from jolly olde England.

14:19.925 --> 14:21.222
You want to hear it?

14:21.260 --> 14:23.626
Sure. Why not? Hey.

14:23.662 --> 14:25.129
The one you have on.

14:25.164 --> 14:26.495
"Dear Dylan,

14:26.532 --> 14:28.830
"She must be something
to get a ring on your finger.

14:28.868 --> 14:30.631
"I guess this settles

14:30.669 --> 14:32.899
"the Brenda-Kelly issue
once and for all.

14:32.938 --> 14:35.133
"Sorry I can't be
there for your big day,

14:35.174 --> 14:37.540
"but I want you to know,
even with an ocean between us,

14:37.576 --> 14:39.441
"I will always love you.

14:39.478 --> 14:40.968
Brenda."

14:41.046 --> 14:46.074
Well, I appreciate you
telling her for me, Brandon.

14:46.118 --> 14:48.951
I don't think
I could have done it.

14:48.988 --> 14:50.580
Show time, buddy.

14:50.623 --> 14:52.921
Yeah. I guess this is it, huh?

14:52.958 --> 14:54.687
You know, it's not too late
to bail out on this.

14:54.727 --> 14:56.592
I do have a small jet
warming its engines

14:56.629 --> 14:57.926
on a runway in Burbank.

14:57.963 --> 14:59.794
You're very funny, Bran.

14:59.832 --> 15:01.732
Just doing my job as best man.

15:01.767 --> 15:04.258
Well, to tell you the truth,

15:04.303 --> 15:06.863
I've never felt better about
anything in my whole life.

15:06.906 --> 15:08.840
Let's go.

15:19.818 --> 15:20.944
Hello.

15:21.053 --> 15:22.816
Hi. I'm Tony Marchette.

15:22.855 --> 15:23.844
I believe my...

15:23.889 --> 15:26.380
Daddy.

15:26.425 --> 15:28.655
...my daughter is here.

15:28.694 --> 15:30.355
Excuse me.

15:35.534 --> 15:40.631
Antonia, you look beautiful.

15:40.673 --> 15:44.131
The most beautiful bride
I've ever seen.

15:44.176 --> 15:46.872
Thanks, Dad.

15:46.912 --> 15:49.346
Um... Kelly, Donna,
this is my father.

15:49.381 --> 15:50.939
- Hi.
- Hi.

15:50.983 --> 15:51.915
Nice to meet you.

15:51.951 --> 15:52.975
- Hi.
- Hello.

15:53.085 --> 15:56.145
Uh... Could you excuse us
for a minute?

15:56.188 --> 15:59.157
I'd love to talk
to my daughter alone.

15:59.191 --> 16:02.251
- All right.
- Thanks.

16:03.963 --> 16:06.625
Antonia.

16:06.665 --> 16:10.260
We need to talk, please.

16:19.878 --> 16:22.506
I don't want you to go
through with this wedding.

16:22.548 --> 16:24.948
- What?
- I'm sorry.

16:24.984 --> 16:29.387
I have to tell you what I want,
and what I know is best for you.

16:29.421 --> 16:32.117
Daddy, please.
Don't do this to me now.

16:32.157 --> 16:34.921
Do you want a lifetime
of misery? Because that's

16:34.960 --> 16:37.087
what you're going to get.

16:37.129 --> 16:39.893
I knew it was too good
to be true.

16:39.932 --> 16:41.297
Everything you said
the other day,

16:41.333 --> 16:42.630
it didn't mean anything, did it?

16:42.668 --> 16:44.295
I can't let you
go through with this.

16:44.336 --> 16:46.395
I can't let this man
take you away from me.

16:46.438 --> 16:47.928
Well, you don't have a say
in the matter.

16:51.010 --> 16:55.071
Now, I am begging you,
please accept this.

16:55.114 --> 16:57.446
This marriage was made in hell,

16:57.483 --> 17:00.782
and I will not
watch you go through with it.

17:00.819 --> 17:03.515
You have made your hell...

17:04.757 --> 17:06.849
and now you're going
to have to live in it.

17:06.892 --> 17:10.555
Antonia, please.
Don't do this to me.

17:11.130 --> 17:13.598
Please.

17:25.944 --> 17:28.640
Toni, are you okay?

17:28.680 --> 17:31.148
Yeah. I'm fine.

17:31.183 --> 17:33.447
Well, if you need anything,
we're right inside.

17:33.485 --> 17:35.578
I'll be okay. Thanks, Kelly.

17:35.621 --> 17:37.111
Excuse me.

17:37.156 --> 17:39.522
- Hi.
- I work for Mr. Marchette.

17:39.558 --> 17:42.493
- Bruno.
- Toni, I'm sorry.

17:42.528 --> 17:44.621
I tried to talk to him.
He would not listen.

17:44.663 --> 17:47.928
Oh, Bruno,
what am I going to do?

17:47.966 --> 17:51.333
Come on.

17:51.370 --> 17:52.803
Dry up.

17:52.838 --> 17:54.305
I'm walking you down that aisle.

17:54.339 --> 17:55.966
What about my father?

17:56.041 --> 17:57.872
He'll just have to catch a cab.

17:57.910 --> 18:00.208
You're the most important
thing to me right now.

18:00.245 --> 18:02.179
Thank you, Bruno.

18:08.687 --> 18:11.781
Hey, Dylan, this
is kind of embarrassing,

18:11.824 --> 18:13.519
but I've got another
service to perform

18:13.559 --> 18:16.153
on the other side of town
in about an hour, so, uh...

18:16.195 --> 18:17.992
Hold on.
Here she is.

18:23.569 --> 18:25.366
Can we get started?

18:25.404 --> 18:28.066
Absolutely.

18:56.335 --> 18:59.498
Dearly beloved,
we are gathered together here

18:59.538 --> 19:01.597
to celebrate the joining
together of these

19:01.640 --> 19:03.608
two people in holy matrimony.

19:03.642 --> 19:05.269
And what God
has brought together

19:05.310 --> 19:06.743
let no man tear asunder.

19:06.778 --> 19:08.473
Dylan, I believe
you and your bride

19:08.514 --> 19:09.845
have some words for each other.

19:15.487 --> 19:17.614
All my life,
people have told me

19:17.656 --> 19:21.023
I was running away
from something.

19:21.059 --> 19:25.189
I always felt
I was running to something.

19:25.230 --> 19:28.324
I just didn't know
what that was until now.

19:28.367 --> 19:30.562
I love you.

19:30.602 --> 19:32.365
I always will.

19:34.173 --> 19:39.110
You don't have
to run anymore, Dylan.

19:39.144 --> 19:41.374
I'm going to be with you
for the rest of your life.

19:43.015 --> 19:46.382
I love you
with all my heart and soul.

19:51.256 --> 19:52.746
Can we have the rings, please?

19:56.929 --> 19:58.396
Dylan, place the ring

19:58.430 --> 20:01.524
on your bride's hand
and repeat after me.

20:01.567 --> 20:03.501
I, Dylan Michael...

20:03.535 --> 20:05.901
I, Dylan Michael...

20:05.938 --> 20:10.568
take thee, Antonia Elizabeth,
to be my lawful wedded wife.

20:10.609 --> 20:12.804
take thee,
Antonia Elizabeth,

20:12.844 --> 20:14.709
to be my lawful wedded wife.

20:14.746 --> 20:17.112
To have and to hold,
in sickness and in health.

20:17.149 --> 20:18.514
To have and to hold,

20:18.550 --> 20:21.246
in sickness and in health,

20:21.286 --> 20:22.810
for richer, for poorer...

20:22.854 --> 20:24.253
for richer,
for poorer...

20:24.289 --> 20:25.984
till death do us part.

20:26.058 --> 20:28.492
till death
do us part.

20:28.527 --> 20:30.859
Now, Antonia, take the ring

20:30.896 --> 20:32.659
and place it
on Dylan's left hand,

20:32.698 --> 20:35.166
and repeat after me.

20:35.200 --> 20:38.499
I, Antonia Elizabeth,
take thee, Dylan Michael,

20:38.537 --> 20:40.402
to be my lawful wedded husband.

20:40.439 --> 20:42.304
I, Antonia Elizabeth,

20:42.341 --> 20:44.275
take thee,
Dylan Michael,

20:44.309 --> 20:46.504
to be my lawful
wedded husband.

20:46.545 --> 20:49.275
To have and to hold,
in sickness and in health...

20:49.314 --> 20:53.375
To have and to hold, in sickness
and in health...

20:53.418 --> 20:54.885
for richer, for poorer...

20:54.920 --> 20:56.751
for richer
or for poorer...

20:56.788 --> 20:58.380
till death do us part.

20:58.423 --> 21:01.324
till death
do us part.

21:01.360 --> 21:04.090
Now, with the power vested to me
by the state of California,

21:04.129 --> 21:06.359
and in the presence of God,

21:06.398 --> 21:09.959
I happily pronounce you
husband and wife.

21:10.035 --> 21:12.003
You may kiss the bride.

21:29.388 --> 21:32.482
Okay, as best man, it is my duty

21:32.524 --> 21:34.958
to give the bride and groom
the first toast,

21:34.993 --> 21:37.257
so here we go.

21:37.296 --> 21:40.390
Dylan, we've been through a lot
in the last five years,

21:40.432 --> 21:41.899
and I think that this is,
by far,

21:41.933 --> 21:43.491
the smartest thing
I've ever seen you do.

21:43.535 --> 21:46.993
And, Toni,
seeing you marry Dylan

21:47.072 --> 21:49.836
has filled me
with much happiness,

21:49.875 --> 21:52.173
but it has also made me
question your mental health.

21:52.210 --> 21:53.575
Oh, really?

21:54.913 --> 21:57.381
I want to thank you guys

21:57.416 --> 21:59.941
for letting me be a part
of this very special day.

21:59.985 --> 22:03.648
I wish you nothing
but love and happiness.

22:03.689 --> 22:05.657
- Chi <i>n</i>- chi <i>n</i>/
- Chi <i>n</i>- chi <i>n</i>/

22:05.691 --> 22:06.555
- Sa/ud/
- Cheers!

22:06.591 --> 22:07.751
Cheers!

22:10.228 --> 22:13.254
Okay, it's time to cut the cake.

22:13.298 --> 22:15.732
- Mrs. McKay?
- Nat, can I

22:15.767 --> 22:17.598
steal a moment with
my wife, please, first?

22:17.636 --> 22:20.070
Okay. Come on.

22:26.378 --> 22:28.972
Ah! Well...

22:29.047 --> 22:30.981
I want to know what happened
to your father this morning.

22:31.049 --> 22:32.073
Why didn't he come?

22:32.117 --> 22:35.484
He had a change of heart.

22:35.520 --> 22:37.385
He came over this morning

22:37.422 --> 22:39.219
and asked me not
to go through with it.

22:39.257 --> 22:43.284
Well, that's just
his tough luck, then.

22:43.328 --> 22:45.728
You've made me
a very happy woman.

23:02.914 --> 23:05.781
"Mr. and Mrs. McKay."

23:05.817 --> 23:08.843
- I like the sound of that.
- Me, too.

23:15.527 --> 23:16.824
Oh, that is so sweet.

23:16.862 --> 23:18.386
Yeah.

23:26.805 --> 23:28.898
Ooh.

23:30.342 --> 23:31.832
Wow.

23:31.877 --> 23:34.277
This is beautiful.

23:35.647 --> 23:37.979
You know...

23:38.083 --> 23:42.417
I haven't got to dance
with my wife yet.

23:42.454 --> 23:44.581
I'd love to.

24:27.065 --> 24:30.262
So, how does it feel watching
your best friend get married?

24:30.302 --> 24:31.462
Well, to tell you the truth,

24:31.503 --> 24:32.902
right now I'm feeling
kind of lonely.

24:32.938 --> 24:35.202
How come?

24:35.240 --> 24:39.336
Well, one by one a lot of people
that I love have moved away.

24:39.377 --> 24:42.437
First it was my sister, then
there was Andrea Zuckerman,

24:42.481 --> 24:46.110
then out of the blue,
my parents, and now Dylan.

24:46.151 --> 24:49.245
Well, I'd like to stick
around for a while,

24:49.287 --> 24:51.482
if you don't mind.

24:52.824 --> 24:55.657
Well, I don't think
I'd mind that at all.

25:00.599 --> 25:04.057
Mmm... mm, mm, mm.

25:04.102 --> 25:06.434
It's a hell of a catch, kid.

25:06.471 --> 25:08.939
What are you going
to do with it?

25:09.007 --> 25:10.474
I don't know.

25:10.509 --> 25:12.101
Maybe I should have it bronzed.

25:12.143 --> 25:15.306
You think it means anything?

25:15.347 --> 25:17.872
Yeah, maybe my luck's changing.

25:17.916 --> 25:20.180
I almost got married once.

25:20.218 --> 25:23.654
My high school sweetheart.

25:23.688 --> 25:25.121
Yeah, so, what happened?

25:25.156 --> 25:27.454
I don't know.

25:27.492 --> 25:30.757
After we graduated,
she changed that summer.

25:30.795 --> 25:33.696
She got pretty wild and started
hanging out with a crowd

25:33.732 --> 25:36.599
that I didn't see
eye to eye with.

25:36.635 --> 25:40.127
Well, I have to admit,
I'm kind of glad.

25:40.171 --> 25:42.696
Yeah.

25:42.741 --> 25:45.835
Things have a funny way
of working out for the best.

25:45.877 --> 25:46.866
Yeah.

25:54.920 --> 25:56.114
Hi.

25:56.154 --> 25:57.951
How you doin'?

25:57.989 --> 25:59.684
I'm tired.

25:59.724 --> 26:01.214
It's been one heck of a day.

26:01.259 --> 26:03.853
No, I mean seeing your old
boyfriend get married and all.

26:03.895 --> 26:06.489
I thought it was gonna be hard,

26:06.531 --> 26:09.659
but seeing
the two of them together,

26:09.701 --> 26:11.931
they're just so right
for each other.

26:12.003 --> 26:13.664
It makes me happy for them.

26:13.705 --> 26:14.899
I'm glad.

26:14.940 --> 26:17.135
I'm glad you're glad.

26:41.066 --> 26:42.556
Good morning, wife.

26:44.169 --> 26:47.138
Morning? It's 4:06
in the afternoon.

26:47.172 --> 26:50.767
I love marriage.

26:50.809 --> 26:52.868
I have no complaints either.

26:57.282 --> 26:58.977
Wow, do you hear that?

26:59.084 --> 27:01.678
It sounds like it's gonna rain.

27:01.720 --> 27:03.847
You know what, I like
to do in the rain?

27:03.888 --> 27:07.324
Uh-uh. Why don't you show me?

27:12.130 --> 27:13.222
Someone's at the door.

27:13.264 --> 27:15.289
So, ignore them,
they'll go away.

27:22.407 --> 27:24.068
I think you'd better get it.

27:24.109 --> 27:26.236
I think you're right.
Stay here.

27:37.689 --> 27:39.816
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

27:39.858 --> 27:41.519
Good afternoon, newlyweds.

27:41.559 --> 27:43.720
May we enter?

27:43.762 --> 27:45.127
If you must.

27:47.032 --> 27:49.227
You really lucked out
with the weather yesterday.

27:49.267 --> 27:51.633
It looks like it's
going to pour any minute.

27:51.670 --> 27:53.501
Here we go.

27:53.538 --> 27:55.403
Good afternoon.

27:55.440 --> 27:57.271
- Good afternoon, Mrs. McKay.
- Good afternoon.

27:57.308 --> 27:59.538
Oh, look at this. This is great.
You guys thought of everything.

27:59.577 --> 28:01.442
This is from your friends
who wish you

28:01.479 --> 28:03.208
a happy life together
and bon voyage.

28:03.248 --> 28:04.442
I'm surprised they didn't each

28:04.482 --> 28:05.676
come and present it
individually.

28:05.717 --> 28:07.651
Look at that fish.

28:07.686 --> 28:09.210
And those bagels.

28:09.254 --> 28:11.279
I can't believe the kitty
cat's not up there already.

28:11.322 --> 28:12.482
Come on, Sanders.

28:12.524 --> 28:14.651
Let's leave
these lovebirds alone.

28:14.693 --> 28:15.751
Good-bye, dear.

28:15.794 --> 28:17.955
Thank you.

28:19.364 --> 28:20.729
Give me some.

28:20.765 --> 28:23.666
- Tell everyone we said thanks,
okay? - I will, take care.

28:23.702 --> 28:25.226
You're too much, man.

28:25.270 --> 28:27.830
Good friends.

28:27.872 --> 28:29.066
- Good friends.
- Yeah.

28:31.042 --> 28:33.306
Oh, this place is busy today.

28:35.947 --> 28:37.141
Hello.

28:37.182 --> 28:38.945
May I speak with my daughter,
please.

28:38.983 --> 28:41.543
She doesn't want
to speak to you.

28:41.586 --> 28:43.451
She doesn't even want
to hear your name mentioned.

28:43.488 --> 28:44.819
I'm hanging up now.

28:44.856 --> 28:46.448
Dylan, wait, listen to me.

28:46.491 --> 28:47.788
I know you were right.

28:47.826 --> 28:51.853
This is going to take
some time to work out.

28:51.896 --> 28:52.920
We need to talk, kid.

28:52.964 --> 28:54.625
We already talked.

28:54.666 --> 28:56.327
Yeah, I know.
We need to talk again.

28:56.367 --> 28:59.928
I made a mistake yesterday.

28:59.971 --> 29:01.734
I want you to come to my office.

29:01.773 --> 29:03.434
I've got a surprise for Toni.

29:03.475 --> 29:05.534
Forget it. Your last surprise
broke her heart.

29:05.577 --> 29:07.807
Whatever you've got,
you know what to do with it.

29:07.846 --> 29:08.904
Dylan, what does he want?

29:08.980 --> 29:10.345
He wants me to come
down to his office.

29:10.381 --> 29:11.575
I'm gonna hang up on him.

29:11.616 --> 29:14.551
- Don't hang up.
- Yes!

29:14.586 --> 29:15.917
What?

29:15.987 --> 29:16.919
Dylan, he's trying.

29:17.021 --> 29:18.613
Just, just go down there.

29:18.656 --> 29:20.817
See what he wants, please.

29:25.630 --> 29:27.393
I'll be there.

29:27.432 --> 29:28.922
Okay, kid.

29:28.967 --> 29:30.730
I'll see you at 6:00.

29:31.870 --> 29:32.894
You did good, boss.

29:32.937 --> 29:37.271
Yeah, well, the kid's a pain,

29:37.308 --> 29:39.902
but I suppose I'm going to have
to get used to it

29:39.944 --> 29:42.174
if I ever want to get to see
my grandchildren.

29:44.516 --> 29:47.451
Uh, could you excuse us, please?

29:47.485 --> 29:49.214
Sure.

29:54.225 --> 29:56.750
The kid's on his way here.
I told him 6:00.

29:56.795 --> 29:58.319
It's done.

29:58.363 --> 29:59.796
Good.

30:07.038 --> 30:09.302
I heard the new son-in-law's
on his way over.

30:09.340 --> 30:11.467
I think the old man
had a change of heart.

30:11.509 --> 30:13.841
- That's nice.
- He's not a bad kid, you know.

30:13.878 --> 30:16.438
Maybe the mister'll
offer him a job.

30:16.481 --> 30:18.381
Yeah, right.

30:18.416 --> 30:20.907
If he makes it alive,
maybe he'll give him a job.

30:40.471 --> 30:44.999
Hey, do you mind
I took the phone off the hook?

30:45.076 --> 30:46.976
So we don't get
any more interruptions.

30:47.011 --> 30:48.808
That's probably a good idea.

30:48.847 --> 30:50.405
- Yeah, come on, sit down.
- Uh-uh.

30:50.448 --> 30:52.143
Come on, your friends went
through all this trouble.

30:52.183 --> 30:53.650
Sit.

30:53.685 --> 30:59.646
I want you to know that whatever
you want is okay with me.

30:59.691 --> 31:01.352
I'm not going to
hold you to anything.

31:01.392 --> 31:03.690
Dylan, I can't wait
till we're on the plane,

31:03.728 --> 31:06.219
and we can... put
all of this behind us.

31:06.264 --> 31:07.891
Mm-hmm. Mm.

31:07.932 --> 31:09.263
Mm, me, too.

31:09.300 --> 31:10.631
- Now let's eat.
- Okay.

31:10.668 --> 31:12.295
Hey, did you see the cat today?

31:12.337 --> 31:13.861
Come to think of it, no.

31:13.905 --> 31:16.135
You know what, I didn't
see her last night either.

31:16.174 --> 31:17.937
I hope she's not
out in the rain.

31:17.976 --> 31:19.034
She'll be fine.

31:20.578 --> 31:22.842
Here, kitty, here,
kitty, kitty, kitty.

31:22.881 --> 31:24.542
- Trouble.
- Here, Trouble.

31:24.582 --> 31:25.708
Come on.

31:25.750 --> 31:28.275
- Come on.
- Come on, kitty.

31:28.319 --> 31:29.877
Here, kitty, kitty,
kitty, kitty.

31:29.921 --> 31:31.388
Here Kitty, kitty, kitty.

31:31.422 --> 31:33.083
Can you go find her?

31:33.124 --> 31:34.386
It's gonna be dark soon.

31:34.425 --> 31:38.657
Yeah, I'll go out
and check the front yard.

31:38.696 --> 31:40.254
I'll bring her back,
I promise.

31:40.298 --> 31:42.562
Good, 'cause you know, we
can't leave town without her.

31:42.600 --> 31:43.567
I love her.

31:43.601 --> 31:44.590
- Yeah.
- Right.

31:44.636 --> 31:46.001
Here, Trouble,
here Trouble, here.

31:47.405 --> 31:48.531
Here Trouble.
Come here.

32:11.396 --> 32:12.954
Peach Pit.

32:13.031 --> 32:14.498
Is Brandon Walsh there?

32:14.532 --> 32:16.397
Yeah, sure, he's here.
Who's calling?

32:16.434 --> 32:18.265
- It's Bruno.
- Oh, hi, Bruno.

32:18.303 --> 32:20.294
Yeah... hang on, right here,

32:20.338 --> 32:21.862
Bruno, what's shaking?

32:21.906 --> 32:23.396
Brandon, I can't reach Dylan.

32:23.441 --> 32:25.773
You've got to find him.
The old man's put a hit on him.

32:25.810 --> 32:27.869
Yeah. I'll get over there
as soon as I can.

32:27.912 --> 32:29.641
Brandon, where're you running?

32:50.902 --> 32:52.494
No luck.

32:52.537 --> 32:54.835
Dylan, we have to find her.
It's cold outside.

32:54.872 --> 32:56.499
It's raining, it's pouring,
she's gonna get sick,

32:56.541 --> 32:59.271
I know. Look, I'll stay
here and find the cat.

32:59.310 --> 33:00.470
So, why don't you go downtown
and see your father,

33:00.511 --> 33:01.569
'cause we got a plane to catch.

33:01.612 --> 33:02.943
All right, as long
as you find the cat.

33:02.981 --> 33:04.107
I will.

33:04.148 --> 33:07.140
But here, wear this.
Tell your father

33:07.185 --> 33:10.382
I said thank you for whatever
it is that he's giving you.

33:10.421 --> 33:11.888
You know something.
You're a hell of a guy.

33:11.923 --> 33:14.357
You know something else?
You are beautiful, but I'm wet.

33:15.360 --> 33:17.157
- I love you.
- I love you.

33:17.195 --> 33:18.560
All right, drive safe.

33:18.596 --> 33:20.461
All right, keys.

33:20.498 --> 33:22.227
- Keys.
- Gotta have 'em.

33:22.266 --> 33:23.597
- Bye.
- Bye.

33:44.288 --> 33:46.153
Damn cat.

33:46.190 --> 33:48.488
Dylan!

33:49.494 --> 33:51.223
- Good, you're here.
- What?

33:51.262 --> 33:52.559
Bruno called me; he told me

33:52.597 --> 33:53.894
not to let you go downtown
to Marchette's.

33:53.931 --> 33:54.989
Something's up.

33:55.066 --> 33:57.432
Toni already left
to go down there, man.

34:12.717 --> 34:14.275
What the hell?

34:40.545 --> 34:41.944
- What happened?
- I don't know.

34:41.978 --> 34:43.639
I-I was just coming
down the street.

34:43.681 --> 34:44.978
I think it was a carjacking.

34:45.016 --> 34:45.983
No!

34:46.050 --> 34:47.915
God! Brandon!

34:47.952 --> 34:49.817
Oh, baby!

34:49.853 --> 34:51.981
Oh, my God!

34:52.090 --> 34:53.489
Oh!

34:53.524 --> 34:56.288
Look what they did
to her, Brandon!

34:56.327 --> 34:58.158
Oh... Oh...

35:02.033 --> 35:04.593
Oh... oh, God!

35:31.062 --> 35:32.654
No matter what
that eyewitness says,

35:32.697 --> 35:35.928
you and I both know those
bullets were not meant for Toni.

35:35.967 --> 35:38.458
Not one word, Brandon.

35:38.503 --> 35:40.528
Not to anybody, you understand?

35:40.571 --> 35:42.300
Why won't you talk
to the police?

35:42.340 --> 35:44.331
Nothing I could say
will bring her back.

35:44.375 --> 35:46.172
You know,
I don't understand you, McKay.

35:46.210 --> 35:47.734
First your father,
now your wife.

35:47.778 --> 35:50.542
You actually going to let
this guy get away with this?

35:50.581 --> 35:52.913
Come on.

35:52.950 --> 35:55.441
Let's get this over with.

36:31.956 --> 36:34.117
How's Dylan holding up?

36:34.158 --> 36:35.955
He's putting up
a pretty good front,

36:35.993 --> 36:37.790
but I think he's about to crack.

36:37.828 --> 36:40.626
She was so beautiful...
how could anyone do this to her?

36:42.800 --> 36:46.964
The Lord is my shepherd;
I shall not want.

36:47.038 --> 36:50.667
He maketh me
lie down in green pastures;

36:50.708 --> 36:53.939
He leadeth me
beside the still waters.

36:53.978 --> 36:55.969
He restoreth my soul;

36:56.013 --> 36:59.073
He leadeth me
in the paths of righteousness

36:59.116 --> 37:01.084
for His name's sake.

37:01.118 --> 37:03.416
Yea, though I walk
through the valley

37:03.454 --> 37:07.151
of the shadow of death,
I will fear no evil;

37:07.191 --> 37:08.920
for Thou art with me;

37:08.993 --> 37:13.157
Thy rod and Thy staff,
they comfort me.

37:13.197 --> 37:15.188
Thou preparest a table before me

37:15.233 --> 37:18.828
in the presence of mine enemies;

37:18.869 --> 37:21.861
Thou anointest my head with oil;

37:21.906 --> 37:24.466
my cup runneth over.

37:24.508 --> 37:27.204
Surely goodness and mercy

37:27.245 --> 37:29.236
shall follow me
all the days of my life;

37:29.280 --> 37:30.941
and I will dwell

37:31.015 --> 37:34.678
in the house
of the Lord forever.

37:34.719 --> 37:36.209
Amen.

37:56.474 --> 37:58.271
Come on, man, let's go.

37:58.309 --> 37:59.970
No.

38:03.948 --> 38:05.415
You get rid of everybody.

38:05.449 --> 38:07.508
I got some unfinished business.

38:07.551 --> 38:09.212
Okay.

38:24.001 --> 38:27.767
If not for you,
I'd still have Antonia.

38:27.805 --> 38:29.932
She didn't have to die.

38:29.974 --> 38:32.568
You killed her.

38:43.988 --> 38:45.979
Go on.

38:52.029 --> 38:55.658
Go on.
Go on.

38:55.700 --> 38:57.361
Do it!

39:01.272 --> 39:05.470
Anything I ever had to live for
has been taken from me.

39:05.509 --> 39:07.067
Go on.

39:07.111 --> 39:09.341
You'll be doing me

39:09.380 --> 39:12.008
and yourself a big favor.

39:18.222 --> 39:19.689
No.

39:22.693 --> 39:26.220
My father is gone.

39:26.263 --> 39:29.323
Your daughter is gone.

39:29.367 --> 39:31.528
We're even now.

39:34.538 --> 39:37.632
Killing is done.

42:00.551 --> 42:04.453
Boy, I've seen a lot of bad
things go down in my life,

42:04.488 --> 42:06.718
but never anything like this.

42:06.757 --> 42:09.157
Wonder what Dylan's
gonna do now.

42:09.193 --> 42:10.490
I don't think

42:10.528 --> 42:12.120
he'll be hanging out here
much longer.

42:12.162 --> 42:13.595
Who can blame him?

42:13.631 --> 42:16.327
Well, one thing's for sure...

42:16.367 --> 42:18.096
life is fragile.

42:18.135 --> 42:21.104
And bad things do happen
to good people.

42:21.138 --> 42:22.730
Well, I'm gonna miss him.

42:22.773 --> 42:23.899
Yeah.

42:23.941 --> 42:26.569
We're all gonna miss him, Donna.

42:43.360 --> 42:44.987
Hey, man.

42:46.697 --> 42:48.597
You going somewhere?

42:48.632 --> 42:50.827
Somewhere.

42:50.868 --> 42:52.802
Coming back?

42:52.836 --> 42:55.361
Maybe someday...

42:55.406 --> 42:57.237
maybe not.

42:57.274 --> 42:59.435
I understand.

42:59.476 --> 43:02.036
I know you do.

43:07.017 --> 43:09.781
Lock up the place
for me, will you?

43:09.820 --> 43:12.653
Sure.

43:20.731 --> 43:23.359
I guess I'll see you around.

43:23.400 --> 43:25.834
I guess.
