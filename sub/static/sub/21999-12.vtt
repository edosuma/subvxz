WEBVTT

00:02.220 --> 00:04.220
I gave them my 20s.

00:06.298 --> 00:07.724
I'm gonna be 30 next month.

00:09.549 --> 00:11.728
What am I supposed to do now?
Where am I supposed to go?

00:11.730 --> 00:12.779
Is there anything more pathetic

00:12.781 --> 00:15.231
than an unemployed
30-year-old white male?

00:15.233 --> 00:16.899
Okay.

00:17.405 --> 00:18.568
They fired you.

00:19.461 --> 00:20.769
Slamming your head into the wall

00:20.771 --> 00:22.121
isn't going to change that, is it?

00:22.123 --> 00:23.406
I hate them.

00:23.408 --> 00:25.291
Your anger is overwhelming you, Lex.

00:25.293 --> 00:27.110
I want to kill them, Doctor.

00:27.469 --> 00:30.146
That's what I want to do.
I want them to dieie.

00:30.148 --> 00:32.778
You're in a feeling place, Lex,
not a thinking place.

00:33.148 --> 00:34.815
We need to put reason back in charge.

00:34.817 --> 00:35.782
I know you know that.

00:35.784 --> 00:37.453
- Screw reason.
- ‭No.

00:37.938 --> 00:42.125
In moments of crisis,
when life overwhelms us,

00:42.651 --> 00:45.328
all we have is reason.

00:50.784 --> 00:52.119
Stand up.

01:00.502 --> 01:01.477
You're okay.

01:02.045 --> 01:03.797
You're going to be okay.

01:04.590 --> 01:06.566
This is not the end of your life.

01:08.051 --> 01:09.652
Y-You're here.

01:09.654 --> 01:12.556
In this room with me.

01:13.557 --> 01:15.491
It's just the two of us.

01:16.018 --> 01:19.629
We're gonna talk this out
and come up with a plan.

01:20.147 --> 01:21.155
Okay?

01:35.746 --> 01:37.706
I'm sorry, sir.
The partners are in a meeting.

01:39.458 --> 01:41.067
You can't go in there!

02:02.307 --> 02:03.890
- Thanks.
- ‭Yeah.

02:05.343 --> 02:06.782
- Jason.
- ‭Hmm.

02:08.263 --> 02:10.513
Donovan. Good to see you.

02:11.532 --> 02:12.731
I was surprised to hear from you.

02:13.116 --> 02:14.149
How long has it been?

02:14.151 --> 02:15.450
Too long.

02:15.953 --> 02:19.621
Coming over here, I kept
remembering the two of us.

02:19.623 --> 02:22.407
17 years ago, newly licensed,

02:22.409 --> 02:24.743
sharing that basement office
on West End Avenue.

02:24.745 --> 02:26.878
The dungeon.

02:26.880 --> 02:29.964
One window and the faint smell of mildew.

02:29.966 --> 02:31.677
Now here we are.

02:39.101 --> 02:40.842
I need your help, Jace.

02:41.978 --> 02:43.845
You read about Harper Milton Capital?

02:43.847 --> 02:45.230
Two or three months ago.

02:45.232 --> 02:47.932
Disgruntled ex-employee walks in
and shoots both partners.

02:47.934 --> 02:50.068
He was a patient of mine.

02:50.571 --> 02:52.987
The partners' widows are suing me.

02:52.989 --> 02:54.272
On what grounds?

02:54.274 --> 02:56.024
Psychotherapy malpractice.

02:58.161 --> 03:01.079
So was he dangerous?
Hindsight not withstanding?

03:01.081 --> 03:03.164
He was troubled, depression.

03:03.166 --> 03:05.784
Intermittent Explosive Disorder.

03:05.786 --> 03:08.536
Some PTSD as a result
of childhood trauma.

03:08.922 --> 03:10.839
But I conducted the risk assessment,

03:10.841 --> 03:13.508
and he had no specific plans
to commit violence.

03:13.510 --> 03:15.877
Then legally I think you have a case.

03:15.879 --> 03:17.545
Dr. Donovan Benanti.

03:17.547 --> 03:19.381
Award-winning psychologist

03:19.383 --> 03:20.715
and, according to our fearless leader,

03:20.717 --> 03:23.351
one of the nicest guys
and most meticulous clinicians

03:23.353 --> 03:24.386
in the business.

03:24.388 --> 03:26.137
Which I'm sure will be abundantly clear

03:26.139 --> 03:28.556
from the six months of session
notes Benanti's turned over

03:28.558 --> 03:29.638
regarding Lex Becker.

03:29.640 --> 03:31.586
Well, sorry to be a
buzz kill here, but...

03:32.233 --> 03:34.695
Bull's friend saw the killer
on the same day he was fired

03:34.695 --> 03:37.029
and the same day he killed those men.

03:37.031 --> 03:40.449
Now, he had to have been
a mess in that session.

03:40.829 --> 03:43.585
Why didn't Dr. Benanti warn anyone?

03:43.587 --> 03:48.206
Because thoughts and actions
are two different things.

03:48.712 --> 03:50.759
That's why the professional
standard in a case like this

03:50.761 --> 03:52.844
is for the psychologist to determine

03:52.846 --> 03:55.380
if there is a serious
and imminent threat.

03:55.382 --> 03:58.550
OKAY, I'LL ASK: What is
"a serious and imminent threat"?

03:58.552 --> 04:01.520
As defined by law,
a serious and imminent threat

04:01.522 --> 04:04.723
an identified victim,

04:04.725 --> 04:07.726
a specific plan
to commit violence, and means.

04:07.728 --> 04:09.991
- Means, like a weapon.
- Yes.

04:09.993 --> 04:11.279
And without all three of those elements,

04:11.281 --> 04:12.898
the law does not require a clinician

04:12.900 --> 04:14.900
to break doctor-patient confidentiality.

04:14.902 --> 04:17.402
But then you've got two grieving
widows at the plaintiff's table.

04:17.404 --> 04:18.904
That is our challenge.

04:18.906 --> 04:22.074
Annabelle Harper and Sherryl
Milton lost their husbands.

04:22.076 --> 04:23.458
The jury will sympathize

04:23.460 --> 04:25.410
and want to compensate them
for their suffering.

04:25.412 --> 04:27.412
Okay, so how about we end this

04:27.414 --> 04:28.580
before it gets to a jury?

04:28.582 --> 04:29.915
I mean, why don't we try
to talk settlement?

04:29.917 --> 04:31.466
Dr. Benanti is in private practice.

04:31.468 --> 04:34.636
He gets his clients through
reputation and recommendations.

04:34.638 --> 04:37.756
If he appears to admit liability
in a double murder-suicide,

04:37.758 --> 04:39.141
his career is over.

04:39.143 --> 04:40.392
You're right.

04:41.098 --> 04:42.928
But I've got another idea.

04:43.558 --> 04:45.063
The defense would like to argue

04:45.065 --> 04:47.065
a motion for summary
judgment in this case.

04:47.067 --> 04:48.850
Your Honor, to throw this lawsuit out

04:48.852 --> 04:51.937
before going to trial would be
a gross miscarriage of justice.

04:52.609 --> 04:54.322
On what grounds, Mr. Colón?

04:54.324 --> 04:56.074
We understand why Mrs. Harper

04:56.076 --> 04:58.777
and Mrs. Milton filed suit.

04:58.779 --> 05:02.447
When the perpetrator of
a crime commits suicide,

05:02.911 --> 05:05.617
survivors want to hold
someone else accountable.

05:05.619 --> 05:07.002
But that doesn't change the fact

05:07.004 --> 05:09.564
that Dr. Benanti did nothing wrong.

05:09.566 --> 05:11.456
The case simply doesn't
stand up on its own merits.

05:11.458 --> 05:12.457
I beg to differ.

05:12.459 --> 05:14.042
At best, the plaintiffs

05:14.044 --> 05:17.796
can argue that, given
Lex's anger at being fired,

05:17.798 --> 05:19.347
he identified his bosses

05:19.349 --> 05:22.184
as potential victims to Dr. Benanti.

05:22.186 --> 05:24.102
That's one out of the three

05:24.104 --> 05:26.555
of the major elements needed to report.

05:26.557 --> 05:27.973
How about three out of three?

05:29.359 --> 05:31.276
This video is time-stamped two days

05:31.278 --> 05:34.112
before Lex Becker killed
Brady Harper and Tobias Milton...

05:34.114 --> 05:36.648
killed them by shooting them in the head,

05:36.650 --> 05:39.818
just like he's practicing there,
with the same type of gun

05:39.820 --> 05:41.453
that was used in the murders.

05:41.455 --> 05:43.622
It might be the same
gun, for all we know.

05:43.624 --> 05:45.240
I don't know about you, Your Honor,

05:45.242 --> 05:46.875
but this certainly looks like evidence

05:46.877 --> 05:48.460
of planning and means to me.

05:48.462 --> 05:50.462
Oh, that video could mean
anything, Your Honor.

05:50.464 --> 05:52.749
It certainly doesn't
prove that Dr. Benanti

05:52.751 --> 05:54.749
- had any knowledge of...
- I don't know

05:54.751 --> 05:57.052
what it proves, Mr. Colón.

05:57.054 --> 05:59.745
But we'll certainly have ample time

05:59.747 --> 06:02.424
to get to the bottom of that
in front of a jury.

06:02.449 --> 06:06.061
So, motion for summary judgment denied.

06:06.433 --> 06:10.348
I am ordering this case
to trial immediately.

06:10.771 --> 06:12.817
I've got Chunk going to the gun range

06:12.819 --> 06:15.684
to confirm whose gun Lex
was actually using there.

06:15.686 --> 06:16.662
Excellent.

06:16.664 --> 06:18.490
And since the gun used
in the murder-suicide

06:18.492 --> 06:21.185
was actually left behind
and taken into evidence,

06:21.187 --> 06:23.722
Danny was able to confirm
that it was unregistered.

06:23.724 --> 06:26.364
The serial numbers were scratched off.

06:26.366 --> 06:28.083
So there's no record of its purchase.

06:28.085 --> 06:29.367
Exactly.

06:29.369 --> 06:31.203
Well, that is a great start,

06:31.205 --> 06:34.774
but I need someone to tell me
what set this guy off.

06:35.378 --> 06:36.875
From the moment he left Don's office

06:36.877 --> 06:38.877
to the moment he killed
those men, what happened?

06:38.879 --> 06:42.013
Was there some incident
that triggered this?

06:42.015 --> 06:43.765
There's no better way
to prove that Don had

06:43.767 --> 06:46.051
nothing to do with this
than to tell a jury who did.

06:47.946 --> 06:49.304
- Ah.
- ‭Wow, Jace.

06:49.306 --> 06:51.940
- Don.
- This is quite something.

06:51.942 --> 06:53.892
Don Benanti.

06:53.894 --> 06:55.310
Finest clinical psychologist
I've ever met.

06:55.312 --> 06:56.561
I'd like you to meet

06:56.563 --> 06:58.967
Benny Colón, the finest in-house attorney

06:58.969 --> 07:01.673
I've ever worked with, and
your current counsel of record.

07:01.675 --> 07:02.893
Pleasure to meet you.

07:02.895 --> 07:04.286
Thrilled you're willing to take this on.

07:04.288 --> 07:07.372
Oh, I take on pretty much
whatever he takes on.

07:07.374 --> 07:09.040
He signs the checks.

07:09.042 --> 07:10.458
Aha.

07:10.460 --> 07:14.827
So, today we go and start,
uh, w-what is that word?

07:14.829 --> 07:17.598
Voir dire. Jury selection.

07:17.623 --> 07:18.989
But before we get to that,

07:18.991 --> 07:20.707
Benny, would you give us a moment?

07:20.709 --> 07:22.133
Sure.

07:27.806 --> 07:30.133
Tell me you didn't know
he was going to the gun range.

07:30.559 --> 07:32.085
Prosecution has security footage

07:32.087 --> 07:34.505
of your patient
shooting human silhouettes

07:34.507 --> 07:36.557
right between the eyes
for almost an hour,

07:36.559 --> 07:39.593
less than two days before
he executed those men.

07:42.112 --> 07:43.680
Tell me you didn't know about this.

07:44.656 --> 07:47.017
I can't. I knew.

07:47.576 --> 07:48.735
Truth is

07:48.737 --> 07:50.187
it was my idea.

07:50.189 --> 07:52.940
Come on, Donovan. A gun range?

07:52.942 --> 07:55.025
For a patient with
Intermittent Explosive Disorder?

07:55.027 --> 07:56.527
- Really?
- ‭Really.

07:56.529 --> 07:58.412
I felt he needed safe, controlled ways

07:58.414 --> 08:00.280
to release his aggression.

08:00.672 --> 08:03.333
I was trying to introduce him
to new coping mechanisms.

08:03.335 --> 08:04.501
Shooting,

08:04.503 --> 08:06.503
fencing, Thai boxing.

08:06.505 --> 08:08.839
A variety of activities
I hoped would allow him

08:08.841 --> 08:11.725
to work out his anger
in a socially appropriate way.

08:12.767 --> 08:13.794
Don't judge me.

08:14.163 --> 08:16.213
You know as well as I do,
just because someone

08:16.215 --> 08:17.464
goes to a gun range doesn't mean

08:17.466 --> 08:18.715
they're planning to shoot someone.

08:18.717 --> 08:20.467
A depressive with PTSD
and impulse control issues

08:20.469 --> 08:21.980
isn't just "someone."

08:21.982 --> 08:23.220
Well, I don't know what to tell you.

08:23.570 --> 08:24.946
It was working.

08:25.190 --> 08:28.058
He was markedly calmer,
showing great improvement.

08:28.700 --> 08:29.868
Huh.

08:30.563 --> 08:32.479
All right. Come on.

08:32.481 --> 08:34.831
Let's go. Court awaits.

08:38.037 --> 08:39.620
So let's talk narrative.

08:39.961 --> 08:41.063
Narrative?

08:41.065 --> 08:43.073
A trial is a battle
of two competing stories.

08:43.075 --> 08:45.909
They tell their stories and we tell ours.

08:45.911 --> 08:47.077
So what's our narrative?

08:47.079 --> 08:48.378
Simple.

08:48.380 --> 08:49.913
Psychologists aren't mind police.

08:49.915 --> 08:52.132
Holding them responsible for
the actions of their patients

08:52.134 --> 08:53.717
after they leave the doctor's office

08:53.719 --> 08:57.187
is not only impossible, it's dangerous.

09:01.226 --> 09:02.593
You know them?

09:02.595 --> 09:04.227
It's the widows of the men Lex killed.

09:04.229 --> 09:05.429
Otherwise known as

09:05.431 --> 09:06.980
the people taking you to court.

09:06.982 --> 09:09.099
And that's their lawyer, Mark Zimmer.

09:09.101 --> 09:10.651
It's okay to feel for them

09:10.653 --> 09:12.569
and still know they're in the wrong here.

09:12.571 --> 09:14.771
- Of course, I know that.
- In fact,

09:14.773 --> 09:17.441
that's what we'll be looking for
in our jurors.

09:17.443 --> 09:19.026
People that can make the distinction

09:19.028 --> 09:20.494
between logic and emotion.

09:20.496 --> 09:22.746
The other side will try
to play on the heartstrings.

09:22.748 --> 09:25.282
To counter that,
we need analytical thinkers.

09:25.284 --> 09:28.335
People who can separate what
happened in the hour you spent

09:28.337 --> 09:30.370
with Lex from everything
that happened afterward.

09:31.638 --> 09:32.923
Ms. Larsen,

09:32.925 --> 09:34.458
what do you do for a living?

09:35.461 --> 09:37.628
For a living? Data entry.

09:37.630 --> 09:39.262
Don't get too excited, Bull.

09:39.264 --> 09:41.598
Her seemingly perfect analytical job

09:41.600 --> 09:44.301
is only temp work;
she's trained as a dancer.

09:46.105 --> 09:47.804
The defense would like to thank

09:47.806 --> 09:48.805
and excuse this juror, Your Honor.

09:49.364 --> 09:50.891
When you go to a restaurant

09:50.893 --> 09:53.143
with a group of friends,

09:53.576 --> 09:56.697
who here takes control, splits the bill

09:56.699 --> 09:57.998
and calculates a tip?

09:59.124 --> 10:00.567
These three jurors are acceptable

10:00.569 --> 10:02.083
to the defense, Your Honor.

10:02.085 --> 10:03.987
Happy dividing and compartmentalizing.

10:03.989 --> 10:05.956
That's exactly what we want.

10:07.626 --> 10:08.709
Martin Hamilton.

10:09.171 --> 10:10.494
28 years old.

10:10.496 --> 10:11.745
Software engineer.

10:11.747 --> 10:14.831
His job requires both creative
and analytical skills.

10:14.833 --> 10:16.599
That's a tough call.

10:17.350 --> 10:18.802
How many hot dog vendors

10:18.804 --> 10:21.054
would you say are
in the borough of Manhattan?

10:21.820 --> 10:23.674
Uh, well,

10:23.676 --> 10:27.227
if Manhattan is about
250 blocks north to south

10:27.229 --> 10:30.063
and 12 avenues east to west...

10:30.065 --> 10:31.848
A regimented thinker.

10:31.850 --> 10:33.600
Perfect.

10:33.602 --> 10:35.519
...one cart for every nine square blocks,

10:35.521 --> 10:36.937
- I would say...
- ‭Thank you.

10:36.939 --> 10:39.356
Juror number two is acceptable
to the defense, Your Honor.

10:39.358 --> 10:41.191
Then we have our jury.

10:45.497 --> 10:49.533
Okay. Well, we got
what we needed, didn't we?

10:49.924 --> 10:51.368
We did.

10:51.760 --> 10:54.204
We got what we needed based
on what we know today,

10:54.206 --> 10:58.091
but you're a smart guy, Don,
so I need to prepare you.

10:58.093 --> 11:00.343
A trial is a lot like
an approaching storm.

11:00.345 --> 11:01.428
You know it's coming.

11:01.430 --> 11:02.879
You pull together appropriate provisions,

11:02.881 --> 11:05.382
you board up the house, but
you still have to ride it out

11:05.384 --> 11:07.517
and hope it isn't
any stronger than you thought,

11:07.519 --> 11:09.936
or lasts any longer than you expected.

11:09.938 --> 11:12.238
Anything can happen.

11:13.323 --> 11:14.307
What?

11:14.309 --> 11:15.784
Please.

11:16.111 --> 11:17.811
I have weather insurance.

11:17.813 --> 11:19.646
I have Jason Bull.

11:24.319 --> 11:32.348

Entrez.

11:39.181 --> 11:40.961
Entra.

11:41.351 --> 11:42.329
Eniru.

11:42.331 --> 11:43.597
Hmm.

11:43.599 --> 11:46.333
See, that's French, Italian,
and I have no idea.

11:46.335 --> 11:48.352
Esperanto, just in case.

11:48.808 --> 11:49.737
Nice.

11:49.739 --> 11:52.711
When the Tower of Babel falls,
I am sticking with you.

11:53.065 --> 11:54.275
So you need to check this out.

11:54.864 --> 11:57.111
It's Benanti's notes
from a session with Lex.

11:57.113 --> 11:58.880
His first session, actually.

11:59.494 --> 12:00.531
And?

12:00.533 --> 12:03.584
And look at the upper right-hand corner.

12:04.040 --> 12:05.753
"Referred by A. Harper."

12:06.722 --> 12:07.813
A. Harper.

12:07.815 --> 12:09.958
You don't think Annabelle Harper,

12:09.960 --> 12:12.544
Brady Harper's widow,
the plaintiff in this case,

12:12.546 --> 12:14.379
referred Lex to Benanti, do you?

12:17.334 --> 12:19.000
Hmm.

12:19.002 --> 12:20.885
- Door-to-door service.
- ‭Ah.

12:20.887 --> 12:22.670
You guys really are a one-stop shop.

12:22.672 --> 12:24.305
I have something to run by you.

12:24.307 --> 12:26.224
I wanted to do it in private

12:26.226 --> 12:28.176
before we go to court.

12:28.178 --> 12:29.844
Sounds serious.

12:29.846 --> 12:32.097
Hmm. Kind of a hypothetical.

12:32.099 --> 12:33.903
Okay.

12:34.651 --> 12:37.569
If, in some kind of alternate universe,

12:37.571 --> 12:39.437
a former patient of yours were

12:39.439 --> 12:41.523
to take the stand in a lawsuit...

12:41.525 --> 12:43.491
mind you, I'm not asking you

12:44.038 --> 12:46.568
to reveal any privileged information...

12:46.570 --> 12:49.831
but if, hypothetically,
that were to happen,

12:50.170 --> 12:52.867
would your legal team
have anything to worry about?

12:55.839 --> 12:58.373
I'd like to think
I've been a great counselor

12:58.375 --> 13:00.592
to all of my patients.

13:03.547 --> 13:04.934
Hmm.

13:05.599 --> 13:07.348
I was still half asleep

13:07.350 --> 13:10.607
when Brady kissed me good-bye
that morning.

13:11.316 --> 13:12.660
If I'd known it was the last time

13:12.662 --> 13:14.444
I'd ever see him, I...

13:15.358 --> 13:17.725
Just wish I'd put my
glasses on, you know?

13:18.656 --> 13:21.242
So I could have really looked at him.

13:22.744 --> 13:24.566
The crow's-feet around his eyes

13:24.568 --> 13:26.734
when he smiled, and...

13:26.736 --> 13:29.204
the way he chewed on his lower lip

13:29.792 --> 13:32.574
when he pretended to be listening but

13:32.576 --> 13:34.672
his mind was somewhere else.

13:36.329 --> 13:37.884
If I'd have known, I'd...

13:39.052 --> 13:40.845
I'd have gotten up,

13:41.971 --> 13:43.848
put my arms around him.

13:44.557 --> 13:46.421
Never let him walk out that door.

13:46.893 --> 13:48.506
Objection, Your Honor.

13:48.508 --> 13:50.725
With all due respect, relevance.

13:50.727 --> 13:52.427
Sustained.

13:52.429 --> 13:53.895
I'll tell you the relevance.

13:53.897 --> 13:56.460
Analytical or not,
the jurors are eating this up.

13:56.462 --> 13:58.399
They really feel for this woman, Bull.

13:58.401 --> 14:00.602
Of course they do.
She's a sympathy machine.

14:00.604 --> 14:01.769
Benny'll get her back on cross.

14:01.771 --> 14:03.238
I hope so,

14:03.240 --> 14:05.773
because I'm beginning to forget
what the color green looks like.

14:05.775 --> 14:07.333
No further questions, Your Honor.

14:07.335 --> 14:09.457
Your witness, Counselor.

14:12.043 --> 14:13.615
I'd like to begin by saying

14:13.617 --> 14:17.535
how profoundly sorry I am for your loss.

14:18.527 --> 14:19.954
Thank you. I appreciate that.

14:19.956 --> 14:21.261
You're welcome.

14:21.625 --> 14:24.509
Um, but I have to ask.

14:24.511 --> 14:27.962
In Dr. Benanti's session notes,

14:27.964 --> 14:32.133
he mentions that Lex was
referred to him by an A. Harper.

14:32.814 --> 14:34.102
Was that you?

14:35.316 --> 14:37.805
Brady had mentioned there was a bright

14:37.807 --> 14:40.391
but troubled young trader at the firm.

14:40.393 --> 14:42.727
There'd been a few outbursts,

14:43.116 --> 14:45.063
and he said he thought he might

14:45.065 --> 14:49.284
have to let this kid, Lex, go.

14:49.286 --> 14:54.289
And, um, I recommended he send
him to Dr. Benanti instead

14:54.924 --> 14:56.624
and try to get him help.

14:58.461 --> 15:00.628
I wish to God now that I hadn't.

15:01.301 --> 15:04.415
And how did you know Dr. Benanti?

15:04.804 --> 15:06.915
Did you, uh, read about him?

15:06.917 --> 15:09.721
Did you hear about him from a friend?

15:09.723 --> 15:10.890
Why did you recommend...?

15:10.892 --> 15:13.083
Objection, Your Honor. Privileged.

15:13.085 --> 15:14.926
It's all right. Mark, I'll answer.

15:14.928 --> 15:16.227
I have nothing to hide.

15:17.233 --> 15:18.846
I recommended Dr. Benanti

15:18.848 --> 15:20.848
because he was my therapist.

15:20.850 --> 15:23.184
I had been going through a hard time,

15:23.186 --> 15:25.403
and I sought treatment from him.

15:25.405 --> 15:27.452
That's interesting.

15:27.454 --> 15:31.179
So, in the time that you
went to Dr. Benanti,

15:31.181 --> 15:35.697
did you find him to be
a negligent practitioner,

15:35.699 --> 15:39.083
as your lawsuit suggests he was with Lex?

15:41.254 --> 15:42.800
No.

15:43.676 --> 15:46.708
No. In fact, he was
actually very thorough,

15:46.929 --> 15:48.376
very attentive.

15:49.140 --> 15:51.517
He-he helped me a great deal.

15:52.048 --> 15:55.216
He'd even call between sessions
to check up on me.

15:55.218 --> 15:56.814
Wow.

15:57.103 --> 16:00.438
Sounds like Dr. Benanti was
the opposite of negligent.

16:00.440 --> 16:03.780
Sounds like he was downright solicitous.

16:04.947 --> 16:07.145
No further questions, Your Honor.

16:07.147 --> 16:08.730
Hey, you were right, Bull.

16:08.732 --> 16:09.981
Benny is killing it.

16:09.983 --> 16:11.983
I think we're out of the woods
with Annabelle.

16:11.985 --> 16:14.619
Oh, I'm not so sure about that.

16:24.414 --> 16:26.581
Tell me you did not sleep with a patient.

16:26.583 --> 16:28.742
Tell me you did not sleep
with Annabelle Harper.

16:28.744 --> 16:29.833
What are you talking about?

16:29.835 --> 16:31.124
Of course I didn't sleep with my patient.

16:31.126 --> 16:34.255
When she was on the stand,
you were leaning in, preening,

16:34.257 --> 16:35.640
mirroring her facial expressions.

16:35.642 --> 16:37.091
It was like a freshman lecture

16:37.093 --> 16:39.093
on subconscious indicators
of intimacy and attraction.

16:39.095 --> 16:41.262
Bull, I promise you,
I didn't sleep with her.

16:41.264 --> 16:43.348
Okay, did you ever touch her? Kiss her?

16:43.350 --> 16:45.266
Were you in love with her?
Was it an emotional affair?

16:45.268 --> 16:47.235
I mean, were there
any e-mails, texts, gifts?

16:47.237 --> 16:48.770
How exposed are we on this?!

16:48.772 --> 16:49.996
Jason, slow down.

16:49.998 --> 16:52.495
Okay. I...

16:52.942 --> 16:55.109
admired Annabelle.

16:55.706 --> 16:56.995
Her thoughtfulness.

16:56.997 --> 16:59.497
How gracefully she dealt with
what she was going through.

16:59.499 --> 17:02.283
But did I have feelings for her? Perhaps.

17:02.713 --> 17:04.502
I've had feelings for a thousand people,

17:04.503 --> 17:06.753
some of them my patients.

17:07.300 --> 17:08.589
You know how it is.

17:08.590 --> 17:10.124
Our line of work.

17:10.126 --> 17:11.459
But I swear to you,

17:11.461 --> 17:14.183
I broke no ethical boundaries.

17:15.435 --> 17:17.348
Did she know about your feelings for her?

17:17.895 --> 17:20.852
I certainly hope not.
No, she couldn't have.

17:20.854 --> 17:22.804
Well, she mentioned phone calls.

17:22.806 --> 17:25.138
I mean, I worked
clinical practice eight years,

17:25.141 --> 17:28.393
and I made follow-up calls
maybe six times.

17:28.990 --> 17:30.478
Why did you call her? What would you say?

17:30.480 --> 17:31.779
You know that's confidential.

17:31.781 --> 17:33.448
- Well...
- ‭But I swear to you,

17:33.450 --> 17:35.233
I did not make those calls often,

17:35.235 --> 17:38.736
but when I did,
it was for an urgent reason.

17:38.738 --> 17:42.073
Please. Jason, you got to trust me here.

17:42.075 --> 17:44.659
You're my lifeline. You're all I've got.

17:46.496 --> 17:48.796
Of course I trust you.

17:49.385 --> 17:50.882
And I'm sorry. I just, I just...

17:50.884 --> 17:52.800
No, you don't have to be sorry.

17:53.681 --> 17:56.671
You're right. I understand.

17:56.673 --> 17:58.256
It's like a giant storm.

17:58.811 --> 18:01.225
And you're trying to read the weather.

18:18.669 --> 18:20.536
Anybody home?

18:25.243 --> 18:26.999
Hey, just, uh, wanted to let you know.

18:27.001 --> 18:28.382
We, uh, just wrapped up.

18:29.053 --> 18:30.395
Wrapped up what?

18:30.415 --> 18:31.832
Mock trial.

18:31.834 --> 18:34.468
Benny preparing Benanti
for his testimony.

18:34.889 --> 18:36.386
I stood up in the booth and watched.

18:36.388 --> 18:38.518
Man, what a show.

18:39.174 --> 18:40.924
You make it home last night?

18:40.926 --> 18:42.592
You get any sleep?

18:42.594 --> 18:44.273
Not that I'm aware of.

18:45.650 --> 18:47.627
Now, why are you poring over
Lex's patient records?

18:47.629 --> 18:49.565
Didn't Marissa prepare summaries
of those for you?

18:49.567 --> 18:50.901
What'd you come in here to tell me?

18:51.405 --> 18:54.303
Well, just that Benny grilled
Benanti six ways from Sunday,

18:54.305 --> 18:56.072
and he's rock solid.

18:56.074 --> 18:57.824
The guy's a quick learner.

18:57.826 --> 19:00.694
He was able to take everything
that Benny threw at him

19:00.696 --> 19:03.914
and use it to pivot back to the
talking points of our narrative.

19:03.916 --> 19:06.950
And the mock jury found him
extremely trustworthy.

19:06.952 --> 19:08.285
Of course they did.

19:08.287 --> 19:10.036
He's a student of human behavior.

19:10.038 --> 19:12.635
He knows how to read it,
he knows how to model it.

19:13.208 --> 19:14.595
Strike that.

19:15.294 --> 19:17.723
He's a master of human behavior.

19:18.599 --> 19:20.142
Best I've ever seen.

19:21.185 --> 19:22.382
What's wrong, Bull?

19:23.729 --> 19:25.635
I have no idea.

19:26.357 --> 19:28.305
And it's driving me crazy.

19:32.528 --> 19:34.699
The gun... where did Lex get it?

19:36.242 --> 19:38.773
Uh, well, we haven't really had much luck

19:38.775 --> 19:40.241
running that down, Bull.

19:40.243 --> 19:41.293
Why is that?

19:41.295 --> 19:43.320
It's a gun.
It had to come from somewhere.

19:43.322 --> 19:44.788
This one's on me.

19:44.790 --> 19:46.373
I figured with no serial number,

19:46.375 --> 19:48.491
it had to have been purchased illegally.

19:48.493 --> 19:50.794
And given Lex's white collar background,

19:50.796 --> 19:52.412
I assumed he got it online.

19:52.414 --> 19:55.048
But I've searched all
of the arms trading sites,

19:55.050 --> 19:57.500
and there's no record
of a Beretta being purchased

19:57.502 --> 19:59.669
from any of the I.P. addresses
Lex has access to.

19:59.671 --> 20:01.638
Wait a second. What kind of gun was it?

20:01.640 --> 20:04.474
A Beretta. A Beretta Tomcat.

20:05.104 --> 20:06.676
No, it wasn't.

20:17.617 --> 20:19.022
Jace.

20:19.660 --> 20:21.191
Come in.

20:22.361 --> 20:24.527
Want to have a seat?

20:25.530 --> 20:28.198
Or would you rather put your feet up?

20:28.200 --> 20:30.917
I'm not a patient.

20:31.297 --> 20:32.586
This isn't a session.

20:33.007 --> 20:35.205
Okay. What is it?

20:35.207 --> 20:37.257
I want to tell you a story.

20:37.259 --> 20:39.960
A story about a young,
ambitious psychologist

20:39.962 --> 20:42.712
just starting out in private practice.

20:43.267 --> 20:46.349
He wanted to make a difference,
so naturally he chose

20:46.351 --> 20:49.719
tough, sometimes even dangerous patients.

20:50.358 --> 20:52.973
And to protect himself, he kept
a Beretta Tomcat in his desk.

20:52.975 --> 20:54.608
Ring any bells?

20:56.697 --> 20:59.112
It was you and me against
the world in that office, Don,

20:59.114 --> 21:03.617
so I showed you my gun,
where I kept it, how to use it.

21:05.237 --> 21:07.833
Didn't you tell me you got
one of your own after I left?

21:07.835 --> 21:10.753
Didn't you tell me
it was just like the one I had?

21:12.463 --> 21:14.244
I need to see it.

21:29.063 --> 21:30.560
Aren't you gonna open it?

21:31.148 --> 21:32.566
What's the point?

21:33.275 --> 21:35.231
We both know it's empty.

21:37.235 --> 21:38.935
Do you believe in destiny?

21:42.240 --> 21:43.828
Every night,

21:45.079 --> 21:46.997
when I put my head on the pillow,

21:47.612 --> 21:49.625
I'd dream of her.

21:50.501 --> 21:52.115
I'd dream of us.

21:52.503 --> 21:57.003
And I also knew, of course,
that she was dreaming about me.

21:57.508 --> 21:59.422
But I also knew,

21:59.424 --> 22:01.262
deep down, that she was...

22:02.304 --> 22:04.014
un-have-able.

22:05.015 --> 22:07.380
She was married to Brady Harper...

22:07.727 --> 22:09.353
richer than God.

22:09.801 --> 22:11.351
And he wasn't going anywhere,

22:11.353 --> 22:13.103
and she wasn't about to leave him,

22:13.105 --> 22:15.109
so I made my peace with it.

22:15.524 --> 22:18.525
She was still mine on our afternoons.

22:18.527 --> 22:20.443
We still had our phone calls.

22:20.906 --> 22:22.645
She was my secret and I was her secret.

22:22.647 --> 22:23.980
And then one day,

22:23.982 --> 22:26.983
Lex walked in here and said
that her husband had fired him,

22:26.985 --> 22:29.319
that he wanted to kill him,
wanted him dead.

22:30.166 --> 22:31.988
I mean...

22:31.990 --> 22:34.491
isn't that the definition of destiny?

22:35.129 --> 22:36.993
All I really had to do was

22:36.995 --> 22:38.878
put the gun in his hand
and ask him nicely.

22:38.880 --> 22:42.582
He trusted you to help him, to save him.

22:42.584 --> 22:44.300
- And you used him...
- Used him,

22:44.302 --> 22:45.835
preyed on his shame, called him son,

22:45.837 --> 22:47.183
told him to make me proud.

22:47.556 --> 22:49.894
I gave him what he craved:

22:50.759 --> 22:54.010
a few moments of tenderness,
of understanding.

22:54.690 --> 22:57.981
And in the end,
I put him out of his misery.

22:57.983 --> 23:00.016
What's so wrong with that?

23:00.018 --> 23:03.019
So what if I got something
I wanted out of it, too?

23:03.741 --> 23:05.522
My God, you're certifiable.

23:05.524 --> 23:07.240
I'm nothing of the kind, Jason,

23:07.242 --> 23:08.658
and you know it.

23:08.660 --> 23:10.827
That's what's making you so angry.

23:10.829 --> 23:14.247
The pragmatism of it all,
the elegant simplicity of it.

23:14.249 --> 23:18.084
Our job is to improve lives,
Donovan, not destroy them.

23:18.086 --> 23:19.419
Says who?

23:19.421 --> 23:21.254
That's a fairy tale, Jace.

23:21.256 --> 23:24.874
Look around.
We swore no Hippocratic oath.

23:25.346 --> 23:26.709
We psychologists created

23:26.711 --> 23:29.179
the CIA's enhanced torture
program, for heaven's sake.

23:29.181 --> 23:32.599
No, sir. It's our job
to listen to people,

23:32.601 --> 23:35.935
to know them, and to decode
how it is they work.

23:35.937 --> 23:38.138
And what we do with
that information, well...

23:38.140 --> 23:41.775
You know I can't let this stand.
I can't be a party to this.

23:41.777 --> 23:43.276
I'm sorry, old friend.

23:43.278 --> 23:45.908
It's not like you have a lot of choice.

23:46.398 --> 23:48.828
You're a member of my defense team.

23:49.495 --> 23:51.985
This entire conversation is protected

23:51.987 --> 23:53.903
under attorney-client privilege.

23:53.905 --> 23:55.622
You can't call the police.

23:55.624 --> 23:57.540
You can't tell the authorities.

23:57.542 --> 23:59.459
You can't tell anyone.

24:22.406 --> 24:23.821
Early birds.

24:24.559 --> 24:26.991
Always been a couple of early birds.

24:39.207 --> 24:41.475
I couldn't sleep. How about you?

24:41.477 --> 24:43.076
You're the clinical psychologist, Don.

24:43.078 --> 24:44.341
You tell me.

24:44.746 --> 24:46.218
I can't lie.

24:46.632 --> 24:48.846
I was having nightmares that you quit.

24:49.751 --> 24:51.835
Doesn't work that way.

24:51.837 --> 24:54.921
I can't quit just because
a client is guilty.

24:55.269 --> 24:56.389
You tell anyone?

24:56.391 --> 24:57.674
Like who?

24:57.676 --> 25:00.858
Attorney-client privilege, remember?

25:01.263 --> 25:02.818
How about Benny?

25:03.432 --> 25:05.432
I'd never say a word to him.

25:05.821 --> 25:06.983
He's legally and ethically bound

25:06.985 --> 25:08.435
to provide a rigorous defense.

25:08.437 --> 25:11.488
I don't want to make that
any harder than it has to be.

25:11.490 --> 25:12.953
Thank you.

25:20.210 --> 25:21.748
Don't judge her.

25:21.750 --> 25:23.416
You can't judge her.

25:24.924 --> 25:25.952
What?

25:26.467 --> 25:28.928
You're a deeply disturbed man.

25:29.708 --> 25:32.264
I'm just happy you found your other.

25:34.601 --> 25:37.297
So, after you calmed Lex down,

25:37.299 --> 25:39.599
you did what's called a risk assessment.

25:39.601 --> 25:41.634
Now, what does that entail, exactly?

25:41.636 --> 25:43.737
It's a series of questions

25:43.739 --> 25:47.891
to try to ascertain
if Lex had any desires or plans

25:47.893 --> 25:50.143
to hurt himself or anyone else.

25:50.145 --> 25:52.946
And did he? In your opinion.

25:52.948 --> 25:55.148
No. I spent about

25:55.150 --> 25:57.817
25 minutes asking him
about his intentions.

25:57.819 --> 26:00.820
Not only did he not have
any plans to commit violence,

26:00.822 --> 26:02.739
his anger at being fired dissipated

26:02.741 --> 26:04.044
throughout our time together.

26:04.046 --> 26:06.126
Therefore, you determined that there was

26:06.128 --> 26:07.462
no need to warn anyone.

26:07.464 --> 26:09.546
In my career, I've been concerned

26:09.548 --> 26:11.998
about patients' intentions
enough to warn the authorities

26:12.000 --> 26:13.750
on more than one occasion,

26:13.752 --> 26:15.802
but this was not one of those times.

26:15.804 --> 26:18.555
Despite what happened
later that day, I can say

26:18.557 --> 26:21.557
without hesitation,
when Lex left my office,

26:21.559 --> 26:24.177
he gave every indication
that he had made his peace

26:24.179 --> 26:26.012
with being let go and was excited

26:26.014 --> 26:28.565
about exploring
new employment possibilities.

26:29.488 --> 26:31.783
No further questions, Your Honor.

26:31.785 --> 26:33.325
Your witness.

26:33.688 --> 26:35.989
Nothing but good news here.

26:35.991 --> 26:39.359
Our jurors seem very sympathetic
towards Dr. Benanti, Bull.

26:39.361 --> 26:41.961
They find him straightforward, honest.

26:42.501 --> 26:44.837
If he keeps this up,
I think we're home free.

26:45.333 --> 26:47.450
Bull? Can you hear me?

26:47.452 --> 26:49.002
Is this working?

26:49.004 --> 26:50.793
I heard you, Marissa. Thanks.

26:50.795 --> 26:53.083
This thorough risk assessment of yours...

26:53.085 --> 26:55.647
did you ask follow-up questions,
clarifying questions?

26:55.649 --> 26:58.044
The risk assessment
took as long as it did

26:58.046 --> 27:00.139
because I asked
so many clarifying questions.

27:00.140 --> 27:02.023
Did you specifically ask
if Lex had a gun?

27:02.025 --> 27:03.107
Yes. He said he did not.

27:03.109 --> 27:04.838
How do you know he wasn't lying to you?

27:04.840 --> 27:06.311
Well, I'm not a mind reader,

27:06.313 --> 27:08.243
but I saw no indication that he was.

27:08.245 --> 27:10.031
Hmm. Are you sure?

27:10.033 --> 27:12.951
Objection. Your Honor,
asked and answered.

27:12.953 --> 27:14.319
I'll rephrase.

27:14.321 --> 27:16.154
You were seeing ten patients a day.

27:16.156 --> 27:18.156
Is it possible you were
overworked or overtired,

27:18.158 --> 27:19.374
that you missed something?

27:19.376 --> 27:20.542
Anything is possible,

27:20.544 --> 27:23.211
I suppose, but I certainly wasn't aware

27:23.213 --> 27:25.580
of being overtired or overworked.

27:25.582 --> 27:29.834
Honestly, my focus at that point
was on my patient.

27:29.836 --> 27:31.502
Not engaging in speculation,

27:31.504 --> 27:33.888
keeping his cool, staying on message.

27:33.890 --> 27:35.673
Benny did an incredible job

27:35.675 --> 27:36.841
here, Bull.

27:36.843 --> 27:38.092
This guy's unflappable.

27:38.094 --> 27:39.594
Benanti might have 12 new clients

27:39.596 --> 27:41.012
by the time this is over.

27:42.349 --> 27:45.016
Can you really sit there, Dr. Benanti,

27:45.018 --> 27:47.649
now that two good men are dead...

27:48.271 --> 27:50.989
their widows without husbands,

27:50.991 --> 27:52.824
their children without fathers...

27:52.826 --> 27:54.359
can you really sit there

27:54.361 --> 27:56.661
and say you made the right decision?

27:57.117 --> 27:59.280
There are thousands
of young men in America

27:59.282 --> 28:02.367
with the same psychological
profile as Lex Becker.

28:03.165 --> 28:05.036
Most of them will never commit a crime.

28:05.626 --> 28:08.206
A frustrating truth is
that for all our progress

28:08.208 --> 28:10.790
in psychology and psychiatry,

28:10.792 --> 28:13.511
the human mind remains
very much a mystery.

28:13.926 --> 28:15.380
There's no surefire way to predict

28:15.382 --> 28:17.265
who can be reached and who can't,

28:17.888 --> 28:20.969
who will commit violence or who won't.

28:21.350 --> 28:24.355
All anyone can do is
make the best decision they can

28:24.357 --> 28:26.224
with the information they have.

28:26.226 --> 28:27.558
The power of logic.

28:27.560 --> 28:30.144
You put together the perfect
jury for this argument.

28:30.146 --> 28:32.814
Bu, it is a sea of green over here.

28:34.509 --> 28:36.657
We the jury find the defendant,

28:36.659 --> 28:40.655
Dr. Donovan Benanti, not liable.

28:41.328 --> 28:43.502
Court would like to
thank you for your service.

28:43.504 --> 28:44.482
You are dismissed.

28:44.484 --> 28:46.083
Congratulations, Doc.

29:04.685 --> 29:05.871
Who is it?

29:05.873 --> 29:08.016
Dr. Jason Bull. I'd love a word.

29:10.149 --> 29:11.319
I'm sorry.

29:11.321 --> 29:14.105
The doorman didn't call and
say you were on your way up.

29:14.107 --> 29:16.607
And, uh, I'm not in the
habit of opening my door

29:16.609 --> 29:18.276
for people who are unannounced.

29:18.278 --> 29:20.278
Mm. Well, if I go back down

29:20.280 --> 29:22.944
and have the doorman
announce me, will you let me in?

29:23.620 --> 29:25.750
Step away from my door, Dr. Bull,

29:25.752 --> 29:27.335
or I'm calling the police.

29:27.337 --> 29:29.751
Okay. I just...

29:31.170 --> 29:32.790
I'm sure you'll think this is crazy.

29:32.792 --> 29:35.176
I'm sure you'll think
this is beside the point,

29:35.178 --> 29:36.961
but I just need to know.

29:37.301 --> 29:38.963
If you wanted to be together so badly,

29:38.965 --> 29:40.932
and then went ahead and risked everything

29:40.934 --> 29:42.934
to make it happen and you love him,

29:42.936 --> 29:45.053
why did you take him to court?

29:50.355 --> 29:51.776
What are you talking about?

29:53.233 --> 29:55.480
Who are you talking about?

29:55.944 --> 29:57.738
Dr. Benanti?

29:58.201 --> 30:00.485
Be together? Love him?

30:02.140 --> 30:03.988
The man I love is dead.

30:03.990 --> 30:05.656
You just successfully defended

30:05.658 --> 30:07.992
the person responsible in court.

30:08.790 --> 30:10.918
Now get away from my door.

30:13.750 --> 30:15.380
Mrs. Harper.

30:16.590 --> 30:17.969
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

30:17.971 --> 30:19.676
I thought that...

30:20.507 --> 30:23.138
Doesn't matter what I thought.
I was wrong.

30:23.676 --> 30:25.724
I've been wrong about everything.

30:26.808 --> 30:28.679
But I want to fix it.

30:28.681 --> 30:31.015
Let me make this right, please.

30:31.355 --> 30:32.817
He fooled me, too.

30:33.565 --> 30:36.935
But I know some things, things
I can't legally share with you,

30:36.937 --> 30:39.690
but if you will trust me,

30:40.280 --> 30:41.405
if you'll give me a chance,

30:41.407 --> 30:43.277
I think that there is a way
we can make sure

30:43.279 --> 30:45.369
that he's punished for what he did...

30:46.745 --> 30:48.789
and a way to get you the truth.

30:54.962 --> 30:56.457
Please.

31:11.931 --> 31:13.848
Happy Saturday.

31:14.314 --> 31:15.767
Does anybody know why we're here?

31:15.769 --> 31:18.102
That seems to be
the million-dollar question.

31:18.104 --> 31:19.270
Where's Benny?

31:19.861 --> 31:21.072
I told him to stay home.

31:22.859 --> 31:24.442
Well, any particular reason?

31:24.866 --> 31:28.029
Because he is a member of the
New York State Bar Association.

31:28.031 --> 31:29.781
And that matters because...?

31:29.783 --> 31:32.116
Because we're gonna engage in
a little team-building activity.

31:32.118 --> 31:34.118
And if all goes well, the outside world

31:34.120 --> 31:36.504
will be none the wiser;
but if it doesn't,

31:37.170 --> 31:39.457
I don't want Benny to be
censured by the bar.

31:40.877 --> 31:42.627
I did what you asked.

31:42.629 --> 31:45.546
I called Dr. Benanti, asked
if he'd meet me for dinner.

31:45.548 --> 31:48.883
Said I wanted to try and make it
up to him for the lawsuit.

31:48.885 --> 31:51.269
You were right.
He, uh, he jumped at the chance.

31:51.271 --> 31:52.637
Excellent.

31:52.639 --> 31:55.473
I've got my whole team here.
They're all on board.

31:55.475 --> 31:58.142
Are you?

31:58.900 --> 32:01.320
I miss my husband, Dr. Bull.

32:01.981 --> 32:04.114
What's the worst that happens?

32:04.617 --> 32:05.867
I join him?

32:07.034 --> 32:08.452
That's your plan?

32:08.910 --> 32:10.204
We are gonna send this poor woman

32:10.206 --> 32:11.789
on a dinner date with a killer?

32:11.791 --> 32:13.374
Let's keep our facts straight.

32:13.999 --> 32:15.576
Don's never actually killed anyone,

32:15.578 --> 32:17.962
at least not by his own hand.

32:17.964 --> 32:20.581
That's what makes what he did so evil.

32:20.583 --> 32:22.049
I need him to confess,

32:22.051 --> 32:24.335
or he is gonna be free to take advantage

32:24.337 --> 32:26.337
of some poor damaged soul
and do it again.

32:26.339 --> 32:27.672
I am not asking about

32:27.674 --> 32:31.642
what you need, I'm asking
is this woman gonna be safe.

32:31.644 --> 32:32.927
Psychologically speaking,

32:32.929 --> 32:35.847
I have every reason
to believe she will be.

32:35.849 --> 32:39.233
Don harbors deep romantic
delusions about Annabelle.

32:39.235 --> 32:42.267
He believes they are
meant to be together.

32:42.269 --> 32:44.482
And now that her husband
is dead, they will be.

32:44.484 --> 32:46.574
As long as Annabelle plays
into those delusions,

32:46.576 --> 32:47.825
she should be fine.

32:47.827 --> 32:50.161
"Should be" doesn't inspire confidence.

32:50.163 --> 32:53.197
Well, the former cornerback
of the Georgia Bulldogs

32:53.199 --> 32:54.866
will be there one table away,

32:54.868 --> 32:56.450
prepared to take down the good doctor

32:56.452 --> 32:58.035
if things should get out of hand.

32:58.037 --> 33:00.190
And former FBI field agent

33:00.192 --> 33:02.623
Danielle James will also be there.

33:02.625 --> 33:03.958
They're having dinner together.

33:03.960 --> 33:06.093
Didn't even know you two were a thing.

33:06.095 --> 33:07.712
Well, I got to warn you,
I'm not a cheap date.

33:08.177 --> 33:09.388
Bull, look,

33:09.390 --> 33:12.884
seriously, how much jeopardy
are we putting this woman in?

33:12.886 --> 33:14.635
I'll be in her ear
telling her what to say,

33:14.637 --> 33:16.938
and you and Cable will be
sitting right by my side.

33:16.940 --> 33:19.140
And you really think
this has a chance of working?

33:19.142 --> 33:20.565
Mm.

33:20.860 --> 33:23.394
The more she flatters him,
the more she puffs him up,

33:23.777 --> 33:26.614
the more likely he is to make a mistake.

33:26.616 --> 33:29.150
His ego is his weakness.

33:29.616 --> 33:33.154
We need to play on that,
get him to confess to Annabelle.

33:33.156 --> 33:34.955
If he does...

33:36.039 --> 33:39.126
that confession is not protected.

33:39.128 --> 33:40.634
She is not his lawyer.

33:40.636 --> 33:42.713
She is not part of his legal team.

33:42.715 --> 33:44.215
That is not what I'm asking.

33:44.217 --> 33:45.549
Objects of delusion

33:45.551 --> 33:48.419
are usually only in danger
if they challenge the delusion...

33:48.421 --> 33:50.338
if she refuses his affection

33:50.340 --> 33:52.309
or humiliates him in some way.

33:52.311 --> 33:55.055
Well, what if Annabelle can't
handle it and does just that?

33:55.057 --> 33:57.561
That's why I have you and Chunk there.

33:57.563 --> 33:59.013
You're not just muscle.

33:59.015 --> 34:00.264
Benanti's never seen you before,

34:00.266 --> 34:02.516
so you will be my eyes
and ears on the ground.

34:02.518 --> 34:06.938
Okay, I'm not a lawyer yet,
but I know enough to know

34:06.940 --> 34:10.358
that this plan relies
on information obtained

34:10.360 --> 34:12.610
in the course of protected conversations

34:12.612 --> 34:15.112
between you and Dr. Benanti.

34:15.114 --> 34:17.114
I mean, conversations that are covered

34:17.116 --> 34:18.783
under attorney-client privilege.

34:19.248 --> 34:20.751
Yeah? So?

34:20.753 --> 34:23.704
So... is this legal?

34:24.706 --> 34:26.958
Legal? Oh.

34:26.960 --> 34:30.127
Here's the thing. It's not criminal.

34:30.129 --> 34:32.596
And you won't go to jail.

34:32.598 --> 34:35.716
And I will pay any fines or judgments.

34:35.717 --> 34:37.467
Now, ask me

34:37.469 --> 34:39.303
if it's the right thing to do.

34:40.437 --> 34:41.973
I don't have to.

34:42.563 --> 34:43.940
I know it is.

34:43.943 --> 34:46.310
Anyone want to opt out?

34:48.777 --> 34:50.898
Then turn off your cell
phones, ladies and gentlemen.

34:50.900 --> 34:53.617
Our feature attraction is about to begin.

35:00.499 --> 35:02.243
Still no sign of her.

35:02.772 --> 35:04.043
Relax, everybody.

35:04.045 --> 35:06.171
The driver's just pulling up
to the restaurant.

35:16.843 --> 35:18.342
You've got the recorder?

35:19.184 --> 35:20.594
I do.

35:20.596 --> 35:22.179
I do, and it's on.

35:22.181 --> 35:24.348
And you still feel up to this?

35:24.856 --> 35:26.134
Yes, I do.

35:26.136 --> 35:27.651
Just remember, I've got people there.

35:27.653 --> 35:29.570
You don't need to know who they are.

35:30.076 --> 35:32.323
You just need to know
that they are close by.

35:32.697 --> 35:34.191
And I am watching.

35:34.658 --> 35:36.160
So if anything goes awry,

35:36.162 --> 35:37.995
don't worry, you're protected.

35:38.578 --> 35:40.948
Do as I say, and say as I say.

35:40.950 --> 35:42.249
Trust me.

35:42.251 --> 35:45.036
I do. I-I'm here, aren't I?

35:55.762 --> 35:57.131
Here she comes.

36:05.063 --> 36:06.690
Thank you.

36:07.107 --> 36:08.809
Bull, you'd be proud of her.

36:09.484 --> 36:10.895
She's putting on quite a show.

36:12.398 --> 36:14.365
My God, look at you.

36:14.367 --> 36:15.900
You're glowing.

36:15.902 --> 36:17.785
Wow. He really is crazy, isn't he?

36:18.201 --> 36:19.904
Dr. Benanti, I'm...

36:19.906 --> 36:21.789
I'm in mourning.

36:21.791 --> 36:24.875
Well, whatever you're in, it becomes you.

36:25.875 --> 36:27.244
I know it's hard,

36:27.719 --> 36:29.889
but smile, seem flattered.

36:30.509 --> 36:31.693
Call him "Don""

36:31.695 --> 36:33.384
not "Doctor," and lean in when he talks.

36:33.386 --> 36:36.170
He's an expert
at picking up nonverbal cues.

36:36.172 --> 36:38.422
Wow. She's sitting
on the edge of her seat.

36:38.424 --> 36:39.757
Her eyes are glued to his.

36:39.759 --> 36:41.175
I think I'm jealous.

36:41.177 --> 36:44.011
Loosen him up. Apologize for the trial.

36:44.013 --> 36:47.014
I just, I just have
to say again how sorry I am

36:47.016 --> 36:49.190
about everything that's happened.

36:49.983 --> 36:52.937
You know, if it were up to me,
I never would have sued,

36:52.939 --> 36:54.772
but Sherryl Milton, she...

36:55.280 --> 36:56.690
she insisted.

36:56.692 --> 36:58.581
Don't you think I sensed that?

36:58.583 --> 36:59.777
Now, I know this isn't something

36:59.779 --> 37:01.829
you want to do, but we need to build up

37:01.831 --> 37:04.281
his confidence and get him
to let down his defenses.

37:04.831 --> 37:06.617
Do you think you could
reach across the table

37:06.619 --> 37:08.460
and touch his hand?

37:13.632 --> 37:15.126
Danny, Chunk,

37:15.128 --> 37:17.461
from where you are, can you tell
if she's touching his hand?

37:17.463 --> 37:18.803
Not yet.

37:19.804 --> 37:21.799
Oh, wait a second.

37:21.801 --> 37:24.051
The answer to your question is yes.

37:26.689 --> 37:28.229
Thank you.

37:32.567 --> 37:33.811
To you.

37:34.194 --> 37:35.396
To destiny.

37:36.488 --> 37:39.268
Now, Annabelle, I need you to repeat

37:39.270 --> 37:41.402
what I'm about to say as if it's yours.

37:41.404 --> 37:43.571
Okay? Here we go.

37:44.245 --> 37:45.990
I know this isn't a session...

37:45.992 --> 37:47.708
I know this isn't a session,

37:47.710 --> 37:49.877
and I know we're not here to talk about

37:49.879 --> 37:51.836
me and my problems, but...

37:53.088 --> 37:55.332
can I tell you a deep, dark secret?

37:55.924 --> 37:58.551
You can tell me anything.

37:59.803 --> 38:02.555
I know I'm supposed to be sad,

38:02.925 --> 38:04.557
and I know I'm...

38:05.228 --> 38:07.311
I'm supposed to be grieving...

38:08.756 --> 38:11.182
...but deep down,
what I've, what I've really felt

38:11.184 --> 38:14.776
since that man shot Brady is...

38:16.528 --> 38:18.022
relief.

38:19.906 --> 38:21.825
Does that make me a bad person?

38:22.909 --> 38:24.361
No.

38:24.786 --> 38:26.947
It makes you someone
who put up with a partner

38:26.949 --> 38:29.999
who made the business
of living difficult.

38:31.420 --> 38:34.088
He was a big, suffocating personality.

38:34.090 --> 38:36.257
Of course it feels better now.

38:36.259 --> 38:39.009
Would you think I was a horrible
person if I told you I...

38:39.011 --> 38:41.712
Sometimes I fantasize...

38:41.928 --> 38:44.632
about thanking that fellow Lex...

38:46.769 --> 38:48.936
...the one who shot my husband...

38:49.811 --> 38:51.555
Uh, we are at DEFCON 4, guys.

38:51.557 --> 38:55.276
If something's gonna happen,
it's gonna happen now.

38:55.278 --> 38:56.527
For what he did.

38:56.529 --> 38:57.945
...for what he did,

38:57.947 --> 39:01.899
for... giving me my life back.

39:03.569 --> 39:05.402
For setting me free.

39:13.710 --> 39:15.275
Is everything all right, Don?

39:16.588 --> 39:18.382
Did I, did I say something to upset you?

39:18.384 --> 39:20.000
I-I mean...

39:20.002 --> 39:23.003
I just... I just think it's so amazing.

39:23.005 --> 39:26.890
If Lex hadn't done what he did...

39:27.977 --> 39:30.010
we wouldn't be here tonight.

39:38.443 --> 39:40.271
It wasn't Lex.

39:41.529 --> 39:42.773
What are you talking about?

39:44.157 --> 39:46.026
What are you talking about?

39:47.997 --> 39:49.412
Thank me.

39:51.372 --> 39:52.602
It was me.

39:52.604 --> 39:55.202
I mean, I didn't pull the trigger,

39:55.204 --> 39:59.456
but... I knew I could get Lex to.

40:01.299 --> 40:03.009
I gave him my gun...

40:04.761 --> 40:06.430
told him what to do.

40:09.802 --> 40:11.976
I did this for you.

40:13.306 --> 40:14.972
I did it for us.

40:21.447 --> 40:24.531
Marissa... something's going on.

40:25.198 --> 40:26.400
I think Annabelle might lose it.

40:28.788 --> 40:30.995
You-you need to talk Annabelle down.

40:31.324 --> 40:33.457
Annabelle, I need you to breathe.

40:33.873 --> 40:35.326
I need you to stay calm.

40:35.328 --> 40:36.744
Excuse yourself if you have to.

40:36.746 --> 40:37.995
Annabelle, I don't understand.

40:37.997 --> 40:39.880
Why are you crying?

40:39.882 --> 40:41.465
No, don't order till I get back!

40:43.085 --> 40:45.336
Oh, my goodness, I'm so sorry, I'm sorry.

40:45.338 --> 40:46.837
- What have you done?
- ‭Oh, my gosh.

40:46.839 --> 40:48.756
- Let's get you cleaned up.
- Oh, honey, I know.

40:48.758 --> 40:50.507
- I'm sorry.
- Belinda, look what you've done.

40:50.509 --> 40:52.259
- Wait.
- ‭I'm so sorry.

40:52.261 --> 40:54.094
This is terrible. You have to
let me pay for your dinner.

40:54.096 --> 40:56.146
No, that's not necessary.
If I, if I could just...

40:56.148 --> 40:57.648
But I insist.

40:57.650 --> 41:00.351
How much Bob De Niro you think
we're looking at here?

41:00.353 --> 41:02.102
- Huh? Oh.
- ‭I have no idea.

41:02.104 --> 41:03.854
I'd say it's pretty significant.

41:03.856 --> 41:07.074
Looks like we've done
quite a bit of damage.

41:07.076 --> 41:09.993
Yeah, we think you did, too.

41:24.424 --> 41:26.009
Forgive me, Don.

41:26.011 --> 41:27.711
I know it looks like I came empty-handed,

41:27.713 --> 41:31.215
but I actually brought
a lovely '89 Haut-Brion.

41:31.217 --> 41:33.217
Would have paired brilliantly
with those chips

41:33.219 --> 41:35.886
out from the vending machine, but alas,

41:35.888 --> 41:38.555
the guards did not share my enthusiasm.

41:38.980 --> 41:41.191
- What are you doing here?
- I don't know.

41:41.193 --> 41:43.610
I guess I'm just that kind of guy.

41:43.612 --> 41:46.447
The kind of guy that goes
out on a limb for a friend.

41:46.449 --> 41:47.898
The kind of guy that shows up

41:47.900 --> 41:49.700
when a colleague calls and asks for help.

41:49.702 --> 41:51.869
The kind of guy that visits you in jail

41:51.871 --> 41:53.703
when you've been denied bail.

41:54.240 --> 41:56.373
But I guess it could be worse.

41:56.375 --> 41:57.708
Lots of natural light.

41:57.710 --> 41:59.543
And you look pretty good in khaki.

41:59.545 --> 42:02.796
Go ahead, take your victory lap.

42:02.798 --> 42:04.748
But I'm not an idiot.

42:04.750 --> 42:07.801
I know you're the reason
I'm in here, and I'll prove it.

42:07.803 --> 42:09.303
- And when I do...
- ‭

42:09.305 --> 42:12.423
I'm sorry, prove what, exactly?

42:12.425 --> 42:14.258
That I suggested Annabelle ask you out

42:14.260 --> 42:15.726
and record the conversation?

42:15.728 --> 42:18.762
Even if you could prove that...
and it will be awfully hard

42:18.764 --> 42:20.514
to do that from prison...

42:20.516 --> 42:22.433
and it still wouldn't change the fact

42:22.435 --> 42:24.435
that you confessed on tape

42:24.437 --> 42:25.519
to orchestrating murder.

42:25.521 --> 42:27.271
And it still wouldn't change the fact

42:27.273 --> 42:29.773
that the police found
the lockbox in your office

42:29.775 --> 42:31.742
and matched your fingerprint
to the partial print

42:31.744 --> 42:33.110
they found on the gun

42:33.112 --> 42:34.495
from the crime scene.

42:34.497 --> 42:36.663
No, all it would do is

42:36.665 --> 42:38.665
give you the opportunity to sue me.

42:38.667 --> 42:41.702
Again, from prison. And you'd lose.

42:41.704 --> 42:43.704
And even if you didn't,

42:43.706 --> 42:45.205
I don't think my professional reputation

42:45.207 --> 42:47.624
would take too big a hit
if I was found liable

42:47.626 --> 42:51.879
for protecting the world
from a complete psychopath.

42:54.383 --> 42:57.768
Well, I should get back to the office.

43:04.976 --> 43:06.509
There.

43:08.695 --> 43:10.564
Don't want you to think
the visit was a total loss.
