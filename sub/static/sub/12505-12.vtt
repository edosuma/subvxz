00:05.606 --> 00:07.508
[Kaylie] Previously on
Make It Or Break It:

00:07.541 --> 00:09.577
[Austin] It's the disease,
the anorexia.

00:09.610 --> 00:11.245
[Maeve] I don't belong here
either, Kaylie.

00:11.279 --> 00:14.182
It's called acting.
I've got it pretty wired.

00:14.215 --> 00:16.550
And I can help you get out.

00:16.584 --> 00:18.386
[Damon] I should be in LA
focusing on my album.

00:18.419 --> 00:20.621
Neither of us
want to say goodbye.

00:20.654 --> 00:23.724
We were wondering what
the status of Emily's
World Team membership is.

00:23.757 --> 00:26.094
That hasn't been decided yet.

00:26.127 --> 00:28.329
[Lauren] I need you to get
back together with my dad.

00:28.362 --> 00:30.564
I know my dad still loves you.

00:30.598 --> 00:32.366
Can't you just give it
another chance?

00:32.400 --> 00:34.335
Did you leave that picture
of Payson kissing Sasha

00:34.368 --> 00:36.570
- to Ellen Beals?
- Absolutely not.

00:36.604 --> 00:38.539
If I ever find out who did,

00:38.572 --> 00:40.108
they'll be out of this gym.

00:47.481 --> 00:49.717
You've gained three pounds.

00:51.419 --> 00:52.586
Isn't that wonderful?

00:59.493 --> 01:03.030
I've gained three pounds.
And they think it's wonderful.

01:03.063 --> 01:04.498
They're destroying my chances
to go to Worlds,

01:04.532 --> 01:06.767
maybe even
the Olympics.

01:06.800 --> 01:08.569
- Copy that. I've got
Fashion Week next month.
- [thunder rumbling]

01:08.602 --> 01:11.172
And you hear that thunder?
It's my thighs!

01:11.205 --> 01:14.708
Art therapy is a way
to express oneself

01:14.742 --> 01:17.178
authentically
and spontaneously.

01:17.211 --> 01:19.780
- So is purging.
- Maeve...

01:19.813 --> 01:21.615
I see you're
expressing yourself
with the color red.

01:21.649 --> 01:23.717
Can you connect that
with a feeling?

01:25.853 --> 01:28.689
Rage. At myself,

01:28.722 --> 01:30.591
for not being perfect.

01:30.624 --> 01:33.661
Very interesting.
And Kaylie?

01:33.694 --> 01:35.796
Your canvas is blank.

01:35.829 --> 01:38.732
Yes. Um...

01:38.766 --> 01:44.472
Can you tell me what
that might represent?

01:44.505 --> 01:46.674
The, uh...

01:46.707 --> 01:51.111
[stammering] The emptiness
I feel inside,

01:51.145 --> 01:54.582
that I need to
fill with food.

01:54.615 --> 01:55.616
And self-esteem.

02:00.254 --> 02:02.456
OK, your dialogue sucks.

02:02.490 --> 02:04.258
Here's a script:
"I have a problem,

02:04.292 --> 02:06.627
I'm filled with regret and I'm
committed to getting well."

02:06.660 --> 02:08.696
- I did that!
- You can't just say it.

02:08.729 --> 02:11.232
You've gotta sell it.
I can help you
get out of here,

02:11.265 --> 02:13.501
but you've got to bring
the Oscar-worthy waterworks,

02:13.534 --> 02:16.237
especially in the evaluation
with your parents.

02:16.270 --> 02:18.339
- Can you do that?
- Yeah, fine.

02:18.372 --> 02:20.241
I'll do whatever it takes
to get me back training
at The Rock.

02:20.274 --> 02:21.642
OK.

02:31.319 --> 02:33.621
[Lauren groaning]

02:35.589 --> 02:38.426
- I'm dying.
- [Payson] OK, now, tuck.

02:38.459 --> 02:39.627
[both groaning]

02:39.660 --> 02:41.195
Even Sasha didn't
make us do these.

02:41.229 --> 02:42.630
Without Sasha here
to push us...

02:42.663 --> 02:44.598
We have to be
pushed by you?

02:44.632 --> 02:46.734
Payson?

02:46.767 --> 02:48.836
Can you help me
with my round-off?

02:48.869 --> 02:50.704
Yeah, sure.
Single-legs.

02:55.376 --> 02:57.211
Who died and
made her coach?

02:57.245 --> 03:00.648
Someone has to show
some leadership around here.

03:00.681 --> 03:04.218
Yeah, well, I'm not supposed
to say anything, but...

03:04.252 --> 03:06.754
Payson's poser days
are over.

03:06.787 --> 03:10.458
We have a new coach.
And she's starting today.

03:10.491 --> 03:12.660
She who?

03:12.693 --> 03:13.727
[giggles]

03:13.761 --> 03:15.396
Darby Conrad?

03:15.429 --> 03:17.698
She's a two-time Olympian
and a silver medalist.

03:17.731 --> 03:20.668
And she was an Olympic Team
assistant coach in Beijing.

03:20.701 --> 03:23.637
And she's like what? 26?

03:23.671 --> 03:26.640
Twenty-five, but she's
very mature and...

03:26.674 --> 03:28.576
Qualified?

03:28.609 --> 03:30.878
To coach three
elite gymnasts

03:30.911 --> 03:32.646
at a big club
like The Rock?

03:32.680 --> 03:34.448
The NGO recommends her.

03:34.482 --> 03:35.949
And this late into the season

03:35.983 --> 03:38.386
it's been impossible
to find an A-list coach

03:38.419 --> 03:40.254
who isn't under contract
to another club.

03:40.288 --> 03:42.656
You really think
after having Sasha,

03:42.690 --> 03:45.659
that the girls are going to
accept Darby as their coach?

03:45.693 --> 03:48.496
Lauren's very excited
about it.

03:48.529 --> 03:50.598
It's not Lauren
I'm worried about.

03:52.733 --> 03:56.236
That's the most
ridiculous thing
I've ever heard.

03:56.270 --> 03:57.905
I don't think she's joking.

03:57.938 --> 03:59.473
I think Darby
will be awesome.

03:59.507 --> 04:01.909
Of course you do.
She was your Big Sister
at NGO camp.

04:01.942 --> 04:03.811
They were inseparable.

04:03.844 --> 04:05.679
I'm sorry, make that
insufferable.

04:05.713 --> 04:08.849
Sounds like someone's
threatened that we might
finally have a coach

04:08.882 --> 04:10.651
who actually favors me
for once.

04:10.684 --> 04:13.621
Look, I respect Darby as a
gymnast, but as a head coach?

04:13.654 --> 04:15.589
I think we're better off
coaching ourselves.

04:15.623 --> 04:17.691
Don't you mean we're better off
with you coaching us?

04:17.725 --> 04:19.993
Last I checked, you weren't
an Olympic medalist, Pay.

04:20.027 --> 04:21.729
And it's too late.

04:21.762 --> 04:25.799
The contract is signed and
she will be here any minute.

04:31.972 --> 04:33.674
[gasps] Darbs!

04:33.707 --> 04:35.376
- [Lauren shrieking]
- Lo-Lo!

04:35.409 --> 04:37.745
- [both giggling]
- Lo-Lo?

04:37.778 --> 04:42.350
And from serious gym
to silly sorority.
Wow, just like that.

04:44.452 --> 04:47.688
[Steve chuckles] Hey, everybody,
can I have your attention?

04:47.721 --> 04:51.525
Although she
needs no introduction,

04:51.559 --> 04:54.728
I'd like you all to welcome
the new head coach of The Rock.

04:54.762 --> 04:59.367
Two-time Olympian
and silver medalist,
Darby Conrad.

04:59.400 --> 05:01.569
[all applauding]

05:01.602 --> 05:05.773
I'm sure that Darby
has a few words to say,

05:05.806 --> 05:09.443
so the floor is yours.

05:09.477 --> 05:11.278
Thank you, Mr. Tanner.

05:11.311 --> 05:14.648
And first of all, yay!

05:14.682 --> 05:17.685
I am so stoked to be here,

05:17.718 --> 05:19.553
at the very best gym
in the country,

05:19.587 --> 05:22.690
and in the presence of
three of the most talented,

05:22.723 --> 05:25.025
elite gymnasts in the world.

05:25.058 --> 05:26.727
And I trust you.

05:26.760 --> 05:28.629
So I'm not gonna be
imposing all these rules

05:28.662 --> 05:30.330
about whether y'all date,

05:30.364 --> 05:33.066
what y'all eat,
or hey, even what time

05:33.100 --> 05:34.468
you show up at the gym
in the morning.

05:34.502 --> 05:38.772
You are the masters
of your universe.

05:38.806 --> 05:45.413
And I bow to the powerful
Goddess within you all.

05:45.446 --> 05:47.114
Namaste.

05:49.817 --> 05:52.453
[applause]

05:56.824 --> 05:59.793
Still think she's just
what The Rock needs?

06:02.930 --> 06:04.798
[theme music playing]

06:27.855 --> 06:30.558
So, Kim and I
share this desk,

06:30.591 --> 06:33.427
and this is Sash...
I mean, your desk.

06:33.461 --> 06:35.496
Gosh, it's a little
tight in here.

06:35.529 --> 06:37.631
You and Sasha must have been
all over each other.

06:39.467 --> 06:43.471
So, any questions, concerns?

06:43.504 --> 06:45.806
I can't think of any.

06:45.839 --> 06:47.107
I can.

06:47.140 --> 06:50.444
Structure is important
for girls at this age,

06:50.478 --> 06:53.380
and they've always had
a strict starting time
in the morning.

06:53.413 --> 06:55.716
With all due respect,

06:55.749 --> 06:58.652
they're no longer "girls",
they're young women.

06:58.686 --> 07:01.154
And I trust them to
get to the gym on time

07:01.188 --> 07:02.556
because they choose to.

07:02.590 --> 07:07.094
Well, sometimes they make
the wrong choices.

07:07.127 --> 07:09.062
Which is why
I'm also concerned

07:09.096 --> 07:11.064
about lifting
the no-dating rule.

07:11.098 --> 07:13.066
We've had problems
in the past

07:13.100 --> 07:15.469
with girls fraternizing
with boys in the gym.

07:15.503 --> 07:17.170
So the rules are just there
to be broken?

07:17.204 --> 07:19.172
They're there
to set the bar

07:19.206 --> 07:20.874
for what's expected of them.

07:20.908 --> 07:25.045
A dedicated gymnast sets
her own bar higher every day.

07:25.078 --> 07:26.480
And I'm only here
to help her

07:26.514 --> 07:29.182
realize the expectations
she has for herself.

07:29.216 --> 07:32.019
Look, oppression
encourages rebellion.

07:32.052 --> 07:34.154
So, why not liberate
these young women

07:34.187 --> 07:37.758
and trust them
to make the right choices
for a change?

07:41.228 --> 07:44.064
Finally, a coach who won't be
treating us like children.

07:44.097 --> 07:45.833
We don't need a buddy,
we need a boss.

07:45.866 --> 07:48.602
Well, I think it's awesome we
have a coach we can relate to.

07:48.636 --> 07:51.171
And a woman.

07:51.204 --> 07:54.441
That way we don't have to worry
about you kissing her.

07:54.474 --> 07:58.445
Or do we? You haven't
shown much interest in boys,
at least not your own age.

07:58.478 --> 08:01.782
Because having a boyfriend has
been so good for your career.

08:01.815 --> 08:04.718
Payson, Carter had
a zero effect on
my gymnastics.

08:04.752 --> 08:06.086
I only dumped him
because I wanted

08:06.119 --> 08:07.187
to save my friendship
with Kaylie.

08:07.220 --> 08:09.056
After you slept with him
a few hundred times.

08:09.089 --> 08:12.793
Says the Ice Princess.
Do you really think

08:12.826 --> 08:15.162
Damon's gonna wait around until
2012 to have sex with you?

08:15.195 --> 08:18.165
I think it's none
of your business.

08:18.198 --> 08:21.234
Just saying, you're not gonna be
on house arrest forever.

08:21.268 --> 08:23.203
Actually,
my probation officer

08:23.236 --> 08:25.238
has been so impressed
with my compliance,

08:25.272 --> 08:27.808
that as of today,
I am a free woman.

08:27.841 --> 08:29.476
That's great, Emily!

08:29.509 --> 08:31.511
And thanks to Darby,
free to see Damon

08:31.545 --> 08:32.946
without breaking the rules.

08:32.980 --> 08:35.515
Except he's in LA
recording his album.

08:35.549 --> 08:37.685
I don't get it.

08:37.718 --> 08:40.988
Damon is always there
to bail you out, literally,

08:41.021 --> 08:42.790
and supports you in
everything you do.

08:42.823 --> 08:45.092
He even borrowed
a tour bus,

08:45.125 --> 08:46.560
and took it
across the country

08:46.594 --> 08:47.861
so that your brother
could see you at Nationals,

08:47.895 --> 08:50.530
and what is it exactly
that you do for him?

08:50.564 --> 08:53.133
- Hey!
- Hi!

08:53.166 --> 08:56.136
Emily, I wanted to
personally introduce myself.

08:56.169 --> 08:59.873
I'm a really big fan.

08:59.907 --> 09:03.510
And Payson, I've
worshipped you forever.

09:03.543 --> 09:04.612
Oh, God.

09:06.146 --> 09:07.648
You guys, I'm so pumped
to be here!

09:07.681 --> 09:09.650
We're gonna rock
the gymnastics world!

09:09.683 --> 09:12.252
Right on!
And as our team captain

09:12.285 --> 09:16.924
I wanted you to think of me
as your second-in-command.

09:16.957 --> 09:19.159
And I have a lot of ideas to
improve things around here.

09:19.192 --> 09:22.195
Like a private dressing room for
the number one girl at The Rock,

09:22.229 --> 09:24.264
which just happens to be me
at the moment.

09:24.297 --> 09:27.134
And I feel like we need
to change things up
with the colors.

09:27.167 --> 09:29.036
I was thinking,
you know, brighter,

09:29.069 --> 09:31.905
- hot pinks,
passionate purples.
- Love!

09:31.939 --> 09:33.674
Excuse me, since when
are you the team captain?

09:33.707 --> 09:36.309
Since, with Kaylie out,
I'm number one at The Rock.

09:36.343 --> 09:38.578
- Says who?
- I'm ranked higher

09:38.612 --> 09:39.980
than both of you
on the World Team.

09:40.013 --> 09:42.916
That's if Emily's even
still on the World Team.

09:42.950 --> 09:44.317
Any word yet?

09:44.351 --> 09:47.054
Um, no. Not yet.

09:47.087 --> 09:48.922
[Darby] Hey, I know
all about it, Em.

09:48.956 --> 09:51.992
And I blame our screwed-up
health care system.

09:52.025 --> 09:53.226
Power to the people!

09:53.260 --> 09:55.595
Still, she
is a convicted felon,

09:55.629 --> 09:58.265
and I don't think she's the best
candidate for team captain.

09:58.298 --> 10:00.133
What about Payson?

10:00.167 --> 10:02.736
She was team captain
before Kaylie,

10:02.770 --> 10:04.237
and all of the girls
respect her.

10:04.271 --> 10:05.939
What, they don't
respect me?

10:05.973 --> 10:08.308
If Sasha was here, he'd
have us compete for it.

10:08.341 --> 10:09.710
Well, he's not here.

10:09.743 --> 10:11.845
Are you afraid
you might lose?

10:11.879 --> 10:13.113
Darby is the coach,

10:13.146 --> 10:14.314
so I think she should choose.

10:14.347 --> 10:15.348
Darby?

10:20.754 --> 10:22.189
You know what,
I have an idea.

10:22.222 --> 10:25.926
Why don't we empower everyone
on this decision? Hmm?

10:25.959 --> 10:28.729
OK, everybody
gather around.

10:33.133 --> 10:35.936
Now, we're trying to
pick your team captain,

10:35.969 --> 10:37.905
and it's between
Payson and Lauren.

10:37.938 --> 10:41.141
Now, I can either decide,
or they can compete for it.

10:41.174 --> 10:46.113
So, all those in favor of me
choosing, raise your hands

10:46.146 --> 10:47.647
OK.

10:47.681 --> 10:50.784
And all in favor of Payson
and Lauren competing for it...

10:52.219 --> 10:54.321
Hmm. Perfect!

10:54.354 --> 10:57.390
Tomorrow, we'll have a mini-meet
on beam, bars and vault.

10:57.424 --> 10:59.359
Good with me.

10:59.392 --> 11:01.028
Will you be judging
at least?

11:01.061 --> 11:03.330
I think it's important for me
to stay neutral,

11:03.363 --> 11:06.399
but I'm sure
the assistant coaches
will be happy to judge.

11:06.433 --> 11:08.135
Ah, this is so exciting!

11:08.168 --> 11:10.270
A big competition
on my first day!

11:10.303 --> 11:14.307
So, I'll be here
and ready to roll at 7AM,

11:14.341 --> 11:16.710
and I'll see y'all
whenever I see ya.

11:22.215 --> 11:23.717
You have to win.

11:23.751 --> 11:25.886
Lauren as team captain
is a fate worse than death.

11:25.919 --> 11:27.354
Don't worry, I won't let
Lauren and her father

11:27.387 --> 11:29.156
take total control
of The Rock.

11:30.190 --> 11:31.925
[phone beeping]

11:31.959 --> 11:33.660
Oh, my gosh!

11:33.693 --> 11:34.661
What?

11:34.694 --> 11:36.463
Damon is back in Boulder.

11:38.431 --> 11:39.767
[phone beeps]

11:39.800 --> 11:42.002
And you know what
the best part is?

11:42.035 --> 11:43.837
For the first time ever,

11:43.871 --> 11:46.406
I can see him and it's not
breaking any rules.

11:48.075 --> 11:52.012
I'll see you tomorrow
around 7.

11:52.045 --> 11:54.314
Come on, Darbs.
Let's see if you still got it.

11:54.347 --> 11:56.049
Whoo! [giggling]

11:56.083 --> 11:57.450
[girls applauding]

12:19.940 --> 12:20.941
Yay!

12:32.519 --> 12:36.189
I acknowledge that I'm sick.

12:36.223 --> 12:39.259
That my addiction
to perfection

12:39.292 --> 12:42.129
caused me to have
a distorted body image.

12:42.162 --> 12:44.731
And I regret
that I hurt myself.

12:44.764 --> 12:48.401
And I know that recovery
is a life long battle,

12:48.435 --> 12:51.171
but I'm determined
to stay healthy,

12:51.204 --> 12:55.342
and love myself and my body
just the way I am.

12:55.375 --> 12:57.878
Congratulations, Kaylie.

12:57.911 --> 12:59.412
Admitting that
you have a problem

12:59.446 --> 13:01.348
is the first step
to recovery.

13:01.381 --> 13:03.016
And I do want to recover.

13:04.117 --> 13:06.119
Well, Kaylie is lucky
that we caught this

13:06.153 --> 13:08.188
before she did
any irreparable damage

13:08.221 --> 13:09.756
to her heart or her organs.

13:09.789 --> 13:11.791
But she's not
out of the woods.

13:11.825 --> 13:14.761
But I've gained weight,
and I feel so great.

13:14.794 --> 13:16.229
Which is why I think
you can go home.

13:16.263 --> 13:19.232
However, I am
going to recommend

13:19.266 --> 13:22.335
that you continue with
an outpatient program
in Boulder.

13:22.369 --> 13:24.371
- Six days a week.
- Six days a week?

13:24.404 --> 13:25.472
How will she train?

13:25.505 --> 13:28.108
- She won't.
- What?

13:28.141 --> 13:30.978
I strongly believe
taking a break from gymnastics

13:31.011 --> 13:34.347
is essential to your health,
maybe even your life.

13:34.381 --> 13:36.783
Absolutely. She won't
go back to The Rock

13:36.816 --> 13:38.318
until we know she's well.

13:38.351 --> 13:40.320
Mom, what am I
supposed to do,
sit on my butt

13:40.353 --> 13:42.455
and watch everything
I've worked for slip away?

13:42.489 --> 13:45.325
You can use this time to
develop other interests.

13:45.358 --> 13:48.495
Finding a passion
aside from gymnastics

13:48.528 --> 13:51.031
might help to release
some of the pressure you feel

13:51.064 --> 13:53.400
to be perfect.

13:53.433 --> 13:56.336
[mother] What about music?

13:56.369 --> 13:59.006
I had a pretty successful
recording career,

13:59.039 --> 14:01.308
and Kaylie, you have
a great voice.

14:01.341 --> 14:03.911
Maybe it could be something
we do together,

14:03.944 --> 14:05.312
as mother and daughter.

14:05.345 --> 14:06.313
I hate singing.

14:06.346 --> 14:09.382
Many of our patients
find art therapy

14:09.416 --> 14:11.251
is both healing
and cathartic.

14:11.284 --> 14:14.054
Great. I'll do art.
But I've to get back
to The Rock.

14:14.087 --> 14:15.288
Worlds are right around
the corner.

14:15.322 --> 14:17.925
I cannot in good conscience
release you,

14:17.958 --> 14:21.494
unless you agree that you
will pursue outside interests,

14:21.528 --> 14:24.831
and suspend training, I mean
at least for the time being.

14:24.864 --> 14:26.333
Can't she train part-time?

14:26.366 --> 14:28.969
Alex, a few weeks
won't kill her,

14:29.002 --> 14:30.370
but this disease might.

14:30.403 --> 14:31.871
Mom, this is not
your decision.

14:31.905 --> 14:34.574
I have stood by and watched
you push your body to the limit

14:34.607 --> 14:36.109
since you were
8-years old.

14:36.143 --> 14:38.378
And look where it's
gotten you.

14:38.411 --> 14:40.080
You're not an athlete.
You don't understand.

14:40.113 --> 14:41.348
But I'm your mother,
and from now on,

14:41.381 --> 14:43.116
I'll decide
what's best for you.

15:00.533 --> 15:01.868
[laughs delightedly]

15:01.901 --> 15:03.303
Hey.

15:04.404 --> 15:06.106
What are you doing back?

15:06.139 --> 15:08.141
You're supposed to be in LA
recording your album.

15:08.175 --> 15:10.910
Yeah, well, I was.
And I am.

15:10.944 --> 15:14.314
Recording my album,
or at least, trying to.

15:14.347 --> 15:16.449
What's wrong?

15:16.483 --> 15:20.520
Everything that I've written
just... sucks.

15:20.553 --> 15:22.422
[chuckles]
I don't believe that.

15:22.455 --> 15:24.191
You're just being hard
on yourself.

15:24.224 --> 15:26.126
Well, the label believes it.

15:26.159 --> 15:27.995
And they want to know
why these new songs

15:28.028 --> 15:30.430
aren't as good as the ones
that I wrote here in Boulder.

15:30.463 --> 15:34.267
And the worst part is,
I've gone through most
of my recording advance.

15:34.301 --> 15:38.171
Studio space in LA
is so crazy expensive.

15:38.205 --> 15:40.340
I don't even know how
I'm going to afford
to finish this album.

15:40.373 --> 15:43.243
The one thing I do know...

15:43.276 --> 15:45.278
is I'm gonna finish it here.

15:45.312 --> 15:46.579
Can you do that?

15:46.613 --> 15:50.650
Well, it was here that I was
inspired in the first place.

15:50.683 --> 15:52.685
By you.

15:52.719 --> 15:56.956
And look, I know you have
to focus on gymnastics

15:56.990 --> 15:58.291
and you can't see me.

15:58.325 --> 16:00.460
But just being in
the same city as you...

16:00.493 --> 16:02.395
[inhales] What can I say?

16:02.429 --> 16:04.964
You're, uh...
you're my muse.

16:04.998 --> 16:08.068
Well, guess what?

16:09.269 --> 16:11.404
You can see me.

16:11.438 --> 16:14.141
My P.O. lifted
all of my restrictions,

16:14.174 --> 16:16.209
and I'm a free woman.

16:16.243 --> 16:19.146
[stammering] That's great!

16:19.179 --> 16:20.513
But what about
The Rock rules?

16:20.547 --> 16:22.049
There aren't any.

16:22.082 --> 16:25.218
Our new coach doesn't care
what we do outside of the gym.

16:25.252 --> 16:27.954
So, we can finally be together.

16:27.987 --> 16:31.491
I can't even tell you
how great this is.

16:31.524 --> 16:35.728
[stammering] And listen, I don't
want to put pressure on you,

16:35.762 --> 16:37.630
it's just that...

16:37.664 --> 16:39.732
I really need you right now.

16:39.766 --> 16:43.103
You've let me need you
since the moment I met you.

16:43.136 --> 16:46.206
And I would love to be
your muse.

16:46.239 --> 16:48.441
Has anybody ever told you

16:48.475 --> 16:51.378
that you are the most
amazing girl in the world?

16:51.411 --> 16:54.214
Um... Not lately.

16:54.247 --> 16:55.448
Hmm.

16:55.482 --> 16:57.184
Well, you are.

17:02.021 --> 17:04.724
[knock at door]

17:04.757 --> 17:07.427
Hello, doll.
I just came
to say good night,

17:07.460 --> 17:10.197
and it's so awesome of y'all
to let me stay here
until I find a place.

17:10.230 --> 17:12.099
I love that you're here.

17:12.132 --> 17:14.367
It's like having a slumber party
every single night.

17:14.401 --> 17:15.535
- Yay!
- Yay!

17:15.568 --> 17:17.470
Oh, hey, listen.

17:17.504 --> 17:18.638
I just think
you should know that,

17:18.671 --> 17:20.573
Payson's really not happy
you're here.

17:20.607 --> 17:22.775
In fact, she thinks
we'd be better off

17:22.809 --> 17:26.113
coaching ourselves and she
hasn't made any secret of it.

17:26.146 --> 17:29.182
Well, I'm sure this is
very hard for Payson.

17:29.216 --> 17:31.451
She had a special relationship
with Sasha.

17:31.484 --> 17:34.053
If, by special,
you mean inappropriate.

17:34.087 --> 17:36.389
OK, those rumors are true?

17:37.557 --> 17:40.493
Well, he was caught
on tape kissing her.

17:41.528 --> 17:43.130
Poor Payson.

17:43.163 --> 17:45.332
I don't know.

17:45.365 --> 17:47.467
She got all his attention and
he practically forced the NGO

17:47.500 --> 17:48.601
to put her on
the World Team.

17:48.635 --> 17:50.503
I just don't want
to see you end up

17:50.537 --> 17:52.739
with a team captain who
honestly doesn't respect you.

17:52.772 --> 17:55.442
I appreciate that, Lo.

17:55.475 --> 17:57.577
You know, this job
is a huge step up.

17:57.610 --> 17:59.779
It's the big time.

17:59.812 --> 18:01.381
And I'm sure Payson
will come around

18:01.414 --> 18:03.683
once she sees that
I'm not here to take over.

18:06.786 --> 18:10.190
I will never accept
Darby Conrad as my coach.

18:10.223 --> 18:14.427
I know she's no Sasha,
but she must have

18:14.461 --> 18:16.729
learned something about
coaching along the way.

18:16.763 --> 18:19.666
She's in over her head,
she's indecisive

18:19.699 --> 18:22.335
- and I...
- You, what?

18:22.369 --> 18:25.605
I would make a better
coach than her.

18:25.638 --> 18:28.107
- You're 16.
- So I'm told.

18:28.141 --> 18:30.377
I think it's important

18:30.410 --> 18:33.613
that you give Darby a chance,
that you show her
some respect.

18:33.646 --> 18:36.349
I think it's important
that I beat Lauren tomorrow,

18:36.383 --> 18:37.717
so that I'm team captain,

18:37.750 --> 18:39.819
and The Rock doesn't
completely fall apart.

18:39.852 --> 18:43.423
Honey, I know you feel
responsible for Sasha leaving.

18:43.456 --> 18:44.791
But you're not.

18:44.824 --> 18:47.460
And you don't have to try
to make it up to everyone.

18:47.494 --> 18:50.430
Besides, Summer says
Steve's changed,

18:50.463 --> 18:53.099
and wants to play fair by
all the girls from now on.

18:53.132 --> 18:55.368
Yeah, right. Did he
play fair with Sasha?

18:55.402 --> 18:58.338
It's obvious he
bought Darby for Lauren

18:58.371 --> 19:00.440
and I'm not gonna let them
take over my gym.

19:00.473 --> 19:03.510
Steve, you didn't hire Darby

19:03.543 --> 19:06.546
in an attempt to buy back
Lauren's love, did you?

19:07.914 --> 19:09.782
I'd like to think
she still loves me.

19:09.816 --> 19:13.353
And no, I didn't.
You saw the limited choices
we had,

19:13.386 --> 19:16.423
and we wouldn't
have been scrambling
for a coach mid-season

19:16.456 --> 19:19.259
if your ex-boyfriend
hadn't up and left,

19:19.292 --> 19:21.428
in breach of his contract,
I might add.

19:23.430 --> 19:25.532
I'm sorry.

19:25.565 --> 19:26.799
I shouldn't have said that.

19:26.833 --> 19:29.869
It's no secret
you wanted him gone.

19:29.902 --> 19:33.273
I had concerns about Sasha,
as a coach.

19:33.306 --> 19:34.707
Not as my boyfriend?

19:34.741 --> 19:37.277
Where is this coming from?

19:37.310 --> 19:40.780
Kim doesn't believe
that you had nothing to do

19:40.813 --> 19:42.549
with leaking that tape
to Ellen Beals.

19:42.582 --> 19:44.917
I only care
what you believe.

19:44.951 --> 19:48.288
Well, I want to believe
you had nothing to do with it.

19:48.321 --> 19:50.323
And you can.

19:50.357 --> 19:52.825
Look, I know I destroyed
your faith in me

19:52.859 --> 19:54.527
when I lied to you about
Lauren's mother.

19:54.561 --> 19:56.563
I ruined everything
between us.

19:56.596 --> 20:01.834
But before that,
we had something special.
Didn't we?

20:01.868 --> 20:04.537
I thought we did.

20:04.571 --> 20:10.877
You know, when I interviewed you
to be my personal assistant,

20:10.910 --> 20:13.880
I almost didn't hire you.

20:13.913 --> 20:16.716
- Why?
- Because I thought,

20:16.749 --> 20:20.520
this is exactly the kind of girl
I've always wanted to marry,

20:20.553 --> 20:24.891
but if she gets to know every
intimate detail of my life,

20:24.924 --> 20:27.494
if she gets to know
the real me,

20:27.527 --> 20:29.529
she'll run screaming.

20:29.562 --> 20:32.465
I don't know why
you'd think that.

20:32.499 --> 20:33.766
You were very charming.

20:33.800 --> 20:37.404
But I wasn't
good enough for you.

20:37.437 --> 20:40.607
And I knew it, deep inside.

20:40.640 --> 20:43.476
But I know I can be
worthy of you now

20:43.510 --> 20:47.414
if you'll give me
another chance.

20:47.447 --> 20:50.917
Look... I know how much

20:50.950 --> 20:54.220
you want to start a family,
and I want more kids.

20:54.253 --> 20:56.423
We made a great team before.

20:56.456 --> 20:58.291
And now that I've changed,

20:58.325 --> 21:00.393
we can be even better.

21:00.427 --> 21:03.296
Steve, if I give this
another chance,

21:03.330 --> 21:05.598
you have to promise me

21:05.632 --> 21:07.367
you will never
lie to me again.

21:07.400 --> 21:09.402
That you'll be honest
about everything,

21:09.436 --> 21:12.305
no matter what you think
the consequences will be.

21:12.339 --> 21:13.773
I promise.

21:15.642 --> 21:17.410
I need you, Summer.

21:17.444 --> 21:21.280
When you're not here,
Lauren barely speaks to me,

21:21.314 --> 21:24.551
and she needs the mother
I robbed her of.

21:24.584 --> 21:27.520
I give you my word to God,

21:27.554 --> 21:30.723
I will not hurt either one
of you ever again.

21:33.493 --> 21:34.794
OK.

21:36.563 --> 21:37.930
OK?

21:46.973 --> 21:48.608
Lauren, get in here!

21:48.641 --> 21:52.379
I can't wait to tell her.
She's gonna be so happy.

21:56.883 --> 21:58.485
What's up?

21:58.518 --> 22:00.787
Yeah, it's, uh...

22:00.820 --> 22:04.724
It's official.
We're... back together.

22:04.757 --> 22:06.726
You're getting married!

22:06.759 --> 22:09.295
One step at a time, Lauren.

22:09.328 --> 22:10.630
Well, if you're back together,

22:10.663 --> 22:12.432
then, of course,
you're getting married.

22:12.465 --> 22:15.868
And... [sighs] Summer,
you can finally be my mom.

22:20.607 --> 22:23.376
Thank you, Daddy.

22:31.384 --> 22:35.688
[Damon] "Star light
star bright

22:35.722 --> 22:39.358
The first star
I see tonight

22:39.392 --> 22:42.429
I wish I may
I wish I might

22:42.462 --> 22:46.833
Have the wish
I wish tonight"

22:48.868 --> 22:52.004
OK, your turn.

22:53.806 --> 22:56.543
[sighs]

22:56.576 --> 23:00.413
I already have my wish.

23:00.447 --> 23:02.515
Right here.

23:02.549 --> 23:06.385
Being with you
and finally free.

23:06.419 --> 23:10.557
"Finally free."
I like that.

23:10.590 --> 23:11.991
That's a great song title.

23:12.024 --> 23:14.360
See?

23:14.393 --> 23:16.128
It's already working.

23:16.162 --> 23:17.864
You're inspiring me.

23:23.836 --> 23:26.639
I better go.

23:26.673 --> 23:28.808
It's getting late.

23:28.841 --> 23:31.377
When can I see you again?

23:31.410 --> 23:34.581
Tomorrow.

23:34.614 --> 23:37.617
And every tomorrow after that.

23:37.650 --> 23:40.853
I love you.

23:40.887 --> 23:43.723
I love you too.

24:04.477 --> 24:06.713
Late practice?

24:06.746 --> 24:09.516
We have a new coach.
She kept us.

24:09.549 --> 24:13.085
Listen, Emily, I understand
your probation officer

24:13.119 --> 24:14.587
has lifted your restrictions,

24:14.621 --> 24:17.690
but if you want to stay
on the National Team,

24:17.724 --> 24:18.758
we have certain conditions.

24:18.791 --> 24:21.460
So, you've decided then?

24:21.494 --> 24:22.562
I'm still on the team?

24:22.595 --> 24:24.430
Yes.

24:24.463 --> 24:26.733
Oh, thank God!

24:26.766 --> 24:29.001
Provided you
follow the rules

24:29.035 --> 24:30.970
laid out in this contract.

24:31.003 --> 24:32.705
Well, what kind of contract?

24:32.739 --> 24:34.473
It's more of a pledge

24:34.507 --> 24:37.176
to honor the conditions
of her team membership.

24:37.209 --> 24:39.512
What conditions?

24:39.546 --> 24:41.614
Basically you agree
not to work,

24:41.648 --> 24:43.616
to maintain an A grade average,

24:43.650 --> 24:45.518
and go nowhere but The Rock
and home.

24:45.552 --> 24:47.153
Of course, this means
no boyfriends,

24:47.186 --> 24:48.487
no social activities...

24:48.521 --> 24:50.156
No life.

24:50.189 --> 24:51.891
For how long?

24:51.924 --> 24:53.560
For as long as it takes

24:53.593 --> 24:55.494
for you to prove that
you can follow the rules.

24:55.528 --> 24:57.997
So, like, after Worlds?

24:58.030 --> 25:02.969
Whether or not
you're going to Worlds

25:03.002 --> 25:04.704
hasn't been decided.

25:06.205 --> 25:08.975
Look, I don't want you
to sign this now.

25:09.008 --> 25:10.577
I want you to
read it over carefully,

25:10.610 --> 25:12.679
think about it,
discuss it with your mom.

25:12.712 --> 25:15.548
It may seem like you
have no choice,

25:15.582 --> 25:20.820
but Emily, truly,
the choice is all yours.

25:28.761 --> 25:32.899
The Akash Mudra, we are
centering our energies...

25:32.932 --> 25:33.900
[deeply inhales]

25:33.933 --> 25:36.803
and nourishing our bodies.

25:40.206 --> 25:42.241
[whispering] This is ridiculous.

25:42.274 --> 25:45.511
I feel like I'm suffocating.

25:45.544 --> 25:46.713
You OK?

25:49.048 --> 25:52.819
[chanting] Ohm.

25:52.852 --> 25:55.888
An NGO rep came to my house
last night.

25:55.922 --> 25:58.758
- I'm still on the team.
- That's great!

25:58.791 --> 26:01.894
If I agree to sign
a contract promising

26:01.928 --> 26:03.796
to have
absolutely no life

26:03.830 --> 26:05.798
- outside of The Rock.
- Who cares?

26:05.832 --> 26:08.668
There is no life
outside of gymnastics,
not until 2012.

26:08.701 --> 26:10.036
You have to sign it.

26:10.069 --> 26:11.904
You just don't understand.

26:11.938 --> 26:13.172
Honestly, Emily?

26:13.205 --> 26:15.675
What I don't understand
is all the drama.

26:15.708 --> 26:17.610
Aren't they just asking you
to sign a piece of paper

26:17.644 --> 26:18.911
that says you'll
follow all the rules

26:18.945 --> 26:21.080
that most of us
follow anyway?

26:21.113 --> 26:22.615
[bell dings]

26:25.017 --> 26:27.654
And that ends
our morning meditation.

26:27.687 --> 26:30.690
Doesn't everyone
feel so energized?

26:31.357 --> 26:33.660
Ha! And now...

26:33.693 --> 26:38.698
Let the competition
for team captain begin!

26:38.731 --> 26:41.668
If we can even
call it that.
Let's face it,

26:41.701 --> 26:44.904
Payson is not the same gymnast
she once was.

26:44.937 --> 26:47.940
I'm really sorry if
that was harsh, Emily.

26:47.974 --> 26:49.909
You know I'm on your side.

26:51.778 --> 26:54.914
I know.

26:54.947 --> 26:58.617
And look... you've
gotta kill this.

26:58.651 --> 27:00.319
Trust me.

27:00.352 --> 27:02.655
I've never been more motivated
to win anything.

27:06.392 --> 27:10.362
So, we could rip out
all this recording equipment,

27:10.396 --> 27:13.599
and put in a big skylight
for natural light.

27:13.632 --> 27:15.001
You could paint in here,

27:15.034 --> 27:17.169
or we could get one
of those pottery wheels.

27:17.203 --> 27:20.372
Making ceramics is supposed
to be very soothing.

27:20.406 --> 27:22.208
Oh, my God.

27:22.241 --> 27:25.745
Look at how young I was.

27:25.778 --> 27:28.314
I had the whole world
by the tail.

27:28.347 --> 27:30.316
And no one kept you from
doing what you loved.

27:32.084 --> 27:34.386
Well, it's time I, uh...

27:34.420 --> 27:37.023
I put all this stuff
in storage anyway.

27:37.056 --> 27:38.758
I'm gonna get some boxes.

27:43.429 --> 27:46.365
Dad, you can't let her
do this to me.

27:46.398 --> 27:48.735
She gave up on her dream,
and she wants me
to give up on mine.

27:48.768 --> 27:51.370
That's not true, Kaylie.
She's worried about your health.

27:51.403 --> 27:53.672
We both are. When you
collapsed at the World Trials,

27:53.706 --> 27:55.041
you scared us half to death.

27:55.074 --> 27:57.243
I was overtraining,
and not eating enough.

27:57.276 --> 28:00.713
I get it. But it won't ever
happen again. I'm fine.

28:00.747 --> 28:02.414
That's not what you
told the therapist.

28:02.448 --> 28:04.650
You admitted you had a problem
and recovery takes time.

28:04.683 --> 28:06.352
I don't have time!

28:06.385 --> 28:09.055
Please. You are the only one
that can help me.

28:09.088 --> 28:10.757
I am helping you, Kaylie.

28:10.790 --> 28:13.059
- I'm helping you get well.
- I am well!

28:17.964 --> 28:20.266
I'm sorry.

28:30.709 --> 28:33.045
[Darby] Any time
you're ready, Payson.

29:09.248 --> 29:10.316
[cheering]

29:11.417 --> 29:12.852
Yes, Payson!

29:12.885 --> 29:15.754
And here I thought
you were rooting for me.

29:18.057 --> 29:21.127
Ho-hum. And now for
some power moves.

29:21.160 --> 29:22.795
Watch this and weep.

29:36.876 --> 29:39.411
* I want to tell you there's
a really good reason *

29:39.445 --> 29:43.515
* Why I came home wasted
in the middle of the night *

29:43.549 --> 29:46.385
That sloppy landing cost her.
You can beat her on bars.

29:46.418 --> 29:49.221
- Yeah, but not on beam.
- You don't have to.

29:49.255 --> 29:51.490
She's pulling out her biggest
moves to show off for Darby.

29:51.523 --> 29:53.159
She'll make a mistake.

29:56.462 --> 29:59.531
* You can watch it
when you get a bit older *

29:59.565 --> 30:03.802
* But for now in the bad bits,
I should cover your eyes *

30:03.836 --> 30:06.805
* She painted pictures
with the tips of her fingers *

30:06.839 --> 30:11.077
* Sewing buttons to Bambi,
tying strings to a kite *

30:11.110 --> 30:15.514
* Turning into
black and white *

30:15.547 --> 30:18.484
You were saying?

30:18.517 --> 30:19.551
That was perfect!

30:22.488 --> 30:24.490
I'm going to do
the Shaposhnikova.

30:24.523 --> 30:27.493
You haven't done that
since you broke your back.

30:27.526 --> 30:28.527
Do you still have it?

30:28.560 --> 30:31.497
We're about to see.

30:37.403 --> 30:41.040
* I want to tell you there's
a really good reason *

30:41.073 --> 30:45.411
* Why I came down easy spinning
threads to the throne *

30:45.444 --> 30:47.479
* That tiny kingdom
at the bottom of the trees *

30:47.513 --> 30:49.381
* Where I was always a winner

30:49.415 --> 30:51.817
* And I was barely alone

30:51.850 --> 30:56.055
* Turning into
black and white *

30:56.088 --> 30:57.623
Here it comes.

30:59.858 --> 31:04.296
* But I still got my stripes

31:04.330 --> 31:06.933
- [cheering delightedly]
- [giggling] Wow!

31:06.966 --> 31:09.501
Don't you just love the smell
of competition in the morning?

31:09.535 --> 31:14.540
Not bad, but let's face it,
I am "Queen of the Beam,"

31:14.573 --> 31:17.309
so no one will blame you
if you want to concede now.

31:17.343 --> 31:19.411
Emily, did I ever mention

31:19.445 --> 31:21.513
my new double Arabian
dismount on beam?

31:21.547 --> 31:23.615
Bull.
That's a power move.

31:23.649 --> 31:26.285
Sasha thought I needed
a secret weapon,

31:26.318 --> 31:28.420
and I did just do
the Shaposhnikova.

31:28.454 --> 31:31.590
Hey. Get me a spring board.

31:31.623 --> 31:34.593
I'm gonna do a round-off,
tuck-full mount.

31:37.496 --> 31:40.332
That's a dangerous move.
Are you sure you've got it?

31:40.366 --> 31:42.001
I've got this.

31:42.034 --> 31:45.471
Do you really have
the double Arabian?

31:45.504 --> 31:47.073
No.

31:47.106 --> 31:50.542
But I knew she'd try something
reckless if she thought I did.

31:53.946 --> 31:55.414
I can't believe
I'm saying this,

31:55.447 --> 32:00.152
but, you don't want her
to hurt herself, do you?

32:05.591 --> 32:09.028
Look, I lied.

32:09.061 --> 32:10.496
I don't have
the double Arabian.

32:10.529 --> 32:12.031
So, you don't have to do this.

32:12.064 --> 32:13.932
Scared I might just
nail it?

32:13.966 --> 32:16.502
Don't worry.
I'm a big girl.

32:22.241 --> 32:23.542
You are not gonna
let her do this.

32:23.575 --> 32:25.144
How could I stop her?

32:25.177 --> 32:28.547
You're her coach.
Just tell her no.

32:28.580 --> 32:32.985
Look, if she says she can
do it, it's my then it's
my job to support her.

32:41.160 --> 32:45.031
Well... Our coach
isn't gonna stop her,

32:45.064 --> 32:47.699
and your mom and
Summer aren't here.

32:48.600 --> 32:50.236
I'm ready.

32:50.269 --> 32:53.205
Fine, I concede. You win.

32:53.239 --> 32:55.141
You can be the team captain.

32:55.174 --> 32:58.577
I don't accept.
I will win this fair and square.

32:58.610 --> 33:00.979
So, if you don't mind,

33:01.013 --> 33:02.548
I'm about to blow you away.

33:13.392 --> 33:15.527
* Your love is tangled in me

33:15.561 --> 33:18.597
* Wrapped up in our misery

33:18.630 --> 33:20.299
I knew she could do it.

33:20.332 --> 33:23.602
* What we call good memories

33:23.635 --> 33:25.971
* Your eyes deceive

33:26.004 --> 33:27.606
* You see what you
want to see *

33:27.639 --> 33:31.277
* But you don't see me

33:31.310 --> 33:33.745
* So

33:33.779 --> 33:35.414
* Head out alone

33:35.447 --> 33:37.683
* I'll be just
fine, fine, fine *

33:37.716 --> 33:40.219
* Make a life of your own

33:40.252 --> 33:44.090
* See the world
through changed eyes *

33:44.123 --> 33:45.524
* You're always keeping me
Keep keeping me *

33:45.557 --> 33:48.160
* Down, down, down

33:49.661 --> 33:51.330
* Why you keeping me around

33:51.363 --> 33:53.732
I'm fine.

33:53.765 --> 33:55.701
I told you she'd
make a mistake.

33:55.734 --> 33:58.604
All you have to do now is
a simple flawless routine,

33:58.637 --> 34:01.373
and you've got this.

34:01.407 --> 34:04.476
* Like a puppet in
your one-man show *

34:04.510 --> 34:06.345
* You either unaware

34:06.378 --> 34:09.215
* Or you just don't care

34:09.248 --> 34:10.649
* Head out alone

34:10.682 --> 34:14.353
* I'll be just
fine, fine, fine *

34:14.386 --> 34:16.021
* Make a life of your own

34:16.054 --> 34:19.625
* See the world
through changed eyes *

34:19.658 --> 34:21.527
* You're always keeping me
Keep keeping me *

34:21.560 --> 34:24.496
* Down, down, down

34:24.530 --> 34:26.565
* Why you keeping me
Why you keeping me *

34:26.598 --> 34:29.401
* Around

34:29.435 --> 34:34.706
* You said you loved me
but you lied *

34:34.740 --> 34:39.044
* There were strings attached
You had me tied *

34:39.077 --> 34:45.317
* You said you loved me
but you lied *

34:45.351 --> 34:50.289
* That's OK 'cause so did I *

34:52.824 --> 34:54.460
You did it!

34:54.493 --> 34:56.828
Did what? A perfectly
boring routine?

34:56.862 --> 34:58.530
She hasn't won anything yet.

35:04.670 --> 35:07.573
Wasn't that a nail biter?

35:07.606 --> 35:12.411
Let's hear it for our
fierce women warriors!

35:14.813 --> 35:17.683
As far as I'm concerned,
you're both winners

35:17.716 --> 35:20.619
and apparently,
the judges agree.

35:20.652 --> 35:22.521
- We have a tie!
- [both] A tie?

35:22.554 --> 35:25.457
Which I guess leaves me
to decide after all.

35:25.491 --> 35:27.593
Yes!

35:27.626 --> 35:31.597
But you know,
this brings to mind

35:31.630 --> 35:34.533
a tidbit from the ancient
Olympic games.

35:34.566 --> 35:37.303
When the Persian
military officer Tigranes

35:37.336 --> 35:40.572
heard that the prize was not
money but a crown of olive,

35:40.606 --> 35:43.141
he could not hold
his peace, but cried,

35:43.175 --> 35:45.411
"Good heavens, Mardonius,

35:45.444 --> 35:48.480
what kind of men
are these that you
have pitted us against?

35:48.514 --> 35:50.649
For it is not money
that they contend,

35:50.682 --> 35:53.151
but for the glory
of achievement!"

35:53.185 --> 35:55.821
And that is what
we have seen here today,

35:55.854 --> 35:58.724
the glory of achievement.

35:58.757 --> 36:02.594
So, why spoil it by
choosing a winner or a loser?

36:02.628 --> 36:06.465
Therefore, I have decided
that your new team co-captains

36:06.498 --> 36:08.634
are Payson Keeler
and Lauren Tanner!

36:08.667 --> 36:10.302
Yay!

36:11.537 --> 36:13.772
Payson, Lauren,
congratulations!

36:13.805 --> 36:17.175
This blows! Oh!

36:20.946 --> 36:23.349
Oh, my God,
I wish I'd been there!

36:23.382 --> 36:25.217
Any idea when they're gonna
let you come back to The Rock?

36:25.251 --> 36:26.918
[sighs] No.

36:26.952 --> 36:29.187
They don't think
I can handle training

36:29.221 --> 36:31.823
without starving myself.

36:31.857 --> 36:33.625
Can you?

36:33.659 --> 36:36.895
Look, I got a little obsessed
with beating Gengji Cho,

36:36.928 --> 36:38.697
so I tried to
get my weight down.

36:38.730 --> 36:40.732
It was stupid,
but I'm fine now,

36:40.766 --> 36:43.168
and nobody seems to care
that I might miss Worlds.

36:43.201 --> 36:44.503
You and me both.

36:44.536 --> 36:46.472
Well, at least you're still
on the National Team.

36:46.505 --> 36:49.575
If I sign my life over
to the NGO.

36:49.608 --> 36:51.543
And give up Damon.

36:51.577 --> 36:53.512
Payson doesn't understand.

36:53.545 --> 36:54.780
Won't he wait?

36:54.813 --> 36:56.848
How long is he supposed
to wait around,

36:56.882 --> 36:58.517
giving me everything I need

36:58.550 --> 37:00.286
without ever
getting anything back?

37:00.319 --> 37:03.188
I mean, we haven't even,
you know, had sex.

37:03.221 --> 37:04.490
I haven't even
given him that.

37:04.523 --> 37:07.526
Well, that's
a big decision, Em.

37:07.559 --> 37:10.362
I love Damon.

37:10.396 --> 37:12.298
He's my soulmate, and...

37:12.331 --> 37:15.233
I want to be with him
in every way.

37:15.267 --> 37:17.235
Well, isn't he in LA anyway?

37:17.269 --> 37:20.238
No, he's back in Boulder.

37:20.272 --> 37:23.542
Damon doesn't even know
if he can finish his record.

37:23.575 --> 37:27.513
He spent most of his advance
on recording studios in LA.

37:27.546 --> 37:29.515
How am I supposed to
tell him I can't help him?

37:29.548 --> 37:31.517
Maybe you can.

37:31.550 --> 37:33.852
Does he need a recording
studio here?

37:33.885 --> 37:35.387
Well, if he can afford one.

37:35.421 --> 37:38.023
How about one that's free?

37:40.759 --> 37:44.430
You need to tell Darby to
make me team captain alone!

37:44.463 --> 37:47.232
What's wrong with being
co-captain with Payson?

37:47.265 --> 37:49.635
Everything.
It's my turn to be captain,

37:49.668 --> 37:51.437
and Darby was supposed
to be my coach.

37:51.470 --> 37:54.340
Hold on.
I brought Darby here
for all the girls,

37:54.373 --> 37:57.309
and I'm not telling her
to play favorites with you.

37:57.343 --> 37:58.810
Oh, yes, you are.

37:58.844 --> 38:01.647
Because if you don't finally
do something for me,

38:01.680 --> 38:03.615
I will tell the whole world
what I did.

38:06.952 --> 38:09.621
What did you do?

38:09.655 --> 38:12.791
What you couldn't.
I got rid of Sasha.

38:12.824 --> 38:15.894
I took the training cam footage
of Payson kissing him,

38:15.927 --> 38:17.663
and I sent it
to Ellen Beals.

38:17.696 --> 38:19.765
And that is the only reason
that Summer came back to you,

38:19.798 --> 38:21.500
and the only reason
you got elected president.

38:21.533 --> 38:23.369
Because of me!

38:23.402 --> 38:25.937
You owe me everything
and I owe you nothing,

38:25.971 --> 38:29.608
because you robbed me of
the only thing I ever wanted.

38:29.641 --> 38:31.710
My mother.

38:32.711 --> 38:34.613
So, the next time I ask you

38:34.646 --> 38:36.682
to do something for
your own daughter,

38:36.715 --> 38:38.917
you'll do it!

38:53.599 --> 38:55.901
[whistles]

38:55.934 --> 38:57.536
Wow.

38:57.569 --> 38:58.937
This is amazing.

38:58.970 --> 39:00.872
I can't believe
no one's using it.

39:00.906 --> 39:04.810
My mom finally gave up
on her recording career
a few years ago.

39:04.843 --> 39:06.412
Her passion for music

39:06.445 --> 39:08.346
was replaced with her passion
for shopping.

39:08.380 --> 39:10.816
And you're sure she doesn't mind
me recording here?

39:10.849 --> 39:12.884
Are you kidding,
she's thrilled.

39:12.918 --> 39:14.820
The idea of turning
her shrine to herself

39:14.853 --> 39:16.855
into an art studio for me
was killing her.

39:16.888 --> 39:18.757
So, you're into art?

39:18.790 --> 39:20.091
[scoffs] No.

39:20.125 --> 39:24.396
But part of my therapy
is having to explore

39:24.430 --> 39:26.998
different interests
besides gymnastics.

39:27.032 --> 39:29.435
So, I actually
have to pretend

39:29.468 --> 39:32.638
like I'm sort of serious
about this whole hobby thing,

39:32.671 --> 39:36.575
so, I hope it's OK,
but I told my mother

39:36.608 --> 39:40.345
I might do some singing...
with you.

39:40.378 --> 39:41.847
I didn't know
you were a singer.

39:41.880 --> 39:43.982
Oh, I'm not.

39:44.015 --> 39:46.084
But, if I just hang out
sometimes when you're here,

39:46.117 --> 39:47.553
she'll never know
the difference.

39:47.586 --> 39:49.421
And I promise,
I will not bother you.

39:49.455 --> 39:51.590
No worries, you...

39:51.623 --> 39:53.759
...you're saving my life.

39:53.792 --> 39:55.827
And you're saving me from
having to make ceramic ashtrays.

39:55.861 --> 39:59.731
Thank you, Kaylie.

39:59.765 --> 40:02.768
No, thank Emily.
You've given her so much,

40:02.801 --> 40:05.871
she just really wanted to
give you something back.

40:05.904 --> 40:06.905
[Maeve] So, is he hot?

40:06.938 --> 40:09.475
- I don't know.
- Of course you know.

40:09.508 --> 40:11.677
Damon is Emily's boyfriend.

40:11.710 --> 40:13.879
I thought you said she wasn't
allowed to have a boyfriend.

40:13.912 --> 40:17.415
It doesn't matter, I would
never do that to a friend.

40:17.449 --> 40:19.751
That doesn't mean you can't
make beautiful music together.

40:19.785 --> 40:23.989
I am not a singer,
I'm a gymnast.

40:24.022 --> 40:26.057
And I'm just trying to keep
my mom off my back.

40:26.091 --> 40:28.860
Well, it could be worse.
Maybe you can't train,

40:28.894 --> 40:30.829
but at least you get
to see a cute guy

40:30.862 --> 40:32.998
over at your house
every day.

40:33.031 --> 40:35.634
Hey, any idea when they're
letting you out?

40:35.667 --> 40:37.769
Hopefully soon.

40:37.803 --> 40:40.806
It's a little harder
for repeat offenders.

40:40.839 --> 40:42.474
[woman] Lights out,
5 minutes.

40:42.508 --> 40:45.611
[sighs] Gotta go.

40:45.644 --> 40:47.913
'Kay. Sweet rehab dreams.

40:50.749 --> 40:53.451
[doorbell ringing]

40:58.056 --> 40:59.891
Emily? What are you...

40:59.925 --> 41:01.159
What are you doing here?

41:01.192 --> 41:04.763
If I told you...

41:04.796 --> 41:06.865
...that I was gonna
give up gymnastics

41:06.898 --> 41:07.966
to be with you
all the time...

41:07.999 --> 41:11.837
Go on tour with you,
and support you

41:11.870 --> 41:15.006
and inspire you every
minute of every day...

41:15.040 --> 41:17.609
And that I was sure
that's what I wanted,

41:17.643 --> 41:19.745
more than anything in the world,

41:19.778 --> 41:21.446
what would you say?

41:21.479 --> 41:25.717
I'd say you were
making a big mistake.

41:25.751 --> 41:29.020
That's what I
thought you'd say.

41:29.054 --> 41:31.022
Don't stand here,
come in.

41:35.794 --> 41:38.163
Em, what's the matter?

41:38.196 --> 41:41.767
If I want to stay on
the National Team...

41:44.102 --> 41:45.771
I have to sign a contract

41:45.804 --> 41:47.138
saying that I
won't have a boyfriend,

41:47.172 --> 41:49.808
or see anyone
outside of The Rock.

41:49.841 --> 41:54.245
That I'll just train
and come home,

41:54.279 --> 41:56.782
for as long
as they see fit.

41:59.184 --> 42:00.752
[whispering] Oh, my God.

42:00.786 --> 42:03.755
I hope you signed it.

42:14.600 --> 42:16.067
I'm so sorry.

42:16.101 --> 42:19.805
I want to be here for you.

42:19.838 --> 42:22.140
But I'm just not ready
to give up yet.

42:22.173 --> 42:24.075
And I don't want you to.

42:24.109 --> 42:26.845
I told you that I would wait

42:26.878 --> 42:29.615
until after the Olympics
if that's what it takes.

42:29.648 --> 42:30.916
And nothing's changed.

42:45.563 --> 42:48.199
One thing has changed.

42:50.802 --> 42:53.805
I don't want to wait
to be with you.

42:53.839 --> 42:59.077
That is one thing that
I can give you right now.

42:59.110 --> 43:01.847
Before I turn in
that contract.

43:09.655 --> 43:12.624
Are you sure?

43:14.292 --> 43:16.828
I love you.

43:16.862 --> 43:18.830
And I don't want to wonder

43:18.864 --> 43:21.332
what it's like to be with you
for another second.
