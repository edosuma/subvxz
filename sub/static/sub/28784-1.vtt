08:46.610 --> 08:49.050
So, what you want to do is get
this full coverage,

08:49.220 --> 08:50.830
and that way,
it'’ll cover everything,

08:51.010 --> 08:53.620
and you can just walk away.

08:53.790 --> 08:55.620
Just walk away, huh?

08:59.750 --> 09:02.630
[phone chirps]

09:06.410 --> 09:08.590
[whooshing]

09:08.720 --> 09:10.200
[yells]

09:10.370 --> 09:12.510
[groans]

09:12.680 --> 09:14.550
What state is the car in now?

09:14.720 --> 09:17.510
Well, the car won'’t go
in reverse... or drive,

09:17.640 --> 09:19.950
but the airbag works very well.

09:20.080 --> 09:22.040
Okay. How are you doing now?

09:22.210 --> 09:24.730
Um, listen, I'’m fine,
but I'’m in a big rush, okay?

09:24.870 --> 09:26.480
I just walked away,
like you said.

09:26.650 --> 09:28.390
Well, I did say that, but...

09:28.520 --> 09:30.700
All right, Regina, I'’m... I'm ina rush. Thank you so much.

09:30.870 --> 09:32.830
-Hello?
-KEN: Hi.

09:33.000 --> 09:35.480
My name is Susan.
I'’m very happy to be here.

09:35.660 --> 09:37.700
-[purring]
-What is your name?

09:37.880 --> 09:38.880
-I'’m Ronald Reagan.
-[Ken gasps]

09:39.050 --> 09:40.530
-Just call me "Ronnie."
-Oh.

09:40.660 --> 09:43.490
Oh, I love your face.
It'’s so unusual.

09:43.670 --> 09:45.100
I'’m from Colorado,

09:45.280 --> 09:48.760
and I'’ve never lived
with another cat before.

09:48.890 --> 09:52.550
Well, you'’ll be fine here
because my mom loves cats.

09:52.680 --> 09:55.720
-Doesn'’t she?
I'’m gonna get... Oh!
-[door opens]

09:55.900 --> 09:57.030
-Oh!
-Hey, Mom.
-Chip!

09:57.200 --> 09:59.250
I need to borrow a car.
Do you have the keys?

09:59.420 --> 10:01.250
-What? My car keys?
-Yeah.

10:01.420 --> 10:02.860
[yowling]
-[mutters] Cat!

10:03.030 --> 10:04.770
What happened to your face?

10:04.950 --> 10:06.690
No, I-I'’m fine, Mom.
Hi, Ken. How are you?

10:06.860 --> 10:07.910
-Hey, Chip.
-Welcome to town.

10:08.080 --> 10:09.470
-Hey, glad to be here.
-Nice to see you.

10:09.650 --> 10:10.560
-Mm-hmm.
-What kind of shenanigans...?

10:10.690 --> 10:12.480
Hey, Ken,
do you have a...? Uh...

10:12.650 --> 10:13.700
[quietly]: He'’s always doing
these kind of things.

10:13.870 --> 10:15.090
Hey, Ken, do you have car
I can borrow?

10:15.260 --> 10:17.440
I don'’t think he's fit to drive.

10:17.570 --> 10:20.750
It'’s always something with him--money, car, keys.

10:20.920 --> 10:23.790
Mom, a friend is relying on me.Can I borrow your car?

10:23.970 --> 10:25.580
-No.
-Why?

10:25.710 --> 10:28.060
Well, at least let me put
some Mercurochrome on this.

10:28.230 --> 10:29.710
-CHIP: What?
-Or a salve.

10:29.890 --> 10:31.710
-I don'’t want your salves
on my face.
-Oh...

10:31.890 --> 10:34.590
Well, you'’re gonna get
an infection, and then what?

10:34.760 --> 10:37.460
-He-he does have obligations.
-What?

10:37.590 --> 10:40.160
Well, why don'’t you take him
then, Ken? Ken will take you.

10:40.330 --> 10:42.030
I can do it myself, Mom.
It'’s fine. I can...

10:42.160 --> 10:45.160
Go ahead, Ken.
Welcome to the family.

10:45.340 --> 10:46.900
I'’ll take care of the cats.

10:47.080 --> 10:48.910
[whispering]:
I don'’t have gas money.

10:50.860 --> 10:52.080
[sighs]

10:52.260 --> 10:53.820
[door closes]

10:54.000 --> 10:55.130
-[cat yowling]
-Ronald?

10:59.740 --> 11:00.960
KEN:
I didn'’t know

11:01.140 --> 11:02.480
we was going this far.

11:02.620 --> 11:03.620
Might have to get some gas.

11:03.790 --> 11:04.880
I should'’ve driven.

11:05.050 --> 11:06.490
It'’s just to help out a friend.

11:06.620 --> 11:09.710
Well, is this a friend
or a "friend"?

11:09.840 --> 11:11.710
I don'’t really know.

11:13.500 --> 11:15.370
Friend. Yeah, friend.

11:15.540 --> 11:16.930
Have you thought about
what color

11:17.110 --> 11:18.850
you want to paint your room?

11:18.980 --> 11:21.590
I like plaid,or is that more of an attitude?

11:21.760 --> 11:24.200
Yeah, that could be
a little tricky.

11:24.380 --> 11:27.290
You know, sometimes you put
a color like that on the wall,

11:27.420 --> 11:30.430
and you step back and look at itand go, "Wow, that'’s no good."

11:30.600 --> 11:31.770
Or sometimes you love it,

11:31.950 --> 11:34.560
and two years later,
it'’s out of style.

11:34.730 --> 11:37.430
How long are you planning
on staying with us, Chip?

11:37.610 --> 11:40.830
Uh, I don'’t know.
I guess until I die?

11:42.390 --> 11:43.960
Oh, God.

11:44.130 --> 11:46.010
-[loud thudding, glass breaking]-Huh?

11:46.180 --> 11:48.230
[both cats yowling]

11:48.400 --> 11:49.880
Ronnie?

11:50.050 --> 11:51.710
-[loud yowling]
-Stop it, you two!

11:51.880 --> 11:53.670
-What are you do...? Oh!

11:53.800 --> 11:55.670

11:57.930 --> 11:59.580
-Susan.
-[yowls]

11:59.760 --> 12:00.760
Ow!

12:00.930 --> 12:03.370
-Bad kitty.

12:03.550 --> 12:05.680
CHIP:
There-there she is.

12:05.810 --> 12:07.900
Penelope!

12:08.070 --> 12:10.860
Oh... Chip.

12:11.030 --> 12:14.380
-How are you?
-How are you?

12:14.560 --> 12:17.170
-Nice to see you.
-Oh, so nice to see you, too.

12:17.340 --> 12:18.950
-Have you been well?
-Oh, it'’s...
-[siren toots]

12:19.130 --> 12:20.560
OFFICER [over speaker]:  Colorado plates, move it along.

12:20.690 --> 12:21.960
-KEN: Come on, you two!
-Oh.

12:22.130 --> 12:23.480
-Let me help you
with this stuff.
-Who is this?

12:23.650 --> 12:24.700
Oh, that'’s, uh,
my mom'’s boyfriend.

12:24.830 --> 12:26.660
Your... your mom'’s boyfriend?

12:26.830 --> 12:27.920
-Yeah, that'’s... that's Ken.
-Oh.

12:28.050 --> 12:29.750
He'’s having sex with my mom.

12:29.920 --> 12:32.400
[horns honking]

12:32.570 --> 12:34.180
Wow, Hollywood.
Look-- Madame Tussauds.

12:34.360 --> 12:35.710
CHIP:
Yeah.

12:35.880 --> 12:38.010
So, you know, uh,
Chip and I were married

12:38.190 --> 12:41.710
before his mother sent me away?

12:41.890 --> 12:44.630
No, Chip never told me
you guys were married.

12:44.800 --> 12:46.940
-Yeah.
-You never told him?

12:47.110 --> 12:48.370
Uh...

12:48.500 --> 12:49.940
And Christine sent you away?

12:50.070 --> 12:52.900
-She did, yes.
-[scoffs]

12:53.070 --> 12:55.680
Because we had an arrangement,
you know?

12:55.860 --> 12:57.730
I needed a green card,

12:57.900 --> 12:59.730
uh, Chip needed someone to love.

12:59.910 --> 13:01.430
But, uh, Christine didn'’t think

13:01.600 --> 13:03.650
it was a good idea, so...

13:03.820 --> 13:05.870
she called my father, and...

13:06.040 --> 13:08.520
-Hmm. Oh, I see.
-Yeah.

13:08.700 --> 13:11.000
I'’m sorry.

13:11.180 --> 13:13.010
Mm, yes.

13:13.180 --> 13:15.010
[Ken sighs]

13:15.180 --> 13:17.100
Is she still
destroying your life?

13:17.270 --> 13:19.270
CHIP:
Uh...

13:19.450 --> 13:21.280
she-she'’s got...

13:21.450 --> 13:23.410
She'’s better.
Bit better.

13:23.540 --> 13:26.670
That'’s a "yes."
[laughs]

13:26.850 --> 13:29.330
Hey, Ken,
so you moved to Bakerfield

13:29.500 --> 13:31.420
to marry a Basket just like me.

13:31.550 --> 13:32.940
[both chuckle]

13:33.110 --> 13:34.290
Mm-hmm.

13:34.460 --> 13:36.460
I hope you'’re more luckier
than me, though.

13:36.640 --> 13:38.730
[laughs]
Yeah, well, I hope so.

13:38.900 --> 13:40.290
-[Penelope laughs]
-Yeah.

13:40.470 --> 13:42.950
It was good, though, really.
It was good in the end.

13:43.120 --> 13:44.950
After all,
I went back to France,

13:45.130 --> 13:47.650
and I dealt
with my father, and...

13:47.780 --> 13:48.820
-It'’s, uh, different status...
-[phone ringing]

13:49.000 --> 13:50.350
Ho-Hold on.
Ho-Hold on, Penelope.

13:50.520 --> 13:51.740
Let me take this call.

13:51.910 --> 13:53.960
Hey, Chrissy.

13:54.130 --> 13:55.880
Hey, the cats got
in a big fight.

13:56.050 --> 13:57.570
I just wanted to let you know.

13:57.750 --> 13:59.230
Oh, no. Is Susan okay?

13:59.360 --> 14:01.320
Yeah, I... I think she is.

14:01.490 --> 14:03.450
-Chip?
-Yes.

14:03.580 --> 14:05.800
Did you decide
on the paint for your room?

14:05.930 --> 14:08.890
Is it gonna be Bluebird Breeze or Blue Boy Balloon?

14:09.060 --> 14:10.890
Oh, I was...

14:11.060 --> 14:12.810
Hello, Mama Baskets!

14:12.980 --> 14:15.760
[sing-songy]:
It'’s me, Penelope.

14:19.290 --> 14:22.380
Ken... take me off speaker.

14:22.550 --> 14:24.380
Okay, sweetie.
Talk to you later.

14:24.560 --> 14:25.910
-Bye.
-[phone beeps]

14:26.040 --> 14:27.950
God.

14:28.120 --> 14:30.260
Didn'’t you say she got better?

14:30.390 --> 14:31.780
She just doesn'’t... She...

14:31.950 --> 14:33.960
She doesn'’t like
to be on speakerphone.

14:34.130 --> 14:36.700
[pop song playing]

14:43.490 --> 14:45.010
-Hey, staying with us? Okay.
-Uh, she is.

14:45.190 --> 14:47.270
-Yeah, let me take that. No.
-Oh, I got it.

14:47.400 --> 14:48.840
You know, it'’s what we do.
I can just...

14:49.020 --> 14:50.100
I can just take it.
No. Can I help you take that?

14:50.280 --> 14:52.110
I was just gonna...
just take it up to her room...

14:52.280 --> 14:54.190
Whoa, careful, careful.
Aah! My finger. Ow.

14:54.370 --> 14:56.280
-Thanks. I'’ll get this.
-Oh, yeah.

14:56.410 --> 14:58.110
Uh, she flew in?

14:58.290 --> 14:59.590
Yeah, she had a long flight.

14:59.760 --> 15:01.940
Hey, Uber guy, can you pull outof here, please?

15:02.120 --> 15:04.070
He'’s, uh...

15:04.200 --> 15:06.030
He'’s, uh, my, uh... He's my...

15:06.210 --> 15:08.510
Hey, do you want me
to call you stepdad or dad?

15:08.640 --> 15:10.340
-How do...?
-No, call me "Dad."

15:10.510 --> 15:12.340
-Yeah, that'’s my dad.
-Oh. So, I'’m sorry about that.

15:12.520 --> 15:14.430
-Thank you.-Oh, yeah, I'’ll-I'll take that.

15:14.610 --> 15:16.300

15:16.430 --> 15:18.610
Well...

15:18.780 --> 15:20.960
thank you so much.

15:21.130 --> 15:24.220

-Penelope?
-Yeah?

15:36.240 --> 15:40.410
Did you want to maybe, uh,
grab a bite to eat tonight?

15:40.590 --> 15:42.240
Um...

15:42.420 --> 15:43.940
Remember that place in Paris
we used to go to go?

15:44.110 --> 15:46.250
-that looked like a...
-No. I'’m sorry. I'm so tired.

15:46.420 --> 15:48.120
I just had a long flight,
you know?

15:48.250 --> 15:50.120
It'’s just
that I'’m in Los Angeles,

15:50.250 --> 15:51.990
and it'’s kind of neat for me.

15:52.120 --> 15:53.170
I'’m stuck in Bakersfield.

15:53.340 --> 15:54.910
I thought maybe...

15:55.080 --> 15:56.340
Ah, right.

15:56.470 --> 15:58.350
You'’re stuck with your mother.

15:58.480 --> 16:00.350
You need to get away,

16:00.480 --> 16:02.440
I think, hmm?

16:03.610 --> 16:05.570
MAN:
Penelope?

16:05.700 --> 16:07.480

16:44.300 --> 16:46.220
and Ronnie-- I don'’t know wherehe ran, but...

16:46.390 --> 16:49.480
They'’re just not connecting yet.It'’s gonna take time.

16:49.660 --> 16:51.660
Oh, poor Susan.
She must be so scared.

16:51.830 --> 16:53.440
CHRISTINE:
Well, Ronnie'’s scared.

16:53.620 --> 16:56.140
-Chip, how are you?
-I'’m fine, Mom, thank you.

16:56.320 --> 16:58.190
You know what?
She knows my scent.

16:58.360 --> 17:00.190
I think I'’ll go sleepin the gift wrap room with her,

17:00.360 --> 17:02.240
-keep her company.
-MRS. BASKETS: Ken...

17:02.410 --> 17:04.410

-Now I'’m gonna be all alone.

17:06.849 --> 17:08.150
[clicks her tongue]

17:08.329 --> 17:09.940
Where are you gonna sleep,
honey?

17:11.680 --> 17:13.680
Uh, just...
This is... this is good.

17:13.859 --> 17:15.730
We made some of our
most popular video logs...

17:15.900 --> 17:19.030
-I'’m tired.
-Yeah.

17:19.210 --> 17:22.339

You know,

17:38.180 --> 17:43.020
I'’m kind of used to talking  to you on the screen like this.

17:43.190 --> 17:44.540
I just wanted to say

17:44.710 --> 17:47.800
I know how hard it must be
for you and Susan.

I'’m a cat person, you know, so,

I really realize
what you'’re going through.

I want you to know

17:58.330 --> 18:01.470

very happy to be here.

that I had a talk

18:05.170 --> 18:08.040
with Ronald Reagan,
and he'’s over it.

18:08.210 --> 18:12.170
And he'’s gonna allow
a Democratic cat in the house.

18:12.350 --> 18:14.090

18:14.260 --> 18:16.570

as a Democrat?

with this move, too.

18:42.770 --> 18:45.210

when I'’m packing.
