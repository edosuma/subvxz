02:19.623 --> 02:21.511
- Excuse me.
- Easy!

02:21.592 --> 02:23.481
Excuse me!

02:24.561 --> 02:28.258
- Sorry.
- Easy!

02:40.244 --> 02:42.804
Good morning. Jackson-Steinem.

02:42.880 --> 02:45.041
- How you doing, Buddy?
- Great, Carolyn.

02:45.115 --> 02:48.175
Doing any better, it'd be a sin.

02:50.120 --> 02:52.111
Good morning.

02:59.463 --> 03:01.886
Good morning, Dan.
What's lookin' good today?

03:01.965 --> 03:03.887
If I knew, I wouldn't be in this business.

03:03.967 --> 03:05.889
Get out while you're young, kid.

03:05.969 --> 03:09.268
I came here one day,
I sat down, and look at me now.

03:09.339 --> 03:11.330
Look at you now.

03:13.744 --> 03:17.407
Good morning, Brian.
Hey, Chuckie. How's the woman slayer?

03:17.481 --> 03:20.109
Still looking for the right 18-year-old wife.
How you doing, pal?

03:20.184 --> 03:22.311
Well, uh, if I had your looks, better.

03:22.386 --> 03:25.878
Takes years of genetics, a Yale education, 
and the right tailor.

03:25.956 --> 03:28.845
Not that you learned anything, chump.

03:29.993 --> 03:31.585
- Marv.
- Hey.

03:31.662 --> 03:34.085
Marv, I got a feeling
we are gonna make a killing today.

03:34.164 --> 03:36.086
Oh, yeah?
Where's your machine gun?

03:36.166 --> 03:38.396
Jesus, you can't make a buck in this market.

03:38.469 --> 03:42.496
The country's going to hell faster than when
that son of a bitch Roosevelt was in charge.

03:42.573 --> 03:45.872
Too much cheap money sloshin' around 
in the world.

03:45.943 --> 03:49.834
Worst mistake we ever made 
was letting Nixon get off the gold standard.

03:49.913 --> 03:52.438
Putney Drug.
You boys might wanna take a look at it.

03:52.516 --> 03:54.711
No. Take five years
for that company to come around.

03:54.785 --> 03:58.482
But they got a good new drug.
Stick to the fundamentals.

03:58.555 --> 04:00.944
That's how I.B.M. and Hilton were built.

04:01.024 --> 04:04.187
Good things sometimes take time.

04:04.261 --> 04:06.752
<i>Look sharp today, boys, 
especially you rookies.</i>

04:06.830 --> 04:08.752
<i>The Nikkei index closed up 
90 points last night.</i>

04:08.832 --> 04:11.164
<i>We expect heavy Japanese buying 
on the opening.</i>

04:11.235 --> 04:16.399
<i>The firm has 200,000 steel for sale.
350,000 pork and beans.</i>

04:16.473 --> 04:19.464
<i>Get on the horn with your institution.
<i>Report on their appetite.</i></i>

04:19.543 --> 04:21.966
<i>These utilities 
are our top priority today.</i>

04:22.045 --> 04:25.867
- <i>Okay, let's go to work.</i>
- And they're off and running.

04:41.632 --> 04:45.864
We cleared up to 60,000 G.C.
at 48 and a half.

04:45.936 --> 04:48.632
Yes, that's right.
Right. 10,000. Right.

04:52.209 --> 04:54.234
- The market just opened. What are you talking about? 
- Runner!

04:55.913 --> 04:58.575
Yeah, here's a hot lead. 
Research just put thrifts on the recommended.

04:58.649 --> 05:01.311
What? Yeah, dump them, for Christ's sake! 
Let's go!

05:01.385 --> 05:06.140
30,000. 3-8 top.
I'd go along at 23. You got it.

05:06.223 --> 05:08.487
Now you own it. Conwest Air?
Let me check it.

05:12.095 --> 05:14.950
10,000 at the quarter.
That's Industrial Oil-

05:15.032 --> 05:17.455
29,000 Niagaras for Templeton.

05:17.534 --> 05:19.456
Mr. Harrison, I don't know
if you're aware of this or not...

05:19.536 --> 05:21.766
but we are in the middle of the biggest 
bull market of our generation...

05:21.838 --> 05:23.499
or any other I've ever witnessed.

05:23.574 --> 05:25.496
No, no, sir,
it's not quite what you think.

05:25.576 --> 05:27.498
If you'd just take
five minutes of your time-

05:27.578 --> 05:30.502
Looking for 50,000 Con Air!
What do you got for me?

05:30.581 --> 05:33.880
September 50s?
How about those Decembers?

05:33.951 --> 05:37.409
Bud Fox, Jackson-Steinem.
Yes, sir, I am aware of that.

05:37.487 --> 05:39.512
If I could just have
five minutes of your time...

05:39.590 --> 05:42.855
to explain the extraordinary opportunities
presently emerging in the international debt market-

05:42.926 --> 05:44.848
- <i>I know all about it.</i>
- No, no, sir-

05:44.928 --> 05:47.954
Bud Fox, Jackson-Steinem.
Yes, I am aware of this, sir.

05:48.031 --> 05:50.625
But if I could just have
five minutes of your time...

05:50.701 --> 05:54.660
to explain the extraordinary opportunities
ptrsently emerging in the international debt market-

05:54.738 --> 05:58.663
I'm sure that, um-

06:04.881 --> 06:09.909
It concerns my future!
I need the information now before the close!

06:09.987 --> 06:13.479
No, in 10 minutes, it's history!
At 4.00, I'm a dinosaur!

06:13.557 --> 06:15.479
Howard, I thought you were a gentleman.

06:15.559 --> 06:17.789
Sure, it's gone down.
But you got the tip, I didn't.

06:17.861 --> 06:20.625
I didn't tell you to buy it.
Why would I tell you to sell it?

06:20.697 --> 06:23.029
- <i>Give it back!</i> 
- Look, give it back to who? I can't give it back.

06:23.100 --> 06:26.297
You own it!
No, he's not here right now.

06:26.370 --> 06:28.668
- That's what you told us to say.
- Give me that phone.

06:28.739 --> 06:31.401
- <i>Hello?</i> 
- Hello.

06:31.475 --> 06:33.991
- <i>Who am I talking to?</i>
- This is the sales manager. 

06:34.011 --> 06:35.400
What seems to be the problem? 

06:35.479 --> 06:37.970
What? Oh, will you give me a break, 
for Christ's sake! 

06:38.015 --> 06:39.880
How the hell was I supposed to know
you were in surgery?

06:39.950 --> 06:42.874
- What am I, Marvin the Mind Reader?
- <i>Want me to pull my account?</i>

06:42.953 --> 06:46.081
Uh, no, sir. I'll discuss that
with the account executive.

06:46.156 --> 06:48.420
- I'll get back to you.
- <i>I appreciate that.</i>

06:48.492 --> 06:50.483
No, sir, you're welcome.

06:53.330 --> 06:56.754
I'm closing the account out.
If he doesn't pay tomorrow, you pay.

06:56.833 --> 06:59.097
Mr. Lynch, I swear to you, he's lying.

06:59.169 --> 07:02.024
We give you one of those rich man's accounts.

07:02.105 --> 07:05.370
You tell me that he's gonna D.K. you
for a lousy quarter point?

07:05.442 --> 07:08.070
I don't think you're being fair, sir.
You assigned me to this guy.

07:08.145 --> 07:12.639
- You know he's got a history of this kind of bullshit! 
- Somebody's got to pay.

07:12.716 --> 07:14.843
Ain't gonna be me.

07:17.521 --> 07:20.684
Buddy, Buddy.
Little trouble, huh, today, Buddy?

07:20.757 --> 07:23.282
Howard the jerk reneged on me.

07:23.360 --> 07:26.921
- I gotta cover his losses that total about seven grand! 
- Yeah, I'm holding. I'm holding.

07:26.997 --> 07:30.387
I'm tapped out, Marv. 
American Express has got a hit man looking for me.

07:30.467 --> 07:35.325
Well, it could've been worse, right?
Could've been my money.

07:35.405 --> 07:38.966
Here, here, rookie.
Let me help you out.

07:39.042 --> 07:41.840
What do I got?
A C-note.

07:41.912 --> 07:46.645
- Thanks, Marv. I'll make it up to you.
- Yes, I am still here!

07:46.717 --> 07:50.983
You know what my dream is? 
Is to one day be on the other end of that phone.

07:51.054 --> 07:55.514
Oh, you got it, baby,
where the real cheesecake is.

07:55.592 --> 08:00.484
Hey, Bud, you forgettin' somethin'?
The Gekko phone call?

08:00.564 --> 08:03.215
Buddy, when are you gonna realize 
it's the big game hunters...

08:03.271 --> 08:05.391
who bag the elephants, 
not guys like us.

08:05.468 --> 08:07.694
- Gordon Gekko, please.
- Oh, Gekko. Gekko's beautifiul.

08:07.771 --> 08:09.693
Thirty seconds after the <i>Challenger</i> blew up...

08:09.773 --> 08:12.037
he's on the phone selling NASA stock short!

08:12.109 --> 08:16.034
Yeah, but 47 million he made 
on the Melcor deal...

08:16.113 --> 08:18.843
23 on the Imperial deal before he was 40.

08:18.915 --> 08:24.239
The guy makes 20 times what Dave Winfield
makes in a year, and he talks to everybody.

08:24.321 --> 08:26.983
And he had an ethical bypass at birth.

08:27.057 --> 08:29.048
- Hello, Natalie? Guess who.
- <i>Mr. Fox.</i>

08:29.126 --> 08:33.448
That's right. Every day I say to myself
that today could be the day.

08:33.530 --> 08:35.452
What do you say, Natalie?
Will you marry me?

08:35.532 --> 08:37.022
- <i>I'll think about it.</i>
- That's terrible.

08:37.067 --> 08:39.922
- Can you please get me through to Mr. Gekko?
- It concerns his fortune.

08:40.003 --> 08:43.302
- <i>He's very busy today.</i>
- So am I. Five minutes. That's all I'm asking.

08:43.373 --> 08:46.638
Mr. Fox, I've told you before,
I'm sure you're a good broker... 

08:46.710 --> 08:49.201
but our traders deal with the brokers.

08:49.279 --> 08:52.134
Mr. Gekko only deals with investment bankers.

08:52.215 --> 08:54.137
<i>Will you at least tell him I called?
There are big changes...</i> 

08:54.217 --> 08:56.139
- <i>taking place in the international debt market.</i>
- I shall give him your message.

08:56.219 --> 08:58.414
Leo, I understand that,
but you have to realize...

08:58.488 --> 09:00.820
there'll be major subordinated  debt involved. 

09:00.891 --> 09:02.882
Yeah.

09:15.305 --> 09:17.796
Hey, Buddy boy, how you doing?

09:17.841 --> 09:20.264
- Great, Charlie. Any better, it'd be a sin.
- You're lookin' good.

09:20.343 --> 09:22.470
Jesus Christ!
Hey, listen. Listen.

09:22.546 --> 09:25.106
I hear all you guys on Wall Street 
are millionaires.

09:25.182 --> 09:28.879
- When you gonna make us all rich?
- You got to open an account to win the lottery.

09:28.952 --> 09:31.682
Look, you give me 50 grand,
I'll get you a condo in Florida next Christmas.

09:31.755 --> 09:33.677
Sure.
We'll own the airline by then.

09:33.757 --> 09:38.023
If he's gonna make anybody rich, let him make
himself rich so he can pay off his school loans.

09:38.094 --> 09:40.119
Nice to see you in such a good mood, Dad.

09:40.197 --> 09:42.222
What'd Mom do, give you fish for dinner?

09:42.299 --> 09:45.962
You're smoking too much. How many times
you gotta go to the hospital to realize-

09:46.036 --> 09:48.698
Leave me alone. It's the only thing
that makes me feel good anymore.

09:48.772 --> 09:50.694
There you go, Frank.
All set.

09:50.774 --> 09:54.437
Spaghetti.
Your mother still makes lousy spaghetti.

09:54.511 --> 09:56.877
It's called pasta now, Dad.
Spaghetti's out of date.

09:56.947 --> 09:58.812
- Yeah, so am I. You want a beer?
- Yeah.

09:58.882 --> 10:03.080
Billy, bring a Molson Light for the kid, 
will ya?

10:03.153 --> 10:05.781
- He's looking good, huh?
- He looks terrific.

10:05.856 --> 10:07.687
- Carl, we're gonna be at the bar.
- All right.

10:07.757 --> 10:09.748
- Nice seeing you, Buddy.
- All right.

10:09.826 --> 10:11.748
- Take care.
- I'll catch up with you.

10:11.828 --> 10:13.420
All right, Charlie.

10:14.631 --> 10:18.192
So, you look like
you've grown another inch...

10:18.268 --> 10:21.157
but you don't look so hot, Buddy.

10:21.238 --> 10:25.095
- Starting to get bags under your eyes like your old man.
- Yeah, I had a tough day.

10:25.175 --> 10:28.064
Some jerk D.K.'d me,
and I got to cover his losses.

10:28.144 --> 10:29.941
- Speak English, will ya?
- D.K.

10:30.013 --> 10:32.743
<i>Didn't know</i> who I was 
when the options he bought took a bath.

10:32.816 --> 10:36.513
- Bastard reneged on me.
- I told you not to get into that racket in the first place. 

10:36.586 --> 10:38.679
You could have been a doctor or a lawyer.

10:38.755 --> 10:40.985
If you'd stayed at Bluestar,
you could have been a supervisor...

10:41.057 --> 10:44.720
in customer relations by now 
instead of going off and being a salesman.

10:44.794 --> 10:47.422
Dad, how many times I gotta tell ya?
I am not a salesman.

10:47.497 --> 10:51.695
I'm an account executive. Pretty soon,
I'll move into the investment banking side.

10:51.768 --> 10:54.601
You get on the phone and ask strangers
for money, right? You're a salesman.

10:54.671 --> 10:58.698
Dad, it takes time. You gotta build a client list. 
I'm doing that.

10:58.775 --> 11:02.700
I could make more money in one year as a broker 
than in five years at this airline.

11:02.779 --> 11:04.906
- Thank you, Billy.
- Thanks.

11:04.981 --> 11:07.905
I don't get it, kid.
You borrow money to go to N.Y.U.

11:07.984 --> 11:10.839
The first year out, you make 35 grand.
You made 50 grand last year.

11:10.921 --> 11:13.412
You still can't pay off your loans.
Where does it all go?

11:13.456 --> 11:16.846
50K does not get you to first base
in the Big Apple, not anymore.

11:16.927 --> 11:19.316
Look, I got 40% in taxes,
15 grand for rent.

11:19.396 --> 11:21.421
I got school loans, car loans, 
food, park my car.

11:21.498 --> 11:24.126
That's three bills a month.
I need good suits- 400 bucks a pop.

11:24.200 --> 11:26.691
So come back home and live rent-free...

11:26.736 --> 11:28.829
instead of that roach-infected place
you're livin' in.

11:28.905 --> 11:32.534
$50,000. Jesus Christ.
The whole world's off its rocker!

11:32.609 --> 11:36.238
You know, I made a total of $47,000 last year. 
That's before taxes.

11:36.313 --> 11:39.942
That's Queens, Dad.
A 5% mortgage, and you rent the top room.

11:40.016 --> 11:41.938
I got to live in Manhattan to be a player.

11:42.018 --> 11:45.442
There is no nobility in poverty anymore, Dad.

11:45.522 --> 11:48.047
One day, you're gonna be proud of me.
You'll see.

11:48.124 --> 11:53.881
It's yourself you got to be proud of, 
Huckle Berry. How much you need?

11:55.699 --> 11:59.521
Can you spare 300?
I'll pay you back next month, I promise.

11:59.602 --> 12:03.163
- I don't know if got that much on me.
- Not in here, please.

12:05.342 --> 12:08.334
It adds up, kid.
You know, 300 here, 200 there.

12:08.411 --> 12:11.676
Well, like I always say, money's only something 
you need in case you don't die tomorrow.

12:11.748 --> 12:13.670
- Ain't that right, Carl?
- Nice seeing you.

12:13.750 --> 12:15.741
- How you doing?
- All right.

12:15.819 --> 12:17.741
How's work been treating you?

12:17.821 --> 12:20.847
Damn mandatory drug tests
are driving my men crazy.

12:20.924 --> 12:24.087
I even got flagged the other day
for my blood pressure pills.

12:24.160 --> 12:26.788
The only good news is we just had 
a meeting with the controller...

12:26.863 --> 12:28.785
about some union business,
and guess what.

12:28.865 --> 12:32.198
- What?
- Remember the accident last year and the investigation?

12:32.268 --> 12:34.327
- Sure.
- The F.A.A. is gonna rule...

12:34.404 --> 12:37.202
it was a manufacturing error
in the door latch mechanism.

12:37.273 --> 12:40.106
I knew it all the time.
I kept telling them it wasn't maintenance.

12:40.176 --> 12:43.304
It was those goddamn greedy manufacturers 
out in Cincinnati.

12:43.380 --> 12:46.872
- That's great, Dad.
- Damn right. This gets us out from under suspension.

12:46.950 --> 12:50.147
We can go for those new routes
to Pittsburgh and Boston now.

12:50.220 --> 12:52.415
We're gonna compete with the big guys.

12:52.489 --> 12:54.684
Well, to Bluestar.
And as your broker...

12:54.758 --> 12:57.488
all I can advise is
you hold on to that stock.

12:57.560 --> 13:00.950
What stock? Are you kidding?

13:01.031 --> 13:04.364
- You sure about this thing?
- What?

13:04.434 --> 13:07.323
- The F.A.A. announcement.
- Sure I'm sure.

13:09.205 --> 13:11.332
Look at me.

13:11.408 --> 13:14.366
You got that mischievous look
in your eye, Buddy.

13:14.444 --> 13:17.333
You used to smile just like that
when you were a kid sleeping.

13:17.414 --> 13:20.247
It's true.
Just like that.

14:01.057 --> 14:02.979
Good morning, Gordon.

14:11.267 --> 14:13.758
<i>I have a delivery for Mr. Gekko.</i>

14:13.803 --> 14:17.466
- <i>It's a personal item, and he needs you to sign for it.</i>
- All right. Send him in.

14:30.286 --> 14:33.676
Hello, Natalie.
Recognize the voice?

14:33.756 --> 14:36.680
I'll give you a hint.
You're thinking seriously about marrying me.

14:36.759 --> 14:39.182
- What are you doing here?
- You are even lovelier than I pictured.

14:39.262 --> 14:41.355
I got a birthday present for Mr. Gekko.

14:41.431 --> 14:43.661
First of all, 
you can't just come barging in here.

14:43.733 --> 14:47.931
- And what makes you think it's his birthday?
- Well, it's in the Bible.

14:48.004 --> 14:50.427
See? You better go buy him a gift.

14:50.507 --> 14:53.067
Please, Natalie, let me give this to him.

14:53.143 --> 14:57.773
Cuban cigars. Davidoff- his favorite.
Very tough to get.

14:57.847 --> 15:00.042
Please, Natalie.

15:02.785 --> 15:05.379
Stay here.
I'll see what I can do.

15:23.773 --> 15:25.695
Wait outside.

15:27.110 --> 15:30.932
Yeah, I'll see you shortly I hope.

15:43.059 --> 15:45.220
Five minutes.

15:51.568 --> 15:54.867
Well, life all comes down to a few moments.

15:54.938 --> 15:56.929
This is one of them.

15:58.908 --> 16:01.433
What the hell's going on?

16:01.511 --> 16:04.071
I'm looking at 200,000 shares move, pal.

16:04.147 --> 16:06.103
I wanna know if we're part of it.

16:06.182 --> 16:09.015
We'd better be, or I'm gonna come down 
and eat your lunch for you.

16:09.085 --> 16:11.315
Back to two, Alex.
Sorry, Jeff.

16:11.387 --> 16:15.278
Look, I loved it at 40.
It's an insult at 50.

16:15.358 --> 16:18.691
Their analysts, they don't know 
preferred stock from livestock, all right?

16:18.761 --> 16:22.219
Wait till it heads south. 
Then we raise the sperm count on the deal, okay?

16:22.298 --> 16:25.222
Get back at ya.

16:25.301 --> 16:29.123
This is the kid who calls me 59 days in a row, 
wants to be a player.

16:29.205 --> 16:33.494
Oughta be a picture of you in the dictionary
under "persistence", kid.

16:33.576 --> 16:36.136
Listen, I'm looking for negative control, okay?

16:36.212 --> 16:40.501
No more than 30%, 35%. Just enough
to block anybody else's merger plans...

16:40.583 --> 16:43.814
and find out from the inside
if the books are cooked.

16:43.886 --> 16:47.549
Looks as good as on paper, 
we're in the kill zone, pal. We lock and load.

16:47.624 --> 16:51.617
Lunch? You gotta be kiddin'. Lunch is for wimps. 
Okay, Billy, I'll talk at ya.

16:54.931 --> 16:58.094
How do you do, Mr. Gekko?
I'm Bud Fox.

16:58.167 --> 17:01.500
So you say. Nice to meet you.
Hope you're intelligent.

17:01.571 --> 17:04.233
- Where did you get these?
- I got a connection at the airport.

17:04.307 --> 17:07.902
So what's on your mind, Kemo Sabe?

17:07.977 --> 17:11.435
Why am I listening to you?
I gotta monitor my blood pressure... 

17:11.513 --> 17:13.743
so whatever you do,
don't upset me here.

17:13.816 --> 17:16.546
- No. No, sir.
- Within 45 seconds...

17:16.618 --> 17:19.917
the microprocessor computes
your systolic and diastolic pressure.

17:19.989 --> 17:23.288
Got an L.C.D. readout.
Cost-effective.

17:23.358 --> 17:26.521
Less than one visit to a doctor.

17:26.596 --> 17:28.928
I just wanna let you know, Mr. Gekko...

17:28.998 --> 17:30.920
that I've read all about you
at N.Y.U. business...

17:31.000 --> 17:33.924
and I think you're an incredible genius.

17:34.003 --> 17:37.234
I've always dreamed of one thing 
and that's to do business with a man like you.

17:37.307 --> 17:39.696
What firm you with, pal?

17:39.776 --> 17:43.701
- Jackson-Steinem.
- They're going places. Good junk bond department.

17:43.780 --> 17:46.271
You the financing on that Janson investment?

17:46.316 --> 17:50.207
Yeah. Yeah, we're working on 
some other interesting stuff.

17:50.286 --> 17:52.447
Cosmetic company, by any chance?

17:52.522 --> 17:55.548
What, are you 12th man on the deal team?
Last to know?

17:55.625 --> 17:57.684
I can't tell you that, Mr. Gekko.

17:57.760 --> 18:00.149
So what do you got for me, sport?
Why are you here?

18:00.229 --> 18:02.993
Chart breakout on this one here.
Whitewood-Young Industries.

18:03.066 --> 18:06.024
Explosive earnings.
A 30% discount from the book.

18:06.102 --> 18:08.627
- Great cash flow. Couple of 5% holders.
- It's a dog.

18:08.705 --> 18:11.265
- Very strong management.
- It's a dog, pal.

18:11.341 --> 18:13.730
What else you got
besides connections at the airport?

18:13.810 --> 18:16.734
Mr. Stevenson in San Francisco. 

18:20.550 --> 18:22.472
He respond to the offer?

18:22.552 --> 18:25.680
- What?
- <i>He's in Chicago.</i>

18:25.755 --> 18:28.246
What the hell is Cromwell doing 
giving a lecture tour...

18:28.291 --> 18:30.555
when he's losing 60 million a quarter?

18:30.626 --> 18:33.390
Guess he's giving lectures on how
to lose money. Jesus Christ!

18:33.463 --> 18:36.227
If this guy owned a funeral parlor,
no one would die.

18:36.299 --> 18:39.359
- This turkey is totally brain-dead!
- <i>All right, Gordon.</i>

18:39.435 --> 18:43.394
Okay. All right. Christmas is over,
and business is business.

18:43.473 --> 18:46.533
You keep on buying.
Dilute the son of a bitch!

18:46.609 --> 18:50.306
Ollie, I want every orifice
in his fucking body flowing red.

18:50.380 --> 18:52.507
He's flowing, Gordo.
Piece of cake.

18:52.582 --> 18:54.971
Doesn't look like it.
This guy's the best trader on the streets.

18:55.051 --> 19:00.011
Susan, get me the L.B.O. analysis on Teldar Paper. 
Bring it in here, please.

19:00.089 --> 19:03.183
- <i>Mr. Gekko, your wife.</i>
- What else? What else you got?

19:03.259 --> 19:06.114
Tarafly.
Analysts don't like it.

19:06.195 --> 19:09.551
I do. The breakup value 
is twice the market price.

19:09.632 --> 19:12.931
This deal finances itself.
You sell off two divisions-

19:13.002 --> 19:16.130
That's not bad for a quant,
but that's a dog with different fleas.

19:16.205 --> 19:19.629
Come on, pal.
Tell me something I don't know.

19:19.709 --> 19:24.100
It's my birthday.
Surprise me.

19:27.683 --> 19:30.709
- Bluestar.
- What?

19:30.787 --> 19:35.212
- Bluestar Airlines.
- Rings a bell somewhere. So what?

19:35.291 --> 19:38.624
It's a comer.
Eighty medium-body jets.

19:38.694 --> 19:41.891
300 pilots.
Flies Florida...

19:41.964 --> 19:45.627
Canada, uh, northeast,
Caribbean, great slots in major cities.

19:45.701 --> 19:48.226
I don't like airlines.
Lousy unions.

19:48.304 --> 19:51.398
Well, there was a crash last year.

19:51.474 --> 19:54.204
They just got a favorable ruling on a lawsuit.

19:54.277 --> 19:56.199
Even the plaintiffs don't know about it.

19:56.279 --> 19:58.873
Well, how do you know about it?

20:00.850 --> 20:02.806
I just know.

20:02.885 --> 20:06.309
The decision should clear the way
for new planes and route contracts.

20:06.389 --> 20:09.085
There's only a small float out there,
so you should grab it.

20:09.158 --> 20:13.049
- Good for a five-point pop.
- Just got 250,000 shares at 18 and a quarter from Janson. 

20:13.129 --> 20:16.690
Think I can pull twice that at 18 and a half 
from the California pensions.

20:16.766 --> 20:19.257
We got close to a half a million shares 
in the bag.

20:19.335 --> 20:21.257
Huh? The Terminator!

20:21.337 --> 20:24.192
Blow them away, Ollie!

20:24.273 --> 20:26.764
And I'm pretty sure we got
the Beezer brothers coming in with us.

20:26.809 --> 20:28.731
And I'm working on the Silverberg boys.

20:28.811 --> 20:32.736
Rip their fucking throats out.
Stuff them in your garbage compactor.

20:32.815 --> 20:36.546
- You got a card?
- Home number's on the back.

20:36.619 --> 20:40.214
Bud Fox, I look at 100 deals a day.

20:40.289 --> 20:42.655
- I choose one.
- I hope to hear from you, sir.

20:42.725 --> 20:45.717
Thanks for the cigars.
Let's go, guys.

20:45.795 --> 20:48.355
Looks like we're going over 5% in Teldar.

20:48.431 --> 20:51.355
Start the lawyers on a tender offer at 13 "D".

20:51.434 --> 20:54.232
We buy everything in sight.
We don't pay over 22.

20:54.303 --> 20:58.364
Now, they're gonna fight. 
They got Myers and Thromburg doing their legal.

21:00.142 --> 21:02.565
- Thanks, Natalie.
- Have a nice day, Mr. Fox.

21:02.645 --> 21:04.567
Mr. Gekko, your confierence call is ready.

21:04.647 --> 21:07.571
Mr. Sugarman and Mr. Lorenzo in Delaware, 
Mr. Bernard in Los Angeles...

21:07.650 --> 21:10.744
Mr. Jackson and Miss Roscoe in London- 
they're all on.

21:10.820 --> 21:14.210
But, please, I'm begging you.
I'm- I'm in a bind down here.

21:14.290 --> 21:16.383
We've got all these damn new computers...

21:16.459 --> 21:19.249
and young men that are edging me out here.

21:21.330 --> 21:24.288
Hey, Bud?
Bud, did he see you?

21:24.367 --> 21:26.665
Yeah, he saw right through me.

21:26.736 --> 21:28.829
Cheer up, Buddy, Buddy.
You shook Gekko the Great's hand.

21:28.905 --> 21:33.660
You still got all your fingers. Besides, 
this clown is not the only elephant in the jungle.

21:33.743 --> 21:36.667
Holy cow. Did you get something from him? 
Teldar Paper, huh?

21:36.746 --> 21:41.069
Nah.
It's a dog with fleas.

21:41.150 --> 21:46.474
Fox, where have you been
for the last three hours?

21:46.556 --> 21:50.117
If I were you, 
and I thank my personal God I am not...

21:50.192 --> 21:53.025
I wouldn't be sitting around chin-wagging.

21:53.095 --> 21:59.022
Plenty of six-figure names
in that zip code file to cold-call.

22:01.037 --> 22:03.699
Buddy, got tickets for the Knick game tonight.

22:03.773 --> 22:06.196
Go out and cruise some chicks afterwards.
This is gonna be awesome.

22:06.275 --> 22:08.300
- What do you say?
- Nah, I gotta read my charts. 

22:08.377 --> 22:10.333
Come on.
Forget charts, will you?

22:10.413 --> 22:13.302
We're not fund managers here.
Churn them and burn them.

22:13.382 --> 22:15.873
I am offering you the Knicks and chicks.

22:15.918 --> 22:18.216
God help you before you turn
into poor Steeples over there.

22:21.724 --> 22:23.646
Preferably Lou Mannheim.

22:23.726 --> 22:26.854
Oh, yeah. Nice guy, swell fella. 
But he's a loser.

22:26.929 --> 22:30.160
He lost all his equity when the firm 
went belly-up in the recession of '71.

22:30.232 --> 22:33.429
You wanna be coming in here
in your late 60s still pitchin'?

22:33.502 --> 22:36.630
Bud, whatever happened to that cute analyst 
over at Thudder and Wicks?

22:36.706 --> 22:39.197
- Sidney? Susan? What was her name?
- Cindy.

22:39.241 --> 22:42.005
Having sex with her was like
reading <i>The Wall Street Journal.</i>

22:42.078 --> 22:44.239
- She had a heartbeat.
- You wanna bet?

22:44.313 --> 22:48.374
I gotta get to work. 
Z's today.

22:48.451 --> 22:50.715
Call for you, Buddy!
Pick up two!

22:52.288 --> 22:54.210
Bud Fox.

22:54.290 --> 22:56.383
All right, Bud Fox...

22:56.459 --> 23:00.691
I want you to buy 20,000 shares of Bluestar...

23:00.763 --> 23:05.826
at 15 and an eighth,
three-eighths tops.

23:05.901 --> 23:09.689
And don't screw it up, sport.
Think you can handle that?

23:09.772 --> 23:14.004
Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.
You won't regret this.

23:14.076 --> 23:17.409
Whoo! 
Marv, I just bagged the elephant!

23:18.814 --> 23:20.702
Gekko.

23:54.917 --> 23:58.409
- Hiya, sport.
- Nice to see you again, Mr. Gekko.

23:58.487 --> 24:00.284
Hey, try the steak tartare.
It's off the menu.

24:00.356 --> 24:03.052
- Louis will make it for you.
- Of course, sir.

24:03.125 --> 24:06.822
- Anything to drink, sir?
- Just an Evian, please.

24:06.896 --> 24:09.922
Hey, see this?
Can you believe it?

24:09.999 --> 24:12.297
- It's got a two-inch screen.
- I can hardly see it.

24:14.070 --> 24:16.129
It's for my kid Rudy.
Three years old.

24:16.205 --> 24:20.301
He's an electronics freak. 
I tell you, we're going to a new age, pal.

24:20.376 --> 24:24.335
- Check. So how's business today?
- Great.

24:24.413 --> 24:28.611
Bluestar was at 17 and a quarter
when I left the office up from 15.

24:28.684 --> 24:31.778
- Might spin up to 18 by the bell.
- Teldar's shooting up.

24:31.854 --> 24:34.448
Did you buy any for yourself?

24:34.523 --> 24:39.483
I bet you were on the phone two minutes
after you got out of my office, huh?

24:39.562 --> 24:41.587
No, sir, that wouldn't have been legal.

24:41.664 --> 24:44.690
Sure.

24:44.767 --> 24:48.533
Relax, pal,
No one's gonna blow the whistle on you.

24:48.604 --> 24:51.767
Is that legal? 
Why don't you put that in my account.

24:51.841 --> 24:56.164
- Hey, Gordon.
- Georgie, the cellular king. How you been, pal?

24:56.245 --> 24:59.544
- Monique. So nice to see you, my dear.
- Hello, Gordon.

24:59.615 --> 25:02.675
- You look wonderful.
- You're looking very, very well yourself.

25:02.752 --> 25:06.540
And Mr. Davis.
Yes. Good.

25:06.622 --> 25:09.955
Can I get the check here, please?
For Christ's sakes!

25:10.025 --> 25:13.188
That should cover that Bluestar buy.
Put a couple hundred thou...

25:13.262 --> 25:15.389
on one of those bow-wow stocks you mentioned.

25:15.464 --> 25:17.455
Pick the dog with the least fleas.

25:17.533 --> 25:21.230
Use a stop loss 
so your downside is 100 thou.

25:21.303 --> 25:23.533
And buy a decent suit.

25:23.606 --> 25:25.528
You can't come in here looking like this.

25:25.608 --> 25:28.304
- Go to Morty Sills. Tell him I sent you.
- Yes, sir.

25:28.377 --> 25:30.402
Thank you, Mr. Gekko.
Thank you for the chance.

25:30.479 --> 25:33.403
You will not regret this.
You're with a winner.

25:33.482 --> 25:37.248
Right. Right.

25:37.319 --> 25:39.810
Put the rest of the money
in a tax-free mutual fund.

25:39.855 --> 25:42.221
I wanna see how you do before I invest it.

25:42.291 --> 25:44.816
And save the cheap salesman talk, will ya? 
It's obvious.

25:44.894 --> 25:48.091
- Excuse me, sir?
- You heard me.

25:48.164 --> 25:50.325
I don't like losses, sport.

25:50.399 --> 25:52.697
Nothing ruins my day more than losses.

25:52.768 --> 25:55.999
Now, you do good, you get perks...

25:56.071 --> 25:58.995
lots and lots of perks.

25:59.074 --> 26:00.939
- Louis?
- Yes, sir.

26:01.010 --> 26:04.901
Take care of my friend.
Have a good lunch, Buddy.

26:06.882 --> 26:09.248
Hi, Richard.
How are you?

26:09.318 --> 26:11.309
Congratulations.

26:38.848 --> 26:41.544
- Hi, Bud.
- Hi.

26:41.617 --> 26:44.916
I'm Lisa, a friend of Gordon's.

26:46.422 --> 26:50.085
Lisa? Gordon?
Oh, oh, Mr. Gekko. Sure.

26:50.159 --> 26:54.255
Uh, would you like to come in?

26:54.330 --> 26:59.563
Didn't he tell you?
Oh, that's so like Gordon.

26:59.635 --> 27:03.423
Why don't you get dressed.
We're going out.

27:03.505 --> 27:06.099
- We are?
- Mmm.

27:22.057 --> 27:24.218
Thanks.

27:24.293 --> 27:26.591
So, where are we going?

27:26.662 --> 27:29.324
Wherever you like.

27:29.398 --> 27:33.926
Lutece, 21, the River Cafe.

27:34.003 --> 27:37.131
Or maybe we could just-

27:37.206 --> 27:39.595
drive around for a while...

27:41.577 --> 27:43.533
work up an appetite.

27:47.249 --> 27:50.173
- Want some?
- Sure.

27:54.223 --> 27:57.317
Gordon tells me 
that you're a very talented broker.

27:59.194 --> 28:01.958
What do you like?

28:02.031 --> 28:04.226
Like? Well-

28:04.300 --> 28:08.293
I've got this guy who should know,
tells me to buy Hewlett-Packard.

28:08.370 --> 28:11.498
But I've been burned on tips.

28:11.573 --> 28:15.964
Um, Hewlett. Well, let's see.
It closed at 41 and a quarter.

28:16.045 --> 28:19.139
Up an eighth.
Very attractive.

28:19.214 --> 28:23.480
- Uh-huh.
- About average yield.

28:23.552 --> 28:25.474
- Very attractive.
- Mmm.

28:25.554 --> 28:27.920
- Rising profits.
- Ooh.

28:27.990 --> 28:30.083
Strong balance sheet.

28:30.159 --> 28:33.549
- You're hot on this stock.
- Uh-

28:33.629 --> 28:35.620
It's ready to take off.

28:35.698 --> 28:39.862
I'd jump all over it if I were you.

28:40.069 --> 28:42.025
Good morning, Carolyn.

28:42.104 --> 28:44.026
Morning, Buddy.
You look happy.

28:44.106 --> 28:46.028
Well, any better, and I'd be guilty.

28:46.108 --> 28:51.239
- You were never that innocent, sugar pie.
- How do you know? You wish.

30:07.022 --> 30:09.388
Goddamn!

30:09.458 --> 30:11.688
We sure went down the toilet
on that ugly bitch.

30:11.760 --> 30:14.684
Buddy, Mr. Gekko's office
is looking for you.

30:14.763 --> 30:17.493
Be at the Wyatt Club courts at 6:00.

30:29.011 --> 30:32.538
Come on, sport.
You got to try harder.

30:32.614 --> 30:36.038
You need some exercise, 
for Christ's sakes. 

30:36.118 --> 30:38.450
I don't think I can go on, Mr. Gekko.

30:38.520 --> 30:42.149
Let's go, Buddy.
Push yourself. Finish out the game.

30:42.067 --> 30:45.332
Very nice club, Mr. Gekko.

30:45.404 --> 30:47.326
Yeah.

30:47.406 --> 30:51.831
Not bad for a city college boy.
I bought my way in.

30:51.910 --> 30:57.268
Now all these Ivy League schmucks
are sucking my kneecaps.

30:57.349 --> 31:00.648
I just got on the board of the Bronx Zoo.

31:00.719 --> 31:03.711
It cost me a mil.

31:03.789 --> 31:06.519
That's the thing 
you've got to remember about WASPs- 

31:06.591 --> 31:10.186
they love animals,
they can't stand people.

31:12.164 --> 31:18.091
Uh, Mr. Gekko, we took a little loss today.

31:18.170 --> 31:22.095
We got stomped out on Tarafly.
About 100 grand.

31:27.112 --> 31:30.172
Well, I guess your dad's not 
a union representative of that company, huh?

31:30.248 --> 31:33.376
How do you know about my father?

31:35.120 --> 31:39.648
The most valuable commodity
I know of is information.

31:39.725 --> 31:42.319
Wouldn't you agree?

31:42.394 --> 31:45.022
Yeah.

31:50.035 --> 31:53.425
The public's out there
throwing darts at a board, sport.

31:55.207 --> 31:57.801
I don't throw darts at a board.

31:57.876 --> 32:01.073
I bet on sure things.

32:01.146 --> 32:03.979
Read Sun Tzu, <i>The Art of War.</i>

32:04.049 --> 32:09.737
"Every battle is won before it's ever fought."
Think about it.

32:09.821 --> 32:13.552
You're not as smart
as I thought you were, Buddy boy.

32:13.625 --> 32:17.914
You ever wonder why fund managers
can't beat the S&P 500?

32:17.996 --> 32:21.227
'Cause they're sheep,
and sheep get slaughtered.

32:23.201 --> 32:26.125
I've been in this business since '69.

32:26.204 --> 32:29.935
Most of these Harvard M.B.A. types,
they don't add up to dog shit.

32:30.008 --> 32:34.707
Give me guys that are poor, smart and hungry, 
and no feelings.

32:34.780 --> 32:39.274
You win a few, you lose a few,
but you keep on fighting.

32:39.351 --> 32:41.307
And if you need a friend,
get a dog.

32:41.386 --> 32:45.413
It's trench warfare out there, pal.
Hey, Georgie.

32:45.490 --> 32:47.549
- Hey, Gordon.
- How's Larchmont treating you?

32:47.626 --> 32:50.515
Fine.
How's the Praxer deal going?

32:50.595 --> 32:54.986
- You should know, pal.
- Asshole.

32:55.067 --> 32:57.456
And inside here too.

32:57.536 --> 33:03.133
I got 20 other brokers analyzing charts, pal.
I don't need another one.

33:03.208 --> 33:05.540
See you around, Buddy.

33:05.610 --> 33:09.706
I am not just another broker, Mr. Gekko.

33:09.781 --> 33:12.011
If you give me another chance,
I'll prove that to you.

33:12.084 --> 33:16.009
I'll go the extra yard.
Just one more chance. Please!

33:16.088 --> 33:17.749
- You want another chance?
- Fuckin'-A!

33:17.823 --> 33:23.216
Then you stop sending me information,
and you start getting me some.

33:23.295 --> 33:26.822
Get dressed. I'll show you my charts.

33:29.301 --> 33:31.223
You know the name?

33:31.303 --> 33:33.931
Of course. Larry Wildman, 
one of the first raiders.

33:34.005 --> 33:36.428
Sir Larry Wildman.
Like all Brits...

33:36.508 --> 33:39.102
thinks he was born
with a better pot to piss in.

33:39.177 --> 33:41.907
Bribed an old secretary of mine.
Opened her mouth...

33:41.980 --> 33:45.507
stole R.D.L. Pharmaceuticals
right from under me.

33:45.584 --> 33:49.816
- Wildman, the white knight.
- I remember that deal. You were involved Mr. Gekko?

33:49.888 --> 33:54.018
Payback time, sport.
You see that building?

33:54.092 --> 33:58.654
I bought that building 10 years ago.
My first real estate deal.

33:58.730 --> 34:03.895
Sold it two years later.
Made an $800,000 profit.

34:03.969 --> 34:06.597
It was better than sex.

34:06.671 --> 34:09.504
At that time, I thought
that was all the money in the world.

34:09.574 --> 34:12.600
Now it's a day's pay.

34:12.677 --> 34:16.237
Anyway, I had a mole in Wildman's operation.

34:16.313 --> 34:18.942
He gave me half the picture,
then he got fired.

34:19.016 --> 34:20.746
I don't think I follow, Mr. Gekko.

34:20.819 --> 34:25.016
Wildman's in town.
He just became an American citizen.

34:25.090 --> 34:27.752
Something big is going down, okay?

34:27.826 --> 34:30.056
I wanna know where he goes
and what he sees.

34:30.128 --> 34:33.359
I want you, pal,
to fill out the missing picture.

34:35.033 --> 34:38.196
Uh, Mr. Gekko, it's not exactly what I do.

34:38.270 --> 34:40.192
I could-
I could lose my license.

34:40.272 --> 34:44.094
If the S.E.C. found out, I could go to jail.
That's inside information, isn't it?

34:46.277 --> 34:50.703
You mean like when a father tells a son
about a court ruling on an airline?

34:50.782 --> 34:53.080
Or someone overhears 
that I'm buying Teldar Paper...

34:53.150 --> 34:55.072
and decides he's gonna buy 
some for himself?

34:55.152 --> 35:00.011
Or the chairman of the board of X.Y.Z.
decides it's time to blow out X.Y.Z.?

35:00.091 --> 35:02.355
Is that what you mean?

35:05.063 --> 35:09.818
I'm afraid, pal, unless your father's on
the board of directors of another company...

35:09.901 --> 35:13.962
you and I are gonna have 
a very tough time doing business together.

35:14.039 --> 35:17.372
- What about hard work?
- What about it? You work hard?

35:17.442 --> 35:20.639
Bet you stayed up all night analyzing
that dog shit stock you gave me, huh?

35:20.712 --> 35:23.101
Where'd it get you?
My father, he worked like an elephant...

35:23.181 --> 35:26.912
pushing electrical supplies till he dropped dead
at 49 with a heart attack and tax bills.

35:26.985 --> 35:29.215
Wake up, will you, pal?

35:29.287 --> 35:32.552
If you're not inside,
you are outside, okay?

35:32.624 --> 35:36.185
And I'm not talking about some
$400,000-a-year working Wall Street stiff...

35:36.261 --> 35:38.217
flying first class and being comfortable.

35:38.296 --> 35:40.890
I'm talking about liquid.

35:40.966 --> 35:44.060
Rich enough to have your own jet.

35:44.135 --> 35:46.990
Rich enough not to waste time.

35:47.072 --> 35:51.964
Fifty, $100 million, Buddy.
A player...

35:52.043 --> 35:54.705
or nothing.

35:56.681 --> 36:00.208
Now, you had what it took
to get in my office.

36:00.285 --> 36:03.709
The real question is whether you got 
what it takes to stay.

36:08.159 --> 36:10.354
Look at that.
Are you gonna tell me...

36:10.428 --> 36:14.319
the difference between this guy
and that guy is luck?

36:14.399 --> 36:17.732
Mohammed, pull over, will you?

36:17.802 --> 36:20.794
I hope you don't mind
if I drop you off here. I'm late.

36:20.872 --> 36:25.536
Buddy, it's been nice meeting you, okay?

36:47.666 --> 36:53.024
All right, Mr. Gekko, you got me.

37:54.232 --> 37:56.359
- Excuse me, please.
- Excuse us.

37:56.434 --> 37:58.425
Excuse me.

38:13.118 --> 38:15.484
I'm sorry, sir.
Do you have a reservation?

38:15.553 --> 38:19.114
- Uh, table for one.
- Reservations only. We're booked for a whole week. 

38:19.190 --> 38:21.420
- Please give us a call.
- All right. Don't touch.

38:49.087 --> 38:51.214
Everything ready, sir.

39:06.905 --> 39:10.432
Excuse me! Excuse me.
Mr. Wildman on board that plane?

39:10.508 --> 39:13.306
- Yeah.
- Shit! My boss is gonna kill me.

39:13.378 --> 39:16.267
I was supposed to give him this.
You know where that plane is going?

39:16.347 --> 39:19.874
- Erie, Pennsylvania.
- Thank you.

39:21.386 --> 39:23.377
After spending the morning at Kahn-Seidelman...

39:23.455 --> 39:27.152
on the 14th floor of the junk bond department
where Shane Mora works...

39:27.225 --> 39:29.921
he had lunch at that
French restaurant <i>Le Circus</i>... 

39:29.994 --> 39:32.326
with a group of well-dressed
heavy set bean counters.

39:32.397 --> 39:34.490
<i>He later stopped off at Morgan.</i>

39:34.566 --> 39:37.262
<i>I'd say from all the sweet smiling
and palm pressing going on...</i>

39:37.335 --> 39:39.895
that Larry got himself
some nice fat financing, G.G. 

39:39.971 --> 39:41.996
Bright, but not bright enough, Sherlock.

39:42.073 --> 39:44.667
Let's roll the dice
and play a little Monopoly.

39:44.742 --> 39:48.041
What box is Sir Larry gonna land on 
in Erie, Pennsylvania?

39:50.215 --> 39:53.446
Jesus Christ!
He's buying Anacott Steel.

39:53.518 --> 39:56.681
Okay. When the market opens tomorrow...

39:56.754 --> 40:01.020
I want you to buy 1,500 July 50 calls.

40:01.092 --> 40:02.821
- You hear me?
- <i>1,500. Yes, sir.</i>

40:02.894 --> 40:07.684
Start buying 1,000-share blocks,
and take it up to $50.

40:07.765 --> 40:12.122
When it reaches 50,
give out a little taste to your friends.

40:12.203 --> 40:17.891
Then I want you to call
<i>The Wall Street Chronicle,</i> extension 1605.

40:17.976 --> 40:22.970
You tell the man,
"Blue Horseshoe loves Anacott Steel."

40:23.047 --> 40:25.311
- You got that?
- <i>The Wall Street Chronicle.</i>

40:25.383 --> 40:28.216
All right.
Congratulations, Buddy. You scored.

40:28.286 --> 40:30.208
- <i>I'll talk at you.</i>
- All right.

40:32.924 --> 40:36.087
Start buying Anacott Steel across the board.

40:36.160 --> 40:41.757
Use the offshore accounts.
And keep it quiet.

40:49.340 --> 40:53.071
Frank, 10,000 A.N.C. at 46.
Let me know how the options are opening, okay?

40:53.144 --> 40:55.066
Thank you.

40:58.416 --> 41:00.338
Jackson-Steinem.

41:03.187 --> 41:05.314
How-
How is Anacott Steel?

41:05.390 --> 41:08.279
- Five and three-quarters six. 2,000 up.
- Six for 10,000.

41:08.359 --> 41:10.281
I'll sell you 2,000.
2,000 Anacott.

41:10.361 --> 41:14.252
That's not what I said.
I said 20,000 shares.

41:21.906 --> 41:25.171
Anacott priced at six.
What do you wanna buy-

41:25.243 --> 41:27.973
- And a quarter. 8,000 at a quarter?
- I'll take 8,000 at a quarter.

41:28.046 --> 41:30.708
Make it six to a half. 2,000 up. 
What do you wanna do?

41:30.782 --> 41:33.148
Yeah, I know what time it is.

41:33.217 --> 41:35.640
I realize that the market-
This is what I'm saying to you.

41:35.720 --> 41:38.086
We have important financial news, 
Mr. Earlich...

41:38.156 --> 41:41.648
important financial news 
that just happens to concern your future.

41:41.726 --> 41:44.581
You could benefit a great-
Oh, come on. What the hell's going on?

41:44.662 --> 41:48.325
Anacott Steel.
Put your best customers in it.

41:50.835 --> 41:54.396
Lou, I got a sure thing.
Anacott Steel.

41:54.472 --> 41:57.737
No such thing except death and taxes.

41:57.809 --> 42:01.905
Not a good company anymore.
No fundamentals.

42:01.980 --> 42:04.278
What's going on, Bud?

42:06.184 --> 42:09.210
You know something?

42:09.287 --> 42:12.916
Remember, there are no shortcuts, son.

42:12.991 --> 42:16.051
Quick-buck artists come and go
with every bull market...

42:16.127 --> 42:19.119
but the steady players make it 
through the bear markets.

42:19.197 --> 42:21.529
You're a part of something here, Bud.

42:21.599 --> 42:24.989
The money you make for people
creates science and research jobs.

42:25.069 --> 42:27.560
- Don't sell that out.
- You're right, Lou. You're right.

42:27.605 --> 42:29.527
But you've got to get to the big time first. 

42:29.607 --> 42:31.632
Then you can be a pillar
and do good things.

42:31.709 --> 42:33.700
You can't get a little bit pregnant, son.

42:33.778 --> 42:37.874
Lou, trust me.
It's a winner. Buy it.

42:37.949 --> 42:41.737
Then we'll kamikaze over to Nell's
and chase a little cotton underwear.

42:41.819 --> 42:44.413
I know this 18-year-old bimbette
that's just gorgeous.

42:44.489 --> 42:47.014
- Wait a minute. Hold on. Hold on.
- Play some tennis Saturday?

42:47.091 --> 42:49.924
Me teach you how to play tennis. Can't. 
I'm going fly-fishing in Canada.

42:49.994 --> 42:51.916
Really big client.

42:51.996 --> 42:54.726
- Did you take Anacott?
- Light snack, but good. Thanks, pal.

42:54.799 --> 42:57.563
Sharking your way up.
Yeah, sure.

42:57.635 --> 43:00.866
No, no, my dear,
you've got to diversify.

43:00.938 --> 43:03.964
I got a sure thing.
Anacott Steel.

43:04.042 --> 43:06.704
I've just heard the most lovely two words.

43:08.846 --> 43:10.905
Blue Horseshoe loves Anacott Steel.

43:10.982 --> 43:12.574
- <i>Anacott Steel?</i>
- Right.

43:26.931 --> 43:29.422
Looks like Anacott Steel's in play.

43:29.467 --> 43:31.526
Check the arbs.

43:33.504 --> 43:35.995
Looks like it's being accumulated.
We've got to position it. 

43:36.074 --> 43:39.373
Yeah, Lou, Anacott.
High buy.

43:39.444 --> 43:41.639
Yeah.
Take it and bid it.

43:41.713 --> 43:44.477
If I'm right, eighths and quarters won't matter. 
I'm taking Anacott.

43:44.549 --> 43:47.347
This is really special.
Anacott. Make the tape.

43:47.418 --> 43:49.682
- Bet the ranch.
- Buy 100,000 shares.

43:49.754 --> 43:52.518
- Wildman is sniffing around.
- It's on automatic pilot to the moon.

43:52.590 --> 43:55.923
- If it hits 75, we could clean close to 24 mil.
- <i>Thanks, pal.</i>

43:55.993 --> 43:59.986
First lesson in business: 
Don't get emotional about stock. Clouds the judgment.

44:00.064 --> 44:02.225
<i>Which closed at 51 and an eighth...</i>

44:02.300 --> 44:05.428
<i>up five and one eighth 
from yesterday's close on heavy trading.</i>

44:21.285 --> 44:23.879
- Can I help you?
- Yes, I'm Bud Fox.

44:23.955 --> 44:25.877
I have some papers for Mr. Gekko to sign.

44:25.957 --> 44:27.879
- Come in.
- Thank you.

44:30.795 --> 44:33.459
- I'm sorry about this, Mr. Gekko.
- It's all right. It's okay.

44:35.533 --> 44:38.024
All right. You wanna wait here?
That'd be great.

44:38.069 --> 44:40.867
- Problems?
- There's no problem. This is Bud Fox.

44:40.938 --> 44:42.530
- My wife Kate.
- Hello.

44:42.607 --> 44:44.529
- A pleasure.
- You came out from the city?

44:44.609 --> 44:48.602
- Yes, ma'am.
- Ah. Long drive. You want a drink?

44:48.679 --> 44:51.842
- Yeah, you want a drink? Um, sure.
- If you'd rather not-

44:51.916 --> 44:55.147
No, no, no. Come on. Have a drink. 
Get to meet all the people.

44:55.219 --> 44:57.847
It's a good idea.

44:57.922 --> 45:01.483
That's Sam Ruspoli, Carmen Winters,
Stone Livingston.

45:01.559 --> 45:03.481
- This is Bud Fox.
- <i>May I offer you a drink?</i>

45:03.561 --> 45:07.383
His illustrious wife Muffie.
Candice Rogers. Dick Brady.

45:07.465 --> 45:11.595
- Darien Taylor. All old friends.
- Hi.

45:13.738 --> 45:15.660
Hello.

45:15.740 --> 45:19.096
Great idea, Gordon.
I know good help is hard to find...

45:19.177 --> 45:22.305
but can he create a dry vodka martini?

45:22.380 --> 45:25.042
Doesn't talk back,
doesn't steal the silverware.

45:25.116 --> 45:27.949
And Dick here, he's gonna get me an exemption, 
aren't you, Dick?

45:28.019 --> 45:30.408
I'm in St. Kitts...

45:30.488 --> 45:34.447
with this new Kamali leopard skin 
V-cut bikini...

45:34.525 --> 45:38.188
which is gonna turn back the clock
on my marriage, like, five years.

45:38.262 --> 45:40.628
- You know what I mean?
- Call for you, sir.

45:40.698 --> 45:43.326
Sir Lawrence Wildman.
He says it's important.

45:43.401 --> 45:47.292
Thank you, Nyun. 
Would you fix Mr. Livingston another Martini.

45:47.371 --> 45:49.293
Stick around.
This could be fun.

45:49.373 --> 45:54.367
It's all because this Ukrainian bitch
botched the job on my wax on my bikini line.

45:54.445 --> 45:56.367
Oh, how ghastly!
You should sue her.

45:56.447 --> 45:59.939
- Larry, what a surprise.
- <i>I want to see you, Gordon.</i>

46:00.017 --> 46:02.645
Well, can it wait till tomorrow?
I've got some people over here tonight.

46:02.720 --> 46:05.348
- <i>No, this can't wait. It's important.</i>
- Okay.

46:05.423 --> 46:08.017
All right, if you feel that way,
come on over.

46:09.660 --> 46:13.084
Ah! There you are.
Listen, can I steal him for a minute?

46:13.164 --> 46:15.086
- Of course.
- I want your opinion.

46:15.166 --> 46:17.157
Okay.
About what?

46:23.708 --> 46:25.630
So what do you see in this?

46:30.514 --> 46:33.278
Purity, innocence.

46:34.785 --> 46:38.312
A few thousand dollars down the tubes
if you ask me.

46:38.389 --> 46:40.277
Really?

46:40.358 --> 46:43.748
Well, I guess you can kiss your career
as an art appraiser good-bye...

46:43.828 --> 46:47.616
'cause we paid over 400,000 for it 
at the contemporary picture sale last year.

46:47.698 --> 46:49.962
Jesus. You could have had
a whole beach house for that.

46:50.034 --> 46:55.927
Sure you could, in Wildwood, New Jersey.

46:56.007 --> 46:59.670
If you sold this one, you could have 
a pretty nice penthouse on 5th.

47:01.178 --> 47:03.874
But you wouldn't have
much left over for decoration.

47:03.948 --> 47:06.280
It's nice if you're on mushrooms.

47:06.350 --> 47:08.978
Boy, I thought Gordon
was a real tough businessman.

47:09.053 --> 47:12.318
- He's really taken a bath on that.
- A bath?

47:12.390 --> 47:17.020
I'd say Gordon is one 
of the most astute collectors around.

47:17.094 --> 47:20.985
He has a great eye
and he only buys the best.

47:21.065 --> 47:26.389
Like this rug, for instance.
A Bokara. The finest of its kind. 

47:26.470 --> 47:29.997
The day after he bought it in London,
a dealer representing the Saudi royal family...

47:30.074 --> 47:31.996
offered him twice what he paid.

47:32.076 --> 47:34.909
It absolutely makes the room.

47:34.979 --> 47:37.243
See how this little bit of celadon 
in the border...

47:37.315 --> 47:39.681
is picked up by these cushions
on the sofa?

47:39.750 --> 47:43.880
Although, it's sacrilege having that Etruscan vase 
on the center of the coffee table.

47:43.955 --> 47:46.480
Some dope might use it as an ashtray.

47:46.557 --> 47:48.752
I guess you're a decorator?

47:48.826 --> 47:52.557
You got it. 
A great spender of other people's money.

47:52.630 --> 47:57.055
Well, if you're that good, 
I'm sure you could do wonders with my place.

47:57.134 --> 48:00.023
- Where would that be?
- Upper West Side.

48:00.104 --> 48:05.303
Really? Home of the exposed brick wall
and the house plant?

48:05.376 --> 48:08.402
Well, it's just a rental.
I'll be moving to the East Side soon.

48:08.479 --> 48:12.575
Couple of deals brewing with Gordon.
But that's just conversation.

48:12.650 --> 48:17.542
What about real things, like dinner,
the two of us, next Friday...

48:17.621 --> 48:19.543
Cafe Santa Domingo?

48:19.623 --> 48:22.786
What if I have a previous engagement?

48:22.860 --> 48:26.626
- You break it.
- There you go again, Darien.

48:26.697 --> 48:29.393
Talking with strange men.

48:29.467 --> 48:31.389
- Hello.
- Hello.

48:31.469 --> 48:35.132
Sam, do you know Bud Fox?
Sam, he's in banking. Works for Gordon.

48:35.206 --> 48:37.766
- Nice meeting you.
- Nice to meet you.

48:37.842 --> 48:41.505
- Are you staying for dinner?
- No, I've got a lot of work to do.

48:41.579 --> 48:43.843
Ah, the bell.

48:46.350 --> 48:50.639
- Excuse me.
- Call me next week. I'll give you an estimate.

48:56.193 --> 48:58.457
Larry.
How have you been?

48:58.529 --> 49:00.588
- Fine. Traveling actually.
- Yes.

49:00.664 --> 49:02.586
- Can I get you a drink?
- Nothing, thank you.

49:02.666 --> 49:06.796
Larry! Excuse me. <i>Sir</i> Larry.

49:06.871 --> 49:10.227
How are you?
Goddamn, you look great.

49:10.307 --> 49:13.435
- Gordon.
- So you wanna talk?

49:13.511 --> 49:17.538
- I guess I'll be heading back now, Mr. Gekko.
- Stick around.

49:17.615 --> 49:20.846
This is one of my gang, Bud Fox.

49:22.553 --> 49:25.852
- Should we go upstairs?
- Yeah.

49:36.600 --> 49:41.560
The rarest pistol in the world, Larry-
a .45 Luger.

49:41.639 --> 49:45.803
Only six of them were ever manufactured.

49:45.876 --> 49:48.800
Congratulations.

49:48.879 --> 49:51.973
But rarer still is your interest 
in Anacott Steel.

49:52.049 --> 49:55.041
My interest is the same as yours, Larry- money.

49:55.119 --> 49:57.713
I thought it'd be a good investment for my kid.

49:57.788 --> 50:00.916
No, this time, I'm in for the long term.
It's not a liquidation.

50:00.991 --> 50:06.019
I'm gonna turn it around.
You're getting a free ride on my tail, mate.

50:06.097 --> 50:08.520
And with the dollars you're costing me
to buy back the stock...

50:08.599 --> 50:11.090
I could modernize the plant.

50:11.168 --> 50:14.296
I'm not the only one who pays here, Gordon.

50:14.371 --> 50:18.467
We're talking about lives and jobs,
three and four generations of steelworkers.

50:18.542 --> 50:21.773
Correct me if I'm wrong,
but when you acquired C.N.X. Electronics...

50:21.846 --> 50:24.804
you laid off, what, 6,000 workers.

50:24.882 --> 50:28.443
Jemson Fruit- 4,000.
That airline you bought, um-

50:28.519 --> 50:33.047
I could break you, mate,
in two pieces over my knees.

50:33.124 --> 50:35.285
You know it, I know it.

50:35.359 --> 50:38.089
I could buy you six times over.

50:38.162 --> 50:40.722
I could dump the stock
just to burn your ass!

50:40.798 --> 50:43.062
But I happen to want the company...

50:43.134 --> 50:46.763
and I want your block of shares.

50:46.837 --> 50:50.227
I'm announcing a tender offer at 65 tomorrow.

50:50.307 --> 50:53.198
I'm expecting your commitment.

50:54.278 --> 50:57.338
Showdowns bore me, Larry. 
Nobody wins.

50:57.414 --> 51:01.145
You can have the company.
In fact, it's gonna be fun...

51:01.218 --> 51:05.848
watching you and your giant ego
try to make a horse race of it.

51:05.923 --> 51:09.017
Buddy, what's a fair price for that stock?

51:09.093 --> 51:12.290
The breakup value is higher.
It's worth 80.

51:12.363 --> 51:14.923
Well, we don't want to be greedy.

51:14.999 --> 51:17.388
So what do you say to 72?

51:19.803 --> 51:25.298
You're a two-bit pirate and greenmailer,
nothing more, Gekko.

51:27.378 --> 51:31.735
Not only would you sell your mother 
to make a deal, you'd send her C.O.D.

51:31.815 --> 51:35.979
My mail is the same color as yours is, pal.

51:36.053 --> 51:41.184
Or at least it was until the queen
started to call you "sir."

51:41.258 --> 51:43.749
Now, you'll excuse me 
before I lose my temper.

51:43.794 --> 51:45.785
Seventy-one.

51:52.703 --> 51:57.561
Well, now, considering you brought
my mother into it, 71.50.

52:01.579 --> 52:03.044
Done.

52:04.915 --> 52:07.873
You'll hear from my lawyers tomorrow, 
8:00 a.m. Good night.

52:14.792 --> 52:16.714
You know, he's right.
I had to sell.

52:16.794 --> 52:18.716
The key to the game 
is your capital reserves.

52:18.796 --> 52:22.618
You don't have enough, you can't piss 
in the tall weeds with the big dogs.

52:22.700 --> 52:24.622
"All warfare's based on deception."

52:24.702 --> 52:26.932
Sun Tzu.

52:27.004 --> 52:30.201
"If your enemy is superior, evade him.

52:30.274 --> 52:32.765
"If angry, irritate him.

52:32.843 --> 52:35.334
"If equally matched, fight.

52:35.379 --> 52:38.041
And if not, split and reevaluate."

52:38.115 --> 52:41.505
Hey, he's learning, huh?
Buddy's learning.

52:52.997 --> 52:56.296
- Yeah.
- <i>Money never sleeps, pal.</i> 

52:56.367 --> 52:59.825
<i>Just made 800,000 in Hong Kong gold.
It's been wired to you.</i>

52:59.903 --> 53:02.736
Play with it.
You done good...

53:02.806 --> 53:05.468
but you gotta keep doing good. 

53:05.542 --> 53:08.670
I showed you how the game works.
Now school's out.

53:08.746 --> 53:12.011
Mr. Gekko, I'm there for you 110%.

53:12.082 --> 53:16.576
<i>No, no, no, no. You don't understand.
I wanna be surprised.</i>

53:18.055 --> 53:19.977
Astonish me, pal.
New info.

53:20.057 --> 53:25.188
I don't care where or how you get it.
Just get it.

53:27.498 --> 53:31.958
My, uh, wife tells me
you made a move on Darien.

53:32.036 --> 53:34.061
Well, here's some inside info for you.

53:34.138 --> 53:37.562
That Euro-flash <i>G.Q.</i> type
she's going out with has got big bucks...

53:37.641 --> 53:40.474
but he's putting her feet to sleep.

53:40.544 --> 53:43.138
Exit visas are imminent.

53:43.213 --> 53:46.207
So I don't want you
losing your place in line.

53:48.285 --> 53:53.382
Ah, Jesus.
I wish you could see this.

53:53.457 --> 53:55.823
Light's coming up.

53:59.530 --> 54:03.796
I've never seen a painting
that captures the beauty of the ocean...

54:03.867 --> 54:06.597
at a moment like this.

54:07.838 --> 54:11.262
<i>I'm gonna make you rich, Bud Fox.</i>

54:11.342 --> 54:15.438
<i>Yeah, rich enough
you can afford a girl like Darien.</i>

54:15.512 --> 54:19.369
This is your wake-up call, pal.

54:19.450 --> 54:21.441
Go to work.

54:36.900 --> 54:39.323
- Fox.
- Mr. Barnes.

54:40.971 --> 54:44.668
Buddy, is this <i>deja vu?</i>
What's it been, a year, a year and a half?

54:44.742 --> 54:48.200
So, I hear you're moving up in the world.

54:48.278 --> 54:51.839
Senior associate. Not bad. Not bad. 
How's Margie?

54:51.915 --> 54:55.874
Can't complain.
We got a house in Oyster Bay, you know.

54:55.953 --> 55:00.151
Market treating you good?
Still seeing that sexy French chick?

55:00.224 --> 55:02.988
No, no.
She asked the wrong question.

55:03.060 --> 55:04.982
- What was that?
- "What are you thinking?"

55:08.766 --> 55:11.257
The hours are hell...

55:11.335 --> 55:14.133
but the cash is starting to tumble in.

55:14.204 --> 55:16.627
I know this guy who has
an ironclad way of making money.

55:16.707 --> 55:18.937
- I can't lose and I can't get hurt.
- Can't get hurt?

55:19.009 --> 55:23.708
Well, so does this guy
have a tip for an honest lawyer?

55:23.781 --> 55:26.113
Maybe.

55:26.183 --> 55:30.040
Check out Teldar Paper.
But don't quote me.

55:30.120 --> 55:32.645
What about you?

55:32.723 --> 55:34.748
I hear you guys are handling
the Fairchild Foods merger...

55:34.825 --> 55:37.123
and it may not be going through.

55:37.194 --> 55:40.686
Any surprises I haven't read about
in <i>The Wall Street Journal?</i>

55:40.764 --> 55:43.619
Come on, Buddy. That's illegal.
You wouldn't wanna get me disbarred, would you?

55:43.700 --> 55:46.191
Well, who's listening?

55:46.236 --> 55:49.125
Just one college buddy talking to another.

55:49.206 --> 55:51.128
Yeah, right.

55:51.208 --> 55:56.464
Oh, relax, Roger.
Everybody's doing it.

55:56.547 --> 56:00.540
But if you don't know,
then you don't know.

56:05.923 --> 56:10.519
And if I did,
what's in it for <i>moi?</i>

56:12.029 --> 56:15.658
More money than you ever dreamed of.

56:15.732 --> 56:19.293
Nobody gets hurt.

56:19.369 --> 56:22.668
You think about it.

56:22.739 --> 56:24.661
Let's grab a beer.
What do you say?

56:24.741 --> 56:28.268
Uh, no. Too much to do.
I- But I'll walk you out. 

56:30.481 --> 56:32.711
File's on the desk, Marie.

56:32.783 --> 56:36.048
Get inside my uncle's door, Bud,
all the secrets of the world are yours.

56:36.119 --> 56:41.512
The lifeblood of companies. Of course,
you've gotta go to law school first, but- 

56:58.842 --> 57:02.039
Mr. Panos, I've been charting the growth 
of new office space in the city...

57:02.112 --> 57:04.945
and I happen to think you're in 
the right business at the right time.

57:05.015 --> 57:07.074
Thank you for telling me
what I already know.

57:07.150 --> 57:10.176
Look, I'm very impressed with your work
in this growing business.

57:10.254 --> 57:12.415
I can use a tax break.
Let me ask you something.

57:12.489 --> 57:14.719
What would you say to some
working capital and a partner?

57:14.791 --> 57:18.522
- What makes you think I need a partner?
- Look, you got five vans.

57:18.595 --> 57:21.587
You need eight. 42 employees can't possibly
cover the amount of buildings you already got...

57:21.665 --> 57:24.156
not to mention the clients
you and I could have together.

57:24.234 --> 57:28.762
I'm an expert at identifying
undervalued assets such as this business.

58:18.088 --> 58:20.886
Well, the good news, Gordon,
is Roarker Electronics.

58:20.958 --> 58:24.223
That's right. I see it happening
sometime in the next couple of months.

58:24.294 --> 58:27.058
You gotta be kidding!
Their quarterlies are for shit.

58:27.130 --> 58:30.987
I've got a little gift for you.

58:31.068 --> 58:34.629
Gordon will be very pleased.
What else have you got?

58:39.276 --> 58:43.565
You know Marty Windman?
He netted 650 "G" off that merger. 

58:43.647 --> 58:46.013
- Twenty-six years old. The guy's Rambo.
- The guy's an asshole.

58:46.083 --> 58:50.406
The guy is Rambo. He's got himself
a Porsche Turbo Cabriolet, about 75 thou.

58:50.487 --> 58:55.311
I think that if I can make a bundle of cash
before I'm 30 and get out of this racket...

58:55.392 --> 58:59.453
I'll be able to ride my motorcycle 
across China.

58:59.529 --> 59:03.590
I'd like to do for furniture
what Laura Ashley did for interior fabrics-

59:03.667 --> 59:06.795
produce a line of high-quality antiques 
at a low price.

59:06.870 --> 59:10.692
- Sounds great. I'll take you public.
- You will?

59:35.065 --> 59:37.431
Can I help you?

59:38.869 --> 59:41.429
Oh, excuse me.
Is this Bill Bates' office?

59:41.505 --> 59:45.066
- No.
- I'm sorry.

59:55.052 --> 59:58.579
- Hiya, Dad.
- What brings you out here?

59:58.655 --> 01:00:00.953
A client and a private jet over at Butler.

01:00:01.024 --> 01:00:02.946
- Hey, Buddy, how you doing?
- Mr. Wall Street.

01:00:03.026 --> 01:00:05.586
Hey. It's the bozos
that keep us in the air.

01:00:05.662 --> 01:00:08.688
- Give us a hand.
- We'll show you how to do an honest day's work.

01:00:08.765 --> 01:00:11.654
All right. Change the oil,
fill the tires and park it out back.

01:00:11.735 --> 01:00:14.067
- This kid want to buy the plane?
- Mind this guy.

01:00:14.137 --> 01:00:17.527
- How come you always gotta light up when you see me? 
- Hey, don't start with me, all right?

01:00:17.607 --> 01:00:19.734
All right.

01:00:19.810 --> 01:00:22.404
Who peed in your Cheerios?

01:00:22.479 --> 01:00:24.845
Goddamn fare wars are killing us.

01:00:24.915 --> 01:00:27.110
Management's gonna lay off
five of my men this week.

01:00:27.184 --> 01:00:29.948
- There's nothing I can do about it.
- I'm sorry about that.

01:00:30.020 --> 01:00:32.011
So, what's with you?
How much you need?

01:00:32.089 --> 01:00:34.353
I don't need anything.
I'm doing great.

01:00:34.424 --> 01:00:37.587
New client, whole new ball game.
Things are really starting to happen.

01:00:37.661 --> 01:00:40.494
Yeah, sure.
Lots of guys at the track talk like that.

01:00:40.564 --> 01:00:42.589
How do you know
you'll have any dough next month?

01:00:42.666 --> 01:00:45.464
Jesus Christ! What is this?
I only gave you a few hundred.

01:00:45.535 --> 01:00:47.457
It's dividend.

01:00:47.537 --> 01:00:50.597
I figured I'd borrowed at least five grand
in pocket change over the years.

01:00:50.674 --> 01:00:54.064
Oh, stop it. Come on.
Put this toward your school loan.

01:00:54.144 --> 01:00:56.999
Oh, forget the loans.
Look, Dad, things are good...

01:00:57.080 --> 01:00:59.002
and it's gonna stay that way.

01:00:59.082 --> 01:01:01.880
- Buy yourself a new suit.
- What do I need a new suit for?

01:01:01.952 --> 01:01:05.217
I don't hobnob with the jet set.
I just fix their planes.

01:01:05.288 --> 01:01:07.518
Well, then get yourself
a decent bowling jacket...

01:01:07.591 --> 01:01:10.651
so when you take Mom out
you don't look like the Roto-Rooter man.

01:01:10.727 --> 01:01:12.957
Come on, Dad.
What's money for? Enjoy yourself.

01:01:13.029 --> 01:01:16.385
Money is one giant pain in the ass,
if you ask me. But thanks, kid.

01:01:16.466 --> 01:01:18.957
- How about dinner?
- Yeah, sure. Any night this week.

01:01:19.035 --> 01:01:21.196
Okay- No, I'm sorry, this week's booked.

01:01:21.271 --> 01:01:23.637
I'll check with my girl.
I'll get back to you.

01:01:23.707 --> 01:01:26.369
Yeah, you do that, Huckle Berry.
You know where to find me.

01:01:26.443 --> 01:01:30.732
I gotta run, Dad. 
You stop smoking, you hear? I'll talk at you.

01:01:33.483 --> 01:01:35.405
Oh! Oh, oh, oh!

01:01:45.127 --> 01:01:49.588
It's in both our interests to put
a safe distance between you and us.

01:01:49.666 --> 01:01:52.965
- Now, you understand that, Mr. Fox?
- Sure.

01:01:53.036 --> 01:01:56.335
This gives you limited power of attorney
for Mr. Gekko's account.

01:01:56.406 --> 01:01:58.397
Every trade you make 
is at your discretion.

01:01:58.475 --> 01:02:00.864
Every ticket you buy must be marked 
"power of attorney."

01:02:00.944 --> 01:02:02.866
That means that you call the shots.

01:02:02.946 --> 01:02:07.269
Mr. Gekko has absolutely no official knowledge 
of what stocks you're buying.

01:02:07.350 --> 01:02:09.682
All right?
Just sign it at the end twice.

01:02:11.755 --> 01:02:15.088
I never knew how poor I was
till I started making a little money.

01:02:15.158 --> 01:02:18.047
Your transactions will be monitored
by Stock Watch.

01:02:18.128 --> 01:02:21.757
If any trouble does arise,
you are on your own out there.

01:02:21.832 --> 01:02:24.255
The trail does stop with you.
You understand?

01:02:24.334 --> 01:02:27.565
Spread the buy orders over different accounts, 
you won't get burnt.

01:02:27.637 --> 01:02:31.664
I think I have some friends 
that won't mind making some easy money.

01:02:31.741 --> 01:02:34.073
- Daddy.
- Rudy Kazootee!

01:02:34.144 --> 01:02:38.569
<i>How's my cutie?</i> Viens ici.
<i>Oh, yeah!</i>

01:02:38.648 --> 01:02:41.412
Yeah! Yeah!

01:02:41.484 --> 01:02:44.749
- <i>Bonjour, monsieur</i> Buddy.
- <i>Bonjour, monsieur</i> Buddy.

01:02:44.821 --> 01:02:48.052
Oh, he speaks French already.

01:02:48.124 --> 01:02:50.456
Kid had the highest score on his I.Q. test.

01:02:50.527 --> 01:02:53.087
It is so difficult to get
into a good nursery school now.

01:02:53.163 --> 01:02:56.587
You gotta buy Teldar with a third party.

01:02:56.666 --> 01:03:00.488
They visit your home
just to make sure you're acceptable.

01:03:00.570 --> 01:03:03.266
That's it for you with the grown-ups,
young man.

01:03:03.340 --> 01:03:06.138
Nicole, would you take him
for a nap now, please.

01:03:06.209 --> 01:03:09.872
Give him a bath,
and put that cute black suit on him.

01:03:09.946 --> 01:03:14.110
This is a contact at one 
of our offshore banks.

01:03:14.184 --> 01:03:17.017
On settlement day, you'll open
an account there for Mr. Gekko...

01:03:17.087 --> 01:03:19.476
under the name Geneva, Roth Holding Corp.

01:03:20.228 --> 01:03:24.426
Then you'll wire transfer the money
to this account in the Cayman Islands.

01:03:24.499 --> 01:03:27.354
You're gonna make a lot of money, pal.

01:03:28.836 --> 01:03:31.758
The stakes are going up.
No mistakes.

01:03:33.508 --> 01:03:35.499
Piece of cake, Gordon.

01:03:51.059 --> 01:03:55.257
If I could have anything,
this would almost do.

01:03:56.464 --> 01:03:59.422
Almost.

01:03:59.500 --> 01:04:02.298
So how'd your conference go with Gordon?

01:04:02.370 --> 01:04:04.668
It went fine.
Reached an agreement.

01:04:04.739 --> 01:04:07.367
We decided to split up the world between us.

01:04:07.442 --> 01:04:10.434
You have modest wants.

01:04:10.511 --> 01:04:12.433
I like that in a man.

01:04:12.513 --> 01:04:14.469
What do you want?

01:04:14.549 --> 01:04:17.814
Let's see.
A Turner...

01:04:17.885 --> 01:04:20.649
a perfect Canary diamond...

01:04:20.722 --> 01:04:24.214
world peace, the best of everything.

01:04:24.292 --> 01:04:27.056
- Oh, why stop at that?
- I don't.

01:04:43.745 --> 01:04:48.273
My client wants to buy a large, large block of Teldar. 
And he needs to spread it around.

01:04:48.349 --> 01:04:51.910
I'll park some money in your account.
If it hits, you get a big cut.

01:04:51.986 --> 01:04:56.252
<i>I'm telling you, this is
the easiest money you've ever made.</i>

01:04:56.324 --> 01:04:59.487
All right, Bud.
Let's do it.

01:05:01.095 --> 01:05:02.926
We go way back, Harry.

01:05:02.997 --> 01:05:06.956
You know, I- I've put a lot of money
into this firm over the years...

01:05:07.035 --> 01:05:08.957
and I've brought in a lot of business.

01:05:09.037 --> 01:05:10.959
You've taken enough out too.
You know that.

01:05:11.039 --> 01:05:13.234
- You should have something put aside.
- Well, I don't.

01:05:13.307 --> 01:05:16.435
With the divorces and everything,
I haven't had a chance. And the kids-

01:05:16.511 --> 01:05:19.674
- The bridges are burned.
- When you fire me, I'm finished, Harry...

01:05:19.747 --> 01:05:22.636
- finished on the street.
- How do you think I feel about this?

01:05:22.717 --> 01:05:27.609
How do you think I feel?
I've got a lot of responsibilities.

01:05:27.689 --> 01:05:31.580
- What's going on?
- Lynch is giving him the boot.

01:05:31.659 --> 01:05:33.015
He's not pulling his quota.

01:05:35.096 --> 01:05:37.428
We're all just one trade away
from humility, Bud.

01:05:37.498 --> 01:05:40.387
<i>Research report on G.M.
and a conference call on defense stock...</i>

01:05:40.468 --> 01:05:42.390
<i>in my office, 7:00 a.m. tomorrow.</i>

01:05:42.470 --> 01:05:44.893
<i>No R.S. V.P. required.
Just be there!</i>

01:05:44.972 --> 01:05:49.671
<i>Now, on a more inspiring note, 
I am pleased to announce the new office record...</i>

01:05:49.744 --> 01:05:51.735
for a single month's gross commission...

01:05:51.813 --> 01:05:56.307
from the wealthy individual accounts
goes to Bud Fox.

01:05:56.384 --> 01:06:00.809
<i>Shows cold-calling does work, fellas.
Way to go, Bud. Super job!</i>

01:06:00.888 --> 01:06:03.982
- <i>Come on up here.</i>
- Bud, congrats.

01:06:04.058 --> 01:06:06.652
You just made my life
twice as hard around here.

01:06:10.732 --> 01:06:12.654
You're on a roll, kid.

01:06:12.734 --> 01:06:16.465
Enjoy it while it lasts,
'cause it never does.

01:06:16.537 --> 01:06:19.426
Just kicking ass and taking names, Lou.

01:06:33.888 --> 01:06:36.152
Come along with me, Bud.

01:06:41.596 --> 01:06:43.518
This is yours now, Bud.

01:06:43.598 --> 01:06:46.158
Credenza, tree, windows...

01:06:46.234 --> 01:06:50.591
and significantly more attractive,
your private secretary Janet.

01:06:50.671 --> 01:06:54.198
- Nice to meet you, Mr. Fox.
- Hello, Janet.

01:06:54.275 --> 01:06:56.664
Well, I don't really know
what to say.

01:06:56.744 --> 01:07:00.202
- Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Lynch.
- No, I thank you, Bud.

01:07:00.281 --> 01:07:04.411
The minute I laid my eyes on you,
I knew that you had what it takes.

01:07:04.485 --> 01:07:07.909
Now you can focus
on the big-ticket retail.

01:07:07.989 --> 01:07:09.911
Oh, this is very nice.

01:07:09.991 --> 01:07:11.913
This is very nice.

01:07:11.993 --> 01:07:14.848
So, what's it, Mr. Cocksucker now?

01:07:16.562 --> 01:07:18.554
Everybody tells you they hate 
the Upper East Side.

01:07:18.633 --> 01:07:20.555
They wanna live on the West Side.

01:07:20.635 --> 01:07:24.992
But believe me, when it's resale time,
the East Side moves all the time.

01:07:25.072 --> 01:07:28.735
What do you got on the West Side?
Sean and Madonna? Trust me.

01:07:28.810 --> 01:07:33.770
Massage, sauna, jacuzzi, tanning salon...

01:07:35.383 --> 01:07:37.749
best schools in the city.

01:07:37.819 --> 01:07:40.083
You know, a cute young boy like you...

01:07:40.154 --> 01:07:42.645
got to think of a future lady friend
in your life...

01:07:42.690 --> 01:07:45.523
when you're finished wolfing around.

01:07:45.593 --> 01:07:49.757
Of course, I'm taken.
Oak-stripped floors.

01:07:49.831 --> 01:07:51.856
My husband could get you a 10% mortgage.

01:07:51.933 --> 01:07:56.097
I would do it myself, except
I'm into four other deals right now.

01:07:56.170 --> 01:07:58.126
So, I got a 4:00 and a 5:00.

01:07:58.206 --> 01:08:02.768
One of them's an all-cash type,
Monique something or other.

01:08:02.844 --> 01:08:07.076
Look, maybe you'd like to see something cheaper 
I got over on First Avenue.

01:08:07.148 --> 01:08:11.107
Honey, the meter's running.
Anybody home?

01:08:12.820 --> 01:08:15.584
All right, offer 950.

01:08:17.591 --> 01:08:20.857
You know, I got something over 
on Sutton Place.

01:08:20.928 --> 01:08:24.625
It's a million and a half,
but now we're talking duplex.

01:08:24.698 --> 01:08:26.621
No.

01:08:26.701 --> 01:08:30.990
This is it.
This is home.

01:08:58.399 --> 01:09:01.459
That's enough gold.
That's enough gold over there.

01:09:22.057 --> 01:09:24.149
You like it?

01:09:26.227 --> 01:09:29.151
I'm having <i>House & Garden</i>
come up next week to photograph it...

01:09:29.229 --> 01:09:31.152
before it gets lived in.

01:09:31.232 --> 01:09:33.154
Do you mind?

01:09:34.234 --> 01:09:37.330
Hey, Gary, what do you got?

01:09:37.404 --> 01:09:40.135
No, no- 37 and a half.

01:09:40.207 --> 01:09:45.064
Convert the bonds and check the price
from Tokyo at 8:00 your time. Right.

01:09:55.724 --> 01:09:57.246
Mmm.

01:10:00.328 --> 01:10:02.592
Damn.

01:10:07.635 --> 01:10:09.728
I'm spilling everything.

01:10:41.335 --> 01:10:44.031
Isn't it perfect?

01:10:44.105 --> 01:10:46.494
It's too perfect.

01:10:46.574 --> 01:10:48.496
Let's not even eat.

01:10:48.576 --> 01:10:51.704
Let's just watch it, think about it.

01:11:38.959 --> 01:11:40.950
Who am I?

01:11:51.305 --> 01:11:53.296
Bud, come to bed.

01:11:58.212 --> 01:12:01.568
One million, six.
1,700,000 on my left now.

01:12:01.649 --> 01:12:03.810
Against you, 1,800,000.

01:12:03.884 --> 01:12:06.512
1,900,000.
New bidder this side.

01:12:06.587 --> 01:12:08.646
One million, nine.
Two million dollars here now.

01:12:08.722 --> 01:12:10.644
Not yours.
At 2,100,000.

01:12:10.724 --> 01:12:15.115
2,100,000. Fair warning then.
Selling for $2,100,000.

01:12:15.196 --> 01:12:18.495
All done. For you, sir.
2,100,000.

01:12:18.566 --> 01:12:21.660
What do you say we get a suite
at the Carlyle?

01:12:21.735 --> 01:12:26.001
Champagne, caviar,
celebrate just like old times.

01:12:26.073 --> 01:12:28.769
Come on, Gordon.
Those days are over.

01:12:28.843 --> 01:12:32.006
Well, you can't blame me for trying.

01:12:32.079 --> 01:12:36.175
You're as beautiful as that painting
I just bought.

01:12:36.250 --> 01:12:38.582
Sunshine, what's wrong?

01:12:38.652 --> 01:12:41.143
Looks like you got a bad case of puppy love.

01:12:41.188 --> 01:12:43.748
I think I'm falling for Bud.

01:12:43.824 --> 01:12:47.988
Don't fall too far. 
He hasn't been around the block yet. You have.

01:12:49.163 --> 01:12:52.087
- You told him about us?
- No. Are you crazy?

01:12:52.166 --> 01:12:55.590
I don't want him to ever know.
Do you understand?

01:12:55.669 --> 01:12:57.591
Mum's the word.

01:12:59.740 --> 01:13:01.901
You and I are the same, Darien.

01:13:01.976 --> 01:13:06.800
We are smart enough not to buy
into the oldest myth running- love.

01:13:06.881 --> 01:13:11.306
A fiction created by people to keep them
from jumping out of windows.

01:13:11.385 --> 01:13:14.115
You know, sometimes I miss you, Gordon.

01:13:14.188 --> 01:13:16.179
You're really twisted.

01:13:18.959 --> 01:13:21.086
Oh, for Christ's sake, Jack, it's easy.

01:13:21.162 --> 01:13:23.357
On settlement day, you endorse a check...

01:13:23.430 --> 01:13:28.458
to Blue Horseshoe Trading Company,
and then I'll send you your cut.

01:13:28.536 --> 01:13:32.563
What? No, that's the bottom line.
Nobody gets hurt.

01:13:32.640 --> 01:13:34.699
What the fuck is wrong with you?

01:13:34.775 --> 01:13:38.541
Things are so bad around here, even the lions
are complaining. But not with you. No-o-o.

01:13:38.612 --> 01:13:41.945
- You're making big money. What's the bottom line? 
- Hey, look!

01:13:42.016 --> 01:13:45.975
I am sick and tired of playing
wet nurse to you all the time!

01:13:46.053 --> 01:13:48.317
Will you do your own homework, Marv?

01:13:48.389 --> 01:13:51.745
What an asshole, man!

01:13:51.825 --> 01:13:53.816
That's a shame.

01:13:56.697 --> 01:14:00.258
Frank, work 500,000 shares Teldar 
with a limit of 26.

01:14:00.334 --> 01:14:03.565
New account.
Don't fuck it up.

01:14:05.072 --> 01:14:07.563
- How's Teldar doing?
- You back again?

01:14:07.641 --> 01:14:10.371
- The guy's got a real appetite.
- Make it five to a half.

01:14:10.444 --> 01:14:12.742
- About a couple of thousand up.
- I gotta buy some stock.  

01:14:12.813 --> 01:14:15.236
- What do you offer at a half?
- What are we looking at?

01:14:15.316 --> 01:14:17.238
- Excuse me. Excuse me.
- Make me an offer.

01:14:17.318 --> 01:14:19.183
- 80,000 at a half.
- I'll take it.

01:14:19.253 --> 01:14:24.077
80,000 trades at a half. Put it on the tape,
a couple of thousand up.

01:14:36.370 --> 01:14:39.168
Mark, I think I got something here.

01:14:46.146 --> 01:14:49.968
Your company, ladies and gentlemen,
is under siege from Gordon Gekko!

01:14:50.050 --> 01:14:52.575
Teldar Paper is now leveraged to the hilt...

01:14:52.653 --> 01:14:55.611
like some piss-poor South American country.

01:14:55.689 --> 01:14:57.680
I strongly recommend you...

01:14:57.758 --> 01:15:01.114
to see through Mr. Gekko's
shameless intention here...

01:15:01.195 --> 01:15:06.087
to strip this company
and severely penalize the stockholders.

01:15:06.166 --> 01:15:09.522
I strongly recommend you
to reject his tender...

01:15:09.603 --> 01:15:13.733
by voting for management's restructuring 
of the stock.

01:15:13.807 --> 01:15:15.729
My thanks.

01:15:23.884 --> 01:15:27.547
Well, I, uh- I appreciate the opportunity
you're giving me, Mr. Cromwell...

01:15:27.621 --> 01:15:32.854
as the single largest shareholder
in Teldar Paper to speak.

01:15:32.926 --> 01:15:34.848
Well, ladies and gentlemen...

01:15:34.928 --> 01:15:36.850
we're not here to indulge in fantasy...

01:15:36.930 --> 01:15:41.219
but in political and economic reality.

01:15:41.302 --> 01:15:43.566
America-

01:15:43.637 --> 01:15:48.131
America has become a second-rate power.

01:15:48.208 --> 01:15:51.598
Its trade deficit and its fiscal deficit...

01:15:51.679 --> 01:15:53.772
are at nightmare proportions.

01:15:53.847 --> 01:15:56.873
Now, in the days of the free market...

01:15:56.950 --> 01:15:59.441
when our country was a top industrial power...

01:15:59.486 --> 01:16:02.910
there was accountability to the stockholder.

01:16:02.990 --> 01:16:08.018
The Carnegies, the Mellons, 
the men that built this great industrial empire...

01:16:08.095 --> 01:16:11.792
made sure of it because
it was their money at stake.

01:16:11.865 --> 01:16:17.189
Today, management 
has no stake in the company!

01:16:17.271 --> 01:16:19.637
Altogether, these men sitting up here...

01:16:19.707 --> 01:16:21.732
own less than three percent of the company.

01:16:21.809 --> 01:16:26.473
Where does Mr. Cromwell put
his million-dollar salary?

01:16:26.547 --> 01:16:30.142
Not in Teldar stock.
He owns less than one percent.

01:16:30.217 --> 01:16:34.483
You own the company.
That's right. You, the stockholder.

01:16:34.555 --> 01:16:39.049
And you are all being royally screwed over 
by these bureaucrats...

01:16:39.126 --> 01:16:41.754
with their steak luncheons,
their hunting and fishing trips...

01:16:41.829 --> 01:16:44.992
their corporate jets and golden parachutes.

01:16:45.065 --> 01:16:47.693
This is an outrage!
You're out of line, Gekko!

01:16:47.768 --> 01:16:49.963
Teldar Paper, Mr. Cromwell-

01:16:50.037 --> 01:16:53.768
Teldar Paper has 33 different vice presidents...

01:16:53.841 --> 01:16:57.629
each earning over $200,000 a year.

01:16:59.713 --> 01:17:02.045
Now I've spent the last two months...

01:17:02.116 --> 01:17:05.677
analyzing what all these guys do.

01:17:05.753 --> 01:17:08.608
And I still can't figure it out.

01:17:08.689 --> 01:17:14.355
One thing I do know is that 
our paper company lost $110 million last year.

01:17:14.428 --> 01:17:17.488
I'll bet half of that was spent
in all the paperwork...

01:17:17.564 --> 01:17:20.419
going back and forth
between all these vice presidents.

01:17:20.501 --> 01:17:26.030
The new law of evolution in corporate America...

01:17:26.106 --> 01:17:31.100
seems to be survival of the unfittest.

01:17:31.178 --> 01:17:35.535
Well, in my book, you either do it right, 
or you get eliminated.

01:17:37.951 --> 01:17:40.374
In the last seven deals
that I have been involved with...

01:17:40.454 --> 01:17:43.218
there were 2.5 million stockholders...

01:17:43.290 --> 01:17:47.454
who have made a pretax profit
of $12 billion.

01:17:47.528 --> 01:17:50.292
Thank you.

01:17:52.399 --> 01:17:55.630
I am not a destroyer of companies.

01:17:55.702 --> 01:17:58.068
I am a liberator of them!

01:18:00.641 --> 01:18:03.166
The point is, ladies and gentlemen...

01:18:03.243 --> 01:18:06.804
that greed- 
for lack of a better word-

01:18:06.880 --> 01:18:08.802
is good.

01:18:08.882 --> 01:18:12.215
Greed is right.
Greed works.

01:18:12.286 --> 01:18:15.414
Greed clarifies, cuts through...

01:18:15.489 --> 01:18:18.083
and captures the essence...

01:18:18.158 --> 01:18:20.114
of the evolutionary spirit.

01:18:20.194 --> 01:18:22.617
Greed, in all of its forms-

01:18:22.696 --> 01:18:27.087
greed for life, for money,
for love, knowledge-

01:18:27.167 --> 01:18:29.658
has marked the upward surge of mankind.

01:18:29.736 --> 01:18:34.264
And greed-
you mark my words-

01:18:34.341 --> 01:18:36.536
will not only save Teldar Paper...

01:18:36.610 --> 01:18:40.569
but that other malfunctioning corporation
called the U.S.A.

01:18:40.647 --> 01:18:43.445
Thank you very much.

01:18:50.257 --> 01:18:53.283
Great! Great!

01:18:53.360 --> 01:18:56.249
Thank you.

01:18:56.330 --> 01:18:58.252
Thank you!

01:18:58.332 --> 01:19:01.756
Buy me 20 June Eurodollar CDs,
20 March Gold...

01:19:01.835 --> 01:19:04.497
and sell 10 September deutsche marks.

01:19:04.571 --> 01:19:07.404
Right.
Talk at you, babe.

01:19:07.474 --> 01:19:09.465
Buddy! Buddy!

01:19:09.543 --> 01:19:13.138
I hate to tell you this,
but you are a genius.

01:19:13.213 --> 01:19:15.579
Darien, lightning has struck.

01:19:15.649 --> 01:19:19.574
The light bulb has been invented.
Bluestar Airlines.

01:19:19.653 --> 01:19:22.816
Edison, da Vinci, Einstein,
they're all watching me.

01:19:22.890 --> 01:19:24.846
You ever hear of the 60-hour work week?

01:19:24.925 --> 01:19:26.916
You've gotta go to work 
in a couple of hours...

01:19:26.994 --> 01:19:29.053
and I'm getting psychotic
from a lack of REM sleep.

01:19:29.129 --> 01:19:31.791
You think I'm gonna broker the rest of my life? 
Come on, Darien.

01:19:31.865 --> 01:19:34.060
I am gonna be a giant,
an entrepreneur...

01:19:34.134 --> 01:19:36.796
in the Italian 16th century
sense of the word.

01:19:36.870 --> 01:19:40.567
A mover. A shaker.
I'm shooting for the stars, Darien.

01:19:40.641 --> 01:19:43.371
You're coming along for the ride.

01:19:45.946 --> 01:19:49.040
Bluestar's an unpolished gem, Gordon,
right out of the garbage.

01:19:49.116 --> 01:19:53.075
A half-assed management being decimated 
by a price war they cannot win.

01:19:53.153 --> 01:19:56.816
But the gates at <i>La Guardia</i> alone 
can bail us out.

01:19:56.890 --> 01:20:00.018
If it's worth a dime, it's worth 10 bucks a share. 
They're ripe to fall.

01:20:00.093 --> 01:20:02.891
Mixed emotions, Buddy...

01:20:02.963 --> 01:20:07.889
like Larry Wildman going of a cliff
in my new Maserati.

01:20:09.636 --> 01:20:13.458
Guys like me have had their asses hung 
in a sling with the airlines.

01:20:13.540 --> 01:20:15.462
Fuel could go up, unions are killers.

01:20:15.542 --> 01:20:19.330
Yeah, yeah. But aren't you forgetting one thing? 
Capital reserves.

01:20:19.413 --> 01:20:23.304
This company has $75 million cash
in an overfunded pension.

01:20:23.383 --> 01:20:25.613
That buys us a lot of credibility.

01:20:25.686 --> 01:20:29.178
And the beauty is you already own
close to two percent of this sucker.

01:20:29.256 --> 01:20:32.316
Gordon, the insurance people 
are balking on the logging trucks.

01:20:32.392 --> 01:20:34.314
What do you want to do?

01:20:34.394 --> 01:20:37.352
You tell those spineless assholes 
we'll self-insure if they don't write it.

01:20:37.431 --> 01:20:42.221
I can't believe it! You fire 
half the management and nothing changes!

01:20:45.138 --> 01:20:49.962
Gordon, what I want-
and I've never asked you for anything-

01:20:50.043 --> 01:20:53.206
is to be your copilot on this one.

01:20:53.280 --> 01:20:56.670
I want to take this airline,
turn it around, and make it work.

01:20:56.750 --> 01:20:59.844
It's gonna make us a fortune.

01:20:59.920 --> 01:21:02.775
I got a stock broker
that wants to run an airline.

01:21:02.856 --> 01:21:06.917
It's gonna take me two years and 2,000 headaches 
to turn Teldar Paper around.

01:21:06.994 --> 01:21:11.021
What the hell do I need a dink airline for?
I'm up to my ass in nuts.

01:21:11.098 --> 01:21:15.523
I've worked at Bluestar, Gordon. 
I know my way around. I have friends there inside.

01:21:15.602 --> 01:21:18.230
What do you mean?

01:21:18.305 --> 01:21:22.696
The three unions.
It's 43% of Bluestar's operating budget.

01:21:22.776 --> 01:21:25.336
The hourly cost of a flight crew 
is $850 an hour.

01:21:25.412 --> 01:21:27.710
That's the real hidden value, G.G. 

01:21:27.781 --> 01:21:32.275
If you can negotiate that out,
get a crew down to $350, $400 an hour...

01:21:32.352 --> 01:21:35.776
this airline is gonna be
the hottest thing since Texas Air.

01:21:35.856 --> 01:21:38.188
What makes you think you can?

01:21:38.258 --> 01:21:40.681
I can talk to these people, Gordon.
They trust me.

01:21:40.761 --> 01:21:44.788
My father could be a big help 
in getting cuts.

01:21:49.670 --> 01:21:52.730
All right. Susan, get Buckingham on the phone. 
Tell him to look into it.

01:21:54.975 --> 01:21:58.172
So the falcon's heard the falconer, huh?

01:22:12.292 --> 01:22:15.090
- Hi, Dad.
- Hello, son. Sorry I'm late.

01:22:15.162 --> 01:22:17.526
It's okay.
Overdressed as usual.

01:22:19.399 --> 01:22:21.321
Well, come on in.
Everybody's here.

01:22:21.401 --> 01:22:24.165
We couldn't start the show without you.

01:22:24.237 --> 01:22:27.400
Well, I'll be a lousy Republican.

01:22:27.474 --> 01:22:29.806
I decorate for Democrats too, 
lots of them.

01:22:29.876 --> 01:22:31.798
- I'm Darien Taylor.
- Oh, hi.

01:22:31.878 --> 01:22:34.506
- Bud's told me all about you.
- Well, don't believe a word he said.

01:22:34.581 --> 01:22:37.379
I never beat him
and I never locked him in a closet.

01:22:37.451 --> 01:22:40.147
- I forgot to tell you about the closet.
- I think he turned out okay.

01:22:40.220 --> 01:22:43.053
Bud's a born liar.
Otherwise, he's a good kid.

01:22:43.123 --> 01:22:47.014
I hope you come here more often
under less formal circumstances.

01:22:47.094 --> 01:22:50.188
- Thank you.
- Dad, I think you know Duncan Wilmore.

01:22:50.263 --> 01:22:52.561
Since before you were born.
How are you, Duncan?

01:22:52.632 --> 01:22:55.487
- Toni Carpenter, flight attendants.
- Carl, how are you?

01:22:55.569 --> 01:22:57.525
And I'd like you to meet Mr. Gekko.

01:22:57.604 --> 01:22:59.936
- Mr. Fox. Pleasure to meet you.
- Hi.

01:23:00.006 --> 01:23:01.962
His attorney, Mr. Saul.

01:23:02.042 --> 01:23:05.830
I'd be proud to have a son like Buddy.
He's got a hell of a career in front of him.

01:23:05.912 --> 01:23:08.506
I'm glad you think so.
I thought this was an informal gathering.

01:23:08.582 --> 01:23:10.675
What's your attorney doing here?

01:23:10.751 --> 01:23:14.141
Harold, you don't mind walking around the block 
a couple hundred times, do you?

01:23:14.221 --> 01:23:16.143
- Of course.
- Let me take that.

01:23:16.223 --> 01:23:18.145
- Thank you.
- No offense.

01:23:18.225 --> 01:23:20.216
None taken.

01:23:25.665 --> 01:23:29.487
That's okay, Gordon.
Bud does it all the time.

01:23:29.569 --> 01:23:32.595
Look, I got no illusions about winning...

01:23:32.672 --> 01:23:36.494
a popularity contest with any of you.

01:23:36.576 --> 01:23:38.498
I got roasted the other night.

01:23:38.578 --> 01:23:41.138
A friend of mine asked,
"Why are we honoring this man?

01:23:41.214 --> 01:23:44.342
Have we run out of human beings?"

01:23:44.417 --> 01:23:49.013
I mean, it's not always the most popular guy 
who gets the job done.

01:23:51.758 --> 01:23:55.421
You got losses of $20 to $30 million,
dividends cut to zero...

01:23:55.495 --> 01:23:58.419
and you're being squeezed to death 
by the majors.

01:23:58.498 --> 01:24:01.524
Now, present management may not be 
the worst scum of the earth...

01:24:01.601 --> 01:24:04.434
but they're the guys
that put you on this kamikaze course.

01:24:04.504 --> 01:24:09.203
And pretty soon, everybody
is gonna be scrambling for parachutes...

01:24:09.276 --> 01:24:11.870
only there's not enough to go around.

01:24:11.945 --> 01:24:16.735
Management has them.
You don't.

01:24:16.817 --> 01:24:20.150
Now, if they throw Bluestar to Chapter 11, 
which I think they will...

01:24:20.220 --> 01:24:23.053
they're gonna use the bankruptcy laws
to break your unions...

01:24:23.123 --> 01:24:26.149
your contracts,
and throw you guys off the property.

01:24:26.226 --> 01:24:28.717
Come on.
With all due respect, Mr. Gekko...

01:24:28.795 --> 01:24:31.218
what's to prevent you
from doing the same damn thing?

01:24:31.298 --> 01:24:33.562
'Cause I got a way around all this...

01:24:33.633 --> 01:24:38.388
a way we can all make money
and make the airline profitable.

01:24:38.471 --> 01:24:42.498
So what do you say 
we cut to the chase?

01:24:42.576 --> 01:24:47.104
I'm asking for a modest 20%
across-the-board wage cut...

01:24:47.180 --> 01:24:49.239
and seven more hours a month.

01:24:49.316 --> 01:24:52.774
What kind of time frame
are you talking about here?

01:24:52.853 --> 01:24:56.983
Give me a year. If we're still losing money, 
the reduction stands.

01:24:57.057 --> 01:24:59.446
If we're in the black,
I'll return part of the givebacks...

01:24:59.526 --> 01:25:01.482
salaries go back to their present level...

01:25:01.561 --> 01:25:05.588
and we initiate an employee
profit-sharing program...

01:25:05.665 --> 01:25:07.587
with stock.

01:25:07.667 --> 01:25:09.589
You can own part of the airline.

01:25:09.669 --> 01:25:11.591
Are you prepared to put that in writing?

01:25:11.671 --> 01:25:14.595
I'll have a letter of agreement
drafted up within two days.

01:25:14.674 --> 01:25:18.303
What's your marketing strategy?
How do you intend to return us to profitability?

01:25:18.378 --> 01:25:22.474
Why don't I give Buddy an opportunity 
to answer that. Buddy.

01:25:22.549 --> 01:25:24.471
Thank you, Gordon.

01:25:24.551 --> 01:25:28.373
First of all, I want you all to know
my door will always be open to you...

01:25:28.455 --> 01:25:32.619
because I know from my dad
that it's you guys that keep Bluestar flying.

01:25:32.692 --> 01:25:36.458
Now what I've come up with here
is a basic three-point plan, all right?

01:25:36.529 --> 01:25:38.520
One- 
We modernize.

01:25:38.598 --> 01:25:41.123
Our computer software is dog shit.
We update it.

01:25:41.201 --> 01:25:43.692
We squeeze every dollar
out of each seat and mile flown.

01:25:43.770 --> 01:25:47.661
You don't sell a seat to a guy for 79 bucks
when he's willing to pay 379.

01:25:47.741 --> 01:25:50.574
Effective inventory management
through computerization...

01:25:50.644 --> 01:25:53.602
will increase our load factor
by 5% to 20%.

01:25:53.680 --> 01:25:58.538
That translates to approximately
$50 to $200 million in revenues.

01:25:58.618 --> 01:26:01.917
The point being,
we can beat the majors at a price war.

01:26:01.988 --> 01:26:04.218
Two-
Advertising, very important.

01:26:04.291 --> 01:26:06.418
More, more, and aggressive.
We attack the majors!

01:26:06.493 --> 01:26:11.021
Three- Expansion. We expand our hubs
to Atlanta, North Carolina and St. Louis.

01:26:11.097 --> 01:26:14.021
And we reorganize all of our feeder schedules.

01:26:14.100 --> 01:26:17.592
We gotta think big, guys.
We're going after the majors. 

01:26:19.973 --> 01:26:22.999
Well, cards are on the table, guys.
What do you say?

01:26:23.076 --> 01:26:24.998
Well, if you mean what you say...

01:26:25.078 --> 01:26:28.036
I think we're probably in the ballpark.

01:26:28.114 --> 01:26:30.036
I guess I can take it to my people.

01:26:30.116 --> 01:26:32.812
- Good.
- You've sketched some broad strokes.

01:26:32.886 --> 01:26:35.218
I would like to see the fine print...

01:26:35.288 --> 01:26:37.347
but I like what I hear so far.

01:26:42.462 --> 01:26:46.023
Well, I guess if a man lives long enough,
he gets to see everything.

01:26:46.099 --> 01:26:48.260
And I do mean everything.

01:26:48.335 --> 01:26:50.860
What else you got
in your bag of tricks, Mr. Gekko?

01:26:52.337 --> 01:26:53.565
Frankly, Carl...

01:26:53.640 --> 01:26:56.598
I can't see giving much more,
but if you have any suggestions...

01:26:56.676 --> 01:26:59.440
I'll be very happy to listen.

01:26:59.512 --> 01:27:02.345
"There came into Egypt
a pharaoh who did not know."

01:27:02.415 --> 01:27:06.579
- I beg your pardon. Is that a proverb?
- No. A prophecy.

01:27:06.653 --> 01:27:09.486
The rich have been doing it to the poor 
since the beginning of time.

01:27:09.556 --> 01:27:11.979
The only difference between the pyramids
and the Empire State Building...

01:27:12.058 --> 01:27:14.014
is the Egyptians didn't allow unions.

01:27:14.094 --> 01:27:16.483
I know what this guy's all about- greed.

01:27:16.563 --> 01:27:18.861
He don't give a damn
about Bluestar or the unions.

01:27:18.932 --> 01:27:21.594
He's in and out for the buck,
and he don't take prisoners.

01:27:21.668 --> 01:27:23.590
- Now, wait just a minute, Dad.
- Well, sure.

01:27:23.670 --> 01:27:26.195
Now what's worth doing
is worth doing for money.

01:27:26.272 --> 01:27:29.730
It's a bad bargain if nobody gains.

01:27:29.809 --> 01:27:32.539
And if we do this deal,
everybody gains.

01:27:32.612 --> 01:27:34.739
Course, my son did work
as a baggage handler...

01:27:34.814 --> 01:27:36.805
and freight loader for three summers.

01:27:36.883 --> 01:27:40.649
With those qualifications, why should
we doubt his ability to run an airline?

01:27:40.720 --> 01:27:43.314
Fine. You don't want us,
stay with the scum in present management...

01:27:43.390 --> 01:27:47.212
dedicated to running you
and your airline into the ground.

01:27:47.293 --> 01:27:50.490
That scum built the company up
with one plane in 30 years...

01:27:50.563 --> 01:27:52.895
and made something out of nothing.

01:27:52.966 --> 01:27:55.696
If that's a scum,
I'll take it over a rat any day.

01:27:55.769 --> 01:27:57.828
You know where I stand.
Good night, all.

01:28:05.211 --> 01:28:06.941
Excuse me.

01:28:10.283 --> 01:28:12.205
Well, congratulations, Dad.

01:28:12.285 --> 01:28:15.516
You just did a great job of embarrassing me
in there, not to mention yourself!

01:28:15.588 --> 01:28:18.386
Save the "workers of the world unite"
speech for next time.

01:28:18.458 --> 01:28:20.380
- I heard it too much growing up!
- Oh, yeah?

01:28:20.460 --> 01:28:22.951
Yeah! You are gonna get axed, Dad,
no two ways about it.

01:28:22.996 --> 01:28:26.329
You and the whole shitty airline
are going down the tubes just like Braniff.

01:28:26.399 --> 01:28:28.697
If it isn't Gekko,
it's gonna be some other killer!

01:28:35.275 --> 01:28:37.197
He's using you, kid.

01:28:37.277 --> 01:28:40.303
He's got your prick in his back pocket,
but you're too blind to see it.

01:28:40.380 --> 01:28:43.110
No. What I see is a jealous old machinist...

01:28:43.183 --> 01:28:47.074
who can't stand the fact that his son's
become more successful than he has.

01:28:47.153 --> 01:28:51.010
What you see is a guy
who never measured a man's success...

01:28:51.091 --> 01:28:53.013
by the size of his wallet!

01:28:53.093 --> 01:28:57.951
That's because you never had the guts to go out 
into the world and stake your own claim!

01:29:07.340 --> 01:29:12.130
Boy, if that's the way you feel,
I must have done a really lousy job as a father.

01:29:16.749 --> 01:29:18.910
As far as being axed,
I'm still around.

01:29:18.985 --> 01:29:22.807
And as long as I am, I have a responsibility
to the union membership I represent.

01:29:22.889 --> 01:29:27.087
Your responsibility, Dad, is to present the facts,
not your opinions to your men.

01:29:27.160 --> 01:29:30.425
You're gonna destroy their lives. Don't do it.
Let the membership decide for themselves.

01:29:30.497 --> 01:29:33.386
When my men come to me tomorrow morning
wanting to know what the hell's going on...

01:29:33.466 --> 01:29:35.388
I'll be damned if I'm gonna lie to them!

01:29:35.468 --> 01:29:37.959
Oh, yeah, your men!
Your fucking men!

01:29:38.004 --> 01:29:41.098
All my life, your men
have been able to count on you!

01:29:41.174 --> 01:29:44.769
Why is it you've never been there for me, huh?

01:29:44.844 --> 01:29:46.766
And so what if you're wrong?

01:29:46.846 --> 01:29:50.703
What if one day the sun didn't rise in the east,
the birds didn't fly south for the winter...

01:29:50.783 --> 01:29:52.705
and for once, your compass was off?

01:29:52.785 --> 01:29:56.243
Would you be willing to wreck
your men's future, my future?

01:29:56.322 --> 01:29:58.244
Dad, think for a change!
Be practical!

01:29:58.324 --> 01:30:01.851
I'm asking you.
I'm fucking begging you.

01:30:01.928 --> 01:30:06.353
I don't go to sleep with no whore,
and I don't wake up with no whore.

01:30:06.432 --> 01:30:08.491
That's how I live with myself.

01:30:08.568 --> 01:30:10.490
I don't know how you do it.

01:30:10.570 --> 01:30:13.425
I hope I'm wrong about this guy...

01:30:13.506 --> 01:30:15.633
but I'll let the men decide for themselves.

01:30:15.708 --> 01:30:17.699
That much I promise you.

01:30:42.669 --> 01:30:46.196
Think you should have
a look at this, chief.

01:30:46.272 --> 01:30:48.194
Looks like we got a guy at Jackson-Steinem...

01:30:48.274 --> 01:30:53.098
buying large chunks of Teldar Paper
for an offshore account.

01:30:55.615 --> 01:30:57.640
Come on in.

01:30:57.717 --> 01:31:00.049
So, what's the <i>problema?</i>

01:31:00.119 --> 01:31:02.781
- Do you know what the fuck the problem is?
- What?

01:31:02.855 --> 01:31:05.380
- You don't know?
- I don't know.

01:31:05.458 --> 01:31:08.689
Well, shit.
I get a strange call from the S.E.C.

01:31:08.761 --> 01:31:11.719
They asked to see my records.
This is heavy, Bud.

01:31:11.798 --> 01:31:15.495
- Relax, Roget.
- Yeah, relax.

01:31:15.568 --> 01:31:18.230
You're 82-M in the account numbers,
and I'm the invisible man.

01:31:18.304 --> 01:31:20.064
That's good for you, Bud.

01:31:20.940 --> 01:31:22.931
They're always looking for red flags.

01:31:23.009 --> 01:31:25.807
Gekko's always getting checked by them.

01:31:25.878 --> 01:31:30.440
They never come up with anything, Rog.

01:31:30.516 --> 01:31:33.849
Hey.
We're invulnerable on this one.

01:31:33.920 --> 01:31:37.481
Listen.
I just want to slow down, Bud.

01:31:37.557 --> 01:31:41.618
All right?
No more lunches, no calls, all right?

01:31:41.694 --> 01:31:44.424
We suspend our business, all right?

01:31:44.497 --> 01:31:47.591
- Whatever you want, Rog. It's cool.
- Yeah, it's cool.

01:31:47.667 --> 01:31:50.898
Excuse me. Hey, Rog. Can you come on back in?
Bring the cost report with you.

01:31:50.970 --> 01:31:54.895
- They're starting again.
- All right. Yeah.

01:31:54.974 --> 01:31:59.536
Gekko's asked us into the Bluestar deal.
We're reviewing timetables.

01:31:59.612 --> 01:32:03.935
- You want to come?
- He didn't tell me about that.

01:32:04.017 --> 01:32:07.011
You're only the president of the company.
What the hell do you know anyway, right?

01:32:18.965 --> 01:32:22.526
- Guys, new chief of Bluestar, Bud Fox.
- Yeah, hi.

01:32:22.602 --> 01:32:25.233
- Hello, Bud.
- Look, guys, what's the problem? 

01:32:25.351 --> 01:32:26.834
It's time to kill. 

01:32:26.906 --> 01:32:29.739
Gekko's got 12% of the stock and climbing.

01:32:29.809 --> 01:32:32.232
Plus, he's got the unions
in his back pocket.

01:32:32.312 --> 01:32:34.678
And everybody knows that the stock's in play.

01:32:34.747 --> 01:32:37.341
By next week, 
the street's gonna own Bluestar.

01:32:37.417 --> 01:32:39.339
Is the bank financing in place...

01:32:39.419 --> 01:32:44.174
or are we gonna sit around and have more
and more of these ridiculous meetings?

01:32:44.257 --> 01:32:49.581
Our firm committed weeks ago 25%
of the total long-term debt structure...

01:32:49.662 --> 01:32:53.120
and unless you guys
sign this piece of paper right now...

01:32:53.199 --> 01:32:56.930
I'm gonna pull and go to another bank 
for the 75.

01:32:57.003 --> 01:33:00.530
- Look, we've got 30 banks ready to participate...
- Thirty banks?

01:33:00.606 --> 01:33:03.803
- in a four-year revolving credit line.
- Isn't that wonderful?

01:33:03.876 --> 01:33:07.972
But we must have your assurance
that you will pay back...

01:33:08.047 --> 01:33:10.880
most of the loan in the first 12 months.

01:33:10.950 --> 01:33:13.475
And the only way we can see this happening...

01:33:13.553 --> 01:33:16.579
is liquidating the hangars and the planes.

01:33:16.656 --> 01:33:20.752
Can you people guarantee
the liquidation of Bluestar?

01:33:20.827 --> 01:33:24.183
Guarantee? No sweat!
We got the Bleezburg brothers...

01:33:24.263 --> 01:33:26.891
lined up to build condos
where the hangars are.

01:33:26.966 --> 01:33:30.493
You lay the airplanes off to the Mexicans
who are dumb enough to buy them.

01:33:30.570 --> 01:33:35.132
And I got the Texas boys drooling at my kneecaps 
for the routes and slots.

01:33:35.208 --> 01:33:37.506
What's your problem?
It's done.

01:33:37.577 --> 01:33:41.274
These are the price tags on the 737s,
gates, hangars, routes.

01:33:41.347 --> 01:33:44.839
We got it nailed right down
to the typewriters.

01:33:44.917 --> 01:33:47.909
The beauty of this deal
is the overfunded pension.

01:33:47.987 --> 01:33:51.684
Gekko makes $75 million there.

01:33:51.758 --> 01:33:56.354
Fifty million buys him 
the minimum annuities for 6,000 employees...

01:33:56.429 --> 01:33:58.351
and he walks away with the rest.

01:33:58.431 --> 01:34:03.721
I figure he'll make 60-
He'll clear $60, $70 million.

01:34:03.803 --> 01:34:07.330
Not bad for a month's work.

01:34:07.407 --> 01:34:09.705
Your boy really did his homework, Fox.

01:34:09.776 --> 01:34:12.404
And you'll have the shortest 
executive career...

01:34:12.478 --> 01:34:15.367
since that pope that got poisoned.

01:34:15.448 --> 01:34:20.112
And now he'll really start believing
he's Gekko the Great.

01:34:21.621 --> 01:34:24.476
- Yes, he'd like to change that appointment.
- Hold this.

01:34:24.557 --> 01:34:26.946
Bud, you can't go in there.
He's in a meeting!

01:34:27.026 --> 01:34:30.325
Alex has come up with a really 
ingenious way for us to-

01:34:32.165 --> 01:34:34.827
I didn't know we had a meeting 
scheduled today, sport.

01:34:34.901 --> 01:34:38.258
I didn't either.
I think we should talk, Gordon.

01:34:39.338 --> 01:34:41.431
Would you gentlemen
excuse us for a second, please?

01:34:41.507 --> 01:34:44.362
Won't you come this way, gentlemen?

01:34:44.444 --> 01:34:46.642
Thank you, Alex.

01:34:48.714 --> 01:34:53.174
- What the hell do you want?
- I just found out about the garage sale at Bluestar.

01:34:53.252 --> 01:34:54.982
Why?

01:34:57.457 --> 01:35:01.188
Last night I was reading Rudy the story
of Winnie the Pooh and the honey pot.

01:35:01.260 --> 01:35:04.821
You know what happened?
He stuck his nose in the pot once too often...

01:35:04.897 --> 01:35:07.730
and he got stuck.

01:35:07.800 --> 01:35:10.291
Maybe you oughta read him <i>Pinocchio,</i> Gordon.

01:35:10.336 --> 01:35:14.830
I thought that you were gonna turn 
Bluestar around, not upside down.

01:35:14.907 --> 01:35:18.331
- You fuckin' used me!
- You're walking around blind without a cane, pal.

01:35:18.411 --> 01:35:21.574
A fool and his money are lucky enough
to get together in the first place.

01:35:21.647 --> 01:35:23.207
But why do you need to wreck this company?

01:35:23.244 --> 01:35:25.838
Because it's wreckable!
All right?

01:35:26.914 --> 01:35:29.337
I took another look at it
and I changed my mind.

01:35:29.416 --> 01:35:32.613
If these people lose their jobs,
they got nowhere to go.

01:35:32.686 --> 01:35:36.315
My father has worked there for 24 years.
I gave him my word!

01:35:36.390 --> 01:35:39.587
It's all about bucks, kid.

01:35:39.660 --> 01:35:42.288
The rest is conversation.

01:35:42.362 --> 01:35:44.853
Hey, Buddy, you're still
gonna be president, all right?

01:35:44.898 --> 01:35:47.856
And when the time comes,
you're gonna parachute out a rich man.

01:35:47.935 --> 01:35:49.857
With the money you're gonna make...

01:35:49.937 --> 01:35:52.929
your dad's never gonna have to work 
another day in his life.

01:35:53.006 --> 01:35:56.271
So tell me, Gordon, 
when does it all end?

01:35:56.343 --> 01:35:59.437
How many yachts can you water-ski behind?
How much is enough?

01:35:59.513 --> 01:36:02.004
It's not a question of enough, pal.

01:36:02.082 --> 01:36:06.007
It's a zero-sum game.
Somebody wins, somebody loses.

01:36:06.086 --> 01:36:08.281
Money itself isn't lost or made...

01:36:08.355 --> 01:36:12.917
it's simply, uh, transferred
from one perception to another...

01:36:12.993 --> 01:36:15.188
like magic.

01:36:15.262 --> 01:36:18.789
This painting here,
I bought it 10 years ago for $60,000.

01:36:18.866 --> 01:36:21.061
I could sell it today for 600.

01:36:21.134 --> 01:36:23.557
The illusion has become real.

01:36:23.637 --> 01:36:26.003
And the more real it becomes...

01:36:26.073 --> 01:36:28.928
the more desperate they want it.

01:36:29.009 --> 01:36:31.898
Capitalism at its finest.

01:36:31.979 --> 01:36:34.345
How much is enough, Gordon?

01:36:36.917 --> 01:36:41.013
The richest one percent of this country
owns half our country's wealth...

01:36:41.088 --> 01:36:43.386
five trillion dollars.

01:36:43.457 --> 01:36:45.379
One-third of that comes from hard work...

01:36:45.459 --> 01:36:47.415
two-thirds comes from an inheritance-

01:36:47.494 --> 01:36:50.986
interest on interest accumulating
to widows and idiot sons-

01:36:51.064 --> 01:36:55.353
and what I do-
stock and real estate speculation.

01:36:55.435 --> 01:36:57.357
It's bullshit.

01:36:57.437 --> 01:37:01.362
You got 90% of the American public out there 
with little or no net worth.

01:37:01.441 --> 01:37:04.501
I create nothing.

01:37:04.578 --> 01:37:07.172
I own.

01:37:07.247 --> 01:37:09.374
We make the rules, pal.

01:37:09.449 --> 01:37:12.282
The news, war, peace, famine, upheaval...

01:37:12.352 --> 01:37:14.377
the price of a paper clip.

01:37:14.454 --> 01:37:20.211
We pick that rabbit out of the hat while everybody 
sits there wondering how the hell we did it.

01:37:20.294 --> 01:37:25.254
You're not naive enough to think
we're living in a democracy, are you, Buddy?

01:37:25.332 --> 01:37:29.325
It's the free market.
And you're part of it.

01:37:29.403 --> 01:37:34.158
Yeah, you got that killer instinct.

01:37:34.241 --> 01:37:36.732
Stick around, pal.

01:37:36.777 --> 01:37:40.042
- I still got a lot to teach you.
- Obviously.

01:37:40.113 --> 01:37:43.378
Buddy, come on.
I was gonna tell you about it, all right?

01:37:43.450 --> 01:37:46.613
Calm down. We'll go up to the apartment tonight,
have a little dinner.

01:37:46.687 --> 01:37:49.178
- You bring Darien.
- No, I- I can't make it tonight.

01:37:49.222 --> 01:37:51.315
Hey, Buddy...

01:37:51.391 --> 01:37:53.382
are you with me?

01:37:54.428 --> 01:37:58.819
I need to know if you're with me.

01:37:58.899 --> 01:38:00.890
I'm with you, Gordon.

01:38:04.738 --> 01:38:08.504
- Natalie, I'll be right there.
- Yes, Mr. Gekko.

01:38:16.116 --> 01:38:18.448
- <i>Yeah.</i>
- Yeah, Ollie.

01:38:18.518 --> 01:38:22.045
You tell them I want zip-locked mouths
on the Bluestar deal...

01:38:22.122 --> 01:38:25.979
or I'm personally gonna come down there
and rip out their fuckin' throats.

01:39:08.702 --> 01:39:10.693
Bud?

01:39:12.739 --> 01:39:14.730
What's going on?

01:39:19.646 --> 01:39:21.944
I've been played like a grand piano...

01:39:22.015 --> 01:39:25.507
by the master, Gekko the Great.

01:39:25.585 --> 01:39:28.679
And today was the big crash.

01:39:28.755 --> 01:39:31.553
Liquidation sale.

01:39:31.625 --> 01:39:36.653
He's gonna carve Bluestar into little pieces 
and sell it all off.

01:39:36.730 --> 01:39:38.994
Bastard.

01:39:39.066 --> 01:39:43.628
I'm sorry. I was afraid
something like this could happen.

01:39:43.704 --> 01:39:46.935
I handed it to him on a silver platter.

01:39:47.007 --> 01:39:49.271
- I told my father, I told those people-
- Bud.

01:39:49.342 --> 01:39:53.904
Bud, it's not your fault,
and it's not your decision.

01:39:53.980 --> 01:39:55.936
I'm not gonna let it happen.

01:39:56.016 --> 01:40:01.215
Don't cross Gordon.
He'll crush you.

01:40:01.288 --> 01:40:03.347
If Gordon doesn't buy Bluestar,
someone else will...

01:40:03.423 --> 01:40:07.484
and who's to say they won't do
the same thing?

01:40:07.561 --> 01:40:11.952
At least I won't be pulling the trigger.

01:40:12.032 --> 01:40:14.262
Why are you doing this?

01:40:14.334 --> 01:40:17.724
You've worked hard to get where you are.

01:40:17.804 --> 01:40:22.070
We're so close.
You don't want to throw it all away.

01:40:22.142 --> 01:40:25.373
Look, I can stay with the firm,
and you're doing fine.

01:40:25.445 --> 01:40:29.108
We can survive without Gordon Gekko.

01:40:36.123 --> 01:40:39.251
I'm not looking to just survive.

01:40:39.326 --> 01:40:42.159
I've been doing that all my life.

01:40:42.229 --> 01:40:45.289
Cut this self-pity crap, Bud.

01:40:45.365 --> 01:40:49.392
What the hell's that supposed to mean?

01:40:49.469 --> 01:40:53.132
It means if you make an enemy 
of Gordon Gekko...

01:40:53.206 --> 01:40:56.562
I can't be there to stand by you.

01:40:56.643 --> 01:41:00.841
- Oh, yeah? Do you really mean that?
- Yeah.

01:41:00.914 --> 01:41:05.271
What did he promise you?
Take you public?

01:41:05.352 --> 01:41:07.877
I guess without Gordon's money
and seal of approval...

01:41:07.954 --> 01:41:11.117
I'm not such a hot investment anymore, huh?

01:41:11.191 --> 01:41:14.024
You're just the best money can buy, Darien.

01:41:14.094 --> 01:41:16.016
You're not exactly pure, Bud.

01:41:16.096 --> 01:41:19.361
You went after Gekko 
with the same vengeance you went after me.

01:41:19.432 --> 01:41:21.388
- Look in the mirror-
- I'm looking...

01:41:21.468 --> 01:41:24.596
and I sure don't like what I see.

01:41:26.072 --> 01:41:31.135
Fair enough,
but it's not that simple, Bud.

01:41:31.211 --> 01:41:34.544
When I was down and had nothing,
it was Gordon who helped me.

01:41:34.614 --> 01:41:37.970
He got me all my clients,
you among them.

01:41:38.051 --> 01:41:41.782
He can take them away from me like that.

01:41:41.855 --> 01:41:44.983
You may find out one day that
when you've had money and lost it...

01:41:45.058 --> 01:41:47.891
it's much worse
than never having had it at all.

01:41:47.961 --> 01:41:51.385
Oh, yeah?
Well, that is bullshit!

01:41:53.300 --> 01:41:55.825
Hey! Hey!

01:41:55.902 --> 01:41:59.463
You step out that door,
and I am changing the locks!

01:42:01.875 --> 01:42:05.572
You may not believe this, Bud...

01:42:05.645 --> 01:42:08.705
but I really do care for you.

01:42:08.782 --> 01:42:13.242
We would have made a good team.
I'm sorry.

01:42:14.688 --> 01:42:17.077
Get the fuck out of here.

01:42:31.571 --> 01:42:33.698
The market is dead right now.

01:42:33.773 --> 01:42:35.695
Even the rich are bitchin'.

01:42:35.775 --> 01:42:38.608
Only thing that's moving
is the Puerto Ricans and the cockroaches.

01:42:38.678 --> 01:42:40.600
And with the high commission that I get-

01:42:40.680 --> 01:42:44.639
Save the rap.
Just sell the fucker fast.

01:42:52.259 --> 01:42:54.682
There he is.
Buddy, where you been the last two days?

01:42:54.761 --> 01:42:57.423
Get my father on the phone
and the other two union reps.

01:42:57.497 --> 01:43:00.091
Your mom's been calling, Bud.
Your father, he's, um-

01:43:00.166 --> 01:43:03.124
- What happened?
- He had a heart attack, but he's all right.

01:43:03.203 --> 01:43:06.366
- He's at St. John's.
- Oh, Christ.

01:43:12.445 --> 01:43:14.970
Mom, how is he?

01:43:15.048 --> 01:43:18.006
- He was complaining about chest pains at work.
- Buddy.

01:43:18.084 --> 01:43:21.941
And the next thing they know, he's collapsed. 
You got to talk to him.

01:43:22.022 --> 01:43:25.549
He's a tough old nut, your dad.
He's got another 20 years.

01:43:25.625 --> 01:43:29.117
- He's gonna be fine, Buddy.
- Is he conscious?

01:43:45.245 --> 01:43:47.167
Hiya, Dad.

01:43:48.682 --> 01:43:51.014
You're looking younger every day.

01:43:52.919 --> 01:43:56.685
Didn't I tell you never to lift
a 747 by yourself?

01:43:59.192 --> 01:44:02.116
You even got me smoking now.

01:44:06.099 --> 01:44:10.160
It's your second heart attack, Dad.

01:44:10.236 --> 01:44:13.000
You're pushing your luck.
I hope you know that.

01:44:14.374 --> 01:44:17.298
I guess I never told you...

01:44:17.377 --> 01:44:19.572
but I love you, Dad.

01:44:23.116 --> 01:44:25.243
I love you so much.

01:44:28.054 --> 01:44:31.251
I'm sorry about the things I said.

01:44:34.127 --> 01:44:36.823
You're the only honest man I know-

01:44:36.896 --> 01:44:38.718
the best.

01:44:40.800 --> 01:44:43.166
I got a plan, Dad.
I can save the airline.

01:44:43.236 --> 01:44:48.629
I know you got no reason to believe me,
but you have to trust me, okay?

01:44:48.708 --> 01:44:52.872
I need to speak to the union members.

01:44:52.946 --> 01:44:54.937
Can I speak for you?

01:44:56.516 --> 01:44:59.246
Your words, not mine.

01:45:01.955 --> 01:45:03.946
Okay.

01:45:06.860 --> 01:45:08.851
Thank you.

01:45:12.499 --> 01:45:15.127
I gotta go. 

01:45:15.201 --> 01:45:17.965
I'm proud of you.

01:45:18.038 --> 01:45:20.029
Thanks.

01:45:26.546 --> 01:45:29.037
The stock's at 19 and a quarter
and it's going up.

01:45:29.082 --> 01:45:32.609
Gekko figures by breaking up Bluestar,
it's worth at least 30 bucks a share.

01:45:32.685 --> 01:45:35.483
He'll buy up to 24
and still think he's making money.

01:45:35.555 --> 01:45:38.786
How do you know it's gonna go up?

01:45:38.858 --> 01:45:43.352
I don't think you wanna know any more than that,
Duncan. Let's just say I have some friends.

01:45:43.430 --> 01:45:46.593
Okay.
What happens now?

01:45:46.666 --> 01:45:49.760
When it hits 23, you guys
go to Gekko and you lower the boom.

01:45:49.836 --> 01:45:53.602
When he learns he has no union concessions,
he'll jump ship and sell everything he's got.

01:45:53.673 --> 01:45:56.597
But who's gonna buy then,
and what's to prevent some other shark...

01:45:56.676 --> 01:45:58.769
from coming along and devouring us?

01:46:01.314 --> 01:46:04.442
We have an appointment to see Mr. Wildman.

01:46:04.517 --> 01:46:08.476
Sir Lawrence-
or can I call you Larry?

01:46:08.555 --> 01:46:10.887
What would you say
to owning Bluestar Airlines...

01:46:10.957 --> 01:46:14.848
with union concessions at $18 a share...

01:46:14.928 --> 01:46:19.456
and in the process hanging Gordon Gekko 
out in the wind to twist?

01:46:19.532 --> 01:46:21.488
I might be very interested.

01:46:21.568 --> 01:46:23.490
Why you, mate?

01:46:23.570 --> 01:46:26.403
What's a bloke like you
doing mixed up with Gekko?

01:46:26.473 --> 01:46:29.863
Let's just say that me and Mr. Gekko...

01:46:29.943 --> 01:46:33.276
have a serious conflict of interest.

01:46:33.346 --> 01:46:36.509
We all want to see this airline work.

01:46:36.583 --> 01:46:38.972
These figures show that it can.

01:46:40.887 --> 01:46:44.118
You're prepared to take
these large salary cuts?

01:46:44.190 --> 01:46:48.650
We are, but we want a contract agreement 
that's ironclad.

01:46:48.728 --> 01:46:52.084
So if you buy it, 
you can't break it up.

01:46:54.934 --> 01:46:56.925
I'm still listening.

01:47:01.875 --> 01:47:04.241
- Hi.
- Oh, hi.

01:47:04.310 --> 01:47:06.904
Say, why don't you get the hell 
out of my office.

01:47:06.980 --> 01:47:10.245
Marv, I know I've been a bit of a schmuck lately,
and I just want to apologize.

01:47:10.316 --> 01:47:14.241
You've been a real schmuck lately.
Go thou and sin no more.

01:47:14.320 --> 01:47:16.811
I want to make it up to you.

01:47:18.856 --> 01:47:20.053
Bluestar.

01:47:20.126 --> 01:47:22.549
Put all your clients in it.

01:47:27.667 --> 01:47:29.794
Okay, Buddy, Buddy.

01:47:29.869 --> 01:47:33.100
We are back in business on Bluestar.

01:47:35.275 --> 01:47:38.369
- Hi.
- Bluestar, Mr. Mannheim.

01:47:38.444 --> 01:47:41.436
Put all your clients in it.
It's gonna move.

01:47:41.514 --> 01:47:43.846
I don't know where you get 
your information, son...

01:47:43.917 --> 01:47:46.613
but I don't like it.

01:47:46.686 --> 01:47:49.314
The main thing about money, Bud...

01:47:49.389 --> 01:47:52.950
it makes you do things
you don't wanna do.

01:47:55.962 --> 01:47:58.021
Marty, I need a favor.
It's a quick scalp for you.

01:47:58.097 --> 01:48:02.557
200,000 shares Bluestar at 19 and a half.
Can you position it in one of your equity funds?

01:48:02.635 --> 01:48:05.866
- The <i>Chronicle's</i> on seven.
- Hold, Marty.

01:48:05.939 --> 01:48:10.865
Listen, Blue Horseshoe loves Bluestar Airlines.
Got it?

01:48:10.944 --> 01:48:13.640
- <i>Got it.</i>
- Right. Marty, you still there?

01:48:13.713 --> 01:48:18.343
Bluestar's in play.
Let's check it out.

01:48:25.425 --> 01:48:27.586
- Nineteen and a quarter at three-eighths.
- 10,000.

01:48:27.660 --> 01:48:29.582
Sell you 10,000 at three-eighths.

01:48:29.662 --> 01:48:31.584
I love it.

01:48:31.664 --> 01:48:34.292
I do love it so.

01:48:34.367 --> 01:48:38.792
Gordon, I see it at 21 and five-eighths.
I don't know what to make of it.

01:48:38.871 --> 01:48:43.228
The word is out, pal.
Your union buddies are talking.

01:48:43.309 --> 01:48:47.166
You get me in at a 45-degree angle.
I mean, all the way in.

01:48:47.247 --> 01:48:50.705
You slash and burn.
Buy everything in sight up to 22.

01:48:50.783 --> 01:48:52.705
Then call me.

01:48:52.785 --> 01:48:55.310
When I get hold of the son of a bitch 
who leaked this...

01:48:55.388 --> 01:48:58.516
I'm gonna tear his eyeballs out,
I'm gonna suck his fuckin' skull.

01:49:07.533 --> 01:49:09.524
- Stock's going to Pluto, man.
- Start unloading.

01:49:09.602 --> 01:49:12.298
- Sell?
- Dump it now. Dump it all.

01:49:12.372 --> 01:49:16.001
- Where's Lou?
- Right over there.

01:49:16.075 --> 01:49:18.464
Ken. Ken, Marv at Jackson-Steinem.

01:49:18.544 --> 01:49:22.071
We gotta dump this baby. Take the money
and run on B.S.T. We're getting out now.

01:49:22.148 --> 01:49:24.537
It's gotta be a big hitter.

01:49:24.617 --> 01:49:28.212
There's a batch of people from
Bluestar Airlines demanding to see you.

01:49:28.288 --> 01:49:31.246
- What the hell do they want?
- I'd be happy to tell you.

01:49:31.324 --> 01:49:34.748
We know what you're up to, Gekko.
And let me tell you this from right here.

01:49:34.827 --> 01:49:38.524
You can go straight to hell.
No way you're gonna break up our airline.

01:49:38.598 --> 01:49:42.056
If that's my plans,
that's the first I've heard of it.

01:49:42.135 --> 01:49:44.091
Would you care to put that in writing, please?

01:49:44.170 --> 01:49:47.662
I'd like to remind you we have an agreement,
which I expect you to honor.

01:49:47.740 --> 01:49:50.231
Well, in that case,
you better hope to have your pilot's license.

01:49:50.276 --> 01:49:52.870
Don't worry, Gekko. 
We won't let the engines fall out of the planes.

01:49:52.945 --> 01:49:56.437
Those flight reservation systems can get awfully
screwed up if we're not paying attention.

01:49:56.516 --> 01:50:00.247
A lot of the baggage headed for St. Petersburg
could very easily wind up in Pittsburgh.

01:50:00.320 --> 01:50:02.948
Look! All right?
Somebody else wants to buy your airline.

01:50:03.022 --> 01:50:07.652
You wanna be Pac-Man and get gobbled up
by Attila the Hun, you be my guest!

01:50:07.727 --> 01:50:10.218
We'll take our chances.

01:50:10.263 --> 01:50:12.595
Nice to see you, Gekko.

01:50:16.135 --> 01:50:19.059
Fox says Bluestar just hit 23.

01:50:19.138 --> 01:50:21.197
What do you want him to do?

01:50:22.775 --> 01:50:25.801
Sell it all.

01:50:25.878 --> 01:50:28.039
What the hell?
So we only make 10 million.

01:50:28.114 --> 01:50:30.605
Sell it.
Yes, all of it.

01:50:30.650 --> 01:50:35.644
10,000 at seven-eighths.
Sold! Sold!

01:50:35.722 --> 01:50:38.555
Break! Break! Break!
For Christ's sake!

01:50:38.624 --> 01:50:40.854
Can't get a goddamn connection here!

01:50:40.927 --> 01:50:45.159
Bob, Marv at Jackson-Steinem.
In big trouble on B.S.T. You gotta get out now.

01:50:45.231 --> 01:50:47.893
- Another 30,000 out!
- Gekko is on the ropes.

01:50:47.967 --> 01:50:50.731
He's trying to sell but there's not many takers.
The stock is plummeting.

01:50:50.803 --> 01:50:56.059
Well then, I guess I'll have to carry him
a few rounds before he drops.

01:50:56.142 --> 01:50:58.337
Don't make a big deal of it.

01:50:58.411 --> 01:51:00.367
Buy it lightly on the way down.

01:51:00.446 --> 01:51:03.279
When it hits 18, buy it all.

01:51:03.349 --> 01:51:05.180
Piece of cake, Larry.

01:51:10.022 --> 01:51:12.547
- 10,000 at 18.
- 10,000 at 18.

01:51:12.625 --> 01:51:16.721
Hold it!
What is offered at 18?

01:51:16.796 --> 01:51:19.321
- 300,000!
- 300,000 at 18.

01:51:19.399 --> 01:51:22.129
- 18 for 500,000.
- Sold! Sold!

01:51:25.204 --> 01:51:27.434
- I'll sell you 50!
- I take it.

01:51:33.913 --> 01:51:38.668
- There's got to be a way out of this, Gordon.
- Sure. Why don't you dial 911?

01:51:38.751 --> 01:51:41.948
- Fox is on four.
- Hey, Fox, where the hell are you?

01:51:42.021 --> 01:51:46.378
I am losing millions. You got me into this airline. 
You sure as hell better get me out...

01:51:46.459 --> 01:51:49.656
or the only job you're ever gonna have 
on this street is sweeping it.

01:51:49.729 --> 01:51:51.685
<i>You hear me, Fox?</i>

01:51:51.764 --> 01:51:54.756
You once told me don't get emotional 
about stock, Gordon.

01:51:54.834 --> 01:51:58.463
Don't. The bid is 16 and a half
and going down.

01:51:58.538 --> 01:52:00.768
As your broker, I advise you to take it.

01:52:00.840 --> 01:52:03.001
<i>Yeah? Well, you take it...</i>

01:52:03.075 --> 01:52:06.067
right in the ass,
you fuckin' scumbag cocksucker!

01:52:06.145 --> 01:52:08.739
It's two minutes to close, Gordon.

01:52:08.815 --> 01:52:11.511
What do you want to do?
Decide.

01:52:16.222 --> 01:52:18.213
Dump it.

01:52:23.196 --> 01:52:25.858
<i>The big Wall Street story today...</i>

01:52:25.932 --> 01:52:28.162
<i>was the roller coaster ride
of Bluestar Airlines.</i>

01:52:28.234 --> 01:52:30.862
<i>Fueled by takeover rumors,
the stock soared...</i>

01:52:30.937 --> 01:52:33.565
<i>to an all-time high of 24 and an eighth.</i>

01:52:33.639 --> 01:52:37.496
<i>Then when contradictory rumors later surfaced 
that the takeover was unfounded...</i>

01:52:37.577 --> 01:52:41.274
<i>buyers went running for cover 
and the stock plummeted on gigantic volume...</i>

01:52:41.347 --> 01:52:45.272
<i>to as low as 16 and a half
before closing at 17.</i>

01:52:45.351 --> 01:52:49.173
<i>But then tonight amidst all the scuttlebutt,
another rumble shook the street.</i>

01:52:49.255 --> 01:52:52.611
<i>According to many sources, 
raider Sir Lawrence Wildman has stepped in...</i>

01:52:52.692 --> 01:52:55.058
<i>and bought a substantial block of Bluestar...</i>

01:52:55.127 --> 01:52:57.357
<i>and is going to announce a deal 
tomorrow at 18...</i>

01:52:57.430 --> 01:52:59.523
<i>that includes the support of the unions.</i>

01:52:59.599 --> 01:53:03.057
<i>This reporter talked today with
a leading stock market technical analyst...</i>

01:53:03.135 --> 01:53:05.558
<i>in order to better understand the ramifications-</i>

01:53:05.638 --> 01:53:07.560
Son of a bitch!

01:53:18.551 --> 01:53:21.543
Smile, Carolyn.
There's justice in the world.

01:53:36.369 --> 01:53:38.360
Good morning, folks.

01:53:51.284 --> 01:53:53.275
What?
Did somebody die?

01:53:54.687 --> 01:53:56.078
Yeah.

01:54:02.695 --> 01:54:05.687
- Good morning, Chuckie. Good morning, Lou.
- Bud.

01:54:08.167 --> 01:54:11.056
Bud, I like you.

01:54:11.137 --> 01:54:13.128
Just remember something.

01:54:18.978 --> 01:54:21.538
Man looks in the abyss.

01:54:21.614 --> 01:54:24.174
There's nothing staring back at him.

01:54:24.250 --> 01:54:27.606
At that moment, 
man finds his character...

01:54:27.687 --> 01:54:30.918
and that is what keeps him
out of the abyss.

01:54:33.192 --> 01:54:35.183
I think I understand, Lou.

01:54:46.138 --> 01:54:48.561
Janet, get my father, will you?

01:54:51.611 --> 01:54:53.943
He just came in. I'll call you back.

01:54:59.285 --> 01:55:01.378
I guess you're not here to open an I.R.A.

01:55:01.454 --> 01:55:04.787
Mr. Fox, I'm Henry Patterson
with the Postal Inspection Service.

01:55:04.857 --> 01:55:07.519
This is Mr. Ebanhopper
from the U.S. Attorney's office...

01:55:07.593 --> 01:55:10.824
Evan Morrissey from the 
Securities and Exchange enforcement office.

01:55:10.896 --> 01:55:12.818
You' re under arrest, Mr. Fox...

01:55:12.898 --> 01:55:14.820
for conspiracy to commit securities fraud...

01:55:14.900 --> 01:55:17.926
and for violating
the Insider Trader's Sanction Act.

01:55:18.004 --> 01:55:22.327
The minute I laid eyes on you,
I knew you were no good.

01:55:22.408 --> 01:55:24.933
You have the right to remain silent and refuse 
to answer questions. Do you understand?

01:55:25.011 --> 01:55:28.105
Anything you do say may be used against you.
on the court of law.

01:55:28.180 --> 01:55:31.536
You have the right to consult an attorney
before speaking to the police...

01:55:31.617 --> 01:55:34.081
and to have an attorney present 
during any questioning now or in the future.

01:56:02.782 --> 01:56:04.773
So long, Carolyn.

01:56:17.997 --> 01:56:21.296
- Hiya, Buddy.
- Gordon.

01:56:21.367 --> 01:56:24.825
You sandbagged me on Bluestar, huh?

01:56:24.904 --> 01:56:27.168
I guess you think
you taught the teacher a lesson-

01:56:27.239 --> 01:56:30.037
that the tail can wag the dog, huh?

01:56:33.546 --> 01:56:35.639
Well, let me clue you in, pal.

01:56:35.715 --> 01:56:39.378
The ice is melting right underneath your feet.

01:56:42.421 --> 01:56:47.085
You think you could have got this far
this fast with anybody else, huh?

01:56:47.159 --> 01:56:49.719
You think you'd be dicking
someone like Darien? No.

01:56:49.795 --> 01:56:55.051
You'd be cold-calling widows and dentists
to buy 20 shares of some fuckin' dog shit stock.

01:56:55.134 --> 01:56:57.193
I took you in.

01:56:57.269 --> 01:56:59.362
A nobody!

01:56:59.438 --> 01:57:03.397
I opened the doors for you.
I showed you how the system works...

01:57:03.476 --> 01:57:06.741
the value of information, 
how to get it!

01:57:06.812 --> 01:57:10.077
Fulham Oil, Brant Resources, Geo Dynamics.

01:57:10.149 --> 01:57:12.777
And this is how you fucking pay me back, 
you cockroach!

01:57:15.054 --> 01:57:17.784
I gave you Darien!

01:57:17.857 --> 01:57:20.655
I gave you your manhood.
I gave you everything!

01:57:33.639 --> 01:57:36.403
You could have been
one of the great ones, Buddy.

01:57:38.043 --> 01:57:41.433
I look at you... 
and I see myself.

01:57:43.282 --> 01:57:45.273
Why?

01:57:46.652 --> 01:57:48.643
I don't know.

01:57:50.422 --> 01:57:54.916
I guess I realized that I'm just Bud Fox.

01:57:57.296 --> 01:58:00.629
As much as I wanted to be Gordon Gekko...

01:58:00.699 --> 01:58:03.122
I'll always be Bud Fox.

01:58:49.315 --> 01:58:51.476
<i>I showed you how the system works...</i>

01:58:51.550 --> 01:58:53.677
<i>the value of information,
how to get it!</i>

01:58:53.752 --> 01:58:57.244
<i>Fulham Oil, Brant Resources-</i>

01:58:59.325 --> 01:59:01.748
You did the right thing, Bud.

01:59:08.434 --> 01:59:11.392
You told the truth and gave the money back.

01:59:11.470 --> 01:59:15.327
All things considered in this cockamamie world, 
you're shooting par.

01:59:15.407 --> 01:59:19.138
You helped save the airline. 
And the airline people are gonna remember you for it.

01:59:19.211 --> 01:59:21.634
That's right. If I were you,
I'd think about the job...

01:59:21.714 --> 01:59:23.773
at Bluestar that Wildman offered you.

01:59:23.849 --> 01:59:26.079
Dad, I'm going to jail,
and you know it.

01:59:26.151 --> 01:59:29.848
Yeah, well, maybe that's the price, son.

01:59:29.922 --> 01:59:31.844
It's gonna be hard on you,
that's for sure.

01:59:31.924 --> 01:59:34.290
But maybe in some kind of screwed-up way...

01:59:34.360 --> 01:59:37.193
it's the best thing 
that could have happened to you.

01:59:37.263 --> 01:59:40.687
You stop going for the easy buck
and produce something with your life.

01:59:40.766 --> 01:59:46.329
Create instead of living off
the buying and selling of others.

01:59:50.776 --> 01:59:55.167
- We'll park the car and catch up with you.
- All right.
