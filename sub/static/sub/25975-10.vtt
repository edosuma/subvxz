00:20.680 --> 00:22.011
-[woman] Smile.
-[camera shutter clicks]

00:25.650 --> 00:28.187
-You want a do-over?
-Uh,no.

00:28.820 --> 00:29.764
-Are you sure?
-Yep.

00:29.860 --> 00:31.771
IfI was going on a trip, I'd be smiling.

00:31.860 --> 00:36.308
Well, it's a white background, no shadow,
eyes open, neutral expression.

00:36.410 --> 00:38.401
That's a TSA checklist right there.

00:39.030 --> 00:41.658
-So, where are you headed?
-Abroad.

00:52.420 --> 00:53.500
[Ruth] Holy shit.

00:54.920 --> 00:55.875
[Marty] I know.

00:57.050 --> 00:58.756
[Ruth] How much money is there?

00:58.850 --> 01:00.886
[Marty] Approximately $43 million.

01:00.970 --> 01:02.597
[Ruth] Holy shit. [Marty] The exact numbers are in here,

01:04.390 --> 01:08.429
along with a complete listing
of the real accounts, plus their shadows.

01:08.520 --> 01:13.389
And the operational account
is gonna be active... [grunts]

01:13.490 --> 01:16.448
as soon as we're done with the ceremony,
day after tomorrow.

01:22.200 --> 01:23.940
What if I can't do this?

01:24.040 --> 01:25.826
It's just like Lickety Splitz,
only bigger.

01:25.910 --> 01:27.116
You're gonna come here,

01:27.210 --> 01:28.871
you're gonna pay respects to Buddy
a couple of times a week.

01:28.960 --> 01:30.916
You're gonna mix this money
with the legit receipts

01:31.000 --> 01:32.331
and then you're gonna deposit it.

01:32.420 --> 01:34.911
Long as the flow stays steady,
no one's gonna bat an eye.

01:35.380 --> 01:36.756
This is crazy.

01:38.550 --> 01:40.131
I don't know shit about fuck.

01:41.100 --> 01:41.998
Ruth.

01:43.720 --> 01:46.803
Which LP is held by Davisville Limited?

01:49.850 --> 01:51.181
Lighthouse Landing.

01:51.770 --> 01:54.432
-And where are they registered?
-Panama City.

01:55.690 --> 01:57.146
And they're a shell company for?

01:57.240 --> 02:01.825
Horizon Cove Inc, which is a subsidiary
for Byrde Enterprises.

02:03.240 --> 02:06.198
If I didn't think you could handle it,
I wouldn't be risking my family's lives.

02:09.210 --> 02:10.825
[Helen] Thanks for the walkthrough.

02:11.840 --> 02:14.331
As these things get close,
my client always gets nervous.

02:14.420 --> 02:15.500
He's very detail-oriented.

02:15.590 --> 02:18.798
[Wendy] Well, it's my pleasure.
I find it oddly beautiful.

02:18.880 --> 02:20.381
[Marty] Hi. Sorry I'm late.

02:20.970 --> 02:22.005
Hi.

02:22.100 --> 02:23.590
I was just about to tell your wife,

02:23.680 --> 02:25.716
you can see the rest of your life
from up here.

02:25.810 --> 02:27.721
-[Marty] Yeah.
-Everything okay?

02:29.190 --> 02:31.556
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
Just some personal stuff.

02:31.650 --> 02:32.856
-[Wendy] Mm-hmm.
-How you doing?

02:32.940 --> 02:35.647
I trust if there were any
last-minute issues, you'd let me know.

02:36.030 --> 02:36.849
Of course.

02:36.940 --> 02:39.522
-Now would be the time to fix them.
-We're good.

02:40.780 --> 02:42.441
[Zeke cooing]

02:42.530 --> 02:45.328
I'm not sure you appreciate
the historical significance

02:45.410 --> 02:47.071
of what it is you're about to pull off.

02:48.160 --> 02:49.957
Medelln, Sinaloa, Jurez,

02:50.040 --> 02:52.531
every one of them tried to create
something like this.

02:52.630 --> 02:53.915
Every one of them failed.

02:54.000 --> 02:57.584
A legitimate, self-sustaining operation
like a casino.

02:57.670 --> 02:59.581
This is why crime organizes.

03:00.470 --> 03:03.177
Have you given any thought
to the next five years?

03:03.260 --> 03:05.842
Uh, I'd love to talk about
the operational account.

03:05.930 --> 03:07.807
Because you're pillars
of the community now.

03:07.890 --> 03:11.098
You've established a foothold
in the gaming industry.

03:11.190 --> 03:13.932
You could expand, completely legitimately.

03:14.020 --> 03:16.227
Honoring your obligations
to my client, obviously.

03:16.320 --> 03:17.526
[Zeke coos]

03:17.610 --> 03:20.943
I am so sorry, but I have to get him home.

03:21.030 --> 03:24.022
I mean, it's just been a long time
since we've been tied to a nap schedule.

03:24.120 --> 03:25.826
It's funny how you forget
there was ever a time

03:25.910 --> 03:28.037
before they could tell you
to go fuck yourself.

03:28.120 --> 03:29.610
[chuckles] But not you.

03:30.290 --> 03:31.700
No. You wouldn't call up and talk

03:31.790 --> 03:33.951
about your father's girlfriend,
would you? No.

03:34.040 --> 03:35.337
The operational account.

03:35.880 --> 03:38.087
-What about it? _
-It's not up and running.

03:38.170 --> 03:39.831
Once the contracts are signed.

03:40.380 --> 03:43.042
That's in two days.
I could be working now.

03:44.470 --> 03:46.847
Well, is there some kind of rush
I'm not aware of?

03:47.970 --> 03:49.517
Just trying to be efficient.

03:50.850 --> 03:52.511
Well, call us superstitious.

03:52.600 --> 03:53.555
On a long road trip,

03:53.650 --> 03:56.221
you're most likely to get into an accident
a mile from your home.

04:05.160 --> 04:06.946
-[Wendy] You okay?
-[Marty] Yeah.

04:08.030 --> 04:09.827
What did you have to take care of?

04:10.830 --> 04:12.149
Just life stuff.

04:12.540 --> 04:16.624
Hmm. I called the school.
Charlotte went to first period.

04:18.800 --> 04:19.789
Great.

04:21.420 --> 04:22.796
Helen's right, you know.

04:23.590 --> 04:26.388
This could be the beginning
of a great new chapter in our lives.

04:27.720 --> 04:29.927
We just have to work harder
at being better parents.

04:33.140 --> 04:34.846
What if that's not possible here?

04:35.520 --> 04:36.896
It has to be.

04:36.980 --> 04:38.220
[Zeke cooing]

04:39.570 --> 04:41.470
Oh, yeah. Okay.

04:46.240 --> 04:49.198
[Cade] I was there.
I saw the cartel torture her.

04:49.280 --> 04:50.611
[Petty] Mm-hmm.

04:50.700 --> 04:53.703
Well, could you get her
to file charges against him?

04:53.790 --> 04:56.281
[Cade] Well, I know he paid
for that paddle wheeler in cash.

04:56.370 --> 04:59.589
-[Petty] Well, that's not illegal.
-It is if it's cartel money.

05:00.750 --> 05:02.331
[Petty] Do you know where he hides it?

05:04.550 --> 05:05.619
What about the books?

05:06.840 --> 05:08.421
Do you even know where he keeps 'em?

05:09.220 --> 05:10.130
Does he even talk to you?

05:10.220 --> 05:11.881
If you were wired,
would he confide in you?

05:11.970 --> 05:13.096
He talks to my daughter.

05:13.180 --> 05:15.592
Yeah, and would you wear
a wire against her?

05:19.980 --> 05:20.935
You know what I think?

05:22.110 --> 05:23.316
I think you're looking at me

05:23.400 --> 05:25.311
as some kind of
"get out of jail free" card.

05:25.400 --> 05:27.197
[Cade] No, I'm giving you
Marty fucking Byrde.

05:27.280 --> 05:28.736
[Petty] You didn't give me shit.

05:28.820 --> 05:32.199
You haven't said a single thing
that I don't already know.

05:32.290 --> 05:34.827
In fact, I have no confidence you can get
anywhere close to Marty Byrde.

05:34.910 --> 05:36.070
You fucking owe me.

05:36.160 --> 05:37.457
[laughs]

05:37.540 --> 05:39.622
-I owe you?
-Yeah, that's right.

05:40.210 --> 05:41.336
I don't even know you.

05:41.840 --> 05:45.207
You got my fucking daughter tortured.
You got my brothers killed.

05:45.300 --> 05:46.255
You know what?

05:46.970 --> 05:50.042
Your five minutes are up,
so get the fuck away from me.

05:53.640 --> 05:55.631
What? You don't like hearing the truth?

05:55.730 --> 05:57.630
[sighs] The truth?

05:58.350 --> 06:00.727
The truth is, you smell desperate.

06:01.610 --> 06:02.429
It reeks.

06:02.520 --> 06:04.522
I give it a month
before you're back in prison.

06:04.610 --> 06:07.693
And your fucking
trailer-trash daughter... [scoffs]

06:07.780 --> 06:09.736
who you're so willing to rat out.

06:12.240 --> 06:14.117
She's in so far over her head,

06:14.200 --> 06:17.784
[laughs] it'll be a minute behind you,
whether I'm following the case or not.

06:17.870 --> 06:20.703
The truth is that Russ
deserved better than every fucking--

06:20.790 --> 06:21.779
[Cade yells] [both panting]

06:27.420 --> 06:28.580
Oh, fuck.

06:30.800 --> 06:31.676
[grunts]

06:32.970 --> 06:34.961
[grunting]

07:41.500 --> 07:43.161
[water bubbling]

08:16.490 --> 08:18.481
[Zeke cooing]

08:26.040 --> 08:27.371
[Wendy] Darlene.

08:27.460 --> 08:28.916
[Darlene] I thought you should know...

08:30.210 --> 08:32.212
Jacob passed away this morning.

08:34.090 --> 08:35.045
What?

08:37.010 --> 08:37.999
Oh, Darlene.

08:38.930 --> 08:39.999
Oh.

08:40.600 --> 08:41.806
I'm so sorry.

08:42.770 --> 08:45.512
His dying wish was to stop the casino.

08:47.230 --> 08:48.720
I intend to honor that.

08:51.730 --> 08:53.061
I don't understand.

08:53.150 --> 08:55.983
Jacob was always committed
to making the casino work.

08:56.820 --> 08:58.060
He had an epiphany.

09:02.160 --> 09:04.242
-He passed this morning?
-That's right.

09:04.330 --> 09:05.570
And you came right here?

09:10.460 --> 09:11.836
May I ask how he died?

09:12.630 --> 09:15.508
His heart. It failed him.

09:18.090 --> 09:19.466
Just to be clear...

09:20.720 --> 09:23.769
Jacob understood
that this casino is happening.

09:24.680 --> 09:26.341
There's no way for you to win.

09:27.230 --> 09:29.801
Did the Viet Cong have to win?

09:31.270 --> 09:32.976
-I'm sorry.
-The gooks.

09:33.400 --> 09:34.776
They didn't have to win.

09:35.360 --> 09:38.158
They just had to not lose. It's my land.

09:38.240 --> 09:40.151
The cartel's already tried
to kill you once.

09:40.780 --> 09:42.532
-Is that a threat?
-Just a fact.

09:44.910 --> 09:49.665
There might be one solution
to honor Jacob's memory.

09:50.540 --> 09:54.124
Is that Mason Young's baby in the car?
It is, isn't it?

09:55.130 --> 09:57.758
Social Services told me_
you were looking after him

09:57.840 --> 10:00.217
until they found a suitable home.

10:00.300 --> 10:03.884
Now, you help me adopt him,
and I'll stand aside.

10:03.970 --> 10:05.972
You are not fucking touching that baby.

10:06.060 --> 10:08.437
I delivered that child.

10:09.520 --> 10:10.760
You need to go.

10:12.110 --> 10:13.816
He's not your kin.

10:13.900 --> 10:16.437
He's not worth the cost you'll pay.

10:17.360 --> 10:18.440
Now.

10:48.520 --> 10:50.090
[knock on door]

10:55.230 --> 10:56.470
[Ruth] What the hell do you want?

10:59.240 --> 11:00.855
I need a favor, baby girl.

11:01.860 --> 11:04.408
If anybody asks,
I was here with you all morning.

11:06.080 --> 11:09.243
-What the fuck did you do?
-You don't worry about that, okay?

11:09.830 --> 11:12.913
I just need you to be ready
to alibi me up, just in case.

11:13.380 --> 11:14.870
Like when you robbed my strip club?

11:14.960 --> 11:17.622
Right. That was wrong of me.

11:17.710 --> 11:20.258
I was angry,
and I shouldn't have done that.

11:20.880 --> 11:21.926
You made it real clear

11:22.010 --> 11:24.752
that you don't want me
to be a part of your shit no more.

11:24.850 --> 11:27.250
Well, guess what. This is your shit.

11:28.520 --> 11:29.589
I did it for you.

11:33.230 --> 11:34.606
What are you talking about?

11:34.690 --> 11:37.853
That fed, the one that got you tortured,

11:39.190 --> 11:40.817
he's done fucking with you, girl.

11:42.700 --> 11:44.611
Tell me you didn't kill a fucking fed.

11:44.780 --> 11:46.941
It was an accident. I...

11:47.370 --> 11:50.191
He was talking about sending you
to prison.I lost my temper.

11:50.790 --> 11:52.530
Fuck. Jesus Christ.

11:53.120 --> 11:56.339
I need your help really bad, Ruthie.

12:00.380 --> 12:02.007
Did anybody see you?

12:02.090 --> 12:05.048
It was early. Down by the river
where Russ used to fish.

12:07.600 --> 12:08.589
Is he still there?

12:09.310 --> 12:10.595
I sunk the body.

12:14.480 --> 12:16.357
You didn't touch nothing, did you?

12:17.110 --> 12:18.566
What about his car?

12:18.650 --> 12:21.528
I left it. There's no reason for anybody
to guess I was ever there.

12:21.940 --> 12:26.559
You don't think when they find the car,
an FBI agent's car,

12:26.660 --> 12:29.117
they're not gonna come looking
for the family

12:29.200 --> 12:31.156
of his dead fucking informant?

12:31.250 --> 12:33.070
Which is why I need an alibi!

12:38.710 --> 12:40.246
This is your life.

12:42.010 --> 12:43.580
It ain't fucking mine.

12:50.850 --> 12:52.090
Fuck, Ruthie... You...

12:53.430 --> 12:55.227
Come out here right now, girl.

12:55.310 --> 12:56.470
You hear me, girl?

12:57.440 --> 12:58.759
Don't you fucking do this!

12:59.730 --> 13:02.392
I'm your father! Fuck!

13:08.410 --> 13:10.321
[Marty] Byrde. B-y-r-d-e.

13:11.870 --> 13:12.859
[man] There you are.

13:12.950 --> 13:15.919
[Marty] Uh, so, you know, sir,
we were never intending

13:16.000 --> 13:17.536
on being a long-term family.

13:17.630 --> 13:18.870
We were just doing a friend a favor.

13:19.500 --> 13:20.910
You know, Mason Young.

13:21.000 --> 13:24.879
And now it seems pretty clear
that he has abandoned his child,

13:25.550 --> 13:28.383
so we were thinking
that maybe it would be good to, you know,

13:28.470 --> 13:34.841
get the kid in with an incredibly loving,
stable couple, right away.

13:34.930 --> 13:38.514
Well, I must say, I really do appreciate
your care and commitment.

13:39.270 --> 13:41.067
Yeah. So, possible?

13:41.150 --> 13:42.811
-Oh, absolutely.
-That's great.

13:42.900 --> 13:46.563
We'll have him placed in,
I'd say, six to eight weeks.

13:48.450 --> 13:49.439
Hmm.

13:51.280 --> 13:53.612
-Six to eight.
-Well, ten, tops.

13:53.700 --> 13:54.689
[sighs]

13:56.000 --> 14:01.370
What if I was to, say,
get transferred to another country?

14:02.420 --> 14:03.739
Well, that's not advisable.

14:04.840 --> 14:05.966
Exactly. Yeah.

14:06.050 --> 14:08.336
Which is why
it would just be great

14:08.430 --> 14:12.093
if we could find an amazing family
there on your list

14:12.180 --> 14:16.219
that is looking for a call,
you know, right away.

14:38.910 --> 14:39.911
[tires screech]

14:46.340 --> 14:47.750
Don't make a fuss.

14:52.340 --> 14:53.170
Wendy. Wendy?

14:59.350 --> 15:00.385
Where is he?

15:01.060 --> 15:02.049
Did they shave it all off?

15:04.440 --> 15:05.725
It's okay. I'm not hurt.

15:12.740 --> 15:13.809
[Marty sighs]

15:15.450 --> 15:16.656
It was just a message.

15:23.420 --> 15:25.832
Mrs. Snell says
that you know what she wants.

15:27.920 --> 15:30.081
I'm gonna have him lie down
for a little bit and get some rest.

15:30.670 --> 15:31.876
Come on, let's go to your room.

15:54.450 --> 15:56.441
[typing]

16:03.370 --> 16:04.371
[cell phone chimes]

16:47.840 --> 16:49.034
Do you need help?

17:22.490 --> 17:24.196
[Zeke crying]

17:27.120 --> 17:28.417
Did I wake you up?

17:29.920 --> 17:30.784
Huh?

17:30.880 --> 17:32.757
Hey. Hey.

17:32.840 --> 17:35.627
-[crying continues]
-Shh.

17:35.720 --> 17:37.335
Oh, that's some grip.

17:37.430 --> 17:40.388
You got a real grip there. Come here.

17:41.350 --> 17:43.511
Okay. [shushing].

17:57.200 --> 17:58.849
I don't know how to protect you.

17:58.950 --> 18:00.486
[Zeke cooing]

18:06.870 --> 18:08.246
[man] He was a good man.

18:09.040 --> 18:09.950
[Darlene] Mmm.

18:10.040 --> 18:11.496
[woman] We were luclq to know him.

18:13.460 --> 18:16.338
Well, he loved the both of you.

18:29.060 --> 18:30.687
How you holding up, sweetie?

18:30.770 --> 18:32.510
[breathes deeply]

18:33.270 --> 18:35.352
I smell him on my skin,

18:36.280 --> 18:39.989
but I can't shower
because I'm afraid it might wash off.

18:41.410 --> 18:42.308
[chuckles]

18:42.410 --> 18:44.321
And then a little while ago,

18:45.740 --> 18:47.696
I started a conversation,

18:48.540 --> 18:52.499
and then I realized
I was just talking to myself.

18:52.580 --> 18:54.127
So, I don't know.

18:54.880 --> 18:56.836
[stammers] How am I?

18:56.920 --> 18:58.080
Oh, baby.

19:10.390 --> 19:11.971
I spoke to Social Services.

19:13.190 --> 19:15.067
You're on a list to foster a child,

19:15.150 --> 19:19.689
so the state is approving you
to take Zeke temporarily.

19:20.240 --> 19:24.529
I'm not interested in fostering.
I want to adopt.

19:25.410 --> 19:26.866
The foster agreement comes with a clause

19:26.950 --> 19:29.248
saying that you can
formally adopt the child

19:29.330 --> 19:33.664
if no parent comes forward
to make a claim in the next two years.

19:33.750 --> 19:36.298
And if Mason comes back into the picture?

19:38.800 --> 19:41.041
You have to trust me
that that's not gonna happen.

19:42.380 --> 19:44.007
[Zeke cooing]

19:46.510 --> 19:49.422
You ever touch either one of my children
ever again,

19:51.100 --> 19:52.135
I'll fucking kill you.

19:55.560 --> 19:56.640
I'm so sorry.

19:58.440 --> 20:00.431
[Zeke crying]

20:01.860 --> 20:02.906
Hello.

20:03.660 --> 20:04.866
Hello, baby.

20:06.030 --> 20:07.440
[sighs]

20:07.530 --> 20:13.787
I am gonna love this baby
more than you ever possibly could.

20:16.460 --> 20:17.336
Hello.

20:18.300 --> 20:19.665
You're home now.

20:20.760 --> 20:21.579
Yeah.

20:22.300 --> 20:23.790
Hello, young man.

20:37.650 --> 20:39.641
-This your vehicle?
-Yes, sir.

20:39.730 --> 20:40.890
Park closes at sunset.

20:42.190 --> 20:44.238
I was scouting fishing spots

20:44.320 --> 20:47.733
and seeing how the water was running,
and I lost track of light.

20:49.410 --> 20:51.446
Just vacate the park, please.

21:01.000 --> 21:03.127
[rock music playing]

21:03.220 --> 21:05.927
Since when do rich girls
know their way around a grill?

21:07.140 --> 21:08.380
Since fuck you.

21:10.010 --> 21:12.592
Hey, I was thinking, uh,

21:13.310 --> 21:16.848
maybe you should move into Wyatt's room
after he takes off for Mizzou.

21:19.150 --> 21:21.721
You know, I was actually thinking
about coming to Columbia with you.

21:22.940 --> 21:26.068
I don't know. I need to finish out
my senior year, and we can get a place.

21:27.200 --> 21:28.861
[car approaching]

21:39.920 --> 21:41.490
I need to talk to you.

21:43.010 --> 21:44.659
What the fuck are you all looking at?

21:44.760 --> 21:47.502
Go inside. Mind your own fucking business.

21:48.720 --> 21:50.381
Fucking now, girl.

21:53.890 --> 21:55.972
[Wyatt] How about I call you
when things calm down around here?

21:56.060 --> 21:57.379
[Charlotte] What, you don't wanna
come with me?

21:57.480 --> 22:00.722
I wanna stick around for Ruth.
I'll be fine. Talk to you later, okay?

22:00.810 --> 22:01.640
Okay.

22:08.740 --> 22:10.059
I need money.

22:10.160 --> 22:13.072
I told you,
I don't know where Marty stashes it.

22:13.160 --> 22:15.401
You forget about that. Anything you got.

22:15.500 --> 22:17.741
I moved that fed's car,
and it's your fault.

22:18.710 --> 22:23.204
I moved it, and when I come back,
that ranger was there, took down my plate.

22:24.380 --> 22:26.257
When they find that car, he's gonna know.

22:26.340 --> 22:30.299
It might be days, might be a week,
a month, I don't know.

22:30.390 --> 22:34.554
But they're gonna find that fucking car,
and they're gonna come looking for me...

22:35.270 --> 22:36.919
and I better be fucking gone.

22:38.060 --> 22:40.688
The only money I got is
for Wyatt's tuition.

22:41.520 --> 22:43.260
Well, then you're gonna give it to me.

22:44.690 --> 22:45.679
No.

22:46.360 --> 22:47.850
You're gonna give it to me,

22:48.780 --> 22:49.986
or I'm gonna walk over there

22:50.070 --> 22:52.903
and I'm gonna tell him
exactly what happened to his daddy.

23:30.780 --> 23:33.817
Three, I need you to fuck off.
I need to talk to Wyatt alone.

23:39.910 --> 23:41.411
And turn up the TV loud.

23:46.920 --> 23:49.753
-What did Cade say?
-This ain't about Cade.

23:50.670 --> 23:53.468
-Okay, what's up?
-I need you to listen to me.

24:01.270 --> 24:04.854
I know Marty didn't kill your dad...

24:08.280 --> 24:09.565
because I did.

24:14.530 --> 24:15.906
What are you talking about?

24:16.740 --> 24:18.071
I wired the dock.

24:18.870 --> 24:21.862
I knew that they were going there,
so I wired it, so the second they touched the ladder,
they'd get electrocuted.

24:26.330 --> 24:27.786
You're making this up.

24:28.880 --> 24:30.086
Why would I be doing that?

24:30.170 --> 24:31.250
You're afraid I won't go to Mizzou

24:31.340 --> 24:32.750
if I don't find out
what happened to my dad,

24:32.840 --> 24:34.376
and now you're
just fucking making this up!

24:34.470 --> 24:38.133
I wish I was. I wish to fucking God...
I wish it was a lie.

24:40.680 --> 24:45.515
Russ was working with the feds.
He was trying to get me on a wire.

24:45.600 --> 24:48.057
No. No way. No fucking way!

24:48.150 --> 24:51.734
You were right about that night.
They had the guns.

24:53.860 --> 24:55.521
They were gonna kill Marty.

24:59.240 --> 25:03.495
I practiced on our dock, with a mouse.

25:04.410 --> 25:09.029
At first,
I rigged Marty's dock to get him,

25:10.380 --> 25:13.543
but then it was fucked up and...

25:15.130 --> 25:19.214
things changed,
and they were going to the Blue Cat.

25:23.980 --> 25:25.550
Say something.

25:29.110 --> 25:32.648
[stammers] You can hate me,
and I know you will.

25:36.820 --> 25:39.402
But I need you to know that you're the...

25:41.660 --> 25:45.869
you're the only thing in this world
that I'll ever fucking love.

25:45.960 --> 25:47.951
[sobbing]

25:49.330 --> 25:50.536
[Wyatt sighs]

26:25.950 --> 26:27.247
Jonah's still asleep.

26:31.500 --> 26:33.127
Marty, are you all right? What's going on?

26:37.510 --> 26:39.000
Where's Zeke?

26:39.720 --> 26:40.960
What have you done?

26:41.050 --> 26:42.426
I'm just trying to save us, Wendy.

26:43.100 --> 26:44.089
Get him back.

26:44.810 --> 26:47.802
And then what? Wait_for Dar_lene
to come after our kids again?

26:47.890 --> 26:50.051
Or have her blow up the casino
and have the cartel come after us?

26:50.150 --> 26:53.768
I mean, what are we supposed to do?
Have her killed?

26:59.150 --> 27:02.734
She touched our child,
and you give her a baby?

27:02.820 --> 27:05.118
-I didn't have a fucking choice, Wendy.
-Of course you did.

27:05.910 --> 27:06.786
We're leaving.

27:07.830 --> 27:11.573
We're leaving the very second that casino
is finalized and the cartel's out of town.

27:11.670 --> 27:12.819
I got a plane standing by.

27:12.920 --> 27:14.740
We wouldn't have been able to
take this baby out of the country

27:14.840 --> 27:16.296
without triggering an AMBER alert.

27:18.210 --> 27:21.213
-You made these plans without me?
-Yeah.

27:24.180 --> 27:26.250
Once the operational account is active,

27:26.350 --> 27:30.309
a tiny percentage is gonna flow
into an encrypted account that I created.

27:31.230 --> 27:34.142
You and the kids are gonna travel
under the Fleming passports,

27:34.230 --> 27:35.857
and a seaplane is gonna
take us to Little Rock,

27:35.940 --> 27:37.100
where I have an identity waiting for me.

27:37.190 --> 27:38.817
And after Little Rock,
we can go to Costa Rica,

27:38.900 --> 27:40.697
and after Costa Rica,
we're going to Australia.

27:43.320 --> 27:44.696
We're going to the Gold Coast.

27:46.200 --> 27:48.748
A surrogate there is gonna pay
for the housing and utilities

27:48.830 --> 27:51.242
so that nothing is even under
our fake identities.

27:51.330 --> 27:53.958
We're gonna be two layers removed
from any detection.

27:55.670 --> 27:58.582
And this surrogate,
you've actually already found him?

27:59.800 --> 28:01.677
-I'm gonna do that when we get there.
-Hmm.

28:02.510 --> 28:05.593
And if the cartel reviews the accounts
before that happens?

28:06.010 --> 28:08.137
I taught Ruth how to do the books.
She knows how to move the money.

28:09.890 --> 28:12.347
So you were never really trying
to make any of this work.

28:16.110 --> 28:19.682
I did try to make a lot of it work,
but Charlotte wants to emancipate,

28:19.780 --> 28:22.692
and our son is describing getting
his head shaved by a fucking lunatic

28:22.780 --> 28:25.613
as just a message, like it's normal?

28:28.160 --> 28:30.446
[breathes deeply]

28:32.290 --> 28:33.450
Nothing's working.

28:42.920 --> 28:44.217
We have two problems.

28:45.180 --> 28:49.002
The casino might fail,
and our family's falling apart.

28:50.310 --> 28:54.019
Giving Darlene that kid is the only way
we were gonna solve both.

28:57.940 --> 29:00.147
Why the fuck didn't you talk to me
about this?

29:04.150 --> 29:05.856
I didn't have time to argue with you.

29:17.290 --> 29:18.279
[sniffles]

29:50.580 --> 29:52.445
So, you said four passengers, Mr. Bennett?

29:52.540 --> 29:56.749
Uh, yes, sir. Two adults and two children.
This'll be able to take all of us, huh?

29:56.830 --> 29:59.572
[man] We're cleared to travel
to Lake Conway. It's near Little Rock.

30:00.250 --> 30:01.956
With the amount of fuel
we'll need to hold,

30:02.050 --> 30:04.166
you'll have to keep it
to two bags per passenger.

30:04.960 --> 30:06.837
I'll have a jeep standing by
on the other side.

30:06.930 --> 30:09.171
Uh, great. I'll bring you the other half
of this tomorrow.

30:09.260 --> 30:10.466
Okay? I'll see you then.

30:18.140 --> 30:19.516
[knock on door]

30:34.660 --> 30:35.820
-Hi.
-[Helen] Hi.

30:36.410 --> 30:39.368
Sorry to intrude.
I know mornings are sacred family time.

30:39.460 --> 30:42.623
No. Actually, Marty's already gone,

30:42.710 --> 30:45.759
and Charlotte was spending the night
at a friend's, so...

30:45.840 --> 30:48.547
-Do you want some coffee?
-Uh, yeah, thank you. Black.

30:53.140 --> 30:54.960
Don't tell me the baby's still asleep.

30:57.100 --> 30:59.056
Social Services found a home for him.

31:00.560 --> 31:02.187
He was with you only yesterday.

31:03.980 --> 31:07.029
-It took us by surprise. But we're...
-Thanks.

31:07.650 --> 31:10.608
We're happy he's finally placed in a...

31:12.490 --> 31:15.618
healthy, permanent situation.

31:17.000 --> 31:17.989
[Helen] Hmm.

31:18.790 --> 31:20.280
[Jonah] Can I go for Buddy's old walk?

31:21.670 --> 31:22.568
[Wendy] No further.

31:24.920 --> 31:25.739
Morning.

31:28.590 --> 31:30.546
Teenagers. [chuckles]

31:36.810 --> 31:39.301
Jacob Snell is dead. Did you know?

31:40.310 --> 31:41.800
Darlene came by yesterday.

31:43.730 --> 31:44.799
Do we have a problem?

31:46.690 --> 31:47.816
It's taken care of.

31:50.820 --> 31:52.026
[Helen laughs]

31:52.160 --> 31:56.278
I was serious, you know,
when I said how impressed my client is.

31:57.910 --> 32:01.038
I have to say, when the idea
of a casino was first floated,

32:01.120 --> 32:03.202
neither of us thought
you had a chance in hell.

32:04.500 --> 32:06.707
My client even had us monitor
your every move.

32:06.790 --> 32:09.372
Your purchases, your browser history.

32:10.920 --> 32:15.505
He was convinced that once it became clear
that the casmo was a loser,

32:16.180 --> 32:19.889
you'd have to make a run for it.
And yet, here we are.

32:19.970 --> 32:20.971
[Wendy] Hmm.

32:23.390 --> 32:25.608
I've been particularly impressed with you.

32:30.900 --> 32:31.980
I appreciate that.

32:33.110 --> 32:35.567
It's not easy navigating this world
as a woman.

32:36.700 --> 32:40.329
You must be happy to be going home
to Chicago? See your family?

32:41.120 --> 32:42.860
-The children, yeah.
-Hmm.

32:42.960 --> 32:44.530
The divorce attorney? Hmm.

32:45.630 --> 32:46.779
I'm sorry.

32:46.880 --> 32:49.041
Like I said, it's not easy navigating.

32:53.470 --> 32:55.586
So, where is Marty
this early in the morning?

32:55.680 --> 32:59.218
Oh, he's just off shoring up
a few last details.

33:00.720 --> 33:01.550
How is he?

33:01.640 --> 33:02.766
-He's good.
-Good.

33:06.940 --> 33:10.319
You know, you really should think about
what you want out of your new situation.

33:11.150 --> 33:11.980
I have.

33:12.860 --> 33:16.193
-And what is it you want?
-Your gratitude.

33:16.530 --> 33:17.736
Well, you have that.

33:19.950 --> 33:20.780
[chuckles]

33:22.000 --> 33:23.615
And that is a powerful thing.

33:29.710 --> 33:32.338
-Tell Marty I'm sorry I missed him.
-I will.

33:45.440 --> 33:46.589
[door opens]

33:50.440 --> 33:55.480
Hey. Frank. How you doing?
Something I can help you with?

33:56.070 --> 33:58.061
[Frank] I've been hearing things. [sighs]

33:58.160 --> 33:59.616
"Things"? What kind of things?

34:00.120 --> 34:02.190
[sighs] Don't try my patience.

34:03.080 --> 34:05.787
I don't like playing games
any more than I like driving three hours

34:05.870 --> 34:08.327
to a fucking lake
in the middle of the off-season.

34:09.290 --> 34:12.703
If you're talking about the union,
um, it's true that I had to strike a deal,

34:12.800 --> 34:14.506
but I promise you,
all your guys are gonna get hired.

34:14.590 --> 34:15.625
I don't want you to worry.

34:17.010 --> 34:18.625
-But I am worried.
-Don't.

34:19.590 --> 34:22.559
Do you think I'm someone
that you can fuck with?

34:23.720 --> 34:24.550
Come on.

34:25.850 --> 34:32.016
Do you think the gaming commission
thinks I'm someone who they can fuck with?

34:34.070 --> 34:38.279
I do not. And I can't imagine
that they think that.

34:38.360 --> 34:40.692
Then why are you letting them
fuck with me, Marty?

34:40.780 --> 34:42.987
Frank, I told you that your guys
are gonna get taken care of.

34:44.620 --> 34:45.609
They're gonna get taken care of.

34:45.700 --> 34:48.077
We're gonna make sure
the union rolls stay high.

34:49.420 --> 34:50.876
Because you know my business.

34:51.960 --> 34:52.779
Yeah.

34:52.880 --> 34:55.292
Do you really think there's an angle
in the gaming industry

34:55.380 --> 34:57.371
-that I haven't seen?
-No.

34:58.800 --> 35:00.961
Do you honestly believe

35:01.970 --> 35:07.010
that a handshake agreement with you
is the end of our discussions?

35:09.100 --> 35:13.685
What do I have to do
to make you take me seriously?

35:14.320 --> 35:17.232
Is this fun for you?
Are you having a fucking good time?

35:17.320 --> 35:18.890
What's the plan here?
What's this guy gonna do?

35:18.990 --> 35:21.151
Are you gonna kill me,
or fucking beat me up or something?

35:21.240 --> 35:22.446
Is this guy here to send me a message?

35:22.530 --> 35:24.907
How about you just get the fuck out
of here and let me do my job?

35:25.660 --> 35:27.446
All right? Because without those deals,
there'd be no casino,

35:27.540 --> 35:30.156
which means there'd be no jobs
for your guys at all.

35:30.250 --> 35:31.205
Is that what you want?

35:31.790 --> 35:34.953
How about you just give me the freedom
to do my fucking job?

35:36.420 --> 35:37.626
That's all I'm doing.

35:47.890 --> 35:49.380
Place smells like a new car.

35:52.150 --> 35:53.219
Just moved in.

36:10.000 --> 36:12.537
-Have you seen Wyatt?
-Thought he was with you.

36:12.620 --> 36:14.997
No, I've been worried
'cause I've been calling him all night

36:15.080 --> 36:15.910
and he hasn't picked up his phone.

36:16.000 --> 36:17.740
[Cade] Did you really buy that van
with your own money?

36:19.420 --> 36:20.580
-Yeah.
-Yea h?

36:20.670 --> 36:22.422
You sure it wasn't your daddy's money?

36:22.510 --> 36:24.967
The money he's got hidden
around here somewheres?

36:25.600 --> 36:27.136
[Charlotte] I don't know
what you're talking about.

36:27.220 --> 36:30.303
-I think you're lying to me, little girl.
-I'm not.

36:30.390 --> 36:32.722
-Hey. You're scaring her, Uncle Cade.
-Stay out of this, boy.

36:34.520 --> 36:36.681
If you called your daddy right now
and told him you needed money,

36:36.770 --> 36:37.646
would he give it to you?

36:37.730 --> 36:39.812
-I'm not talking to my parents right now.
-Bullshit.

36:39.900 --> 36:40.730
She's telling the truth.

36:41.820 --> 36:42.775
[Cade] Stay out of it.

36:44.950 --> 36:46.269
[Charlotte screaming]

36:47.870 --> 36:49.360
[Cade] Where do you think
you're going, girl?

36:49.450 --> 36:50.576
-[Charlotte continues screaming]
-[shotgun cocks]

36:50.660 --> 36:51.490
[Ruth] Let her go.

36:51.580 --> 36:52.569
[groaning]

36:53.250 --> 36:55.206
I seem to remember_
what happened the last tIme

36:55.290 --> 36:57.246
you tried to pull a gun on me, baby girl.

37:00.300 --> 37:01.369
Get in the car.

37:02.090 --> 37:05.503
Three, get in the trailer.
Lock the door until he cools off.

37:27.490 --> 37:28.900
Do you know where Wyatt is?

37:32.040 --> 37:33.246
He left last night.

37:40.250 --> 37:41.581
Is he coming back?

37:48.640 --> 37:50.255
I don't know. [clears throat]

38:03.440 --> 38:04.771
[Wendy] Are you okay?

38:07.990 --> 38:09.617
I'm so sorry.

38:11.700 --> 38:14.282
Please do not leave me again.
I can't protect you if you do.

38:15.370 --> 38:16.780
I haven't changed my mind,

38:17.750 --> 38:19.786
but is it okay if I go sleep
in my own bed?

38:19.880 --> 38:22.838
Of course. Of course.

38:29.340 --> 38:30.887
Ruth. Where are you going?

38:32.140 --> 38:32.959
Home.

38:33.640 --> 38:35.801
-Is Cade there?
-Yeah.

38:36.770 --> 38:37.759
You're staying here.

38:44.280 --> 38:46.180
What the hell did you do?

38:47.280 --> 38:48.190
It's cancer.

38:49.740 --> 38:51.196
You've been gone a while.

38:51.780 --> 38:54.078
[scoffs, sniffles]

38:54.950 --> 38:55.996
[Charlotte sighs]

38:59.870 --> 39:01.701
You are an asshole.

39:01.790 --> 39:02.950
[Jonah chuckles]

39:03.040 --> 39:04.746
[Wendy] How worried
do we have to be about Cade?

39:05.340 --> 39:07.501
Do you think
he'll go after Charlotte again?

39:07.590 --> 39:10.923
I don't know.
He's hell-bent on finding your money.

39:12.220 --> 39:13.676
Well, I trust that
that's not gonna happen.

39:16.270 --> 39:18.261
[ragged breathing]

39:19.140 --> 39:23.429
I mean, even if he runs away,
he'll still come back.

39:26.610 --> 39:27.929
He's my dad.

39:29.820 --> 39:31.447
I can't make him stop.

39:34.370 --> 39:35.485
I understand.

39:36.740 --> 39:38.742
[whirring]

39:49.630 --> 39:50.961
[cell phone ringing]

39:52.220 --> 39:53.255
[Jonah] You should take that.

40:00.600 --> 40:01.476
[Charlotte] Hi.

40:04.270 --> 40:05.430
Yeah, sorry I haven't called back.

40:05.520 --> 40:09.069
Ijust, um... Ijust had some shit
I need to figure out.

40:09.690 --> 40:12.693
Ruth said that you might be
leaving for good. Is that true?

40:15.570 --> 40:16.650
[Wyatt] I'm not sure.

40:19.500 --> 40:20.694
Did she say anything else?

40:21.620 --> 40:22.450
/V0.

40:26.920 --> 40:29.297
Were you serious about moving to Columbia?

40:35.260 --> 40:36.249
It's okay.

40:38.350 --> 40:39.465
I'm at my parents'.

40:42.100 --> 40:43.840
[inhales] Are you staying?

40:45.650 --> 40:47.015
[scoffs] I'm not sure, either.

40:51.110 --> 40:53.601
Hey, I think you should know. Um...

40:56.370 --> 40:58.656
I found out your dad didn't kill anyone.

41:00.540 --> 41:01.359
Positive?

41:02.460 --> 41:05.748
Yeah. Uh, I'll call you later, okay?

41:10.800 --> 41:12.119
[sighs]

41:12.210 --> 41:13.962
That was the right thing to do.

41:17.510 --> 41:19.671
You lied to me about killing Marty.

41:23.890 --> 41:25.300
I was trying to protect you.

41:30.690 --> 41:32.226
So, now you know.

41:34.950 --> 41:36.599
What are you gonna do about it?

41:38.570 --> 41:39.867
[exhales]

41:42.580 --> 41:44.207
I'm not gonna tell Three.

41:47.120 --> 41:48.917
If you don't wanna, don't.

41:51.880 --> 41:54.292
Your judgment always was better than mine.

41:58.720 --> 42:00.039
I still love you.

42:05.270 --> 42:06.635
You fucking better.

42:07.690 --> 42:08.975
[sniffles]

42:09.770 --> 42:10.759
I'm just... [exhales]

42:14.650 --> 42:17.232
I'm afraid I'm going insane.

42:19.490 --> 42:22.197
[stammers] I don't know what to think
about anything anymore.

42:22.280 --> 42:24.578
About Ruth, college, any of it.

42:25.540 --> 42:28.577
One moment, I wanna fucking smash
everything to little pieces,

42:28.670 --> 42:31.742
and then the next, I wanna pretend
like none of it ever happened.

42:34.960 --> 42:36.291
I don't know what to do.

42:45.060 --> 42:46.550
[Wendy] She needs protection.

42:47.430 --> 42:51.639
Yeah, well, um, what if we paid Cade
to leave town?

42:51.730 --> 42:52.640
You know?

42:52.730 --> 42:57.064
Otherwise, she'd just be too vulnerable
once she takes over the money.

42:59.740 --> 43:01.025
-Yeah.
-Yea h?

43:02.240 --> 43:07.109
I've also been thinking that we should
tell the kids that we're leaving tomorrow.

43:07.200 --> 43:09.077
No. Unh-unh.

43:09.580 --> 43:11.286
They've each been through a huge trauma.

43:11.380 --> 43:13.951
I don't wanna risk them being
too emotional, tipping our hand.

43:19.470 --> 43:21.631
Yeah. Should we go inside?

43:22.550 --> 43:24.632
No, I'm gonna stay out here
a few more minutes.

43:27.270 --> 43:30.262
-You okay? Got a pillow?
-Yeah. Yeah.

43:30.350 --> 43:31.180
[Marty] Good night.

43:41.610 --> 43:42.486
[Marty] Good night.

44:01.800 --> 44:02.926
[Wendy] You manage to eat out there?

44:04.090 --> 44:05.671
[Charlotte] I'm not helpless.

44:05.760 --> 44:07.716
I mean, if you're sleeping in a van...

44:08.390 --> 44:11.268
Look, all I'm saying is,
there's plenty, so eat up.

44:13.230 --> 44:15.642
Ruth, get on over here.

44:22.740 --> 44:24.196
So, is this one of those ceremonies

44:24.280 --> 44:27.829
that they, uh, christen the boat
with a bottle of champagne?

44:28.490 --> 44:31.493
I think that's just for ships
that are set to sail.

44:32.750 --> 44:34.786
Well, technically it could,
if you wanted it to.

44:34.880 --> 44:36.620
Not the way I fucking found it.

44:41.800 --> 44:42.619
So, uh...

44:43.970 --> 44:48.213
does this happen, like, every day?

44:48.640 --> 44:50.801
Unless we're on the run.
Then we eat In the car.

44:50.890 --> 44:52.801
-[chuckles]
-That's not funny.

44:54.060 --> 44:55.186
It was a little funny.

44:55.270 --> 44:59.309
Uh, the ceremony is to officially declare
the casino approved.

44:59.400 --> 45:01.186
Then it's down to work after that.

45:04.070 --> 45:05.025
Wait, where's Zeke?

45:06.280 --> 45:07.907
The state found a very nice home for him.

45:09.870 --> 45:13.112
What, so, that's it?
He just doesn't live with us anymore?

45:13.580 --> 45:15.741
Charlotte, it's the way
it was always supposed to be.

45:21.380 --> 45:22.369
What?

45:24.010 --> 45:27.468
Nothing. I'm just glad you're here.

45:35.310 --> 45:37.016
[Marty] Is any of that confusing?

45:37.100 --> 45:39.182
Once you know the cartel is gone,

45:39.270 --> 45:42.398
I'll take you by boat
to the seaplane at mile 24.

45:42.480 --> 45:45.529
You'll give me a bag, and it'll have
your cell phones and credit cards.

45:45.610 --> 45:48.158
Keep those here at the house.
Drive them around every once in a while.

45:48.240 --> 45:49.480
But, uh, in three weeks,

45:49.580 --> 45:52.652
I want you to pay someone to take them up
to Vancouver and dump them.

45:52.750 --> 45:53.569
And after that's done,

45:53.660 --> 45:56.163
I want you to call Helen
and tell her that we went on vacation

45:56.250 --> 46:00.289
and we haven't come back,
and we're not returning your calls. Okay?

46:00.380 --> 46:02.496
-Okay.
-Thank you.

46:06.130 --> 46:07.586
You're seeing my dad? It's gonna be all right.

46:40.830 --> 46:42.286
And what can I get you, hon?

46:42.380 --> 46:44.291
-Uh, coffee, please.
-Okay.

46:49.930 --> 46:51.386
Public place.

46:52.470 --> 46:55.098
You figure I won't make a scene,
is that it?

46:56.980 --> 46:58.186
You hurt my daughter.

46:59.600 --> 47:02.057
And because of you,
my fucking brothers are dead.

47:03.650 --> 47:08.519
Or does grief only count
when it happens to someone like you?

47:09.150 --> 47:11.482
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

47:11.570 --> 47:12.400
Sure thing.

47:17.120 --> 47:19.611
There's half a million dollars
in that bag on the floor.

47:21.080 --> 47:23.162
It's yours if you leave town immediately.

47:24.340 --> 47:28.128
No going back to the trailers,
no trying to talk to Ruth.

47:29.760 --> 47:33.753
You leave this caf, and you get straight
on a highway out of town.

47:43.730 --> 47:45.015
[opens the bag]

47:51.070 --> 47:53.982
All you people ever understand is money.

47:57.240 --> 47:58.491
Is that a yes?

48:08.090 --> 48:11.674
So, uh, slots are gonna be
on the lower level there.

48:11.760 --> 48:13.421
Because you want people
to have to walk through them

48:13.510 --> 48:14.670
on the way to the other games, right?

48:14.760 --> 48:16.216
Yeah, that's right.

48:16.310 --> 48:18.016
Blackjack and roulette are
on the middle level

48:18.100 --> 48:20.341
and we cover the top
for poker and craps.

48:21.100 --> 48:25.059
-Hi. Everything okay? Yeah? Good.
-Mm-hmm.

48:25.150 --> 48:26.970
[Marty] Mr. Hodges, hello.

48:27.070 --> 48:30.358
-It's about that time. Are you ready?
-About as ready as I'll ever be.

48:30.440 --> 48:31.816
[chuckles] Is this your family?

48:31.900 --> 48:33.982
Yes, this is our daughter Charlotte
and our son Jonah.

48:34.070 --> 48:36.026
This is Mr. Hodges.
He's head of the gaming commission.

48:36.120 --> 48:39.192
You should know your parents are doing
something great here for the community.

48:43.210 --> 48:46.532
-You ready?
-Oh, yes, I am. That's for you, darling.

48:46.630 --> 48:48.621
-Oh, take care.
-Uh-huh. ["Brandy" by Looking Glass

48:54.590 --> 48:55.966
[Cade singing along]

48:56.050 --> 48:59.554
There’s a port on a western bay

48:59.640 --> 49:03.303
And it serves a hundred sh/jos a day

49:03.390 --> 49:07.508
Lone/y sa/70rs pass the time away

49:07.610 --> 49:10.352
And talk about their homes

49:10.940 --> 49:14.853
And there ’5 a girl in this harbor town

49:14.950 --> 49:18.659
And she works lay/n ’ whiskey o’own

49:18.740 --> 49:24.861
They say, ”Brandy, fetch another round ”
She serves them whiskey and wine...

49:24.960 --> 49:26.450
[Cade] You're blocking the fucking road!

49:27.420 --> 49:30.878
Hey, asshole, it's just a dog.
Either leave it or drag it the fuck away.

49:30.960 --> 49:32.871
-[gunshots]
-[song continues playing]

Yeah, your eyes
could steal a sa/ior from the sea

Brandy wears a braided chain

49:45.690 --> 49:49.558

From the north of Spain

49:49.650 --> 49:56.146
A locket that bears the name
Of a man that Brandy /0 ved

49:57.410 --> 50:00.777
He came on a summers day

50:16.880 --> 50:19.212
-We have an issue.
-What type of issue?

50:20.680 --> 50:21.806
A threat.

50:24.140 --> 50:25.846
Before you say anything else,

50:26.350 --> 50:28.181
you might think
this is a simple conversation...

50:28.270 --> 50:29.589
-I don't.
-...but I promise you,

50:29.690 --> 50:31.146
it is more difficult than you comprehend.

50:31.230 --> 50:35.109
Once you tell me something,
it can't be retracted.

50:38.030 --> 50:40.112
I know what you're saying,
and I understand.

50:41.160 --> 50:42.149
No, you don't.

50:43.870 --> 50:45.326
You can't. Not really.

50:47.540 --> 50:48.916
Your whole body changes.

50:49.620 --> 50:51.952
The way you smell, your reflection,

50:52.040 --> 50:54.838
how it feels
when your husband touches you.

50:55.920 --> 50:58.081
That doesn't change the fact
that we still have an issue.

51:27.080 --> 51:28.365
We should take our places.

51:30.750 --> 51:31.819
We're not running.

51:32.580 --> 51:33.410
What do you mean?

51:34.130 --> 51:36.337
We're not leaving the Ozarks.
It's not safe to go.

51:39.420 --> 51:40.876
Wendy, it's not safe to stay.

51:42.510 --> 51:46.514
You're not acting out of logic.
You're acting out of emotion.

51:46.600 --> 51:50.479
And I know I've asked you to be
more emotional. I've begged.

51:50.560 --> 51:52.187
So, I love you for it,

51:52.270 --> 51:55.068
but I am not getting on that plane
and neither are the kids.

51:55.150 --> 51:56.856
Okay, you're just scared.

51:57.440 --> 51:59.271
Don't worry about it.
I've got everything under control.

51:59.360 --> 52:00.691
-No, you don't.
-Yes, I do.

52:00.780 --> 52:01.690
Unh-unh.

52:03.070 --> 52:04.947
You're running away from Mason's death.

52:05.030 --> 52:07.328
You're trying to kidnap Charlotte
so she can't leave the family.

52:07.410 --> 52:09.401
And you were right all along.

52:09.500 --> 52:12.788
We can't make emotional decisions
based on other people's ch0|ces.

52:12.870 --> 52:17.910
So we just have to wake up and make
the right choices for us and our kids.

52:18.000 --> 52:21.629
And right now, that means staying put.

52:23.430 --> 52:26.502
You're telling me this now? Here?

52:27.930 --> 52:29.557
I didn't have time to argue.

52:35.610 --> 52:37.009
[clears throat]

52:52.210 --> 52:53.495
Call the coroner's office.

52:56.290 --> 52:57.621
This is not sustainable.

52:57.710 --> 53:02.625
What, and running is? Hiring surrogates?
Changing identities?

53:05.970 --> 53:08.552
-What if this is the Gold Coast?
-It's not.

53:08.640 --> 53:09.629
[Wendy] Hmm.

53:10.520 --> 53:12.135
We only know what it's been.

53:13.640 --> 53:15.096
What about what it could be?

53:16.020 --> 53:17.305
I mean, you've said so yourself,

53:17.400 --> 53:19.937
once the casino is up and running,
it's like clockwork.

53:20.690 --> 53:22.521
You could go back
to just working the numbers.

53:22.610 --> 53:25.022
The kids are in school. We have roots.

53:25.110 --> 53:28.022
We've sacriﬁced too fucking much
in order to run.

53:28.120 --> 53:30.691
We will get that baby away
from Darlene. Don't worry.

53:30.790 --> 53:31.779
And what about the Kansas City mob?

53:31.870 --> 53:35.783
Wendy, I played a game of fucking chicken
with them because I knew we were running.

53:36.250 --> 53:37.911
We're not alone here.

53:39.790 --> 53:43.374
We have partners who are very grateful
for what we've done.

53:46.340 --> 53:48.342
Always better to be
the person holding the gun

53:48.430 --> 53:50.216
than the one running from the gunman.

53:50.310 --> 53:52.301
[Hodges over microphone] If you could
all take your seats, please.

54:10.830 --> 54:13.037
What were you and Mom talking about?

54:16.160 --> 54:19.914
Do you still wanna be emancipated?
Because if you do, I won't fight it.

54:20.000 --> 54:22.742
[Hodges] All right.
I wanna thank you all for coming.

54:22.840 --> 54:25.001
It's a great day in the Ozarks.

54:25.090 --> 54:25.909
As you know,

54:26.010 --> 54:29.673
the legislature recently decided
to grant a 14th casino license,

54:29.760 --> 54:32.388
and I'm thrilled to announce
that it will live here,

54:32.470 --> 54:35.348
smack dab in the heart of Missouri.

54:35.980 --> 54:37.015
So, without further ado,

54:37.100 --> 54:39.432
I'd like to introduce the man
who got us unstuck

54:39.520 --> 54:42.933
from that unlucky 13, Marty Byrde.

54:49.240 --> 54:50.730
[Marty over microphone]
Thank you very much.

54:51.410 --> 54:52.980
Up until a very short time ago,

54:53.080 --> 54:55.742
I wasn't sure what life
was about to look like.

55:02.000 --> 55:03.831
My family and I came here to the Ozarks

55:03.920 --> 55:08.289
to escape our old life in Chicago
and start a new one.

55:08.380 --> 55:09.836
And now here we are.

55:11.300 --> 55:15.339
Our kids are in school,
we have started businesses,

55:16.020 --> 55:19.092
we have even buried someone...

55:23.730 --> 55:25.561
very dear to our family.

55:25.650 --> 55:29.734
And for all of these reasons,
we are now a part of the land here,

55:30.780 --> 55:34.773
and there is a permanence to our life
that we simply cannot undo.

55:37.250 --> 55:40.708
It has made me reevaluate
what it means to be a husband

55:41.790 --> 55:45.294
and to be a father and to be a neighbor.

55:45.380 --> 55:50.170
[Darlene]
I keep a close watch
On this heart of mine

55:50.840 --> 55:56.051
I keep my eyes wide open all the t/me

55:56.890 --> 55:58.266
-[continues singing]
{Martyi
I’ve realized that

55:58.350 --> 56:01.899
what holds everything together is trust;
and I would l/ke to take this opportunity

56:01.980 --> 56:04.551
to thank you people here in the Ozarks...

56:04.650 --> 56:06.561
-for trusting us.
- Because you ’re mine

56:07.320 --> 56:09.356
I walk the line

56:11.110 --> 56:12.657
[Darlene continues humming]

56:22.830 --> 56:26.414
[Ma/1y]
Someone recently told me
that; standing in this very spot

56:26.500 --> 56:28.331
I would be able to see my future.

56:31.590 --> 56:34.002
I understand now how true that is.

56:35.220 --> 56:40.476
I hope a lot of you have the same sense
of what is on the way.

56:45.810 --> 56:46.890
7'0 prosperity.

57:01.250 --> 57:03.992
I need you to know,
I understand why you might wanna leave.

57:04.870 --> 57:07.748
And maybe we're never gonna be
the kind of family

57:08.380 --> 57:10.792
who listens to_ music
and Sings Into haIrbrushes,

57:12.420 --> 57:13.876
but we're still a family.

57:15.260 --> 57:18.002
And your father and I love you
more than anything in the world.

57:19.260 --> 57:21.091
And there was a time
when I wanted to leave, too.

57:21.180 --> 57:24.183
And, yes, I had an affair.

57:25.980 --> 57:30.644
And I did it because
I wanted to be someone else.

57:30.730 --> 57:32.186
I wanted to live a different life.

57:32.280 --> 57:35.022
And I was so wrong.

57:37.280 --> 57:41.649
Because this is who I am
and this is who I wanna be.

57:45.000 --> 57:46.456
Just think about it.

57:47.830 --> 57:48.660
Okay?

58:06.770 --> 58:09.227
You don't have to do this right now
if you don't want.

58:10.400 --> 58:11.310
I know.

58:20.330 --> 58:21.399
That's him.

58:24.500 --> 58:30.666
Can you give me a minute, maybe? Alone?

58:31.590 --> 58:34.457
Yeah, of course. Absolutely.

59:06.620 --> 59:07.609
[sniffles]

59:18.630 --> 59:20.120
[sniffles]

59:52.960 --> 59:54.245
Goodbye, Daddy. [sniffles]

59:55.710 --> 59:58.122
Can I get a photo of the whole family? In one second.
I just have to say hi to somebody.

1:00:00.720 --> 1:00:01.675
-Sure. Mm-hmm.
-Pardon me.

1:00:01.760 --> 1:00:02.749
Oh.

1:00:04.970 --> 1:00:06.380
Congratulations.

1:00:06.470 --> 1:00:08.802
You must be excited
to get back to Chicago.

1:00:09.180 --> 1:00:12.013
The car's already gassed. Not that I have
anything against this place.

1:00:12.100 --> 1:00:14.182
It's just, you know,
I hate this fucking place.

1:00:17.230 --> 1:00:21.018
You should know,
I had word from my associate,

1:00:21.110 --> 1:00:23.021
Ruth Langmore's father's dead.

1:00:25.410 --> 1:00:26.274
Dead?

1:00:27.620 --> 1:00:29.406
He was gunned down
on the road leaving town.

1:00:29.500 --> 1:00:33.573
That's all I know. I just...
I just thought you should be aware.

1:00:42.840 --> 1:00:43.886
[woman] Ready for the picture?

1:00:43.970 --> 1:00:45.380
-Sure, sure.
-[woman] Great.

1:00:46.600 --> 1:00:48.500
Yeah, if we can get the kids
on either side.

1:00:50.350 --> 1:00:54.684
This is all so exciting.
You guys are like heroes.

1:00:54.770 --> 1:00:56.010
[Wendy chuckles softly]

1:00:58.440 --> 1:00:59.646
I love you.

1:01:02.990 --> 1:01:05.151
-Marty.
-I love you.

1:01:07.160 --> 1:01:08.366
[woman] Okay, ready?

1:01:11.080 --> 1:01:11.944
