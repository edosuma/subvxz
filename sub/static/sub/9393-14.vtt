00:36.423 --> 00:38.091
Hey, Chris, what
do you got there?

00:38.125 --> 00:40.326
I made a birdhouse
at school today.

00:40.361 --> 00:41.744
Oh, looks an
awful lot like

00:41.779 --> 00:43.446
the Governor's
Mansion from <i>Benson.</i>

00:43.481 --> 00:45.148
It is.
I'm fond of the series,

00:45.182 --> 00:47.383
and I wanted the local birds
to be aware of that.

00:47.418 --> 00:48.985
Well, I'll be on the lookout
for great tits.

00:49.019 --> 00:50.253
Peter!

00:50.271 --> 00:51.838
Well, actually, Lois,
that's a species of bird

00:51.872 --> 00:54.107
that's known to frequent
domestic birdhouses.

00:54.141 --> 00:55.825
It's why I've always
wanted a birdhouse.

00:55.860 --> 00:56.900
Hey, Lois,
let's go outside

00:56.927 --> 00:58.478
and see if we can
find some great tits.

00:58.512 --> 01:00.146
'Cause there certainly
ain't any in here!

01:00.181 --> 01:02.348
Remember those two
we saw last night?

01:02.383 --> 01:04.050
One was bigger
than the other.

01:04.084 --> 01:05.668
Yeah, and-and the bigger one
had a hair

01:05.703 --> 01:07.103
sticking out
of that pointy thing.

01:07.121 --> 01:08.938
What do you call
that pointy thing, again?

01:08.973 --> 01:09.973
The beak?
Okay.

01:10.007 --> 01:11.140
Come on, Dad!

01:11.175 --> 01:13.409
Maybe we can get the birds
to act out the <i>Benson</i>

01:13.444 --> 01:15.912
where a scheduling snafu
forces the governor to decide

01:15.946 --> 01:19.349
between meeting the president
or going to Katie's school play!

01:19.383 --> 01:20.466
Yay!

01:20.501 --> 01:22.018
Scatterbrained governor.

01:23.053 --> 01:24.237
Welp, there she is.

01:24.271 --> 01:25.405
A birdhouse.

01:25.439 --> 01:26.840
I just hope whoever moves in

01:26.874 --> 01:29.008
doesn't mind the Persian birds
next door.

01:29.043 --> 01:30.577
Eh, tweet, tweet.

01:30.611 --> 01:32.929
Check out my expensive fountain.

01:34.215 --> 01:35.748
Dad, look.

01:38.385 --> 01:40.353
You built
a great birdhouse, son.

01:40.387 --> 01:41.654
I'm real proud of you.

01:41.689 --> 01:42.822
Thanks, Dad.

01:45.242 --> 01:46.442
No!

01:46.477 --> 01:47.493
What just happened?!

01:47.528 --> 01:48.862
What was that thing?!

01:48.896 --> 01:50.864
I don't know. Some
kind of super bird.

01:50.898 --> 01:52.966
Or maybe an average bird
who bought a Bowflex.

01:53.000 --> 01:55.668
Well, that super bird
ruined everything!

01:55.703 --> 01:57.537
Indeed, a force to
be reckoned with,

01:57.571 --> 02:00.039
like Secretary of
Energy Steven Chu.

02:00.074 --> 02:02.175
Secretary Chu,
Ways and Means

02:02.209 --> 02:04.143
has sent over
a preliminary budget.

02:04.178 --> 02:05.595
It looks like
the Department of Energy

02:05.629 --> 02:07.830
is looking at
a four-percent budget cut.

02:09.750 --> 02:11.084
Okay, no budget cut.

02:11.118 --> 02:13.186
No budget cut.

02:16.640 --> 02:18.241
Has anyone seen your father?

02:18.275 --> 02:19.609
It's almost 6:00.

02:19.643 --> 02:20.743
I am here.

02:20.778 --> 02:23.980
Family, I want you to
meet my falcon, Xerxes.

02:24.014 --> 02:25.381
I'm a falconer now.

02:25.416 --> 02:26.583
And yet for Christmas,

02:26.617 --> 02:28.618
I got a wrapped
scrambled egg.

02:29.904 --> 02:31.638
Peter, that falcon
looks pretty dangerous.

02:31.672 --> 02:33.189
Yeah, Peter, get rid
of that thing right now

02:33.223 --> 02:34.190
and eat your dinner.

02:34.224 --> 02:35.191
No!

02:35.225 --> 02:36.192
I am a falconer

02:36.226 --> 02:38.111
and I will eat
whatever Xerxes brings me.

02:38.145 --> 02:39.862
Feed master.

02:44.251 --> 02:45.418
Peter, what the hell?

02:48.555 --> 02:51.557
For Xerxes,
every meal is a pageant.

02:53.160 --> 02:54.143
Hey, Peter.

02:54.178 --> 02:55.378
Oh, falcon. Cool.

02:55.412 --> 02:56.412
Hi, falcon.

02:56.447 --> 02:57.880
Whoa, whoa, easy
there, fella.

02:57.915 --> 02:59.882
Xerxes.
His name is Xerxes.

02:59.917 --> 03:01.317
Uh, what does
Xerxes eat?

03:01.352 --> 03:03.486
Rodents.
Now if you'll excuse me...

03:03.520 --> 03:04.754
What the hell?!

03:04.788 --> 03:06.122
Peter, make him stop!

03:06.156 --> 03:08.992
Hey, what do you got
going on down there, Quagmire?

03:09.026 --> 03:10.627
You got a, you got
a rodent situation?

03:10.661 --> 03:11.694
Uh, no!

03:11.729 --> 03:13.229
Well, Xerxes seems
to think there is.

03:13.263 --> 03:14.230
Get him off, Peter!

03:14.264 --> 03:15.598
Admit you got
a rodent in there.

03:15.633 --> 03:16.616
Peter!
Admit it!

03:18.168 --> 03:19.852
Aw, you scared him
out the front.

03:19.887 --> 03:21.170
Tony, come back!

03:27.478 --> 03:29.912
Oh, what... what...

03:29.947 --> 03:31.714
What do I do?
What do I do?

03:31.749 --> 03:34.150
Well, just hope he's not
standing on your soft spot.

03:34.184 --> 03:35.351
Well, is that possible?

03:35.386 --> 03:36.906
Because that could
really mess up my...

03:40.190 --> 03:41.724
Mom, I need
money for lunch.

03:41.759 --> 03:42.825
Oh, God.

03:42.860 --> 03:43.960
I'm sorry, Chris.

03:43.994 --> 03:46.129
My purse has been
missing for a day now.

03:46.163 --> 03:47.463
I-I can't find
it anywhere.

03:47.498 --> 03:48.498
Not to worry, Lois.

03:48.532 --> 03:49.666
Xerxes will find it.

03:49.700 --> 03:51.934
Xerxes, find Lois's purse.

03:55.489 --> 03:57.506
This is
your purse now.

03:57.524 --> 03:59.776
Peter, I can't carry
my money in this.

04:00.828 --> 04:02.695
Yeah, <i>her</i> money.

04:03.764 --> 04:06.165
You're gonna love the park,
Xerxes.

04:10.187 --> 04:12.605
I think you know
what I want.

04:14.892 --> 04:15.808
This is awesome.

04:15.843 --> 04:17.677
We should have our own TV show.

Are you Peter Griffin?

04:57.217 --> 04:58.151
Yes, sir, I am.

04:58.185 --> 04:59.452
I represent the man

04:59.486 --> 05:01.554
whose sidecar motorcycle
you stole yesterday.

You've piqued my
interest, go on.

05:03.157 --> 05:06.559
Unfortunately for you,
that man is very, very Jewish

05:06.593 --> 05:08.795
and is suing you
for everything you've got.

05:08.829 --> 05:10.279

05:10.314 --> 05:12.031
No! Not Xerxes!

Hello, American Airlines'
magazine?

05:21.959 --> 05:24.060
Have I got a scoop for you.

05:25.095 --> 05:26.913
"Falcon stolen."

05:26.947 --> 05:28.748
Ew, there's a toenail in this.

05:28.782 --> 05:30.633
Guess I'll just go back
to coughing.

05:39.893 --> 05:41.360
Now what are we gonna do?

05:41.395 --> 05:42.628
We have no money.

05:42.663 --> 05:45.231
That's okay, Lois,
we got a wonderful family.

05:45.265 --> 05:46.365
No, we don't.

05:46.400 --> 05:48.151
There's Meg and Dummy
and Big Head.

05:48.185 --> 05:49.318
Damn it, Peter,

05:49.353 --> 05:50.987
I'm probably gonna
have to get a job.

05:51.021 --> 05:53.139
Oh, thank God. Thought I was
gonna have to go back

05:53.173 --> 05:55.074
to being on
<i>Live with Kelly and Peter.</i>

05:55.109 --> 05:58.227
So exhausting having to do
that open-mouth smile

05:58.262 --> 05:59.862
while the guest
does their bit.

05:59.897 --> 06:02.598
We're here with <i>The Good</i>
<i>Wife's</i> Christine Baranski.

06:02.633 --> 06:04.700
So, Christine, you've
actually won an Emmy,

06:04.735 --> 06:05.768
is that right?

06:05.803 --> 06:08.437
Yes, for playing
Maryann on <i>Cybill.</i>

06:08.472 --> 06:09.839
Ah.

06:09.873 --> 06:11.307
But my character
on <i>The Good Wife</i>

06:11.341 --> 06:13.943
is such a complete
departure from Maryann.

06:13.977 --> 06:15.411
Ah!

06:15.445 --> 06:17.847
You've also had
quite a stage career.

06:17.881 --> 06:19.549
I believe you
won a Tony Award?

06:19.583 --> 06:21.450
Well, actually,
I've won two.

06:21.485 --> 06:23.019
Ah!

06:23.053 --> 06:24.420
And one more question,
darling.

06:24.454 --> 06:25.555
Who are you?

06:30.360 --> 06:33.729
Excuse me, would you mind
taking a look at my résumé?

06:33.763 --> 06:35.581
I haven't had
an interview in a while,

06:35.616 --> 06:38.734
and I want to make sure
it's formatted correctly.

06:41.772 --> 06:43.206
Looks okay.
Good.

06:43.240 --> 06:45.591
It's not too braggy?

06:45.626 --> 06:47.627
Hi, I'm sorry,

06:47.661 --> 06:49.328
I couldn't help
but overhear you.

06:49.363 --> 06:51.330
You have an amazing
speaking voice.

06:51.381 --> 06:52.632
My name's Randy.

06:52.666 --> 06:54.901
I can get you steady work
with a voice like that.

06:54.935 --> 06:55.902
Really?

06:55.936 --> 06:57.503
Wow, thank you.

06:57.538 --> 06:58.905
This is great.

06:58.939 --> 07:01.507
Now I won't have to become
a Mary Kay saleswoman.

07:01.542 --> 07:03.276
So, what makes
these shampoos

07:03.310 --> 07:05.111
different from the ones
at the supermarket?

07:05.145 --> 07:08.014
These shampoos
have been in my car.

07:12.419 --> 07:13.419
Guess what everybody?

07:13.453 --> 07:15.588
Oh, my God!
Tampons and groceries?

07:15.622 --> 07:19.492
No-- well, yes--
but also I got discovered today.

07:19.526 --> 07:21.777
I could be one of those
famous voice-over artists

07:21.812 --> 07:24.096
you hear on TV or in the movies.

07:24.131 --> 07:25.531
Ugh, her doing voice-over?

07:25.566 --> 07:26.933
Who wants to hear that?

07:26.967 --> 07:29.118
Maybe she could be one
of those annoying voices

07:29.152 --> 07:31.704
that goes, "Ah, ah, ah,
not that product."

07:31.738 --> 07:33.973
<i>Which of these</i>
<i>leading brands of canned soup</i>

07:34.007 --> 07:36.175
<i>has less than</i>
<i>a hundred grams of sodium?</i>

07:36.210 --> 07:38.177
<i>Ah, ah, ah.Keep going.</i>

07:38.212 --> 07:39.512
<i>Not that one.</i>

07:39.546 --> 07:40.646
<i>Ah, ah, ah.</i>

07:40.681 --> 07:42.048
<i>Not that one either.</i>

07:42.082 --> 07:43.216
<i>Ah, ah, ah.</i>

07:43.250 --> 07:44.483
<i>Nope, not that one.</i>

07:44.518 --> 07:46.152
Look, this isn't even for me.

07:46.186 --> 07:47.720
It's for my homosexual lover.

07:47.754 --> 07:48.988
<i>Ah, ah, ah.</i>

07:49.022 --> 07:50.590
<i>The Bible's pretty clear</i>
<i>about that.</i>

07:53.660 --> 07:55.745
Hi, I'm Lois Griffin.

07:55.779 --> 07:57.730
I have an appointment
to see Randy.

07:57.781 --> 08:00.566
Lois, I'm so glad
you decided to try this.

08:00.601 --> 08:02.435
I can't believe
I'm a celebrity now.

08:02.469 --> 08:03.869
I might hit
someone with my car

08:03.904 --> 08:05.638
on the way home
just for kicks.

08:05.672 --> 08:07.139
Well, I have a feeling

08:07.174 --> 08:09.575
you're gonna be
a big star here.

08:11.745 --> 08:13.179
What am I wearing?

08:13.213 --> 08:15.648
Nothing at all, sweetheart.

08:15.682 --> 08:17.216
Wait a minute.

08:17.251 --> 08:19.352
This is a phone sex operation.

08:19.386 --> 08:20.853
I can't do this.

08:20.887 --> 08:22.622
It pays two grand
a week, sweetie.

08:22.656 --> 08:23.689
Oh, my God.

08:23.724 --> 08:24.991
With that
type of money,

08:25.025 --> 08:27.493
I could buy pots and
pans at Williams-Sonoma.

08:27.527 --> 08:29.595
This is a
very nice set.

08:29.630 --> 08:31.030
You must be a
phone whore.

08:31.064 --> 08:33.099
You bet your
sweet ass I am.

08:42.586 --> 08:44.403
All right, Lois,
you know the drill.

08:44.438 --> 08:45.638
And whatever you do,

08:45.672 --> 08:47.823
do not mention computers
or the Internet.

08:47.858 --> 08:50.126
They cannot
know about it.

08:51.194 --> 08:52.461
Oh, dear.

08:53.830 --> 08:55.331
Hello?

08:55.365 --> 08:57.400
Uh, h-hi there...

08:58.435 --> 08:59.769
...sexy.

08:59.803 --> 09:01.270
I can tell you're
good at this.

09:01.305 --> 09:03.973
Listen, I want to double-team
you on the phone with my son.

09:04.007 --> 09:05.207
Oh.

09:05.242 --> 09:06.976
Yeah, the family's
kind of falling apart.

09:07.010 --> 09:09.295
And I'm just, uh...

09:09.329 --> 09:11.597
just a dad trying to
keep it all together.

09:11.632 --> 09:12.765
I see.

09:12.799 --> 09:14.467
Are you into guys
in wheelchairs?

09:14.501 --> 09:15.534
Not really.

09:15.569 --> 09:16.802
Oh, that's too bad,

09:16.837 --> 09:19.705
'cause, uh, my son's
in a wheelchair.

09:24.444 --> 09:25.511
Hey, Lois.

09:25.545 --> 09:27.046
So, how was your first day
of voice-over?

09:27.080 --> 09:28.447
Eh, it was nothing.

09:28.482 --> 09:29.782
Turns out,
I'm just doing

09:29.816 --> 09:32.218
very obscure
European commercials.

09:32.252 --> 09:33.653
You know,
I have got to get myself

09:33.687 --> 09:35.021
back out there, too.

09:35.055 --> 09:37.440
I haven't performed
since I was in Stewman Group.

09:42.029 --> 09:44.547
I don't get it.
What is this?

09:44.581 --> 09:46.048
We don't know either.

09:50.387 --> 09:52.555
Hi, my name's...

09:52.589 --> 09:53.756
Classy.

09:53.790 --> 09:55.992
What can I do for you,
hot stuff?

09:56.026 --> 09:57.593
Ooh, hi, Classy.

09:57.627 --> 09:59.996
Listen, do you have
a wallet or a purse?

10:00.030 --> 10:01.564
Uh, I have a purse.

10:01.598 --> 10:02.398
Oh.

10:02.432 --> 10:03.432
Oh, baby.

10:03.467 --> 10:05.201
I want you to
take the money out

10:05.235 --> 10:07.436
and count it
really slowly.

10:07.471 --> 10:08.437
Okay.

10:08.472 --> 10:09.438
One.

10:09.473 --> 10:11.140
Ooh, that's nice.

10:11.174 --> 10:12.274
Two.

10:12.309 --> 10:14.276
Oh. Oh, my.

10:14.311 --> 10:16.612
I'm sorry, the next bill
I have in here is a ten.

10:16.646 --> 10:17.613
Oh!

10:17.647 --> 10:18.647
Oh, I love you!

10:18.682 --> 10:20.049
All that and
everything.

10:21.752 --> 10:23.552
Hi, I'm Classy.

10:23.587 --> 10:25.421
All right, let's get
this going, sweet cheeks.

10:25.455 --> 10:26.422
You got a
handkerchief?

10:26.456 --> 10:28.040
Uh, yeah.

10:28.075 --> 10:30.443
Good, ball that up and
stick it in your mouth.

10:30.477 --> 10:31.477
Okay.

10:31.511 --> 10:32.711
Now, what else
you got there?

10:32.729 --> 10:34.030
You got a stapler?

10:34.064 --> 10:35.731
Uh-huh, uh, yeah.

10:35.766 --> 10:36.999
Okay, why don't
you go ahead

10:37.034 --> 10:38.768
and stick that in
your mouth, too.

10:40.537 --> 10:41.804
How about a
mouse pad?

10:41.838 --> 10:42.938
Uh-huh.

10:42.973 --> 10:44.540
Yeah, go ahead
and roll that up

10:44.574 --> 10:46.876
and stuff it
in there.

10:46.910 --> 10:48.360
Did you get a
packet from HR

10:48.395 --> 10:49.829
when you started
working there?

10:51.198 --> 10:52.732
Okay, I'll take
that as a yes.

10:52.766 --> 10:56.068
And I'm pretty certain you know
what I want you to do with it.

10:57.788 --> 11:00.406
Okay, you think you can fit
anything else in your mouth?

11:00.440 --> 11:02.241
Mm-mm.
All right, so now let's start

11:02.275 --> 11:03.909
filling up some
other places.

11:12.736 --> 11:15.337
Peter, I've had
a long day at work,

11:15.372 --> 11:18.340
and right now, sex is the last
thing I want to think about.

11:18.375 --> 11:19.391
What the hell, Lois?

11:19.426 --> 11:21.143
You never want
to do it no more.

11:21.178 --> 11:24.547
What if I told you I'm
holding in a very big dump?

11:24.581 --> 11:27.500
Peter, can't you just
use Sock Lois tonight?

11:27.534 --> 11:31.120
No! Sock Lois doesn't feel
authentic to me anymore.

11:36.126 --> 11:38.561
Hey, Joe, how often
do you have sex with Bonnie?

11:38.595 --> 11:40.663
Well, my HMO only
pays for the equipment

11:40.697 --> 11:42.064
once a year. Why?

11:42.099 --> 11:44.400
Lois barely wants
to do it no more.

11:44.434 --> 11:45.768
I'm going crazy here.

11:45.802 --> 11:47.069
Ugh. I hear you.

11:47.104 --> 11:48.871
Hey, Quagmire, do
yourself a favor:

11:48.905 --> 11:50.339
don't get married.

11:50.373 --> 11:51.474
I wasn't gonna.

11:51.508 --> 11:52.908
Good. Don't.

11:52.943 --> 11:53.943
I wasn't.

11:53.977 --> 11:55.311
Perfect. Don't.

11:55.345 --> 11:58.080
Joe, you telling me not to
has no effect on me whatsoever.

11:58.115 --> 11:59.381
I'm not gonna get married.

11:59.416 --> 12:01.250
Great. Don't.

12:01.284 --> 12:03.469
I mean it, you guys,
this no-sex thing doesn't work.

12:03.503 --> 12:04.804
I need some kind
of outlet.

12:04.838 --> 12:07.173
You know, Peter,
I got just the thing for you.

12:07.207 --> 12:09.041
There's this new phone sex
chick I been calling,

12:09.075 --> 12:10.493
and she is amazing.

12:10.527 --> 12:13.162
Gee, I don't know.
Isn't that cheating on Lois?

12:13.196 --> 12:14.763
No, look, it's
over the phone.

12:14.798 --> 12:16.866
It's like they say:
"Phonin' ain't bonin'."

12:16.900 --> 12:18.934
Yeah. Well, I guess
I could try it.

12:18.969 --> 12:20.069
Trust me, Peter.

12:20.103 --> 12:21.837
Hey, I was right
about telling you

12:21.872 --> 12:23.639
to go see the gynecologist,
wasn't I?

12:25.258 --> 12:27.426
I'd like to see some
vaginas, please.

12:27.460 --> 12:29.862
That's what we're here for.
Come on in.

12:42.742 --> 12:44.643
Hello there, handsome.

12:44.678 --> 12:46.145
I'm Classy.

12:46.179 --> 12:49.782
Um, hi, Classy,
I'm, uh, Peter.

12:49.816 --> 12:50.783
Peter...

12:50.817 --> 12:51.984
Night Shyamalan.

12:52.018 --> 12:54.153
They call me that
'cause I got a big twist

12:54.187 --> 12:55.554
at the end
of my thing.

12:55.589 --> 12:57.006
Oh, my God.

12:58.041 --> 13:00.543
Um... well,
hello, Peter.

13:00.577 --> 13:02.478
What can I do for you?

13:02.512 --> 13:05.014
Um, you want to see some
pictures that I drew?

13:05.048 --> 13:06.899
Um, sure.

13:06.933 --> 13:08.434
This is me
on a elephant.

13:08.468 --> 13:10.302
Wow.
That's beautiful.

13:10.337 --> 13:12.688
Did you draw that
all by yourself?

13:12.722 --> 13:13.689
Uh-huh.

13:13.723 --> 13:15.291
And this is me
on the moon.

13:15.325 --> 13:16.725
I didn't really
go there.

13:16.760 --> 13:18.227
It was just in
my imagination,

13:18.261 --> 13:19.328
so I drawed it.

13:19.362 --> 13:21.664
Wow, you're
really talented.

13:21.698 --> 13:24.333
You know, there's something
about you, Classy.

13:24.367 --> 13:25.768
Something special.

13:25.802 --> 13:27.836
Aw, that's very sweet.

13:27.871 --> 13:29.104
I like your voice.

13:29.139 --> 13:31.273
It makes me want to
hear more of your voice.

13:31.308 --> 13:32.841
Hey, you want to
see a funny comic?

13:32.876 --> 13:34.343
Sure.

13:45.455 --> 13:49.258
He's scared 'cause his friends
got killed in the pie.

13:54.464 --> 13:57.366
So, Peter,
how was your day?

13:57.400 --> 13:58.701
Eh, it was okay.

13:58.735 --> 14:00.336
Except for that
Yokohama beef bowl

14:00.370 --> 14:01.470
I tried for lunch.

14:01.504 --> 14:02.605
Not sitting so well.

14:02.639 --> 14:04.240
Just "okay"?

14:04.274 --> 14:06.976
Didn't try
anything new today?

14:07.010 --> 14:08.677
Talk to anyone
interesting?

14:08.712 --> 14:09.812
No, not really.

14:09.846 --> 14:11.680
Oh, that beef bowl
is wrecking me.

14:11.715 --> 14:13.315
My stomach feels
like that time

14:13.350 --> 14:15.017
I had explosive
diarrhea.

14:18.722 --> 14:20.389
<i>Brown house.</i>

14:24.611 --> 14:25.577
Hello?

14:25.612 --> 14:27.079
Um, hi, Classy.

14:27.113 --> 14:28.280
It's Peter.

14:28.315 --> 14:29.765
Oh, hi there.

14:29.799 --> 14:31.433
I love
when you talk.

14:31.468 --> 14:34.019
Listen, um, I've had
such a good time

14:34.054 --> 14:35.721
talking to you
these past few times

14:35.739 --> 14:38.207
that I was thinking
maybe we could meet.

14:38.241 --> 14:39.441
But you're married!

14:39.476 --> 14:41.026
You've got a wife!

14:41.061 --> 14:43.112
Yeah, but she's been giving
me the cold shoulder lately.

14:43.163 --> 14:44.443
Besides, anything
that comes out,

14:44.464 --> 14:45.848
I can always
take home to her.

14:45.882 --> 14:47.933
I don't think
this is a good idea.

14:47.968 --> 14:51.337
I mean, cheating on your wife
is a very serious thing.

14:51.371 --> 14:53.605
You don't understand,
I have to meet you.

14:53.640 --> 14:55.307
I-I know it
seems sudden,

14:55.342 --> 14:57.743
but I feel a special
connection with you.

14:57.777 --> 14:59.511
Look, you name the
place and the time,

14:59.546 --> 15:00.496
and I'll be there.

15:00.530 --> 15:02.564
You son of a bitch!

15:03.700 --> 15:04.700
Okay.

15:04.734 --> 15:06.285
I'll meet you.

15:06.319 --> 15:07.353
Yay, I did it!

15:07.387 --> 15:08.971
Thanks, Fairy God Peter!

15:09.005 --> 15:12.191
Peter, the power was
within you all along.

15:12.225 --> 15:14.943
Now if you'll excuse me, I'm
meeting Fairy God Quagmire

15:14.978 --> 15:17.363
and Fairy God Joe down
at the Fairy God Clam.

15:17.397 --> 15:19.648
That sounds like a gay bar.
It is a gay bar.

15:26.436 --> 15:28.170
That's right, fellas,
I'm gonna meet her.

15:28.205 --> 15:29.171
Meet who?

15:29.206 --> 15:30.556
Yeah, what are you
talking about?

15:30.590 --> 15:33.259
Oh, I-I thought we were starting
in the middle to save time.

15:33.293 --> 15:34.577
The-the phone sex lady,

15:34.611 --> 15:36.378
I'm gonna meet the phone sex
lady in person.

15:36.413 --> 15:37.646
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
wait a minute, Peter.

15:37.681 --> 15:38.814
I wouldn't do that.

15:38.832 --> 15:41.050
Hang on, Quagmire,
that's a bad idea.

15:41.084 --> 15:42.551
You never want to meet

15:42.586 --> 15:43.953
those phone sex
women in person.

15:43.987 --> 15:45.471
Yeah, I know,
that's what I said.

15:45.505 --> 15:46.472
I wouldn't do it.

15:46.506 --> 15:47.806
Good. Don't.

15:47.841 --> 15:49.561
Joe, Joe, you realize
what you're telling me

15:49.593 --> 15:51.727
not to do,
I'm already not doing!

15:51.761 --> 15:53.395
Okay, I know
you should never meet

15:53.430 --> 15:54.496
a phone sex operator.

15:54.531 --> 15:55.898
All right?
I'm not an idiot.

15:55.932 --> 15:57.600
I would never meet one
of those people, ever.

15:57.634 --> 15:59.251
Good. Don't.

15:59.286 --> 16:01.787
Guys, I have to see
if she's as special in person

16:01.821 --> 16:03.088
as she is on the phone.

16:03.123 --> 16:04.623
Besides, if I listened
to you guys,

16:04.658 --> 16:07.259
I never would've got that job
as a seat filler for fetuses.

16:07.294 --> 16:09.662
Okay, let's take a look
at your baby, shall we?

16:11.915 --> 16:13.215
Hi.

16:13.250 --> 16:15.184
He'll be right back;
he's in the bathroom.

16:18.255 --> 16:20.089
Thanks for
having me, Bonnie.

16:20.123 --> 16:21.724
I just needed
someone to talk to.

16:21.758 --> 16:22.725
Sure, Lois.

16:22.759 --> 16:23.726
What's on your mind?

16:23.760 --> 16:25.394
Well, it's kind
of a long story.

16:25.428 --> 16:26.395
You see...

16:26.429 --> 16:29.131
Eight  hours later...

16:29.165 --> 16:30.532
Oh, my God!

16:30.567 --> 16:32.268
So, as far as
Peter knows,

16:32.302 --> 16:33.869
he's about to
cheat on you?

16:33.903 --> 16:35.938
Lois, you got to
draw the line here.

16:35.972 --> 16:37.406
I know.

16:37.440 --> 16:39.808
There's a lot of crazy things
I'll let Peter get away with.

16:39.843 --> 16:40.943
I even held my tongue

16:40.977 --> 16:43.045
when he went through
that anime phase.

16:43.063 --> 16:45.664
Hey, Lois, me make drive
time to super fun Clam

16:45.699 --> 16:47.866
with noble Quagmire
and wheel-monster Joe.

16:47.901 --> 16:50.102
Go, force!

17:03.767 --> 17:04.733
Peter, what...

17:04.768 --> 17:06.018
Why are you
dressed like that?

17:06.051 --> 17:07.519
What did you do
to your hair?

17:07.554 --> 17:09.622
Business trip, Lois.
Going to Chicago City.

17:09.656 --> 17:11.256
Oh... okay.

17:11.290 --> 17:12.523
I see.

17:12.559 --> 17:13.759
And in case you're
wondering why

17:13.792 --> 17:15.627
I don't have business
charts, yes, I do.

17:17.664 --> 17:19.682
All right, I got to say
good-bye to the kids.

17:20.849 --> 17:21.900
Hey, champ.

17:21.935 --> 17:23.375
I want you to have
this pocket watch.

17:23.386 --> 17:24.803
It still works,
even though it's got

17:24.838 --> 17:26.571
a lot of Civil War
brains all over it.

17:27.840 --> 17:30.943
Meg, I want you to have
this sad-sounding fart.

17:34.648 --> 17:36.215
Chris, people are
gonna tell you

17:36.249 --> 17:38.617
that you're stupid and
that you're no good.

17:39.619 --> 17:40.619
Bye, Otis!

17:51.081 --> 17:52.798
That son of a bitch.

18:00.340 --> 18:01.306
Hello.

18:01.341 --> 18:02.925
You're...

18:02.959 --> 18:04.326
you're beautiful.

18:04.361 --> 18:06.161
So you got to meet me.

18:06.196 --> 18:07.896
Are we gonna do
this or what?

18:07.931 --> 18:10.499
Listen, I... I got to
be honest with you.

18:10.533 --> 18:12.101
I am not, in fact,

18:12.135 --> 18:13.736
the President
of Hot Wheels.

18:13.770 --> 18:15.804
And I also lied about
the giant chef's hat.

18:15.839 --> 18:17.306
I do not have one.

18:17.340 --> 18:18.440
Mm-hmm.

18:18.475 --> 18:20.075
Well, the small
lies don't matter.

18:20.110 --> 18:21.110
Let's go.

18:22.979 --> 18:25.214
Why am I doing this?

18:25.248 --> 18:27.433
You know, I got the greatest
wife in the world.

18:27.467 --> 18:29.351
And we have
one beautiful child.

18:29.386 --> 18:31.854
But did you ever feel like
something was missing?

18:31.888 --> 18:33.689
You know,
something you had once,

18:33.723 --> 18:35.140
but now it's gone?

18:35.175 --> 18:37.793
You mean like the loyalty
of someone you trusted?

18:37.827 --> 18:40.763
Yes, I know exactly
what that feels like.

18:40.797 --> 18:42.664
Yeah, I mean, I was
just goofing around

18:42.682 --> 18:45.167
when I first called you,
but when I heard your voice,

18:45.185 --> 18:48.336
I-I felt like I found
some part of me that was lost.

18:48.354 --> 18:50.639
Doesn't make any sense,
but it...

18:50.673 --> 18:53.592
it felt like some force in
the universe wanted us together.

18:53.626 --> 18:56.595
That's... kind of nice.

18:56.629 --> 18:58.697
I guess I could understand that.

18:58.732 --> 19:00.632
Now that you're here
in front of me,

19:00.667 --> 19:03.435
I think you're the most
beautiful woman I've ever seen.

19:03.470 --> 19:05.788
♪

19:14.280 --> 19:16.949
Eight  hours later...

19:19.769 --> 19:24.006
Ah, I got to say,
I was fantastic.

19:24.040 --> 19:27.276
You think so, you
dirty, rotten cheater?!

19:27.310 --> 19:28.710
Lois!

19:28.745 --> 19:30.612
You-you-you-you
is the phone lady,

19:30.647 --> 19:32.047
you the phone,
you the phone,

19:32.081 --> 19:33.515
you is the phone lady,
you is the phone lady,

19:33.550 --> 19:34.650
you is the phone lady...

19:34.684 --> 19:36.702
You cheated on me!
Lois!

19:36.736 --> 19:38.487
Why the hell were
you doing phone sex?!

19:38.521 --> 19:40.122
I was providing
for our family.

19:40.156 --> 19:41.340
You were lying.

19:41.374 --> 19:43.509
I'm starting to think
that whole Chicago City

19:43.543 --> 19:45.327
business trip was just
a bunch of baloney!

19:45.361 --> 19:46.595
That's not the point!

19:46.629 --> 19:48.096
Well, if you think
about it,

19:48.131 --> 19:50.616
I-I wasn't really cheating
'cause it was with you.

19:50.667 --> 19:52.267
Well, you didn't
know that!

19:52.302 --> 19:53.869
Yeah, but you know what?

19:53.903 --> 19:56.438
In some way, I think I did.

19:56.473 --> 19:58.307
You know, when I heard
your voice on that phone,

19:58.341 --> 19:59.575
I-I felt something.

19:59.609 --> 20:01.243
It was like an instinct,
you know?

20:01.277 --> 20:02.978
Both my heart and my wiener

20:03.012 --> 20:05.280
somehow knew
you were my soul mate.

20:05.315 --> 20:07.549
Well...

20:07.584 --> 20:10.252
I suppose you did
fall for me pretty hard.

20:10.286 --> 20:11.320
Don't you see, Lois?

20:11.354 --> 20:13.655
I fell in love with you
all over again.

20:13.690 --> 20:17.025
And, look, now we just had the
best sex in years because of it.

20:17.060 --> 20:20.195
I know. It's like our privates
were shaking hands

20:20.230 --> 20:22.831
after a successful business
meeting in a swamp.

20:22.866 --> 20:24.833
To me it... it just proves

20:24.868 --> 20:27.169
that we're truly meant
to be together.

20:27.203 --> 20:29.838
Oh, I love you, Peter.

20:29.873 --> 20:31.707
I love you, too, Lois.

20:35.245 --> 20:38.213
By the way, you may have to
become a full-on prostitute,

20:38.248 --> 20:40.716
'cause our phone bill
was $7,000.

20:44.487 --> 20:46.255
Oh, Peter.

20:46.289 --> 20:49.691
I want you to do me so hard
that we have to change churches.

20:49.726 --> 20:50.843
Gross!

20:51.762 --> 20:53.379
I want to wreck you so bad,

20:53.413 --> 20:55.030
you'll look like
an exploded Hot Pocket.

20:55.065 --> 20:56.499
Oh, my God!

20:59.354 --> 21:01.472
Can I interest you guys
in a two-and-a-quarter way?

21:01.506 --> 21:06.506
