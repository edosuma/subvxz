WEBVTT

00:00.091 --> 00:03.447
I defeated Guy Young.
He's a racist.

00:03.567 --> 00:04.904
It's far from ***.

00:06.681 --> 00:09.645
I'll spend every penny I have
to win this divorce, you hear me?

00:09.765 --> 00:12.306
This Christmas show is
gonna be spectacular!

00:12.426 --> 00:16.992
Woo-hoo! Thank you, Santa Claus!

00:17.748 --> 00:19.562
*** is missing.

00:19.682 --> 00:23.009
***

00:23.129 --> 00:26.123
This is stupid!

00:26.514 --> 00:29.991
Look who it is!

00:35.427 --> 00:40.665
[bell dings]

00:40.766 --> 00:44.149
- May I help you, sir?
- Lonely are the insomniacs.

00:44.269 --> 00:45.736
- Mm.
- Mm.

00:45.837 --> 00:47.504
I've been tossing
and turning in my sleep

00:47.605 --> 00:50.006
and this blanket
is very, very itchy.

00:50.108 --> 00:51.674
Could you please take it away?

00:51.775 --> 00:52.975
If that's not too much trouble.

00:53.010 --> 00:55.445
- Of course.
- Thank you.

00:55.546 --> 00:57.614
- Oh!
- Oh.

00:57.715 --> 01:00.183
A stow away.
He's a big boy,

01:00.284 --> 01:02.619
I probably should have
bought him another seat.

01:02.720 --> 01:05.921
- Maybe I should call the pilot.
- Well, I don't think he wants to meet him.

01:06.022 --> 01:08.924
Hm? You know, I've noticed
that you haven't asked me

01:09.025 --> 01:10.792
to put him back in his crib.

01:10.893 --> 01:13.295
- What are you doing?
- I'm writing down my number.

01:13.396 --> 01:15.397
Don't bother.
I am not going to call you.

01:15.499 --> 01:17.466
No, no, no.
This is my bank balance.

01:17.567 --> 01:21.669
And now you've seen
my two biggest assets.

01:21.770 --> 01:24.472
If you don't mind, I'd like
you to go to the bathroom

01:24.573 --> 01:26.241
and get yourself prepared.

01:26.342 --> 01:27.975
If that's fine with you.

01:28.076 --> 01:30.169
Thank you again
for being so helpful.

01:32.000 --> 01:38.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:41.889 --> 01:43.624
You can open your eyes now.

01:43.724 --> 01:45.659
You saw that, right?

01:45.760 --> 01:47.556
That's how you do it.

01:49.664 --> 01:52.131
I'll be four
and a half minutes.

01:58.838 --> 02:02.074
Order in the court.
I object to this divorce.

02:02.176 --> 02:04.477
Lawyers, you've done
a magnificent job

02:04.578 --> 02:06.779
of helping me butt-fuck
my wife in this settlement.

02:06.880 --> 02:08.680
But your services
are no longer needed.

02:08.781 --> 02:10.181
Effective immediately,
you're all fired.

02:10.282 --> 02:12.717
- What did you call us in here for?
- Overruled!

02:12.818 --> 02:15.220
Get the fuck out of here,
goddamn it. Now!

02:15.321 --> 02:18.022
Get those motherfucking
attachÃ©s out of here.

02:18.123 --> 02:21.926
There's a special place
in hell for guys like you.

02:22.027 --> 02:23.960
April, I lost my way.

02:24.062 --> 02:26.597
I spent a lot of sleepless nights
wondering where I went wrong.

02:26.698 --> 02:29.266
But a great change has occurred.

02:29.367 --> 02:32.203
- I love my family now.
- Now is not the time

02:32.304 --> 02:34.071
to have this discussion, Kenny.

02:34.172 --> 02:36.973
- It's too late. - It's only too late
if we sign those documents.

02:37.075 --> 02:40.910
- Don't engage, April.
- You shut your mouth, you white honkey!

02:41.011 --> 02:42.345
<i>C'est, c'est mon.</i>

02:42.446 --> 02:45.014
April, I've grown a lot
as a man since the holidays.

02:45.115 --> 02:48.918
Now all I ask of you is
to think about this decision.

02:49.019 --> 02:51.688
Search your feelings.
If a week from now

02:51.788 --> 02:53.989
your heart tells you
this is the right move...

02:54.091 --> 02:57.058
...then I'll gladly
sign those papers.

02:57.159 --> 02:58.694
We can wait a week.

02:58.794 --> 03:00.295
Right?

03:00.396 --> 03:01.396
[exhales]

03:01.497 --> 03:05.500
You made a wise decision
here today.

03:05.602 --> 03:10.539
Let the thinking and
contemplating begin now.

03:10.640 --> 03:12.773
[chatter]

03:12.874 --> 03:15.876
Everyone
Crew people. Laborers.

03:15.977 --> 03:18.279
Migrant workers.
Please, gather 'round. Everyone.

03:18.380 --> 03:20.648
I know a lot of you guys
are very upset with me

03:20.749 --> 03:23.384
for my behavior
on the Christmas Special.

03:23.485 --> 03:26.320
I want to prove to you guys that I
am willing to turn over a new leaf.

03:26.421 --> 03:28.488
I'm gonna make
a sacrifice right now.

03:28.589 --> 03:32.692
Billy, Trent. Please step-eth
forward to-eth me. Thank you.

03:32.793 --> 03:36.062
Please remove your black Wilson leather
jackets and place them upon the floor.

03:36.163 --> 03:39.599
Do you all behold this?
These are my muscles.

03:39.700 --> 03:42.935
And look at them now.
Just cheap black T-shirts.

03:43.036 --> 03:45.571
You're fired.
Get the fuck outta here.

03:45.672 --> 03:47.906
True change.
We're all capable of it.

03:48.007 --> 03:49.647
Let's fucking
get this show back on track!

03:49.743 --> 03:51.577
- Let's...
- Mr. Powers.

03:51.678 --> 03:53.746
Mr. Powers.
Sorry to interrupt, but,

03:53.846 --> 03:57.115
before you apologize, perhaps you'd
like to hear what we have to say.

03:57.216 --> 03:58.850
Uh, I'm trying to bond
with my crew right now.

03:58.951 --> 04:00.351
So...
maybe this can wait, suit.

04:00.452 --> 04:02.887
My name is Ronny Thelman.

04:02.988 --> 04:06.023
And this here
is my friend's son, Jerome.

04:06.124 --> 04:09.093
I'm sorry, why do I care about
your family tree-slash-life story?

04:09.194 --> 04:12.163
Well, you see, I'm head of the
network and therefore your boss.

04:12.264 --> 04:16.065
Oh! My bad. Very fascinating story.
Please continue, I'm sorry.

04:16.166 --> 04:17.767
- Come here, Mr. Powers.
- OK. Yeah.

04:17.868 --> 04:19.503
[Ronny] Come on.

04:19.603 --> 04:22.739
Kenny, I think you're great.

04:22.840 --> 04:25.008
I saw your Christmas Special
and I thought it was

04:25.109 --> 04:27.010
the most fantastic bit
of television I've ever seen.

04:27.111 --> 04:29.346
The fact that it was Christmas
and yet you was behaving

04:29.447 --> 04:31.181
in the most
selfish manner was...

04:31.282 --> 04:33.549
it was a breath of fresh air.

04:33.650 --> 04:35.083
I wanna renew your contract.

04:35.185 --> 04:36.852
I wanna offer you a new show.

04:36.953 --> 04:39.488
- Your own show.
- Are you serious?

04:39.589 --> 04:42.391
Yeah. I want you to be
the next Ellen DeGeneres.

04:42.492 --> 04:44.927
Well... she's pretty dope.
But she's a lesbian.

04:45.028 --> 04:46.595
I know she's a lesbian.
I was in the meeting

04:46.697 --> 04:47.696
when we decided
she should be one.

04:47.797 --> 04:49.597
And I was in the meeting
when we decided

04:49.699 --> 04:51.179
that Ryan Seacrest
should be straight.

04:51.233 --> 04:53.401
- That was a good call.
- You know what?

04:53.502 --> 04:55.603
I think for your first show
I've got the idea.

04:55.705 --> 04:58.707
It's gonna be a world exclusive
interview of Guy Young.

04:58.808 --> 05:00.842
First time since
his fall from grace.

05:00.943 --> 05:03.277
Get him on the couch.
Get him to apologize.

05:03.378 --> 05:06.079
You know, maybe shed some tears.
You know, really open up.

05:06.180 --> 05:08.482
Well, I mean, that sounds like
a great idea in theory

05:08.583 --> 05:10.617
but Guy Young and myself
are not really friends.

05:10.719 --> 05:12.419
I mean, he's a mess.
I destroyed the man's life.

05:12.520 --> 05:14.321
I know you did.
I mean, the thing is,

05:14.422 --> 05:16.189
you know, you either want
the show or you don't.

05:16.290 --> 05:18.225
No, no, no.
You want Guy Young?

05:18.326 --> 05:20.626
- I'll get you Guy Young.
- Fantastic.

05:20.728 --> 05:22.495
Jerome, you look tired.

05:22.596 --> 05:24.096
Do you want a break?

05:24.197 --> 05:27.933
Uh, any of you girls
any good with children?

05:28.034 --> 05:29.769
Great. This is Jerome.
He's 13 years old.

05:29.870 --> 05:33.339
Do you mind taking him into the other
room and thucking his willy off?

05:33.440 --> 05:35.140
- [Stevie] Kenny.
- [Maria] Kenny.

05:35.242 --> 05:37.175
- [Kenny] There he is.
- Kenny's here.

05:37.276 --> 05:38.643
Looking good, champ.

05:38.745 --> 05:41.012
You think I look good.
Oh.

05:41.113 --> 05:44.983
Look at all the little worker
bees tending to their queen.

05:45.084 --> 05:47.386
That's good little <i>muchachos,</i>
<i>helping your father.</i>

05:47.487 --> 05:52.189
I tell you, trying to kill myself
was the best thing I ever did.

05:52.290 --> 05:54.024
- It's pretty awesome.
- OK. Good.

05:54.125 --> 05:57.094
What a nice family.
Thank you guys.

05:57.195 --> 05:59.830
Look at us, man.
Two dudes on the mend, huh?

05:59.931 --> 06:02.933
With this new television show we're gonna
be more famous than Oprah Winfrey.

06:03.034 --> 06:06.303
Speaking of, [sing song]
I read your screenplay.

06:06.405 --> 06:08.671
Finally, motherfucker.
Jesus Christ.

06:08.773 --> 06:09.972
I've been sitting here
on goddamn pins and needles.

06:10.073 --> 06:11.340
What'd you think?
You love it?

06:11.442 --> 06:14.544
Uhh... It was good.
It was...

06:14.645 --> 06:16.579
- I like the...
- [Kenny] Hmm?

06:16.680 --> 06:19.449
- The stage directions.
- The stage directions?

06:19.550 --> 06:23.419
Uh, it's always very clear
who was talking to each other.

06:23.520 --> 06:25.387
Dude, what about the story,
dude? Did it connect for you?

06:25.488 --> 06:27.355
Kenny, it's all voice over.

06:27.457 --> 06:29.357
Show, don't tell.
That's the golden rule.

06:29.459 --> 06:32.180
Jesus Christ. Dude, I think that
gunshot wound gave you down syndrome.

06:32.228 --> 06:33.962
- [laughs] - You need to work on
your communication skills

06:34.063 --> 06:35.731
- with auteurs, OK?
- But the ending,

06:35.832 --> 06:37.999
- it coulda been so much stronger...
- Goddamn.

06:38.100 --> 06:40.468
You injure your fucking jaw
and suddenly you're Roger Ebert.

06:40.569 --> 06:43.237
I'm more Gene Siskel.
Ra-ra-ra.

06:43.338 --> 06:45.139
- [laughs]
- I'll let this pass, brother,

06:45.240 --> 06:47.074
because you are a little loopy
from the pain medicine.

06:47.175 --> 06:48.876
Hey, you want some Vicodin?

06:48.977 --> 06:51.746
- Yeah, sure. I'll take one.
- Kenny Jr.,

06:51.847 --> 06:53.414
bring Daddy them pills.

06:53.515 --> 07:00.019
[soft rock playing]

07:00.120 --> 07:04.758
[music stops]

07:04.859 --> 07:06.860
- [knocks on door]
- Guy?

07:06.961 --> 07:09.496
[Guy, faint] Thank you so much.

07:09.597 --> 07:14.433
- Guy? Guy?
- I love you. Guy Young loves you.

07:14.534 --> 07:15.768
[Guy] Thank you.

07:15.869 --> 07:18.471
- Thank you. [laughs]
- <i>[audience cheering]</i>

07:18.572 --> 07:20.773
Welcome back to
another session of <i>The Sesh.</i>

07:20.874 --> 07:24.510
I'm Guy Young and man, we got
a great show. Thank you.

07:24.611 --> 07:28.913
- Thank you. [laughs]
- Geyser.

07:29.014 --> 07:30.014
What's up, Old Faithful?

07:30.182 --> 07:32.650
- What's going on here?
- Well--

07:32.751 --> 07:35.419
If it isn't the great TV star,
Kenny Powers.

07:35.521 --> 07:37.689
I come in peace, Guy.
I bring good news.

07:37.790 --> 07:39.991
Oh yeah? Well,
unless that good news

07:40.092 --> 07:43.594
is you have testicular cancer,
I don't give a rat's ass.

07:43.695 --> 07:46.296
I don't have cancer
in my balls, Guy.

07:46.397 --> 07:48.866
But I do have a brand new
television show.

07:48.967 --> 07:51.969
Oh, goddamn it. What are you
trying to do to me, Kenny, huh?

07:52.069 --> 07:53.436
You just trying to twist
the knife in my back?

07:53.538 --> 07:56.507
I never wanted you
to end up this way, Guy.

07:56.608 --> 07:59.309
This competition
got the best of both of us.

07:59.410 --> 08:01.677
And I want to take
responsibility for my actions.

08:01.778 --> 08:03.379
No.

08:03.480 --> 08:05.247
It's not that easy.

08:05.348 --> 08:07.149
I've lost everything.
I lost my show.

08:07.250 --> 08:10.987
I lost my food chains.
I lost... my AIDS charity.

08:11.087 --> 08:14.089
- Nobody wants me anymore.
- <i>[audience noise continues]</i>

08:14.190 --> 08:16.525
I don't think I can help you
get AIDS back, Guy.

08:16.626 --> 08:19.227
But I can offer you
a chance at redemption.

08:19.328 --> 08:22.831
I'd like to grant to you an
interview as the very first guest

08:22.932 --> 08:25.834
on the first episode
of my brand new show.

08:25.935 --> 08:28.169
You can apologize
to the masses.

08:28.270 --> 08:30.539
You can begin
the difficult task

08:30.640 --> 08:32.640
of rebuilding your brand.

08:32.741 --> 08:34.174
No.

08:34.275 --> 08:38.846
I shit on your kind gesture.

08:38.947 --> 08:41.048
- [volume increases]
- Guy, you can't quit.

08:41.149 --> 08:43.751
You don't belong in here, man.
You belong out there.

08:43.852 --> 08:47.187
You're a natural born celebrity.

08:47.288 --> 08:48.721
[volume muted]

08:48.822 --> 08:50.322
Why are you doing this, Kenny?

08:50.424 --> 08:52.759
Because once upon a time,

08:52.860 --> 08:55.327
a dear friend did the
same exact thing for me.

08:55.429 --> 08:58.330
Gave me a shot when the rest of
the world had counted me out.

08:58.432 --> 09:01.701
Seems only fair
to return the favor.

09:01.802 --> 09:03.769
OK, that was very cool,
what you just said.

09:03.870 --> 09:06.638
I mean, I wasn't as down
as you are now

09:06.739 --> 09:09.007
- when you found me.
- [scoffs] You were pretty...

09:09.108 --> 09:11.877
- You were pretty fucking down.
- Well, I wasn't bleeding from my shins

09:11.978 --> 09:15.981
nor did I have my own urine
in Gatorade bottles.

09:16.082 --> 09:18.850
So I think you're doing
worse than I was doing.

09:18.952 --> 09:21.351
Oh no. Johnny Appleseed
is dying.

09:21.453 --> 09:27.124
He was loved by all,
even the animals.

09:27.225 --> 09:30.126
Johnny Appleseed's dream
was to plant enough seeds

09:30.227 --> 09:33.129
so no one would ever
have to be hungry again.

09:33.230 --> 09:35.298
Kids got chops.
It's not too bad.

09:35.399 --> 09:40.003
He'll always be remembered
for what great things he did.

09:40.104 --> 09:43.206
[applause]

09:43.307 --> 09:46.341
[Kenny] Yeah.
Yeah, boy.

09:46.442 --> 09:48.510
My son is main star
of the play.

09:48.612 --> 09:51.146
His part is more important
than all the other children.

09:51.247 --> 09:53.682
Woo! Good work!

09:53.783 --> 09:56.819
- Look at our little guy there, huh?
- [April] I know.

09:56.920 --> 09:59.154
- The tiniest pothead.
- [laughing]

09:59.255 --> 10:01.175
I gotta say, this feels
pretty goddamn good, huh?

10:01.257 --> 10:03.124
- Mm-hmm.
- What do you say?

10:03.225 --> 10:06.027
Should we take the kids out for a
little celebratory pizza party?

10:06.128 --> 10:08.262
Our family finally
reunited again.

10:08.363 --> 10:12.333
It sounds so nice,
but, um, I can't.

10:12.434 --> 10:14.135
Are you on a diet or something?

10:14.236 --> 10:15.369
We can go get milkshakes
if you want to.

10:15.470 --> 10:18.105
No, I can't.

10:18.205 --> 10:20.440
I've been thinking
about this a lot.

10:20.541 --> 10:22.843
And, um,
I gotta be honest with you.

10:22.944 --> 10:24.778
I'm scared you're gonna
break my heart again.

10:24.879 --> 10:28.015
I love you so much.

10:28.116 --> 10:31.618
But we can't be together.

10:31.719 --> 10:35.521
- [sighs]
- I'm moving to Santa Fe.

10:35.622 --> 10:38.658
Santa Fe? What the fuck.
I mean, that's pretty far away.

10:38.759 --> 10:41.861
I know but I got a new job.

10:41.962 --> 10:45.631
I'm gonna be
the new branch manager.

10:45.732 --> 10:48.367
- Are you OK?
- [exhaling]

10:48.468 --> 10:49.834
- You're breathing really heavy...
- Yeah, no. I know.

10:49.935 --> 10:54.205
I'm just... practicing
relaxation exercises.

10:54.306 --> 10:59.144
You know you can
come visit anytime.

10:59.244 --> 11:05.050
You are so welcome to.

11:05.151 --> 11:07.432
<i>[Kenny] In the end, Kenny Powers
didn't get what he wanted,</i>

11:07.485 --> 11:31.774
<i>but he got what he needed.</i>

11:31.875 --> 11:33.176
Here we are.

11:33.276 --> 11:35.277
The pinnacle of success.

11:35.378 --> 11:38.646
Our journey ends here, Stevie.
At the top.

11:38.748 --> 11:40.281
I couldn't have done it
without you.

11:40.382 --> 11:42.851
I'm feeling good as hell
about this, dog.

11:42.952 --> 11:45.587
I feel like Lil Wayne
with this sizzurp.

11:45.688 --> 11:48.890
It's crazy. I always thought
this moment would be joyous.

11:48.991 --> 11:51.693
But instead of wonder,
I only feel isolation.

11:51.794 --> 11:53.728
That's the pre-show
jitters, dog.

11:53.829 --> 11:56.530
Them the butterflies.
You got this, Kenny.

11:56.631 --> 11:59.800
[deep breath, exhales]

11:59.901 --> 12:01.535
[grunts softly]

12:01.636 --> 12:03.971
[Ronny] That's the sickest
bastard in television.

12:04.072 --> 12:05.439
What's up with this kung fu?

12:05.540 --> 12:06.941
Just preparation, dog.

12:07.042 --> 12:09.482
Listen, I wanna go over what
you're gonna say today, all right?

12:09.510 --> 12:11.310
I thought that I could just
say whatever I wanted to.

12:11.411 --> 12:12.645
- Just riff. Speak from the heart.
- Yeah.

12:12.747 --> 12:14.047
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Well,
I'm just gonna tell you

12:14.148 --> 12:15.982
- what your heart is telling you to say.
- OK.

12:16.083 --> 12:18.317
When you get out
and you see Guy Young,

12:18.418 --> 12:20.553
I want you to crush him,
all right?

12:20.654 --> 12:23.356
I want you to break him
like he's a teenage hymen.

12:23.457 --> 12:24.924
That's not what we talked about, I
didn't think it was that kind of a show.

12:25.025 --> 12:26.558
I thought this was like a feel good
thing, like therapeutic, dude.

12:26.659 --> 12:28.093
- Like Ellen.
- No, no, no. It's nothing like Ellen.

12:28.194 --> 12:30.528
Ellen's a lesbian. The idea
of the show is humiliation.

12:30.630 --> 12:33.632
This is like reality TV.
Who'd be a star, right?

12:33.733 --> 12:35.667
- Sure.
- Indulge me,

12:35.769 --> 12:37.269
- for one moment. Please, Kenny.
- Yeah, sure.

12:37.370 --> 12:38.703
Thank you, Kenny.
All right.

12:38.805 --> 12:41.039
Jerome, come over here.

12:41.141 --> 12:43.707
Jerome, you see that man
in the blue shirt there?

12:43.809 --> 12:45.309
- [Jerome] Yeah.
- Yeah? The fat one.

12:45.410 --> 12:47.211
I want you to go up there,
get your fingers

12:47.312 --> 12:49.247
and I want you to ram 'em
up his asshole.

12:49.347 --> 12:51.249
You wanna learn about
television, yeah?

12:51.349 --> 12:54.518
Go and do that.
Go on.

12:54.619 --> 13:00.657
Look at this, Kenny.

13:00.758 --> 13:03.393
- Hey!
- Hey, hey. Don't shove him.

13:03.494 --> 13:07.998
- Bully.
- [laughter]

13:08.099 --> 13:11.634
That's how you do it.

13:11.735 --> 13:14.403
Well? You see?
They love me.

13:14.504 --> 13:16.172
Because I humiliated
the fat man.

13:16.273 --> 13:18.174
It's gonna be the same
with the audience today.

13:18.275 --> 13:21.510
That fat man tonight
is Guy Young.

13:21.611 --> 13:26.282
I want you to look
in that mirror now.

13:26.382 --> 13:27.749
Would you say,
"I'm a bad man."?

13:27.851 --> 13:31.820
- Just... just to say it into the mirror?
- Yeah.

13:31.921 --> 13:33.988
I'm a bad man.

13:34.089 --> 13:36.257
Say, "I'm a very bad man."

13:36.358 --> 13:37.792
"I'm a very bad man."

13:37.893 --> 13:39.727
[laughs] You're a bad man.

13:39.829 --> 13:41.229
[Ronny, whispering]
You are, Kenny.

13:41.330 --> 13:44.833
You see, once the audience
see who you are,

13:44.934 --> 13:46.566
they will love you.

13:46.667 --> 13:49.169
You go out and
you kill Guy Young.

13:49.270 --> 13:51.438
You kill him.
All right?

13:51.539 --> 13:52.973
Got it.

13:53.074 --> 13:57.010
Let's go. Come on.
You had fun. You're having fun.

13:57.111 --> 13:58.378
Stevie, what do you
think about that?

13:58.479 --> 14:00.914
[groans]

14:01.015 --> 14:04.884
Champion. Thank you
so much for doing this.

14:04.985 --> 14:07.720
You're a good friend.
And an even better man.

14:07.821 --> 14:09.455
No problem, Guy.

14:09.556 --> 14:10.923
I love you.

14:11.024 --> 14:12.959
[mumbles] I love you too.

14:13.060 --> 14:15.962
I'll see you out there, buddy.

14:16.063 --> 14:17.496
[sighs]

14:17.597 --> 14:21.333
[Dixie] So, April, Santa Fe,
how exciting is that?

14:21.433 --> 14:23.668
Just put your
broken marriage behind you.

14:23.769 --> 14:26.838
- You know. Just do one of these.
- In time.

14:26.939 --> 14:29.774
- You know, you should try online dating.
- [TV chatter]

14:29.876 --> 14:32.143
- Dixie, I'm not ready to date.
- Are you sure?

14:32.245 --> 14:35.112
- Positive.
- Not getting any younger.

14:35.213 --> 14:36.881
You're just getting older.

14:36.982 --> 14:39.283
- Gene, please turn off the TV.
- [sighs]

14:39.384 --> 14:41.818
OK? You can go one day
without watching television.

14:41.920 --> 14:43.888
No TV, how am I
supposed to drown you out?

14:43.989 --> 14:45.956
- I'm sorry. What's that, honey?
- Huh?

14:46.057 --> 14:48.792
<i>- [audience cheering]</i>
<i>- [man] And now it's time</i>

14:48.894 --> 14:50.159
<i>for the</i> Powers Hour.

14:50.261 --> 15:01.670
[cheering and applause]

15:01.772 --> 15:03.572
Hello and how are you, America?

15:03.673 --> 15:05.474
Welcome to <i>Powers Hour.</i>

15:05.575 --> 15:08.143
I'm your host, Kenneth Powers,
and I'm here today

15:08.244 --> 15:09.311
to give you straight talk.

15:09.412 --> 15:11.346
- <i>[cheering]</i>
<i>- Oh, oh. It's starting.</i>

15:11.447 --> 15:14.049
Powers Hour <i>will be unlike</i>
<i>any other show on daytime talk.</i>

15:14.150 --> 15:16.684
<i>Because we're gonna give it to you real
and we're gonna give it to you hard.</i>

15:16.786 --> 15:19.454
Guys, we have coasters
for a reason.

15:19.555 --> 15:21.315
<i>That's right, you'll be</i>
<i>getting it real hard.</i>

15:21.391 --> 15:22.323
- Turn it off, Gene.
- <i>[Kenny] Charlotte.</i>

15:22.424 --> 15:24.125
Come on, Dixie.
We're watching this.

15:24.226 --> 15:27.395
No. We're not watching this.
'Cause I said to turn it off.

15:27.495 --> 15:29.363
OK? We wanna socialize.

15:29.464 --> 15:31.498
Gene, one,

15:31.599 --> 15:35.069
- two, two and a half...
- Oh. You know what?

15:35.170 --> 15:37.338
You want the remote?
You want it?

15:37.439 --> 15:38.638
I'm gonna stick it up my ass,
all right?

15:38.739 --> 15:41.174
And then you can come up there
and dig it out yourself.

15:41.275 --> 15:43.209
Well, guess what, genius, look.

15:43.311 --> 15:45.045
Now you're not watching Kenny,
OK?

15:45.146 --> 15:47.880
Oh yeah, well I'll just turn it on
by squeezing my fucking ass cheeks.

15:47.982 --> 15:52.052
Now piss off, Dixie!
Goddamn it!

15:52.153 --> 15:55.254
- We'll talk later.
- [Gene, mocking] Oh, "we'll talk later."

15:55.355 --> 15:58.523
You will anyway and I'll just zone
out and act like I give a shit.

15:58.624 --> 16:00.926
Now sit on it. Idiot.

16:01.027 --> 16:03.528
<i>[cheering and applause]</i>

16:03.629 --> 16:07.166
<i>Now today's show</i>
<i>is all about second chances.</i>

16:07.267 --> 16:11.302
Later on in the episode we have the
results of some exciting paternity tests

16:11.403 --> 16:14.138
which are gonna give some young men
a second chance at responsibility.

16:14.239 --> 16:15.606
This is gonna be a big hit.

16:15.707 --> 16:19.010
Now folks, I'd like to
introduce a very special guest.

16:19.111 --> 16:22.546
Now this man at one point
was loved and admired by all.

16:22.647 --> 16:25.516
- But now he's universally hated.
- [Stevie laughs]

16:25.617 --> 16:28.452
Ladies and gentleman,
please put your hands together

16:28.552 --> 16:32.755
- for Guy Young.
- [booing]

16:32.857 --> 16:33.790
Eat a dick.

16:33.891 --> 16:42.164
[booing continues]

16:42.265 --> 16:45.234
How does it feel to hear
people booing you like that?

16:45.335 --> 16:48.437
- It's hard.
- These people look at you

16:48.538 --> 16:49.938
and they think
very negative of you.

16:49.973 --> 16:51.874
- Yeah.
- They don't like you.

16:51.975 --> 16:54.276
- Yeah, I get that.
- Because of the things you said.

16:54.378 --> 16:56.045
- Yes.
- That's why you're here today,

16:56.146 --> 16:57.746
you want to apologize
for what you said.

16:57.847 --> 16:59.780
Thank goodness your show exists,
because, um...

16:59.882 --> 17:01.116
[Kenny] Well, Guy, guess what?

17:01.217 --> 17:03.418
That's not gonna happen.

17:03.519 --> 17:05.953
You just walked into an ambush,
old friend.

17:06.055 --> 17:08.356
- Boom!
- [cheering]

17:08.457 --> 17:10.936
Because people here don't give
a shit about second chances, no.

17:10.992 --> 17:14.594
What they'd rather see, you
humiliated on national television.

17:14.694 --> 17:30.476
[cheering]

17:30.577 --> 17:35.581
But that's not what I want.

17:35.682 --> 17:38.084
- And I say fuck what these people want.
- What?

17:38.185 --> 17:41.487
[Kenny] I made a lot of mistakes
on my return to superstardom.

17:41.588 --> 17:43.756
- Kenny...
- I screwed a lot of pooches.

17:43.857 --> 17:45.824
I fucked a lot of folks.

17:45.926 --> 17:49.027
<i>I labored for</i>
<i>far too long for lesser men.</i>

17:49.128 --> 17:50.195
[scoffs]

17:50.296 --> 17:52.130
<i>I used my god given abilities</i>

17:52.231 --> 17:56.168
<i>to destroy men's lives.</i>

17:56.269 --> 17:57.735
<i>I betrayed good people.</i>

17:57.836 --> 18:01.206
<i>I ruthlessly stepped upon</i>
<i>the week and the strong.</i>

18:01.307 --> 18:04.375
<i>I turned them into my slaves.</i>

18:04.476 --> 18:07.844
- Come on...
- Even the fiercest of warriors

18:07.946 --> 18:09.613
<i>is nothing to me.</i>

18:09.714 --> 18:11.348
<i>Powerless.</i>

18:11.450 --> 18:13.784
I was absolutely terrible
to everybody in my fucking life,

18:13.885 --> 18:15.352
<i>including everyone</i>
<i>I worked with.</i>

18:15.454 --> 18:17.955
Everyone I lived with,
my friends, my family.

18:18.056 --> 18:20.523
<i>I was horrendous.</i>

18:20.624 --> 18:22.992
<i>And why did I do these
[bleep] things you ask?</i>

18:23.094 --> 18:25.795
<i>Well, it's simple, really.</i>

18:25.896 --> 18:28.531
<i>I thought that fame,</i>
<i>fortune and success</i>

18:28.632 --> 18:30.467
<i>was the only way</i>
<i>I would ever be happy.</i>

18:30.568 --> 18:34.703
<i>And I've paid a steep price</i>
<i>for this train of thinking.</i>

18:34.804 --> 18:38.073
I've lost the only woman
I ever loved.

18:38.174 --> 18:42.578
And the only woman
who ever loved me.

18:42.678 --> 18:44.746
So from this moment forward,

18:44.847 --> 18:47.816
the vicious dragon
that was Kenny Powers

18:47.917 --> 18:50.184
will retreat back to his cave.

18:50.285 --> 18:52.920
Back to hibernation.

18:53.021 --> 18:58.659
Until the next foolish knight
awakens his wrath.

18:58.760 --> 19:02.497
- [Guy] When... When do I get to make my apology?
- Hmm?

19:02.598 --> 19:07.967
Do... do I get to
make my apology now?

19:08.068 --> 19:11.471
Yep. It's all yours, buddy.

19:11.572 --> 19:13.873
[mic feedback]

19:13.974 --> 19:20.046
Fucking duck's clit!

19:20.148 --> 19:23.749
[Guy] First off, let me say,
I love black people.

19:23.850 --> 19:26.018
Grab all the personal effects,
Stevie.

19:26.119 --> 19:27.886
All the personal accoutrements,
please.

19:27.987 --> 19:31.722
- Shane, go there.
- Kenny Powers, I'm fucking annoyed with you,

19:31.823 --> 19:33.057
you pair of hedgehog tits!

19:33.159 --> 19:36.594
You upset a little kid who's
very, very sick with herpes.

19:36.695 --> 19:39.930
He was expecting to see
some American badass,

19:40.032 --> 19:43.234
not some nancy boy...
[grunts]

19:43.335 --> 19:45.836
- How's that for a badass?
- Oooh!

19:45.937 --> 19:49.739
World Star! World Star!

19:49.840 --> 20:00.750
Fuck you!

20:00.851 --> 20:07.089
- [engine shuts off]
- [sets emergency brake]

20:07.191 --> 20:09.124
- Hey, little dudes.
- Hey, Daddy.

20:09.226 --> 20:11.527
- Hey, Daddy.
- Look who's mastered the beast, huh?

20:11.628 --> 20:14.963
[chuckles] Looks like you guys
are gonna be moving out west.

20:15.065 --> 20:18.366
Those kids from the rez,
they're not gonna like you.

20:18.467 --> 20:20.835
Many moons ago the white man
stole their land,

20:20.936 --> 20:22.737
so they're instantly
gonna have a hatred for you.

20:22.838 --> 20:26.374
As long as you keep Dakota by your side
and never show 'em an ounce of fear,

20:26.475 --> 20:28.310
one day, you can
gain their respect.

20:28.411 --> 20:30.078
[both] OK, Daddy.

20:30.179 --> 20:33.648
I hope to get out to see
you there sometime, you guys.

20:33.749 --> 20:36.317
You know, Southwest airlines
has a hub in Albuquerque.

20:36.418 --> 20:39.186
There's no first class
on that airline, obviously,

20:39.287 --> 20:42.489
but they do have that
business select option.

20:42.591 --> 20:46.327
You get the... coupons
for the premium drinks

20:46.428 --> 20:49.630
and the priority access,
be the first on the plane.

20:49.731 --> 20:56.402
Even offer the double rapid reward
points for your miles there.

20:56.503 --> 20:59.105
Hopefully I'll stack up
a bunch of those...

20:59.206 --> 21:04.477
...from all the times
I'll come out there and visit.

21:04.578 --> 21:06.145
I'm gonna miss you guys.

21:06.246 --> 21:09.013
I'm gonna miss you too.

21:09.115 --> 21:11.015
Bring it in here.

21:11.117 --> 21:13.218
[sighs] Love you guys.

21:13.319 --> 21:35.839
[both] Love you too.

21:35.940 --> 21:38.841
- Oh. Hey.
- Hey.

21:38.942 --> 21:42.178
Surprised to see you're
taking so much of that

21:42.280 --> 21:44.013
traditional modern shit we had.

21:44.114 --> 21:47.717
Seems like it might kinda clash with the
Spanish style they rock there in Santa Fe.

21:47.818 --> 21:51.421
- Mmm. - Might wanna think about
getting some Navajo rugs

21:51.522 --> 21:53.456
or some ristras...

21:53.557 --> 21:57.259
Kokopellis, the little
skinny dudes with the trumpets.

21:57.360 --> 22:00.496
I guess we'll see
once we get there.

22:00.597 --> 22:02.130
Yeah.

22:02.231 --> 22:05.334
This is it.
The paper's are signed.

22:05.435 --> 22:08.937
You and I are
officially divorced.

22:09.038 --> 22:13.174
[April] Thank you.

22:13.275 --> 22:14.609
What are you gonna do now?

22:14.710 --> 22:18.846
I don't know. Stevie and I have
been cooking up a few things.

22:18.947 --> 22:20.788
Now that I'm done with
the television industry,

22:20.882 --> 22:24.118
it might be high time to finally
step into the feature film world.

22:24.219 --> 22:27.120
- [April] Mm.
- At least with movies it's not all about the money.

22:27.221 --> 22:32.025
Well, I know you will succeed
at anything you try.

22:32.126 --> 22:34.795
Hmm. Yeah, well... [chuckles]

22:34.895 --> 22:37.964
We'll see.

22:38.065 --> 22:41.301
Goodbye, April.

22:41.402 --> 22:45.404
- Goodbye, Kenny.
- [sighs]

22:45.505 --> 22:47.973
You know, April,

22:48.074 --> 22:51.276
when I told you that I wasn't
happy with you and the kids,

22:51.378 --> 22:54.380
that wasn't true.

22:54.481 --> 22:57.450
I was never unhappy
with you guys.

22:57.551 --> 22:59.784
I was unhappy with myself.

22:59.885 --> 23:02.454
I just wanted to be a success.

23:02.555 --> 23:06.324
It turns out I was a success
the whole entire time.

23:06.425 --> 23:11.463
As a father, a husband.

23:11.564 --> 23:13.638
A pretty goddamn
good one at that.

23:16.668 --> 23:19.970
I just thought you should know.

23:20.071 --> 23:22.239
- [April] Kenny, stop.
- No, April, it's fine...

23:22.340 --> 23:25.041
Oh. Just stop.

23:35.486 --> 23:40.623
<i>[Kenny] If you ask me, the secret to
success is to have a diverse portfolio.</i>

23:40.724 --> 23:45.127
<i>Too much of any one thing</i>
<i>is fucking</i> no bueno.

23:45.228 --> 23:47.729
<i>-</i> [inaudible]
<i>- Of course, sometimes, balancing can be hard.</i>

23:47.830 --> 23:50.365
<i>But all things worth having</i>
<i>are worth fighting for.</i>

23:50.466 --> 23:52.434
Kids, I can throw the ball
faster than fuck

23:52.535 --> 23:55.103
and now I'm the most popular
teacher in this school.

23:55.204 --> 23:56.738
Cutler, you're fucking out.

23:56.839 --> 23:58.673
Big cans,
bring me them titties.

23:58.775 --> 24:02.143
My life is ruined.

24:02.244 --> 24:05.078
<i>[Kenny]</i>
<i>Sometimes hard work pays off.</i>

24:05.179 --> 24:06.747
Yay, Kenny.

24:06.848 --> 24:07.882
[Kenny] And, cut!

24:07.982 --> 24:09.950
- Pretty powerful.
- Perfect.

24:10.051 --> 24:12.152
Check the fucking gate.

24:12.253 --> 24:14.555
- That's you, son. You did it.
- That's me, Daddy.

24:14.656 --> 24:16.724
- Whoa.
- I did it. I love you so much.

24:16.825 --> 24:18.425
You're great too, yeah.

24:18.526 --> 24:19.793
<i>[Kenny] If a man</i>
<i>doesn't have a dream...</i>

24:19.894 --> 24:21.193
[camera clicks]

24:21.295 --> 24:24.597
<i>...well, guess what,</i>
<i>his soul begins to die.</i>

24:24.698 --> 24:26.833
<i>So after you've</i>
<i>accomplished your dreams,</i>

24:26.934 --> 24:29.807
the best thing to do
is to come up with new dreams.

24:32.473 --> 24:35.173
<i>That way, as the years roll on,</i>

24:35.274 --> 24:37.609
<i>as they will do,</i>

24:37.710 --> 24:39.888
<i>you'll always look</i>
<i>to the future with hope.</i>

24:43.616 --> 24:47.531
<i>But of course the future's sure to
hold it's fair share of miseries.</i>

24:50.989 --> 24:53.858
[gunshot]

24:53.959 --> 24:55.593
[gunshots]

24:55.694 --> 24:59.096
[gunshot]

24:59.197 --> 25:01.031
[gasps] No.

25:01.132 --> 25:08.705
[somber music plays]

25:08.806 --> 25:11.842
[inaudible]

25:11.943 --> 25:15.278
[thunder rolls]

25:15.379 --> 25:18.988
<i>All kinds of shitty sorrows.</i>

25:48.143 --> 25:50.277
<i>I find solace in the fact</i>
<i>that from each sorrow</i>

25:50.379 --> 25:52.686
<i>comes a little bit</i>
<i>of knowledge.</i>

25:59.020 --> 26:08.328
[mechanical whirring]

26:08.429 --> 26:10.835
<i>And with knowledge</i>
<i>comes wisdom.</i>

26:13.901 --> 26:16.268
[clicking tongue]

26:16.369 --> 26:30.682
[chattering]

26:30.783 --> 26:39.457
[speaking foreign language]

26:39.559 --> 26:41.125
[speaks foreign language]

26:41.226 --> 26:43.293
<i>- [Kenny] If you're lucky...</i>
<i>-</i> [repeats foreign language]

26:43.394 --> 26:45.262
<i>...you get</i>
<i>a second act in life.</i>

26:45.363 --> 26:59.508
[cheering]

26:59.610 --> 27:02.957
- Come on, Daddy.
- Come on, Daddy.

27:15.491 --> 27:17.258
<i>[Kenny] But sooner or later,</i>

27:17.359 --> 27:19.027
<i>death will come.</i>

27:19.095 --> 27:24.216
<i>Unannounced, Old Man Reaper
comes to reclaim your soul.</i>

27:30.706 --> 27:33.173
<i>All you can hope for is
that the people you love</i>

27:33.274 --> 27:35.231
<i>will cherish the time</i>
<i>they spent with you.</i>

27:38.780 --> 27:43.618
In the end, you judge a man
by how he influenced the world.

27:43.719 --> 27:46.170
<i>You judge him by the seeds</i>
<i>he left behind.</i>

27:53.261 --> 27:56.425
<i>And you judge his seeds</i>
<i>by the harvest.</i>

28:15.281 --> 28:18.083
<i>But Kenny Powers' harvest</i>
<i>remains unknown,</i>

28:18.184 --> 28:21.330
<i>but I'm pretty goddamn</i>
<i>proud of my seeds.</i>

28:26.692 --> 28:28.660
<i>The end.</i>

28:28.761 --> 28:30.461
<i>Cut to black.</i>

28:30.562 --> 28:35.632
Audience goes fucking ape shit.

28:42.974 --> 28:44.775
It's perfect.

28:44.876 --> 28:48.845
Hmph.

28:48.946 --> 28:51.180
- Are you done yet?
- Hmm?

28:51.281 --> 28:54.616
You have been in here
for hours.

28:54.718 --> 28:58.083
Yep.
I'm finished.
