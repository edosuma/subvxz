WEBVTT

00:02.836 --> 00:07.796
The mighty Saiyans had arrived on Earth!

00:07.883 --> 00:12.252
Goku, who had been going
through training to confront them,

00:12.346 --> 00:16.430
had finally been brought
back to life by Shen Long.

00:16.517 --> 00:20.476
But it would still be another day
before he returned to Earth.

00:20.562 --> 00:24.100
Will Goku make it in time?

00:27.986 --> 00:30.898
Dokkan Dokkan We're in luck

00:30.989 --> 00:34.072
Dokkan Dokkan Paradise

00:34.159 --> 00:38.198
The Genki Dama bursts away

00:38.288 --> 00:41.621
Go Go Let's do it

00:42.835 --> 00:48.626
There's a wriggling, mysterious energy

00:48.716 --> 00:54.586
I won't hold back, just you watch

00:54.680 --> 01:00.550
l'll protect you with my life

01:00.644 --> 01:06.731
Turn your courage to love into strength

01:06.817 --> 01:12.733
We'll overcome crises with carry-through spirit

01:12.823 --> 01:19.991
The tougher your opponent is,
the greater the excitement

01:21.331 --> 01:24.198
Dokkan Dokkan We're in luck

01:24.293 --> 01:27.501
Dokkan Dokkan Now's our chance

01:27.588 --> 01:33.128
Whooshing along on the lucky wind

01:33.218 --> 01:36.085
Dokkan Dokkan We're in luck

01:36.180 --> 01:39.343
Dokkan Dokkan Tomorrow, as well

01:39.433 --> 01:46.475
Your soul already knows the answer

01:46.565 --> 01:50.183
Dragon Soul!

01:52.863 --> 01:59.029
"Yamucha's Struggle! The Terrible Saibaimen. ”

02:01.288 --> 02:03.074
W-Who are they?

02:03.165 --> 02:04.530
What are they?

02:04.625 --> 02:09.619
He called it Earth, right?
Not a bad planet, is it?

02:09.713 --> 02:14.127
How about we say hello to
the noisily peeping chicks here?

02:15.385 --> 02:17.125
(30 easy.

02:19.000 --> 02:25.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:30.359 --> 02:31.974
W-What was that?!

02:32.069 --> 02:35.527
W-What the hell have they done?!

02:37.991 --> 02:39.731
W-What the...!?

02:39.827 --> 02:42.068
|-|t's unheard-of!

02:58.679 --> 03:01.887
That greeting may have
come out a little too civil.

03:01.974 --> 03:05.808
Leave it at that, Nappa. If you get too showy,

03:05.894 --> 03:08.180
we won't be able to sell
this planet for a high price.

03:08.272 --> 03:09.512
O-Oh, right.

03:09.606 --> 03:12.097
Come to think of it, we have to look for those

03:12.192 --> 03:14.604
whatever-they're-called balls
that can grant any wish, too.

03:14.695 --> 03:17.061
Dragon Balls.

03:17.155 --> 03:19.862
First thing to do is to find
the one who killed Raditz,

03:19.950 --> 03:22.532
and get some information about
the Dragon Balls out of him.

03:22.619 --> 03:24.234
Yeah, right.

03:24.329 --> 03:29.073
But if the Dragon Balls were in this area,

03:29.167 --> 03:34.036
our wish to gain eternal life
just went up in smoke,

03:34.131 --> 03:36.747
all thanks to your mindless "greeting."

03:36.842 --> 03:41.836
S-Sorry. It completely slipped my mind.

03:41.930 --> 03:43.841
Well, what's done is done.

03:43.932 --> 03:48.016
Now, let's look for the one who
has the highest battle power.

03:48.103 --> 03:51.641
That will be the one who
killed Raditz, after all.

03:54.192 --> 03:55.443
That's strange.

03:55.527 --> 04:00.066
There are more than just one or two
battle power readings over 1,000.

04:02.117 --> 04:03.948
Why would this planet have them?

04:04.036 --> 04:07.449
Don't lose your cool.
They're still no match for us.

04:07.539 --> 04:11.782
Let's just find the one with
the highest battle power.

04:16.339 --> 04:17.921
I've found him.

04:18.007 --> 04:21.125
There are two fairly high readings together.

04:21.219 --> 04:25.337
All right, Nappa, let's go
have some fun with them.

04:33.398 --> 04:37.937
The cause of this large-scale
earthquake is still unknown.

04:38.028 --> 04:41.691
Further, we are currently unable to
make any contact with Metro East,

04:41.782 --> 04:43.647
thought to be the
epicenter of this earthquake,

04:43.742 --> 04:46.905
and there is concern for
the safety of its residents.

04:46.995 --> 04:50.408
T-They've finally gotten here!

04:50.499 --> 04:53.411
Shall we go to help? I can
tell where they are with this.

04:53.502 --> 04:56.539
Y-You'll get me to go over my dead body!

04:56.630 --> 05:02.591
l-l'm going! I'm certain that
Yamucha-sama will be going there!

05:02.678 --> 05:05.090
No, we'd better not.

05:05.180 --> 05:07.091
The difference in our levels is too great.

05:07.182 --> 05:11.016
Even if I was there, I'd just be in the way.

05:11.103 --> 05:14.971
All we can do is stay here and
hope the others are victorious.

05:15.065 --> 05:17.351
Son-kun, hurry back!

05:17.442 --> 05:19.478
Hurry back!

05:23.824 --> 05:26.987
Just hold out until I get there, guys!

05:37.254 --> 05:41.748
This is great! This planet Earth
has fairly little gravity,

05:41.842 --> 05:44.003
and I can just whip around!

05:48.724 --> 05:51.682
They're moving at incredible speed!

05:51.768 --> 05:54.225
They're heading straight for the place

05:54.312 --> 05:56.177
where those two other large Ki are.

05:56.273 --> 05:59.265
They're coming! They intend to come here!

05:59.359 --> 06:00.269
Right!

06:00.360 --> 06:03.147
Chaozu, you stay here!

06:03.238 --> 06:05.775
No way! I'm coming, too!

06:05.866 --> 06:07.527
There's nothing to fear.

06:07.617 --> 06:09.869
We've gotten so much stronger
than we were a year ago,

06:09.953 --> 06:11.614
there's no comparison.

06:11.705 --> 06:13.366
R-Right!

06:13.457 --> 06:15.698
There's something coming
from over there, too!

06:15.792 --> 06:18.249
And there are others coming this way, too!

06:18.336 --> 06:21.624
Are there more than just two Saiyans?

06:23.425 --> 06:24.335
Is that a Saiyan?

06:24.426 --> 06:27.918
Yo! Long time no see, Piccolo.

06:28.013 --> 06:31.005
Oh, it's you.

06:31.099 --> 06:33.010
What business do you have here?

06:33.101 --> 06:35.843
Have you come so you could get in our way?

06:35.937 --> 06:39.395
It looks like there are some other
fools about to come here, as well.

06:39.483 --> 06:41.474
Yeah, I'm sure everyone will be coming.

06:41.568 --> 06:44.184
I was the one who was closest.

06:44.279 --> 06:48.067
I remember! You're the one who
was at the Turtle Hermit's place.

06:48.158 --> 06:52.447
Yeah, I'm Kuririn. You've sure gone
and gotten more beefy, huh?

06:52.537 --> 06:55.449
Just like Goku, when he was a kid.

06:55.540 --> 06:57.747
You're small, but strong, right?

06:57.834 --> 07:00.041
That's what Father always used to say.

07:00.128 --> 07:02.585
You're going to fight with us, right?

07:02.672 --> 07:05.414
Goku said that, did he?

07:06.635 --> 07:09.547
That's enough chit-chat. They're here!

07:18.897 --> 07:20.933
There they are! There's one more of them.

07:21.024 --> 07:23.515
Now there are three tough-looking guys here.

07:23.610 --> 07:27.819
Apparently, they are well aware of who we are.

07:41.128 --> 07:43.619
It looks like they've been waiting for us.

07:46.007 --> 07:48.259
That's right.

07:48.343 --> 07:52.006
Just for the record, let me ask you...

07:52.097 --> 07:54.554
Why the hell are you here?

07:54.641 --> 07:56.723
That voice! | see.

07:56.810 --> 07:59.597
You're the one who killed Raditz, right?

07:59.688 --> 08:00.803
Voice?

08:00.897 --> 08:03.274
Didn't Raditz tell you?

08:04.442 --> 08:08.355
These things work as communicators, too.

08:08.446 --> 08:10.903
He's a Namekian.

08:10.991 --> 08:14.074
So it seems. I guess it's not so surprising

08:14.161 --> 08:16.948
that Raditz would have been killed by him.

08:17.038 --> 08:18.949
Namekian?

08:19.040 --> 08:22.624
Namekians, in addition to having
above-average fighting power,

08:22.711 --> 08:25.623
are said to possess some mysterious abilities.

08:27.507 --> 08:31.921
l-l'm a Namekian?

08:32.011 --> 08:34.219
I've also heard that there are some of them

08:34.306 --> 08:39.015
that perform magician-like tricks. So that's it.

08:39.102 --> 08:44.062
You must be the one who
created the Dragon Balls, right?

08:44.149 --> 08:47.312
T-They even know about the Dragon Balls?!

08:47.402 --> 08:50.815
The Dragon Balls are our main objective.

08:50.906 --> 08:53.648
Hand them over to us, nice and easy.

08:53.742 --> 09:00.329
You may be a Namekian, but you and
the others there are like bugs to us!

09:00.415 --> 09:02.201
Thanks.

09:02.292 --> 09:06.205
Because of you, I'm starting
to get an idea of my ancestry.

09:06.296 --> 09:08.878
But unfortunately for you,

09:08.965 --> 09:12.082
I'm not the one who made the Dragon Balls!

09:12.177 --> 09:16.511
I specialize more in fighting, you see.

09:18.600 --> 09:22.138
Come and see if I'm like a bug to you!

09:22.229 --> 09:23.719
Kami-sama...

09:23.813 --> 09:26.520
l-l didn't know.

09:26.608 --> 09:30.021
To think that lam an alien.

09:30.111 --> 09:34.730
No wonder I thought I was a little
different from everyone else.

09:34.824 --> 09:40.239
Indeed, I was the one who
created the Dragon Balls long ago.

09:41.873 --> 09:43.989
But even though it was
my first time making them,

09:44.084 --> 09:46.496
they seemed oddly familiar.

09:46.586 --> 09:51.376
There was probably something that
someone made on this planet "Namek,"

09:51.466 --> 09:55.129
that were like the Dragon Balls.

09:56.763 --> 09:59.379
Nappa, take off your Scouter.

09:59.474 --> 10:00.839
What?

10:00.934 --> 10:04.802
These guys alter their battle powers
in response to their fighting.

10:04.896 --> 10:07.683
These ratings aren't reliable anymore.

10:07.774 --> 10:10.265
Come to think of it, you're right.

10:10.360 --> 10:12.601
That weakling Raditz lowered his guard

10:12.696 --> 10:16.905
because of the Scouter rating,
and got himself killed.

10:18.868 --> 10:22.360
R-Raditz is that Saiyan that
you and Goku teamed up on,

10:22.455 --> 10:25.538
and just barely managed to beat, right?

10:25.625 --> 10:26.956
And he's a weakling?

10:27.043 --> 10:31.503
I know. Let's have a look
at these guys in action.

10:31.589 --> 10:35.707
Hey, Nappa, we still have six Saibaimen, right?

10:35.802 --> 10:37.508
Get them out.

10:37.595 --> 10:40.382
Vegeta, you like playing around too, huh?

10:40.473 --> 10:41.849
S-Saibaimen?

10:41.933 --> 10:44.595
W-What are those?

10:44.686 --> 10:46.722
There are six of them, all right.

10:46.813 --> 10:50.852
This soil will grow some fine Saibaimen.

10:55.447 --> 10:58.234
W-What are those?!

10:58.325 --> 10:59.940
There.

11:10.545 --> 11:13.833
T-Those guys are disgusting!

11:43.370 --> 11:47.909
Your targets are those three.
Work them over, Saibaimen!

12:32.168 --> 12:34.329
Gohan, don't lose your nerve!

12:34.421 --> 12:35.957
Right!

12:40.009 --> 12:42.000
You want us to start coming after you, now?

12:42.095 --> 12:43.881
Kuririn!

12:48.977 --> 12:50.558
Tenshinhan!

12:52.439 --> 12:54.350
Mm-hmm.

12:54.441 --> 12:57.183
I thought there were only two Saiyans.

12:57.277 --> 13:00.815
Well, a lot has happened,
and there's more of them now.

13:00.905 --> 13:03.897
It's all the same, no matter
how many of them there are.

13:03.992 --> 13:06.904
Is that him? Goku's son?

13:06.995 --> 13:10.658
Yeah. It looks like Piccolo
has trained him quite a bit.

13:17.547 --> 13:20.038
Kuririn, sorry I'm late.

13:20.133 --> 13:21.293
Yamucha-san!

13:21.384 --> 13:23.340
Everyone's here but Goku.

13:23.428 --> 13:28.138
1... 2... 3... 4... 5... 6...

13:28.224 --> 13:33.093
Interesting. That's exactly the
number of Saibaimen we have.

13:33.188 --> 13:34.598
What do you guys say?

13:34.689 --> 13:39.524
How about each of you
fight our soldiers in turn?

13:39.611 --> 13:41.272
It will be a game.

13:42.572 --> 13:44.358
A game?! Rubbish!

13:44.449 --> 13:46.405
Enough of your beating around the bush,

13:46.493 --> 13:48.575
let's settle this, right now!

13:48.661 --> 13:53.030
Now, now, why not? It works out to our favor.

13:53.124 --> 13:56.537
Goku isn't here yet, after all.

13:56.628 --> 13:58.164
Fine with me.

13:58.254 --> 14:02.463
I'll take you on first. Come and get me!

14:05.595 --> 14:07.426
This guy is gonna be floored

14:07.514 --> 14:11.223
once he finds out how
strong the Saibaimen are!

14:12.894 --> 14:17.763
You go first. Hit him as
hard as you can. Got it?

14:33.373 --> 14:34.909
Gohan!

14:45.426 --> 14:47.166
You got him!

14:47.262 --> 14:49.423
That's our Tenshinhan!

14:50.557 --> 14:52.218
Amazing!

14:57.939 --> 15:01.852
I-Impossible! The Saibaimen's
battle power is 1,200!

15:01.943 --> 15:04.730
They rival Raditz when it comes to power!

15:04.821 --> 15:08.530
That just means that
his battle power is higher.

15:08.616 --> 15:10.481
B-But...

15:11.786 --> 15:13.287
It's a simple miscalculation.

15:13.371 --> 15:16.033
That's not what our data says!

15:16.124 --> 15:17.955
Nappa, these guys look like

15:18.042 --> 15:21.000
they can provide us with a little entertainment.

15:32.932 --> 15:35.844
V-Vegeta, how could you do that?

15:35.935 --> 15:39.302
That Saibaiman underestimated his opponent.

15:40.773 --> 15:44.436
I told him to go after him as hard as he could.

15:44.527 --> 15:46.984
W-What a creep!

15:47.071 --> 15:51.440
T-That Saiyan blew that monster
to pieces in an instant.

15:51.534 --> 15:53.741
What destructive force!

15:53.828 --> 15:56.661
Well, who is next?

15:56.748 --> 15:59.740
A-All right, I'll take you on!

15:59.834 --> 16:00.619
Wait, Kuririn.

16:00.668 --> 16:02.374
Y-Yamucha-san?

16:02.462 --> 16:04.669
Let me go first.

16:04.756 --> 16:08.624
I want to show them that we've
had it with their playing around.

16:08.718 --> 16:11.050
Yamucha-san, I could just as well--

16:11.137 --> 16:14.220
You've already been brought back
to life with the Dragon Balls once.

16:14.307 --> 16:18.391
If anything were to happen,
you couldn't be brought back again.

16:18.478 --> 16:20.594
Let me take care of this.

16:20.688 --> 16:24.021
I'm going to get rid of the
remaining five all at once.

16:24.108 --> 16:26.565
Such a lovely friendship we're seeing.

16:26.653 --> 16:29.440
All right, you take him on.

16:29.530 --> 16:33.739
Okay, come and get me!
Don't go taking us so lightly!

16:35.912 --> 16:38.369
What is this weird uneasiness?

16:38.456 --> 16:39.992
I've got a bad feeling about this.

16:40.083 --> 16:43.575
Piccolo, find a way to
hold out until I get there.

16:43.670 --> 16:45.376
Please!

16:51.219 --> 16:53.505
T-They vanished!

16:53.596 --> 16:56.508
You fool! They're moving at high speed!

16:56.599 --> 16:58.339
Sense out the movement of their Ki!

16:58.434 --> 17:00.971
T-The movement of their Ki?

17:01.062 --> 17:03.804
Everyone besides you can see them.

17:03.898 --> 17:06.435
Eh? Everyone can see them?

17:06.526 --> 17:08.608
All right...!

17:08.694 --> 17:11.983
Use your whole body as your eyes.

17:12.073 --> 17:15.281
Use my whole body as my eyes...

17:30.550 --> 17:32.290
You see them?

17:38.808 --> 17:40.469
I see them!

17:56.826 --> 17:58.441
You're not getting away!

18:11.299 --> 18:12.664
You got him!

18:12.759 --> 18:14.374
A-Amazing...

18:14.469 --> 18:16.050
H-He did it!

18:16.137 --> 18:18.128
The earthlings have the upper hand!

18:18.222 --> 18:20.087
He did it!

18:20.183 --> 18:24.392
He did it, he did it!

18:31.486 --> 18:33.351
Not again!

18:39.869 --> 18:45.239
Hmph, it looks like these monsters
aren't as strong as you think.

18:45.333 --> 18:46.914
W-What did you say?!

18:47.001 --> 18:49.333
Don't get excited, Nappa.

18:49.420 --> 18:53.789
I'll take care of the remaining
four myself, as well.

18:56.427 --> 18:57.462
It looks like this time,

18:57.553 --> 18:59.805
you're the one who
underestimated the Saibaiman.

18:59.889 --> 19:01.345
What?!

19:06.938 --> 19:08.974
O-Oh, crap!

19:22.286 --> 19:24.197
T-This is bad.

19:31.546 --> 19:33.127
Yamucha!

19:37.301 --> 19:40.418
Yes. That's more like it.

19:40.513 --> 19:44.552
W-What a monster! He blew himself up!

19:48.187 --> 19:50.269
T-That's awful...

20:01.617 --> 20:05.360
H-He's dead...

20:05.454 --> 20:09.288
Yamucha-sama! Yamucha-sama!

20:09.375 --> 20:12.583
Yamucha-sama!

20:12.670 --> 20:17.460
Yamucha-sama! Yamucha-sama!

20:17.550 --> 20:19.916
Yamucha-sama!

20:21.721 --> 20:25.213
Yamucha-sama!

20:25.308 --> 20:28.596
Y-Yamucha-san must have
had a bad feeling about this.

20:28.686 --> 20:34.647
T-That's why he went
instead of me... Damn it...

20:36.861 --> 20:42.857
Damn it! What am I supposed
to tell Pu-erh and Bulma-san?!

20:42.950 --> 20:46.943
What a pathetic Saibaiman! A draw?!

20:47.038 --> 20:50.030
What did he think he was doing,
against scum like that?!

20:50.124 --> 20:54.959
Hey, get that filthy, tattered mess cleaned up.

20:57.798 --> 21:00.665
D-Damn you!

21:00.760 --> 21:03.297
Everyone, stand back!

21:05.473 --> 21:06.929
Yamucha-san,

21:07.016 --> 21:09.928
I will make sure I avenge you.

21:12.480 --> 21:15.847
Let me show you the results of my training!

21:19.111 --> 21:23.275
Yamucha's death came out of the blue.

21:23.366 --> 21:29.908
With his anger exploding, what are
the results of Kuririn's training?

21:31.916 --> 21:34.828
Yeah! Break! Care! Break! As hard as you can

21:34.919 --> 21:39.413
Fly away into the boundless skies

21:39.507 --> 21:42.340
We'll hitch a ride on the jet stream,

21:42.426 --> 21:45.463
and zip away to wherever we want

21:45.554 --> 21:47.806
Being a daredevil is the best

21:47.890 --> 21:51.223
Let's go tip-top! All right?

21:51.310 --> 21:57.101
This eye-opening blue Earth of ours

21:57.191 --> 22:03.278
is our irreplaceable world,
and we're not giving it up

22:04.657 --> 22:07.615
Blast offa Kamehame-Ha

22:07.702 --> 22:10.865
You were born

22:10.955 --> 22:16.575
to protect the world in these uncertain times

22:16.669 --> 22:19.581
Yeah! Break! Care! Break! As hard as you can

22:19.672 --> 22:22.789
Go at it full power

22:22.883 --> 22:26.842
Hope is my weapon,

22:26.929 --> 22:30.171
so believe in the future

22:34.520 --> 22:36.181
Heya! I'm Goku!

22:36.272 --> 22:38.684
Just a little farther. Sit tight, everyone!

22:38.774 --> 22:41.937
What are you thinking, Chaozu?!
Don't do anything stupid!

22:42.028 --> 22:44.644
Ch-Chaozu-san!

22:44.739 --> 22:47.981
Chaozu, I won't leave you there feeling lonely!

22:48.075 --> 22:51.488
Take this, Saiyan! My final technique!

22:51.579 --> 22:53.570
Next time on Dragon Ball Z Kai,

22:53.664 --> 22:57.327
"Sit Tight, Chaozu!
Tenshinhan's Screaming Kikoho. "

22:57.418 --> 23:00.080
Come quickly, Father!
