WEBVTT

00:04.130 --> 00:05.763
He's on the move.

00:05.765 --> 00:08.750
Heading south on Broadway
towards 46th Street.

00:11.087 --> 00:12.220
Cuckoo!

00:12.222 --> 00:13.521
You're screwed!

00:14.524 --> 00:15.857
(grunts)

00:15.859 --> 00:17.308
All right, all right,
all right.

00:17.310 --> 00:19.477
(squawks)
Calm down.

00:19.479 --> 00:20.862
I'm Lieutenant McCarthy, sir.
How are you doing today?

00:20.864 --> 00:23.231
And I'm crazy! Sir!

00:23.233 --> 00:24.449
Why don't you just step down,

00:24.451 --> 00:25.950
and we can talk, okay?

00:25.952 --> 00:27.652
No, no, no. Screw you!

00:27.654 --> 00:29.404
And you! And you!

00:29.406 --> 00:30.955
All of you!

00:30.957 --> 00:33.207
What are you looking at, huh?

00:33.209 --> 00:34.575
(man spits, crowd gasps)

00:34.577 --> 00:35.874
Food for the needy!
Hey, hey! Come on now.

00:35.875 --> 00:37.855
Not for the greedy!

00:37.856 --> 00:38.547
Move the perimeter back
50 feet immediately.

00:38.548 --> 00:42.333
Food for the needy!
Not for the greedy!

00:42.335 --> 00:44.919
Screw you! Come on.
See if you can lay a hand on him, okay?

00:44.921 --> 00:46.421
Screw you all!
Sir, you need

00:46.423 --> 00:48.423
to step down immediately, okay?

00:48.425 --> 00:50.925
(man making martial arts sounds)

00:50.927 --> 00:53.327
Yah! Hey!
Get away from me.

00:53.329 --> 00:54.812
Sir, get down.
Don't you touch me.

00:54.814 --> 00:57.465
I'll kick your ass.
You want some money?

00:57.467 --> 01:00.501
Ow! Mommy!
Hey, watch the girl.

01:00.503 --> 01:02.854
Yah! Hah!
Use the stun gun.

01:02.856 --> 01:06.274
Price check! Price check!
Price check!

01:06.276 --> 01:07.658
Price check!

01:07.660 --> 01:09.327
(stun gun clicking)
Price check!

01:09.329 --> 01:11.362
(tires screeching,
people screaming)

01:13.700 --> 01:15.583
Oh, God.

01:17.587 --> 01:19.087
Do you know
what Monday is?

01:19.089 --> 01:20.371
No.

01:20.373 --> 01:22.256
The anniversary...

01:22.258 --> 01:23.591
Whose?

01:23.593 --> 01:25.293
Ours.

01:26.179 --> 01:28.096
What?
As partners.

01:28.098 --> 01:31.048
It's been exactly a year,
which means--

01:31.050 --> 01:34.352
Monday, my probationary period
is officially over.

01:35.972 --> 01:37.021
Congratulations.

01:37.023 --> 01:38.973
Thank you.

01:38.975 --> 01:40.558
Where you gonna take me?

01:42.228 --> 01:45.113
Oh, first of all, you <i> know</i>
you lucked out with me.

01:45.115 --> 01:46.697
Second of all, we need
to celebrate the fact

01:46.699 --> 01:48.149
that I'm now
officially your equal.

01:48.151 --> 01:49.567
Let's not go too far.

01:49.569 --> 01:51.652
I've still got a lot more hours
on the job.

01:51.654 --> 01:53.821
Mm-hmm.
DISPATCHER: 12-David, be advised.

01:53.823 --> 01:56.045
We're receiving a 52,
domestic disturbance,

01:56.070 --> 01:56.826
Oh, man.

01:56.826 --> 01:58.242
at 190 West End Avenue.

01:58.244 --> 02:01.245
Why is it every time
I'm eating... we get a job?

02:01.247 --> 02:03.865
Maybe 'cause
you're always eating.

02:04.751 --> 02:06.284
Oh...

02:07.620 --> 02:09.287
Happy dust,

02:09.288 --> 02:11.289
pebbles, pills,

02:11.291 --> 02:12.457
hash,

02:12.459 --> 02:14.175
meth.

02:14.177 --> 02:15.460
You seeing this?

02:15.462 --> 02:17.795
There's got to be $30 million
worth of drugs here.

02:17.797 --> 02:19.797
It's got to be
a hundred degrees out, Reagan.

02:19.799 --> 02:23.017
Will you come on, lighten up.

02:23.019 --> 02:24.051
It's overtime.

02:24.053 --> 02:25.720
Besides, I brought you
an iced coffee.

02:25.722 --> 02:27.121
Rick Siblano, DEA.

02:27.123 --> 02:29.474
Susan Martinez,
one of our lab techs.

02:29.476 --> 02:31.943
Just for the record,
this guy never buys <i> me</i> a coffee.

02:31.945 --> 02:33.895
She'll be driving the truck.

02:33.897 --> 02:36.564
Just for the record, this guy
never lets anyone else drive.

02:36.566 --> 02:37.982
Come on. She's just mad

02:37.984 --> 02:39.901
'cause I talked her into
the detail, that's all.

02:39.903 --> 02:41.819
So, what's
the story here?

02:41.821 --> 02:44.205
We're going to, uh, escort
$30 million in confiscated drugs

02:44.207 --> 02:45.706
with just a truck
and two unmarked cars?

02:45.708 --> 02:46.908
Is that the plan?

02:46.910 --> 02:48.543
Yeah, it keeps it
under the radar.

02:48.545 --> 02:52.046
It's all overtime for me--
I got to get my kid new braces.

02:53.833 --> 02:55.550
All right, let's hit the road.

02:55.552 --> 02:57.685
We'll be the follow car.

02:58.671 --> 03:00.004
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

03:00.006 --> 03:03.341
Whoa, whoa.
You've got shotgun.

03:07.981 --> 03:09.430
(siren wailing)

03:09.432 --> 03:11.432
MAN: You think I'm stupid, huh?
(woman gasps)

03:11.434 --> 03:13.184
Why is he calling you?
Stop it.

03:13.186 --> 03:14.535
Police!
You think I'm dumb? Huh?

03:14.537 --> 03:15.703
Hey!
You think I'm stupid?

03:15.705 --> 03:18.022
You think I'm stupid?
Stop! Hey!

03:18.024 --> 03:19.023
Sir, step back.
He's crazy!

03:19.025 --> 03:20.408
Sir, I said step back.
All right.

03:20.410 --> 03:22.577
You want to tell me what's going on?
She's a lying bitch!

03:22.579 --> 03:23.995
Okay, who is she?
Is she your girlfriend?

03:23.997 --> 03:25.162
What are you saying?
And then...

03:25.164 --> 03:27.331
Know what? Don't worry
about her. Calm down.

03:27.333 --> 03:29.500
Hey. Settle down now.
WOMAN: I didn't do anything.

03:29.502 --> 03:31.285
Get the hell
away from me.

03:31.287 --> 03:32.787
(grunts)

03:32.789 --> 03:36.290
Hey, hey, hey, back up, back up.
Stop. Stop!

03:36.292 --> 03:38.593
Jamie. Jamie.
What are you doing?

03:38.595 --> 03:40.378
You're hurting him.

03:40.380 --> 03:42.263
(screams) Stop!
Hey, hey, hey.

03:42.265 --> 03:43.714
Calm down.

03:43.716 --> 03:45.182
Let go of me.
Calm down, hey.

03:45.184 --> 03:47.885
Where's the tough guy now, huh?

03:48.972 --> 03:50.137
Enough!

03:51.274 --> 03:53.808
RENZULLI:
You-- step away.

03:53.810 --> 03:55.560
And you--

03:55.562 --> 03:57.511
you're under arrest, genius.

Advertise your product or brand here

04:16.165 --> 04:18.632
It was a judgment call.

04:18.635 --> 04:20.834
It was a <i> bad</i>
judgment call.

04:20.837 --> 04:22.837
He caused the death
of an innocent civilian.

04:22.839 --> 04:24.972
Innocent? The guy was
a threat to pedestrians

04:24.974 --> 04:26.641
and to my officers.

04:26.643 --> 04:27.758
Frank, this is neglect.

04:27.760 --> 04:30.227
Criminal neglect,
reckless endangerment.

04:30.229 --> 04:33.564
You're fitting him for a noose.

04:33.566 --> 04:36.651
McCarthy's facing a charge of
criminally negligent homicide.

04:36.653 --> 04:38.319
What happened
to an investigation?

04:38.321 --> 04:41.489
The DA will decide to indict
based on their findings.

04:41.491 --> 04:42.773
And they're requesting

04:42.775 --> 04:45.493
that you not speak with
McCarthy, pending that decision.

04:47.363 --> 04:50.748
You're telling me not
to speak to my own men?

04:52.619 --> 04:54.752
Frank, that's exactly
what I'm telling you.

04:56.289 --> 04:58.122
How do you want
to handle the press?

04:58.124 --> 05:00.091
My office will schedule
a press conference.

05:00.093 --> 05:02.243
Am I allowed to speak at that?

05:02.245 --> 05:04.595
Or should I just smile and nod?

05:04.597 --> 05:07.598
Frank, if that were
only possible.

05:13.139 --> 05:14.855
When you and Linda go out
in the car together,

05:14.857 --> 05:15.973
do you always drive?

05:15.975 --> 05:18.225
Most of the time.

05:18.227 --> 05:19.727
What's “most of the time”?

05:19.729 --> 05:21.529
50 percent? 90 percent?

05:21.531 --> 05:23.114
I mean, I'm just curious.

05:23.116 --> 05:26.200
I drive her 99.9
percent of the time.

05:26.202 --> 05:28.452
She's a lousy driver. Why?

05:28.454 --> 05:31.072
What's going on with you, huh?

05:35.578 --> 05:37.328
(groans)

05:39.749 --> 05:41.832
(grunts)

05:45.138 --> 05:46.470
You okay?

05:46.472 --> 05:49.256
I don't know, I don't know.
You all right?

05:49.258 --> 05:51.926
5-4 detectives to Central.
(groans)

05:51.928 --> 05:53.978
(gunshots)
We got shots fired!

05:53.980 --> 05:55.896
It's an ambush.
Stay down. Stay down.

05:55.898 --> 05:57.264
Get your piece out.

05:57.266 --> 06:00.067
(gunfire continues)
Stay down!

GARRETT: The warm hospitality

in inverse proportion to the
time you keep them waiting.

07:53.340 --> 07:55.173
No grandstanding,
Mr. Mayor.

07:55.175 --> 07:57.092
Frank, I can't stand,
grand or otherwise.

07:57.094 --> 07:58.343
You know

We're already

08:05.185 --> 08:07.068
I'll meet you up ahead.

08:12.909 --> 08:14.776
Now, we have a deal--

08:14.778 --> 08:17.829
I don't speak to my lieutenant
about the incident,

08:17.831 --> 08:21.116
and you don't hang him out
to dry with the press, right?

08:21.118 --> 08:24.969
Frank, I certainly don't have
that intention.

08:29.176 --> 08:31.543
Commissioner, please?

08:34.631 --> 08:38.717
We are working with the DEA
to locate the perpetrators.

08:38.719 --> 08:41.770
We do not have a description
of the suspects at this time.

08:41.772 --> 08:43.788
(reporters shouting)
Commissioner, Commissioner,

08:43.789 --> 08:46.057
can you comment on the incident
in Times Square?

08:46.059 --> 08:47.892
Per NYPD guidelines,

08:47.894 --> 08:51.146
Lieutenant McCarthy has been
placed on modified assignment.

08:51.148 --> 08:53.832
But this is an
ongoing investigation.

08:53.834 --> 08:55.734
Has McCarthy's gun
been taken away?

08:55.736 --> 09:00.488
Yes, Helen, that's part of what
modified assignment entails.

09:00.490 --> 09:02.624
(shouting questions)

09:02.626 --> 09:03.875
The family is saying

09:03.877 --> 09:06.494
that Mr. Stapleton is a victim
of mental illness,

09:06.496 --> 09:09.547
but he was not violent,
and he was not aggressive.

09:09.549 --> 09:10.982
What would you say
to the family?

09:10.984 --> 09:12.383
Well, I...

09:12.385 --> 09:15.336
What we would say is that the
city would like to apologize

09:15.338 --> 09:18.173
to the Stapleton family
for this tragic mistake.

09:18.175 --> 09:20.742
You used the term
“mistake,” Mr. Mayor.

09:20.744 --> 09:22.177
Is that how
you see it?

09:22.179 --> 09:24.562
Christian, I think we can all
agree that the use of force--

09:24.564 --> 09:26.581
be it firearms
or stun guns--

09:26.583 --> 09:28.783
is a measure
that should only be used

09:28.785 --> 09:31.002
when all other means
have been exhausted, right?

09:31.004 --> 09:33.188

Hey. How you doing?

09:41.782 --> 09:44.783
I know you well enough to know
you've already grilled everybody

09:44.785 --> 09:47.118
on your way in here to find out
how I'm doing.

09:47.120 --> 09:50.038
At least you didn't break
anything.

09:53.460 --> 09:55.593
Suppose if it was you driving,

09:55.595 --> 09:58.012
it would be me laying here
instead.

09:59.516 --> 10:00.965
Reagan, look.

10:00.967 --> 10:05.103
I'm sorry I pressured you
into doing the detail.

10:06.389 --> 10:09.023
No, you're not sorry, Danny.

10:09.025 --> 10:10.475
You make decisions

10:10.477 --> 10:13.027
<i>all</i> the time without any regard
to how I feel about it.

10:14.197 --> 10:17.398
You know, I make decisions
based on what I think is right.

10:17.400 --> 10:21.286
Yeah, exactly.
What <i> you</i> think is right.

10:23.490 --> 10:27.292
I didn't... know you felt
this way.

10:39.923 --> 10:41.840
You want to finish
the booking sheet?

10:41.842 --> 10:44.092
No, I want to talk
about what happened.

10:46.346 --> 10:47.679
What do you mean?

10:47.681 --> 10:49.597
Let's walk.

10:51.518 --> 10:54.686
You just went off
on that guy.

10:54.688 --> 10:56.354
What was I
supposed to do?

10:56.356 --> 10:58.489
You were supposed
to let me handle it.

10:58.491 --> 11:00.074
Wait, let me get
this straight.

11:00.076 --> 11:02.026
You're mad because I reacted
too quickly to a guy

11:02.028 --> 11:04.162
that beat up his girlfriend
and knocked you off your feet?

11:04.164 --> 11:07.332
You made it look like
I couldn't handle myself.

11:07.334 --> 11:09.117
In front of the boss, no less.

11:09.119 --> 11:10.869
RENZULLI: Reagan.

11:10.871 --> 11:13.037

11:24.801 --> 11:27.101
How's everything going with you?

11:27.103 --> 11:28.386
Hmm?

11:28.388 --> 11:30.221
What's this about, Sarge?

11:31.524 --> 11:33.474
You got a thing
for your partner?

11:35.729 --> 11:37.061
No.

11:37.063 --> 11:39.731
'Cause when I rolled up
on that domestic today

11:39.733 --> 11:42.567
you were acting like a guy
defending his girlfriend,

11:42.569 --> 11:44.786
not a police officer
defending his partner.

11:44.788 --> 11:46.905
And the difference

11:46.907 --> 11:49.123
between the two
could get you killed.

11:49.125 --> 11:51.409
He had knocked
my partner to the ground.

11:52.462 --> 11:53.661
What was I supposed to do?

11:53.663 --> 11:56.297
What I would've done
is head over there

11:56.299 --> 11:58.416
and give her a hand
if she needed it.

11:58.418 --> 12:00.168
I used necessary force.

12:00.170 --> 12:02.420
You most certainly did.

12:02.422 --> 12:04.088
Would that amount of force
have been necessary

12:04.090 --> 12:05.256
if I was your partner?

12:05.258 --> 12:07.558
I think it would.

12:07.560 --> 12:08.977
(sighs)

12:08.979 --> 12:10.395
There's not a boss on the job

12:10.397 --> 12:11.980
that's gonna allow
partners to date

12:11.982 --> 12:13.564
or be romantically involved.

12:13.566 --> 12:15.400
'Cause once you have feelings
towards your partner,

12:15.402 --> 12:17.819
your judgment gets impaired.

12:17.821 --> 12:20.772
So I want you
to go home

12:20.774 --> 12:21.990
and think real hard about

12:21.992 --> 12:23.741
your feelings
towards Officer Janko.

12:25.328 --> 12:26.778
And if you decide

12:26.780 --> 12:30.448
you got these romantic
feelings towards her...

12:30.450 --> 12:33.751
then I'm gonna assign you
a new partner.

12:39.960 --> 12:41.426
What the hell are
you looking at?

12:41.428 --> 12:42.627
Reagan!
What?

12:42.629 --> 12:44.429
What the hell's wrong with you?
Nothing.

12:44.431 --> 12:46.297
Something.

12:46.299 --> 12:48.299
I'm-I'm hotheaded, okay?

12:48.301 --> 12:49.851
I'm hotheaded
and I don't consider

12:49.853 --> 12:50.969
anyone else's feelings.

12:50.971 --> 12:53.187
It's not your fault
Baez got banged up.

12:53.189 --> 12:54.472
Yeah? Try telling
her that.

12:54.474 --> 12:55.556
She saying it is?

12:55.558 --> 12:57.525
Not in so many words.

12:57.527 --> 12:58.776
Hell, maybe she's right.

12:58.778 --> 13:00.028
Maybe that's why I burn
through so many partners.

13:00.030 --> 13:01.779
Come on. You're a
damn good cop.

13:01.781 --> 13:03.815
And as far as I know,
there's no medal

13:03.817 --> 13:06.150
One PP gives out
for congeniality.

13:06.152 --> 13:08.319
Screw it!

13:08.321 --> 13:09.320
What the hell's bugging you?

13:09.322 --> 13:11.572
I'm pissed off.

13:11.574 --> 13:13.458
Obviously.

13:13.460 --> 13:14.909
Any leads on the drugs?

13:14.911 --> 13:16.411
The DEA's on it.
But if you think I'm gonna

13:16.413 --> 13:17.996
sit around with my thumb
up my ass, you're crazy.

13:17.998 --> 13:19.163
You saw it go down.

13:19.165 --> 13:20.715
It's yours. Have at it.

13:20.717 --> 13:21.883
Someone has a problem with it,

13:21.885 --> 13:23.551
you let 'em
talk to me.

13:23.553 --> 13:25.253
(phone ringing)

13:25.255 --> 13:27.638
You should stay pissed off
more often.

13:27.640 --> 13:29.807
Reagan.

13:31.428 --> 13:32.894
You're kidding me.

13:32.896 --> 13:34.846
No, no, I'm on my way.
Sarge!

13:34.848 --> 13:36.014
Yeah?

13:36.016 --> 13:38.182
They found the truck.

13:40.487 --> 13:43.521
(siren wailing)

13:44.407 --> 13:46.524
What do we got?

13:46.526 --> 13:48.526
It's cleared out.
Every box.

13:48.528 --> 13:50.328
CSU's dusting
for prints.

13:50.330 --> 13:51.746
What about Martinez?

14:01.007 --> 14:04.375
She was shot execution-style,
in the back of the head.

14:07.714 --> 14:09.881
I'm sorry.

14:11.468 --> 14:13.684
(sighs)

14:25.621 --> 14:27.271
<i>New York Times</i> just ran a piece

14:27.273 --> 14:29.507
on the Stapleton case.

14:29.509 --> 14:30.808
(sighs)

14:30.810 --> 14:32.343
I'll get this out momentarily.

14:32.345 --> 14:34.295
Do I want
to read it?

14:34.297 --> 14:36.630
No. They cited every
excessive force complaint

14:36.632 --> 14:37.948
we've had in the past year.

14:37.950 --> 14:40.051
I just watched
New York One's coverage.

14:40.053 --> 14:42.920
They used the term “unprovoked”
three times in two minutes.

14:42.922 --> 14:45.356
Do you have any more
good news, Garrett?

14:45.358 --> 14:46.891
The Stapleton family announced

14:46.893 --> 14:48.692
they're suing the NYPD.

14:50.613 --> 14:53.030
So alert the corporate counsel.

14:53.032 --> 14:54.532
I want you to promise

14:54.534 --> 14:55.983
you're not gonna talk
to Lieutenant McCarthy.

14:55.985 --> 14:57.985
Not gonna.
Not gonna promise

14:57.987 --> 14:59.120
or not gonna talk to him?

14:59.122 --> 15:01.155
Both.

15:02.375 --> 15:04.658
Sir, Sergeant Gormley
has arrived.

15:04.660 --> 15:06.460
Let's have him.

15:08.831 --> 15:09.831
Commissioner Reagan.

15:09.832 --> 15:10.965
Sergeant.

15:10.967 --> 15:12.466
Deputy Commissioner
Moore.

15:12.468 --> 15:13.667
Sergeant.

15:13.669 --> 15:15.836
Is there progress
on the drug heist?

15:15.838 --> 15:17.721
CSU's going through
the van we recovered

15:17.723 --> 15:20.091
with a fine-tooth comb,
as you can imagine.

15:20.093 --> 15:21.392
They'll expedite
the prints

15:21.394 --> 15:23.844
and we should hear
something this afternoon.

15:23.846 --> 15:25.729
But that's not why
I'm here to see you.

15:30.153 --> 15:33.070
Think I'...
go put out some fires.

15:33.072 --> 15:35.239
Before you get
a chance to stoke them.

15:37.743 --> 15:39.660
(door opens)

15:39.662 --> 15:41.028
Sit down.

15:41.030 --> 15:42.863
(door closes)

15:43.749 --> 15:46.250
I'm here about
Lieutenant McCarthy.

15:49.755 --> 15:51.705
Do you have information
on the incident?

15:51.707 --> 15:53.707
He was my partner
for five years,

15:53.709 --> 15:54.875
back when I was in Vice.

15:54.877 --> 15:57.511
Couldn't meet a better cop
or a nicer guy.

15:57.513 --> 15:58.846
No?

15:58.848 --> 16:02.383
Well, that's not why
he was on modified assignment.

16:02.385 --> 16:05.936
Right. He was modified
for doing his job.

16:06.772 --> 16:08.139
He didn't follow protocol.

16:08.141 --> 16:09.773
He <i> did</i> follow protocol.

16:09.775 --> 16:11.275
He assessed the situation,

16:11.277 --> 16:12.893
he assessed a danger,

16:12.895 --> 16:14.278
he set up
a perimeter,

16:14.280 --> 16:15.779
he called ESU.

16:15.781 --> 16:17.898
He tried to coax the man down,

16:17.900 --> 16:18.900
and when that failed,

16:18.901 --> 16:20.868
he ordered Stapleton
to be stunned.

16:20.870 --> 16:23.988
Well, the investigation
is ongoing.

16:23.990 --> 16:27.124
Yes, I heard your statement
at the press conference.

16:27.126 --> 16:28.659
But what was missing

16:28.661 --> 16:30.628
was you putting this whole thing
into perspective

16:30.630 --> 16:32.580
for the media
vultures out there

16:32.582 --> 16:34.665
who are looking
for any opportunity

16:34.667 --> 16:36.634
to tear down cops!

16:39.639 --> 16:41.338
You have no idea

16:41.340 --> 16:43.474
what goes into
those press conferences.

16:43.476 --> 16:45.926
Well, I know what doesn't.

16:45.928 --> 16:48.312
The truth.

16:50.833 --> 16:53.267
You're done, Sergeant.

16:53.269 --> 16:54.935
Don't say another word.

17:00.610 --> 17:02.776
(door opens)

17:02.778 --> 17:06.079
(door closes)

17:09.502 --> 17:13.503
DANNY:
S-A-N-C-H-E-Z.

17:13.506 --> 17:14.954
Yeah, I got it.
Thanks.

17:23.266 --> 17:25.182
Thought you were out sick.

17:25.184 --> 17:27.800
Well, I'm back.

17:27.803 --> 17:29.853
(groans softly)

17:30.773 --> 17:32.773
We got a hit
on the print from the truck.

17:32.775 --> 17:35.109
Ramon Sanchez.

17:38.814 --> 17:40.898
BAEZ:
Assault, drug possession,

17:40.900 --> 17:42.283
attempted murder...

17:43.869 --> 17:45.819
And he's a member of Mara Noche.

17:45.821 --> 17:47.621
He was
arrested

17:47.623 --> 17:49.123
November of last year.

17:49.125 --> 17:51.292
BAEZ:
According to this,

17:51.294 --> 17:53.494
he got bail, but skipped out

17:53.496 --> 17:54.912
on his court date.

17:54.914 --> 17:56.213
There's an
outstanding warrant.

17:59.502 --> 18:01.552
I think I found someone
we can bring in.

18:01.554 --> 18:03.637
He was arrested
with Sanchez

18:03.639 --> 18:06.340
July 2013 and we know him...

18:06.342 --> 18:07.841
very intimately.

18:09.061 --> 18:11.178
Your brother.

18:11.180 --> 18:12.730
Javi.

18:29.081 --> 18:30.081
Hey.

18:31.033 --> 18:32.449
Hey. What are you doing here?

18:32.451 --> 18:34.868
Just came by to say “hey,”
but it looks like you're busy.

18:34.870 --> 18:36.203
Yeah, well...

18:36.205 --> 18:37.871
I'm running out to
interview a witness.

18:37.873 --> 18:40.007
All right, well, we'll catch up
some other time.

18:40.009 --> 18:42.876
Okay, well,
witness is at Rikers

18:42.878 --> 18:44.094
so I guess if I'm late,

18:44.096 --> 18:46.013
it's not like
he's going anywhere.

18:47.717 --> 18:49.550
Sit.

18:49.552 --> 18:50.718
Okay.

18:55.057 --> 18:56.390
How's everything
at work?

18:57.393 --> 18:59.560
Good.
Yeah?

18:59.562 --> 19:00.894
Everything else?

19:00.896 --> 19:02.780
Good.

19:04.567 --> 19:06.700
Okay, start singing, buster.

19:09.822 --> 19:12.873
I responded to
a domestic dispute yesterday.

19:12.875 --> 19:15.492
Guy put his hands on my partner,
so I went after him.

19:15.494 --> 19:16.994
My sergeant
walks up while

19:16.996 --> 19:18.495
I'm wrestling around
with this guy,

19:18.497 --> 19:20.331
and the next thing I know,
I'm in his office

19:20.333 --> 19:22.383
and he's accusing me of having
romantic feelings for Eddie

19:22.385 --> 19:24.251
and threatening
to terminate my partnership.

19:25.087 --> 19:27.304
Do you have feelings for her?

19:28.808 --> 19:30.341
She's a real pain.

19:30.343 --> 19:32.559
I mean, she's always trying
to tell me what to do.

19:32.561 --> 19:34.895
She eats too much,
she's opinionated,

19:34.897 --> 19:36.230
she never listens

19:36.232 --> 19:38.098
and she's constantly
making plans for me

19:38.100 --> 19:39.316
without consulting me.

19:39.318 --> 19:41.485
So you do have feelings for her.

19:42.772 --> 19:44.321
I... weren't you listening?

19:46.158 --> 19:48.909
You have to remember that I was
there for your first crush.

19:48.911 --> 19:50.327
Theresa Mancini.

19:50.329 --> 19:52.496
And she was bossy
and opinionated

19:52.498 --> 19:54.164
and it's kind of your thing.

19:54.166 --> 19:55.999
What?

19:58.537 --> 19:59.620
Huh.

19:59.622 --> 20:02.790
So you have to make a choice...

20:02.792 --> 20:04.625
between keeping her as a partner

20:04.627 --> 20:06.593
or following your heart.

20:06.595 --> 20:08.178
And I think that's a no-brainer.

20:08.180 --> 20:10.297
No. You don't understand...

20:10.299 --> 20:11.632
I understand
you've been

20:11.634 --> 20:14.768
spending eight to 12 hours
a day with this woman in a car,

20:14.770 --> 20:17.137
and at the end of the shift,
you're going out to drinks

20:17.139 --> 20:18.639
with her.
So?

20:18.641 --> 20:21.308
So? Do you know
how special that is?

20:21.310 --> 20:24.311
Instead of looking
for some space

20:24.313 --> 20:25.646
at the end of a long day,

20:25.648 --> 20:27.564
you're looking to spend
more time with her.

20:27.566 --> 20:29.149
I can tell you

20:29.151 --> 20:31.118
that if I had
that with someone

20:31.120 --> 20:33.454
I would not be
sitting here with you

20:33.456 --> 20:35.823
wondering if I should pursue it.

20:41.914 --> 20:44.465
She was executed
by your friends, Javi.

20:44.467 --> 20:46.417
She has kids!

20:46.419 --> 20:48.669
You don't understand.
I don't get

20:48.671 --> 20:50.671
how my brother,

20:50.673 --> 20:52.005
the same person who protected me

20:52.007 --> 20:53.056
from all those bullies

20:53.058 --> 20:54.508
at school,
is sitting

20:54.510 --> 20:57.010
in an interrogation room

20:57.012 --> 20:58.692
trying to convince me
he's not a crackhead!

21:00.349 --> 21:02.649
You do realize

21:02.651 --> 21:04.101
she was shot in the back
of the head, right?

21:04.103 --> 21:05.903
Javi.

21:05.905 --> 21:07.154
That could've been your sister

21:07.156 --> 21:08.856
who was shot in the back
of the head in that ambush.

21:08.858 --> 21:10.407
You said

21:10.409 --> 21:11.492
they wanted revenge, right?

21:11.494 --> 21:13.610
The coke

21:13.612 --> 21:15.696
that was taken
by the cops,

21:15.698 --> 21:17.865
it was worth $10 million.

21:19.084 --> 21:21.118
Mara Noche wanted
to get a little payback.

21:21.120 --> 21:23.003
DANNY: They wanted payback
by intercepting

21:23.005 --> 21:24.621
the DEA truck?
No.

21:24.623 --> 21:27.341
I don't know anything
about the DEA truck.

21:27.343 --> 21:28.675
They were
talking about

21:28.677 --> 21:30.010
trying to steal
the drugs back

21:30.012 --> 21:32.546
and I thought they meant from...
inside the precinct.

21:32.548 --> 21:34.097
From the cops?
From us?

21:34.099 --> 21:35.516
When were you gonna
tell us all that?

21:35.518 --> 21:36.717
After some cops got killed?

21:37.386 --> 21:38.936
JAVI:
Would you do me a favor?

21:38.938 --> 21:40.721
Stop talking to me
like I'm one of them.

21:40.723 --> 21:42.473
How do you know all of that?

21:42.475 --> 21:45.893
Three months,
I was an informant for the DEA!

21:50.199 --> 21:51.648
Yeah!

21:51.650 --> 21:53.901
What the hell are
you talking about?

21:53.903 --> 21:56.236
They said I couldn't
tell anyone.

21:56.238 --> 21:58.789
You couldn't tell me?

22:01.327 --> 22:02.960
I thought you'd be happy.

22:02.962 --> 22:04.962
“Happy”?
First time in my life

22:04.964 --> 22:07.247
I'm doing something

22:07.249 --> 22:09.299
that I think you're gonna be
proud of me for.

22:09.301 --> 22:12.386
First time in my life!

22:15.841 --> 22:19.393
Javi, what did you hear about
Mara Noche taking out the truck?

22:22.681 --> 22:26.099
DEA transports drugs
once a year.

22:26.101 --> 22:27.734
I didn't know when or where.

22:27.736 --> 22:30.821
Where the hell did Mara Noche
get this information?

22:32.942 --> 22:34.441
I heard that it came

22:34.443 --> 22:36.660
from inside the DEA.

22:45.588 --> 22:47.788
(knocking)

22:49.174 --> 22:50.457
It's open.

22:50.459 --> 22:52.593
(door opens)

22:54.797 --> 22:57.014
Evening, Commissioner.

23:00.052 --> 23:02.469
Sorry for the inconvenience,
Lieutenant.

23:02.471 --> 23:04.638
Thanks for coming out here.

23:08.143 --> 23:09.476
I was just about to...

23:09.478 --> 23:11.979
None for me, thank you.

23:14.650 --> 23:16.817
I think we got
some iced tea in here.

23:16.819 --> 23:18.986
I'm fine, sir.

23:23.993 --> 23:26.159
How are you holding up?

23:26.161 --> 23:29.196
About as well as can
be expected, I guess.

23:31.083 --> 23:33.517
I'm not supposed
to talk to you.

23:34.670 --> 23:36.587
Or me to you.

23:36.589 --> 23:39.673
But I called, you came.

23:39.675 --> 23:41.975
This is just between you and me.

23:41.977 --> 23:43.343
Yes, sir.

23:43.345 --> 23:44.678
Thank you.

23:46.015 --> 23:47.347
There... Yeah.

23:47.349 --> 23:50.684
There's something
I felt I had to know.

23:50.686 --> 23:52.402
And I can

23:52.404 --> 23:55.322
only learn it
by asking you face-to-face.

23:55.324 --> 23:56.690
Yes, sir?

23:56.692 --> 23:58.909
You're a good cop.

23:58.911 --> 24:02.112
So I'm sure you've been turning

24:02.114 --> 24:05.248
this over and over in your mind.

24:06.285 --> 24:08.535
Pretty much 24-7.

24:10.923 --> 24:15.008
Would you have done
anything differently?

24:20.049 --> 24:22.716
Yes, sir.

24:47.212 --> 24:48.068
Seems like every time

24:48.069 --> 24:49.651
I turn on the TV,
there's video surveillance

24:49.653 --> 24:51.286
of that guy getting stunned.

24:51.288 --> 24:52.638
LINDA:
Oh, I know!

24:52.640 --> 24:54.740
Everything turns
into a sideshow.

24:54.742 --> 24:57.543
That lieutenant really
got raked over the coals.

24:57.545 --> 24:58.994
Doesn't seem right.

24:58.996 --> 25:02.131
I thought we agreed not to
talk shop at Sunday dinner?

25:02.133 --> 25:05.501
Must've dreamt it.

25:05.503 --> 25:06.919
(chuckles)
We get EDPs

25:06.921 --> 25:09.004
in the hospital
all the time.

25:09.006 --> 25:10.889
They're impossible to predict.

25:10.891 --> 25:12.424
You know,
I don't know how

25:12.426 --> 25:14.593
you can make strict protocols

25:14.595 --> 25:16.728
for situations that
by their very nature

25:16.730 --> 25:18.347
are completely chaotic.

25:18.349 --> 25:20.649
Exactly right.
Wrong.

25:20.651 --> 25:22.351
There's very little
that happens

25:22.353 --> 25:24.653
in a day
that can't be anticipated.

25:24.655 --> 25:26.655
Well, in this case,
a lack of anticipation

25:26.657 --> 25:28.774
may have caused
a crime of its own.

25:28.776 --> 25:31.160
How does that work?

25:31.162 --> 25:33.662
By not securing the entire area

25:33.664 --> 25:36.114
before he ordered
Stapleton to be tasered,

25:36.116 --> 25:37.115
the lieutenant may be charged

25:37.117 --> 25:39.001
with criminally negligent
homicide.

25:39.003 --> 25:40.619
Maybe he should be.

25:40.621 --> 25:42.921
And how would you
know that, hmm?

25:42.923 --> 25:43.923
Were you there?

25:43.924 --> 25:45.207
Did you ride along
with him, what?

25:45.209 --> 25:47.125
Uh, Danny... she's...

25:47.127 --> 25:48.760
I'm just saying from
what I hear this guy

25:48.762 --> 25:50.295
McCarthy's an exceptional cop.

25:50.297 --> 25:51.463
I'm well aware.

25:51.465 --> 25:55.017
Sergeant Gormley came
to my office to inform me.

25:55.019 --> 25:57.186
I got to say

25:57.188 --> 25:58.720
I'd do the same thing for my partner.
Well, from what I hear,

25:58.722 --> 26:01.306
you want to do a lot more
than that for your partner.

26:03.277 --> 26:04.443
What? No. I did not...

26:04.445 --> 26:05.527
Danny, I didn't say anything...
I swear...

26:05.529 --> 26:06.812
It's not like
it's a big secret

26:06.814 --> 26:08.480
or anything. Everyone knows.
Yeah.

26:08.482 --> 26:11.116
This is like we're
back in fifth grade.

26:11.118 --> 26:13.068
What's wrong with
being in fifth grade?

26:13.070 --> 26:15.153
I wish you all were
back in the fifth grade

26:15.155 --> 26:17.739
when you had no idea
what was going on.

26:17.741 --> 26:20.125
Well, just for the record,
I'm not the one

26:20.127 --> 26:21.410
who goes through a partner
every year, so...

26:21.412 --> 26:23.662
Hey, I made a joke.
You got a problem?

26:23.664 --> 26:25.247
I don't have a problem. You got a problem?
I don't have

26:25.249 --> 26:26.999
a problem, but you're gonna
have a problem in a second.

26:27.001 --> 26:27.966
Oh, really?

26:27.968 --> 26:30.469
Knock it off!

26:36.143 --> 26:37.843
What's the matter, Francis?

26:37.845 --> 26:40.979
James McCarthy won't be

26:40.981 --> 26:43.015
“raked over the coals” anymore.

26:43.017 --> 26:44.349
And he won't be charged

26:44.351 --> 26:46.068
with anything.

26:46.070 --> 26:49.571
After 19 years on the job
and 12 years sober,

26:49.573 --> 26:52.074
he got behind
the wheel drunk last night

26:52.076 --> 26:54.910
and missed a curve
on the Jackie Robinson.

26:54.912 --> 26:56.528
Oh, God.

26:56.530 --> 26:58.580
He's in bad shape.

27:13.130 --> 27:15.347
Gin rummy.

27:15.349 --> 27:17.215
Again?

27:17.217 --> 27:19.184
Age before beauty.

27:19.186 --> 27:20.852
(laughs)
Another hand?

27:20.854 --> 27:22.604
Till I win.

27:22.606 --> 27:24.806
Okay.

27:25.809 --> 27:27.559
HENRY:
Maybe...

27:27.561 --> 27:29.478
we should up the ante.

27:29.480 --> 27:31.730
(Henry and Nicky chat
indistinctly in other room)

27:41.959 --> 27:43.909
You know it's not your fault.

27:43.911 --> 27:47.713
Do I?

27:47.715 --> 27:50.582
McCarthy made a bad call.

27:50.584 --> 27:52.718
And he knew it.

27:54.054 --> 27:56.972
Ah.

27:56.974 --> 27:59.641
Yeah, I talked to him.

27:59.643 --> 28:01.259
Oh?

28:03.180 --> 28:06.431
He didn't deserve the press
calling him a murderer.

28:07.768 --> 28:11.486
And he didn't deserve
to be left hanging out to dry.

28:11.488 --> 28:14.439
You did what you needed to do.

28:14.441 --> 28:17.192
But I didn't do
what I wanted to do.

28:17.194 --> 28:20.278
Tell the mayor
he was talking out of his ass.

28:21.281 --> 28:22.914
Okay, well, then you would've

28:22.916 --> 28:24.783
woken up out of a job.

28:24.785 --> 28:27.953
I hate this job.

28:29.790 --> 28:32.958
Some days you hate this job.

28:36.597 --> 28:39.097
Yeah.

28:39.099 --> 28:42.017
Couple of years ago,

28:42.019 --> 28:44.469
no way I would've listened
to the mayor

28:44.471 --> 28:46.805
or the DA's office.

28:46.807 --> 28:49.641
I would've stood by my officer.

29:01.705 --> 29:05.073
Working on a Sunday night?

29:05.075 --> 29:07.492
Trying to figure out
who's the DEA mole.

29:07.494 --> 29:09.211
Hmm.
What's your excuse?

29:09.213 --> 29:10.829
I couldn't sleep.

29:10.831 --> 29:13.298
Got a meeting
with the commissioner tomorrow.

29:13.300 --> 29:14.549
Uh-huh.

29:14.551 --> 29:16.718
Called to the
principal's office, huh?

29:16.720 --> 29:18.336
Mm-hmm.
What you do?

29:18.338 --> 29:20.305
I was partners
with Lieutenant McCarthy

29:20.307 --> 29:21.807
back in the day.

29:21.809 --> 29:22.974
Thought he was being railroaded

29:22.976 --> 29:25.227
and I told your old man that.

29:25.229 --> 29:28.180
Now, I think he's gonna
transfer me to the auto pound.

29:28.182 --> 29:31.683
Or to Staten Island.

29:31.685 --> 29:34.653
You know, you may want
to go easy there, Sarge.

29:34.655 --> 29:37.155
We got Great Kills--
best beach in the five boroughs.

29:37.157 --> 29:39.357
And the biggest landfill.

29:39.359 --> 29:41.910
You know, maybe you should
start fueling up now.

29:41.912 --> 29:43.862
The commute can get
pretty rough.

29:43.864 --> 29:45.447
Thanks.

29:45.449 --> 29:46.698
BAEZ:
Reagan?

29:46.700 --> 29:48.583
What the hell's going on?

29:48.585 --> 29:50.001
Javi's gone.

29:50.003 --> 29:52.287
What are you talking about “Javi's gone”?
He called.

29:52.289 --> 29:54.689
Just said he thinks they're onto
him and the phone went dead.

29:57.511 --> 30:00.178
(knocking on glass)

30:00.180 --> 30:01.096
Boss?

30:01.098 --> 30:02.214
Yeah?
Hey.

30:02.216 --> 30:03.432
Come in.

30:03.434 --> 30:06.518
I've been thinking about it.

30:06.520 --> 30:08.553
I did what you asked.

30:08.555 --> 30:10.555
And I have
absolutely no intention

30:10.557 --> 30:12.140
of getting involved
with Officer Janko.

30:12.142 --> 30:13.308
She's my work partner.

30:13.310 --> 30:14.726
I'd like it to remain that way.

30:14.728 --> 30:17.779
But I'm gonna be
watching you, Reagan.

30:17.781 --> 30:19.981
And if I see anything like
I saw last week,

30:19.983 --> 30:22.901
I'm not gonna separate
just the two of you,

30:22.903 --> 30:24.536
I'm gonna make sure

30:24.538 --> 30:26.071
you're not even
in the same precinct.

30:27.241 --> 30:28.457
Understood?

30:28.459 --> 30:30.992
Loud and clear, boss.

30:31.662 --> 30:33.462
Get out of here.

30:33.464 --> 30:35.330
Hey.

30:35.332 --> 30:39.167
Javi's last call hit off
a cell tower in the South Bronx.

30:39.169 --> 30:40.752
Uh-huh. You know,
there were only four people

30:40.754 --> 30:43.138
in the DEA
who knew that Javi was a C.I.

30:43.140 --> 30:44.256
Three of them agents.

30:44.258 --> 30:45.757
And we've already gone through

30:45.759 --> 30:48.426
all their communications
with a fine-tooth comb.

30:48.428 --> 30:50.061
Uh-huh, and the group secretary,

30:50.063 --> 30:52.430
who knew all the particulars
about the drug transfer.

30:52.432 --> 30:54.566
But it's not unusual
for a civilian employee

30:54.568 --> 30:56.485
to have access
to that information.

30:56.487 --> 30:59.020
No, but it is if she put up bail

30:59.022 --> 31:01.656
for a member
of Mara Noche a year ago.

31:05.779 --> 31:08.280
There's our mole.

31:08.282 --> 31:09.781
Set? Are you ready?

31:09.783 --> 31:12.000
All right, let's go.

31:13.003 --> 31:14.452
(line ringing)

31:14.454 --> 31:16.171
WOMAN:
DEA.

31:16.173 --> 31:18.089
Mattone speaking.

31:18.091 --> 31:19.091
Dolores, it's Rick.

31:19.092 --> 31:20.792
Do me a favor and
round up the team.

31:20.794 --> 31:22.711
We figured out the
location of the drugs.

31:22.713 --> 31:24.796
That's good news.
I'll get right on it.

31:24.798 --> 31:27.516
Should I give them any details?

31:27.518 --> 31:29.968
Just tell the guys we got
to work quickly on this thing.

31:29.970 --> 31:31.469
Okay. Copy that.

31:31.471 --> 31:34.189
(clicks, buttons beeping)

31:34.191 --> 31:35.974
(line ringing)

31:38.061 --> 31:39.311
Ramon, you've got
to move everything. They know.

31:39.313 --> 31:40.478
RAMON:
You sure?

31:40.480 --> 31:41.897
MATTONE:
Just get out of there.

31:41.899 --> 31:43.782
Son of a bitch!
We get an address?

31:43.784 --> 31:44.983
She called an auto body shop

31:44.985 --> 31:46.201
in the Bronx.

31:46.203 --> 31:47.763
Let's not waste
another second. Come on!

32:08.029 --> 32:09.589
Sit down, Sergeant.

32:14.932 --> 32:15.920
Sir, I just wanted to say...

32:15.944 --> 32:17.541
You know
what my job is sergeant?

32:19.706 --> 32:21.364
Do you know what my job?

32:21.899 --> 32:23.523
You're the Police Commissioner.

32:23.547 --> 32:25.290
And do you know
what that job entails?

32:27.139 --> 32:28.237
Probably not.

32:28.238 --> 32:29.659
Definitely not.

32:29.739 --> 32:31.305
I was out of line, Commissioner.

32:31.307 --> 32:32.824
I apologize.

32:32.826 --> 32:36.244
I didn't bring you down here
for an apology.

32:36.246 --> 32:38.413
If I may, sir, please,

32:38.415 --> 32:40.915
don't transfer me
to Staten Island.

32:40.917 --> 32:42.383
I live in New Hyde Park.

32:42.385 --> 32:44.469
The commute alone would kill me.

32:46.056 --> 32:49.424
I brought you here
to say thank you.

32:51.428 --> 32:53.561
Sir?

32:56.983 --> 33:00.852
Every one who comes
in this office has an agenda.

33:00.854 --> 33:03.404
Most people tell me
what I want to hear.

33:03.406 --> 33:06.324
Some people tell me
what they want me to do.

33:06.326 --> 33:08.443
What I don't have

33:08.445 --> 33:11.662
is someone with firsthand
knowledge of police work

33:11.664 --> 33:13.948
giving me the unvarnished truth.

33:13.950 --> 33:16.284
I believe, sir, that's because

33:16.286 --> 33:17.919
they don't want to piss you off.

33:17.921 --> 33:20.538
Didn't seem to deter you.

33:20.540 --> 33:23.708
Well, I'm a
thick-headed Irish mutt

33:23.710 --> 33:26.844
who barged in here without thinking
about the consequences.

33:27.881 --> 33:30.131
At least, that's what
my wife told me.

33:30.133 --> 33:32.683
She's probably right.

33:32.685 --> 33:34.185
Yeah. (laughs)

33:34.187 --> 33:36.804
She's always been
smarter than me.

33:37.974 --> 33:39.807
Mine was, too.

33:42.979 --> 33:45.313
Thank you, Commissioner.

33:47.150 --> 33:48.783
Thank you.

33:54.157 --> 33:55.990
I'm sorry about your friend.

34:00.580 --> 34:02.747
(sighs)

34:05.835 --> 34:08.052
(sighs)

34:20.516 --> 34:21.516
Go.

34:21.518 --> 34:23.851
(SWAT officers shouting)

34:27.907 --> 34:29.322
Hold it!

34:29.324 --> 34:32.025
(shouting, gunfire)

34:37.000 --> 34:38.916
I got Sanchez.

34:38.918 --> 34:41.202
(officer shouting)

34:44.456 --> 34:46.873
SWAT OFFICER:
Open those bays now!

34:53.766 --> 34:55.550
(clattering nearby)

35:11.317 --> 35:12.450
Hold it!

35:12.452 --> 35:14.285
(grunts)

35:18.741 --> 35:20.408
MAN:
Come on, move!

35:25.298 --> 35:27.381
(indistinct shouting nearby)

35:48.938 --> 35:50.104
Javi?

35:50.106 --> 35:51.106
What are you doing?

35:51.107 --> 35:52.573
It was the last time.

35:52.575 --> 35:53.608
Are you crazy?

35:53.610 --> 35:55.076
I'm trying to help you.

35:55.078 --> 35:56.744
What?
(clattering)

36:00.083 --> 36:01.249
No!

36:07.624 --> 36:11.292
BAEZ:
Javi! Javi?

36:14.547 --> 36:16.047
You're gonna be fine.
Just hang on.

36:16.049 --> 36:17.882
Just hold on, okay?
(raspy gasping)

36:17.884 --> 36:19.634
Javi, it's okay.
Just hold on.

36:19.636 --> 36:21.102
Okay? Just hold on.

36:21.104 --> 36:22.937
DANNY:
Somebody get a bus!

36:22.939 --> 36:25.306
(crying):
It's okay. It's okay, Javi.

36:25.308 --> 36:26.941
Javi, you're gonna be fine.

36:26.943 --> 36:28.859
Just hold on.
(raspy breathing)

36:28.861 --> 36:30.144
Ja-Javi.

36:30.146 --> 36:32.313
Javi?

36:32.315 --> 36:34.198
Javi?!

36:34.200 --> 36:35.816
Javi! No.

36:35.818 --> 36:37.985
Javi, no.

36:37.987 --> 36:39.236
Javi!

36:39.238 --> 36:43.074
(sobbing):
Javi, no.

36:43.076 --> 36:45.326
No, Javi, I'm sorry.

36:45.328 --> 36:48.329
Javi.

36:48.331 --> 36:49.331
Oh, my God.

36:49.332 --> 36:50.631
Javi.

36:50.633 --> 36:53.968
No. Javi.

36:53.970 --> 36:56.804
(sobbing)

36:59.058 --> 37:00.391
Javi.

37:00.393 --> 37:02.593
(sobbing)

37:21.497 --> 37:23.531
<i>First,</i> you knock.

37:24.367 --> 37:25.416
Can I come in?

37:25.418 --> 37:27.335
(laughs)

37:27.337 --> 37:29.870
Doesn't matter what I say,
you'll come in anyway.

37:29.872 --> 37:31.922
I think everyone
else already left.

37:31.924 --> 37:33.207
They're probably out
partying without us.

37:33.209 --> 37:34.625
Yeah, well,
they're going to have

37:34.627 --> 37:36.260
to party without me tonight.

37:36.262 --> 37:38.179
What? Why?

37:38.181 --> 37:41.265
I promised my grandpa
that we'd hang out tonight.

37:41.267 --> 37:43.384
Are you serious?

37:45.054 --> 37:47.304
You can hang out with
your grandpa any night.

37:48.975 --> 37:51.025
It's our anniversary.

37:51.027 --> 37:52.893
I'm officially a cop.

37:52.895 --> 37:54.362
This only happens once, Reagan.

37:54.364 --> 37:56.564
Yeah, well, I was there
for the important part.

37:56.566 --> 37:59.233
Yeah, and now you should
be there for the fun part, too.

38:01.404 --> 38:03.571
Come on.

38:09.662 --> 38:12.163
Hey, have-have one for me.

38:12.165 --> 38:13.714
Okay?

38:15.551 --> 38:17.218
I'll never forget your face

38:17.220 --> 38:20.471
when I first introduced myself
as your new partner.

38:20.473 --> 38:22.423
Uniform said NYPD,

38:22.425 --> 38:24.675
face said Eagle Scout.

38:24.677 --> 38:26.360
Yeah, well, you looked
like you were 11,

38:26.362 --> 38:28.429
going trick-or-treating
dressed up like a cop.

38:29.932 --> 38:32.266
(laughs)

38:32.268 --> 38:34.568
Well, how do I look now?

38:40.059 --> 38:41.942
Better get going,
you're gonna be late.

38:45.081 --> 38:47.114
Okay.

38:51.871 --> 38:53.921
(door closes)

38:54.924 --> 38:57.124
(glass crunching,
camera shutter clicking)

39:04.050 --> 39:06.267
Javi was playing both sides.

39:10.356 --> 39:12.690
What am I supposed
to tell my mother?

39:12.692 --> 39:14.859
Well...

39:18.614 --> 39:20.147
...you could tell her
that he died

39:20.149 --> 39:22.283
trying to save your life.

39:22.285 --> 39:24.318
'Cause he did.
Mm-hmm.

39:24.320 --> 39:25.486
(sniffles)

39:25.488 --> 39:26.488
Yeah.

39:26.489 --> 39:28.956
You want me to come with?

39:30.710 --> 39:32.626
Okay.

39:34.881 --> 39:36.664
What I said in the hospital...

39:36.666 --> 39:38.165
Forget it.

39:38.167 --> 39:40.217
I never have to worry

39:40.219 --> 39:42.169
about trusting you.

39:42.171 --> 39:44.388
And I never have to wonder

39:44.390 --> 39:46.557
if you'll have my back.

39:47.343 --> 39:49.727
Because you're the only person

39:49.729 --> 39:51.929
who's never disappointed me.

39:53.733 --> 39:55.349
(sniffles)

39:55.351 --> 39:57.518
Mm-hmm.

39:58.437 --> 40:00.654
I never will.

40:30.436 --> 40:33.220
I will not be taking
any questions today.

40:34.557 --> 40:37.057
James McCarthy is
in critical condition,

40:37.059 --> 40:40.895
with injuries to his spine,
neck and head.

40:40.897 --> 40:43.113
It will take several days

40:43.115 --> 40:45.399
to assess the long-term effects,

40:45.401 --> 40:48.502
but the prognosis is not good.

40:50.540 --> 40:53.440
On a personal note,

40:53.442 --> 40:55.626
I would like to point out here

40:55.628 --> 40:58.762
that police officers
like Lieutenant McCarthy

40:58.764 --> 41:02.833
make split-second decisions
every day,

41:02.835 --> 41:04.385
make judgment calls

41:04.387 --> 41:07.154
as part of their job.

41:07.156 --> 41:10.975
Their intention is
not to cause harm.

41:10.977 --> 41:13.928
Their intention is
to avoid harm.

41:15.431 --> 41:17.598
I believe that was
certainly the case

41:17.600 --> 41:20.017
with Lieutenant McCarthy.

41:20.019 --> 41:23.270
<i>If an officer makes</i>
<i>the wrong call,</i>

41:23.272 --> 41:28.075
<i>it not only affects</i>
<i>citizens of this city,</i>

41:28.077 --> 41:31.829
<i>it also affects</i>
<i>the officers themselves</i>

41:31.831 --> 41:34.031
<i>in ways that only someone</i>

41:34.033 --> 41:36.617
<i>who has walked in their shoes</i>

41:36.619 --> 41:39.620
<i>can fully understand.</i>

41:40.756 --> 41:43.457
Cops are held to a higher
standard of accountability

41:43.459 --> 41:45.676
than the rest of
the population,

41:45.678 --> 41:47.127
as it should be.

41:47.129 --> 41:50.798
But never forget

41:50.800 --> 41:53.200
that they are people, too:

41:53.202 --> 41:56.754
men and women subject
to the same doubts

41:56.756 --> 42:00.524
and regrets

42:00.526 --> 42:04.461
that all of us are.

42:04.463 --> 42:08.932
I'm not asking for anyone
to cut us slack.

42:08.934 --> 42:11.151
Not at all.

42:14.490 --> 42:17.825
But a little recognition

42:17.827 --> 42:20.294
for the conditions under which

42:20.296 --> 42:25.282
our men and women operate...

42:25.284 --> 42:27.501
that'd go a long way.
