00:02.134 --> 00:03.758
Come here! Come here!
Come here!

00:03.759 --> 00:04.960
You got to see this.

00:04.961 --> 00:06.994
I'm about to give
Captain Holt his gift.

00:07.029 --> 00:09.364
Oh, did he lift
his "no gift" policy?

00:09.365 --> 00:10.632
No, he didn't.

00:10.633 --> 00:12.734
But I figured out a way
to buy him something

00:12.735 --> 00:14.769
and trick him
into accepting it.

00:14.770 --> 00:17.005
- You are bad.
- I know, right?

00:17.006 --> 00:18.439
Oh, wait.
You're making fun of me.

00:18.474 --> 00:20.041
- Mm-hmm.
- Well, I don't care.

00:20.042 --> 00:21.676
He would never open a gift,
right?

00:21.677 --> 00:24.345
But what if his gift
didn't look like a gift?

00:24.380 --> 00:26.214
- He would open it?
- Exactly!

00:26.215 --> 00:28.416
I left it in a cardboard box
on his desk.

00:28.417 --> 00:30.685
There's no card,
just the words "Open now,"

00:30.686 --> 00:32.153
which I wrote with my wrong hand

00:32.188 --> 00:35.023
so he wouldn't recognize
my handwriting.

00:35.024 --> 00:36.191
- Captain.
- Santiago. Peralta.

00:36.192 --> 00:37.191
Sir.

00:37.193 --> 00:38.627
So just to recap,

00:38.628 --> 00:41.062
you left an unmarked package
on a police captain's desk

00:41.063 --> 00:43.064
on a random Monday,
with a suspicious message

00:43.065 --> 00:44.065
written on it that looked like

00:44.066 --> 00:45.333
it was scrawled
by a crazy person.

00:45.334 --> 00:47.302
- Mm-hmm.
- Bomb! There's a bomb!

00:47.303 --> 00:49.337
Everyone out!
Let's go, let's go!

00:49.338 --> 00:50.698
This is not a drill!

00:50.706 --> 00:52.908
Let's go!

00:52.909 --> 00:55.109
Great gift, babe.

Special delivery

Merry Christmas.

01:21.938 --> 01:23.438
Ah.

01:24.774 --> 01:27.309
- Heart Attack soda.
- Holy crap! I love this stuff!

01:27.310 --> 01:29.411
You know, technically,
it's just carbonated fudge.

01:29.412 --> 01:30.412
- I know.
- I thought they banned it.

01:30.413 --> 01:31.513
Not in Syria.

01:31.514 --> 01:33.582
They use it to induce labor
in goats.

01:33.583 --> 01:36.016
And your real present
arrives tomorrow.

01:36.052 --> 01:38.119
There's more?
Charles, this is too much.

01:38.120 --> 01:39.387
Nonsense!

01:39.388 --> 01:40.989
It was just a lot of time
and a lot of money.

01:40.990 --> 01:42.423
Oh.

01:44.293 --> 01:45.594
Gina!
I screwed up.

01:45.595 --> 01:46.895
I forgot to get
Charles anything.

01:46.896 --> 01:48.996
Oh, well, I always knew
he would die of sadness.

01:49.031 --> 01:50.332
I'm such a selfish jerk.

01:50.333 --> 01:51.833
I was just so focused
on Amy's gift

01:51.834 --> 01:52.834
that I completely spaced.

01:52.868 --> 01:54.536
His present to me was
so personal.

01:54.537 --> 01:56.571
All right, think.
What does Charles love?

01:56.572 --> 01:59.007
Gross food, tan pants,
"MasterChef Junior."

01:59.008 --> 02:00.408
Ooh, I could call up
one of those kids

02:00.409 --> 02:01.676
and offer them a free trip
to New York.

02:01.677 --> 02:02.701
I wouldn't do that.

02:02.712 --> 02:03.979
Right, 'cause I'm a stranger,

02:03.980 --> 02:05.180
and I shouldn't be luring them
out of state.

02:05.181 --> 02:06.881
- Good call.
- Jake, just go to Goodwin's.

02:06.882 --> 02:08.650
They're open late,
and they have everything.

02:08.651 --> 02:10.585
Right. Smart.
Please come with me.

02:10.586 --> 02:11.785
Please, I need help
picking something out.

02:11.821 --> 02:13.955
Please, Gina?

02:13.956 --> 02:15.690
I'll take a pic of Terry
in the locker room for you.

02:15.691 --> 02:18.960
No towel, with his foot up
on the bench.

02:18.961 --> 02:20.862
Towel on, still wet
from the shower.

02:20.863 --> 02:22.029
I'm in.

02:22.064 --> 02:23.164
Hey, guys.
What's up?

02:23.165 --> 02:25.165
Nothing.

02:27.370 --> 02:29.604
Diaz, are we still on
for the Polar Bear Swim tonight?

02:29.605 --> 02:31.006
It's either that or go
caroling with my family,

02:31.007 --> 02:32.274
so, yeah.

02:32.275 --> 02:33.375
I'd rather walk into
the freezing ocean.

02:33.376 --> 02:34.476
Wait, what?

02:34.477 --> 02:35.510
You guys are doing
the polar swim?

02:35.511 --> 02:36.811
Why didn't you ask me?

02:36.812 --> 02:37.902
Oh, we didn't think
you'd be interested.

02:37.913 --> 02:39.247
Yeah, you're always cold.

02:39.248 --> 02:41.583
You brought a blanket
to a Mets game in mid-July.

02:41.584 --> 02:46.036
This one thinks
July 18th is mid-July.

02:47.323 --> 02:49.858
You guys think I'm some kind
of wimp, but I'm not.

02:49.859 --> 02:52.193
I am tough, and I'm strong,

02:52.194 --> 02:54.194
and I love to splash around
in chilly water.

02:54.230 --> 02:56.064
It's not chilly, it's as cold

02:56.065 --> 02:59.033
as the waters of Cocytus,
the frozen lake of hell.

02:59.068 --> 03:00.602
I'll see you there.

03:00.603 --> 03:02.370
I can't wait to dunk my junk.

03:05.741 --> 03:07.308
Okay, gang.
I'm out.

03:07.343 --> 03:08.810
I'll be back on the 27th.

03:08.811 --> 03:10.912
I've got two days
of family time.

03:10.913 --> 03:12.713
Do not attempt to contact me.

03:12.748 --> 03:14.683
I do not want a repeat
of last year

03:14.684 --> 03:17.185
when Scully called me 50 times
on Christmas morning.

03:17.186 --> 03:19.154
No.
I called you once.

03:19.155 --> 03:20.387
My butt called the other 49.

03:20.423 --> 03:22.724
Yeah, well, my brother-in-law
Zeke was real judgy

03:22.725 --> 03:25.393
about how much
my phone was buzzing.

03:29.932 --> 03:33.301
Somebody's got
a lot of business to tend to.

03:33.302 --> 03:35.836
Who are you?
Barbara Corcoran?

03:35.871 --> 03:37.939
He didn't even make me
one of the good sharks.

03:37.940 --> 03:39.207
I'm clearly Lori.

03:39.208 --> 03:41.910
Nobody call me.

03:41.911 --> 03:43.411
Gina!

03:43.412 --> 03:46.514
It's our first annual
Boyle-Linetti Christmas.

03:46.515 --> 03:48.917
Are you excited about going
to town on Daddy's nog?

03:48.918 --> 03:51.186
Christmas is cancelled.
Charles ruined it.

03:51.187 --> 03:52.253
I'm gonna be a little late.

03:52.254 --> 03:53.588
I got to help Jake
do some shopping.

03:53.589 --> 03:55.724
Oh, last-minute gifts.

03:55.725 --> 03:57.625
Ooh, who didn't make the cut?

03:57.626 --> 04:01.196
Tell me, Jake, who's the poor
sack at the bottom of your list?

04:01.197 --> 04:04.766
Actually, Amy.

04:04.767 --> 04:08.770
- Amy? Oof! That's bad.
- Mm-hmm.

04:08.771 --> 04:10.305
Just give her
whatever you got me.

04:10.306 --> 04:11.506
Really?

04:11.507 --> 04:14.275
But then I wouldn't have
a gift for you.

04:14.276 --> 04:15.242
Would you be cool with that?

04:15.277 --> 04:16.945
No, that would eviscerate me.

04:16.946 --> 04:18.213
I'll get my coat.

04:18.214 --> 04:19.714
I'm gonna help you
find something for her.

04:19.714 --> 04:22.116
- Oh, that's not necessary.
- Buh, buh, buh, buh, buh, Jake.

04:22.151 --> 04:24.085
Also not necessary
to touch my face.

04:24.086 --> 04:26.788
It's Christmas.
A time for friendship.

04:26.789 --> 04:27.989
Damn it.
All right.

04:27.990 --> 04:29.224
I guess you'll just
have to distract him

04:29.225 --> 04:30.692
- when we get to the store.
- On it.

04:30.693 --> 04:32.227
I'll take him to housewares
and I'll ask him

04:32.228 --> 04:34.562
the difference between a skillet
and a frying pan.

04:34.563 --> 04:36.498
- That'll buy you six hours.
- Perfect.

04:36.499 --> 04:38.199
Gina, you just saved Christmas.

04:38.200 --> 04:40.535
It's what I do.

04:40.536 --> 04:42.836
Every damn year.

04:42.872 --> 04:43.912
- Good night.
- Good night.

04:45.841 --> 04:47.776
Wait! No, no, no, no, no!
Don't lock the door!

04:47.777 --> 04:49.811
I just need to buy one thing.
I'll be so fast,

04:49.812 --> 04:50.912
I won't even pay!

04:50.913 --> 04:52.046
How did that not work?

04:52.047 --> 04:53.148
Hey, there's still
people in there.

04:53.149 --> 04:54.382
They're not closed.

04:54.383 --> 04:56.718
First time at a retail store,
Oliver Twist?

04:56.719 --> 04:58.987
They lock the doors,
but if you're still inside,

04:58.988 --> 05:00.989
you get an extra 15 minutes
to finish up.

05:00.990 --> 05:02.857
Oh, perfect, so we should just
try and sneak in

05:02.858 --> 05:03.958
an entrance through the back.

05:03.959 --> 05:04.959
Boyle, you'll have to stay here.

05:04.960 --> 05:06.094
It's too dangerous.

05:06.095 --> 05:07.628
No way I let you take
that risk alone.

05:07.663 --> 05:09.330
Damn it, you are loyal.

a burro on it.

I just like the way it smelled.

05:44.366 --> 05:46.434
Um, I don't know,
maybe just subconsciously

05:46.435 --> 05:49.370
I wanted Amy
to smell more like you.

05:49.371 --> 05:52.639
Okay, little creepy, bud.
Coming on real strong.

05:52.675 --> 05:55.109

Boyle Christmas charades
can get pretty competitive

with anyone from the Nine-Nine.

07:02.811 --> 07:05.312
Right... Amy, Rosa, and Holt are
having the time of their lives

07:05.313 --> 07:07.515
splashing around

Thank you for the food

07:22.364 --> 07:23.664
This better be an emergency.

07:23.665 --> 07:25.032
There better be a gun

07:25.033 --> 07:27.601
Charles, Gina,
and I are in a hostage situation.

07:27.602 --> 07:30.204
Oh, God, I shouldn't have said
the gun thing.

07:30.205 --> 07:31.872
Terry regrets the way
he answered the phone.

07:31.873 --> 07:33.673
We're at Goodwin's.
There are multiple gunmen.

07:33.675 --> 07:34.908
They've blocked all the exits,

07:34.943 --> 07:36.209
they've taken
the security guards hostage,

07:36.244 --> 07:38.045
and we're looking
for a place to hide.

07:38.046 --> 07:39.380
It's awesome.

07:39.381 --> 07:41.482
- Awesome?
- Awesomely serious.

07:41.483 --> 07:43.384
I am not enjoying this,
no matter how much it is

07:43.385 --> 07:45.653
100% my favorite movie
come to life.

07:45.654 --> 07:47.555
The important thing
is keep Gina safe.

07:47.556 --> 07:49.389
You have a civilian with you.
I'm on the way.

07:49.424 --> 07:51.258
Cool. Oh!
Also bring a pic of yourself

07:51.259 --> 07:52.493
in a towel
coming out of the shower.

07:52.494 --> 07:54.060
<i>Can't explain why, okay?
Gotta go, bye.</i>

07:55.855 --> 07:57.031
There's a serious situation
going down

07:57.032 --> 07:58.465
they need my help with.

07:58.466 --> 08:01.969
Did one of your detectives
lose his head up his own butt?

08:01.970 --> 08:04.071
You don't even
have a job, Zeke!

08:04.072 --> 08:06.207
You know what, I'm not supposed
to be bringing this up,

08:06.208 --> 08:07.474
but I'm bringing it up!

08:07.475 --> 08:10.144
I'm sick of hearing
you got things brewing.

08:10.145 --> 08:13.714

No, you're not doing
anything like that.

08:54.956 --> 08:56.757
Someone has to asses
the situation, Boyle.

08:56.758 --> 08:58.859
Plus, we're trapped,
on Christmas,

08:58.860 --> 09:01.495
with a bunch of bad guys
who are very likely German.

09:01.496 --> 09:03.264
This is my John McClane moment.

09:03.265 --> 09:06.200
Okay.
You're gonna need a tank top.

09:06.201 --> 09:07.935
- You can have mine.
- No need.

09:07.936 --> 09:10.504
- I snagged this on the way here.
- "Baby Grrl"?

09:10.505 --> 09:12.006
Yeah, they didn't have
the best selection.

09:12.007 --> 09:13.073
I'll probably
just skip the tank.

09:13.074 --> 09:14.908
- Yeah.
- I will return.

09:14.909 --> 09:16.809
Okay.
Gina.

09:19.347 --> 09:21.115
You all right?
You look pretty cold.

09:21.116 --> 09:23.417
I'm not. I'm actually hot.

09:23.418 --> 09:26.019
Hot, and ready to get
this super fun thing over with.

09:26.054 --> 09:28.554
- First, a toast.
- Great. Let's drag this out.

09:28.590 --> 09:31.091
- To the sea.
- To the sea! Hear, hear!

09:31.092 --> 09:32.259

"In the bleak mid-winter,
frosty wind made moan,

Earth stood hard as iron,
water like a stone."

11:18.166 --> 11:19.266

- Me!

11:19.267 --> 11:20.768
Why are you calling yourself
"He"?

11:20.769 --> 11:22.302
Because that's the tagline
from the "Die Hard" poster,

11:22.303 --> 11:23.971

my high school yearbook quote.

11:23.972 --> 11:26.206
Oh, I knew I recognized it.
Next time, lead with that.

11:26.207 --> 11:28.208
Right. Sorry.
Also, there aren't 12 of them.

11:28.209 --> 11:30.177
There are seven, and they're not
terrorists, they're robbers.

11:30.178 --> 11:32.212
They brought drilling equipment
to break into the safe.

11:32.213 --> 11:35.282
Okay, so it's really seven
robbers, two cops, and one Gina.

11:35.283 --> 11:36.784
- Yes. Exactly.
- Yeah.

11:36.785 --> 11:38.285
Where's Gina?

11:38.286 --> 11:40.187
Gina?

11:40.188 --> 11:42.055
There she is.
She went for the hairspray.

11:42.056 --> 11:44.658
She is incorrigible.

11:44.659 --> 11:46.794
- Who are you? Come here.
- No!

11:46.795 --> 11:49.363
No, no, no, no.
Jake, they're taking Gina.

11:49.364 --> 11:51.205
Yeah, I know.
We're looking at the same thing.

11:53.336 --> 11:55.237
What?
They got Gina?

11:55.238 --> 11:57.038
- I told you to watch her!
- <i>I know.</i>

11:57.073 --> 11:59.741
I am so sorry, but I promise
you, we will get her back.

11:59.776 --> 12:00.943
Oh, this is bad.

12:00.944 --> 12:02.444
I got to report this
to the Vulture.

12:02.445 --> 12:03.512
He's in charge.

12:03.513 --> 12:04.780
Ugh!
The Vulture?

12:04.781 --> 12:07.348
I thought he was on his massage
tour of Southeast Asia.

12:07.384 --> 12:08.717
He's leaving tomorrow.

12:08.718 --> 12:10.284
<i>That's why he wants this
over quickly.</i>

12:10.320 --> 12:11.987
- He wants to storm the building.
- No!

12:11.988 --> 12:14.123
No, no, no.
That is a bad idea.

12:14.124 --> 12:15.657
Look, we still haven't
figured out

12:15.658 --> 12:17.426
where they're holding Gina
and the rest of the hostages.

12:17.427 --> 12:18.761
If you guys come
busting in here,

12:18.762 --> 12:20.484
things could go sideways
real fast.

12:20.497 --> 12:22.364
That's what I told him,
but then he just

12:22.365 --> 12:23.599
repeated it back to me
in a lady's voice.

12:23.600 --> 12:24.799
<i>Listen to me, Sarge.</i>

12:24.834 --> 12:26.668
Boyle and I can take these guys
out one by one

12:26.669 --> 12:27.836
and no one will get hurt.

12:27.837 --> 12:29.338
Just ask the Vulture to give me
some more time.

12:29.339 --> 12:30.572
He'll be reasonable.

12:30.573 --> 12:32.074
What am I talking about?
It's the Vulture.

12:32.075 --> 12:34.977
Tell him Tila Tequila's doing
a free show in Central Park.

12:34.978 --> 12:36.712
Then how come Tila
just posted a selfie

12:36.713 --> 12:38.747
from the Kid Rock show
in Daytona, bro?

12:38.748 --> 12:40.082
Yeah, I follow her.
You know what?

12:40.083 --> 12:41.550
I know what's going on here.

12:41.551 --> 12:44.386
Jake wants to go solo, and he's
trying to steal my thunder.

12:44.387 --> 12:46.855
He's inside and he has eyes
on the situation.

12:46.856 --> 12:49.491
Look, I'm in command here.
Look around you.

12:49.492 --> 12:51.493
I control all of this.

12:51.494 --> 12:53.896
You see that guy behind you?
That sniper?

12:53.897 --> 12:56.131
He'll shoot whoever
I tell him to.

12:56.132 --> 12:57.132
Even you.

12:57.133 --> 12:58.534
- No, I won't.
- Fine.

12:58.535 --> 13:01.437
Then, uh, he'll sit
on any rooftop I tell him to.

13:01.438 --> 13:03.739
Hey, go sit on
that rooftop, guy.

13:03.740 --> 13:05.874
Look, just give Jake
a chance.

13:05.875 --> 13:08.076
If he fails, then you can
storm the building.

13:08.077 --> 13:09.878
I'll give him a chance
to sit on his little white butt

13:09.879 --> 13:11.479
and wait for me
to come rescue him.

13:11.514 --> 13:13.415
You tell him
that I'm Liam Neeson

13:13.416 --> 13:15.850
and he's my hot,
dumb daughter.

13:15.885 --> 13:17.583
All right, we're outnumbered
and unarmed.

13:17.587 --> 13:18.987
If we're gonna get Gina back,
we need weapons.

13:18.988 --> 13:20.756
This place sells
hammers, wrenches...

13:20.757 --> 13:22.024
Do they sell plants?

13:22.025 --> 13:24.560
Because some of
that potting soil is very toxic

13:24.561 --> 13:25.841
if ingested in large quantities.

13:25.862 --> 13:28.797
So you want to feed
the bad guys a lot of soil?

13:28.798 --> 13:29.932
Force-feed 'em.

13:29.933 --> 13:30.966
Okay, that's a good option

13:30.967 --> 13:32.434

16:33.182 --> 16:35.250
I'll tell you how
John McClane would do it.

16:35.251 --> 16:36.518
The vents.

16:36.519 --> 16:39.054
Ah, blast the AC,
they get chilly,

16:39.055 --> 16:40.255
they leave to find sweaters.

16:40.256 --> 16:41.823
No, we're gonna
climb through them.

16:41.824 --> 16:45.327
Even better.
Classic use of vents.

16:45.328 --> 16:46.662
Yeah.

16:51.100 --> 16:53.568
I think we're good.

16:55.405 --> 16:57.439
I don't think
we're good anymore.

16:57.440 --> 16:59.507
<i>Who's there?
Dave, is that you?</i>

16:59.542 --> 17:01.276
What are we gonna do?
They know we're here.

17:01.277 --> 17:05.079
No, they know I'm here.

17:05.114 --> 17:07.647
Quick, hide.
Go, go, go, go.

17:09.618 --> 17:12.521
Hey, hosers.
It's me, Dave, eh?

17:12.521 --> 17:14.288
Didn't work.

17:16.122 --> 17:17.589
Jake.
Jake! Jake!

17:17.589 --> 17:19.424
- Ah!
- Are you okay?

17:19.425 --> 17:20.659
Oh, my head hurts.

17:20.693 --> 17:24.162
Probably from being conked
on it.

17:24.163 --> 17:26.998
- How are you?
- I'm tied up. I'm scared.

17:26.999 --> 17:29.968
This guy hasn't stopped farting
for the last hour.

17:29.969 --> 17:32.037
I keep telling you,
it's not me.

17:32.038 --> 17:35.440
Ramon, do you really want
your last words to be a lie?

17:35.441 --> 17:37.576
Those aren't gonna be
your last words, Ramon, all right?

17:37.577 --> 17:39.177
We're all gonna be fine.

17:39.178 --> 17:40.245
They're gonna drill
into the safe,

17:40.246 --> 17:41.445
take the money, and then go.

17:41.480 --> 17:43.014
They don't need to drill
into the safe.

17:43.015 --> 17:44.683
They had my ID.
They already have all the cash.

17:44.684 --> 17:46.117
What?

17:46.118 --> 17:48.353
Then why'd they bring
all that heavy-duty equipment?

17:48.354 --> 17:51.156
So you're a cop.

17:51.157 --> 17:53.391
- Ah.
- I hate cops.

17:53.392 --> 17:55.493
- They gave me this.
- Nice!

17:55.494 --> 17:58.596
Finally, a good bad guy.
This dude gets it.

17:58.631 --> 17:59.731
Now I'm gonna kill you.

17:59.732 --> 18:01.066
Okay, you took it
a little too far.

18:01.067 --> 18:02.267
Maybe scale it back a skosh.

18:02.268 --> 18:04.769
<i>All set down here.</i>

18:04.770 --> 18:06.571
Okay, start loading out.

18:06.572 --> 18:09.074
I just have one piece
of business to take care of.

18:09.075 --> 18:12.611
You know, killing a man
is not as easy as it sounds.

18:12.612 --> 18:13.877
I've killed ten men.

18:13.913 --> 18:15.380
And that's such a nice,
round number.

18:15.381 --> 18:16.781
Wouldn't you agree?
I mean, imagine.

18:16.782 --> 18:20.952
"I've killed 11 people."
It just sounds so cumbersome.

18:23.956 --> 18:25.589
Ooh!

18:25.625 --> 18:28.025
Yippie kayak, other buckets!

18:28.060 --> 18:29.794
Boyle!
You did it!

18:29.795 --> 18:31.896
And you completely botched
the catchphrase.

18:31.897 --> 18:35.133
- I'm pretty sure it was right.
- No, but you did great.

18:35.134 --> 18:37.668
Ahh.

18:37.703 --> 18:38.870
All right.

18:38.871 --> 18:40.038
Look, we have to stop
the other robbers.

18:40.039 --> 18:41.338
They're escaping with the merch.

18:41.374 --> 18:42.507
How?

18:42.508 --> 18:44.175
Terry's got the place
surrounded.

18:44.176 --> 18:46.211
The drill.
It's not for the safe.

18:46.212 --> 18:47.746
They're using it
to tunnel out of here.

18:47.747 --> 18:49.080
And those farts
Gina kept smelling?

18:49.081 --> 18:51.883
- Uh-huh. They were Ramon.
- No, it was sewage.

18:51.884 --> 18:53.351
And Ramon.

18:53.352 --> 18:55.754
We have to tell Terry they're
escaping through the sewers.

18:55.755 --> 18:57.354
What's a brother got to do
to get a wet wipe?

18:57.390 --> 18:58.455
Don't say that.

18:58.491 --> 19:00.892

19:00.893 --> 19:02.994
- Merry Christmas.

19:02.995 --> 19:04.194
I'm starving.

19:04.230 --> 19:05.863
"I'm starving"?
We had a thing going!

19:09.635 --> 19:13.371
Jake!
Oh, I'm so glad you're okay.

19:13.372 --> 19:14.706
Wow, you were really worried
about me?

19:14.707 --> 19:16.608
Mm-hmm, also your face
is so warm,

19:16.609 --> 19:18.275
and I think I have hypothermia.

19:21.080 --> 19:23.148
Sergeant, we need to talk.

19:23.149 --> 19:25.650
I'm not in trouble for what
I did to the Vulture, am I?

19:25.651 --> 19:27.661
You think people will believe
he threw himself in the garbage?

19:27.687 --> 19:28.853
No.

19:28.854 --> 19:30.588
But this was
a high-pressure situation,

19:30.589 --> 19:32.057
and you rose to the occasion.

19:32.058 --> 19:33.591
You may have
saved lives tonight.

19:33.592 --> 19:34.893
The squad is my family,

19:34.894 --> 19:36.861
and I'll always protect
my family.

19:36.862 --> 19:37.962
Except for Zeke.

19:37.963 --> 19:39.731
That deadbeat giant
can fend for himself.

19:39.732 --> 19:42.266
There's a Lieutenant's exam
coming up,

19:42.301 --> 19:43.768
and I think you should take it.

19:43.769 --> 19:45.721
It's the next step
to becoming a Captain.

19:45.738 --> 19:48.098
I didn't do anything.
It was all Jake and Charles.

19:48.107 --> 19:51.109
Mm, spoken like
a true Captain.

19:51.110 --> 19:52.176
Also, you are in trouble.

19:52.211 --> 19:53.677
You're suspended one week.

19:53.713 --> 19:56.648
But you've got a bright future.

19:56.649 --> 19:58.950
But I'll need
your badge and gun.

19:58.951 --> 20:00.351
Hey, buddy.

20:00.352 --> 20:02.253
I couldn't find the cologne
you wanted to give Amy,

20:02.254 --> 20:05.056
but I did get
a Canyon Stank gift set.

20:05.057 --> 20:08.193
It's all three stanks,
plus the body spray.

20:08.194 --> 20:11.528
- Oh, wow. Thanks, Charles.
- Yeah.

20:11.564 --> 20:14.699
Look, I didn't forget
Amy's gift.

20:14.700 --> 20:16.868
I forgot yours.

20:16.869 --> 20:18.502
The Canyon Stank was for you.

20:18.537 --> 20:21.473
What?
Why didn't you just tell me?

20:21.474 --> 20:22.941
Oh, because it would have
crushed my heart

20:22.942 --> 20:24.042
and ruined our friendship.

20:24.043 --> 20:25.110
Good call.

20:25.111 --> 20:27.545
Look, it sucks,
and I was selfish.

20:27.546 --> 20:28.713
I should have gotten you
something better.

20:28.714 --> 20:29.748
You did.

20:29.749 --> 20:31.916
You surrendered yourself
to keep me safe.

20:31.917 --> 20:35.053
Not only that, you sacrificed
your John McClane moment.

20:35.054 --> 20:37.621
It should have been you saying,
"Yippie kayak, other buckets!"

20:37.656 --> 20:39.758
Ah, I know you have
the moral high ground right now,

20:39.759 --> 20:40.825
but it still makes me so angry.

20:40.826 --> 20:41.860
Eh.

20:41.861 --> 20:44.596
Anyways,
Merry Christmas, buddy.

20:44.597 --> 20:45.764
