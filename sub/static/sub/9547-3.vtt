00:27.103 --> 00:28.453
Anybody! Hello!

00:29.452 --> 00:30.516
It's very important.

00:31.022 --> 00:32.470
It's a matter of life or death.

00:34.259 --> 00:36.243
Somebody please talk to me.

Please, somebody.

01:03.516 --> 01:04.949
Did you follow me here?

01:06.590 --> 01:07.590
Okay, I'm sorry.

01:08.351 --> 01:10.785
I'm sorry. Here. You can take it.
Take it. It's fine.

01:12.293 --> 01:13.310
What is that?

01:15.141 --> 01:16.141
No!

01:34.587 --> 01:35.670
Help! Please!

01:36.638 --> 01:40.929
Somebody! Help me! 
Somebody please!

01:51.502 --> 01:52.769

You get those barricades up?

03:38.596 --> 03:39.663
Yes, sir.

03:40.719 --> 03:42.928
Dr. G is guesstimating around

03:43.750 --> 03:47.712
1:00 a. m. at the latest.
Probably midnight. This a bad time?

03:47.955 --> 03:50.770
It's this MagnaPod. The thing's
brand-new and it keeps getting stuck.

03:51.128 --> 03:54.340
I can get to the menu, but every
time I press play, it just goes...

03:54.913 --> 03:57.517
I'm gonna put it away now.
We've got work to do.

04:00.746 --> 04:02.429
And what happened to your gun?

04:02.933 --> 04:04.196
Right here, back pocket.

04:04.994 --> 04:07.166
Well, I use my gun,
what, maybe once a year.

04:08.001 --> 04:09.451
Use this all the time.

04:11.591 --> 04:13.191
I bet I can guess what you're thinking.

04:13.274 --> 04:14.417
I bet you can't.

04:25.186 --> 04:26.186
Natalie!

04:27.394 --> 04:28.499
Thank you for coming.

04:30.394 --> 04:31.394
Is he okay?

04:31.514 --> 04:33.408
Yeah. Uh, he doesn't like the beach.

04:33.531 --> 04:34.598
What's he doing?

04:34.712 --> 04:36.228
Putting on his sand shoes.

04:36.321 --> 04:37.373
What are sand shoes?

04:37.566 --> 04:38.566
I don't know.

04:38.923 --> 04:41.994
Look, we've got a little problem here.
This is a clothing optional beach.

04:42.209 --> 04:43.809
- Clothing optional.
- Yeah.

04:44.120 --> 04:45.120
Oh.

04:45.242 --> 04:46.442
Oh.

04:47.223 --> 04:48.384
Yeah. So what do you think?

04:48.433 --> 04:51.323
I just want him to look around a little
bit, see if we missed something.

04:51.393 --> 04:52.526
It'll just take a minute.

04:52.607 --> 04:53.712
Oh my God, I see one.

04:53.978 --> 04:55.399
Oh God, they're everywhere.

04:55.849 --> 04:59.473
Oh no, there's another one.
I gotta take him home this is too risky.

04:59.531 --> 05:00.840
It's too late.

05:00.981 --> 05:03.665
Here he comes. We can do this.
Let's just distract him. Monk!

05:03.762 --> 05:04.962
Hey.

05:06.058 --> 05:10.758
There should be a law against
murdering people on a beach.

05:11.871 --> 05:12.938
Who was she?

05:12.972 --> 05:15.370
Actually, we don't
really have that much.

05:15.443 --> 05:20.564
Her name was Vickie Deline. 23. Lived in
Mission Hill. And she worked in a bar.

05:21.121 --> 05:22.201
What was she doing here?

05:22.268 --> 05:25.565
Well, don't know. She parked her car
up top, left her keys in the ignition.

05:26.115 --> 05:29.687
Up the hill? Why... why didn't she park
down here on the access road?

05:30.062 --> 05:32.078
- Any footprints?
- No. Uh,

05:32.137 --> 05:35.268
it rained this morning.
But body's over here.

05:35.768 --> 05:37.393
Oh, hey, like those shoes.

05:37.657 --> 05:38.657
Yeah.

05:38.718 --> 05:40.232
These are my sand shoes.

05:40.308 --> 05:41.499
Nice.

05:42.307 --> 05:43.443
Oh, look at the sand!

05:44.003 --> 05:45.086
Never seen...

05:45.171 --> 05:46.367
sand quite that color.

05:46.456 --> 05:48.851
Mr. Monk, what would
you call that color?

05:49.688 --> 05:50.871
I don't know. Sandy.

05:52.634 --> 05:54.034
Oh, look. A sand dollar.

05:54.793 --> 05:55.943
No, just a shell.

05:56.378 --> 05:57.378
Here she is.

05:57.688 --> 05:58.688
Here we go.

06:05.141 --> 06:06.174
What are you doing?

06:06.224 --> 06:07.974
I just missed her. Natalie.

06:10.870 --> 06:13.347
There's a smaller cut,
before a finger.

06:14.445 --> 06:17.378
- I guess Dr. G missed that.
- It's like a paper cut.

06:17.511 --> 06:19.661
Oh yeah, those hurt like the dickens.

06:20.279 --> 06:21.775
What about all the stab wounds?

06:21.789 --> 06:23.302
Yeah, they probably hurt too.

06:23.522 --> 06:24.837
There's still sand in it.

06:24.894 --> 06:25.894
It's fresh.

06:26.643 --> 06:29.065
Did you find anything nearby?

06:29.115 --> 06:30.382
Any papers or an envelope?

06:30.442 --> 06:31.575
Not yet.

06:32.136 --> 06:33.545
Well, she was holding something.

06:33.956 --> 06:35.889
Maybe that's what the killer was after.

06:36.690 --> 06:38.523
- She's missing a fingernail.
- Yeah.

06:38.623 --> 06:40.593
Yeah, we got that. Officer!

06:41.306 --> 06:42.487
You got that fingernail?

06:43.800 --> 06:45.700
We found it on that porch over there.

06:46.347 --> 06:48.539
- Who lives there?
- His name is Chance Singer.

06:48.795 --> 06:50.110
We haven't found him yet.

06:50.584 --> 06:52.784
Officer, XYZ.

06:55.116 --> 06:56.283
XYZ?

06:56.424 --> 06:57.833
Examine Your Zipper.

06:58.056 --> 07:01.273
- I get it. XYZ
- It must be him now.

07:06.695 --> 07:07.828
Mr. Singer?

07:10.099 --> 07:12.799
I'm Captain Leland Stottlemeyer, SFPD.

07:13.202 --> 07:15.594
There was a homicide last night.
A woman was murdered.

07:16.066 --> 07:19.985
Oh, wow. No. All that negative energy.

07:20.057 --> 07:22.059
It's the last thing the world needs.
Am I right?

07:22.115 --> 07:23.808
Do you know a girl named Vickie Deline?

07:24.004 --> 07:25.598
I know a couple of Vickies.

07:25.658 --> 07:27.191
I'm not so into last names though.

07:27.241 --> 07:29.174
Sir, would you mind
putting your shirt on?

07:29.444 --> 07:30.611
May I ask why?

07:30.915 --> 07:31.915
It would just...

07:32.041 --> 07:33.408
it would mean a lot to me.

07:33.817 --> 07:37.413
we found a broken fingernail belonging
to the victim on your front porch.

07:37.467 --> 07:39.428
Where were you last night
around midnight?

07:39.505 --> 07:42.386
- I was in jail. I just got out.
- That'll be easy enough to check.

07:42.459 --> 07:44.140
Sir, about that shirt...

07:45.018 --> 07:46.425
I'm gonna have to insist.

07:48.783 --> 07:51.770
All right. Fine. Whatever.

07:52.773 --> 07:55.373
Well, had one cause
I had to go to prison.

07:56.856 --> 08:00.279
- There we are.
- Now I'm one of you. Are you happy?

08:05.361 --> 08:06.661
Take it you're a nudist.

08:06.811 --> 08:08.144
I prefer naturist.

08:08.417 --> 08:10.563
You know, social nudity
has been around for hundreds

08:10.669 --> 08:13.492
- of years, gentlemen. Get used to it.
- XYZ!

08:13.571 --> 08:16.204
There's absolutely no biological
necessity for clothing.

08:16.254 --> 08:18.654
It's a construct.
It's a man-made artifice.

08:19.087 --> 08:20.720
XYZ. XYZ. XYZ.

08:20.894 --> 08:23.900
- Sorry I don't know what that means.
- Examine your zipper.

08:24.392 --> 08:26.444
Maybe you should examine
your attitude.

08:26.701 --> 08:28.640
Sir, do you mind taking a look

08:28.759 --> 08:30.855
and see if you recognize her?

08:30.898 --> 08:34.419
You know, when I first pulled up,
I thought Peter Magneri sent you.

08:34.466 --> 08:35.515
Peter Magneri?

08:35.679 --> 08:38.714
- Magneri Computers Peter Magneri?
- Yeah, he lives up there.

08:39.554 --> 08:41.239
He's been hassling me for years.

08:46.390 --> 08:47.990
That guy owes me 200 bucks.

08:49.127 --> 08:51.263
Mr. Monk, what are you doing?
You'll go blind.

08:51.316 --> 08:53.299
I know, But when?

08:58.511 --> 09:03.255
Mr. Magneri I just need you to look
at one photograph for our investigation.

09:03.531 --> 09:08.500
I appreciate your seeing us.
I understand your time is valuable.

09:08.783 --> 09:13.794
Actually, a reporter worked it out.
I'm worth $300,025 a minute.

09:13.825 --> 09:15.275
Well, then we'll make it quick.

09:15.575 --> 09:17.603
- Do you recognize this girl?
- Never seen her.

09:17.653 --> 09:19.834
- You didn't even look at her.
- Where's my coffee?

09:19.900 --> 09:22.321
You've already had four cups, sir.
And your wife said...

09:22.371 --> 09:24.055
- Do I need a doctor's note?
- No, sir.

09:24.105 --> 09:27.625
I got a clean bill of health from
St. Andrews less than three weeks ago.

09:27.684 --> 09:31.480
They checked me over, head-to-toe.
MRIs, X-rays, blood tests.

09:31.563 --> 09:33.734
Do you know what, I'm going
to bury the lot of you.

09:33.735 --> 09:35.231
Coffee, coffee, coffee now.

09:35.281 --> 09:38.208
She was murdered
last night on your beach.

09:38.258 --> 09:39.374
Oh, not my beach.

09:39.664 --> 09:41.579
It should be my beach,
but it's not my beach.

09:41.654 --> 09:43.204
Don't even get me started on that.

09:43.768 --> 09:45.306
I didn't actually pay for this, did I?

09:45.356 --> 09:48.273
No, sir, that's a thank-you note
from the children at Lincoln Elementary.

09:48.306 --> 09:49.460
You donated some computers.

09:49.495 --> 09:51.956
The zoning commission meets on
Wednesdays. You want to come?

09:51.970 --> 09:54.009
Sir, where were you
last night about midnight?

09:54.042 --> 09:56.459
I was here. I'm always here.
I was working late.

09:56.526 --> 09:58.587
Did you see anyone or hear anything?

09:58.663 --> 10:01.100
As a matter of fact,
a woman tried to get in last night.

10:01.157 --> 10:03.090
- She kept on ringing the buzzer.
- Who was she?

10:03.091 --> 10:04.134
How should I know?

10:04.493 --> 10:05.510
Did she say anything?

10:05.560 --> 10:07.692
Yes. Something about
a matter of life and death.

10:08.192 --> 10:10.544
- And you didn't let her in.
- What, are you crazy?

10:10.827 --> 10:12.477
Everybody wants a piece of me.

10:12.527 --> 10:14.873
Everybody's problem's
a matter of life and death.

10:15.105 --> 10:18.710
Yeah, I know. Happens to us all the
time. Everybody wants something.

10:18.807 --> 10:21.473
Listen, while we are here,
when I press play,

10:21.549 --> 10:23.406
why does it keep sending
me back to the menu?

10:23.443 --> 10:25.534
I have no idea. Call customer service.

10:25.567 --> 10:26.666
No, no, no. Ha ha.

10:26.684 --> 10:29.717
They kept me on hold for an hour and a
half. Look, my warranty just expired.

10:29.745 --> 10:31.997
- If you could take a quick look at it..
- Lieutenant!

10:32.556 --> 10:34.544
Holster your MP3. That's an order.

10:37.674 --> 10:39.265
Is there a security camera by the gate?

10:39.299 --> 10:41.699
- Yeah, but it's broken.
- That's a big surprise.

10:41.765 --> 10:44.331
Look at him, out there in public.

10:44.973 --> 10:46.973
Mr. Monk, it's a nude beach!

10:47.881 --> 10:49.747
It's repugnant. That's the word.

10:50.307 --> 10:51.917
- Repugnant.
- Degenerate.

10:51.950 --> 10:52.951
That's the other word.

10:53.293 --> 10:54.293
Degenerate!

10:54.389 --> 10:56.205
Don't you think
that's a little bit harsh?

10:57.204 --> 10:58.287
Being polite.

10:58.539 --> 10:59.689
Where was he last night?

10:59.783 --> 11:00.783
Exactly.

11:00.844 --> 11:02.465
We already spoke to Mr. Singer.

11:02.498 --> 11:03.998
Yeah, well, speak to him again.

11:04.115 --> 11:06.915
Oh, he likes to pretend
he's all peaceful and new age-y,

11:06.960 --> 11:09.065
but believe you me, there's a dark side.

11:09.144 --> 11:10.144
I believe it.

11:10.454 --> 11:12.141
I can tell. Even from here.

11:12.185 --> 11:15.235
He threatened me once
at a zoning meeting.

11:15.758 --> 11:17.073
Hit me with a microphone.

11:17.346 --> 11:18.346
He's a nudist!

11:18.429 --> 11:19.529
That's what they do.

11:19.813 --> 11:21.533
They... they hit people
with microphones.

11:22.184 --> 11:23.184
Captain.

11:29.690 --> 11:30.824
He's the guy.

11:30.921 --> 11:32.560
He says he was here all night.

11:32.625 --> 11:34.775
- We're going to talk to his staff.
- Not him.

11:35.165 --> 11:36.432
Thenudist.

11:36.475 --> 11:37.475
Singer?

11:38.405 --> 11:39.788
I already called, Monk.

11:40.105 --> 11:42.446
His alibi checks out.
He was in a lockup all night.

11:42.496 --> 11:44.388
I don't know how he did it...

11:45.489 --> 11:46.614
but he's the guy.

11:51.356 --> 11:52.643
I still can't believe it.

11:53.674 --> 11:55.040
She was more than my roommate.

11:55.113 --> 11:56.380
She was my best friend.

11:56.686 --> 11:57.836
I'm so sorry.

11:58.024 --> 11:59.544
How long did you know her?

12:00.322 --> 12:01.372
Three years.

12:01.915 --> 12:03.615
We met at a bar downtown.

12:04.055 --> 12:07.524
She was waitressing, and I was working
across the street at the hospital.

12:08.219 --> 12:09.819
I used to be a lab technician.

12:10.192 --> 12:11.892
- Used to be?
- I quit...

12:12.637 --> 12:15.387
about two weeks ago to play the market.

12:15.849 --> 12:16.849
Day trader?

12:16.981 --> 12:18.997
- Good for you.
- Well, we'll see.

12:19.654 --> 12:21.714
- Ask me again in a few months.
- Sand.

12:22.538 --> 12:23.888
That must be Vickie.

12:24.094 --> 12:25.563
She'd been going to the beach a lot.

12:25.646 --> 12:28.440
- To meeting a nudist?
- A nudist?

12:28.828 --> 12:30.975
Was she seeing anyone in particular?

12:31.382 --> 12:33.199
Uh, I think so.

12:33.680 --> 12:35.980
- She'd been hinting about a guy...
- Was he a nudist?

12:36.417 --> 12:38.600
Let me put it another way.
Was he always naked?

12:38.862 --> 12:40.620
Mr. Monk, you're not letting her talk.

12:41.188 --> 12:42.354
I don't know.

12:42.807 --> 12:44.972
I think she might have been
meeting him last night.

12:44.998 --> 12:47.227
- That's him. I knew it.
- You don't know his name.

12:47.260 --> 12:49.391
- We all know his name.
- Can I talk to you?

12:50.356 --> 12:51.523
Excuse us. Come here.

12:51.566 --> 12:54.062
What are we doing here?
We should be getting a search warrant.

12:54.096 --> 12:56.409
We gotta get back to the beach.
Get into his trailer.

12:56.426 --> 12:57.492
Would you relax?

12:57.719 --> 12:59.278
I have never seen you like this.

13:00.152 --> 13:02.135
We're wasting our time. It's the nudist.

13:02.201 --> 13:04.286
- We both know it.
- I don't know that, Monk.

13:05.768 --> 13:09.650
Look, maybe you're right. You usually
are. But I have to do my job here.

13:10.334 --> 13:13.000
I need to dot every I
and cross all the Ts.

13:13.735 --> 13:14.969
You can appreciate that.

13:15.687 --> 13:17.538
You don't want any uncrossed Ts, do you?

13:17.605 --> 13:18.605
Just sticking up.

13:18.682 --> 13:20.848
- Some crossed. Some of 'em not crossed.
- Hello.

13:20.974 --> 13:23.357
With different angles.
That would be anarchy,wouldn't it?

13:23.600 --> 13:26.428
- Yes.
- And we don't want that, do we?

13:26.558 --> 13:30.129
No. Sweetheart, I can't leave just now.
Mr. Monk isn't feeling very well.

13:30.179 --> 13:31.729
He saw a naked man today.

13:33.289 --> 13:34.552
I knew you'd understand.

13:34.712 --> 13:36.112
So I'll be there at 4:30.

13:37.345 --> 13:38.976
I just need to get the address.

13:39.878 --> 13:42.495
- Scuse me. May I use this?
- Sure.

13:42.771 --> 13:43.771
Go ahead, sweetie.

13:44.264 --> 13:45.331
CDs, huh?

13:46.199 --> 13:47.399
I've gone digital.

13:48.133 --> 13:49.200
60 Gigs.

13:49.281 --> 13:50.931
Over 5,000 songs in here.

13:51.834 --> 13:54.961
- Of course, I can't play any of them.
- Okay. Where were we?

13:54.989 --> 13:58.553
- We were talking about the nudist.
- No we weren't. Randy check your notes.

13:58.607 --> 14:00.879
- Where were we?
- Uh, right.

14:01.468 --> 14:03.402
Um, did, uh, Vickie have any other...

14:04.659 --> 14:06.959
There it is. What?

14:07.969 --> 14:09.241
No, no, no. No, no, no.

14:14.291 --> 14:15.291
Scuse me.

14:22.493 --> 14:24.809
Okay. Did Vickie have
any other boyfriends

14:24.846 --> 14:26.046
that we need to know about?

14:54.999 --> 14:57.260
Wait, Mr. Monk.
I don't think we should do this.

14:57.335 --> 14:58.435
You got a better idea?

14:58.466 --> 14:59.666
Yes. Not doing it.

15:10.257 --> 15:11.457
Door was open.

15:12.206 --> 15:13.506
Must've been the wind.

15:13.602 --> 15:16.518
Don't we need a search warrant?
What about the guy's rights?

15:17.484 --> 15:20.668
All your little rules.
All your little laws.

15:21.476 --> 15:23.086
They don't apply down here.

15:24.619 --> 15:26.336
It's nudie town.

15:39.390 --> 15:43.273
It's a petition to keep
beach clothing optional.

15:44.514 --> 15:47.180
Oh yeah. That could give somebody
a nasty paper cut.

15:50.854 --> 15:52.171
There's a knife missing.

15:52.784 --> 15:54.936
It's right here.
He was making a sandwich.

15:55.971 --> 15:57.204
Oh, this guy's good.

15:58.230 --> 15:59.598
He's one step ahead of us.

16:09.030 --> 16:10.047
Hello.

16:10.082 --> 16:12.265
- What? What? What?
- Skinless chicken.

16:13.262 --> 16:14.829
Seedless grapes.

16:14.890 --> 16:17.221
- You see how it's all fitting together?
- No.

16:17.366 --> 16:19.216
Look sugar in the raw.

16:19.275 --> 16:20.795
Mr. Monk, you're scaring me.

16:20.880 --> 16:22.458
I've never seen you
like this.

16:22.629 --> 16:25.124
It's like you want
this man to be guilty.

16:26.965 --> 16:29.733
Mr. Monk, there's something
that I have to tell you.

16:30.315 --> 16:32.765
When I was an exchange student
in Greece...

16:32.977 --> 16:34.560
Oh. Someone's coming!

16:35.339 --> 16:36.873
The nudists. It's the nudists.

16:36.989 --> 16:38.545
The nudists are back. The closet!

16:38.603 --> 16:40.196
No! There's no room!

16:40.852 --> 16:42.128
Oh yeah. No clothes.

16:45.464 --> 16:46.764
Okay, I'll get the light here.

16:48.198 --> 16:49.514
Do you have anything to drink?

16:49.586 --> 16:52.366
Oh yeah, sure, in the fridge.
Anything you want. The water's potable.

16:52.396 --> 16:53.413
Oh, cool.

16:53.463 --> 16:55.679
So who was she, the girl who was killed?

16:55.779 --> 16:57.706
You know, I just know
what I read in the paper.

16:57.739 --> 16:59.606
She was a waitress from Mission Hill.

16:59.656 --> 17:02.575
Right, and they think
that you're actually involved

17:02.625 --> 17:04.444
- in this somehow.
- I'm not surprised.

17:04.499 --> 17:07.230
They're always looking for a reason
to kick me out of here.

17:07.277 --> 17:08.296
What was she doing?

17:08.803 --> 17:09.909
You know, I don't know.

17:09.959 --> 17:11.553
I get kids coming down here every night.

17:11.564 --> 17:14.287
Maybe she was looking to score some
drugs or meet a dealer.

17:14.382 --> 17:15.786
Can we talk about something else?

17:15.862 --> 17:17.791
All this murder talk's really
bringing me down.

17:17.906 --> 17:19.643
- It's sad.
- All right. To business.

17:19.692 --> 17:21.261
Okay. So Jenny, can you take some notes?

17:21.310 --> 17:22.415
- Sure.
- Okay, yeah.

17:22.617 --> 17:24.685
- Anybody got a pen?
- Do I have a pen?

17:24.914 --> 17:27.664
- Definitely not.
- Whoops.

17:27.752 --> 17:30.070
Scuse me.Sorry. I got one!

17:31.886 --> 17:34.367
- Oh, cool. Whoops.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

17:35.588 --> 17:36.892
It rolled down that way.

17:36.987 --> 17:38.598
- Under here?
- Yeah, right behind you.

17:38.976 --> 17:41.248
I think you just
kicked it behind you, man.

17:41.249 --> 17:44.032
I don't see it.
Maybe under the fridge under the fridge?

17:45.141 --> 17:47.643
- Check under there.
- Where?

17:47.998 --> 17:50.309
I'm getting tired of this.
Just get a new pen

17:50.378 --> 17:52.872
- If I get lower,
- I can see more.

17:53.339 --> 17:55.248
- I don't.
- That's weird.

17:55.380 --> 17:57.988
- Right by there. Bend over.
- This is getting tiring.

17:59.731 --> 18:02.165
Wait a second. Wait a second.
Isn't that it right there?

18:04.254 --> 18:05.613
Move your foot. Move your foot.

18:06.321 --> 18:08.205
- The other foot. No, Chance's foot.
- Where?

18:08.286 --> 18:09.886
There it is. I see it. Wait a sec there.

18:09.933 --> 18:12.067
Yeah, it's right there.
It's right under there.

18:12.864 --> 18:14.097
We're good to go.

18:14.164 --> 18:15.243
- Very good.
- Nice grasp.

18:15.277 --> 18:18.709
Sorry about that, guys.
Slid all the way down there.

18:19.275 --> 18:23.759
- That's crazy.
- Okay, so item number one.

18:23.849 --> 18:26.216
Zoning board meets tomorrow.

18:26.307 --> 18:30.361
Marin County Court House. 10:00 am.
This is it, people. The Super Bowl.

18:30.609 --> 18:32.109
What's the use?

18:32.172 --> 18:34.243
Peter Magneri's
gonna buy their votes anyway.

18:34.277 --> 18:37.622
Hey, no negative thoughts. Come on.
We have to share.

18:37.648 --> 18:39.040
It's our beach.

18:39.381 --> 18:41.911
- Nobody can take it from us, right?
- No.

18:41.981 --> 18:44.680
Okay, so we have to rember the petion
and copies of the survey.

18:44.714 --> 18:46.630
And also here's the thing...

18:47.854 --> 18:48.937
we have to go textile.

18:49.349 --> 18:52.216
- It's just for one day
- and we don't want

18:52.768 --> 18:54.951
to do anything to offend these people.

18:55.071 --> 18:56.278
Plus, I think it's illegal.

18:56.344 --> 19:00.344
Forget it. I don't have
anything to wear. Literally.

19:00.769 --> 19:01.769
Huh.

19:01.786 --> 19:04.352
You know, I have an old
suit in the closet. You wanna try it on?

19:04.386 --> 19:06.452
- You don't want...
- Suit?

19:07.378 --> 19:09.277
What about the principle
of the matter?

19:09.354 --> 19:11.697
I'm with you, but still,
I don't give a rest of it.

19:14.853 --> 19:16.100
Just take my hand!

19:20.038 --> 19:22.110
Mr. Monk, where are you going?

19:22.206 --> 19:23.758
It doesn't matter. Just keep running!

19:23.792 --> 19:27.061
- My friends are going to worry about me
- What friends are you talking about?

19:29.644 --> 19:30.827
Let go of my hand now.

19:32.354 --> 19:33.454
Where's your warrant?

19:33.491 --> 19:34.725
Where are your trousers?

19:34.758 --> 19:37.620
Why don't you just leave us alone?
We're just trying to live our lives.

19:37.641 --> 19:39.071
So was Vickie Deline.

19:39.101 --> 19:42.243
I know you were seeing her, Singer.
Her roommate told me.

19:42.260 --> 19:43.769
- Her roommate.
- What happened?

19:44.235 --> 19:46.535
She didn't want to join
your little cult?

19:46.989 --> 19:49.054
She tried to run. You grabbed the knife.

19:49.125 --> 19:52.201
- I did not know the girl. Liar!
- I never met her!

19:52.229 --> 19:54.213
- Will you get out of my face, please?
- No, no.

19:54.246 --> 19:58.279
No, I know that trick. I step back,
I see the whole schmegge.

19:58.346 --> 20:00.741
- Mr. Monk, are you okay?
- Your friend here is psychotic!

20:00.788 --> 20:02.892
We both know you did this. Pervert!

20:02.964 --> 20:05.005
- Mr. Monk!
- How? Tell me that!

20:05.041 --> 20:08.308
I was in prison all night!
There are 20 witnesses. Check it out.

20:08.325 --> 20:09.908
Don't think I won't.

20:10.404 --> 20:11.921
Natalie, let's go.

21:08.127 --> 21:09.144
He was here all night.

21:09.170 --> 21:12.674
Yeah, booked at 7:30 p. m. and released
at 8:00 a. m. the next morning.

21:12.819 --> 21:14.502
It was definitely him?

21:14.525 --> 21:16.725
Positive ID.
You want to see the fingerprints?

21:17.269 --> 21:19.535
- What was he in for?
- Public nuisance.

21:19.563 --> 21:21.729
He was collecting petions
at a strip mall.

21:22.713 --> 21:24.363
Strip mall.

21:24.396 --> 21:26.548
Doesn't mean anything.
That's what they're called.

21:26.568 --> 21:27.651
Well, he got out.

21:28.079 --> 21:31.096
- Somehow, he got out.
- And back in again.

21:31.475 --> 21:33.045
Without the guards noticing.

21:34.574 --> 21:35.691
Excuse me.

21:36.691 --> 21:37.908
Where did you get that?

21:38.335 --> 21:39.435
From the guard.

21:39.497 --> 21:40.602
How about this?

21:40.946 --> 21:43.080
The guard gives Singer an apple.

21:43.303 --> 21:46.121
Singer chews the apple core
into the shape of a key.

21:46.173 --> 21:50.201
He fashions a rudimentary kiln
using that light bulb and a sardine can.

21:50.229 --> 21:55.087
He hardens the apple core in his kiln,
and uses it to pick the lock. Thank you.

21:55.197 --> 21:56.530
An apple core key.

21:57.756 --> 21:58.756
No?

21:59.364 --> 22:00.364
Okay.

22:00.776 --> 22:01.776
Okay.

22:04.996 --> 22:08.129
He slipped through the bars
and out the bathroom window.

22:09.386 --> 22:10.386
How?

22:10.722 --> 22:12.222
He wiggled through. He's a nudist.

22:12.293 --> 22:13.743
They're all double-jointed.

22:13.793 --> 22:14.842
- They are?
- Randy.

22:14.876 --> 22:16.543
Don't be so naive.

22:17.705 --> 22:19.188
They're not like us.

22:19.615 --> 22:22.915
I- I have a theory.

22:23.232 --> 22:24.498
I- I think...

22:24.657 --> 22:27.391
I think they secrete a fluid.

22:27.433 --> 22:32.466
Like an oil.It's odorless, but I can
smell it. It makes them all slippery.

22:32.516 --> 22:35.115
They can wiggle through anything.
They're like slugs.

22:35.165 --> 22:38.462
Monk, nobody wiggled through anything.
There was a guard on duty all night.

22:38.478 --> 22:40.150
Then he's in on it too.
He's one of them.

22:40.164 --> 22:42.104
Well, what about the 20 cops
that are outside?

22:42.138 --> 22:43.271
They're all in on it!

22:43.856 --> 22:44.856
Don't you see?

22:45.554 --> 22:47.021
It's a cabal.

22:47.138 --> 22:49.259
- What?
- A cabal. It's a secret society.

22:49.290 --> 22:54.223
Sometimes they're naked. Sometimes
they go around dressed to confuse us.

22:54.240 --> 22:57.258
Well, they're certainly doing that.
Have you read their literature? I have.

22:57.275 --> 22:58.825
They want to convert us all.

22:58.858 --> 23:01.396
And they won't stop until we're all

23:01.463 --> 23:03.796
like them, on beaches, in parks,

23:03.829 --> 23:07.499
hanging out... everything hanging out.
Hanging and hanging.

23:08.294 --> 23:10.820
Captain, there's only one way
to deal with them.

23:11.725 --> 23:13.556
We gotta ship them back.

23:17.632 --> 23:19.516
Ship them back where, Monk?

23:21.583 --> 23:22.700
Exactly.

23:29.807 --> 23:30.874
Sit down.

23:32.779 --> 23:33.879
Sit down.

23:44.047 --> 23:45.047
Sit down.

23:49.206 --> 23:51.611
Look, I don't know what happened
on that beach Monday night.

23:51.644 --> 23:53.246
I do not know who killed that girl.

23:53.284 --> 23:55.202
- Actually,
- I have another... Let me finish.

23:55.469 --> 23:56.469
Don't you talk.

23:56.652 --> 23:58.073
This is not a conversation.

23:59.648 --> 24:00.911
This is an intervention.

24:01.660 --> 24:02.972
I'll tell you what I do know.

24:03.392 --> 24:04.392
Number one...

24:04.642 --> 24:06.573
- it was not Chance Singer.
- Captain!

24:06.583 --> 24:09.010
Chance Singer was
in my jail all night long.

24:09.073 --> 24:11.457
Number two... you are off this case.

24:12.244 --> 24:13.258
You...

24:13.851 --> 24:15.869
You-you're defending them?

24:16.436 --> 24:18.268
Monk, this is San Francisco!

24:19.179 --> 24:22.760
There's a million weirdoes out there.
Some of them are wearing clothes.

24:23.363 --> 24:24.578
Some of them are not.

24:26.980 --> 24:29.796
And yes, I am defending them.
That's what this means.

24:30.593 --> 24:31.606
We defend them.

24:34.252 --> 24:35.862
I spend a lot of my time...

24:36.029 --> 24:37.848
too much of my time... trying to keep

24:37.849 --> 24:39.626
bigotry and racism
out of this department.

24:39.725 --> 24:42.097
- I am not a bigot.
- I don't know what else to call it.

24:42.144 --> 24:44.224
You wanna put this guy away
for the rest of his life

24:44.259 --> 24:45.767
because he makes you uncomfortable.

24:48.239 --> 24:50.102
Look, you've always had issues.

24:51.497 --> 24:54.075
But this isn't just
another quirk or phobia.

24:55.622 --> 24:59.092
Like, uh, your fear of clowns
or round things.

24:59.122 --> 25:00.359
This is different.

25:00.855 --> 25:01.945
This is new.

25:03.380 --> 25:04.394
And weird.

25:05.560 --> 25:06.560
And ugly.

25:06.808 --> 25:09.137
First of all, I am not
afraid of round things...

25:09.167 --> 25:10.613
Monk, you're a great detective.

25:12.112 --> 25:13.575
Look at it like it's a mystery.

25:14.607 --> 25:16.291
There's something going on here.

25:17.377 --> 25:19.299
Something's going on inside of you.

25:21.004 --> 25:22.033
Figure it out.

25:23.616 --> 25:24.629
Detective.

25:26.087 --> 25:28.174
I don't wanna see you
back here until you do.

25:45.199 --> 25:48.225
- This is... this is not fair treatment.
- How do people wear these things?

25:48.255 --> 25:51.236
- I feel like I'm suffocating. I know.
- I'm chafing.

25:51.326 --> 25:52.602
Are you chafing?

25:52.632 --> 25:56.073
Hey, does anyone have any more
of that powder? I need it.

25:56.138 --> 25:59.868
- Hey, there he is.
- Here he comes, here he comes.

26:01.836 --> 26:06.502
- Peter... It's Magneri.
- Peter! Mr. Magneri. Channel 7 News.

26:06.553 --> 26:08.292
- How do you feel?
- I feel great.

26:08.381 --> 26:11.109
I feel the Board of Supervisors
will do the right thing.

26:11.426 --> 26:13.193
They understand
that I'm just a taxpayer.

26:13.223 --> 26:16.543
All I want is a front lawn of my own
where I can relax and play with my kids.

26:16.588 --> 26:19.088
The problem is, Mr. Magneri,
Barr Beach is not for sale.

26:19.117 --> 26:21.487
It belongs to the people
of San Francisco.

26:21.517 --> 26:23.291
Mr. Singer, is that really you?

26:23.336 --> 26:26.202
I didn't recognize you with your
clothes on. You look almost human.

26:26.726 --> 26:30.558
California has been
blessed with 1,200 miles

26:30.588 --> 26:31.629
of coastline.

26:31.655 --> 26:34.832
Surely there's another beach somewhere
where Mr. Singer and his freaky friends

26:34.847 --> 26:36.174
can throw their Frisbees.

26:37.100 --> 26:41.246
The real issue here is that I am a
high-profile individual.

26:41.566 --> 26:44.652
I need my own beach for my privacy
and my personal security.

26:44.671 --> 26:48.154
A young woman, as you may recall, was
murdered on that beach only recently.

26:48.698 --> 26:51.888
And the police have been questioning
Mr. Singer about that very incident.

26:51.948 --> 26:54.285
You can't say that.
You can't just accuse people.

26:54.315 --> 26:57.585
I'm not accusing you, sir.
Adrian Monk is accusing you.

26:57.977 --> 27:00.323
Mr. Monk happens to be
the finest detective

27:00.353 --> 27:02.932
in San Francisco,
and he has confided in me

27:02.961 --> 27:05.652
That Mr. Singer is his primary suspect.

27:05.693 --> 27:08.365
And you believed him?
Adrian Monk is certifiable.

27:08.391 --> 27:11.998
He was in my house last night without
a warrant, hiding in my closet.

27:12.039 --> 27:15.602
I was gonna press charges,
but frankly, I feel sorry for him.

27:15.634 --> 27:18.352
I hope he gets the help
he needs, I really do.

27:22.497 --> 27:24.183
There's something I never told you.

27:25.755 --> 27:28.572
Something happened when I was a boy.

27:30.628 --> 27:31.839
There was an incident.

27:32.482 --> 27:33.497
With a...

27:34.381 --> 27:35.429
with a man.

27:37.236 --> 27:38.431
Who was that?

27:39.974 --> 27:41.239
I'd never seen him before.

27:41.467 --> 27:42.532
Stranger.

27:44.526 --> 27:45.689
How old were you?

27:45.915 --> 27:46.963
I don't remember.

27:47.524 --> 27:48.524
Young.

27:49.270 --> 27:51.333
I was... so small.

27:54.512 --> 27:55.512
I remember...

27:57.071 --> 27:58.234
I remember...

27:59.693 --> 28:00.856
I was naked.

28:03.119 --> 28:04.249
Take your time.

28:04.385 --> 28:05.907
I was so naked.

28:06.391 --> 28:09.240
I just hated being naked.

28:10.247 --> 28:11.361
And I remember...

28:12.612 --> 28:13.857
I was crying.

28:15.665 --> 28:16.665
And then...

28:18.781 --> 28:19.911
he hit me.

28:21.835 --> 28:24.339
- Adrian, I'm so sorry.
- There was blood.

28:25.152 --> 28:27.082
There was blood everywhere.

28:28.644 --> 28:31.063
I was screaming. I wanted him to stop.

28:32.684 --> 28:33.912
And my mother...

28:35.815 --> 28:37.289
my mother was smiling.

28:38.422 --> 28:40.526
W- w-wait, your.. your mother was there?

28:40.591 --> 28:42.179
Why didn't she stop him?

28:42.497 --> 28:44.128
She was supposed to protect me.

28:44.247 --> 28:45.410
He kept hitting me.

28:46.056 --> 28:48.554
Swinging me around upside down, and...

28:50.597 --> 28:52.136
Youwere upside down?

28:56.338 --> 28:58.008
Was he wearing a mask?

29:00.594 --> 29:04.139
I never wanted to be naked again.

29:04.216 --> 29:06.159
Adrian, that man was a doctor.

29:06.225 --> 29:08.533
You're rembering your own birth.

29:10.960 --> 29:12.662
Doctor... doctor?

29:12.716 --> 29:15.946
Anybody else,
I wouldn't have believed it. But you...

29:16.319 --> 29:17.597
Doctor?

29:20.498 --> 29:22.620
Mm-hmm. Well, that would
explain a lot, actually.

29:22.680 --> 29:24.694
The lights, and my father

29:25.099 --> 29:27.980
in the doorway holding a balloon.

29:32.668 --> 29:36.465
- You feel better?
- Yes. I do.

29:42.527 --> 29:44.394
That only took 11 years.

29:49.345 --> 29:51.859
Hello! Sorry, the door was open.
Natalie, listen.

29:51.892 --> 29:54.164
Monk, I'm so glad you're here.
I was just about to call.

29:54.334 --> 29:57.575
Something happened. I was talking to
Dr. Kroger. I remembered something.

29:57.591 --> 30:00.669
Mr. Monk. There's been something I've
been trying to tell you. When I was 19

30:00.686 --> 30:03.147
- Is this gonna be a long story?
- Please let me finish.

30:03.163 --> 30:04.615
I was an exchange student in Greece.

30:04.672 --> 30:06.520
There was this
beautiful beach that was about

30:06.577 --> 30:08.467
three blocks away
that I went to all the time.

30:08.505 --> 30:10.861
- Great.
- And this is the thing, Mr. Monk. Um...

30:11.731 --> 30:14.336
It was a European beach. Which means...

30:15.399 --> 30:17.396
- Topless
- I don't care. I had a breakthrough.

30:17.461 --> 30:19.821
I was a nudist, Mr. Monk.
I was one of them.

30:19.869 --> 30:21.081
I went back four years ago,

30:21.097 --> 30:24.487
so technically I guess I still am one.
I was in the cabal.

30:24.520 --> 30:25.668
No, Natalie, forget that.

30:25.702 --> 30:28.581
I mean, maybe it means you can't
work with me anymore, but I don't care.

30:28.582 --> 30:31.291
I'm not apologizing for it.
I met the best people.

30:31.324 --> 30:33.859
It was the most amazing time of my life.

30:33.860 --> 30:37.447
Great. Natalie, listen.
I am not that guy anymore. It's okay.

30:37.545 --> 30:40.385
I had an amazing session
with Dr. Kroger.

30:40.438 --> 30:44.138
I went back. I went way back.

30:44.269 --> 30:46.361
Way, way, way, way, way back, back.

30:46.362 --> 30:48.297
Back, back, back, back, back.

30:48.368 --> 30:52.117
And I got past it. This whole
naked thing. I understand it now.

30:52.229 --> 30:54.377
- Wow.
- Yeah. And guess what I just did?

30:54.426 --> 30:57.398
I walked through Bishop Park.
You know, the big statue?

30:57.430 --> 30:59.919
The nude statue of the nude woman?

31:00.841 --> 31:01.946
I looked right at it.

31:02.212 --> 31:04.505
Mr. Monk, the statue
in Bishop Park is a man.

31:04.554 --> 31:05.801
Okay, I glanced at it.

31:05.883 --> 31:08.666
But I wasn't completely
and totally repulsed.

31:08.764 --> 31:09.976
I didn't black out.

31:10.074 --> 31:11.466
And I didn't throw up!

31:11.574 --> 31:13.569
Wow. You know, there's a word for that.

31:13.570 --> 31:15.412
- Progress.
- Progress, that's me.

31:15.461 --> 31:18.195
Only 312 other issues to go!

31:18.656 --> 31:19.909
take 'em one at a time.

31:19.945 --> 31:21.680
Let's start with dryer lint.

31:21.744 --> 31:24.432
Hey, I guess this means you owe
Chance Singer an apology.

31:24.552 --> 31:26.337
Yeah, I guess I do.

31:27.032 --> 31:28.506
Maybe I'll bring him something.

31:28.548 --> 31:32.284
Like a bottle of wine or some overalls.
What's this?

31:33.682 --> 31:34.697
What?

31:35.203 --> 31:36.284
Oh, a note.

31:36.348 --> 31:38.117
No, I mean this stationery. This is...

31:38.904 --> 31:40.535
This is from Vickie's roommate.

31:41.735 --> 31:46.772
Piece of scrap paper.
St. Andrews Medical Center.

31:47.181 --> 31:48.655
Radiology, Natalie.

31:49.812 --> 31:51.072
Radiology.

31:53.006 --> 31:54.006
My God.

31:55.246 --> 31:56.890
I think I know what happenned.

31:57.079 --> 31:59.727
- To what?
- To the girl to Vickie.

32:01.617 --> 32:03.518
Not that I can think staight.

32:05.088 --> 32:06.505
I know who killed her.

32:16.757 --> 32:19.047
- Miss Boras. Good afternoon.
- What are you doing?

32:19.048 --> 32:22.424
Searching your apartment.  he yellow
copy is for you and your lawyer.

32:22.554 --> 32:25.025
You worked at St. Andrews Hospital,
is that right?

32:25.075 --> 32:26.369
You were an X-ray technician.

32:26.435 --> 32:29.112
- Did you ever meet Peter Magneri?
- Who?

32:29.287 --> 32:32.905
Peter Magneri. He founded Magneri
Computers. They make these.

32:33.562 --> 32:34.871
I thought yours broke.

32:35.342 --> 32:38.452
Yeah, I bought another one.
90 Gigs. Life's too short, right?

32:42.850 --> 32:47.655
Mr. Magneri had a checkup July 23rd.
That's four days before you quit.

32:47.699 --> 32:50.838
I got a clean bill of health from
St. Andrews three weeks ago.

32:50.871 --> 32:52.917
They checked me for everything,
head to toe.

32:52.966 --> 32:56.396
We just spoke to the SEC. Apparently,
since July, you've been very interested

32:56.428 --> 32:59.078
in the Magneri company,
except you haven't been investing.

32:59.412 --> 33:00.590
You've been selling short.

33:00.689 --> 33:02.751
You've been betting against the company.

33:05.390 --> 33:06.945
- Randy.
- Turn it off.

33:06.994 --> 33:08.167
I'm sorry. It won't stop.

33:08.446 --> 33:09.690
Here's what happened.

33:09.828 --> 33:12.481
Three weeks ago,
Magneri went in for a checkup.

33:12.629 --> 33:14.263
You were the lab tech.

33:14.725 --> 33:17.506
You must have noticed something on his
X-rays.  Something serious.

33:17.577 --> 33:18.756
Something that could kill him.

33:18.789 --> 33:20.926
It was the ultimate piece
of inside information.

33:20.927 --> 33:22.483
Literallyinside.

33:23.218 --> 33:25.297
Peter Magneri isMagneri Computers.

33:25.526 --> 33:28.817
You knew if anything happened to him,
the stock would plummet.

33:28.978 --> 33:32.386
All you had to do was switch X-rays
and put a different label on it.

33:32.533 --> 33:34.177
Magneri got a clean bill of health.

33:34.374 --> 33:38.162
Nobody knew how sick he really was,
not him, not even his doctor.

33:38.418 --> 33:39.590
But you knew.

33:39.911 --> 33:42.268
You quit your job
and started selling short,

33:42.423 --> 33:43.815
betting against the company.

33:44.552 --> 33:49.136
When Magneri died and the stock crashed,
you'd make a small fortune.

33:51.584 --> 33:53.401
At some point, Vickie found out.

33:53.790 --> 33:56.851
Maybe you were looking for a partner.
Maybe you were just bragging.

33:56.993 --> 33:58.448
But Vickie wasn't like you.

33:58.638 --> 34:00.308
She couldn't just sit
back and do nothing

34:00.333 --> 34:02.355
and wait for another human being to die.

34:02.724 --> 34:04.279
She tried to warn Magneri.

34:04.731 --> 34:07.761
You knew you had to stop her
by any means necessary.

34:09.996 --> 34:13.902
That night, Vickie told Magneri
it was a matter of life or death.

34:13.995 --> 34:15.551
She was talking about him.

34:15.931 --> 34:16.964
His life or death.

34:16.991 --> 34:21.083
You chased her down. You killed her on
the beach and you took back the X-ray.

34:21.362 --> 34:22.518
That's insane.

34:23.175 --> 34:24.795
You don't have any... Proof?

34:25.319 --> 34:27.708
Mr. Monk found this.
It was hidden behind your toilet.

34:27.742 --> 34:31.007
- Behind your toilet.
- Got it.

34:33.353 --> 34:35.254
I don't know what she was thinking.

34:37.130 --> 34:39.815
I was even going
to share the money with her.

34:41.219 --> 34:42.972
Tell that to Vickie's family.

34:43.958 --> 34:46.266
- You're under arrest.
- You understand...

34:46.348 --> 34:49.768
if anything happens to Magneri,
anything that could've been prevented,

34:49.900 --> 34:51.619
it'll be two counts of murder.

34:53.775 --> 34:54.841
How bad is it?

34:56.210 --> 34:57.225
That spot?

34:57.422 --> 34:59.108
It's called an aortic aneurysm.

35:00.057 --> 35:01.841
He's a heart attack waiting to happen.

35:02.570 --> 35:06.139
Any excitement,
any stress at all, could kill him.

35:07.285 --> 35:10.410
The uh... the zoning board.

35:10.769 --> 35:14.976
This is disher On his way to the calipor
House Be the paramedics standing by 

35:15.035 --> 35:17.027
I repeat Paramedics standing by

35:17.134 --> 35:18.534
E.T.A 10 minutes.

35:18.685 --> 35:21.051
Roger that, paramedics are on their way.

35:22.618 --> 35:23.726
What?!

35:24.370 --> 35:26.107
What kind of verdict is that?

35:26.141 --> 35:27.860
You're pathetic, all of you.

35:27.909 --> 35:30.555
Mr. Magneri, please sit down.
The decision of the board is final.

35:30.610 --> 35:33.382
I will not sit down. This is a travesty!

35:33.464 --> 35:35.363
They don't even pay their taxes!

35:37.814 --> 35:38.829
Hello?

35:39.594 --> 35:42.788
Oh, thank God. Mr. Singer,
it's Adrian Monk. Don't hang up.

35:43.181 --> 35:45.401
Oh, Monk, I don't want
to talk to you right now.

35:45.418 --> 35:47.513
I'm in too good of a mood.
We just won our case.

35:47.562 --> 35:50.605
Ugh, the hippies won.
Is Peter Magneri still there?

35:50.639 --> 35:51.923
Yeah, why do you care?

35:52.855 --> 35:55.343
Chance, you've gotta trust me.
It's a matter of life or death.

35:55.485 --> 35:56.850
What do you mean, life or death?

35:57.731 --> 36:01.963
Oh, put your clothes back on,
you freaks! Oh, this isn't over.

36:02.004 --> 36:04.808
I'm gonna appeal this
all the way to Sacramento!

36:04.851 --> 36:06.914
- We can't appeal. It's a...
- Shut up!

36:07.050 --> 36:08.278
You are so fired.

36:08.312 --> 36:10.230
Uh, Mr. Councilman,
members of the board.

36:10.263 --> 36:11.880
I'd like to have your attention.

36:11.916 --> 36:13.865
Could I have everyone's attention?

36:14.520 --> 36:15.715
Uh... the Naturist

36:15.781 --> 36:18.530
Beachfront Committee would like to
withdraw its petion at this time.

36:18.575 --> 36:20.756
- What?
- Are you crazy?

36:20.807 --> 36:23.164
Mr. Singer, the board
has decided in your favor.

36:23.197 --> 36:26.512
We've granted your group the rights
to that property in perpetuity.

36:26.564 --> 36:28.346
Well, we're giving it back.

36:28.749 --> 36:31.812
You know, we were talking about it,
and... and the beach is a little rocky

36:31.885 --> 36:35.112
for our tastes, a little tough on the
feet. So we're gonna find another beach.

36:37.224 --> 36:40.416
Wait a minute, Singer. Is this a trick?

36:41.107 --> 36:44.989
No, my friend. This is no trick.
You've won. The beach is yours.

36:45.415 --> 36:47.576
You've won. Breathe.

36:47.906 --> 36:49.575
Relax. That's good, sit.

36:49.689 --> 36:51.392
Let me adjust your chi.

36:52.069 --> 36:53.959
- What's going on?
- Mr. Magneri.

36:54.785 --> 36:56.536
Sir, we need to get you to the hospital.

36:56.578 --> 36:58.934
- Hospital?
- Trust me, sir. You're a very sick man.

36:58.966 --> 37:02.097
- I'll explain everything on the way.
- He's right sir. I've seen your X-rays.

37:02.134 --> 37:03.873
We've got an ambulance
waiting downstairs.

37:03.905 --> 37:05.480
- X- ray?
- Hi. Remember me?

37:05.546 --> 37:08.174
Listen, I don't want
to upset you or anything,

37:08.191 --> 37:10.246
but... my MagnaPod died.
No, I bought another one.

37:10.303 --> 37:12.128
It's the second one
I've bought in 3 months.

37:12.161 --> 37:13.927
Randy, give it a rest.
No, it's no big deal.

37:13.994 --> 37:16.172
You see, it just keeps
getting stuck on "menu."

37:16.218 --> 37:18.336
So, I mean, and my Walkman
never did that.

37:18.374 --> 37:20.633
Well, get yourself another Walkman!
Leave me alone.

37:20.732 --> 37:24.439
No, no, it's no big deal. Here,

37:24.570 --> 37:25.644
put it in here...

37:25.671 --> 37:28.503
Randy, Randy, Randy!
Randy, give me this. Give me this.

37:33.635 --> 37:34.814
You're right, it's broken.

37:45.376 --> 37:47.146
- hello!
- Hi

37:47.362 --> 37:48.362
Hi

37:48.793 --> 37:50.702
- You're moving?
- Oh, yeah.

37:51.040 --> 37:52.105
Moving on up.

37:52.228 --> 37:54.749
Peter Magneri bought us our
own island down the coast.

37:54.834 --> 37:57.151
It's the least he could do.
You saved his life.

37:57.287 --> 38:00.636
Oh, well, yeah, sure. I'm his neighbor.
That's what neighbors do, right?

38:02.321 --> 38:04.270
- Mr. Monk?
- Yeah, look at that cloud.

38:04.895 --> 38:06.804
What does that cloud
look like to you?

38:09.357 --> 38:11.153
- What cloud?
- Oh, there's a cloud.

38:11.199 --> 38:13.821
- Way up there.
- You guys talk.

38:14.220 --> 38:15.983
I'm gonna keep looking at it
for a while.

38:16.000 --> 38:19.061
Well, hey if you're ever in, uh, San
Diego, give us a call. You won't have to

38:19.087 --> 38:21.123
- crouch in the closet this time.
- Okay.

38:21.172 --> 38:23.964
I'd love to. But I promised
Mr. Monk I wouldn't be visiting

38:24.004 --> 38:26.689
any nude beaches until
five years after he's dead.

38:28.508 --> 38:30.793
Mr. Monk, wasn't there something
you wanted to say?

38:30.826 --> 38:33.036
Uh, yeah. Chance...

38:33.602 --> 38:35.907
I'm sorry for hating you
and accusing you of murder,

38:35.941 --> 38:38.249
and I've learned a lot,
and I'm a better person.

38:39.265 --> 38:44.299
Hey, you know we're all just caught here
on this crazy, big blue marble

38:44.353 --> 38:46.301
doing the best we can. Am I right?

38:46.530 --> 38:47.823
Yeah, right. Right?

38:49.194 --> 38:51.697
Come here. Come here.

38:52.632 --> 38:53.632
Come here.

38:55.191 --> 38:56.338
He wants a hug.

38:58.004 --> 39:02.169
Come on. Come here.
Little closer. Come on.

39:03.177 --> 39:04.177
Oh, yeah.

39:04.762 --> 39:05.842
Good.

39:06.797 --> 39:07.797
Good.

39:09.230 --> 39:10.230
Oh, yeah.

39:11.665 --> 39:12.897
You're a good hugger.

39:12.974 --> 39:14.824
You smell good.

39:18.029 --> 39:19.139
Real good.

39:19.620 --> 39:24.253
Good. Good. Thanks.

39:28.476 --> 39:30.510
- You want a wipe?
- No, I'm good.

39:34.906 --> 39:36.004
Mr. Monk?

39:39.684 --> 39:40.684
Mr. Monk?

39:43.177 --> 39:44.177
Mr. Monk!
