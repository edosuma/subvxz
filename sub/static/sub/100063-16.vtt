WEBVTT

00:02.648 --> 00:05.634
Here we are, lovers. Our
third stop on the tour,

00:05.659 --> 00:07.469
Tantalus Lookout.

00:07.493 --> 00:11.329
This spot offers scenic views
of Diamond Head and Waikiki

00:11.364 --> 00:14.366
and is one of the most popular
marriage proposal spots

00:14.400 --> 00:15.834
on the island.

00:15.868 --> 00:17.969
You having fun, boo?

00:18.004 --> 00:20.272
So much fun. This is a wonderful idea.

00:20.306 --> 00:21.506
Oh, I love you.

00:21.541 --> 00:22.574
I love you more.

00:22.608 --> 00:25.177
Yeah, I know what you're thinking.

00:25.211 --> 00:27.779
But trust me,
it's not what it looks like.

00:27.814 --> 00:29.881
Sometimes, as a private investigator,

00:29.916 --> 00:30.975
you have to put on an act

00:31.009 --> 00:33.285
to catch someone in the middle of one.

00:33.319 --> 00:34.519
Like these two.

00:34.554 --> 00:36.788
They are getting closer.

00:36.823 --> 00:37.989
Babe, take our selfie.

00:38.024 --> 00:39.491
That is a wonderful idea.

00:39.525 --> 00:42.561
- It's such a beautiful view up here.
- Mm-hmm.

00:42.595 --> 00:44.796
Yeah.

00:44.831 --> 00:46.464
I think that might be enough.

00:46.499 --> 00:48.333
Krista's husband wants conclusive proof

00:48.367 --> 00:49.801
of her infidelity.

00:49.836 --> 00:52.304
This looks fairly platonic to me.

00:52.338 --> 00:53.538
Come on, they bought overpriced tickets

00:53.573 --> 00:56.174
to this hopelessly romantic bus tour.

00:56.209 --> 00:57.426
It's definitely not platonic.

00:57.461 --> 00:59.477
- These two are having an affair.
- Look, I want

00:59.512 --> 01:02.080
to get off this bus from hell
as much as you do,

01:02.114 --> 01:03.849
but we need hard evidence.

01:03.883 --> 01:05.483
Full-on PDA.

01:05.518 --> 01:06.842
Copy that.

01:07.676 --> 01:10.355
You know, while we're up here,
we might as well take a picture.

01:10.389 --> 01:11.423
Get over here, boo. Come on.

01:11.457 --> 01:13.992
When there's no one here,
you needn't call me "boo."

01:14.026 --> 01:15.927
And since Krista and Gil
aren't posing for a photo,

01:15.962 --> 01:16.928
we needn't, either.

01:16.963 --> 01:19.497
I'd rather get hit in the face
with a golf shoe.

01:19.532 --> 01:21.399
Did somebody say golf?

01:21.434 --> 01:24.185
Gladys and I are avid players.

01:24.220 --> 01:26.171
- Really? So is she.
- Yeah.

01:26.205 --> 01:27.539
Ain't that right, boo?

01:27.573 --> 01:29.207
Mmm. Yeah, I play a little.

01:29.242 --> 01:30.508
Good for you.

01:30.543 --> 01:32.544
So, how long have you guys been together?

01:32.578 --> 01:34.512
Oh, just a year.

01:34.547 --> 01:37.015
We had both given up
on finding true love,

01:37.049 --> 01:38.250
and then we found each other.

01:38.284 --> 01:40.115
It was a whirlwind courtship.

01:40.150 --> 01:41.184
Then we just said

01:41.209 --> 01:42.921
"What the hell?" And we tied the knot.

01:42.955 --> 01:46.524
Ah, yes. "Tie the knot,"
that custom in antiquity

01:46.559 --> 01:49.094
where couples are literally tied
to one another

01:49.128 --> 01:51.630
in ceremony to signify their bond.

01:51.664 --> 01:53.198
Oh.

01:53.232 --> 01:55.901
I take it you two are just dating.

01:55.935 --> 01:58.203
Yeah, she's British.
She doesn't get humor.

01:59.331 --> 02:00.431
So, how'd you two meet?

02:00.456 --> 02:01.656
We met online.

02:01.681 --> 02:03.111
- I see.
- Well, I guess young people

02:03.136 --> 02:04.373
are doing that these days.

02:04.577 --> 02:05.911
I guess so.

02:07.373 --> 02:08.907
Well, it was nice meeting you both.

02:09.080 --> 02:10.548
Very nice to meet you.

02:12.251 --> 02:14.052
- What a sweet couple.
- Mm.

02:14.086 --> 02:16.421
Oh, uh, nice add-on for the
cover story, by the way.

02:16.455 --> 02:17.489
That whole online dating thing.

02:17.523 --> 02:18.924
I may not believe in online dating,

02:18.958 --> 02:21.393
but it doesn't mean I can't
use it to service our assignment.

02:21.427 --> 02:22.894
Operation Swipe Right.

02:22.929 --> 02:24.629
Let's go, hopeless romantics.

02:24.664 --> 02:26.598
Next stop, the beach where they shot

02:26.632 --> 02:30.468
the classic romantic drama
From Here to Eternity.

02:30.503 --> 02:32.170
Oh, joy.

02:32.204 --> 02:34.235
Come on, loosen up. We're
gonna have some fun.

02:48.721 --> 02:50.989
Krista and Gil passed on the photo.

02:51.023 --> 02:52.023
They're not even holding hands.

02:52.058 --> 02:53.191
They're giving us nothing.

02:53.225 --> 02:54.326
Be patient.

02:54.360 --> 02:56.618
Good things come to those who wait.

02:57.229 --> 02:58.330
Like these two right here.

02:58.364 --> 03:02.100
It took a while, but they
got the shot they wanted.

03:02.134 --> 03:04.002
You're a sucker for romance.

03:04.036 --> 03:06.671
For once, we agree.

03:06.706 --> 03:09.607
Okay, follow me, lovebirds.

04:07.633 --> 04:10.368
And here we are.

04:10.403 --> 04:13.238
The perfect spot
for your romantic picnic.

04:13.272 --> 04:15.607
Let me just unload your baskets,
and then you can explore

04:15.641 --> 04:18.243
all the wonders
Puu Hele crest has to offer.

04:18.277 --> 04:20.111
We'll head for our next stop in an hour.

04:20.146 --> 04:21.512
Okay.

04:21.547 --> 04:23.181
I'm thinking we grab our food last

04:23.215 --> 04:24.957
and then tail Krista and Gil
from a distance.

04:24.991 --> 04:27.619
Yeah. Let's just get
the proof that we need

04:27.653 --> 04:28.686
and get out of here.

04:28.721 --> 04:30.418
Come on. After all those places,

04:30.453 --> 04:32.146
- you still don't get it, do you?
- Get it?

04:32.180 --> 04:34.592
What is there to get? You mean
this contrived exploitation

04:34.627 --> 04:36.201
of amorous love? No, I don't get it.

04:36.235 --> 04:37.629
Maybe you should go out more often.

04:37.663 --> 04:39.431
I mean, when was the last time
you went on a date?

04:39.465 --> 04:40.598
It was with Christian Yelich, right?

04:40.633 --> 04:42.767
That was, like, a year ago.

04:42.802 --> 04:45.303
Can we just focus
on Gil and Krista's love life

04:45.337 --> 04:46.504
and less on mine, please?

04:47.473 --> 04:49.374
You're right, boo. Let's go.

04:49.408 --> 04:51.142
We should hold hands, though.

04:51.177 --> 04:52.710
Try to sell the character,
you know what I mean?

04:52.745 --> 04:55.415
I think the character should
stay silent at all times.

04:55.450 --> 04:57.782
Everybody, come grab
your baskets. All right.

04:57.817 --> 05:00.318
Larry and Ken, you're over here.

05:00.352 --> 05:02.554
Gladys and Bert,

05:02.588 --> 05:04.556
this one's for you guys.

05:04.590 --> 05:06.558
- All right.
- Where do we go?

05:06.592 --> 05:08.566
Just up that hill. The view
is beautiful. Take a look.

05:08.600 --> 05:10.328
- Eddie and Paula.
- Oh, yeah.

05:10.362 --> 05:11.396
- Thank you.
- There you are.

05:11.430 --> 05:12.664
Ooh. Sorry.

05:12.698 --> 05:14.766
Last but not least, Thomas and Juliet.

05:14.800 --> 05:15.767
Here.

05:15.801 --> 05:17.402
Not so fast.

05:18.370 --> 05:19.838
Is there a problem?

05:19.872 --> 05:21.008
You can say that.

05:21.043 --> 05:23.608
I've been manning this bus
for the last six years.

05:23.642 --> 05:25.076
Over 300 tours, I've observed

05:25.111 --> 05:26.644
over 2,000 couples.

05:26.679 --> 05:29.247
And you two? No way you two are together.

05:29.281 --> 05:31.616
You've got zero romantic energy.

05:32.885 --> 05:34.017
We're just not

05:34.051 --> 05:35.300
- into PDAs.
- Yeah.

05:35.324 --> 05:37.359
Try again. I've seen
the two of you watching

05:37.393 --> 05:39.194
Krista and Gil, and since I don't want

05:39.228 --> 05:41.429
any trouble brewing
between my passengers,

05:41.464 --> 05:44.532
that leaves me with just one question.

05:44.567 --> 05:46.167
Who the hell are you people?

05:48.638 --> 05:56.638
Synced & corrected by -robtor-
www.addic7ed.com

06:09.926 --> 06:11.893
Either come clean now

06:11.928 --> 06:13.962
or enjoy a long hike back into town.

06:14.964 --> 06:15.904
Suit yourself.

06:15.938 --> 06:17.565
Nothing but mud and bugs for miles.

06:17.600 --> 06:18.608
Just tell him. We haven't got time.

06:18.643 --> 06:20.235
- Yeah, we can't tell him.
- Just say.

06:20.269 --> 06:21.436
Excuse me. Come here, come here.

06:21.470 --> 06:22.671
Come here.

06:22.705 --> 06:24.572
Don't be so dramatic, all right?

06:24.607 --> 06:25.839
Truth is,

06:25.873 --> 06:27.409
we ar partners.

06:27.829 --> 06:29.511
Just in a professional sense.

06:29.831 --> 06:31.313
Okay.

06:31.347 --> 06:34.349
We're... private investigators.

06:34.383 --> 06:35.483
You're kidding.

06:35.518 --> 06:37.585
Krista and Gil are married.
Just not to each other.

06:37.620 --> 06:39.087
And Krista's husband thinks

06:39.121 --> 06:40.155
she's been cheating with a coworker.

06:40.189 --> 06:42.424
So when she told him
that she was going to Hawaii

06:42.458 --> 06:44.592
on a corporate team-building
retreat with colleagues,

06:44.627 --> 06:47.095
he figured it would be
more pleasure than business.

06:47.129 --> 06:49.408
So he hired the two of you
to get proof of the affair.

06:49.443 --> 06:50.449
Yes.

06:50.483 --> 06:52.600
And we think he deserves to know.

06:52.635 --> 06:55.437
So if you could,
just keep this conversation

06:55.471 --> 06:56.938
- between us, all right?
- Okay?

06:56.973 --> 06:58.373
Yeah. That's gonna be a hard no.

06:58.407 --> 06:59.407
I'm sorry?

06:59.442 --> 07:02.310
- Ku'uipo's about love, not judgment.
- Right.

07:02.345 --> 07:03.378
We're not asking you to judge.

07:03.412 --> 07:06.201
We just want you to exercise
a little discretion.

07:08.484 --> 07:10.452
You two lovebirds enjoy the tour.

07:10.486 --> 07:12.454
Right on. Have a good day.

07:15.324 --> 07:18.994
So, even though you haven't
been on a date in forever,

07:19.028 --> 07:20.628
you still wouldn't use a dating app?

07:20.663 --> 07:22.630
No, absolutely not.

07:22.665 --> 07:24.532
It's an absurdly superficial medium

07:24.567 --> 07:26.668
where people hide behind curated profiles

07:26.702 --> 07:30.405
and use the same ridiculous
one-liners over and over again.

07:30.439 --> 07:32.307
In my opinion, you should meet someone

07:32.341 --> 07:33.241
and get to know them in the real world.

07:33.275 --> 07:34.977
It's not like that anymore, Higgy.

07:35.012 --> 07:36.144
You know, if you met somebody at a bar,

07:36.178 --> 07:37.857
they might think you're a stalker.

07:42.351 --> 07:44.552
Magnum. Magnum.

07:46.455 --> 07:48.523
This is great, babe.

08:03.773 --> 08:05.407
Okay, is that enough PDA for you?

08:05.441 --> 08:07.509
Mm-hmm.

08:07.543 --> 08:10.145
- Gonna get closer.
- Okay, but shh.

08:12.381 --> 08:14.482
Yeah, let's go here.

08:16.552 --> 08:18.520
Uh...

08:18.554 --> 08:19.788
Why are you calling me?

08:19.822 --> 08:22.057
I-I think it's a butt-dial.

08:22.091 --> 08:23.491
Hello?

08:25.428 --> 08:27.662
Hey. Didn't know you guys were up here.

08:27.687 --> 08:29.743
That's okay. We were moving anyway.

08:34.236 --> 08:36.438
- Well done.
- "Well done"?

08:36.472 --> 08:38.039
Your phone went off.

08:38.073 --> 08:39.541
Are you seriously gonna
use that as a defense?

08:39.575 --> 08:41.796
You should've turned your ringer off.

08:48.451 --> 08:50.151
Dude.

08:50.186 --> 08:52.087
What's going on?
What's the big emergency?

08:52.121 --> 08:54.222
Well, it's not much of an emergency.

08:54.256 --> 08:57.392
You texted me and said,
"Get down here. Code red."

08:57.426 --> 08:58.626
How is that not an emergency?

08:58.661 --> 09:01.200
All right, I may have overstated
the emergency part.

09:01.235 --> 09:03.398
- Orville.
- But for good reason. It better be, man.

09:03.432 --> 09:05.100
I got a client in 20 minutes.

09:05.974 --> 09:08.876
I think that woman over there is Teresa.

09:09.772 --> 09:11.406
You never met Teresa.

09:11.440 --> 09:12.407
How would you know if that's her?

09:12.441 --> 09:14.409
Because I saw her photo
taped to the dashboard

09:14.443 --> 09:16.411
of your chopper
on every mission we went on.

09:16.445 --> 09:18.613
I'm telling you, I think that's her.

09:27.456 --> 09:28.456
Does kind of look like her.

09:28.491 --> 09:29.791
You got to go check and see.

09:29.825 --> 09:31.726
Just do a flyby, come back.

09:43.705 --> 09:45.772
Theodore?

09:51.987 --> 09:53.955
Wow, i-it is you.

09:54.817 --> 09:56.259
Teresa, hey.

09:56.294 --> 09:57.452
I can't believe it.

09:57.486 --> 09:58.853
It's been...

09:58.888 --> 10:00.522
- A while.
- Yeah.

10:02.168 --> 10:03.491
Hey.

10:03.526 --> 10:04.626
I'm Andy.

10:04.660 --> 10:06.494
Oh! Oh, sorry.

10:06.529 --> 10:07.862
Oh, hey.

10:08.216 --> 10:09.330
This is my husband.

10:10.051 --> 10:11.166
Nice to meet you.

10:11.200 --> 10:12.400
We're, uh, we're on our honeymoon.

10:14.270 --> 10:16.471
Uh, are you here on vacation?

10:16.808 --> 10:18.473
Oh, no, this is home now.

10:18.507 --> 10:21.809
Yeah, um, I moved
to the island when I got back.

10:22.838 --> 10:25.313
Yeah, I have a helicopter tour business.

10:25.347 --> 10:27.148
- Wow, that's great.
- Yeah.

10:27.183 --> 10:28.987
I'm so happy for you.

10:29.418 --> 10:30.718
Thanks.

10:33.158 --> 10:34.923
It's really good to see you.

10:34.957 --> 10:36.491
Yeah. Good to see you, too.

10:36.525 --> 10:38.493
Oh, and congratulations.

10:38.527 --> 10:39.727
Yeah.

10:39.762 --> 10:42.208
- Thank you.
- You guys enjoy.

10:52.474 --> 10:53.970
You good, buddy?

10:55.411 --> 10:57.579
Yeah, man, I'm-I'm good.

11:02.395 --> 11:03.685
All I'm saying is,

11:03.719 --> 11:05.186
personally, I find it refreshing

11:05.221 --> 11:06.499
when a man can muster up the courage

11:06.534 --> 11:08.890
to ask me out in person
opposed to using some app.

11:08.924 --> 11:10.391
Okay, so in this clear hypothetical,

11:10.426 --> 11:11.893
do you ever say yes?

11:11.927 --> 11:13.428
I said, "I find it refreshing."

11:13.462 --> 11:14.696
So, that's a no.

11:14.730 --> 11:16.397
Help! Help!

11:16.432 --> 11:18.499
We need help over here!

11:20.402 --> 11:22.904
Somebody get over here!

11:22.938 --> 11:24.505
Help!

11:25.474 --> 11:26.708
What's wrong?

11:26.742 --> 11:28.209
There's somebody down there!

11:28.244 --> 11:29.410
Oh, my God!

11:30.412 --> 11:31.846
It's Bert!

11:32.681 --> 11:34.549
Magnum?!

11:34.583 --> 11:35.750
Is he crazy?

11:41.590 --> 11:43.258
Call 911!

11:53.869 --> 11:55.156
There's no cell service.

12:06.448 --> 12:09.450
Bert, you with me, buddy?

12:10.486 --> 12:11.653
Is he okay?

12:19.495 --> 12:20.595
Magnum?

12:22.464 --> 12:23.431
Magnum?

12:23.465 --> 12:24.732
He's-he's dead.

12:45.498 --> 12:47.488
Higgins, look at his eyes.

12:47.523 --> 12:48.723
See those red spots?

12:48.757 --> 12:50.725
Petechial hemorrhaging?

12:50.759 --> 12:52.393
That a sign of strangulation.

12:52.428 --> 12:53.461
That's what it is.

12:53.495 --> 12:56.497
Bert might have been dead
before he hit the water.

12:56.532 --> 12:57.999
So this could've been murder.

12:58.428 --> 13:00.001
And if that's the case,

13:00.388 --> 13:02.337
one of them could have done it.

13:11.111 --> 13:12.533
We have to keep them calm.

13:12.558 --> 13:14.126
We don't want to start a panic.

13:14.160 --> 13:15.660
We also have to alert HPD.

13:15.695 --> 13:17.694
If Bert's body stays on
the shore much longer,

13:17.729 --> 13:19.090
the heat's gonna degrade evidence.

13:19.124 --> 13:21.034
Unless the water's
already washed it away.

13:22.535 --> 13:24.603
He's dead, isn't he?

13:24.864 --> 13:26.131
I'm afraid so.

13:27.777 --> 13:29.377
Do you know what happened to him?

13:31.210 --> 13:33.048
Think it was an accident.

13:33.495 --> 13:35.263
He must have slipped off.

13:37.920 --> 13:38.954
Where's Gladys?

13:38.988 --> 13:39.921
I heard her say something

13:39.956 --> 13:41.790
about an asthma attack
on our way up here.

13:41.824 --> 13:42.958
She might have gotten winded
from the hike

13:42.992 --> 13:44.125
and gone back to the bus?

13:45.433 --> 13:46.628
Well, we got

13:46.662 --> 13:49.798
to find Gladys and, uh,
tell her what happened.

13:49.832 --> 13:51.433
What about Bert? We just
gonna leave him down there?

13:51.467 --> 13:53.635
Maybe one of us should stay here.

13:53.669 --> 13:55.937
It's possible
Larry's just being thoughtful,

13:55.972 --> 13:57.739
but since everyone's a suspect,

13:57.773 --> 14:00.809
we can't risk leaving anyone
behind to tamper with the body.

14:00.843 --> 14:02.813
No. It'll be fine.

14:02.848 --> 14:05.814
I mean, there's nothing
we can do for him now.

14:05.848 --> 14:07.284
She's right.

14:07.318 --> 14:09.150
We should wait for the police
to recover him.

14:09.540 --> 14:11.019
Yeah.

14:11.417 --> 14:13.788
We should, uh,
start heading back to the bus.

14:13.823 --> 14:15.056
Got it.

14:23.096 --> 14:24.799
Gladys's husband was just killed,

14:24.834 --> 14:26.768
and now she's unaccounted for.

14:26.802 --> 14:27.669
She could be in danger.

14:27.703 --> 14:29.671
Or maybe she killed Bert and took off.

14:29.705 --> 14:31.773
I highly doubt that
sweet Gladys had the strength

14:31.807 --> 14:33.808
to choke Bert, then
throw him off a cliff.

14:33.843 --> 14:36.401
You know, at this point I'm
not counting anything out.

14:53.730 --> 14:55.009
Hey.

14:57.733 --> 14:59.173
Hey.

14:59.735 --> 15:01.169
What are you doing here?

15:01.203 --> 15:02.837
Ah, I had some time to kill.

15:02.872 --> 15:03.905
Andy went to play golf.

15:04.137 --> 15:05.707
You still hate golf, huh?

15:05.741 --> 15:06.841
More than anything.

15:08.323 --> 15:11.713
Uh, I just... I wanted
to stop by and chat, catch up.

15:11.747 --> 15:13.214
I would like that.

15:15.440 --> 15:17.719
But I, uh... I got
to go to the other side

15:17.753 --> 15:19.721
of the island and pick up a part.

15:19.755 --> 15:21.404
Was just about to take off.

15:22.291 --> 15:23.825
You know...

15:23.859 --> 15:26.361
I've never been in a helicopter before.

15:26.588 --> 15:28.422
You asking to come with?

15:30.244 --> 15:31.945
Yeah.

15:33.402 --> 15:35.403
I don't know if that's a good idea.

15:35.438 --> 15:36.705
Why not?

15:36.739 --> 15:37.825
Because you got married.

15:37.860 --> 15:39.631
So what? I just want to talk.

15:39.666 --> 15:42.744
Things were kind of
unresolved between us.

15:43.634 --> 15:45.447
Yeah, that's for sure.

15:46.304 --> 15:47.716
So?

15:47.750 --> 15:49.284
What do you say?

15:51.931 --> 15:54.432
Larry and Ken were the first
to see the body, right?

15:54.457 --> 15:56.224
Yeah, that immediately
puts them under suspicion.

15:56.258 --> 15:58.126
Yeah, but Krista and Gil
arrived moments later,

15:58.160 --> 15:59.427
which means they were close.

15:59.462 --> 16:01.043
Yeah, also suspicious.

16:01.384 --> 16:02.612
Is it me...

16:03.566 --> 16:05.467
or does Gil seem a bit anxious?

16:05.823 --> 16:07.268
He did just see a dead body.

16:07.303 --> 16:08.938
Maybe he had something to do with it.

16:08.972 --> 16:10.872
Or perhaps he's worried about his affair

16:10.906 --> 16:13.127
with Krista coming out once
the police start investigating.

16:13.161 --> 16:14.248
Yeah.

16:28.304 --> 16:29.824
I'm gonna go tell Gladys.

16:29.859 --> 16:32.427
- No, no. Let me do it.
- You sure?

16:33.761 --> 16:35.033
Okay.

16:37.063 --> 16:38.767
This is so horrible.

16:38.801 --> 16:40.066
I know.

16:58.521 --> 17:00.355
What are you saying?

17:00.389 --> 17:02.490
He was just there. He was just there.

17:02.525 --> 17:04.965
What are you talking about?

17:11.400 --> 17:14.969
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

17:22.243 --> 17:23.310
What's going on?

17:23.345 --> 17:25.480
There's been an accident.

17:25.513 --> 17:28.148
Bert fell off a cliff and, uh...

17:28.184 --> 17:30.151
he didn't make it.

17:30.186 --> 17:31.486
- Oh, my God.
- Yeah.

17:31.826 --> 17:33.488
Look, we're gonna have
to call the police,

17:33.522 --> 17:35.290
but I don't have a signal.

17:35.324 --> 17:37.859
Does anybody have cell phone service?

17:39.877 --> 17:41.896
- I've got nothing.
- Me, either.

17:41.931 --> 17:43.527
We'll get service
once we get out of the valley.

17:43.561 --> 17:44.999
I'll get the bus started.

17:45.034 --> 17:46.634
Wait. Hold on.

17:46.669 --> 17:49.504
Wait. When did Gladys return
from her picnic with Bert?

17:49.538 --> 17:51.339
Not too long after they set out.

17:51.373 --> 17:52.630
Said she wasn't feeling well.

17:52.664 --> 17:54.142
And were you with her the whole time?

17:54.176 --> 17:55.343
Yeah. Why are you asking?

17:55.377 --> 17:56.644
Um, don't worry about it.

17:56.679 --> 17:58.613
We'll-we'll meet you at the bus.

18:03.024 --> 18:05.899
Gladys's grief is...
is absolutely genuine,

18:05.934 --> 18:07.388
and there's no way she did it.

18:07.423 --> 18:09.424
Yeah. Stan says he was
with her the whole time,

18:09.458 --> 18:10.658
so we could eliminate those two.

18:13.259 --> 18:15.563
So it has to be one of the others.

18:17.279 --> 18:19.447
Yes, it does.

18:27.309 --> 18:28.510
Is there a problem?

18:28.544 --> 18:30.912
Yeah. It started
but then it just stopped.

18:30.946 --> 18:31.946
What's wrong with it?

18:31.981 --> 18:32.881
Not sure.

18:32.915 --> 18:34.582
I mean, I'm a tour guide, not a mechanic.

18:34.617 --> 18:36.050
Larry could check it out.

18:36.085 --> 18:37.619
Knows his way around an engine.

18:37.653 --> 18:39.921
Sure, I can take a look.

18:47.963 --> 18:50.098
I don't see anything offhand.

18:51.400 --> 18:52.865
Muffin?

18:56.138 --> 18:59.107
Could you please not refer
to me as a breakfast pastry?

18:59.141 --> 19:00.642
Come here for a second.

19:00.676 --> 19:01.943
What?

19:02.124 --> 19:03.545
Smell that?

19:04.364 --> 19:05.559
Yeah.

19:12.885 --> 19:14.589
The fuel line's been cut.

19:15.012 --> 19:16.591
Looks like with a knife.

19:16.625 --> 19:18.182
This is sabotage.

19:18.207 --> 19:20.709
Whoever killed Bert does not
want us to leave.

19:54.988 --> 19:56.889
God, this place is so beautiful.

20:02.362 --> 20:03.436
What?

20:04.330 --> 20:06.147
I'm just really impressed.

20:07.116 --> 20:08.534
I remember when you enlisted,

20:08.568 --> 20:10.358
you always wanted to learn how to fly.

20:10.382 --> 20:11.648
Was always a dream of mine.

20:11.683 --> 20:12.816
Since you were a kid.

20:12.851 --> 20:13.917
I know.

20:13.952 --> 20:15.919
Now I'm doing it.

20:15.954 --> 20:18.088
In a place people dream about.

20:18.123 --> 20:19.857
I'm so proud of you.

20:25.099 --> 20:26.930
You know, when I first went up,

20:26.965 --> 20:28.499
I didn't think I could do it.

20:28.533 --> 20:29.833
I almost bailed.

20:29.868 --> 20:31.001
What changed your mind?

20:31.797 --> 20:33.504
Well, you did.

20:36.040 --> 20:38.008
You always believed in me.

20:38.042 --> 20:39.977
That got me through it.

20:40.514 --> 20:42.613
It got me through a lot of things.

20:50.021 --> 20:51.522
Want to give it a try?

20:52.924 --> 20:54.057
Seriously?

20:54.092 --> 20:55.893
Yeah.

20:55.927 --> 20:58.407
Just hold the cyclic like that.

20:59.030 --> 21:01.565
- All right.
- I'm doing it!

21:07.005 --> 21:08.459
Wow.

21:17.582 --> 21:19.917
Whoever killed
Bert wants to delay the police.

21:19.951 --> 21:21.652
Yeah. Increases the chances

21:21.686 --> 21:24.021
that whatever forensic evidence
might implicate them degrades

21:24.055 --> 21:26.352
before CSU has time to get there.

21:27.959 --> 21:29.554
- What's the latest with the bus?
- Yeah, is it fixable?

21:29.589 --> 21:31.094
All we know is, it won't run.

21:31.129 --> 21:32.863
So we're stuck here?

21:32.897 --> 21:34.304
Come on, we'll hike back
to that gas station

21:34.338 --> 21:35.279
we passed on our way here.

21:35.304 --> 21:37.000
No, hold on, you guys can't leave.

21:37.035 --> 21:38.068
- Why not?
- Nobody can.

21:38.102 --> 21:40.003
Why? There's nothing we can do for Bert.

21:40.038 --> 21:42.739
Stan's gonna hike back while
the rest of us stay here.

21:42.774 --> 21:44.741
It's a liability issue, right, Stan?

21:44.776 --> 21:46.877
All the passengers need to stay
here for their own safety.

21:46.911 --> 21:48.946
Uh, not sure. Haven't been
in this situation before,

21:48.980 --> 21:50.050
but that sounds right.

21:50.085 --> 21:52.015
A passenger died and our bus broke down.

21:52.050 --> 21:54.051
Tour's over. Come on, we're out of here.

21:56.621 --> 21:59.478
Listen, Bert's death wasn't an accident.

21:59.513 --> 22:00.657
What do you mean?

22:02.093 --> 22:03.927
He didn't simply fall off a cliff.

22:03.962 --> 22:06.530
Are you saying it was like a suicide?

22:06.564 --> 22:07.865
Bert was murdered.

22:08.727 --> 22:11.444
And since we're all
possible witnesses here,

22:11.478 --> 22:13.203
we can't leave until the cops get here.

22:13.238 --> 22:15.038
You said he fell.

22:15.073 --> 22:17.107
I know. I'm-I'm so sorry, Gladys,

22:17.141 --> 22:19.743
but we couldn't afford to panic everyone.

22:19.777 --> 22:22.045
So someone here killed Bert?

22:22.080 --> 22:23.814
Hold up.

22:23.848 --> 22:24.948
If one of us is a killer,

22:24.983 --> 22:27.251
- that's even more reason to bounce.
- Okay, you do that,

22:27.285 --> 22:28.986
you go straight to the
top of the suspect list.

22:29.020 --> 22:31.588
Suspect list? Who the hell are you?

22:31.959 --> 22:34.211
Private investigator.
This is my partner Juliet.

22:34.245 --> 22:35.592
And since we've already eliminated Stan

22:35.627 --> 22:38.095
as a suspect, he's gonna head off on foot

22:38.129 --> 22:39.466
until he finds some cell signal.

22:39.501 --> 22:42.663
This is the direct number to
Detective Gordon Katsumoto

22:42.698 --> 22:43.725
of HPD.

22:43.760 --> 22:45.068
Okay, the rest of us

22:45.103 --> 22:47.504
just need to stay here
until the police arrive.

22:47.539 --> 22:48.672
Stay here?

22:48.706 --> 22:50.073
With the killer?

22:50.108 --> 22:52.075
- There's safety in numbers.
- I'm sorry,

22:52.110 --> 22:53.577
but who put you two in charge?

22:53.611 --> 22:54.752
The way I see it,
they're the closest thing

22:54.787 --> 22:55.812
we've got to the cops.

22:55.847 --> 22:57.581
I agree. Maybe they should take

22:57.615 --> 22:58.916
the lead until the police arrive.

22:58.950 --> 23:00.083
Makes sense to me.

23:00.118 --> 23:02.332
Stan. You should probably get going.

23:02.367 --> 23:03.820
What, so we're just supposed to wait?

23:03.855 --> 23:05.789
No. Actually, we have work to do.

23:05.823 --> 23:06.990
The first thing we should do is

23:07.025 --> 23:08.191
protect Bert's body from the elements,

23:08.226 --> 23:09.293
especially the heat.

23:09.327 --> 23:11.261
So, how exactly do we do that?

23:11.296 --> 23:12.996
We're gonna need to recover the body

23:13.031 --> 23:14.965
and, and put it somewhere cooler.

23:14.999 --> 23:17.034
Look, I-I know obviously
nobody signed up for this,

23:17.068 --> 23:18.635
but we're gonna have to pull together

23:18.670 --> 23:20.003
and get this done quickly.

23:20.038 --> 23:21.304
Okay, but how are we gonna raise him up?

23:21.339 --> 23:23.140
I mean, you saw how far down he is.

23:23.174 --> 23:24.675
We could rig a stretcher.

23:24.709 --> 23:26.276
I-I was an Eagle Scout.

23:26.311 --> 23:27.611
Earned my Wilderness Survival merit badge

23:27.645 --> 23:28.612
transporting a brother scout

23:28.646 --> 23:30.427
with a broken leg through
two miles of forest.

23:30.462 --> 23:33.145
Great. Dylan will take point.

23:35.866 --> 23:37.734
Lay it all down here.

23:37.759 --> 23:39.627
Okay, now we need some umbrellas.

23:44.722 --> 23:46.056
We can use this as twine.

23:47.905 --> 23:49.105
The sturdier, the better.

24:04.916 --> 24:06.583
You're quite handy.

24:06.618 --> 24:09.586
Thanks. We're gonna need
a few more blankets.

24:09.621 --> 24:11.221
Oh, I know where they are.

24:13.191 --> 24:15.688
We're grateful to you
and your girlfriend for helping.

24:15.713 --> 24:18.315
Appreciate that, but...
she's not my girlfriend.

24:18.522 --> 24:19.923
At least not yet.

24:20.031 --> 24:21.264
We basically just met.

24:21.299 --> 24:23.333
It's only our... second date?

24:23.368 --> 24:24.512
Oh. How did you meet?

24:24.546 --> 24:26.203
Same as everyone: an app.

24:28.211 --> 24:29.512
Of course.

24:32.950 --> 24:34.917
What are you doing?
We may need that food.

24:34.942 --> 24:37.228
It's hot. Best way to preserve evidence

24:37.253 --> 24:38.868
is by putting Bert's body on ice.

24:38.893 --> 24:40.727
That's creepy.

24:40.752 --> 24:41.985
But cool, too.

24:42.220 --> 24:43.387
Hey.

24:43.421 --> 24:44.428
Stretcher's ready.

24:44.462 --> 24:46.056
You think you can finish the job?

24:46.090 --> 24:47.124
On it.

24:47.158 --> 24:48.225
Great.

24:48.554 --> 24:49.726
Gladys, you all right?

24:49.761 --> 24:51.098
I want to help.

24:52.463 --> 24:53.663
You sure?

24:54.265 --> 24:55.644
Yeah.

24:57.896 --> 24:59.770
Well, then, of course you're welcome.

24:59.804 --> 25:01.692
Thank you.

25:10.915 --> 25:13.083
Listen, I know Krista's husband
must have hired you

25:13.117 --> 25:15.419
to see if she and I are, you know...

25:15.453 --> 25:16.620
Cheating on your spouses?

25:16.654 --> 25:17.954
Yeah, that.

25:17.989 --> 25:20.357
I was hoping that
you wouldn't say anything.

25:21.459 --> 25:23.427
Come on, man, look, when this is over,

25:23.461 --> 25:25.429
whatever he's paying you, I'll double it.

25:25.463 --> 25:27.222
You really think now is the
time to talk about this?

25:27.256 --> 25:29.803
There's a dead man, and we
have a lot of work to do.

25:30.750 --> 25:32.903
Please. I don't want to lose everything.

25:32.937 --> 25:34.771
You think I haven't heard this before?

25:34.806 --> 25:36.543
You guys are all the same.

25:36.578 --> 25:38.942
Whatever you have to say,
I don't want to hear it.

25:38.976 --> 25:41.445
The only thing you should be
thinking about is losing your wife,

25:41.479 --> 25:43.213
cheating on her, okay?

25:44.148 --> 25:46.383
Thanks for nothing.

25:49.406 --> 25:50.821
Well said.

25:50.855 --> 25:52.122
He needed to hear it.

25:52.156 --> 25:53.757
Gladys?

25:53.791 --> 25:55.759
You all right?

25:55.793 --> 25:57.994
Yeah. I just can't catch my breath.

25:58.029 --> 25:59.896
Okay, just take a minute.

26:00.998 --> 26:02.332
Better?

26:05.136 --> 26:06.185
I don't know why this...

26:06.220 --> 26:08.004
this isn't working.

26:08.039 --> 26:09.172
It's not working?

26:09.207 --> 26:10.841
Oh, dear.

26:10.875 --> 26:11.975
It's empty.

26:12.009 --> 26:14.845
I don't understand it... I
just picked it up yesterday.

26:14.879 --> 26:16.947
- You picked it up yesterday?
- Uh-huh.

26:17.690 --> 26:20.183
Okay, well, just wait here
and-and catch your breath

26:20.218 --> 26:22.085
for a minute... I'll be back.

26:25.356 --> 26:28.024
- Everything okay?
- Her asthma's flaring up.

26:28.059 --> 26:30.994
She told me that the inhaler that
she bought yesterday is already empty.

26:31.028 --> 26:32.295
I don't think that's a coincidence.

26:32.330 --> 26:34.362
And you think the killer
had something to do with that?

26:34.396 --> 26:37.067
Well, maybe the killer was
using her inhaler

26:37.101 --> 26:39.870
as a way to separate Bert and
Gladys, get Bert on his own.

26:40.374 --> 26:41.972
If you're right, this was planned

26:42.006 --> 26:43.707
well in advance, which means...

26:43.741 --> 26:46.276
That Bert's murder was premeditated.

27:02.794 --> 27:06.229
Find some place
that makes you feel better.

27:06.264 --> 27:09.065
Use it when you got the blues.

27:09.100 --> 27:11.414
Well, I can see why you chose this place.

27:12.804 --> 27:14.199
Yeah.

27:15.039 --> 27:16.450
This place...

27:16.484 --> 27:18.508
makes God undeniable.

27:30.121 --> 27:31.988
I'm so sorry.

27:33.469 --> 27:35.091
Teresa, you don't have to...

27:35.126 --> 27:36.138
No, I do.

27:37.539 --> 27:39.763
When you were captured,
I thought you were dead.

27:39.797 --> 27:41.932
Everybody did for months.

27:42.436 --> 27:44.568
I-I-I was paralyzed.

27:46.070 --> 27:47.608
I couldn't breathe.

27:48.439 --> 27:52.108
My mom told me I had to,
had to get up, keep moving,

27:52.404 --> 27:53.697
but I couldn't.

27:54.990 --> 27:56.413
My heart was shattered.

27:57.701 --> 27:58.982
And then, when we found out

27:59.016 --> 28:00.317
you were alive, I-I-I hated myself

28:00.351 --> 28:02.052
for trying to move on.

28:02.086 --> 28:03.587
Like, how could I do that?

28:07.491 --> 28:09.893
Then you never reached out.

28:11.128 --> 28:12.758
You didn't come home.

28:18.836 --> 28:20.516
My heart broke all over again.

28:28.145 --> 28:29.691
I'm sorry, T.

28:30.281 --> 28:31.485
It wasn't...

28:32.361 --> 28:33.984
Look, when I got out, Pops told me

28:34.018 --> 28:35.352
that you found someone else.

28:35.386 --> 28:37.449
It would've hurt too much to come home.

28:39.451 --> 28:41.995
That's one of the reasons I moved here.

28:45.207 --> 28:46.750
I needed to start over.

28:48.199 --> 28:49.836
I thought you stopped loving me.

28:51.755 --> 28:53.103
Never.

28:55.717 --> 28:57.107
Look at me.

28:58.376 --> 29:01.515
What I'm feeling right now, it
feels like we were never apart.

29:02.213 --> 29:05.282
And I just, I can't help
but keep thinking that...

29:05.602 --> 29:07.150
maybe this is all meant to be.

29:07.184 --> 29:09.519
You know, like, maybe this
is all just some big sign.

29:12.556 --> 29:14.611
I never stopped loving you.

29:59.136 --> 30:00.616
Is someone down there?

30:04.608 --> 30:05.909
- Is that...?
- Eddie?

30:05.943 --> 30:07.410
What the hell's he doing?

30:07.651 --> 30:08.851
Hey!

30:31.407 --> 30:33.375
You broke my ribs!

30:33.409 --> 30:35.498
Yeah? And you killed Bert.

30:35.533 --> 30:36.585
I didn't kill anybody.

30:36.610 --> 30:37.679
We need something to tie him up with.

30:37.944 --> 30:39.314
Give me your shirt?

30:44.954 --> 30:47.422
- Here. This might make it easier.
- I told you,

30:47.456 --> 30:48.723
you guys got the wrong idea.

30:48.758 --> 30:50.425
Really? Because from where we stood,

30:50.459 --> 30:51.926
you were tampering with
evidence, which is something

30:51.961 --> 30:53.828
only Bert's killer
would have reason to do.

30:53.863 --> 30:55.163
Tampering with evidence? No.

30:55.197 --> 30:56.998
What were you doing
crouched over Bert's body?

30:58.534 --> 30:59.668
Exactly.

30:59.702 --> 31:00.869
Just look in my pocket.

31:01.737 --> 31:03.053
The other one.

31:08.016 --> 31:09.377
This is Bert's.

31:09.412 --> 31:11.046
- You stole it?
- Yeah.

31:11.080 --> 31:12.280
Why? You're rich.

31:12.314 --> 31:14.783
Maybe he is, and maybe he just
wants people to think he is.

31:14.817 --> 31:17.352
She's right. I'm broke.

31:17.386 --> 31:18.620
Let me guess.

31:18.654 --> 31:20.455
Your girlfriend has no idea.

31:20.489 --> 31:22.357
Paula thinks I'm loaded.

31:22.391 --> 31:23.591
You're a real scumbag, you know that?

31:23.626 --> 31:26.628
Well, maybe, but that watch
is worth, like, 25 grand, easy.

31:26.662 --> 31:28.463
It's not like he needed it anymore.

31:28.497 --> 31:30.465
You're gonna justify
bloody grave-robbing?

31:30.499 --> 31:31.633
Well, at least I ain't a killer.

31:32.980 --> 31:34.502
I buy his story.

31:34.537 --> 31:37.105
Why kill Bert
and come back for the watch?

31:37.139 --> 31:39.374
Thank you. Now will you get off me?

31:41.510 --> 31:42.676
Give me that knife.

31:44.302 --> 31:45.580
Smells like gasoline.

31:46.849 --> 31:48.817
I-I don't understand. It smells like gas?

31:48.851 --> 31:51.052
Can you explain why?
That's your knife, right?

31:51.087 --> 31:52.987
Yeah, but I... but I got it from Sandy.

31:53.022 --> 31:55.457
She said it was her father's
and that he would want her

31:55.491 --> 31:57.530
to give it to someone like me,
a real Boy Scout.

31:57.564 --> 31:59.060
On your second date?

31:59.095 --> 32:01.830
Were you with Sandy
during the whole picnic?

32:01.864 --> 32:04.240
Well, not the whole time. We split
up at one point to use the bathroom.

32:04.264 --> 32:05.258
And when'd she give it to you?

32:05.283 --> 32:06.831
Right before this last stop.

32:06.866 --> 32:08.900
Okay, so Sandy cut the fuel line
on an earlier stop

32:08.934 --> 32:11.369
and then handed over the
incriminating evidence to Dylan.

32:11.403 --> 32:13.605
And then killed Bert while
you two were separated.

32:13.639 --> 32:15.240
What, what? N-No. That-that can't be.

32:15.274 --> 32:16.281
Sandy is not a killer.

32:16.315 --> 32:17.876
Well, that's certainly how it looks.

32:17.910 --> 32:19.911
What? I... I don't get it.

32:19.945 --> 32:21.513
Why would she do this?

32:21.547 --> 32:23.592
Don't know, but we got to find her.

32:27.349 --> 32:28.882
Never should've happened.

32:28.916 --> 32:30.922
Yeah, you said that,
like, four times already.

32:30.956 --> 32:33.258
Yeah, I mean, I was at my spot,

32:33.292 --> 32:35.593
we were looking at
paradise, and it was so...

32:35.628 --> 32:37.128
Romantic.

32:38.264 --> 32:39.464
We just couldn't...

32:39.498 --> 32:40.932
You had a moment.

32:41.193 --> 32:42.534
I can't believe this.

32:42.568 --> 32:44.235
I mean, what was I doing?

32:44.270 --> 32:45.352
She's married.

32:45.386 --> 32:47.205
All right, first of all,

32:47.239 --> 32:48.640
you cannot put this on yourself.

32:48.674 --> 32:50.204
There were two of you.

32:50.239 --> 32:52.143
And second of all, it was just a kiss.

32:52.177 --> 32:53.244
It's not a big deal.

32:53.279 --> 32:55.647
Yeah, but it was a big deal. It's huge.

32:55.681 --> 32:56.892
Why?

32:57.816 --> 32:59.617
'Cause I was feeling something.

32:59.652 --> 33:02.387
Something I haven't felt
in a very long time.

33:02.421 --> 33:03.588
- Yeah.
- We both were.

33:03.924 --> 33:05.823
Maybe this is fate.

33:06.259 --> 33:08.459
Maybe the two of you were meant
to be together.

33:08.494 --> 33:10.562
Yeah, well, fate don't happen
on somebody's honeymoon.

33:10.596 --> 33:12.430
It doesn't give a damn when it happens.

33:12.464 --> 33:15.233
You and I both know love doesn't
come along every day.

33:16.603 --> 33:18.336
What are the odds, man?

33:18.370 --> 33:21.739
Of all the gin joints on the
island, she walked into ours?

33:24.820 --> 33:26.377
So what are you gonna do?

33:30.268 --> 33:31.834
We almost got it, guys.

33:31.859 --> 33:34.162
Just a little bit further.

33:35.821 --> 33:37.457
Keep pulling!

33:40.752 --> 33:42.193
One more!

33:42.227 --> 33:43.995
That's it. Come on, everyone.

33:44.029 --> 33:46.264
Here-here we go.

33:47.900 --> 33:49.000
Oh, my.

33:53.238 --> 33:55.306
Anybody see Sandy?

33:55.341 --> 33:57.675
It's a good question.
She was here before.

33:57.710 --> 33:59.978
Okay, well, she obviously snuck
off while no one was watching.

34:00.012 --> 34:02.738
We'll find her. In the
meantime we should help him get the body

34:02.773 --> 34:03.863
back to the bus.

34:03.898 --> 34:05.350
All right. You guys ready?

34:05.384 --> 34:07.986
One, two, three.

34:25.704 --> 34:27.038
Everyone safe?

34:27.072 --> 34:29.174
Yeah, but it appears our killer got away.

34:29.208 --> 34:30.808
She goes by the name Sandy Maron,

34:30.842 --> 34:32.010
but we think it's an alias.

34:32.277 --> 34:33.744
Show him the picture of her.

34:36.281 --> 34:38.583
You know why she killed the victim?

34:38.617 --> 34:40.918
No, but it was premeditated,
so we think it could be a hit.

34:40.953 --> 34:42.587
I could issue a BOLO, but if she's a pro,

34:42.621 --> 34:44.025
she'll have worked out an exfil
beforehand.

34:44.060 --> 34:45.757
Yeah, perhaps, but she might
have left some digital clues

34:45.791 --> 34:46.924
that'll help us find her.

34:46.958 --> 34:49.927
- What makes you think that?
- Dylan here

34:49.962 --> 34:51.362
met her on a dating app.

34:59.289 --> 35:00.571
You getting anything

35:00.606 --> 35:02.578
from that dating profile
that can help us find her?

35:02.613 --> 35:04.542
All of Sandy's online profile photos

35:04.576 --> 35:06.844
appear to have been taken recently,
like in the last week.

35:06.879 --> 35:08.798
She must have slapped it together

35:08.823 --> 35:10.014
to get a date on that love bus.

35:10.049 --> 35:12.052
We know where those photos were taken?

35:13.261 --> 35:15.553
No, but I can geotrack them.

35:24.981 --> 35:26.564
The Alohilani Hotel.

35:26.598 --> 35:27.933
She's probably staying there.

35:27.967 --> 35:29.534
She's probably on her way there now.

35:29.568 --> 35:30.802
Okay, you better step on it.

35:44.503 --> 35:46.838
Detective Katsumoto, HPD.
Looking for a guest.

35:46.872 --> 35:49.240
May have checked in under
the name Sandy Maron.

35:49.274 --> 35:52.010
I'm sorry, uh, that name's not coming up.

35:52.044 --> 35:53.277
Here's a picture of her.

35:56.262 --> 35:57.515
Oh, yeah.

35:57.549 --> 35:59.751
She's staying under the name Hollis.

35:59.785 --> 36:01.919
Came through the lobby earlier,
took the elevator up.

36:01.954 --> 36:03.855
- When was this?
- Uh, maybe five minutes ago?

36:03.889 --> 36:04.989
What's the room number?

36:05.024 --> 36:07.492
- 1023.
- Thank you.

36:07.526 --> 36:08.817
Wait here.

36:18.837 --> 36:19.971
Gordon.

36:20.005 --> 36:21.472
She headed down the emergency stairs.

36:21.507 --> 36:22.622
Try to cut her off.

37:31.390 --> 37:32.823
Let me see your hands!

37:43.222 --> 37:44.621
Don't even think about it.

38:00.912 --> 38:02.312
Shot through the heart.

38:02.337 --> 38:04.404
How apropos.

38:20.359 --> 38:21.492
We got into Sandy's phone.

38:21.527 --> 38:23.060
You guys were right.

38:23.095 --> 38:24.962
She was hired to kill Bert.

38:24.997 --> 38:27.632
But... who could possibly
have wanted him dead?

38:27.666 --> 38:29.467
His business partner,

38:29.501 --> 38:31.469
who also happened to be
his ex-brother-in-law.

38:31.918 --> 38:35.339
Bert left his first wife after
finding true love with Gladys.

38:35.374 --> 38:38.276
So his business partner wanted revenge

38:38.310 --> 38:39.510
for his sister's broken heart?

38:39.545 --> 38:40.611
Looks that way.

38:40.646 --> 38:43.247
Lives in Tampa, Florida.
Local PD is bringing him in.

38:43.282 --> 38:45.650
You see that? Online
dating is not for me,

38:45.684 --> 38:47.585
but works out sometimes.

38:47.619 --> 38:49.420
How do you figure in this instance?

38:49.454 --> 38:51.255
Helped us catch a killer.

38:51.290 --> 38:53.357
Okay, but it also helped a hit woman

38:53.392 --> 38:55.359
complete her assignment.

38:55.394 --> 38:56.928
It's a valid point.

38:56.962 --> 38:59.664
So, can we call this argument
a draw from here on out?

38:59.698 --> 39:01.432
It doesn't matter how we find it.

39:01.466 --> 39:02.967
We've all known great loves,

39:03.001 --> 39:05.436
and, uh... we've all lost 'em.

39:05.470 --> 39:06.470
- True.
- Been there.

39:06.505 --> 39:07.829
Ditto.

39:10.409 --> 39:12.376
Uh, but on the bright side,

39:12.411 --> 39:14.278
you know, we all have each other,

39:14.313 --> 39:16.480
and I got to say,
that's pretty damn good.

39:16.754 --> 39:18.555
I'll drink to that.

39:20.152 --> 39:22.286
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

39:22.321 --> 39:23.487
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

39:45.577 --> 39:47.478
I'm glad you called.

39:49.837 --> 39:51.782
- Teresa...
- I'm gonna leave Andy.

39:54.753 --> 39:56.554
Tell me.

39:56.588 --> 39:59.390
Please tell me he's a bad guy.

39:59.424 --> 40:01.259
He's mean, violent,

40:01.716 --> 40:03.494
don't love his mama, something.

40:03.528 --> 40:05.529
I know what you're trying to do here,

40:05.564 --> 40:07.164
but I can't do that.

40:07.680 --> 40:09.233
Andy's a good man.

40:11.203 --> 40:13.371
And I was really happy.

40:13.686 --> 40:15.706
Until I saw you, and...

40:15.741 --> 40:18.483
and I remembered what it was
like to be even happier.

40:26.074 --> 40:29.387
Then you got to pretend
that today never happened.

40:30.622 --> 40:34.458
Look, I still love you more
than I ever loved anybody, T.

40:34.916 --> 40:38.462
But you vowed to spend the rest
of your life with a good man.

40:39.212 --> 40:41.365
I don't want to ruin that.

40:41.400 --> 40:45.069
Not for you, not for him.

40:45.603 --> 40:47.838
But mostly not for me.

40:50.575 --> 40:52.510
That ain't the man I want to be.

40:54.037 --> 40:55.603
It just ain't right.

40:58.230 --> 41:00.331
Should have expected this.

41:02.321 --> 41:04.755
You've got this giant heart.

41:07.222 --> 41:09.560
The way you care about other people,

41:09.594 --> 41:12.120
the way you wouldn't want
to hurt even a stranger.

41:14.733 --> 41:17.535
It's why I fell in love
with you in the first place.

41:21.173 --> 41:23.381
Hey.

41:24.209 --> 41:25.543
It's okay.

41:28.680 --> 41:30.748
This one's goodbye.

41:52.571 --> 41:54.638
Have a happy life, Teresa.

41:57.181 --> 41:59.167
You, too, Theodore.
