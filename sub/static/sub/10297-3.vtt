You want
another burger, Al?

01:19.033 --> 01:20.701
They're almost finished.

01:26.868 --> 01:29.901
You made 'em
just like I like 'em.

01:29.901 --> 01:31.200
Dark.

01:33.000 --> 01:34.000
There you go, honey.

01:34.000 --> 01:36.167
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

01:42.801 --> 01:44.100
Well...

01:44.100 --> 01:45.367
Urp!

01:45.367 --> 01:47.167
I'm full.

01:47.167 --> 01:50.300
Okay, honey, now it's time
to do your chores.

01:50.300 --> 01:53.901
Wait a second, Peg.
We had sex three nights ago.

01:53.901 --> 01:56.601
I'm still kind of woozy.

01:56.601 --> 01:57.868
The garbage, Al.

01:57.868 --> 02:01.968
The longer
of the two jobs.

02:01.968 --> 02:04.534
And the more rewarding.

02:09.133 --> 02:11.367
Don't you even know
how to do that?

02:11.367 --> 02:13.901
Aw, thanks, Peg.
Now it's exactly like sex.

02:18.434 --> 02:20.434
I can't believe it.

02:20.434 --> 02:21.734
I failed.

02:21.734 --> 02:24.100
Which class was it this time?

02:24.100 --> 02:26.667
Oh, Daddy,
I'm not talking about school.

02:26.667 --> 02:29.000
Why would I care about that?

02:29.000 --> 02:33.234
Mom, I flirted with a boy,
and he paid no attention to me.

02:33.234 --> 02:34.901
Oh, honey.

02:38.467 --> 02:40.000
Well, you can't give up.

02:40.000 --> 02:42.000
You've gotta
keep on trying.

02:42.000 --> 02:43.400
Well, there's nowhere left to go

02:43.400 --> 02:45.200
once you've stood
in the boys' shower,

02:45.200 --> 02:47.434
wearing a sign
that says "soap."

02:49.367 --> 02:51.834
Hey, I play for keeps.

02:52.968 --> 02:54.267
It's unbelievable.

02:54.267 --> 02:56.267
Every time I've wanted a guy,
I've gotten him.

02:56.267 --> 02:58.267
I mean, I'm famous for it,

02:58.267 --> 02:59.868
but this guy won't even
look at me.

02:59.868 --> 03:01.167
Mom, you've got to help me.

03:01.167 --> 03:02.968
What did you do
in school to get guys?

03:02.968 --> 03:06.701
Same thing she does now
to chase them away.

03:06.701 --> 03:08.601
Daddy, we're talking.

03:08.601 --> 03:10.934
Just clean up the garbage, Al.

03:10.934 --> 03:12.601
Oh, God.

03:14.400 --> 03:15.634
Well, Kelly,

03:15.634 --> 03:16.734
a good place to start

03:16.734 --> 03:19.033
is to pretend that you have
a common interest.

03:19.033 --> 03:21.400
Now, what does this guy like?

03:21.400 --> 03:23.100
Football.

03:23.100 --> 03:25.334
Everyone wants
a football player.

03:25.334 --> 03:27.033
I played football.

03:27.033 --> 03:30.033
You know, football players
aren't very bright,

03:30.033 --> 03:32.067
and they usually wind up
doing menial jobs

03:32.067 --> 03:34.167
for minimum wage,

03:34.167 --> 03:37.167
desperately clinging
to their former glory.

03:37.167 --> 03:40.367
Yep, yep. They called me
Touchdown Bundy.

03:40.367 --> 03:43.300
Yeah, I was great.

03:43.300 --> 03:45.400
Mom, I have never failed
at getting a guy.

03:45.400 --> 03:47.467
I mean, once that goes,
I'm nothing.

03:47.467 --> 03:49.033
No, Kel.

03:49.033 --> 03:51.033
Once the lips
stop saying, "Yes,"

03:51.033 --> 03:52.734
and the eyes
stop saying, "Duh,"

03:52.734 --> 03:55.133
then you're nothing.

03:55.133 --> 03:58.167
If only it was
as easy for me

03:58.167 --> 03:59.834
as it is for Bud.

03:59.834 --> 04:01.234
A <i>Penthouse,</i>
a night light,

04:01.234 --> 04:02.968
and a pillow
named Shirley.

04:06.534 --> 04:09.968
One problem at a time, kids.

04:09.968 --> 04:13.067
Now, Kelly, here's what
I think you're doing wrong.

04:13.067 --> 04:15.000
Stop flirting with this boy
at school.

04:15.000 --> 04:17.300
Get him alone
with no distractions.

04:17.300 --> 04:20.634
Get him to tell you all
his secret dreams and hopes,

04:20.634 --> 04:25.300
and then use them
to crush him.

04:25.300 --> 04:29.067
The important thing is
to go after what you want.

04:29.067 --> 04:31.601
I did.

04:31.601 --> 04:34.067
AL: Peg, I stepped
in the garbage can,

04:34.067 --> 04:35.701
and I can't get out!

04:38.234 --> 04:40.567
I'll be right there, Al!

04:40.567 --> 04:43.934
Just be sure it really <i>is</i>
what you want.

04:46.267 --> 04:49.467
Hey, no-life,
I need a favor.

04:49.467 --> 04:51.300
I want you help me
get this guy.

04:51.300 --> 04:52.400
What's wrong,

04:52.400 --> 04:55.601
the breakaway blouse
isn't working?

04:55.601 --> 04:59.801
Hey, I'm asking you nice,
you little eunuch.

04:59.801 --> 05:01.167
Anyway, I have an idea.

05:01.167 --> 05:02.634
I checked up on this guy,

05:02.634 --> 05:05.033
and I know he's not doing
too good in English.

05:05.033 --> 05:06.801
"Well," Kelly.

05:06.801 --> 05:09.501
Well what?

05:09.501 --> 05:10.968
[SIGHS]

05:13.234 --> 05:16.567
Okay. So he ain't done
no good in English.

05:16.567 --> 05:17.634
So what?

05:20.000 --> 05:21.934
Okay, once again.

05:21.934 --> 05:24.467
In <i>Of Mice And Men,</i>
the big one was...

05:24.467 --> 05:25.467
Lenny.

05:25.467 --> 05:26.968
Very good.

05:26.968 --> 05:28.167
And the little one was...

05:29.501 --> 05:31.200
Squiggy?

05:33.868 --> 05:37.234
Good. Good.

05:37.234 --> 05:40.501
Now that we've, uh,
conquered literature,

05:40.501 --> 05:41.868
let's move on to spelling.

Okay, I think it's time
for a break.

05:52.467 --> 05:53.667
Now, listen, Matt.

05:53.667 --> 05:55.701
You just stay here
and run the alphabet

05:55.701 --> 05:57.367

I'm Kelly.

06:05.067 --> 06:08.868
Remember? We met in
the boys' shower the other day?

06:08.868 --> 06:12.701
Oh, yeah. The soup girl.

06:12.701 --> 06:16.200
The soap girl.

06:16.200 --> 06:17.534

06:24.467 --> 06:25.601
You're a football player.

06:25.601 --> 06:27.501
I have a football
question for you.

06:29.334 --> 06:33.434
I get cramps
in my leg right here.

06:33.434 --> 06:35.701
Do you think
you could get that out?

06:35.701 --> 06:39.000
Well, it may take some time,
but I'll do what I can.

06:40.634 --> 06:43.133
Uh, hi, Dad.

06:43.133 --> 06:45.667
Dad, I'm Kelly,
and this is Matt.

06:45.667 --> 06:48.200
I'd like you to meet us.

06:48.200 --> 06:52.501
Nice to meet you, Kelly.

06:52.501 --> 06:55.400
So, uh, you're
the football player, huh?

06:55.400 --> 06:56.968
You know, I used
to play football.

06:56.968 --> 06:59.300
You remember
the Panthers of '66?

06:59.300 --> 07:02.701
Yeah, they were the last
championship team at our school.

07:02.701 --> 07:03.934
Daddy...

07:03.934 --> 07:05.767
AL:
Later, Kelly.

07:05.767 --> 07:07.567
You know who the fullback was
on that team?

07:07.567 --> 07:08.567
Take a guess.

07:08.567 --> 07:10.934
Red Grange?

07:10.934 --> 07:12.901
Well, close.

07:12.901 --> 07:14.167

07:14.167 --> 07:15.634
You're Red Grange?

07:15.634 --> 07:17.868
Pleased to meet you, sir.

07:17.868 --> 07:19.634
Uh, I'm pleased to meet you too,

07:19.634 --> 07:24.100

by my nickname, Al Bundy.

07:24.100 --> 07:25.367

07:25.367 --> 07:26.767
So, what position
do you play, son?

07:26.767 --> 07:27.934
Fullback.
Yeah?

07:27.934 --> 07:30.200
Well, we went both ways
in our day.

07:30.200 --> 07:32.300
Well, now a lot of
the guys on the team

07:32.300 --> 07:33.734

07:33.734 --> 07:35.000
Not me, though.

07:35.000 --> 07:38.367

07:38.367 --> 07:40.601
Ahem. Ahem.

07:40.601 --> 07:42.868
Kelly, you want to take
something for that?

07:42.868 --> 07:45.934
Anyhow, yeah, we were
really great back then. Yep.

07:45.934 --> 07:48.067
Only team in Polk history
to go undefeated.

07:48.067 --> 07:50.100
Now, that's something
that'll never happen again.

07:50.100 --> 07:51.567
We're undefeated too.

07:51.567 --> 07:54.601
Hmm? Well, h-how many games
you got left?

07:54.601 --> 07:56.534
One. This Saturday.

07:56.534 --> 07:58.400
You really ought to
come see your record

07:58.400 --> 08:00.467
go down the drain,
Mr. Grange.

08:00.467 --> 08:01.868
I can get you good seats.

08:01.868 --> 08:04.968
Did I tell you
that I hold the school record

08:04.968 --> 08:06.601
for touchdowns in a season?

08:06.601 --> 08:07.934
That's amazing.

08:07.934 --> 08:10.434
I'm one touchdown away from
breaking that record too.

go out there

some of your moves?

at it later, Kathy.

08:34.933 --> 08:39.501

I'm a little rusty.

I dropped a quarter.

this one guy?

is sports,
