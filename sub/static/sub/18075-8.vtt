00:01.000 --> 00:03.888
[Man]
Ten years ago, a crack commando unit
was sent to prison by a military court...

00:03.977 --> 00:05.887
for a crime they didn"t commit.

00:05.980 --> 00:10.559
These men promptly escaped
from a maximum-security stockade
to the Los Angeles underground.

00:10.652 --> 00:14.781
Today, still wanted by the government,
they survive as soldiers of fortune.

00:14.865 --> 00:18.401
If you have a problem, if no one else
can help, and if you can find them...

00:18.495 --> 00:20.535
maybe you can hire... the A-Team.

01:59.111 --> 02:02.421
There you go, mister.
Better than if you bought a new pair.

02:02.574 --> 02:04.780
Hey, Nicky, it's getting late.

02:04.868 --> 02:07.324
You better be getting home
before it gets dark, huh?

02:07.413 --> 02:11.707
Yeah, sure, but didn't you want me
to help you bring up some cartons
from the storeroom?

02:11.793 --> 02:13.073
Oh, no.

02:13.920 --> 02:15.997
No, not now.
Tomorrow, tomorrow.

02:16.089 --> 02:20.135
Go on now. Get.
Get out of here. Go on.

02:34.986 --> 02:38.522
- Hey, kid, are you any good?
- I'm supposed to be getting home.

02:38.616 --> 02:41.154
Come on.
Let's see some service, man.

02:43.371 --> 02:46.538
We told you what would happen
if you call the cops, old man.

02:46.625 --> 02:49.662
- I won't say a word. I promise.
I won't say... I won't.
- I know, I know.

02:49.753 --> 02:52.043
- [Groans]
- Watch what you're doin', punk!

02:55.135 --> 02:57.128
Mr Laskey!

03:00.307 --> 03:04.009
- [Groaning]
- Mr Laskey!

03:04.103 --> 03:07.639
Just take it easy, Mr Laskey.
Take it easy.

03:35.348 --> 03:38.018
- [Buzzing]
- Pardon me, sir,
do you have any metallic...

03:38.101 --> 03:42.563
- objects on your person?
- I'll bet this is a first for you.

03:47.153 --> 03:49.063
We'll miss the flight, B.A.

03:49.156 --> 03:51.232
Good, 'cause I don't wanna
do this anyway.

03:51.325 --> 03:53.947
I'm sorry, Hannibal.
I said I'd try, but I just can't.

03:54.036 --> 03:55.946
Now, you said you'd give it a shot.

03:56.039 --> 03:58.791
- You'll learn to love flying.
- Soaring among the clouds!

03:58.875 --> 04:01.627
Soaring, soaring, soar...

04:01.712 --> 04:04.630
- Sorry.
- Now, if you weren't gonna go...

04:04.715 --> 04:07.586
Face could've scammed us a jet,
and Murdock could've flown us.

04:07.677 --> 04:10.963
We're saving 2,500 on expenses. Now,
he booked us on a commercial flight...

04:11.056 --> 04:14.971
- because you said you'd fly
if it wasn't Murdock at the controls.
- You didn't tell me he said that.

04:15.061 --> 04:18.146
You said you'd fly with another pilot,
but not me? You said that?

04:18.231 --> 04:20.983
- Yeah!
- Wise choice.

04:21.067 --> 04:24.687
- [Man On P.A.] Flight 403 to New York
now boarding Gate 12.
- They're boarding.

04:26.991 --> 04:29.565
Here.

04:29.661 --> 04:33.362
- Swallow.
- What are these? I don't take no pills.

04:33.457 --> 04:36.542
Well, they're for air sickness. They're
not prescription. They're off the shelf.

04:36.627 --> 04:38.537
Just a precaution.

04:38.630 --> 04:40.955
You better not be trying
to drug me, Hannibal.

04:41.049 --> 04:44.834
Now, why would I try to drug you
when you've already agreed to fly?

04:44.929 --> 04:47.800
I'm lookin' out for you.

04:47.891 --> 04:49.800
Forget 'em. Get sick.

04:52.688 --> 04:56.733
[Jet Engines Whirring]

05:10.083 --> 05:13.001
- No, no! I ain't goin'!
- B.A., don't be that way.

05:13.086 --> 05:15.210
Whole thing will go by
just like that.

05:15.297 --> 05:18.299
- The flight is six hours, man!
- Once you're up there, it's nothing.

05:18.384 --> 05:20.294
It's the take-off
that's the worst part.

05:20.387 --> 05:22.296
That's when the gas starts
pouring over the wings...

05:22.389 --> 05:24.678
- Murdock!
- and the engine starts to spark,
and the whole thing could just...

05:24.767 --> 05:26.676
Believe me,
we'd never feel that one.

05:28.271 --> 05:30.643
- B.A.!
- Hannibal, you should've drugged him.

05:30.732 --> 05:34.066
Four, three, two, one.

05:35.821 --> 05:38.360
Air sickness pills.

05:38.449 --> 05:42.068
A good leader prepares
for every contingency.

05:44.915 --> 05:46.908
Uh, excuse me.

06:42.190 --> 06:46.769
[Man On P.A.] Flight 122
from Los Angeles now arriving Gate 6.

07:00.586 --> 07:03.374
- You okay, B.A.?
- Yeah, I guess so.

07:03.464 --> 07:05.374
Well, they say these things
make you drowsy...

07:05.467 --> 07:07.875
but I told you not to take
two more over Chicago.

07:07.970 --> 07:13.213
- Over Chicago? Where are we?
- # I dig Manhattan
The Bronx and Staten, ahh ##

07:13.309 --> 07:17.094
- We're in New York?
- You slept like a baby
in his mother's arms.

07:17.189 --> 07:21.139
What you talkin' about?
I don't remember gettin' on no aeroplane
or falling asleep either.

07:21.235 --> 07:23.524
Well, no more of these for you.

07:23.613 --> 07:26.151
I suppose you don't remember that sweet
little thing over there either, huh?

07:26.241 --> 07:29.942
If she had given me her number
and said, "Call me," I'd remember.

07:30.037 --> 07:31.946
Her number?

07:37.546 --> 07:39.503
For a guy who doesn"t like to fly...

07:39.590 --> 07:42.295
you sure did it right.

07:42.385 --> 07:44.793
Man, I still don't remember.

07:47.057 --> 07:49.631
Didn't Face say
he was gonna meet us here?

07:49.727 --> 07:51.636
Yeah, that's what he said.

07:52.730 --> 07:54.639
How was the flight?

07:54.732 --> 07:57.140
Good, I guess.

07:57.235 --> 07:59.987
- You driving?
- When in Rome...

08:00.072 --> 08:02.444
Hannibal said we"re following the gopher
back to its hole on this operation...

08:02.533 --> 08:06.068
so I figure if you"re gonna
tail somebody in New York...

08:06.162 --> 08:08.832
they"ll never suspect a taxi.

08:34.654 --> 08:37.192
Well, this is it.

08:43.289 --> 08:45.614
What do you think?

08:45.708 --> 08:48.959
- [Door Chime Rings]
- Hi, guys. Welcome to New York.

08:49.045 --> 08:50.955
- Did you have a good trip?
- Not bad.

08:51.048 --> 08:52.957
Guys, I'd like you to meet
Tracy Richter.

08:53.050 --> 08:55.423
Tracy, I'd like you to meet my team.
Hannibal Smith.

08:55.511 --> 08:56.922
- Hello.
- Hi.

08:57.013 --> 08:59.220
- Howling Mad Murdock.
- Howdy-doody.

08:59.307 --> 09:02.392
- And B.A. Baracus.
- Hi.

09:02.478 --> 09:05.147
Tracy and her mom have
the bakery across the street.

09:05.231 --> 09:08.398
- Best danish in the city.
- Thanks for coming here to help us.

09:08.485 --> 09:10.477
Man, this place is full of junk.

09:10.570 --> 09:12.647
B.A., I didn"t exactly come here
with a bankroll.

09:12.739 --> 09:15.741
I had to lease this store,
and it really set me back.

09:15.826 --> 09:20.703
So I had to scrounge most of this stuff
out ofjunkyards and secondhand shops.

09:27.089 --> 09:29.497
- [Clicks Switch]
- Hey, man, I was watchin' first.

09:29.592 --> 09:32.262
You're making me miss the best part.

09:38.227 --> 09:42.178
Oh, man...
No, no, this is good too. Watch this.

09:42.274 --> 09:45.109
B.A., you want to come back here?

09:48.531 --> 09:51.449
Your friend sure has
a weird sense of humour.

09:51.534 --> 09:54.869
Yes, he has a weird
sense of... something.

09:54.955 --> 09:56.865
[B.A.] Face, we"re gonna need
a monitor that works.

09:56.957 --> 09:59.081
Check those out.
Maybe they're a little better.

09:59.168 --> 10:02.086
Face, you got anything for me?

10:02.172 --> 10:04.129
Well, uh...

10:09.097 --> 10:12.133
These things look like junk.

10:12.225 --> 10:14.218
Are these things gonna work?

10:14.311 --> 10:16.387
- Who knows?
- Oh, wonderful.

10:16.480 --> 10:19.018
Best I could do.

10:19.108 --> 10:22.312
I, uh, got it all out of this.

10:22.404 --> 10:25.654
Ever meet any of these guys
waiting for the world to end?

10:25.741 --> 10:31.198
- Yeah.
- Weird. Anyway, it's all I could get,
which wasn't easy.

10:31.289 --> 10:36.248
Most of the other buyers were
plainclothes cops snapping pictures
and taking down names.

10:36.336 --> 10:38.294
They better work.

10:40.675 --> 10:43.593
Better start laying the cable, B.A.,
for the camera.

10:43.678 --> 10:47.427
And we have to find another
location for the monitoring.

10:47.516 --> 10:49.426
We own a bakery shop
across the street.

10:49.518 --> 10:55.392
I'm sure you could use that if
you could convince my mother
and the others to still hire you.

10:55.484 --> 10:57.393
Still hire us?

10:57.486 --> 11:01.899
Yeah. Amy explained it all when
she called you yesterday, right?

11:01.991 --> 11:05.610
- Right?
- No. I didn't get a chance to call.

11:05.704 --> 11:10.034
- Didn't get a chance to call?
- All right. I just didn't call.

11:10.126 --> 11:12.368
One of the store owners, Mr Laskey...

11:12.462 --> 11:14.953
got beat up yesterday,
just before Face and I arrived.

11:15.048 --> 11:17.539
He"s in the hospital
and hurt pretty badly.

11:17.634 --> 11:21.549
So the other store owners are scared
and having second thoughts
about hiring us.

11:21.639 --> 11:26.302
Hey, man, if they decided this
yesterday, maybe I didn"t have to fly.

11:26.395 --> 11:28.387
Even though flying's
not that bad.

11:28.480 --> 11:32.064
Look, these guys are taking money
from these people...

11:32.151 --> 11:35.272
in exchange for not destroying
their shops or hurting their families.

11:35.363 --> 11:38.780
- They need help, Hannibal.
- Yeah, it's the old protection racket.

11:38.867 --> 11:41.822
They"re taking so much
money from us now...

11:41.913 --> 11:44.451
I don't think we can afford to
keep the store open another month.

11:46.835 --> 11:49.753
These people are frightened.
Someone has to do something for them.

12:02.895 --> 12:06.514
[Man, German Accent]
They beat up Mr Laskey,
and they broke Mr Daniels"s fingers.

12:06.608 --> 12:09.977
I don"t care if you came
all the way from Los Angeles.

12:10.070 --> 12:12.194
You should go home, Mr Smith!

12:12.281 --> 12:14.191
We have here already enough trouble.

12:14.283 --> 12:16.822
Why would we want to making
more trouble for ourselves?

12:16.911 --> 12:19.617
Bernie, they busted up
my place twice...

12:19.706 --> 12:21.616
and they've taken my money
for months.

12:21.709 --> 12:25.043
Now, yesterday, they took my display case
and threw it right out of the window.

12:25.129 --> 12:28.499
And when I told I 'em I wasn't gonna
take it any more, that felt great!

12:28.592 --> 12:31.048
Yeah, and then they
broke your fingers, huh?

12:31.136 --> 12:33.046
And the next time
they may break your neck.

12:33.139 --> 12:37.967
Next time it won't be anything,
if we go to work, Mr Shatzman.

12:38.061 --> 12:41.146
Hey, little brother, where you goin'?

12:42.650 --> 12:45.188
- [Door Closes]
- Who hit you?

12:45.278 --> 12:48.196
That creep, Digger,
when I got some polish on his sock.

12:48.281 --> 12:52.196
He went nuts. Threw my shoeshine box
out into the street.

12:52.286 --> 12:55.869
Busted it up good.
He didn't even pay me for the shine.

12:55.957 --> 12:59.161
You see? You see?
Even the young boy.

12:59.252 --> 13:02.752
That's how these monsters treat people.
You want us to fight them?

13:02.840 --> 13:06.885
Huh? We don't even know who they are,
who sends them, where they come from.

13:06.970 --> 13:11.134
Mr Smith,
when Stan went to L.A. to find you...

13:11.225 --> 13:14.594
your contact quoted
a very expensive price.

13:14.687 --> 13:18.353
Well, anything is worth it
to get rid of these leeches.

13:18.441 --> 13:21.526
But we haven't got anything
left to pay you with.

13:21.612 --> 13:23.688
What you say, little man?

13:23.781 --> 13:26.818
I busted my buns
saving up for that shoe box.

13:26.909 --> 13:28.819
Took me a month.

13:28.912 --> 13:34.037
This is all I got left. Every cent.
But I want to chip in to help.

13:34.126 --> 13:37.211
$3.68.

13:37.296 --> 13:40.084
That just about covers our fee.

13:40.175 --> 13:43.129
And if you fail,
then things will be worse.

13:43.220 --> 13:45.925
They won't fail.
I've seen what they can do.

13:46.015 --> 13:49.550
- They won't.
- Then it's all agreed?

13:49.644 --> 13:52.182
[Murmuring]

13:52.272 --> 13:54.312
- All right?
- Ja, ja.

13:55.901 --> 13:58.737
Tomorrow's the grand opening.

14:00.573 --> 14:03.147
[Chuckling]

14:26.061 --> 14:28.304
It's them, Amy.
The grocery store.

14:28.397 --> 14:31.482
If it starts to look bad, let me know,
and I'll be in there.

14:45.167 --> 14:47.374
[Dings]

14:47.461 --> 14:50.997
- Hey, wait a minute,
that's my whole week's.
- Interest, brother, interest.

14:51.090 --> 14:55.041
When you pull Scully and me down here
to remind you that you're overdue...

14:55.137 --> 14:58.387
then we have to charge you
for personalized service.

14:58.474 --> 15:00.681
Next time,
keep your own calendar.

15:00.768 --> 15:04.054
- Ow!
- It's cheaper all around.

15:19.498 --> 15:22.072
B.A., they're heading
towards Hannibal's shop.

15:33.181 --> 15:36.301
- Fresh coffee. Sweet and light.
- Thanks.

15:38.312 --> 15:41.432
You know, I think we were getting
a better picture on this yesterday
before B.A. messed with it.

15:41.524 --> 15:44.311
- Isn't he just wonderful?
- Wonderful.

15:44.402 --> 15:48.697
[Amy On Walkie-Talkie]
Face, Murdock, they're heading
towards Hannibal's shop.

15:51.035 --> 15:53.823
Good day. Good day.

15:53.913 --> 15:55.953
We're looking for the man
who owns this joint.

15:56.041 --> 15:57.950
Ja. That is me.

15:59.962 --> 16:02.880
Ah, may I be of assistance, please?

16:02.965 --> 16:06.335
You got to be kidding!
This blind dude fixing TVs?

16:06.428 --> 16:09.002
Oh, my nephew helps with that.

16:09.098 --> 16:14.971
He is not here today, but you can
leave with me your television
and tell me your problem.

16:15.063 --> 16:19.560
We don't have any problems.
We're insurance salesmen.

16:19.651 --> 16:23.650
Insurance?
Oh, thank you, I have insurance.

16:23.740 --> 16:26.824
Not the kind we have, Pop.

16:26.910 --> 16:31.288
- What was that?
- Oh, that's my buddy knockin' over
some of your goodies.

16:31.373 --> 16:33.995
I hope he isn't hurt.

16:37.255 --> 16:40.257
- What's going on here?
- Here's what I'm talkin' about.

16:40.342 --> 16:42.465
Lord knows what can happen
to somebody like you...

16:42.553 --> 16:44.842
who ain't got
the right kind of insurance.

16:44.931 --> 16:46.840
Now, we got great monthly rates.

16:46.933 --> 16:48.926
Check it out with
your friends on the street.

16:49.019 --> 16:50.928
I never heard of such a thing.

16:51.021 --> 16:55.399
I come here to work, to do business.

16:55.485 --> 16:57.774
Look, we got
a special introductory rate.

16:57.862 --> 17:03.368
One grand down
and you get the last month free.

17:03.452 --> 17:06.868
l... I wasn't here last month.

17:06.955 --> 17:09.281
That's it!

17:09.376 --> 17:12.828
[Static]

17:12.922 --> 17:16.837
Houston, we got a problem.
So much for videotape on these guys.

17:19.262 --> 17:22.429
- What are you doing?
- We can't leave Hannibal with no contact.

17:26.980 --> 17:29.767
There's only 110 bucks here.

17:29.858 --> 17:34.188
Less than our usual down payment,
but we take instalments.

17:34.280 --> 17:36.522
We'll be back
for the other 800 in two days.

17:36.616 --> 17:39.819
- Two days?
- And so you won't forget...

17:39.911 --> 17:42.829
Scully's gonna mark
your calendar for you. [Chuckling]

17:42.915 --> 17:45.073
One, two!

17:47.503 --> 17:50.421
Boy, I'll never know why they
call these things portable.

17:50.507 --> 17:52.583
They're so doggone heavy.

17:52.676 --> 17:55.132
Yeah, uh, give me a hand with this.
It's...

18:27.800 --> 18:29.710
What's the point of surveillance?
What's the point of protection?

18:29.802 --> 18:31.961
- What happened?
- A cracked rib.

18:32.055 --> 18:34.593
Good Lord.
I don't understand.

18:34.683 --> 18:37.887
I thought you were supposed
to be able to handle yourselves.

18:37.979 --> 18:40.221
I think I did very well,
considering the circumstances.

18:40.315 --> 18:42.557
Oh, you could've handled
those bags of gristle.

18:42.651 --> 18:44.560
They were just
hired muscle, Murdock.

18:44.653 --> 18:48.319
I had to let 'em go so B.A.
could follow them back to their home base.

18:48.407 --> 18:50.946
I suppose a doctor's
out of the question.

18:52.287 --> 18:54.244
I'm fine.

18:55.290 --> 18:57.829
I love it when a plan comes together.

19:10.433 --> 19:14.930
They stopped off and rousted storekeepers
in three other neighbourhoods.

19:15.022 --> 19:18.605
We movin' uptown now,
passin' 86th Street.

19:39.300 --> 19:42.218
Charlie, you keep saying we're going,
but we don't.

19:42.303 --> 19:45.720
I want to show you that dress they have
before they sell it to somebody else.

19:45.807 --> 19:48.643
But it's this, then it's that,
then it's just a sec...

19:48.727 --> 19:51.645
Give me a second, baby.
I've got business, here.

19:54.234 --> 19:57.069
Oh. Now we're really
not going anywhere.

19:57.154 --> 20:00.321
Made the run down on
the East Side. No problem.

20:00.408 --> 20:03.777
There's a new fish opened up a shop
down on Delancey Street.

20:03.870 --> 20:06.196
- Blind dude.
- Was he civic-minded enough...

20:06.289 --> 20:08.863
to join the neighbourhood
community chest?

20:08.959 --> 20:13.373
Oh, yes. We're gonna get back
to him in a couple of days
and get another contribution.

20:13.464 --> 20:16.003
Charlie, you promised.

20:16.092 --> 20:18.500
Oh, give it a rest, would you, baby?
Go to the powder room...

20:18.595 --> 20:21.087
find a run in your stocking
or something, huh?

20:21.182 --> 20:23.091
Let me check this out here.

20:27.105 --> 20:29.775
Hold it right there, buddy.
We don't open till 4.00.

20:29.858 --> 20:33.691
Say, Jack, I'm a cab driver.
I come in to pick up a fare.

20:36.283 --> 20:38.074
Say, you need a lift?

20:38.160 --> 20:43.321
Uh, look, Charlie, if you're gonna
be busy, I can go shopping alone.

20:43.416 --> 20:45.456
You're not goin' anywhere,
sweetheart.

20:46.670 --> 20:48.828
Nobody called for any cab,
so beat it.

21:00.853 --> 21:05.681
Hey, what are you, uh...

21:05.775 --> 21:09.987
- What are you smiling at?
- Nothing. It's a crime to smile?

21:10.072 --> 21:12.278
Unless I say otherwise.

21:17.038 --> 21:18.948
[Horn Honks]

21:33.682 --> 21:36.637
The Sugar Hill nightclub
on 89th Street.

21:36.728 --> 21:38.721
[Hannibal]
Okay, B.A., bring it on back.

21:46.406 --> 21:48.897
The Sugar Hill Club
belongs to one Charles F. Struthers...

21:48.992 --> 21:50.901
otherwise known as
East-Side Charlie.

21:50.994 --> 21:53.830
I ran the plates on the car,
and they are registered to the club.

21:53.914 --> 21:55.824
I also had a friend of mine
at the New York Times...

21:55.917 --> 21:57.826
put Struthers through
the police computer.

21:57.919 --> 21:59.828
He was arrested several times
when he was younger...

21:59.921 --> 22:04.133
but just some minor offences...
breaking a couple of windows, joyriding.

22:04.218 --> 22:07.469
But later on, he was associated
with a number of underworld figures...

22:07.555 --> 22:09.465
and it's believed
that he's a major operator...

22:09.557 --> 22:13.057
on running numbers,
loan sharking and extortion.

22:13.145 --> 22:15.897
But he knows how to keep
his own hands clean...

22:15.982 --> 22:19.980
so no convictions, no arrests.

22:20.070 --> 22:22.739
Sounds like a hell of a guy.

22:22.823 --> 22:26.027
Man, I want to go up there,
grab this dude by his heels...

22:26.118 --> 22:28.028
turn him upside down...

22:28.121 --> 22:32.071
and shake all the money out of his pockets
that he owe these people.

22:32.167 --> 22:35.453
Now what fun is there in that?

22:35.546 --> 22:39.414
I think we ought to give Mr Struthers
a whiff of his own cologne.

22:39.509 --> 22:42.131
Hannibal, this sounds like
one of those plans.

22:42.220 --> 22:44.130
And whenever we use
one of those plans...

22:44.223 --> 22:46.132
somebody always
gets mad at us.

22:46.225 --> 22:50.603
- Yeah.
- What kind of tricks you up to now?

22:50.688 --> 22:53.643
I think I hear
one of them coming now.

22:53.734 --> 22:56.190
Take a look.

23:20.223 --> 23:23.509
Ah. Surprise!

23:23.602 --> 23:26.639
- A garbage truck?
- It sure is.

23:26.730 --> 23:29.601
How are you gonna get our money back
with a garbage truck?

23:29.692 --> 23:33.441
Wait and see, Nicky.
Wait and see.

23:33.530 --> 23:36.365
It's nice, Face, nice.

23:39.412 --> 23:43.410
- It's empty.
- You told me you wanted a garbage truck.

23:43.500 --> 23:45.457
Do you know what I went through
to get this garbage truck?

23:45.544 --> 23:48.462
I didn't say I wanted it empty.
Now, what good is it empty?

23:48.547 --> 23:53.673
- How am I supposed to know that?
- Face, I need garbage.

23:56.265 --> 23:58.174
And I don't just mean any garbage.

23:58.267 --> 24:01.185
Ah! You need a specific kind of garbage.

24:01.270 --> 24:04.521
When I say garbage, I mean garbage.
Dirty garbage!

24:04.608 --> 24:07.811
Most garbage is dirty, Hannibal.
That"s why they call it garbage.

24:07.903 --> 24:10.110
Oh, he means real garbage.

24:10.197 --> 24:14.362
Only a sucker like you
would understand garbage.

24:14.452 --> 24:17.786
Garbage.
First I got to take the cab back.

24:17.873 --> 24:21.207
- Why?
- For the night shift.
How do you think I got it?

24:21.294 --> 24:23.203
I had to dummy a hack licence
to take a job.

24:23.296 --> 24:27.081
Hannibal, you want all these things...
a taxicab, garbage truck, TV store.

24:27.175 --> 24:30.212
You know, I don't keep all this stuff in
a coffee can in my backyard, you know.

24:30.304 --> 24:33.305
Just... Just take it easy, Face,
take it easy.

24:33.391 --> 24:35.467
B.A. and I will take care
of the garbage detail...

24:35.560 --> 24:39.261
'cause I know exactly
what Hannibal wants.

24:39.356 --> 24:41.480
First, we gonna hit
the industrial areas...

24:41.567 --> 24:44.901
and then we gonna hit
restaurant row.

24:44.988 --> 24:47.313
They got great garbage!

24:51.370 --> 24:53.363
- I shall return.
- [Engine Starts]

24:53.456 --> 24:56.825
Garbage, ho!

25:00.506 --> 25:02.546
- Ho!
- [Engine Revving]

25:03.968 --> 25:07.254
Ho!

25:18.402 --> 25:20.311
[Murdock]
Bogey on the right! Bogey on the right!

25:20.404 --> 25:23.820
- We are in target range
of some hellacious garbage, man.
- Shut up, Murdock!

25:23.908 --> 25:26.067
Mmm! Yes, indeedy.

25:26.161 --> 25:28.866
The thing I like about the A-Team
is you get a chance at such diversity.

25:28.955 --> 25:31.743
- Career diversity.
- We're garbagemen, fool!

25:43.139 --> 25:47.351
[French Accent] Ooh la la!
It's just like Mama used to make!

25:47.435 --> 25:49.677
B.A.!

25:49.771 --> 25:53.223
This is garbage. Smell this.

25:54.986 --> 25:58.901
An ambrosial delight
for the olfactory system.

26:00.283 --> 26:02.193
Yeah, man,
that was the best load yet.

26:02.286 --> 26:04.528
Wait. Wait a minute.

26:04.622 --> 26:07.292
The nose knows.

26:07.375 --> 26:09.748
Hang a right.
We got another one comin' up.

26:09.836 --> 26:12.043
Man, how do you
put up with yourself?

26:12.131 --> 26:14.088
It's difficult at times.

26:16.010 --> 26:18.680
## [Singing]

26:24.979 --> 26:27.351
Turn right! Turn right!

26:40.413 --> 26:44.743
- Gentlemen, there'll be no tables
available until tonight.
- We would like to see Herr Struthers.

26:44.835 --> 26:46.793
We fix his TVs.

26:46.879 --> 26:49.453
It's the blind guy
from the TV shop on Delancey.

26:49.549 --> 26:52.087
I wonder how he found us.

26:52.177 --> 26:54.300
Uh, Herr Struthers?

26:54.388 --> 26:56.962
I believe we have
some business to attend.

26:57.058 --> 27:00.012
Hey, Pops, would you leave
Mr Struthers alone, okay?

27:00.103 --> 27:03.472
Oh, uh, well, my nephew and I...

27:03.565 --> 27:07.314
we would like to have
you have your men...

27:07.403 --> 27:09.776
not coming down
to Delancey Street...

27:09.864 --> 27:12.153
and extorting money
from all of us shopkeepers.

27:12.242 --> 27:14.199
I'm supposed to know
what you're talkin' about?

27:14.286 --> 27:16.575
He doesn't know what
you're talking about, Uncle.

27:16.664 --> 27:21.540
Oh, I'll explain.
Your men, they come down...

27:21.628 --> 27:25.377
and they threaten to hurt and
kill my friends if they don't pay.

27:27.134 --> 27:29.044
Digger, look, would you do me a favour?

27:29.137 --> 27:33.384
Give this gentleman and his nephew a
drink and put "em at one of those tables.

27:35.143 --> 27:37.220
We did not come here to drink,
Herr Struthers.

27:37.313 --> 27:41.097
- What did you come here for?
- Well, uh, all together...

27:41.192 --> 27:44.644
including monies
unjustly appropriated...

27:44.738 --> 27:46.647
interest, damages, incidentals...

27:46.740 --> 27:50.952
oh, and a minor fee
for our collection service...

27:51.037 --> 27:53.955
$ 166, 200.

27:54.040 --> 27:56.033
- Ja.
- Yeah.

27:56.126 --> 27:59.211
- That's rounded off
to the nearest hundred.
- Ja.

28:00.840 --> 28:04.625
Oh, you think my guys and I have been
taking money from some fruit peddlers...

28:04.719 --> 28:06.926
and you expect that I should pay it back.

28:07.014 --> 28:09.766
Ja, if you would be so kind.

28:09.850 --> 28:14.976
[All Laughing]

28:20.404 --> 28:23.940
Well, I want to tell you, l...

28:24.034 --> 28:28.743
I don't carry that kind of money with me.
And even if I had, I wouldn't...

28:28.831 --> 28:31.832
I wouldn't be able to pay it back
to you this particular moment.

28:33.002 --> 28:35.873
Don't take my proposal too lightly.

28:38.425 --> 28:42.589
- Listen, what did you want?
- 166,200 bucks.

28:47.060 --> 28:50.761
Now that I got your attention...

28:50.856 --> 28:53.145
I'll lay it out for you.

28:55.403 --> 28:58.358
You get one more trip
downtown. One!

29:01.827 --> 29:04.995
And that's to pay back all the money
you took from those people...

29:05.081 --> 29:07.703
on Delancey, Houston
and Bleeker Streets.

29:07.793 --> 29:10.996
Just so you don't forget the figure.

29:11.088 --> 29:12.962
Delancey. Noon tomorrow.

29:13.049 --> 29:15.505
We'll have the soup line.
You bring the bread.

29:15.593 --> 29:20.422
You got any idea when garbage day is
around here, Struthers?

29:21.767 --> 29:24.519
Oh, come on, fella, don't be like that.

29:24.604 --> 29:26.513
When's trash pickup around here?

29:27.774 --> 29:30.811
Uh, tomorrow.

29:30.903 --> 29:33.690
Tomorrow, you and I
have an appointment.

29:33.781 --> 29:35.821
Just so you don't forget...

29:35.909 --> 29:38.365
I thought we'd mark
your calendar for you.

29:38.453 --> 29:41.490
[Beeps]

29:53.846 --> 29:57.263
- You're nuts, man!
- I am the one who's nuts, man.

29:57.350 --> 29:59.308
Right over here.

30:23.839 --> 30:25.797
Drinks are on the house!

30:25.883 --> 30:28.635
[lmitating Porky Pig]
Th-Th-That's all, folks.

30:44.321 --> 30:48.865
Get those suckers!
The guys who get them stay alive!

31:00.423 --> 31:04.588
- I want those guys!
- We'll get 'em, Charlie.
Just take it light.

31:04.678 --> 31:06.588
Take it light. Take it light!

31:06.681 --> 31:09.006
They come up here and make
a fool out of me in my own place...

31:09.100 --> 31:12.185
and you're tellin' me to take it light!

31:12.270 --> 31:15.188
So far it looks like about
20 G's in damage, Charlie.

31:15.274 --> 31:17.944
A bunch of peddlers hired
gunslingers to do this to me.

31:18.027 --> 31:21.860
It had to be a set-up.
Those guys couldn't be TV store owners.

31:21.948 --> 31:24.440
No kiddin'.

31:24.535 --> 31:28.403
Look, I want the whole street.
Get Floyd and get Ripper.

31:28.498 --> 31:31.452
We're gonna go up there...

31:31.543 --> 31:34.877
early in the morning
when they open shop.

31:34.963 --> 31:36.921
We're gonna have us a block party.

32:32.530 --> 32:35.532
Okay, Face, it's hooked up.
String the wire.

33:42.278 --> 33:45.528
Looks like we are
preparing for war.

33:45.615 --> 33:47.572
Could be we are.

33:48.577 --> 33:50.534
Tell me something.

33:50.621 --> 33:55.533
You are not really sure that you
can get him to pay us back...

33:55.627 --> 33:57.703
which means that, uh...

33:57.796 --> 34:00.418
you are not sure
that you will be paid.

34:00.507 --> 34:06.048
[Chuckles]
So tell me, why are you doing this?

34:06.139 --> 34:10.848
Anyone can spend their afternoons
playing golf.

34:10.936 --> 34:13.806
But don't you think
this is more fun?

34:29.248 --> 34:31.242
I got 'em coming out.

34:31.335 --> 34:34.121
And they don't look like they woke up
on the right side of the bed, fellas.

34:35.840 --> 34:39.422
Stay with 'em, kid. Let me know
if they pick up reinforcements.

34:39.511 --> 34:41.670
Auf Wiedersehen.

34:45.351 --> 34:47.260
149th, and move it.

34:47.353 --> 34:49.891
- Sorry. I'm not on duty.
- You are now.

34:49.981 --> 34:52.603
I'm late and I got to get where I'm goin'
and you're gonna take me there.

34:52.693 --> 34:55.445
I can't. If you want to report me
to the hack commission...

34:55.529 --> 35:00.192
- Hit it, Jack, before I come up there
and hit your face.
- Oh, great.

35:09.003 --> 35:11.293
[Tyres Screeching]

35:13.467 --> 35:17.216
I want everybody to get up
in their rooms and keep your heads down.

35:17.305 --> 35:19.879
You'll be safe there.
Right away.

35:38.079 --> 35:40.784
You're supposed to go to 149th!
That's right!

35:40.874 --> 35:43.911
And I told you I'm off duty.
Now, come on, give me a break.

35:44.002 --> 35:47.372
- I'll break your face, man!
How about that?
- Not the face.

35:47.465 --> 35:49.422
Hey, I told you... 149th.

35:52.470 --> 35:55.176
What the heck is that, huh?

35:55.265 --> 35:58.635
Safety locks. They can only be
opened and closed by the driver...

35:58.728 --> 36:01.184
to protect people like me
from people like you.

36:01.272 --> 36:03.894
I get out of here,
you're dead meat, man!

36:03.984 --> 36:05.941
You hear that? Dead meat!

36:06.028 --> 36:08.780
And people say
cabbies are rude.

36:17.124 --> 36:19.283
Uh, Hannibal,
I got 'em coming east on...

36:19.377 --> 36:23.921
- Dead, man! You"re dead!
- Hey, hey! I'm tryin' to have
a conversation up here.

36:24.007 --> 36:26.130
What was that?

36:26.218 --> 36:28.425
Oh, it's nothin'.

36:28.512 --> 36:31.086
Struthers's coming east on Sixth.

36:31.182 --> 36:33.222
If he was picking up backup,
he'd have done it by now.

36:33.310 --> 36:36.264
Well, it's showtime, kid.
Get back here on the double.

36:36.355 --> 36:40.187
Uh, yeah, right.
Firing retrorockets.

36:55.877 --> 36:57.835
That's the cab that was
following us all day.

37:03.678 --> 37:05.636
Okay, call in the boys.

37:43.725 --> 37:47.059
Hey! Hey, unlock this damn thing!
Let me out of here!

37:47.145 --> 37:51.309
Believe me, you'll be safer in there.
And I'd stay down if I were you.

37:51.400 --> 37:53.358
Hey!

38:18.640 --> 38:21.677
Okay, you send a few bozos to my club...

38:21.769 --> 38:25.434
you dump garbage in my place...

38:25.523 --> 38:27.433
and you think that's a big laugh!

38:27.525 --> 38:30.195
Well, now l"m gonna show you
what a real mess is.

38:30.279 --> 38:33.695
I'm gonna make you pay!

38:33.783 --> 38:36.108
I'm gonna take this out on your hide!

39:02.566 --> 39:08.071
Face, we got a couple uninvited guests,
and they brought party favours.

39:08.156 --> 39:10.065
I thought you said
there was only one car.

39:10.158 --> 39:13.325
Even when they play dirty,
they play dirty.

39:13.412 --> 39:16.828
Yeah, but we play dirtier.

39:18.835 --> 39:20.828
[Door Chime Rings]

39:24.758 --> 39:27.795
What's the matter, your watch stop?
You're early.

39:27.887 --> 39:31.091
You got a lot of wise lip responses,
don't ya?

39:31.183 --> 39:35.810
I hope everybody on this street knows
I'm gonna wipe out this neighbourhood
and flush it down the sewer.

39:35.896 --> 39:41.568
- What's your wise lip response to that?
- $ 166, 200.

39:41.653 --> 39:44.608
That will buy you
a safe trip out of here.

39:44.698 --> 39:47.106
Well, buy this.

39:47.201 --> 39:49.324
You're really a jamoke.

39:52.207 --> 39:54.164
Okay, do it.

40:03.095 --> 40:05.800
Bombs away!

41:46.006 --> 41:48.212
Throw out your guns!

42:03.401 --> 42:05.193
Bull's-eye!

42:14.872 --> 42:18.324
[Gunfire Continues]

42:25.635 --> 42:28.387
Uh... Ow!

42:37.565 --> 42:40.318
Yeah! Whoo!

42:45.575 --> 42:48.410
Murdock!

42:48.495 --> 42:51.911
I guess I bobbed
when I should've weaved.

42:53.584 --> 42:55.162
[Hannibal]
Drop it.

42:55.253 --> 42:58.337
Okay. Across the street in the cab.

42:59.758 --> 43:01.667
Move!

43:05.932 --> 43:07.841
Come on, man!
Come on, come on, come on!

43:15.026 --> 43:17.268
Next time, pick on
somebody your own size!

43:30.669 --> 43:32.211
Don't ask.

43:36.050 --> 43:39.965
Where are we, uh, going?

43:40.055 --> 43:44.468
Uptown. To your office
to look in the safe.

43:44.560 --> 43:48.309
$ 166,200, remember?

43:57.074 --> 44:01.120
Hannibal, I know you love it
when a plan comes together.

44:17.974 --> 44:21.426
We better get going. Sooner or later,
Struthers is gonna convince the cops...

44:21.519 --> 44:24.189
it wasn't a bunch of storekeepers
who wrapped him up.

44:24.273 --> 44:26.182
Too bad you have to go.

44:26.275 --> 44:29.561
Well, uh, actually,
I usually stay behind.

44:29.654 --> 44:31.777
You know,
handle any cleanup necessary.

44:31.865 --> 44:35.448
Return the taxi, garbage truck,
uh, any other loose ends.

44:35.536 --> 44:39.119
So l"ll probably be here
at least another couple days.

44:39.207 --> 44:42.623
That's great! I'm stayin' too.

44:42.711 --> 44:46.543
Tracy's gonna show me
all around New York. Look.

44:46.632 --> 44:48.625
She's gonna show me
Central Park...

44:48.718 --> 44:50.876
the Statue of Liberty
and the Empire State Building.

44:50.970 --> 44:52.880
You know, where that big hairy ape got...
[lmitating Gunshots]

44:52.973 --> 44:54.882
[lmitates Ape, Laughs]

44:54.975 --> 44:57.301
I, uh, think I'll pass.

44:57.394 --> 44:59.304
That puts us back
on a commercial flight.

44:59.397 --> 45:01.888
- That good with you, B.A.?
- No, it ain't!

45:01.983 --> 45:05.483
I called that stewardess.
It was a recording for Dial-A-Joke.

45:05.571 --> 45:08.358
You called that number?
That isn't fair.

45:08.449 --> 45:10.406
You're right,
and we're gonna talk about this, man.

45:10.493 --> 45:14.325
Hey, later, B.A.
We're gonna miss visiting hours.

45:14.414 --> 45:16.906
You lucky we're goin' to the hospital
to visit Mr Laskey...

45:17.000 --> 45:20.999
- and tell him how
Nicky helped get his money back.
- Looks like it's you and me, kid.

45:21.089 --> 45:24.505
Sorry. I got an appointment too. You
know that friend of mine at the Times?

45:24.593 --> 45:26.502
He's an old boyfriend
I haven't seen for a few years...

45:26.595 --> 45:28.671
and some of that magic
may still be happening.

45:28.764 --> 45:30.887
How about a ride to the airport, Face?

45:30.975 --> 45:34.760
Oh, sorry, Hannibal, but I gotta
get this back for the night shift.

45:34.855 --> 45:39.351
- You can drop me off at the Times.
- Maybe you can drop us off
at the hospital.

45:39.443 --> 45:43.572
Whoa! I'd like to give all you guys
a lift, but I'm gonna have hell to pay.

45:43.656 --> 45:45.566
You know, I've been
pushin' this hack for two days...

45:45.659 --> 45:48.233
without puttin' up much
on the meter, so, uh...

45:48.328 --> 45:51.365
Well, I'm already scheduled for
a real chewin' out from that dispatcher...

45:51.457 --> 45:53.533
when I clock out tonight.

46:03.012 --> 46:06.548
Gettin' friendly with
the rest of the cabbies, Face?

46:06.641 --> 46:10.640
Well, they've been kind
of short of drivers, so she's been
helpin' out behind the wheel.

46:12.315 --> 46:14.604
That's the dispatcher.
