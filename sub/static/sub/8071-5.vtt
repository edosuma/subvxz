00:03.871 --> 00:06.274
[theme music]

00:56.690 --> 00:59.927
What is the importance of
proper weight distribution?

00:59.960 --> 01:02.096
To avoid being top-heavy.

01:02.130 --> 01:03.831
You don't have to worry
about that, Aunt Jackie.

01:06.634 --> 01:09.303
God, I hate Kathy Bowman.

01:09.337 --> 01:11.105
BECKY: And today's reason is?

01:11.139 --> 01:13.006
Well, she spends
about a billion dollars

01:13.040 --> 01:15.042
on all this furniture that
looks like it belongs in Italy,

01:15.075 --> 01:16.210
you know.

01:16.244 --> 01:18.946
And now here she is
giving it away to charity.

01:18.979 --> 01:22.783
This couch don't even
have any butt dents in it.

01:22.816 --> 01:26.019
How can you take a
nice charitable thing

01:26.053 --> 01:28.956
and turn it into a
mean vindictive thing?

01:28.989 --> 01:33.327
Hey, that's what makes me, me.

01:33.361 --> 01:34.595
Now look at this coffee table.

01:34.628 --> 01:37.765
She's just giving
that away to show off.

01:37.798 --> 01:39.533
Becky, quiz me.

01:39.567 --> 01:41.469
OK.

01:41.502 --> 01:43.371
Gross vehicle weight.

01:43.404 --> 01:46.474
Total weight of single
vehicle plus its load.

01:46.507 --> 01:47.375
OK.

01:47.408 --> 01:48.342
That's it.

01:48.376 --> 01:50.178
That is way too
good for the needy.

01:50.211 --> 01:51.011
I'll be back.

01:55.082 --> 01:56.384
- Ready?
- Yeah.

01:56.417 --> 01:57.418
OK.

01:57.451 --> 01:59.187
What is the proper
procedure to follow

01:59.220 --> 02:01.355
if your vehicle is
leaking toxic fluids

02:01.389 --> 02:02.690
in a residential neighborhood?

02:02.723 --> 02:04.425
OK, that's got something
to do with those orange cones

02:04.458 --> 02:05.959
they give you, right?

02:05.993 --> 02:06.860
No.

02:06.894 --> 02:08.061
OK, forget that.

02:08.095 --> 02:09.897
They're never going to
ask that on a test anyway.

02:09.930 --> 02:11.031
Anybody bring the paper in?

02:11.064 --> 02:11.865
No, of course not.

02:15.569 --> 02:18.172
Becky, I'm really sorry.

02:18.206 --> 02:19.340
About what?

02:19.373 --> 02:22.243
I didn't mean it.

02:22.276 --> 02:23.777
What did you do,
you little freak?

02:23.811 --> 02:25.579
I was up in your room.

02:25.613 --> 02:27.415
It was an accident.

02:27.448 --> 02:30.484
Oh, I'm gonna kill you, DJ.

02:30.518 --> 02:33.153
DJ, what did you do?

02:33.187 --> 02:34.054
Nothing.

02:34.087 --> 02:36.089
Really?

02:36.123 --> 02:36.990
Yeah.

02:37.024 --> 02:37.825
Just driving her crazy.

02:41.195 --> 02:43.397
Excellent work, son.

02:43.431 --> 02:46.166
Thanks, Dad.

02:46.200 --> 02:47.468
So damn proud I could burst.

02:56.277 --> 02:58.045
Stay.

02:58.078 --> 02:59.980
God, is that tacky.

03:00.013 --> 03:01.582
I know it.

03:01.615 --> 03:02.683
Hey, do you believe Kathy Bowen?

03:02.716 --> 03:04.518
She's giving this away
the Good Samaritan?

03:04.552 --> 03:08.121
You know, these things
go for $200 at Rodbell's.

03:08.155 --> 03:09.690
I just go up to the
driver samaritan

03:09.723 --> 03:11.992
and I'll give them
$20, and it's ours.

03:12.025 --> 03:14.828
Plus the money is
going to charity.

03:14.862 --> 03:17.197
What do you think, Dan?

03:17.231 --> 03:18.632
Is it snow outside?

03:18.666 --> 03:21.469
Because this must be Christmas.

03:21.502 --> 03:23.237
I knew You'd love it.

03:23.271 --> 03:24.472
It's art.

03:24.505 --> 03:25.473
Oh, it ain't just art.

03:25.506 --> 03:26.874
Nuh-uh.

03:26.907 --> 03:28.609
It's got a big hole in the back
where you can stick stuff in.

03:34.715 --> 03:36.617
You done good, honey.

03:36.650 --> 03:37.685
This is a great piece of crap.

03:47.995 --> 03:51.665
Roseanne, what are you doing?

03:51.699 --> 03:55.068
Well, I'm changing the
cherry on the fruit cups, Leon.

03:55.102 --> 03:56.504
It is Wednesday, isn't it?

03:56.537 --> 03:58.138
All day.

03:58.171 --> 04:00.508
I thought so.

04:00.541 --> 04:02.576
How old are these?

04:02.610 --> 04:03.577
I don't know.

04:03.611 --> 04:05.178
They've been here
since I got hired.

04:08.248 --> 04:09.182
Hello, ladies.

04:09.216 --> 04:10.083
Hey, Steven.

04:10.117 --> 04:11.018
Hi.

04:11.051 --> 04:12.453
- Are you ready, Leon?
- Yes.

04:12.486 --> 04:13.787
In fact, we should
get a move on.

04:13.821 --> 04:15.656
We've got a lot
of packing to do.

04:15.689 --> 04:16.790
That's wonderful.

04:16.824 --> 04:18.292
What, you guys going
on a trip or something?

04:18.326 --> 04:19.327
Well, Steven is.

04:19.360 --> 04:20.694
Well, Steven is
because Steven always

04:20.728 --> 04:22.930
magically disappears whenever
Leon's mother comes to town.

04:22.963 --> 04:24.532
I thought we settled this.

04:24.565 --> 04:26.434
Well, you're not the one
being kicked out of your home,

04:26.467 --> 04:28.101
are you, Leon?

04:28.135 --> 04:29.337
What are you kicking now for?

04:29.370 --> 04:31.204
Don't your mom know you're gay?

04:31.238 --> 04:34.007
Roseanne.

04:34.041 --> 04:36.143
Yes, my mother knows
I'm gay, but that doesn't

04:36.176 --> 04:37.445
mean that she's going
to be comfortable

04:37.478 --> 04:39.713
staying in the same house
with me and my lover.

04:39.747 --> 04:40.614
Why not?

04:40.648 --> 04:41.915
Roseanne.

04:41.949 --> 04:43.384
What?

04:43.417 --> 04:45.218
It's his mom, she loves him.

04:45.252 --> 04:47.087
Jeez, I mean, how do they
know how she's gong to react

04:47.120 --> 04:48.856
unless they give her a chance?
- Thank you, Roseanne.

04:48.889 --> 04:50.157
That's exactly what
I have been saying

04:50.190 --> 04:51.959
for the last three years.

04:51.992 --> 04:53.226
Yes, thank you, Roseanne.

04:53.260 --> 04:54.328
And if you don't mind, butt out.

04:54.362 --> 04:55.228
No.

04:55.262 --> 04:56.630
No, no, no, no.

04:56.664 --> 04:57.898
I'd like to hear
what she has to say.

04:57.931 --> 04:59.032
Please, Roseanne.

04:59.066 --> 05:00.133
Don't look at me.

05:00.167 --> 05:02.970
I want to hear what
you have to say, too.

05:03.003 --> 05:09.076
Well, of course, I totally
agree with my boss' position

05:09.109 --> 05:13.381
here and everything, but I kind
of understand where Steven's

05:13.414 --> 05:14.848
coming from, too,
because you know,

05:14.882 --> 05:16.650
he just wants to
be acknowledged,

05:16.684 --> 05:18.018
you know, and he's kind--

05:18.051 --> 05:20.954
I mean, he's like your wife,
you know, or your husband.

05:20.988 --> 05:23.290
I mean, I don't really
know how you guys work

05:23.323 --> 05:25.826
this out or nothing.
like for instance,

05:25.859 --> 05:27.728
I don't know which one
of you does the cleaning

05:27.761 --> 05:30.764
and which one of you watches
"Monday Night Football."

05:30.798 --> 05:31.599
Yeah.

05:35.168 --> 05:38.539
That clearly was
a waste of time.

05:38.572 --> 05:40.841
Don't you think that I
should have the opportunity

05:40.874 --> 05:42.610
to get to know his mother?

05:42.643 --> 05:44.177
What are you asking her for?

05:44.211 --> 05:45.613
Because she understands, Leon.

05:45.646 --> 05:46.847
Everybody understands but you.

05:46.880 --> 05:48.215
Now, she is not everybody.

05:48.248 --> 05:50.618
She is nobody.

05:50.651 --> 05:54.688
Steven, my mother is
a 70-year-old woman.

05:54.722 --> 05:59.627
She was uncomfortable with
Mary Martin as Peter Pan.

05:59.660 --> 06:03.531
This is going to be very,
very awkward for her.

06:03.564 --> 06:05.633
It's going to be
awkward for you, Leon.

06:05.666 --> 06:07.601
Can we talk
about this at home?

06:07.635 --> 06:09.637
Tell me something, are you
embarrassed about who you are?

06:09.670 --> 06:10.538
No.

06:10.571 --> 06:11.639
Then is it about who I am?

06:11.672 --> 06:12.540
No.

06:12.573 --> 06:14.642
Then stop trying to hide me.

06:14.675 --> 06:17.044
Let me stay in my own home
when your mother visits.

06:17.077 --> 06:18.846
This is important to me, Leon.

06:18.879 --> 06:21.014
Leon, please.

06:24.418 --> 06:25.285
All right.

06:25.318 --> 06:28.088
No packing, you can stay.

06:28.121 --> 06:28.922
Thanks.

06:32.460 --> 06:35.629
Atta boy, Leon.

06:35.663 --> 06:38.131
Roseanne, did it ever occur
to you for just even one moment

06:38.165 --> 06:39.567
to stay out of this?

06:39.600 --> 06:40.601
Yeah.

06:40.634 --> 06:42.903
But by then, it
was way too late.

06:49.677 --> 06:52.446
Oh, you guys.

06:52.480 --> 06:55.749
My own fuzzy dice.

06:55.783 --> 06:56.650
Smell 'em.

06:56.684 --> 06:58.752
They smell.

06:58.786 --> 07:00.387
They were $2 more, but
when your sister-in-law

07:00.420 --> 07:03.824
gets her trucker's license,
you pull out all the stops.

07:03.857 --> 07:05.759
So you aced the
driving part, huh?

07:05.793 --> 07:06.794
Yeah.
Yeah.

07:06.827 --> 07:08.228
You'd be surprised
how courteous people

07:08.261 --> 07:10.330
are when they see an
18-wheeler with student

07:10.363 --> 07:11.832
driver written on it.

07:15.903 --> 07:17.805
So what comes next?

07:17.838 --> 07:19.206
Well, I start
out short-hauling

07:19.239 --> 07:21.742
and then ease into the four or
five- night interstate hauls.

07:21.775 --> 07:22.976
Five nights?
Wow.

07:23.010 --> 07:24.645
What do you do, stay
at motels and stuff?

07:24.678 --> 07:25.646
No.

07:25.679 --> 07:27.114
The cab's got a
sleeping compartment.

07:27.147 --> 07:29.483
Yeah, but it doesn't
have a shower, does it?

07:29.517 --> 07:33.153
Well, that's why she
needs to dice scented.

07:33.186 --> 07:36.423
Mrs. Bowman's coming
and she looks mad.

07:36.456 --> 07:37.525
Oh, jeez.

07:37.558 --> 07:38.926
That's my fault. My
rig's kind of blocking

07:38.959 --> 07:41.261
her driveway so I better
get her back to the lot

07:41.294 --> 07:42.329
before it closes.

07:42.362 --> 07:43.731
Anybody want a
ride in that truck?

07:43.764 --> 07:44.632
Yes, sure.

07:44.665 --> 07:45.533
Darlene?

07:45.566 --> 07:47.000
I don't think so.

07:47.034 --> 07:48.702
Oh, go on, Darlene.
Get out of the house.

07:48.736 --> 07:50.037
It'll be fun.

07:50.070 --> 07:54.041
You can roll down the window
and spit into convertibles.

07:54.074 --> 07:56.276
All right.

07:56.309 --> 07:57.845
[doorbell ringing]
- OK.

07:57.878 --> 07:58.746
That's Kathy.

07:58.779 --> 07:59.813
OK?

07:59.847 --> 08:01.214
Now, I don't want
her to think that you

08:01.248 --> 08:03.551
was out there picking through
her trash so here's the deal.

08:03.584 --> 08:04.785
Here's the story, OK?

08:04.818 --> 08:09.623
We paid full price for that
dog at Rodbell's, $400.

08:09.657 --> 08:10.991
I thought they went for $200.

08:11.024 --> 08:12.192
Yeah.

08:12.225 --> 08:14.294
Well, we overpaid, you
know, on account of we're

08:14.327 --> 08:17.030
making a fortune at the shop.

08:17.064 --> 08:18.365
Got it, Lovey,
but do be quick.

08:18.398 --> 08:20.167
We dine with the
Snobheads at 8:00.

08:23.003 --> 08:24.037
Hi.

08:24.071 --> 08:25.939
Yeah, Jackie just
went out to move her--

08:25.973 --> 08:31.344
Roseanne, my house was robbed.

08:31.378 --> 08:32.445
Whoa.

08:32.479 --> 08:34.114
We were away for the
weekend and two guys

08:34.147 --> 08:36.183
dressed like good
samaritans just

08:36.216 --> 08:40.020
backed a van up to the
house and cleaned us out--

08:40.053 --> 08:43.056
in broad daylight.

08:43.090 --> 08:47.094
Oh, that-- that
is unbelievable.

08:47.127 --> 08:49.496
You-- you better sit down.

08:49.529 --> 08:51.999
Mr. Henderson said
he saw the entire thing

08:52.032 --> 08:53.433
from across the street
and didn't do a thing.

08:57.537 --> 09:00.140
What kind of a neighbor is that?

09:00.173 --> 09:01.141
That's a bad, bad neighbor.

09:04.011 --> 09:05.245
I feel so--

09:05.278 --> 09:06.446
so violated.

09:06.479 --> 09:08.115
Oh, sure you do.

09:08.148 --> 09:10.651
They took things that I've
been collecting for years.

09:10.684 --> 09:12.019
Oh, man.

09:12.052 --> 09:13.186
Oh, man.

09:13.220 --> 09:14.187
They took that stuff?

09:14.221 --> 09:15.555
That's really, really bad.

09:15.589 --> 09:19.960
Hey, if you're going to be mad
at anybody, be mad at them.

09:19.993 --> 09:21.695
The police will be coming
by to take statements,

09:21.729 --> 09:23.831
but I don't suppose you
saw anything, did you?

09:23.864 --> 09:24.798
No.

09:24.832 --> 09:26.266
No.
No.

09:26.299 --> 09:27.100
Well, yeah.

09:29.970 --> 09:32.640
What?

09:32.673 --> 09:34.407
Well, like they
seemed really nice.

09:34.441 --> 09:36.744
Like they called me ma'am
and everything, you know?

09:36.777 --> 09:40.313
Wait.
You spoke to the criminals?

09:44.251 --> 09:47.487
Well, haggled is more like it.

09:50.557 --> 09:53.193
Oh my god, that's
my umbrella stand.

09:53.226 --> 09:55.128
Umbrellas, of course.

10:00.367 --> 10:03.436
You-- you bought
this from the robbers?

10:03.470 --> 10:05.105
How could you do that?

10:05.138 --> 10:07.741
Didn't you look in
the truck, Roseanne?

10:07.775 --> 10:09.910
There was a big screen
TV in the truck.

10:09.943 --> 10:11.945
Do you think we
would have given away

10:11.979 --> 10:15.348
a brand new 45-inch
television to charity?

10:15.382 --> 10:18.051
Well, you know, it would
have been a nice gesture.

10:18.085 --> 10:20.487
I don't believe you, Roseanne.

10:20.520 --> 10:22.723
Calm down here.

10:22.756 --> 10:24.391
Hey, you know,
I'm really sorry,

10:24.424 --> 10:26.626
but I didn't know your house
was getting robbed or nothing.

10:26.660 --> 10:28.929
I mean, I thought I
was doing a good thing.

10:28.962 --> 10:31.298
I thought I was doing
something for charity.

10:31.331 --> 10:33.466
A good thing.

10:33.500 --> 10:35.468
It was a stupid thing, Roseanne.

10:35.502 --> 10:37.871
It was the stupidest thing
anybody has ever done

10:37.905 --> 10:41.942
and you are the stupidest
woman on the face of the Earth.

10:41.975 --> 10:43.210
Oh, yeah?

10:43.243 --> 10:46.046
I paid $20 for that piece
of crap and you paid $200.

10:46.079 --> 10:46.880
That's stupid.

10:58.391 --> 10:59.827
I was starting to
worry about you guys.

10:59.860 --> 11:01.094
You've been gone a long time.

11:01.128 --> 11:02.562
Yeah, you should have worried.

11:02.595 --> 11:04.765
Aunt Jackie almost killed us.

11:04.798 --> 11:07.300
Oh, she was just showing
us how well the rig cornered.

11:07.334 --> 11:10.704
She missed the bus
stop by almost a foot.

11:10.738 --> 11:13.841
Everybody there
dove under the bench.

11:13.874 --> 11:16.109
They were old, they panicked.

11:16.143 --> 11:18.011
It was so cool.

11:18.045 --> 11:19.046
[doorbell ringing]

11:19.079 --> 11:20.948
Well, I'm glad you
had fun, Darlene.

11:20.981 --> 11:21.849
Well,

11:21.882 --> 11:23.216
What about me?

11:23.250 --> 11:25.919
Well, it doesn't sound like
you had any fun at all, Becky.

11:25.953 --> 11:26.920
Hey, Jer.

11:26.954 --> 11:27.855
Hey, Dan.
Roseanne here?

11:27.888 --> 11:28.856
No.

11:28.889 --> 11:30.657
She's over at her
friend, Crystal's.

11:30.690 --> 11:31.658
- I wonder if we could talk.
- Sure.

11:31.691 --> 11:32.860
Want a beer?

11:32.893 --> 11:34.127
Definitely.

11:34.161 --> 11:36.329
Hey, I'm real sorry about
what happened to you guys.

11:36.363 --> 11:38.465
Well, you know, the insurance
should cover everything so--

11:38.498 --> 11:40.367
Well, that's good.

11:40.400 --> 11:41.201
Thanks.

11:44.104 --> 11:50.210
Dan, Kathy wants to put
up an electric fence.

11:50.243 --> 11:51.311
An

11:51.344 --> 11:52.679
Electric fence will
do you no good, Jerry.

11:52.712 --> 11:54.181
They're not going
to rob you again.

11:54.214 --> 11:58.451
Well, it's not for
burglars, it's for Roseanne.

11:58.485 --> 12:01.955
Electricity won't stop
her, Jer, I've tried.

12:01.989 --> 12:02.956
Not much of a swimmer, though.

12:02.990 --> 12:03.924
You might want to build a moat.

12:06.760 --> 12:08.161
I've got to do
something because she

12:08.195 --> 12:09.396
wants to move back to Chicago.

12:09.429 --> 12:10.297
Really?

12:10.330 --> 12:11.698
Yeah.

12:11.731 --> 12:13.200
Anything I can do?

12:13.233 --> 12:16.469
Could you get
Roseanne to apologize?

12:16.503 --> 12:18.005
When you do move can I
have your satellite dish?

12:21.909 --> 12:23.643
I can't leave
without something, Dan.

12:23.676 --> 12:28.381
I mean, she's making
my life miserable.

12:28.415 --> 12:30.550
Well, here.
Take the pooch, Jer.

12:33.120 --> 12:34.387
Roseanne was going
to return it anyway,

12:34.421 --> 12:36.056
but this way you get
it back in one piece.

12:36.089 --> 12:37.590
Great.
Thanks.

12:37.624 --> 12:38.725
Thanks.

12:38.758 --> 12:40.794
But Kathy sort of had
this idea that we should

12:40.828 --> 12:42.529
start a neighborhood watch.

12:42.562 --> 12:44.064
Well, I thought that's
what happened, Jerry.

12:44.097 --> 12:45.465
You got robbed on the
neighborhood watch.

12:54.407 --> 12:55.275
Morning.

12:55.308 --> 12:57.610
Hey, Leon.

12:57.644 --> 12:58.611
So?

12:58.645 --> 12:59.546
What?

12:59.579 --> 13:01.114
So, you know, fill me in.

13:01.148 --> 13:02.715
How's your mom
handling everything?

13:02.749 --> 13:03.851
Fine, fine.

13:03.884 --> 13:06.053
Plane was a little late,
but everything else

13:06.086 --> 13:08.956
was fine, thank you.

13:08.989 --> 13:09.857
[kicking door]

13:11.992 --> 13:12.860
Whoa.

13:12.893 --> 13:14.527
We better stay ouf of his way.

13:14.561 --> 13:16.830
That won't be no fun.

13:16.864 --> 13:18.598
Roseanne, remember
what happened yesterday?

13:18.631 --> 13:20.633
Now, we need to just
mind our own business.

13:20.667 --> 13:22.235
Bonnie, if I'm going
to mind my own business,

13:22.269 --> 13:23.303
I wouldn't have came in early.

13:37.985 --> 13:39.486
What?

13:39.519 --> 13:41.021
Well, maybe you
want to talk about it.

13:43.991 --> 13:44.858
Only got a minute.

13:44.892 --> 13:46.459
Go.

13:46.493 --> 13:47.727
Roseanne--

13:47.760 --> 13:49.562
Well, there you are,
taking a little coffee break.

13:49.596 --> 13:50.630
I thought you went back to work.

13:50.663 --> 13:51.865
No, I am working.

13:51.899 --> 13:54.234
I'm talking to Roseanna,
and believe me, that's work.

13:54.267 --> 13:57.804
Ran away, left me
alone with Mother.

14:00.640 --> 14:02.809
Don't you call her that.

14:05.412 --> 14:07.047
I will never be good
enough for that woman.

14:07.080 --> 14:08.681
All she does is
pick, pick, pick.

14:08.715 --> 14:10.717
Hey, you wanted a
mother-in-law, buddy boy.

14:10.750 --> 14:12.652
Now you've got one.
Where is she now?

14:12.685 --> 14:15.422
- In housewares.
- Oh, you just left her there?

14:15.455 --> 14:16.356
I don't believe this.

14:16.389 --> 14:18.158
Know what she's doing?

14:18.191 --> 14:19.659
She's buying us a waffle iron.

14:19.692 --> 14:20.660
Oh, my.

14:20.693 --> 14:22.095
Let's have her arrested.

14:22.129 --> 14:23.296
We don't eat waffles, Leon.

14:23.330 --> 14:25.098
That's because
you don't make them.

14:25.132 --> 14:26.833
I don't see you lifting
a finger in the kitchen.

14:26.866 --> 14:27.834
Excuse me.

14:27.867 --> 14:28.902
I work all day.

14:28.936 --> 14:30.103
Oh, and I don't?

14:30.137 --> 14:31.404
You're little bookstore.

14:31.438 --> 14:32.973
I happen to own
that bookstore, Leon.

14:33.006 --> 14:34.274
Yes, I know.

14:34.307 --> 14:37.110
Wisely located right next
door to the public library.

14:37.144 --> 14:38.511
I told you not
to bring that up.

14:38.545 --> 14:41.648
Oh, I'm allowed because if I
hadn't sunk my life's savings

14:41.681 --> 14:43.350
into your little brain
child, I wouldn't

14:43.383 --> 14:44.317
be working in this dump.

14:44.351 --> 14:45.152
Hello.

14:48.221 --> 14:50.057
- I hate you, Leon.
- I hate you more.

14:53.893 --> 14:56.363
Well, I'll just
be up in housewares.

15:05.438 --> 15:06.473
I would so.

15:06.506 --> 15:08.808
I would absolutely
tell Mom if I was gay.

15:08.841 --> 15:10.010
Oh, sure.

15:10.043 --> 15:11.644
You couldn't tell her you
were going to be a cop.

15:11.678 --> 15:13.780
How could you tell
her you were gay?

15:13.813 --> 15:17.850
Easy, it'd kill her.

15:17.884 --> 15:19.186
Oh, yeah.

15:19.219 --> 15:20.787
Of course.

15:20.820 --> 15:22.655
Well, what if,
say, DJ was gay?

15:22.689 --> 15:23.991
I mean, would you
want him to tell you?

15:24.024 --> 15:25.092
Well, of course
I would Jackie.

15:25.125 --> 15:27.127
I don't want him keeping
no secrets from me.

15:27.160 --> 15:28.161
You wouldn't mind?

15:28.195 --> 15:29.262
No.

15:29.296 --> 15:30.897
The only thing I've
ever wanted for my kids

15:30.930 --> 15:35.402
is that they're happy and
that they're out of the house.

15:35.435 --> 15:38.205
And I'll tell you what, happy
ain't even that important.

15:41.541 --> 15:42.442
How about you, Dan?

15:42.475 --> 15:44.377
How would you feel
if DJ was gay?

15:44.411 --> 15:45.312
Not gonna happen.

15:45.345 --> 15:46.213
Well, I know.

15:46.246 --> 15:47.114
I'm just saying.

15:47.147 --> 15:48.048
Hey, not gonna happen.

15:51.284 --> 15:53.953
Oh, you winged him.

15:53.987 --> 15:54.854
DJ: I got it.

15:54.887 --> 15:56.489
What's Dan's problem?

15:56.523 --> 15:58.625
Oh, you know,
DJ's his only son

15:58.658 --> 16:01.394
and he's got that
thing where he wants

16:01.428 --> 16:03.463
DJ to carry on the Conner name.

16:03.496 --> 16:06.799
You know, I told him Becky would
probably have a couple of kids

16:06.833 --> 16:08.935
before she was married
and they'd be Connors.

16:08.968 --> 16:11.771
I bet that'd be comforting.

16:11.804 --> 16:12.705
DJ: Mom?

16:12.739 --> 16:13.540
What?

16:16.076 --> 16:18.111
Roseanne, this
is Officer Robbins.

16:18.145 --> 16:19.412
He's here to take
your statement.

16:19.446 --> 16:21.281
Just tell him the truth.

16:21.314 --> 16:22.615
I'm sure he'll go easy on you.

16:22.649 --> 16:23.516
Hiya, gill.

16:23.550 --> 16:24.651
How you doing?

16:24.684 --> 16:25.485
Hey, Rosie.

16:28.788 --> 16:29.922
You know each other?

16:29.956 --> 16:30.823
Oh, yeah.

16:30.857 --> 16:32.359
We went to high school together.

16:32.392 --> 16:34.661
I don't believe this town.

16:34.694 --> 16:36.329
This is a real pill
you've get living

16:36.363 --> 16:37.264
next door to you, Roseanne.

16:37.297 --> 16:38.131
Yeah.

16:38.165 --> 16:40.600
Tell me about it, man.

16:40.633 --> 16:41.801
OK, Rosie.

16:41.834 --> 16:44.404
Mrs. Bowman says that you
saw one of the robbers.

16:44.437 --> 16:45.338
Uh-huh.

16:45.372 --> 16:47.374
Could you give
us a description?

16:47.407 --> 16:49.142
Yeah.

16:49.176 --> 16:50.977
Well, do you remember
what Jimmy Mullins

16:51.010 --> 16:52.479
looked like in high school?

16:52.512 --> 16:54.214
Because he kind of
looked like that.

16:54.247 --> 16:55.815
But you don't think it
was Jimmy, now, do you?

16:55.848 --> 16:57.050
Oh, no, no, no.

16:57.084 --> 16:59.519
This guy's nose was
like way more scoopier,

16:59.552 --> 17:01.354
kind of like Bob Hope's nose.

17:01.388 --> 17:02.822
But definitely not Jimmy.

17:02.855 --> 17:03.723
Oh, no.

17:03.756 --> 17:04.724
Uh-uh, no, Jimmy.

17:04.757 --> 17:07.260
Good.

17:07.294 --> 17:09.329
Good?

17:09.362 --> 17:10.563
What do we have here?

17:10.597 --> 17:14.567
So far we've eliminated
Jimmy Mullins and Bob Hope.

17:14.601 --> 17:15.802
Well, I didn't see the driver.

17:15.835 --> 17:18.805
That could have been Bob Hope.

17:18.838 --> 17:20.273
Hey, you want a beer, Gill?

17:20.307 --> 17:21.174
Sure.

17:21.208 --> 17:22.175
Yeah.

17:22.209 --> 17:24.811
Aren't you on duty?

17:24.844 --> 17:27.880
Never mind, Rosie.

17:27.914 --> 17:29.949
Please just get on with this.

17:29.982 --> 17:30.950
OK, Rosie.

17:30.983 --> 17:32.419
You got a description
of the vehicle?

17:32.452 --> 17:34.554
Well, just that it was a
blue truck with one of these--

17:34.587 --> 17:35.955
Jackie, oh.

17:35.988 --> 17:37.257
Gill, how you been?

17:40.160 --> 17:41.328
Hey, I miss you guys.

17:41.361 --> 17:43.730
Oh, I miss you guys, too.
What's been going on?

17:43.763 --> 17:44.897
Nothing, just real quite.

17:44.931 --> 17:46.499
Let me tell you what I did.
I've been looking--

17:46.533 --> 17:48.201
Excuse me, could we
please focus on the fact

17:48.235 --> 17:51.204
that my house has been robbed?
- God, you're so rude.

17:54.040 --> 17:57.744
What do I have to do to get
a little justice around here?

17:57.777 --> 17:59.912
I would suggest you get
a security system or a dog

17:59.946 --> 18:01.681
and maybe talk to your
neighbors once in a while,

18:01.714 --> 18:03.516
let them know when
you're out of town.

18:03.550 --> 18:04.917
Hey, Gill.

18:04.951 --> 18:05.818
Danny.

18:05.852 --> 18:06.986
Oh.

18:07.019 --> 18:09.021
Want a beer?

18:09.055 --> 18:09.922
May I?

18:09.956 --> 18:11.458
Oh, go ahead.

18:11.491 --> 18:13.460
Gill, listen, I got my
trucking license today.

18:13.493 --> 18:15.628
Yeah, so I figured you
and I can talk on the CB

18:15.662 --> 18:17.330
and you can tell me where
all the radar traps are.

18:17.364 --> 18:18.165
Cool.

18:23.236 --> 18:25.672
I'm in hell.

18:25.705 --> 18:28.241
Nah, you're just in Lanford.

18:28.275 --> 18:31.711
Same zip code, though.

18:31.744 --> 18:33.480
You want a beer?

18:33.513 --> 18:36.316
No, I don't.

18:36.349 --> 18:42.822
What I want is not
to live here anymore.

18:42.855 --> 18:44.757
You know, Kathy, I
just want you to know I--

18:44.791 --> 18:48.861
I sure am sorry
about what happened.

18:48.895 --> 18:51.798
You know, Lanford's not a bad
town, you've just gotta go

18:51.831 --> 18:55.268
with it more, you know, fit in.

18:55.302 --> 18:57.704
And what does
that mean, Roseanne?

18:57.737 --> 18:59.739
Am I supposed to
wander around town

18:59.772 --> 19:02.342
in a tacky housecoat
and flip-flops

19:02.375 --> 19:03.376
with my hair in curlers?

19:06.446 --> 19:09.516
Now you're getting it.

19:09.549 --> 19:10.917
Yeah, absolutely.

19:10.950 --> 19:13.052
And then I'll throw
us one of these here

19:13.085 --> 19:14.954
Tupperware parties you
know and then I can

19:14.987 --> 19:16.989
introduce you to the others.

19:21.994 --> 19:23.162
What are you talking about?

19:23.196 --> 19:26.933
Oh, we all used to
be like you, Kathy--

19:26.966 --> 19:29.702
angry, bitter, annoying.

19:29.736 --> 19:32.372
But now we're the Lanford Wives.

19:35.942 --> 19:37.009
Goodbye, Roseanne.

19:37.043 --> 19:40.012
Oh, it's useless to
try to resist us, Kathy.

19:40.046 --> 19:41.481
We already have Jerry.

19:41.514 --> 19:42.382
Jerry's one of us.

19:45.485 --> 19:48.488
Jerry joined the lodge.

19:48.521 --> 19:50.156
You're a sick woman, Roseanne.

19:50.189 --> 19:51.891
Oh, you'll start to love it.

19:51.924 --> 19:53.159
I promise, Kathy.

19:53.192 --> 19:54.327
Just think about it--

19:54.361 --> 19:57.129
swap meets, bowling
leagues, bingo,

19:57.163 --> 20:01.434
double coupon days, casino
night at the slaughterhouse.

20:01.468 --> 20:02.269
It's your destiny.

20:13.280 --> 20:15.114
Maybe we should
check the house, Jer.

20:15.147 --> 20:15.948
Checking.

20:19.018 --> 20:19.886
Still there.

20:19.919 --> 20:21.020
Great.

20:21.053 --> 20:23.590
Doing a hell of a job.

20:23.623 --> 20:27.560
So, Jer, uh, if you
don't mind, I'd like

20:27.594 --> 20:28.695
to ask you a person question.

20:28.728 --> 20:30.229
You don't have to answer
it if you don't want to.

20:30.263 --> 20:32.865
She's just not happy
here in Lanford, Dan.

20:32.899 --> 20:34.166
Unfortunately, that's
the side of her

20:34.200 --> 20:35.167
that you and Rosie get to see.

20:35.201 --> 20:36.403
Got it.

20:36.436 --> 20:38.671
Behind closed doors she
shows a whole other side.

20:38.705 --> 20:39.906
Got it.

20:39.939 --> 20:42.041
Did you know that there
have actually been mornings

20:42.074 --> 20:44.344
when I've woken up dehydrated?

20:47.614 --> 20:49.849
Yep, that's what
Rosie figured.

20:49.882 --> 20:53.219
Have a beer, Jer.

20:53.252 --> 20:54.987
[sirens]

20:55.021 --> 20:57.424
What do you think?

20:57.457 --> 21:00.627
Three blocks away, maybe four.

21:00.660 --> 21:01.894
Not our jurisdiction.

21:10.136 --> 21:11.304
ROSEANNE: No, that's not him.

21:17.109 --> 21:18.010
That's not him, either.

21:23.015 --> 21:23.816
Uh-uh.

21:28.488 --> 21:29.288
Too tall.

21:39.732 --> 21:41.200
That's him!

21:41.233 --> 21:44.871
The guy who looks
like Jimmy Mullins.
