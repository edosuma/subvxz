14:50.500 --> 14:52.791
[crowd laughing]

14:57.625 --> 15:01.000
[girls giggling]

15:01.083 --> 15:02.958
[Hannah] You're completely mad.

15:03.791 --> 15:04.791
[Sarah] No…

15:06.041 --> 15:07.958
I'm just not afraid with you.

15:09.625 --> 15:11.875
[both giggling]

15:18.041 --> 15:19.625
We should go back.

15:24.125 --> 15:25.000
Should we?

15:41.291 --> 15:42.416
[Sarah] We can't.

15:42.500 --> 15:43.916
This is wrong.

15:45.916 --> 15:47.166
Doesn't feel wrong.

15:51.250 --> 15:53.916
[Sarah breathing heavily]

15:56.875 --> 15:58.708
Tell me to stop and I shall.

16:11.083 --> 16:12.750
[heavy breathing]

16:31.541 --> 16:34.500
[breathing heavily]

16:35.291 --> 16:36.500
[twig snaps]

16:36.583 --> 16:38.666
[gasping] What was that?

16:38.750 --> 16:39.875
[twig snaps]

16:44.041 --> 16:45.750
[ominous music playing]

16:48.583 --> 16:49.666
[Hannah] Someone was there.

16:49.750 --> 16:50.958
Someone saw us.

16:51.041 --> 16:52.416
They couldn't.

16:52.500 --> 16:54.500
What if it was the widow or Caleb?

16:54.583 --> 16:56.916
Caleb can barely find his own member.

16:57.666 --> 16:59.666
But if he saw us, if he tells--

16:59.750 --> 17:01.750
That spoiled piglet doesn't scare me.

17:01.833 --> 17:03.958
They'll hang us, Sarah.

17:05.375 --> 17:07.041
Well, let them hang us then.

17:08.291 --> 17:11.583
I was not alive before now anyway.

17:16.875 --> 17:19.208
[Mad Thomas laughing]

17:19.916 --> 17:22.083
Sinners, sinners.

17:22.166 --> 17:23.458
[grunting]

17:38.416 --> 17:39.375
[gasps]

17:42.125 --> 17:43.250
[inhales deeply]

17:44.291 --> 17:45.958
[exhales slowly]

17:47.583 --> 17:50.541
[soft banging]

17:53.166 --> 17:55.041
[creaking]

18:00.333 --> 18:02.208
-[dog barks]
-[Sarah gasps]

18:02.291 --> 18:04.833
[laughing] Oh, damn you, Merryboy!

18:06.375 --> 18:07.833
Get in, you brute.

18:09.708 --> 18:11.458
[eerie music playing]

18:18.958 --> 18:20.958
-[Henry] Sarah! It's half six.
-[gasps]

18:21.041 --> 18:23.666
You've overslept.
I've done most of the morning work.

18:24.500 --> 18:26.125
All right. [sighs]

18:27.875 --> 18:28.958
I'm coming.

18:31.500 --> 18:32.625
[Sarah sighs]

18:42.708 --> 18:43.916
[chuckles quietly]

18:45.166 --> 18:46.166
[Sarah] Merryboy!

18:48.041 --> 18:49.958
Merryboy, time to eat!

18:54.166 --> 18:55.541
Oh, where are you, dog?

18:59.250 --> 19:00.333
Merryboy?

19:04.416 --> 19:06.416
[suspenseful music playing]

19:15.333 --> 19:16.583
-Merryboy?
-[Hannah] Sarah?

19:17.375 --> 19:19.250
[gasping] Oh, heavens.

19:19.916 --> 19:21.041
You scared me.

19:22.958 --> 19:24.791
There's something wrong with my father.

19:25.291 --> 19:28.958
[whispering] The voice shall sing.
Order's furnace beckons now.

19:29.791 --> 19:31.791
To be freed, to be released.

19:31.875 --> 19:33.125
What is he saying?

19:33.208 --> 19:34.458
[indistinct whispering]

19:34.541 --> 19:35.375
I don't know.

19:35.458 --> 19:37.500
[whispering] The voice shall soon become.

19:39.833 --> 19:41.625
[whispering voice] Cyrus…

19:41.708 --> 19:43.625
[fly buzzing]

19:45.583 --> 19:46.708
[Sarah] When did this start?

19:46.791 --> 19:48.208
[Hannah] Just this morning.

19:48.291 --> 19:49.708
He's distracted,

19:50.291 --> 19:52.208
listening to things only he can hear.

19:52.791 --> 19:54.041
Perhaps it is prayer?

19:54.583 --> 19:55.666
[sighs] No.

19:56.666 --> 19:58.166
No, something is…

20:00.541 --> 20:01.708
wrong.

20:02.916 --> 20:04.875
I look in his eyes and it's as if…

20:08.333 --> 20:12.708
As if something crawled in from the night
and put on Father's skin.

20:13.916 --> 20:15.500
It looks like him, but…

20:17.583 --> 20:19.750
-[whispering]
-[Hannah] He's not himself, Sarah.

20:21.083 --> 20:23.083
Mother's gone to the meeting house.

20:23.583 --> 20:25.958
She says we must ask God,

20:26.041 --> 20:28.000
but I don't know which Psalm,

20:29.291 --> 20:30.375
what passage--

20:30.458 --> 20:33.833
He needs proper medicine, Hannah.

20:34.750 --> 20:37.083
-I will talk to your mother.
-No!

20:37.958 --> 20:39.666
She can't know you were here.

20:42.416 --> 20:44.541
I'm not to see you anymore.

20:44.625 --> 20:46.500
[melancholic music playing]

20:47.958 --> 20:49.125
Not to see me?

20:50.000 --> 20:51.583
She suspects us, Sarah.

20:55.125 --> 20:56.375
She suspects our…

20:59.458 --> 21:00.750
wickedness.

21:01.458 --> 21:03.291
And now Father is sick.

21:04.000 --> 21:05.083
Do you think…

21:08.041 --> 21:09.375
Did we cause it?

21:13.041 --> 21:14.041
[Sarah] Hannah…

21:15.500 --> 21:17.416
Everything will be all right.

21:20.083 --> 21:21.333
[door bangs]

21:23.291 --> 21:25.625
You! You!

21:25.708 --> 21:28.416
You won't stop until you've
completely ruined her life, will you?

21:28.500 --> 21:30.625
-Mother!
-You shut your mouth!

21:30.708 --> 21:33.333
Thomas saw you last night in town!

21:33.416 --> 21:37.583
He's telling everyone! How dare you
bring this filth into our home!

21:38.166 --> 21:40.333
I see what you really are, girl.

21:40.416 --> 21:43.000
An abomination corrupting my daughter.

21:43.083 --> 21:44.833
Born of perversion!

21:44.916 --> 21:46.583
Goody Miller, please!

21:48.458 --> 21:49.500
[Sarah squeals]

21:50.791 --> 21:52.875
God knows what you are, girl!

21:52.958 --> 21:56.125
You'd better pray for mercy
on your damned soul!

22:02.708 --> 22:04.208
[breathing heavily]

22:22.083 --> 22:27.666
[father] Sarah, Thomas has been talking.
There something you want to tell me?

22:28.250 --> 22:29.250
[gasps]

22:29.791 --> 22:30.708
No.

22:30.791 --> 22:33.000
I heard you come home late last night.

22:36.125 --> 22:38.375
You were out
with the pastor's daughter, weren't you?

22:39.041 --> 22:40.250
And Abbi.

22:41.333 --> 22:42.416
And Lizzie and…

22:43.750 --> 22:44.708
the others.

22:46.125 --> 22:48.125
[father] If your mother was still alive…

22:52.833 --> 22:56.208
You know, it was your mother
who convinced us to settle this land.

22:58.166 --> 23:01.583
She was wise enough to understand
this land was special.

23:02.708 --> 23:04.958
She said she could feel it in the air.

23:06.541 --> 23:07.541
The lake.

23:09.500 --> 23:10.375
The woods.

23:11.458 --> 23:12.958
So we put down roots…

23:15.791 --> 23:17.416
and made up our own Eden here.

23:18.666 --> 23:20.041
She was a good woman.

23:22.208 --> 23:24.875
And I fear in her absence…

23:26.166 --> 23:27.250
I have failed her.

23:29.125 --> 23:30.458
I have failed you both.

23:31.500 --> 23:32.500
Father…

23:34.541 --> 23:38.166
There has always been
a strangeness in you, Sarah.

23:38.250 --> 23:39.625
A streak…

23:40.208 --> 23:42.916
Something perhaps
a mother could have rooted out,

23:43.583 --> 23:45.416
but you were raised like a boy.

23:45.916 --> 23:47.708
I gave you too much freedom,

23:48.291 --> 23:49.708
and now it is too late.

23:51.875 --> 23:53.291
It's my fault.

23:55.333 --> 23:56.333
[Sarah] Father…

23:59.708 --> 24:02.791
[flies buzzing]

24:09.208 --> 24:11.208
[ominous music playing]

24:13.125 --> 24:14.916
[flies buzzing]

24:27.208 --> 24:28.666
[gasps]

24:32.583 --> 24:33.666
[Henry shouts] Sarah!

24:36.666 --> 24:38.125
[Sarah] What is it? What's wrong?

24:38.625 --> 24:40.750
[pig grunting]

24:40.833 --> 24:42.041
[Henry] The babes are gone.

24:43.916 --> 24:44.916
She ate them.

24:48.458 --> 24:49.541
She ate them all.

24:50.125 --> 24:51.916
[pig grunting]

24:53.958 --> 24:55.416
Bring me the ax, Henry.

24:55.500 --> 24:56.375
Sarah…

24:56.458 --> 24:57.500
The ax!

25:05.000 --> 25:06.583
[dramatic music playing]

25:15.625 --> 25:17.041
[pig grunting]

25:19.541 --> 25:20.625
[pig squeals]

25:21.375 --> 25:23.083
[retching]

25:23.708 --> 25:25.041
[sighs deeply]

25:32.666 --> 25:34.166
[Mad Thomas] The dark one has come

25:34.666 --> 25:37.833
to harvest the bitter fruit
of the evil we have sown.

25:39.750 --> 25:41.500
To feast on our misdeeds.

25:41.583 --> 25:43.208
[whinnying]

25:44.041 --> 25:45.791
[Mad Thomas] And yet you all smile,

25:47.625 --> 25:50.000
blind to the horrors around us.

25:51.500 --> 25:53.750
But you see it now, don't you?

25:55.041 --> 25:56.625
He blocks our well,

25:57.291 --> 25:58.583
clogs it with our sin.

25:58.666 --> 25:59.958
[man 1] It's stuck!

26:00.750 --> 26:03.000
He takes our water.
He takes our life blood!

26:03.083 --> 26:04.458
[Sarah] What's happened?

26:04.541 --> 26:07.250
-What's going on here?
-The bucket's caught on something.

26:07.750 --> 26:10.333
[men grunting]

26:12.416 --> 26:14.375
-[man 2] It rises!
-[man 1] Yeah. Let go.

26:14.458 --> 26:15.500
It's coming!

26:16.083 --> 26:17.083
It rises!

26:21.875 --> 26:23.333
A dead dog in the well!

26:23.416 --> 26:24.416
[screams]

26:24.500 --> 26:26.875
-[man 1] Get it out!
-Our water! It's poisoned!

26:28.458 --> 26:31.041
[Thomas] See? You have already drunk
from the cup of darkness.

26:31.125 --> 26:32.333
[Sarah] Merryboy…

26:32.416 --> 26:33.750
[gasping]

26:33.833 --> 26:37.375
This is the work of the Devil.
He has come to stake our land.

26:38.708 --> 26:41.041
Who among you has welcomed
the Devil to Union?

26:43.000 --> 26:44.000
Whose lust?

26:44.500 --> 26:45.500
Whose sin?

26:46.666 --> 26:48.333
Oh, foolish Union.

26:49.500 --> 26:50.583
The Devil has come

26:52.000 --> 26:53.958
and cast his darkness over us.

26:55.916 --> 26:57.291
And his darkness grows

26:58.333 --> 26:59.500
within each of us

27:00.875 --> 27:02.041
like a rot.

27:03.625 --> 27:04.583
[chuckles]

27:14.500 --> 27:15.791
[knocking on door]

27:19.166 --> 27:20.750
[relieved sigh]

27:20.833 --> 27:21.875
Solomon…

27:21.958 --> 27:25.916
I didn't mean to stop by unexpected.

27:26.000 --> 27:27.541
I have just a, uh…

27:30.166 --> 27:31.875
a small thank you.

27:36.916 --> 27:37.916
It's for Sarah.

27:41.958 --> 27:42.958
What is it?

27:43.958 --> 27:45.250
Can you keep a secret?

27:46.333 --> 27:49.250
And that's when I saw
something in the trees.

27:49.333 --> 27:50.708
A figure.

27:52.000 --> 27:52.958
Who was it?

27:53.041 --> 27:54.708
I don't know. It was so dark.

27:55.416 --> 27:57.291
I thought it was Caleb or…

27:57.958 --> 27:59.083
or the widow.

28:00.083 --> 28:01.166
But now…

28:01.250 --> 28:02.500
What?

28:09.375 --> 28:10.708
Now we are tormented

28:10.791 --> 28:12.583
and the pastor is sick and…

28:13.166 --> 28:16.250
and I feel half mad, and now I wonder

28:16.750 --> 28:20.625
if perhaps something is wrong with me.

28:20.708 --> 28:23.208
-Sarah--
-And always has been, Solomon.

28:24.125 --> 28:26.625
I was never normal. My own father said so.

28:28.416 --> 28:31.041
Maybe I was born wicked

28:31.625 --> 28:32.958
and strange.

28:34.166 --> 28:36.791
Maybe it was the Devil in the woods.

28:36.875 --> 28:37.875
[gasps]

28:38.666 --> 28:40.375
Maybe the Devil is in me.

28:40.458 --> 28:42.416
Stop! You sound like Mad Thomas.

28:42.500 --> 28:44.000
Perhaps Thomas is right.

28:44.083 --> 28:46.583
Thomas is a mindless drunk, nothing more.

28:46.666 --> 28:49.916
Look around, Solomon.
There is blight everywhere.

28:50.000 --> 28:52.583
I… I… I grant you that, but you…

28:54.083 --> 28:57.833
Hannah was just a dalliance, Sarah.

28:59.250 --> 29:00.625
And if it wasn't?

29:05.041 --> 29:06.125
What do you mean?

29:09.791 --> 29:11.500
That's why I'm so afraid.

29:13.791 --> 29:14.916
Do you understand?

29:16.791 --> 29:17.750
[Sarah gasps]

29:18.458 --> 29:21.041
[crying] Because it was not
just a dalliance.

29:24.041 --> 29:26.000
[melancholic music playing]

29:31.708 --> 29:32.750
I see.

29:35.375 --> 29:37.333
I can't breathe. [gasps]

29:41.291 --> 29:42.291
Listen to me…

29:45.291 --> 29:48.375
[Sarah breathes heavily]

29:48.458 --> 29:51.083
Dalliance or not…

29:53.708 --> 29:55.916
one does not summon the Devil by chance.

29:56.000 --> 29:57.541
Even the weakest heart,

29:58.208 --> 30:00.125
the most corruptible soul,

30:00.625 --> 30:01.875
they must make the choice.

30:01.958 --> 30:03.583
They must extend their hand,

30:05.125 --> 30:06.541
which you did not do.

30:08.208 --> 30:09.500
-No.
-No.

30:14.875 --> 30:17.125
You can always come to me, Sarah.

30:17.708 --> 30:19.625
My door is always open to you.

30:22.666 --> 30:24.125
[girl screaming]

30:25.958 --> 30:28.708
-Cyrus! Come out!
-[crowd shouting]

30:28.791 --> 30:30.875
Constance! Where is Constance?

30:30.958 --> 30:34.750
-The Devil has locked himself in there!
-[man 1] Pastor! Pastor!

30:35.500 --> 30:37.291
-Brother! What's happening?
-The pastor.

30:37.375 --> 30:40.375
He's locked the children
in the Meeting House. A dozen at least.

30:40.458 --> 30:41.958
Henry! Where is Henry?

30:42.041 --> 30:43.625
[indistinct yelling]

30:47.916 --> 30:48.916
Solomon!

30:53.708 --> 30:54.625
Cyrus!

30:55.958 --> 30:56.916
[grunts]

30:59.791 --> 31:00.833

31:03.625 --> 31:07.625
-[grunting]
-[banging]

31:17.625 --> 31:19.083
Keep everyone back.

31:20.125 --> 31:21.458
Solomon, wait!

31:26.416 --> 31:28.083
Let me in! No!

31:28.166 --> 31:29.291
[man 2] Stay back.

31:30.875 --> 31:32.708
[Sarah] Henry! Henry!

31:33.333 --> 31:37.625
[Pastor Miller mumbling] Because they are.
We call upon which they call within.

31:37.708 --> 31:40.041
Resigned to deficit.

31:40.125 --> 31:41.875
-Where's my husband?
-[man 3] Hold them back!

31:41.958 --> 31:43.750
What's happening in there?

31:43.833 --> 31:47.708
-Let me go! Let me go! Cyrus!
-Constance!

31:47.791 --> 31:50.958
[Pastor Miller mumbling indistinctly]

31:52.041 --> 31:53.250
[metal bang]

31:55.291 --> 31:56.333
[metal bang]

31:56.416 --> 31:58.333
-[pastor mumbling]
-[fly buzzing]

31:58.416 --> 31:59.583
[Solomon] Cyrus?

32:01.583 --> 32:05.041
[metal banging]

32:05.125 --> 32:06.708
[fly buzzing]

32:11.333 --> 32:14.541
[banging]

32:16.375 --> 32:19.541
[banging faster]

32:22.958 --> 32:24.291
[Pastor Miller] I can see now.

32:24.375 --> 32:25.958
I can see everything.

32:38.625 --> 32:39.666
[door crashes open]

32:39.750 --> 32:40.916
[crowd] Our children!

32:41.958 --> 32:43.125
Our children!

32:43.208 --> 32:45.458
[crowd shouting]

32:47.791 --> 32:49.000
[screaming] No!

32:49.083 --> 32:51.958
[crying]

32:54.125 --> 32:55.375
[screams]

32:56.666 --> 32:58.083
[Sarah screams]

32:58.166 --> 32:59.375
Henry!

32:59.458 --> 33:02.041
[Sarah gasping]

33:04.083 --> 33:05.708
[Solomon] Sarah!

33:05.791 --> 33:06.833
Cyrus, no!

33:08.750 --> 33:10.333
[whimpering]

33:11.458 --> 33:12.375
No!

33:15.250 --> 33:17.541
Witchcraft! Witchcraft!

33:18.250 --> 33:20.333
Evil! Show yourself!

33:20.416 --> 33:22.375
-Witchcraft!
-[Thomas] Show yourself!

33:24.666 --> 33:26.375
[Thomas] Show yourself!

33:26.458 --> 33:28.083
[ominous music playing]

33:40.625 --> 33:43.416
[man 1] Hear ye! Hear ye!

33:44.000 --> 33:45.916
Good people of Union, listen!

33:46.000 --> 33:48.416
-[banging pulpit]
-There is a dark

33:48.500 --> 33:50.666
and evil force at work here.

33:50.750 --> 33:52.083
If we are ever to end this misery…

33:52.166 --> 33:53.208
Aye!

33:53.291 --> 33:55.833
…then we must root out the guilty.

33:55.916 --> 33:57.916
-We must--
-[Solomon] Jakob! Please, Goodman Berman!

33:58.000 --> 34:00.916
The man responsible is dead.

34:01.000 --> 34:03.416
-Pastor Miller--
-[Jakob] The pastor…

34:03.500 --> 34:05.958
Our pastor was a man of God.

34:06.041 --> 34:08.500
-[crowd] Right.
-[Jakob] And this was not him!

34:08.583 --> 34:11.458
-He was possessed by a darkness.
-[crowd] Yes!

34:11.541 --> 34:15.958
My child, my dear Constance,
and many others…

34:16.875 --> 34:18.166
are dead.

34:18.250 --> 34:20.833
-Our futures…
-[crows cawing]

34:20.916 --> 34:24.541
…many of our entire bloodlines
have been stolen from us.

34:25.416 --> 34:27.166
Someone must pay!

34:27.250 --> 34:29.666
[assenting]

34:31.375 --> 34:35.416
I saw some little lambs of our town…

34:36.500 --> 34:39.416
laughing, dallying on the full moon last!

34:39.500 --> 34:41.541
[crowd shouting]

34:41.625 --> 34:44.750
There were some of us in the woods,
but there was no…

34:46.333 --> 34:49.083
We drank Apple Jack. We danced.

34:49.583 --> 34:52.166
We are young. That is not a crime!

34:52.666 --> 34:53.583
Heathens!

34:53.666 --> 34:56.208
You have sinned! You have sinned!

34:57.208 --> 34:58.750
Look upon your children!

34:59.875 --> 35:02.000
For they will bear the Devil's mark!

35:02.583 --> 35:03.541
[crowd shouting]

35:03.625 --> 35:04.958
[Elijah] Witchcraft!

35:05.541 --> 35:07.541
-Witchcraft!
-[crowd shouting]

35:07.625 --> 35:09.541
[Elijah] Yes, witchcraft.

35:10.791 --> 35:13.250
But just as my brother Solomon

35:13.333 --> 35:16.416
heroically expelled the darkness among us

35:16.500 --> 35:19.125
by killing our afflicted pastor,

35:19.208 --> 35:22.666
we too will punish and surmount this evil!

35:22.750 --> 35:24.041
Yes, we will!

35:24.125 --> 35:29.541
As survivors, our faces always will remain
toward the sun.

35:29.625 --> 35:31.750
[shouting] Hear, hear!

35:37.750 --> 35:39.958
[watchman] I traced it on my patrol!

35:40.958 --> 35:45.666
This scourge centers on Union proper.

35:45.750 --> 35:46.583
[woman] He's right!

35:46.666 --> 35:49.916
I've searched the woods.
It does not extend beyond the settlement.

35:50.000 --> 35:51.083
[woman whispers] He's right.

35:51.958 --> 35:53.791
[watchman] It's here! It's in Union!

35:55.041 --> 35:59.750
We are being punished,
and I have a list of names!

35:59.833 --> 36:02.708
Oh, then show it to us! Show it to us!

36:02.791 --> 36:05.500
Enough! Enough!

36:05.583 --> 36:07.458
Listen to yourselves!

36:08.541 --> 36:09.875
Speculation!

36:11.333 --> 36:13.375
Chasing shadows!

36:13.458 --> 36:15.166
Imagined curses!

36:16.916 --> 36:18.208
I ask…

36:18.291 --> 36:19.833
do you have proof?

36:21.000 --> 36:22.625
No. Or you?

36:25.375 --> 36:27.083
Or any of you?

36:29.500 --> 36:30.666
I have proof!

36:34.208 --> 36:39.791
It was some nights back when the full moon
had risen just beside the sun.

36:39.875 --> 36:41.500
As I lay sleeping,

36:42.375 --> 36:43.833
she came to me.

36:45.958 --> 36:49.291
She witched me and led me to the woods.

36:51.500 --> 36:52.791
She was naked…

36:52.875 --> 36:54.166
[gasping]

36:54.750 --> 36:56.125
…and riding a red mule.

36:56.208 --> 36:57.208
Yes.

36:57.291 --> 36:58.625
[Hannah grunts]

36:58.708 --> 37:01.666
-[Caleb] The red mule became a horned man.
-[laughter]

37:01.750 --> 37:05.250
And she made me watch
as she lay with the Devil.

37:05.333 --> 37:06.250
-Who?
-[man] Who was it?

37:06.333 --> 37:09.833
As both of them lay with the Devil.

37:10.708 --> 37:11.750
Both of them?

37:13.208 --> 37:15.625
[Caleb] Hannah Miller and Sarah Fier!

37:15.708 --> 37:17.541
-No!
-No!

37:17.625 --> 37:19.458
Witches! Witches!

37:19.541 --> 37:20.916
-Witches!
-Witches!

37:21.000 --> 37:22.291
[all shouting] Witches!

37:22.375 --> 37:25.083
Witches! Witches!

37:25.166 --> 37:27.625
I saw Hannah Miller and Sarah Fier.

37:27.708 --> 37:29.333
I saw Hannah Miller.

37:29.416 --> 37:30.625
I saw Hannah Miller.

37:30.708 --> 37:31.791
I saw Hannah Miller.

37:31.875 --> 37:33.208
I saw Sarah Fier.

37:33.291 --> 37:35.666
-I saw Sarah Fier.
-I saw Sarah Fier.

37:36.333 --> 37:38.000
[shouting]

37:38.083 --> 37:39.250
[crowd] Witches!

37:42.958 --> 37:44.916
Witches! The witches!

37:45.000 --> 37:45.958
The witches!

37:53.083 --> 37:55.458
[indistinct shouting]

38:02.166 --> 38:04.458
-We need to get away from here!
-And go where?

38:04.958 --> 38:07.916
[Elijah] Here! They're here!
Witches over here!

38:08.000 --> 38:09.625
Go! Go!

38:11.083 --> 38:12.666
[Caleb] The Devil is in this

38:12.750 --> 38:13.916
disgusting whore!

38:14.000 --> 38:14.916
[Hannah] No!

38:15.000 --> 38:17.750
Silence! Check her for marks!

38:19.958 --> 38:21.708
No! No!

38:21.791 --> 38:23.708
[Hannah grunts]

38:24.750 --> 38:25.666
[Hannah] No!

38:26.208 --> 38:27.666
No! No!

38:27.750 --> 38:29.125
Be still, witch!

38:29.208 --> 38:31.125
[both grunting]

38:32.000 --> 38:33.166
[man 1] Got one!

38:34.000 --> 38:36.916
[Mad Thomas cackles]

38:37.583 --> 38:41.125
[Elijah] As sure as the sun rises,
we will purge Union

38:41.208 --> 38:42.166
of this…

38:42.250 --> 38:43.333
[man 2] Witch!

38:43.416 --> 38:44.708
…wretched pollution!

38:44.791 --> 38:46.708
[shouting, cheering]

38:46.791 --> 38:49.666
[Elijah] We will search every house,

38:49.750 --> 38:51.291
every inch of wood!

38:52.250 --> 38:55.583
We will not rest
and we will not have mercy!

38:55.666 --> 38:57.000
[all shouting] No mercy!

38:57.083 --> 39:01.083
[Elijah] So help me, God,
we will be cleansed of these anathemas!

39:01.583 --> 39:04.250
-[all shouting] Yeah!
-We will have our justice!

39:04.333 --> 39:05.541
Yeah!

39:06.125 --> 39:08.333
We will find Sarah Fier!

39:08.416 --> 39:09.791
[all] Find her!

39:09.875 --> 39:10.875
[man 3] Get up!

39:11.958 --> 39:13.416
[man 4] Find her!

39:14.041 --> 39:16.041
[man 5] Until we find Sarah Fier!

39:18.625 --> 39:20.333
[man 5] Where are you, Sarah Fier?

39:24.041 --> 39:25.541
[crowd shouting] Find the witch!

39:32.916 --> 39:36.250
[panting]

39:37.500 --> 39:40.458
[dogs barking in distance]

39:41.583 --> 39:44.916
-[man 6 in distance] Find her!
-[Sarah gasping]

39:47.333 --> 39:48.791
-Father!
-My fault…

39:49.958 --> 39:51.500
-[George groans]
-Father!

39:52.583 --> 39:53.583
[door opens]

39:57.291 --> 39:59.000
[breathing heavily]

40:02.791 --> 40:04.083
[Elijah] Did you look upstairs?

40:04.833 --> 40:06.541
[Caleb] I did, there's no one there.

40:08.750 --> 40:10.500
[breathing heavily]

40:18.166 --> 40:19.166
[twig snaps]

40:19.250 --> 40:21.958
Did you hear that?
The other side of the house.

40:28.625 --> 40:30.000
[Caleb] We'll find her elsewhere.

40:32.125 --> 40:33.125
[man 7] Open up!

40:33.875 --> 40:35.166
[loud knocking]

40:37.041 --> 40:38.166
[loud knocking]

40:39.208 --> 40:40.375
[door crashes open]

40:41.291 --> 40:43.875
[indistinct shouting]

40:54.625 --> 40:55.625
[Caleb] David!

40:57.250 --> 40:59.791
Take your musket round back
to the Fier house.

40:59.875 --> 41:01.583
Keep an eye on George Fier.

41:02.166 --> 41:04.125
Keep an eye out for that witch.

41:05.208 --> 41:06.250
[indistinct shouting]

41:06.333 --> 41:10.625
[panting]

41:38.416 --> 41:39.583
[stick rattles]

41:57.458 --> 41:58.458
[door closes]

42:00.375 --> 42:01.625
Hannah?

42:02.625 --> 42:04.625
[chains clanging]

42:05.333 --> 42:08.208
[breathing heavily]
What have they done to you?

42:09.750 --> 42:12.500
I am to hang on the morrow.

42:13.875 --> 42:16.458
And if you don't flee, you will too.

42:16.541 --> 42:17.416
[Sarah] No!

42:17.500 --> 42:19.000
[Hannah] Listen to me.

42:19.500 --> 42:21.208
You need to run.

42:22.333 --> 42:24.750
-No, I won't leave you.
-You must!

42:25.750 --> 42:27.458
-[Sarah sighs]
[chains clang]

42:30.583 --> 42:32.500
This is my fault anyway.

42:33.625 --> 42:35.750
-No.
-I led the Devil here.

42:35.833 --> 42:40.208
That is not how it works.
You do not summon the Devil by chance.

42:41.375 --> 42:43.208
You have to make a choice.

42:43.291 --> 42:44.750
Don't you see?

42:45.583 --> 42:48.250
It doesn't matter if we did it or not.

42:48.750 --> 42:51.291
They think we're guilty, so we are.

42:51.375 --> 42:53.833
[dramatic music playing]

42:53.916 --> 42:54.916
You're right.

42:58.833 --> 43:00.750
Everyone believes we've done it.

43:01.791 --> 43:04.000
So what difference does it make
if we do now?

43:05.416 --> 43:08.250
-What are you saying?
-I will go back to the widow.

43:12.625 --> 43:15.625
I will make a deal with the Devil.

43:19.375 --> 43:20.791
Perhaps that can save us.

43:20.875 --> 43:22.375
But the Devil…

43:23.041 --> 43:24.041
Are you mad?

43:24.125 --> 43:25.583
I don't fear the Devil.

43:26.333 --> 43:27.291
Hannah,

43:28.458 --> 43:31.250
I fear the neighbor who would accuse me.

43:32.291 --> 43:36.166
I fear the mother
that would let her daughter hang.

43:37.250 --> 43:38.750
I fear Union.

43:39.708 --> 43:43.791
They lead us like lambs to the slaughter
and expect us to just follow.

43:45.500 --> 43:46.875
Well, they will see…

43:48.833 --> 43:50.500
I am no lamb.

43:50.583 --> 43:53.166
[man 8 shouting] Sarah Fier! Come out!

43:54.833 --> 43:58.916
When this is over,
we will leave this place.

43:59.583 --> 44:01.041
We will go far away

44:01.125 --> 44:03.500
and we'll dance every night,

44:03.583 --> 44:06.208
then kiss in the broad daylight.

44:10.041 --> 44:11.041
[kiss]

44:14.458 --> 44:16.083
I can't lose you.

44:16.166 --> 44:17.750
[Sarah] You won't. [sniffs]

44:20.250 --> 44:21.750
If they want a witch…

44:24.625 --> 44:26.291
I will give them a witch.

44:28.958 --> 44:34.250
-[bird cawing]
-[insects buzzing]

44:38.250 --> 44:40.250
[ominous music playing]

45:02.375 --> 45:03.375
[whispering] Widow!

45:05.125 --> 45:06.125
Mary!

45:31.083 --> 45:32.083
[sighs]

45:33.583 --> 45:36.916

46:06.750 --> 46:08.083
[rapid knocking]

46:08.166 --> 46:09.541
Away, Elijah.

46:09.625 --> 46:14.666
[rapid knocking continues]

46:16.083 --> 46:18.500
-Elijah, I said enough!
-Please, you have to help me!

46:18.583 --> 46:19.666
[Solomon] Sarah?

46:20.541 --> 46:22.833
-We're innocent, Solomon.
-I know…

46:22.916 --> 46:25.208
Hannah and I, we didn't do this!

46:25.291 --> 46:27.833
-You're bleeding.
-It doesn't matter. Listen to me.

46:27.916 --> 46:30.583
I went back to the woods, to the widow.

46:30.666 --> 46:34.083
-Sarah!
-She's dead, Solomon! Someone killed her!

46:34.166 --> 46:35.500
And there was this…

46:36.500 --> 46:37.750
this book…

46:37.833 --> 46:41.250
with a… a kind of instruction,
an incantation.

46:41.750 --> 46:44.458
-An incantation? For what?
-Yeah.

46:44.541 --> 46:45.750
[Sarah] I think…

46:47.083 --> 46:50.125
I think someone struck a deal
with the Devil.

46:51.541 --> 46:52.833
Offering our town.

46:55.000 --> 46:56.041
-Our town?
-[Sarah] Yes.

46:56.125 --> 46:58.791
In exchange, perhaps, for power?

47:00.583 --> 47:02.166
Solomon, I swear it…

47:03.750 --> 47:05.333
it wasn't me!

47:05.416 --> 47:06.958
[gasping]

47:08.041 --> 47:09.041
Sarah…

47:15.625 --> 47:16.625
I believe you.

47:24.250 --> 47:25.583
Who else knows about this?

47:25.666 --> 47:26.833
No one.

47:27.875 --> 47:28.708
[Caleb] Solomon!

47:29.208 --> 47:31.291
[Sarah gasps]

47:32.333 --> 47:34.625
-[Caleb] Solomon!
-Go! Go quickly! Hide!

47:40.666 --> 47:41.666
[Caleb] Solomon!

47:44.041 --> 47:45.041
[Caleb] Solomon!

47:46.916 --> 47:48.208
[loud knocking]

47:49.041 --> 47:50.208
Open up, Solomon!

47:51.750 --> 47:52.750
[bang]

47:55.583 --> 47:57.250
We're looking for Sarah Fier.

47:58.125 --> 47:59.583
There's no one here but me.

47:59.666 --> 48:01.208
Then we're free to search.

48:01.291 --> 48:02.791
[Solomon] Of course you are not.

48:04.250 --> 48:07.166
Do not try to intimidate me, Caleb.
I am not some child!

48:07.250 --> 48:08.833
[man 1] Come out! Sarah!

48:10.500 --> 48:11.708
[gasping]

48:12.833 --> 48:14.625
[Caleb] If only your word was enough,
Solomon.

48:15.833 --> 48:17.583
What's in the back room, Solomon?

48:18.083 --> 48:18.916
[Caleb grunts]

48:20.625 --> 48:22.958
[breathing heavily]

48:27.000 --> 48:28.083
[man 2] Sarah Fier!

48:33.625 --> 48:36.208
[distant shouting] Sarah Fier!
Come out, Sarah Fier!

48:38.875 --> 48:40.333
[Caleb] If there's nothing there,

48:40.416 --> 48:41.541
let me check.

48:42.666 --> 48:44.000
What do you have to hide?

48:44.083 --> 48:45.083
[gasps]

48:46.500 --> 48:50.541
I'll tell you once more.
There's no one here, but me.

48:51.708 --> 48:55.375
[man 3] Sarah Fier! Go around the back!
She's gotta be here somewhere!

49:00.416 --> 49:02.875
[Solomon] Leave immediately,
or I'll make you leave.

49:05.750 --> 49:06.875
Come on!

49:08.875 --> 49:10.666
[Caleb grunts]

49:11.666 --> 49:12.625
[Solomon] Go on…

49:13.708 --> 49:15.000
All of you, go on!

49:15.958 --> 49:16.875
[Caleb shouts]

49:23.291 --> 49:25.875
[ominous music playing]

50:12.875 --> 50:16.708
[ominous music intensifies]

50:26.333 --> 50:27.166
[Solomon] Abbadon…

50:28.416 --> 50:29.416
Ahriman…

50:30.583 --> 50:31.500
Azazel…

50:32.750 --> 50:33.666
Bael…

50:37.250 --> 50:38.250
[choking]

50:45.250 --> 50:46.416
You!

50:47.541 --> 50:48.750
It's you!

50:55.291 --> 50:56.583
[Solomon] Rimmon…

50:58.583 --> 50:59.666
Samael…

51:01.083 --> 51:02.000
Lucifer…

51:03.750 --> 51:04.875
Gorgon…

51:04.958 --> 51:07.791
[demonic chanting]

51:07.875 --> 51:09.083
[Solomon] Beelzebub…

51:12.041 --> 51:13.166
Morning Star…

51:16.833 --> 51:18.625
[ominous music intensifies]

51:18.708 --> 51:20.083
[Solomon] Satan.

51:22.375 --> 51:23.875
It's you.

51:23.958 --> 51:25.375
I'm still me.

51:26.666 --> 51:28.083
I've always been me.

51:28.708 --> 51:33.166
Only I've grown tired of watching fortune
turn a blind eye to me.

51:33.250 --> 51:34.916
How could you?

51:35.000 --> 51:38.166
How could I what? Take what we all want?

51:38.250 --> 51:40.791
What we all came here for?

51:40.875 --> 51:43.791
Power, prosperity, legacy.

51:43.875 --> 51:45.333
Consider, Sarah…

51:46.791 --> 51:47.833
a single soul…

51:47.916 --> 51:50.666
Cyrus Miller.

51:54.916 --> 51:56.083
Just one.

51:56.583 --> 51:57.750
Pastor Miller.

51:57.833 --> 51:59.041
[Solomon] And in return…

52:00.250 --> 52:03.125
what no amount of praying
could ever bring.

52:03.208 --> 52:07.833
One person every few years
seems a small price to pay.

52:08.333 --> 52:10.125
One person?

52:11.416 --> 52:13.666
The pastor slew 12 children!

52:15.041 --> 52:18.083
-My brother! Innocents!
-[Solomon] Innocents.

52:18.583 --> 52:20.000
Who's innocent?

52:22.625 --> 52:25.375
Your neighbors hunt you,

52:26.541 --> 52:28.875
forsake you, curse your name!

52:28.958 --> 52:30.541
Everywhere is ignorance!

52:31.166 --> 52:32.250
Dread!

52:32.333 --> 52:34.958
Yet you resign yourself to it!

52:40.208 --> 52:44.000
They're afraid
because they know you're different.

52:47.125 --> 52:48.375
And you are.

52:51.125 --> 52:55.833
Someone who refuses to settle
for the rules of these dogmatists,

52:55.916 --> 52:58.041
who seeks more from the world.

53:03.333 --> 53:04.541
You're like me.

53:08.750 --> 53:10.625
I am nothing like you!

[Solomon grunts]

Sarah?

Sarah, come back to me!

Please, do not make me hurt you!
I love you, Sarah! I love you!

[Elijah] The penalty
for practicing witchcraft

59:58.916 --> 1:00:00.375
is death by hanging!

1:00:00.458 --> 1:00:02.625

Hang them!

1:00:04.250 --> 1:00:06.333
[commotion]

1:00:06.416 --> 1:00:07.625
Confess!

1:00:09.375 --> 1:00:12.375
Confess your sins or burn in eternal hell.

-No! She's lying!
-I walked with the Devil!

1:00:53.041 --> 1:00:54.500
I lay with him!

1:00:55.541 --> 1:00:57.583
I bewitched the good pastor.

1:00:58.666 --> 1:00:59.958
And I bewitched…

1:01:01.166 --> 1:01:02.458
Hannah Miller.

1:01:55.000 --> 1:01:58.208
The truth will come out.

Maybe not today…

1:02:04.375 --> 1:02:05.791

1:02:06.458 --> 1:02:09.875
The truth shall be your curse.

1:02:11.375 --> 1:02:13.916
It will follow you for eternity.

1:02:14.916 --> 1:02:17.750
I will shadow you forever.

1:02:19.208 --> 1:02:21.208
I will show them what you've done.

1:02:22.000 --> 1:02:23.833
I will never…

1:02:25.375 --> 1:02:26.791
let you go.

Maybe not tomorrow,

1:03:16.208 --> 1:03:18.291
[Lizzie] We can't just leave her here,

1:03:18.791 --> 1:03:21.208
alone underneath this tree.

1:03:22.250 --> 1:03:24.000
[Abigail] She deserves a proper burial.

1:03:24.083 --> 1:03:26.916
[Isaac] Let's move her,
bury her somewhere else.

1:03:30.041 --> 1:03:32.333
So no one else knows where she is.

1:03:33.291 --> 1:03:34.458
[all] Except us.

1:04:20.791 --> 1:04:22.625
and everyone you harm,
