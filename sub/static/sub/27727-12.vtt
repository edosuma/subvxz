Thank you so much, thank you.

And coming up
in this week's show...

01:21.760 --> 01:24.160
JEREMY:
James stands next to a car...

01:25.280 --> 01:28.600
...Richard pulls a face...

01:28.640 --> 01:31.200
...and some Toblerone
falls over.

01:33.640 --> 01:35.600
-(CHEERING)
-Exciting stuff.

01:37.160 --> 01:39.040
Exciting stuff.

01:39.080 --> 01:43.040
It is, um... It is
an action-packed show.

01:43.080 --> 01:45.480
But we start with Lancia.

01:45.520 --> 01:49.240
I've said many times that
over the last hundred years,

01:49.280 --> 01:53.520
no-one has made
more truly exciting cars.

01:53.560 --> 01:56.120
There was the Integrale
and the Stratos,

01:56.160 --> 01:59.880
and the Fulvia, and the 037 -
the list goes on, and on -

01:59.920 --> 02:01.800
and yet all they make today

02:01.840 --> 02:06.720
is a steaming pile of ordure
called the Ypsilon.

02:06.760 --> 02:08.040
Look at it.

02:08.080 --> 02:10.680
I would rather have
a maggot-infested wound

02:10.720 --> 02:12.440
-than drive one of those.
-(LAUGHTER)

02:12.480 --> 02:15.880
Honestly makes me sad
that they've been reduced
to making that,

02:15.880 --> 02:19.120
and it turns out
I'm not the only one.

02:29.600 --> 02:33.360
JEREMY: There's a man in
Italy called Eugenio Amos,

02:33.400 --> 02:37.000
who looked at
the old Delta Integrale

02:37.040 --> 02:38.800
and found himself
wondering...

02:41.600 --> 02:45.360
What would it be like
if Lancia made it today?

02:45.400 --> 02:48.520
How would it feel?
How would it go?

02:48.560 --> 02:52.720
And then he stopped wondering
and decided to find out.

03:03.840 --> 03:06.160
This is what he came up with.

03:14.040 --> 03:15.520
(ENGINE ROARING)

03:17.120 --> 03:21.000
The engine is
a 16-valve 2-litre turbo,

03:21.040 --> 03:22.800
as it was before,

03:22.840 --> 03:25.120
but it has new rods,
new pistons,

03:25.160 --> 03:27.120
a new turbocharger,

03:27.160 --> 03:29.040
and a lot of
electronic tweaking.

03:29.080 --> 03:33.560
So now it develops
330 horsepower!

03:36.800 --> 03:40.320
That's 140 more
than you got in the old car!

03:42.160 --> 03:44.840
And there's more good news.

03:44.880 --> 03:48.560
Most of the body panels
and suspension components

03:48.600 --> 03:53.480
are now made from either
aluminium or carbon fibre.

03:53.520 --> 03:55.880
And there are
two advantages to that.

03:57.040 --> 03:59.480
Number one, they won't rust,

03:59.520 --> 04:02.720
and number two,
they're light.

04:05.200 --> 04:09.600
And because of all this work,
this car is pretty quick.

04:09.640 --> 04:11.160
(ENGINE HUMMING)

04:11.200 --> 04:14.360
There's a fair bit of period
turbo lag, as you can hear.

04:15.440 --> 04:18.000
(CHUCKLES)

04:18.040 --> 04:20.600
But when it gets on song...

04:20.640 --> 04:23.240
(ENGINE PITCH INCREASES)

04:23.240 --> 04:25.600
Bloody hell!

04:27.720 --> 04:32.320
It does 0-60 in four seconds.

04:32.360 --> 04:38.200
And flat-out, it'll be doing
more than 160 miles an hour.

04:38.240 --> 04:42.880
The best thing, though,
is that all the understeer
you got in the original car

04:42.920 --> 04:45.440
has been replaced with...

04:45.480 --> 04:50.480
an extraordinary amount
of grip and neutrality.

04:52.160 --> 04:54.680
It is a bloody brilliant car,
this.

04:54.720 --> 04:56.480
Look at this!

04:57.720 --> 04:59.240
(ENGINE ROARS)

05:01.680 --> 05:04.560
(HE CHUCKLES)

05:04.600 --> 05:06.360
It is properly quick
through there.

05:09.040 --> 05:10.800
Yes, I like this.

05:15.040 --> 05:16.920
Don't go thinking, however,

05:16.920 --> 05:19.120
that all of
the Lancia idiosyncrasies

05:19.160 --> 05:21.040
have been erased.

05:21.080 --> 05:24.720
The steering wheel is mounted
low down between my legs,

05:24.760 --> 05:27.160
so I can't see
any of the dials.

05:27.200 --> 05:29.440
And then here we've got
a lot of buttons and knobs

05:29.480 --> 05:32.360
that don't seem to do
anything at all.

05:32.440 --> 05:35.080
I know this red one
with the rocket ship -

05:35.120 --> 05:38.080
or is it a Philippe Starck
lemon squeezer?

05:38.120 --> 05:40.040
I know that
starts the engine.

05:40.080 --> 05:43.760
But all the rest, no clue
at all, I'm afraid. No clue.

05:43.800 --> 05:45.400
What does "levati" mean?

05:49.360 --> 05:52.120
To find out, I pulled over
to chat with Eugenio,

05:52.160 --> 05:54.560
the man who created this car.

05:54.600 --> 06:00.080
A man who turned out to be,
let's say, fully Italian.

06:00.120 --> 06:02.280
-On the steering wheel--
-Mm-hm?

06:02.320 --> 06:06.800
...I've been a bit confused
by this button.

06:06.840 --> 06:10.920
EUGENIO: Levati? Well,
"levati" in Italian means,

06:10.960 --> 06:14.920
it's the translation of
the word, like, "move".

06:14.960 --> 06:17.720
You press that button
and you flash the lights,

06:17.760 --> 06:19.720
and hopefully people
will move from your way.

06:19.760 --> 06:22.160
So it just means...
That's Italian
for "get out of my way"?

06:22.200 --> 06:23.800
Yes, exactly.

06:23.840 --> 06:28.040
After clearing that up, he
really got into his stride.

06:28.080 --> 06:30.160
-Did you weld that?
-Personally?

06:30.200 --> 06:33.120
-Mm.
-No. It's like porn.

06:33.160 --> 06:36.040
-Porn?
-It's welding porn.

06:36.080 --> 06:39.720
-What's the gold?
-Um, it's to...

06:39.760 --> 06:42.440
Basically,
it would have a function.

06:42.480 --> 06:44.680
Not in this case.
We just like it.

06:44.720 --> 06:46.920
OK. It's pretty.

06:46.960 --> 06:48.960
-So it's just
a pretty gold bar?
-Yes.

06:49.000 --> 06:50.960
Why did you do two doors?

06:51.000 --> 06:53.400
Two doors?
Because... Why not?

06:53.440 --> 06:56.720
-I think it looks cool.
-It looks very snazzy.

06:56.760 --> 06:59.000
And then how would you
describe that bottom now?

06:59.040 --> 07:03.680
Well, it's... I would say
it's a very nice ass.

07:03.720 --> 07:07.080
-Mm-hm.
-And this is the more...
small detail.

07:07.120 --> 07:10.600
I would say it's like
the thong that comes out
from the jeans.

07:12.480 --> 07:14.640
That's... OK.

07:14.680 --> 07:19.280
With everything
fully explained,
I got back on the move.

07:19.320 --> 07:22.280
You have got to love
the Italians, haven't you?

07:22.320 --> 07:25.280
I mean, Eugenio said
a lot of the stuff in here

07:25.320 --> 07:28.640
wasn't working because,
"If it was working,
then it would be an Audi."

07:28.680 --> 07:30.200
(CHUCKLES)

07:33.440 --> 07:37.360
I love this car precisely
because it isn't an Audi.

07:37.400 --> 07:42.320
And I love it because someone
cared enough to make it.

07:42.360 --> 07:44.960
And I love it most of all

07:45.000 --> 07:47.800
because it's giving me
my youth back.

07:56.760 --> 07:58.880
There is, however,
one problem.

07:58.920 --> 08:02.520
It costs a quarter
of a million pounds.

08:05.600 --> 08:08.120
And I'm sorry,
but if I was going to spurt

08:08.160 --> 08:12.360
big lumps of money on
an updated classic Lancia,

08:12.400 --> 08:16.680
I'd spurt them on the most
classic Lancia of them all...

08:19.200 --> 08:21.240
the Stratos.

08:29.240 --> 08:32.520
Yes, you couldn't fit in it
if you were shaped
like a human,

08:32.560 --> 08:35.400
and thanks to its
signature short wheelbase,

08:35.440 --> 08:37.760
it handled like a psychopath.

08:37.840 --> 08:39.960
But, a few years back,

08:40.000 --> 08:42.040
a team of people
from all across Europe,

08:42.080 --> 08:45.440
including Germany's
13th best horse rider,

08:45.480 --> 08:47.880
got together and wondered

08:47.880 --> 08:51.880
what a modern Stratos
would be like.

08:51.960 --> 08:55.760
And then they stopped
wondering and got to work.

08:55.760 --> 08:58.280
They bought a Ferrari 430,

08:58.320 --> 09:02.200
removed the entire body
and threw it away.

09:02.240 --> 09:08.080
And then 20 centimetres
was cut from the wheelbase
of what remained.

09:08.120 --> 09:11.320
After this,
the V8 was uprated

09:11.360 --> 09:13.880
and so was the cockpit frame.

09:13.960 --> 09:17.040
A new exhaust system
was fitted

09:17.080 --> 09:21.120
and then a new
carbon fibre body was made

09:21.160 --> 09:22.760
to create this...

09:27.520 --> 09:29.480
The new Stratos.

09:32.160 --> 09:34.120
Pretty, isn't it?

09:42.200 --> 09:45.240
And it's even better
when you get inside.

09:47.200 --> 09:50.320
Look at this. I fit.
And there's air-conditioning,

09:50.360 --> 09:53.400
and a button
that changes the setting
of the traction control.

09:53.440 --> 09:56.280
And it's got door pockets

09:56.320 --> 09:57.840
big enough
for a crash helmet,

09:57.880 --> 10:00.160
just like in the original.

10:00.200 --> 10:02.880
(ENGINE STARTS AND REVS)

10:02.960 --> 10:08.040
Right, let's see if this is
just misty-eyed nostalgia,

10:08.080 --> 10:11.960
or whether it actually works.

10:14.200 --> 10:16.440
(ENGINE REVVING)

10:20.880 --> 10:23.480
It is not
misty-eyed nostalgia.

10:25.240 --> 10:28.880
The first thing you notice
is the stiffness.

10:30.640 --> 10:33.080
And then there's
the lightness.

10:33.120 --> 10:38.160
It's actually 100 kilograms
lighter than the Ferrari
on which it's based.

10:40.080 --> 10:43.640
You can certainly feel that
when you accelerate.

10:45.160 --> 10:46.840
Nought to 60...

10:49.240 --> 10:52.240
Three point three seconds.

10:52.280 --> 10:56.160
And it'll keep on going
all the way past 200!

10:58.520 --> 11:00.720
This is alarmingly fast!

11:04.560 --> 11:05.840
Jesus H Christ!

11:07.440 --> 11:10.120
You sense it too
in the corners.

11:10.160 --> 11:13.240
-(TYRES SQUEALING)
-It's just so darty.

11:13.280 --> 11:17.680
It's like driving a...
a dragonfly.

11:17.720 --> 11:20.880
I thought the McLaren Senna
felt light, but this...

11:32.160 --> 11:34.640
And because of
the short wheelbase,

11:34.680 --> 11:36.880
it's incredibly playful.

11:36.920 --> 11:41.280
Never does
the same thing twice.

interactive computer books

12:22.600 --> 12:25.440
where you choose the ending.

12:25.480 --> 12:27.880
Except you don't choose
the ending.

12:29.720 --> 12:31.800
It does.

12:34.400 --> 12:38.120
This, then, is very like
the original Stratos.

an utterly, utterly

I don't care, though,
because spinning
and having accidents,

13:05.280 --> 13:09.040
it's like falling off your
Raleigh Burner BMX,

13:17.920 --> 13:22.520

a really big house.

-£650,000?
-Yes.

a bit sawn out of the middle?

Well, it's a bit more
than that.

why don't you just buy
a Stratos?

a little there for
one of the right-handers,

14:38.520 --> 14:42.240
but very, very tidy
through there.

14:42.280 --> 14:45.960
Now, Abbie dropping into
Your Name Here,

14:46.000 --> 14:48.400
and even tidier
through there.

14:48.440 --> 14:51.680
But, how many random
handling tricks

14:51.720 --> 14:53.320
will we get round there?

14:53.360 --> 14:56.040
Absolutely none at all.
It's nailed there!

14:57.760 --> 15:00.840
Flicking out
the other side like a flea,

15:00.880 --> 15:03.840
and already on the run
back to Old Lady's House.

15:03.880 --> 15:06.600
It's faster and sharper,
a Ferrari improved

15:06.640 --> 15:10.040
by the removal of
needless weight and length.

15:10.080 --> 15:12.480
Now, Old Lady's House,
here we go.

15:12.520 --> 15:14.720
Danced through there
brilliantly.

15:14.760 --> 15:17.600
And absolutely brilliant
through the second bit
as well.

15:17.640 --> 15:21.320
And now the full-bore run
to Substation.

15:21.360 --> 15:23.800
-That thing looks epic.
-(TYRES SQUEALING)

15:23.840 --> 15:25.920
Stable under braking,
tidy through the corner.

15:25.960 --> 15:28.880
Bit of a squiggle
on the way out. Anything
through Field of Sheep?

15:28.920 --> 15:30.920
No, tidy as anything
and across the line!

15:32.720 --> 15:34.200
You've got to admit,
that did look--

15:34.240 --> 15:36.360
-It looks very exciting.
-That does look quick.

15:36.400 --> 15:38.920
-It does. Yeah.
-It does.

15:38.960 --> 15:40.440
It looks very exciting.

15:40.480 --> 15:42.400
I particularly enjoyed
the bit where you said,

15:42.440 --> 15:45.000
"improved by the removal of
needless length and weight."

15:45.040 --> 15:47.200
Well, that's me, isn't it?
I mean, that is clearly--

15:47.240 --> 15:49.520
Just... Just... No, I still
don't want to talk to you.

15:49.560 --> 15:51.720
-Do you not?
How fast did it go?
-No. Yes, exactly.

15:51.760 --> 15:53.440
Let's find out. There.
Look, there's the board.

15:53.480 --> 15:56.480
Let's see
where the Stratos goes on it.

15:57.640 --> 15:59.200
-(BELL PINGS)
-Yeah. Oh.

15:59.240 --> 16:01.960
JEREMY: 17th. That's not bad.
JAMES: No, hang on a minute.

16:02.000 --> 16:05.080
-What do you mean,
"Hang on a minute"?
-That's over a second slower

16:05.120 --> 16:08.000
than a four-door BMW saloon.

16:08.040 --> 16:09.880
Yeah. Yeah, no, it is slower,

16:09.920 --> 16:12.480
but it's a lot more
expensive, so...

16:12.520 --> 16:14.200
-Good point.
-Tell you what.

16:14.240 --> 16:15.960
Let's find out how fast
the Delta went, OK?

16:16.000 --> 16:17.600
Integrale. Here we go.

16:17.640 --> 16:19.680
Didn't bother filming it,
but we have got the time.

16:19.720 --> 16:21.080
-(BELL PINGS)
-Ah... Oh.

16:21.120 --> 16:23.000
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHS)
JAMES: Yeah. Now, an old--

16:23.040 --> 16:27.400
No, look at it this way.
It's actually the same speed
as a BMW M2.

16:27.440 --> 16:29.160
I think I can also claim
quite reasonably

16:29.200 --> 16:32.400
that the old Mercedes A45

16:32.440 --> 16:34.320
would go round the track
faster than that.

16:34.360 --> 16:36.640
Yeah, and be a hell of
a lot cheaper, just a fact.

16:36.680 --> 16:39.600
Yes, but, but, everything
on a Mercedes would work,

16:39.640 --> 16:42.160
-and who wants that? Be dull.
-(LAUGHTER)

16:42.200 --> 16:44.360
It's what Eu...
It's what Eugenio was saying.

16:44.400 --> 16:47.680
You don't want German.
You aren't in the Italian
frame of mind, you two.

16:47.720 --> 16:49.520
-Are we not?
-No, you're not.
That's the trouble.

16:49.560 --> 16:52.200
-Has anyone here
got an Italian car?
-(NO REPLY FROM AUDIENCE)

16:52.240 --> 16:54.360
No, they're not here,
are they?
They didn't make it.

16:54.400 --> 16:56.280
-(LAUGHTER)
-It's raining.

16:56.320 --> 16:58.200
Did you... Yes, that is
a good point, actually.

16:58.240 --> 17:01.000
It's also very windy,
and before the tent blows
away, we should get on.

17:01.040 --> 17:04.080
We should. We must move on,
because now it is time for us

17:04.120 --> 17:08.240
to score a bag of chat
from the dealer of debate...

17:08.280 --> 17:12.080
-God.
-...on Conversation Street.

17:12.080 --> 17:14.080
(LIVELY JAZZ MUSIC)

17:14.160 --> 17:15.880
(THUD)

17:18.040 --> 17:20.320
I like that one.
I really like that one.

17:20.320 --> 17:21.880
It's my favourite.

17:24.080 --> 17:27.280
-I don't even remember
my head coming off.
-I do.

17:27.320 --> 17:28.880
Anyway,
look, let's get on with it.

17:28.920 --> 17:30.680
I've got some
very interesting news
for you, James.

17:30.720 --> 17:33.720
Oh, God! Not more speed
of bloody birds, please.

17:33.760 --> 17:36.040
-Oh, is it?
-No.

17:36.080 --> 17:39.040
-Speed of fish.
-Oh, for God's sake, no.

17:39.080 --> 17:40.480
-Go on, go on.
-OK.

17:40.520 --> 17:44.160
How fast do you think
a salmon can cross a road?

17:44.200 --> 17:48.080
Salmon don't cross roads.
You're thinking of a chicken.

17:48.160 --> 17:52.280
You say that.
Watch this piece of footage
I found on the internet.

17:52.320 --> 17:54.320
JEREMY: Look at that!
RICHARD:
What, are they salmon?

17:54.400 --> 17:56.720
-They're fish?
-It's actually salmons.

17:56.760 --> 17:58.680
RICHARD:
Oh, no, that is actually
quite interesting.

17:58.720 --> 18:01.320
It is. Look at them!
There's hundreds of them
going across a road.

18:01.320 --> 18:03.760
-What are they doing?
-This is the interesting
thing.

18:03.800 --> 18:06.560
If I were a salmon...
And they have to go back
to their breeding ground,

18:06.560 --> 18:08.200
or spawning ground,
don't they?

18:08.240 --> 18:10.320
I wouldn't be bothered. I'd
just stay on the other side.

18:10.320 --> 18:11.640
"Oh, I'll have
the baby here."

18:11.680 --> 18:13.400
When my children were born,
I didn't think,

18:13.440 --> 18:14.760
"I've got to get back
to Doncaster!"

18:14.800 --> 18:16.400
I just went to
the nearest hospital.

18:16.440 --> 18:19.520
No, salmon are very
determined. You have to
respect them for that.

18:19.560 --> 18:22.760
Actually, fish, I think,
are pretty cool.

18:22.800 --> 18:24.800
Actually, is it not
remarkable that car-makers

18:24.880 --> 18:27.080
have never named cars
after fish?

18:27.160 --> 18:28.400
Good conversation.

18:28.440 --> 18:30.080
They've named them after,
you know--

18:30.080 --> 18:31.800
Big cats, they've done.

18:31.880 --> 18:33.320
-Birds. Lots of birds.
-Birds they've done.

18:33.400 --> 18:35.400
-The weather.
-Greek gods.

18:35.440 --> 18:37.920
Why has there never been
a Ferrari Salmon?

18:37.960 --> 18:40.920
Determined, agile,
good at cornering.

18:40.960 --> 18:42.520
Lamborghini Tuna.

18:42.560 --> 18:45.320
Yeah, I was gonna...
The tuna is a very fast fish.

18:45.320 --> 18:48.080
-40 miles an hour,
a tuna will go.
-Faster than a speedboat.

18:48.080 --> 18:49.920
Faster than a jet-ski
you rent on holiday.

18:49.960 --> 18:52.720
It's a brilliant idea.
I can't wait for
the Ford Haddock.

18:52.760 --> 18:54.680
-Mm.
-(LAUGHTER)

18:54.720 --> 18:57.520
Can anyone think of a car
that's been named
after a fish?

18:57.560 --> 18:59.200
-Stingray.
-Barracuda.

18:59.240 --> 19:01.720
-Oh, now--
-There's the Stingray--

19:01.760 --> 19:03.680
Stingray, yes.
Barracuda. Manta.

19:03.720 --> 19:05.280
Manta.

19:05.320 --> 19:08.040
Isn't it amazing how all cars
are named after fish?

19:08.080 --> 19:12.280
-It's an astonishing thing.
-We can edit all that
other stuff out.

19:12.320 --> 19:14.440
Yeah, the audience knows
a lot more than we do.

19:14.480 --> 19:16.080
That's basically
what we're talking about.

19:16.160 --> 19:18.200
I'd completely forgotten
about the Barracuda.

19:18.240 --> 19:20.800
Plymouth Barracuda,
yeah, and the Opel.
Yes, absolutely.

19:20.880 --> 19:23.080
Now, you know
we've always said

19:23.080 --> 19:26.160
that Canada
is God's pantry, yeah?

19:26.200 --> 19:29.320
-Yes.
-And that Saudi Arabia
is his petrol station.

19:29.320 --> 19:31.400
Yeah, and Lancashire is his
cupboard under the stairs.

19:31.440 --> 19:33.440
Our tent's
about to blow down.

19:33.480 --> 19:34.800
Exactly. This is
the wind tunnel.

19:34.880 --> 19:36.440
France is
his drinks globe.

19:36.480 --> 19:37.880
France is the drinks globe.

19:37.920 --> 19:41.480
Argentina is his cesspit,
Bol... Bolivia is his--

19:41.520 --> 19:43.280
Yeah.

19:43.320 --> 19:45.440
Yeah. It is.

19:46.880 --> 19:49.520
You really got that one,
yeah.

19:49.560 --> 19:51.080
Point I'm trying to make,
though, is,

19:51.160 --> 19:54.200
as we've always agreed,
Italy is his race track, yes?

19:54.240 --> 19:55.720
-Yeah.
-This is a known fact.

19:55.760 --> 19:58.560
We saw it earlier with the
Integrale and the Stratos.

19:58.560 --> 20:00.160
Now, this is a point
that's been proved,

20:00.200 --> 20:02.560
because the mayor of
a small hamlet,

20:02.640 --> 20:06.800
um, called Acquetico in...
near the French border,

20:06.880 --> 20:08.920
he installed a speed camera

20:08.960 --> 20:10.880
on a two-week trial period,
OK?

20:10.920 --> 20:13.680
Now, we've got a picture of
the village in question here.

20:13.720 --> 20:17.000
RICHARD: Oh, that's lovely.
-Yeah, we're not talking
about a vast metropolis here.

20:17.040 --> 20:20.080
Now, in the two-week trial
period of the speed camera,

20:20.160 --> 20:22.640
the number of people
it caught breaking
the speed limit was...

20:23.760 --> 20:25.760
-...58,560.
-What?

20:25.800 --> 20:28.480
-(LAUGHTER)
-There, in that village?

20:28.520 --> 20:31.960
JEREMY: 58,500, in two weeks!
-What?

20:32.000 --> 20:34.240
They can't help themselves,
the Italians, can they?

20:34.280 --> 20:36.480
Well, wait a minute. That
many in two weeks, during...

20:36.520 --> 20:39.080
-Let's assume it was quieter
at night. It looks it.
-Yeah.

20:39.160 --> 20:41.680
So during the day there must
have been at least one car

20:41.720 --> 20:43.880
every ten seconds
setting the camera off.

20:43.920 --> 20:45.960
People would have been
done twice a day. No, wait.

20:46.000 --> 20:47.800
On the way to work,
then back for lunch,

20:47.880 --> 20:50.240
-then back to work,
then back home at night.
-"It's happened again."

20:50.280 --> 20:52.440
"This flashing is annoying."

20:52.480 --> 20:56.240
What I, what I love,
though, is the mayor
is still deciding

20:56.280 --> 20:59.080
whether a speed camera
is necessary.

20:59.080 --> 21:01.160
-(LAUGHTER)
-What does he want?

21:01.200 --> 21:03.800
He's quoted in one of the
papers I read the other day

21:03.800 --> 21:06.640
as saying, "Well, the problem
is we have good asphalt

21:06.680 --> 21:08.400
and long continuous bends."

21:08.440 --> 21:10.760
So, he's basically said,
"It's a really nice road,

21:10.800 --> 21:12.800
so of course people
are going to speed."

21:12.880 --> 21:15.760
"Plus, we're Italian,
so what do you expect?"
No, good effort.

21:15.800 --> 21:18.640
Meanwhile, in the UK,
things are rather different.

21:18.680 --> 21:21.560
Um, there's a man in
Bedfordshire, right, he's...

21:21.560 --> 21:24.440
Which is a county in
England-land if you're
watching elsewhere.

21:24.480 --> 21:27.040
Er, and he's put
a fake speed camera

21:27.080 --> 21:29.240
on the side of his house,
which is by the A1.

21:29.280 --> 21:30.800
We're got a picture
of it here.

21:30.800 --> 21:33.520
As you can see,
it is very realistic.

21:33.560 --> 21:35.000
-Would you agree, yeah?
-Completely.

21:35.040 --> 21:36.800
And he's been told
to take it down

21:36.800 --> 21:42.000
because the highways agency
say it's distracting drivers.

21:42.040 --> 21:44.200
-(LAUGHTER)
-Oh, wait. Wait a minute.

21:44.240 --> 21:46.200
-Yeah.
-The highways agency
have said

21:46.240 --> 21:48.960
something that looks exactly
like a speed camera

21:49.000 --> 21:50.720
-is distracting drivers?
-Yeah.

21:50.760 --> 21:52.680
They've rather shot
themselves in the foot
with that one.

21:52.720 --> 21:54.560
Yeah, because
what they're saying is

21:54.640 --> 21:57.280
speed cameras are distracting
drivers and they're therefore
dangerous.

21:57.320 --> 22:00.360
Speed cameras,
according to the government,

22:00.400 --> 22:02.720
are killing baby children
and small puppy dogs.

22:02.760 --> 22:04.640
-(LAUGHTER)
-So, shall we have a vote?

22:04.680 --> 22:06.160
Yeah, let's have...
Do we all agree?

22:06.200 --> 22:08.520
Who thinks all speed cameras
should be removed?

22:08.560 --> 22:12.120
AUDIENCE: Yes!
-Highways agency,
we agree with you.

22:12.160 --> 22:14.440
-We support you
in your campaign.
-100%...

22:14.480 --> 22:16.760
-100% of us.
-...of the British population

22:16.800 --> 22:19.120
agree that they should all
be taken down now.

22:19.160 --> 22:21.200
-Good, that's that sorted.
-Cleared that up. Good.

22:21.240 --> 22:22.760
-(LAUGHTER)
-Er, I'd like to move...

22:22.800 --> 22:25.080
I've got some
very big and interesting
conversation, actually.

22:25.120 --> 22:28.800
-Peugeot have made...
-Mmm.
-...an interesting car.

22:28.840 --> 22:30.440
-Bet they haven't.
-Er, no chance.

22:30.480 --> 22:32.160
No, they have. I've got
a picture of it here, look.

22:32.200 --> 22:34.240
It is called the e-Legend.

22:34.280 --> 22:36.200
RICHARD: Ooh, hang on.
-It has two electric motors.

22:36.240 --> 22:39.880
It has 456 horsepower
and it is designed

22:39.920 --> 22:42.520
to look like the old
Peugeot 504 Coupe.

22:42.560 --> 22:44.440
JEREMY: Well, it doesn't.
-No, they say it does.

22:44.480 --> 22:46.920
-It does a bit.
-It doesn't.
Looks more like the 505 GTi,

22:46.960 --> 22:48.520
he said
in a rather boring way.

22:48.560 --> 22:51.080
I don't care what old car
it looks a bit like.

22:51.120 --> 22:53.560
-Look. It looks fantastic.
-It does. When can we buy it?

22:53.600 --> 22:55.000
-Er, you can't.
-Oh.

22:55.040 --> 22:57.480
No, it's just a sort of
concept car design study.

22:57.520 --> 23:00.120
What you can buy, though,
right now, is, er, this.

23:00.160 --> 23:02.800
RICHARD: Oh, God, really?
-Yeah.

23:02.840 --> 23:05.680
That's called the, er...
That's called the Rifter.

23:05.720 --> 23:07.880
It's a sort of diesel van.

23:07.920 --> 23:09.800
Oh, what is wrong
with Peugeot?

23:09.840 --> 23:11.880
-It's a good question.
-Why are they reminding us

23:11.920 --> 23:14.360
that they used to build
some really very
good-looking cars,

23:14.400 --> 23:17.000
and then we can only buy
dreary crap like that?

23:17.040 --> 23:19.120
-(LAUGHTER)
-No, it baffles me,

23:19.160 --> 23:21.440
because why would you make
a concept car you can't buy?

23:21.480 --> 23:25.040
When you go to a greengrocer,
"This succulent, juicy apple,
you can't have that one.

23:25.080 --> 23:27.320
We've got some
mouldy ones in the back."

23:27.360 --> 23:31.200
Peugeot, go to a greengrocer
and see how they do business,
and then learn from them.

23:31.240 --> 23:33.680
-(LAUGHTER)
-Now, a few months ago,

23:33.720 --> 23:35.000
there was a bit of
a problem in Britain.

23:35.040 --> 23:36.800
It's been going on
for a year or more,

23:36.840 --> 23:39.080
where kids
are getting on mopeds,
riding down the pavement,

23:39.120 --> 23:40.920
another kid on the back,
helping themselves

23:40.960 --> 23:43.480
to people's phones
and old ladies' handbags
and what have you,

23:43.520 --> 23:44.960
as they're going along, yeah?

23:45.000 --> 23:46.560
It's a big problem
for the police

23:46.600 --> 23:49.080
because in busy city streets,
how do you chase a moped?

23:49.120 --> 23:50.480
-You can't.
-Well, exactly, no.

23:50.520 --> 23:52.280
However, the police
came up with an idea

23:52.320 --> 23:53.720
that they thought
would solve it,

23:53.760 --> 23:57.840
which was to basically
ram the moped thieves, OK?

23:57.880 --> 23:59.800
(CHEERING)

23:59.840 --> 24:02.240
You're applauding?

24:02.280 --> 24:05.480
We've actually got footage
of them doing just that here.

24:05.520 --> 24:08.080
Ready. There he is, and bam!

24:08.120 --> 24:10.200
-(LAUGHTER AND CHEERING)
-Yeah! Down you go.

24:10.240 --> 24:12.400
And...

24:12.440 --> 24:14.440
booyah!

24:14.480 --> 24:15.960
That's what you need.

24:16.000 --> 24:18.120
You see, we're all in favour
of that, are we not?

24:18.160 --> 24:20.240
-Yeah, yeah.
-It's the only time
in my life

24:20.280 --> 24:22.320
I've ever wanted
to be a policeman.

24:22.360 --> 24:23.720
-(LAUGHTER)
-No, you can't.

24:23.760 --> 24:25.040
-Why?
-You haven't got a moustache.

24:25.080 --> 24:26.440
-That's true.
-No, but that...

24:26.480 --> 24:30.480
-OK, I have had an idea.
-Oh, God. Is it ridiculous?

24:30.520 --> 24:32.640
-Let me explain.
-That's a yes, then, it is.

24:32.680 --> 24:35.080
Just let's see
what everybody thinks.

24:35.120 --> 24:37.840
OK, so best will
in the world, the police
are out patrolling,

24:37.880 --> 24:40.840
and they don't do much
of that these days,
as I'm sure we all know.

24:40.880 --> 24:42.240
-Yeah.
-But even if they were,

24:42.280 --> 24:44.440
the chances of them
encountering somebody

24:44.480 --> 24:47.120
who really was a moped thief

24:47.160 --> 24:50.280
in a place where
they could realistically
knock them off

24:50.320 --> 24:52.520
-is quite remote, yes?
-Yes.

24:52.560 --> 24:54.040
So how's this for an idea?

24:54.080 --> 24:56.160
All of us, as we're
driving along in our cars,

24:56.200 --> 24:59.320
if you see a motorcycle,
knock them off.

24:59.360 --> 25:00.760
(LAUGHTER)

25:00.800 --> 25:02.520
Wait. What,
just any motorcyclist?

25:02.560 --> 25:06.160
Yes, because eventually
somebody's bound to hit
the right one

25:06.200 --> 25:08.640
and knock over,
er, a moped thief.

25:08.680 --> 25:10.600
Hang on, isn't that
a bit like Pol Pot

25:10.640 --> 25:13.800
executing anybody
who wore glasses
in case they'd read a book?

25:13.840 --> 25:15.320
-(LAUGHTER)
-Yes, it is.

25:15.360 --> 25:18.040
Look, I admit, you two,
I know you're not
moped thieves,

25:18.080 --> 25:21.000
I know you're not,
but you do ride motorcycles
and that's fine.

25:21.040 --> 25:23.200
And you are going to get,
I have to admit,

25:23.240 --> 25:24.920
some hurty knees
and a bit of grazing.

25:24.960 --> 25:27.400
Well, yes, and quite a lot
of other people,

25:27.440 --> 25:30.800
including Ewan McGregor,
Jamie Oliver, Ross Noble.

25:30.840 --> 25:33.120
The Hairy Bikers,
for God's sake!

25:33.160 --> 25:35.760
-You can't knock them over.
-Yes, I know, you say that,

25:35.800 --> 25:38.320
but they're just casualties
of war if you think about it.

25:38.360 --> 25:40.640
-(LAUGHTER)
-The main thing is

25:40.680 --> 25:44.240
that we are bound to
totally end moped thievery,

25:44.280 --> 25:46.920
-and we'd all have a good
laugh at the same time.
-No.

25:46.960 --> 25:48.480
Come on, you would.

25:48.520 --> 25:50.520
You can't ram bikers.

25:50.560 --> 25:53.120
I'm not saying we ram them.
A gentle nudge.

25:53.160 --> 25:55.080
Anybody here ride motorcycle?

25:55.120 --> 25:57.120
-Yes. Well done.
-(SEVERAL PEOPLE CALL OUT)

25:57.160 --> 25:58.560
-Sorry.
-(LAUGHTER)

26:01.360 --> 26:03.120
Anyway,
I think that's the end
of Conversation Street.

26:03.160 --> 26:04.800
-Yes, it is.
-Let's move it on.

26:04.840 --> 26:07.560
Yeah, let's move it on.
Earlier on,
Jeremy was listing

26:07.600 --> 26:11.480
all the wonderful and
remarkable cars that Lancia
have made over the years,

26:11.520 --> 26:14.880
but let's not forget
Porsche has also made

26:14.920 --> 26:16.720
some rather remarkable cars.

26:16.760 --> 26:18.720
Absolutely.
There was the 911.

26:18.760 --> 26:21.600
There was another
sort of 911.

26:21.640 --> 26:24.040
There was
a slightly different 911
that was green.

26:24.080 --> 26:27.720
Yes, yes, yes, I know,
but this year marks
the 50th anniversary

26:27.760 --> 26:31.600
of what I think must be the
greatest Porsche of them all.

26:31.640 --> 26:33.720
-Is it a 911?
-No.

26:36.360 --> 26:40.440
JAMES:
It's called the Porsche 917.

26:40.480 --> 26:44.480
And even if you have
no interest in motorsport,

26:44.520 --> 26:47.120
you'll most likely
recognise this machine...

26:48.440 --> 26:50.000
because it's
quite possibly

26:50.040 --> 26:53.040
the most iconic racing car
ever created.

26:56.440 --> 26:59.520
Now, today Porsche is
the most successful car maker

26:59.560 --> 27:01.200
ever to race at Le Mans.

27:01.240 --> 27:03.640
They have 19 victories
to their name.

27:03.680 --> 27:05.640
But this is the car
that started it all.

27:05.680 --> 27:09.560
This is the car
that gave them that
all-important first win.

27:09.600 --> 27:11.560
Now, obviously,
with a pedigree like that,

27:11.600 --> 27:15.200
it's quite valuable,
around £14 million.

27:15.240 --> 27:17.800
So when we asked
the insurance
if this would be OK,

27:17.840 --> 27:20.680
they said yes, but not the
accident-prone little midget.

27:20.720 --> 27:23.640
"It must be Captain Slowly."

27:23.680 --> 27:26.720
So let's see if I can make
this thing live for you.

27:26.760 --> 27:28.640
The first thing
you need to know is that,

27:28.680 --> 27:32.520
although the 917
looks like a big, wide car,

27:32.560 --> 27:34.880
actually, it isn't.

27:36.000 --> 27:37.720
Ow.

27:37.760 --> 27:39.280
(STRAINING)

27:43.800 --> 27:45.440
-I'm in.
-(HEAD THUMPS)

27:45.480 --> 27:47.560
God, it's tiny!

27:51.720 --> 27:54.120
(ENGINE GROWLING)

27:58.680 --> 28:00.480
(ENGINE ROARING)

28:00.520 --> 28:01.840
Holy mother!

28:03.520 --> 28:05.120
Ahh!

28:06.720 --> 28:07.840
(CHUCKLING)

28:09.760 --> 28:12.400
(ENGINE ROARING)

28:12.440 --> 28:15.160
The racket
is just astonishing.

28:15.200 --> 28:18.280
Imagine this
for a 24-hour race.

28:22.480 --> 28:25.280
Even though
it's a 50-year-old car,

28:25.320 --> 28:29.440
the 917 is fast by the
standards of any decade.

28:29.480 --> 28:32.720
Nought to 60, 2.7 seconds.

28:32.760 --> 28:36.800
Top speed, 224 miles an hour.

28:38.840 --> 28:41.280
And it was built
without compromise,

28:41.320 --> 28:44.760
using the absolute
bare minimum of materials.

28:46.400 --> 28:49.200
So, for example,
this bodywork,

28:49.240 --> 28:51.000
which is very close
to my head,

28:51.040 --> 28:52.760
it's fibreglass,

28:52.800 --> 28:55.440
1.2 millimetres thick,
that's it.

28:55.480 --> 28:58.480
Now, in front of me
I have a big rev counter,

28:58.520 --> 29:00.920
an oil temperature gauge,
and an oil pressure gauge.

29:00.960 --> 29:03.000
That's all the information
you get.

29:03.040 --> 29:04.920
If those
are reading correctly,

29:04.960 --> 29:07.720
that means the engine
isn't going to blow up,

29:07.760 --> 29:10.560
and that means
you can pin it!

29:13.400 --> 29:19.160
Jeez! It's the world's
fastest canoe!

29:19.200 --> 29:21.400
The five-litre
12-cylinder engine

29:21.440 --> 29:25.080
produces 621 horsepower,

29:25.120 --> 29:29.040
which is modest
by the standards of today's
road-going hypercars.

29:29.080 --> 29:33.440
But this thing weighs
just 800 kilograms.

29:33.480 --> 29:35.640
As a result,
the power-to-weight...

29:36.840 --> 29:38.200
is off the scale!

29:40.800 --> 29:42.280
Bloody hell, this is special.

29:46.000 --> 29:48.120
I'm amazed Porsche
let me drive it at all.

29:48.160 --> 29:50.640
I mean, they didn't
give me any training.

29:50.680 --> 29:52.160
They just put me in and said,

29:52.200 --> 29:55.760
"Pull zis und turn zat and,
oh, you'll be fine, mm."

29:57.680 --> 29:59.280
What's more amazing
than that, actually,

29:59.320 --> 30:00.880
is that this car
exists at all,

30:00.920 --> 30:04.200
because its gestation was...

30:04.240 --> 30:07.560
let's say...
it was quite difficult.

30:11.680 --> 30:16.560
JAMES: The story of its birth
starts in 1968,

30:16.600 --> 30:18.640
when the governing body
for sports car racing,

30:18.680 --> 30:22.280
alarmed that the top-end,
unregulated prototype cars

30:22.320 --> 30:27.000
were becoming too fast, too
expensive, and too dangerous,

30:27.040 --> 30:33.040
decreed that such machines
should have engines
no larger than three litres.

30:33.080 --> 30:35.800
However,
the governing body also said
that if you could build

30:35.840 --> 30:38.360
25 road-going versions
of your racing car,

30:38.400 --> 30:41.360
that engine limit would be
raised to five litres.

30:41.400 --> 30:44.840
Although,
secretly they knew that no
small sports car manufacturer

30:44.880 --> 30:47.760
could actually afford
to do that.

30:47.800 --> 30:51.240
They didn't think
there'd be any takers.

30:51.280 --> 30:56.320
What they hadn't reckoned on
was Porsche's head of
motorsport Ferdinand Piech.

30:58.240 --> 31:01.520
Back then, Porsche was
a tiny cash-starved outfit,

31:01.560 --> 31:04.680
nothing like the prosperous
company we know today.

31:04.720 --> 31:09.160
But Piech was so consumed
with scoring an outright win
at Le Mans

31:09.200 --> 31:13.600
that he decided he was going
to build those 25 cars,

31:13.640 --> 31:18.320
even though the next Le Mans
was only a few months away.

31:18.360 --> 31:20.720
So, everybody,
and I do mean everybody -

31:20.760 --> 31:23.920
the accountants, managers,
office juniors, secretaries -

31:23.960 --> 31:25.880
they were all hauled away
from their desks

31:25.920 --> 31:28.840
to go down to
the production line and work
on getting those cars ready.

31:28.880 --> 31:32.720
They actually became known
as the "secretary cars".

31:34.440 --> 31:37.960
The ragtag Porsche team
just made the deadline,

31:38.000 --> 31:41.600
and the motorsport inspectors
gave the road cars
the sign-off,

31:41.640 --> 31:44.320
presumably not inspecting
them too closely

31:44.360 --> 31:48.360
or they would have noticed
that most of them
had truck axles.

31:49.600 --> 31:51.320
(ENGINE ROARING)

31:51.360 --> 31:55.440
With the green light
given for Porsche
to enter the Le Mans race,

31:55.480 --> 32:00.200
Piech got to work getting
some cars ready in time.

32:00.240 --> 32:03.280
Now, on the plus side,
they were blindingly fast.

32:03.320 --> 32:07.960
One car clocked 238
on the Mulsanne Straight.

32:09.920 --> 32:14.000
On the downside, though, they
were terrifyingly unstable

32:14.040 --> 32:16.360
and virtually undriveable.

32:16.400 --> 32:18.600
The drivers
simply didn't know

32:18.640 --> 32:20.360
what the car
was going to do next.

32:20.400 --> 32:22.600
There was so much
chassis flex

32:22.640 --> 32:25.520
that the gear lever
would move around
all over the place.

32:25.560 --> 32:28.800
They'd make a gear change,
put their hand there
the next time,

32:28.840 --> 32:30.360
and it'd be
somewhere else.

32:32.640 --> 32:36.680
Piech hoped for a big win
at the 1969 Le Mans race,

32:36.720 --> 32:40.960
but it was a disaster.

32:41.000 --> 32:44.800
One of the privately-entered
cars crashed on lap one,

32:44.840 --> 32:47.520
killing its driver.

32:47.560 --> 32:50.440
The others broke down
as the race wore on

32:50.480 --> 32:54.680
until just one remained,
driven by this man,

32:54.720 --> 32:57.480
British driver
Dickie Attwood.

32:57.520 --> 33:00.320
"Difficult" would be,
er, putting it mildly.

33:00.360 --> 33:04.960
Um... er, "life-threatening"
could be another one.

33:05.000 --> 33:06.120
-Um...
-Right.

33:06.160 --> 33:09.280
It was, um, a monster.

33:10.560 --> 33:12.600
It was made for speed,

33:12.640 --> 33:14.640
like a bullet,
to go through the air,

33:14.680 --> 33:17.600
but the, er, there wasn't
enough pressure
on the bodywork

33:17.640 --> 33:19.440
to keep it on the ground.

33:19.480 --> 33:22.920
And so the faster you went,
the more unstable it was.

33:22.960 --> 33:25.160
-(ENGINE REVVING)
-It was so horrendous,

33:25.200 --> 33:28.200
I was waiting, hopefully,
that the car would break.

33:28.240 --> 33:31.040
And eventually it did.

33:31.080 --> 33:33.480
But it was 21 hours
before it broke.

33:33.520 --> 33:37.280
We were six laps in the lead,
so we hadn't got far to go.

33:37.320 --> 33:42.400
But I was, I was happy
the car broke.

33:42.440 --> 33:46.960
Undeterred, Porsche hired
British race engineer
John Wyre,

33:47.000 --> 33:49.560
who'd helped to develop
the Ford GT40,

33:49.600 --> 33:52.920
to sort out
the 917's evil handling.

33:52.960 --> 33:54.920
And he cracked the problem,

33:54.960 --> 33:58.120
with a little help
from Mother Nature.

33:58.160 --> 34:00.560
After one really long
test session,

34:00.600 --> 34:03.720
Wyre and his drivers noticed
that although
the front of the car

34:03.760 --> 34:05.840
was absolutely plastered
in dead bugs,

34:05.880 --> 34:08.200
there were none here
on the rear wing,

34:08.240 --> 34:10.960
which must have meant the air
wasn't flowing over it,

34:11.000 --> 34:12.920
and it wasn't producing
any downforce,

34:12.960 --> 34:16.840
and it wasn't pressing
the car down into the track.

34:16.880 --> 34:20.200
Having reworked
the aerodynamics
of their problem child,

34:20.280 --> 34:25.040
Porsche arrived at
the 1970 Le Mans race
with renewed hope

34:25.080 --> 34:29.560
and Dickie Attwood
once more at the wheel.

34:29.600 --> 34:33.120
During the race, the 917s
were blisteringly fast -

34:33.160 --> 34:34.960
as ever -

34:35.000 --> 34:39.400
but this time, mercifully,
they were much more stable.

34:39.440 --> 34:43.120
And although heavy rain
claimed victim after victim,

34:43.160 --> 34:46.160
Attwood and the 917
took the chequered flag

34:46.200 --> 34:50.000
and gave Porsche their first
ever outright win at Le Mans.

34:50.040 --> 34:53.360
(CHEERING)

34:53.400 --> 34:55.120
It was a win
they badly needed,

34:55.160 --> 34:56.960
because they had,
quite literally,

34:57.000 --> 34:59.200
gambled the company on it.

35:00.920 --> 35:02.680
It's also true to say
that this car

35:02.760 --> 35:04.800
nearly broke Porsche,
as well, didn't it?

35:04.840 --> 35:06.680
Because they were
a very small company.

35:06.760 --> 35:08.800
It did. Um...

35:08.840 --> 35:10.760
Again, it was Ferdinand Piech

35:10.800 --> 35:14.160
and, er, he was a guy
who was, um, quite extreme.

35:14.160 --> 35:18.280
He was so enthused
to do what he's done that

35:18.320 --> 35:20.160
that nearly
broke the company, it did.

35:20.160 --> 35:24.120
Yeah, the racing programme
nearly destroyed Porsche.

35:24.160 --> 35:27.960
From then on,
there was no stopping the 917

35:28.000 --> 35:31.960
as it set about building
its own legend.

35:32.000 --> 35:33.640
The following year
at Le Mans,

35:33.680 --> 35:35.640
on the way
to another crushing victory,

35:35.680 --> 35:37.320
it would go through
the speed traps

35:37.360 --> 35:41.120
at over 241 miles an hour,

35:41.160 --> 35:45.160
a record that stood
for more than 20 years.

35:45.200 --> 35:47.760
And in that same race,
it was so fast

35:47.800 --> 35:52.760
it would cover
a total of 3,315 miles,

35:52.800 --> 35:57.520
a distance record
that would stand until 2010.

35:57.560 --> 35:58.800
(CHEERING)

35:58.840 --> 36:00.320
And if that wasn't enough,

36:00.360 --> 36:03.280
Hollywood's greatest
petrolhead, Steve McQueen,

36:03.320 --> 36:07.520
came to Le Mans and made
the 917 a screen icon.

36:13.640 --> 36:17.440
And now, since
the legend is celebrating
its 50th birthday,

36:17.480 --> 36:20.520
I think it deserves
a fun day out.

36:22.600 --> 36:27.040
So, I thought,
why don't we put
Mr Dickie Attwood back in it

36:27.080 --> 36:29.640
to stretch its legs a bit
and spice things up,

36:29.640 --> 36:32.960
and whilst he's there, let's
see how the old legend -

36:33.000 --> 36:37.000
I mean the car - stacks up
against a modern Porsche.

36:37.040 --> 36:39.680
-(ENGINE ROARING)
-Specifically, this Porsche,

36:39.760 --> 36:42.800
the 911 GT2 RS,

36:42.840 --> 36:46.600
the biggest gun
in Porsche's current arsenal.

36:48.840 --> 36:50.640
Now, attentive viewers
will have noticed

36:50.640 --> 36:52.880
that I'm not
actually driving,

36:52.920 --> 36:55.040
and that's because I've
decided to do this properly.

36:55.080 --> 36:58.800
We're going to have old
Porsche Le Mans-winning
racing driver

36:58.840 --> 37:02.200
versus young Porsche Le
Mans-winning racing driver,

37:02.280 --> 37:07.880
because this is Neel Jani,
and he won for Porsche
in 2016 in the 919.

37:07.920 --> 37:11.120
To be honest,
he's also probably a bit
better at this than I am.

37:12.200 --> 37:13.920
As for the cars themselves,

37:13.960 --> 37:17.280
on paper,
it's a tough one to call.

37:17.320 --> 37:19.440
We have 700 horsepower
in here,

37:19.480 --> 37:22.360
621 horsepower in the 917.

37:22.400 --> 37:25.600
But the 917 weighs
just 800 kilograms.

37:25.640 --> 37:29.160
This weighs 1,830 kilograms.

37:29.200 --> 37:31.080
It's over a tonne heavier.

37:31.120 --> 37:33.960
But then again,
we've got modern tyres
and we've got modern brakes,

37:34.000 --> 37:35.640
and we have a modern gearbox
with paddles.

37:35.680 --> 37:40.440
So, I mean, God knows.
Let's find out.

37:40.480 --> 37:45.000
What I hadn't considered
in my comparisons...
was Dickie.

37:45.040 --> 37:47.600
(GEAR CLICKS
AND ENGINE ROARS)

37:47.640 --> 37:49.200
Whoa, cheeky!

37:51.200 --> 37:53.160
Look how bloody fast
he's going.

37:55.200 --> 37:56.960
The man's a loon. He's 78.

37:59.680 --> 38:01.960
He's going quick, huh?

38:02.000 --> 38:04.280
Carrying a massive amount
of speed in the corner.

38:07.360 --> 38:09.160
Here we go.

38:09.160 --> 38:11.640
Have him!

38:11.640 --> 38:13.440
-(TYRES SCREECH)
-Whoa!

38:15.160 --> 38:17.000
(LAUGHS)

38:17.040 --> 38:19.040
So, the red mist
has descended again,

38:19.080 --> 38:22.040
after a pause
of nearly half a century,

38:22.080 --> 38:24.280
and Mr Attwood
has gone quite mad.

38:29.440 --> 38:30.920
Oh, yes, this could be it.

38:33.000 --> 38:35.440
Yes... Oh, no!

38:35.480 --> 38:37.280
Ah, he's had you!

38:37.320 --> 38:38.520
(LAUGHS)

38:38.560 --> 38:39.760
Ah, you can't
quite out-brake him

38:39.800 --> 38:40.960
cos you're too heavy.

38:41.000 --> 38:43.080
But in the end,

38:43.120 --> 38:46.680
youth and modern rubber
triumph over the flat hat.

38:46.760 --> 38:48.800
Oh, we're right all...
We're all over his tail.

38:48.840 --> 38:51.640
Here we go.

38:51.640 --> 38:53.600
-Oh, ho-ho!
-(ENGINES ROARING)

38:58.280 --> 38:59.760
Yes!

39:02.520 --> 39:04.000
Nicely done, sir.

39:04.040 --> 39:06.000
Lucky. I can keep my job.

39:06.040 --> 39:07.800
Yeah, I think
you can keep your job.

39:11.960 --> 39:13.880
(APPLAUSE DROWNS CHATTER)

39:16.640 --> 39:19.120
-What a hero.
-Oh, I love Dickie Attwood.

39:19.160 --> 39:21.520
-Fabulous.
-Oh, yeah,
Dickie Attwood, what a man.

39:21.560 --> 39:22.960
Really good.

39:23.000 --> 39:26.480
So, you see, James,
some old men can drive fast.

39:26.520 --> 39:28.560
-Just saying.
-I didn't realise...

39:28.600 --> 39:30.920
You know the Ferdinand Piech
who did the 917?

39:30.960 --> 39:34.800
He went on, years later,
to do the Bugatti Veyron,
didn't he?

39:34.840 --> 39:36.800
Yes, he did, exactly right.
And before that,

39:36.840 --> 39:39.640
he did the Audi Quattro,
the original one,

39:39.680 --> 39:42.320
and his grandfather,
obviously, he did the Beetle,

39:42.360 --> 39:45.160
and his cousin,
I think it was, did the 911.

39:45.160 --> 39:46.800
Yeah, his cousin Ferdinand.

39:46.840 --> 39:49.080
They were all
called Ferdinand.
It's a true fact, this.

39:49.120 --> 39:51.160
Porsche was started
by Ferdinand,

39:51.200 --> 39:54.840
who had a son
who took over the company,
and he was called Ferdinand.

39:54.880 --> 39:57.160
And then he handed it
on to his son,

39:57.160 --> 39:59.560
who was called Ferdinand,
and he did the 911.

39:59.600 --> 40:02.320
-They're all Ferdinand.
-Yeah, but the second
Ferdinand--

40:02.360 --> 40:03.680
-Yeah.
-He had a sister.

40:03.760 --> 40:05.200
-Called Ferdinand.
-No.

40:05.280 --> 40:07.480
-(LAUGHTER)
-She was called Louise.

40:07.520 --> 40:10.040
And she had a daughter
called Louise.

40:10.080 --> 40:12.160
-There's a surprise.
-And a son called Ferdinand.

40:12.200 --> 40:14.320
That was Ferdinand Piech
who we were looking at there.

40:14.360 --> 40:15.600
Exactly right,
who did that car.

40:15.640 --> 40:17.600
There's no wonder, really,
that the 911 never changes,

40:17.640 --> 40:19.360
cos that family's got
no imagination.

40:19.400 --> 40:21.880
-(LAUGHTER)
-"What shall we call our son?"

40:21.920 --> 40:24.040
"Hmm, I'm thinking
Ferdinand."

40:24.080 --> 40:26.560
Want to guess what Ferdinand
Piech's son was called?

40:26.600 --> 40:28.560
-Colin?
-No, no, it was Ferdinand.

40:28.600 --> 40:29.920
-Was it?
-It was, yeah.

40:29.960 --> 40:32.160
There is a surprise.
There is a surprise.

40:32.160 --> 40:34.120
Anyway, let's move it on,
shall we?

40:34.160 --> 40:36.280
Yep, let's move it on. As you
would probably imagine,

40:36.320 --> 40:39.000
we have to travel a lot
to make this show.

40:39.040 --> 40:40.960
I mean, just in making
this series alone,

40:41.000 --> 40:44.040
we have been to Colombia,
Detroit, Las Vegas,

40:44.080 --> 40:46.080
Scotland, Tbilisi, Baku,

40:46.120 --> 40:49.160
Istanbul, Helsinki,
and Chongqing,

40:49.200 --> 40:52.560
Mongolia, Hong Kong,
Florida, Spain,

40:52.600 --> 40:55.160
France, Italy, Switzerland.

40:55.160 --> 40:56.800
That's just to make
13 programmes.

40:56.840 --> 40:58.000
Yeah, and we're not
making that up.

40:58.040 --> 40:59.600
We genuinely have
been that far.

40:59.640 --> 41:02.040
And that means we have to
go through a lot of airports.

41:02.080 --> 41:03.880
And almost all of them
drive us mad

41:03.920 --> 41:06.600
for a number of small
reasons, and one big one.

41:06.640 --> 41:08.280
-Yeah. You.
-What?

41:08.320 --> 41:09.840
-(LAUGHTER)
-Well, you.

41:09.880 --> 41:11.080
We have to travel
with you everywhere,

41:11.120 --> 41:13.320
and you never stop
ranting about it.

41:13.360 --> 41:15.000
I do a little bit
of that, yeah.

41:15.040 --> 41:16.600
-A little bit?
-Yeah.

41:16.640 --> 41:18.440
The first 20 minutes of
the film we're about to see

41:18.480 --> 41:20.480
are just rant before
we even get to the point.

41:20.520 --> 41:21.680
Yeah, that is true.

41:21.760 --> 41:25.320
But it's worth it,
as you shall see.

41:25.360 --> 41:28.440
JEREMY: This is London
Stansted Airport,

41:28.480 --> 41:31.640
which is located
nowhere near London.

41:34.680 --> 41:37.360
Here we are,
Wetherspoons with runways,

41:37.400 --> 41:40.480
and miles of tape
to make your life worse.

41:40.520 --> 41:42.840
And why do they need
a two-hour check-in?

41:42.880 --> 41:45.960
I mean, two hours
to get my suitcase
from the check-in desk

41:46.000 --> 41:48.960
to just behind
that wall over there,
which is where the plane is.

41:49.000 --> 41:50.440
Go on. Two hours!

41:50.480 --> 41:52.760
I could almost get it
back to London in two hours.

41:52.800 --> 41:55.160
-(SCANNER BEEPING)
-Oh, good, security.

41:55.200 --> 41:56.680
Time to take
all my clothes off

41:56.760 --> 41:58.600
and give someone
my toothpaste.

41:58.640 --> 42:00.560
And, do you know,
the worst thing is,

42:00.600 --> 42:04.880
I mean, the idiocy
of people in these queues
just beggars belief.

42:04.920 --> 42:07.160
Look at her shoes.
You seen her? Look at her.

42:07.200 --> 42:09.160
She looks like Elton John
in Tommy.

42:09.160 --> 42:11.520
It's going to take her three
hours to take each one off.

42:11.560 --> 42:13.600
And take your laptops
out now,

42:13.640 --> 42:16.480
while you're in the queue,
not when you get there.

42:16.520 --> 42:21.000
I came here on a train,
2,000 people on it,
and no security at all.

42:21.040 --> 42:23.760
Going on an aeroplane.
Wooh. Well, we'll do this.

42:23.800 --> 42:25.760
-(BEEPING)
-And then, of course,

42:25.800 --> 42:28.280
is your bag
going to be selected
for a special search?

42:28.320 --> 42:31.320
Of course it is.
All... Yes, there you go.

42:31.360 --> 42:33.440
You've been through
an X-ray machine.

42:33.480 --> 42:36.120
If you go to a hospital
and you X-ray somebody's leg,

42:36.160 --> 42:39.360
OK, you say, "Right, it's not
broken, I can see that,

42:39.400 --> 42:42.160
but let's just cut your flesh
open to make sure."

42:42.200 --> 42:44.400
It... They know.
It's been X-rayed.

42:44.440 --> 42:46.640
Why are they looking at it
again? Oh, here we go.

42:46.640 --> 42:48.600
-Yeah, salt.
-(PLASTIC RUSTLING)

42:48.640 --> 42:50.960
Self-raising flour.

Normal flour.

42:52.560 --> 42:53.800
(BEEPING NEARBY)

42:53.840 --> 42:56.480
Baking powder. Talcum powder.

42:56.520 --> 42:58.880
That's for
my athlete's foot.

42:58.920 --> 43:00.320
I've put them in clear bags.

43:00.360 --> 43:02.000
Every single airport

43:02.040 --> 43:04.120
you go through
anywhere in the world,

43:04.160 --> 43:07.840
why are they so interested
in my condiments
and medical necessities?

43:07.880 --> 43:09.560
-I mean...
-I don't know, mate.

43:10.640 --> 43:12.600
And then you're
out of security

43:12.640 --> 43:14.160
and straight into a shop,

43:14.160 --> 43:15.960
which wouldn't be
so bad

43:16.000 --> 43:17.760
if it sold something
you actually wanted,

43:17.800 --> 43:19.280
like bog roll or cat food.

43:19.320 --> 43:21.800
But, no,
all they sell is perfume.

43:21.840 --> 43:23.920
Why do they think,
when you get to an airport,

43:23.960 --> 43:26.920
"Oh, right, I'm suddenly
overcome with a need

43:26.960 --> 43:29.280
to smell like
Victoria Beckham"?

43:29.320 --> 43:32.160
Then you've got the adverts.
Look at that halfwit.

43:32.160 --> 43:34.560
Look at him.

43:34.600 --> 43:37.760
Every advert in every airport
makes no sense.

43:37.800 --> 43:40.360
And then you have
these moronic slogans

43:40.400 --> 43:42.840
from companies that do things
you don't understand.

43:42.880 --> 43:45.400
"Manage your infrastructure
like a visionary,

43:45.440 --> 43:47.160
not a functionary."

43:47.200 --> 43:49.560
What's that mean?
Might as well say,

43:49.600 --> 43:53.560
"Manage your infrastructure
like a visionary,
not a shoplifter."

43:53.600 --> 43:55.720
There's a shop at Heathrow

43:55.760 --> 43:59.120
that sells
a life-size pot horse.

43:59.160 --> 44:01.480
I mean, who, when they're
about to get on an aeroplane,

44:01.520 --> 44:03.400
goes, "Yes, that's exactly
what I need,

44:03.440 --> 44:07.320
a brittle, fragile pot horse
to lumber about"?

44:07.360 --> 44:11.680
I'm going to start
an airline called
"I'll Take My Chances Air".

44:11.720 --> 44:14.120
You turn up, get on
the plane, it takes off.

44:14.160 --> 44:17.160
Nobody on board
smells like Victoria Beckham.

44:17.200 --> 44:20.320
No security, nothing.
If it blows up, it blows up.

44:20.360 --> 44:22.680
Not that you can say "blows
up" in an airport these days

44:22.720 --> 44:24.760
cos then you have to go
to prison for 400 years.

44:24.800 --> 44:27.880
Why is she wearing
a tracksuit?

44:27.920 --> 44:30.040
Well, so she can
be comfortable.

44:30.080 --> 44:32.200
She's not going
on a fighter jet.

44:32.240 --> 44:34.080
She's going to Spain.
There's no g.

44:34.120 --> 44:36.600
Well, there's one.
Well, I mean there's 1g now.

44:36.640 --> 44:38.760
I'm not thinking,
"Ooh, these jeans
are really uncomfortable,

44:38.800 --> 44:41.200
I wish I'd worn a kaftan."

44:41.240 --> 44:45.120
And all those, they're the
amuse-bouche of the problems
you have at an airport.

44:45.160 --> 44:47.680
Now it's time
for the really big one -

44:47.720 --> 44:50.080
the distance to the gate.

44:50.120 --> 44:52.800
-This never ends.
-Of course it doesn't end.

44:52.840 --> 44:54.200
-Oh, God.
-Look at that.

44:54.240 --> 44:56.400
Ten-minute walk to gates.

44:56.440 --> 44:58.280
There's no such thing
as a ten-minute walk.

44:58.320 --> 45:00.680
Nobody walks for ten minutes.

45:00.720 --> 45:03.640
Well, I mean,
an ape would or a wildebeest,
but not a human being.

45:03.680 --> 45:05.440
Ten-minute walk!

45:05.480 --> 45:08.280
The distance from
the bag drop here,

45:08.320 --> 45:12.120
to this gate we're going to,
is 1.2 kilometres.

45:12.160 --> 45:16.520
In Atlanta, the walk
to the furthest gate
is two kilometres.

45:16.560 --> 45:18.840
In Beijing, it's two miles!

45:18.880 --> 45:21.640
The astonishing miracle
is that, so far,

45:21.680 --> 45:23.360
I haven't actually been
run over

45:23.400 --> 45:26.360
by one of those karts going,
"Beep, beep, beep, beep.

45:26.400 --> 45:29.080
Warning.
Fat bastard on board."

45:29.120 --> 45:31.520
And then you get to a corner,
and is it the end?

45:31.560 --> 45:35.040
No, there's another mile
of corridor to get down.

45:35.080 --> 45:37.040
No-one in the history
of aviation

45:37.080 --> 45:38.800
has ever flown
from gate one.

45:38.840 --> 45:41.000
There are no gate ones
anywhere in the world.

45:41.040 --> 45:43.400
"Here's your ticket.
Gate 374."

45:43.440 --> 45:45.760
Where's gate one?

45:45.800 --> 45:51.280
I can see now
why James May volunteered
not to be in this film.

45:51.320 --> 45:52.960
And, finally,
you get to the gate,

45:53.000 --> 45:55.240
which is so far
from civilisation

45:55.280 --> 45:57.920
they're still using
a dot matrix printer.

45:57.960 --> 46:01.120
We have explained to him
that the walk
has to be this long

46:01.160 --> 46:05.000
because aeroplanes are wide
because they've got wings,

46:05.040 --> 46:07.680
but he can't seem to
understand the concept.

46:07.720 --> 46:11.760
Look, you will admit that
that was a long walk, yes?

46:11.800 --> 46:14.040
I don't care what the reason
is, it's a long walk.

46:14.080 --> 46:19.440
-It is quite a stretch, yes.
-Which is why we decided
to address the problem.

46:19.480 --> 46:21.160
Shut him up.

46:23.200 --> 46:26.360
JEREMY: So, here we are
arriving at the airport again

46:26.400 --> 46:29.080
with what looks like
normal hand luggage.

46:29.120 --> 46:31.120
OK, what I have here,
as you can see,

46:31.160 --> 46:33.200
is a perfectly ordinary
wheeled suitcase.

46:33.240 --> 46:35.040
If I fold the handle away,

46:35.080 --> 46:37.080
it will fit in
an overhead locker.

46:37.120 --> 46:39.920
However, if I lay it down,
like so,

46:39.960 --> 46:43.520
you can see...
starting to look like a car.

46:43.560 --> 46:45.400
-Not really, mate.
-No, it is.

46:45.440 --> 46:49.320
And it will look even more
like a car when I have
completed the build.

46:49.360 --> 46:51.280
Simply open it up.

46:51.320 --> 46:53.200
As you can see,
all the things I need

46:53.240 --> 46:55.440
for a couple of nights away
are in there.

46:55.480 --> 46:56.960
It is actually a suitcase.

46:57.000 --> 47:00.600
But also in here is,
um, a steering wheel.

47:00.640 --> 47:02.480
So, shut that up...
(GROANS)

47:02.520 --> 47:05.000
Yeah, you put your shirt
over your steering wheel.

47:05.040 --> 47:07.120
-It's not my shirt,
it's my jacket.
-Oh, I'm sorry.

47:07.160 --> 47:12.600
Just move it off the steering
column, zip it up.

47:12.640 --> 47:14.600
-Right, and then...
-(CLICKS)

47:14.640 --> 47:18.280
You heard that. A solid click
like an M16 rifle bolt.

47:18.320 --> 47:21.800
This is my accelerator,
my brake,

47:21.840 --> 47:24.200
and then I simply...
sitting on it,

47:24.240 --> 47:27.680
being quite careful to keep
that away from...my plums.

47:27.720 --> 47:29.720
And I am ready to go.

47:29.760 --> 47:31.560
-So, where's yours?
-Here.

47:31.600 --> 47:33.840
-This is it. Laptop.
-Yeah.

47:33.880 --> 47:35.800
Put it on the floor.

47:35.840 --> 47:38.080
-Wheeled laptop?
-Oh, yeah.

47:38.120 --> 47:40.200
-Yeah, but...
Oh, I see, you stand on it.
-Yeah.

47:40.240 --> 47:41.720
And I'm off.

47:41.760 --> 47:43.880
-So where's your luggage?
-In my pocket.

47:43.920 --> 47:46.760
I got pants, toothbrush,
everything I need.

47:46.800 --> 47:48.120
I'm good to go.

47:48.160 --> 47:50.000
Hammond, that does look
a bit dangerous.

47:50.040 --> 47:52.080
-It is.
-(LAUGHS)

47:52.120 --> 47:53.960
That's why I'm wearing
all these pads.

47:54.000 --> 47:58.080
Right, are we ready, then,
to revolutionise air travel?

47:58.120 --> 48:01.840
Yeah. The worst bit
about every working day
is about to get better.

48:01.880 --> 48:03.480
Let's do this.

48:04.880 --> 48:07.160
The speed!

48:08.480 --> 48:10.480
-(THUD)
-Oh, shit.

48:10.520 --> 48:12.400
I may have hit
the other sign as well.

48:12.440 --> 48:15.080
-My brakes aren't
as good as I thought.
-I hit the big sign.

48:17.400 --> 48:19.680
RICHARD: Another advantage
of this, I am tall.

48:19.720 --> 48:22.560
-I reckon I'm 5'11" on this.
-There's been a bit
of a role reversal.

48:22.600 --> 48:24.400
RICHARD: It's good.
-I've got to be honest
with you.

48:24.440 --> 48:27.920
In a matter of moments,
we arrived at the check-in.

48:27.960 --> 48:29.880
This is a good test.

48:32.680 --> 48:34.080
Yes.

48:35.200 --> 48:38.320
I'm not a sheep,
I'm not a sheep.

48:38.360 --> 48:41.680
-I have solved customs.
-(CLATTERING)

48:41.720 --> 48:43.240
-(CLUNK)
-Ah! Hello.

48:43.280 --> 48:45.960
-Sorry about that.
-Sorry.
-Ow.

48:46.000 --> 48:47.880
-Are you checking in a bag?
-No.

48:47.920 --> 48:50.480
-He's on it.
-I have it here. It's here.

48:50.520 --> 48:52.480
-He's not normally that tall.
-Shut up.

48:54.240 --> 48:56.160
-(BEEPING)
JEREMY: Into security.

48:57.360 --> 48:59.440
-(THUD)
-Oh, God, my foot.

48:59.480 --> 49:00.960
Sorry.

49:01.000 --> 49:02.720
-Sorry. Sorry.
-That was my other foot.

49:02.760 --> 49:04.680
-Yep, that happened.
-(BLEEPING)

49:06.880 --> 49:09.320
Can you, er, take out
your laptop, please?

49:09.360 --> 49:11.640
Well, no, it is a laptop.
Look, that's it.

49:11.680 --> 49:13.320
-It's a laptop.
-It's a laptop with wheels.

49:13.360 --> 49:15.560
-Yeah, that's it, simple.
-That's a steering wheel.

49:15.600 --> 49:18.960
-And what's that?
-Car.

49:19.000 --> 49:21.560
-Oh, God.
Just got to get undressed.
-Yeah, yeah.

49:21.600 --> 49:24.400
-Do you want to see
my penis?
-Um, whoa, not right now.

49:24.440 --> 49:26.080
There you go.

49:26.120 --> 49:29.000
(BEEPING)

49:29.040 --> 49:30.800
Thanks. Bet you never had
a steering wheel

49:30.840 --> 49:32.600
go through customs before,
have you?

49:32.640 --> 49:34.000
Ooh, ah.

49:34.040 --> 49:38.080
-Right, onwards.
-(WHIRRING)

49:38.120 --> 49:40.800
I actually have nine wheels
on my suitcase,

49:40.840 --> 49:42.320
not counting this one.

49:42.360 --> 49:43.960
Oh, that was...
That was... Ha-ha.

49:44.000 --> 49:46.680
That was a bad mistake.
Ah. Ha-ha.

49:46.720 --> 49:48.200
Yeah, sorry.

49:51.680 --> 49:55.320
JEREMY: Soon we were motoring
through the duty-free shops.

49:58.040 --> 50:01.120
This works
by leaning to steer it.

50:01.160 --> 50:04.120
It runs on what are,
I believe, called "trucks",

50:04.160 --> 50:05.920
which are the little wheels
under skateboards,

50:05.960 --> 50:07.960
and they...they go
in the direction you lean.

50:08.000 --> 50:10.800
Coming through.
(GASPS) Oh, sorry, madam.

50:10.840 --> 50:14.280
I think it'd be better
if it made a noise.

50:14.320 --> 50:17.280
-Hello, this is the future.
-I want one!

50:17.320 --> 50:19.200
You're dragging your suitcase

50:19.240 --> 50:21.240
instead of using it
to get you to the gate.

50:23.320 --> 50:26.720
Oh. Beep, beep, beep.

50:26.760 --> 50:30.560
Sorry, I've... Sorry, I...
Thank you.

50:30.600 --> 50:33.240
In full power mode, I have a
top speed of 28 miles an hour

50:33.280 --> 50:35.200
but I'm not using that

50:35.240 --> 50:37.800
because in full power mode,
you have no steering at all.

50:37.840 --> 50:39.160
No, no, no, no, no!

50:39.200 --> 50:41.760
-(THUD AND CLATTERING)
-Oh, sorry, mate...

50:41.800 --> 50:44.240
RICHARD: Er, Jeremy,
you've killed a man!

50:44.280 --> 50:47.280
-Oh, shit, no!
-Oh, Hammond's gone!

50:47.320 --> 50:49.880
(HE GROANS) Ow.

50:49.920 --> 50:52.640
-I meant that.
-He's gone!

50:52.680 --> 50:56.800
JEREMY: Eventually, though,
I started to get the hang
of my machine.

50:56.840 --> 50:58.800
Handbrake turn.

50:58.840 --> 51:01.400
(HE CHUCKLES) Hammond!

51:01.440 --> 51:03.480
-What?
-I'm drifting a suitcase.

51:03.520 --> 51:06.200
This is more like
a race track than a shop.

51:06.240 --> 51:08.080
Oh, shit!

51:09.880 --> 51:11.280
Oh, sh...

51:12.960 --> 51:15.600
Can somebody do... This is...
Where's the manager?

51:15.640 --> 51:18.120
This was like this
when we got here.

51:18.160 --> 51:20.480
OK, we could try
and rebuild it, or...

51:20.520 --> 51:22.800
Going to have to rebuild it.

51:22.840 --> 51:25.280
Actually,
genuinely hurt my leg.

51:25.320 --> 51:26.960
Not that you're bothered.

51:27.000 --> 51:28.600
I'm bothered
when you hurt yourself,

51:28.640 --> 51:30.440
which is every time
you get in a moving vehicle.

51:30.480 --> 51:33.200
How bothered are you?
I genuinely have hurt
my ankle.

51:33.240 --> 51:35.040
You're not going to get
an air ambulance trip

51:35.080 --> 51:37.160
out of crashing into
some chocolate bars.

51:37.200 --> 51:41.000
Soon, we decided
that instead of rebuilding
the Toblerone mountain...

51:42.920 --> 51:46.760
we should use the time
we'd made up having a drink.

51:46.800 --> 51:49.520
(FLIGHT ANNOUNCEMENT
IN BACKGROUND)

51:49.560 --> 51:51.480
JEREMY: Ah!
-(THUD)

51:51.520 --> 51:54.600
-(CLATTERING)
-Sorry!

51:54.640 --> 51:56.160
Oh, God. Um...

51:56.200 --> 51:57.920
Can I have...
Er, sorry about that.

51:57.960 --> 52:00.400
It's... difficult to stop.

52:00.440 --> 52:01.960
Um... What do you want?

52:02.000 --> 52:03.360
Er, I'll have
a gin and tonic.

52:03.400 --> 52:04.680
Two gin and tonics, please.

52:07.320 --> 52:10.240
So, it's a skateboard
with a cordless drill motor,

52:10.280 --> 52:12.400
and then it gets its power
from the laptop batteries?

52:12.440 --> 52:14.560
-And that's really a...
-Yeah. Laptop. It works.

52:14.600 --> 52:16.640
There's my laptop.

52:16.680 --> 52:19.000
That's actually quite clever.

52:19.040 --> 52:21.000
The way we have
to look at it is, yes,

52:21.040 --> 52:23.240
there was a small accident
with the Toblerone,

52:23.280 --> 52:25.240
-and I did kill a man.
-You did.

52:25.280 --> 52:27.880
But other than those
minor drawbacks,
I think we're going well.

52:27.920 --> 52:30.160
I mean, when have we ever,
in all of our travels,

52:30.200 --> 52:32.320
stopped for a gin and tonic
at an airport?

52:32.360 --> 52:34.920
Never ever had time
to do that.

52:34.960 --> 52:36.360
JEREMY:
Having finished our drinks,

52:36.400 --> 52:40.280
we set off into
the warren of walkways.

52:40.320 --> 52:44.240
This meant I could finally
unleash my suitcase-mobile.

52:49.240 --> 52:51.560
The speeeed!

52:52.760 --> 52:55.600
Oh, rides like a Tesla.

52:55.640 --> 52:57.320
Hello. Ooh, ha.

52:57.360 --> 53:00.920
Enjoying your walk?
(CHUCKLES)

53:00.960 --> 53:04.280
Hammond, meanwhile,
had decided to use
the travellator.

53:04.320 --> 53:06.080
Yeah.

53:06.120 --> 53:08.600
I'm saving laptop batteries
by doing this.

53:08.640 --> 53:10.320
Just... Oh, no,
hang on a minute.

53:12.080 --> 53:14.760
How am I going to
get off the end of this?

53:14.800 --> 53:16.680
Wait. I'm in reverse.

53:16.720 --> 53:19.240
So I can stay...
I'm stationary,
but only cos I'm in reverse.

53:19.280 --> 53:20.880
Um...

53:20.920 --> 53:25.440
If you just stride,
stride, stride, stride. Um...

53:26.920 --> 53:29.320
Having eventually reunited...

53:29.360 --> 53:32.040
Out of the way.

53:32.080 --> 53:34.360
...we arrived
at the departure gate

53:34.400 --> 53:37.160
feeling fresh and calm.

53:37.200 --> 53:40.120
Nothing to see here.
Nothing to see.

53:40.160 --> 53:42.160
Is it gate 88, Hammond?

53:42.200 --> 53:44.080
What? No, mate,
it's this one.

53:46.520 --> 53:47.840
There's no plane!

53:50.240 --> 53:52.360
(THUDDING AND CLATTERING)

53:55.160 --> 53:56.720
(HE WINCES)

53:56.760 --> 53:59.160
And on that
terrible disappointment,

53:59.200 --> 54:00.880
back to the tent.

54:00.920 --> 54:03.480
-(APPLAUSE)
RICHARD: I liked that bit.

54:03.520 --> 54:05.480
-I enjoyed that bit.
-(CHEERING)

54:07.760 --> 54:09.880
That was quite hurty.

54:11.320 --> 54:13.120
Right, we know
how his works. I...

54:13.160 --> 54:14.880
I just...
I fell out of a tunnel!

54:14.920 --> 54:17.360
I'm not interested in that. I
want to know how yours works.

54:17.400 --> 54:20.920
Well, it's exactly the same.
It was a cordless drill motor
and some laptop batteries.

54:20.960 --> 54:22.920
Right, and you're claiming
that has a top speed

54:22.960 --> 54:24.440
of 28 miles an hour?

54:24.480 --> 54:26.920
I was doing 28 when I fell
out of the tunnel.

54:26.960 --> 54:28.640
-Really?
-Yes, 28.

54:28.680 --> 54:30.000
I didn't believe him either,

54:30.040 --> 54:31.600
so when the airport
quietened down a bit,

54:31.640 --> 54:34.480
-we organised a race.
-Yeah, we did.
We got some drivers.

54:34.520 --> 54:36.800
I got Abbie
to ride my suitcase.

54:36.840 --> 54:40.280
Yep, and my laptop
was ridden by Aaron Davis,

54:40.320 --> 54:43.840
the second fastest young
skateboarder in Britain,

54:43.880 --> 54:45.640
and you can't get
better than that.

54:45.680 --> 54:48.440
-Well... You can.
-(LAUGHTER)

54:48.480 --> 54:50.320
You can get the fastest,
but I didn't.

54:50.360 --> 54:52.400
Anyway, you didn't.
Who wants to see the race?

54:52.440 --> 54:54.280
AUDIENCE: Yes!
-OK, play the tape.

54:55.840 --> 54:58.200
(TANNOY CHIME)

54:58.240 --> 55:02.480
JEREMY: Right, here's Abbie
on my superb suitcase.

55:02.520 --> 55:05.800
And here's Hammond's man
on the laptop.

55:05.840 --> 55:08.760
And now...
let's see what happens.

55:08.800 --> 55:11.520
Three, two, one.

55:11.560 --> 55:13.760
(WHIRRING)

55:51.760 --> 55:53.320
(LAUGHTER)

55:54.400 --> 55:56.800
That was exciting.

55:56.840 --> 55:58.280
I think...

55:59.600 --> 56:01.200
Who, here...

56:01.240 --> 56:03.880
Hands up. Who, here, would
like to have one of those

56:03.920 --> 56:06.000
-for going through
an airport?
-Yeah, it's the way forward.

56:06.040 --> 56:07.440
There you go.
We're onto something.

56:07.480 --> 56:09.240
-It's the way forwards.
-Just hang on a minute.

56:09.280 --> 56:11.600
Can I just ask, is that
the first race in history

56:11.640 --> 56:15.720
where all of the competitors
crashed before the finish?

56:15.760 --> 56:17.840
-(LAUGHTER)
-Probably is, actually.
-Um, probably, yeah.

56:17.880 --> 56:19.560
-Probably is. Yeah.
-And let's not forget

56:19.600 --> 56:20.960
when you used
your inventions,

56:21.000 --> 56:23.360
you fell off quite badly,

56:23.400 --> 56:26.760
you killed a man
and then you drove out of
the end of a tunnel.

56:26.800 --> 56:31.480
Yes, I did do that, and I
crashed into those Toblerone,
which also hurt, yeah.

56:31.520 --> 56:33.480
So those, those things
you've created

56:33.520 --> 56:36.520
are a complete menace
to the people using them,

56:36.560 --> 56:38.960
and everybody else
in the airport.

56:39.000 --> 56:40.240
-Uh...
-Fair?

56:40.280 --> 56:42.160
-Yeah.
-Yes, that is fair,

56:42.200 --> 56:44.200
actually,
now I come to think of it.

56:44.240 --> 56:47.160
And so, on that
terrible disappointment,
it's time to end.

56:47.200 --> 56:49.720
Now, next week,
there's a Grand Tour special.

56:49.760 --> 56:52.680
We're attempting to cross
the vast wilderness

56:52.720 --> 56:56.040
that is Mongolia,
using a car that we built -

56:56.080 --> 56:58.320
well, they built - ourselves.

56:58.360 --> 57:00.600
-(CHUCKLING)
-See you then. Take care.

57:00.640 --> 57:02.680
-Good night.
-(CHEERING)
