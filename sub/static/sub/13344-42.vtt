WEBVTT

00:05.739 --> 00:08.242
Man:
PREVIOUSLY ON
"IN TREATMENT"...

00:08.342 --> 00:11.579
AMY'S BEEN TRYING
TO REACH OUT TO ME
THIS WEEK

00:11.679 --> 00:14.448
AND MAKE IT ALL OKAY,
THE WHOLE BEN THING,

00:14.548 --> 00:16.584
BUT HOW CAN YOU MAKE UP
FOR SOMETHING LIKE THAT?

00:16.684 --> 00:20.321
I DON'T HAVE THAT MANY PEOPLE
TO TALK TO RIGHT NOW.

00:20.421 --> 00:23.691
I'M SCARED SHITLESS
OF LOSING LENNY IN SOME
CUSTODY BATTLE.

00:23.791 --> 00:27.061
AMY'S--
SHE'S DAMAGED, PAUL.

00:27.161 --> 00:29.263
SHE'S FUCKED UP.

00:29.363 --> 00:31.165
THE LAST TIME
YOU WERE HERE,

00:31.265 --> 00:34.468
YOU IMPLIED
THAT YOU HAD FALLEN
OUT OF LOVE WITH AMY.

00:34.568 --> 00:36.404
WOULD YOU STILL SAY
THAT'S TRUE?

00:36.504 --> 00:39.039
I DON'T KNOW.
HOW WOULD I KNOW?
WHAT DOES IT FEEL LIKE?

00:39.140 --> 00:41.909
I'VE ONLY EVER BEEN IN LOVE
WITH ONE GIRL-- HER.

00:42.009 --> 00:44.578
I'VE NEVER FALLEN OUT OF LOVE.
TELL ME WHAT IT FEELS LIKE

00:44.678 --> 00:47.115
AND I'LL TELL YOU
IF I'M FEELING IT.

00:52.120 --> 00:53.321
- HELLO, AMY.
- Jake: HEY, PAUL.

00:53.421 --> 00:55.656
HI, JAKE.
COME ON IN.

00:58.092 --> 01:00.394
- YOU'RE LOOKING WELL.
- THANK YOU.

01:05.599 --> 01:08.436
YOU KNOW, I'M ACTUALLY
GONNA MISS THIS OFFICE.

01:08.536 --> 01:12.106
I LIKE THE FEEL OF IT.
I LIKE THE CLUTTER.

01:12.206 --> 01:15.509
REALLY?
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
YOU'RE GONNA MISS IT?

01:18.379 --> 01:21.115
( sighs )
IT'S OUR LAST SESSION.

01:21.215 --> 01:24.118
WE'RE GETTING A DIVORCE--
FOR REAL THIS TIME.

01:26.887 --> 01:29.190
I AM SORRY TO HEAR THAT.

01:29.290 --> 01:31.058
Jake:
IT'S BECAUSE OF YOU,
ACTUALLY.

01:31.159 --> 01:33.627
WELL, NOT REALLY YOU.
IT'S BECAUSE OF THERAPY.

01:33.727 --> 01:35.796
THERAPY DID US GOOD.

01:37.565 --> 01:39.167
WOULD YOU AGREE
WITH THAT, AMY?

01:39.267 --> 01:42.570
SURE, IF BY "GOOD,"
HE MEANS, "IT WAS A DISASTER."

01:47.741 --> 01:50.110
( theme music playing )

02:07.395 --> 02:09.897
YOU EVER BEEN
THROUGH A DIVORCE, PAUL?

02:11.199 --> 02:12.099
NO, I HAVEN'T.

02:12.200 --> 02:13.667
IT'S NOT FOR SISSIES.

02:13.767 --> 02:15.869
EVEN WHEN YOU WANT IT
MORE THAN ANYTHING,

02:15.969 --> 02:20.274
IT TURNS INTO THIS SPIRAL
OF UNCERTAINTY AND PAIN

02:20.374 --> 02:22.576
AND YOU BURY
A PART OF YOURSELF.

02:27.815 --> 02:30.551
( clears throat )
WELL, MAYBE WE SHOULD BEGIN

02:30.651 --> 02:33.387
WITH JUST...

02:33.487 --> 02:38.259
RECAPPING THE LAST WEEK.
HOW'S IT BEEN?

02:38.359 --> 02:40.628
WELL, WE BARELY
SAW EACH OTHER ALL WEEK.

02:40.728 --> 02:44.598
THAT WAS JAKE'S IDEA.
HE WANTED TO SEE HOW
IT WOULD FEEL.

02:44.698 --> 02:45.766
AND?

02:46.734 --> 02:48.436
IT FELT OKAY.

02:49.403 --> 02:51.272
BETTER THAN I EXPECTED.

02:54.275 --> 02:56.244
- AMY?
- OH SURE.

02:56.344 --> 02:59.847
MY WEEK WAS
LIGHT AND BREEZY.

02:59.947 --> 03:01.982
WOULD YOU MIND
TALKING ABOUT IT?

03:02.082 --> 03:05.319
YES, I DO MIND TALKING
ABOUT IT BECAUSE EVERY TIME
I TELL YOU ABOUT MY WEEK,

03:05.419 --> 03:07.555
YOU FIND A WAY TO MAKE ME
FEEL MISERABLE,

03:07.655 --> 03:09.723
TO MAKE MY CHILDHOOD
SEEM LIKE A NIGHTMARE,

03:09.823 --> 03:13.394
TO MAKE MY MARRIAGE
LOOK LIKE A SHAM,
SO SORRY, FORGIVE ME,

03:13.494 --> 03:16.897
BUT I'M ACTUALLY THROUGH
TALKING ABOUT MY WEEK.

03:20.868 --> 03:23.537
- COME ON, THAT'S NOT
WHAT HAPPENED HERE.
- MAYBE NOT FOR YOU.

03:23.637 --> 03:27.107
WE CAME IN MISERABLE.
WE COULDN'T TALK
TO EACH OTHER.

03:27.207 --> 03:29.042
ALL WE COULD DO WAS FUCK.

03:29.142 --> 03:31.279
YOU KNOW?
FUCK AND FIGHT.

03:31.379 --> 03:34.147
TSCH.
AND NOW, I--

03:34.248 --> 03:36.884
I DON'T KNOW.
I'M FEELING...

03:36.984 --> 03:40.220
- WHAT?
- ...WHAT PAUL SAYS
HE'S SEEING--

03:40.321 --> 03:42.290
YOU KNOW, WHAT WE DO
TO EACH OTHER,

03:42.390 --> 03:44.625
HOW WE BRING OUT
THE WORST IN EACH OTHER.

03:44.725 --> 03:46.727
I CAN'T SPEAK
FOR YOU, BUT I--

03:46.827 --> 03:49.229
( sighs )

03:49.330 --> 03:52.099
I'M FEELING BETTER
THIS WEEK.

03:52.199 --> 03:53.867
BETTER THAN I'VE FELT
IN A LONG TIME.

03:53.967 --> 03:55.836
WHY CAN'T YOU
SPEAK FOR ME?

03:57.338 --> 03:59.807
UH... BECAUSE WE HAVEN'T
SEEN EACH OTHER ALL WEEK.

03:59.907 --> 04:01.575
WHOSE IDEA WAS THAT?

04:01.675 --> 04:03.911
- WELL, WE BOTH AGREED THAT--
- NO, I DIDN'T AGREE.

04:04.011 --> 04:06.280
Jake:
I THOUGHT YOU SAID
IT WAS A GOOD IDEA.

04:06.380 --> 04:08.248
I WAS TRYING TO BE
ACCOMMODATING.

04:08.349 --> 04:10.551
AND, WAIT, YOU CAN'T
SPEAK FOR ME?

04:10.651 --> 04:13.687
THERE WAS A TIME
WHEN YOU WOULD HAVE SPOKEN
FOR ME IN A HEARTBEAT,

04:13.787 --> 04:16.757
A TIME WHEN YOU KNEW
EVERY THOUGHT IN MY HEAD.

04:18.559 --> 04:21.194
I WANTED IT TO BE TRUE,
BUT IT NEVER WAS.

04:21.295 --> 04:23.564
AND HOW WOULD YOU KNOW THAT?
IT'S MY HEAD.

04:38.679 --> 04:40.981
DID YOU KNOW I HEARD
YOU PLAY THIS WEEK?

04:42.215 --> 04:43.651
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

04:43.751 --> 04:45.519
- WHERE?
- AT ELLIOT'S HOUSE
ON FRIDAY NIGHT.

04:45.619 --> 04:47.355
YOU WERE AT ELLIOT'S?
WHEN?

04:47.455 --> 04:49.690
WELL, NOT EXACTLY.
I WAS ON ELLIOT'S STREET.

04:49.790 --> 04:52.360
I COULD HEAR YOU PLAYING
FROM SITTING IN MY CAR.

04:52.460 --> 04:53.994
YOU WERE ACTUALLY
QUITE GOOD.

04:54.094 --> 04:56.129
Jake:
THAT'S INSANE.
THIS WAS FRIDAY NIGHT?

04:56.229 --> 04:58.332
- MM-HMM.
- WHERE WAS LENNY?

04:58.432 --> 05:00.868
HOME WITH A SITTER.
I WAS GONNA SURPRISE YOU.

05:00.968 --> 05:03.337
I WAS GONNA RING
THE DOORBELL AND COME INSIDE

05:03.437 --> 05:06.507
AND SAY-- ACTUALLY
I WAS HOPING I WOULDN'T
HAVE TO SAY ANYTHING.

05:06.607 --> 05:09.910
I WAS HOPING YOU'D
JUST GRAB ME BEFORE
I GOT TO THAT PART.

05:10.010 --> 05:12.546
- YOU NEVER CAME IN.
- NO.

05:13.514 --> 05:15.649
Jake:
WHY NOT?

05:15.749 --> 05:17.718
BECAUSE OF PAUL.

05:17.818 --> 05:20.688
BECAUSE OF EVERYTHING
THAT WE'VE SAID TO
EACH OTHER HERE.

05:20.788 --> 05:22.890
BECAUSE
I COULDN'T REMEMBER

05:22.990 --> 05:25.593
HOW WE USED TO MAKE UP
BEFORE WE CAME TO PAUL.

05:25.693 --> 05:28.396
WE USED TO HAVE SEX.
THAT'S HOW WE USED
TO MAKE UP.

05:28.496 --> 05:30.664
I'M SO SORRY I EVER
SUGGESTED COMING HERE.

05:30.764 --> 05:33.100
I JUST WISH
WE'D NEVER DONE IT.

05:35.903 --> 05:39.807
AMY, YOU SAID THAT
YOU SEE OUR WORK HERE
AS BEING A FAILURE.

05:39.907 --> 05:42.676
- WHY DO YOU THINK THAT?
- BECAUSE IT IS.

05:42.776 --> 05:44.545
BEEN COMING TO YOU
FOR MONTHS

05:44.645 --> 05:46.346
AND IT'S ONLY GOTTEN
WORSE BETWEEN US.

05:46.447 --> 05:50.150
JAKE, HOW DO YOU
SEE THE...

05:50.250 --> 05:51.885
THE THERAPY?
DO YOU SEE IT AS A SUCCESS?

05:51.985 --> 05:56.657
WELL, I THINK
IT'S A LITTLE BIT MORE
COMPLICATED THAN THAT.

05:56.757 --> 06:00.227
- IN WHAT WAY?
- I'M JUST--
I DON'T KNOW.

06:00.327 --> 06:02.295
I THINK I'M GETTING IT
MORE NOW--

06:02.396 --> 06:05.198
WHY WE CAN'T CONTROL
OUR DYNAMIC,

06:05.298 --> 06:07.300
WHY WE TRIGGER EACH OTHER'S
WORST INSTINCTS.

06:07.401 --> 06:11.204
AND, I DON'T KNOW,
IT FEELS GOOD TO ME.

06:11.304 --> 06:13.574
I MEAN, IT FEELS AWFUL,
OF COURSE,

06:13.674 --> 06:16.009
BUT IT FEELS GOOD
THAT IT'S MAKING MORE SENSE.

06:16.109 --> 06:18.612
YOU KNOW?
LIKE, IT'S NOT ME,
IT'S NOT HER, IT'S US.

06:18.712 --> 06:20.581
IT SEEMS TO ME
THAT IT'S FINALLY CLEAR

06:20.681 --> 06:22.716
THAT YOU BOTH HAVE TWO
RADICALLY DIFFERENT IDEAS

06:22.816 --> 06:25.052
OF WHAT A RELATIONSHIP
FUNDAMENTALLY IS.

06:25.152 --> 06:28.456
AMY, YOU THINK THINGS ARE
FALLING APART, YET THE WORST
IS GONNA COME.

06:28.556 --> 06:30.691
JAKE, YOU SEE THINGS
AS COMING TOGETHER,

06:30.791 --> 06:34.462
THAT THE FUTURE IS
BRIGHTER THAN THE PAST.

06:34.562 --> 06:36.830
YOU'RE EVALUATING
OUR ENTIRE BEINGS

06:36.930 --> 06:39.933
BASED ON THE WAY THAT
WE BEHAVE AT THE MOMENT
WE'RE GETTING DIVORCED?

06:40.033 --> 06:43.236
- THAT'S RIDICULOUS.
- THERE IS A THEORY

06:43.336 --> 06:45.305
THAT SAYS THE WAY
A PERSON HANDLES ONE THING

06:45.405 --> 06:47.575
IS THE WAY
THEY HANDLE EVERYTHING.

06:47.675 --> 06:52.245
AND... I GUESS
WHAT I'M TRYING TO DO
IS TAKE INTO ACCOUNT

06:52.345 --> 06:55.649
THE WHOLE HISTORY
OF YOUR RELATIONSHIP.

06:55.749 --> 06:58.185
I DO REMEMBER, AMY,
THAT IT WAS SEX

06:58.285 --> 07:00.287
THAT FIRST ATTRACTED YOU
TO EACH OTHER.

07:00.387 --> 07:02.823
AND YOUR FIRST ENCOUNTERS
YOU DESCRIBED

07:02.923 --> 07:05.659
AS "MESSY, BUT REALLY
REALLY POWERFUL."

07:05.759 --> 07:08.195
AND THEN YOU GOT PREGNANT,
WHICH YOU HADN'T PLANNED,

07:08.295 --> 07:10.464
AND THEN YOU GOT MARRIED.

07:10.564 --> 07:13.166
BY THEN YOU'D BEGUN
TO FALL INTO THE PATTERNS

07:13.266 --> 07:15.536
OF PROVOKING EACH OTHER.

07:18.071 --> 07:22.209
AMY, YOU MENTIONED
HOW DEPRESSED YOU WERE
WHEN LENNY WAS BORN.

07:22.309 --> 07:24.011
DO YOU REMEMBER THAT?

07:25.212 --> 07:26.947
DO YOU REMEMBER WHY?

07:29.617 --> 07:33.353
I FELT LIKE THE WORLD
WAS A TERRIBLE PLACE

07:33.453 --> 07:35.923
AND IT WAS WRONG
TO BRING A CHILD INTO IT.

07:37.658 --> 07:39.493
AND WHAT ABOUT YOU, JAKE?

07:39.593 --> 07:41.995
WHAT DO YOU REMEMBER FEELING
WHEN LENNY WAS BORN?

07:42.095 --> 07:45.465
I FELT PURE...

07:46.366 --> 07:48.536
UNADULTERATED ELATION.

07:49.770 --> 07:51.839
LOOK, I STILL
DON'T UNDERSTAND.

07:51.939 --> 07:54.708
I'M A PESSIMIST
AND HE'S AN OPTIMIST

07:54.808 --> 07:56.844
AND OPPOSITES ATTRACT.

07:56.944 --> 07:59.680
THAT HAPPENS ALL THE TIME,
SO WHY CAN'T WE FIX THIS?

07:59.780 --> 08:01.782
WHY DOESN'T
THIS RELATIONSHIP WORK?

08:01.882 --> 08:05.553
YOU KNOW, I THINK THAT
WHAT WE'VE TRIED TO DO
HERE IN THESE SESSIONS

08:05.653 --> 08:08.922
IS TO ILLUMINATE
THE PATTERNS OF BEHAVIOR

08:09.022 --> 08:11.391
THAT HAVE KEPT
THE TWO OF YOU KIND OF...

08:11.491 --> 08:14.662
( sighs )
COILED AROUND EACH OTHER--

08:14.762 --> 08:18.566
THE CYCLES
THAT YOU'VE EMBRACED,

08:18.666 --> 08:21.201
THE WAY YOU'VE
HIDDEN BEHIND THEM.

08:21.301 --> 08:23.704
SO YOU CAN'T REALLY

08:23.804 --> 08:26.039
ACT OUT THESE
PATTERNS ANYMORE

08:26.139 --> 08:28.241
BECAUSE EVERYTHING
IS NOW OUT IN THE OPEN.

08:28.341 --> 08:30.210
NOW THEY'RE
IN THE CONSCIOUS MIND.

08:30.310 --> 08:32.012
THE TWO OF YOU ARE,
IN A WAY,

08:32.112 --> 08:34.748
EMOTIONALLY NAKED
BEFORE EACH OTHER.

08:42.422 --> 08:44.592
I REMEMBER
WHEN IT ALL STARTED.

08:45.893 --> 08:48.829
AFTER LENNY WAS BORN,
I JUST SORT OF LOST IT.

08:48.929 --> 08:51.364
THERE WERE NIGHTS
I'D SIT THERE HOLDING HIM

08:51.464 --> 08:53.000
WATCHING TELEVISION,
JUST CRYING.

08:53.100 --> 08:55.468
AND THEN OF COURSE,
HE'D START TO CRY.

08:55.569 --> 08:57.705
JAKE WOULD COME HOME
FROM WORK AND TAKE LENNY

08:57.805 --> 08:59.707
AND TAKE HIM
INTO ANOTHER ROOM.

08:59.807 --> 09:01.742
I MEAN, I CAME OUT OF IT
EVENTUALLY,

09:01.842 --> 09:05.178
BUT JAKE DIDN'T LOOK AT ME
THE SAME WAY AGAIN.

09:05.278 --> 09:07.681
- THAT'S NOT EXACTLY
WHAT HAPPENED.
- YES, IT IS.

09:07.781 --> 09:11.018
WHEN I GOT DEPRESSED,
IT WAS LIKE YOU TOOK IT
PERSONALLY OR SOMETHING.

09:11.118 --> 09:13.954
- YOU ACTED AS IF
I'D BETRAYED YOU.
- YOU HAD.

09:19.059 --> 09:21.294
WHEN I MET YOU,
YOU SEEMED LIKE
THIS PERSON

09:21.394 --> 09:23.764
WHO WAS UNHAPPY
IN A RELATIONSHIP.

09:23.864 --> 09:26.734
SO I THOUGHT,
"TAKE THE WOMAN OUT
OF THE RELATIONSHIP

09:26.834 --> 09:28.702
AND YOU'LL TAKE AWAY
HER PAIN."

09:28.802 --> 09:31.772
BUT THEN I GOT YOU OUT
OF THE RELATIONSHIP AND YOU
WERE STILL UNHAPPY.

09:31.872 --> 09:34.307
AND THEN WE HAD A KID,
A BEAUTIFUL KID,

09:34.407 --> 09:36.977
AND YOU WERE STILL UNHAPPY,

09:37.077 --> 09:39.179
SO I FELT LIKE
I'D BEEN TRICKED.

09:49.422 --> 09:51.324
( softly )
SORRY.

09:51.424 --> 09:53.661
I WASN'T TRYING
TO TRICK YOU.

09:57.530 --> 10:00.768
- I'M SORRY TOO.
- YOU DON'T HAVE ANYTHING
TO BE SORRY ABOUT.

10:00.868 --> 10:02.870
NO, I DO.
I'M SORRY.

10:05.839 --> 10:07.808
I REALLY HAVE SCREWED
A LOT OF THINGS UP

10:07.908 --> 10:09.209
AND...

10:10.878 --> 10:13.046
I'M REALLY SORRY THAT I...

10:16.249 --> 10:17.818
GOT ANGRY.

10:20.821 --> 10:22.022
I KNEW YOU WERE HAVING
A HARD TIME

10:22.122 --> 10:24.024
AND I SHOULDN'T HAVE
DONE THAT.

10:35.268 --> 10:36.904
I DON'T KNOW.
I JUST...

10:40.007 --> 10:43.176
- I GOT SCARED.
- WE BOTH DID.

10:47.981 --> 10:50.383
I'M GONNA MISS
OUR FAMILY.

11:00.828 --> 11:02.730
THIS IS WHAT I SEE
IN FRONT OF ME:

11:02.830 --> 11:05.232
TWO PEOPLE WHO HAVE REALLY
LOVED EACH OTHER DEEPLY.

11:05.332 --> 11:08.836
AND EVEN THOUGH YOU'RE
NOT BRINGING EACH OTHER
HAPPINESS AT THE MOMENT,

11:08.936 --> 11:13.173
THE TRUTH IS YOU'VE GOTTEN
TO THIS PLACE TOGETHER.

11:13.273 --> 11:16.910
AND THOUGH YOU'RE LOOKING
AT IT FROM DIFFERENT
PERSPECTIVES,

11:17.010 --> 11:20.480
IT IS THE SAME PLACE.

11:20.580 --> 11:24.517
AND I GUESS WHAT
I'M ASKING YOU TO DO

11:24.617 --> 11:27.721
IS TO THINK ABOUT
NOT TURNING AWAY.

11:27.821 --> 11:29.389
EVEN AT THIS
DIFFICULT TIME

11:29.489 --> 11:32.092
WHEN YOU'RE CONTEMPLATING
THE NOTION OF SEPARATION,

11:32.192 --> 11:36.696
YOU CAN STILL DRAW STRENGTH
FROM EACH OTHER.

11:39.199 --> 11:41.769
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?
YOU THINK WE SHOULDN'T
GET DIVORCED?

11:41.869 --> 11:43.837
COUPLES THERAPY EITHER
HELPS PEOPLE HEAL

11:43.937 --> 11:47.140
OR IT SHOWS THEM
HOW THEY CAN SEPARATE.

11:47.240 --> 11:49.709
THE THERAPIST'S JOB
IN THE END,

11:49.810 --> 11:53.146
I SUPPOSE, IS TO LET
THE COUPLE DECIDE.

11:53.246 --> 11:55.382
BUT WE'VE BEEN
COMING HERE FOR WEEKS.

11:55.482 --> 11:59.052
WE'VE TOLD YOU SO MUCH.
YOU MUST HAVE AN OPINION.

11:59.152 --> 12:03.090
ALL I CAN SAY IS THAT YOU
ARE A UNIQUE COUPLE.

12:03.190 --> 12:05.793
I KNOW COUPLES
WHO USE LESS ENERGY
TO MAKE LOVE

12:05.893 --> 12:08.796
THAN YOU TWO USE
IN CASUAL CONVERSATION.

12:08.896 --> 12:11.832
AND PASSION LIKE THAT
IS A RARE COMMODITY.

12:11.932 --> 12:14.034
BUT PASSION ITSELF
ISN'T ENOUGH

12:14.134 --> 12:16.937
TO SUSTAIN A RELATIONSHIP
FOR A LIFETIME.

12:17.037 --> 12:18.605
WHAT IS?

12:18.705 --> 12:23.777
WHAT IS ENOUGH
TO KEEP TWO PEOPLE
TOGETHER FOR A LIFETIME?

12:23.877 --> 12:26.246
I WISH I KNEW
THE ANSWER TO THAT.

12:36.056 --> 12:38.291
I'M SO WORRIED
ABOUT LENNY.

12:39.893 --> 12:42.429
YEAH, HE'S GONNA HAVE
A WHOLE DIFFERENT LIFE.

12:44.965 --> 12:47.200
SO YOU'RE GONNA
SHARE CUSTODY THEN.

12:48.768 --> 12:50.770
I ASSUME WE WOULD.

12:52.139 --> 12:53.506
JAKE?

12:55.909 --> 12:58.378
YEAH.
JOINT CUSTODY.

13:03.951 --> 13:05.986
YOU UNDERSTAND
WHAT THAT MEANS.

13:06.086 --> 13:08.088
IT MEANS HE MOVES
BACK AND FORTH, RIGHT?

13:08.188 --> 13:10.523
YES, BUT I THINK
IT'S A LITTLE BIT MORE
SPECIFIC THAN THAT.

13:10.623 --> 13:13.693
BUT, YOU KNOW WHAT?
THIS ISN'T MY AREA
OF EXPERTISE.

13:13.793 --> 13:15.896
YOU BOTH NEED
TO SIT DOWN

13:15.996 --> 13:18.231
AND DISCUSS THIS
IN DETAIL

13:18.331 --> 13:20.367
WITH A LAWYER.

13:22.735 --> 13:24.037
JESUS.

13:24.137 --> 13:26.773
WE CAN BARELY GET HIM
TO SCHOOL ON TIME
AS IT IS

13:26.874 --> 13:28.541
BETWEEN THE TWO OF US.

13:28.641 --> 13:30.277
AMY'S WORKING AS MUCH
AS SHE DOES...

13:30.377 --> 13:33.947
SO I GUESS, WHAT?
I SHOULD TAKE HIM
DURING THE WEEK?

13:34.047 --> 13:36.950
ACTUALLY, I'M NOT
WORKING ANYMORE.

13:38.751 --> 13:40.520
WHAT, DID YOU QUIT?

13:44.324 --> 13:45.392
WHAT HAPPENED?

13:45.492 --> 13:47.694
I SLEPT WITH MY BOSS.
AND HE HAS A WIFE.

13:47.794 --> 13:49.229
HE DIDN'T WANT ME
AROUND ANYMORE.

13:49.329 --> 13:53.433
- SO YOU WERE FIRED.
- YEAH.

13:54.567 --> 13:56.569
THAT FUCKING ASSHOLE.

14:00.507 --> 14:02.209
I'M RELIEVED, ACTUALLY.

14:02.309 --> 14:05.345
WE'VE GOT A BIT OF A CUSHION
WITH THE SEVERANCE PACKAGE,

14:05.445 --> 14:06.546
SO...

14:11.451 --> 14:13.987
I GOT A PRODUCER WHO'S STILL
REALLY INTERESTED

14:14.087 --> 14:16.056
IN A FEW SONGS OF MINE.

14:17.991 --> 14:20.227
I THINK IT MIGHT BE HELPFUL
TO TALK THROUGH

14:20.327 --> 14:22.029
SOME OF THE MORE
COMPLICATED QUESTIONS

14:22.129 --> 14:23.964
THAT ARISE AS A RESULT.

14:24.064 --> 14:27.600
FOR EXAMPLE, JAKE,
HAVE YOU THOUGHT ABOUT
WHERE YOU'RE GOING TO LIVE?

14:27.700 --> 14:31.304
WELL, I WAS THINKING
OF GETTING A PLACE
IN THE CITY.

14:31.404 --> 14:34.174
I KNOW A GUY,
HE'S A FRIEND OF ELLIOT'S.
HE'S GOT THIS LOFT.

14:34.274 --> 14:36.343
IT'S ROUGH,
BUT IT'S CHEAP.

14:36.443 --> 14:40.013
THERE'S ENOUGH SPACE
FOR ME, LENNY, AND MAYBE EVEN
A LITTLE RECORDING STUDIO.

14:40.113 --> 14:41.714
- IS IT SAFE?
- SURE.

14:41.814 --> 14:44.117
- IS THERE A DOORMAN?
- I JUST TOLD YOU
IT WAS CHEAP.

14:44.217 --> 14:46.719
I DON'T WANT LENNY
STAYING IN SOMEPLACE
THAT ISN'T SAFE.

14:46.819 --> 14:49.322
WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO,
STAY IN THE HOUSE WITH YOU,

14:49.422 --> 14:51.558
BUILD A LITTLE WALL
THROUGH THE BEDROOM?

14:54.261 --> 14:57.064
I THOUGHT ABOUT MOVING AWAY,
STARTING OVER IN ANOTHER PLACE,

14:57.164 --> 14:59.066
BUT I WANT HIM
TO BE CLOSE TO YOU.

14:59.166 --> 15:00.633
LOOK, IT'LL BE FINE.

15:00.733 --> 15:03.070
IT'LL BE GOOD FOR HIM TO GET
OUT OF THE SUBURBS ANYWAY.

15:03.170 --> 15:05.738
AND YOU KNOW I'M NOT
GONNA LET ANYTHING BAD
HAPPEN TO HIM.

15:05.838 --> 15:07.607
IF WORSE COMES TO WORSE,
YOU COULD ALWAYS

15:07.707 --> 15:10.110
- GET YOUR PARENTS
TO HELP OUT WITH LENNY.
- ARE YOU KIDDING?

15:10.210 --> 15:13.313
I'D LIVE ON THE STREETS
BEFORE I EVER ASK MY
PARENTS FOR HELP.

15:17.484 --> 15:20.820
HAVE YOU TOLD THEM
ABOUT THIS, ABOUT US?

15:20.920 --> 15:22.622
- YEAH.
- WHAT'D THEY SAY?

15:22.722 --> 15:24.424
MY DAD CRIED.

15:24.524 --> 15:26.259
- REALLY?
- NO.

15:26.359 --> 15:29.296
BUT I THINK HE WANTED TO.
I COULD TELL.

15:29.396 --> 15:33.066
HELL, PROBABLY
INVITE YOU FOR CHRISTMAS,
TELL YOU TO BRING A DATE.

15:35.302 --> 15:37.004
WE'LL FIGURE
THIS CUSTODY THING OUT.

15:37.104 --> 15:39.072
PEOPLE DO IT
EVERY YEAR, RIGHT?

15:51.418 --> 15:53.386
HAVE EITHER OF YOU
TALKED TO LENNY

15:53.486 --> 15:55.655
ABOUT WHAT'S BEEN
GOING ON BETWEEN YOU?

15:55.755 --> 15:58.058
NOT REALLY,
BUT HE KNOWS.

15:58.158 --> 16:00.727
KIDS PICK UP
ON EVERYTHING,
YOU KNOW?

16:00.827 --> 16:02.262
THEY CERTAINLY DO.

16:02.362 --> 16:04.731
HE THINKS WE'RE CRAZY.
I CAN TELL.

16:04.831 --> 16:08.068
HE'S ONLY NINE.
BUT HE ALREADY REALIZES
HE'S GOT CRAZY PARENTS.

16:08.168 --> 16:09.902
HE'S NOT ENTIRELY
WRONG THERE, IS HE?

16:10.003 --> 16:11.771
( snorts )

16:11.871 --> 16:14.841
REMEMBER THAT TIME
WE TRIED TO TEACH HIM
WHERE BABIES COME FROM?

16:14.941 --> 16:17.044
( chuckles )

16:17.144 --> 16:20.647
PAUL, AMY HAD GOTTEN HIM
THIS BOOK CALLED

16:20.747 --> 16:22.382
"WHERE DO I COME FROM?"

16:22.482 --> 16:24.451
IT WAS ONE OF THOSE
CARTOON BOOKS

16:24.551 --> 16:26.686
THAT THEY WRITE
TO TEACH KIDS ABOUT SEX.

16:26.786 --> 16:28.588
IT WAS A PRETTY GOOD BOOK,

16:28.688 --> 16:31.224
- EXCEPT--
- EXCEPT THAT IT LEFT OUT
THIS REALLY SIGNIFICANT PART,

16:31.324 --> 16:34.894
- THAT SEX IS PLEASURABLE.
- WHICH AMY FELT LIKE LENNY
REALLY NEEDED TO KNOW.

16:34.994 --> 16:38.298
THEY MADE IT SOUND LIKE
SEX WAS SOMETHING GROWN-UPS
DID BECAUSE THEY HAD TO,

16:38.398 --> 16:40.767
- LIKE BRUSHING YOUR TEETH.
- I'M READING LENNY THE BOOK

16:40.867 --> 16:43.603
AND AMY KEEPS INTERRUPTING
TRYING TO EXPLAIN TO HIM
WHAT SEX FEELS LIKE

16:43.703 --> 16:46.839
USING ALL THESE RIDICULOUS
METAPHORS TO DESCRIBE HOW SEX
FEELS FOR A WOMAN.

16:46.939 --> 16:48.708
IT WAS MY ONLY
FRAME OF REFERENCE.

16:48.808 --> 16:50.443
MEANWHILE,
JAKE KEEPS CORRECTING ME

16:50.543 --> 16:53.246
WITH THESE CONTRADICTORY
METAPHORS FROM THE MALE
PERSPECTIVE,

16:53.346 --> 16:56.483
SAYING IT'S LIKE
HITTING A HOME RUN NAKED
INSIDE OF SOMEONE ELSE.

16:56.583 --> 16:59.719
AND THIS POOR KID
IS JUST LOOKING AT US,
JUST MORE AND MORE CONFUSED

16:59.819 --> 17:02.355
- UNTIL FINALLY HE JUST--
- GOT UP AND WALKED AWAY.

17:02.455 --> 17:04.191
JUST WALKED
RIGHT OUT THE DOOR.

17:04.291 --> 17:05.792
SHAKING HIS HEAD
LIKE A LITTLE OLD MAN.

17:05.892 --> 17:07.360
( chuckles )

17:20.440 --> 17:21.774
YEAH.

17:22.842 --> 17:24.611
YEAH, HE'LL BE OKAY.

17:47.767 --> 17:50.303
MY FATHER USED TO SAY
THERE'S NO GREATER DISTANCE

17:50.403 --> 17:53.206
THAN THE SPACE
BETWEEN TWO HEADS.

17:59.579 --> 18:03.450
( sobs )
WE'RE OVER, AREN'T WE?

18:05.585 --> 18:07.687
( gasping )

18:08.755 --> 18:10.323
( sobbing )

18:26.105 --> 18:27.474
DAMN IT.

18:28.608 --> 18:30.743
( sobbing )

18:34.214 --> 18:36.416
OH GOD!

19:09.782 --> 19:11.618
WE SHOULD GET GOING.

19:11.718 --> 19:14.454
LENNY'S PIANO LESSON IS
GONNA BE OVER PRETTY SOON.

19:19.025 --> 19:20.727
( breathlessly )
SORRY.

19:23.663 --> 19:25.665
AND I NEED TO GO.
I DON'T THINK I CAN
BE HERE ANY LONGER.

19:25.765 --> 19:28.201
- WE'RE GONNA
TALK TO HIM NOW?!
- NO, I THINK LATER.

19:28.301 --> 19:30.603
- WHEN?
- I DON'T KNOW, OKAY?

19:30.703 --> 19:33.840
I THINK YOU'LL FIND
THE RIGHT TIME.

19:33.940 --> 19:35.908
WE'RE GONNA BE LATE.
LET'S GO.

19:37.777 --> 19:40.213
DO YOU WANT TO STAY AND TALK
TO PAUL FOR A FEW MORE MINUTES

19:40.313 --> 19:41.681
AND I CAN GO PICK
LENNY UP MYSELF?

19:41.781 --> 19:43.950
NO, I WANT THIS
TO BE HARDER FOR YOU.

19:45.252 --> 19:46.953
- IT IS HARD FOR ME.
- NO, IT'S NOT.

19:47.053 --> 19:49.222
YOU CAN'T WAIT
TO GET OUT OF HERE.

19:50.990 --> 19:52.459
NO, I'M JUST DONE
WITH THIS ROOM.

19:52.559 --> 19:55.462
OKAY, I WANT TO GO
TO A BAR, GET DRUNK,

19:55.562 --> 19:58.565
AND CRY LIKE A BABY.
I WANT TO FEEL ALL
THOSE THINGS.

19:58.665 --> 20:01.368
I JUST DON'T WANT
TO DO IT HERE, OKAY?

20:10.677 --> 20:12.211
COME ON, AME.

20:15.815 --> 20:17.284
( gate opens )

20:20.287 --> 20:21.721
WHO'S THAT?

20:24.924 --> 20:26.893
MY NEXT PATIENTS.

20:44.076 --> 20:45.745
( sighs )

20:52.184 --> 20:53.720
( Jake whispers )
LET'S GO.

21:01.994 --> 21:05.365
Paul:
AMY. JAKE.

21:20.279 --> 21:23.316
( s playing )music
