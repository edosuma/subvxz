01:55.988 --> 01:58.194
Giddy-up! We're almost home.

01:58.324 --> 01:59.948
<i>(laughs)</i>

02:27.895 --> 02:29.473
<i>(screams)</i>

02:38.489 --> 02:40.861
All right. Tomatoes.

02:43.786 --> 02:46.989
There you go. OK, boys.

02:47.123 --> 02:48.665
Pull!

02:51.210 --> 02:53.879
- <i>(boys laugh)</i>
- How's that?

02:55.131 --> 02:57.170
Try some tomatoes.

03:01.262 --> 03:04.216
Here we go. Ready?

03:06.600 --> 03:10.100
Got 'em! Pretty good, huh? Thanks, guys.

03:12.064 --> 03:14.140
<i>(horse and cart approaches)</i>

03:14.275 --> 03:15.769
Uh-oh.

03:15.901 --> 03:18.357
Man your battle stations, boys.

03:33.002 --> 03:35.753
- <i>(laughs)</i>
- Whoa!

03:35.880 --> 03:37.919
Welcome home.

03:40.384 --> 03:42.424
- I got it! I got it!
- What did you get?

03:42.553 --> 03:46.551
- Come on, I'll show you. Come on.
- Well, let's go then.

03:48.642 --> 03:52.640
So what's the occasion?
Come on. Let me see. Let me see!

03:54.440 --> 03:56.895
Come on, open it.

03:57.026 --> 03:59.564
God, you're gonna love this.

04:00.237 --> 04:02.313
Oh, I hope you like it.

04:06.577 --> 04:09.448
- It's a suit.
- Right, a suit.

04:10.790 --> 04:13.993
- You hate it, don't you?
- No, but I could learn to.

04:14.126 --> 04:17.744
You could learn to like it too.
You can't dress like that in America.

04:17.880 --> 04:20.418
Another good reason
not to go to America. Huh?

04:20.548 --> 04:23.420
You're not suckering me
into that argument again.

04:23.552 --> 04:27.550
I'm not getting married here and spending
my honeymoon swinging from vines

04:27.681 --> 04:30.848
and checking the bed for snakes.

04:30.976 --> 04:34.345
Those weren't the only things
I had planned.

04:59.338 --> 05:00.963
<i>(gasps)</i>

05:06.011 --> 05:07.636
Jesse.

05:13.185 --> 05:15.972
- Come on out and show us.
- Not on your life.

05:16.105 --> 05:20.103
Which, by the way,
this suit has put in serious jeopardy.

05:26.448 --> 05:28.821
- You look great.
- I look ridiculous.

05:28.951 --> 05:32.154
I can't breathe. This thing is dangerous.

05:34.290 --> 05:36.959
Come on. Come on.

05:43.549 --> 05:47.167
Ask them how you look. They'll be honest.

05:47.303 --> 05:50.588
- OK, boys. How do I look?
- <i>(boys squeal)</i>

05:50.723 --> 05:53.973
That's it. That clinches it.

05:54.101 --> 05:56.141
- Dumont!
- <i>(groans)</i>

05:57.855 --> 06:00.524
- Dumont!
- Agon.

06:00.649 --> 06:03.769
- They follow... Quatermain.
- Don't try to talk.

06:03.903 --> 06:07.236
- I'm here. We'll take care of you.
- <i>(screams)</i>

06:08.491 --> 06:10.400
Damn!

06:11.035 --> 06:13.526
- Get him in the house.
- Quatermain!

06:15.956 --> 06:18.282
Quatermain, no!

06:44.527 --> 06:45.902
<i>(rustling)</i>

06:46.028 --> 06:47.439
<i>(growls)</i>

06:51.325 --> 06:52.819
<i>(growls)</i>

07:21.105 --> 07:22.184
<i>(screams)</i>

07:49.300 --> 07:53.428
Quatermain.
Quatermain, are you hurt? Are?

07:53.554 --> 07:55.593
Your suit.

07:55.723 --> 07:57.762
I'm fine, thanks.

07:59.602 --> 08:01.594
<i>(heavy breathing)</i>

08:18.245 --> 08:20.736
Quatermain, is that you?

08:21.415 --> 08:23.574
I'm right here. Right here.

08:23.709 --> 08:26.200
Incredible, Q.

08:26.337 --> 08:29.457
I had to get out. Incredible.

08:30.674 --> 08:32.714
Gold.

08:32.842 --> 08:35.465
Streets of it.

08:35.596 --> 08:38.134
Swarma. He's...

08:38.265 --> 08:40.886
See Swarma. He...

08:41.477 --> 08:43.515
See Swarma.

08:48.275 --> 08:51.691
I wanna know if my brother is still alive.

08:51.821 --> 08:54.109
Robeson. He's...

08:54.240 --> 08:56.398
Robeson.

08:56.534 --> 08:59.321
- Please, try!
- Not our fault.

08:59.453 --> 09:02.490
Didn't know. Didn't know.

09:02.623 --> 09:05.244
Don't want to die.

09:05.376 --> 09:07.783
No! No!

09:07.920 --> 09:09.663
<i>(whimpers)</i>

09:10.214 --> 09:11.838
No!

09:14.718 --> 09:17.388
Come on. Just let him be now.

09:36.365 --> 09:38.405
He's asleep now.

09:40.828 --> 09:46.866
I'm sure after he gets some rest he'll
be able to tell you about your brother.

09:47.001 --> 09:52.754
Those men he was muttering about -
Hudson and Tremont. Who are they?

09:52.882 --> 09:57.757
Old friends. They thought about adventure
first and the danger second.

09:57.887 --> 10:01.931
Always ready to go out
at the drop of a legend.

10:02.057 --> 10:05.177
They left while we were
at King Solomon's Mines.

10:05.311 --> 10:11.396
They were searching for a great lost city,
a lost white race.

10:11.525 --> 10:14.479
My brother pestered me about it for years.

10:14.612 --> 10:16.818
It was a crazy idea and I told him.

10:16.947 --> 10:21.693
Too damn dangerous chasing after
just another improbable African myth.

10:21.827 --> 10:27.034
- I guess he got tired of pestering me.
- Do you think he found it?

10:27.750 --> 10:30.870
They found something,
or something found them.

10:31.003 --> 10:33.624
You're the resident archaeologist.

10:33.756 --> 10:36.425
What do you make of this?

10:37.593 --> 10:39.217
It's gold.

10:41.096 --> 10:43.136
Possibly commemorative.

10:47.311 --> 10:52.898
The inscription here,
it looks Phoenician, or a variation.

10:53.025 --> 10:54.899
Phoenician?

10:55.027 --> 10:58.941
I've never seen anything quite like it.
Where'd you get it?

10:59.073 --> 11:02.738
It was in Dumont's things. And this knife.

11:04.620 --> 11:07.537
What do you think?

11:08.332 --> 11:10.372
Very strange.

11:12.503 --> 11:15.124
The sun symbol is definitely Egyptian.

11:19.969 --> 11:22.257
But the graphics are Phoenician.

11:24.932 --> 11:27.684
And the detail is very advanced.

11:31.063 --> 11:33.103
It just doesn't make any sense.

11:33.232 --> 11:37.360
The man who attacked me wore a band
with this symbol on it.

11:39.196 --> 11:41.236
They found something.

11:47.913 --> 11:49.538
<i>(footsteps)</i>

12:35.753 --> 12:37.627
<i>(screams)</i>

12:38.797 --> 12:40.624
<i>(screams)</i>

12:46.680 --> 12:49.847
Oh, the devil! The devil's been here!

12:54.188 --> 12:57.473
One thing's for sure -
the fever didn't kill him.

13:09.078 --> 13:11.035
Quatermain! Hey, Quatermain!

13:11.163 --> 13:14.698
- Not today, trader.
- Some fine pots, Quatermain.

13:14.833 --> 13:17.503
You can never have enough fine pots.

13:18.379 --> 13:21.712
- I don't think so.
- Oh, please, Quatermain.

13:23.425 --> 13:26.841
- Come on. Business can't be that bad.
- <i>(screams)</i>

13:27.846 --> 13:29.257
Trader.

13:29.390 --> 13:32.723
Trader, I'll, uh... I'll buy it.
I'll buy the pot.

13:32.852 --> 13:34.891
- Trader.
- <i>(laughs)</i>

13:37.064 --> 13:39.389
What a wonderful fabric, eh, Quatermain?

13:39.525 --> 13:43.392
Woven by the finest English craftsmen.
It fits like skin.

13:43.529 --> 13:45.984
Not a nice trick, trader.
Where'd you get it?

13:46.115 --> 13:50.576
From some Lamu tribesmen who,
as you know, are most fond of beheading.

13:50.703 --> 13:54.368
I fear the men who wore them
were not so well-served by the shirts.

13:54.498 --> 13:57.369
A costly oversight by the tailor.

14:00.296 --> 14:04.044
Wait, Quatermain. You must buy
the shirt. It will save your life.

14:04.175 --> 14:08.967
Four of them, Quatermain,
for five kilos of ham and four hides.

14:09.096 --> 14:13.343
- Simply avoid the Lamu.
- I'll buy the shirt if I get some information.

14:13.475 --> 14:16.476
- I'm looking for a man called Swarma.
- Ah, Swarma.

14:16.604 --> 14:20.553
Knows all, sees all,
tells all - for a price.

14:21.358 --> 14:25.985
Perhaps he's in there
on such a hot and dusty day. <i>(Laughs)</i>

14:43.839 --> 14:45.915
<i>(hums)</i>

14:46.050 --> 14:47.877
<i>(knocking at door)</i>

14:58.103 --> 15:02.896
- I have no need of your goods.
- But you have need for my information.

15:03.025 --> 15:05.065
Quatermain comes looking for you.

15:05.194 --> 15:09.144
About a man who died, and a coin.
If you wish to know more...

15:09.281 --> 15:11.903
One of my followers
has brought me this news.

15:12.034 --> 15:14.442
What can I say? It's a small town.

15:14.578 --> 15:17.034
Possibly you have more details.

15:17.164 --> 15:22.122
A friend of Quatermain stumbled into
his yard with tales of a lost city of gold.

15:22.253 --> 15:25.586
He uttered your name before he died,
killed in his bed.

15:27.883 --> 15:30.255
- Quick.
- But my pay?

15:30.386 --> 15:33.422
Yes, yes, here. Hurry, hurry, hurry.

15:33.556 --> 15:35.382
Swarma.

15:43.065 --> 15:45.521
Come in. Come in, sir.

15:50.990 --> 15:54.738
Have you ever seen one of these before?

15:58.247 --> 16:00.323
It is a coin.

16:01.041 --> 16:03.532
Very good.

16:03.669 --> 16:07.501
A coin of gold.
I told your brother of such a coin, sir.

16:08.132 --> 16:13.008
It belonged to Reverend Mackenzie and
has a history that we can only dream of.

16:13.137 --> 16:16.588
- How did Mackenzie get it?
- Three years ago, sir,

16:16.724 --> 16:21.433
a man fell in his doorway
with great fever and many itches.

16:21.562 --> 16:23.804
He had such a coin,

16:23.939 --> 16:30.227
and he spoke of a city far beyond
Lekanisera, lost in the mountains,

16:32.072 --> 16:35.773
with streets and roofs of gold,

16:35.910 --> 16:40.287
ruled by a lost white race.
Fever talk, perhaps.

16:40.414 --> 16:44.115
- Then my friend had the same fever.
- He saw these streets of gold?

16:44.251 --> 16:47.786
So he said. Did you tell my brother
how to find this lost city?

16:47.922 --> 16:51.540
I told him what I knew.
Find the wall of Jalpora.

16:51.675 --> 16:55.720
Pay heed to its secrets.
Seek the Devil's Heart.

16:55.846 --> 16:58.302
Watch for signs.

16:58.432 --> 17:02.809
- Sounds like helpful travel tips.
- Will you too search for this city of gold?

17:02.937 --> 17:08.560
I'll search for my family and friends.
This lost civilisation can keep its gold.

17:18.911 --> 17:20.951
Kiba, catch.

17:26.585 --> 17:27.829
Hi.

17:33.926 --> 17:39.086
You had better hurry because we are not
missing that boat and you haven't packed.

17:39.223 --> 17:42.841
I know I haven't,
and there's a good reason.

17:42.977 --> 17:45.016
I'm not going.

17:46.480 --> 17:48.224
<i>(laughter)</i>

17:49.483 --> 17:53.695
My brother still may be out there.
I've gotta look for him.

17:53.821 --> 17:59.610
- But where? Where do you start?
- I found Swarma. He told me. Sort of.

18:02.037 --> 18:03.615
Quatermain.

18:03.747 --> 18:06.618
We have planned this trip for six months.

18:06.750 --> 18:11.247
My parents have planned it. They've sent
invitations. We've arranged catering.

18:11.380 --> 18:13.539
You're worrying about hors d'oeuvres?

18:13.674 --> 18:16.130
Now, that's not fair.

18:22.892 --> 18:24.931
Well, when do we think about us?

18:25.060 --> 18:28.928
We're talking about my brother
and my best friends.

18:29.065 --> 18:30.689
What am I?

18:37.615 --> 18:43.451
Look, they've been gone so long...
and after what's happened here, it's...

18:43.579 --> 18:47.873
- It's dangerous and it's crazy.
- And it's what I've gotta do.

18:48.918 --> 18:50.744
Fine.

18:51.837 --> 18:54.708
And going to America is what I have to do.

19:01.472 --> 19:04.638
I just don't think I'm being unreasonable.

19:04.767 --> 19:07.554
Do you think I'm being unreasonable?

19:07.686 --> 19:10.438
Of course I'm not being unreasonable.

19:10.564 --> 19:14.016
A relationship is give-and-take.

19:14.151 --> 19:16.607
I feel like I'm doing all the giving.

19:16.737 --> 19:19.145
You know what I mean, George?

19:21.033 --> 19:23.109
What do you think, George?

19:23.244 --> 19:25.402
I think I should drive, madam.

19:27.790 --> 19:31.835
The rumours say, Mackenzie,
that we travel east past Lekanisera.

19:31.961 --> 19:36.041
The ruins of Jalpora are supposed to lie
between here and the Tana river.

19:36.173 --> 19:40.835
That's just the problem, Quatermain.
Too many rumours and not enough facts.

19:40.970 --> 19:46.130
Ah, hell, Dutchman. Half of Africa's been
explored on rumour, hope and legend.

19:46.267 --> 19:47.465
Yes.

19:47.601 --> 19:49.677
And blood.

19:49.812 --> 19:53.644
Too many people going off into
unexplored Africa and not coming back.

19:53.774 --> 19:56.182
I outfitted your brother's group last year.

19:56.318 --> 20:00.268
- The last I'll see of that equipment.
- I wouldn't bet my lungs on that.

20:00.406 --> 20:04.735
I'm gonna put a party together,
one way or the other, or I go alone.

20:04.869 --> 20:07.704
You'll do it, too, won't you?

20:07.830 --> 20:11.281
Not knowing where you're going,
and getting lost as hell.

20:11.417 --> 20:15.201
All right, let's go see
if we can buy you some help.

20:23.512 --> 20:26.964
Sure, we've been planning
this trip for months.

20:27.099 --> 20:29.721
OK, so that's one against him.

20:29.852 --> 20:35.190
But after all, isn't his concern for his
family and his friends part of his appeal?

20:35.316 --> 20:37.355
Oh, hell, George.

20:38.736 --> 20:42.733
He needs me. As a matter of fact
he can't live without me.

20:54.627 --> 20:56.619
Whee!

21:00.257 --> 21:02.084
Yahoo!

21:07.139 --> 21:11.089
<i>(Quatermain)</i> How would you like to go
on an expedition to East Africa?

21:11.227 --> 21:13.634
Yeah, East Africa. You'll love it.

21:13.771 --> 21:15.728
We leave tomorrow.

21:15.856 --> 21:17.896
Maybe next time.

21:20.986 --> 21:26.229

Tumatas, who'll desert you,

or the Mapaki, who'll eat you.

21:33.499 --> 21:38.125
With all this going for me,
who needs to worry about getting lost?

21:46.387 --> 21:48.463
Ah, mighty chief.

21:48.597 --> 21:53.840
Slayer of elephants, eater-up of lions,
clever one, watchful one,

brave one, quick one,

Grasp a hand and hold it
to the death. Quatermain.

22:02.486 --> 22:05.487
That's me, all right.

22:05.614 --> 22:07.523
Am I a stranger now?

22:07.658 --> 22:08.654
Yah!

Hey, that's OK. I get the idea.
I'm glad to see you too.

22:27.970 --> 22:30.176
You're a long way from home, aren't you?

22:30.306 --> 22:35.892
I who am highborn, ay,
of the blood of a great king - a chief.

22:36.020 --> 22:41.975
I am a wanderer. A man without a kraal,
with nought save my axe.

22:42.693 --> 22:45.729
And you, Quatermain, why are you here?

22:47.114 --> 22:50.530
I'm trying to put together a party
to go into East Africa,

22:50.659 --> 22:53.281
but everybody but me is too smart to go.

22:53.412 --> 22:55.868
They live and breathe fear. Not I.

22:55.998 --> 22:59.201
Let the blow come quickly
and the blood run red.

22:59.335 --> 23:04.542
I travel with five Askari
over whom I hold much influence.

23:04.673 --> 23:07.378
- You have your party.
- Ah.

23:07.509 --> 23:09.169
Quatermain.

23:09.303 --> 23:11.972
Careful there.
That one's got a bloodthirst.

23:12.097 --> 23:16.676
He also has five Askari
over whom he holds much influence.

23:24.235 --> 23:26.274
Thank you.

23:50.427 --> 23:52.467
Well, well, well.

23:53.514 --> 23:58.805
Your image has haunted me, sir, and that
of your brother and the friends you seek.

23:58.936 --> 24:05.223
I could not rest easy were I to let you
embark on a journey of such peril alone,

24:05.359 --> 24:09.357
when it is I who possess
the legend's secrets.

24:10.364 --> 24:13.365
- I guess that means you wanna come.
- No, no, no.

24:13.492 --> 24:18.403
I don't want to come, but, sir,
it is a journey through legend,

24:18.539 --> 24:23.699
shrouded in mystery, which I,
as your humble guide, will unravel.

24:23.836 --> 24:27.086
Gee, and I thought it was just a trek
into unexplored Africa.

24:37.766 --> 24:39.806
<i>(speaks Arabic)</i>

24:57.328 --> 25:01.195
- Sir, a mystic experience awaits us.
- <i>(screaming)</i>

25:04.126 --> 25:06.083
- Oh, no, it can't be.
- Yes.

25:12.676 --> 25:15.547
I recognise that scream.

25:19.475 --> 25:21.099
<i>(screams)</i>

25:33.197 --> 25:34.193
<i>(shrieks)</i>

25:36.325 --> 25:38.898
Attack! Attack!

25:50.297 --> 25:51.957
<i>(screams)</i>

25:52.091 --> 25:53.751
Hey, good-lookin'.

25:55.678 --> 25:57.504
Quatermain!

25:58.639 --> 26:02.388
Did you make a wrong turn?
America's about 6,000 miles that way.

26:02.518 --> 26:06.979
- I'm glad to see you, too, Quatermain.
- I'm glad, just surprised.

26:07.106 --> 26:10.190
We can always go to America.
We can always get married.

26:10.317 --> 26:12.393
- Yeah.
- Right now I should be with you.

26:12.528 --> 26:15.315
I want you to come
but you said it's too dangerous.

26:15.447 --> 26:20.442
- You can't get rid of me with a lecture.
- I don't want you to get hurt.

26:20.578 --> 26:24.492
I'm not gonna sit around worrying if
I'm gonna be a widow before I'm a bride.

26:24.623 --> 26:27.293
- Jesse.
- Please, you can't ask me to do that.

26:27.418 --> 26:31.000
- Jesse.
- I won't listen. You see? I'm not listening.

28:45.723 --> 28:48.344
The walls of Jalpora.

28:48.475 --> 28:51.761
Nice work. For a while I thought
we'd end up in Cleveland.

28:51.896 --> 28:55.062
Proof that only a fool questions
the wisdom of Swarma.

28:55.191 --> 28:59.438
Proof that even a blind monkey
sometimes finds a banana.

29:22.509 --> 29:24.336
Wait.

29:27.556 --> 29:29.763
<i>(Jesse shrieks)</i>

29:29.892 --> 29:32.727
The guardians of Jalpora.

29:32.853 --> 29:35.523
- Rough neighbourhood.
- Yeah.

29:50.454 --> 29:52.079
<i>(thunder)</i>

29:55.209 --> 29:58.329
Perhaps I should wait here.
Meditate on our journey.

29:58.462 --> 30:00.122
<i>(thunder)</i>

30:08.222 --> 30:11.057
It is the stirring of restless souls.

30:11.183 --> 30:13.306
What purpose do these walls serve?

30:13.435 --> 30:15.475
Religious, possibly?

30:16.730 --> 30:18.770
They don't belong here.

30:18.899 --> 30:21.983
These stones are 3,000 miles from home.

30:27.324 --> 30:29.198
- Gold.
- Gold?

30:30.536 --> 30:34.450
A golden sun setting on a river.
A fiery river.

30:41.130 --> 30:43.336
Did someone say "gold"?

30:43.466 --> 30:46.751
- Is there a river near here?
- The Tana.

30:52.766 --> 30:55.602
Maybe we follow the river to a golden sun.

30:55.728 --> 30:58.598
Or to a golden city.

31:25.549 --> 31:28.550
I think we're starting
to piss off somebody's god.

31:30.262 --> 31:32.421
<i>(Jesse and Quatermain scream)</i>

31:37.603 --> 31:39.726
- Oh, my God.
- No!

31:39.855 --> 31:41.895
It's Hudson.

31:48.823 --> 31:52.108
<i>(Jesse)</i> This is it, isn't it?
We're gonna die now.

31:52.242 --> 31:55.742
Please, the stone! Shove back the stone!

31:58.833 --> 32:01.750
Shove back the stone!

33:02.605 --> 33:05.522
Your legs! Your legs! Oh, God! Oh!

33:05.649 --> 33:07.772
Oh, God.

33:11.030 --> 33:13.069
You all right?

33:14.074 --> 33:17.693
The legend, of course, warned of this -

33:17.828 --> 33:21.114
the ground devouring intruders.

33:21.248 --> 33:24.913
The golden orb tempting the Fates.

33:26.337 --> 33:29.006
So it comes to pass.

34:38.993 --> 34:41.400
What's that?

34:43.998 --> 34:45.621
- An Eshowe.
- War dress.

34:45.748 --> 34:47.244
Yeah.

34:49.295 --> 34:51.868
<i>(speaks tribal language)</i>

34:56.010 --> 34:58.086
<i>(speaks tribal language)</i>

34:58.220 --> 35:00.628
That doesn't sound too friendly.

35:00.764 --> 35:05.806
It was friendly all right. He wants you
in exchange for using his river.

35:05.936 --> 35:08.344
Can't we strike some other arrangement?

35:08.480 --> 35:10.936
I'm sure going to try.

35:11.901 --> 35:14.570
<i>(speaks tribal language)</i>

35:23.245 --> 35:26.163
<i>(speak tribal language)</i>

35:31.754 --> 35:34.079
Please, must you upset him?

35:34.215 --> 35:39.375
Umslopogaas can't understand
why he prefers you to the tea kettle.

35:40.888 --> 35:41.883
<i>(yells)</i>

35:42.014 --> 35:44.054
<i>(others yell)</i>

36:05.079 --> 36:07.118
Oh, my God.

36:11.585 --> 36:16.959
- So, it was, I hope, a friendly parting?
- He hopes we enjoyed our last sunset.

36:17.091 --> 36:20.958
- So what do we do now? Turn back?
- Too late for that.

36:21.095 --> 36:23.586
We go as far as we can,
then sleep in the canoe.

36:23.722 --> 36:28.883
The Eshowe are territorial.
We just try to get out of their territory.

37:38.881 --> 37:40.423
<i>(yells)</i>

37:40.549 --> 37:41.830
<i>(groans)</i>

38:10.120 --> 38:13.703
Swarma, row. Jesse, reload.

38:18.838 --> 38:21.375
Try putting it in the water.

38:21.507 --> 38:24.710
Madam, I am a man of peace,
a man of prayer.

38:24.844 --> 38:28.047
Good. Then pray you don't
have to use this.

38:28.180 --> 38:29.639
Why?

38:33.727 --> 38:35.767
Oh, no! Please!

38:36.856 --> 38:38.563
Please!

38:47.908 --> 38:50.578
Do you think we passed them?

38:51.370 --> 38:53.493
<i>(Quatermain)</i> Not quite.

38:55.541 --> 38:57.581

<i>(battle cry)</i>

<i>(squeals)</i>

39:34.246 --> 39:36.286
Oh, my God.

39:44.757 --> 39:47.129
Swarma! The dynamite!

39:57.770 --> 39:59.015
<i>(yells)</i>

40:00.022 --> 40:01.682
<i>(tribesmen gasp)</i>

40:01.816 --> 40:03.475
Oh!

40:04.360 --> 40:07.314
The dynamite! Quick!

40:08.113 --> 40:10.153
<i>(tribesmen gasp)</i>

40:12.117 --> 40:14.608
- <i>(shouts) Duva! Duva!</i>
- What is it?

40:14.745 --> 40:17.450
The spear didn't harm me
so they think I'm a devil.

40:17.581 --> 40:21.164
- <i>(tribesmen chant) Duva! Duva!</i>
- Come on.

40:33.097 --> 40:35.422
<i>(tribesmen chant) Duva! Duva!</i>

41:16.056 --> 41:19.508
- Do you think they've given up?
- For now, anyway.

41:19.643 --> 41:23.059
Depends on how long
they're scared of the devil.

41:23.188 --> 41:24.932
Look!

42:21.872 --> 42:23.912
Hold on!

43:11.964 --> 43:14.918
<i>(Swarma)</i> Oh, I have died.

43:15.050 --> 43:17.339
I have died.

43:17.469 --> 43:21.170
Why did I not heed the legends
about this rotten trip?

43:21.307 --> 43:25.174
Have I entered into the shadows
with this whimpering wretch?

43:25.311 --> 43:28.762
I hate to disappoint you guys,
but I think we're still alive.

43:28.897 --> 43:31.898
<i>(Jesse)</i> And we've lost another Askari.

43:43.579 --> 43:44.777
<i>(growling)</i>

43:46.123 --> 43:48.032
<i>(Jesse groans)</i>

43:49.460 --> 43:51.867

<i>(Swarma whimpers)</i>

43:57.843 --> 44:00.844
<i>(Jesse moans and sobs)</i>

44:07.853 --> 44:11.933
- <i>(Jesse)</i> Feel the heat.
- <i>(Swarma)</i> We enter the Devil's Heart.

44:12.066 --> 44:15.020
<i>(Quatermain)</i>
Thanks for the words of encouragement.

44:15.152 --> 44:18.817
<i>(Jesse)</i> The water's hot too.
Are we going into a volcano?

44:18.947 --> 44:22.198
<i>(Quatermain)</i> No, just the Devil's Heart.

44:22.326 --> 44:24.153
<i>(sizzling)</i>

44:38.175 --> 44:41.046
Quatermain, what are we gonna do?

44:43.681 --> 44:45.305
<i>(rumbling)</i>

44:52.982 --> 44:54.606
Back-paddle.

45:06.203 --> 45:08.243
To the right.

45:09.665 --> 45:10.828
Pull.

45:13.294 --> 45:15.333
On the right.

45:36.066 --> 45:38.106
<i>(Askari screams)</i>

46:04.511 --> 46:06.800
This could be it.

46:06.931 --> 46:08.555
Great.

46:30.663 --> 46:32.121
<i>(screams)</i>

46:38.128 --> 46:39.753
Sorry.

46:42.716 --> 46:44.424
Where are we?

46:44.552 --> 46:50.554
The river must have tossed us off
into an antechamber. Where exactly?

46:52.184 --> 46:55.849
- How are you?
- Oh, I don't know. Ouch.

46:55.980 --> 46:57.142
<i>(groans)</i>

46:57.273 --> 46:59.312
- Fine.
- Yeah?

47:00.109 --> 47:02.730
- What do we do now?
- We're a little vague on that.

47:02.862 --> 47:05.531
Swarma's run out of legend.

47:21.755 --> 47:24.163
I found some markings here
that might help.

47:24.300 --> 47:27.668
They're eroded but these look
like a native dialect

47:27.803 --> 47:31.053
and there's some French
around the corner here. There.

47:31.182 --> 47:33.221
And these.

47:35.769 --> 47:38.557
- It's Phoenician.
- What does it say?

47:39.857 --> 47:42.312
"Phoenicians speak of a golden temple."

47:42.443 --> 47:44.270
<i>(screams)</i>

47:48.073 --> 47:50.778
Jesse! Can you hear me?
Are you all right?

47:50.910 --> 47:56.284
Of course I'm not all right!
I just got sucked down this damn hole.

47:56.415 --> 47:58.455
She's all right.

48:01.712 --> 48:08.249
Jesse, take this lantern, see where you are
and tie the rope around your waist.

48:08.385 --> 48:10.627
I know where I am.

48:10.763 --> 48:13.432
Just get me out of here.

48:19.605 --> 48:23.982
Gold! There's gold blocks down here.

48:24.110 --> 48:28.403
Perhaps I should go down and help her.
Gold could be very heavy.

48:35.120 --> 48:37.991
<i>(Quatermain)</i>
What's goin' on? Are you all right?

48:38.123 --> 48:39.452

48:39.583 --> 48:44.126
- I'm coming down, honey.
- There's a bunch of dead people here!

48:55.224 --> 48:58.723
- <i>(Umslopogaas)</i> Are you all right?
- Yeah, we're all right.

48:58.852 --> 49:03.431
More than I can say for the rest of 'em.
It's a graveyard down here.

49:04.358 --> 49:06.232
Oh, no.

49:07.361 --> 49:10.730
- It's not your?
- No, no. It's Tremont.

49:12.241 --> 49:14.910
We just have to keep hoping.

49:16.620 --> 49:19.787
This kind of death goes hand in hand
with our kind of life.

49:19.915 --> 49:23.414
It's the price we pay
for living a great adventure.

49:27.131 --> 49:28.590
OK.

49:28.716 --> 49:30.755
Pull her up.

- <i>(both scream)</i>

50:39.704 --> 50:42.788
<i>(Swarma)</i> You don't need to ask me twice.

50:47.127 --> 50:52.667
<i>(Jesse)</i> Maybe this tunnel goes under
the lost city and keeps right on going.

50:52.800 --> 50:55.291
Or maybe it stops right here.

50:57.846 --> 50:59.886
Stand back.

51:02.852 --> 51:06.635
- There's no other choice.
- Quatermain!

51:08.649 --> 51:13.477
- I don't wanna do this.
- <i>(Quatermain)</i> Jump. You can make it.

Never in my life have I been so tempted.

52:26.602 --> 52:30.185
- It's getting hot in here.
- We must be near the volcanos.

52:30.314 --> 52:31.559
I hear breathing.

52:31.690 --> 52:33.730
- I don't hear anything.
- <i>(growling)</i>

52:33.859 --> 52:37.442
Flatten yourselves against the wall.
Take this.

- <i>(Quatermain)</i> Whole trip's felt that way.

The air is cooler, fresher.

53:45.806 --> 53:48.724
<i>(Quatermain)</i> It's coming from up ahead.

- <i>(Swarma)</i> Please, do not do that.
- <i>(Jesse)</i> What?

53:52.813 --> 53:55.055
<i>(Swarma)</i> Brush against my face.

53:55.191 --> 53:58.401
You can bet your last turban
it wasn't me, pal.

53:58.402 --> 54:04.156
Me neither. The breeze is getting stronger.

54:22.468 --> 54:24.875
Well...

54:25.012 --> 54:27.135
Well done.

55:31.495 --> 55:34.781
Look! The Lost City of Gold! It exists!

55:37.710 --> 55:43.166
I've seen some amazing things in my life
but never anything to compare with this.

56:15.039 --> 56:17.078
I sure hope Robeson's inside.

56:17.207 --> 56:19.533
Swarma's praying the natives are friendly.

56:19.668 --> 56:23.333
<i>(Quatermain)</i> Mackenzie was right
about the legend of the lost city.

56:23.464 --> 56:26.548
I wonder if he was right
about the lost race.

56:28.886 --> 56:31.922
<i>(Jesse)</i> Slow down, Quatermain.
Wait for me.

56:32.056 --> 56:34.725
<i>(Quatermain)</i> Come on, Swarma.

56:53.202 --> 56:57.069
- <i>(Jesse)</i> This is incredible.
- <i>(Swarma)</i> Just look at those doors.

56:57.206 --> 57:01.619
- <i>(Umslopogaas)</i> Prideful people.
- And a little ostentatious.

57:04.422 --> 57:05.453
Look.

57:07.383 --> 57:09.589
The white race does exist.

57:09.718 --> 57:13.799
Each discovery gives truth to the legend.
I amaze myself.

57:13.931 --> 57:18.011
Wait. They may not be as enthusiastic
as we are. I'll go check it out.

57:18.143 --> 57:20.183
- With Swarma.
- Me?

57:21.480 --> 57:22.939
But...

57:23.065 --> 57:24.559
<i>(growling)</i>

57:58.058 --> 58:00.134
A magnificent display of courage.

58:00.269 --> 58:06.105
I did not interfere because I did not wish
to intrude on such heroism.

58:06.233 --> 58:07.644
Oh, no!

58:10.905 --> 58:16.147
Look! Do you see what your stupid act of
barbarism has done? We're dead for sure.

58:16.285 --> 58:20.413
- <i>(Jesse)</i> Well, they seem friendly.
- <i>(Quatermain)</i> Yeah.

58:56.492 --> 59:01.320
- They're so trusting and friendly.
- They haven't met Swarma yet.

59:11.590 --> 59:13.630
For us?

59:18.263 --> 59:20.303
Mm. Mm!

59:29.984 --> 59:31.941
- Heavy.
- <i>(man)</i> Allan!

59:33.696 --> 59:35.688
Allan!

59:37.574 --> 59:38.950
Robeson.

59:39.076 --> 59:41.649
- Hey, little brother!
- Hey!

59:41.787 --> 59:44.195
- God!
- God!

59:44.331 --> 59:48.958
I can't believe it. You're here. Dumont
got through. What are you doing here?

59:49.086 --> 59:53.166
We were in the neighbourhood.
I thought I'd drop by. What do you mean?

59:53.299 --> 59:55.540
Excuse me. Hi.

59:55.676 --> 59:59.045
I'm Jesse Huston, and this
could have been our honeymoon.

59:59.179 --> 01:00:01.931
- What?
- Umslopogaas, the great warrior.

01:00:02.057 --> 01:00:04.679
Gold, you see. Gold everywhere.

01:00:04.810 --> 01:00:09.306
And no weapons. You'd think with all
the gold they'd be armed, but they're not.

01:00:09.440 --> 01:00:15.644
It's wonderful just to see...
to... to see such peace.

01:00:15.779 --> 01:00:19.647
Such tranquility does the soul
of a holy man good.

01:00:19.783 --> 01:00:24.742
- Swarma's our spiritual leader.
- The man is a useless hollow reed.

01:00:24.872 --> 01:00:27.078
May I slay him?

01:00:27.207 --> 01:00:28.322
Come.

01:00:28.459 --> 01:00:30.784
<i>(speaks ancient language)</i>

01:00:35.299 --> 01:00:37.790
I told you your Japanese
would come in handy.

01:00:37.927 --> 01:00:43.003
I told them you were my brother.
So, how are you? And Dumont, how's he?

01:00:43.140 --> 01:00:46.805
I'm fine. He's dead. I'm glad you're OK.

01:00:46.935 --> 01:00:48.394
<i>(gong)</i>

01:00:52.274 --> 01:00:54.600
Except for that guy, you'll like it here.

01:00:54.735 --> 01:00:57.605
- What's going on?
- That's Agon, the high priest.

01:00:57.738 --> 01:01:00.525
<i>(speaks ancient language)</i>

01:01:05.120 --> 01:01:07.409
He says you committed a sacrilege.

01:01:07.539 --> 01:01:10.576
- We just got here.
- You killed a lion, the sacred beast.

01:01:10.709 --> 01:01:13.627
Saved a child
from being eaten, you mean.

01:01:13.754 --> 01:01:15.794
<i>(speaks ancient language)</i>

01:01:28.102 --> 01:01:30.178
No. Go with them.

01:01:35.109 --> 01:01:38.312
Boy, first impressions
sure can be deceiving.

01:01:38.445 --> 01:01:41.731
Just when I was starting
to like these people.

01:02:16.650 --> 01:02:17.895
<i>(Umslopogaas yells)</i>

01:02:18.027 --> 01:02:21.526
Please, must you offend <i>everyone?</i>

01:02:23.031 --> 01:02:25.357
<i>(speaks ancient language)</i>

01:02:26.869 --> 01:02:28.493
Sorais.

01:02:32.249 --> 01:02:37.457
Sorais. She and her sister Nyleptha
share the rule as queens.

01:02:40.716 --> 01:02:42.625
<i>(gong)</i>

01:02:42.760 --> 01:02:45.630
<i>(guard speaks ancient language)</i>

01:02:45.763 --> 01:02:47.590
Nyleptha.

01:02:47.723 --> 01:02:51.555
People love Nyleptha
but they're scared of Agon.

01:02:57.149 --> 01:03:00.020
<i>(both speak ancient language)</i>

01:03:02.446 --> 01:03:05.862
I am wary of people ruled by women

01:03:05.991 --> 01:03:10.320
for, like women, they may quickly
change from friend to foe.

01:03:10.454 --> 01:03:13.241
Careful.
I taught Nyleptha and Agon English.

01:03:13.373 --> 01:03:18.748
Which one of you is going to die
for slaying our sacred beast?

01:03:23.842 --> 01:03:25.467
Me?

01:03:26.303 --> 01:03:27.678
But...

01:03:32.977 --> 01:03:36.393
I am like the venerable Agon - a priest.

01:03:38.649 --> 01:03:41.899
A man who respects the beliefs of others.

01:03:42.027 --> 01:03:44.862
I admire the venerable...

01:03:49.493 --> 01:03:53.491
By all that is holy,
someone has sought to mock me.

01:03:56.041 --> 01:03:58.912
It was the savage.

01:04:05.134 --> 01:04:10.555
Believe me. He hid these things
in my garments to make me the fool.

01:04:10.681 --> 01:04:13.801
You need no help from me to be the fool.

01:04:13.934 --> 01:04:19.640
And I will split your venerable head
if you speak more of sacrifice.

01:04:33.662 --> 01:04:35.287
<i>(beep)</i>

01:04:35.414 --> 01:04:36.612

<i>(speaks ancient language)</i>

01:04:45.716 --> 01:04:48.503
Get me outta here!

01:04:50.930 --> 01:04:53.172

01:05:24.672 --> 01:05:26.545
<i>(speaks ancient language)</i>

01:05:26.674 --> 01:05:30.292
That was a neat trick. He says
you're some kind of god, or a devil.

01:05:30.427 --> 01:05:32.753
<i>(speaks ancient language)</i>

01:05:54.702 --> 01:05:57.905
- Are you gods or devils?
- Neither, Your Majesty.

01:05:58.039 --> 01:06:00.992
We came to find my lost brother.

01:06:01.125 --> 01:06:03.164
Is he lost?

01:06:08.549 --> 01:06:10.292
Forgive our rude welcome.

01:06:10.426 --> 01:06:14.838
Agon is more interested in the power of gold
than in the great spirit of our temple.

01:06:14.972 --> 01:06:18.306
You must be tired.
You must rest and refresh.

01:06:19.476 --> 01:06:21.802
<i>(speaks ancient language)</i>

01:06:21.937 --> 01:06:24.607
Go with them. They will assist you.

01:06:36.076 --> 01:06:38.650
By the way, Q.

01:06:38.787 --> 01:06:42.488
- Nice shirt.
- Careful, kid. You'll blow my cover.

01:06:47.630 --> 01:06:49.669
<i>(screams and moans)</i>

01:07:31.340 --> 01:07:33.167
<i>(cackles)</i>

01:07:38.931 --> 01:07:41.885
<i>(Robeson)</i> This was like paradise
until Agon showed up.

01:07:42.017 --> 01:07:45.351
He was a slave trader from the north,
selling arms to the Eshowe.

01:07:45.479 --> 01:07:48.515
- They brought him here.
- From slave trader to high priest?

01:07:48.649 --> 01:07:51.401
- How?
- By preying on the fears of the people.

01:07:51.527 --> 01:07:55.192
He's created a cult of lion gods,
slavery, human sacrifice.

01:07:55.322 --> 01:07:56.733
And the gold?

01:07:56.865 --> 01:08:00.281
Agon uses the Eshowe to smuggle it.
The smelter's underground.

01:08:00.411 --> 01:08:05.120
- The punishment for going near is death.
- Robeson, why don't you leave with us?

01:08:05.249 --> 01:08:08.001
I'm in love with the people here.

01:08:10.212 --> 01:08:13.498
- And Nyleptha's an enemy?
- She fights them.

01:08:16.551 --> 01:08:17.880
<i>Aris Tima.</i>

01:08:18.011 --> 01:08:20.929
- That means welcome in our language.
- Thank you, Majesty.

01:08:38.782 --> 01:08:40.407
Hello?

01:08:40.993 --> 01:08:42.617
Hello?

01:08:43.578 --> 01:08:46.247
What is going on here?

01:09:10.272 --> 01:09:13.225
<i>(Agon)</i> You admire the gold statue?

01:09:14.109 --> 01:09:17.313
Quite a piece of art. Very realistic.

01:09:17.446 --> 01:09:20.529
Of course. You met him in the temple.

01:09:20.657 --> 01:09:23.362
A victim of Quatermain's magic.

01:09:31.710 --> 01:09:35.921
He was a good guard.
Now, a beautiful statue.

01:09:38.133 --> 01:09:40.707
You mean all these statues?

01:09:40.844 --> 01:09:45.305
They used to sculpt them by hand.
But good art takes so long.

01:09:45.890 --> 01:09:49.176
I make more efficient use of resources.

01:09:49.310 --> 01:09:52.645
- I admire efficiency.
- And you admire the gold.

01:09:52.773 --> 01:09:54.647
Gold?

01:09:54.775 --> 01:09:57.017
Pity how it turns men to fools.

01:09:57.153 --> 01:09:59.311
Ah, but you're so wise.

01:10:01.156 --> 01:10:05.070
Well, I am a humble man
but, yes, yes, I am wise.

01:10:06.078 --> 01:10:10.407
You know the secrets
of Quatermain's powers.

01:10:10.541 --> 01:10:13.826
Is he a god? Or a devil spirit?

01:10:13.961 --> 01:10:17.330
Quatermain?
Why, he is no more a god than I...

01:10:20.008 --> 01:10:23.674
I mean, I am more a god.

01:10:23.804 --> 01:10:25.843
Greater powers.

01:10:32.813 --> 01:10:35.055
Quatermain brings evil here.

01:10:35.190 --> 01:10:38.275
Sorais is afraid that her sister
is too weak to stop it.

01:10:38.402 --> 01:10:41.487
But if you teach us the
secrets, we stop it.

01:10:47.286 --> 01:10:49.325
Secrets for me...

01:10:51.498 --> 01:10:53.740
gold for you.

01:11:47.721 --> 01:11:49.346
Oh!

01:11:54.729 --> 01:11:57.813
- How you doin'?
- You really like these people, don't you?

01:11:57.940 --> 01:12:02.068
Look around, Q. These people have
lived together in peace for centuries.

01:12:02.194 --> 01:12:04.567
Where can you find this
in the modern world?

01:12:04.697 --> 01:12:06.736
Cleveland?

01:12:07.533 --> 01:12:09.572
There you go.

Oh, it's a lifetime's worth of study.

01:12:43.360 --> 01:12:46.195

Uh-oh.

01:14:11.365 --> 01:14:15.659

your big opportunity.

As you destroyed the stone bench,
so can you destroy this.

01:19:57.670 --> 01:19:59.876
And he smells.

01:20:00.464 --> 01:20:03.418
- I will explain this to Nasta.
- But...

01:20:05.427 --> 01:20:09.092
Possibly enthusiasm for battle.
Much to be admired.

01:20:09.223 --> 01:20:11.975
- <i>(speaks tribal language)</i>
- Much to be admired.

01:20:12.101 --> 01:20:14.508
Much to be admired.

01:20:15.646 --> 01:20:18.102
Much to be admired.

01:20:34.540 --> 01:20:38.123
Please to warn him.
I'm overcome with anger.

01:20:41.130 --> 01:20:44.084
He joins us in battle.

01:20:44.591 --> 01:20:46.917
<i>(speaks ancient language)</i>

01:20:48.470 --> 01:20:53.678
He's worried about the devil's magic,
but... I told him that you have stolen it.

01:20:53.809 --> 01:20:56.098
That you are a friend.

01:21:07.239 --> 01:21:09.362
<i>(crowd gasps)</i>

01:21:09.491 --> 01:21:11.863

<i>(crowd chants)</i>

01:21:36.393 --> 01:21:41.221
- We're their last and only hope.
- We have to find a way to help them.

01:21:54.453 --> 01:21:58.071
- Where are the rest of the weapons?
- You're looking at 'em.

01:21:58.207 --> 01:22:03.083
Brother, we better start thinkin'.
Do you have any heavier metals?

01:22:03.212 --> 01:22:05.668
No, but we have gold.

01:22:08.717 --> 01:22:12.715
I am a man of peace, not a warrior,
so if you will just pay me my gold,

01:22:12.846 --> 01:22:18.719
and provide me my bearers, I will be
returning home to spread your teachings.

01:22:18.853 --> 01:22:23.313
Tell that to our warriors
who wait for your guidance.

<i>(speaks tribal language)</i>

01:22:25.860 --> 01:22:30.569
Should I not stay behind and
guard against attack from the rear?

01:22:30.698 --> 01:22:32.655
<i>(yells)</i>

01:22:40.290 --> 01:22:43.457
Wow, with this much gold
we can make plenty of weapons.

01:22:43.586 --> 01:22:46.255
We can hold the city for weeks.

01:23:04.148 --> 01:23:05.975
<i>(chanting)</i>

01:23:19.038 --> 01:23:22.786
OK, fellas, I know this stuff is heavy,
but move out.

<i>(shouting in ancient language)</i>

01:23:51.779 --> 01:23:54.649
<i>(Quatermain)</i> Quick! Come on! Come on!

01:23:55.699 --> 01:23:59.364
Half of you over there.
The other half come with me.

01:23:59.495 --> 01:24:02.579
Up on the walls as quickly as you can.

01:24:18.639 --> 01:24:22.637
- My God, it's the Eshowe.
- Now what do you want me to tell them?

01:24:22.768 --> 01:24:26.351
- Look confident or the people will crack.
- Sure.

01:24:26.480 --> 01:24:29.267
As soon as my knees stop shaking.

01:24:44.498 --> 01:24:46.538

01:24:56.385 --> 01:24:59.421
I welcome you.

01:25:00.890 --> 01:25:06.844
Who will first taste the
sweet gift of steel?

No, no, not yet.

01:25:52.608 --> 01:25:54.647
OK, now!

01:26:00.950 --> 01:26:04.698

Robeson, get everyone off the walls
and get them into the temple.

<i>(shouts in ancient language)</i>

01:28:32.643 --> 01:28:36.854
- I'll hold these stairs against them.
- We're in your hands.

I, the slaughterer, the swift-footed...

I, Umslopogaas, holder of the axe...

01:28:49.618 --> 01:28:52.904
the son of kings, the wolfman.

01:28:53.372 --> 01:28:56.076
I challenge them.

The axe!

01:29:32.703 --> 01:29:34.113
The axe!

01:29:51.054 --> 01:29:54.887
Don't worry.
He's got everything under control.

It's not a bad place to be a hero.

Yeah, but, uh... I've been thinking
it's time for something else.

01:36:07.389 --> 01:36:09.845
Some other great adventure?
