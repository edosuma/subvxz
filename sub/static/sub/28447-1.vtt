04:27.961 --> 04:29.544
Sounds good, man.

04:30.426 --> 04:31.560
Thank you.

04:31.562 --> 04:32.961
No Problem.

04:32.963 --> 04:33.963
God bless.

05:06.002 --> 05:07.378
Hi, Jack.

05:10.535 --> 05:11.608
It's me, Bridget.

05:12.959 --> 05:14.011
You know.

05:14.013 --> 05:16.050
Yeah, yeah, hi.

05:16.052 --> 05:17.993
I saw you playing.

05:17.995 --> 05:19.145
It sounded really good.

05:20.291 --> 05:22.427
Thanks, thanks a lot, appreciate it.

05:22.793 --> 05:25.128
It's good to see you're still playing.

05:27.925 --> 05:30.035
What else have you been up to these days?

05:31.765 --> 05:34.546
Just stuff, things, you know.

05:34.548 --> 05:36.046
That's great.

05:36.463 --> 05:39.148
You know it really is good to see you.

05:41.935 --> 05:43.768
What's it been, 10 years now?

05:45.882 --> 05:47.632
Sounds about right.

05:48.885 --> 05:50.628
Well I'm sure you have some stories.

05:53.020 --> 05:53.853
A few.

05:56.543 --> 06:00.300
Well um, you know we
should grab dinner sometime,

06:00.302 --> 06:01.133
you know, catch up.

06:01.135 --> 06:04.225
Yeah, we should,
absolutely, sounds great.

06:05.503 --> 06:07.345
Well, what are you doing tonight?

06:11.866 --> 06:13.616
We're having lasagna.

06:46.222 --> 06:47.093
Just give me a few minutes.

06:47.095 --> 06:49.580
I gotta give the husband the 411.

06:49.582 --> 06:52.196
You can go ahead and park behind me.

06:52.198 --> 06:53.031
Okay.

07:17.393 --> 07:19.893
What the fuck am I doing here?

07:28.385 --> 07:31.810
Oh, Jesus Christ, holy shit.

07:34.377 --> 07:36.076
She's married, no big deal.

07:36.078 --> 07:37.661
She's just married.

08:04.138 --> 08:05.221
All righty.

08:29.240 --> 08:32.073
So how do you two know each other?

08:35.083 --> 08:35.917
We were in school together.

08:35.926 --> 08:36.759
I told you about it.

08:38.015 --> 08:40.043
I don't remember a Jack.

08:40.044 --> 08:41.847
Honey, I've mentioned him.

08:46.163 --> 08:48.246
Well, how did you meet?

08:49.245 --> 08:51.743
Mrs. Sullivan's class, third grade.

08:51.745 --> 08:53.593
Good year.

08:53.595 --> 08:55.443
Taught us how to write in cursive.

08:55.445 --> 08:57.782
Turns out they don't
really do that anymore.

08:57.784 --> 08:59.463
I'm not really sure why that is.

08:59.465 --> 09:02.465
We didn't really get to know
each other until high school.

09:03.415 --> 09:05.893
Freshman year, first game of the season.

09:05.895 --> 09:06.795
Football player?

09:08.035 --> 09:09.663
Drums and percussion.

09:09.665 --> 09:11.776
Musician, man of my own heart.

09:11.778 --> 09:13.124
Oh, you play?

09:13.126 --> 09:14.418
I dabble.

09:15.685 --> 09:17.483
Our football team wasn't too good,

09:17.485 --> 09:20.418
so most of the time Jack
and I just mess around.

09:22.726 --> 09:25.482
I take it you
were in the marching band.

09:25.484 --> 09:26.613
I was.

09:26.615 --> 09:27.743
Three and a half years.

09:27.745 --> 09:29.563
How did you manage the half?

09:29.565 --> 09:31.423
I decided to dedicate some of my time

09:31.425 --> 09:33.475
to some other extracurricular activities.

09:35.926 --> 09:37.308
I took a semester of art.

09:38.230 --> 09:39.063
Ah.

09:42.015 --> 09:43.803
Wait, you hate football.

09:43.805 --> 09:45.843
Why were you at the
game in the first place?

09:45.845 --> 09:47.767
Were you in marching band too?

09:47.769 --> 09:50.698
No, I was a cheerleader.

09:55.535 --> 09:56.368
Really?

09:57.385 --> 09:58.218
No.

09:59.555 --> 10:00.633
Yeah?

10:00.635 --> 10:02.558
Yeah, I was a cheerleader.

10:05.775 --> 10:06.673
Wow.

10:06.675 --> 10:08.598
I didn't realize you had the, uh,

10:10.617 --> 10:12.673
the, what word am I looking for?

10:12.675 --> 10:14.318
Coordination, you know?

10:15.265 --> 10:17.343
She was actually the head cheerleader.

10:17.345 --> 10:18.176
Really?

10:18.178 --> 10:19.948
The girl could move.

10:26.095 --> 10:28.663
So what is it you do, Jack?

10:28.665 --> 10:29.498
Meaning?

10:30.345 --> 10:34.058
Like work, what's your career?

10:35.195 --> 10:36.028
I play.

10:38.041 --> 10:38.968
You still banging away?

10:40.215 --> 10:42.638
Not as much as I'd
like to but yes, I bang.

10:45.775 --> 10:47.213
Well when's your next show?

10:47.215 --> 10:50.561
I know we'd love to come out and see you,

10:50.563 --> 10:52.438
see you banging away
at the drums, you know.

10:53.539 --> 10:55.281
And wouldn't that be great, sweetheart?

10:55.283 --> 10:57.493
Yeah, it would be.

10:57.495 --> 10:59.843
I'm actually between gigs right now.

10:59.845 --> 11:01.201
But I'll be sure to let you both know

11:01.203 --> 11:02.453
when I'm back on my feet.

11:04.505 --> 11:05.338
Yeah.

11:08.099 --> 11:09.783
I mean it must be tough, you know,

11:09.785 --> 11:10.753
keeping up with the business

11:10.755 --> 11:13.748
and consistently finding work.

11:20.755 --> 11:22.679
So who have you played with?

11:22.681 --> 11:24.228
What have you done?

11:25.902 --> 11:28.538
Uh, a few big name acts.

11:29.595 --> 11:30.795
Subbed in a tour or two.

11:32.695 --> 11:35.445
I've worked with a lot of up
and coming talent actually.

11:36.295 --> 11:37.919
Most of which stalled out,

11:37.921 --> 11:40.028
but it's a process.

11:41.422 --> 11:44.038
Right, well I'm sure
you're very talented.

11:45.145 --> 11:47.358
Like I said, between gigs.

11:58.925 --> 12:02.435
Ooh, sorry this is
work, I gotta take it.

12:30.795 --> 12:34.283
I'm sorry to cut the evening
short but that was work.

12:34.285 --> 12:35.253
They need me out on the first flight

12:35.255 --> 12:36.143
out to Seattle.

12:36.145 --> 12:37.307
Tonight?

12:37.309 --> 12:38.608
I'm sorry.

12:40.575 --> 12:41.924
This guy gets it.

12:41.926 --> 12:44.084
If Phil Collins needed
a replacement drummer,

12:44.086 --> 12:46.888
he'd be halfway around
the world, you know?

12:52.835 --> 12:56.688
I'll be back in two days, okay?

12:58.115 --> 13:00.650
Jack, it was great meeting you.

13:00.652 --> 13:01.488
You too.

13:04.145 --> 13:06.228
I'll be just a minute.

13:15.867 --> 13:16.700
Fuck.

13:22.785 --> 13:23.618
Fuck.

13:26.963 --> 13:29.633
So, what's in Seattle?

13:29.635 --> 13:31.553
Uh the Freeman deal might fall through.

13:31.555 --> 13:33.748
They want me to do damage control.

13:34.865 --> 13:36.483
They need you in Seattle for that?

13:36.485 --> 13:38.993
I mean, I don't know
what you want me to do.

13:38.995 --> 13:42.208
You know, they call me
like this every so often.

13:43.249 --> 13:45.253
Oh my God, these fucking drawers,

13:45.255 --> 13:46.948
can we get a new thing please?

13:52.555 --> 13:55.364
Is he still downstairs by himself?

13:55.366 --> 13:57.433
Oh, come on, he's fine.

13:57.435 --> 13:59.473
Look, Bridge, I know you knew the guy

13:59.475 --> 14:01.213
like a decade ago.

14:01.215 --> 14:02.313
Paul, come on.

14:02.315 --> 14:04.543
He's fine, I know him.

14:04.545 --> 14:07.053
No, you knew him, that's what that is.

14:07.055 --> 14:11.193
You haven't seen him in like 10 years.

14:11.195 --> 14:12.693
He's not fine.

14:12.695 --> 14:14.573
Look at him, he looks like Charles Manson.

14:14.575 --> 14:16.273
Oh my god.

14:16.275 --> 14:17.503
When's the last time he had a shower?

14:17.505 --> 14:19.305
I smelled him from across the table.

14:21.585 --> 14:23.081
So judgemental.

14:55.245 --> 14:56.645
Have you seen my passport?

14:58.565 --> 14:59.398
No.

15:10.165 --> 15:10.996
See what I mean?

15:10.998 --> 15:13.333
- These fucking drawers.
- Fucking drawers.

15:13.335 --> 15:15.552
Ah, thank you.

15:16.299 --> 15:17.308
He's living out of a car.

15:19.675 --> 15:22.275
What the hell were you
thinking inviting him here?

15:24.505 --> 15:27.712
Am I the only one that's
sane in this relationship?

15:27.714 --> 15:30.583
He's a good guy.

15:30.585 --> 15:31.523
That's not fine.

15:31.525 --> 15:33.013
Good guy, I don't care what he is.

15:33.015 --> 15:35.323
He's homeless living out of his car.

15:35.325 --> 15:37.413
Why are you bringing him into our home?

15:37.415 --> 15:39.015
What the hell were you thinking?

15:39.975 --> 15:42.325
Why do you need a
passport to go to Seattle?

15:43.895 --> 15:46.263
Look, I gotta go.

15:46.265 --> 15:48.493
I'm already late for my flight.

15:48.495 --> 15:49.628
Get him out of here.

15:52.725 --> 15:55.209
Homeless, what?

15:55.211 --> 15:56.798
He cannot stay.

16:09.015 --> 16:11.231
Jack, it was an absolute
pleasure to meet you.

16:11.233 --> 16:12.064
Oh.

16:12.066 --> 16:13.413
You too, Paul.

16:13.415 --> 16:15.369
Hopefully we can
do this again sometime.

16:15.371 --> 16:16.204
Absolutely.

16:24.198 --> 16:25.029
I need to get going.

16:25.031 --> 16:26.448
Okay.

16:30.896 --> 16:31.727
Would you like some more wine?

16:31.729 --> 16:33.728
No, thanks.

16:34.705 --> 16:35.538
Thank you.

16:36.438 --> 16:37.956
Actually, I should probably get going.

16:37.958 --> 16:40.291
What, no, no, not already.

16:41.355 --> 16:42.913
It was great seeing you.

16:42.915 --> 16:44.628
I really appreciate the meal.

16:46.665 --> 16:48.393
After all this time, that's it?

16:48.395 --> 16:52.328
Just a slice of lasagna
and a few glasses of wine?

16:54.655 --> 16:56.228
Come on, just one more drink.

16:58.474 --> 17:00.852
Well.

17:00.854 --> 17:01.937
I don't know.

17:02.891 --> 17:05.103
I wouldn't want to drink all your wine.

17:05.105 --> 17:06.068
I'm in a club.

17:24.765 --> 17:27.647
So, Jacky boy.

17:28.535 --> 17:30.853
Where have you been all my life?

17:30.855 --> 17:32.528
You know, around.

17:34.545 --> 17:36.303
What are the odds that
we run into each other

17:36.305 --> 17:37.468
after all this time?

17:38.655 --> 17:41.183
Well, statistically speaking I'd say

17:41.185 --> 17:43.293
most of our high school class
still lives in this town

17:43.295 --> 17:47.788
so eh, like 70-30 maybe?

18:02.238 --> 18:04.003
Did you ever call?

18:04.005 --> 18:04.838
Excuse me?

18:05.785 --> 18:07.728
Me, did you ever call me?

18:10.565 --> 18:12.638
I mean, I tried.

18:15.325 --> 18:16.975
What does that mean, you tried?

18:20.039 --> 18:22.833
There was one night where I called you

18:22.835 --> 18:24.678
over and over again.

18:25.775 --> 18:26.925
But you never answered.

18:28.455 --> 18:29.983
You were probably at a party

18:29.985 --> 18:31.133
or studying in the library.

18:31.135 --> 18:32.983
Massive orgy.

18:32.985 --> 18:34.883
It was always a massive orgy

18:34.885 --> 18:36.483
or a gangbang up at school.

18:37.263 --> 18:40.098
Okay, those things sound fun too.

18:46.745 --> 18:47.578
Sorry.

18:48.555 --> 18:51.213
I just, I didn't want to be a burden

18:51.215 --> 18:53.365
and it seemed like a
good idea at the time.

18:55.631 --> 18:57.265
I just wanted you to be happy.

19:01.377 --> 19:03.018
Well, mission accomplished.

19:17.150 --> 19:19.293
So how much does one have to make

19:19.295 --> 19:21.945
in order to afford a television
with a curved screen?

19:25.635 --> 19:28.953
That is one of Paul's toys.

19:28.955 --> 19:30.708
He loves his toys.

19:31.886 --> 19:32.717
And what does he do?

19:32.719 --> 19:34.363
With me?

19:34.365 --> 19:35.524
For money.

19:35.526 --> 19:38.163
Oh, he's in finance.

19:38.165 --> 19:41.503
He's a consultant for some
pretty high end clients.

19:41.505 --> 19:44.283
Hence him being called
away from his loving wife

19:44.285 --> 19:46.193
in the middle of the night.

19:46.195 --> 19:47.895
And he finds the money worth it?

19:49.882 --> 19:52.283
It's a beautiful television.

19:52.285 --> 19:55.300
It's a great picture from
anywhere in the house.

19:55.302 --> 19:56.135
I bet.

19:59.929 --> 20:02.263
So how did you two get together?

20:02.265 --> 20:03.682
What's the story?

20:07.595 --> 20:10.195
We're gonna need something
much stronger for that.

20:11.105 --> 20:11.938
Okay.

20:15.655 --> 20:16.620
Lead the way.

20:16.622 --> 20:18.455
All right.

20:19.332 --> 20:22.493
You know, the more you
build up anticipation,

20:22.495 --> 20:26.289
it just, it hurts, so maybe
you should tell the story.

20:27.575 --> 20:28.663
I'm sorry.

20:28.665 --> 20:31.028
I'm just trying to find my courage.

20:32.734 --> 20:34.768
Is it hidden within the vodka?

20:36.215 --> 20:37.048
Well.

20:40.945 --> 20:42.743
You know, I'm not too sure.

20:42.745 --> 20:45.743
But I will look for it.

20:45.745 --> 20:48.348
You're certainly
doing a very thorough check.

20:50.805 --> 20:52.713
Okay, okay, okay.

20:52.715 --> 20:56.578
So the story of me and Paul.

20:57.725 --> 21:00.583
It was my junior year and I just finished

21:00.585 --> 21:03.323
my last finals, so me and
a bunch of my girlfriends

21:03.325 --> 21:04.333
are going to the city.

21:04.335 --> 21:05.838
You know, drinks and a show.

21:07.195 --> 21:08.045
Theater?

21:10.455 --> 21:12.593
I was never really the theater type.

21:12.595 --> 21:15.428
We were looking for rock, something loud.

21:16.670 --> 21:18.238
Ooh, girl of my own heart.

21:20.270 --> 21:22.243
So anyway we ended up in this

21:22.245 --> 21:24.873
rundown dive bar, you know, the ones

21:24.875 --> 21:26.748
that the hipsters turn
into an organic tea bar

21:26.750 --> 21:28.308
five years later.

21:29.585 --> 21:31.923
Anyway, it was taco Tuesday.

21:31.925 --> 21:36.613
So we were devouring tacos
and downing margaritas

21:36.615 --> 21:39.083
like the tequila fountain was dry.

21:39.085 --> 21:41.111
How's the vodka fountain doing?

21:42.725 --> 21:43.675
That's answers my question.

21:46.454 --> 21:48.183
Go on, go on.

21:48.185 --> 21:49.533
Well.

21:49.535 --> 21:53.073
As we were enjoying our
little slices of heaven

21:53.075 --> 21:56.723
these yuppies from Wall Street came up

21:56.725 --> 21:58.453
and for lack of a better term

21:58.455 --> 22:00.663
were trying to spit game.

22:00.665 --> 22:01.708
What'd they say?

22:02.691 --> 22:05.433
That I can't really recall.

22:05.435 --> 22:07.063
Blacked out?

22:07.065 --> 22:10.373
No, they had had spicy tuna rolls

22:10.375 --> 22:12.903
from that sushi bar across the street.

22:12.905 --> 22:14.813
And their breaths collectively smelled

22:14.815 --> 22:18.348
like fish, tuna and spicy mustard.

22:18.350 --> 22:19.968
Ew, potent.

22:22.285 --> 22:23.883
He was like a knight.

22:23.885 --> 22:26.093
Gallant, brave.

22:26.095 --> 22:28.188
Did he challenge them to a duel?

22:28.190 --> 22:30.233
Um, no.

22:30.235 --> 22:32.950
He pretended to be my lover.

22:32.952 --> 22:33.823
Ugh.

22:33.825 --> 22:36.748
But it was enough to
scare the yuppies off.

22:37.685 --> 22:39.868
Then he bought me my fourth margarita.

22:42.227 --> 22:44.133
What was it called?

22:44.135 --> 22:44.966
What, where we met?

22:44.968 --> 22:46.730
Yeah, the bar, what was it called?

22:46.732 --> 22:48.083
Uh, the Alibi Room.

22:48.085 --> 22:49.447
No shit.

22:49.449 --> 22:50.280
What?

22:50.282 --> 22:51.423
I played there.

22:51.425 --> 22:53.240
You played at the Alibi Room?

22:53.242 --> 22:54.713
Yeah yeah, absolutely.

22:54.715 --> 22:55.883
When were you there?

22:55.885 --> 22:57.380
What was the day?

22:57.382 --> 23:01.908
Uh, June 29th I think?

23:03.265 --> 23:05.679
You're joking, you're playing with me.

23:05.681 --> 23:06.512
You're pulling my leg, right?

23:06.514 --> 23:07.475
Why would you say that?

23:08.555 --> 23:09.388
Ah.

23:10.450 --> 23:13.166
I was there the day before.

23:13.168 --> 23:14.893
On the 28th I was there.

23:14.895 --> 23:15.945
That's when I played.

23:16.785 --> 23:17.616
That year?

23:17.618 --> 23:19.775
Yeah, that year, if
I'm doing my math right.

23:21.752 --> 23:22.585
Fuck.

23:24.445 --> 23:27.448
You're right, definitely need
something stronger for this.

23:31.665 --> 23:33.115
I should probably stop though

23:33.839 --> 23:35.663
before I'm too drunk to drive.

23:36.196 --> 23:39.013
I think
you're already past that.

23:39.015 --> 23:42.093
I'm quite happy to say
that I'm very capable

23:42.095 --> 23:43.145
of holding my liquor.

23:44.565 --> 23:45.398
In my mouth.

23:50.425 --> 23:53.738
So um, where are you staying these days?

23:56.855 --> 23:58.005
You know where.

23:59.425 --> 24:00.275
Stay.

24:01.225 --> 24:02.088
I can't stay.

24:03.330 --> 24:04.178
Why not?

24:05.355 --> 24:06.648
You know why not.

24:08.005 --> 24:09.633
Give me one reason.

24:09.635 --> 24:11.228
The night is young.

24:15.748 --> 24:16.912
Oh my god.

24:18.692 --> 24:20.873
You're very convincing.

24:20.875 --> 24:21.713
Very, very good.

24:21.715 --> 24:24.290
I know.

24:24.292 --> 24:25.702
The night is young.

24:28.647 --> 24:29.803
Oh god.

24:29.805 --> 24:30.638
Okay.

24:32.825 --> 24:35.078
Bartender, more wine!

24:44.655 --> 24:46.328
Nothing could beat this.

24:49.633 --> 24:50.983
The quiet calmness of home.

24:54.215 --> 24:55.508
Remember prom night?

24:57.925 --> 24:58.878
Under the stars?

25:00.075 --> 25:01.243
Yeah.

25:01.245 --> 25:03.023
You were so nervous that night

25:03.025 --> 25:06.033
you puked in the bushes
before you rang the doorbell.

25:06.035 --> 25:06.925
You saw that?

25:07.852 --> 25:09.509
Oh no.

25:09.511 --> 25:10.342
So, wow.

25:10.344 --> 25:11.177
Oh my God.

25:13.873 --> 25:15.433
What an odd night.

25:15.435 --> 25:16.268
Which part?

25:17.245 --> 25:19.115
The DJ that kept playing EDM

25:20.732 --> 25:22.543
or the stale salad and dry chicken

25:22.545 --> 25:23.868
they served us for dinner?

25:25.212 --> 25:26.863
I'd say the whole fiasco

25:26.865 --> 25:29.303
if we were being completely honest.

25:29.305 --> 25:30.953
Absolutely.

25:30.955 --> 25:32.605
Afterward wasn't so bad though.

25:33.865 --> 25:35.913
All we needed was a blanket and the waves

25:35.915 --> 25:36.908
to help us sleep.

25:40.405 --> 25:43.349
Well, if we're being completely honest,

25:43.351 --> 25:45.823
I think you should know,

25:45.825 --> 25:47.618
I was never intending us sleeping.

25:49.045 --> 25:52.783
That I knew.

25:52.785 --> 25:54.143
You've always been very observant.

25:54.145 --> 25:56.229
I tell everyone that.

25:56.231 --> 25:57.231
Everyone on the street.

26:08.924 --> 26:10.538
Is that another one of Paul's toys?

26:12.495 --> 26:14.518
No, that one's mine.

26:16.295 --> 26:17.453
It's kind of late in the season

26:17.455 --> 26:20.767
but if you wanna go swimming,

26:20.769 --> 26:23.208
we could borrow some of Paul's trunks.

26:29.655 --> 26:30.605
What are you doing?

26:33.975 --> 26:35.503
Nothing.

26:35.505 --> 26:36.338
It's all good.

26:37.325 --> 26:38.198
Jack?

26:39.285 --> 26:40.676
Jack!

26:52.995 --> 26:54.348
What are you doing?

26:58.375 --> 27:00.883
It's not like you haven't
seen all this before.

27:00.885 --> 27:03.903
I promise you, not much has changed.

27:03.905 --> 27:05.088
Maybe for you.

27:06.635 --> 27:07.466
Oh, come on.

27:07.468 --> 27:10.018
Some things are just more
exciting in the nude.

27:12.598 --> 27:13.650
Right, how about this.

27:13.652 --> 27:15.205
How about we live tonight

27:16.705 --> 27:18.425
like it's the only night left to live.

27:21.019 --> 27:23.583
And what about tomorrow?

27:23.585 --> 27:25.185
We can worry about that later.

27:26.085 --> 27:30.392
But first, let's make it through tonight.

27:32.694 --> 27:34.574
It'll be great, I promise.

27:34.582 --> 27:36.065
The water's warm.

Oh, and if you want
any pajamas or anything

29:24.315 --> 29:27.368
there's some new ones
in the top drawer there.

29:28.585 --> 29:30.613
They were Paul's but
he just never used them

29:30.615 --> 29:32.378

I like this, this whole ensemble.

32:52.032 --> 32:52.865
Thanks.

32:54.645 --> 32:55.495
Couldn't sleep?

32:56.731 --> 32:59.396
Shouldn't I be asking you that?

32:59.398 --> 33:01.283
Oh, it's a very hard adjustment

33:01.285 --> 33:02.686
going from sleeping on the ground

33:02.688 --> 33:04.818
to sleeping on the clouds.

33:06.385 --> 33:07.583
I've slept in that bed,

33:07.585 --> 33:08.993
it's definitely not that soft.

33:08.995 --> 33:12.082
Oh, I beg to differ.

33:14.608 --> 33:15.528
You want some coffee?

33:19.695 --> 33:21.278
How about breakfast?

33:21.280 --> 33:22.111
Now?

33:22.113 --> 33:25.966
Well it is technically the morning.

33:25.968 --> 33:28.301

33:30.128 --> 33:32.206

How was that for you?

34:36.159 --> 34:38.775
Delicious.

34:38.777 --> 34:40.398
I knew you'd like it.

34:40.400 --> 34:42.478
It's my specialty, I'm telling you.

34:42.480 --> 34:44.259
That cheesy eggs, yeah.

34:52.428 --> 34:54.943
You know, I used to go
camping all the time

34:54.945 --> 34:56.998
when I was a kid with my cousins.

34:58.435 --> 35:00.998
They're all like 10
years older than me, so

35:01.000 --> 35:01.985
they took me under their wing

35:03.718 --> 35:05.218
and showed me the ropes, so to speak.

35:08.995 --> 35:10.538
I used to love those trips.

35:12.315 --> 35:15.658
We'd make smores and
roast hotdogs on the fire.

35:17.175 --> 35:18.593
And pick blueberries, blackberries

35:18.595 --> 35:20.778
and whatever other color berry there is.

35:21.775 --> 35:23.975
And we'd just live off
the land as best we could.

35:25.425 --> 35:26.758
Ah, I loved it.

35:31.005 --> 35:33.688
We'd stay out there for
a week, sometimes two.

35:38.335 --> 35:41.063
We actually, we adopted this rule where

35:41.065 --> 35:42.403
once we ran out of toilet paper

35:42.405 --> 35:43.368
we'd head home.

35:44.755 --> 35:45.923
We did that 'cause this one time

35:45.925 --> 35:47.753
my one cousin, he got a...

35:47.755 --> 35:51.298
I get the point.

35:56.691 --> 35:57.983
Yeah, my parents always freaked out

35:57.985 --> 35:59.585
when we're on the freaking trip.

36:00.785 --> 36:02.343
They're the kind of people that

36:02.345 --> 36:04.693
they always want everything
planned out, you know,

36:04.695 --> 36:05.598
mapped to a T.

36:08.165 --> 36:08.998
Not me though.

36:10.545 --> 36:11.995
I loved every second of that.

36:12.895 --> 36:14.297
Ooh.

36:16.369 --> 36:17.200
Ow!

36:17.202 --> 36:18.033
You okay?

36:18.035 --> 36:20.065
- Burned yourself?
- Yeah.

36:20.067 --> 36:21.298
It's hot.

36:22.275 --> 36:23.473
Try mine.

36:23.475 --> 36:24.308
But be careful.

36:27.525 --> 36:28.692
Yup.

36:28.694 --> 36:30.053
I told you.

36:30.055 --> 36:30.918
I warned you.

36:33.391 --> 36:34.224
I never thought

36:36.325 --> 36:38.130
things would ever be better

36:38.132 --> 36:39.228
than they were on those trips.

36:43.055 --> 36:43.938
And were you right?

36:44.815 --> 36:46.138
Answer's still pending.

36:47.676 --> 36:49.843
I'll have to let you know.

36:57.205 --> 36:58.138
So um,

36:59.795 --> 37:01.395
how long have you been homeless?

37:02.475 --> 37:03.903
I have a home.

37:03.905 --> 37:04.738
Your car.

37:06.635 --> 37:08.733
It's a roof over my head.

37:08.735 --> 37:10.077
That's enough.

37:10.079 --> 37:10.912
Is it?

37:18.885 --> 37:22.013
So you still as limber
as you used to be?

37:22.015 --> 37:23.634
Excuse me?

37:23.636 --> 37:24.467
You know what I'm talking about.

37:24.469 --> 37:26.593
Listen, I know I look great for my age

37:26.595 --> 37:28.978
but trust me, mostly smoke and mirrors.

37:28.980 --> 37:30.834
I can't do any of the stuff we used to do.

37:30.836 --> 37:32.193
Well, most of it.

37:32.195 --> 37:33.954
There's some things.

37:33.956 --> 37:36.568
Hmm, let's find out.

37:38.325 --> 37:40.068
I like it, you have the spirit.

37:42.015 --> 37:45.773
By all means,
please. Oh I'm gonna love this.

37:47.215 --> 37:48.048
Yes!

37:49.836 --> 37:51.903
Are you ready?

37:51.905 --> 37:52.738
Okay.

37:56.365 --> 37:57.913
Go Big Blue!

37:57.915 --> 38:00.263
Go Big Blue!

38:00.265 --> 38:01.893
Go Big Blue!

38:01.895 --> 38:03.238
Go Big Blue!

38:05.391 --> 38:06.632
Whoah, fire, fire.

38:06.634 --> 38:08.217
- Woo!
- Oh my god.

38:10.085 --> 38:11.148
That was frightening.

38:12.665 --> 38:13.773
Wow.

38:13.775 --> 38:18.235
Girl, you are ready for ESPN prime time.

38:18.237 --> 38:20.153
Easy there, Tiger.

38:20.155 --> 38:21.293
I need a break.

38:21.295 --> 38:23.953
Low stamina.

38:23.955 --> 38:25.735
I have never had that problem.

38:36.959 --> 38:40.093
I always wondered how you did that.

38:40.095 --> 38:41.433
What?

38:41.435 --> 38:43.098
Your fingers.

38:44.515 --> 38:45.348
Oh, uh.

38:47.210 --> 38:48.933
I just kind of do it.

38:48.935 --> 38:50.138
Could you teach me?

38:51.145 --> 38:52.920
How to tap your fingers?

38:52.922 --> 38:54.103
Yes.

38:54.105 --> 38:55.428
Really?

38:57.344 --> 38:59.665
Ooh, yes.

38:59.667 --> 39:00.500
Teach me.

39:02.947 --> 39:04.364
Ah wow.

39:05.923 --> 39:07.590
Come on.

39:09.828 --> 39:10.848
Ah, all right.

39:12.314 --> 39:13.795
Two minutes.

39:13.797 --> 39:16.355
Two minutes?

39:16.357 --> 39:17.188
Two minutes.

39:17.190 --> 39:18.443
Where are you going?

39:18.445 --> 39:19.798
Don't burn yourself.

39:37.685 --> 39:39.593
Nice bongo.

39:39.595 --> 39:42.353
Actually, it's called a Djembe.

39:42.355 --> 39:43.186
Bless you.

39:43.188 --> 39:44.021
No, no, that's,

39:45.585 --> 39:46.613
you're hilarious.

39:46.615 --> 39:48.688
You're so funny, so cute.

39:49.875 --> 39:52.703
Oh teach me your ways, wise master.

39:52.705 --> 39:54.343
So.

39:54.345 --> 39:58.743
The Djembe, what you're gonna do is

39:58.745 --> 40:01.272
take the meaty part of your hand,

40:01.274 --> 40:03.033
hit it there, right.

40:03.035 --> 40:05.063
The meaty part, you know, like palm.

40:05.065 --> 40:06.468
Just give it a smack there like that.

40:06.470 --> 40:07.763
See?

40:07.765 --> 40:09.633
So you get that sound.

40:09.635 --> 40:10.873
Take your fingertips.

40:10.875 --> 40:11.708
Hit this part.

40:14.314 --> 40:15.390
Completely different sound.

40:15.392 --> 40:17.323
Completely different sound, yeah.

40:17.325 --> 40:19.323
And you just kind of put it together.

40:32.175 --> 40:34.144
Those, those are the basics.

40:35.275 --> 40:37.773
Yeah, I think you figured it out.

40:37.775 --> 40:40.238
I mean, so what you're doing wrong is,

40:41.265 --> 40:43.265
so the power doesn't come from the hit.

40:45.149 --> 40:48.103
It comes from your wrist
and your fingertips.

40:48.105 --> 40:49.923
So you wanna use your
wrist and your fingers

40:49.925 --> 40:53.603
and just, so when you
bring your hand down,

40:53.605 --> 40:55.153
use your wrist.

40:55.155 --> 40:55.988
Like that.

40:57.625 --> 40:58.798
But let the drum like,

41:00.065 --> 41:02.378
let the drum work.

41:03.235 --> 41:04.624
See what I mean?

41:04.626 --> 41:05.973
Bring it back up.

41:05.975 --> 41:06.852
It rings out.

41:08.835 --> 41:09.668
You get it.

41:13.815 --> 41:14.688
We'll get there.

41:15.563 --> 41:17.183
Work in progress.

41:17.185 --> 41:20.228
That's it, just use your hands like that.

41:21.125 --> 41:21.958
Finesse.

41:24.146 --> 41:25.646
What about this?

41:27.525 --> 41:28.356
What about that?

41:28.358 --> 41:29.253
You're doing better already.

41:29.255 --> 41:31.978
See, I couldn't do the cheering thing.

41:32.905 --> 41:34.533
I could teach you.

41:34.535 --> 41:37.401
But we'll save that for another time.

41:37.403 --> 41:38.659
We could do some handstands.

41:38.661 --> 41:40.744
It will be educational.

41:42.220 --> 41:43.738
What about this?

41:44.722 --> 41:47.262
No, that's just nails on

41:47.264 --> 41:48.878
ooh chalkboard, it's uh.

41:49.835 --> 41:50.979
Please don't.

41:53.618 --> 41:55.266
Am I torturing you?

41:55.268 --> 41:56.428
No, not at all.

41:57.463 --> 41:58.296
It's good.

42:04.162 --> 42:05.219
I miss it.

42:05.221 --> 42:06.054
Me too.

42:43.882 --> 42:45.465
Just give me a minute.

43:24.622 --> 43:26.128
Where did you go?

43:36.425 --> 43:39.318
Philadelphia, Boston, L.A.

43:40.562 --> 43:42.228
A short stint in New Orleans.

43:45.078 --> 43:46.828
That's not what I meant.

43:48.925 --> 43:50.175
Why didn't you come back?

43:54.825 --> 43:56.648
What was I supposed to come back to?

43:57.927 --> 43:58.760
Me.

44:00.626 --> 44:02.176
You could have came back to me.

44:05.564 --> 44:08.522
You didn't want me to come back.

44:08.524 --> 44:09.774
You're right.

44:11.026 --> 44:12.776
I wanted you to stay.

44:32.586 --> 44:33.836
Come with me.

44:36.066 --> 44:38.316
I wanna show you something.

44:46.180 --> 44:48.430
It's roomier than it looks.

44:51.063 --> 44:51.980
Come on.

45:05.294 --> 45:06.377
This is it.

45:10.682 --> 45:12.015
This is my life.

45:14.497 --> 45:15.330
My home.

45:18.597 --> 45:21.347
This is where my path has led me.

45:24.316 --> 45:27.899
If I could do it again
I would have stayed.

45:30.695 --> 45:35.679
Yeah but, this led you back here to me.

45:40.535 --> 45:43.535
So what are we supposed to do now?

45:44.455 --> 45:45.705
I don't know.

46:24.574 --> 46:26.135
You know, for a housewife,

46:26.137 --> 46:29.415
you sure can party like it's 1999.

46:29.417 --> 46:32.803
First of all, I'm not a housewife.

46:32.805 --> 46:34.473
I'm in marketing.

46:34.475 --> 46:38.215
And secondly, we were kids in 1999.

46:38.217 --> 46:40.943
Our kinds of parties were
pin the tail on the donkey

46:40.945 --> 46:42.292
and a pinata.

46:43.516 --> 46:45.735
Well, I still party like that.

46:57.278 --> 47:00.423
I never thought that going
after something I love,

47:00.425 --> 47:02.175
something everyone says impossible,

47:03.048 --> 47:06.028
that that would backfire
me so spectacularly.

47:10.463 --> 47:14.863
I gave everything I had to music. My life.

47:15.935 --> 47:17.898
That's why there was never a plan B.

47:19.035 --> 47:21.772
I had nothing left to give to it.

47:21.774 --> 47:24.357
Why didn't you just come home?

47:26.735 --> 47:27.608
My parents.

47:29.805 --> 47:32.828
They said that if you go,

47:34.685 --> 47:37.995
if you do this, you don't get to go home.

47:40.217 --> 47:41.817
They couldn't have meant that.

47:45.233 --> 47:46.066
Well.

47:47.045 --> 47:51.002
If I ever find them, I'll
be sure to let you know.

47:54.355 --> 47:55.763
Yeah, through the good and bad,

47:55.765 --> 47:57.065
it was always okay though.

47:58.845 --> 48:00.542
And one thing always held true.

48:02.051 --> 48:03.218
What's that?

48:06.582 --> 48:07.558
I'm a nomad.

48:09.315 --> 48:12.568
I have no home, no place where I belong.

48:14.515 --> 48:16.488
Part of me feels like
it's always been that way.

48:19.365 --> 48:21.265
Except for the moments I had with you.

48:28.398 --> 48:30.188
Shall we play a game?

48:32.134 --> 48:34.034
You just war games'd me.

48:38.755 --> 48:40.403
Okay.

48:40.405 --> 48:41.605
Okay, let's play a game.

48:45.905 --> 48:48.030
Where did you get this shit?

48:48.865 --> 48:50.838
It taste like high school gym class.

49:04.395 --> 49:05.745
Are you sure about this?

49:12.355 --> 49:13.188
Okay.

49:14.985 --> 49:15.985
I'll get the beer.

49:28.405 --> 49:29.983
Do you remember that
guy that used to throw

49:29.985 --> 49:31.948
all the parties when we were kids?

49:33.795 --> 49:35.213
Yeah.

49:35.215 --> 49:36.273
Danny?

49:36.275 --> 49:38.913
Danny, yes, oh my god

49:38.915 --> 49:41.113
that kid was crazy.

49:41.115 --> 49:43.203
I remember like getting blackout drunk

49:43.205 --> 49:47.038
was just a physical challenge
for him and he always won.

49:47.040 --> 49:48.096
Whatever happened to him?

49:48.098 --> 49:51.553
I actually saw him a year or two ago.

49:51.555 --> 49:52.655
He lives in Vegas now.

49:53.878 --> 49:56.293
And he manages people's finances.

49:56.295 --> 49:57.303
Danny?

49:57.305 --> 50:00.313
People actually trust
him with their money?

50:00.315 --> 50:01.148
Yes they do.

50:04.155 --> 50:07.283
Well, I remember his
parties being insane.

50:07.285 --> 50:08.608
Never a dull moment.

50:11.496 --> 50:15.253
So, when's the last
time you played this?

50:15.255 --> 50:19.908
Honestly, probably not
since sometime in college.

50:20.978 --> 50:23.418
Oh, so what you're saying
is you're out of practice.

50:25.172 --> 50:26.553
If my memory serves me correctly

50:26.555 --> 50:29.438
I used to kick your ass
without even aiming.

50:30.658 --> 50:31.833
Oh okay.

50:31.835 --> 50:33.933
I can see that you
certainly have the cups,

50:33.935 --> 50:36.315
that's nice, those are nice, oh good.

50:36.317 --> 50:37.728
But more importantly.

50:38.565 --> 50:40.516
Do you have the balls to back that up?

50:40.518 --> 50:41.983
I do.

50:41.985 --> 50:43.728
And my balls are nicer than yours.

50:47.917 --> 50:48.750
Mmm.

50:49.975 --> 50:52.676
Thanks for throwing your balls in my eye.

50:52.678 --> 50:53.675
I appreciate that.

50:55.560 --> 50:56.910
I'm high as a motherfucker.

50:58.498 --> 50:59.438
We should play.

51:01.600 --> 51:03.223
Ugh.

51:03.225 --> 51:04.893
And you still suck.

51:04.895 --> 51:05.728
Unbelievable.

51:07.341 --> 51:09.280
You're like the rainman of Beer Pong.

51:17.261 --> 51:19.473
You know, there's
something very wrong about us

51:19.475 --> 51:20.828
playing this in this room.

51:22.295 --> 51:25.283
It is far too fancy for
the little red cups,

51:25.285 --> 51:27.185
and whatever cheap light beer this is.

51:29.075 --> 51:31.673
Jack, it's a dining room.

51:31.675 --> 51:34.563
Who the hell needs a dining room?

51:34.565 --> 51:35.398
Hmm.

51:36.487 --> 51:37.543
Does Paul feel this strongly against

51:37.545 --> 51:38.711
the use of dining rooms

51:38.875 --> 51:41.923
No, he loves this stupid room.

51:41.925 --> 51:44.238
Perfect for big family gatherings.

51:45.419 --> 51:46.933
Oh, he has a big family?

51:46.935 --> 51:49.073
No, he's an only child.

51:49.075 --> 51:50.738
And his parents live in Arizona.

51:51.605 --> 51:53.943
He sees this vision of our life

51:53.945 --> 51:57.863
and I just don't know
if I feel the same way.

51:57.865 --> 52:00.405
I don't see it the way
he does, I don't think.

52:01.499 --> 52:02.895
How do you see it?

52:02.897 --> 52:04.147
I don't know.

52:05.899 --> 52:07.337
Okay.

52:07.339 --> 52:08.473
How does he see it?

52:08.475 --> 52:11.263
Oh you know, the whole
leave it to beaver thing.

52:11.265 --> 52:13.763
You know, housewife, rugrats.

52:13.765 --> 52:16.238
The home cooked meal when
he gets home from work.

52:17.725 --> 52:19.486
You forgot the glass
of scotch waiting for him

52:19.488 --> 52:21.353
when he came through the front door.

52:21.355 --> 52:23.263
Yeah well, I don't really think

52:23.265 --> 52:25.008
housewife is my style.

52:27.065 --> 52:27.898
No it's not.

52:29.425 --> 52:32.318
Well, we have a more
pressing matter at hand.

52:34.265 --> 52:36.238
I'm not gonna drink this shit anymore.

52:37.681 --> 52:39.218
Because it's gonna make me puke.

52:39.220 --> 52:40.888
Okay, sorry.

52:43.545 --> 52:44.673
Simple solution.

52:44.675 --> 52:47.163
How about we switch back to vodka?

52:47.165 --> 52:48.708
Okay, that sounds good, right?

52:48.744 --> 52:49.577
Sure.

52:50.265 --> 52:53.545
And that rug over there is calling to me

52:55.145 --> 52:58.138
to go and pass out and just relax.

52:59.217 --> 53:00.768
I've had enough of the games.

53:01.878 --> 53:03.628
All right, sounds good.

53:04.655 --> 53:06.355
I can't wait for you to join me.

54:14.776 --> 54:15.858
So you went into marketing.

54:17.035 --> 54:18.348
Just like you always wanted.

54:20.295 --> 54:21.278
Sort of.

54:22.785 --> 54:24.585
Sort of, what do you mean sort of?

54:26.055 --> 54:29.628
Just, I wish I was a
little further along by now.

54:31.742 --> 54:33.513
I did work on one ad campaign though.

54:33.515 --> 54:34.715
Yeah, what was it for?

54:35.585 --> 54:37.793
I don't think you'd know.

54:37.795 --> 54:38.813
Why not?

54:38.815 --> 54:40.178
I got television in my car.

54:42.339 --> 54:43.420
I'm just kidding.

54:43.422 --> 54:44.977
I barely have working FM radio.

54:49.038 --> 54:50.183
No really, what was it?

54:50.185 --> 54:52.198
It's called Volcano Chips.

54:53.155 --> 54:54.763
Hey is that the one with the guy

54:54.765 --> 54:57.438
who's drinking water on
the floor next to the dog?

54:58.625 --> 54:59.553
Yeah.

54:59.555 --> 55:01.199
That is the one.

55:01.201 --> 55:02.201
I loved that song.

55:03.195 --> 55:06.913
That jingle is fantastic, it's so 80s.

55:06.915 --> 55:10.358

55:33.725 --> 55:35.048
So fast.

55:37.545 --> 55:41.133
Oh my god, that was a really
popular commercial, wasn't it?

55:41.135 --> 55:43.173
Yeah, it was.

55:43.175 --> 55:44.173
Wait, if it was so successful,

55:44.175 --> 55:45.725
why didn't you get another one?

55:47.455 --> 55:48.873
Career politics.

55:48.875 --> 55:50.298
Oh, fuck that.

55:51.763 --> 55:53.733
No, I'm writing them a letter.

55:53.735 --> 55:55.688
Several letters and I'm demanding more.

55:57.005 --> 55:58.961
I might even sing for them.

55:58.963 --> 56:01.183
Please, don't do that.

56:01.185 --> 56:02.418
You'll get me fired.

56:03.425 --> 56:05.898
I'm a drummer and
singing is not my forte.

56:07.025 --> 56:08.138
Yeah, but,

56:09.379 --> 56:11.563
it's still cute when you do.

56:11.565 --> 56:14.817
You know, I still have the tape.

56:14.819 --> 56:15.652
No you don't, no.

56:16.563 --> 56:17.453
I do.

56:17.455 --> 56:19.243
Nah, mmm-mmm, impossible.

56:19.245 --> 56:21.238

57:45.356 --> 57:47.216
You know you do.

57:47.218 --> 57:48.818
Paul is one lucky guy.

57:49.955 --> 57:52.342
You know we really don't
have to talk about him.

57:53.715 --> 57:55.798
He's part of your life.

57:57.022 --> 57:57.855
I mean,

58:00.259 --> 58:02.103
look at all this.

58:02.105 --> 58:03.953
He built something I've only dreamt about

58:03.955 --> 58:07.228
and here it is, he has it.

58:08.725 --> 58:10.713
He has you, so

58:10.715 --> 58:11.865
yeah he's pretty lucky.

58:15.145 --> 58:15.978
Well um,

58:17.245 --> 58:19.648
sometimes there's more to life than luck.

58:20.744 --> 58:22.416
I wouldn't know about that.

58:22.418 --> 58:26.021
I haven't been doing too
great in that department

58:26.023 --> 58:28.300
as of late.

58:28.302 --> 58:29.681
Well we found each other.

58:29.683 --> 58:32.502
That's pretty lucky, right?

58:32.504 --> 58:33.523
Yeah.

58:33.525 --> 58:35.008
A little too lucky.

58:36.605 --> 58:38.140
Have you been following me?

58:40.045 --> 58:42.813
Yep, and I have a white
van right outside too

58:42.815 --> 58:43.993
filled with candy.

58:43.995 --> 58:44.826
Wonderful.

58:44.828 --> 58:46.068
My own personal stalker.

58:51.085 --> 58:52.843
Oh, I have an idea.

58:52.845 --> 58:53.678
Come with me.

59:00.062 --> 59:03.881
You're not gonna show me
that white van, are you?

59:12.835 --> 59:15.335
Most of this stuff hasn't
been touched in years.

59:17.755 --> 59:21.693
Paul went through a
little phase in college.

59:21.695 --> 59:23.945
Guess he never really
completely got over it.

59:35.475 --> 59:37.138
I am so sorry.

59:39.295 --> 59:40.268
Jackie!

59:41.785 --> 59:42.618
Wanna play me?

59:44.645 --> 59:46.543
That's kind of an odd request.

59:46.545 --> 59:47.495
I meant pool.

59:50.542 --> 59:51.679
Sure.

59:54.955 --> 59:56.078
Not too shabby.

59:57.339 --> 01:00:00.660
Well, I haven't played since college.

01:00:00.662 --> 01:00:02.959
Oh wait, I didn't go.

01:00:02.961 --> 01:00:04.836
I learned in bars, like real men do.

01:00:06.838 --> 01:00:08.756
All right, we'll get this right here.

01:00:08.758 --> 01:00:09.591
Excuse me.

01:00:12.854 --> 01:00:13.687
Oh shit.

01:00:24.589 --> 01:00:25.888
All right, so pitch me.

01:00:25.890 --> 01:00:28.674
Tell me some commercials, I wanna hear it.

01:00:28.676 --> 01:00:30.473
All right.

01:00:30.475 --> 01:00:32.833
So there's this guy, right?

01:00:32.835 --> 01:00:34.983
And he's having a nightmare.

01:00:34.985 --> 01:00:37.663
And all of his soda cans are empty.

01:00:37.665 --> 01:00:39.123
And he's searching and searching

01:00:39.125 --> 01:00:41.163
and the footage is getting
crazier and crazier

01:00:41.165 --> 01:00:42.533
and then bam!

01:00:42.535 --> 01:00:45.203
He wakes up, all is good,

01:00:45.205 --> 01:00:48.038
he's in his bed, when
his girlfriend walks in.

01:00:49.795 --> 01:00:53.215
She says, "All our soda's missing".

01:00:54.674 --> 01:00:56.873
Okay, all right.

01:00:56.875 --> 01:00:58.235
And?

01:00:58.237 --> 01:00:59.070
And...

01:01:03.195 --> 01:01:04.028
He's like.

01:01:07.435 --> 01:01:08.485
That's really good.

01:01:09.772 --> 01:01:11.754
I don't even like soda that much

01:01:11.756 --> 01:01:13.056
and now I really want one.

01:01:14.058 --> 01:01:16.594
Well I guess that means
I'm doing my job then.

01:01:16.596 --> 01:01:19.846
You know, if they decide to pick it up.

01:01:21.375 --> 01:01:22.856
If not, maybe you should just go around

01:01:22.858 --> 01:01:24.296
to everyone, one by one,

01:01:24.298 --> 01:01:26.152
tell them the pitch.

01:01:26.154 --> 01:01:28.712
And then, once they see
the increase in sales,

01:01:28.714 --> 01:01:30.223
the big wigs that run your firm

01:01:30.225 --> 01:01:31.338
will finally cash in.

01:01:32.935 --> 01:01:34.618

Reach out to companies independently?

01:01:53.635 --> 01:01:55.192
It's not that easy.

01:01:55.194 --> 01:01:56.312
Why not?

01:01:56.314 --> 01:01:57.578
I have a contract.

01:01:59.065 --> 01:02:00.003
Break it.

01:02:00.005 --> 01:02:01.608
And why would I do that?

01:02:02.735 --> 01:02:04.511
Well to be fair,

01:02:04.513 --> 01:02:06.103
sounds like a pretty shitty contract

01:02:06.105 --> 01:02:08.328
if they're not developing
any of your ideas.

01:02:09.590 --> 01:02:10.508
That's a good point.

01:02:11.635 --> 01:02:15.108
Maybe we can write something together.

01:02:15.110 --> 01:02:16.963
You know, change their minds.

01:02:16.965 --> 01:02:18.245
Like what?

01:02:18.247 --> 01:02:19.793

01:02:19.795 --> 01:02:20.768
I mean, why not?

01:02:21.875 --> 01:02:23.003
I'm sure you can write something better

01:02:23.005 --> 01:02:25.082
than Volcano Chips.

01:02:25.084 --> 01:02:27.167

01:03:03.075 --> 01:03:04.474
How was your flight?

01:03:04.476 --> 01:03:05.553
It was good.

01:03:05.555 --> 01:03:06.773

But hey, is he still there?

01:03:31.777 --> 01:03:34.239
I get like this weird
feeling from you that

01:03:34.241 --> 01:03:36.196
you have still some sort
of connection with him

even have an answer,

01:03:49.481 --> 01:03:51.397
that's like the best part, I get it, like.

01:03:51.399 --> 01:03:52.597
I gotta go.

01:03:52.599 --> 01:03:53.935

He's uh,

01:04:38.081 --> 01:04:41.113
god, I just remember sitting
there in that auditorium

01:04:41.115 --> 01:04:42.908
just watching you.

01:04:44.583 --> 01:04:46.013
What are you talking about?

01:04:46.015 --> 01:04:48.263
Oh you know, that
battle of the bands thing

01:04:48.265 --> 01:04:49.098
you guys did.

01:04:50.375 --> 01:04:51.743
Yeah, yeah.

01:04:51.745 --> 01:04:54.268
Everyone else just
drowned out, you know.

01:04:55.404 --> 01:04:57.533
I could just see how much you loved it.

01:04:57.535 --> 01:04:59.353
Right, we were kids.

01:04:59.355 --> 01:05:00.348
It was a battle.

01:05:01.223 --> 01:05:02.803
It was fun.

01:05:02.805 --> 01:05:05.873
Yeah, but, those other guys

01:05:05.875 --> 01:05:07.138
were never gonna last.

01:05:08.898 --> 01:05:09.898
I know, I knew it.

01:05:11.481 --> 01:05:13.258
You play when you can play.

01:05:13.260 --> 01:05:14.778
Yeah, I guess.

01:05:16.895 --> 01:05:19.718
When I didn't hear from you at school,

01:05:21.065 --> 01:05:23.165
I always kind of wished you'd given it up.

01:05:24.945 --> 01:05:25.778
Why?

01:05:28.380 --> 01:05:30.730
'Cause then maybe I
would have still had you.

01:05:35.623 --> 01:05:37.706
Why are you doing this?

01:05:38.985 --> 01:05:40.048
Why am I here?

01:05:43.239 --> 01:05:45.523
I saw you at that park.

01:05:45.525 --> 01:05:48.953
For so many years I wondered,

01:05:48.955 --> 01:05:50.613
what would I say?

01:05:50.615 --> 01:05:52.518
What would I do if I saw you?

01:05:55.205 --> 01:05:57.392
You deserve a second chance.

01:05:59.639 --> 01:06:01.863
A second chance at what?

01:06:01.865 --> 01:06:03.637
You live in a car.

01:06:03.639 --> 01:06:04.472
So what?

01:06:05.719 --> 01:06:07.795
What, a second chance at what?

01:06:07.797 --> 01:06:09.763
Plan B.

01:06:09.765 --> 01:06:12.473
You know, to get your life right again.

01:06:12.475 --> 01:06:13.868
I got my life right.

01:06:15.180 --> 01:06:16.673
You know I might not have this life

01:06:16.675 --> 01:06:17.506
or my own bedroom,

01:06:17.508 --> 01:06:20.215
but at least I went after what I wanted.

01:06:22.359 --> 01:06:24.158
How does it feel to
slowly lose who you are?

01:06:26.335 --> 01:06:28.393
I know who I am.

01:06:28.395 --> 01:06:29.893
Oh yeah?

01:06:29.895 --> 01:06:31.338
What did Paul want?

01:06:31.340 --> 01:06:32.171
He was just calling checking,

01:06:32.173 --> 01:06:34.105
see if you're being a good little wife?

01:06:36.155 --> 01:06:37.363
Yeah you must be really unhappy

01:06:37.365 --> 01:06:39.215
with this perfect real life you have.

01:06:40.055 --> 01:06:41.653
I wanted this.

01:06:41.655 --> 01:06:43.933
I wanted all of this, I
wanted a house, the pool,

01:06:43.935 --> 01:06:45.283
all the fancy toys.

01:06:45.285 --> 01:06:48.703
Is that all you care about,
this superficial bullshit?

01:06:48.705 --> 01:06:49.948
No, I care about you.

01:06:52.063 --> 01:06:53.588
I should have had you.

01:06:54.675 --> 01:06:56.125
We should have been together.

01:06:57.195 --> 01:06:59.858
But I made a choice, a decision.

01:07:02.445 --> 01:07:05.473
I thought it'd bring me
back here, back to you

01:07:05.475 --> 01:07:06.608
but it didn't.

01:07:07.585 --> 01:07:08.578
'Cause I failed.

01:07:10.555 --> 01:07:12.255
My parents knew, they always knew.

01:07:13.095 --> 01:07:15.733
That's why they threw me to the wolves.

01:07:15.735 --> 01:07:16.568
You knew.

01:07:17.695 --> 01:07:20.483
That's how you got here with Paul

01:07:20.485 --> 01:07:22.958
and all this.

01:07:23.805 --> 01:07:26.043
What's so great about this?

01:07:26.045 --> 01:07:28.833
You know at work, I'm fighting and clawing

01:07:28.835 --> 01:07:30.523
just to be heard.

01:07:30.525 --> 01:07:34.323
I even spent years trying to mold myself

01:07:34.325 --> 01:07:37.223
into this person and they
don't even listen to me.

01:07:37.225 --> 01:07:40.713
And Paul, half the time
he's not even here!

01:07:40.715 --> 01:07:42.559
And when he is,

01:07:42.561 --> 01:07:44.858
he doesn't see the real me.

01:07:48.924 --> 01:07:52.415
All this time, I've been
looking for something

01:07:53.885 --> 01:07:55.568
and I thought I found it in him.

01:07:57.375 --> 01:07:58.242
But I didn't.

01:08:05.585 --> 01:08:06.955
I'm not the same guy anymore.

01:08:08.524 --> 01:08:09.774
Not completely.

01:08:13.478 --> 01:08:15.868
This morning, I bathed in a lake.

01:08:17.805 --> 01:08:19.455
I stole food out of the dumpster.

01:08:21.103 --> 01:08:22.752
I can't even afford my own toothpaste.

01:08:26.385 --> 01:08:30.368
My drum and my car,
they're my whole world.

01:08:32.502 --> 01:08:34.578
I lost everything else
'cause I had to be me.

01:08:35.680 --> 01:08:39.919
You don't have to do it alone.

01:08:39.921 --> 01:08:40.997
I am alone.

01:08:40.999 --> 01:08:43.999
Not anymore, you don't have to be.

01:08:47.500 --> 01:08:48.332
No.

01:08:49.654 --> 01:08:51.593
We can't be together.

01:08:51.595 --> 01:08:54.183
How can we be together
knowing what you had to do,

01:08:54.185 --> 01:08:55.535
what you had to go through?

01:08:57.879 --> 01:08:59.629
It's been 10 years.

01:09:00.774 --> 01:09:02.692
I can't lose you again.

01:09:06.156 --> 01:09:07.988
I want to be with you.

01:09:25.741 --> 01:09:26.573
Fuck it.

01:09:51.450 --> 01:09:52.283
Now what?

01:10:02.238 --> 01:10:03.071

Good morning.

01:13:07.675 --> 01:13:08.738
Coffee?

01:13:08.740 --> 01:13:09.573
Oh, yes.

01:13:11.235 --> 01:13:12.066
- Which one?
- I don't care.

01:13:12.068 --> 01:13:13.543
- Okay.
- The fuller one.

01:13:13.545 --> 01:13:15.513
Take the blue pill.

01:13:15.515 --> 01:13:19.093
You know, you should be a housewife.

01:13:19.095 --> 01:13:19.995
You're good at it.

01:13:21.215 --> 01:13:24.283
I could actually get used
to doing this every morning.

01:13:24.285 --> 01:13:26.008
Coffee delivered every morning?

01:13:27.905 --> 01:13:29.373
I'll take it.

01:13:29.375 --> 01:13:30.625
I'll keep that in mind.

01:13:32.185 --> 01:13:34.198
Paul never delivered coffee in bed?

01:13:35.152 --> 01:13:36.165
Are you really gonna talk about him?

01:13:36.167 --> 01:13:37.987
Sorry, sorry.

01:13:37.989 --> 01:13:40.656
I didn't mean to crush the mood.

01:13:43.165 --> 01:13:44.968
Where are we gonna go from here, though?

01:13:47.055 --> 01:13:47.888
Well.

01:13:49.345 --> 01:13:51.003
It looks nice out.

01:13:51.005 --> 01:13:52.773
We can go for a morning swim.

01:13:52.775 --> 01:13:54.043
Excuse me?

01:13:54.045 --> 01:13:54.878
Yeah.

01:13:55.825 --> 01:13:58.125
It's one of my favorite
ways to start the day.

01:13:59.195 --> 01:14:01.333
Just like last night was
one of my favorite ways

01:14:01.335 --> 01:14:04.008
- to end the day.
- You wanna go swimming now.

01:14:04.010 --> 01:14:05.610
Well, that wasn't too bad, yeah.

01:14:07.509 --> 01:14:10.043
But shouldn't we, I mean, we should.

01:14:10.045 --> 01:14:11.495
We'll worry about it later.

01:14:16.035 --> 01:14:17.418
So yes, swimming?

01:14:18.715 --> 01:14:20.468
After this cup of coffee though?

01:14:22.085 --> 01:14:25.018
Well, after last night, I
think coffee's a good idea.

01:14:26.795 --> 01:14:28.990
Actually, you got any crack lying around?

01:14:34.090 --> 01:14:35.673
Come on, come in!

01:14:36.832 --> 01:14:39.027

What do you want me to say?

01:15:31.848 --> 01:15:34.033
I want you to say that you're staying.

01:15:34.035 --> 01:15:37.038
And that we're gonna find
a way to make this work.

01:15:38.395 --> 01:15:39.228
How can I?

01:15:40.888 --> 01:15:42.023
The entire time I was out there

01:15:42.025 --> 01:15:43.443
all I'm thinking is

01:15:43.445 --> 01:15:45.773
I'm invading someone else's world.

01:15:45.775 --> 01:15:46.608
Their life.

01:15:49.652 --> 01:15:50.485
Jesus.

01:15:52.313 --> 01:15:53.363
You have a life here.

01:15:54.470 --> 01:15:56.328
And my fate was decided a long time ago.

01:15:58.555 --> 01:16:00.343
It's hard, and it's definitely not pretty

01:16:00.345 --> 01:16:01.178
but it's mine.

01:16:02.425 --> 01:16:03.625
And I can't forget that.

01:16:08.008 --> 01:16:09.478
I'd still have a life.

01:16:11.110 --> 01:16:13.578
But you'd be in it, it'd be better.

01:16:15.190 --> 01:16:16.023
I can't.

01:16:17.335 --> 01:16:19.223
This isn't our happy ending.

01:16:19.225 --> 01:16:22.098
I want it to be, but, it's just not.

01:16:23.655 --> 01:16:25.322
I don't belong here.

01:16:26.855 --> 01:16:30.538
If we're together, I'm just
gonna tear you down with me.

01:16:32.012 --> 01:16:33.673
We'll end up in that car together.

01:16:33.675 --> 01:16:35.275
But at least we'd be together.

01:16:38.705 --> 01:16:39.538
Call Paul.

01:16:41.314 --> 01:16:43.038
Just tell him, tell him the truth.

01:16:44.114 --> 01:16:45.273
Don't lie.

01:16:45.275 --> 01:16:47.098
Tell him what happened.

01:16:49.195 --> 01:16:51.798
He can give you something I never could.

01:16:57.756 --> 01:17:00.589
I should have never let you go.

01:17:43.295 --> 01:17:45.003
Get out of the car.

01:17:45.005 --> 01:17:46.573
Bridget?

01:17:46.575 --> 01:17:47.703
Get out of the car.

01:17:47.705 --> 01:17:48.955
You at least owe me that.

01:17:56.825 --> 01:17:58.273
Look.

01:17:58.275 --> 01:17:59.475
You were right about me.

01:18:00.505 --> 01:18:01.455
What do you mean?

01:18:03.865 --> 01:18:05.243
I found you.

01:18:05.245 --> 01:18:07.403
I knew you'd be in that park

01:18:07.405 --> 01:18:10.658
and I found you and I followed you there.

01:18:11.915 --> 01:18:14.908
I guess I really was your
own personal stalker.

01:18:16.305 --> 01:18:20.568
I needed to know that you were okay.

01:18:21.785 --> 01:18:23.585
I need to know what happened to you.

01:18:25.200 --> 01:18:26.850
But what I didn't realize is that

01:18:28.176 --> 01:18:29.009
I'm not okay.

01:18:30.038 --> 01:18:31.055
And for so long now

01:18:32.535 --> 01:18:33.988
everything's felt wrong.

01:18:35.045 --> 01:18:36.802
And I didn't know what it was.

01:18:38.059 --> 01:18:39.548
Until last night.

01:18:40.435 --> 01:18:41.768
Til I found you again.

01:18:44.105 --> 01:18:45.348
I made a mistake.

01:18:46.519 --> 01:18:47.818
What are you talking about?

01:18:52.565 --> 01:18:53.398
Here.

01:18:56.075 --> 01:18:57.558
Just know that I was wrong.
