00:02.228 --> 00:03.560
Phil, Carter and CJ are waiting

00:03.562 --> 00:05.395
for their hot chocolates.
What happened?

00:05.397 --> 00:06.488
Couldn't find the whipped cream?

00:06.507 --> 00:09.082
(mouth full):
Oh, I found it, all right.

00:09.251 --> 00:11.585
What did we say
about doing whipped cream shots?

00:11.679 --> 00:13.345
Never leave Kat out!

00:13.497 --> 00:14.972
That's right.

00:17.351 --> 00:19.593
-This is delicious.
-Mm-hmm.

00:19.687 --> 00:21.595
What is going on back here?

00:21.764 --> 00:23.188
BOTH:
Nothing.

00:23.340 --> 00:25.357
This is so inappropriate.

00:25.509 --> 00:27.526
We said we would do this
as a group.

00:28.362 --> 00:29.737
Thank you.

00:31.866 --> 00:35.034
How hard is it to make
two hot choc...?

00:36.353 --> 00:37.611
Oh, man.

00:37.763 --> 00:40.781
I had this exact same fantasy.

00:40.933 --> 00:43.500
But one of you wasn't in it.

an employee meeting.

00:54.113 --> 00:56.371
Yes, a couple hot chocolates

00:56.390 --> 00:58.465
for a couple hot chocolates.

00:58.617 --> 00:59.892
You're corny, Dad.

01:00.043 --> 01:01.301
Ooh.

01:01.620 --> 01:04.379
Cornier than a cornucopia of
cornflakes in an Iowa cornfield?

01:04.398 --> 01:05.472
No?

01:05.599 --> 01:07.624
Guess I'm corny, too.

01:07.643 --> 01:09.684
Just remember, when your mom
comes to pick you up,

01:09.795 --> 01:10.977
you did your homework first.

Looks like someone is
thinking about entering

the jingle contest
at the Middle C.

01:23.250 --> 01:26.660
Oh, no, I'm not ready
for something as prestigious

01:26.754 --> 01:29.737
as a contest sponsored
by Manny's Auto Garage.

01:29.757 --> 01:31.573
He's the Sultan
of Transmissions.

01:31.592 --> 01:33.667
Yo, all I care about is
the extra cash.

01:33.794 --> 01:36.411
Mondays are usually dead,
but this is gonna bring 'em in.

01:36.430 --> 01:39.414
Hey, wouldn't it be great if
Max signed up for the contest?

01:39.433 --> 01:42.684
Don't try to act like you're
just thinking of that now.

01:43.662 --> 01:45.011
No.

If you miss it,
you have to enter!

Damn your athletic genes.

01:53.021 --> 01:54.947
Oh, come on, Kat!

01:55.098 --> 01:57.007
That was my lunch!

01:57.025 --> 01:59.618
I'm particularly proud
of that one.

02:00.512 --> 02:01.936
-(phone chirps)
-Oh.

02:02.030 --> 02:04.681
Looks like your mom's gonna be
a little late picking you up.

02:04.700 --> 02:05.958
Let's go back to the bar.

02:06.127 --> 02:08.352
Ooh, I'll let you scrape gum
from under the tables.

02:08.370 --> 02:10.462
Can I just stay here instead?

02:10.614 --> 02:11.855
By yourself?

02:11.874 --> 02:13.615
Oh, I'll look after him for you.

02:13.709 --> 02:14.967
Okay, uh, cool.

02:15.194 --> 02:16.468
Uh, can I talk to you?

02:16.695 --> 02:18.637

CJ doesn't know about us.

Oh, so you're saying
that I shouldn't tell

02:23.869 --> 02:25.793
your 12-year-old son
that we're having sex?

02:25.813 --> 02:27.663
Oh, what ever
will we talk about?

02:27.723 --> 02:29.148
Listen...

02:29.299 --> 02:31.041
we're gonna have a great time
and you don't have to worry

02:31.059 --> 02:32.985
about violating
any child labor laws.

02:33.212 --> 02:34.987
Now go on, get.

Quick question.

02:36.991 --> 02:39.566
Do you have access
to Max's underpants?

02:39.660 --> 02:41.885
Hey, I am not putting a flyer

I'm not entering
the jingle contest.

02:51.839 --> 02:53.580

02:53.674 --> 02:55.990
Okay, sorry, no more flyers.

02:56.010 --> 02:58.260
Thank you.

02:59.329 --> 03:01.680
Anybody could've done that.

03:02.574 --> 03:03.831
Max, you have to do it.

03:03.926 --> 03:05.851
You are such a good songwriter.

03:06.078 --> 03:07.260
Back in college,
everyone thought

03:07.354 --> 03:08.762
he was gonna be
the next John Mayer.

03:08.914 --> 03:11.106
Is that something people want?

03:12.175 --> 03:14.267
Let me get up out of this.

03:14.361 --> 03:16.177
Kat, thank you for your support,

03:16.346 --> 03:18.530
but I will share my music
with people when I'm ready.

03:18.607 --> 03:20.440
Okay, this might sound
like something

03:20.592 --> 03:23.017
that Randi often refers to
as "shade."

03:23.037 --> 03:24.870
But if you don't
show your work to people,

03:25.021 --> 03:26.613
it's not work, it's a hobby.

03:26.690 --> 03:29.023
Yep, that's shade.

03:29.117 --> 03:31.101
Come on, this contest might be
just the thing

03:31.119 --> 03:32.602
to get
your creative juices flowing.

03:32.696 --> 03:35.789
I promise you my juices
are better than ever.

03:35.883 --> 03:37.941
Okay? Like a fine wine.

03:37.960 --> 03:39.443
Thus, no jingles required.

03:39.461 --> 03:42.128
Or maybe you don't want to enter

03:42.223 --> 03:44.130
because you don't think
you're good enough.

03:44.225 --> 03:46.725
Being that I'm a mature adult,
let me assure you,

03:46.952 --> 03:49.502
I am impervious
to reverse psychology.

03:49.654 --> 03:50.878
Oh, really?

03:50.956 --> 03:53.398
Why do you think you part
your hair on that side?

03:53.567 --> 03:55.475
Because back in college
you said...

03:55.569 --> 03:57.402
(gasps)

03:57.554 --> 03:59.571
You're a witch.

04:00.557 --> 04:02.632
So for this one,
my teacher had us

04:02.651 --> 04:04.651
draw our beds from memory.

04:04.803 --> 04:06.078
That looks like a couch.

04:06.247 --> 04:07.496
You look like a couch!

04:08.398 --> 04:10.474
Sorry, being an adult is hard.

04:10.492 --> 04:12.492
You go through transitions.

04:12.644 --> 04:14.419
Mind your business.

04:14.571 --> 04:15.921
I like your nails.

04:16.072 --> 04:18.906
Oh, thank you,
I did them myself.

04:19.075 --> 04:20.425
Those would've gotten you
an A-plus.

04:20.577 --> 04:22.076
(chuckles)
You want me to do yours?

04:22.096 --> 04:23.095
Oh, that'd be awesome.

04:23.322 --> 04:24.429
It's gonna cost you though.

04:24.656 --> 04:26.840
I don't have any money,
but I can give you

04:26.992 --> 04:28.082
a shout-out on my Insta.

04:28.269 --> 04:31.828
Thanks, but all I need is
two embarrassing stories

04:31.921 --> 04:34.347
about your dad--
one for each hand.

04:35.517 --> 04:39.002
Y'all are never gonna believe
what just happened.

04:39.021 --> 04:41.688
Prepare yourself
for some big news!

04:41.765 --> 04:43.615
You're getting your eyes done.

04:43.767 --> 04:46.809
Sheila, I asked you
about that in confidence.

04:47.771 --> 04:51.439
Carter has asked me to emcee
the jingle competition.

04:51.517 --> 04:54.684
Which I shall
henceforth be calling

04:54.778 --> 04:56.944
"Manny's One Night Only

05:01.543 --> 05:02.876

05:02.970 --> 05:04.377
Congratulations.

05:04.546 --> 05:06.863
Yeah, Carter couldn't have made
a better choice.

05:06.956 --> 05:08.698
Well, I'd like to be humble,

05:08.717 --> 05:10.809
but I have to agree.

05:10.960 --> 05:12.227
(chuckles)

05:13.963 --> 05:15.630
"He couldn't have made
a better choice"?

05:15.649 --> 05:17.040
Seriously, Katharine,

05:17.133 --> 05:20.043
have you forgotten that stretch
in the '80s when I was

05:20.136 --> 05:23.547
the face of Consolidated
Farm Machinery?

05:24.716 --> 05:27.400
No, the image of you in a
swimsuit draped across the hood

05:27.494 --> 05:30.311
of a manure spreader is seared
in my memory.

05:30.998 --> 05:32.664
Of course I'm happy for Phil.

05:32.891 --> 05:35.334
I'm sure he'll do
a perfectly adequate job.

05:35.485 --> 05:37.669
Aw, that's what you said to me

05:37.821 --> 05:40.730
when I got my teaching degree.

05:40.749 --> 05:42.082
Hey, CJ, grab your stuff.

05:42.234 --> 05:44.250
Your mom's double parked
on the corner.

05:44.403 --> 05:46.345
All right, I'll see you later.

05:46.496 --> 05:48.496

You two should go out.

05:52.427 --> 05:53.835
What? Randi?

05:53.929 --> 05:55.595
Oh, yeah, she's, uh,
like my brother.

05:55.747 --> 05:58.190
Or my sister or any other person
I'm related to

05:58.341 --> 06:00.007
that I would not go out with.

06:00.102 --> 06:01.418
Did you guys have fun?

06:01.436 --> 06:03.420
Definitely. Check out my nails.

All right, hey,
don't keep your mom waiting.

06:08.110 --> 06:09.926
-Talk to you later.
I love you so much.
-All right, I love you.

06:10.095 --> 06:11.185
Aw!

06:11.279 --> 06:13.020
-He's such a good kid.
-Mm-hmm.

06:13.040 --> 06:14.373
Yeah, he is.

06:14.524 --> 06:16.541
Listen, uh,
don't paint his nails again.

06:16.693 --> 06:18.101
What? Why?

06:18.120 --> 06:19.285
Nail polish is for girls.

06:19.380 --> 06:21.605
Well, that's very close-minded.

06:22.866 --> 06:24.124

06:24.200 --> 06:25.366
It's not how I was brought up.

06:25.386 --> 06:27.611

paint their nails.

None of them are my son. Look,

08:05.727 --> 08:07.711
It also got in my head a little.

08:07.713 --> 08:09.546

bat mitzvah.

08:43.190 --> 08:45.415

08:45.433 --> 08:47.917
No, not me, Max.

aren't you?

08:53.516 --> 08:55.984
Is two the only
even prime number?

08:56.778 --> 08:59.445
Yes, of course I'm entering him.

08:59.598 --> 09:00.947
(giggling)

09:01.041 --> 09:04.000
Stop giggling
when I say I'm entering him.

09:04.878 --> 09:07.212
A child. I work with a child.

09:12.535 --> 09:14.886
Yeah!

09:14.963 --> 09:17.130
-(gunfire on TV)
-Oh, Randi.

09:17.282 --> 09:19.040
I didn't realize you
were up here.

09:19.134 --> 09:20.875
I never use the café bathroom.

09:20.969 --> 09:22.635
It's warm from other people.

09:22.788 --> 09:25.713
Oh, I just do the hover--
it's good for the quads.

09:25.732 --> 09:28.141
I-I needed a break.

09:28.293 --> 09:29.234
I'm mad at Carter.

09:29.385 --> 09:31.236
We're all just sick about it.

09:31.387 --> 09:35.949
None of us expected Carter
to choose Phil as emcee.

09:37.060 --> 09:39.578
Let's just be the bigger person
and pray

09:39.729 --> 09:41.821
that Phil falls on his ass.

09:41.973 --> 09:44.082
Uh, doesn't fall on his ass.

09:44.159 --> 09:45.667
What did I say?

09:46.494 --> 09:47.902
Not important.

09:47.921 --> 09:50.330
I'm actually mad at Carter
for something else.

09:50.424 --> 09:52.165
Oh, right.
The nail polish thing.

09:52.259 --> 09:54.241
-Mm.
-Wait, how did you hear
about it?

09:54.336 --> 09:56.653
Kat told Phil. Phil texted me.

09:56.671 --> 09:58.096
It's a little deal we have.

09:58.323 --> 09:59.413
He also tells me

09:59.507 --> 10:01.749
which of my friends' husbands
are closeted.

10:02.585 --> 10:07.105
I just-- I didn't expect Carter
to be such a caveman about it.

10:07.256 --> 10:09.682
"Me Carter. Fire hot.

10:09.835 --> 10:12.352
Nail polish on boy bad."

10:12.504 --> 10:15.113
You're being awfully hard
on him.

10:15.340 --> 10:18.933
I mean, we all agree
he's horrible at picking emcees.

10:19.027 --> 10:21.936
But, you know,
when it comes to his son,

10:22.030 --> 10:24.197
he's just doing
what he thinks is right.

10:24.349 --> 10:26.625
I can't believe
you're defending him.

10:26.852 --> 10:28.201
Honey,

10:28.353 --> 10:31.112
sometimes it takes people
a while to come around.

10:31.131 --> 10:34.524
It was hard for me to accept
that any unmarried woman

10:34.617 --> 10:36.860
over the age of 30
shouldn't be referred to

10:36.878 --> 10:38.361
as an old maid or a spinster.

10:38.380 --> 10:41.765
And it was a big day for all
of us when you finally did.

10:42.643 --> 10:44.125
I'm just saying that,

10:44.144 --> 10:47.145
you know, if I can change
my way of thinking at my age,

10:47.372 --> 10:49.539
surely Carter can as well.

10:49.632 --> 10:51.608
I hope so.

10:52.802 --> 10:53.818
Love to continue chitchatting,

10:53.987 --> 10:56.470
but I did come up here
for a reason.

10:56.548 --> 10:57.697
Ooh!

11:03.479 --> 11:04.311
Don't worry.

11:04.331 --> 11:05.889
-Randi's at class.
-Oh.

11:05.907 --> 11:07.832
Good. 'Cause I am not
in the mood

11:07.984 --> 11:09.334
for another one of her lectures.

11:09.561 --> 11:10.484
Yeah.

11:10.578 --> 11:13.746
I heard all about
Nail Polish-gate.

11:13.899 --> 11:15.415
How'd you hear about it?

11:15.567 --> 11:17.734
Well, Randi told Kat.
Kat told me.

11:17.827 --> 11:18.659
It's a little deal we have.

11:18.679 --> 11:20.512
Sheila's in the loop, too.

11:20.739 --> 11:23.256
Come on, Phil. You know
I got love for everyone.

11:23.408 --> 11:26.184
Uh, hey, I'm just old-school.
I'm from Louisville.

11:26.353 --> 11:28.687
My father didn't paint his
nails. I don't paint my nails.

11:28.838 --> 11:30.246
It's not what boys do.

11:30.265 --> 11:31.856
I know.
I grew up around here, too.

11:32.025 --> 11:33.416
I was taught the same things.

11:33.435 --> 11:34.693
I was just looking out for CJ

11:34.920 --> 11:36.177
the way my father
looked out for me.

11:36.196 --> 11:38.846
Yeah. Well,
maybe if little straight boys

11:38.865 --> 11:42.108
could paint their nails
without it meaning so dang much,

11:42.260 --> 11:46.121
school would've been
a lot easier for kids like me.

11:47.265 --> 11:48.856
Yeah, never thought about it
that way.

11:48.875 --> 11:51.434
'Cause you didn't have to.

11:51.527 --> 11:52.526
I mean,

11:52.546 --> 11:54.212
I guess
it wasn't a big deal to CJ.

11:54.439 --> 11:57.966
So maybe don't make it
a big deal for you.

11:59.127 --> 12:00.276
You're right.

12:00.295 --> 12:01.386
These are my hang-ups,

12:01.613 --> 12:03.537
and I don't want
to put 'em on my son.

12:03.631 --> 12:04.781
Cut yourself some slack.

12:04.874 --> 12:06.725
The world is changing so fast.

12:06.801 --> 12:07.967
It's hard to keep up.

12:08.136 --> 12:09.210
Damn, Phil.

12:09.229 --> 12:10.453
Why couldn't I have talked
to you

12:10.472 --> 12:12.046
before I got into it with Randi?

12:12.065 --> 12:14.691
Well, I cannot be everywhere.

12:17.295 --> 12:19.386
Welcome
to Manny's One Night Only

12:19.406 --> 12:21.740
Commercial Jingle Showcase
Extravaganza!

12:21.967 --> 12:24.409
Hosted by yours truly,
Phil Crumpler.

12:24.636 --> 12:26.411
(cheering and applause)

12:27.581 --> 12:30.081
Everyone say hello
to our sponsor and judge, Manny!

12:30.308 --> 12:32.825
(cheering and applause)

12:32.978 --> 12:34.735
Please don't buy him a drink.

12:34.755 --> 12:36.329
Given the lawsuits,
he's not allowed

12:36.423 --> 12:38.256
to consume alcohol in public.

12:38.483 --> 12:40.817
But for everyone else,
a two-drink minimum.

12:40.910 --> 12:42.743
-(chuckles) Please.
-(giggling)

12:42.763 --> 12:44.912
All right, let's get started!

12:45.006 --> 12:47.323
Can we talk about that outfit?

12:47.342 --> 12:50.751
Does he have to pull focus
like that?

12:52.330 --> 12:57.016
Yeah, I guess, uh, some people
just need a<i> lot</i> of attention.

12:57.110 --> 13:00.837
Damn, Sheila. I'm not even
wearing my good bra tonight.

13:01.523 --> 13:05.691
If Phil melts under the pressure
of his hosting responsibilities,

13:05.844 --> 13:07.285
I can slide right in.

13:07.436 --> 13:09.679
But-- fingers crossed-- he does.

13:09.697 --> 13:10.771
You mean "doesn't"?

13:10.865 --> 13:12.773
What did I say?

13:12.867 --> 13:14.684
-(applause)

Please continue.

16:02.854 --> 16:04.128

16:04.355 --> 16:08.615
if I could do our nail polish
conversation over again,

16:08.710 --> 16:10.543
I would do it differently.

16:10.695 --> 16:12.619
I appreciate that.

16:12.639 --> 16:13.863
What made you change your mind?

16:13.881 --> 16:15.807
I had a minute to think.

16:16.034 --> 16:19.143
Also, Phil helped me realize
I have a blind spot.

16:19.262 --> 16:23.481
That man holds some big wisdom
in that little bitty body.

16:24.892 --> 16:27.301
Bottom line is...

16:27.320 --> 16:28.711
I'm sorry.

16:28.804 --> 16:30.989
You're the last person
in the world I want to make mad.

16:31.216 --> 16:34.158
Mmm, I like when a man
isn't afraid to admit

16:34.310 --> 16:35.976
-when he's wrong.
-(chuckles)

16:36.054 --> 16:37.644
-(chuckles)
-Now it's your turn.

16:37.739 --> 16:39.146
Wait, come again?

16:39.833 --> 16:42.225
You shouldn't have called me
closed-minded and stupid.

16:42.243 --> 16:44.744
W-- No, no, no.
I did not call you stupid.

16:44.896 --> 16:46.320
I said you were raised stupid.

16:46.339 --> 16:48.322
You want to call my mom
and tell her that?

16:48.341 --> 16:50.399
No, I do not.
I saw pictures of her,

16:50.418 --> 16:52.251
and she got Michelle Obama arms.

16:52.345 --> 16:53.569
Mm-hmm.

16:53.588 --> 16:55.254
But, okay, I hear you.

16:55.331 --> 16:57.240
Maybe I did jump on you
a little bit.

16:57.333 --> 17:00.226
I've seen a lion be more gentle
with a gazelle.

17:01.262 --> 17:03.913
Look,
we're gonna fight sometimes,

17:03.931 --> 17:06.024
so we should have a few rules.

17:06.175 --> 17:08.543
Okay. Rule number one:

17:08.545 --> 17:09.676
no name-calling.

17:09.771 --> 17:11.029
-See? I listen.
-Mm-hmm.

17:11.180 --> 17:13.847
That's good, 'cause
rule number two is listening.

17:13.941 --> 17:17.426
Okay. Rule number three is never
eat ice cream before church

17:17.445 --> 17:18.778
if you're lactose intolerant.

17:18.854 --> 17:20.020

18:44.031 --> 18:45.772
So, this is where
the beer lives.

18:45.792 --> 18:47.350
Nice.
(chuckles softly)

18:47.443 --> 18:49.776
Does the, uh,
tequila live down here, too?

18:49.796 --> 18:51.036
Oh, there it is.
<i> ¡Hola!</i>

18:51.189 --> 18:53.022
<i> ¿Cómo están ustedes?</i>

18:53.040 --> 18:54.707
What do you want, Kat?

18:55.526 --> 18:57.451
I just-- I want to make sure
you're okay.

18:57.470 --> 18:58.469
I'm fine.

18:59.288 --> 19:02.140
I have never said that
and meant it. (chuckles)

19:03.034 --> 19:04.367
Look, I know you didn't win,

19:04.385 --> 19:06.051
but I still think it's great
you got back up there.

19:06.204 --> 19:07.328
I-I do, too.

19:07.463 --> 19:09.889
It was great performing
something I wrote again.

19:10.041 --> 19:11.983
-And no one threw fruit.
-(chuckling)

19:12.134 --> 19:13.800
So you're not upset?

19:13.895 --> 19:14.819
Oh, I'm upset.

19:15.046 --> 19:16.379
-At me?
-At you.

19:16.472 --> 19:17.989
Why did I ask?

19:18.883 --> 19:20.883
Look, I know you didn't want
to enter the contest,

19:20.902 --> 19:23.327
but I just really want you
to get back to your music.

19:23.554 --> 19:24.996
Listen,

19:25.223 --> 19:26.555
I want that, too.

19:26.741 --> 19:29.742
But you got to trust me to get
there myself, at my own pace.

19:29.894 --> 19:31.577
But what if your pace
is too slow?

19:31.729 --> 19:32.670
You say nothing.

19:32.821 --> 19:34.580
Got it. But what if it's...

19:34.732 --> 19:36.507
Nothing.

19:37.510 --> 19:38.676
You have my word.

19:39.420 --> 19:41.387
-That I will try.
-(laughs)

19:42.998 --> 19:44.331
And one more thing.

19:44.350 --> 19:46.058
What?

19:46.928 --> 19:48.436
Thank you for believing in me.

19:52.250 --> 19:53.524
Hey, Kat,
we're gonna need you out here.

19:53.751 --> 19:56.360
Your mom's onstage,
and she has Phil in a headlock.

19:56.529 --> 19:58.196
Oh, geez.

20:04.186 --> 20:05.036
Thank you
for bringing us dinner.

20:05.229 --> 20:06.445
This is really nice.

20:06.597 --> 20:08.280
Uh-huh, uh-huh.
You gonna eat your sandwich?

20:08.433 --> 20:10.433
Um, I will. Working on my fries.

20:10.451 --> 20:12.043
Never mind the fries--
eat the sandwich.

20:12.194 --> 20:13.786
I'll get there.

20:13.880 --> 20:15.271
Oh, hey, Randi, uh,

20:15.289 --> 20:17.957
could I<i> hand</i> you a napkin?

20:18.109 --> 20:19.275
-I'm good.
-Oh, okay.

20:19.368 --> 20:22.111
How 'bout a, uh, chicken<i> finger?</i>

20:22.129 --> 20:23.446
No, I'm okay.

20:23.464 --> 20:24.280
Good God, woman,

20:24.298 --> 20:26.182
just look at my damn hands!

20:26.801 --> 20:28.893
Black fingernails?

20:29.044 --> 20:31.454
What did you do,
get 'em stuck in a car door?

20:31.472 --> 20:32.212
He let me do it.

20:32.232 --> 20:34.957
It's called Midnight Onyx.

20:34.959 --> 20:36.049
It's 2022.

20:36.069 --> 20:37.551
-Men can paint their nails.
-Mmm.

20:37.570 --> 20:40.238
Well, it looks like men need
a little more practice.

20:40.389 --> 20:42.815
No, it's not my fault.
He wouldn't stop wiggling.

20:42.967 --> 20:44.242
-(chuckles)
-Hey, Kat,

20:44.469 --> 20:45.910
I couldn't help but notice
you're done with your fries.

20:46.061 --> 20:47.470
Maybe you should move on
to your sandwich?

20:47.472 --> 20:49.655
Uh, I think
I might save it for later.

20:49.807 --> 20:50.823
Good God, woman,

20:50.917 --> 20:52.566
just eat the damn sandwich!

20:52.643 --> 20:54.310
Okay, okay.

20:54.312 --> 20:55.995
None of this is going
the way we planned.

20:56.089 --> 20:57.904
It was so much smoother
in our heads.

20:57.924 --> 20:59.298
(chuckles)

21:00.001 --> 21:01.676
What's this?

21:03.170 --> 21:05.746
"A night of original songs

21:05.840 --> 21:07.914
by Max Kingbird"? Really?

21:08.009 --> 21:09.267
Felt like it was time.

21:09.418 --> 21:11.585
Well, you know
how I feel about it.

21:11.604 --> 21:13.920
Randi, fruit me.

21:13.998 --> 21:15.273
-Y-- Kat.
