WEBVTT

00:13.847 --> 00:18.018
As you know, they've been rivals
for over three years.

00:18.143 --> 00:20.478
Cheol-wang Cho Family.
First boss, Cheol-wang Cho.

00:20.603 --> 00:21.563
57 years old.

00:21.688 --> 00:25.734
His family is one of the oldest ones
and he's a smart-ass.

00:26.151 --> 00:29.362
Hey, there's a thing called loyalty
when it comes to family.

00:29.487 --> 00:30.989
You shouldn't have done that.

00:31.114 --> 00:32.741
It's a small world.

00:32.866 --> 00:34.159
But you decided to betray us?

00:34.284 --> 00:36.369
A man lives by loyalty.

00:41.207 --> 00:44.085
And his rival is Mr. Mex,
the first boss of the Mexico Family.

00:44.210 --> 00:45.295
52 years old.

00:45.420 --> 00:48.131
He's slow but brilliant.
He's an evil man.

00:48.256 --> 00:49.591
Their family has been rising quickly,

00:49.716 --> 00:51.426
rapidly expanding their business.

00:51.551 --> 00:53.678
Knock on the door before you come in.

00:54.054 --> 00:55.138
Stand up.

00:58.308 --> 01:00.310
What are you doing, bro?

01:00.435 --> 01:04.230
He must've wanted to end his life.
He's been spying on us.

01:04.355 --> 01:06.691
I need to discipline my kids.

01:06.816 --> 01:09.861
I don't like your ugly face,
but I end up seeing it so often.

01:09.986 --> 01:11.488
Let's stay out of each other's business.

01:11.613 --> 01:15.950
Is that why you opened your shop
in my area?

01:18.161 --> 01:19.704
Did you say "your area"?

01:19.829 --> 01:21.664
There's no such thing.

01:22.791 --> 01:24.042
Lastly, these people...

01:24.167 --> 01:26.336
Recently, the Mexico Family has been
trying to expand their influence.

01:26.461 --> 01:28.046
So, they hired these rookies.

01:28.171 --> 01:30.131
We haven't been able
to collect any data yet,

01:30.256 --> 01:32.342
so our investigation
has reached a dead end.

01:32.467 --> 01:34.636
Watch your back, kid.

01:34.761 --> 01:38.348
There's no use recruiting
those rookies for your protection.

01:45.313 --> 01:47.190
Don't be such a scaredy-cat.

01:47.565 --> 01:50.068
The two rivals are fighting
like cats and dogs.

01:50.193 --> 01:51.528
If we find out the truth,

01:51.653 --> 01:54.114
we can punish them.

01:55.073 --> 01:57.117
So, one of the two is...

01:57.242 --> 01:59.577
not buying our chickens!

01:59.702 --> 02:00.829
Yes.

02:00.954 --> 02:04.749
Korea Poultry Association is searching
for shops that don't buy their chickens.

02:04.874 --> 02:06.167
Do you know that?

02:06.501 --> 02:08.670
I can give them a clue.

02:08.795 --> 02:12.507
I smell something nasty
coming from your shop.

02:12.882 --> 02:14.050
Do you have proof?

02:14.384 --> 02:16.344
You can't win without proof.

02:16.469 --> 02:21.599
Now that you've gotten older,
have you forgotten what respect is?

02:25.520 --> 02:27.564
You're 57 and I'm 52.

02:28.106 --> 02:30.483
We're both getting older.
I'm not calling you "bro" any longer.

02:32.485 --> 02:35.321
THE WORLD THAT TWO MEN
IN THEIR 50s DREAMED OF...

02:35.822 --> 02:38.366
YOUR 50'S

02:45.248 --> 02:47.041
No particular information yet.

02:48.001 --> 02:50.420
They're much bigger,

02:50.545 --> 02:52.297
much better than we thought.

02:52.422 --> 02:55.383
They're not domestic chickens.

02:55.758 --> 02:58.845
I smell something nasty.

02:59.345 --> 03:00.680
I'll keep my eyes on them.

03:00.805 --> 03:02.557
Mr. Mex is not a pushover.

03:02.682 --> 03:05.143
In order to dig up information,

03:05.268 --> 03:07.979
you'll have to become one of his men.

03:08.438 --> 03:10.106
It won't be easy.

03:11.149 --> 03:11.983
Okay.

03:13.735 --> 03:18.698
Remember who raised you.

03:21.075 --> 03:23.453
What the hell are you doing here?

03:25.079 --> 03:26.748
I told you to bring in the laundry,

03:26.873 --> 03:29.125
and you spent all day in your suits
screwing around?

03:29.918 --> 03:32.170
I'm bringing it in right now.

03:33.129 --> 03:34.964
What's with that funny accent?

03:35.089 --> 03:39.135
I'm getting it.

03:47.143 --> 03:50.521
MEX CHICKEN

03:54.234 --> 03:56.110
Welcome to Mex Chicken!

03:56.236 --> 03:57.695
-How many?
-Two.

03:57.820 --> 03:58.821
This way, please.

04:01.866 --> 04:04.827
In order to dig up information,

04:04.953 --> 04:07.038
you'll have to become one of his men.

04:07.163 --> 04:09.540
No, I must keep my pride.

04:09.666 --> 04:12.293
I refuse to say the shop's name!
I'll never say it!

04:14.003 --> 04:16.714
Welcome to Meh...

04:19.926 --> 04:23.054
-Excuse me!
-Yes, sir!

04:26.933 --> 04:28.893
Hello, this is Meh Chicken.

04:29.018 --> 04:30.645
Okay, lots of radishes.

04:30.770 --> 04:32.480
All right.

04:33.982 --> 04:36.276
Welcome to Meh Chicken.

04:57.547 --> 04:58.548
Chicken delivery.

05:36.794 --> 05:37.754
Welcome.

05:41.966 --> 05:44.052
No customers. None.

05:53.853 --> 05:55.188
Thank you.

05:57.482 --> 05:58.483
I gave you a bonus.

06:03.613 --> 06:05.073
Welcome to Mex Chicken!

06:05.573 --> 06:07.366
Right this way! Welcome!

06:07.492 --> 06:09.744
Mex Chicken has
the best chicken in the world!

06:11.996 --> 06:13.873
You must be tired.

06:13.998 --> 06:17.293
Let's go! Keep up your strength, guys!

06:21.297 --> 06:23.007
MEX CHICKEN USES
ONLY DOMESTIC CHICKENS

06:31.849 --> 06:34.685
They're not domestic chickens.

06:43.277 --> 06:44.403
Boss, do we have chickens now?

06:44.904 --> 06:48.324
Yeah. I'll check them. You may go.

06:48.449 --> 06:50.868
-What?
-Didn't you hear me?

06:51.702 --> 06:52.620
Get out!

06:53.955 --> 06:57.291
-He won't trust me, no matter what.
-I told you so.

06:57.416 --> 07:00.545
He is not a pushover.

07:00.670 --> 07:03.840
I did my best. I can't do it anymore.

07:03.965 --> 07:05.133
He won't give me any information.

07:05.258 --> 07:08.261
Now, we have only one option left.

07:09.512 --> 07:14.308
-You mean...
-Yes, I'll handle it.

07:15.768 --> 07:18.271
No, you shouldn't.

07:20.314 --> 07:24.235
It's me. I want to end it now.
Take care of business.

07:27.697 --> 07:28.906
Yes, boss.

07:34.579 --> 07:38.541
Are you really going to do it?
What about me? What am I to you, Dad?

07:40.418 --> 07:43.379
It is time to end it.

07:57.852 --> 08:00.188
You two must be really crazy.

08:00.313 --> 08:01.939
You're not watching the shop.

08:03.649 --> 08:05.568
Drinking in the middle of the day?

08:09.655 --> 08:11.324
-Hey--
-Dad asked me to drink.

08:11.449 --> 08:14.619
-It was Dad, I swear!
-No, it was him!

08:25.796 --> 08:27.423
It must be him.

08:28.257 --> 08:30.259
I didn't think he'd do it.

08:30.384 --> 08:32.178
Boss, what do we do now?

08:32.303 --> 08:33.638
There's only one thing to do.

08:33.763 --> 08:35.264
I'll have to go back to school.

08:36.516 --> 08:38.476
Boss, you can't go back there!

08:38.601 --> 08:41.312
Why? You want to go instead?

08:43.272 --> 08:44.315
I'll go.

08:46.067 --> 08:48.152
Do you even know what you're saying?

08:48.277 --> 08:49.654
Everything is on me.

08:49.779 --> 08:51.364
You're the one who knows nothing.

08:52.156 --> 08:53.991
No, I'll go.

08:54.116 --> 08:56.327
I'm going, boss!

08:57.787 --> 08:58.913
Please let me.

09:00.748 --> 09:06.003
Okay, I promise I'll take care of you
when you come back.

09:10.841 --> 09:11.926
CUSTOMER MESSAGE BOARD

09:12.051 --> 09:13.302
MEX CHICKEN TAKES ADVANTAGE
OF CUSTOMERS

09:13.427 --> 09:14.470
I'll take care of it.

09:20.726 --> 09:22.520
CHO'S CHICKEN

09:22.645 --> 09:25.856
MEX CHICKEN TAKES ADVANTAGE
OF CUSTOMERS

09:29.277 --> 09:31.779
The customer is king!

09:31.904 --> 09:32.863
CUSTOMER SERVICE TRAINING

09:32.989 --> 09:35.032
Too soft! Louder!

09:35.157 --> 09:38.828
The customer is king!

09:38.953 --> 09:40.204
Trainee 2, your voice is too soft!

09:40.329 --> 09:44.584
-On the ground!
-Trainee 2, getting on the ground!

09:45.001 --> 09:46.002
One more time, louder!

09:46.127 --> 09:47.128
The customer is king!

09:47.253 --> 09:48.754
Welcome!

09:48.879 --> 09:50.464
Bend your back more!

09:50.840 --> 09:52.675
The customer... is king!

09:53.467 --> 09:57.138
-The customer is--
-On your back! On your stomach!

09:59.307 --> 10:00.933
Trainee 2, get him up!

10:01.058 --> 10:02.059
I'm sorry!

10:06.355 --> 10:07.815
Lean on me.

10:14.864 --> 10:16.490
What a great day!

10:20.119 --> 10:21.203
Good job, boss!

10:32.340 --> 10:33.466
Boss.

10:34.634 --> 10:36.677
Good job. Come with me.

10:37.219 --> 10:38.679
We need to go somewhere.

10:46.771 --> 10:47.813
Where are we going?

10:48.147 --> 10:51.525
Tonight, we have a chicken delivery
from China.

10:51.651 --> 10:55.613
From China? Then, those chickens...

10:56.030 --> 10:59.283
I promised you
I'd offer you an important position.

10:59.408 --> 11:01.994
You'll be in charge of chicken deals.

11:03.454 --> 11:05.915
-You don't like it?
-No, I do, boss.

11:06.290 --> 11:08.417
I've been doing business
with them for a while,

11:09.418 --> 11:12.046
but this is the first time
their boss will be there, too.

11:13.130 --> 11:16.133
-Go for it.
-Okay.

11:24.016 --> 11:24.975
They're here!

11:26.310 --> 11:27.186
They're here!

11:27.311 --> 11:29.230
-Go get the cameras and radios.
-Yes, sir.

11:34.693 --> 11:38.989
Mr. Mex... you're done.

12:07.101 --> 12:08.227
Where's the president?

12:10.020 --> 12:11.730
He said he'll be here soon.

12:13.899 --> 12:15.401
Show me the merchandise.

12:27.329 --> 12:30.833
How do we know if it's good?
Cut it open.

12:56.275 --> 12:59.028
It's good. Is the president
going to be late?

13:01.280 --> 13:04.867
Crap, why isn't Dad here yet?
He should be here by now.

13:26.263 --> 13:29.266
Our boss doesn't like to draw attention.
Please keep things quiet.

13:29.391 --> 13:30.434
Okay.

13:36.273 --> 13:38.484
Don't look around!

13:39.276 --> 13:40.653
Everyone will notice we're from Yanji.

13:40.778 --> 13:42.863
We must act naturally.
Don't you know that?

13:45.449 --> 13:48.327
The president is here.
He's going to meet with you.

13:48.702 --> 13:49.662
President.

13:52.081 --> 13:55.417
What kind of joke is this, bro?

13:55.543 --> 13:56.877
How did you know about this place?

13:57.002 --> 13:59.588
Dad, why did you come by yourself?
Where are your men?

13:59.713 --> 14:01.966
What? "Dad"?

14:03.884 --> 14:06.554
This guy is a spy. Get him!

14:06.679 --> 14:08.389
Dad!

14:10.182 --> 14:14.353
Those guys left before me.
What's taking them so long?

14:16.105 --> 14:20.109
-Dad!
-What? Why are you calling me "Dad"?

14:20.818 --> 14:22.278
Let's close the deal now.

14:22.862 --> 14:25.155
The deal? Are you kidding me?

14:25.281 --> 14:27.575
So, the chickens we've bought until now...

14:28.409 --> 14:32.413
Cheol-wan Cho,
were you the one behind the deals?

14:32.913 --> 14:36.166
Why is he calling me "Cheol-wang Cho"?

14:36.584 --> 14:38.502
Do you think you're better than me
because I'm from Yanji?

14:38.627 --> 14:42.214
Dad, if you're gonna put on a show,
do a better job of it! Look at your hair!

14:42.339 --> 14:45.426
I have no kids!
Why do you keep calling me "Dad"?

14:45.968 --> 14:48.137
I've never been married!

14:50.139 --> 14:53.100
What's going on here?

14:53.225 --> 14:54.643
Who are they?

14:58.022 --> 15:01.734
Mr. Cheol-wang Cho?
What are you doing here?

15:02.651 --> 15:05.279
-Where's the president?
-What is he talking about?

15:05.404 --> 15:07.364
I'm the president.

15:07.489 --> 15:10.159
This is why I don't want to deal
with South Koreans!

15:10.284 --> 15:11.577
They think they're better than us!

15:11.702 --> 15:15.205
Then, Mr. Cheol-wang Cho, did you
supply chickens to Mex Chicken?

15:15.331 --> 15:17.041
Who the hell is Cheol-wang Cho?

15:18.459 --> 15:21.253
Bring him here. I'll shoot him.

15:21.378 --> 15:25.049
Are you making fun of us?
Why are you pretending to be Chinese?

15:25.466 --> 15:28.218
I'm suspending sales to both shops!

15:29.970 --> 15:32.056
Ah, I'm going nuts!

15:33.307 --> 15:34.850
What are you doing?

15:36.644 --> 15:37.645
What's going on?

15:40.314 --> 15:43.651
I bet they just got caught making the deal
and are in big trouble.

15:49.114 --> 15:50.866
Bro, what's all this about?

15:51.909 --> 15:53.369
Is this some kind of joke?

15:53.494 --> 15:55.120
-What's going on?
-I can't take this anymore!

15:55.245 --> 15:56.830
What is all this?

15:56.956 --> 16:00.793
-Cheol-wang, why are you doing this?
-Hey, what is this about?

16:00.918 --> 16:04.296
No more business with South Korea!

16:04.421 --> 16:10.010
Let go! Let go of me!

16:10.135 --> 16:15.057
WHO ARE YOU?

16:21.438 --> 16:23.816
I'm going to the bathroom.

16:24.566 --> 16:27.236
South Korea seems dangerous.
Should I go with you?

16:28.237 --> 16:30.572
I have a rifle right here. A rifle.

16:41.458 --> 16:42.292
What the hell?

16:45.004 --> 16:47.589
-Are you ignoring me?
-What?

16:47.715 --> 16:48.549
Who are you?

16:50.259 --> 16:53.137
I'm your wife. Hold this!

16:53.262 --> 16:55.431
Why should I hold that?

16:58.434 --> 17:00.144
Where did you get this junk?

17:00.644 --> 17:01.603
Junk?

17:02.312 --> 17:05.691
This is the latest fashion trend in Yanji.

17:05.816 --> 17:07.443
And look at your hair!

17:07.568 --> 17:08.944
-What?
-It hurts! My hair!

17:09.069 --> 17:11.196
-Did you get a hair transplant?
-It hurts!

17:11.321 --> 17:13.741
-It's my natural hair!
-Where did get the money?

17:13.866 --> 17:17.244
-Having fun, huh?
-Are you crazy?

17:17.369 --> 17:18.620
Do you know what's in here?

17:21.999 --> 17:26.295
-Stop right there!
-Oh, no!

17:32.009 --> 17:34.762
So, Seok, what do you do?

17:35.429 --> 17:36.555
I'm a webtoon artist.

17:36.680 --> 17:39.058
A webtoon artist? That's fantastic!

17:39.183 --> 17:40.601
I'm just an office worker.

17:40.726 --> 17:42.644
Yeah? I'm envious of office workers.

17:42.770 --> 17:44.188
They have good job security.

17:44.313 --> 17:46.565
That's true, but it's not
the job I wanted to have.

17:47.316 --> 17:49.068
Why did you become a webtoon artist?

17:49.193 --> 17:52.738
-Did you always want to be one?
-Yes, you could say that.

17:53.238 --> 17:55.491
I saw someone laugh
while reading my cartoons.

17:56.200 --> 17:57.951
I felt really happy.

17:59.161 --> 18:00.245
So, I'm still doing it.

18:01.038 --> 18:05.000
-Wow, you're cool.
-Oh, thanks.

18:05.125 --> 18:08.337
You had a crush on someone
in high school, right?

18:09.379 --> 18:10.380
How did you know?

18:11.298 --> 18:13.801
Hey, I know things!

18:14.134 --> 18:17.221
RECONSTRUCTED MEMORY

18:18.263 --> 18:19.890
My mom was a bit different then.

18:20.015 --> 18:23.060
Back then, she thought
a man always needed to be confident.

18:23.560 --> 18:24.978
It happened that day.

18:25.104 --> 18:29.650
My mom had my school uniform
made with luxurious silk.

18:29.775 --> 18:31.276
PEACEFUL FACE

18:48.669 --> 18:52.089
Clothes are important.
She can't tear her eyes away from me.

18:57.177 --> 18:58.929
Ah, it's so hot.

19:14.778 --> 19:18.282
Excuse me. Here.

19:25.664 --> 19:27.749
She's into me. It's not bad.

19:45.517 --> 19:47.769
Do you like me?

19:50.981 --> 19:53.817
This amount of rain
is just a sprinkle to a real man.

20:05.621 --> 20:07.206
You should take this.

20:07.497 --> 20:08.415
No, thanks.

20:08.540 --> 20:10.584
-Just take it.
-No, I'm--

20:14.379 --> 20:18.258
Ae-bong liked me,
but she was too shy to speak to me.

20:19.218 --> 20:23.597
I remember you, the shy girl.

20:24.473 --> 20:25.599
Was I?

20:25.724 --> 20:27.351
Don't you remember anything about me?

20:28.560 --> 20:29.728
A few things.

20:30.354 --> 20:31.855
Pick your secret friend.

20:31.980 --> 20:35.817
You're going to be
that friend's secret angel.

20:36.068 --> 20:38.487
SEOK CHO

20:41.365 --> 20:44.284
-Hey, who's Seok Cho?
-Him.

20:53.418 --> 20:55.671
-Is he mentally challenged?
-Yes.

20:57.839 --> 21:00.092
What's wrong with his uniform?

21:05.389 --> 21:06.431
Ah, it's so hot.

21:14.564 --> 21:17.025
He's probably so hungry,
he came to fill up on water.

21:17.693 --> 21:19.152
Do I have anything to eat?

21:20.404 --> 21:22.656
Hey, take this.

21:52.644 --> 21:55.397
Gosh, of all the people
I could've picked as my secret friend...

22:12.164 --> 22:14.291
Ae-bong, there's your secret friend!

22:15.167 --> 22:16.793
That moron!

22:23.550 --> 22:26.136
Hey, take this.

22:27.095 --> 22:28.597
No, thanks.

22:41.818 --> 22:43.612
I'm okay. You can have it. Just take it.

22:49.659 --> 22:52.329
I'm his secret friend, so I need to try.
He's mentally challenged.

22:52.829 --> 22:54.873
You're so nice.
You're going to Heaven. Good job!

23:01.338 --> 23:03.799
I was your secret friend.
That's why I gave you that umbrella.

23:04.591 --> 23:07.135
Secret friend? That's a good one.

23:07.260 --> 23:10.138
All right, I'll act like I buy that story.

23:10.263 --> 23:11.306
Yeah, right.

23:20.649 --> 23:24.236
I had a good time today.
Can we see each other again?

23:24.361 --> 23:25.862
Of course!

23:32.077 --> 23:34.121
Why isn't it opening?

23:35.497 --> 23:36.832
Hello, anyone there?

23:39.793 --> 23:41.169
Hello!

23:51.388 --> 23:52.931
It's so boring.

23:53.306 --> 23:55.308
I knew this security guard job
wouldn't suit me.

23:56.476 --> 23:57.519
Hello!

24:02.482 --> 24:04.192
Let's call 911.

24:06.194 --> 24:07.779
What are we gonna do?

24:07.904 --> 24:10.615
-I'm not getting a signal.
-Me, neither.

24:10.740 --> 24:12.409
What are we gonna do?
We're on the 4th floor.

24:12.534 --> 24:15.453
-What if it falls all of a sudden?
-Fall?

24:18.832 --> 24:21.418
-Hello.
-Hi, I'm Seok's friend.

24:21.918 --> 24:23.795
You're Seok's friend?

24:24.296 --> 24:27.924
Yes, Seok is in the hospital
because of a severe injury.

24:28.049 --> 24:30.135
Please send me money
for the hospital bill immediately.

24:30.468 --> 24:32.846
Yes, hold on a second.

24:34.723 --> 24:36.766
How much is it?
Give me your account number.

24:37.184 --> 24:39.060
What happened?
How did he get injured?

24:39.186 --> 24:43.732
He came here
with his friends and girlfriend,

24:43.857 --> 24:46.109
and he got into a traffic accident!

24:47.861 --> 24:50.030
What a big fat liar!

24:50.155 --> 24:53.283
I know this is voice phishing!

24:53.992 --> 24:55.785
My son has no friends,

24:55.911 --> 24:57.704
and he definitely
doesn't have a girlfriend!

24:57.829 --> 24:59.247
You rotten liar!

24:59.873 --> 25:01.958
If you want to trick me,
tell me something that makes sense!

25:02.375 --> 25:04.002
Pathetic loser!

25:04.669 --> 25:06.796
Where is he, anyway?

25:07.672 --> 25:08.965
I'm running out of oxygen.

25:16.723 --> 25:19.809
Stop it! You think you're
the only one who needs air?

25:19.935 --> 25:23.146
I need to breathe, too.
Try to save some oxygen.

25:28.860 --> 25:30.528
This is all your fault, you...!

25:30.654 --> 25:32.822
I wanted to use the stairs!

25:32.948 --> 25:34.658
Stop talking nonsense, you...!

25:36.868 --> 25:38.662
It's so hot! So hot.

25:40.163 --> 25:43.458
Please save us!

25:45.460 --> 25:48.421
I don't want to die in here!

25:58.265 --> 25:59.683
We didn't press the button.

26:02.811 --> 26:07.440
Ae-bong, I cried just so that you
wouldn't be embarrassed. Are you okay?

26:12.821 --> 26:15.282
Ae-bong might have been waiting
for this moment.

26:15.615 --> 26:18.159
Right, I should give her
a chance to confess her love.

26:19.286 --> 26:22.872
Ae-bong, tell me everything.
I'm ready to listen.

26:25.917 --> 26:27.210
No need to be shy.

26:28.253 --> 26:30.463
All right, I'll tell you.

26:30.588 --> 26:34.009
While you weren't looking...

26:34.551 --> 26:35.552
I ate things.

26:37.262 --> 26:38.430
What?

26:40.098 --> 26:42.142
-Not that.
-I ate this one, too.

26:52.193 --> 26:54.070
I mean, when we were in high school.

26:54.362 --> 26:56.948
In high school,
I stole your high-tech pens.

26:58.241 --> 26:59.868
Not that.
Tell me about the rainy day.

26:59.993 --> 27:01.995
That day, when the kids were laughing
at your uniform,

27:02.120 --> 27:03.330
I called you a moron, too.

27:03.496 --> 27:06.249
Sorry, I really thought you were
mentally challenged.

27:06.374 --> 27:07.667
But I didn't call you a pervert.

27:07.959 --> 27:10.837
I told them you looked mentally
challenged, but were actually really nice.

27:10.962 --> 27:13.506
I said you were a bit slow,
so we should help...

27:13.631 --> 27:15.050
Stop talking. Please stop!

27:15.175 --> 27:17.469
I thought you were stupid, but I never
called you mentally challenged.

27:17.594 --> 27:19.804
Oh, I called you
mentally challenged once.

27:19.929 --> 27:22.349
But I didn't really mean it. I--

27:47.374 --> 27:49.459
I SHOULDN'T HAVE MET WITH HER

28:04.182 --> 28:05.558
SEOK CHO

28:10.355 --> 28:13.066
-Hello.
-Ae-bong, how have you been?

28:13.858 --> 28:15.026
Oh, well, fine.

28:15.777 --> 28:17.987
I sent you an e-mail.
Can you take a look at it?

28:31.251 --> 28:33.878
OH, CRAP!

28:34.295 --> 28:35.422
SAVE US!

28:40.635 --> 28:42.679
WAH!

28:46.307 --> 28:47.934
HE PULLED THE TRIGGER HALFWAY

28:57.110 --> 28:58.862
Why did you become a webtoon artist?

29:01.239 --> 29:05.034
I saw someone laugh
while reading my cartoons.
