    Rosanna: This week
    marks the anniversary

00:02.536 --> 00:04.570
    Of joe carroll's death.

00:04.572 --> 00:06.372
        Ryan: Joe was here.
        He got away.

00:06.374 --> 00:07.339
        Somebody tipped him off.

00:07.341 --> 00:09.274
        Someone inside the fbi
        is helping him.

00:09.276 --> 00:11.010
                You made me
                give up the fbi.

00:11.012 --> 00:12.177
        Please, jana.

00:12.179 --> 00:14.146
Tell me about korban.

00:14.148 --> 00:14.847
                Korban?

00:14.849 --> 00:16.515
        Well, it's still there
        as far as I know.

00:16.517 --> 00:18.017
            Emma: What kind
            of cult is this?

00:18.019 --> 00:21.120
Joe: Roderick identified them
    as a vulnerable group.

00:21.122 --> 00:23.255
        Hey, robert, I'm sorry
        we're so late.

00:23.257 --> 00:24.890
Sorry, joe, we wanted
to bring you in

00:24.892 --> 00:26.225
        -A different way.
            -Hey, whoa.

00:26.227 --> 00:27.659
            Julia: All of you,
            on your knees.

00:27.661 --> 00:28.861
            If you want
            to enter,

00:28.863 --> 00:29.928
            You must
            humble yourself.

00:29.930 --> 00:31.296
        I know out in the world,
        you're a big deal

00:31.298 --> 00:33.165
        With a killer cult and
        a bunch of followers,

00:33.167 --> 00:35.534
            But in here,
            you're the follower.

00:35.536 --> 00:36.668
                Joe: Good to
                meet you, micah.

00:36.670 --> 00:39.405
So I'm guessing you're looking
for a place to hide out.

00:39.407 --> 00:40.939
What can you
offer me, joe?

00:40.941 --> 00:43.108
            I offer you
            my humble service

00:43.110 --> 00:46.245
            In exchange for
            your hospitality.

00:46.247 --> 00:48.480
Who among you is ready

00:48.482 --> 00:51.984
To make the sacrifice?

00:51.986 --> 00:53.552
        [applause]

00:53.554 --> 00:56.388
                Emma: No! No!

00:56.390 --> 00:57.389
    Aah!

00:57.391 --> 00:58.390
Joe: Why did
you do it?

00:58.392 --> 01:00.959
        Julia: Emma's alive.
        You'll see her soon.

01:00.961 --> 01:02.694
            It was a necessary
            introduction

01:02.696 --> 01:03.796
            To our ways.

01:03.798 --> 01:05.531
            Ryan: Lily just
            sent me a text.

01:05.533 --> 01:08.167
I know that place.
It's my dad's house.

01:08.169 --> 01:10.702
        Lily: Say hello
        to your son, richard.

01:10.704 --> 01:14.106
        You take from me,
        I take from you.

01:14.108 --> 01:16.208
    [sobs]

01:17.377 --> 01:20.112
        Man: Ready...

01:20.114 --> 01:22.614
            Aim...

01:22.616 --> 01:24.183
            Fire.

01:24.185 --> 01:26.185
    Different man: O god,

01:26.187 --> 01:28.187
    As we gather together,

01:28.189 --> 01:32.925
        All too aware
    of the fragility of life...

02:21.241 --> 02:22.508
                Thank you.

02:22.510 --> 02:24.176
I'm eric.

02:24.178 --> 02:26.044
            I'm mandy. I'm new.

02:26.046 --> 02:28.347
Ha! Really?
I didn't notice.

02:28.349 --> 02:32.217
Ha ha!
It's nice to meet you.

02:32.219 --> 02:34.920
                Heh heh.

02:36.456 --> 02:38.190
                    Hey...

02:38.192 --> 02:40.192
        How are you
        feeling today?

02:40.194 --> 02:42.928
My arms were sliced open.
How do you think?

02:42.930 --> 02:45.664
        Yeah, but the stitches
        are healing, yeah?

02:45.666 --> 02:47.166
We have to get
out of here, joe.

02:47.168 --> 02:50.702
            Let's just...
            Keep our voice down,

02:50.704 --> 02:53.105
                Hmm, please?

02:53.107 --> 02:56.275
I want to go.

02:56.277 --> 02:57.142
                Where?

02:57.144 --> 02:58.477
            Ryan knows
            I'm alive.

02:58.479 --> 03:00.879
        The fbi will be looking
        for us everywhere.

03:00.881 --> 03:02.714
But this place is nuts.

03:02.716 --> 03:06.785
            Yes and...And no.

03:06.787 --> 03:08.053
        The last few days,

03:08.055 --> 03:10.656
        I've been
        studying this place.

03:10.658 --> 03:13.625
        We have a real
        opportunity here, em.

03:13.627 --> 03:14.293
For what?

03:14.295 --> 03:17.462
            We have so much more
            yet to accomplish,

03:17.464 --> 03:19.998
            But we cannot
            do it alone.

03:20.000 --> 03:21.767
            We need this place,

03:21.769 --> 03:24.903
            And with a bit
            of finesse,

03:24.905 --> 03:27.105
            It could be ours.

03:27.107 --> 03:29.174
                Good morning,
                my children.

03:29.176 --> 03:31.443
    All: Good morning, micah.

03:31.445 --> 03:33.979
            I have a special
            announcement.

03:33.981 --> 03:35.447
This can't be good.

03:35.449 --> 03:37.482
            Micah:
        Today we welcome

03:37.484 --> 03:40.886
    3 new members into
        our family.

03:40.888 --> 03:43.488
    [cheering and applause]

03:43.490 --> 03:46.391
        Please rise.

03:52.498 --> 03:53.966
        Before korban,

03:53.968 --> 03:58.136
    The 3 standing before you
    were full of darkness.

03:58.138 --> 04:01.173
    Their souls were empty,

04:01.175 --> 04:04.509
    But I have made them
        new, pure.

04:04.511 --> 04:09.014
        Joe, emma, mandy,

04:09.016 --> 04:10.983
        We welcome you.

04:10.985 --> 04:13.452
        Korban is family.

04:13.454 --> 04:15.520
        Korban is love.

04:15.522 --> 04:19.257
    All: Korban is family.
        Korban is love.

04:19.260 --> 04:22.761
You no longer
need these.

04:33.773 --> 04:35.907
            Are you sure
            about this, micah?

04:35.909 --> 04:37.709
            If we should be
            recognized--

04:37.711 --> 04:43.515
It doesn't matter who
you were beyond our walls.

04:45.818 --> 04:48.587
    [scattered murmurs]

04:51.991 --> 04:56.628
You're family,
and we accept you.

04:58.498 --> 05:00.399
    We are one.

05:00.401 --> 05:03.335
    [cheering and applause]

05:03.337 --> 05:06.071
    Micah: Korban is family.
        Korban is love.

05:06.073 --> 05:10.742
    All: Korban is family.
    Korban is love.

05:11.744 --> 05:13.679
Was a nice service.

05:13.681 --> 05:15.180
                    Yeah.

05:15.182 --> 05:16.548
How you doing?

05:16.550 --> 05:19.484
            I'm ok, not great.
            You?

05:19.486 --> 05:20.652
    Same.

05:20.654 --> 05:22.788
Hello, ryan.

05:29.195 --> 05:33.198
            Mmm! Ah! Ha ha ha!

05:33.200 --> 05:34.032
One more.

05:34.034 --> 05:36.868
        Oh, wow, you can
        really throw them back.

05:36.870 --> 05:39.738
Oh, come on.
Don't be a lightweight.

05:39.740 --> 05:41.707
                    Ok.

05:41.709 --> 05:44.109
    Ha ha!

05:44.111 --> 05:46.078
                Really?

05:46.080 --> 05:47.479
                A funeral?

05:47.481 --> 05:49.815
            Nothing's
            off limits to you?

05:49.817 --> 05:51.516
My condolences.

05:51.518 --> 05:53.018
            What do you want?

05:53.020 --> 05:55.287
I know joe carroll
is alive.

05:55.289 --> 05:57.155
Care to comment?

05:58.124 --> 06:00.525
"when asked if
joe carroll was alive,

06:00.527 --> 06:02.828
Ryan hardy dodged
the question."

06:02.830 --> 06:05.564
        I'm not dodging anything
        except for maybe

06:05.566 --> 06:08.033
        Your pathetic attempt
        at journalism.

06:08.035 --> 06:09.468
Is that a yes
or a no?

06:09.470 --> 06:11.236
I interviewed
a private pilot

06:11.238 --> 06:13.438
Who claims you are
convinced that joe carroll

06:13.440 --> 06:15.507
Was trying to get
on his plane.

06:15.509 --> 06:17.175
Why would he lie
about that?

06:17.177 --> 06:18.076
            I don't know.

06:18.078 --> 06:19.644
            Maybe he was trying
            to lie his way

06:19.646 --> 06:20.479
            Into your next book.

06:20.481 --> 06:22.114
        We both know the truth
        doesn't matter to you.

06:22.116 --> 06:25.751
Yes, it does, ryan.
Have you even read my book?

06:25.753 --> 06:27.919
What part isn't true?

06:27.921 --> 06:29.187
Please tell me.

06:29.189 --> 06:31.590
            I'm gonna be
            really polite here

06:31.592 --> 06:33.592
            And just say,

06:33.594 --> 06:35.827
            "go to hell."

06:42.769 --> 06:44.436
What'd that
sleaze want?

06:44.438 --> 06:46.738
            She was fishing,
            about joe.

06:46.740 --> 06:48.440
She knows
he's alive?

06:48.442 --> 06:49.975
            Ryan: Suspects.

06:49.977 --> 06:52.210
            She talked to the
            pilot in stratford.

06:52.212 --> 06:54.112
            Let the fbi
            shut her down.

06:54.114 --> 06:57.716
            I can't stand
            to look at her.

07:02.622 --> 07:04.589
    [overlapping chatter]

07:04.591 --> 07:07.459
            Man: Hey.
        Woman: Heh heh!

07:07.461 --> 07:09.060
                    Welcome.

07:09.062 --> 07:10.962
This is so weird.

07:10.964 --> 07:12.431
        Joe: Uh-huh.

07:12.433 --> 07:13.732
Eric: Mandy!

07:13.734 --> 07:16.768
I wondered what you looked
like without that mask.

07:16.770 --> 07:18.103
                    And?

07:18.105 --> 07:20.872
Even better.

07:21.641 --> 07:23.742
            Come on.

07:23.744 --> 07:25.544
                Yeah. Go ahead.

07:25.546 --> 07:27.879
Have fun.

        [snickers]

07:31.051 --> 07:33.385
            Julia: Micah
            wishes to see you.

07:33.387 --> 07:35.520
        Oh, ok, uh...

07:35.522 --> 07:38.857
        I--I'll be back
        in a minute.

07:43.463 --> 07:46.398
        I see the guards have
        taken a step back.

07:46.400 --> 07:47.632
                Thank you.

07:47.634 --> 07:49.668
They're always
watching you, joe.

07:49.670 --> 07:51.436
            Yeah. If I'm not
            to be trusted,

07:51.438 --> 07:53.738
            Why not have me
            sliced open

07:53.740 --> 07:55.340
            And sacrificed

07:55.342 --> 07:56.708
To the gods?

07:56.710 --> 07:57.909
            You really think
            mocking

07:57.911 --> 07:59.411
            Our religion
            will be tolerated?

07:59.413 --> 08:00.812
Ha! What religion?

08:00.814 --> 08:03.315
As far as I can tell,
you're just making it up

08:03.317 --> 08:04.649
As you go along.

08:04.651 --> 08:06.685
            Micah and I have
            spent 20 years

08:06.687 --> 08:07.752
            Building korban.

08:07.754 --> 08:09.387
            Our beliefs
            and practices

08:09.389 --> 08:10.288
            Are to be respected.

08:10.290 --> 08:12.557
            I won't stand
            for anything less.

08:12.559 --> 08:15.494
Oh. Right.

08:16.996 --> 08:19.231
            Bear one thing
            in mind--

08:19.233 --> 08:21.867
            Micah is our leader,

08:21.869 --> 08:24.503
            But I run things.

08:29.276 --> 08:31.910
                There you are.

08:34.948 --> 08:37.115
                Thanks, julia.

08:38.183 --> 08:40.919

        -Hmm?

08:46.927 --> 08:49.728
        There's something I want
        to talk to you about.

08:49.730 --> 08:51.596
            I need your help.

08:51.598 --> 08:53.865
Of course.
Anything, micah.

08:53.867 --> 08:57.602
            I want
            to kill people.

08:58.604 --> 09:00.972
        Hmm.

09:08.180 --> 09:09.314
                Mike.

09:09.316 --> 09:11.816
Director franklin,
nice of you to come.

09:11.818 --> 09:14.986
            Mike, I am so sorry
            for your loss.

09:14.988 --> 09:17.589
                If you need
                anything...

09:17.591 --> 09:18.890
        Thank you, sir.

09:18.892 --> 09:21.359
            This is the oldest
            brother's home?

09:21.361 --> 09:23.795
Yeah. He's got 3 brothers,
all military.

09:23.797 --> 09:27.032
    -Mike's the youngest?
            -Yeah.

09:27.034 --> 09:28.333
        Ryan.

09:28.335 --> 09:29.200
Hello, tom.

09:29.202 --> 09:32.604
I want you to meet my niece--
detective max hardy, nypd.

09:32.606 --> 09:34.539
    This is fbi director
        tom franklin.

09:34.541 --> 09:36.041
            It's an honor,
            director franklin.

09:36.043 --> 09:38.443
Oh, it's good to see
you're out of harm's way.

09:38.445 --> 09:40.745
I understand your uncle
has kept you quite busy.

09:40.747 --> 09:43.815
            Yes, sir.
            Never a dull moment.

09:44.183 --> 09:47.919
Can I, uh, talk with you
privately?

09:48.621 --> 09:50.789
                Sure.

09:54.660 --> 09:57.629
            It's good to see you
            again, ryan.

09:57.631 --> 09:59.564
            How's your heart?

09:59.566 --> 10:01.032
It bounced back.

10:01.034 --> 10:02.467
            You cut out
            the alcohol, I hear.

10:02.469 --> 10:05.870
It was the main culprit.
Anything on lily gray?

10:05.872 --> 10:06.972
            No one knows.

10:06.974 --> 10:09.808
        She has lawyers in
        17 different countries.

10:09.810 --> 10:11.643
        They all passed
        polygraphs.

10:11.645 --> 10:13.778
        With her money,
        she could be anywhere.

10:13.780 --> 10:16.147
What do you want
from me, tom?

10:16.149 --> 10:18.683
        I think joe carroll
        is still alive

10:18.685 --> 10:21.820
        And is still out there.

10:25.458 --> 10:27.459
What's that about?

10:27.461 --> 10:28.994
            No idea.

10:28.996 --> 10:32.197
How are you?

10:36.636 --> 10:39.371
I know what
this moment is like.

10:39.373 --> 10:41.072
I lost my dad
when I was young.

10:41.074 --> 10:44.876
Sometimes it helps to talk
to someone who gets it,

10:44.878 --> 10:47.312
    So...

10:48.948 --> 10:51.249
        Thanks for coming, max.

10:51.251 --> 10:53.385
            Means a lot.

10:56.088 --> 10:58.556
The bureau has got
to be compromised.

10:58.558 --> 11:01.126
In order for joe to fake
his own death, he would have

11:01.128 --> 11:03.928
To have somebody on
the inside to pull that off.

11:03.930 --> 11:04.562
            Agreed.

11:04.564 --> 11:06.965
        We're running background
        on all personnel,

11:06.967 --> 11:07.832
            Past and present.

11:07.834 --> 11:09.534
            I've asked
            for the cia's help,

11:09.536 --> 11:11.469
            But I need your
            help, too, ryan.

11:11.471 --> 11:12.170
How so?

11:12.172 --> 11:14.472
            I want to sanction
            you off the books.

11:14.474 --> 11:16.007
            I'll supply you with

11:16.009 --> 11:17.642
            Whatever resources
            you need.

11:17.644 --> 11:18.276
    Covert.

11:18.278 --> 11:20.679
        We'll set up a network
        directly to dc.

11:20.681 --> 11:22.647
            You'll liaise
            with my office

11:22.649 --> 11:23.715
            And no one else.

11:23.717 --> 11:25.784
            I know you want
            to find carroll.

11:25.786 --> 11:28.386
            Let me help you.

11:29.722 --> 11:31.222
    Ok.

11:31.224 --> 11:32.524
I'll do it,

11:32.526 --> 11:34.592
But I call it,
everything my way.

11:34.594 --> 11:37.028
        -Promise.
        -What's this?

11:37.030 --> 11:39.064
    The cia reached out to
    their british counterparts

11:39.066 --> 11:42.467
    And found whatever they
    could on joe's half-brother.

11:42.469 --> 11:43.702
        -William halston.
        -Joe managed to

11:43.704 --> 11:45.470
        Smuggle the body
        into the country.

11:45.472 --> 11:49.207
    That thumb drive contains
    what they uncovered.

11:49.209 --> 11:51.609
        Franklin:
        I'll be in touch.

11:53.179 --> 11:55.780
            Was that
            about lily gray?

11:55.782 --> 11:57.449
    No. We were just
    catching up.

11:57.451 --> 11:58.650
                It's been
                a long time.

11:58.652 --> 11:59.751
        You're lying.
        Try again.

11:59.753 --> 12:01.786
            I'm sorry, mike.
            It's private.

12:01.788 --> 12:04.355
Ryan, if you know anything,
you have to tell me.

12:04.357 --> 12:06.958
With or without you,
I'm gonna find lily gray.

12:06.960 --> 12:08.326
                And then what?

12:08.328 --> 12:08.993
You tell me.

12:08.995 --> 12:11.663
What are you gonna do
when you find joe?

12:12.732 --> 12:15.166
Let me help.

12:16.836 --> 12:19.704
            You need to be with
            your family now.

12:19.706 --> 12:22.373
            I'm sorry, man.

12:33.219 --> 12:35.620
So franklin is cutting out
his entire team?

12:35.622 --> 12:37.322
            Yeah. Well, until
            he finds his mole,

12:37.324 --> 12:40.191
            We deal directly
            with his office.

12:41.060 --> 12:42.961
        Ok. Who are
        these guys?

12:42.963 --> 12:44.796
        -That's halston.
        -Wait a minute.

12:44.798 --> 12:48.099
Aren't these two guys
on your wall?

12:48.101 --> 12:51.236
    Yeah.

12:51.904 --> 12:54.539
        Yeah. Wyker, douglas,

12:54.541 --> 12:56.808
            Both connected
            to roderick,

12:56.810 --> 12:58.042
            Both deceased.

12:58.044 --> 12:59.677
    Who's the older guy?

12:59.679 --> 13:02.213
Looks familiar.

13:02.215 --> 13:04.249
Wait a minute.

13:04.251 --> 13:07.051
I know him.

13:12.391 --> 13:14.459
            Yeah, here we go.

13:14.461 --> 13:16.060
            Dr. Arthur strauss.

13:16.062 --> 13:17.762
He was a counselor
at the boarding school

13:17.764 --> 13:19.097
That joe went to
in new hampshire,

13:19.099 --> 13:21.166
Mentored him
from 13 to college.

13:21.168 --> 13:23.735
I tried to interview him
for my book, but he declined,

13:23.737 --> 13:26.204
    Said he wanted to
    distance himself from joe.

13:26.206 --> 13:27.038
I'd do the same.

13:27.040 --> 13:28.773
        They had no contact
        after joe graduated,

13:28.775 --> 13:32.010
        So I dismissed him,
        but a doctor could
        come in handy

13:32.012 --> 13:34.612
        If you're trying
        to fake your own death.

13:34.614 --> 13:36.815
Guess who lives an hour
away from the lighthouse

13:36.817 --> 13:38.216
Where you supposedly
killed carroll.

13:38.218 --> 13:40.418
        That's where he went
        after he left carlos.

13:40.420 --> 13:42.987
Joe was injured.
He needed medical attention.

13:42.989 --> 13:45.557
            Can you give me
            that address?

13:47.393 --> 13:48.793
Jericho, long island.

13:48.795 --> 13:51.796
        All right, you got
        my new cell? I'll call
        you from the road.

13:51.798 --> 13:54.232
Ok. I'll be here.

13:56.035 --> 13:58.136
    Hmm. Look at you,

13:58.138 --> 14:00.104
    All soft and fuzzy.

14:00.106 --> 14:01.339
                Shut up.

14:01.341 --> 14:03.274
    Mm-hmm.

14:04.743 --> 14:08.680
Micah: Our entire scripture
is based on cleansing our souls

14:08.682 --> 14:12.250
So that we can be ready
for our real life.

14:12.252 --> 14:14.285
There is no afterlife.

14:14.287 --> 14:15.920
There is a prelife,

14:15.922 --> 14:17.255
Which is now.

14:17.257 --> 14:20.825
We don't begin
until we reach home.

14:20.827 --> 14:21.793
            And where is home?

14:21.795 --> 14:25.830
It's the ninth planet,
just behind neptune.

14:28.534 --> 14:30.802
And how do we
get there?

14:30.804 --> 14:32.203
    We have to earn it

14:32.205 --> 14:34.372
        Here on earth
        by saving souls.

14:34.374 --> 14:36.441
        We have to eat
        the sins of others,

14:36.443 --> 14:39.711
And then, when we have
saved enough, we ascend.

14:39.713 --> 14:42.780
        Help me understand
        something here, micah.

14:42.782 --> 14:47.085
        Why, exactly, do you
        want to kill people?

14:47.087 --> 14:49.120
To save souls...

14:49.122 --> 14:50.488
And et cetera.

14:50.490 --> 14:51.923
Yeah. I've been thinking.

14:51.925 --> 14:55.159
Do you know there are
over 5,000 cults

14:55.161 --> 14:56.895
In the u.S.?
That's a lot.

14:56.897 --> 14:59.264
How do you stand out
from the pack?

14:59.266 --> 15:01.666
Look at the ones
who did:

15:01.668 --> 15:05.370
Jim jones, david koresh,
charles manson.

15:05.372 --> 15:08.673
You know, manson and I
have a lot in common

15:08.675 --> 15:10.808
Because we both have
musical backgrounds.

15:10.810 --> 15:13.811
The point is, they all
killed a lot of people.

15:13.813 --> 15:16.281
And then there's you.
You're royalty.

15:16.283 --> 15:20.151
See, all the others
were caught and killed.

15:20.586 --> 15:23.021
I read all about you
in the book.

15:23.023 --> 15:25.657
See, here's
the thing, joe.

15:25.659 --> 15:29.394
I want a book
written about me,

15:29.396 --> 15:32.030
And I want you
to write it.

15:32.032 --> 15:32.830
            Me?

15:32.832 --> 15:36.100
        I haven't done terribly
        well in this medium.

15:36.102 --> 15:39.170
Well, that "dark sea"
was hard to get through.

15:39.172 --> 15:40.171
                "gothic."

15:40.173 --> 15:41.706
            -Huh?
        -Micah, you have

15:41.708 --> 15:43.975
        The very best
        of intentions here,

15:43.977 --> 15:47.145
        But my desire to kill
        is based on a--

15:47.147 --> 15:51.215
        A psychopathic need
        to kill.

15:51.217 --> 15:54.052
        I find a terrible
        beauty in it.

15:54.054 --> 15:56.621
Yes. You had a message.
I do, too.

15:56.623 --> 15:58.256
And I want to share it
with the world.

15:58.258 --> 16:03.094
        Who's gonna do all
        this soul saving, hmm?

16:03.096 --> 16:05.763
        You're still gonna need
        to find people

16:05.765 --> 16:08.766
        Who have a desire
        to kill.

16:08.768 --> 16:11.769
            I got that, too.

16:22.481 --> 16:25.950
        [classical music
        playing within]

16:25.952 --> 16:29.554
        [doorbell rings]

16:35.361 --> 16:36.494
Can I help you?

16:36.496 --> 16:39.030
        Dr. Strauss, I'm not
        sure if you remember--

16:39.032 --> 16:40.631
Of course I do,
mr. Hardy.

16:40.633 --> 16:44.135
I'm afraid I still have
nothing to say to you.

16:44.903 --> 16:48.673
            Please. It'll only
            take a few minutes.

16:48.675 --> 16:50.541
I have nothing--

16:50.543 --> 16:51.976
            I'm not going away.

16:51.978 --> 16:53.511
            So if you won't
            talk to me,

16:53.513 --> 16:56.481
        You better call
        the police right now.

16:56.483 --> 16:59.684
All right.
You have 5 minutes.

17:05.590 --> 17:08.559
        I take it this is about
        the murders in new york.

17:08.560 --> 17:10.060
No. Actually,
it's about joe.

17:10.063 --> 17:11.796
Just trying to get
some background on him.

17:11.798 --> 17:13.664
Tell me about your
relationship with him.

17:13.665 --> 17:15.066
            Exactly what
            is documented--

17:15.068 --> 17:17.167
        He was one of many
        students I looked after

17:17.170 --> 17:19.137
        During my time
        at lightford academy.

17:19.138 --> 17:21.705
Yeah. He acknowledged
you in his book,

17:21.708 --> 17:23.441
Called you a mentor.

17:23.443 --> 17:26.344
            Ah...Along with
            12 other people.

17:26.346 --> 17:27.412
            Are you harassing
            them, too?

17:27.414 --> 17:28.479
            When I knew joe,
            he was alone.

17:29.882 --> 17:31.682
            His parents
            had died.

17:31.684 --> 17:33.851
            He was an orphan
            in a foreign land,

17:33.853 --> 17:35.787
            Shipped here
            by an uncle

17:35.789 --> 17:37.755
            Who wanted nothing
            to do with him.

17:37.757 --> 17:40.158
            I gave him the same
            guidance I gave

17:40.160 --> 17:41.592
            All my students.

17:41.594 --> 17:43.828
            When he left
            for college,

17:43.830 --> 17:45.029
            We lost touch.

17:45.031 --> 17:47.365
Did you ever see signs
of psychopathy?

17:47.367 --> 17:49.967
            No, no, I was
            quite shocked

17:49.969 --> 17:51.669
            When I heard
            about the murders.

17:51.671 --> 17:54.005
        Took me a great deal of
        time to even believe it.

17:54.007 --> 17:55.640
When was the last time
you saw him?

17:55.642 --> 17:58.476
            The day after
            he graduated.

18:00.879 --> 18:03.614
So, are you retired?

18:05.585 --> 18:08.219
            The rest of the time
            is spent teaching.

18:08.221 --> 18:09.253
    Ah.

18:09.255 --> 18:10.955
Is that what you
were doing last year

18:10.957 --> 18:14.025
In oxford, England--
teaching?

18:14.027 --> 18:15.460
            [chuckles]

18:15.462 --> 18:18.362
            I've never been to
            oxford, mr. Hardy.

18:18.364 --> 18:21.299
            I'm sorry, but
            I've tolerated this

18:21.301 --> 18:24.001
            About as long
            as I can.

18:27.039 --> 18:30.541
Ok. Thanks
for your time.

18:40.752 --> 18:43.221
    [cell phone rings]
    how'd it go?

18:43.223 --> 18:44.989
He had very
little to say.

    -Did you plant the bug?
        -Living room.

18:47.293 --> 18:49.293

            the doc's phones.

            It was super fast.
            Franklin has
            major access.

18:51.798 --> 18:54.532
        I'm also monitoring
        the nearest cell tower.

18:54.534 --> 18:56.434
        Did you scare the doctor
        enough to call in joe?

18:56.436 --> 18:59.370
Let's hope so. Call me
if you get anything.

18:59.372 --> 19:01.038

I'm carrie cooke.

        you people are all
        showing up today.

19:43.750 --> 19:45.516

That's easy.

joe carroll is alive

19:48.121 --> 19:50.054
And that you know
where he is.

19:50.056 --> 19:51.122
Care to comment?

19:51.124 --> 19:54.292
        Last time I saw
        joe carroll, he was 17.

19:54.294 --> 19:56.294
            I've made that
            quite clear.

19:56.296 --> 19:57.428
    Really?

19:57.430 --> 19:59.497
My sources put you
at winslow university

19:59.499 --> 20:01.933
On April 4, 1997.

20:01.935 --> 20:04.068
Did you not
see him then?

20:04.070 --> 20:06.304
And on June 12, 1999,

20:06.306 --> 20:08.906
Once again, you visited
the university.

20:12.010 --> 20:14.212

Ryan:
Stop right there.

20:59.559 --> 21:02.994
        You should've
        stayed away, mr. Hardy.

        play well with others.

23:28.274 --> 23:31.876
            Then we drank and
            talked some more.

            Hmm. Nothing?

23:36.047 --> 23:39.350

        With precision,

24:44.383 --> 24:46.750
        But to kill, no.

24:46.752 --> 24:49.687
        That was already
        a part of his dna.

24:49.689 --> 24:51.155
                You trained him.

24:51.157 --> 24:53.757
I inspired him.

24:54.459 --> 24:58.329
        To teach young minds
        is a gift, ryan.

24:58.331 --> 25:02.666

have you taught?

        through the years.

25:12.545 --> 25:14.512
    They come and go.

25:14.514 --> 25:18.182
    Joe knew who he was.

25:18.717 --> 25:21.485
    He just needed
    to be told it was ok.

25:21.487 --> 25:24.788
    I'm sure you've had
    people in your life

25:24.790 --> 25:27.258
            Who unexpectedly
            speak to you,

    Even what you
    already know,

25:29.662 --> 25:32.263
    But for some reason,
    the message is clear,

25:32.265 --> 25:36.000
    And you hear it
    for the first time.

25:36.002 --> 25:39.169
When the student
is ready,

25:39.171 --> 25:42.606
The teacher
always appears.

25:49.648 --> 25:51.448
Maybe we should start
with a murder spree

to save in l.A.

target celebrities.

            I don't think
            you should

            too famous.

26:01.727 --> 26:04.728

            of being upstaged.

            No. New york.

26:06.065 --> 26:07.598
            New york
            is more appropriate.

26:07.600 --> 26:09.533
            It's closer,
            more accessible.

26:09.535 --> 26:11.769
            Well, besides, the
            entire world watches

26:11.771 --> 26:13.070
            What happens
            in new york.

26:13.072 --> 26:14.305
Yes. You're right.

why you're here--

God puts people in
our paths for a reason.

26:22.648 --> 26:24.481
            And is everyone
            on board

26:24.483 --> 26:26.884
            With this new
            direction of yours?

26:26.886 --> 26:27.451
    Yes.

26:27.453 --> 26:31.121
        Have you discussed this
        with your wife?

26:31.123 --> 26:34.525

a handful.

26:34.527 --> 26:35.426
                Oh.

26:35.428 --> 26:36.360

26:36.362 --> 26:38.329
We should be a part
of the outside world.

26:38.331 --> 26:41.732
But she's my wife.
She'll do as I choose.

26:41.734 --> 26:42.666
                Right,

26:42.668 --> 26:45.202
            And the rest
            of your following,

26:45.204 --> 26:47.304
            You're sure
            they're willing

26:47.306 --> 26:49.373
            To take such
            extreme measures?

26:49.375 --> 26:52.042
