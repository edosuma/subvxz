00:36.166 --> 00:37.955
Pretty isn't it, Morning Star?

00:39.850 --> 00:41.857
I love being alone up here.

00:42.359 --> 00:45.134
Makes me feel... like me.

00:46.933 --> 00:48.472
And cut!

00:48.584 --> 00:50.569
Back to one, we're going again!

00:51.061 --> 00:52.194
That was great!

00:52.219 --> 00:54.259
Can't have one hair out of place!

00:54.549 --> 00:56.167
Be sure to get her best angle.

00:56.202 --> 00:57.710
Turn this way to get the light.

00:57.747 --> 00:59.013
Okay...

01:02.790 --> 01:05.025
Ooh, looking gorgeous!

01:05.050 --> 01:06.285
Gorgeous.

01:11.685 --> 01:13.848
It's starting to rain! Oh, no! Her hair!

01:14.251 --> 01:15.328
It's getting wet!

01:15.414 --> 01:17.570
Quick, get the umbrellas!

01:20.583 --> 01:22.248
Come on. Oh no!

01:22.416 --> 01:23.947
Let's go, let's go! She's getting wet!

01:23.972 --> 01:26.465
 Help her! Somebody cover her!

01:26.630 --> 01:28.005
Oh, No!

01:41.828 --> 01:43.773
Earth to Barbie!

01:44.018 --> 01:45.995
What has you so spaced out?

01:46.027 --> 01:47.496
Oh, sorry, Daisy.

01:47.591 --> 01:49.419
Thanks for helping with the video shoot.

01:49.540 --> 01:51.852
Now all I need is a hook for our song.

01:51.924 --> 01:53.979
Okay, girls! We're all set.

01:54.004 --> 01:55.010
Thanks, dad.

01:55.265 --> 01:57.647
Where to, first? Paris?

01:58.308 --> 01:59.894
Peru? Aww!

01:59.939 --> 02:01.420
Only the Roberts would have a

02:01.458 --> 02:03.234
portable green screen.

02:03.403 --> 02:05.715
Should make a pretty cool vlog post...

02:05.794 --> 02:08.083
assuming we finish the song first.

02:08.128 --> 02:09.668
Can I be in your vlog?

02:13.311 --> 02:15.170
Hey, Chelsea! What you got there?

02:15.364 --> 02:16.749
My dress-up box.

02:16.818 --> 02:17.943
I wanted to play  with

02:17.968 --> 02:19.960
 Skipper and Stacie, but...

02:20.034 --> 02:21.792
En garde! En garde!

02:26.715 --> 02:29.215
They said dress-up was for babies.

02:29.297 --> 02:30.934
That wasn't nice, girls.

02:31.031 --> 02:32.864
Sorry, Chels, but we're talking life

02:32.889 --> 02:34.145
and death stakes here!

02:34.186 --> 02:35.538
We're testing out these--ugh!

02:35.612 --> 02:37.767
new laser swords I made!

02:37.832 --> 02:38.911
Oh, no, the puppy!

02:38.984 --> 02:40.547
What's wrong with the puppies?

02:42.457 --> 02:43.817
Ugh! Gotcha!

02:44.327 --> 02:49.597
Ugh! You tricked me! Not cool! Ugh.

02:50.006 --> 02:51.162
I wanna play!

02:51.258 --> 02:56.003
I could be... the laser pirate princess!

02:56.307 --> 02:59.365
Pirates don't use lasers or wear crowns.

02:59.405 --> 03:00.905
Skipper, seriously?

03:01.001 --> 03:03.377
Pirates can wear crowns the same way girls

03:03.411 --> 03:04.904
can make laser swords.

03:04.947 --> 03:06.978
You can be whatever you wanna be.

03:07.056 --> 03:09.009
What if you don't know what you wanna be?

03:09.095 --> 03:10.306
That's what this is for!

03:10.377 --> 03:12.010
To try a few things out.

03:12.127 --> 03:13.932
That's right, Chels.

03:14.115 --> 03:17.195
In fact, I think you just solved
my vlog problem.

03:17.547 --> 03:20.586
Daisy, play that song we were working on.

03:28.340 --> 03:30.066
Who do you wanna see

03:30.091 --> 03:32.323
When you're looking in the mirror?

03:32.333 --> 03:34.000
Anything you can dream

03:34.025 --> 03:35.875
Is yours to tailor-make

03:36.313 --> 03:38.165
Stepping in different shoes

03:38.204 --> 03:40.329
Is like a new adventure

03:40.372 --> 03:43.803
So dress it up and
Mix it up, yeah

03:44.250 --> 03:48.201
Say hello, hello
to all the sides of who you are

03:48.240 --> 03:51.940
Never know what you might find

03:52.011 --> 03:54.058
Try it on

03:54.105 --> 03:56.144
You can be who you wanna be

03:56.169 --> 03:59.253
All the possibilities, whoa

03:59.279 --> 04:01.854
Come on and try it on

04:01.968 --> 04:07.288
Take a chance, see what you got
Don't let yourself get put inside a box

04:07.367 --> 04:11.393
Just try it on

04:11.558 --> 04:15.605
Just try it on

04:16.130 --> 04:19.389
Who cares what they expect to see

04:19.730 --> 04:23.168
We're more than who we're supposed to be

04:23.596 --> 04:27.588
Who cares what they expect to see

04:27.613 --> 04:32.458
Show the world your limit's the sky

04:32.482 --> 04:35.451
When you try it on

04:35.478 --> 04:37.439
You can be who you wanna be

04:37.464 --> 04:40.508
All the possibilities, whoa

04:40.548 --> 04:43.104
Come on and try it on

04:43.139 --> 04:48.654
Take a chance, see what you got
Don't let yourself get put inside a box

04:48.947 --> 04:50.751
 Just try it on

04:51.048 --> 04:52.868
Take a chance, see what you got

04:52.908 --> 04:55.021
Just try it on

04:55.069 --> 04:59.319
Don't get put inside a box
Try it on

05:00.417 --> 05:03.948
Spatial show up to my dad
for filming that for us

05:04.046 --> 05:06.288
My friend Daisy and I...
Hi!

05:06.377 --> 05:10.169
Wrote the song together and my sisters
really inspired the lyrics.

05:10.211 --> 05:13.410
So fun. And it's a really great message,
you know?

05:13.442 --> 05:15.661
Hope you liked it! Don't forget to comment.

05:15.686 --> 05:17.090
Bye!
Bye!

05:17.174 --> 05:19.841
I really like how that turned out.

05:19.919 --> 05:23.591
Look, you already got a new subscriber.

05:23.682 --> 05:28.672
That's great. The whole reason
I do this vlog is to inspire people.

05:28.737 --> 05:32.908
I just wish there were a better way
to reach more of them.

05:33.034 --> 05:39.548
try it onTake a chance, see what you got

05:39.587 --> 05:43.970
Don't get put inside a box
Try it on

05:46.594 --> 05:48.367
Have a good time today?

05:48.423 --> 05:53.290
Oh, Alfonso.
Yes, Morning Star and I love the rain.

05:53.439 --> 05:55.767
Too bad the photo shoot was ruined.

05:55.838 --> 05:59.737
It was raining! People understand that
when it rains, you get wet.

05:59.779 --> 06:01.639
Normal people get wet.

06:01.725 --> 06:04.842
You know the world holds you
to a higher standard.

06:04.902 --> 06:06.105
I wish they wouldn't.

06:06.238 --> 06:10.857
I mean, for once it would be so great
to just let the world see me as me.

06:11.069 --> 06:13.780
And what does that mean, exactly?

06:13.805 --> 06:16.063
I... I don't know.

06:16.172 --> 06:20.992
Exactly. You're young;
you have so much to learn about the world.

06:21.109 --> 06:23.671
Oh, not that one.
This one is better.

06:23.750 --> 06:27.312
Alfonso, I'm almost 18.
I'm about to be queen.

06:27.406 --> 06:29.461
. You've trained me so well.

06:29.516 --> 06:31.735
When are you gonna
let me make my own decisions?

06:31.846 --> 06:33.784
When I know you're ready.

06:33.823 --> 06:38.169
Until then it's my job to protect you...
from yourself.

06:46.877 --> 06:50.924
Hello!
Hey, Barbie! Congrats on the new vlog post.

06:50.958 --> 06:53.684
Aw, thanks!
You doing anything after school?

06:53.723 --> 06:55.682
Maybe we could...
Scoot over, Roberts!

06:55.706 --> 06:58.683
Make way for the King of Malibu!

06:58.732 --> 07:01.491
Uh, 'scuse me. Well, pardon.

07:01.651 --> 07:02.687
Settle, settle.

07:02.711 --> 07:03.968
I have some news.

07:04.006 --> 07:07.053
Huge news, in fact,
so I'm just gonna dive in.

07:08.111 --> 07:11.875
Golden Beach High has
been selected to participate

07:11.899 --> 07:15.663
in the first ever Malibu-Floravia
Cultural Exchange.

07:16.057 --> 07:17.870
What's a Floravia?

07:18.114 --> 07:20.833
Remind me to have a chat
with our Geography department.

07:22.708 --> 07:24.348
Anyways,

07:24.745 --> 07:28.526
Floravia--also known as The Land of Romance

07:28.575 --> 07:32.153
is a small but influential country
on the Mediterranean Sea.

07:32.205 --> 07:34.783
That Floravia? It's where she's from!

07:34.846 --> 07:36.275
Princess Amelia?

07:36.371 --> 07:40.284
She's all over social media.
Total fashion icon. Love her.

07:41.354 --> 07:42.574
Thank you.

07:42.996 --> 07:47.123
Out of the blue, for no apparent
reason, Floravia has offered to

07:47.147 --> 07:51.800
host a delegation of our students
to an all-expenses paid dream trip.

07:52.077 --> 07:54.437
Accompanied by your's truly, of course.

07:54.484 --> 07:57.359
This is so very... Wow!

07:57.384 --> 07:59.848
If I call your name,
you have been selected.

08:00.262 --> 08:02.301
Ken Carson!

08:02.389 --> 08:04.139
Trey Reardon!

08:05.420 --> 08:07.568
Renee Chow!

08:07.621 --> 08:09.566
Rivera!
Yes!

08:09.605 --> 08:12.113
Daisy Costopolis!
Sweet!

08:12.163 --> 08:14.476
Nikki Watkins.
Yeah!

08:14.530 --> 08:16.929
Ned and Ted Johnson!

08:17.008 --> 08:18.492
Woohoo!

08:18.571 --> 08:24.060
And the final student who will be going on
this adventure of a lifetime is

08:24.170 --> 08:25.701
Barbie Roberts!

08:25.739 --> 08:29.285
Congratulations! You're going to Floravia!

08:29.333 --> 08:34.537
Yes! yeah! This is so cool. Floravia!
Floravia here we go

08:34.609 --> 08:38.506
Can you believe it?
Our entire friend group! What are the odds?

08:38.972 --> 08:40.753
So insulting!

08:40.784 --> 08:45.222
It's like someone doesn't
even want me in this movie! Ugh!

08:45.605 --> 08:48.323
Hey, sis. I heard about the trip.
When do you leave?

08:48.331 --> 08:50.409
Soon! I barely have time to pack!

08:50.485 --> 08:53.258
No way. She called back!

08:53.305 --> 08:55.933
Who?
Rose Ross! Hello?

08:55.987 --> 09:01.003
Rose Ross? She is the biggest aggregator
of online content in the world!

09:01.149 --> 09:03.774
Oh, uh, hi Miss Ross!
Thanks for calling back!

09:03.828 --> 09:05.782
I take it you got my submission?

09:05.830 --> 09:09.048
Yes, I saw your "Try It On" video!

09:09.073 --> 09:11.294
Great stuff. Very relatable.

09:11.319 --> 09:15.161
You're just the kind of undiscovered
nobody I've been looking for.

09:15.187 --> 09:18.819
Wow! I, uh... I, uh...

09:18.859 --> 09:20.679
I know. You're speechless.

09:20.751 --> 09:23.251
Not a great trait in a vlogger.
We'll work on that.

09:23.276 --> 09:27.400
W-wait, you're serious?
You'll put my vlog on one of your channels?

09:27.453 --> 09:28.860
I do my homework.

09:28.885 --> 09:32.211
Young people today want a
role model they can believe in.

09:32.261 --> 09:35.245
Your sincere desire to help people
comes across,

09:35.270 --> 09:41.177
and I want to exploit...
I mean tap into that.

09:41.202 --> 09:43.666
This is amazing! When do I start?

09:43.702 --> 09:48.483
Slow down, there. I don't just hand
over the keys to my candy store

09:48.546 --> 09:51.179
! No, you need to prove yourself
with a test run.

09:51.204 --> 09:53.647
A test run?
To be sure we're aligned.

09:53.707 --> 09:56.386
You know, on the same page? Creatively?

09:56.411 --> 09:58.356
Well, right! That's a great idea!

09:58.403 --> 10:01.098
Oh, wait. I'm about to go on this trip.

10:01.123 --> 10:02.356
Can we start after?

10:03.288 --> 10:05.192
Rose Ross waits for no vlogger.

10:05.216 --> 10:08.851
By tomorrow, I probably will
have forgotten all about you.

10:09.432 --> 10:11.636
So, do we have a deal?

10:11.745 --> 10:14.581
Are you ready to touch the lives
of millions of people?

10:14.626 --> 10:17.173
That is my dream, but...

10:17.254 --> 10:21.222
Barbie, you don't pass up
the opportunity of a lifetime!

10:21.308 --> 10:23.042
Yes, let's do it!

10:23.113 --> 10:25.926
Starting now. We'll try it on!

10:28.222 --> 10:31.066
Welcome, old and new subscribers alike!

10:31.126 --> 10:35.079
We are streaming live from the airport
as my friends and I...

10:35.110 --> 10:39.011
Hi! Head out on the adventure
of a lifetime! Oop!

10:39.082 --> 10:40.925
I'm gonna miss you, Barbie.

10:41.007 --> 10:43.921
O-okay! More soon, bye!

10:43.968 --> 10:45.843
I'll miss you too, Chels.

10:45.901 --> 10:48.982
You're sure you have everything?
Your passport, your boarding pass?

10:49.045 --> 10:51.303
 Your neck pillow? Oh, honey.

10:51.350 --> 10:53.701
Yes, mom, I'm all set.

10:53.850 --> 10:57.538
Flight 26, 26 to Floravia is now boarding.

10:57.674 --> 11:00.822
Okay, students, that's us.

11:00.847 --> 11:02.697
Bye, mom. Bye, dad.

11:02.799 --> 11:06.697
Love you guys. Bye, Taffy. Be good.

11:06.763 --> 11:09.841
Bye. We'll miss you.
Don't eat any bad thistle berries!

11:09.939 --> 11:11.923
Bye.
Bye.

11:11.978 --> 11:13.603
Bye!
See ya.

11:13.658 --> 11:16.853
Hey, I think our seats are together.
Cool!

11:16.910 --> 11:19.293
I am gonna miss her.
So jealous.

11:19.318 --> 11:20.941
Oh, they grow up so fast.

11:23.211 --> 11:25.500
Papi! come back.

11:29.794 --> 11:33.262
Get the puppies!
DJ!

11:34.628 --> 11:35.933
Honey, get back here!

11:35.973 --> 11:37.066
Coming through!

11:44.366 --> 11:47.527
What thet--? Hey!

11:55.295 --> 11:56.764
Oh, so close!

11:56.803 --> 11:59.233
DJ, seriously?

12:01.314 --> 12:06.444
 DJ! Honey? Honey!

12:18.617 --> 12:20.468
Not funny, DJ!

12:28.735 --> 12:30.201
Don't be rude.

12:30.248 --> 12:33.405
It was taken during a very
transitional time in my life.

12:42.257 --> 12:45.960
Gotcha!
One, two, three... Where's Taffy?

12:49.294 --> 12:50.849
Ooh, here's us, Ken.

12:50.903 --> 12:52.646
10 hours side by side!

12:52.685 --> 12:54.568
We never get to spend
that much time together.

12:54.593 --> 12:58.874
Oh, uh, can I have the window Ken?
You know how I am in closed spaces.

12:58.939 --> 13:01.197
Uh, sure.

13:02.142 --> 13:04.369
Thanks.
Bye. Bye.

13:05.309 --> 13:07.460
I am so excited.

13:10.759 --> 13:13.892
I was really hoping to sit next to Barbie.

13:13.957 --> 13:16.839
There's something I gotta tell her
before this trip is over. Oh no!

13:18.678 --> 13:21.474
You okay there, Trey? This is nothing!

13:21.597 --> 13:26.058
After we take off, that's
when the motion sickness really kicks in!

13:27.671 --> 13:30.015
Flight attendants, prepare for takeoff.

13:30.190 --> 13:34.533
Hi, Rose. Now is not a great time.
We're about to take off and-

13:34.558 --> 13:35.869
Saw your livestream.

13:35.905 --> 13:41.108
Ah, um, a little "blah". Remember,
you have a much bigger audience now.

13:41.257 --> 13:46.233
You have to up your game if you wanna keep
all those new subscribers I'm giving you.

13:46.296 --> 13:47.671
Right, got it.

13:48.564 --> 13:51.885
And maybe try on a new shirt.
Or, you know, a whole new look.

13:52.076 --> 13:58.013
You're not just plain old Barbie anymore.
You need to be the all-new Barbie!

14:00.583 --> 14:04.359
You need to be the all-new Barbie!

14:06.087 --> 14:08.806
On my way to somewhere

14:08.868 --> 14:11.727
Far from my comfort zone

14:12.017 --> 14:14.830
Can I become someone?

14:15.031 --> 14:17.789
Different than I was at home?

14:17.814 --> 14:19.488
I don't know what to expect

14:19.513 --> 14:21.082
Don't know what's coming next

14:21.149 --> 14:23.829
Don't know what I'm jumping into

14:24.080 --> 14:27.955
Will I find a new me

14:28.073 --> 14:29.876
 somewhere new?

14:35.772 --> 14:38.037
Got a long list of sights to see

14:38.122 --> 14:41.060
Soaking in all this ancient history

14:41.770 --> 14:47.489
 So many trendy pop-up stores
Fresh ideas waiting there behind each door

14:47.986 --> 14:52.666
Live it up like royalty
So excited to be

14:52.804 --> 14:58.986
Somewhere new, ooh, ooh
Somewhere new, ooh, ooh

14:59.555 --> 15:02.494
Don't know what to expect
Don't know what's coming next

15:02.555 --> 15:05.430
Don't know what I'm jumping into

15:05.486 --> 15:09.369
Will I find a new me somewhere new?

15:09.421 --> 15:13.460
Re-re-remix Floravian music
Gonna drop that bass

15:13.523 --> 15:15.327
Get 'em dancing to it

15:15.352 --> 15:17.951
Adventures we've never seen before

15:18.002 --> 15:21.924
Secret alleyways I can't wait to explore

15:21.984 --> 15:28.084
Thinking maybe I can spend some time With
a certain friend of mine Somewhere new

15:28.114 --> 15:31.176
Far away from my comfort zone
Somewhere new

15:31.201 --> 15:34.201
I'll be different than I was at home
 Somewhere new

15:34.225 --> 15:37.350
Maybe this could be the thing I need
Somewhere new

15:37.386 --> 15:40.971
Just a little change of scenery
I'll be taking the step

15:40.996 --> 15:42.519
Yeah
Bring on whatever's next

15:42.545 --> 15:45.466
Yeah
No matter what I have to do

15:45.501 --> 15:49.876
I'm gonna find a new me
Are we there yet?

15:49.901 --> 15:51.520
Somewhere new

15:57.067 --> 16:00.106
A cool limo, an exotic
land, all that's missing

16:00.130 --> 16:03.036
is a government agent
on a secret mission.

16:04.254 --> 16:09.355
Taffy?! No way.
What are you doing here?

16:09.380 --> 16:11.486
Now, that's a secret agent pup.

16:11.525 --> 16:14.088
Guess you're on this adventure too.

16:15.033 --> 16:20.214
This country is amazing.
The history, the architecture...

16:22.157 --> 16:25.321
The paparazzi. What's up with that?

16:25.379 --> 16:26.730
We're approaching the palace.

16:26.817 --> 16:29.934
The press is always here,
hoping for a glimpse of the princess.

16:30.049 --> 16:31.775
That must get kinda old.

16:31.807 --> 16:34.456
Always being hounded by
people trying to take your picture.

16:34.665 --> 16:38.554
You get used to it.
I was made for the royal life.

16:41.065 --> 16:43.784
Wait, why are we turning in here?

16:43.809 --> 16:47.073
This is where we're staying!

16:51.205 --> 16:52.776
You kids, this is gonna awesome

16:52.823 --> 16:54.964
Yes. Now we are talking

16:55.817 --> 16:57.895
I never saying one.

16:58.183 --> 17:01.207
It's like, it's gonna be like
ten of my houses combined

17:10.233 --> 17:14.226
This is the most amazing place
I've ever been.

17:14.272 --> 17:16.733
I feel like I'm in a spy movie.

17:23.515 --> 17:27.374
Do I look like I'm a spy? How 'bout now?

17:28.540 --> 17:31.336
Okay, everyone, group shot!

17:32.073 --> 17:38.049
Say "adventure!" Ooh. Oh, sorry.
Hello

17:38.319 --> 17:41.866
Hello. Welcome to Floravia. I am Alfonso.

17:42.773 --> 17:48.038
The royal adviser to her Highness,
Princess Amelia. Please, follow me.

17:49.062 --> 17:52.737
You heard the handsome man!
What are you waiting for?

18:01.632 --> 18:04.965
Please enjoy all the
ammenities the palace has

18:04.989 --> 18:08.322
to offer, and, of course,
24-hour room service.

18:08.442 --> 18:12.356
24-hour room service?

18:15.674 --> 18:17.948
Is the princess here now?
Will we get to see her?

18:17.980 --> 18:19.902
Would love to talk fashion.

18:20.255 --> 18:22.810
For security reasons,
I can neither confirm

18:22.834 --> 18:25.816
nor deny the whereabouts
of her Royal Highness.

18:25.841 --> 18:28.924
I must insist that you respect her privacy.

18:28.964 --> 18:31.823
The west wing is strictly off-limits.

18:32.193 --> 18:35.140
Told you. Spy movie.

18:36.703 --> 18:41.173
Now, if you will follow me,
I will escort you to your rooms.

18:51.641 --> 18:55.363
Taffy! We're not supposed to go that way.

18:59.646 --> 19:05.938
Taffy!
Sorry!

19:06.944 --> 19:08.194
Ugh, tourists!

19:12.107 --> 19:14.091
No, don't go in there!

19:14.773 --> 19:16.163
Taffy!

19:16.640 --> 19:18.711
Wow.

19:23.251 --> 19:26.939
Got you! What are you trying to do,
get me in trouble?

19:27.053 --> 19:30.092
You know indoor bunnies aren't chew toys.

19:31.217 --> 19:32.741
I see you've met Snowy.

19:35.950 --> 19:38.888
I am so sorry about this, your Highness!

19:39.231 --> 19:41.699
It is "your Highness", right?

19:41.838 --> 19:43.666
You can call me Amelia, Barbie.

19:43.671 --> 19:47.437
Amelia. Cool. Wait. You know me?

19:47.561 --> 19:52.664
I loved that "Try It On" song.
Your sisters are so cute. Hi, Taffy!

19:53.341 --> 19:55.012
You watch my vlog?

19:55.096 --> 19:57.770
As often as I can, but,
you know, when you're a

19:57.794 --> 20:00.468
princess, your schedule
gets pretty complicated.

20:00.575 --> 20:03.950
Your Highness!
I'm so sorry for the interruption.

20:04.056 --> 20:07.618
She got away from me and ...
It's fine, Alfonso. Just give us a minute?

20:08.008 --> 20:11.656
As you wish... but remember,
you have an early day tomorrow.

20:11.758 --> 20:14.250
I know. I'll be ready. Thank you.

20:17.515 --> 20:19.093
Is he always like that?

20:19.163 --> 20:23.288
He means well, but I just wish, for once,
he would trust me.

20:23.369 --> 20:26.009
Let me make my own mistakes.
The way you do.

20:26.339 --> 20:29.696
Thanks?
Oh, uh, you know what I mean.

20:29.801 --> 20:33.090
All those funny stories about your life
that you tell on your vlog?

20:33.159 --> 20:36.198
They inspire people.
I wish I could do that.

20:36.223 --> 20:38.480
You do! I mean, you must!

20:38.619 --> 20:41.690
You have millions of followers.
People love you.

20:41.744 --> 20:46.693
The world loves my image,
but is that image really me?

20:46.764 --> 20:47.850
What do you mean?

20:47.875 --> 20:52.657
Pretty much every picture you see online
has been planned out, staged, retouched...

20:52.827 --> 20:56.311
I never get to post pictures of me
just hanging out, looking goofy.

20:58.815 --> 21:04.015
Well, you always look so glamorous.
I just assumed that was your life.

21:04.107 --> 21:08.622
Parts of it are... and I'm so grateful
but it's a lot of pressure, too.

21:08.784 --> 21:12.229
So many times I feel
I'm just playing a role for the cameras...

21:12.277 --> 21:16.581
And the real Amelia?
No one knows her. Not even me.

21:21.828 --> 21:24.891
You might think I have everything

21:24.983 --> 21:27.433
A girl could ever want

21:27.703 --> 21:30.539
A palace full of luxury

21:30.564 --> 21:33.087
And helpers who help 'round the clock

21:33.329 --> 21:36.500
Looking out through royal walls

21:36.539 --> 21:39.215
With every minute planned

21:39.429 --> 21:41.836
What I'd give to have the chance

21:42.055 --> 21:44.383
To hold my future in my own hands

21:44.415 --> 21:47.703
All they know is from a screen

21:47.786 --> 21:51.427
So how can I become their queen?

21:51.469 --> 21:55.040
I wanna be me

21:55.097 --> 22:00.623
And make my own decisions
I wanna be free

22:00.676 --> 22:03.277
To chase my own ambitions

22:03.313 --> 22:06.500
I wanna go anywhere
Feel the wind in my hair

22:06.539 --> 22:10.047
And find myself out there in this world

22:10.072 --> 22:14.526
I wanna be me, and not
a picture perfect girl

22:14.565 --> 22:19.410
Everybody needs to feel alive

22:19.675 --> 22:25.036
Yeah, everyone deserves a chance
to live outside the lines

22:25.061 --> 22:28.784
But princesses can't be seen
breaking the rules You're a princess;

22:28.846 --> 22:32.931
you should be making the rules
I wanna be me

22:32.956 --> 22:37.222
You gotta be free
And make my own decisions

22:37.242 --> 22:40.582
I wanna be free
Let the world see

22:40.630 --> 22:43.067
Unfiltered, nothing missing

22:43.129 --> 22:46.942
I wanna go anywhere
Feel the wind in my hair , ooh, yeah

22:46.974 --> 22:50.060
And find myself out there
In this world

22:50.102 --> 22:53.094
I wanna be me
you gotta be free

22:53.139 --> 22:57.583
I'm gonna be me, not a picture perfect girl

23:05.514 --> 23:11.264
Isn't it crazy how I can do whatever
I want on my vlog, but nobody is listening

23:11.642 --> 23:15.821
while you have the eyes
and the ears of the entire world?

23:15.877 --> 23:17.416
But can't say anything.

23:17.680 --> 23:21.565
I so desperately wanna scream out,
I have opinions, too!

23:21.885 --> 23:26.315
but Alfonso won't let me.
He thinks no one wants to know the real me

23:26.521 --> 23:31.278
and I need to know if he's right.
That's why I arranged to meet you.

23:31.552 --> 23:33.349
What?
The field trip?

23:33.746 --> 23:36.662
Didn't you think it was odd that
only your friends got invited?

23:36.778 --> 23:40.575
The ones who've been on your vlog?
I set the whole thing up so we could meet.

23:40.609 --> 23:44.003
What? Why?
You have to see the resemblance.

23:44.367 --> 23:47.666
Here, look at our reflection.

23:50.394 --> 23:57.035
Take down your hair.
Uh, okay. OMG!

24:00.588 --> 24:03.752
I noticed it the minute
I saw you in that wig on your vlog.

24:03.924 --> 24:07.564
Barbie, let's switch places.
You're kidding.

24:09.564 --> 24:12.892
You're not kidding.
Not forever! Just for this week.

24:13.053 --> 24:16.671
Once I become queen, my whole life
will get even more controlled.

24:16.707 --> 24:18.792
I'll never have this chance again.

24:18.853 --> 24:23.751
Your Highness...Amelia...besides the fact
that it's pretty crazy,

24:23.849 --> 24:25.402
, I've got this
huge opportunity.

24:25.426 --> 24:28.642
I'm supposed to be doing something
new and different on my vlog,

24:28.681 --> 24:32.103
and I'm kinda freaking out about
it already. Then I can help!

24:32.154 --> 24:34.782
I can give you the eyes
of the world, if you give

24:34.806 --> 24:38.454
me the chance to
experience life without them.

24:38.965 --> 24:44.347
Hmm... after this, would you do
a vlog post with me?

24:44.382 --> 24:48.080
We could talk about the experience;
what we learned by switching places.

24:48.214 --> 24:51.985
That would be an amazing story.
Yes, I love that idea.

24:52.090 --> 24:56.048
So, will you do it?
Let's do it. Yay!

24:57.898 --> 25:02.172
I can't believe we're doing this.
My friends will never believe it.

25:02.222 --> 25:05.356
But don't tell anyone else, okay?
Until after.

25:05.501 --> 25:08.009
We need to keep this our little secret.

25:10.922 --> 25:15.633
You met the princess? That's crazy.

25:15.761 --> 25:20.480
What's she like?
I know one thing: she has amazing taste.

25:20.647 --> 25:23.489
Okay, uh, can we go back
to the "taking her place"

25:23.513 --> 25:26.238
part, 'cause that sounds
more fun than crazy!

25:26.309 --> 25:29.411
Right? Something inside me said
I should do this thing.

25:29.552 --> 25:33.416
I mean, how often do you get to
walk in someone else's shoes?

25:33.455 --> 25:39.879
And not just any shoes! Come on!

25:40.087 --> 25:43.993
If this is something you wanna do,
Barbie, we're here for you.

25:44.048 --> 25:47.938
You guys are the best... but you can't
tell anyone until after we switch back.

25:48.143 --> 25:52.079
She texted me a list of all the things I'm
supposed to do this week, starting with...

25:52.121 --> 25:55.441
A pre-coronation party on a yacht!

25:55.851 --> 25:59.866
Wait, a party on a yacht? So fun!

26:10.504 --> 26:13.793
Stay down, Snowy.
We'll be outta here in just a ...

26:13.831 --> 26:17.027
May I help you?
Oh, um...

26:17.109 --> 26:21.251
Oh, excuse me, miss; I thought you were...
someone else. Pardon me.

26:23.860 --> 26:28.375
Woo, we even fooled.
This is gonna work out great.

26:37.257 --> 26:42.444
What?! Uh...

26:42.657 --> 26:46.892
So, we're going to to Thistleberry Museum.
It's the national food of Floravia.

26:46.958 --> 26:51.122
Who could miss that? Not us! Come on!
But-- whoa!

26:53.068 --> 26:55.640
What? Where did everybody go?

27:22.893 --> 27:25.924
Princess! How do you feel about
two kingdoms coming together?

27:25.952 --> 27:26.967
Over here!
Princess!

27:27.038 --> 27:29.835
How about being the youngest
queen of Floravia ever!

27:30.221 --> 27:33.986
What do you have to say
to the citizens of Johanistan?

27:34.093 --> 27:36.367
Oh, uh--whoa!

27:39.449 --> 27:40.715
Is she ok?

27:43.749 --> 27:46.474
She meant to do that!
Ha, totally!

27:50.630 --> 27:54.279
Princess, you look amazing!
Over here, princess!

28:19.968 --> 28:23.398
Hello.
Oh, your Highness. My apologies.

28:23.922 --> 28:28.289
Did you see that? So cool.
You're killing it, Barbie.

28:28.314 --> 28:31.821
I'm pretending we're undercover,
keeping a huge secret.

28:31.846 --> 28:35.367
We are, and so far, so good. Now what?

28:35.431 --> 28:39.399
No clue. Princess Amelia said to
just smile and enjoy...

28:39.424 --> 28:42.758
and at all costs, avoid running into...
Amelia!

28:42.783 --> 28:45.413
There you are!
I've been looking all over for you!

28:45.459 --> 28:48.873
So good to see you!
Uh...

28:48.908 --> 28:52.388
Quit playing. It's me, Prince Johan!

28:52.527 --> 28:58.349
Hi there, Johan.
You haven't changed either, I think.

28:58.456 --> 29:02.024
Don't you love her sense of humor?
Come, let's catch up.

29:12.947 --> 29:15.384
So, how do you like your party?

29:15.409 --> 29:17.319
Getting my yacht here was not easy.

29:18.193 --> 29:21.952
Your yacht?
Well, you know how it is.

29:22.019 --> 29:26.031
Technically, it belongs to my
kingdom but, now with the whole "our

29:26.055 --> 29:30.563
countries are about to become one"
thing, my yacht is your yacht! Haha!

29:31.305 --> 29:35.032
Yes, I totally know how that is
because I'm the princess.

29:35.143 --> 29:37.081
About to be queen!

29:38.380 --> 29:41.584
What was that that you used to
say when we were kids?

29:41.623 --> 29:44.224
The first thing we'd do as rulers?

29:44.360 --> 29:48.774
Uh...
Come on, you remember...

29:50.878 --> 29:53.941
Hey, I love this song! Why don't we dance?

29:53.989 --> 29:57.614
You are hilarious.
You know I'm not much of a-- whoa!

30:06.794 --> 30:09.247
Look, she's dancing with Prince Johan!

30:09.561 --> 30:14.443
Over here princes, over here.
Over here, over here

30:18.413 --> 30:19.617
Photobomb!

30:21.562 --> 30:27.965
To the left, to the left...
more to the left.

30:36.345 --> 30:37.907
That was so much fun!

30:38.109 --> 30:40.660
Well, except for maybe
the getting mobbed by

30:40.684 --> 30:43.235
paparazzi part, but
even that was kinda cool!

30:43.283 --> 30:46.136
You sure fooled them,
 and that prince dude, too.

30:46.348 --> 30:49.723
Yeah, this is totally gonna work.

30:49.998 --> 30:52.662
A word... Barbie?

30:58.239 --> 30:59.856
How did you find out?

30:59.909 --> 31:02.356
Aside from the fact I
know everything there

31:02.380 --> 31:05.179
is to know about her
Highness, there was this.

31:05.258 --> 31:09.398
"Prince and princess caught dancing
with bigfoot?" What?

31:09.571 --> 31:13.680
Not that.
My necklace...

31:13.939 --> 31:17.174
I was able to remove this story
from the press pool...

31:17.279 --> 31:19.951
with any luck,
I was the only person to see it.

31:20.292 --> 31:23.178
Now do you understand
why it is so important for

31:23.202 --> 31:26.089
me to keep control of
the situation at all times?

31:26.440 --> 31:29.463
So tell me, where is Amelia?

31:29.955 --> 31:34.806
I'm really sorry, but I don't know.
Very well. I will find her.

31:35.020 --> 31:40.644
Until then, you will keep up this charade..
under my watch. Starting now.

31:40.918 --> 31:42.324
The necklace...

31:52.421 --> 31:54.655
Come on, come on. pick up!

31:55.746 --> 31:59.478
Hey, Barbie.
Amelia, we need to talk. Alfonso knows!

31:59.499 --> 32:02.178
That's Alfonso; always
such a stick in the mud.

32:02.257 --> 32:04.631
He said I need to keep this up
until he finds you.

32:04.656 --> 32:08.225
That's great, because he won't find me.
I'm really good at hiding.

32:08.327 --> 32:11.491
Are you sure?
Your coronation is in a few days.

32:11.598 --> 32:13.676
Don't worry;
I'll be back in plenty of times.

32:13.701 --> 32:15.802
Okay, I gotta go.
But ...

32:20.754 --> 32:24.317
Rose, hi!
So, what have you got for me?

32:24.376 --> 32:27.899
Millions of new subscribers are just
waiting to come on board.

32:27.924 --> 32:32.382
I do have something big.
Huge, in fact, but I can't share it yet.

32:32.422 --> 32:35.531
Then it doesn't count.
Pics or it didn't happen.

32:35.556 --> 32:38.275
No pressure...
but there's a lot of pressure.

32:38.338 --> 32:43.258
We've got a ginormous sponsor on the hook.
They make designer headphones.

32:43.345 --> 32:48.764
The rumors about them being dangerous?
Total conspiracy theory.

32:53.577 --> 32:57.179
Okay, get me something amazing! Bye.

32:58.214 --> 33:02.423
Barbie, you there? Taffy needed to go,
so I took her for-- whoa.

33:05.108 --> 33:06.670
You look amazing.

33:06.884 --> 33:10.627
Thanks. Good to see you, too.
How was your night?

33:10.673 --> 33:12.486
Not as interesting as your's, apparently.

33:12.547 --> 33:17.452
Yeah, I should probably tell you something,
but you can't tell anyone else, okay?

33:17.542 --> 33:19.789
You know I've got your back, always.

33:25.109 --> 33:27.047
What's going on here today? 
She's still sleeping

33:27.079 --> 33:29.477
What? What is it?

33:30.630 --> 33:32.427
Can someone get her some water?

33:32.663 --> 33:35.501
Rise and shine. The staff will prepare you.

33:35.647 --> 33:39.537
You've got a busy day. We've got to
get you into your riding attire.

33:39.965 --> 33:44.245
Hold still, your Highness. I'll just
sprinkle a little color right here...

33:44.625 --> 33:49.853
A royal horse show? Seriously?
It's supposed to be cool.

33:52.735 --> 33:55.231
Whoa. Look at this place.

33:55.407 --> 33:58.689
Meet Morning Star,
the princess' personal horse.

34:01.533 --> 34:07.090
She's beautiful. Oh, did I upset her?

34:07.160 --> 34:09.074
I'm usually pretty good with horses.

34:09.099 --> 34:13.572
She's a bit, uh, sensitive.
You can ride, can't you?

34:13.597 --> 34:15.101
I love to ride.

34:18.462 --> 34:21.696
The princess' bond with
Morning Star is world-renowned.

34:21.731 --> 34:25.920
If she doesn't appear today,
the press will know something is wrong,

34:25.958 --> 34:28.543
and with only two days
to 'til the coronation...

34:28.617 --> 34:32.993
I get it.
It's really important I pull this off.

34:33.764 --> 34:35.108
Thank you.

34:37.022 --> 34:39.436
Hey there, Morning Star. Sup?

34:47.245 --> 34:49.518
Right this way, ladies and gentlemen.

34:52.174 --> 34:56.768
You all remember Morning Star,
but where is our princess?

34:56.893 --> 34:59.565
Here, I'm here. Ready to go.

35:01.330 --> 35:03.205
Over here, princess!
That's beautiful.

35:03.245 --> 35:05.065
Wow, princess, you look great.

35:05.112 --> 35:08.376
We'll see you after the show,
your Highness.

35:10.250 --> 35:13.845
Okay, so you know
I'm not the real princess,

35:14.027 --> 35:16.090
but she really needs us to pull this off.

35:17.515 --> 35:19.886
Please help me, for her sake?

35:28.272 --> 35:29.537
 Thank you.

35:30.116 --> 35:33.139
Ladies and gentlemen,
please take your seats.

35:33.187 --> 35:37.749
The presentation of the royal horse
brigade is about to begin.

35:38.942 --> 35:41.891
Ugh. No w...
Huh?

35:55.132 --> 35:57.117
Thanks again for helping me.

36:05.675 --> 36:09.433
Come on, we got this. For Amelia.

36:14.003 --> 36:16.174
Hey, isn't that Barbie?

36:16.206 --> 36:17.495
Don't be ridiculous.

36:35.434 --> 36:36.739
Wow!

37:02.620 --> 37:03.777
Wonderful!

37:12.731 --> 37:14.723
You did well at the horse brigade,

37:14.835 --> 37:17.124
but there's no time to rest
on your laurels.

37:17.264 --> 37:19.701
Next is the palace photo
shoot, then the royal

37:19.725 --> 37:22.162
orphanage tour, then
the dress fitting, and

37:22.230 --> 37:24.496
You could've given me a
head's up that the schedule

37:24.520 --> 37:26.786
would be so crazy! I
might've been able to help.

37:27.132 --> 37:30.358
A good princess does not
bother herself with details.

37:30.433 --> 37:31.721
Leave those to me.

37:31.861 --> 37:36.033
You just show up, be gorgeous,
and make it all look effortless.

37:36.349 --> 37:41.686
But it's not effortless. It takes so
much work to pull all this stuff off.

37:41.997 --> 37:45.724
it only looks easy because
Amelia is so good at it.

37:46.248 --> 37:48.428
You need to give her more credit.
But I ...

37:48.475 --> 37:51.084
And you know what else?
You should listen to her.

37:51.116 --> 37:53.070
I was just protecting her.

37:53.124 --> 37:56.372
You're stopping her from learning
how to make her own decisions.

37:56.482 --> 37:58.326
But she's just a young girl.

37:58.421 --> 38:01.234
One with great ideas and dreams.

38:01.328 --> 38:03.664
Have you ever even asked her what they are?

38:04.661 --> 38:07.523
I... I... I do not appreciate
being spoken to this way.

38:07.537 --> 38:10.009
I don't mean to be disrespectful.

38:10.202 --> 38:13.522
I just get really worked up when
my friends aren't being heard.

38:13.590 --> 38:17.114
Every word she utters is heard...
by the whole world.

38:17.323 --> 38:21.170
That is why she must be perfect
at all times. Cameras are everywhere!

38:21.306 --> 38:24.025
Then maybe it's time to
put down the cameras,

38:24.050 --> 38:25.952
and see what's right in front of you.

38:26.311 --> 38:28.780
Life doesn't happen on camera;

38:28.937 --> 38:31.210
life is what happens
when the cameras are off.

38:35.462 --> 38:37.681
Your Highness,
will you take a selfie with me?

38:37.735 --> 38:41.127
Tell you what, I've got a better idea.

39:01.067 --> 39:04.151
We don't have to film this

39:04.736 --> 39:08.753
'Cause we don't wanna miss the memories

39:08.799 --> 39:11.033
We're finding our own way

39:11.899 --> 39:14.633
Writing our own stories

39:14.743 --> 39:17.016
I wanna paint the sky

39:18.063 --> 39:20.735
With all the shades of life

39:21.492 --> 39:25.169
I'm gonna take a stand

39:25.240 --> 39:28.178
If it's wrong or right

39:28.638 --> 39:33.257
Don't you know that black and
white's for classic movies?

39:33.315 --> 39:36.428
You won't just find a happy ending

39:36.542 --> 39:42.167
You live your own adventure
So make it colorful

39:43.039 --> 39:47.461
We're living life in color

39:47.565 --> 39:50.385
Looking beyond the mirror

39:50.504 --> 39:54.727
'Cause life in color

39:54.985 --> 40:01.035
Is so much clearer
Now we're bright, feeling confident

40:01.074 --> 40:05.074
So bold, there's no stopping it

40:05.160 --> 40:11.509
Life in color

40:12.116 --> 40:14.967
No more holding back

40:15.473 --> 40:18.918
Yeah, we're taking chances

40:19.016 --> 40:26.136
Learning it's okay
To leap without a landing

40:26.161 --> 40:29.144
Your truth will lift you up

40:29.704 --> 40:33.179
When you think you're falling

40:33.244 --> 40:36.088
'Cause once you find your voice

40:36.143 --> 40:38.956
You'll keep the doubt from calling

40:38.997 --> 40:43.472
Don't you know that black and
white's for classic movies?

40:43.551 --> 40:46.736
You won't just find a happy ending

40:46.813 --> 40:52.822
You live your own adventure
So make it colorful

40:53.102 --> 40:57.695
We're living life in color

40:57.887 --> 41:00.596
Looking beyond the mirror

41:00.699 --> 41:04.801
'Cause life in color

41:05.093 --> 41:11.163
Is so much clearer
Now we're bright, feeling confident

41:11.230 --> 41:15.006
So bold, there's no stopping it

41:15.079 --> 41:21.391
Life in color

41:21.920 --> 41:27.568
Yeah

41:29.354 --> 41:36.050
Life in color

41:37.037 --> 41:38.576
Wow!

41:48.621 --> 41:53.342
Barbie! Amelia. Hey.
I had such an amazing day.

41:53.448 --> 41:57.862
Me too! Exhausting, but amazing.
How do you do it?

41:57.911 --> 42:00.099
I have a lot of help.
I noticed.

42:00.499 --> 42:04.124
Is it always like that?
So many people every moment?

42:04.239 --> 42:06.559
Watched, planned, perfected.

42:06.737 --> 42:10.774
Every word I say is scripted and
controlled, but not today.

42:10.865 --> 42:15.239
Today I was just me.
The real me! And people liked me.

42:15.298 --> 42:17.947
I even got to choose my own
flavor of ice cream.

42:17.972 --> 42:19.962
It was so liberating!

42:20.021 --> 42:22.560
I just wish I could share this
feeling with everyone.

42:22.701 --> 42:25.553
You can! Are you ready to do the interview?

42:25.677 --> 42:28.043
I won't post it until we after
we swap back, but I find that

42:28.067 --> 42:32.625
speaking when your heart is
bursting with emotion and new ideas?

42:32.883 --> 42:35.852
That makes the best posts.
Let's do it.

42:36.010 --> 42:39.768
Just look into the camera,
and tell me what you have to say.

42:41.353 --> 42:48.137
Hi! I have a very special guest today.
Meet the new queen of Floravia!

42:48.316 --> 42:50.628
Hi... but it's just Amelia.

42:50.763 --> 42:55.341
Amelia noticed that we kinda looked alike,
so we did this amazing thing.

42:55.542 --> 42:59.386
I got to live her life as a princess,
and she got to live...

42:59.433 --> 43:03.912
well, not like a princess.
What was it like switching places, Amelia?

43:04.801 --> 43:08.714
Well, for the first time in my life,
I feel I can share the real me.

43:08.783 --> 43:12.609
I learned I am so much more than
what people see in my photos.

43:12.690 --> 43:16.074
I have opinions, and dreams,
and fears,like you.

43:16.175 --> 43:20.863
And my favorite scoop of ice cream?
All of them.

43:21.524 --> 43:26.128
What else do you have to say?
So much.

43:27.927 --> 43:30.785
The fashion scene in Floravia is fierce!

43:30.856 --> 43:32.841
This is going to be
the highlight of my trip.

43:32.888 --> 43:35.638
Shopping!

43:36.856 --> 43:39.133
I've always wanted to ride
one of these things...

43:39.216 --> 43:42.048
go on an exciting chase like
they do in spy movies!

43:46.606 --> 43:48.059
Ugh, tourists!

43:49.967 --> 43:52.099
Well, that was the shortest spy movie ever.

43:54.178 --> 43:55.420
Can't you come with us?

43:55.513 --> 43:59.811
Uh-uh. Alfonso says I have to attend
coronation practice with Johan.

44:00.078 --> 44:03.070
There's some folk dance I'm supposed
to learn... See you after?

44:03.329 --> 44:05.947
Sure!
So what are we eating today?

44:06.032 --> 44:08.946
I don't know. I was thinking you knew
what we were gonna eat today.

44:09.638 --> 44:13.286
Since when do you know the princess?
Uh...

44:13.470 --> 44:17.025
It was Barbie.
Pfft, Barbie... As if!

44:17.126 --> 44:19.774
Carson, you gotta introduce
me to the princess.

44:20.124 --> 44:23.638
Ugh, seriously Trey?
She ... you ... it's not

44:23.722 --> 44:26.784
I can see it now:
Ruling the land together.

44:26.872 --> 44:29.872
Her, me... but mostly me.

44:29.929 --> 44:32.530
Ugh, give it up, Trey.
It's not gonna happen.

44:32.661 --> 44:36.392
Why not? I'm getting pretty tired
of everyone telling me

44:36.417 --> 44:38.565
me I'm not "royal enough.

44:38.636 --> 44:39.964
I'm Trey Reardon!

44:40.011 --> 44:43.159
If anyone deserves to be king, it's me!

44:43.866 --> 44:46.366
If I ruled the world

44:46.534 --> 44:48.230
I would kick it up a notch

44:48.262 --> 44:50.655
King Trey the 1st

44:50.680 --> 44:52.575
Leading with my chiseled jaw

44:52.596 --> 44:55.758
Ruling like it's never been done

44:55.803 --> 44:59.783
If I was king
King, king, king

44:59.937 --> 45:01.538
King, king of the kingdom

45:01.563 --> 45:03.656
Dom, dom, dom

45:03.671 --> 45:07.891
King of the kingdom
Dom, dom, dom

45:09.373 --> 45:11.459
I'd begin my kingly day

45:11.498 --> 45:13.654
Taking selfies on my throne

45:13.693 --> 45:15.654
I would have a royal guard

45:15.756 --> 45:18.123
Be in charge of charging my phone

45:18.160 --> 45:20.222
Getting spoon fed gelato

45:20.247 --> 45:21.940
Scoop it up, that's my motto

45:21.977 --> 45:24.438
And every ice cream truck
would have my face

45:24.744 --> 45:26.033
That's right

45:26.075 --> 45:28.262
If I ruled the world

45:28.387 --> 45:30.738
You know I'd do it right, yeah

45:30.763 --> 45:32.669
I'd be the first

45:32.694 --> 45:34.718
To livestream my royal life

45:34.758 --> 45:38.078
Ever seen a king so handsome?

45:38.140 --> 45:41.617
If I was king
King, king, king

45:41.965 --> 45:45.754
King, king of the kingdom
Dom, dom, dom

45:45.800 --> 45:49.967
King, king of the kingdom
Dom, dom, dom

45:51.465 --> 45:53.449
Filming funny prank videos

45:53.487 --> 45:55.730
With other foreign leaders

45:55.755 --> 45:57.604
I'd royally cut the line

45:57.645 --> 45:59.965
For limited edition sneakers

45:59.990 --> 46:04.169
Host a big celebration
To unite the nation

46:04.224 --> 46:08.658
Yeah, a music festival in my name
Treychella

46:08.683 --> 46:12.327
I'd be there for the people
Spend time with friends and family

46:12.619 --> 46:17.161
Everybody be equal
-ly a fan of me,

46:17.239 --> 46:23.872
 yeah... no?

46:24.185 --> 46:28.810
Dom, dom, dom
King of the kingdom

46:28.901 --> 46:30.737
Dom, dom, dom

46:30.779 --> 46:32.978
Long live the king
If I was king

46:33.013 --> 46:37.591
King, king, king
King, king of the kingdom

46:52.348 --> 46:54.676
Okay, getting there. Ready to go again?

46:54.770 --> 46:59.039
How about a break?
We've been at this a while, and ...

46:59.078 --> 47:00.309
Whoa!

47:03.049 --> 47:06.003
I thought you didn't like to dance.

47:06.080 --> 47:10.010
I don't, but this one's just so...
important.

47:11.450 --> 47:16.012
It's not just a dance; it reenacts the
treaty between our two countries.

47:16.070 --> 47:19.952
Right, I knew that. Whoa! Whoa!

47:20.948 --> 47:23.635
When we perform it
at the coronation, it will

47:23.659 --> 47:26.346
formalize my country
surrending to your's.

47:26.957 --> 47:28.136
 Grr!

47:28.199 --> 47:32.129
No pressure, right? Grr!

47:34.688 --> 47:37.930
Then, when you're crowned queen,
the countries will unite.

47:39.395 --> 47:45.168
One, two, three...
One, two, three...

47:46.731 --> 47:50.122
You win... Ugh!

47:54.041 --> 47:57.447
We'll become one, big, happy family...

47:57.551 --> 47:59.137
and you will rule us all.

47:59.162 --> 48:04.818
Oh, I, uh, have to go check on
something else.

48:09.848 --> 48:17.067
Hmm, not bad. Much better.

48:19.193 --> 48:24.516
Go on, she's gonna need all the friends
she can get once I become king.

48:28.063 --> 48:30.563
When I rule the world

48:30.610 --> 48:32.688
There'll be a different dance

48:32.751 --> 48:34.689
I got a thirst

48:34.714 --> 48:37.001
For a little change of plans

48:37.041 --> 48:40.299
I'll do whatever needs to be done

48:40.526 --> 48:45.114
'Til I'm king, king, king, king, king!

48:45.267 --> 48:48.375
King of the kingdom.

48:53.160 --> 48:56.019
So cute. I love animals. Oh!

49:02.104 --> 49:05.143
Roberts? Of course it would be you.

49:05.795 --> 49:09.038
Uh, right. I'm Barbie,
and you're my friends.

49:09.092 --> 49:12.186
We're better friends.
Way better.

49:14.996 --> 49:17.168
Make yourself useful and take a picture.

49:25.273 --> 49:26.297
Cut it out!

49:27.443 --> 49:31.888
So, uh, this has been fun,
but I really need to go after my rabbit.

49:31.913 --> 49:33.028
See you round.

49:33.831 --> 49:36.933
Typical Roberts. When did she get a rabbit?

49:37.831 --> 49:39.487
Snowy?

49:41.424 --> 49:43.292
There you are.

49:49.655 --> 49:54.628
Hey, what is this?! Let me go! Help! Help!

49:57.087 --> 50:00.118
Huh, weird.
What's weird?

50:00.181 --> 50:02.128
You mean the auto-foot washer
in the bathroom?

50:02.159 --> 50:04.128
It's pretty cool once
you find the right setting.

50:04.153 --> 50:05.878
My feet have never been cleaner.

50:06.441 --> 50:08.371
Uh, no, not that.

50:08.529 --> 50:11.044
The princess isn't answering her phone.

50:11.069 --> 50:14.887
She's probably having too much fun.
Floravia's a great place to explore.

50:15.009 --> 50:17.431
I wish you could've been there today.
Me too.

50:17.507 --> 50:19.342
This princess thing has been fun,

50:19.367 --> 50:22.211
but so much more overwhelming
than I ever imagined.

50:22.427 --> 50:25.794
To be honest,
I'm kind of looking forward to going home.

50:26.107 --> 50:28.318
Home... right...

50:28.617 --> 50:31.902
So, Barbie, before this trip is over,

50:31.927 --> 50:34.137
I kind of wanted to talk to
you about something.

50:34.276 --> 50:36.721
Yes?
I, uh...

50:36.746 --> 50:39.182
Did someone say "slumber party?"

50:39.252 --> 50:42.213
Wow! Ah!

50:42.490 --> 50:44.256
Surprise!

50:44.281 --> 50:48.598
Aw, you guys are the best.
Your pajamas are adorable!

50:48.622 --> 50:50.825
Told you the shopping in Floravia
was amazing!

50:50.853 --> 50:53.603
Wish you could've been there.
What did you do today, Barbie?

50:53.642 --> 50:55.947
Well, I got to dance with the prince.

50:56.118 --> 50:58.688
What was that like?
Awkward.

51:01.997 --> 51:06.645
What was that?!

51:10.803 --> 51:14.021
Snowy?
It's a secret passageway!

51:15.644 --> 51:17.871
I think he wants us to follow him.

51:18.042 --> 51:20.518
Uh, I'll just wait out here.

51:20.727 --> 51:23.594
Come on, Renee! You wanted to be a spy!

51:26.073 --> 51:31.017
Uh, not if it means going into
tiny dark spaces! Ahh!

51:43.778 --> 51:47.177
Okay, I'm, uh, done being a spy!
We can go back now!

51:50.209 --> 51:54.115
Look! A light! Or not. Ahh!

52:00.026 --> 52:02.112
Whoa!

52:02.398 --> 52:06.609
This is where I met the princess!
It's her secret hangout room.

52:08.736 --> 52:10.613
What is it, Snowy? Where is she?

52:10.638 --> 52:13.996
Ugh, can you believe we have to do this?
Quick, hide!

52:14.254 --> 52:15.778
Ow!

52:18.606 --> 52:22.426
I need my bunny" Spoiled brat.

52:22.451 --> 52:25.470
We should pretend we couldn't find it.
That would teach her a lesson.

52:25.524 --> 52:27.509
You know we can't leave any loose ends.

52:27.548 --> 52:29.993
Right... hurry up and find the silly thing.

52:41.185 --> 52:42.700
There it is!

52:46.118 --> 52:50.852
Let's go. Ow!

52:50.944 --> 52:54.210
That was close.
They took Snowy. Not good.

52:54.296 --> 52:56.233
The princess is in trouble.

52:58.944 --> 53:02.842
So, everyone know the plan? We finish
getting dressed for the coronation...

53:02.867 --> 53:04.508
And act like nothing's wrong.

53:04.533 --> 53:06.485
Then we split up, and
look for the princess.

53:06.518 --> 53:08.705
We'll take the scooters,
and search the city.

53:08.730 --> 53:11.432
And I'll find Alfonso and
see what he knows.

53:11.476 --> 53:13.391
Be careful.
I will be.

53:13.423 --> 53:17.016
We can't let the coronation happen
without Princess Amelia.

53:17.526 --> 53:20.909
Why is being a spy so much
more scary when it's real?

53:26.033 --> 53:29.048
Rose! Hey! Now is not a good time.

53:29.116 --> 53:33.398
Now is the perfect time!
Your first post is about to go live!

53:33.453 --> 53:36.017
Wait, you weren't supposed
to post that until after

53:36.042 --> 53:39.556
It was fabulous! Oh,
once my team zhuzhed it.

53:39.596 --> 53:41.401
"Zhuzhed it"? How?

53:41.468 --> 53:43.882
A few tweaks. Here, see for yourself.

53:44.680 --> 53:47.390
.] "Meet the new queen of Floravia."

53:47.415 --> 53:49.445
You can call me Your Highness!

53:50.410 --> 53:52.894
And my favorite scoop?
Today I was perfected

53:53.174 --> 53:55.430
"That's awesome!"
People liked me.

53:55.501 --> 53:56.540
"Bow to the queen!"

53:57.941 --> 54:01.129
"Every word I say sold me."
"Huge!"

54:01.162 --> 54:05.114
I watched everyone for
the first time in my life,

54:05.139 --> 54:07.661
I learned I am so much more
than you people.

54:08.507 --> 54:10.804
"Right?"
"Looking gorgeous!"

54:11.897 --> 54:13.437
"Totally."
"Yep."

54:15.532 --> 54:19.063
Rose, I...
Love it? I know.

54:19.137 --> 54:21.794
I don't! That's not my post.

54:22.045 --> 54:26.560
Those aren't our words! Well, they are
but you changed them all around!

54:26.625 --> 54:31.029
Great, right?
The latest editing software is amazing!

54:31.061 --> 54:34.256
It can make you say
absolutely anything I want!

54:34.288 --> 54:35.710
What about what I want?

54:35.735 --> 54:38.608
I thought reaching millions of fans
was your dream?

54:38.710 --> 54:41.678
Not if it means speaking
with somebody else's words

54:41.773 --> 54:44.539
! I promised the princess
she could be herself.

54:44.564 --> 54:47.859
This makes me no better than
anyone else who's controlled her!

54:47.911 --> 54:51.145
You made me look so... shallow!

54:51.218 --> 54:54.210
"Shallow?!" I made you look like a star!

54:54.235 --> 54:57.257
And that's how it has to be if
you wanna play in my sandbox!

54:57.293 --> 54:59.676
Remember what I'm offering you here.

54:59.701 --> 55:02.051
Do you want to be on my channel or not?

55:02.141 --> 55:05.063
This deal is off!
But... I...

55:06.907 --> 55:08.665
That felt good!

55:16.395 --> 55:18.286
Time to get real!

55:20.463 --> 55:24.298
I'm gonna be me

55:24.328 --> 55:29.804
And make my own decisions
I'm gonna be free

55:29.829 --> 55:32.553
Unfiltered, nothing missing

55:32.629 --> 55:35.912
Watch me go anywhere

55:35.942 --> 55:39.475
Feel the wind in my hair
And find myself out there in this world

55:39.520 --> 55:43.992
I'm gonna be me
Not a picture-perfect girl

55:45.010 --> 55:48.776
The princess is out there, Taffy.
Let's go get her!

55:55.478 --> 55:58.955
And where are you going in
such a hurry, princess?

56:00.102 --> 56:07.633
Oh, Johan, hi. Or should I say, Barbie?

56:07.697 --> 56:10.229
What are you talking about?
Give it up!

56:10.283 --> 56:12.791
I know you switched places with Amelia.

56:12.816 --> 56:15.361
I saw your necklace
that night on the yacht.

56:15.428 --> 56:17.592
So you've known all along?

56:17.632 --> 56:19.921
Did you think I wouldn't notice?

56:20.004 --> 56:23.957
Once I realized there were two of you,
I put my whole plan into motion.

56:24.080 --> 56:25.259
What?

56:29.066 --> 56:32.363
You have the real princess. Where is she?

56:32.395 --> 56:34.192
Oh, you'll find out soon enough...

56:34.217 --> 56:37.552
when you're thousands of miles away
from here, at sea.

56:37.594 --> 56:39.837
She's on the yacht!
Very good!

56:39.876 --> 56:42.610
You're clever!
You would've made an excellent queen.

56:42.750 --> 56:45.680
Too bad that will never happen.

56:54.016 --> 56:55.828
Let me go!

56:55.868 --> 56:58.469
Do you think they got bacon?
Oh, dude, you know I love...

56:58.504 --> 57:00.996
Trey!
Ha, don't "Trey" me, your Highness.

57:02.000 --> 57:04.797
Yaaaaaa...
We've never met officially...

57:04.822 --> 57:08.039
Get help! Dude, that's Barbie!
And she's in trouble.

57:08.144 --> 57:12.191
Did not see that coming. Huh?

57:12.410 --> 57:15.910
Lock them up.
Didn't see that coming, either.

57:21.644 --> 57:23.597
Hah! Morning sar!

57:27.969 --> 57:32.203
Good girl. We have to save Amelia.
Let's ride.

57:42.082 --> 57:45.910
Trouble at the coronation?
I'll be on the lookout for her.

57:50.133 --> 57:53.852
Go tell the others where we are?
Can you do that?

58:09.764 --> 58:13.083
There she is! You, come back here!

58:18.855 --> 58:20.231
Got her.

58:23.401 --> 58:26.472
Barbie? Oh, not you too.

58:31.811 --> 58:35.139
It seems the princess has run away.

58:35.358 --> 58:40.170
Teenagers! Ha! I'm sure she'll be back
any second. Any second!

58:40.339 --> 58:43.956
And I'm sure she won't be.
You're behind this.

58:44.030 --> 58:48.265
If she doesn't show up...Then I will claim
the crown and be king of both countries...

58:48.369 --> 58:51.244
and no one can stop me. , take him!

58:51.323 --> 58:54.722
What? Let me go!
You won't get away with this!

58:54.754 --> 58:56.870
Oh, I think I will.

58:57.051 --> 59:02.339
You see, having some of my own men
inside the palace has proven very useful.

59:04.799 --> 59:07.151
Quit struggling!

59:07.346 --> 59:08.658
I gotta find Barbie.

59:17.241 --> 59:20.929
I never liked Johan.
He has such sweaty palms.

59:20.986 --> 59:24.931
Right? Anyway, we need to
stop him from taking your crown.

59:25.010 --> 59:28.542
This is not your problem.
I never should've done this.

59:28.567 --> 59:30.221
I'm glad you did.

59:30.436 --> 59:33.858
You showed me I need to stay true to
who I am no matter what.

59:33.932 --> 59:37.190
And you showed me that who I am,
does make a difference.

59:37.266 --> 59:41.422
So, what do you say we go out there
and make a difference... together?

59:42.453 --> 59:45.164
I'm ready. How do we get out of here?

59:49.525 --> 59:53.095
Hmm... I don't think Johan'll
be needing this anymore.

01:00:05.510 --> 01:00:08.518
Hey, what do you think you're doing?
Escaping!

01:00:13.566 --> 01:00:16.458
This way! Hey!

01:00:16.641 --> 01:00:21.141
Ahh! Hi there.
Get them!

01:00:26.390 --> 01:00:28.382
Look, dolphins!

01:00:30.732 --> 01:00:32.670
Yes!
There they are!

01:00:32.740 --> 01:00:33.865
Hurry up!

01:00:35.079 --> 01:00:36.415
Stop them!

01:00:39.590 --> 01:00:41.160
They're on the lower deck!

01:00:41.816 --> 01:00:44.261
We've got nowhere to go.
Yes, we do!

01:00:46.171 --> 01:00:51.593
We're coming, Barbie!
 On three? On one! Jump!

01:00:53.378 --> 01:00:56.081
Yayy! Get it! Yes!

01:00:57.229 --> 01:01:00.393
I knew you'd get my message
but how'd you get the boat?

01:01:00.448 --> 01:01:03.596
An old Floravian tradition
called ride-sharing,

01:01:03.659 --> 01:01:05.752
but we owe that guy another goat.

01:01:05.777 --> 01:01:07.407
Hi!

01:01:09.369 --> 01:01:10.447
Step on it!

01:01:15.987 --> 01:01:17.838
Watch out!

01:01:24.777 --> 01:01:26.176
Thank you very much.

01:01:27.130 --> 01:01:28.560
Hold on!

01:01:34.312 --> 01:01:36.249
Where do you think you're going?!

01:01:40.335 --> 01:01:44.827
Watch it! Uh-oh...

01:02:07.770 --> 01:02:09.910
Head for shore! We can still make it!

01:02:11.595 --> 01:02:16.791
What a terrible situation.
It looks like the princess is a no-show...

01:02:18.146 --> 01:02:20.193
but luckily I am here.

01:02:20.272 --> 01:02:24.600
I humbly offer to take the crown
and become the rightful ruler of...

01:02:25.532 --> 01:02:26.954
Pardon me.

01:02:28.576 --> 01:02:33.779
Not now, I'm kinda in the mid ...
They escaped?! Grr!

01:02:39.501 --> 01:02:41.149
I gotta do something.

01:02:47.383 --> 01:02:49.647
I got eyes on 'em.
Seriously?

01:02:59.336 --> 01:03:00.813
They're gaining on us.

01:03:10.356 --> 01:03:11.396
Not this way.

01:03:23.205 --> 01:03:27.517
I think we all know what happens next
the law is very clear

01:03:27.614 --> 01:03:32.324
If the princess does not appear at the
coronation, both kingdoms pass to me.

01:03:32.393 --> 01:03:36.839
So, without further ado,
play the coronation song already.

01:03:37.392 --> 01:03:39.446
Okay, Taffy, you know what to do.

01:03:45.476 --> 01:03:49.391
What?! Ahh!

01:03:56.450 --> 01:03:59.186
 Impostor! You're not the princess.

01:03:59.211 --> 01:04:02.295
Correct. I am not.
But I am.

01:04:03.255 --> 01:04:05.373
Who is that?
There's two?

01:04:05.514 --> 01:04:10.152
People of Floravia, Johan is trying to
deny you your rightful leader.

01:04:11.988 --> 01:04:16.114
There was a time I thought I couldn't
do this, but not anymore.

01:04:16.309 --> 01:04:19.997
I am ready to be your queen,
if you will have me.

01:04:20.160 --> 01:04:25.160
Look at her: Late, and a mess.
What kind of queen would she make?

01:04:25.448 --> 01:04:28.003
A real one. Arrest him!

01:04:28.949 --> 01:04:31.191
Easy. Get your hands off of me.

01:04:32.335 --> 01:04:34.710
It was his idea. I didn't wanna do it.

01:04:50.537 --> 01:04:53.630
You look amazing.
You too. thanks.

01:04:54.960 --> 01:04:59.413
Thanks. Barbie, I really have
to tell you something. I think I ...

01:05:47.709 --> 01:05:48.717
Dude, yeah!

01:05:48.827 --> 01:05:50.987
Ugh.
We did it! Yeah!

01:05:51.971 --> 01:05:55.885
A vlog? You want to start a royal vlog?

01:05:56.073 --> 01:05:59.316
Written and produced by me,
not you or my team.

01:05:59.341 --> 01:06:03.277
Just me, so I can speak directly to
my people, the way Barbie does.

01:06:03.334 --> 01:06:07.178
If this is your decision, I support it.

01:06:07.286 --> 01:06:11.239
You're ready. You're going to
make a wonderful queen.

01:06:15.474 --> 01:06:18.107
Quick thinking there, with Taffy.

01:06:18.154 --> 01:06:20.162
Thanks, I learned from the best.

01:06:20.295 --> 01:06:23.037
So, what were you gonna say to me?

01:06:23.357 --> 01:06:25.607
Uh... I ...

01:06:25.632 --> 01:06:28.029
Hello, may I have your attention?

01:06:29.298 --> 01:06:32.260
It is my dream to make
Floravia the best country

01:06:32.284 --> 01:06:35.245
it can be, by being
the best queen I can be.

01:06:39.777 --> 01:06:43.050
My new friend Barbie showed me
my dream is possible.

01:06:43.199 --> 01:06:45.363
She made a difference in my life,

01:06:45.410 --> 01:06:48.722
, and now I know how to make
a difference in many more.

01:06:48.883 --> 01:06:52.360
You are such an inspiration, Barbie.
Thank you.

01:06:52.400 --> 01:06:53.595
She's right.

01:06:55.223 --> 01:06:59.231
Barbie, I can't hold back any longer.
I think I ...

01:07:01.369 --> 01:07:03.049
wanna dance with you.

01:07:15.710 --> 01:07:18.593
Used to feel so invisible

01:07:18.632 --> 01:07:21.437
Now you see me, now you don't

01:07:22.928 --> 01:07:25.835
Life was always so typical

01:07:26.076 --> 01:07:29.169
Close my eyes and dream alone

01:07:29.799 --> 01:07:32.192
But the sun is rising

01:07:32.230 --> 01:07:33.894
The sky is shining

01:07:33.919 --> 01:07:36.984
I finally reached the end of the road

01:07:37.840 --> 01:07:41.566
The path is clearer as I get nearer

01:07:41.596 --> 01:07:44.080
Now I think I finally know

01:07:44.189 --> 01:07:48.423
That I-I-I got nothing on my mind

01:07:48.448 --> 01:07:51.798
Aside from what's straight ahead of me

01:07:52.228 --> 01:07:56.322
Now I'm fi-i-inding my arms are open wind

01:07:56.347 --> 01:07:59.295
Cause now I think I finally see

01:07:59.393 --> 01:08:03.630
This is my moment

01:08:03.777 --> 01:08:06.890
I'm singing above the noise

01:08:06.934 --> 01:08:11.040
This is my moment

01:08:11.137 --> 01:08:14.645
I finally found my voice

01:08:14.765 --> 01:08:18.913
My feet on the ground
No backing down

01:08:19.036 --> 01:08:21.843
I'm in the spotlight now

01:08:21.885 --> 01:08:25.356
This is my moment

01:08:25.404 --> 01:08:27.466
So I'm gonna own it

01:08:27.514 --> 01:08:31.069
This is my moment finally

01:08:37.769 --> 01:08:39.495
I can see anything

01:08:39.520 --> 01:08:41.613
When I look into the mirror

01:08:41.638 --> 01:08:45.102
Nothing stopping me
Making my dreams come true

01:08:45.191 --> 01:08:46.754
We can try everything

01:08:46.785 --> 01:08:48.886
It's all a new adventure

01:08:48.930 --> 01:08:52.210
Let's step it up
And mix it up, yeah

01:08:52.698 --> 01:08:56.363
Say hello to
All the side of you

01:08:56.441 --> 01:08:59.706
You never know who you might find

01:09:00.452 --> 01:09:02.444
The path is brighter

01:09:02.469 --> 01:09:03.835
It's getting wider

01:09:03.888 --> 01:09:07.529
Now I think it's finally time.

01:09:07.770 --> 01:09:10.388
I-I-I got
One billion views?! Ugh!

01:09:10.844 --> 01:09:13.875
Aside from what's straight ahead of me

01:09:14.692 --> 01:09:18.858
Now I'm fi-i-inding my arms are open wide

01:09:18.883 --> 01:09:21.787
Cause now I think I finally see

01:09:21.813 --> 01:09:23.750
Try it on

01:09:23.774 --> 01:09:27.883
Barbie and This is my moment

01:09:27.964 --> 01:09:31.229
I'm singing above the noise

01:09:31.249 --> 01:09:35.460
This is my moment

01:09:35.559 --> 01:09:38.910
I finally found my voice

01:09:39.133 --> 01:09:43.367
My feet on the ground
No backing down

01:09:43.428 --> 01:09:46.233
I’m in the spotlight now

01:09:46.268 --> 01:09:49.716
This is my moment

01:09:49.763 --> 01:09:51.863
So I'm gonna own it

01:09:51.910 --> 01:09:55.731
This is my moment finally
