WEBVTT

00:09.300 --> 00:10.760
Ba-bum.

00:11.845 --> 00:12.971
[croaks]

00:14.764 --> 00:15.890
[panting]

00:41.124 --> 00:42.333
[horse neighs]

01:23.249 --> 01:24.459
[horse neighs]

01:26.544 --> 01:27.545
[soldiers yell]

01:41.935 --> 01:43.102
[soldier yells]

01:50.568 --> 01:51.569
[soldier screams]

02:26.980 --> 02:27.981
[grunts]

02:29.190 --> 02:30.984
[horse neighing]

02:43.788 --> 02:45.790
[theme music playing]

02:55.842 --> 02:58.636
[Callum]  It feels like a lifetime
since we left home...

02:59.178 --> 03:00.680
but it's only been a week.

03:05.184 --> 03:08.855
We left because we found something
the world thought was destroyed...

03:09.397 --> 03:11.482
the egg of the Dragon Prince!

03:12.692 --> 03:16.237
Ezran and I decided to take a dangerous
journey across the world...

03:17.780 --> 03:20.950
and carry this precious egg home
to its mother in Xadia.

03:21.034 --> 03:24.037
Maybe then we can stop the war.

03:25.455 --> 03:30.710
It's been an amazing adventure.
I'm even learning how to do magic!

03:30.793 --> 03:31.628
Ow!

03:35.381 --> 03:37.050
Though it hasn't always been easy.

03:37.133 --> 03:40.303
In fact, it's probably been
the hardest thing we've ever done.

03:40.386 --> 03:41.596
[indistinct yelling]

03:41.679 --> 03:43.556
But we haven't done it alone.

03:43.640 --> 03:45.808
We've been traveling
with a new friend, Rayla,

03:45.892 --> 03:47.810
who is a Moonshadow elf.

03:47.894 --> 03:50.688
Nothing I believed about elves is true.

03:51.439 --> 03:56.653
Rayla is kind and good.
She's fearless, fast, strong...

03:56.736 --> 03:58.947
[Rayla]  And daring. Oh, so daring!

03:59.030 --> 04:02.283
Hey, have you just been
standing there the whole time?

04:02.367 --> 04:04.869
[scoffs] Don't let me interrupt.

04:04.953 --> 04:08.539
You were looking for another
good word to describe me, right?

04:08.623 --> 04:11.376
Well, I consider myself quite daring.

04:11.459 --> 04:12.293
Quite?

04:13.044 --> 04:17.131
Well, I'll be sure to tell my stepdad how
"quite daring" you are.

04:17.215 --> 04:20.593
You're writing a letter... to the king?

04:21.928 --> 04:23.221
He'll be worried about us.

04:23.888 --> 04:27.433
It'll mean a lot to him to know
why we left, and that we're doing okay.

04:28.017 --> 04:30.520
In journeys, there are always surprises.

04:30.603 --> 04:32.021
[shrieking]

04:32.105 --> 04:34.565
-Things never go as you plan.
-[roaring]

04:34.649 --> 04:38.695
We dropped the egg,
and thought all was lost.

04:39.320 --> 04:41.990
But something incredible happened.

04:42.073 --> 04:46.953
Now, instead of carrying an egg to Xadia,
we're taking care of someone new.

04:47.578 --> 04:50.415
The most powerful creature
in the entire world.

04:50.915 --> 04:51.791
[yips]

04:53.918 --> 04:54.877
[exclaims]

04:57.171 --> 04:59.048
[both laughing]

05:00.133 --> 05:01.301
[growls]

05:02.885 --> 05:03.886
[yips]

05:06.472 --> 05:10.310
[Viren]  Dragons!
The Xadian threat grows every day.

05:10.393 --> 05:13.479
There have been sightings of
terrifying shadows in the clouds,

05:13.563 --> 05:16.107
flying high above the towns
and cities of Katolis.

05:16.816 --> 05:20.236
War dragons!
We must take action.

05:20.862 --> 05:22.822
No, we should wait.

05:23.364 --> 05:25.700
Xadia sent assassins
and they took the king's life.

05:25.783 --> 05:28.244
And we must answer!

05:28.328 --> 05:32.915
There hasn't even been the slightest
skirmish since then. Maybe that was it?

05:32.999 --> 05:36.544
They've had their revenge,
and everything will just settle down now.

05:36.627 --> 05:40.214
Settle down?
Can't you see the danger we're in?

05:40.882 --> 05:44.719
[sighs] General Amaya reports
that elven forces are gathering

05:44.802 --> 05:46.888
on the Xadian side of the Breach.

05:46.971 --> 05:51.559
We must be prepared to fight, and we
won't be able to fight them alone.

05:52.769 --> 05:54.937
We must call for
a summit of the Pentarchy.

05:55.021 --> 05:57.065
You're out of order, Lord Viren.

05:57.148 --> 05:59.484
Only a king or queen
can call for a summit.

06:00.026 --> 06:02.403
Frankly, I doubt the other rulers
will even look at a message

06:02.487 --> 06:04.072
that doesn't bear the king's seal.

06:04.155 --> 06:06.991
But this is a crisis
of historic proportions.

06:07.533 --> 06:09.243
Humanity could face extinction

06:09.327 --> 06:12.789
if we don't work with the other
four kingdoms to do something!

06:12.872 --> 06:15.833
None of that matters
while we have no king.

06:16.334 --> 06:20.880
Therefore, our top and only priority
must be finding the princes.

06:20.963 --> 06:23.800
Until we do, our hands are tied.

06:28.930 --> 06:30.640
Come and get it, everyone.

06:32.809 --> 06:35.103
Elves and humans over here,

06:35.186 --> 06:38.314
and those with three or more legs
can sit there, with Phoe-Phoe!

06:38.815 --> 06:40.650
You named her Phoe-Phoe?

06:41.275 --> 06:45.488
She is a Moon Phoenix.
Her name is short for "Phoenix-Phoenix."

06:45.571 --> 06:46.572
[Phoe-Phoe exclaims]

06:47.406 --> 06:50.451
You have the best food up here.
What's your secret?

06:50.535 --> 06:56.040
Well, my secret is...
is that it's all fake.

06:56.666 --> 06:59.252
-What do you mean?
-You know, fake.

06:59.794 --> 07:02.004
They're delicious illusions.

07:02.088 --> 07:04.590
You're actually eating grubs.

07:05.216 --> 07:06.050
[groans]

07:06.134 --> 07:10.805
Oh, you must mean "grub."
As in, "Wow, this is some good grub."

07:10.888 --> 07:15.184
No. Do you see what Phoe-Phoe is eating?

07:15.268 --> 07:17.812
-[Phoe-Phoe chomping]
-[Ezran] That bowl of worms?

07:17.895 --> 07:21.649
[Lujanne] Yes, that's right.
Those are grubs!

07:22.692 --> 07:23.568
[groans]

07:24.735 --> 07:26.654
I don't care. [swallows]

07:26.737 --> 07:29.991
This illusion pie
is the best I've ever had.

07:30.741 --> 07:31.951
[Ezran retches]

07:32.535 --> 07:34.120
Hey, everybody.

07:34.203 --> 07:35.830
Well, you're in a good mood.

07:35.913 --> 07:38.958
It does feel good to have two
working hands again.

07:39.750 --> 07:43.004
-Uh... no offense, Ava.
-[barks]

07:43.087 --> 07:46.382
I can slish and slash
with both swords again!

07:46.466 --> 07:49.177
I can clap.
[claps] Do handstands...

07:51.804 --> 07:55.475
I can even do that thing you do when you
finish a nice song and dance, you know?

07:55.558 --> 07:57.226
[exclaims]

07:57.310 --> 07:59.854
And how's everybody else feeling?

08:00.438 --> 08:01.481
-[Ezran] Amazing!
-Great!

08:01.564 --> 08:03.232
-Fantastic!
-Good!

08:03.316 --> 08:04.484
â€˜Cause it's time to go.

08:04.567 --> 08:05.401
-[Callum] What?
-[Ellis] No!

08:05.485 --> 08:07.028
-We can't!
-[Ezran] Why do we have to go?

08:07.111 --> 08:08.821
We've only been here two days.

08:08.905 --> 08:11.282
Danger's coming for us, I know it.

08:11.365 --> 08:13.993
The longer we stay here,
the higher the risk.

08:14.535 --> 08:17.997
Hmm, she's right.
The night the Dragon Prince was born...

08:18.080 --> 08:20.333
[sighs] I sensed something amiss.

08:21.250 --> 08:23.836
Those strange purple wisps...

08:23.920 --> 08:25.963
Dark forces are pursuing you.

08:26.047 --> 08:29.217
Nobody likes dark forces, which is why...

08:32.136 --> 08:34.847
-Making use of those two hands, huh?
-You bet.

08:35.431 --> 08:38.059
Besides, we've got
precious cargo to deliver.

08:38.601 --> 08:41.187
War is coming like the world's never seen,

08:41.270 --> 08:43.856
unless we get the wee dragon
home to his mum.

08:45.024 --> 08:46.067
[Bait grunts]

08:46.150 --> 08:50.321
But Zym, he's so little.
He still needs to learn how to fly.

08:50.404 --> 08:55.117
[chuckles] You seem to have a special
connection to the dragonling.

08:55.201 --> 08:57.161
Perhaps you could teach him?

08:57.245 --> 08:59.413
Me? I could try.

08:59.497 --> 09:02.959
And I was hoping to learn something
about Moon Magic while we're here.

09:03.042 --> 09:07.088
Hmm. I could show you some things.

09:07.171 --> 09:09.465
Hey! I thought you were on my side?

09:09.549 --> 09:11.884
A few more days, Rayla,
that's all we're asking.

09:12.426 --> 09:17.139
[sighs] Fine. One extra day. One!

09:17.223 --> 09:19.433
But I'm serious about the danger.

09:19.517 --> 09:23.729
I'll keep patrolling.
Everyone else, stay on your toes!

09:24.355 --> 09:28.192
Except you.
You work on getting off those toes.

09:28.859 --> 09:30.319
[yips sheepishly]

09:35.408 --> 09:38.703
I can't believe I'm going to learn magic
from a real mage!

09:38.786 --> 09:40.371
How do you know I'm real?

09:40.955 --> 09:42.373
Uh...

09:43.416 --> 09:44.875
Don't worry, I'm real.

09:46.586 --> 09:48.671
This is the Moonhenge.

09:49.547 --> 09:52.383
Thousands of years ago,
when Xadia was one land,

09:52.466 --> 09:57.638
the ancient ancestors of Moonshadow elves
performed fantastic rituals here.

09:59.140 --> 10:00.891
Historia Viventem.

10:06.397 --> 10:07.231
[gasps]

10:18.909 --> 10:22.204
[Lujanne] The legends say
they could use the power of the Nexus

10:22.288 --> 10:27.168
to open a portal to another plane.
A shimmering world beyond life and death!

10:32.965 --> 10:35.885
[Callum] But it's ruins now.
What happened?

10:36.677 --> 10:41.432
The Moon Druids destroyed it themselves
when Xadia was divided in two.

10:42.099 --> 10:46.145
They decided it was safer
to disable this magical place.

10:47.063 --> 10:48.272
That's so sad.

10:48.856 --> 10:52.860
Ever since then, there has always
been a guardian of the Nexus.

10:52.943 --> 10:58.741
A mage, like myself, whose duty
is to prevent humans from discovering it.

10:59.492 --> 11:03.746
What happens when humans do discover it?
Do you...

11:03.829 --> 11:05.706
[exclaims] like, kill them?

11:06.374 --> 11:13.255
[laughs] Nah, why kill them when you can
break their brains with insane illusions?

11:13.339 --> 11:17.927
I've got some real mind melters.
They would completely freak your bean.

11:18.511 --> 11:19.553
Interested?

11:20.429 --> 11:21.263
I'll pass.

11:21.889 --> 11:25.267
Okay, it's time to buckle down
and get to work.

11:25.351 --> 11:27.436
[Bait chattering]

11:28.437 --> 11:30.564
[Ezran] Flying is a natural
and beautiful thing.

11:31.399 --> 11:33.651
Now, that doesn't mean
it's going to be easy.

11:33.734 --> 11:35.611
[Bait grunts loudly]

11:35.694 --> 11:37.738
You don't need to keep doing that.

11:38.364 --> 11:39.240
[Bait groans]

11:39.323 --> 11:42.451
Ready, Zym? Wings out... and flap!

11:44.286 --> 11:45.162
[Zym grunts]

11:45.246 --> 11:47.540
Come on! You have to flap those wings.

11:48.749 --> 11:49.583
[Zym groans]

11:50.292 --> 11:51.627
Oh, no, are you okay?

11:52.420 --> 11:54.088
[growls]

11:55.589 --> 11:58.217
One more time. We'll try it nice and slow.

11:58.801 --> 12:00.511
[slowly] Flap...

12:01.887 --> 12:03.514
[growls]

12:06.851 --> 12:11.397
[chuckles] That's not flying,
but it's a very, very good start.

12:11.480 --> 12:12.898
[scoffs]

12:21.991 --> 12:24.743
[soldiers clamoring faintly]

13:38.859 --> 13:42.279
"Oh, can't we stay a bit longer
so I can learn some magic tricks?"

13:42.363 --> 13:47.284
And, "Oh, I wanna play around
with the wee dragon." [scoffs] Humans!

13:47.952 --> 13:52.414
Only the noble elf cares about keeping
us all alive, apparently.

13:53.749 --> 13:58.337
There's something out here, I know it.
Something bad.

13:58.420 --> 13:59.964
[rustling]

14:01.882 --> 14:03.384
[birds cawing]

14:18.399 --> 14:19.483
[chittering]

14:21.026 --> 14:22.319
[shrieking]

14:24.154 --> 14:28.117
Ugh, you again.
Save it for someone who cares.

14:30.703 --> 14:33.330
[whimpers]

14:36.417 --> 14:40.588
And we're back.
This time we're here with a special guest.

14:40.671 --> 14:44.425
She's mystical, magical, moon-powered
and she knows how to fly.

14:44.508 --> 14:47.428
-[chirps]
-Please welcome Phoe-Phoe!

14:49.346 --> 14:51.891
Ready, Phoe-Phoe? Show him how it's done.

14:55.561 --> 14:56.812
See? It's easy.

14:56.896 --> 14:59.815
-[chittering]
-[Ezran] Yes! Yes, that's right!

15:03.694 --> 15:06.071
Now, I'm going to show you
what flying feels like.

15:10.117 --> 15:13.746
Can you feel it? Can you feel
the whoosh of the air beneath your wings?

15:14.580 --> 15:16.457
[Zym chittering]

15:16.540 --> 15:21.378
-He's doing it! He's amazing!
-Yes, yes! You can do this!

15:24.131 --> 15:25.007
[gasps]

15:25.090 --> 15:28.218
Ezran, you killed the Dragon Prince!

15:28.719 --> 15:32.681
Oh, no! I'm so stupid!
Oh, no, no, no!

15:35.768 --> 15:37.186
[yips]

15:37.269 --> 15:41.815
I'm so sorry, I wasn't trying to hurt you,
I promise. Are you okay?

15:42.942 --> 15:43.776
[spits and chirps]

15:44.777 --> 15:45.778
[groans]

15:47.488 --> 15:50.074
[Lujanne] Though Primal Energy
is everywhere,

15:50.157 --> 15:54.244
it may be weaker or stronger
at different times and places.

15:54.912 --> 15:57.706
The ocean is strongest at high tide,

15:57.790 --> 16:02.252
sky is strongest in a storm, and the moon
is strongest--

16:02.336 --> 16:03.587
When it's full!

16:03.671 --> 16:06.507
Please don't interrupt, but, yes.

16:06.590 --> 16:11.845
And there is more. There are six special
places where the magic of Primal Energies

16:11.929 --> 16:17.851
are most pure and powerful in this world.
Such a place is called a Nexus.

16:19.353 --> 16:22.272
This is the Moon Nexus.

16:24.233 --> 16:26.568
It reflects the moon perfectly.

16:27.069 --> 16:30.948
When the moon is full,
its light completely fills the lake.

16:33.200 --> 16:36.453
I love this. I love learning about magic.

16:37.287 --> 16:40.791
But I want you to teach me to do
some Moon Magic.

16:41.917 --> 16:43.377
You know, maybe some hands-on learning.

16:43.460 --> 16:49.049
We get in there, you show me how to do
a moon beam, a moon ray, a moon... shine?

16:50.259 --> 16:52.136
Humans can't do magic.

16:52.219 --> 16:54.888
Um... but I did do magic.

16:54.972 --> 16:57.975
Right, with a Primal Stone.

16:58.058 --> 17:02.688
But then you smashed it, so now
you're just a standard human again.

17:03.439 --> 17:06.483
Ah, but look on the bright side,
you've got those extra fingers.

17:06.567 --> 17:10.154
The little ones,
what do you call them? Pinkos!

17:10.696 --> 17:13.115
But I know other humans who do magic.

17:14.116 --> 17:19.204
We do not call that practice magic.
It's an atrocity.

17:20.664 --> 17:24.626
This can't be.
I thought magic was my thing.

17:24.710 --> 17:26.128
I was good at it.

17:27.296 --> 17:29.423
It looks like you could use some cake.

17:30.966 --> 17:32.593
That's really a plate of worms.

17:33.135 --> 17:38.807
[laughs] Ah, you're too smart
for old Lujanne's illusions!

17:38.891 --> 17:44.229
How about some nice
old-fashioned iced-cream? Hmm?

17:45.022 --> 17:46.690
[groans] Worms again.

17:51.236 --> 17:52.112
[sighs]

17:52.696 --> 17:56.533
So, he had a whole day of training.
Can he fly now?

17:56.617 --> 17:59.912
No, not yet. I'm doing my best, Rayla.

18:00.454 --> 18:03.123
And so are you. I know you are.

18:04.583 --> 18:06.919
Well, either way, we're leaving tomorrow.

18:07.419 --> 18:10.964
There's danger coming, I know it.
We have to get moving.

18:11.048 --> 18:12.633
Then we should all get some rest.

18:12.716 --> 18:14.343
Nope, not for me.

18:14.426 --> 18:17.805
I'm going out on patrol again.
One more perimeter check.

18:17.888 --> 18:18.722
[exclaims]

18:22.226 --> 18:23.185
[sighs]

18:24.061 --> 18:26.396
-Tough day?
-You could say that.

18:26.480 --> 18:30.484
Us too. Lots of jumping and flapping,
but no flying.

18:31.068 --> 18:34.363
But we'll get it.
No matter how impossible it seems.

18:34.863 --> 18:38.992
We believe in ourself,
and we're not giving up, are we?

18:41.411 --> 18:44.414
Know what? Neither am I.

18:49.294 --> 18:50.921
[crows cawing]

18:56.385 --> 18:57.261
Crow Lord.

18:58.345 --> 19:02.349
[clears throat] Crow Lord.
You! Sir! Crow Lord!

19:02.891 --> 19:05.727
Oh! Sorry, I heard you calling
for the Crow Lord.

19:05.811 --> 19:07.062
Uh, he's not here right now.

19:07.980 --> 19:09.481
Then, who are you?

19:09.565 --> 19:11.942
Oh! Well, I'm... I'm the Crow Master.

19:13.819 --> 19:17.906
It's sort of like... Assistant Crow Lord.
I just got promoted.

19:18.991 --> 19:21.285
Congratulations.
Are you able to send the mail?

19:21.368 --> 19:23.120
Sure! Sure, of course!

19:25.956 --> 19:31.628
Oh, um... hmm. These...
these seem to bear the king's seal.

19:31.712 --> 19:33.005
Yes.

19:33.088 --> 19:38.218
Well, uh... yikes.
Uh, the king is... you know...

19:39.595 --> 19:40.971
I can't send these.

19:41.054 --> 19:46.560
Hmm. I understand your dilemma.
You were recently promoted, yes?

19:46.643 --> 19:48.437
And you are trying to do a good job?

19:48.520 --> 19:50.022
Yes. Yes, exactly.

19:50.105 --> 19:55.485
Right, well let me be
perfectly clear, Crow Master.

19:55.569 --> 20:00.157
You will send these to the leaders
of the other four kingdoms immediately.

20:00.782 --> 20:05.120
If you refuse, you will also be...
you know.

20:05.621 --> 20:08.081
Um, now that I think about it,

20:08.165 --> 20:11.710
I'm just gonna go ahead
and take care of these for you.

20:11.793 --> 20:14.087
Mmm, I thought you might.

20:15.380 --> 20:16.798
[crow cawing]

20:25.557 --> 20:26.683
[Callum] You're wrong.

20:26.767 --> 20:30.187
Callum! What are you doing here?
It's late.

20:30.270 --> 20:32.564
-I'm never giving up.
-Callum...

20:33.148 --> 20:36.818
Growing up, I was supposed to learn
horseback riding, sword fighting,

20:36.902 --> 20:40.197
archery, battle tactics,
but I was so bad at everything.

20:41.240 --> 20:44.534
But then, you didn't give up?
And you got good?

20:44.618 --> 20:49.998
Well, no, I gave those up,
but then I tried magic, and it felt right.

20:50.582 --> 20:52.501
It felt like I was finally
good at something.

20:53.252 --> 20:56.713
I will learn magic. It's who I am.

20:57.381 --> 21:00.676
Hmm. I admire your determination.

21:01.301 --> 21:04.304
But learning magic is not your destiny.

21:04.846 --> 21:10.602
You can't do Primal Magic because you
weren't born connected to a Primal Source.

21:10.686 --> 21:13.021
I don't get it.
What do you mean, "connected"?

21:13.105 --> 21:18.443
In Xadia, all creatures are born
connected to a Primal Source.

21:20.445 --> 21:25.367
They have a piece of it inside them.
We call that piece an arcanum.

21:25.450 --> 21:26.868
Wait, what's an arcanum?

21:26.952 --> 21:30.706
It's like... the secret of the Primal,
or its meaning.

21:31.498 --> 21:34.001
-The secret of the Primal?
-Yes.

21:34.584 --> 21:37.170
That secret becomes a spark.

21:37.796 --> 21:42.676
The tiniest possible flicker
of a Primal Source inside you.

21:42.759 --> 21:46.013
But enough to ignite the world
with its magic.

21:46.096 --> 21:47.097
[wind whistles]

21:47.180 --> 21:50.058
All right, so what is it?
What's the arcanum of the moon?

21:50.142 --> 21:55.731
It's something I just... know.
It's not easily put into words.

21:55.814 --> 21:59.401
-Well, try. Please.
-Very well.

21:59.985 --> 22:03.947
The arcanum of the moon is about
understanding the relationship

22:04.031 --> 22:07.659
between appearances and reality.

22:07.743 --> 22:13.623
Most people believe that reality is truth
and appearances are deceiving.

22:13.707 --> 22:16.501
But those of us who know the moon arcanum

22:16.585 --> 22:21.173
understand we can only truly know
the appearance itself.

22:21.256 --> 22:23.675
You can never touch the so-called reality

22:23.759 --> 22:26.470
that lies just beyond the reach
of your own perception.

22:29.931 --> 22:30.974
I'm confused.

22:31.808 --> 22:35.979
I don't blame you.
After all, you're only human.

23:19.272 --> 23:21.775
[ocarina playing faintly]

23:29.116 --> 23:30.325
[sighs]

23:40.836 --> 23:42.212
[ocarina continues]

23:55.892 --> 23:56.935
Do it.
